[Alec]    <i> Previously</i>
<i> on    </i> Shadowhunters...

00:05.706 --> 00:06.939
Simon...
What?

00:06.941 --> 00:08.173
You were kidnapped
by vampires, okay?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.275
<i>You of all people should know</i>
<i>how dangerous it is out there.</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:12.111
I'll be fine.
Seelies have their charm.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.613
<i>Izzy can tell you</i>
<i>all about them.</i>
<i>She's got a thing.</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:16.682
We've all got
our things, don't we?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.183
[Magnus]
<i> The demon demands payment.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.286
We must each
relinquish a beloved memory
of the one we love the most.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.341
It's not true.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.026
Keep this with you
and think of me
when you wear it.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.797
Give me the Cup!

00:34.702 --> 00:36.068
And he spoke to you?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.803
He said my name.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.471
He said, "Your mother
for the Cup."

00:39.473 --> 00:40.806
[Alec] Who said that?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.641
[both] Valentine.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.842
He's with my mother.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.878
And he can speak to you
through that necklace?

00:45.880 --> 00:46.979
Here, in the Institute?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.313
It's like when I saw Dot.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.416
It's a Portal shard.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.684
That's why your mother
made sure you had it.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.887
All I know
is what I saw...

00:54.889 --> 00:56.321
My mother's alive.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.190
She's unconscious,
but alive.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.324
Where are they?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.726
[stammers] I don't know.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.494
But you said
you saw them.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.396
Were there any
identifying
characteristics?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.898
Equipment, weapons,
photographs?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.499
I don't remember.
It was awful.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.667
Alec, lighten up.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.903
I'm trying to get
something we can use
out of this.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.106
Clary, what did
you see, exactly?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.675
Valentine has my mother.
That's what I saw.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.511
Emotions are nothing
but a distraction.
You're ruled by them.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.013
We're taught
to control them.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.748
And how is that
working out for ya?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.249
[Alec] It is my job
to protect the Institute.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.752
If Valentine can see in,
that's a door I have to shut.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.756
Now... let me take
a look at that thing.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.598
Now, it's in
the proper hands.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.267
Hey!

01:42.269 --> 01:43.402
Alec...

01:43.404 --> 01:45.037
where are you going?

01:45.039 --> 01:47.739
To put this somewhere safe.
Where no one could
be tempted to use it.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.875
[Clary scoffing]
We should use it.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.643
Alec, we should use it
to get to Valentine.

01:51.645 --> 01:55.114
If I were Valentine,
I'd make you think that
you could rescue Jocelyn.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.050
And then I'd lure Clary
to me and leverage
her life for the Cup.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.519
[Clary] I like Jace's idea.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.754
We saved Simon from
the vampires that way.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.056
Yeah...

02:05.559 --> 02:06.792
vampires.

02:06.794 --> 02:10.195
Bored, decadent,
self-involved vampires.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.067
Valentine is a real threat.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.340
He can't be handled
by three-and-a-half
Shadowhunters.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.475
Four.
Whatever.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.477
Leave it there.

02:45.432 --> 02:46.865
There you are.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.768
Are you okay?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.938
I saw my mom.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.307
Then your brother--
I heard.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.277
And believe me,
there have been many times
where I wanted to kill Alec.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.511
[sighs]

03:00.381 --> 03:02.080
[sighs]

03:05.619 --> 03:08.854
Look, I know my brother can be
a real pain in the ass...

03:08.856 --> 03:10.689
[chuckles] but he means well.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.691
That necklace is
very dangerous.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.226
I'll take the risk
on my own.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.795
The problem is,
you're not
on your own, Clary.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.230
You're part of us now.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.364
[sighs]

03:20.701 --> 03:22.134
I just-- I wish I
knew what to do.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.902
All of this,
it's so new to me.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.637
I just...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.539
[sighs]

03:27.541 --> 03:29.041
I'll do anything
to save her.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.210
I get it.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.711
You love her.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.780
More than anything.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.382
What's your mom like?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.985
She's kind.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.186
Fun.

03:41.188 --> 03:44.256
Uh... the kinda person
you always
want to be around.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.659
I have friends who
used to always want to
hang out at our house,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.094
just to hang out with her.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.495
[both laughing]

03:50.497 --> 03:53.165
She sounds more like
a friend than a mom.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.566
She was both.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.269
She's basically
sacrificed
her life for me,

03:57.271 --> 04:00.572
and I'm willing to
do the same for her.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.742
Just because you can't
have that necklace,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.611
doesn't mean you
won't see her again.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.682
Walk with me. Tell me
everything about her.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.357
So, Alec blew right by you
and did what he wanted.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.691
I'd be angry, too.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.027
He took the only way
I had to see my mother.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.263
Plus, he kept asking
what Valentine's
room looked like.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.198
He was interested
in Valentine's style?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.532
[scoffing] Fascinating...

04:27.534 --> 04:29.067
No, he thought
I might have seen

04:29.069 --> 04:31.370
something that could
help us find him.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.871
And did you?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.940
I didn't see
anything there, but...

04:34.942 --> 04:36.775
I think I might
know another way.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.948
Isabelle.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.550
Dressed to impress, I see.

04:45.552 --> 04:49.254
And you've been playing
with the family heirlooms.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.656
Hi, I'm Clary Fray.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.457
Clary Fairchild.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.259
You look just
like your mother.
[inhaling sharply]

04:54.261 --> 04:55.661
We know all
about you in Idris.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.330
Idris?
The Shadowhunter homeland.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.333
If you think
the Institute is well-hidden,
wait until you see that place.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.169
How's Max?
We all miss him.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.605
Little brother.
Cute but clingy.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.073
Kinda Simon-ish.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.941
Robert's picking him up
at the Mumbai Institute.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.345
Where's Jace?
We have a situation
that has to be handled now.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.349
Well, that's my mom.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.277
Is your mom
always like that?

05:45.279 --> 05:47.212
She didn't even hug you.
[chuckles]

05:47.214 --> 05:49.014
Shadowhunters
aren't big huggers.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.752
[Jace grunts]

05:56.724 --> 05:58.657
[panting] Maryse.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.625
[laughing] Hey.
It's great to see you.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.228
How's everyone
in Idris?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.629
Where's, uh... where's Max?
[Isabelle] No Max.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.698
Just Mom with
her hair on fire.

06:07.301 --> 06:11.069
I love how Shadowhunters
share. A hidden brother,
and a secret country,

06:11.071 --> 06:12.804
and a private Portal.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.140
Mother. Welcome back.
We didn't expect you.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.343
You should be prepared,
whether you expect me or not.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.979
I am.
We are.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.681
We'll talk about
the Institute later.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.750
Right now, we have
a bigger problem.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.985
The Seelies have
stopped communicating

06:26.987 --> 06:29.154
with the Clave and
won't explain why.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.590
My guess is
they're still upset

06:31.592 --> 06:34.393
we asked them to send scouts
to look for Valentine,

06:34.395 --> 06:36.228
but no one in
their realm will talk.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.097
I have Seelie friends.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.466
Yes, I know about
your friends.

06:45.005 --> 06:49.174
Isabelle, we stay separate
from the Downworld
for good reasons.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.109
The wrong move,
the wrong word...

06:51.111 --> 06:53.512
Do you think
there is such a thing
as harmless rebellion?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.580
Who knows what offends
these creatures?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.282
Maybe you told him... them...

06:57.284 --> 06:58.850
something they
shouldn't know.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.420
Maybe you trod on one of
their ridiculous customs
without knowing it.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.455
[Jace] Wait, wait.
I don't understand.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.857
You're laying all this
on Izzy for having
a friend in the Downworld?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.860
When someone upsets
the natural order,
everything falls apart.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.062
Natural order?
What are you saying?

07:11.064 --> 07:12.130
I can help.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.467
I know how to
talk to Seelies.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.902
[Alec] She's right.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.637
She can visit with Meliorn
and see what he knows.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.971
I could go with
her if you want.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.641
I'd rather Jace
goes along this time.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.877
[inhaling deeply]
Alec, you stay with
the Fairchild girl.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.312
I want her under control.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.481
She's caused enough
trouble already.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.150
Maybe that's because
I wasn't even a Shadowhunter
until a few days ago!

07:32.152 --> 07:34.486
And what an exciting
few days it has been.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.890
The Clave counts
on us Lightwoods
to maintain order here.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.991
You don't need
to tell me that.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.226
If the mission is
important to the Clave,

07:41.228 --> 07:43.295
I would prefer to be the one
who goes with Isabelle.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.231
[chuckles] You're all
so eager to do
what you would prefer.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.433
It's time to face the truth.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.634
Life is not about
what you want to do,
it's about what must be done.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.472
I have given you
your assignments,
now carry them out.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.208
You and you,
with me, now.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.716
Well, that was
a window into the weird.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.352
What did you do
to piss off your mom?

08:07.354 --> 08:10.021
I'd guess, for a start...

08:10.023 --> 08:11.690
all the unsanctioned
missions on your behalf

08:11.692 --> 08:13.758
didn't go over that big
with the Clave.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.862
[sighs]

08:32.613 --> 08:34.663
Glad to see
you're keeping busy.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.714
Logging all these
false confessions
in the demonic murders.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.318
Here's a lady in
a fifth floor walkup
in Bushwick with 15 cats.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.786
Fifteen!

08:41.788 --> 08:43.688
Demonic murders?
You got anything?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.957
Apart from being
drained of blood,

08:45.959 --> 08:48.560
it looked like
there was no connection
between any of the victims.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.928
But check this out.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.898
Everyone was
getting treated
for psychiatric care

08:52.900 --> 08:54.533
and taking meds
for hallucinations.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.068
And what'd they see?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.204
Vampires,
werewolves, demons.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.372
The Shadow World.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.308
They were mundanes
with the Sight.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.043
Vic's drained of blood.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.846
Looks like Valentine's
been experimenting again...

09:07.848 --> 09:09.848
just like the old days.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.383
What's his endgame?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.184
Before he found
Jocelyn and Clary,

09:13.186 --> 09:15.320
I'd say he was
building an army
to go against the Clave.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.656
But now he'll just
use his soldiers
to get the Mortal Cup.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.391
And he'll destroy
the Downworlds.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.927
I've got to find Clary.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.829
Luke, we need you
to keep your badge.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.831
For everybody's sake.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.433
This is coming from
higher up than me.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.268
Then you need to be
my eyes and ears.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.670
Go look for Clary.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.338
If you find anything,
call me right away.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.040
Valentine's desperate
to find her.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.776
Yeah. Him and
everybody else.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.910
I'll find her.

10:11.545 --> 10:12.811
[elevator bell dings]

10:12.813 --> 10:14.546
[Jace] You're the acting
head of this Institute.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.381
If there's
a diplomatic mission,
you should go.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.149
Let's switch
assignments.
Nope.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.052
This time I'm actually
gonna obey orders,
and babysit your girlfriend.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.487
Clary?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.389
She's more like
my responsibility.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.392
Hey, you'll keep
an eye on her, right?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.462
What is wrong with you?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.198
[inhales]

10:34.234 --> 10:35.533
I, uh...

10:37.004 --> 10:39.237
[stuttering] You
have every right
to be mad at me.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.240
What did you do?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.009
Throw my leather jacket
in the washing machine again?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.710
This isn't a joke.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.484
At Magnus's.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.687
The demon... image of you.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.856
That?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.027
You love me... so?

11:03.497 --> 11:04.996
I love you, too, Alec.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.134
Come on, man.
We're    <i> parabatai.</i>

11:09.136 --> 11:11.102
We're brothers.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.470
We've spent almost
our whole lives together.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.205
How could we not
love each other?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.008
This is what's
been bothering you?
Seriously?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.178
[stuttering] Yeah.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.281
You're right.
That's true.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.150
[stammering] I just thought
you'd think that--

11:25.152 --> 11:26.718
What?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.121
Whatever, okay.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.857
If you want to follow
Mom's orders tonight,
that's great. But...

11:33.894 --> 11:35.694
please,
just do me one favor...

11:36.563 --> 11:38.430
Swear to me you won't
take your eyes off of Clary.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.100
I...

11:43.203 --> 11:44.569
I can't believe
I even asked you that.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.604
[chuckles] You
won't let me down.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.085
Excuse me.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.154
Are you insane
or just an idiot?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.622
Huh?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.324
What are you
after, anyway?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.994
To tell you the truth...
I don't know.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.429
[scoffing]

12:11.431 --> 12:14.733
You can't think I'm
interested in saving
your worthless life again?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.402
Honestly, no.
No, I don't think that.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.005
Get out of here
and don't come back.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.175
Go. Now.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.844
[snarling]

12:36.089 --> 12:38.890
[sighs] Looks like we're
stuck with each other.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.225
For what it's worth,
I think your mom

12:40.227 --> 12:41.459
was too tough
on you out there.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.661
Mothers are like that.
Mine's not.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.898
Go ahead.
Knock me on my ass.
You'll feel better.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.200
Don't make me say
you're right
about something.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.535
Plant your feet wide.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.438
Why did you let your mom
say all those awful
things about Izzy?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.073
[Clary grunts]

12:55.075 --> 12:56.741
Don't step
into the strike.
Step through it.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.810
[sighs]
Izzy was out of bounds.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.545
The law is hard
but it's the law.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.280
Even I forget
that sometimes.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.315
So, you're just
gonna let her send
Jace out instead of you?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.735
[grunting]

13:06.736 --> 13:09.154
If I screw up,
I expect to be punished.
I'm supposed to be a leader.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.722
[grunts]

13:12.125 --> 13:14.559
You know what
a leader does, Alec?
Makes decisions.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.694
You need to find
Valentine and stop him.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.164
I need to find Valentine
and help save my mother.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.965
[grunting]

13:27.641 --> 13:29.641
[groaning and panting]

13:30.677 --> 13:32.477
You need to work
on your defense.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.078
[Clary chuckles]
What do you think?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.315
Do you think we
haven't been trying
to find your mother?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.583
Of course you have.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.251
But I know you can
color outside the lines.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.686
You're just not
letting yourself
think that way.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.155
Oh, yeah? What's the big
thought I'm not thinking?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.690
We can still find Valentine.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.727
I might know a way.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.929
[sighs] My mother
hid a lot from me,
but I did see one thing...

13:50.931 --> 13:52.764
there's a box.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.766
She didn't think
I knew about it.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.734
But she opened it
once a year and cried.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.770
'Cause?

13:58.772 --> 14:00.104
It belonged to my father.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.907
Had his initials,
JC, on top.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.544
But your father's
Valentine. Why JC?

14:06.546 --> 14:09.881
Because for 18 years,
she told me his name
was Jonathan Clark.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.049
That was a lie. But...

14:11.051 --> 14:13.051
[inhaling]
whatever was in that box

14:13.053 --> 14:14.619
meant a lot to her.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.688
Maybe there's something inside
that could help us track him.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.756
Where can we find the box?

14:19.693 --> 14:20.959
I think it's still
back at the loft.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.294
Let's go get it.
[phone ringing]

14:23.296 --> 14:25.530
Absolutely not.
Not without permission.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.733
[scoffs]

14:28.735 --> 14:30.034
Just...

14:32.806 --> 14:34.072
Hello?
Who is this?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.474
Alexander. Hi.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.209
It's Magnus.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.546
We met the other day.
You know, with the demon.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.749
Uh, yeah...
Yeah, hey, what's up?

14:44.751 --> 14:48.319
I was just thinking
it was really nice
getting to know you.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.955
You seem... sympathetic.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.659
Would you like to go out
for a drink some time?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.696
That sounds fun, um...

14:58.698 --> 14:59.898
When?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.667
How about right now?
Um...

15:04.604 --> 15:06.104
You know,
now's not a really
good time for me.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.439
Another time? Gotta go.
[phone beeps]

15:10.010 --> 15:12.510
Playing hard to get.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.245
I love a challenge.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.320
[panting]

15:45.312 --> 15:46.611
You're late.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.382
Beer.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.425
[electricity crackling]

16:00.427 --> 16:02.860
[Theo] You know
the difference between
the Circle and the Clave?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.563
I don't.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.332
They all lock the same to me.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.402
Shadowhunters think
they're better than us.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.638
They're the ones
killing each other
over petty disagreements.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.343
Is that who you trust
with the Mortal Cup?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.612
They expect us to obey orders
they don't follow themselves.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.414
I'm sick of it.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.084
Yeah, maybe we don't
have angel blood.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.485
We got each other.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.422
We're a family.
A pack.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.091
We're stronger
than they'll ever be.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.326
I say, we take
the Cup for ourselves.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.031
This girl knows
where the Cup is.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.400
Find her.
Bring her to me.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.451
[phone ringing]

17:07.894 --> 17:09.394
[Alec] Why'd you run out?

17:09.396 --> 17:10.995
And what's the point
of an Invisibility rune

17:10.997 --> 17:13.064
if you don't
silence your phone?

17:13.066 --> 17:15.066
That was childish,
sneaking out like that...

17:15.068 --> 17:18.136
Simon. Hey.
I know I should have
called you right back.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.737
I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?

17:19.739 --> 17:22.340
[groans] You know that thing
when you think
you're catching a cold,

17:22.342 --> 17:23.975
but you never
actually get sick?

17:23.977 --> 17:25.977
<i> Yeah, I totally get it.</i>

17:25.978 --> 17:27.978
Um, can we talk later?
Things are kind of
insane right now.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.648
<i> Insane, how?</i>
<i> Are you okay?</i>

17:30.649 --> 17:33.316
I... I kind of
killed a demon and lost
all my memories forever. So...

17:33.319 --> 17:34.585
You killed a what?

17:34.587 --> 17:36.320
Okay, Clary, where are you?

17:36.322 --> 17:37.822
<i> I'm at the Brooklyn Academy.</i>

17:37.824 --> 17:38.990
I'm on my way to--
Hang up.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.658
That's it, we have to go.
Right now.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.260
No. I'm on my way
to the loft.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.562
There's something there
that I think could
help me find my mother.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.364
Are you crazy?

17:46.365 --> 17:48.165
That's way too dangerous.
You think nobody's
watching that place?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.667
I'm fine.
I'm with Alec.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.103
And those words
are supposed to
make me feel better how?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.771
<i>Yeah, I'm coming to help.</i>

17:53.773 --> 17:55.907
No, Simon, you've been
through enough already.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.809
So have you.
Meet me at the old shortcut.
You know the one.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.681
Mundanes. Look at them.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.149
Running around like ants.

18:05.885 --> 18:06.951
Let's go.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.286
Why do you always
look so miserable?

18:09.689 --> 18:10.955
I don't.
You do.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.024
It must be hard
being in love with Jace

18:13.026 --> 18:14.759
and he's straight
and everything.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.296
Excuse me? What?

18:18.298 --> 18:19.697
[chuckling]
What's the big deal?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.233
I was there when
that memory came out.
Busted, no?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.734
We're    <i> parabatai.</i>

18:23.736 --> 18:26.471
Alec, just say it,
you'll feel better.
You're in love with Jace.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.440
Forget it. You know what?
You're in love with Jace.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.609
Oh, okay?
The middle school comeback?
Nice.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.779
Alec, we have a real problem
to solve, okay?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.280
Come with me.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.617
This better be quick.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.956
[birds chirping]

18:45.892 --> 18:48.292
We mourn those in
the path of souls.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.894
[bells chiming]

18:50.797 --> 18:52.063
[exhales]

19:04.744 --> 19:06.043
Isabelle.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.082
I see you brought a friend.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.650
More like a brother.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.819
Jace Wayland.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.655
Here to deliver a message?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.824
Here to ask questions.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.994
So you do
want something.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.496
Nice to know that
some things never change.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.599
But the information we want
will cost you nothing.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.869
Sometimes knowledge
is the most
precious thing of all.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.671
Ask away.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.840
We can discuss
the price later.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.942
[chuckling]

19:40.780 --> 19:42.647
[Valentine]
Medicine has failed you.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.715
Humankind has failed you.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.852
[speaking Russian]

19:55.628 --> 19:57.261
[speaking English]
An improved life.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.198
May the bravest of you
step forward.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.867
Take the mark of the angels

20:02.869 --> 20:06.137
and live a life
with a future again.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.544
[grunts]

20:18.985 --> 20:20.384
[chuckles softly]

20:23.723 --> 20:25.723
[flesh searing]
[screaming]

20:31.331 --> 20:32.597
And now the Seelie blood.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.300
You shall be
more than Forsaken.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.940
[speaking Russian]

20:52.685 --> 20:54.485
[groaning]

20:58.258 --> 20:59.991
[speaking English]
If he is worthy,
he will live.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.696
He will live in
the glory of angels.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.609
Hey, you.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.977
Oh, thanks for being here.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.680
You don't need
to do this alone.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.916
It's not who we are.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.319
Are you sure you're
feeling up to this?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.454
Yeah, it's just a cold.
Not the end of the world.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.989
The world's been ending
for a thousand years.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.125
Ah, you get used to it.
Now, we need to move.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.160
Yeah, my mom's loft
is just across the alley.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.728
All right, well,
we have to be careful.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.963
There are eyes
all over this place

21:38.965 --> 21:40.564
and everybody in
the Shadow World's
looking for you.

21:40.566 --> 21:43.567
I mean, I guarantee you,
no one's gonna
find this shortcut.

21:43.569 --> 21:46.070
I used to take it
back in middle school
to see Clary.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.073
You might know
the Shadow World,
but trust me...

21:49.075 --> 21:50.574
I know Brooklyn.
Come on.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.513
[scoffs]

22:04.924 --> 22:07.058
[Clary] Have you been doing
parkour or something?

22:18.671 --> 22:20.204
You've gotten
a lot better at this.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.373
I was just gonna say
the same thing about you.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.110
Climbing a fire escape
excites mundanes.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.945
I'll never understand
these people.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.182
Whoa!

22:31.851 --> 22:33.751
I don't remember
it like this.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.455
These are runes and
wards of protection
cast by a warlock.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.690
Dot.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.626
Some of these have
been here for years.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.963
The only difference is now
I can actually see them.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.898
[Simon] Yo, Clary.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.367
What are all these tags?

22:49.369 --> 22:51.001
You can see the runes?

22:51.003 --> 22:53.337
Yeah, kind of hard to miss.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.339
For a Shadowhunter.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.575
They should be invisible
to most mundanes.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.076
When did you
get the Sight?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.629
[chuckling] I don't know.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.380
But whoever drew these should
take some lessons from Clary.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.883
Their, uh, work
is pretty sloppy.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.653
This is from when Simon and I
were engaged to be married.

23:09.655 --> 23:11.222
[Alec] You were engaged?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.557
I'm almost certain
I don't wanna
hear this story--

23:13.559 --> 23:14.892
We were eight years old.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.395
That was a whole
other world ago.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.504
[clattering]
[grunting]

23:28.207 --> 23:29.707
[sighs]

23:29.709 --> 23:31.509
There's only one flaw
in your plan here, Simon.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.977
Here, let me try.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.148
[clanging]

23:39.018 --> 23:40.684
After you.

23:40.686 --> 23:41.986
Okay.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.190
Ooh. After me.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.867
Holy crap, Clary.
Who torched your loft?

23:57.737 --> 23:59.336
Yeah, I can
see this, too.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.110
Hey.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.279
You okay?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.615
There's nothing
left of me here.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.618
[sighs]

24:16.289 --> 24:18.222
Of course, there isn't.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.258
Your mother was trying
to erase any trace
that you existed.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.927
So that you
couldn't be tracked.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.762
She was protecting you.
[floorboard creaking]

24:24.764 --> 24:26.330
Let's see how well
that worked.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.832
[Alec] You're alive,
aren't you?

24:27.834 --> 24:29.233
[creaking]

24:31.304 --> 24:32.903
These floorboards...

24:36.409 --> 24:38.075
They sound different
in these two spots.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.513
Can't you hear it?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.450
There's something under here.

24:46.452 --> 24:47.852
[creaking]

24:58.364 --> 25:00.097
Another score for Brooklyn.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.233
Hey, out of the way.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.435
You're welcome.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.577
[Alec] There's
something down here.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.083
Is this the box you remember?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.519
Yeah.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.622
She used to wait till she
thought I was asleep
and then take it out.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.392
Well, let's open it.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.401
I don't know
what any of this is.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.271
[shattering]

25:43.142 --> 25:44.408
There's someone here.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.311
Get what you need.
Do not move
until I get back.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.812
We've been here too long.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.091
[growling]
[rustling]

26:20.012 --> 26:21.579
[growling]

26:24.116 --> 26:25.482
[rustling]

26:30.756 --> 26:32.022
[snarling]

26:36.696 --> 26:39.430
[Simon grunting]
Let go. Seriously, Alaric.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.251
Is it true that your
queen has broken off
communications with the Clave?

27:01.253 --> 27:02.620
You've heard that's the case?

27:02.622 --> 27:03.821
Yes.

27:03.823 --> 27:07.725
Does it have anything
to do with the scouts you
sent out after Valentine?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.693
Is there another reason
you can think of?

27:10.496 --> 27:12.529
Butterflies can
mean only one thing...

27:14.600 --> 27:16.900
Fair Folk are in mourning.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.002
How do you know our customs?

27:18.004 --> 27:22.640
Apparently, I'm not the only
Shadowhunter who enjoys
the company of a Fair Folk.

27:23.909 --> 27:26.844
Maybe if more Shadowhunters
exhibited such good taste

27:26.846 --> 27:28.812
things would be
different today.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.681
[Jace] The scouts are dead.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.284
That's who you're mourning.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.686
Valentine
killed them, right?

27:35.688 --> 27:38.689
If you know so much,
maybe I should be asking you.

27:38.691 --> 27:41.558
If that's true, Valentine
needs to be stopped.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.827
Don't you agree?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.963
Why break the Accords now
when there's a threat?

27:45.965 --> 27:47.965
Perhaps the Accords
don't provide

27:47.967 --> 27:50.801
equal protection
for all Shadow Realms.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.704
Perhaps all threats don't
affect all of us the same way.

27:53.706 --> 27:56.240
Valentine
threatens everyone.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.045
Those who antagonize an enemy
stand to lose more.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.947
Which is another way
of saying you'll side
with whoever wins.

28:05.618 --> 28:07.851
I promise you,
that will be us.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.422
I'm sure you believe that.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.125
[phone chiming]

28:17.663 --> 28:18.962
Damn it, Alec.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.297
What?

28:20.299 --> 28:22.533
Clary snuck out
of the Institute.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.501
And yet you're
blaming our brother?

28:24.503 --> 28:25.903
Fascinating.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.149
Where is she?
Where's Clary?

28:39.151 --> 28:40.384
She's gone.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.685
What do you mean, gone?

28:41.687 --> 28:44.655
She and Simon got arrested
when I was
securing the fire escape.

28:44.657 --> 28:46.056
[stuttering]
I got distracted.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.758
The mundane was here?
[Isabelle] Simon?

28:47.760 --> 28:49.093
He's gone, too?

28:49.095 --> 28:51.862
It was an unmarked car.
I don't know
where they took her.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.831
What did you do, Alec?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.667
[breathes heavily]

29:13.919 --> 29:16.453
[Clary] Where are we?
This isn't the police station.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.088
Just cooperate and
everything will be fine.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.189
Get out!

29:20.126 --> 29:22.359
[Clary grunts]
We didn't do anything wrong.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.395
Be quiet or you're
gonna make this
worse for yourself.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.463
[phone ringing]
Hey, you're not a cop!

29:27.466 --> 29:28.599
Alaric, who is this guy?

29:28.601 --> 29:29.867
Luke's calling.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.702
Ignore it. That's an order.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.803
Are you guys with Luke?

29:32.805 --> 29:34.338
Did he send you?
None of your business.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.944
[breathing deeply]

29:45.117 --> 29:46.517
Damn it. [panting]

29:47.386 --> 29:49.419
She's not showing up.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.455
need to    <i> parabatai    </i> track.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.140
Alec, concentrate.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.483
Alec!

30:19.485 --> 30:22.252
I'm doing it.
She's not showing up.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.320
[phone chimes]

30:23.322 --> 30:25.355
Just like I thought.
She wasn't arrested.

30:27.626 --> 30:28.959
It was your job
to look after her.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.127
I did my best, Jace.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.261
Then maybe your
mother was right,

30:31.263 --> 30:32.462
and your best is
just isn't good enough.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.248
Jace!
Hey!

30:34.249 --> 30:36.033
Are you so blinded by
your feelings for Clary,
you've lost sight of us?

30:39.605 --> 30:40.671
Clary snuck out.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.441
I went after her...
to protect her.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.543
I did nothing
you haven't done
a thousand times before.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.046
Yes, you did.
You lost her.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.215
Enough, both of you.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.289
Why do I keep
getting kidnapped?

30:59.290 --> 31:01.023
Not to be self-centered,
but I think it's
me they're after.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.126
[both grunt]

31:07.366 --> 31:08.699
Okay, what is going on?

31:08.701 --> 31:11.134
Alaric, did you
arrest us for trespassing

31:11.136 --> 31:12.336
or something,
because, news flash,

31:12.338 --> 31:13.637
I was in my own apartment.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.572
We're just having
a little conversation,
that's all.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.574
Do you always handcuff people
you wanna talk to?

31:17.576 --> 31:19.877
I bet this guy has
one of the scariest
online profiles ever.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.046
This guy's funny.
I like funny.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.182
Look, I know
you're scared of Luke.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.184
He's trying to find you,
I can keep you safe.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.419
You just need to tell us
where the Mortal Cup is.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.990
Everyone thinks I
can find this Cup,
but I don't know where it is!

31:32.992 --> 31:35.525
Think, Clary. I'm trying
to give you a chance.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.594
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.896
Now, will you
please let us go?

31:39.365 --> 31:40.664
Playtime's over.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.000
Theo, just let me talk
some sense into them.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.502
No, we did it your way.
Now, we're gonna
try it my way.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.004
What?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.772
Hey, hey--
Hey, don't touch him!

31:48.774 --> 31:52.242
Don't move.
Tell us where the Cup is
or your funny friend dies.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.880
[gasps] Please, please...
Please,
don't hurt Simon, okay?

31:56.882 --> 31:59.950
[stammers] I promise you,
I swear to you,
I do not where this Cup is.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.752
That's too bad.
Get rid of him.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.054
What? Hey, let go of me!
Simon!

32:04.056 --> 32:06.857
Get your hands off me! Clary!
Please, wait, don't hurt him.

32:06.859 --> 32:09.226
No!
Clary!

32:09.228 --> 32:13.163
Please, wait!
Simon... no!

32:17.436 --> 32:18.702
[shuddering]

32:20.139 --> 32:22.039
Please, tell me
if Simon's okay.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.342
He's alive... for now.
[sighs]

32:26.779 --> 32:27.945
Thank God.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.713
You can thank
whoever you want.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.215
But if you don't tell us
where the Cup is...

32:32.217 --> 32:34.217
we're gonna
introduce Gretel here
to your friend.

32:34.219 --> 32:35.552
[growling]

32:35.554 --> 32:37.387
She's one of our
fiercest warriors.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.822
[growling]

32:38.824 --> 32:40.324
She'll rip him
to shreds.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.729
[gasping]
You're werewolves.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.164
[Theo] Obviously.

32:48.934 --> 32:52.436
And your friend is dog meat
if you don't give us the Cup.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.305
[growling]

32:56.141 --> 32:57.975
[Clary shuddering]

33:02.081 --> 33:04.848
Okay! Okay...

33:04.850 --> 33:05.916
You win.

33:06.919 --> 33:09.119
I'll tell you where
the Cup is, just...

33:09.121 --> 33:10.721
Just please, let Simon go.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.223
I'm listening.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.293
It's, uh...

33:16.295 --> 33:18.495
It's in the loft
where you found me.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.597
There's a loose floorboard
in the bedroom.

33:21.934 --> 33:24.368
My mom didn't know I knew,
but she hid it there.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.173
Bring me the Cup.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.779
If you're lying...

33:36.615 --> 33:38.348
I'm not just gonna
kill your friend...

33:38.851 --> 33:40.851
I'm gonna make you watch

33:40.853 --> 33:42.652
as Gretel
rips him to shreds.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.888
[snarling]

33:45.791 --> 33:48.458
This... again?

33:51.663 --> 33:52.863
[grunting] Again?

33:56.335 --> 33:57.701
[Simon straining]
[clattering]

33:57.703 --> 33:59.636
Whoa! [panting]

34:14.653 --> 34:16.453
[straining]

34:23.395 --> 34:24.995
Lighter...

34:30.002 --> 34:32.035
[phone beeps]
Who do I... Wait.

34:32.037 --> 34:34.871
Who do I call? Simon, think.
Who do you call?

34:34.873 --> 34:38.175
Whoever took Clary and Simon
must be holding them
over a body of water.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.544
That's why our
Tracking rune
won't work.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.012
[phone ringing]

34:42.014 --> 34:43.280
Clary left her phone
in her backpack.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.854
[phone beeps]
Hello?

34:50.856 --> 34:53.924
[panting] Oh, I thought
I'd never utter these words,
but thank God it's you.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.225
It's me, Simon.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.526
Where are you?
Where's Clary?

34:56.528 --> 34:59.596
I don't know.
Some Chinese restaurant,
I think?

34:59.598 --> 35:02.732
<i>This cop Alaric arrested us,</i>
<i>but it was a total fake-out.</i>

35:02.734 --> 35:04.101
<i> Him and his buddy,</i>
<i> they took us...</i>

35:04.103 --> 35:05.535
They us to their hangout
and then they told Clary

35:05.537 --> 35:06.937
that they'll kill her
if they don't find the Cup.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.372
Just calm down, all right?
Tell us what you see.

35:09.374 --> 35:12.042
Okay. Uh...

35:12.044 --> 35:14.578
Uh, we're definitely
on a pier.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.946
<i>There's a ton of water. Uh...</i>

35:15.948 --> 35:17.681
<i> I see lockers and...</i>

35:18.784 --> 35:19.850
[muttering] Oh, my...

35:20.886 --> 35:22.586
I'm in some sort
of torture chamber.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.254
<i> There's claw marks</i>
<i> all over the wall.</i>

35:24.256 --> 35:25.722
Werewolves.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.957
That's possible.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.226
Okay, Simon,

35:29.228 --> 35:31.561
you need to get more specific.
Tell us what you see.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.662
<i> Help us find you.</i>

35:32.664 --> 35:34.731
There's nothing else
that can help--

35:34.733 --> 35:35.799
Wait, hold on! Hold on.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.200
[panting]

35:38.070 --> 35:40.737
I'm at the Jade Wolf
Chinese Restaurant
on the pier at Greene St.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.906
And they have really
inexpensive cocktails.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.174
Just hurry, just hurry.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.575
You need to
create a diversion.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.743
Stall them.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.579
How? All I have are
clothes and a lighter.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.515
[Jace]    <i> Start a fire, Simon.</i>
That never works!

35:51.517 --> 35:52.983
Have you ever
seen an action movie?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.085
<i> We're on our way.</i>
[phone beeps]

35:55.087 --> 35:56.720
[breathing heavily]

36:05.797 --> 36:07.364
What's taking
them so long?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.607
[alarm ringing]

36:17.609 --> 36:18.775
[air hissing]

36:18.777 --> 36:20.944
It's a fire.
Find it!

36:20.946 --> 36:22.946
I'll take care
of the girl. Go.

36:25.117 --> 36:27.217
[Clary grunting]
Would you let me go?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.221
Where's Simon?

36:31.223 --> 36:32.455
[Theo] Get in there.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.192
[grunting]
Keep your mouth shut!

36:52.044 --> 36:53.109
[searing]

36:57.249 --> 36:58.548
[gasping]

37:03.488 --> 37:04.788
[Clary gasping]

37:07.159 --> 37:08.658
I finally found you, Clary.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.898
[Luke] Clary, Clary!

37:15.834 --> 37:17.167
You stay away from me!

37:17.169 --> 37:19.036
Don't be afraid.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.904
I traced Alaric's car
to the pier when
he didn't return my calls.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.505
I'm here to help you.
Oh, really?

37:22.507 --> 37:24.274
I heard what you
said at the precinct.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.776
You told those creeps
the last 18 years of
your life were a lie.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.678
Those were
Valentine's people.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.313
I lied to them
to protect you.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.582
Don't come any closer.

37:33.185 --> 37:35.218
You want the Mortal Cup,
just like everyone else.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.720
You know
you can't cast spells
with that thing?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.623
Yeah, but I already stabbed
one demon with it.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.391
I'm sure it hurts
a lot worse on a man.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.026
Hey!

37:43.028 --> 37:44.594
You need more training.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.563
And we gotta go.
Now!

37:46.565 --> 37:48.398
[Clary] What? Hey!

37:48.400 --> 37:50.267
[grunting]

37:50.269 --> 37:51.701
Where are you taking me?

37:51.703 --> 37:53.220
Someplace safe.

37:53.221 --> 37:54.738
These people
aren't messing around.
They will kill you.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.539
[Jace] Alec!
[Alec] Got her.

37:56.541 --> 37:57.707
[Jace] Put her down!

37:57.709 --> 37:58.808
[Luke groaning]

38:03.615 --> 38:05.382
You okay?
I will be.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.950
As soon as
we find Simon.
Come on.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.854
[alarm ringing]
[wheezing]

38:22.301 --> 38:25.402
I'm getting seriously tired
of saving your life.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.070
I am not!

38:30.676 --> 38:32.742
[Simon] Clary!
Simon!

38:32.744 --> 38:34.411
Oh, my God.
[Simon] Are you okay?

38:34.413 --> 38:35.578
[Clary] I was so worried.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.980
I hate to break up
this little reunion,

38:36.982 --> 38:38.815
but we got a bunch of
werewolves trying to kill us

38:38.817 --> 38:40.467
so maybe we
should get going--

38:40.468 --> 38:42.118
Wait, wait, the box.
My backpack. I think
I left it at the loft.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.620
No, we've got it.
I didn't
screw up everything.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.022
Let's get out
of here, then.
Wait, Simon!

38:46.024 --> 38:48.692
Whatever you do,
do not make any fast moves.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.393
[werewolves growling]

38:53.098 --> 38:54.431
This can't be good.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.308
[Alec] We're surrounded.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.509
[growling]

39:09.114 --> 39:10.613
Everyone,
stay together.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.515
Believe me, I'm not
going anywhere.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.420
Everyone, get back,
that's the alpha leader.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.191
Jace, behind!
[howling]

39:24.963 --> 39:26.129
[both snarling]

39:35.874 --> 39:37.207
He's challenging the alpha.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.475
He's helping us!

39:38.477 --> 39:40.143
Or cutting in line
to kill us.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.146
[werewolf whimpering]

39:49.821 --> 39:51.621
[Isabelle] The alpha's dead.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.630
[grunts]

40:02.501 --> 40:04.067
Oh, my God, Luke.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.902
[werewolves howling]

40:09.107 --> 40:10.306
What?

40:13.278 --> 40:15.111
[panting]

40:17.716 --> 40:19.182
What is it?
What's happening?

40:20.786 --> 40:23.453
When a werewolf
kills the alpha leader,
he becomes the new alpha.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.956
Your friend Luke's
the leader of the pack now.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.293
[sighs]

40:32.464 --> 40:33.596
Clary...

40:36.568 --> 40:38.668
No.
It's okay.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.009
I promised your mother
I'd always protect you.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.680
Luke! Oh, my God!

40:51.883 --> 40:53.716
Hey...

40:53.718 --> 40:55.385
we need to get Clary
back to the Institute

40:55.387 --> 40:56.653
and stay out of
Downworlder business.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.289
Why don't you stay out of it?
I'm going to help Clary.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.625
We have to report
back to our mother.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.060
You and Isabelle can do that.

41:04.830 --> 41:05.962
[Simon] Luke...

41:05.964 --> 41:07.230
I'll be fine on my own.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.069
His wounds are deep.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.339
Only a warlock's magic
can cure an alpha's bite.

41:16.341 --> 41:17.974
We have to
get him to Magnus.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.143
Hey, that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.845
[Luke grunting]

41:22.981 --> 41:24.414
[Simon] Clary,
we gotta go.

41:24.416 --> 41:25.682
We have to
get him to his car.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.050
[Luke groaning softly]

41:28.153 --> 41:30.086
[Simon] Here, I'll drive.
I got you.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.155
I'm the only one
with a mundane license.
Come on.

41:38.430 --> 41:39.996
Are you two okay?

41:41.333 --> 41:42.699
I don't know.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.637

We never should

It's okay.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.456
Just, please,
