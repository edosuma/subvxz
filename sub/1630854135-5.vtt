00:14.666 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:50.702
<i>Who's Frank Donnelly?</i>

00:52.965 --> 00:54.489
A friend.

00:54.489 --> 00:57.057
<i>He was a friend.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:59.755
And a cop.
A very good cop.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.193
<i>And a corrupt one.</i>

01:03.193 --> 01:04.803
And he killed himself...

01:04.803 --> 01:07.110
Broke my heart, pal.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.808
<i>Frank!</i>

01:13.464 --> 01:15.684
<i>Leaving behind a wife
and a little baby.</i>

01:15.684 --> 01:19.079
Frank Elliot Jr.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.385
How you like that?

01:21.385 --> 01:25.476
And I feel responsible
in some way.

01:25.476 --> 01:26.956
Stabler's undercover.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.437
<i>Prick's gonna burn us all.</i>

01:29.437 --> 01:32.657
And that's why
they gave you the medal.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.791
Yeah.

02:07.692 --> 02:08.867
Father Lin.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.173
I'm sorry.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.479
I wanted proof
you were actually here

02:11.479 --> 02:13.176
in case, you know,
He asks me later.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.699
Ah, come on.
It hasn't been that long.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.441
- How old's my niece?
- Ten.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.442
I don't have a niece.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.965
I have a nephew.
- Nephew. Chris.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.011
- He's 15.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.274
All right.
Point made.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.972
Big day today?

02:26.972 --> 02:28.191
Yeah.
Why do you ask?

02:28.191 --> 02:29.453
Twitter.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.976
You and the Brotherhood
are trending.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.979
Yeah, I guess I was just
asking for a little backup.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.112
You know you don't have
to bribe Him to get backup.

02:36.112 --> 02:39.594
Well, it's New York City.
You know, a bribe never hurts.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.901
Anything you want
to get off your chest?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.947
Plenty, but not today.
Not here, not now.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.340
But I appreciate it, Father.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.342
God be with you.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.433
Always is.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.699
Detective Elliot Stabler
has just given his testimony

02:57.699 --> 03:01.311
in the long-awaited
Brotherhood corruption trial.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.008
Stabler,
a decorated detective,

03:03.008 --> 03:06.229
was embedded with a unit
of dirty cops in the 37th.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.797
Officers were
both cops and robbers.

03:08.797 --> 03:09.798
Get out of here!

03:09.798 --> 03:10.886
Detective,
how did it feel

03:10.886 --> 03:12.409
to testify
against your fellow cops?

03:12.409 --> 03:13.845
Stabler,
with your track record,

03:13.845 --> 03:16.021
who are you to pass judgment
on other cops?

03:16.021 --> 03:20.722
Who am I?
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.986
I had to take an oath
in order to get this job.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.118
And every day,
I wake up,

03:26.118 --> 03:29.557
and I try to honor that promise
that I made to this city...

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
You don't know what honor is!

03:31.428 --> 03:33.909
My coworkers,
and the people who live here.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.302
That's who I am.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.868
Do you think justice
was done today, Detective?

03:40.611 --> 03:42.787
NYPD! Open up!

03:48.271 --> 03:49.316
Who you looking for?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.233
Don't move!
On the ground!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.364
What the hell are you doing?

03:54.364 --> 03:55.800
I'm already on the ground!

03:57.062 --> 03:58.542
- Let me see your hands!
- Okay, okay, okay!

03:58.542 --> 04:00.718
- All clear.
- Stay on that damn couch!

04:00.718 --> 04:03.199
- Don't be stupid!
- You, did I tell you to move?

04:03.199 --> 04:04.331
Hit it.

04:11.338 --> 04:14.558
Bingo.
- Just like I thought.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.604
Let's get this in the car.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.406
Please.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.584
No! No!

04:40.584 --> 04:42.325
Come with us.
Come with us.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.587
Leave them alone!

04:43.587 --> 04:45.328
I told you to stay back.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.462
Get in.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.768
Come on.
Come on.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.117
No! No!

04:52.117 --> 04:53.467
- Get up!
- Get over there!

05:44.779 --> 05:46.650
- Rollins, hey.
- Hey.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.565
Liv said it'd be all right
to give you a call.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.567
Of course, anytime.
How's the captain doing?

05:50.567 --> 05:52.482
- She's good.
- All right, good.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.962
So you got two vics?
- Yeah.

05:53.962 --> 05:57.400
A mother and her teenage
daughter, they were assaulted.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.706
And?

05:58.706 --> 06:02.666
And--well,
we don't have a lot to go on.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.015
They're both keeping quiet,

06:04.015 --> 06:06.104
and neither one of them
consented to a rape kit.

06:06.104 --> 06:09.238
You think
they're covering for someone?

06:09.238 --> 06:10.282
Rollins, why am I here?

06:10.282 --> 06:12.110
They're saying cops did it.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.766
Oh.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.507
The mom says
that officers showed up,

06:17.507 --> 06:18.856
started smashing walls,

06:18.856 --> 06:21.381
and raped her and her daughter
in a back room.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.561
NYPD?

06:27.561 --> 06:29.084
- Just like the Brotherhood.
- No.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.565
Rape was never part
of the Brotherhood's MO.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.305
You know, they were
about the money, getting paid.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.481
Right,
but then they got busted,

06:34.481 --> 06:35.743
so maybe they're
about something else now,

06:35.743 --> 06:37.397
like sending a message?

06:42.097 --> 06:43.490
To who? Me?

06:49.321 --> 06:50.540
How old's the daughter?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.194
She's 16.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.936
Her name's Jazmin.
Her mother's Maria.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.214
Hi, Maria.
I'm Elliot.

07:15.957 --> 07:19.482
Detective Rollins has
told me what happened.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.267
Police officers did this.

07:22.267 --> 07:26.663
And this was who I was
telling you about, my friend.

07:26.663 --> 07:29.753
He polices the police.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.973
Can I talk with you?

07:35.498 --> 07:38.675
They wore masks.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.112
They didn't have badges
on their uniforms.

07:43.637 --> 07:48.729
Do you remember
any physical details?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.473
Names, hair color?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.563
Anything will help.

07:56.563 --> 08:00.349
I tried to save my daughter,

08:00.349 --> 08:02.482
but they beat me.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.005
They made me watch.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.536
Maria, I'm gonna
make a promise to you.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.974
I'm gonna do everything in
my power to find these people,

08:16.974 --> 08:20.064
but I need to know
where this happened.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.196
I need an address.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.896
Maria, the only people
you're helping now

08:25.896 --> 08:29.117
are the ones who hurt you.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.292
Help us find them.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.427
So we can punish them.

08:35.427 --> 08:38.909
Only God can punish them.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.216
So help me be His backup.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.526
Let me take
this investigation

08:46.526 --> 08:48.136
to the next level.

08:48.136 --> 08:51.095
You know as well as I do
what the eighth floor will say.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.836
OK, convince them.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.186
Look, you caught
Henry Cole's killer

08:55.186 --> 08:58.146
and took a crooked union head
out of the casino belt.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.495
Take the win.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.671
Parlay it into a better
position for yourself,

09:01.671 --> 09:02.846
one with less time
on the street

09:02.846 --> 09:05.196
and more time with Jack.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.242
But what about OCCB?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.853
This task force was created
to take down Richard Wheatley.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.247
You've done that
and a lot more.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.989
End on a high note.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.686
Wait, end?

09:16.686 --> 09:18.383
It's time for everyone
to move on.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.952
Besides, after that circus
at the courthouse yesterday,

09:21.952 --> 09:24.302
Stabler is not a good alliance
for you anymore.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.217
Stabler is my friend.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.916
He's the best damn detective
I have ever worked with.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.788
I will not abandon him
for doing the right thing.

09:31.788 --> 09:36.097
Ayanna, I have your
best interests at heart.

09:36.097 --> 09:40.275
Trust me, it's time for you
to go to the next level.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.280
I'll put some feelers out
for you at 1PP.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.634
- Good morning.
- Is it?

09:51.634 --> 09:52.766
Hey, guys.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.898
Sarge in?
I need to talk to her.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.034
How long has she been here?
- You mean Cruella?

10:00.034 --> 10:01.122
Too long.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.255
Deputy Inspector Goldfarb.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.648
Detective Stabler.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.346
We'll talk soon.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.266
Anything about that
I need to know?

10:15.266 --> 10:16.616
Not yet.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.443
Any leads on the home invasion?

10:18.443 --> 10:20.358
Yeah, it's cops.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.838
And it's bad.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.453
- This the mom's house?
- Son.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.542
Son is the owner.
Gabriel Esparza.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.023
He's also the owner
of a pretty good rap sheet.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.721
Did time upstate
for drug dealing.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.331
Mom and daughter are
part of the operation?

10:36.331 --> 10:37.549
According to mom, no.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.681
Didn't know anything,
and I believe her.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.509
That should give us
some leverage.

10:40.509 --> 10:44.121
I'll do the talking.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.776
Hey, what was that earlier?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.473
Back at the office,
you were all jumpy.

10:48.473 --> 10:49.823
No, I wasn't.

10:49.823 --> 10:52.521
Jet, I'm a detective.
I notice these things.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.001
You were jumpy.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.916
Was it Bell?
You heard something?

10:55.916 --> 10:57.613
OK, now you're reaching.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.397
And you're lying.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.791
We'll take the front.
You guys take the back.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.102
Gabriel Esparza! NYPD!

11:11.496 --> 11:12.889
Elliot.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.848
Thought I heard something.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.765
Gabriel Esparza! Police!

11:21.811 --> 11:24.205
Gabriel! NYPD!

11:26.555 --> 11:27.904
Hey.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.645
You ain't coming
in my house again.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.168
OK, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.648
Listen to me.

11:32.648 --> 11:36.304
We're really the NYPD here.
We know what happened.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.262
We're here to help.
- Oh, yeah, like last time?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.307
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Put the weapon down!

11:39.307 --> 11:40.917
We just came
from the hospital.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.964
Maria and Jazmin.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.835
They're the ones
who sent us here.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.534
So let's--
let's drop the knife.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.014
Drop the knife.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.192
You're that cop
that busted those other cops.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.455
- That's right.
- Yeah, you're the rat.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.370
All right.
I don't care what you call me.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.678
Listen to me.
We're all gonna calm down.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.897
We're gonna talk.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.202
And you're gonna drop the knife

12:05.202 --> 12:06.726
or things are gonna
get really complicated.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.423
He means
I'm gonna shoot you.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.084
Man, you two
better not be lying to me.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.658
How many were there?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.051
I counted six.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.487
Anything stand out?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.056
Accents, tattoos?

12:33.056 --> 12:34.492
They were in uniforms
and had masks.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.624
I couldn't see nothing.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.756
Who could have
tipped them off?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.322
I'm not gonna tell you that.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.456
I start naming names,
I become a rat just like him.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.066
Found casings.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.199
Three different weapons.

12:45.199 --> 12:49.072
Silver jackets, armor
piercing rounds, and .45 ACPs.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.813
It's from a MAC-10.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.163
Yeah,
NYPD doesn't issue MAC-10s.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.513
OK, all right,
so we're done here guys.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.558
Let's go.
- Wait, hold up.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.081
You're leaving?
- Yeah.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.431
We're leaving because
you won't answer any questions.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.260
Now I got your mother and
your sister in the hospital.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.609
And you know
what happened to them

13:04.609 --> 13:05.741
and you know why they're there,

13:05.741 --> 13:06.960
but you want to do it your way?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.266
All right, good luck to you.
- The leader.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.399
He had these crazy blue eyes.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.838
You can track down someone
with crazy blue eyes, right?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.144
Oh, definitely.
Piece of cake.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.536
All right.
Thanks for your help.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.538
Word on the street,
he's straight up gangster.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.323
Runs with a crew of the same.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.541
Real killers.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.847
We need a name.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.327
If I had a name,
he'd already be dead.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.461
That's all I know.
Swear to God.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.246
For your sake,
I hope He's listening.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.248
Are we done?
- Yep.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.032
Let's track down
some gangsters

13:36.032 --> 13:38.339
who are posing as cops
before they hit again.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.306
There he is.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.568
Get in here.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.704
Come here! Aw!
- My man!

13:55.704 --> 13:57.793
Whoo! Yeah!
- Man.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.969
What's up, big dog?

13:59.969 --> 14:02.145
Damn, man.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.973
You've been hitting that iron
hard in there, huh?

14:03.973 --> 14:06.236
Yeah, man. Trying to get
swole like you, big bro.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.977
So how does it feel
to be the last Black man

14:07.977 --> 14:09.239
in jail for weed?

14:09.239 --> 14:10.806
Damn, man,
I'm trying to find out

14:10.806 --> 14:11.807
where the weed at now.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.156
Oh, you know I got you.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.418
No, we got each other.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.073
You ain't smoking nothing
in my new car.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.640
Check this out.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.990
- Hold on, this is you?
- This is us.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.514
God damn!

14:23.514 --> 14:25.125
Yo, Vaughn,
how'd you pull this off?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.996
Bro, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.998
Wait till you see the crib.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.086
Why?
What's at the crib?

14:30.086 --> 14:32.959
Get in.
I'll show you.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.830
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Get out of here, man.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.440
I'm going shotgun.
- You know what--

14:36.440 --> 14:38.181
- I've been in prison, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.661
- All right, bitch?
- Enjoy your time.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.097
That's my seat.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.712
One of our vics, Maria,
said they were gloved up.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.366
Wore masks, condoms,
and hairnets.

14:49.366 --> 14:52.413
- That takes planning.
- Yep.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.197
OK, what about these casings?

14:54.197 --> 14:56.678
MAC-10, that's not something
you see every day.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.767
So I clustered
all the gunfire reports

14:58.767 --> 15:01.465
from the last three months
and their follow-ups.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.425
Seven instances
reported MAC-10 casings.

15:04.425 --> 15:07.080
Cross-check that
with reported rapes.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.342
I already did.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.996
Three hospitals
reported admittance

15:09.996 --> 15:12.302
of sexual assault victims on
the same days as the shootings,

15:12.302 --> 15:14.565
nine in total.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.785
All nine refused
to identify their assailant.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
You know,
I can have a team from SVU

15:18.700 --> 15:21.659
create a grid, locations,
timelines, the works.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.009
I'll follow up
on the shootings.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.184
Maybe get Reyes on board.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.968
He's at court testifying

15:25.968 --> 15:27.709
against the inmate
that poked him.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.363
You give him a hand
with those

15:29.363 --> 15:31.669
MAC-10 shooting locations.
- Sure.

Come on in.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.310
Wow.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.746
Vaughn, like,
seriously, man,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.226
like, how did you
get all this stuff?

16:08.097 --> 16:09.881
Did you guys rob a bank?

16:11.361 --> 16:12.667
I'll show you.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.413
Oh, damn,
it's the cops!

16:22.720 --> 16:24.374
What--what's this?

16:24.374 --> 16:25.810
Hey, cops.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.683
Why don't you wave
to my boy, Dante, here?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.424
Sup, dude?
- Sup?

16:30.424 --> 16:34.428
This is my own division
of the NYPD.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.777
The Robin Hood.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.126
'Cause we be
robbing the hood.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.823
Yeah.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.784
We steal from the rich
and give to ourselves.

16:42.784 --> 16:47.136
So now you get
to join our band of...

16:47.136 --> 16:48.485
merry gangsters.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.052
I'm gonna call you
Lil' Jon.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.359
I'm Tuck.
Vaughn's King Richard.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.666
Vaughn, I don't know, man.
I mean, I just got out.

16:57.451 --> 17:01.368
Hey, I've been working hard
to put this operation together.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.674
Waiting for you to get out.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.115
Do you ever think
about what we went through?

17:09.115 --> 17:10.681
Hmm?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.683
Foster care with that bastard.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.079
No help from the cops.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.824
Well, now we got the power.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.523
So let's use it.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.231
NYPD.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.580
Want to talk about
the gunfire reported here

17:39.580 --> 17:40.581
a few nights ago.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.539
Gunfire?

17:42.539 --> 17:44.628
No, no,
that wasn't gunfire.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.239
Had the TV on too loud.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.936
Loud enough
you didn't notice the slugs

17:47.936 --> 17:49.068
coming through the windows?

17:54.029 --> 17:55.770
I don't think
he wants to talk.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.511
What gives you
that impression?

17:57.511 --> 18:00.035
We got six more.
Let's keep going.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.567
NYPD!

18:12.482 --> 18:15.094
Everyone on the ground now!

18:15.094 --> 18:16.878
Right, now you spread out.
- Yeah.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.227
Tell whoever is in there
the same thing.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.185
OK.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.144
All right,
get on the ground.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.146
More savage.
You're a cop, bruh.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.017
I said get your ass
on the ground!

18:26.017 --> 18:27.149
Yes! Yes!

18:27.149 --> 18:29.760
Now, once we're in,
you tear it up.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.892
It's all timing.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.155
Find the stash, get out.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.810
And if you shoot...

18:35.810 --> 18:38.378
shoot to kill.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.814
OK.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.905
All right,
let's go again.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.212
It feels good,
doesn't it?

18:46.212 --> 18:47.256
Whoo!

18:47.256 --> 18:49.606
Let's go.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.131
NYPD! Open up!

18:53.828 --> 18:55.743
On the floor now!

18:55.743 --> 18:57.919
Get down!
Get on the floor now!

18:57.919 --> 19:00.139
- Don't get up!
- Don't move.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.532
- Don't move!
- Sit down!

19:02.532 --> 19:04.752
I got 'em.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.972
Where's the stash, huh?

19:10.801 --> 19:14.414
Show me where it is,
or it only gets worse.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.068
It's in the wall over there.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.983
- Over here?
- Yeah.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.074
Hit it.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.169
Yeah.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.782
- We got it!
- There it is! There it is!

19:34.782 --> 19:36.958
There it is!
There it is! There it is!

19:36.958 --> 19:38.394
We got it.
We got it.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.094
This is getting too easy.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.313
Yes, sir.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.902
Jackpot.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.033
All right.
You ready?

20:15.823 --> 20:17.303
What's going on?

20:19.348 --> 20:24.092
No! No! No!

20:24.092 --> 20:25.136
No! No!

20:25.136 --> 20:26.399
No, stop!

20:26.399 --> 20:28.749
No, please!

20:28.749 --> 20:31.317
Please!

20:31.317 --> 20:32.666
No!

20:32.666 --> 20:34.885
Whoa!
Hey, hey!

20:35.843 --> 20:36.974
What are you doing?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.936
- No! No!
- Vaughn, what are you doing?

20:44.808 --> 20:49.857
You said my name.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.036
No!

20:55.036 --> 20:58.169
No, no!

20:58.169 --> 20:59.432
Yo! Hey, stop!

20:59.432 --> 21:01.303
What are you doing?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.653
Get off me!

21:09.920 --> 21:12.923
You see what you made me do?

21:22.498 --> 21:23.934
You see what you made me do?

21:33.161 --> 21:34.293
Come on, dude.
Come on.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.555
We got to go.
We got to go.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.774
- But he--
- Go! Go, go!

21:45.565 --> 21:46.827
Excuse us, please.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.700
It's the same MO.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.572
Shell casings everywhere.

21:52.572 --> 21:56.967
Silver jackets, hollow points,
even the ACPs from a MAC-10.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.926
What do we know about the vic?

21:58.926 --> 22:01.102
Tiana Samuels, 23.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.322
Sister of the homeowner,
Ramon Samuels.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.367
She was shot point blank.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.891
No sign of sexual assault.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.066
It doesn't fit the pattern.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.068
Yeah, point blank.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.418
That's personal.
- Yeah.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.854
Maybe she was trying
to fight back.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.334
We'll have to check
her nails for DNA.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.422
- Sergeant Bell.
- Yeah?

22:16.422 --> 22:17.640
Found this next to the body.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.077
- The vic's?
- I don't know.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.558
Maybe the brother knows.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.343
Come on.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.088
Ramon?

22:31.088 --> 22:33.482
I'm Sergeant Ayanna Bell, NYPD.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.226
Did they take her?

22:38.226 --> 22:40.141
Yeah.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.276
She didn't deserve that, man.
She was just a kid.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.848
Do you know if this belonged
to your sister?

22:59.813 --> 23:04.034
Look, I know that you
already gave your statement,

23:04.034 --> 23:07.821
but if there's anything else
you can remember...

23:09.649 --> 23:11.694
Did one of the men
have blue eyes?

23:13.740 --> 23:16.177
Yeah.

23:16.177 --> 23:19.136
The one that was in charge.

23:19.136 --> 23:22.444
He was a big guy
with blue eyes.

23:22.444 --> 23:26.230
He was the one
that grabbed my sister.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.755
Did you see anything,
hear anything?

23:28.755 --> 23:30.800
Anything that stood out?

23:30.800 --> 23:34.108
When I came to,

23:34.108 --> 23:38.068
one of the guys was yelling
at the big guy to stop.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.244
They started fighting.

23:40.244 --> 23:43.422
My sister,
she was screaming.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.904
I heard
the glass table shatter.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.910
And then came the shot that--

24:01.048 --> 24:02.353
Thank you, Ramon.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.573
I'm really sorry for your loss.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.712
What do you think?

24:12.712 --> 24:15.236
I think somebody tried
to stop the rape,

24:15.236 --> 24:17.238
which is
why it doesn't fit the pattern.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.110
Sergeant, found
another Christmas present.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.503
- What do we got?
- Glass.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.244
From the broken table upstairs.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.246
- Blood on it?
- Sure looks that way.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.511
If this is
from one of the crew,

24:29.511 --> 24:32.253
we just got
our first solid break.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.619
You want to say something?

24:50.619 --> 24:53.448
What was that last night?

24:53.448 --> 24:55.885
That girl did not deserve that.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.148
You shouldn't
have said my name.

24:58.148 --> 24:59.846
I did what had to be done.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.588
I'm talking before that, Vaughn.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.938
'Cause ain't nobody say
that was part of it.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.722
Sometimes it is.
Sometimes it isn't.

25:06.722 --> 25:09.464
Well,
I'm not down with it, OK?

25:09.464 --> 25:10.726
Uh-uh, I'm good.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.076
You don't get
to just walk away now.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.078
We're brothers, remember?

25:15.078 --> 25:17.167
Yeah, well, brothers
don't do this to each other.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.386
Yo, Dante, chill.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.344
No, no, no, Manny.
He needs to chill.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.565
You want out?

25:23.565 --> 25:25.436
You want to turn your back
on the one person

25:25.436 --> 25:27.438
who stood up for you
when you couldn't?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.399
Go ahead.

25:31.399 --> 25:32.705
Leave.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.762
I just hung up with Lillian.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.895
She's got questions.
- We're working on answers.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.462
We've got fake cops robbing,
raping, and now murder.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.986
Which makes us
front page news.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.814
- But the blood evidence--
- I told her.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.467
We're running it,
but she's impatient.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.600
- We all are.
- Labs are in.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.559
CODIS got a hit.
Manny Rivera.

26:02.473 --> 26:03.736
Rivera got a last known?

26:03.736 --> 26:06.347
Jamaica, Queens.
83rd and Chelsea.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.486
Hi.
Sergeant Ayanna Bell, NYPD.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.662
Detective Elliot Stabler.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.620
How are you today?
- Good, good.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.013
- Are you Leonard Baker?
- I am.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.319
Okay, you're listed
as the last known address

26:22.319 --> 26:23.843
for a Manny Rivera.

26:23.843 --> 26:24.844
Is he here?

26:27.498 --> 26:29.065
Those your kids?

26:29.065 --> 26:30.719
Those are my foster kids.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.677
Yeah.

26:33.896 --> 26:37.813
Manny was one too, but
I haven't seen him in years.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.641
What happened?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.469
So he did live here.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.340
Do you remember how long ago?

26:43.340 --> 26:46.605
Must have been, I don't know,
six, seven years ago.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.651
Have you had any contact
with him since then?

26:49.651 --> 26:51.610
Manny was a troubled kid.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.786
What kind of trouble?

26:53.786 --> 26:56.484
I don't like to speak badly
about a child in my care.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.486
I try to give them
every opportunity,

26:58.486 --> 27:00.706
but I have rules
that need to be followed.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.534
And Manny sadly
wasn't able to do that,

27:03.534 --> 27:06.102
so I had to send him away.

27:06.102 --> 27:09.453
And what does that mean?
You sent him where?

27:09.453 --> 27:11.455
Back in the system.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.893
I don't know
what happened after that.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.723
What kind of trouble is he in?

27:19.376 --> 27:21.857
If you hear from him, or if
you can think of anybody else

27:21.857 --> 27:24.164
who can put us in touch
with him, give us a call.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.687
Sure.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.950
Thank you.
Have a great day.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.869
- What you thinking?
- I think he's covering.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.698
Yeah, I'll get a warrant,
pull his file in ACS.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.788
You know, I was also
thinking about--what is it--

27:39.788 --> 27:43.270
50% of the people under 20,
they live their lives online.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.228
Let's get Jet on it
and see what she comes up with.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.577
Yeah.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.797
Standard F-boy content.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.452
He geotags location,
you know,

27:51.452 --> 27:52.714
"Look at me.
Look where I am."

27:52.714 --> 27:54.194
Check out his Story
for today.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.589
Hmm, Club Luxe.

27:58.589 --> 28:02.071
It's an underground speakeasy
at the 28th Street Station.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.291
- As in the subway station?
- Yeah, it's a thing.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.728
It's like the weirder
the location, the better.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.775
- I like my booze above ground.
- OK, boomer.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.777
Well, you'll see
who Manny rolls with tonight,

28:11.777 --> 28:14.257
'cause there's no way
he's going alone.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.650
Right, Gen Z?

28:18.392 --> 28:20.220
You know as well as I do

28:20.220 --> 28:22.178
that this could be a lot
for them to handle.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.138
I do, but Maria might
be stronger than you think.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.575
Not Maria
that I'm worried about.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.973
Take all the time you need.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.553
- He looks familiar.
- Familiar how?

28:51.338 --> 28:53.296
His eyes.

28:53.296 --> 28:56.604
OK, so let's just
keep looking so we're sure.

28:59.825 --> 29:03.002
It's just hard to tell.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.917
That's him.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.092
What?

29:06.092 --> 29:08.181
That's him.

29:12.707 --> 29:16.276
The one in the middle.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.191
He's the one who raped me.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.892
It's him.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.112
OK.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.766
Thank you, Jazmin.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.724
That's really helpful.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.956
Do you ever dance
when you go out?

29:43.956 --> 29:45.218
What?

29:45.218 --> 29:47.263
The other night,
when we actually had

29:47.263 --> 29:49.962
to look like we were having
a good time on the dance floor,

29:49.962 --> 29:51.267
I got the sense
you were more of a person

29:51.267 --> 29:54.096
who goes
and just watches people.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.319
Look, I'm just trying
to find a way in, that's all.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.234
And you seem,
I don't know,

30:01.234 --> 30:04.280
even more anxious lately.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.021
You're still new, OK?

30:06.021 --> 30:07.631
You don't get to make
those calls about me.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.068
Well, if you want me
a part of this team,

30:09.068 --> 30:10.330
you got to let me in
at some point.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.072
That might not be necessary.

30:13.072 --> 30:15.074
- What's that mean?
- Nothing. Forget it.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.379
See,
that's what I'm talking about.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.772
Every time I ask
a simple question, you just--

30:19.513 --> 30:21.515
Ready to roll?

30:21.515 --> 30:22.690
I am.

30:35.616 --> 30:36.704
That's it.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.445
How do we get in?

30:38.445 --> 30:41.448
There's a knock pattern
known only to members.

30:41.448 --> 30:44.103
I hacked the owner's database.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.342
Thanks.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.040
Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.441
It doesn't bother you
what Vaughn's doing?

31:18.441 --> 31:20.879
Shut up, man.
No names.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.620
Man, I'm just saying.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.622
What he's doing to women,

31:25.622 --> 31:27.711
he's just repeating
what happened to us.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.713
Why are you getting
all serious, man?

31:29.713 --> 31:32.934
Don't you see all
these fat asses in this club?

31:32.934 --> 31:34.327
We need to get you some.

31:34.327 --> 31:37.286
Yeah, it's been a minute.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.680
Hey, is this seat taken?

31:42.552 --> 31:45.338
It is now,
sweet thing.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.168
Do you get all your lines
from the cheese counter?

31:50.865 --> 31:52.345
Got you.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.608
I'm just warming up.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.783
Sit down.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.180
If you want what's good.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.182
Well, is there
a drink in it for me?

32:03.182 --> 32:05.445
Baby,
I'll get you the whole bar.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.753
- She's good.
- Yeah.

32:09.753 --> 32:12.365
Might want
to tell yourself that.

32:12.365 --> 32:15.324
I will as soon
as I stop worrying.

32:15.324 --> 32:17.239
You know Jet is a pro.

32:17.239 --> 32:20.416
So you went
with the pink shirt, huh?

32:20.416 --> 32:23.245
Where'd you get that thing?
- It's salmon, man.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.812
Why, you like it?

32:24.812 --> 32:26.205
Yeah, it's nice.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.989
It'd look good
on my ex-girlfriend.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.730
Who, Gina?

32:29.730 --> 32:31.253
Only thing that would look good
on her is a nose job.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.820
Shut up.
Don't listen to him.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.561
This man, he's crazy.
- He knows. It's the truth.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.997
I'm so sorry
to cut this short.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.433
My friends are ready to go.

32:37.433 --> 32:40.654
Well, can I at least
get your number or something?

32:43.700 --> 32:45.746
Wow.

32:45.746 --> 32:49.097
Damn, you're gonna
do me like that?

32:49.097 --> 32:50.620
Where's your phone?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.458
She likes to be on top.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.426
Now I got you,
and you got me.

33:18.735 --> 33:19.693
Got him.

33:24.828 --> 33:27.831
Thanks to TARU, Special
Narcotics, and no sleep,

33:27.831 --> 33:29.790
the court's got us up
on Manny's phone.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.749
We have all his texts
and contacts, GPS on the phone,

33:32.749 --> 33:35.883
and a tap that
the backup squad is monitoring.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.754
What about the other guy
he was with?

33:37.754 --> 33:39.408
Working on it.
Just gonna take a minute

33:39.408 --> 33:41.367
'cause I didn't get a chance
to clone his phone.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.153
This is Manny.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.330
You want privacy?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.203
Please.

33:53.379 --> 33:54.989
Hey, handsome.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.469
<i>Hey, pretty lady.</i>

33:56.469 --> 33:58.123
<i>When you gonna let me
take you out?</i>

33:58.123 --> 34:01.213
Uh, you tell me.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.215
<i>Well, I was thinking,</i>

34:03.215 --> 34:05.347
<i>how about coming to this party
with me tomorrow night?</i>

34:05.347 --> 34:07.523
Tomorrow?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.395
I thought you said
you were interested.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.440
<i>Oh,
I'm definitely interested,</i>

34:11.440 --> 34:13.921
<i>but, uh,
I'm just busy tonight.</i>

34:13.921 --> 34:16.141
<i>I'll hit you up tomorrow
with details. Cool?</i>

34:16.141 --> 34:18.795
All right, fine.

34:18.795 --> 34:19.970
Wear the pink shirt.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.711
Bye.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.411
Guys like that
have no idea what to do

34:25.411 --> 34:27.674
when a woman takes charge.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.763
Wait, what's that coming up?

34:29.763 --> 34:31.852
Manny's making another call.
Hang on.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.292
<i>Hey, we got another raid.
Biggest score yet.</i>

34:37.292 --> 34:38.902
<i>We're meeting at the spot
at 9:00.</i>

34:38.902 --> 34:40.339
<i>We're trying to win this
and be out.</i>

34:40.339 --> 34:42.297
<i>Word.
Then and there.</i>

34:42.297 --> 34:43.342
"Win this and be out."

34:43.342 --> 34:44.647
One last hit.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.388
It'll be our last chance.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.482
How'd the trial go?

34:53.482 --> 34:55.267
Good.
Got done early.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.051
My wife wanted to go
to Williamsburg.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.793
I thought that meant hopping on
the L, shopping with hipsters,

34:59.793 --> 35:02.535
but she meant
Williamsburg, Virginia.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.406
An educational trip
with the kids.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.017
I like Virginia.
It's for lovers.

35:07.017 --> 35:10.195
16 hours with under-12s in
the back of the car fighting?

35:10.195 --> 35:11.196
I didn't love that.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.501
Well, good to have you back.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.894
Good to be back.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.636
That was Jet.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.420
Strap in.
We're close.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.741
NYPD! Open up!

35:43.793 --> 35:45.491
NYPD!

35:51.714 --> 35:53.368
Don't move!
Don't move!

35:56.284 --> 36:00.070
OCCB 10-13.
Shots fired, shots fired.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.475
Backup's here.

36:13.475 --> 36:14.520
There they are!

36:14.520 --> 36:16.304
Whoa!

36:16.304 --> 36:18.001
What are they doing?

36:18.001 --> 36:19.525
They're shooting at us?

36:25.922 --> 36:27.837
Hey, we're on the job!

36:27.837 --> 36:31.189
We're on the job!
Cease fire!

36:31.189 --> 36:32.277
Retreat!

36:34.540 --> 36:35.758
Police! Don't move!

36:35.758 --> 36:37.107
Police!

36:37.107 --> 36:39.240
Ow!

36:39.240 --> 36:40.241
Leave him!

36:40.241 --> 36:42.635
Get up, man!
Get up! Get up!

36:42.635 --> 36:43.984
I said let's go!

36:43.984 --> 36:45.203
I can't leave him!

36:47.814 --> 36:49.163
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

36:49.163 --> 36:51.731
Face to the ground!
Face to the ground!

36:51.731 --> 36:53.211
Don't move!

36:54.429 --> 36:55.387
Got him?

36:58.781 --> 37:00.870
Rey?

37:13.056 --> 37:16.190
So this is what we've got.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.061
Two IDs

37:18.061 --> 37:21.021
and your blood
at the crime scene.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.024
I mean, forget about
putting you in prison.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.200
We can put you
under the prison.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.030
But you work with us,

37:30.030 --> 37:32.815
your situation gets
a whole hell of a lot better.

37:35.427 --> 37:37.516
Dante is
in critical condition.

37:39.431 --> 37:42.303
You're the only one
that stopped to help him.

37:42.303 --> 37:45.219
The others didn't hesitate
to leave him there to die.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.832
Those the kind of people
you want to be loyal to?

37:52.313 --> 37:55.098
You help us,
you help yourself.

37:57.013 --> 38:00.495
How about
you help me find my lawyer?

38:00.495 --> 38:01.888
How about that?

38:01.888 --> 38:03.890
Well, how about you take
a look at these pictures

38:03.890 --> 38:05.848
and you tell me?

38:05.848 --> 38:07.372
Lawyer's gonna
help you out with that?

38:07.372 --> 38:09.548
You want a lawyer?
We're gonna get you a lawyer.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.853
Right away.

38:22.082 --> 38:25.215
In the meantime,
take a look at those.

38:33.485 --> 38:37.358
I'll call Lillian and have
her press the DA for no bail.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.055
I had him.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.362
You almost had us in trouble,
is what you had.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.627
Hey,
let's talk about tonight.

38:45.627 --> 38:48.804
The cops shooting at us.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.067
- They were returning fire.
- At us.

38:52.895 --> 38:56.029
Not all cops
are crooked now, Elliot.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.465
Is that
what you think I'm saying?

38:57.465 --> 39:01.339
What I think is,
you need to stay quiet

39:01.339 --> 39:03.123
until we can get
to the bottom of this.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.952
Hey, so we had
the team at SVU

39:05.952 --> 39:07.823
run the list of victims
you asked.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.956
Nine women,
17 to 45,

39:09.956 --> 39:12.611
each of them sexually assaulted
by someone posing as a cop.

39:12.611 --> 39:15.396
And Dante, he was the guy
with Manny at Club Luxe.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.006
Just confirmed it.

39:17.006 --> 39:20.227
Well, if Manny doesn't work
out, maybe we've got Dante.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.490
Now he just needs
to stay alive.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.247
Hey.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.948
I spoke to the doctor.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.560
They have to stabilize him
before surgery.

39:50.039 --> 39:53.042
Is he gonna live?

39:53.042 --> 39:55.523
It's touch and go.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.266
So when are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

39:59.266 --> 40:02.400
I saw you at the scene.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.402
You two know each other
or something?

40:11.844 --> 40:14.412
We were
in the same foster home.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.287
We were brothers.

40:22.594 --> 40:26.119
That's Dante, the one in there
fighting for his life.

40:26.119 --> 40:30.384
One in custody,
Manny Rivera.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.735
They called him D-Man
growing up.

40:33.735 --> 40:37.260
And this is you?

40:37.260 --> 40:40.525
They called me Little Rey.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.701
Who's the white kid?

40:42.701 --> 40:44.485
Vaughn.

40:44.485 --> 40:47.401
Vaughn Davis.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.011
Blue Eyes.

40:54.147 --> 40:57.890
What happened
in that house,

40:57.890 --> 41:00.153
I think
it's why he's doing this.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.418
What happened in that house?
