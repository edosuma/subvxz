00:36.903 --> 00:41.772
Oh, go on! Oh!

00:51.818 --> 00:55.219
What - What - What are you doing?

00:57.791 --> 01:01.522
You're hurting me!

01:07.600 --> 01:09.568
I'm gonna tell my Bernard of you!

01:09.669 --> 01:11.637
<i>You're fucking dead!</i>

01:50.076 --> 01:53.204
<i>Oi! Come back here, you!</i>

01:54.247 --> 01:56.147
Ronnie!

01:56.249 --> 01:58.615
Get off that couch
and come out here!

01:58.718 --> 02:00.618
Ronnie!

04:32.005 --> 04:35.202
Oh, shit! Sorry.
I didn't see you there.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.242
Do you live here?

04:37.343 --> 04:40.278
Yeah, I do, unfortunately.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.211
Do you know Louise Clancy?

04:42.315 --> 04:44.078
Yeah. Are you a friend of hers?

04:44.183 --> 04:46.151
Know where she is?

04:46.252 --> 04:48.880
She's at work.

04:48.988 --> 04:52.719
- What time does she get back?
- Don't know. About 7:00 or something.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.690
Fuckin' hell.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.723
Do you want to come in
for a cup of tea?

05:03.269 --> 05:07.137
Is that all right with you, love?
It's just, you know, cold.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.504
Listen, have you got anything
for a headache?

05:09.609 --> 05:11.941
Ah. Yeah, we have, as it happens.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.503
Like a monkey wrench or something.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.175
- What's all this about?
- Oh, yeah.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.811
- That's Sandra, that is.
- Hello, Sandra.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.913
This is her place.
She's a fucking nurse.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.754
That's her idea of interior design.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.760
Oh, yeah, it's a skeleton.

05:29.862 --> 05:32.330
And this is her cocktail cabinet and all.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.630
There you go.
That should do it.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.169
No, it's too big.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.604
- <i>Do you want a cup of tea?</i>
- Yeah.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.235
So, are you Louise's boyfriend?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.540
- No.
- Oh, right.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.343
- What, you're just, like, a mate?
- Primate.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.681
- You must be the missing link then.
- Yeah, that's me.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.654
- You're not gonna tell me your name.
- No.

05:58.758 --> 06:02.023
- I'm not gonna tell you mine neither.
- All right. We'll be strangers.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.854
- <i>I see your boomerang came back then, love.</i>
- <i>It's not my fuckin' boomerang.</i>

06:06.966 --> 06:09.434
<i>What about the old diminishing
pachyderm formation there?</i>

06:09.535 --> 06:14.404
<i>No, that's all Sandra's collection.
She's in Zimbabwe at the moment.</i>

06:14.507 --> 06:17.806
And fuck knows what she's
gonna bring back from there.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.504
Polagra or hepatitis "B" or something.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.581
She's with her boyfriend.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.658
So, how is Louise?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.160
I don't know.
I don't know her as well as you.

06:36.262 --> 06:40.164
- Do you get on with her?
- Well, been out a couple of times.

06:40.266 --> 06:43.133
- Does she like you?
- I don't know.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.704
You better ask her.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.864
Most people don't.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.442
<i>Do you find that she's
at all jealous of you?</i>

06:52.011 --> 06:53.979
No.

06:57.583 --> 07:02.486
So - So, would you describe yourself
as a happy little person?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.182
Yeah. I'm the life and soul.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.129
<i>Have you ever thought, right-
I mean, you don't know...</i>

07:11.230 --> 07:15.428
but you might already have had the happiest moment 
in your whole fucking life...

07:15.535 --> 07:19.665
and all you've got to look forward to
is sickness and purgatory?

07:21.207 --> 07:23.641
Oh, shit.

07:23.743 --> 07:27.543
Well, I just live from day to day myself.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.207
I tend to skip a day now and again. 
You know what I mean?

07:30.316 --> 07:34.047
I used to be a werewolf,
but I'm all right now! 

07:34.153 --> 07:38.249
Fuckin' hell.
I bet they're happy, eh?

07:38.357 --> 07:41.849
All they got to do is sit round,
howling at the moon.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.930
It's better than standing on the 
cheesy fucking thing. Know what I mean?

07:45.031 --> 07:47.829
I mean, tossing all these satellites
and shuttles out into the cosmos.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.562
What do they think they're gonna find
up there that they can't find down here?

07:50.670 --> 07:51.925
They think if they piss high enough...

07:52.070 --> 07:55.266
they're gonna come across the monkey 
with the beard and the crap ideas?

07:55.374 --> 07:57.365
And it's, like,
"Oh! There you are, captain!

07:57.477 --> 08:01.607
Are you busy? Because I've got
a few fundamental questions for you."

08:01.714 --> 08:04.512
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.745
'Cause let's face it, right?
What are rockets?

08:07.854 --> 08:10.823
I mean, they're just big, metal pricks.

08:10.923 --> 08:15.724
<i>You know, I mean, the bastards
aren't satisfied with fucking the Earth up.</i>

08:15.828 --> 08:19.389
- <i>They've gotta fuck space and all.</i>
- Tell me something, love.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.725
Are you aware of the effect...

08:23.836 --> 08:27.499
you have on the average mammalian, 
Mancunian...

08:27.607 --> 08:29.734
X-Y'ly chromosome, slavering...

08:29.842 --> 08:32.504
lusty male member of the species?

08:32.611 --> 08:34.807
Uh... yeah.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.972
I thought so.

08:51.497 --> 08:55.490
- Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
- No.

08:55.601 --> 09:00.004
- Do you think women like being raped?
- You talk a lot, don't you?

09:01.507 --> 09:03.975
Do you like Japanese food?

09:04.076 --> 09:06.704
Look, I've told you, I'm not interested.
All right?

09:06.812 --> 09:09.576
- Could I have that a touch harder, please?
- Yes.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.902
All right?
Enjoying yourself, are you?

09:35.007 --> 09:38.568
I'm having a great time, actually.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.747
- Bloody hell.
- Ah, friendly.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.150
What are you doing here?
You look like shit.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.383
Just trying to blend in 
with the surroundings.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.854
<i>Halitosis, halitosis, halitosis</i> 

10:02.535 --> 10:05.003
- I can't believe you're here.
- I'm not here.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.768
I tell you what.
It's a crackin' place you got, love.

10:09.875 --> 10:13.174
- Good. I'm glad you like it.
- No, I was being sarcastic.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.840
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would have met you off the train.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.782
- I didn't come on the fucking train.
- <i>Off the bus then.</i>

10:19.885 --> 10:22.376
- <i>I didn't come on the bus either.</i>
- So how did you get here then?

10:22.488 --> 10:26.083
Well, basically, there was this little dot,
right, and the dot went bang...

10:26.192 --> 10:28.660
and the bang expanded -
energy formed into matter.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.059
Matter cooled, matter lived,
the amoeba to fish, the fish to fowl...

10:31.163 --> 10:33.961
the fowl to froggy, the froggy to mammal,
the mammal to monkey, the monkey to man.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.126
Amo, amas, amat. <i>Quid pro quo.</i>
<i>Memento mori. Ad infinitum.</i>

10:37.236 --> 10:40.694
Sprinkle on a little bit of grated cheese
and leave under the grill till doomsday.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.572
- I see you haven't changed.
- He's a fuckin' genius, this geezer.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.202
I take it you met
my wicky-wacky friend Sophie.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.381
Oh, no. Actually, we haven't been 
formally introduced. 

10:50.413 --> 10:51.281
- Have we, love?
- No.

10:51.383 --> 10:55.242
No, we've been sat here 
in embarrassing silence all afternoon. 

10:56.689 --> 11:00.056
- So, how are you?
- Peachy creamy.

11:03.863 --> 11:07.162
Are you really?
I'm very pleased.

11:07.266 --> 11:10.724
So, how's, um - 
Work?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.000
- It's all right.
- "It's all right."

11:12.033 --> 11:13.600
It's all right. 

11:13.706 --> 11:15.970
- Is it everything you hoped it would be?
- Yeah.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.407
What did you hope it would be?

11:23.916 --> 11:26.544
I'm so - I'm sorry.
Did you get that?

11:26.652 --> 11:28.020
<i>It's everything she hoped it would be...</i>

11:28.160 --> 11:30.520
<i>but she doesn't fucking know 
what she hoped it would be.</i>

11:30.623 --> 11:34.252
Oh, and by the way,
thank you for this.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.693
I mean, are you taking a piss or what?

11:38.731 --> 11:41.427
"So, Johnny, my address is" -

11:45.538 --> 11:48.029
I'm touched.

11:52.378 --> 11:56.212
- Why have you come?
- Oh, can you tell from there?

11:56.315 --> 11:58.943
Do you want a cup of tea?

11:59.051 --> 12:03.351
I'd love a cup of tea! 
You're fucking generous, you Cockneys, aren't ya?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.151
- <i>Sophie?</i>
- Oh, yeah. Ta.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.718
- How's your mum?
- Fine. How's yours? Still pulling pints?

12:41.827 --> 12:44.728
She's dead.
She's still a good fuck though.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.697
<i>I mean, the rates are a bit extortionate...</i>

12:47.800 --> 12:50.701
but I do get a discount
what with being the son and everything.

12:50.803 --> 12:54.933
Apparently, you shouldn't stick anything 
up your cunt that you can't put in your mouth.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.668
Give us that mug.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.838
Can I try your coat on, Johnny?

13:03.682 --> 13:05.582
Yeah.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.620
So what you been up to?
Have you seen anybody?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.951
Have you seen anybody?

13:12.391 --> 13:14.689
<i>Have you spoken to anybody 
from Manchester?</i>

13:14.794 --> 13:16.762
<i>Yeah, I phoned June 
a couple of times.</i>

13:16.862 --> 13:19.922
<i>And was June interested
in what you had to say?</i>

13:21.433 --> 13:24.368
Fuckin' hell. I've seen more life
in an open grave.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.111
Come on!

13:25.161 --> 13:26.370
- What?
- What! 

13:26.472 --> 13:29.339
- You don't seem very pleased to see me.
- I am pleased to see ya!

13:29.441 --> 13:33.434
You too good for us? Now you've got yourself 
a posh job in the big "shitty."

13:33.546 --> 13:35.446
- <i>Me and her are on the fucking dole.</i>
- Right.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.914
- You're a career girl. You happy with that?
- Yeah.

13:37.148 --> 13:38.371
- Are you sure? 
- Yeah.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.042
I'm delighted!

13:46.258 --> 13:49.489
Do you want some of this, Johnny?

13:49.595 --> 13:52.996
Fuckin' hell, love.
What are you trying to do to me?

13:59.171 --> 14:02.140
Right. Well, I'm going up to my room.
Do you want to see it, Johnny?

14:02.241 --> 14:04.801
<i>Is it worth the bother?
Is there anything worth seeing?</i>

14:04.910 --> 14:07.640
Why don't you come and find out?
It's not very far.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.357
I'm sorry about this.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.161
Yeah.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.901
Oh, move, move.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.677
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm in here.</i>

14:49.255 --> 14:51.155
Oh, it's de-lovely.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.488
<i>I see you've got a ceiling at the top
with a floor on the lower level...</i>

14:54.593 --> 14:56.686
and a wall at either side.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.923
And only a single bed.
Sad, really.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.838
- You've got wonderful breasts.
- Don't you mean "tits"?

15:14.947 --> 15:18.883
<i>Are they both the same size,
or is one bigger than the other?</i>

15:18.984 --> 15:21.179
I don't know.
Do you want to weigh them?

15:22.855 --> 15:25.483
- Is that a proposition?
- No, it's a threat.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.135
Are you rich?

15:37.236 --> 15:39.204
Life is for enjoying.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.398
<i>What about a family?
Have you got any brothers or sisters?</i>

15:41.507 --> 15:43.475
I try not to remember.

15:45.177 --> 15:49.443
You're sexually frustrated, aren't you?

15:49.548 --> 15:51.243
- What's funny?
- Are you a feminist?

15:51.350 --> 15:54.046
- No.
- Do you like fucking?

15:54.153 --> 15:56.621
- Do you like wanking?
- Not on my own, no.

16:03.028 --> 16:07.328
That's a very ornithological mutilation 
you've got there, love.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.765
That's my tribal initiation.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.171
Is it really?

16:21.613 --> 16:24.741
- That was fuckin' athletic, that was.
- I think I ruptured my chakras.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.943
Is there an instruction manual for this garb?

16:29.054 --> 16:31.614
No. It's an intelligence test.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.158
Now, what is this?
A granny, a sheepshank...

16:34.259 --> 16:36.887
or the infamous round turn
and two half hitches...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.191
as mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel?

16:39.298 --> 16:42.426
- Are you finished?
- Hardly fuckin' begun.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.901
It's just I think I'm gonna get into difficulties
when I reach the hippie shit up here.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.634
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Well, you've tried the stairs.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.438
I think we should take the escalator.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.535
Simple really.

16:54.646 --> 16:58.446
- So is this.
- Thanks for the mammaries.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.881
Could you ask her to order me a taxi, please?

17:02.988 --> 17:06.946
- This is terribly disappointing.
- You don't like rejection, do you, Jeremy?

17:07.059 --> 17:10.517
- Could we have a taxi, please?
- No problem... sir.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.014
Whee!

18:57.703 --> 19:00.171
It's really cozy, this.

19:03.108 --> 19:05.576
Will you let me come again, Jerry?

19:07.846 --> 19:10.314
You're dead handsome, you know.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.054
What work do you do?

19:18.957 --> 19:20.925
I'm a dancer, actually.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.254
Don't you wanna know me name?

19:26.365 --> 19:28.265
It's Giselle.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.770
Are you married?

19:35.807 --> 19:39.265
What?

19:41.813 --> 19:43.713
Kiss me.

20:00.399 --> 20:03.095
Oh, don't. It's yucky!

20:03.202 --> 20:05.102
Get it off!

20:09.441 --> 20:11.466
Are you glad I came?

20:11.577 --> 20:14.375
What are you doing?
Get off me!

20:16.048 --> 20:20.712
You're hurting me!

20:20.819 --> 20:23.686
- Have you ever thought of committing suicide?
- No.

20:23.789 --> 20:27.350
I'm going to commit suicide
on my 40th birthday...

20:27.459 --> 20:29.359
if I'm still around.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.395
- Why?
- I don't want to be old.

20:31.496 --> 20:33.987
Do you?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.522
Fuck.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.161
Oh, God.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.953
- Oh. Have a fag.
- Yeah, thanks. I will.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.600
What are you reading?

21:58.016 --> 22:01.577
Will you stop fucking about and fidgeting
in my peripherals? I'm trying to concentrate.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.952
She's got a very little waist,
Sophie, ain't she?

22:06.224 --> 22:08.590
She's got little tits and all.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.731
- Are you not cold?
- I'm reading about the butterfly effect.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.665
What's the butterfly effect?

22:17.769 --> 22:20.294
Every time a butterfly
flaps its wings in Tokyo...

22:20.405 --> 22:22.930
this old granny in Salford
gets a bilious attack.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.771
What happens if a butterfly
flaps its wings in Salford?

22:27.112 --> 22:29.740
- That's not the point.
- Oh, is it not?

22:32.818 --> 22:35.446
- What are you doing in London, Johnny?
- What are you doing in London?

22:35.554 --> 22:38.819
- <i>I've told you what I'm doing in London.</i>
- You've told me nothing.

22:40.659 --> 22:44.095
- The last time I saw you, I told you -
- Fuckin' hell! Were you born irritatin'?

22:45.764 --> 22:47.857
What have you come downstairs for anyway?

22:47.966 --> 22:50.434
I fell asleep with the window open.
I was cold. I came down.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.935
I had to pee. I've made some tea.
I'm here. All right?

22:53.038 --> 22:56.201
- What's that, the greatest story ever told?
- I live here.

23:00.512 --> 23:04.209
So what happened?
Were you bored in Manchester?

23:04.316 --> 23:08.184
Was I bored? No, I wasn't fuckin' bored.
I'm never bored.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.153
<i>That's the trouble with everybody.
You're all so bored.</i>

23:11.256 --> 23:13.724
You've had nature explained to you,
and you're bored with it.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.521
You've had the living body explained to you,
and you're bored with it.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.222
You've had the universe explained to you,
and you're bored with it.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.458
So now you just want cheap thrills
and plenty of 'em...

23:21.566 --> 23:24.228
and it don't matter how tawdry 
or vacuous they are as long as it's new...

23:24.336 --> 23:27.863
as long as it's new, as long as it flashes
and fucking bleeps in 40 different colors.

23:27.973 --> 23:31.272
<i>Well, whatever else you can say about me,
I'm not fuckin' bored.</i>

23:31.376 --> 23:33.344
Yeah. All right.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.710
So how's it all going for you?

23:36.815 --> 23:38.680
It's a bit boring, actually.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.876
You're not enjoying yourself?

23:43.822 --> 23:46.313
<i>Have you made many friends?</i>

23:46.425 --> 23:48.325
No.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.022
Have you got a goblet or something,
because me heart's bleedin'.

23:54.533 --> 23:57.093
<i>When are you going back to Manchester?</i>

23:57.202 --> 23:59.830
- When are you going back to Manchester?
- I'm not going back.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.838
- <i>Why not?</i>
- You know why not.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.532
Do I?

24:05.577 --> 24:07.875
I thought you said
you never wanted to see me again.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.447
I don't ever want to see you again.
So will you fuck off back upstairs?

24:10.549 --> 24:14.349
- Why are you such a bastard, Johnny?
- Monkey see, monkey do.

24:14.453 --> 24:19.117
What does that mean?

24:21.092 --> 24:25.290
- Oh, this fucking cough.
- A butterfly must have flapped its wings.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.594
So have you got to get up 
for work now, yeah?

24:33.004 --> 24:35.700
No. It's too early.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.277
I'm going back to bed.

24:51.756 --> 24:55.783
So is she, uh, a Buddhist or something,
this nurse?

24:55.894 --> 24:58.419
No, she's a Catholic.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.055
What's she doing with the old fat chap 
in the house then?

25:01.166 --> 25:04.602
<i>I don't know.
I think she fancies him or something.</i>

25:04.703 --> 25:06.796
Louise is a Catholic.
Did you know that?

25:06.905 --> 25:09.874
- <i>She's not, is she?</i>
- Oh, fuckin' hell!

25:18.583 --> 25:21.381
<i>You know what frightens me
about the human body?</i>

25:21.486 --> 25:23.283
What?

25:23.388 --> 25:26.755
Well, it's like the, uh, most sophisticated 
mechanism in the entire universe...

25:26.858 --> 25:28.985
and yet it's so fuckin' quiet, isn't it?

25:29.094 --> 25:33.963
- <i>Know what I mean?</i>
- Don't know. Mine makes enough noise.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.863
It's like this, uh, wet, pink factory.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.436
What the fuck are they making in there?
I mean, what's the product?

25:39.538 --> 25:42.996
You never see no delivery trucks
coming or going, do you?

25:44.543 --> 25:48.240
- I could have been a doctor.
- Do you wanna examine me?

25:48.346 --> 25:51.315
- You don't believe me, do you?
- I believe everything you say.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.044
- I've got "A" level psychology.
- You haven't.

25:56.521 --> 26:00.423
"Resolve is never stronger than in the morning
after the night it was never weaker."

26:00.525 --> 26:02.993
- What do you think of that?
- It's a load of bollocks.

26:04.829 --> 26:06.797
I thought of that.

26:07.832 --> 26:11.029
- Do you not agree with it?
- Don't know.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.934
Well, that's 'cause you weren't 
fuckin' listening, were you?

26:14.039 --> 26:17.008
What's this?
A test or something?

26:30.088 --> 26:32.318
Don't. Stop it.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.517
Just pack it in. Stop it!

26:35.560 --> 26:37.528
Keep buggering about.

26:40.565 --> 26:43.363
- Let me get a watch, Johnny.
- Will you keep still?

26:43.468 --> 26:46.767
- Look, you can get me a watch.
- Don't want a fucking watch.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.618
I really like you, Johnny.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.088
You don't know me.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.181
I think I do.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.988
- But you don't fucking know me!
- Oh, shit!

27:10.095 --> 27:11.995
Fucking hell!

27:12.097 --> 27:14.031
- You still like me?
- I love you.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.066
- What?
- I'm in love with you, Johnny.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.362
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

27:25.810 --> 27:30.042
I understand you, Johnny. I do.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.461
Johnny! No! No!

27:46.564 --> 27:49.226
Johnny!

27:53.238 --> 27:55.206
Ta-ra, Mr. Halpern.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.409
What's the matter?
What's going on?

28:31.509 --> 28:33.477
Fucked if I know.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.212
I'm too old for all this.

28:46.958 --> 28:50.223
Why don't we go out?
Go out for a drink or somethin'?

28:50.328 --> 28:52.660
Why don't you go out?
Go for a drink or somethin'.

28:52.764 --> 28:54.959
'Cause I want to go out with you.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.968
Is this good?

29:04.809 --> 29:08.040
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

29:08.146 --> 29:10.114
- I'm cold.
- Johnny, I just -

29:10.215 --> 29:12.183
Get off of me.

29:20.325 --> 29:23.624
How - Do you ever get the feeling
that you're being followed?

29:24.662 --> 29:28.359
Look, will you just leave me alone,
give me a bit of room or something?

29:52.323 --> 29:54.223
Fucking hell!

29:56.561 --> 29:59.121
Johnny! Johnny!

30:00.732 --> 30:03.701
What's all that about?
What are you playin' at?

30:07.539 --> 30:09.439
- Where are you going, Johnny?
- Off my head.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.736
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.197
- I want to come with you! 
- Don't you fucking come with me!

30:15.280 --> 30:17.942
- Are you comin' back?
- <i>What the fuck for?</i>

31:12.103 --> 31:14.003
Maggie!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.116
<i>Maggie!</i>

31:29.187 --> 31:32.156
You all right there, chief?

31:37.762 --> 31:39.855
- Have you lost somebody?
- Yeah?

31:39.964 --> 31:43.923
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Fuck off, cunt!

31:55.813 --> 31:58.077
- Got a fag?
- Yes, thanks.

31:58.182 --> 32:00.514
- Yeah, I got one.
- Giz one.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.245
- Please.
- What?

32:02.353 --> 32:05.481
- Say please.
- Just fucking giz one. Come on, mister.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.991
You've got a lovely way about you.
Has anybody ever told you that?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.653
"Thank you." It's all right.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.141
Maggie!

32:24.242 --> 32:26.369
- She's gone, mate.
- Eh?

32:26.477 --> 32:29.002
Those days are over.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.082
Have you seen a lassie
wandering about here?

32:32.183 --> 32:35.380
- What?
- A lassie - black hair, blue jeans.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.717
I saw a little border collie
padding off down there towards the fire.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.791
Yeah?

32:41.826 --> 32:44.795
- Have you lost your bird or something?
- Aye. Have you seen her?

32:44.896 --> 32:46.989
Black hair.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.998
- No.
- Fuckin' hell!

32:49.100 --> 32:51.898
Stupid fuckin' cunt's gone and got lost.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.130
- Are you from Scotland?
- Uh?

32:54.238 --> 32:56.001
- Are you Scots?
- Aye.

32:56.107 --> 33:00.441
- What's it like up there?
- Fucking shite. I'll kick her fanny, man.

33:00.545 --> 33:03.013
- Do you dream in Scotch?
- Uh?

33:03.114 --> 33:05.742
Like, dream about sporran-clad,
caber-tossing haggis...

33:05.850 --> 33:07.818
galloping over porridge-covered glens?

33:07.919 --> 33:09.546
Fucking shite!

33:09.654 --> 33:12.851
I sent off for one of those little Linguaphone
packages - "Talk Shite in a Fortnight."

33:12.957 --> 33:16.415
It's all going very well. I haven't quite got 
the hang of the transitive verbs yet.

33:16.527 --> 33:18.995
Will you fuckin' shut it?

33:23.735 --> 33:26.101
- So, what you doin' down here?
- Eh?

33:26.204 --> 33:29.196
Why are you here in London,
old Bodhi Dharma?

33:29.307 --> 33:31.798
Put my old man in hospital.

33:31.909 --> 33:33.570
- Your dad?
- Aye.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.340
- How did you do that then?
- Cracked him on the nut with a poker.

33:36.447 --> 33:39.075
- What for?
- He was fuckin' asking for it!

33:39.183 --> 33:42.118
- Maggie!
- So, what, is he in a bad way?

33:42.220 --> 33:44.120
Fuckin' right. He's half dead.

33:44.222 --> 33:47.589
- What does your mum think about it?
- She's off her fuckin' nut.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.819
- So, you're, like, on the run, yeah?
- Aye.

33:49.927 --> 33:53.363
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah? The cops after you? Yeah?

33:53.464 --> 33:56.399
- Can you tell me something, jock?
- What?

33:56.501 --> 33:59.629
- What's all that about?
- Eh?

33:59.737 --> 34:03.036
That - the old Highland fling there.
You know you're doing that?

34:03.141 --> 34:05.609
- What?
- That - you know, "and for my next tick" - 

34:05.710 --> 34:08.735
That. Look, it - it just happened again.
I'm not imagining it.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.110
Fuck off, eh?

34:10.201 --> 34:12.976
You do that in the sack, 
with the old tick, spit - "Maggie!" 

34:13.083 --> 34:15.382
- Must be a great fucking shag.
- Are you taking a piss?

34:15.485 --> 34:18.114
- You're fucking giving it away, aren't ya?
- Fucking come on, cunt!

34:18.222 --> 34:21.190
Cut your fucking head open!
Eh?

34:21.292 --> 34:23.886
- What's it like being you?
- Eh?

34:23.995 --> 34:26.623
- A bit hectic?
- Fuck off, poof!

34:29.500 --> 34:31.967
Do you believe in self-fulfilling prophecy?

34:32.070 --> 34:34.594
Eh?

34:34.705 --> 34:36.672
You know, like Nostradamus.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.443
He was, like, 
this 16th-century astrologer...

34:40.545 --> 34:44.606
and he wrote in one of his quatrains that 
this goon called Hister would invade Poland.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.945
So Hitler reads that and thinks,
"Hister, Hitler.

34:47.051 --> 34:48.985
Must mean me",
and invades Poland.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.545
So when the guy prophesied that the world
would end in 1999, which he did...

34:52.657 --> 34:55.284
does that therefore mean
that we're fulfilling the prophecy...

34:55.393 --> 34:57.293
by precipitating the Apocalypse?

34:57.395 --> 34:59.022
- You with me?
- What?

34:59.130 --> 35:02.099
You think the world will end in 1999?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.168
Listen, mate, what do you think of this?

35:06.270 --> 35:09.239
Why don't you go have a little wander around
and go look for the wee lassie, and I'll wait here?

35:09.340 --> 35:11.365
- If she turns up, I'll keep her here until you get back.
- Aye?

35:11.476 --> 35:13.376
- How does that grab ya?
- You gonna be here, eh?

35:13.478 --> 35:15.708
- Yeah.
- Right. If she gets back, right...

35:15.813 --> 35:17.872
tell her to fucking wait here
till I get back.

35:17.982 --> 35:20.576
If she wanders off, knock her out.
You slap her good for me, right?

35:20.685 --> 35:22.676
- Yeah, I'll tie her up.
- Aye.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.551
- You gonna be here, eh?
- Yeah. Oh, listen. What's her name again?

35:25.656 --> 35:27.556
- Maggie.
- Oh, yeah.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.626
Be back in a minute, right?

35:45.710 --> 35:47.678
Excuse me, love.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.646
Hello!

35:51.749 --> 35:54.718
- Are you Maggie?
- Piss off!

36:01.225 --> 36:03.352
- Oh, you're Maggie.
- What?

36:03.461 --> 36:05.725
- Is your name Maggie?
- How'd you ken that?

36:05.830 --> 36:09.527
It's just a hunch.
Are you looking for the, uh, petulant dwarf?

36:09.634 --> 36:12.068
- Eh?
- <i>Sprechen Sie Deutsches?</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:14.730
- Archie!
- Yeah, th - that's the fella.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.275
I was told to wait here for you.
You're Maggie, he's Archie, I'm nobody.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.844
- He's gone off looking for you, love.
- What, you've seen him?

36:20.945 --> 36:23.072
Look, would you just come
and sit over here now?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.547
Fuck off, you dirty cunt.

36:25.650 --> 36:29.450
I know I've not had a bath for a good few seasons,
but there's no need to hurt my feelings.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.988
He'll be back in a minute.

36:32.089 --> 36:34.717
- What, he's been here?
- He's been here, he's been there.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.725
He's been all over the fuckin' shop.

36:36.827 --> 36:39.352
- Did he have the chips with him?
- He had a huge one on his shoulder.

36:39.463 --> 36:42.432
- Fuckin' wee radge!
- Come on. No need to knock the young lad.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.366
He's a wonderful exponent
of the old Socratic debate.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.069
Listen, love,
I've got this great idea.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.805
Why don't you have a little wander round,
see if you can find the wee lad?

36:55.913 --> 36:59.371
I'll wait here. And if he turns up,
I'll keep him here till you get back.

36:59.483 --> 37:02.281
I'm fucking starvin'.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.946
- Do you wanna get something to eat?
- He's got all the money, hasn't he?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.024
- Who, laughing boy?
- Aye.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.322
- Well, I've got a few bob on me.
- What if he comes back and we're no here?

37:11.429 --> 37:14.398
- We'll leave him a note.
- He won't be able to read it.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.102
Well, we'll get him on his bleeper.
Come on.

37:32.950 --> 37:35.111
Can you feel all those vibrations?

37:35.219 --> 37:37.779
No.

37:37.888 --> 37:41.517
Just stand still a minute, love.
Try and feel it through your feet.

37:43.628 --> 37:46.825
Do you not get all those tremblings 
and mumblings coming up through your bones?

37:46.931 --> 37:49.695
Not really, no.

37:49.800 --> 37:53.236
Do you not get, like, a sense of, like,
a whole other world underneath all this?

37:53.337 --> 37:55.305
You know, like, the guts of London?

37:55.406 --> 37:57.874
What with all the tube trains
and everything, the city's viscera...

37:57.975 --> 38:01.103
and the subterranean fucking fistulas
and conduits and colons...

38:01.212 --> 38:03.680
and bunkers and dungeons and tombs 
and all that.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.341
What, about hell and the sewers, like?

38:06.450 --> 38:09.579
You know that wherever you are in London,
you're only 30 feet away from a rat.

38:09.687 --> 38:10.580
Aye.

38:10.687 --> 38:12.451
- Does that freak you out?
- No. 

38:12.556 --> 38:15.354
- Do you believe in hell?
- Aye.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.825
- So do you believe in the devil?
- Aye.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.897
- What do you think he looks like?
- He looks like that, doesn't he?

38:20.998 --> 38:24.297
What, a little nudist homonculus 
with a pink quiff?

38:24.402 --> 38:27.132
- No, he looks like a snake.
- Let's have a look at that.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.168
- It's Archie, isn't it?
- It's my good luck charm.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.800
- Has it brought you much?
- Has it fuck.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.038
- Are you superstitious?
- No.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.547
What do you wear
a good luck charm for then?

38:38.649 --> 38:41.117
Are we gonna get something to eat 
or what?

38:45.056 --> 38:48.150
Have you ever seen a dead body?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.659
Only me own.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.226
Where was you thinking 
of sleeping tonight?

38:58.336 --> 39:01.237
- Don't know.
- Where did you kip down last night?

39:01.339 --> 39:03.466
- In the park.
- Was that not cold?

39:03.574 --> 39:05.667
Aye.

39:05.776 --> 39:07.744
Where are you thinking of sleeping, like?

39:07.845 --> 39:09.813
Wherever I drop.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.079
- How old are you, love?
- Twenty-three.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.279
- Do your mum and dad know you're down here?
- No.

39:17.388 --> 39:20.152
- Will they not be worried about you?
- No.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.225
How old are you, like?

39:23.294 --> 39:26.195
- How old do you think I am?
- About 40.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.533
- I'm 27.
- Oh, get the fuck.

39:38.509 --> 39:41.808
- <i>Where the fuck have you been?</i>
- Where the fuck have you been?

39:41.912 --> 39:45.541
- Eh?
- I've been waitin' on you!

39:45.649 --> 39:48.209
- What the fuck you been doin' now?
- You've got all the money!

39:48.319 --> 39:50.617
- I've been fucking looking all over for ya!
- Well, I was with him.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.521
- What do you - Fuck!
- I was fucking with him!

39:54.625 --> 39:56.752
- Daft cunt.
- Fuckin' ask him!

39:56.861 --> 39:58.761
- Fuck off!
- Fuckin' ask him!

39:58.863 --> 40:00.990
- Fuckin' daft bitch! Eh?
- Where's my chips?

40:01.098 --> 40:04.397
That was fuckin' years ago.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.630
- Fucking here are your fucking chips!
- Don't come near me!

40:07.738 --> 40:09.638
Fucking cunt!

40:54.685 --> 40:56.653
Did he hurt you?

40:58.522 --> 41:00.547
What do you mean?

41:00.658 --> 41:04.185
You know, when you were fucking.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.490
Why? Did he hurt you?

41:10.367 --> 41:13.734
Do you think you were made 
for each other?

41:13.838 --> 41:16.932
- Well, we went out for a year.
- A year?

41:17.041 --> 41:19.669
Fucking hell, give me a year!

41:21.679 --> 41:25.137
Do you ever feel like topping yourself?

41:27.351 --> 41:31.481
- Oh, God. I wish I was at home.
- Glad I'm not.

41:31.589 --> 41:35.582
Yeah, well, I don't mean with me mum and dad.
I just mean in Manchester.

41:35.693 --> 41:39.185
- You reckon it's different there, do you?
- Yeah. People talked to you.

41:39.296 --> 41:42.754
- Well, I'm talking to you.
- Yeah, but you talk a pile of shit.

41:44.568 --> 41:49.528
Doesn't matter where you are anyway.
Might as well be in Zimbabwe with Sandra.

41:51.742 --> 41:54.540
Are you gonna do any washing up
before she gets back?

41:54.645 --> 41:57.773
Yeah, of course I am.
When is she getting back?

41:58.916 --> 42:01.146
Sunday.

42:01.252 --> 42:04.050
Well, it's four fucking days away, innit?

42:14.064 --> 42:17.192
"Thou shalt not consent unto him,
nor harken unto him...

42:17.301 --> 42:19.997
"neither shall thou pity him,
neither shall thou stare...

42:20.104 --> 42:22.766
"neither shall thou conceal him,
but thou shalt surely kill him...

42:22.873 --> 42:25.000
with thy hand" -

42:37.955 --> 42:39.923
Lost me place now.

42:41.759 --> 42:44.227
"And thou shalt stone him
with stones till he die...

42:44.328 --> 42:47.456
"because he has sought to force thee away
from the Lord, thy God, and" -

42:47.565 --> 42:49.863
Fuckin' hell.
Why hast thou forsaken me?

42:49.967 --> 42:51.867
Bastard.

42:59.443 --> 43:01.343
Hmm.

43:16.860 --> 43:20.796
Is that it now then?
Are you through with the regulation pacing?

43:20.898 --> 43:22.866
Are you all set to deploy 
the fatuous sarcasm?

43:22.967 --> 43:25.162
Well, I've beaten you to it.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.396
Would you like a mint?

43:27.504 --> 43:30.166
What's this, a new policy?
Ply the culprit with menthol?

43:30.274 --> 43:32.242
Extra strong.

43:35.346 --> 43:37.507
I get through four packets 
of these a night.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.607
You want to be careful, don't you?
I don't want your poxy mint.

43:40.718 --> 43:44.552
Oh. Waste not, want not.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.520
And other clichés.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.354
Ah, but a cliché is full of truth,
otherwise it wouldn't be a cliché.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.428
<i>Which is in itself a cliché.</i>

43:54.865 --> 43:57.925
- Tell me, have you read the book of Hosea?
- What now?

43:58.035 --> 44:01.562
- "For they are the children of whores."
- There's no need to get personal, mate.

44:02.740 --> 44:06.198
What, will you stop fucking about?
If you're gonna stick the boot in, get on with it.

44:20.224 --> 44:22.158
Have you got nowhere to go then?

44:22.259 --> 44:25.626
I've got an infinite number of fucking places 
to go. The problem is where you stay.

44:25.729 --> 44:29.096
- <i>You with me?</i>
- Indeed. Yes.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.463
So, listen, is there much security
in this job?

44:33.137 --> 44:35.162
Too much.

44:39.043 --> 44:42.843
What is it that goes on in this particular
postmodernist gas chamber?

44:44.048 --> 44:46.881
Nothing. It's empty.

44:47.918 --> 44:50.910
So what is it that you're guarding?

44:51.021 --> 44:53.319
Space.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.656
You guarding space?

44:56.760 --> 45:00.355
That's stupid, isn't it, because someone could 
break in there and steal all the fucking space...

45:00.464 --> 45:02.932
and you wouldn't know it had gone, 
would you?

45:04.068 --> 45:05.968
Good point.

45:08.739 --> 45:10.639
All right.

45:52.216 --> 45:56.846
All right, pally, I appreciate you've got a job to do, 
and it's, "Move on! Move on! Move on!"

45:56.954 --> 45:58.922
But it's fucking freezing out there,
and I was a Caesarean.

45:59.022 --> 46:00.922
- Come on, quick.
- What?

46:01.024 --> 46:02.924
Come in.

46:06.630 --> 46:09.428
- You serious?
- Through that door, smartish.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.407
It's a funny smell in here.

46:18.509 --> 46:20.409
Come on.

46:23.847 --> 46:26.315
<i>Quite a waste of space,
all this, isn't it?</i>

46:26.416 --> 46:29.078
<i>Could sleep a thousand 
flea-bitten tramps in here.</i>

46:29.186 --> 46:31.279
What's all that?

46:31.388 --> 46:33.856
They say it's a fucking jungle out there.
Have you seen it in here?

46:33.957 --> 46:36.425
<i>I mean, where's the bloody monkeys?</i>

46:36.527 --> 46:38.791
Look, dad! Will you just back off?

46:38.896 --> 46:41.364
- What is it you're after?
- You must be invisible.

46:41.465 --> 46:44.400
- What?
- I must be seen.

46:44.501 --> 46:46.401
Follow me.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.283
Sit there.

47:02.786 --> 47:06.620
- Am I allowed to smoke in here?
- No. You'll set off the alarm.

47:08.058 --> 47:10.492
<i>Now, I'm not gonna look at you.</i>

47:10.594 --> 47:12.994
It mustn't look 
like I'm talking to anybody.

47:13.096 --> 47:15.963
If you're seen in here,
I'm out of a job.

47:16.066 --> 47:18.330
See what I mean?

47:18.435 --> 47:21.404
If they see you talking to yourself like that,
you'll be out of a job anyway.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.065
They'll come after you
with a big butterfly net.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.632
Oh, yes.
I'll stand like this then.

47:29.479 --> 47:31.640
- <i>Well, that's better, isn't it?</i>
- What?

47:31.748 --> 47:33.739
In, out of the cold.

47:35.252 --> 47:37.720
Yeah.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.789
Yeah. Thanks very much.

47:43.227 --> 47:45.718
It's funny being inside, innit?

47:45.829 --> 47:49.424
'Cause when you are inside,
you're still actually outside, aren't ya?

47:49.533 --> 47:51.831
And then you can say,
when you're outside, you're inside...

47:51.935 --> 47:54.301
because you're always inside your head.

47:54.404 --> 47:56.304
- Do you follow that?
- Yes.

47:56.406 --> 47:59.534
Sometimes when I'm sitting here,
I turn the lights off, sit in the dark.

47:59.643 --> 48:02.737
That always makes me feel
like I'm sitting outside.

48:02.846 --> 48:05.474
So, what do you do with yourself 
here every nighttime?

48:05.582 --> 48:07.982
I read, and I think.

48:08.085 --> 48:10.315
<i>What do you think about?</i>

48:10.420 --> 48:12.547
- I think about my life.
- And is that horrendous for you?

48:12.656 --> 48:14.317
No, certainly not.

48:14.424 --> 48:18.360
Is it horrendous for your wife?
Are you married, mate?

48:18.462 --> 48:20.726
Well, technically I'm married...

48:20.831 --> 48:25.165
although my wife is 5,919 miles away
and I haven't seen her for 13 years.

48:25.269 --> 48:27.999
It's all going very well then?
Where is she?

48:28.105 --> 48:30.073
- She's in Bangkok.
- Saucy.

48:34.311 --> 48:37.610
- They're not worth it, are they?
- <i>Whores and harlots.</i>

48:38.782 --> 48:40.875
When was the last time you had a fuck?

48:43.587 --> 48:45.646
Is that an embarrassing question for you?

48:45.756 --> 48:48.486
It is, rather. Yes.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.526
I'm sorry.

48:52.796 --> 48:54.696
Step this way.

48:54.798 --> 48:57.596
I want to reveal to you
the mysteries of my trade.

49:01.738 --> 49:05.071
- What do you think that is?
- A, uh, Dadaist nun?

49:05.175 --> 49:08.975
Wrong. This little lady 
is the representative of my employer.

49:09.079 --> 49:11.513
- How do you do, love?
- Watch.

49:11.615 --> 49:15.244
Very Zen.

49:15.352 --> 49:20.790
My existence at this moment, on this spot,
is now trapped and recorded.

49:20.891 --> 49:24.588
Twenty-three moments, 23 sites,
every two hours.

49:24.695 --> 49:27.061
That's my job.

49:27.164 --> 49:29.860
Well, could they not train
a tall chimpanzee to do that?

49:29.967 --> 49:33.425
Or a small chimpanzee
with a bigger gizmo?

49:33.537 --> 49:35.664
I expect they could, yes.

49:35.772 --> 49:38.138
- What's your name, son?
- Brian.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.209
Hello, Brian. Johnny.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.244
Well, Brian, congratulations.

49:42.346 --> 49:45.975
You succeeded in convincing me that you
do have the most tedious fucking job...

49:46.083 --> 49:48.051
in England.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.287
Come on.

50:02.065 --> 50:05.796
- Yes, it is a boring job. Bloody boring, actually.
- All right, all right.

50:05.902 --> 50:10.100
But all you can see is the tip of the iceberg,
the present, the tedious here and now.

50:10.207 --> 50:14.268
What you're incapable of seeing is 
the rest of time, the rest of the iceberg -

50:14.378 --> 50:16.972
past and the future, my future...

50:17.080 --> 50:19.640
which is a very interesting place to be.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.945
The good thing about this job
is that it gives me time and space...

50:22.052 --> 50:25.488
to contemplate the future at my leisure,
whilst the city sleeps...

50:25.589 --> 50:29.582
free from the cacophonous curiosity
of the hoi polloi.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.161
So, you see, it's not a boring job.

50:33.397 --> 50:35.490
And I'm not boring either.

50:35.599 --> 50:39.729
- Am I allowed to smoke on the stairs?
- <i>No. There's alarms all over the building.</i>

50:41.104 --> 50:44.403
So you think you can make the present palatable
by projecting into the future?

50:44.508 --> 50:47.807
You're living in the past, pal.
It's the future that fucks you up, Brian.

50:47.911 --> 50:49.970
It's the maggot in the apple.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.548
See, you're all pissed off
with the present, Bri...

50:52.649 --> 50:54.549
and there's nothing wrong
with the present.

50:54.651 --> 50:58.109
The present's fine. The present's perfect.
The present's peachy fucking creamy.

50:58.221 --> 51:01.679
The only thing wrong with the present
is the bastard doesn't exist...

51:01.792 --> 51:04.590
because the present is the future,
and the future is the past...

51:04.694 --> 51:06.992
and it's all the same
fucking bag of bones anyway.

51:07.097 --> 51:09.565
It's a constant process
of coming into being and passing away...

51:09.666 --> 51:11.566
coming into being and passing away.

51:11.668 --> 51:14.796
- The future is now.
- But the present does exist. We're in it now.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.306
You were just then, when you said it, but you're not 
in it now, you're not in it now, you're not in it now. 

51:18.408 --> 51:21.172
You're forever being kicked up the ass
by the future. You with me?

51:21.278 --> 51:23.212
That's what I mean.

51:23.313 --> 51:26.282
See, I'm in the present,
but I'm not in the present.

51:26.383 --> 51:28.647
I'm in the future.

51:28.752 --> 51:31.016
Exactly.

51:31.121 --> 51:35.421
Has nobody not told you, Brian, that you've got
this kind of gleeful preoccupation with the future?

51:35.525 --> 51:37.823
I wouldn't even mind,
but you don't even have a fucking future.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.123
I don't have a future.
Nobody has a future.

51:40.230 --> 51:44.030
The party's over. Take a look around you, man.
It's all breaking up.

51:44.134 --> 51:46.762
Are you not familiar with the 
Book of Revelations of Saint John...

51:46.870 --> 51:49.168
the final book of the Bible
prophesying the Apocalypse?

51:49.272 --> 51:51.365
Yes, as it happens, I'm familiar
with all the books of the Bible.

51:51.475 --> 51:55.571
I'm very happy for you. "He forced everyone
to receive a mark on his right hand...

51:55.679 --> 51:58.876
"or on his forehead so that no one
shall be able to buy or sell...

51:58.982 --> 52:01.280
"unless he has the mark,
which is the name of the beast...

52:01.384 --> 52:03.852
or the number of his name,
and the number of the beast is 666."

52:03.954 --> 52:05.922
- 666! I know about it.
- Great.

52:06.022 --> 52:09.287
I know about Nostradamus.
Nostradamus talked about three brothers.

52:09.392 --> 52:13.920
Did he mean the Kennedy brothers or was he talking 
about three bits of the Soviet Union?

52:14.030 --> 52:16.498
- You see? You just can't tell.
- Fuck Nostradamus!

52:16.600 --> 52:20.195
I'm not talking about Nostradamus or Mother Shipton 
or Russell Grant or Mystic-fucking-Meg.

52:20.303 --> 52:23.204
I'm talking about the holy fucking book!

52:23.306 --> 52:27.003
What can such a specific prophecy mean?

52:27.110 --> 52:29.544
What is the mark?

52:29.646 --> 52:33.343
Well, the mark, Brian, is the bar code,
the ubiquitous bar code...

52:33.450 --> 52:35.782
that you'll find on every bog roll
and every packet of johnnies...

52:35.886 --> 52:37.786
and every poxy pork pie.

52:37.888 --> 52:41.517
And every fucking bar code is divided
into two parts by three markers.

52:41.625 --> 52:44.890
And those three markers are always represented 
by the number six.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.259
Six, six, six.

52:47.364 --> 52:52.267
Now, what does it say? "No one shall be able
to buy or sell without that mark."

52:52.369 --> 52:56.169
And now, what they're planning to do
in order to eradicate all credit card fraud...

52:56.273 --> 52:59.242
and in order to precipitate
a totally cashless society...

52:59.342 --> 53:02.311
what they're planning to do, 
what they've already tested on the American troops...

53:02.412 --> 53:06.974
they're gonna subcutaneously laser-tattoo 
that mark onto your right hand or forehead.

53:07.083 --> 53:09.210
They're gonna replace plastic with flesh.

53:09.319 --> 53:10.809
Fact!

53:10.921 --> 53:14.288
In the same Book of Revelations,
when the seven seals are broken open...

53:14.391 --> 53:17.019
on the Day of Judgment
and the seven angels blow the trumpets...

53:17.127 --> 53:20.893
when the third angel blows her bugle,
wormwood will fall from the sky...

53:20.997 --> 53:23.795
wormwood will poison a third part 
of all the waters...

53:23.900 --> 53:26.994
and a third part of all the land,
and many, many, many people will die.

53:27.103 --> 53:30.800
Now, do you know what 
the Russian translation for "wormwood" is?

53:30.907 --> 53:32.841
- No.
- Chernobyl.

53:32.943 --> 53:34.410
Fact!

53:34.511 --> 53:37.139
On August the 18th, 1999...

53:37.247 --> 53:40.705
the planets of our solar system
are gonna line up into the shape of a cross.

53:40.817 --> 53:43.285
- I don't believe in astrology.
- I'm not talking about astrology!

53:43.386 --> 53:45.286
I'm talking about astronomy.

53:45.388 --> 53:49.188
They're gonna line up in the fixed signs
of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus and Scorpio...

53:49.292 --> 53:52.750
which just happen to correspond
to the four beasts of the Apocalypse...

53:52.862 --> 53:54.762
as mentioned in the Book of Daniel.

53:54.864 --> 53:56.764
Another fucking fact!

53:56.866 --> 53:59.892
Do you want me to go on?
The end of the world is nigh, Bri.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.971
The game is up!

54:03.573 --> 54:05.939
I don't believe that.

54:06.042 --> 54:08.510
Life can't just come to a stop.

54:13.783 --> 54:16.251
All right, I'm not saying
that life will end...

54:16.353 --> 54:19.345
or the world will end
or the universe will cease to exist...

54:19.456 --> 54:21.356
but man will cease to exist.

54:21.458 --> 54:24.894
Just like the dinosaurs passed into extinction,
the same thing will happen to us.

54:24.995 --> 54:28.556
We're not fucking important.
We're just a crap idea.

54:28.665 --> 54:31.031
I'm not gonna cease to exist.

54:31.134 --> 54:33.227
I'm gonna be here in the future.

54:33.336 --> 54:36.931
What is this fucking fixation
with the future?

54:37.040 --> 54:40.009
Listen, pal,
I've got chronic systolic palpitations...

54:40.110 --> 54:42.135
and acute fucking neuralgia.

54:42.245 --> 54:45.112
- What about these toilets? Can I smoke in here?
- <i>No, you fucking can't!</i>

54:46.850 --> 54:48.875
- Let me ask you a question.
- What?

54:48.985 --> 54:51.613
Have you ever had the sense that you've lived 
in a time different from this one?

54:51.721 --> 54:53.689
- What, you mean, like, in a past life?
- Could be, yeah.

54:53.790 --> 54:56.759
- Well, in my past life, I was dead.
- Ah, well, you see, I wasn't.

54:56.860 --> 54:59.829
I know I was here in the past,
before I was born.

54:59.929 --> 55:02.557
So I know I'm gonna be here
in the future, after I've died.

55:02.666 --> 55:07.968
I see. And in this alternative existence,
did you still have the same noxious body odor?

55:08.071 --> 55:10.699
There's no need to be personal.
It's what I believe.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.934
- Shall I tell you what I believe?
- You don't believe in anything.

55:13.043 --> 55:15.477
- Oh, I do, Brian.
- Yeah? What do you believe?

55:15.578 --> 55:19.742
Do you think that the amoeba ever dreamed
that it would evolve into the frog?

55:19.849 --> 55:21.749
Of course it didn't.

55:21.851 --> 55:25.150
And when that first frog shimmied out 
of the water and employed its vocal cords...

55:25.255 --> 55:28.224
in order to attract a mate
or to retard a predator...

55:28.325 --> 55:31.123
do you think that that frog ever imagined
that that incipient croak...

55:31.227 --> 55:34.390
would evolve into all the languages of the world,
into all the literature of the world?

55:34.497 --> 55:36.397
Of course it fucking didn't.

55:36.499 --> 55:40.060
And just as that froggy could never possibly 
have conceived of Shakespeare...

55:40.170 --> 55:43.003
so we can never possibly 
imagine our destiny.

55:43.106 --> 55:45.734
I know what my destiny is.

55:45.842 --> 55:48.811
Yeah, but what you're experiencing,
as far as I can gather...

55:48.912 --> 55:52.279
with all these manifestations of, uh, 
regression and precognition...

55:52.382 --> 55:55.351
and transmigratory astral 
fucking chatterings...

55:55.452 --> 55:58.910
is just the equivalent
of that first primeval grunt...

55:59.022 --> 56:01.149
because evolution isn't over.

56:01.257 --> 56:04.556
Man isn't the be-all
and fucking end-all.

56:06.062 --> 56:09.429
<i>Look, if you take the whole of time,
represented by one year...</i>

56:09.532 --> 56:12.228
we're only in the first few moments
of the first of January.

56:12.335 --> 56:14.303
There's a long way to go.

56:14.404 --> 56:17.134
Only now we're not gonna sprout
extra limbs and wings and fins...

56:17.240 --> 56:19.538
because evolution itself is evolving.

56:19.642 --> 56:23.442
And whereas you, through some process
of extrasensory recall...

56:23.546 --> 56:27.175
might imagine that you were some -
I don't know - some 17th-century Dutch girl...

56:27.283 --> 56:29.251
living in a windmill in old Amsterdam...

56:29.352 --> 56:33.550
one day you'll realize that you've had not
just one or two past or future existences...

56:33.656 --> 56:37.490
but that you were, and are, everybody
and everything that has ever been...

56:37.594 --> 56:40.062
or will ever be.

56:40.163 --> 56:42.723
Hang on a minute.
You just contradicted yourself.

56:42.832 --> 56:44.732
Oh, how'd you make that out?

56:44.834 --> 56:48.031
Downstairs you were predicting the end of the world.
Now you're talking about the future.

56:48.138 --> 56:50.834
- How do you explain that, eh?
- Easy.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.204
When it comes,
the Apocalypse itself...

56:53.309 --> 56:56.938
will be part of the process
of that leap of evolution.

56:57.046 --> 56:59.674
Yeah. Well, whatever happens...

56:59.783 --> 57:02.251
mankind will not cease to exist.

57:02.352 --> 57:06.618
He must. By the very definition of apocalypse,
mankind must cease to exist...

57:06.723 --> 57:08.816
at least in a material form.

57:08.925 --> 57:10.825
What do you mean,
"in a material form"?

57:10.927 --> 57:12.895
- Well, he'll evolve.
- What into?

57:12.996 --> 57:15.521
Into something that transcends matter.

57:15.632 --> 57:18.294
Into a species of pure thought.
Are you with me?

57:18.401 --> 57:20.528
Yeah. Like a ghost.

57:20.637 --> 57:23.606
No, not like a fucking ghost,
you big girl's blouse!

57:23.706 --> 57:26.334
Into something that's, like,
well beyond our comprehension.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.411
Into a universal consciousness.

57:28.511 --> 57:32.003
Into God, who is, 
by the same principle...

57:32.115 --> 57:34.743
that time is.

57:34.851 --> 57:39.117
- You don't believe in God.
- Of course I believe in God.

57:42.258 --> 57:44.726
You see, the thing is, Brian...

57:45.962 --> 57:48.294
that God is a hateful god.

57:49.866 --> 57:51.766
Must be...

57:51.868 --> 57:55.565
because if God is good,
then why is there evil in the world?

57:55.672 --> 57:59.199
Why is there pain and hate
and greed and war?

58:00.543 --> 58:02.511
Doesn't make sense.

58:04.380 --> 58:07.975
But if God is a nasty bastard, then you can say,
"Why is there good in the world?

58:08.084 --> 58:10.951
Why is there love and hope and joy?"

58:13.122 --> 58:17.650
Well, let's face it. Good exists
in order to be fucked up by evil.

58:17.760 --> 58:20.991
The very existence of good
enables evil to flourish.

58:21.097 --> 58:23.725
Therefore, God is bad.

58:25.134 --> 58:28.035
And it doesn't matter how many past
or future existences you have...

58:28.137 --> 58:31.800
because they're all gonna be riddled
with grief and anguish...

58:31.908 --> 58:33.876
and sickness and death.

58:36.012 --> 58:38.344
You see, Brian, God doesn't love you.

58:39.382 --> 58:41.976
God despises you.

58:42.085 --> 58:44.053
So there's no hope...

58:45.321 --> 58:48.085
and mankind is just 
a component of the device...

58:48.191 --> 58:51.092
by which the devil creates itself.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.162
Are you with me?

58:55.365 --> 58:57.299
You see, what I'm saying, 
basically, is...

58:57.400 --> 58:59.868
you can't make an omelet
without cracking a few eggs...

58:59.969 --> 59:02.335
and humanity is just a cracked egg...

59:02.438 --> 59:05.896
and the omelet... stinks.

59:14.183 --> 59:16.617
Yeah.

59:35.004 --> 59:38.030
Oh. And what's through 
the round window?

59:43.346 --> 59:47.248
- Who's that?
- Good question.

59:47.350 --> 59:49.648
Have you seen her before?

59:49.752 --> 59:52.220
Oh, yeah.
She's there every night.

59:54.223 --> 59:57.818
- Good-looking young girl, isn't she?
- She's all right.

59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.157
Does she ever have fellas up there?

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.163
No.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:06.468
Have you ever seen her, like,
you know, totally naked?

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.905
Once.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:14.075
What's she up to, eh?

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:17.203
I mean, what's her game,
taunting people in the middle of the night, eh?

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:22.314
<i>She probably gets a kick out of it,
like you get a kick out of watching her.</i> 

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:25.444
- <i>I'm doing no such thing.</i>
- <i>Well, I am.</i>

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.523
Have you got a hard-on?

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:31.525
No, I haven't, as a matter of fact.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.096
You wouldn't tell me if you had,
would you?

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.324
No, I don't think I would.

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.904
- Did you make these yourself?
- I did, yeah.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.906
I thought so.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:48.273
Well, listen, I might be back
in a couple of minutes.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.176
Be good.
If you can't be good, be careful.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.147
- And other clichés.
- Yeah.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.708
Well, tatty-bye, Bri.

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.756
Yes.

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:17.129
Charles? What?

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.908
Hello?

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.573
What the fuck's going on?
Where the bloody hell's Dorfman?

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.481
<i>The bastard's cost me 30 grand already.</i>

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:36.358
Fuck!

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.552
Sorry about that.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.438
Oh, I'm sorry, love.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:52.372
That's not you on the top floor,
is it, dancin'?

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.375
Yeah. Why?

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.708
Oh, right.
Um, you're a lovely mover.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.074
<i>I'm sorry, pet.
I'm, uh, freaking you out.</i>

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.813
- Where's Bhapu?
- Bhapu?

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.719
- It's cold.
- <i>Listen, I'd better explain meself.</i>

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.292
<i>You see, me brother's working
as an "insecurity" guard...</i>

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.885
in that fucking monstrosity round the back,
and we can see straight into your room.

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:17.227
<i>It's very nice.</i>

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:20.200
Anyway, he's got his boss coming round,
so he's told me to schlep round the streets...

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:23.329
<i>for a couple of hours, and I said I'd come
and say hello to Isadora Duncan...</i>

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.737
<i>keep you company.</i>

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:29.243
I know it's a bit cheeky, but, uh, 
I'm a cheeky young monkey.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.012
- Do you want to come in?
- Is that all right?

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.218
Hmm. How long have you been growing that?

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:49.298
- About two inches.
- Hmm. It's nice.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:53.028
You've had a few, haven't you, love?

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:56.105
- Do you want to come in?
- Thought you'd never ask.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:10.247
- Am I allowed to smoke in here?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.947
Thank Christ for that.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:15.023
Do you want a drink?

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:18.925
- Mmm.
- I think I better have, don't you?

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.895
Got a bit of fucking catching up to do, huh?

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.230
Here's to the monarchy.

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.297
What's funny?

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.372
I'm not laughing.

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.242
So do you live here on your own, yeah?

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:38.639
Is this what you're reading?

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.478
Jane Austen by <i>Emma.</i>

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:44.382
- It's my favorite book.
- Is it really?

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.490
I don't read much myself.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:00.033
You from Ireland?

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:03.663
No. Why?

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.199
What's that, a damp patch?

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.444
Oh.

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:14.546
I never noticed that before.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:34.368
How's it going inside there?

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:38.032
Mmm. Baby.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.475
Baby.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.628
How old are you, love?

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:06.029
It's funny, 'cause from over there,
you look a lot younger.

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.565
<i>I think me big brother's
quite taken with you.</i>

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:12.334
He's up there every night,
having a bit of a wank about you.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:15.239
Are you with me?

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.292
What's the matter?

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.663
Don't do that.

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.860
What, that?

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.437
Or that?

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.741
Don't you like that?

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:23.011
You don't have to hurt me.

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.578
I'm sorry.

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:42.915
Bite me.

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.496
Fucking bite me.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.926
- Come on.
- Hey!

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:54.002
Hey! Hey!

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.591
Who's this?

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.629
Who's this?

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:03.435
Please, will you?

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:39.363
I can't, love.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.145
You look like me mother.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:02.364
<i>Think you can recapture your youth 
by fuckin' it?</i>

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:08.365
You don't wanna fuck me.
You'll catch something cruel.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.831
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.333
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.836
Well, I was over here, like this,
but that didn't really work for me...

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.839
so I thought I'd try over here.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.842
But I don't think there's much future 
in this one either.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:25.004
Fuckin' hell.
Have you got any suggestions?

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.844
- Nope.
- So what do you do now?

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.317
- I'm gonna get some breakfast.
- Yeah, I could do with something to eat.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.820
- Can I come with ya?
- Have you got any money?

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:36.823
- Nope.
- Well, how are you gonna pay for it?

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.825
I'm not.

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:41.953
Well, I'm hungry.

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:47.991
- Did you have to go and beat her up?
- I never beat her up.

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:53.299
- You shagged her though?
- No.

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:03.184
<i>You don't believe me, do you?</i>

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.217
- She's older than you.
- Bollocks.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.292
Poached egg.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:16.128
That skirt's a bit short, innit, love?
It's disgraceful.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:27.297
- What's this?
- That's where I'm gonna live.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.112
Where is it?

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.181
<i>Ireland.</i>

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:35.682
I've lived in that cottage before.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.752
What, in one of your past lives?

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.951
Yes, as a matter of fact.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.994
Fuckin' shit-hole, innit?

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.494
- Don't waste your life.
- What?

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:56.833
Don't waste your life.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.217
- What time does this place close?
- 4:00.

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:18.487
Uh, listen, can you tell me
where I can get something to eat round here?

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.494
What?

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.496
- You've got a very nice smile.
- Have I?

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.225
Oh, yeah.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.679
Sorry, sir.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.623
I'll take that, sir.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.461
Your lady companion is joining you, sir?

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:33.128
Uh, no, she can't make it today, pal.
The old sciatica's playing up and everything.

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.567
- <i>You know?</i>
- Come on.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.796
What?

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.777
- Out of the car.
- Well, I've only just got in the car.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.641
Get out of the fucking car!

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:48.238
All right, Parker.
Keep your hat on.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:01.326
Well, that was lovely.
Thank you.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.557
Keep in touch.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.225
Oh, fuck.

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:42.028
- Who are you?
- Sebastian Hawks.

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:44.037
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:46.039
Um, what you doin' here?

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.439
- I'm an acquaintance of Sandra's.
- Oh, yeah?

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:52.446
- I just popped round to say hello.
- Well, Sandra's away at the moment, actually.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.448
Really.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.451
I hope you don't mind,
but I helped myself to a beer.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:01.250
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that your champagne and all?

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:06.721
- You like champagne, do you?
- Yeah. I do, as it happens.

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.853
This is a very nice flat.
Don't you think?

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.125
How did you get in here?

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.292
Tell me, do you have any problems
with the central heating?

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.892
Oh, are you the plumber?

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:17.164
Let's just say I've got
a vested interest in the property.

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:19.832
Fuckin' hell.
You're the landlord.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:23.639
- I'd rather you thought of me as a friend.
- Oh, shit.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.839
<i>What, is Sandra behind on the rent 
or something?</i>

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.076
Was your tattoo painful?

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.651
Yeah.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.152
Good.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.191
You're very beautiful, aren't you?

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:39.817
Am I?

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:43.591
In a quirky sort of way.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.601
- Are you a nurse?
- Yeah.

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.603
Psychiatric.

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.405
These are a very fetching
pair of tights.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.343
Oh, you like them, do ya,
Mr. Landlord?

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.348
Can we have that champagne now, please?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.044
Did you buy them like this,
or are the holes self-inflicted?

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:07.849
Nah. A spider spun them,
and that's where he had a tea break.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.853
Fucking hell!
That's a bit excessive, innit?

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.861
- I rather like this belt too.
- Oh, God.

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:18.399
Here we go.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.036
- Excuse me. Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going home.

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:25.038
- What, you're leaving me?
- Yeah.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.041
I've come all this way to see you,
and you're going. I can't believe it.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:31.044
- I'm stunned. I'm flabbergasted.
- So we'll get you a tissue.

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:33.774
Sounds promising.
Do you live nearby?

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:37.045
- I might do.
- I mean, is it within walking distance?

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.917
No, 'cause, you see, I've got this fascination
with all things peripatetic.

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:46.790
- See ya.
- Cheeky, aren't I?

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.598
Have you stolen the tea cozy?

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.363
Love, people can see you wearing that thing.
You're not embarrassed? No?

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.826
Don't give up.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.828
Oh! Oww!

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.439
Put this on.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.441
Oh, what?

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.943
Gonna play doctors and nurses now,
are we?

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:39.673
Hurry up.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.014
Oh, this is ridiculous.

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:53.356
Listen, I'm really sorry, right,
but I've had a bit of a rough week...

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.488
and I just don't think
I can go through with this.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:19:00.034
No!

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:02.535
Oh, you fucker!

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:05.538
Fuck off! Leave me alone!

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.304
Oh, don't!

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.380
You bastard!

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:19.620
Do you want some beans?

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.886
Yeah, cheers.

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:27.393
So, what would you be doing now
if I wasn't here?

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.396
Don't know.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:32.023
Having a shower, relaxing.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.034
I could do with a shower meself.

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:37.697
I haven't washed for about a week,
as you've probably noticed.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.206
You can have one if you like.

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.435
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:45.446
Bathroom's just here.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.040
Fuckin' hell.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.449
What did I do to deserve you, love?

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.387
<i>Just press this button.</i>

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.459
Now, listen...

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:03.691
you're not gonna creep up on me with a big knife,
dressed up as your mother, are you?

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.426
No.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.774
But it looks like you already 
are dressed up as your mother.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:29.020
Can I have me bag?
It's got me duck in it.

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.423
Ta.

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.791
Oh, dear.

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:15.534
<i>Who lives here, then? Zeus?</i>

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.098
- Is all this stuff yours?
- No.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:25.976
All these pseudo Doric midgets
with their novelty underpants.

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.982
Oh, look at this one,
touching time with a barge pole.

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:31.052
I wouldn't.

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:37.383
Is he a Homer-sexual, yeah?

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.722
What do you think?

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.296
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- They're in America.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:44.763
- They?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:47.198
- When are they gettin' back?
- <i>Don't know.</i>

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.630
And they're just letting you
stop here for nothing?

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.401
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:56.409
- I don't know them.
- I don't know.

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:59.844
- I find all this a bit sad.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.610
No, I don't mean that
to sound Homer-phobic.

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:05.049
I mean, I like <i>The Iliad.</i>

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.747
And <i>The Odyssey.</i>
Did you get that?

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.323
No.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:15.859
<i>So, have you read 
many of these books?</i>

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:18.228
No, I haven't.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.801
<i>Oh. I've read quite a few.</i>

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.694
<i>Oh, look!
Do you get it now?</i>

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.434
Do you know this?

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:32.206
<i>I bet you do. You've most likely done it 
at school. You just can't remember.</i>

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:36.045
<i>You know, like, uh, Achilles heel,
the wooden horse, Helen of Troy.</i>

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:38.381
- You know them?
- Yeah.

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:41.751
Yeah, well, that's all it is.
Good stuff.

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.687
Cyclops.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.692
Oh, hello.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.853
It's, uh, pizza delivery man.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.666
Do you want those beans?

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.363
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.838
Sebastian Hawks.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.908
Good evening.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:37.608
Very nice to meet you, Louise.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.805
Very nice to meet you.

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.882
I've heard a lot about you.

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.349
- Sophie?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.358
<i>Yeah, I'm in here.</i>

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.021
- Oh. You all right?
- I've never been better.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:59.032
<i>We've had a very interesting afternoon.
Haven't we, Sophie?</i>

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:01.034
<i>It's been fascinating.</i>

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:17.116
For services rendered.

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:19.709
Fuck off.

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:25.417
- Who's your friend?
- He's the landlord, isn't he?

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.722
- Whose landlord?
- Our fucking landlord.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:30.127
- Oh, get out of town.
- Ask him.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:36.234
- What you wearin' Sandra's uniform for?
- I don't wanna talk about it. All right?

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.803
- You want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.304
So, have you been sittin' 
on his face all afternoon?

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:49.542
- I don't need this.
- Jesus Christ.

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:53.348
I get home from work, all I wanna do
is put my feet up and watch the telly...

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.480
not get involved in one of your orgies.

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.558
Do you know what I mean?

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.664
<i>What happened to your arm?</i>

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:09.562
Sophie, what's been going on?

01:25:11.775 --> 01:25:14.674
- Have you put the kettle on?
- Yeah.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.267
Any chance of a coffee, Louise?

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.346
Yeah. Sure.

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:24.745
- These are a very nice pair of shorts.
- Would you take your hands off me, please?

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.687
I apologize.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:34.323
Right, pal. Here's your clothes.
Get your kit on and sling your hook.

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.693
Here's your shoes, mate.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.065
Hope I haven't given you AIDS, Sophie.

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.968
- Jesus Christ!
- Fucking hell! Are you serious?

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.065
- Merely jesting.
- Very funny.

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:50.644
Mind you, I think AIDS is rather healthy, 
in its way.

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:53.873
- You what?
- I realize that's not the fashionable thing to say.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.917
- No, it's not.
- But the world is overcrowded, isn't it?

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:59.782
- Could do with a bit of pruning.
- You fucking better be joking.

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:02.083
You're not going to have children,
are you, Louise?

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:04.090
I might do one day.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.251
I loathe children, I must say.

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:09.330
I bet they're not too keen on you neither.

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.298
I'm sure you like fucking.
Don't you, Louise?

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.630
- Are you going?
- I'm rather enjoying myself, actually.

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.795
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- That's a pity.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:21.308
You may be the landlord from hell, but that 
doesn't give you the right to lie on our couch.

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:25.105
- Whose couch?
- Do you want me to phone the police?

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.477
Be my guest.

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:30.210
Right.

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:37.080
- Listen, I can't have them in here.
- Why not?

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:41.128
They're gonna look at him in his suit, look at us, 
and who do you think they're gonna believe?

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:43.424
There's fucking dope all over the place.

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:46.022
Well, we're just winding him up.
He's loving this.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.102
What are we gonna do?

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:55.109
It's very peaceful here, innit?

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:58.579
Suppose so.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.441
Are you warm enough?

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.519
Yeah, it's nice. Thanks.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:10.191
It's funny, 'cause the silence
usually freaks me out.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:14.457
You start to pick up on all the small sounds.
You know what I mean?

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.894
<i>Like that clock.</i>

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.960
I hate that fucking clock.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.470
<i>Course you do. 
It's a clock.</i>

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:29.076
Is it all right
if I stay here tonight?

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.348
Have you ever had a dog?

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:39.446
No.

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:44.849
- I don't like dogs.
- Why?

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:47.325
Well, they're either vicious or daft.

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:50.197
- <i>Why? Have you?</i>
- Yeah.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.757
- Is it dead now?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:27:53.868 --> 01:27:55.768
Did you bury it?

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.134
Don't know.
Me dad took it.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.208
<i>And what about you?
Would you like to be buried or cremated?</i>

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.279
I couldn't give a shit.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:15.385
<i>I had this, uh, dream the other night
about these two skeletons havin' a fuck.</i>

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:18.254
Was a right bloody racket.
Woke me up.

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:20.259
Have you got a photo of your mum?

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.429
- What, on me?
- Yeah.

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.368
No.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.441
I think you might find one over 
at the news agent's, on the top shelf.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.112
Do you want some beans?

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.654
You've got a very sad face.

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:51.156
Have I?

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:54.319
<i>It's all right.
I mean, I find that attractive.</i>

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.390
But that's me.

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:03.470
<i>So, have you got a boyfriend 
or anything?</i>

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:16.350
What are you gonna do for Christmas?

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.454
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:25.559
You all right?

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:30.489
- What's the matter?
- Fuck off!

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.761
What's up, love?

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:05.527
- Is it something I said?
- I want you to go.

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:08.431
- Why?
- <i>Can you go, please?</i>

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:12.667
- Is it 'cause I don't like dogs?
- Get out!

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:16.744
- <i>Don't quite follow, love.</i>
- Just fuck off!

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:19.574
Oh. I see.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.910
Um -

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:24.041
Well, perhaps I was jumping to conclusions...

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:27.053
but I got the impression that I could
kip down on the sofa or something.

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.680
- Go!
- Go where?

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.692
Have you got any suggestions? 'Cause it's like 
a fucking Eskimo's grave out there.

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:35.058
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.858
All right, I'm going!

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:39.228
<i>Hey!</i>

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:30.475
It's not easy, is it?

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:35.656
Do you find that?

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.895
Well...

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.899
just goes to show ya...

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:49.799
<i>that no matter
how many books you read...</i>

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:53.237
<i>there's some things in this world
that you never, ever, ever, ever...</i>

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.970
ever fuckin' understand.

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:19.890
Oh, thank you for the tea
and the bath and the booze.

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.637
And the beans.

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:35.507
And listen, love, I hope that when
you're tucked up tonight all snug and warm...

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.982
underneath your tear-sodden fuckin' duvet...

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.019
and your ankle-length
Emily Brontë winding sheet...

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:43.682
that you spare a thought for me with me head 
in a puddle of cold dog's piss.

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:48.160
<i>And I hope that you dream about me.
And I hope that you wake up screamin'.</i>

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:52.664
And I hope that all your fuckin' children...

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:56.203
are born blind, bow-legged,
hare-lipped, homeless hunchbacks!

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.453
Have you ever had an abortion?

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:16.555
- Have you?
- No.

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:19.888
- I thought I was pregnant once.
- Would you have had one?

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:23.623
In the end, it turned out I wasn't,
and he left me anyway, so -

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:26.732
I wanted to keep mine.

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.734
What happened?

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:32.237
All my mates said
I couldn't look after a baby.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.240
Too fucking right.

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.902
Did it make you feel shitty?

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:39.241
It was a nightmare.

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.508
I really loved 'im.

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:45.951
- He was a philosopher.
- Where was this?

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.953
- Paris.
- Paris?

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:51.354
Should have seen the state
of his girlfriend.

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:55.756
Had one when I was 15 and all.

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.854
Jesus, Sophie.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:34:02.425
And that one was worse for my mum.
Fucking drama she made out of it.

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:08.974
I could have been married by now
with a four-year-old.

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:11.374
Do you wanna get married?

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.447
Don't know.

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:19.783
Just 'cause you have a kid with someone
doesn't mean they're gonna stick around.

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:23.288
My dad didn't.
Couldn't fucking wait to get out.

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:26.292
Well, I don't know
if I want to get married...

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.295
but I wouldn't say no
to a proper relationship.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.865
What is a proper relationship?

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:36.628
Living with someone who talks to ya
after they've bonked ya.

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:41.640
I don't know what they want from you
half the time.

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:46.145
What they start off liking you for,
they end up hating you for.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:49.774
Don't like you if you're strong.
Don't like you if you're weak.

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:53.376
Hate you if you're clever.
Hate you if you're stupid.

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:56.456
They don't know what they want.

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:04.322
You think that bastard's fucked off yet?

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.967
Yeah, he must have done by now.

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:48.207
Is this a stick-up?

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.711
- So you must get that all the time, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:54.440
Just got it again.

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:59.843
So, is this your job,
or a nice little hobby you've got for yourself?

01:35:59.954 --> 01:36:01.922
You're a lovely mover.

01:36:10.498 --> 01:36:12.398
- This your van, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.401
It's, like, uh, I don't know,
top of the range.

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:17.403
Very nice.

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:20.406
- Are you going up the road?
- You want a lift?

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:23.068
- That all right with ya?
- Yeah.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.077
Cheers.

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:28.580
It's just I been walkin' round the streets
all night. You know what I mean?

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:31.651
These fuckin' feet are on their last legs,
I'm tellin' ya.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:39.220
- So, how much do you earn for doin' this?
- It's none of your fuckin' business.

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:42.227
I mean, is the pay as substantial 
as, say, the wages of sin?

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:44.763
Know what I mean?
You with me?

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:48.492
Listen, captain, is it all right
if I have a go at doing this, yeah?

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:50.402
Oh! God love ya.

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:54.634
Or does it take, like, thousands of years
of state-subsidized government training...

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.642
to do this clobber, yeah?

01:36:56.744 --> 01:37:01.647
You gotta slap on, like, copious quantities
of the old industrial sputum there.

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.649
Beg your pardon.

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.652
It's a wonderful career opportunity for me.
You know what I mean?

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:10.053
- I'm gonna play the joker on this one.
- Shift -

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:12.557
- Very well - Aah!
- Shift out of the fucking way. 

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.891
No, I like Laurel and Hardy, although 
apparently they didn't get on in real life.

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.089
Another illusion shattered.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.128
Sorry about that, pal. It's just, I've had 
a lot of bad experience with walls, you know...

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:25.637
what with talking to them
and climbing them.

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:28.640
Me dad's driven me up a good few in his time.
You know what I mean?

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:31.643
But I think I've got a secret -
a saucy little secret.

01:37:31.745 --> 01:37:35.181
The solipsistic, sagacious little secret
is just, you got - you just gotta...

01:37:35.282 --> 01:37:37.182
bang your fuckin' head against 'em.

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:40.913
Just crack the old pate -
Are you with me?

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:44.457
Have you got it? And that's it.
That is the key to enlightenment, which is -

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:49.120
It's, like, that's why- that's why it's, like,
such a potent motif of civilization.

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:52.131
It's the wall - It's like
the Great Wall of China...

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:56.135
and the wall of Jericho
and the Berlin Wall and the wailing wall.

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:59.138
Now, you see, the Jews,
they've almost got it, haven't they?

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.368
A real rockin' and that, you know.
Just six inches away and they'll be there.

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:05.377
They'd have won the fucking race.
They'll be there. Are you with me?

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:08.380
What is all this, anyway?
What are you doin'? Cancel everything.

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:11.383
In the beginning was the word,
and the word was "canceled."

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:14.386
You get satisfaction out of this?
You think you're making a contribution?

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.922
You're, like, 
sort of publicly promulgating vacuities.

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.584
Are you with me?
Fuckin' hell!

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.755
That's it!
Blank it all out!

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:27.766
Blank it all out till you just atrophy
and die of fuckin' indifference!

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:30.769
Can I show you something, pal?
You see that at the top of your legs?

01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:34.204
That's your ass, right, and that's your 
fuckin' elbow. Do you wanna write it down or-

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:36.902
Oh!

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.911
Fuck. Ow.

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.913
Who's that supposed to be?
Me dad?

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:44.610
You wanna watch that, mate.
I've got a dicky sacrum here.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.185
Shit.

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:50.222
F- Uh, can you, uh, come back here?

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:52.224
Uh, did I upset ya?

01:38:56.163 --> 01:38:57.790
Mate!

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:01.357
You got me bag!

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:03.561
You fucking tosser!

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:06.139
You've got - Fuck!

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:11.369
Fuck!

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:14.379
All right, listen.
Does anybody mind if I scream here?

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:18.383
Is that okay with you all? 'Cause I'd feel 
better for it. It won't take long.

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.392
Fuck.

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.511
Who's that?

01:39:49.616 --> 01:39:51.516
Let's get him.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.588
Let's go. Fuck.

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.359
Let's do it.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.568
Who's that?

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:10.125
Oh, Jesus.

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.131
What's been happening to ya?

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:16.134
Will you shut up, for God's sake.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:24.509
- <i>Oww!</i>
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:27.011
Just give us a fag.

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.183
Fucking comedian.

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:40.158
It's not my fault.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.160
What's not your fault?

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.833
- Where are you going?
- I just want to go to bed.

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.835
Will you be quiet!

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:52.906
- I fuckin' walked here.
- Where from?

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:59.512
- <i>Which way?</i>
- Um - I'm gon -

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.240
<i>I'm gonna be sick.</i>

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:16.328
Fuckin' hell.
What's happened to him?

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.330
Don't know.

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:20.332
- Johnny. Are you all right, Johnny?
- Get off!

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.402
Shh!

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:29.001
- Is he still here?
- I don't know.

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:04.469
- Right. We'd better get him into bed.
- Yeah.

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:07.979
- You take that end, I'll take this end.
- Okay. Don't push me, right?

01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:10.208
I'm not pushin' ya.

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:15.150
- Careful. That's his bad leg.
- Well, what do you want me to do?

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:17.314
After three.

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:19.324
One, two, three.

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:22.657
I wanna go. I wanna go!

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.890
Johnny-

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:29.935
Johnny!

01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:13.545
I know.

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:16.207
I know you told me.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:22.748
<i>And... I'm not here yet!
I'm still wet.</i>

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:27.393
<i>What did she mean?</i>

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.757
Why not me brother?

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:39.635
Will it be quiet now? Yeah?

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.538
Are we going?

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:50.879
Oh, fuck. Shit.

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:08.266
- Who's this?
- It's all right. He's a friend of mine.

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:11.804
<i>What extraordinary friends you have.</i>

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:14.874
- <i>He's only got one sock on.</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.376
<i>You seem a bit tense, Sophie.
Would you like a massage?</i>

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:20.378
- <i>A d-d-doctor -</i>
- <i>Pardon?</i>

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.746
- <i>Is he the doctor?</i>
- <i>You're rather disgusting, aren't you?</i>

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:31.289
You're not crying, are you, Louise?

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:33.791
Oh, listen,
when are you gonna fuck off?

01:45:33.894 --> 01:45:37.455
This has got nothing to do with you. 
Right?

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:40.931
No! No! Stop!

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:43.594
Leave me alone!

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.672
Ow. Me leg.

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.970
<i>You don't know.</i>

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:50.907
Aren't people pathetic?

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:59.014
Right.
I'm going to beddy-byes.

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:09.062
If anyone wishes to join me,
I'll be under the duvet.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:19.170
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Are you?

01:46:19.272 --> 01:46:21.240
Yeah.

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:27.012
Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:29.412
I'm all right.
I walked here.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.665
Is it here?

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:57.744
Yeah.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:02.147
- Who's that?
- Clancy.

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:04.217
I thought so.

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:08.955
- I used to know you, didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:47:18.298 --> 01:47:20.892
<i>Take me back to Manchester</i>

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:24.903
<i>When it's raining</i>

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:27.371
<i>I want to wet me feet</i>

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:30.534
<i>In Albert Square</i>

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:33.044
<i>I'm all agog</i>

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:36.604
<i>For a good, thick fog</i>

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:38.911
<i>I don't like the sun</i>

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:42.614
<i>I like it raining cats and dogs</i>

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:45.247
<i>I want to smell the odors</i>

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:48.794
<i>Of the Irwell</i>

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:53.355
<i>I want to feel the soot
get in me hair</i>

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:57.165
<i>Oh, I don't want to roam</i>

01:47:57.270 --> 01:48:00.967
<i>I want to get back home</i>

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:05.568
<i>To rainy Manchester</i>

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.350
I've got an hard-on.

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.355
What's -

01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:28.359
What are you -

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.861
This is, uh -

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.864
It's disgusting!

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:35.161
<i>Nobody in my-</i>

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:37.498
Who's he?

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:40.232
Y-You've got your boots on it!

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.864
She's -

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:44.671
And what's this doing -

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:49.215
This is something I can't -

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:51.409
I don't -

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.713
It's not -

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:57.881
I just don't need all this...
palaver.

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.627
Oh, shit.

01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:15.907
Okay, who's Jeremy?

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:18.409
- Who's Jeremy?
- What do you mean?

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.411
Sandra.
What a nice surprise.

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.413
What are you doing here?

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:25.177
- How was Zimbabwe?
- Shift!

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:28.253
- Good morning, Louise.
- Where's Jeremy?

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:30.983
- Who's Jeremy?
- These are Jeremy's.

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:33.286
- That's Sebastian's.
- No, look.

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:36.794
"Jeremy Smart." "Jeremy Smart."
"Jeremy G. Smart."

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:39.797
Well, I've never heard of him.

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:42.299
Sebastian, who -

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.302
Are you Jeremy G. Smart?

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:46.304
<i>Are you?</i>

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:48.806
Johnny. Johnny, wake up.

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:51.069
- Leave him.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Sophie.

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:53.077
- Sandra's back.
- What day is it?

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:55.306
- It's Friday.
- Oh, fuck this.

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:57.315
- Look at his eye.
- Christ.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:00.318
He can lie down in my room -
Oh, God!

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.820
What are you doing?
He's not harming anyone.

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:06.289
- Have you seen the state of her? Johnny!
- I'm here, Johnny.

01:51:06.393 --> 01:51:07.951
Morning, everyone!

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:11.724
I would actually like to have some kind
of explanation for all this because -

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:14.129
- Having fun?
- Can you put these on, please?

01:51:14.234 --> 01:51:17.135
Sophie and I had a fuck on your bed
yesterday afternoon, Sandra.

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:19.137
- Oh, God.
- You are just...

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:21.434
- <i>She was very good, I must say.</i>
- Filth!

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:24.169
- Not as good as you though.
- You lying -

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:28.347
- Nastiness!
- We must do it again sometime.

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:35.019
Will you -

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:37.715
How can you -

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:40.122
Everything -

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:43.194
I can't cope with this.

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:45.196
<i>You've got five minutes.</i>

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:48.597
<i>Five minutes to get your things on
and get the hell ou-</i>

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:51.762
<i>I shouldn't worry about it so much 
if I were you.</i>

01:51:51.938 --> 01:51:55.203
I'd forgotten what a beautiful bottom
you've got, Sandra.

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:57.776
Two minutes.

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.915
Marvelous tits.

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:08.683
Listen, Sandra, I'm really sorry.
We weren't expecting you back.

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:11.188
I fail to - Why -

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.191
I-It's a pig sty! It's -

01:52:13.293 --> 01:52:15.853
- I know. It just got out of hand.
- Obviously!

01:52:15.962 --> 01:52:18.362
- A-And what's all that?
- He's a friend of mine.

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:22.196
- Can I make you a cup of tea?
- I don't want tea. I don't want -

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.532
I just want - My journey was -

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:27.057
- He's not very well!
- What's the matter with him?

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.270
He's got a lump on his face the size
of a boiled egg, and he won't wake up.

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:42.183
- Did he do this?
- Who?

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:45.553
- Sebasti - Jeremy!
- You never warned me about him, did ya?

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:49.059
- What are you talking about?
- Fucking letting himself in with the keys.

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.892
- Bastard!
- I don't -

01:52:51.998 --> 01:52:54.967
Right. Let's get this shoe off.

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:59.932
Have you ever had smoked salmon
after making love, Louise?

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:03.031
- Don't like smoked salmon.
- I think you should try it.

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:05.043
It's rather wonderful.

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:07.443
Will you undo your fly, Sebastian?

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:12.251
Would you like me to?

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:20.126
Honest.

01:53:42.148 --> 01:53:46.482
Oh, do you not want me to slice 
your prick off and shove it up your ass?

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:58.853
Maggot-dick.

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:11.776
- Could you pass me that pillow, please?
- Here you go.

01:54:11.878 --> 01:54:14.779
- I can't move, Sandra.
- You are worse than useless.

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:16.781
You all right?

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:19.784
- You don't think it's broken, do ya?
- No, he can move it.

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.855
- You can do that, can't you?
- Why would I want to do that?

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:26.187
Don't even -
Not in my room, Sophie!

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:28.624
- I need a fag.
- I don't care.

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:32.095
- Cop hold of that.
- Oh, just don't start, right?

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:36.464
It really is beyond me the way you girls 
choose to live your lives.

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:40.505
My mind just... boggles.

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:43.838
He's gone back to sleep.

01:54:44.878 --> 01:54:46.743
Was that the front door?

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.780
- He's gone.
- Thank God.

01:54:57.991 --> 01:54:59.891
Go slowly, Johnny.

01:54:59.993 --> 01:55:01.893
Now, what you two must do...

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:06.022
is take this one to Casualty and make sure
he gets himself looked at before he goes home.

01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:08.032
- Gonna be sick.
- Are you?

01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:11.035
- Get him into the bathroom.
- <i>All right! All right! Let's not-</i>

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:13.037
<i>Just a minute. That's it.</i>

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:15.403
<i>Make it steady.</i>

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:17.476
- <i>Here you are.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:20.135
It's in me tash.

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:22.408
You wanna get it cut.

01:55:26.185 --> 01:55:28.153
It's in your mouth.

01:55:29.656 --> 01:55:31.817
<i>Have you had a bath lately?</i>

01:55:31.925 --> 01:55:34.155
- <i>I had one yesterday.</i>
- <i>As if!</i>

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.194
- <i>I did.</i>
- Where have you been, Johnny?

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:39.732
Down the Via De La Rosa.
Don't be nosy.

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:43.734
- <i>You not going to work?</i>
- <i>I'm late.</i>

01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:47.101
- <i>Ah. You'll get the sack.</i>
- Yeah.

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:50.107
<i>It's all right.
You can put all your troubles in it.</i>

01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:53.770
- Hey, I lost me bag.
- <i>Yeah, I noticed. Where is it?</i>

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.246
- I don't know. It's lost.
- Any valuables?

01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:59.750
Yeah, it's got me collection 
of famous retired glove puppets in there.

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:02.013
<i>That's it. All gone.</i>

01:56:02.121 --> 01:56:04.385
Did you get it nicked?

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:08.392
Would you put that out?

01:56:21.975 --> 01:56:24.535
I haven't cleaned me teeth yet.

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:27.477
Could you not just put 'em
in a glass or something, no?

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:46.494
I remember when you bought these shorts.

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.794
I warned you about 'em then.

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.960
Yeah, well...

01:56:55.274 --> 01:56:58.300
- I only got 'em to piss you off.
- Mission accomplished.

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:04.171
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:12.286
What, is this a spectator sport or something?
The hundred-meter vomit?

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:21.158
Sophie, do you mind if I have
a word with Johnny on me own?

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:30.509
Do you want a word with Louise
on your own?

01:57:30.610 --> 01:57:32.874
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No.

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:36.505
Well, do as you're told.

01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:39.718
Right.

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:45.623
Whose is all this money?
Three hundred and eighty pounds.

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:49.525
It really oughtn't to be left laying,
waiting for-

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:03.375
- Whose is all that?
- Don't know.

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:12.244
Who's been playing ping-pong
with your face?

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:14.911
Sky fell in on me.

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:17.319
A cloud caught me across the cheek.

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:23.428
- So, why did you come to London?
- Come to run in the marathon.

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:25.724
Will you give me 
a straight answer, please?

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:31.329
Well, I had to get out of Manchester
'cause I was gonna get a beating...

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:35.168
and I come down here and, uh... 
get a beating.

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.333
- Were you asking for it?
- No.

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:39.502
I wasn't.
They just come out of nowhere.

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.910
- Honest?
- Yeah.

01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.847
- So, what you gonna do?
- What you gonna do?

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:52.254
What are you gonna do?

01:58:52.358 --> 01:58:54.952
Don't know.
Might go home for the weekend.

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.154
<i>Well, there's no place like it.</i>

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:59.231
Might not come back.

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:02.801
<i>Are you going back?</i>

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:10.175
Is that nice?

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:15.141
- Yeah.
- I'm puttin' the "fun" back in fundament.

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:17.239
Are ya?

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:21.946
- Well, I'll have to go back sometime, won't I?
- And what about us?

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:24.420
What about us?

01:59:29.128 --> 01:59:31.926
- Do ya hate me?
- Fuck off.

01:59:36.335 --> 01:59:38.769
My mum was seven years younger than you 
when she had me.

01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:39.517
- Don't.
- What?

01:59:39.511 --> 01:59:40.896
- Just - 

01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:45.405
Well, she was.

01:59:47.513 --> 01:59:49.504
- I'm full of shit, aren't I?
- Sometimes.

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:53.483
- <i>Well, I've had it all kicked out of me now.</i>
- Oh. Good.

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:59.156
What if God just put us here
for his own entertainment?

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:03.661
That's all we are - just something for him 
to have a bit of a laugh at.

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:05.424
<i>Could be, couldn't it...</i>

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:07.624
if you think about it?

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:13.330
Give us your right hand.

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:15.407
The other way up.

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:25.847
What's that?

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.484
- That's funny to me.
- You're daft, you.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:32.888
It's, uh, toilet humor.

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:39.360
Will you give me a cuddle, Johnny?

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:41.433
Yeah.

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:10.094
<i>What's the matter?</i>

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:13.165
<i>Can you not tell me?</i>

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:30.347
<i>If no one tells me what's going on,
then how am I supposed to-</i>

02:01:30.449 --> 02:01:32.349
I don't understand, Johnny!

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:34.885
- How was Zambia?
- It was Zimbabwe!

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:38.354
I went to Zimbabwe 
with my wanker boyfriend - my ex -

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:40.357
What did I do wrong?

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.359
Did you see any big animals?

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:46.898
Yes! We saw elephants and rhinos
and zebras and lions and vultures.

02:01:46.999 --> 02:01:49.399
- Did you see any monkeys?
- We saw many monkeys.

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:51.402
Were they cheeky?

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:53.904
It's not good for me, is it,
all this, in my condition?

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:57.840
Well, yes - No - Yes -
It's not good for me, it's not good for you.

02:01:57.943 --> 02:02:01.845
- It's not good for any of us! It's utterly-
- Oh, excuse me for living!

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:07.948
Is - Is this it, Johnny?

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:09.954
Is what it?

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:12.684
I can't bear it!

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:16.293
<i>Right. I'm off!</i>

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:18.295
Off your trolley.

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:22.458
Oh, don't fucking take the piss
out of me, you bastard!

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.468
You don't know!

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:28.631
All I want - 
Nobody has any-

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:31.141
<i>Can you just please try and-</i>

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:34.337
- <i>I've had enough! Oh, God!</i>
- <i>This is a nightmare!</i>

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:39.350
- If you could just try and pull yourself together-
- Where you going?

02:02:39.452 --> 02:02:42.353
- I don't know!
- Why don't you come and have a lie-down?

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:44.355
- I don't care!
- Sophie!

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:46.857
- Here's the keys!
- I don't want the keys.

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:51.055
- Well, I don't fucking want 'em!
- I'm not a social worker!

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:53.063
Sophie.

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:55.065
Don't be fucking stupid.

02:02:55.167 --> 02:02:57.658
What's the point, Louise?

02:02:57.770 --> 02:03:01.171
Sophie!

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:04.703
I'm sorry.

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:31.105
Johnny.

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:41.545
You all right?

02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:44.707
- Mmm?
- I'm going.

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:47.718
- Where?
- Work, to hand me notice in.

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:50.721
Then I'm coming back here 
and packing me bags and I'm going home.

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:53.087
- Do you want to come?
- Today?

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.420
- Yeah.
- You serious?

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.085
- Yeah.
- How?

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:57.822
Bus.

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:02.566
- Well, have you got enough dough?
- Yeah.

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:04.795
- 'Cause I've not got nothin'.
- I know.

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:10.407
Do you think you can make it?

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:12.136
Don't know.

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:16.978
Well, if you can't,
we can stay here till tomorrow.

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:30.829
I'll see you later.

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:34.759
Uh, can you leave us a few fags
for cancer research?

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.835
Here are your sh -

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:40.904
<i>I was actually hoping
that the air could-</i>

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:43.634
What are we gonna do about all this?

02:04:43.742 --> 02:04:45.642
I don't know, Sandra.

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:47.712
Look, I'll see you 
in a couple of hours.

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:50.043
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Uh, you will come back?

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:52.049
Yeah. Of course I will.

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:54.244
- Because I need -
- You'll be all right, won't ya?

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:58.653
- Will I be all right, love?
- I'm gonna get the bath cleaned.

02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:19.237
<i>You all know what it does to you...</i>

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:22.906
and yet you still insist on doing it,
so do it.

02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:25.449
Smoke yourself to...

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.451
Well, birds do it, bees do it.

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.919
High heaven.

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:31.922
<i>Can you tell me something, love?</i>

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:34.925
Is it true that some babies
are born covered in fur?

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:37.257
Up.

02:05:37.363 --> 02:05:39.263
Thank you.

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:42.266
And you know, at birth,
when you cut the umbilical cord...

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:45.769
<i>what would happen if, uh-
well, if it was never cut?</i>

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:48.840
I don't need this. I just -

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:51.637
Well, it'd be embarrassing, wouldn't it?
Especially at my age.

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:54.645
Why do you feel the need
to take the piss?

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.510
I'm not taking a piss.

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:59.311
- It's nice, that. Where is it from?
- I don't know.

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:01.113
It's something my dad -

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.484
<i>Now, you see, 
Sophie just turned that to the wall.</i>

02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:06.786
She's got this kind of
irritating proclivity for negation.

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.860
<i>Suppose she thinks
it's progressive or something.</i>

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:12.124
- What is your problem?
- Nothing. What's your problem?

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:15.462
All these silly questions and -

02:06:15.568 --> 02:06:19.629
Well, look, I've never met a nurse before,
and I'm just interested in, uh - well, in life.

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.002
<i>I mean, do you think it's worth savin'?</i>

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:24.007
Of course I do!

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:26.771
But there is a time and a place...

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:30.872
and, actually,
this isn't the time or-

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.743
- The place?
- No.

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:37.447
And this is where I -

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:39.751
- Live?
- Yes!

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:41.758
And I'm not feeling very-

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.487
- Sexy?
- Comfortable, actually.

02:06:43.596 --> 02:06:45.325
I'm not feeling very comfortable.

02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:48.992
Well, make yourself comfortable, love,
or slip into something more.

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:52.970
My bath -

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:58.203
Hot toast, hot milk,
hot water bottle, bed, sleep.

02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:00.801
- Do you like me?
- I don't know you.

02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:03.643
- So -
- <i>Do you find me attractive?</i>

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:07.451
Well, listen, love, it's like this -
I find you attractive.

02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:10.454
- Very attractive.
- Enough.

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.456
I've had enough.

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:16.892
It comes at me from all angles.

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:18.896
Y-You - All of you just -

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:21.023
I-It's the tin lids -

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:25.399
When - How will the world ever -

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.465
- End?
- Yes!
