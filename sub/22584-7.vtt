01:10.560 --> 01:11.629
Surak.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.835
It's been a long road

01:18.520 --> 01:20.351
Gettin' from there to here

01:21.680 --> 01:23.352
It's been a long time

01:25.200 --> 01:28.476
But my time is finally near

01:29.000 --> 01:32.595
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:33.280 --> 01:35.874
I will touch the sky

01:36.360 --> 01:39.830
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:40.320 --> 01:43.073
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:43.200 --> 01:46.954
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:47.760 --> 01:50.877
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:51.000 --> 01:54.834
I've got faith to believe

01:55.360 --> 01:58.113
I can do anything

01:58.240 --> 02:02.074
I've got strength of the soul

02:02.760 --> 02:05.274
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:05.400 --> 02:09.598
I can reach any star

02:11.039 --> 02:13.270
I've got faith

02:14.800 --> 02:17.598
I've got faith

02:18.400 --> 02:21.756
Faith of the heart

02:32.360 --> 02:35.079
Admiral Maxwell Forrest's
Personal Log.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.237
I've arrived on Vulcan hopeful that
the High Command is finally ready...

02:38.360 --> 02:40.112
to conduct joint missions with Starfleet.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.074
Admiral, the High Command will tell you
its decision at the proper time.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.870
After all we've been through,
I'd rather hear the good news from you.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.276
The High Command hasn't included me
in their discussions.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.470
They're not telling their own
Ambassador to Earth...

02:53.600 --> 02:55.079
what they're planning?

02:55.520 --> 02:56.919
Welcome to the club.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.429
Admiral,
I know you find our reluctance...

02:59.560 --> 03:02.472
to share technology
and discoveries restrictive.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.593
I can think of a few stronger words
than that.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.548
We don't know what to do
about humans.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.715
Of all the species
we've made contact with...

03:11.840 --> 03:14.115
yours is the only one we can't define.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.359
You have the arrogance of Andorians,
the stubborn pride of Tellarites.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.438
One moment you're as driven
by your emotions as Klingons...

03:21.560 --> 03:24.996
and the next, you confound us
by suddenly embracing logic.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.314
I'm sure those qualities
are found in every species.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.034
Not in such confusing abundance.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.074
Ambassador.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.190
Are Vulcans afraid of humans?

03:45.440 --> 03:46.395
Why?

03:46.520 --> 03:49.318
Because there is one species
you remind us of.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.675
Vulcans.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.912
We had our wars, Admiral,
just as humans did.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.316
Our planet was devastated,
our civilization nearly destroyed.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.873
Logic saved us.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.795
But it took almost 1,500 years for us
to rebuild our world...

04:05.920 --> 04:06.909
and travel to the stars.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.918
You humans did the same
in less than a century.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.676
There are those on the High Command
who wonder...

04:15.880 --> 04:18.872
what humans would achieve
in the century to come.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.950
And they don't like the answer.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.352
We're not the Klingons.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.670
We only want to be your partners.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.872
To do what the nations of Earth
have learnt to do.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.515
To work together in common cause.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.680
Unfortunately, the future of relations
between our worlds...

04:36.800 --> 04:38.392
is not mine to control.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.195
Captain!

04:56.880 --> 04:57.949
Here!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.309
That's another game. 21-to-2.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.193
-Time to switch sides again, Doctor.
-Certainly.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.356
This is a most enjoyable sport.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.119
Reminiscent of Octran fertility contests.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.832
Captain. I've just spoken
with Starfleet Command.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.595
Except we're fully clothed,
which is probably for the best.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.311
Captain's Starlog, supplemental:

05:37.440 --> 05:40.193
Enterprise has arrived at Vulcan
as ordered.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.791
Three days after the bombing of Earth's
embassy, the death toll stands at 43.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.033
And I have lost my friend,
Admiral Forrest.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.708
Vulcan authorities still have no lead
on who's responsible.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.319
I'm sorry to keep you from your family...

05:52.440 --> 05:54.715
but I'm going to need you
on the investigation full-time.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.831
That's where I prefer to be.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.713
Your mother
and husband will understand?

06:01.480 --> 06:04.313
My mother hasn't responded
to my communiquÃ©s.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.280
It's not unusual for her to become lost
in her work.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.757
As for my husband,
our arrangement remains unchanged.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.557
Captain Jonathan Archer.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.798
I regret we meet
under such tragic circumstances.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.151
I'd like to introduce Administrator V'Las.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.479
Administrator.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.754
I wasn't told to expect the head
of the High Command.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.031
Captain Archer,
all of Vulcan grieves with you today.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.635
Twelve Vulcans died in the blast,
Ambassador.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.479
To that end, this is Stel...

06:41.600 --> 06:44.353
Chief lnvestigator
of our Security Directorate.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.550
Captain, we now have suspects.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.828
Andorians?

06:53.160 --> 06:54.912
Why would they attack our embassy?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.793
To create conflict
between Earth and Vulcan.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.997
They do consider us allies
who stand against them.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.637
So far, we've done our best to remain
neutral, and the Andorians know that.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.799
They have nothing to gain
by attacking us.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.431
You have other suspects?

07:13.120 --> 07:14.439
Syrrannites.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.719
I've never heard of that species.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.270
Actually,
they're a small group of Vulcans.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.589
They follow a corrupted form
of Surak's teachings.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.072
Surak I've heard of.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.711
He's the father of Vulcan logic.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.796
Even after 1,800 years,
we consider him...

07:30.920 --> 07:32.911
the most important Vulcan
who ever lived.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.476
So why would these Syrrannites
want to attack our embassy?

07:36.600 --> 07:38.238
It's hardly an act of logic.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.715
They've been vocal about
their opposition to government...

07:40.840 --> 07:42.239
but always peaceful.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.677
Over the past year their leader,
a dissident named Syrran...

07:45.800 --> 07:47.597
has become a dangerous zealot.

07:47.720 --> 07:48.835
Captain.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.156
I trust you to keep
this matter confidential.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.316
We don't share it lightly.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.749
But recently on our world,
there have been...

07:55.880 --> 07:58.155
instances of violence
against non-Vulcans.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.956
Though we have no conclusive proof...

08:01.080 --> 08:04.356
there are signs that Syrrannites
might be responsible.

08:05.600 --> 08:09.149
Is there any evidence
connecting Syrrannites to the bombing?

08:10.600 --> 08:14.673
Your embassy is officially considered
to be on Earth soil.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.000
We've preserved the site
for you to investigate.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.109
If evidence is there...

08:19.240 --> 08:22.312
the Chief lnvestigator and l
feel confident you'll find it.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.879
I intend to.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.634
Lieutenant, here's the junction room.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.349
Schematics say the secondary
security bank's right in there.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.518
Still in one piece.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.594
There's a weak power signature
under this mess.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.029
It's probably an emergency light...

09:14.240 --> 09:15.912
running on batteries.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.628
Well, there's something here.
Some kind of surveillance recorder.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.074
Lieutenant.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.474
The timer might be broken,
but that bomb's armed. Don't move.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.519
The slightest vibration might set it off.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.952
Reed to Enterprise.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.878
I need an emergency transporter lock,
two to beam up on my mark.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.638
Acknowledged.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.639
Why not beam the bomb out of here?

09:59.760 --> 10:03.150
If there's a gravity switch,
it'll detonate in the matter stream.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.555
Enterprise to Reed.
The transporter's locked.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.318
Do you need assistance?

10:07.520 --> 10:10.671
Negative, Enterprise. Stand by.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.673
-I'm going to attempt to scan it.
-Attempt?

10:16.080 --> 10:17.069
Yeah.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.476
If I'd designed that bomb...

10:19.760 --> 10:23.514
I'd rig it to go off the instant
a sensor beam made contact.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.551
Look on the bright side.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.398
If it detonates...

10:31.480 --> 10:32.993
we'll never know.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.395
Steady.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.114
There's Vulcan DNA on these controls.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.356
So much for blaming Andorians.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.837
Boosting scan resolution.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.915
-That can't be good.
-Damn.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.838
Enterprise, mark.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.594
Enterprise!

11:20.440 --> 11:22.158
According to
the Vulcan Genome Registry...

11:22.280 --> 11:24.919
the DNA on the bomb's controls
was left by this woman.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.075
T'Pau.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.558
Since you had her DNA on record...

11:28.680 --> 11:30.272
does that mean
she's been arrested before?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.472
The Registry records DNA
from all Vulcans at birth.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.229
-Do you know anything about her?
-T'Pau is a well-known Syrrannite.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.434
All right.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.591
We've got a solid start.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.435
-Now we need to find her.
-Captain, T'Pau is Vulcan.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.910
The Security Directorate
will take charge of the investigation.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.156
Of course. Vulcan sovereignty.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.833
Lieutenant Reed and Commander T'Pol
will work with you.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.110
Their assistance isn't required.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.792
Chief lnvestigator.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.750
Forty-three people died in the bombing.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.950
Twelve Vulcans and 31 humans.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.918
We want her as much as you do.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.554
This is now a Vulcan security operation.

12:12.360 --> 12:16.319
We'll inform Ambassador Soval
of any developments that concern you.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.880
His death is a loss to both our worlds.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.315
If you're lost, Ambassador,
I can direct you to your shuttle.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.878
He saved my life...

13:18.760 --> 13:20.318
in the explosion.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.391
He could have saved himself.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.479
He always put...

13:35.960 --> 13:37.518
the mission first.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.837
The last time we spoke...

13:46.120 --> 13:49.237
he was anticipating the prospect
of joint missions.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.829
Humans and Vulcans working together.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.595
We have to make that possible...

14:00.720 --> 14:02.597
despite the High Command.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.832
It makes no sense...

14:07.960 --> 14:11.396
to think the Syrrannites are responsible
for this outrage.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.993
We have DNA evidence.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.998
Recheck everything, Captain.
Question everything.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.111
And don't let them keep you
on Enterprise.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.276
The answers you need are on Vulcan.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.995
And however far
you have to take this investigation...

14:25.440 --> 14:27.078
you have my support.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.269
Enter.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.634
-lt is agreeable to see you.
-What is the purpose of your visit?

14:54.200 --> 14:58.193
Does a husband need a purpose
to visit...his wife?

14:59.240 --> 15:02.277
-Your message was cryptic.
-By necessity.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.559
The Syrrannite threat has brought
new security measures into effect.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.389
Private communications
are no longer private.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.115
You have something to tell me
that the authorities shouldn't hear?

15:14.240 --> 15:15.992
Something to give you.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.513
Your mother asked me
to deliver it personally.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.919
She told me that it's been in your family
for generations...

15:27.040 --> 15:29.508
and now it's your turn to care for it.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.080
Why didn't she give this to me herself?

15:33.520 --> 15:35.556
The new security conditions.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.796
They've forced your mother into hiding
to avoid arrest.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.268
My mother?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.118
She's a Syrrannite.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.549
A Syrrannite? And she never told you?

15:59.880 --> 16:02.633
What's important is
that she's disappeared like the others...

16:02.760 --> 16:04.557
facing unjustified arrest.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.428
-Like T'Pau.
-No, there's a difference.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.075
My mother wants me to find her.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.918
-It's called an IDIC.
-Looks old.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.117
It's been modified.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.355
This is a desert called the Forge.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.838
The route's the one Surak
supposedly followed.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.359
1,800 years ago?

16:32.480 --> 16:36.598
Syrrannites follow the same path today,
seeking enlightenment.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.834
And you think your mother
is somewhere along that path?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.474
She told Koss
this was a family heirloom...

16:42.600 --> 16:44.670
but I've never seen it before.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.793
She didn't want Koss to know
about the map.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.038
With any luck...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.468
we can use this to find your mother...

17:00.040 --> 17:01.268
and T'Pau.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.512
Captain, have you seen the reports
on this place? It's a hellhole.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.553
-It's a Vulcan desert. I expect it'll be hot.
-It's got electrical sandstorms.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.592
Geomagnetic instabilities so bad,
technology won't work.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.393
So no communicators, no scanners,
no phase-pistols.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.794
We can't even beam you into it.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.230
-You're going to have to walk in.
-I'll be careful. You've got Enterprise.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.669
You and Malcolm keep
the investigation going up here.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.678
And whatever the Vulcans tell you,
believe the opposite.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.551
Present company excepted.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.830
-Ambassador.
-Captain. Commander.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.714
This shows the gaps
in our satellite surveillance...

17:32.840 --> 17:35.035
when beam-ins can't be detected.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.195
I'm thinking we're not exactly cleared
to have this.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.835
Have what, Commander?
All I see is a Starfleet data module.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.349
Right.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.395
Captain, what if something goes wrong
down there?

17:48.520 --> 17:49.953
It already has.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.349
Energise.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.630
This site is called Gateway...

18:05.880 --> 18:09.156
where Surak supposedly
began his journey into the Forge.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.316
You keep saying "supposedly."

18:11.440 --> 18:13.635
You don't believe Surak did the things
they said he did?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.751
He brought logic to Vulcan...

18:15.880 --> 18:18.440
in an age we call
the Time of Awakening.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.799
But his writings from that period
no longer exist.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.273
There must be some record of it.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.790
Over the centuries, his followers made
copies of his teachings.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.670
Let me guess. With the originals lost,
whatever's left is open to interpretation.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.748
-You find this amusing?
-I find it familiar.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.552
We should get moving.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.988
I thought technology didn't work here.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.518
The dampening field only extends
a few hundred metres above the ground.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.235
Patrol craft can fly over it,
but their sensors can't see us.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.800
No wonder the Syrrannites like it here.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.198
We're being stalked.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.950
-What the hell was that?
-Sehlat.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.675
Run.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.199
Higher ground.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.517
Higher. They won't climb.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.399
How long before it starts
to lose interest in us?

19:59.880 --> 20:02.348
Days, at least.

20:06.320 --> 20:10.632
They are very persistent creatures.
When I was a child, I had one as a pet.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.675
-You had one of those?
-Domesticated.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.635
They were smaller, slightly.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.753
How slightly?

20:23.840 --> 20:25.353
You have Porthos.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.356
Porthos doesn't try and eat me
when I'm late with his dinner.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.916
Vulcan children are never late
with their sehlat's dinner.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.438
I can believe that.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.120
The Captain asked me to re-examine
the DNA from the bomb...

20:40.240 --> 20:41.958
to see if anyone else
might have handled it.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.038
-You say you found an anomaly.
-ln these chromosomal fragments.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.798
Here and here.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.718
-What kind of anomaly?
-These are telomeres.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.751
A genetic clock, if you will.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.791
Each time a cell divides
they grow shorter.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.196
Sure. That's how you tell how old
someone is from a cell sample.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.153
Though T'Pau's current age
is 32 standard years...

21:00.280 --> 21:04.034
her DNA recovered from the bomb
has an age of only a few months.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.513
They used the DNA they sampled
when she was registered as a baby?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.712
Precisely. The evidence
implicating T'Pau is false.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.599
Captain Archer's going after
the wrong person.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.188
And there's no way to get word to him.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.557
Doc, take a look at this.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.390
It's the recording Malcolm recovered
from the embassy.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.794
According to the security log...

21:25.920 --> 21:28.514
this is when T'Pau's biometric signature
was recorded.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.108
-Undoubtedly another fabrication.
-But look...

21:31.960 --> 21:34.349
the guard recognised whoever it was.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.631
And that guard is your patient.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.074
Corporal Askwith?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.873
He could be our only chance
to identify who really planted the bomb.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.035
He's in a coma.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.879
His cranial injuries are substantial.
I don't expect him to recover.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.991
There must be a stimulant
you can inject him with...

21:50.120 --> 21:52.190
something to bring him round
just for a few minutes.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.834
There's only so much damage
a human body can withstand.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.509
I don't care about his body, Doc.
We need what's in his mind.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.956
Sounds like that Klingon opera
Hoshi made us listen to.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.232
The path is safe again.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.198
That's quite a trick.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.879
You are a human.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.833
Jonathan Archer.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.834
-Travelling with a Vulcan.
-T'Pol.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.229
Curious.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.034
-May we ask your name?
-Arev.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.517
That means "desert wind."

22:51.880 --> 22:53.029
Does it?

22:55.600 --> 22:58.558
-Why are you here?
-We could ask you the same thing.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.797
I follow the path of Surak
in meditation and study.

23:02.760 --> 23:03.909
And you?

23:04.480 --> 23:07.233
I'm on a pilgrimage
to study Surak and logic.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.398
T'Pol is my teacher.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.836
I welcome you to walk with me.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.395
But this is no place for your kind.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.115
Turn back.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.357
If it's all the same, I'll walk with you, too.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.199
This desert's called the Forge
for a reason.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.392
It will test you...

23:30.120 --> 23:31.633
and destroy you.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.278
The Plain of Blood.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.351
Some say Surak crossed this expanse...

23:53.480 --> 23:55.277
when the hot blood of battle
still flowed green.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.119
But with logic, he cooled it.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.872
Captain, the reflected heat
is too hot for you.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.151
I'll stick to the sand-covered parts
wherever I can.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.479
I won't need water
for several more days.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.313
You'd better protect your eyes
from the glare.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.154
My inner eyelids will protect my vision.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.555
My species evolved on this planet.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.759
How long have you tried
to understand Vulcan logic?

25:04.880 --> 25:06.632
Ever since I met T'Pol.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.916
Very well, student of Surak.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.557
Who said, "Logic is the cement of our
civilisation with which we ascend...

25:15.680 --> 25:18.194
"from chaos using reason
as our guide?"

25:18.920 --> 25:20.638
I'm new at this. You tell me.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.958
Something more basic then. What is
Kiri-kin-tha's First Law of Metaphysics?

25:26.400 --> 25:29.312
I'm familiar
with Newton's First Law of Motion.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.915
I imagine they're pretty much the same.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.112
You haven't been truthful
about your presence here.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.478
-Have you?
-Vulcans do not lie.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.830
I've dealt with the High Command.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.469
Vulcans can lie and cheat
with the best of them.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.672
The High Command
does not follow Surak's true path.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.028
No wonder you humans are their allies.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.149
From the questions he asked you...

26:05.800 --> 26:07.870
I believe he is a Syrrannite.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.277
And it's obvious that he doesn't trust us
enough to take us to the others.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.356
That only leaves one option.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.596
We have to tell him
what he wants to know, the truth.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.554
It may be too late for that. Sand-fire!

26:35.600 --> 26:37.636
This man's our only witness.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.593
He's comatose, brain-damaged,
and he's human.

26:41.080 --> 26:44.470
A mind-meld is dangerous
under the best of conditions.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.635
But, under these--

26:45.760 --> 26:47.990
Look, I know Phlox says
there aren't a lot of Vulcans...

26:48.120 --> 26:49.394
who can do this sort of thing...

26:49.520 --> 26:52.080
but you've got to know someone
who could at least try.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.078
Those who do have the ability
won't risk their careers...

26:55.200 --> 26:57.270
by publicly attempting what you suggest.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.551
Most Vulcans see melding
as deviant behaviour.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.110
What's that got to do with it?

27:03.400 --> 27:07.109
Evidence will solve this crime,
not mind-melds.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.630
What evidence?
The DNA on the bomb was planted.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.116
-You can prove that?
-I can.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.794
Ambassador.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.837
I don't know what kind of pull it takes
to mess with DNA records on Vulcan...

27:20.960 --> 27:24.635
but I think we're looking
at a deliberate attempt to hide the truth.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.910
You're suggesting a conspiracy.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.993
-One that cost 43 innocent lives.
-Aren't they worth a little risk?

27:35.160 --> 27:36.912
The needs of the many.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.557
I can perform the meld.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.229
Captain.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.068
Over here!

28:31.280 --> 28:32.838
Help me with this.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.515
The sandfire can still reach us.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.679
I know this.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.912
-How did you get this medallion?
-From my mother.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.989
T'Les.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.153
You're a Syrrannite.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.714
The daughter of T'Les serves
on a human starship.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.513
When did you talk with her?
Is she safe?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.070
You're the human responsible
for the destruction...

29:19.200 --> 29:20.918
of the monastery at P'Jem.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.479
Is that going to be a problem?

29:23.600 --> 29:27.513
The High Command defiled P'Jem
when they used it to spy on Andoria.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.595
-You exposed their hypocrisy.
-You seem to know a lot about us.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.152
I'm guessing that means
you know why we're here.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.950
Your mother is safe with the others,
at the T'Karath Sanctuary.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.513
It's not far.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.477
I'll guide you both there
when the storm has passed.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.828
I don't know if this has ever been
attempted with a human before.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.677
My mind...to your mind.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.358
Our minds are one.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.070
Our thoughts are joined.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.755
Yes.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.592
I see what you see.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.519
The embassy.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.029
I'm at my station. At your station.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.076
So many new people arriving...

30:54.120 --> 30:55.519
for the summit.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.196
I don't recognise them all...

30:58.600 --> 31:01.068
but some I know.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.348
A package.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.473
That's all right.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.473
I don't need to see it. Go right through.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.319
Who are you? Who?

31:26.960 --> 31:28.234
Ambassador.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.919
What'd you see?

31:45.080 --> 31:47.992
How long do these sandfire storms
usually last?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.389
A day.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.913
Perhaps two.
I've never seen one this strong.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.918
But we're safe here,
and we're in no hurry.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.192
Maybe we should be.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.789
The High Command believes
the Syrrannites are responsible...

32:06.920 --> 32:09.036
for bombing the Earth embassy.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.597
-That's not our way.
-They seem to think that it is.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.513
That you and your leader believe in...

32:14.640 --> 32:17.438
a corrupted version
of Surak's teachings.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.195
Did your mother tell you the story?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.159
Of the lDlC?

32:24.280 --> 32:27.113
"lnfinite Diversity
in lnfinite Combination."

32:27.680 --> 32:30.638
Words that are a mere shadow
of its true meaning.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.597
Surak tells us that the story of the lDlC
has no end.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.109
But it begins here, at Mount Seleya.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.271
Surak died on Mount Seleya.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.550
His body, yes.
But his katra was spirited away...

32:48.960 --> 32:53.317
before the last battle against those who
marched beneath the Raptor's wings.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.633
Those who wanted to return
to the savage ways.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.633
What's a katra?

33:01.320 --> 33:04.596
Syrrannites claim it's the essence
of a Vulcan mind.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.270
That it can be transferred
from the body before death...

33:08.760 --> 33:10.512
then stored in some manner.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.915
Some say Surak's katra was found...

33:13.160 --> 33:15.196
and now is carried by a Syrrannite...

33:15.320 --> 33:18.357
so all those who meld with him
may touch Surak's mind.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.035
Syrrannites conduct mind-melding?

33:22.280 --> 33:25.670
Surak tells us it is the heritage
of every Vulcan.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.553
Even those who don't believe
in the practise.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.835
A witness?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.154
The guard recognised the person...

33:39.280 --> 33:41.430
who brought in the bomb
we found in the rubble.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.949
-The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau.
-No.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.594
It was you.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.153
I would like to interrogate
this witness myself.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.909
-You're not getting anywhere near him.
-Perhaps I could speak with the guard.

33:58.040 --> 34:01.032
I'm afraid he's in no condition
to be questioned.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.873
He's in a coma.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.274
Yet, he provided an eyewitness account.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.909
We accessed his memories
through a mind-meld.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.313
-Telepathic evidence is inadmissible.
-It's not evidence at all!

34:22.440 --> 34:25.795
You allowed this distasteful act
to take place?

34:27.040 --> 34:28.473
I performed it.

34:32.639 --> 34:33.708
Soval.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.235
You've shamed Vulcan and yourself.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.516
The law leaves me no recourse.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.356
You'll be summoned to appear
before the High Command...

34:45.480 --> 34:47.869
to account for your actions.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.038
Commander. Doctor.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.754
At one time, the High Command...

34:55.880 --> 34:58.997
was only responsible
for the exploration of space.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.752
But that's changed.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.869
I've been told Vulcans
have never been explorers.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.675
I think you've been told many things
about us that aren't true.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.032
Reseal the entrance!

35:20.280 --> 35:21.349
T'Pol!

35:28.440 --> 35:29.475
Easy.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.994
Listen. The storm is gaining strength.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.914
Arev.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.473
-You must carry it to sanctuary.
-Carry what?

35:52.400 --> 35:56.996
Tuluk tu Vokau.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.274
-You can't go back.
-I'm not a fool, Commander.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.834
V'Las was involved with the attack
on your embassy.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.190
He's responsible for blaming it
on the Syrrannites.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.629
Then why turn yourself over to him?

36:10.800 --> 36:14.031
It's the only chance I'll have
to reach the rest of the High Command.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.196
What if they're all in on it?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.395
If you really want humans and Vulcans
to work together someday...

36:25.520 --> 36:28.239
you might start thinking
about trusting us.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.830
Peace and long life, Commander.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.069
Right.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.469
Arev.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.551
-Are you injured?
-I'm fine.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.558
He said something in Vulcan.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.392
-"Vokau. "
-Remember.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.119
Remember what?

37:19.920 --> 37:21.319
I think he...

37:23.480 --> 37:24.754
punched me.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.393
The storm's over?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.836
The patrol craft are flying again.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.032
They sound like they're closing in
on this location.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.309
He said we weren't far
from the T'Karath Sanctuary.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.396
We should keep moving.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.998
After we bury him.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.754
They're following a grid search pattern.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.312
No sensors,
but they can still make visual contact.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.673
We have to find cover before the sun
comes up.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.829
That way.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.356
-There's nothing there.
-That's where the Syrrannites are.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.919
How do you know?

39:05.160 --> 39:09.438
-I'm good for a few more days.
-Captain, you're not Vulcan.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.149
Right.

39:17.160 --> 39:20.914
It's almost dawn.
We need to find someplace to hide.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.509
No.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.668
Over here.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.632
That won't help us.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.753
Don't resist.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.393
What do you mean?

39:54.305 --> 40:00.544
