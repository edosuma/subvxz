00:02.695 --> 00:04.161
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:04.238 --> 00:05.496
I thought you were supposed
to be packing all this up.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.714
I am, and I will.

00:06.791 --> 00:08.874
After one last twirl
with your stolen centrifuge?

00:08.885 --> 00:11.002
I'll get it. Thank you. Uh...

00:11.078 --> 00:12.003
Are we getting sopaipillas?

00:14.040 --> 00:15.348
Oh, good. Thanks.

00:17.043 --> 00:18.801
The hell are you doing here?
They said that you mixed

00:18.878 --> 00:20.469
whiskey with your medication.
Uncle Tripp.

00:20.546 --> 00:21.721
I let him down.

00:21.797 --> 00:23.139
And tonight I went
to the bunker.

00:23.215 --> 00:24.899
I keep trying to crack the code.

00:29.555 --> 00:31.397
It was you. You're Walt.

00:31.408 --> 00:32.648
<i>You're the little boy
in the photo.</i>

00:32.725 --> 00:33.908
You knew my mother.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.695
I don't talk about my past.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.039
Period.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.366
It's about <i> my</i> past.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.660
You've been lying
to me all this time,

00:44.737 --> 00:46.254
you crusty old piece of...
Okay, okay, Michael.

00:48.157 --> 00:49.623
Mr. Sanders, I assure you,

00:49.634 --> 00:52.335
I have a deep
appreciation for secrecy.

00:52.411 --> 00:53.836
What you tell us

00:53.913 --> 00:55.596
will stay between us.

00:55.673 --> 00:58.057
But you <i> will</i> tell us.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.895
Okay, look, beers on us
as long as you're talking.

01:04.515 --> 01:07.183
Hypothesis. The specimens

01:07.259 --> 01:10.061
display resistance
to earthly infectious diseases

01:10.137 --> 01:12.280
due to alien
hereditary immunity.

01:12.357 --> 01:14.032
Hypothesis.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.784
Pooled immunoglobulin

01:16.861 --> 01:18.286
harvested from an alien donor

01:18.363 --> 01:20.404
can be transferred
to a human recipient.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.198
<i>Human subjects exposed</i>

01:22.274 --> 01:24.283
to specific sequencing
of alien DNA

01:24.294 --> 01:28.245
<i>will develop immunity
to corresponding diseases.</i>

01:32.218 --> 01:34.585
Papi, hi.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.637
How's Rosa doing?

01:36.714 --> 01:38.923
- She's sleeping still.
- Listen, Carl's wife,

01:38.999 --> 01:40.975
she's in labor.
Again?

01:41.052 --> 01:42.310
So you'll need to close up.

01:42.387 --> 01:44.387
Clean up the griddle.
Marry the ketchups.

01:44.463 --> 01:46.147
Scrape the gum
from underneath the tables.

01:46.224 --> 01:47.890
It gets worse
the longer you leave it.

01:54.324 --> 01:55.773
Mm, ouch.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.942
Did I hurt you?

01:58.018 --> 02:00.236
No, but the chair did.

02:00.312 --> 02:02.238
This is getting ridiculous.
Come on.

02:02.314 --> 02:03.456
But this is our spot.

02:03.533 --> 02:05.116
I just wish I could
take you out.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.993
Someplace other
than the hospital.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.419
What makes you think
that you can't?

02:10.531 --> 02:13.174
Okay. Let's go out.

02:13.251 --> 02:15.668
Now.

02:41.353 --> 02:43.154
Oh, Sheriff.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.539
Where...

02:44.615 --> 02:46.874
Where-Where's,
uh... Is...

02:46.951 --> 02:48.200
Where's Charlie C...
Charlie Cameron?

02:48.277 --> 02:49.285
She was just here. We were...

02:49.361 --> 02:50.327
We were just talking.
There was this...

02:50.338 --> 02:51.337
Stand up, Evans.

02:56.961 --> 02:58.169
Hands.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.345
What?

03:08.714 --> 03:11.724
It's midnight.
Nothing's open.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.142
You said you
wanted a burger,

03:13.219 --> 03:15.695
and I happen to know people. Oh.

03:16.739 --> 03:18.239
Kyle?

03:18.316 --> 03:20.158
Hi.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.650
I was just locking up.

03:21.727 --> 03:23.319
You're coat closet girl, right?

03:23.395 --> 03:26.322
Uh, Liz, uh, Steph.

03:26.398 --> 03:28.199
I wanted to buy
her a burger,

03:28.275 --> 03:31.869
and Carl usually, um...
Right.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.580
We should go. No. Oh, God, no.
Please, come on in.

03:34.591 --> 03:37.541
Burger's the least I could do.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.727
About the coat closet, um...

03:56.804 --> 03:58.020
Look, we just met.

03:58.097 --> 03:59.780
You don't have to
apologize.

03:59.857 --> 04:01.106
It's not like I was assuming
you were

04:01.117 --> 04:03.734
a blushing virgin or something.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.786
Liz and I dated in high school.

04:05.863 --> 04:08.030
Yeah, I-I can't decide
if I should be charmed

04:08.107 --> 04:10.241
or unnerved that you
somehow orchestrated

04:10.317 --> 04:11.292
your ex third-wheeling
our first date.

04:11.369 --> 04:13.077
Oh, come on.
Oh, be charmed.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.454
And, you don't... you don't
know the half of it.

04:15.465 --> 04:18.132
Kyle and I not only
used to date,

04:18.209 --> 04:20.510
we also share a sister.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.472
Yeah, my mom, his dad,
a torrid affair in the '80s.

04:24.549 --> 04:26.173
Oh, so you're not related?

04:26.250 --> 04:27.383
Oh...

04:27.459 --> 04:28.634
Oh, uh, we figured...

04:28.645 --> 04:30.761
Yeah, we're good.
I compared our DNA.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.804
You did?

04:31.814 --> 04:34.056
Hi, I'm Liz. Have we met? Mm.

04:34.133 --> 04:37.101
Um, do you have
a liquor license?

04:37.177 --> 04:38.561
You know what,
I'm gonna get you

04:38.637 --> 04:42.106
Arturo Ortecho's
emergency stash.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.442
Thanks.
Huh.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.328
I'll be right back.

04:50.149 --> 04:52.241
Ooh, uh...

04:52.318 --> 04:54.001
she shouldn't be drinking.

04:54.078 --> 04:56.837
Oh, is she in recovery?

04:56.914 --> 04:58.673
She's sick.

04:58.749 --> 05:00.624
I... She doesn't think I know,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.234
and she's trying to pretend
like everything's normal,

05:02.236 --> 05:04.086
but it's actually a big deal
she's even out of the hospital.

05:04.163 --> 05:06.514
It's a very rare blood disease.
She was exposed to bacteria.

05:06.591 --> 05:08.132
You looked at her
medical records?

05:08.208 --> 05:10.676
Oh, now you're respectful
of hospital policy?

05:10.687 --> 05:12.928
Whoa, we are talking
about a human being,

05:13.005 --> 05:15.189
not borrowed machinery.
Got it.

05:15.266 --> 05:16.473
So if it's for your boyfriend,

05:16.550 --> 05:17.766
we're all expected
to lie, steal and cheat,

05:17.843 --> 05:19.768
but otherwise we have
a strict moral code.

05:19.845 --> 05:21.862
Okay, enough, yes.
You've guilted me enough.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.367
If you were the one who died,
I would have fought like hell

05:26.444 --> 05:27.785
to save you, too.

05:29.521 --> 05:31.539
Your love life,
on the other hand...

05:34.026 --> 05:36.035
I think you should tell Steph
what you know.

05:36.045 --> 05:39.371
I hate that I can't help her.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.623
I-I hate that she's lying.

05:40.699 --> 05:42.041
I hate that I even
like her anyway.

05:42.051 --> 05:45.127
She's a feisty Latina.
You clearly have a type.

05:45.204 --> 05:47.338
You know, I think she's
just trying to protect you.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.632
Lying to protect someone
is still lying.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.810
Yes.

05:54.713 --> 05:57.565
What are you hiding?

05:58.926 --> 06:00.392
Max is freaked out
by science experiments.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.977
Uh-huh.
Like, in general.

06:02.054 --> 06:03.904
He thinks his life's gonna turn
out like the end of <i> E.T.,</i>

06:03.981 --> 06:06.482
and I don't want to stress out
his heart right now,

06:06.558 --> 06:08.576
so I haven't told him that I'm
back to work in the lab.

06:08.653 --> 06:10.578
Another way to not
cause him any stress

06:10.655 --> 06:14.865
would be to just maybe <i> not</i>
experiment on alien DNA.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.083
You know that, right?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.251
It's me.

06:17.328 --> 06:18.753
There's no risk of guys
in Hazmat suits

06:18.829 --> 06:20.496
stealing him out of a bicycle basket.
Mm-hmm.

06:20.572 --> 06:22.998
I mean, I would-I would never
expose his family.

06:23.075 --> 06:26.001
And what if my research
could help Maria?

06:26.078 --> 06:28.087
I looked at those files.
Any record of the experiment

06:28.097 --> 06:31.256
done on Maria's grandmother
was lost in a fire.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.384
What are you doing in that lab?
Kyle,

06:33.460 --> 06:35.436
the aliens have
never been sick.

06:35.513 --> 06:37.554
So my theory is that

06:37.631 --> 06:40.849
their planet is
very similar to ours,

06:40.926 --> 06:43.060
but just more evolved.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.521
So its inhabitants have
built up a hereditary immunity

06:45.597 --> 06:47.856
to illnesses that still
plague this planet.

06:47.933 --> 06:51.568
So you're saying...
Down the line,

06:51.645 --> 06:55.781
alien DNA could create
a universal vaccine.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.866
This could end illness.

06:57.943 --> 06:59.785
Cool. Good to know
we're operating

06:59.796 --> 07:01.078
in the realm of realism here.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.499
Oh...
What is it?

07:05.576 --> 07:06.801
Aah!

07:06.877 --> 07:08.127
Should we call
the fire department?

07:08.137 --> 07:10.796
Maybe I could meet
a cute fireman.

07:10.807 --> 07:12.631
Since the doctor
I sometimes make out with

07:12.642 --> 07:15.801
is whisper-yelling
at his ex-girlfriend

07:15.812 --> 07:18.095
slash, kinda-sister person.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.981
These shakes are on the house.

07:21.058 --> 07:23.142
We were whispering
about you, if that helps.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.643
Kyle is totally into you.

07:24.654 --> 07:26.311
I'm right here.
It helps,

07:26.388 --> 07:28.147
but, uh, this is still
a first date story

07:28.157 --> 07:29.273
fit for a Reddit thread.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.991
Oh, it could be worse.

07:31.068 --> 07:32.985
I just went on a date with a guy
who had selective amnesia

07:32.995 --> 07:34.161
and forgot that I existed.

07:34.238 --> 07:35.663
And the first thing
he wanted to know

07:35.740 --> 07:37.489
was the worst thing
I ever did.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.285
Um, I'm guessing
that ended badly.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.538
Oh, he's the love of her life.

07:44.615 --> 07:46.331
Are you attracted to red flags?

07:46.408 --> 07:48.417
Hmm.

07:48.494 --> 07:50.511
Red has always been
my color.

07:50.588 --> 07:53.005
If you need anything...

07:53.015 --> 07:55.257
You know what?
Kyle knows where everything is.

07:55.334 --> 07:57.852
So, um, I'm gonna be
upstairs with my research,

07:57.928 --> 07:59.562
and, uh...

08:03.675 --> 08:07.853
just, uh, shout
when you want to leave.

08:07.864 --> 08:11.198
She's not subtle.

08:11.275 --> 08:14.818
So... Valenti...

08:14.895 --> 08:16.061
Mm-hmm.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.613
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

08:17.689 --> 08:19.698
Okay, um...

08:21.693 --> 08:24.211
I was a high school dick.

08:24.288 --> 08:26.872
Mm. And the guy I treated
the worst back then

08:26.883 --> 08:29.759
is one of the only people
I can count on now.

08:31.796 --> 08:34.054
And I hate what
I put him through.

08:34.131 --> 08:37.006
I once catfished a girl
for an entire semester

08:37.083 --> 08:39.676
just so that she could
get stood up at prom

08:39.753 --> 08:43.063
by her super hot,
super fake boyfriend.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.565
You were a bully?

08:46.176 --> 08:48.944
I've evolved since high school.

08:51.056 --> 08:52.689
It's just annoying because

08:52.766 --> 08:55.818
I can't shake off
that insecurity.

08:55.894 --> 08:58.487
I can't stop thinking what
someone as perfect as you

08:58.564 --> 09:00.155
is doing with someone like me.

09:00.232 --> 09:03.534
Stop it.
I'm not perfect, Steph.

09:03.610 --> 09:07.371
The other day, I tried
looking for you at the hospital.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.925
And I found you
on an operating table.

09:11.001 --> 09:13.836
That was a routine procedure.
Stop.

09:13.912 --> 09:14.837
I know you're dying.

09:14.913 --> 09:17.097
It's none of your business!

09:17.174 --> 09:19.341
We just kissed a few times.

09:19.418 --> 09:20.768
That doesn't give you
unfettered access

09:20.845 --> 09:22.886
to my medical records.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.930
Did you know that I was sick

09:24.941 --> 09:26.098
before you kissed me?

09:26.174 --> 09:28.484
Yeah, but I meant it...
Wow!

09:28.561 --> 09:30.853
I thought you were the only one
who saw me as a person,

09:30.929 --> 09:31.937
and not as a patient.

09:31.948 --> 09:34.857
But then you pity-kissed me?!

09:34.933 --> 09:36.692
Wow, that's what this is.
No.

09:36.768 --> 09:39.361
You just want to be
some big hero

09:39.438 --> 09:40.871
that gives the dying girl
one last thrill.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.200
Well, it'll be a great story
once I'm gone.

09:45.277 --> 09:47.035
Look, Steph,
would you please...

09:47.112 --> 09:49.672
Do not follow me.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.544
Hey, hey,
I heard the yelling.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.141
Maybe I can help.

10:01.218 --> 10:03.143
This antitoxin
I want to develop,

10:03.220 --> 10:05.804
it could help her. She
doesn't have time for that.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.098
If there's information
that could prevent a body count,

10:08.175 --> 10:09.808
and I don't apply it
to saving lives,

10:09.819 --> 10:10.985
I mean, isn't that blood
on my hands?

10:11.061 --> 10:12.311
Do you even hear yourself?

10:12.321 --> 10:14.771
Come back to Earth, Liz.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.658
If you go public with research
based on alien DNA,

10:17.735 --> 10:19.326
it would risk exposing
the aliens.

10:19.403 --> 10:21.445
I would never let that happen.
Me neither.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.572
Because you'd risk
exposing Rosa.

10:23.649 --> 10:25.165
The pod altered her DNA, too.

10:25.242 --> 10:27.167
You have to stop.

10:28.278 --> 10:29.169
We're closed!

10:29.246 --> 10:31.788
Max is in serious trouble.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.000
Do you want to tell Liz how
you royally boned us, Kyle,

10:35.011 --> 10:36.635
or should I?

10:44.503 --> 10:45.969
It's midnight,
cowgirls and cowboys.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.521
Here you go.
Dollar lemon drop shots

10:47.598 --> 10:49.356
for the next 12 minutes.

10:52.102 --> 10:54.478
I'm gonna need another
one of those.

10:54.554 --> 10:58.649
I know you can drink and talk
at the same time, Sanders.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.318
Oh, damn, I'm out of smokes.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.278
How are you even still alive?

11:03.355 --> 11:06.031
It ain't good genes.

11:06.042 --> 11:08.208
My mom died young,

11:08.285 --> 11:12.371
and Dad was a violent
son-of-a-bitch deadbeat.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.623
I ran away as soon
as I could.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.293
And I ended up,
as people tend to do,

11:18.370 --> 11:20.671
<i>at a little diner</i>

11:20.747 --> 11:24.549
<i>on a little street
in a little town.</i>

11:27.713 --> 11:29.638
That all you got?

11:29.715 --> 11:32.349
Well, I need peppers, tomatoes.
Where are my onions?

11:32.426 --> 11:34.726
Sorry, sir. I can't get a damn
thing to grow in this drought.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.479
Hope your customers
like their omelets plain.

11:37.556 --> 11:39.398
I like 'em plain.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.408
I can wash dishes or mop floors.

11:41.485 --> 11:43.068
This look like Soviet Russia?

11:43.079 --> 11:45.195
I don't know.
Well, it ain't.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.699
No such thing
as a free lunch. Now scram.

11:52.329 --> 11:53.996
Oh, you're a dollar
and a half short.

11:54.072 --> 11:57.216
That's a tax
for using the front door, boy.

11:59.578 --> 12:01.261
Hey, kid?

12:02.497 --> 12:04.723
You know how to drive?
I'm eight.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.092
Then you're already
a year behind. Let's go.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.636
<i>Bronson gave me work
on the farm</i>

12:09.713 --> 12:12.514
all spring.
It was quiet

12:12.591 --> 12:14.608
until the night the women came.

12:14.685 --> 12:17.019
Who's there?!

12:18.555 --> 12:21.064
<i>Bronson stitched 'em up.</i>

12:22.809 --> 12:24.618
<i>Taught 'em English.</i>

12:26.146 --> 12:28.831
We picked their names
out of a book one night.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.961
We became a family.

12:34.038 --> 12:36.121
Is it really

12:36.132 --> 12:37.748
better than the radio?

12:37.824 --> 12:40.042
There's nothing on this earth
like live music.

12:40.118 --> 12:42.753
It makes your
bones lighter.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.255
No matter where you are,
you feel like you belong.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.975
I can't wait to have that memory.
Mm.

12:48.052 --> 12:49.852
What memory?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.109
Let me guess.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.153
You don't want
to go to the fair.

13:08.164 --> 13:10.113
Even with all that work
you've been doing to build

13:10.190 --> 13:11.490
Walt that pumpkin launcher?

13:11.500 --> 13:12.991
You know we can't go.

13:13.002 --> 13:15.619
Oh, it's been over a year.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.337
No big bad villain's
coming for you.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.122
Nora, you got a knack

13:19.199 --> 13:21.333
for engineering.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.751
You will win that
pumpkin-chunking contest

13:22.828 --> 13:23.960
if you come.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.013
We need the money,

13:26.090 --> 13:29.341
and Bernhardt won't award
first prize to a colored man.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.895
These wars they wage
are not worth fighting.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.933
They'll learn, in time.

13:38.009 --> 13:39.267
There's a band playing.

13:39.344 --> 13:41.186
Louise says

13:41.197 --> 13:42.896
there's no music
where you come from.

13:42.973 --> 13:45.690
Louise wants to dance with you.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.276
But she can't
do that, can she?

13:48.353 --> 13:50.704
Our children are in danger.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.450
She can't just disappear
into some imaginary safe place.

13:55.527 --> 13:57.461
Tell me what you're planning.

13:59.531 --> 14:01.381
I know you're building
something. What is it?

14:01.458 --> 14:03.834
A flying saucer?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.544
A time machine?

14:05.554 --> 14:07.170
You brought her here,

14:07.247 --> 14:08.722
now you're just gonna
take her away from me?

14:08.799 --> 14:11.558
Louise is hopeful. I can't be.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.468
I have to protect her,

14:13.545 --> 14:16.638
at all costs.

14:16.715 --> 14:21.568
I protect Louise because only
Louise can protect the child.

14:25.149 --> 14:27.241
So, come to the fair, Nora.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.914
Let Louise hear the music
before you go.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.917
Please, Miss Nora!

14:38.403 --> 14:40.462
<i>You're dramatizing.</i>

14:40.539 --> 14:42.205
You barely remember
this morning.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.332
I remember every damn word.

14:44.409 --> 14:48.086
I held onto those
memories for dear life.

14:48.097 --> 14:51.673
Because that day

14:51.750 --> 14:53.884
was the beginning of the end.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.887
This pumpkin won first prize
at the fair.

14:58.256 --> 14:59.815
Tripp. There you are.

15:02.093 --> 15:04.019
They've been here all along.

15:04.095 --> 15:05.821
Right under our damn noses.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.194
The audacity.

15:12.270 --> 15:15.530
I can have tanks and howitzers
here in two days.

15:15.607 --> 15:18.408
The day after tomorrow,
we raid the Long farm.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.460
This time,
we show no mercy.

15:20.537 --> 15:22.629
No woman fools
a Manes man twice.

15:29.004 --> 15:31.296
Nora wanted to
leave right way,

15:31.307 --> 15:34.883
but I begged for one more night
as a family.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.760
<i>She caved.</i>

15:36.836 --> 15:38.261
<i>She always caved.</i>

15:38.338 --> 15:40.555
<i>Stop.</i>

15:40.632 --> 15:42.983
I don't need
another recap of, uh,

15:43.060 --> 15:45.435
Tripp Manes leading a massacre.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.446
It's my mother's
story, too.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.782
I want to know how she died.

15:50.859 --> 15:52.817
Move up.
On your left.

15:52.828 --> 15:53.994
What was that?

15:54.071 --> 15:55.245
Hold, hold.

15:57.241 --> 15:58.823
It's people.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.043
They got guns.
Get away from there, Walt.

16:02.988 --> 16:05.255
Hide here
and don't make a sound.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.716
Okay.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.179
"X" marks the spot, Walt.
You understand?

16:12.256 --> 16:13.838
Okay.

16:19.263 --> 16:21.763
The only thing worse
than a liar is a traitor.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.857
You have to understand.

16:23.934 --> 16:25.684
They're just people, sir.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.602
They're the enemy.

16:27.679 --> 16:29.688
No!

16:29.698 --> 16:33.024
<i>Your mothers must have put up
a hell of a fight.</i>

16:41.285 --> 16:43.710
<i>Nora built an escape hatch.</i>

16:43.787 --> 16:45.671
Aah!

16:50.744 --> 16:53.470
<i>I got out, but it was too late.</i>

16:54.965 --> 16:56.890
Oh, no, no...

16:56.967 --> 16:58.642
<i>I should have done something.</i>

16:59.895 --> 17:02.012
<i>But the soldiers</i>

17:02.088 --> 17:06.223
<i>were determined
to leave no survivors.</i>

17:06.234 --> 17:09.019
<i>Those bastards,
they shot everyone</i>

17:09.095 --> 17:11.405
<i>who wasn't wearing
a military uniform.</i>

17:11.481 --> 17:16.526
<i>Other farmers, neighbors who
came to see what was happening.</i>

17:16.603 --> 17:20.571
<i>No one lived to tell
the story but me.</i>

17:33.912 --> 17:35.879
<i>You saw the ship explode?</i>

17:35.955 --> 17:38.256
<i>And you never told anybody?</i>

17:38.267 --> 17:41.051
<i>I don't know what I saw.</i>

17:41.127 --> 17:42.635
I got the hell
out of Roswell.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.929
I didn't ever want
to come back,

17:44.940 --> 17:47.432
but I had unfinished business.

17:47.443 --> 17:50.694
Nora stuck this in my pocket
that night.

17:51.805 --> 17:52.863
It's a map.

17:56.452 --> 18:01.621
It led me to where they hid you
in your freaky eggs.

18:01.698 --> 18:05.075
I kept an eye out
over the years.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.545
One day, I went to the cave,
and you were gone.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.299
Then you were
someone else's problem,

18:12.376 --> 18:14.301
for a long time.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.514
Wait, wait. Um...

18:20.768 --> 18:22.550
This photo.

18:22.627 --> 18:24.469
That's you, right?

18:24.480 --> 18:27.180
And-and that's
Roy Bronson,

18:27.257 --> 18:29.191
and that's Nora.

18:31.561 --> 18:35.146
Whose hand is that there,
on her shoulder?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.148
Eh, beats me.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.568
Mr. Bernhardt, Mr. Jones.
Old man Gibbons.

18:40.645 --> 18:43.113
I don't know.
Could've been anybody.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.208
Thank you, Mr. Sanders.

18:48.245 --> 18:50.837
Louise was a
firecracker, honey.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.257
Just like you.

18:56.828 --> 18:59.262
That's why we all
fell for her so hard.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.355
You think it's true?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.683
That he remembers
every single word?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.860
Oh, my God.
He said my mom

19:13.937 --> 19:16.020
told Bronson,
"I protect Louise,

19:16.031 --> 19:19.366
because Louise is the only one
who can protect the child."

19:19.443 --> 19:22.035
Not children. Just child.

19:23.947 --> 19:27.782
My mom sacrificed herself
for Max.

19:27.859 --> 19:29.784
The healer.

19:29.861 --> 19:31.786
Was the frickin' savior.

19:31.863 --> 19:33.204
Come on, Michael.
You are so good

19:33.281 --> 19:36.049
at manufacturing things
to be angry about.

19:36.126 --> 19:38.501
We both know the universe
tilts in Max's direction.

19:38.578 --> 19:42.139
We were just along
for the ride.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.385
<i>Isobel. I need your help.</i>

19:47.396 --> 19:48.562
<i>Hurry.</i>

19:50.256 --> 19:51.565
Isobel.

19:51.641 --> 19:52.983
Hmm?

19:53.059 --> 19:55.477
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's, um...

19:55.553 --> 19:57.696
I need to process this, okay?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.533
I'll see you later.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.501
They let you leave
the hospital?

20:19.577 --> 20:20.835
It's midnight.

20:20.912 --> 20:23.713
Yeah, well, I came for my pills.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.548
Going through my stuff, huh?
You know, when we were kids,

20:25.625 --> 20:26.933
all you ever talked about was

20:27.010 --> 20:30.437
your war hero
grandfather Harlan.

20:30.514 --> 20:32.314
You never mentioned Tripp.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.277
That's you, isn't it?

20:42.892 --> 20:45.527
Mm-hmm.

20:45.603 --> 20:48.363
Dad, there is more evidence
that you have a heart

20:48.439 --> 20:51.291
in this old box
than I've seen in 28 years.

20:51.368 --> 20:54.961
Well, I believe
in raising boys to be men.

20:55.038 --> 20:58.081
And men don't cry
in front of their sons.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.800
That's why I never told you
about Tripp.

21:07.643 --> 21:10.468
Okay, here you go.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.888
Let me know if there's
anything else that you need.

21:13.965 --> 21:16.483
Oh, no, no, this is, uh...

21:16.560 --> 21:18.652
This is too generous.
I can't...

21:18.728 --> 21:20.478
I heard you talking about
saving up to buy this place.

21:20.489 --> 21:24.107
I'm investing in
the American dream, Arturo.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.575
Thank you, senor.

21:27.645 --> 21:29.012
Sorry I'm late.

21:29.014 --> 21:31.164
Made the mistake of
telling Dad where I was going.

21:31.241 --> 21:33.324
Had to listen to his whole
speech about employing illegals.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.169
What do you think, Jesse?

21:36.246 --> 21:38.288
I don't get why
he's all worked up

21:38.364 --> 21:39.455
about a couple busboys.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.624
They're not hurting anyone.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.335
They're only a problem if
they come for what's ours.

21:44.412 --> 21:47.130
Right.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.965
Preemptive strikes don't
make us appear strong,

21:49.042 --> 21:51.009
they make us appear afraid.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.852
That's crucial.

21:52.929 --> 21:55.138
Jesse, you're shipping out soon.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.806
I'm very proud of you.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.475
I'd like to believe
I can trust you

21:59.552 --> 22:01.361
with something
very important to me.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.106
Sir, if this is about
the 1947 crash,

22:05.183 --> 22:06.700
I already know.

22:06.776 --> 22:08.743
My father told me.

22:13.358 --> 22:14.616
Go on home, Jesse.

22:14.692 --> 22:15.825
I need a word with my brother.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.994
Yes, sir, Grandpa Harlan.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.330
Jesse, remember,

22:20.406 --> 22:23.666
justice must never be served
until disaster has struck.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.595
You remember that?
Yes, sir.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.132
And that was the last time
I saw Tripp.

22:31.209 --> 22:33.560
Harlan told me at the funeral
that a...

22:33.637 --> 22:36.563
an alien had possessed Tripp.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.514
Seduced him.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.183
Tricked him into
trusting her.

22:40.259 --> 22:44.729
She was able to get her ultimate
revenge on our family.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.190
Anyway, that day
at the diner,

22:47.266 --> 22:50.151
he slipped that to me
under the table.

22:50.228 --> 22:52.329
I have no idea
what it means.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.752
Hey, why don't you
lay off that, Sarge?

23:01.948 --> 23:03.256
Right.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.041
I forgot who I was
dealing with for a minute.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.674
I am not going to sit here
and watch you

23:12.750 --> 23:16.102
drink yourself into
another coma.

23:16.179 --> 23:17.395
Enjoy yourself.

23:26.889 --> 23:28.448
You came.

23:28.525 --> 23:29.699
You asked me to.

23:40.445 --> 23:42.912
Sheriff Valenti, you copy?

23:42.989 --> 23:45.415
Situation at the motel
was a 10-90.

23:45.491 --> 23:47.250
Clock out, Deputy,
it's midnight.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.251
Copy that.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.469
10-90?

23:49.546 --> 23:51.921
Apparently, you have
a perp in cuffs.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.598
Doesn't seem like
a false alarm to me.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.555
Am I under arrest, Sheriff?

24:00.631 --> 24:02.306
'Cause usually handcuffs come
with a matching charge.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.392
Were you in Mexico
when Noah Bracken died?

24:04.469 --> 24:07.103
You know I was.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.480
But I don't understand, Sheriff.
You know me.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.357
I do know you, Evans.

24:11.434 --> 24:15.403
And I like you.
I always have.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.165
Sometimes people
with traumatic pasts just snap.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.911
Is that what happened?
You can tell me.

24:23.988 --> 24:25.621
We'll figure it out.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.582
I don't have a traumatic past.

24:27.658 --> 24:28.842
Oh?

24:28.918 --> 24:30.835
No happy childhood includes

24:30.846 --> 24:32.846
being abandoned at age seven,

24:32.922 --> 24:34.180
naked and mute
in the desert.

24:34.257 --> 24:37.016
Those records are sealed.
June 14, 1997.

24:37.093 --> 24:38.968
I was a deputy when
I responded to the call.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.012
I was obsessed with your case.

24:41.022 --> 24:44.182
I wanted to find the scum who
left you three kids out there

24:44.192 --> 24:46.025
and make them pay.

24:46.102 --> 24:48.862
We rounded up vagrants,
we interrogated

24:48.938 --> 24:51.189
desert cult leaders.
Nothing.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.816
Isobel and I don't have
violent memories.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.526
We never showed signs of abuse.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.654
Perhaps that's true for Isobel.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.327
<i>I checked on you
at the group home.</i>

25:04.403 --> 25:06.662
<i>You were screaming
and scribbling on the walls.</i>

25:06.673 --> 25:09.290
<i>Michael tried to
settle you down.</i>

25:21.337 --> 25:23.554
That was the day
the Evanses adopted you.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.223
My parents left Michael
in that group home

25:25.233 --> 25:27.066
because he was disturbed.

25:27.143 --> 25:29.560
They thought he needed someone
who could focus on him.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.437
Michael took that crayon
from you

25:31.514 --> 25:32.688
before Ann and David walked in.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.148
He was afraid of <i> you.</i>

25:34.225 --> 25:35.575
No, you are lying.

25:35.652 --> 25:38.861
I am giving you the facts,
unpleasant as they may be.

25:38.938 --> 25:39.904
Now it's your turn.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.989
You want facts? Hmm?

25:42.066 --> 25:43.741
You are grasping at straws.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.868
Cam and Mimi, they were
missing for weeks.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.246
And Cam's sister is
in danger right <i> now.</i>

25:48.256 --> 25:50.081
And yet, you are
sitting here with me

25:50.091 --> 25:51.999
because of something you think
you saw 20 years ago.

25:54.504 --> 25:56.930
You see what I mean
about snapping?

25:58.749 --> 26:01.884
You heard of the Gunther twins?

26:01.961 --> 26:04.095
One's a bootmaker,
one's a paranoid schizophrenic.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.681
They have cameras
all over their farm.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.394
After an incident,
we found footage

26:11.470 --> 26:14.447
of Mimi DeLuca getting out
of the back of a hunting van

26:14.524 --> 26:15.990
the night she vanished.

26:18.027 --> 26:20.286
Guess she did some
shoe shopping.

26:20.363 --> 26:23.531
That same van was caught
on a traffic camera

26:23.608 --> 26:25.625
a hundred yards from where
Cameron's car was abandoned.

26:25.702 --> 26:27.034
You want to guess
the third camera

26:27.111 --> 26:28.786
that caught that
hunting van, Evans?

26:28.797 --> 26:31.080
The hotel security cams tonight.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.915
That's what I've been
saying, Sheriff. Right.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.468
What's the most common
profile for a kidnapper?

26:37.455 --> 26:39.463
White males, 28 to 40.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.091
But you can't place me at the
other two scenes. This is all...

26:42.168 --> 26:44.477
Is it true you have a sexual
history with one of the victims?

26:44.554 --> 26:46.312
That you have
issues with rage.

26:46.389 --> 26:47.689
That you have the know-how...

26:49.726 --> 26:51.234
Max.

26:53.304 --> 26:55.229
Your passport has
never been logged

26:55.306 --> 26:57.782
crossing into Mexico.

27:04.982 --> 27:07.158
Max Evans, you're under arrest.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.835
You have the right to
remain silent.

27:08.912 --> 27:10.336
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

27:10.413 --> 27:11.671
in a court of law.

27:11.748 --> 27:13.172
You have the right to
an attorney...

27:13.249 --> 27:17.168
<i>Isobel,
I need your help. Hurry.</i>

27:17.178 --> 27:19.587
It's all about the
headboard, really.

27:19.664 --> 27:22.673
Because any decent restraints
are gonna turn cheap furniture

27:22.684 --> 27:24.517
into Swedish sawdust,

27:24.594 --> 27:26.177
if your partner's
doing their job right.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.596
You know what I mean?

27:28.673 --> 27:30.181
Oh, my God. Max?

27:30.191 --> 27:31.441
What's going on?

27:31.517 --> 27:34.644
Isobel, how are you here?
I have his phone.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.146
Well, I just got
a late-night urge

27:37.223 --> 27:38.856
to support my local
law enforcement,

27:38.867 --> 27:41.868
but this is a shocking twist.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.042
You don't want to do this.

27:50.987 --> 27:51.878
Isobel.

27:51.955 --> 27:53.412
Iz, are you okay?

27:56.701 --> 27:58.209
I'm fine.

27:58.219 --> 28:01.462
I just fainted.

28:01.539 --> 28:02.630
I'm a fainter.

28:02.707 --> 28:04.557
She's a fainter.

28:04.634 --> 28:05.725
<i>We're closed!</i>

28:05.802 --> 28:08.227
Max is in serious trouble.

28:08.304 --> 28:09.261
Do you want to tell Liz

28:09.338 --> 28:11.889
how you royally boned us, Kyle?

28:11.900 --> 28:13.140
Or should I?

28:13.217 --> 28:15.068
I've been here all night.

28:15.144 --> 28:16.069
Isobel, where is Max?

28:16.145 --> 28:18.187
Kyle's mom arrested him

28:18.264 --> 28:19.981
for, I don't know,
kidnapping,

28:20.057 --> 28:21.565
or murder,
or kicking puppies.

28:21.576 --> 28:22.800
I don't know,
I couldn't tell you.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.402
I couldn't stop her,
I couldn't even begin

28:24.412 --> 28:25.569
to get into her mind.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.871
What does that have to do...

28:31.777 --> 28:33.336
What did you do?

28:34.613 --> 28:35.705
My mom was totally spiraling

28:35.781 --> 28:36.914
trying to figure out
what was going on.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.083
Not eating, not sleeping.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.043
You stole the yellow
pollen from the lab.

28:41.120 --> 28:45.256
Yes. I put it in perfume.
I gave it for her birthday.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.883
<i>She was on a collision course
with aliens, Liz.</i>

28:47.960 --> 28:49.268
<i>I had to protect her.</i>

28:49.345 --> 28:51.646
She thinks that Max killed Noah.

28:51.723 --> 28:54.724
Max did kill Noah.
She's not wrong.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.392
And I won't let you
violate her mind

28:56.469 --> 28:57.652
to make her think that she is.

28:59.764 --> 29:00.855
But there's
another solution.

29:00.931 --> 29:04.525
All right?
Just stay here, the both of you.

29:04.602 --> 29:06.077
I'll handle it.

29:07.855 --> 29:10.948
Look, I don't resent Max
for getting chosen,

29:10.959 --> 29:13.576
but if my mom
sacrificed herself

29:13.652 --> 29:16.537
to Tripp so Max could be
taken care of... Hey,

29:16.614 --> 29:19.081
what if we have
this story wrong?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.968
My dad said an alien
seduced Tripp into trusting her

29:22.045 --> 29:24.378
so that she could
exact revenge.

29:24.455 --> 29:26.630
He once said that you were
doing the same thing to me.

29:26.641 --> 29:27.631
But he was wrong.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.600
I know that you loved me.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.304
So maybe he's wrong
about Tripp.

29:33.314 --> 29:36.557
<i>Maybe the entire time,
Tripp and Nora...</i>

29:36.634 --> 29:38.309
<i>They were on the same side.</i>

29:38.319 --> 29:41.145
<i>What if they had
a real connection?</i>

29:41.156 --> 29:43.656
Maybe he was trying
to warn Walt

29:43.733 --> 29:45.566
in the diner that day.

29:45.643 --> 29:48.778
He said the raid was
in two days.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.497
He tricked an eight-year-old.
Maybe.

29:51.574 --> 29:53.249
<i>But maybe not.</i>

29:54.669 --> 29:55.659
Harlan.

29:55.670 --> 29:58.746
What's going on?

29:58.823 --> 30:00.790
We don't move on the farm
until day after tomorrow.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.417
Change of plans.
We raid tonight.

30:03.494 --> 30:04.835
On whose orders?

30:06.372 --> 30:07.671
The men are ready.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.758
You prepared to show
that alien bitch no mercy?

30:10.835 --> 30:14.345
Or, uh, is she just
a wounded deer?

30:14.355 --> 30:17.607
Don't underestimate me, Harlan.

30:19.602 --> 30:22.612
Hell, I'll take Father's gun.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.776
<i>What if the after-action report
was falsified?</i>

30:28.853 --> 30:32.038
The only thing worse
than a liar is a traitor.

30:32.115 --> 30:35.616
You have to understand...
they're just people, sir.

30:43.367 --> 30:44.792
Roy, no!

30:46.888 --> 30:48.221
Think of the child. Go. Go!

30:51.208 --> 30:53.017
All right, let's go!
No!

30:54.562 --> 30:57.563
Get her out!

31:04.430 --> 31:07.031
You hesitated, Tripp.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.402
There's nothing worse
than a traitor.

31:11.412 --> 31:14.238
She got into my head again.

31:14.249 --> 31:16.323
Lower your weapon, brother.
Think.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.826
We have to know how
they do it.

31:18.903 --> 31:20.828
We have to bring them in alive.

31:20.905 --> 31:23.038
Something isn't right.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.551
I'm a Manes man, Harlan.
I'll prove myself.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.596
Lower your weapon.

31:37.421 --> 31:39.763
Enough.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.732
You'll have your fun
with her later, boys.

32:05.783 --> 32:08.134
No!

32:08.211 --> 32:11.378
What if Tripp knew that Nora
wanted Louise protected

32:11.455 --> 32:13.047
at all costs?
Then he failed.

32:13.123 --> 32:14.599
Louise died.

32:17.294 --> 32:20.813
My mom ended up
in Caulfield, Alex.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.270
Hey.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.648
My dad always said
that justice can't be served

32:30.658 --> 32:32.650
until after
disaster has struck.

32:32.660 --> 32:33.943
But Tripp's last words to him

32:34.019 --> 32:35.819
were very different.
Tripp said

32:35.830 --> 32:37.821
that justice must not be served

32:37.832 --> 32:39.907
until after
disaster has struck.

32:39.984 --> 32:42.117
There is a world of difference
there, Guerin.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.036
What does it matter?

32:44.113 --> 32:45.880
Everybody's dead.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.467
We'll never know the truth.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.803
Look, I know
her husband died.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.806
I'm just asking, is she on
the rebound or anything?

33:03.882 --> 33:07.017
Oh, heya.
Your mom's upstairs.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.028
Thanks, Joe, uh...

33:09.105 --> 33:11.647
Actually, I...
Hoping for a minute

33:11.724 --> 33:14.075
with my old pal
here.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.121
Could use a cup of coffee, anyway.
Ah.

33:22.693 --> 33:23.826
You look...

33:23.902 --> 33:25.953
better.

33:26.030 --> 33:29.373
Yeah. Thank you.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.793
I'm grateful to you
for my sister.

33:32.870 --> 33:36.222
That's why I did what I did.

33:36.299 --> 33:38.132
And tormenting my mother
with unanswered questions

33:38.208 --> 33:40.726
isn't right.

33:40.803 --> 33:42.728
She deserves
some truth.

33:42.805 --> 33:47.066
Uh, maybe not all of it,
but... a truth.

33:48.177 --> 33:50.394
How am I supposed
to do that?

33:50.405 --> 33:52.021
Kyle?

33:52.097 --> 33:53.981
Please don't tell me you're
tangled up in all of this.

33:54.058 --> 33:55.074
Uh...

34:02.074 --> 34:05.242
Max has an alibi
for Mimi and Jenna, Mom.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.836
Listen to him.

34:12.284 --> 34:16.053
I had a heart problem, Sheriff.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.763
I was unconscious
when Mimi and Cam went missing.

34:25.773 --> 34:29.608
I didn't want to tell you
for personal reasons.

34:29.685 --> 34:33.779
I wanted to look forward.

34:33.856 --> 34:37.775
And be a force of good...

34:37.784 --> 34:41.027
in this community.

34:41.105 --> 34:45.291
I... I want to make you proud.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.960
Everything
he said is the truth.

34:56.971 --> 34:59.296
You're a good cop, Mom.

34:59.373 --> 35:02.308
But maybe tonight...

35:02.385 --> 35:04.602
just be a good person.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.640
- I'm done with that part.
- Can I marry the ketchups?

35:09.650 --> 35:11.859
Isobel Evans,
working at the diner?

35:11.936 --> 35:13.477
The fryers are
off, my friend,

35:13.488 --> 35:15.104
and I'm only turning them
back on if your day

35:15.180 --> 35:16.230
was worse than ours.

35:16.306 --> 35:18.816
I am not here for fries.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.493
Apparently, in the '80s,

35:20.569 --> 35:22.236
my Uncle Tripp
had a favorite booth here.

35:22.312 --> 35:24.780
He said he liked the way
the light hit it,

35:24.857 --> 35:26.907
but that doesn't sound like
something a Manes man would say.

35:26.984 --> 35:28.409
So I think that
there's more to it.

35:28.485 --> 35:30.285
I don't know.
I mean, there's this one booth

35:30.362 --> 35:32.079
that gets the light just right
in the afternoon.

35:32.156 --> 35:34.423
Teenagers are always
taking selfies there.

35:39.922 --> 35:42.014
Okay.
All right.

35:42.091 --> 35:44.258
I'm looking for something
that's just kind of

35:44.334 --> 35:46.593
out of place.
Something that...

35:46.670 --> 35:48.145
nobody would really notice.

35:51.175 --> 35:52.233
How about an "X"?

35:55.438 --> 35:57.405
"X" marks the spot?

36:20.162 --> 36:22.504
You think your uncle
left that here?

36:22.581 --> 36:24.306
Or somebody left
it for him.

36:26.969 --> 36:29.470
Oh, my God.

36:29.546 --> 36:31.221
That's...

36:31.232 --> 36:33.348
That's her, that's my, um...

36:33.425 --> 36:35.309
that's my mom.

36:35.385 --> 36:38.195
Look how beautiful she is.

36:39.690 --> 36:41.323
She's older.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.286
She survived the raid.

36:47.990 --> 36:49.373
She lived.

36:55.873 --> 36:58.215
"Thank you, Tripp."

36:59.418 --> 37:01.335
He wasn't hunting them.

37:01.411 --> 37:04.213
He was trying to <i> help</i> them.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.099
There's more to this story.
I know where we need to go next.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.244
Sheriff.

37:32.609 --> 37:35.410
I'll never be able to prove it,

37:35.487 --> 37:37.129
but there are
14 unsolved murders

37:37.206 --> 37:39.873
in Chaves County that I believe
Noah Bracken is responsible for.

37:39.950 --> 37:43.418
What?

37:43.495 --> 37:45.045
That's-that's insane.

37:45.122 --> 37:47.640
Drifters, teenage runaways,
the undocumented.

37:47.716 --> 37:49.975
Anyone with no one
to miss them.

37:50.052 --> 37:51.668
He killed them.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.888
Even if that were true, it
doesn't mean you can... I know.

37:54.965 --> 37:59.601
I also know that he violated
my sister for ten years.

37:59.678 --> 38:03.438
He manipulated her.
He abused her.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.774
He made her do things
she would never do.

38:05.851 --> 38:09.319
A bolt of lightning
killed my brother-in-law.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.705
And he deserved it.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.743
There are people in this county
who deserve the protection

38:16.820 --> 38:19.454
of honest police
officers like you.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.123
He wasn't one of them.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.304
I'll miss working
with you, Sheriff.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.641
When I said 6:00,

38:39.718 --> 38:41.393
I figured I'd see you
around noon.

38:45.891 --> 38:46.940
Uh...

38:48.685 --> 38:50.369
I've stolen

38:50.446 --> 38:53.989
three thousand, four hundred...

38:54.066 --> 38:56.199
and 72 dollars' worth
of copper wire from you

38:56.210 --> 38:57.835
over the last 13 years.

39:00.456 --> 39:03.382
If I start keeping real hours,

39:03.459 --> 39:05.375
and you garnish 25%
of my weekly paycheck,

39:05.386 --> 39:08.378
I'll have you paid back...
I am blind, kid.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.881
I'm not stupid.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.717
I didn't need
the damn wire.

39:15.253 --> 39:19.064
I came to the group
home twice, you know.

39:19.141 --> 39:22.643
They weren't too keen
on letting a junkyard dog

39:22.719 --> 39:26.739
who smelled like bathtub
gin adopt a child.

39:26.815 --> 39:29.408
I don't blame them.

39:29.485 --> 39:32.244
Would have messed you
up even worse.

39:32.321 --> 39:33.495
But I tried.

39:36.733 --> 39:38.250
I got one year,

39:38.327 --> 39:40.369
three months,
and four days

39:40.445 --> 39:43.246
with Miss Louise
and Miss Nora.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.707
No matter what...

39:45.784 --> 39:48.710
I can't pay you
back for that.

39:50.765 --> 39:51.963
Keep the money.

40:21.370 --> 40:22.619
Max?

40:24.781 --> 40:26.707
Are you okay?

40:26.783 --> 40:29.385
Oh, I am now that I'm with you.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.339
Oh. Ooh. What?
Uh, no, it's nothing.

40:34.350 --> 40:36.466
It's... I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

40:36.477 --> 40:40.646
but I think Charlie Cameron
has been abducted by aliens.

40:40.723 --> 40:42.431
You went after her.

40:42.441 --> 40:45.142
Uh, I don't why I can't
leave well enough alone.

40:45.152 --> 40:48.946
'Cause you're a hero.
It's in your DNA.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.567
Hey, I, uh, I
talked to Isobel.

40:53.643 --> 40:56.069
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night, too.

40:56.146 --> 40:57.487
Yeah.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.740
You want coffee?

40:59.816 --> 41:02.576
No. I want sleep.

41:02.652 --> 41:05.996
Hours and hours of sleep.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.397
You can join me?

41:07.399 --> 41:09.082
We can talk after.
I'll make <i> you</i> coffee.

41:09.159 --> 41:11.677
How about that?
Mm... I just need to close up.

41:11.754 --> 41:14.171
Or... open up.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.423
Oh. Honestly, I don't think

41:16.500 --> 41:19.926
I'm ever gonna escape
this diner.

41:22.857 --> 41:25.482
I'll see you as soon
as you're done, okay?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
