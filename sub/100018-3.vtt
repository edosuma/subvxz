[Rachel]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.457 --> 00:26.108
Titans are back, bitches!
Whoo!

00:29.332 --> 00:32.469
[Dawn]
What's wrong with him?

00:32.503 --> 00:34.987
- We gotta go.
- Ellis! No! We have to help him!

00:38.299 --> 00:39.974
Dawn and I just got a visit
from Dr. Light.

00:39.975 --> 00:41.044
I thought
he was still in prison.

00:41.045 --> 00:42.393
Get down!

00:48.051 --> 00:51.859
I'm not the same person
I used to be.

00:53.990 --> 00:55.625
[Faddei] Hello, Ms. Koriand'r.

00:55.658 --> 00:57.359
Surprised to see me?

00:58.661 --> 00:59.463
[moans]

00:59.464 --> 01:01.863
Sorry about that,
Your Highness.

01:01.865 --> 01:03.564
[Rachel] Who the hell is that?

01:10.742 --> 01:11.742
[Gar] "Rose Wilson."

01:11.743 --> 01:14.243
And that's her dad,
Slade Wilson.

01:14.277 --> 01:18.048
[Jason] No fucking way.

01:18.081 --> 01:19.882
Deathstroke.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.998
- That's Rose's father?
- [Jason] Yep.

01:34.030 --> 01:36.198
The one and only Deathstroke.

01:36.233 --> 01:39.036
[Rachel] Is that
somebody you know?

01:39.037 --> 01:42.206
Kind of.
Old Titans business.

01:42.239 --> 01:43.372
[Gar] Check it.

01:43.373 --> 01:46.277
Former Delta Force commando,
part of H.I.V.E.

01:46.311 --> 01:52.025
"Select soldiers who underwent a series
of experimental bio-enhancements."

01:52.683 --> 01:55.552
Huh. Out of
the 35 trial subjects,

01:55.585 --> 01:58.155
the only one to survive
was Slade Wilson.

01:58.189 --> 02:02.359
INTERPOL says he retired years ago
after the death of his son, Jericho.

02:02.393 --> 02:03.859
I tried having
the computer find...

02:03.893 --> 02:07.343
I'll take it from here.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.377
- [alarm sounding]
- [security system] Security alert. Main entrance.

02:12.401 --> 02:14.236
<i>Access denied.</i>

02:14.270 --> 02:15.306
[Dick sighs]

02:15.337 --> 02:16.639
<i>So I guess
you changed the code.</i>

02:16.671 --> 02:17.907
[chuckles softly]

02:17.942 --> 02:19.140
Finally.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.325
You guys have no idea
how much this place misses you.

02:35.358 --> 02:37.526
This place, huh?

02:37.561 --> 02:40.097
- Mostly just me.
- And me too.

02:40.129 --> 02:43.000
[Dawn] Hey.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.656
So where's Kory?

02:44.657 --> 02:47.170
She sort of vanished.

02:47.171 --> 02:49.907
- What do you mean by "vanished"?
- [Donna] I don't know.

02:49.939 --> 02:51.908
She's not answering her phone.

02:51.942 --> 02:53.144
[sighs]

02:53.176 --> 02:55.479
But, you know, she mentioned
she wanted to see Florida.

02:55.512 --> 02:57.613
So, I just figured
she made an Irish exit

02:57.614 --> 02:59.782
and took a quick little trip.

02:59.817 --> 03:01.183
[footsteps]

03:01.217 --> 03:03.051
Were you followed?

03:03.086 --> 03:05.455
We shell gamed
before we knocked.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.257
Covered our tracks.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.390
Can you guys
give us a minute, please?

03:17.001 --> 03:19.251
You too, Jason.

03:24.342 --> 03:27.243
I wish the circumstances
were better, but...

03:27.276 --> 03:28.979
[sighs] Welcome home.

03:29.014 --> 03:32.181
- You okay?
- Better now that you're all here.

03:32.215 --> 03:35.018
Two attacks in two days.

03:35.051 --> 03:36.399
Did you find out anything?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.787
Nothing you guys
don't already know.

03:37.788 --> 03:40.625
Dr. Light's out of prison.
Someone broke him out.

03:40.657 --> 03:42.758
There's been a trail of
dead bodies ever since.

03:42.759 --> 03:43.561
[Dawn] We know.

03:43.562 --> 03:45.161
He killed a friend.

03:45.194 --> 03:47.163
[huffs] Yeah. I'm sorry.

03:47.197 --> 03:49.664
Thanks to
Robin-two-point-whatever,

03:49.665 --> 03:52.137
that little TV announcement
put a target on our back.

03:52.169 --> 03:54.772
Whatever the reason, Arthur
Light's on a payback mission.

03:54.806 --> 03:56.540
He was trying to
pick us off one by one.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.776
So, chances are,
he's after us all now.

03:58.808 --> 04:01.343
But we're together
and we're strong.

04:01.344 --> 04:04.580
Save the rah-rah speech
for the JV squad.

04:04.615 --> 04:07.651
We'll take care of Dr. Light
and then we're out.

04:07.683 --> 04:09.752
Hank and I need to
get back home, Dick.

04:09.786 --> 04:11.389
[Donna] Me too.

04:11.421 --> 04:13.923
I can't stay here.

04:13.957 --> 04:16.494
I understand.

04:16.526 --> 04:19.963
All right, good talk.
Let's do this.

04:19.995 --> 04:21.831
Same rooms?

04:21.863 --> 04:25.468
Same rooms.

04:25.502 --> 04:29.473
Oh, and guys...

04:29.507 --> 04:31.507
[sighs] One more thing.

04:32.911 --> 04:35.413
Picked her up the day before yesterday.
She was on the run.

04:35.444 --> 04:37.648
The evasive technique
was impressive.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.016
She has talent and training.

04:40.050 --> 04:44.250
[sighs] And then I saw this.

04:46.122 --> 04:48.259
Fuck me.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.994
- I thought he...
- He was dead.

04:50.026 --> 04:51.461
Yeah, we all did.

04:51.495 --> 04:55.198
But he's alive and well
in San Francisco.

04:55.199 --> 04:58.000
So, who is she?

04:58.033 --> 05:00.870
Her name is Rose.

05:00.903 --> 05:03.574
Wilson.

05:03.608 --> 05:05.242
Deathstroke's daughter.

05:05.276 --> 05:07.709
You have Slade Wilson's
daughter in the other room?

05:07.711 --> 05:09.413
You're fucking
with us, right?

05:09.447 --> 05:11.448
I didn't know who she was
when I picked her up.

05:11.449 --> 05:12.883
And now you do
and she's still here.

05:12.884 --> 05:14.149
Yeah, obviously
it's a concern.

05:14.184 --> 05:15.954
A concern? It's pathological.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.253
Dick, I get that you have
a soft spot for strays,

05:18.254 --> 05:19.789
but she can't stay here.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.325
Deathstroke is why
we shuttered this place.

05:22.326 --> 05:24.161
We limped away.

05:24.194 --> 05:25.329
I didn't come for round two.

05:25.362 --> 05:26.629
I didn't forget.

05:26.663 --> 05:27.849
But I can't kick her out.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.398
Slade's tried to kill her once,
he'll do it again.

05:29.399 --> 05:31.803
You don't think
we're past that?

05:31.836 --> 05:34.737
You don't think the same camera that saw
you pick her up saw you bring her here?

05:34.738 --> 05:36.405
He doesn't know she's here.
I covered my tracks.

05:36.406 --> 05:38.040
And I'm not kicking her out.

05:38.074 --> 05:39.208
Okay, look,

05:39.209 --> 05:41.210
we're here for Dr. Light,
let's take care of Dr. Light.

05:41.211 --> 05:42.911
The girl is my problem.

05:46.884 --> 05:50.584
Well, so much for
old home week.

05:50.687 --> 05:53.838
[theme music playing]

06:07.738 --> 06:12.042
- [clattering on TV]
- [Daffy Duck exclaiming]

06:12.043 --> 06:13.708
[Daffy Duck] <i>Guess who
gets to clean this up?</i>

06:13.709 --> 06:15.345
- [cartoon character] <i>Not bad, camel man.</i>
- [chuckles]

06:15.346 --> 06:20.346
- [clattering on TV]
- [Daffy Duck] <i>But not good enough.</i>

06:20.517 --> 06:23.387
[grunts]

06:23.420 --> 06:25.023
Yeah, I had a feeling
you'd try that.

06:25.055 --> 06:27.557
- You need to let me go.
- [Faddei] Hold on.

06:27.591 --> 06:28.959
It's almost over.

06:28.992 --> 06:31.596
- [Daffy Duck speaking indistinctly]
- [Faddei chuckles]

06:31.627 --> 06:35.127
[grunts] I love that guy.
He kills me every time.

06:36.668 --> 06:38.400
You were saying?

06:38.401 --> 06:41.104
- Let me go.
- Oh.

06:41.105 --> 06:44.108
First things first...

06:44.141 --> 06:47.377
you've been served.

06:47.411 --> 06:51.180
It says you are to come home at
once and take your royal turn.

06:51.214 --> 06:53.350
Wear the crown.

06:53.384 --> 06:56.653
There's some stuff about family
obligation and general disappointment,

06:56.687 --> 06:59.156
but if you don't
adhere to the request,

06:59.189 --> 07:01.925
a second round of guys
like me will appear.

07:01.959 --> 07:04.709
Guys who aren't
as civilized as me.

07:09.165 --> 07:10.600
Remove them.

07:10.634 --> 07:13.502
A guy travels 20 million miles
to give you a lift home,

07:13.538 --> 07:15.572
and you want to
get royal on me?

07:15.605 --> 07:18.305
Don't make me ask you again.

07:22.779 --> 07:26.115
A room with a park view
was not easy to get.

07:26.149 --> 07:27.317
I'd hate to burn it down.

07:27.350 --> 07:28.552
Do you have a better idea?

07:28.584 --> 07:32.355
- [knocking on door]
- [man] Room service.

07:32.389 --> 07:34.639
Have you eaten?

07:39.428 --> 07:42.598
[knock on door, door opens]

07:42.632 --> 07:45.302
Were you planning
on telling me?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.504
- What?
- About your father.

07:47.538 --> 07:50.875
Telling people who my father
is usually doesn't end well.

07:50.908 --> 07:52.009
Daddy's not well-liked.

07:52.043 --> 07:53.709
What's he doing here
in San Francisco?

07:53.711 --> 07:55.077
We didn't do
a lot of catching up.

07:55.079 --> 07:58.281
- You two have a falling out?
- More like a family spat.

07:58.314 --> 08:01.651
Nothing a team of army
psychologists couldn't mediate.

08:01.685 --> 08:02.919
Or medicate.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.654
What about?

08:04.687 --> 08:07.723
He killed my brother.

08:07.759 --> 08:09.826
He said big brother
fell in with the wrong crowd.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.428
When did this happen?

08:12.463 --> 08:16.399
Four or so years ago.

08:16.434 --> 08:18.036
So why are you
going after him now?

08:18.069 --> 08:20.012
I heard he was back in town, so I
went to take care of my business.

08:20.036 --> 08:22.005
[scoffs]
It didn't go so well.

08:22.038 --> 08:24.975
I still have
one good eye left.

08:25.009 --> 08:29.211
He'd be dead already if you
hadn't dragged me up here.

08:29.245 --> 08:30.913
[sighs]

08:30.947 --> 08:32.716
Who are the new people?

08:32.750 --> 08:34.317
I heard voices.

08:34.350 --> 08:35.553
Old friends.

08:35.586 --> 08:38.855
Are these friends you let out
or ones you make stay here?

08:38.889 --> 08:40.423
Friends who have
come here to help.

08:40.456 --> 08:42.725
They come in handy sometimes.

08:42.759 --> 08:44.710
So will this.

08:48.063 --> 08:49.864
[door closes]

08:51.402 --> 08:53.336
[Gar] Ready?

08:53.369 --> 08:56.807
Ready.

08:56.841 --> 08:59.710
- [neck cracks]
- Let's go.

08:59.743 --> 09:01.844
[all grunting]

09:41.652 --> 09:45.402
Houston, we have contact!

09:47.456 --> 09:50.756
Are we still sparring?

09:54.563 --> 09:55.614
Rachel.

10:03.974 --> 10:04.974
Rach.

10:11.514 --> 10:14.051
Rachel, stop!

10:14.082 --> 10:16.653
[grunts]

10:16.686 --> 10:21.259
[gasping]

10:21.292 --> 10:24.193
You stay away from me,
you fucking freak.

10:24.227 --> 10:25.461
[footsteps approach]

10:25.495 --> 10:30.466
[Dick] Everything okay?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.403
No, it's not.

10:32.436 --> 10:34.303
Look, I don't like being
left out of whatever plans

10:34.304 --> 10:36.037
you relics are cooking up
out there, all right?

10:36.038 --> 10:38.508
[scoffs] You didn't
miss anything.

10:38.509 --> 10:40.477
Gar. I need you.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.211
And what about me?

10:42.245 --> 10:44.644
Keep practicing.

10:49.186 --> 10:51.385
You need to have
that shit looked at.

10:51.386 --> 10:53.287
By, like, a fucking priest.

11:01.765 --> 11:05.970
So the concierge downstairs told me that
Michelin gave this place two stars.

11:06.003 --> 11:07.770
I don't get the whole
tire-food connection,

11:07.804 --> 11:10.274
but hey,
I'm from out of town.

11:10.306 --> 11:12.509
Oh.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.979
These are yours.

11:16.014 --> 11:18.447
You really know
how to treat a girl.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.519
Not just a girl. My queen.

11:21.551 --> 11:23.053
Are we really back to that?

11:23.086 --> 11:25.822
Twenty years in the Royal
Protection service. Born and bred.

11:25.855 --> 11:26.889
Old habits die hard.

11:26.923 --> 11:29.461
- You call this protecting me?
- No.

11:29.493 --> 11:32.828
I call this two old friends
having dinner.

11:32.863 --> 11:35.099
But I am here to ensure
your safe return home.

11:35.131 --> 11:37.433
It's your choice
to comply or not.

11:37.466 --> 11:41.971
[cell phone chiming]

11:42.005 --> 11:45.408
I gotta make a phone call.

11:45.442 --> 11:47.077
Don't make me chase.

11:47.110 --> 11:49.546
[cell phone beeps, line rings]

11:49.578 --> 11:50.813
Donna, it's Kory.

11:50.846 --> 11:54.283
So, I guess ghosting
is an intergalactic thing.

11:54.318 --> 11:57.153
[Kory] <i>I'm sorry.
I ran into an interruption.</i>

11:57.187 --> 11:58.554
What kind of interruption?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.158
- A guy I know.
<i>- Oh.</i>

12:00.190 --> 12:03.094
Is that what we're
calling them now, "interruptions"?

12:03.126 --> 12:05.128
- Are you still in the city?
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

12:05.162 --> 12:07.630
We're all in Titans Tower.

12:07.663 --> 12:10.368
<i>- Family reunion?
- I wish.</i>

12:10.402 --> 12:13.437
A guy named Arthur Light
busted out of prison.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.871
Nearly killed Hank and Dawn,
then Dick.

12:15.907 --> 12:17.241
Is everyone okay?

12:17.274 --> 12:20.110
Yeah, we're all right,
but there are casualties.

12:20.144 --> 12:22.581
<i>- It's a bloody shit show.
- Do you need me?</i>

12:22.613 --> 12:26.850
I think we can handle it,
but I'll let you know.

12:26.884 --> 12:30.354
<i>- How's Rachel?
- Asking about you.</i>

12:30.386 --> 12:33.255
Keep an eye on her, will you?
She needs special care.

12:33.288 --> 12:35.859
Yeah, will do.

12:35.893 --> 12:37.660
I gotta go.

12:37.693 --> 12:39.264
Call me if you need me.

12:39.296 --> 12:41.465
Have fun with
your interruption.

12:41.496 --> 12:43.596
Mm, thank you.

12:49.005 --> 12:51.808
Room service is expensive.
Did you rob a bank?

12:51.841 --> 12:55.879
No. I found these
in the bottom of your bag.

12:55.912 --> 12:58.149
Nice.

12:58.181 --> 13:01.018
Looks like you did some research
on the local ding customs.

13:01.051 --> 13:03.053
Yeah, it was a long flight.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.836
I splurged for the Wi-Fi.

13:08.649 --> 13:11.427
Did my parents send you?

13:11.461 --> 13:13.928
Your sister. Blackfire.

13:13.929 --> 13:16.301
[chuckles]
Of course, of course.

13:16.332 --> 13:21.332
Of all the royal guards, she sends
the only one that I slept with.

13:21.504 --> 13:23.605
No, she didn't choose me.

13:23.639 --> 13:26.043
No?

13:26.076 --> 13:28.176
I volunteered.

13:38.355 --> 13:41.792
I don't think
we got introduced.

13:41.826 --> 13:44.461
Rachel.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.898
I'm Rose.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.666
Pretty name.

13:48.667 --> 13:49.667
Yeah.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.236
Maybe too pretty now.

13:52.269 --> 13:54.671
"Patch" has
a nice ring to it.

13:54.703 --> 13:58.475
[clicks tongue]

13:58.509 --> 14:01.178
I don't get this,
the whole living situation.

14:01.211 --> 14:03.712
Is it some kind of
Euro hostel or something?

14:03.746 --> 14:08.746
[chuckles] No,
we're just friends.

14:09.452 --> 14:11.318
I saw what happened.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.423
Saw what?

14:12.456 --> 14:15.457
Dick has access to the city's
surveillance cameras.

14:15.491 --> 14:18.796
I saw everything.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.764
Guy with the sword?

14:20.797 --> 14:22.264
My dad.

14:22.298 --> 14:24.234
I'm sorry.

14:24.269 --> 14:28.238
No "Dad of the Year" mug
for him.

14:28.273 --> 14:31.298
That thing in
your forehead, it's...

14:31.299 --> 14:32.299
Bold choice.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.046
[sighs] Not my choice.

14:35.077 --> 14:37.380
My dad put it there for me.

14:37.413 --> 14:38.982
Where is he?

14:39.014 --> 14:40.417
I got rid of him.

14:40.451 --> 14:43.820
Got rid of, as in...
killed him?

14:43.854 --> 14:46.990
Yeah, kind of. [chuckles]

14:47.024 --> 14:49.292
Is that what
you wanna do to yours?

14:49.326 --> 14:50.961
I did.

14:50.995 --> 14:55.995
But, uh, you know, I thought everything
would be different if he just went away.

14:57.134 --> 15:00.002
Doesn't always work.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.836
Guess we're both members
of the bad dads club.

15:01.837 --> 15:03.139
Platinum members.

15:03.173 --> 15:06.710
- Benefits kinda suck.
- Members are pretty cool.

15:06.743 --> 15:09.293
[chuckles softly]

15:12.984 --> 15:16.452
[Dick] Dr. Light will need to refuel
if he's planning another attack.

15:16.453 --> 15:17.854
He'll need a large
electric power cell

15:17.855 --> 15:20.823
and a light source where
he can absorb the energy.

15:20.857 --> 15:22.859
So, monitor the power grids

15:22.860 --> 15:25.162
and keep an eye out
for any unusual disturbances.

15:25.195 --> 15:27.898
We find where he's pulling
the power from, we find him.

15:27.931 --> 15:29.366
Okay, got it.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.602
Oh, hey, uh,
everything okay with Rachel?

15:31.635 --> 15:34.504
She looked a little strange
in training.

15:34.537 --> 15:35.572
Yeah, yeah.

15:35.605 --> 15:39.176
That was just her...
training face. [chuckles]

15:39.210 --> 15:40.845
Training face?

15:40.878 --> 15:45.548
She just wants to be ready in case
any of the old Titans want to spar.

15:45.581 --> 15:46.649
After they settle in.

15:46.683 --> 15:48.251
They're not gonna settle in.

15:48.285 --> 15:51.288
Hank and Dawn, and Donna,
they're not staying.

15:51.322 --> 15:55.192
Did something happen
between you guys?

15:55.225 --> 15:58.995
Keep looking.

15:59.028 --> 16:02.131
[can cracks open]

16:02.166 --> 16:05.369
Five years in the stir.

16:05.403 --> 16:07.903
Nothing but prison pruno.

16:07.937 --> 16:09.672
That's always warm as piss.

16:09.706 --> 16:12.076
But this, this is freedom.

16:12.109 --> 16:15.443
It's cold, it's cheap,
it's abundant.

16:15.479 --> 16:17.878
[gulping loudly]

16:25.520 --> 16:26.822
[exhales]

16:26.855 --> 16:30.059
[burps]

16:30.094 --> 16:31.443
Question.

16:35.232 --> 16:40.232
[clears throat] You're
a professional killer, right?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.739
Hmm?

16:42.773 --> 16:45.009
Titans.

16:45.042 --> 16:47.577
What's the plan?

16:47.610 --> 16:49.581
- Plan?
- Mm.

16:49.613 --> 16:51.648
Meaning, now that
they're all together,

16:51.649 --> 16:53.215
are we gonna pick 'em off
one at a time,

16:53.216 --> 16:57.753
or take 'em all
out in one blast, or...

16:57.754 --> 16:59.724
Neither.

16:59.756 --> 17:02.725
Well, you didn't break me out
to give 'em tanning sessions.

17:02.759 --> 17:04.894
We put them in crisis.

17:04.929 --> 17:07.095
See how they operate.

17:07.096 --> 17:11.666
Who commands.
Who follows.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.871
And then?

17:13.903 --> 17:16.873
We cull the herd.

17:16.906 --> 17:20.010
Isolate the weak.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.277
The rest come to us.

17:22.278 --> 17:25.480
Okay, you wanna
mind-fuck 'em.

17:25.515 --> 17:28.452
I'm game.

17:28.483 --> 17:29.953
As long as
we make 'em suffer.

17:29.988 --> 17:34.657
They took five years from me
and they need to pay for that.

17:34.692 --> 17:37.961
I'm glad we see
eye to eye on this matter.

17:37.996 --> 17:40.174
Well, given that you've only got
one, we fuckin' better, right?

17:40.198 --> 17:43.566
[laughing]

17:43.567 --> 17:44.468
[laughing stops]

17:44.469 --> 17:48.738
[stammers] That was a joke.
I was...

17:48.770 --> 17:51.440
I see that.

17:51.474 --> 17:53.943
[laughs]

17:53.978 --> 17:55.678
Okay, I get
what you did there.

17:55.679 --> 17:57.314
"I see that." Okay.

17:57.346 --> 17:59.750
I like that. [chuckles]

17:59.782 --> 18:02.685
Okay.

18:02.720 --> 18:06.420
Let's see how much these Titans
like being back together.

18:09.925 --> 18:13.826
It's time to light 'em up.

18:30.381 --> 18:34.730
Somebody getting crazy ideas?

18:36.653 --> 18:38.821
I know I didn't wanna
come back here,

18:38.823 --> 18:42.625
wear the suit again.

18:42.626 --> 18:47.626
But this place
has a special power.

18:48.265 --> 18:53.202
Maybe things will be
different this time.

18:53.237 --> 18:57.239
That's what every addict says.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.240
Right.

19:08.751 --> 19:12.390
What we are isn't as
important as what we're not.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.925
And we're not this anymore.

19:15.961 --> 19:20.564
Says the lady who likes
to super-hero at night.

19:20.596 --> 19:21.898
In secret.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.266
I'm sorry.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.336
I should've told you.

19:26.368 --> 19:29.207
Or invited me.

19:29.240 --> 19:34.240
You can't put the suit on without
using, Hank. We've tried that.

19:34.310 --> 19:39.250
I know, but...

19:39.282 --> 19:41.082
I miss this.

19:47.090 --> 19:49.358
Everybody needs
a higher purpose.

19:49.393 --> 19:54.096
Maybe hoof and saddle
maintenance isn't enough.

19:54.131 --> 19:56.431
You've barely
given it a chance.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.641
We're moving forward,
not backward.

20:12.750 --> 20:17.555
Horse ranchers.

20:17.587 --> 20:21.038
The sooner, the better.

20:23.795 --> 20:27.162
- They don't know.
- Know what?

20:27.163 --> 20:28.532
That they're
walking with royalty.

20:28.565 --> 20:30.601
They should walk on
the other side of the street.

20:30.634 --> 20:32.903
At least muster
a little differential posture.

20:32.938 --> 20:37.474
Out here, kings and queens, pimps and
paupers, everyone walks together.

20:37.507 --> 20:39.778
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

20:39.809 --> 20:43.011
You like the anonymity,
don't you?

20:43.046 --> 20:45.515
I like making decisions,
for one.

20:45.549 --> 20:49.787
I wake up, I decide what
to eat, what to wear.

20:49.818 --> 20:52.489
What to buy.

20:52.522 --> 20:54.291
[Faddei] It's fit for a queen.

20:54.324 --> 20:55.826
It's a little royal,
isn't it?

20:55.858 --> 20:57.493
Is that so bad?

20:57.528 --> 21:01.498
Tamaranean royalty is a
smelly bog of preening boobs

21:01.531 --> 21:04.367
only interested in serving
their personal appetites.

21:04.402 --> 21:06.470
Yeah. And here?

21:06.502 --> 21:08.640
Yeah, they're in the midst
of some growing pains.

21:08.672 --> 21:10.507
Our system isn't perfect,

21:10.540 --> 21:13.242
but our leaders are family,
our family.

21:13.277 --> 21:14.845
And nobody
does weddings better.

21:14.877 --> 21:17.948
That is if you marry
within your class.

21:17.982 --> 21:20.617
Here, you can choose whatever
romantic partner you like

21:20.652 --> 21:22.787
despite their station.

21:22.819 --> 21:26.122
- So, you and I?
- Perfectly legal.

21:26.156 --> 21:28.791
- That is, if I liked you.
- Ah, okay.

21:28.826 --> 21:31.528
And I have no say
in the matter.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.832
You have to prove yourself.

21:34.864 --> 21:36.814
Prove myself.

21:43.038 --> 21:46.788
- [alarm wailing]
- Faddei!

21:49.046 --> 21:50.614
A queen deserves
to look like a queen.

21:50.647 --> 21:53.550
Did you not read the part
in the manual about laws?

21:53.583 --> 21:55.452
Honestly, I never got past
the food and wine.

21:55.484 --> 21:59.855
God. Let's get out
of the city, you're crazy.

21:59.890 --> 22:02.589
[kettle whistling]

22:09.800 --> 22:12.470
- [Donna] Any luck?
- Gar is searching the power grid.

22:12.501 --> 22:14.902
If Dr. Light powers up,
we'll find him.

22:19.809 --> 22:23.580
- What are you doing?
- Searching for power sources.

22:23.613 --> 22:26.015
I mean, coming back here.

22:26.049 --> 22:27.719
Starting all this again?

22:27.751 --> 22:28.920
It's like willful amnesia.

22:28.952 --> 22:31.587
[chuckles lightly]
That was a long time ago.

22:31.622 --> 22:33.857
- Everything's changed. I've changed.
- Changed how?

22:33.891 --> 22:36.059
You burned the suit,
you're not Robin anymore,

22:36.092 --> 22:37.461
so, what now?

22:37.493 --> 22:39.328
You're Dick Grayson,
camp counselor?

22:39.329 --> 22:41.732
- This isn't summer camp.
- Exactly.

22:41.765 --> 22:44.367
You made them Titans.

22:44.368 --> 22:46.036
Do they even know
what happened last time?

22:46.037 --> 22:48.270
I'm training them to be
a better version of us.

22:48.305 --> 22:50.807
- Write their own history.
- Ah.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.509
The kinder,
gentler Titans, huh?

22:52.541 --> 22:56.078
What's your problem?

22:56.113 --> 22:57.614
I'm sorry.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.750
You know I love you
and I want you to be happy,

22:59.782 --> 23:02.685
but there's ghosts
in this place.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.622
- They should know that.
- They know enough.

23:04.653 --> 23:07.257
You wanna teach them
to be better than us?

23:07.290 --> 23:09.326
Tell them what happened,

23:09.358 --> 23:11.162
our sins,
so they won't repeat them.

23:11.194 --> 23:13.005
Thanks for the tip. I'm
sorry you can't stay around

23:13.029 --> 23:15.500
and lead the campfire stories
about how I fucked up.

23:15.532 --> 23:19.604
It wasn't just you.

23:19.635 --> 23:22.471
You've got Slade's daughter.

23:22.472 --> 23:23.941
Sooner or later,
he'll come knocking.

23:23.942 --> 23:25.409
Donna, we have
a lot of enemies.

23:25.410 --> 23:27.120
Arthur Light, for one. He's our
main problem at the moment.

23:27.144 --> 23:31.449
[sighs] Slade Wilson's right
behind him, and when he comes...

23:31.482 --> 23:35.586
I just hope that Dick Grayson, camp
counselor, isn't who answers the door.

23:35.618 --> 23:39.122
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Gar] Uh, Dick,

23:39.154 --> 23:42.154
I think I got something.

23:42.193 --> 23:44.394
There was nothing irregular
in the main grid,

23:44.426 --> 23:47.531
so I started searching
the private lines,

23:47.564 --> 23:49.599
and then this.

23:49.634 --> 23:51.801
It doesn't look like
enough power for Dr. Light,

23:51.836 --> 23:53.671
but it's centered around
that location.

23:53.703 --> 23:55.439
It's a switching station.

23:55.471 --> 23:57.407
Kind of like a back door
into the grid.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.409
[automated voice]
<i>Main power interrupted.</i>

23:59.442 --> 24:02.042
<i>Auxiliary power engaged.</i>

24:04.948 --> 24:06.349
[Gar] The city's blacking out.

24:06.384 --> 24:09.220
[Dick] It's Dr. Light.
He's redirecting the energy,

24:09.252 --> 24:13.790
looking for a light
delivery system to refuel.

24:13.824 --> 24:15.291
[power switch thuds]

24:15.326 --> 24:17.126
How about a stadium?

24:17.162 --> 24:20.029
Lit up five minutes ago. He's gonna
use the stadium to recharge.

24:20.064 --> 24:22.000
He's a grandiose motherfucker,
isn't he?

24:22.032 --> 24:24.033
- It's a challenge.
- Or a trap.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.828
What he doesn't know
is that we're all here.

24:25.829 --> 24:27.003
He's asking for
a party of one.

24:27.005 --> 24:29.172
Well, let's give him
a party of four.

24:29.205 --> 24:30.574
What, we're on the move?

24:30.607 --> 24:31.708
Yeah, to Omaha.

24:31.742 --> 24:33.376
We'll drop you off
at the bus station.

24:33.412 --> 24:35.845
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
We'll handle it.

24:35.846 --> 24:37.646
Look, I didn't come here
to empty the dishwasher.

24:37.647 --> 24:40.684
At least let me run
interference or something.

24:40.717 --> 24:43.185
Not this time.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.388
I can help.

24:44.390 --> 24:46.689
I'll do whatever you say,
but don't leave me behind, man.

24:46.690 --> 24:49.516
You'll get your time.
Not tonight.

24:56.733 --> 24:58.635
Costume Friday?

24:58.667 --> 24:59.719
[sighs]

25:14.951 --> 25:16.300
[exhales]

25:22.192 --> 25:25.340
[electricity surging]

25:27.529 --> 25:30.366
Headed towards the field.
Section 9.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.701
Section 24.

25:31.734 --> 25:32.769
Section 16.

25:32.804 --> 25:37.804
Moving into position
in Section 2.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.540
[grunting]

25:45.817 --> 25:48.366
[grunting loudly]

25:56.259 --> 25:58.260
[groans]

25:58.295 --> 26:00.897
[exhales]

26:00.931 --> 26:05.931
I'm glad you could make it!
[echoing]

26:07.636 --> 26:09.073
All of you.

26:09.105 --> 26:14.105
- [comms beeps]
- So much for the "party of four" surprise.

26:19.382 --> 26:20.786
Anybody?

26:20.818 --> 26:23.458
I've got a visual. He's heading
toward the southern concourse exit.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.585
Dick, get down!

26:50.814 --> 26:53.550
[Hank] I got this.
Cut him off on the other side.

26:53.583 --> 26:54.782
[grunts]

27:00.523 --> 27:01.724
Hank.

27:01.759 --> 27:04.693
I'm fine.

27:04.729 --> 27:06.628
He's headed to Buchanan.

27:07.230 --> 27:08.930
[Donna] Got him.

27:22.645 --> 27:24.648
- [grunts]
- I got him.

27:24.681 --> 27:29.385
[Donna] Dick.

27:29.420 --> 27:32.269
[bus brake hissing]

27:43.201 --> 27:46.502
Do you remember
that story they told us, uh,

27:46.537 --> 27:47.903
at Easailin?

27:47.939 --> 27:49.038
<i>The Three Moons?</i>

27:49.073 --> 27:52.443
- That was a long time ago.
- Mmm.

27:52.476 --> 27:54.310
You know, I watched you
recite it by heart.

27:54.345 --> 27:57.647
I recited a lot of
stories by heart.

27:57.681 --> 27:59.082
They turned us
into little robots.

27:59.116 --> 28:01.519
Yeah. Well, you were
never a little robot.

28:01.550 --> 28:03.252
Hmm.

28:03.287 --> 28:06.990
Neither were you.
That's what I liked about you.

28:07.023 --> 28:08.525
You broke the rules.

28:08.558 --> 28:10.193
Well... [sighs]

28:10.228 --> 28:13.330
I was just trying
to impress you.

28:13.364 --> 28:18.364
I thought you would be
a queen for the ages.

28:19.568 --> 28:21.471
I still do.

28:21.505 --> 28:24.007
What do you know about it?

28:24.041 --> 28:26.042
Some people spend
their whole lives preparing,

28:26.076 --> 28:29.078
only to run away
when their turn is called.

28:29.113 --> 28:32.750
It is your destiny
to be a queen.

28:32.782 --> 28:35.184
We all have one.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.988
But it's your duty
to embrace yours.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.990
To be what you were
meant to be.

28:40.023 --> 28:44.126
To not follow it...

28:44.162 --> 28:48.465
is to let others
keep you down.

28:48.500 --> 28:53.500
When I look at you,
all I see is greatness.

28:57.674 --> 29:02.644
What happens
if you return without me?

29:02.680 --> 29:03.913
Hadn't thought about it.

29:03.948 --> 29:05.250
- Really?
- No.

29:05.282 --> 29:08.853
A royal guard returns
without his charge.

29:08.885 --> 29:12.484
That's a death sentence.

29:14.023 --> 29:15.492
Look, I didn't think
anybody else

29:15.527 --> 29:18.662
had a chance in hell
of bringing you back home.

29:18.694 --> 29:21.297
No, I should have
left you alone,

29:21.298 --> 29:24.402
but hey, I'm that guy
who raises his hand.

29:24.434 --> 29:28.671
The guy who thinks
one night together mattered.

29:28.705 --> 29:30.875
Yeah, I'm that guy too.

29:30.907 --> 29:33.742
You really put me
in a difficult spot, Faddei.

29:33.778 --> 29:37.480
Yeah, I'm sorry.
But we need you back home.

29:37.513 --> 29:39.849
Look, if you don't return,

29:39.884 --> 29:42.853
I won't be the only one
who suffers.

29:42.885 --> 29:47.885
You really know
how to ruin a girl's vacation.

29:52.663 --> 29:55.663
[Donna] I'll get some gauze
from the infirmary.

30:06.509 --> 30:09.346
[Hank] You had a chance.

30:09.381 --> 30:11.082
He would've killed
everyone on the bus.

30:11.114 --> 30:12.717
And he's gonna kill
how many more now?

30:12.750 --> 30:15.684
- I'll get him.
- Maybe you've lost the taste for how this works.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.854
We'll get another shot.

30:16.855 --> 30:18.420
The old Robin would've
taken the first one.

30:18.421 --> 30:20.157
Hank. Hey.

30:20.190 --> 30:23.760
Hey. That's enough.

30:23.792 --> 30:24.992
Come on.

30:28.965 --> 30:31.403
- [Jason] Where's Dr. Light?
- [Rachel] Jason.

30:31.434 --> 30:36.373
[Jason] Little stealth job on a
guy who shoots, what, head lamps?

30:36.407 --> 30:39.710
I mean, half the city's on fire
and still no sign of Dr. Light.

30:39.742 --> 30:40.943
Not the time, Jason.

30:40.978 --> 30:43.680
Look, I don't take orders
from you anymore, man.

30:43.712 --> 30:47.012
I do what I want,
when I want.

30:48.786 --> 30:49.818
Get out of my way.

30:49.854 --> 30:52.689
I think you got it all wrong.

30:52.721 --> 30:56.961
You're in my way.

30:56.992 --> 31:01.992
Maybe you need to see
a retirement package, huh?

31:02.866 --> 31:05.836
[knuckles crack]

31:05.868 --> 31:07.502
Don't.

31:07.537 --> 31:12.442
[grunts]

31:12.474 --> 31:14.376
Shit.

31:14.411 --> 31:18.548
Here.

31:18.582 --> 31:21.281
[breathes shakily]

31:39.670 --> 31:41.806
Looks like fun.

31:41.839 --> 31:44.273
[sighs] If I wanted an
audience, I would have asked.

31:44.308 --> 31:47.759
I didn't come to watch.

31:50.815 --> 31:53.550
I'm gonna have to learn how to fight
cyclops-style sooner or later.

31:53.585 --> 31:55.195
I don't think you're
ready for that just yet.

31:55.219 --> 31:56.885
All I need is one kill shot.

31:56.921 --> 31:58.756
- Maybe you can teach me.
- [scoffs]

31:58.788 --> 32:02.858
- I don't teach kill shots.
- What do you teach, then?

32:02.893 --> 32:04.327
[sighs]

32:04.362 --> 32:09.362
- Defense.
- Defense is for pussies.

32:09.599 --> 32:11.601
Or survivors.

32:11.634 --> 32:13.737
Show me.

32:13.769 --> 32:17.007
[exhales]

32:17.040 --> 32:18.240
[grunts]

32:22.846 --> 32:23.895
[yells]

32:29.251 --> 32:31.189
I've revealed my special skill.

32:31.221 --> 32:33.471
[both grunting]

32:39.095 --> 32:41.931
Sword fighting?

32:41.965 --> 32:43.666
[Rose yells]

32:43.701 --> 32:45.868
Breaking things.

32:45.903 --> 32:48.337
I hope I haven't
broken this place.

32:48.372 --> 32:50.375
Seems like there's
a lot of drama around here.

32:50.407 --> 32:54.907
It has nothing to do with you.

33:04.255 --> 33:07.457
It was a hectic night...

33:07.490 --> 33:08.759
[panting]

33:08.791 --> 33:10.228
I didn't handle it so well.

33:10.260 --> 33:11.496
I've been there.

33:11.528 --> 33:14.029
Things get hectic in my life
and I fight.

33:14.064 --> 33:17.964
Happens to the best of us.

33:20.604 --> 33:21.703
Or the worst.

33:21.738 --> 33:26.509
[breathing heavily]

33:26.541 --> 33:28.246
Let's go again.

33:28.247 --> 33:32.247
There's been
enough fighting for tonight.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.268
Are you sure
this is the building?

33:50.300 --> 33:52.269
[Kory] I remember
where I parked my ship.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.939
[cell phone rings]

33:54.971 --> 33:58.074
You are very popular
on that thing.

33:58.108 --> 34:01.412
- I made friends.
- Mm-hmm. Man friends?

34:01.444 --> 34:03.948
[chuckles] Give me a minute.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.250
[cell phone continues ringing]

34:06.282 --> 34:07.818
- [cell phone beeps]
- Hey.

34:07.853 --> 34:10.387
- [Rachel] <i>Hey.
- [Kory] You're up late, kiddo.</i>

34:10.420 --> 34:12.422
[Rachel] <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

34:12.456 --> 34:14.056
<i>Did I catch you
at a bad time?</i>

34:14.090 --> 34:16.545
[Kory] I got a minute or two.
What's up?

34:18.295 --> 34:19.563
I was worried.

34:19.594 --> 34:20.898
About me?

34:20.929 --> 34:24.534
<i>That you went back home.</i>

34:24.568 --> 34:27.572
Rachel...

34:27.603 --> 34:29.340
'Cause everybody's
come back home,

34:29.373 --> 34:31.675
but the thing is,
nobody's staying.

34:31.710 --> 34:36.710
They're all moving on, and I
wondered if you're moving on too.

34:37.347 --> 34:40.083
I have to go home...

34:40.117 --> 34:41.518
too.

34:41.550 --> 34:43.186
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

34:43.219 --> 34:44.322
I get it.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.157
[shudders softly]

34:46.188 --> 34:49.925
I mean, you have
your own people back there,

34:49.960 --> 34:54.063
and I'm just
somebody you met.

34:54.097 --> 34:56.032
But I don't know.

34:56.067 --> 34:57.702
I don't know, I...
[inhales deeply]

34:57.735 --> 35:02.385
I felt like
you were my people.

35:03.273 --> 35:05.742
If you're going home,
maybe I could come with you.

35:05.777 --> 35:10.777
You don't belong
where I come from, Rachel.

35:10.947 --> 35:12.550
What's going on?

35:12.583 --> 35:14.483
Something's happening to me.

35:14.518 --> 35:16.487
Like before, with your father?

35:16.519 --> 35:18.956
No, this time, it's different.

35:18.987 --> 35:22.059
When I fought my father,

35:22.092 --> 35:25.695
I became something.

35:25.728 --> 35:28.898
Something different.

35:28.931 --> 35:32.235
And that different thing

35:32.269 --> 35:34.704
wants me to be it

35:34.737 --> 35:36.407
all the time.

35:36.440 --> 35:40.411
<i>So I spend all day
and all night</i>

35:40.443 --> 35:42.447
trying to hold it down,

35:42.478 --> 35:47.478
trying to hold it in,
trying to keep it in.

35:47.550 --> 35:50.253
[sobs]

35:50.286 --> 35:53.456
I'm so tired.

35:53.489 --> 35:56.159
What would happen
if you just let it out?

35:56.193 --> 35:58.094
<i>I don't know.</i>

35:58.128 --> 36:02.233
I think I would be like
when I...

36:02.264 --> 36:06.067
- When you killed your dad.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

36:06.068 --> 36:08.204
And I don't know if I

36:08.237 --> 36:12.742
want to be that all the time.

36:12.777 --> 36:17.726
I kind of just
want to be normal.

36:19.181 --> 36:20.349
Have you talked to Dick?

36:20.384 --> 36:23.353
No, I've caused enough trouble.

36:23.385 --> 36:26.621
That's why I'm telling you.

36:26.657 --> 36:29.125
It's okay.

36:29.126 --> 36:30.126
Sit tight.

36:30.127 --> 36:32.628
- What?
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>

36:32.661 --> 36:34.630
[exhales]

36:34.666 --> 36:38.402
I knew I could count on you.

36:38.434 --> 36:41.135
[cell phone beeps]

36:48.612 --> 36:51.762
- All good?
- All good.

36:54.217 --> 36:57.217
[electrical surging]

37:11.603 --> 37:14.403
I was beginning to think
we were stuck here.

37:14.438 --> 37:16.407
Where's your ship?

37:16.440 --> 37:18.275
I had a little trouble
with the touchdown.

37:18.309 --> 37:20.210
- Trouble.
- Mm-hmm.

37:20.242 --> 37:22.077
It's a good thing
your ship is operable.

37:22.112 --> 37:23.612
After you.

37:40.563 --> 37:44.469
- Don't...
- Sorry.

37:44.501 --> 37:45.803
What the hell?

37:45.804 --> 37:47.571
There's food in the galley.
Ten years' worth of it.

37:47.572 --> 37:49.306
I'll burn my way out of here.

37:49.340 --> 37:52.143
No a good idea.
It's our only ride home.

37:52.175 --> 37:53.978
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.846
This won't end with me.

37:55.880 --> 38:00.880
More will come for you,
legions of them.

38:01.318 --> 38:04.121
Let them come.

38:04.153 --> 38:07.304
[footsteps departing]

38:21.036 --> 38:22.806
How you doing?

38:22.840 --> 38:26.041
Nothing a bottle of Dewar's
can't fix.

38:28.699 --> 38:31.300
Or 20 Advil.

38:32.849 --> 38:36.949
- I'm sorry about tonight.
- Forget it.

38:36.954 --> 38:40.422
You saved a busload
full of people.

38:40.456 --> 38:42.956
I was just pissed
we missed our guy.

38:45.929 --> 38:48.699
I didn't mean to drag
you guys back in it.

38:48.733 --> 38:52.699
A part of me is glad
to be back here.

38:52.702 --> 38:55.505
Reminds me of why we started
doing this in the first place.

38:55.539 --> 38:58.340
[chuckles softly]
What was that again?

38:58.376 --> 39:00.077
Free booze.

39:00.108 --> 39:03.045
Yeah. Fully stocked fridge.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.947
The odd cult retreat.

39:04.983 --> 39:06.916
Bad jam bands
with two drummers.

39:06.951 --> 39:08.952
I fucking love
dueling drummer bands.

39:08.985 --> 39:12.054
[chuckles]

39:12.088 --> 39:14.425
Why'd you open it up again?

39:14.456 --> 39:15.893
After all the shit
that went down,

39:15.894 --> 39:19.396
I'd have thought you'd have
burned this place to the ground.

39:19.429 --> 39:22.532
Guess it feels like home.

39:22.567 --> 39:26.536
Only place that ever did.

39:26.570 --> 39:29.472
I'm sorry I can't
stay and help.

39:29.505 --> 39:30.806
It scares Dawn.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.077
I can't let her down again.

39:34.110 --> 39:37.547
Then you won't.

39:37.581 --> 39:40.215
Then I won't.

39:40.251 --> 39:41.550
[snaps fingers]

39:41.585 --> 39:44.487
Let's enjoy one last hurrah
at Arthur Light's expense.

39:44.521 --> 39:46.822
Take him down for good.

39:46.858 --> 39:50.492
He won't know what hit him.

39:50.527 --> 39:53.077
[system trilling]

39:58.233 --> 40:00.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:00.469 --> 40:01.804
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:01.840 --> 40:04.239
Yeah, I've been
knocked down before.

40:04.273 --> 40:08.112
Look, uh, Dick just reacted.

40:08.144 --> 40:11.246
- He didn't mean anything by it.
- Yeah, he did.

40:11.282 --> 40:12.782
Look, I know what I am.

40:12.817 --> 40:14.786
I'm a dirty
little favor to Bruce.

40:14.818 --> 40:17.786
And probably why
they reopened this place.

40:17.788 --> 40:20.123
A scrap heap for rejects.

40:20.157 --> 40:21.525
I'm not a reject.

40:21.559 --> 40:24.594
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you.

40:24.628 --> 40:26.396
Well, you're not
a reject either, Jason.

40:26.429 --> 40:29.728
We're... We're Titans.

40:31.601 --> 40:33.969
Hey, can I help you?

40:34.003 --> 40:36.672
Uh, sure.

40:36.706 --> 40:38.576
I'm just checking
for heat signatures.

40:38.608 --> 40:40.711
After Dr. Light
absorbed all that energy,

40:40.744 --> 40:42.411
he's gotta be radiation hot.

40:42.445 --> 40:44.882
What's that?

40:44.916 --> 40:47.818
[Gar] Emergency exits
on the Bayline Train Station.

40:47.851 --> 40:50.019
Underground,
so, impossible to read.

40:50.054 --> 40:52.755
Train tunnels must have
underground heat sensors,

40:52.789 --> 40:54.425
in case of a fire.

40:54.456 --> 40:56.693
Good idea.

40:56.728 --> 41:00.028
I'm just gonna piggyback
on the Bayline system.

41:00.063 --> 41:02.465
[beeping]

41:02.500 --> 41:04.202
Holy shit.

41:04.235 --> 41:07.469
[chuckles] You're amazing, Jason.
I think we got him.

41:07.505 --> 41:09.706
Whoa, where you going?

41:09.739 --> 41:11.842
- To tell Dick.
- I got a better idea.

41:11.876 --> 41:14.278
Look, why don't we go take
a quick look to make sure.

41:14.311 --> 41:17.614
'Cause if we're wrong,
we'll look like assholes.

41:17.648 --> 41:19.315
Yeah...

41:19.349 --> 41:21.985
- No.
- Gar, I need this.

41:22.019 --> 41:24.721
To make things right with Dick.
To show him what I can do.

41:24.755 --> 41:27.090
Yeah, what we can do.

41:27.125 --> 41:31.429
[sighs] Look, he knows
what you can do.

41:31.461 --> 41:34.163
You're Batman's guy.

41:34.197 --> 41:35.934
Was.

41:35.965 --> 41:38.468
I'm not saying we go rogue.

41:38.469 --> 41:39.902
We'll just do some
visual verification,

41:39.903 --> 41:42.405
lay eyes on the guy
and call Dick.

41:42.438 --> 41:44.742
Look, help me out, Gar.

41:44.775 --> 41:48.445
I could use a win.

41:48.478 --> 41:52.978
Quick look,
then we call Dick.

41:53.684 --> 41:55.184
I promise.

41:59.123 --> 42:03.492
[Gar] I thought this was
reconnaissance only.

42:03.527 --> 42:06.094
You're overdressed.

42:06.130 --> 42:08.599
[chuckles] Exactly.

42:08.632 --> 42:12.101
Reconnaissance on
a homicidal psychopath.

42:12.135 --> 42:13.804
Safety first.

42:13.836 --> 42:15.871
- [exhales]
- I'm calling Dick.

42:15.907 --> 42:19.208
Come on, man. Okay, you
agreed to help me out.

42:19.242 --> 42:21.943
Please?

42:21.978 --> 42:24.380
Let's go.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.364
[Jason sighs]

42:29.487 --> 42:31.521
All right.

42:31.554 --> 42:33.989
Let's, uh... Let's split up.

42:34.023 --> 42:36.760
Huh?

42:36.793 --> 42:38.496
[chuckles] Dude.

42:38.528 --> 42:41.231
No, no, no. Have you never
seen a horror movie before?

42:41.264 --> 42:44.835
You wanna get out
of here fast, right?

42:44.867 --> 42:48.467
The two of us will get the
job done in half the time.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.576
Okay.

42:52.608 --> 42:56.211
Dark, creepy tunnel it is.

42:56.246 --> 42:59.996
[soft electrical humming]

43:11.996 --> 43:13.965
What, the big kids
weren't available,

43:13.996 --> 43:15.431
they sent Junior Robin?

43:15.465 --> 43:17.768
[light switch clangs]

43:17.800 --> 43:19.969
Maybe you're just a fanboy.

43:20.003 --> 43:21.438
[flashlight clatters]

43:21.471 --> 43:25.340
[grunting]

43:25.376 --> 43:27.025
[chuckling]

43:34.349 --> 43:35.349
Fuck!

43:42.393 --> 43:43.626
[Dr. Light chuckles]

43:43.661 --> 43:47.797
[Jason panting]

43:47.831 --> 43:52.469
[Dick] <i>In a battle,
anything can be taken from you.</i>

43:52.503 --> 43:57.273
<i>No matter what is taken, you must
be able to keep fighting, and win.</i>

43:57.306 --> 43:58.806
[grunting]

44:04.280 --> 44:05.315
Hey, lightbulb.

44:05.349 --> 44:07.751
Fuck off.

44:07.784 --> 44:09.519
Is it Lite,
like Lite beer Lite?

44:09.552 --> 44:11.255
Shut the fuck up!

44:11.286 --> 44:12.586
Fuck you!

44:15.391 --> 44:18.391
[Dr. Light grunting]

44:20.496 --> 44:21.898
[both grunting]

44:21.931 --> 44:24.800
- [bones crack]
- [Dr. Light yells]

44:24.835 --> 44:28.871
- [bones crack]
- [Dr. Light groans]

44:28.905 --> 44:31.755
[Dr. Light panting]

44:36.514 --> 44:39.514
[Dr. Light groaning]

44:46.922 --> 44:49.460
This Titan is back, bitch.

44:49.492 --> 44:53.197
[groaning]

44:53.230 --> 44:58.230
- [laughing]
- [footsteps approaching]

45:12.514 --> 45:14.318
[muffled scream]

45:14.349 --> 45:16.152
Oh, man.

45:16.184 --> 45:17.184
