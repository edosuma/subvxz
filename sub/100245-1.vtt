00:42.918 --> 00:45.208

00:45.296 --> 00:46.296
MAN:
How bad is the tear?!

00:46.380 --> 00:49.050
-(Amelia panting)

00:50.968 --> 00:52.548
MAN:
We need to lose more weight!

00:52.636 --> 00:54.556
(Amelia panting faster)

00:54.638 --> 00:57.138
(wind howling)

00:57.224 --> 00:59.394

01:04.482 --> 01:06.232
ANTONIA:
Amelia?

01:13.324 --> 01:16.244
Are you quite well?

01:16.327 --> 01:18.037
You don’t need
to fly today.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.620
You can return
to Richmond with me.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.285
Antonia,
I just need a moment.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.923
After all you’ve been through,
no one will think worse of you.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.631
I would.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.511
I would think worse of me.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.379
I have an agreement
with Mr. Glaisher.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.007
You barely know the man,

01:33.093 --> 01:34.893
and the little you do,
you’re irritated by.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.770
Antonia, please, I...

01:37.848 --> 01:39.768
just need a moment.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.936
One last piece
of sisterly advice.

01:45.523 --> 01:48.283
Doubt is there
to be listened to.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.827
(footsteps running)

02:00.913 --> 02:02.623

MAN:
Come and get your tickets!

02:21.141 --> 02:24.651
MAN: Amelia Wren!
How high will she go?!

02:24.728 --> 02:27.358
WOMAN: And afterwards, I’ve got
to take you straight to...

02:27.439 --> 02:29.899
(chatter continues)

02:29.984 --> 02:31.904
MAN:
Amelia Wren!

02:31.986 --> 02:33.946
WOMAN:
Well, I read all about it...

03:48.562 --> 03:51.822
-(steady ticking)
-JAMES: She’s late.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.689
She is, but that’s
the least of your concerns.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.186
JAMES:
We’ll lose the light, John.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.067
JOHN: James, do the clouds
not look ominous to you?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.534
JAMES: I repeatedly explained
to Miss Wren

03:58.614 --> 04:00.074
the importance
of catching the right light

04:00.157 --> 04:01.697
and the right wind
at the right time,

04:01.784 --> 04:05.294
-and she’s just
openly ignored me.
-James, look up.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.961
It’s not a concern, John.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.539
The readings I took
this morning were quite clear.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.214
Far be it from me
to doubt you, James,

04:10.292 --> 04:12.092
but your weather predictions
have been wrong in the past,

04:12.169 --> 04:13.419
and it’s just possible
that you’ve missed...

04:13.504 --> 04:14.634
NED:
Don’t even think of it.

04:14.713 --> 04:15.553
Ah.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.630
JAMES:
Ned Chambers,

04:17.716 --> 04:19.125
John Trew,
my very good friend.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.598
John, this is Ned,
one of the hardy entrepreneurs

04:21.678 --> 04:23.219
who’s invested
in our expedition.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.515
Do not even think of telling me
flight is not possible.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.349
Mr. Chambers, we are scientists
of the air, and we can tell you

04:28.435 --> 04:31.765
the one thing no one
can control is, well, the air.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.565
NED: I have paid for gas.
I have paid for silk.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.280
And is this balloon
not the strongest

04:36.360 --> 04:37.570
and largest that’s ever been?

04:37.653 --> 04:39.533
Even so,
it can’t fight the weather.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.623
You don’t want to be
responsible for a tragedy, sir.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.949
I don’t wish to be responsible
for refunding the 10,000

04:44.034 --> 04:45.874
that came here because
you promised them history.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.913
We’ll fly, Ned. We’ll fly.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.037
I only need the sky
to hold for 90 minutes,

04:50.124 --> 04:53.094
and once we’re above
the cloud line, we’ll be fine.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.498
Good. That’s fixed, then.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.666
Now, did you not promise me
a 5:00 ascent?

04:58.757 --> 04:59.877
I’m set.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.837
I’m merely waiting
for our pilot.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.967
And it’s not the first time
Miss Wren has kept me waiting.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.925
(chuckles)

05:12.688 --> 05:15.478
JOHN:
What a truly pleasant man.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.816
One must make compromises
in order to achieve greatness,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.451
-my friend.
-(crowd cheering)

05:22.031 --> 05:24.281
-And he...
-(horse neighing)

05:24.366 --> 05:26.446
is merely one compromise.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.605
You’re incredibly late.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.116
Lesson number one
of aeronauting:

06:05.199 --> 06:07.369
We are creatures of the skies

06:07.451 --> 06:09.871
and have no respect
for landlocked clocks.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.373
(loudly): Mr. Glaisher, are you
really not a gentleman at all?

06:13.457 --> 06:16.747
-(crowd laughs)
-Hold out your hand to me.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.205
(crowd murmuring)

06:19.296 --> 06:21.126
-Go on, Glaisher!
-Go on! -Take her hand!

06:21.215 --> 06:23.125
WOMAN: Look like you’ve never
seen a woman before!

06:23.217 --> 06:24.927
-Don’t keep a lady waiting!
-Come on, Mr. Glaisher!

06:25.010 --> 06:26.180

Take her hand!

You’re naughty!
(chuckles)

06:36.522 --> 06:38.192
Are you ready?

06:38.273 --> 06:41.283
Mr. Glaisher, you have no
conception of how ready I am.

JAMES:
No, no, no.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.384
No, absolutely not.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.092
Under no circumstances
are we taking a dog.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.222
I told you we’d have to play
to the crowd,

07:04.299 --> 07:06.219
and they prefer my dog
to your boxes.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.851
Those are essential
meteorological instruments.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.308
-And this is an essential dog.
-(barks)

Go on. In you go.

Ladies and gentlemen,

07:28.198 --> 07:31.028
today, myself-- Amelia Wren--

07:31.118 --> 07:33.948
my naughty scientist,
Mr. Glaisher...

07:34.037 --> 07:37.457
-(laughter)
-and my wonder dog Posey

07:37.541 --> 07:40.381
are going to change the world.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.840
Are you ready for us to do so?

07:42.921 --> 07:44.801
(crowd cheering)

07:44.882 --> 07:49.432
This balloon on which I stand--

07:49.511 --> 07:53.931
the Mammoth--
is a balloon like no other,

07:54.016 --> 07:58.976
and will allow us to ascend
higher into the air

07:59.062 --> 08:03.482
than any man or woman
has ever gone.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.987

08:11.408 --> 08:15.538
The French rose to 23,000 feet.

08:15.621 --> 08:19.121
Today, we will
break that record

08:19.208 --> 08:23.168
and reclaim it
for these fair shores!

08:23.253 --> 08:25.093
(crowd cheering)

08:25.172 --> 08:27.302
Who knows?

08:27.382 --> 08:30.762
We may reach the Moon

08:30.844 --> 08:33.563
and bring back...

08:33.639 --> 08:36.099
-stardust!
-(crowd cheering)

08:36.183 --> 08:40.903
Today is a day
when history will be made,

08:40.979 --> 08:43.729

a part of it.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.985

08:48.362 --> 08:50.782
Mr. Glaisher,
now is your moment.

Up you get.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.212

09:06.129 --> 09:07.549
Fireworks?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.551
Are you ready?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.893
Yes. I just need to retake
my ground readings

09:11.969 --> 09:14.849
and then do one final check
of the equipment.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.600
Well, my equipment

09:16.682 --> 09:18.932
-was all prepared in advance.
-(air hisses)

09:19.017 --> 09:20.267
Now, don’t touch this rope,
Mr. Glaisher,

09:20.352 --> 09:21.602
’cause it will let out the gas.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.897
I do know how a balloon works.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.863
Uh, what are you doing?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.032
AMELIA:
We fly.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.900
-The sky awaits.
-Wait, no.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.657
These ground readings
are essential.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.318

If they’re not accurate...

09:33.407 --> 09:35.657

(Posey barking)

09:57.389 --> 09:59.599
-What are you doing?
-Giving the people
their money’s worth.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.773
W-Will that not damage
the integrity of the balloon?

10:01.852 --> 10:02.772
Perhaps.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.313
Goodbye!

10:04.396 --> 10:06.316
JAMES:
For God’s sake.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.398
AMELIA:
Goodbye!

10:09.359 --> 10:11.279
This is absurd.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.861
It’s what they call
entertainment, Mr. Glaisher.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.067
Well, I’m not finding it
particularly entertaining.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.117
It requires a...
a sense of humor,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.660
which you seem to lack.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.624

Don’t be so sour.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.964
Give me the dog.

What do you mean,
give you the dog?

10:30.756 --> 10:33.176
-Pass me Posey, Mr. Glaisher.
-I’m not giving you the dog.

Mr. Glaisher, the dog. Now.

Mr. Glaisher, you are airborne

11:18.678 --> 11:20.888

I suggest you spend less time
frowning at me and...

Insignificant?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.031
Do you take anything seriously,
Miss Wren?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.362
Some things.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.157
That crowd gathered to witness
us break the height record.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.701
They didn’t need to see
a flying dog.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.995
Mm. Still stuck there, are you?
(chuckles)

13:08.079 --> 13:09.619
I’ve spent much of my life

13:09.706 --> 13:11.456
being laughed at
for what I do, Miss Wren.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.041
I’d rather hope that today
might prove an exception.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.087
Tell me, what determines
your reputation?

13:16.171 --> 13:17.551
My reputation?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.931
Yes, your standing
in the scientific community.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.138
The papers I’ve written,
the discoveries I’ve uncovered.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.889
Your reputation
is built on paper,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.390
and my reputation
is built on screams.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.983
And those people below,
they came to be entertained.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.519
And they, if you didn’t know,

13:30.602 --> 13:33.482
are the ones paying
for this trip.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.653
You off to the opera?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.822
(objects clanking softly)

13:38.902 --> 13:41.532
I’ve been looking
at the same thing.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.163
Don’t tell me that cloud
isn’t a cause for concern.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.741
I’m the scientist;
you’re the pilot.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.155
Let’s stick to our roles,
shall we?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.921
(bell tolling in distance)

14:10.058 --> 14:11.518
JOHN:
James!

14:11.601 --> 14:13.481
-James!
-Come on, John.
-(bell tolling)

14:13.562 --> 14:14.902
-I’ll not miss the takeoff.
-It’s in the air.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.690
We could have stayed
on the ground and looked up.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.194
We must see it from
the best vantage point, Johnny.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.317
-JOHN: For God’s sake.
-(horse neighing)

14:25.782 --> 14:28.412
(John panting)

14:28.493 --> 14:30.663
JAMES: Sky’s clear,
so I predict a clean takeoff,

14:30.745 --> 14:34.365
which means that in precisely
24 seconds we should see it.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.417
JOHN:
(exhales) You are aware

14:36.501 --> 14:38.171
he might not make it
off the ground?

14:38.253 --> 14:40.383
JAMES: Charles Green
will make it off the ground.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.093
JOHN: Maybe not quite so close
to the edge of the building.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.724
Listen, John,
will you stop scowling at me?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.641
-Sc...
-Do I count the hours
that I spend

14:46.720 --> 14:48.350
helping you
pin butterflies to a board?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.770
(chuckles) Pinning butterflies
is not a dangerous pursuit.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.020
-(watch ticking)
-Five, four,

14:55.103 --> 14:57.653
three, two,

14:57.731 --> 14:59.731
-one.
-(ticking stops)

14:59.816 --> 15:01.936
-(birds chirping)
-(seagulls calling in distance)

15:07.907 --> 15:09.827
JOHN:
Could be anything.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.949
The gas valve ruptured.
The silk tore.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.631
(bird screeching)

15:19.711 --> 15:21.631
(chuckles)

15:21.713 --> 15:24.763
He’s rethought
the balloon shape.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.891
It’s wider at the top,
like a parachute.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.638
That’s very clever.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.180
JOHN:
May I look?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.393
Yes, you may. Here.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.274
(dog barking in distance)

15:40.857 --> 15:42.477
John.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.487
If you’ve had time enough...

15:56.790 --> 15:59.000
You’ll get your chance,
you know.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.594
They’ll realize your worth.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.759
I think they know my worth
quite well enough.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.643
-(men clamoring)
-JAMES: Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

16:08.718 --> 16:11.598
We-we know more now
about this world around us

16:11.680 --> 16:13.430
than at any moment
in our history.

16:13.515 --> 16:16.135
And yet, still, still,
we are limited

16:16.226 --> 16:19.396
by our ignorance
as to what is truly above us.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.109
Now, with the progress that
we have made in balloon ascent

16:22.190 --> 16:24.610
here at the Society,
pioneered by Charles Green,

16:24.693 --> 16:27.403
we could advance meteorology
by decades.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.357
Analysis of
the Earth’s magnetic field,

16:29.447 --> 16:31.947
the solar spectrum,
knowledge of the dew point,

16:32.033 --> 16:34.243
understanding of oxygenation
of the atmosphere,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.367
-atmospheric...
-He wants my balloon!

16:36.454 --> 16:38.874
-(laughter)
-No, sir.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.087
No, sir, I ask for funding
for my own expedition

16:42.168 --> 16:44.088
-into the skies.
-(others murmuring, gasping)

16:44.170 --> 16:45.760
By gathering enough data,

16:45.839 --> 16:48.679
I believe that we will be able
to uncover patterns

16:48.758 --> 16:50.388
-and correlations that...
-Sir,

16:50.468 --> 16:52.678
we are scientists,
not fortune tellers.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.852
You’re talking about
weather prediction.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.101
But is that not our
responsibility as scientists,

16:57.183 --> 16:59.193
to find order in chaos,
gentlemen?

16:59.269 --> 17:00.899
Please, if we could understand
the sky above us...

17:00.979 --> 17:02.769
You are no closer to predicting
the movements of the weather

17:02.856 --> 17:05.066
-than the movements
of a frog in a jar.
-(laughter)

17:05.150 --> 17:06.690
JAMES:
If we could understand the skies

17:06.776 --> 17:08.736
-above us, gentlemen...
-(clapping, lively chatter)

17:08.819 --> 17:10.160
Gentlemen, we...

17:10.238 --> 17:11.948
-You’re delusional, my friend.
-With your financial support,

17:12.031 --> 17:15.580
we are on the precipice
of extraordinary change.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.500
The possibility of advanced
weather prediction could--

17:18.579 --> 17:20.170
-it could save lives.
-(chatter continues)

17:20.248 --> 17:22.788
Gentlemen. Gent...
Gentlemen, please!

17:22.876 --> 17:25.126
MAN:
We have to sit through this?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.090
Please!

17:37.223 --> 17:39.643
ARTHUR:
"James Glaisher spoke again

17:39.726 --> 17:42.346
"this week at the Royal Society

17:42.437 --> 17:46.147
of his plans to make a science
of the weather."

17:46.232 --> 17:47.652
In-in The Times.
You read it?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.074
JAMES:
Yes, I’ve read it, Pa.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.782
"To the accompaniment
of much laughter."

17:51.863 --> 17:54.323
-Oh, Arthur, please stop.
-They’re wrong, by the way.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.657
Well, many more thought
you were.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.663
Well, many didn’t believe
in Newton.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.495
Newton? Oh, James.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.291
Newton changed the way
we see the Earth

18:04.375 --> 18:07.335
and the planets and the stars.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.130
You think you can predict...

18:10.215 --> 18:12.125
when it might rain.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.967
(clocks and watches ticking)

18:14.052 --> 18:18.812
Th-These things that people
are saying about you, James,

18:18.890 --> 18:20.810
don’t-don’t... don’t they hurt?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.232
I wish it didn’t hurt you.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.936
-(lively chatter)
-(bell dinging)

18:32.237 --> 18:34.487
(horse neighing)

18:41.120 --> 18:42.790
JAMES:
Time:

18:42.872 --> 18:46.712
-nine minutes and 23 seconds.
-(steady ticking)

18:46.793 --> 18:51.343
Altitude is 5,400 feet.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.882
And air temperature is
64 degrees Fahrenheit.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.598
AMELIA:
Delightful. Could you...?

18:59.931 --> 19:02.481
-What?
-Just-just at the top.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.232
Yeah.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.119
You should put on
your oilskins, Mr. Glaisher.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.963
(objects clinking softly)

19:37.677 --> 19:39.177
-(pigeon cooing)
-JAMES: All right.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.762
Out you come.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.888
AMELIA: What are you attaching
to those pigeons?

19:43.975 --> 19:46.055
JAMES:
Our readings.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.524
Oh. I see.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.686
Reassuring to know
you’ve contemplated our deaths.

19:51.774 --> 19:56.074
I’ve just insured against them,
should we not make it back.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.082
(wind whooshing softly)

20:10.001 --> 20:12.091
AMELIA:
Cloud ahoy.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.432
(chuckles softly)

20:24.349 --> 20:26.269
(chuckles)

20:28.436 --> 20:30.356
(laughs)

20:31.856 --> 20:35.316
"What more felicitie
can fall to creature

20:35.401 --> 20:37.201
"Than to enjoy delight...

20:37.278 --> 20:39.108
-with libertie..."
-PIERRE: "With libertie,

20:39.197 --> 20:43.027
And to be lord
of all the workes of Nature."

20:43.117 --> 20:46.497
BOTH: "To raine
in th’ aire from earth..."

20:46.579 --> 20:48.329
PIERRE:
"...to the highest skie,

20:48.414 --> 20:52.884
To feed on flowres and weeds
of glorious feature."

20:52.961 --> 20:55.211
JAMES and PIERRE:
"To take what ever thing

20:55.296 --> 20:57.506
doth please the eie?"

20:59.842 --> 21:01.302
Spenser.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.926
"The Fate of the Butterflie."

21:03.012 --> 21:05.722
It’s one of my favorite poems.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.516
Surprising.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.944
I didn’t have you down
as a literary man.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.993
Men of science, uh,
can enjoy words, Miss Wren.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.279
My husband loved that poem.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.066
I would have liked
to have met your husband.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.292
I’m not sure
he’d have liked you.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.999
(chuckles):
Really?

21:28.079 --> 21:31.419
He disliked people who studied
rather than practiced.

21:31.499 --> 21:35.169
(thunder rumbling in distance)

21:35.253 --> 21:37.763
Are we still sure
this weather will hold?

21:37.839 --> 21:40.509
Because my instinct
is telling me...

21:40.591 --> 21:43.341
Instinct has no place
in weather prediction.

21:43.428 --> 21:44.848
You’re lying to me.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.389
Every reading that I took
this morning

21:46.472 --> 21:47.892
was quite clear, Miss Wren.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.644
There are no advantages
in concealing concerns.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.936
We are trapped here
no matter what you say.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.820
This pressure is changing
faster than I’d anticipated.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.648
(wind whistling)

21:58.818 --> 22:00.358
We’re about to get wet.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.032
(watch ticking)

22:05.116 --> 22:06.116
(thunder crashes)

22:06.200 --> 22:08.580
(muttering quietly)

22:08.661 --> 22:10.121
(wind whistling)

22:10.204 --> 22:11.834
(basket rattling, creaking)

22:11.914 --> 22:14.464
(gasps, chuckles softly)

22:15.835 --> 22:17.665
And so it begins.

22:22.633 --> 22:25.603
(thunder rumbling)

22:25.678 --> 22:29.058
I’m not sure your instruments
are much use to us now.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.850
We need to batten down,

22:30.933 --> 22:33.943
so please put on
your wet weather clothing.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.324
There are no prizes
for obstinacy.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.820
-James.
-(thunder crashes)

22:40.902 --> 22:43.572
If you won’t listen to me,
listen to that.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.074
But not one of my readings
suggested a storm.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.197
Well, that’s what it is,
and we’re inside a cumulo,

22:49.285 --> 22:52.115
which is precisely
where we shouldn’t be.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.365
Don’t worry.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.826
She’s not made
of conductive material,

22:54.916 --> 22:56.786
so we won’t attract lightning.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.586
And if we are struck,

22:58.669 --> 23:00.839
the gas will explode,
so we won’t live long enough

23:00.922 --> 23:02.472
for me to point out...
(screams)

23:02.548 --> 23:05.428
(wind howling)

23:05.510 --> 23:06.760
Hold on!

23:06.844 --> 23:09.144
(both yell)

23:12.975 --> 23:14.345
Get that equipment
put away now!

23:14.435 --> 23:15.935
These instruments
will give us... (grunts)

23:16.020 --> 23:18.020
(basket rattling, creaking)

23:18.106 --> 23:19.816
(grunts)

23:19.899 --> 23:21.189
Stay still and keep calm.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.935
I need to get us out of this.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.947
(yelps, grunts)

23:28.741 --> 23:31.451
-(thunder crashes)
-(grunting): No! No!

23:31.536 --> 23:33.076
We cannot descend!

23:33.162 --> 23:35.162
This might be our one
and only opportunity.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.038
-Of course we don’t descend.
-We don’t?

23:37.125 --> 23:38.915
There are two ways
to break a storm.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.591
One is to travel beneath it,
the other above it.

23:42.672 --> 23:46.012
The safest way is up.
(grunts)

23:47.301 --> 23:48.891
The safest way is up?

23:48.970 --> 23:51.680
Who did you think
you got in a balloon with?

23:51.764 --> 23:53.354
(both screaming)

23:55.726 --> 23:57.646
(shouting)

23:58.729 --> 24:00.149
(both scream)

24:00.231 --> 24:02.231
(thunder crashing)

24:05.027 --> 24:07.197
(yelling, grunting)

24:11.284 --> 24:13.494
(gasps) Amelia!

24:13.578 --> 24:17.538
-Amelia! Amelia!
-(Amelia screaming)

24:17.623 --> 24:19.583
-Give me your hand!
-(yells)

24:20.751 --> 24:22.301
-(rope snapping)
-(both yell)

24:22.378 --> 24:23.498
(grunts)

24:23.588 --> 24:24.958
(thunder booming)

24:25.047 --> 24:26.417
Hold on!

24:26.507 --> 24:28.127
(yells)

24:31.179 --> 24:33.059
Hold on!

24:33.139 --> 24:35.219
(Amelia yells)

24:37.059 --> 24:39.149
Take my hand! Take my hand!

24:39.228 --> 24:41.268
One!

24:41.355 --> 24:42.685
Two!

24:42.773 --> 24:44.193
Three!

24:44.275 --> 24:45.985
(both grunting)

24:55.870 --> 24:57.790
(both yell)

25:01.584 --> 25:04.214
-(Amelia gasping)
-(thunder crashing)

25:09.675 --> 25:12.385
-You all right?
-Yes.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.806
(gasping, grunting)

25:22.730 --> 25:25.190
(wind howling)

25:40.873 --> 25:42.543
Hold on!

25:42.625 --> 25:44.165
It’s not over yet.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.679
(both screaming)

25:53.261 --> 25:55.931
(metallic rattling)

26:00.226 --> 26:02.556
(gasping)

26:02.645 --> 26:04.145
(storm quiets)

26:04.230 --> 26:06.400
(ropes creaking gently)

26:15.116 --> 26:18.156
(both panting)

26:33.634 --> 26:36.644
(grunting quietly)

26:36.721 --> 26:38.391
(Amelia grunts)

26:39.307 --> 26:41.427
(panting)

26:44.770 --> 26:46.440
(James chuckles)

27:10.212 --> 27:12.212
(panting)

27:12.298 --> 27:13.838
A lucky escape.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.844
Or a brilliant one.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.937
-(crowd chattering)
-(children squealing playfully)

27:28.272 --> 27:30.362
(bell clanging in distance)

27:32.109 --> 27:34.279
(crowd chatter continues)

27:38.240 --> 27:40.240
May I look through
your spyglass, sir?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.576
There’s nothing to see.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.250
I lost them
when the storm passed over.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.369
I would like a look
all the same, sir.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.616
I won’t steal it.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.287
I didn’t presume you would.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.960
You have an interest
in the air?

27:53.047 --> 27:54.967
Don’t you wish
to be up there with them?

27:55.049 --> 27:57.509
No, I’d be
an unnecessary weight.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.893
All the same.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.806
Some reach for the stars.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.272
Some push others towards them.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.193
-(bell dings)
-(crowd cheers in distance)

28:09.271 --> 28:10.731
I wish I was up there.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.645
You’re not afraid
of the clouds?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.954
Clouds are just water.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.318
Oh.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.565
And what of the birds
that may attack you?

28:21.659 --> 28:23.829
May I look through
your spyglass?

28:23.911 --> 28:25.451
(chuckles softly)

28:32.128 --> 28:33.798
-(bell dings)
-(crowd cheers in distance)

28:33.879 --> 28:35.459
I can see them, sir.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.838
Not possible.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.594
I-I can see them, sir. I can.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.601
(laughs)

28:46.725 --> 28:48.765
(steady ticking)

28:56.902 --> 28:58.652
(James grunting)

28:58.737 --> 29:00.947
JAMES:
That’s my entire body weight.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.249
-(Amelia grunting)
-You all right?

29:10.749 --> 29:11.919
There we go.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.631
Now, that should hold.

29:13.711 --> 29:14.961
I hope.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.705
Looks pretty precarious to me.

29:16.797 --> 29:19.217
She’s stronger
than she looks.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.930
Right.

29:21.010 --> 29:23.510
(box thumps, slides)

29:23.596 --> 29:26.016
James.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.348
James, you’ll miss it.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.281
JAMES:
That’s an aureole.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.072
Have you seen
one of those before?

29:40.154 --> 29:41.534
AMELIA:
You haven’t?

29:41.614 --> 29:43.744
JAMES:
I have in books.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.125
I believe you should be
checking your instruments.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.763
You can’t have taken a good
reading in quite some time.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.880
(chuckles softly)

30:01.967 --> 30:05.217
You so enjoy being amused
by me, don’t you?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.224
I’m amused by your enjoyment

30:07.306 --> 30:10.936
of something that has
nothing to do with numbers.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.453
Have you noticed
it’s completely silent?

30:41.423 --> 30:46.933
Hello...!

30:47.930 --> 30:49.770
(chuckles)

30:51.642 --> 30:53.062
(inhales sharply)

30:53.143 --> 30:54.853
(yelling)

30:54.937 --> 30:56.607
(chuckles)

31:00.025 --> 31:02.735
(yelling)

31:02.820 --> 31:04.450
(Amelia chuckles)

31:04.530 --> 31:07.240
(both yelling)

31:13.038 --> 31:15.578
(James yelling in distance)

31:18.544 --> 31:21.014
(Amelia yelling)

31:27.303 --> 31:30.473
Cloud ahoy...!

31:35.394 --> 31:37.354
(bells tolling in distance)

31:37.438 --> 31:39.768
Can you hear that?

31:39.857 --> 31:41.277
It’s a bell.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.318
-(bells continue tolling)
-(crowd chattering in distance)

31:43.402 --> 31:46.452
-That’s bells.
-(chuckles)

31:46.530 --> 31:48.700
-Where is that coming from?
-(horse neighing)

31:48.782 --> 31:51.582
-(hoofbeats clopping)
-That’s horses.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.660
So the humid conditions
must be conducting the sound.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.406
-We have...
-That’s the sound of the street.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.577
...flown through a storm,
and still London follows us.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.206
This high barometer reading’s
phenomenal.

31:59.293 --> 32:02.423
PIERRE (echoing):
Amelia. Regarde-moi.

32:02.504 --> 32:03.764
(grunting)

32:03.839 --> 32:04.879
PIERRE:
Amelia. Amelia!

32:04.965 --> 32:06.965
(Pierre’s voice overlapping,
speaking French)

32:07.051 --> 32:08.091
Amelia, regarde-moi!

32:08.177 --> 32:09.637
Amelia!

32:09.720 --> 32:12.060
-(thud)
-Amelia, this...

32:12.139 --> 32:13.599
Amelia, what’s the matter?

32:13.682 --> 32:15.732
Are you all right?

32:17.770 --> 32:19.690
It’ll soon pass.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.822
(wind whistling)

32:23.108 --> 32:25.528
(knocking)

32:25.611 --> 32:28.661
(Posey whining)

32:30.449 --> 32:33.039
(knocking)

32:34.620 --> 32:36.500
(grunts)

32:36.580 --> 32:37.790
(door opens)

32:39.833 --> 32:41.253
I didn’t lock it.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.205
No, you did not.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.165
-(door closes)
-You’re not dressed.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.625
Yet I’m wearing clothes.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.835
And when was the last time
you changed them?

32:48.926 --> 32:52.256
So you break down my door
to tell me to wash?

32:52.346 --> 32:54.516
When was the last time
you opened any curtains?

32:54.598 --> 32:55.848
Sunlight ages.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.233
I want my furnishings
to retain their glow.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.520
Which ones are glowing?

32:59.603 --> 33:01.403
The ones, uh,
with your food upon them

33:01.480 --> 33:03.650
or the ones that are covered
in your-your dirty clothing?

33:03.732 --> 33:07.282
I do not need to see it
to know it’s there.

33:07.361 --> 33:11.071
Well, as much as you might
enjoy your self-pity,

33:11.156 --> 33:13.026
I’m not here
to freshen anything.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.407
Phillip has invited us

33:14.493 --> 33:17.873
-to a small gathering.
-Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.035
-(sniffs)
-(Amelia grunts)

33:20.124 --> 33:21.714
Amelia.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.592
(sighs) I do so hate
how you say my name.

33:24.670 --> 33:28.090
It’s like a priest imploring
me to confess my sins.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.888
It’s been two years.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.929
Do you really think Pierre
would have wanted this?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.602
(sets bottle down)

33:37.307 --> 33:39.727
That is beneath even you.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.950
I’ll help you change.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.910
Come.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.036
Sisters together.

34:02.124 --> 34:03.754
And then I’ll let you rot.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.592
Mm-hmm.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.802
(classical music playing)

34:13.217 --> 34:15.507
-(laughter, quiet chatter)
-(classical music continues)

34:15.596 --> 34:17.466
WOMAN:
So much easier to claim so

34:17.556 --> 34:19.056
with handsome men on one’s arm.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.771
-Yes, uh, certainly. Yes.
-(laughs)

34:20.851 --> 34:22.021
Oh, please.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.232
Mother always taught me,

34:23.312 --> 34:25.482
why have one man
when you can have two?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.694
-Please.
-Oh. Be a pleasure to.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.985
-Will you excuse me?
-Bonny.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.697
Come on, then.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.859
(chatter continues)

34:36.784 --> 34:39.623
Your sister’s proud as punch
she’s pulled you here.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.163
Hello, Auntie.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.826
She keeps trying to persuade
men to take you onto the floor.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.206
AMELIA:
And they refuse her?

34:45.292 --> 34:46.922
FRANCES: I think
they’re intimidated by you.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.502
AMELIA:
How exciting.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.717
Still, hard to be
the woman that provokes fear.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.556
Are you the Widow Wren?

35:00.641 --> 35:02.941
I dislike that title.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.898
But you are Miss Wren?

35:04.978 --> 35:06.808
Amelia Wren.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.477
And who might you be?

35:08.565 --> 35:11.235
Glaisher. James Glaisher.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.738
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Glaisher.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.951
Wh-What brings you here?

35:17.032 --> 35:19.242
-Here?
-Yeah.

35:19.326 --> 35:23.036
The, uh... the selfish needs
of a sister.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.211
You?

35:24.289 --> 35:27.289
The mercenary needs
of a friend.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.626
Uh, he needed accompanying
in his romance.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.841
She’s apparently worth
thousands of pounds a year,

35:31.922 --> 35:34.222
so I’m trapped here,
just as you are.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.679
Well, we needn’t
trap each other.

35:35.759 --> 35:38.429
Miss Wren, sorry,
I’m a, I’m a sc-scientist,

35:38.512 --> 35:40.892
an astronomer
and a meteorologist, and I...

35:40.973 --> 35:43.353
A scientist, an astronomer
and a what?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.143
I believe that the weather
can be predicted.

35:45.227 --> 35:46.517
(woman laughing)

35:46.603 --> 35:50.403
Miss Wren, I need to make
studies of the air,

35:50.482 --> 35:52.692
and I need to be in the air.

35:52.776 --> 35:56.276
And I need you to help me.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.493
Do you even have a balloon?

35:59.700 --> 36:00.910
Not yet, no.

36:00.993 --> 36:03.623
-I don’t.
-So you make
an invitation to me,

36:03.704 --> 36:06.544
when it is I
who should be inviting you?

36:06.623 --> 36:11.173
No, I need us...
I need you to fly us higher

36:11.253 --> 36:15.013
than any man or any woman
has ever been. What?

36:15.090 --> 36:16.430
(Antonia speaking indistinctly)

36:18.176 --> 36:19.796
Dance with me.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.217
Dance with you?

36:21.305 --> 36:24.305
Dance with me,
and we may converse more.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.104
Amelia. Um... Oh.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.566
(waltz music playing)

36:36.194 --> 36:38.204
I presume there’s a game
you’re playing here

36:38.280 --> 36:39.620
with others in the room.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.278
You think I’m trying
to make another jealous?

36:42.367 --> 36:45.157
You’re not that handsome.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.455
Every man in this room
is petrified

36:47.539 --> 36:50.539
to be seen talking to you,
let alone dancing with you.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.956
No, I imagine
your game is with another.

36:53.045 --> 36:56.045
-You’re clever.
-I’m observant.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.421
Or presumptuous.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.217
And there are certain things,
if I may,

37:00.302 --> 37:02.802
that I feel safe
in presuming about you.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.138
Perhaps that you don’t have

37:04.222 --> 37:06.102
an invitation
for tonight’s events.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.273
Would that be
a fair presumption?

37:08.352 --> 37:10.852
On what basis
do you make that assumption?

37:10.938 --> 37:13.608
Your suit is
two years out of fashion,

37:13.690 --> 37:15.150
your shoes abominable,

37:15.233 --> 37:19.663
your dancing ridiculous--
I’m leading, you are not--

37:19.738 --> 37:22.118
and because this gentleman

37:22.199 --> 37:24.239
clearly doesn’t know you
at all.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.156
Oh. (giggles)

37:26.244 --> 37:28.254
AMELIA:
Thank you for the dance.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.710
JAMES: I didn’t realize
that appearances

37:29.790 --> 37:31.460
were so important to you,
and I’m sorry

37:31.541 --> 37:33.841
that I don’t live up
to this society standard.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.129
I don’t care
what shoes you wear.

37:35.212 --> 37:36.302
I care that you’re lying to me.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.420
It’ll be your balloon.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.933
All I ask is
to be given the freedom

37:42.010 --> 37:43.140
to undertake my experiments.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.720
I’m not a coachman for hire.

37:44.805 --> 37:47.805
Good, because I’m looking
for a fellow scientist.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.811
To understand the weather,
Miss Wren, is to understand

37:50.894 --> 37:53.024
how to make ships
and sailors safer,

37:53.105 --> 37:54.555
farms more productive,

37:54.648 --> 37:58.488
so we can prepare ourselves
and our world for floods,

37:58.568 --> 38:01.448
for droughts, famines.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.660
We could save
thousands of lives.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.120
I want to rewrite the rules
of the air, Miss Wren.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.995
And I need your help.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.843
So, will you...

38:17.170 --> 38:18.920
...help me?

38:28.098 --> 38:30.058
-(hammering)
-(machines clacking)

38:33.145 --> 38:35.305
AMELIA:
Yeah, this seems much more...

38:35.397 --> 38:37.647
ANTONIA:
You’re punishing me!

38:37.733 --> 38:39.993
I’m not sure a factory
full of flammable gases

38:40.068 --> 38:41.318
is the safest place
for children.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.743
You’re punishing me
for dragging you

38:42.821 --> 38:43.911
to that ridiculous evening.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.659
No, I am grateful to you
for dragging me

38:45.741 --> 38:46.951
to that ridiculous evening.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.994
I’d not made the acquaintance
of Mr. Glaisher otherwise.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.117
-(Antonia scoffs)
-Now, girls,

38:50.203 --> 38:52.503
I believe we have
some macaroons somewhere.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.461
If that is not proof
of you punishing me,

38:54.541 --> 38:57.041
-then I do not know what is.
-Not here.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.957
I hated you going up
in the air with Pierre,

38:59.046 --> 39:02.216
but why you’d want to go up
on your own, I can’t even...

39:02.299 --> 39:04.049
With Mr. Glaisher.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.724
You’re my only sister.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.972
I do not wish to lose you
to any more... foolishness.

39:09.056 --> 39:11.266
You’d rather I found a man
prepared to marry me

39:11.349 --> 39:12.979
to devote myself to.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.810
I’d rather you found a way
to make yourself happy.

39:15.896 --> 39:17.516
You can’t just fly away
from your problems.

39:17.606 --> 39:21.896
You have to face them here,
on earth, with the rest of us.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.445
Look, Antonia,
I am a really good aeronaut,

39:25.530 --> 39:27.450
and I want to use
what I’m good at.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.332
Yeah, but you are
a highly accomplished woman.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.989
You could be good
at so many things.

39:31.078 --> 39:33.038
You could have the most
beautiful life in society,

39:33.121 --> 39:34.041
if only you’d try.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.542
And if that isn’t what I want?

39:35.624 --> 39:38.174
Then you have to learn
to want it.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.711
Up there,

39:40.796 --> 39:44.376
it’s where I have found
the greatest happiness.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.546
(Antonia scoffs)

39:47.052 --> 39:51.262
He was the happiness,
not the damn balloon.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.851
Come on, girls. We’re going
to be late for lunch.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.927
(ropes creaking softly)

40:41.398 --> 40:43.978
JAMES: So, have you been
this high before?

40:44.067 --> 40:45.357
AMELIA:
Only once.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.403
With Pierre?

40:53.660 --> 40:56.120
We have time enough.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.914
Why don’t you tell me
about him?

40:57.998 --> 41:00.748
Ashamed as I am to not stick

41:00.834 --> 41:03.004
to your
conversational schedule,

41:03.086 --> 41:04.956
I have nothing to tell.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.845
-Does your head not hurt?
-No.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.469
I can’t feel it. Sorry, I’m...

41:14.556 --> 41:16.466
I didn’t mean to...

41:18.185 --> 41:19.475
What happened to you,

41:19.561 --> 41:21.561
I didn’t mean
to make light of it.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.070
(James groans quietly)

41:31.156 --> 41:33.196
It will heal.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.582
You won’t have a scar.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.293
(Amelia gasps softly)

41:40.373 --> 41:42.293
At this height?

41:42.375 --> 41:43.705
Look. (gasps)

41:43.793 --> 41:46.213
(chuckles)

41:48.215 --> 41:49.295
(James chuckles)

41:58.433 --> 42:00.483
(chuckling):
Look.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.731
-(James chuckles)
-(Amelia sighs)

42:06.733 --> 42:08.903
-JAMES: He was right.
-(chuckles)

42:08.985 --> 42:11.485
The fool was right.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.321
Of all the amazing things.

42:14.407 --> 42:18.117
My friend John-- John Trew--
he made a study of them.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.083
So, he theorized,
beyond the birds,

42:20.163 --> 42:22.123
an air current
on which only insects travel,

42:22.207 --> 42:23.787
and I never believed him.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.875
And I certainly never thought
that we would prove him right.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.716
Careful.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.511
Oh.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.516
There she goes.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.361
JAMES: Where are they heading,
do you think?

42:47.440 --> 42:50.650
AMELIA: Perhaps they trust
the wind to decide.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.125
He’d have liked these.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.090
Pierre.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.971
My husband was...

43:19.055 --> 43:21.135
the bravest man I knew.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.351
He saw possibilities
others could not, but...

43:27.939 --> 43:31.069
...his most enduring quality
was a deep...

43:33.153 --> 43:36.113
and true love
for the beauty of the world.

44:01.806 --> 44:02.926
Thank you.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.864
Others would have
pushed me further.

44:08.938 --> 44:12.528
Thank you... for not.

44:14.402 --> 44:17.412
I cannot quantify
what you’ve lost.

44:19.574 --> 44:20.584
No.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.367
You can’t.

44:31.252 --> 44:32.752
(sniffles softly)

44:37.258 --> 44:40.098
Return to your instruments,
Mr. Glaisher.

44:52.107 --> 44:54.857
I said return
to your instruments.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.994
I shall.

45:07.247 --> 45:08.707
(drawer opens)

45:10.834 --> 45:12.294
(drawer closes)

45:53.877 --> 45:55.917
(quiet chatter)

46:04.512 --> 46:06.102
MAN:
Is she lost?

46:06.181 --> 46:08.141
AIRY:
Wren, isn’t it?

46:08.224 --> 46:10.104
Amelia Wren?

46:11.603 --> 46:14.063
I’m looking for James Glaisher.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.397
You’re very welcome
to wait outside

46:16.483 --> 46:18.573
while we fetch him to you.

46:18.651 --> 46:21.781
You see, we have a policy
toward the fairer sex...

46:21.863 --> 46:23.743
Then I’ll find him myself.

46:23.823 --> 46:25.623
Lovely to see you again,
Charles.

46:30.413 --> 46:31.963
-JAMES: Time, Johnny?
-(watch ticking)

46:32.040 --> 46:34.580
JOHN:
17 seconds.

46:34.667 --> 46:36.787
Come on, James.
Imagine you’re hurtling

46:36.878 --> 46:38.048
-towards the ground.
-(James scoffs)

46:38.129 --> 46:40.299
Hurry, man. Your equipment’s
gonna be destroyed.

46:40.381 --> 46:41.551
JAMES:
Yep.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.593
-26 seconds. Well done.
-(footsteps approaching)

46:43.676 --> 46:46.296
And you said
I couldn’t break 30.

46:47.347 --> 46:49.677
-My senses deserted me.
-Miss Wren.

46:49.766 --> 46:50.886
-This is an honor.
-I do not wish to abandon you...

46:50.975 --> 46:53.895
-May I give you a tour?
-...but I’m afraid I must.

46:55.522 --> 46:57.232
Abandon me?

47:01.861 --> 47:04.661
The build is already under way.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.659
The largest balloon
ever on order.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.911
I don’t want to climb inside
the balloon, Mr. Glaisher.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.373
I don’t want to climb
into a balloon ever again.

47:17.794 --> 47:19.924
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.764
No, no, no,
that is not acceptable.

47:21.839 --> 47:25.219
A vast amount of money
has already been spent.

47:25.301 --> 47:27.181
I’m sorry, sir.

47:28.471 --> 47:30.641
I have made my decision.

47:42.819 --> 47:44.989
(clocks and watches ticking)

47:47.740 --> 47:50.370
-(bell jingling)
-(hoofbeats clopping outside)

47:50.451 --> 47:51.951
Evening, Ma.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.156
ETHEL:
The wanderer returns.

47:55.498 --> 47:57.998
-You were due last week.
-Yes, I know I was.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.924
Sorry. I’ve been, uh...
I’ve been having some...

48:01.004 --> 48:05.684
Yes, we’ve been reading all
about you in the newspapers.

48:08.052 --> 48:11.062
Of all the people, James.

48:11.139 --> 48:14.929
Women don’t belong
in balloons, on show.

48:15.018 --> 48:18.558
And she makes
such a show of herself.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.896
Your reputation risks ruin.

48:20.982 --> 48:22.532
Well, you’ll be pleased
to hear, Ma,

48:22.609 --> 48:24.689
that the expedition’s off.

48:24.777 --> 48:28.067
It was Miss Wren who wouldn’t
risk flight with me.

48:28.156 --> 48:29.566
Is he upstairs?

48:29.657 --> 48:33.657
James, his mind’s been
playing tricks on him again.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.285
It’s got worse?

48:35.371 --> 48:37.251
It comes and goes.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.422
Tread carefully with him.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.381
Hard at it?

48:45.465 --> 48:48.965
-Ethel! Ethel!
-Oh, Pa, Pa, it’s me.

48:49.052 --> 48:51.102
-It’s James.
-Ethel!

48:51.179 --> 48:53.679
Listen, Ma knows I’m here.
It’s James.

48:53.765 --> 48:55.135
I’m your son.

48:55.224 --> 48:58.024
You’re--
M-My son’s only ten years old.

48:58.102 --> 49:00.152
I got older.

49:02.857 --> 49:05.817
Now, what have you been... what
have you been looking at here?

49:05.902 --> 49:08.402
Oh, get away from that.

49:10.031 --> 49:13.031
Pallas?
You’ve been looking at Pallas?

49:16.454 --> 49:18.544
Course I’m looking at Pallas.

49:19.749 --> 49:21.579
Good spotting.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.835
-Here.
-Do not pretend

49:25.922 --> 49:27.632
that you can see anything
through those.

49:27.715 --> 49:32.385
These are the glasses I taught
you to stargaze through.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.520
They’re quite sufficient
for some work.

49:38.434 --> 49:40.234
Your trip.

49:41.187 --> 49:43.517
You’re going on a trip.

49:43.606 --> 49:45.566
In a balloon.

49:46.943 --> 49:48.743
Yes, I’m trying to, Pa.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.490
Yeah.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.371
To see the stars.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.408
I hope so.

49:54.492 --> 49:57.622
I used to dream
of taking my bedsheet,

49:57.704 --> 50:00.004
catching a gust of wind

50:00.081 --> 50:03.331
and dancing in a parachute
among the stars.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.418
I know you did. You told me.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.883
Mm. Nothing...

50:07.964 --> 50:12.724
nothing m-more mysterious,
nor more beautiful,

50:12.802 --> 50:15.302
than the stars in the sky.

50:26.482 --> 50:28.322
ARTHUR:
Mm.

50:30.194 --> 50:33.284
Wh-What are you doing in here?

50:33.364 --> 50:35.624
Y-You know the rules.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.790
Not in my room.

50:37.869 --> 50:40.579
-I-I...
-And keep away
from that spyglass.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.173
It’s very valuable, James.

50:42.248 --> 50:44.708
I know it is, Pa.
I bought it for you.

50:44.792 --> 50:46.342
-He’s tired.
-Oh.

50:46.419 --> 50:47.879
Probably best
not to overdo it.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.842
Thank you, Ethel.
Get this lad out of here.

50:49.922 --> 50:51.012
Yes, dear.

50:51.090 --> 50:52.880
Leave it while you’re
still on the up.

50:54.093 --> 50:57.393
Good night. I will, um...

50:57.472 --> 50:59.062
I’ll see you next week.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.140
(kisses)

51:03.060 --> 51:04.440
James.

51:07.774 --> 51:09.654
For your trip.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.290
(sniffles) Thank you.

51:21.204 --> 51:23.294
Prove them wrong, James.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.917
Next week.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.012
(door closes)

51:33.090 --> 51:34.550
(footsteps retreating)

51:34.634 --> 51:36.054
Mm.

51:37.053 --> 51:39.183
Mr. Green?

51:39.263 --> 51:41.393
Mr. Green, sir? Sir.

51:41.474 --> 51:44.144
If it isn’t Mr. Glaisher,
the weather sleuth.

51:44.227 --> 51:45.977
I believe he prefers
to be described

51:46.062 --> 51:47.402
as a meteorologist, Charles.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.900
Of course he does.
Well, best of luck with it.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.282
As I’m sure you’re aware, sir,

51:51.359 --> 51:52.989
I’ve not been able
to attract the funds,

51:53.069 --> 51:54.649
either from the Royal Society
or elsewhere,

51:54.737 --> 51:55.987
that I need to fly.

51:56.072 --> 51:57.412
It is an expensive
preoccupation.

51:57.490 --> 51:58.740
I’ve heard that you’re looking

51:58.825 --> 52:00.325
-to make another
balloon ascent.
-I am.

52:00.409 --> 52:02.789
Well, I would like the
opportunity to be your second.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.370
I will prove
a willing accomplice, sir.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.785
I have also strong ideas
as to how to increase

52:06.874 --> 52:08.424
the hydrogen levels
in the coal gas

52:08.501 --> 52:10.341
that I believe might be
your unlocking,

52:10.419 --> 52:12.799
and you might finally be able
to break that height record.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.470
Have you even been
in a balloon?

52:14.549 --> 52:16.759
I’ve studied them extensively.

52:16.843 --> 52:20.263
Do you have any experience
of frostbite, low air pressure,

52:20.346 --> 52:23.056
the mind-altering effects of
a lack of oxygen to the brain?

52:23.140 --> 52:25.690
How else does one learn
but by partaking?

52:25.768 --> 52:28.898
Exactly what I need
in a second: a theorist

52:28.980 --> 52:31.980
with no ideas about
the true dangers of the air.

52:32.066 --> 52:34.566
Find another madman
to get in a balloon with.

52:34.652 --> 52:36.742
Uh, perhaps the French.

52:37.947 --> 52:40.617
Or, better yet, that woman.

52:40.700 --> 52:42.370
Good day.

52:53.629 --> 52:55.969
JAMES:
22,200.

52:56.048 --> 52:58.048
AMELIA: Do you have faith
in these thermometers?

52:58.134 --> 52:59.724
22,400.

52:59.802 --> 53:04.182
If so, we’re at 21 degrees,
and that is cold.

53:04.265 --> 53:07.885
22,500. Well, you can note
that temperature down.

53:10.354 --> 53:12.734
Hmm. You trust me
to write in your book?

53:12.815 --> 53:14.895
I am honored. (chuckles)

53:20.573 --> 53:23.123
Have we slowed?
Are we not at 22,600?

53:23.200 --> 53:25.580
Oh, so you are interested.
(chuckles)

53:25.661 --> 53:27.541
And now we’ve passed 22,600.

53:27.622 --> 53:30.502
-You’re insufferable.
-You are excited.

53:32.418 --> 53:36.838
And that is 22,700.

53:39.634 --> 53:43.394
-History will be rewritten.
-22,900.

53:47.183 --> 53:49.273
BOTH:
23,000.

53:53.022 --> 53:55.112
We are now higher

53:55.191 --> 53:59.111
than any man or any woman

53:59.195 --> 54:01.405
has ever been.

54:01.489 --> 54:03.239
(James chuckles)

54:29.058 --> 54:31.228
(ropes creaking softly)

54:37.316 --> 54:39.856
Thank you for taking me up
in your balloon, Mr. Glaisher.

54:39.944 --> 54:43.114
Thank you for taking me up
in your balloon, Miss Wren.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.581
It doesn’t feel different
at all, does it?

54:55.668 --> 54:57.918
On the contrary.

54:58.004 --> 54:59.464
This is the moment that

54:59.547 --> 55:02.087
I’ve been waiting for
my entire life.

55:04.051 --> 55:07.221
I rather suspect
I’ve been waiting for it, too.

55:14.061 --> 55:16.611
JAMES:
Right. Now...

55:23.195 --> 55:24.735
(pigeon cooing)

55:24.822 --> 55:27.702
AMELIA: You still think
we might not make it back?

55:27.783 --> 55:30.793
I’m just sending a message
to Charles Green.

55:38.794 --> 55:41.054
23,900 feet.

55:41.130 --> 55:43.380
We’re rising
even more quickly now.

55:43.466 --> 55:44.926
Did you know? Could you tell?

55:45.009 --> 55:47.299
It’s because the air’s thinner.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.176
AMELIA:
She’s expanding.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.473
We should think of slowing.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.846
So, the air is
aiding our ascent.

55:52.933 --> 55:54.523
(chuckles):
Isn’t that outstanding?

55:54.602 --> 55:56.852
AMELIA: Surely, now is the time
to put your oilskins on.

55:56.937 --> 55:59.317
Didn’t bring any oilskins.
They proved extremely heavy.

55:59.398 --> 56:00.818
I told you
that you needed oilskins.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.900
Well, the equipment
was essential.

56:02.985 --> 56:03.985
The weight limit was essential.

56:04.070 --> 56:05.450
If I’m to get a little sick
returning...

56:05.529 --> 56:07.029
A little sick?
You-you carry four thermometers,

56:07.114 --> 56:08.124
you carry this strange box,

56:08.199 --> 56:09.579
but you-you couldn’t bring
suitable clothing

56:09.658 --> 56:11.288
-for the cold and the wet?
-Keep moving.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.328
Don’t stop. The cold will only
catch you if you let it.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.292
We need to go down now.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.922
Wait. No, no, we’re not
descending. Not yet.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.710
The best way to break a storm
is to travel up.

56:19.794 --> 56:21.554
I quote you, dear lady.
Well, maybe the best way

56:21.629 --> 56:23.259
to break a cold is also
to travel up.

56:23.339 --> 56:24.969
And which science
are you basing that upon?

56:25.049 --> 56:27.129
The science that says,
with every layer of air,

56:27.218 --> 56:28.928
we are traveling
into an unknown.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.431
So, with every layer of air,
we are traveling

56:30.513 --> 56:32.723
-closer to the sun.
-I believe we have
already accomplished...

56:32.807 --> 56:34.597
So these findings
that I am still to discover,

56:34.683 --> 56:36.603
-they could be overwhelming.
-You are freezing.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.345
-Please. What have we to lose?
-Our lives.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.937
This could be more important
than our lives!

56:45.236 --> 56:48.566
Please. I know that you
want this as much as I do.

56:52.284 --> 56:54.374
I’m descending.

56:56.288 --> 56:57.868
Stop. (grunting)

56:57.957 --> 56:59.207
No.

56:59.291 --> 57:00.841
So, this balloon has defied

57:00.918 --> 57:02.838
every single thing
that we have thrown at it.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.090
This is not about the balloon.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.172
This is not about science.

57:07.258 --> 57:10.258
This is about your war with
those who lord it over you.

57:10.344 --> 57:11.724
-And I have fought them, too.
-(scoffs)

57:11.804 --> 57:13.064
-This is, this is not...
-I...

57:13.139 --> 57:14.389
This is, this is about that.

57:15.850 --> 57:17.640
Look at it.

57:19.645 --> 57:22.515
There’s nothing more beautiful,

57:22.606 --> 57:25.566
nor more mysterious,
than the stars in the sky.

57:25.651 --> 57:27.531
And look at us.

57:29.113 --> 57:31.623
We are dancing amongst them.

57:46.964 --> 57:50.134
You wanted that writing
on the balloon, Amelia.

57:50.217 --> 57:51.927
"Caelum certe...

57:52.011 --> 57:55.011
-patet, ibimus illi."
-"Patet, ibimus illi."

57:56.515 --> 58:00.805
"Surely, the sky lies open.

58:00.895 --> 58:02.555
Let us go that way."

58:02.646 --> 58:04.106
The sky is open.

58:05.274 --> 58:06.984
It is open.

58:09.111 --> 58:11.911
Now, you understand

58:11.989 --> 58:13.909
there will come a time
when we go no further?

58:13.991 --> 58:15.451
Yes, I do.

58:16.744 --> 58:19.164
Do you understand

58:19.246 --> 58:22.246
that decision
will only be mine?

58:23.459 --> 58:25.129
Yes, I do.

58:47.733 --> 58:49.363
JAMES:
Thank you.

58:49.443 --> 58:52.113
Tell me when we land
if I deserve your thanks.

58:52.196 --> 58:54.156
(sniffs)

58:54.240 --> 58:56.330
You deserve my thanks.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.498
(bell jingling)

59:10.714 --> 59:12.384
Good evening, Miss Wren.

59:14.134 --> 59:15.804
I’ve made my decision,
Mr. Trew.

59:15.886 --> 59:19.466
And I understand that. I just
wanted to gift you this book.

59:30.693 --> 59:32.113
AMELIA:
These are beautiful.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.154
JOHN: They’re pictures
of snowflake formations.

59:34.238 --> 59:37.238
A study of the mathematical
possibilities of nature,

59:37.324 --> 59:39.204
a study undertaken by James...

59:39.285 --> 59:40.575
James Glaisher.

59:41.954 --> 59:43.964
He believes
the sky can be understood.

59:44.039 --> 59:46.709
Of this I am well aware.

59:46.792 --> 59:48.462
He is, sadly,
occasionally wrong.

59:48.544 --> 59:50.924
He predicted it would snow
tonight, would you believe.

59:51.005 --> 59:55.965
But more often than not,
he finds remarkable truths.

59:56.051 --> 59:58.351
Travel with him,
and you will discover this.

59:58.429 --> 59:59.759
-I have.
-I’m sorry.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.597
I... I-I clearly told him no.

01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:03.642
He should not have sent you
to convince me.

01:00:03.726 --> 01:00:04.766
He didn’t send me.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:06.352
He’d consider me
a poor persuader.

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:08.977
-I’m here on my own account.
-You will not dissuade me

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:10.444
-from my path, Mr. Trew.
-James believes

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.574
there’s something
extraordinary up there.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.451
And so this is an opportunity
I should not miss?

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.528
You misunderstand me.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.122
It’s not an opportunity
but an obligation.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:22.788
In this life, few are given
the chance to change the world.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.080
You’ve been assigned
a responsibility, Miss Wren.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:30.292
You have to meet it.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:37.761
Enjoy the book, madam.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.650
(door opens, closes)

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.437
(wind whistling)

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.897
(ropes creaking)

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.202
-JAMES: Height?
-Height, height.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.869
-Mm.
-26,500 feet.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.951
26... And temperature?

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.826
And temperature...

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.884
-five degrees Fahrenheit.
-(quietly): Five.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.708
(James sniffs)

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.051
(James sighs)

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:41.631
It’s the strangest thing.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:46.097
So, the higher that we fly,
the lower the humidity.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.350
(Amelia panting)

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.931
There’s barely any
water vapor here at all.

01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:53.848
AMELIA:
There is still ice.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.517
(James grunts, sniffs)

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:58.436
These temperatures,
they’re unprecedented.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:01.145
These are freezing ranges that
no one would have predicted.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.606
AMELIA:
Yeah.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.446
JAMES:
And what was that temperature?

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.121
AMELIA:
Um, five degrees.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.040
JAMES:
Five...

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:11.909
(paper rips)

01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:14.877
Oh, come on.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.381
(grunts)

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:19.757
(grunts):
Right.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.680
-(pigeon cooing)
-Out you come.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:30.390
(grunts, sniffs)

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.885
(flapping wings slow and stop)

01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:38.322
No concern necessary.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.358
We have another.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:43.533
We don’t have another.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:46.702
(grunts)

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:48.332
AMELIA:
What are you doing?

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.038
-Losing weight.
-L-Losing weight?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.288
A mere consequence of
the decrease in air pressure.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:53.461
This-this balloon
isn’t safe, James.

01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:54.829
And much more severe
than I’d anticipated.

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:56.535
James, the-the pressure
on the material could lead

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.955
-to rips, and at...
-The coal gas has expanded,
and...

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.884
...this altitude, these-these
rips could definitely be fatal.

01:04:00.963 --> 01:04:02.133
-What are you doing?!
-(James muttering)

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:03.594
We can’t lose more weight!

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:08.434
No! (grunts)

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.262
Give me the sandbag!

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.307
It is time we descend.

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:13.681
I will not stop

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.807
because you can’t withstand
a little pressure.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.274
(panting)

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.234
Don’t you see what’s happening?

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:21.154
(panting)

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.367
James, the lack of oxygen
is affecting your brain.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.044
We’re going to die
unless we descend now.

01:04:37.124 --> 01:04:40.544
Your husband risked your life
for his own recklessness.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.457
I do the same, but for science.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:45.376
-(grunts)
-You know nothing
of my husband’s death.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:52.095
It is well known that he pushed
harder than he should have.

01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:58.102
Now imagine that story again,

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:02.436
and imagine this time
that I am the pilot...

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:08.105
...that h-he told me to stop,

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.736
that I-I was risking
the balloon.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:12.704
PIERRE:
How bad is the tear?!

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.874
(wind rushing)

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.963
(air hissing)

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:21.997
The seams ripped apart.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:28.796
I... I fought...

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:32.474
too hard for my place
at the table.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.144
AMELIA:
We’re falling too fast.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.312
PIERRE:
We’re going to die here!

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.271
We need to lose more weight!

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.356
Come on. There must be
something. Think. Think.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.152
-Yes. Yes.
-Think.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:53.492
(grunts)

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.785
Thank you for giving me
somewhere I belonged.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.080
Keep looking up.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.623
No! Pierre! No!

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.756
(exhales sharply)

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.802
(James exhales)

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.966
JAMES:
Amelia.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.773
I’m so sorry.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.404
Do not...

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.530
be responsible...

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.858
for the death of another.

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:32.611
It’s one mistake

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:35.448
you’ll never
forgive yourself for.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:39.868
I’m so sorry.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.592
Really, I am.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.170
Now...

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:52.181
...let’s get this balloon down.

01:06:54.136 --> 01:06:55.716
Yes.

01:07:05.105 --> 01:07:06.895
I think...

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.238
I-I think we’ve...

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.780
discovered that oxygen is...

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:19.447
(thud, ropes creaking)

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.536
(grunts)

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:26.245
-(thudding, creaking)
-(grunting, panting)

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.464
Open, damn it.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.835
Open.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.005
(creaking)

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.182
(grunting)

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.352
-(thud)
-(grunts) Come on!

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:46.478
(grunts)

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.273
(panting)

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:49.566
Come on!

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.689
(shuddering breaths)

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:54.147
-(thud)
-AMELIA (muffled): Come on!

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:58.986
-(thud)
-(muffled scream)

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:04.501
James. James.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.791
-You have to keep moving.
-Yes.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.875
You... If you lay still,

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.550
then-then the hypoxia
will set in.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.592
The gas release valve
is frozen.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:18.144
I... I need to climb up
and open it.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:22.020
Stay alive.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.808
-(grunts)
-Stay alive.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.363
Stay alive.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.398
(Amelia grunts)

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.787
(grunts)

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.957
(gasps, grunts)

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.126
(strained grunting)

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.309
-(grunting)
-(ropes creaking)

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.031
(faint grunting)

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.671
(grunting)

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:49.393
(panting)

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.700
(grunting)

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:07.951
(grunts)

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.878
PIERRE:
Amelia. Amelia.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.474
Regarde-moi.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.889
(wind whistling)

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.509
Thank you...

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.306
...for giving me
somewhere I belonged.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.410
(grunts)

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.705
(strained grunting)

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.427
(grunting, panting)

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.040
(grunts)

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:35.039
(gasping)

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:40.045
(grunting)

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:08.203
(grunting)

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:45.949
(grunts)

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:53.947
(breath trembling)

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.747
(muffled thud)

01:12:57.207 --> 01:12:59.627
(panting)

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.230
(panting)

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.185
(shouts)

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:28.858
-(grunts)
-(ice creaking)

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.037
-(shouts, gasping)
-(air hissing)

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:43.335
-(grunts)
-(creaking)

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.549
(air continues hissing)

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.797
(grunts)

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.471
(grunts)

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:55.175
(panting)

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.016
-(air hissing quietly)
-(grunting, thudding)

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.291
(creaking)

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.448
(air continues hissing)

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.999
(soft creaking)

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:06.292
(ice crackling softly)

01:15:16.221 --> 01:15:17.721
(grunts)

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.845
(screaming)

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:23.104
-(ropes thud)
-(screaming stops)

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:28.778
-(bells chiming)
-(clock ticking)

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:35.275
-Should we have heard
anything by now?
-No.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:38.365
We’ll only hear
if there’s a disaster.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:41.201
The less we hear, the...

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.367
better her chances.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.710
-Then we pray for silence?
-Yes.

01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:49.844
Pray for silence.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:01.268
(quiet chatter)

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:10.226
Still no sign of them.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:12.436
-(clock ticking)
-(quiet chatter)

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.582
(muffled thumping)

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.959
(wind whistling softly)

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.007
(ropes creaking)

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.385
(gasping)

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:39.178
Oh, God.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:49.482
James!

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:53.073
(strained grunting)

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:55.031
Come on.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.451
Oh, God.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.029
(grunting)

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.825
Come on. James!

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:04.119
-Come on.
-(rope creaking)

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:07.123
(grunting)

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:08.876
Come on.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.210
(strained grunting)

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.837
(faint grunting)

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.474
(whimpers)

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.934
(strained grunting)

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:25.515
(panting)

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:28.393
Come on.

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:30.858
(grunting)

01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:37.239
(grunting)

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.581
(panting)

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.078
(grunting)

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.338
(Amelia continues grunting)

01:17:56.798 --> 01:18:00.218
(groans, grunts)

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.431
(panting)

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.152
James.

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:20.702
James. James.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.280
James.

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:25.199
James.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.199
James, we’ve survived.

01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:32.248
We’re going down.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:33.923
James.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.711
James, James.

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:36.795
James.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.176
James?

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.400
We’re going down.

01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:59.244
I can’t have this happen again.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:03.656
(sniffles softly)

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.540
James.

01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:13.501
(chuckles)

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.049
(sniffles)

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.137
Your strange two-tube device

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:27.388
is doing something
very peculiar, you know.

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:30.812
(slurred):
You’re meaning my hygrometer.

01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:33.312
(sniffles)

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:34.944
It’s bubbling.

01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:37.521
Could that not be significant?

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:39.397
It could.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.236
We’re descending.

01:19:48.326 --> 01:19:50.116
(stammers, sniffs)

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:51.623
We are.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:56.499
I’ve been... insensible.

01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:58.504
You have. (chuckles)

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:02.376
And I think I lost my head.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.088
It does seem that way.

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:14.189
Well, come on, then.

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:17.188
(grunting)

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.574
(panting)

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.245
Time: one hour,

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.868
-11 minutes and 19 seconds.
-(chuckles)

01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:36.916
Height?

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:43.384
28,600 feet.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:47.554
-(chuckles) And temperature?
-(creaking)

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:49.255
Unknown.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.925
That equipment’s
been lost to us.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:55.274
-And my hygrometer’s
had better days.
-(drawer opens)

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:59.481
This is of
no great use, either.

01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:01.234
(Amelia laughs)

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.935
Our readings on the descent
shall be less significant.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:08.356
Oh, your hands.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:11.407
(breathing heavily)

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:18.752
So, you didn’t have room for
oils, but you did for brandy?

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:21.923
Well, a scientist is nothing
without his equipment.

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:23.923
-Hold out your hands.
-(scoffs)

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:25.665
What are you gonna do?

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.006
This is gonna hurt a bit.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.301
I’m sorry,
but you need to hold them out.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:34.015
-(yells, gasps)
-I know.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.768
(groans) That hurt.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:40.561
-Is that, uh, any better?
-No.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:41.896
Worse.

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:49.195
I don’t know
what you did for me up there,

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.660
but I have no doubt
that it was a great act.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.248
-Your poor hands.
-AMELIA: Look.

01:22:05.338 --> 01:22:07.418
And now snow.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.506
Oh.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:11.341
As if we haven’t had enough.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.297
It’ll pass.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.648
It’s possibly interesting
to analyze the melt water.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.769
(steady ticking)

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:33.881
(wind whistling)

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.006
My sister wanted to know

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:41.598
why I would ever
go up in a balloon again.

01:23:43.436 --> 01:23:46.936
I think it was because
I wanted...

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:52.032
all that I knew,
all that he taught me...

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:58.581
...all that I’ve lost
to be for something.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.837
Well...

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.469
I need to make sense
of all of this

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.428
before I can work out
quite what we’ve achieved,

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.088
but it, uh...

01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:18.547
it seems that the atmosphere
has levels to it.

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:21.517
-That’s-that’s not what I mean.
-It has patterns within it.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.610
Newton said that we build
too many walls

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:34.242
-and not enough bridges.
-I don’t want to hear
from Newton.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:38.530
I want to hear from you.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:52.212
All my life,
I’ve found comfort in science.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:59.550
It helps give meaning to the
many things we can’t control.

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:03.847
It brings a degree of order
to the...

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:06.273
chaos that surrounds us.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:13.318
But whilst we may be able
to explain the science

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.530
behind an aureole
or the falling snow...

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:25.080
...it’s not possible
to account for its beauty.

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:32.287
Together...

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:34.958
we’ve brought
the stars closer.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:40.548
We have brought
the stars closer.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.620
Do you notice something
about the snow?

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:07.785
(wind whistling)

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:10.582
-It’s not falling.
-(steady ticking)

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.086
It’s hovering.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.205
It’s static.

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:18.587
JAMES:
Strange. What might be...

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.594
We might, if we were traveling
at the same speed as it.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.097
The same speed as snow?

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.558
The gas, it’s still escaping.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:26.388
Combined with the decrease
in pressure, it means...

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:27.563
That the balloon’s collapsing.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.061
AMELIA:
Quick, help me!

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.654
Pull!

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:33.609
-Pull!
-(air hissing)

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:36.982
-What on earth was that?
-My shoe.

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:40.646
Probably best
not to question it.

01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:43.068
But if your shoe was up there,
that means that...

01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:44.737
Maybe we save the thanks
for later.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:46.365
We need to lose weight.

01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:48.332
A lot of weight. Now!

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:55.793
(grunting, panting)

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:57.458
Come on.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.046
The chest! The chest!

01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:00.551
I’ll do it.

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.593
-One, two.
-(Amelia grunts)

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:17.404
(grunting)

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.530
AMELIA:
We should lose our jackets.

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:26.025
My hands.

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.116
Help me.

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:29.201
Yeah. I’ll do it.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.616
Come on!

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:36.752
It’s not working, Amelia!

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.545
It’s not working!

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.507
(creaking)

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:46.505
Climb into the hoop.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.555
-What?
-Amelia, climb into the hoop!

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:51.599
We need to lose the basket!
It’s the heaviest weight!

01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:53.314
Come on!

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.153
Quick!

01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:04.236
Come on!

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:11.044
(shouting)

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.156
(screams)

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:17.634
AMELIA:
That’s it!

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:19.880
-(James grunts)
-(Amelia yells)

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:33.228
-Come on!
-(James yells)

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:39.114
(grunts)

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:40.609
-(gasping)
-One more!

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.955
(grunting, gasping)

01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:57.039
Hold on!

01:28:59.752 --> 01:29:01.502
(both scream)

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:11.642
It’s not enough!

01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:14.982
-We’re still too fast.
-It will be enough.

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:19.687
Amelia?

01:29:19.772 --> 01:29:21.402
Amelia, what are you doing?

01:29:21.482 --> 01:29:24.572
I’m not sure I was meant
to survive this.

01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:27.611
Amelia, no! Get back down!

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.906
Amelia!

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:33.986
Amelia!

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:39.209
Bedsheets.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.711
Amelia, bedsheets!

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:44.304
We sever the cord
keeping the balloon in shape,

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.339
and then the silk will be
pulled up into the netting

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:48.513
and act as a parachute.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.010
-It’s not going to work!
-It will work!

01:29:52.096 --> 01:29:53.096
I’m not returning alone.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.470
Amelia, I’m not
returning alone.

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.476
It’s either both of us
or neither of us.

01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:00.267
Hold on!

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.363
We hold on!

01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:06.033
Whoa! (gasping)

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.910
(gasps, yells)

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:17.293
(panting)

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:25.923
(yells)

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.880
JAMES:
It worked!

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:32.851
It worked!

01:30:35.139 --> 01:30:37.059
(chuckles)

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:43.769
It’s not over yet.

01:30:43.856 --> 01:30:46.896
(both screaming)

01:30:48.569 --> 01:30:51.529
(both grunting, yelling)

01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:54.196
James!

01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:59.000
(screams)

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:21.438
(birds chirping)

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:53.676
(grunting quietly)

01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:06.361
James!

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.694
James!

01:32:13.487 --> 01:32:15.067
James!

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:18.865
James!

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:21.331
JAMES (in distance):
Amelia?

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:24.291
James! (chuckles)

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:30.208
-James!
-Amelia, I’m coming!

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.955
James!

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:37.393
-James!
-Amelia!

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.299
(laughs):
James.

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:42.312
Amelia!

01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:43.681
(laughs)

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:45.347
James.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:47.305
I was just coming to find you.

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:50.898
Not very quickly, it seems.

01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:54.029
(James groans)

01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:00.373
Can you stand?

01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:02.370
I’d rather not.

01:33:05.539 --> 01:33:07.419
And if I help you?

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:13.339
Then I would stand.

01:33:18.135 --> 01:33:21.385
(James grunting)

01:33:40.157 --> 01:33:41.617
(Amelia chuckles)

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:49.118
AMELIA:
It was estimated

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:54.417
that we rose to a height
of 37,000 feet that day.

01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:57.054
Seven miles high.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.262
ARTHUR:
"Two aeronauts

01:33:59.343 --> 01:34:02.933
"have been nearer
to the Moon and stars

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:06.183
than all the race of man
before them."

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:09.226
The Times, Ethel.
You read it?

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:12.061
ETHEL: Yes, Arthur,
I’ve read it. (chuckles)

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.187
(chuckles softly)

01:34:15.734 --> 01:34:17.154
My boy.

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:20.605
AMELIA: James Glaisher’s
meticulous recording of data

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:23.947
showed that the atmosphere
has different layers within it,

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:25.454
a discovery which led

01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:28.535
to the first scientific
weather forecasts.

01:34:28.622 --> 01:34:31.252
The fact that I am able
to be here at all

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:36.633
to present this to you
is due to some luck,

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:38.263
some help...

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:44.465
...and Amelia Wren’s
remarkable courage.

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:50.058
So, we tell our story

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:53.523
not for the purposes
of pleasure

01:34:53.605 --> 01:34:56.725
but for the advancement
of knowledge...

01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:00.486
...and for the good of us all.

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:01.700
(applause)

01:35:14.668 --> 01:35:16.458
AMELIA:
We took to the skies

01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:20.795
in the name of discovery,
to find something new,

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:23.262
to change the world.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:26.853
Come on! I’ve flown
in worse weather than this!

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.020
-We’ll make pilots of you yet.
-(laughter)

01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:32.981
We won’t.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.396
AMELIA:
But you don’t change the world

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:39.361
simply by looking at it.

01:35:39.443 --> 01:35:42.953
You change it through the way
you choose to live in it.

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:07.795
Look up.

01:36:07.888 --> 01:36:11.388
The sky lies open.
