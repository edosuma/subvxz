WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:05.338
.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.131
- I sure could use some help

00:07.132 --> 00:08.216
down at Molly's
tomorrow night.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.260
And Tracy'll be glad
to have the help.

00:10.301 --> 00:13.346
- I have been hooking up
with Herrmann's niece.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.181
Herrmann's gonna murder me.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.767
- Can I start calling you Dad?

00:17.809 --> 00:20.020
- Yeah, Javi.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.021
- The adoption's going through.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.440
[all cheering]

00:23.481 --> 00:25.150
- This is Vin Martucci.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.695
He's hawking military weapons
on the streets of Chicago.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.988
Fortunately for us,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.698
Kavanagh's still willing
to negotiate.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.034
- The dirty cop who almost got
me and Stella killed?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.035
No way.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.286
- We don't do this deal,

00:36.327 --> 00:37.746
a lot of people
are gonna get hurt.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.414
And that's on you too.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.129
[soft pensive music]

00:46.171 --> 00:53.261
* *

01:01.144 --> 01:03.730
- Hey. Where you going?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.649
- I'm gonna get
a jump on the day--

01:06.691 --> 01:07.859
couldn't sleep.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.818
- Oh.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.239
So this is a thing, huh?

01:13.281 --> 01:15.450
- I don't know about a thing.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.040
- Did Pryma reach out
to you again?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.751
- I think I was pretty
clear about where I stood.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.712
- Yes, you were.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.174
But here you are out
the door at 4:00 a.m. again.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.638
Are you having second thoughts?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.639
- Are you?

01:39.974 --> 01:42.268
- I don't know.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.980
Kelly, if this Martucci guy
is as bad

01:46.022 --> 01:48.400
as Pryma says he is,

01:48.441 --> 01:51.027
and the Kavanagh deal
will help nail him--

01:51.069 --> 01:52.445
- We don't know that it will.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.159
If it doesn't,

01:58.201 --> 02:00.912
we're putting a dirty cop back
on the streets for nothing.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.456
- Yeah.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.794
There's no easy answers
on this one.

02:07.836 --> 02:14.050
* *

02:14.092 --> 02:15.593
- I'll see you
at the firehouse.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.474
- Javi, two minutes, papi.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.934
- He'll be out in a minute.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.979
He's fixing his hair
with a lot of mousse.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.647
- Ugh, why did no one warn us

02:27.689 --> 02:28.982
that the teenage years
started at ten?

02:29.024 --> 02:30.900
- [laughs]
[phone dings]

02:37.198 --> 02:39.868
- It's not the court date.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.036
Jeanie said it could take

02:41.077 --> 02:42.662
four to eight weeks
to get it scheduled.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.414
You did hear that part
of the conversation, right?

02:44.456 --> 02:46.666
- Right. Yes. I need to relax.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.085
- Yeah, we both know
that's not gonna happen.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.712
- [scoffs]

02:50.754 --> 02:52.881
- Maybe you should
put this energy

02:52.922 --> 02:55.508
into the adoption party.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.593
We need to order a cake.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.927
We got to figure out food.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.637
Javi still needs a new suit.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.475
You know, maybe you could get
one, too, while you're at it.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.314
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.940
- Tell me nothing's
gonna go wrong.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.985
- Nothing is gonna go wrong.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.821
[sentimental music]

03:16.863 --> 03:18.239
We're good.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.703
- Hey, Gallo, just the man
I wanted to see.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.207
Hey, I don't know if you heard,
but Tracy moved back home.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.209
She left yesterday.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.044
- No, uh--

03:31.086 --> 03:32.712
- She told me to say goodbye.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.422
I know you two,
you know, didn't spend

03:34.464 --> 03:37.384
a lot of time together,
but, hey,

03:37.425 --> 03:41.096
you must have made
a big impact on her.

03:41.137 --> 03:44.391
When my brother told me that
he was sending Tracy here,

03:44.432 --> 03:47.560
I was terrified that
she was gonna run amok,

03:47.602 --> 03:50.230
and he was gonna blame me.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.649
You know, but I'll be damned

03:52.691 --> 03:55.860
if she didn't actually
get her act together.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.280
And I will bet

03:59.322 --> 04:00.949
that it's because
she surrounded herself

04:00.990 --> 04:04.285
with good, solid people
like you, Gallo.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.039
So, hey, thank you.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.666
Really.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.334
- No--
[chuckles]

04:14.963 --> 04:17.257
- Uh...

04:17.298 --> 04:19.676
what the hell was that?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.428
- That was a great
and decent man

04:21.469 --> 04:23.471
pouring his heart out
to the jerk who's been

04:23.513 --> 04:25.849
lying to his face for months.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.935
I--yeah, I have to tell him.
I have to.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.854
- Whoa. Hey. Hey. Hey.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.063
Are you insane?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.440
- Yeah, don't be
an idiot, Gallo.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.608
There's nothing
to be gained from this.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.404
- Hey, look, if you guys
haven't noticed,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.072
I've had kind of a rough week.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.575
And it felt pretty damn good
to hear Herrmann tell me

04:43.616 --> 04:46.828
what a great person I am,
until I remembered I'm not.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.954
[alarm blares]

04:47.996 --> 04:51.041
- Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambo 61.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.001
Person trapped,
Loomis Street Bridge.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.546
[sirens wailing]

04:56.588 --> 04:59.507
[tense music]

04:59.549 --> 05:06.681
* *

05:14.647 --> 05:17.484
- Help, please!

05:17.525 --> 05:21.946
* *

05:27.660 --> 05:27.869
.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.037
- Cruz, rope bag and webbing.
- Yeah, on it.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.916
- Tony, Capp, let's get a
20-foot ladder over here now.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.001
- Let's tell the bridge tender
to lower the bridge.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.087
- No, not yet.
I need to get a closer look.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.340
Make sure the vibration
doesn't shake the bike loose.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.300
I'm going up the ped railing.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.843
We need to make sure
that bike is stabilized.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.513
If it comes down,
it's bringing the guy with it.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.932
- We can get the bike
with the aerial.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.351
You focus on the victim.
- Yeah, copy that.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.187
- 81, raise the aerial.
- On it.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.188
- Help!

05:55.230 --> 05:56.898
[tense music]

05:56.940 --> 05:58.149
- Hang on, bud.

05:58.191 --> 06:04.072
* *

06:04.114 --> 06:05.782
- Carver!
- Yeah.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.243
- Stand by at the bridge house.
- On it.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.453
- Capp, Tony, let's move.
- On it.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.001
- Hurry! Please!

06:21.089 --> 06:22.340
- Hey.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.591
You saw we got a guy
trapped up there?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.802
- That son of a bitch
ran the gate.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.721
- We're going up for him,
but I need you at the controls.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.472
Be ready to feather
the bridge on my order.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.807
- Negative,
I got an emergency protocol

06:30.849 --> 06:32.058
I got to follow--
can't do nothing

06:32.100 --> 06:33.476
till my supervisor gets here.
- Seriously?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.686
That man could
fall at any second.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.937
- I don't work for you, pal.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.230
I got to make sure
that bridge is stable

06:37.272 --> 06:39.065
or we got bigger problems
than that biker,

06:39.107 --> 06:40.692
who got himself into this mess,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.110
in case you didn't hear me
the first time.

06:42.152 --> 06:48.783
* *

06:56.332 --> 06:58.251
[metal creaking]

06:58.293 --> 07:00.378
- Hurry, please!

07:01.838 --> 07:03.340
- I'm coming!

07:08.303 --> 07:12.057
[machinery whirring]

07:13.850 --> 07:16.811
[wind whistling]

07:18.271 --> 07:19.981
- I can't hang on much longer.

07:20.023 --> 07:26.988
* *

07:56.184 --> 07:57.977
- All right, just nice
and easy, all right?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.729
Slow breaths.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.064
Gonna get you out of here.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.737
[metal groaning]

08:07.779 --> 08:09.906
- Hold, hold on!
- Oh, God, hurry!

08:11.199 --> 08:12.575
- Whoa!

08:12.617 --> 08:13.868
- Whoa!
- Oh, no.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.915
- Hey!

08:18.957 --> 08:21.042
Lower the bridge!

08:21.084 --> 08:23.503
- Lower the bridge!

08:23.545 --> 08:25.296
- I can't.
DOT has a strict policy.

08:25.338 --> 08:32.387
* *

08:42.480 --> 08:44.024
You are not
authorized to do that.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.117
- Hold the bridge!
- Hold the bridge!

08:57.203 --> 08:59.497
- All right, hey, let go.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.584
Come on. Stand up and go.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.044
I'm coming down, Cruz.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.420
- Copy that!

09:10.008 --> 09:11.384
All right, you're good now,
all right?

09:11.426 --> 09:12.677
One step at a time. You got it.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.264
All right, watch your step.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.891
Look over your left shoulder.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.145
Okay, now you put
your foot on the rung.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.646
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.647
You good?
- Yeah.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.940
- Now lean up.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.108
Ready?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.113
Come on.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.118
Good job.

09:45.043 --> 09:45.919
- Yo.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.921
I heard that bridge call was--

09:50.173 --> 09:51.341
Dude, no.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.884
- I have to.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.219
My conscience is killing me.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.428
I mean, look at him.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.056
He's such a decent man.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.104
- Hey, not now.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.730
Just trust me on this.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.399
He's my lieutenant.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.860
You got to pick your moments
when you give him bad news.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.781
Wait until
he's in a very good mood.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.533
- When is he ever
in a good mood?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.201
- Never. That's my point.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.661
- What the hell kind
of advice is that?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.162
- Hey, settle down.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.789
As you might have heard,

10:22.831 --> 10:24.708
the NFA are holding
their winter conference

10:24.749 --> 10:25.917
in Miami this year.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.502
- Oh!
- Oh, Miami, baby.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.129
- The conference is
right around the corner.

10:29.170 --> 10:34.342
We need to decide who is gonna
represent 51 by next shift.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.802
- I'll go, Chief.
- Whoa, I--

10:35.844 --> 10:39.139
- This year, we're gonna do it
by secret ballot.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.350
Anyone interested in tossing
their hat into the ring,

10:42.392 --> 10:43.727
let Kylie know.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.771
Oh yeah, don't vote
for yourselves, people.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.858
A seven-way tie completely
defeats the purpose.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.569
Okay. That'll be all.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.113
- Copy that.
- Thanks, Chief.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.449
[clears throat]
Me and Cindy,

10:57.490 --> 11:00.493
we have not been
on a real vacation

11:00.535 --> 11:02.078
in ten years.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.788
- I don't know what that has
to do anything with anything.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.540
- I haven't taken
a shower in two days.

11:05.582 --> 11:10.003
[overlapping arguing]

11:10.045 --> 11:12.339
- So you're not interested
in going to Miami, huh?

11:12.380 --> 11:15.550
- Uh, I did the winter
conference five years ago,

11:15.592 --> 11:18.178
so I guess, technically,
I'm eligible again.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.891
But if you must know,
Dylan invited me to go

11:22.932 --> 11:24.893
see the Killers that weekend.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.186
- Oh.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.729
An event date.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.023
Thought you were keeping
things in the slow lane.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.442
- Yeah, I know a concert
seems like a big move,

11:32.484 --> 11:35.028
but he got the tickets for free
from one of his regulars.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.529
And, of course,
I'm gonna suggest

11:36.571 --> 11:38.281
that we meet outside the venue,

11:38.323 --> 11:39.783
and you don't have to talk much
at a concert,

11:39.824 --> 11:44.079
so it's kind of the
perfect slow lane date.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.581
- Yeah, well, at least
you're not overthinking it.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.710
- Hey.
Carver, finish that later.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.796
Boden needs to see us.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.593
- Come on in, you two.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.929
Close the door and have a seat.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.683
[apprehensive music]

12:04.724 --> 12:07.894
So you want to tell me
what happened

12:07.936 --> 12:09.771
with the bridge tender today
on your call?

12:12.607 --> 12:15.735
- The guy refused to comply
with my directions, Chief.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.029
So I had to take
the controls myself.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.950
And there wasn't time
to be polite about it.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.661
- I was planning on noting it
in my incident report.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.663
It didn't seem like
a big thing to me, Chief.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.998
- Well, apparently,
the other guy disagrees.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.667
He's filed a formal complaint

12:30.709 --> 12:32.794
alleging a lot more
than impoliteness.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.340
He says Carver
put hands on him.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.928
- If Carver hadn't done it,

12:41.970 --> 12:44.389
you all would be having
this meeting without me.

12:48.143 --> 12:52.897
- Well, unfortunately,
it has moved beyond me now.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.316
Internal Affairs Division
is sending someone over today

12:55.358 --> 12:56.443
to take his statement.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.485
- Are you kidding me?

12:57.527 --> 12:59.029
IAD's involved already?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.697
- That's what happens
when a city employee

13:00.739 --> 13:03.116
files a complaint.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.161
- We saved the damn man's life.

13:06.202 --> 13:13.126
* *

13:16.629 --> 13:17.964
- Hey.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.758
Can you hold up a minute?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.509
- What's up?

13:21.551 --> 13:22.927
- I don't know. You tell me.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.138
What's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

13:25.180 --> 13:26.848
- You were pretty
fired up in there.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.850
You've been on edge for days.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.310
Look, I know the
whole Pryma thing

13:30.352 --> 13:32.103
really threw you for a loop.
- The Pryma thing is over.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.438
I'm done thinking about it.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.939
- Are you?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.192
It doesn't seem like it.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.986
It feels to me like
it's still weighing on you.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.239
And I know that I said there
are no easy answers there.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.200
I'm not sure
that's really true.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.079
I mean, if someone
is in trouble,

13:49.120 --> 13:51.915
you don't sit and ask
what happened and why.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.125
You get in there,
and you do whatever

13:54.167 --> 13:57.128
you got to do to help them,
right?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.005
That's what you did
on the bridge.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.716
That's just who you are.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.261
- But on a call, I have some
control over the situation.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.473
With Pryma and Kavanagh,
I got none.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.018
I'm totally at their mercy.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.979
- So talk to Pryma then.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.525
And maybe it's time
you took control of this thing.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.821
* *

14:27.701 --> 14:28.076
.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.035
- I'm looking
for Detective Pryma.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.164
Yeah, I did that already.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.166
Can you just tell him
Kelly Severide called?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.127
It's about the Martucci case.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.050
- I know, a tough call, right?

14:46.136 --> 14:48.013
I think I'm gonna go
with Herrmann.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.141
I mean, who else needs
a vacation as much as him?

14:51.182 --> 14:52.475
He's got five kids.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.186
And he runs Molly's,
which we all benefit from.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.355
The guy works like a beast.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.649
He probably hasn't had a good
night's sleep in ten years.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.026
- Hmm.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.610
That is a lot.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.780
- I bet this trip would make
him feel really appreciated.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.907
- Hmm.

15:07.949 --> 15:08.950
You know what?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.828
[soft playful music]

15:11.870 --> 15:18.835
* *

15:18.877 --> 15:20.253
- Seriously?

15:20.295 --> 15:21.713
- I'm trying to make amends.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.131
- You're harassing voters.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.175
- It's called campaigning.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.927
- It's called electioneering,
actually.

15:27.969 --> 15:28.887
- Potato, po-tah-to.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.055
- No.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.770
- Hey.

15:36.811 --> 15:37.937
I just want to make sure
you got

15:37.979 --> 15:39.647
all your ducks in a row
for IAD.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.524
- Don't worry, Lieutenant.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.777
I know how to clean it up
for the pencil pushers.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.946
- Well, I'm sure it's fine.

15:46.988 --> 15:50.367
It's the interview
you need to worry about.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.411
You got to be ready for this
guy to push your buttons,

15:53.453 --> 15:55.038
to see if you
change your story,

15:55.080 --> 15:58.500
or worse, lose your temper.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.126
- Me? Never.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.629
[apprehensive music]

16:02.671 --> 16:05.006
- Look, rumor has it
you can be charming

16:05.048 --> 16:07.717
when you want to be, Carver.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.135
So charm this guy.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.262
Kiss his ass a little
if you have to.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.182
Just don't screw this up.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.726
We need you here--

16:16.768 --> 16:18.812
to make us all feel better
about our drinking habits.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.022
- [chuckles]

16:21.064 --> 16:23.066
- All right?

16:23.108 --> 16:25.026
- We've come a long way, huh?

16:25.068 --> 16:27.404
You actually seem
concerned about me.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.572
- Hell, yeah, I am concerned.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.951
Listen,
these low-level IAD people,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.619
they're not just
pencil pushers.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.287
They can refer things
up the chain,

16:36.329 --> 16:39.082
turn this into a
full-blown investigation.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.752
Then all bets are off.

16:42.794 --> 16:49.009
* *

16:49.050 --> 16:51.428
- Plus, he was your best man.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.097
And when the arrow
was malfunctioning,

16:54.139 --> 16:55.181
you were getting blamed.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.891
Who saved your ass on that?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.018
Herrmann.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.853
- You make a solid case, Gallo.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.230
I'll give you that--
very persuasive.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.649
Have you ever considered
running for union rep?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.818
- So do you think
you'll vote for him?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.361
- Oh, no.
I already voted.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.988
- What? For who?
- Myself.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.115
- That's against the rules.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.908
- I think it was more
of a suggestion.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.035
- It was literally
the only rule.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.745
- Yes!

17:16.786 --> 17:18.079
I just got the call.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.081
It's official.
It's really happening.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.208
- What's happening?
- The adoption ceremony.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.127
We thought that it
was gonna take months

17:24.169 --> 17:26.254
to get the court date,
but no, it's next shift.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.630
- Nice.
- That's great news, Joe.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.675
- And, uh,
the big adoption party?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.719
- Oh, man, uh, I don't know.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.471
We don't have any time
to plan anything.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.638
I guess we're gonna have
to do it down the line.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.475
I--you know what?
It doesn't matter.

17:38.516 --> 17:43.104
The important thing is,
it's really happening.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.607
- Whoo.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.984
- Oh, uh, boss,
I'm gonna need next shift off.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.861
- Got you covered.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.029
- Whoo! Thank you.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.375
- What's so urgent, Lieutenant?

18:03.416 --> 18:06.294
- I want to talk to him,
face to face.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.046
- To who?
- Kavanagh.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.006
- What the hell for?
No, that's--

18:10.048 --> 18:12.884
- I need to look him in the eye
before I agree to let him walk.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.011
- Look, handling informants
is a delicate business.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.262
All right, you go at them
the wrong way,

18:16.304 --> 18:18.056
you could spook them,
make them clam up.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.182
You could blow
the whole Martucci--

18:19.224 --> 18:22.519
- You let me talk to him
or I'm out.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.733
- Two months--I'll cover
your shifts at Molly's

18:28.775 --> 18:30.443
for two months,
at any time, for any reason,

18:30.485 --> 18:33.613
at a moment's notice,
no questions asked.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.116
All right, three months.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.035
- Gallo, why the hell
do you care so much

18:39.077 --> 18:40.453
if Herrmann wins this thing?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.330
- Why do I care?
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.707
- Why wouldn't I care?

18:43.748 --> 18:47.002
Herrmann's--
he's like a father to me.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.211
- Since when?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.547
- Lieutenant,
we might have a problem.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.508
IAD's here
in the briefing room.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.301
- Okay.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.553
You let Carver know?

18:56.594 --> 18:59.347
- He's on his way,
but I think

18:59.389 --> 19:02.767
you're gonna want to see this.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.060
- Okay.

19:04.102 --> 19:07.022
[suspenseful music]

19:19.951 --> 19:20.326

19:20.368 --> 19:21.661
- But I assure you, if there
was any physical contact,

19:23.913 --> 19:24.956
it was totally incidental.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.916
[tense music]

19:26.958 --> 19:28.543
- Incidental?

19:28.585 --> 19:31.254
And what does
incidental mean to you?

19:31.296 --> 19:33.423
- Unintentional, I guess.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.883
- So there was contact then?

19:34.924 --> 19:37.635
- I mean, it was sort of a--

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
it was a gesture
as much as anything,

19:39.721 --> 19:41.473
like get out of the way.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.766
- I assume you know there are

19:42.807 --> 19:46.019
security cameras
all over that bridge?

19:46.061 --> 19:49.439
So was there any contact?

19:49.481 --> 19:53.234
- Like I said, there might
have been slight contact,

19:53.276 --> 19:54.944
but it was incidental.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.238
- Is that it?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.366
- Yes.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.951
Actually, no,
I just want to say that

20:01.993 --> 20:04.662
we saved that biker's life.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.664
I hope that gets
factored into this.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.335
- How'd you end up at 51?

20:12.212 --> 20:14.172
- Oh, uh,
Chief Boden recommended me.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.509
- The Deputy District Chief.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.596
That's quite the endorsement.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.642
- Yeah, I guess.
Is this a part of--

20:25.684 --> 20:27.227
- And, uh,
how are you liking it here?

20:27.268 --> 20:31.022
I know 51 isn't always the
most welcoming with new people.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.817
It can be a little...

20:33.858 --> 20:38.363
I don't want to say cliquey,
but, well, cliquey.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.825
Has that been your experience?

20:41.866 --> 20:48.832

20:52.419 --> 20:53.837
- I just don't get
how someone could flame out

20:53.878 --> 20:56.381
as badly as her
and still end up in IAD.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.674
- Well, at least
we know she can't

20:57.716 --> 20:59.426
hide her true colors for long.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.219
IAD will figure it out
sooner or later.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.387
- Yeah, but what kind of damage

21:02.429 --> 21:04.556
is she gonna do
in the meantime?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.683
That's what I worry about.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.852
- I swear to God, I am gonna
claw that bitch's eyes out

21:08.893 --> 21:10.437
if she thinks that
she can just come back and--

21:10.478 --> 21:13.773
- I know that it's hard,
but we cannot confront her now.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.358
It can only make things worse
for Carver.

[door clicks open]

21:16.943 --> 21:23.908

21:27.078 --> 21:28.288

21:28.329 --> 21:29.581
- Is she gonna
recommend charges?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.541
- Uh, she said
we'd know by next shift.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.543
Did she used to work here
or something?

21:33.585 --> 21:35.962
- Yeah, when I was gone
last spring.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.589
- That explains a lot.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.425
I got the feeling that
she has a little baggage here.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.510
- Oh, there's
a whole luggage rack.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.726
- She tried
to blackmail Hawkins...

21:52.103 --> 21:53.271
And get Violet fired.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.606
- Almost pulled it off too.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.733
- Yeah, until she totally
disgraced herself

21:56.775 --> 21:58.443
in the line of duty
and got transferred out.

21:58.485 --> 22:01.321
We all figured she'd be
riding a desk somewhere.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.739
None of us would have thought--

22:02.781 --> 22:04.991
- That this sociopath
would wind up in a position

22:05.033 --> 22:06.618
to end my career?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.707
- What about Uncle Leon?

22:12.749 --> 22:15.752
- Oh, he was named
after our grandfather,

22:15.794 --> 22:19.714
who is your great grandfather
now, Abuelito Leonel.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.049
- He's one who played baseball.

22:21.091 --> 22:23.134
- Yeah, but he didn't
just play baseball.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.552
He was a legend.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.596
He pitched
for the Tigres del Licey

22:26.638 --> 22:28.556
when they won
the Pro Dominican title.

22:28.598 --> 22:29.891
But then he tore
his rotator cuff,

22:29.933 --> 22:32.185
and that was the end
of his career.

22:32.227 --> 22:33.937
- That's so sad.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.480
- Ah, it's a, you know,
blessing in disguise,

22:35.522 --> 22:36.648
if you think about it.

22:36.690 --> 22:37.941
If he hadn't gotten injured,

22:37.982 --> 22:40.360
he never would have
met my grandmother.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.362
And I wouldn't be here
right now.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.072
- And neither would I.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.536
- What about this one?

22:49.577 --> 22:53.415
[soft sentimental music]

22:53.456 --> 22:55.458
- Oh. [chuckles]

22:55.500 --> 22:57.961
That's--that's nice.

22:58.003 --> 23:01.798
But, listen to me, Javi,
you are a Cruz now.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.551
And Cruzes are known
for three things--

23:04.592 --> 23:06.678
food, baseball,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.304
and a lot of people
don't know this,

23:08.346 --> 23:10.890
but a great sense of style.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.351
- Mm.
- Mm, ah!

23:15.395 --> 23:17.313
Mm? How about that?

23:17.355 --> 23:18.815
Pretty snazzy, right?

23:18.857 --> 23:22.152
Hey, the pinstripe,
it's timeless.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.486
- It's nice.

23:23.528 --> 23:27.657
* *

23:32.829 --> 23:34.664
- I'm telling you now,
this better not be

23:34.706 --> 23:36.541
some revenge fantasy you're
looking to play out here.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.709
- Just let me in.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.518
- So?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.104
- Did Pryma tell you who I am?

24:08.281 --> 24:10.992
Did you know what Campbell
was planning on doing

24:11.034 --> 24:12.911
with the information
you slipped him?

24:15.330 --> 24:17.207
On my wedding night?

24:17.248 --> 24:19.084
- Not exactly.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.710
[scoffs]

24:20.752 --> 24:24.047
Did I think he was looking
to take you out for a drink?

24:24.089 --> 24:25.715
No, of course, not.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.176
To be honest with you,

24:28.218 --> 24:31.221
I didn't give a rat's ass what
he did with the information,

24:31.262 --> 24:34.182
as long as he paid me.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.892
I'm not saying that's right.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.977
I'm not saying
I feel good about it.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.939
[tense music]

24:40.980 --> 24:43.233
* *

24:43.274 --> 24:44.526
- He almost killed my wife.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.112
- I know.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.156
What can I say?

24:50.198 --> 24:52.826
I betrayed my oath as a cop.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.954
I dishonored myself, my family,

24:55.995 --> 24:59.290
for a little bit
of pocket change,

24:59.332 --> 25:01.292
is what it was in the end.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.878
And I got to live with that
for the rest of my life.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.882
So whatever you
came here to say...

25:07.924 --> 25:09.884
it ain't gonna be any worse
than that, pal.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.681
- Nice speech.

25:16.975 --> 25:20.145
Now I get how
you almost convinced Pryma.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.941
- What the hell did you
even come here for?

25:24.983 --> 25:26.818
- To see if you were
really the linchpin

25:26.860 --> 25:29.446
to the Martucci investigation.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.573
And I ain't buying it.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.742
- Come on, man.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.827
You're--you're gonna send
a cop to prison?

25:35.869 --> 25:37.454
I mean, you know
what that means.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.289
- I do.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.417
That's why I think you'd
say anything to avoid it.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.336
Pryma!

25:44.377 --> 25:47.047
Hey, get me out of here.
I'm done with this guy.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.135
This was a mistake.

25:52.177 --> 25:54.679
- Hey, Martucci knows
you're gonna bug his cell.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.892
He's planning
a decoy operation.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.272
- There you go.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.565
Make your deal now.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.154
- What is that?
- Unofficial polling.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.823
I think I have four solid
votes for Herrmann--

26:13.865 --> 26:16.493
you, me, Brett, and Violet.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.827
Severide and Cruz
won't talk to me,

26:17.869 --> 26:19.954
but they're gonna vote
for Capp or Tony, right?

26:19.996 --> 26:22.040
Mouch is the one
I'm worried about.

26:22.082 --> 26:27.712
He could have Kidd, Carver,
Herrmann, and himself.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.964
Man, this is coming
right down to the wire.

26:30.006 --> 26:33.760
- Dude, this election is
really stressing you out.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.637
- I know. I know. I'm crazy.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.973
But I just--
I just got to do this, okay?

26:41.893 --> 26:44.145
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.563
- Hey, what are you
guys drinking?

26:45.605 --> 26:46.856
- If this is about
the election,

26:46.898 --> 26:48.525
me and Tony agreed
to vote for each other.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.860
- We got a system.
- All right, look.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.362
You have no idea
what I'm up against here.

26:52.404 --> 26:53.905
I'm not exaggerating when I say

26:53.947 --> 26:56.574
this is
a life-or-death situation.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.701
No, I'm serious.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.661
If Herrmann doesn't win this--

26:59.703 --> 27:01.579
I can't get into
the whole thing,

27:01.621 --> 27:03.206
but bottom line,
I'm a dead man.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.874
- That's a shame, Gallo.
- Been nice knowing you.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.126
- This is not a joke.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.252
- Someone call dibs
on your locker?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.713
- Okay. What do you want?

27:09.754 --> 27:10.755
Do you want me to beg?
I'll beg.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.173
- Come on, Gallo.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.342
We're talking a free trip
to Miami in January.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.136
- Beers for a month.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.303
- Yeah.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.055
All you can drink, on me.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.307
- We've been doing
some unofficial polling,

27:21.349 --> 27:24.185
and uh, I'd take the bird
in the hand if I were you.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.731
- Right.

27:27.772 --> 27:31.568
[indistinct whispering]

27:31.609 --> 27:34.571
- Okay. Herrmann it is.

27:34.612 --> 27:35.864
- Thank you, gentlemen.

27:42.037 --> 27:44.164
- Oh.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.751
I see we're double-fisting,
as usual.

27:47.792 --> 27:51.671
- One's for you, actually.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.839
Mind if I sit?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.427
- You all right?

27:57.469 --> 27:59.429
- Yeah.

27:59.471 --> 28:00.805
I just, you know...

28:03.224 --> 28:06.311
Wanted to say thanks
for having my back.

28:07.562 --> 28:08.897
And not just on this IAD thing,

28:08.938 --> 28:11.524
but no matter how
this all shakes out.

28:11.566 --> 28:13.401
- Oh, come on, Carver.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.820
It's not time
for the goodbye speech yet.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.281
- Yeah, well,

28:18.323 --> 28:22.660
with 51's arch-nemesis
on my case,

28:22.702 --> 28:24.412
it doesn't feel
so far away, either.

28:24.454 --> 28:27.374
[soft melancholic music]

28:27.415 --> 28:34.297
* *

28:42.097 --> 28:42.305
.

28:42.347 --> 28:42.764
- What's this?

28:44.391 --> 28:45.684
Nope.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.102
It's in here somewhere.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.650
Okay.

28:53.692 --> 28:55.026
Here we go.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.612
So I've had the opportunity
to review

28:57.654 --> 29:00.615
all of the case materials,
statements, incident reports,

29:00.657 --> 29:03.410
and security footage
from the bridge.

29:03.451 --> 29:06.830
And the bottom line is,

29:06.871 --> 29:08.039
I don't see sufficient cause

29:08.081 --> 29:09.874
to recommend
disciplinary action

29:09.916 --> 29:12.419
or to refer the matter
to any other agency.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.170
- I'm glad to hear that.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.381
- Just so I'm extra clear--

29:16.423 --> 29:18.425
- As long as you agree
to send the bridge tender

29:18.466 --> 29:21.344
a written apology
and 51 pays for the door,

29:21.386 --> 29:26.099
then I'm comfortable closing
the book on this matter.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.064
Any questions?

29:33.106 --> 29:34.941
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, then.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.361
This has been fun.

29:40.530 --> 29:41.448
All right.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.243
- Thank you.
- Of course.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.328
And um, just a word of advice,
you should be

29:47.370 --> 29:50.331
a little more mindful
of your temper moving forward.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.959
One incident like this in your
personnel file is a bad day.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.086
Two can really start
to look like a pattern.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.757
- Understood.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.718
[tense music]

30:01.760 --> 30:05.722
* *

30:05.764 --> 30:06.973
- Hey.

30:09.726 --> 30:13.021
Hey, just so you know,
um, your friend Carver,

30:13.063 --> 30:14.397
he's in the clear.

30:14.439 --> 30:15.523
It's all good.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.400
I'm sure you guys
were worried about it,

30:17.442 --> 30:18.777
but I'm just happy
that I was in a position

30:18.818 --> 30:20.362
to help 51 on this one.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.449
Okay, then. Bye, girl.

30:24.491 --> 30:26.117
- Hey.
- Huh?

30:26.159 --> 30:28.411
- Don't pretend like
you just did 51 a favor.

30:28.453 --> 30:29.996
We know you.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.332
And you may have
IAD fooled for now,

30:32.374 --> 30:34.626
but we know exactly
who you are.

30:34.668 --> 30:38.463
- Okay, Violet, relax.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.299
All I'm saying is that

30:41.341 --> 30:45.136
it's not the worst thing
to have a friend in IAD.

30:45.178 --> 30:47.889
You never know
when it might come in handy.

30:47.931 --> 30:55.021
* *

30:58.400 --> 31:01.736
- And did Pryma say when
they plan to move on Martucci?

31:01.778 --> 31:02.821
- I didn't ask.
He didn't tell.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.948
But whatever happens, um,

31:04.989 --> 31:06.449
I'm fine putting it
in the rearview.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.118
- Yeah, me too.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.869
- Okay, people, gather around.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.955
It is the moment of truth.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.581
- Uh, I just have to say,

31:13.623 --> 31:15.875
given the lax election security
on display here,

31:15.917 --> 31:17.502
I think we should all be

31:17.544 --> 31:20.839
a little skeptical
of these results.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.549
- Okay.

31:25.176 --> 31:27.012
It's a landslide, people.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.473
And the person representing 51

31:30.515 --> 31:32.892
at the NFA
winter conference will be...

31:35.020 --> 31:36.146
Christopher Herrmann.

31:36.187 --> 31:38.898
- Oh!
- Whoo!

31:38.940 --> 31:39.983
Congratulations, Herrmann.

31:40.025 --> 31:44.529
[applause]

31:44.571 --> 31:45.905
- Good on you.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.449
- You deserve it, Herrmann.

31:47.490 --> 31:48.283
- I really do.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.493
[soft sentimental music]

31:50.535 --> 31:51.745
- Congratulations.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.121
No one deserves this more.

31:53.163 --> 31:56.374
I mean, you're such
a great guy, the best.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.544
Which is why
it's so hard for me

31:59.586 --> 32:00.587
to say this to you.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.339
- Miami of Ohio?

32:04.716 --> 32:07.761
You didn't say Miami of Ohio.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.012
You never said that.

32:09.054 --> 32:10.221
- Pretty sure I did.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.643
- I know what this is.
It's a con.

32:15.685 --> 32:16.770
I got conned.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.813
Classic--
the old bait and switch.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.691
Huh? Who else is in on this?

32:21.733 --> 32:23.151
Mouch, you were in on it?

32:23.193 --> 32:25.945
All right, hey,
did you know, too, huh?

32:25.987 --> 32:27.238
Is this what you were
about to tell me?

32:27.280 --> 32:28.406
- No, I didn't know.
- Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.618
- Okay, peo--okay!
The election is over.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.036
Time to turn the page.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.662
We have much more
important things to attend to.

32:34.704 --> 32:40.001
Now, I was able
to buy just enough time.

32:40.043 --> 32:42.921
All units out of service
for the next 30 minutes.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.339
Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.968
- This isn't over yet.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.763
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this!

32:51.805 --> 32:53.139
- You were right.

32:53.181 --> 32:54.933
He's literally never
in a good mood.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.644
- Of all my duties that I'm
responsible for as an officer

32:57.686 --> 33:00.146
of this court,
none gives me more joy

33:00.188 --> 33:02.649
or feels more important
than when I have the honor

33:02.691 --> 33:05.735
to unite a child,
legally and irrevocably,

33:05.777 --> 33:07.445
to his forever family.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.240
And it gives me extra comfort
to see that, in this case,

33:10.281 --> 33:13.910
it would seem, family means
more than mom and dad.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.870
It's a cliché,
but I do sincerely

33:15.912 --> 33:17.288
believe it takes a village.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.124
So thank you all
for being here.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.042
- Wouldn't miss it
for the world, Your Honor.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.961
[cheering]

33:23.003 --> 33:24.129
- Cruz!

33:24.170 --> 33:26.172
- Not yet. Almost.

33:26.214 --> 33:31.177
Mom and Dad, let's have you
sign and date here,

33:31.219 --> 33:35.515
which says that you are now
legally, financially,

33:35.557 --> 33:38.268
and emotionally responsible
for this young man

33:38.309 --> 33:41.146
exactly as if he were
your natural-born child.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.107
[sentimental music]

33:44.149 --> 33:48.987
* *

33:49.029 --> 33:51.239
And that's it.

33:51.281 --> 33:54.034
It's my honor to announce
that you will be known

33:54.075 --> 33:56.369
from this day forward
by the legal name

33:56.411 --> 33:59.831
Javier Alejandro Cruz.

33:59.873 --> 34:03.752
[all cheering]

34:03.793 --> 34:10.633
* *

34:12.218 --> 34:13.845
- Welcome to the family, papi.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.805
- Mr. Cruz.

34:15.847 --> 34:18.391
- Chief Boden.
- [laughs]

34:22.812 --> 34:24.689
- Hey, Herrmann.

34:24.731 --> 34:25.690
- Hey.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.776
Isn't this beautiful?

34:27.817 --> 34:30.028
It's family.

34:30.070 --> 34:34.366
It is really
the most important thing.

34:34.407 --> 34:37.744
- It is. It really, really is.

34:37.786 --> 34:41.623
Herrmann, by the way,
I slept with your niece.

34:41.664 --> 34:42.707
- What?

34:42.749 --> 34:44.626
- I slept with Tracy.
I'm sorry.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.086
[radio crackles]

34:46.127 --> 34:47.712
- Main to Truck 81,
Ambo 61.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.714
Police assist
at 827 West Bishop.

34:49.756 --> 34:51.925
They have
a barricaded suspect.

34:51.966 --> 34:56.346
[sirens wailing]

34:56.388 --> 34:58.765
[tense music]

34:58.807 --> 35:00.558
- Whoa.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.061
- All this for one
barricaded suspect?

35:03.103 --> 35:10.235
* *

35:21.496 --> 35:22.247
- Hey.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.540
What's going on?

35:23.581 --> 35:25.083
- That's above my pay grade,

35:25.125 --> 35:26.334
but it's got to be
something major.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.794
I've never seen
anything like this.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.714
- You have 30 more seconds.
Come out.

35:30.755 --> 35:32.007
This doesn't get
any better for you

35:32.048 --> 35:33.425
if anyone gets hurt, Martucci.

35:36.219 --> 35:38.555
- You ever been
to anything like this?

35:38.596 --> 35:39.556
- Nope.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.059
- Kelly, it's Martucci.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.894
Yeah,
they're taking him down now.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.187
- What? Pryma's there?

35:46.229 --> 35:47.856
- Yeah.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.524
It's a huge operation.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.735
- On my way.
- Copy.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.486
- Time's up, Martucci.
We're coming in.

35:53.528 --> 35:54.946
- Shh. Tuck in tight.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.948
Come on.

35:56.990 --> 35:59.826
[gunfire]

35:59.868 --> 36:06.708
* *

36:15.467 --> 36:15.633
.

36:15.675 --> 36:15.967
[gunfire]

36:18.595 --> 36:20.388
- Prepare to breach.

36:20.430 --> 36:23.391
[tense music]

36:23.433 --> 36:30.398
* *

36:39.407 --> 36:42.035
[projectile streaking]
- Incoming!

36:42.077 --> 36:45.872
[officers shouting]

36:45.914 --> 36:47.248
- And we're clear!

36:47.290 --> 36:50.043
We're clear!

36:50.085 --> 36:51.586
- Medic!
- We need the medic!

36:51.628 --> 36:52.921
- They're calling
for a medic up there.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.756
- Let's go. Stay low.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.007
Stay alert.

36:56.049 --> 37:02.972
* *

37:17.654 --> 37:18.988
- Come on. Let's go.
Let's move it.

37:25.412 --> 37:27.622
- All clear.
Medics, over here.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.127
Where the hell
is my Bomb Squad?

37:32.168 --> 37:33.712
- What's going on?

37:33.753 --> 37:35.130
- Thing's still in his leg.
It didn't detonate.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.381
I don't know how.

37:36.423 --> 37:37.590
- What's in his--

37:37.632 --> 37:39.968
- Rocket propelled grenade.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.804
- Is it Pryma?

37:42.846 --> 37:44.597
- He's bleeding like
a stuck pig in there.

37:44.639 --> 37:46.266
And we can't move him--
we could set off the grenade

37:46.307 --> 37:48.476
and level the whole damn house.
- So what's the plan?

37:48.518 --> 37:50.103
- I'm sending in
the Bomb Squad to deal

37:50.145 --> 37:51.563
with the unexploded ordnance.

37:51.604 --> 37:54.232
But Pryma needs
medical attention immediately.

37:54.274 --> 37:56.151
We need get two of you suited
up and in there right now.

37:56.192 --> 37:58.153
- I'll go. I'll do it.
- Let me go, Lieutenant.

37:58.194 --> 38:00.280
It should always be
the oldest in this situation.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.699
- Ma'am?

38:02.741 --> 38:05.243
- Okay. It's me and...

38:05.285 --> 38:07.495
- I know how to start an IV,
apply a tourniquet, just--

38:07.537 --> 38:08.872
- Okay, Carver, you're with me.

38:08.913 --> 38:10.623
The rest of you stand by
for search and rescue,

38:10.665 --> 38:12.876
in case things
don't go our way.

38:12.917 --> 38:17.756
* *

38:17.797 --> 38:19.591
- All right, when you
fix the tourniquet,

38:19.632 --> 38:21.760
run the fluid wide open.

38:21.801 --> 38:23.219
- Copy.

38:23.261 --> 38:27.057
[sirens wailing]

38:29.267 --> 38:30.894
- T, right here.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.201
- Hey. What's happening?

38:46.242 --> 38:48.370
Where's Stella?

38:48.411 --> 38:49.579
What is it? Where is she?

38:49.621 --> 38:56.753
* *

39:00.632 --> 39:02.384
- Stay behind me.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.761
Step where I step.

39:16.981 --> 39:19.901
[Pryma groans]

39:19.943 --> 39:22.404
- Get the hell out
of here, Lieutenant.

39:22.445 --> 39:24.155
You don't need to be here.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.536
- We're not going anywhere.

39:31.579 --> 39:33.456
All right.

39:37.711 --> 39:40.255
- Sorry.
- We are getting out of this.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.215
All right?
- [groaning]

39:45.301 --> 39:46.845
- Chief's here.

39:46.886 --> 39:48.638
- Chief.
- My guys are inside, right?

39:48.680 --> 39:50.473
- Yeah, two of yours,
one Bomb Squad.

39:50.515 --> 39:52.183
- Why--why didn't it
explode on impact?

39:52.225 --> 39:53.852
- It has an arming range
of 5 to 10 meters.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.603
It was fired in close quarters.
- So it didn't arm itself?

39:55.645 --> 39:57.272
- Not yet--
but moving it could trigger

39:57.313 --> 39:59.774
a self-destruct action
within five seconds.

40:02.610 --> 40:04.404
- Pushing saline.
- Here.

40:04.446 --> 40:05.947
- Screw this. I'm going in.
- Oh, the hell you are.

40:05.989 --> 40:08.616
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Severide, stand down!

40:08.658 --> 40:10.076
- We're sitting
on our hands here.

40:10.118 --> 40:10.994
- I said stand down.

40:13.163 --> 40:15.290
- Here. Hold this.

40:15.331 --> 40:22.255
* *

40:26.593 --> 40:28.053
- You got it.

40:28.094 --> 40:29.095
- Stop moving.

40:29.137 --> 40:30.764
Stop moving.

40:30.805 --> 40:32.182
- Doing my best, Ed.

40:32.223 --> 40:34.059
- He's losing too much blood.
We got to speed this up.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.435
- Any sudden movement
could arm the warhead

40:35.477 --> 40:37.145
and cause it to self detonate.

40:37.187 --> 40:44.110
* *

40:50.450 --> 40:51.868
That's the last piece.

40:51.910 --> 40:54.079
- All right, get the gauze
ready and the scissors.

40:57.999 --> 40:59.959
His pressure's dropping.
We're losing him.

41:00.001 --> 41:01.378
- Okay, Seth, hold him still.

41:01.419 --> 41:04.130
On three, two, one.

41:04.172 --> 41:05.632
- [groans]

41:05.674 --> 41:08.426
- We got you.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.387
- Coming out with the ordnance.

41:10.428 --> 41:11.680
[click, electronic humming]

41:11.721 --> 41:13.473
- Take cover!
- Cover him!

41:13.515 --> 41:20.730
* *

41:21.189 --> 41:23.900
[officers shouting]

41:30.824 --> 41:33.785
[dramatic music]

41:33.827 --> 41:40.959
* *

42:01.104 --> 42:04.024
[wolf howls]
