{\an1}AMANDA, IT'S NOT REALLY

19:59.323 --> 20:00.324
{\an1}MY PLACE TO SAY,

20:00.407 --> 20:01.867
{\an1}BUT MAYBE YOU'RE PICKING

20:01.950 --> 20:02.951
{\an1}THE WRONG GUYS.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.038
{\an1}I MEAN, MY DAD WOULD NEVER LIE.

20:06.121 --> 20:06.705
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU TRYING TO FIX ME UP

20:06.788 --> 20:07.164
{\an1}WITH YOUR FATHER?

20:07.247 --> 20:07.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GROSS.

20:08.081 --> 20:12.961
{\an1}NO.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.129
{\an1}I'M JUST SAYING

20:14.212 --> 20:18.592
{\an1}YOU DESERVE BETTER.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.303
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.763
{\an1}JUST SO HARD TO FIND A MAN

20:22.846 --> 20:23.931
{\an1}WHO DRIVES A NICE CAR,

20:24.014 --> 20:24.598
{\an1}KNOWS HOW TO DRESS,

20:24.681 --> 20:27.309
{\an1}AND MAKES A LOT OF MONEY.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.143
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO CARES?

20:28.226 --> 20:30.395
{\an1}I MEAN, MY DAD MAY NOT HAVE MUCH

20:30.479 --> 20:32.981
{\an1}BUT HE'S THE BEST.

20:33.065 --> 20:33.357
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK

20:33.440 --> 20:33.941
{\an1}WE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.778
{\an1}I'M NOT INTERESTED.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.737
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT WANNA LEAVE

20:38.820 --> 20:41.031
{\an1}BEFORE I CALL CHAD.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.157
{\an1}I'M GONNA BE USING SEVERAL WORDS

20:42.240 --> 20:46.286
{\an1}THAT AREN'T IN YOUR VOCABULARY.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I PROBABLY SHOULD.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.415
{\an1}I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT STARTED

20:50.499 --> 20:50.832
{\an1}ON MY SUPER SECRET

20:50.916 --> 20:56.463
{\an1}CHOCOLATE PUDDING PIE.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.464
{\an1}AMANDA, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME

20:57.547 --> 21:00.259
{\an1}TO MY HOUSE FOR DINNER?

21:00.342 --> 21:03.512
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK NOT.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.513
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT SIT ALONE

21:04.596 --> 21:05.472
{\an1}IN AN EMPTY OFFICE

21:05.555 --> 21:06.223
{\an1}WHILE THERE'S A HOMEMADE PIECE

21:06.306 --> 21:07.099
{\an1}WAITING FOR YOU.

21:07.182 --> 21:07.849
{\an1}DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL MY MOMMA

21:07.933 --> 21:09.142
{\an1}'CAUSE SHE'LL COME DOWN HERE?

21:09.226 --> 21:09.518
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, REALLY--

21:09.601 --> 21:13.021
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HI, MOM.

21:13.105 --> 21:13.605
{\an1}WE'LL BE HAVING ONE MORE

21:13.689 --> 21:22.906
{\an1}FOR DINNER.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.323
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, "SPOOKY"

21:23.407 --> 21:25.033
{\an1}WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

21:25.117 --> 21:25.409
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, DON'T SAY

21:25.492 --> 21:26.159
{\an1}I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

21:26.243 --> 21:26.952
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I MAY GO AGAIN TOMORROW.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.370
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'LL COME TOO.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.123
{\an1}MAN, I HATE THAT MOVIE.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.416
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE WAS RIGHT.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.793
{\an1}HER DAD IS PRETTY GREAT.

21:34.876 --> 21:35.335
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.254
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PUDDING PIE.

21:37.337 --> 21:40.298
{\an1}IT'S MY THIRD PIECE.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.134
{\an1}SORT OF EARTHY,

21:42.217 --> 21:44.302
{\an1}LIKE A CHOCOLATE SWAMP.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.095
{\an1}IT'S ALSO MAKING MY GUMS

21:45.178 --> 21:46.346
{\an1}FEEL FUNNY,

21:46.430 --> 21:48.640
{\an1}AND A BUZZING SOUND IN MY EAR.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.683
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UH-OH.

21:49.766 --> 21:49.891
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

21:49.975 --> 21:50.809
{\an1}WHAT?

21:50.892 --> 21:51.518
{\an1}WHAT IS IT?

21:51.601 --> 21:51.727
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK,

21:51.810 --> 21:52.269
{\an1}TRUE IS OUR BEST FRIEND.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.021
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.

21:54.104 --> 21:54.438
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EXCEPT COOKING.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.772
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY PIE.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.524
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT EVERYONE'S EATING IT.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.400
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, JUST PRETENDING.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.109
{\an1}NO ONE WANTS TO HURT

21:59.192 --> 22:00.193
{\an1}HER FEELINGS.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.154
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO WANTS MORE PUDDING PIE?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.155
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DO.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.407
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW IT.

22:05.490 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}OH.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.915
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA,

22:13.999 --> 22:15.667
{\an1}I KNOW YOU'RE UP THERE.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.419
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CHAD?

22:17.502 --> 22:19.379
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW DID HE FIND HER HERE?

22:19.463 --> 22:22.340
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SPY.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.844
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UH-OH.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.680
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, NO ONE THROWS UP ON ME,

22:28.764 --> 22:32.350
{\an1}I'M CHAD BRACKETT.
