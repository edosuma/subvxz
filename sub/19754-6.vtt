00:30.464 --> 00:31.899
Hey! Look out!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.717
Drags you down in the morning...

00:50.718 --> 00:52.985
That ravenous hole
in your heart.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.122
Is it loneliness? Is it sadness?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.923
Is it lust?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.525
Jesus said, "Blessed are those"

00:58.526 --> 01:01.161
"who hunger and thirst
for righteousness,

01:01.162 --> 01:02.862
for they shall be satisfied."

01:02.863 --> 01:04.497
When you find Jesus,

01:04.498 --> 01:06.933
Those empty places inside you

01:06.934 --> 01:09.136
will be filled with His love.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.572
You will never be hungry again.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.507
Welcome, brother.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.508
Are you hungry
for piece of mind?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.844
Can we help you find
what you're looking for?

01:17.845 --> 01:19.045
I think so.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.813
Are you Paul Curtis?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.249
In the humble flesh.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.352
Thanks, Reverend.
You've been served.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.589
Hallelujah!

01:35.829 --> 01:37.564
You got to be kidding me.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.399
Randy Wilkins.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.502
Give me that, you little shit!

01:43.537 --> 01:45.638
- DWP meeting is at 4.
- Yeah.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.073
So you're gonna have
to really hustle

01:47.074 --> 01:48.475
to the school board
meeting right after.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.643
No, no, no. Absolute...
Nix the school board.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.212
I have dinner plans.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.980
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.682
And what are you hungry for?

01:55.683 --> 01:59.252
I have an appetite...
I was thinking steak.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.654
Might want to change that.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.190
All those protests
at Harris High

02:03.191 --> 02:04.557
are making Vasquez jumpy.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.593
She's going to force a vote
on a name change.

02:06.594 --> 02:07.960
What is she talking about...

02:07.961 --> 02:09.562
I told her to give me
a couple of weeks.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.062
She knows we don't
have the votes.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.299
Then we better get them ASAP.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.533
People are tired

02:13.534 --> 02:15.101
of waiting on
Their Majesties the Harrises

02:15.102 --> 02:16.303
to give them independence.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.805
They're chucking
tea in the harbor now.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.740
The Harrises just need time.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.409
Nobody likes to be told
they're obsolete.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.444
Pop, you should be
more concerned

02:24.445 --> 02:26.213
about what your
constituents think.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.380
Izzy, can you back me up?

02:27.381 --> 02:29.582
I say listen to your son.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.451
Pernell Harris might have
millions of dollars,

02:31.452 --> 02:32.919
but he's only got one vote.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.221
One vote.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.655
And half the City Council,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.324
the DWP, and most
of the school board

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
sucking at his teat.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.228
Don't underestimate him.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.495
But you went on the record

02:42.496 --> 02:44.030
saying that the name
was going to change,

02:44.031 --> 02:45.665
so if the name doesn't change,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.467
everyone's gonna know
whose titty you're sucking.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.236
I've got calls in to three
of the four board members.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.239
Yeah, yeah. That's...
Too late for that.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.940
Thank you, though.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.343
Where are you going?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.412
You don't want to know.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.982
Here, come on.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.651
Mayor Boston?

03:04.652 --> 03:05.785
Yeah.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.953
Hey, how's it going?

03:06.954 --> 03:09.055
You have been served.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.457
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.891
Come back here, you
Urkel-looking motherfucker.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.261
Is he serious?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.233
How are you feeling, Mr. Harris?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.570
Like I've been
kicked in the face.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.005
Me getting out today?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.843
No. I'm afraid
we can't release you.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.381
God will never
release you, Pernell.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.792
More drugs.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.562
That help last time?

04:57.765 --> 04:58.965
God sees you,

04:58.966 --> 05:01.634
whether you want Him to or not.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.504
There's no escaping Him.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.446
You know who I am?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.058
His wife.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.467
It's not poisoned.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.043
On TV you said
you were being framed.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.745
Look me in the eye

05:45.746 --> 05:49.449
and tell me you didn't
murder my husband.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.118
I didn't kill him.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.156
Did you know Julio Farkas
was looking for you?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.958
Yeah.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.762
I heard that
after they found the body.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.499
I had nothing to do
with that, either.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.167
You know,

06:08.168 --> 06:10.537
no matter what you think,

06:10.538 --> 06:12.271
Shane was a good man.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.873
He loved his family.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.642
Just wanted us
to have nice things.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.209
And when it got to be too much,

06:17.210 --> 06:19.647
he tried to quit,
but they wouldn't let him.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.716
Who wouldn't let him?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.919
Shane made a video recording.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.823
He thought it would help him
get out of the life.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.193
Julio was bringing it to you.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.929
It's probably why he was killed.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.197
You have it?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.467
I can tell you what's on it,

06:40.468 --> 06:41.934
but not for free.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.571
I need to get my kids
the hell out of this town.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.005
If you don't have
the recording...

06:46.006 --> 06:47.874
You want to know
what's on that recording?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.643
Believe me, it's not
just about dirty cops.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.979
It's about your son.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.948
Ma'am, you can't be in here.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.550
No, no, it's okay.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.152
She's family.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.788
I don't care who she is.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.658
Visiting hours
don't start until 9.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.838
I can't get a name off
of Apex's phone number.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.940
He's Casper the fucking Ghost.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.008
So Plan B.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.042
Wait.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.911
I can at least...

07:24.912 --> 07:27.515
narrow down where his
calls are coming from.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.218
Shit. He's using
an IMEI generator.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.186
It's to hide his location.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.354
He could be right next door,

07:35.355 --> 07:36.556
but the call would look

07:36.557 --> 07:38.290
like it's coming from Spokane

07:38.291 --> 07:40.059
or wherever the fuck.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.394
There's even one
from Yemen on here.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.796
Bitch-ass.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.532
You're running
out of swear words.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.266
God damn it.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.701
Okay, so Plan B.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.670
I just call him and I tell him...

07:50.671 --> 07:52.705
No. That's Plan Stupid.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.641
He's going to be
expecting Anne Wu,

07:54.642 --> 07:56.075
and I haven't heard you
do a British accent,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.111
but I bet it sucks.
He won't believe you.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.888
Can I get you something?

08:11.224 --> 08:12.925
I work better
when I'm not starving.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.427
Plus I'm waiting to hear
back from a friend

08:15.428 --> 08:17.097
who knows the phone game
better than me.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.401
Too late.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.603
You texted him.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.337
He has the encryption key,

08:25.338 --> 08:26.639
and he wants us to call him.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.174
I'm risking everything
to help you,

08:28.175 --> 08:30.743
and you blow it because
you can't wait an hour?

08:30.744 --> 08:34.948
"50K 8 p.m. tonight.
Same place."

08:36.316 --> 08:37.918
Same place?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.222
Okay. And?

08:43.323 --> 08:44.957
Where's the meeting?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.593
Shit.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.628
Postpone until we can
figure it out.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.262
I'll tell him we need a few days

08:50.263 --> 08:51.765
to get the money together.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.041
"Now or never."

09:03.310 --> 09:04.310
Fuck.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.836
Did you check downstairs?

09:29.837 --> 09:32.205
Yeah. He's not here.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.908
Just tell me what's got
you so freaked out.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.344
Alicia, I just...
I... I need to think.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.445
About what?

09:39.446 --> 09:40.980
Why are you making
such a big deal

09:40.981 --> 09:42.716
- out of the subpoena?
- If...

09:43.784 --> 09:46.152
If Pernell thinks
I'm going to talk,

09:46.153 --> 09:48.387
he's going to send KD
to kill me.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.122
I need to go to Pernell

09:50.123 --> 09:52.825
and promise I'm not
going to say anything.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.494
Maybe you should come with me.
He likes you.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.063
And plus if you're there...

09:57.064 --> 09:58.931
Paul, what could you
possibly say?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.334
Why are they so afraid
of you testifying?

10:02.469 --> 10:05.037
The night I baptized KD,

10:05.038 --> 10:08.040
he begged me
to take his confession.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.209
He said he killed people,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.945
including that police
officer Shane Caldwell.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.082
And he did it because
Pernell told him to do so.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.384
Yeah.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.759
Working on your memoirs?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.427
Did I tell you to watch McCauley

10:28.428 --> 10:30.663
trying to discredit me on TV?

10:30.664 --> 10:33.599
Fucker's been on every
goddamn channel this morning.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.202
When you accuse the cops and
prosecution of corruption,

10:36.203 --> 10:37.971
you had to know they'd
come back swinging.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.441
What if I'm right, Bobo?

10:42.442 --> 10:43.676
What if they're dirty

10:43.677 --> 10:44.911
and they're just afraid

10:44.912 --> 10:46.245
I'm going to expose them?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.814
Pernell, that was
a brilliant move.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.148
I'm sure you planted
a seed of doubt

10:49.149 --> 10:50.750
in every potential juror's mind,

10:50.751 --> 10:53.753
but, conspiracy
against Pernell Harris?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.521
I mean, I don't... Okay.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.689
We got other stuff
to talk about.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.024
Yeah, I talked to Tramble.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.591
I know about the subpoena.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.027
No, no. I can handle McCauley.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.929
I'm... I'm here
for something else.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.231
What else is there?

11:05.365 --> 11:06.834
Ahem.

11:09.369 --> 11:13.372
The whole name change
at Harris High School.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.374
I thought you said
that was going to blow over.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.910
Yeah, well, it's,
it's gotten bigger.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.245
Time is not on my side.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.381
The full change squad
is forcing a vote tonight,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.050
and if the school board
doesn't change the name,

11:24.051 --> 11:25.517
I'm on the verge
of losing my base.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.420
Ungrateful assholes.

11:28.756 --> 11:29.923
Ahem.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.391
Don't tell me you think

11:32.392 --> 11:34.927
an 80% black and brown school
should still be named

11:34.928 --> 11:36.863
after your dead
racist fuck grandpa.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.198
You know what?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.000
Just leave it up to the board.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.501
If they want to change the name,

11:42.502 --> 11:43.803
I won't get in the way.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.537
Good. Yes.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.439
Happy to hear that.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.810
But you know the school board
wouldn't wipe their asses

11:50.811 --> 11:52.378
without the Harris
family blessing,

11:52.379 --> 11:55.014
and your aunt Val already
put the fear of God in them.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.415
I mean, they're not going
to change anything

11:56.416 --> 11:58.384
unless you personally
tell them it's okay.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.451
So I need you there.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.953
Come on, Pernell.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.889
Let's just you and me
get this over with.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.256
You just don't get it, do you?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.958
You got a platoon
full of fucking kids,

12:05.959 --> 12:06.993
and I got a dead son.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.327
They're already lining up

12:08.328 --> 12:09.461
the firing squad for me.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.697
The future of my entire
family is at stake,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.900
and now you want me
to disavow my past?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.234
Are you kidding me?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.203
You got Harris Park,
the Harris Building,

12:17.204 --> 12:18.939
half the streets in this city.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.646
Okay.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.117
Let me put it to you like this.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.824
Every time you needed me,
I've had your back.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.260
Now I need something,
and where are you?

12:42.629 --> 12:44.964
Do you know what it feels like
to put someone else first?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.732
I put the "Mayor"
in front of your name.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.135
How's that feel?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.837
You didn't make me mayor.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.138
You just sped things up.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.106
Who gets the credit,
the horse or the jockey?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.441
I don't know. You tell me.
You still remember

12:55.442 --> 12:57.176
the name of the guy
who rode Secretariat?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.444
Fuck you.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.512
See what I mean?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.253
Pernell,

13:07.254 --> 13:09.321
the future you're talking about,

13:09.322 --> 13:10.722
it's not just yours.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.225
It's ours.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.095
Wasn't that the plan?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.230
I mean...

13:19.599 --> 13:21.068
That's what I want.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.874
Don't mess this up
over some words on a wall.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.881
I'll be there.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.884
Thank you, brother.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.187
You got me pulling teeth
over here?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.288
Want me to send a car

13:42.289 --> 13:43.722
to come pick you up tonight?

13:43.723 --> 13:44.756
No, I'm good.

13:44.757 --> 13:45.992
Hey, how about a candy striper

13:45.993 --> 13:47.360
give you a little sponge bath?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.931
Nothing?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.033
There's six or seven
mentions of a meeting,

13:54.034 --> 13:56.335
but they only talk
about date and time,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.370
never where.

14:01.608 --> 14:06.913
If I had the GPS records
from Anne's personal cell,

14:06.914 --> 14:09.181
I could correlate its location

14:09.182 --> 14:10.782
with these dates and times.

14:10.783 --> 14:11.918
It wouldn't be that hard

14:11.919 --> 14:13.285
to find the location
of the meeting.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.720
Let's do it.
Let's get the records.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.988
I tried remote accessing
Anne's phone

14:15.989 --> 14:17.924
for weeks. It's dead.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.326
Yeah.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.136
I think I know another way
to get those records.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.741
What are you doing here?

14:35.742 --> 14:37.144
Here.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.146
This ought to help you
start a new life.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.414
What are you talking about?

14:43.783 --> 14:45.351
Look, if you want more money,

14:45.352 --> 14:47.419
I'm going to have to hear
what I'm paying for.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.221
- I don't want your money.
- Hey.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.790
Hey. Didn't you come by
my hospital room this morning?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.225
Do you want me to call 911?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.827
How about Lesley Levay?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.296
That would be a good story.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.798
Kill a cop, now you're
harassing his widow?

14:59.799 --> 15:01.969
I'm sorry. I thought you...

15:27.194 --> 15:28.594
- You ready?
- Yeah.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.732
3, 2, 1. Liftoff!

15:34.334 --> 15:35.334
Ha ha!

15:45.345 --> 15:46.446
Hey.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.847
- Here.
- Okay.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.016
I got you.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.617
Still no word
from the inspector?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.019
He called.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.787
He said he'd be here
between 12 and 5.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.324
That's great.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.027
It's not like I have
things to do.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.263
Hey, guess who helped me
at the store today.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.098
Who?

16:05.099 --> 16:06.265
Remember that girl

16:06.266 --> 16:07.899
that was flirting with you?

16:07.900 --> 16:09.701
Renata?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.303
Yeah, you remember.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.273
I told her you thought
she was cute.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.441
Well, I wish you didn't.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.309
Well, it made her smile.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.878
And she asked me to give
you her phone number.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.214
Well, I don't need you
to speak for me.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.083
Now don't be shy, KD.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.052
I promise if you ask her out,

16:26.053 --> 16:27.486
she'll say yes.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.821
- I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.190
That's why you knew who she was

16:31.191 --> 16:32.524
as soon as I brought her up.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.193
I'm telling you,
a girl that pretty,

16:34.194 --> 16:36.262
she'll be snatched up
if you wait too long.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.830
Look, just call her and say hi.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.466
I don't want to, I said!

16:40.467 --> 16:43.303
I didn't ask you
to speak for me.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.442
I'll clean all this up.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.453
Got something a little special.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.888
I don't have time for that.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.191
Did you get them?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.526
You the judge?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.961
- You the hacker?
- Play nice.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.597
Do you have the records?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.433
Would you mind
giving us a second?

17:20.507 --> 17:23.276
Pernell,
there's a clock on this.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.479
Remember our trip to Morro Bay?

17:28.181 --> 17:30.216
This was the champagne.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.784
Épée et Bouclier.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.121
Can we not stroll down
Memory Lane right now?

17:35.122 --> 17:36.856
Are you gonna help me or not?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.326
Subpoenas went out today.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.729
That means the trial is
just around the corner.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.631
God only knows
when the next time

17:45.632 --> 17:47.833
you and me are going to have
a chance to drink together.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.000
Well, we can do this later.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.736
We could have dinner
at the Court Club.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.404
- How about that?
- Can you just sit down

17:52.405 --> 17:54.173
for two minutes and drink
your goddamn champagne

17:54.174 --> 17:55.708
and listen to my goddamn story?

18:01.981 --> 18:03.615
First time I drank this,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.517
my old man had just
kicked me out on my ass.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.952
He threatened to cut me off,

18:06.953 --> 18:08.154
stop paying for my law school,

18:08.155 --> 18:09.289
and...

18:10.323 --> 18:12.224
I'll never forget what you said.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.992
You said, "You're going
to finish law school"

18:13.993 --> 18:15.327
"if I got to fuck the dean

18:15.328 --> 18:17.463
and the whole fucking faculty."

18:17.464 --> 18:19.732
I knew right then and there
you were the girl for me.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.035
We shouldn't have
to go back 31 years

18:24.036 --> 18:26.638
to find a good memory.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.308
Next day...

18:29.542 --> 18:31.377
went out and sold
my old man's Rolex.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.180
Bought a bottle of Épée...

18:34.547 --> 18:36.448
and your engagement ring,

18:36.449 --> 18:38.785
which you should be
wearing right now.

18:40.787 --> 18:44.055
Used to be you and me
against the world once.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.292
Remember?

18:47.427 --> 18:51.297
I remember telling you
I didn't need a ring,

18:51.298 --> 18:54.201
and you didn't listen
to me then, either.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.405
Do you have the phone records?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.407
I couldn't get them in one day,

19:01.408 --> 19:02.708
even if I had a court order.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.975
What the fuck!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.511
That's not what you
said, Pernell.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.579
Well, I can get you
Anne's phone.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.216
That's as good, isn't it?

19:10.217 --> 19:12.219
How?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.958
So we're just going to sit
here for three hours

19:19.959 --> 19:21.228
and not say anything?

19:28.301 --> 19:31.102
I didn't mean
to upset you earlier.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.273
I thought I was being nice.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.475
You were.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.977
I shouldn't have acted that way.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.480
Why did you?

19:44.251 --> 19:46.253
KD, we're friends, right?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.620
I'd like to think so.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.422
See, now, friends can
talk to each other

19:50.423 --> 19:52.023
about things like this.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.392
They help each other.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.527
They trust each other.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.796
Whatever it was that
made you get so upset,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.898
that's something
you should talk about

19:59.899 --> 20:01.301
with a friend.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.441
Girls like Renata...

20:09.842 --> 20:12.545
you're supposed to take them
out on real dates...

20:13.946 --> 20:16.114
nice dinner,

20:16.115 --> 20:17.817
go to a movie...

20:18.951 --> 20:20.620
hold hands and stuff.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.154
What's wrong with that?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.490
Nothing. I...

20:24.491 --> 20:27.726
I've never done that before.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.828
Never?

20:29.829 --> 20:32.498
No, that can't be.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.866
This is stupid.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.067
No, no. I'm just...

20:36.068 --> 20:37.736
I'm just surprised.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.838
So wait. When you say never,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.508
- do you mean...
- No. That's not what I'm saying.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.776
I've been with women,
just not like her.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.845
I wouldn't even know how
to kiss someone like Renata,

20:46.846 --> 20:50.650
or... that's just not
what I'm used to.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.985
See? Stupid.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.053
No. No, it's not.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.088
It's a little sad

20:57.089 --> 20:59.057
but kind of sweet.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.859
But it... it's not stupid.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.762
Well, that's why I
don't ask girls out,

21:03.763 --> 21:05.631
because how do you explain that?

21:05.632 --> 21:06.965
I don't want to do that.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.336
Say, Keith, you in here?

21:25.385 --> 21:26.719
Is there something you needed?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.458
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, in the back.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.371
I'm, picking a color
for the trim.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.074
You have a favorite?

21:51.378 --> 21:53.244
They're all white.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.647
Not all whites are the same.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.755
We should go.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.257
I'm sure Pernell already
knows that we're here.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.394
This is Gilbert McCauley.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.661
He's prosecuting
the Harris case.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.597
I asked him to join us.

22:10.598 --> 22:13.131
Mr. McCauley,

22:13.132 --> 22:14.933
as we already told Chief Clay,

22:14.934 --> 22:16.234
you have the wrong idea.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.669
Paul is not going to testify,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.771
so you need to take him
off the witness list.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.772
Now.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.242
I'm afraid that's not
how it works.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.777
I don't need your cooperation.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.679
I can compel you to testify.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.981
And if you don't,
I can arrest you.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.282
We don't think so.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.251
According to California
Evidence Code.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.686
Section 1034,

22:34.687 --> 22:36.955
clergy cannot
be made to testify.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.492
Reverend Curtis doesn't
have to say a thing.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.000
Is someone threatening
you, Reverend?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.537
Do you need protection?

22:52.104 --> 22:54.039
We can help you.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.609
You just have to tell us
what you know.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.618
I'm not saying a word.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.286
You can't protect me.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.021
And considering
Pernell's on trial

23:10.022 --> 23:11.222
for murdering a cop,

23:11.223 --> 23:14.561
it seems like you can't
even protect yourselves.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.640
Better walk from here.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.710
I'll be back.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.659
You mad?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.335
Hey, Crys.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.539
Come on. I didn't know
she was going to be there.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.374
You probably should have
called first.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.743
Awkward having two wives

24:04.744 --> 24:06.512
in the same room
at the same time.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.546
Crys, I told you.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.747
I haven't seen,

24:08.748 --> 24:10.415
I haven't spoken
to Tessie in months.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.884
Hey, marry as many
hookers as you want.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.522
I'm not mad. You're not
my problem anymore.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.393
You're pissed.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.362
I can tell. And you know what?

24:24.363 --> 24:25.697
- Don't.
- I'm all for it.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.132
Don't tell me what I'm feeling.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.367
No. You're pissed.
That means you still care.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.636
No. It means you're an asshole.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.538
Who you love. Who you love.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.639
Loved.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.140
Past tense, right? Right?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.407
That's why you're so mad?

24:36.408 --> 24:37.909
That's why you want
to hit me right now?

24:37.910 --> 24:40.378
You want to hit me
right now. I know you do.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.248
Shit.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.885
Holy shit!

24:49.722 --> 24:51.257
Well, I guess I was right?

24:54.326 --> 24:55.662
Actually...

24:57.029 --> 24:58.664
I wasn't even thinking about it

24:58.665 --> 24:59.966
till you brought it up.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.650
Don't worry. You'll have time.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.620
If he ever gets back.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.660
It's dirt, not dust.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.729
Here.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.271
Thank you.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.042
Water?

26:22.481 --> 26:23.749
So how do you know

26:23.750 --> 26:25.951
this Apex guy's got
the encryption key?

26:25.952 --> 26:27.252
I don't.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.321
I'm hoping he does.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.662
You should let me come
with you in this meeting.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.967
Maybe.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.170
You should also let me
move back in.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.842
I thought I was on a roll.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.679
Maybe.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.215
This is it.

27:06.993 --> 27:07.993
Thanks.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.540
Let's go, let's go.
We've got four hours.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.710
Phone records.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.478
Where did you get that?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.714
Doesn't matter where we got it.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.015
The hell it doesn't.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.817
The woman who
that phone belongs to

27:31.818 --> 27:34.086
is missing at best.

27:35.888 --> 27:39.791
I know because I tried
to track her down.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.727
She hasn't used
her credit cards,

27:41.728 --> 27:44.229
sent an email,
posted a selfie, nothing.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.397
She hasn't even
contacted her family.

27:46.398 --> 27:50.002
So when you walk in
with her phone, it matters.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.505
Wilson, wait. Listen to me.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.641
You told me you didn't know
what happened to Anne

27:56.642 --> 27:57.976
or where she was.

27:57.977 --> 28:01.146
So where did you get that?

28:01.147 --> 28:02.414
Crystal.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.320
- I killed her.
- Crys.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.822
What did you say?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.924
- I killed her.
- Crys!

28:12.925 --> 28:14.492
- Stop it!
- I...

28:14.493 --> 28:16.395
I didn't mean to, but...

28:20.967 --> 28:24.771
Do you even know
what Anne did to get this?

28:26.172 --> 28:27.405
She seduced PJ.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.808
She had his wife raped
right in front of him.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.342
He killed himself,
my only child,

28:31.343 --> 28:33.078
because he thought
it was all his fault

28:33.079 --> 28:34.913
and he couldn't live with it,
and who could?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.047
And my husband?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.448
She broke him with grief...

28:37.449 --> 28:38.950
Stop it. I don't want
to hear this.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.385
- No. No.
- Don't touch me.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.487
Listen to me. You are
going to understand

28:42.488 --> 28:44.089
because you're not leaving here

28:44.090 --> 28:45.590
until we've finished this.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.359
Finished what?

28:48.494 --> 28:49.694
This.

28:49.695 --> 28:52.430
This is what Anne wanted,

28:52.431 --> 28:55.000
and her greed and her spite
and her jealousy

28:55.001 --> 28:57.368
destroyed my family.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.905
This is all I have left.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.473
And I am begging you.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.642
This is PJ's legacy.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.678
If we don't give it
to the world,

29:07.679 --> 29:09.481
like he intended...

29:11.717 --> 29:13.551
then I have nothing.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.421
Please.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.195
I'll help you
find the meeting spot...

29:24.530 --> 29:26.065
but then I'm out.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.837
I'm here.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.505
Hey. Did the inspector come?

29:34.506 --> 29:37.275
No. What if he did?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.010
And what if he had questions

29:39.011 --> 29:41.312
about things I don't
know the answer to?

29:41.313 --> 29:43.382
I'm back now.
I can finish those.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.451
Okay, but Pernell shows up,

29:46.452 --> 29:49.287
and you just drop everything
and disappear for two hours?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.288
For what?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.024
It was important.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.926
What was important?

29:54.927 --> 29:57.328
What do you do for him, KD?

29:57.329 --> 29:58.230
Ahem.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.998
I could ask you
the same question.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.268
I saw the way you acted
when he walked in.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.337
It seemed like people had a lot
of stuff they didn't want to say.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.738
What was that about?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.540
I don't want to talk about it.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.709
Why not?

30:11.710 --> 30:14.213
We're friends, right?

30:17.216 --> 30:19.617
Pernell used to be
one of my clients.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.519
You understand?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.154
You're a prostitute.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.356
I was.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.425
Yeah, but the way you acted,

30:27.426 --> 30:31.462
there was
something more than that.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.198
A former client
walks in with his wife?

30:33.199 --> 30:34.699
I'm not offering them lemonade.

30:34.700 --> 30:35.833
I mean, it was awkward.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.168
What do you want me to say?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.604
Why did you hide
behind that table?

30:44.977 --> 30:46.478
Shouldn't he be told?

30:47.914 --> 30:50.515
I want to raise
this baby by myself

30:50.516 --> 30:53.118
without any complications.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.785
If Pernell knew about it,

30:54.786 --> 30:56.221
he would want to be
a part of it.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.722
He would want to control it.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.324
That is the kind of man he is.

30:59.325 --> 31:03.394
It would probably turn
into some custody thing,

31:03.395 --> 31:04.930
and me against him?

31:04.931 --> 31:06.497
I know how that would turn out.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.233
Yeah,

31:08.234 --> 31:10.435
maybe he just
would want to help.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.838
Well, I'm not
taking any chances.

31:13.839 --> 31:16.507
I am never going to tell him.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.976
And neither are you.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.445
You hear me?

31:20.679 --> 31:21.947
Okay.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.549
Promise me.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.419
I promise.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.965
Crys, I... I promised Bobo.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.733
Go.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.970
I should be back
in plenty of time.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.504
Don't.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.008
- But the meeting...
- No.

31:59.385 --> 32:03.388
Crys, you can't keep blaming
me for what happened.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.389
I don't.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.026
You didn't make me do it.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.894
You didn't put the bottle
in my hand.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.163
But if you hadn't snapped,

32:12.164 --> 32:13.631
I never would have been there.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.234
And that's what scares me.

32:16.702 --> 32:19.004
How bad it could be
when it happens again.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.538
It won't.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.808
It's all in the past.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.511
I know you want that.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.382
You almost had me
believing it's true.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.019
You're still having visions.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.455
Crys, no. No.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.125
The medicine I'm taking
is for anxiety.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.027
I mean, come on.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.429
Haven't you heard?
I'm on trial for murder.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.533
I know about Dr. Olinari.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.807
- He told you.
- No.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.810
Don't blame Bobo. He's scared.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.846
We're going to fix it.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.216
That's what this doctor's for.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.686
I hope you're right.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.657
I do.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.727
- Crys.
- Don't.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.600
I need you to go, Pernell.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.926
Everything looks good.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.295
Got to say, Ms. Graham,

33:50.296 --> 33:52.330
I thought this place
was a lost cause.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.999
I'm impressed you were
able to rescue it.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.402
Thank you.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.604
Thank you very much.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.473
I'll help you...

34:02.641 --> 34:04.110
Thank you.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.346
He's right. You did
a fantastic job, KD.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.715
I burned it. I got
to make it right.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.118
Now it looks better
than it did before.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.786
Once you pick the paint,
it'll really sparkle.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.293
Hey, I...

34:23.329 --> 34:26.597
I want to try something
before I go.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.965
What?

34:27.966 --> 34:29.134
Close your eyes.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.136
No. You don't have to.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.139
No. I... I want to, KD.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.974
I'm not a charity case.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.042
I know that.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.043
We're friends, right?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.946
Yeah.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.150
So close your eyes.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.737
Now you kiss me.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.187
Now this time I want you

35:22.188 --> 35:24.222
to part your lips a little more.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.657
Keep them soft, gentle.

35:26.658 --> 35:30.429
You don't take kisses.
You give them.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.397
You can call Renata.

36:40.732 --> 36:41.767
Okay.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.026
Watch it.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.862
She's moaning about the
name of some damn school.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.865
Not like her illiterate
kids ever show up.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.301
We show up.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.835
And we shouldn't have to put up

37:17.836 --> 37:19.938
with racists like you
when we do.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.315
You want me to call him?

37:30.316 --> 37:31.549
No, he said he'd be here.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.950
But if Pernell doesn't show,

37:32.951 --> 37:34.585
what are your chances?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.321
You should bail, Pop.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.788
He's going to have you
standing here

37:37.789 --> 37:39.324
looking like Carrie at the prom.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.459
Who's that?

37:41.927 --> 37:43.461
Thank you, my friend.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.331
Anything for a pal.

37:46.765 --> 37:47.932
You all right?

37:47.933 --> 37:50.234
Yeah. Fine.

37:50.235 --> 37:51.402
Please take your seats.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.503
Crystal sends her best.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.104
Settle.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.173
Settle.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.975
Have a seat.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.210
We want to thank everyone
for sharing their thoughts

38:00.211 --> 38:01.879
during the public comments,

38:01.880 --> 38:05.350
some of you more
enthusiastically than others.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.652
Now, before we move on
to the vote,

38:07.653 --> 38:09.920
Pernell Harris
has asked to speak.

38:09.921 --> 38:13.359
We thought it only appropriate
that we allow him a statement.

38:23.669 --> 38:27.204
Ahem. My, great-grandfather

38:27.205 --> 38:29.106
was not a good man.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.475
That's right.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.076
But he was a great one.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.380
Come on.

38:36.715 --> 38:40.751
Eli Harris built
this town from nothing

38:40.752 --> 38:43.120
with little more
than his bare hands.

38:43.121 --> 38:45.823
His name is carved
into the cornerstone

38:45.824 --> 38:47.958
of the very building we are
sitting in right now.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.395
Should we be surprised
that he had flaws?

38:50.396 --> 38:53.063
I don't think so.
What great man doesn't?

38:53.064 --> 38:54.532
Washington had slaves.

38:54.533 --> 38:59.470
And hell,
Jefferson raped his slaves.

38:59.471 --> 39:03.574
And yet we aren't
picketing the schools

39:03.575 --> 39:05.176
that are named after them.

39:06.311 --> 39:09.680
Eli Harris said some...

39:09.681 --> 39:12.483
very ignorant,
very hurtful things,

39:12.484 --> 39:15.053
and, and his descendant,
I apologize for that.

39:16.422 --> 39:19.757
But I... I think
those words are outweighed

39:19.758 --> 39:22.960
by what he did for this town.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.596
He put this great city
on the map.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.533
To take his name
off of a building

39:28.534 --> 39:30.468
is to betray San Vicente.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.770
And I would rather die

39:32.771 --> 39:35.206
than to betray my city
like that.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.085
Leave the name the way it is,

39:48.086 --> 39:49.588
the way it should be.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.252
Looks like you had a good day.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.754
Pssh.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.790
Well, It's going to get
even better.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.960
I got summoned by McCauley.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.362
Prick's just giving these
out like candy?

40:32.363 --> 40:34.465
It gets worse.

40:34.466 --> 40:38.503
I heard from my friend Betsy
at the DA's office

40:38.504 --> 40:43.107
that McCauley drew up
witness-v papers

40:43.108 --> 40:44.542
for Paul Curtis.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.812
Sounds like that boy band
preacher of yours

40:47.813 --> 40:50.881
is selling his testimony.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.183
Shit.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.887
Drop by the chapel any time.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.422
- We'd love to have you.
- Thank you.

40:58.423 --> 40:59.990
You fucking hustler!

40:59.991 --> 41:01.659
You ruined my life.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.160
Now you want to sell me out?

41:03.161 --> 41:05.996
I ruined your life?
I brought you to the Lord.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.598
You should look inside yourself

41:07.599 --> 41:09.166
and ask how you
could fall so far.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.267
Maybe I am falling,

41:10.268 --> 41:11.636
but it started with a push.

41:11.637 --> 41:12.803
- Don't touch him!
- It's fine.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.673
My son dies. I lose my balance.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.141
Do you lift me up?

41:17.142 --> 41:19.677
No. You just kept pushing

41:19.678 --> 41:22.146
till a few more bucks
fell out of my pocket

41:22.147 --> 41:23.614
and then another push

41:23.615 --> 41:24.950
and another!

41:27.285 --> 41:29.086
You think this guy
is a preacher?

41:29.087 --> 41:32.022
He's a fucking vampire.
He'll suck out your soul,

41:32.023 --> 41:34.559
and then he'll sell it back
to you for 50 grand a pop.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.160
Sir, you can turn
your back on God,

41:36.161 --> 41:37.795
but He will never
turn His back on you.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.764
You know why?
Because you've been found.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.766
Really? Which God found me?

41:41.767 --> 41:44.134
The one that sends planes
into the Twin Towers

41:44.135 --> 41:46.470
or the one that kills
little kids in school?

41:46.471 --> 41:47.772
Which God, Reverend?

41:47.773 --> 41:50.307
The God you reach for
in your darkest hour.

41:50.308 --> 41:51.441
I ain't reaching for shit.

41:51.442 --> 41:52.743
Then why are you here?

41:52.744 --> 41:53.911
You're here because
you're suffering.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.445
- Bullshit!
- The Bible says

41:55.446 --> 41:57.582
when you are suffering,
return to the Lord your God

41:57.583 --> 41:59.717
and listen to Him.
He will not abandon you

41:59.718 --> 42:01.385
or forget the oath
He promised you.

42:01.386 --> 42:03.320
God doesn't keep his oaths.
God doesn't make oaths.

42:03.321 --> 42:05.990
There is no God.
There's only people like you

42:05.991 --> 42:09.660
who lie to people
who are weak and confused.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.228
You tell us
we can depend on God.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.932
He'll always fail us!
Every goddamn time!

42:14.933 --> 42:16.466
It isn't God that fails us.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.937
It's our faith in Him
that fails us.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.472
- Man.
- Are you... What?

42:22.473 --> 42:24.074
God doesn't exist, asshole.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.177
If God doesn't exist,
why are you so angry at Him?

42:27.178 --> 42:29.379
You're mad at God
because He didn't give you

42:29.380 --> 42:30.948
what you wanted on your terms.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.950
But he is God.
He's not your fucking bellboy!

42:32.951 --> 42:34.719
Somebody do something!

42:34.720 --> 42:36.754
And no matter how hard you hit

42:36.755 --> 42:38.388
or how far you run,

42:38.389 --> 42:39.724
there's no escaping Him...

42:39.725 --> 42:43.027
Not for me, not for you,
not for anyone...

42:43.028 --> 42:44.394
Because you've been found!

42:44.395 --> 42:45.697
You've been found!

42:46.932 --> 42:48.099
God, Paul.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.037
What is wrong with you?

42:55.173 --> 42:56.506
How I feel about you,

42:56.507 --> 42:58.777
but I don't know if I do.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.813
But I can't do this anymore.

43:02.814 --> 43:07.417
Anne, please...

43:07.418 --> 43:09.186
please...

43:09.187 --> 43:10.889
stop calling.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.662
Jocelyn and I...

43:19.030 --> 43:20.966
we're trying to have a baby.

43:25.203 --> 43:28.939
Um, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have let...

43:28.940 --> 43:30.676
- This is fucked up.
- No, no, no.

43:31.977 --> 43:33.679
Wasn't fair to you.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.347
You got to let me go.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.684
I was starting to forget
what his voice sounded like.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.218
Okay?

43:41.219 --> 43:43.688
You don't think it's going
to happen, but it does.

43:43.689 --> 43:44.756
Goodbye.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.727
I don't have time for this shit.

43:50.295 --> 43:53.297
Wilson, thank you.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.866
Thank you for...

43:55.867 --> 43:57.302
getting me to this point.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.305
I found the location.

44:01.306 --> 44:03.240
Corner of Sutter and York
on the east side.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.343
I'll meet you there
in a couple of hours?

44:07.713 --> 44:09.280
I thought you were done with me.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.983
We've gotten this far together.

44:14.219 --> 44:16.987
Plus I'd like to see the look
on Apex' face

44:16.988 --> 44:19.089
when he realizes
that we're not Anne Wu.

44:19.090 --> 44:24.763
He is not going to care
who we are because...

44:26.631 --> 44:28.233
we're paying him double.

44:37.075 --> 44:38.075
Hey.

44:41.747 --> 44:43.749
Sorry.

44:46.284 --> 44:48.352
- Is it really bad?
- Yeah.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.420
Fuck.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.125
Shit.

44:56.161 --> 44:58.296
Somebody tagged me in the video.

45:00.598 --> 45:01.833
I did.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.069
Hashtag you've been found.

45:05.070 --> 45:06.070
Why?

45:06.071 --> 45:08.939
Because I have never
been prouder of you.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.775
And you show it by having
the whole world

45:10.776 --> 45:12.943
watch me get my ass kicked
on Worldstar?

45:12.944 --> 45:14.244
I'm a punch line now.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.114
No. They need to see
a Christian man

45:17.115 --> 45:18.382
standing up for his faith.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.451
Yeah, I wasn't standing
for much of it.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.321
Hey, live a life

45:24.322 --> 45:27.424
worthy of the calling
you've received.

45:27.425 --> 45:28.827
Be humble...

45:29.861 --> 45:31.196
and gentle.

45:32.497 --> 45:36.500
Patient, kind.

45:36.501 --> 45:38.269
Bear one another in love.

45:40.105 --> 45:41.806
You have been listening
to my sermons.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.242
I'm your biggest fan.

45:46.812 --> 45:48.445
But not your only one.

45:48.446 --> 45:49.815
Look.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.153
2,172 likes.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.843
Shit.

46:48.373 --> 46:50.440
You overheat?

46:50.441 --> 46:52.342
Excuse me?

46:52.343 --> 46:54.913
Your engine. Want me
to take a look at it?

46:55.981 --> 46:57.315
Yeah. Sure.

47:10.896 --> 47:12.529
- Where are you?
- The car broke down.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.598
What am I supposed to do
until you get here?

47:14.599 --> 47:17.902
At some point he's going to
notice I only got 20 bucks.

47:17.903 --> 47:19.336
You have to stall.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.704
With what? I ought to dance?

47:20.705 --> 47:23.440
Ma'am, here's your problem.

47:23.441 --> 47:25.709
Your radiator hose
was disconnected.

47:25.710 --> 47:28.112
If I didn't know better, I'd
say somebody had a hand in it.

47:28.113 --> 47:31.015
- Who's that?
- Wilson,

47:31.016 --> 47:33.250
d-don't wait for Apex.

47:33.251 --> 47:34.919
I need you to get in your car...

47:34.920 --> 47:36.720
Too late. He's here.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.156
Stay on the line.

47:43.694 --> 47:44.929
You Apex?

47:44.930 --> 47:45.996
You got the money?

47:45.997 --> 47:47.598
It's on the way.

47:54.405 --> 47:57.007
I reconnected your, hose.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.076
I'd let your car
run for a little bit.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.511
And you should be good to go.

48:01.746 --> 48:03.247
Ma'am?

48:03.248 --> 48:05.115
Is everything okay?

48:05.116 --> 48:07.084
Yeah, fine.

48:07.085 --> 48:09.186
If I were you, I'd get
out of this neighborhood

48:09.187 --> 48:11.289
and go home.
It's not safe after dark.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.535
Shh.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.605
Shh.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.174
It's not your fault.

48:30.175 --> 48:32.110
You just pulled
on the wrong thread.
