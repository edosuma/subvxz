WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:05.000
The Commissioner wants you
and your team to assist

00:05.000 --> 00:07.200
Christian's anti-terrorist
department on this.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.680
If we mess up this case now,
Gately will shut us down

00:09.680 --> 00:11.320
and pack us all back to Dublin.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.480
We believe there's another bomb
already in Antwerp.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.720
Which means the next attack
is imminent.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.720
Viktor Maes' National Reform Party
issued a statement.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.600
Viktor Maes and his party
are racist.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.560
James!

00:35.560 --> 00:37.480
It's talcum powder.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.200
I'm not taking the rap for anyone.
That clear?

00:41.760 --> 00:44.240
Bibi Melnick,
the woman you asked me to check,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.840
her brother's number
was found in Darren Reid's phone.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.920
Fionn always finds a way of
dragging me back into his shit.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.560
Do I need my lawyer here?
I would put him on notice.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.480
You're not a fan of his.
Pardon my French,

00:54.480 --> 00:57.560
but from what I've heard,
he's a sneaky little prick.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.400
Sometimes, Darren
would pay me to use the phone.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.880
That's Fionn Brannigan's mobile.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.040
Get us a search and seize.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.880
We have him. On this.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.880
MUSIC: AVE MARIA

01:55.880 --> 02:02.560
# Ave Maria

02:05.600 --> 02:11.600
# Gratia plena

02:12.720 --> 02:20.160
# Maria, gratia plena

02:20.160 --> 02:25.320
# Maria, gratia plena... #

02:25.320 --> 02:27.960
Let's go, boys and girls!
Everything on the computers.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.600
Copies of everything.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.560
# ..Ave Dominus

02:34.560 --> 02:38.240
# Dominus tecum

02:38.240 --> 02:45.680
# Benedicta tu in mulieribus

02:45.680 --> 02:52.400
# Et benedictus

02:52.400 --> 03:00.280
# Et benedictus fructus ventris

03:01.520 --> 03:07.640
# Ventris tui, Jesus

03:10.120 --> 03:18.040
# Ave Maria... #

03:18.040 --> 03:20.600
Let's get Brannigan's
assistant in here.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.480
May God Almighty bless you

03:24.480 --> 03:27.120
with the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.560
ALL: Amen.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.520
INDISTINCT SPEECH

03:31.520 --> 03:33.640
KEYPAD BEEPS

03:42.760 --> 03:45.160
Play nicely and
no-one need be the wiser.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.520
This is my daughter's
First Holy Communion Mass.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.800
And you're a flight risk,
so no time to stand on ceremony.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.600
Rubber stamped by the judge
who just issued the warrant.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.240
Sorry, what is this?
What's happening?

03:55.240 --> 03:57.720
This is a Criminal Assets
Bureau search, Mrs Brannigan.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.160
So if you'd like to step out here.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.800
Now? You've got to be joking.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.480
Would you rather we'd do it here?

04:03.480 --> 04:05.720
You better have a good reason
for doing this.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.680
Come on.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.400
We'll be in the restaurant
in no time. All right?

04:17.400 --> 04:19.800
Everyone place their mobile
phones in the tray.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.240
No need to touch them.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.480
The kids too.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.040
OK. No problem,
but leave the kids out of it.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.840
All the phones.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.360
It's OK. Daddy will
buy you a better one.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.680
Your watch too.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.600
Sorry... Don't touch it.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
I was only...
In the tray where we can see it.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.520
Your car keys too. Thank you!

04:50.560 --> 04:52.480
Only the one phone?

04:52.480 --> 04:55.040
No doubt you won't
take my word for it.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.760
Mrs Brannigan, you can
take the children outside now.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.560
No, I want...
Siobhan, they've seen enough.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.480
Go on to the restaurant.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.880
This shouldn't take long.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.520
OK. Come on, guys, let's go!

05:07.520 --> 05:09.600
Well done today. Come on.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.840
Your warrant.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.200
What I want is my solicitor.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.040
He's a bit busy right now.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.240
He's being searched as well.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.800
To seize and retain any material
with your name on

05:23.800 --> 05:26.560
which the officer believes
to be evidence of assets

05:26.560 --> 05:29.520
or proceeds deriving
from criminal activities.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.400
This also covers your house,
your office,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.120
all your financial records,

05:34.120 --> 05:36.080
all being searched as we speak.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.640
Your every recess.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.640
CAMERA CLICKS

05:38.640 --> 05:40.480
The tax man's never out of them.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.000
There's nothing there.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.480
There's something not right here.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.040
Get the torch to open it up.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.360
Hope there's no Semtex in the back.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.080
CHURCH BELLS RING

05:57.160 --> 05:58.560
Hey! See you!

05:59.880 --> 06:01.320
See you!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.160
Very special day.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.440
Congratulations! See you!

06:08.680 --> 06:10.720
I dread to think
where that came from.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.600
We got him. Darren Reid's call from
Crossroads Tavern is on his log.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.080
1 minute 35.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.680
Ask and you shall receive. Yeah.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.120
You said you weren't
going in today.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.880
Oh...

06:36.880 --> 06:39.240
I can't just drop everything.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.160
At least give it a couple of days.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.920
Until we can be sure that this
nutcase

06:42.920 --> 06:45.520
doesn't have any more plans for us.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.720
He'll be posting his talc
to someone else today, James.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.640
He's a crank.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.840
The Pegasus is docking today.
So I have to be there.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.720
I think we need to talk
about security.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.240
What? No!

06:58.240 --> 07:00.640
Thanks to my father
and his brilliant advice,

07:00.640 --> 07:04.280
this guy knows where we live,
where you work.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.880
Arthur... No, James, please!

07:05.880 --> 07:07.800
I grew up like that. Yeah, me too.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.920
Men in earpieces
making everyone edgy.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.200
I don't want that for him.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.920
There's a lot I don't want for him.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.560
OK, look, I'll...

07:16.560 --> 07:18.080
I'll think about it.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.320
OK.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.880
Is that your dress
for the fundraiser?

07:22.880 --> 07:24.480
Mm-hm.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.840
Hmm...

07:25.840 --> 07:27.200
SHE LAUGHS

07:28.680 --> 07:30.960
The Children's Hospital thanks you.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.720
How long do you think
is left of his movie?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.200
Seems like a long one.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.000
Nice try!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.840
I have to go to work.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.160
Try not to call anybody
any names today.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.640
Bye, sweetie!

07:52.120 --> 07:53.960
DOOR CLOSES

08:34.080 --> 08:35.800
DOOR BEEPS

08:53.520 --> 08:54.800
Holy shit!

09:05.280 --> 09:06.920
Hey, hey, hey!

09:36.640 --> 09:38.240
EMER: He is neck-deep in this.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.800
The apartment used the build
the Antwerp bomb is owned

09:42.800 --> 09:44.400
by his drug dealer.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.480
And the woman murdered in it
is an employee of his sister.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.600
Sana Retz.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.200
Darren Reid called him

09:50.200 --> 09:53.200
when he found out that Belgian
Police wanted to talk to him.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.680
And then ends up executed
by the same men

09:55.680 --> 09:58.040
that the Belgian CTU believe

09:58.040 --> 10:00.800
could be the same men
that executed Sana Retz.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.360
That is four connections between
Fionn Brannigan

10:03.360 --> 10:04.640
and the terrorist attack.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.800
But you still can't link him
directly.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.000
And you'll have to let him go

10:08.000 --> 10:10.640
if you don't come up
with something more solid.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.000
Thanks, Josh!

10:16.040 --> 10:18.640
And there he is finally is.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.320
The Dry Cleaner.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.560
Why is he called that?

10:23.560 --> 10:25.040
Because for the right price,

10:25.040 --> 10:28.280
he can get any amount
of grime out of a white collar.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.880
If he's such a big deal,
why's he so late for his client?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.600
Tactical.
He's eating into my time.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.480
He'll still need time
to brief his client.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.840
He shouldn't have been late then.
By the book, Emer.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.440
This isn't one you want to blow.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.160
PHONE RINGS

10:45.920 --> 10:47.680
Hello?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.640
I didn't think you'd pick up.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.120
Apparently I have
a few minutes to kill.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.760
What have you got out
of Brannigan?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.880
Nothing yet. I'm just
about to go in there.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.160
This Hadi Mansour
is not giving up anything.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.240
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.480
So right now, Fionn Brannigan is
all we've got to stop this bomb.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.120
No pressure, then.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
I need some more time
with my client.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.440
I gave you loads. You weren't here.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.800
11-03 DS Emer Berry
commencing the interview.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.200
Just a few informal questions.
No need to look so worried.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.640
What was the nature of your
relationship with Darren Reid?

11:42.640 --> 11:43.920
That's a no comment.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.800
We are not pursuing your
client's personal drug use.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.080
That was the extent
of our relationship.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.880
So what? You ring him up,
he delivers, type of thing?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.400
Any other contact? No.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.200
He ever call you?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.000
No.You sure?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.600
I'm sure.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.960
Do you know a pub called
the Crossroads Tavern?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.760
Darren Reid travelled
all the way out there,

12:10.760 --> 12:13.400
a few hours before he died,
to phone you.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.640
Call log.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.640
Why?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.440
He wanted paid.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.240
I hadn't settled my bill.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.560
Hardly a call he'd try to hide.

12:28.560 --> 12:34.200
No, Darren Reid had something
very important to impart to you.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.920
And the next day, he was dead.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.600
That was gangland.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.440
No, it was a highly professional
ex special-ops execution.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.520
Not something we typically
see in Ireland.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.760
You don't think I had
something to do with that?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.480
Well, then convince me otherwise.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.640
What is it he so badly
needed to tell you?

12:52.640 --> 12:54.600
No comment.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.960
It's not hard to guess.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.160
He couldn't tell you fast enough
what we just told him.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.640
That a Belgian Counter
Terrorist agent

13:02.640 --> 13:04.040
was coming to interview him.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.760
Speculation, don't comment.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.920
And he ended
with a bullet in his head.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.560
Because he wouldn't take the fall.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.240
He was going to give us the person

13:11.240 --> 13:13.480
who roped him
into buying that apartment.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.080
Pure speculation.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.280
We know he didn't buy it.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.920
He's never been to Antwerp

13:18.920 --> 13:21.440
and he hasn't got
that kind of money, we looked.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.960
And he didn't want to be involved
in an apartment

13:23.960 --> 13:26.240
that was used to engineer a bomb.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.280
DRAMATIC MUSIC

13:34.280 --> 13:35.440
Sorry. W-What?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.960
14 innocent people.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.040
What is this?

13:38.040 --> 13:40.720
This, Mr Galvin,
is a terrorist investigation.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.280
What? You're CAB.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.240
This is strictly
no comment from now on.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.400
Don't open your mouth.
Take those photographs away.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.560
Are you going to charge him
with this ridiculous...?

13:49.560 --> 13:52.040
You charge him now or...
Your client needs a break.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.800
Interview suspended for short
recess.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.640
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

13:59.000 --> 14:00.880
What the fuck was that?

14:02.880 --> 14:05.640
Is there we can keep him on?
Anything in his paperwork?

14:05.640 --> 14:08.560
Those boxes? Even if we have
to trump something up?

14:08.560 --> 14:11.120
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that, DS Berry.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.160
Let him go. You don't have anything
for an extension.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.880
We can't. He knows way too much...

14:17.880 --> 14:20.600
I need full compliance here.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.360
There are a lot
of eyes on this case

14:22.360 --> 14:25.200
from a lot of agencies
across two countries.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.520
Maybe all doubting that a
subsidiary office way out here

14:27.520 --> 14:28.800
can even handle this.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.800
Sean might have
something that could help.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.720
Well...

14:39.720 --> 14:42.520
We found these in a hidden safe
in this workplace.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.120
And look.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.840
This is one of Darren Reid's.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.120
And even better...

14:54.800 --> 14:56.720
Identical.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.320
That's Reid and Brannigan connected
beyond doubt

14:59.320 --> 15:02.680
into something way bigger
than a bit of weekend coke.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.560
That's direct evidence.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.280
You still need proof, Emer,
that these are indeed the same.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.200
They are the same.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.840
We never get raw diamonds
and now twice in one case?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.360
Verification could take days.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.400
Then start working on it
because until then,

15:16.400 --> 15:18.200
it's just more speculation.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.280
Let him go.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.240
THEY SIGH

15:21.240 --> 15:23.440
I'm sorry, Emer,
I wish I could do more.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.680
Put surveillance on him
and if you get anything else,

15:25.680 --> 15:27.160
come straight back to me.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.280
I need another shot, Norah.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.800
The sight of these
might make him crack.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.800
Go on.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.600
FOOTSTEPS DEPART

15:57.240 --> 15:59.880
Reid's. Yours.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.760
Identical.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.720
Which binds the two of you
beyond question

16:03.720 --> 16:05.720
in some sort of hefty transaction.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.160
No comment.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.160
Is this how he bought
the apartment for you?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.800
Cos it would certainly explain
why we couldn't trace it.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.720
Are you both on the payroll
for someone higher up?

16:14.720 --> 16:17.240
Someone who killed 14 people?

16:18.520 --> 16:22.640
See, I don't have you down
as a class of terrorist, Fionn.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.040
I think you lay down with dogs

16:24.040 --> 16:26.160
and got up with more
than you could handle.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.200
We have intel that
another bomb is imminent.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.680
You can help us stop it

16:32.680 --> 16:35.600
and we can talk
about lessening your sentence.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.040
But I suspect what you really need
most from us now is protection.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.520
You're the same threat to them now
as Darren Reid was.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.040
Sitting here in the
police station all day,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.840
talking about God knows what.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.520
I won't be making you another offer.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.960
You help us now or don't bother.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.600
Fionn.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.720
Get me out of here.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.320
My client has told you
everything he can.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.920
Those are pretty, by the way.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.040
But unless you got
certificates or something,

17:20.040 --> 17:21.760
it's speculation.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.400
Speculation.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.240
Watch out for motor bikes.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.480
Yeah?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.600
We lost him.
We had to let him go.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.560
Not sure how much he knows
about this terror campaign,

18:47.560 --> 18:51.560
but I'm pretty sure he knows enough
to get you to someone who does.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.320
Uh, surveillance?

18:53.320 --> 18:54.720
We'll get him back.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.520
Keep a tail on him and go
through his paperwork until...

18:59.760 --> 19:01.720
He's looking at Darren Reid's blood.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.560

20:09.280 --> 20:11.360
The Harbour Master was here.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.720
No! No!

20:12.720 --> 20:14.840
Our trading license
has been suspended.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.240
Citing that we pose a threat
to the port security.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.560
He can't suspend our license
without a hearing.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.120
He just did.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.160
They've done it, James.
They've suspended my license.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.440
Hey, they're just
following protocol.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.800
Look, they have to hold
a hearing within ten days.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.520
Then you get your full license back.
Ten days?

20:48.520 --> 20:51.080
I'll usher everything
through myself. I promise.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.160
OK.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.680
Thanks.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.080
Thank you for meeting me.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.920
It's not a problem, what's up?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.480
The Port Authority
have taken my license.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.160
No warning, nothing.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.600
What am I going to do?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.400
Did you talk to James?

21:38.400 --> 21:42.360
He says they'll lift the suspension
right after the hearing.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.120
Which is in ten days.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.800
I'll have lost everything
I've built up by then.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.880
All my clients.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.240

All of it legal.

All tax avoidance.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.960
And we need to know
every twist and turn

22:23.960 --> 22:27.280
and inside track and rat run
if we're going to catch him.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.600
Like a car chase, Josh.
Only better.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.520
I'll just stick to the tech.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.560
Yeah.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.480
This will take months, Nora.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.360
I just need to get enough
to get Brannigan back in here

22:40.360 --> 22:41.720
and crack him.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.840
And what we're looking for
is in here somewhere.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.680
And what exactly
are we looking for?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.800
A pattern, maybe? Gaps? A mistake.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.520
All this is just surface.
Squeaky clean and perfect.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.960
We need to understand

22:54.960 --> 22:58.280
why would a man with a corporate
structure this sophisticated

22:58.280 --> 23:00.760
be stashing
or dealing uncut diamonds?

23:00.760 --> 23:02.000

32:56.760 --> 32:59.240
Just hang on a minute.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.840
Fuck!

33:12.040 --> 33:14.320
She's heading
to the Strand Hotel, Emer.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.760
That's where he was going yesterday.
At that restaurant.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.400
EMER: I'm not far.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.720
FIONN: He's behind you
in a grey estate.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.840
Can you see him?No.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.640
Look again.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.680
Shit!

33:39.880 --> 33:41.920
Security desk, how can I help you?

33:44.680 --> 33:47.040
Just a moment, sir. Come on! Lift.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.640
Yeah, I see him.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.520
You don't have to do it, Siobhan.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.280
I can do it.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.200
There's enough time.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.320
Siobhan!I can do it.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.400
All right. Burn the document.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.240
Sorry for the inconvenience.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.000
Have a nice day!

34:24.240 --> 34:26.400

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400

EMER: I'm at the hotel.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.840
You stay with Fionn
and call for back up.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.640
I'm going in. Keep an eye out for
anyone coming or going.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.120
They have to be meeting someone.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.000
What is it, Mrs Brannigan?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.800
It must be something very important.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.120
Get security to not let anyone
leave the building.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.480
Yes, Ma'am!

Fuck!

36:35.280 --> 36:36.800
You'd be wise to tell me.

36:36.800 --> 36:40.160
Cos if you think I'm his problem,
you're both very stupid.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.760
Thank you for doing this!

36:55.760 --> 36:57.040
Glad to.

"the property described
in the schedule

37:37.960 --> 37:42.240
"and in trust for Fionn Brannigan,

37:53.440 --> 37:55.680
EMER: Do you even know
who you're married to?

37:57.040 --> 38:00.000
Your husband owned an apartment
in Antwerp, Mrs Brannigan,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.640
where a bomb was made
that killed 14 people.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.760
You still have nothing to tell us?

38:05.800 --> 38:08.400
Where is he? Who took him?

38:08.400 --> 38:10.520
Before 14 more people are killed.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.280
A bomb?

38:16.440 --> 38:18.680
You need to tell me
what you do know.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.480
Hmm...

38:26.480 --> 38:29.840
He told me to take him
to the restaurant.

38:32.800 --> 38:36.200
There was a man there waiting
in a car to get him away.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.160
It was pretty dark
in the car park and...

38:44.160 --> 38:46.000
..fast.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.480
But it was silver.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.840
A silver Toyota, I think it was.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.720
What did he look like?

38:56.560 --> 38:58.880
About 40.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.960
Dark hair.

39:00.960 --> 39:05.560
Oh, and a wedding ring.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.600
That's all.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.360
Then what?

39:09.360 --> 39:11.120
Fionn got in the back seat.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.680
And told the guy
to give me the envelope.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.640
Told me to get rid of it.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.040
To go inside and...

39:23.040 --> 39:25.720
Why not destroy it in the car park?

39:25.720 --> 39:27.200
CCTV.

39:29.480 --> 39:33.120
It was the driver's idea
to go into the men's.

39:33.120 --> 39:37.160
And...anyone following
would look there last

39:37.160 --> 39:39.040
and it would buy me some time.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.200
Nearly worked.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.840
Did Fionn know him?

39:47.960 --> 39:49.400
Maybe.

39:50.440 --> 39:51.960
I don't know, they just...

39:51.960 --> 39:53.280
They just took off.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.920
Recess.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.680

this silver Toyota story?

40:09.680 --> 40:11.440
Not a Toyota.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.240
The car park CCTV caught
a silver Audi exiting.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.760
But the footage is so grainy,
I can't make it out.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.680
You'd have gotten better
pictures from Mars.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.000
I'm trying to locate
any Audis coming in.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.360
See if we can get a better view
of who's driving.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.120
Emer, I'm so sorry.

40:28.240 --> 40:32.120
You wouldn't have lost him today
if I hadn't lost him yesterday.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.280
Do me a favour and
process his wife. Let her go.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.320
I can't bear to see Joe Galvin
gloating at me again.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.880
All right.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.680
There'll be a hearing.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.680
Probably early, so get some sleep.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.800
I need to use your phone.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.880
I need to use it now.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.280
There's one in the
glove compartment.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.440
You have two minutes, Siobhan.

that apartment.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.400
Did you know what it was
being used for?

41:40.400 --> 41:42.680
No, Siobhan. No.
Not until yesterday.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.800
I had no idea, I promise.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.480
I believe you.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.800
The CAB woman says you're not safe.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.680
I'm safe.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.440
How?

41:58.440 --> 42:01.760
I'm handing myself in.
To the police.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.320
What?

42:03.320 --> 42:05.240
If they have that document now,

42:05.240 --> 42:07.120
there's nothing else I can do
anyway.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.960
Just come back.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.440
Siobhan... The hard drive.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.520
They didn't get it.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.600

He didn't sound good.
When does he ever?

I have to go.
No, Bibi. You really don't.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.560
He's a person of interest
in a criminal investigation.

Yes?

A small contingent.

I wanted to tell you in person
