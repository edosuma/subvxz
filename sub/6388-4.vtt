on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.085 --> 00:04.086
I will love you
till the end of time,

00:04.120 --> 00:05.821
but I can no longer be
your husband.

00:05.856 --> 00:08.490
- It's such a fucking relief!
- I know, right?

00:08.525 --> 00:10.125
It's fucking liberating!

00:10.160 --> 00:12.795
- I'm dropping out of school.
- Oh, no, you're not.

00:12.829 --> 00:14.997
- I want to be a writer.
- Why?

00:15.031 --> 00:16.432
Being a writer sucks.

00:16.466 --> 00:18.601
I really thought
you'd be more supportive.

00:18.635 --> 00:20.569
I want an agent
who understands

00:20.604 --> 00:21.737
what I'm going through,

00:21.771 --> 00:24.073
both as an artist
and as a gay man.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.774
I want a gay-gent.

00:25.809 --> 00:27.977
We were in such
a great place that night.

00:28.011 --> 00:31.046
And if we stand any chance
of getting back there,

00:31.081 --> 00:33.048
you have to pull
your shit together.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.317
Well, I really
loved your book, Ophelia.

00:35.352 --> 00:37.052
Good for you, Marcy.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.555
You don't need a man
to be happy.

00:39.589 --> 00:40.823
Did you sign Robbie Mac?

00:40.857 --> 00:43.259
Yeah, I wasn't sure
if it was gonna stick.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.427
Well, it stuck, all right.
It's on deadline.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.130
Do you know that fucker?

00:48.164 --> 00:50.733
This fucker is supposed
to be in rehab right now!

00:50.767 --> 00:54.069
It appears
that I have had a relapse.

00:54.104 --> 00:57.139
I got to get myself
back to rehab posthaste.

00:57.173 --> 00:59.508
Do you think maybe
you can give me a ride?

Here's to your
semi-successful rehab stint.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.321
Cheers.

01:12.355 --> 01:14.089
And here's
to my cock-happy gay-gent.

01:14.124 --> 01:15.157
Mm!

01:15.191 --> 01:16.625
It's a better life, Hank.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.594
The gays--
they got it all figured out,

01:18.628 --> 01:20.529
especially
when it comes to sex.

01:20.563 --> 01:22.965
They want to get laid,
they just do it.

01:22.999 --> 01:26.468
They act on their impulses--
no guilt, no shame.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.470
Heterosexuality should get down
on bended knee

01:28.505 --> 01:29.738
and take a lesson.

01:29.773 --> 01:31.340
I'll bring it up
at the next board meeting.

01:31.374 --> 01:33.475
It's good to have
you back, buddy!

01:33.510 --> 01:34.710
It's good to be back.

01:34.744 --> 01:36.312
So...

01:36.346 --> 01:37.579
What's next?

01:37.614 --> 01:38.981
Well, I got
something in mind.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.783
I-I don't know
if it's a novel.

01:40.817 --> 01:42.284
I don't know
if it's a short story.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.319
It's definitely
a character.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.753
I met this woman
in rehab--

01:44.788 --> 01:46.755
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that all sounds great, but--

01:46.790 --> 01:48.691
Mm? Yep, yep, yep.
You see it coming.

01:48.725 --> 01:50.693
I got an offer for you!

01:50.727 --> 01:52.962
And I pass.

01:52.996 --> 01:54.196
- What, you pass?
- Yeah.

01:54.230 --> 01:55.531
- What the fuck?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.565 --> 01:58.600
I'm gonna write on spec
for a while, Charlie, okay?

01:58.635 --> 02:00.936
No Hollywood fingers
in my sweet, little cornhole.

02:00.971 --> 02:02.338
Why would
you want to work for free

02:02.372 --> 02:04.206
when I can get you
a major payday?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.674
Don't you need one?
Um...

02:05.709 --> 02:07.776
You just dropped major
fucking ducats on rehab.

02:07.811 --> 02:09.277
Well, yeah, sure,
paydays are always nice.

02:09.312 --> 02:10.279
Yeah, yeah.

02:10.312 --> 02:11.780
What if it was
a quick assignment?

02:11.815 --> 02:12.948
Yeah, well,
they never are.

02:12.983 --> 02:15.117
What if it was a remake
of <i>Cruising?</i>

02:15.151 --> 02:18.620
Come on, Billy Friedkin,
Al Pacino.

02:18.655 --> 02:19.989
And so it begins.

02:20.023 --> 02:21.824
I got it all cued up for you
right here, okay?

02:21.858 --> 02:23.625
- Charlie--
- Look, no, no, no, no.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.795
You just need to sit down
and relax, hmm?

02:26.830 --> 02:30.299
I got the popcorn.
I got the red vines.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.101
Charlie, I don't feel like
screening a movie with you

02:32.135 --> 02:33.469
right now.

02:33.503 --> 02:35.404
I want to go see Karen, check up
on the state of our union.

02:35.438 --> 02:37.139
Well, you got homework
to do, man.

02:37.173 --> 02:40.075
We got ourselves a big
Hollywood meeting tomorrow.

It's gonna be amazing, Hank.
Nothing to be nervous about.

03:31.858 --> 03:33.659
- I'm not nervous.
- Good.

03:33.693 --> 03:35.795
- Are you?
- No, no, no.

03:35.829 --> 03:37.663
Totally sanguine.
I'm the sanguinator.

03:37.697 --> 03:39.265
Mm, well, you're sweating

03:39.299 --> 03:40.966
through that cheap,
ugly suit of yours.

03:41.001 --> 03:42.468
I know, I know, I know.

03:42.502 --> 03:44.236
Hank, this could
be such a big meeting,

03:44.271 --> 03:45.704
and I can't get Robbie
on the phone.

03:45.739 --> 03:47.606
He's supposed to be here.
I'm sure it's fine.

03:47.641 --> 03:49.241
I'm sure he's just out
somewhere, you know--

03:49.276 --> 03:52.078
- Sucking a dick somewhere.
- Whoa, jeez, Charlie.

03:52.112 --> 03:54.847
That's a little...something,
don't you think?

03:54.881 --> 03:57.716
Hank, the guy sucks a whole
bag of dicks before breakfast.

03:57.751 --> 04:00.219
A whole bag?
That's a lot of protein.

04:00.253 --> 04:01.620
I hope he eats
a light breakfast.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.122
Or maybe throw
some veggies in there.

04:03.156 --> 04:04.423
I'm not nervous.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.559
Ali's a huge fan.
Ali?

04:06.593 --> 04:08.727
- Yeah. Ali Andrews.
- Charlie--

04:08.762 --> 04:10.262
She's a huge fan of yours
in particular.

04:10.297 --> 04:11.964
Charlie, Ali Andrews
was the executive

04:11.998 --> 04:13.265
on <i>Crazy Little Thing</i>
<i>Called Love.</i>

04:13.300 --> 04:15.768
She came on to me.
I rebuffed her advances.

04:15.802 --> 04:17.636
She fired me,
had me rewritten.

04:17.671 --> 04:19.904
Any of this sound familiar?

04:19.940 --> 04:21.072
Vaguely.

04:21.108 --> 04:22.875
Charlie, how the fuck
do you forget this shit?

04:22.909 --> 04:24.243
It's all coming back
to me now.

04:24.277 --> 04:25.911
Because you've burned
a lot of bridges, Hank.

04:25.946 --> 04:28.647
All the people you've pissed
off--they move around a lot.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.416
Hank, she's running
the studio now.

04:33.453 --> 04:34.920
Charlie.

04:34.955 --> 04:35.921
Hank.

04:35.956 --> 04:36.922
Ali.

04:36.957 --> 04:39.758
So lovely to see you.
Come on in.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.060
Ali Andrews...

04:41.094 --> 04:43.162
One of the most successful women
in Hollywood.

04:43.196 --> 04:46.132
Lucky 7 on the 30 under 30--
congrats on that.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.667
- Where's your client, Charlie?
- Oh, he'll be here any minute.

04:48.702 --> 04:50.736
You all are in
for a real treat too.

04:50.770 --> 04:53.839
He is stunningly handsome.
Well, he's a movie star.

04:53.874 --> 04:56.142
Of course he's stunning.
But is he clean?

04:56.176 --> 04:57.376
Immaculate.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.044
He's so clean,
you could eat off of him.

04:59.079 --> 05:01.514
Yeah, I heard that
was your thing now, right?

05:01.548 --> 05:04.750
I always had a feeling.
Me too.

05:04.784 --> 05:08.120
So, Hank, tell me a story.

05:08.155 --> 05:09.555
You've seen
the original movie?

05:09.589 --> 05:11.056
- I have. It's brilliant.
- "Brilliant."

05:11.091 --> 05:13.259
Why is everything always
"brilliant" with you people?

05:13.293 --> 05:15.628
Why can't anything be
just good or okay?

05:15.662 --> 05:18.063
But I-I-I digress.

05:18.098 --> 05:20.833
You've seen the original.
That's my story.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.568
Well, how do you plan
to update it?

05:22.602 --> 05:24.069
I mean, what's your take?
My take?

05:24.104 --> 05:26.572
My take is I'll take it.
I'll take it and make it my own.

05:28.341 --> 05:29.675
Oh, oh, I-I get it.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.510
You know, story's really
never been your thing, right?

05:31.545 --> 05:34.680
You're all about voice
and attitude,

05:34.714 --> 05:37.850
lots of talk,
no action.

05:37.884 --> 05:39.585
Oh, okay.

05:39.619 --> 05:41.587
So we both know
what this is about.

05:41.621 --> 05:43.255
- We do?
- Yes.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.257
And if you're still wanting
to make shit happen,

05:45.292 --> 05:46.759
I'm down with it.
You're kidding me.

05:46.793 --> 05:49.428
I was in a loving, monogamous
relationship at the time.

05:49.462 --> 05:50.596
Now not so much.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.997
I mean, it's still loving,

05:52.032 --> 05:53.699
but we can't seem to get back
on the physical plane,

05:53.733 --> 05:56.268
which sucks, but it does afford
me certain freedoms.

05:56.303 --> 05:58.604
I wish you were this
imaginative in your writing.

05:58.638 --> 06:01.207
I think it would clear
the air, right?

06:01.241 --> 06:03.042
I mean, you're obviously
a woman that's used to getting

06:03.076 --> 06:04.777
what she wants, you know.

06:04.811 --> 06:06.545
And I'm the guy
that said "no, thanks"

06:06.580 --> 06:07.846
to your fleshy goodness,

06:07.881 --> 06:09.682
which makes me the one
that got away.

06:09.716 --> 06:11.617
So you've put me up
on this pedestal

06:11.651 --> 06:13.886
built of bitterness and regret.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.555
This is exciting, hmm?

06:16.590 --> 06:18.557
The sexual tension--
it's--it's thick.

06:18.592 --> 06:20.593
I mean, you could--you could cut
it with a knife

06:20.627 --> 06:22.394
and spread it
on some crostini.

06:22.429 --> 06:24.396
Why don't you two get the fuck
out of my office?

06:24.431 --> 06:26.265
I have a studio to run.

06:30.103 --> 06:33.539
Who wants to remake a classic
fucking movie from the '70s?

06:33.573 --> 06:35.975
It came out in '80,
actually.

06:36.009 --> 06:38.744
Ow.
Quiet, writer.

06:38.778 --> 06:41.580
A man who shall remain nameless.

06:41.615 --> 06:44.416
Came out recently.

06:44.451 --> 06:49.521
He came out in a big,
brave, showy way.

06:52.225 --> 06:54.526
Then he brought me this movie.

06:54.561 --> 06:56.495
Now, at first, I thought,

06:56.529 --> 06:58.764
"who gives a fuck
about anonymous gay men

06:58.798 --> 07:03.035
punishing each other's assholes
in dark, dank leather bars?"

07:03.069 --> 07:06.405
Then I thought,
"this guy does."

07:06.439 --> 07:10.376
Three months
in dingy gay bars,

07:10.410 --> 07:12.244
and I get paid for it too?

07:16.049 --> 07:18.584
So what do you say,
handsome?

07:18.618 --> 07:21.020
You seen the original?
Oh, yes.

07:21.054 --> 07:22.688
Fucking brilliant!

07:22.722 --> 07:24.556
Turn that shit up.

Settle down, Judy Garland.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.637
You guys
should come celebrate tonight.

08:11.671 --> 08:12.738
Fist--

08:12.772 --> 08:14.440
Santa Monica and Robertson,
be there.

08:14.474 --> 08:16.041
Oh, you're going to fist.

08:16.076 --> 08:17.543
I got a thing over
at prolapsed rectum.

08:17.577 --> 08:20.045
You know, it's in Silver Lake.
Be there, writer...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.648
or be off the project.
He will be there, Robbie.

08:22.682 --> 08:23.982
Sure thing.

08:24.017 --> 08:26.452
Just got to get my assless chaps
out of storage.

08:34.361 --> 08:36.328
He is something, ain't he?

08:36.363 --> 08:37.529
You better be careful,

08:37.563 --> 08:39.365
or else some part of him
is gonna end up

08:39.399 --> 08:40.599
in some part of you.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.267
Why you want to rain
on my gay parade?

08:42.302 --> 08:43.802
Oh, it's gonna rain, Charlie.

08:43.837 --> 08:45.104
It's gonna rain big buckets

08:45.138 --> 08:47.206
of smooth, creamy
man-cake batter.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.341
I hope you have your umbrella.

08:49.376 --> 08:52.177
Gosh, Marcy, thank you
so much for fitting me in.

08:52.212 --> 08:53.612
Are you kidding me?

08:53.646 --> 08:55.981
This is my pure pleasure.

08:56.015 --> 08:58.984
And by the way, this rip's
on the house--my treat.

08:59.018 --> 09:00.052
Oh!

09:00.086 --> 09:02.388
Don't be ridiculous.

09:02.422 --> 09:04.623
- You come highly recommended.
- That's nice.

09:04.657 --> 09:06.625
I mean, I am the shit
when it comes

09:06.659 --> 09:07.993
to making pussies pretty,

09:08.027 --> 09:12.231
but, uh, your writing
means too much to me.

09:12.265 --> 09:14.233
This shit is gratis.

09:14.267 --> 09:16.502
Thank you,
that's very sweet.

09:16.536 --> 09:20.005
Can I tell you something?

09:20.039 --> 09:22.708
And trust me,
it's gonna sound freaky.

09:22.742 --> 09:24.042
Ow!

09:24.077 --> 09:26.512
You can tell me anything.

09:26.546 --> 09:30.182
Okay, I've seen a lot of vajay
in my day,

09:30.216 --> 09:33.652
but yours is simply stunning.

09:33.686 --> 09:36.021
I mean, it took me a while
to hack through all this brush,

09:36.055 --> 09:38.490
but once I got there, wow.

09:38.525 --> 09:39.992
Thank you.

09:40.026 --> 09:42.194
Honestly,
it's like it's glowing.

09:42.228 --> 09:44.096
- You know what it is?
- No.

09:44.130 --> 09:47.533
But please tell me, because mine
looks like day-old deli meat.

09:47.567 --> 09:50.068
It is untouched by man.

09:50.103 --> 09:54.106
But...I mean, do you--
how do you--did you--

09:54.140 --> 09:56.341
Oh--what? Oh, how do
I take care of myself?

09:56.376 --> 09:59.044
Marcy, I do exactly that.

09:59.078 --> 10:00.446
I take care of myself.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.581
I don't need a fucking man
to make me come.

10:02.615 --> 10:04.550
I come all the time.

10:04.584 --> 10:06.685
I just came right now.

10:06.719 --> 10:10.422
- Seriously, you just did?
- No, I'm just kidding.

10:10.457 --> 10:12.391
But I found a better way.

10:12.425 --> 10:14.693
If you withhold,
you gain power.

10:16.763 --> 10:18.931
That is some heady shit,
Ophelia.

10:18.965 --> 10:22.401
So, instead of putting my head
in some man's lap,

10:22.435 --> 10:25.404
I put my nose in a book,
and I never looked up.

10:25.438 --> 10:28.907
And guess what.
All my dreams came true.

10:28.942 --> 10:32.144
Are you sure you don't
just like munching box?

10:32.178 --> 10:35.747
I love women,
but not like that.

10:35.782 --> 10:37.082
I'd rather be alone,

10:37.116 --> 10:40.252
alone with my first editions
and my hummus.

10:40.286 --> 10:41.320
I love hummus.

10:41.354 --> 10:42.554
What about children?

10:42.589 --> 10:44.790
Ugh, disgusting
little creatures.

10:44.824 --> 10:46.658
Church.

10:51.331 --> 10:55.000
♪

10:55.034 --> 10:57.202
Oh, boy!

10:57.237 --> 10:59.872
All right, one drink, Hank.
That's it, I promise.

10:59.906 --> 11:01.306
I can stay all night.

11:01.341 --> 11:04.843
I feel like "Indiana Jones and
the Temple of the Greased Fist."

11:04.878 --> 11:06.979
- Runkle!
- Aah!

11:07.013 --> 11:08.614
Some people
I want you to meet!

11:08.648 --> 11:09.815
Going in!

11:09.849 --> 11:13.018
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

11:14.754 --> 11:16.688
What are you drinking?

11:19.392 --> 11:20.859
- Batesy!
- Hank!

11:20.894 --> 11:22.361
What the fuck
are you doing here?

11:22.395 --> 11:23.896
What does it look
like I'm doing?

11:23.930 --> 11:25.631
Research--got a new book
in the works.

11:25.665 --> 11:28.901
Question is, what are
you doing here, kitten?

11:28.935 --> 11:31.470
- Oh, Charlie's gay now.
- Now?

11:31.504 --> 11:33.824
Let me tell you something,
that scrumptious little macaroon

11:33.840 --> 11:35.274
was born with balls
on his chin.

11:36.376 --> 11:38.243
- How's Karen?
- She's good.

11:38.278 --> 11:40.512
She's shacking up
with Marcy...

11:40.547 --> 11:41.647
Not in that way.

11:41.681 --> 11:42.915
Well, I'm confused.

11:42.949 --> 11:45.117
Why is she not shacked up
with you in that way?

11:45.151 --> 11:46.418
I'm equally confused.

11:46.452 --> 11:49.488
I guess we're just heroes
of bad timing.

11:49.522 --> 11:51.023
Hey, you going
to Becca's thing tonight?

11:51.057 --> 11:52.224
What Becca's thing?

11:52.258 --> 11:53.926
How do you know
about Becca's thing tonight?

11:53.960 --> 11:55.160
We keep in touch.

11:55.194 --> 11:56.828
She's always asking me questions
about writing.

11:56.863 --> 11:59.264
She's so cute.
She's fantastic, Hank.

11:59.299 --> 12:02.000
Huh. She never asks me
questions about writing.

12:02.035 --> 12:04.069
Well, that could be one
of two things.

12:04.103 --> 12:06.138
Either she recognizes
who the real writer is,

12:06.172 --> 12:08.640
or she's not ready
to let you in yet, Hank.

12:08.675 --> 12:10.342
Come on, it's got to be tough
on the poor gal.

12:10.376 --> 12:11.910
She wants to be a writer.

12:11.945 --> 12:14.079
Her dad's, you know,
reasonably good at it.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.114
"Reasonably"?

12:16.149 --> 12:17.883
It's okay.
You're still young.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.685
If you want to be one
of the greats,

12:19.719 --> 12:21.453
you're gonna have to park
your ass in that chair

12:21.487 --> 12:23.422
and bleed on the motherfucker.

12:23.456 --> 12:24.723
Thanks
for the gross tip, Prof.

12:24.757 --> 12:25.958
Okay.

12:25.992 --> 12:27.659
Listen, I got to go.
I got to get back to work.

12:27.694 --> 12:30.162
Got a lot of thirsty boys.
You're a good man, Gunga Din.

12:30.196 --> 12:32.898
- Yes, tipping is permitted.
- Oh, really?

12:32.932 --> 12:35.500
Take your time, sugar.

12:35.535 --> 12:37.102
There he is.

12:37.136 --> 12:39.104
Abbott's habit--
it's in Venice.

12:39.138 --> 12:40.872
I think she goes on
around 11:00 or so.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.374
Thanks, Batesy.

12:42.408 --> 12:44.910
Hey, writer.

12:44.944 --> 12:46.845
Oh, wow.

12:46.879 --> 12:48.914
Wait a minute.
Hmm.

12:48.948 --> 12:50.415
Oh, you're real.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.085
I thought you were a mirage,
but you smell of perfume--

12:53.119 --> 12:54.686
lady-ness.
- Mm.

12:54.721 --> 12:57.589
- What are you doing here?
- Robbie invited us...

12:57.624 --> 12:59.958
To celebrate.
Hey, hey, hey, everybody.

12:59.993 --> 13:02.027
Big, gay party at Runkle's!

13:03.563 --> 13:04.963
Let's go!

13:09.602 --> 13:11.703
Come on, hop on, Runkle.
You're coming with me.

13:11.738 --> 13:14.439
Wrap your legs around
this steel, bitch--let's go.

13:14.474 --> 13:16.475
Get on it.

13:16.509 --> 13:18.710
Yes.

13:25.918 --> 13:27.519
- You're wrong, Karen.
- What?

13:27.553 --> 13:31.189
You're wrong.
Men are the enemy.

13:31.224 --> 13:32.724
"Menemy" mine.

13:32.759 --> 13:33.792
"Menenemy."

13:33.826 --> 13:35.427
"Menemy" mine!

13:35.461 --> 13:36.628
Oh, I like that.

13:36.663 --> 13:39.665
That is good, Marcy.
Yes, I love that.

13:39.699 --> 13:41.767
That is the title
of my next book.

13:41.801 --> 13:42.768
Thank you.

13:42.802 --> 13:44.536
Uh...
Thank you.

13:44.570 --> 13:47.272
Um,<i>The Menemy,</i>
my Ophelia Robins.

13:47.306 --> 13:49.708
How men devastate your vagina

13:49.742 --> 13:52.644
and suck out
your will to live.

13:52.679 --> 13:53.812
Jesus.

13:53.846 --> 13:55.814
Catchy.

13:55.848 --> 13:57.749
You think
my utter hatred of men

13:57.784 --> 13:59.184
is very extreme,
don't you?

13:59.218 --> 14:00.185
- Uh...
- I don't.

14:00.219 --> 14:01.987
I do.
Yeah, I do.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.722
Well, let me
ask you this, Karen.

14:03.756 --> 14:06.658
Where exactly has
the princess myth gotten you?

14:06.693 --> 14:09.161
Because as far as I can tell,
everyone you've been with

14:09.195 --> 14:10.562
has grown tired of fucking you

14:10.596 --> 14:13.765
and wandered off into the tits
and pussy of someone else.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.400
Not Bill.

14:15.435 --> 14:17.969
You got tired of boning Bill,
and you went back to Hank,

14:18.004 --> 14:19.538
and then Bates got
all chicken hawk on you.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.306
Okay, okay,
you don't need to, like--

14:21.340 --> 14:23.141
I was just getting
the history straight.

14:23.176 --> 14:26.011
Karen, you have got to work
on yourself.

14:26.045 --> 14:27.979
You need to just get away

14:28.014 --> 14:31.149
from this fairy-tale,
happy-ending fantasy

14:31.184 --> 14:32.851
and focus on the now.

14:32.885 --> 14:34.286
I mean, who are you?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.787
What makes you happy?

14:35.822 --> 14:38.523
That's what I'm doing
right now--that is it.

14:38.558 --> 14:40.926
No, you're not.
You're fighting me.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.662
You're a sophisticated,
intelligent woman.

14:43.696 --> 14:47.399
Why have you spent
so much time with boys?

14:47.433 --> 14:49.835
Boys are fun.

14:49.869 --> 14:51.670
Were you molested
as a child?

14:51.704 --> 14:53.138
- No.
- You know what?

14:53.172 --> 14:56.808
Seriously, I was.
I think I was.

14:56.843 --> 14:59.778
My crazy Uncle Andy used to walk
around the house bottomless

14:59.812 --> 15:01.246
when he babysat us.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.048
Is that--does that count?

15:03.082 --> 15:06.518
Yes, of course
it counts, Marcy.

15:06.552 --> 15:09.621
The penis is not only
a disgusting appendage,

15:09.655 --> 15:12.157
it is also
a deadly weapon.

15:12.191 --> 15:14.659
And in my new book,
the one you just titled,

15:14.694 --> 15:17.195
I advocate the use
of a cock cage.

15:17.230 --> 15:20.565
It's like
a male chastity device.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.468
And I honestly--
I really think it should be...

15:23.503 --> 15:25.403
What is that?
We didn't order those.

15:25.438 --> 15:27.906
These are courtesy
of the gentlemen over there.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.941
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Oh, snap.

15:29.976 --> 15:31.743
- Oh, how dare they?
- Thank you.

15:31.778 --> 15:33.445
Still got it.

15:33.479 --> 15:35.981
- Ladies...
- Hi.

15:36.015 --> 15:37.315
Hey.

15:37.350 --> 15:38.416
Hello, boys.

15:38.451 --> 15:40.552
Yes, we are ladies.

15:40.586 --> 15:42.354
And, uh, we appreciate
your interest,

15:42.388 --> 15:44.589
but this overture
was ill-conceived

15:44.624 --> 15:46.491
and amateurishly executed.

15:46.526 --> 15:48.426
So, if you buy us
enough of these,

15:48.461 --> 15:50.295
then we're just supposed
to spread our legs

15:50.329 --> 15:52.264
and suck your dirty cocks.

15:52.298 --> 15:54.132
Is that the deal?
That's the deal, right?

15:54.167 --> 15:55.801
That's the implied contract.

15:55.835 --> 15:57.369
Well, that wouldn't be
the worst way

15:57.403 --> 16:00.005
to end an evening, would it?

16:00.039 --> 16:01.807
Well, um, I guess not.

16:01.841 --> 16:04.442
But, uh, what about
the morning after,

16:04.477 --> 16:06.878
when we, uh, wake up
with savage morning breath

16:06.913 --> 16:10.448
and really bad gas from all
this beautiful stinky cheese?

16:10.483 --> 16:13.685
Will your morning wood last
through our explosive diarrhea?

16:13.719 --> 16:18.390
Will your love see us through
our hormonal fluctuations,

16:18.424 --> 16:21.126
perimenopause,
and total ovarian shutdown?

16:21.160 --> 16:23.562
Because we're women, guys.

16:23.596 --> 16:25.230
And we fucking age.

16:25.264 --> 16:28.266
We don't remain eager
little fuck toys forever.

16:28.301 --> 16:30.268
So how about it?

16:30.303 --> 16:31.903
You still want to buy us
a drink?

16:31.938 --> 16:33.605
What do you mean no?

16:33.639 --> 16:35.307
Was it something I said?
What happened?

16:35.341 --> 16:38.410
You don't--
can I have your number?

16:38.444 --> 16:40.078
What, you going
back to your mommies?

16:40.112 --> 16:41.646
You fucking infants.

16:41.681 --> 16:44.916
- That was incredible, Marcy.
- Ay.

16:44.951 --> 16:47.619
You just took ownership
of your she-ness.

16:47.653 --> 16:48.653
Sweating.

16:48.688 --> 16:50.021
- That was just--oh!
- Thank you.

16:50.056 --> 16:51.857
- That's not even a word.
- Thank you.

16:51.891 --> 16:54.492
It is a word. It was the title
of my first book.

16:54.527 --> 16:57.629
All right,
who is up for dessert?

17:00.666 --> 17:03.602
♪

17:03.636 --> 17:06.070
Rachel has a big crush
on Charlie.

17:06.105 --> 17:09.708
- Why?
- He's cute.

17:09.742 --> 17:12.210
You know, he is cute.

17:12.244 --> 17:13.845
I give the guy
a lot of shit,

17:13.880 --> 17:15.547
but he's pretty
fucking adorable,

17:15.580 --> 17:19.050
you know, in a walking
life-size penis kind of a way,

17:19.085 --> 17:20.886
like a pez dispenser.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.654
It's too bad
he's a 'mo.

17:22.688 --> 17:24.489
Oh, he's no 'mo.

17:24.522 --> 17:25.924
- He's not?
- Mm-mm.

17:25.958 --> 17:26.992
No, he's just pretending.

17:27.026 --> 17:28.526
He wanted to sign
the Mac Attack.

17:28.560 --> 17:32.430
The man does what he has to do.
He's a fucking closer--my boy.

17:32.465 --> 17:34.099
You should go up to him
and tell him you dig his steeze.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.233
Yeah, he'll be so chuffed,

17:35.268 --> 17:36.668
he'll probably come
in his pants.

17:36.702 --> 17:38.069
You should stand back
a few feet.

17:38.104 --> 17:39.537
Seriously, keep your hands up.

17:39.572 --> 17:42.073
- Charlie, I want to thank you.
- You are welcome.

17:42.108 --> 17:43.408
I was coming out of rehab,

17:43.442 --> 17:45.377
and you took me
into your loving arms.

17:45.411 --> 17:48.213
I've never felt so protected.
That's what I do, Robbie.

17:48.247 --> 17:50.048
I'm so glad
I let you service me.

17:50.082 --> 17:53.518
I'm happy
to be servicing you.

17:53.552 --> 17:55.620
I think
we should make love.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.722
Yeewhat?

17:57.757 --> 17:59.190
We should fuck...

17:59.225 --> 18:01.693
Once at the very least.

18:01.727 --> 18:04.629
- Why?
- Because there's tension here.

18:04.664 --> 18:06.531
You're obviously
attracted to me,

18:06.565 --> 18:09.034
and while I'm not
physically attracted to you,

18:09.068 --> 18:10.969
I do feel enormously grateful,

18:11.003 --> 18:14.372
which can be even hotter
sometimes.

18:14.407 --> 18:16.374
I think you should blow me
for a while,

18:16.409 --> 18:18.376
and then I could finish up
in that cute, little doughy butt

18:18.411 --> 18:19.544
of yours.

18:19.578 --> 18:20.545
What do you say?

18:20.579 --> 18:22.280
No...

18:22.315 --> 18:24.049
Think about it.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.985
I'll be back.

18:29.956 --> 18:31.389
Charlie...

18:31.424 --> 18:33.258
I know your secret, Charlie.

18:33.292 --> 18:34.626
You do?

18:34.660 --> 18:37.996
- I know you're just pretending.
- I am?

18:38.030 --> 18:40.231
I am.
Yeah.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.833
I just wanted you to know

18:41.867 --> 18:44.936
that I have always
had a crush on you.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.705
I temped on your desk
years back,

18:46.739 --> 18:48.340
and I thought
about telling you,

18:48.374 --> 18:51.142
but then you got fired
for the masturbation video,

18:51.177 --> 18:53.812
and I missed my chance.

18:53.846 --> 18:57.849
If you have a moment,
I'd love to suck your dick.

18:59.952 --> 19:01.686
Why did you even do
the movie?

19:01.721 --> 19:03.355
It was such an epic
piece of shit.

19:04.890 --> 19:07.292
<i>Crazy Little Thing</i> made close
to $300 million worldwide.

19:07.326 --> 19:09.961
It cost 50.
It made my fucking career.

19:09.996 --> 19:11.262
And it tainted mine.

19:11.297 --> 19:13.031
Oh, please, you tainted
your own career.

19:13.065 --> 19:15.367
You're incredibly
difficult to work with.

19:15.401 --> 19:16.835
Yeah, right.
'Cause I wouldn't put out?

19:16.869 --> 19:18.336
Yeah,
I don't even remember this

19:18.371 --> 19:20.091
little incident
you keep prattling on about.

19:20.106 --> 19:21.506
Oh, bullshit.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.875
We were sitting in your office,
on your couch, just like this.

19:23.909 --> 19:26.978
And you leaned over,
and you smooched me...

19:30.216 --> 19:31.549
Just like that.

19:31.584 --> 19:35.220
And I do believe that you
even put your hand on my leg...

19:35.254 --> 19:37.822
Something like this.
Mm.

19:37.857 --> 19:40.325
- Ring a bell?
- If you say so.

19:40.359 --> 19:43.028
I don't know if it's all
the gay sex talking or not,

19:43.062 --> 19:44.796
but you're looking pretty
fucking good to me right now.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.631
Wow.
Aren't you a charmer?

19:46.665 --> 19:49.667
I still think you're mean,
petty, and vindictive.

19:49.702 --> 19:52.570
But I'm thinking maybe
we should hate-fuck--

19:52.605 --> 19:56.007
you know, get the poison out.
- If you say so.

19:56.042 --> 19:59.144
So you admit it,
you're still into me.

19:59.178 --> 20:02.247
I'm sorry.
I changed my mind.

20:03.883 --> 20:06.751
Uh-uh, fuck you.

20:11.524 --> 20:14.459
Ooh!

20:14.493 --> 20:15.994
Aah!

20:16.028 --> 20:19.164
I am so fucking straight
right now!

20:19.198 --> 20:21.099
Okay.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.600
Oh!

20:22.635 --> 20:25.170
Mammary glands!

20:25.204 --> 20:26.771
Okay, okay, Charlie,
just wait--wait a second.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.075
Charlie, I need to go pee
and put my diaphragm in.

20:30.109 --> 20:31.609
- Awesome!
- Okay.

20:31.644 --> 20:33.311
- You do that!
- Yeah.

20:33.345 --> 20:34.946
You do that.
God!

20:34.980 --> 20:37.382
I love hearing
about all that girly stuff!

20:41.153 --> 20:43.254
Yes?

20:45.324 --> 20:48.660
Yes!

20:48.694 --> 20:52.130
Charlie, are
you ready for me?

20:52.164 --> 20:54.766
Oh, yes, you are.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.902
You got all naked for Robbie.

20:57.937 --> 21:00.071
Here...

21:00.106 --> 21:01.406
Take a look.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.410
That's British steel.
Wow.

21:05.444 --> 21:08.246
That is an impressive rig
you got there, Robbie.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.414
Solid.

21:09.448 --> 21:13.084
Solid cock and balls,
that...

21:13.119 --> 21:15.320
That's some real
movie-star shit right there.

21:15.354 --> 21:17.255
Thanks, Charlie.

21:17.289 --> 21:20.925
You want to wrap your lips
around this piece or what?

21:20.960 --> 21:22.760
Uh...

21:22.795 --> 21:25.330
Well, it's really kind
of you to offer--

21:25.364 --> 21:27.098
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- Ew!

21:27.133 --> 21:29.334
Put some fucking clothes on,
girl--that shit is foul.

21:29.368 --> 21:31.236
Charlie, what the fuck is this?
She came on to me.

21:31.270 --> 21:32.804
She wouldn't take no
for an answer.

21:32.838 --> 21:34.005
She tried to rape me!

21:34.039 --> 21:35.440
I wouldn't touch her
with your dick.

21:35.474 --> 21:37.542
Really, really,
she's disgusting.

21:37.576 --> 21:39.277
You are a fucking asshole!

21:39.311 --> 21:41.980
You know what, Robbie?
He is just pretending to be gay!

21:42.014 --> 21:44.048
I don't believe that
for a second.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.784
Charlie?
No! Fuck, no.

21:46.819 --> 21:49.654
Moment of truth, Charlie.

21:49.688 --> 21:53.124
Open up and say ahh.

21:56.896 --> 21:58.730
I can't!

21:58.764 --> 22:01.733
I got Hep-C?

22:01.767 --> 22:05.103
Guess what, buddy.
Me too.

22:06.405 --> 22:08.406
Come on, let's do this.
Suck that shit.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.576
Okay, but, really,
my bigger concern is,

22:11.610 --> 22:13.344
what is this gonna do

22:13.379 --> 22:15.380
to our professional
relationship?

22:15.414 --> 22:18.983
Oh, I think it's gonna make
things a lot fucking hotter.

22:19.018 --> 22:20.552
Okay.

22:20.586 --> 22:22.353
Would you take a hand job?

22:22.388 --> 22:25.990
I think that there is a party
in your mouth tonight,

22:26.025 --> 22:27.926
Charlie Runkle,

22:27.960 --> 22:30.428
and I'm coming.

22:30.462 --> 22:32.797
Okay. Okay.

22:36.068 --> 22:37.869
Okay!

22:37.903 --> 22:39.737
I can't! I can't!

22:39.772 --> 22:41.773
I'm sorry.
I just--I can't.

22:41.807 --> 22:44.075
I'm--I'm straight
as an arrow.

22:44.109 --> 22:45.610
I'm not perfectly straight.

22:45.644 --> 22:47.745
If I was in prison right now,
I'd probably be a total slut.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.547
But in the real world,

22:49.582 --> 22:52.016
I definitely prefer
the fairer sex.

22:52.051 --> 22:54.385
I'm so sorry.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.887
I'm so sorry.

22:55.921 --> 22:58.756
I just--I'm such a big fan,
and I just--

22:58.791 --> 23:00.225
I got caught up in a lie.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.827
You are a liar and a coward,
Charlie Runkle.

23:02.861 --> 23:05.063
Yes.
Yes, I am.

23:05.097 --> 23:07.599
You know what else you are?

23:09.568 --> 23:13.071
Fired.

23:13.105 --> 23:15.073
See?

23:15.107 --> 23:18.710
I feel the toxins about
to release from my body.

23:18.744 --> 23:20.078
Isn't this much better?

23:20.112 --> 23:24.415
All the resentment is about
to just explode out of me.

23:24.450 --> 23:27.919
We should have done this
years ago.

23:29.288 --> 23:31.823
Your career would probably be
in a lot better shape.

23:31.857 --> 23:33.224
Maybe.
You never know.

23:33.259 --> 23:36.394
I've been quite
the self-saboteur.

23:36.428 --> 23:39.063
- Hank?
- Yes, Charles?

23:39.098 --> 23:42.734
Hank, I've been found out.
The jig is up, Hank.

23:42.768 --> 23:44.102
I've been "inned."

23:44.136 --> 23:45.903
Can you give me
a few minutes?

23:45.938 --> 23:48.406
Just a few?

23:48.440 --> 23:52.043
Oh, listen, lady,
I'm enjoying your whole...this.

23:52.077 --> 23:55.680
But I'm not exactly sure
how I feel about you in general.

23:55.714 --> 23:59.350
You know, you did fire me
and then had me rewritten,

23:59.385 --> 24:01.019
which led
to a nasty chain of events,

24:01.053 --> 24:04.689
which, in turn, led to
a devastating downward spiral.

24:04.723 --> 24:07.859
So don't let the hardness
of Hank Jr. fool you.

24:07.893 --> 24:09.961
Uh, that shit
did not sit well with me.

24:09.995 --> 24:13.197
Would you guys be interested
in a third, by any chance?

24:13.232 --> 24:16.034
I'm fucking horny as hell
right now.

24:20.239 --> 24:24.976
Once a bottom-feeder,
always a bottom-feeder.

24:28.247 --> 24:30.615
Fuck you, Hank.
Hmm.

24:32.284 --> 24:33.985
Should we assume
the deal is off?

24:34.019 --> 24:36.454
Of course
the deal is off, Hank!

24:36.488 --> 24:40.124
And if the deal is off,
I'm fired as fuck right now!

24:44.763 --> 24:47.732
And the thing they never
tell you is how hard it is--

24:47.766 --> 24:51.069
growing up, finding your place
in the world,

24:51.103 --> 24:53.438
accepting your fate.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.807
But if you're lucky,
you have someone in your life

24:55.841 --> 24:57.809
who gets you...

24:57.843 --> 24:59.844
Who accepts you
for who you are...

24:59.878 --> 25:03.781
Who ever so gently nudges you
towards your destiny.

25:03.816 --> 25:06.651
So, yeah,
I guess you could say

25:06.685 --> 25:08.419
I was born to be a writer...

25:08.454 --> 25:09.821
which is weird,

25:09.855 --> 25:13.424
because I definitely wanted
something else for myself...

25:13.459 --> 25:15.259
Something big...

25:15.294 --> 25:16.794
larger than life.

25:16.829 --> 25:20.164
But it's a waste of time,
wanting things,

25:20.199 --> 25:23.301
because sooner or later,
the thing that wants you

25:23.335 --> 25:26.838
is just gonna come up
and tap you on the shoulder.

25:26.872 --> 25:29.507
And you might
want to be ready.

25:40.753 --> 25:44.322
Good evening, ladies.

25:44.356 --> 25:46.257
- Fuck you, Hank.
- What did I do?

25:46.291 --> 25:47.825
- You have a penis.
- Uh-huh.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.560
And she's embracing
her she-ness.

25:49.595 --> 25:50.895
You can't come in.

25:50.929 --> 25:53.698
I like your poetry, woman,
but I don't understand.

25:53.732 --> 25:55.466
You don't need to.
It's okay.

25:55.501 --> 25:56.868
So what's up?
What's up?

25:56.902 --> 25:58.536
I'll tell you what's up.

25:58.570 --> 26:00.304
Our daughter's pretty fucking
talented--that's what's up.

26:00.339 --> 26:01.706
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

26:01.740 --> 26:03.875
You came all this way to tell
me something I already know?

26:03.909 --> 26:06.811
No, I came all this way
to tell you how sorry I am

26:06.845 --> 26:11.482
for my shameful self-indulgence
over the past few months.

26:11.517 --> 26:12.817
It's okay.

26:12.851 --> 26:14.485
You don't owe me
anything, Hank.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.320
I'm just glad
that you're feeling better.

26:16.355 --> 26:18.656
I-I do. I-I feel better.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.024
Mmhmm.

26:20.058 --> 26:22.860
And now that I'm relatively
clean and soberish,

26:22.895 --> 26:26.063
I'm painfully aware
of how we left things.

26:26.098 --> 26:28.466
It's just--I mean, I...

26:28.500 --> 26:30.535
It's all so--
unresolved?

26:30.569 --> 26:32.336
Yes, exactly.

26:32.371 --> 26:34.338
Yes.

26:34.373 --> 26:37.175
It may have to stay
that way for a while.

26:37.209 --> 26:38.342
I figured as much.

26:38.377 --> 26:40.678
But, uh,
we should reconvene again

26:40.712 --> 26:41.813
and talk about this--

26:41.847 --> 26:44.015
the state of our union
and whatnot...

26:44.049 --> 26:45.683
Sometime soon.

26:45.717 --> 26:46.751
Hmm?

26:46.785 --> 26:48.853
- Let's play it by ear.
- Okay, we will.

26:48.887 --> 26:50.521
We'll play it by ear.

26:50.556 --> 26:51.656
But in the meantime,

26:51.690 --> 26:54.025
because of our pure-of-heart
little munchkin

26:54.059 --> 26:55.760
beautiful daughter...
Mmhmm.

26:55.794 --> 26:57.261
I'm going off
to write something.

26:57.296 --> 26:58.963
- You're gonna write something?
- I don't know what it is.

26:58.997 --> 27:00.431
Really?

27:00.466 --> 27:01.966
I'm gonna make
my intentions known, Karen.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.634
Put it down on paper.
Interesting.

27:03.669 --> 27:06.137
- Prepare to be John Woo'd.
- I will.

27:06.171 --> 27:08.473
I'm excited for you.
Good.

27:08.507 --> 27:13.144
And I'm okay with all this.
I'm relatively sanguine.

27:13.178 --> 27:17.815
In fact...
I am the sanguinator.

27:17.850 --> 27:19.817
Goodgood night.

27:23.021 --> 27:23.988
Um...
So...

27:24.022 --> 27:25.490
Good. Okay.

27:25.524 --> 27:29.494
- Till we meet again.
- Mm-hmm.

27:29.528 --> 27:32.163
- Good night, Karen.
- Good night, Hank.
