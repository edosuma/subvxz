00:06.707 --> 00:07.308
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.909 --> 00:10.278
- All I want is
what you have in there.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.412
Is it alive?
- I don't think so.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.347
- Jesus Christ, Katie.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.083
- [over radio]
I need today's code.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.018
- Our contact has been killed,
but, um...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.753
[radio beeps]
- Emergency protocol.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.755
All outlets shift
to signal two immediately.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.592
- The gauntlet's not the only
thing they're looking for.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.328
Their onboard computer had
a bunch of dossier files open.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.662
They're looking for you.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.431
- We have a secure location
in the desert.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.032
- And you can do something
with the gauntlet?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.502
- We have a RAP.
One of them defected.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.370
It doesn't believe in
what the rest of them are doing.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.607
Our RAP just needs the gauntlet
to tap into their communication.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.375
It's the only piece
we're missing.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.444
[gunshots]
[women grunt]

00:43.444 --> 00:44.845
- We've got the target.
Get out of there.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.046
- She can't--she can't be dead.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.315
She never told us
where her base was.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.816
She never told us anything!

00:48.816 --> 00:50.618
- The drones showed up
and opened fire.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.020
One of them came down,
just stared at me.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.288
- That happened to me,

00:54.288 --> 00:55.856
coming back from Santa Monica.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.791
- We just received word
from our Hosts.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.027
The Los Angeles bloc
has been scheduled

01:00.027 --> 01:01.595

Tact.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.721
- It's intact.
Tact.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.257
- The Host unit.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.225
It doesn't look like
it got beat up too bad.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.127
But it's unresponsive.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.228
- Shit.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.463
Its interface is missing.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.298
- Well, that's how we found it.

01:37.298 --> 01:40.334
- Let's pray the core is
salvageable at least.

I know this is
a terrible time to ask,

01:59.753 --> 02:02.890
but what happens
if this doesn't work?

02:02.890 --> 02:05.893
- They'll probably
nuke us from orbit.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.162
- [incredulous laugh]

02:08.162 --> 02:15.169

02:15.169 --> 02:16.537
Can you hear them?

02:19.740 --> 02:22.276
[radio beeps]

02:22.276 --> 02:23.411
- Yeah.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.914
- Do exactly
as they instruct you.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.249
Do not deviate.

02:28.249 --> 02:34.455
*

02:34.455 --> 02:36.457

I'm beginning the procedure.

Anybody reading?
Over.

[radio static]

04:22.763 --> 04:24.097
I have the gauntlet,

04:24.097 --> 04:25.933
but I can't hold onto it
for much longer.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.102
I need to know where you are
so I can deliver it. Over.

Come on, guys.
Give me something.

04:38.178 --> 04:41.214
The numbers Broussard found
in Noa's gear.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.519

a numbers station.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.031
- 72, 8, 11...

04:58.031 --> 05:00.468
- Old spy trick used
a lot in the Cold War.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.870
The numbers only make sense

05:02.870 --> 05:04.872
to somebody who knows
what they're listening for.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.206
- So we need a code book?

05:06.206 --> 05:08.376
- Noa didn't
leave one behind, did she?

05:08.376 --> 05:09.877
- 4, 30, 72...

05:09.877 --> 05:11.979

05:11.979 --> 05:14.482

05:14.482 --> 05:17.084
I would feel a lot better
about leaving the Colony

05:17.084 --> 05:18.285
if I knew where we were going.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.720

05:37.571 --> 05:39.139
Add that to
the eight this morning.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.974

where those trucks are headed

05:40.974 --> 05:43.444
and what they're doing.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.979

in three unmarked trucks

05:45.979 --> 05:47.848
coming through
the Downtown Gateway.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.683
Let's put follow teams on them.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.151
- Not too close.
I don't want them

05:51.151 --> 05:52.753
to know they're being watched.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
- Let's try to do this on radio.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.758
Maintain standard patrols and
report in with location updates.

for each ward.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.643
Okay, yeah, pass that along.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.151
- It's always a pleasure,
Mr. Snyder.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.388
- Busy day?

07:03.891 --> 07:06.527
- The Governor-General
hasn't brought you up to speed?

07:06.527 --> 07:09.563
- Pretend she hasn't.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.735
- The bloc is being evacuated.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.805
- Evacuated to where?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.239
- San Fernando.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.308
An effort to alleviate
the supply shortages

07:21.308 --> 07:24.745
caused by the elimination of
the labor and processing camps.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.880
- Those camps supplied
the whole LA Colony.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.349
San Fernando has to have
the same supply shortages we do.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.385
- I can't speak
for their situation.

07:35.388 --> 07:39.059
- So that's the official story.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.295
And now, the real reason?

07:44.264 --> 07:47.167
- [mirthless scoff]

07:47.167 --> 07:49.937
A recovery operation
for the gauntlet.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.506
Either we'll find it
through border inspections

07:52.506 --> 07:53.607
during the evacuation

07:53.607 --> 07:55.242
or the Intelligence Directorate

07:55.242 --> 07:56.877
will lead an exhaustive search

07:56.877 --> 07:58.679
once the bloc is emptied.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.782
- That seems tedious.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.953
What happens to the Green Zone?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.021
- The whole Los Angeles bloc

08:08.021 --> 08:11.692
is being cleared out
for the effort.

- Blackjacks.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.488

08:41.488 --> 08:42.856

on Hennessey's place.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.224
- You led them right to us.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.859

11:43.703 --> 11:45.839
- This whole "evacuating
to San Fernando" thing

11:45.839 --> 11:47.540
is a convincing cover story,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.676
so long as you're
too ignorant or terrified

11:49.676 --> 11:53.580
to start pulling at the threads.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.849
Were you going to tell me?

11:57.184 --> 12:00.020
- I got the call last night.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.122
You were in such a good mood,
I didn't want to ruin it.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.323
- By giving me a heads-up

12:03.323 --> 12:06.827
that the world
was coming to an end?

12:06.827 --> 12:11.331
- I have defended this bloc
as long as I can.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.166
But it's become a nightmare.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.734
For us and them.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.603
- Them being the RAPs?

12:16.603 --> 12:19.606
- There's a faction
of hardliners amongst our Hosts

12:19.606 --> 12:23.276
and they've been
demanding action for months.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.314
- There are moderate aliens?

12:27.314 --> 12:28.681
- Yes.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.750
And they were overruled.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.185
And in light of Alcala's regime,

12:32.185 --> 12:34.254
I can't say that
I disagree with them.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.656
- So that's it?

12:36.656 --> 12:40.961
They flip a switch
and turn Los Angeles into glass.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.964
- Well, actually,
they've rethought that approach.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.000
It was causing labor shortages.

12:48.535 --> 12:52.205
- Dare I ask what
they're planning instead?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.245
- Total Rendition.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.415
I did everything that I could--
we--

13:02.415 --> 13:04.117
we did everything
that we could,

13:04.117 --> 13:07.354
but the decision
has come from above, so.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.922
- Far above.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.758
How long do we have?

13:11.758 --> 13:14.194

this all means for me?

13:25.038 --> 13:27.107
*

13:27.107 --> 13:28.876
- I'm being transitioned
into a position

13:28.876 --> 13:30.277
with the Global Authority.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.312
I've carved out a place for you

13:32.312 --> 13:33.713
on my staff.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.549
- Europe?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.818
- I thought it was
a fairly generous offer,

13:38.818 --> 13:41.821
given where you were
just a few weeks ago.

13:41.821 --> 13:48.862
*

13:53.133 --> 13:56.136
- My daughter.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.139
- It's already been
taken care of.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.841
She can't come with us.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.678
But I put her name
on the exemption list myself.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.880
*

14:06.880 --> 14:10.517
- Thank you.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.153
- Don't overthink it, Alan.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.822
Go home and get
your affairs in order.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.225
I'll send a car for you.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.094
*

14:21.094 --> 14:22.229
[patterned knock]

14:28.201 --> 14:29.536
- Katie?

14:29.536 --> 14:32.072
- You can say no.
You probably should.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.341
I didn't know where else to go.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.742
- Hm.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.411
What can I do to help?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.388
- We won't stay long.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.423
Just a few hours to regroup.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.426
[tense music]

14:53.426 --> 14:55.895
- I'll put on some tea.

14:55.895 --> 15:02.970
*

15:02.970 --> 15:05.605
- We need to keep our heads down
and dig another trench.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.107
- We need to leave the bloc.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.708
- I don't see how
that's an option.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.610
- Our kids
can't live underground.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.213
- I didn't say
you should be happy about it.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.647
- We can't.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.184
Kids have been through
too much already.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.019
- I wish there was another way.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.687
There isn't.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.661
[solemn music]

15:28.661 --> 15:30.363
- We could contact Snyder.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.132
- What?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.201
- What are you
gonna offer him, Will?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.203
Me?

15:36.203 --> 15:38.338
*

15:38.338 --> 15:41.241
- The gauntlet.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.409
- No.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.844
My team died for that thing.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.679
*

15:46.679 --> 15:50.317
- We might all die
because of it.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.586
- Doesn't mean
I'm gonna hand it to Snyder.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.524
- You go with us,
you live to fight another day.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.493
You stay here with the gauntlet,

16:00.493 --> 16:02.562
you're dead.

16:02.562 --> 16:07.167
*

16:07.167 --> 16:10.203
[indistinct commotion]

16:19.012 --> 16:22.049
- Remain calm.
Everybody's gonna get something.

16:23.850 --> 16:24.851
- Excuse me.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.754
- Um, there is a line, miss.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.489
- I'm Maddie Kenner.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.158
- We know who you are.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.360
If you wish to begin atonement

16:33.360 --> 16:34.927
and recommit yourself
to the faith,

16:34.927 --> 16:36.996
then you can wait in line
with the others.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.498
- Recommit?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.267
I'm a seventh level member.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.001
I founded this temple.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.536
- The Greatest Day teaches us

16:43.536 --> 16:45.838
that humility is
one of the key pillars

16:45.838 --> 16:48.175
in a life of service
to our Hosts.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.044
Perhaps beginning your journey
anew could set an example

16:51.044 --> 16:55.182
for others who have
found themselves lost.

16:55.182 --> 16:58.185
[solemn music]

16:58.185 --> 17:05.292
*

17:07.427 --> 17:14.101
*

17:14.101 --> 17:16.203
- Sir, a call just came in

17:16.203 --> 17:18.305
from Homeland's
anti-terrorism tip line.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.972
They're asking for you
specifically.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.074
- For me?

17:21.074 --> 17:22.642
- Want me to patch you through?

17:22.642 --> 17:23.910
- Why not?

17:23.910 --> 17:27.414
*

17:27.414 --> 17:30.317
Hello?

17:30.317 --> 17:33.052
- Heard you were back in town.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.454
If you want to catch up,

17:34.454 --> 17:36.156
call me back
from a public phone.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.991
0107.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.893
- Uh...
[line clicks]

17:40.893 --> 17:45.898
*

17:45.898 --> 17:49.102
- I need a public phone.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.770
[phone ringing]

17:57.977 --> 18:00.747
- Heard your people
are all looking for something.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.882
I can get it.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.885
*

18:05.885 --> 18:09.522
- What are you asking
in exchange?

18:09.522 --> 18:13.726
- Relocation outside the Colony.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.328
- [scoffs]

18:15.328 --> 18:17.730
This is all a lot to ask,

18:17.730 --> 18:21.401
even for the spirit
of an old friend.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.070
- I'm giving you my word.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.739
That still counts
for something, doesn't it?

18:26.739 --> 18:30.009
*

18:30.009 --> 18:34.247
- Let's say I get past
my healthy skepticism.

18:41.053 --> 18:41.254
.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.257
[indistinct chatter]

18:54.334 --> 18:56.803
- [over microphone]
Brothers and sisters,

18:56.803 --> 19:01.541
our glorious Hosts have brought
us a great blessing today.

19:01.541 --> 19:05.745
Salvation from the difficult
conditions in our bloc.

19:05.745 --> 19:10.317
We are all being relocated
to the San Fernando bloc...

19:10.317 --> 19:13.019
[crowd commotion]
Where the faith stands strong

19:13.019 --> 19:15.255
and resources are plentiful.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.089
- [over bullhorn]
Busses will transport you

19:17.089 --> 19:19.426
to the evacuation center
immediately.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.662
- Trust,
trust in your faith

19:22.662 --> 19:24.664
to navigate you
through hardship

19:24.664 --> 19:26.165
and you will be rewarded.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.166
[microphone feedback]

19:27.166 --> 19:28.935
[crowd commotion]

19:28.935 --> 19:30.503
- [over speaker]
Please approach the busses.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.705
Form single-file lines.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.106
There will be plenty...

19:34.106 --> 19:35.575
- Hey, come on.
- All right, move it on the bus.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.577
- Get off me.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.012
[indistinct instructions,
chatter]

19:40.012 --> 19:42.615
- Form single-file lines.

19:42.615 --> 19:46.253
[tense music]

19:46.253 --> 19:48.688
[soft chatter]

19:48.688 --> 19:50.257
- Do you understand
what you did?

19:50.257 --> 19:51.591
I don't care what it takes.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.893
I want them found.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.928
- [clears throat]

20:01.868 --> 20:04.103
Commander, thank you for
meeting me on such short notice.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.439
- I don't have a lot of time,
Mr. Snyder.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.576
- None of us do,
from what I understand.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.381
- What do you want?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.616
- Does the Global Authority
still have

20:16.616 --> 20:21.321
any interest in
reclaiming the stolen gauntlet?

20:21.321 --> 20:23.756
I mean, that's what started
this whole hullabaloo

20:23.756 --> 20:25.258
in the first place, isn't it?

20:25.258 --> 20:27.260
I figure it must
still have some value.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.429
- You have access to it?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.664
- I deal in information.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.767
- I deal in absolutes.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.169
*

20:37.169 --> 20:40.407
- If I could somehow
provide information

20:40.407 --> 20:42.675
that led to
the gauntlet's recovery,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.911
what would it be worth
to the Global Authority?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.679
- You're asking that
as a representative

20:46.679 --> 20:49.349
of the Governor-General?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.585
- Today,
I'm representing myself.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.354
*

20:54.354 --> 20:57.924
- If you were to be the one
to lead us to the gauntlet,

20:57.924 --> 21:00.593
I promise you, Mr. Snyder,

21:00.593 --> 21:02.995
you'll never want
for anything again.

21:02.995 --> 21:09.001
*

21:09.001 --> 21:10.837
- * We'll

21:10.837 --> 21:12.839
both: * Meet again

21:12.839 --> 21:15.375
- * Don't know where
- * Don't know when

21:15.375 --> 21:18.077
both: * Don't know when

21:18.077 --> 21:21.180
* But I know we'll meet again

21:21.180 --> 21:24.517
* Some sunny

21:24.517 --> 21:25.685
- * Day
- * Day

21:25.685 --> 21:27.219
- [chuckles softly]

21:27.219 --> 21:29.188
- That's it.
* Ba dum ba dum

21:29.188 --> 21:33.025
both: * We'll meet again

21:33.025 --> 21:34.461
- Excuse us, Detective,

21:34.461 --> 21:36.195
but the bloc's being eliminated.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.897
- Eliminated?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.532
- We have orders to pull
you and your family

21:39.532 --> 21:42.068
out of the Colony and move you
to our mountain facility.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.102
- Give me a minute.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.236
- Need to roll out in five, sir.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.805
We're on a clock.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.277
[door closes]

21:54.481 --> 21:58.084
- How does a vacation
in the mountains sound?

21:58.084 --> 22:00.887
[ominous music]

22:00.887 --> 22:02.489
* And I know we'll

22:02.489 --> 22:03.823
both: * Meet again

22:03.823 --> 22:07.794
* Some sunny

22:07.794 --> 22:13.700
- * Day
- * Day

22:14.701 --> 22:17.704
[dark music]

22:17.704 --> 22:23.876
*

22:23.876 --> 22:25.512
- Jesus Christ!

22:25.512 --> 22:26.746
- It's all right.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.080
It's all right.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.582
- You said
we were doing this alone.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.917
- I said for you to come alone.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.552
He's here to prove I'm serious.

22:32.552 --> 22:36.155
- Okay, I get it.
You're serious.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.525
- The truth.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.092
If we make a trade,
do you have the juice

22:40.092 --> 22:41.428
to get us out of the bloc?

22:41.428 --> 22:43.830
- Is the gauntlet here?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.031
- Course not.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.466
- Good.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.069
I want to come with you.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.240
- Why?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.677
- Because our Hosts have
decided that

22:57.677 --> 23:00.780
Los Angeles is no longer
in their future plans.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.816
Total Rendition is coming.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.085
- What the hell is
"Total Rendition"?

23:06.085 --> 23:09.088
- Our glorious Hosts
come into the bloc,

23:09.088 --> 23:10.790
round up every human
they can find,

23:10.790 --> 23:12.158
and take them to the Factory.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.193
Just like that.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.697
- Why?

23:17.697 --> 23:18.931
Why are they doing this?

23:18.931 --> 23:21.868
- To put it bluntly...

23:21.868 --> 23:24.003
because of him.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.178
- And they didn't
give you an out?

23:32.178 --> 23:34.814
- Oh, they did.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.883
The Governor-General,

23:36.883 --> 23:39.385
bless her heart,
promised to

23:39.385 --> 23:41.488
transition me into
an administrative position

23:41.488 --> 23:42.855
at the Global Authority.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.524
- Well,
that sounds a whole lot better

23:44.524 --> 23:46.559
than what we're facing.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.397
- I know you
might not believe it,

23:51.397 --> 23:53.466
but I do have a conscience.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.835
[solemn music]

23:55.835 --> 23:58.304
After spending the day
watching the rats

23:58.304 --> 24:00.507
all flee the sinking ship,

24:00.507 --> 24:03.976
I decided...

24:03.976 --> 24:07.614
I just don't want to be a rat

24:07.614 --> 24:10.116
anymore.

24:20.960 --> 24:21.160
.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.496
- Snyder wants to come with us.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.099
- What do you make of all this?

24:27.099 --> 24:28.535
- I don't like it.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.703
- We could maybe keep running,
but not the kids.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.205
- I'd rather be on the run and
stay alive than turn myself in.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.473
- We're not
turning ourselves in.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.142
- Men like Snyder
always have an angle.

24:36.142 --> 24:40.379
- Maybe his angle is he just
wants to live through this.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.615
- He needs us,
that's why we can trust him.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.618
[telephone rings]

24:45.618 --> 24:47.153
I'm not saying
this isn't a huge risk

24:47.153 --> 24:49.956
or that it isn't
as dangerous as hell--it is.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.457
But if we don't do something,

24:51.457 --> 24:54.561
we're just waiting around
to get caught.

24:54.561 --> 24:58.565
- Sorry to interrupt,
but it's the Occupation.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.366
It's an automated call.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.670
They said the bloc's
being evacuated.

25:05.605 --> 25:10.076
- There are evacuation centers
in every...ward.

25:10.076 --> 25:13.946
They're asking people
to report immediately.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.415
- Snyder was telling the truth.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.322
- Hey, guys, so,

25:23.322 --> 25:26.292
Dad and I have to go
