00:20.270 --> 00:23.940
In my town, we had a game
called the "Squid Game."

00:25.900 --> 00:29.237
We called it that because it's played
in a court shaped like a squid.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.614
The rules are simple.

00:32.991 --> 00:37.620
Children are divided into two groups,
the offense and the defense.

00:39.956 --> 00:44.002
Once the game starts, the defense
can run around on two feet within bounds,

00:44.085 --> 00:48.048
while the offense outside the lines
are only allowed to hop on one foot.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.510
It's your mom.

00:52.594 --> 00:58.516
But if an attacker cuts through
the waist of the squid passing defense,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.436
then they are given freedom
to use both feet.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.319
Inspector royal.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.780
Inspector royal.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.699
For whatever reason,
we called that the inspector royal.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.370
When we were ready for the final battle,

01:20.038 --> 01:23.291
all the attackers gathered
at the entrance to the squid.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.545
Go.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.090
In order to win,

01:30.173 --> 01:33.218
the attackers must tap
the small closed-off space

01:33.301 --> 01:35.220
on the squid's head with their foot.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.474
But if someone on the defense
manages to push you

01:39.557 --> 01:41.476
outside of the squid's boundaries,

01:42.560 --> 01:43.645
you die.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.649
That's right. You die.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.334
Victory!

02:06.417 --> 02:07.585
Victory.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.965
Once you tap the squid's head,
you win and yell out, "Victory."

02:12.966 --> 02:16.886
At that moment,
I felt as if I owned the entire world,

02:17.387 --> 02:18.304
exhilarated.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.535
EPISODE 1
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

02:42.871 --> 02:43.830
Ah.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.583
Um…

02:47.333 --> 02:49.043
Is this my daily allowance or what?

02:50.336 --> 02:54.465
No. Remember,
Ga-yeong's birthday is today?

02:57.510 --> 02:58.678
Yeah. Of course, I do.

02:58.761 --> 03:03.808
And don't forget, go and get her,
uh, something for dinner later.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.061
Well, I can't buy her a nice meal
with these much. Times are tough.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.648
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.234
Go buy her some fried chicken.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.111
Just chicken, Mom?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.530
Don't you think I should get
a present for her?

03:17.614 --> 03:18.823
Give me some more, huh?

03:19.824 --> 03:21.117
I'm broke.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.952
What are you talking about?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.663
I gave you everything I made chauffeuring.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.665
Oh, please, that petty change?

03:28.249 --> 03:31.836
Hey, we can't even pay your loan's
monthly interest off with that.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.173
We can't do that now,
and we barely spend anything.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.091
Let's use some when we have to.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.385
Goodness.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.596
Oh.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.811
And will you stop working so much?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.564
Make sure you soak
the dishes after you're done.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.653
You don't even make that much,
plus you're pulling your back out!

04:09.207 --> 04:10.124
Ah!

04:22.387 --> 04:25.348
DAEHAN BANK

04:25.431 --> 04:26.349
ENTER YOUR PIN

04:28.935 --> 04:29.769
Huh?

04:29.852 --> 04:30.895
Hey.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.146
It should be my birthday.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.607
-No way.
-Pin number changed on you, huh?

04:35.191 --> 04:37.110
I guess your mother finally abandoned you.

04:38.736 --> 04:39.696
Hold on.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.824
Huh?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.618
Oh, shit.
What did that woman change it to, huh?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.203
Try her birthday or, or something.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.705
Her birthday?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.456
Her birthday.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.374
Um, uh…

04:51.457 --> 04:53.751
You're telling me you don't know
your own mother's birthday?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.003
-Any kid knows that.
-Hey!

04:55.086 --> 04:57.130
-Don't say that. I do know.
-Hey.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.925
She celebrates it going by the lunar date,
meaning it's not the same every year.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.678
-Use your brain for once.
-Then put in the lunar date.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.431
Come on. Work!

05:08.266 --> 05:09.517
Oh, goddamn it!

05:11.269 --> 05:12.353
Oh, shit.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.647
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.649
They'll block your card
if you get it wrong again.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.735
You really gotta think about this one.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.831
Please select
the amount you would like to withdraw.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.334
Oh!

05:34.417 --> 05:36.210
What was it? Your birthday?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.754
My kid's. It's today.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.881
Ah! The old woman cares
about her granddaughter

05:39.964 --> 05:41.466
more than her own son.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.509
Ah, shit.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.428
-Number nine…
-Go, go, go.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.138
-Come on!
-Come on!

05:51.309 --> 05:52.894
-Come on!
-Go, go!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.563
Go! Yeah, come on. Go! Go!

05:55.646 --> 05:57.899
Go, go!

05:57.982 --> 05:59.525
Let's go.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.319
Let's go!

06:01.402 --> 06:04.280
Go! Go! Faster!

06:07.241 --> 06:08.785
Dang!

06:09.285 --> 06:12.246
You told me that I was gonna win this.
Goddamn it!

06:13.539 --> 06:15.166
Stupid little jerk.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.836
How could you lose
with an animal like that?

06:26.511 --> 06:29.847
Attention. Betting
for the tenth race is about to end.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.599
Please place your final bet.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.018
-I repeat. Betting for the tenth race…
-Hey, man, hurry up, will you, please?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.813
…is about to end.
Please place your final bet.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.564
Hey, buddy.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.193
-Hey, what are you-- Ooh!
-Please don't touch me!

06:42.276 --> 06:45.196
How about you leave me alone?
Can't you see I'm trying to think?

06:55.706 --> 06:56.707
Okay.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.922
No. 9 Baekil Legend
is placed right in the middle.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.757
That's it.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.217
Come on.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.510
Go, come on.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.679
Go. Okay. Yeah.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.182
That's it. Come on, come on!

07:13.266 --> 07:16.060
Come on! Faster! Faster! Come on.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.648
Yeah. Oh!

07:20.731 --> 07:22.525
No. 6, Thunderflash,
continues to run forward.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.277
-Go! Go!
-Thunderflash outruns No. 7…

07:24.360 --> 07:25.778
Go six and eight!

07:25.862 --> 07:27.363
That's it! That's it! That's it!

07:29.449 --> 07:32.076
That's it! Go, six and eight!

07:33.870 --> 07:36.456
Second place from…

07:36.539 --> 07:39.250
I did it, man. Six and eight!

07:41.711 --> 07:43.629
-Why did you choose six, anyway?
-Oh!

07:43.713 --> 07:44.839
Damn! What did I say?

07:44.922 --> 07:48.593
Today's June 8th. Six and eight!
The day my daughter was born!

07:52.680 --> 07:54.974
-Four and a half million won.
-Oh, thanks so much.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.687
Here. A little something for you.
Thanks again.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.439
-What do I get?
-Come on!

08:02.023 --> 08:04.150
Hey, wait up for me, asshole!

08:04.233 --> 08:06.569
OFF TRACK BETTING

08:09.447 --> 08:12.992
I hope you're excited. Uh-huh!
I'll pick you up after school, okay?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.498
Fried chicken?

08:18.581 --> 08:21.292
Hey, you can get something
really expensive tonight, huh!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.544
Don't worry about the price at all,
okay? Hmm?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.505
Mm, mm, mm…

08:26.047 --> 08:28.674
Think about what you wanna eat
and make me a list during recess.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.051
Okay, honey?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.678
I'll see you at seven then.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.391
Look forward to it.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.893
You're not gonna believe what…

08:40.228 --> 08:42.146
Hey! Hey, Gi-hun!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.105
Hey!

08:44.065 --> 08:45.525
Long time no see, huh!

08:46.317 --> 08:49.028
Hey, Ga-yeong, hold on, right.
I love you too. Okay, bye.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.821
-Huh?
-Hey, hey, hey.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.281
-He's running!
-Get him!

08:54.367 --> 08:56.494
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.037
Oh.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.622
Oh!

09:00.581 --> 09:02.375
Oh.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.709
I'm sorry.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.796
Hey, kid, you okay? Oh. Shit!

09:08.714 --> 09:11.050
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, get him!

09:11.133 --> 09:13.636
Get him!
Over there! Over there!

09:16.013 --> 09:18.266
Wait a minute. Let me stand up.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.769
Okay. Just… Look, I got cash for real.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.271
Oh, yeah?

09:23.354 --> 09:25.064
Uh-huh.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.316
-Then why did you run, huh?
-Because I…

09:28.109 --> 09:32.280
I, I've been saving up so I…
I could pay you all the ones that I took.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.826
Goodness, what a trooper. Look at you.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.286
So then, how much you got?

09:38.369 --> 09:39.662
Four million.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.583
Take this amount now.
I'll pay the rest next month, so…

09:44.875 --> 09:45.793
What…

09:49.589 --> 09:51.007
Oh!

09:51.090 --> 09:52.341
Hey, kid, you okay?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.219
Oh.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.721
Let me see. Oop, oop, oop, opp, oop,

09:56.804 --> 09:58.639
Come on, let me see.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.474
Poor thing.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.771
Ahh…

10:06.314 --> 10:08.232
Got a sweet taste of it.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.068
I guess you're still eating well.
Spending the money you know is mine.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.695
I swear I had it…

10:12.778 --> 10:14.155
I had it, I had your money.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.199
Look, I bet on six and eight and they won,
so I had the cash right here.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.117
Hey.

10:24.915 --> 10:28.127
Do you know why
nosebleeds are so easy to get, huh?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.964
Because there are so many capillaries.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.008
Oh, no. Hey, don't do this.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.093
-I don't wanna die.
-Your blood was tasty.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.639
I think my boys and I
should make a nice delicious soup in it.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.849
I'll pay you!

10:41.932 --> 10:45.394
I'll pay you. I mean it. I'll pay you.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.480
Jesus, guy.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.940
Don't make me feel sorry for you
with all that crying.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.151
How did you know I was such a softie?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.031
Hey.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
Okay, wipe off your tears.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.328
Sign here and your fingerprint.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.291
If you don't pay it off by next month,
I'll take one of your kidneys.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.836
And then after that,
I'll take one of your eyes. Okay?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.632
-You don't like it?
-No, uh, I got it. Yeah.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.551
Next month is good with me.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.345
-Here.
-Okay.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.055
Well, I, I need ink.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.228
There, you got your ink.
It's all natural too.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.480
Huh?

11:29.563 --> 11:30.523
Oh.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
That's it. Right there.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.861
DISCLAIMER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

11:35.945 --> 11:39.573
You did it, huh!

11:39.657 --> 11:42.368
You have one month. Take care of yourself.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.870
Uh, hold on. Sir, excuse me.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.209
I'm sorry to even ask but…

11:50.835 --> 11:52.753
may I please borrow 10,000 won?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.090
You little…

11:56.882 --> 11:59.677
Forget it.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.095
WINDOW CLOSED

12:03.347 --> 12:04.473
Excuse me.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.351
Sorry to do this.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.146
Uh…

12:10.229 --> 12:11.689
Can I get back that 10,000?

12:14.483 --> 12:15.818
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

12:25.202 --> 12:26.162
Come on.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.209
Ah!

12:39.216 --> 12:41.844
Yeah. Come on. That's it, that's it.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.679
That's right. Ah!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.226
Goddamn it!

12:50.269 --> 12:51.729
Excuse me, sir.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.732
You need to stop and pick the prize
you want first.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.817
Does that help you?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.706
Ah. Ah…

13:11.665 --> 13:13.000
That's it. Good.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.002
Yes, that's it.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.879
-Oh!
-Yay!

13:19.173 --> 13:21.342
Yay!

13:23.552 --> 13:25.971
Great job! Thank you. Thank you!

13:26.055 --> 13:28.557
Yay!

13:36.232 --> 13:37.358
Oh, this?

13:38.567 --> 13:41.487
It's a huge mosquito bite, that's all.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.324
Mosquitoes are really mean
these days. Yeah.

13:47.159 --> 13:51.330
Dad, you can be
in all of the fights that you want,

13:52.039 --> 13:53.499
but don't get hurt too bad.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.130
I'm sorry, sweetie. I really am.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.468
You know, I wanted to buy you
a nicer dinner than this.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.469
It's okay.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.515
We went with my stepdad
to a steakhouse earlier, so…

14:12.476 --> 14:13.853
A steak, huh?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.523
That's nice of him.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.695
Well, I still want tteokbokki
a lot more, though.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.825
I'm not allowed to have it at home.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.410
Mom says it's junk food.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.746
Eat up then.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.249
Oh, my gosh.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.584
Surprise.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.837
Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.301
Ah…

14:49.805 --> 14:50.806
Uh…

14:53.309 --> 14:56.145
You know why, huh?
These days, even women go to war.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.271
Uh-huh.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.814
I mean, when you finally get older,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.859
there's not gonna be that kind
of discrimination like we got now.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.236
And you'll need to get used to this
pretty soon, you know.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.825
Ah.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.871
Oh, plus, it's a lighter.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.041
Looks like the real deal, doesn't it?

15:18.292 --> 15:21.420
I think you'll get in trouble
with Mom again

15:22.004 --> 15:23.881
if she saw me holding this.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.257
Is that right?

15:26.050 --> 15:29.094
I'll keep it then, just till you get
a little bit older. Okay?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.888
Hey, don't smoke of it, though.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.306
Oh, come on, I'm clean now.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.940
All right. All right.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.068
I'll make sure I'll stop smoking for real.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.738
And you'll see next year, huh,
I'll get an awesome present for you, okay?

15:48.739 --> 15:49.907
Ga-yeong, I swear.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.242
Next year?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.869
Last year, you had a birthday.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.496
This one came right around, right?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.956
And the next one will be quick.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.500
Um, Dad?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.835
Hmm? Shoot.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.924
Nothing.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.304
Okay. Come on, come on.
Have more tteokbokki.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.641
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.559
And mix it with some of that in.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.119
Why did you bring her back so late?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.537
She's not dressed for the cold.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.123
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.959
We're ten minutes late at most. Okay?

16:42.042 --> 16:43.794
I said I'd drive down
to get her, didn't I?

16:43.877 --> 16:46.088
It's her birthday. Let's not yell.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.132
Mom.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.342
-Oh.
-Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.137
I'll carry her to the elevator
if you don't mind, okay?

16:53.220 --> 16:54.513
She can walk on her own.

16:54.596 --> 16:55.597
Mom…

16:55.681 --> 16:58.225
-Ga-yeong, get down.
-Ah, jeez. Seriously.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.686
All right. Let's go.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.153
Bye, Dad.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.779
Go on in. Good night.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.876
Ah, wait a minute!
Hey, open the door!

17:23.959 --> 17:25.335
Ah, shit!

17:55.240 --> 17:56.241
Hello, sir.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.368
Can I talk to you?

18:01.538 --> 18:03.165
I don't believe in Jesus.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.626
It's not that.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.213
Listen, I wanna let you in
on a great opportunity to…

18:16.220 --> 18:19.890
I come from a very long line of Buddhists,
so find another guy to preach to,

18:22.601 --> 18:23.560
Mister.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.730
Would you like to play a game with me?

18:29.149 --> 18:30.275
Who are you?

18:31.777 --> 18:32.903
Salesman, huh?

18:34.071 --> 18:36.156
You people have all kinds of tactics.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.078
And I know you're only doing your job,
but I really don't have time to sit here…

18:45.874 --> 18:48.627
I'm sure you've
played ddakji before, right?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.131
Play a few round of ddakji with me.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.967
And each time you win,
I'll pay you a 100,000 won.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.977
Wait, so if I hit your ddakji,
and it flips over,

19:06.145 --> 19:07.688
I get a 100,000 won?

19:07.771 --> 19:11.358
And if I can flip yours, you will give me
the exact same amount of money.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.574
You can also be the first to play.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.456
Hey, look, I had a bad day today.

19:27.624 --> 19:31.461
You pull a scam or you rip me off,
well, then, I'll… I'll kill you, huh?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.882
So then it's my turn, eh?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.386
So which color do you wanna play as?

19:47.477 --> 19:48.687
Shh…

20:11.919 --> 20:13.378
Well, what's wrong?

20:13.962 --> 20:15.589
So the thing is…

20:17.382 --> 20:19.176
How about you use your body to pay?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.136
A what?

20:23.013 --> 20:24.139
What the hell, man?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.391
I'll take a 100 grand off per slap.

20:31.772 --> 20:32.814
One more round.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.070
One more round.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.478
Oh! Ah!

21:43.593 --> 21:45.971
Did you see that? I beat you, man!

21:46.054 --> 21:48.974
Did you see that? I did it. I won.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.060
Get over here. It's my turn to do this.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.105
What are you doing, jerk?

21:56.690 --> 21:57.566
Your 100 grand.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.821
You're welcome, sir.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.494
Oh, yeah.

22:10.954 --> 22:11.913
The money.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.257
You know, sir.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.010
There are other games like this
where you can make even more.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.638
Come on, it must sound tempting.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.349
Hey, dude.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.726
Is this some new pyramid scheme or what?

22:34.394 --> 22:35.896
Look, I'm desperate, okay?

22:35.979 --> 22:38.065
Still, not that desperate yet.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.238
Mr. Gi-hun.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.951
Earlier, you signed away
your physical rights.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.956
Your name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.750
You attended Daehan Technical High School.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.294
Worked at Dragon Motors,
Assembly Team One.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.879
The company laid you off ten years ago.

23:00.962 --> 23:02.964
Opened a chicken shop,
and then a small snack bar.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.467
Both of them failed,
you're working as a chauffeur right now.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.386
You've been divorced
for about three years,

23:07.469 --> 23:09.221
and your daughter is ten years old.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.474
A hundred and sixty million won owed
just to loan sharks,

23:12.557 --> 23:15.227
and you owe 250 more to the bank.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.273
Who are you?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.985
What business of yours is all that?

23:29.032 --> 23:31.118
We don't have many spots left.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.081
Just think about it.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.030
All right, then.

24:12.951 --> 24:16.496
You drink at all tonight?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.415
No.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.751
I haven't had a drop,
but I feel tipsy still, anyway.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.715
Because look what I got.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.260
Gi-hun, what did you do now?
You gambled again?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.345
Don't you look at me like that. I didn't.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.848
I earned it all this time. It's all legit.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.558
What's with your face,
by the way?

24:36.641 --> 24:38.685
-What'd they try to beat you up for now?
-Hey.

24:38.768 --> 24:39.603
Forget it.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.605
Sang-woo been around here?

24:41.688 --> 24:43.106
How's he doing at work?

24:43.190 --> 24:44.608
Always keeping busy.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.194
Right now, he's on a business trip abroad.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.571
Ah, ungrateful prick.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.282
Tell him to give me a call
when he gets back in town.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.909
After all I did?

24:53.992 --> 24:56.369
He got into Seoul National University,
thanks to me.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.747
I used to take him to school
when we were young.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.375
That's why he went to school,
got a good job.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.211
He at least ought to buy me a drink.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.506
What are you talking about now?
Here, take this home, okay?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.174
Not to a bar. Go straight home.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.593
Here. Keep the change.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.561
Prick! That was 12,000 won.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.826
Hmm.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.457
Are you hungry? Huh?

25:43.708 --> 25:44.709
Here.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.629
Come on.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.965
You have to finish it, okay?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.759
I got that with the money I made
getting slapped, so enjoy it.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.598
Ooh.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.322
Here. Some allowance.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.450
Come on. Take it.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.743
Hold on.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.705
Were you out gambling again?

26:22.622 --> 26:23.873
Of course not.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.669
Wait a minute.
What did you do to your face?

26:29.129 --> 26:30.547
Answer me right now!

26:30.630 --> 26:32.340
It was nothing like that!

26:33.425 --> 26:37.220
Hold on. Are you saying
this money is stolen?

26:38.054 --> 26:40.432
I didn't steal anything, Mom.
I earned it all.

26:41.016 --> 26:45.937
I worked, okay. All day, I worked my hands
and face off to earn this money for us.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.106
Oh, gosh.

26:54.529 --> 26:59.034
So did you get fried chicken for Ga-yeong?

27:00.327 --> 27:01.995
Yes, I got her dinner…

27:02.746 --> 27:05.332
and my present and everything.
It was nice.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.209
And did anything come up tonight?

27:09.878 --> 27:10.962
Like what?

27:13.006 --> 27:17.969
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad
are all going somewhere.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.014
They're moving to the US next year.

27:22.724 --> 27:26.186
And you'll see next year, huh. I'll get
an awesome present for you. Okay?

27:27.312 --> 27:28.438
Ga-yeong, I swear.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.107
Next year?

27:32.525 --> 27:33.485
The US?

27:34.152 --> 27:35.070
That's right.

27:35.153 --> 27:39.074
Her stepdad's job begins soon
and needs him to go.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.078
So the entire family
is going to move there.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.500
I see.

27:49.626 --> 27:53.546
You hear me?
How can you eat anything right now, huh?

27:54.130 --> 27:56.132
You need to get your daughter
to stay here.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.136
And how do I do that?

28:02.305 --> 28:05.225
We're done. We settled that
when we agreed to the divorce.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.941
I talked to that young man upstairs
who knows the law,

28:13.024 --> 28:17.362
and he said that
the father has to show the child

28:17.445 --> 28:20.949
will have financial support,
and when you can prove that…

28:21.700 --> 28:24.327
then you can take custody. Huh?

28:26.955 --> 28:29.624
If she moves to the US,
you know what will happen?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.376
She'll forget how to speak Korean.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.295
She won't be able to talk to you
like she can right now.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.257
You're going to become a stranger to her.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.553
Are you sure that you…

28:43.763 --> 28:46.516
can really keep going
without seeing your little girl?

29:16.421 --> 29:17.714
Ah, shh…

29:38.985 --> 29:40.403
Hello. Who's calling?

29:41.321 --> 29:42.322
Hello.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.492
You gave me your business card earlier.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.744
Do you wish to participate in the game?

29:47.827 --> 29:51.956
If you wish to participate,
please state your name and birthdate.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.446
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

30:25.448 --> 30:26.699
Uh, yeah.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.951
Password?

30:30.537 --> 30:34.624
Red light, green light.
That's the password.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.301
Ah…

30:49.013 --> 30:52.350
I guess everyone is…

30:52.892 --> 30:55.019
pretty tired. Um…

30:55.645 --> 30:57.939
How long will it take to get to the…

30:58.022 --> 31:00.650
game venue or whatever?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.635
Mm…

31:30.847 --> 31:31.973
What?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.002
-Fifty… Fifty-two…
-What the…

32:44.754 --> 32:47.882
-Fifty-five, fifty-six.
-Excuse me, sir.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.426
-And then, there are those--
-What are you doing?

32:50.510 --> 32:52.971
Stop talking to me or I lose count.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.600
And so I was at 50, so the…

32:58.226 --> 33:01.062
Ah, you must be trying to count
how many of us there are, is that right?

33:01.145 --> 33:03.982
That's right. So could you stop
talking to me for a while?

33:04.649 --> 33:06.776
And then… Huh?

33:07.694 --> 33:08.695
Hold on.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.905
Where was I just then?

33:12.407 --> 33:15.827
Up on the board, sir. There are 456 here.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.622
Oh. Look, that means
you were given the number one.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.332
And I'm… Oh.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.668
I'm the last.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.547
I know all that too.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.258
I'm just counting the numbers.

33:30.341 --> 33:35.680
My doctor said counting is good
so I don't get dementia or anything.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.516
If dementia's a concern for you,
then what are you doing here?

33:38.599 --> 33:39.892
I think you'd wanna stay at home,

33:39.976 --> 33:41.853
let your daughter-in-law
cook your meals for you.

33:41.936 --> 33:43.438
Go sit on a coffee chair somewhere.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.940
-And look at your grandkids, I think.
-You think so?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.734
What about both of your parents?

33:47.817 --> 33:51.404
Do they get nice food cooked
by their daughter-in-law all day long?

33:55.575 --> 33:58.578
I don't have much time left now.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.079
Huh?

34:00.955 --> 34:02.749
The doctor said there's a…

34:03.499 --> 34:06.419
a lump inside over here.
Growing every day.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.005
Your… your head?

34:09.088 --> 34:10.214
Brain tumor.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.136
You little shit!

34:15.219 --> 34:16.387
Stop them!

34:19.223 --> 34:20.099
Hey!

34:20.600 --> 34:21.559
Wow.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.062
It really is a small world, huh!

34:24.145 --> 34:27.356
Look at those eyes.
You still have that temper, huh.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.067
Then again…

34:29.859 --> 34:32.904
nobody broke your spirit,
you could always take a hit.

34:33.529 --> 34:34.572
I took care of you,

34:34.655 --> 34:37.617
I fed you, I taught you
when you had nowhere else.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.410
This is what I get?

34:39.494 --> 34:42.205
You took more from me
than whatever I might possibly owe.

34:42.288 --> 34:45.458
If all of that's true,
how come you ran then?

34:45.541 --> 34:48.628
Well, I didn't. I went independent.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.172
Hmm.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.132
"Independent"?

35:12.318 --> 35:14.779
Independent, huh?
Are you some kind of activist?

35:14.862 --> 35:16.322
Come on then, go wave a flag.

35:16.906 --> 35:17.949
Oh, that's right.

35:18.032 --> 35:21.786
You're from North Korea, huh?
Then wave theirs. Hmm?

35:21.869 --> 35:23.454
Damn you!

35:24.080 --> 35:26.374
Hey, you come here. Hold still.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.126
Oh. That scar on your neck.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.710
You're the damn pickpocket! You loser.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.171
My money, give it back. Where is it?

35:32.255 --> 35:35.007
You took it. I need it-- Ah!

35:35.591 --> 35:37.009
What the hell?

35:38.010 --> 35:38.970
Who are you?

35:40.054 --> 35:42.765
-Uh…
-What do you think you're doing?

35:42.849 --> 35:44.642
Me? Uh, well… Look.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.020
The name's Seong Gi-hun.
I live in Ssangmun-dong.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.147
Hey, Ssangmun-dong shit.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.314
Yeah?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.567
This little bitch and I
weren't done talking.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.154
Yeah, I understand that. It's just
there's something that me and this…

35:56.237 --> 35:57.572
woman should talk about urgently.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.198
You bastard!

35:59.282 --> 36:00.658
What scheme are you two running?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.035
You're asking me?

36:03.119 --> 36:05.163
What's your problem with this girl, 101?

36:05.246 --> 36:07.957
Yeah, I'll bet that,
that you're a thug who preys on girls

36:08.040 --> 36:09.292
that takes advantage of them.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.502
Did you tell her to rob me like that?

36:11.586 --> 36:12.920
-You little son of a bitch!
-Get away! Hey!

36:13.004 --> 36:14.463
Hey, he wants to hit me.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.299
This thug is trying to hit me, huh!

36:16.382 --> 36:18.384
Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

36:18.467 --> 36:20.136
Oh! Oh, there they are!

36:20.219 --> 36:22.263
Over here.
She'll pick all our pockets, sir.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.473
Him too. They'll pick, they'll pick…

36:49.123 --> 36:52.668
I would like to extend
a heartfelt welcome to you all.

36:53.252 --> 36:57.632
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

36:57.715 --> 37:02.595
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.056
And why should we believe that?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.184
Y-You took all our stuff
and put us to sleep coming here,

37:08.267 --> 37:10.186
and then you brought us
to this strange warehouse.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.522
Now you're saying you'll pay us
if we go and play a few games?

37:13.606 --> 37:15.441
You really expect us to buy that?

37:15.524 --> 37:17.735
We reluctantly took all of those measures

37:17.818 --> 37:20.905
to maintain confidentiality
as we brought you here.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.283
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

37:25.159 --> 37:28.371
You all… you all have masks.
Why are you wearing those things?

37:28.454 --> 37:30.414
We do not disclose the faces

37:30.498 --> 37:33.542
and personal information of our staff
to any of the participants.

37:33.626 --> 37:37.755
It's a measure we take
to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.131
Please understand.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.133
Well, I don't believe you one bit.
You got that?

37:41.217 --> 37:43.970
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.347
You can make as many excuses as you want

37:46.430 --> 37:48.724
to make sure nobody knows
you broke the law in here.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.645
If you're going to make up for that,
then we're gonna need something more.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.981
Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.192
Age, 46 years.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.945
Former team leader
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.780
Siphoned money off
from his clients' balances,

38:02.863 --> 38:06.367
then invested it in derivatives
and futures options and failed.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.869
Current loss, 650 million won.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.289
107, Kim Mi-ok, 540 million in debt.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.457
118, Oh Yeong-uk, 1.02 billion in debt.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.294
322, Jung Min-tae, 880 million in debt.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.796
119, No Sang-hun, 1.39 billion in debt.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.716
369, Park Ju-un, 900 million in debt.

38:22.550 --> 38:27.346
Every person standing here in this room
is living on the brink of financial ruin.

38:27.430 --> 38:30.057
You all have debts that you can't pay off.

38:30.766 --> 38:35.062
When we first went to see each of you,
not a single one of you trusted us.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.149
But as you all know, we played a game,

38:38.232 --> 38:40.860
and as we promised,
gave you money when you won.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.321
And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

38:43.404 --> 38:48.242
You called and volunteered to participate
in this game of your own free will.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.160
So this is it.

38:49.243 --> 38:52.121
I'll give you one last chance to choose.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.793
Will you go back to living your old
and depressing lives

38:57.877 --> 38:59.754
getting chased by your creditors?

38:59.837 --> 39:04.216
Or will you act and seize
this last opportunity we're offering here?

39:08.429 --> 39:11.015
Hey! Which games are we playing here?

39:11.098 --> 39:12.600
In order to play fair,

39:12.683 --> 39:15.603
we cannot disclose any information
about the games ahead of time.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.271
One question.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.524
If we win, just how much do we get?

39:29.533 --> 39:33.537
Your prize money will be
accumulated in there after every game.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.795
We will disclose the amount to everyone
after the first game is over.

39:41.545 --> 39:46.217
If you do not wish to participate,
then please let us know at this time.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.916
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

40:18.999 --> 40:21.252
CLAUSE 1: A PLAYER IS NOT ALLOWED
TO STOP PLAYING

40:21.335 --> 40:23.879
CLAUSE 2: A PLAYER WHO REFUSES TO PLAY
WILL BE ELIMINATED

40:23.963 --> 40:26.465
CLAUSE 3: GAMES MAY BE TERMINATED
IF THE MAJORITY AGREES

40:26.549 --> 40:29.009
So then, is that it or…

40:46.986 --> 40:51.532
SIGNATURE, SEONG GI-HUN

40:54.285 --> 40:57.538
Attention, all players.
The first game is about to begin.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.583
Please follow the staff's instructions.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.169
Please make your way
towards the game hall.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.717
Dude, look.

41:10.926 --> 41:13.012
Wow, this place is gigantic.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.391
Please look into the camera. Smile.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.316
Please look into the camera.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.276
Smile.

41:28.819 --> 41:29.778
Ah, shit.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.198
-Hey, move it.
-Ah, shh!

41:37.620 --> 41:39.288
Please look into the camera.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.541
Smile.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.741
Identity verified.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.508
Hey, Sang-woo!

43:16.802 --> 43:18.095
Oh, Sang-woo, my man!

43:19.513 --> 43:21.682
What happened?
What the hell are you doing here?

43:22.474 --> 43:24.518
Uh, your mother and I
were talking the other day.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.812
She told you were out of the country
on a business trip.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.898
What was that guy talking about, huh?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.734
You can't be in debt?

43:32.276 --> 43:34.320
The same Sang-woo who attends SNU, right?

43:34.403 --> 43:35.529
Attention, all players.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.740
-After you enter the game hall…
-We'll talk about it later.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.075
…please stand behind the white line
drawn on the field

43:40.159 --> 43:42.161
and await further instructions.

43:42.703 --> 43:47.124
Once again, will all players
please stand behind the white line

43:47.207 --> 43:49.126
and await further instructions.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.270
This is the Front Man speaking.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.814
Preparations for the first game
are complete.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.858
We can begin now.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.351
-Hey.
-Huh?

44:47.434 --> 44:49.269
What's that? Over there.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.188
Looks really freaky.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.357
Damn, that thing
has a freaking huge head.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.901
Here is the first game.

44:55.984 --> 44:58.487
You will be playing
Red Light, Green Light.

45:01.657 --> 45:05.411
You are allowed to move forward
when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"

45:05.494 --> 45:07.663
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

45:07.746 --> 45:11.792
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.836
Red Light, Green Light?

45:15.462 --> 45:17.381
The thing we did as kids
in the playground?

45:17.464 --> 45:20.300
-Let me repeat the rule.
-I think that's what she said.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.468
Red Light, Green Light?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.220
-Is this a joke?
-You're allowed to move…

45:23.303 --> 45:24.680
-Do you think they're serious?
-…when "it" shouts out, "Green Light."

45:24.763 --> 45:27.141
-Well then, bet on the first one there?
-Stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

45:27.224 --> 45:29.309
If your movement is detected afterward,

45:29.393 --> 45:30.936
-you will be eliminated.
-A million won.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.146
Deal?

45:32.688 --> 45:34.732
Goddamn it.

45:34.815 --> 45:35.649
You're on!

45:36.233 --> 45:38.235
Those players
who cross the finish line

45:38.318 --> 45:40.988
without being eliminated
within the five-minute playtime

45:41.071 --> 45:42.364
will pass this round.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.700
With that, let the game begin.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.370
Green Light.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.208
Red Light.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.419
Whoa.

45:55.502 --> 45:58.297
Player 324. Eliminated.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.966
Dumbass got caught.

46:05.804 --> 46:06.847
That bang.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.349
Did you hear that?

46:16.982 --> 46:18.609
Green Light.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.613
Red Light.

46:25.073 --> 46:27.785
Hey, you got eliminated, idiot.

46:28.494 --> 46:29.620
You can stop with the act.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.368
I will now repeat the rules.

47:52.578 --> 47:55.873
You are allowed to move forward
when "it" shouts out, "Green Light"

47:55.956 --> 47:57.833
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

47:57.916 --> 48:03.380
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.928
I will repeat the rules again.

48:11.221 --> 48:14.057
You can move forward
when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"

48:14.141 --> 48:15.601
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

48:16.685 --> 48:20.981
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.943
With that, let the game resume.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.361
Green Light.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.574
Red Light.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.291
Green Light.

48:42.252 --> 48:43.629
Red Light.

48:46.548 --> 48:47.758
Green Light.

48:50.427 --> 48:51.553
Red Light.

48:55.682 --> 48:56.934
Green Light.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.478
Red Light.

49:03.565 --> 49:06.026
Gi-hun, don't look back. Just listen.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.946
You can't stay there much longer.

49:09.821 --> 49:11.573
I think that doll senses
when you move around.

49:12.658 --> 49:15.285
You won't get caught
if you're behind somebody else.

49:17.245 --> 49:18.205
Green Light.

49:19.414 --> 49:20.540
Red Light.

49:29.341 --> 49:30.592
That timer.

49:36.223 --> 49:37.724
Green Light.

49:38.850 --> 49:39.768
Red Light.

49:49.444 --> 49:50.737
Green Light.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.115
Red Light.

50:01.289 --> 50:02.833
Green Light.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.167
Red Light.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.171
Who is that? I hear you.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.757
The bitch who crossed you.

50:12.300 --> 50:13.510
You little shithead.

50:15.345 --> 50:17.305
Want me to cross you one last time?

50:17.389 --> 50:18.473
Let go of me.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.142
Please.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.810
Quit trembling, you jerk.

50:21.893 --> 50:23.395
He'll kill you if you get caught.

50:23.478 --> 50:24.938
Green Light.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.189
Red Light.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.366
Green Light.

50:36.450 --> 50:37.451
Red Light.

50:37.951 --> 50:40.704
Help, please. I don't wanna die.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.040
Let go. What are you doing?

50:43.123 --> 50:44.249
Please, help.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.461
Help me.

50:48.795 --> 50:50.172
Green Light.

50:50.881 --> 50:51.923
Red Light.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.847
Green Light.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.058
Red Light.

51:34.633 --> 51:38.887
Green Light. Red Light.
