[SLURPS] Mmm.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.349
This is such bullshit.

00:11.350 --> 00:14.110
How many other cops are here
waiting for this raid?

00:14.111 --> 00:17.110
This is our raid, our moment!
We were here from the beginning.

00:17.111 --> 00:19.590
Look how far back we are.
We've got a terrible position.

00:19.591 --> 00:22.190
We should be at the front,
the front car, the only car!

00:22.191 --> 00:23.911
- Hendy.
- It's our operation.

00:23.912 --> 00:26.031
- Adapt or die.
- It just makes me mad.

00:26.032 --> 00:27.831
- Be like the goldfish.
- Hmm?

00:27.832 --> 00:30.791
You know goldfish?
They adapt or they die.

00:30.792 --> 00:34.754
Like, you put a goldfish
in a small bowl, it grows small.

00:34.779 --> 00:36.578
Put a goldfish in a large bowl,

00:36.579 --> 00:40.858
that very same goldfish, like,
a swimming pool, it grows large.

00:40.859 --> 00:43.579
It understands its surroundings
and it adapts, all right?

00:43.580 --> 00:45.379
It does not buck the system.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.539
It doesn't get a head
full of goldfish steam

00:47.540 --> 00:49.499
and want to be a large-ish fish.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.579
It's happy with being a goldfish.

00:52.079 --> 00:54.791
Well, that's the problem.
I'm not a goldfish.

00:54.927 --> 00:58.726
I'm a shark and they've
put me in a goldfish bowl.

00:58.727 --> 01:01.206
You know how frustrating
that is for the shark?

01:01.207 --> 01:04.566
I just wanna eat and keep moving
and never sleep and keep moving.

01:04.568 --> 01:06.287
And never swim backwards.

01:06.288 --> 01:08.087
Never swim backwards.
Always move forwards.

01:08.088 --> 01:09.985
Or you could be a handsome dolphin.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.181
I don't wanna be a dolphin. I'm a shark.

01:16.263 --> 01:18.902
Oh, you remember that dolphin

01:18.903 --> 01:21.782
I picked up in the hard
rubbish throw-out?

01:21.783 --> 01:24.703
- Mmm.
- Had it in my living room.

01:24.704 --> 01:28.223
- It looks ridiculous.
- Does it? That's weird.

01:28.224 --> 01:30.023
There's a crack in its bum.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.343
It leaked brown water
all over the carpet.

01:32.344 --> 01:35.784
So... I put it out the front yard.

01:35.785 --> 01:38.065
- Huh.
- The circle of life.

01:40.345 --> 01:42.144
Has anyone else picked it up yet?

01:42.145 --> 01:45.312
No. Why would they? It's fucked.

We have 14 units standing by
outside target location.

02:21.011 --> 02:23.291
Two known male associates
inside the warehouse

02:23.292 --> 02:26.131

02:26.132 --> 02:27.892
Won't be long, guys.

02:28.892 --> 02:31.851
You thought any more about maybe
coming down the coast with me?

02:31.852 --> 02:35.212
I wanna follow up on a few leads
first, looking for the old man.

02:35.213 --> 02:37.452
- Going to Esperance.
- Esperance?

02:37.453 --> 02:39.252
- Yeah.
- Really?

02:39.253 --> 02:42.492
Which, funnily enough,
is French for 'hope'.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.973
What, did your mum have
French... She had French in her?

02:44.974 --> 02:46.774
She might have at some stage, yeah.

02:48.014 --> 02:50.333
- Yeah, she got around.
- She really did.

02:50.334 --> 02:53.054
What about you? What about
this small business idea?

02:53.055 --> 02:55.454
Nah, not a small business.
I'm sort of thinking...

02:55.455 --> 02:57.734
There's a little place I love, you know?

02:57.735 --> 02:59.734
- On the Sapphire Coast there.
- Oh, yeah.

02:59.735 --> 03:02.134
You can never get a decent
coffee there. Might just...

03:02.135 --> 03:05.175
Always hard, isn't it, in the
rural areas on that coast drive.

03:05.176 --> 03:08.375
I might just open up a little
shop where you can get coffee.

03:08.853 --> 03:11.415
Nice. Like a cafe?

03:11.416 --> 03:15.496
No, not a cafe. Just a...
shop where you can get coffee.

03:15.497 --> 03:18.376
You know, flat white
or something. Double shot.

03:18.377 --> 03:20.216
You know, just... just coffee.

03:20.217 --> 03:22.336
- Like a coffee shop.
- Not a coffee shop.

03:22.337 --> 03:24.606
Just... just a shop, you know?

03:24.615 --> 03:27.974
So nothing else, just purely coffee?

03:27.975 --> 03:30.614
And just shit that goes
with it, you know?

03:30.615 --> 03:32.855
- What shit?
- Shit people eat, you know?

03:32.856 --> 03:34.775
- Shit people eat with coffee.
- People eat shit?

03:34.776 --> 03:38.015
Yeah, they have a coffee
and they eat shit with it.

03:38.016 --> 03:41.175
- What shit?
- Pastry or something.

03:41.176 --> 03:43.736
- What kind of pastries?
- Oh...

03:43.737 --> 03:46.816
Croissant. Chocolate croissant.

03:46.817 --> 03:49.496
Nothing fancy. Just shit
to have with your coffee.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.497
Maybe... a drawing
or something on the wall.

03:52.498 --> 03:55.641
A painting or something. I don't know.

03:56.242 --> 03:58.903
So it's... kind of an art cafe.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.617
It's not a fuckin' art cafe.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.417
It's not a fuckin' art cafe, all right?

04:02.418 --> 04:04.498
Okay?

04:04.499 --> 04:06.018
It's just a place where you go,

04:06.019 --> 04:08.418
you get coffee, you get shit to eat

04:08.419 --> 04:10.219
and you get a drawing.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.898
So I could... I could go there.

04:13.900 --> 04:18.099
I could get some locally
sourced and roasted beans?

04:18.100 --> 04:20.699
- Mm-hm.
- And a strong latte perhaps.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.500
- Get a pastry, a nutmeg tart.
- Yep, mm-hm.

04:23.501 --> 04:27.786
Look at some... some work
from local artists.

04:27.979 --> 04:29.421
Mm-hm.

04:29.723 --> 04:32.088
Well, I don't know.
I don't mean to offend you.

04:32.113 --> 04:34.394
But I'm pretty sure that's an art cafe.

04:39.543 --> 04:41.101
Why don't you...

04:41.102 --> 04:43.383
why don't you think about
coming down with me?

Yeah. I took Lachy back.

05:12.756 --> 05:14.476
- From Tony?
- Yep.

05:14.477 --> 05:16.916
He's gonna stay with me the whole time.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.076
I can't have him with his dickhead dad.

05:19.077 --> 05:22.476

- So... he's back with me.

05:22.477 --> 05:24.277
That's... That is so great, Carol.

05:24.278 --> 05:27.677
- When... when did that happen?
- This all happened today.

05:27.678 --> 05:30.184
So you took him home, came to work?

05:30.209 --> 05:32.249
No, he's in the car.

05:33.414 --> 05:35.853
- Is... Why?
- Oh, just... you know.

05:35.854 --> 05:37.653
No, bring him in. That's fine.

05:37.654 --> 05:39.453
- No, no, no.
- He was fine last time.

05:39.454 --> 05:41.173

05:41.174 --> 05:42.974
I thought it would be best.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.054
I didn't mind the photos.
He was just fine.

05:45.055 --> 05:46.974
You don't know what he did with them.

05:46.975 --> 05:48.854
- Okay.
- You don't wanna know.

05:48.855 --> 05:50.974
- He's got a 'Tumble' site thing.
- Okay.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.774
He's put it on the Facebooks.

05:52.775 --> 05:54.895
It's... it's "Hot April Nights".

05:54.896 --> 05:57.615
- Wow. Okay.
- Some of it's pretty degrading.

05:57.616 --> 06:01.375
It's your head with
other bodies and... Burgh!

06:01.376 --> 06:04.016
Anyway, 'cause he 'photo-stores' them.

06:04.017 --> 06:07.336
So I wouldn't go googling
yourself any time soon...

06:07.337 --> 06:09.136
APRIL: All right, okay.

06:09.137 --> 06:10.936
Unless you want a bit of a fright.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.977
Is it possible to ask him
to take them down for me?

06:13.978 --> 06:17.017
I don't think he can.
Once the internet's got them...

06:17.018 --> 06:19.297
- Okay.
- That's it.

06:19.298 --> 06:21.937
Maybe it's best he does
stay in the car, then.

06:21.938 --> 06:24.178
- That's probably a good idea.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah!

06:24.179 --> 06:25.978

06:25.979 --> 06:27.778

him back after everything.

06:47.261 --> 06:49.941
That's enough. I got...
I gotta do some stuff.

- I just got a different bean.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.384

- From evidence.

07:18.544 --> 07:20.863

- [CHUCKLES]
- From this operation?

07:22.744 --> 07:25.424

that had the drugs in them.

behind, so... [CLICKS TONGUE]

Oh, that is an interesting...
interesting fact.

07:33.394 --> 07:34.985
What's that?

07:34.986 --> 07:37.305
That by the year 2050, in the UK

07:37.306 --> 07:40.425
there will be no one called Gary.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.026
See, no one's been christened there,

07:43.027 --> 07:45.786
christened "Gary", since 1992

07:45.787 --> 07:51.026
so by the year 2050, the breed
of Garys will be extinct.

07:51.027 --> 07:53.268
Isn't that amazing?

07:54.268 --> 07:57.507
Yeah, so that's it?
There's no Garys by...

07:57.508 --> 07:59.507
By 2050.

07:59.508 --> 08:01.347
That won't be a great loss, will it?

08:01.348 --> 08:05.588
I mean, it's Gary. It's like... Gary.

08:06.713 --> 08:09.268
That was my dad's name.

08:09.269 --> 08:11.068
And it's Lachy's middle name.

08:11.069 --> 08:12.868
Oh, sorry, Carol. I didn't know that.

08:12.869 --> 08:14.709
No, no. You're fine.

- Yeah.

- I've just...

08:36.792 --> 08:39.510
I've gotta get this off my
chest, gotta unburden myself.

08:39.511 --> 08:41.154
- Mate, what's wrong?
- Well...

08:41.163 --> 08:42.780
You can tell me anything.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.589
You know how Wendy and I...

08:44.590 --> 08:46.389
We've been trying to get pregnant.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.749
- Yeah.
- To cure her depression.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.949
- Right.
- Well, she's, um...

08:51.950 --> 08:54.910
You know her ex-husband, the pilot?

08:54.911 --> 08:56.870
- The dead husband. Yep.
- Yeah.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.910
Very handsome man.

08:58.911 --> 09:03.551
He, um... We've been using, uh...

09:03.552 --> 09:07.031
We've been using cups
of the dead husband's semen

09:07.032 --> 09:09.071
to... to try to get her pregnant.

09:09.889 --> 09:11.919
Oh, mate. So your boys aren't swimming?

09:11.944 --> 09:13.784
Oh, no, they're swimming. Yeah.

09:13.809 --> 09:16.992
Like world-class athletes, you know?

09:16.993 --> 09:19.672
High divers. Leapin' from the pond.

09:19.673 --> 09:21.632
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- Yeah?

09:22.069 --> 09:23.633
This guy died, what?

09:23.634 --> 09:25.633
- Eight years ago?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:25.634 --> 09:28.092
How is his sperm still in this world?

09:28.117 --> 09:30.473
Well, it's the pilot semen bank.

09:30.474 --> 09:32.273
- Mmm?
- You heard of that?

09:32.274 --> 09:34.114
- No.
- Really?

09:34.115 --> 09:36.034
I thought everyone knew about it.

09:36.059 --> 09:38.474
- It's a bank of pilot semen.
- Okay.

09:38.475 --> 09:41.354
Yeah, 'cause, you know, pilots
in the cockpit, they're...

09:41.887 --> 09:45.407
The radiation in the cockpit
can affect their... their boys.

09:45.408 --> 09:47.207
They don't swim as well.

09:47.208 --> 09:51.127
So they make them, uh...
they make them store their semen

09:51.128 --> 09:53.328
and they freeze it
at the pilot semen bank.

09:53.329 --> 09:55.888
So we've been going along

09:55.889 --> 10:00.849
and, um, making withdrawals
from the pilot semen bank.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.849
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.769
And you... [STAMMERS]

10:08.770 --> 10:11.689
Why? I mean, you'd be... Why?

10:11.690 --> 10:13.650
- I'm doing this for her, right?
- Right.

10:13.651 --> 10:16.850
Because she loved him
and they were happier days.

10:16.851 --> 10:19.410

10:19.411 --> 10:23.411
if she can have a small
Charles running around...

10:23.412 --> 10:26.451
That's okay with you, to have
a small Charles running around?

10:26.452 --> 10:29.691
Well, I'm hoping it'll be
his head on my body, you know...

10:29.692 --> 10:31.731
It'll probably be his head on his body

10:31.732 --> 10:34.492
unless you're mixing
your boys with his boys.

10:34.493 --> 10:37.052
- Well, that's an option.
- I don't think it is an option.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.852
What would happen there?

10:38.853 --> 10:40.652
Probably a horrific sperm milkshake

10:40.653 --> 10:42.492
would be the outcome there

10:42.493 --> 10:45.533
and I don't think anyone
wants to see that.

10:45.534 --> 10:48.093
No, that sounds messy.

10:48.094 --> 10:51.573

real thing for this ex-husband.

10:51.574 --> 10:54.214
- Almost as much as you do.
- He was a handsome man!

10:54.215 --> 10:56.415
Listen, Stokes.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.469
As your best friend,

10:59.470 --> 11:01.750
it's important that I tell you...

11:02.991 --> 11:07.110
giving another man's semen to your wife

11:07.111 --> 11:09.230
when you have semen

11:09.231 --> 11:13.831
is not an appropriate gift.

11:13.832 --> 11:15.471
Hmm?

11:15.472 --> 11:17.271
And I feel I can tell you that

11:17.272 --> 11:19.311
because I have some insight into you

11:19.312 --> 11:21.471
and I think your sperm's good enough.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.392

than good enough, mate.

- Um...

11:38.754 --> 11:41.313

one of the biggest drug busts

around the block

11:49.755 --> 11:51.554

11:51.555 --> 11:54.035
You've got liquid gold running
through your nuts there.

11:54.036 --> 11:57.155

semen is like manna from heaven.

11:59.956 --> 12:02.435

in your pants there

12:02.436 --> 12:04.676

- You are liquid gold nuts.

gonna call you from now on

I'm a bit scared.

in a safe all sweet?

13:03.628 --> 13:06.027
No, it's up in the paddock bank
in the holes.

- The hole technique.
- What? What do you mean?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.987
I've dug holes. I buried it.

13:10.988 --> 13:12.788
- Sweet, mate.
- Yeah.

13:12.789 --> 13:15.508
So little markers,
little private little markers

13:15.509 --> 13:17.908
so you know exactly
where everything is, all good?

13:17.909 --> 13:21.788
No, no. I mean, even I don't
know where most of it is.

13:21.789 --> 13:23.629
I know where some of it is,

13:23.630 --> 13:25.749
but most of it,
I've got absolutely no idea.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.509
Just dig holes in the dark and leave it.

13:28.510 --> 13:30.829
Remember when I had that
problem with impulse buying?

13:30.830 --> 13:32.629
Remember when I first discovered eBay?

13:32.630 --> 13:34.790
Yeah, yeah, I know.
You were mad on that.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.790
- Yeah.
- The jet ski.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.590
- The jet ski.
- Jet skis.

13:38.591 --> 13:41.110
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- No, fair enough.

13:41.111 --> 13:44.751
Two weeks ago I was watching,
uh, a fishing show

13:44.752 --> 13:48.111
and I'm thinking, "I wanna
start up a tropical fish tank."

13:48.112 --> 13:49.911
So I'm doing a bit of research

13:49.912 --> 13:53.072
and online I find a
5,000-litre fish tank.

13:53.073 --> 13:55.792
It's clad with Italian terrazzo marble.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.872
It's got high-density
fluorescent lights.

13:57.873 --> 14:01.592
It's got an incredibly extensive
double filtration system.

14:01.593 --> 14:03.473
And I'm picturing it,

14:03.474 --> 14:06.313
a lush, tropical, undersea garden,

14:06.314 --> 14:08.313
dozens of small reef sharks,

14:08.314 --> 14:10.753
tetra neons, baby snapper,

14:10.754 --> 14:12.754
sitting there at the end of my bed.

14:12.755 --> 14:15.514
- Oh, shit!
- Like a love-making machine!

14:15.515 --> 14:17.434
- Beautiful.
- So I hop in the car.

14:17.435 --> 14:19.394
- I'm driving up to my paddock.
- Yep.

14:19.395 --> 14:22.154
Four hours, I'm just at the
wheel thinking, "Tropical fish."

14:22.155 --> 14:25.075
- Nothin' but fish.
- "Aquarium. Aquarium. Aquarium."

14:25.076 --> 14:26.875
It's like a white line fever.

14:26.876 --> 14:29.195
I get to the paddock
and I'm diggin' my holes

14:29.196 --> 14:32.515
and I'm thinking seahorses,
I'm thinking crabs,

14:32.516 --> 14:34.636
I'm thinking octopuses.

14:34.637 --> 14:37.356
- Oh, my mind's just goin' crazy!
- Yeah.

14:37.357 --> 14:39.476
- Then I get to the 28th hole.
- Yeah.

14:39.477 --> 14:41.396
And then it hits me,

14:41.397 --> 14:43.437
I fuckin' hate fish.

14:43.438 --> 14:45.397
And that's the beauty of holes.

14:45.398 --> 14:47.957
It takes the impulse
out of impulse buying.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.517
I tossed down that shovel, drove home.

14:50.518 --> 14:52.637
I've saved myself $25,000!

14:52.638 --> 14:56.998
Mate, that's all well and good,
but we really need this money.

14:56.999 --> 15:00.718
Nah. We THINK we need this money.

15:01.313 --> 15:03.673
You wait till you're in your 30th hole.

15:03.698 --> 15:05.498
See how you feel then.

15:08.948 --> 15:10.907
I just got a text from Phil.

15:10.908 --> 15:13.788
Phil? Ex?

15:13.789 --> 15:15.788
Your ex Phil? Ex-fiancé?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.708
That's right. Basically
he says... What did he say?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.588
He said, "I have made a huge mistake,"

15:20.589 --> 15:23.068
and, "Can we try again?" or something.

15:23.069 --> 15:24.829
And I just... I don't know what...

15:24.830 --> 15:27.909
- He wants to get back together?
- I don't think I can go back.

15:27.910 --> 15:30.909
- No?
- Nup. It was toxic.

15:30.910 --> 15:33.710
- It was abusive.
- Oh, that's awful!

15:33.711 --> 15:35.750
It was best I got out, I reckon.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.870
- Yeah!
- 'Cause I'd just hit him.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.242
I would just punch him...

15:40.266 --> 15:42.305
You'd punch him?

15:42.322 --> 15:44.162
- Yeah.
- And what?

15:44.163 --> 15:46.882
'Cause he'd... Would he punch you?

15:46.883 --> 15:49.602
No, no, no, no, no. Um...

15:49.603 --> 15:52.402
No, he just brought out
this violent side in me

15:52.403 --> 15:54.563
and I just can't be bothered
with it, honestly.

15:54.564 --> 15:57.123
It's just... it's just not my best side

15:57.124 --> 16:02.083
and, um, we'd just fight about
the same thing and it was...

16:02.084 --> 16:04.524
The main fight we used to have
was over hot sauce.

16:04.525 --> 16:05.929
Hot sauce?

16:05.937 --> 16:10.056
Yeah, like, habanero
or Tabasco or chipotle...

16:10.057 --> 16:12.016
No, I know what hot sauce is.

16:13.017 --> 16:14.778
Okay, well, um...

16:15.238 --> 16:17.777
Yeah, he'd just leave it out
and it says plain as day

16:17.778 --> 16:20.137
on the bottle,
"Refrigerate after opening."

16:20.138 --> 16:21.937
He knew it bothered me.

16:21.938 --> 16:23.738
I'd come home from work most days

16:23.739 --> 16:26.698
and it would be there on the
table, you know what I mean?

16:26.699 --> 16:30.898
And it just... it just really
got to me and it just...

16:30.899 --> 16:34.659
And one night I got home
and there it was on the table

16:34.660 --> 16:38.979
and I just lost it, just laid into him.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.179
Kicked him in the guts
a couple of times.

16:41.180 --> 16:44.300
Punched him across the face.
There was quite a bit of blood.

16:44.301 --> 16:46.500
So after that he'd put
the hot sauce away.

16:46.501 --> 16:49.861
But the love was gone.
Something was broken.

16:51.421 --> 16:54.182

have to keep it in the fridge.

16:55.739 --> 16:57.658

16:57.659 --> 17:01.218
