COME ON. IS THIS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANTED?

23:40.462 --> 23:41.942
UNH!

23:49.863 --> 23:52.213
[BOTH GRUNTING]

24:02.528 --> 24:04.573
I'M TAKING
MY MONEY BACK.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.662
THAT'S ENOUGH!

24:06.706 --> 24:09.448
EASY, STAR CITY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FIGHT.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.101
-HE WON.
-YOU SAW THE BLATANT DISRESPECT

24:11.145 --> 24:12.451
AT THE TABLE.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.756
IN GOTHAM CITY,
WE HOLD THE LINE

24:13.800 --> 24:15.149
AGAINST PUNKS
LIKE THIS.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.325
OHH! ERGH!

24:19.806 --> 24:21.503
I HEAR YOU SHOT HIM
THE OTHER DAY,

24:21.547 --> 24:23.723
AND NOW YOU'RE UPSET
THAT HE'S NOT SHOWING
YOU RESPECT?

24:33.646 --> 24:35.604
OHH!

24:35.648 --> 24:38.389
UM...

24:38.433 --> 24:40.304
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.307
I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

24:43.351 --> 24:46.397
RYAN: I THINK SHE'S
STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE THINGS OUT.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.879
OH. YEAH.
OF COURSE. RIGHT.

24:49.923 --> 24:53.404
JUST ANY QUESTIONS
YOU HAVE, I'M HERE

24:53.448 --> 24:55.494
OR NOT, YOU KNOW.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.148
I'M NOT TRYING
TO SMOTHER YOU.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.411
-I NEED A DRINK.
-I...

25:03.676 --> 25:05.068
DID YOU FIND MY DAD?

25:05.112 --> 25:06.896
NO. SHE SAID A BUNCH
OF FALSE FACE GOONS

25:06.940 --> 25:08.507
RAIDED THE JOINT.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.421
THEN SHE DESCRIBED SOMEONE
WEARING A HAIR CHAIN

25:10.465 --> 25:12.380
AND HOLDING TWO
BIG-ASS SWORDS.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.861
-TATIANA.
-SHE THINKS TATIANA

25:14.904 --> 25:16.036
WANTED ALICE.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.559
ALICE WAS
AT THE CROWS

25:17.603 --> 25:19.213
WITH--WITH MY DAD?

25:19.256 --> 25:21.171

IS HAPPENING?

25:21.215 --> 25:22.738
SOPHIE: KATE?

25:26.742 --> 25:28.570
OK. DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.485
THERE'S STILL A LOT
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

SOPHIE.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.409
WHOA.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.678
SO ALICE JUST TOLD
YOU ABOUT SOME MUG,

25:49.722 --> 25:51.201
AND THAT WAS IT, REALLY?

25:51.245 --> 25:53.552
ALICE? REALLY?

25:53.595 --> 25:56.859
UHH. WHERE IS
MY FATHER?

25:56.903 --> 26:00.210
OK. LET'S CHILL.
JUST GIVE HER A MINUTE.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.082
SOPHIE: HEY.
WE KNOW IT'S A LOT.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.431
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SIT DOWN.

26:03.474 --> 26:05.346

AGH!

26:15.095 --> 26:18.054
WHERE ARE YOU?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.752
WHERE DID YOU GO?

26:27.629 --> 26:29.588
I THINK YOU'VE CAUSED
QUITE ENOUGH TROUBLE.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.332
MARY: HEY, KATE.
YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE SAFE, OK?

-EVERYONE OK?
-EVERYONE BUT KATE.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.267
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

26:57.311 --> 27:00.531
I THINK KATE AND CIRCE
ARE DUKING IT OUT IN HER HEAD,

27:00.575 --> 27:01.968
AND CIRCE'S WINNING
RIGHT NOW.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.447
SO IF ALICE IS
THE LYNCHPIN

27:03.491 --> 27:05.362
TO JOGGING MORE
OF KATE'S MEMORIES

27:05.406 --> 27:07.321
-AND SAFIYAH HAS HER--
-NO, NO, NO.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.671
EVEN IF I COULD STOMACH
THE IDEA

27:09.715 --> 27:12.282
OF SAVING ALICE'S LIFE
RIGHT NOW,

27:12.326 --> 27:14.110
SAFIYAH CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM CORYANA

27:14.154 --> 27:16.809
FOR THE PYRO WHO TORCHED
HER ENTIRE KINGDOM,

27:16.852 --> 27:18.462
SO WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY
OFFER HER

27:18.506 --> 27:20.203
THAT WOULD BE BETTER
THAN THAT, HMM?

27:20.247 --> 27:21.683
GOTHAM STEAKHOUSE
GIFT CARD OR--

27:21.727 --> 27:24.947
SHE COULD REBUILD
THAT KINGDOM...

27:24.991 --> 27:28.559
IF I GIVE HER
THE DESERT ROSE.

27:28.603 --> 27:31.562

IT'S YOUR
LAST CONNECTION
TO YOUR MOM.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.481
YOU'RE REALLY WILLING
TO DO THAT?

27:37.525 --> 27:39.701
WILLING IS PUSHING IT.

27:39.745 --> 27:43.313
MORE LIKE WE DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
TO BARGAIN WITH.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.707
EVEN IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO MAKE THE TRADE,

27:45.751 --> 27:47.143
HOW DO WE EVEN
FIND HER?

27:47.187 --> 27:49.537
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD EXCUSE
TO SHOW LUKE

27:49.580 --> 27:52.235
JUST HOW BADLY
HIS FRIENDS NEED HIM.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.024
HEY. YOU GOOD?

27:58.067 --> 27:59.590
YEAH.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.162
YOUR OLD MAN'S
LUCIUS FOX, RIGHT?

28:06.206 --> 28:07.816
PUT TOGETHER
SOME DETAILS WHEN
YOU WERE HAVING

28:07.860 --> 28:11.037
THAT FRIENDLY GAME
OF HOLD 'EM. HEH HEH HEH.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.999
YOU LOST YOUR
OLD MAN YOUNG.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.348
THAT'S--THAT'S
HARD, MAN.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.046
THAT'S REAL HARD.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.743
MY OLD MAN WAS
A MARINE DEPLOYED
OVERSEAS

28:21.787 --> 28:24.050
WHEN I WAS A BOY,
KILLED IN ACTION.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.576
-I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
-IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.014
BUT IT LEFT ME
WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS

28:32.058 --> 28:34.364
ABOUT HIM AND ME,

28:34.408 --> 28:36.192
SO I GET IT
WHEN THOSE QUESTIONS
BECOME MORE IMPORTANT

28:36.236 --> 28:37.846
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD, MAN.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.065
BELIEVE ME, I GET IT.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.023
WHAT YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER IS THAT

28:41.067 --> 28:45.027
WE ALL END UP
IN THE SAME PLACE
EVENTUALLY, MAN,

28:45.071 --> 28:48.552
AND YOU'LL SEE
YOUR FATHER SOON ENOUGH.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.250
WHAT CHANGES WITH TIME IS
WHAT YOU GET TO TELL HIM

28:50.293 --> 28:51.860
YOU DID WHILE YOU WERE
ON THE EARTH.

28:51.904 --> 28:55.472
OK. SO...I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO IGNORE THE FACT

28:55.516 --> 28:56.952
THAT I'M STILL
ANGRY AS HELL?

28:56.996 --> 28:59.041
NO, BROTHER.
DON'T IGNORE IT. USE IT.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.870

FOR THE GREAT FOX FAMILY.

29:01.914 --> 29:04.394
YOU STAND FOR JUSTICE.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.701
YOU'RE GONNA NEED ANGER
TO WIN THAT FIGHT.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.665
-YOU OK?
-YEAH. YEAH.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.407
JUST SOME, UM,
FOGGINESS, DIZZINESS.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.583
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.238
LIFETIME OF ANGER HAS
ITS SIDE EFFECTS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:22.282 --> 29:24.066
YOU KNOW WE HAVE
A WORLD-RENOWNED
NEUROLOGY DEPARTMENT

29:24.110 --> 29:26.286
AT GOTHAM GENERAL?

29:26.329 --> 29:27.809
I CAN GET YOU
A CONNECT IF YOU WANT.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.289
THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I'M HERE.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.986
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
IN THE MORNING.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.170
IS IT SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

29:41.214 --> 29:43.999
NO. THAT'S
HIGHLY UNUSUAL.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.261
IN FACT, I THINK
IT'S--

29:45.305 --> 29:46.785
IT'S MORSE CODE.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.830

JOHN: FOX...

29:48.874 --> 29:50.136

29:54.357 --> 29:56.272
I SHOULD GO.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.144

PRETTY IMPORTANT
FOR A MAN

29:58.187 --> 30:01.103

HIS ASS KICKED
IN AN ALLEY.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.453
GOOD THING
YOU'RE ALIVE.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.890

30:07.718 --> 30:09.633
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

DEWITT: HELLO. THIS IS
DANA DEWITT,

30:11.505 --> 30:13.333
AND I'M COMING TO YOU LIVE
FROM GRAND STREET DOWNTOWN

30:13.376 --> 30:15.639
OUTSIDE OF GCPD HEADQUARTERS.

30:15.683 --> 30:18.642
EARLIER TODAY, WE GOT WORD
OF THE SHOCKING ARREST

30:18.686 --> 30:20.383
OF FORMER CROWS COMMANDER
JACOB KANE,

30:20.427 --> 30:23.169
WHO IS RUMORED TO BE--
THERE HE IS.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.823
MR. KANE, IS IT TRUE
YOU'RE THE FATHER

30:24.866 --> 30:27.347
OF ONE OF GOTHAM'S
MOST NOTORIOUS MONSTERS?

30:29.175 --> 30:30.916
JACOB: IT'S NOT LIKE
THAT, DANA.

30:36.269 --> 30:40.839
YES, SHE'S MY DAUGHTER,
AND HER NAME IS BETH.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.971
SHE'S NOT A MONSTER.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.408
SHE'S A VICTIM
OF EVIL MEN AND WOMEN

30:45.452 --> 30:48.498
WHO STOLE HER CHILDHOOD
AND MANIPULATED HER MIND,

30:48.542 --> 30:51.675
OF A FATHER WHO--
WHO DIDN'T COME
THROUGH FOR HER

30:51.719 --> 30:53.242
WHEN SHE NEEDED HIM.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.679
BETH HAS HAD
THE HARDEST LIFE

30:55.723 --> 30:57.159
OF ANYONE
I'VE EVER KNOWN,

30:57.203 --> 31:01.685
AND YET...SHE HAS
THIS HUMANITY INSIDE OF HER.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.384
I CAN'T IMAGINE
EVER HAVING THAT STRENGTH,

31:04.427 --> 31:08.518
SO IF GOTHAM IS ANGRY
AT ME, THEN SO BE IT.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.521
I ASK ONLY THIS OF THEM
AS A FATHER.

31:11.565 --> 31:15.177
WHEN YOU JUDGE ALICE
FOR HER CRIMES,

31:15.221 --> 31:16.875
REMEMBER BETH.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.230
TATIANA: SHE'S IN HERE,
MY QUEEN.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.190
MY DEAR...

31:28.234 --> 31:31.063
I BELIEVE YOU OWE
ME AN ISLAND.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.809
OW, OW, OW, OW, OW!
UGH! OW!

31:38.853 --> 31:40.376
OOH. THIS IS DEEP.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.117
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GET HIT?

31:42.161 --> 31:43.814
YOU SHOULD'VE
SAW HIM, OK?

31:43.858 --> 31:46.643
DIDN'T REALIZE POKER
WAS A CONTACT SPORT.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.648
WASN'T THERE
AN EMERGENCY?

31:51.692 --> 31:54.738
SAFIYAH'S HOLDING ALICE
SOMEWHERE IN GOTHAM,

31:54.782 --> 31:56.915
SO WE NEED YOUR
BRILLIANT DECODER BRAIN

31:56.958 --> 31:59.569
TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO FIND HER...

31:59.613 --> 32:01.571
AND SAVE HER.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.399
OK. I GIVE UP.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.358
WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

32:14.019 --> 32:15.672
KATE'S STILL ALIVE.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.642
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
OF CORYANA.

32:28.685 --> 32:31.950
YOUR SCORCHING
WAS THOROUGH AND COMPLETE.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.343
9 VILLAGERS PERISHED
IN THE BLAZE,

32:34.387 --> 32:36.519
SO IF YOU HAVE MANAGED
TO MAINTAIN A LIST

32:36.563 --> 32:38.652
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
DO INCLUDE THEM

32:38.695 --> 32:40.654
IN YOUR GRAND TOTAL.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.483
YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD
MY SISTER.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.137
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

32:45.180 --> 32:48.140
IF I'M HONEST,
THAT,

32:48.183 --> 32:49.968
A TANTRUM

32:50.011 --> 32:51.665
BECAUSE AT THE END
OF THE DAY, ALICE,

32:51.708 --> 32:53.623
YOU'RE JUST
A SPOILED CHILD

32:53.667 --> 32:55.408
WHO BELIEVES
SHE DESERVES MORE
THAN SHE'S EARNED.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.629
WHAT IS THIS?

32:59.673 --> 33:01.980
CHILL. I COME IN PEACE.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.242
LET HER IN.

33:04.591 --> 33:05.809
[SIGHS]

33:05.853 --> 33:07.681
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

33:11.859 --> 33:13.730
I'VE HAD THIS PLANT
A LONG TIME.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.297
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT WAS
OR WHAT IT COULD DO

33:15.341 --> 33:18.344
UNTIL RECENTLY,
BUT EVEN BEFORE I KNEW,

33:18.387 --> 33:20.128
IT WAS MY
FAVORITE THING
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.521
AND WHY IS THAT?

33:21.564 --> 33:24.176
A WOMAN I COUNTED
AS MY MOTHER,

33:24.219 --> 33:26.352
SHE DIED A WHILE BACK,
AND THIS PLANT WAS

33:26.395 --> 33:29.529
MY LAST CONNECTION
TO HER.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.487
AND YET YOU BROUGHT IT
TO OFFER

33:31.531 --> 33:34.882
IN WHAT I PRESUME
IS A TRADE FOR ALICE?

33:37.189 --> 33:39.843
YOUR ENEMY.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.410
ALICE IS THE KEY
TO GETTING

33:41.454 --> 33:43.151
HER SISTER'S
MEMORIES BACK.

33:43.195 --> 33:45.849
THE CHOICE IS EASY.
REVENGE IS SHORT-LIVED,

33:45.893 --> 33:47.155
BUT REBUILDING
YOUR ISLAND,

33:47.199 --> 33:49.331
IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.334
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHAT'S IN THIS FOR YOU.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.510
I SEE SOMEONE GIVING UP
HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION

33:54.554 --> 33:56.425
TO SAVE A WOMAN SHE HATES

33:56.469 --> 33:58.166
TO UNLOCK THE MEMORIES
OF ANOTHER WOMAN

33:58.210 --> 33:59.689
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

33:59.733 --> 34:03.084
IT'S EITHER REMARKABLE
OR REMARKABLY STUPID.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.173
I KNOW WHAT KATE KANE
STANDS FOR,

34:05.217 --> 34:09.177
AND I OWE A DEBT
TO THE SYMBOL
SHE CREATED.

34:09.221 --> 34:12.528
FOUND MY SECOND CHANCE
AT A LIFE BECAUSE OF HER.

34:12.572 --> 34:16.967
I'VE NEVER MET HER,
BUT...I BELIEVE

34:17.011 --> 34:20.058
YOU'D MAKE
KATE KANE PROUD.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.799
I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.

34:31.504 --> 34:32.809
IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU,

34:32.853 --> 34:35.986
AT LEAST I CAN
HAVE MY KINGDOM.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.859
THANK YOU...MY QUEEN.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.821
I'LL MAKE SURE TO TELL
OCEAN YOU SEND YOUR REGARDS.

34:44.865 --> 34:47.085
ALICE, LET'S GO.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.744
IT'S FUNNY.

34:54.788 --> 34:57.138
HERE YOU ARE
A LITERAL QUEEN,

34:57.182 --> 35:01.403
AND YET I HAVE
MY BOYFRIEND
AND MY SISTER,

35:01.447 --> 35:04.102
AND ALL YOU HAVE
IS A LITTLE FLOWER.

35:04.145 --> 35:08.280
OH, THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
BELIEVING YOU DESERVE
MORE THAN YOU'VE EARNED.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.373
