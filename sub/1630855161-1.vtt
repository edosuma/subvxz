02:10.120 --> 02:12.840
- Carol? Carol?
- Michael?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.000
What the hell are you doing here?
You thought I was gonna let you

02:16.000 --> 02:17.080
What the hell are you doing here?
You thought I was gonna let you

02:17.080 --> 02:19.760
do this on your own, did you?

02:19.760 --> 02:22.960
Did you? Is that what you thought?
Go get the bags.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.680
Hold on, have you spoken to Keenan?
Look, forget about Keenan.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.000
It's just us now, love.
- It's just us.
- Do you mean it?

02:32.000 --> 02:32.280
It's just us now, love.
- It's just us.
- Do you mean it?

02:32.280 --> 02:33.800
Of course I mean it.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.080
I mean it.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.000
Watch yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.280
Watch yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.520
Christ.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.000
You've got great timing

02:48.000 --> 02:49.360
You've got great timing

02:49.360 --> 02:51.400
You're the one that's early!

02:55.360 --> 02:56.000
- My love.
- What the fuck is that?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.600
- My love.
- What the fuck is that?

02:58.600 --> 03:01.000
Don't worry,
I'll get rid of it down south.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.400
Oh, yeah. Like that'll be of use
in the hospital

03:11.040 --> 03:12.000
Weapon sighted.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.040
Weapon sighted.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.240
Bandit's
heading south.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.400
Christ! Has this
thing got square wheels or what?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.720
Don't fly anywhere, love.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.000
Just you hold onto the wee fella.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.840
Just you hold onto the wee fella.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.960
I don't want him bouncing out!

03:50.200 --> 03:52.000
Oh, it's good to see you.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.200
Oh, it's good to see you.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.320
You know I didn't wanna do this
without you.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.720
What? What is it?

04:14.280 --> 04:16.000
Shit.
You can lose them in the woods.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.520
Shit.
You can lose them in the woods.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.920
Carol, I'm not leaving you.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.240
- Just go. Just go, please!
- I'm not
leaving you with them fuckers.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.000
I know, Michael, but if you stay,
we don't stand a chance, OK?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.360
I know, Michael, but if you stay,
we don't stand a chance, OK?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.880
They're not after me.
Go on, please, Michael!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Go!

04:52.760 --> 04:54.520
Go! Go! Go!

04:57.560 --> 04:59.120
British Army!

05:00.920 --> 05:03.440
O'Hara, do not move!

06:48.560 --> 06:51.680
Major fucking propaganda victory for
the Republicans, Tempest.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.040
What the hell happened?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.080
Intel reported a weapon in the car.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.000
Sir, SIB'S at the gate.
- Shall I let them in?
- No.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.800
Sir, SIB'S at the gate.
- Shall I let them in?
- No.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.720
You don't expect us to believe that?
- The Bandit had six kills.
- Seven.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.000
- Sir?
- Ryan didn't make it.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.120
- Sir?
- Ryan didn't make it.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.600
But your bandit did.
Fuck knows where he is.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.880
Go on.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.440
British Army! O'Hara, do not move!

07:15.440 --> 07:18.280
We were tipped off about his
location but

07:18.280 --> 07:20.000
when we moved in,
we found the vehicle abandoned.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.640
when we moved in,
we found the vehicle abandoned.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.000
I thought I was facing
an imminent threat, sir.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.080
I thought I was facing
an imminent threat, sir.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.440
You thought
you were going to be shot?

07:31.440 --> 07:35.040
That was my reading of the
situation. I was about to be shot.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.480
By a pregnant woman in labour?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.880
Sir, SIB are-Fuck off!

07:46.320 --> 07:49.320
Well, that's that, then.
Glad we sorted that out.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.640
This shitshow doesn't end

07:50.640 --> 07:52.000
with us hoicking Snowy here
out in a chopper.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.680
with us hoicking Snowy here
out in a chopper.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.720
We don't have that authority.
No you don't but I do.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.560
Tempest, would you wait outside?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.760
Can I have the room?

08:29.680 --> 08:32.000
- This room?
- Get out.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.720
- This room?
- Get out.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.640
Soldiers are here
in support of the civil power.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.000
They have no legal authority beyond
that of an ordinary civilian.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
They have no legal authority beyond
that of an ordinary civilian.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.960
Any actions they take

08:51.960 --> 08:54.520
must be in accordance with
the laws of the United Kingdom

08:54.520 --> 08:56.000
and are, in fact,
punishable by those laws.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.680
and are, in fact,
punishable by those laws.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.440
I'm aware of the yellow card, sir.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.120
Good...

09:03.120 --> 09:04.000
...because YOU are about to be
prosecuted for murder.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.440
...because YOU are about to be
prosecuted for murder.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.000
There are... two ways out of this.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.960
There are... two ways out of this.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.200
One, we open that door.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.000
We let SIB in to rip you apart.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.560
We let SIB in to rip you apart.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.160
Your commanding officers,
they'll try and protect you

09:23.160 --> 09:24.680
but you'll cease to be a soldier.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.000
You'll spend the next three years
sharpening pencils

09:28.000 --> 09:28.520
You'll spend the next three years
sharpening pencils

09:28.520 --> 09:31.240
for a bunch of lawyers and
THEN you'll probably go to prison.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.680
OR...

09:36.960 --> 09:39.640
...you come and work for me.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.760
I'm putting together a detachment.
I could use a dead shot like you.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.200
And what about all this?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.000
I'll make it go away.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.400
You make it sound easy, sir.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.360
I assure you
it'll be anything but easy...

09:55.640 --> 09:58.720
But you'll continue to serve your
country and do what you do best.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.000
Where do I report, sir?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.240
Where do I report, sir?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.120
It's not really...
that sort of thing.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.920
Do you have somewhere you can stay
off grid?

10:18.920 --> 10:21.400
Somewhere that isn't the barracks?
I do.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.000
Good.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.960
Good.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
Good. I'll see you in London.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.000
CAROL'S VOICE:
Michael, I'm right here, darling.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.200
CAROL'S VOICE:
Michael, I'm right here, darling.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.560
I'm right here. Look.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.000
It's OK, Michael.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.480
It's OK, Michael.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.760
Look, you had to go.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.000
'Shops and offices were closed

14:08.000 --> 14:08.160
'Shops and offices were closed

14:08.160 --> 14:10.560
as hundreds of people
lined the route of the funeral.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.120
In the Church of the Sacred Heart,

14:12.120 --> 14:14.720
the circumstances of
Carol's shooting were referred to

14:14.720 --> 14:16.000
by Father Joe McVeigh as a day of
tragedy that had touched everyone-'

14:16.000 --> 14:18.240
by Father Joe McVeigh as a day of
tragedy that had touched everyone-'

14:19.520 --> 14:22.040
We're so sorry for your loss.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.440
Look... I'm not a doctor. I'm a vet.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.000
Cats and dogs. You'll need someone
to check those wounds for you.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.640
Cats and dogs. You'll need someone
to check those wounds for you.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.840
- Thank you.
- Michael?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.720
There is another way, you know?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.120
There was.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.000
Not any more.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.160
Not any more.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.280
Orla McShawn, Colm McNeish.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.000
What the hell are you playing at
turning up here like this?

15:28.000 --> 15:28.360
What the hell are you playing at
turning up here like this?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.400
I thought you were dead.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.880
I have business
with the man that killed Carol.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.840
Brits flew him to London.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.000
I need you to get me there.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.560
I need you to get me there.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.720
I'm sorry but you wanted out, Michael.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.000
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're
not gonna like what it takes.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.800
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're
not gonna like what it takes.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.000
But I could use a man
they think is dead.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.600
But I could use a man
they think is dead.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.200
I'm taking Twomey.
Peadar Twomey's got problems.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.840
Not with me he hasn't.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.160
If we're to do this...

16:11.160 --> 16:14.520
there'll be no more talk of getting
out until I say so, understood?

16:16.920 --> 16:19.520
I need you to SAY it.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Understood.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.960
And, Michael?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.000
I'm gonna need that ring.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.920
Just give me
the name of that soldier.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.160
Sheila went back with her mother.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.200
Didn't like it...
stuck all the way out here.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.040
Still...
I have the dog, I suppose.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.000
Best dog I've ever had.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.080
Best dog I've ever had.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.160
I heard about Carol.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
Fucking bastards.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.000
I'm heading over the water.
I want you to come.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.560
I'm heading over the water.
I want you to come.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.640
Keenan's putting us with a unit.
I can't.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
The dog would miss me too much.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.360
You know, he'd be lost without me.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.000
I'm going after the soldier
that killed Carol.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.520
I need your help.

For now... I'm going to be sending
someone else, OK?

24:17.520 --> 24:19.480
Morning, Fiadh.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.560
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.880
Your son is dead.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.600
Michael died as a result of injuries

24:43.600 --> 24:45.640
he sustained
in the ambush with Carol.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.280
We'll take care
of all the arrangements.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.000
I'm afraid it won't be
possible to see the body.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.520
I'm afraid it won't be
possible to see the body.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.000
The organisation sends you
its deepest sympathy.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.400
The organisation sends you
its deepest sympathy.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.120
15 he was,
when you took him from me.

25:13.320 --> 25:17.000
He should be here now doing this
while I fix the tea.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.000
We've been selling milk
for nearly 80 years

25:20.000 --> 25:21.240
We've been selling milk
for nearly 80 years

25:21.240 --> 25:23.480
north of the border,
south of the border.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.640
When you and your lot finish your
games of lying and killing,

25:27.640 --> 25:28.000
these cows will still be here.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.680
these cows will still be here.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.760
And people will still drink milk.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.880
You ever set foot on my land again...

25:39.880 --> 25:41.920
I'll shoot you dead, so help me God.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.640
You got another boyfriend or
- something?
- Uh-uh.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.000
One sec!

26:56.000 --> 26:57.360
One sec!

27:15.240 --> 27:18.680
Good morning.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.000
- Is Tempest here?
- Erm...

27:20.000 --> 27:22.200
- Is Tempest here?
- Erm...

27:22.200 --> 27:24.560
Would you mind fetching him for me, please?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.960
Who the hell is this guy?
Army stuff.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.240
How did he know you're here?
I told him.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.920
What?

27:40.920 --> 27:44.000
I told him that if... if I wasn't
here, you know where to find me.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
I told him that if... if I wasn't
here, you know where to find me.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.520
I'm sorry.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.000
Sir?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.560
Sir?

27:55.920 --> 28:00.000
Make yourself at home
Sir, this is... Ruth.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.360
Make yourself at home
Sir, this is... Ruth.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.520
Yes. We just met.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.920
Right. Shall we go?

28:12.440 --> 28:14.800
I'll explain later.
Damn right you will.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.600
I hope...
I hope I wasn't interrupting.

28:52.600 --> 28:56.000
You weren't, sir.
Call me Holland.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.480
You weren't, sir.
Call me Holland.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.000
What's the situation, sir?
There's no situation.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.760
What's the situation, sir?
There's no situation.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.200
We're just going for a look-see.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.000
Do you know...
I've never been to Kentish Town.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.760
Do you know...
I've never been to Kentish Town.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.000
Two teas, please, love.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.720
Two teas, please, love.

29:37.760 --> 29:42.520
Biggest mugs you've got.
Tempest, Lance Corporal Cole.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.640
Beginning to think you were gonna
miss the party.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.480
- How many?
- Not sure.
And where are they?

29:51.480 --> 29:52.000
Number 34, just over the way.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.640
Number 34, just over the way.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.680
Third floor. First flat on the left.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.000
Watching television.
What do you think, boys?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.200
Watching television.
What do you think, boys?

30:03.760 --> 30:06.440
Time to ask a few questions?

30:31.560 --> 30:32.000
Have you got any idea who they are?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.600
Have you got any idea who they are?

30:33.600 --> 30:36.000
Hard to see the rank under the civvies.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.280
I was hoping you'd tell me.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.000
Didn't even have time to pack a bag.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.560
Didn't even have time to pack a bag.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.360
Quick as you can, they said.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.000
More like, hurry up and wait.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.400
More like, hurry up and wait.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.000
Gas man.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.480
Gas man.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.800
This is a job
for the fucking police.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.640
Cole.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.160
# Camberwick Green Theme Music

32:06.640 --> 32:08.000
'This is Captain Snort
of Pippin Fort.'

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
'This is Captain Snort
of Pippin Fort.'

32:09.000 --> 32:11.040
'He's come to give his order
for the week.'

32:12.000 --> 32:15.480
Four dozen loaves of bread,
that's 48, two dozen currant buns,

32:15.480 --> 32:16.000
...that's 24, a dozen...'

32:16.000 --> 32:17.520
...that's 24, a dozen...'

32:21.000 --> 32:23.720
'Very good, sir. I can get your
orders delivered today.'

32:25.040 --> 32:26.800
Grenade!

33:13.560 --> 33:15.600
Can I see your passport, please, sir?

33:20.560 --> 33:23.400
- Where do you live?
- Belfast.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.920
And what's the purpose
of your visit?

33:25.920 --> 33:28.000
I'm looking up an old friend.
- Another Mick?
- English.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.040
I'm looking up an old friend.
- Another Mick?
- English.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.080
And why have you come over
to see him?

33:33.560 --> 33:35.560
He doesn't have long to live.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.240
...through the wrong bloody door!

33:51.240 --> 33:52.000
Tempest. Excellent work.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.760
Tempest. Excellent work.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.800
Do you fancy some tea?
I don't want any tea.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.000
I want someone to tell me
what the fuck is going on, sir.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.640
I want someone to tell me
what the fuck is going on, sir.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.000
McGill and Miller.
They were Belfast. The IRA.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.920
McGill and Miller.
They were Belfast. The IRA.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.080
And they've been giving London
a taste of the Troubles

34:14.080 --> 34:16.000
since the spring.
A bomb a week, random targets.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.880
since the spring.
A bomb a week, random targets.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.480
Department stores,
restaurants, nightclubs.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.880
And he was shot on his own doorstep

34:22.880 --> 34:24.000
assassinated in broad daylight
in the United Kingdom.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.680
assassinated in broad daylight
in the United Kingdom.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.880
The country's not seen bloodshed
on this scale since the war.

34:31.640 --> 34:32.000
Number 10's had enough.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.840
Number 10's had enough.

34:33.840 --> 34:37.720
They wanna fight back...
on their terms. Dirty.

34:37.720 --> 34:40.000
Like the filthy animals they are.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.680
Like the filthy animals they are.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.680
And given that our boys

34:42.680 --> 34:45.920
aren't exactly equipped...
for this kind of business...

34:45.920 --> 34:47.960
We brought you in.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.200
Any more questions?

34:53.200 --> 34:55.240
Did you just call us animals, sir?

34:57.320 --> 34:59.320
You are animals...

35:00.920 --> 35:02.400
...but you're MY animals.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.080
Which reminds me...
your bandit finally showed up.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.000
Buried yesterday.
Full military honours.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.680
Buried yesterday.
Full military honours.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.000
On behalf of the good guys...

35:20.000 --> 35:21.400
On behalf of the good guys...

35:21.400 --> 35:23.440
Cheers.

35:35.880 --> 35:36.000
The lads are expecting you.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.880
The lads are expecting you.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.000
Stay away from the Irish community.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.640
Stay away from the Irish community.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.520
Avoid the pubs and clubs
Irish people go to.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.560
They'll be under surveillance.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.000
The only person we talk to, apart
from other members of the ASU,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.440
The only person we talk to, apart
from other members of the ASU,

35:55.440 --> 35:57.400
is the courier.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.960
- You must be McGill.
- McGill's dead.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.000
Who the fuck are you?

36:40.600 --> 36:44.040
You first.
Quinn, engineer.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.000
What about you, big man?
Liam Hogan, QM.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.680
What about you, big man?
Liam Hogan, QM.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.680
Who the fuck are you?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.360
I'm Joe Lynch.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.000
I'm the driver and I make the tea.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.960
I'm the driver and I make the tea.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.800
They're stopping people
in the street.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.280
They'll pat you down as soon
as they hear your accent.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.000
They'd do a better job than you
then, would they?

37:04.000 --> 37:04.560
They'd do a better job than you
then, would they?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.040
Hey!

37:10.720 --> 37:12.000
Go on, then. I'm listening.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.080
Go on, then. I'm listening.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.160
I'm working with the police.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.000
What? The police? Henry.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.120
What? The police? Henry.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.400
Not exactly WITH but...

37:25.400 --> 37:28.000
..it's complicated.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.240
..it's complicated.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.560
And that guy from this morning,
he's got a bloody nose too?

37:34.040 --> 37:35.360
No, I didn't think so.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.920
You know, my dad used to work for
a man like him.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Superintendent.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.840
Promised him a better life if he
went to fight for king and country

37:50.840 --> 37:52.000
but... when my dad came home,
he got nothing.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.680
but... when my dad came home,
he got nothing.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.040
Just a job
cleaning shit out of toilets.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.000
There's no king or
country for you, Henry.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.320
There's no king or
country for you, Henry.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.320
You're just a black man
in a white man's world.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.000
No-one's looking out for you.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.560
No-one's looking out for you.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.560
The old man sends his regards.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.280
I came here for a name.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.000
I know why you're here
but that was before Kentish Town.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.600
I know why you're here
but that was before Kentish Town.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.200
First you have to deliver a box.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.880
A station. You choose.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.000
That's a big fucking box. It's
gonna take time. I can't be waiting.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.400
That's a big fucking box. It's
gonna take time. I can't be waiting.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.840
We both know
that isn't how it works.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.000
All right.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.560
All right.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.600
I'll do it
but you gotta give me that name.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.000
To be clear,
personal agendas have no place here.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.480
To be clear,
personal agendas have no place here.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.520
Please just give me the name.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.000
Wait! Henry?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Hiya.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not really open.

41:52.000 --> 41:52.320
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not really open.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.040
It's a bit of an emergency. Erm...

41:55.040 --> 41:57.080
I'm looking for something for my wife.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.000
Er... What are you after?

42:00.000 --> 42:00.200
Er... What are you after?

42:01.600 --> 42:05.360
- A dress.
- Do you know what size?

42:07.280 --> 42:08.000
No.

42:08.000 --> 42:08.280
No.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.960
All right, is she bigger or smaller
than me, then?

42:15.160 --> 42:16.000
Erm... she's a little bit smaller
than you.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.560
Erm... she's a little bit smaller
than you.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.640
What colour's her hair?

42:21.760 --> 42:23.760
Red.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.280
And her eyes?

42:29.720 --> 42:31.720
Blue.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.760
Lucky girl.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.000
She sounds beautiful.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.040
She sounds beautiful.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.760
- She was.
- Where is it?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.000
Here it is.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.320
Here it is.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.440
He's in a beige mac.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.080
I swear I saw a gun.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.000
Right, you look that way
and then search this end, yeah?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.240
Right, you look that way
and then search this end, yeah?

43:24.160 --> 43:27.520
There you are. I love that bag.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.800
This way.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.000
What's the matter with you?

43:44.000 --> 43:45.840
What's the matter with you?

43:45.840 --> 43:47.960
She's not even a legitimate target.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.000
The path to freedom has rules.

43:52.000 --> 43:52.960
The path to freedom has rules.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.600
There is a code. You break those
and the objective fails.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.240
The path to freedom?

44:03.360 --> 44:06.080
You really are one of Keenan's
little soldiers, aren't you?

44:08.800 --> 44:12.160
I was top of the class too once.

44:12.160 --> 44:15.400
Except back then, people didn't
talk like a fucking Brit.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.800
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

44:26.360 --> 44:29.400
The man you want is working
for the police hunting your unit.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.000
Right now, my odds are on him.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.520
Right now, my odds are on him.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.000
Have you ever been in love?

44:40.000 --> 44:40.560
Have you ever been in love?

44:44.480 --> 44:46.480
Have you?

44:50.320 --> 44:52.920
I need to kill him.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.960
Then do your job.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.760
Deliver the box.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.640
And he'll come running.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.000
Look at the clip of this. I never
signed up to nanny the police.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.160
Look at the clip of this. I never
signed up to nanny the police.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.280
Yep.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.000
What? Hm?

45:20.000 --> 45:20.280
What? Hm?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I think his nose was thinner...

45:28.000 --> 45:28.280
I think his nose was thinner...

45:28.280 --> 45:30.960
Good girl.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.240
- Henry.
- What are you doing here?

45:33.240 --> 45:34.920
It's... crazy.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.000
They were chasing this guy
in the market, he had a gun.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.360
They were chasing this guy
in the market, he had a gun.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.200
They think
he's one of these Irish guys.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.000
You saw him?
Well, he was in my stall.

45:44.000 --> 45:44.440
You saw him?
Well, he was in my stall.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.000
He was buying a dress for his wife.
What?

45:48.040 --> 45:51.280
- Hey, Henry, what's wrong?
- Just get
home. Cole, take her home.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.000
O'Hara's alive. He went after Ruth.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.000
It's him.
He's here and he's come for me.

46:00.000 --> 46:00.720
It's him.
He's here and he's come for me.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.440
What's the deadline for the evening
- edition?
- Midnight.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.000
Right. Let's flush him out.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.280
Right. Let's flush him out.

46:12.080 --> 46:15.680
When did you last turn the jelly?
It looks like it's ready to weep.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.000
No, they're grand.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.320
No, they're grand.

46:18.320 --> 46:20.440
You should be worrying about the detonators.

46:20.440 --> 46:22.960
We lost them in Kentish Town.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.000
Turn the jelly
and pack it in sawdust.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.560
Turn the jelly
and pack it in sawdust.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.200
...before we get there.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.240
We're hitting Paddington.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.440
Twomey, we need to talk.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.000
Like the station?

46:40.000 --> 46:40.360
Like the station?

46:40.360 --> 46:43.160
No, the fucking bear

46:44.720 --> 46:47.480
He'll be in a blue Rover
coming down Praed Street.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.400
You'll need to be somewhere high.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.120
And we'll need a car, a fast one.

47:01.120 --> 47:04.000
Once I make that call,
we'll have to move quick.

47:04.000 --> 47:04.680
Once I make that call,
we'll have to move quick.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.760
'We're on. He's gonna do it.'

47:25.800 --> 47:28.000
I don't know
what I'd do without you, kitty cat.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.160
I don't know
what I'd do without you, kitty cat.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.040
Tell him not to call it in.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.120
I want it to be a surprise.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.120
A surprise?'Yeah.'

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It's time to scale up.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.560
Too many people
are getting caught up in this.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.880
Just keep it clean.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.000
Make the call.
Give 'em time to get out.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.520
Make the call.
Give 'em time to get out.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.560
I'm only interested
in killing one man.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.120
Are you out of your mind?

48:47.080 --> 48:48.000
You compromise the whole operation
chasing after some fucking para!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.360
You compromise the whole operation
chasing after some fucking para!

48:50.360 --> 48:51.760
Then you come right back here!

48:54.480 --> 48:56.000
If they knew where we were,
they'd be here already.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.040
If they knew where we were,
they'd be here already.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.080
He's going to get us all killed.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.000
- Are you all set?
- I've got my spot.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.560
- Are you all set?
- I've got my spot.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.920
What about the cars?
I got a Cortina.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.960
The kid's a good thief.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
All right then.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.720
- Move today.
- I think you're
forgetting something.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.000
We've no fucking detonators.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.560
We've no fucking detonators.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.120
We do now.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.160
Hey.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.000
No shrapnel.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.840
This is how I always do it.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.000
Not today. We're hitting the
building not the people.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.560
Not today. We're hitting the

for Twomey?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.120
Take the Winchester 308.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.120
She needs a steady hand, that baby.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.000
I know what you're saying.
I'm steady as a fucking rock.

50:08.000 --> 50:08.960
I know what you're saying.
I'm steady as a fucking rock.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.560
- Is this gonna work?
- I don't know.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.160

Yes, madam.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.800
Yes, madam.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.280

51:03.160 --> 51:04.000

Uh-huh.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.160
You know what you're looking for?
Uh-huh.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.760

Just light him up and pin him down.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.000
and I'll put that soldier's head

sleeping with.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.000

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.000
What?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.880
My mum was English.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.000
They met over here.
He was a student.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.680

He was a student.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.920

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.840
...he'd bring Ireland to me.

I'd like to finish this.

I can understand that.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.400
