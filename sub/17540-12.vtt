00:13.914 --> 00:15.347
(crying)

00:15.382 --> 00:17.916
This musical number
meant so much to me.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.852
I know. It was
your moment to shine.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.421
Like the jewels...

00:22.456 --> 00:23.755
which are gone.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.157
I'll stop talking now.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.160
But it wasn't just so I could
share my many talents.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.562
I mean, a little bit,
yes, of course.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.998
I mean, please.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.233
But more than that,
it was supposed to be

00:35.268 --> 00:37.002
my gift to the VKs,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.004
to show how
we were all sisters.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.539
But now it's all ruined.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.174
I wanted to bring
everyone together.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.576
But the VKs
still can't be trusted.

00:44.611 --> 00:47.212
(grunts)
Well, that's actually

00:47.247 --> 00:49.748
-kind of
the un-truth.
-What?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.450
Because Mal wasn't herself.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.051
Jane said Mal
was under a spell

00:53.086 --> 00:55.420
from a cursed jewel
inside the totem from
the island thingy.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.255
So, not her fault.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.391
(gasps)
I feel awful.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.793
I banned her
from the Jewel-bilee, Ally!

01:01.828 --> 01:04.396
I know.
And I understand.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.765
But it's not too late
to make things right.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.268
It ain't over
till the caterpillar sings.

01:10.303 --> 01:14.239
(gasping)
Room... too small.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.208
Running... out of air.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.810
This place is five times
as big as your dorm room.

01:18.845 --> 01:19.878
You're fine.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.379
(groaning)

01:21.414 --> 01:24.616
Ugh. I just can't believe
we're missing the Jewel-bilee.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.618
Do you know how hard it was
to find a belt

01:26.653 --> 01:28.120
that matches my jewel?

01:28.155 --> 01:29.154
You look great.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.790
You know,
from one friend to another.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.892
I can't believe
that maniac Zevon

01:33.927 --> 01:35.827
is up there and we can't
even warn them.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.463
And I can't believe you're
even smaller than usual.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.664
Oh, yeah? Well...

01:39.699 --> 01:42.667
You're not so...
big either.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.970
If there was just some way
to reach the opening.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.404
Yes, there is a way!

01:46.439 --> 01:47.672
Jay, get that table.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.074
Freddie, bring those chairs.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.775
My magic may not
be very reliable...

01:50.810 --> 01:52.444
And often makes things worse.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.645
Not helping.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.814
...but at least I can try.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.116
Take these pillows
and these chairs,

01:58.151 --> 02:00.285
turn them into floating stairs.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.590
All right! It's working!

02:05.625 --> 02:07.693
Shh! She has to concentrate.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.167
Floating table. Cool.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.501
Huh?

02:16.536 --> 02:18.637
Whoa. I said,
"cool" not "pool."

02:18.672 --> 02:20.138
Haha. Nice!

02:20.173 --> 02:21.339
Evie: What?

02:21.374 --> 02:22.541
He didn't say "ice."

02:22.576 --> 02:23.942
He said "nice"!

02:23.977 --> 02:25.644
Whoa, whoa!

02:25.679 --> 02:26.978
Ugh!

02:27.013 --> 02:28.480
Dalmatians.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.382
If that's the best
we can do,

02:30.417 --> 02:32.651
we're all doomed.
