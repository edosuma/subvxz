OH, THANKS, BUT I'M

00:55.256 --> 00:58.626
I CAN'T DO IT ALL.
I'M JUST ONE GUY.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.330
ONE GUY
WHO DELIVERS CHICKEN.
HERE'S THE NUMBER.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.199
HEY, EMMETT, IF YOU WANT,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET YOU
A JOB TOO.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.235
OH, NO, THANKS, MR. D.
I ALREADY GOT A JOB.

01:07.268 --> 01:11.239

01:11.272 --> 01:13.241

01:16.477 --> 01:18.246

02:09.563 --> 02:12.333
Hey, Charlie, I want to show you
something pretty adorable.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.403
You and Mommy are doing
yoga together.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.340
Okay, Charlie,
this next move

02:19.373 --> 02:21.475
is called The Warrior.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.177
( flatulence )

02:23.211 --> 02:26.314
Charlie.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.417
Mom likes to blame her farts
on other people,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.452
but we love her anyway.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.323
Uh, excuse me,
Mom doesn't fart, no.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.592
She toots.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.762
That was quite a toot
you just cut.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.467
HEY, HONEY,
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.669
GOOD.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.375
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
YOUR HAT LIKE THAT?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.744
OH, NO REASON.
IT'S HOW I ROLL.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.748
OH MY GOSH, GABE,
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.384
CHARLIE AND I
WERE PLAYING PATTYCAKE

03:03.417 --> 03:04.952
AND THINGS WENT BAD.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.455
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

03:07.488 --> 03:10.558
THIS NEW KID IN MY CLASS--
JO SOMETHING.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.627
POOR THING. WHY DO THE BIG KIDS
ALWAYS PICK ON THE LITTLE KIDS?

03:13.661 --> 03:15.763
ISN'T THAT THE ICE PACK
DAD PUTS ON HIS BUTT?

03:15.796 --> 03:18.266
EWW.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.769
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT'S THAT ONE.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.472
EWW.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.607
WHAT ABOUT BROCCOLI?
DAD HATES BROCCOLI.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.276
WHICH IS WHY
HE'D USE IT ON HIS--

03:28.309 --> 03:29.477
EWW!

03:29.510 --> 03:31.579
OH, NO.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.514
IS DAD'S BUTT
ACTING UP AGAIN?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.421
( rings doorbell )

03:40.454 --> 03:43.357
- Woman: WHO IS IT?
- KWIKKI CHIKKI,

03:43.391 --> 03:46.427
WHERE EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN
IS GRILLED WITH LOVE.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.662
HI.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.499
( dramatic music playing )

04:33.474 --> 04:35.309
HELLO?

04:35.343 --> 04:38.579
UH, HERE YOU GO.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.682
THANKS.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.784
KEEP THE CHANGE.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.586
ENJOY YOUR KWIKKI CHIKKI.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.360
I THINK I WAS JUST
GRILLED WITH LOVE.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.838
WOULD YOU MIND ANSWERING
A FEW QUESTIONS

05:04.872 --> 05:06.674
FOR A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
SURVEY?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.609
OKAY.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.478
DID YOU FIND
KWIKKI CHIKKI SERVICE

05:10.511 --> 05:12.446
TO BE GOOD, REALLY GOOD
OR SUPER GOOD?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.582
REALLY GOOD.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.519
IF A GOOD-LOOKING
KWIKKI CHIKKI DELIVERY DUDE
ASKED YOU ON A DATE,

05:18.552 --> 05:21.622
WOULD HIS CHANCES BE GOOD,
REALLY GOOD OR SUPER GOOD?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.525
COULD YOU TAKE OFF
THAT CAP FOR A SECOND?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.398
SUPER GOOD.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.109
FREEZE.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.378
BACK IT UP
AND BRING IT HERE.

05:49.417 --> 05:52.553
OH, GABE, AGAIN?

05:52.586 --> 05:53.821
YES, AGAIN.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.789
WELL, DID YOU AT LEAST
HIT HIM BACK THIS TIME?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.591
I CAN'T DO THAT.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.527
WHY NOT?
YOU GOTTA TAKE
THIS BULLY DOWN,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.662
GIVE HIM A TASTE
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.930
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET HIM TO STOP.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.666
JUST LET ME HANDLE IT.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.601
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:07.635 --> 06:08.936
IF YOU WON'T DO IT,
THEN I WILL.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.505
I WILL SCHOOL THIS KID
TEDDY-STYLE.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
WHOO!

06:13.607 --> 06:16.376
WHOA, I NEED A MANICURE.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.585
HEY, P.J., EMMETT'S CALLED
A FEW TIMES.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.521
YEAH, I'LL CALL HIM LATER.
OH, DAD, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU

06:27.555 --> 06:31.492
MY GIRLFRIEND--
I LOVE SAYING THAT--

06:31.525 --> 06:33.694
SHE TOLD ME
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.430
SHE'S YOUR
GIRLFRIEND ALREADY?
YOU'VE HAD ONE DATE.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.432
ONE AMAZING DATE.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.201
ONE AWESOME,
MAGICAL, FUN--

06:41.234 --> 06:43.704
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

06:43.737 --> 06:46.607
- WHO?
- YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.643
I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU SAY IT TOO.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.712
SHE SAID HER MOM AND YOU
KNOW EACH OTHER.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.647
HER NAME USED TO BE
KATHERINE DAVIS.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.450
KATHERINE DAVIS?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.719
UM...

06:58.752 --> 07:01.188
THAT'S NOT
RINGING A BELL.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.857
BOY, I'D SURE LIKE
TO SEE YOUR REACTION

07:03.891 --> 07:06.627
WHEN SOMEONE DOES
RING A BELL.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.529
WHO IS SHE?

07:08.562 --> 07:13.701
SHE'S THE LAST GIRL
I DATED BEFORE YOU.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.670
I'M DATING YOUR OLD
GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER?

07:16.704 --> 07:18.839
I HOPE THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM FOR ME.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.875
SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE
FOR ME.

07:21.909 --> 07:25.646
I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT HER, BOB.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.916
OH, LOOK, DID I DATE
A LOT OF GIRLS BEFORE YOU?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.751
YES, SURE.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.720
DID I LEAVE A TRAIL
OF BROKEN HEARTS?

07:32.753 --> 07:35.856
ABSOLUTELY.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.759
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS ALL WORTH IT

07:38.792 --> 07:41.662
BECAUSE I SAVED
THE BEST FOR LAST.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.031
OH.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.934
ME TOO.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.804
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET HIM.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.682
( phone rings )

08:01.715 --> 08:03.584
EH.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.656
YOU DID NOT JUST
SEND ME TO VOICEMAIL.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.658
SORRY.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.660
I'M EXPECTING A CALL
FROM MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.895
YOU'VE BEEN DODGING
MY CALLS ALL DAY.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.298
HEY, GOOD NEWS, EMMETT.
WE JUST PUT IN A DOORBELL.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.701
- WHAT WERE YOU CALLING ABOUT?
- TO SEE IF YOU WANTED
TO HANG OUT.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.270
WISH I COULD,
BUT I'M KIND OF
BUSY RIGHT NOW.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.739
( phone rings )

08:25.773 --> 08:29.042
HEY, GIRLFRIEND.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.044
NO, I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.815
YEAH, OF COURSE
I CAN COME OVER.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.651
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT,
MR. D?

08:37.685 --> 08:39.653
WE COULD PLAY
"GUESS THAT SNACK."

08:39.687 --> 08:42.823
I BROUGHT MY BLINDFOLD.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.961

08:52.332 --> 08:54.702

08:54.735 --> 08:58.005
WELL, GIVE THIS

08:59.707 --> 09:02.576
- HEY, GABE.
- HI, JO.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.711
WHERE DO YOU THINK

09:03.744 --> 09:04.978
THAT'S JO?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.715
GOTTA GO.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.950
YOU'RE THE KID WHO'S BEEN
POUNDING MY BROTHER?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.719
BUT YOU'RE A GIRL.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.987
YES, AND THAT'S A CHAIR.
AND THAT'S A BOOK.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.989
ARE WE DONE NOW?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.726
HAVE A SEAT, JO.
YOU AND ME ARE GONNA
HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.629
( clears throat )
OKAY.

09:21.662 --> 09:25.833
JO, I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'M NOT HAPPY.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.002
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHY I'M NOT HAPPY?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.938
NO, BUT I BET
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.807
OH, YES.
I'M NOT HAPPY

09:33.841 --> 09:36.143
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
BULLYING MY BROTHER.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.612
HE'S A BOY,
SO HE CAN'T HIT BACK.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.749
BUT I'M NOT A BOY.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.751
YOU DON'T SCARE ME.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.619
REALLY?
WELL,

09:45.653 --> 09:48.388
DO I SCARE YOU NOW?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.890
NO.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.024
FAIR ENOUGH.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.926
HOW ABOUT NOW?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.902
I CAN DO THAT
WITH PENS.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.172
OKAY, I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE MY BROTHER ALONE,

10:05.205 --> 10:08.876
OR THE NEXT THING

WILL BE YOU.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.911
NOW GET OUT OF MY FACE.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.183
DOES GABE EVER TALK
ABOUT ME?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.185
EVER SINCE YOU GAVE HIM
THAT FAT LIP,

10:18.218 --> 10:20.187
HE'S HAD TROUBLE
TALKING ABOUT ANYONE.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.790
DOES HE HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.825
NO, AND WHY WOULD YOU--?

10:24.858 --> 10:28.061
WAIT A MINUTE.
DO YOU LIKE GABE?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.964
EWW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.703
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.915
OH, SO I HAD A CHAT
WITH YOUR LITTLE FRIEND JO.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.917
- DID SHE PUNCH YOU?
- NO.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.886

10:52.920 --> 10:56.790
OKAY, WELL, GET THIS--
TURNS OUT SHE HAS
A CRUSH ON YOU.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.092
SHE DOES?
WHY DOES SHE KEEP
HITTING ME?

10:59.126 --> 11:02.963
WELL, SHE HAS TROUBLE
EXPRESSING HER FEELINGS

11:02.996 --> 11:04.965
AND THEN SHE GETS FRUSTRATED
AND LASHES OUT.

11:04.998 --> 11:09.002
SO I GET PUNCHED
FOR BEING A HUNK?

11:09.036 --> 11:12.105
YEP, THAT'S IT.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.442
SHE REALLY SAID
SHE LIKES ME?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.044
WHOA, WAIT,
DO YOU LIKE HER TOO?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.679
EWW, THAT'S JUST
DISGUSTING.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.950
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.155

IT'S REALLY FUNNY

12:32.085 --> 12:35.555
'CAUSE I'M THINKING OF A LOT
OF NICKNAMES FOR YOU.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.826
( playing loudly )

12:42.930 --> 12:45.799
- HI, BOYFRIEND.
- HI, GIRLFRIEND.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.067
HI, EMMETT.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.069
GIRLFRIEND.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.872
YOU GUYS ARE REHEARSING.
SHOULD I COME BACK LATER?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.841
- YES.
- NO.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.044
NO, WE'RE JUST
FINISHING UP.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.213
- AREN'T WE?
- WE STARTED FIVE MINUTES AGO.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.115
IT WAS A GOOD
FIVE MINUTES.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.051
I FEEL LIKE
I'M INTRUDING.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.920
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.556
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS.

13:09.589 --> 13:13.961
OKAY, ONE, TWO,
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR--

13:13.994 --> 13:16.830
- NO, EMMETT, STOP.
- WHAT?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.899
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU WERE TALKING
TO MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.101
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
SHE'S INTERRUPTING
OUR REHEARSAL.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.036
SHE HAS NO RESPECT
FOR THE PROCESS.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.572
WE DON'T HAVE
A PROCESS.

13:25.605 --> 13:29.109
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.
- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.845
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU--
YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR THIS BAND?

13:31.879 --> 13:35.015
THIS BAND WAS JUST A WAY
TO GET GIRLS,

13:35.048 --> 13:37.084
WHICH I DID.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.086
FINE.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.254
THEN THIS BAND
IS THROUGH.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.891
I'LL TAKE MY DRUMS
AND GET OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.033
SOMEONE WILL BE BY
TO COLLECT MY THINGS.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.076
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.879
JUST THINKING.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.414
P.J. AND THE VIBE
BROKE UP TODAY.

14:07.447 --> 14:12.152
OH, WELL, SON, IT'S HARD
TO KEEP A BAND TOGETHER.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.621
AND YOU GUYS DID HAVE
SOME CHALLENGES,

14:14.654 --> 14:18.025
MOST OF THEM MUSICAL.

14:18.058 --> 14:22.129
WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER
IF EMMETT WASN'T JEALOUS
OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:22.162 --> 14:26.433
SON, YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME
WITH MADISON.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.269
NOW DID YOU EVER CONSIDER
THAT MAYBE EMMETT
FEELS REJECTED?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.204
BY MY GIRLFRIEND?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.040
BY YOU.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.174
BECAUSE I HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.945
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
IGNORING HIM.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.179
BECAUSE OF
MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.315
P.J., I'M READY
TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.285
SON, YOU CAN'T
LET A GIRL

14:45.318 --> 14:47.454
COME BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.090
BUT MADISON'S SOFTER

14:50.123 --> 14:52.092
AND SMELLS BETTER
THAN EMMETT.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.162
LOOK, TRUST ME
ON THIS, OKAY?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.030
I NEARLY MADE
THE SAME MISTAKE

14:57.064 --> 14:58.966
WHEN I WAS DATING
MADISON'S MOM.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.400
REALLY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.469
KATHERINE WAS
TOO CLINGY,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.304
TOO DEMANDING.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.173
SHE CAME BETWEEN ME
AND MY FRIENDS,

15:06.206 --> 15:08.508
SO I DID
WHAT I HAD TO DO--

15:10.510 --> 15:13.213
LET HER GO,

15:13.246 --> 15:16.416
SAID GOODBYE,

15:16.449 --> 15:19.519
NO MORE BOBBY LOVE
FOR HER.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.224
BOBBY LOVE?
THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLED YOU?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.227
OH, YOU KNOW IT.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.998
UM, THAT ONE WE DON'T NEED
TO SHARE WITH YOUR MOM.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.474
THIS IS WEIRD.
I DON'T USUALLY GET INVITED

15:41.508 --> 15:43.476
TO PLAY DATES
WITH THE KIDS I BEAT UP.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.746
ABOUT THAT--
I TALKED TO GABE

15:46.779 --> 15:49.249
AND TURNS OUT
HE KINDS OF LIKES YOU TOO.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.151
HE DOES?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.252
WHY ARE YOU
CLENCHING YOUR FIST?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.454
I FEEL LIKE
PUNCHING SOMEONE.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.757
OKAY, WELL, WE NEED TO WORK
ON HOW YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF
WITH BOYS.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.093
WHY DON'T WE TRY A LITTLE
ROLE-PLAYING, OKAY?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.095
- I'LL BE GABE.
YOU'LL BE YOU.
- OKAY.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.098
SO LET'S PRETEND
WE RUN INTO EACH OTHER
AT SCHOOL.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.034
- HI, JO.
- HI, GABE.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.336
I LIKE YOUR JACKET.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.472
( grunts )

16:12.505 --> 16:16.409
WELL, SOMEBODY
KNOWS KARATE.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.212
SORRY.
IT WAS A REFLEX.

16:19.246 --> 16:22.349
- LET ME TRY AGAIN.
- OKAY, BUT THIS TIME

16:22.382 --> 16:24.351
LET'S KEEP OUR HANDS
TO OURSELVES, OKAY?

16:24.384 --> 16:26.219
GOT IT.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.221
OKAY.
HI, JO.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.289
HI, GABE.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.324
WANT TO SIT WITH ME
AT LUNCH?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.194
YAH!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.331
I SEE YOU FOUND
A LOOPHOLE.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.433
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE FEET.

16:40.467 --> 16:44.171
AND NOW YOU'VE LEARNED
THE WORD "LOOPHOLE."

16:44.204 --> 16:48.241
NOW TRY THIS TIME

16:48.275 --> 16:51.278
WITH NO HANDS
AND NO FEET

16:51.311 --> 16:53.213
OR ANYTHING ELSE
YOU COULD HIT ME WITH.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.082
GOT IT.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.283
HI, JO.
YOU LOOK NICE.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.255
VERY GOOD, JO.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.491
YOU CLENCHED YOUR FIST
AND THEN YOU UNCLENCHED.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.226
THAT IS CALLED PROGRESS.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.129
FEELS WEIRD
WITHOUT HITTING,

17:09.162 --> 17:11.798
- BUT I KIND OF LIKE IT.
- ( door opens )

17:11.831 --> 17:14.334
WHAT IS SHE
DOING HERE?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.270
NO NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.272
- RIGHT, JO?
- RIGHT.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.374
HEY, GABE.
YOU LOOK NICE.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.444
WHAT?

17:24.477 --> 17:27.480
SHE GAVE YOU A COMPLIMENT.
SAY SOMETHING NICE BACK.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.583
UH...

17:30.617 --> 17:35.088
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SOFTER
THAN YOUR FISTS?

17:35.122 --> 17:38.225
THANKS.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.227
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
HANG OUT FOR A WHILE?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.229
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS
TRYING TO DECIDE

17:42.262 --> 17:45.265
IF I SHOULD APPLY
ICE OR HEAT.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.302
SO WHAT DO YOU
LIKE TO DO?

17:49.336 --> 17:51.538
I LIKE
MONSTER TRUCKS,

17:51.571 --> 17:54.374
MIXED MARTIAL ARTS
AND DOLLS.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.410
- YOU LIKE VIDEO GAMES?
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.512
- "GALAXY OF DEATH."
- IS IT VIOLENT?

17:59.546 --> 18:02.415
LEVEL TWO COMES WITH
THE BARF BAGS.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.385
IT'S REALLY FUN.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
YOU HAD ME
AT BARF BAG.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.330
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:17.364 --> 18:19.332
I'M BETWEEN DELIVERIES,

18:19.366 --> 18:21.368
BUT I REALLY WANTED
TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.

18:21.401 --> 18:25.338
FIRST, I'M LIKE
TOTALLY PSYCHED
THAT YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.674
GREAT.
ANYTHING ELSE?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.577
WELL, YEAH.
I WAS JUST THINKING

18:30.610 --> 18:33.513
THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING
A LITTLE LESS TIME TOGETHER,

18:33.546 --> 18:35.515
YOU KNOW, SO WE STILL
HAVE TIME FOR FRIENDS.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.417
WORKS FOR ME.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.553
NOT STARTING RIGHT NOW.
MADISON, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.422
- NOTHING.
- Man: GOTTA GET
TO WORK, BABE.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.558
- WHO'S THAT?
- NOBODY.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.560
SEE YOU LATER, BABE.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.296
NICE HAT.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.398
THANKS.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.601
YOU TOO.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.236
WHO WAS THAT?

18:56.269 --> 18:58.538
JUST THE PIZZA DELIVERY GUY.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.574
REALLY? DON'T THEY
USUALLY DELIVER PIZZAS

19:01.608 --> 19:03.443
TO YOUR HOUSE,
NOT FROM YOUR HOUSE?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.711
I DON'T--

19:04.744 --> 19:07.214
AND DON'T THEY USUALLY
NOT KISS THE CUSTOMERS

19:07.247 --> 19:09.382
AND CALL THEM "BABE"?

19:09.416 --> 19:11.418
YOU WERE CHEATING ON ME
WITH PIZZA PIRATE.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.620
NO, ACTUALLY I WAS CHEATING
ON PIZZA PIRATE

19:13.653 --> 19:16.289
WITH KWIKKI CHIKKI.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.326
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE THROUGH.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.328
ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

19:21.361 --> 19:25.198
UNLESS YOU PROMISE
NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.200
YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY BREAK UP.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.402
HE GAVE ME A WHOLE BUNCH
OF COUPONS.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.517
GET OFF ME!
HELP! OW!

19:44.551 --> 19:46.719
JO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.356
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.758
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME
LIKING GABE.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.361
THIS IS ABOUT HIM CHEATING
AT "GALAXY OF DEATH."

19:54.394 --> 19:56.229
I DIDN'T CHEAT.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.398
GET THIS WHACKO
OFF ME!

19:58.431 --> 20:01.601
COME ON, JO,
GET OFF HIM.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.503
LET GO.
LET GO.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.406
WHOA!

20:07.740 --> 20:09.409
( squeals )

20:09.442 --> 20:11.444
YOU WANT
SOME OF THIS?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.522
Hey, Charlie.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.526
Well, today was a bad day
for the Duncan kids.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.331
We learned that sometimes
love hurts.

20:31.364 --> 20:36.269
No kidding.
Jo dislocated my shoulder.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.472
Madison dislocated
my heart.

20:39.506 --> 20:43.543
Well, maybe love gets easier
as we get older.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.046
Honey, it's no Kitty-Kat,
but at least it's a nickname.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.549
Amy-potomus?

20:49.582 --> 20:52.452
Well, when you say it
like that...

20:54.387 --> 20:56.689
Or maybe love never
gets easier.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.559
Then again,
to figure that out.e

20:59.592 --> 21:01.494
Good luck with that,
Charlie.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.831
( doorbell rings )

21:11.738 --> 21:14.507
- HI.
- HEARD ABOUT YOUR BREAKUP.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.775
WHO TOLD YOU?

21:15.808 --> 21:17.844
I SAW YOU CHANGE
YOUR ONLINE STATUS

21:17.877 --> 21:22.449
FROM "IN A RELATIONSHIP"
TO "DUMPED."

21:22.482 --> 21:25.518
BRING IT HERE.

21:25.552 --> 21:29.322
IT HURTS SO MUCH.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.691
I KNOW.
EMMETT'S HERE.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.494
LET IT OUT.

21:34.527 --> 21:38.465
AND IGNORE
MY LAST VOICEMAIL.

21:38.498 --> 21:42.402
- WHAT?
- NO NO NO NO.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.745
HEY, GABE.
NICE BACKPACK.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.481
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JO?

21:54.514 --> 21:57.484
I THINK I WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
I WANT YOUR BACKPACK.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.751
NO.

21:58.785 --> 22:02.755
I'M SORRY,
DID YOU JUST SAY NO?

22:02.789 --> 22:04.824
YOU HEARD ME.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.360
YOU'RE NOT BULLYING ME
ANYMORE.

22:07.394 --> 22:10.129
WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA SIC
YOUR SISTER ON ME AGAIN?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.764
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HER.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.501
I HAVE MORE
THAN ONE SISTER.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.945
AND THAT'S AFTER ONLY ONE
KARATE LESSON.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.918
( squeals )

22:31.951 --> 22:33.786
( kick thuds )
