<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

00:03.619 --> 00:07.569
All dead. As is your grandson.

00:07.715 --> 00:11.872
I think Brock may have been poisoned
with something called ricin.

00:12.008 --> 00:15.381
Shut up!
Why did you poison him?

00:15.479 --> 00:19.168
Who do you know? Gus allowed
children to be murdered. Gus!

00:19.376 --> 00:21.235
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Then let me help.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.963
Don't go! Don't go!
No! No!

01:34.811 --> 01:36.278
What did you say to Gus?

01:36.313 --> 01:38.347
Because he's on to us.
Yeah.

01:38.381 --> 01:40.016
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?

01:40.050 --> 01:43.019
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.

01:43.053 --> 01:45.255
What, does he have
some kind of sixth sense?

01:45.290 --> 01:46.958
Jesus, what did you say to him?

01:46.992 --> 01:50.695
Could I ask my own question
right now, at this point?

01:50.730 --> 01:53.232
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

01:53.266 --> 01:56.703
What? Was I supposed
to leave it on his car?

01:56.737 --> 01:58.738
What, you're supposed
to bring it into a hospital?

01:58.772 --> 02:01.641
Oh, my God.

02:01.675 --> 02:06.546
Look. Where can we find Gus?
Name a place.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.514
Name me one place
where I could surprise him,

02:08.549 --> 02:09.882
where he won't see me coming.

02:11.385 --> 02:15.154
Because his house, the laundry,

02:15.188 --> 02:16.989
the restaurant,
the factory farm,

02:17.023 --> 02:18.457
they're all wired with cameras.

02:18.492 --> 02:20.893
One place.

02:20.927 --> 02:22.328
Think.

02:22.362 --> 02:23.563
Jesse, think.

02:23.597 --> 02:25.799
Where is it?
Where?

02:25.833 --> 02:28.468
Because if you can't tell me,

02:28.503 --> 02:30.704
we are dead.

02:40.082 --> 02:42.484
Jesse.

02:42.518 --> 02:44.286
I don't-- I don't know.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.588
Well, maybe--

02:46.622 --> 02:49.157
Excuse me.
Jesse Pinkman?

02:49.192 --> 02:50.358
Uh, yeah.

02:50.393 --> 02:52.327
Hi.
Detective Kalanchoe.

02:52.361 --> 02:54.963
This is Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

02:54.997 --> 02:57.532
We were wondering if we could
have a few minutes of your time,

02:57.567 --> 02:59.000
maybe go someplace and talk.

02:59.035 --> 03:00.301
About what?

03:00.336 --> 03:01.870
Sorry, sir,
I didn't catch your name.

03:01.904 --> 03:03.038
About what?

03:03.072 --> 03:04.941
It concerns Brock Cantillo

03:04.975 --> 03:07.543
and a statement
you made to his mother.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.212
How about you come with us?

03:09.247 --> 03:11.581
We just want to clear
a few things up. No big deal.

Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

03:49.223 --> 03:50.890
Am I under arrest?

03:50.925 --> 03:53.360
No, you're not under arrest.

03:53.394 --> 03:54.661
We're just talking.

03:54.696 --> 03:56.463
So if I get tired of talking,

03:56.498 --> 03:57.731
want to get up and leave--

03:57.766 --> 03:59.166
We'd prefer you didn't.

04:00.535 --> 04:02.436
You'd prefer, so--

04:02.470 --> 04:03.970
Jesse, why did you
tell Brock's mom

04:04.005 --> 04:07.040
that the boy had been poisoned?

04:07.074 --> 04:12.111
Look, I think this has been,
you know,

04:12.145 --> 04:13.746
uh, what do you call it?

04:13.780 --> 04:17.016
Overblown, because
all I basically said was

04:17.050 --> 04:21.087
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

04:21.120 --> 04:23.256
You know, in a cover-all-bases
kind of sense.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.959
Yeah. No, I'm sure
they appreciated that,

04:25.993 --> 04:27.594
you helping them out like that,

04:27.628 --> 04:29.663
especially with how specific
you were and all.

04:29.697 --> 04:31.699
Ricin. Wow.

04:31.733 --> 04:34.135
Yeah, ricin--
that's definitely a big one.

04:34.169 --> 04:35.437
You don't see that every day,

04:35.471 --> 04:36.938
so when doctors,
they hear that,

04:36.973 --> 04:38.974
they take it very seriously,

04:39.009 --> 04:40.944
as do we,

04:40.978 --> 04:42.712
as does the FBI.

04:42.746 --> 04:44.180
Okay.

04:44.214 --> 04:46.817
And nice, you trying to
help out like that and all,

04:46.851 --> 04:48.952
you know,
professional courtesy,

04:48.986 --> 04:51.121
sharing your expertise.

04:51.155 --> 04:54.258
I ain't go no expertise.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.826
All right?
I just, you know--

04:55.861 --> 04:58.228
You just happen to guess
this one rare poison

04:58.263 --> 05:00.998
might be the thing that put this
little boy in the hospital.

05:01.033 --> 05:03.434
And congratulations,
because his doctors,

05:03.468 --> 05:06.070
they're beginning to think
that you might just be right.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.771
So why ricin?

05:07.806 --> 05:09.040
Jesse, how did you come up
with that?

05:09.074 --> 05:11.842
Man, I think I've--

05:11.877 --> 05:14.612
I don't know. I must've saw it
on <i>House</i> or something.

05:14.646 --> 05:15.680
Huh.

05:15.714 --> 05:16.748
Yeah, you know, like <i>House</i>

05:16.782 --> 05:19.083
or the Discovery Channel.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.986
Sometimes your brain just
makes these connections.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.988
- Does it?
- Mine does.

05:24.022 --> 05:25.923
That's interesting.

05:25.957 --> 05:28.626
Look, I've got to get back.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.327
But we're still talking.

05:32.698 --> 05:34.732
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

05:36.602 --> 05:42.239
So, then, I guess I should
call my lawyer. Right?

05:42.274 --> 05:45.475
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.378
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

05:48.412 --> 05:50.814
Man, you know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

05:50.849 --> 05:53.483
Suddenly everything's
a big pissing match,

05:53.518 --> 05:54.718
like, every time.

05:54.753 --> 05:56.020
Adversarial.

05:56.054 --> 05:58.455
Adversarial. Then we gotta
book you, blah, blah. Right?

05:58.489 --> 06:00.958
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.694
You're no boy scout.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.598
Saul Goodman.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.768
That's my guy.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.604
So do I gotta call him,
or do you?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.111
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.612
I need Saul.
I need him right now.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.081
So you break into the place.
You just break in! Jesus!

06:56.116 --> 06:57.449
You're here, by the way.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.585
If you'd had bothered answering
the phone or the door,

06:59.619 --> 07:01.854
maybe I wouldn't have--
Forget it.

07:01.888 --> 07:02.855
Is he here?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.089
Is that a serious question?

07:04.123 --> 07:05.791
Why would he be here?

07:05.825 --> 07:07.226
You know where he is,
don't you?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.360
I need a number.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.897
Look. Let me explain
something to you.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.865
- My partner and I--
- Are in danger?

07:13.899 --> 07:15.466
Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.767
Why do you think he's not here?

07:16.802 --> 07:18.703
And how's that news, exactly,

07:18.737 --> 07:20.838
the two of you being in danger,

07:20.872 --> 07:22.673
after doing something idiotic?

07:22.707 --> 07:25.509
And what gives you the right
to break down my door?

07:25.544 --> 07:28.312
Look, I just need a number.
Okay? That's all.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.448
You are such a pain in my ass.

07:30.482 --> 07:32.049
You know that?

07:32.084 --> 07:33.351
You're the reason
I've got to go on unemployment

07:33.385 --> 07:35.152
for God knows how long.

07:35.187 --> 07:36.320
I was at least looking forward

07:36.355 --> 07:37.955
to getting out of here
in the next half hour,

07:37.990 --> 07:38.990
but no!

07:39.024 --> 07:40.791
Now I've got to wait
around all day

07:40.826 --> 07:42.859
for a plate glass guy
to come and fix this door,

07:42.894 --> 07:43.994
and who pays for this?

07:44.028 --> 07:46.429
Okay, you know what?

07:46.463 --> 07:48.231
Here, look.
I'm giving you everything,

07:48.265 --> 07:49.699
all of it, okay?

07:49.733 --> 07:51.533
There's one, two, three--

07:51.568 --> 07:55.103
Look, there's got to be
at least $1,700 there, okay?

07:55.138 --> 07:56.638
That will more than cover
the cost of the door.

07:56.672 --> 07:58.473
Now, I apologize profusely.

07:58.507 --> 08:00.442
Please, the phone number.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.981
Door like this is going to
cost way more than 1,700.

08:06.015 --> 08:08.384
What? For a plate of glass?
No.

08:08.418 --> 08:10.787
Oh, yeah, I bet it does.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.689
I bet you
it winds up costing...

08:14.592 --> 08:16.326
20,000.

08:18.496 --> 08:19.930
Are you insane?

08:19.964 --> 08:22.165
Who the hell is going
to charge $20,000

08:22.199 --> 08:24.200
for a plate glass door?

08:24.234 --> 08:26.735
There's no
reputable vendor w--

08:33.476 --> 08:35.275
Now I'm thinking 25.

08:43.183 --> 08:44.684
I'll be right back.

09:52.288 --> 09:54.122
Yes, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

09:55.424 --> 09:57.592
The number of Rebecca Simmons,

09:57.626 --> 10:00.462
306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

10:00.496 --> 10:03.065
Would you connect it
for me, please?

10:03.099 --> 10:04.533
Thank you.

10:08.605 --> 10:11.808
Becky, hi, it's Walter White.

10:11.843 --> 10:13.710
Listen, I wa--

10:13.745 --> 10:15.212
I'm-I'm-- I'm fine.

10:15.246 --> 10:16.380
I'm fine. How are you?

10:17.582 --> 10:19.817
Oh, good, good.

10:19.851 --> 10:22.219
Yes, cats are--

10:22.254 --> 10:25.322
Listen, Skyler and I
are out of town.

10:25.357 --> 10:26.857
We're on our way up
to Santa Fe,

10:26.891 --> 10:28.925
and Junior just told us

10:28.960 --> 10:32.595
that he thinks he may
have left the burner on,

10:32.630 --> 10:33.863
on the stove.

10:33.897 --> 10:36.499
Yes, God forbid there's a fire.

10:38.101 --> 10:39.969
Well, that's--
that's why I'm calling.

10:40.003 --> 10:41.771
I just wanted to ask,

10:41.805 --> 10:43.807
and I'm sorry to do this,

10:43.841 --> 10:45.575
but do you still have the key?

10:45.609 --> 10:46.743
You do?

10:46.777 --> 10:48.678
Good. And would you be
willing to--

10:49.680 --> 10:52.015
Oh, you are a life saver.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.684
Thank you so much.

10:53.718 --> 10:57.722
Yes. Okay. Okay,
I'll await your call.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.558
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

11:15.643 --> 11:17.110
There you go.

12:42.899 --> 12:44.099
Becky?

12:45.969 --> 12:49.138
Oh. Oh, that's good.

12:49.172 --> 12:50.939
That's a relief.

12:50.974 --> 12:53.942
I owe you one, big time.

14:02.478 --> 14:03.845
So how's he doing?

14:06.581 --> 14:07.915
Yo, you could at least say,

14:07.949 --> 14:10.717
instead of being
a couple of dicks about it.

14:11.886 --> 14:14.921
Jesse, if you cared at all
about that little boy,

14:14.955 --> 14:17.290
prove it to me.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.125
Tell us what you know.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.326
I told you what I know.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.527
Tell us again.

14:21.561 --> 14:25.999
What are you, like--
like broken records?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.501
I was trying to be helpful.

14:28.536 --> 14:31.772
End of story.

14:31.806 --> 14:33.741
Guess we'll have to wait and
see what the tox screen says.

14:38.647 --> 14:40.148
Oh, look at this.
Isn't this cozy?

14:40.182 --> 14:41.383
What did you tell them?

14:41.417 --> 14:43.284
I told them they were
a couple of dicks.

14:43.319 --> 14:45.286
He's a wordsmith.

14:45.321 --> 14:46.921
Well, Detectives,

14:46.955 --> 14:47.922
it's been a pleasure.

14:47.956 --> 14:48.922
Now, up you go.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.257
Make like you've got manners.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.226
Make like you respect
the rule of law.

14:53.261 --> 14:55.628
<i>Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,</i>

14:55.662 --> 14:58.530
<i>hasta luego,</i> get the hell out.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.131
Buh-bye.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.099
That's it. Pick it up.
Follow your partner.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.368
And one, two...

15:04.402 --> 15:06.103
Thank you.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.306
Christ. You two.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.408
All I can say is
if I ever get anal polyps,

15:10.442 --> 15:12.109
I'll know what to name them.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.412
You gonna get me out of here?

15:14.446 --> 15:17.249
Ah. Hm. No.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.384
Not even if I could.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.921
You know, the FBI's going to
show up on this ricin thing,

15:22.955 --> 15:25.289
and then you're in it
for the duration.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.261
You know,
you're a lot safer in here.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.930
They just tried to get
your partner in his own home.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.199
Jesus.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.600
Is he okay?

15:35.635 --> 15:39.437
Well, he's okay
like a fruit fly's okay.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.072
We're all on the clock here,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.507
and thanks for that,
by the way.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.810
You two want to stick
your wangs in a hornet's nest,

15:44.844 --> 15:46.345
it's a free country,

15:46.379 --> 15:50.082
but how come I always gotta
get sloppy seconds, huh?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.584
Have you got anything for me?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.487
I mean, tell me I didn't
poke my head up for nothing.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.525
Yeah.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.728
I've been thinking.

16:00.762 --> 16:01.795
And?

16:04.165 --> 16:05.566
Casa Tranquila.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.067
What's Casa Tranquila?

16:07.101 --> 16:09.603
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

16:09.637 --> 16:11.605
Our boy tells me
Fring took him there

16:11.639 --> 16:13.106
to visit one of the patients,

16:13.140 --> 16:16.042
someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember--

16:16.076 --> 16:17.443
Tio Salamanca.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.080
Old guy in a wheelchair.

16:23.517 --> 16:25.785
Um, doesn't talk,

16:25.820 --> 16:27.621
rings a bell.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.656
I don't mean
"Does that ring a bell?"

16:29.691 --> 16:31.359
I mean, the guy actually
has to ring a bell.

16:31.393 --> 16:33.761
I-- Yes, I know.
I remember.

16:35.831 --> 16:38.266
So what, once every blue moon,

16:38.301 --> 16:42.305
Gus goes and visits
an old cartel associate.

16:42.339 --> 16:45.241
That-- That doesn't help me.

16:45.275 --> 16:46.743
I can't very well hide out

16:46.777 --> 16:48.210
in a nursing home
for six months,

16:48.244 --> 16:50.112
hoping, on the off chance,

16:50.147 --> 16:52.815
that he comes back.

16:52.849 --> 16:55.318
It's not even like
they're friends.

16:55.352 --> 16:58.587
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

16:58.622 --> 16:59.955
What does that mean?

17:01.892 --> 17:03.959
He told him the last
of his family was dead.

17:03.994 --> 17:05.728
He seemed to enjoy telling him.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.463
Afterward, Pinkman
asked him about it.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.598
All Gus would say
was that this Tio character

17:09.632 --> 17:12.201
once murdered
someone close to him.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.137
Wait. Tio murdered
someone close to Gus?

17:16.173 --> 17:19.442
I know it sound
not particularly fruitful,

17:19.476 --> 17:23.112
but, sorry, that's all I got.

17:25.015 --> 17:26.982
They're enemies,

17:27.016 --> 17:28.217
not friends.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.421
Your next
number in this coverall game,

17:32.455 --> 17:34.456
where you cover
the whole shmoley,

17:34.491 --> 17:37.026
is B number 3

17:37.060 --> 17:39.428
like <i>Goldilocks</i>
<i>and the Three Bears.</i>

17:39.462 --> 17:43.098
That's number 3
in your B column,

17:43.132 --> 17:47.402
followed by O-74.

17:47.436 --> 17:51.873
That's O-74 on the other
side of your card.

17:55.378 --> 17:59.515
Now we have that lucky number--
B number 7.

17:59.549 --> 18:03.953
Is it lucky for you?
B-7.

18:03.987 --> 18:06.823
In the "I" row, 2-1.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.795
I know you despise me,

18:11.830 --> 18:15.600
and I know how badly
you want to see me dead,

18:15.634 --> 18:17.335
but I'm willing to bet

18:17.370 --> 18:19.872
that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

18:19.906 --> 18:21.807
Those Ns just keep coming.

18:21.841 --> 18:23.642
They're all sticking together.

18:25.111 --> 18:27.513
I am offering you
an opportunity

18:27.547 --> 18:28.614
for revenge.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.683
Column 4-8,

18:30.717 --> 18:32.418
the continental United States,

18:32.452 --> 18:34.920
excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

18:53.170 --> 18:56.172
Okay, I'm here.

18:56.207 --> 18:58.141
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca?

18:58.176 --> 18:59.776
You need something?

18:59.810 --> 19:02.278
You need to go poopie?
Huh?

19:02.313 --> 19:04.547
Did you go poopie already?
No?

19:04.582 --> 19:06.650
What do you need?

19:06.684 --> 19:08.752
Want me to get
the board for you?

19:08.787 --> 19:10.220
Okay.

19:11.856 --> 19:13.023
All right.

19:15.026 --> 19:17.961
Okay, here we go.

19:20.698 --> 19:23.100
A-E-I--

19:23.134 --> 19:24.401
Row I.

19:24.435 --> 19:28.771
I-J-K-L-M-N--

19:28.806 --> 19:31.274
First letter-- N.

19:31.308 --> 19:32.842
A-E--

19:32.877 --> 19:33.944
Row E.

19:33.978 --> 19:35.212
E--

19:35.246 --> 19:37.480
Second letter-- E.

19:37.515 --> 19:39.082
A-E--

19:39.116 --> 19:40.249
Row E.

19:40.284 --> 19:41.417
E--

19:41.452 --> 19:43.586
Next letter-- E.

19:43.620 --> 19:44.820
A--

19:44.855 --> 19:48.524
Row A.
A-B-C-D--

19:49.727 --> 19:51.461
Next letter-- D.

19:51.495 --> 19:52.629
A--

19:52.663 --> 19:53.830
Row A.

19:53.865 --> 19:57.267
A-B-C-D--

19:57.302 --> 19:59.169
Next letter-- D.

19:59.204 --> 20:00.704
A-E--

20:00.738 --> 20:02.039
Row E.

20:02.073 --> 20:03.607
E--

20:03.641 --> 20:04.741
E.

20:04.776 --> 20:05.943
A--

20:05.977 --> 20:07.378
Row A. A--

20:08.480 --> 20:09.513
Next letter-- A.

20:09.547 --> 20:13.417
A-E-I-O-U...

20:15.787 --> 20:17.622
I don't think we're finished,
Mr. Salamanca.

20:17.656 --> 20:22.960
A-E-I-O-U...

20:22.995 --> 20:24.762
Finish the word,
Mr. Salamanca.

20:26.097 --> 20:28.165
Is it "dear"?

20:29.501 --> 20:32.103
Is it "deal"?

20:34.940 --> 20:37.641
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.

20:37.675 --> 20:39.009
Help me out here.

21:07.069 --> 21:08.269
Hey, son, what's up?

21:08.304 --> 21:10.939
When exactly
are you getting here?

21:10.974 --> 21:13.676
<i>Uh, just as soon as I can.</i>

21:13.710 --> 21:15.611
Look, this is
a serious situation,

21:15.645 --> 21:17.446
and it's like you're not
taking it seriously.

21:17.481 --> 21:18.815
Give me the phone.
Let me talk to him.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.450
<i>No, son, I am
taking it</i> <i>very seriously.</i>

21:20.484 --> 21:22.319
Just-- Just give it to me,
Walt.

21:22.353 --> 21:25.056
<i>I'm very concerned</i> <i>about your
Uncle Hank</i> <i>and his safety,</i>

21:25.090 --> 21:29.193
but whomever is making
these threats against him,

21:29.227 --> 21:32.396
I can assure you there's
no interest in me.

21:32.431 --> 21:34.832
I'm not on--
on anyone's radar,

21:34.866 --> 21:36.467
<i>- and besides your mother and I.</i>
- Give it to me.

21:36.501 --> 21:37.701
Walter?

21:37.736 --> 21:39.169
Did you hear what he said?

21:39.204 --> 21:40.504
Get over here.

21:40.539 --> 21:42.039
<i>No more excuses.</i>

21:42.074 --> 21:44.941
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

21:44.976 --> 21:46.243
- I promise.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

21:47.679 --> 21:49.079
You want to weigh in here?

21:49.113 --> 21:50.914
Maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

21:50.949 --> 21:54.084
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here, so just...

21:57.388 --> 21:59.589
Well, I hope you sell
plenty of air fresheners.

21:59.623 --> 22:02.258
<i>I hope you just have</i>
<i>a banner day over there.</i>

22:02.292 --> 22:03.493
<i>Okay, Walt?</i>

22:03.527 --> 22:04.894
<i>Don't worry</i> <i>about a thing here.</i>

22:04.928 --> 22:07.063
Goodbye.

22:07.097 --> 22:08.798
And thank you

22:08.832 --> 22:11.367
for all of your help.

22:11.402 --> 22:12.668
Huh?

22:20.810 --> 22:22.544
Anything?

22:39.261 --> 22:41.463
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Steve.

22:41.497 --> 22:42.564
How's everybody holding up?

22:42.598 --> 22:44.499
Hey, Gomie,
just the man I want to see.

22:44.534 --> 22:45.667
Come here, look at this.

22:47.403 --> 22:49.070
Jesus, enough with the laundry.

22:49.104 --> 22:50.772
No, no, no, hear me out.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.907
This panel,
if I'm reading it correctly,

22:52.942 --> 22:55.143
is a 7,200-amp service.

22:55.177 --> 22:56.277
This place has two of them.

22:56.311 --> 22:57.411
All right?

22:57.446 --> 22:59.480
That's a whole lot of juice,
brother.

22:59.515 --> 23:02.383
Laundry this size typically
has maybe half that, okay?

23:02.418 --> 23:04.118
So what's with the extra panel?

23:04.153 --> 23:05.619
What are you,
Thomas Edison now?

23:05.654 --> 23:07.355
No, I asked
a bunch of electricians.

23:07.389 --> 23:08.689
They have their own chat rooms,

23:08.723 --> 23:11.125
you know, like where all
they talk about was wiring?

23:11.159 --> 23:14.329
Freakin' Internet-- find
anything on it these days.

23:14.363 --> 23:15.663
What do you say?

23:15.698 --> 23:17.666
Pop over,
have another look-see?

23:19.770 --> 23:21.037
Listen.

23:22.773 --> 23:25.141
I think we possibly have
a lead on something.

23:25.175 --> 23:26.375
Yeah?

23:26.410 --> 23:28.177
I have this guy
down at the office.

23:28.212 --> 23:30.380
He says he has
some kind of information.

23:30.414 --> 23:33.015
The thing is,
he'll only give it to you,

23:33.050 --> 23:34.818
in person.

23:40.825 --> 23:42.058
Okay.

23:42.093 --> 23:43.560
Remember Hector Salamanca?

23:43.594 --> 23:44.828
Sh-- Yeah.

23:44.862 --> 23:46.863
What, you mean the old
cripple guy with the bell?

23:46.898 --> 23:48.599
Rather crap on our floor
than talk to us?

23:48.633 --> 23:50.200
No, I don't remember him
at all. Why?

23:50.235 --> 23:52.803
Well, he's the guy.

23:52.837 --> 23:54.004
His nurse calls us,

23:54.039 --> 23:56.774
says he wants to powwow.

23:56.809 --> 23:58.409
So we have this guy
at the office

23:58.444 --> 23:59.844
for three hours,

23:59.879 --> 24:02.481
and he still just wants
to talk to you.

24:02.515 --> 24:06.486
Do not even think
about going down there.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.654
Marie.

24:07.688 --> 24:08.921
This is clearly a ploy

24:08.956 --> 24:10.223
or a trick or something

24:10.257 --> 24:12.792
designed to get Hank
out into the open.

24:12.826 --> 24:13.893
That's all this is.

24:13.927 --> 24:15.161
That's what we thought.

24:15.195 --> 24:16.529
Well.

24:16.564 --> 24:19.065
It's been years since
this guy's been a player.

24:19.099 --> 24:20.466
His nephew's gone.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.768
Doesn't have anybody.

24:21.802 --> 24:24.070
The nurse checks out--
doesn't know nothing.

24:24.105 --> 24:27.307
Guess I just don't see
an angle in it,

24:27.341 --> 24:29.275
if there even is one.

24:29.309 --> 24:32.578
Of course, if you did want
to talk to this guy,

24:32.612 --> 24:34.313
there's not safer place
than the office.

24:35.448 --> 24:37.782
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

24:37.817 --> 24:39.117
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.

24:39.151 --> 24:41.486
It is a ridiculous idea,

24:41.520 --> 24:43.888
and there is no way
you are going to do it,

24:43.923 --> 24:45.223
end of story.

24:47.259 --> 24:49.594
Hank, thanks for coming down.

24:49.629 --> 24:52.297
No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.

25:02.310 --> 25:05.379
So Mr. Salamanca.

25:05.413 --> 25:06.747
You had something
you want to tell me?

25:15.190 --> 25:18.425
A-E-I-O--

25:19.694 --> 25:22.162
Row O.

25:25.099 --> 25:26.633
First letter-- S.

25:26.667 --> 25:31.171
A-E-I-O-U--

25:32.540 --> 25:33.873
Second letter-- U.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.609
A--

25:35.643 --> 25:37.611
B-C--

25:39.814 --> 25:42.015
A-E-I--

25:43.384 --> 25:44.384
J-K--

25:45.553 --> 25:48.622
A-E-I--

25:50.058 --> 25:53.027
J-K-L-M--

25:54.863 --> 25:59.700
A-E-I-O-U--

25:59.735 --> 26:01.135
Row U.

26:01.169 --> 26:04.472
V-W-X-Y--

26:04.506 --> 26:06.574
All right, that's enough.

26:09.144 --> 26:11.146
Thank you.

26:11.180 --> 26:13.582
Yeah, thanks.
I can spell.

26:14.785 --> 26:19.155
Well, you got that
out of your system now?

26:19.190 --> 26:21.091
Shall we try this
one more time?

26:29.533 --> 26:31.534
F--

26:31.568 --> 26:36.038
A-E-I-O-U--

26:39.876 --> 26:41.843
A--

26:41.877 --> 26:42.944
B-C--

26:44.246 --> 26:46.914
Yeah, we-- we got it.

26:46.949 --> 26:49.784
I am-- I am--
I am just so, so sorry.

26:59.195 --> 27:01.062
Well, at least this time
he didn't shit himself.

27:03.499 --> 27:04.833
Guess that's progress.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.430
<i>Yes.</i>

27:34.465 --> 27:36.299
We may have a problem.

27:36.333 --> 27:37.800
I've got eyes on the DEA.

27:37.835 --> 27:40.519
<i>They just had</i>
<i>a visitor--</i>

27:41.671 --> 27:44.019
<i>Hector Salamanca.</i>

27:53.946 --> 27:55.880
I don't even know
what to say to you right now.

27:55.914 --> 27:57.281
You just sit here,

27:57.316 --> 27:58.449
and you think about how far

27:58.483 --> 28:00.552
that kind of behavior
is going to get you.

28:00.586 --> 28:02.286
Not far, let me tell you.

28:16.435 --> 28:17.736
Any second thoughts?

28:20.673 --> 28:22.840
Then let's get to work.

30:51.295 --> 30:55.765
Hello!

30:57.435 --> 30:59.735
Shh.

31:34.371 --> 31:35.704
Mr. Pinkman...

31:36.907 --> 31:38.140
you're free to go.

31:38.175 --> 31:40.242
Why?

31:40.276 --> 31:41.543
What happened?

31:41.578 --> 31:43.078
Tox screen came back.

31:43.112 --> 31:45.580
No ricin poisoning.

31:47.516 --> 31:49.151
Surprised, huh?

31:51.487 --> 31:53.355
No, why should I be?

31:53.389 --> 31:55.124
Your jacket.

31:59.162 --> 32:00.629
Till we meet again.

32:07.703 --> 32:08.870
Hey, yo!

32:08.904 --> 32:11.638
Yo! Right here.

32:16.110 --> 32:20.279
Hey, Andrea,
I'm just checking on Brock.

32:20.314 --> 32:24.317
Uh, hey, it sounds like--

32:24.352 --> 32:27.821
I mean, listen, just call me
if you can, all right?

32:27.855 --> 32:28.989
I'm headed back over.

32:30.224 --> 32:31.424
Hey, excuse me.

32:49.310 --> 32:50.544
Yes.

32:50.578 --> 32:52.380
<i>We just picked up Pinkman.</i>

32:52.414 --> 32:53.815
<i>No witnesses.</i>

32:56.385 --> 32:57.819
What about Hector?

32:57.853 --> 33:00.888
I've checked inside and out.

33:00.922 --> 33:03.023
No wires, no camera,

33:03.057 --> 33:04.925
no surveillance.

33:04.959 --> 33:07.127
A police cruiser rolled
through about an hour ago.

33:07.161 --> 33:08.394
Seemed routine.

33:08.429 --> 33:10.763
<i>It's just him,</i>
<i>alone in his room.</i>

33:15.368 --> 33:16.468
All right.

33:18.503 --> 33:19.904
I'm on my way.

33:20.972 --> 33:22.673
Maybe it's better if--

33:22.707 --> 33:24.808
if I do this myself.

33:25.844 --> 33:27.244
I do this.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.652
It's all clear.

35:17.925 --> 35:19.325
Wait here.

36:29.899 --> 36:32.167
What kind of man
talks to the DEA?

36:34.570 --> 36:36.204
No man.

36:37.540 --> 36:38.806
No man at all.

37:19.887 --> 37:22.255
A crippled little <i>rata.</i>

37:22.290 --> 37:24.624
What a reputation
to leave behind.

37:39.106 --> 37:40.773
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

37:46.713 --> 37:48.447
Last chance to look
at me, Hector.

38:17.178 --> 38:18.278
Aah!

38:29.024 --> 38:30.191
Oh, my God.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.892
Oh, Jesus.

38:31.927 --> 38:33.694
Oh, Jesus.

38:48.277 --> 38:49.977
<i>The same vote for sure.</i>

38:50.012 --> 38:51.546
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>
<i>It's that time again,</i>

38:51.580 --> 38:53.681
<i>where we tell you</i> <i>about your
own</i> <i>personal slice of hell</i>

38:53.716 --> 38:55.550
<i>known as the Albuquerque</i>
<i>afternoon commute.</i>

38:55.584 --> 38:57.085
<i>How bad are things</i>
<i>looking out there?</i>

38:57.119 --> 38:58.720
<i>I'll tell you what.
</i> <i>Right now southbound 25</i>

38:58.754 --> 39:00.155
<i>has got an accident there</i>
<i>at Jefferson</i>

39:00.189 --> 39:01.390
<i>on the right shoulder,</i>

39:01.424 --> 39:02.791
<i>so make sure you stay</i>
<i>to the left</i>

39:02.825 --> 39:04.360
<i>as you move</i> <i>through that area,</i>

39:04.394 --> 39:06.429
<i>and things have slowed</i>
<i>to a crawl at the Big I,</i>

39:06.463 --> 39:07.696
<i>no surprises there, either.</i>

39:07.731 --> 39:08.931
<i>All right, hang on.</i>

39:08.965 --> 39:10.099
<i>I hate</i> <i>to interrupt you here,</i>

39:10.133 --> 39:11.567
<i>but I do have some breaking</i>
<i>news here,</i>

39:11.601 --> 39:13.235
<i>now coming</i> <i>out of the North
Valley,</i> <i>apparently.</i>

39:13.270 --> 39:15.804
<i>An explosion has been</i>
<i>reported at a nursing home,</i>

39:15.839 --> 39:17.573
<i>the Casa Tranquila</i>
<i>Nursing Home.</i>

39:17.608 --> 39:19.175
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- You heard of that place.</i>

39:19.209 --> 39:22.377
<i>We've got very few details</i>
<i>on it so far,</i> <i>unfortunately.</i>

39:22.412 --> 39:23.712
<i>The initial report is,</i> <i>though,</i>

39:23.746 --> 39:25.948
<i>that as many as three people</i>
<i>may have been killed.</i>

39:25.982 --> 39:27.282
<i>Oh, no.</i>

39:27.316 --> 39:28.717
<i>Now, the news is disturbing.</i>

39:28.751 --> 39:30.085
<i>We're going to get you</i>
<i>more information on this</i>

39:30.119 --> 39:31.853
<i>just as soon as it comes in.</i>

39:31.888 --> 39:33.955
<i>Situation over there,</i>
<i>I imagine, is pretty hectic.</i>

39:33.989 --> 39:35.323
<i>What's traffic looking like?</i>

39:35.357 --> 39:36.658
<i>Yeah, I know where</i>
<i>the nursing home is.</i>

39:36.692 --> 39:38.259
<i>If you're moving</i>
<i>through that area,</i>

39:38.294 --> 39:40.428
<i>we're going to be talking</i>
<i>about east and westbound Paseo</i>

39:40.462 --> 39:42.063
<i>in that area there</i>
<i>in the North Valley.</i>

39:42.097 --> 39:44.532
<i>Please, you've got to avoid</i>
<i>that area as you move through.</i>

39:44.566 --> 39:47.168
<i>Our hearts going out</i> <i>to the
victims</i> <i>of this tragedy.</i>

39:47.202 --> 39:49.604
<i>We'll bring you more details</i>
<i>just as soon as we get them.</i>

39:49.638 --> 39:53.107
<i>Coming up on Coyote 102.5--</i>
<i>Aerosmith, Def Leppard.</i>

39:53.141 --> 39:55.776
<i>Keep it right here</i>
<i>on New Mexico's finest rock.</i>

40:30.475 --> 40:32.242
You wanna cook
with a broken arm?

40:35.046 --> 40:37.414
Next step, CO2.

40:37.448 --> 40:38.848
Do it.

40:56.834 --> 40:58.968
Hey.

40:59.003 --> 41:00.537
I better hear them click.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.299
What, you got a problem
with stairs?

41:37.911 --> 41:39.212
Please, please...

42:06.543 --> 42:08.310
Gus is dead.

42:13.349 --> 42:15.216
We've got work to do.

44:13.035 --> 44:14.702
<i>Vámonos.</i>

45:01.920 --> 45:05.089
Uh, he's going to pull through.

45:05.124 --> 45:07.692
Yeah?

45:07.726 --> 45:11.495
Yeah, it looked
kind of touch-and-go there

45:11.530 --> 45:13.598
for a while, but he's gonna--

45:15.200 --> 45:16.700
he's gonna make it.

45:18.169 --> 45:19.869
Thank God.

45:21.038 --> 45:22.739
Oh, thank God.

45:30.213 --> 45:34.283
You know, still saying
it wasn't the ricin.

45:37.487 --> 45:39.254
I don't understand.

45:39.289 --> 45:41.223
Then what was it?

45:41.257 --> 45:43.058
Saying it was most likely

45:43.092 --> 45:46.228
a flower called
lily of the valley.

45:47.863 --> 45:50.265
Yeah, it's--
it's, like, common.

45:50.299 --> 45:52.600
It's got these
red berries on it

45:52.635 --> 45:54.068
that I guess taste sweet,

45:54.103 --> 45:55.503
and sometimes
little kids eat them

45:55.537 --> 45:56.837
and wind up poisoning
themselves,

45:56.872 --> 45:58.706
and that's it,

45:58.740 --> 46:00.641
nothing more.

46:04.411 --> 46:08.281
So Gus didn't poison him
after all.

46:13.655 --> 46:15.423
Still, he--

46:17.159 --> 46:20.395
he had to go, right?

46:23.333 --> 46:25.401
You're damn right.

46:25.435 --> 46:26.768
Gus had to go.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.944
Um, you know, I should--

46:38.246 --> 46:39.813
I should get back.

46:39.848 --> 46:41.181
Andrea's waiting.

47:28.768 --> 47:32.071
<i>I'm here at Casa Tranquila,</i> <i>where three
people are dead</i> <i>following an explosion</i>

47:32.105 --> 47:35.374
<i>that rocked this elderly care</i>
<i>facility earlier today.</i>

47:36.844 --> 47:38.845
<i>The fireball completely</i>
<i>consumed one resident's room</i>

47:38.880 --> 47:40.047
<i>and damaged common areas</i>
<i>nearby.</i>

47:40.081 --> 47:41.348
Walt?

47:41.382 --> 47:42.716
- Tell Dad to turn on his TV.
- Shh.

47:42.751 --> 47:43.884
Walt, let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

47:43.919 --> 47:45.953
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Shh.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.388
Walt?

47:47.423 --> 47:48.556
<i>How are you doing?</i>

47:48.590 --> 47:50.658
How am I doing?
How are you doing?

47:50.692 --> 47:52.593
I'm, uh...

47:55.196 --> 47:56.797
I'm doing quite well.

47:58.132 --> 48:01.001
I'm good.

48:01.035 --> 48:03.770
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

48:03.804 --> 48:05.305
Gus Fring is dead.

48:05.339 --> 48:07.440
<i>He was blown up along</i>
<i>with some person</i>

48:07.474 --> 48:09.743
<i>from some Mexican cartel,</i>

48:09.777 --> 48:12.346
<i>and the DEA has no idea</i>
<i>what to make of it.</i>

48:13.849 --> 48:15.482
Do you know about this?

48:15.517 --> 48:18.252
<i>Walt?</i> <i>I need you to--</i>

48:18.287 --> 48:20.088
It's over.

48:20.122 --> 48:21.489
We're safe.

48:35.471 --> 48:36.971
Was this you?

48:39.908 --> 48:41.575
<i>What happened?</i>

48:43.411 --> 48:45.111
I won.
