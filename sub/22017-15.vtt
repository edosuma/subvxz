09:25.940 --> 09:28.480

team for my artists?

09:28.510 --> 09:30.720

09:30.920 --> 09:32.910
- I hear you.
- Do you?

09:32.950 --> 09:35.760
I know you been cutting me out
calls and meetings, Natalie.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.620
How much is this
costing, anyway?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.950
25K.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.120
25 who?

09:42.160 --> 09:43.860
Out of whose budget? Not mine.

09:43.890 --> 09:45.190
Midtown's.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.330
At no cost to the artists.

09:47.930 --> 09:49.320
And, uh, I've got to take this.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.020
Look, I know you need this
business thing with her to work,

09:56.060 --> 09:57.246

running game on me.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.440
Relax.

09:58.470 --> 09:59.480

10:04.080 --> 10:06.510

you owning that stage.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.920
Mom, what are you doing here?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.919
I had your father's
assistant call to tell you

10:36.920 --> 10:38.080
that I'd be joining you.

10:38.110 --> 10:40.900

thing was a charade.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.640

Noah are for real now.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.360
Well, I'm here to see you.

10:50.390 --> 10:51.479

10:51.480 --> 10:53.299
I need to see what's
going on with Carlotta.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.260
Give you ladies some
time to catch up.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.600

You haven't learned anything

11:09.460 --> 11:11.540

your father, have you?

11:11.580 --> 11:13.580
Don't do that.
You're projecting.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.050
They're not the same.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.750

11:20.160 --> 11:21.800
Mom, what's the matter?

11:24.120 --> 11:26.840

tape with your father.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.630
Sent me a private copy.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.200
Threatened to go to the press.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.700
I'm done.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.700

forward against my father?

want to relive it.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.160
You snitched on me
to my father, Jahil.

11:58.190 --> 11:59.830
Was it worth it?

11:59.860 --> 12:02.230
No. It wasn't.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.400
No. 'Cause now his head's

What? No. Not like that.

23:35.260 --> 23:38.840
I just... I don't know. I
overheard you talking to Ayanna.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.910
Charles Floyd.

23:42.540 --> 23:45.820
I used to look up
to him and, uh...

23:45.850 --> 23:48.420
I don't know, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

23:48.450 --> 23:49.850
I-I didn't know that it was...

23:49.890 --> 23:51.990
I know all about you, Jahil.

23:52.020 --> 23:54.390
Why do you care? Huh?

23:54.430 --> 23:56.200
You get off on it or something?

23:58.600 --> 23:59.900
I'm sorry.

23:59.930 --> 24:03.220
Uh... never mind.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.570
I was 18

24:07.680 --> 24:10.420
when he first called
me to his office.

24:13.340 --> 24:16.950
There's a part of me that
keeps asking myself...

24:16.980 --> 24:19.940
"Why didn't you say anything
when he touched you?

24:22.460 --> 24:25.280
Why did you sign the
contract afterwards?"

24:25.340 --> 24:26.880
You were young.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.960
And Charles preyed on that.

24:33.630 --> 24:36.730
When I came to that
Midtown launch party,

24:36.770 --> 24:39.540
it was to spit in his face.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.140
Then I saw a woman was in charge

24:43.180 --> 24:45.980
and all the talent that's here.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.140
If I speak out...

24:49.300 --> 24:50.920
you lose all that.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.950
This is bigger than the label.

24:53.990 --> 24:56.840
It's time to stop being afraid.

25:08.470 --> 25:10.770
You know you can't be out here.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.900
Look, I'm sorry about what Andy said.
That was messed up.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.580
But we need to talk.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.180
You know, I-I was thinking
about going to that ball

25:20.210 --> 25:22.960
that Miss Bruce is
really excited about.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.480
Do you want to go?

25:24.520 --> 25:27.020
Simone, I'm not
going to no ball.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.320
What's going on with you?

25:30.360 --> 25:33.020
I...

25:33.060 --> 25:34.279
I don't know.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.410
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:35.420 --> 25:36.576
- Hey, hey, come on, hey.
- No, no, no, no, stop.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.620
<i>- Hey, come on.
- Stop.</i>

25:37.640 --> 25:39.100
Hey, stop!

25:41.320 --> 25:43.020
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

25:43.780 --> 25:45.000
You don't get it, Angel.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.650
Because you won't talk to me!

25:46.670 --> 25:48.940
What is going on here?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.640
You been drinking, young man?
Look at me.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.080
No, sir.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.200
Ma'am, are you okay?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.760
- I'm-I'm fine.
- Let me see some ID.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.600
Come on.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.190
Rivera.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.990
I'm gonna run a background check.
Wait here.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.470
All right, ma'am. I need
you to sit right there.

26:07.490 --> 26:09.080
- I...
- Sit down.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.420
This really isn't necessary.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.120
Come here.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.839
- All right.
- Okay.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.350
I'll sit you down, right
here on this curb, okay?

26:20.370 --> 26:22.110
Yeah, no problem.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.960
Here we go.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.040
No moving. Stay right here.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.530
If you're orchestrating
things in your favor, then...

26:32.550 --> 26:34.180
Maurice, you know what it is.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.436
I position your artists so
that Sound House takes notice

26:36.460 --> 26:38.590
and I get a little something
extra along the way.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.660
Kickbacks from a
private security team?

26:40.780 --> 26:42.490
Maurice, don't act surprised.

26:42.530 --> 26:44.240
Look, I know what we agreed to.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.930
Now, I'm trying to do the best
for my artists long-term.

26:46.970 --> 26:49.316
- I don't want Carlotta hurt.
- Before I came along,

26:49.340 --> 26:51.199
they were playing second-rate
clubs in Atlanta.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.240
Now look.

26:52.270 --> 26:53.500
Yeah, I know.

26:53.540 --> 26:55.870
So, then don't come
for me like this

26:55.910 --> 26:58.980
when I can think of
so many better ways.

27:20.350 --> 27:21.520
You're good to go.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.890
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.860
All right, listen. Come
here, both of you.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.740
If you guys are gonna get in
big fights like that again,

27:30.760 --> 27:32.640
you keep it out of the streets.
You understand?

27:35.570 --> 27:38.080
Adios, Rivera.

27:42.710 --> 27:43.810
Angel.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.540
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.950
If they were working for ICE,

27:46.980 --> 27:48.920
I'd be put in the
back of a cop car

27:48.940 --> 27:49.956
and you'd never see me again.

27:49.980 --> 27:51.439
Look, I didn't mean for things

27:51.440 --> 27:53.120
to get out of hand like that.

27:53.150 --> 27:54.650
Angel, please. You
don't unders...

27:54.690 --> 27:56.290
I'm not playing games
with you, okay?

27:57.180 --> 27:59.560
If you don't want to be
with me, then just say it.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.720
All right.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.300
You go, boy.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.910
- That was a bold move. Yeah...
- Oh, Roland.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.680
Oh, my God. Is
that the sex tape?

28:21.720 --> 28:24.580
I want to see what was worth
destroying my marriage.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.140
Noah, I've got to go.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.890
Look, what we're not
about to do is this.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.260
That's sick, Mom.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.436
What's sick is that that boy

28:33.460 --> 28:35.240
snuck out of this hotel
without telling you.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.530
That's because I'm
babysitting your ass.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.660
He is already lying,
just like your father.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.060
God, you and Dad
are so messed up.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.080
You messed me up.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.420
Stop expecting me to fail at
everything just because you did.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.080
I did fail and I gave up my life

28:51.110 --> 28:53.880
for a man that disrespected
me over and over.

28:53.910 --> 28:55.810
Mom, I'm not you.

28:55.850 --> 28:58.480
No, you're not.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.040
You're my beautiful,
strong girl.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.560
I'll never be as strong as you.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.630
I'm not drinking anymore,

29:10.660 --> 29:13.420
but I'm still addicted
to your father.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.520
- Get up. We're going out.
- We're on lockdown.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.680
Have you ever been
to a ball before?

29:26.710 --> 29:28.080
What kind of ball?

29:31.180 --> 29:32.620
Let's go.

29:32.650 --> 29:35.090
I know we got some time to kill.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.520
I got a bootleg
of <i> Black Panther.</i>

29:38.790 --> 29:40.560
- Of course you do.
- Let's watch it.

29:40.590 --> 29:42.460
Everybody is over at
Miss Bruce's ball.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.060
Yeah, I'm definitely
not going to that.

29:49.070 --> 29:51.200
What up?

29:54.380 --> 29:56.640
- Any word on the lockdown?
- Nah.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.590
Yeah, but I heard you performed
at that gay bar, though.

29:58.610 --> 30:00.310
Oh, you still want to go at it?
What's up?

30:00.350 --> 30:01.460
Okay, y'all have
to dead this now.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.096
It's not cool that we're all
on tour with each other

30:03.120 --> 30:04.650
and that you guys
keep having beef.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.760
Fix it.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.220
I shouldn't have said that
about your father, bro.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.260
I crossed the line.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.090
How is this even still a thing?

30:13.130 --> 30:15.730
Why do we call people gay
like it's a bad thing?

30:15.760 --> 30:17.760
Why you acting like
it's such a mystery?

30:18.330 --> 30:19.500
It's been like that.

30:19.530 --> 30:20.970
Well, it ain't got
to be like that.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.319

politically correct,

Mom, you've got to chill.

stay out later with the girls.

34:45.900 --> 34:49.469
Um, you know, Miss Carlotta
says she got a call

34:49.500 --> 34:51.300
from sponsors tonight.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.540
They heard my
performance is back on.

34:53.570 --> 34:54.770
Mmm.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.739
Oh, darling...

34:56.780 --> 34:57.980
Mrs. Crane.

34:58.010 --> 34:59.410
Oh, hey, wait a minute, Mrs.
Crane.

34:59.450 --> 35:02.610
Where do you think my
daughter learned it from?

35:02.650 --> 35:03.750
Mm.

35:04.780 --> 35:07.020
Whoa, Mrs. Crane.

35:07.750 --> 35:10.960
Oh, Alex, it's not
what you think.

35:10.990 --> 35:12.180
It's not what you think.

35:12.190 --> 35:13.520
Yeah, I know.

35:14.060 --> 35:15.880
This is just what she does.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.860
No good.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.319
Put your clothes on, Mom.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.100
I'm so sorry, darling.

35:21.130 --> 35:23.840
I'm going to get
sober in a minute.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.640
- Now!
- I'm no good.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.360
Mom, you need to get out.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.250
Get out!

35:41.020 --> 35:42.450
Oh.

35:55.150 --> 35:56.650
Hey.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.780
Are you okay?

36:03.500 --> 36:05.360
Old man Floyd.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.030
You ever had any
run-ins with him?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.040
Not with him.

36:17.380 --> 36:20.250
Ayanna wants me to
tell my story, but...

36:22.240 --> 36:24.840
I don't want people looking
at me like I'm a victim.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.990
GiGi can't go out like that.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.540
Well, GiGi could
talk about it...

36:44.570 --> 36:47.140
and let girls know
that they ain't alone.

36:51.580 --> 36:53.750
'Cause that's what
it feels like.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.260
It feels like
you're the only one

37:01.190 --> 37:02.990
and it's somehow your fault,

37:03.020 --> 37:05.160
- but it ain't.
- But it ain't.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.760
Time's up, bitch.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.920
To be honest, I really don't
know if I'm doing this right.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.940
I feel like you are
doing it right.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.060
We're gonna find out.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.400
I like being home.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.580
Hmm.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.260
You talk to your mom?

37:46.160 --> 37:48.400
I can't right now.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.570
Come here.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.180
Hey, y'all.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.350
- Hey.
- Hey, Miss C.

38:00.380 --> 38:01.710
The sponsor called.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.580
So, they're ready
to make an offer?

38:03.620 --> 38:06.350
Well, actually they
did, but not to you.

38:06.390 --> 38:08.590
Somebody else caught their eye.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.420
You, at the ball.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.590
It went viral.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.800
- What?
- That's awesome. What?

38:16.830 --> 38:19.030
- But what about Noah?
- What about Noah?

38:19.070 --> 38:21.260
This is amazing. You-you
have to take it.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.400
- Okay.
- All right.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.120
I'll call Principal Sportswear,
let 'em know you're in.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.610
- You want to eavesdrop?
- Yeah.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.880
Okay.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.750
All right. All right.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.550
Are you sure?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.450
Yes. Yes, I'm very sure.

38:40.350 --> 38:41.940
Okay.

38:42.790 --> 38:45.390
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.120
Look at you.

39:14.540 --> 39:16.100
That's a lot of new stuff.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.060
Yeah. Bo say

39:18.090 --> 39:19.920
he can hook us up
with some free cable.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.330
My lawyer said my
settlement check came,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.300
like, two weeks ago.

39:24.330 --> 39:26.230
I was just...

39:26.270 --> 39:28.900
trying to spruce the place
up a bit around here.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.020
With my money?

39:32.210 --> 39:35.840
I took you in, raised you,

39:35.880 --> 39:38.540
washed your dirty, crippled ass,

39:38.580 --> 39:41.380
let your hoochie mama
move in my house,

39:41.410 --> 39:44.520
and you call it your money?

39:45.540 --> 39:48.580
Look like the cripple ain't
so crippled no more, huh?

39:51.640 --> 39:52.840
I got to move out.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.330
You can have the money.
Come on, dear.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.639
Come on. Come on, you can stay.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.240
I can't!

40:04.000 --> 40:06.040
And you and I both know that.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.680
I guess I have

40:15.700 --> 40:19.460
a bit of a trust issue.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.590
Why don't you give me that music
you wanted Maurice to hear?

40:27.630 --> 40:29.230
I'm not gonna throw

40:29.240 --> 40:32.100
a listening party or anything,
but I'll pass it on.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.730
Are you gonna listen to it?

40:33.770 --> 40:35.430
Mm-mm. I can't.

40:35.470 --> 40:36.670
Why?

40:36.700 --> 40:39.299
The sex is too good.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.880
What if the music sucks?

40:46.050 --> 40:49.840
That New Orleans gig
wore a brother out.

40:50.050 --> 40:52.020
The girls were fire, though.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.420
They were.

40:55.390 --> 40:57.590
I've been thinking
about Natalie,

40:57.620 --> 41:00.020
how she been hooking us all up.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.630
You know, bigger gigs,
private security.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.730
She keeps her clients happy.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.500
She keeps herself happy.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.070
You're something else, man.

41:13.110 --> 41:15.640
Carlotta, what are
you talking about?

41:15.700 --> 41:18.440
Just once I want somebody
to take care of me.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.510
I had Ayanna check into

41:21.550 --> 41:24.350
this expensive security firm,
and guess who owns it.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.290
Your girl is getting kickbacks.

41:29.190 --> 41:30.760
And I bet you're wondering

41:30.790 --> 41:34.360
why I'm coming for
you like this...

41:34.390 --> 41:38.260
when you can think of
so many other ways.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.500
Carlotta...

41:49.310 --> 41:51.060
Keep that bitch.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.620
What if he never wants
to be in my life?

42:02.820 --> 42:04.290
Listen, I got a long list

42:04.320 --> 42:05.820
of people who have
written me off,

42:05.860 --> 42:08.130
and you used to be on it.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.360
Right? But, hey, I kept trying.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.330
And look where we are now.

42:14.370 --> 42:16.420
Hmm?

42:16.500 --> 42:19.600
You got to try, Arnold.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.410
That's so not funny.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.310
Gramps.

42:26.350 --> 42:27.600
Hey.

42:32.340 --> 42:33.680
Hey.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.490
You can't be my dad.

42:42.530 --> 42:44.900
All of my friends
will laugh at me.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.830
I know you had a certain
picture in your mind

42:49.870 --> 42:51.740
of what a dad would be.

42:54.170 --> 42:56.800
But maybe we can make
a different picture.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.510
I'm gonna tell my mom

43:00.550 --> 43:03.650
that I don't want to
come here anymore.

43:09.460 --> 43:10.890
Jayden?

43:10.920 --> 43:12.320
- Jayden?
- Jayden, what's hap...?

43:12.360 --> 43:13.720
Hey. Jayden, can you hear me?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.230
Call 911. Go.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.040
Hey, listen. Get 911 now!

43:20.140 --> 43:22.499
All right, take it easy, all
right, it's gonna be all right.
