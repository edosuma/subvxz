WEBVTT

00:48.362 --> 00:50.487
You need new pillows.

00:50.493 --> 00:53.037
My pillows rule,
and you know it.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.551
You know, we could stay
at your place tonight.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.236
Maybe.

01:19.406 --> 01:21.202
We'll see how the day goes.

01:25.229 --> 01:27.528
<i>Sigalert on the northbound 405
at the 10</i>

01:27.530 --> 01:29.274
<i>due to an overturned semi.</i>

01:29.342 --> 01:31.779
<i>It spilled over a hundred
cases of diapers</i>

01:31.789 --> 01:33.709
<i>all across the lanes of traffic.</i>

01:36.798 --> 01:39.064
- Somebody's tense.
- Sure.

01:40.026 --> 01:42.815
Keep going.
I'll get over it.

01:43.284 --> 01:45.496
You've been working too hard.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.050
This coming from a girl
who works four double shifts

01:49.056 --> 01:50.824
in five days ?

01:50.836 --> 01:52.541
Hey, life of nurse.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.995
Life of a cop.

01:57.147 --> 01:58.247
Hey...

01:58.262 --> 02:00.040
let's just take a drive
up the coast...

02:00.111 --> 02:02.110
Blow off the world for a day.

02:04.234 --> 02:06.936
I got a meeting with
internal affairs at 3 :00.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.832
- This is about Andrea ?
- Yeah.

02:09.931 --> 02:11.442
How serious is it ?

02:11.552 --> 02:13.006
Serious enough.

02:13.539 --> 02:15.958
I'd hate to lose another partner
just'cause...

02:16.519 --> 02:19.086
somebody's got
a personal ax to grind.

02:20.529 --> 02:22.864
You think Chad has something
to do with it ?

02:44.543 --> 02:46.206
Ah, no.

02:50.249 --> 02:51.367
Listen...

02:51.382 --> 02:52.892
your business
is your business,

02:52.905 --> 02:55.519
and me bringing up my ex-husband
in the shower just...

02:55.964 --> 02:58.656
that wasn't right, so...
I'll never do it again.

03:00.194 --> 03:02.580
I didn't mean to break your...
your palm tree thing.

03:02.948 --> 03:04.879
My mom gave it to me.

03:06.601 --> 03:07.547
I'm sorry.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.139
Where can I- where can I get you
a new one ?

03:09.144 --> 03:11.651
This cute little place
in Palm Springs.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.771
I think it's called
a gas station.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.425
Listen...

03:21.370 --> 03:23.600
I know things
haven't been exactly-

03:23.615 --> 03:25.115
No, everything's...

03:25.293 --> 03:27.531
all good, all right ?
I'll call you at the hospital ?

03:29.897 --> 03:31.687
- All right.
- Be safe.

03:31.864 --> 03:33.592
Give Rambis a hug for me.

03:33.754 --> 03:34.889
Okay.

03:52.137 --> 03:53.752
I've got a dozen e-mails
to return,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.777
a conference call that starts,
like, now.

03:55.799 --> 03:57.923
And the note says...

03:58.007 --> 03:58.884
What ?

03:59.722 --> 04:01.817
You want me
in Burbank by 8 :00 ?

04:02.544 --> 04:04.725
That's in 20 minutes.
I'm in Venice.

04:04.739 --> 04:05.770
Oh, gosh.

04:08.326 --> 04:09.377
Crap.

04:15.452 --> 04:17.539
Oh, it's okay, ma'am.
I'm a cop.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.060
Thank you, officer.

04:24.005 --> 04:25.132
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.972
- yeah, there's a traffic jam on the 405.
- Miss.

04:27.985 --> 04:29.861
- I don't know some diapers or some...
- Excuse me, miss.

04:29.877 --> 04:31.269
You dropped this.

04:43.063 --> 04:45.415
- Somebody call 9-1-1.
- Oh, my God !

04:45.709 --> 04:46.911
Are you okay ?

04:47.176 --> 04:48.524
My car !

04:48.893 --> 04:50.271
My car !

05:04.563 --> 05:05.777
Mr. Harper,

05:05.915 --> 05:08.760
your dog bark
very hard last night.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.590
Oh, sorry about that,
Mr. Zeitoun.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.797
You have a leak
from upstairs.

05:16.035 --> 05:17.853
My wife say plumbers come.

05:17.856 --> 05:19.059
- Now we have leak.
- Okay.

05:19.075 --> 05:20.825
- Thank you.
- You have leak. We have leak.

05:32.597 --> 05:33.770
Rambis ?

05:36.558 --> 05:37.666
Rambis.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.788
Rambis.
Psycho dog,

05:56.801 --> 05:58.363
did you make this mess ?

06:06.442 --> 06:08.786
All right, all right,
I get it. Give me this.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.987
<i>You have nine messages.</i>

06:13.500 --> 06:14.638
<i>Message one.</i>

06:15.590 --> 06:16.927
<i>Message two.</i>

06:23.991 --> 06:25.004
Hello.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.545
Sis, I got six hang ups from you
last night. What's goin'on ?

06:28.133 --> 06:30.201
Nothing. We just...
we just had a little,

06:30.703 --> 06:32.713
problem with the phone.
But it's okay now.

06:32.939 --> 06:34.441
You sure ?
You sound kinda rattled ?

06:34.445 --> 06:35.870
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

06:35.875 --> 06:37.577
<i>it's... we're just late for school.</i>

06:37.592 --> 06:39.975
So we'll talk later, okay ?
Bye.

06:48.025 --> 06:49.221
<i>Message seven.</i>

06:50.776 --> 06:52.874
<i>Damn it, where you at ?
It's me, Damien.</i>

06:52.889 --> 06:54.292
<i>Turn on your cell phone.</i>

06:54.296 --> 06:55.875
<i>They hit the safe house, Hop.</i>

06:55.898 --> 06:57.593
<i>You need to come get my ass.</i>

06:57.970 --> 06:59.520
Police !
Hands up !

06:59.534 --> 07:01.312
Easy ! Easy !
I'm a cop.

07:01.328 --> 07:02.638
I'm a cop !

07:02.649 --> 07:05.138
Okay, all right.
Okay, I'm relaxed.

07:05.143 --> 07:07.307
- I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
- Detective brett hopper ?

07:07.321 --> 07:09.281
Yeah. Get these guys
off of me.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.247
Can't. You're under arrest for
the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto garza.

07:12.251 --> 07:14.482
- What ?
- "You have the right to remain silent.

07:14.495 --> 07:16.993
"If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say can

07:20.280 --> 07:20.910
+

07:30.983 --> 07:32.761
- Have a seat.
- Before y'all apologize

07:32.775 --> 07:34.633
for breaking down my door,

07:34.635 --> 07:35.791
I want to see the warrant.

07:35.796 --> 07:38.144
'Cause you had to have more
than some lame-ass anonymous tip

07:38.158 --> 07:40.589
to get a judge to sign off
on that kind of a blitz.

07:41.246 --> 07:43.090
Well, they told us
you'd puff up.

07:43.538 --> 07:45.020
I'm Detective Choi.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.347
- Detective Spivak.
- I've had the pleasure.

07:47.372 --> 07:50.084
Look, you know what we do in here,
all the tactics, the back and forth,

07:51.115 --> 07:52.737
so I'm coming straight at you.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.046
What did you have against Garza ?

07:57.828 --> 07:59.451
You gotta be kidding, right ?

07:59.456 --> 08:01.982
We've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

08:04.510 --> 08:06.627
All right, well, a gun's
easy enough to plant.

08:06.909 --> 08:09.368
Prints are doable, too,
a little tougher. Where'd you get it ?

08:09.375 --> 08:10.837
Where do you think we got it ?

08:10.868 --> 08:13.340
I don't know, but chances are,
whoever gave you the gun

08:13.344 --> 08:15.143
is in on it.
Now tell me where you got it.

08:15.155 --> 08:16.272
Your place.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.492
Your closet.

08:17.668 --> 08:18.728
The closet ?

08:21.696 --> 08:23.514
Pretty stupid move, man.

08:23.529 --> 08:25.460
Why would you hang on
to something like that ?

08:26.052 --> 08:28.358
Somebody broke into my place
and put that gun there.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.678
Now the neighbor said something
about a plumber,

08:30.683 --> 08:33.335
- and my dog was going crazy, so-
- Why'd you do it, Hopper ?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.895
Was it personal, or did Garza
have something on you ?

08:36.044 --> 08:38.150
All right, you guys aren't...

08:39.563 --> 08:41.363
According to the newspapers,
Garza was hit

08:41.378 --> 08:42.984
sometime last night, right ?

08:42.988 --> 08:45.390
Well, I was with somebody
last night. Rita Shelton.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.242
She's a nurse at Westside.

08:47.257 --> 08:48.996
So I got an alibi.
Secondly,

08:49.011 --> 08:50.807
I've never even met Garza, so...

08:50.824 --> 08:53.310
- you got no motive.
- How about murder-for-hire ?

08:59.196 --> 09:01.551
I want my lawyer and a phone.

09:01.565 --> 09:04.284
After you're booked,
like everyone else.

09:05.783 --> 09:07.938
Look into the camera, please.

09:09.926 --> 09:11.860
Thank you very much.
You can step away.

09:14.532 --> 09:15.819
Andrea...

09:16.687 --> 09:18.774
Hang on.
That's my partner.

09:21.138 --> 09:23.839
- Hopper, what's goin'on ?
- I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.

09:24.043 --> 09:26.245
I've got to get to my brother !

09:28.341 --> 09:30.013
They put me on leave.

09:30.198 --> 09:31.798
So before you go telling certain
people things

09:31.806 --> 09:34.939
- you think-
- Andrea, hello ? Fingerprints, mug shot.

09:35.073 --> 09:36.873
I'm a little busy right now.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.569
Let's go, detective.

09:40.222 --> 09:43.067
You are a lucky man, Hopper. I got you
one of the best criminal defense attorneys

09:43.083 --> 09:45.848
in the state. Barry Colburn. He'll meet you
at the courts'building for arraignment.

09:45.864 --> 09:47.920
Come on, Baxter.
You gotta do better than that.

09:47.945 --> 09:49.962
Now flex some federal muscle
and get me outta here.

09:49.969 --> 09:52.208
I'm doing the best I can. Been on the phone
all morning. Nobody's giving an inch

09:52.221 --> 09:53.884
not the D.A.'S office, not L.A.P.D.

09:53.899 --> 09:56.636
I'm a cop with a clean record
and an alibi.

09:56.650 --> 09:58.586
<i>- How is this happening ?
- Hey, I know you're pissed.</i>

09:58.599 --> 10:00.618
But this hurts me, too.
Damien is on the run,

10:00.630 --> 10:03.263
and you're the only one he trusts.
This case hinges on his testimony.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.182
Well, I'm sorry for being
so insensitive.

10:05.197 --> 10:07.675
Seriously, Hopper. How am I supposed
to find my star witness without you ?

10:07.690 --> 10:08.971
Did you see Damien last night ?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.973
<i>Did you talk to him ?
Give me something.</i>

10:13.358 --> 10:15.992
All right, he left a message on my machine.
He wants me to come get him.

10:15.995 --> 10:18.101
Where is he ?
What happened at the safe house ?

10:18.114 --> 10:20.642
Focus, Baxter.
I'm the one in jail.

10:20.656 --> 10:23.395
Now I can't help you or Damien
unless you get me outta here.

10:32.512 --> 10:35.133
- Let's go.
- Why did you kill Garza ?

10:35.136 --> 10:37.570
Why did you kill Garza,
detective Hopper ?

10:37.575 --> 10:40.178
Detective Hopper, this way !
Was it murder-for-hire ?

10:47.444 --> 10:49.412
Baxter tried to put in
a good word for you

10:49.427 --> 10:50.946
with the L.A. County D.A.,

10:50.953 --> 10:53.587
- But Garza was one of theirs.
- All right, Colburn-

10:53.637 --> 10:55.724
- Barry.
- Where's Rita ?

10:56.986 --> 10:58.620
We can't find her.

10:58.894 --> 11:00.738
What do you mean, you can't find her.
did you check the hospital ?

11:00.755 --> 11:02.984
She's not at the hospital,
she's not in her apartment,

11:02.999 --> 11:05.419
she's not answering her cell.
The cops are looking for her,

11:05.435 --> 11:07.298
- and I've got my people out in the street.
- Colburn,

11:07.314 --> 11:10.309
your first and last priority
as of right now

11:10.490 --> 11:13.044
Rita Shelton.
Do you understand me ?

11:14.709 --> 11:15.798
Okay.

11:18.661 --> 11:19.940
Oh, by the way,

11:19.953 --> 11:22.778
pulled in a couple of favors and got you
some time with your sister.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.481
Jen, where is she ?

11:25.593 --> 11:27.390
I'll see you in there, Hopper.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.311
Oh, my god.

11:29.325 --> 11:31.725
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. I'm fine.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.914
- They said they found a gun.
- No. Well, they did.

11:33.917 --> 11:36.386
- Someone else put it there.
- Who would put-

11:36.402 --> 11:38.975
I don't know. It doesn't matter
because I have an alibi.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.338
Rita Shelton.

11:41.112 --> 11:43.407
Wait, you and Rita,
as in Chad's wife ?

11:43.413 --> 11:45.228
Well, ex-wife, but...

11:46.655 --> 11:48.115
and you didn't tell me.

11:48.149 --> 11:49.889
Well, Jen, we haven't been
talking as much as we-

11:49.906 --> 11:52.651
never mind about that. I wanna know about
those six hang ups from last night.

11:52.665 --> 11:54.609
And don't give me that mess
about the phones.

11:54.615 --> 11:57.227
- I told you it was nothing.
- Is everything ok between you and Randall ?

11:57.233 --> 11:59.251
- Of course.
- Jen, I...

12:13.852 --> 12:16.150
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Who you killin'now ?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.673
Chad.

12:19.252 --> 12:20.300
Jennifer.

12:20.575 --> 12:21.864
You're lookin'well.

12:22.782 --> 12:24.272
Come on, partner.

12:24.316 --> 12:25.808
Time to face the music.

12:27.846 --> 12:29.843
Boy, you know, cops will pull
a lot of crazy stunts

12:29.848 --> 12:32.126
to weasel out of a meeting
with internal affairs.

12:32.141 --> 12:34.545
But committing a murder,
that definitely wins a prize,

12:34.559 --> 12:35.627
huh, Hopper ?

12:35.643 --> 12:38.015
You have an ugly smile.
People say that about you,

12:38.086 --> 12:39.983
especially women.

12:40.953 --> 12:43.291
We'll meet you up on four, guys.

12:43.305 --> 12:46.118
I need a little quality time
with my old partner here.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.564
I said we'll you up on four.

12:50.505 --> 12:51.520
Come on.

12:58.993 --> 13:01.119
You get the score
of the dodger game ?

13:05.236 --> 13:07.370
I know Andrea is a dirty cop.
You're gonna help me prove it.

13:07.384 --> 13:09.377
Yeah, I got a few other things
on my mind right now

13:09.392 --> 13:12.281
besides what my partner
may or may not be into.

13:12.295 --> 13:14.661
Yeah, this whole "murdering
the assistant D.A." thing.

13:14.676 --> 13:16.979
- it's a real shame, isn't it ?
- You know this thing screams setup from

13:16.996 --> 13:20.135
- from, like a mile away.
- Setup ? No, they got you cold, man.

13:20.139 --> 13:22.139
Weapon, prints...

13:22.250 --> 13:24.355
but you got an alibi, right ?
Rita ?

13:25.318 --> 13:27.712
Been spending a lot of time
with her lately.

13:28.149 --> 13:30.905
When you gonna make an honest woman
of her, get married already ?

13:31.686 --> 13:34.494
Tell the truth. It bugs you
she kept my last name, doesn't it ?

13:35.668 --> 13:37.677
You need a breath mint.

13:40.109 --> 13:42.135
Here's what I don't understand.

13:42.325 --> 13:43.951
You don't want to break some unspoken
code

13:43.964 --> 13:46.491
by turning in your partner,
yet you got no problem sleeping with

13:46.505 --> 13:48.081
- another man's wife ?
- You were divorced,

13:48.088 --> 13:49.753
and we weren't partners anymore.

13:49.765 --> 13:51.824
You expect me to believe
those years we rolled together,

13:51.839 --> 13:54.075
- you never-
- It never happened, Chad.

13:54.092 --> 13:55.104
Never.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.718
How is she these days,
my little Rita ?

14:03.971 --> 14:06.689
It's been a while, but there's
certain things you just never forget.

14:06.704 --> 14:08.540
You know, like in the shower.

14:11.419 --> 14:13.583
you better watch it, convict.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.269
You play this right,
I can help you.

14:16.915 --> 14:18.398
But you screw with me...

14:27.264 --> 14:28.736
Shelton.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.019
Why do I get the feeling you
know more than you're telling ?

14:34.477 --> 14:35.698
Because I do.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.388
And due to the severity
of the crime

14:40.402 --> 14:42.287
and the physical evidence
against the suspect,

14:42.301 --> 14:43.822
the county requests no bail.

14:43.835 --> 14:45.788
- We ask-
- Your honor, the District Attorney's office

14:45.802 --> 14:48.425
has been made aware of
an exculpatory witness

14:48.439 --> 14:51.273
- who can attest my client's whereabouts-
- a witness that we can't locate at this time

14:51.277 --> 14:53.489
your honor. We consider the suspect
to be a danger

14:53.505 --> 14:55.370
- and a flight risk, and we ask-
- flight risk ?

14:55.382 --> 14:58.113
He's a decorated 12-year veteran
of the department.

14:58.126 --> 15:01.285
Veteran or not, the people are pursuing
a charge of first-degree murder.

15:01.714 --> 15:03.819
Very well.
People's request is granted.

15:03.832 --> 15:07.010
Suspect will be held without bail
and remanded to county jail.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.957
Preliminary hearing is set
for a week from today,

15:08.974 --> 15:11.022
whether or not this witness
has been produced.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.880
Dismissed.

15:13.988 --> 15:15.260
Find Rita.

15:17.997 --> 15:20.907
<i>...these series in the books.
A single here, a double there,</i>

15:21.154 --> 15:23.036
<i>and the Dodgers
pull off an amazing</i>

15:23.051 --> 15:25.596
<i>7- run rally in the 9th</i>

15:25.604 --> 15:27.697
<i>to beat the Giants 11-10.</i>

15:27.711 --> 15:30.423
<i>Folks, it just doesn't get
any better than this.</i>

16:12.329 --> 16:13.903
What is this ?

16:15.097 --> 16:16.610
Where am I ?

16:18.023 --> 16:19.516
Chad, is that you ?

16:20.269 --> 16:22.939
Is this how internal affairs
is running things now ?

16:25.351 --> 16:27.984
Now that's enough
questions, detective Hopper.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.822
You're going to admit to killing

16:30.969 --> 16:32.886
Alberto Garza.

16:33.810 --> 16:34.965
What ?

16:35.729 --> 16:36.768
Garza,

16:36.995 --> 16:39.272
the assistant D.A.
You're going to confess.

16:39.275 --> 16:42.435
I'm not gonna do a damn thing.
Who the hell are you people ?

16:44.272 --> 16:46.472
you know, you really need
to get over

16:46.489 --> 16:49.783
this tough guy persona.
It's not going to help you here.

16:50.735 --> 16:52.036
Show him.

16:58.975 --> 17:02.108
You know firsthand how
dangerous this city can be.

17:07.624 --> 17:10.037
Anything can happen
to anyone.

17:10.819 --> 17:13.875
- Rita.
- Random acts of assault and battery,

17:14.022 --> 17:15.179
rape...

17:16.523 --> 17:17.776
carjacking.

17:31.488 --> 17:33.648
I'm gonna kill you !

17:33.971 --> 17:35.642
I'm gonna kill you !

17:35.658 --> 17:38.080
- I will kill you !
- Calm down.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.664
There's more.

17:44.979 --> 17:46.260
No.

17:49.726 --> 17:53.013
Don't worry. Your sister
and the kids are okay.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.679
I swear to God,

17:58.696 --> 18:00.254
I will find you.

18:00.269 --> 18:01.268
Well,

18:01.274 --> 18:03.848
whatever you do
is your choice, detective,

18:04.909 --> 18:06.667
but just remember,

18:06.683 --> 18:08.202
for every decision...

18:08.219 --> 18:10.707
- I'm gonna kill you.
- There's a consequence.

18:11.594 --> 18:13.019
Relax.

18:13.283 --> 18:15.244
Just a mild sedative.

18:15.927 --> 18:17.354
We'd like you to...

18:17.464 --> 18:19.041
unwind.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.619
Sleep on it.

18:23.285 --> 18:24.631
Remember...

18:26.150 --> 18:27.671
decision...

18:28.357 --> 18:29.936
consequence.

18:32.432 --> 18:33.492
Decision...

18:34.592 --> 18:36.026
consequence.

18:37.391 --> 18:39.028
decision...

18:39.741 --> 18:41.596
consequence.

19:23.355 --> 19:25.131
What was that for ?

19:25.702 --> 19:27.608
I had the worst nightmare.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.243
It was so real.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.580
Are you okay ?

19:34.279 --> 19:37.103
Yeah. Yeah. I just...
I feel a little sore.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.864
Brett, what's wrong ?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.667
You ever have a déjà vu ?

20:04.297 --> 20:07.150
Yeah. Gives me the creeps
when that happens.

20:08.679 --> 20:09.864
<i>...on the freeways today.</i>

20:09.876 --> 20:11.645
<i>Starting out, out here
on the westside,</i>

20:11.669 --> 20:14.493
<i>we've got a sigalert
on the northbound 405 at the 10</i>

20:14.508 --> 20:16.593
<i>due to an overturned semi.</i>

20:16.608 --> 20:18.869
<i>- It spilled over a hundred cases of...
- diapers.</i>

20:18.882 --> 20:21.206
<i>All across
the lanes of traffic...</i>

20:21.221 --> 20:22.731
Brett ?

20:22.746 --> 20:24.927
Baby, you don't...
you don't look so good.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.536
I need a shower.

20:30.256 --> 20:31.286
Slow down.

20:31.294 --> 20:33.713
- What happened ?
- Oh, my side.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.975
Did I shave last night ?

20:40.988 --> 20:43.046
What ?
No. Why ?

20:47.442 --> 20:49.968
What happened ?
I gotta go walk Rambis.

21:20.211 --> 21:22.989
You gotta be kidding me.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.409
<i>You have nine messages.</i>

21:27.452 --> 21:29.512
<i>- Message seven.
- Damn it, where you at ?</i>

21:29.516 --> 21:31.573
- It's me, Damien.
- Turn on your cell phone !

21:33.552 --> 21:34.911
Yes, Rita Shelton.

21:34.923 --> 21:36.530
When she gets in,
tell her not to go any-

21:36.545 --> 21:38.651
Jen, stay at home with the kids
today. Don't go to school.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.827
- Call me at the second where you got it.
- Your place !

21:40.831 --> 21:42.842
I need a patrol car
right outside her apartment.

21:42.857 --> 21:44.519
In your closet.

21:46.767 --> 21:49.240
- It's pretty stupid move, man.
- ... the murder weapon with your prints on it.

21:49.253 --> 21:51.608
Why would you hang on
to something like that ?

21:52.006 --> 21:53.438
My name ?

21:54.250 --> 21:55.491
Detective Spivak.

22:13.928 --> 22:16.074
he just dropped it
in the water.

22:21.075 --> 22:22.498
Rita Shelton.
Where is she ?

22:22.512 --> 22:25.385
- I'm sorry, sir, you need to wait.
- I'm detective Hopper. I called earlier.

22:25.391 --> 22:27.762
- I need to see her now.
- She's not here now.

22:28.249 --> 22:29.900
What do you mean she's not here ?
Her shift started at 8 :00.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.879
She called in and said
she was taking a vacation day.

22:32.303 --> 22:34.428
A vacation day ? She never said
anything to me about-

22:34.540 --> 22:35.732
Out of the way.

22:36.496 --> 22:39.616
Massive trauma to her head,
internal bleeding, multiple fractures.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.200
- What happened ?
- Bus crash.

22:41.215 --> 22:43.126
Driver had a stroke,
went out of control.

22:44.647 --> 22:45.600
Miss...

22:45.989 --> 22:47.377
you dropped this.

22:53.490 --> 22:56.352
- Crash cart ready.
- Move her into bay three.

22:56.837 --> 22:58.310
I didn't go for coffee.

23:03.570 --> 23:04.380
+

23:11.621 --> 23:14.457
This is not a request.
You will sit in my office

23:14.471 --> 23:16.363
until you learn to...

23:16.560 --> 23:17.563
B rett ?

23:19.696 --> 23:21.026
What are you doing here ?

23:21.844 --> 23:22.763
Randall.

23:23.265 --> 23:24.451
I'm gonna kill him.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.565
You're dismissed.

23:34.582 --> 23:36.909
Don't you ever touch
my sister again.

23:37.527 --> 23:39.622
From the assignment
last night,

23:39.626 --> 23:41.358
who can tell me what country

23:41.363 --> 23:43.219
Jules Verne was referring to ?

23:45.180 --> 23:47.478
Brett, what are you doing here ?

23:48.419 --> 23:50.479
<i>- Security to first floor west.
- I can't find Rita.</i>

23:50.492 --> 23:52.327
She's missing, so they're probably
watching you.

23:52.344 --> 23:53.824
Rita ?
Rita who ?

23:56.210 --> 23:57.528
Never mind.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.348
You're in danger.
I need you to get the kids,

23:59.365 --> 24:01.755
get in a car and just drive.
Don't tell me where you're going.

24:01.771 --> 24:03.791
- Don't tell Randall. But it's gotta be now.
- What is wrong with you ?

24:03.803 --> 24:06.485
- You're acting really crazy.
- There isn't any time !

24:06.499 --> 24:08.105
- What is this about, brett ?
- Just do what I say

24:08.121 --> 24:09.763
and go far away from here.

24:09.778 --> 24:11.480
What did you do ?

24:13.559 --> 24:15.758
- Just go. Go.
- Go get the kids.

24:29.016 --> 24:30.739
What if I pull the wrong block ?

24:30.752 --> 24:32.897
Then we start the game over,
all right ?

24:35.136 --> 24:36.301
Hopper ?

24:36.631 --> 24:37.489
Andrea.

24:37.725 --> 24:39.081
Thanks for coming.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.869
Didn't think you'd call,
considering the circumstances.

24:46.882 --> 24:49.362
Well, believe me, I didn't have
anyone else to turn.

24:50.710 --> 24:52.555
Good to know
you think so highly of me.

24:52.831 --> 24:54.322
I didn't mean it like that.

24:54.414 --> 24:56.834
Listen, I need you to do me a favor
in case I get caught again.

24:58.461 --> 24:59.826
Again ?
What do you mean ?

25:00.424 --> 25:01.764
Never mind.
I need your help.

25:02.208 --> 25:05.120
I can't find Rita, and I think
that she may be in danger.

25:05.431 --> 25:08.408
Now look, I know that you got
your own troubles to deal with right now,

25:08.424 --> 25:11.719
- butI didn't say anything to I.A. about what-
- let's just stick to your problem, okay ?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.280
Tell me what happened with Garza.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.759
Garza ?

25:18.772 --> 25:20.435
Why would you ask me...

25:44.310 --> 25:45.679
I'm sorry.

26:20.638 --> 26:22.554
Move ! Get out of my way !
Get out of my way !

26:22.798 --> 26:23.693
Move !

26:52.948 --> 26:54.845
Move ! Move !

27:04.725 --> 27:05.930
I got him.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.710
We got him.
Suspect's on the Westbound train.

27:13.722 --> 27:15.395
Cover all exits.

27:22.777 --> 27:24.460
<i>Doors closing.</i>

27:25.173 --> 27:27.011
<i>Doors closing.</i>

27:27.601 --> 27:29.495
<i>Doors closing.</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:07.963
Great minds, huh ?

28:10.740 --> 28:11.460
+

28:13.236 --> 28:14.736
If you want a lweyer, it's fine.

28:15.593 --> 28:17.795
Might as well tattoo the word "guilty"
right across your forehead.

28:17.809 --> 28:19.233
I know I'm clean.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.672
Y'all ain't got nothing.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.705
How about the murder weapon ?

28:22.902 --> 28:24.634
I don't know what you talking about.

28:24.648 --> 28:25.746
Really ?

28:25.762 --> 28:28.874
So you're saying the dive teams won't find
anything off the Santa Monica pier ?

28:31.967 --> 28:33.697
...in the water.

28:34.470 --> 28:36.123
oh, I think we hit a nerve.

28:36.138 --> 28:37.878
Who's feeding you this crap ?

28:38.018 --> 28:40.074
- Who's your source ?
- You're not asking the questions, Hopper.

28:40.078 --> 28:43.412
We are.
Now why did you kill Garza ?

28:57.839 --> 29:00.244
You wanted the phone.

29:01.668 --> 29:04.002
<i>- Message seven.
- Damn it, where you at ?</i>

29:04.016 --> 29:06.600
<i>It's me, Damien.
Turn on your cell phone !</i>

29:06.950 --> 29:08.404
<i>They hit the safe house, Hop.</i>

29:08.563 --> 29:10.276
<i>You need to come get my ass !</i>

29:10.432 --> 29:12.527
<i>Look, I'll be layin'low where
you first got it all started,</i>

29:12.533 --> 29:13.917
<i>you know what I'm saying ?</i>

29:13.990 --> 29:15.615
<i>Meet me there at 9 :00
tomorrow night.</i>

29:15.629 --> 29:17.331
Ah, that's tonight.

29:17.569 --> 29:19.806
<i>- Message eight.
- All right, time's up.</i>

29:19.840 --> 29:22.100
<i>Hopper, you should have
received a package today.</i>

29:22.114 --> 29:24.133
<i>- Let's go.
- It's important. Don't let anyone-</i>

29:25.892 --> 29:27.711
Bad engouh you're in here
for murder.

29:27.743 --> 29:29.744
You had to kick the crap out
of your brother-in-law, too ?

29:29.748 --> 29:31.854
It felt necessary and good.

29:31.868 --> 29:33.521
Well, that's great.

29:33.546 --> 29:35.537
Anyway, I spoke
to your sister. And...

29:35.645 --> 29:37.733
she's trying to get him
to drop the charges,

29:37.746 --> 29:40.524
- but he's pretty pissed off.
- Wait, she's still with him ?

29:40.555 --> 29:42.423
Yeah, at the hospital.

29:42.445 --> 29:44.877
They're still picking the glass
out of his back.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.225
Okay, listen, Colburn...
Barry,

29:47.357 --> 29:49.603
I need you to do me a favor
and get my sister and her kids

29:49.620 --> 29:51.293
someplace safe.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.893
- Why ?
- Please don't ask me questions. Just do it.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.761
- What about you ?
- Don't worry about me.

29:55.806 --> 29:58.745
- I'll get out of here soon enough.
- Yeah, that's what they all say.

30:01.338 --> 30:04.365
Stinkin'dodgers, down six runs
going into the ninth.

30:04.380 --> 30:07.959
I had to turn it off.
Meet you up on four, guys.

30:07.976 --> 30:10.875
I need a little quality time
with my old partner here.

30:11.129 --> 30:12.508
Don't worry, fellas.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.253
I'll be gentle.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.270
You want to know a secret, Chad ?

30:25.457 --> 30:27.456
The dodgers rally in the ninth.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.234
They win.

30:32.181 --> 30:33.463
Where is Rita ?

30:37.685 --> 30:39.954
You are itching
for a toe tag, aren't ya ?

30:43.854 --> 30:45.870
Who is behind this, huh ?!

30:45.876 --> 30:48.816
- Who's watching ? Where's Rita ?
- You are certifiable.

30:48.830 --> 30:50.877
I'll make sure you end up
on death row.

31:52.665 --> 31:54.863
You believe
in second chances, Andrea ?

31:57.540 --> 31:58.080
+

32:00.714 --> 32:03.184
You cut a deal with I.A.
to bring me in, yes or no ?

32:03.197 --> 32:05.206
I'm not proud of it, okay.

32:05.584 --> 32:07.364
But I.A. Is convinced
I'm taking a payoff from-

32:07.378 --> 32:08.909
- Are you ?
- No !

32:21.190 --> 32:24.273
You shouldn't keep that thing under
your mattress. I found it in 30 seconds.

32:24.613 --> 32:26.583
What are you doing
in my home, Hopper ?

32:26.857 --> 32:29.039
I need to know
if I can trust you...

32:29.658 --> 32:31.377
if we're still partners.

32:31.768 --> 32:32.883
Partners ?

32:33.992 --> 32:36.616
You've been giving your partner
the cold shoulder the last six months.

32:36.631 --> 32:38.716
Now you're wanted for murder,
and you're telling me Rita's missing.

32:38.731 --> 32:40.960
- What the hell is going on with you ?
- I don't know. I'm...

32:42.123 --> 32:44.125
I'm just trying
to get control of this day.

32:44.137 --> 32:45.554
This day is over.

32:45.566 --> 32:47.366
You gotta worry about tomorrow.

32:52.915 --> 32:55.430
This... mess you're in...

32:56.374 --> 32:59.870
have anything to do with the fact you've been
looking into the latin disciples ?

33:01.277 --> 33:04.129
- Where did you hear that ?
- Don't worry. I haven't told anyone.

33:09.743 --> 33:12.587
I'm working this case
for the U.S. Attorney's office.

33:12.738 --> 33:14.563
It's strictly confidential.

33:14.580 --> 33:17.250
We flipped this kid, Damien Ortiz,
against the disciples.

33:17.697 --> 33:19.906
- Trial's tomorrow. Now he's on the run.
- If they're after this kid,

33:19.911 --> 33:22.466
- they're gonna get to him.
- Hopefully not before I do.

33:23.575 --> 33:24.817
Think the disciples
have something to do

33:24.820 --> 33:27.099
- with Rita going missing ?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

33:28.627 --> 33:30.560
I need you
to search her place for me,

33:30.574 --> 33:32.094
check for signs of a struggle,

33:32.109 --> 33:33.957
- run a trace on-
- cell pho, yeah.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.192
Done this before.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.736
Does that mean
you're gonna help me ?

33:43.610 --> 33:45.051
You're gonna need this.

33:52.750 --> 33:54.123
Thanks.

33:54.446 --> 33:55.900
Where you headed ?

33:57.390 --> 33:58.459
I'm going clubbing.

34:04.717 --> 34:06.795
Hey.
I'm Damien's 9 :00.

34:07.317 --> 34:08.855
Come on through.

34:09.156 --> 34:10.773
Arms out to your side.

34:10.786 --> 34:12.136
Turn around.

34:13.155 --> 34:14.858
What do you got here ?

34:15.458 --> 34:16.353
Nice.

34:23.916 --> 34:24.900
Easy !

34:26.067 --> 34:27.989
Oh, no.
Listen, wait, wait, wait.

34:28.001 --> 34:29.273
You don't wanna do this, okay ?

34:29.299 --> 34:31.681
Get Damien, and we can
discuss this like men.

34:31.751 --> 34:33.070
Stop, stop !

34:51.833 --> 34:54.295
you think that first step's a bitch ?
Wait till the next one.

34:55.038 --> 34:57.247
Turned me against my own only
so you could sell my ass out ?

34:57.263 --> 34:58.494
I didn't sell you out.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.144
- Tell me what happened.
- You know what happened.

35:01.146 --> 35:03.119
Your safe house
was a death trap.

35:03.133 --> 35:06.485
Why would I be here helping you
while I'm on the run for murder ?

35:07.409 --> 35:09.225
- Murder ?
- Yeah.

35:09.243 --> 35:12.316
- Hey, yo, who you playin'?
- Hey, hey, don't you watch the news ?

35:12.329 --> 35:14.845
I'm wanted for killing
an assistant D.A.

35:19.348 --> 35:21.954
You gotta tell me exactly
what happened, D., All right ?

35:21.968 --> 35:24.551
'Cause only a handful of people
knew where we were hiding you.

35:24.566 --> 35:26.165
Yeah, well,
somebody said something, eh ?

35:26.446 --> 35:28.830
'Cause them feds that's supposed to be
looking out for me, protecting my ass,

35:28.845 --> 35:30.230
are long gone.

35:30.233 --> 35:32.456
I wake up, don't hear nobody in the house.
Check the window ?

35:32.468 --> 35:34.123
All the cars are gone.

35:34.139 --> 35:36.196
See some skinheaded fools
coming my way...

35:36.210 --> 35:38.458
- strapped.
- Wait, skinheads ?

35:38.474 --> 35:40.020
- Not disciples ?
- Nah,

35:40.025 --> 35:41.920
some good ol'hog-ridin'boys.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.645
Look, I ain't no fool, Hop.

35:43.662 --> 35:45.901
I figure the L. D.'s farmed it out,
make it look like some other crew.

35:45.916 --> 35:48.299
All right, did any of these disciples
say anything about Garza

35:48.582 --> 35:50.944
- or me ?
- You ?

35:51.371 --> 35:54.099
Nah, this is bigger
than you or some D.A., Man.

35:54.113 --> 35:56.736
- I need names, Damien.
- You're crazy.

35:57.012 --> 35:59.472
Our deal's off, Hop.
You on your own.

36:01.156 --> 36:02.657
Just give me one name, D.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.898
Forget about feds,
forget about Baxter, all right ?

36:04.913 --> 36:07.230
I will personally find you
protection myself.

36:08.481 --> 36:10.970
- Nah, man. I don't think so.
- You're making a mistake.

36:10.985 --> 36:12.906
Just give me a-

36:34.673 --> 36:37.239
you people know you just blew away
a federal witness ?

36:38.213 --> 36:39.991
Or is that part of the plan ?

36:40.004 --> 36:43.002
Forget the kid. We have business
to discuss, detective Hopper.

36:43.016 --> 36:45.650
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know what you're capable of.

36:45.913 --> 36:47.672
I know you can get at Rita

36:47.686 --> 36:49.436
and my sister and her kids.

36:49.452 --> 36:51.594
But if you want me
to take the fall for Garza,

36:51.610 --> 36:54.204
you better not touch them.
You understand me ?

36:55.732 --> 36:57.878
How did you know
this was about Garza ?

36:57.893 --> 36:59.939
You're the one behind
the curtain. You tell me.

37:02.994 --> 37:06.172
I need to know how you came
to this information.

37:06.494 --> 37:09.242
What are you talking about ?
You told me last time I was here.

37:10.703 --> 37:12.328
You think this is a game ?

37:12.342 --> 37:14.210
Oh, no.

37:14.339 --> 37:16.135
Okay, listen, listen,

37:16.153 --> 37:19.245
I'll do whatever you tell me.
Just don't hurt them !

37:19.969 --> 37:21.346
A little late for that.

37:22.214 --> 37:22.775
No !

37:23.451 --> 37:24.585
No !

37:25.922 --> 37:27.887
- For every decision...
- No.

37:28.188 --> 37:30.245
There's a consequence.

37:33.048 --> 37:34.205
Why ?!

37:34.279 --> 37:36.662
Tell me why this is happening !

37:38.374 --> 37:39.739
Relax.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.052
Just a mild sedative.

37:42.745 --> 37:45.156
We'd like you to...
unwind...

37:46.782 --> 37:48.226
Sleep on it.

37:49.843 --> 37:51.611
But remember,

37:52.010 --> 37:53.445
decision...

37:54.254 --> 37:55.871
consequence.

37:58.953 --> 38:00.059
decision...

38:01.130 --> 38:02.977
consequence.

38:04.074 --> 38:07.743
decision...
consequence.
