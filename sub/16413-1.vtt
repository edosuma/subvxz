(CLOCK TICKING)

00:41.640 --> 00:43.165
(ALARM RINGING)

00:48.840 --> 00:50.922
DRACULAURA: Normal is relative.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.887
Normal is about how you feel,

00:56.960 --> 01:00.328
not about how you look or what you do.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.201
Normal is different for everyone.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.966
(BURPS)

01:14.840 --> 01:16.205
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

01:18.680 --> 01:20.967
Okay, so it may seem weird to you

01:21.040 --> 01:25.250
that a bunch of swamp monsters,
poltergeists, vampires and mummies

01:25.320 --> 01:27.561
are all going to school together.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.166
But for me, that's normal.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.448
BOTH: Welcome to Monster High!

01:36.920 --> 01:40.891
DRACULAURA:
Perhaps, I should start at the beginning.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.764
(MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)

02:16.080 --> 02:17.570
(DRACULAURA HUMMING)

02:17.880 --> 02:19.325
(SINGING) ...top of the world...

02:19.400 --> 02:22.051
DRACULAURA: For those of you
tuning in for the first time,

02:22.400 --> 02:23.845
I'm Draculaura.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.490
I'm not like other people.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.483
But then again, who is?

02:30.600 --> 02:31.726
(SINGING) ...amazing...

02:31.920 --> 02:33.160
(CONTINUES HUMMING)

02:33.920 --> 02:35.081
Draculaura?

02:38.560 --> 02:39.925
Come on, Draculaura.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.923
- Are you ready?
- Hey, Dad!

02:42.000 --> 02:44.321
Oh. Right. It's tonight.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.966
(SIGHS) I can do this.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.449
Why don't we try this some other time?

02:51.520 --> 02:53.682
When you're more comfortable.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.762
I'm perfectly comfortable now, Dad.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.683
I'm just saying.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.969
Now remember, you can
never be too cautious.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.441
The outside world is a scary place,

03:03.520 --> 03:04.885
filled with

03:04.960 --> 03:07.440
humans!

03:07.520 --> 03:11.047
Oh no! Not the humans!

03:11.120 --> 03:13.088
This is no laughing matter!

03:13.160 --> 03:14.605
They may look innocent enough,

03:14.680 --> 03:18.048
but humans are one of the most
dangerous species on Earth.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.360
Dangerous? (SCOFFS)

03:19.440 --> 03:23.206
More dangerous than a swarm
of killer robot bees? (BUZZING)

03:23.640 --> 03:25.961
I was about to make a very critical point.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.041
"Stay away from humans."

03:27.120 --> 03:29.202
Stay away from humans!

03:29.280 --> 03:31.487
It's essential that you
never let one see you.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.170
They're just not ready to accept us.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.890
At least not yet.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.644
Promise me. Vamp's honor.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.241
(SIGHS) I promise!

03:41.320 --> 03:42.810
Now, if you don't mind...

03:55.160 --> 03:56.924
(GROANS)

03:57.000 --> 04:00.800
Not all vampires get the bat
transformation on their first try.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.644
Two times the charm.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.321
Ah!

04:09.200 --> 04:10.281
(GRUNTING)

04:11.720 --> 04:13.165
That's my ghoul!

04:15.480 --> 04:16.810
- Oh.
- Ah!

04:19.399 --> 04:20.401
I'm all right!

04:21.440 --> 04:22.441
I got this!

04:22.840 --> 04:23.841
So close!

04:24.280 --> 04:25.486
Maybe not!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.206
(SCREAMING)

04:38.320 --> 04:41.483
(GRUNTS) I can't do this. It's impossible.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.762
Not impossible. Just challenging.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.289
Come on, let's try it together.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.206
One, two...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.324
(EXCLAIMING)

05:17.920 --> 05:19.729
(LAUGHING) I did it!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.765
That's my ghoul.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.201
(LAUGHS)

06:11.840 --> 06:12.887
(POP SONG PLAYING)

06:12.960 --> 06:14.644
Tash!

06:21.600 --> 06:23.648
Drac. Drac.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.805
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yes, fine, I think.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.965
One must never get
distracted whilst flying.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.290
What were you thinking?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.368
Pop, um, can I ask you something?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.365
Okay, there's this amazing girl, Tash.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.887
She's such a big star. All the normal
girls my age are obsessed with her.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.725
Normal girls? You mean human girls.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.406
Tash is totally, undeniably creeptastic!

06:54.480 --> 06:55.641
Cut to the chase.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.449
Can I go to her concert?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.927
It's only, like, three towns over,
and I'll be super-careful!

07:00.000 --> 07:02.287
Please? Pretty, pretty please,
with cobwebs on top!

07:02.400 --> 07:04.084
Drac, no, I'm sorry.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.009
- It's just too dangerous.
- I just...

07:06.080 --> 07:09.448
Monsters do not belong in the human world.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.329
Then where do we belong?

07:12.720 --> 07:15.769
Wait! Drac! Come back!

07:27.520 --> 07:31.161
(GRUNTS) "The human world
is too dangerous, Draculaura."

07:31.240 --> 07:34.767
Well, I'm in danger of losing my mind.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.769
Drac! Draculaura, where are you?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.565
Here.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.644
DRACULA: What were you thinking?
Someone could have seen you.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.167
I mean, I'm almost 1,600 years old.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.210
I'm extremely responsible,
I do all my chores,

08:11.280 --> 08:14.489
maintain every single cobweb
in this house, and...

08:14.560 --> 08:18.326
And I'll always be stuck here,
hiding in the attic,

08:18.400 --> 08:20.209
hidden from the world.

08:20.280 --> 08:25.081
But at least I have you guys.
My trusty Vampology Vlog followers.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.891
Well, if any of my fellow weirdos
are out there listening,

08:31.960 --> 08:33.371
have a good evening.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.010
I'm off to bed.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.842
- (CLEARING THROAT)
- Oh. Uh...

08:38.000 --> 08:40.287
Yeah, I was just, um...

08:44.680 --> 08:49.049
How about I make us a nice pot of bat tea?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.724
- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- (BOTH GASP)

08:52.360 --> 08:54.124
- (CONTINUES RINGING)
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

08:56.320 --> 08:57.845
Someone's at the door?

08:57.920 --> 09:00.491
Nobody's rung that bell for 150 years!

09:00.600 --> 09:02.682
GIRL: Hey, I know you're in there.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.201
No one saw you, right?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.884
Of course not. I was...

09:06.960 --> 09:10.248
GIRL: I saw you today.
I saw you turn into a bat.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.881
Oops.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.804
You can open up. I'm one of you.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.641
(GASPS)

09:23.800 --> 09:25.484
No, what are you doing!

09:25.600 --> 09:26.761
She's one of us!

09:38.560 --> 09:39.561
(CHIRPS)

09:42.320 --> 09:45.164
- Bat tea?
- Thanks, Mr. D.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.720
It's really lovely of you
to have me stay here.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.964
She can share my bedroom.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.087
Oh, whoa, whoa!

09:54.160 --> 09:57.243
Let's just pump the proverbial
brakes here for a minute.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.402
I haven't seen another monster in decades.

09:59.480 --> 10:03.280
We still don't know who she is
or where she came from. Hmm?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.370
Like I said, I'm Frankie.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.001
My pops is Frankenstein.

10:09.080 --> 10:13.121
After the great monster Fright Flight,
he went into hiding like all other monsters.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.771
Things get a bit boring when
you're hiding out all by yourself.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.086
Tell me about it.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.840
Come on. You can't send her back.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.366
I never had a real friend before.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.566
You have Webby.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.926
He's a spider, Dad!

10:27.480 --> 10:28.925
Please?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.889
My answer is final.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.247
(WHIMPERING)

10:33.080 --> 10:34.570
That's not going to work with me.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.886
I'm telling you, you're wasting your time.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.566
(WHIMPERING)

10:49.720 --> 10:52.564
Enough! Okay! She can stay!

10:53.480 --> 10:54.606
DRACULAURA: Favorite color?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.326
FRANKIE: Mmm... Electric blue. You?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.971
Black. Definitely black.
Oh, but also pink.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.849
Oh, oh, and sunlight.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.924
You're a vampire,
don't you burn in sunlight?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.651
No, silly. That's only in the movies.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.846
Favorite song?

11:08.920 --> 11:12.481
That's a no-brainer. Flawless.
It's Tash's new hit single.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.607
Who's Tash?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.084
Who's Tash?

11:16.200 --> 11:19.044
Have you been hiding
under a rock your whole life?

11:19.120 --> 11:22.522
Tash is the most coolest, most awesome,
amazing, beautiful, amazing rocker.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.410
I have all of her albums,
and I've seen all of her videos,

11:25.480 --> 11:28.768
even the super-obscure one
that she shot secretly in Tokyo.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.764
Oh. She's a Normie.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.281
What's that?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.647
Normie, normal. A human.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.121
Okay, big deal. So, she's a Normie.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.605
Don't you think it's a bit unfair that humans
are the only ones who get to be normal?

11:41.720 --> 11:43.882
I mean, who decided that
turning into a bat

11:43.960 --> 11:45.883
and sleeping in a coffin was weird?

11:45.960 --> 11:47.246
Tell me about it.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.762
Just because I need a few stitches
to stay together, I'm still a person.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.171
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like to be normal?

11:55.240 --> 11:56.730
I don't know.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.041
Being normal never really vibed with me.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.646
But it would be nice
to do some normal things.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.246
Like have friends.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.288
Oh! And throw parties.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.210
FRANKIE: And hang at a coffee shop
and order elaborate-sounding drinks.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.487
It could be a coffin shop!

12:13.560 --> 12:15.164
I love it!

12:15.240 --> 12:18.050
And it could be right in the center
of our little monster village,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.691
where monsters of all kinds
could come to live together.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.564
DRACULAURA: And go to school together.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.041
FRANKIE: A real school.

12:25.160 --> 12:29.802
DRACULAURA: Oh! We could call it
Draculaura's Academy for Guys and Ghouls!

12:30.400 --> 12:31.970
And beasties.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.724
And others.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.922
Yeah, no, bad idea.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.006
What about School for the Scary,
Strange and...

12:42.080 --> 12:43.809
And Generally Unwelcome!

12:43.880 --> 12:46.406
Or we could just call it

12:46.480 --> 12:49.370
Monster High.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.124
Monster High!

12:51.200 --> 12:54.647
So simple and yet so perfect.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.165
If only we could.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.447
But it's impossible.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.206
Not impossible. Just challenging.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.291
We can't have Monster High without

13:18.480 --> 13:19.845
students.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.849
I say let's go find us some monsters.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.451
Hello? Anybody out there?

13:35.040 --> 13:38.647
Here, little monster-monsters.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.848
(SIGHS) This is hopeless.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.922
Wait. I think I see something.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.725
There!

13:49.920 --> 13:51.160
(GROWLING)

13:51.600 --> 13:52.647
(BOTH GASP)

13:55.040 --> 13:56.166
Mmm.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.841
Forget it, it's just a mouse.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.442
(GASPS) Wait, what about over there?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.125
DRACULAURA: The moors?

14:20.200 --> 14:21.884
Nobody goes out there.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.961
Exactly!

14:23.040 --> 14:25.850
The perfect hiding place for a monster.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.130
Maybe we should turn back.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.085
Um, hello?

14:43.160 --> 14:45.527
You're a vampire.
You can't be afraid of the dark.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.321
I'm not afraid of the dark.
That's ridiculous.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.686
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

14:57.000 --> 14:58.490
(BOTH SHRIEK)

14:59.280 --> 15:00.441
(PUPPY YELPS)

15:02.640 --> 15:05.484
Hey! Stop it! No! That tickles!

15:05.600 --> 15:08.490
Oh! There's a whole pack of little pups.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.566
Oh, aren't you just a little cutie-pootie?

15:12.360 --> 15:13.691
(GROWLING)

15:14.120 --> 15:15.121
(GASPS)

15:17.160 --> 15:19.606
On the count of three, run.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.489
One, two...

15:21.560 --> 15:23.927
Wait! Look at that, around her neck.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.844
Kind of strange for a wild wolf
to be wearing an amulet.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.048
- Unless...
- She's a monster!

15:30.920 --> 15:32.490
I hope we're right.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.368
Excuse me,
but you wouldn't happen to be a...

15:38.840 --> 15:40.251
A werewolf, would you?

15:40.600 --> 15:41.601
(GROWLS)

15:41.680 --> 15:46.525
That's a shame, 'cause we're looking
for other monsters like us.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.771
We're forming a high school
up on the Hill. Monster High.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.486
- It's where monsters can go to be normal.
- Normal-ish.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.364
And we're even gonna have a coffin shop.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.642
With Mummy Mochas and everything.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.407
As a team.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.245
Sure. I'll run for
student council with you.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.526
(LAUGHS)

31:37.600 --> 31:38.647
Yes!

31:43.880 --> 31:45.530
That's right, guys and ghouls,

31:45.640 --> 31:47.927
we're running for Monster High's
very first president.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.240
Co-presidents!

31:49.320 --> 31:53.450
And a vote for Frankie and Drac
is a vote for monsters everywhere.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.126
FRANKIE: We bring to you our vision
of a world in which monsters

31:56.200 --> 32:00.171
can finally live peacefully side
by side with the human world.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.251
I know you're skeptical,
but it can happen.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.881
And we promise to celebrate
with our first ever school dance,

32:06.960 --> 32:09.691
planned by Ms. Cleo de Nile herself.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.808
Dancing the Fright Away.

32:12.280 --> 32:15.170
So remember, vote for Frankie and Drac,

32:15.240 --> 32:16.730
'cause these monsters

32:16.800 --> 32:18.325
- got your back!
- Got your back!

32:18.400 --> 32:21.244
Plus, we're the only ones running.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.969
I think that went well.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.524
(SLURPING)

32:37.920 --> 32:41.129
Vote for Drac and Frankie,
help monsters come out of the dark.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.123
Vote for Frankie and Draculaura,

32:43.200 --> 32:46.841
and we'll have megastar Tash
come to our school dance!

32:46.920 --> 32:48.729
- Really?
- Wow! Tash?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.361
- Too much?
- (STATIC ON PA)

32:50.560 --> 32:54.929
DRACULA: Frankie Stein and Draculaura,
please report to the headmaster's office.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.445
Immediately!

32:57.600 --> 32:58.965
Maybe a little much.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.410
Megastar Tash is coming to your dance?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.564
Doesn't hurt to promise.

33:07.200 --> 33:11.524
You put her face on the poster
for Dance the Fright Away!

33:11.600 --> 33:14.126
Well, Cleo says it's impossible
to say no to royalty.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.851
Plus, I think if Tash got to know us,

33:16.920 --> 33:19.321
she might like us and come.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.845
I think we're very likable.

33:20.920 --> 33:24.766
This is a secret monster high school!

33:24.840 --> 33:25.966
It's just a dance.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.401
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

33:28.640 --> 33:30.369
SECRETARY: Mr. Headmaster, sir.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.284
We've got a situation
with the snack machine.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.521
Can it wait?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.841
I think you'll wanna see this.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.446
DRACULA: What?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.962
How could he even fit?

33:51.120 --> 33:52.690
Oh, Gob!

33:55.040 --> 33:56.849
He didn't say no to the dance.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.321
Which is sort of like
another way of saying...

34:01.120 --> 34:02.281
Yes.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.207
CLAWDEEN: Ghouls.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.760
We have a report
of a monster off the grid.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.606
(CRASHING)

34:08.679 --> 34:12.047
This ghoul hasn't spoken
to another monster in years.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.202
Her name is Moanica.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.288
Oh. Poor Moanica.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.648
Just think how excited
she'll be when we show up.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.641
(ALL GRUNTING)

34:26.159 --> 34:28.606
Are you sure we're in the right place?

Someone actually lives here?

34:45.639 --> 34:47.130
Supposedly.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.610
- And I thought living in a den was bad.

Whoa!

35:20.400 --> 35:21.447
(GASPS)

35:27.200 --> 35:30.682
Who dares trespass my cemetery?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.490
Your cemetery?

35:32.560 --> 35:34.927
Moanica. Moanica D'Kay, right?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.449
- Who's asking?
- Whoa, whoa!

35:37.640 --> 35:40.041
There's no need to get scratchy.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.281
I'm Draculaura.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.331
And this is Cleo, Clawdeen,
Frankie and Lagoona.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.164
We're just like you.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.641
Wrong.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.087
She's telling the truth. We're monsters.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.482
See? Wanna shake on it?

35:54.560 --> 35:56.210
I don't do handshakes,

35:56.360 --> 36:02.242
but I could use a few more monsters
in my Zomboy army.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.686
We've already taken this cemetery
back from the humans.

36:06.760 --> 36:10.321
Next, we'll conquer
the entire human world!

36:12.800 --> 36:15.246
Ooh, nice, very ambitious.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.603
Speaking of ambition, why don't you come
back with us and check out our school?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.765
School? (SCOFFS) You don't get it.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.771
I'm not going anywhere.

Listen, Zomboys,
we have room for you, too.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.680
Yes, everyone is welcome at Monster High.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.361
Why don't we all just take
a deep breath and talk this out?

36:51.440 --> 36:52.601
Ghoul, look at them.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.650
I don't think they talk or breathe.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.691

That's it, boys. I'm done playing nice!

38:44.080 --> 38:47.527
Where's Moanica?
I'd like to finish our conversation.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.205
She's not worth it.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.365
I wish she had listened.

ALL: Exto monstrum!

DRACULAURA: Back at school,
classes were in full swing.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.324
Dad was really getting into
his Humanology class.

39:17.360 --> 39:22.127
Can anyone tell me what this might
be used for in the human world?

39:22.240 --> 39:24.208
- Huh?
- I know.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.841
It's one of those thingies humans
hold to their nose when it leaks!

39:28.640 --> 39:32.804
DRACULAURA: Clawdeen was quickly becoming
Monster High's resident fashionista.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.689
Looking good, Clawdeen.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.411
Uh...

DRACULAURA: Cleo was hard at work
planning Dancing the Fright Away.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.841
Yes, I'm looking to book Tash.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.766
It's an exclusive event.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.841
Cleo?

39:56.920 --> 39:58.410
A little to the left.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.447
What?

39:59.520 --> 40:02.729
What do you mean
it's not important enough?

40:02.800 --> 40:06.088
- Don't you know who I am?
- MAN: Whatever. Bye-bye.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.482
Well, tell your client that
she's the one missing out.

shoo-ins for student council.

I'm telling you, you two are
shoo-ins for student council.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.767
You think?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.366
What if someone else
decides to run against us?

40:33.440 --> 40:38.002
You're the school's founders.
Who would run against you?

40:38.800 --> 40:42.646
MOANICA: Ugh. It's as hideous
as it looks on the website.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.806
Time to put on your happy face, Zomboys.

What are you doing here, Moanica?

41:16.920 --> 41:18.365
Draculaura!

41:18.440 --> 41:20.920
Frankly, I'm a little hurt.

You invited me to this school after all.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.642
"Everyone is welcome."

41:26.720 --> 41:28.848
Isn't that what you said?

41:28.920 --> 41:30.490
She's got a point.

41:30.560 --> 41:33.769
Besides, I had to
see this place for myself.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.568
So many monsters to recruit...

Sorry, Moanica.

You're still in hiding.

42:18.400 --> 42:25.090
If you really want to come out of the dark,
you've gotta remind humans we exist.

Go home, Moanica.
No one wants to hear your nasty plans.

42:31.240 --> 42:35.723
I think we should let the students
decide what they want to hear.

42:39.080 --> 42:42.448
That's right, students of Monster High.

42:42.520 --> 42:48.084
You now have a choice in who you want
to lead this school's student council.

42:48.480 --> 42:53.122
You can vote Frankie and Drac,
the monsters who hide.

Ghoul, please.
No one's going to vote for Moanica.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.764
That zombie's a menace.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.161
I wouldn't be so sure.

44:09.240 --> 44:13.529
I've seen more than one monster in here
wearing a Moanica for President pin.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.121
What does she have that we don't?

44:19.400 --> 44:21.402
Well, for one, pins.

44:21.480 --> 44:24.563
But, two, she's also got a message.

Forget it, ghoul. You got this election.

44:59.280 --> 45:04.047
Now, as we all know,
humans can be quite curious creatures.

45:04.120 --> 45:08.682
A disproportionate part of their day
is spent looking at cat pictures,

45:08.760 --> 45:09.966
like this one.

45:10.520 --> 45:14.081
But while they portray
the feline as the burrito,

Why don't we just eliminate them?

at their feet to make peace.

My fellow monsters.

47:08.240 --> 47:13.167
It seems like just yesterday that this
building was just an old abandoned house,

47:13.240 --> 47:16.369
one that my dad and I
worked hard to make a home.

But it wasn't until we created
Monster High that I truly felt at home.

that feeling to the entire world.

is a vote for kindness...

47:40.960 --> 47:42.371

47:42.440 --> 47:44.647
A vote for Frankie and Drac is a vote

47:44.720 --> 47:47.485

47:47.840 --> 47:48.966
Impossible.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.885
Come along, just be confident
Don't hide in the dark

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.884
Monstars, we're the monstars

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.841
I've been on the sea
And I'm feeling real good

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.522
I'm just being me
Just like a monster should

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.123
Let's have a good time
Live your life out loud

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.125
Visionaries, legendary
Bring that monster out

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.202
We're gonna dance, dance,
dance the fright away

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.807
We are, we are, we are
We're the monstars, monstars

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.726
We are, we are, we are
Come on, let's dance the fright away

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.600
We are, we are, we are
We're the monstars, monstars

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.526
We are, we are, we are
Come on, let's dance the fright away

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.241
We are, we are, we are
We're the monstars, monstars

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.006
We are, we are, we are
Come on, let's dance the fright away

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.520
It's time to celebrate!

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.447
DRACULAURA: Well, mansters, ghouls, creeps
and geeks, you heard it here first.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.000
Monster High is here to stay.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.649
Enjoy your fiesta now.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.451
This isn't the last you'll hear from me.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.209
Come on, Zomboys.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.247
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:32.560
Zomboys!

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.965
And while we monsters haven't quite
learned to live with humans just yet,

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.407
I'm certain the day will still come.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:46.849
In the meantime, we have a pretty
sweet monster ambassador for us

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.843
out in the human world.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.287
DRACULA: Come on, Drac.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.569
You know how I feel
about distracted flying!

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.645
DRACULAURA: Sure, the humans thought
Ari's new look was just a costume,

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:13.045
but for the first time in ages,
monsters were truly coming out of hiding,

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.202
one monster step at a time,

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:19.808
because, as you know,
it's not impossible, just challenging.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.761
Hey!

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.524
I'm trying to impart words of wisdom here!

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.840
Can't you see?

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:27.645
(LAUGHING)

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.444

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.409
