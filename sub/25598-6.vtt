WEBVTT

00:00.124 --> 00:01.275
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

00:01.327 --> 00:03.362
I want to talk to you
about doing more pro bonos.

00:03.363 --> 00:05.135
If you want to take on a pro
Bono, knock yourself out.

00:05.136 --> 00:08.380
What is a COO of a law firm
doing handing out pro bonos

00:08.381 --> 00:09.045
in the first place?

00:09.046 --> 00:10.992
- I just thought that it...
- Rhetorical question, Donna.

00:10.993 --> 00:12.359
I don't care what you thought.

00:12.395 --> 00:13.858
I need you to supervise
Brian Altman.

00:13.859 --> 00:16.122
- Have someone else manage him.
- Damn it, Katrina.

00:16.123 --> 00:17.822
This is your chance
to be senior partner.

00:17.858 --> 00:19.958
I was just thinking about
where we were a week ago

00:19.993 --> 00:21.671
when I thought you were
cold and heartless.

00:21.695 --> 00:23.535
And I went from that
to being your best friend.

00:23.564 --> 00:24.496
I wouldn't say best friend.

00:24.531 --> 00:25.263
You want to know something
about me?

00:25.299 --> 00:26.575
You go ahead and ask.

00:26.576 --> 00:28.452
And how should I trust that
I'd get a straight answer?

00:28.453 --> 00:30.431
Because I am
on this team now.

00:30.432 --> 00:32.698
I've got its
best interests at heart.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.568
<i>- I'm getting a divorce.</i>
- What?

00:34.603 --> 00:36.303
I was hoping
that you could represent me.

00:36.338 --> 00:38.238
It's my brother;
what am I supposed to do?

00:38.273 --> 00:39.784
I think that this could bring
up a lot of shit for you.

00:39.808 --> 00:41.174
He still loves you.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.109
He deserves another chance
as a father.

00:43.145 --> 00:45.123
<i>It was one of the hardest
things I've ever had to do.</i>

00:45.147 --> 00:46.980
I swear
it took a piece of me, Donna.

00:47.015 --> 00:48.448
You could look at it

00:48.483 --> 00:50.483
like you chose to give
a piece of yourself.

00:55.357 --> 00:57.123
Alex.

00:57.159 --> 00:58.124
Can I talk to you
about something?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.226
Sure, Donna,
what's going on?

01:00.262 --> 01:02.829
Well, ever since I got
promoted

01:02.864 --> 01:05.298
I've been looking for
a way to give back.

01:05.334 --> 01:06.711
And it turns out
that a friend of mine

01:06.735 --> 01:09.636
is working for a charity
that helps at-risk girls.

01:09.671 --> 01:12.462
And I figured the best way for
me to give some of my time...

01:12.463 --> 01:14.408
Would be to convince some
lawyers to give some of theirs.

01:14.432 --> 01:15.531
Exactly.

01:15.566 --> 01:18.067
Donna, I'd love to say yes,
but I'm slammed right now.

01:18.102 --> 01:19.179
and a charity
like this deserves

01:19.203 --> 01:20.602
more time than I can offer.

01:20.638 --> 01:23.639
I appreciate you
hearing me out.

01:23.674 --> 01:25.441
I'll find somebody else.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.543
Donna, I have to ask.
Given how it went

01:27.578 --> 01:28.410
the last time you took on
a pro Bono,

01:28.446 --> 01:29.723
have you cleared this
with Robert?

01:29.747 --> 01:32.181
I'd hate to see him bite
your head off a second time.

01:32.216 --> 01:35.017
Trust me, Alex, I don't make
the same mistake twice.

01:35.052 --> 01:36.952
Robert's good with it.

01:36.987 --> 01:39.154
Then I hope you find someone
to handle it for you.

01:47.485 --> 01:49.318
Louis, what can I do for you?

01:49.354 --> 01:51.432
Not me. I'm here about what
you can do for Emmet Ford.

01:51.456 --> 01:52.186
You mean the owner

01:52.187 --> 01:53.941
of the hottest online retailer
in the world.

01:53.942 --> 01:55.319
Yes I do. He wants to
go public; there's a problem;

01:55.343 --> 01:57.210
and you need to drop
everything you're doing.

01:57.245 --> 01:58.456
Louis, I can't right now.
I'm up to

01:58.480 --> 02:00.213
my eyeballs in the
Ratchinson brief.

02:00.248 --> 02:02.026
Then give it to someone else.
This is too important.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.282
Well,
if it's so important,

02:03.318 --> 02:04.462
why don't you
handle it yourself?

02:04.486 --> 02:07.020
I can't.

02:07.055 --> 02:08.888
Louis, what's going on?

02:14.314 --> 02:16.481
Katrina, you need this
to make senior partner.

02:16.517 --> 02:18.350
What? I thought
I had to show Robert

02:18.385 --> 02:19.317
I could manage people

02:19.353 --> 02:21.186
to make senior partner,
which I did.

02:21.221 --> 02:23.321
It's not Robert.
Every partner gets a vote.

02:23.357 --> 02:26.124
And Paul goddamn Porter wants...
Don't tell me.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.627
That douchebag Hanrahan.
Yes.

02:28.662 --> 02:30.595
Katrina, look,
I know I let you down,

02:30.631 --> 02:32.397
and I'm sorry.

02:33.096 --> 02:34.407
But you bring this home,
I promise

02:34.431 --> 02:37.032
you will be senior partner
next quarter.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.934
Okay, Louis.

02:39.837 --> 02:42.337
I'll take care of it.
Good.

02:42.372 --> 02:44.083
Now I have to go deliver
some more shitty news

02:44.107 --> 02:46.227
to someone who's gonna be
less understanding than you.

02:51.734 --> 02:53.345
I get it. You're going
through with the divorce,

02:53.369 --> 02:55.102
but I don't see why you can't...

02:56.272 --> 02:58.172
No, I'm not okay with it,
Marcus,

02:58.207 --> 02:59.840
but I guess I have to be.

03:00.910 --> 03:02.943
Look, I got to go.
Bye.

03:03.281 --> 03:05.281
Louis, whatever it is,
does it have to be now?

03:05.316 --> 03:06.615
I wish it didn't, Harvey,

03:06.651 --> 03:09.184
but I got a call from
Dominic Barone a week ago.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.954
Aston Martin put in offer
to acquire McKernon Motors.

03:11.989 --> 03:13.175
And I assume
you're here to ask

03:13.176 --> 03:15.025
where they should shove
that offer because...

03:15.026 --> 03:17.293
I'm here to tell you
Dominic's taking it.

03:17.328 --> 03:18.472
Louis,
if McKernon is acquired...

03:18.496 --> 03:20.346
Dominic won't be
our client anymore. I know.

03:20.347 --> 03:22.914
Undo it. Nevermind.
I'll call him myself.

03:22.950 --> 03:24.816
Harvey, it is what he wants.

03:24.852 --> 03:25.929
Bullshit, he doesn't know
what he wants.

03:25.953 --> 03:27.052
Yes, he does.

03:27.087 --> 03:28.299
And he's my client now.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.577
It's a done deal,
and I need you to accept

03:29.601 --> 03:31.901
what he wants,
even if it means losing him.

03:31.937 --> 03:33.660
Louis.
I've been looking for you.

03:33.661 --> 03:34.693
Joan Walsh is here.

03:34.729 --> 03:36.488
Wait, what?
She's not on my schedule.

03:36.489 --> 03:37.867
I know.
She says it's an emergency.

03:37.891 --> 03:39.902
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
time for her right now, Donna.

03:39.903 --> 03:42.036
- Why the hell not?
- Because...

03:42.072 --> 03:43.549
I have an appointment
on my other schedule.

03:43.573 --> 03:44.819
What's that supposed to mean?

03:44.820 --> 03:46.431
It means I need to see Sheila
right now, okay?

03:46.455 --> 03:47.521
And you know why.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.913
Let me get this straight.
You're leaving the office

03:49.937 --> 03:50.981
when a client has an emergency

03:51.005 --> 03:52.836
so you can fool around
with your girlfriend.

03:52.837 --> 03:54.020
- Harvey.
- Yes, I am.

03:54.021 --> 03:55.594
And I know this isn't
the best time to ask,

03:55.595 --> 03:56.892
but she is an old client
of yours.

03:56.893 --> 03:58.781
So if you can
please take the meeting,

03:58.782 --> 04:00.665
I will handle whatever it is
when I get back.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.453
Sure, Louis,
you go ahead and enjoy

04:02.488 --> 04:03.679
your afternoon delight.

04:03.714 --> 04:06.148
I'll just be here letting
Dominic sell his company

04:06.184 --> 04:07.944
and babysitting Joan Walsh
while you're gone.

04:13.991 --> 04:17.255
Harvey. What are you
doing here? I was...

04:17.257 --> 04:18.156
Expecting Louis?

04:18.190 --> 04:19.750
Well,
he's not available right now,

04:19.752 --> 04:21.435
but I hear you have
an emergency, Joan.

04:21.437 --> 04:22.803
So why don't you read me in.

04:22.839 --> 04:26.941
A model named Daisy Jones
posted a video claiming

04:26.976 --> 04:28.849
my concealer gave her
an allergic reaction.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.917
Sales on my new line
are tanking.

04:30.952 --> 04:32.051
All right,
I'll take care of it.

04:32.052 --> 04:33.999
Where is she based?
New York or Miami?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.208
- Cleveland.
- I'm sorry?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.009
She's not your typical model,
Harvey.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.844
She's a digital influencer.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.579
All right, well,
who is she managed by?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.548
Her mother, last I checked.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.817
Joan, how old is this person?

04:45.852 --> 04:46.617
16.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.730
Then,
with all due respect,

04:47.754 --> 04:50.354
send her a gift basket
and be done with it.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.657
Harvey, you don't get it.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.792
This girl has
50 million followers.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.761
We need to sue her
into the ground before

04:56.796 --> 04:58.238
she tanks my whole company.

04:58.239 --> 05:00.257
We also need to be
conscious of your image,

05:00.258 --> 05:03.126
and suing a 16-year-old
isn't a pretty picture.

05:03.161 --> 05:04.939
It's not the picture
I'm worried about, Harvey.

05:04.963 --> 05:06.863
It's that video.

05:06.898 --> 05:09.432
So are you going to find
a way to get it down,

05:09.468 --> 05:11.632
or do I need to find
another firm who can?

Good morning, Donna.

05:47.842 --> 05:49.405
Samantha.

05:49.406 --> 05:50.450
What can I do for you today?

05:50.474 --> 05:51.239
Actually,
I thought there might be

05:51.275 --> 05:52.445
something I can do for you.

05:52.446 --> 05:53.967
I heard you're looking
for representation

05:53.968 --> 05:55.701
for your charity.

05:55.737 --> 05:57.804
Oh, that's nice
of you to offer,

05:57.839 --> 06:00.473
but I know how much
Robert leans on you,

06:00.508 --> 06:01.552
and I don't think
he's gonna be okay

06:01.576 --> 06:04.343
with me doing it
if it means you doing it.

06:04.379 --> 06:06.190
Why do I get the feeling
that even if you would be

06:06.214 --> 06:07.780
okay with me doing this
you aren't?

06:07.816 --> 06:09.615
Okay.
Do you want the truth?

06:11.319 --> 06:13.030
I don't think
you're the person for this.

06:13.031 --> 06:14.731
Because you still
don't trust me.

06:14.766 --> 06:16.399
Because you haven't
shown me I can.

06:17.402 --> 06:18.434
Okay, have it your way.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.570
I'm sure Alex
will knock it out of the park.

06:20.605 --> 06:22.272
Oh wait,
he's too busy.

06:22.307 --> 06:24.267
You could always try
one of those junior partners.

06:24.311 --> 06:25.488
Of course, they're all
too afraid of Robert

06:25.512 --> 06:27.512
to spend billable
hours on a pro Bono.

06:27.548 --> 06:28.725
- Are you done?
- I don't know. Am I?

06:28.749 --> 06:30.627
Not until you tell me why
you want this so much.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.128
Well, if I told you
it's because I care

06:32.152 --> 06:34.330
about the work this charity
does you'd never believe me.

06:34.354 --> 06:35.820
So why don't we just say
it's because

06:35.856 --> 06:37.789
a little birdie asked me to.

06:37.824 --> 06:39.824
Okay, Samantha.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.593
I'll send you their files.

06:46.856 --> 06:48.555
Brian, there you are.

06:48.591 --> 06:49.768
I need your help
with something.

06:49.792 --> 06:50.557
Sure, what is it?

06:50.593 --> 06:51.458
Emmet Ford hit a roadblock

06:51.494 --> 06:53.437
getting listed on
the stock exchange

06:53.438 --> 06:55.572
and we need to blow
that roadblock away.

06:55.607 --> 06:56.684
Whoa, whoa, Katrina,
whatever this is,

06:56.708 --> 06:57.676
you can handle this yourself.

06:57.676 --> 06:58.632
Why are you coming
to me with it?

06:58.633 --> 07:00.520
Three reasons.
One, you have more

07:00.521 --> 07:02.354
stock exchange experience
than I do.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.456
Two, I want a show of force.
And three?

07:04.492 --> 07:06.292
Let's just say
Donna once said

07:06.327 --> 07:07.927
that you make everyone
around you better.

07:07.962 --> 07:11.597
And I need to be
at my best on this case.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.399
- Then I accept.
- Then read up.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.934
We're meeting them in an hour.

07:22.095 --> 07:24.028
Donna, just the person
I was about to come see.

07:24.063 --> 07:25.743
- Oh, is that a fact?
- You seem perturbed.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.959
I am.
Because Samantha just asked

07:27.960 --> 07:29.505
to represent my charity
and there's no way

07:29.529 --> 07:31.028
she would have done that
if she hadn't

07:31.063 --> 07:33.831
heard about it from you.
Donna,

07:33.866 --> 07:34.799
you two got off on
the wrong foot,

07:34.834 --> 07:36.700
and I know for a fact
she wants to fix it.

07:36.736 --> 07:37.635
And how do you know that?

07:37.670 --> 07:38.847
Because when
I came to her with this

07:38.871 --> 07:40.115
She said it'll kill two birds
with one stone,

07:40.139 --> 07:42.332
and one of those birds
was making good with you.

07:42.333 --> 07:46.377
Well, I still wish
you hadn't gone to her at all.

07:47.078 --> 07:48.838
Does that mean
I should tear up this check?

07:53.151 --> 07:55.652
This is a donation
for $5 million.

07:55.687 --> 07:56.697
That Samantha insisted I get

07:56.721 --> 07:59.022
before she took on
your charity.

07:59.057 --> 08:01.791
Donna,
she's serious about this.

08:03.361 --> 08:05.361
Okay, Alex,
I'll give her a chance.

08:06.598 --> 08:08.464
Thank you for this check.

08:14.119 --> 08:17.020
Mr. Ford,
I'm Katrina Bennett.

08:17.055 --> 08:18.677
This is Brian Altman.
It's nice to meet you both.

08:18.678 --> 08:19.955
We've read up on
your situation,

08:19.979 --> 08:22.613
but we want to hear it
directly from you.

08:22.648 --> 08:24.715
Okay, here it is.

08:24.751 --> 08:27.518
I've spent the last six months

08:27.553 --> 08:29.687
trying to drum up interest
in our IPO.

08:30.049 --> 08:31.249
And then at the eleventh hour,

08:31.284 --> 08:33.884
the stock exchange
pulls a rug out from under me.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.753
- Why would they do that?
- Ask Marc Aiken.

08:35.788 --> 08:37.121
The Chairman of the board?

08:37.155 --> 08:38.255
Yeah.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.124
The jackass has
had it in for me

08:40.159 --> 08:42.393
ever since we worked together
at Goldman.

08:42.428 --> 08:43.572
The board said
they pulled support

08:43.596 --> 08:46.209
because of concern over
our site's content,

08:46.210 --> 08:48.177
but I know damn well...

08:48.212 --> 08:49.990
It's just a pretext
for Marc to screw you over.

08:50.014 --> 08:51.046
Exactly.

08:51.082 --> 08:53.248
If I don't get
this infusion of capital,

08:53.284 --> 08:54.645
I am dead in the water.

08:54.646 --> 08:55.842
Then all we need
to do is show

08:55.843 --> 08:57.586
this is bad faith
and you're in.

08:57.587 --> 08:58.631
And that shouldn't
be too hard.

08:58.655 --> 09:00.249
All we need
are those board minutes.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.368
I tried that myself already;
they're sealed.

09:02.369 --> 09:04.403
- Then we need to unseal them.
- How?

09:04.438 --> 09:05.571
By getting it on record

09:05.606 --> 09:07.906
that Marc Aiken
hates your guts.

09:09.176 --> 09:11.043
All right,
I understand we're here

09:11.078 --> 09:12.377
because of a few blackheads.

09:12.413 --> 09:15.013
So what's it gonna take
to get that video down?

09:15.049 --> 09:18.083
My client's complexion
is her livelihood, Mr. Specter.

09:18.118 --> 09:20.485
Not only did this incident
harm her brand,

09:20.521 --> 09:22.721
it brought her
emotional anguish.

09:22.756 --> 09:26.291
It was so bad I couldn't post
a video for a week.

09:26.617 --> 09:28.204
Except the one defaming
my client.

09:28.205 --> 09:31.573
Well, I had to show people
what it did to my face.

09:31.609 --> 09:33.342
It was shaming.

09:33.377 --> 09:35.477
Which is why in addition
to the video staying up

09:35.513 --> 09:37.212
we've prepared this.

09:40.851 --> 09:41.950
Listen to me,

09:41.986 --> 09:45.120
if every 16-year-old girl
filed suit every time

09:45.155 --> 09:47.222
she wasn't happy with
what she saw in the mirror,

09:47.258 --> 09:49.892
our legal system would
grind to a halt.

09:49.927 --> 09:53.128
I'm not every
16-year-old girl, Mr. Specter.

09:53.163 --> 09:56.064
And you want me to take down
that video and not file this?

09:56.100 --> 09:58.433
I want $10 million.
I see.

09:58.469 --> 10:01.370
So this is a shakedown?
This is a legitimate claim,

10:01.405 --> 10:02.938
and your wisest
course of action

10:02.973 --> 10:04.373
would be to write that check.

10:04.785 --> 10:05.929
My course of action
is gonna be

10:05.953 --> 10:07.886
to hit you with
a defamation suit

10:07.922 --> 10:09.139
because you have no proof

10:09.140 --> 10:10.701
our product caused
your break outs.

10:10.702 --> 10:12.127
And I don't think
you understand

10:12.128 --> 10:13.626
that I have
50 million followers

10:13.627 --> 10:15.005
who will do anything
I tell them to.

10:15.029 --> 10:16.864
So even if that video
comes down,

10:16.865 --> 10:20.429
I can tell them not
to use your client anyway.

10:20.430 --> 10:22.230
That's it.
I don't care how old you are.

10:22.265 --> 10:23.932
You know what you're doing.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.278
You deserve
what's coming for you,

10:25.302 --> 10:27.769
and this meeting's over.

10:33.731 --> 10:36.195
- Okay, Harvey.
- Okay, what?

10:36.196 --> 10:38.630
Okay.
Why don't you make your jokes

10:38.665 --> 10:40.000
about me and Sheila
procreating so we can get

10:40.001 --> 10:41.312
to you filling me in
on Joan's emergency.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.796
I don't need to fill you in,
Louis.

10:42.797 --> 10:45.106
I got it from here.
No, you don't have anything.

10:45.107 --> 10:46.485
You were just supposed
to babysit her.

10:46.509 --> 10:48.689
That's the thing about
actually being at work, Louis.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.184
Situations change
and you make adjustments.

10:51.185 --> 10:53.778
This isn't a situation.
This is you taking my client.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.568
And you were the one okay
with clients leaving

10:55.569 --> 10:56.589
if that's what they wanted.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.923
So that's what this is about.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.659
Your mad because I let Dominic
do what was best for him.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.694
No, this is about
you left the office

11:02.730 --> 11:04.363
to get
your girlfriend knocked up.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.431
I started working a case,
and I'm gonna finish it.

11:06.467 --> 11:07.544
Don't you bring
Sheila into this.

11:07.568 --> 11:10.369
I didn't, Louis.
You did.

11:10.613 --> 11:12.054
Now, you listen to me closely

11:12.055 --> 11:13.374
'cause I'm not
gonna say this again.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.675
Your services are no longer
needed on this case.

11:18.213 --> 11:21.214
Mr. Aiken, exactly how do you
feel about Emmet Ford?

11:21.249 --> 11:23.116
- Ambivalent.
- Ambivalent?

11:23.151 --> 11:24.609
You worked together
for seven years.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.776
Asked and answered.
Where is this going?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.512
It's going to the fact
that your client

11:28.547 --> 11:29.747
deliberately tried to sabotage

11:29.781 --> 11:32.783
Emmet Ford's IPO
because he doesn't like him.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.117
That's bullshit.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.592
Really,
then why did you punch him?

11:35.620 --> 11:36.886
- What?
- Why would you throw

11:36.922 --> 11:38.621
a punch at someone
if you like them?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.990
I didn't say I like him,
and that incident

11:41.026 --> 11:42.926
happened on
the trading floor at Goldman.

11:42.961 --> 11:45.295
Throwing punches
was considered friendly.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.607
I got to tell you, Marc,
it doesn't sound friendly.

11:46.631 --> 11:47.530
I don't care
what it sounds like.

11:47.566 --> 11:48.998
Then let me tell you
how it looks.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.466
You had a fight;
you held a grudge;

11:50.502 --> 11:51.367
and when you got
the chance to screw over

11:51.403 --> 11:52.702
a man you hate,
you took it.

11:52.737 --> 11:53.937
I didn't screw him over.

11:53.972 --> 11:55.505
But you do hate him,
don't you?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.607
Okay, you know what?
I can't stand him.

11:57.642 --> 11:59.409
I think he's a sanctimonious
son of a bitch

11:59.444 --> 12:01.644
and if I never seem him again,
it'll be too soon,

12:01.680 --> 12:04.581
but I did not
keep him off that exchange.

12:06.284 --> 12:08.124
Then if you're not going
to tell us the truth

12:08.153 --> 12:10.286
about that,
the board minutes will.

12:10.322 --> 12:12.316
You have no right
to those minutes.

12:12.317 --> 12:14.390
We do, now that he's
admitted personal bias.

12:15.076 --> 12:16.842
So either we can subpoena
those minutes

12:16.877 --> 12:18.978
and show this tape
in open court,

12:19.013 --> 12:20.613
or you can turn them
over today.

12:20.648 --> 12:21.947
But you better decide fast

12:21.983 --> 12:24.617
because I've already drafted
that subpoena.

12:28.389 --> 12:30.322
You'll have them
by the end of the day.

12:34.404 --> 12:35.937
And then I said,
"It's not the same."

12:35.972 --> 12:37.450
And then he said,
"Well, you're the one

12:37.474 --> 12:38.584
who's okay with clients
with leaving."

12:38.608 --> 12:40.942
And then he brought up Sheila,
and then I got really mad,

12:40.977 --> 12:42.488
and then I got really sad
and called you.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.512
Now fix it.

12:43.547 --> 12:46.614
Louis, customarily
I find your frustrations

12:46.650 --> 12:49.217
with Harvey to be entirely
of your own making,

12:49.252 --> 12:51.219
but in this instance,

12:51.254 --> 12:53.922
it sounds like Harvey
may be the one in the wrong.

12:53.957 --> 12:55.323
Holy shit,
I need to go out

12:55.358 --> 12:56.291
and buy a lotto ticket
right now.

12:56.326 --> 12:59.127
Louis,
stay with me.

12:59.162 --> 13:00.915
You two have known each other
a long time.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.616
You've had your ups and downs.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.918
Yeah, I know, it's like
we're almost in a relationship.

13:04.954 --> 13:08.455
Not almost,
it is a relationship.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.857
Oh, my God.

13:09.892 --> 13:12.492
I'm in a relationship
with Harvey.

13:12.528 --> 13:13.560
Can I be the boy?

13:13.596 --> 13:15.040
Oh, scratch that,
I don't even give a shit.

13:15.064 --> 13:16.697
I'm in a relationship
with Harvey.

13:16.732 --> 13:18.832
And would you like to work
on that relationship?

13:18.868 --> 13:20.634
Or spend the rest
of the session

13:20.669 --> 13:21.568
celebrating its existence.

13:21.604 --> 13:23.215
I think we both know
the answer to that,

13:23.239 --> 13:24.316
but I'll settle
for working on it.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.273
In that case...

13:26.308 --> 13:28.242
what would Harvey say

13:28.277 --> 13:31.211
if you were to ask
him why he is so upset?

13:31.247 --> 13:32.646
I don't know.
He's Harvey.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.580
He'd say, "I'm right.
You're wrong."

13:33.616 --> 13:35.949
Touch his hair and leave.
Louis.

13:35.985 --> 13:37.425
If you cannot see him
as human being,

13:37.453 --> 13:39.586
I cannot help you.

13:41.285 --> 13:43.685
- What if I brought him in?
- Excuse me?

13:43.721 --> 13:44.887
You do couple's counseling.

13:44.922 --> 13:46.833
What if I brought him in
to work on our relationship?

13:46.857 --> 13:48.557
That is not exactly
what I meant...

13:48.592 --> 13:50.759
- You just said we're a couple.
- I didn't say that.

13:50.794 --> 13:52.594
Well, then what did you say?

13:52.630 --> 13:53.673
Because I don't know
what he's feeling,

13:53.697 --> 13:55.497
but I do know
that we need help.

13:58.135 --> 13:59.968
Okay, Louis.

14:00.704 --> 14:04.006
If you can bring him in,
I'll help.

14:11.782 --> 14:13.549
Did you finish reading
the minutes?

14:13.584 --> 14:15.284
Yes. I read them twice

14:15.319 --> 14:16.959
to make sure
I wasn't missing anything.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.993
Well, you didn't.
All these show

14:19.029 --> 14:21.007
is hours of Aiken lobbying
to keep Emmet's business

14:21.031 --> 14:22.141
and everyone else lobbying
against him.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.898
I know. He set us up.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.933
So we'd spend half
the day wasting our time

14:25.969 --> 14:27.935
while the clock on
that IPO is ticking.

14:27.971 --> 14:29.804
Now I have to stay here
all night because

14:29.839 --> 14:32.507
we're running out of time,
and I'm not losing this case.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.909
Then I just have
one question.

14:34.944 --> 14:36.611
Indian or Chinese?

14:36.646 --> 14:39.280
Because if you're staying here
all night, I am too.

14:39.315 --> 14:41.416
Indian.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.451
Thanks, Brian.

14:44.254 --> 14:45.753
Don't you look nice.

14:45.789 --> 14:48.123
We doing costume changes in
the middle of the day now?

14:48.124 --> 14:49.424
Okay, first of all,
it is not

14:49.459 --> 14:50.992
the middle of the day,
and, second,

14:51.027 --> 14:52.593
I'm going to a gala
for the charity

14:52.629 --> 14:54.195
that you said
you didn't have time for.

14:54.230 --> 14:55.741
Well, if I'd known you
were gonna dress like that,

14:55.765 --> 14:56.731
I'd have made time.

14:56.766 --> 14:58.666
And if had known
that a married man

14:58.701 --> 14:59.712
was going to hit on me
at work, I would have

14:59.736 --> 15:00.935
served him with papers.

15:00.970 --> 15:03.404
Come on, baby,
don't be like that.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.607
Seriously, Donna, I'm glad it
worked out with Samantha.

15:06.643 --> 15:08.309
Thanks, Alex.

15:08.344 --> 15:10.311
I'm glad it did too.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.161
Brian, I don't know
where you found this place,

15:19.185 --> 15:23.688
but this is the best masala
I've had since college.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.718
I just realized
this is, like, our third dinner

15:25.719 --> 15:27.272
we've had together,
and I don't even know

15:27.273 --> 15:28.806
where you went to college.

15:28.841 --> 15:30.452
Well, if you must know,
I went to Princeton,

15:30.476 --> 15:32.554
but before you can ask about
my major, I couldn't Dec...

15:32.578 --> 15:33.911
Holy shit, Princeton.

15:33.946 --> 15:34.712
Brian, it's not
that big a deal.

15:34.747 --> 15:36.158
Everybody here went
to Harvard Law...

15:36.182 --> 15:37.882
I'm not talking about that.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.695
I'm talking about Tony Gold.
Who's Tony Gold?

15:39.719 --> 15:42.119
He was my rival on
the debate team in high school.

15:42.155 --> 15:43.355
He knew Princeton was my dream

15:43.389 --> 15:45.289
and that my parents couldn't
afford to send me

15:45.325 --> 15:46.757
to the interview in person.

15:46.793 --> 15:48.070
So Tony offered
to let me ride up

15:48.094 --> 15:49.694
with his family
as an olive branch.

15:49.729 --> 15:51.206
- How'd the interview go?
- He never picked me up.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.497
Princeton thought I'd bailed;
he got in; I didn't.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.032
Brian, that's horrible.

15:55.068 --> 15:57.168
It is, but Tony came up
with a bullshit story

15:57.203 --> 15:59.704
about why they never showed,
and I believed him.

15:59.739 --> 16:01.605
Until his little brother
told me the truth

16:01.641 --> 16:02.840
a few months later.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.542
What are you saying?

16:04.577 --> 16:05.988
I'm saying Tony couldn't
keep it to himself.

16:06.012 --> 16:07.556
Because when you do something
like that...

16:07.580 --> 16:08.512
You have to tell someone.

16:08.548 --> 16:10.681
Which means all we need
to do is find

16:10.717 --> 16:12.650
Marc Aiken's little brother.

16:16.122 --> 16:18.522
You got a little masala
on your...

16:19.325 --> 16:21.325
Other side.

16:22.261 --> 16:23.994
Your... here.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.796
Let me get it.

16:27.734 --> 16:30.101
What?

16:30.862 --> 16:32.106
I just made it
1,000 times worse.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.463
You look like Ronald McDonald.

16:33.498 --> 16:35.865
I thought you do this with
your son, like, every day.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.867
Well, I haven't had
to do it with him in months

16:37.902 --> 16:41.704
because his food is the train,
and he keeps it in the station.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.840
- Ha ha, give me that napkin.
- No.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.115
Not till after
I take a picture.

16:45.143 --> 16:46.843
No, you are not taking
a picture of me.

16:46.878 --> 16:48.122
Well, maybe you should
have thought of that

16:48.146 --> 16:50.513
before you let me wipe sauce
all over your face.

16:51.049 --> 16:52.882
All right, I'll get it off.

16:58.723 --> 17:01.557
I don't think we should eat
anymore masala.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.467
Donna, I cannot thank you
enough for your donation.

17:11.502 --> 17:12.913
You're already making such
a difference.

17:12.936 --> 17:14.315
Oh, please, Peggy,
you're the ones

17:14.339 --> 17:15.415
making the real difference.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.540
I'm just happy
I could help you do it.

17:20.078 --> 17:21.288
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

17:21.311 --> 17:22.377
Sure.

17:25.698 --> 17:27.263
- Samantha.
- Donna.

17:27.299 --> 17:29.144
I have to say I didn't expect
to see you here.

17:29.168 --> 17:30.934
I didn't expect to be here.

17:30.969 --> 17:33.214
Did you come to show me how
good you look all dressed up?

17:33.238 --> 17:36.039
What if I came to see how
good you look all dressed up?

17:36.075 --> 17:37.619
Miss Wheeler,
are you flirting with me?

17:37.643 --> 17:39.509
And how would
that make you feel if I was?

17:39.545 --> 17:41.611
Are you kidding?
I went to theater camp.

17:41.647 --> 17:42.746
Hm.

17:42.781 --> 17:45.282
But I would still like
to know why you're here.

17:45.317 --> 17:46.961
I mean, you don't strike me
as the kind of person

17:46.985 --> 17:49.504
who would come to an event like
this unless she had to.

17:49.505 --> 17:51.138
I wouldn't,
but if I'm gonna represent

17:51.173 --> 17:52.306
these people,
I need to know

17:52.341 --> 17:53.774
what they do
and how they do it.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.220
While we're on
the subject of working,

17:55.244 --> 17:57.244
I got that check from Alex.

17:57.279 --> 17:58.990
Is that your way of saying
you're good with me doing this?

17:59.014 --> 18:01.582
It is, but it's not just
because of the money.

18:01.617 --> 18:03.050
You're here showing interest.

18:03.085 --> 18:04.529
That's just the kind
of representation

18:04.553 --> 18:06.120
this place needs.

18:06.155 --> 18:08.755
Well, in that case, maybe
we should hit up the food.

18:08.791 --> 18:10.624
I may not have come
for the shrimp cocktail,

18:10.659 --> 18:13.260
but I'm gonna eat the shit
out of some.

18:13.295 --> 18:14.828
I've already had
16 oysters myself.

18:14.864 --> 18:17.664
17th won't hurt anybody.

18:22.797 --> 18:23.836
I don't know about you,

18:23.837 --> 18:26.652
but not all the cocktails I
had last night were shrimp.

18:27.835 --> 18:29.635
Thank you, Donna.
You didn't have to.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.204
Just like you didn't have
to take on this charity.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.440
But I got the impression
from Alex that he saw

18:34.475 --> 18:35.486
a side of you that I hadn't,

18:35.510 --> 18:38.844
and last night I think
I started to see it too.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.080
Well, as long as
we're talking about last night,

18:41.115 --> 18:42.782
I may have found
something wrong.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.183
What do you mean?

18:44.218 --> 18:46.685
I mean, charities typically
spend 5% of their budget

18:46.721 --> 18:48.821
on fundraising,
but based on the disclosures

18:48.856 --> 18:50.034
I got from your friend, Peggy,

18:50.058 --> 18:53.826
they've been at 5.3%
for the last five years.

18:54.410 --> 18:55.943
Sound like
a simple rounding error.

18:55.979 --> 18:57.011
Donna.

18:57.046 --> 18:58.324
I have a nose for
this kind of thing,

18:58.348 --> 19:01.282
and I think Peggy
is up to something shady.

19:01.317 --> 19:02.728
And the problem
with people who fix things

19:02.752 --> 19:05.889
is they can't stop looking
for problems to fix.

19:05.890 --> 19:06.967
You think I'm making this up?

19:06.991 --> 19:09.425
I think you're making .3%
into more than it is.

19:09.460 --> 19:10.738
And I think the devil
is in the details,

19:10.762 --> 19:13.896
and I am telling you
this detail is trouble.

19:14.399 --> 19:15.564
Okay.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.588
If you're so sure,
I'll talk to Peggy.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.633
Maybe I should be the one...

19:18.657 --> 19:19.522
Samantha,
if my friend has been

19:19.558 --> 19:22.592
lying to me,
I'm not gonna ignore it.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.527
I'm gonna turn on
my spidey senses,

19:24.563 --> 19:26.129
and I'm gonna find out
if you're right,

19:26.164 --> 19:27.264
and what I want you to do

19:27.299 --> 19:30.066
is not try to fix
this in the meantime.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.802
Okay.
Let me know what you find.

19:40.915 --> 19:42.882
Harvey,
we need to talk

19:42.917 --> 19:44.550
because our relationship
needs tending.

19:44.586 --> 19:46.336
Our what needs what?

19:46.337 --> 19:47.069
You heard me.
We're in a relationship,

19:47.104 --> 19:48.270
and it's not working.

19:48.305 --> 19:49.538
Then break up with me

19:49.573 --> 19:50.996
and go out with somebody else
'cause I'm busy.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.208
Harvey, I am serious.
We're partners.

19:53.244 --> 19:54.555
We need to work on
our relationship,

19:54.556 --> 19:55.822
and we need help doing it.

19:55.857 --> 19:56.936
Louis, what exactly
are you getting at?

19:56.937 --> 19:58.485
- Dr. Lipschitz.
- Your therapist?

19:58.486 --> 19:59.563
- Yeah, and he agreed...
- No.

19:59.587 --> 20:00.908
- But...
- Louis, there's no way

20:00.909 --> 20:03.076
I'm going to a session
with your therapist.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.354
Actually it would be
for the both of us.

20:04.378 --> 20:05.344
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:05.379 --> 20:06.744
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

20:06.745 --> 20:07.989
Well,
he thinks it's a good idea.

20:08.013 --> 20:11.047
Which just goes to show
that he's an idiot,

20:11.082 --> 20:12.527
and so are you.
Don't turn this on me

20:12.551 --> 20:13.795
and don't talk about him
that way.

20:13.819 --> 20:15.118
What's going on here?

20:15.153 --> 20:17.520
Harvey won't go to
couple's counseling with me.

20:17.556 --> 20:18.455
- What?
- Exactly.

20:18.490 --> 20:19.789
No, not exactly.

20:19.825 --> 20:22.492
Because you took my client;
you're upset about Dominic;

20:22.527 --> 20:24.828
you insulted me, my therapist,
and the woman I love.

20:24.863 --> 20:25.695
And none of that
would have happened

20:25.730 --> 20:26.596
if you put the needs
of this firm

20:26.631 --> 20:28.498
over your afternoon delight.

20:28.533 --> 20:29.866
And here we go again.

20:29.901 --> 20:31.434
Louis,
will you give us a minute?

20:35.707 --> 20:37.480
Donna, I don't want
to talk about this.

20:37.481 --> 20:39.081
Too bad,
because I heard the way

20:39.116 --> 20:40.880
you spoke to Louis before
and just now,

20:40.881 --> 20:42.781
and there's clearly
stuff going on with you

20:42.816 --> 20:43.982
that you're not dealing with.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.061
Probably has something
to do with

20:45.085 --> 20:46.262
what you just went through
with Marcus.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.636
This has nothing to do
with him getting a divorce.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.323
He's what?

20:50.358 --> 20:51.524
He called.

20:51.559 --> 20:53.352
They're not gonna try
to work it out.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.284
Well, I don't care
if you go see Lipschitz

20:56.319 --> 20:58.386
or someone else, but you need
to deal with yourself.

20:58.422 --> 21:00.221
And stop treating Louis
like you used to

21:00.257 --> 21:02.190
because he's not
that man anymore.

21:02.225 --> 21:03.958
And I thought you were neither.

21:09.247 --> 21:12.782
- Okay, thanks for your time.
- Anything?

21:12.817 --> 21:13.749
Nothing.

21:13.785 --> 21:15.851
That was the 15th person
I've called

21:15.887 --> 21:17.620
that knows Marc Aiken,
and no one says

21:17.655 --> 21:19.355
they're anything more
than an acquaintance.

21:19.390 --> 21:20.667
That tracks with
what Emmet told me.

21:20.691 --> 21:22.625
The man has no friends,
no family,

21:22.660 --> 21:24.650
just a bunch of associates
who can barely stand him.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.929
The guy I just talked to
said he's got

21:25.953 --> 21:27.652
a standing tee time
at Quaker Ridge

21:27.688 --> 21:29.554
for the sole purpose of
advancing his career.

21:29.590 --> 21:30.622
I bet it works.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.657
My father would tolerate
anyone to play there.

21:32.693 --> 21:35.293
- Your dad's a golfer?
- Yeah. I am too, actually.

21:35.329 --> 21:36.828
Huh, I had no idea.

21:36.864 --> 21:39.164
Well, I don't get to play
as much as I'd like.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.167
Wait a second.
What?

21:42.202 --> 21:43.568
If he has
a standing tee time,

21:43.604 --> 21:45.137
he has a standing caddy.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.139
And a caddy might not
be someone he confides in,

21:47.174 --> 21:49.040
but if all he ever talks
about is business...

21:49.076 --> 21:50.253
We need to get
to Quaker Ridge.

21:50.277 --> 21:51.943
Let's go.
You go.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.156
We're running out of time,
and if you get something,

21:53.180 --> 21:55.981
we're going to need a complaint
ready to file with the SCC.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:04.616 --> 22:06.094
Oh, Harvey,
if you are here to tell me

22:06.118 --> 22:07.595
that you think
another of my ideas is stupid...

22:07.619 --> 22:09.066
I'm not here
to tell you that, Louis.

22:09.067 --> 22:12.769
I'm here to say I'll go see
Lipschitz with you.

22:12.804 --> 22:14.582
Do you really mean that,
or is this gonna be

22:14.606 --> 22:16.083
like the time that you said
you would take me to dinner

22:16.107 --> 22:17.974
for my 35th birthday
,and you never showed up.

22:18.009 --> 22:19.876
It's not gonna be
like that time.

22:19.911 --> 22:22.612
- And what about the time...
- Not that time either.

22:22.647 --> 22:25.081
I'll show up for this.
I promise.

22:25.116 --> 22:26.560
And that's exactly what you
said the time...

22:26.584 --> 22:27.995
Louis, if you mention
one more time,

22:28.019 --> 22:30.086
it will be like
all those times.

22:30.789 --> 22:32.922
Then I want you to know
that I really appreciate

22:32.957 --> 22:34.557
you doing this, Harvey.
And to save time

22:34.592 --> 22:35.870
when we get there,
you should know that I sit

22:35.894 --> 22:37.627
on the left-hand side
of the couch.

22:37.662 --> 22:39.329
Fine.

22:39.364 --> 22:40.474
And I probably don't need
to tell you this,

22:40.498 --> 22:42.265
but you don't have
to bring your own tissues.

22:42.804 --> 22:44.370
Why would I bring
my own tissues?

22:44.406 --> 22:46.350
Because we're gonna be doing
some deep work, Harvey.

22:46.374 --> 22:47.941
So if you need to have
a good cry,

22:47.976 --> 22:49.086
I just want you to know
that you're safe,

22:49.110 --> 22:50.944
and I will not judge you.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.586
See you there, Louis.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.639
Wait, do you think
we should hug now

22:53.640 --> 22:54.606
to set the tone
or do it after...

22:54.641 --> 22:57.475
okay, we'll do it after.
Good call.

23:04.985 --> 23:05.917
Hey, what are you doing?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.986
Don't act like
you don't know, Donna.

23:08.021 --> 23:09.120
I've been fired.

23:09.156 --> 23:10.388
What? How could I know that?

23:10.424 --> 23:12.323
Because it happened after
Samantha Wheeler

23:12.359 --> 23:14.359
called my CEO and put
a stop payment on that check.

23:15.262 --> 23:17.162
Peggy, you have got
to believe me.

23:17.197 --> 23:19.831
I had nothing to do with that.
What difference does it make?

23:19.866 --> 23:22.100
My boss blamed me for
getting us involved with you,

23:22.135 --> 23:24.102
and he fired me.
That's bullshit.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.970
What's bullshit
is that I trusted you.

23:26.006 --> 23:26.805
And now I'm out on my ass.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.640
You can still trust me,
Peggy.

23:30.043 --> 23:31.943
I swear I'm gonna
make this right.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.381
What the hell
is wrong with you?

23:36.416 --> 23:37.816
Donna...

23:37.851 --> 23:39.562
I specifically told you
not to do anything

23:39.586 --> 23:40.630
until you heard from me,
and you said you wouldn't.

23:40.654 --> 23:42.520
I said I'd let you
talk to Peggy, and I did.

23:42.556 --> 23:44.289
After you called up her boss,

23:44.324 --> 23:46.817
put a stop payment on
that check, and got her fired.

23:46.818 --> 23:48.329
I didn't call her boss
to get her fired.

23:48.353 --> 23:50.739
I called because I decided
to trust your judgment.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.712
What is that
supposed to mean?

23:51.713 --> 23:53.555
It means I asked myself,
"What if Donna's right?"

23:53.556 --> 23:55.324
What if the only thing
going on is some vendors

23:55.325 --> 23:56.502
taking advantage of a charity.

23:56.526 --> 23:59.649
So I called up the CEO
and offered a solution.

23:59.650 --> 24:03.084
And he said, "No, thanks,
we like our current situation."

24:03.120 --> 24:05.420
So you ran a stress test
after I told you not to.

24:05.456 --> 24:07.155
I called a client
and made a suggestion.

24:07.191 --> 24:10.125
- Don't bullshit me.
- Okay, fine.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.693
It was a test,

24:11.728 --> 24:14.930
but I'm not gonna let
a client donate $5 million

24:14.965 --> 24:16.619
to anyone without knowing
what's what.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.186
So I killed two birds
with one stone.

24:18.222 --> 24:19.532
Which is exactly
what you said to Alex

24:19.556 --> 24:21.289
and making good with me
was supposed to be

24:21.325 --> 24:22.257
one of those birds.

24:22.292 --> 24:23.525
God damn it, Donna,

24:23.560 --> 24:25.360
why don't you ever seem
to believe me?

24:25.395 --> 24:27.207
Maybe because you never
give anyone the full story.

24:27.231 --> 24:28.496
You want the full story?

24:28.532 --> 24:31.633
They are stealing money
from little girls.

24:31.668 --> 24:32.879
Maybe that doesn't
matter to you,

24:32.903 --> 24:34.369
but it sure as hell
as matters to me.

24:34.404 --> 24:37.505
You don't know
what matters to me.

24:37.541 --> 24:39.074
And there are about
500 different ways

24:39.109 --> 24:40.820
you could have handled this,
and you picked the one

24:40.844 --> 24:42.444
that cost me my friend.

24:42.479 --> 24:44.045
So as far as I'm concerned,

24:44.081 --> 24:46.081
I was right about you
all along.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.231
Now that we've made
our introductions,

24:54.854 --> 24:56.796
I'd like to start with Harvey

24:56.797 --> 24:58.230
describing what he thinks

24:58.266 --> 25:00.566
Louis' perspective
is on the situation.

25:00.601 --> 25:01.834
I don't feel comfortable...

25:01.869 --> 25:04.670
Please, just say the first
thoughts that come to mind.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.639
About how Louis thinks?

25:06.674 --> 25:09.708
Huh.
Let's see...

25:09.744 --> 25:12.545
Cats, ballet, Harvey Specter.
Something like that.

25:12.580 --> 25:13.624
That is not
what I sound like.

25:13.648 --> 25:14.680
All right, Louis.

25:14.715 --> 25:17.783
You wanna know
what you sound like to me?

25:18.314 --> 25:21.849
"I've been jealous
of you since day one.

25:21.885 --> 25:24.886
"You were always Jessica's
favorite and everyone else's.

25:24.921 --> 25:27.789
"You got everything I wanted
without ever trying.

25:27.824 --> 25:28.901
"In fact,
I'm trying to have a baby

25:28.925 --> 25:32.660
"because, I-I-I think it will
take my mind off you

25:32.696 --> 25:35.902
even though I know
deep inside it won't."

25:36.026 --> 25:37.225
Tell him to stop.

25:37.260 --> 25:38.571
He's being honest about
his feelings, Louis.

25:38.572 --> 25:39.683
What about
your feelings about

25:39.707 --> 25:40.759
who's fault
this whole thing was?

25:40.760 --> 25:41.626
- Louis.
- What?

25:41.661 --> 25:42.705
I should have known
you just wanted

25:42.729 --> 25:45.663
to get me in here

25:45.699 --> 25:47.109
to have him tell me
this is my fault.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.232
It is your fault.

25:48.268 --> 25:49.378
Louis, we are not here
to discuss fault.

25:49.402 --> 25:50.780
Well,
then why the hell are we here?

25:50.804 --> 25:52.754
Because he took my client;
he won't give her back;

25:52.755 --> 25:54.615
and he needs to apologize
about what he just said

25:54.616 --> 25:55.480
about me having a baby.

25:55.481 --> 25:58.180
I am not apologizing
about anything.

25:58.216 --> 25:59.482
You wanted me to come here.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.317
You said this was a safe place.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.985
And now you can't handle

26:03.021 --> 26:04.565
what I think about
you trying to have a baby.

26:04.589 --> 26:05.599
Oh, no, you don't get
to make this my fault.

26:05.623 --> 26:07.223
Because it's always my fault,

26:07.258 --> 26:08.569
but I thought this time
we could come here

26:08.593 --> 26:10.426
so you could tell him
that it's his fault,

26:10.461 --> 26:11.994
but if all you're gonna do
is mock me

26:12.030 --> 26:13.796
and all you're gonna do
is coddle him,

26:13.831 --> 26:15.109
well, then you can keep
Joan Walsh;

26:15.133 --> 26:16.265
you can go to hell;

26:16.300 --> 26:18.100
and this whole session is over.

26:23.188 --> 26:25.088
Well,
this was a waste of time.

26:26.492 --> 26:29.526
Maybe so,
but for what it's worth...

26:30.763 --> 26:33.297
I think you have some things
you could work on.

26:33.332 --> 26:36.433
And provided Louis was okay...

26:36.468 --> 26:38.936
I'd be happy to talk
with you any time.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.993
Alex,

26:46.028 --> 26:47.305
I need you to reverse
that stop payment.

26:47.329 --> 26:48.762
What?

26:48.797 --> 26:50.408
I said I need you
to call up that client

26:50.432 --> 26:51.643
and tell them to let
that donation go through.

26:51.667 --> 26:52.633
Well, I'm not gonna do that

26:52.668 --> 26:54.434
because Samantha told me
what's going on.

26:54.470 --> 26:55.747
Samantha doesn't know
what's going on,

26:55.771 --> 26:57.437
and you were wrong
to involve her.

26:57.473 --> 26:58.783
- So this is about me.
- No, this is about the fact

26:58.807 --> 27:00.540
that my friend just got fired.

27:00.576 --> 27:02.187
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
Donna, but I can't help you.

27:02.211 --> 27:04.211
Then don't help me.
Help the charity.

27:04.246 --> 27:06.324
Because you're taking money
away from people who need it.

27:06.348 --> 27:08.081
Donna,
if I do what you're asking

27:08.117 --> 27:10.195
I might as well tell my clients
they can't trust my advice.

27:10.219 --> 27:12.030
And my advice to you
is get your head on straight.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.164
You're saying I'm not seeing
this clearly.

27:13.188 --> 27:15.522
I'm saying Samantha
specializes in shady shit.

27:15.557 --> 27:16.923
So if she suspects
something's up

27:16.959 --> 27:18.792
you might not believe it,
but I do.

27:18.827 --> 27:20.667
And I'm not cutting
that charity another check.

27:35.385 --> 27:38.119
- Almost done?
- Oh.

27:38.155 --> 27:40.321
Sorry, Katrina.
That's okay.

27:40.357 --> 27:42.068
I take it you were thinking
about something.

27:42.092 --> 27:43.258
To tell you the truth,

27:43.293 --> 27:45.193
I actually came in here
to think.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.439
But I've hogged
this thing long enough.

27:46.463 --> 27:48.363
It's all yours.

27:49.066 --> 27:50.209
As long as you're here,
do you mind

27:50.233 --> 27:51.566
if I ask you a question?

27:51.601 --> 27:53.068
Of course, what is it?

27:53.421 --> 27:54.557
Louis said if I win this case

27:54.558 --> 27:57.092
I'll finally make
senior partner, but...

27:57.128 --> 27:58.560
He's said that before,

27:58.596 --> 28:00.496
and you wanna know
if this time it's true?

28:00.531 --> 28:01.964
I do.

28:01.999 --> 28:04.133
Then the answer is yes.

28:04.168 --> 28:06.268
It is.

28:06.303 --> 28:08.037
Thanks, Donna.

28:10.408 --> 28:12.941
As long as you're here,

28:12.977 --> 28:15.144
do you mind
if I ask you something?

28:17.048 --> 28:19.148
What's going on with
you and Brian?

28:19.917 --> 28:20.783
What?

28:20.818 --> 28:22.618
I noticed when the two of you

28:22.653 --> 28:24.097
were working together
last night you seemed

28:24.121 --> 28:26.288
to have gotten...

28:26.721 --> 28:28.388
closer.

28:29.391 --> 28:32.092
We have.
We've become friends.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.160
Looks like you might be
becoming more than that.

28:34.196 --> 28:35.895
Donna, he's married.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.997
He has a son.
I would never do it.

28:38.033 --> 28:39.766
I know,
but I also know that the heart

28:39.801 --> 28:41.568
doesn't always listen
to what the brain says

28:41.603 --> 28:44.237
it would never do.

28:44.272 --> 28:46.139
Well,
you don't need to worry

28:46.174 --> 28:49.309
because I don't feel anything
for Brian except friendship.

28:50.445 --> 28:53.113
Then good luck with the case.

28:54.011 --> 28:55.677
Copier's all yours.

29:08.481 --> 29:09.642
So what do you want do now,
Stan?

29:09.643 --> 29:11.309
Tell me Drake the Snake
was my fault too?

29:11.344 --> 29:14.279
Louis, I know our session
didn't go as planned,

29:14.314 --> 29:17.415
but I do think there
is still some hope.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.784
So...

29:19.820 --> 29:20.885
<i>I'd like your blessing</i>

29:20.921 --> 29:23.221
<i>to begin seeing Harvey
one on one.</i>

29:23.256 --> 29:25.868
What? Are you fucking kidding me?
You're choosing his side again?

29:25.892 --> 29:27.845
I am not choosing his side,
Louis.

29:27.846 --> 29:29.512
I am trying to help
both of you.

29:29.547 --> 29:31.225
No, you're not,
because anyone who has a choice

29:31.249 --> 29:33.549
between Harvey and me
always chooses him.

29:33.585 --> 29:35.162
You know it's my biggest fear,
and you made it out

29:35.186 --> 29:36.586
like it was all my fault.

29:36.621 --> 29:38.288
No, I didn't,

29:38.323 --> 29:39.756
and I stand by my assessment.

29:39.791 --> 29:41.724
There are aspects
of this situation

29:41.760 --> 29:43.459
that are of Harvey's making.

29:43.495 --> 29:45.439
Well, then why didn't you say
that to him, Stan?

29:45.463 --> 29:48.231
<i>Because, Louis,
when someone is hurting,</i>

29:48.266 --> 29:50.767
<i>you don't throw stones
at them.</i>

29:50.802 --> 29:52.368
What do you mean
Harvey's hurting?

29:52.404 --> 29:55.838
I mean, people lash out
when they are in pain.

29:55.874 --> 29:59.090
He lashed out at you,
and if you care about

29:59.091 --> 30:03.327
your relationship with him,
you will let me do my job.

30:03.362 --> 30:05.173
What if I don't care about
my relationship with him,

30:05.197 --> 30:06.274
and I'd rather keep you
to myself?

30:06.298 --> 30:08.599
<i>Louis, I know
how much you care</i>

30:08.634 --> 30:10.501
<i>about Harvey
even when he hurts you.</i>

30:10.536 --> 30:14.972
That is something I have always
admired about you,

30:15.007 --> 30:18.342
and I do not think you should
take it lightly.

30:18.377 --> 30:19.843
All right,
he can see you,

30:19.879 --> 30:21.545
but he doesn't have
my blessing.

30:24.850 --> 30:27.284
Katrina, I talked
to Aiken's caddy.

30:27.963 --> 30:30.497
I tried every trick
in the book. He froze me out.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.310
We didn't just get
frozen out, Brian.

30:32.311 --> 30:33.177
They slapped us
with a countersuit

30:33.212 --> 30:35.312
for slandering Marc.
We just made it

30:35.347 --> 30:37.347
1,000 times worse.
Shit.

30:37.383 --> 30:40.451
- Look, maybe we can still...
- I can't fucking believe it!

30:43.456 --> 30:44.888
Katrina, it's just a case.

30:44.924 --> 30:46.857
No, it's not just a case.

30:46.892 --> 30:48.859
It's my senior partnership.
What?

30:48.894 --> 30:50.839
But I thought Louis said...
I know what he said,

30:50.863 --> 30:52.796
but there was a hitch.

30:54.363 --> 30:56.697
This was the case
to put me over the top.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.602
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because it's my career

31:01.637 --> 31:03.337
and my responsibility.

31:03.372 --> 31:04.449
Katrina,
I'm not just the other name

31:04.473 --> 31:07.174
on this lawsuit;
I'm your friend.

31:08.210 --> 31:11.366
If senior partner's on the line
for you, it is for me too.

31:11.367 --> 31:12.499
Now, we can still...

31:12.535 --> 31:15.102
Not just a name on a lawsuit.

31:17.206 --> 31:19.106
- That's it.
- What's it?

31:19.141 --> 31:21.508
The attorney of record
on this suit isn't

31:21.544 --> 31:23.544
the same attorney
Aiken took the deposition with.

31:23.579 --> 31:25.057
He changed lawyers in
the middle of the case.

31:25.081 --> 31:25.946
What are you getting at?

31:25.982 --> 31:27.982
They sent back
the deposition last night

31:28.017 --> 31:30.656
and the new guy signed it.
Brian, it's one thing

31:30.657 --> 31:32.324
to have him handle
the slander case,

31:32.359 --> 31:33.658
but to sign off
on a deposition.

31:33.694 --> 31:35.227
Holy shit.

31:35.262 --> 31:36.339
The first guy knew
Aiken was lying,

31:36.363 --> 31:39.331
and he wouldn't sign it.
He wouldn't suborn perjury.

31:39.366 --> 31:41.132
Katrina, we got him.

31:41.168 --> 31:43.168
I know.

31:43.203 --> 31:44.469
Okay.

31:44.504 --> 31:46.304
We're going to get that tape.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.517
We're gonna look
at his reaction

31:47.541 --> 31:49.107
when Aiken says he's innocent.

31:49.142 --> 31:51.005
We're gonna find out
their entire history together.

31:51.006 --> 31:52.706
I don't care
if it takes all night.

31:52.741 --> 31:54.693
This is fantastic.
I'm gonna go order that masala;

31:54.694 --> 31:55.838
you're gonna get it all
over your face;

31:55.862 --> 31:57.406
I'm not even gonna tell you
about it this time.

31:57.430 --> 31:58.629
You better tell me about it

31:58.665 --> 31:59.709
just like you better
get extra naan.

31:59.733 --> 32:01.032
Triple supreme naan it is.

32:01.067 --> 32:03.045
I'm just gonna go order it,
call my wife real quick

32:03.069 --> 32:04.613
to tell her not to wait up,
and then you and I...

32:04.637 --> 32:06.904
Wait, stop.
No.

32:06.940 --> 32:08.773
No what?

32:08.808 --> 32:10.608
You're not staying tonight.

32:10.643 --> 32:13.411
I can handle this myself,
and I'm going to.

32:15.382 --> 32:17.782
Katrina, what's going on?
Did I do something wrong?

32:17.817 --> 32:20.318
You've done nothing wrong,
Brian.

32:20.353 --> 32:23.054
But you've got a wife
and a baby,

32:23.089 --> 32:24.367
and I'm not going
to keep you from them

32:24.391 --> 32:26.324
anymore than I already have.

32:26.359 --> 32:28.359
Katrina, I told you
if your partnership's

32:28.395 --> 32:30.428
on the line,
my partnership's on the line.

32:30.463 --> 32:33.164
I know, but I got this.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.724
Go home.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.756
You mind if I come in?

32:49.458 --> 32:50.657
No.

32:50.693 --> 32:51.625
I was just about
to come see you.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.527
Well, before you tell me why,

32:53.562 --> 32:55.696
I'd like to apologize.

32:55.731 --> 32:58.465
You would?

32:58.501 --> 33:00.434
Yes.

33:00.469 --> 33:03.537
I realized
I'm too close to this.

33:03.572 --> 33:06.406
And instead of hearing you,
I lashed out, and I'm sorry.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.976
You realized?

33:09.011 --> 33:10.377
I went to see Alex.

33:10.412 --> 33:11.311
Well, that's funny,

33:11.347 --> 33:14.448
because I wanted
to apologize too.

33:14.483 --> 33:16.483
You wanted to apologize?

33:18.587 --> 33:21.188
Donna, I told you
I wouldn't take action,

33:21.223 --> 33:25.125
and I shouldn't have.
But I couldn't help myself.

33:25.161 --> 33:27.261
because I care about
the kids this charity

33:27.296 --> 33:29.730
is supposed to serve.

33:29.765 --> 33:31.865
But you wouldn't know that,
because like you said,

33:31.901 --> 33:33.834
I never tell anyone
the full story.

33:33.869 --> 33:35.247
And the reason
I never tell the full story

33:35.271 --> 33:37.604
is because I just don't trust...

33:37.640 --> 33:39.640
People.

33:39.675 --> 33:42.242
Pretty much.
Yeah.

33:44.133 --> 33:45.677
Alex talked to you after
he talked to me, didn't he?

33:45.701 --> 33:47.367
He did.

33:47.403 --> 33:48.713
We might have to do something
about that guy.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.504
We might.

33:50.539 --> 33:53.106
But not before we do something
about this situation.

33:53.142 --> 33:55.446
Because I'm not gonna
let them get away

33:55.563 --> 33:56.863
with scamming children.

33:56.898 --> 33:58.598
I'm with you on that.

33:58.633 --> 34:00.800
Then let me ask.

34:00.835 --> 34:02.602
You read people.

34:02.637 --> 34:04.904
Are you absolutely sure
Peggy wasn't in on this,

34:04.939 --> 34:07.340
because they could have
fired her even if she was.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.976
I am 100% sure.

34:11.713 --> 34:13.612
Then I know what to do.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.681
I'm glad you decided
to come in.

34:19.417 --> 34:20.681
You mind if I ask how

34:20.717 --> 34:21.862
you got Louis to agree
to let me see you?

34:21.886 --> 34:25.893
I don't,
but I would prefer to ask:

34:25.895 --> 34:28.355
when Louis came in
and said you were losing

34:28.356 --> 34:32.025
this McKernon Motors,
how did you feel?

34:32.060 --> 34:33.760
You want to just
jump right in, huh?

34:33.795 --> 34:34.893
Yes, I do.

34:34.929 --> 34:37.196
Well, how do you think
I felt? I didn't like it.

34:37.232 --> 34:38.842
Because you were losing
your oldest client?

34:38.867 --> 34:39.931
Because Louis told me

34:39.967 --> 34:41.900
there was nothing
I could do about it.

34:41.936 --> 34:44.637
And then Donna came in
and said Joan was there,

34:44.672 --> 34:46.706
and Louis couldn't even
take care of her.

34:46.741 --> 34:49.742
- And it irritated you?
- It infuriated me.

34:49.777 --> 34:51.811
- Why?
- Because he told me

34:51.846 --> 34:53.513
that I couldn't have
what I wanted

34:53.547 --> 34:55.849
and then he put
his own selfish interests

34:55.850 --> 34:57.081
above the firm's.

34:57.118 --> 34:58.784
Forgive me, Harvey,

34:58.820 --> 35:00.986
but isn't that Louis'
historical concern about you?

35:01.474 --> 35:02.274
This is different.

35:02.275 --> 35:03.484
I think perhaps
it is different

35:03.508 --> 35:05.542
because he is the one
doing it to you,

35:05.577 --> 35:07.243
and more importantly,

35:07.279 --> 35:09.915
what those
selfish interests are.

35:09.916 --> 35:10.946
What are you getting at?

35:10.947 --> 35:13.114
When you two were here,
you spent

35:13.150 --> 35:14.916
quite a lot of time
on Louis having a baby.

35:14.951 --> 35:16.718
So?

35:16.753 --> 35:19.287
So would you ever want
to have a baby? Or a family?

35:19.323 --> 35:20.989
I have a family,
and if you're gonna say

35:21.024 --> 35:22.802
this has something to do
with my brother's divorce...

35:22.826 --> 35:25.193
I didn't even know your
brother was getting a divorce.

35:25.228 --> 35:26.995
Well, he is.

35:27.030 --> 35:29.597
- That must be painful.
- Of course it's painful.

35:29.633 --> 35:32.000
My family's falling apart,
and at the same time

35:32.035 --> 35:33.468
I'm getting it rubbed
in my face

35:33.503 --> 35:35.904
that Louis' family is growing.

35:38.108 --> 35:41.609
Forgive me, Harvey,
but...

35:41.830 --> 35:44.831
Louis did not rub anything
in your face.

35:45.834 --> 35:46.766
No, he didn't.

35:46.801 --> 35:48.968
But perhaps it feels that way

35:49.004 --> 35:51.471
because for the first time,

35:51.506 --> 35:54.046
Louis has something
in his life that you do not.

35:54.047 --> 35:56.537
Jesus Christ, you're saying
I'm envious of Louis.

35:56.538 --> 35:57.376
And what if you were?

35:57.377 --> 35:59.779
I'd ask what in God's name
am I supposed to do with that?

35:59.780 --> 36:01.658
Does is it occur to you
to share that with him?

36:01.682 --> 36:04.015
No, even if I wanted to,
he's pissed off at me.

36:04.051 --> 36:05.650
He would forgive you
in a moment.

36:05.686 --> 36:08.453
And even if he did,
I'm afraid to...

36:08.488 --> 36:09.821
To what, Harvey?

36:10.240 --> 36:11.606
Louis makes space
for the people

36:11.641 --> 36:13.241
in his life whom he loves.

36:13.276 --> 36:15.643
He makes space for people
like Sheila and a baby,

36:15.678 --> 36:16.877
but...
But what?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.179
But once he has that baby,

36:18.214 --> 36:21.415
he might not make space for me.

36:21.451 --> 36:24.518
Where would you get
a notion like that,

36:24.554 --> 36:26.887
that Louis wouldn't
have time for you?

36:26.923 --> 36:30.491
Because they leave.
Everyone leaves:

36:30.526 --> 36:34.495
Mike, Rachel, Jessica,
my sister-in-law.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.767
Everyone.

36:39.802 --> 36:42.403
Well, I can tell you

36:42.438 --> 36:44.772
if you keep treating
Louis like this,

36:44.807 --> 36:46.874
you may cause him
to leave yourself.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.480
James Davenport?
I'm Donna Paulsen,

36:54.516 --> 36:57.116
and this is my colleague
Samantha Wheeler.

36:57.152 --> 36:58.785
The same Samantha Wheeler

36:58.820 --> 37:00.720
that had a $5 million donation
yanked from us?

37:00.755 --> 37:02.622
The Samantha Wheeler
who offered you a venue

37:02.657 --> 37:04.490
for your next event
for a fraction of the one

37:04.526 --> 37:06.659
you've been using,
and you said no.

37:06.695 --> 37:08.895
Which means you cut a deal
with your current venue

37:08.930 --> 37:11.464
where you overpay and they
kick back a percentage to you.

37:11.499 --> 37:13.800
Specifically,
.3% of your annual budget.

37:13.835 --> 37:16.636
- Get out of my office.
- I don't think so, James.

37:16.671 --> 37:18.382
Because we may not have
had time to find proof,

37:18.406 --> 37:20.106
but a reporter will.

37:20.141 --> 37:21.819
Especially after we tell them
that you fired

37:21.843 --> 37:23.421
an innocent woman
just because a potential donor

37:23.445 --> 37:24.867
asked a few questions
about your books.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.146
When you put it that way,
it sounds like

37:26.170 --> 37:27.871
he did all this
to cover his guilty ass.

37:27.872 --> 37:28.838
Maybe we should give that
to the "Journal."

37:28.873 --> 37:30.906
That's a nice turn of phrase.

37:30.942 --> 37:31.874
Thank you, Donna.

37:31.909 --> 37:33.542
What do you want?

37:33.578 --> 37:34.922
We want you to step down
and name

37:34.946 --> 37:36.159
Peggy Davis
as your replacement.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.660
- You can't be serious.
- You don't want to find out

37:38.695 --> 37:40.494
how serious we are, James.

37:40.495 --> 37:42.595
Because you're looking
at two pissed-off women

37:42.631 --> 37:45.398
who know exactly what you did
and how to prove it.

37:48.537 --> 37:50.403
You'll have my resignation
by tonight.

37:50.438 --> 37:52.138
Good.
And don't look at me like that.

37:52.174 --> 37:53.606
If it wouldn't mean
your charity

37:53.642 --> 37:55.253
would go out of business,
you'd be spending

37:55.277 --> 37:57.577
the next five years in prison.

38:07.088 --> 38:08.288
Hey.

38:08.323 --> 38:10.023
Hey.

38:10.058 --> 38:11.424
How'd it go?

38:12.422 --> 38:14.160
We won.

38:15.697 --> 38:17.096
Listen, about last night...

38:17.132 --> 38:18.643
Brian, I didn't mean
to come off like...

38:18.667 --> 38:20.233
You didn't come off
like anything.

38:20.268 --> 38:23.536
I just wanted to thank you
for not making me stay.

38:23.572 --> 38:26.439
- But I thought you wanted...
- I know. I wanted to help.

38:26.474 --> 38:29.642
But Julie and I,
we had a great time.

38:29.678 --> 38:32.011
Austin slept through the night,
and we actually stayed up

38:32.047 --> 38:33.580
and watched
"The Breakfast Club."

38:33.615 --> 38:35.348
What's that?

38:35.383 --> 38:40.587
Uh, just Julie and my
favorite movie of all time.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.188
- I've never heard of it.
- Oh, my God.

38:42.224 --> 38:43.334
You've never even heard of it?

38:43.358 --> 38:45.725
You have to see it.
I'm bringing you a copy.

38:47.596 --> 38:49.329
Brian,
you don't have to do that.

38:49.364 --> 38:51.297
I know I don't,
but that's what friends do.

38:53.473 --> 38:54.439
Friends.

38:54.474 --> 38:56.607
Yeah, friends.

38:56.643 --> 38:58.109
That's what we said, right?

38:58.144 --> 38:59.744
Yes, it is.

38:59.779 --> 39:03.348
And thanks, I would love
to see it sometime.

39:05.085 --> 39:06.451
Hey, you want to get
some lunch?

39:06.486 --> 39:07.986
Sure.

39:08.021 --> 39:10.855
I mean, that's also
what friends do, right?

39:12.125 --> 39:13.858
Am I your first friend?

39:16.096 --> 39:18.096
You know you're not.

39:18.131 --> 39:20.431
Come on, let's go.

39:23.556 --> 39:25.705
You get
that letter of resignation?

39:25.706 --> 39:27.439
Right here.

39:27.474 --> 39:30.408
And Peggy's job offer
is on its way.

39:30.444 --> 39:33.245
- Look, Donna...
- Listen, Samantha...

39:33.280 --> 39:36.414
Let me go first this time.

39:36.450 --> 39:39.317
I was thinking
about how I don't trust people.

39:39.353 --> 39:41.920
And I thought
maybe I should start.

39:41.955 --> 39:43.922
And then I thought,

39:43.957 --> 39:45.891
maybe I should start
by telling you

39:45.926 --> 39:49.794
why I cared so much about this
charity in the first place.

39:49.830 --> 39:53.498
Is this a rosé story
or a martini story?

39:53.534 --> 39:55.233
Whiskey.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.736
How about tonight?

39:57.771 --> 39:58.637
That would be nice.

39:58.672 --> 40:01.039
Meet you in the lobby
in half an hour?

40:01.074 --> 40:02.307
You got it.

40:02.342 --> 40:03.642
See you down there.

40:08.335 --> 40:11.655
I'm glad I caught you in here
of all places.

40:11.755 --> 40:13.255
Why's that?

40:13.290 --> 40:15.357
Because we have
a lot of history here.

40:15.392 --> 40:16.670
And it seems
like the right place

40:16.694 --> 40:18.560
for me to make things right.

40:18.596 --> 40:19.806
You must have gone
to see Stan.

40:19.830 --> 40:23.532
I did.
Thank you for that.

40:23.567 --> 40:27.336
Make things right.
Thanking me.

40:27.371 --> 40:28.570
What went on in there?

40:28.606 --> 40:30.272
Among other things,

40:30.307 --> 40:32.441
he helped me realize
I care about you;

40:32.476 --> 40:34.409
I value you;

40:34.445 --> 40:35.477
and I was afraid of...

40:35.512 --> 40:36.945
Losing me?

40:36.981 --> 40:38.981
Which is why
you pushed me away.

40:39.016 --> 40:40.182
Oh, my God.

40:40.217 --> 40:41.950
You pulled a Litt.

40:41.986 --> 40:43.251
Harvey, you became me.

40:43.287 --> 40:44.431
Louis,
I wouldn't go that far.

40:44.455 --> 40:47.789
Oh, no, you would.
And you did.

40:47.825 --> 40:49.357
We are brothers
from another mother.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.615
And if you don't say that
right now,

40:51.650 --> 40:52.714
I'm gonna tell everyone
you're afraid of losing me.

40:52.715 --> 40:53.664
- Louis.
- Right now.

40:53.665 --> 40:55.230
Starting with Paul Porter.

40:58.613 --> 41:00.313
We're brothers
from another mother.

41:00.348 --> 41:02.159
I'm sorry, I couldn't...
could you repeat that?

41:02.183 --> 41:03.549
- No, Louis, I couldn't.
- Why not?

41:03.585 --> 41:05.418
Because I know
you're about to record it

41:05.453 --> 41:07.153
on your Dictaphone.
And what if I am?

41:07.188 --> 41:08.921
Because if you don't
say it again,

41:08.957 --> 41:10.234
I'm gonna tell everyone
you're afraid of losing me.

41:10.258 --> 41:11.858
And if you say that
one more time,

41:11.893 --> 41:13.738
our friendship's over,
and I'm never looking back.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.172
Because I suffered
a momentary weakness,

41:15.196 --> 41:17.296
but let's not forget
who's who in this situation.

41:17.332 --> 41:18.765
I'll never mention it again.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.244
Now, put your hands
where I can see 'em.

41:20.268 --> 41:21.868
- Why?
- Just do it.

41:29.611 --> 41:31.767
What the hell
did you do that for?

41:31.768 --> 41:34.169
Because, you and me
are going out tonight.

41:34.204 --> 41:36.171
I'm gonna say
a lot of nice things to you,

41:36.206 --> 41:38.006
and there isn't gonna be
any record of it.

41:38.041 --> 41:39.474
I can live with that.

41:39.509 --> 41:41.576
Wait a minute.

41:41.611 --> 41:44.312
How long did it take for you
to come to that with Stan?

41:44.347 --> 41:46.548
- About 25 minutes, why?
- I don't believe it.

41:46.583 --> 41:49.025
You're even better at therapy
than I am.

41:49.026 --> 41:50.592
Maybe I am.
But trust me.

41:50.627 --> 41:52.766
Stan likes you better than me,
and he always will.

41:52.767 --> 41:55.467
- You really think so?
- No, Louis, I don't.
