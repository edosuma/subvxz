WEBVTT

01:29.208 --> 01:37.208
The way back

07:10.125 --> 07:12.081
Look at those poor men.

07:12.208 --> 07:13.664
They've got night blindness.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.748
I saw it in the transit camp.

07:15.875 --> 07:18.742
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.789
Here, here.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.199
You planning on surviving
on half rations, son?

07:49.333 --> 07:50.333
Look, he's an old man.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.948
I'm an old man.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.540
I'll be alive in the morning.
He won't.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.574
Kindness.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.448
That can kill you here.

08:06.292 --> 08:07.657
He's American.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.364
In here? How?

08:11.458 --> 08:14.325
Stalin hates foreigners,

08:14.458 --> 08:16.870
and that includes poles.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.532
You're Polish, no?

08:18.583 --> 08:19.698
Uh-huh.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.661
I like you poles.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.499
Your burning sense of injustice,

08:24.625 --> 08:27.162
the yearning for freedom.

08:27.292 --> 08:30.659
Khabarov... andrei timofeyevich.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.874
Weiszczek... janusz.

08:32.917 --> 08:35.703
Your charge, may I ask, janusz?

08:35.832 --> 08:40.246
58-10

08:40.375 --> 08:42.035
a spy.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.032
That's what they told me.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.532
Ten years?

08:45.667 --> 08:47.578
No 20

08:47.708 --> 08:50.700
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.040
And you were on Soviet side of line,

08:53.167 --> 08:55.704
and they arrest you.
They accuse you of spying.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.162
Torture you, huh?

08:58.292 --> 08:59.702
Did you sign confession?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.206
No.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.915
No, I wouldn't sign,

09:04.042 --> 09:07.239
so they... they tortured someone else.

09:07.375 --> 09:11.038
Forgive me.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.199
I was actor.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.740
Moving pictures.

09:14.875 --> 09:19.494
In my last picture,
I played aristocrat.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.832
They arrested me when the film
was released

09:21.958 --> 09:23.368
why?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.161
It was claimed

09:25.250 --> 09:30.699
I was elevating the status
of the old nobility.

09:30.833 --> 09:34.246
So you got ten years
for a performance in a film.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.741
I've had better notices.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.865
Nyet.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.532
The urki.

10:03.625 --> 10:06.367
Do you know who these are?

10:06.458 --> 10:09.040
Professional criminals.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.366
Murderers and thieves.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.369
Don't stare at them.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.870
The guards let them run things in here,

10:15.958 --> 10:17.494
and they are to be feared.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.323
Then why would they
let them run things?

10:19.417 --> 10:22.409
Because they are byproduct of
bourgeois society

10:22.500 --> 10:24.491
and so friends of people.

10:24.583 --> 10:30.704
We are political prisoners and
so enemies of people.

10:30.792 --> 10:34.239
The Soviet union
has become one vast prison.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.324
Slave labor.

10:36.417 --> 10:39.534
They are from far reaches of
Soviet empire,

10:39.625 --> 10:43.914
all caught up in same net.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.163
And, uh, do any of them
wriggle out of the net?

10:47.250 --> 10:51.289
No, janusz. You must be more careful.

10:54.708 --> 10:57.575
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

10:57.667 --> 10:59.157
even in here.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.162
If you are not more careful,

11:02.250 --> 11:04.411
you will die after one year.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.081
If not literally,

11:09.208 --> 11:12.166
then spirit.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.913
And how long have you been in here?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.743
Eleven months and 29 days.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.206
You do for me.

13:58.292 --> 13:59.907
You want me to draw you?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.082
No not me.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.038
Lice?

15:19.125 --> 15:20.865
Eating me alive.

15:20.875 --> 15:23.867
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.240
The mine.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.289
They blast at night.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.699
What are you doing?

15:36.708 --> 15:40.030
We must be quick.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.537
Or this will not be
here in the morning.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.957
You're going to
leave it here overnight? Why?

15:46.625 --> 15:47.625
You'll see.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.537
It can be done.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.240
I know a way through the wire.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.698
How?

16:11.792 --> 16:13.657
Lazar, my associate,

16:13.750 --> 16:15.741
he is overseer of construction.

16:15.833 --> 16:18.040
He showed me.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.867
If you ever escape the camps,

16:20.875 --> 16:23.992
and I've been waiting
so long for someone like you,

16:24.083 --> 16:26.165
someone with the strength,

16:26.250 --> 16:28.366
the will to see it through.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.369
But to go where?

16:30.458 --> 16:32.540
I mean, we can't go west.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.329
I mean, apart from the Germans,
there's the Soviets.

16:35.417 --> 16:38.909
And east,
all Soviet right to the pacific.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.536
No, no, no, no.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.203
North have to be... have to be south.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.998
Correct.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.699
But do you know where we are?
I mean, exactly?

16:46.708 --> 16:53.614
I belleve we are about 500 kilometers
north of lake baikal

16:53.708 --> 16:55.869
this is the lake.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.368
Camp is here.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.206
And the border is here.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.369
We could follow the edge
of the lake here.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.244
That runs due south.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.699
Exactly. Then we cross the
trans-siberian railway

17:05.791 --> 17:09.329
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

17:09.416 --> 17:11.078
Spring is already upon us.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.748
We will have to wait till Autumn.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.039
No. Why wait?

17:14.041 --> 17:16.078
Why?

17:16.166 --> 17:18.874
Because it is a thousand kilometers
to the border, maybe more.

17:18.875 --> 17:22.492
We need careful planning.
We need to stockpile food.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.074
I've already begun trading, dealing.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.906
You must do the same.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.707
And in Autumn,
the weather is more predictable.

17:33.583 --> 17:37.656
We can use the new snow
to cover our tracks.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.082
And we bring my friends.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.032
Your friends? You trust them?

17:42.042 --> 17:43.657
Of course.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.537
They won't all survive.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.616
But they will die free men.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.164
Free

20:19.167 --> 20:22.000
That's a really brave man!

20:57.792 --> 20:59.748
First we need big branches!

20:59.833 --> 21:02.791
One on each side
and then one on the back!

21:08.417 --> 21:10.078
Help me, kazik.

21:10.167 --> 21:13.000
These down there,
put it there on the branch.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.539
Yes, yes.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.123
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.285
What?

21:17.375 --> 21:18.660
Good.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.665
Yes put it there.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.414
Zoran! Your blanket!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.912
For a wind break.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.707
Get in. Come on.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.248
Come!

21:35.375 --> 21:37.707
Please come with us! We have shelter!

21:51.000 --> 21:55.994
I am zoran, Yugoslav. That's janusz.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.748
And he's kazik.

21:57.833 --> 21:58.833
Horodinsky.

21:58.917 --> 21:59.997
They are Polish.

22:00.083 --> 22:04.156
Voss I'm Latvian.

22:04.250 --> 22:07.208
It's a league of nations.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.539
And you are?

22:08.542 --> 22:10.749
Smith.

22:10.833 --> 22:12.323
And your first name.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.699
Mister

22:14.833 --> 22:16.448
Mr. Smith.

22:16.583 --> 22:17.948
That's right.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.739
Might as well have shot us yesterday.

22:51.833 --> 22:55.280
We're for the mines.

23:17.208 --> 23:21.531
These collars same as used by
ancient Egyptian people.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.500
Yes, but on their horses, probably.

23:24.542 --> 23:27.375
No. No, no, no. Same for people.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.785
How do you know?

23:28.917 --> 23:31.158
I was professor of egyptology,

23:31.292 --> 23:33.874
Leningrad university.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.662
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.282
I've got to get out of here.

24:38.375 --> 24:42.995
I have to get back.

24:49.833 --> 24:50.948
It can be done.

24:51.042 --> 24:52.407
What can be done?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.780
He knows a way through the wire.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.743
He has a plan.

24:57.833 --> 25:00.165
Shh. Who has a plan?

25:00.167 --> 25:02.829
His name is khabarov.

25:02.917 --> 25:04.373
The actor.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.914
Do you know him?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.956
He has no intention of escaping.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.042
What do you mean?

25:12.125 --> 25:13.831
He's a liar.

25:13.917 --> 25:16.499
He's been here for years.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.832
Seeks out new arrivals.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.953
Me, when I first came here.

25:21.042 --> 25:23.829
He just likes to talk about escape.

25:23.917 --> 25:25.623
I've known others like him.

25:25.708 --> 25:27.824
Why should I believe you?

25:27.917 --> 25:30.203
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.

25:30.292 --> 25:34.365
From you he gets your energy,
your spirit.

25:34.458 --> 25:36.619
You feed his dream of escape.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.494
You help keep him alive.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.287
He's nothing but a leech.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.661
You are a cold bastard, mister.

25:43.750 --> 25:47.789
I'm still alive, that's all I know.

25:47.875 --> 25:50.161
But I won't be in another six months,

25:50.167 --> 25:51.828
and neither will you. Not here.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.248
Not in these mines.

25:59.958 --> 26:04.531
But if you are serious...

26:04.625 --> 26:09.494
Really serious about
making a run for it...

26:09.583 --> 26:13.155
I'm with you.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.286
I thought you were a loner.

26:15.375 --> 26:17.457
It can't be done alone.

26:17.542 --> 26:21.660
Besides, you have a... a weakness.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.123
You could be useful to me.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.948
And what is that?

26:25.042 --> 26:26.998
Kindness.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.664
If anything happens to me,

26:28.667 --> 26:30.703
I'm counting on you carrying me.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.490
Khabarov

26:38.583 --> 26:39.618
khabarov, come.

26:39.708 --> 26:40.743
What?

26:40.833 --> 26:41.993
Come with me. Now.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.118
What is it? What? What?

26:43.208 --> 26:44.208
Come. Look at this.

26:44.292 --> 26:45.623
I ook at this.

26:45.708 --> 26:48.495
We can go. We can go tonight.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.536
The storm will cover our tracks.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.161
No, no, no. What are you talking about?
It's a passing storm!

26:52.167 --> 26:53.452
No, it's enough.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.032
Janusz, that is impossible.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.366
We need... we need detailed preparation,

26:57.458 --> 26:58.994
we need plans, we need maps.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.165
No, no,
the timing will never be perfect.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.956
Look, they won't expect it now.

27:03.042 --> 27:04.373
Are you crazy?

27:04.458 --> 27:06.289
What about the distances, huh?

27:06.375 --> 27:08.616
It's, it's a thousand kilometers,
and we need food

27:08.708 --> 27:10.198
plenty of food.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.684
But, but we have food. You have food.

27:11.708 --> 27:13.198
Look, the American is with us.

27:13.292 --> 27:14.998
We've been trading, just like you said.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.331
How long will that last?

27:16.417 --> 27:17.702
Look, I've spent half my life

27:17.792 --> 27:18.998
in the woods and mountains.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.825
We can live off the land.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.994
You don't understand.
You are too young.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.035
It cannot be done.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.160
What else is there?

27:26.167 --> 27:27.327
You hear me?

27:27.417 --> 27:28.452
To stay here and die?

27:28.542 --> 27:30.078
It cannot be done.

27:30.167 --> 27:31.998
Andrei!
How do we get through that wire?

27:32.083 --> 27:34.165
I don't know
what you are talking about.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.203
Your friend llazar...

27:36.292 --> 27:38.783
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

27:38.875 --> 27:40.490
You told me that.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.911
Piss off now.

28:08.292 --> 28:09.623
You can't see, can you?

28:12.583 --> 28:14.323
Please don't leave me behind.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.948
Promise me, andrejs.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.203
I can hold onto
your shoulder by night.

28:18.292 --> 28:19.702
I can... I can see shapes.

28:19.792 --> 28:22.499
By day I can see just fine.

28:22.583 --> 28:26.155
I won't hold you up.

28:26.167 --> 28:30.331
Please don't tell the others.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.989
In here, I die.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.740
Swiss.

29:44.542 --> 29:46.498
There are no secrets here.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.164
What do you want?

29:48.250 --> 29:50.662
The game goes against me.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.784
Small debt, they take fingers.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.491
Big debt, they take head.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.786
Me, big debt.

29:58.875 --> 30:02.493
But I never gambie my wolf.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.036
In forest, you need knife,

30:04.125 --> 30:06.662
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

31:29.375 --> 31:30.865
Come on! Come onl!

31:30.958 --> 31:32.698
Look! Keep going. Keep going!

31:32.792 --> 31:34.123
We must keep going! Get up!

31:34.208 --> 31:35.664
Get up!

31:35.750 --> 31:37.490
Activity, or we die right now.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.824
You know how fast the dogs are.

31:39.833 --> 31:41.539
Run, damn you!

31:41.625 --> 31:43.991
Mister, come on, look at me.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.324
Is it time for me to carry you?

31:46.333 --> 31:48.619
Come on. Come on.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.073
Come onl!

31:52.958 --> 31:57.156
Janusz, we can't see anything!

31:57.250 --> 32:00.117
The snow is blinding us!

32:11.500 --> 32:12.910
I need your knife!

32:16.083 --> 32:18.495
Give me the knife!

32:18.500 --> 32:20.411
Your knifel

32:27.917 --> 32:30.829
Janusz, we must take shelter!

32:30.833 --> 32:32.198
We can't go on!

32:32.292 --> 32:35.329
Don't you see? This is perfect!

32:35.417 --> 32:36.998
They'll never find us like this.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.240
Never!

33:09.167 --> 33:12.785
You stare at me like snake at rabbit

33:12.875 --> 33:14.991
he teach me english.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.491
Speak good, huh?

33:17.583 --> 33:22.873
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

33:22.958 --> 33:24.869
How far have we come?

33:24.958 --> 33:28.496
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.039
That's all?

33:30.125 --> 33:32.116
Less, if we've been going in circles

33:32.208 --> 33:34.039
like chicken without head.

33:34.125 --> 33:38.448
All right, let's see what we have.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.456
Everyone, come on.

33:41.542 --> 33:45.364
We share everything.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.994
And you?

33:47.083 --> 33:48.118
What?

33:48.208 --> 33:49.823
Do you have?

33:56.833 --> 33:58.369
And that coat.

33:58.458 --> 33:59.823
It's not your coat.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.953
That is khabarov's coat.

34:02.042 --> 34:05.284
Yes, he gave me.

34:05.375 --> 34:06.410
And

34:12.125 --> 34:14.331
Huh? Huh?

34:15.417 --> 34:16.496
See?

34:21.167 --> 34:23.533
He was going to inform.

34:23.625 --> 34:26.492
Don't worry. I talk to him.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.909
Everything okay.

34:37.792 --> 34:40.329
You've made a bargain with the devil.

34:40.417 --> 34:41.657
You realize that?

34:41.667 --> 34:43.157
Do you have a knife?

34:50.958 --> 34:53.824
For direction he uses grass
and the mosses \what's that?

34:53.833 --> 34:55.915
I swear to god
he better know what he's doing.

34:56.042 --> 34:58.203
You should be grateful
you're here at all.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.123
Grateful is for dogs.

35:07.958 --> 35:10.995
What... what's that?

35:11.083 --> 35:13.665
Woives. It's only wolves.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.373
Only wolves.

36:17.292 --> 36:20.830
South.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.283
To lake baikal

36:30.292 --> 36:32.624
You are the pakhan.

36:32.750 --> 36:33.750
Am I?

36:33.875 --> 36:35.957
What is a pakhan?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.833
Boss of urki.

36:38.917 --> 36:41.124
We are not criminals.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.449
We are escaping from criminals.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.956
I have been watching you.

36:45.083 --> 36:47.790
And I swear to god you win my respect

36:47.917 --> 36:49.999
with your sticks and pine cones.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.450
I'll come between you and death.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.741
So you want to be my bodyguard?

36:55.875 --> 36:57.331
It's the urka way.

36:57.458 --> 37:01.326
You have me, and you have the wolf.

37:01.458 --> 37:03.289
Huh?

37:03.417 --> 37:05.783
Janusz,
how long till we get to the lake?

37:05.833 --> 37:06.948
How long?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.831
Three, four weeks.

37:08.958 --> 37:10.698
Maybe more.

37:20.417 --> 37:22.999
I have us here somewhere.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.958
And down here,
the trans-siberian railway,

37:26.083 --> 37:28.290
and the border of Mongolia.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.490
Mongolia seems so far away.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.332
Mongolia? I go more.

37:34.417 --> 37:37.614
To America.

37:37.750 --> 37:42.619
It's like this...
We have food for another week.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.115
We have no more matches.

37:44.250 --> 37:47.242
But still we have khabarov's flint.

37:47.375 --> 37:48.785
We need meat

37:48.833 --> 37:50.949
I can make traps.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.457
We'll be moving
too fast to wait for traps.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.996
We find farms,
villages, get food there.

37:57.125 --> 37:59.286
Look, there's a bounty on our heads.
Remember that.

37:59.417 --> 38:02.079
We steal it. At night.
They never know.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.618
We are not thieves.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.454
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.618
You can watch.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.747
What is that?

38:08.875 --> 38:10.035
Barbed wire.

38:10.167 --> 38:11.953
He's making a fish-hook.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.410
That's how we will survive.

38:13.542 --> 38:14.281
With fish?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.448
Uh.

38:15.583 --> 38:17.244
But I don't eat fish.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.375
Then you'll die.

38:21.292 --> 38:22.623
Come on,

38:22.750 --> 38:25.116
we heed to make a fire.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.623
Come on, lots of wood.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.500
It'll be 40 below tonight.

38:29.625 --> 38:30.625
Tomasz?

38:44.833 --> 38:47.791
No, no, not too much, not too much.

39:01.083 --> 39:02.198
Kazik?

39:06.958 --> 39:08.494
Kazik?

39:08.625 --> 39:11.992
He's still out, looking for wood.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.324
He has night blindness.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.038
Kazikl

39:32.583 --> 39:34.198
Janusz!

39:42.875 --> 39:44.456
Janusz!

40:37.792 --> 40:39.453
Professor.

40:39.542 --> 40:41.078
I came from the mine to find you.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.164
I thought I was alone.

40:46.250 --> 40:49.947
I've been walking with you
for some time.

40:50.042 --> 40:52.658
I'll...
I'll just sit for a minute.

41:06.833 --> 41:09.074
Not far to go.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.039
We made it.

41:20.542 --> 41:23.158
We really made it.

41:26.292 --> 41:28.624
Isn't that something?

42:18.625 --> 42:23.119
Lord, take this
innocent soul into thy keeping.

42:23.208 --> 42:28.657
Amen.

42:28.750 --> 42:31.036
A free man died here today.

42:36.250 --> 42:38.912
Still, one less mouth to feed.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.790
What?

44:05.917 --> 44:08.784
They'll find our bones
and your drawings

44:08.792 --> 44:10.908
a hundred years from now

44:11.000 --> 44:15.494
and say "look,
a fine example of early gulag man."

44:15.583 --> 44:17.949
Shut up with your jokes.

44:17.958 --> 44:19.789
Go and find food like the others do.

44:19.875 --> 44:21.740
You do the shutting up!

44:21.833 --> 44:23.448
Drawing all day
like you're on holiday.

44:23.542 --> 44:24.748
I'm sick.

44:24.833 --> 44:26.949
I cook. They find food.

44:27.042 --> 44:28.122
What do you ever do?

44:28.208 --> 44:31.120
Nothing.

44:31.208 --> 44:33.574
But I make you all laugh.

44:33.667 --> 44:35.874
No, not anymore, you don't.

45:02.875 --> 45:04.740
So

45:04.833 --> 45:09.327
Who will be first?

45:09.417 --> 45:10.998
What do you mean, first?

45:11.083 --> 45:12.948
The first to die.

45:13.042 --> 45:16.000
I think the artist.

45:16.083 --> 45:19.280
But better if it was him,
the funny man.

45:19.292 --> 45:22.955
Why better if it's zoran?

45:22.958 --> 45:25.620
More soft

45:25.708 --> 45:28.780
more... tender.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.742
Mister only catch little fish now.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.744
We must have meat, or we die here.

45:37.833 --> 45:40.074
You're the pakhan,
you've thought of it.

45:40.167 --> 45:41.873
We all have.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.684
That's why you brought extra people,
isn't it?

45:43.708 --> 45:44.572
For food?

45:44.667 --> 45:46.453
No, no, no.

45:46.542 --> 45:48.123
We will get more food
when we get to lake baikal.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.990
There will be plenty of fish there.

45:50.083 --> 45:53.905
You said we would have
seen lake a week ago.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.286
Huh?

45:56.292 --> 45:59.329
We're lost, pakhan.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.115
Raahl!

46:51.208 --> 46:53.073
Yaah!

46:57.000 --> 46:58.615
Yaah!

46:58.708 --> 47:01.040
Yaah! Yaah!

47:29.958 --> 47:32.825
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,

47:32.917 --> 47:35.784
I will be back in a week.

47:35.875 --> 47:41.825
If I don't, well, you're on your own.

47:45.708 --> 47:46.948
I know.

47:46.958 --> 47:49.119
Our friend valka.

47:49.125 --> 47:51.366
Don't let him out of your sight.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.248
Here.

47:59.542 --> 48:01.328
Fresh this morning.

48:04.250 --> 48:05.660
Thank you.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.368
Good luck.

48:11.917 --> 48:14.499
And you.

50:04.792 --> 50:05.872
Janusz!

50:05.958 --> 50:07.789
I saw it I saw it.

50:07.917 --> 50:09.248
I saw the I ake.

50:09.333 --> 50:10.413
Easy, easy.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.910
Three days from here.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.661
Stones! Gather stones!

50:13.750 --> 50:15.206
Heat them in the firel

51:02.708 --> 51:04.164
What is it?

51:05.417 --> 51:07.248
Psst psst

51:07.333 --> 51:10.655
pssst. Hey.

51:14.167 --> 51:16.749
Someone's been following us.

51:16.833 --> 51:20.405
He's behind that dark clump of trees.

51:20.542 --> 51:21.907
If he gives us away,

51:22.042 --> 51:24.875
they'll be all over us in no time.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.833
He's right. We have to do this.

51:27.917 --> 51:28.917
No killing.

51:28.958 --> 51:30.289
No?

51:30.375 --> 51:32.081
I think you've killed before.

51:32.167 --> 51:36.115
You say too many prayers for
an innocent man.

51:36.125 --> 51:37.706
Valka, you go behind

51:37.833 --> 51:39.664
in case he makes a run for it. Go.

51:43.333 --> 51:45.449
Spread out, spread out.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.414
Valka, no.

52:00.500 --> 52:01.706
Nol

52:12.667 --> 52:14.623
We... we won't hurt you.

52:25.458 --> 52:27.915
Huh

52:28.042 --> 52:29.202
a polka.

52:29.333 --> 52:30.914
Polka? What does he want?

52:31.042 --> 52:32.282
I don't know. It's a girl.

52:32.417 --> 52:34.248
And she's Polish.

52:34.375 --> 52:35.990
She's been following us
for several days.

52:36.125 --> 52:37.661
And what?

52:37.792 --> 52:39.472
Well, she needs food,
you know, protection.

52:39.542 --> 52:41.533
She's been too afraid to approach us

52:41.667 --> 52:43.908
until she was sure we weren't Russian.

52:43.958 --> 52:45.368
She wants to travel with us?

52:45.500 --> 52:47.616
She's on the run, like us.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.911
She'll slow us down.

52:50.042 --> 52:52.283
She said she's escaped

52:52.417 --> 52:54.453
from a Russian collective farm.

52:54.583 --> 52:58.405
I know this type... street gypsies.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.537
There are thousands like that,
less use than a dog!

53:01.667 --> 53:06.115
Pakhan, don't do this. Huh?

53:06.250 --> 53:07.911
Oh, come on. She's starving.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.907
We can barely feed ourselves.

53:09.958 --> 53:11.539
Yeah,
maybe it's kinder to leave her.

53:11.667 --> 53:13.703
No, she was sent to us.
We can't leave her

53:13.833 --> 53:17.405
janusz, we have no choice.

53:43.042 --> 53:44.907
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

53:45.000 --> 53:47.161
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

53:52.917 --> 53:54.578
Stay back.

53:54.667 --> 53:56.203
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

53:57.917 --> 54:00.499
Easy. Easy. Easy.

54:03.125 --> 54:05.116
Valka.

54:05.208 --> 54:07.039
Here you are.

54:31.042 --> 54:32.452
Find some wood.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.990
Her name is irena.

55:25.708 --> 55:27.039
Is the soap ready?

55:27.125 --> 55:28.365
Yes.

55:28.458 --> 55:29.868
Ah, good.

55:29.958 --> 55:31.494
Stir.

55:43.917 --> 55:45.077
Well?

55:46.458 --> 55:47.698
What's so funny?

55:47.792 --> 55:49.373
Are you...

55:49.458 --> 55:51.619
You are going to the office
this morning?

56:11.958 --> 56:13.073
Valka?

56:13.167 --> 56:14.202
Valka.

56:14.292 --> 56:15.407
Come on.

56:15.500 --> 56:16.831
You're next. Go, go.

56:16.917 --> 56:19.499
Valka, come on!

56:27.500 --> 56:29.081
Now take off your shirt.

56:31.083 --> 56:33.449
Why do we do this?

56:33.542 --> 56:37.740
So we don't look like
thieves and robbers.

56:37.750 --> 56:40.366
Head up.

56:44.458 --> 56:45.458
Now, still.

56:46.708 --> 56:49.245
Very still, please.

56:49.333 --> 56:50.698
Head up.

56:52.125 --> 56:53.285
More.

56:56.042 --> 56:57.657
Nyet.

57:40.792 --> 57:45.081
You know, I, uh,
can't beiieve she's Polish

57:45.083 --> 57:47.119
she's, uh, she's educated.

57:47.208 --> 57:49.244
Speaks good english, French.

57:49.333 --> 57:50.914
Is that right?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.911
You don't like her, do you?

57:53.000 --> 57:54.581
Speak to valka about her.

57:54.583 --> 57:56.494
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

57:56.583 --> 57:57.789
Well, I did speak to him.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.536
And the others.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.081
They agree she comes with us.

58:03.667 --> 58:05.578
What, you disagree?

58:05.583 --> 58:08.700
There's no room for sentimentality,
you know that.

58:08.792 --> 58:11.659
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

58:40.333 --> 58:42.415
No, it won't take our weight.

58:42.500 --> 58:44.240
We'll have to swim across.

58:48.917 --> 58:50.282
Can you swim?

58:51.375 --> 58:52.785
Yes, mister.

58:52.875 --> 58:54.365
You wouldn't lie to me.

58:54.458 --> 58:55.698
I'm not lying, comrade.

58:55.792 --> 58:57.748
And don't call me comrade.

59:07.042 --> 59:08.077
Irena, no!

59:33.792 --> 59:35.703
Here, come on.

59:42.625 --> 59:44.161
Here, take the food.

59:54.333 --> 59:56.289
Were your parents arrested with you?

59:56.375 --> 59:58.366
They're dead.

59:58.458 --> 01:00:01.245
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:02.948
When the Russians came,

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.578
they said we were kulaks

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.953
and exploiting the peasants.

01:00:07.042 --> 01:00:11.581
My parents were afraid
and hid me in the barn.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.915
I found them later

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.906
I found them face-down in the mud.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.824
They'd been bashed
and strangled with barbed wire.

01:00:43.208 --> 01:00:45.574
Later, the Russians caught me

01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:50.036
and sent me to a collective farm.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:52.537
They were cruel to me.

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:55.241
I ran away.

01:00:55.333 --> 01:00:57.415
I had no food.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.536
And then I saw you.

01:01:07.792 --> 01:01:09.623
You can't swim, can you?

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:14.494
What?

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.309
You've never been near
the water in your life.

01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:18.915
But I got across, didn't I?
And you followed.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:22.239
And you said you lived
on a farm near Warsaw?

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.535
Yes.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.115
Soviets didn't get that far.

01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:29.747
That was German territory.

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:33.200
Your parents weren't murdered,
were they?

01:01:33.292 --> 01:01:35.533
You made all that up.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:42.117
We've all done
terrible things to survives.

01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:48.328
But don't ever lie to me again.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.283
We've had enough of lies.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.956
We have to go around it.

01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:09.283
Quicker through it.

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.240
No, they have dogs.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.745
If they raise the alarm,
then we don't stand a chance

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:15.619
we need food again, pakhan.

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:17.448
Look, I know we need food,

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:19.874
but we can't go into
that town and risk arrest

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:21.368
we're wasting time.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.411
What is it? What's wrong?

01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:41.907
Where's vvalka?

01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:43.407
He was behind zoran.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.616
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:49.781
I'm not his keeper.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.490
Damn him.

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:53.574
He could turn us in for the bounty.

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:54.873
And risk arrest?

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.244
He's a gambler.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:00.530
Irena,
do you think he would do that?

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:01.831
He might.

01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:03.282
We don't need his knife.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.286
We can make one out of deer bone.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:07.491
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:11.956
All right, all right.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:13.623
Come on, let's go.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.915
Watch it funny man?

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.407
Hey, hey, hey!

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.082
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:22.579
Hmm?

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:25.905
Easy, cowboy.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.787
You tear my coat.

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.875
Idiot.

01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:33.405
Idlot? Ha.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.831
Am I?

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:36.748
I et's see who is idiot.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:42.950
What?

01:03:43.042 --> 01:03:44.202
Did I kill?

01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:47.580
Yes.

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:49.073
A dog.

01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:51.909
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.790
But you will, won't you,
because you want to survive.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.740
I know about survive.

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:02.538
All my life.

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.241
And...

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.081
It's my birthday.

01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:10.580
In Russia, that means we drink.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:04.165
She lived in the streets, like me.

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:08.703
So the story you told us wasn't true.

01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:10.748
I thought that story would be more sad

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.619
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:23.697
My parents were Polish communists.

01:05:23.792 --> 01:05:28.365
They took us to live in Soviet union,
to Moscow.

01:05:28.417 --> 01:05:30.999
They want to work for the revolution.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:35.374
We lived in the hotel Lux,

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.572
with lots of foreign communists.

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:45.238
But they arrested them in 1937.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:46.789
They said they were spies.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:52.582
The people pot me in the orphanage.

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:54.203
And my brother,

01:05:54.292 --> 01:05:56.374
he died.

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:58.414
I was ten years old.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.957
They called me rykov,

01:06:06.042 --> 01:06:13.995
but I remembered our Polish name...
Zielinska.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:20.200
I used to say it every night
before I went to sleep.

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.573
So you ran away.

01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:27.122
Oh.

01:06:57.708 --> 01:06:59.289
They have no mosquitoes.

01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:05.498
What can we do?

01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.331
Steal a boat?

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:09.039
No, it's too risky.

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:11.249
People are going to get ill.

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.366
I know.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.206
Isn't it strange?

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:16.823
After all we've faced,

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:20.030
these tiny insects might bring us down.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:32.494
There it is again.

01:07:32.625 --> 01:07:33.990
No mosquitoes!

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.205
Zoran! Zoran!

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:42.870
What's he doing, for god's sake?

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.331
Mosquito repellent.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.741
So what you say to him?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.411
Who?

01:08:09.542 --> 01:08:11.032
The mosquito man.

01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:12.873
Ah.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:14.202
I'm an escaped convict

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:15.573
who is plagued by mosquitoes.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.038
Yeah, very funny.

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:18.493
No, really, what did you say?

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.286
Come on, man.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.332
Clown.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:31.081
Goodbye, lake baikal.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.538
Well done.

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.703
Mister, did you know voss is a priest?

01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:47.408
No, I didn't know that.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.582
And tomasz is a pastry chef,

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.203
but he wants to be an artist.

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:52.868
You don't say.

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:56.154
And zoran was on business in Moscow,

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.161
arrested in red square.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:00.912
He said he was
just taking a photo of the kremlin.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.537
He's an accountant.

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:05.536
Well, I'll be damned.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.533
I never knew a funny accountant.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:12.540
Don't you talk to each other?

01:09:12.625 --> 01:09:16.412
In the camps you learn to say
as little as possible.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.081
Mr. Smith?

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:20.158
Working on the Moscow Metro?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.865
He's an engineer.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.698
His father was Finnish.

01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:27.029
Grew up in America,
but he could speak Russian.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:30.537
And why would an American
move to Russia, for god's sake?

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.203
The depression.

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:34.540
His son came with him.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:38.072
What happened to his son?

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:40.158
They shot him.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.660
He was 17.

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:51.532
The Mongolian border

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:53.331
is on the other side of those tracks...

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:55.032
Maybe four, five days away.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.036
Can we cross somewhere else?

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:58.615
Here, this is the main line.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.539
It's going to be like this everywhere.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:03.375
He's right. We wait till tonight.

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:10.698
What?

01:11:10.792 --> 01:11:12.248
Nothing. Just looking.

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:13.994
Don't look.

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:23.198
Valka?

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:25.283
What?

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:27.661
Why do you have assholes tattooed
on your chest?

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.706
I mean, they should be on your ass

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:32.204
so you can sit on them
every time you take a shit.

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.914
You think it's funny?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.740
They are great men.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.748
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!

01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:42.870
Don't you know what "Stalin" means,
funny man?

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:44.744
Means man-of-steel.

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.869
He takes from rich and gives to poor.

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:49.244
Yes, of course he does.

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:51.369
Then he takes both of them

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.331
and puts them in a gulag for 25 years.

01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:55.658
Watch your eyes, crow bait.

01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:39.200
Thank you, mother Russia,
for your hospitality,

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:41.324
but I will definitely
not be coming back.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:13.538
You know, they'll... they'll catch you.

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:16.537
Yeah. Prison is okay.

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:18.032
Debt is bad.

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:19.706
But there are many prisons,

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:20.948
they don't find me.

01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:26.659
What about America?

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:30.868
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.620
I wouldn't know what to do with it,
I swear to god.

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:43.372
So we must say goodbye, my wolf and me.

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:46.367
You don't need him anymore.

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:55.864
Good luck, valka.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:57.866
Goodbye, janusz.

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.874
Look. See?

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:47.745
Do you think
we'll get there by tonight?

01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:49.414
Yes, I think so.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.331
What will we do?

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:53.533
We will eat.

01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:54.542
Yes.

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.073
We will sleep.

01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:01.993
We made it.

01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:29.282
Mister!

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:36.657
They're communists.

01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.573
So it's here too.

01:15:52.458 --> 01:15:54.744
This changes everything.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:58.990
There's nowhere to hide.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.661
It's a Buddhist temple.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:20.332
They might take us in.

01:16:20.417 --> 01:16:22.874
They might also be
working with the regime.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:25.165
It's a risk.

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:23.870
What happened here?

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:26.412
The same as happened in Russia.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:35.493
Churches closed.

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:40.202
Priests shot or taken to camps...

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:41.823
Religion banned.

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:49.826
They came to my church, in Latvia.

01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:52.124
Destroyed everything, much like this.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.742
I went back later that night,

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:03.495
and there was a lone... lone guard.

01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:07.326
Just a boy.

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:09.203
And I strangled him

01:18:09.292 --> 01:18:12.250
until his eyes
popped right out of his head.

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:25.871
Valka knew somehow.

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:28.412
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:39.823
How far is China?

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.532
I don't know.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:45.868
Maybe five, six hundred
kilometers due south.

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:48.992
600 kilometers?

01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:50.323
Is chlna free?

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:51.577
They're fighting the japs.

01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:52.782
I know that much.

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.740
After China is Tibet.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:57.666
We could go to lhasa, the capital.

01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:14.991
What?
What are you talking about?

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.869
They say we could go beyond Tibet,

01:19:16.958 --> 01:19:18.494
over the mountains to India.

01:19:18.583 --> 01:19:19.583
What mountains?

01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:21.035
The himalayas.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:22.581
Join the British army.

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:24.373
Fight nazls, then fight the Russians.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.367
Go over the himalayas?

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:31.076
How? On a magic carpet?

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.374
How?

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:35.081
We walk.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.250
Careful.

01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:07.457
Come on, wake up.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.541
I was in the middle
of this beautiful dream

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:13.037
I was about to eat some salt

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.161
I almost taste it

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:18.083
I just want to go back to that dream.

01:20:18.167 --> 01:20:19.873
It's a very simple recipe.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.833
You just need two sprigs of Rosemary

01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:24.498
and a pinch of nutmeg.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:27.037
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:29.078
No, we'll... we'll get to that. Now...

01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:30.247
Add the oil...

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:31.573
Mm-hmm.

01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:33.039
And you leave it to marinate

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:34.456
while you prepare the chicken.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:35.288
This is where the salt comes in.

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:36.953
Good.

01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:38.703
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.244
with a little bit of the paprika.

01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:41.869
But double the salt

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.434
look,
you cannot just doubie the sait.

01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:44.914
It'll be too salty then.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.706
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.539
I'm not going to ruin it.

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:50.206
Just double the salt, please.

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:51.664
No.

01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:52.792
Tomasz...

01:20:52.917 --> 01:20:53.917
No.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.309
All right, all right.
Everybody keep calm.

01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:06.789
Oh, my god!

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:09.992
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:12.241
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:19.072
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:20.498
Everybody smile.

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:24.701
Hello. Hello.

01:23:15.417 --> 01:23:16.827
That's south.

01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:53.953
Are we going to eat that?

01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:56.954
It's either this or fish.

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:04.957
It looks like a bird's nest.

01:24:05.042 --> 01:24:07.283
It will protect you from the sun.

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.540
Irena, try this for your feet.

01:25:00.958 --> 01:25:02.664
South.

01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:04.658
Come on, we keep going.

01:25:21.792 --> 01:25:24.283
No, it's another mirage.

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:25.581
We have no water

01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:28.615
there's trees there.

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:32.496
If there's trees, there... there's water.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.865
No, I don't care.

01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:35.823
It's east. We're going south.

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:38.454
But, janusz,
we've got to give it a try.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:40.999
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.285
or you'll kill us all.

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:43.831
Damn it!

01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:47.705
Janusz, we're dying.

01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:49.123
We're already dying.

01:25:49.208 --> 01:25:50.618
Stop.

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:15.744
It's a mirage!

01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:19.119
It's just a mirage.

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:53.287
Mirages don't have birds.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.366
Mirages don't have birds!

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.206
It's a welll

01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:31.662
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

01:29:05.208 --> 01:29:06.994
At least we have water here.

01:29:07.083 --> 01:29:08.869
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.823
Yeah, but no food.

01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:12.828
Maybe nomads
will come to water their flocks

01:29:12.917 --> 01:29:14.623
when?

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:16.619
Next week, next month?

01:29:16.708 --> 01:29:19.450
We should stay here
at least a few more days.

01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:23.364
Look, without food,
we'll only get weaker.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:26.325
And then maybe too weak to travel.

01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:32.704
I don't know. After these last days...

01:29:32.792 --> 01:29:34.874
I don't know if
I can go through that again.

01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:39.164
It was a miracle finding this.

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:42.117
Can we count on another?

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:43.323
Janusz?

01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:51.198
Okay, give me your best.

01:29:57.542 --> 01:29:58.782
Ohh!

01:29:58.875 --> 01:30:00.160
Ah, ha ha!

01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.662
Wait, wait, wait!

01:30:02.667 --> 01:30:03.952
Go, tomasz!

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.331
Hat, please.

01:30:11.958 --> 01:30:13.448
I ower

01:31:22.375 --> 01:31:24.787
Run! Run!

01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:27.161
Get back, get back! Take cover!

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:34.452
Behind that dune!

01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:44.041
Irena! Get down!

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:47.702
Don't be afraid!

01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:05.365
Irena.

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:09.656
Sun-dried fish.

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:11.035
Thank you.

01:32:14.292 --> 01:32:15.498
Here.

01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:30.623
Can you find our way back to the well?

01:32:30.708 --> 01:32:33.541
It was way off course.

01:32:33.625 --> 01:32:36.367
Remember? I mean, way east.

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:37.948
There's no...

01:32:38.042 --> 01:32:40.283
There's no features in this wasteland

01:32:40.375 --> 01:32:42.661
I could never find it.

01:33:13.167 --> 01:33:15.203
When I helped my father in the fields

01:33:15.292 --> 01:33:16.953
during the hot summers,

01:33:17.042 --> 01:33:19.203
we used to suck on
small stones like these.

01:33:19.292 --> 01:33:21.499
Made us feel less thirsty.

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:37.035
Janusz!

01:33:57.958 --> 01:33:59.414
Sunstroke?

01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:08.494
I'm becoming a nuisance.

01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:13.614
No, no, no.

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:16.457
Do they hurt you?

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:20.573
No, not at all.

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:24.030
They must be swelling
because I've walked so far

01:34:26.292 --> 01:34:29.204
don't you think, mister?

01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:30.292
Yes.

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.703
You lie back down now.

01:34:34.792 --> 01:34:36.623
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

01:34:56.875 --> 01:34:59.036
Irena, we can stop for a while.

01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:02.447
No.

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.494
Just suck on this.

01:35:24.042 --> 01:35:26.283
No! Please, no! Nol!

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:29.655
Shh. Shh.

01:35:39.208 --> 01:35:42.200
Come on. We've got to keep going.

01:35:50.792 --> 01:35:52.783
My name is irena zieilnska.

01:35:52.917 --> 01:35:55.659
Shh.

01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:57.657
My name is irena zieilnska.

01:35:57.792 --> 01:35:59.032
Shh, shh, shh.

01:36:17.958 --> 01:36:20.540
Put me on the ground, andrejs.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.082
Just lay me on the ground.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.865
It's okay.

01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:26.993
Command thine angels to receive her

01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:29.620
and to take her to heaven...

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:32.492
Her country.

01:38:32.583 --> 01:38:37.748
Amen.

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.491
I really like this one.

01:41:02.583 --> 01:41:04.289
When did you do that?

01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:06.616
Second night in the gulag.

01:41:06.708 --> 01:41:12.908
Poor kazik,
always in trouble with his feet.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.447
Who is this?

01:41:16.542 --> 01:41:18.328
You.

01:41:18.417 --> 01:41:21.124
Looks like my father.

01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:22.456
Is that how I look now?

01:41:22.542 --> 01:41:23.827
No.

01:41:23.917 --> 01:41:26.454
Now, you look worse.

01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:34.744
You caught her smile.

01:41:37.083 --> 01:41:38.414
L. Ook.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:42.448
This is... just a sketch.

01:41:42.458 --> 01:41:45.291
But I'll work on it.

01:41:45.375 --> 01:41:46.911
I'l do it.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.992
That's really fine work.

01:41:50.083 --> 01:41:55.783
You're a great artist, tomasz.

01:41:55.792 --> 01:41:57.498
It's almost like a photography.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:00.780
It's the shadow.

01:42:00.875 --> 01:42:03.207
It's really nice.

01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:43.745
We have to get to those hills.

01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:47.951
Water may be trapped there.

01:42:47.958 --> 01:42:51.621
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

01:42:56.375 --> 01:42:58.240
Mister

01:42:58.333 --> 01:43:01.166
come on.

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:05.789
Go on without me.

01:43:05.792 --> 01:43:07.373
I'm done.

01:43:11.292 --> 01:43:12.407
Go.

01:43:20.458 --> 01:43:23.746
Zoran.

01:43:23.833 --> 01:43:27.621
You go to the hills and look for water.

01:43:27.625 --> 01:43:29.081
And you wait for us there.

01:43:29.167 --> 01:43:30.167
No.

01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:31.330
Yes.

01:43:31.417 --> 01:43:33.703
We'll catch up.

01:44:11.875 --> 01:44:13.160
Did you find water?

01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:14.365
No.

01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:55.616
Show me.

01:44:55.708 --> 01:44:57.915
Please show me.

01:45:04.083 --> 01:45:05.539
Wwhere...?

01:45:12.458 --> 01:45:13.868
Where are you?

01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:31.833
There's...

01:45:34.167 --> 01:45:35.282
Water!

01:46:13.583 --> 01:46:16.074
Zoran.

01:46:16.167 --> 01:46:17.577
Around here.

01:46:32.417 --> 01:46:34.749
Look at that, uh?

01:46:34.833 --> 01:46:37.119
What if... if it's poisonous?
How can we eat it?

01:46:37.208 --> 01:46:39.244
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

01:46:39.333 --> 01:46:41.824
Here give me the knife.

01:46:41.917 --> 01:46:44.329
Ah, look at that.

01:47:06.917 --> 01:47:08.123
Tastes like chicken.

01:47:08.208 --> 01:47:09.869
Yeah

01:47:09.958 --> 01:47:12.950
a big, black,
poisonous chicken with no legs.

01:47:12.958 --> 01:47:14.619
Well, it's not bad.

01:47:18.125 --> 01:47:22.494
You know,
valka talked of eating each other

01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:24.119
when we were in Siberia.

01:47:26.583 --> 01:47:27.322
He did?

01:47:27.417 --> 01:47:28.827
Yes.

01:47:28.917 --> 01:47:31.704
And? Would you have eaten me?

01:47:31.792 --> 01:47:34.454
Yeah

01:47:34.458 --> 01:47:36.949
yeah, of course.

01:47:36.958 --> 01:47:39.119
I would never have eaten you.

01:47:39.125 --> 01:47:40.740
Well, why not?

01:47:40.833 --> 01:47:42.369
Too stringy and bitter.

01:47:42.458 --> 01:47:44.244
I'd rather eat shake.

01:48:12.125 --> 01:48:13.911
Here's some water

01:48:22.375 --> 01:48:24.616
It can kill you, remember?

01:48:24.625 --> 01:48:25.956
What?

01:48:25.958 --> 01:48:28.791
Kindness.

01:48:28.875 --> 01:48:31.947
How long can you survive
oh mud and snakes?

01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:35.286
Just leave me here.

01:48:39.583 --> 01:48:41.915
You can't, can you?

01:48:49.542 --> 01:48:50.952
Look, mister...

01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:53.124
What?

01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:58.415
You know,
I may not even know your first name,

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.456
but I, uh...

01:49:00.583 --> 01:49:03.040
I know your son's name.

01:49:03.167 --> 01:49:05.954
Irena told you?

01:49:06.042 --> 01:49:07.623
Yes.

01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:13.743
Can I say his name?

01:49:17.042 --> 01:49:18.042
David.

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:25.165
Saying his name won't bring him back.

01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.581
What are you trying to do,

01:49:26.708 --> 01:49:27.788
give me the will to live?

01:49:27.875 --> 01:49:29.285
Is that it?

01:49:29.292 --> 01:49:30.998
Stop me from giving up?

01:49:31.083 --> 01:49:32.789
And are you giving up?

01:49:32.917 --> 01:49:35.374
In the camps,
some saw death as freedom.

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.913
Then why didn't you
just kill yourseif?

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.412
Survival was a kind of protest.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.572
Being alive was my punishment.

01:49:44.667 --> 01:49:46.999
Punishment for what?

01:49:47.083 --> 01:49:49.745
I brought David to Russia.

01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:00.663
And now no one can forgive you.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:03.082
And you can't forgive yourself.

01:50:05.708 --> 01:50:10.202
Irena told me.

01:50:10.333 --> 01:50:12.915
That they tortured your wife...

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:17.665
And she informed on you.

01:50:23.417 --> 01:50:24.873
Yes.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.697
They did the same thing to my boy.

01:50:28.833 --> 01:50:31.666
Then they shot him in the head.

01:50:38.667 --> 01:50:40.498
My wife is alive.

01:50:43.208 --> 01:50:44.789
She lived...

01:50:44.917 --> 01:50:50.742
And was released that much I know.

01:50:50.833 --> 01:50:53.165
But she'll never be able
to forgive herseif

01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:55.957
for what she's done.

01:50:55.958 --> 01:50:59.200
You see, only I can do that.

01:50:59.333 --> 01:51:02.291
She will be torturing herself,
just like you.

01:51:02.417 --> 01:51:06.410
So you see, I have to get back.

01:51:06.542 --> 01:51:09.864
I-have-to-get-back.

01:51:37.042 --> 01:51:38.657
Janusz.

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.123
Pack your things, quick.

01:53:23.583 --> 01:53:25.119
Janusz!

01:54:11.333 --> 01:54:12.743
Do you hear that?

01:54:13.958 --> 01:54:15.038
What is that?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.285
Tibet.

01:55:40.875 --> 01:55:42.206
I hasa.

01:55:48.083 --> 01:55:49.744
And where is India?

01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:52.537
Mmmm.

01:55:56.458 --> 01:55:57.743
India.

01:56:34.125 --> 01:56:36.457
India. Yes.

01:56:36.542 --> 01:56:41.081
There is the track to sikkim,
over the mountains.

01:56:41.167 --> 01:56:43.249
Many people go there.

01:56:43.333 --> 01:56:45.449
Are there villages on the way?

01:56:45.542 --> 01:56:47.578
Small villages, yes.

01:56:47.583 --> 01:56:49.414
They give you food.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.741
Fuel for fire.

01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:54.162
But you can't go now.

01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:55.660
Why?

01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:59.572
If big show comes, very difficult.

01:56:59.583 --> 01:57:03.622
You wait until spring.

01:57:03.708 --> 01:57:05.994
This family keep you.

01:57:11.125 --> 01:57:13.867
Well, we can't cross
the mountains in winter.

01:57:13.958 --> 01:57:16.916
He said it was difficult
but not impossible.

01:57:16.917 --> 01:57:18.623
Janusz, it's only three months.

01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:21.074
Look, we can't let go.

01:57:21.083 --> 01:57:22.823
What do you mean?

01:57:22.917 --> 01:57:26.535
If we stop now, then we'll give
in to exhaustion.

01:57:26.625 --> 01:57:28.741
No, it's not giving in.

01:57:28.833 --> 01:57:32.075
We are exhausted.

01:57:32.083 --> 01:57:34.916
I will sleep till
spring like a bear in a cave.

01:57:34.917 --> 01:57:38.239
You can study buddhism
and become a monk.

01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:42.289
But first you must learn
how to like their tea.

01:57:42.375 --> 01:57:44.707
I already like the tea.

01:57:44.792 --> 01:57:46.077
Good night.

01:57:50.167 --> 01:57:52.078
What about you, mister?

01:57:52.167 --> 01:57:54.954
What are you going to do
for three or four months?

01:57:57.667 --> 01:57:59.578
I'm going to lhasa.

01:57:59.583 --> 01:58:01.539
Our friend has a contact.

01:58:01.625 --> 01:58:03.707
He thinks he can
get me out through China.

01:58:03.792 --> 01:58:08.411
There's a U.S. military mission there.

01:58:08.417 --> 01:58:10.282
Looking out for number one.

01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:12.240
Isn't that what you Americans say?

01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:14.366
Oran...

01:58:14.458 --> 01:58:15.573
Zoran.

01:58:15.583 --> 01:58:16.583
What?

01:58:16.667 --> 01:58:17.747
We escaped.

01:58:20.667 --> 01:58:22.373
We made it.

01:58:24.625 --> 01:58:25.865
You're right.

01:58:25.958 --> 01:58:27.823
He's right.

01:58:27.917 --> 01:58:31.705
Apart from a few mountains,
we are there.

01:58:31.792 --> 01:58:33.703
We made it.

01:58:33.792 --> 01:58:35.578
Not all of us.

01:58:35.667 --> 01:58:38.830
No, not all of us.

01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:45.741
What are you going to do, mister?

01:58:45.833 --> 01:58:47.448
When you go back home.

01:58:47.542 --> 01:58:49.123
Home?

01:58:49.208 --> 01:58:50.573
Build metros?

01:58:50.583 --> 01:58:53.575
Might drift a while.

01:58:53.583 --> 01:58:57.246
I will fight.

01:58:57.333 --> 01:59:02.202
First Germans, then Russians.

01:59:02.292 --> 01:59:03.907
And then?

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.285
Re-build your church?

01:59:05.375 --> 01:59:07.912
No.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.161
I will die fighting.

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:16.412
I'm going to get tomasz'
pictures to a newspaper

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.957
or get them published somehow.

01:59:19.042 --> 01:59:23.581
And then I'm going to cook his chicken

01:59:23.583 --> 01:59:27.622
but with extra salt,
just... just to annoy him.

01:59:30.375 --> 01:59:33.242
And you, janusz?

01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:35.411
As long as the communists
are in Poland,

01:59:35.417 --> 01:59:37.203
you cannot go back.

01:59:37.292 --> 01:59:40.955
They'll shoot you, janusz.

01:59:41.042 --> 01:59:45.911
I'll just, uh... keep going, you know,
until it's over.

01:59:52.833 --> 01:59:54.915
I'll just keep walking.

02:00:11.083 --> 02:00:12.493
He's gone.

02:00:18.583 --> 02:00:22.453
Janusz!

02:01:51.250 --> 02:01:53.536
Namaste.

02:02:08.708 --> 02:02:11.040
Namaste.

02:02:11.125 --> 02:02:12.410
Welcome to India.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.740
Paper passport, please.

02:02:13.833 --> 02:02:16.074
Passport.

02:02:16.083 --> 02:02:17.289
We... we... we don't have.

02:02:17.375 --> 02:02:19.411
Never mind. Come with me.

02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:25.081
Where have you come from?

02:02:25.083 --> 02:02:26.243
Siberia.

02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:27.490
Siberia?

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.536
And how did you come, sir?

02:02:31.625 --> 02:02:33.081
We walked

02:02:33.167 --> 02:02:34.657
walked?
