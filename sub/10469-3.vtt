00:03.629 --> 00:05.626
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:05.851 --> 00:07.926
Look at your community
from the outside.

00:07.927 --> 00:09.964
I can't be outside it and don't want
to be.

00:09.965 --> 00:12.640
You can't be objective, you're not
the right fit.

00:12.641 --> 00:15.237
Anybody's capable of this,
given the circumstances.

00:15.238 --> 00:17.594
No killer behaves normally over
time.

00:17.595 --> 00:20.630
You know people here.
Look for the out of the ordinary.

00:20.631 --> 00:22.548
He was in a boat.
Follow your instincts.

00:22.549 --> 00:25.384
My instinct tells me
the Latimers did not kill their son.

00:25.385 --> 00:28.380
Where were you last night?
I told you, I was on a job.

00:28.381 --> 00:30.178
There was no callout.
I met a mate.

00:30.179 --> 00:32.017
What's your mate's name?
Can't remember.

00:32.048 --> 00:33.067
Sorry?

00:33.166 --> 00:36.679
Danny was killed here. We also found
another set of prints by the sink.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.319
They belong to Mark Latimer.

01:42.676 --> 01:44.713
Hey, mate...

01:46.671 --> 01:48.508
It's all right.

01:49.307 --> 01:51.265
It's all right, I'm here. Come here.

01:51.266 --> 01:52.783
Come here.

01:55.379 --> 01:57.417
There we go, eh.

02:11.038 --> 02:13.077
I'm so sorry, mate.

02:56.021 --> 02:58.058
Am I too rustly?

03:00.455 --> 03:02.393
What's that?
Well, it's freezing.

03:02.445 --> 03:06.360
Long weekend working, big day ahead.
I thought a Thermos would help.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.434
It makes no sense.
What?

03:10.994 --> 03:14.707
The body found at the bottom of
Harbour Cliff. Why move him there?

03:14.708 --> 03:17.783
Why not throw him off here? It's a
good cliff to chuck a body over.

03:17.784 --> 03:20.182
Can you not talk about it like that,
please?

03:21.141 --> 03:23.418
Any boats gone missing recently?

03:25.375 --> 03:27.251
A boat would leave no tracks.

03:27.252 --> 03:31.887
You could moor it on the shore,
leave a body, and the evidence would
be washed away.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.960
What time's Mark Latimer coming in?

03:36.961 --> 03:38.957
Nine.

03:38.958 --> 03:42.990
Sir, I can't believe he's done this.
Many reasons why his prints could be
in that hut.

03:42.991 --> 03:47.666
Look at the evidence in front of
you. Stop behaving like you're his
bloody solicitor.

04:05.963 --> 04:07.999
Just on the loo.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.037
You OK?

04:10.501 --> 04:11.739
Fine.

04:51.408 --> 04:53.165
Well..

04:53.166 --> 04:55.481
You can't say we're not being
thought of.

04:55.482 --> 04:58.197
Look at all this food. It just keeps
on arriving.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.676
What do we do with it all?
I'll take some.

05:00.677 --> 05:02.713
There's some amazing pies.

05:06.309 --> 05:08.823
Mark, you should get going.
They're expecting you.

05:08.824 --> 05:12.978
Why do they want to talk to you,
Dad? Just routine, for them, at
least.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.855
It's all right, it's all right. I'll
be back in two ticks. OK.

05:16.856 --> 05:18.852
Nothing to worry about.

05:23.047 --> 05:25.044
What do we do today?

05:29.718 --> 05:31.756
- Ã£4.79.
- Thanks.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.391
Mr Marshall, right? You run the Sea
Brigade.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.668
Karen White, Daily Herald.

05:38.707 --> 05:40.744
I don't talk to the press.

05:41.623 --> 05:43.660
What, have you got a policy about
it?

05:43.661 --> 05:46.177
I have.
But you're a newsagent.

05:46.736 --> 05:48.734
I sell 'em. I don't want to be in
'em.

05:49.413 --> 05:51.011
Why?
Don't get smart.

05:52.609 --> 05:56.761
I'm just trying to find out about
Danny. He did a newspaper round for
you, didn't he?

05:56.762 --> 06:00.037
Are you gonna leave nicely
or do I have to ring the police?

06:00.038 --> 06:02.516
Well, if you change your mind...
I won't.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.431
Fair enough.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.462
Bloody parasites.

06:12.463 --> 06:13.981
Yeah.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.658
20, is it?
Yeah, thanks.

06:18.016 --> 06:20.133
Brilliant. Yeah, cheers. Bye.

06:27.004 --> 06:29.121
We're all here ready when you are,
sir.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.480
You do it.

06:31.159 --> 06:33.196
I can't... I've never done that.

06:33.197 --> 06:35.114
In you go.

06:35.713 --> 06:37.670
Good morning.
Good morning.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.106
I'm er...

06:40.107 --> 06:41.544
Welcome.

06:41.545 --> 06:44.661
I'm er... Ellie... DS Miller.

06:47.458 --> 06:51.291
So we've got a lot to get through,
we're already behind,

06:51.292 --> 06:54.447
because of the weekend
and not having the resources...

06:54.448 --> 06:56.446
which are here now, which are you.

06:58.044 --> 07:00.201
We just need to hit the ground
running.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.996
Priorities today, house-to-house
enquiries,

07:05.035 --> 07:07.071
CCTV retrieval,

07:07.072 --> 07:09.309
technical data retrieval from
phones,

07:09.310 --> 07:11.347
and alibi follow-ups.

07:11.866 --> 07:15.342
And on top of that, we've had
a lot of information in we need to
sift through.

07:16.141 --> 07:18.178
OK, thank you.

07:25.449 --> 07:26.966
Very inspiring.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.603
Don't ever do that to me again!

07:28.603 --> 07:31.958
Just cos I'm not running to arrest
Mark Latimer, I get thrown to the
lions?

07:31.959 --> 07:34.794
You didn't mention
how we can discount Mark Latimer...

07:34.795 --> 07:37.111
or your own exhaustive list of
suspects.

07:37.112 --> 07:39.510
Don't harangue me! God, you're such
a...

07:41.268 --> 07:45.343
We need to interview your son. We
should have an appropriate adult -
not you, obviously.

07:45.344 --> 07:46.700
Relative, maybe?

07:46.701 --> 07:49.018
Latimer's downstairs. We should
start.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.277
Sorry about yesterday afternoon.

08:05.996 --> 08:09.589
What with everything, I was a little
hazy when you asked me those
questions.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.587
It's more that you tried to lie.

08:11.588 --> 08:13.626
I was just confused, I suppose.

08:14.225 --> 08:16.740
All the days are blending into one,
you know.

08:16.741 --> 08:20.897
The boiler that I said I'd done,
that was Wednesday night. You know
how it is.

08:21.496 --> 08:24.133
And Thursday night, you were with a
mate?

08:24.134 --> 08:25.370
I was, yeah.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.285
But yesterday,
you could not remember their name.

08:28.286 --> 08:30.325
It was Nige, who I work with.
OK.

08:31.763 --> 08:35.118
So you couldn't remember the name of
the man you work with all day?

08:37.875 --> 08:40.312
Just the shock, I suppose, doing
funny things.

08:41.071 --> 08:42.587
We'll check with Nige.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.586
Yeah, you go ahead, El.

08:47.702 --> 08:49.539
You know where this is?

08:49.540 --> 08:52.414
Yeah, that's the rental place on
Briar Cliff, ain't it?

08:52.415 --> 08:55.690
Ever been there? Yeah, I was there a
weekend or two back.

08:55.691 --> 08:59.006
It was a burst pipe. When you say a
weekend or two back -

08:59.007 --> 09:01.044
I dunno, three at the outside.

09:01.045 --> 09:05.677
Nicky, who does our paperwork for
us, she'd have the exact date on the
old invoice.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.114
She's away with the kids this week,
though.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.633
If it's a rental property, who
called you out?

09:11.671 --> 09:13.906
I dunno. This woman.
I can't remember her name.

09:13.907 --> 09:16.625
I picked the keys up from her
at the caravan park.

09:17.584 --> 09:19.379
Just you or your mate Nige?

09:19.380 --> 09:21.496
No, just me. It was an emergency
callout.

09:21.497 --> 09:25.413
They were all worried about
getting the place flooded or
something.

09:25.414 --> 09:27.451
Nige was away with his mum.

09:30.926 --> 09:32.444
Mark, do you own a boat?

09:33.044 --> 09:34.162
Yeah.

09:37.398 --> 09:41.511
A boat, prints at the murder scene
and an alibi made up overnight.

09:41.512 --> 09:45.545
Ask Pete what Mark told Beth about
Thursday night. See if it marries up.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.383
And while we check, Mark stays here.

09:47.384 --> 09:50.099
Know what it'd do to that family,
and town, if it was Mark?

09:50.100 --> 09:53.335
What are you looking for, Miller,
an easy answer to this?

09:53.336 --> 09:55.175
The least pain? It won't work like
that.

09:55.176 --> 09:56.492
I know.
Do you?

09:56.493 --> 09:58.291
Really?

10:01.846 --> 10:04.043
There you go.
Ta.

10:04.723 --> 10:06.720
You're having a right old go at
that.

10:06.721 --> 10:08.716
I have to keep busy.

10:08.717 --> 10:10.755
I hate being shut up in the house.

10:10.756 --> 10:12.432
I like to be out.

10:12.433 --> 10:15.029
Mark says I'm like a dog,
I need walking twice daily.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.699
It's Danny's shampoo,
I keep trying not to look at it.

10:23.698 --> 10:25.735
Do you think I should throw it away?

10:31.049 --> 10:33.085
What happens now?

10:33.086 --> 10:36.120
We gave them a list of suspects.
How far have they got?

10:36.121 --> 10:38.159
They'll tell us when they're ready.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.515
They did ask.

10:41.954 --> 10:43.992
The night before Danny was found.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.228
You and Chloe were in watching TV.

10:49.704 --> 10:51.222
Where was Mark?

10:53.899 --> 10:55.176
He was out.

10:55.177 --> 10:57.694
And he got back...?
I dunno, I was asleep.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.489
He was working?
That's what he said.

11:03.167 --> 11:05.204
But you don't know who for?
No.

11:09.399 --> 11:11.476
OK. Thanks.

11:34.966 --> 11:37.002
There it is, Mark's boat.

11:37.003 --> 11:38.721
Are you all right?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.078
Don't like being on the water.

11:41.717 --> 11:43.355
We're barely on it.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.170
It only needs one.

12:02.171 --> 12:05.486
Minimise the risk of contaminating
the crime scene. Go on.

12:07.044 --> 12:09.202
Can you tell when it was last taken
out?

12:15.793 --> 12:17.550
Oh, shit.

12:17.551 --> 12:19.309
It's blood.

12:39.238 --> 12:40.716
Hiya.

12:46.404 --> 12:47.483
Morning.

12:48.122 --> 12:50.120
Hey, gonna give me a header?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.117
Go on, on my head. I'm ready.

12:52.118 --> 12:53.195
Fine.

12:53.196 --> 12:55.193
You overcompensate.
I know.

12:58.469 --> 13:00.506
Hello!

13:02.024 --> 13:03.661
You woke the dog.

13:03.662 --> 13:05.660
You caught 'em yet?

13:06.379 --> 13:08.615
Those kids ain't safe out there.

13:08.616 --> 13:13.529
Um... it's Mark Latimer that fixed
the burst pipe up at Briar Cliff a
few weekends back?

13:13.530 --> 13:15.167
Not to my memory.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.804
He said he got the keys from you.

13:17.805 --> 13:19.401
No.

13:19.402 --> 13:21.399
Are you sure about that?

13:22.078 --> 13:24.114
We never had a burst pipe up there.

13:24.115 --> 13:26.151
When did you last clean up there?

13:26.152 --> 13:28.870
Ten days ago.
There's been no-one in there since.

13:29.988 --> 13:32.024
Who else has keys to the hut?

13:32.025 --> 13:34.582
Me and the owners. That's it.

13:35.701 --> 13:38.178
We're treating it as a possible
crime scene.

13:39.176 --> 13:41.773
I see. We'll send someone to do
elimination prints.

13:45.808 --> 13:47.805
Have we finished?

13:58.351 --> 14:01.786
By the one-kilometre mark,
Kevin was struggling.

14:01.787 --> 14:05.862
I mean, he's 32 stone,
doing five kilometres cross country.

14:07.340 --> 14:08.978
Every step is a mammoth effort.

14:14.610 --> 14:16.646
Shouldn't Mark be back by now?

14:16.647 --> 14:20.123
It can take ages, this stuff.
But nothing to worry about?

14:21.042 --> 14:22.359
No.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.397
Of course not.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.434
I'm going out.
Where?

14:26.435 --> 14:28.231
Just out.
I'll come with you.

14:28.232 --> 14:30.550
No, Mum, you stay here. I'll be back
later.

15:32.869 --> 15:35.783
Yeah, I was with Mark pretty
much all night.

15:35.784 --> 15:37.783
We met up, had a drive, a bite to
eat.

15:38.782 --> 15:40.617
Do you see him a lot socially?

15:40.618 --> 15:42.936
On and off.
Where did you meet him that night?

15:43.855 --> 15:45.573
The car park by Briar Cliff.

15:45.574 --> 15:47.130
Why there?

15:47.131 --> 15:48.927
Just convenient.

15:48.928 --> 15:50.965
What time did you get home?

15:50.966 --> 15:53.243
One-ish? I dunno, I didn't really
check.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.839
What did you do till one?

15:57.118 --> 15:59.155
Drinking, chatting, bite to eat.

15:59.156 --> 16:01.192
Where did you eat?

16:01.193 --> 16:02.949
A pub in the Vale.
Name?

16:02.950 --> 16:04.948
The Fox.
What did you eat?

16:05.986 --> 16:08.023
Chips and um... and a pie.

16:08.024 --> 16:09.582
A steak pie.

16:12.698 --> 16:14.734
One-ish?

16:14.735 --> 16:17.252
Are a lot of places open that late
round here?

16:17.253 --> 16:19.288
We get lock-ins at The Fox.

16:19.289 --> 16:22.245
Ah. So they'll remember you
when we talk to them?

16:22.246 --> 16:24.282
I would've thought so, yeah.

16:24.283 --> 16:25.721
OK.

16:27.359 --> 16:28.756
OK.

16:28.757 --> 16:31.991
Anything you want to revisit
in what you've just told me?

16:31.992 --> 16:35.147
I don't think so, no.
Nige, want to stop pissing about?

16:35.148 --> 16:38.263
Your mum just said you were in with
her all night till 10:30,

16:38.264 --> 16:41.460
then you went round the corner
for last orders and not with Mark.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.890
Since we talked earlier,
we checked up on a couple of things.

16:49.891 --> 16:55.802
Number one, the woman who holds the
keys to the hut on Briar Cliff...

16:56.401 --> 16:58.357
has no memory of you fixing a burst
pipe.

16:58.358 --> 17:02.314
That's bollocks. I got the keys from
her, I fixed it, I took 'em back.

17:03.112 --> 17:05.628
She has a caravan, she has a dog.
She says not.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.627
Well, she's lying.

17:09.503 --> 17:12.780
Number two. Your alibi is rubbish.

17:14.696 --> 17:16.733
Your mate Nige is not a good liar.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.371
He's not lying, I was with him.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.650
Let's not insult each other's
intelligence.

17:20.651 --> 17:22.685
Your son has been killed.

17:22.686 --> 17:25.643
So I'm at a bit of a loss
as to why you would mislead us.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.160
Why'd you lie, Mark?

17:27.161 --> 17:29.239
Wait, Miller, I haven't done point
three.

17:30.557 --> 17:32.114
Point three.

17:32.115 --> 17:34.112
We had a look at your boat.

17:34.871 --> 17:36.869
And there's bloodstains in it.

17:42.342 --> 17:44.339
Whose blood's in the boat, Mark?

17:46.416 --> 17:47.855
Dan's.

17:50.092 --> 17:52.808
We took the boat out the week before
last.

17:54.087 --> 17:56.123
When we had the hot spell.

17:56.124 --> 18:00.079
It was me, Danny and Chloe,
fishing about a mile offshore.

18:03.075 --> 18:06.149
We caught three sea bass,
we took them back and we barbecued
them.

18:06.150 --> 18:09.027
Danny was messing around on deck,
he caught the...

18:10.066 --> 18:13.941
He caught the end of a line in the
bottom of his foot and gashed it
open.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.215
And he was hopping around
and yelling and screaming.

18:18.894 --> 18:20.812
Chloe was there, so you can ask her.

18:21.811 --> 18:22.969
We will.

18:26.604 --> 18:29.319
Why are you lying about where you
were on Thursday night?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.197
How's this helping find Danny's
killer?

18:31.198 --> 18:33.474
We can't rule you out
till we know where you were.

18:33.475 --> 18:36.110
Everything's becoming part of this,
ain't it?

18:36.111 --> 18:37.868
It's got nothing to do with this.

18:37.869 --> 18:40.824
Everything counts now,
who did what, who was where.

18:40.825 --> 18:42.901
Everything connects and feeds this
case.

18:42.902 --> 18:45.580
If we don't get the truth, we won't
find who killed Danny.

18:45.581 --> 18:47.337
That starts with you.

18:47.338 --> 18:48.816
Just tell us about Thursday.

18:48.817 --> 18:50.852
I've only told you, ain't I?

18:50.853 --> 18:54.207
I told you about the hut, and you're
saying I'm lying and I'm not.

18:54.208 --> 18:58.124
Mark, my son dies, I'd tell a police
officer everything. I just would.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.435
Why did you ask Nigel to invent a
false alibi?

19:03.436 --> 19:07.032
I dunno. Everything I say is getting
twisted. I can't think straight.

19:08.111 --> 19:09.548
All right.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.503
Mark Latimer, I'm arresting you
for obstructing a murder inquiry.

19:12.504 --> 19:15.939
You do not have to say anything but
it may harm your defence if you do
not mention,

19:15.940 --> 19:18.855
when questioned, something
which you later rely on in court.

19:18.856 --> 19:21.971
Anything you do say may be given in
evidence. Is this what you do, El?

19:21.972 --> 19:24.410
Just tell us the truth.
Miller, take his things.

19:34.517 --> 19:36.353
Hiya.
Beth.

19:36.354 --> 19:38.591
We weren't expecting you.
Can I help anyone?

19:38.592 --> 19:40.268
No, we're fine.

19:40.269 --> 19:42.307
Shall I restock the racks, Janet?

19:42.308 --> 19:44.304
They're fine. Yeah.

19:51.694 --> 19:54.451
Hi, Maggie.
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

19:54.452 --> 19:56.287
I'm just coming to work.

19:56.288 --> 19:59.642
Beth, you shouldn't be here.
You've had a terrible thing happen.

19:59.643 --> 20:02.279
I just want to be useful.
Let me get you home.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.795
I've just come from home.
I can't stay in that house.

20:04.796 --> 20:07.152
This isn't the place.
I'll talk to your mum.

20:07.153 --> 20:09.471
I'm not 12, Maggie. I don't wanna go
home.

20:09.472 --> 20:11.188
My heart is breaking...

20:11.189 --> 20:13.187
I don't need bloody broken hearts!

20:28.607 --> 20:30.604
All right, Nige?

20:31.763 --> 20:33.439
Olly! All right, mate.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.596
Never had so many visitors in a day.

20:35.597 --> 20:37.156
Why, who else has been here?

20:37.595 --> 20:39.512
No-one.
OK.

20:39.513 --> 20:41.828
This is Karen from the Daily Herald.
Hi.

20:41.829 --> 20:44.185
Don't think I should be talking to
papers.

20:44.186 --> 20:46.302
She's all right and I'm chaperoning.

20:46.303 --> 20:48.739
Two minutes?
All right, quick, though.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.778
How long have you worked with Mark?

20:50.779 --> 20:52.615
Three years now.

20:52.616 --> 20:55.130
Did my NVQ,
Mark took me on and trained me up.

20:55.131 --> 20:57.447
Everyone says you're the go-to men
in the town.

20:57.448 --> 21:01.524
That's down to Mark. He says, 'Keep
it simple. Life's complicated
enough'.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.560
And the family are close?

21:03.561 --> 21:06.078
Ah, yeah. Always doing something
together.

21:06.079 --> 21:08.115
That's Beth - outdoors girl.

21:08.116 --> 21:10.710
Dragging them up hills,
whether Mark likes it or not.

21:10.711 --> 21:13.469
Compromise is what being married's
all about, I guess.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.466
Nothing's perfect.

21:16.265 --> 21:18.302
And you knew Danny well, obviously.

21:18.303 --> 21:19.661
Yeah.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.576
He used to come out with us
sometimes in the holidays.

21:23.577 --> 21:25.573
He liked to...

21:26.532 --> 21:28.529
Listen, I got a job, I got to go.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.961
Hey, how's your mum now?

21:33.962 --> 21:36.237
Erm... yeah, she's all right.
Yeah?

21:36.238 --> 21:37.917
All sorted now?
Pretty much.

21:57.492 --> 21:59.529
You'll be fine once you get
stuck in.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.366
I don't want to, Dad.

22:01.367 --> 22:04.682
Go and bust some moves before we
have to talk to the police.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.680
Bust some moves?

22:07.679 --> 22:09.715
Down with the kids.

22:09.716 --> 22:10.994
Come on!

22:16.667 --> 22:18.703
Hey, Tom.
All right?

22:18.704 --> 22:20.620
What's this about Danny, then?

22:20.621 --> 22:23.336
Do you know what happened?
Were you with him?

22:23.337 --> 22:25.336
How'd he die?
Was it his dad?

22:48.266 --> 22:50.422
Do you mind if I erm...
No.

22:50.423 --> 22:51.742
Thanks.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.575
I love this view.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.640
Sorry if this is rude, but I know
who you are.

23:09.159 --> 23:10.197
Great.

23:10.198 --> 23:12.595
I can't even imagine what it's like
for you.

23:15.071 --> 23:17.668
You'll get through it.
And you know, do you?

23:20.185 --> 23:21.742
Look, erm...

23:21.743 --> 23:23.740
don't take this the wrong way.

23:24.619 --> 23:26.497
I have a message for you.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.410
It's from Danny.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.766
No, no, no, don't you dare.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.683
I promise you, he just -
Stop speaking to me!

23:36.684 --> 23:38.001
Get away from me!

23:38.002 --> 23:40.718
I'm not trying to upset you, I have
to tell you...

23:40.719 --> 23:42.116
Please!

23:51.138 --> 23:53.414
So you last saw Danny when?

23:53.415 --> 23:55.411
Before we went on holiday.

23:55.412 --> 23:56.849
When was that?

23:56.850 --> 23:59.367
Three and a half weeks ago.
Let Tom speak.

23:59.368 --> 24:01.763
Sorry.
Three and a half weeks ago.

24:01.764 --> 24:03.799
We went on the Thursday morning.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.839
I saw him the afternoon before.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.556
What time?

24:07.557 --> 24:09.753
Straight after school.

24:09.754 --> 24:11.751
And where were you?

24:12.590 --> 24:14.627
He came round, we went to the lido.

24:14.628 --> 24:16.625
Did he have his phone on him?

24:17.663 --> 24:19.700
Don't know.

24:19.701 --> 24:21.698
But Danny had a phone?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.412
Did he say he was worried about
anything?

24:27.451 --> 24:29.009
No.

24:31.645 --> 24:33.682
Did you argue?

24:33.683 --> 24:34.761
No.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.796
Can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt Danny?

24:45.707 --> 24:47.705
How did he get on with his dad?

24:55.215 --> 24:58.571
Anything that you say here
is completely confidential.

25:01.487 --> 25:03.484
He said his dad hit him.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.641
Once?

25:06.680 --> 25:08.677
Maybe twice.

25:09.476 --> 25:10.834
Recently?

25:10.835 --> 25:12.591
I don't know.

25:12.592 --> 25:15.069
He said his dad got into bad moods
sometimes.

25:25.176 --> 25:27.094
OK. All right, thanks.

25:28.412 --> 25:31.486
They want me to tell you... Mark's
been arrested.

25:31.487 --> 25:33.923
And he's refused a solicitor.
What for?

25:33.924 --> 25:37.840
He won't account for his movements
the night before Danny was found.

25:37.841 --> 25:39.916
So he's a suspect?

25:39.917 --> 25:42.112
Let's see where we are once they
finish talking.

25:42.113 --> 25:45.588
You can't just do that - tell us
he's under arrest then nothing else.

25:45.589 --> 25:48.464
I'm sure it'll get sorted. Arrested
isn't charged.

25:48.465 --> 25:51.500
Sorted? My brother's dead -
Chloe, come with me.

25:51.501 --> 25:55.255
Get off me! It's him you should be
having a go at. What are you doing?

25:55.256 --> 25:57.852
Get in the bathroom.
When I say, 'Enough', I mean it.

25:57.853 --> 26:00.371
From now on, you say nothing in
front of Pete.

26:00.372 --> 26:02.806
He is looking at us all the time.

26:02.807 --> 26:04.843
He is not our friend, he is their
spy.

26:04.844 --> 26:06.481
God knows what they're thinking,

26:06.482 --> 26:09.756
but I am not having them going
through our stuff, thinking the
worst.

26:09.757 --> 26:12.713
We have to stay tight,
even just you and me if necessary.

26:12.714 --> 26:15.189
And Dad. It's not him, you don't
think it's him.

26:15.190 --> 26:18.545
You never really know anyone
and we have to be so strong now.

26:18.546 --> 26:22.662
And you have to be older than you
are because I don't know where this
ends.

26:22.663 --> 26:24.179
OK?

26:24.180 --> 26:25.698
OK.

26:42.077 --> 26:43.434
Hey!

26:43.435 --> 26:45.471
How'd it go?

26:45.472 --> 26:47.509
Yeah, he was really brave.

26:47.510 --> 26:49.827
Yeah. Charming, your new boss, ain't
he?

26:49.828 --> 26:51.264
Oh.

26:51.265 --> 26:52.423
Wow.

26:53.302 --> 26:55.300
Oh, I really don't like him.

27:01.571 --> 27:04.126
He's been running the Sea Brigade
for the last 15 years.

27:04.127 --> 27:07.921
What is it, then, Sea Brigade? It's
pretty much Scouts with added boats.

27:07.922 --> 27:11.077
Just lots of lads, resourcefulness
skills, teamwork.

27:11.078 --> 27:13.396
Danny did Sea Brigade, right?
Mm-hm.

27:13.397 --> 27:15.113
And a paper round.

27:15.114 --> 27:17.150
Is he married, this Jack?

27:17.151 --> 27:19.588
We all did Sea Brigade.
But is he married?

27:19.589 --> 27:21.225
Is who married?

27:21.226 --> 27:22.864
Don't mind if I join, do you?

27:24.062 --> 27:28.614
Funny thing, I saw you come in from
across the road but had your boss on
the phone to me.

27:28.615 --> 27:31.531
My boss? Saying he'd been trying you
with no joy.

27:31.532 --> 27:34.529
But he had a hunch you'd make
contact with the local press.

27:36.486 --> 27:39.522
Apparently, you've got AWOL.
In what way?

27:41.009 --> 27:42.566
Karen?

27:42.567 --> 27:44.604
I used to work crime.

27:44.605 --> 27:47.241
At the Herald, there's no money for
reporting, it's all been cut.

27:47.295 --> 27:50.329
We just regurgitate press releases.
I should never have moved.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.209
What's that got to do with you being
here?

27:54.087 --> 27:55.763
Alec Hardy.

27:55.764 --> 27:57.801
I reported on Sandbrook.

27:57.802 --> 28:00.239
I was in court when the case fell
apart.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.714
He failed that family.

28:02.715 --> 28:05.991
I saw it happen and I'm worried
he's gonna do it again here.

28:15.619 --> 28:18.573
You're the last person
I expected a phone call from.

28:18.574 --> 28:21.489
You're the first friendly face I've
seen in months.

28:21.490 --> 28:25.204
If I'm the friendly face, God knows
what the rest of them are like.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.843
Oh, you have no idea. It is another
world.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.036
It's a bit cloak and dagger, Alec,
meeting out here.

28:33.037 --> 28:35.073
What's wrong with the office?

28:35.074 --> 28:38.229
Small town, everyone's eyes on you.
Don't like it.

28:39.588 --> 28:42.664
I uh... went through all the results
you sent me.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.139
So?

28:47.178 --> 28:48.855
It's not good, Alec.

28:48.856 --> 28:50.053
No.

28:50.054 --> 28:52.090
You've got to change all of this.

28:52.091 --> 28:56.126
No stress, no pressure, nothing
that'll cause unnecessary exertion.

28:56.127 --> 28:58.163
I can't.
You have to.

28:58.164 --> 29:02.677
If you don't... you'll end up dead.

29:02.678 --> 29:04.714
Ah, you bloody doctors!

29:04.715 --> 29:07.072
Always, 'Do as I say or you'll end
up dead.'

29:07.073 --> 29:08.509
I'm serious!

29:08.510 --> 29:12.823
Look, I'll make sure all the
paperwork gets filled in. You can be
invalided out.

29:12.824 --> 29:15.701
Not till I'm done here.
You like it that much?

29:15.702 --> 29:17.698
No, I hate it.

29:19.097 --> 29:21.653
I hate the air, I hate the sand.

29:22.652 --> 29:25.207
I hate the stupid people,
I hate the way they work.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.885
I hate their bloody smiley bloody
faces.

29:28.764 --> 29:30.762
I hate the never-ending sky.

29:32.319 --> 29:34.317
Well, why be here at all?

29:40.309 --> 29:42.147
It's penance.

29:43.145 --> 29:44.584
What?

29:45.183 --> 29:47.180
No... really?

29:49.337 --> 29:50.856
Really.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.196
Hi. Am I intruding?

30:36.197 --> 30:38.194
No. Come in.

30:42.828 --> 30:44.826
I just thought I'd see how you were.

30:45.265 --> 30:49.140
I didn't say thank you. You were
nice the other day. Want some wine?

30:50.778 --> 30:52.296
No.

30:53.055 --> 30:56.091
Have you spoken to anyone yet about
the um...

30:56.810 --> 30:58.488
the pregnancy?

30:59.487 --> 31:02.083
Just you. Lucky you!

31:07.157 --> 31:09.192
I've been thinking about Danny.

31:09.193 --> 31:13.668
I know it isn't possible to have a
funeral until the police finish
their investigation,

31:13.669 --> 31:17.663
but we could hold a memorial service
for Danny's life.

31:18.662 --> 31:21.336
A celebration, here, for you, for
the town.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.336
Maybe. I'd have to talk to Mark.

31:25.174 --> 31:27.211
How um... religious would it be?

31:27.212 --> 31:29.167
Whatever you like.

31:29.168 --> 31:31.885
We can plan it so it reflects who
you are...

31:32.524 --> 31:34.082
who Danny was.

31:39.076 --> 31:41.073
Did I say something wrong?

31:42.311 --> 31:43.788
'Was.'

31:43.789 --> 31:45.787
Past tense.

31:47.065 --> 31:49.063
My baby.
I'm so sorry.

31:49.662 --> 31:51.699
I just want to feel him close to me.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.736
I want to hear his voice.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.734
I want to know how he is.

31:59.609 --> 32:01.446
He's with God now...

32:01.447 --> 32:03.283
in the care of the Lord.

32:03.284 --> 32:05.362
Take comfort in that.
Tell God...

32:07.439 --> 32:09.076
give me a signal.

32:09.077 --> 32:10.675
Something.

32:11.274 --> 32:13.271
Let me know he's OK.

32:52.980 --> 32:55.017
I'm under instructions to come in.

32:55.018 --> 32:57.654
Chloe Latimer texted me.
OK.

32:59.372 --> 33:02.528
Thursday night, Mark Latimer was
with me.

33:03.087 --> 33:05.122
We met in the car park and drove
off.

33:05.123 --> 33:06.842
We were together till about one.

33:07.881 --> 33:09.998
Then I dropped him back at the car
park.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.753
Here you go, mate.

33:14.872 --> 33:16.869
This is ridiculous.

33:17.748 --> 33:19.185
Chin up.

33:19.186 --> 33:20.903
What were you doing?

33:20.904 --> 33:22.142
Really?

33:23.980 --> 33:25.977
Having sex.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.610
I know.

33:33.048 --> 33:35.046
Worst decision of my life.

33:39.839 --> 33:41.596
Hello.
I got your note.

33:41.597 --> 33:43.354
Who is it?
Go to bed.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.071
Why? Because I bloody told you to,
that's why!

33:48.268 --> 33:50.066
Sorry, come in.
That's OK.

33:50.067 --> 33:52.064
I'm surprised you called.

33:52.783 --> 33:54.780
Not as surprised as I was.

34:04.138 --> 34:07.354
Why didn't you tell us you were with
Becca Fisher on Thursday night?

34:07.437 --> 34:08.954
Why do you think, El?

34:08.955 --> 34:10.952
You know this town.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.147
If that got out...

34:14.148 --> 34:17.663
You let us pursue this because you
were worried about gossip?

34:17.664 --> 34:19.661
No, not gossip.

34:21.135 --> 34:22.572
Lives, mate.

34:22.572 --> 34:24.609
My family, her business.

34:24.610 --> 34:28.844
You don't understand, you haven't
lived here. You don't know how these
things stick.

34:34.518 --> 34:36.034
Don't tell Beth.

34:36.036 --> 34:38.871
I haven't done anything like this
before, I swear.

34:38.873 --> 34:40.789
With her?
Not with anyone.

34:40.790 --> 34:44.585
I mean, I've had chances, but I've
never done anything before this.

34:46.782 --> 34:48.579
We're tired, though.

34:49.938 --> 34:52.972
You know... I saw a chance of
something else and I took it.

34:52.973 --> 34:56.170
This has only been about Danny's
killer. Why wouldn't you tell us?

34:56.170 --> 34:58.167
Because I'm ashamed, innit?

35:01.523 --> 35:05.637
The one time that I took him for
granted and that's when I lost him
and it...

35:16.943 --> 35:18.940
Please don't tell Beth. Please.

35:35.519 --> 35:37.516
Ooh, that's a lovely cuppa, thanks.

35:40.712 --> 35:42.828
Why did Danny talk to you?

35:42.829 --> 35:44.866
He didn't. He didn't.

35:44.867 --> 35:46.864
I don't...

35:47.543 --> 35:49.541
No, I don't see dead people or...

35:51.258 --> 35:54.174
I have like um... like a spirit
guide.

35:54.175 --> 35:57.291
She tells me things
about people who have passed over.

35:57.292 --> 35:58.829
And over the years,

35:58.914 --> 36:00.950
most have turned out to be true.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.987
So, earlier, I asked her about you.

36:02.988 --> 36:06.744
And she said there was someone...
someone close to you -

36:07.863 --> 36:12.737
a relative with an R or an S in
their name...

36:14.215 --> 36:16.212
trying to come through to you.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.088
Maybe a grandparent or...

36:19.927 --> 36:22.644
or someone who... who played the
piano?

36:24.002 --> 36:26.117
That doesn't mean anything to me.

36:26.118 --> 36:28.876
No? It's OK, wires crossed, that's
no problem.

36:28.877 --> 36:30.474
Erm...

36:34.708 --> 36:36.465
Tell me the message.

36:36.466 --> 36:39.899
I should tell you that I don't
choose what I'm told.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.578
I'm just on the receiving end.
Just tell me.

36:42.579 --> 36:44.016
OK.

36:47.492 --> 36:49.329
Danny wants you to know he's OK.

36:49.330 --> 36:51.366
He's being looked after now.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.004
He says...

36:53.005 --> 36:56.560
don't look for the person who killed
him because it won't help.

36:56.561 --> 36:58.596
He says it won't help.

36:58.597 --> 37:00.595
Because it'll only make you upset.

37:04.070 --> 37:06.787
Because you know the person
who killed him really well.

37:18.651 --> 37:20.849
The hotel owner, do you
believe her?

37:20.850 --> 37:22.445
She's no reason to lie.

37:22.446 --> 37:25.123
Aside from the fact they're sleeping
together.

37:26.961 --> 37:32.314
What if... Danny found out
about Mark and Becca Fisher's affair?

37:33.272 --> 37:36.229
What, so a father kills his own son
to keep him quiet?

37:36.230 --> 37:38.226
You think that's impossible?

37:39.704 --> 37:41.422
I don't know.

38:05.111 --> 38:06.909
I'm home.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.864
Hey, you all right?

38:09.865 --> 38:11.024
Mm.

38:11.903 --> 38:13.939
Pete said you were arrested.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.937
Yeah, they got their wires crossed.

38:17.216 --> 38:19.213
It's fine, all fine.

38:19.932 --> 38:21.770
Come here.

38:38.748 --> 38:41.702
I'll be home soon.
How's Tom? Have you talked to him?

38:41.703 --> 38:45.337
Yeah. He asked whether you thought
he'd done it to Danny.

38:45.338 --> 38:47.694
I hope you told him I didn't.
Yeah.

38:47.695 --> 38:50.533
Then he asked why you were
the police person looking into it.

38:50.534 --> 38:52.569
Well, we're all asking that.

38:52.570 --> 38:54.606
Anyway, how's the boss?

38:54.607 --> 38:56.483
Same, as if it wasn't hard enough.

38:56.484 --> 38:58.521
Smother him with kindness, El.

38:58.522 --> 39:00.520
Isn't that your usual way?

39:02.158 --> 39:03.994
El? Hello?

39:03.995 --> 39:06.031
Are you still there?

39:06.032 --> 39:08.628
Yeah.
Come home soon.

39:08.629 --> 39:11.784
Wake me up.
You'll regret it.

39:11.785 --> 39:14.660
Never have before. Love you.

39:14.661 --> 39:16.659
Quite right. Love you too.

39:24.329 --> 39:27.445
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt Danny?

39:30.441 --> 39:32.476
How does he get on with his dad?

39:32.477 --> 39:35.834
Anything you say here is absolutely
confidential.

39:36.513 --> 39:38.151
He said his dad hit him.

39:39.589 --> 39:41.027
Once?

39:41.866 --> 39:43.864
Maybe twice.

39:44.902 --> 39:46.300
Miller?

39:48.737 --> 39:51.372
Reconstruction, Thursday night, one
week on.

39:51.373 --> 39:53.369
Your boy Tom, he should do it.

39:53.370 --> 39:56.405
What? No, I don't want him to.
He's the best choice.

39:56.406 --> 39:59.921
Did you not hear me? He's lost his
best friend, that could traumatise
him.

39:59.922 --> 40:02.797
Maybe he should be allowed to
decide. I'm his mum, I decide.

40:02.798 --> 40:06.113
So your commitment to this
investigation stops outside these
doors?

40:06.114 --> 40:09.710
Sir, move away from me now or I will
piss in a cup and throw it at you.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.307
Talk to...

40:11.308 --> 40:15.023
What's your husband's name - Joe?
Talk to him about it. And Tom.

40:15.662 --> 40:17.340
You're invited for dinner.

40:18.059 --> 40:19.377
What?

40:19.378 --> 40:21.375
Pick a night.

40:21.894 --> 40:23.931
At your house? Why?

40:23.932 --> 40:26.207
Do you know many people here?
No.

40:26.208 --> 40:29.043
Are you living off hotel food?
It's not a good idea.

40:29.044 --> 40:32.800
Don't be an asshole about it, I
don't want to do it either, but it's
what people do.

40:32.801 --> 40:34.118
Is it?

40:34.119 --> 40:36.513
They have the boss round
and don't talk about work.

40:36.514 --> 40:39.472
What will we talk about?
I don't know! Just say yes.

40:41.110 --> 40:42.387
Yeah.

40:42.388 --> 40:44.385
Thank you. Bloody hell!

40:47.901 --> 40:49.299
Knob.

40:58.327 --> 41:00.365
Did you tell them where you were?

41:00.366 --> 41:02.003
Yeah.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.036
Are you gonna tell me?

41:06.037 --> 41:07.875
Not now.

41:12.269 --> 41:14.267
Look at me.

41:24.533 --> 41:26.531
Did you kill him?

41:27.410 --> 41:29.446
What?
Did you kill Danny?

41:29.447 --> 41:31.444
How could you even say that, Beth?

41:32.124 --> 41:35.637
Is that what you think? Is that what
you see when you look at me?

41:35.638 --> 41:38.435
All you have to say is no.
How can you even say it?

41:40.872 --> 41:43.069
You think I could kill my own son,
do you?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.545
Do you?

41:45.546 --> 41:47.663
You think I could strangle him, do
you?

41:50.700 --> 41:54.215
For God's sake, Beth. What in God's
name is happening to us, eh?

42:15.028 --> 42:17.064
What time do you call this?

42:17.065 --> 42:18.582
No.

42:18.583 --> 42:23.455
Come on, five minutes. Couple of
quotes, tell me where you've been,
what you've been up to.

42:23.456 --> 42:25.493
After what you did to me last time?

42:25.494 --> 42:28.409
Legitimate investigation.
You turned me over.

42:28.410 --> 42:31.964
You will never have anything out of
me as long as I am breathing.

42:31.965 --> 42:34.880
You let that family down.
I sat with them after the trial.

42:34.881 --> 42:38.997
They still don't have closure
because of you and I won't let you
do that to another family.

42:50.223 --> 42:51.741
Hey.
Hey.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.776
You didn't have to tell them.

42:54.777 --> 42:56.774
Got you out.
Yeah.

42:58.332 --> 42:59.810
Thanks.

43:02.287 --> 43:04.323
Last Thursday... us.

43:04.324 --> 43:05.921
It was a mistake.

43:05.922 --> 43:08.838
Not for me, it wasn't.
If it wasn't, then it is now.

43:10.396 --> 43:11.914
Yeah, I know.

43:14.671 --> 43:16.108
Timing.

43:16.109 --> 43:18.106
Might have had something.

43:18.985 --> 43:21.022
We still could.

43:21.023 --> 43:22.500
No.

43:22.501 --> 43:24.337
It don't change anything.

43:24.338 --> 43:26.056
It changes everything.

43:44.952 --> 43:46.590
I think...

43:49.066 --> 43:52.542
it may have been punishment for
something, for what we did.

44:10.279 --> 44:11.877
Go home.
