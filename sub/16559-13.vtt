00:03.210 --> 00:04.250
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:04.250 --> 00:06.620
Somebody killed him,
burned his body,

00:06.620 --> 00:08.210
and misplaced it!

00:08.210 --> 00:09.380
-We're gonna find it.
-You better.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.960
Otherwise, you're
gonna have a lot of people

00:10.960 --> 00:12.170
thinking there's
a conspiracy going on.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.790
Say something else
about my boys.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.000
You didn't just neglect them.
You molested them.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.710
It looks worse than it feels.

00:17.710 --> 00:18.960
They hurt you.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.040
I erased
Annalise's phone that night.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.120
I know.
Yeah, but I saved a copy.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.210
If you have
anything to say,

00:24.210 --> 00:25.580
you need to say it
through your lawyer.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.920
I fired the guy.
I'm gonna represent myself.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.830
Someone signed off
on having his body transferred

00:29.830 --> 00:31.120
to another morgue.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.750
Who is it?
You.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.670
Hey.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.830
Hey.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.120
Hello?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.580
Hey.

01:39.580 --> 01:41.830
Damn.

01:41.830 --> 01:45.750
Yeah, they got me
pretty good.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.120
Atwood's targeting me,
too.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.710
My signature ended up
on the form

01:54.710 --> 01:56.120
to transfer Wes' body.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.250
You sure it's her?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.080
Yeah, I was asking
too many questions.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.620
You need to go to Denver,
tell him.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.460
I know.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.000
I'm just not sure
that's all they got on me.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.330
Nate?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.290
I was at your house
that night.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.960
Hey.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.620
Annalise up there?

02:25.620 --> 02:27.620
No.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.880
Door was open.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.170
The detectives let you go?

02:33.170 --> 02:35.330
You're in on this.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.420
No.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.880
You should take the deal
they're offering.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.460
They're gonna take her down
eventually.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.960
For what?

02:50.960 --> 02:55.210
Sinclair, Sam,
framing me.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.960
You sure you want to go down
for all that?

02:56.960 --> 03:00.580
She chooses herself
every time.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.080
You're wrong.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.380
I've been in your place,
thinking you owe her things.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.920
I just need to talk
to her.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.620
So she can play you again?
She knew my mother.

03:08.290 --> 03:10.170
He said you were
looking out for him...

03:10.170 --> 03:13.500
ever since
he was a kid...

03:16.830 --> 03:20.540
...got him
into law school.

03:20.540 --> 03:23.040
She's not who people
make her out to be.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.040
Of course she is.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.880
Then why has she protected me
even when I didn't deserve it?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.420
What's that mean?

03:31.420 --> 03:34.920
I've done
awful things to her.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.040
Like...?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.670
Wes.
Leave.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.210
Lahey here.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.380
Gibbins walked out on us.
You know anything about that?

03:56.380 --> 03:58.040
Why would I?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.830
You were standing outside
of his interrogation room

03:59.830 --> 04:01.000
the last time I saw you,
so...

04:04.620 --> 04:06.620
I don't know where he is.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.420
I left him there.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.920
If anybody
checks my phone,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.500
they'll see I was
at the house that night.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.580
Thank you for telling me.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.580
Stop.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.080
You didn't
have to do that.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.920
He died
'cause I left him there.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.580
Don't thank me
for anything.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.750
We'll fix this.

04:45.330 --> 04:48.170
I promise you.

04:48.170 --> 04:49.170
We're gonna fix it.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.670
Thank you all for coming.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.290
I know you didn't have to.

05:07.290 --> 05:11.460
You could have just...
run off to Brazil already.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.830
Is that really
an option?

05:19.960 --> 05:23.040
I failed.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.210
I promised to protect you all,
and I didn't.

05:26.210 --> 05:28.420
I tried, but...

05:28.420 --> 05:31.460
the D.A. offered Wes immunity.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.250
It would make sense
to come to you next.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.580
AK, come on.
You know we all have your back.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.210
We don't know that.

05:40.210 --> 05:43.040
The D.A. really wants to
take me down for this.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.620
And I would imagine
that anything that they offered

05:46.620 --> 05:47.460
would be hard to turn down.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.000
Oh, my God.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.080
I'm sorry.
Did you really call us here

05:51.080 --> 05:53.040
to beg us not to
tattle on you?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.420
No. And I'm sorry
if it's coming off that way.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.790
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.210
Laurel, please,
just sit down.

05:59.210 --> 06:00.420
Why aren't we talking
about going after

06:00.420 --> 06:01.750
the people who killed Wes?

06:01.750 --> 06:03.040
We don't know
who killed him.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.000
He testified
against Charles Mahoney

06:05.000 --> 06:06.460
a week before he died.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.960
It's not that simple.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.580
It is...
and we should do something.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.540
These people
are dangerous.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.500
So what -- we're just
gonna sit around

06:12.500 --> 06:14.080
and act weak and victim-y?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.420
No one's acting like
a victim.

06:15.420 --> 06:18.210
You are.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.750
Have you said your peace?
Can I go?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.040
Hack it.

06:33.710 --> 06:34.710
You hack it.

06:34.710 --> 06:37.080
I don't know how,
obviously.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.960
Well, then,
there's your answer.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.920
Oliver, what if
she's hiding something?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.080
Then I think we should
respect her wishes,

06:42.080 --> 06:43.880
and let it stay hidden.

06:46.210 --> 06:49.040
Is that why you
saved a copy?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.210
Because I think you did
because your gut's telling you

06:51.210 --> 06:53.040
that Annalise is
being sketchy.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.920
You didn't see her that night.
She was a wreck.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.670
Maybe 'cause she killed Wes.
Have you ever considered that?

06:59.670 --> 07:02.080
You don't really believe that,
do you?

07:02.080 --> 07:03.460
I don't know
what I believe.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.080
That's why I'm asking you

07:05.080 --> 07:06.670
to go through
what was on her phone.

07:06.670 --> 07:08.500
If we don't find anything,
great.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.710
I have to look
for a new job

07:09.710 --> 07:11.540
now that Annalise is
pretty much fired.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.830
Otherwise, we're both gonna be
sleeping on Michaela's couch.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.290
Well, you're not gonna need
a job when the police find out

07:15.290 --> 07:17.040
you're sitting on
illegally-obtained evidence.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.620
What if we found out
something terrible?

07:21.620 --> 07:23.040
I'd rather stay
blissfully ignorant.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.210
This isn't about us, Oliver.
It's about Wes.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.420
If Annalise had anything to do
with him dying

07:30.420 --> 07:33.420
a horrible, horrible death,

07:33.420 --> 07:35.920
then the world
needs to know that.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.290
Hopefully, there's
a Nate peen pic on here,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.000
or something.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.830
There's this case in Missouri.
It was a gang shooting.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.210
They had
three defendants charged

07:54.210 --> 07:56.540
with second-degree murder,
until the police lost the body.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.710
Judge threw out
the whole case.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.880
They lost the body

07:58.880 --> 08:00.540
before the M.E. did an autopsy
in that case.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.750
So we file some motion
about them hiding evidence.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.120
That's not how this works.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.670
Why not?

08:06.670 --> 08:08.710
The fact
that you don't know

08:08.710 --> 08:11.710
is exactly why you should
re-hire you lawyer.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.920
Did you just imply
I'm stupid?

08:15.920 --> 08:18.040
You're acting stupid.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.880
Even the fact
that we're meeting here.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.540
It makes it look like
you and Annalise are colluding,

08:21.540 --> 08:24.670
which is...
maybe what you want.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.880
What's that
supposed to mean?

08:26.880 --> 08:29.460
I told you to go look
for Wes at the house.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.880
The next thing I hear...
he's dead.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.500
He wasn't at the house
when I got there.

08:37.540 --> 08:40.000
I'm innocent.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.120
Call your lawyer,

08:46.120 --> 08:47.920
hire him back.
Not gonna happen.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
Wait!

08:51.290 --> 08:52.580
How's everyone doing?

08:52.580 --> 08:55.380
Laurel's fine.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.250
No! That's not -- Bon!

09:16.000 --> 09:19.750
Atwood's targeting me, too.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.080
My signature ended up
on the form

09:21.080 --> 09:22.710
to transfer Wes' body.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.580
We'll fix this.

09:24.580 --> 09:29.540
We're just gonna sit around
and act weak and victim-y?

09:29.540 --> 09:32.330
"Attention,
Ingrid Peters, Esquire.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.000
Pennsylvania Office
of the Deputy Attorney General.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.790
My name is Annalise Keating,
and this is a demand letter

09:37.790 --> 09:39.790
seeking a grand-jury
investigation

09:39.790 --> 09:42.120
into a conspiracy
launched against me

09:42.120 --> 09:44.040
by the Philadelphia
District Attorney's Office."

09:48.120 --> 09:49.120
Howard?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
Call me "Howie."

09:50.120 --> 09:51.960
Got it.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.380
"This letter serves
as a formal complaint

09:57.380 --> 10:00.540
in petition for investigation

10:00.540 --> 10:03.710
committed
by A.D.A. Renee Atwood.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.920
The following is a list
of her unlawful actions.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.080
Acting on personal bias
and false information,

10:09.080 --> 10:11.880
Ms. Atwood arrested and held me
without probable cause,

10:11.880 --> 10:13.830
just by the confession
by a career criminal,

10:13.830 --> 10:15.000
Frank Delfino."

10:15.000 --> 10:16.830
You know,
this is a big case.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.620
Well, that's why
I'm paying you big bucks.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.250
"A.D.A. Atwood orchestrated

10:20.250 --> 10:22.250
the disappearance
of the victim's body,

10:22.250 --> 10:23.830
thereby tampering with evidence

10:23.830 --> 10:26.420
and obstructing a fair
and impartial trial."

10:26.420 --> 10:29.040
What do you think?

10:29.040 --> 10:30.040
It's war.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.580
Exactly.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.250
"I demand you launch

10:35.250 --> 10:36.920
an immediate grand-jury
investigation

10:36.920 --> 10:38.710
into A.D.A. Atwood.

10:38.710 --> 10:39.750
If no action is taken..."

10:39.750 --> 10:40.960
"...I will
personally see to it

10:40.960 --> 10:42.380
that the corruption
in this office

10:42.380 --> 10:45.170
is publicly
and irreparably exposed."

10:45.170 --> 10:46.750
These are big claims.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.290
I was left
with no other choice.

10:48.290 --> 10:49.830
Actually, there are
a lot of other choices

10:49.830 --> 10:51.380
besides invoking
the power of the State.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.750
I know my legal options.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.170
I also know
how important it is

10:54.170 --> 10:55.790
for the
Attorney General's Office

10:55.790 --> 10:58.580
to investigate any charges
of prosecutorial misconduct.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.830
Please, if every
criminal in the state

10:59.830 --> 11:01.670
was allowed to file suit
because their D.A. was being

11:01.670 --> 11:03.920
a little overzealous --
Look at my face.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.120
Do you not think
this constitutes a lawsuit?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.330
I'm sorry.
Are you now claiming

11:07.330 --> 11:08.830
A.D.A. Atwood
physically assaulted you?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.120
Worse!

11:10.120 --> 11:11.540
She disappeared
a young man's body

11:11.540 --> 11:12.960
in order to frame me
for murder.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.080
Please do not
raise your voice.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.290
Can you imagine
what would happen

11:15.290 --> 11:16.920
if this got slipped
to the press?

11:16.920 --> 11:19.500
The corruption scandal that
would follow your whole career?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.880
There goes any chance at a
judgeship or congressional seat.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.170
Is that what you want?

11:23.170 --> 11:25.620
This office does not
tolerate threats.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.290
Find that body.

11:28.290 --> 11:31.620
Otherwise,
it won't just be a threat.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.040
I will not stand by
and let baseless accusations

11:38.040 --> 11:39.420
be leveled
at any of my prosecutors.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.670
And I won't stand by while you
frame my client for murder.

11:41.670 --> 11:44.500
You think Ingrid Peters
is gonna take

11:44.500 --> 11:46.460
Keating's accusations
seriously?

11:46.460 --> 11:49.120
She better. Otherwise,
we'll take it to the FBI.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.120
There are bodies piling up
around this woman,

11:51.120 --> 11:53.120
and you think
she deserves justice?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.620
Renee...
Excuse me?

11:54.620 --> 11:56.580
What about that poor young man
who was burnt to a crisp?

11:56.580 --> 11:57.500
Where's his justice?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.750
We'll see you
at the grand jury.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.330
We can hit you back,
Ms. Winterbottom.

12:05.330 --> 12:08.040
This office has files on
everyone in Ms. Keating's life.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.040
You, her students...

12:11.040 --> 12:14.710
Are you really sure
you want to go down this road?

12:16.500 --> 12:19.080
We're already there.

12:28.830 --> 12:32.040
They'll probably offer us
the same deal as Wes.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.040
I mean, we know everything
that he did.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.420
Dude, shut up.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.420
I will go Red Wedding
on anyone who rats out Annalise.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.000
Even Laurel,
because where is she?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.120
She seemed pissed enough
to go get herself a deal.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
She's at home...grieving.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.290
So she's at the police station.
Dude, the D.A. would have
already come to us

12:47.290 --> 12:48.460
if they wanted
to offer us a deal.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.120
Mm, that's not true.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.540
Okay, we've been back at school
for five minutes.

12:51.540 --> 12:52.920
Can we at least pretend
to study?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.250
So why haven't
they approached us yet?

12:54.250 --> 12:56.460
A million reasons,
especially if this is a...

12:56.460 --> 12:58.670
...conspiracy,
like Annalise claims it is.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.710
Stop talking.
Annalise was closer to Wes
than any of us.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.460
Maybe it was
a crime of passion, or --

13:02.460 --> 13:06.080
I said to stop talking.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.250
Oh, my God, do you think
she has this room bugged?

13:10.710 --> 13:12.080
Hello?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.210
I can't make Laurel
not be mad at you.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.330
She gets to be mad
right now,

13:20.330 --> 13:21.710
and whatever other emotions
she's feeling.

13:21.710 --> 13:24.540
It's called the grief process,
so don't try and trick me

13:24.540 --> 13:26.170
into making you two besties
or something.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.960
That's not why
I called you here.
Of course it is.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.960
Can I just speak?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.790
I know you, Annalise,
and, yes,

13:30.790 --> 13:32.580
I just called you Annalise,
which I think is appropriate,

13:32.580 --> 13:34.170
considering where we are
in our relationship.

13:34.170 --> 13:35.710
You can call me
whatever you want.

13:35.710 --> 13:39.080
I just did.
And frankly...

13:39.080 --> 13:41.250
I am your biggest advocate
right now.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.880
So just admit
what you need

13:42.880 --> 13:44.670
rather than
whatever game this is.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.290
You're right.

13:46.290 --> 13:49.120
Okay? You're right.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.290
Bonnie said you've been
holding everyone up.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.920
That doesn't surprise me.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.420
I'm just...sorry
that you're in this position.

13:58.420 --> 14:02.120
But it is what it is
right now.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.290
You're the one
they listen to, so...

14:07.380 --> 14:08.960
I'm just asking
if there's anyone

14:08.960 --> 14:12.080
I need to be
worried about right now.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.620
Everyone's fine.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.540
You sure?

14:18.540 --> 14:20.000
Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.210
Because
like you just said,

14:22.210 --> 14:23.790
I've been cleaning up
all your mess

14:23.790 --> 14:25.210
while you've been in jail.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.330
Is that all?

14:29.330 --> 14:31.580
Okay.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.500
So, you admit
that's your signature?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.080
Yes.
But you didn't sign it?

14:43.080 --> 14:45.120
Nope.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.500
So you think someone
who had access to your signature

14:47.500 --> 14:49.290
forged this?
Seems that way.

14:49.290 --> 14:51.420
Do you have theories
about who forged it?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.080
Can't say.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.290
You got the State involved?!

14:58.290 --> 15:00.670
I told them
to look into Atwood.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.830
Well, now she's looking into me.
Your signature is on that form.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.790
You were gonna
be investigated either way.

15:04.790 --> 15:06.750
Not by the State!

15:06.750 --> 15:08.170
You seriously think
this lady's

15:08.170 --> 15:09.790
gonna charge
her own prosecutor?

15:09.790 --> 15:12.210
She will once she finds out
they're setting you up.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.460
If she finds out! We don't know
how high this goes!

15:14.460 --> 15:16.040
Nate --
These people
only protect their own.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.960
I know these people,
how to manage them.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.960
Maybe before...but they think
you're a joke now.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.210
Stop trying to help me.

15:26.210 --> 15:29.960
It only
makes things worse.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.710
We could
pull the complaint.

15:37.710 --> 15:39.500
No.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.210
Find out where Oliver is.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.380
Mind if I come in?

15:54.380 --> 15:57.080
Of course not.
Yeah.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.880
Connor told me
you got out on bail,

16:03.880 --> 16:07.250
which I guess is cause
for congratulations.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.040
Or something.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.920
Is everything okay?

16:16.210 --> 16:18.210
That depends.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.750
On...?

16:20.750 --> 16:23.710
If we're still good.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.040
"Good"?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.750
Well, a lot has changed
since we last spoke.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.250
Yeah, well, not for me.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.750
Well,
let me just say this --

16:31.750 --> 16:34.750
Oliver...there's no reason
for you to protect me.

16:34.750 --> 16:39.040
We both know that...
but you've been very steady.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.920
And it means a lot to me,
especially right now.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.080
It means a lot to me,
too.

16:49.120 --> 16:54.580
So...is it
the D.A.'s Office again?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.710
You need me to do a little
hacky McHackerson for you?

16:56.710 --> 17:00.500
It's easier than that.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.830
Janice said
you needed me?

17:07.830 --> 17:09.670
Look.

17:11.620 --> 17:14.040
This bitch.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.670
I'm no joke.

17:27.330 --> 17:28.460
Castillo!

17:28.460 --> 17:30.080
Open the door,
or I'll call your landlord.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.830
Hey. We brought, uh,
cookies.

17:33.830 --> 17:36.000
Oh, I'm not hungry.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.210
Everyone's hungry
for dessert.

17:38.210 --> 17:41.380
Come on. Yummy, yummy, yummy
in your tummy, tummy, tummy.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.750
Who's in there?

17:42.750 --> 17:44.120
Uh, no one.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.540
Michaela!

17:47.540 --> 17:50.120
Who are you?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.120
Uh...a friend.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.620
I'll be in touch.

17:58.580 --> 18:01.500
Wait, are you banging that dude?
No.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.880
Banging him is fine.
Doing other things is not.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.290
Who is he?

18:05.290 --> 18:07.460
Private investigator.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.500
Are you a moron?
What, like "Veronica Mars"?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.290
Before you yell at me...
look at what he found.

18:12.290 --> 18:17.040
Sylvia Mahoney submitted DNA
to a lab for analysis

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
five days before Wes' death.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.210
So? My whole family
had that done.

18:20.210 --> 18:22.000
Actually, I found out
that I have some Japanese

18:22.000 --> 18:24.250
in my genes.
She did the DNA test
on Wes, idiot.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.790
They must have found out
he was Wallace's son.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.580
That's why they killed him.

18:35.710 --> 18:36.960
Hello?

18:36.960 --> 18:40.330
Annalise. Hi.
So, it's true?

18:40.330 --> 18:43.120
You got out on bail?
Yeah.

18:44.830 --> 18:46.420
That's great.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.460
Isn't it?

18:49.460 --> 18:53.250
Of course. I'm relieved.
Everything okay?

18:53.250 --> 18:55.080
Yes, everything's fine.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.040
I just called
the minute I heard.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.620
The Board's nervous,
right?

19:00.620 --> 19:02.040
What?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.960
They think I'm gonna ask
to go back to work.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.750
Tell them to relax.
I know I'm fired.
No.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.120
I'm crazy, but I'm not so crazy
to think that they'd let me

19:09.120 --> 19:11.290
within 100 yards
of that campus.

19:11.290 --> 19:15.620
Look, just don't think
about any of that right now.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.460
You're out of jail.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.040
And that's a great thing,
so...do you need anything --

19:21.040 --> 19:24.210
clothes,
help finding a place to stay?

19:24.210 --> 19:26.830
No, I'm good.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.620
I actually have an appointment
about to start, so...

19:29.620 --> 19:32.040
Oh, okay.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.040
Just call me
if you need anything...

19:35.040 --> 19:37.750
or if you want to go
to a meeting.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.170
I will.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.580
Talk.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.170
Laurel hired
a private investigator.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.170
He found this.

20:03.170 --> 20:06.170
The Mahoneys
ran a DNA test on Wes.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.460
They knew who he was.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.670
Possibly.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.540
You're just like Wes.
You dig when I tell you not to.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.120
You ask questions about things
you can't understand.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.170
This proves
they killed Wes.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.000
No, what it proves is,
you don't listen.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.380
What did I tell you
about these people?
Tell me what I said.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.120
This could mean that Atwood
is working with the Mahoneys

20:25.120 --> 20:26.170
to frame you.

20:26.170 --> 20:27.790
You could take this
to the police.

20:27.790 --> 20:30.580
The police who are
trying to set me up?
You can at least try.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.960
These people
will hurt us, all of us.
That's what they did to me.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.790
I was pregnant, eight months,
and they murdered my baby.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.250
I was just like you...

20:49.250 --> 20:50.830
just trying to do
the right thing,

20:50.830 --> 20:54.040
stood up to them...

20:56.460 --> 20:58.670
...and they destroyed
my life.

21:03.420 --> 21:09.210
We have to do whatever it takes
to stay safe.

21:09.210 --> 21:13.830
That's what's important
right now.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.920
Wes deserved
so much better than you.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.750
Hi. Um...

22:32.750 --> 22:34.420
Laurel didn't mean that.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.920
Yes, she did.
But that's all right.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.580
I'm sorry
about your baby.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.540
And, uh...Wes, too.

22:43.540 --> 22:45.170
I...

22:45.170 --> 22:46.750
I know how close
you both were,

22:46.750 --> 22:49.960
and...this all...

22:49.960 --> 22:52.790
this all just really...
sucks.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.790
Anyway, maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.210
I-I just want to
let you know

22:58.210 --> 23:00.210
that I haven't forgotten
about what you did for me.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.620
Asher.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.540
Yeah?

23:03.540 --> 23:06.750
You don't need
to worry about me.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.080
Yeah,
you should listen to her.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.330
Worry about Laurel,

23:14.330 --> 23:16.330
the D.A.'s Office
coming after us, not Annalise.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.960
She's a human being.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.080
At the very least,
she deserves our sympathy.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.080
Oh.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.710
Say, "She's a human
and deserves our sympathy."

23:28.790 --> 23:31.750
You have my sympathy because
you're a blind, trusting fool.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.960
Micky?
I told you
never to call me that.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.170
Yeah, I know.

23:38.170 --> 23:39.750
I was hoping it would disarm you
for what I'm about to say.

23:44.210 --> 23:47.250
What if Connor was
the anonymous source?

23:47.250 --> 23:48.830
What?
Think about it,
why it took him so long

23:48.830 --> 23:49.960
to show up at the hospital
that night.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.500
He was sexing Thomas.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.790
Or he was at the police station
signing his own immunity deal.

23:53.790 --> 23:56.580
No.
We're not doing this.

23:56.580 --> 23:59.250
Okay, well, why does he keep
pushing us to turn on Annalise?

23:59.250 --> 24:01.330
Okay, do you know why families
turn on each other?

24:01.330 --> 24:02.750
Because one family member
starts talking crap

24:02.750 --> 24:03.830
about another
family member.

24:03.830 --> 24:05.670
And then boom,
it's "The Borgias."

24:05.670 --> 24:07.830
I'm just saying,
we should ask him --
Mm!

24:07.830 --> 24:09.960
You will do nothing
of the sort.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.920
You will forget we ever had
this conversation

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
and promise to never
bring it up again.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.040
Yes?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.670
Michaela...

24:16.670 --> 24:18.040
Unh!

24:18.040 --> 24:21.000
The only appropriate
answer here is to nod.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.670
A dead baby is pretty much
the only guaranteed thing

24:29.670 --> 24:31.290
to make you feel bad
for someone.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.420
You're being so mean.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.830
Well, this is Annalise
we're talking about.

24:34.830 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, but people rarely
make up stories

24:37.000 --> 24:40.040
about their dead children,
so...maybe you could --

24:40.040 --> 24:42.000
I don't know --
believe the poor woman for once,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.420
especially with the way
her face is looking right now.

24:46.790 --> 24:48.580
How do you know
how her face looks?

24:51.380 --> 24:52.580
Was she here?

24:55.750 --> 24:56.750
Why?

24:57.750 --> 25:00.880
She needed me
to leak that article.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.500
Are you sure?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.250
Yes.
What's your problem?

25:07.710 --> 25:10.290
You don't...think
it's a little convenient

25:10.290 --> 25:12.290
that she came over
at the exact same time

25:12.290 --> 25:13.960
that you're hacking
her phone?

25:13.960 --> 25:16.330
No, I think you're
being paranoid.

25:16.330 --> 25:18.080
And you're being naive.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.080
Okay, I'm being naive.
And yet, here I am,

25:20.080 --> 25:22.460
going through her phone records
because you wanted me to.

25:24.670 --> 25:25.880
By the way,
you never told me

25:25.880 --> 25:27.670
that she called you over
to the house that night.

25:27.670 --> 25:30.250
Uh, yeah, I did.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.040
No, I knew she left a message
for Laurel and Wes,

25:32.040 --> 25:34.460
but not you.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.040
I got the voicemail
the next day.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.330
Why are you asking me
about this?

25:40.460 --> 25:41.880
No reason.

25:43.710 --> 25:49.540
♪ The gold is duller
to my eyes ♪

25:49.540 --> 25:52.500

You can
all stop stalking me.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.330
It's not like
I'm gonna go crazy or anything.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.750
No one would blame you
if you did.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.540
You've been through
a lot.

26:06.540 --> 26:07.880
I'm fine.

26:07.880 --> 26:11.290
Good.

26:11.290 --> 26:12.880
I'll tell Frank.

26:14.620 --> 26:15.670
He asked about you.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.880
Did you know her
when she was pregnant?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.710
I was a 1-L.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.500
Was she happy?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.830
Happier.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.460
Hello?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.040
You are
receiving a call from an inmate

27:18.040 --> 27:20.040
at Philadelphia County Prison.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.460
This call is being recorded.

27:21.460 --> 27:24.920
To accept the charges,
press 3.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.540
Bonnie?

27:34.540 --> 27:37.040
You there?

27:37.040 --> 27:39.290
We're being recorded.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.830
Look...Bonnie,

27:49.830 --> 27:54.040
I've been thinking
about things, and...

27:54.040 --> 27:57.250
I just want you
to know that...

27:57.250 --> 28:00.330
I'm doing everything I can
for our case.

28:00.330 --> 28:05.710
So if you need anything
from me...

28:05.710 --> 28:09.920
at all...
I'm here to help.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.960
Whatever you want.

28:42.580 --> 28:43.790
Yes?

28:43.790 --> 28:45.830
It's Ingrid Peters.

28:45.830 --> 28:48.290
I'm rejecting your request
for a grand-jury investigation.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.580
Excuse me?

28:49.580 --> 28:51.170
You leaked this article
to the press.

28:51.170 --> 28:53.790
I didn't have anything to do
with a leaked article.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.500
Let me be blunt.
If you continue to spread

28:55.500 --> 28:57.080
these ridiculous
conspiracy theories

28:57.080 --> 28:58.670
about the D.A.'s Office,

28:58.670 --> 29:00.750
I will order Mr. Denver
to go not only

29:00.750 --> 29:03.330
for life in prison on your case,
but the death penalty.

29:03.330 --> 29:06.170
That is what
I call a threat.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.710
So, I guess
you're my sponsor now.

29:41.710 --> 29:43.710
Oh. Don't say that.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.880
Makes it sound
too official.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.380
Thank you.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.960
Sorry I can't take your case
after all that.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.250
That's fine.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.000
No. It's not.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.670
'Cause your only
real chance of winning

29:59.670 --> 30:01.710
was if I was
representing you, so...

30:07.040 --> 30:10.040
You good?

30:10.040 --> 30:11.670
How's your case going?

30:14.920 --> 30:16.620
You don't have to talk
about it.

30:18.460 --> 30:19.500
It's a good sign

30:19.500 --> 30:21.670
that you're out on bail,
though, right?

30:21.670 --> 30:23.670
I thought you said

30:23.670 --> 30:25.040
we didn't have to talk
about this.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.750
I'm sorry. I...

30:30.750 --> 30:35.880
I just can't imagine
what you must be going through.

30:40.710 --> 30:43.120
Oh!

30:43.120 --> 30:48.500
Um...so there's
a huge controversy going on

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
about the naming rights

30:50.500 --> 30:53.500
for the new wing
of the law library.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.920
Why are you here?

30:55.920 --> 30:58.080
I just came to make sure
you were okay.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.960
We can't have
a glorified accident attorney

31:00.960 --> 31:03.210
as our namesake.

31:03.210 --> 31:04.710
Just call me
if you need anything.

31:04.710 --> 31:07.040
What did she offer you?

31:07.040 --> 31:09.170
Excuse me?

31:09.170 --> 31:12.000
Atwood.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.170
Did she promise
to get you custody of your kids?

31:17.620 --> 31:21.250
Don't make me feel like
a bigger fool than I already do.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.920
They're my children.

31:31.920 --> 31:35.710
You'd do the same thing
if you were in my shoes.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.620
We should just kill her.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.540
What?

31:59.540 --> 32:02.420
Atwood. She's a cancer.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.620
The important thing is,
you found out.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.460
What does that get me?

32:06.460 --> 32:09.250
Peace of mind while I go to jail
for the rest of my life?

32:18.250 --> 32:20.040
Tell them Nate was
at the house that night.

32:22.620 --> 32:24.500
I can just suggest
they look at his phone records.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.670
No.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.420
It gives them another suspect
who isn't you.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.620
Is this really
who you want to be?

32:29.620 --> 32:30.960
The people who burn down
everything around them,

32:30.960 --> 32:32.080
everyone around them?

32:34.250 --> 32:36.080
I don't.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.580
I'm going to bed.

32:45.710 --> 32:47.170
Bonnie?

32:49.080 --> 32:51.670
Frank have a lawyer yet?

33:06.040 --> 33:08.120
Where's Oliver?

33:08.120 --> 33:10.750
He's at home,
looking for a new job.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.540
Which is a better use of time
than us being here.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.330
The judge needs to see
that the people that loved Wes

33:16.330 --> 33:18.580
think Annalise is innocent.
Do we think she's innocent?

33:18.580 --> 33:19.580
Here he goes again.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.210
Stop.
Stop what?

33:21.210 --> 33:22.790
Why don't you say "Hi"
to your buddy Atwood over there?

33:22.790 --> 33:24.330
You could thank her
for the deal she got you.

33:24.330 --> 33:26.920
What deal?
He's drunk,
and judge is coming.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.000
So put your penises away.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.710
Mr. Delfino, since you've
called us all here today,

33:32.710 --> 33:33.960
why don't we let you begin.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.540
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.120
I'd like to file
a subpoena duces tecum

33:38.120 --> 33:40.380
for all of A.D.A. Atwood's
personal correspondence

33:40.380 --> 33:42.330
on the day
the victim's body was lost.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.830
Objection, Your Honor.

33:43.830 --> 33:46.380
Ms. Atwood's correspondence is
protected from disclosure

33:46.380 --> 33:47.920
by the
Work Product Doctrine.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.000
An exception has to be made
when there's a missing body, no?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.330
Our people are closing in
on where the body is.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.000
Yeah, but at that point, the
chain of custody will be broken,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.380
all because A.D.A. Atwood
lost the body on purpose.

33:57.380 --> 34:00.290
Mr. Delfino is
only arguing this motion

34:00.290 --> 34:01.880
at the direction
of Annalise Keating,

34:01.880 --> 34:03.920
who was warned
about such actions.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.420
Your Honor, my client has had no
communication with Mr. Delfino.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.210
Oh, please, Ms. Winterbottom
went to visit Mr. Delfino

34:09.210 --> 34:12.380
this morning.
Yes, to convince him
to re-hire his lawyer,

34:12.380 --> 34:14.210
so it wouldn't look like
we were colluding,

34:14.210 --> 34:16.250
which, ironically,
we're now being accused of.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.460
This was all my idea,
Judge.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.460
I'm a little offended
Mr. Denver's

34:18.460 --> 34:19.790
trying to give
someone else credit.

34:19.790 --> 34:22.420
All right, let me stop you
right there, Mr. Delfino.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.540
Without concrete evidence
of your theory,

34:24.540 --> 34:26.960
the law says Ms. Atwood's
private communications

34:26.960 --> 34:28.380
cannot be subpoenaed.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.540
I have evidence. He just didn't
let me get to that part.

34:30.540 --> 34:31.750
Get it, Frank.

34:31.750 --> 34:34.380
This is the victim's
Morgue Transfer sheet,

34:34.380 --> 34:36.500
signed by an investigator
hired by Ms. Atwood's office,

34:36.500 --> 34:37.920
Nate Lahey.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.710
This is proof Mr. Lahey moved

34:39.710 --> 34:41.500
and hid the body
from Ms. Atwood.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.170
Mr. Lahey does not work
on this case, Judge.

34:44.170 --> 34:45.500
He's Ms. Atwood's boyfriend.
Doesn't that matter?

34:46.790 --> 34:49.210
Is this true, Ms. Atwood?

34:49.210 --> 34:51.380
You have a romantic relationship
with Mr. Lahey?

34:51.380 --> 34:54.920
We were at some point,
but it ended before this case.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.170
Were you aware of such
a relationship, Mr. Denver?

34:57.170 --> 34:59.210
The D.A.'s Office imposes
no restrictions on its staff

34:59.210 --> 35:02.040
regarding
workplace relationships.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.920
Mr. Delfino,
though ill-advised,

35:04.920 --> 35:07.670
A.D.A. Atwood and Mr. Lahey
broke no laws.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.880
What about
the Sixth Amendment?

35:08.880 --> 35:10.620
That's the one that says

35:10.620 --> 35:13.000
every defendant has the right
to a fair trial, correct?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.830
Well,
what's happening here?

35:14.830 --> 35:18.250
The prosecution's tampering
with evidence, showing bias,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.620
not to mention they got tons
of conflict of interest.

35:20.620 --> 35:21.750
That's the opposite
of fair.

35:21.750 --> 35:24.000
It's just a damn subpoena,
Your Honor.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.210
Watch your language,
Mr. Delfino.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.830
Sorry.

35:26.830 --> 35:30.250
But you did hit
on a valid point.

35:30.250 --> 35:33.460
Mr. Delfino is correct in that
even just the appearance of bias

35:33.460 --> 35:35.830
can waive the D.A.'s protection
from disclosure.

35:35.830 --> 35:38.040
Only in extreme cases,
Judge.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.460
I find this to be one of those.
I'm granting the subpoena.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.500
Ms. Atwood,
you are hereby ordered

35:44.500 --> 35:47.290
to turn over your e-mails,
calls, and text messages

35:47.290 --> 35:49.830
for the day
the body was transferred.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.380
You have jeopardized

36:03.380 --> 36:04.830
this case
and the integrity of my office.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.460
Every shred of evidence that you
have been in contact with,

36:06.460 --> 36:08.460
now comes into question.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.080
And all because you needed
to get laid!

36:11.080 --> 36:13.080
I can fix this.
If you just give me a chance --

36:13.080 --> 36:15.250
Are you kidding?
You are suspended!

36:15.250 --> 36:18.040
You will give me
those records

36:18.040 --> 36:20.710
so I can prepare for what is
coming down the line.

36:20.710 --> 36:24.080
I can tell you
what's coming.

36:36.380 --> 36:37.960
This was the only way
we could get at Atwood.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.960
And it's gonna hit her harder
than it hits you.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.330
Annalise.
It's hard to trust me.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.540
God knows --
It worked.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.960
Atwood admitted
she moved Wes' body.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.250
I'm in the clear.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.580
Did they find the body?

37:07.710 --> 37:08.920
Hi.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.580
Wow.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.210
You came
all the way over here,

37:29.210 --> 37:30.420
and you still don't know
what to say to me?

37:30.420 --> 37:33.000
How about this.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.540
"I'm sorry, Laurel."
You could start there.

37:36.540 --> 37:39.080
Laurel....

37:39.080 --> 37:40.790
What?

37:45.710 --> 37:47.540
Wes was cremated.

37:51.210 --> 37:53.210
Isn't this good?

37:53.210 --> 37:55.620
I mean, not that it's good.
It's sad.

37:55.620 --> 37:57.000
But if he's cremated,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.830
then we can get
AK's charges dropped.

37:58.830 --> 38:01.040
I mean, any jury's
gonna find that sketchy.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.460
Our it just means Annalise
can't prove she didn't do this.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.120
Is that true?

38:05.120 --> 38:07.880
I don't know.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.120
Where is Annalise?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.960
None of your business.
Now that's sketchy.

38:11.830 --> 38:14.080
Do you have a problem?

38:14.080 --> 38:16.460
Because I understand
why Laurel might be acting

38:16.460 --> 38:17.880
like a little bitch right now,
but not you.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.750
You have no idea.
Asher...

38:19.750 --> 38:21.080
No, BonBon
needs to hear this.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.670
'Cause you know why I think
family's get torn apart?

38:22.670 --> 38:24.830
Because secrets.
Ignore him. He's tired.

38:24.830 --> 38:27.460
No, what is this secret,
Asher?

38:27.460 --> 38:30.120
No, I'm leaving if this is about
to turn into another brawl.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.420
I think Connor's
the anonymous source.

38:32.420 --> 38:35.000
So, Atwood's working
with the Mahoneys,

38:35.000 --> 38:36.380
like I said.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.920
It's possible.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.210
It's true.

38:39.210 --> 38:42.500
We shouldn't jump
to any conclusions right now.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.460
What happened to you
in there?

38:44.460 --> 38:47.250
It's jail. I get it.
It's horrible.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.880
But it's your life
we're talking about.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.250
If you don't care about Wes,
I get that.

38:50.250 --> 38:51.420
But care about yourself.

38:51.420 --> 38:52.460
I care about Wes.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.500
You don't need to say that

38:53.500 --> 38:54.670
just 'cause you think
it sounds good.

38:54.670 --> 38:56.620
I'm still in shock
that he's gone.

38:56.620 --> 39:00.120
He's not your son.
I get it.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.960
You don't need to cry about him
in front of me.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.960
But I do need you
to take action.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.250
Yeah, I do need you
to be the person

39:06.250 --> 39:07.830
that you promised us
you were.

39:07.830 --> 39:09.250
You know,
that's why we've been

39:09.250 --> 39:11.710
following you this whole time
and trusting you.

39:11.710 --> 39:14.080
Because you said that
you knew what you were doing!

39:14.080 --> 39:15.670
But now one of us
just got killed,

39:15.670 --> 39:17.880
and we need to find out
who did that!

39:19.920 --> 39:21.290
Where's your proof?

39:21.290 --> 39:22.830
Your behavior's my proof.

39:22.830 --> 39:23.920
What the hell
does that even mean?

39:23.920 --> 39:25.330
You keep saying
that Annalise did this,

39:25.330 --> 39:26.500
even though all the evidence

39:26.500 --> 39:27.710
points to the fact
that it was the Mahoneys.

39:27.710 --> 39:28.880
You keep saying
Annalise did this?

39:28.880 --> 39:30.080
He's exaggerating.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.210
No, he's not.

39:31.210 --> 39:32.830
You would defend
your stupid boyfriend.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.210
Even since Wes died,
all you've done is

39:34.210 --> 39:37.040
point the finger at Annalise,
which is suspicious behavior.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.250
The first thing guilty people do
is try to blame someone else.

39:39.250 --> 39:41.250
Like a fart.
If you smelt it, you dealt it.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.620
Fine, I think there's
quite a good chance

39:43.620 --> 39:45.250
that Annalise did this.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.830
Why?
Her phone.

39:46.830 --> 39:48.460
That she had Oliver clear.

39:48.460 --> 39:49.670
Because
it holds information

39:49.670 --> 39:51.670
about a lot of bad things
we all do.

39:51.670 --> 39:52.830
That doesn't mean
that one of them

39:52.830 --> 39:54.420
was killing Wes.
Are you sure?

39:54.420 --> 39:57.460
Yes!

39:57.460 --> 39:58.580
'Cause I'm about
to have proof.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.750
Oliver kept
a copy of Annalise's phone

40:02.750 --> 40:03.830
and has been
going through it.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.460
Are you kidding?
What?!

40:05.460 --> 40:06.670
Are you sure you want to keep
denying Annalise's involvement?

40:08.620 --> 40:10.000
You think
I don't care about him?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.750
You really think that?

40:11.750 --> 40:15.080
I don't know.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.880
He wasn't my son.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.250
Maybe it would be easier
if he was.

40:21.250 --> 40:25.250
Then I would know...
how I feel...

40:27.670 --> 40:30.290
...what I feel right now.

40:33.420 --> 40:36.580
All I know is
that it's horrific...

40:38.750 --> 40:39.790
...and I'm sorry.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.750
I'm really sorry.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.710
I'm just --
I'm so angry.

41:03.710 --> 41:05.120
I know.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.040
He deserved
so much better than this.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.460
He did.

41:12.380 --> 41:14.540
I promise you that we're gonna
find who did this to him.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.620
We owe him that.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.250
Hey.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.790
Hey, so, uh...
I did something kind of stupid.

41:30.620 --> 41:33.210
Oli?

41:33.210 --> 41:34.580
All this time,
you've been telling me

41:34.580 --> 41:36.000
Annalise was
hiding something

41:36.000 --> 41:37.250
when you're the one
with the secret.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.880
What are
you talking about?

41:41.880 --> 41:44.040
You checked your voicemail
that night.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.250
I kept wondering why it took you
so long to get to the hospital.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.210
I just figured you were
with Thomas the whole time,

41:49.210 --> 41:50.420
boning for six hours.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.080
So I called him.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.880
He said that you left his
apartment hours before the fire,

41:56.880 --> 42:00.540
and that you used his cellphone
to check your voicemail.

42:00.540 --> 42:04.040
You went to Annalise's house
that night, didn't you?

42:13.880 --> 42:16.750
1, 2, 3, 4.
