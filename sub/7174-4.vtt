WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.372
Previously on The Expanse...

00:05.405 --> 00:06.374
He's hypoxic.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.242
His breather's crapping out!

00:08.342 --> 00:10.076
You can breathe off mine, okay?

00:10.176 --> 00:11.244
Breathe it in.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.948
My name is James Holden,

00:14.047 --> 00:16.349
speaking for the five
survivors of the  Canterbury.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.253
Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus
SOS from a ship called the  Scopuli.

00:20.753 --> 00:23.256
We are about to be taken
aboard the MCRN Donnager.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.493
- Alex, shut him down!
- We have the right to legal...

00:27.526 --> 00:31.031
Good golly, Ms. Mao. You sure can pick 'em.

00:33.332 --> 00:35.302
Curfew is now in effect on Medina Level.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.771
Do you think I'm OPA?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.940
These are the hallmark
skill sets of terrorists.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.242
Mars didn't destroy the Canterbury.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.410
Then who did?

00:43.510 --> 00:45.145
I flew with the Mars Navy for 20 years

00:45.245 --> 00:46.579
before I shipped off on the Cant.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.982
- Are you OPA?
- We putting all our cards on the table here?

00:49.082 --> 00:51.686
- Sleeper agents. You ever heard of them?
- Well, screw you...

00:51.786 --> 00:53.988
- Guys!
- Human shields, you ever heard of those?

00:54.088 --> 00:56.457
Hey! I'm ready to talk,
but only to your captain.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.857
Come on, guys, it's over.
Just... just go home.

01:00.159 --> 01:01.895
No, no, no!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.023 --> 01:33.393
Sorry to keep you waiting,
we've been busier than usual.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.198
Still getting intakes from all
over the Medina, even from Uptown.

01:40.833 --> 01:43.570
You know what the average
life expectancy on Earth is?

01:43.671 --> 01:44.637
No.

01:44.737 --> 01:47.007
123 years. It's even better on Mars.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.877
You know what it is on Ceres? 68.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.847
And with the recent unpleasantness,
that average is only going down.

01:55.714 --> 01:56.750
What?

01:56.850 --> 01:59.519
Nothing. I'm sure you're
younger than you look.

02:06.992 --> 02:09.128
Stiff's ID is Bizi Betiko.

02:09.527 --> 02:11.532
You know, there is no
religious directive on file,

02:11.631 --> 02:13.234
so okay if I recycle him?

02:13.333 --> 02:15.035
Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.

02:15.601 --> 02:16.871
Not yet.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.219
I'd like to know what the hell Holden
is discussing with the Captain right now.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.887
For all we know, he could
be working out a deal.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.956
Yeah, for himself.

02:39.291 --> 02:43.396
The only thing I see
here is an incoming ship.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.732
One you can't even identify.

02:46.398 --> 02:48.836
How do you know they're coming for Naomi?

02:49.135 --> 02:51.137
We don't. It's a guess.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.341
And you're just guessing Naomi's OPA, too.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.077
We both know that's better than a guess.

02:57.544 --> 03:00.781
She is the best liar
amongst all of you, by far.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.350
And she is hiding something.
You can sense that, too.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.886
I don't believe she's a terrorist.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.557
And even if she was, I'm not
blaming her for the Canterbury.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.193
You blamed it on us.

03:13.826 --> 03:14.761
We found Martian naval tech in the
beacon that lured us to the Scopuli,

03:14.861 --> 03:16.029
and then you showed up.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.765
We had nothing to do with the Canterbury,

03:18.866 --> 03:21.601
but because of you, Earth
thinks we destroyed it.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.972
Some people are calling it an act of war.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.974
You need to recant.

03:27.074 --> 03:31.545
Blame Nagata. True or not, it will change
the narrative until cooler heads prevail

03:31.645 --> 03:33.948
and figure out what really happened.

03:35.147 --> 03:36.716
I won't do it.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.986
There's some kind of
game being played here.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.720
Maybe someone wants a war, I don't know,

03:40.820 --> 03:44.491
but if you really do want to stop
it, then let us go and then we talk.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.994
Captain, inbound vessel approaching
defense perimeter. One minute to contact.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.896
Hail them. Frequencies open.

03:49.997 --> 03:54.502
Unidentified vessel, this is Captain
Theresa Yao, of the MCRN Donnager.

03:55.168 --> 03:59.573
This is your final warning. If you maintain
your present course you will be fired upon.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.374
They're jamming us.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.158
Multiple fast movers detected!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.926
More than one ship. I count six bandits.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.731
Missile launch alert.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.866
Sound general quarters.
All hands, battle stations.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.500
Prepare to return fire.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.575
- What's happening?
- That's battle mode lighting.

04:34.076 --> 04:35.176
Must be a drill.

04:37.142 --> 04:38.546
Okay, what's that?

04:39.578 --> 04:41.481
It sounds like torpedoes being fired.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.052
Sounds like a lot of torpedoes.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.387
I don't think it's a drill.

04:48.053 --> 04:49.989
Maybe we should get strapped in.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.058
Good idea.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.279
Torpedoes are away!
Guidance lock on all targets.

05:19.551 --> 05:22.355
Well, whoever they are, and
whatever they've come to do,

05:22.822 --> 05:25.259
it's just become a suicide mission.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.129
They started this fight,
and we're going to finish it.

05:42.741 --> 05:44.677
We can't tell who they're fighting.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.080
There's massive LADAR and RADAR jamming,

05:47.181 --> 05:49.782
we can't resolve the drive
signatures or make any visual IDs.

05:49.948 --> 05:53.751
They took our people hostage.
We have to get a ship there.

05:53.852 --> 05:55.753
The  Orinoco's en route
at best possible speed,

05:55.854 --> 05:57.089
but they're still two days out.

05:57.188 --> 06:01.659
It'll all be over by then. Somebody
has a new fleet of warships.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.197
I concur. Any idea who it might be?

06:05.296 --> 06:07.866
Not yet. Keep me apprised.

06:09.032 --> 06:12.503
While I was so young, I
was wiser than they thought.

06:12.604 --> 06:15.440
"Dear, dear," says I,
"punishment is death."

06:15.541 --> 06:18.410
"Aye," says he, "if they
can get hands on me."

06:24.015 --> 06:25.717
Incoming targets at 15...

06:25.818 --> 06:27.519
Let's get an additional readout on this...

06:30.789 --> 06:32.291
You look nervous.

06:32.623 --> 06:34.392
I get that way when
missiles are flying at me.

06:36.527 --> 06:39.498
Don't worry. It's nothing
our guns can't handle.

06:39.763 --> 06:42.234
I take it you didn't see
much action in the UN Navy?

06:42.334 --> 06:44.837
- That was a good thing.
- Not for soldiers.

06:46.503 --> 06:50.109
The only combat most of my
officers have seen is in simulators.

06:50.642 --> 06:54.213
Fortunately, I got to spend three
years cleansing the Belt of pirates

06:54.313 --> 06:57.282
who were poaching terraforming
supplies intended for Mars.

06:59.416 --> 07:01.587
I'm sure they weren't all bad people.

07:02.253 --> 07:05.056
But sometimes you have to kill to preserve.

07:05.157 --> 07:07.058
Captain Yao, you're
needed on Comms deck two.

07:07.159 --> 07:09.928
- PDCs ready?
- All arrays are online and standing by.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.277
Appa says you shouldn't be on the roof.

07:26.945 --> 07:28.480
And you should?

07:40.157 --> 07:41.993
They're nothing to be scared of, you know.

07:42.094 --> 07:44.897
They're just little rocks
that burn up in the sky.

07:44.996 --> 07:47.064
They're not always so little.

07:48.433 --> 07:51.537
You mean like the one
that killed the dinosaurs?

07:51.936 --> 07:53.104
Uh-huh.

07:53.938 --> 07:55.908
Okay, that rock was big.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.309
But that hardly ever happens.

07:58.409 --> 07:59.645
Like winning the lottery.

08:02.947 --> 08:05.551
I worry about people who throw rocks.

08:06.618 --> 08:09.254
Nobody could throw rocks that big.

08:09.354 --> 08:12.925
It just happens, sometimes,
because, you know, gravity.

08:13.457 --> 08:14.460
Hmm.

08:15.426 --> 08:17.062
Come in and play.

08:19.796 --> 08:21.767
I'll come and put you to bed.

08:21.866 --> 08:23.501
You're no fun.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.145
May I ask you a question?

08:36.480 --> 08:37.515
Do you miss Earth?

08:38.649 --> 08:39.917
If I did, I'd go back.

08:42.019 --> 08:44.522
My great-uncle emigrated from Earth.

08:45.223 --> 08:46.657
He missed it terribly.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.361
He used to tell me stories
when I was a little boy

08:49.460 --> 08:52.431
about these endless blue skies,

08:53.297 --> 08:55.032
free air everywhere.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.237
Open water all the way to the horizon.

08:58.835 --> 09:01.706
He told me that someday we
would make Mars just like that.

09:02.739 --> 09:06.010
When you spend your whole
life living under a dome,

09:06.677 --> 09:10.147
even the idea of an ocean
seems impossible to imagine.

09:13.817 --> 09:16.320
I could never understand your people.

09:16.421 --> 09:19.157
Why, when the universe had
bestowed so much upon you,

09:19.257 --> 09:21.026
you seemed to care so little for it.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.160
Wrecking things is what Earthers do best.

09:25.495 --> 09:28.232
Martians, too, by the look of your ship.

09:28.498 --> 09:30.134
We are nothing like you.

09:31.134 --> 09:33.771
The only things Earthers care
about is government handouts.

09:33.872 --> 09:38.844
Free food, free water, free drugs so that
you can forget the aimless lives you lead.

09:39.877 --> 09:42.347
You're short-sighted and selfish,

09:42.446 --> 09:44.282
and it will destroy you.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.252
Incoming torpedoes in
PDC range, one minute.

09:49.519 --> 09:51.756
Earth is over, Mr. Holden.

09:53.190 --> 09:56.929
My only hope is that we can bring Mars
to life before you destroy that, too.

09:58.662 --> 09:59.965
Secure the prisoner.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.198
Yes, sir.

10:03.434 --> 10:04.603
Get in the chair.

10:08.873 --> 10:09.907
Come on.

10:11.475 --> 10:12.977
I hope you enjoy the show.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.582
Lock PDCs and engage.

10:18.115 --> 10:19.116
PDCs are go.

10:30.762 --> 10:32.864
Splash one! Five more to go.

10:36.968 --> 10:38.402
Is there a problem?

10:38.503 --> 10:41.373
No, sir, it's just their torps'
guidance systems are really good.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.590
Better than anything
we ever simmed against.

10:43.591 --> 10:45.112
They're pushing our PDCs to the limit.

10:50.547 --> 10:52.583
Impact on main reactor housing.

10:52.684 --> 10:54.886
Captain, enemy ships are now
inside guided missile range.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.520
Torpedoes will no longer be effective.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.390
Enough of this. Bring up the rail
guns. Let's finish this and go home.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.626
Aye, sir. Diverting power to rail guns.

11:33.891 --> 11:36.061
I'm looking for Bizi Betiko.

11:36.161 --> 11:38.497
You're not going to find him here.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.233
Why you pensa?

11:41.666 --> 11:43.267
Why you pensa?

11:44.267 --> 11:47.138
- Why you pensa?
- Why you pensa?

11:47.239 --> 11:51.243
- This is his place, right?
- So, ya, that it is.

12:22.373 --> 12:24.710
Which puts me at 29 days,

12:25.276 --> 12:28.180
seven hours and 13 minutes

12:28.280 --> 12:31.083
of  pura, unpowered flight.

12:34.017 --> 12:36.287
I carve it up around the
big-gas, then load up more spin...

12:36.388 --> 12:37.689
- Romanov.
- ... going 'round the Ringer.

12:39.623 --> 12:42.594
It's only three million
clicks of hard vacuum

12:44.195 --> 12:46.931
to hit a bull's-eye smaller
than a mosquito's ass

12:48.666 --> 12:51.802
and fly my way into the record books.

12:52.969 --> 12:54.138
Slingshot club.

12:54.238 --> 12:57.476
Yeah. Oh, for entertainment
purposes only, sasa ke.

12:57.742 --> 12:59.211
No license required.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.747
Ah, I don't give a crap about that. Huh?

13:01.846 --> 13:04.548
Wanna bet, ke? Action good tonight.

13:05.749 --> 13:08.586
All right, listen up! Star Helix.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.323
I'm looking for a girl.

13:12.089 --> 13:15.460
- Her name's Julie, she was a pilot.
- Oh.

13:15.892 --> 13:18.997
- She might've come to Bizi to charter a ship?
- Oh.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.234
Here.

13:24.301 --> 13:27.339
Hey, assholes. Bizi Betiko is dead.

13:30.474 --> 13:33.979
He ain't dead yet, copeng. He be out there.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.215
That Bizi Betiko!

13:38.215 --> 13:39.683
Watch the way it's done...

13:58.735 --> 14:00.571
Sabaka!

14:03.407 --> 14:06.912
Bizi, Bizi, Bizi, Bizi!

14:08.012 --> 14:09.214
Come on, come on, come on.

14:11.147 --> 14:13.317
Come on, come on, come on.

14:13.684 --> 14:17.088
Come on, come on, come on.

14:23.194 --> 14:24.362
Now he dead.

14:24.461 --> 14:28.666
Should've bet. Should've bet.

14:37.557 --> 14:40.527
The  Nauvoo's engines have
all been tested and certified,

14:40.626 --> 14:44.263
and we've been able to continue
laying down the hull at the same time.

14:44.363 --> 14:47.266
Which means, everything
is proceeding on schedule

14:47.366 --> 14:50.337
and on budget, which I'm
sure you're pleased to hear.

14:50.437 --> 14:51.603
Mr. Johnson.

14:52.106 --> 14:56.242
The Latter Day Saints took a considerable
risk hiring you to build the Nauvoo.

14:56.976 --> 14:58.278
I know.

14:58.544 --> 15:00.514
Tycho spins up asteroids.

15:00.613 --> 15:03.049
We don't build ships, not till now.

15:03.415 --> 15:06.953
But trust me, it'll be a
ship no one will ever forget.

15:07.053 --> 15:08.422
That's not what I meant.

15:09.121 --> 15:12.726
I meant you. There have been rumblings

15:13.159 --> 15:16.129
that you should be replaced as
Head of Operations for the project.

15:24.504 --> 15:25.772
Why is that?

15:26.805 --> 15:28.574
Your ties to the OPA have been making

15:28.674 --> 15:31.678
a number of Elders in the
general authorities uncomfortable,

15:31.778 --> 15:33.880
particularly in light of the
recent events in the Belt.

15:33.980 --> 15:37.651
The OPA is only interested in human rights

15:37.751 --> 15:39.852
and jobs for all Belters.

15:39.953 --> 15:42.088
And fomenting riots on Ceres.

15:42.188 --> 15:44.491
And inflaming passions in
the wake of the Canterbury.

15:44.591 --> 15:48.061
The history of organized religion
isn't exactly strife-free.

15:50.762 --> 15:53.332
I've been asked to request
a new Head of Operations.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.270
Of course. If that's what you want.

15:58.103 --> 16:01.407
But I'd be remiss if I didn't
remind you that, without me,

16:01.507 --> 16:03.442
you're going to have a very
difficult time retaining

16:03.543 --> 16:06.279
the most skilled Belters for your project.

16:07.012 --> 16:09.815
I mean the ones who build for reliability.

16:10.315 --> 16:13.486
You're about to send your
best and brightest Mormons

16:13.587 --> 16:17.624
on a hundred-year voyage to
a new world around a new sun.

16:18.256 --> 16:21.995
Who knows what tragic malfunctions
might occur along the way?

16:26.164 --> 16:27.933
So who'd you have in mind?

16:33.072 --> 16:35.408
We're still weighing our options.

16:36.342 --> 16:40.013
For now, uh, please just
continue along, as before.

16:41.146 --> 16:42.348
Great.

16:45.418 --> 16:49.356
We have some calibration work to
do on the Nauvoo's  sensor arrays.

16:49.456 --> 16:51.758
So I'm going to need you to
get all your people off the ship

16:52.190 --> 16:54.326
and I'll let you know when we're done.

17:25.958 --> 17:27.594
We're good to go.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.564
Get all the Mormons off the ship

17:30.664 --> 17:33.866
and get those sensors
pointed toward the Donnager.

17:33.966 --> 17:36.035
I need a full report, now.

17:51.484 --> 17:53.887
They've got rail guns, too. I've
never seen them on ships this size.

17:55.722 --> 17:58.791
Shit. I think they're diverting
power to the rail guns.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.861
That means we're in CQB.

18:01.962 --> 18:03.964
- What the hell is CQB?
- A close quarter battle.

18:04.063 --> 18:07.367
Who would be insane enough to
take on the Donnager in CQB?

18:09.335 --> 18:11.238
God damn it, let me out of this chair!

18:11.338 --> 18:13.674
I don't need to be here.
Put me back with my people.

18:13.773 --> 18:17.577
Keep him quiet or gag him. I want IDs.
We need to know their capabilities.

18:17.676 --> 18:19.812
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
nothing matching their profile

18:19.913 --> 18:21.248
in MCRN or UN records.

18:21.348 --> 18:22.749
Isolate each vessel.

18:22.849 --> 18:25.185
I want detailed imagery and drive
signatures on every one of them.

18:25.417 --> 18:26.820
Captain to DC-4.

18:32.759 --> 18:34.661
I've seen a ship like that before.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.565
Splash three and four!

18:42.033 --> 18:43.602
Lieutenant, the main drive is overloading.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.038
We have to shut it down.

18:51.409 --> 18:52.545
Uh, guys...

18:52.646 --> 18:54.447
The drive's out. Good.

18:54.981 --> 18:56.883
No, this ain't good at all.

18:56.983 --> 18:58.585
You know, for a badass Mickie Navy boy,

18:58.685 --> 18:59.752
you're a pretty whiny little bitch.

18:59.851 --> 19:02.621
I was just a transport pilot,
you yahoo! You understand?

19:02.722 --> 19:04.324
I wasn't trained for this shit!

19:04.424 --> 19:07.493
I was a glorified bus
driver, okay? You satisfied?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.031
Oh, man, this is not
supposed to be happening.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.499
- Shh, hey, Alex.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:13.599 --> 19:16.136
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look what I got.

19:17.369 --> 19:18.504
Huh?

19:18.971 --> 19:21.308
Everything's going to be okay, okay?

19:21.407 --> 19:23.243
This is going to calm you right down.

19:24.644 --> 19:26.413
Trust me, we're all going to be just...

19:56.643 --> 19:58.345
We need to plug the holes!

21:36.841 --> 21:38.711
Rail gun one is down,
master caution is lit.

21:43.081 --> 21:45.051
Man down! Medics to CIC.

21:52.657 --> 21:54.628
You said you've seen this ship before.

21:54.727 --> 21:56.362
One just like it blew up the Canterbury.

21:58.997 --> 22:01.133
Can we get security to the hull, please.

22:01.233 --> 22:04.236
- They stopped firing. Why?
- Confirm massive hull damage.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.586
Breaching pods on deck.
We're being boarded.

22:19.685 --> 22:21.687
- Captain, this man has something to tell you.
- Not now, Lieutenant.

22:21.788 --> 22:24.524
The ships you're fighting are just like
the ones that blew up the Canterbury.

22:25.992 --> 22:29.029
Whoever's responsible for this is
trying to frame Mars for everything.

22:33.331 --> 22:36.835
Lopez, I want you to get
Mr. Holden off of this ship

22:36.935 --> 22:39.205
and safely back to MCRN Command.

22:39.304 --> 22:41.608
He's the only person who
can directly testify to this.

22:41.807 --> 22:43.410
Understood, sir. Take him.

22:43.510 --> 22:46.780
Hold on. I'm not going
anywhere without my shipmates.

22:46.879 --> 22:48.380
Get him in his suit!

22:56.621 --> 22:58.657
Make sure you get this off with him.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.570
The air rushed out of holes
on both sides of the room,

23:10.669 --> 23:12.538
which means we're
surrounded by a hard vacuum.

23:12.638 --> 23:13.872
We're trapped.

23:13.973 --> 23:16.576
Maybe... maybe we can force the door.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.644
Mars builds too well,
you know that. Damn it!

23:18.744 --> 23:21.613
We'd still be screwed because
we don't have our pressure suits.

23:23.214 --> 23:25.452
Atmosphere systems are still out.

23:25.684 --> 23:27.820
I figure we have maybe
20 minutes of air left.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.188
Crap!

23:31.956 --> 23:33.092
What're you doing?

23:34.126 --> 23:35.261
Sedative.

23:36.794 --> 23:38.531
There's enough here to take one of us
out, which will slow down their breathing

23:38.630 --> 23:40.599
and cut down our oxygen use.

23:40.699 --> 23:43.102
- Maybe buy us a little more extra time.
- For what?

23:43.203 --> 23:44.671
You think someone's
going to come and get us?

23:44.771 --> 23:47.807
We don't have comms, we can't call
for help. Do you got a better plan?

23:48.040 --> 23:49.541
It's my idea. I'll take the shot.

23:49.641 --> 23:51.276
No! We need you conscious.

23:51.743 --> 23:54.380
He's an Earther, he uses the
most air. He should do it!

23:54.481 --> 23:56.616
I can carry you. You can't carry me.

23:59.018 --> 24:00.520
Damn it.

24:10.463 --> 24:12.264
I wanna wake up.

25:05.384 --> 25:07.253
I want to say thank you.

25:09.088 --> 25:10.322
You know,

25:12.023 --> 25:14.660
for helping me all those times you did.

25:18.531 --> 25:20.332
You're a good person.

25:23.101 --> 25:24.970
I could've been better.

25:29.541 --> 25:31.945
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

25:34.547 --> 25:35.714
To who?

25:38.216 --> 25:40.052
It doesn't matter.

26:07.745 --> 26:09.381
You know what really chaps my ass?

26:09.482 --> 26:11.618
The fact that I'm here
protecting some lousy Earth taker

26:11.717 --> 26:12.918
while my ship's getting pounded

26:13.019 --> 26:14.068
and my buddies are dying.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.550
Then why don't you go help
them and let me go help mine.

26:16.556 --> 26:19.480
We have our orders. Duty
means something on Mars.

26:19.594 --> 26:21.125
I'd be happy to let you go.

26:21.126 --> 26:23.553
I heard you and your friends
were responsible for Phoebe.

26:23.562 --> 26:25.750
I know nothing about Phoebe.
Why don't you just ask him?

26:32.070 --> 26:33.272
Fall back and cover!

26:33.406 --> 26:35.907
Holden! Get back and
stay back! And stay down!

26:58.631 --> 27:01.734
Holden, stop! God damn
it, Holden! Get back here!

27:15.855 --> 27:18.555
Okay, I'm here. What's so important
that I had to drop everything

27:18.556 --> 27:19.759
and come to this hell hole?

27:19.893 --> 27:22.615
- Recognize this guy?
- Yeah. The stiff you found in the Square.

27:22.659 --> 27:24.861
- I heard it was a murder.
- Look at this.

27:26.828 --> 27:29.499
Great, you found his ID. That's
how it's supposed to work.

27:29.598 --> 27:31.166
It's not him, see.

27:31.267 --> 27:33.903
Every time I sample the guy,
I get a different ID comes up

27:34.003 --> 27:35.671
with a face that looks
like it could be a match.

27:35.771 --> 27:36.740
Huh.

27:37.472 --> 27:39.241
Your stiff's got a lot of implants.

27:39.342 --> 27:41.645
I bet he has an ID spoofer mod.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.914
They're designed to spin cops, waste
their time chasing down false leads.

27:45.015 --> 27:46.716
The only guys who really
use them are crooks.

27:46.816 --> 27:48.351
Successful ones. They're not cheap.

27:48.451 --> 27:51.488
You are way more of a
gear-head than I ever was.

27:51.854 --> 27:54.591
- Can you help me ID him?
- Miller, you have a partner for this kind of stuff.

27:54.691 --> 27:56.860
No, I tried Havelock, he
didn't want to be found.

27:58.693 --> 28:00.462
I've done the same from time to time.

28:03.365 --> 28:04.366
Please?

28:06.167 --> 28:07.303
Well,

28:08.837 --> 28:11.307
if he has a spoofer, then he's probably
got a bunch of other shady shit in him.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.109
Standard inner-ear mike,

28:13.976 --> 28:15.178
spinal stabilizer,

28:15.845 --> 28:19.082
pancreatic pump, run of
the mill, for the sedentary.

28:21.384 --> 28:22.419
Ha!

28:22.519 --> 28:24.320
He's got a memory crypt in his calf.

28:26.521 --> 28:27.923
Let's take it out.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.925
- I'll get the Coroner.
- No.

28:31.192 --> 28:32.796
That guy talks too much.

28:40.102 --> 28:41.104
Here we go.

29:05.760 --> 29:06.962
Damn it.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.165
Well, it's not like I'm hurting the guy.

29:17.306 --> 29:18.307
There.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.442
Bingo.

29:33.955 --> 29:35.858
Content's encrypted, obviously.

29:36.157 --> 29:38.360
But judging by the file names,
these are government records.

29:38.461 --> 29:39.596
Okay.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.365
Customs documents, corporate R&D...

29:42.932 --> 29:44.401
This guy was a data broker.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.701
Oh.

29:45.934 --> 29:48.038
Well, whatever he brokered,

29:49.270 --> 29:51.407
must have been important
enough to get him killed.

29:51.508 --> 29:54.110
- What're you not telling me?
- Nothing.

29:54.710 --> 29:55.944
Miller.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.915
It's better if you don't know.

30:00.782 --> 30:02.151
I don't need you to protect me.

30:02.251 --> 30:04.119
I'm not protecting you.

30:04.586 --> 30:06.122
I...

30:06.221 --> 30:08.223
I hate it when you do this.

30:13.628 --> 30:14.630
Thanks.

30:16.198 --> 30:17.467
Havelock.

30:17.665 --> 30:19.535
Come on.

30:21.503 --> 30:23.338
All right. Leave him a message.

30:25.374 --> 30:27.443
Hey, look, um...

30:27.710 --> 30:30.145
I don't care if you're up
to your whatever in whoever,

30:30.445 --> 30:32.182
but when you come up for air,

30:32.281 --> 30:35.018
I'm gonna need you to cover
for me with Shaddid, okay?

30:35.117 --> 30:39.455
I can't give you any details, but
just use your imagination, all right?

30:39.855 --> 30:42.325
I know you can be a devious son
of a bitch when you want to be.

30:43.025 --> 30:44.561
I'd do the same for you.

30:54.470 --> 30:58.107
Oh shit! Shit! I'll get help!

30:58.773 --> 31:01.577
Somebody help! This officer needs help!

31:02.443 --> 31:04.580
Help me!

32:12.749 --> 32:15.518
Let go. Don't make me shoot you.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.252
You won't.

32:28.797 --> 32:32.268
His weapon is keyed to his
armor, he couldn't have fired it.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.336
You're welcome.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.605
Mole's dead, asshole.

32:38.574 --> 32:43.145
I'm sorry, I really am. But
I won't testify to anything

32:43.945 --> 32:45.981
unless you help me get
my friends off this ship.

32:46.082 --> 32:48.785
- Shut up. I want to speak to him.
- Yes, sir.

32:50.118 --> 32:54.723
He doesn't look like any OPA grunt I've
ever seen. Tech is way too advanced.

32:54.957 --> 32:56.392
Yours.

33:00.628 --> 33:04.800
Who are you working for? Why
did you destroy the  Canterbury?

33:05.567 --> 33:06.803
Phoebe Station. Were you there?

33:08.103 --> 33:10.807
You were. What happened?

33:12.074 --> 33:15.644
Listen to me very carefully. If you want
medical attention, you start speaking now.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.113
We'll all be dead soon enough.

33:24.952 --> 33:28.223
Let's go. Please. You have
to help me get my friends.

33:29.057 --> 33:30.626
You wouldn't leave one of yours behind.

33:30.727 --> 33:34.163
We're marines. We've sworn to
die for each other if we have to.

33:34.630 --> 33:36.165
You barely know those other people.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.067
They're only here because of me.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.405
I'll make you a deal.

33:55.381 --> 33:56.950
Oh, Shed.

34:03.221 --> 34:04.891
Hey, are you okay?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.628
You came back?

34:10.195 --> 34:11.230
Of course I did.

34:11.331 --> 34:12.899
The deal is this.

34:13.364 --> 34:15.835
You will all testify that
Mars had nothing to do

34:15.934 --> 34:17.536
with the Canterbury's destruction.

34:18.003 --> 34:21.474
Suit up fast, the air seal
is temporary. We have to move.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.877
- What's wrong with Alex?
- He took one for the team.

34:25.744 --> 34:27.047
I'll carry him.

34:32.818 --> 34:35.355
Come on, buddy. We gotta suit up.

34:39.992 --> 34:43.897
We can't get pinned down again, we
need a clear route to the hangar bay.

34:43.996 --> 34:46.732
I'm trying, sir, but our ship
is crawling with scumbags.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.300
Lopez.

34:50.202 --> 34:51.603
Listen.

34:51.980 --> 34:53.518
We've all lost people we care about.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.356
And I don't even have a clue as to why.

34:55.974 --> 34:57.943
But I keep hearing about Phoebe Station.

34:58.043 --> 34:59.478
And if we're all going
to die because of it,

34:59.579 --> 35:02.048
can't you at least tell me
what the hell happened there?

35:03.449 --> 35:05.286
Donnager was dispatched to Phoebe Station

35:05.287 --> 35:07.050
after she went silent for several weeks.

35:08.086 --> 35:09.121
Why?

35:09.521 --> 35:11.290
We still don't know.

35:11.789 --> 35:15.195
Everyone on board was dead.
Their bodies were incinerated.

35:15.295 --> 35:18.030
We found them re-frozen to
the walls of the ice tunnels.

35:18.130 --> 35:19.699
We thought it was a
fire or a chemical spill,

35:19.798 --> 35:22.434
but then we discovered that all
the computer cores were destroyed.

35:22.768 --> 35:25.405
You mean someone did it deliberately?

35:25.505 --> 35:27.407
They were covering something up.

35:28.373 --> 35:30.275
- Like what?
- I don't know.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.082
Jesus.

35:40.920 --> 35:41.663
What happened?

35:42.300 --> 35:44.685
The Captain has set Condition Zero.

35:45.086 --> 35:46.580
She's going to scuttle the ship.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.903
Hull breach, deck four, critical.

35:58.003 --> 36:01.874
Boarders are converging on
engineering, aux, CIC and the bridge.

36:01.974 --> 36:03.442
Has the ready standby left the hangar bay?

36:03.543 --> 36:05.144
Negative, sir. It's still there.

36:14.286 --> 36:15.722
- Captain.
- Not yet.

36:16.655 --> 36:18.892
This has to count for something.

36:25.998 --> 36:27.133
Dookie ready.

36:27.398 --> 36:28.867
Grimes in position.

36:39.244 --> 36:42.414
Mag boots off. Move as fast as you can.

36:44.115 --> 36:46.786
Everybody on my mark.
Standby for cover fire.

36:47.019 --> 36:48.021
Uh-huh.

36:48.519 --> 36:51.090
Hey, hey! Don't you quit on me.

36:52.291 --> 36:53.559
All right.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.563
Ready?

36:56.662 --> 36:57.896
Go!

37:31.931 --> 37:32.898
Go!

38:41.032 --> 38:43.101
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

38:48.407 --> 38:49.675
What about the others?

38:49.775 --> 38:52.611
They're gone. We have to dust off now.

39:08.327 --> 39:11.197
I'm not a pilot. Someone else needs to fly.

39:16.601 --> 39:18.904
What? Whoa! Go. Go!

39:23.842 --> 39:28.381
Authorize full operational control of
all systems for everyone now on board.

39:31.215 --> 39:32.984
Boss, I don't think I'm
in any condition to...

39:33.085 --> 39:35.287
- Get us out of here!
- You got it.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.159
I need some juice.

39:51.936 --> 39:55.407
Okay, sweetheart, be gentle with me.

39:56.175 --> 39:58.010
This is my first time.

40:33.177 --> 40:34.614
Sorry.

40:42.387 --> 40:45.258
Evasive maneuvers. Max burn.

40:45.757 --> 40:47.592
Do not let anyone stay on our tail.

40:48.159 --> 40:51.663
You got it, hoss... I mean... Yes, sir.

40:57.235 --> 41:01.540
It would've been nice
to see an ocean on Mars.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.423
- The Tachi is away.
- Sir.

41:19.224 --> 41:21.427
Captain, this door won't hold much longer.

41:23.327 --> 41:24.996
I didn't think we could lose.

41:50.956 --> 41:53.558
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

41:54.492 --> 41:55.862
Son of a bitch!
