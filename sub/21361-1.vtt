00:09.743 --> 00:12.211
Hello?
Hey, what's up, Scotty?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.146
Sorry, I couldn't see
the screen for a second.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.482
Some fucking... like...

00:16.484 --> 00:19.451
It's hard to... sorry, man,
my allergies are going crazy.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.154
No, I was just saying,
it's hard to see the screen
in the sun sometimes.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.123
Um, anyway, dude, uh...

00:24.125 --> 00:26.725
Nothing.
I'm just walking back
from the store right now.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.727
I had to walk
fucking super far, man.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.597
Like, pretty much all the places
that typically have stuff

00:31.599 --> 00:33.399
are all, like, sold out
for the fourth of July.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.434
So all the cookout stuff
was gone.

00:35.436 --> 00:39.104
Um, anyway, man, what's up?

00:39.106 --> 00:41.340
Oh, no, no, yeah, well, shit,
normally I would've driven, man,

00:41.342 --> 00:44.476
but, no, I got a...
I got a nice-ass parking spot

00:44.478 --> 00:46.478
across the street
from the house.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.513
Uh...

00:49.349 --> 00:51.316
Oh, shit. Well, um...

00:51.318 --> 00:53.152
Which airport do you
have to pick him up at?

00:53.154 --> 00:56.055
Are you gonna be able to
make it to the cookout still?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.424
Ooh. Lax?
That's gonna fucking suck.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.725
Well, as long as you can
make it here by the time

00:59.727 --> 01:01.260
of the, um, fireworks,
you should be cool.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.263
Hang on, I'm getting
a text real quick.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.705
It's fucking Jenny texting
about chores again.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.707
It's like, dude,
you're not my roommate.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.443
You're fucking
Derek's girlfriend.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.711
Like, you know what I'm saying?
Chill out for a second.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.280
Yeah, seriously.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.082
Not that the chores
don't need to be done.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.250
But it's just like,
come on man,
set up some boundaries.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.820
Oh, hold up a second, dude.
My fucking phone's
blowing up again. Hang on.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.557
Shit.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.459
Hey, Derek, what's up, man?

01:33.461 --> 01:35.861
Uh, nothing,
I'm just going for a walk.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.497
Um...

01:38.499 --> 01:41.166
No, I'm probably not getting
into too much today.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.668
Um...

01:42.670 --> 01:44.203
Yeah, well, uh--

01:44.205 --> 01:46.305
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.108
No, the guy who did the graphics
for us said the check
will be here super soon.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.876
So I'll be able
to take care of the rent.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.180
Well, technically,
I'm not two months late.

01:55.182 --> 01:57.516
It's a month and four days now.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.252
Um... oh, shit. Actually,
Mia's locked in the gate.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.887
I forgot, no one was here
to let her out.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.655
But hey, man, have--
have a good trip, man.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.324
And... yeah, as soon as
the check comes, I'll...

02:05.326 --> 02:06.558
You locked me in.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.526
Obviously,
I'll take care of it. Um...

02:08.529 --> 02:10.362
But hey, I gotta go.
I gotta let Mia out.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.264
Um, but yeah,
have a good trip, man.
I'll talk to you soon.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.800
--All right, bye.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.468
Scotty, you still there?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.637
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.607
-I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.
-All right.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.275
Um, do you think you'll be back
in time for the fireworks?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.843
I don't know.
Just depends how busy we are.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.712
Ok. Yeah, well, have fun.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.581
Or as much fun as work is.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.318
Uh, sorry.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.387
No, just letting Mia out.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.588
No, just letting Mia out.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.293
God damn it.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.329
- Nothing.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.698
Checking for that check again.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.401
Do you know
if they even deliver mail
on the fourth of July?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.639
Yeah, I didn't think so.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.808
Uh, no, it was cool.
She spent the night. Um...

02:56.810 --> 02:58.477
Yeah.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.679
She just keeps pressuring me
to try to move in with her.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.481
Which is-- I mean,
would be cool,

03:02.483 --> 03:06.318
but I kinda just prefer still
having my own space, you know?

03:06.320 --> 03:09.821
Even though Derek's
kind of a...
Kind of a fucking dick.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.658
Or he's not even a dick, really.
He's just...

03:12.660 --> 03:16.762
You know, I think
we were better friends
than roommates, essentially.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.966
But... literally got like
68 bucks in the bank
until that check comes.

03:22.468 --> 03:23.468
Um...

03:23.470 --> 03:24.803
Fuck it.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.272
Uh, yeah, man, I got this
big-ass thing of meat

03:27.274 --> 03:29.341
that I'm gonna thaw
that I'm hyped about.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.409
Um...

03:30.411 --> 03:31.410
Fuck!

03:33.446 --> 03:35.480
I forgot the lighter fluid
at the store.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.384
No, I already bought
that lighter fluid,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.887
but I left it on the counter
when I left the store.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.890
I just totally straight-up
brain farted and left it.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.692
Um...

03:46.694 --> 03:48.360
So, yeah, I already
paid for it, so...

03:51.464 --> 03:53.599
Typically I would,
but, no, I already paid for it,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.634
so I wanna go back and get it.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.402
I don't know,
it's like a super short drive,
but a long-ass walk.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.705
Plus I have, like,
no goddamn gas anyway.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.940
I still got a bunch of shit
i need to get ready
for the cookout,

04:01.942 --> 04:06.745
so I'm trying, like,
to not waste as much time
walking over there again.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.248
Uh...

04:09.250 --> 04:13.518
Uh, maybe. I don't know.
Like, Derek's bike is, like,
his most prized possession.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.921
Yeah, it's fixie.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.890
He probably
wouldn't be too hyped
if I borrowed his bike.

06:04.664 --> 06:05.897
Why you in the road?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.100
-You're not a car.
-Ok, go around.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.568
You're not even a motorcycle.
You're a fucking bike.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.103
Get on the goddamn sidewalk.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.838
Fucking bilbo Baggins over here.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.840
- I'm not even short.
-You're not special.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.007
You ain't aerosmith.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.476
- Just go!
-I can run you over.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.511
-Whatever, dude.
-Hipster bullshit.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.512
Fucker.

06:22.415 --> 06:23.415
Fucking truck nuts?

06:44.036 --> 06:45.837
--Fuck.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.839
Yeah, what's up?
We're not on the road no more.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.774
What's up now?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.910
-Nothing.
-What's up? You got shit to say?

06:51.912 --> 06:55.113
Nothing's... nothing's been up.
Just go.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.782
Go where?
What, you're just gonna
tell me where to go?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.049
I know where
the fuck I wanna go.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.052
-Great. Then go there.
-You was talking shit.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.689
You got something to say?

07:04.691 --> 07:06.191
Talk some shit now.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.959
-I'm just--
-say something to my face.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.995
I'm just going to the store.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.530
My face is right here.
We ain't on the road,
we're right here.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.697
-Great.
-We're right here.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.466
-Yeah, you're right.
-Right now.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.901
-You're very observant.
-Let's do it. What's up?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.436
-What-- ok, yeah.
-You wanna piece?

07:17.438 --> 07:19.137
We're hanging out. This is cool.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.906
I ain't hanging out with you.
I don't wanna hang out with you.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.140
- Ok, then, goodbye.
- -This ain't a session.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.942
We're not friends.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.178
-This ain't nickelodeon.
-That's true. That's right.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.813
-Ain't <i> high school musical.</i>
-I'm not Chandler,
you're not Monica.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.481
I ain't gonna break out
and sing a song with you.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.149
- I ain't gonna break dance.
- -Awesome. Great.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.951
We ain't gonna play basketball
and get in the school play.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.686
- Awesome. Ok. Thank you.
- What's up?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.922
-Nothing's up. Just go, dude.
-Come on, floppy hair.

07:36.924 --> 07:37.923
Don't tell me where to go.

07:37.925 --> 07:38.990
You go.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.158
Then stay. I don't give a fuck.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.993
No, no, I am staying. You go.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.161
-All right.
-You go.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.497
-Bye.
-Oh, so you're gonna go?

07:45.499 --> 07:46.998
Yeah, you're a weirdo, dude.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Bitch-ass mother.
You would run, wouldn't you?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.836
I'm not running.
I'm being a normal person.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.737
Like a bitch.
Like a little bitch.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.574
I'm being a normal person
going about my--
whatever, dude.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.842
-You look like a girl.
-Go fuck yourself, dude.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.109
Fuck myself?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.644
Yeah. There's an activity
for you to do.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.645
- I'll fuck your mom.
- -Ok, terrific.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.880
Yeah.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.149
Run back to castle black,
Jon snow.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.117
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.919
Smack the shit out of you.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.225
Hey, what's up, man?
Um, I came in here
a little bit ago--

08:13.227 --> 08:15.527
-no-- no bikes in here.
-Um...

08:15.529 --> 08:17.696
Skateboarders come in and
they scuff up the whole floor.
There's no bikes.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.965
Sorry, I just...
I don't have a lock.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.501
-Doesn't change the rules here.
-So I just don't feel safe
putting it outside.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.936
Basically, this dude was, like,
chasing me in his truck.
It doesn't matter. But like--

08:24.938 --> 08:26.838
no, it doesn't matter.
No bikes in here.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.809
-Sorry, I don't have a lock.
-There's no bikes in here.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.179
These are actually
different sort of wheels
than, uh, than skateboards.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.714
So I don't think it would...

08:35.716 --> 08:38.116
-The bike stays outside.
-All right.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.684
I just-- there was just a dude
chasing me in a truck.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.953
Plus, I don't want--
all right.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.825
I can hold it up
so it doesn't touch.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.759
All right.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.919
It's out front.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.022
Um, like, I came in here
about an hour ago
and I bought lighter fluid,

09:17.024 --> 09:20.759
but I forgot--
like, I bought charcoal also,
but I forgot the lighter fluid.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.661
But I already paid for it.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.329
Um, oh, actually, I think
that's the one right there.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.565
Great, you got a receipt?

09:26.567 --> 09:27.933
Uh...

09:30.069 --> 09:32.037
Actually, I don't.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.172
I'm pretty sure I don't
because you, um,
like, handed it to me

09:34.174 --> 09:36.841
sort of, like, in this
taco-y way,
you know what I'm saying?

09:36.843 --> 09:40.045
Ok. I've never--
I've never heard
"taco-y way" before.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.746
Like, you handed it
to me in a way

09:41.748 --> 09:43.114
where you put, like,
the cash down
and a receipt on top

09:43.116 --> 09:44.950
and then, like, the change
on top of that.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.184
And then there was, like,
a bunch of people
in line behind me,

09:46.186 --> 09:47.953
so I had to, like, cup it
into my pocket.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.055
If you don't have the receipt,
then it's not yours.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.190
Well, I'm saying
i did have the receipt
and it probably--

09:52.192 --> 09:53.658
I don't-- it's probably
on the floor here

09:53.660 --> 09:55.093
because I dropped
all the stuff

09:55.095 --> 09:56.995
-'cause it was, like--
-i don't remember you.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.230
Maybe it's 'cause
you're wearing
sunglasses indoors.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.666
But I don't remember you.
I still don't remember you.
None of us remember you.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.101
I was wearing sunglasses
because I came off the bike.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.170
-I forgot I had them on.
-I don't care.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.138
If you had your receipt,
I'd give you the product
you say is yours.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.640
I did have the receipt.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.609
Like, the thing is,
when you handed it to me,

10:10.611 --> 10:11.843
like, I had to, like,
sort of taco it and, like,
cup it into my pocket.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.178
Why don't you
buy pants that fit

10:13.180 --> 10:14.980
instead of this skinny thing

10:14.982 --> 10:17.782
and then everything wouldn't
just slide down your leg?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.818
If you don't have it,
you don't have it, ok?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.052
Sorry. Uh...

10:22.688 --> 10:24.322
Is there anybody else here
i can talk to?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.957
Because I paid for that.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.727
No, I'm the manager.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.695
Do you wanna buy it,
or should I sell things

10:30.697 --> 10:33.231
to the person behind you?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.933
All right,
I'll just buy it again.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.704
$3.62.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.206
This is literally my last cash.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.407
Great story.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.045
--Here's your change.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.113
$1.38.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.882
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.420
This receipt was in the bag.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.325
- Fuck it.

11:01.694 --> 11:02.827
How can I help you?

11:04.096 --> 11:05.764
What the fuck?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.999
- What the funny now?
- -Jesus Christ.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.101
-Yeah, you like that, bitch?
-What the fuck?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.203
What you gonna do now, huh?

11:13.874 --> 11:16.341
Aw! Sorry about
your bike, pee-wee.

11:17.778 --> 11:18.710
Fucking--

11:25.117 --> 11:26.451
fucking-a.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.331
Uh, hi. Um, I need
to report something.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.234
Um, uh, this guy just ran--

11:43.236 --> 11:45.103
I don't know if this counts
as, like, an
emergency emergency,

11:45.105 --> 11:47.338
but this dude just
ran over my bike.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.875
Then the-- no, then the dude
just took off.
I don't know here he went.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.879
I don't know. It was like
a-- no, no. It was like a
black pickup truck.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.750
And, um, it had, uh--
i didn't get the plate
or anything like that.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.351
No, it was just too crazy.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.253
Oh.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.722
You know what?

12:03.724 --> 12:07.025
It actually-- it had,
um, it had truck nuts.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.426
It's like these
fleshy-looking testicles

12:08.428 --> 12:10.395
that hang off
the back of a-- of a car.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.931
Or most times,
they're on, like, pickup trucks
and stuff like that.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.199
No, it's like a real thing.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.401
Are you by a computer?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.437
Yeah, I was just saying--
yeah, yeah.
You could Google it or whatever.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.306
Anyway, that was just
the main distinguishing feature
of the truck

12:21.308 --> 12:22.974
is that it had testicles.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.076
Hello?

12:26.812 --> 12:27.979
What the fuck?

12:29.315 --> 12:30.348
Fucking-a.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.819
Learn what truck nuts are.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.254
Hey, Scotty?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.556
Hey, can you hear me?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.358
What's up, dude? Um...

13:13.360 --> 13:14.359
Hey, man.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.263
I got fucking--
the bike?

13:18.265 --> 13:21.332
Some road rage dude
drove over the bike.

13:21.334 --> 13:25.069
It's, like,
straight-up fucked up.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.972
Yeah, the bike. Derek's special
favorite bike, it's destroyed.
Well anyways, sorry.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.541
Um...

13:29.543 --> 13:32.544
Have you left yet for
lax to pick up mark?

13:32.546 --> 13:35.113
Oh, shit.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.382
I was-- yeah, no, I gonna ask if
you could give me a ride

13:37.384 --> 13:41.085
back to my place
because I'm dragging
this busted bike.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.555
Is there no way
you could swing by
and grab me right now

13:43.557 --> 13:45.023
and just give me a lift?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.091
Ok.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.527
Uh...

13:49.529 --> 13:51.863
Eh, I guess
i could do an uber.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.333
I just-- I don't know.
Doing a car service.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.235
I hate, fucking, that stuff.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.070
I've done it before.
Well, I haven't done it.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.839
Like, every time
I've ridden in an uber,

14:00.841 --> 14:02.540
um, Mia did it
with her phone.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.077
No, I'll figure it out.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.080
Yeah, have fun
picking up mark.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.384
Well, he is technically
your family now.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.321
Yeah, all right man.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.356
All right, later. Bye.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.313
Yeah, I'm just running
a few minutes late

14:42.315 --> 14:43.648
because I'm checking
my map, and it says--

14:43.650 --> 14:45.617
hey, I didn't know
how to do it on the app,

14:45.619 --> 14:47.952
but I have a--
a bike with me.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.520
-I don't know if you could
pop the trunk.
-What're you talking about?

14:49.522 --> 14:51.990
-I got the uber. The uber thing.
-I'm not a fucking uber!

14:51.992 --> 14:54.259
Hello? Get your hand off
my fucking car.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.061
Ok, sorry.
Your car looked like--

14:57.063 --> 14:58.630
you look
like fucking carrot top.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.999
-What do you think of that?
-Great.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.934
- Your car looked like an uber.
- -Asshole.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.270
Jesus, fucking carrot top
just tried to climb
in my fucking car.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.546
-Hey, are you Jamie?
-Yeah are you the uber?

15:15.548 --> 15:16.614
Of course, I'm Patrick.
What's up?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.116
Hey.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.550
I didn't know
how to do it on the app,

15:19.552 --> 15:20.685
but I have a bike with me.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.654
Is it cool if I pop it
in the trunk?

15:22.656 --> 15:25.523
Uh, I guess,
if you have to, sure.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.992
I'll just toss it
in the back and we'll roll.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.930
Ok, please be careful.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.131
Make sure that bag
is sealed, though.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.299
I don't want anything
spilling out.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.934
Yeah.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.169
Ok, easy-- easy now.
Easy now, all right?

15:38.171 --> 15:41.639
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up, back up, back up.
Back up, please.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.176
Try to not let the wheel
touch the roof of the car.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.046
- Ok, sorry.
- -Ok. Eas-- ooh! Ok.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.381
I can't have
any scratches or any tears.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.150
Can I put this
old yoga mat up here?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.152
Uh, that's really
for my body, but sure.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.020
Be careful,
do not shove it in there.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.122
All right, you're--
you're hitting
the-- the seat again.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.390
Can you not shove it in there?

15:59.392 --> 16:03.127
Nope.
I mean, yeah. Sorry. I, uh...

16:03.129 --> 16:06.164
Shoot.
I'm gonna take the tire off.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.099
Nice and slow here, ok?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.968
Push the seat down.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.303
Someone drove over my bike,
so I can't lay it
that far back.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.539
Please do not ram it
into the chair like that.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.740
-Ok.
-Lay it a littler flatter.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.141
Easy, easy. Don't slam.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.616
Sorry about that.
I've been stuck
with this bike all day.

16:25.618 --> 16:30.555
Um... oh, shit, dude, dude,
that's the truck
that ran over my bike.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.023
Just follow that.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.125
I kinda need
an address for my GPS.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.626
I'll tell you in
a second, but just go right
and follow that truck.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.128
First things first,
do you need gum?

16:37.130 --> 16:39.397
Uh, no, no, no,
just follow the truck.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.698
I don't want gum.
I don't want gum.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.200
Do you need water?
I got water too.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.434
I don't want water.
Just follow the truck.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.036
So you don't want a water?

16:45.038 --> 16:46.371
I'll take a water,
but follow the truck.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.439
Who are you talking about?
What truck?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.376
The dude-- all right.
The dude who ran over my bike.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.744
His truck is ahead of us.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.612
I need to get
the license plate number

16:54.614 --> 16:56.381
so I can report it
to the police.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.715
Ok. I don't see a truck.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.484
Can you describe the truck

16:59.486 --> 17:01.452
so that I can understand
what you're talking about?

17:01.454 --> 17:05.589
Take a--
it's a-- it's like a...
A black truck.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.392
Like a new one. It's big.

17:07.394 --> 17:11.128
The driver's probably, like,
a black guy, mid 30s.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.296
Late 20s, maybe.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.198
And he had, like,
a gray tank top on.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.267
I'm sorry, what does
the color of his skin
have to do with it?

17:16.269 --> 17:17.702
I'm just describing him.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.771
I don't have any--
it doesn't mean anything.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.440
Ok, but it was the way
you said it that sounded...

17:22.442 --> 17:24.742
Well, I didn't mean
anything by it.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.111
I'm just talking about--
oh, there he is! There he is!
He's, like, three cars up.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
We just need
to get close enough.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.448
Ok, 'cause I'm not trying to
racially profile anyone here.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.749
You're not
racially profiling anybody.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.619
I saw the dude do it.
It's just...

17:34.621 --> 17:36.120
I'm pretty sure that's it.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.755
Ok. I just--

17:37.757 --> 17:41.793
it's got, like, peach-colored
fleshy truck nuts on the back.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.461
If he's supposedly black,

17:43.463 --> 17:46.097
why would his truck nuts
be white?

17:46.099 --> 17:47.231
They might've--
i don't know.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.599
Maybe he likes
white truck nuts.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.301
Or maybe that was all
that was available.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.702
Ok, so it seems like
you don't know a lot

17:51.704 --> 17:53.571
about what's going on
right now.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.406
I know that
that's the dude
and that's the truck.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.375
If we can get by
to see the license plate,

17:57.377 --> 17:59.310
I can get a photo
of it and report it.
That's it! That's it!

17:59.312 --> 18:00.778
Why are we
following this person?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.147
Because he drove
over my bicycle.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.782
-Did he know it was your bike?
-And he was yelling at me.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.717
He was the asshole, dude.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.654
Calm down, all right.
I'm gonna pull over
until you calm down.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.522
There's no need for that.
See up there?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.591
I can see his dangling
truck nuts right now.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.760
But i--
just get me close enough
to see the license plate.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.762
-Ok.
-He's going over the hill.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.864
Oh, my god,
just please get close enough.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.699
I swear to god.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.203
You are pushing me
and I'm about
to let you off right now.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.538
Please get close.
He's turning right now.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.140
Ok, I think...

18:29.142 --> 18:31.476
He just-- he just turned right
by that highway sign.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.211
-By that highway sign.
-Get on the highway?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.445
No, no, no!

18:34.447 --> 18:36.147
I said he turned right
by the highway sign.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.382
-He did not get on the high--
-I'm sorry. But, um...

18:38.384 --> 18:40.118
Can you get off the--

18:40.120 --> 18:41.853
I'm sorry,
but I do not like
your attitude right now.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.322
I don't like the way
you're speaking to me
in my own car.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.291
Next exit,
I'm dropping you off, ok?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.360
I-- that's not--
i need to get home.

18:49.362 --> 18:53.464
Well, you can figure that out
with another driver.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.867
Well, could you please
just drop me off at my house?

18:55.869 --> 18:57.702
It's 284 parkview.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.905
You can keep talking,
but I'm done talking to you.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.643
This is ridiculous, dude.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.712
Hello?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.614
<i> Used by Jennifer opel</i>
<i> and engineered by...</i>

19:09.616 --> 19:11.315
Dude, this is a car service.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.384
I'm not asking you to do
anything not in reason.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.187
So part of that service is
for you to not yell at me

19:16.189 --> 19:17.522
the way you've
been yelling at me.

19:17.524 --> 19:21.392
For you not be sending me
on a wild goose chase.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.295
You know, um,
making, uh, racist comments.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.697
I was not saying anything racist.
That doesn't make any sense.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.232
Oh, you absolutely
were being racist.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.500
How was I being racist?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.270
You're persecuting
a black man.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.638
He's the guy who did it!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.573
His race has nothing
to do with it.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.542
It's purely a description
of the guy

19:37.544 --> 19:39.310
we were trying
to follow, which you,

19:39.312 --> 19:41.779
for whatever reason,
could not get your--
anything together.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.615
There's a great
upworthy.Com post
about racial profiling,

19:44.617 --> 19:46.617
and this is exactly what
they were talking about.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.352
If I described
your car as silver,

19:48.354 --> 19:50.221
that doesn't mean
i have a thing
against silver cars.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.323
I'm talking about
your fucking individual car.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.626
Save it for the next
kkk rally that you go to.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.429
-This is bullshit, dude.
-You can get out here.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.765
I'm not getting out here.
I don't know where we are.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.801
There is no other uber
driver coming for you.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.369
I'm going to make sure of that.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.972
And you are charged
86 dollars.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.740
Eighty fucking six dollars?
That's bullshit!

20:09.742 --> 20:11.375
It's called
surge hour services

20:11.377 --> 20:13.311
and that's what's
happening today.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.316
-Wh-- it's the afternoon.
-It's the fourth of July.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.484
I don't even have
that much money.
I have, like, 68 bucks.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.620
You plugged in
the 3.5 into the app

20:22.622 --> 20:24.488
when you confirmed the charge.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.791
I thought that meant,
like, I'd wait three
and a half minutes

20:26.793 --> 20:29.527
for you or something.
I can't see-- I couldn't see
the goddamn screen in the sun.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.696
It's already been charged.
It's 86 dollars.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.531
Thanks for taking
all my goddamn money.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.866
Open the fucking trunk
so I can get my bike out.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.637
Ask me politely.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.573
Will you please open
the trunk for me

20:42.575 --> 20:46.811
so I can retrieve my bicycle
that that guy ran over?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.246
There you go.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.420
So you'll be getting
a receipt via email.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.722
Great.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.390
As well as
an optional online survey.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.759
If you could do me a solid
and give me a high rating,

21:01.761 --> 21:03.661
I'd really appreciate it. Ok?

21:03.663 --> 21:07.665
Also, um, if you're on Twitter,
you can just help me out

21:07.667 --> 21:11.769
by tweeting "hashtag
uber Patrick rules." Ok?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.671
Hashtag, go fuck yourself.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.647
My fucking lighter fluid.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.996
Hey, what's up, dude?
I was hoping you
would answer. Um...

21:38.998 --> 21:40.765
Anyway, man. Um...

21:40.767 --> 21:43.334
Give me a call back
as soon as you get this.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.970
Um, I don't know if
you already picked mark up

21:45.972 --> 21:49.740
or if you're still at the
airport or on the way
or whatever, but um...

21:49.742 --> 21:52.510
But, dude,
I'm gonna, uh...

21:52.512 --> 21:55.046
I'm definitely gonna need you
to come pick me up. Um...

21:55.048 --> 21:57.481
Some...
Some insane shit happened.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.951
Um, the uber driver dude
was crazy.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.820
I mean, not like--
well, I don't know.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.455
Like, annoying crazy.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.791
It's too long to explain
in a fucking voicemail,

22:06.793 --> 22:09.026
but we got into an argument
and he kicked me out.

22:09.028 --> 22:13.564
And, uh, anyway, the fucking
dick head dropped me off

22:13.566 --> 22:16.067
and essentially...

22:16.069 --> 22:18.402
Fuckin'... took--

22:18.404 --> 22:20.671
basically,
all my money's gone

22:20.673 --> 22:22.873
and has been spent
on car service.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.508
So that's nice.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.045
Um, shit, I gotta find a place
to fucking take a piss.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.747
So, um,

22:29.749 --> 22:31.949
I'm gonna go try to find
a bathroom for a second.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.386
And then, uh, when I find that,
uh, hopefully I'll have
an address to give you

22:35.388 --> 22:37.421
and you can come pick me up.
But uh...

22:37.423 --> 22:40.658
Anyway,
just give me a call, man.
I've got, like-- I've only got

22:40.660 --> 22:43.127
I've got $1.38 left.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.731
Um, total. To-- to my name.

22:46.733 --> 22:50.601
So I don't even have enough
for a bus anymore, so, uh...

22:52.070 --> 22:54.071
Anyway, call me back
when you get this, man.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.840
I hope you're on your way back.
All right.

22:55.842 --> 22:56.974
Later man, bye.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.395
Seriously?

23:19.431 --> 23:20.431
Fucking turn.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.187
Hello?

23:44.723 --> 23:45.723
Hello?

23:47.159 --> 23:48.192
Hello?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.867
Hi, do you guys have
a public restroom,
by any chance?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.103
No? All right.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.504
Do you guys have a bathroom?

24:01.540 --> 24:02.573
No? Ok.

24:07.145 --> 24:10.815
- Do you guys have a bathroom?
- -No.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.617
Hello? Do you guys have
a bathroom, by any chance?

24:13.619 --> 24:15.719
Do you have a bathroom,
by any chance?

24:15.721 --> 24:16.954
No, ok. Thanks.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.202
Sorry.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.245
What's up, man?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.047
Is it all right if I bring
this in here for a second?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.782
-It's just a bike.
-I don't give a fuck.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.852
Um, do you guys have a restroom
i could use super quick?

24:47.854 --> 24:50.688
I've been hopping around,
looking for a spot and I can't.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.922
No one seems to have one.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.824
We do,
but it's for customers only.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.894
Ok. Um...

24:56.896 --> 24:59.163
Is it cool if i-- if I use
the restroom first

24:59.165 --> 25:01.098
and then buy something
on the way?

25:01.100 --> 25:03.968
I'll buy something for sure.
I just need to go really bad.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.804
-It's customers only.
-Ok. Uh, yeah.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.074
Sorry, I just have
to go super bad. Um...

25:10.076 --> 25:13.277
Do you guys, uh...
Do you guys have
lighter fluid by any chance?

25:13.279 --> 25:16.247
- Yeah, yeah, we do.
- Do you know how much it costs?
Just offhand?

25:16.249 --> 25:18.682
I don't know,
like four dollars.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.653
Aw, shit. Um...

25:22.655 --> 25:26.790
Do you guys have anything
that's, like,
just a dollar or less?

25:26.792 --> 25:30.160
It's easier if you check
the price tags.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.962
None of this stuff
has price tags on it.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.297
That's the only reason I ask.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.938
So how much are
the candy bars?
Are they like a dollar?

25:40.940 --> 25:43.774
- Yeah, a dollar.
-It was Adrien Brody.

25:43.776 --> 25:47.111
And he was dj'ing
and we watched him
do this entire dj set.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.280
No, he did look good.
That's what was surprising.

25:49.282 --> 25:53.617
He did look good,
and it was amazing. Excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

25:53.619 --> 25:56.720
-It's for customers only.
-Are you serious?

25:56.722 --> 25:57.655
Seriously?

25:59.024 --> 26:00.257
- Yeah.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.061
This guy is being
so mean to me right now.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.996
He's being so-- I know.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.665
No, i-- I know.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.567
Hey, excuse me. Hi.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.235
So, I'm Stacy.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.672
Can I please
use the bathroom?

26:14.674 --> 26:17.174
You'll be, like, my best friend
in the whole world.

26:17.176 --> 26:20.811
Like, I will never forget you.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.012
All right, go ahead.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.847
You are am-
he's amazing.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.016
He's now being nice.
You're amazing. I am--

26:26.018 --> 26:27.651
you're my favorite
store person right now.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.787
-You're amazing.
-All right, Stacy.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.221
- Fuck.
- -Sorry.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.123
Anyways, when Adrien
started spinning,

26:33.125 --> 26:36.126
I was like,
i want to fuck him.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.128
Awesome. Uh...

26:38.130 --> 26:41.799
So I guess that means
i probably don't have
to buy this too?

26:41.801 --> 26:44.301
-That's a dollar.
-Cool. Of course it is.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.245
Yo.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.247
Yo, bathroom's one at a time.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.782
That's fine with me.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.784
I'm not trying to be
in there with her.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.200
I'd fuck her.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.736
-Cool.
-Like you wouldn't?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.738
I don't know, whatever.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.407
I'm just waiting
for the-- I'm just waiting
for the bathroom.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.043
- Trying to get my dick wet.
- -Great.

27:26.045 --> 27:31.081
She always wears
the same thing as me
and it's like...

27:33.285 --> 27:36.286
When Adrien Brody was dj'ing,

27:36.288 --> 27:37.955
he made eye contact with me.

27:37.957 --> 27:41.759
I counted, like, six times,
but I'm pretty sure.

27:41.761 --> 27:46.163
No, it wasn't
anyone next to me.
It was me.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.066
He looked me right in
the eye and I was like...

27:50.436 --> 27:51.735
Oh, my god.

27:51.737 --> 27:52.870
What?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.171
Are you gonna be much longer?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.107
I actually need
to use the restroom.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.375
And I'm using it right now,

27:58.377 --> 28:01.011
so that's kinda
how this works.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.081
Sounds like
you're just talking
on the phone a bunch.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.351
Yeah, because
i have-- I'm multitasking.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.053
Wow.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.988
Yeah, something
you probably can't do.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.790
Yeah,
you got me again.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.394
You need to, like, stop creeping
right now, ok?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.129
And, like, wait your turn.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.298
-I'm not creeping. I just--
-you need to wait your turn.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.367
Ok, but I actually need
to use the bathroom.
It sounds like--

28:23.369 --> 28:25.936
I actually need
to use the bathroom too.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.204
Sounds like you're just
talking on the phone

28:27.206 --> 28:28.372
and not even
using the bathroom.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.873
Whatever.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.809
Ok. Whatever.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.912
You got in there
because you kinda cut
in front of me before anyway.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.948
Cut in front?
Oh, my god, you heard him right?

28:37.950 --> 28:40.184
Cut in front of you?
Are you, like,
five years old?

28:40.186 --> 28:42.786
I'm not five years old,
I'm a grown up.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.188
--Ok.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.859
- I'm am adult.
- -He's a psycho.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.763
-Why's your bike all fucked up?
-A dude drove over it.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.267
Tight.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.270
I'm definitely
not gonna get my hair wet
because I don't want to.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.439
So are you done taking
the world's biggest shit yet?

29:04.110 --> 29:05.843
He thinks
that I'm shitting,

29:05.845 --> 29:07.745
which is gross.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.213
Then what are you doing?

29:09.215 --> 29:11.148
I don't shit.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.351
Great. That makes sense
because you're full of it.

29:14.353 --> 29:19.223
Wow.
Are you a comedian?
Is that what you do?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.959
I'm just a guy
who actually needs
to use the bathroom.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.360
To take a shit?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.928
I need to take a piss.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.097
You're a fucking dude.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.366
Go outside,
whip your cock out

29:29.368 --> 29:31.301
and fucking piss
all over things.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.803
I was trying to be
a decent person,

29:32.805 --> 29:34.838
but all right,
fine, maybe I will.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.140
- Yeah.
-This is fucking stupid.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.008
And you know what?
You're dumb.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.346
You're dumbing.

30:06.038 --> 30:06.937
Fuck.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.144
Sir, we need you to
step away from the wall,

30:14.146 --> 30:17.214
put your hands over your head
and turn around slowly.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.183
Um...

30:19.185 --> 30:21.585
Sir, you heard me.
I need you to turn
around slowly.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.354
-Put your hands over your head.
-I have my dick out.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.522
You have your what?

30:25.524 --> 30:27.124
I have my dick out.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.892
Why is your dick out, sir?

30:28.894 --> 30:31.929
-I don't know.
-Turn around, slowly.

30:31.931 --> 30:35.032
-Can I put it away first?
-Hands up, turn around.

30:36.868 --> 30:38.402
What the hell
are you doing?

30:38.404 --> 30:39.503
I had to pee.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.338
So I was peeing.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.873
Close that up.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.942
-Slowly.
-It's buttons, not a zipper.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.144
I know, I know, I see.
Thank you.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.980
I was trying to pee
in the store,

30:49.982 --> 30:51.181
but you had to buy something.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.183
You too cheap
to buy something?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.985
No, no, no,
i bought something.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.454
I bought a snickers
and then I went
to use the bathroom

30:57.456 --> 31:00.023
and this, like, annoying girl
got in the bathroom
in front of me

31:00.025 --> 31:02.025
and she, like, wouldn't leave.
She was pretty much...

31:02.027 --> 31:04.862
So you came outside
and showed yourself
to the entire neighborhood.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.163
No, I showed myself
to the wall.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.131
Get your hands
against the wall.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.900
I don't know
what she was doing,
but she was taking forever

31:09.902 --> 31:11.869
and then, like, so I pretty much
had no choice

31:11.871 --> 31:15.038
and I had to come outside
and pee out here,
you know what I mean?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.573
No, I don't.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.041
-What's this?
-That's the snickers I bought.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.243
That's the one
i was telling you about.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.511
I bought that so
i could use the bathroom

31:21.513 --> 31:24.047
because you had
to be a patron.
So, that's like...

31:24.049 --> 31:26.316
That's brand new.
That's the one I bought inside.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.985
I just bought that. Like...

31:27.987 --> 31:29.586
Ok.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.455
You understand
the ramifications

31:31.457 --> 31:33.023
of what you are
doing here today?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.224
Obviously not.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.095
Do you realize that because
of your act out here

31:38.097 --> 31:40.364
with your little tallywacker
hanging out...

31:40.366 --> 31:45.168
You got indecent exposure
because you couldn't hold it.

31:45.170 --> 31:48.572
That puts you on a list
with all other child offenders.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.673
I wasn't doing
anything sexual.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.141
I just needed
to use the bathroom.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.643
You got your weenie out
in public.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.511
Are you kidding me?

31:54.513 --> 31:57.648
Anybody could've walked by.
A little kid could've walked.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.216
See my bike over there?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.184
I actually called
the police earlier today

32:01.186 --> 32:03.453
because there was, like,
a road rage incident,

32:03.455 --> 32:06.356
where this dude drove over
my bike in a parking lot.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.525
He drove over your bike.
Did you get
a license plate number?

32:08.527 --> 32:10.427
Did you get
a make of the car?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.529
It was all happening
pretty fast
and it was insane.

32:12.531 --> 32:13.530
Quiet.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.501
Well, here's your citation.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.469
I'm not a sex offender
is all I'm saying.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.239
You know what, junior?
There's a phone number on there.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.708
There's a website that'll
tell you what you need to do.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.610
Do you know what
the price is for the fee?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.445
Which part of...

32:28.447 --> 32:29.513
Go to the website.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.049
Call the phone number.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.717
Ok. I got it. I got it.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.620
Ok, I got it. Yes.
Go to the website.
I'll go to the website.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.458
Warning.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.328
Don't ever let me
catch you do that again.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.496
-Have a great fourth of July.
-All right.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.664
Never again.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.148
<i> Hey, Scotty.</i>

33:05.150 --> 33:06.583
Hey, dude.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.753
Dude, I just got
a big-ass ticket
for taking a piss.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.022
Like these--

33:12.024 --> 33:14.424
like, these police busted me
for peeing on a wall.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.393
Um, hey man, if you've already
picked up mark

33:16.395 --> 33:18.395
or you're cruising around
or whatever,

33:18.397 --> 33:21.465
is there any way
you could come pick me up?

33:21.467 --> 33:23.300
Oh, awesome. All right.
Well, shit.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.370
If it's delayed, yeah, yeah,
that'd be great. Yeah. Um...

33:26.372 --> 33:30.307
I'm by this place called, uh,
song's automotive.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.109
If you just Google that name,

33:32.111 --> 33:33.677
it'll take you right here.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.712
Just look up the address.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.248
Yeah, dude. Uh, yeah.
I'll just meet you over there.

33:45.656 --> 33:49.226
Hey, the bathroom's free now
if you wanna use it.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.596
Great, not necessary. Thanks.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.765
-How's your bike?
-It's doing wonderful.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.767
His bike is
literally falling apart.

33:56.769 --> 33:59.169
I'm glad you're done taking
the world's biggest shit.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.370
Ok.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.538
-Whatever.
-Goddamn.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.376
I guess if I need
to bring sangria, I will, but--

34:06.378 --> 34:08.078
oh, my god,
i think he's following me.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.112
I'm not following you, Jesus.

34:10.114 --> 34:13.250
He is so--
i need to take
a picture of him for you,

34:13.252 --> 34:15.385
but I don't even wanna
give him that satisfaction.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.121
No, because I heard him
talking to the clerk

34:18.123 --> 34:19.456
that he wanted to fuck me.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.058
No, he did.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.326
Which is, like, I get it,
but, it's like, just,

34:23.328 --> 34:26.329
have some class
and not say it
right in front of me.

34:26.331 --> 34:29.466
I mean... no, the door was shut,
but still, he was like,

34:29.467 --> 34:30.367
whatever.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.370
Hello, Scotty?

34:35.072 --> 34:36.106
I can hardly--

34:36.108 --> 34:38.542
oh, Derek. Derek?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.110
Hey, what's up, dude?

34:40.112 --> 34:42.446
You sounded like
a robot for a second.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.481
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it was your phone.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.850
Maybe it was mine,
i don't know.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.251
Nothing. Just...

34:48.253 --> 34:49.351
What's up?

34:49.353 --> 34:51.521
No, I saw the list Jenny left.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.591
And-- she texted me
a few times too.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.493
So the chores are noted.

34:56.495 --> 35:00.397
No, no, no, just tell Jenny
she doesn't need to stop by.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.666
I'm gonna be, like, at home
the whole time just like
watching netflix

35:02.668 --> 35:06.403
and just, like, you know,
doing kind of boring shit
or whatever tonight.

35:06.405 --> 35:09.206
Don't worry, man,
your cats are good.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.708
If I had the funds
I'd totally be down
for a trip, too.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.610
Yeah.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.679
Yeah, obviously,
I'd pay rent first.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.523
-What's up man?
-Hey.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.391
Is that Derek's bike?

35:28.393 --> 35:30.794
Oh, my god, he's gonna be
so pissed off about that.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.730
I just got the wheel back on,
but now I can't get it off.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.201
Did you already pick
mark up or is he still...

35:38.203 --> 35:40.337
No, we gotta hurry up.
He's already here now.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.772
-He's called me twice already.
-All right.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.209
Plane was delayed,
but now it's landed.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.245
-So we gotta go.
-I don't know if it's gonna fit.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.779
I've got some bungees
in the trunk, dude.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.214
Just use those. We gotta go.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.855
So the uber car, he's like,
"hey, can you do me a solid.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.891
If you're on Twitter,
could you, uh, just put out

36:00.893 --> 36:04.494
hashtag uber driver
Patrick rules?"

36:04.496 --> 36:07.898
I closed the door
and I was like,
"hashtag, go fuck yourself."

36:07.900 --> 36:09.633
You said that
right to his face?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.867
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.502
I closed the door
and just said it to him.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.704
-After you closed the door?
-Like, right after.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.673
That sucks.
He probably didn't hear it.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.309
-Yeah.
-He probably didn't.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.578
--I think it's...

36:21.580 --> 36:23.680
Fucking Jenny
just texted again.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.684
She keeps texting me about,

36:27.686 --> 36:29.819
Derek left me
a list of chores

36:29.821 --> 36:35.358
and then I guess
Jenny has thought it's like,
uh, her duty to, uh...

36:35.360 --> 36:37.694
Text me on his behalf

36:37.696 --> 36:40.197
to make sure
i do the chores.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.798
She needs to chill out.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.272
Whenever I go
through this tunnel,

36:49.274 --> 36:51.975
I either hold my breath
or close my eyes.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.511
I already fucked it up
because I'm still talking,

36:54.513 --> 36:57.914
but you can either
close your eyes
or hold your breath

36:57.916 --> 37:01.551
- until the end of the tunnel.
- I just usually scream.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.485
No one's ever passed out.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.820
But the only time a guy did,

37:03.822 --> 37:05.922
there was a traffic jam
around Thanksgiving.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.592
I like these
big-ass lax letters.

37:08.594 --> 37:11.528
I bet people are gonna
start showing up
at the cookout

37:11.530 --> 37:13.697
and I'm not even
gonna be there.

37:13.699 --> 37:17.334
This is actually
the most relaxing part
of my day so far.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.369
What's mark
in town for anyway?

37:19.371 --> 37:21.271
An engineering conference.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.509
I think it's so funny
that he's technically

37:26.511 --> 37:27.811
a part of your family.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.546
Well,
yeah, technically.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.581
Legally.
Not technically. Legally.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.849
Legally is technically.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.684
Oh, whatever.
It's kinda tight though.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.354
- Sitting here, taking forever.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.955
These fuckers
are parked right here.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.491
- Jesus Christ.
- -I'm going around.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.627
Jenny just texted me again.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.328
Fuck this.

37:45.330 --> 37:48.698
What is she pointing at?
What does that mean?

37:48.700 --> 37:50.667
- We're still at one.
- -Ok, look for him.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.570
- All right.
- -Stop hugging.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.038
Oh, god, you idiots.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.440
Ok, just a head's up.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.842
Uh, mark's gonna wanna
sit in the front.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.510
He says he gets carsick, so...

38:00.512 --> 38:01.911
He gets carsick?

38:01.913 --> 38:03.880
I mean,
i don't think he does.

38:03.882 --> 38:07.450
I just think he likes
to say he gets carsick.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.451
There he is.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.691
Yo, mark!

38:14.693 --> 38:15.892
Mark!

38:15.894 --> 38:17.027
Mark!

38:18.562 --> 38:20.063
Circle around again.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.431
I like this one, I guess,

38:21.433 --> 38:24.901
just fuck it. Hop in.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.971
- Where do I put this bag?
- -Just give it to him.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.906
Oh, it doesn't work.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.541
- It doesn't go down?
-Yeah, it doesn't go down.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.679
Hey, how's it going?

38:35.681 --> 38:38.548
Oh, my god.
I'm having the worst day.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.950
- Put the thing down.
-I'm trying to.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.854
- The handle.
- -Doesn't go down.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.757
Does your bag--
does your bag handle go down?

38:47.759 --> 38:49.459
It sticks a little bit.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.495
It's always
the first thing going.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.863
Your hair's all long now.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.665
Oh, yeah, I'm growing it

38:55.667 --> 38:58.835
because I'm playing a.P. Hill
in the battle of antietam

38:58.837 --> 39:02.539
at the local civil war
reenactment society. So...

39:03.808 --> 39:05.742
Let's go to in-n-out.

39:05.744 --> 39:09.479
- Um, right now?
-Yeah, I didn't get to eat.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.115
You know, airport prices
are so expensive, so...

39:12.117 --> 39:13.983
I'm actually having a cookout.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.719
We're trying to
rollback for that.

39:15.721 --> 39:19.122
I got a big-ass thing of meat.
We're gonna cook burgers.

39:19.124 --> 39:22.792
I always eat at
in-n-out when I get to la.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.060
Anytime I get to California,

39:24.062 --> 39:25.895
I always have
in-n-out, first thing.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.464
Ok.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.765
There's the one
right by the airport.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.600
It won't take long.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.103
I don't eat meat, so.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.105
Well, they have...
They have other options there.

39:35.107 --> 39:37.140
What, like bread and pickle?

39:37.142 --> 39:38.875
Yeah.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.778
I like in-n-out fine,
but I don't have any money

39:41.780 --> 39:42.912
to get anything right now.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.814
Why don't you
buy him something?

39:44.816 --> 39:49.552
I don't like to patronize
non-vegetarian establishments.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.055
-I don't like to support that.
-Why?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.723
What do you mean?
Because I don't like
to support it.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.024
That's what I just said.
I don't like to.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.493
Doesn't make any sense.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.660
Yeah it does,
it makes total sense.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.996
Every time
i come to California,

39:59.998 --> 40:02.632
the first thing I do is
i go to in-n-out burger.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.900
I don't know
why it has to change.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.568
This is my tradition.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.570
It's just gonna take
five minutes.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.873
We're in a hurry
to get back to
an actual cookout right now,

40:09.875 --> 40:11.641
so it kinda makes more sense
to just do that.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.042
Every time
i come to California

40:13.044 --> 40:15.445
I got to
in-n-out burger, first thing.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.147
Dude,
we're not going to in-n-out.

40:41.071 --> 40:42.672
Hey, drew.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.207
Hey, what's up, dude?

40:45.476 --> 40:46.976
Uh...

40:46.978 --> 40:48.111
No, I'm not.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.646
Are you at the house now?

40:50.781 --> 40:52.916
I'm not even there yet, man.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.585
Couldn't you just
eat that in the car?
It would be a lot faster.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.187
We could get going
to the barbecue.

40:57.189 --> 40:59.656
Yeah, I can't eat in the car
because I get sick.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.891
I'm actually...

41:03.462 --> 41:05.829
I'm at an in-n-out near lax.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.664
No, no, no.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.866
We're still gonna have
burgers at the cookout.
But um...

41:12.603 --> 41:14.637
It's too much to explain.
Um...

41:14.639 --> 41:16.840
Oh, you're with Mikey?

41:16.842 --> 41:18.641
No, no, no, just wait
until I get back.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.010
Actually, don't
because if you...

41:21.012 --> 41:24.881
No, no, don't climb
over the fence,
because if you...

41:24.883 --> 41:27.817
If you do that, it locks
from the inside anyway,

41:27.819 --> 41:30.787
so even if you
climbed over to let Mikey in,

41:30.789 --> 41:34.524
you'd need the key to open it
from the inside anyway.

41:34.526 --> 41:35.792
Plus, no one's there, so...

41:35.794 --> 41:36.826
Yeah.

41:38.762 --> 41:41.898
So just-- actually, you know
what you can do?

41:41.900 --> 41:43.666
Um, just, because you've got
time to kill,

41:43.668 --> 41:44.934
you could do me a favor,

41:44.936 --> 41:48.137
if you could just stop
and get lighter fluid.

41:48.139 --> 41:53.042
You don't have to
bring anything
super special to the cookout.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.210
Just get lighter fluid.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.879
You can if you want.
I don't care.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.981
But just-- yeah,
lighter fluid, man.

42:00.584 --> 42:03.219
All right, dude. All right.
See you in a bit, bye.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.024
No lighter fluid necessary.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.260
Yeah?

42:15.132 --> 42:17.200
Why is the trunk up
like that?

42:17.202 --> 42:18.234
Oh, fuck.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.073
Fuck.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.775
- What the hell?
- -They took the wheel.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.578
Who steals a wheel?

42:28.580 --> 42:29.913
I don't know.
That fucking sucks.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.214
That was, like, the only
good part left.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.615
Derek's gonna be fucking
super pissed now.

42:32.617 --> 42:34.617
You didn't put
the lock through it?

42:34.619 --> 42:36.819
We bungeed it down.

42:36.821 --> 42:38.955
That's what
i don't like about la.
Too much crime.

42:38.957 --> 42:42.158
Is there a way
i can hook my phone up
to your stereo

42:42.160 --> 42:44.694
to listen to something?

42:44.696 --> 42:45.862
What do you want to listen to?

42:45.864 --> 42:47.931
My earbuds broke
on the plane

42:47.933 --> 42:49.933
so I wasn't able to
listen to my book on tape

42:49.935 --> 42:51.568
about the civil war.

42:51.570 --> 42:53.202
I don't wanna listen to
a book on tape right now.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.637
We're driving.

42:54.639 --> 42:56.573
Can't you listen
to it tonight?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.842
Every day,
during the conference,

42:59.844 --> 43:02.879
there's gonna be
social activities
at the end of the day.

43:02.881 --> 43:05.048
So I'm not gonna have
time to listen to it.

43:05.050 --> 43:07.216
So I have to listen to it now.

43:07.218 --> 43:09.118
Well, you don't have
to listen to it

43:09.120 --> 43:13.890
and I think now
it's probably
not a great time, so...

43:13.892 --> 43:17.694
I don't have time to
listen to this, uh,
this weekend

43:17.696 --> 43:19.729
and I need to listen
to the book on tape

43:19.731 --> 43:22.899
before I return
because I'm preparing
for my reenactment.

43:22.901 --> 43:26.035
This is my one chance
to play a.P. Hill.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.137
Ok, fine. Yeah.
Go ahead and put it on.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.607
Put on your stupid book.

43:30.609 --> 43:33.276
You have to use the adapter
and the cassette thing.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.846
You know, it hooks into
the cassette player.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.281
I remember these.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.917
I used to have
all my stuff
on cassette tape. Um...

43:40.919 --> 43:42.885
It was probably
before your time
so you don't remember that.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.320
Obviously
it's not before my time.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.990
I literally
have a cassette, so...

43:46.992 --> 43:49.192
Cassette tapes
are before your time.

43:49.194 --> 43:51.894
No, they're not.
They're literally not before my time.

43:51.896 --> 43:54.330
Uh, you know what's
before your time?
Is the civil war.

43:57.768 --> 43:59.769
<i> Ambrose Powell hill, Jr.,</i>

43:59.771 --> 44:01.704
<i> better known to most as</i>

44:01.706 --> 44:04.741

44:04.743 --> 44:07.343

44:11.282 --> 44:13.950

44:13.952 --> 44:17.754
<i> which were never heavy.</i>
<i> And sometimes--</i>

44:17.756 --> 44:20.189
shit, shit,
shit, shit, pull over.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.693
Pull over,
pull over, pull over.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.261
Stop, stop.

44:25.263 --> 44:27.330
No, guys.
You can't park here.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.398
You gotta take it
down the street.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.433
-I live here.
-Oh, no.

44:30.435 --> 44:32.335
No, you can't follow us around.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.404
Sorry, you can't just
follow us around all day.

44:34.406 --> 44:35.872
Sir, I'm not following you.

44:35.874 --> 44:37.206
-I live--
-hold on. Hold on.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.208
Police brutality, man.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.810
I'm not gonna tell
you again. I want you
back behind that line.

44:40.812 --> 44:43.179
I have a right of
non-identification.

44:43.181 --> 44:44.847
As part of article one
in the constitution.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.082
I live here.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.750
He's supposed to be here.

44:47.752 --> 44:49.352
-You know this person?
-Yeah, that's my friend, drew.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.187
His name is drew, sarge. Drew.

44:51.189 --> 44:52.722
Drew, is that right?

44:52.724 --> 44:54.123
Maybe it's right,
maybe it's not, man.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.124
Yeah.

44:56.827 --> 44:57.894
He's supposed to be here.

44:57.896 --> 45:00.063
Listen, hey, calm down.

45:00.065 --> 45:01.297
Police brutality.

45:01.299 --> 45:02.365
Listen, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

45:02.367 --> 45:03.833
Mikey, just chill out
for a second.

45:03.835 --> 45:06.069
-I live here. He's a guest.
-Right.

45:06.071 --> 45:07.770
-Of me.
-Ok.

45:07.772 --> 45:10.139
And your guest was breaking
into this residence, here.

45:10.141 --> 45:11.340
He wasn't breaking in.

45:11.342 --> 45:13.242
He had called me
that he arrived early.

45:13.244 --> 45:15.411
He thought maybe
it would be ok
to go in the front yard.

45:15.413 --> 45:19.315
Your neighbors
called us to respond
to this guy breaking in.

45:19.317 --> 45:20.983
He cut his leg
on the top of the wall.

45:20.985 --> 45:22.385
What happened to your leg?

45:22.387 --> 45:24.854
He cut his leg trying
to climb over that fence.

45:24.856 --> 45:27.423
He was trying to parkour
all over this wall here,
and your neighbors saw him.

45:27.425 --> 45:28.958
Ok, well, he has permission
to do that.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.793
He's an American,
just like you, man.

45:30.795 --> 45:33.329
He's a guest of mine.
I'm having a cookout today.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.364
-Yeah dude, barbecue.
-The neighbors are totally fine.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.033
<i> Eight caliber bullet</i>

45:37.035 --> 45:39.001
<i> sliced off hill's steady</i>
<i> left thumb before--</i>

45:39.003 --> 45:40.970
-it's ok.
-I need you to calm.

45:40.972 --> 45:42.205
He was just--
he's just bringing food
to the cookout.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.407
Calm down.
Just calm down.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.375
Was he bringing this
to the cookout, too?

45:46.377 --> 45:48.144
He wasn't bringing
that to the cookout.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.278
Now that's
something interesting.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.913
I have a medical situation.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.081
I have anxiety.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.117
Where's your
medical card, sir?

45:54.119 --> 45:56.285
Uh, it's at my buddy,
Ryan's, place under his,
uh, tax documents.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.488
I'm not gonna tell you again.
I want you back behind that--

45:58.490 --> 46:01.057
- give me the phone.
- Mikey, chill out, dude.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.492
Is it-- it's legitimate?

46:02.494 --> 46:04.127
- It is legit, man.
- He has stuff on him.

46:04.129 --> 46:05.461
I know,
but he's got a prescription.

46:05.463 --> 46:06.963
Yeah, dude,
it's at Ryan's place.

46:06.965 --> 46:09.198
Crap, I'm full up
on my phone.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.433
Slow down.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.001
Do not put
this shit on YouTube.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.337
I got killer lettuce
from the farmer's market.

46:14.339 --> 46:16.806
It's off the chain, bro.
Put it on the burgers.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.841
Oh, dude, sorry,
did you get the lighter fluid,
by any chance?

46:18.843 --> 46:21.010
Dang, bro, I forgot.
I'm sorry, man.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.513
-Don't worry about it.
-Sorry.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.782
Is he gonna come out--
is he gonna be released today?

46:25.784 --> 46:27.884
- That's up to him.
- -See you downtown.

46:27.886 --> 46:30.119
Which downtown is it?
Downtown or like
rampart or Hollywood?

46:32.423 --> 46:34.824
Downtown,
like the expression? Or like--

46:34.826 --> 46:37.093
ok, it's probably downtown.

46:37.095 --> 46:38.828
I think he means downtown.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.965
I told you guys not
to climb over the fence.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.134
I told drew specifically on
the phone to not do that.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.069
Yeah, but we needed to get in

46:47.071 --> 46:50.873
because I had
to go to the bathroom.
I still have to go.

46:50.875 --> 46:52.475
What were you gonna do,
pee in the yard?

46:52.477 --> 46:53.509
-Yeah.
-There he goes.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.379
Bye, drew.

46:56.381 --> 46:58.347
-Yeah, bye drew.
-See you.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.149
I to-- Jesus Christ.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.184
Cops.

47:01.186 --> 47:02.885
Yeah, those were the same cops

47:02.887 --> 47:04.120
that busted me
for pissing earlier
and gave me that ticket.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.857
Aw, he got...

47:07.859 --> 47:10.193
That's all his leg blood
on the bag of groceries.

47:10.195 --> 47:11.828
I'm not touching that.
I'm a vegetarian.

47:11.830 --> 47:15.431
So blood... blood on
the food, no good.

47:15.433 --> 47:17.433
Well, I think that's
just a good rule of thumb
anyway

47:17.435 --> 47:20.503
with anything
with blood on it. I'm not--
i gotta check on my meat.

47:26.543 --> 47:28.444
- This meat's expired.
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

47:28.446 --> 47:30.479
But, like, I kept it
in the freezer
since I bought it,

47:30.481 --> 47:32.315
so, like, it should be cool.

47:32.317 --> 47:35.117
Yeah, but it's expired.
It's from may.

47:35.119 --> 47:36.452
I know the date is expired,

47:36.454 --> 47:41.224
but when I bought it,
it was still at the store

47:41.226 --> 47:43.059
and when I brought it home,

47:43.061 --> 47:45.061
I froze it
and it's been frozen
since then.

47:45.063 --> 47:46.529
You know
what I'm saying?

47:46.531 --> 47:48.297
I texted drew, but
he hasn't texted me back.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.565
- So it's been--
- because he's in jail.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.868
It's been frozen
since I bought it.

47:51.870 --> 47:53.536
So it should be cool to eat.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.404
Yeah, should be.

47:55.406 --> 47:57.974
Should be. That's why
I'm a vegetarian, though.

47:57.976 --> 48:00.343
But no.
See how it got thaw--

48:00.345 --> 48:02.478
I still thought
it'd be more thawed by now.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.347
My bad.

48:04.349 --> 48:06.182
Uh, but yeah I don't know,
once we have it, like,
on the grill,

48:06.184 --> 48:08.184
we just toss it on
the grill and it'll be cool.

48:08.186 --> 48:11.354
- Mark's still in the car.
- -Oh, yeah.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.022
<i> Near the confederate right,</i>

48:13.024 --> 48:14.323
<i> along a Ridge.</i>

48:14.325 --> 48:15.625
<i> Due to swampy grounds...</i>

48:30.274 --> 48:30.273
Hey!

48:34.177 --> 48:36.479
Man, I texted you
like five times.

48:36.481 --> 48:37.380
Sorry, man.

48:41.618 --> 48:42.518
Oh, shit.

48:46.290 --> 48:47.657
Hey, right here.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.567
Then I had the lighter fluid
and I left it in the uber car.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.403
Then when I got out of there,
i tried to take a piss...

49:08.679 --> 49:10.479
Who wants a veggie or meat?

49:10.481 --> 49:12.315
The veggie will probably
be done quicker.

49:12.317 --> 49:14.583
Make sure you
keep the veggie and
the meat separate.

49:14.585 --> 49:17.086
That meat
doesn't look very good.

49:17.088 --> 49:18.621
You know,
Gordon ramsay says that

49:18.623 --> 49:21.324
you should only cook it on
one side for ten minutes

49:21.326 --> 49:22.725
and flip one time.

49:22.727 --> 49:25.528
Don't he cook like
he's changing a baby?

49:25.530 --> 49:29.098
Once the fire
really gets going, it won't--

49:29.100 --> 49:31.000
it seems gross now,

49:31.002 --> 49:32.735
but, like, once it
gets going going,

49:32.737 --> 49:36.038
it'll be just like
normal burger meat.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.074
The veggie spatula
is right here.

49:43.213 --> 49:45.081
All right, cool.
All the ice is off.

49:47.751 --> 49:49.719
Hey, Mikey,
i got a little meat
on the veggie side,

49:49.721 --> 49:51.454
but only in one corner.

49:51.456 --> 49:53.689
That's ok.

49:53.691 --> 49:55.624
Like a big-ass
white castle burger.

50:02.032 --> 50:03.566
Looks like
my friend, gregg, is here.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.101
Can I get the keys
for the gate?

50:05.103 --> 50:06.335
Uh, here, I'll go get him.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.603
Can you just put on
a couple buns

50:07.605 --> 50:09.005
and some of those
veggie patties on a plate?

50:09.007 --> 50:10.039
Ok.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.116
Where'd these flies
come from?

50:20.118 --> 50:21.517
I don't know.

50:21.519 --> 50:22.785
They're not supposed to
have them in California.

50:22.787 --> 50:24.553
I know.

50:24.555 --> 50:25.454
Hey.

50:27.224 --> 50:29.058
What's up? How's it going?

50:29.060 --> 50:30.459
-Mark's buddy?
-Yeah. Gregg.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.128
What's up? Nice to meet you.

50:32.130 --> 50:33.195
Come on in.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.135
Ok, cool, it didn't burn.

50:39.137 --> 50:41.370
-Happy fourth, gregg.
-Happy fourth.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.439
-Good to see you.
-Do you actually have meat?

50:43.441 --> 50:45.708
Uh, yeah, yeah, that is meat.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.143
Do you have a bathroom?

50:47.145 --> 50:50.046
Uh, yeah. Actually,
see the front door?

50:50.048 --> 50:51.347
Just go through that and then

50:51.349 --> 50:53.282
you'll walk through
a living room.

50:53.284 --> 50:55.384
Ya know what? I'll
show him where it is.
I'll just show him.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.619
Yeah, just go in the back.

50:56.621 --> 50:58.187
But just make sure
when you go in and out,

50:58.189 --> 51:00.389
just make sure
you close the door

51:00.391 --> 51:02.558
because there's a cat inside
i can't let out.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.329
Do you want one of
the veggie patties?

51:07.331 --> 51:09.331
-They're almost done.
-I'm waiting on this.

51:12.636 --> 51:14.670
Veggie plate.
Other plate.

51:14.672 --> 51:17.206
Fucking specks
keep getting in my eyes.

51:17.208 --> 51:19.742
Your eyes are weak.
That's why.

51:19.744 --> 51:22.611
-No, the little ashy things.
-Yeah, I'm taking it.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.481
There you go.

51:25.483 --> 51:28.651
That dude
with the American flag tie,
he let the cat out.

51:28.653 --> 51:32.621
Fuck, all right. Uh, here.
That's the--
that's the veggie thing.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.626
That meat--
that's rare?

51:37.628 --> 51:39.528
Is there such a thing
as a rare veggie?

51:39.530 --> 51:42.465
Looks like a dick, right?
There's really one ball,

51:42.467 --> 51:44.700
but it really
does look like both.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.869
But if you were looking
from the side,
you would only see one ball.

51:46.871 --> 51:48.671
Did you guys see
a cat come out the door?

51:48.673 --> 51:50.573
Mikey said the cat got out.

51:50.575 --> 51:53.375
- There's cats?
- -Oh yeah, I saw a cat.

51:53.377 --> 51:54.844
Like, inside or outside?

51:56.179 --> 51:57.880
I was going inside.

51:57.882 --> 51:59.815
- And it went outside?
- -Yeah.

51:59.817 --> 52:02.184
Well, do you know
which one it was?

52:02.186 --> 52:04.120
-Might have been orange.
-Ok.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.155
Yeah, that's Steve Sanders.

52:06.157 --> 52:08.457
Scotty, can you help me
find this cat?

52:08.459 --> 52:10.526
-The cat got out?
-Yeah, Steve Sanders.

52:10.528 --> 52:12.428
-That's a dick.
-Yeah, do you see it?

52:12.430 --> 52:14.230
Steve Sanders?

52:14.232 --> 52:15.698
He's not gonna come
to his name. He's a cat.

52:15.700 --> 52:18.167
He sometimes does
or snap your fingers.

52:18.169 --> 52:19.902
How about if I, um, tell him
i don't like him?

52:19.904 --> 52:21.770
He'll probably come up
and sit in my lap.

52:21.772 --> 52:24.406
- Steve Sanders?

52:24.408 --> 52:26.675
Goddamn it.
Why'd he let him out?

52:26.677 --> 52:28.677
- Steve Sanders?
- -Cat.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.380
I thought I saw.

52:31.382 --> 52:32.715
There's a bunch of
neighborhood cats, too.

52:32.717 --> 52:33.849
Found a penny.

52:35.452 --> 52:36.552
Steve Sanders!

52:36.554 --> 52:37.820
Steve Sanders.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.822
Like, how does he know it's you?

52:39.824 --> 52:41.524
- Who? Steve Sanders?
-Yeah.

52:41.526 --> 52:43.259
I don't know,
he'd smell me or something.

52:43.261 --> 52:45.494
- Smells like him back here.
- -Steve Sanders.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.763
This is like
a horror movie back here.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.431
It's like a work in progress.

52:49.433 --> 52:50.833
Cat, cat, cat.

52:50.835 --> 52:53.235
He could probably be, like,
in any of these tubes.

52:53.237 --> 52:55.304
I thought I put
a sign on the door about it.

52:55.306 --> 52:56.605
What does he sound like?

52:56.607 --> 52:58.507
Like, you know,
he says meow and shit.

52:58.509 --> 52:59.575
Steve standers?

52:59.577 --> 53:00.743
This is broken, I assume.

53:02.512 --> 53:03.779
-Steve?
-Steven?

53:05.248 --> 53:07.249
This sucks.

53:07.251 --> 53:08.517
It's just a cat. They're fine.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.252
Takes a full six weeks
to go feral.

53:10.254 --> 53:12.621
- Shit. Hold up.

53:12.623 --> 53:13.923
That's Mia.

53:13.925 --> 53:15.291
Hello?

53:18.595 --> 53:19.628
Hey, what's up?

53:21.264 --> 53:22.965
So you got off early,
that's awesome.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.736
Oh.

53:27.738 --> 53:30.439
Wait,
how did you get there?
You didn't take your car today?

53:30.441 --> 53:31.640
Oh, fuck, that's right.

53:31.642 --> 53:32.908
No, I forgot you carpooled.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.277
I'm parked.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.779
No, no, it's not a big deal.
I can come pick you up.
It's not a problem.

53:36.781 --> 53:39.782
Sucks, you have
a prime parking spot
right out front.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.584
Yeah, I'm just parked
across the street.

53:42.786 --> 53:44.787
So, yeah.
No, no, I'll come.

53:44.789 --> 53:47.456
It's gonna take you forever
to find parking
near the house again.

53:47.458 --> 53:49.291
Yeah, no, a few people
are here right now.

53:49.293 --> 53:50.926
Check this out,
you can put it back
in the tree. You see this?

53:52.729 --> 53:53.662
-Thorns.
-Wow.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.965
Someone let the cat out.

53:55.967 --> 53:57.766
So... no, Scotty and i
are looking for it right now.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.501
You know what,
don't worry about it.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.537
It's not a big deal.
I'll come pick you up.

54:01.539 --> 54:03.505
It's totally cool.
All right, see you
in a little bit.

54:03.507 --> 54:05.241
I love you. All right.
Bye-bye.

54:06.977 --> 54:08.644
-Hey, did you know that limes--
-i gotta go pick up Mia.

54:08.646 --> 54:11.347
The dude that she drove with,

54:11.349 --> 54:13.515
like, basically her boss,
let her off early,

54:13.517 --> 54:14.883
if she can leave now.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.585
But if I don't go
get her right now,

54:16.587 --> 54:17.853
they're probably gonna
give her another shift

54:17.855 --> 54:19.688
just because of
the holiday traffic shit.

54:19.690 --> 54:20.823
Let's go.

54:20.825 --> 54:23.525
Cool. Uh...

54:23.527 --> 54:26.962
Yeah, um, actually I'll leave.
But I'll just-- fuck, Thorn.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.831
If you can just take care
of guests and shit.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.566
What if I find
the cat though?

54:30.568 --> 54:32.334
Well, if you find
the cat, put him inside.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.943
I don't know.
Just keep people company
until I get back

54:40.945 --> 54:42.544
and if anybody
needs to know
where the bathroom is,

54:42.546 --> 54:43.846
you know what I mean,
just tell them.

54:43.848 --> 54:46.515
-Ok.
-Oh, shit. Here, um...

54:46.517 --> 54:50.753
Take the key
to the house because...

54:50.755 --> 54:52.288
Where the fuck
is this thing?

54:52.290 --> 54:53.589
Just give me the keys.

54:53.591 --> 54:54.757
The gate
just needs to just stay shut.

54:54.759 --> 54:55.791
Just give me all of them.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.359
-I need the car key.
-Oh.

54:57.361 --> 54:58.827
You know what I'm saying?
Here's the key.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.462
- Um...
-No problem.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.530
Make sure--
make sure the gate stays shut.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.831
Yeah, no problem.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.300
Just so no randoms
come in or whatever.

55:04.302 --> 55:06.635
And, uh, just peek over the edge
and make sure...

55:06.637 --> 55:08.637
Just keep a look out
for guests or whatever.

55:10.308 --> 55:11.440
All right, whatever.
All right. See you in a bit.

55:32.762 --> 55:33.929
Hey, what's up?

55:33.931 --> 55:35.731
Can I get through real quick?

55:35.733 --> 55:38.767
I mean, we're kinda, like,
we're kinda set up.

55:38.769 --> 55:42.638
I-- I don't--
it's kinda like
a lightweight emergency.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.406
I mean, yeah, ok.

55:44.408 --> 55:47.409
- I mean, go ahead. It's what--
- all right, can I?

55:48.713 --> 55:51.680
Thanks a lot, man.
What the fuck, dude?

55:51.682 --> 55:53.916
--Go ahead.

55:53.918 --> 55:55.351
Jesus Christ.

56:06.796 --> 56:08.997
What the fuck is
wrong with people?

57:31.981 --> 57:36.785
Some old dude gave me
this enormous gummy bear

57:36.787 --> 57:38.620
as a tip.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.556
- Did he give you money also?
- -No.

57:40.558 --> 57:42.825
No. Just the gummy bear.

57:42.827 --> 57:46.695
Fucking weird, though,
that he's rolling around
with a big-ass gummy bear.

57:46.697 --> 57:50.199
And so I thought
I'd give it to you,
if you want it.

57:50.201 --> 57:52.067
I'd eat it.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.802
I've not actually gotten to
eat hardly anything today.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.804
I got to eat
a crumpled up snickers.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.073
I've not had
one burger yet or anything.

57:58.075 --> 58:00.042
Really?

58:00.044 --> 58:02.144
Yeah, because
everything just
keeps being fucking chaotic.

58:02.146 --> 58:04.680
Was there a lot of traffic?

58:04.682 --> 58:05.981
Uh, kind of.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.584
Some assholes threw
fireworks on my car.

58:08.586 --> 58:10.252
That's why
it smells like fart.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.920
Yeah, I smell it.

58:11.922 --> 58:14.256
--Oh, shit, can you
get that for me?

58:15.492 --> 58:16.825
I just got a text, I think.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.927
I don't want you
to, like, text and drive.

58:18.929 --> 58:21.029
I don't want you
to get a ticket.
It's gonna be expensive.

58:21.031 --> 58:24.166
Can you look at it for me
so I don't have to do that?

58:24.168 --> 58:26.735
All right.
It's from Jenny.

58:26.737 --> 58:30.205
She... "Can I swing by
and check on the cats?"

58:30.207 --> 58:32.074
Just text her that
i already fed the cats.

58:32.076 --> 58:34.710
I did already feed the cats.
So it's not even like...

58:34.712 --> 58:36.211
-Cats...
-I know she just wants to...

58:36.213 --> 58:37.746
Are...

58:37.748 --> 58:39.548
Fed... sent.

58:39.550 --> 58:41.049
I'm not being weird
about it, am I?

58:41.051 --> 58:43.151
Like, that's rude that
she's texting me

58:43.153 --> 58:46.522
about shit that
Derek wants done.

58:49.225 --> 58:51.260
It is pretty nicely wrapped.
Look at that.

58:54.264 --> 58:56.565
You need scissors
to open it
or does it just open?

58:56.567 --> 58:57.699
No.

58:57.701 --> 58:58.834
Oh, shit.

58:58.836 --> 59:01.036
That's pretty awesome actually.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.871
It smells like soap.

59:04.774 --> 59:05.941
Can I get a bite of it?

59:08.278 --> 59:10.612
Holy shit.

59:10.614 --> 59:12.247
Pull it.

59:12.249 --> 59:14.983
- Oh, god.
-I hit my fucking head.

59:14.985 --> 59:17.119
- Are you ok?
- -Yeah.

59:17.121 --> 59:18.954
-Oh, shit.
-The highway's moving.

59:18.956 --> 59:20.222
Oh, my god.

59:40.844 --> 59:43.612
Why is there
no goddamn parking
in my neighborhood?

59:43.614 --> 59:45.180
I hate when people
park their fucking car, like,

59:45.182 --> 59:48.717
and they leave, like, two-thirds
of a car length between them

59:48.719 --> 59:50.752
and the end of
a curb or a driveway.

59:50.754 --> 59:52.921
Pull to the fucking end.

59:52.923 --> 59:55.123
What are you gonna do?
Like a smart smart car's
gonna go there.

59:55.125 --> 59:56.959
That guy parked
right in the middle
of two spots.

59:56.961 --> 59:58.794
Yeah, stupid.
Fire hydrant.

59:58.796 --> 01:00:00.062
Nope, driveway.
Not a spot.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:01.797
Not a spot.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.732
You're gonna have
to drive slower,
i can hardly look.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.267
Goddamn it,
there's like nothing.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.835
That guy just parked.

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.136
You think we'll have
to park this far?

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.738
I should've peed
before I left work.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.807
That could easily be two spots
if he pulled forward.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:12.941
After 6 pm,
you can do the yellow.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:16.078
Jesus Christ, those
fucking dickheads.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.947
They're like saving a spot
for somebody.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.016
- Is this guy leaving?
- -Maybe.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.957
This is...

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.763
Seriously probably
the farthest I've had to park.

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:41.303
It's gonna take us, like,
20 minutes or so to get back.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:44.072
Like, we could watch an episode
of <i> friends</i> in the time.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:45.107
Sorry.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:49.945
Jesus Christ.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.115
Forgot the fuckin...

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.251
Forgot to lock the door.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.896
-Fucking kidding?
-What?

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.965
Jesus Christ.
How many--

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:11.400
it's Jenny, again.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:12.868
Honestly, how many times
are you gonna text?

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:14.870
Yes, I fed the fucking cats.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.372
You need
to get out of there.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:18.907
Did she not get?

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.375
You need to get out of there.

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:22.844
She needs to get out of there.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.012
There's no point
in living somewhere

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.781
where you don't feel at home.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.217
I feel at home.
She shouldn't.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.020
Problem is,
she feels too at home

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.889
and she doesn't even live there.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.834
Oh, shit.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:47.969
Man.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.238
Got crap all over it.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.174
Maybe you could wipe it off.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:03.385
Maybe we should leave a note.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.253
Doesn't look like
there's any damage.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.888
Just stuck a little bit.
It looks ok.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.224
Oh, sorry, man.

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.994
I was just trying to make
it land in the street

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.362
because I got dirt on it.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:15.897
It's a gummy bear
that I was eating.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:20.302
We'll totally pay for it.
We'll pay for the damages.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.806
I have some tip money
in my purse.

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:26.975
- Dude!
- -Is this your <i> carro?</i>

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.044
You need to chill out.

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:30.512
Dude, what are you doing?

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.314
What are you doing?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.515
This is not our car.

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:36.885
Dude, this is not our car.

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.286
--You're being so weird.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:41.022
This is not our car.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:46.962
Dude, you need
to chill the fuck out.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.330
I didn't mean
to hit your car.

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.434
Are you trying to hurt
the gummy bear or the car?

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.770
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:55.837
You need to get away
from my car.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:57.773
You just spit on me, big time.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.474
Dude, get away from my car.

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:03.044
Hush, ma'am.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.179
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.114
I have mace.
It's somewhere in here.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.249
Hey, sir.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.251
Stop, or I will shoot you
with mace.

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:11.319
I will shoot you
with mace.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.388
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.123
We're not involved
with this guy.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.992
Absolutely not.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:18.827
You hit my car
with a gum bear.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.829
Let's just get out of here.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.497
Well, it was my fault.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:24.199
I don't want the dude
to kill each other
over a gummy bear.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:25.567
Kill him? It's just mace.

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:27.402
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, no, no, no. Back to you!

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:29.404
You hit my car
with a gum bear.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:31.439
Is that what you do?
Is that how you live?

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.141
La, la, la, la, la, la.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.277
Hey! What're your names?

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:36.344
Let's just get out of here.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.546
- Sorry.
-What?

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:39.314
- Never mind. Sorry.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.482
What're your names?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:43.118
I'm a renter in
this neighborhood.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.452
Oh, don't walk away
holding hands.

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:47.422
Great.
Nice to meet you.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:49.958
Damn it. Happy fourth of July.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.997
Why is the gate open? Here.

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:14.583
Whoa. Hey.
Spread those big old legs.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.184
- What's up?
- -What's up, man?

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.353
Did you leave the gate open
or someone else do that?

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:21.356
Yeah. I don't want
to keep running down there
to unlock it.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.259
The reason I gave you
the keys is so randoms
don't come off the street.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.294
I mean, not to sound like
a dick or whatever,

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.163
but I'm just saying, like...
Do you see the dude?

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.531
I don't wanna
look at him too much,

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.266
but do you see the dude
on the steps or whatever?

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:32.601
Did you let him in or
is he a friend or something?

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:33.935
He just showed up,
i don't know.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:35.637
- Do you know him?
-Oh.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:38.039
Hey, little red riding hood.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.008
He doesn't look like
someone I would know.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.009
He's creeping everybody out.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:42.277
Yeah.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.512
I think you need
to ask him to leave.

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.982
You're gonna ask
a homeless guy to leave?

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.150
-That's kinda--
-no one said he's homeless.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:50.952
Just politely
ask him to leave.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:54.256
Ok, yeah.
I mean, I will.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:57.325
- Just give him a burger.
- -Yeah.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.361
I'm not giving him
a fucking burger.

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:01.229
He might be
a vegetarian.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.598
Yes, he might be.
Ok, all right.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.067
-This is fucking awkward.
-He's probably used to it.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.370
I don't think a homeless guy
can even be a vegetarian.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.111
Hey, you 18?

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:30.492
Are you buddies
with the owner?

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.660
No.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.364
You rolled in with a...

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.067
With a crew?

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.236
A crew? No.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:42.237
I don't know,
friends or whatever.

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.638
No.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.941
Just rolled in.
Just cruised up.

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.046
It sounds, uh...

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:53.415
I don't know. I don't wanna be
a dick or whatever, but um...

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.250
And this sounds dickish,

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.018
but it's kinda like
a private event.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.486
I mean, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.422
Uh-huh.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:03.291
But like, you're like
lightweight creeping out
some of the girls.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.427
-Huh?
-Not just the girls.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.295
I'm what?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.730
Don't act like
you don't know.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.466
Like, you keep talking to
the girls that go by,

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.235
like saying, like,
hollering at them or whatever.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:17.439
-It's cool.
-The thing is, it's not cool.

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:20.175
I mean, I don't know.
It really wouldn't matter,

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:23.311
but, like,
i know that you're making
people uncomfortable.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.147
You know, you're making me
uncomfortable right now.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.049
Well, then,
the feeling's mutual.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:31.619
Like, so, then,
maybe it's time to roll out.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:33.121
Go ahead.

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:35.056
I'm not gonna leave,
i live here.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:37.025
-Nice place.
-Thank you.

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:39.661
Check it out, you can just
take whatever beer you got
and just roll out.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:40.729
Like, you've already
made out ok.

01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:43.365
Do you want a burger?

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:44.599
You got a burger?

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.468
No, we're not gonna
give you a burger.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.169
Look, you already got,
like, three beers

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.504
and however many
you drank before I got here.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:50.672
Is she invited?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.240
Yes she was,
that's my girlfriend.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:54.009
How about that one?

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.777
The one over there
in the t-shirt.

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.113
Why is there no music?

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.147
Wait here.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.419
Oh, shit.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.590
Fuck.

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:17.032
This is fucking bullshit, dude.
Ok, like, give me the iPod.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.801
I don't have
your fucking iPod.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.803
I don't have
your fucking iPod, man.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:24.406
I've been through
bullshit today, dude.
Give me the fucking iPod.

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:26.608
What the fuck is that?

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.077
It's my fucking iPhone, man.

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:31.679
Is it ok for me
to have this here?
Is that all right with you?

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.648
I know everybody else
here is either a friend

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.283
or a friend of a friend.

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:36.484
You've already admitted
to being a fucking random.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.086
I'm not trying to be an ass.

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:40.088
Fuck being an asshole.
Fuck you. Give me the iPod.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.589
Fuck you.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:42.724
Just don't be an asshole.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.459
Just give me
the fucking iPad.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.727
What is it,
an iPod or iPad?

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:47.662
It's an iPod, my bad.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:48.797
I don't run
a fucking genius bar.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:51.299
Give me my iproduct.

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:52.367
Are you hard of hearing?

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.668
Would you like me
to sign it?

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:56.337
Do you-- do you have your--

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:57.705
<i> hill repeatedly requested</i>

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:59.441
<i> that Lee set up</i>
<i> a court of inquiry.</i>

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:01.443
<i> But the commanding general--</i>

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.445
do you have the iPod?
Where's the iPod that
was here for the party?

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:04.813
I have it right here.

01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:07.082
Jesus Christ.
There's a fucking--

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:09.417
fucking idiot.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.152
I don't know
what's with that guy.

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:12.520
He's been just strange.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.358
All right, my bad. Yes.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.361
I told you I didn't have
your fucking iPod.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.162
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.698
I'm here, I'm just
drinking a beer.
I'm chilling.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.201
You come here and say,
"oh man, you got
my fucking iPod."

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.136
I'm sorry about that.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.703
I don't fucking believe you.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:34.442
Ok.
Well, then, don't believe me.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.278
Take it for what it is.
I am sorry about
accusing you about that.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.247
But in general, though.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.149
In general?
What? Fuck you.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.484
In general,
this has already gotten--

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:43.818
wait, hold on.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.520
In general, this has
already gotten awkward.

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.188
I'm leaving.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.856
-I think it's time to leave.
-But not because of you.

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:50.358
Ok, great.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.327
What a bunch of
hipster douchebags.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.229
Jesus Christ.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.630
Not cool.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:59.267
Private party.
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.702
Oh, what the fuck?

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.837
Hey, do you want me
to go or not?

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.706
It's a fucking prison here.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.474
Attica! Attica!

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.676
Hang on. Hang on.
Chill out, dude. It locks.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:10.879
Jesus Christ,
you want me to go?

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.412
Yes, it locks from the inside.

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:13.515
What am I, under arrest?

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:14.916
No, I just gotta get
the key out.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.651
Do you have the keys?
I don't have my car keys.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.353
Come on, let's go.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.455
Oh, come on, man.

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:21.756
My country tis of thee.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.758
- Chill out, dude.
-You chill, man.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.160
Open the fucking door.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:27.228
-I am. Voila.
-Jesus Christ, man.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.831
Don't forget to recycle.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.299
Awesome, thank you very much.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.368
Douchebag.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:36.470
What's up?
My name is Patrick.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.841
What the fuck is this?
Jesus Christ.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.410
-What the fuck is this?
-That's my lighter fluid, dude.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:43.678
Oh, yeah, you say I stole
your lighter fluid now?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.546
You didn't steal it,
that dude did.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:47.649
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Get away from the car.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:48.883
I'm not an asshole. You're
the fucking dickweed, dude.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.218
You need gum or water?

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.889
Patrick.
Fuck you, dude.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.724
Fucking dickhead. Sucks.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:09:59.794
That was that fucking
dickhead, Patrick, driving.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:00.962
That uber dude
i was telling you about.

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:02.497
I know.

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:03.531
I don't think
that guy's homeless.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.799
Bullshit.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:06.868
Fucking Jenny's here.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.503
Hey.

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:11.406
Did you get my text?

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:14.242
-I already fed the cats.
-You're having a party?

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.644
It's more of
a get together.

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.746
Derek knows
you're having a party?

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.481
I'm having a get together.
I don't know why
it's a big deal.

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:23.484
So you can go tattle tale
or whatever
to fucking Derek.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:25.386
I'm gonna feed
the cats, ok?

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.721
I already fed the cats.
You don't need to
worry about that.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.356
Still don't need
your permission.

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:30.258
You kinda do! Technically
or whatever, like yeah.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.392
Technically,
wouldn't you pay rent?

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.694
I already have one
fucking freak.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:35.630
-Never mind.
-Oh, I'm sorry. Ok.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.232
Oh, wow.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.600
I will feed the cats.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:40.902
Thank you
for your permission.
It was amazing.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.375
I already fed the cat.

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:48.977
Feeding the cats, thanks.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.614
How many
cheeseburgers are left?

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:53.748
Well, not this one.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.252
Well, this is awesome.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.953
Yeah. Of course
there's no burgers left now.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:00.755
There's, like,
three-fourths of one.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.790
That's
all salmonellaed.

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:04.626
- I think that's a bun.
- Oh, it is just a bun.

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:07.028
Yeah, I got big-ass
fucking tray of meat

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.930
that I was, like,
so hyped to eat.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.532
Fucking bike is, like, fucking
fucked the fuck up.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:13.801
Your bike is destroyed.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.436
Your bike is
fucking destroyed.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.571
Just let me tell him
what happened.

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:18.506
I have no idea, it's...

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.375
Like, I don't know.
It's like a twizzler.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.743
Is that Derek?

01:11:21.745 --> 01:11:23.044
There's not a--
there's not even one wheel

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:25.046
that's not--
currently there anymore.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:26.514
Let me tell him what happened.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:28.049
I didn't fuck it up myself.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:30.752
-Steven is gone.
-The cat's coming back.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:33.388
Like, he's hid under
the house before.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:35.623
Some idiot at the party
let him out, I guess.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:36.824
Just let me talk to him.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:40.962
Derek wants
to talk to you.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.664
Ok, well, let me talk to him.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:45.433
-On your phone.
-Ok, whatever.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.402
Is he gonna call me?

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:48.803
Do you wanna call him?

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:51.306
He's in--

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:56.377
oh, he's calling you now?
Ok, I love you.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.480
Hello?
Hey, dude.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.850
No!

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.920
Look dude, I'm sorry
about the bike.
It's my bad, man.

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:07.855
Look, man, I'll pay for
the bike when
the check comes, man.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:10.391
Look, the cat will come back.

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:12.393
Normally he just hides
under the house, man.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.661
Hey, Derek,
tell him about
how you don't like him.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:14.796
Remember how
you're always talking about

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:15.997
how you don't like him?

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.799
You can't just
kick someone out, man.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.367
I paid for, like,
nine months of rent up until

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:21.402
when the fucking check
didn't come.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:23.871
That's like some
home owners rental law shit.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.440
You can't just
kick someone out.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.974
You need to give them, like,
60 days or something.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.643
I don't know.
I read some shit
about it on Facebook.

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.611
-Oh, my god.
-Look, dude, you can't--

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:31.746
yes, he can.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.748
This is
straight up bullshit, dude.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.516
It's, like, if you're kicking
a homeless man--

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.884
-you're a homeless man.
-I'm not a homeless man.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.090
Be quiet, dude.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:43.958
Look,

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.793
if this is gonna be as
extreme as kicking me out

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:46.961
it should be
as extreme as, like,

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.529
Jenny should have
to pay rent herself.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:49.897
She's here, like,
every fucking night.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.499
-Yeah, you should pay.
-I should fucking pay rent?

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:52.900
If I'm getting kicked out,
you should pay rent!

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.502
You don't even
fucking pay rent.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.571
You don't pay rent
and I'm gonna fucking pay?

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:59.440
You didn't let me give
keys to Mia, but you
let Jenny have keys.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:01.142
- This is bullshit, man.
- -Oh, my god!

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.010
You're homeless. You're
a fucking homeless dude.

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:04.812
Fuck you!
Fuck Jenny, dude.

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:06.147
You guys can eat
a fucking dick.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.616
You should be the one
who moves out.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:10.952
Oh, my god.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.491
Hello?

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.497
No, I was--
when did it cut out?

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.033
No. I was--

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.437
what I was saying was,

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:30.938
you're the one
being unreasonable

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.807
and, like, if you're gonna
kick me out, like,

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:35.910
-Jenny should pay rent.
-I'm not paying rent. What the--

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.713
you know what, man? Fuck it.
You win, dude.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:39.747
All right, I'll move out.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.524
Anyone wanna see
some cool shit?

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:52.160
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna blow up
these fireworks.

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.139
There's, like,
one more thing of tools.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.807
- This is kinda heavy.
- -Cool.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.685
Oh, shit, whoa, whoa, Steve.

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:51.686
Fuck.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:57.825
-Found the cat.
-Oh, cool. Is he ok?

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.660
Yeah, he looks ok.
He just looks dirty.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.930
Where have you been, dude?

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.566
Well.

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:09.904
Yeah, buddy, you get
to live here again.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:11.873
I don't.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:14.575
Thanks to a dickhead
that came to the party.

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:16.811
And thanks to Jenny.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:19.647
So make sure to go ahead
and piss on some of
Jenny's stuff for me.

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:23.918
Bye, apartment.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.586
I put him inside.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:27.955
There's still food out
so he should be fine.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.157
All right, here we go.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.138
Oh, shit.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.241
I think I got the check.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:48.843
Really?

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:51.078
Yeah, now that it's
fucking pointless.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:55.616
Well, I guess now
you can use it
for rent at my place.

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:58.152
- Let's see how much it is.

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.187
Goddamn it,
open the fuck up.

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:02.924
Fuck yeah.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:06.761
- Awesome.
- -Cool.

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.663
Better late than never.

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.967
It came just in time
to fuck up my whole life.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:13.968
So, that's awesome.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:22.310
Now, at least I won't
piss off your landlord.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.268
Did you remember
to leave the keys
in the mailbox

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.103
for Jenny and Derek?

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.072
No, I'll just
drop them off later.

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:52.306
Oh shit!
Look, look, look!

01:16:52.308 --> 01:16:54.275
Yep, that's the one.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.644
See the way
it's got the testicles?
That's the road rage guy.

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.679
Why would you put that
on your car?

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.181
I'm gonna get out and get
a photo of his license plate.

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:02.116
If you see him, just yell.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:16.263
Hurry up.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.872
You know what?
Fuck this, I got an idea.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.276
Can you just get in
the driver's seat real quick?

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:30.244
Just get ready to go.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.312
Yes.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:25.259
Charge!

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:38.005
You can't scratch
your nose, you're dead.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:41.041
-Sorry.
-You can't talk either.

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:43.010
You're making us
look like assholes.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.882
Oh, my god!

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:58.252
Ew, ew, ew!
Oh, my god. It is-- oh!

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.356
That is fucking--
oh, my god. Oh...
