15:56.781 --> 15:59.828
SOME POWDERED JELLY FISH.

15:59.871 --> 16:04.006
TRUST ME. IT'S BETTER
THAN MONTY'S ALGAE.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.268
SORRY.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.315
AHEM.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.057
YES, GABRIEL,
I'M TALKING TO THE PLANTS.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.189
MAKES THEM TASTE BET--

16:13.233 --> 16:16.671
I FOUND THESE.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.065
UH, PUMPKIN SEEDS.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.762
HOPE LIKES
PUMPKINS.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.072
UM...

16:28.117 --> 16:29.684
GO FOR IT.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.164
IS SHE HERE?

16:31.207 --> 16:32.817
SHE IS.

16:32.861 --> 16:36.343
PLANT THE SEEDS.
I'LL GO GET HER.

16:36.386 --> 16:37.866
RIGHT THERE'S FINE.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.804
HEY, HEY. NO.
IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.980
I'M NOT GONNA
HURT YOU. NO. WAIT.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.987
3 MONTHS PLAYING
HAPPY FAMILY TO
LURE HIM IN,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.380
AND YOU BLEW IT.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.295
SCREW THAT.
LOOK AT THE TOMATOES.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.601
HE'LL BE BACK.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.864
HE'S ON THE HOOK NOW.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.519
WE JUST NEED TO
REEL HIM IN.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.392
LET'S EAT LUNCH OUTSIDE
AGAIN SO HE CAN SEE US.

17:25.435 --> 17:28.134
BAIT ON THE HOOK.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.833
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.705
WE BAIT THE HOOK...

17:34.749 --> 17:38.187
-WITH YOU.
-HEH.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.625
OK. PAY ATTENTION. OK.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.761
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

17:48.719 --> 17:51.418
OK, BUT NOT TOO SMART.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.686
HEH HEH. SEE?
I WARNED YOU.

17:58.729 --> 18:02.472
HOPE: HELP!
SOMEBODY, HELP!

18:02.516 --> 18:04.909
HOPE!

18:04.953 --> 18:07.173
-HELP!
-HOLD ON! I'M COMING!

18:07.216 --> 18:09.218
HOPE: HELP ME!

18:21.187 --> 18:22.666
AGH!

18:22.710 --> 18:23.972
NO!

18:26.670 --> 18:28.803
HOLD ON. I GOT YOU.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.160
HOPE, ARE YOU OK?

18:38.204 --> 18:42.425
I AM NOW,
THANKS TO YOU.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.166
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.776
I WAS TRYING TO GET
TO BARDO TO SAVE
MY FAMILY.

18:45.820 --> 18:49.128
YOU CAN'T.
THE BRIDGE
IS TOO DEEP.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.522
HEY, HEY. WE'RE
YOUR FAMILY, TOO, OK?

18:52.566 --> 18:54.045
WE'LL GET THERE TOGETHER.

18:54.089 --> 18:57.353
WE'LL FIND AWAY.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.050
THE ONLY WAY
OFF THIS PLANET

18:59.094 --> 19:01.575
IS ON MY
ABSOLUTION DAY.

19:01.618 --> 19:05.318
4 YEARS, 10 MONTHS,
22 DAYS.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.102
IT'S YOUR
ABSOLUTION DAY MAYBE,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.452
BUT THEY'LL KILL US.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.106
HOPE, TOO.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.590
I WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.647
TH--THANK YOU.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.396
THE GARDEN WILL BE
PRODUCING SOON,

19:40.440 --> 19:43.443
BUT FOR NOW,
JELLYFISH EÉTTOUFFEE.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.053
GABRIEL: UHH.
ECHO: MMM.

19:45.096 --> 19:48.230
DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.
THEY LOVE IT.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.623
IT WAS MY MOTHER'S
SPECIALTY.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.408
YEAH. NAVY SEAL
TURNED TERRORIST CHEF.

19:52.452 --> 19:56.412
HATE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED
IF YOU SENT IT BACK.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.240
YOU OK?

19:58.284 --> 20:01.200
TERRORIST?

20:01.243 --> 20:05.247
-SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU.
-I WAS 10 WHEN THEY TOOK HER.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.945
SHE WAS A FREEDOM FIGHTER,
NOT A TERRORIST,

20:07.989 --> 20:10.252
BUT THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
AS FUNNY WITH CHEF, SO...

20:10.296 --> 20:12.167
IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.909
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY SHE WOULDN'T LET
AUNTY O TRAIN ME.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.520
SHE WAS SO ADAMANT.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.956
NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.655
SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE LIKE HER.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.353
WAIT TILL SHE SEES
YOU NOW.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.702
GUYS, WE'RE BEING RUDE.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.183
ORLANDO, TELL US
ABOUT YOU.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.751
WHAT ARE THESE?

20:30.794 --> 20:33.275
UH, IT'S, UM--

20:33.319 --> 20:35.973
12 SYMBOLS.
IT MEANS YOU'RE
A LEVEL-12, RIGHT?

20:38.367 --> 20:40.543
THE L-7 WHO ATONED
HERE BEFORE ME,

20:40.587 --> 20:43.024
HE TEACH YOU THAT?

20:43.067 --> 20:47.289
YES. DEV,

20:47.333 --> 20:49.944
AND HE TAUGHT ME
AS MUCH AS HE COULD,

20:49.987 --> 20:52.033
BUT WE WERE AFRAID
THAT I WOULDN'T
HAVE ANSWERS

20:52.076 --> 20:55.297
IF I WAS STOPPED
BY ANYONE HIGHER
ONCE WE WERE INSIDE.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.344
AND WAS HE RIGHT?
IS THAT WHY YOU FAILED?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.959
UH...NO.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.875
WE FAILED BECAUSE
I HESITATED

21:07.918 --> 21:09.311
WHEN IT WAS TIME
TO KILL.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.403
HE'S DEAD BECAUSE
OF ME.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.058
HIS BODY IS AT YOUR
SKELETON PICNIC.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.494
HEH.

21:22.019 --> 21:25.893
SO, UH, TELL US
ABOUT BARDO, ORLANDO.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.374
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT A THEORY

21:28.417 --> 21:30.463
ABOUT HOW YOUR PEOPLE
GOT THERE.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.161
-WOULD YOU LIKE TO, UH--
-THE SHEPHERD DELIVERED US.

21:33.204 --> 21:37.208
I'M SORRY ABOUT DEV.
I'LL BURY HIM WITH HONOR.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.819
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.171
THANK YOU.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.042
WAS THE SHEPHERD
ON ELIGIUS III, AS WELL?

21:45.086 --> 21:47.306
DON'T SAY HIS NAME.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.396
YOU STILL BELIEVE
ALL THAT STUFF

21:50.439 --> 21:53.094
EVEN AFTER THEY
LOCKED YOU UP?

21:53.137 --> 21:54.661
WHY DID
THEY LOCK YOU UP?

21:54.704 --> 21:56.271
SHEPHERD'S LAW
NUMBER 4--

21:56.315 --> 21:57.794
"HONOR THE DAY OF REST

21:57.838 --> 21:59.666
TO BE EFFICIENT
THE REST OF THE WEEK."

21:59.709 --> 22:04.105
I CHOSE NOT TO REST,
AND I WAS PUNISHED FOR IT,

22:04.148 --> 22:06.760
AND, YES,
I STILL BELIEVE.

22:11.155 --> 22:14.376
WAIT, ORLANDO,
STAY, PLEASE.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.726
NAH. THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.598
IT WAS--IT WAS LOVELY.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.127
ORLANDO.

22:26.170 --> 22:30.653
EHH. TOO BAD YOUR MOM,
THE NAVY SEAL,

22:30.697 --> 22:32.525
DIDN'T TEACH YOU
HOW TO SWIM.

22:34.483 --> 22:35.745
HEH.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.447
WELL, THAT COULD'VE
GONE BETTER.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.926
MM-HMM.

22:42.970 --> 22:46.190
LEVEL-12 IS
HARDCORE.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.496
IF WE CAN TURN HIM,
WE'LL HAVE ACCESS

22:47.540 --> 22:50.630
TO EVERYTHING
IN BARDO.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.762
WELL, THEN IT'S
A GOOD THING WE HAVE TIME

22:52.806 --> 22:54.373
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
NEED IT.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.553
YOU CAN TAKE IT APART
AND PUT IT TOGETHER AGAIN

23:00.596 --> 23:02.424
AFTER WE FIND OUT
WHAT IT CAN DO.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.514
RAVEN: AS OF NOW,
WE CAN'T EVEN
TURN IT ON.

23:05.558 --> 23:09.518
I DON'T EVEN SEE
A POWER SOURCE.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.955
I'VE READ THEORIES
ON HOW CERTAIN
MATERIALS CHARGED

23:11.999 --> 23:13.914
A CERTAIN
WAY CAN PRODUCE
AN INVISIBILITY FIELD,

23:13.957 --> 23:16.438
BUT THIS...

23:16.482 --> 23:19.267
THIS IS WAY BEYOND
WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.356
YOU THINK?

23:21.400 --> 23:25.665
YOU THINK.
THAT'S IT.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.627
IT WORKED!

23:31.671 --> 23:35.196
THOUGHT CONTROL.
COOL!

23:35.239 --> 23:39.853
SO BEYOND OUR CAPABILITIES
MEANS WHAT, ALIEN?

23:39.896 --> 23:42.116
WE'RE ALL ALIENS NOW.

23:42.159 --> 23:46.076
OH. ONE OF THE SYMBOLS
THAT WAS ON THAT GIRL'S
FACE IS IN HERE.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.253
I'M GONNA SELECT
THAT ONE.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.127
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:53.170 --> 23:55.303
NOTHING.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.957
SO WHAT DO YOU SEE?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.393
EVERYTHING.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.879
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.708
JORDAN, THERE'S
AN ANOMALY HERE, TOO.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.361
WHERE? HOW ABOUT
I GET A TURN?

24:10.405 --> 24:12.189
HOLD ON. WIDEN OUT
ONE STEP.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.936
HOW ARE THEY ALL
CONNECTED?

24:22.722 --> 24:25.551
-WORMHOLES.
-WHAT?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.596
-NO WAY.
-YES WAY!

24:27.640 --> 24:30.033
THE ANOMALY IS
A WORMHOLE,

24:30.077 --> 24:31.861
AND WHATEVER
THESE PEOPLE ARE,

24:31.905 --> 24:35.169
THEY CAN TRAVEL
ANYWHERE IN
THE UNIVERSE.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.737
OH. GUESS I'M OUT
OF A JOB.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.390
WHAT DO THEY WANT
WITH CLARKE?

24:42.568 --> 24:43.917
THEY KNOW THINGS.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.396
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

24:46.963 --> 24:49.618
"RENDITION"?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.360
CLARKE'S A TARGET.

24:52.403 --> 24:53.970
WE HAVE TO WARN
THEM.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.416
ECHO: ONE!
HOPE: DAMN IT!

25:05.460 --> 25:07.288
AH! EVERY TIME.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.724
-YOU'RE DEAD.
-I'M NOT DEAD.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.205
I'M INVISIBLE.
YOU'RE DEAD,

25:11.248 --> 25:12.641
AND THAT REALLY HURT.

25:12.685 --> 25:13.816
IS THIS A GAME
TO YOU?

25:13.860 --> 25:16.036
HOPE: EASY. HE'S BACK.

25:19.909 --> 25:22.782
AND GABRIEL'S RIGHT.
IF THEY GHOST, WE'RE DEAD.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.348
LET'S GO AGAIN.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.742
-ARE WE ENTERTAINING YOU?
-ECHO, CALM DOWN.

25:26.786 --> 25:30.311
ECHO: IF YOU GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY, SAY IT!

25:30.354 --> 25:33.270
OR MAYBE YOU'RE
GONNA RUN AWAY
AGAIN, HUH?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.970
HEY. HOLD ON.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.580
ECHO: L-12, HUH?

25:38.624 --> 25:41.104
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
SCARE ME?

25:41.148 --> 25:44.847
IF IT DOESN'T, IT'S
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.893
NOW I'M
REALLY SCARED.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.590
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IF I LOSE,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.287
YOU GET
THE CABIN BACK.

25:50.331 --> 25:53.900
IF YOU LOSE,
YOU HELP US TRAIN.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.205
TELL US WHAT WE
NEED TO KNOW.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.685
NEED TO KNOW
TO KILL MY PEOPLE?

25:56.729 --> 25:59.166
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
ANYWAY.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.298
THE ONLY QUESTION IS
ARE YOU GONNA DIE

26:01.342 --> 26:04.214
WITH THEM
WHEN THEY COME?

26:12.005 --> 26:16.662
HOPE: HA! AUNTY O WOULD
HAVE LOVED SEEING YOU GET
YOUR ASS KICKED. HA HA!

26:25.975 --> 26:28.630
ECHO: CAREFUL.
THAT STUFF'S DANGEROUS.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.893
TELL ME ABOUT M-CAP AGAIN.

26:32.939 --> 26:36.507
MEMORY CAPTURE.

26:36.551 --> 26:39.510
IT'S NOT TORTURE
UNLESS YOU FIGHT IT.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.124
AUNTY O DID,

26:44.167 --> 26:48.041
AND APPARENTLY,
SO DID MY MOM.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.698
BELLAMY WILL, TOO.

26:55.831 --> 26:59.574
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'LL DO IF I LOSE HIM.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.055
YOU WON'T.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.447
A YEAR HERE FOR US
HAS ONLY BEEN

27:03.491 --> 27:04.884
A FEW DAYS FOR HIM.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.672
WELL, FROM NOW ON,
YOU WANT TO BET SOMETHING--

27:10.716 --> 27:15.372
OHH--YOU LEAVE MY BED
OUT OF IT.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.853
HOPE: GOOD NIGHT,
ECHO.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.290
-GOOD NIGHT, GABRIEL.
-YEP.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.560
GOOD NIGHT, ORLANDO!

27:40.789 --> 27:42.443
ORLANDO: IN THE SHADOW
OF THE SHEPHERD.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.140
FOR ALL MANKIND,

27:44.184 --> 27:46.708
HE SAVED US FROM THE FIRE
THAT CONSUMED THE EARTH.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.015
IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEP--

27:49.058 --> 27:50.886
SORRY TO
INTERRUPT.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.802
JUST, UM--JUST WANTED
TO GIVE YOU THESE.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.285
-WHY?
-YOUR SKIN TONE'S OFF.

27:58.328 --> 27:59.982
I'VE NOTICED
YOU LOST WEIGHT.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.289
FAIRLY CERTAIN
YOUR BODY'S
IN KETOSIS.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.030
TRUST ME.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.727
EAT YOUR GREENS.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.382
-YOU A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING?
-I AM,

28:08.425 --> 28:09.775
SO TAKE THE ADVICE.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.646
HOPE: DAMN IT!
ECHO: DON'T POUT.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.082
I SHOULD GO.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.519
ECHO'S FIRING
LIVE ROUNDS AGAIN.

28:15.563 --> 28:18.305
YOU WON'T PULL IT OFF.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.307
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME WITH DEV,

28:20.350 --> 28:22.526
THEY'LL SEND MORE PEOPLE.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.267
THEY?

28:24.311 --> 28:26.182
WE.

28:26.226 --> 28:30.621
NO, NO. I SEE.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.101
WELL, WE HAVE
MORE PEOPLE, SO--

28:32.145 --> 28:33.624
NOT ENOUGH.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.671
SO HELP US.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.238
THANKS FOR THE VEGGIES.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.196
WE DON'T WANT TO KILL
YOUR PEOPLE, OK?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.764
WE JUST--WE JUST
WANT TO SAVE OURS.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.505
WOULD THE SHEPHERD
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT?

28:44.548 --> 28:46.463
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
SAY HIS NAME.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.858
SORRY. OK. IT'S JUST

28:49.902 --> 28:52.513
I KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT WORSHIPING
FALSE GODS.

28:52.556 --> 28:53.906
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

28:53.949 --> 28:56.125
I MEAN NO OFFENSE.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.824
LOOK. WE ALL COME
FROM EARTH, OK?

28:58.867 --> 29:01.217
A SHIP BROUGHT US
ACROSS THE STARS

29:01.261 --> 29:03.176
TO ESCAPE
A WORLD ON FIRE

29:03.219 --> 29:05.091
LARGELY THANKS TO
PEOPLE BASTARDIZING

29:05.134 --> 29:07.702
THE WORDS
OF THEIR GODS.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.617
WOULD THE SHEPHERD
THAT SAVED YOU CONDONE

29:09.660 --> 29:13.099
TORTURING MY FRIENDS,
WHO DID NOTHING TO YOU.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.753
WOULD HE CONDONE
SENDING A MAN

29:14.796 --> 29:17.364
AS DEVOTED TO HIM
AS YOU TO PRISON?

29:17.407 --> 29:21.672
NO. NO. MEN
CONDONE THOSE THINGS.

29:21.716 --> 29:25.372
WEAK MEN FOLLOW
THEIR ORDERS.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.026
ENJOY YOUR SALAD.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.551
ECHO: DON'T GIVE UP.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.600
66, 67.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.602
STILL NOT FAST ENOUGH.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.952
ORLANDO: WE DON'T
KILL ANYONE,

29:39.995 --> 29:43.999
YOU GET YOUR PEOPLE,
AND YOU GET OUT.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.741
BEST EFFORTS.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.613
YOU'RE A SOLDIER.
YOU KNOW THAT
IN BATTLE THINGS CAN--

29:49.657 --> 29:51.006
DONE.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.096
I'VE GOT 4 YEARS,
8 MONTHS,

29:54.140 --> 29:57.317
AND 17 DAYS TO TURN
YOU INTO DISCIPLES.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.406
IF YOU SURVIVE,

29:59.449 --> 30:02.626
YOU MAY BE READY.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.934
GET SOME REST.
WE START AT DAWN.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.215
ORLANDO: CONGRATULATIONS
ON REACHING LEVEL-12.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.661
HEY. DEV WOULD
BE PROUD OF YOU.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.272
I KNOW I AM.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.971
THAT GOES FOR BOTH
OF YOU, TOO.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.756
I WISH ALL MY
TRAINEES WERE AS
DETERMINED AS YOU.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.847
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
WOULD BE A LOT EASIER.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.981
WHO'S NEXT?

30:54.504 --> 30:57.638
YOU GO. I'M EATING.

30:57.681 --> 30:58.857
YOU'RE
ALWAYS EATING.

31:03.383 --> 31:07.387
I CAN NEVER EAT
THE NIGHT BEFORE BATTLE.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.997
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.481
IT MUST BE HARD
TO DEDICATE YOUR WHOLE LIFE

31:14.524 --> 31:16.570
TO SOMETHING THAT
MAY NEVER COME.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.919
NOT REALLY.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.095
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ELSE

31:20.139 --> 31:21.880
UNTIL I MET
ALL OF YOU.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.886
ONCE IT'S DONE
AND WE'RE OUT OF YOUR HAIR,

31:27.929 --> 31:31.454
WHAT RE YOU
GONNA DO?

31:31.498 --> 31:35.371
HE'S GONNA MISS US.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.504
OF COURSE I AM.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.332
SO COME WITH US.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.638
WHERE? SANCTUM?
RED SUN TOXIN,

31:41.682 --> 31:44.337
IMMORTAL BODY-SNATCHERS?

31:44.380 --> 31:47.688
THANKS, BUT I'LL STICK
WITH HONOR AND DUTY.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.603
GABRIEL: HEH HEH.

31:49.646 --> 31:52.040
NOW STOP TALKING,

31:52.084 --> 31:53.737
OR I WON'T JUST TAKE
THE BEATING

31:53.781 --> 31:55.522
I'M ABOUT LET
YOU GIVE ME.

32:12.191 --> 32:15.498
MASTER ORLANDO,
TIME FOR YOUR ABSOLUTION.

32:15.542 --> 32:18.632
QUIET. KNOWING ORLANDO,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
AT THE BRIDGE.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.329
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.463
WOMAN: NO.
IT'S A TRAP!

32:23.506 --> 32:25.030
GHOST MODE NOW!

32:27.554 --> 32:28.947
GABRIEL: NICE SHOT.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.079
BRIDGE CLOSES
IN 5 MINUTES. MOVE, MOVE!

32:34.082 --> 32:36.650
GET THE ARMOR OFF
AND SECURE THEM
BEFORE THEY WAKE UP.

32:39.827 --> 32:43.004
HOPE: NOT AGAIN.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.484
NO!

32:52.144 --> 32:54.015
THANK YOU.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.104
-SUIT UP.
-OK.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.498
-HOW MUCH TIME?
-4 MINUTES, 10 SECONDS.

33:05.374 --> 33:09.726
SHE HAD NO CHOICE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.467
NO, NO.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.037
GABRIEL:
ORLANDO, WE'RE SORRY.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.778
WE'LL SUIT UP,
THEN CUT YOU LOOSE.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.044
2.5 MINUTES TO SPARE.
IT'S TIME TO GO.

33:23.088 --> 33:28.528
NO. HE KNEW THAT GIRL,
TRAINED HER I'M GUESSING.

33:28.571 --> 33:32.532
HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
WILL HE KNOW
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.319
I HAVE TO SAVE BELLAMY.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.629
GABRIEL: ECHO.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.501
NO!

33:45.545 --> 33:47.155
ECHO, WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

33:47.199 --> 33:49.462
-THIS ISN'T THE PLAN.
-PLANS CHANGE.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.333
IF WE LEAVE THEM ALIVE,
HE'LL TELL THEM

33:51.377 --> 33:55.555
EVERYTHING, AND THEY'LL
COME AFTER US.

33:55.598 --> 33:56.904
HOPE: WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.297
-WE HAVE TO GO.
-NO!

33:58.340 --> 33:59.776
GABRIEL: ECHO!

34:01.691 --> 34:04.129
HE'LL BE WITH US,
ACTING LIKE OUR HOSTAGE,

34:04.172 --> 34:05.782
LEADING US
THROUGH THE COMPOUND.

34:05.826 --> 34:09.438
-THAT'S THE PLAN!
-NO, HE WON'T!

34:09.482 --> 34:12.398
WE'RE LEAVING HIM HERE?

34:12.441 --> 34:14.052
NO. NO WAY.
HE'S OUR FRIEND!

34:14.095 --> 34:16.837
YES!

34:16.880 --> 34:19.709
BUT WE ARE NOT
HIS PEOPLE.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.932
GRAB YOUR HELMETS.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.586
GABRIEL:
ECHO, THIS IS WRONG.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.244
YOU WANT TO STAY,
OR DO YOU WANT THE ANSWERS

34:32.287 --> 34:34.898
THAT ARE WAITING FOR YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

34:41.079 --> 34:43.037
GABRIEL: ECHO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

34:45.387 --> 34:47.650
ECHO:
CUT YOURSELF FREE.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.348
I AM SORRY.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.527
HE'LL BE ALONE
FOR YEARS.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.835
THE BRIDGE IS
CLOSING.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.828
NICE FENCE. NOT SURE
GABRIEL WOULD APPROVE,

35:34.871 --> 35:37.396
BUT I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE PLACE.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.180
-WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS?
-IN THE WOODS WATCHING

35:39.224 --> 35:42.618
YOUR BACK, NO DOUBT.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.054
GOOD GUESS.

35:44.098 --> 35:47.145
NOT THOSE FRIENDS.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.713
THEY WERE ON PENANCE.
THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.628
-PENANCE?
-PENAL PLANET.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.544
I TOLD YOU TIME MOVES
MUCH FASTER THERE.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.112
THEY MANAGED TO KILL
5 MORE OF MY PEOPLE.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.637
WE FOUND THE GRAVES
ALONG WITH THE BODY
OF A DISCIPLE PRISONER,

36:01.681 --> 36:03.857
WHO APPARENTLY SPENT
5 YEARS WITH THEM.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.252
HE KILLED HIMSELF
AFTER THEY BETRAYED HIM.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.863
-YOU'RE LYING.
-THEN HE IS, TOO.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.735
SUICIDE NOTE.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.172
TOSS IT.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.787
I'VE BEEN CIVIL
WITH YOU

36:20.830 --> 36:25.095
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT AT LAST COUNT

36:25.139 --> 36:28.708
9 OF MY PEOPLE
ARE DEAD.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.279
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT
MAKE IT 10.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.455
ON THIS WE AGREE.

36:41.373 --> 36:44.680
CLARKE: GOOD TRICK.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.595
TRUST ME.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.555
THESE THINGS ONLY WORK
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO
PULL THE TRIGGER.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.296
SINCE YOU ALREADY SAID
YOU NEED ME,

36:51.339 --> 36:53.211
GIVE ME THE DAMN NOTE.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.565
IT SEEMS OUR INTEL
ON YOU IS CORRECT.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.784
YOU'RE SMART, BRAVE,

37:01.828 --> 37:03.612
WILLING TO RISK
YOUR OWN LIFE.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.397
TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT
WILLING TO RISK
THE LIVES

37:05.440 --> 37:07.050
OF YOUR FRIENDS.

37:07.094 --> 37:10.184
ONCE SHE SHOOTS ME,
KILL HER FRIENDS.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.711
NOW YOU CAN ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS VOLUNTARILY,

37:15.755 --> 37:18.279
OR YOU CAN WAKE UP
CONNECTED TO A MACHINE

37:18.323 --> 37:21.804
THAT WILL EXTRACT
EVERYTHING WE NEED
TO KNOW.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.545
EITHER WAY,

37:23.589 --> 37:26.418
YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE
THE SHEPHERD.

37:26.461 --> 37:29.116
JORDAN: GOOD.
I'M IN TIME.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.249
CLARKE: JORDAN?

37:31.292 --> 37:32.772
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:32.815 --> 37:35.644
SAVING YOU. YOU CAN THANK
ME AFTER YOU

37:35.688 --> 37:37.037
GET DOWN!

37:48.178 --> 37:50.311
MILLER: RAVEN REYES,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.704
EVERYBODY, EYES
ON THE WOODS.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.227
THERE MAY BE MORE
OF THEM.

37:57.013 --> 38:02.149
JORDAN: HEY. IT'S OK.
YOU DID IT.

38:02.192 --> 38:05.457
I JUST KILLED 8 PEOPLE.
NOTHING ABOUT THAT IS OK.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.026
RAVEN: NOW LET'S GO
FIND THAT WORMHOLE

38:10.070 --> 38:11.506
AND BRING OUR FRIENDS HOME.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.345
NIYLAH: WHERE DOES
IT LEAD?

38:24.389 --> 38:26.391
EVERYWHERE.

38:26.434 --> 38:29.002
WE NEED TO GO
TO PENANCE AND FIND
THEIR TRAIL.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.220
HOW DO WE GET THERE?

38:30.264 --> 38:31.657
WE USE THE MAP.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.444
SHOW ME PENANCE.

38:38.054 --> 38:40.492
IT'S NOT RESPONDING.
IT--

38:40.535 --> 38:43.625
THE MAP DOESN'T USE NAMES,
ONLY SYMBOLS.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.845
OK. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
6 PLANETS

38:45.888 --> 38:47.499
IN WHAT COULD BE
A NETWORK.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.327
ONE SEEMS TO BE OFFLINE,

38:49.370 --> 38:51.285
AND ONE IS SANCTUM.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.331
-TWO STARS?
-YEAH.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.158
SO THAT GIVES US
A 1 IN 4 CHANCE.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.335
THAT'S IF ONE
OF THEM IS PENANCE.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.728
WE TRY THEM ALL.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.688
PICK ONE
AND ENTER THE CODE.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.211
OK.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.344
THIS ONE LOOKS FUN.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.043
IT'S SHOWING ME
WHAT SYMBOLS TO TOUCH.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.702
WHAT IF THE FUN ONE
ISN'T SURVIVABLE?

39:19.182 --> 39:21.228
NO ONE HAS TO DO THIS.

39:21.271 --> 39:23.839
YOU SHOULD EACH DECIDE
FOR YOURSELVES,

39:23.883 --> 39:25.972
BUT I'M NOT LOSING
ANYONE ELSE.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.191
MILLER: WELL,
IN THAT CASE, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

39:28.235 --> 39:29.671
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THE DEAD DISCIPLES
UP THERE DON'T CHECK IN.

39:29.715 --> 39:32.805
THEY'LL SEND MORE.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.547
I'LL STAY TO WARN
THE OTHERS AND PROTECT MADI.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.899
RAVEN: BOOM.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.687
WHO WANTS TO GO
FOR A RIDE?

39:50.736 --> 39:51.954
WHY NOT?

39:54.304 --> 39:56.481
I'M IN.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.048
WHAT THE HELL?
THIS PLANET
SUCKS ANYWAY.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.444
THANK YOU.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.841
BRING THEM HOME.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.582
WE'LL BE WAITING.

40:25.466 --> 40:29.818
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
CLARKE GRIFFIN HAS
LEFT THE PLANET.

40:58.238 --> 41:01.241
HUH! UNH!

41:08.117 --> 41:09.858
AAH! UNH!

41:22.131 --> 41:24.046
IS EVERYONE OK?

41:26.571 --> 41:29.356
YOU LIKE THIS PLANET
BETTER, MILLER?

41:29.399 --> 41:31.314
I SAY WE TRY
THE NEXT ONE.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.015
YEAH. ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

41:36.058 --> 41:38.147
WE NEED AN ANOMALY STONE
FOR THAT.
