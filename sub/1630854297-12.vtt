WEBVTT

00:08.482 --> 00:10.620
Why are we
backing up a 10-21?

00:10.724 --> 00:11.931
You remember that
construction site burglary

00:12.034 --> 00:13.655
that we responded to
a few weeks back?

00:13.758 --> 00:15.206
Two doesn't
make a pattern.

00:15.310 --> 00:16.206
The third time's
the charm.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.758
All in David Sector

00:17.862 --> 00:19.172
and all
targeting the same

00:19.275 --> 00:21.551
real estate developer--
Craig Stutz.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.137
Fun and games, right, huh?

00:23.241 --> 00:24.206
I'm gonna wipe
that stupid smirk

00:24.310 --> 00:25.206
off your face.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.206
You think stealing's

00:26.310 --> 00:27.344
a joke, buddy?

00:27.448 --> 00:28.344
This is a
family-run business.

00:28.448 --> 00:29.620
- Back up.
- Back him up.

00:29.724 --> 00:30.862
What's going on here?

00:30.965 --> 00:32.896
This is Craig Stutz,
he owns the place.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.448
This little ingrate
stole from my site.

00:34.551 --> 00:35.655
I didn't steal jack.

00:35.758 --> 00:37.172
I told you, it was the cops.

00:37.275 --> 00:39.103
All right, be quiet.
I need more story, and fast.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.551
Yeah, after you people did
nothing the last two times,

00:41.655 --> 00:43.551
I hired Marcus here as security.

00:43.655 --> 00:44.724
Who called in
to alert us

00:44.827 --> 00:46.793
of the robbery at 0615 hours.

00:46.896 --> 00:48.241
After it happened.

00:48.344 --> 00:49.448
Oh, my God.

00:49.551 --> 00:50.689
He let the guy
waltz right in,

00:50.793 --> 00:52.172
and I have iton tape.

00:52.275 --> 00:53.448
What aren't you
understanding here?

00:53.551 --> 00:55.965
The guy who did this
was one of them.

00:56.068 --> 00:57.517
He was NYPD?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.379
Flashed his badge at me
and everything.

01:07.344 --> 01:08.793
Thank you.

01:11.344 --> 01:13.862
Danny Reagan.

01:13.965 --> 01:15.827
My oldest and bestest.

01:15.931 --> 01:16.862
Mickey Patrick?

01:16.965 --> 01:17.862
The hell you doing

01:17.965 --> 01:19.413
showing your face
around here?

01:19.517 --> 01:20.931
Turns out you cannot take
the boy out of Brooklyn.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.310
I'm back, baby.

01:22.413 --> 01:23.758
Brooklyn's finest,
back where he belongs.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.793
You do realize
this isn't exactly

01:25.896 --> 01:27.965
how witness protection works,
right?
Yeah, no,

01:28.068 --> 01:29.379
I know, but Danny, get this.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.310
The whole Vasquez clan,

01:31.413 --> 01:33.344
behind bars. All of them.

01:33.448 --> 01:34.517
And so here I am.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.655
Been all good
since August.

01:35.758 --> 01:37.103
Ah. Six months you been back?

01:37.206 --> 01:39.034
I should have called earlier.
Some friend, huh?

01:39.137 --> 01:40.344
It's fine.
It's water under the bridge.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.620
I'm just glad
to see you.

01:41.724 --> 01:43.448
It's good to see you, man.

01:43.551 --> 01:44.862
Good to see you, too.
What are the odds?

01:44.965 --> 01:46.344
- Pretty good, actually.
- Yeah, I figured.

01:46.448 --> 01:47.620
What the hell's going on?

01:47.724 --> 01:49.793
Danny, uh,

01:49.896 --> 01:52.482
you got a minute,
talk something through?

01:52.586 --> 01:55.758
Yeah, let's
- get out of sight.
- Okay.

01:55.862 --> 01:57.551
Look at this.

01:58.965 --> 02:01.137
This is Alona.

02:01.241 --> 02:03.034
We're engaged to be married.

02:03.137 --> 02:05.482
Wow. She's beautiful. Congrats.

02:05.586 --> 02:07.379
Yeah. The thing is,

02:07.482 --> 02:10.000
I haven't heard from her
in almost three days.

02:10.103 --> 02:11.655
Same problem,
different woman, huh?

02:11.758 --> 02:13.655
Danny, I'm
- being serious.
- So am I.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.620
No, it's not like...
Look, so we-we fought

02:15.724 --> 02:17.379
a little bit,
but, no, this is...

02:17.482 --> 02:18.793
this is completely
unlike her.

02:18.896 --> 02:20.482
I'm starting to worry
something's seriously wrong.

02:20.586 --> 02:22.241
Okay, so why don't you
call your local precinct?

02:22.344 --> 02:24.241
Here's the rub.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.896
We-we kind of met
through a service.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.413
Mm-hmm.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.793
Eastern European war refugee.
She gets a green card,

02:31.896 --> 02:33.620
you get $30,000.
Something like that?

02:35.034 --> 02:36.379
$20K.

02:36.482 --> 02:39.172
You never were much
of a negotiator.

02:39.275 --> 02:40.241
I would report
her missing,

02:40.344 --> 02:41.896
but what if she
got arrested?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.724
What if she
- got deported?
- Well, our cops

02:43.827 --> 02:45.344
are not permitted to contact
ICE, so it's not a problem.

02:45.448 --> 02:46.689
I can't take that risk,
though, Danny.

02:46.793 --> 02:47.793
- I can't risk losing her.
- Well, I can't take

02:47.896 --> 02:50.000
the risk
of getting involved here.

02:52.827 --> 02:55.034
Look, brother,

02:55.137 --> 02:56.965
I know how this looks.
It's like,

02:57.068 --> 02:59.068
same old Mickey
doing the same old crap.

02:59.172 --> 03:00.586
This is different. I mean, sure,
it started like you said,

03:00.689 --> 03:02.896
but when
she came over,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
we fell for each other.

03:05.103 --> 03:08.310
We fell for each other,
completely, totally,

03:08.413 --> 03:10.896
and now I do not know
what to do.

03:15.275 --> 03:17.000
4:00.

03:17.103 --> 03:18.103
What's that?

03:18.206 --> 03:20.655
That's when my tour ends.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.379
I'll pick you up.

03:23.482 --> 03:25.310
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.413
I haven't done a damn thing yet.

03:29.862 --> 03:32.103
And last stop
on the grand tour,

03:32.206 --> 03:33.482
the muster room.

03:33.586 --> 03:34.551
Actually, the boss would
like to take a visit

03:34.655 --> 03:36.034
to the detective squad first.

03:36.137 --> 03:38.655
Officer.

03:38.758 --> 03:39.931
I'm sorry.

03:40.034 --> 03:41.103
Boss.

03:41.206 --> 03:42.275
Ma'am, are you all right?

03:42.379 --> 03:44.034
Uh...

03:50.068 --> 03:51.965
I...

03:53.103 --> 03:55.689
I just killed my husband.

04:28.689 --> 04:30.379
Ho ho ho.

04:31.655 --> 04:32.620
Well, it's a little
late for Christmas,

04:32.724 --> 04:34.137
don't you think, Santa?

04:34.241 --> 04:35.413
It's been bumper-
to-bumper traffic

04:35.517 --> 04:37.931
on the BQE since
mid-December, so...

04:38.965 --> 04:40.034
Better late than never,
though, right?

04:40.137 --> 04:42.448
Seriously, what
is this all about?

04:42.551 --> 04:44.068
I don't like goodbyes,

04:44.172 --> 04:46.689
so when
one's coming,

04:46.793 --> 04:49.206
I make myself celebrate it
instead of getting all mopey.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.344
Goodbye? I'm not going anywhere.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.931
Your campaign announcement
is just around the corner,

04:54.034 --> 04:56.724
and when that happens,
you are out of here.

04:56.827 --> 05:00.137
Well, I might be out of here,
but never out of your life.

05:00.241 --> 05:01.275
That's what
Shmerin Shreagan said,

05:01.379 --> 05:02.862
the A.D.A. who used to work

05:02.965 --> 05:04.586
in this office.

05:04.689 --> 05:06.172
Come on, open.

05:06.275 --> 05:08.000
Pizza.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.517
Chips?

05:12.620 --> 05:14.620
We're gonna sit on
a surveillance together.

05:14.724 --> 05:16.310
My parting gift to you.

05:16.413 --> 05:19.551
Your parting gift
is sitting on surveillance?

05:19.655 --> 05:21.172
On the Tully Richards case.

05:21.275 --> 05:23.724
We are this close, and you
ain't walking out that door

05:23.827 --> 05:25.896
till we nail him to the wall.

05:28.551 --> 05:30.896
There's a difference
between working with a crook

05:31.000 --> 05:33.068
and refusing
to get in their way.

05:33.172 --> 05:34.586
Then, what took you so long
to call this in?

05:34.689 --> 05:35.862
Self-preservation.

05:35.965 --> 05:37.000
Or acting in concert?

05:38.517 --> 05:40.413
Hey, boss.

05:41.724 --> 05:44.482
Stuart Eiseman,
Mr. Powers' attorney.

05:44.586 --> 05:46.517
And the cavalry arrives.

05:47.689 --> 05:49.068
That's your perp.

05:49.172 --> 05:50.482
Our investigators
pulled that off

05:50.586 --> 05:52.206
a doorbell cam two blocks
north of the scene.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.000
- We were getting there.
- Of course you were.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.482
Is my client
under arrest?

05:58.275 --> 05:59.689
No.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.206
Mazel. Marcus,

06:01.310 --> 06:02.827
let's go.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.655
None of Alona's other roommates
have heard from her either?

06:10.758 --> 06:12.275
Not a single one.

06:12.379 --> 06:14.793
And all of her belongings
are just as she left them.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.620
Come on, no one's
heard from here?

06:16.724 --> 06:18.068
Okay, all right.

06:18.172 --> 06:20.034
Step back and
- let me do my job.
- All right.

06:21.241 --> 06:22.517
A lot of people
stay here?

06:22.620 --> 06:24.137
Six girls.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.482
Six girls?

06:25.586 --> 06:26.724
Packed in, huh?

06:26.827 --> 06:28.034
We're all fleeing something.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.310
War, oppression,
abusive partners.

06:30.413 --> 06:32.206
We try to take care
of each other.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.689
Right. What about Alona?
What was she fleeing?

06:34.793 --> 06:36.379
She didn't share much.

06:36.482 --> 06:37.931
Come on, you expect
us to believe that?

06:38.034 --> 06:39.068
You're hiding something.
Come on, spit it out.

06:39.172 --> 06:40.689
Okay, sit down!

06:41.758 --> 06:44.034
Forgive my companion, he doesn't
like his teeth very much

06:44.137 --> 06:46.241
and is hoping someone
will knock 'em out for him.

06:46.344 --> 06:47.931
I'm sorry.

06:48.758 --> 06:50.482
My bad,
I apologize.

06:50.586 --> 06:51.965
Can you tell me if there
was anything unusual

06:52.068 --> 06:53.448
happening with Alona?

06:53.551 --> 06:55.275
Any fights,
domestic disputes, anything?

06:55.379 --> 06:57.413
No, nothing
like that,

06:57.517 --> 06:58.931
but there was one thing.

06:59.034 --> 07:00.655
What is it?

07:00.758 --> 07:02.310
Um...

07:03.068 --> 07:05.000
Last week
she took a phone call,

07:05.103 --> 07:06.620
got very upset afterwards.

07:06.724 --> 07:07.896
Said it was
the people

07:08.000 --> 07:09.620
who helped her
come to New York.

07:09.724 --> 07:10.896
Great.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.103
I can only imagine
who'd be involved

07:12.206 --> 07:14.206
- in a business like that.
- Exactly.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.137
And she was so shaken up, so...

07:17.241 --> 07:19.034
I took a picture
of the phone number

07:19.137 --> 07:20.344
when she was in the shower.

07:20.448 --> 07:21.551
I'm sorry, I know
I shouldn't have.

07:21.655 --> 07:24.517
No. You should have.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.517
You did good.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.413
Gustavo Abreu.
You really don't remember him?

07:33.517 --> 07:35.034
Not in the vaguest.
He's a cop?
A captain.

07:35.137 --> 07:36.482
Not NYPD, though.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.482
A national police force
out of Venezuela.

07:38.586 --> 07:41.758
I escorted him on a tour
of the precinct back in 2018.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.793
Okay, yeah.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.551
I think
I remember the guy.

07:44.655 --> 07:46.275
But you're
absolutely positive?

07:46.379 --> 07:48.896
The guys upstairs have me
host a ton of those tours.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.103
Good old poster boy
like you? I'm sure.

07:51.206 --> 07:53.793
But this guy really stood out.

07:53.896 --> 07:56.310
He was, you know,
presented well,

07:56.413 --> 07:57.896
he asked
all the right questions,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.413
he was respectable.

07:59.517 --> 08:02.034
He even picked up the tab
for a few drinks after.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.931
That info you
requested, Sarge.

08:04.034 --> 08:05.448
Thank you.

08:06.758 --> 08:07.965
Okay.

08:08.068 --> 08:10.310
"USCIS indicates that
Gustavo Abreu

08:10.413 --> 08:13.413
applied for asylum status
in New York in March of 2019."

08:13.517 --> 08:15.620
- Bingo.
- And get this.

08:15.724 --> 08:17.068
Looks like he's been
working in construction

08:17.172 --> 08:19.068
on a public works
project nearby.

08:22.137 --> 08:23.206
Eyes up, okay?

08:23.310 --> 08:24.241
This guy knows
our playbook,

08:24.344 --> 08:26.068
so no room
for error.

08:32.586 --> 08:33.793
Can I help you?

08:33.896 --> 08:35.482
Yeah, I'm looking
for Gustavo Abreu.

08:35.586 --> 08:36.758
I'm Sergeant Reagan.

08:36.862 --> 08:38.758
Yeah, no problem.

08:38.862 --> 08:40.413
Gustavo!

08:40.517 --> 08:42.000
Come here.

08:42.103 --> 08:43.517
Someone here
to see you.

08:44.448 --> 08:46.344
Thank you.

08:48.103 --> 08:49.413
Put down
the blade, yeah?

08:49.517 --> 08:51.310
I mean no harm, huh?

08:53.344 --> 08:55.137
Gustavo?

08:55.241 --> 08:56.758
You know
why we're here.

08:56.862 --> 08:58.482
Sergeant Reagan.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.068
Come on, let's go.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.586
Hey.

09:01.689 --> 09:02.862
- Hey, hey.
- Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

09:02.965 --> 09:04.172
You know better than that.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.103
Slow.

09:08.862 --> 09:10.586
My wife.

09:11.758 --> 09:13.344
You'll get your call. Come on.

09:13.448 --> 09:15.206
<i>Hola, mi amor.</i>

09:15.310 --> 09:16.724
I'm being detained, but I need
you and the kids to know

09:16.827 --> 09:17.724
everything's gonna be all right.

09:17.827 --> 09:18.931
Uh, this isn't like home.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.344
Give me the phone.

09:20.448 --> 09:21.379
What? Gustavo?

09:21.482 --> 09:22.551
<i>Te quiero con todo mi alma.</i>

09:23.965 --> 09:25.896
You got
anything on you?

09:26.862 --> 09:29.310
So far her story checks out.

09:29.413 --> 09:33.000
Patrol responded to
eight domestic violence jobs

09:33.103 --> 09:34.655
at her residence
in the past year,

09:34.758 --> 09:36.517
all of them logged
at the precinct.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.724
Looks like this may have
fallen through the cracks.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.241
How's that for understatement?

09:41.344 --> 09:43.482
And she got an order
of protection in January,

09:43.586 --> 09:45.172
but he kept coming.

09:45.275 --> 09:46.862
So, fell through the cracks,

09:46.965 --> 09:48.724
and the cracks got paved over.

09:48.827 --> 09:50.827
I know this is
a shock to the system...

09:50.931 --> 09:52.793
Please don't say "but."

09:52.896 --> 09:54.931
...but before
you try to do anything,

09:55.034 --> 09:56.965
you need to know
you can't do anything.

09:57.068 --> 09:58.482
What?

09:58.586 --> 10:00.620
Multiple beatings,
order of protection violated?

10:00.724 --> 10:02.517
I'm just saying this isn't
our purview going forward.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.931
Oh, what the hell's
purview got to do with it?

10:05.034 --> 10:06.689
In that it's in the system now.

10:06.793 --> 10:08.655
We are the system, Garrett.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.413
No, we are just one part of it.

10:10.517 --> 10:12.344
Well, we're
a pretty big part of it.

10:12.448 --> 10:14.482
Should be her husband
looking at 20 years, not her.

10:14.586 --> 10:16.896
Her husband's looking
at the lid of a coffin,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.172
which is why
it's in the hands

10:18.275 --> 10:19.586
of the district
attorney's office.

10:19.689 --> 10:21.137
The D.A. does not respond

10:21.241 --> 10:23.896
to domestic disturbance calls.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
We do.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.310
I know this is difficult.

10:26.413 --> 10:29.551
She did commit murder,
confessed to you,

10:29.655 --> 10:30.931
of all people.

10:31.034 --> 10:32.482
It's simply not your place
to get involved.

10:32.586 --> 10:33.758
But this could be on us.

10:33.862 --> 10:35.310
That's not how the system works.

10:35.413 --> 10:38.103
So she stabs
her husband to death,

10:38.206 --> 10:40.793
and the first thing she does
is run up the block

10:40.896 --> 10:43.379
to the local precinct
and confess.

10:44.172 --> 10:46.793
My detective skills
may be a little rusty,

10:46.896 --> 10:49.137
but that is unusual.

10:49.241 --> 10:52.000
I know the circumstances
are unusual.

10:52.103 --> 10:55.931
I know I can't fix
the whole system, Garrett,

10:56.034 --> 10:59.758
but what I can do
is make sure our part of it

10:59.862 --> 11:02.068
does not fail her again.

11:12.586 --> 11:14.000
- Sorry, another bum lead.
- Yeah.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.413
Hey, Danny,
I-I appreciate you

11:16.517 --> 11:17.551
taking the time, though.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.448
Lending your
know-how and whatnot.

11:19.551 --> 11:20.862
That's right.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.448
How could I say no to
your irresistible charm?

11:24.103 --> 11:26.379
Uh, give me one
second to take this. Yeah.

11:26.482 --> 11:27.931
Okay. Hey.

11:28.034 --> 11:29.517
- Hey.
- You got something for me?

11:29.620 --> 11:31.172
That phone number
you asked me to look into,

11:31.275 --> 11:33.172
it belongs to Bernie Mendez.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.758
Is that a name I should know?

11:34.862 --> 11:37.103
He's an up-and-comer,
runs a family out of Yonkers.

11:37.206 --> 11:40.310
A lot like the one your buddy
Mickey used to run numbers for.

11:40.413 --> 11:42.413
You don't say.

11:42.517 --> 11:44.344
Okay, I'm on it.

11:48.482 --> 11:49.827
What was that?

11:49.931 --> 11:51.586
Uh, just something to do
with my kid's school.

11:51.689 --> 11:53.482
- No big deal.
- All right.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.482
How are you holding up?

12:05.586 --> 12:07.103
About how you think.

12:07.206 --> 12:09.517
I can't make any promises.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.586
I didn't ask for any.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.413
But why are you here?

12:14.517 --> 12:16.000
Well, uh...

12:16.862 --> 12:18.034
I can't turn back time

12:18.137 --> 12:20.827
and put that knife
back in the drawer.

12:20.931 --> 12:22.586
But...

12:26.137 --> 12:27.310
Let me ask you,

12:27.413 --> 12:29.586
the NYPD responded

12:29.689 --> 12:33.103
to eight domestic incidents

12:33.206 --> 12:34.655
at your home.

12:34.758 --> 12:36.241
Do I have that right?

12:36.344 --> 12:38.413
At least eight.

12:38.517 --> 12:41.103
Any idea why your husband

12:41.206 --> 12:44.620
never got anything more
than a slap on the wrist?

12:45.827 --> 12:47.758
Isn't that for you to tell me?

12:48.655 --> 12:50.275
Uh, it's not
a rhetorical question.

12:50.379 --> 12:51.896
I'm...

12:52.000 --> 12:55.275
I'm trying to figure out
what I don't know.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.448
What I told you all
is all I know.

12:59.241 --> 13:02.551
Every time he'd beat me down,
I'd call the cops.

13:02.655 --> 13:05.448
They'd show up,
give him a talking-to,

13:05.551 --> 13:07.448
and be on their way.

13:07.551 --> 13:10.241
You got an order of protection.

13:10.344 --> 13:11.758
That didn't stop him one bit.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.862
Cops didn't stop him neither.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.827
Can you do something for me?

13:20.172 --> 13:23.724
After he violated the order
of protection,

13:23.827 --> 13:26.655
my officers came back
to see you again, didn't they?

13:26.758 --> 13:28.310
Sure did.

13:28.413 --> 13:30.482
And the same old,
same old happened.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.379
Well...

13:33.482 --> 13:35.034
what I'd like you to do

13:35.137 --> 13:36.448
is be as specific as you can

13:36.551 --> 13:40.620
about what
the "same old, same old" was.

13:40.724 --> 13:44.586
Don't leave anything out,
even if it seems trivial.

13:46.241 --> 13:49.965
Reginald'd show up high,
as usual.

13:50.068 --> 13:53.827
Pissed off about
something, as usual...

13:54.827 --> 13:56.896
...and took it out on me
and my arm.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.413
Nearly snapped it in two,
bending it behind my back.

14:00.517 --> 14:02.689
And then you called the cops.

14:03.517 --> 14:05.620
And then the same two
showed up as before.

14:10.862 --> 14:12.862
Same two?

14:13.689 --> 14:16.517
That's right,
the same two every time,

14:16.620 --> 14:20.034
after the first
four, five times.

14:21.482 --> 14:23.000
I'm a...

14:24.586 --> 14:26.689
I'm a little confused here.

14:27.689 --> 14:30.827
At first, cops in uniforms came.

14:31.862 --> 14:34.000
Whoever had the shift, I guess.

14:35.137 --> 14:37.689
Then... one time,

14:37.793 --> 14:41.241
two cops in suits and ties.

14:41.344 --> 14:44.448
After that, only those two.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.551
Night or day, the same two.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.551
Suits and ties. So, detectives.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.310
If you say so.

14:58.413 --> 15:01.241
Did they identify
themselves as detectives?

15:01.344 --> 15:03.034
They flashed their badges.

15:03.137 --> 15:07.586
The only identifying they ever
did was about the other one.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.034
"My partner" this,
"my partner" that,

15:10.137 --> 15:12.034
like they were...

15:12.137 --> 15:13.275
What's that called?

15:13.379 --> 15:15.172
Um...

15:15.275 --> 15:16.689
conjoined twins.

15:16.793 --> 15:19.103
Two halves of a whole.

15:27.689 --> 15:30.896
I didn't resign.
I fled for my life.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.551
Says here you deserted your
post back home without notice.

15:34.655 --> 15:36.068
If I stayed, even another hour,

15:36.172 --> 15:38.034
the same corrupt officials
who wrote that report

15:38.137 --> 15:39.310
would have come after my family.

15:39.413 --> 15:40.862
I didn't have a choice.

15:40.965 --> 15:42.862
What about stealing
from those construction sites?

15:42.965 --> 15:44.448
You didn't have a choice
about that either?

15:44.551 --> 15:45.827
In so many words,

15:45.931 --> 15:46.896
no.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.068
So you admit it was you.

15:50.137 --> 15:52.137
Craig Stutz
and those corrupt officials,

15:52.241 --> 15:53.206
they're not so different.

15:53.310 --> 15:54.965
Stutz threatened your family?

15:55.068 --> 15:58.103
People I've worked with
on other sites.

15:58.206 --> 15:59.965
Laborers, immigrants.

16:00.068 --> 16:02.034
He pays them dirt,
then, when they complain,

16:02.137 --> 16:03.482
he threatens them,

16:03.586 --> 16:05.137
says he knows people
at Immigration.

16:05.241 --> 16:07.310
So you dial 911,
you don't steal his lunch pail.

16:07.413 --> 16:08.655
It's not
that simple.

16:08.758 --> 16:10.620
These laborers,
they believe his lies.

16:10.724 --> 16:12.896
They believe he has
the power to deport them.

16:14.275 --> 16:15.517
They wouldn't cooperate.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.206
Then you make 'em cooperate.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.379
I only took back

16:19.482 --> 16:21.724
what Stutz owed them,
not a penny more.

16:21.827 --> 16:23.965
And how much did you pocket?

16:24.068 --> 16:25.482
None.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.206
I swear to that.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.448
Look, even if
I believed you about Stutz,

16:30.551 --> 16:32.137
I doubt there's anything
we can do about it now.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.724
You've already jeopardized
any case against him.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.793
No... I can prove it.
I can get him to talk.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.517
That's not the way this works.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.103
These are good, hardworking
people he's abused.

16:41.206 --> 16:44.758
A lot of them engineers,
business owners back home.

16:47.103 --> 16:49.517
Please don't punish
these people for my mistakes.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.448
I'm sorry, Gustavo.

16:56.551 --> 16:58.448
You've forced my hand.

17:03.034 --> 17:05.344
It was a left back there.
You just missed it.

17:05.448 --> 17:06.482
Yeah, I know.

17:06.586 --> 17:08.000
So turn around.

17:08.103 --> 17:10.517
You came back east
to get a fresh start?

17:10.620 --> 17:12.310
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.

17:13.137 --> 17:14.517
So why the hell's
Alona getting calls

17:14.620 --> 17:17.034
from a guy like Bernie Mendez, hmm?

17:17.965 --> 17:20.310
Ah, no, Danny, no,
you got this all mixed up.

17:20.413 --> 17:21.827
No, Bernie
swore to me

17:21.931 --> 17:24.379
he had nothing to do
with Alona's disappearance.

17:24.482 --> 17:25.931
Doesn't matter, you should've
told me from the start.

17:26.034 --> 17:28.172
Bernie set me up
with Alona as a favor.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.241
That's it, okay? He heard
about Connie, my situation...

17:30.344 --> 17:31.310
A guy like Bernie

17:31.413 --> 17:33.034
doesn't do
a favor for anyone

17:33.137 --> 17:35.379
unless he's expecting
something in return.

17:35.482 --> 17:36.965
That's not
what this is.

17:37.068 --> 17:38.827
Uh-huh.

17:40.931 --> 17:43.172
This is your stop.

17:43.275 --> 17:45.000
Ah, come on.

17:47.206 --> 17:48.724
Danny.

17:48.827 --> 17:50.482
Get out.

17:52.275 --> 17:53.275
I said get out!

17:53.379 --> 17:55.517
I'm not running with those guys.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.586
Really? Then why'd you call me

17:56.689 --> 17:57.862
instead of calling the cops?

17:57.965 --> 17:59.517
I told you, this was
to protect Alona.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.103
Even now, you're still
lying to me to my face.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.965
Danny, this is
the God's honest truth.

18:04.068 --> 18:06.172
No, it isn't, this is about
you protecting your 20 grand

18:06.275 --> 18:08.137
that you don't want to lose,
and keeping yourself

18:08.241 --> 18:09.482
from getting busted

18:09.586 --> 18:10.862
for whatever other racket
you're involved in.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.620
Fine, fine. That's
what you think of me?

18:12.724 --> 18:13.931
Yeah, that's
what I think.

18:14.034 --> 18:15.620
Fine. Fine, Danny.

18:15.724 --> 18:17.517
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll
see you around.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.103
See you around.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.793
Where is he?

18:26.896 --> 18:28.896
Ain't you ever heard,
"patience is a virtue"?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.655
I like action, okay?
I like results.

18:31.758 --> 18:33.413
What I would like
is Tully Richards

18:33.517 --> 18:34.586
to walk down
that sidewalk,

18:34.689 --> 18:36.275
that's what
I would like.

18:36.379 --> 18:37.310
You like action and results,

18:37.413 --> 18:38.379
and you're running for D.A.?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.172
Good luck with that.

18:41.275 --> 18:42.655
What's that supposed to mean?

18:42.758 --> 18:44.310
Only that
being D.A.

18:44.413 --> 18:45.655
is just being
a politician,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.793
which I'm sure has
its own rewards,

18:47.896 --> 18:50.310
but action and
actual results?

18:50.413 --> 18:53.758
You're gonna be
real disappointed.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.068
Well, how long you been
sitting on that?

18:57.172 --> 18:58.103
Since the beginning?

18:58.206 --> 19:00.275
What are you talking about?

19:00.379 --> 19:02.172
Sounds like you
have strong doubts

19:02.275 --> 19:05.344
that I'll be an effective D.A.

19:06.344 --> 19:07.758
I think you'll make a great D.A.

19:09.896 --> 19:12.655
I just don't understand
why you want it.

19:13.655 --> 19:15.310
Anthony, I've been an A.D.A.

19:15.413 --> 19:18.000
for 20-something years.

19:19.517 --> 19:22.448
Ain't no answer
to my question.

19:23.655 --> 19:24.862
And that's a double negative,

19:24.965 --> 19:27.137
which means I did
answer your question.

19:27.241 --> 19:29.068
Now give me
those chips.

19:32.034 --> 19:34.586
My man. Two times
in the same week.

19:34.689 --> 19:35.689
Must be my lucky day.

19:35.793 --> 19:37.965
I hope so, Johnny.
I hope so.

19:38.068 --> 19:40.413
Take it this isn't
a social call?

19:41.620 --> 19:43.241
Not when a model citizen

19:43.344 --> 19:46.793
strolls through your precinct's
front door covered in blood

19:46.896 --> 19:49.275
and confesses murder to the PC.

19:49.379 --> 19:51.517
So, no, not a social call.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.620
Terrible thing, the whole story.
Just awful.

19:53.724 --> 19:55.551
- It sure is.
- Whatever I can
help you with,

19:55.655 --> 19:57.448
please just say the word.

19:57.551 --> 19:58.758
Yeah, I do have
a question.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.103
Shoot.

20:00.206 --> 20:02.172
You want to tell me
why the complaint reports

20:02.275 --> 20:03.758
on all these domestic jobs

20:03.862 --> 20:05.862
were signed by two
of your patrol officers?

20:05.965 --> 20:07.896
They were
the responding officers.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.068
Except Mrs. Jackson told me
that two detectives

20:10.172 --> 20:12.310
came to the apartment
the last few times.

20:12.413 --> 20:14.103
And she gave

20:14.206 --> 20:17.137
a pretty accurate description
of your Hobbs and Renfro team.

20:17.241 --> 20:20.068
That's not possible.
No, she's got that wrong.

20:20.172 --> 20:22.172
Yeah, well, that's what
I told the boss.

20:22.275 --> 20:25.310
But then I went and checked out
her building security camera.

20:25.413 --> 20:27.000
And lo and behold...

20:27.965 --> 20:29.551
...she's telling the truth.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.448
Well, that ain't right.

20:31.551 --> 20:34.586
And I will certainly
get to the bottom of it.

20:34.689 --> 20:36.896
I'm glad to hear that, Johnny.

20:37.724 --> 20:39.000
Got a lot going on here.

20:39.103 --> 20:41.793
May take a couple of days
to, uh, chase this down.

20:41.896 --> 20:44.655
I hear you,
but get it done, okay?

20:45.448 --> 20:46.689
Will do.

20:55.206 --> 20:56.310
Reagan, you got
to get your head

20:56.413 --> 20:57.620
out of all this
Mickey stuff.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.344
You know, there was a time
that I would have

20:59.448 --> 21:02.379
counted Mickey as
the fourth Reagan boy.

21:02.482 --> 21:04.793
Oh. And now?

21:04.896 --> 21:06.275
Now I just
count him out.

21:08.206 --> 21:10.000
Wow.

21:10.827 --> 21:13.586
Sounds a lot like my brother.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.241
Javi?

21:15.344 --> 21:18.620
Yeah. He was a lot
like your friend.

21:18.724 --> 21:21.448
You know? Always the
boy who cried wolf.

21:21.551 --> 21:24.206
Yeah, till he wasn't.

21:26.448 --> 21:30.344
Caring for someone like
that, it's torture.

21:30.448 --> 21:31.896
Every day,
you've somehow

21:32.000 --> 21:33.517
got to convince yourself,

21:33.620 --> 21:35.517
today's the day
he's changed.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.413
Right.

21:41.172 --> 21:43.103
I don't know why I'm even
entertaining this.

21:43.206 --> 21:44.655
Because you know,
deep down,

21:44.758 --> 21:46.655
it's the right
thing to do.

21:46.758 --> 21:48.827
I can't register you as a C.I.

21:48.931 --> 21:50.206
because you're
a recent immigrant,

21:50.310 --> 21:52.000
which means you have
no ties to the community.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.137
And therefore
I'm a flight risk. I know.

21:54.241 --> 21:55.689
Not to mention trying
to sell it to the D.A.

21:55.793 --> 21:57.965
based on the testimony
of a single serial burglar.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.655
We have to conduct
a thorough investigation.

21:59.758 --> 22:01.517
And by that time,
we'll already be too late.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.896
Check your phone.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.034
What?

22:06.137 --> 22:07.827
One of my guys is
keeping tabs on Stutz.

22:07.931 --> 22:10.241
He sent you
a few pictures.

22:11.827 --> 22:13.862
Stutz is burning
the paper trail.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.137
Pay history, financials

22:15.241 --> 22:17.344
in the shred bins.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.068
Your little Robin Hood act
tipped him off.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.310
So let me fix it
by wearing a wire.

22:23.344 --> 22:24.586
We can
get him on

22:24.689 --> 22:27.379
extortion, coercion
at the very least.

22:27.482 --> 22:29.379
But if we don't act now,
all of this was for nothing.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.413
Maybe that's what you deserve.

22:31.517 --> 22:35.000
You're right, and I'll get
what's coming to me.

22:35.103 --> 22:37.965
But don't let
my pride blind you, too.

22:41.689 --> 22:43.689
This is on me, Sid.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.931
Hobbs and Renfro fessed up.

22:46.034 --> 22:48.965
Then how's it on you?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.758
The captain should know
what's going on in his command,

22:51.862 --> 22:53.655
and I was blindsided on this.

22:55.068 --> 22:57.379
The deceased, Reginald Jackson,

22:57.482 --> 22:59.827
was an informant
they'd cultivated for years.

22:59.931 --> 23:01.758
And not just any C.I.

23:01.862 --> 23:05.241
I can't tell you the number
of cases we closed using him.

23:05.344 --> 23:09.000
So my guys made a judgment call

23:09.103 --> 23:10.862
to keep him on the street.

23:10.965 --> 23:13.413
And out of the system.

23:13.517 --> 23:17.000
Which turned out to have
collateral damage, yeah.

23:18.862 --> 23:22.551
But they were getting close on
closing a major fentanyl ring,

23:22.655 --> 23:23.793
and like I said...

23:23.896 --> 23:25.241
Judgment call.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.517
For God's sakes, John.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.172
So I've put 'em on

23:31.275 --> 23:34.172
modified pending and handed it
up to Internal Affairs.

23:34.275 --> 23:35.931
Too little, too late.

23:36.034 --> 23:38.206
It's not a perfect world.

23:38.310 --> 23:40.344
We're good for now.

23:42.379 --> 23:46.482
But the PC wants us to drop by
while you're up here.

23:49.827 --> 23:51.275
We or me?

23:51.379 --> 23:53.137
We.

23:53.241 --> 23:56.344
And, what, the way things are,
cops out the door,

23:56.448 --> 23:58.172
you think he's gonna
cut loose a captain

23:58.275 --> 23:59.862
for getting blindsided?

23:59.965 --> 24:02.068
It's a drive-by,
just checking in.

24:02.172 --> 24:03.655
Come on, he don't bite.

24:13.931 --> 24:16.965
I have Captain Bates
and Lieutenant Gormley, sir.

24:20.379 --> 24:22.206
Okay.

24:37.551 --> 24:38.896
Please have a seat.

24:40.793 --> 24:42.413
Just the captain.

24:43.517 --> 24:44.724
Boss?

24:44.827 --> 24:47.551
Give us the room, Sid.

25:00.206 --> 25:03.517
That Sid, he is
a bronze statue of a cop.

25:03.620 --> 25:07.896
Sometimes I think he'd
take a bullet for any one of us.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.620
Truer words.

25:10.724 --> 25:13.103
Which is why I conducted

25:13.206 --> 25:15.344
a crucial piece of this myself.

25:15.448 --> 25:19.689
So Sid wouldn't be tempted
to put his thumb on the scale.

25:19.793 --> 25:22.448
Piece of what, sir?

25:22.551 --> 25:25.517
I handled the interviews

25:25.620 --> 25:29.413
of Detectives Hobbs
and Renfro myself.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.241
That piece.

25:40.275 --> 25:42.379
They told me that you said

25:42.482 --> 25:46.068
that they could look
the other way on the domestics

25:46.172 --> 25:50.241
because Jackson's value
as a C.I. trumped.

25:54.758 --> 25:57.448
It's a little more
complicated than that.

25:59.241 --> 26:01.103
You try to tell me
it was for the greater good,

26:01.206 --> 26:03.482
I'm gonna throw you
out that window.

26:07.172 --> 26:09.379
Well...

26:09.482 --> 26:12.551
...not the greater good,
okay? No.

26:12.655 --> 26:13.758
But for a huge case.

26:13.862 --> 26:15.172
I don't care if you were

26:15.275 --> 26:17.034
close to a cure for cancer.

26:17.137 --> 26:21.551
You do not turn that woman
into a punching bag.

26:22.344 --> 26:24.241
That's not what I was doing.

26:25.724 --> 26:28.137
But it is what you did.

26:32.344 --> 26:35.241
All due respect,
you've got this twisted up.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.275
Oh, I'm twisted up, all right.

26:40.068 --> 26:43.206
But not about
the facts of this thing.

26:46.551 --> 26:49.551
Your gun and
your shield, Captain.

26:56.517 --> 26:58.172
Victoria Falls is exactly
what we're looking for.

27:06.344 --> 27:08.448
Show me your passport
and your checkbook.

27:08.551 --> 27:10.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:11.034 --> 27:12.344
You want me
in your life, fine.

27:12.448 --> 27:14.103
You don't get to barge
in here, barking orders.

27:14.206 --> 27:15.517
Come on, just show me
where they are.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.000
We've been through this
already. They're all here.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.586
- It's fine.
- Great, then show me.

27:18.689 --> 27:20.931
All right.

27:25.448 --> 27:27.310
Satisfied?

27:27.413 --> 27:28.310
Almost.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.620
Open up your checking account.

27:29.724 --> 27:30.896
No, not until you admit

27:31.000 --> 27:31.931
that what you said
crossed a line.

27:32.034 --> 27:33.517
Open the checking account.

27:35.827 --> 27:37.379
You know what, Danny?

27:37.482 --> 27:39.137
You're such a...

27:40.137 --> 27:42.172
This makes no sense.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.413
It was all here this morning.

27:44.517 --> 27:46.000
Look at that, every penny gone.

27:46.103 --> 27:47.241
You said Alona had access
to those accounts?

27:47.344 --> 27:49.655
Yeah, of course she does.
She's my fiancé.

27:49.758 --> 27:51.103
No, Bernie...
Bernie swore

27:51.206 --> 27:52.586
he wasn't involved,
but if he was involved,

27:52.689 --> 27:54.965
then she's paid him already.
There goes her leverage.

27:55.068 --> 27:56.758
- Let's not jump to conclusions.
- Let's not?

27:56.862 --> 27:59.137
Love of my life could be lying
dead in a ditch somewhere.

27:59.241 --> 28:00.551
And pacing's
not gonna help either.

28:00.655 --> 28:01.655
We got to go to the bank,

28:01.758 --> 28:02.689
start pulling security footage.

28:02.793 --> 28:03.689
The only thing we have to do

28:03.793 --> 28:05.206
and the only hope we have

28:05.310 --> 28:06.482
is to get the NYPD involved.

28:06.586 --> 28:08.103
You're the NYPD.

28:08.206 --> 28:09.482
No, I'm your friend.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.689
We need to get them
officially involved.

28:11.793 --> 28:14.172
I don't know, Danny, if they
find out how Alona and I met...

28:14.275 --> 28:17.310
She may be looking at time.
And you might, too.

28:18.379 --> 28:20.241
It's the only chance
we got to save her life.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.551
You sure
about this?

28:23.655 --> 28:24.758
You sure you love her?

28:24.862 --> 28:26.655
I love her, man. I'm all in.

28:27.689 --> 28:29.310
Then I got to call it in.

28:30.517 --> 28:31.551
All right, yeah.

28:31.655 --> 28:32.689
Just do it

28:32.793 --> 28:33.793
before I lose
my nerve.

28:33.896 --> 28:35.448
Okay.

28:39.827 --> 28:41.379
Chips?

28:42.413 --> 28:44.482
Slice?

28:44.586 --> 28:46.448
Candy?

28:46.551 --> 28:48.551
Come on,
- you love these.
- He's on the move.

28:48.655 --> 28:50.655
11 o'clock.

28:57.896 --> 28:59.068
- Okay, hop out.
- What?

28:59.172 --> 29:01.000
Not a chance in hell.
I'm going with you.

29:01.103 --> 29:02.275
Over my dead body.

29:02.379 --> 29:04.172
Get out now.
And call the precinct.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.206
Tell them to pick you up.

29:07.344 --> 29:09.344
And stay on the radio
in case I need backup.

29:15.827 --> 29:18.000
Never gonna forgive
you for this, Anthony.

29:18.103 --> 29:19.344
Off the air unless it's urgent.

29:29.034 --> 29:29.931
Police.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.620
Out of the car now.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.965
Anthony, I think
we have a problem here.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.068
Put your hands where I can see
'em. Come on, out of the car.

29:40.172 --> 29:41.655
Come on, move it.
Open the trunk.

29:41.758 --> 29:42.793
Hey, man. Damn.

29:42.896 --> 29:44.275
Anthony.

29:47.517 --> 29:48.689
Step away.

29:48.793 --> 29:50.206
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.344
Now.

30:02.379 --> 30:03.275
Hey!

30:03.379 --> 30:05.137
Where do you think you're going?

30:14.620 --> 30:17.379
Hey, what you thought you
was gonna find, big man, hmm?

30:18.172 --> 30:20.551
Drugs?

30:21.793 --> 30:23.172
Keep laughing.

30:23.275 --> 30:25.241
Uh-oh, he's
calling for backup.

30:26.413 --> 30:27.206
Hey, Erin,

30:27.310 --> 30:28.827
yeah, we got a problem.

30:28.931 --> 30:29.862
Yeah, what's that?

30:29.965 --> 30:31.206
We've been duped.

30:31.310 --> 30:32.137
There's nothing but
laundry in the duffel bag.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.517
Well, that's because

30:33.620 --> 30:35.620
I've got ten pounds
of coke in this one.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.965
You are amazing, Reagan.

30:43.068 --> 30:44.896
Just amazing.

30:59.413 --> 31:00.724
The microphone
in your cell phone

31:00.827 --> 31:02.448
is amplified, but
it's still weak,

31:02.551 --> 31:05.172
so you need to make sure you're
near the subject as he speaks.

31:05.275 --> 31:07.344
You act like I haven't done
this a dozen times, Sergeant.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.586
Don't you worry about me.

31:14.344 --> 31:15.758
<i>Oye.</i>

31:15.862 --> 31:17.000
<i>Me debes mucho dinero.</i>

31:17.103 --> 31:19.034
<i>Págame ahora.</i>

31:19.137 --> 31:20.206
What the hell is this?

31:20.310 --> 31:21.793
<i>Te dije, me debes mucho dinero,</i>

31:21.896 --> 31:23.655
<i>estúpido.</i>

31:24.689 --> 31:25.655
<i>¿Eres sordo?</i>

31:25.758 --> 31:28.724
English, do you speak it?

31:28.827 --> 31:30.413
You stole from
my cousin Gabriel.

31:30.517 --> 31:32.793
I don't know who that is.

31:32.896 --> 31:34.068
Gabriel Perez is
one of the laborers

31:34.172 --> 31:35.620
on your Cobble Hill project
for two months.

31:35.724 --> 31:37.241
You didn't pay him $3,000.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.068
Take it up with
the Better Business Bureau.

31:39.172 --> 31:41.241
They're not the ones
who skimped him.

31:41.344 --> 31:44.793
You know, you don't sound
like you're from around here.

31:44.896 --> 31:47.965
Do you have
any identification on you?

31:48.068 --> 31:49.344
Come on, that's it.

31:49.448 --> 31:50.724
What's it to you?

31:50.827 --> 31:52.620
I got a few friends over at ICE.

31:52.724 --> 31:54.655
They wouldn't take too kindly
to someone like you

31:54.758 --> 31:56.379
making accusations like this.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.137
Someone like me?

31:58.965 --> 32:00.827
Your cousin was lucky
to have a job.

32:00.931 --> 32:03.862
Five dollars an hour
doesn't seem very lucky to me.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.827
Oh, wow.

32:10.931 --> 32:14.034
You people have gotten
so greedy these days.

32:14.137 --> 32:15.379
Listen,

32:15.482 --> 32:18.517
you want to file a complaint?
Be my guest.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.206
I'll have
your whole family deported

32:20.310 --> 32:21.655
by the end of the month.

32:22.827 --> 32:25.517
That loud enough
for you, Sergeant?

32:30.931 --> 32:32.034
Gustavo?

32:35.206 --> 32:36.172
What the hell
was that?

32:36.275 --> 32:37.448
We lost audio, Sarge.

32:37.551 --> 32:39.275
I'm going in.
Put it over the air.

32:39.379 --> 32:40.655
10-4.

32:52.551 --> 32:53.551
Where is he?

32:53.655 --> 32:55.482
- That way.
- Stay there.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.448
Don't move.
Hands where I can see 'em.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.655
You get eyes
on him this way?

33:18.758 --> 33:20.551
No sign. Let's check
the other side.

33:30.827 --> 33:32.344
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

33:32.448 --> 33:35.137
Bernie Mendez isn't involved,

33:35.241 --> 33:37.689
and Alona's not in danger.

33:38.482 --> 33:42.413
In fact, her name's
not even Alona.

33:48.482 --> 33:50.275
Wha... Well, that can't be right

33:50.379 --> 33:51.379
because if that's right, then...

33:51.482 --> 33:52.551
Troopers pickedher up

33:52.655 --> 33:54.172
at a gas station
in Garden City,

33:54.275 --> 33:57.310
every last dollar of yours
stuffed into the rim

33:57.413 --> 33:58.896
of her spare tire.

34:04.482 --> 34:07.448
Is she even from the Ukraine?

34:09.344 --> 34:10.586
No.

34:15.413 --> 34:17.000
You still with me?

34:18.551 --> 34:20.793
Yeah.

34:24.068 --> 34:25.758
Yeah, I'm here.

34:26.586 --> 34:28.241
What the hell
are you smiling about?

34:28.344 --> 34:29.931
'Cause it all
makes sense finally,

34:30.034 --> 34:30.862
doesn't it, Danny?

34:30.965 --> 34:32.482
No shot a girl like that's

34:32.586 --> 34:34.310
ever gonna love
a schmuck like me.

34:34.413 --> 34:35.620
Don't go there.

34:35.724 --> 34:38.000
How many others guys
she pull this scam on?

34:38.103 --> 34:39.551
How many?

34:43.620 --> 34:45.586
Well, there you have it.

34:46.448 --> 34:48.620
There it is, Danny.

34:48.724 --> 34:50.413
The great Mickey Patrick

34:50.517 --> 34:53.000
ain't nothing more
than a dime a dozen.

35:02.068 --> 35:03.103
What's that?

35:03.206 --> 35:04.827
Three grand.

35:04.931 --> 35:07.758
Till the Feds make you whole.

35:08.896 --> 35:11.206
That way you won't
have to go to Bernie.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.620
Uh... Danny, I can't.

35:13.724 --> 35:15.586
But you will.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.000
I don't know
how to thank you, Danny.

35:31.103 --> 35:32.206
For everything.

35:32.310 --> 35:34.413
Friend of mine told me...

35:35.965 --> 35:37.517
...you got to hang on to hope

35:37.620 --> 35:40.034
with a guy
like you.

35:41.517 --> 35:44.034
That's my way of trying.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.241
I guess we're not gonna be
drinking buddies anytime soon.

35:48.344 --> 35:50.482
No, I don't think it'll
ever be the way it was,

35:50.586 --> 35:53.000
but, who knows, you, uh...

35:53.103 --> 35:55.103
you pay me back someday,

35:55.206 --> 35:57.758
whenever that may be,

35:57.862 --> 35:59.206
maybe we'll get a beer.

35:59.310 --> 36:00.724
I'd like that.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.551
Me, too.

36:05.689 --> 36:07.413
Take care of yourself, okay?

36:08.275 --> 36:10.586
You, too, Danny.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.517
What I want is a good,
old-fashioned

36:23.620 --> 36:26.758
"lead the 5:00 news" perp walk.

36:26.862 --> 36:28.689
Frank, hang on
a minute.

36:28.793 --> 36:30.103
You don't think they deserve it?

36:30.206 --> 36:31.379
Of course they do,

36:31.482 --> 36:32.862
but perp-walk
three of our own?

36:32.965 --> 36:35.931
A precinct captain
and two high-ranking detectives?

36:36.034 --> 36:37.413
What about it?

36:37.517 --> 36:39.206
Well, it'd be a very big deal.

36:39.310 --> 36:40.793
Damn right.

36:40.896 --> 36:43.413
'Cause this is a very big deal.

36:43.517 --> 36:45.758
Police union presidents
will have a cow.

36:47.275 --> 36:48.482
Well, let 'em.

36:48.586 --> 36:49.862
Two wrongs don't make a right,

36:49.965 --> 36:52.137
to quote
a million people and you.

36:52.241 --> 36:55.034
Okay, how would I be wrong?

36:56.275 --> 36:59.655
The department, this department
that you run,

36:59.758 --> 37:01.517
has long-standing protocols

37:01.620 --> 37:04.448
for handling officers
charged with wrongdoing.

37:04.551 --> 37:05.862
Perp walks ain't one of 'em.

37:05.965 --> 37:08.655
Yeah, I know, modified duty
and suspension

37:08.758 --> 37:10.172
pending outcome
of the investigation.

37:10.275 --> 37:11.551
Yes.

37:11.655 --> 37:13.310
But, look, Angela Jackson

37:13.413 --> 37:16.896
killed her chronically abusive
husband in self-defense

37:17.000 --> 37:20.620
after we repeatedly ignored
her cries for help.

37:20.724 --> 37:21.655
Nobody's defending... And now she's

37:21.758 --> 37:23.689
sitting in a cell in Rikers.

37:24.862 --> 37:27.551
Is she on modified duty, too?

37:27.655 --> 37:31.137
No, this is the process
in place also.

37:31.241 --> 37:32.896
It's all we have.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.379
Boss, I'd like to pick up
a flamethrower, too, but...

37:36.482 --> 37:37.482
Look...

37:37.586 --> 37:39.137
I love my church,

37:39.241 --> 37:40.551
I value my faith,

37:40.655 --> 37:42.137
so I know that pride's a sin.

37:42.241 --> 37:44.620
But what if the show we put on

37:44.724 --> 37:46.896
isn't for our benefit?

37:47.000 --> 37:50.068
It's for the benefit
of someone else.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.068
Mrs. Jackson.

37:53.172 --> 37:54.827
Yeah, I think
she'd get a big kick

37:54.931 --> 37:58.172
out of seeing us put those three
through a perp walk.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.655
Boss, as hard as this is to say,

38:03.758 --> 38:06.758
I can't carry out that command.

38:07.724 --> 38:09.758
He didn't actually
give the order, Sid.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.103
He didn't?

38:18.172 --> 38:19.689
No, he didn't.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.482
Then... what?

38:31.344 --> 38:33.551
Just a bit of wishful thinking.

38:36.241 --> 38:38.103
Thanks for hearing me out.

38:42.241 --> 38:44.620
That dirtbag
has been dealing drugs to kids

38:44.724 --> 38:46.034
for nearly a decade,

38:46.137 --> 38:49.482
and we just put his ass
away for a dozen years.

38:49.586 --> 38:51.448
Eligible for parole
in five, though.

38:51.551 --> 38:52.724
Regardless,

38:52.827 --> 38:54.827
we got the bad guy
and we locked him up.

38:54.931 --> 38:56.586
We, huh?

38:57.655 --> 38:59.724
Forgive me. You.
It was all you,

38:59.827 --> 39:01.413
and I mean that sincerely.

39:01.517 --> 39:03.482
You were
incredible out there.

39:03.586 --> 39:05.034
Okay, any reason why

39:05.137 --> 39:07.655
you're blowing
smoke up my butt?

39:07.758 --> 39:09.241
I'm not gonna
touch that one,

39:09.344 --> 39:11.448
thank you very much.

39:11.551 --> 39:14.172
I know what you're
getting at, Anthony.

39:14.275 --> 39:15.586
Why would Igive up

39:15.689 --> 39:17.172
all the fun
that we have

39:17.275 --> 39:19.517
for the drudgery
of politics?

39:19.620 --> 39:22.068
This is where
you belong, kiddo.

39:23.344 --> 39:25.689
I'm not so sure
about that.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.482
Come on.

39:27.586 --> 39:28.758
Tell me you
didn't love the thrill

39:28.862 --> 39:30.689
of taking
that guy down?

39:32.551 --> 39:34.620
Honestly, that
never gets old.

39:39.896 --> 39:41.620
<i>So, yes, I think
I did the right thing,</i>

39:41.724 --> 39:43.586
but my version of
the right thing meant

39:43.689 --> 39:45.517
getting egg on my face
when Gustavo ghosted me

39:45.620 --> 39:48.034
and getting a three-day rip
for losing him.

39:51.310 --> 39:52.620
Okay, but what's
the alternative?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.448
Check the patrol guide
against your gut?

39:54.551 --> 39:55.586
- No.
- Good, 'cause

39:55.689 --> 39:58.000
you'd be
a day late to everything.

39:58.103 --> 39:59.896
Yeah, but he would've
saved the embarrassment

40:00.000 --> 40:01.517
and the pay loss
of a three-day rip.

40:01.620 --> 40:03.620
Just saying.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.275
Well, don't keep score.

40:05.379 --> 40:07.379
That's the secret.

40:07.482 --> 40:11.586
The grind... is the actual job.

40:11.689 --> 40:13.965
Respect the grind.

40:14.068 --> 40:15.655
Embrace the grind.

40:15.758 --> 40:18.655
Wins and losses come with,
but they aren't it.

40:21.482 --> 40:23.034
Well, that is some
sales pitch, Dad.

40:23.137 --> 40:26.793
The NYPD-- come for the thrills
but stay for the grind.

40:28.931 --> 40:31.000
No, I mean, he's kind
of right, though.

40:31.103 --> 40:33.344
I mean, you fall in love
with that first big win,

40:33.448 --> 40:36.000
but you're really married to
the day-in, day-out grind of it.

40:36.103 --> 40:37.827
You talking about
him or the job?

40:38.931 --> 40:40.103
Oh, clearly, him.
Probably both, gentlemen.

40:40.206 --> 40:41.724
The job.

40:41.827 --> 40:43.551
Life with him
is nothing but winning.

40:43.655 --> 40:45.586
Aw.

40:45.689 --> 40:46.827
That's my story,
I'm sticking to it,

40:46.931 --> 40:48.413
and you all can
eat your hearts out.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.000
Hey.

40:51.172 --> 40:52.206
What?

40:52.310 --> 40:53.827
Nothing.

40:53.931 --> 40:56.965
That nothing
is something. Come on.

40:59.896 --> 41:03.310
I did a couple days
on a stakeout.

41:03.413 --> 41:05.724
And it was raw
and rainy,

41:05.827 --> 41:07.379
and a couple thousand calories

41:07.482 --> 41:09.068
of cold pizza

41:09.172 --> 41:10.965
and potato chips.

41:12.517 --> 41:13.517
So, did you get the guy?

41:13.620 --> 41:15.172
Yeah, we got him.

41:15.275 --> 41:16.689
So we won, but

41:16.793 --> 41:19.344
the real win was
hanging with Anthony

41:19.448 --> 41:22.586
and, well, the grind.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.000
- And there it is.
- Mm-hmm.

41:27.034 --> 41:30.551
Well, I got had
by Mickey Patrick. Again.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.344
- Again?
- Again.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.310
Is he still walking the Earth?

41:34.413 --> 41:36.241
Slithering is more
like it, Grandpa.

41:36.344 --> 41:37.793
And yes, he is.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.034
And if he ever
comes around

41:39.137 --> 41:40.241
looking for a favor

41:40.344 --> 41:41.344
from his cop
friend again...

41:41.448 --> 41:42.827
You'll get had again?

41:42.931 --> 41:44.551
I probably will.

41:46.862 --> 41:50.137
Well, to scratch out
some payback

41:50.241 --> 41:51.482
for a woman I barely met,

41:51.586 --> 41:53.724
I, uh, terminated

41:53.827 --> 41:55.896
a captain and two detectives,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.172
which I could not afford to do.

42:01.275 --> 42:03.413
But you did.

42:03.517 --> 42:06.931
No real wins there, just...

42:07.034 --> 42:08.862
the grind.

42:08.965 --> 42:10.586
Well, I'm sorry, guys,

42:10.689 --> 42:12.482
but it sounds like you're
all a little mixed-up.

42:12.586 --> 42:14.620
I think you mean
"ass-backwards."

42:14.724 --> 42:16.034
I'd say "committed."

42:16.137 --> 42:18.000
Maybe we should all be
committed, like Bellevue.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.034
Right.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.965
Hey.

42:21.724 --> 42:24.413
Glass half-empty or half-full?

42:24.517 --> 42:26.103
Half-full.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.000
- Half-full.
- Half-full.

42:30.068 --> 42:31.310
There you go.

42:31.413 --> 42:33.241
To better days.

42:33.344 --> 42:35.965
To better days.
