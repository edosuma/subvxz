He's dead!

Zoe, she left me cos...

(HEAVY EXHALE)

12:05.250 --> 12:07.170
Not much further, yeah?

12:07.290 --> 12:09.210
Two minutes. I promise.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.810
You all right? Yeah. Yeah.
Two...three...

12:15.610 --> 12:17.250
Right. We're here.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.890
Pop it down here.

12:19.050 --> 12:22.330
That's great, that. I really
appreciate it. Thanks for that.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.370
I'll give you a hand getting it in.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.650
(DOG BARKS)
Erm...

12:26.770 --> 12:28.410
You Neil?

12:28.530 --> 12:29.730
Yeah.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.770
So, this is it, yeah?

12:33.050 --> 12:34.610
Yeah.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.330
Yeah, the condition is not as good
as you said, though, is it?

12:40.970 --> 12:42.930
What did we say? 45?

12:43.050 --> 12:44.530
Yeah.

12:44.650 --> 12:46.570
Yeah. If you're happy with that?

12:46.690 --> 12:48.490
There's no fire labels here.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.530
Well, I'll get you some fire labels.

12:50.690 --> 12:53.170
Well, it still won't be fireproof,
will it?

12:54.730 --> 12:55.970
35?

12:57.410 --> 13:00.250
Look, sorry to waste your time,
lads. It's not for me.

13:00.370 --> 13:02.290
(GROANS) For fuck's sake.

13:02.450 --> 13:06.130
Cheeky bastard! I give you a sofa
for free and you try and sell it on?

13:06.250 --> 13:07.930
I thought I was helping you out.

13:08.130 --> 13:11.810
Don't give me that shit. It wasn't
about helping about. You wanted to
get rid of it.

13:11.970 --> 13:13.930
Wait, wait, wait!
Can't leave it here.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.170
Leave it for the council.
They'll take it.

13:16.290 --> 13:17.650
Can't just chuck it away.

13:17.810 --> 13:20.090
Ain't gonna get nothing for this.
Piece of shit, mate.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.130
A piece of shit? It was worth 45 quid
about two minutes ago.

13:23.290 --> 13:25.490
I'm not leaving it here.
I got this with my ex.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.570
What, she leave you for someone
with a better taste in sofas?

13:28.730 --> 13:31.930
(SIGHS) What are you moaning about?
It's just a bloody sofa.

13:32.090 --> 13:35.450
It's just a sofa to you. It isn't to
me. It's ten years of my life, this.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.610
Just chucking it away, it's
like...like it never happened.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.050
(SIGHS)

13:40.170 --> 13:41.730
Do you know what?

13:41.850 --> 13:43.930
You should just keep it.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.930
This obviously means so much to you.

13:47.090 --> 13:50.170
I don't know why you were giving it
away in the first place.

13:50.450 --> 13:54.090
I don't know what I was thinking.
I don't know why I bought a new one.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.130
Nothing but a ball ache.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.170
Can you do us a favour?

13:59.570 --> 14:01.530
Take it back.

14:01.650 --> 14:03.570
Yeah, man, of course. Grab hold.

14:03.730 --> 14:05.610
That'll be 20 quid.
Eh?

14:07.490 --> 14:10.130
Well, a delivery firm
will charge you 40. You...

14:11.850 --> 14:14.570
20 quid. I'm saving you money
and helping you out.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.410
Not really, no. Cos it wouldn't be
here if it weren't for you.

14:17.570 --> 14:20.450
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)
Hang on, hang on. I'll get this.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.370
Hello.
Where are you?

14:22.490 --> 14:24.490
There's been a slight change of plan.

14:25.650 --> 14:29.370
The service is about to start.
Are you on your way? I'll be there.

14:29.530 --> 14:33.170
I'm taking the sofa back. I thought
you said some guy was gonna take it.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.410
Yeah. I changed my mind. Gonna keep
that, get the money back.

14:36.610 --> 14:41.650
Then treat Zoe to a nice weekend
away, a sit-down dinner somewhere.
Sort of charm her back.

14:41.810 --> 14:46.210
You're the only man I know that has
an on-off relationship with a sofa!

14:46.330 --> 14:47.730
All right. I'll see you in a bit.

14:47.890 --> 14:50.890
Right. Come on. Let's get a move on.
Good. Come on.

14:52.610 --> 14:55.610
Do we have to go all the way back?
Yeah. All the way, yeah.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.850
And you can give us a hand
getting it in.

14:58.010 --> 15:04.210
# I'd like to walk around
in your mind some day... #

15:06.290 --> 15:08.610
I think I'd like to have a barge
one day.

15:08.730 --> 15:10.850
You know? It's the dream, innit?

15:10.970 --> 15:12.890
Just go anywhere on a barge.

15:13.050 --> 15:15.890
It's water, innit?
It's where all life began.

15:16.050 --> 15:18.650
I don't understand
why you're looking so happy.

15:18.810 --> 15:21.690
You gave some bloke 20 quid to take
your sofa for a walk!

15:21.810 --> 15:23.170
I thought we'd decided.

15:23.370 --> 15:27.370
I thought the whole point was
getting rid of the old sofa,
get a new sofa and move on.

15:27.530 --> 15:30.810
It's not the sofa I've got to change.
It's me who has got to change.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.650
Can you just listen to me?
I'm not gonna listen to you.
I'm sick of listening to you

15:34.850 --> 15:38.690
That's your problem.
You keep talking, but you're not
listening to anyone else.

15:38.890 --> 15:43.050
Look what happened with Zoe. When she
brought up marriage that time,
what did you do?

15:43.210 --> 15:46.290
You just closed the door on it.
Oh, no, no, that's not for me.

15:46.490 --> 15:51.290
Then it was kids. You nipped that in
the bud, you didn't want to know.
Never listened to what she wanted.

15:51.450 --> 15:55.090
In the end, that's probably why she
fucked off. You're just too negative.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.450
Yeah, but... Hang on.
That's how we work.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.290
I'm too negative.
You're too positive.

15:59.450 --> 16:02.410
Like a battery. It wouldn't work
with both ends being positive.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.930

Supposed to be at
my uncle's funeral today. Yeah?

17:26.930 --> 17:29.410
They'll be cremating me
if I don't get a drink.

17:29.530 --> 17:31.050
Are you thirsty? Gasping.

17:31.250 --> 17:36.090
Over there, you can get anything you
want. A bit of food, if you want.
A bit of pizza or summat.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.130
Here. Pop it down here.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.170
I'll sort you out and go get it.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.770
Just a Coke, yeah. Cheers.
Nowt to eat?

17:42.890 --> 17:44.570
And a banana, if they've got one.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.170
Can I have some money?

17:46.290 --> 17:48.090
I gave you a 20 before.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.770
Yeah, but that's for
the delivery of the sofa.

17:50.890 --> 17:52.650
A banana and a Coke.

17:52.810 --> 17:56.170
Is it all right if I get something
as well? Yeah. Treat yourself.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.810
Just be quick, yeah?
Brilliant. Two minutes.

I wonder if you can help me.
I had a sofa delivered this morning.

18:12.530 --> 18:16.890
I want to say thank you very much
for taking the trouble to be here
for Vincent...

18:17.050 --> 18:19.930
Well, Vinnie, as I think most of you
would have known him...

18:20.090 --> 18:22.690
"I'm not here. Leave a message."
(Where are you?)

18:24.410 --> 18:26.850
The service is starting
and you're not here.

18:27.010 --> 18:30.170
I know that our thoughts are
very much with Norma

18:30.290 --> 18:32.890
and, er, his favourite nephew Karl.

18:33.050 --> 18:35.730
"The person you're calling knows
you're waiting.

18:35.930 --> 18:39.770
Please hold the line. The person
you're calling knows you're
waiting."

18:39.970 --> 18:45.650
What? Did you honestly think he was
gonna come trotting back with a nice
little picnic for both of you?

18:45.810 --> 18:48.370
He's sodded off with your money,
you nob-head.

18:48.490 --> 18:50.410
Can we just get to the funeral?

18:50.570 --> 18:53.290
All this sofa stuff, it's been
nothing but hassle.

18:53.410 --> 18:54.850
Gotta move on.

18:55.050 --> 18:59.610
Look at Norma. She's cremating her
husband today. She's not moping
about like this, is she?

18:59.770 --> 19:03.330
Could learn from her. You've sort of
got this odd thing in your head

19:03.490 --> 19:06.370
that by keeping that sofa
that Zoe is gonna come back.

19:06.570 --> 19:10.530
It's not gonna happen.
You've got to let go of the sofa
and let go of Zoe.

19:10.690 --> 19:13.610
All you seem to be good at letting
go of is 20 quid notes.

19:13.730 --> 19:16.130
Miss me a little.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.850
But not for long.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.930
And not with your head bent low.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.850
Remember the love
that once we shared.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.970
Miss me, but let me go.

take and each must go alone.'
