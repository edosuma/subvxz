00:39.506 --> 00:42.202
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.570
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.079 --> 00:47.979
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.148 --> 00:49.911
You're so sweet.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.347
I wish I could take you with me
when I go, but I can't.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.420
So yesterday, a few patients
were compelled to work on this thing.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.920
And today, it's the entire hospital.

00:58.091 --> 01:01.390
If we get Tess out of here,
do you think this compulsion will fade?

01:01.561 --> 01:05.122
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

01:05.298 --> 01:09.166
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

01:09.335 --> 01:14.568
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

01:32.725 --> 01:35.455
Enough running, Dr. Burkhoff.
You need to come with us now.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.593
No. Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.097
That's very reassuring.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.197
We'll keep that in mind.

01:43.369 --> 01:47.396
No! No! No!

02:30.683 --> 02:31.741
Mr. Tyler.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.716
Come in. What can I do for you?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.823
I wanted to ask you about your work
with the students here.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.016
Sure. I teach three classes.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.526
- History, arts and--
- I'm not talking about your teaching.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.658
I was talking about the counseling
that you do.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.926
I understand you use your ability
with the kids.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.100
That's right.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.967
My ability is to help them focus
their abilities.

02:54.140 --> 02:57.109
It's pretty much what I've been doing
ever since I came back.

02:57.277 --> 03:00.735
If a student has a talent,
like all of our kids here do,

03:00.914 --> 03:02.848
I help them learn how to use it.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.608
Gain control of it.
Build their confidence.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.217
Does it work with adults?

03:06.386 --> 03:11.085
It didn't use to, but I haven't tried it
since I've been off the inhibitor. Why?

03:22.702 --> 03:25.796
I developed this ability
a few months ago.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.374
Telekinesis.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.037
What a word. I can't even say it
with a straight face.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.148
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- I've just been pretending it isn't there.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.742
I mean, I know a little bit about it.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.580
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.551
Little stuff.

03:44.657 --> 03:48.718
And when I'm mad or excited,
I can do a lot more with it.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.159
And you're looking
to control it when you're calm?

03:52.298 --> 03:54.892
Yeah. That's why I'm here, I guess.

03:55.368 --> 03:59.327
How many times do I have
to go over this with you people?

03:59.505 --> 04:04.340
I have not been injecting promicin
into anyone but myself.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.670
You're certain of that?

04:06.179 --> 04:08.238
You're a world-class scientist.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.939
I find it difficult to believe
you wouldn't build a redundancy plan

04:11.117 --> 04:12.141
into your experiment.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.650
This isn't your basic sleep study.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.812
I mean, look at me.

04:16.990 --> 04:21.188
Do you think I'd have an easy time
finding volunteers?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.660
No, I do not.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.674
You look like you're in quite a bit
of discomfort to me.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.142
Yes.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.947
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- Well, you can relax now.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.777
The experiment's over.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.713
This will only hurt a minute.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.688
Bag him.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.833
We'll take him back for the autopsy.

05:14.847 --> 05:19.443
Get Dr. Burkhoff up there quickly.
We promised results by the morning.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.705
Mommy?

06:48.875 --> 06:52.777
Mommy? Mom? Are you okay?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.737
Of course, sweetie. I'm fine.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.246
Why wouldn't I be?

06:57.417 --> 07:01.012
I had a bad dream. You were in it.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.918
Well, why don't you get in
and tell me about it?

07:09.028 --> 07:11.428
You turned into a monster.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.827
It was horrible.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.493
It seemed so real.

07:16.669 --> 07:21.697
It was you, but you were different.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.774
What kind of a monster?

07:27.213 --> 07:29.875
Nice. Something
for the refrigerator door?

07:30.716 --> 07:32.343
You don't think
there's anything to this?

07:32.518 --> 07:34.247
It's not a prediction, right?
Just a bad dream.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.354
Well, I hope so.
But when your daughter is a precog,

07:36.522 --> 07:39.548
you don't want her giving you
a picture like this.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.956
Hello, this is Skouris.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.694
Well, thank you for calling me back.

07:44.864 --> 07:48.664
- Let me know if you see him, all right?
- Everything okay?

07:48.835 --> 07:51.235
Maybe. I'm not sure.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.269
I mean, that was the 4400 Center.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.168
I was hoping maybe they'd seen
Dr. Burkhoff.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.037
I stopped by his apartment yesterday,
and he wasn't home.

07:58.211 --> 08:02.671
Diana, why would you be stopping
by Dr. Burkhoff's apartment?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.974
You actually saw the wound
in Kevin's hand heal over?

08:06.152 --> 08:09.918
Yes. He pulled the scalpel out,
and it was gone within seconds.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.584
He's developing an ability.
I mean, he's close to it anyway.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.193
He says it comes and goes.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.022
What?

08:19.198 --> 08:21.723
Anyone else developing a 4400 ability
I should know about?

08:22.134 --> 08:24.864
- I should have told you earlier.
- You're damn right you should have.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.396
Gotta hand it to you, Diana.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.403
Some people play racquetball
in their spare time,

08:28.574 --> 08:29.905
maybe collect old records, but you,

08:30.076 --> 08:31.737
you play lgor to the one man who...

08:33.546 --> 08:36.845
Well, if he has developed an ability
like you say,

08:37.015 --> 08:39.416
maybe he really is the father
of 4400 technology.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.450
Just like the future predicted.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.013
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?

08:45.424 --> 08:47.551
I thought we were.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.024
And now I'm not so sure.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.193
And that's what I'm worried about.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.264
Tom, what if someone else finds out
what he's up to?

08:54.433 --> 08:55.422
Well, if he succeeds,

08:55.601 --> 08:58.695
we could be talking about the mass
marketing of 4400 abilities.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.635
I'm sure a lot of people would like
to keep that genie in the bottle.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.571
Make our jobs even easier.
Are you--? Are you okay?

09:04.744 --> 09:07.440
Yeah, it's just my allergies.
They're acting up.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.544
I've already spoken to his family. They
haven't heard from him in months.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.877
Okay, so who else is he close to?

09:13.352 --> 09:16.981
"'l didn't know that Cheshire cats
always grinned.

09:17.156 --> 09:22.253
In fact, I didn't know cats could grin,"
said Alice very politely.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.020
"'You don't know much,"
said the duchess.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.295
"And that's a fact."

09:30.436 --> 09:32.961
We'll finish this chapter tomorrow.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.198
I hope you all can make it.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.343
I've been living in a halfway house
for about three months.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.071
And I got this job here
two weeks ago.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.236
Well, that's great, Tess.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.440
So they found a medication
that works for you?

09:44.617 --> 09:47.745
Well, so far, so good.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.583
I still have my disease.
Schizophrenia never goes away.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.454
But I haven't had any symptoms
for a while.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.653
Hopefully, I won't.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.024
So these kids you're reading to,

09:59.198 --> 10:03.032
they're not going to try and build
a tower to contact the future, are they?

10:05.204 --> 10:07.195
I don't think so.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.069
I can barely remember all that now.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.836
I'm still not sure how I could
compel people to work

10:13.012 --> 10:17.176
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.582
I'm glad it made Kevin better.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.721
But it was still so weird.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.288
That's actually why we're here.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.050
Have you been in touch
with Kevin lately?

10:27.693 --> 10:32.494
No. I called him when I first got out
of the institution, but...

10:32.665 --> 10:34.895
We met for coffee...

10:35.301 --> 10:37.201
I haven't seen him in months.
Is he okay?

10:37.370 --> 10:39.497
Well, we're not sure,
but we'd like to talk to him.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.641
So if he contacts you,
would you let us know?

10:42.808 --> 10:43.968
Of course.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.907
When you find him,
will you have him call me?

10:47.079 --> 10:49.309
Sure. It's nice to see you again, Tess.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.179
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.247
I just spoke with the program
coordinator.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.084
She says the first segment
will be interviews

10:59.258 --> 11:00.782
with some of the people you've healed.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.757
And then they'll bring you out
after the break.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.294
She says the emotional stuff
also plays well with her audience,

11:05.464 --> 11:08.433
so feel free to cry or...

11:08.734 --> 11:10.201
We'll see about that.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.132
They're also kind of curious
about the wedding.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.067
She'd love it if you answered
some questions.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.401
Let's keep the private life
private, okay?

11:16.575 --> 11:19.169
Nick! Nick, please wake up!

11:19.345 --> 11:22.644
Nick! Nick, please wake up!

11:25.818 --> 11:27.046
Jesus, that's Nick Crowley.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.716
Oh, my God. You're that 4400.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.449
The one with the hands.
Help him, please! Nick!

11:32.625 --> 11:34.217
Nick, wake up, please.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.473
- Is he all right?
- If you're okay, say something.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.350
Well, Jim Morrison says hello.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.019
Easy, easy, boys, easy.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.624
Coming up...

12:07.093 --> 12:09.220
You just saved Nick Crowley.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.523
On behalf of millions of rock 'n' roll
burnouts all over the world,

12:13.699 --> 12:15.166
allow me to thank you.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.935
Any time you wanna lay these on me,
you just let me know.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.571
It was a little bit big,
so I just had it resized.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.679
It's perfect now.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.343
I think Mom would be really happy,
don't you?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.687
Lily gave you that ring.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.617
I guess you can do
what you want with it.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.052
I think it's perfect.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.492
So have you thought about what
you're going to say at the wedding?

12:49.668 --> 12:52.569
Usually, the father of the bride
gives a toast.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.073
Well, it's all been so sudden.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.041
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.806
That's okay. I have a few thoughts.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.284
There's an article in this magazine
on toasts.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.711
Read it.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.882
I think I can handle that on my own.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.824
Dad, I want you to read it. Tonight.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.911
Hi.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.286
I bought some food.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.692
Let me help you with that.

13:47.860 --> 13:51.626
Thank you. My joints are a little stiff.

13:53.899 --> 13:58.393
Kevin, why did you put your hood up
when I came in?

14:00.472 --> 14:03.771
You shouldn't have to look at me
like this.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.143
Like what?

14:18.057 --> 14:21.356
Diana Skouris and Tom Baldwin
came by the bookstore today.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.753
They were asking about you.

14:23.929 --> 14:27.763
I figured Diana would be worried.
How did she look?

14:27.933 --> 14:30.094
Okay, I guess.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.098
A little sick.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.765
Kevin, I felt bad seeing her.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.431
I don't like what we're doing to her.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.976
- What I'm doing to her.
- I don't like it much either.

14:40.145 --> 14:43.512
But we are on the cusp

14:43.682 --> 14:47.379
of changing the world for the better.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.147
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.120
Kevin, it's already ugly.
Someone shot you yesterday.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.884
I know.

14:55.060 --> 14:59.759
But the experiment is worth the risk.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.661
They woke me up to do this.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.735
You woke me up to do this.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.034
I have to move forward.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.134
And to do that, I need Diana.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.979
And I need you.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.769
Is Shawn Farrell around?
I have something for him.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.139
I played that when we were recording
my first album.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.111
I've been holding on to it for years.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.910
You're really giving this to me?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.780
You saved my life.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.013
Seems like a fair trade to me.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.727
So this ability of yours.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.866
It works every time out of the gate?

16:08.434 --> 16:10.959
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, my God.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.400
I wish they'd brought you back
1 5 years ago.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.633
Career in rock 'n' roll...

16:16.809 --> 16:20.836
Sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.341
You lose a lot of people along the way.

16:24.183 --> 16:28.176
One day you look up,
and you're the last man standing.

16:29.021 --> 16:33.185
You should take better care
of yourself. I'm not always around.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.953
I feel like I owe you
more than a guitar.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.723
We're playing tomorrow night,
and I wanted to invite you backstage.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.995
You can hang out,
watch the show from the wings.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.658
- Really?
- Sure.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.101
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.399
If I keel over,
you can always come out

16:49.575 --> 16:52.408
and do your hands of God thing
for an encore.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.625
It's cold.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.964
You should bring your jacket.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.338
She didn't say anything
on the way over?

17:28.513 --> 17:33.417
Of course not, Kevin.
She hardly ever does.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.553
You're so brave.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.153
I always wanted to give it to you first.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.090
I thought you deserved an ability.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.822
I'm sorry it has to happen
without your permission.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.566
Can we get this started?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.636
Give Dr. Burkhoff your hand.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.420
Mommy, I'm gonna be late for school
if we don't leave soon.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.750
I'm sorry, baby.
I slept through my alarm.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.790
I'll be ready in a few--

18:16.395 --> 18:17.657
Mommy, are you okay?

18:17.830 --> 18:20.890
I'm fine. I just broke a nail is all.

18:34.513 --> 18:35.605
Hi.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.612
Hey, Marco.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.546
What are you doing down here?

18:40.719 --> 18:44.155
Tom asked me to check out
Dr. Burkhoff's computers.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.513
Are you okay?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.557
- I heard you had the flu.
- No.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.354
Hey, I thought you were taking
a sick day.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.020
Everyone, please, stop treating me
like a plague patient.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.426
I'm fine.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.760
Have we learned anything here?

18:55.934 --> 18:59.370
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean. Like, completely clean.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.507
I mean, there's no saved files,
no records of anything.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.232
It's like someone took out
his hard drives

19:04.409 --> 19:05.740
and swapped them for new ones.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.641
- So either he took them somewhere...
- Or someone else has them.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.247
Diana...

19:11.183 --> 19:12.741
...Iook at this.

19:13.285 --> 19:14.843
Is that Kevin?

19:17.222 --> 19:18.211
Yeah.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.551
My God, these are the side effects
of the injections?

19:20.726 --> 19:22.193
I haven't seen him in a couple
of weeks.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.589
I had no idea he'd gotten so bad.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.593
So who drew this?
You think it's a self-portrait?

19:25.764 --> 19:29.359
No way. Kevin's hands weren't
steady enough to make coffee.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.265
Didn't Tess like to draw?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.945
I feel like I'm in a staring contest.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.246
It's okay.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.390
I know it can be
a little awkward at first.

19:53.492 --> 19:57.121
So sometimes when I'm having trouble
getting started with a student,

19:57.296 --> 19:59.093
I'll take their hand.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.193
It helps everything get rolling.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.896
You up for it?

20:04.069 --> 20:06.333
Yeah. I guess.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.307
Just relax, okay?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.661
I'm sorry, l...

20:37.002 --> 20:39.562
To be honest,
I felt a little awkward.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.699
I haven't had someone touch me
like that since...

20:45.477 --> 20:47.809
...my wife passed.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.576
It's okay.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.514
Sometimes it takes more
than one session to make headway.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.252
Diana?

21:02.027 --> 21:03.085
Diana?

21:04.830 --> 21:07.094
Should I just call you a cab?
I can handle this if you want.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.291
No, I'm okay.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.628
Any sign of Tess?

21:10.802 --> 21:12.599
No, she hasn't come out yet.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.331
Look, Tom, I made an appointment
with the doctor tomorrow morning.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.806
But for now,
I'd just like to stick with it, okay?

21:20.979 --> 21:24.005
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.548
It's like I'm dragging myself around.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.511
Here she is.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.327
Come in.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.529
Hey.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.966
What?

21:43.368 --> 21:45.427
Different look for you.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.332
New look?

21:47.506 --> 21:50.339
I dressed like this for ten years.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.568
Hey, you're not here to ask
about the wedding, are you?

21:52.744 --> 21:56.043
I am officially taking the night off
from all planning.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.282
This has nothing to do
with the wedding,

21:58.450 --> 22:01.476
unless Nick Crowley's invited.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.745
He's downstairs.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.212
Really? I'm getting ready
for his show.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.654
Maybe he wants to give me a ride
or something.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.657
I don't think that's it.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.429
Well, what?

22:12.798 --> 22:15.824
I never get enough refills.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.230
I mean, look at me.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.568
- Where is he staying...?
- What's he saying?

22:23.742 --> 22:25.937
Nick has a prescription
for Antabuse.

22:26.111 --> 22:30.070
They're these pills that are supposed
to help him cut back on his drinking.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.513
He finally tried some.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.049
I guess he overdid it, huh?

22:34.219 --> 22:36.119
It's the same thing he does
with everything.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.382
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.555
Continue medicine for me.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.991
Do your worst.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.324
Please?

22:54.005 --> 22:58.374
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.306
Lay down. Lay down.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.477
You're my little lifeline.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.388
Kevin.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.290
Dr. Burkhoff,
I've been worried about you.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.296
What are you doing hiding up here?

23:55.534 --> 23:57.934
My God, look at you.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.163
Dr. Burkhoff,
you need to come with us.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.734
We're gonna get you some help.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.138
I can't do that.
People are trying to kill me.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.005
What people?
Who's trying to kill you?

24:07.179 --> 24:08.806
I think they work for the government.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.504
No, they don't work for NTAC.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.513
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm not.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.652
Listen, Kevin, you know us.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.414
If you come in, we'll protect you.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.316
Besides, I'm not taking no
for an answer. Come on.

24:20.492 --> 24:23.461
Actually, I think
you're going to have to.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.724
- Diana, what the hell are you doing?
- I don't know, Tom. I'm sorry.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.060
Diana is not quite herself right now.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.567
She'll do whatever Tess tells her to.

24:32.737 --> 24:35.570
Tess, would you get his gun, please?

24:52.424 --> 24:55.450
Please. I am so close to finishing.

24:55.627 --> 24:57.822
Stop trying to find me.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.057
I have no desire to hurt you.

25:05.203 --> 25:06.602
Diana.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.504
Are you okay? You all right?

25:11.076 --> 25:13.977
I don't know. What happened?

25:14.145 --> 25:16.375
You pulled your gun on me.

25:16.548 --> 25:19.016
- Tess.
- Yeah.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.119
- Oh, God.
- What?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.682
Something's wrong.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.790
I feel weird.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.222
Oh, my God. What are those?

25:29.594 --> 25:31.494
They're lesions.

25:31.663 --> 25:35.463
They're just like the ones Kevin had
when he started taking promicin.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.932
We need to get you to NTAC medical.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.944
We want him brought in unharmed.

25:48.113 --> 25:49.842
If there's anything at all
to these experiments

25:50.015 --> 25:51.346
Dr. Burkhoff has been conducting,

25:51.516 --> 25:53.848
a lot of people in D.C. are gonna
want to look over his notes.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.783
These pictures have already been
circulated to local law enforcement.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.855
We're gonna distribute them
around the neighborhood

25:59.024 --> 26:00.116
near Dr. Burkhoff's apartment

26:00.292 --> 26:02.123
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.852
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- So, what?

26:04.029 --> 26:06.156
We tell people there's some kind of
monster on the loose?

26:06.331 --> 26:08.891
No, if anyone asks, we tell them
Dr. Burkhoff has Werner's syndrome.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.160
- It's a rare wasting disease.
- Okay.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.770
You think we're gonna be able
to bring this guy in safe and sound?

26:13.939 --> 26:16.032
I mean, some cowboy cop
sees this stumbling towards him,

26:16.207 --> 26:18.505
you don't think he might shoot first
and ask questions later?

26:18.677 --> 26:20.611
That's why we have to get to him first.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.740
Whatever Dr. Burkhoff is guilty of,

26:22.914 --> 26:25.280
he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.917
Look, the good thing
about his condition

26:27.085 --> 26:29.246
is it shouldn't make him
too hard to spot.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.245
I don't know.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.618
They're nice hands,

26:33.792 --> 26:36.090
but they don't look magical
or anything.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.420
Making friends already?

26:38.597 --> 26:41.157
- Hey.
- Oh, you've chosen wisely.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.433
I speak from experience.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.661
The show was amazing.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.328
- Thank you so much for having me.
- What are you thanking me for?

26:48.506 --> 26:50.804
The show would have been canceled
if not for you.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.569
Listen, I just had the best idea
during the encore.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.771
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?

26:57.816 --> 26:58.840
And do what?

26:59.818 --> 27:04.778
Well, you could start with Mischa,
and work your way onward from there.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.450
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,

27:07.626 --> 27:10.459
but I kind of have a lot on my plate
here in Seattle, you know?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.221
I'm supposed to be
getting married soon.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.058
Well, in that case,
you have to come with us.

27:14.232 --> 27:18.396
It'll be like an extended bachelor party.
He'll take good care of you. Promise.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.232
And a promise from Mischa
is money in the bank.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.135
Besides, I like
having you along with us.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.471
You keep me limber.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.011
- You mean upright.
- Oh, yeah, that too.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.846
I don't...

27:31.016 --> 27:32.711
I'm not your personal physician,
you know?

27:32.884 --> 27:34.283
Of course you're not.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.818
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor I've ever met.

27:47.632 --> 27:50.863
Think about it, but not too long.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.503
What's to think about?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.536
Who could say no to all of this?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.752
So, what can I get you
this morning?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.162
Could I have the steak and eggs?

28:18.329 --> 28:20.957
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?

28:31.943 --> 28:32.932
Thanks.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.875
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner
in Beacon Hill. He's there right now.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.982
Bring him in quietly if you can,
but bring him in.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.735
Diana, wake up.

29:03.441 --> 29:05.238
Dr. Anapurn.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.004
I thought I was supposed to sleep.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.942
You gave me drugs.

29:10.115 --> 29:13.846
You're being discharged.
You need to come with me.

29:21.025 --> 29:24.153
I don't know. I guess he left
about 1 5 minutes ago.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.523
Did he say where he was headed?

29:25.697 --> 29:28.257
No. I mean, he didn't even touch
the food he ordered, right?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.765
He just left in a hurry.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.428
He left a good tip though.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.644
Where are we going?

29:45.116 --> 29:46.378
Thank you.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.212
You can go back to your office now.

29:50.822 --> 29:54.690
- Tess, don't do this.
- I'm sorry.

29:54.859 --> 29:58.124
I wish it didn't have to be you,
but there's no one else.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.132
We better go.
He'll be waiting for us.

30:09.874 --> 30:12.342
How could I have done that?
I don't remember any of it.

30:12.510 --> 30:15.308
Diana doesn't remember going
to Kevin's apartment at night either.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.380
If Dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,

30:17.549 --> 30:20.040
he must be getting desperate.
Feels like he's running out of time.

30:20.218 --> 30:21.446
He has to complete
the experiment.

30:21.619 --> 30:24.087
He's gonna up her dosage.
If we don't find Diana soon,

30:24.255 --> 30:26.917
she's gonna wind up
in the same shape as Kevin.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.058
I think it's the silence
that's messing us up.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.356
It's too awkward.

30:33.531 --> 30:37.763
So instead of us just staring
at each other, I thought we'll talk.

30:38.469 --> 30:39.527
Okay.

30:40.939 --> 30:42.873
Something specific
you want to talk about?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.108
No. You pick.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.605
Well, I've been thinking
about my parents a lot lately.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.841
What they'd think of all this.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.148
This place.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.847
Me.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.388
Sitting here trying to figure out
how to use my...

31:01.292 --> 31:02.850
Telekinetic ability?

31:03.995 --> 31:07.453
You know, you can say it out loud.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.399
Yeah, you can say that,

31:10.568 --> 31:13.731
but when I first got back,
I was a 4400,

31:13.905 --> 31:15.964
but I didn't have an ability.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.903
I felt normal.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.610
It was something I could hold onto.

31:21.346 --> 31:23.940
Now you have to get used to the idea
that you're special.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.017
Is that what my parents would think
if they were here?

31:27.185 --> 31:30.154
Or would they just think
that their son had become a freak?

31:34.058 --> 31:38.256
Richard, when you got taken,

31:38.429 --> 31:41.694
you were one of the first black pilots
in all of the military.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.265
You were at the vanguard.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.333
Now you're part of a different
vanguard.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.568
There's a reason they picked you.

31:51.175 --> 31:53.473
I think your parents would be proud.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.178
Yeah?

31:57.982 --> 31:58.971
Maybe that's true.

32:04.889 --> 32:06.413
Richard?

32:17.201 --> 32:19.863
Well, I guess that worked, huh?

32:35.386 --> 32:38.787
This will be fine.
We can work here for a while.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.016
Tell him he can go home.

32:41.192 --> 32:44.559
Please, you gotta help me.
Say something.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.026
Don't bother.

32:46.197 --> 32:49.098
He's not going to remember
any of this.

32:49.567 --> 32:52.536
Thank you. You can go home now.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.305
Kevin, can I get you some water?

32:57.642 --> 32:59.132
No.

32:59.310 --> 33:03.269
- I'm fine.
- Kevin, you're dying.

33:03.448 --> 33:07.475
You're killing yourself,
and now you're gonna kill me too.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.280
No.

33:10.855 --> 33:14.086
You will not die.

33:14.425 --> 33:18.156
My work is valid.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.626
Are you sure?

33:19.797 --> 33:22.061
Look at yourself.

33:22.233 --> 33:25.930
If it isn't working in me,
the fault isn't with the experiment.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.537
It's with me.

33:27.705 --> 33:32.233
All those years of shock treatments,
the fistfuls of medications.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.708
They must have changed me.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.038
I'm not a good subject.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.046
There is no good subject.

33:39.217 --> 33:42.243
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.

33:43.154 --> 33:46.954
You failed, and you're not thinking
clearly enough to see that.

33:49.160 --> 33:53.756
My mind is not compromised.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.922
We are at a point, Diana,

33:56.100 --> 33:59.331
where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.597
We have to be braver than that.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.539
And if necessary...

34:14.786 --> 34:17.380
...I'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.367
Working on a song?

34:30.534 --> 34:33.561
The end of one. Can't nail it though.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.299
Inspiration.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.475
What? Are you shocked
I'm drinking my lunch?

34:44.649 --> 34:47.117
- I didn't say anything.
- Good.

34:47.284 --> 34:49.047
- Because--
- Listen--

34:50.855 --> 34:54.484
This here is called
maintaining a base level.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.496
It's kind of scary, actually.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.192
Shawn, don't worry.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.497
I've made a solemn vow
not to overindulge,

35:08.673 --> 35:10.538
unless, of course, you're around.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.474
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.

35:16.981 --> 35:19.575
You're not going to be around,
is that it?

35:19.750 --> 35:22.344
You're not coming on the road?

35:23.921 --> 35:27.254
I wanted to. It's just...

35:27.625 --> 35:30.150
I mean, even if
it was for a little while.

35:30.828 --> 35:35.390
This gift I have, though,
it's kind of a responsibility, you know?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.429
And I don't mean to be harsh, man,

35:37.602 --> 35:40.867
but I don't think it was meant
to be used

35:41.038 --> 35:45.031
as a rock star's personal safety net.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.520
You don't know that.

35:59.657 --> 36:03.525
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive

36:03.694 --> 36:06.527
so I could finish my album.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.764
Nick, if you go down again...

36:14.405 --> 36:15.997
...I can't be there for you.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.605
There's still time, you know.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.746
We can save him.

36:55.913 --> 36:59.440
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in Kevin.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.312
He can do this.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.750
He's special,
that's why they had me wake him up.

37:04.922 --> 37:08.949
Tess, I packed an adrenaline shot
when we left the cabin.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.253
- Have you seen it?
- No.

37:12.129 --> 37:13.960
I need it.

37:14.599 --> 37:18.330
It has to be here in case I slip under.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.092
Kevin?

37:21.672 --> 37:24.436
I think I got stung by a bee.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.978
What is this?

37:37.154 --> 37:38.314
Don't move, Dr. Burkhoff!

37:38.489 --> 37:39.649
- Tess.
- There's nowhere to go.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.655
We've got this place surrounded.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.119
Nobody fires.

37:46.297 --> 37:47.730
He's not going anywhere.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.058
Hey, Diana. Are you all right?

37:49.233 --> 37:50.325
Tom.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.804
Hold still, Burkhoff.

38:01.579 --> 38:02.944
Put your hands up.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.352
Burkhoff!!

38:46.957 --> 38:49.289
They won't be able to hide for long.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.688
Tess will run out of meds.

38:50.861 --> 38:53.329
Dr. Burkhoff's not exactly
inconspicuous.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.590
They'll show themselves,
we'll find them.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.064
You mean we'll find Tess.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.800
Doesn't sound like Dr. Burkhoff's
gonna live out the week.

39:00.971 --> 39:01.960
I don't get it.

39:02.139 --> 39:04.073
He was supposed to be the father
of 4400 technology.

39:04.241 --> 39:05.401
That's why they woke him up.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.373
Well, that's just our theory.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.706
Maybe you're putting too much faith
in the future.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.085
Diana's okay?

39:16.721 --> 39:18.188
Yeah, she'll get there.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.756
She's down in NTAC medical.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.623
You got us a ride.

40:03.701 --> 40:06.101
Someone let me borrow them.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.716
Mr. Ryland wants a status report
on the promicin.

41:31.889 --> 41:34.153
We're good. Great, actually.

41:34.325 --> 41:38.125
We have enough of a stockpile
to last us for almost two years.
