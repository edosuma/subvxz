00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:18.660 --> 01:23.893
(Mickey) 'I'm not one given to quoting
Scousers unless absolutely necessary,

01:23.980 --> 01:25.698
'but as Cilla Black once said,

01:25.780 --> 01:30.012
'before she became a cross between
a pimp and a cheerleader on Blind Date,

01:30.100 --> 01:35.094
<i>"'What's it all about, Alfie?"'</i>

01:35.180 --> 01:37.375
They don't speak Latin,
they speak Spanish.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.893
No! Really?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.531
(Mickey) 'Scurrying around,
tryin' to suss it all out.

01:42.620 --> 01:47.250
'Truth, love... family.'

01:47.340 --> 01:49.410
Oi! Dickhead.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.495
(Mickey) 'Makes my 'ead hurt.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.499
'But in life, you have to play
the cards you're dealt.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.140
'Even if the cards are shite.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.450
'That was a metaphor - obviously.'

02:03.540 --> 02:07.613
The Great Escape with Steve McQueen
and James Garner.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.418
- He was a fine looking man.
- Charlie Bronson, you can't beat it.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.060
- I like the Rockford Files.
- That's not a war movie.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.212
Platoon? Hamburger Hill?
Full Metal Jacket?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.494
<i>The cattle are glowing...</i>

02:16.580 --> 02:19.094
- The cattle are not fucking glowing.
- What?

02:19.180 --> 02:21.899
- They're not glowing, they're lowing.
- What's lowing?

02:21.980 --> 02:23.698
- It's the sound cattle make.
- Play your cards.

02:23.780 --> 02:27.136
You thought it was,
"Our father who art in Heaven,

02:27.220 --> 02:29.017
"Howard by thy name," till you were 15.

02:29.100 --> 02:34.413
- Cows say moo.
- Not in the Bible. They low in the Bible.

02:34.500 --> 02:38.129
- Most of the Great Escape is lifted.
- It's a true story.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.176
And are you the movie police?
I can like any film I want.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.728
You're just in a bad mood cos
you've got the scabby Queen.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.538
No, I don't. I might be bluffing.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.493
Go for the one on the left, son.
You're safe with that.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.895
Fuck's sake! Fuck off!

03:02.140 --> 03:03.539
Sorry, can't hold it in.

03:03.620 --> 03:04.848
Oh, charming!

03:08.620 --> 03:09.814
Smile!

03:09.900 --> 03:11.618
Quit it!

CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS
(Woman) Bastard.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.969
Jesus Christ!

03:21.180 --> 03:23.011
Oh, my God, what's happened to her?

03:23.100 --> 03:25.614
Can you tell me your name?

03:27.220 --> 03:29.097
Call for an ambulance.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.528
And I peed on her...

03:31.620 --> 03:33.815
Wait, no. Let me.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.615
Ambulance, please.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.851
Yeah, I'm on Quarriers Lane,
Chatsworth.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.057
There's a girl, late teens, Asian.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.574
Looks to have been assaulted.
I'm a police officer.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.298
Hello?

03:48.380 --> 03:49.574
Battery's dead.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.934
I'll wait with you.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.135
No, you can't. You know that.

03:52.220 --> 03:56.179
Can you hear me?
Debs!

03:56.260 --> 03:58.171
I know. Just... Call me.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.176
Ah, Jesus.

It's been a week, you can't
just not talk to me forever!

04:29.300 --> 04:32.736
We live in the same house,
for God's sake!

04:32.820 --> 04:34.333
I'm sorry I'm going out
with the bloke you fancy.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.331
I don't fancy him.

04:36.420 --> 04:37.978
Didn't have you down
as the jealous type.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.779
Jealous? Of you and paedo plod?
Don't make me fucking laugh.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.613
What's going on?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.655
Nothing.

04:44.740 --> 04:45.809
(Both) Time of the month.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.414
What, both of yer?

04:48.500 --> 04:54.450
<i>Sisters, sisters</i>
<i>Never were there such devoted sisters</i>

04:54.540 --> 05:00.888
<i>Lord help the mister</i>
<i>That comes between me and my sister.</i>

05:00.980 --> 05:02.459
I love that.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.417
We're not sisters.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.615
Uh!

05:16.700 --> 05:18.292
(AII chant) Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:18.380 --> 05:20.018
Go! Go! Go!

05:20.100 --> 05:21.294
Ugh!

05:29.540 --> 05:31.178
(Monica) Morning, Norm!

05:31.260 --> 05:32.215
Aye.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.973
Overdo it a bit last night?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.413
Tastes like a camel shat in my mouth.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.058
Is that why you've got the hump?

05:38.140 --> 05:40.017
I made a joke!

05:40.100 --> 05:44.218
Hilarious. God,
I think I've got a bug workin' on us.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.779
Hasn't dented your
fashion sense, though.

05:45.860 --> 05:49.899
(Monica) Oh, nice. Can I borrow 'em?

05:49.980 --> 05:52.858
Like none of yous have
ever been pissed, eh!

05:58.100 --> 05:59.135
Good morning, Dad.

05:59.220 --> 06:03.293
Not if you've been sleeping in
a fucking wheelbarrow, it's not.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.895
Did she give a description?

06:16.980 --> 06:20.416
Nothing comprehensible
while I was around.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.175
By the time I gave my statement,
she was in with the doctors.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.818
'Definitely rape? '

06:25.900 --> 06:28.175
Yeah. They reckon she might
have had her drink spiked.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.171
Poor girl.

06:30.260 --> 06:34.776
I know, it's horrible. Anyway,
our officers are in with her again now.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.215
- I think my mum might know about us.
- How?

06:37.300 --> 06:40.133
I'm not sure. She was singing
a song about sisters.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.939
I'm surprised it's taken them
this long, to be honest.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.454
'Anyway, got to go, speak later.'

06:45.540 --> 06:46.973
OK.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.651
(Man) Thanks, love. See you next week.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.931
(Lillian) 'Eh! You can't just barge in!

07:06.060 --> 07:07.015
You're back?

07:08.860 --> 07:09.815
Evidently.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.492
When?

07:11.580 --> 07:13.252
A few days ago.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.171
Lillian kept me room open.

07:15.260 --> 07:20.129
Believe it or not, I've developed
an affection for this shithole.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.415
Sorry, love.
He just barged in like Gangbusters.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.129
That's all right, Lillian.
He were just leaving.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.176
I can handle meself, you know.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.654
- Did you plan to tell me?
- Why would I?

07:34.740 --> 07:36.731
- Us?
- There is no us, Shane.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.095
How many times do I need to say it?

07:39.180 --> 07:40.329
And that's it?

07:42.180 --> 07:45.092
You're a cold-hearted bitch.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.740
Wait.

07:56.180 --> 07:58.091
This belongs to your dad.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.018
Every sovereign is there.
Tell him I decided

08:02.100 --> 08:03.692
not to take him up on his offer.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.335
MUFFLED SPEECH

08:11.420 --> 08:14.139
(Shane) Fuck off.

08:14.540 --> 08:18.055
There you go. Working brunch
for the Good Samaritan.

08:18.140 --> 08:22.577
Cheers. I'm knackered.
Didn't get in till gone four.

08:22.660 --> 08:24.855
- Any more info?
- They wouldn't tell me anything.

08:24.940 --> 08:26.293
That's a bit weird, isn't it?

08:26.380 --> 08:29.895
I'd have thought you were their
blue-eyed boy, doing a shift off-duty?

08:29.980 --> 08:31.698
Professional courtesy.

08:31.780 --> 08:34.499
You did a good thing.
Get that down your neck.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.410
Tom O'Leary?

08:37.900 --> 08:41.859
You're under arrest on suspicion
of rape and grievous bodily harm.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.899
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

08:45.980 --> 08:47.652
if you do not mention when questioned

08:47.740 --> 08:49.696
something which you
later rely on in court.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.975
I'm sorry, pal.

08:53.780 --> 08:54.974
It's ridiculous! I was helping her!

08:55.060 --> 08:59.133
We know that, but the rape kit shows
that whoever did this used a condom,

08:59.220 --> 09:01.211
so there's no semen samples
to clear you.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.212
- And she identified you.
- She was drugged and barely conscious!

09:04.300 --> 09:06.256
Mine was just the first face she saw!

09:06.340 --> 09:09.173
- Where did you get them scratches?
- None of your business.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.012
Do you think I did this?

09:11.100 --> 09:14.092
Don't be stupid! Course not! But it would
help if you started givin' some answers,

09:14.180 --> 09:15.659
like what you were doing there
at that time of night?!

09:15.740 --> 09:17.537
I was getting some fresh air.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.818
I've done nothing wrong!

09:23.820 --> 09:25.776
Are you sure you don't want
a lawyer present?

09:25.860 --> 09:27.816
I don't need one.

09:33.620 --> 09:36.453
Serves him fucking right
if he's done it.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.258
We don't know that yet.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.691
What?

09:46.620 --> 09:49.498
Your...
Your boyfriend's been arrested.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.252
For rape.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.455
What?

09:52.540 --> 09:54.610
Asian girl.
Down Quarrier Lane last night.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.497
I know where...

09:56.580 --> 09:57.774
How do you all?

09:58.940 --> 10:00.612
You told 'em!

10:00.700 --> 10:04.739
Your mum overheard us arguing
last week. I never said a word!

10:04.820 --> 10:10.690
She didn't. I've done well keeping quiet
about it, considering how tense it's been.

10:10.780 --> 10:11.929
He didn't do anything.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.658
It's all over the estate.

10:13.740 --> 10:17.096
I was with him all night!
We were together when we found her.

10:26.060 --> 10:30.736
If I was of a particularly paranoid
disposition, this would bother me.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.617
You turfing me out?

10:32.700 --> 10:33.655
No.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.537
- You want me dole money?
- No.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.372
'Appy days.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.336
So...

10:42.420 --> 10:44.854
What you gonna do?

10:44.940 --> 10:47.818
I need to see him. I just...

10:47.900 --> 10:49.219
I'll tell 'em I was with him.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.009
Debs. Are you sleeping with him?

10:56.540 --> 10:58.610
You're gonna get him off
a rape charge

10:58.700 --> 11:01.897
by telling 'em he was busy sleeping
with an underaged girl at the time?

11:03.460 --> 11:05.337
Are you happy now?!

11:09.620 --> 11:11.053
She's shaggin' him?

11:27.900 --> 11:29.333
Ah, you slag!

11:32.060 --> 11:34.051
Oi, Fiona Bruce.

11:34.140 --> 11:37.257
When I asked you to stash
those dodgy MOT certificates

11:37.340 --> 11:41.413
in the toilet cistern,
you did seal the bag properly?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.615
Yeah, I think so.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.736
You think so?!

11:46.380 --> 11:50.134
It's usually much later in the day before
I wonder what I did to deserve you.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.049
Hair of the dog?

12:00.140 --> 12:03.177
Just a glass of water, thanks.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.457
Who was I drinking with last night?

12:06.540 --> 12:09.008
Anyone who'd have yer - apparently.

12:10.940 --> 12:16.731
(AII chant) Norma! Norma! Norma!
Norma! Norma! Norma! Norma!

12:19.700 --> 12:21.099
What was the occasion?

12:21.180 --> 12:23.330
There wasn't one.

12:23.420 --> 12:26.935
I just came in for a quiet half hour
to read the paper.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.456
Kinda got out of hand.
No-one in particular, then?

12:30.540 --> 12:32.019
Summat wrong?

12:38.020 --> 12:41.410
I woke up wearing
somebody else's trousers.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.013
And no pants.

12:44.660 --> 12:47.049
I've got no memory.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.539
How much do false MOT
certificates retail at?

12:51.620 --> 12:54.293
Enough to make it worth
my while flogging 'em.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.052
Enough to make it
a fucking embarrassment

12:56.140 --> 12:57.368
when I meet big Dessie Sanderson.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.257
I'll work it off.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.570
- Work?!
- It's only money, Dad.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.618
Why would you give Kelly
nigh on three grand?

13:07.700 --> 13:10.931
Not here, Shane, and not today.
I've had enough for today.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.217
She says she's rejected your offer.
What offer?

13:16.060 --> 13:18.051
So the tart's back in town?

13:18.140 --> 13:20.574
She's got balls, I'll give her that.

13:23.460 --> 13:28.534
I gave her a stipend to ease her path
out of here and away from you.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.778
Call it paternal concern.

13:31.860 --> 13:35.614
Who the fuck do you think you are!

13:35.700 --> 13:38.692
You'd better get that tone
out of your voice quick, sonny.

13:42.140 --> 13:45.530
You're a bully and a cunt!

13:45.620 --> 13:47.531
That's unacceptable.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.530
Dad. Dad!

13:51.660 --> 13:53.173
Mind your business.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.410
Think you're big enough
to take a pop at the old fella?

14:03.660 --> 14:05.298
You owe her an apology.

14:12.820 --> 14:14.492
- Dad, that's enough!
- No, it is not.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.856
Unless you're choosing sides.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.500
Stay out of it, Jamie.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.093
Got anything to add?

14:22.180 --> 14:23.295
Don't hurt my brother.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.531
"Don't hurt my brother".

14:26.620 --> 14:27.814
It's in his hands.

14:31.220 --> 14:36.010
SHOCKED MURMURS

14:39.820 --> 14:41.299
Leave it, fuck them!

14:41.380 --> 14:42.938
I'm ringing yer mam.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.453
And what would baby like today?
Left or right?

14:53.540 --> 14:56.100
Right one.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.455
(Mimi) Get out of my fuckin' way!

14:59.300 --> 15:01.416
- Move!
- What's going on?

15:01.500 --> 15:03.809
Paddy Maguire's knockin'
ten bells out of his lad!

15:03.900 --> 15:05.333
Shit!

15:06.460 --> 15:07.734
What about baby's lunch?

15:07.820 --> 15:11.017
Go to Tesco's,
like rest of t'country.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.890
Stay down! He'll kill yer!

15:21.900 --> 15:23.333
He's gonna have to.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.777
Patrick!

15:39.900 --> 15:40.969
Oh, my God!

15:42.060 --> 15:43.573
Fuck's sake, Dad!

15:53.780 --> 15:55.736
What are you fuckin' looking at?!

16:00.700 --> 16:02.497
He started it.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.491
Jesus! Shane!

16:10.260 --> 16:11.215
Bastard!!

16:20.820 --> 16:21.969
How many's that?

16:22.060 --> 16:23.698
14.

16:23.780 --> 16:26.897
And they say romance is dead.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.174
He didn't do this, you know.

16:29.300 --> 16:33.452
Of course he didn't.
But why is he being so evasive?

16:33.540 --> 16:36.134
His alibi's a load of rubbish.
Scratches on his neck.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.131
I don't know.

16:38.220 --> 16:39.812
We're his mates.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.490
- How is he?
- At the hospital with Kelly.

16:50.580 --> 16:51.615
Are they keeping 'im in?

16:51.700 --> 16:55.739
I dunno.
What are you up to?

16:55.820 --> 16:57.014
Just trying to get my 'ead round it.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.613
Shane?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.179
Debbie.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.372
You can't be mad at her.

17:03.460 --> 17:04.654
I'm not mad.

17:04.740 --> 17:08.130
What was all that about this morning?
The arguing?

17:08.220 --> 17:11.018
It's like she wants me
to be her best mate about it.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.294
Hardly likely, is it?

17:12.380 --> 17:16.214
She could probably use
a best mate right now.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.895
- It was really humiliating, lan.
- That's not Debbie's fault.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.858
I never said it was.

17:22.940 --> 17:25.579
My life's hardly a Mills and Boon
romance, though, is it?

17:25.660 --> 17:27.935
Try being queer in
the land that time forgot!

17:28.020 --> 17:32.650
How hard can it be? All I want
is a shot at a decent bloke.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.651
Me an' all.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.571
(Frank) Shit!

17:36.660 --> 17:38.298
Jesus Christ. What a pair!

17:38.380 --> 17:42.419
Oh, ha-ha fuckin' ha!
Least I'm not stood there

17:42.500 --> 17:45.537
with bromide in my brew,
withering on the vine.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.692
- We weren't laughing at you.
- Oh, weren't yer?

17:48.780 --> 17:51.248
It's always best to
get your blows in first.

17:51.340 --> 17:52.819
And who's withering on the vine?

17:52.900 --> 17:54.697
Evidence to suggest otherwise?

18:02.340 --> 18:04.092
Ah!

18:04.180 --> 18:06.489
Fuckin' hell, Ursula.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.697
And I swallow.

18:09.780 --> 18:12.169
Why are you taking
olive oil into school?

18:12.260 --> 18:15.491
Home eccy.
Has its other uses of course. Later.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.737
Honestly, Ursula, this has never happened
before! I fancy you like fuck.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.890
Tell that to your cock!

18:23.980 --> 18:25.971
I get hard-ons all the time,
you can hang a wet towel off it!

18:26.060 --> 18:27.812
A dry face cloth'd be a start.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.653
Wake up, you fucking idiot!

18:45.540 --> 18:48.498
Corrie's on. Let yourself out.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.812
- It's all I've got.
- We agreed on 80.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.492
I've got customers
waiting for their MOT.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.492
You'll get the rest
at the end of the week

19:10.580 --> 19:13.094
and a 20% discount on the order.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.536
How's your boy?

19:18.180 --> 19:21.729
Wiser, I'm hoping.
Not that it's any of your affair.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.773
Your missus must be fizzing.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.374
Wouldn't know,
I haven't spoken to her.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.939
I had to slap my lad down once.

19:30.020 --> 19:33.057
Mouthy little cunt.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.892
Walks with a permanent limp now.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.016
Mouth hanging down to one side.

19:40.140 --> 19:42.335
Let's leave the chit-chat
to Oprah, shall we?

19:43.940 --> 19:45.259
Always a pleasure.

19:45.340 --> 19:48.059
And it'll be 25% discount, Paddy.

19:55.740 --> 19:58.129
You know what your dad's like.

19:58.220 --> 20:01.098
He'll be really gutted about this,
feeling awful. But he won't back down.

20:01.180 --> 20:05.298
I'm finding it hard to consider
his feelings right now.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.098
It's how he's wired, you know that.

20:07.180 --> 20:10.252
That's not good enough, Mum.
How he's wired doesn't wash.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.252
The whole family's tiptoed round
his need to be a big man for years.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.889
So it shouldn't come
as any surprise, then, should it?!

20:18.100 --> 20:20.295
Maybe we have tiptoed round him,

20:20.380 --> 20:23.099
but everything he does,
he does for this family.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.659
Including wasting our Shane's face?

20:24.740 --> 20:29.052
It could only be an improvement,
though, battering Shane's face.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.692
Oh, shut up!

20:32.780 --> 20:34.611
It's what I do, innit?

20:34.700 --> 20:37.578
Lighten the load when everything
gets dead seri-arse.

20:41.420 --> 20:44.253
So what now?
You know he'll never apologise.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.978
I don't know, mam.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.573
He's crossed the line.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.818
Do you want a blow job?

20:54.900 --> 20:59.257
These stitches in me cock
might burst, you know?

20:59.340 --> 21:00.534
It still feels like...

21:00.620 --> 21:05.899
like there's a little, like,
shard of glass stuck in it or summat.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.257
What are you so happy about?

21:18.340 --> 21:20.934
- You lied to me.
- No, I didn't.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.419
- Yeah, you did.
- How?

21:22.500 --> 21:26.175
You said you came back
cos you had an affection for Chatsworth.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.455
You don't.

21:28.540 --> 21:29.734
And how the fuck would you know?

21:32.620 --> 21:36.693
You came back
because you love me.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.771
Do I fuck!

21:38.860 --> 21:40.691
You've taken one
too many bangs to the 'ead.

21:40.780 --> 21:44.455
It's all right, you don't have to
say it. Knowing it's enough.

21:44.540 --> 21:49.295
I don't know what fucking drugs
they gave you, but you can send

21:49.380 --> 21:51.098
some my way any time.

21:57.260 --> 21:59.137
OK.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.018
How could anyone develop
an affection for this place?

22:02.100 --> 22:05.775
It makes Basra seem like
Butlins in high season.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.976
It's not so bad.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.580
I'll just go to the station,
they don't have to know everything.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.258
The hotel room's on my credit card.

22:22.460 --> 22:25.338
They'll put two and two together.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.536
What's the worst that can happen?

22:27.620 --> 22:30.692
I won't have you testify.
They'll keep your name out of the papers

22:30.780 --> 22:33.294
but everyone round here will know -
your school.

22:33.380 --> 22:37.771
- I don't care who knows!
- I do. Shit sticks.

22:37.860 --> 22:39.578
You won't be Debbie any more...
You'II...

22:40.820 --> 22:44.017
You'll be the girl that was seduced
by that creepy copper.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.977
You're not creepy.

22:50.260 --> 22:53.855
I can take whatever consequences
come my way, but I'm not having

22:53.940 --> 22:55.658
a shadow cast over your life.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.371
The ID won't stand up in court

23:05.460 --> 23:08.497
because of the ketamine in her system.
Forensics on you will be minimal.

23:08.580 --> 23:12.539
There'll be some - from when
he put her in the recovery position.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.690
A couple of hairs on the clothes,
but not enough to convict.

23:14.780 --> 23:16.452
The girl put up a fight,
by all accounts.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.337
What if there's more
than a couple of hairs?

23:18.420 --> 23:21.378
- What if my DNA is all over her?
- How could it be?

23:24.700 --> 23:29.216
The 999 call was dialled from
a pay-as-you-go, so it's untraceable.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.779
Whose phone was it?

23:30.860 --> 23:33.613
- No-one's.
- Will you stop lying to us!

23:33.700 --> 23:35.179
- I'm not!
- Take it easy, Carrie.

23:35.260 --> 23:36.215
Who were you with?

23:36.300 --> 23:37.653
- None of your business.
- Who were you with?!

23:37.740 --> 23:38.775
My girlfriend!

23:38.860 --> 23:40.851
- Then get her to vouch for you.
- I can't!

23:40.940 --> 23:42.339
- You can!
- No!

23:42.420 --> 23:43.899
- Tom!
- I just... I can't!

23:43.980 --> 23:45.572
Stop lying to us!

23:45.660 --> 23:48.128
It's Debbie Gallagher!

23:48.220 --> 23:49.938
All right?

23:50.020 --> 23:50.975
It's Debbie Gallagher!

23:51.060 --> 23:54.848
- But she's...
- Underage, that's why I can't tell.

23:54.940 --> 23:57.454
My choices are between going
to jail and going to jail!

24:25.300 --> 24:28.736
Don't know why I bother.
Half these boxes are fuckin' empty.

24:28.820 --> 24:30.890
They've all gone digital anyway.

24:30.980 --> 24:33.733
MP3s, iPods, whatnot.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.692
Couldn't sleep?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.816
It's a very quiet house.

24:42.020 --> 24:44.818
- They didn't come home.
- No, I asked them, but...

24:50.180 --> 24:53.138
I didn't ask for it, Mimi.
The boy gave me no option.

24:53.220 --> 24:54.653
I know.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.850
This family means everything to me.

25:01.020 --> 25:04.490
I know that. But you've got
a reputation to protect.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.572
- I understand.
- But?

25:09.460 --> 25:10.973
No buts.

25:11.060 --> 25:12.732
You're my fella, Patrick.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.814
HE PANTS

25:34.460 --> 25:37.338
- Jesus! Norma!
- I need a word.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.978
Do these belong to you?

25:40.820 --> 25:43.015
Not unless
I've got multiple personalities,

25:43.100 --> 25:45.330
and one of them's an American tourist.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.251
Seen anybody in The Jockey
wearing them?

25:47.340 --> 25:49.331
I think I'd remember.

25:49.420 --> 25:51.934
Can I go now?

25:52.020 --> 25:54.170
Or do you want me to inspect
the rest of your wardrobe?

25:59.580 --> 26:02.048
They're not from my wardrobe!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.931
So what d'you think would happen?

26:10.020 --> 26:12.488
- When?
- When you give me dad's money.

26:15.620 --> 26:16.689
Not that.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.133
You knew there'd be trouble.

26:18.220 --> 26:23.248
Yeah, but for me, not you. I thought
he might come round, break my legs.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.978
Then at least we could get on with it.

26:27.060 --> 26:28.334
Get on with what?

26:30.380 --> 26:33.816
If you want me to say that soppy shite,
you'll have a long wait, Shane Maguire.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.697
I don't... I'm sorry.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.534
But I will take that blow job now,
if it's still on offer.

26:39.620 --> 26:41.212
You first.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.377
- Uh, uh-uh-uh.
- So?

26:44.460 --> 26:45.734
Suffer for your art.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.138
GIGGLES

26:56.780 --> 26:58.054
Get in.

27:13.540 --> 27:14.655
All right, Carl?

27:14.740 --> 27:16.219
Yeah, sweet.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.575
GIGGLING

27:20.540 --> 27:22.053
What's the fuckin' matter with you!

27:23.780 --> 27:24.815
Wake up.

27:26.620 --> 27:29.498
- This ever happen to you?
- No, mate, quite the opposite.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.459
I get a fucking flagpole
at the most inappropriate moments.

27:33.540 --> 27:36.134
You're a fit young lad, though,
so chances are it's not physical.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.176
Meaning what?

27:38.260 --> 27:42.890
Meaning, most impotency
has an underlying psychological cause.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.335
I'm too young to have
psychological problems.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.648
Your knob don't think so.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.379
- What's changed?
- Nothin'.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.451
Summat to put you off schoolies.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.053
How d'you know all this stuff?

28:00.140 --> 28:01.971
I read a lot about cocks.

28:03.940 --> 28:05.259
And fannies. Cocks and fannies.

28:05.340 --> 28:07.251
I'm heading out, I need to lock up.

28:07.340 --> 28:11.538
Just give us a minute, mate.
Bit light-headed, you know.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.252
What are you thinkin'?
You're a police officer!

28:20.340 --> 28:22.490
And I've known you
since you were a little kid.

28:22.580 --> 28:25.014
I like the pair of you, but...

28:25.100 --> 28:26.533
I suppose she scratched your neck.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.736
- A bit of a tiger, are we?
- Stop!

28:28.820 --> 28:30.856
- She'll have to come forward.
- No, she won't.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.010
She might not have to.
There's no witnesses,

28:33.100 --> 28:34.533
and forensics won't have enough...

28:34.620 --> 28:37.737
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

28:37.820 --> 28:39.617
I pissed on her.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.053
What?

28:41.140 --> 28:45.975
I pissed on her. It's how we found her.
I went for a leak in the bushes.

28:46.060 --> 28:48.779
My DNA's gonna be all over her.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.930
You pissed on a rape victim?!

28:51.020 --> 28:53.215
Well, it's not like I meant it.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.653
That's not gonna go down well in court.

28:54.740 --> 28:57.095
- She has to make a statement.
- No!

28:57.180 --> 29:00.217
You're prepared to let him
swing for this, are ya, Lolita?

29:00.300 --> 29:03.258
No, of course not.
I wanted to go straight to the CID.

29:03.340 --> 29:06.138
- Snare a copper between history and PE?
- Carrie.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.495
In your little mini micra,
and your big doe eyes?

29:08.580 --> 29:11.174
That's enough. Who the hell
are you to talk to her like that?

29:11.260 --> 29:12.852
Neither of you got secrets?

29:12.940 --> 29:15.852
What's the name
on your birth certificate, <i>Carrie?</i>

29:15.940 --> 29:19.091
How's your driving now you're
actually wearing your contacts?

29:19.180 --> 29:21.330
See, this is what I'm talking about.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.735
People will judge you, right or wrong.

29:33.620 --> 29:38.978
- It's just so complicated.
- Hm, well, you're an adult now, Debs,

29:39.060 --> 29:41.255
and this is what it's like.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.534
Have you told Dad yet?

29:42.620 --> 29:46.056
No, and I'm not sure you should either.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.859
I can't have everyone else knowing
and him not.

29:48.940 --> 29:53.775
It'll be different for him, Debbie, love,
cos you're his little princess.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.896
And, well,

29:55.980 --> 29:58.369
he might not take it so well.

29:58.460 --> 30:02.373
HE WAILS

30:02.460 --> 30:06.817
To tell you the truth,
I've been looking forward to this.

30:06.900 --> 30:10.859
You know, to this stage where
we're not just mother and daughter,

30:10.940 --> 30:12.532
but, you know...

30:12.620 --> 30:14.338
We're like mates.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.890
And, well, we can talk about stuff.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.096
I suppose.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.330
So...

30:22.420 --> 30:26.379
Does it bother you, you know,
your boyfriend liking young girls?

30:28.060 --> 30:30.574
What? No!

30:30.660 --> 30:34.209
Well, I mean, that girl you found,
she was only just 16.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.972
He never touched her.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.449
Well, that's not what the police think.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.292
I was with him!

30:41.900 --> 30:45.415
I'm only concerned because I love ya!

30:46.980 --> 30:48.857
Stroppy little cow.

30:49.260 --> 30:54.971
GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS
IN THE BACKGROUND

30:55.060 --> 30:57.449
You know when you go into
a supermarket on Christmas Eve, late,

30:57.540 --> 31:01.215
and there's only one scrawny turkey
left on the shelf that nobody wants?

31:01.300 --> 31:02.619
Yeah?

31:02.700 --> 31:05.009
Well, that's us, innit?

31:05.100 --> 31:08.331
THEY LAUGH

31:08.420 --> 31:10.172
How did it get to fuckin' this?

31:10.260 --> 31:12.649
I don't understand. I'm a big ride.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.454
I'm lost, lan.

31:25.220 --> 31:27.893
I know. Me an' all.

31:27.980 --> 31:30.653
What fuckin' use am I to Katie like this?

31:30.740 --> 31:33.334
That's the problem,
it's not just about Katie.

31:37.260 --> 31:40.536
It's about you as well. You need
to get on with your own life.

31:40.620 --> 31:45.057
And not take my frustrations out on
15-year-olds who think they're in love?

31:45.140 --> 31:46.493
Maybe she is.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.016
I'm a shit mate.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.773
No, you're not.

31:55.860 --> 31:58.249
You're brilliant.

32:08.540 --> 32:11.452
- I don't believe you.
- I've got collections to make.

32:11.540 --> 32:13.576
The fact that I fell out with him
don't mean business stops.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.616
How are you gonna make
collections like that?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.656
I'm a Maguire.

32:30.820 --> 32:32.936
- Ah!
- Wait, wait...

32:33.020 --> 32:35.773
- My hair's caught in your watch.
- Sorry.

32:35.860 --> 32:37.009
It's my turn.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.017
(Both) Oh!

32:40.100 --> 32:42.853
This is hopeless.

32:42.940 --> 32:46.091
You're not giving up, are you?
You've got a stiffy.

32:46.180 --> 32:49.889
I'm 19 years old.
I get an hard-on in a mild breeze.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.211
Thanks a bunch.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.212
It was a stupid idea anyway. I'm gay.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.417
Fuckin' a girl who is one of my best
mates is not gonna solve anything.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.060
- Wouldn't do any harm.
- Do you want a poof for a boyfriend?

33:02.140 --> 33:05.735
Anything that doesn't require batteries
to operate would be an improvement.

33:05.820 --> 33:09.130
Get back on your horse,
you miserable cow.

33:10.260 --> 33:13.696
A boyfriend with certain horse-like
qualities wouldn't go amiss.

33:15.980 --> 33:17.333
I'll do you a deal.

33:17.420 --> 33:21.857
If neither of us are settled down
by the time we're 40, I'll marry ya.

33:21.940 --> 33:24.329
35.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.694
Done.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.735
DOOR CLICKS OPEN

33:37.500 --> 33:39.730
So what's the plan?

33:39.820 --> 33:42.971
You gonna batter me or fuck me?

33:45.900 --> 33:48.937
I'm not into that Greek tragedy shite.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.776
We had a deal.

33:57.860 --> 33:59.612
No, you had a deal.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.090
My thoughts on the matter
weren't considered.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.569
You've caused a rift in my family.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.936
Weren't my fists were beating down
on me own son yesterday.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.897
You put him up to it, gave him the money.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.813
I didn't want kneecapped
as soon as you found out I was back.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.460
Could have given it to me direct.
Try again.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.054
He loves me.

34:21.139 --> 34:23.893
And you?

34:23.980 --> 34:26.447
I'm not into all that
silent treatment either.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.813
Do you love my son?

34:28.980 --> 34:31.255
Yes.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.411
So you deliberately provoked this?

34:34.500 --> 34:36.456
I didn't provoke it, you did...

34:36.540 --> 34:39.577
when you threw a pile of cash at me
and told me to leave.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.418
So it'll be my fault, then?

34:50.500 --> 34:53.889
I've got a wife who's back at home
who's ready to stand by me,

34:53.980 --> 34:56.540
despite the fact that
her heart's breaking.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.099
Those kids are her life.

35:01.660 --> 35:06.780
I can't be seen to back down
from a confrontation like that.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.930
Do you know what that
would mean to business?

35:09.020 --> 35:11.853
And what's Shane?

35:11.940 --> 35:13.134
Collateral damage?

35:20.540 --> 35:22.132
You fuck with him, I'll kill ya.

35:29.780 --> 35:30.735
DOOR SHUTS

35:39.740 --> 35:41.412
You're barred, Paddy.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.570
Don't be silly.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.093
- Dining out on it, are ya?
- No.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.169
That's enough, Dad.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.137
What is this,
Have A Go At Your Da' Week?

35:48.220 --> 35:50.780
People are here
for a peaceful drink, that's all.

35:50.860 --> 35:52.657
I'm not here to cause trouble.

35:54.340 --> 35:57.059
- I'm here to apologise.
- Yeah, well, Kelly's not here, is she?

35:57.140 --> 35:59.017
I've already paid her a visit.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.978
She says it's you
I should be apologising to.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.096
I'm asking your forgiveness.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.657
Please, son. I lost sight.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.499
It's breaking your mother's heart.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.334
And mine.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.693
Get up, Dad, for fuck's sake.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.377
I'm inviting you and Kelly,

36:34.460 --> 36:38.373
in fact all of yous, round for a meal
tomorrow night, family occasion.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.212
- I've got plans.
- Three-line whip. Look it up.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.733
You'll be there.

36:45.740 --> 36:46.695
All right.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.330
Well, off you pop and ask her.
See if she can get the night off work.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.335
That was big of you, Paddy.

37:04.380 --> 37:06.291
Everybody, on the floor.

37:16.660 --> 37:19.333
I expect you to acknowledge me
in the street.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.934
If you pass me, you'll say,
"Good morning,

37:22.020 --> 37:23.738
"good afternoon,
or good evening, Mr Maguire."

37:23.820 --> 37:26.288
Or "Paddy" if we're better acquainted.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.894
- Understood?
- (AIl) Yes, Mr Maguire.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.653
And if you're a purchaser of
controlled substances,

37:31.740 --> 37:34.015
you will go right on purchasing
as before

37:34.100 --> 37:37.376
and I will continue to provide the same
high quality of customer service

37:37.460 --> 37:39.610
that I always have.
Do I make myself clear?

37:39.700 --> 37:41.258
(AIl) Yes, Mr Maguire...

37:41.340 --> 37:43.058
(It's not loaded.)

37:43.140 --> 37:46.291
Get up, you tit! Right...

37:47.420 --> 37:50.810
Family meal, tomorrow night.
I'm cookin'.

37:54.780 --> 37:56.498
GUNSHOT

38:03.580 --> 38:04.808
Oops.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.295
Hiya. Given them a wash, have you?

38:19.380 --> 38:20.369
You?!

38:20.460 --> 38:22.769
Who'd you think it was, you daftie.

38:22.860 --> 38:26.216
But, I mean, how did?

38:26.300 --> 38:28.370
You and me, we didn't?

38:28.460 --> 38:31.896
Don't be soft. Don't you remember?
You came round to mine,

38:31.980 --> 38:36.417
demanding one of my girls service you,
said you were a woman with needs.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.695
But none of my girls
are that way inclined, love.

38:38.780 --> 38:40.008
How... How did I?

38:40.100 --> 38:43.695
Well, you wouldn't take no for an answer,
would you? Stripped right off.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.135
You said, "I'm a woman, hear me roar!"

38:46.220 --> 38:48.495
Whoo-hoo!

38:48.580 --> 38:51.731
When you passed out,
I couldn't get your jeans back on you.

38:51.820 --> 38:55.335
These were the next best thing.
So I dressed you,

38:55.420 --> 38:59.413
threw a bucket of water at you,
shoved you through the door.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.810
I don't know what to say, Lillian.
I'm so sorry.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.379
No, it were a laugh.

39:04.460 --> 39:09.898
One of the girls got it on camera.
Snatch Book - one of them websites.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.774
KNOCK ON DOOR

39:17.860 --> 39:19.134
Can I talk to ya?

39:23.860 --> 39:26.579
You need to stop seeing this bloke.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.571
Why?

39:28.660 --> 39:31.128
- It's not right.
- It's a bit hypocritical coming from you.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.733
I don't mean morally.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.139
I mean...

39:34.220 --> 39:38.133
Ursula Green wanted to give me
a blow job and I couldn't.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.450
- Why not?
- I just couldn't.

39:41.620 --> 39:46.057
I were trying to work out how come,
and Ursula's in your year at school.

39:46.140 --> 39:47.334
So?

39:47.420 --> 39:49.331
If you're shaggin',
it will make you the same as them.

39:49.420 --> 39:53.254
And I can't shag them because
they'll be the same as you.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.217
You're not makin' any sense.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.815
You're not like them!
You shouldn't be like that.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.130
All the lads talk about 'em,
compare notes.

40:01.220 --> 40:03.495
Who's got tongue rings and stuff.

40:03.580 --> 40:06.572
- You're better than that.
- I'm not better than anyone.

40:06.660 --> 40:07.729
You are.

40:07.820 --> 40:11.096
You're better than all of us -
me, Lip, lan.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.772
You're the good one, Debbie.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.533
You can do anything you want,
be anything you want.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.417
I'm still gonna do all that stuff.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.092
What if you get pregnant or something?

40:19.180 --> 40:22.058
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
I'm not stupid.

40:22.140 --> 40:25.815
I'm happy, Carl.
Why can't you just be happy for me?

40:27.140 --> 40:32.134
Well, you should, because happiness
is at a premium these days.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.778
You know?

40:33.860 --> 40:38.012
What, about your boyfriend? Of course
I know. I've got ears, haven't I?

40:40.420 --> 40:43.139
Carl, will you give us a minute?

40:46.380 --> 40:48.769
Ursula, it's Carl... Gallagher.

40:48.860 --> 40:50.213
Why didn't you say anything?

40:50.300 --> 40:52.495
I was waiting for you to tell me.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.337
I was scared.
I didn't know how you'd react.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.058
What, you think I'd ground you?

41:00.140 --> 41:04.770
Scrape the rust off the chastity belt
and throw away the key?

41:04.860 --> 41:06.259
No.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.816
I am your father, Debbie.

41:22.620 --> 41:25.692
There's nothing you can't tell me.

41:25.780 --> 41:29.409
Nothing you could do
will ever stop me loving you.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.737
I'd give you some, kid,
but, you know, you're underage.

42:04.660 --> 42:06.252
What you doin'?

42:06.340 --> 42:09.491
Leaving.
I'm the common denominator here.

42:09.580 --> 42:11.332
If I go everyone's,
problems will be solved.

42:11.420 --> 42:12.375
You can't!

42:12.460 --> 42:14.496
No?

42:14.580 --> 42:16.298
I can't put Debbie through this.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.813
I won't.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.458
I care too much about her.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.371
(Stan) Tom!

42:21.460 --> 42:24.054
I've still got friends in Ireland.
I can disappear there.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.051
The DNA results came back.

42:26.140 --> 42:29.530
The skin samples from under
her fingernails - they've got a match.

42:29.620 --> 42:32.054
It's some bloke on the other side of
the city, a three-times sex offender.

42:32.140 --> 42:34.779
(Stan) They made an arrest
this afternoon.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.691
Fuck off!

42:40.180 --> 42:41.374
How's the girl?

42:41.460 --> 42:43.132
Still under sedation.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.780
She's traumatised, Tom.
You can't blame her.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.657
I don't.

42:47.740 --> 42:48.934
Not for a minute.

43:06.540 --> 43:07.973
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

43:08.060 --> 43:11.370
(Indian accent) All right,
lamb tikka masala...

43:11.460 --> 43:15.578
(Normal voice)... from an old recipe
of my dear departed mother.

43:15.660 --> 43:18.128
Guests first.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.899
Kelly's vegetarian, Dad.

43:21.980 --> 43:23.857
Oh.

43:23.940 --> 43:25.771
So your body's a temple, is it?

43:27.900 --> 43:31.097
In terms of animal products, yeah.

43:31.180 --> 43:35.219
In terms of spunk, I'm tested regular,
so no worries on that front.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.139
- Cheese on toast do you, love?
- That'd be great.

43:40.740 --> 43:43.732
Could I have that an' all?

44:02.420 --> 44:07.494
Right, so, how did you two meet?
I want to hear all about it.

44:07.580 --> 44:09.571
Tom took her for her cycling
proficiency test at school.

44:09.660 --> 44:11.093
No, he didn't!

44:13.300 --> 44:15.370
As a matter of fact, I asked him out.

44:16.540 --> 44:17.973
Right.

44:18.060 --> 44:21.052
And have you always been interested
in girls much younger than yourself?

44:22.180 --> 44:26.571
No. No, no,
this is a one-off circumstance.

44:26.660 --> 44:29.458
- Ignore her, she's just stirring it.
- I am not!

44:29.540 --> 44:31.451
Yes, you are!

44:33.260 --> 44:36.172
So, what's it like... giving birth?

44:36.260 --> 44:41.493
It must be one of the most wondrous
things a person can experience.

44:41.580 --> 44:43.093
Hm.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.374
SNIGGERING

44:44.460 --> 44:48.851
Well, if you're a fella,
imagine shitting a football,

44:48.940 --> 44:51.090
or trying to pull your lip
over the top of your head,

44:51.180 --> 44:54.490
because that's about
the closest I can describe it.

44:54.580 --> 44:58.573
- What's the occasion again?
- Meeting Debbie's fella.

44:59.700 --> 45:00.815
Oh, yeah!

45:00.900 --> 45:03.539
So come on.

45:06.900 --> 45:10.415
- When this country meant something...
- Fuck's sake.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.570
- Shall we clear away now?
- Yeah.

45:12.660 --> 45:13.979
- Aye.
- Yep.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.778
FRANK RAMBLES

45:15.860 --> 45:21.571
...and Major and Thatcher...
- (Norma) Mon. Mon, is there no pud?

45:21.660 --> 45:24.049
- We're not having pudding tonight.
- Debbie's arranged a screening.

45:24.140 --> 45:26.449
Oh, aye? What of?

45:26.540 --> 45:29.134
It's on the computer. It's only short.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.973
Snatch Book clips.
Only last a couple of minute.

45:39.100 --> 45:40.658
Fucking no! Please wait!

45:40.740 --> 45:42.173
No, please!

45:42.260 --> 45:45.650
Was it Natalie Wood
was in The Searchers?

45:45.740 --> 45:49.050
Oh, yeah, and she was drop dead
gorgeous in that an' all. Phwoar!

45:49.140 --> 45:51.654
I always wanted to be like that.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.494
Tracking down Indians, I mean.

46:00.460 --> 46:03.418
Little Big Man - that was brilliant.
Dustin Hoffman - a god!

46:04.740 --> 46:08.289
<i>Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'</i>
<i>Keep movin', movin', movin'...</i>

46:08.380 --> 46:12.055
- (Mickey) 'I believe in love, Alfie.'
- <i>Keep those doggies movin'...</i>

46:12.140 --> 46:15.177
- 'Without true love, we just exist.'
- <i>Rawhide</i>

46:15.260 --> 46:19.333
<i>Don't try to understand 'em</i>
<i>Just rope and throw and brand 'em...</i>

46:19.420 --> 46:26.292
(AIl) <i>Soon we'll be livin' high and wide</i>
<i>My heart's calculatin'...</i>

46:26.380 --> 46:29.258
'Cilla Black is underestimated
as a philosopher.

46:29.340 --> 46:34.289
'People talk about Bob Dylan
and that, but he just fuckin' moans!

46:34.380 --> 46:37.178
'Cilla had summat to say.

46:37.260 --> 46:40.377
'AIways had legs like toothpicks, though.

46:40.460 --> 46:44.738
'Well, then again, I suppose
most Scousers are undernourished.'

46:44.820 --> 46:48.608
Yee-haa!

46:48.700 --> 46:50.019
(AIl) Rawhide!

46:50.100 --> 46:52.216
LAUGHTER

47:32.300 --> 47:35.053
Come on, open the door! Let us in!

47:35.140 --> 47:37.449
CHEERING

47:37.540 --> 47:41.215
If that's her bikini line, she must wear
Bermuda shorts to the beach!

47:41.300 --> 47:43.052
Got nice tits, though.

47:43.140 --> 47:49.454
LAUGHTER

47:49.540 --> 47:53.294
- Norma Starkey!
- Sexy mama!
