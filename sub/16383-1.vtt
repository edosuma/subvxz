18:11.458 --> 18:12.625
ALL: The wanderer

18:12.625 --> 18:13.793
Hey, hey, the wanderer

18:13.793 --> 18:17.264
Roam around and round
and round and round

18:17.264 --> 18:19.632
Round and round
and round and round

18:19.632 --> 18:21.334
CHU: Hey, boss.
You kill me.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.336
RUDY: You are my idol,
Mr. Fountain. My idol.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.773
(ALL CHEERING)

18:26.773 --> 18:30.177
I'm so happy
to meet you.
I love your singing.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.444
Do you have an album out?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.914
You wouldn't be just
saying that to butter
me up, would you?

18:34.914 --> 18:37.450
Because I detest hypocrisy.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.453
No, I...

18:40.453 --> 18:44.391
Oh, Chu. (SNIFFING)
There's a fish in here.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.459
Get rid of it.
CHU: You got it, boss.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.595
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, turn loose of me.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.930
You know,
in a fit of nostalgia,

18:50.930 --> 18:54.367
I was going to shoot
you myself, but I hate
being so hands on.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.902
And I hate
stoolies even more.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.504
Stoolie? I'm no stoolie.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.206
I never said
a word to McKenna.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.540
Are you kidding me?

19:00.540 --> 19:03.610
You really think
that I don't know why
they let you go so fast.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.312
QUINTERO:
You got it all wrong.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.215
Hey...

19:08.215 --> 19:09.349
(MUFFLED YELLING)

19:09.349 --> 19:11.618
What a waste of
a good chicken leg.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.190
Relax.
You'll get indigestion.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.493
You're gonna love this.
I'm gonna take you all
the way back to 1961.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.865
(SINGING) Splish, splash
I was taking a bath

19:25.865 --> 19:28.635
All about a Saturday night

19:28.635 --> 19:30.237
(BOTH VOCALIZING)

19:31.804 --> 19:34.741
Rub a dub
I jumped back in the tub

19:38.378 --> 19:39.846
Bobo delivers the euphoria.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.516
10:30 Thursday morning.
That's a hundred grand.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.919
Did your cop friends
get that, Quintero? Huh?

19:46.919 --> 19:49.389
Was it loud enough
for you? Huh?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.762
FOUNTAIN: What?
You can't swim?

19:59.232 --> 20:02.569
CHU: Hey, Quintero,
I hope you got your
flippers on.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.309
I hope
your suit is drip-dry.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.477
(SPLASHING)

20:10.910 --> 20:12.312
(CLANGING)

20:13.280 --> 20:15.548
Relax. Probably the pigeons.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.916
I'll take care of it.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.792
FOUNTAIN: Oh, no.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.226
RUDY: I'm coming, boss.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.330
We'll take care of this,
Mr. Fountain.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.266
You really think
that's gonna work?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.634
No, boss. I'm stupid.

20:36.603 --> 20:40.507
Just once I would
like to conduct business
in a hygienic environment.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.008
ALL: Yes, boss.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.288
DEBRA: Come on, McKenna.
You gotta give me something.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.656
NICK: I haven't
got anything, Debra.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.925
I just got here,
for crying out loud.
Give me a break, will you?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.960
Hey, I found
him for you.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.295
Quintero?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.364
So much for the
scum floats theory.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
He was my only lead.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.667
Hey, relax.
We got a witness.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.502
You got a witness?
Yes, sir.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.937
Where is he?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.672
Fella's right over here.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.808
Where?

21:15.808 --> 21:17.043
McPHAIL: Uh, Nick?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.077
Yeah?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.913
Over here. He's been
asking for you all night.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.551
Hi!

21:24.551 --> 21:26.486
Hi.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.288
I'm Devon Butler.
You can just call me Devon.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.024
Ready for fingerprinting?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.761
Let me talk to you a minute.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.097
You got any idea
what a sharp lawyer

21:38.097 --> 21:40.633
will do to a kid
on a witness stand?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.802
I mean, he will rip
this little guy to shreds.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.971
He won't
know the killer
from Captain Kangaroo.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.439
What are you
trying to do to me?

21:46.439 --> 21:47.640
Nick, he's all we got.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.908
What's up?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.549
Little boy.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.952
If you saw
the bad man again,
would you recognize him?

21:59.952 --> 22:04.457
Don't you think
a formal interrogation
downtown is in order?

22:04.457 --> 22:07.960
And Captain Kangaroo
hasn't been on the air
for nine years.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.965
God hates me.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.601
Get his parents,
get him downtown.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.038
NICK: Who are you?

22:19.038 --> 22:21.874
I'm Devon Butler.
I just told you
back there.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.576
Short memory!

22:39.459 --> 22:40.560
(LAUGHING)

22:40.560 --> 22:42.462
Look at that fat jumbo.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.763
(LAUGHING)

22:52.405 --> 22:56.876
Do you recognize
anybody in the book?

22:56.876 --> 22:59.779
You have any pictures of
these guys from the back?

23:00.980 --> 23:03.450
I don't think
I like that question. Why?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.687
That's the way I saw them.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.434
Let me explain
something to you,
all right?

23:21.434 --> 23:25.772
You see, my strong
suit is not patience.

23:26.973 --> 23:30.109
So what I want you to do
is to look at the book there

23:30.109 --> 23:32.845
and find someone
that you recognize.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.747
Otherwise, I'm going to
rip your little head off.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.048
McPHAIL: Nick!

23:36.048 --> 23:37.450
I got a plate number.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.452
Son, why didn't you
tell us that before?

23:40.787 --> 23:42.922
Anybody ever heard
of quid pro quo?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.658
One hand washes the other.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.495
That's bonus information.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.907
You'd like a popsicle?

24:00.907 --> 24:04.611
No, I don't
want no popsicle.
I want to see your superior.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.849
Hello, Devon.
My name is Captain Rubio.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.554
I understand
from Detective McKenna
that you wanted to see me.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.989
You need me to testify
and identify, right?

24:16.989 --> 24:19.659
Yes, Devon, that
would be very helpful.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.629
Ma'am, I'd like to cut a deal.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.634
RUBIO: He wants to be a cop.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.702
What?

24:29.702 --> 24:33.806
Shield, assignments,
squad car, the works.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.842
And he's not going to
help us unless he gets it.

24:35.842 --> 24:40.613
Bring the
criminal back
when you arrest him.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.850
Don't go...
Don't go let him eat.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.852
Just bring him to jail.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.521
Bring him to jail!

24:48.521 --> 24:51.157
Yeah, well,
give me five minutes
with him alone.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.492
Hey, um...

24:54.126 --> 24:56.395
So, anybody
want a sip?

25:00.232 --> 25:01.801
Guess not.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.770
(DEVON HUMMING)

25:05.705 --> 25:08.575
Devon, sweetie,

25:08.575 --> 25:12.178
why don't you
just go ahead and
give us that plate number?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.046
Then we can all go home.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.815
Okay.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.249
Make me a cop.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.652
Why do you wanna be a cop?

25:19.652 --> 25:20.887
Look at this guy.

25:20.887 --> 25:24.724
Raggedy-ass clothes,
20-year-old car.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.860
Bad back, bad marriage,
bad attitude.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.597
Son, does that sound like
any kind of life for anybody?

25:30.597 --> 25:33.833
But if you were a cop,
people don't sass you.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.735
Give us the plate number!

25:35.735 --> 25:36.869
Nick!

25:44.010 --> 25:45.344
I'll tell you what.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.847
I'll give you
a little taste
of what I got.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.850
"A taste"!
Where does he
get this stuff?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.719
Prime time.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.989
There's a shipment
of euphoria coming in.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.659
Tell us something
we don't know.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.228
Thursday. 10:30.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.065
Mmm-hmm.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.166
Where?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.001
Don't know.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.770
But I got a name.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.579
Why is everyone
gathering around me?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.052
What's the name?

26:26.052 --> 26:27.954
I really want to
give you this name.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.021
Uh-huh.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.658
You put me on duty,
it's yours.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.663
Hey, McPhail,
I'm from outer space.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.197
Listen, you've
had ride-alongs
before, Nick.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.732
No, I don't have ride-alongs.
Yes, you have.

26:39.732 --> 26:40.700
No, I don't.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.735
Yes, I want you to
take him for eight hours.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.070
Other guys have
ride-alongs.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.939
Put a sock in it, Nick!

26:46.939 --> 26:50.142
I want you to drive him
around for eight hours.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.978
Let him hit the siren
a couple of times.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.846
Humor him. What is
the problem with this?

26:53.846 --> 26:55.381
I can't. I don't
get along with kids.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.916
I don't like them.
They don't like me.
I don't care.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.217
Nobody cares.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.052
You can't have
any fun with a kid.
You take a kid to a bar,

27:00.052 --> 27:01.721
he has one drink,
he falls off the stool.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.022
What is with you?
What? What?

27:03.022 --> 27:04.891
You gave me such
a wonderful present today.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.893
You gave me
two destroyed lawns,

27:06.893 --> 27:08.661
a weather grill,
a chaise lounge.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.062
I gave you a perp.
A reckless endangerment.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.764
You owe me.
I don't owe you nothing.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.065
You owe me.
I don't owe you nothing.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.400
Hey, Nick,
when you get home,

27:14.400 --> 27:16.936
you want to check and
just see how the blues fit.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.105
Are they a little
snug under the...
You know.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.372
(BANGING)

27:23.409 --> 27:24.744
McPHAIL: Hello,
I'm Detective...

27:24.744 --> 27:25.945
Oh, baby.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.347
Oh, baby.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.218
I told them not to call.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.053
Oh, you had me
scared to death.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.789
Mrs. Baldwin.
Hi, I'm Captain Rubio.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.057
We spoke before.
Yes, yes.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.826
As I explained,
young Devon here

27:39.826 --> 27:41.761
witnessed a murder
earlier this evening.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.395
Fortunately,
he wasn't harmed.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.997
They're gonna
let me be a cop.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.066
What Devon means
is we're just gonna

27:47.066 --> 27:49.268
have one of our men
ride him around
for a few hours.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.037
You know,
sort of as a reward.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.305
It's quid pro quo
for helping them out.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.743
My grandson
has seen all I want him
to see of police work.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is going to be
nothing dangerous.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.149
He's gonna be riding
with our department's
most decorated man.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.251
NICK: All right, Devon.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.820
You ride around
with me for eight hours.

28:07.820 --> 28:11.490
If you so much as think
about getting in my way,

28:11.490 --> 28:14.060
I'm gonna tie your
little ass to the axle

28:14.060 --> 28:16.796
and drag you
all over the
city. Okay?

28:16.796 --> 28:18.297
RUBIO: Nick?
Hmm?

28:18.297 --> 28:21.167
I'd like you to meet
Devon's grandmother.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.336
How do you do?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.472
No, no, please.
Don't bother
with introductions.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.908
We're leaving.

28:28.908 --> 28:32.511
And you talk to my grandson
again like that and
you'll be wearing that axle.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.081
Grandma, I'll be
serving our community.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.482
Taking responsibility.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.217
Now, where'd you get that?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.819
From you.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.453
Well...
Thank you!

28:42.254 --> 28:44.023
Now I didn't say yes.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.758
But you said, "Well."

28:45.758 --> 28:48.127
And you always
say "Well" before
you say yes.

28:49.161 --> 28:53.232
Well, uh...
No, we need to
discuss this some more.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.937
That's sharp, Nick.

28:57.937 --> 29:03.142
(SINGING) Remember
when I first met you

29:03.142 --> 29:04.410
Wish me luck.

29:05.444 --> 29:11.017
The heavens in my heart

29:11.017 --> 29:13.185
Leaped into your eyes

29:13.185 --> 29:14.987
(KNOCKING ON GLASS)

29:19.125 --> 29:20.960
You're amazing.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.428
You really think so, huh?

29:24.463 --> 29:25.798
This better be good.

29:27.366 --> 29:30.136
CHU: Well, sir,
they got a witness.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.306
And what did this
witness witness?

29:34.306 --> 29:36.042
It's just some kid.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.309

where he lives.

once myself.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.788

you can about this kid.

Nice pair
of boots, Nick.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.466
I'll have to get me
a pair of those.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.036
So what kind of hardware
do you carry?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.372
I carry a bazooka
in the trunk.

could I please
get your attention.

you take care of McKenna.

Here you are.
Now get in the car.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.849
I always wanted one of these.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.319
Get in the car.

Yes?

A cop's gotta have cuffs.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.096
He's right, McKenna.

this job worth doing.

at the range

right out of them?

that for years.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.771
Why do you think
I do that?

I do that because
I don't want to
chase anybody.

43:19.798 --> 43:23.201
You know, police business.
Do you understand? Come on.

43:23.635 --> 43:24.903
I guess.

43:25.804 --> 43:27.739
So what do you
want to do?

43:27.739 --> 43:28.940
Let's go have a Ding Dong.

43:33.979 --> 43:36.715
Hey, Ray, stop! Look!

43:36.715 --> 43:39.084
The black Lincoln.
Get over here.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.921
They know
our neighborhood.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.055
Who does?

43:44.055 --> 43:45.423
They want me. Not you.

43:45.423 --> 43:47.392
Here, keep this in
the evidence locker.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.994
I'll take care of it.

43:48.994 --> 43:51.029
Now turn around and
walk out of here
naturally.

43:52.898 --> 43:54.332
Naturally.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.337
Hey! How you doing,
fart-head?

43:59.337 --> 44:02.340
Mr. Big Shot
with the cops, huh?

44:02.340 --> 44:05.010
Don't you morons have
anything else to do?

44:07.445 --> 44:08.947
What did you do that for?

44:08.947 --> 44:10.782
'Cause you called me a moron.

44:10.782 --> 44:14.152
So throwing your jacket on
the ground makes you smarter?

44:14.152 --> 44:16.121
This kid's
making me nuts.

44:18.289 --> 44:21.292
Hey, guys.
I can't kid around anymore.

44:21.292 --> 44:23.061
I'm watching my grandma's car.

44:23.061 --> 44:26.164
Oh! So you're
here with Grandma?

44:26.164 --> 44:27.298
Mmm-hmm.

44:27.298 --> 44:29.868
Oh, so this is
Grandmommy's car, huh?

44:30.168 --> 44:31.937
Guys, please.

44:31.937 --> 44:34.405
Bust me up, but
not the car. Please.

44:34.405 --> 44:36.207
You mean,
don't do this?

44:38.243 --> 44:40.278
That's exactly what I mean.

44:40.278 --> 44:41.412
Or this?

44:41.412 --> 44:43.081
Oh, too bad.

44:43.882 --> 44:45.016
McNALLY: My turn.

44:45.851 --> 44:48.086
This is your kiss goodbye.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.261
(EXCLAIMING)

44:56.828 --> 44:57.996
What are you doing?

44:57.996 --> 44:59.397
Get out of here, boy.

44:59.397 --> 45:01.399
I'll break your face
when I get you!

45:01.399 --> 45:02.901
Punks that you are!

45:02.901 --> 45:05.470
We'll get you,
you stupid little brats!

45:05.470 --> 45:07.739
Let's get
back in the car.
Come on, let's go.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.842
Ah, look at this.
Oh, man!

45:10.842 --> 45:13.111
These punks got
no respect nowadays.
Get in the car.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.348
Hi, Grandma.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.986
It finally
caught up with you.

45:20.986 --> 45:21.953
What did?

45:21.953 --> 45:25.090
The new school counselor
is here to see you.

45:25.090 --> 45:28.026
I hope you're happy.
Just answer everything.

45:28.026 --> 45:29.360
Truthfully.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.534
There you are. Hi, Devon.

45:36.534 --> 45:37.869
Hi.

45:40.005 --> 45:41.773
You recognize me?

45:42.908 --> 45:43.909
No.

45:46.511 --> 45:49.314
I'm Mr. Goodman, the
new counselor from school.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.252
You haven't seen me
around school, huh?

45:55.053 --> 45:56.154
No.

45:57.155 --> 45:59.490
Well, let's sit down.

46:00.892 --> 46:02.093
So...

46:03.028 --> 46:04.863
You know why I'm here?

46:04.863 --> 46:06.898
Missing school today?

46:06.898 --> 46:08.299
Exactly.

46:08.299 --> 46:10.168
Now, your grandmother
tells me that you've been

46:10.168 --> 46:13.004
helping the police
find a very dangerous man.

46:13.004 --> 46:15.506
You won't believe
the dirtbags we're...

46:20.445 --> 46:22.513
Hello? Devon?

46:23.081 --> 46:24.850
You were saying?

46:26.952 --> 46:30.989
I said I didn't see
him. I didn't see
the bad guy's face.

46:31.923 --> 46:34.359
That's good.
I mean, that's bad.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.462
Probably, the police
are disappointed.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.264
Oh, very disappointed.

46:39.264 --> 46:42.033
And mad, too,
because I wasted their time.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.501
(SCOFFS)

46:43.501 --> 46:45.937
I'm afraid
we're out of cream.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.874
Oh, gee.
You know what?

46:48.874 --> 46:51.877
I'm gonna take
a rain check on this
because I've got...

46:51.877 --> 46:53.311
Ooh. I think
I will take
one of these.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.446
I've got
a few stops
I have to make.

46:57.983 --> 46:59.384
Is everything all right?

46:59.918 --> 47:01.386
Oh!

47:01.386 --> 47:03.188
I'm very pleased
with Devon.

47:03.588 --> 47:05.223
As a matter of fact,

47:06.491 --> 47:08.226
Devon's a good boy.

47:16.401 --> 47:18.136
You have a good day.

47:20.438 --> 47:21.973
(SHOUTING) Grandma!

47:26.377 --> 47:28.914
Hey, mister.
(WHISPERS) Damn.

47:28.914 --> 47:30.115
Come here.

47:30.115 --> 47:32.583
What? Excuse me,
madam? Come here?

47:35.120 --> 47:38.589
I overheard
your conversation.
That woman can't control...

47:38.589 --> 47:41.526
Get your arm off me,
madam, or I'll put
you in a home.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.669
NICK: I cannot do my
job with a kid around.
RUBIO: Nick!

47:51.669 --> 47:53.638
I do not like kids.
Nick!

47:53.638 --> 47:55.573
Why does he have
to stay in my house?

47:55.573 --> 47:57.075
Why can't he stay
with somebody else?

47:57.075 --> 48:00.211
Believe me, you wouldn't
even be my second choice
for him to stay with,

48:00.211 --> 48:02.447
but the kid
is comfortable
with you. Come on.

48:02.447 --> 48:05.383
How long can it last?
Give me a break.

48:08.653 --> 48:11.256
Besides, you have such
a lovely rapport with him.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.328
Let's go.

48:19.297 --> 48:23.568
You're going to listen
to Mr. McKenna, right?

48:23.568 --> 48:26.037
Detective McKenna.
Detective McKenna.

48:26.938 --> 48:29.607
Look at me.
Devon, look at me.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.712
You won't leave here
without him, right?

48:34.712 --> 48:36.381
Grandma, he's got a gun.

48:36.381 --> 48:38.616
I'm sure he has.

48:38.616 --> 48:42.387
And you won't leave him here
and go around playing
cowboys and Indians.

48:42.387 --> 48:44.655
Lady, the next time
somebody breaks
into your apartment,

48:44.655 --> 48:48.193
why don't you
call the bunkhouse
and ask for a cowboy?

48:48.193 --> 48:50.528
I'm sure they'd come
a lot faster than you.

48:50.528 --> 48:52.630
(LOUDLY)
I've been busting
my chops all my life...

48:52.630 --> 48:55.166
Has anybody seen
Barnyard Cop?

48:55.433 --> 48:56.534
What?

48:56.534 --> 48:59.270
He always
asks his partner,
"What comes after 'L'?"

48:59.604 --> 49:01.072
I don't know.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.573
Bow. Don't you get it?

49:02.573 --> 49:04.675
Elbow!
(COUGHING)

49:06.744 --> 49:10.248
You hit me one more
time with your elbow,

49:10.248 --> 49:13.518
I'm gonna rip it off
and wave it at you.

49:13.518 --> 49:16.321
You keep pulling
that attitude
with my grandson...

49:16.321 --> 49:19.290
I don't have an
attitude, lady. I'm
just a police officer.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.259
I do not
have an attitude.

49:24.095 --> 49:25.163
Come here.

49:27.532 --> 49:29.300
Take care of
yourself, Devon.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.501
I will.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.977
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

50:12.043 --> 50:13.378
Hey, Nick.
Mmm-hmm?

50:13.378 --> 50:15.680
Is a hundred grand
the same as 100,000?

50:16.214 --> 50:17.382
Yeah. Why?

50:19.317 --> 50:22.287
The guy in the warehouse
said it. "A hundred grand."

50:25.756 --> 50:29.060
I heard it was more
like a hundred million.

50:31.729 --> 50:33.164
Wait.
Hmm?

50:33.598 --> 50:34.765
Swords.

50:34.765 --> 50:36.101
What swords?

50:36.101 --> 50:37.568
Come on. It's fun.

50:37.568 --> 50:40.138
My friend Raymond
can piss eight feet.

50:40.138 --> 50:42.507
Well, Raymond's my new hero.
Just watch what you're doing.

50:42.507 --> 50:44.142
Come on,
this will be...

50:44.142 --> 50:45.476
(URINATING)

50:51.482 --> 50:52.583
Sorry.

50:59.490 --> 51:00.725
Good night, kid.

51:01.726 --> 51:03.094
Hey, Nick.

51:03.361 --> 51:04.462
Yeah?

51:05.430 --> 51:07.398
Aren't you gonna
read me a story?

51:07.398 --> 51:08.466
You want to be
a police officer,

51:08.466 --> 51:10.601
you gotta
get your batteries
recharged, all right?

51:10.601 --> 51:14.105
And besides,
you're eight-years-old.
I'm not going to read to you.

51:14.105 --> 51:16.241
Don't you know
anything about kids?

51:16.241 --> 51:17.542
It relaxes us.

51:43.534 --> 51:45.803
Once upon a time,

51:45.803 --> 51:48.506
"Randy Milligan

the Kansas City Hospital

Give me a break. It's a story.

"Milligan was
knocked unconscious

find out, Chu?

53:41.886 --> 53:43.654

is with McKenna.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.263

55:26.957 --> 55:29.059
So you're dumping the kid?

55:29.059 --> 55:33.464
I gave him to McPhail.
McPhail already has
some kids, all right?

55:33.464 --> 55:34.699
I'm not used to
this kind of stuff.

55:34.699 --> 55:35.766
What kind of stuff?

55:35.766 --> 55:38.803
Look,
I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm not a babysitter.

has gotten to you, huh?

56:29.820 --> 56:31.822
Do we let him slide?

something about Nick.

56:53.110 --> 56:56.146
Eight years ago,
there was a drug bust.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.949
His partner was killed.

It was nobody's fault,

You understand what
I'm trying to tell you?

57:07.458 --> 57:09.627
After that he wouldn't
let anyone close.

57:09.627 --> 57:11.696
He wouldn't be friends
with anything that breathed.

57:13.531 --> 57:15.065
But it wasn't his fault.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.103
I know that.
Try convincing Nick.

Big joke, huh, McKenna?

Hey, Nick.
Uh-huh?

police business

Hey, partner,
how you doing?

You want speed,
come on over and
give me some help.
