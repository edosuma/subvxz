YOU GOT FEENY THIS YEAR?

00:24.867 --> 00:25.400
YEAH. YOU?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.900
YEAH. WHICH COURSES?

00:26.900 --> 00:27.400
ALL OF THEM.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.300
ME, TOO.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.600
OH, BOY.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE IT
THROUGH THE WHOLE SUMMER

00:33.400 --> 00:34.467
WITHOUT TOPANGA.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.667
I FEEL BAD ABOUT
HER PARENTS SPLITTING UP,

00:36.667 --> 00:38.600
BUT SHE'S TAKING IT
A LITTLE HARD.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.934
I MEAN, SO HER PARENTS
HATE EACH OTHER.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.367
GET OVER IT.

00:42.367 --> 00:45.300
MY MOM WALKED OUT ON MY FAMILY
WHEN I WAS 9, AND I'M FINE...

00:45.300 --> 00:47.000
FINE.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.500
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BUDDY?

00:51.500 --> 00:53.967
I JUST HAD
SUCH A BAD YEAR...

00:53.967 --> 00:55.100
BAD YEAR.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.767
WELL, BUCK UP,
BUCKER.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.800
ANGELA'S ON HER WAY HERE,

00:58.800 --> 01:00.700
AND EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.100
I ASKED HER TO BE
MY GIRLFRIEND AGAIN.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.600
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

01:04.600 --> 01:06.734
SHE GAVE ME
A KISS ON THE CHEEK,

01:06.734 --> 01:09.000
WHICH I TAKE TO MEAN
THAT SHE'S IN LOVE.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.500
YOU THINK I'M READING
TOO MUCH INTO THIS?

01:11.500 --> 01:13.967
NO. THAT'S ALL I GET.
YOU KNOW WHY?

01:13.967 --> 01:15.567
BECAUSE THESE GIRLS THINK

01:15.567 --> 01:18.200
THEY'VE GOT US WRAPPED
AROUND THEIR LITTLE FINGERS.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.900
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SUGGESTION.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.700
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE SUGGESTION.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.200
WE PLAY IT COOL.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.100
A LITTLE COOLER
WITH THE EMOTIONS.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.900
HEY, CORY.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.100
AAH! I DON'T
BELIEVE IT!

01:32.100 --> 01:35.400
TOPANGA, HONEY,
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

01:38.900 --> 01:41.600
MY PARENTS OFFICIALLY
FILED FOR DIVORCE

01:41.600 --> 01:42.800
THIS MORNING.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.100
W-WELL, THAT'S --
THAT'S BAD.

01:45.100 --> 01:48.367
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.667
IT'S OKAY.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.300
HEY, SHAWN.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.967
I'M SORRY, TOPANGA.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.500
I'M SORRY, TOO. I'VE JUST
ACCEPTED THAT MY PARENTS

02:00.500 --> 02:02.567
ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND

02:02.567 --> 02:04.567
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
TOGETHER.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.100
WELL, IT'S, UH,

02:06.100 --> 02:09.200
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO FACE REALITY,

02:09.200 --> 02:11.734
AND I'M GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

02:11.734 --> 02:14.567
NOW WE CAN GET BACK
TO PLANNING OUR WEDDING.

02:19.734 --> 02:22.400
NOW WE CAN GET BACK
TO PLANNING OUR WEDDING.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.800
HERE WE GO.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.600
CORY, I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.100
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED ANYMORE.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.233
EVEN THOUGH
WE LOVE EACH OTHER?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.700
SO DID MY PARENTS.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.867
HEY, EVERYBODY.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.100
ANGELA!

02:43.100 --> 02:44.867
BIGGER HELLO THAN ME.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

02:44.867 --> 02:45.867
HI, ANGELA.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.934
HI, SHAWN.
HI, CORY.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.934
HI. TOPANGA,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

02:50.934 --> 02:52.233
WHAT IS GOING ON?

02:52.233 --> 02:54.000
SHE'S CALLING OFF
THE WEDDING.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.233
AGAIN?

02:55.233 --> 02:57.200
EVEN THOUGH
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.100
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT "LOVE" ANYMORE.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.734
WHAT IS WITH PUTTING QUOTES
AROUND THE WORD "LOVE"?

03:01.734 --> 03:03.734
I'M PUTTING QUOTES
AROUND THE WORD "LOVE"

03:03.734 --> 03:05.667
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
"LOVE" EXISTS.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.033
OF COURSE LOVE EXISTS.

03:07.033 --> 03:09.367
THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING
I'VE EVER "HEARD."

03:09.367 --> 03:12.000
DID YOU THINK ABOUT
WHAT I ASKED YOU

03:12.000 --> 03:13.600
BEFORE THE SUMMER?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.300
YOU DON'T THINK
LOVE EXISTS?

03:15.300 --> 03:16.600
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.233
SHE'S STRESSED OUT.
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD.

03:21.233 --> 03:24.000
IF LOVE EXISTS, WHY DO PEOPLE
HURT EACH OTHER?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.500
WHY DO THEY?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.500
THEY DON'T!

03:26.500 --> 03:27.600
SHE'S JUST SAYING THAT

03:27.600 --> 03:30.000
BECAUSE YOUR HAIR
LOOKS BETTER THAN HERS.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.300
TOPANGA,
I WOULDN'T HURT YOU.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.500
YOU SAY THAT NOW.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.200
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I WOULDN'T HURT YOU?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.200
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.400
THAT'S WHY
I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

03:45.233 --> 03:46.500
SHE'S NUTS.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.700
ANGELA, DON'T LET HER
INFLUENCE YOU.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.834
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.
TRUST YOUR HEART.

03:51.834 --> 03:54.767
DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN
BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN AND HEART

03:54.767 --> 03:56.700
ARE ENEMIES,
AND YOUR BRAIN WILL --

03:56.700 --> 03:59.300
TOPANGA MAKES SENSE.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.600
KILL ME DEAD.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.600
WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED BEFORE SUMMER?

04:07.600 --> 04:08.800
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:08.800 --> 04:12.033
AT FEENY'S WEDDING,
I PUT MY HAND ON YOUR HAND

04:12.033 --> 04:14.133
AND YOU PULLED IT AWAY,

04:14.133 --> 04:17.133
AND I DID IT AGAIN
AND YOU PULLED IT AWAY.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.133
SO?

04:19.133 --> 04:22.500
YOU KNOW YOU LIKED IT.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.400
WE'RE FRIENDS.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.667
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.667
I CAN HATE YOU OR LOVE YOU.
THOSE ARE THE CHOICES.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.400
SHE GOT THIS FROM TOPANGA.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.100
IF YOU KNEW HOW
TO KEEP YOUR GIRLFRIEND --

04:35.100 --> 04:37.934
KEEP HER WHAT?
HAPPY? PLEASANT? QUIET?

04:37.934 --> 04:40.900
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.400
HEY, GUYS,
WELCOME BACK.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.867
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

04:43.867 --> 04:45.900
HELLO, JACK AND RACHEL.
VERY GOOD.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.900
JUST THE PEOPLE
TO TELL THESE WOMEN

04:47.900 --> 04:49.834
HOW TO KEEP
THEMSELVES IN LINE.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.700
WILL YOU PLEASE
TELL THESE TWO

04:51.700 --> 04:54.200
THAT BEING IN LOVE
IS THE GREATEST THING?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.033
TELL THEM.
GIRLS, LISTEN. LISTEN.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.500
JACK AND I BROKE UP.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.000
YOU MORONS.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.800
YOU KILLED US.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.300
TOPANGA! YOU'RE G--

05:07.300 --> 05:10.200
YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN
TO THEM?

05:10.200 --> 05:12.200
FRIENDS, OKAY?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.200
HATE YOU OR LOVE YOU,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.000
AND KNOW THIS --

05:16.000 --> 05:18.934
I HATE
AS GOOD AS I LOVE.

05:18.934 --> 05:20.867
GOODBYE, SHAWN.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.834
FINE. GOODBYE.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.233
YOU'RE GOING?

05:24.233 --> 05:27.000
FINE. GOODBYE.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
ANGELA?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.033
IT IS GOING TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE,

05:31.033 --> 05:32.767
SINCE WE'RE NOT
TOGETHER ANYMORE,

05:32.767 --> 05:34.400
US LIVING
IN THE SAME APARTMENT.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.900
YEAH, I MEANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.600
EVERYBODY,
LOOK AT MY HEAD!

05:40.600 --> 05:41.867
NO. I PROMISED MYSELF,

05:41.867 --> 05:43.800
"I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK
AT HIS HEAD."

05:43.800 --> 05:46.100
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
I THINK IT WAS CLEAR

05:46.100 --> 05:48.467
THAT MY LIFE NEEDED
EXAMINATION AND CHANGE.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.934
I THINK IT WAS CLEAR
THAT A DRASTIC MEASURE

05:50.934 --> 05:53.000
NEEDED TO BE TAKEN
SO THAT ERIC MATTHEWS

05:53.000 --> 05:55.367
COULD REACH THE NEXT PLATEAU
IN HIS LIFE --

05:55.367 --> 06:00.767
IN MY LIFE --
IN ALL OF OUR LIVES.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.900
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT HE DID --

06:02.900 --> 06:05.800
WHAT I DID --
WHAT HE ALL DID?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.100
NO!
NO!
NO!

06:08.100 --> 06:11.200
OKAY, ERIC,
TELL US WHAT YOU DID.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.367
I DID A LITTLE SOMETHING
CALLED THIS...

06:28.567 --> 06:30.033
ERIC, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.500
YOU SWORE
YOU'D NEVER CUT IT.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.400
I DIDN'T JUST CUT IT.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.467
I HAD, LIKE,
A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.

06:36.467 --> 06:40.100
I HAD A DEEPLY MEANINGFUL,
LIFE-ALTERING METAMORPHOSIS.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.867
I ALSO GOT A BIKINI WAX.
CHECK THIS OUT.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.834
AAH, NO!

06:44.834 --> 06:46.233
ERIC, PLEASE.

06:46.233 --> 06:49.900
ALL RIGHT, SO, ANYWAY,
I'M GETTING MY HAIR CUT, RIGHT?

06:49.900 --> 06:52.600
I'M SITTING ON THE PONY
AND I'M WATCHING

06:52.600 --> 06:55.567
MY ONCE-PRECIOUS LOCKS
FALL TO THE FLOOR.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.100
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
THAT THE STUFF

06:58.100 --> 07:00.667
THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
TO ME LAST WEEK

07:00.667 --> 07:03.000
DOESN'T MEAN A THING
TO ME TODAY,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.400
SO THIS NEW HAIRCUT
SYMBOLIZES THE NEW ERIC,

07:05.400 --> 07:06.934
THE SMARTER ERIC.

07:06.934 --> 07:09.800
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WHEN YOUR HAIR GROWS BACK?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.700
IT'S NOT GOING
TO GROW BACK.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.467
I GOT MY RECEIPT.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.667
AH, MY FAVORITE COUPLE.
BACK TOGETHER, HMM?

07:20.667 --> 07:23.667
MR. FEENY, JUST THE MAN
TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.800
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
TOPANGA?

07:25.800 --> 07:27.734
YEAH, SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S TERRIFIC.

07:27.734 --> 07:30.667
SHE'S CALLING OFF THE WEDDING
IS HOW TERRIFIC SHE IS.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.700
HELLO, MR. FEENY.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.934
WELL, THIS IS REALLY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

07:34.934 --> 07:37.734
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:37.734 --> 07:40.734
YOU HAVE BEEN BUTTING INTO
MY BUSINESS MY ENTIRE LIFE.

07:40.734 --> 07:43.300
THAT IS 19 YEARS
OF BUTTING, BABY.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.700
AND NOW, WHEN I ACTUALLY
NEED BUTTING,

07:45.700 --> 07:47.133
WHY YOU DON'T BUTT?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.100
OH, BACK OFF.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.567
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, TOPANGA?

07:52.567 --> 07:55.100
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
DIVORCED LIKE MY PARENTS.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.567
DIVORCE IS DEVASTATING
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

07:57.567 --> 08:00.100
TOPANGA, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO GET DIVORCED, OKAY?

08:00.100 --> 08:01.800
WE LOVE EACH OTHER
TOO MUCH.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.300
CORY THINKS ANYTHING
CAN BE MAGICALLY RESOLVED

08:04.300 --> 08:05.700
WITH "LOVE."

08:05.700 --> 08:08.767
HOW ABOUT I BITE OFF
THOSE FINGERS RIGHT NOW?

08:08.767 --> 08:10.867
OVER HALF
OF ALL MARRIAGES FAIL.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.834
IT'S EVEN WORSE
WITH PEOPLE OUR AGE.

08:12.834 --> 08:15.100
EVERY STATISTIC
THAT YOU THROW AT ME

08:15.100 --> 08:17.367
IS GOING TO BE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.400
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.867
I CARE ABOUT YOU AND ME.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.200
IF EVERY MARRIAGE FAILED
EXCEPT ONE,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.700
I'D GUARANTEE YOU
THAT ONE WOULD BE OURS.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.934
UH, FEENY?

08:26.934 --> 08:29.033
TOPANGA,
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN YOU

08:29.033 --> 08:31.133
TO BE A PRACTICAL THINKER.

08:31.133 --> 08:34.400
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH A TERRIBLE TIME

08:34.400 --> 08:37.467
AND IT'S AFFECTING YOU,
BUT THIS, ULTIMATELY,

08:37.467 --> 08:40.567
HAS TO BE ABOUT
YOU AND CORY, NO ONE ELSE.

08:40.567 --> 08:43.600
YOU SEE THAT?
ULTIMATELY ABOUT YOU AND CORY.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
ULTIMATELY YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
IF YOU WANT TO MARRY ME.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.000
THANKS.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.400
I THINK WE'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.934
I THINK WE GOT TO HER.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.567
FEENY!

08:59.834 --> 09:02.400
ERIC!

09:02.400 --> 09:04.800
NO, IT'S ME.
IT'S ERIC.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.700
OH, SEE, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR NOT RECOGNIZING ME.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.567
I DO RECOGNIZE YOU, ERIC.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.867
IT'S BECAUSE
I GOT MY HAIR CUT, SEE?

09:11.867 --> 09:14.767
SEE, THIS NEW HAIRCUT
KIND OF SYMBOLIZES

09:14.767 --> 09:16.400
THE NEW SMARTER ERIC.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.800
IS YOUR HEAD COLD?
BECAUSE MINE'S COLD.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.100
GOODBYE, MR. MATTHEWS.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.133
OH, BYE, MR. FEENY.
OH, WAIT!

09:22.133 --> 09:25.600
GREAT NEWS! I DON'T HAVE TO
SLEEP IN YOUR CAR ANYMORE.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.667
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
IN MY CAR?

09:27.667 --> 09:28.934
SINCE WHEN?

09:28.934 --> 09:31.233
OH, SINCE I GOT
