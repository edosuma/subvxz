20:43.368 --> 20:47.407
These abominations are why
the Tapestry is forbidden.

20:47.497 --> 20:51.661
You would use its knowledge
to annihilate
an entire species?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.326
It's against
everything we believe.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.584
The Lady wants to annihilate
all of the human species.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.290
Westerley's just
the beginning,
Leith will be next.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.172
Ifyou don't give us the rug,
we have an army to take it.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.597
I'm sorry
Zephyr hasn't schooled you
better in our ways.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.970
We are peaceful, yes...

21:10.395 --> 21:11.851
but we're not helpless.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.559
The tea...
She drugged the tea.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.483
Ididn't

21:18.570 --> 21:21.357
Ah. My secret ingredient.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.999
PIPPIN:
It's beautiful, isn't it?

21:32.542 --> 21:35.375
Neverhadland
like this on Qresh.
(CHUCKLES)

21:35.462 --> 21:36.451
Pip?

21:37.172 --> 21:38.503
What are you wearing?

21:39.174 --> 21:40.289
It's itchy as shit,

21:40.383 --> 21:43.921
but hells if I ain't rocking
the crap out of it, right?

21:45.138 --> 21:47.299
How are you...

21:47.390 --> 21:48.630
What is...

21:50.810 --> 21:53.552
Okay, it'sjust...
It's a dizzy spell.

21:53.646 --> 21:57.355
It's totally norms
when you're super-sized.

21:57.859 --> 22:00.100
Oh, my gods,
oh, my gods, oh, my gods...
Yeah.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.685
Ihope
she takes after you.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.155
”Shell?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.945
Great Mother says
it's a girl.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.951
She's kicking.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.362
(LAUGHS)

22:13.458 --> 22:15.619
Sweet mother of shit.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.622
Strong heart.
Just like her mama.

22:21.799 --> 22:25.508
No.lhaveto
getback

22:25.595 --> 22:27.961
Westerly needs me.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.138
Leith needs you.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.973
Maybe ifyou'd stayed home
like a good daughter,

22:33.061 --> 22:36.474
then I'd still
be alive.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.103
The real Pip
would never say that.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.534
Then what would
|say,Zeph?

22:48.618 --> 22:49.733
WARDEN: Wake up, Jaqobis.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.442
These animals
belong in cages,

22:51.538 --> 22:52.744
not playing
hide and damn sneak.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.037
Johnny's got the prisoners
isolated in the yard.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.625
We can still
contain the situation.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.078
Well, there's a console
I can use

22:58.169 --> 23:00.581
in psych ward
to lock down the yard.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.334
The psych ward's
quieter than I remember.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.256
Well, we upped their meds
after the riot.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.801
I got a stash of weapons
in my office.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.846
D'AVIN: Mightwanna
call the doctor first.
What's wrong?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.641
Little less drooly
than uje.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.938
They're not
overmedicated.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.401
I think they're dead.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.901
We're coming
for you, junkie!

23:34.622 --> 23:36.408
Coaches are
supposed to coach.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.000
JOHN: Sorry, dudes,
emergency drill.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.496
The Warden wants us
back in our cells
until she gets here.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.793
D'AVIN: (OVER PA)
All prisoners,

23:43.423 --> 23:45.789
So,lguess
second chances are bullshit.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.419
I'm sure it's nothing,
but the sooner we get

23:47.510 --> 23:49.546
in our hidey-holes,
the sooner
we can sort this out.

23:49.637 --> 23:50.922
You want us all
to work as a team,

23:51.014 --> 23:52.424
then why don't you
get on the level with us?

23:52.515 --> 23:54.597
Can't expect us
to risk our lives
killing aliens

23:54.684 --> 23:56.675
and then treat us
like criminals.

23:57.562 --> 24:00.474
Durek was killed.
Durek was stationed
near psych ward.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.055
My team was
nowhere near there.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.732
But my team was.
Smart money says,

24:04.819 --> 24:07.026
the Warden thinks
it was me.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.069
You're the only one
who didn't go
into the vents, Mace.

right, Killjoy.

No more small spaces.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.529
There's no way in hell

24:17.624 --> 24:19.205
I'm going back
in a cage!

Pip... What? She...

24:30.219 --> 24:31.675
Drugged us, yes,

24:31.763 --> 24:34.004
and threw us down
a godsdamn well.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.430
No,no,no,no,no.
She threw us in the pit.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.345
Ihaveto
get out of here.
Yeah, that's the plan.

24:38.436 --> 24:39.972
I have to get out!

24:40.063 --> 24:43.476
That's the plan,
but first you need to
pull your shit together.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.648
(CRYING)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.192
Hey, hey.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.110
How many times
have they put you in here?

24:50.490 --> 24:54.233
I was eight
the first time...

24:54.327 --> 24:56.318
Making letters in the sand.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.572
Ten the second,
questioning an Elder.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.623
And then they threw me
in here for three months

25:06.172 --> 25:07.878
on my 12th name day...

25:08.383 --> 25:11.875
after catching me
in the Tapestry room.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.961
And now I let them
do it again.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.672
How can I be a genius
if I'm so godsdamn stupid?

25:17.767 --> 25:20.224
How many times
have I taken back Khlyen

25:20.311 --> 25:24.020
after everything
he's done to me?

25:24.107 --> 25:26.098
To be fair,
you are a slow learner.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.348
(CHUCKLES)

25:27.694 --> 25:28.809

You brawn, l brain.

We've seen the light.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.891
Well?

26:06.983 --> 26:09.816
Well, your white blood
cell count is rising.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.735
For now, it's working.

26:12.822 --> 26:15.438
It doesn't feel
like it's working.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.149
Give the sedative time
to take effect.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.782
I spent eons in the Green
biding time.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.738
But out here I can actually
feel it passing,

26:23.833 --> 26:26.245
and it is so, so boring.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.793
How do you handle it?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.996
We read, rest.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.125
Read to me, then.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.337
But there aren't
any books here.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.670
Oh, please, you love telling
your silly stories.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.845
"When the days were long
and the nights were deep..."

26:42.935 --> 26:45.187
Days. "Days were deep."

26:45.271 --> 26:47.136
That's what I said.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.101
Conﬂnue.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.443
When the nights were long,

26:53.529 --> 26:54.814
and the days were deep...

26:55.782 --> 26:57.067
there lived a star...

26:58.034 --> 27:01.367
Who shined brighter
than all her sisters
in the sky.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.736
But she was restless.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.953
For mil/ennia she had
watched humans from above,

27:08.044 --> 27:11.878
and now, being curious,
she took their shape...

27:11.964 --> 27:15.331
to learn
what it was to feel.

27:15.426 --> 27:19.465
The star walked among humans
for so long, she forgot
she wasn’t one ofthem,

27:19.931 --> 27:21.387
and when her star-sisters

27:21.474 --> 27:22.839
mocked her for this,

27:22.934 --> 27:24.970
she killed the humans

27:25.061 --> 27:29.270
to prove she was
still as cold
and bright as they were.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.315
But when she returned
to the sky...

27:34.237 --> 27:36.853
she missed
her human friends.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.233
Having learned at last

27:39.116 --> 27:40.697
what it is to feel.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.489
Did this star have a name?
No.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.741
Not in the story.

27:46.165 --> 27:50.033
Maybe... she'd like
to have a name.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.633

and take the shot.

did you get the gun, Mace?

28:18.614 --> 28:21.606
You lifted it off Durek.
Yeah, still got the touch.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.405
Get in. Go, go.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.329
Prisoners aren't
the only ones

28:28.416 --> 28:29.701
with scores to settle.

28:29.792 --> 28:30.907
So, you made sure
he couldn't.

28:32.295 --> 28:33.751
Ididn't
kill him, junkie.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.500
Look, we all wanted
that inverted
testicle dead,

28:36.924 --> 28:38.960
but you need to
give me the gun now,
or I can't help you.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.088
Way to harsh my hero.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.798
I thought we were supposed
to trust each other.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.600
That's a hell of
a lot easier
when l have the gun.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.481
Their medication feeds
malfunctioned,

28:55.568 --> 28:57.524

28:57.778 --> 28:59.939
You were
supposed to be
monitoring them.

29:00.031 --> 29:01.737
I'm supposed
to have staff.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.655
We're supposed
to report
being held hostage.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.734
There are a lot of things
that we're supposed to do.

29:05.828 --> 29:09.036
Prison bureaucracy
won't mean jack
when Lady Stabbybugs

29:09.123 --> 29:10.488
is eating your face.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.699
Yes, the scans
you showed me
are terrifying.

29:12.793 --> 29:13.953
You know what else
is terrifying?

29:14.045 --> 29:15.330
If any one
of these psychos

29:15.421 --> 29:18.959
would get loose
during your war
or Coren's riots.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.586
Malfunction
did us a favor.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.671
A... "favor"?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.505
These were people.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.007
They didn't
see you that way.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.680
That's why we have
to lock them up.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.635
He wasn't strapped
into his feed.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.557
No.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.522
Ihadto
smother that one
with a pillow,

29:41.614 --> 29:43.445
and that idiot Durek
interrupted.

29:43.532 --> 29:47.275
This is so going
on your staff review.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.702
No one's going to
read it if they all
think we're dead.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.825
Thanks to you
"blowing up the ship."

29:51.916 --> 29:55.283
You're supposed to
save lives, asshole.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.123
That's what I'm doing,

29:58.214 --> 30:00.125
but you have to cut out
the tumors first.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.128
Sweet dreams.
I'll be back in a bit.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.130
Promise you won't
feel a thing.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.344
What have you
done with Dutch?

30:15.439 --> 30:18.647
Safely escorted
off our borders.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.986
What, you think
I fed her to the hogs?

30:21.445 --> 30:24.278
She'll come back for me
with friends.

30:24.365 --> 30:27.448
Perhaps, but it's only
your body they'll find.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.116
You came from our soil,
and to it,

30:29.203 --> 30:31.239
you shall return.

30:32.081 --> 30:35.073
But I'd rather
your body stick around.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.873
You're one of
my favorites.

30:36.961 --> 30:40.169
You punished me
for everything
I ever was.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.497
Our ancestors'
pursuit of knowledge

30:42.591 --> 30:45.378
caused great suffering
across the J.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.721
I'm not responsible
for my ancestors' mistakes!

30:47.805 --> 30:50.046
And who cleans up
after them if not us?

30:50.141 --> 30:51.631
You never
had faith in me

30:51.726 --> 30:53.682
and the destiny
that I planned for you.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.181
Yeah, farming
and forced interbreeding

30:56.272 --> 30:58.058
wasn't really
gonna work out for me.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.770
They weren't
my favorites, either.

31:02.737 --> 31:06.525
If you do your duty
and give children
to the colony,

31:06.615 --> 31:10.949
it was always my plan
that you would succeed me.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.909
And then,
all of the secrets

31:16.000 --> 31:19.288
of the Tapestry
could be yours.

of our ancestors
bloom in you,

31:30.556 --> 31:32.421
and ifwhat you say
is true,

31:32.516 --> 31:34.598
we need you
to survive.

mistake.

A good friend
once said to me...

31:56.123 --> 31:58.284
that you never
really knew me.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.118
Because ifyou did,

32:02.213 --> 32:04.579
you'd know I'd never
abandon my family.

32:19.647 --> 32:22.639
Holistic medicine's
a science
even you can appreciate.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.145
I won't
miss this place.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.488
But I will
miss your baking.

32:45.339 --> 32:47.204
Time to end this.

32:48.968 --> 32:51.084
I'm sorry, Yala.

32:51.971 --> 32:52.960
What are you doing?

32:53.055 --> 32:55.421
I'm doing what I should have
done a long time ago.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.926
This isjust a shell.

32:57.017 --> 33:00.259
My true body won't die,
and Iwill kill you.

33:00.688 --> 33:04.476
I've already lived more lives
than I deserved.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.396
Wait.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.274
If it's just a shell,

33:11.365 --> 33:12.901
why are you so scared
of losing it?

33:12.992 --> 33:14.732
I'm not.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.653
I controlled you.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.703
I turned you against
everyone you trust.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.328
I did everything you did
to your little Yala,

33:23.419 --> 33:25.751
so why don't you love me
like she loved you?

33:28.090 --> 33:30.547
Or like
you still love her.

33:50.863 --> 33:51.898
Get some rest.

33:56.577 --> 33:57.566
CALVERT:
Upsy-daisy, Macie.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.947
Into your cell
with the rest
of the campers.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.033
Move!
(GROANS)

34:02.750 --> 34:05.662
Enough of this shit.
Failing grade, both of you.

34:05.753 --> 34:06.868
Ifyou turn on
your men in here,

34:06.962 --> 34:08.873
who the hells
is gonna trust
you down there?

34:09.548 --> 34:12.164
This is notjust
some stupid game.

34:12.259 --> 34:14.796
Westerley is counting on us
to work together.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.423
BEREN: Very heroic, Killjoy,

34:16.513 --> 34:19.300
and I hate to shit
on your teachable
moment, but...

34:19.391 --> 34:21.382
Therapy's a crock.

34:23.646 --> 34:26.979
Fancy, you there?
FANCY: (ON COMMS)
Standing by.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.682
Meet me at the evac site.
We're going in for Zeph.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.227
ZAIA: Looking for these?

34:36.492 --> 34:38.278
See, when Zeph
steals my shit,

34:38.369 --> 34:39.700
she always leaves a note.

34:39.787 --> 34:40.902
Zephyr writes now?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.782
That right is
for the Elders alone.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.864
They're holding out
on you.

34:44.959 --> 34:46.074
I recommend
some lady lit,

34:46.168 --> 34:48.124
makes bath time
way more fun.

34:48.212 --> 34:49.952
Time we settle
who's the better sister.

34:53.509 --> 34:54.589
You're fast.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.963
Mmm-hmm.
Also a trained assassin,

34:57.054 --> 35:00.171
champion fighter,
and really pissed off.

35:00.266 --> 35:03.303
But for Zeph's sake,
I'll give you a free pass.

35:03.394 --> 35:04.474
Just walk away, Zaia.

35:04.561 --> 35:08.053
I've wrestled a rabid bull
into his pen
during rutting season.

35:08.148 --> 35:11.140
You don't weigh
more than a wet calfling.

35:11.235 --> 35:15.444
All right. Enough with
the skinny-shaming.
You wanna fight?

35:16.448 --> 35:17.654
Let's pitch this shit.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.865
Zeph never
knew her place.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.236
She never
gives up!

36:05.331 --> 36:06.537
Always needs
to be right.

36:06.623 --> 36:09.239
Loyal as shit.
Can't shut up!

36:11.628 --> 36:12.879
Best brains,
beﬂerheaﬂ.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.255
(WHINES)

36:20.054 --> 36:22.716
I can't shut up,
I need to be right,

36:22.806 --> 36:24.467
and I wish you could
love that about me.

36:24.558 --> 36:25.547
The gods will curse you.

36:25.893 --> 36:29.602
The gods can suck it.
The only power
I answer to is science.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.234
BEREN: Gaseous Ryklex

36:45.329 --> 36:47.866
is absorbed almost
instantaneously.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.038
I promise you'll be asleep
when I euthanize you.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.081
That's very
sporting of you.

36:52.169 --> 36:55.286
This is what happens
when "enlightened" therapies

36:55.381 --> 36:57.542
obliterate common sense.
Oh, yeah?

36:57.633 --> 36:58.622
Obliterate this.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.428
Side effects to Ryklex
include blurred vision,

37:04.515 --> 37:06.096
tremors, and...
Sorry, champ...

37:06.183 --> 37:07.298
Floppy dick.

37:10.187 --> 37:14.226
Iwon't let you unleash
these monsters
on the people of Westerley.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.269
I'm a doctor.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.475
I swore an oath.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.564
CALVERT: Hey, DOC.

37:21.907 --> 37:22.896
(GROANS)

37:25.244 --> 37:27.860
Way to capture
the flag, Doc.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.334
Mace was right.
All those trips

37:39.425 --> 37:41.461
to the psych ward
really paid off.

37:41.552 --> 37:44.339
My tolerance
is through the roof!

37:46.390 --> 37:48.631
LUCY: I’ve decrypted
the Madelaine Tapestry.

37:48.725 --> 37:52.593
Once I’ve sifted the data,
we can isolate
The Lady’s weakness.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.771
Thanks, Luce.
I'll never take you
for granted again.

37:55.858 --> 37:58.099
Turin and Pree
were shit hackers.

38:01.864 --> 38:03.900
Homecomings
are the worst.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.481
It's like I was
raised by aliens.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.112
Hey.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.534
Some of us were
raised by aliens.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.036
You know, when lwas little,
everyone used to tell me,

38:15.127 --> 38:17.618
"Why can't you be
more like your sister?"

38:17.713 --> 38:20.671
And I tried. I copied
everything Zaia did.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.584
But I was copying
the wrong sister.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.509
Thanks for always
looking out for me.

38:31.018 --> 38:33.134
That's what
big sisters do.

38:36.773 --> 38:37.762
(SIGHS)

38:39.610 --> 38:41.771
Maybe once
we save the world,

38:41.862 --> 38:44.899
you and Zaia can go
and grab a beer
and sort your shit out.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.575
Mmm.

38:49.578 --> 38:52.866
My sister used to
wanna try and kill me,
too, remember?

38:56.335 --> 39:00.123
Do you miss her?
You never talk about Aneela.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.670
She's out there, Zeph.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.884
Somewhere.

39:10.641 --> 39:12.177
Then we'll
get her back.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.937
We don't give up
on this family.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.070
Nice work taking out
Doctor Deathwish.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.736
Yeah, Rennika really
needs to pay
more attention to HR.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.030
And pretty sweet
coaching

39:29.117 --> 39:31.859
getting Calvert and Mace
to play nice together.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.865
Well, not dying
is a strong motivator.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.450
Boom.

39:39.336 --> 39:42.999
So, uh, maybe
after this whole alien
takeover is over,

39:43.090 --> 39:45.126
we can double date.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.674
With Calvert?
Or Rennika.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.468
Or that cute
embezzler in 68-C.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.671
She seemed nice.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.130
And also
into the ladies.

39:53.976 --> 39:56.763
So, you have
something in common.

39:56.853 --> 39:57.933
Oh, man.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.932
You are terrible
at this.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.729
I really am. I...

40:03.527 --> 40:05.859
ljust wanna make sure
that you get
what you deserve.

40:05.946 --> 40:07.732
A date with
a lesbian embezzler?

40:07.823 --> 40:09.404
Love, asshole.

40:09.908 --> 40:10.988
I think we have
a standing date

40:11.076 --> 40:12.577
with a homicidal
prom queen first.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.118
Butaﬁen
if there is an after...

40:15.205 --> 40:16.411
If there is an after...

40:18.417 --> 40:21.909
you can pick the movie,
but Pree picks my date.

40:22.004 --> 40:23.244
Deal.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.880
So, you love Dutch?

40:26.967 --> 40:28.207
Figure of speech.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.587
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
You love her.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.134
I am still
bigger than you.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.802
D'av, kissy,
kissy, kissy.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.840
Okay, okay.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.595
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.392
Did Calvert or Rennika
say something about me?

40:39.479 --> 40:40.980
I'm not telling, bro.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.021
JOHN: To Leith harvest
and to new friends.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.567
D'AVIN: To friends lost.

40:52.743 --> 40:55.280
To friends
we'll see again.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.494
Cheers.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.953
Well, slap rne silly
and call me Milly.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.127
Did you make
all this, Fancito?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.838
Which means you're all
doing the dishes.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.300
(ALL LAUGH)

41:10.052 --> 41:12.418
He raids, he cooks,
he builds shit.

41:12.512 --> 41:13.501
Am I in love
with Fancy?

41:13.597 --> 41:15.087
Get in line, girl.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.678
(SOFT POP SONG PLAYING)

41:19.770 --> 41:23.183
Calling out your name

41:24.608 --> 41:30.103
Throwing pieces of us
to the flame

41:30.197 --> 41:33.564
Chase the blackness away

41:34.242 --> 41:36.824
For me

41:36.912 --> 41:40.700
There is no other

41:43.335 --> 41:45.701
This is why we're gonna
beat The Lady.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.208
Because we have this.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.633
She has no one.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.096
I feel better now.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.140
Thank you.

42:01.228 --> 42:03.640
And you'll still require
regular treatment.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.846
Until Jaq is found.

42:08.568 --> 42:11.935
You still miss them?
Your daughters?

42:13.615 --> 42:14.900
Yes.

42:16.076 --> 42:18.158
They were
the stars I followed.

42:19.955 --> 42:22.788
I could give you more
than they ever could.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.753
I will
give you a galaxy.
