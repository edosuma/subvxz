Yes. This one is good.

41:45.604 --> 41:47.138
KRIS: Oh.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.941
What? The Grand Slam
wants me?

41:49.975 --> 41:51.209
That's right.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.878
You seem surprised.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.813
Well, you know,
they usually go

41:54.846 --> 41:56.548
for more traditional
soul vocalists.

41:56.582 --> 41:57.649
(LAUGHS)

41:57.683 --> 41:59.250
She means real singers.

42:01.286 --> 42:04.155
No, I mean real
old-school singers,

42:04.189 --> 42:08.126
not new,
hot and flashy singers
such as yourself.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.829
Well,
I made a few phone calls,
stroked a few egos

42:10.862 --> 42:12.864
and I convinced them
that Roxie, here,

42:12.898 --> 42:14.633
is going to help boost
their ticket sales.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.335
I don't know, Lyla.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.571
I mean,
The Grand Slam audience
isn't very forgiving.

42:19.605 --> 42:22.273
They don't care
how many CDs you've sold,
you just better be good.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.776
Yeah. And you will be.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.344
FLY PHIL: Yo, yo, yo!

42:26.377 --> 42:28.113
Yo! What's up?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.180
We gettin' busy or what, yo?

42:29.214 --> 42:31.049
You know it!

42:31.082 --> 42:33.284
Okay. Okay,
who are you guys?

42:33.318 --> 42:35.153
Oh, these are
the dancers for my video.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.688
ALL: Dancers?

42:47.398 --> 42:48.934
Oh, you came to work?

42:48.967 --> 42:50.869
Levi, I should've called.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.338
Yeah, you should have.
I had a full house
last night.

42:53.371 --> 42:58.644
Sorry.
I forgot and I fell asleep.
Just in a really weird zone.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.378
Weird zone, huh?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.848
Yeah.

43:02.881 --> 43:03.949
Is this about
that girl, Roxie?

43:06.885 --> 43:10.088
No. No. I mean,
why would you say that?

43:10.121 --> 43:14.292
Just look at you,
your shoulders
are all slumped,

43:14.325 --> 43:16.862
you're lookin'
all lost and pitiful.

43:16.895 --> 43:18.797
(LAUGHING) That girl's
got your nose wide open.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.098
Is it that obvious?

43:20.131 --> 43:23.034
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.370
Did you tell her the truth?
That you're Truth?

43:25.403 --> 43:26.905
Not exactly.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.740
What does that mean?

43:28.774 --> 43:30.308
Well, Kris is into her
and he asked me

43:30.341 --> 43:32.043
if I would help him
hook up with her.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.980
So, for now,
Roxie is going to think
that Kris is Truth.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.248
What? Man, that is
just dumb! No.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.817
Listen, now you tell Kris
that you were
feelin' her first

43:38.850 --> 43:40.051
and he needs
to back on up!

43:40.085 --> 43:41.352
I can't do that.

43:41.386 --> 43:42.654
I mean,
me and Kris been homies

43:42.688 --> 43:43.421
since we were,
like, five years old.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.056
I don't wanna be a hater.

43:45.090 --> 43:48.193
All right, Cyrus,
there's nothing wrong

43:48.226 --> 43:50.328
with you tryin' to be
a good friend to Kris.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.900
But if you use that
as an excuse to not man-up

43:54.933 --> 43:56.702
because you're afraid
you might get rejected?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.339
Okay, I can
understand that, too.

44:01.372 --> 44:03.008
But you can't live
like that forever.

44:05.376 --> 44:08.346
Ah, yeah, I thought so.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.982
You won't tell
your daddy you work here
because he won't approve.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.151
You freeze up
when Bling gets
in your face

44:13.184 --> 44:15.186
and it's time for you
to get up on that stage.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.155
And then you get
tongue-tied

44:17.188 --> 44:18.890
when it comes to telling
Roxie how you feel.

44:18.924 --> 44:21.827
A girl like Roxie
would never go
for a guy like me.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.895
I mean,
look at me and look at Kris.

44:23.929 --> 44:28.266
He's cool, good-looking,
got that swagger.

44:28.299 --> 44:31.436
And I'm like
wallpaper in a hoody.

44:31.469 --> 44:34.039
Kris is a perfect match
for Roxie.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.174
Hey, that's not true.

44:36.207 --> 44:39.811
You just got to
speak up for yourself
and be who you really are.

44:39.845 --> 44:41.279
Who am I really?

44:41.312 --> 44:43.048
You're Truth!

44:43.081 --> 44:44.482
Oh.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.918
Yeah. And Truth
is a bad cat!

44:46.952 --> 44:48.319
He is?

44:48.353 --> 44:50.889
Yeah! Truth won
the Atlanta Records
rap contest.

44:50.922 --> 44:53.191
He got skills. He's smooth.
He got that sound.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.793
And you know what?

44:55.927 --> 44:56.928
That's you.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.932
I guess that is me.

45:00.966 --> 45:03.769
Yeah, but Roxie
wouldn't know it.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.137
I mean, how can you or Kris
even call yourselves "Truth"

45:06.171 --> 45:08.406
when y'all both
are just living one big lie?

45:10.842 --> 45:12.010
I guess that's
a valid question.

45:13.078 --> 45:15.046
Look, I gotta go.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.048
You need to figure out
what it is you want

45:17.082 --> 45:18.349
and then do
somethin' about it.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.252
Lock up when you leave.

you doing here?

I came to meet Kris.
You were just rapping.

(TURNS OFF MUSIC)

48:22.267 --> 48:23.634
You sound just like Kris.

Oh, that?
No, that wasn't me.
I was...

48:27.538 --> 48:30.641
This mic's not even on. See?
I was just lip-synching.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.144
Lip-synching?

48:33.178 --> 48:36.247
Yeah, that's one
of Kris' old tracks.

I guess I'm not just his DJ,
but I'm also his biggest fan.

48:41.652 --> 48:46.424
Wow! You might just be
the best lip-syncher
I've ever seen.

48:46.457 --> 48:50.595
Well, I do a lot of karaoke
so I'm pretty good at it.

48:50.628 --> 48:52.964
What are you doing here?

48:52.998 --> 48:55.133
Well, I came to meet Kris
so we could grab
an early dinner,

48:55.166 --> 48:56.567
but he hasn't shown up.

gonna make it.

and I'm starving.

49:05.476 --> 49:08.446
Oh, that's too bad.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.084
But I haven't eaten.

I don't know, maybe we can go
grab something together,
or not,

49:17.488 --> 49:20.325
I don't know
what you were thinking,
where your head was at.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.260
Which... I don't know,
but I'm just saying.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.529
I mean, we could...
It's up to you.

49:25.496 --> 49:26.664
(LAUGHS) Okay.

49:34.105 --> 49:35.273
I like the way
you handle yourself.

49:35.306 --> 49:36.641
What do you mean?

49:36.674 --> 49:38.143
You know,
when people like Bling

49:38.176 --> 49:39.344
and those journalists
say stuff about you.

49:39.377 --> 49:42.080
Oh, that flattering article
in Ether?

49:42.113 --> 49:44.049
Yeah, I mean, people think
they know about music,

49:44.082 --> 49:45.616
but don't know a thing.

49:45.650 --> 49:48.086
Like that vocoder you use,
just because
it's the "in" thing.

49:48.119 --> 49:50.488
It's a choice.
I can tell you can
sing a lil' bit.

49:51.189 --> 49:52.623
A "lil' bit"?

49:52.657 --> 49:53.791
I mean, you ain't
given me nothin' more

49:53.824 --> 49:55.060
than what I've heard
on the radio,

49:55.093 --> 49:56.361

Oh, really,
Mr. DJ-Engineering
Lip-Syncher?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.732
So, you got any other music
besides your pop hits
in your vault?

50:01.766 --> 50:03.601
Yeah, I've got
a few special ones

50:03.634 --> 50:06.171
for those who can think
outside the voice box.

50:06.204 --> 50:08.506
But Lyla says that vocoder's
the "in" thing right now.

50:08.539 --> 50:09.574
And she really
knows the business, so.

50:09.607 --> 50:12.177
Not everyone
who sells uses one.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.578
Well, I mean,
I know my voice is good,

50:13.611 --> 50:15.313
but I don't know
if it's special.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.714
You know,
to be just belting out tunes.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.416
I remember when
you sang in church

50:18.449 --> 50:19.684
and you were like
eight years old.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.719
(CHUCKLES)
You remember that?

50:21.752 --> 50:23.554
Yes, of course.
The little girl with
the big voice.

50:23.588 --> 50:24.589
You were awesome.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.357
I don't know about all that.

50:26.391 --> 50:29.427
Okay. Yeah, you were raw,
but the voice was there.

50:29.460 --> 50:30.528
You've got
a really great sound

50:30.561 --> 50:31.762
if you ever care
to bring it out.

50:31.796 --> 50:32.730
That sounds
like a challenge.

50:33.831 --> 50:35.600
It's more of a nudge.

50:35.633 --> 50:36.734
Maybe someday
I can hear some of
your other music.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.469
Maybe.

50:50.448 --> 50:52.517
No, no! It's perfect.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.722
So, what kind of music
do you like?

50:57.755 --> 51:00.358
Besides the obvious ones,
R&B and Hip-Hop.

51:00.391 --> 51:01.792
What else do you love?

51:01.826 --> 51:08.566
Oh,
Jazz, rock, country, salsa,
gospel, reggae, opera.

51:08.599 --> 51:09.867
Opera?

51:09.900 --> 51:13.104
Oh, yeah. Pavarotti?
He's the bomb.

51:13.138 --> 51:16.274
Bocelli, too. I also like
female opera singers,
like, Maria Callas...

51:16.307 --> 51:18.109
And Marian Anderson?

51:18.143 --> 51:20.645
Yeah! She's awesome!
You like opera?

51:21.746 --> 51:23.314
I like great singers.

51:23.348 --> 51:25.183
Me, too!

51:25.216 --> 51:26.551
I don't know,
I just like to be influenced

51:26.584 --> 51:27.552
by all kind of
things when I rap.

51:27.585 --> 51:28.786
What?

51:28.819 --> 51:31.156
I mean, when I
write for Kris.

51:31.189 --> 51:33.124
Yeah, I just think
it brings more foundation
to the sound.

51:33.158 --> 51:35.860
You know,
every note says something.

51:35.893 --> 51:37.562
And when it's all
strung together,

51:37.595 --> 51:38.596
they should tell
their own story.

51:40.465 --> 51:42.133
Wow.

51:42.167 --> 51:43.834
You do know your music.

51:45.736 --> 51:47.372
That's funny.

51:47.405 --> 51:49.607

why I got these!

1:03:32.276 --> 1:03:35.112
Knee pads. Fall down,
bounce right back up.

1:03:37.147 --> 1:03:39.116
You'll be fine.

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:40.817
Hey, Truth, can I talk
to you for a second?

1:03:42.252 --> 1:03:44.321
Wassup?

1:03:44.354 --> 1:03:47.224
You have to rap
live at the Grand Slam.
What're you gonna do now?

1:03:47.257 --> 1:03:49.259
Bro, you got the good ideas.
Think of something.

1:03:49.293 --> 1:03:51.161
I mean, after all,
the ladies love me,

1:03:51.195 --> 1:03:54.098
the camera loves me,
and Roxie loves me.

1:03:54.131 --> 1:03:55.599
You sure about that?

1:03:55.632 --> 1:03:58.202
What'chu mean?

1:03:58.235 --> 1:04:00.871
You're not turning
into a hater or nothing
like that, are you?

1:04:00.905 --> 1:04:02.873
Just trying to see
where your head's at.
That's all.

1:04:02.907 --> 1:04:05.876
Look, bro,
all I'm saying is Roxie's
a great girl and all,

1:04:05.910 --> 1:04:08.245
but I pretty much got
the situation in the bag.

1:04:08.278 --> 1:04:11.215
I mean,
after that video comes out,
and this Fox thing happens,

1:04:11.248 --> 1:04:14.051
I'm gonna be on tour
with all kinds of honies,

1:04:14.084 --> 1:04:16.653
you know,
so I'm not really trying
to be tied down.

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:19.056
Wait,
I thought you were serious
about Roxie though.

1:04:19.089 --> 1:04:20.958
I am. For now.

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:24.128
Kris, she's not
like other girls.

1:04:24.161 --> 1:04:26.130
Dude, I know,
but that's what I mean.

1:04:26.163 --> 1:04:27.898
All these girls,
they are different flavors

1:04:27.932 --> 1:04:29.934
and the variety
is what I like.

1:04:29.967 --> 1:04:31.401
You know, you can try
a little burger, son.

1:04:31.435 --> 1:04:34.038
They got the ribs,
the chicken fingers,
and the shake.

1:04:34.071 --> 1:04:37.541
I want all that. Don't you?
Come on, man.

than he looks?

Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
it couldn't be better.

Okay, this is kind of hard
for me to admit,

but I'm not sure
about myself.

1:07:13.230 --> 1:07:17.201
I mean, am I ready
to be there for Kris?
And be the girl he deserves?

1:07:18.502 --> 1:07:21.405
Wait. What are you saying?

1:07:21.438 --> 1:07:24.841
I'm saying Kris deserves
somebody who's real.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:28.145
Am I even worthy enough
to be his girl?

you're just kidding,

throw up in my mouth.

I'm here
to apologize to Roxie.

Roxanne, I'd like to
apologize for my behavior
in church on Sunday.

1:07:56.840 --> 1:08:00.510
My righteousness was sinful,
and I'm sorry.

1:08:01.911 --> 1:08:03.180
It's okay.

1:08:06.350 --> 1:08:11.155
Cyrus, may I ask
what business you have here?

1:08:11.188 --> 1:08:12.789
Listen, Cyrus,
I need you to get to work.

1:08:16.326 --> 1:08:17.727
The place is a mess,
and I'll never

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:19.296
have it ready in time
for opening.

1:08:20.230 --> 1:08:22.732
You work here?

1:08:22.766 --> 1:08:24.868
Yeah. But just part-time.
The part where I'm not
at the church.

1:08:26.903 --> 1:08:30.574

how this makes me look?

This isn't about you,
Dad, okay.

It's about the music.
It's what I'm good at.

1:08:35.912 --> 1:08:38.348

I'd be disrespecting myself.

not be fair to him.

the right thing to do, Jacob.

I'm disappointed.

I'm a songwriter.

I don't care what you are.

I don't care if
Jesus himself told you

1:10:27.857 --> 1:10:29.926
to go up in that club
and get a job.

And you failed that test.

just look at it?

you're on punishment.

You will not set foot
in that club again.

1:14:41.878 --> 1:14:44.180
It's like
we don't really connect
on a deep level.

1:14:44.213 --> 1:14:46.282
Like we see the world
in totally different ways,

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:49.586
and I just don't know
what to do.

1:14:49.619 --> 1:14:53.156
I guess I just wish he
and I connected more
like you and I do.

1:14:53.189 --> 1:14:55.659
Well, you can't really force
a connection, I guess.

1:14:57.093 --> 1:14:58.595
No, you can't.

1:15:08.605 --> 1:15:10.974
Hey, look!
I love this song.

1:15:18.081 --> 1:15:22.151
OLD FEMALE SINGER:
* When you appear

1:15:23.787 --> 1:15:26.089
* All of my dreams
are coming... *

1:15:26.122 --> 1:15:28.725
So old school.

1:15:28.758 --> 1:15:29.993
You should
do something with it.

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:31.895
What?

1:15:31.928 --> 1:15:33.963
You know what I mean.
Go to church with it.
Record it.

1:15:33.997 --> 1:15:35.565
No. The label
would never let me.

1:15:35.599 --> 1:15:37.567
Well, have you even asked?

1:15:37.601 --> 1:15:39.669
You have to put yourself
out there, Roxie.

1:15:39.703 --> 1:15:42.238
Roxanne Andrews,
the girl with the big voice
from church.

1:15:42.271 --> 1:15:44.307
That's the voice
that the whole world
needs to hear.

1:15:47.143 --> 1:15:49.078
You're just being nice.

1:15:49.112 --> 1:15:53.149
No, I'm not.
You have a gift, Roxie.

1:15:53.182 --> 1:15:56.686
You just got to step
out there and show people
what you can do.

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:58.722
Show them that
you're the real deal.

1:16:00.690 --> 1:16:03.092
Well, what about you,
Mr. Lip-Syncher?

1:16:04.828 --> 1:16:07.030
Maybe it's time
you turned on the mic.

1:16:13.336 --> 1:16:15.905
I gotta go,
Kris is taking me
to a jazz museum,

1:16:15.939 --> 1:16:17.874
which is by far
the coolest place
he's ever taken me.

1:16:21.110 --> 1:16:22.612
And, Cyrus,

1:16:24.648 --> 1:16:26.249
thanks for being there
for me.

1:16:49.438 --> 1:16:51.908
Have you girls got tickets
to the Grand Slam tomorrow?

1:16:51.941 --> 1:16:53.777
It's gonna be
a slammin' show,
starring me.

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:57.013
I heard
you're gonna rap live.
That is so cool.

1:16:57.046 --> 1:16:59.783
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's the plan.

1:16:59.816 --> 1:17:01.417
Excuse me,
I've gotta make a phone call.

1:17:01.450 --> 1:17:03.019
GIRL: Yeah.

1:17:03.052 --> 1:17:04.788
Kris.

1:17:04.821 --> 1:17:08.792
Yo, Cy, just the man
I need to see.
'Sup, baby.

1:17:08.825 --> 1:17:11.828
How was your date
at the jazz museum?

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:13.329
If you could just excuse me
for one second.

1:17:13.362 --> 1:17:16.265
Yo, easy, son,
there are other females here.

1:17:16.299 --> 1:17:19.102
You don't have
an original idea
in your whole body, do you?

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:20.369
What's your problem?

1:17:20.403 --> 1:17:22.438
My problem is you
playing with Roxie's emotions

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:25.108
and getting her
all messed up in the head
with your nonsense.

1:17:25.141 --> 1:17:28.712
Well, hold up,
preacher's boy.

1:17:28.745 --> 1:17:31.114
All right, you as much
a part of this as me,
so don't act all innocent.

1:17:31.147 --> 1:17:33.282
Yeah, I had my part in this,
and now I'm starting
to regret it.

1:17:33.316 --> 1:17:35.151
Listen, you need
to chill out

1:17:35.184 --> 1:17:36.853
and get wit' me
about this Grand Slam
show tomorrow.

1:17:36.886 --> 1:17:39.388
We in this together, Cyrus,
like it or not.

1:17:39.422 --> 1:17:40.690
And I got a little plan
that makes sure

1:17:40.724 --> 1:17:41.925
my talent goes
fully recognized,

1:17:41.958 --> 1:17:42.992
you feel me?

1:17:44.193 --> 1:17:45.795
Kris, you don't get it.

1:17:45.829 --> 1:17:47.296
Okay,
you get up on that stage,
you pop, you lock,

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:49.733
you jump around like an extra
from You Got Served.

1:17:49.766 --> 1:17:52.201
But you don't hear
the music at all,
and you don't feel it at all,

1:17:52.235 --> 1:17:54.037
and forget about your
rapping skills, son.

1:17:54.070 --> 1:17:56.072
You couldn't
wrap a present
if I spotted you a bow

1:17:56.105 --> 1:17:58.942
and some scotch tape.

1:17:58.975 --> 1:18:00.376
And you ain't
nothing but a hater.

1:18:00.409 --> 1:18:02.078
(CROWD MURMURING)

1:18:04.347 --> 1:18:05.749
And you know what else?

1:18:08.351 --> 1:18:09.886
You're a punk.

1:18:09.919 --> 1:18:11.254
'Cause you're one
of the best rappers

1:18:11.287 --> 1:18:12.355
I've ever heard
in my life, Cyrus,

1:18:12.388 --> 1:18:14.323
in my life,

1:18:14.357 --> 1:18:15.458
but every time Bling
comes around you let
him punk you, what?

1:18:15.491 --> 1:18:17.260
'Cause you're scared?

1:18:17.293 --> 1:18:21.464
You ain't got no guts, son.
And no heart.

1:18:21.497 --> 1:18:22.698
You're just a wimp.

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:25.802
(YELLING)

1:18:25.835 --> 1:18:28.237
Hey! Enough!
I said that's enough.

1:18:30.173 --> 1:18:33.176
You all know I don't tolerate
no fighting up in here.

1:18:33.209 --> 1:18:36.412
Now go home.
Get your mind right,
or don't come back at all.

1:18:37.814 --> 1:18:38.782
Go on.

1:18:45.421 --> 1:18:47.323
You're on your own tomorrow.

1:18:47.356 --> 1:18:50.493
And when
everyone laughs at you,
you'll see how it feels.

1:18:50.526 --> 1:18:53.930
I don't need you!
I don't need nobody!

1:19:29.532 --> 1:19:32.001
Cyrus, honey, are you okay?

1:19:35.471 --> 1:19:37.040
Kris isn't Truth.

1:19:38.942 --> 1:19:39.943
I am.

1:19:40.576 --> 1:19:41.477
What?

1:19:44.447 --> 1:19:49.085
I've been covering for him
this whole time.

1:19:49.118 --> 1:19:51.554
I mean, I can't let him
get up on the Grand Slam
stage by himself,

1:19:51.587 --> 1:19:53.990
he'll be humiliated.

1:19:54.023 --> 1:19:55.358
He won't be able
to show his face anywhere,

1:19:55.391 --> 1:19:57.493
at the club or anything.

1:19:57.526 --> 1:19:59.462
His life would be much worse
than mine ever was.

1:20:01.030 --> 1:20:04.367
Okay, so,
what are you gonna do?

1:20:14.210 --> 1:20:15.378
Oh!

1:20:15.411 --> 1:20:17.346
Going somewhere?

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:19.916
Dad, I know I'm on punishment
and all that,

1:20:19.949 --> 1:20:21.550
but today
is a very important day.

1:20:21.584 --> 1:20:23.987
Not just for myself,
but for my friend also.

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:26.355
So, I gotta do
what I gotta do.

1:20:27.656 --> 1:20:30.359
So I'm gonna head out.
Right now.

1:20:34.931 --> 1:20:37.366
Maybe not right now.
Maybe in, like,
an hour or so.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:41.137
Cyrus, I know
about your show.

1:20:41.170 --> 1:20:43.472
And before you say
another word,

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:45.641
I've been reading
your song lyrics.

1:20:45.674 --> 1:20:47.543
And I've actually
enjoyed them.

1:20:49.345 --> 1:20:52.648
Once I got past the fact
that they were rap songs.

1:20:52.681 --> 1:20:55.885
See, Son, I've realized
I've been focused

1:20:55.919 --> 1:20:59.455
on the type of music
as opposed to its message.

1:20:59.488 --> 1:21:05.294
And your songs
have messages of caring,
of sacrifice, devotion.

1:21:05.328 --> 1:21:08.397
Good Christian values.

1:21:08.431 --> 1:21:13.402
So maybe I've been too harsh
to put all rap into one box.

1:21:15.004 --> 1:21:17.540
So I guess
what I'm saying, Son...

1:21:19.508 --> 1:21:20.509
I'm sorry.

1:21:25.248 --> 1:21:26.449
(PATS BACK)

you two, we better get going
or you are gonna be late.

Wait, you're gonna
come watch?

1:21:35.658 --> 1:21:37.160
If that's okay with you.
Come on, honey.

1:21:37.193 --> 1:21:38.327
Okay, baby.

What? Why?
You look fantastic.

1:21:59.715 --> 1:22:02.551
Sweetie, I am bringing you
to the next level.

1:22:02.585 --> 1:22:05.688
I've got this whole
lunar landing theme
for your next tour.

1:22:05.721 --> 1:22:09.525
I'll explain
the details later,
but tonight we test the look.

1:22:09.558 --> 1:22:10.459
No!

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:15.131
I can't hide
behind these
gimmicks anymore.

1:22:15.164 --> 1:22:19.268
What good is it to get famous
if nobody knows
who I really am?

1:22:19.302 --> 1:22:22.005
I have my own voice.
I have my own style.

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:24.040
And if that's not
good enough,

1:22:24.073 --> 1:22:25.508
I guess I don't
wanna be a star.

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:28.344
Okay, listen,
we all love you
for who you are,

1:22:28.377 --> 1:22:33.182
but this is show business.
You gotta play the game.

1:22:33.216 --> 1:22:36.552
And I, my friend,
am the best coach
in the game.

Look, I know
you think you're helping,
and I love you for that,

1:22:41.057 --> 1:22:42.758
but I don't
love me like this.

1:22:42.791 --> 1:22:44.760
So I'm starting
fresh tonight.

1:22:44.793 --> 1:22:47.063
Sweetie,
you have to trust me...
I'm sorry.

1:22:47.096 --> 1:22:49.532
Maybe you picked
the wrong girl.

1:22:49.565 --> 1:22:51.434
Maybe you need
to find somebody else
to wear this wig.

1:22:53.436 --> 1:22:54.603
'Cause I'm done with it.

I couldn't leave you
just hanging out
in the wind like that.

1:23:28.537 --> 1:23:32.108
But after what I said to you,
you'd still come
through for me?

We've been friends
since back in the day.

1:23:36.112 --> 1:23:38.414
Besides, I said
some hurtful things
to you, too.

You didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

1:23:42.585 --> 1:23:44.587

1:23:44.620 --> 1:23:47.390
selfish and disrespectful
and I'm sorry.

I mean, to be honest,
I was jealous.

I was jealous that
I'm really not Truth.

I mean,
there have been nights
where I couldn't even sleep

1:23:57.866 --> 1:24:00.569

the fact that I'm not you,

1:24:00.603 --> 1:24:03.772

never be you, man.

for Lord of Da Bling!

1:26:10.366 --> 1:26:11.800
(CROWD CHEERING)

1:26:18.474 --> 1:26:20.809
Just tell her.
It will be fine.

1:26:20.843 --> 1:26:22.578
The "truth will
set me free," right?

1:26:24.613 --> 1:26:27.583
LYLA: Not too much.
Lightly, lightly.
Come on.

1:26:27.616 --> 1:26:29.184
I don't want to
see any creases.

1:26:30.753 --> 1:26:32.187
CYRUS: Roxie?

1:26:34.923 --> 1:26:36.692
Cyrus, hey!

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:39.395
You look different.

1:26:39.428 --> 1:26:40.796
I hope that's not
a bad thing.

1:26:40.829 --> 1:26:42.598
No. No, you look better.

1:26:43.031 --> 1:26:44.267
Thanks.

1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:45.601
We gotta go on.

1:26:46.669 --> 1:26:48.471
Okay. Wish me luck.

1:26:48.504 --> 1:26:50.506
You don't need it.
Just do you.

1:26:55.611 --> 1:26:58.947
In a short while,
these two will
battle here, live,

1:26:58.981 --> 1:27:01.417
for the Grand Slam Crown.

1:27:01.450 --> 1:27:04.853
But first, we have
a musical performance
by Roxie!

1:27:04.887 --> 1:27:08.391
(ALL CHEERING)

1:27:08.424 --> 1:27:12.495
Along with a newcomer
whose single is
blowing up the charts.

1:27:12.528 --> 1:27:17.733
So, Atlanta,
without further delay,
I give you Roxie and Truth!

1:27:17.766 --> 1:27:19.234
(CROWD CHEERING)

1:27:28.377 --> 1:27:32.415
* You're spinning round
and round and round
in my head

1:27:32.448 --> 1:27:33.582
* Head

1:27:33.616 --> 1:27:37.486
* Did you really mean
the words that you said?

1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:39.388
* Said

1:27:39.422 --> 1:27:43.659
* This is it, I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go?

1:27:43.692 --> 1:27:45.461
* Show me the truth

1:27:45.494 --> 1:27:48.464
* Is it gonna be me and you?

1:27:48.497 --> 1:27:50.833
* Is it gonna be me and you?

1:27:50.866 --> 1:27:53.469
* Is it gonna be
me and you? *

1:27:56.939 --> 1:27:58.707
Wow.

1:27:58.741 --> 1:28:00.909
"Wow" is right.
She's gonna be bigger
than I even imagined.

1:28:00.943 --> 1:28:02.311
You ready?

1:28:02.345 --> 1:28:03.679
Ready.

1:28:07.983 --> 1:28:10.486
Yo. Are we
going on or what?

1:28:10.519 --> 1:28:12.921
Nope. (CLEARS THROAT)
Not today.

1:28:12.955 --> 1:28:14.390
ROXIE: Give it up to the
up and coming performer

1:28:14.423 --> 1:28:16.024
that's close to my heart.

1:28:16.058 --> 1:28:17.493
Truth!

1:28:18.794 --> 1:28:20.095
(RAPPING)
* I know you gonna be mad

1:28:20.128 --> 1:28:21.330
* Feelings that you
thought you had

1:28:21.364 --> 1:28:23.999
* Was for another guy
Well, I'm that other guy

1:28:24.032 --> 1:28:26.569
* I'm just a shy kid
camouflaged before your eyes

1:28:26.602 --> 1:28:29.372
* And I knew my lyrics
were the key to see
the other side

1:28:29.405 --> 1:28:31.507
* I shoulda told you,
but I never had the courage

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:34.610
* And I thought
you really
wouldn't understand

1:28:34.643 --> 1:28:36.712
* And now
I'm up here just to let
my feelings surface

1:28:36.745 --> 1:28:38.747
* Apologizing for
disguising who I am

1:28:38.781 --> 1:28:41.517
* Tell me are you who
I thought you were

1:28:41.550 --> 1:28:44.453
* Or who I wanted you to be?

1:28:44.487 --> 1:28:49.057
* Did you do it all for him,
or were you only playing me?

1:28:49.091 --> 1:28:52.428
* I did it for you,
but I couldn't see it through

1:28:52.461 --> 1:28:54.430
* Roxie, I'm sorry

1:28:54.463 --> 1:28:58.667
* You're spinning round
and round and round
in my head

1:28:58.701 --> 1:28:59.902
* Head

1:28:59.935 --> 1:29:03.872
* Did you really mean
the words that you said?

1:29:03.906 --> 1:29:05.007
* Said

1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:07.576
* This is it, I gotta know

1:29:07.610 --> 1:29:09.778
* Should I stay
or should I go?

1:29:09.812 --> 1:29:11.747
* Show me the truth

1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:14.383
* Is it gonna be me and you?

1:29:14.417 --> 1:29:16.985
* Is it gonna me and you?

1:29:17.019 --> 1:29:19.655
* Is it gonna be me and you?

1:29:20.856 --> 1:29:21.657
You.

1:29:23.459 --> 1:29:25.494
* You're all I ever wanted

1:29:25.528 --> 1:29:28.431
* But I got caught
in a shadow
in the background

1:29:28.464 --> 1:29:31.467
* But I'm back now
And Kris was all
this and that

1:29:31.500 --> 1:29:34.870
* And my look
didn't really fit the rap
It didn't match

1:29:34.903 --> 1:29:37.105
* He had the style
and I had the swag

1:29:37.139 --> 1:29:39.675
* So I locked up my feelings
in the words he said

1:29:39.708 --> 1:29:41.877
* Give me your hand,
and I'll take off my mask

1:29:41.910 --> 1:29:44.112
* If you give me a chance,
that's all I ask

1:29:44.146 --> 1:29:46.915
* What you
expecting me to do?

1:29:46.949 --> 1:29:49.051
* First you were him
and now you're you

1:29:49.084 --> 1:29:52.187
* Now it's just me,
and you got me on my knees

1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:54.056
* Roxie, I'm sorry

1:29:58.861 --> 1:30:00.128
(CROWD CHEERING)

1:30:04.199 --> 1:30:10.639
Give it up
for Roxie and Truth!
Or whoever that guy was.

1:30:12.875 --> 1:30:14.910
So who's ready for some rap?

1:30:15.944 --> 1:30:17.546
Then, ladies and gentlemen,

1:30:17.580 --> 1:30:21.884
put your hands together
for Revelation
and Lord of Da Bling!

1:30:29.525 --> 1:30:31.560
Rox, come on, open up.

1:30:31.594 --> 1:30:33.929
I'm sorry, but we
were electric out there,
couldn't you feel it?

1:30:36.198 --> 1:30:38.066
No. Did you feel that?

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:40.603
I can't believe
it was you this whole time.

1:30:40.636 --> 1:30:42.471
You two are just
one big lie.

1:30:42.505 --> 1:30:43.906
No, you see,
what had happened was, I...

1:30:43.939 --> 1:30:47.175
I don't wanna hear it.
Please just get away from me.

1:30:47.209 --> 1:30:48.477
Such an idiot.

1:30:49.512 --> 1:30:53.148
No, Rox, you're not, I am.

1:30:53.181 --> 1:30:56.619
I should've been
upfront with you
from the jump.

1:30:56.652 --> 1:30:59.988
It's just hard to understand
that you didn't wanna
hear my words from me.

1:31:00.022 --> 1:31:02.758
You wanted the hot guy
and the hot music
all at the same time.

1:31:02.791 --> 1:31:07.830
Wrong, Cyrus.
It wasn't about his looks.

1:31:07.863 --> 1:31:11.634
I fell in love with his...
I mean, your words.

1:31:13.101 --> 1:31:16.071
I just wanted someone
who was real,

1:31:16.104 --> 1:31:19.508
but now it's clear
that that's neither
one of you.

1:31:19.542 --> 1:31:21.610
So both of you
just stay out of my life.

1:31:22.711 --> 1:31:24.780
Hey, where you going?

1:31:24.813 --> 1:31:26.715
We want you
to present the trophy
to the new champ.

1:31:26.749 --> 1:31:28.984
Thanks, but I'm not
in the mood.

1:31:29.017 --> 1:31:32.988
Why don't
you ask Truth to do it?
This is his night.

1:31:36.859 --> 1:31:38.060
Follow me.

1:31:45.668 --> 1:31:47.803
(CROWD CHEERING)

1:31:47.836 --> 1:31:50.606
All right.
So we've heard
from our finalists.

1:31:50.639 --> 1:31:52.507
But there can only be
one champion.

1:31:54.142 --> 1:31:57.846

Yeah!
Midtown, baby, let's go.
I told you I'm number one!

Our trophy
will now be presented

Oh, man!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Look at this.

Oh, oh, oh, wait,
is it Truth or
is it Baby Ruth?

You know, you don't
deserve this trophy,

1:33:04.747 --> 1:33:06.081
because you're not
the best.

1:33:06.114 --> 1:33:07.983
I mean, you're not
the best in Atlanta,

1:33:08.016 --> 1:33:09.584
you're not even
the best in the building.

1:33:16.291 --> 1:33:19.594

Yo, I'm gonna
love beating you

We have a challenge.
So let the challenge begin!

1:33:37.946 --> 1:33:39.715
You want this battle, huh?

1:33:39.748 --> 1:33:42.818
So you're a rapper now, oh.
Okay.

1:33:46.789 --> 1:33:48.023
* Prepare to meet your end

* Just looked you up
on Facebook

1:33:49.992 --> 1:33:52.260
* You have zero friends
This kid's a loser

1:33:52.294 --> 1:33:55.230
* Yo, he ain't
even kissed a girl
You write her love letters

1:33:55.263 --> 1:33:58.200
* I buy her ice and pearls
So how you like me now?

1:33:58.233 --> 1:34:00.669
* Even Roxanne's
in the background

1:34:00.703 --> 1:34:02.104
* Saying,
"Wow, Bling's got style"

1:34:02.137 --> 1:34:04.072
* I'm off the gold chain

1:34:04.106 --> 1:34:06.041
* If you're a rapper
why is Kris your
backup dancer

1:34:06.074 --> 1:34:08.376
* Like an extra
on Soul Train?

1:34:08.410 --> 1:34:10.913
* I see your
mommy and your daddy
in the front row

1:34:10.946 --> 1:34:12.915
* They must be
embarrassed for you, bro

1:34:12.948 --> 1:34:16.051
* You're not a real MC
You should quit hip-hop

1:34:16.084 --> 1:34:18.921
* Now be a good busboy
and go get your mop

1:34:18.954 --> 1:34:20.022
(RAPPING)
* Bling, you don't
wanna battle

1:34:20.055 --> 1:34:21.790
* You're the snake
without the rattle

1:34:21.824 --> 1:34:22.858
* You're the boat
without the paddle

1:34:22.891 --> 1:34:24.592
* You're the duck
without the waddle

1:34:24.626 --> 1:34:27.295
* You're the horse
without the saddle
The ranch without the cattle

1:34:27.329 --> 1:34:28.897
* The day
without the shadow

1:34:28.931 --> 1:34:30.098
* Son, I think
you should skedaddle

1:34:30.132 --> 1:34:33.335
* Kick gravel, sayonara,
punk, arrivederci

1:34:33.368 --> 1:34:36.438
* What language
do I have to say it in
for you to hear me clearly?

1:34:36.471 --> 1:34:39.274
* Adios, amigo
You're over with, finito

1:34:39.307 --> 1:34:41.710
* This clown
couldn't wrap anything
but my burrito

1:34:41.744 --> 1:34:43.378
* Kid, you have to hold
your mommy's hand

1:34:43.411 --> 1:34:45.748
* Before you cross the street
You have to sneak out
the house

1:34:45.781 --> 1:34:46.949
* Just to clean and sweep

1:34:46.982 --> 1:34:49.918
* And now you look queasy
I made him go mute

1:34:49.952 --> 1:34:52.921
* Put your camera phones up
so you can post this
on YouTube

1:34:52.955 --> 1:34:55.791
* Truth's got a screw loose
He's terrified to bust

1:34:55.824 --> 1:34:58.326
* So lightweight
that I could blow him
over with a gust

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.229
* You're weak like seven days
You deserve boos

1:35:01.263 --> 1:35:04.232
* You should walk around
in some high-heel shoes, ha!

1:35:04.266 --> 1:35:06.935
* You should rock
pigtails and a skirt

1:35:06.969 --> 1:35:07.970
* You're shaking
in your boots

1:35:08.003 --> 1:35:10.005
* Are your feelings
getting hurt?

1:35:10.038 --> 1:35:12.374
* Well, maybe I should hurt
more than your feelings

1:35:12.407 --> 1:35:15.210
* Maybe I should rip the roof
off the theater ceiling

1:35:15.243 --> 1:35:18.246
* Maybe you should
start kneeling
His eyes are getting misty

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:21.416
* You're so
whack if you were me
you couldn't diss me

1:35:21.449 --> 1:35:24.086
* Kissy-kissy Roxanne,
did you miss me?

1:35:24.119 --> 1:35:27.089
* I'll take you out
for dinner after I've
eaten this pipsqueak

1:35:27.122 --> 1:35:29.925
* And when we're on vacation
I'll let him house sit

1:35:29.958 --> 1:35:32.327
* Here's a couple bucks
Buy yourself
a better outfit

1:35:37.099 --> 1:35:39.167
Get him, Cy.
Come on, Cy.

1:35:42.537 --> 1:35:44.406
You know what?

1:35:44.439 --> 1:35:47.175
* You don't
have a stack of cash
or a flashy pad

1:35:47.209 --> 1:35:50.212
* I saw you last week
driving a taxi cab

1:35:50.245 --> 1:35:52.314
* Your secret's out
and now they know, sport

1:35:52.347 --> 1:35:55.283
* We'll call you
if we need a ride
to an airport

1:35:55.317 --> 1:35:58.153
* In fact, you can drop me
off at home after this

1:35:58.186 --> 1:36:01.289
* Then you can take
your couple bucks back,
but as a tip

1:36:01.323 --> 1:36:03.558
* You're playin'
yourself like solitaire

1:36:03.591 --> 1:36:06.461
* Tellin' everyone
that's here that you're
a millionaire

1:36:06.494 --> 1:36:08.463
* You're not a baller,
you're a phony

1:36:08.496 --> 1:36:11.800
* I bet your whole crew
is a bunch of rent-a-homies

1:36:11.834 --> 1:36:14.903
* At night
you lie in bed lonely
Your persona's a facade

1:36:14.937 --> 1:36:18.140
* The only girls you get
are in the pages
of a catalog

1:36:18.173 --> 1:36:20.275
* Here stands
Lord of Da Bluff

1:36:20.308 --> 1:36:23.445
* His lies were legendary
till the Truth made him hush

1:36:23.478 --> 1:36:26.381
* And what's funny
is your truth is enough

1:36:26.414 --> 1:36:29.017
* Why'd you have to make up
all the money and the stuff

1:36:29.051 --> 1:36:31.820
* I guess it's easier to
play the role and act hard

1:36:31.854 --> 1:36:35.057
* 'Cause you don't
have the guts to tell us
who you really are

1:36:35.090 --> 1:36:37.392
* So you can keep a trophy
that you don't deserve

1:36:37.425 --> 1:36:40.328
* I might just be a busboy,
but you just got served *

(LAUGHING)

1:36:54.176 --> 1:36:55.277
Sorry, man.

1:36:55.310 --> 1:36:57.612
Get out, man.
Man, whatever, man.

1:36:57.645 --> 1:37:01.049
We have a new
Grand Slam Champion.

1:37:01.083 --> 1:37:05.320
Truth! Truth! Truth!
Truth! Truth! Truth!

1:37:23.471 --> 1:37:24.472
Roxie, please, wait.

1:37:31.246 --> 1:37:33.115
Roxie. Come on,
just open up.

1:37:33.148 --> 1:37:35.517
Just give me
a minute, please.
All right?

1:37:35.550 --> 1:37:37.552
What?
Look, you got one minute,

1:37:37.585 --> 1:37:40.188
and I've gotta go
or I'll miss my flight.

1:37:40.222 --> 1:37:43.992
Look, Roxie, I am sorry.
All right?

1:37:44.026 --> 1:37:48.897
Cyrus and I, we never
meant to hurt you.
He did it for me.

1:37:48.931 --> 1:37:52.034
I saw you looking all fine
and I thought that we'd
be great together.

1:37:52.067 --> 1:37:54.336
Just like when you saw
that picture with
me and Cyrus in it?

1:37:54.369 --> 1:37:55.603
You thought
I was the rapper

1:37:55.637 --> 1:37:56.404
and he was, like,
my roadie or something.

1:37:59.141 --> 1:38:02.978
He's not wrong.
It's show business.

1:38:03.011 --> 1:38:05.513
I was the one who asked Cyrus
to help me trick you.

1:38:05.547 --> 1:38:08.283
And he saw you feeling me
and me feeling you

1:38:08.316 --> 1:38:09.551
and he just wanted to do
what was right, you know?

1:38:11.486 --> 1:38:14.089
Of course,
then I started feeling
every girl in Atlanta.

1:38:14.122 --> 1:38:16.258
Yeah.

1:38:16.291 --> 1:38:19.962
But if it is the real
that you were looking for,

1:38:19.995 --> 1:38:21.563
that's you and Cyrus.
All right?

1:38:21.596 --> 1:38:23.531
And you know that
as much as I do.

1:38:24.666 --> 1:38:26.334
We gotta go.

1:38:26.368 --> 1:38:27.435
I gotta go, Kris.

1:38:27.469 --> 1:38:29.537
Roxie, wait! Please!

1:38:41.116 --> 1:38:42.050
KRIS: Cyrus.

1:38:43.651 --> 1:38:45.320
Kris?
Kris!

1:38:45.353 --> 1:38:48.056
How you doing, Mrs. Debarge?
Reverend.

1:38:48.090 --> 1:38:50.125
Do you mind if I
join you all today?

1:38:50.158 --> 1:38:52.460
I hear you're doing
some powerful preaching, sir.

1:38:52.494 --> 1:38:56.464
Cyrus, Son, it's time
to celebrate and be glad,

1:38:56.498 --> 1:39:00.335
'cause this
brother of yours was lost
and now he's found. (LAUGHS)

1:39:01.736 --> 1:39:02.637
Yes.

1:39:25.727 --> 1:39:28.296
Cyrus Debarge,

1:39:28.330 --> 1:39:29.497
I don't know
if you remember me,

1:39:29.531 --> 1:39:31.466
but we went
to school together.

1:39:31.499 --> 1:39:35.670
Sure, I do. Roxanne Andrews.
Nice to see you again.
