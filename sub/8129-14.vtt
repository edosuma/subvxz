WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.470
? Boy, the way Glenn Miller played ?

00:05.537 --> 00:09.140
? songs that made the hit parade ?

00:09.208 --> 00:12.811
? guys like us, we had it made ?

00:12.878 --> 00:16.414
? those were the days

00:16.482 --> 00:19.951
<i>? and you knew</i> <i>where you were then ?</i>

00:19.953 --> 00:23.654
<i>? girls were girls</i> <i>and men were men ?</i>

00:23.722 --> 00:26.491
<i>(Both)</i> <i>? mister, we could use a man</i>

00:33.232 --> 00:36.234

00:36.302 --> 00:40.605
<i>(Both)</i> <i>? gee, our old lasalle</i> <i>ran great ?</i>

? those were

00:42.241 --> 00:45.377
? the days

00:53.052 --> 00:54.552
? [humming]

00:55.988 --> 01:00.859
Oh, my! I just saw the
saddest thing on T.V.

01:00.926 --> 01:03.228
What was it, ma? New comedy show?

01:04.029 --> 01:06.931
Oh, no, it was a drama.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.134
All about a young couple

01:09.201 --> 01:14.305
whose car gets stuck in the desert,
and they're dyin' of thirst.

01:14.373 --> 01:16.340
Yeah? What happened to 'em?

01:16.408 --> 01:19.310
Well, in the beginning you
see this young couple

01:19.378 --> 01:21.846
packing up to take an automobile trip

01:21.914 --> 01:24.249
way across the country.

01:24.316 --> 01:25.917
And they get in the car,

01:25.985 --> 01:29.153
and they start off, and
then there's a commercial.

01:29.221 --> 01:32.156
And in the commercial there's
a couple, only they're older

01:32.224 --> 01:34.125
and they are takin' a trip, too.

01:34.193 --> 01:36.861
But then their trip is
across the ocean-- ma!

01:36.929 --> 01:39.864
Ma, ma, ma, m-Michael's friend
Stuart is gonna be here pretty soon,

01:39.932 --> 01:41.499
and I'm really in kind of a hurry

01:41.567 --> 01:43.635
so why don't you start from the end?

01:44.637 --> 01:46.538
Oh. All right.

01:48.474 --> 01:51.142
Since they're runnin' out of water

01:51.210 --> 01:55.580
the husband walks off
into the desert at night

01:55.648 --> 01:59.150
so his wife can have
another day to get saved.

01:59.852 --> 02:01.719
Which she does get.

02:03.555 --> 02:05.056
Saved? Yeah.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.292
Ah, and do they find the husband? Yeah.

02:07.359 --> 02:08.559
Ah, good.

02:08.627 --> 02:09.728
He was dead.

02:12.498 --> 02:14.632
It ain't many husbands

02:14.700 --> 02:19.437
who would give up his life
so his wife can live.

02:19.505 --> 02:20.438
Ma,

02:21.606 --> 02:24.509
do you think Michael would die for me?

02:24.577 --> 02:27.445
Oh, sure, Mike is very thoughtful.

02:29.615 --> 02:31.182
Hi, ma. (Edith) Hi.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.783
Hi, honey. Hi, honey.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.586
Mmm, good stuff.

02:34.653 --> 02:35.820
Tell your friends where you got it.

02:35.887 --> 02:37.288
[Laughs]

02:37.356 --> 02:38.890
Got any stuff in the
refrigerator for sandwiches?

02:38.958 --> 02:40.892
I had a late class, I
didn't get a chance to eat.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.560
Mike, I'll fix you something.

02:42.628 --> 02:44.095
No, that's all right, ma. I'll do it.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.597
I better hurry, though. Stuart
will be here any minute.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.034
Stuart is very smart, ain't he?

02:49.101 --> 02:50.769
What is he studying to be?

02:50.836 --> 02:52.536
Uh, doctor of philosophy.

02:52.604 --> 02:54.338
Oh, yeah.

02:54.406 --> 02:58.342
That's one of them doctors that
don't give prescriptions, right?

02:59.744 --> 03:01.813
Yeah, tha-that's right, ma.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.314
He's really got some mind.

03:03.382 --> 03:04.849
He's got one of those rare brains

03:04.917 --> 03:06.417
you don't come across too often.

03:06.485 --> 03:09.420
Mmm, is he as smart as you?

03:09.488 --> 03:12.257
Yeah, I'd put him in my class.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.458
I'm glad your friend Stuart
can make it over tonight.

03:14.526 --> 03:15.894
Be nice to have some company.

03:15.961 --> 03:17.762
Yeah, be nice to sit around
and have a conversation

03:17.830 --> 03:19.230
with somebody who has a real intellect.

03:19.298 --> 03:24.736
Oh, my! It's gonna be just
like <i>the merv Griffin show.</i>

03:24.970 --> 03:28.072
Oh, no, Mike. Those nuts
and raisins are for later

03:28.140 --> 03:29.807
when you're playin' chess.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.176
Oh, you can eat that one now.

03:32.244 --> 03:34.979
Just think, 2 college boys.

03:35.047 --> 03:38.583
Oh, the house is gonna be
full of brains tonight.

03:39.718 --> 03:40.851
Michael.

03:40.919 --> 03:41.953
Yeah.

03:43.222 --> 03:44.656
Do you love me?

03:44.724 --> 03:45.824
Yeah.

03:47.092 --> 03:49.294
Would you give up your life for me?

03:49.362 --> 03:50.995
Right after I finish this sandwich.

03:52.531 --> 03:54.799
No, honey. Ma saw this movie on T.V.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.634
It takes place in this desert,

03:56.702 --> 03:59.537
where this husband gives up his
life so his wife can live,

03:59.605 --> 04:02.407
and I was just wondering if
you would do the same for me.

04:02.474 --> 04:07.077
Sure, honey. If we're ever in the Sahara
desert together, you got my life.

04:07.145 --> 04:08.579
We got any pickles?

04:09.281 --> 04:10.581
Michael, I'm serious.

04:10.649 --> 04:11.916
Yeah, we got some.

04:13.151 --> 04:15.986
I mean, I-I-if we were
stranded in the desert

04:16.053 --> 04:19.723
and we had just enough water for
one of us, what would you do?

04:19.791 --> 04:22.227
I'd flip you for it.

04:22.294 --> 04:23.828
Oh, honey, what do you want from me?

04:23.896 --> 04:25.530
That's a very tough question to answer.

04:25.597 --> 04:28.632
Not many people know how they'd
react in a life-or-death situation.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.735
Ok, forget the desert.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.469
Let's say we're out in the ocean

04:32.537 --> 04:34.806
and there's this shark coming at us.

04:34.873 --> 04:37.541
Would you swim in front
of his teeth to save me?

04:37.609 --> 04:39.077
How big is the shark?

04:40.179 --> 04:41.912
Oh, he's-- he's big, he's very big.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.914
He's a man-eating shark.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.550
Well, then, maybe you should
swim in front of it to save me.

04:47.352 --> 04:48.452
Why?

04:48.520 --> 04:49.753
'Cause it's a man-eating shark.

04:56.328 --> 04:58.429
You didn't say woman-eating shark.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.968
I'm just trying to find out
how much you care for me.

05:04.036 --> 05:06.370
I care for you, honey. I care for you.

05:06.438 --> 05:08.106
If you care for me, you'll let me finish

05:08.173 --> 05:09.774
this sandwich before Stuart gets here.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.076
Michael! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

05:12.144 --> 05:14.412
Michael, we are lost in the mountains.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.147
Now we're in the mountains.

05:16.215 --> 05:17.715
This is our only food.

05:17.783 --> 05:19.150
Our only chance for survival.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.386
Would you give me this sandwich?

05:21.454 --> 05:24.556
I wouldn't have to. You'd take it from me.

05:24.623 --> 05:26.657
Would you give me the sandwich back? No!

05:26.725 --> 05:28.393
Oh, come on, don't run around.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.961
Mike, no! I want a
straight answer from you.

05:30.028 --> 05:32.196
Honey, wait, that's my dinner.
Will you quit foolin' around?

05:32.264 --> 05:35.066
Michael, I just want to hear you say
you'd give up your life for me.

05:35.134 --> 05:36.568
Would you say it? Give me the sandwich.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.637
[Screaming] Ma! Give me that sandwich!

05:39.705 --> 05:42.440
Just say the words. Just say
you'd lay down your life for me.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.176
It's ridiculous. How did we
get into this conversation.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.811
Oh, say the words, Michael. Say the words.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.145
All right. All right.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.848
I'd lay down my life for you.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.417
You would? Yes!

05:52.485 --> 05:54.652
I'd give you the food. I'd
give you the water...

05:54.719 --> 05:55.953
Oh, what about the shark?

05:56.021 --> 05:58.389
I'd give you the shark.

05:58.457 --> 06:01.525
I didn't mean that. I--I--I
meant I'd let the shark eat me.

06:01.593 --> 06:02.927
All right, you happy?

06:02.995 --> 06:04.462
Can I have my sandwich back please?

06:04.530 --> 06:05.696
Yeah, here.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.502
That's nice. That's real nice.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.971
Oh, Mike, I'll fix you another sandwich.

06:14.039 --> 06:15.106
[Doorbell ringing]

06:15.173 --> 06:16.207
Oh, I'll get it.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.408
It's probably Stuart.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.944
Oh.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.045
Hi. I'm Stuart Henderson.

06:21.113 --> 06:24.148
Oh, yeah, Mike's friend. How do you do?

06:24.216 --> 06:27.284
Sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt your, uh, dinner?

06:27.352 --> 06:30.688
Oh, no. This ain't my dinner. It's Mike's.

06:31.524 --> 06:32.857
Well, come on in.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.626
Hey, how are you doing, Stuart.
Nice to see you.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.093
Hey, Mike, how are you? Good to see you.

06:36.161 --> 06:37.962
Excuse me. I'll get the coffee.

06:38.030 --> 06:41.198
Oh, thanks, ma. Uh, that's my mother-in-law,
and, uh, this is my wife, Gloria.

06:41.266 --> 06:42.800
Stuart Henderson. Hi, Gloria, how are you?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.502
Hi, Stuart. Stuart, why
don't we sit over here?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.937
I've got the chess set out. We can--

06:46.005 --> 06:49.206
hey, Gloria, listen. I don't
mean to embarrass you,

06:49.274 --> 06:52.610
but, uh, you know, you're every bit as
beautiful as Michael said you were.

06:52.677 --> 06:55.946
Oh, please. Embarrass me.

06:56.014 --> 06:58.550
Stuart, remember in our
philo 500 class last week

06:58.617 --> 07:00.552
somebody brought up the
question, "what is beauty?"

07:00.619 --> 07:02.019
You mean whether the answer

07:02.087 --> 07:03.388
is to be found in psychology or philosophy?

07:03.689 --> 07:05.256
Right. And that guy agreed with santayana

07:05.324 --> 07:06.924
that beauty is pleasure objectified,

07:06.991 --> 07:08.859
but I don't know, I like what spinoza said:

07:08.927 --> 07:11.696
"Beauty is anything that meets the
fundamental needs of our nature."

07:11.763 --> 07:15.099
When I was 14, I thought the
Beatles' hair was beautiful.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.501
Now, listen, a lot of
people think-- oh, yeah?

07:17.569 --> 07:19.536
Uh, honey, honey, why don't
you go in the kitchen

07:19.605 --> 07:23.107
and see if ma needs any help with
the coffee and cookies, huh?

07:23.242 --> 07:24.675
Ok, Michael. Yeah, thanks a lot.

07:24.743 --> 07:26.877
Hey, sit--sit down over here, Stuart.

07:29.047 --> 07:30.315
Need any help, ma?

07:30.382 --> 07:31.683
No, thanks.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.884
Is anything wrong?

07:33.952 --> 07:37.121
Oh, I don't know. We were just
talking about how beautiful I am

07:37.189 --> 07:40.091
and then suddenly I got kicked out.

07:40.158 --> 07:43.861
Oh, well, maybe they're just
2 college boys talking.

07:43.929 --> 07:45.730
You remember what Mike said?

07:45.798 --> 07:49.500
He likes to talk to
somebody real intelligent.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.703
Oh, that's not what he said, ma.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.004
Better not be.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.174
Stuart, you have to admit

07:57.242 --> 08:00.612
that the sense of hearing does have
some aesthetic value for animals.

08:00.679 --> 08:04.582
Havelock Ellis wrote about a--a
tiger who was pacified by a violin.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.417
Yeah, but only for certain sounds.

08:06.485 --> 08:10.354
You know, that same tiger was
infuriated by the sound of a piccolo.

08:10.422 --> 08:11.956
That's right. That's right. I guess, yeah.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.958
It's-- it's the softer,
sweeter sounds they go for.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.460
Like violins or flutes. Yeah.

08:15.527 --> 08:17.761
A-a-and I guess that's why they say:

08:17.829 --> 08:21.299
"Music hath charms to
soothe savage beast," huh?

08:21.367 --> 08:22.833
Uh, breast.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.002
Huh?

08:24.069 --> 08:25.069
Breast.

08:25.437 --> 08:26.637
Oh.

08:26.705 --> 08:29.007
"Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast."

08:29.074 --> 08:30.308
Not beast. Oh.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.277
Lot of people make that mistake.

08:32.344 --> 08:35.179
Uh, lets see. The exact quote is:

08:35.246 --> 08:38.750
"Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast,

08:38.817 --> 08:40.485
"to soften rocks,

08:40.552 --> 08:42.886
or bend a knotted tree."

08:42.955 --> 08:43.754
Oak.

08:46.891 --> 08:47.958
Huh?

08:48.026 --> 08:49.994
"Bend a knotted oak."

08:49.996 --> 08:52.396
A lot of people make that mistake, Michael.

08:55.534 --> 08:56.734
Let's play chess, huh?

08:56.802 --> 08:58.235
Listen, uh,

08:58.303 --> 09:00.604
why don't we do something
we can all do, huh?

09:00.672 --> 09:02.340
Yeah, why don't we play charades? Great.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.941
No, no, no, I don't want to play charades.

09:04.009 --> 09:06.744
Uh, honey, you know, Stuart
and I would love some coffee.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.146
If it's ready, could you
go get us some, please?

09:09.548 --> 09:10.682
Uh,

09:10.749 --> 09:11.749
ok, Michael.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.418
Yeah, thank you very much, dear.

09:15.453 --> 09:16.954
He did it again, ma.

09:17.022 --> 09:18.055
Did what?

09:18.123 --> 09:19.356
Sent me out of the room.

09:19.424 --> 09:20.557
Why?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.459
Because I didn't say breast.

09:26.431 --> 09:28.999
If they're talkin' about things like that--

09:29.067 --> 09:31.469
oh, no, ma. It's just that Michael's

09:31.536 --> 09:33.971
tryin' to hog the whole
evening, that's all.

09:34.038 --> 09:35.740
Oh, Gloria.

09:35.807 --> 09:38.242
Stuart is one of Mike's best friends.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.544
Well, I'm one of his best wives.

09:40.612 --> 09:44.581
And I don't like being sent out of
the room every time I open my mouth.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.951
Well, there ain't nothin' wrong
in bein' a good listener.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.689
Archie says that's what makes a good wife.

09:51.756 --> 09:54.625
I don't wanna be that kind of wife.

09:54.692 --> 09:56.561
There are 2 ways of studying man.

09:56.628 --> 09:58.929
One starts with the environment
and deals with man

09:58.997 --> 10:00.864
as a mechanism of adjustment.

10:00.932 --> 10:01.965
Coffee's on.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.167
Yeah, thank you.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.502
Uh, of course this theory reduces thoughts,

10:04.570 --> 10:06.304
to things in mind to matter.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.206
Uh, Mike. Look, uh, Gloria
said something about

10:08.273 --> 10:10.007
playing charades. How about it, huh?

10:10.075 --> 10:11.442
No, no, no. I don't want to play charades.

10:11.509 --> 10:12.543
Yeah. I'll start.

10:12.610 --> 10:13.677
No, no, no, no.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.879
Come on, come on. Just a couple.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.982
All right, just one. We'll play one
charade and that's it, all right?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.817
Ok, uh...

10:20.886 --> 10:22.553
Uh, movie. It's a movie.

10:24.456 --> 10:26.190
4 words. 4 words.

10:28.694 --> 10:29.760
You're gonna do the whole thing.

10:29.828 --> 10:31.229
You're gonna do the whole thing.

10:33.531 --> 10:34.999
[Blowing]

10:35.066 --> 10:36.533
"Whistling." "Whistling."

10:38.703 --> 10:40.671
"Blowing." "Blowing. Blowing."

10:40.739 --> 10:41.973
[Whooshing]

10:42.041 --> 10:44.308
"Blowing, blowing..."

10:45.077 --> 10:46.344
She left the room.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.881
Did he kick you out again?

10:51.116 --> 10:53.384
No, ma. Charades.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.052
Oh.

10:55.119 --> 10:57.088
Uh, <i>"gone with the wind."</i> <i>(Gloria)</i> <i>Right.</i>

10:57.156 --> 10:58.523
<i>"Gone with the wind."</i>

10:58.590 --> 11:00.358
Yeah. Hey, that's great. Terrific, Gloria.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.227
Really terrific. I wonder what Freud
would have said about charades.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.962
Well, knowing Freud, he'd probably think

11:05.030 --> 11:06.964
it was a way of acting
out sexual fantasies.

11:07.032 --> 11:09.967
Oh, boy, that Freud. Everything
with him was sex, wasn't it?

11:10.035 --> 11:12.970
He probably would have thought
goldilocks was a nymphomaniac,

11:13.038 --> 11:15.139
'cause she liked to sleep
in different beds.

11:18.477 --> 11:21.178
Aha. Then you must agree with adler.

11:21.246 --> 11:22.914
I don't know. Who's adler?

11:22.981 --> 11:25.950
Uh, uh, honey, it's a
little bit complicated.

11:26.017 --> 11:27.618
Um, I'll explain it to you later.

11:27.686 --> 11:30.755
Why don't you go check on the cookies, huh?

11:30.823 --> 11:34.358
Um, ok, Michael. But just
one more charade, ok?

11:34.426 --> 11:35.860
No, no, no, no. No more charades.

11:35.928 --> 11:36.961
(Stuart) Oh, come on. Just one more.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.629
It'll only take a minute, ok?

11:38.697 --> 11:39.864
Oh, come on. Just one more.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.265
All right, one more. Go ahead. One more.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.266
But that's it. (Gloria) Ok.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.202
No more charades after this.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.570
Go ahead. It's 2 words.

11:47.439 --> 11:49.040
The first word is what?

11:49.107 --> 11:50.040
Uh, "push."

11:50.175 --> 11:51.876
It's "pushing," it's, uh, "shoving."

11:51.943 --> 11:55.246
It's "shove. Shove, shove, shove."

11:55.314 --> 11:57.648
Second word is what? It's a small word...

11:57.715 --> 11:59.150
(Stuart) "And." It's "the."

11:59.217 --> 12:00.884
It's "but." It's "and."

12:00.952 --> 12:02.086
It's "it."

12:02.954 --> 12:03.888
"Shove it!"

12:05.000 --> 12:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:21.039 --> 12:22.540
Excuse me, Stuart.

12:41.059 --> 12:43.594
What were you trying to
pull down there, Gloria?

12:43.661 --> 12:45.229
Gloria, isn't here.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.598
Huh? This is your dog, rover.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.033
Fetch the cookies, Gloria.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.133
Fetch the coffee.

12:50.201 --> 12:52.169
[Yipping]

12:52.237 --> 12:53.938
What do you want me to fetch next, master?

12:54.005 --> 12:55.105
Your dead duck?

12:55.173 --> 12:56.440
[Panting]

12:57.709 --> 12:58.843
What are you doing?

12:58.910 --> 13:00.010
[Yelping]

13:00.078 --> 13:01.178
Oh, come on!

13:01.246 --> 13:02.713
Gee! What's the matter with you?

13:02.781 --> 13:04.215
You flip out or somethin'?

13:04.316 --> 13:05.483
Yeah.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.951
Don't you realize what you
were doing to me down there?

13:08.019 --> 13:10.321
You were either ordering
me to get you something,

13:10.389 --> 13:12.089
or to sit down and be quiet.

13:12.157 --> 13:13.023
That's not true.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.926
Yes, it is.

13:14.993 --> 13:17.828
You made me feel this big in front
of Stuart, inferring I was dumb.

13:17.896 --> 13:18.762
Implying.

13:18.830 --> 13:19.830
Huh?

13:21.233 --> 13:22.466
See, the listener infers,

13:22.534 --> 13:24.368
the speaker implies.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.103
Oh, I did it again, huh?

13:26.171 --> 13:27.004
[Tittering] Oh.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.611
How could you marry anyone
with such a small mind?

13:33.678 --> 13:35.713
I don't think you have a small mind.

13:37.282 --> 13:39.450
I was talking to myself, you egotist.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.927
You got back at me. You gave me a shot.
You happy now?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.863
No. Because you still don't
understand what I'm talking about.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.933
Yes, I do. You want to feel
a part of things, right?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.034
Yes!

13:57.102 --> 13:58.702
Ok. Why don't you come downstairs,

13:58.770 --> 14:00.771
you can watch Stuart and me play chess.

14:00.838 --> 14:03.406
Oh. Whoop-di-doo!

14:03.474 --> 14:05.542
Gloria, that's the best
way to learn the moves.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.544
You watch 2 experts play.

14:07.612 --> 14:10.280
Well, then I've got a good
move for you, Michael.

14:10.348 --> 14:12.249
Why don't you get out?

14:12.316 --> 14:13.383
Oh, honey come on.

14:13.451 --> 14:14.885
I said out!

14:14.953 --> 14:16.253
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.155
I didn't mean to interrupt you,

14:18.223 --> 14:20.190
but Stuart is downstairs--

14:20.258 --> 14:21.926
I was just on my way down, ma.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.195
Maybe you can talk some sense to her.
Excuse me.

14:26.798 --> 14:29.066
Gloria.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.268
What's the matter?

14:31.336 --> 14:32.836
Nothing.

14:32.904 --> 14:35.539
I'm just losing my husband. That's all.

14:35.607 --> 14:38.943
Oh, what makes you think that?

14:39.010 --> 14:41.311
I don't stimulate him anymore.

14:41.379 --> 14:42.579
What?

14:44.182 --> 14:46.450
I mean mentally, ma.

14:46.852 --> 14:47.852
Oh.

14:49.521 --> 14:53.257
While he's at school
studying Sigmund Freud,

14:53.324 --> 14:56.293
I'm behind the cosmetic
counter at kressler's,

14:56.361 --> 14:58.863
selling milk baths to fat cows.

15:00.965 --> 15:04.167
Don't you want Mike to
get his master's degree?

15:04.235 --> 15:06.737
I don't know anymore.

15:06.805 --> 15:10.474
I'm busy working his way through
school and my way out of a marriage.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.611
Oh, Gloria, it couldn't be that bad.

15:13.678 --> 15:15.846
Oh, it is, ma. Don't you see?

15:15.914 --> 15:17.882
The more and more educated he gets,

15:17.949 --> 15:19.517
the more he's gonna need a woman

15:19.584 --> 15:21.886
whose got it all up here,
not someplace else.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.290
You've got just as much up there

15:26.357 --> 15:28.225
as you've got someplace else.

15:32.531 --> 15:37.735
Some men think that women who got it
someplace else, ain't got it up here.

15:37.803 --> 15:42.072
But I know a lot of women who got
it up here and someplace else.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.607
Ma--

15:43.675 --> 15:45.609
I know some women who got it up here

15:45.677 --> 15:48.211
and don't got it someplace else.

15:48.279 --> 15:51.982
Ma-- and I know some women who had it up

15:52.050 --> 15:53.517
someplace else.

15:54.719 --> 15:57.254
And when they got older, it moved.

16:04.162 --> 16:07.564
Oh, ma. You don't understand at all.

16:07.632 --> 16:10.834
Don't you see? I'm not
smart enough for Michael.

16:10.902 --> 16:13.571
Gloria, you should never talk like that.

16:13.638 --> 16:16.039
There's lots of ways of bein' smart.

16:16.107 --> 16:18.876
There's book smart, and
there's people smart.

16:18.943 --> 16:23.180
And sometimes people smart
is a lot more important.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.882
Michael doesn't think so.

16:24.949 --> 16:28.085
Hmm, well, neither does Archie.

16:28.152 --> 16:31.555
But that's the way we got this house.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.757
What do you mean?

16:32.824 --> 16:35.025
Well, when we wanted to buy it,

16:35.093 --> 16:36.894
it cost more than we could afford.

16:36.961 --> 16:40.364
But Archie said that we could
bargain the price down

16:40.432 --> 16:42.633
if we worked like a team.

16:42.700 --> 16:43.500
Like how?

16:43.568 --> 16:46.169
Well, Archie would do the talkin' part

16:46.237 --> 16:49.105
and I would do the keepin' quiet part.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.079
But Archie made the owner mad.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.982
And the man said he wouldn't
sell the house to Archie

16:58.049 --> 17:00.384
if he was the last man on earth.

17:00.451 --> 17:02.019
M-ma, I'm sorry,

17:02.153 --> 17:04.954
but I don't see what any of this
has got to do with Michael and me.

17:05.022 --> 17:08.625
But it has. This is where
the people smart comes in.

17:08.693 --> 17:11.228
You see, I took the owner aside

17:11.296 --> 17:13.297
and I told him how I felt.

17:13.364 --> 17:15.665
How I liked the house.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.502
How I could feel all the warmness in it

17:18.569 --> 17:20.704
from livin' in the house

17:20.771 --> 17:24.074
with his lovely wife, and
his cute little kids.

17:24.142 --> 17:25.541
And guess what?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.844
The man said we could have the house

17:27.912 --> 17:29.713
in spite of...

17:29.780 --> 17:31.214
In spite of daddy?

17:31.249 --> 17:33.617
Oh, no. In spite of the
owner was a bachelor.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.558
You see, the man liked the way I talked.

17:40.625 --> 17:44.261
But I didn't tell Archie it
was me that got the house.

17:44.329 --> 17:47.030
I let Archie think that he did it.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.165
Well, I don't think that's right.

17:49.233 --> 17:52.970
A smart wife shouldn't be afraid
to show her husband she is

17:53.037 --> 17:54.137
smart.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.240
Tonight,

17:57.308 --> 17:59.543
I'm feelin' pretty inferior.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.946
Ma, what am I gonna do?

18:03.014 --> 18:05.015
Oh, Gloria.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.185
Why don't you do what you always do?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.586
Talk to Mike

18:09.654 --> 18:12.289
and tell him how you feel.

18:13.257 --> 18:14.958
Yeah, I suppose I should.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.560
[Sighs]

18:17.428 --> 18:19.696
Yeah. You're right.

18:19.764 --> 18:21.132
Yeah.

18:21.199 --> 18:22.566
Hey, I'm not a second-class citizen

18:22.634 --> 18:24.735
just because I didn't go to college.

18:24.802 --> 18:27.170
And I'm gonna go down there
and tell him, right now.

18:27.238 --> 18:28.405
Good.

18:28.473 --> 18:29.473
Yeah, he's gonna have to

18:29.541 --> 18:32.376
either accept me the way I
am, or find somebody else.

18:35.713 --> 18:37.414
What's the matter?

18:41.619 --> 18:44.288
What if he finds somebody else.

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
Checkmate.

18:52.597 --> 18:54.431
I didn't even see that.

18:54.499 --> 18:56.033
That's the 3rd time you didn't see it.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.468
Let's call it a night. Ok, Mike?

18:57.536 --> 18:59.102
No, no, no, no. Let's play one more.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.271
I want to win one. Just one.

19:01.339 --> 19:02.840
Mike, I haven't got that much time.

19:02.907 --> 19:04.474
I'm already 27 years old.

19:06.444 --> 19:07.711
Am I that bad?

19:07.779 --> 19:09.513
Hey, Mike, forget it, will you?

19:09.581 --> 19:12.048
No, no, re-really, tell
me-- tell me, how bad am I?

19:12.050 --> 19:13.650
Ok. You're terrible.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.019
Seriously.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.489
Oh, seriously, you're the worst.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.659
Why would you want to play with me?

19:22.727 --> 19:24.795
I didn't. You made me play.

19:24.862 --> 19:25.996
Listen, it's getting late, Mike.

19:26.063 --> 19:27.664
Oh, w-wait a second. Wait a second, stu.

19:27.732 --> 19:29.199
What do you mean I made you play?

19:29.267 --> 19:30.801
I--I thought you liked to play chess.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.169
I do. And I wish we had
played some tonight.

19:34.171 --> 19:35.839
Oh, come on, Mike.

19:35.907 --> 19:38.709
I was perfectly happy playing
charades with Gloria.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.377
Yeah, but that doesn't take any thought.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.879
Look, Mike, who has to be
thinking all the time?

19:42.947 --> 19:45.148
Hey, look, all night long
you've been coming on like,

19:45.217 --> 19:47.618
"hey, here we are guys. A
couple of intellectuals."

19:47.686 --> 19:49.086
Hey, well, I don't know about you,

19:49.153 --> 19:50.921
but I like to think I'm
more than just that.

19:50.988 --> 19:52.523
Now look, you're a fun guy.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.458
You know the best time I ever had with you

19:54.526 --> 19:57.528
was the night that we went bowling
and you beat me, remember?

19:57.596 --> 20:00.764
145 to 137.

20:00.831 --> 20:03.767
That's right. So what do you say
we do it again sometime, ok?

20:04.635 --> 20:06.036
All right. Ok.

20:06.103 --> 20:07.303
I'll see you in class.

20:07.371 --> 20:08.905
All right, see you later, Stuart.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.714
Michael, we have to have a talk.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.051
Not now. Now.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.953
Our marriage is in trouble.

20:23.021 --> 20:26.290
When one partner thinks of the
other as intellectually inferior--

20:26.357 --> 20:30.060
oh, oh, oh, yes! Sure. Sure.
Hey, that's-- that's great!

20:30.128 --> 20:33.263
First Stuart calls me a dope
. And now you're calling me one.

20:33.331 --> 20:34.765
I didn't call you a dope.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.667
No, but that's what you
were thinkin', Gloria.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.201
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

20:38.269 --> 20:42.973
Chess, chess is not the be all
and end all of everything.

20:43.041 --> 20:46.143
There are a lot of brilliant
guys who can't play chess.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.178
Bowling is important, too.

20:53.317 --> 20:55.285
What are you talkin' about?

20:55.353 --> 20:57.487
You know damn well what I'm
talkin' about, Gloria.

20:57.555 --> 21:00.024
I'm talkin' about you callin'
me intellectually inferior.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.358
I wasn't talkin' about you.
I was talkin' about me.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.193
I'm the dope!

21:06.431 --> 21:07.431
Oh.

21:10.568 --> 21:12.002
Well, then that's all right.

21:13.204 --> 21:14.404
All right?

21:14.472 --> 21:16.206
I didn't mean it that way, honey.

21:16.274 --> 21:17.875
You--you're very bright.

21:17.942 --> 21:20.043
Sure, as long as I stay in the kitchen.

21:20.111 --> 21:22.780
Oh, lets face it, Michael. I'm
just another dumb blonde, right?

21:22.847 --> 21:24.281
No, you're not. You're not.

21:24.348 --> 21:27.384
Honey, you're very, very naturally bright.

21:27.451 --> 21:30.587
There's a big difference between
knowledge and intelligence.

21:30.655 --> 21:33.590
You happen to have in-intelligence.

21:33.658 --> 21:34.825
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

21:34.893 --> 21:36.593
tonight you were smarter than me.

21:36.661 --> 21:37.694
I was?

21:37.762 --> 21:39.062
Yeah.

21:39.130 --> 21:41.898
You were smart enough not
to play chess with Stuart.

21:41.966 --> 21:42.999
Oh, he beat you, huh?

21:43.067 --> 21:44.968
Oh, boy.

21:45.103 --> 21:48.172
Well, I wouldn't care if Stuart
beat you at chess a hundred times.

21:48.239 --> 21:50.807
You're smart enough for me anytime.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.576
It's just that I'm afraid

21:52.643 --> 21:55.579
because you're getting more and
more educated, and I'm not.

21:55.646 --> 21:58.415
And pretty soon you won't need me anymore.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.649
Oh.

21:59.717 --> 22:02.285
Oh, honey. Honey.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.087
Is that what's bothering you?

22:04.722 --> 22:06.022
Hey,

22:06.090 --> 22:08.792
Albert Einstein loved his wife,

22:08.860 --> 22:10.960
and she was a very simple woman.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.632
So now I'm simple, huh?

22:15.700 --> 22:16.466
No! No!

22:16.601 --> 22:19.002
I didn't-- I didn't mean it that way.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.204
Jeez, what are we arguing about?

22:21.272 --> 22:22.772
Because you're getting a masters degree

22:22.840 --> 22:25.041
and I barely finished
high school, that's why.

22:25.109 --> 22:26.843
What? Are you crazy?

22:26.911 --> 22:29.212
What do you think I'm not gonna love
you just because all you have is

22:29.280 --> 22:30.413
a high school education?

22:30.481 --> 22:32.049
[Laughing] Gloria.

22:32.116 --> 22:36.453
You're a warm, wonderful,
sensitive, desirable woman.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.621
I know.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.958
But that's not enough.

22:41.025 --> 22:43.961
When I married you, I married
you because I loved you.

22:44.028 --> 22:45.963
And that has not changed.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.430
But you're changing.

22:47.498 --> 22:51.268
Oh, don't you see, Michael, you're
gonna meet more and more Stuarts.

22:51.336 --> 22:55.038
And then I'm gonna be left out of a
very important part of your life.

22:55.106 --> 22:57.207
And it can only get worse.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.843
Or maybe if I could go to college
things would be different.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.545
I don't know.

23:01.613 --> 23:02.613
[Sobbing]

23:07.385 --> 23:09.319
Then you will.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.688
What do you mean? I can't go to college.

23:11.756 --> 23:13.122
Why not?

23:13.191 --> 23:15.659
You've been helping me through
school these past few years.

23:15.726 --> 23:18.562
When I graduate and get a job,
I'll do the same for you.

23:20.765 --> 23:22.733
You would do that for me?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.067
Sure.

23:24.568 --> 23:25.802
Honey.

23:25.870 --> 23:28.238
<i>Quid pro quo.</i>

23:28.306 --> 23:29.806
That means-- I know what that means.

23:29.874 --> 23:31.207
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.878
It means you love me.

23:36.147 --> 23:37.613
[Gloria crying]

23:39.284 --> 23:40.617
Oh!

23:43.654 --> 23:45.455
What's goin' on here?

23:45.757 --> 23:48.991
Oh, ma. Michael's putting
me through school.

23:49.059 --> 23:51.261
Oh!

23:51.328 --> 23:55.532
Well, don't let me interrupt
you doin' your homework.

23:55.599 --> 23:56.599
[Chuckling]

24:21.892 --> 24:24.127
