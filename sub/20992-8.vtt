WEBVTT

00:12.167 --> 00:13.900
Just clip this on...

00:15.000 --> 00:17.267
Full incline, let's go.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.067
Hey, Thor,
you got a moment?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.267
Yeah.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.567
You see that, uh,
woman over there?

00:22.633 --> 00:24.233
You know that's not
my name, right?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.800
Yeah, I'm not
concerned with that.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.433
She wants you to help her
program the bicycle.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.267
I've showed her how
to do that twice this week.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.333
Hmm, and she wants you
to do it again.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.200
Imagine that?

00:34.267 --> 00:35.467
Imagine what?

00:38.567 --> 00:39.533
I just got a call

00:39.600 --> 00:42.233
from the producer
of "Hour by Hour."

00:43.600 --> 00:44.833
What's that?

00:44.900 --> 00:46.200
Are you kidding?
"Hour by Hour,"

00:46.267 --> 00:47.400
it's the local
news segments show

00:47.467 --> 00:48.800
with the super-hot host.

00:48.867 --> 00:49.800
I-I don't know

00:49.867 --> 00:51.200
about super hot host,

00:51.267 --> 00:52.800
but they want to do a story
on me and the gym.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.467
Huh.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.100
Sweet, I could add
some flavor to that--

00:56.167 --> 00:57.133
No.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.567
Sure, okay.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.300
Any reaction
here, folks?

01:02.367 --> 01:04.167
Steph, don't
stock this stuff,

01:04.233 --> 01:05.200
way too much sugar.

01:05.267 --> 01:06.233
Thanks, Doc.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.167
Yeah, about
"Hour by Hour?"

01:08.233 --> 01:10.067
Oh, that's cool.
Good for business.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.067
Good get, Bro.

01:12.433 --> 01:15.400
A little enthusiasm, please?

01:15.467 --> 01:17.100
I for one, am enthused.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.267
Are you kidding?

01:18.333 --> 01:19.433
This is "Hour by Hour," people!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.833
This is exactly the type
of spontaneous...

01:21.900 --> 01:23.967
publicity I need! Pow!

01:24.067 --> 01:25.400
We need-- we need that...

01:25.467 --> 01:27.300
The Cooper Sports
Institute needs it!

01:27.367 --> 01:28.933
"Hour by Hour" is huge!

01:29.067 --> 01:31.467
"60 Minutes"
is huge, Alan.

01:31.533 --> 01:32.933
"Hour by Hour"?

01:33.067 --> 01:34.867
Not so much.

01:34.933 --> 01:37.533
Good Morning America,
also huge.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.733
Aw!

01:41.067 --> 01:43.767
Aw, you guys
are such jerks, okay?

01:43.833 --> 01:45.867
Any publicity is publicity.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.533
Like Alan said,
it's good for the gym.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.833
And there you have it,

01:49.900 --> 01:50.833
I've agreed with Alan.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.600
I gotta get
this place in order.

01:53.667 --> 01:54.933
We need a face-lift

01:55.067 --> 01:56.867
if we're going to get
a camera crew in here.

01:56.933 --> 02:00.233
Fresh paint, posters,
proper lighting.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.733
-All right l-listen--
-Gotta plan--

02:01.800 --> 02:03.900
No, no,
let's not get crazy.

02:03.967 --> 02:04.967
It's just local TV.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.067
Paige?

02:06.133 --> 02:07.833
-Hey!
-Hi!

02:07.900 --> 02:09.200
Hey!

02:12.700 --> 02:14.800
Um, everyone,
this is Paige.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.333
Paige, this is Bill,
and Alan...

02:16.400 --> 02:18.367
Hi, Paige.
Bill Cooper.

02:18.433 --> 02:19.900
Alan Bajornoff. Hi.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.200
I gotta go look
at paint chips.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.633
Hi, Paige.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.533
I'm Ricky.
Cooper.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.567
Yeah, I got that

02:25.633 --> 02:27.500
from the name
over the entrance

02:27.567 --> 02:29.233
and the posters
on the way in.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.867
Oh, you saw those, too.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.067
Yeah, I'm quick
that way.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.367
Yeah,
well, uh, you know,

02:34.433 --> 02:38.067
I-I've met most of, uh,
Stephanie's friends before,

02:38.100 --> 02:40.367
but, uh, but why
haven't we met?

02:40.433 --> 02:42.400
Oh, I live in Chicago.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.067
I'm just in town
for a couple meetings.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.667
I'm thinking of taking
a consulting gig here.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.433
Ah, so you may stay?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.400
Here? In town?

02:50.467 --> 02:52.567
Well, if I get the job,
that would be the plan.

02:52.633 --> 02:54.433
Commuting every day
from Chicago

02:54.500 --> 02:56.067
might prove tricky.

02:56.067 --> 02:58.333
Tricky Ricky!

02:58.400 --> 02:59.500
That was your nickname.

02:59.567 --> 03:00.533
Yeah.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.067
Tricky Ricky.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.500
Um...

03:03.567 --> 03:04.967
So, is it cool

03:05.067 --> 03:06.867
if I cut out of work
early, boss?

03:06.933 --> 03:07.967
Absolutely.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.067
Yes.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.867
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Paige.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.900
You know, uh,
come work out here

03:12.967 --> 03:13.967
any-any time,
you know?

03:14.067 --> 03:14.833
Tomorrow.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.967
Morning. Maybe.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.500
M-Maybe.
I-if you want.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.333
You know,
we're open at 6:00.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.467
In-in the morning.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.433
A.M.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.467
Tomorrow.

03:22.533 --> 03:23.933
Okay.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.433
I will.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.067
Well, that's settled.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.500
So, we're gonna go.

03:28.567 --> 03:29.800
Okay, I'll-
I'll see you then.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.533
Let's go, Paige.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.067
Bye.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.067
Stutter much?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.067
Ah, shut it.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.100
Oh, come on,

03:38.167 --> 03:39.233
I haven't seen
that look on your face

03:39.300 --> 03:40.867
since Lizzie Reardon
tried to kiss you

03:40.933 --> 03:42.300
in fifth grade.

03:42.367 --> 03:43.933
Really?
I don't recall.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.667
Oh. Oh, you don't.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.100
No.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.100
I hate you.

03:49.167 --> 03:50.767
I hate you more.

03:50.833 --> 03:53.300
Why didn't you tell me

03:53.367 --> 03:55.300
that your boss
was such a hottie?

03:55.367 --> 03:57.067
I don't think of him
like that.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.433
It's kind of hard not
to think of him like that.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.400
I mean, it's not
a subjective thing.

04:00.467 --> 04:01.933
He's hot.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.467
Well, I don't see him
like that, so...

04:04.533 --> 04:06.067
Well, I do.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.167
Gross.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.733
Next Saturday is
the school carnival.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.900
We should arrive
both fashionably late,

04:35.967 --> 04:38.200
and fashionable.

04:38.267 --> 04:39.933
You're always
fashionable.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.467
But...

04:41.533 --> 04:44.767
that is the opening day
of "Warrior Clan Rising."

04:44.833 --> 04:47.400
You have to see it that day?

04:47.467 --> 04:48.900
Well, kinda.

04:48.967 --> 04:52.500
I mean, I don't want to see
all the online spoilers.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.133
But I guess I could see it
another time.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.167
Uh-- Oh!

05:02.233 --> 05:03.500
Hi, Elisa.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.833
You know, I'd better
get home for dinner now.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.233
-See ya.
-Bye.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.200
Bye.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.667
Mirabel!

05:18.733 --> 05:19.800
What?
It's just a kiss.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.533
It's no big deal.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.833
Okay, it's a real big deal.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.067
I really like him.

05:28.067 --> 05:31.367
Look at these selfies
we took.

05:31.433 --> 05:32.767
-Aw...
-Right?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.933
That one's so cute.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.533
With
his arm around you.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.433
What are you doing?

05:41.500 --> 05:42.800
We were looking
at photos,

05:42.867 --> 05:44.667
but we're done now.

05:44.733 --> 05:45.533
I have some
good photos, too.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.433
Look...

05:47.500 --> 05:49.433
Here's one from the night
we had teepee time.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.067
Remember?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.400
We did face painting,
and played "Just Dance".

05:53.467 --> 05:54.567
Hey!

05:54.633 --> 05:57.067
Do you want to play it
after dinner?

05:57.100 --> 05:58.733
I would, Gigi.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.767
but I already worked out,

06:00.833 --> 06:02.167
and I don't want to sweat,

06:02.233 --> 06:04.300
and, you know,
have to wash my hair again.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.533
We can do it tomorrow then.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.433
Okay.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.067
You can't, Mirabel.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.100
You said you'd take me
to the mall.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.567
That sounds fun.

06:11.633 --> 06:15.067
I actually promised Elisa
that I'd take her on her own.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.067
Can't you find
something to do

06:16.133 --> 06:17.067
with a friend
your own age?

06:17.133 --> 06:18.100
Elisa...

06:18.167 --> 06:19.567
You think
you're so grown up

06:19.633 --> 06:21.567
just because you follow Mirabel
around like a puppy,

06:21.633 --> 06:22.633
but you're not.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.100
Well, at least
I'm not the one

06:24.167 --> 06:25.767
who tags along
where I'm not invited!

06:25.833 --> 06:27.633
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...

06:27.700 --> 06:29.600
Whoa, what's going on
here, people?

06:29.667 --> 06:30.767
They're fighting
over me.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.067
Elisa's being mean,

06:32.133 --> 06:33.500
and they won't let me
do things with them.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.233
Just give us
two minutes.

06:37.567 --> 06:38.767
Thank you.

06:44.467 --> 06:48.633
They never want me
around anymore, ever.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.567
You think maybe
that's an exaggeration?

06:50.633 --> 06:51.833
No.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.133
It's an absolutely
accurate assessment.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.433
I'm used to Mirabel

06:57.500 --> 06:58.900
going off
with her friends,

06:58.967 --> 07:01.433
but now Elisa's
leaving me behind, too.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.967
Yeah, it stinks,
I'm sorry.

07:04.067 --> 07:05.700
Elisa's hitting
her tween years, Gigi,

07:05.767 --> 07:08.133
and I think you and I
are both in for it.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.067
It's gonna be awful.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.233
Ah, I think
you may be right.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.333
I don't want
to turn nine.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.467
I want to stay eight.

07:16.533 --> 07:20.800
That would be great.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.533
Sorry I'm late, boss.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.467
I beg you,

07:32.533 --> 07:34.533
don't make any loud noises,

07:34.600 --> 07:37.200
or that squeaking sound
with your chair.

07:37.267 --> 07:38.433
Oh, you mean this?

07:39.633 --> 07:40.400
Ah!

07:41.500 --> 07:43.067
Last night after dinner,

07:43.100 --> 07:45.833
Paige wanted
to check out some bars,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.100
plural.

07:51.467 --> 07:52.467
I'll be fine.

07:52.533 --> 07:53.633
Well, uh,
you know,

07:53.700 --> 07:56.333
once your, uh,
tequila haze clears,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.267
I'd like to discuss
the interview.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.067
Oh, the one
with Anderson Cooper?

08:01.133 --> 08:02.700
Enough.

08:02.767 --> 08:05.100
Okay, sure, let's discuss.

08:05.167 --> 08:06.133
After I take a nap.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.767
No, I need you to focus.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.200
Wait.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.433
Take two of these.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.833
I hope Paige feels
better than I do

08:15.900 --> 08:17.567
for her interview.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.367
I hope she didn't throw up.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.633
No, no, that
would not be good.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.067
But, uh,

08:22.067 --> 08:23.700
she seems like the type
who can handle her booze,

08:23.767 --> 08:25.967
unlike some other people
I know...

08:26.067 --> 08:27.200
Wait, where are you going?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.800
You are useless to me.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.067
Agreed!

08:33.267 --> 08:35.067
Agreed.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.767
Okay, but I'm serious,

08:36.833 --> 08:38.433
you can pull off anything.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.400
That other one
looked amazing on you.

08:40.467 --> 08:41.967
-The yellow one?
-Yes.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.700
-I looked like a banana.
-A very attractive banana...

08:46.900 --> 08:48.067
Hi, Gigi.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.500
Hey, Mirabel.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.667
Hey, Gigi.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.433
Whatever.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.500
I got you
a little something.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.100
Ta-dah!

09:00.167 --> 09:02.400
Thank you for thinking of me.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.567
At least someone cares.

09:14.833 --> 09:15.933
There you go.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.533
Oh!

09:20.600 --> 09:22.100
How did your meetings go?
Did you throw up?

09:22.167 --> 09:24.067
No. Unlike you,
I can handle my liquor.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.167
Ricky said you could.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.200
Oh, he did?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.400
What else did he say?

09:28.467 --> 09:30.133
That was it.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.533
I'm going to ask him out.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.800
Paige...

09:32.867 --> 09:34.200
He's not even your type.

09:34.267 --> 09:37.367
You drink champagne
and go skiing in France.

09:37.433 --> 09:40.233
He drinks beer
and plays mini-golf.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.400
Well, maybe
I'm due for a change.

09:42.467 --> 09:43.933
Or maybe he is.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.433
You don't even live
in the same city.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.867
Well, I'm here now,

09:47.933 --> 09:49.067
and I might soon,

09:49.067 --> 09:50.333
so Carpe Diem.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.133
Well, I don't know...

09:53.200 --> 09:54.400
From what I can tell,

09:54.467 --> 09:56.733
Ricky is smart, cool, funny,

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
has good hair,

09:57.867 --> 09:59.133
and he's straight.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.367
That is a rare package.

10:03.267 --> 10:04.467
Are you sure
you're not into him?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.267
I'm not into him!

10:08.567 --> 10:10.367
Uh... I gotta teach a class,

10:10.433 --> 10:11.967
so I'll, um...

10:12.033 --> 10:14.167
I'll talk to you later.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.933
No need to stand.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.433
It, uh,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.733
just kinda happened.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.167
Sit down.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.967
Um, so I'm looking
for a good restaurant,

10:40.033 --> 10:43.333
and I can't decide between
French bistro or seafood.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.900
Uh... Mac's for fish,

10:45.967 --> 10:48.467
and Le Comptoir is excellent.

10:48.533 --> 10:51.733
But if you really want to try
a local favorite,

10:51.800 --> 10:53.833
there is this food cart on Ninth

10:53.900 --> 10:56.400
that makes
the most killer tacos.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.700
Wow, so many options.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.333
Would you like to go to dinner
tomorrow night

11:00.400 --> 11:01.767
and try one of the above?

11:03.267 --> 11:04.400
W-With you?

11:04.467 --> 11:06.600
Well, you could go
with somebody else,

11:06.667 --> 11:09.267
but that would be
considerably less fun for me.

11:10.967 --> 11:13.400
Sorry, I, uh, have no game.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.400
It's okay,

11:14.467 --> 11:17.200
you have other things.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.300
Yes,

11:21.367 --> 11:24.367
I would love
to have dinner with you.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.500
I'm thinking

11:25.567 --> 11:27.333
more of a Swiss Coffee
for the background,

11:27.400 --> 11:28.867
although I am using
muted tones as well.

11:28.933 --> 11:30.100
That reminds me,

11:30.167 --> 11:31.467
we really have got
to look

11:31.533 --> 11:32.800
at some new options
for the towels later on.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.367
Ooh, we need
a pop of color in here.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.933
There is way
too much gray--

11:38.067 --> 11:40.100
Ooh, sorry,
did I interrupt?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.700
When have you not
interrupted, Alan?

11:41.767 --> 11:43.367
No, it's okay.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.767
I got what I wanted.

11:46.633 --> 11:47.533
Hi, Paige.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.267
Hi, Alan.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.500
She's fun.

11:50.567 --> 11:53.900
Okay, Boss, we really need
to talk about paint.

11:53.967 --> 11:56.067
I don't want to talk
about paint, Alan.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.067
Sure, okay.

12:00.633 --> 12:01.600
Okay.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.067
Okay.

12:17.133 --> 12:18.533
Okay.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.900
I told Liam that we should
coordinate our clothes

12:19.967 --> 12:20.867
for the school carnival,

12:20.933 --> 12:22.600
and he texted back,

12:22.667 --> 12:24.300
"Like matching shirts?"

12:24.367 --> 12:26.233
with this emoji--

12:27.267 --> 12:28.333
I know he's kidding,

12:28.400 --> 12:29.667
because he knows
that there's a difference

12:29.733 --> 12:32.067
between coordinating
your colors

12:32.133 --> 12:33.967
and matching like twins.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.800
Most boys don't get that.

12:35.867 --> 12:36.767
He's pretty awesome.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.833
Yeah.

12:41.933 --> 12:43.133
Hey!

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Your toast
is done now.

12:44.267 --> 12:45.867
No way!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.733
Mirabel, please tell
the middle child

12:47.800 --> 12:49.900
I need to make toast.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.100
Mirabel, please tell
your baby sister

12:51.167 --> 12:52.700
that she can
wait her turn.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.133
Please inform Elisa
that I'm not a baby,

12:54.200 --> 12:56.467
and I've decided
to have yogurt.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.567
Guys, come on.

12:57.633 --> 12:58.867
Good morning.

12:58.933 --> 13:00.900
How are my girls today?

13:00.967 --> 13:02.467
-Not great.
-Whatever.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.833
I'm good, Papi.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.267
O...kay.

13:06.667 --> 13:07.900
Well, I'm, uh,
going out tonight,

13:07.967 --> 13:09.133
but I'll be home in time

13:09.200 --> 13:10.300
to kiss you good night.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.633
That was suspiciously vague.

13:13.700 --> 13:14.933
Do you have a secret?

13:15.067 --> 13:17.067
Yeah, you're usually
really big on details,

13:17.133 --> 13:19.067
like, T.M.I.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.733
Yes. I have a date.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.967
Who is she?
Where'd you meet her?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.167
How does she dress?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.833
No, no, no, no,
we're not doing this again.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.467
Given my epic-failed
efforts with women so far,

13:28.533 --> 13:29.633
I'd like to attempt this

13:29.700 --> 13:32.200
without involving
the entire family.

13:32.267 --> 13:33.467
We understand.

13:33.533 --> 13:35.733
You don't want us
to get excited and invested,

13:35.800 --> 13:37.500
and then disappointed
when you blow it.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.100
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.267
Mirabel, please tell
your sister to move

13:51.333 --> 13:52.233
so I can get a spoon.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.500
Mirabel, tell your baby sister

13:54.567 --> 13:55.800
that she can go
whittle herself a spoon,

13:55.867 --> 13:57.300
because I'm not moving!

13:57.367 --> 13:59.833
Tell your sister
that I at least know

13:59.900 --> 14:01.700
how to whittle a spoon!

14:01.767 --> 14:04.433
"Alternate fitness regimes."?

14:04.500 --> 14:06.967
"Heavy training
for short intervals"?

14:07.067 --> 14:08.867
What are these articles
you emailed me?

14:08.933 --> 14:10.067
Oh, it's for
your interview.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.300
I think we should talk

14:11.367 --> 14:12.433
about how we're always
on the cutting edge

14:12.500 --> 14:13.700
of fitness techniques.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.200
Oh, getting into it now,
are we?

14:16.267 --> 14:18.333
I thought we were making fun
of the local news show.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.067
Always thinking
about the gym, boss,

14:20.133 --> 14:21.333
you know me.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.767
Well, thanks for these,

14:22.833 --> 14:23.700
but I don't even know
what they're going to ask.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.733
Well, I'm just trying to help.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.067
No, I appreciate it,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.733
but like you said,
"60 Minutes" it's not.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.900
I'll be fine winging it.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.100
Oh, I'm going
to, uh...

14:34.167 --> 14:35.567
I'm going to head out
early today.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.500
I'm having dinner with Paige.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.733
Nice.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.700
Paige.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.433
Mm-hmm.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.067
That-- She-she's nice.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.633
She is.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.067
You're having dinner
with Ricky?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.100
told youI

15:01.167 --> 15:01.967
I was going to ask him out.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.067
What's with you?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.333
Look, I love you,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.167
but I know how you are
with guys.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.433
Wow.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.267
I've been encouraging you
to be more direct,

15:09.333 --> 15:10.500
I see it finally took.

15:10.567 --> 15:11.833
And you're right.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.367
If I'm not into a guy,
I cut him loose.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.333
Are you sure there isn't
any other reason

15:15.400 --> 15:16.600
you don't want me
to go out with Ricky?

15:16.667 --> 15:17.933
'Cause if you like him,

15:18.067 --> 15:19.567
I will cancel
right this minute.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.400
No, it-it's...
it's not that.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.500
He's just... been through a lot.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.333
Steph, it's one date.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.300
Let's see how it goes.

15:30.367 --> 15:31.700
Maybe I won't be his type

15:31.767 --> 15:33.067
and I'll need you
to console me.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.233
I suppose I could do that...

15:38.300 --> 15:41.867
As long as it doesn't involve
more than one bar?

15:41.933 --> 15:43.667
Okay.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.200
Bye.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.067
These scallops
are amazing.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.067
You want to try one?

16:01.067 --> 16:02.067
Yeah.

16:05.067 --> 16:07.700
Mm... Mm, wow.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.067
Um, do you want to try
some of my buccatini?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.067
Sure.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.400
Okay.

16:13.467 --> 16:14.900
There you go.

16:14.967 --> 16:17.167
Mm...

16:17.233 --> 16:18.800
Mm-hmm?

16:18.867 --> 16:20.567
What?

16:20.633 --> 16:22.833
No, I, um...

16:22.900 --> 16:25.200
I'm... thinking
about something here.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.100
And what's that?

16:29.067 --> 16:30.967
I was...

16:31.067 --> 16:33.733
thinking if I...

16:33.800 --> 16:36.067
should ask you
if I could kiss you.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.500
Don't ask.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.100
Here, I don't
want them anymore.

17:07.167 --> 17:08.233
What's that?

17:08.300 --> 17:09.967
Games and presents
Elisa gave me.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.967
I'm growing up, too.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.400
Some of these are clearly
too juvenile.

17:15.933 --> 17:17.067
Your beaded necklace?

17:17.067 --> 17:18.767
I made this
for your birthday.

17:18.833 --> 17:19.900
It took forever!

17:19.967 --> 17:21.767
Gigi, you love
that necklace.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.133
Not anymore.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.233
It just reminds me
how Elisa thinks I'm a pest.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.700
Fine.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.500
If you're giving things back,
hand over the sweater.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.933
It's a hand-me-down.
It doesn't fit you anymore.

17:32.067 --> 17:32.967
So?

17:38.267 --> 17:39.300
Fine!

17:45.400 --> 17:49.433
We haven't been hanging out
with her that much.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.733
She just did this
to get our attention.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.633
Well, she's not going
to get any from me.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.133
Oh, look,

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
it's the cute couple
that works out together.

18:06.267 --> 18:07.567
I'm going to throw up.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.867
Well, you know
what they say,

18:08.933 --> 18:11.200
a couple
who sweats together...

18:11.267 --> 18:12.200
gets together.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.500
All right, I'm
gonna grab a towel.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.067
Thanks, honey.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.067
So...

18:19.133 --> 18:20.500
how did you guys meet anyway?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.367
Doctors Without Borders.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.467
We spent one long night
side by side

18:24.533 --> 18:27.667
performing medical procedures
in a yurt in Rwanda.

18:29.267 --> 18:30.700
We talked all night,

18:30.767 --> 18:32.933
saved a lot of lives.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.867
It smelled really bad...

18:36.200 --> 18:37.100
It was more romantic
than it sounds.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.367
Yeah.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.800
Sounds like you two
were made for each other.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.067
I think so.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.100
Look at him,
getting your towel.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.367
Sometimes, I think

18:45.433 --> 18:47.067
I'm never gonna find someone
to get my towel.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.400
Oh, please,

18:48.467 --> 18:49.933
you must have guys
asking you out all the time.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.167
Yeah, but they're not
the right kind of guys.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.100
What about him?

18:56.167 --> 18:57.067
Thor?

18:57.067 --> 18:58.067
That can't be his name.

18:58.133 --> 18:59.500
It's not.

18:59.567 --> 19:00.833
Yet... it should be.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.067
Exactly.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.067
Anyway, Thor is...

19:04.133 --> 19:06.533
you know, he's not my type.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.067
Don't be a snob.

19:08.133 --> 19:09.933
He could be really smart
and interesting

19:10.067 --> 19:11.767
under all of that hotness.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.133
And it would be
fun to find out.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.233
You know, sometimes,
you don't need a man,

19:20.300 --> 19:21.400
you just need...

19:21.467 --> 19:22.400
a snack.

19:26.467 --> 19:28.733
You know, you might be
on to something.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.067
Maybe?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.400
All right, what are we
doing first? Glutes?

19:34.467 --> 19:35.967
I'm ready.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.067
Abs super-set.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.500
What?

19:38.567 --> 19:39.800
I told you yesterday,
that's what we're starting with.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.233
Not abs.
I hate abs.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.467
Oh, my goodness!

20:04.667 --> 20:05.933
-Steph, you okay?
-Are you okay?

20:06.000 --> 20:06.933
I just need
a moment.

20:07.000 --> 20:07.900
What did you hit,
your head?

20:07.967 --> 20:08.800
I think so.

20:08.867 --> 20:09.867
Oh, honey...

20:09.933 --> 20:11.167
My ankle really hurts.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.500
I need a better look
at it, get up on the--

20:12.567 --> 20:13.700
-I've got it.

20:13.767 --> 20:14.500
Oh, no, no, no,
that's not necessary!

20:14.567 --> 20:15.600
I-- Okay.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.200
Snack.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.567
I'm gonna...
get some ice.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.967
This was
really nice, Ricky.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.433
Yes, it, uh...

20:46.500 --> 20:48.000
it was.

20:48.067 --> 20:50.733
Can we, uh,
do it again?

20:50.800 --> 20:51.733
Tomorrow?

20:53.233 --> 20:54.233
Too anxious?

20:54.300 --> 20:55.133
You're getting
that game.

20:58.933 --> 21:00.733
Oh, we-we gotta go.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.367
What happened?

21:02.433 --> 21:03.833
There's been an accident.
It's Stephanie.

21:03.900 --> 21:04.900
What kind
of an accident?

21:04.967 --> 21:06.233
I don't know,
it doesn't say.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.433
Thor, can you pass me
one of those blocks, please?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.700
Thank you.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.333
Is it sprained?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.233
Let's have Bill
take a look at it.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.500
Uh, Thor, why don't you
jump on out?

21:19.567 --> 21:20.900
I'll take over.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.267
Farewell, Thor.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.600
Be strong.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.867
Okay, why don't you
tell me where it hurts?

21:27.933 --> 21:29.233
Uh... no.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.300
Maybe--

21:30.367 --> 21:32.200
Ah! Yeah, a little bit.

21:32.267 --> 21:33.233
Is it broken?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.133
Steph, I have some bad news.

21:38.633 --> 21:39.867
We're going
to have to amputate.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.300
What?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.567
You just can't stop with
the pediatrician humor, can you?

21:44.533 --> 21:45.767
Not really.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.067
-No, I know.
-Okay, look,

21:47.067 --> 21:49.133
you have a slight sprain, okay?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.167
You twisted it.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.833
It's gonna swell up and bruise.

21:52.900 --> 21:53.800
How's your head?

21:53.867 --> 21:54.867
Do you feel
dizzy at all?

21:54.933 --> 21:56.767
No, no, it's fine.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.467
Let me take a look.

21:58.533 --> 22:00.200
Hey, are you okay?

22:00.200 --> 22:00.367
Hey, are you okay?

22:00.467 --> 22:01.467
Hey.

22:01.533 --> 22:02.333
She sprained
her ankle.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.500
Yeah.

22:03.567 --> 22:04.533
Are you kidding me?

22:04.600 --> 22:05.667
You called them?

22:05.733 --> 22:09.633
I did not call them.

22:09.700 --> 22:10.900
I texted,

22:10.967 --> 22:12.400
said there was an accident,

22:12.467 --> 22:13.500
but you were okay.

22:13.567 --> 22:16.067
That's not
what you texted, Bill.

22:16.133 --> 22:16.967
What are you
talking about?

22:17.067 --> 22:18.300
It's right...

22:18.367 --> 22:21.167
Okay, so the whole text
didn't go through.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.400
I'm sorry.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.667
I didn't have
my readers on.

22:23.733 --> 22:24.933
Really, Bill?

22:25.067 --> 22:26.833
You look fantastic,
but you're old.

22:26.900 --> 22:27.867
Wear your readers.

22:27.933 --> 22:29.067
Look, I-I just tripped.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.700
I'm fine.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.533
Wow, you two look
really dressed up.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.633
Thanks, Jackie and Bill.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.067
You're welcome,
sweetie.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.500
Yeah, no-
no problem.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.200
Ricky, Paige, just go back
to whatever you were doing,

22:43.267 --> 22:45.367
wherever it was
being done, okay?

22:45.433 --> 22:47.133
I've got two doctors here, so...

22:47.200 --> 22:48.400
I've got, uh,

22:48.467 --> 22:49.967
some cream in my office,

22:50.067 --> 22:52.933
it's a numbing cream,
for sprains.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.233
I'll get the ibuprofen.

23:03.167 --> 23:05.100
I'm sorry I ruined your night.

23:05.167 --> 23:06.533
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.867
I'm just glad you're okay.

23:08.967 --> 23:10.467
Did you have a good time?

23:11.900 --> 23:13.433
We really did.

23:17.433 --> 23:18.800
Hey, Rick...

23:18.867 --> 23:21.133
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just looking
for that icy cream stuff.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.167
Here it is.

23:22.233 --> 23:23.600
So, uh,

23:23.667 --> 23:25.100
did you like her

23:25.167 --> 23:27.933
as much as you liked
Lizzie Reardon in fifth grade?

23:29.433 --> 23:31.167
I do.

23:31.233 --> 23:32.900
But unlike with Lizzie, uh,

23:32.967 --> 23:34.067
I got to first base.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.933
Oh, yes, you did.

23:36.067 --> 23:37.067
I know, I know,

23:37.133 --> 23:39.500
look at me,
kissing another woman?

23:39.567 --> 23:42.067
So, was this
the first time since...

23:42.100 --> 23:43.633
Since... Isabella?

23:43.700 --> 23:44.667
Yeah.

23:45.700 --> 23:46.500
And?

23:50.233 --> 23:52.233
It's like riding a bike.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.333
It felt good, like it was time.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.100
Oh, yes...

23:56.800 --> 23:58.600
No, we're not going
to fist-bump on this, Bill.

23:58.667 --> 23:59.800
Right, yeah.

23:59.867 --> 24:01.733
You always were
a little cooler than me.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.767
Just a-just a little.

24:02.833 --> 24:03.800
Yeah.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.467
But I was always smarter!

24:09.500 --> 24:11.133
Darn tootin'.

24:14.867 --> 24:16.767
Why is that Polar Pond?

24:16.833 --> 24:18.533
Excuse me,
why is that Polar Pond?

24:18.600 --> 24:19.667
I didn't ask for Polar Pond.

24:19.733 --> 24:21.533
I said Sassafras.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.400
I said, make sure
it's Sassa--

24:23.467 --> 24:24.967
Philipe!

24:25.067 --> 24:27.100
I don't want that there,
I want that there,

24:27.167 --> 24:28.433
and I want this
over there,

24:28.500 --> 24:30.267
and I don't want that
because it's terrible!

24:30.333 --> 24:32.300
Why am I the only one
with any taste

24:32.367 --> 24:33.533
in this entire world?

24:33.600 --> 24:34.733
You see what
I'm dealing with.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.400
You see what I'm
dealing with, right?

24:36.467 --> 24:37.567
Look, and he just keeps going.

24:37.633 --> 24:38.800
He won't stop,
God forbid he'd stop,

24:38.867 --> 24:40.533
but he's just gonna keep going.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.700
Mm-hmm,

24:41.767 --> 24:44.133
Alan's gone
off the deep end.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.667
Ah, let him
have his fun.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.367
-Your ankle okay?
-Yeah.

24:47.433 --> 24:50.700
Hey, I'm sorry
I ruined your night.

24:50.767 --> 24:52.200
You didn't.

24:52.267 --> 24:54.333
I'm just glad you're okay.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.500
Hey, how was
your meeting?

25:01.567 --> 25:03.667
I think a little
celebration's in order,

25:03.733 --> 25:05.433
as in dinner, champagne...

25:05.500 --> 25:06.967
Ooh, it
sounds great!

25:08.067 --> 25:09.733
Oh, you mean, you and Ricky.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.700
Right.

25:10.767 --> 25:11.767
Sorry,

25:11.833 --> 25:12.767
I'm the worst.

25:12.833 --> 25:13.800
No, no, I would
do the same.

25:13.867 --> 25:14.833
My mistake.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.633
My head is kind of slow.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.600
It must be
all of the pain killers.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.633
Yeah, well,
take it easy on those.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.433
Hey, um, I wanted
to ask you a favor.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.967
Ricky says he doesn't like
to keep the girls home alone

25:25.067 --> 25:26.133
past 10:00 or so,

25:26.200 --> 25:28.967
but I have other plans.

25:29.067 --> 25:31.133
Would you mind going over there
for a little bit?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.100
I promise I'll have him
home by midnight.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.700
Wow.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.800
You do think ahead.

25:36.867 --> 25:39.433
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.100
Well, I have no social life, so,
uh...

25:44.167 --> 25:45.833
yeah, sounds great.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.067
Of course.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.333
I love spending time
with the girls.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.133
Thanks.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.300
Hey, Paige,

25:51.367 --> 25:53.867
are you sure Ricky's going
to be comfortable with this?

25:56.133 --> 25:58.067
I'll take my chances.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.067
I want to surprise him.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.900
Okay.

26:00.967 --> 26:02.633
Oh, uh,
well, that's my client,

26:02.700 --> 26:04.667
so, um, I'll see you later.

26:04.733 --> 26:05.733
Bye.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.367
I can't even find it.

26:08.433 --> 26:09.800
This is insane,
I can't even find it.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.067
I can't even--

26:11.100 --> 26:11.900
Thank you.
Put it down.

26:11.967 --> 26:13.067
That's enough.

26:13.067 --> 26:13.900
Thank you.
Put it down now.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.200
You look
ridiculously handsome.

26:35.267 --> 26:38.733
And you look
ridiculously stunning.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.500
That is some dress.

26:40.567 --> 26:42.300
Thank you.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.633
I struggled with
the shirt-jacket combo

26:44.700 --> 26:45.633
for a while.

26:46.733 --> 26:49.267
I got us a table at Mac's.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.767
Oh, um, I had
another venue in mind.

26:55.733 --> 26:57.267
Wow, uh...

26:58.467 --> 27:00.100
It's, uh...

27:00.167 --> 27:03.167
private, quiet,

27:03.233 --> 27:05.467
good atmosphere.

27:05.533 --> 27:06.900
But can we get a reservation?

27:06.967 --> 27:08.333
I think I got it covered.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.367
Yeah?

27:09.433 --> 27:10.367
Would you like a drink?

27:10.433 --> 27:11.700
Yes, please.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.467
Your job.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.067
I can do that.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.267
Can you get plates?

27:23.200 --> 27:25.667
Elisa, look.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.633
She threw away
our game?

27:31.700 --> 27:33.333
Gigi!

27:37.433 --> 27:38.967
You bellowed?

27:39.067 --> 27:39.833
Why'd you
put this in the trash?

27:39.900 --> 27:41.300
This is our game, too.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.067
Dad gave it to all of us.

27:43.133 --> 27:44.633
Well, you never
want to play anymore,

27:44.700 --> 27:46.600
and it's no fun for me
to play alone,

27:46.667 --> 27:49.167
so it might as well
be in the garbage.

27:49.233 --> 27:50.167
Stop it!

27:50.233 --> 27:51.567
Don't throw it out!

27:51.633 --> 27:54.500
Then you can keep it
in your room, on your shelf!

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
Excuse me.

28:02.567 --> 28:03.500
Hey--

28:03.567 --> 28:05.867
What are you doing?

28:13.500 --> 28:14.933
You know,
I'd better, uh...

28:15.067 --> 28:16.233
I'd better
move on to coffee.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.700
I have to, um...

28:17.767 --> 28:19.467
I have to go home soon.

28:19.533 --> 28:23.367
I was hoping you could stay
a little longer.

28:23.433 --> 28:27.700
Oh, I'd... I'd love to,

28:27.767 --> 28:31.233
and I'm so bummed I can't.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.067
You know, the girls
are home alone, so...

28:35.267 --> 28:37.967
Actually, they're not.

28:38.067 --> 28:41.933
I asked Stephanie
to go over there.

28:42.067 --> 28:43.800
What are you talking about?

28:43.867 --> 28:45.133
I hope
you don't mind.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.667
I wanted to spend
a little more time with you,

28:47.733 --> 28:48.800
so...

28:48.867 --> 28:51.067
I asked her
to do me this favor,

28:51.067 --> 28:54.200
since it's my last night.

28:57.067 --> 28:58.400
Well, I-I do mind...

28:59.767 --> 29:00.767
A little.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.167
But then,

29:04.233 --> 29:06.300
I'm also kinda happy,

29:06.367 --> 29:09.233
'cause I get
to be with you some more.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.500
Me too.

29:27.367 --> 29:28.700
What?

29:28.767 --> 29:32.367
You know, I don't mean
to get too high-schooly,

29:32.433 --> 29:35.233
but the other night,

29:35.300 --> 29:39.667
um, when we kissed?

29:42.267 --> 29:45.667
That was my first kiss...

29:45.733 --> 29:48.967
in a...
in a long time.

29:51.367 --> 29:55.100
So... that right there
was number two.

29:56.333 --> 29:58.400
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good here.

29:58.467 --> 30:00.200
I am flattered

30:00.267 --> 30:03.167
to be your first
and second kiss.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.967
I'd like to do it again.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.000
I'll be right back.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.067
Okay.

30:28.467 --> 30:29.500
We did it.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.200
Yes, we did.

30:31.267 --> 30:33.100
I want to have
five kids.

30:33.167 --> 30:35.600
You're gonna have
three kids, Mister,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.300
and like it.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.967
I'm the last girl
you'll ever kiss.

30:46.033 --> 30:48.900
That doesn't
make you nervous?

30:48.967 --> 30:51.667
You're the only girl
I want to kiss.

30:56.467 --> 31:00.300
I'm never gonna kiss
another girl.

31:15.633 --> 31:16.733
Everything okay?

31:16.800 --> 31:17.867
I got here a little while ago.

31:17.933 --> 31:18.967
The girls are fine.

31:19.067 --> 31:20.500
I'm just making popcorn.

31:22.567 --> 31:24.467
Look, I-I didn't know

31:24.533 --> 31:26.933
Paige was gonna ask you
to do this.

31:27.067 --> 31:28.500
Are you sure you're okay?

31:28.567 --> 31:29.633
Totally.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.533
We are having a great time.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.500
Well, I owe you.

31:33.567 --> 31:34.833
I'll see you later.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.367
Okay, bye.

31:48.867 --> 31:51.933
I gotta say, you girls
are really boring tonight.

31:52.067 --> 31:55.400
The Cooper house is usually
the designated fun zone.

32:03.133 --> 32:04.367
So, what's up?

32:04.433 --> 32:05.500
All I asked

32:05.567 --> 32:06.600
was to play "Just
Dance,"

32:06.667 --> 32:07.733
but they had to go
to the mall!

32:07.800 --> 32:08.900
Gigi wants
to tag along everywhere,

32:08.967 --> 32:10.533
and sometimes, I want
to be with Mirabel!

32:10.600 --> 32:12.533
Gigi's super smart,
but she's still a kid.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.633
Elisa thinks
she's so grown up,

32:13.700 --> 32:14.600
but she's not!

32:14.667 --> 32:15.633
So she gave back
all my presents

32:15.700 --> 32:17.300
and threw "Just Dance"
in the trash!

32:17.367 --> 32:18.667
And Elisa's mad
and ignoring her,

32:18.733 --> 32:20.067
which makes her want
attention even more--

32:20.100 --> 32:21.367
Stop.

32:22.833 --> 32:26.400
Did someone say "Just Dance"?

32:28.900 --> 32:31.067
Gigi, you're
really good at this.

32:31.133 --> 32:32.333
Oh!

32:35.933 --> 32:37.200
Oh, switch it!

32:37.267 --> 32:38.900
Oh, I don't know

32:38.967 --> 32:40.333
if this is a good idea
with my ankle.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.267
I'll go next.

32:41.333 --> 32:42.300
Okay.

32:46.567 --> 32:48.100
Oh! Shh...

32:50.067 --> 32:51.400
Oh, we're back
to this now...

32:55.533 --> 32:56.967
Oh...!

32:57.067 --> 32:58.300
Own it.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.567
Oh, snow!

32:59.633 --> 33:00.733
I can't do it--

33:00.800 --> 33:01.700
I'm not--

33:01.767 --> 33:03.233
Whoo!

33:06.733 --> 33:08.067
You girls are lucky.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.400
If I had sisters,

33:09.467 --> 33:11.267
I would play
like this every day.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.133
And I always
wanted a sister,

33:13.200 --> 33:14.767
and you each have two.

33:14.833 --> 33:16.367
How cool is that?

33:16.433 --> 33:20.333
Which means you each have
two BFFs for life.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.133
That's exactly
what it's like.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.600
I know I sometimes bug you
to hang out with me

33:25.667 --> 33:27.233
and do stuff
you don't wanna do anymore.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.633
And I'm sorry

33:28.700 --> 33:30.633
I got mad at you
for growing up.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.267
I'm sorry, too.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.200
I hate hurting
your feelings.

33:36.267 --> 33:38.900
You're the best
little sister in the world.

33:38.967 --> 33:40.300
Correction,

33:40.367 --> 33:43.067
you're both the best two
little sisters in the world.

33:43.133 --> 33:45.433
Yes!

33:49.333 --> 33:51.167
And we'll do stuff
you like to do,

33:51.233 --> 33:53.067
sometimes.

33:53.067 --> 33:56.067
Well, relationships are
all about compromising.

33:56.133 --> 33:59.233
Which is why
I'm not in one.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.333
Hmm.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.700
Pass the popcorn.

34:03.767 --> 34:06.100
I'm gonna text Liam.

34:06.167 --> 34:07.567
But then I'll be
ready to play

34:07.633 --> 34:09.067
whatever you want
to play,

34:09.133 --> 34:10.067
okay?

34:13.600 --> 34:14.933
-Popcorn?
-Yes.

34:15.067 --> 34:15.833
Yes.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.600
I don't want you to go.

34:20.233 --> 34:22.733
I don't want you to go.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.800
I'm just going home.

34:27.867 --> 34:30.700
You're going to Chicago.

34:30.767 --> 34:32.167
I wish their offer
was better.

34:32.233 --> 34:33.633
I would have stayed.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.633
I like it here.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.233
Let's see if they come
back to me.

34:39.300 --> 34:42.100
And then
you can come back to me.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.267
Bye.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.800
I need a cup of that, Boss.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.433
Why didn't you
wake me up last night?

35:53.500 --> 35:56.667
Oh, you were so conked out,
I didn't have the heart.

35:56.733 --> 35:59.100
Wait, wait,
you have, um...

35:59.167 --> 36:00.967
You're sparkly.

36:01.067 --> 36:02.600
Oh.

36:02.667 --> 36:04.833
Hey, um,
thanks again.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.533
It was... it was really nice
to spend time with Paige

36:07.600 --> 36:09.067
without having
to watch the clock.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.067
She's, uh...

36:10.133 --> 36:11.833
she's great.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.967
She is.

36:15.067 --> 36:16.733
How weird is it
to go out with her

36:16.800 --> 36:18.833
but to wake up with me.

36:23.067 --> 36:26.200
Uh... I'm gonna
go home and shower

36:26.267 --> 36:28.933
and get desparkled.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.700
Right.

36:30.767 --> 36:31.667
See you later.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.100
Yeah.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.800
Big day.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.200
Anderson Cooper
should be here any minute.

36:45.267 --> 36:46.633
You ready
for your interview?

36:46.700 --> 36:47.667
Yeah.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.633
Rick, hey...

36:50.700 --> 36:51.900
You okay?

36:53.867 --> 36:55.800
I'm great.

36:55.867 --> 36:58.467
I can't believe it, brother,
but I am.

36:58.533 --> 37:02.233
Okay, I have seen
that look before.

37:02.300 --> 37:06.933
Well, I had, uh, dinner
with Paige last night,

37:07.067 --> 37:09.133
in her hotel room.

37:11.833 --> 37:12.967
Wanna do a little fist-bump?

37:13.067 --> 37:15.600
No, we're waiting
on the fist-bump, Bill.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.933
Ah, right.

37:17.067 --> 37:17.967
But she's, uh...

37:18.067 --> 37:20.633
she's incredibly cool.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.667
I like this one.

37:21.733 --> 37:23.433
Well, good.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.933
Good, I'm happy for you.

37:25.067 --> 37:26.633
Hey...

37:26.700 --> 37:29.733
Isabella would want this
for you.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.900
No, I know.

37:30.967 --> 37:31.900
I do.

37:31.967 --> 37:33.933
It's just, uh...

37:34.067 --> 37:35.733
it's a little weird.

37:35.800 --> 37:36.767
That's fine.

37:36.833 --> 37:37.800
I get it.

37:37.867 --> 37:39.900
Just, you know, take it slow.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.133
Oh, we-we did.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.500
I mean, I didn't even try
for second base.

37:44.567 --> 37:47.333
Okay, now
you're in high school.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.967
You know, it's just...

37:50.067 --> 37:52.533
It's been a while
since I've been up to bat.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.300
Yeah.

37:56.067 --> 37:58.067
Oh...

37:58.100 --> 37:59.333
Would you look at Alan?

37:59.400 --> 38:02.567
Ah, I don't want
to look at Alan.

38:02.633 --> 38:04.900
Well... they're here.

38:04.967 --> 38:06.200
You ready for your close-up?

38:07.633 --> 38:09.633
Let's do it.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.100
...And I have posters,

38:11.167 --> 38:13.800
so we put him in front
of his poster, and then he's--

38:13.867 --> 38:15.167
Peter Campbell!

38:15.233 --> 38:16.333
Peter Campbell, how you doing?

38:16.400 --> 38:17.567
Hi. I'm Alan.

38:17.633 --> 38:18.733
I am-I am Rick's
right-hand man.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.333
I'll be at the helm today.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.733
So, it's so nice to meet you--

38:21.800 --> 38:23.367
I love, love,
love, love your work--

38:23.433 --> 38:24.467
Hey, there he is!

38:24.533 --> 38:25.533
It's Rick--
Rick Cooper.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.067
-Hi.
-Peter Campbell.

38:27.067 --> 38:28.067
Welcome, Peter--

38:28.133 --> 38:29.200
There he is,
there he is,

38:29.267 --> 38:30.333
and this is his brother,
uh, Bill Cooper.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.500
This is Bill Cooper,
he's Ricky's brother,

38:31.567 --> 38:32.700
He's a doctor,

38:32.767 --> 38:34.533
so if Ricky busts your chops,
he can fix 'em.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.633
So, where
should we set up?

38:35.700 --> 38:37.100
Well, I was--

38:37.167 --> 38:38.200
I actually had some ideas
about the lighting and such.

38:38.267 --> 38:39.133
Ricky's very photogenic,

38:39.200 --> 38:41.667
as we all know,
and can see,

38:41.733 --> 38:42.867
but he is 40 now,

38:42.933 --> 38:44.200
so we should
be careful of that--

38:44.267 --> 38:45.500
I'll see you out there.

38:45.567 --> 38:46.533
Yeah, we'll see you
out there, Rick.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.067
Well...

38:48.133 --> 38:49.400
So,
I think we should just

38:49.467 --> 38:50.600
keep that in mind,

38:50.667 --> 38:51.767
but I do have some ideas

38:51.833 --> 38:52.567
if you just want
to keep up with me here.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.233
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.233
So, why did you
want to meet early?

39:03.300 --> 39:05.533
The carnival isn't
till the afternoon.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.067
Because you're going
to the movies instead.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.667
But I thought you wanted to go
to the carnival together.

39:10.733 --> 39:12.100
I know,

39:12.167 --> 39:14.700
but seeing "Warrior Clan Rising"
on the very first day

39:14.767 --> 39:16.200
was something you were
really looking forward to,

39:16.267 --> 39:19.533
and I didn't want you
to give it up for me.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.167
I don't mind.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.433
I like making you happy.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.433
Well then, let me
do the same for you.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.233
By the way,

39:27.300 --> 39:28.933
I'm going to the movie
with you, too,

39:29.067 --> 39:31.267
so I'm going to require
lots of licorice.

39:31.333 --> 39:32.233
Okay.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.300
I'll be back.

39:33.367 --> 39:34.700
I'm going to grab my purse.

39:34.767 --> 39:35.900
Okay.

39:39.067 --> 39:40.633
So...

39:40.700 --> 39:42.700
did you think
about what I suggested?

39:45.267 --> 39:46.700
Jackie...

39:46.767 --> 39:48.567
Just giving you
a little nudge.

39:48.633 --> 39:50.667
Oh, and I hear that Ricky
and your friend

39:50.733 --> 39:52.467
had a nice evening
last night.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.233
It's great that
you introduced them.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.833
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's...

39:56.900 --> 39:59.433
it's great.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.100
Thor, come here.

40:05.267 --> 40:06.400
Excuse me.

40:07.433 --> 40:08.833
You have a steady job,

40:08.900 --> 40:10.833
therefore I assume
a car and a credit card?

40:10.900 --> 40:11.867
Yeah.

40:11.933 --> 40:12.933
Good, then
we're gonna go out.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.733
We're gonna eat some food

40:14.800 --> 40:16.433
and have some
stimulating conversation.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.533
Do you have a problem
with that?

40:17.600 --> 40:18.600
No, I don't.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.100
Good.
Friday works for me.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.400
Well...

40:26.467 --> 40:28.600
Nudge received.

40:31.133 --> 40:32.433
What's going on?

40:32.500 --> 40:33.467
Oh, nothing.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.167
Thank you so much

40:36.233 --> 40:37.400
for coming on the show.

40:37.467 --> 40:38.767
Ah, my pleasure.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.567
What can you
tell our audience

40:40.633 --> 40:43.233
about
"Tricky" Ricky Cooper?

40:43.300 --> 40:45.333
Oh, ho, ho, wow.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.367
Uh, you know, I guess I'm not
as tricky as I used to be.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.767
Well, there's
a lot of people out there

40:52.833 --> 40:54.867
who'd love to see you
in the broadcast booth.

40:54.933 --> 40:57.533
Well, you know, I'm not
counting that out or anything,

40:57.600 --> 40:59.467
but, you know,
I've got my hands full.

40:59.533 --> 41:01.067
I've got three daughters

41:01.133 --> 41:03.433
and, you know, I'm running
this business, so...

41:03.500 --> 41:04.800
Two, I hear.

41:04.867 --> 41:05.667
Didn't you just buy
a car dealership?

41:05.733 --> 41:07.200
Yeah, sure.

41:07.267 --> 41:09.433
sn't every ex-athlete supposedI
to own a car dealership?

41:09.500 --> 41:11.500
I think it's
in the ex-athlete manual.

41:13.067 --> 41:14.067
Well, Ricky,
it's been a pleasure.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.367
We're out of time.

41:15.433 --> 41:16.600
Thank you so much.

41:16.667 --> 41:18.067
I'm Peter Campbell.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.233
Thanks for watching
"Hour by Hour".

41:20.300 --> 41:21.933
Whoo!

41:22.067 --> 41:23.633
Yeah! Ricky!

41:23.700 --> 41:25.100
You were great, Dad.

41:25.167 --> 41:26.300
Most impressive
indeed.

41:26.367 --> 41:27.367
That shirt looked
seriously flattering

41:27.433 --> 41:28.667
on camera.

41:28.733 --> 41:30.867
Thank you all for that
well-deserved praise.

41:30.933 --> 41:32.100
Now I'm gonna
grill up some burgers.

41:32.167 --> 41:33.100
Who wants what?

41:33.167 --> 41:34.233
Cheese!

41:34.300 --> 41:35.133
Bacon
and cheese!

41:35.200 --> 41:36.267
Grilled onions!

41:37.967 --> 41:39.133
Oh, please
don't tell me

41:39.200 --> 41:40.167
you want a veggie one,

41:40.233 --> 41:41.667
because, uh, I don't have any.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.100
Um, actually, I've gotta go.

41:44.167 --> 41:46.100
I'm, um, meeting up with Thor.

41:46.167 --> 41:47.267
Oh, from the gym?

41:47.333 --> 41:48.567
Of course.

41:48.633 --> 41:51.167
I mean, how many Thors
could you possibly know?

41:52.400 --> 41:53.433
Uh, bye, girls!

41:53.500 --> 41:54.767
Bye!

41:55.733 --> 41:57.500
Congrats again.
