ANNOUNCER [over tablet]:
And they're off.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.272
Leonora broke well and goes
to the lead, followed by...

00:11.315 --> 00:13.926
Mmm. I smell...

00:13.970 --> 00:16.059
honeydew?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.321
Where are the bagels
and bacon?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.454
I asked Mrs. Gunnerson
to serve a lighter fare

00:19.497 --> 00:20.716
in prep for the race tomorrow.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.544
Look at this, Sammy Jo.
It's dragon fruit.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.024
Try some.
You'll love it.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.721
You may be competing to be
America's Next Top Model,

00:25.764 --> 00:26.678
but I'm not.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.724
And unless I'm
riding Allegra

00:28.767 --> 00:30.900
in tomorrow's race, I'm not sure
why I have to eat like her.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.729
We need to eat light
so Allegra can feel light

00:33.772 --> 00:34.904
and win the race.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.427
It's all about
being one with the horse.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.646
I'd rather be one
with an omelet.

[Fallon gasps]

00:39.213 --> 00:41.128
How is my soon-to-be champion?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
Oh, Allegra's training great.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.045
Breezed four furlongs
in 48 flat.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.394
Hi, Sam.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.351
Hey.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.396
FALLON:
So, Daniel,

00:48.439 --> 00:49.962
I've noticed that
Patty's horse,

00:50.006 --> 00:51.660
Leonora, likes to
go to the lead.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.183
Allegra should be
using her early speed.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.619
Should I go talk
to the jockey?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.404
He knows what to do.
Trust me.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.319
Well, that's not gonna happen.
It's not that I don't

00:58.362 --> 01:00.277
trust you specifically.
It's that I don't trust anyone.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.713
You know what?

01:01.757 --> 01:03.889
Why don't you and I just
go talk to Allegra herself.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.630
It'll make me feel
better. Come on.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.852
[sighs]
Let's go and get waffles.

Fruit is an appetizer at best,

01:12.855 --> 01:14.074
Daniel's a drug addict.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.424
I saw him shooting up
at the stables.

01:16.467 --> 01:17.468
Shooting up?

01:17.512 --> 01:19.296
Wow. Wow.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.517
Yeah, "wow" is great and all,
but I could use some advice.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.085
He didn't see me,
but I'm freaking out.

01:25.128 --> 01:28.131
Okay, um, you need
to confront him.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.786
Well, I can't do anything now.
You heard Fallon.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.483
If she finds out,
she's gonna fire him,

01:32.527 --> 01:34.094
and then he's gonna
have to go to Venezuela,

01:34.137 --> 01:35.878
and I don't want to lose him;
I just met him.

01:35.921 --> 01:40.012
If this gets out of hand,
you will lose him.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.623
And it'll be much worse.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.713
As soon as the race is over,
I will talk to him.

01:44.756 --> 01:47.585
Dr. Leonard, uh,
I wanted you to meet Dr. Rosen.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.284
He's one of our fellows who
wants to specialize in oncology.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.938
You interrupted
my day for this?

01:52.982 --> 01:55.115
Does he want an autograph
or something?

01:55.158 --> 01:56.159
How do you spell "Rosen"?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.596
Will you just excuse us
for a second?

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
Um, that was a little rude.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.036
Oh, believe me,
that was nothing.

Look, I'm... I'm sorry
for pulling you away,

02:06.909 --> 02:09.303
but, um, this hospital
is being sued.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.174
A patient is accusing
one of our attendings

02:11.218 --> 02:13.263
of improper behavior
during a exam.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.178
Mm. And this affects me how?

02:15.222 --> 02:17.963
It affects everyone because
we're implementing a rule

02:18.007 --> 02:20.052
mandating that all doctors
must have a third party present

02:20.096 --> 02:21.489
while seeing a patient.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.317
Yeah, if I wanted to be
followed around

02:23.360 --> 02:25.797
by a sycophantic teenager,
I'd work at a teaching hospital

02:25.841 --> 02:27.234
or, uh, Disney World.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.584
So no thanks.Um, sorry.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.063
Refusing is not an option.

I was discussing a matter
with Dr. Leonard

02:44.555 --> 02:45.730
before he walked off.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.905
Ooh. What kind of matter?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.516
A not-your-business matter.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.908
You could tell me but you'd
have to kill me kind of thing?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.780
Oh, if that were true,
I'd tell you right now.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.477
Adorable.
Mm.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.176
So, are you going
to Fallon's big race tomorrow?

02:56.219 --> 02:57.220
No, I have to miss it.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.743
You'll have to survive
without me.

02:58.787 --> 02:59.788
Oh, I'm not going.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.355
I don't believe in horse racing.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.878
Or Fallon.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.445
I was just hoping
not to have to see you here.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.316
Well, bad luck for you, then.Yeah.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.538
Well, that's a giant weight
off my shoulders.

03:10.581 --> 03:13.410
Getting a clean bill of health
is all I could hope for.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.544
Okay, sounds like you had
the neurotox scan, not me.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.373
But I appreciate
your support, as always.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.593
Speaking of support,
I have a favor to ask.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.334
Mm?I'm ready to launch

03:24.378 --> 03:26.293
Dom-Mystique's
new accessories line.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.251
That's great news.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.340
It'll be greater
if you wear some of the pieces

03:30.384 --> 03:32.255
at the racetrack tomorrow.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.301
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm even going,

03:34.344 --> 03:36.303
and, uh, I kind of have
my own style.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.741
This accessory line
was your idea.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.046
What happened to supporting me?

03:41.090 --> 03:42.874
Can't you ask someone else?

03:42.918 --> 03:45.834
No. This will be your first
public outing in a long time.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.315
Reporters and social media
will love it.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.968
Yeah, okay, okay. For you, fine.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.709
But I'm not wearing
anything bedazzled.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.797
I like bedazzle.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.147
Is that Jeff Colby?Luna?

03:55.191 --> 03:56.584

Mom, Luna.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.591
Luna this is my
mom, Dominique.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.419
Luna and I were patients
here at the same time.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.724
It's nice to meet you.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.902

wheel is one too many.

04:11.816 --> 04:12.904
Are you, uh...

04:12.948 --> 04:14.645
Yep. Finally checking out

04:14.689 --> 04:17.082
after a six-month stint
in neurotox detox.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.084

I'm happy for you.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.565
Any big plans?What, besides doing cartwheels
in the grass?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.654
[chuckles]Not a one.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.482
[sighs] Damn. I, uh...

04:25.526 --> 04:27.702
I wish I could catch up more,
but I actually have to run.

04:27.745 --> 04:28.790
But we should...

04:28.833 --> 04:30.792
Make plans for tonight.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.315
You know I don't like goodbyes.

04:33.403 --> 04:36.101
Do you have some board games
and a hazy IPA?

04:36.145 --> 04:40.280
I have a fireplace
and bottles of Sancerre?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.324
That'll work.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.543
I'll see you tonight.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.109
See you tonight.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.027
There's that vision in red
I've been waiting to see.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.032
What do you say
to a romantic lunch for two?

04:54.076 --> 04:56.861
I say I love spontaneity,

04:56.905 --> 04:59.299
but I have a meeting
with my social media director.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.996
We actually did have a plan.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.084
Yeah, Friday.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.173
It is Friday.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.653
[groans]:
Oh.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.698
I must have double-booked.

05:07.742 --> 05:11.093
With Alexam's launch next week,
I'm swamped.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.616
It's fine. I get it.
You're busy.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.663
And there is a packaging issue
I'm trying to resolve.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.578
Packaging issue?

05:17.621 --> 05:19.275
We ordered ten cases
of two-ounce jars,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.669
but received ten cases
of five-ounce jars instead.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.148
So have them send you
the right size.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.717
Oh, it's complicated,
and it's Adam's purview.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
But he's been MIA.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.026
Probably secretly dating
some Buckhead socialite.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.636
Good for him.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.117
I'm being blown off
by my socialite girlfriend.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.424
Did you use the "G" word?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.643
Oh, sorry.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.471
Should it be "woman friend"?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.299
"Lady friend"?[laughs]

05:43.343 --> 05:47.390
We can discuss all of
the options at dinner tonight.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.741
"Dinner with boyfriend."

05:50.785 --> 05:52.917
Wow.

05:53.962 --> 05:57.357
"Producer's Guide
to Filmmaking."

05:57.400 --> 05:59.924
Does your boss know you're
looking for other jobs?

05:59.968 --> 06:01.926
He does because...

06:03.667 --> 06:05.147
...him I am.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.975

Okay. I'm talking like Yoda.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.065
Sorry about that. [laughs]
Checking in?

06:10.108 --> 06:12.546
Yes. Sasha Harris.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
Okay.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.810
Would you look at that.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.856
The boss has upgraded you
to a suite.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.641
Five-star service.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.730
I'll be sure to leave
a glowing review.

06:22.773 --> 06:26.298
Wait a minute.
You drive a vintage Porsche?

06:26.342 --> 06:29.432
I do. A 1964 911.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.130
Six-cylinder flat engine.
Top speed...

06:32.174 --> 06:35.917
Of 130,
though I've only hit 110.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.136
What a beauty.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.224
Indeed.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.443
KIRBY:Sasha!

06:40.487 --> 06:42.053
Hey! [laughs]

06:42.097 --> 06:43.272
You two know each other?

06:43.315 --> 06:44.708
Yeah, we have the same agent.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.580
She got us a test
for a big makeup campaign.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.452
Uh, let me just settle in to my
suite, and then we can hang out.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.584
Cool.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.369
Hey.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.067
[chuckles]
This is perfect.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.765
Now you can hook us up.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.289
[laughs] I could, but I won't.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.682
Why not?

07:01.725 --> 07:04.032
I'm supposed to be
looking for Ms. Culhane.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.512
What if she's the one?

07:05.555 --> 07:06.817
First of all,
Sasha's not the one

07:06.861 --> 07:08.384
because she'd never
change her name.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.299
And second of all,
which is also last of all,

07:10.342 --> 07:12.127
I don't mix business
and pleasure.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.824
Well, that's perfect.
You can stick to business,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.304
and I'll stick to the pleasure.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.611
Setting up my closest friend
with a colleague

07:17.654 --> 07:19.003
is a recipe for disaster,

07:19.047 --> 07:20.396
because when you two
break it off,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.833
it's only uncomfortable
for me, not you.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.269
I haven't even
gone out with her yet.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.488
How are we already breaking up?

07:25.532 --> 07:26.663
Well, look at it this way.

07:26.707 --> 07:27.969
You don't have to
break up with her

07:28.012 --> 07:29.187
because I don't want you
to date her.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.362
You're welcome.

07:32.495 --> 07:36.281
So Linda wasn't responsible
for the Morell site spill?

07:37.369 --> 07:40.068
The-the woman you-you fired,
rehired and refired?

07:40.111 --> 07:41.112
No, she was.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.679
Jeff found out that she was

07:42.723 --> 07:44.855
taking her orders
from Kelly, my VP,

07:44.899 --> 07:46.640
but apparently
Kelly only did it because

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
she was being blackmailed
by Patty De Vilbis.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.078
And Jeff told you that?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.688
No, Kelly just did. Keep up.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.995
So now what?
Are you gonna fire Kelly?

07:54.038 --> 07:55.300
I don't know.
She seemed so pathetic

07:55.344 --> 07:56.737
and apologetic over the phone.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.086
But I can't think
about Kelly right now

07:58.129 --> 07:59.653
because Patty is coming.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.655
No, Fallon.
You need to stay away from her.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.700
She's toxic.

08:03.744 --> 08:04.919
Oh, no pun intended, I'm sure.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.224
Oh.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.399
Cute hat.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.966
Thank you.
I got it, uh...

08:09.010 --> 08:10.664
You can go, sweetie.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
And so can that hat.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.150
What do you want?

08:19.194 --> 08:22.110
I heard about
your little toxic spill mishap.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.068
I'm impressed you're still
willing to show your face

08:24.112 --> 08:25.243
at the track tomorrow.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.767
Oh, I'll be there.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.638
And now I know it was you
who sabotaged Morell.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.118
This is when my legal team
would tell me

08:30.161 --> 08:31.511
to neither confirm
nor deny that.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.643
I know a lying liar
when I see one,

08:33.687 --> 08:36.777
especially one who wears white
before Memorial Day.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.083
So tell me why you're here
and then disappear.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.432
Gladly.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.086
I thought we could
make tomorrow's race

08:42.130 --> 08:43.784
a little more exciting
for both of us.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.612
Well, the race
isn't about us.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.004
It's about the horses.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.963
And I'm sure I will have
plenty of excitement

08:49.006 --> 08:49.964
in the winner's circle.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
I get it if you're nerv.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
I just thought
whoever's horse wins

08:53.750 --> 08:55.622
could get a cool one mil
from the other.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.188
Oh, Patty.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.364
I know that you need money
now that your daddy cut you off,

08:59.408 --> 09:01.279
but I just don't feel
comfortable cleaning you out.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.585
I'm not worried.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.153
Espesh if Allegra is
as big a loser as her owner.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.633
Hashtag second place,

09:06.676 --> 09:10.071
2006 Buckhead Equestrian Finals,
14 and under.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.639
You know what?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.945
I will take your streak
and your money

09:14.989 --> 09:16.947
just like
I took back Morell Green.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.035
Does this mean
we have a bet?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.080
We sure do.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.342
But make it
two million.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.909
Why not raise the stakes
even more?

09:21.952 --> 09:23.432
Loser also has to walk away

09:23.475 --> 09:25.477
from Heroic Hooves Foundation
forevs.

09:25.521 --> 09:29.003
Deal. And then I'll never
have to see you again.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.920
See you tomorrow.See you tomorrow.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.009
♪

09:43.583 --> 09:45.933
Sorry, we're late. I wanted
to check on the clinic,

09:45.976 --> 09:47.412
and we lost track of time.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.110
It's not a problem.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.765
Right, we had lunch plans.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.767
Um, right.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.290
Just give me a moment.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.248
I'm just gonna figure
out my schedule.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.077
Hmm, I love the way
the Brits say that.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.645
Clearly you forgot that
we were on your "schedule."

10:02.689 --> 10:04.516
Well, it's not really my fault.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.215
Dr. Leonard has been
a royal pain in my...

10:07.258 --> 10:08.738
"Arse"?[chuckles]

10:08.782 --> 10:09.783
[laughs] Sorry.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.567
What's going on?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.134
Well, he's just shown
a complete lack of respect

10:13.177 --> 10:14.788
for me as hospital counsel,

10:14.831 --> 10:16.616
and he's refusing to go along
with a new mandate.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.879
Well, we can take care
of this guy in one phone call.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.358
Just take a breath
before you call,

10:20.402 --> 10:22.578
like, a hit man or something.
[chuckles]

10:22.622 --> 10:24.536
I was gonna call one
of the board members,

10:24.580 --> 10:25.973
but maybe your
idea is better.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.758
No, I'd prefer if he wasn't
maimed or killed.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.543
Why not sit him down and
appeal to his compassionate side

10:31.587 --> 10:32.980
as a health care provider?

10:33.023 --> 10:35.112
It's good for the hospital,
good for him.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.637
Yep, I tried that,
and he mocked me

10:37.680 --> 10:39.639
and walked away
before I could finish.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.293
Well, then, maybe
let Blake do what he can.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.555
You say the word,

10:43.599 --> 10:44.774
I'll have this guy
on a one-way bus

10:44.818 --> 10:45.906
to Poughkeepsie
before the weekend's over.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.690
Thank you, but, um...

10:47.734 --> 10:49.823
I think I'm gonna
handle this myself.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.476
Diplomatically.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.827
Uh, Ms. Carrington,
I have some concerning news.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.480
Allegra hasn't eaten
since this morning.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.395
Well, then get her
some better tasting oats.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.136
It's not that simple.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.617
We're not sure what's causing
it, but I'm worried that

11:01.661 --> 11:03.488
it'll affect her race
if she's not eating by tomorrow.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.012
She's clearly not herself.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.883
Unless you would like
to look for a new job,

11:06.927 --> 11:08.232
you need to
get her back

11:08.276 --> 11:09.799
to being herself.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.280
This morning,
you told me that she was ready,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.455
and I trusted you.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.196
I cannot lose
this race to Patty.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.719
Okay? Especially not after

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
I've made
some very substantial wagers.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.418
The vet is on his way.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.768
We'll run some tests,
and I'll report back.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.772
He's doing
the best he can, okay?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.469
And you bet two million dollars.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.166
That's not exactly
substantial to you.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.951
It's not about the money.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.736
Whoever loses has to leave
the Heroic Hooves Foundation.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.085
So you find a new charity.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.174
What? I won't be
a charity hopper, Sam.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.002
Besides, HHF is

11:39.046 --> 11:42.223
where I started to evolve into
a... a better version of myself.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.529
If I turn my back on them now,
how will that look?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.357
So what are you gonna do?Well, it's obvious.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.359
If Allegra is not
gonna be able to race,

11:48.403 --> 11:50.535
I have to make sure
that Leonora can't race either.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.625
Please tell me the "obvious"
thing is not kidnapping a horse.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.976
No. I'm not insane.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717
I just have to make sure

11:57.760 --> 12:00.110
that Lenora gets disqualified
before the race tomorrow.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.939
I'll slip her a diuretic.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.767
So she has to pee
during the race?

12:04.811 --> 12:08.466
Diuretics are on the banned
substances list on race days.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.600
Fallon, this is
the better version of yourself?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.602
Killing a horse? Absolutely not!

12:13.645 --> 12:15.517
I'm not killing anything, Sam.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.475
She'll just fail
her prerace drug test

12:17.519 --> 12:18.738
and won't be able to race.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.913
She'll get the day off.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.175
Honestly,
she'll probably thank me.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.176
So are you in?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.439
Uh... no.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.140
Why am I the only one who knows
how to get anything done?

12:30.184 --> 12:31.489
ALEXIS:
Alexis Colby

12:31.533 --> 12:32.969
of Alexam Corp.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.884
I'm looking for
my social media director.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.887
She has that weird millennial
energy that looks like laziness

12:37.931 --> 12:40.150
and a name that kind of
sounds like a flower.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.631
This skin care product
is a game changer, Doctor.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.720
Your drugs are
a youth serum.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.811
And my concierge services are
also available for house calls.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.204
What the hell are you doing?

12:50.247 --> 12:52.859
Um, I'm accepting Nancy's Venmo.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.600
Though I also take
Zelle or PayPal.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.821
How dare you go off and start
a concierge doctor business?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.649
Well, that's a wrap,
ladies.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.825
This is what
you've been doing

13:02.869 --> 13:04.566
instead of dealing with
your Alexam commitments,

13:04.609 --> 13:06.220
including that
packaging disaster?

13:06.263 --> 13:10.006
Yes. And business is booming,
thanks for asking.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.227
I can't believe you would cheat
on our company for a few bucks.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.706
Oh, this is not about the money.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.491
This is about stopping you
from walking all over me.

13:16.534 --> 13:20.103
Remember, this new formula
is based on my antiaging drug.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.889
Correction: wasyour drug.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.325
Now it's mine,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.457
and I will not let you use it
without authorization.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.807
Try and stop me.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.244
Don't worry. I will.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.422
How's the wine?Oh, divine.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.771
[chuckles]

13:35.815 --> 13:37.164
Oh, a present?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.383
From a special someone?

13:39.427 --> 13:41.124
Not really.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.953
My mother's starting a new
accessories line, and I told her

13:43.997 --> 13:46.651
I would wear something
tomorrow at the racetrack.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.567
Jeff Colby is a gambler.

13:49.611 --> 13:50.873
Who knew?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.875
Do you know when to hold 'em?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.572
Uh, yeah, cute. No...

13:54.616 --> 13:55.965
Well, do you at least know
when to fold 'em?

13:56.009 --> 13:57.227
Actually, I prefer to walk away.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.012
I like being
in control.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.405
[R&B music playing quietly]

14:01.449 --> 14:04.104
These designs are sick.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.107
And I mean that
in the non-neurotoxicity way.

14:07.150 --> 14:11.502
Yeah. They may be, but, uh,
I'm-I'm thinking I may just pass

14:11.546 --> 14:12.852
on the whole
thing anyway.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.202
I'm not comfortable with that.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.465
Oh, because
you don't like a tie?

14:17.508 --> 14:18.596
I'm not buying it.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.729
What's the real
problem, Colby?

14:22.687 --> 14:28.476
Okay, uh, I'm just not ready
to be accosted by reporters,

14:28.519 --> 14:31.479
answering questions
about how I feel

14:31.522 --> 14:34.395
and-and what my
next plans are.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.180
I don't have any plans.

14:38.486 --> 14:42.751
I want to get my life in order
before I face the masses.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.972
You need to loosen up.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
[chuckles, whoops]

14:47.974 --> 14:50.541
Oh, oh, oh. Oh.[laughs]

14:50.585 --> 14:52.108
Uh, okay, it looks like

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
you're having a little too
much fun with the wine, yeah?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.677
Oh, you know
what would be more fun?
Mm?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.418
Is if you took me
to the races with you.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.247
I bet you I can keep the press
from asking you any questions.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.813
[sighs]

15:01.857 --> 15:04.773
But I'll need some of
Mama Colby's accessories.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.776
Yeah, that [chuckles]
shouldn't be a problem at all.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.693
If I win, you have to buy me
that barbecue brisket sandwich

15:11.736 --> 15:14.522
from Fat Larry's
I have been craving for months.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.263
And if I win?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.917
Trust me.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.570
You're not gonna win.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.702
Mm.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.921
Yeah, okay.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.052
We've had enough.[chuckles]

15:23.096 --> 15:24.880
FALLON [whispers]:
Hi.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.361
It's time
to take your vitamins.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.753
Don't worry.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.799
You won't even notice the taste.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.584
What do you think you're doing?

15:33.628 --> 15:35.543
Oh. Uh...

15:35.586 --> 15:37.327
[chuckles]

15:37.371 --> 15:39.199
I'm just donating
my valuable time

15:39.242 --> 15:42.245
to ensure that every horse
has enough carrots.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.594
Leonora shouldn't suffer

15:43.638 --> 15:44.900
just because
you can't afford food.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.988
She looks like
she's lost weight.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.729
That's because that's not her.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.470
I switched her out
with the lead pony

15:49.513 --> 15:51.559
because I was worried that
someone would try something.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.865
Really, Fal? Sinking to sabo?

15:55.215 --> 15:56.216
"Tage."

15:56.259 --> 15:58.870
I don't need to "sabo" anything.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.395
Allegra is the better horse.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.787
Then let's raise the bet.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.355
When Leonora wins, I want
Femperial Publishing.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.662
That way, I can
write a tell-all

16:07.705 --> 16:10.708
and tell all about poor little
rich girl Fallon Carrington.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.320
You can't even finish a word,
let alone a sentence.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.669
[chuckles]:
Don't worry.

16:14.712 --> 16:15.975
I have plenty of other ways
to humiliate you.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.152
I'm just not gonna tell you
what they are, obvi.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.849
Obvi.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.852
Well, while you may live
in your little fantasy world,

16:23.895 --> 16:26.246
we both know how this ends:
with Allegra winning.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.769
And when she does,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.640
I want the one thing
that started this war.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.121
I'm not sure what we can do
about Jeff taking my virginity.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.557
Ew, ew, no.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.603
I want the 14 and under
equestrian trophy

16:35.646 --> 16:37.561
that you clearly won
by cheating.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.216
A publishing house
for a dollar store knickknack?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.739
Deal.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.611
You know, I really am
a decent person,

16:43.654 --> 16:46.657
and all I wanted was a nice
little race between our horses.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.616
But since you dragged me
into this fight,

16:48.659 --> 16:50.270
prepare to get your ass kicked.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.755
[R&B music playing,
quiet chatter]

16:57.799 --> 16:59.670
Front desk clerk,

16:59.714 --> 17:02.064
film producer,
man behind the bar.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.196
What don't you do?

17:03.239 --> 17:04.675
Well, I was going for the whole

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
modern-day Renaissance man
kind of vibe.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.635
Well, you're killing it.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.289
[chuckles]

17:09.332 --> 17:11.508
Um, as long as you're back
there, is there any OJ?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.293
I'm trying to stave off a cold.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.252
Well, I'm actually a health
and fitness expert as well,

17:16.296 --> 17:17.862
and orange juice is a myth.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.168
But you're in luck.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.170
I have a preventative cure-all:

17:21.214 --> 17:24.391
apple cider vinegar
and a spoonful of cod liver oil.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.958
Now I really think
I'm gonna be sick. [laughs]

17:27.002 --> 17:28.047
Don't you trust me?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.658
Something tells me I do.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.965
But why don't we continue
our conversation

17:34.009 --> 17:37.012
about cars and cold remedies
over dinner?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.709
I would really like to,

17:38.753 --> 17:40.363
but I'm gonna be tied up
a little longer.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.148
Let's meet up
when you're untied.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.281
You know, tonight's
just not a good night.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.417
Okay, uh,
just to be clear,

17:50.460 --> 17:54.116
I'm a model, and I don't
ask a lot of men out.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.597
And when I do, they say yes.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.817
I really want to, but...

17:59.861 --> 18:01.819
I'm trying to be respectful
of Kirby's wishes.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.517
Which are what, exactly?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.910
She doesn't want to
make a situation messy

18:05.954 --> 18:08.652
by mixing business
with pleasure.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.915
[chuckles]
That doesn't even make sense.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.222
Especially considering
she's dating Charlie.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.530
Charli... XCX?

18:16.573 --> 18:18.488
Charlie, our agent.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.143
What? Oh, I get it.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
It's okay for her
to mix business and pleasure,

18:23.189 --> 18:24.190
just not me.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.321
Mm.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.456
I was thinking we can go
to this new high-end diner.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.066
Costs like 35 bucks
for a milkshake,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.415
but it's supposed
to be worth it.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
You know, what
I can't shake is

18:33.938 --> 18:36.158
Adam's complete
and utter betrayal.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.378
Can we please not talk
about Adam tonight?

18:38.421 --> 18:41.381
[sighs] Um, you're right.
I'm sorry.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.558
But starting a concierge
business behind my back?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.560
You're still talking about him.[elevator bell dings]

18:46.603 --> 18:48.344
ADAM:
Mother? You're suing me? No.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.173
Y-You can't sue your partner.
Or your son.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.566
I'm suing both.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.090
You're using proprietary
formulas I own.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.787
I can't believe
you would be so selfish

18:56.831 --> 18:58.746
to do this right before
our launch.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.139
I'm being selfish?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.618
You're the one
moonlighting in hotels

19:01.662 --> 19:03.272
and private homes
throughout Tuxedo Park!

19:03.316 --> 19:05.318
DEX:
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
take it down a notch, okay?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.189
Seriously, if you can't
deal with each other

19:07.233 --> 19:08.886
as mother and son,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.845
how in the hell will you be able
to run a business together?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.063
I'm not sure we can.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.587
[sighs]

19:13.630 --> 19:15.066
I've actually got a great
therapist who can help you

19:15.110 --> 19:16.546
figure this out.[laughs]

19:16.590 --> 19:18.331
I don't need a
therapist to tell me

19:18.374 --> 19:19.549
that I did
nothing wrong.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.334
Okay, I was serious.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.944
And that's not the best
attitude to make things better.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.380
Plus, your relationship
with Adam

19:24.424 --> 19:26.208
is starting
to cause issues in ours.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.470
All right, listen up, "Dux."

19:27.514 --> 19:29.472
This whole Dr. Phil thing is-is

19:29.516 --> 19:31.082
not gonna get you more money
from my mother.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.823
It's Dex.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.217
And I just made eight figures
last year, so I'm good.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.001
I like your mom,

19:37.045 --> 19:39.656
but I don't like being blown off
because of her childish son.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.223
Dex, what about dinner?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
I lost my appetite.

19:45.880 --> 19:46.924
I'm not gonna see a shrink.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.752
I don't want to either.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.407
But we do need help,
and I don't want to lose Dex.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.148
So if fixing this
with you

19:53.192 --> 19:55.672
will help me with him,
then that's what I want to do.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.413
And...

19:57.457 --> 20:00.460
if you agree to go,
I will drop the lawsuit.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.724
Can I get that in writing?You're just gonna
have to trust me.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.770
You will learn
all about that in therapy.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.731
[birds chirping]

20:10.774 --> 20:12.254
FALLON:Okay.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.604
After a sleepless night,
I have a new plan.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.040
Better not
involve removing

20:16.084 --> 20:17.694
any more breakfast meats
from the table.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.870
Since sabotage
didn't exactly pan out...

20:19.914 --> 20:21.307
Surprising exactly no one.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.265
...I have a new and better idea,

20:23.309 --> 20:25.789
inspired by
Patty's little stall switcheroo.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.877
If Allegra

20:26.921 --> 20:28.531
is not in top shape,

20:28.575 --> 20:30.098
I'll just secretly
switch horses.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.969
[laughs]

20:32.013 --> 20:33.536
Well, I mean,
you're kidding, right?

20:34.798 --> 20:36.104
This is a terrible idea, Fallon.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.584
It's not ideal. I know that.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.586
But it's not like
I had weeks to plan.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.370
I wrote this down in a haze
at 2:00 a.m.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.067
And all I need is Daniel's help

20:43.111 --> 20:44.895
and maybe a little shoe polish
to pull it off.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.810
He's not gonna help you.
He could lose his license.

20:46.854 --> 20:47.898
Besides,

20:47.942 --> 20:49.639
Allegra could be fine now.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.685
Maybe you should call before
you start painting horses.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.165
I did, but he didn't
get back to me.[phone vibrates, dings]

20:54.209 --> 20:55.254
What?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.951
What's wrong?

20:56.994 --> 20:58.474
Well, it's
the assistant trainer.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.259
The hot one or the married one?No, no, no.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.043
Daniel is missing
and apparently Allegra is, too.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.871
Has your father lost his mind?

21:03.914 --> 21:05.873
Okay, uh...

21:05.916 --> 21:07.396
I have to tell you something,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.224
and I should've probably

21:09.268 --> 21:10.921
told you sooner,
so don't freak out.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.009
Tell me.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.099
[grunts]

21:15.143 --> 21:17.058
You're like
a walking horror movie.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.147
You need to back off
of Dr. Leonard.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.670
What? Why?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.498
He's a top doctor
who brings in tons of revenue,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.805
so just let him do
whatever he wants.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.067
If he wants to operate

21:26.110 --> 21:28.069
by himself in a closet,
so be it.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.505
You have nothing
to do with this.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.420
I make the decisions here

21:31.464 --> 21:33.727
that are best for the hospital
because I'm the chief of staff.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.338
For now.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.560
Where have you been?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.213
Mm, I was just about
to call you.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.214
Oh, right.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.433
You know, I can't tell

21:44.477 --> 21:47.044
if you're lying
or if you're high or both.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.133
Wait, what are you
talking about?

21:49.177 --> 21:50.744
I know about your drug habit.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.181
Sam told me he saw you
shooting up in the stables

21:53.224 --> 21:54.748
in front of Allegra, okay?

21:54.791 --> 21:57.011
No wonder she's not eating.
Emotional trauma.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.142
I want you gone.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.014
This has nothing to do
with Allegra.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
You have to trust me.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.452
You keep saying that, but you're
not giving me any reason to,

22:03.496 --> 22:05.759
and now I have to go
paint a horse

22:05.802 --> 22:07.064
because of
your drug addiction.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.370
And don't give me
any excuses, okay?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.893
Because I'm really not
in the mood.

22:11.591 --> 22:12.679
I have cancer.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.507
What?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.726
I have cancer, and Sam must
have seen me injecting myself

22:16.770 --> 22:18.337
with immune boosters
after my treatment.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.991
Is that true? Does Sam know?

22:21.035 --> 22:23.080
It's true,
and-and Sam doesn't know.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.039
And please
don't tell him.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.736
Oh, the good news is
Allegra's fine.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.390
I took her for a walk
and realized

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
her shoes weren't fitting right.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.393
She wasn't comfortable
so she wasn't eating.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.916
But now that we have
the right shoes on,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.265
she's back to her old self.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.266
She can win.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.703
New shoes?

22:36.746 --> 22:38.444
That's a solution
Carrie Bradshaw could have

22:38.487 --> 22:40.315
come up with in five seconds.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.012
Do you see why it's a little
difficult for me to trust you?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.797
I do, but I'm your best shot.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.407
I know this horse.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.148
I love this horse.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.368
Don't sabotage Leonora
or s-start painting other ones,

22:49.411 --> 22:50.847
whatever that means.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.502
We can win the right way,
but it's your call.

22:53.546 --> 22:54.721
You're the owner.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.425
Hey.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.166
Is Blake around?

23:05.209 --> 23:07.560
No, he went to check on
construction for the airport.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.389
Oh, his airport.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.869
You know, sometimes I forget
what kind of family I'm in.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.001
I know.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.437
It can be crazy.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.047
But I can let him know
you stopped by.

23:17.091 --> 23:20.660
Actually, um, I was kind of
hoping to talk just to you.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.793
This Dr. Leonard problem,

23:23.837 --> 23:25.447
it just-- it isn't going away,

23:25.491 --> 23:28.407
and now Adam is
getting involved, and...

23:28.450 --> 23:30.017
I'm just not sure what to do.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.235
I think you are sure.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.064
You're avoiding
the obvious solution.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.849
Well, I don't want
to destroy a man's career

23:35.892 --> 23:37.241
because he won't follow a rule.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.721
But you're willing
to destroy yours?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.377
Because if he gets sued,
you'll also take the fall.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.944
But if I accept Blake's help,

23:43.987 --> 23:46.599
I'm just not sure I'm gonna
be able to sleep at night.

23:46.642 --> 23:51.081
The first time I ever did
some Carrington-like things,

23:51.125 --> 23:54.302
I had to take a sleeping pill
at night for a few weeks.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.611
But then,
one day, I realized,

23:58.654 --> 24:01.657
"Hey, you're not doing
anything wrong."

24:02.963 --> 24:06.401
When people come after us,
we need to fight back.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.795
So now I enjoy a glass

24:08.838 --> 24:12.494
of chilled champagne at bedtime
and sleep like a baby.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.888
And so will you. Trust me.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.326
Well, I have worked too hard
to let this bastard ruin it all.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.721
No one is going to hand you
power or respect, Amanda.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.767
You need to take it
and live with the consequences.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.040
Tell Blake I'm ready.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.303
Now, don't print that.[laughs]

24:39.347 --> 24:40.870
REPORTER:
Fallon? Fallon?

24:40.914 --> 24:42.219
Do you think you
have a chance today?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.525
How is Allegra feeling?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.396
Oh, Allegra is feeling great,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.138
and she'll be feeling
even better after she wins.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.314
I might even buy her
some new silks as a gift.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.360
Can we get a couple of
shots with the Oil Royals?

24:53.317 --> 24:56.233
Well, I'm sure Allegra is
feeling great, but there's just

24:56.277 --> 24:58.801
a class difference that you
can't fake with fancy clothes.

24:58.845 --> 24:59.976
[laughs]:
No.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.456
As usual, the
De Vilbis family

25:01.500 --> 25:02.849
is questioning breeding,

25:02.892 --> 25:05.199
as they have done ever
since Patty's birth.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.548
But after today's race,

25:06.592 --> 25:08.332
I think you'll
all be wondering,

25:08.376 --> 25:11.597
"Is this the same Leonora
we've heard about?"

25:11.640 --> 25:13.947
[reporters continue chattering,
lively pop music playing]

25:13.990 --> 25:16.297
REPORTER:
Jeff? Jeff?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.168
You were recently spotted
leaving the hospital.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.779
Is there any truth
to the rumors

25:19.822 --> 25:21.258
that your mysterious
medical condition

25:21.302 --> 25:23.086
was brought on by
your mission to Mars?

25:23.130 --> 25:24.914
Yeah, I didn't actually
go to Mars.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.047
So, uh...Okay, but how are you feeling?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.483
Uh, what's your next step?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.485
And who's your date?
LUNA:
I got this.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.228
Who needs Mars
when you have Luna?

25:35.272 --> 25:37.361
Accessories by Dom-Mystique.Oh.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.581
[reporters clamoring,
cameras clicking]

25:42.584 --> 25:44.281
[phone beeps, vibrates]

25:46.196 --> 25:47.720
It's the makeup company.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.243
Looks like Sasha got the gig.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.114
[sighs]

25:51.158 --> 25:52.115
Oh.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.595
And so did you.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.205
Oh, my God, really?[laughs]

25:55.249 --> 25:58.252
That is so not a nice way
to tell someone good news.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.514
I thought it was funny.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.734
This is amazing.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.518
I don't know how to thank you.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.128
Keep doing
what you're doing.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.826
I told you
I'm all about second chances,

26:06.869 --> 26:08.218
and you're proving me right.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.306
Just like Sasha.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.221
We should tell her, too.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.528
Oh, she's probably in the middle
of her all-day spa treatment

26:13.572 --> 26:15.269
before her hot date
with your friend,

26:15.312 --> 26:17.227
the one who owns this place.Wait, Culhane?

26:17.271 --> 26:19.403
That's the one.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.101
Why? Is that a problem?

26:21.144 --> 26:24.626
No, but it's about to be.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.715
Thank you.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.805
And thank you for
distracting those reporters.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.416
As well as me.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.680
That is a solid use of
Dom-Mystique accessories.

26:34.723 --> 26:35.898
My mother's gonna
be thrilled.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.683
Tell her it was my pleasure.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.423
And if memory
serves me right,

26:39.467 --> 26:40.860
you owe me more than bubbly.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.557
I always pay my debts.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.647
Until I get my brisket,

26:45.691 --> 26:48.781
how about
we settle up like this?

26:52.828 --> 26:54.351
Uh, I'm just not ready yet.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.397
That whole "getting my
life in order" thing

26:56.440 --> 26:58.138
applies to everything,

26:58.181 --> 27:01.228
including not dating
until I feel settled.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.925
I just don't want
to do that to you.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.580
Well, I'm a big girl.
I can handle myself.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.756
And I can wait.
Though not too long.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.454
Once those pictures of me
hit Hot Tea Atlanta,

27:10.498 --> 27:12.500
who knows what kind of offers
I'll be fielding?

27:12.543 --> 27:13.849
[chuckles]

27:13.893 --> 27:16.896
[bugle playing
"Call to the Post"]

27:16.939 --> 27:19.681
Sam is polishing off
his second peach julep

27:19.725 --> 27:21.204
and told me
that you wagered

27:21.248 --> 27:22.815
your entire publishing
division on this race?

27:22.858 --> 27:24.338
It's fine. Don't worry.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
"Don't worry"? Nothing
makes me worry more

27:26.427 --> 27:27.689
than when you say
"don't worry."

27:27.733 --> 27:29.212
And if you're saying
"don't worry,"

27:29.256 --> 27:30.692
that means you know
that you're gonna win.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.346
The only way you could know that
is if you pulled

27:32.389 --> 27:34.696
some sort of Fallon trickery
on an innocent horse.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.393
If you pulled some sort of
Fallon trickery

27:36.437 --> 27:39.701
on an innocent horse,
I don't want to know about it.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.704
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.272
The only trickery I pulled
was convincing myself

27:45.315 --> 27:47.970
to put my trust
into someone other than myself.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.364
So let's hope that Daniel
knows what he's doing.

27:50.407 --> 27:53.280
Otherwise, Patty may be
your next publisher.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.632
Just coming here
is half the battle.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.242
The first step in
any new marriage

27:59.286 --> 28:00.722
is admitting
you need help.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.898
Uh, maybe you need help
because we're not married.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.334
Adam is my son.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.032
And business partner.
We just need to

28:06.075 --> 28:07.903
smooth things out
so we can coexist in peace.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.775
And also so my boyfriend
sees me trying.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.298
Got it. Uh, apologies.

28:11.341 --> 28:12.908
The emergency session
made me think

28:12.952 --> 28:14.780
this was a domestic dispute.It is.

28:14.823 --> 28:15.868
He cheated on me.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.173
[sighs] I did not.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.914
Okay, now I'm even
more confused.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
You cheated on our company.Because you stole my drug.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.222
Because you framed me
for murder.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.137
Because you paid someone
to break up me and Kirby.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.312
Okay, uh,

28:25.355 --> 28:27.401
the session is
only 45 minutes.

28:27.444 --> 28:31.231
As much I appreciate
a litany of grievances,

28:31.274 --> 28:32.841
perhaps a truce
is what's needed, yeah?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.538
I already truced.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.454
And that's after he
burned my face off.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.152
I don't think
hyperbolic metaphors...

28:39.195 --> 28:40.631
Burning your face

28:40.675 --> 28:43.025
was the only way I could
get you to listen to me.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.419
And it only lasted
until the gauze was removed.

28:45.462 --> 28:48.335
Okay, so apparently
not a metaphor.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.598
Clearly there are some

28:50.641 --> 28:53.644
deep wounds, uh,
between the two of you,

28:53.688 --> 28:57.039
but the good news is, uh,
none of them seem unfixable.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.433
You just need to do the work

28:59.476 --> 29:01.478
and be honest
about your feelings.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.785
Which clearly isn't an issue.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.179
It is for her
because she won't admit

29:06.222 --> 29:07.746
the real truth.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.617
The worst thing
she's ever done to me.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.184
Okay, meaning?

29:11.227 --> 29:14.404
Meaning that when I was
kidnapped as a child,

29:14.448 --> 29:15.884
she stopped looking for me.

29:17.364 --> 29:21.585
She gave up on me then,
so I'm giving up on her now.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.762
[door opens, closes]

29:28.027 --> 29:29.680
ANNOUNCER: And they're off
in the Peachtree Stakes.

29:29.724 --> 29:30.943
Fairly even break.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.596
Allegra stumbled a bit
coming out of the gate.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.903
Leonora, Nate to Wire
and Long Gone Sean

29:34.947 --> 29:36.209
jump to the early lead.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.340
She's supposed to be
closer to the lead.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.777
I knew I should've
spoken to the jockey.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.082
Freakin' Daniel!

29:40.126 --> 29:41.475
I love the color
of her silks, though.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.781
Oh, I know.
Aren't they great?Yeah.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.347
Come on, girl!

29:44.391 --> 29:45.392
ANNOUNCER: As they race
down the backstretch,

29:45.435 --> 29:46.828
it's still Leonora in front,

29:46.872 --> 29:48.874
followed by Nate to Wire
and Long Gone Sean.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.266
Okay, all right.
That's it, girl.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.615
Keep moving.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.835
Chelsea and Derby Dreams
also right there.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.750
As they reach the far turn
and head for home,

29:55.794 --> 29:58.187
it's still Leonora in front
and Nate to Wire a close second

29:58.231 --> 30:00.189
with Allegra four wide
and now in seventh

30:00.233 --> 30:01.843
with some ground to make up.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.540
Damn it.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.847
I'm firing your father
as soon as this race is over.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
...but Allegra is absolutely
flying on the outside.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.851
Derby Dreams and Chelsea
also making a run.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.854
Oh, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

30:12.898 --> 30:15.291
Allegra on the outside
and Derby Dreams between horses.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.728
Leonora is done and Allegra
puts her nose in front!

30:17.772 --> 30:20.993
And as they hit the wire,
it's Allegra...[cheering wildly]

30:21.036 --> 30:23.169
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.780
See? Sometimes
trust pays off.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.390
FALLON:
Yeah.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.479
Sure does.

30:29.523 --> 30:30.698
...for owner Fallon Carrington!

30:33.353 --> 30:34.833
[sighs] What are you doing?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.399
What's it look like?

30:36.443 --> 30:38.619
I'm going.
Can't fight anymore.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.360
You-you stole my dream
and my childhood.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.404
You win.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.667
Adam, please. Don't do this.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.365
Don't worry. I'm leaving
behind my drug research.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.975
You can give it
to your new company doctor.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.630
But these books, yeah,
they're actually mine.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.197
I don't care about any of that.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.590
I care about you.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.810
I want you to stay.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.466
I'm dropping the lawsuit
like I said I would.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.120
If you were paying
any attention,

31:01.163 --> 31:02.861
you'd realize this is about
more than the lawsuit.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.515
But you just...
you don't seem to get that.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.603
You were wrong.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.128
I never gave up looking for you.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.478
But I had
to give up hope.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.436
Because the heartache
of carrying that around

31:13.480 --> 31:16.570
for so long
eventually would've killed me.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.485
And when you came back,

31:18.528 --> 31:23.142
I should have been more clear
about how much you mean to me.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.928
Um...

31:26.972 --> 31:28.887
I want to apologize, too.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.977
For framing you for murder.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.241
I panicked.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.592
And some of
the other stuff, too.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.646
Without you,
there is no Alexam.

31:49.690 --> 31:53.085
It's just "Alex,"
and that doesn't mean anything.

31:53.128 --> 31:57.089
Yeah, I do think our therapy
session was a good first step.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.918
I think Dr. Bronner's right.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.528
We should talk more.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.095
I agree.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.706
But there's someone else
I need to talk to tonight.

32:05.749 --> 32:06.968
[sighs]

32:07.012 --> 32:08.970
I just hope it's not too late.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.974
These accessories looked
amazing in the pictures.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.628
Thank you for doing that for me.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.934
Of course.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.979
You know what else was amazing?Mm?

32:18.023 --> 32:19.589
You and that Luna together.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.593
Those HTApics of her
were killer.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.987
I'm naming a hat...

32:26.031 --> 32:27.467
"The Luna."

32:27.510 --> 32:28.990
[both laugh]

32:29.034 --> 32:31.732
Yeah, she's, uh...
she's pretty special.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.603
So I assume

32:33.647 --> 32:35.954
there's something going on
between you two?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.520
Mm. We are just friends, okay?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.000
Nothing more.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.089
I'm not in a headspace
to date right now.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.049
What?

32:44.092 --> 32:48.140
I don't give a flying fedora
about your headspace.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.664
And I'm sure
Luna doesn't either.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.448
Okay, look,
I wore your accessories.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.102
I don't also need your advice,
all right?

32:54.146 --> 32:55.799
Then take your own.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.019
When I wasn't ready
to start an accessories line,

32:58.063 --> 33:00.021
you convinced me to jump in.

33:00.065 --> 33:04.112
There will always be a reason
to stop you from taking a risk.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.812
Yeah. You might be right.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.901
I know I'm right.

33:10.945 --> 33:14.166
And if you don't ask
that cute girl out,

33:14.209 --> 33:18.692
Culhane will just snatch her up
since he's looking for a wife.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.870
I'll call her right now.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.047
I can't believe you went behind
my back and asked Sasha out.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.527
Hey, calm down.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.355
She asked me out,
and, yes, I did agree to go.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.052
That's the same thing.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.402
Really? Is it the same thing
as you dating your agent?

33:33.446 --> 33:34.838
Which you didn't even
bother to tell me,

33:34.882 --> 33:36.449
maybe because you knew
you'd look like a hypocrite.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.277
I am not a hypocrite.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.019
Oh, so you can mix business
and pleasure whenever you want

33:41.062 --> 33:42.063
and no one else can?

33:42.107 --> 33:43.108
Seems hypocritical.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.457
That's completely different.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.415
You didn't ask me
not to date Charlie.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.200
How could I? I don't know her.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.853
And I wouldn't have
even if I did.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.117
Oh, no, you just
would've been all judgy.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.163
No. I'm a good friend,
and good friends don't judge.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.513
And you know what else
good friends don't do?

33:57.557 --> 34:00.821
Stop each other from going after
something that makes them happy.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.737

I got a date to go to.

BLAKE:
Ah, looks like betting

34:08.568 --> 34:11.223

wasn't a bad idea.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.833
Well, Fallon
must be thrilled.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.226
This was you, wasn't it?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.316
You're gonna have to be a
little bit more specific.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.319
My wife just got a job offer
too good to pass up,

34:20.362 --> 34:23.757
a high-level position at
the American embassy in Iceland.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.367
Hmm.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
I know you used your connections
to make that happen.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.892
Well, I'm out of politics,
and the only thing I know

34:28.936 --> 34:31.982
about Iceland is that it's green
and Greenland is icy.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.115
Right? [chuckles]

34:34.159 --> 34:36.813
But seems to me that you should
be happy for your wife.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.337
Oh, um,

34:38.380 --> 34:40.121
I picked these up for you.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.037
'Cause you're gonna need them,
you know, in Iceland.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.822
I should've known
you'd have daddy step in

34:45.866 --> 34:47.694
to protect you.Yeah, you should thank her,

34:47.737 --> 34:49.609
because she talked me
out of having you blackballed,

34:49.652 --> 34:52.002
which I could've done faster
than you can say "Reykjavík."

34:52.046 --> 34:53.787
And all you had to do

34:53.830 --> 34:55.658
was not be a pompous jerk.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.443
But at least
you've learned now that

34:57.486 --> 35:00.881

you threaten all of us.

35:03.753 --> 35:06.278

a bad case of second-itis.

Oh, don't gloat, Fallon.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.112
It makes you look haggard.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.287
Or more haggard.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.853
No more barbs.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.551
I'm here to pay and sashay.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.596
No offense, but I don't take
personal checks.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.250
I'll have the funds
wired to you.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.991
Actually, don't.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.645
I don't want
your money.

35:25.688 --> 35:29.475

so send it directly to HHF.

Now that I'm the queen bee,

35:30.954 --> 35:32.260
I have to look out
for the foundation.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.176
That's very graysh.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.179
Does this mean I can keep
the seventh grade trophy?

35:51.236 --> 35:53.803
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Luna Moreno.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.370
I, uh, spoke
to her mother,

35:55.414 --> 35:58.243
who said she had to be
readmitted earlier.

Uh, yes, she was here.

Uh, she was admitted
around 5:00 p.m.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.170
But I'm sorry.

36:13.258 --> 36:16.261
Luna was in
end-stage renal failure,

I haven't shown you yet.

36:32.799 --> 36:33.974

But seeing as how
you're sticking around,

more time to explore.

Take a trip somewhere fun?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.384
I wish.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.386
I can hardly afford
a plane ticket

36:54.429 --> 36:56.344
after Charlie takes her cut.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.041
Really?

36:58.085 --> 36:59.695
Doesn't she just take like
ten or fifteen percent?

36:59.739 --> 37:01.828
Way more than that.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.960
But I didn't have a choice
when she signed me.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.789
I was basically
untouchable for a while.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.922
Long story.[chuckles]

37:08.965 --> 37:10.837

a second chance,
slash, last chance.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.843
And I'm still paying for it.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.323
Mm.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.718
Is Kirby getting
the same kind of raw deal?Probably.

37:22.762 --> 37:26.548
Her career was basically dead
before Charlie came along.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.117
You should warn her
to read the fine print.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.643
I know it's not the best thing
for a new relationship

37:34.687 --> 37:37.255

in the form of a kid,

and I am sorry
for the drama.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.655
So if you're going to dump me,
do it now.

thank you for the therapy rec.

from now on.

for as long as you want.

Okay, but let me go first. Um...

Okay, but let
me go away.

But I do have cancer.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.203
You saw me
taking medication

39:40.247 --> 39:43.424
for my treatment,
but I-I don't want you to worry.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.817
I'm on the mend, huh?

39:51.780 --> 39:54.087
Kelly, I've given it
some thought,

39:54.130 --> 39:56.785
and as much as
I hate to say it...

39:56.829 --> 40:00.441
I think I want to give you
a second chance.

40:01.964 --> 40:05.054
I know what it's like to be
backed into a corner and panic,

40:05.098 --> 40:09.232

instinct and letting you stay.

But, Kelly, if you ever
cross me again,

40:14.107 --> 40:16.414
there will not be
a third chance.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.462
You're giving Kelly
another shot?

Wow.

I could have destroyed
her and Patty,

40:26.772 --> 40:30.079

winning isn't everything.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.778
I mean, it's mostly everything,

40:32.821 --> 40:35.520

goes a long way.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.218
That's very evolved of you.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.438
And now that Allegra has won
her first stakes race,

40:40.481 --> 40:41.830
we can race her
a couple more times

40:41.874 --> 40:43.484
and then start breeding her.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.487
Ooh. Well, as long as
we're discussing breeding,

40:46.531 --> 40:49.621

to starting our own bloodline?

Oh, I love it when you
horse-talk to turn me on.

she was in renal failure,

41:08.988 --> 41:11.164
It is.

is that she couldn't afford

the long-term drugs
needed to keep her alive.

a handful of days left

in the hospital.
