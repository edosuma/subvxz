WEBVTT

00:05.483 --> 00:07.268
â™ª

00:07.311 --> 00:08.834
ANNOUNCER [over tablet]:
And they're off.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.272
Leonora broke well and goes
to the lead, followed by...

00:11.315 --> 00:13.926
Mmm. I smell...

00:13.970 --> 00:16.059
honeydew?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.321
Where are the bagels
and bacon?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.454
I asked Mrs. Gunnerson
to serve a lighter fare

00:19.497 --> 00:20.716
in prep for the race tomorrow.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.544
Look at this, Sammy Jo.
It's dragon fruit.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.024
Try some.
You'll love it.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.721
You may be competing to be
America's Next Top Model,

00:25.764 --> 00:26.678
but I'm not.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.724
And unless I'm
riding Allegra

00:28.767 --> 00:30.900
in tomorrow's race, I'm not sure
why I have to eat like her.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.729
We need to eat light
so Allegra can feel light

00:33.772 --> 00:34.904
and win the race.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.427
It's all about
being one with the horse.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.646
I'd rather be one
with an omelet.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.169
[Fallon gasps]

00:39.213 --> 00:41.128
How is my soon-to-be champion?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
Oh, Allegra's training great.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.045
Breezed four furlongs
in 48 flat.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.394
Hi, Sam.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.351
Hey.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.396
FALLON:
So, Daniel,

00:48.439 --> 00:49.962
I've noticed that
Patty's horse,

00:50.006 --> 00:51.660
Leonora, likes to
go to the lead.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.183
Allegra should be
using her early speed.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.619
Should I go talk
to the jockey?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.404
He knows what to do.
Trust me.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.319
Well, that's not gonna happen.
It's not that I don't

00:58.362 --> 01:00.277
trust you specifically.
It's that I don't trust anyone.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.713
You know what?

01:01.757 --> 01:03.889
Why don't you and I just
go talk to Allegra herself.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.630
It'll make me feel
better. Come on.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.852
[sighs]
Let's go and get waffles.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.811
Fruit is an appetizer at best,
but it's really not...

01:12.855 --> 01:14.074
Daniel's a drug addict.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.424
I saw him shooting up
at the stables.

01:16.467 --> 01:17.468
Shooting up?

01:17.512 --> 01:19.296
Wow. Wow.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.517
Yeah, "wow" is great and all,
but I could use some advice.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.085
He didn't see me,
but I'm freaking out.

01:25.128 --> 01:28.131
Okay, um, you need
to confront him.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.786
Well, I can't do anything now.
You heard Fallon.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.483
If she finds out,
she's gonna fire him,

01:32.527 --> 01:34.094
and then he's gonna
have to go to Venezuela,

01:34.137 --> 01:35.878
and I don't want to lose him;
I just met him.

01:35.921 --> 01:40.012
If this gets out of hand,
you will lose him.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.623
And it'll be much worse.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.713
As soon as the race is over,
I will talk to him.

01:44.756 --> 01:47.585
Dr. Leonard, uh,
I wanted you to meet Dr. Rosen.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.284
He's one of our fellows who
wants to specialize in oncology.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.938
You interrupted
my day for this?

01:52.982 --> 01:55.115
Does he want an autograph
or something?

01:55.158 --> 01:56.159
How do you spell "Rosen"?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.596
Will you just excuse us
for a second?

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
Um, that was a little rude.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.036
Oh, believe me,
that was nothing.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.865
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
for pulling you away,

02:06.909 --> 02:09.303
but, um, this hospital
is being sued.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.174
A patient is accusing
one of our attendings

02:11.218 --> 02:13.263
of improper behavior
during a exam.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.178
Mm. And this affects me how?

02:15.222 --> 02:17.963
It affects everyone because
we're implementing a rule

02:18.007 --> 02:20.052
mandating that all doctors
must have a third party present

02:20.096 --> 02:21.489
while seeing a patient.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.317
Yeah, if I wanted to be
followed around

02:23.360 --> 02:25.797
by a sycophantic teenager,
I'd work at a teaching hospital

02:25.841 --> 02:27.234
or, uh, Disney World.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.584
So no thanks.Um, sorry.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.063
Refusing is not an option.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.370
I think I just did.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.375
Oh, this isn't over.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.072
[whispers]:
There's no one here.[gasps]

02:40.116 --> 02:42.292
You're talking to yourself.
You know that, right?

02:42.336 --> 02:44.512
I was discussing a matter
with Dr. Leonard

02:44.555 --> 02:45.730
before he walked off.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.905
Ooh. What kind of matter?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.516
A not-your-business matter.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.908
You could tell me but you'd
have to kill me kind of thing?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.780
Oh, if that were true,
I'd tell you right now.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.477
Adorable.
Mm.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.176
So, are you going
to Fallon's big race tomorrow?

02:56.219 --> 02:57.220
No, I have to miss it.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.743
You'll have to survive
without me.

02:58.787 --> 02:59.788
Oh, I'm not going.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.355
I don't believe in horse racing.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.878
Or Fallon.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.445
I was just hoping
not to have to see you here.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.316
Well, bad luck for you, then.Yeah.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.538
Well, that's a giant weight
off my shoulders.

03:10.581 --> 03:13.410
Getting a clean bill of health
is all I could hope for.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.544
Okay, sounds like you had
the neurotox scan, not me.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.373
But I appreciate
your support, as always.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.593
Speaking of support,
I have a favor to ask.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.334
Mm?I'm ready to launch

03:24.378 --> 03:26.293
Dom-Mystique's
new accessories line.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.251
That's great news.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.340
It'll be greater
if you wear some of the pieces

03:30.384 --> 03:32.255
at the racetrack tomorrow.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.301
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm even going,

03:34.344 --> 03:36.303
and, uh, I kind of have
my own style.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.741
This accessory line
was your idea.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.046
What happened to supporting me?

03:41.090 --> 03:42.874
Can't you ask someone else?

03:42.918 --> 03:45.834
No. This will be your first
public outing in a long time.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.315
Reporters and social media
will love it.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.968
Yeah, okay, okay. For you, fine.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.709
But I'm not wearing
anything bedazzled.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.797
I like bedazzle.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.147
Is that Jeff Colby?Luna?

03:55.191 --> 03:56.584
[laughs] Hey.

03:56.627 --> 03:57.802
[laughs]Hey.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.151
[clears throat]

03:59.195 --> 04:00.283
Uh, right.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.111
Mom, Luna.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.591
Luna this is my
mom, Dominique.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.419
Luna and I were patients
here at the same time.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.724
It's nice to meet you.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.902
A mother knows when a third
wheel is one too many.

04:11.816 --> 04:12.904
Are you, uh...

04:12.948 --> 04:14.645
Yep. Finally checking out

04:14.689 --> 04:17.082
after a six-month stint
in neurotox detox.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.084
[chuckles]
I'm happy for you.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.565
Any big plans?What, besides doing cartwheels
in the grass?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.654
[chuckles]Not a one.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.482
[sighs] Damn. I, uh...

04:25.526 --> 04:27.702
I wish I could catch up more,
but I actually have to run.

04:27.745 --> 04:28.790
But we should...

04:28.833 --> 04:30.792
Make plans for tonight.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.315
You know I don't like goodbyes.

04:33.403 --> 04:36.101
Do you have some board games
and a hazy IPA?

04:36.145 --> 04:40.280
I have a fireplace
and bottles of Sancerre?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.324
That'll work.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.543
I'll see you tonight.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.109
See you tonight.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.027
There's that vision in red
I've been waiting to see.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.032
What do you say
to a romantic lunch for two?

04:54.076 --> 04:56.861
I say I love spontaneity,

04:56.905 --> 04:59.299
but I have a meeting
with my social media director.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.996
We actually did have a plan.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.084
Yeah, Friday.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.173
It is Friday.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.653
[groans]:
Oh.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.698
I must have double-booked.

05:07.742 --> 05:11.093
With Alexam's launch next week,
I'm swamped.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.616
It's fine. I get it.
You're busy.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.663
And there is a packaging issue
I'm trying to resolve.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.578
Packaging issue?

05:17.621 --> 05:19.275
We ordered ten cases
of two-ounce jars,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.669
but received ten cases
of five-ounce jars instead.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.148
So have them send you
the right size.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.717
Oh, it's complicated,
and it's Adam's purview.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
But he's been MIA.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.026
Probably secretly dating
some Buckhead socialite.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.636
Good for him.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.117
I'm being blown off
by my socialite girlfriend.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.424
Did you use the "G" word?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.643
Oh, sorry.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.471
Should it be "woman friend"?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.299
"Lady friend"?[laughs]

05:43.343 --> 05:47.390
We can discuss all of
the options at dinner tonight.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.741
"Dinner with boyfriend."

05:50.785 --> 05:52.917
Wow.

05:53.962 --> 05:57.357
"Producer's Guide
to Filmmaking."

05:57.400 --> 05:59.924
Does your boss know you're
looking for other jobs?

05:59.968 --> 06:01.926
He does because...

06:03.667 --> 06:05.147
...him I am.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.975
[chuckles]
Okay. I'm talking like Yoda.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.411
[laughs]

06:08.455 --> 06:10.065
Sorry about that. [laughs]
Checking in?

06:10.108 --> 06:12.546
Yes. Sasha Harris.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
Okay.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.810
Would you look at that.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.856
The boss has upgraded you
to a suite.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.641
Five-star service.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.730
I'll be sure to leave
a glowing review.

06:22.773 --> 06:26.298
Wait a minute.
You drive a vintage Porsche?

06:26.342 --> 06:29.432
I do. A 1964 911.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.130
Six-cylinder flat engine.
Top speed...

06:32.174 --> 06:35.917
Of 130,
though I've only hit 110.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.136
What a beauty.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.224
Indeed.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.443
KIRBY:Sasha!

06:40.487 --> 06:42.053
Hey! [laughs]

06:42.097 --> 06:43.272
You two know each other?

06:43.315 --> 06:44.708
Yeah, we have the same agent.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.580
She got us a test
for a big makeup campaign.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.452
Uh, let me just settle in to my
suite, and then we can hang out.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.584
Cool.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.369
Hey.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.067
[chuckles]
This is perfect.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.765
Now you can hook us up.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.289
[laughs] I could, but I won't.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.682
Why not?

07:01.725 --> 07:04.032
I'm supposed to be
looking for Ms. Culhane.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.512
What if she's the one?

07:05.555 --> 07:06.817
First of all,
Sasha's not the one

07:06.861 --> 07:08.384
because she'd never
change her name.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.299
And second of all,
which is also last of all,

07:10.342 --> 07:12.127
I don't mix business
and pleasure.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.824
Well, that's perfect.
You can stick to business,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.304
and I'll stick to the pleasure.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.611
Setting up my closest friend
with a colleague

07:17.654 --> 07:19.003
is a recipe for disaster,

07:19.047 --> 07:20.396
because when you two
break it off,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.833
it's only uncomfortable
for me, not you.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.269
I haven't even
gone out with her yet.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.488
How are we already breaking up?

07:25.532 --> 07:26.663
Well, look at it this way.

07:26.707 --> 07:27.969
You don't have to
break up with her

07:28.012 --> 07:29.187
because I don't want you
to date her.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.362
You're welcome.

07:32.495 --> 07:36.281
So Linda wasn't responsible
for the Morell site spill?

07:37.369 --> 07:40.068
The-the woman you-you fired,
rehired and refired?

07:40.111 --> 07:41.112
No, she was.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.679
Jeff found out that she was

07:42.723 --> 07:44.855
taking her orders
from Kelly, my VP,

07:44.899 --> 07:46.640
but apparently
Kelly only did it because

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
she was being blackmailed
by Patty De Vilbis.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.078
And Jeff told you that?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.688
No, Kelly just did. Keep up.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.995
So now what?
Are you gonna fire Kelly?

07:54.038 --> 07:55.300
I don't know.
She seemed so pathetic

07:55.344 --> 07:56.737
and apologetic over the phone.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.086
But I can't think
about Kelly right now

07:58.129 --> 07:59.653
because Patty is coming.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.655
No, Fallon.
You need to stay away from her.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.700
She's toxic.

08:03.744 --> 08:04.919
Oh, no pun intended, I'm sure.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.224
Oh.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.399
Cute hat.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.966
Thank you.
I got it, uh...

08:09.010 --> 08:10.664
You can go, sweetie.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
And so can that hat.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.150
What do you want?

08:19.194 --> 08:22.110
I heard about
your little toxic spill mishap.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.068
I'm impressed you're still
willing to show your face

08:24.112 --> 08:25.243
at the track tomorrow.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.767
Oh, I'll be there.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.638
And now I know it was you
who sabotaged Morell.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.118
This is when my legal team
would tell me

08:30.161 --> 08:31.511
to neither confirm
nor deny that.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.643
I know a lying liar
when I see one,

08:33.687 --> 08:36.777
especially one who wears white
before Memorial Day.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.083
So tell me why you're here
and then disappear.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.432
Gladly.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.086
I thought we could
make tomorrow's race

08:42.130 --> 08:43.784
a little more exciting
for both of us.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.612
Well, the race
isn't about us.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.004
It's about the horses.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.963
And I'm sure I will have
plenty of excitement

08:49.006 --> 08:49.964
in the winner's circle.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
I get it if you're nerv.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
I just thought
whoever's horse wins

08:53.750 --> 08:55.622
could get a cool one mil
from the other.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.188
Oh, Patty.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.364
I know that you need money
now that your daddy cut you off,

08:59.408 --> 09:01.279
but I just don't feel
comfortable cleaning you out.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.585
I'm not worried.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.153
Espesh if Allegra is
as big a loser as her owner.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.633
Hashtag second place,

09:06.676 --> 09:10.071
2006 Buckhead Equestrian Finals,
14 and under.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.639
You know what?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.945
I will take your streak
and your money

09:14.989 --> 09:16.947
just like
I took back Morell Green.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.035
Does this mean
we have a bet?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.080
We sure do.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.342
But make it
two million.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.909
Why not raise the stakes
even more?

09:21.952 --> 09:23.432
Loser also has to walk away

09:23.475 --> 09:25.477
from Heroic Hooves Foundation
forevs.

09:25.521 --> 09:29.003
Deal. And then I'll never
have to see you again.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.920
See you tomorrow.See you tomorrow.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.009
â™ª

09:43.583 --> 09:45.933
Sorry, we're late. I wanted
to check on the clinic,

09:45.976 --> 09:47.412
and we lost track of time.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.110
It's not a problem.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.765
Right, we had lunch plans.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.767
Um, right.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.290
Just give me a moment.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.248
I'm just gonna figure
out my schedule.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.077
Hmm, I love the way
the Brits say that.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.645
Clearly you forgot that
we were on your "schedule."

10:02.689 --> 10:04.516
Well, it's not really my fault.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.215
Dr. Leonard has been
a royal pain in my...

10:07.258 --> 10:08.738
"Arse"?[chuckles]

10:08.782 --> 10:09.783
[laughs] Sorry.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.567
What's going on?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.134
Well, he's just shown
a complete lack of respect

10:13.177 --> 10:14.788
for me as hospital counsel,

10:14.831 --> 10:16.616
and he's refusing to go along
with a new mandate.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.879
Well, we can take care
of this guy in one phone call.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.358
Just take a breath
before you call,

10:20.402 --> 10:22.578
like, a hit man or something.
[chuckles]

10:22.622 --> 10:24.536
I was gonna call one
of the board members,

10:24.580 --> 10:25.973
but maybe your
idea is better.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.758
No, I'd prefer if he wasn't
maimed or killed.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.543
Why not sit him down and
appeal to his compassionate side

10:31.587 --> 10:32.980
as a health care provider?

10:33.023 --> 10:35.112
It's good for the hospital,
good for him.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.637
Yep, I tried that,
and he mocked me

10:37.680 --> 10:39.639
and walked away
before I could finish.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.293
Well, then, maybe
let Blake do what he can.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.555
You say the word,

10:43.599 --> 10:44.774
I'll have this guy
on a one-way bus

10:44.818 --> 10:45.906
to Poughkeepsie
before the weekend's over.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.690
Thank you, but, um...

10:47.734 --> 10:49.823
I think I'm gonna
handle this myself.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.476
Diplomatically.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.827
Uh, Ms. Carrington,
I have some concerning news.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.480
Allegra hasn't eaten
since this morning.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.395
Well, then get her
some better tasting oats.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.136
It's not that simple.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.617
We're not sure what's causing
it, but I'm worried that

11:01.661 --> 11:03.488
it'll affect her race
if she's not eating by tomorrow.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.012
She's clearly not herself.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.883
Unless you would like
to look for a new job,

11:06.927 --> 11:08.232
you need to
get her back

11:08.276 --> 11:09.799
to being herself.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.280
This morning,
you told me that she was ready,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.455
and I trusted you.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.196
I cannot lose
this race to Patty.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.719
Okay? Especially not after

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
I've made
some very substantial wagers.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.418
The vet is on his way.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.768
We'll run some tests,
and I'll report back.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.772
He's doing
the best he can, okay?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.469
And you bet two million dollars.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.166
That's not exactly
substantial to you.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.951
It's not about the money.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.736
Whoever loses has to leave
the Heroic Hooves Foundation.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.085
So you find a new charity.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.174
What? I won't be
a charity hopper, Sam.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.002
Besides, HHF is

11:39.046 --> 11:42.223
where I started to evolve into
a... a better version of myself.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.529
If I turn my back on them now,
how will that look?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.357
So what are you gonna do?Well, it's obvious.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.359
If Allegra is not
gonna be able to race,

11:48.403 --> 11:50.535
I have to make sure
that Leonora can't race either.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.625
Please tell me the "obvious"
thing is not kidnapping a horse.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.976
No. I'm not insane.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717
I just have to make sure

11:57.760 --> 12:00.110
that Lenora gets disqualified
before the race tomorrow.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.939
I'll slip her a diuretic.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.767
So she has to pee
during the race?

12:04.811 --> 12:08.466
Diuretics are on the banned
substances list on race days.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.600
Fallon, this is
the better version of yourself?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.602
Killing a horse? Absolutely not!

12:13.645 --> 12:15.517
I'm not killing anything, Sam.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.475
She'll just fail
her prerace drug test

12:17.519 --> 12:18.738
and won't be able to race.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.913
She'll get the day off.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.175
Honestly,
she'll probably thank me.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.176
So are you in?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.439
Uh... no.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.140
Why am I the only one who knows
how to get anything done?

12:30.184 --> 12:31.489
ALEXIS:
Alexis Colby

12:31.533 --> 12:32.969
of Alexam Corp.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.884
I'm looking for
my social media director.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.887
She has that weird millennial
energy that looks like laziness

12:37.931 --> 12:40.150
and a name that kind of
sounds like a flower.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.631
This skin care product
is a game changer, Doctor.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.720
Your drugs are
a youth serum.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.811
And my concierge services are
also available for house calls.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.204
What the hell are you doing?

12:50.247 --> 12:52.859
Um, I'm accepting Nancy's Venmo.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.600
Though I also take
Zelle or PayPal.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.821
How dare you go off and start
a concierge doctor business?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.649
Well, that's a wrap,
ladies.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.825
This is what
you've been doing

13:02.869 --> 13:04.566
instead of dealing with
your Alexam commitments,

13:04.609 --> 13:06.220
including that
packaging disaster?

13:06.263 --> 13:10.006
Yes. And business is booming,
thanks for asking.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.227
I can't believe you would cheat
on our company for a few bucks.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.706
Oh, this is not about the money.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.491
This is about stopping you
from walking all over me.

13:16.534 --> 13:20.103
Remember, this new formula
is based on my antiaging drug.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.889
Correction: wasyour drug.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.325
Now it's mine,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.457
and I will not let you use it
without authorization.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.807
Try and stop me.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.244
Don't worry. I will.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.422
How's the wine?Oh, divine.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.771
[chuckles]

13:35.815 --> 13:37.164
Oh, a present?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.383
From a special someone?

13:39.427 --> 13:41.124
Not really.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.953
My mother's starting a new
accessories line, and I told her

13:43.997 --> 13:46.651
I would wear something
tomorrow at the racetrack.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.567
Jeff Colby is a gambler.

13:49.611 --> 13:50.873
Who knew?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.875
Do you know when to hold 'em?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.572
Uh, yeah, cute. No...

13:54.616 --> 13:55.965
Well, do you at least know
when to fold 'em?

13:56.009 --> 13:57.227
Actually, I prefer to walk away.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.012
I like being
in control.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.405
[R&B music playing quietly]

14:01.449 --> 14:04.104
These designs are sick.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.107
And I mean that
in the non-neurotoxicity way.

14:07.150 --> 14:11.502
Yeah. They may be, but, uh,
I'm-I'm thinking I may just pass

14:11.546 --> 14:12.852
on the whole
thing anyway.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.202
I'm not comfortable with that.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.465
Oh, because
you don't like a tie?

14:17.508 --> 14:18.596
I'm not buying it.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.729
What's the real
problem, Colby?

14:22.687 --> 14:28.476
Okay, uh, I'm just not ready
to be accosted by reporters,

14:28.519 --> 14:31.479
answering questions
about how I feel

14:31.522 --> 14:34.395
and-and what my
next plans are.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.180
I don't have any plans.

14:38.486 --> 14:42.751
I want to get my life in order
before I face the masses.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.972
You need to loosen up.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
[chuckles, whoops]

14:47.974 --> 14:50.541
Oh, oh, oh. Oh.[laughs]

14:50.585 --> 14:52.108
Uh, okay, it looks like

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
you're having a little too
much fun with the wine, yeah?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.677
Oh, you know
what would be more fun?
Mm?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.418
Is if you took me
to the races with you.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.247
I bet you I can keep the press
from asking you any questions.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.813
[sighs]

15:01.857 --> 15:04.773
But I'll need some of
Mama Colby's accessories.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.776
Yeah, that [chuckles]
shouldn't be a problem at all.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.693
If I win, you have to buy me
that barbecue brisket sandwich

15:11.736 --> 15:14.522
from Fat Larry's
I have been craving for months.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.263
And if I win?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.917
Trust me.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.570
You're not gonna win.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.702
Mm.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.921
Yeah, okay.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.052
We've had enough.[chuckles]

15:23.096 --> 15:24.880
FALLON [whispers]:
Hi.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.361
It's time
to take your vitamins.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.753
Don't worry.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.799
You won't even notice the taste.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.584
What do you think you're doing?

15:33.628 --> 15:35.543
Oh. Uh...

15:35.586 --> 15:37.327
[chuckles]

15:37.371 --> 15:39.199
I'm just donating
my valuable time

15:39.242 --> 15:42.245
to ensure that every horse
has enough carrots.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.594
Leonora shouldn't suffer

15:43.638 --> 15:44.900
just because
you can't afford food.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.988
She looks like
she's lost weight.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.729
That's because that's not her.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.470
I switched her out
with the lead pony

15:49.513 --> 15:51.559
because I was worried that
someone would try something.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.865
Really, Fal? Sinking to sabo?

15:55.215 --> 15:56.216
"Tage."

15:56.259 --> 15:58.870
I don't need to "sabo" anything.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.395
Allegra is the better horse.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.787
Then let's raise the bet.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.355
When Leonora wins, I want
Femperial Publishing.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.662
That way, I can
write a tell-all

16:07.705 --> 16:10.708
and tell all about poor little
rich girl Fallon Carrington.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.320
You can't even finish a word,
let alone a sentence.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.669
[chuckles]:
Don't worry.

16:14.712 --> 16:15.975
I have plenty of other ways
to humiliate you.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.152
I'm just not gonna tell you
what they are, obvi.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.849
Obvi.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.852
Well, while you may live
in your little fantasy world,

16:23.895 --> 16:26.246
we both know how this ends:
with Allegra winning.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.769
And when she does,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.640
I want the one thing
that started this war.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.121
I'm not sure what we can do
about Jeff taking my virginity.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.557
Ew, ew, no.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.603
I want the 14 and under
equestrian trophy

16:35.646 --> 16:37.561
that you clearly won
by cheating.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.216
A publishing house
for a dollar store knickknack?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.739
Deal.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.611
You know, I really am
a decent person,

16:43.654 --> 16:46.657
and all I wanted was a nice
little race between our horses.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.616
But since you dragged me
into this fight,

16:48.659 --> 16:50.270
prepare to get your ass kicked.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.755
[R&B music playing,
quiet chatter]

16:57.799 --> 16:59.670
Front desk clerk,

16:59.714 --> 17:02.064
film producer,
man behind the bar.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.196
What don't you do?

17:03.239 --> 17:04.675
Well, I was going for the whole

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
modern-day Renaissance man
kind of vibe.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.635
Well, you're killing it.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.289
[chuckles]

17:09.332 --> 17:11.508
Um, as long as you're back
there, is there any OJ?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.293
I'm trying to stave off a cold.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.252
Well, I'm actually a health
and fitness expert as well,

17:16.296 --> 17:17.862
and orange juice is a myth.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.168
But you're in luck.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.170
I have a preventative cure-all:

17:21.214 --> 17:24.391
apple cider vinegar
and a spoonful of cod liver oil.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.958
Now I really think
I'm gonna be sick. [laughs]

17:27.002 --> 17:28.047
Don't you trust me?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.658
Something tells me I do.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.965
But why don't we continue
our conversation

17:34.009 --> 17:37.012
about cars and cold remedies
over dinner?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.709
I would really like to,

17:38.753 --> 17:40.363
but I'm gonna be tied up
a little longer.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.148
Let's meet up
when you're untied.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.281
You know, tonight's
just not a good night.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.417
Okay, uh,
just to be clear,

17:50.460 --> 17:54.116
I'm a model, and I don't
ask a lot of men out.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.597
And when I do, they say yes.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.817
I really want to, but...

17:59.861 --> 18:01.819
I'm trying to be respectful
of Kirby's wishes.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.517
Which are what, exactly?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.910
She doesn't want to
make a situation messy

18:05.954 --> 18:08.652
by mixing business
with pleasure.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.915
[chuckles]
That doesn't even make sense.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.222
Especially considering
she's dating Charlie.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.530
Charli... XCX?

18:16.573 --> 18:18.488
Charlie, our agent.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.143
What? Oh, I get it.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
It's okay for her
to mix business and pleasure,

18:23.189 --> 18:24.190
just not me.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.321
Mm.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.456
I was thinking we can go
to this new high-end diner.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.066
Costs like 35 bucks
for a milkshake,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.415
but it's supposed
to be worth it.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.895
You know, what
I can't shake is

18:33.938 --> 18:36.158
Adam's complete
and utter betrayal.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.378
Can we please not talk
about Adam tonight?

18:38.421 --> 18:41.381
[sighs] Um, you're right.
I'm sorry.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.558
But starting a concierge
business behind my back?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.560
You're still talking about him.[elevator bell dings]

18:46.603 --> 18:48.344
ADAM:
Mother? You're suing me? No.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.173
Y-You can't sue your partner.
Or your son.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.566
I'm suing both.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.090
You're using proprietary
formulas I own.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.787
I can't believe
you would be so selfish

18:56.831 --> 18:58.746
to do this right before
our launch.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.139
I'm being selfish?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.618
You're the one
moonlighting in hotels

19:01.662 --> 19:03.272
and private homes
throughout Tuxedo Park!

19:03.316 --> 19:05.318
DEX:
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
take it down a notch, okay?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.189
Seriously, if you can't
deal with each other

19:07.233 --> 19:08.886
as mother and son,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.845
how in the hell will you be able
to run a business together?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.063
I'm not sure we can.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.587
[sighs]

19:13.630 --> 19:15.066
I've actually got a great
therapist who can help you

19:15.110 --> 19:16.546
figure this out.[laughs]

19:16.590 --> 19:18.331
I don't need a
therapist to tell me

19:18.374 --> 19:19.549
that I did
nothing wrong.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.334
Okay, I was serious.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.944
And that's not the best
attitude to make things better.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.380
Plus, your relationship
with Adam

19:24.424 --> 19:26.208
is starting
to cause issues in ours.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.470
All right, listen up, "Dux."

19:27.514 --> 19:29.472
This whole Dr. Phil thing is-is

19:29.516 --> 19:31.082
not gonna get you more money
from my mother.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.823
It's Dex.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.217
And I just made eight figures
last year, so I'm good.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.001
I like your mom,

19:37.045 --> 19:39.656
but I don't like being blown off
because of her childish son.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.223
Dex, what about dinner?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
I lost my appetite.

19:45.880 --> 19:46.924
I'm not gonna see a shrink.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.752
I don't want to either.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.407
But we do need help,
and I don't want to lose Dex.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.148
So if fixing this
with you

19:53.192 --> 19:55.672
will help me with him,
then that's what I want to do.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.413
And...

19:57.457 --> 20:00.460
if you agree to go,
I will drop the lawsuit.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.724
Can I get that in writing?You're just gonna
have to trust me.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.770
You will learn
all about that in therapy.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.731
[birds chirping]

20:10.774 --> 20:12.254
FALLON:Okay.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.604
After a sleepless night,
I have a new plan.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.040
Better not
involve removing

20:16.084 --> 20:17.694
any more breakfast meats
from the table.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.870
Since sabotage
didn't exactly pan out...

20:19.914 --> 20:21.307
Surprising exactly no one.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.265
...I have a new and better idea,

20:23.309 --> 20:25.789
inspired by
Patty's little stall switcheroo.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.877
If Allegra

20:26.921 --> 20:28.531
is not in top shape,

20:28.575 --> 20:30.098
I'll just secretly
switch horses.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.969
[laughs]

20:32.013 --> 20:33.536
Well, I mean,
you're kidding, right?

20:34.798 --> 20:36.104
This is a terrible idea, Fallon.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.584
It's not ideal. I know that.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.586
But it's not like
I had weeks to plan.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.370
I wrote this down in a haze
at 2:00 a.m.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.067
And all I need is Daniel's help

20:43.111 --> 20:44.895
and maybe a little shoe polish
to pull it off.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.810
He's not gonna help you.
He could lose his license.

20:46.854 --> 20:47.898
Besides,

20:47.942 --> 20:49.639
Allegra could be fine now.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.685
Maybe you should call before
you start painting horses.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.165
I did, but he didn't
get back to me.[phone vibrates, dings]

20:54.209 --> 20:55.254
What?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.951
What's wrong?

20:56.994 --> 20:58.474
Well, it's
the assistant trainer.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.259
The hot one or the married one?No, no, no.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.043
Daniel is missing
and apparently Allegra is, too.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.871
Has your father lost his mind?

21:03.914 --> 21:05.873
Okay, uh...

21:05.916 --> 21:07.396
I have to tell you something,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.224
and I should've probably

21:09.268 --> 21:10.921
told you sooner,
so don't freak out.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.009
Tell me.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.099
[grunts]

21:15.143 --> 21:17.058
You're like
a walking horror movie.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.147
You need to back off
of Dr. Leonard.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.670
What? Why?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.498
He's a top doctor
who brings in tons of revenue,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.805
so just let him do
whatever he wants.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.067
If he wants to operate

21:26.110 --> 21:28.069
by himself in a closet,
so be it.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.505
You have nothing
to do with this.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.420
I make the decisions here

21:31.464 --> 21:33.727
that are best for the hospital
because I'm the chief of staff.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.338
For now.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.560
Where have you been?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.213
Mm, I was just about
to call you.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.214
Oh, right.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.433
You know, I can't tell

21:44.477 --> 21:47.044
if you're lying
or if you're high or both.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.133
Wait, what are you
talking about?

21:49.177 --> 21:50.744
I know about your drug habit.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.181
Sam told me he saw you
shooting up in the stables

21:53.224 --> 21:54.748
in front of Allegra, okay?

21:54.791 --> 21:57.011
No wonder she's not eating.
Emotional trauma.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.142
I want you gone.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.014
This has nothing to do
with Allegra.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
You have to trust me.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.452
You keep saying that, but you're
not giving me any reason to,

22:03.496 --> 22:05.759
and now I have to go
paint a horse

22:05.802 --> 22:07.064
because of
your drug addiction.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.370
And don't give me
any excuses, okay?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.893
Because I'm really not
in the mood.

22:11.591 --> 22:12.679
I have cancer.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.507
What?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.726
I have cancer, and Sam must
have seen me injecting myself

22:16.770 --> 22:18.337
with immune boosters
after my treatment.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.991
Is that true? Does Sam know?

22:21.035 --> 22:23.080
It's true,
and-and Sam doesn't know.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.039
And please
don't tell him.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.736
Oh, the good news is
Allegra's fine.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.390
I took her for a walk
and realized

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
her shoes weren't fitting right.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.393
She wasn't comfortable
so she wasn't eating.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.916
But now that we have
the right shoes on,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.265
she's back to her old self.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.266
She can win.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.703
New shoes?

22:36.746 --> 22:38.444
That's a solution
Carrie Bradshaw could have

22:38.487 --> 22:40.315
come up with in five seconds.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.012
Do you see why it's a little
difficult for me to trust you?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.797
I do, but I'm your best shot.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.407
I know this horse.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.148
I love this horse.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.368
Don't sabotage Leonora
or s-start painting other ones,

22:49.411 --> 22:50.847
whatever that means.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.502
We can win the right way,
but it's your call.

22:53.546 --> 22:54.721
You're the owner.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.425
Hey.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.166
Is Blake around?

23:05.209 --> 23:07.560
No, he went to check on
construction for the airport.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.389
Oh, his airport.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.869
You know, sometimes I forget
what kind of family I'm in.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.001
I know.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.437
It can be crazy.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.047
But I can let him know
you stopped by.

23:17.091 --> 23:20.660
Actually, um, I was kind of
hoping to talk just to you.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.793
This Dr. Leonard problem,

23:23.837 --> 23:25.447
it just-- it isn't going away,

23:25.491 --> 23:28.407
and now Adam is
getting involved, and...

23:28.450 --> 23:30.017
I'm just not sure what to do.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.235
I think you are sure.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.064
You're avoiding
the obvious solution.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.849
Well, I don't want
to destroy a man's career

23:35.892 --> 23:37.241
because he won't follow a rule.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.721
But you're willing
to destroy yours?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.377
Because if he gets sued,
you'll also take the fall.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.944
But if I accept Blake's help,

23:43.987 --> 23:46.599
I'm just not sure I'm gonna
be able to sleep at night.

23:46.642 --> 23:51.081
The first time I ever did
some Carrington-like things,

23:51.125 --> 23:54.302
I had to take a sleeping pill
at night for a few weeks.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.611
But then,
one day, I realized,

23:58.654 --> 24:01.657
"Hey, you're not doing
anything wrong."

24:02.963 --> 24:06.401
When people come after us,
we need to fight back.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.795
So now I enjoy a glass

24:08.838 --> 24:12.494
of chilled champagne at bedtime
and sleep like a baby.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.888
And so will you. Trust me.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.326
Well, I have worked too hard
to let this bastard ruin it all.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.721
No one is going to hand you
power or respect, Amanda.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.767
You need to take it
and live with the consequences.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.040
Tell Blake I'm ready.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.303
Now, don't print that.[laughs]

24:39.347 --> 24:40.870
REPORTER:
Fallon? Fallon?

24:40.914 --> 24:42.219
Do you think you
have a chance today?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.525
How is Allegra feeling?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.396
Oh, Allegra is feeling great,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.138
and she'll be feeling
even better after she wins.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.314
I might even buy her
some new silks as a gift.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.360
Can we get a couple of
shots with the Oil Royals?

24:53.317 --> 24:56.233
Well, I'm sure Allegra is
feeling great, but there's just

24:56.277 --> 24:58.801
a class difference that you
can't fake with fancy clothes.

24:58.845 --> 24:59.976
[laughs]:
No.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.456
As usual, the
De Vilbis family

25:01.500 --> 25:02.849
is questioning breeding,

25:02.892 --> 25:05.199
as they have done ever
since Patty's birth.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.548
But after today's race,

25:06.592 --> 25:08.332
I think you'll
all be wondering,

25:08.376 --> 25:11.597
"Is this the same Leonora
we've heard about?"

25:11.640 --> 25:13.947
[reporters continue chattering,
lively pop music playing]

25:13.990 --> 25:16.297
REPORTER:
Jeff? Jeff?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.168
You were recently spotted
leaving the hospital.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.779
Is there any truth
to the rumors

25:19.822 --> 25:21.258
that your mysterious
medical condition

25:21.302 --> 25:23.086
was brought on by
your mission to Mars?

25:23.130 --> 25:24.914
Yeah, I didn't actually
go to Mars.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.047
So, uh...Okay, but how are you feeling?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.483
Uh, what's your next step?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.485
And who's your date?
LUNA:
I got this.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.228
Who needs Mars
when you have Luna?

25:35.272 --> 25:37.361
Accessories by Dom-Mystique.Oh.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.581
[reporters clamoring,
cameras clicking]

25:42.584 --> 25:44.281
[phone beeps, vibrates]

25:46.196 --> 25:47.720
It's the makeup company.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.243
Looks like Sasha got the gig.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.114
[sighs]

25:51.158 --> 25:52.115
Oh.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.595
And so did you.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.205
Oh, my God, really?[laughs]

25:55.249 --> 25:58.252
That is so not a nice way
to tell someone good news.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.514
I thought it was funny.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.734
This is amazing.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.518
I don't know how to thank you.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.128
Keep doing
what you're doing.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.826
I told you
I'm all about second chances,

26:06.869 --> 26:08.218
and you're proving me right.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.306
Just like Sasha.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.221
We should tell her, too.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.528
Oh, she's probably in the middle
of her all-day spa treatment

26:13.572 --> 26:15.269
before her hot date
with your friend,

26:15.312 --> 26:17.227
the one who owns this place.Wait, Culhane?

26:17.271 --> 26:19.403
That's the one.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.101
Why? Is that a problem?

26:21.144 --> 26:24.626
No, but it's about to be.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.715
Thank you.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.805
And thank you for
distracting those reporters.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.416
As well as me.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.680
That is a solid use of
Dom-Mystique accessories.

26:34.723 --> 26:35.898
My mother's gonna
be thrilled.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.683
Tell her it was my pleasure.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.423
And if memory
serves me right,

26:39.467 --> 26:40.860
you owe me more than bubbly.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.557
I always pay my debts.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.647
Until I get my brisket,

26:45.691 --> 26:48.781
how about
we settle up like this?

26:52.828 --> 26:54.351
Uh, I'm just not ready yet.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.397
That whole "getting my
life in order" thing

26:56.440 --> 26:58.138
applies to everything,

26:58.181 --> 27:01.228
including not dating
until I feel settled.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.925
I just don't want
to do that to you.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.580
Well, I'm a big girl.
I can handle myself.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.756
And I can wait.
Though not too long.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.454
Once those pictures of me
hit Hot Tea Atlanta,

27:10.498 --> 27:12.500
who knows what kind of offers
I'll be fielding?

27:12.543 --> 27:13.849
[chuckles]

27:13.893 --> 27:16.896
[bugle playing
"Call to the Post"]

27:16.939 --> 27:19.681
Sam is polishing off
his second peach julep

27:19.725 --> 27:21.204
and told me
that you wagered

27:21.248 --> 27:22.815
your entire publishing
division on this race?

27:22.858 --> 27:24.338
It's fine. Don't worry.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
"Don't worry"? Nothing
makes me worry more

27:26.427 --> 27:27.689
than when you say
"don't worry."

27:27.733 --> 27:29.212
And if you're saying
"don't worry,"

27:29.256 --> 27:30.692
that means you know
that you're gonna win.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.346
The only way you could know that
is if you pulled

27:32.389 --> 27:34.696
some sort of Fallon trickery
on an innocent horse.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.393
If you pulled some sort of
Fallon trickery

27:36.437 --> 27:39.701
on an innocent horse,
I don't want to know about it.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.704
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.272
The only trickery I pulled
was convincing myself

27:45.315 --> 27:47.970
to put my trust
into someone other than myself.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.364
So let's hope that Daniel
knows what he's doing.

27:50.407 --> 27:53.280
Otherwise, Patty may be
your next publisher.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.632
Just coming here
is half the battle.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.242
The first step in
any new marriage

27:59.286 --> 28:00.722
is admitting
you need help.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.898
Uh, maybe you need help
because we're not married.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.334
Adam is my son.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.032
And business partner.
We just need to

28:06.075 --> 28:07.903
smooth things out
so we can coexist in peace.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.775
And also so my boyfriend
sees me trying.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.298
Got it. Uh, apologies.

28:11.341 --> 28:12.908
The emergency session
made me think

28:12.952 --> 28:14.780
this was a domestic dispute.It is.

28:14.823 --> 28:15.868
He cheated on me.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.173
[sighs] I did not.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.914
Okay, now I'm even
more confused.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
You cheated on our company.Because you stole my drug.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.222
Because you framed me
for murder.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.137
Because you paid someone
to break up me and Kirby.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.312
Okay, uh,

28:25.355 --> 28:27.401
the session is
only 45 minutes.

28:27.444 --> 28:31.231
As much I appreciate
a litany of grievances,

28:31.274 --> 28:32.841
perhaps a truce
is what's needed, yeah?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.538
I already truced.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.454
And that's after he
burned my face off.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.152
I don't think
hyperbolic metaphors...

28:39.195 --> 28:40.631
Burning your face

28:40.675 --> 28:43.025
was the only way I could
get you to listen to me.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.419
And it only lasted
until the gauze was removed.

28:45.462 --> 28:48.335
Okay, so apparently
not a metaphor.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.598
Clearly there are some

28:50.641 --> 28:53.644
deep wounds, uh,
between the two of you,

28:53.688 --> 28:57.039
but the good news is, uh,
none of them seem unfixable.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.433
You just need to do the work

28:59.476 --> 29:01.478
and be honest
about your feelings.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.785
Which clearly isn't an issue.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.179
It is for her
because she won't admit

29:06.222 --> 29:07.746
the real truth.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.617
The worst thing
she's ever done to me.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.184
Okay, meaning?

29:11.227 --> 29:14.404
Meaning that when I was
kidnapped as a child,

29:14.448 --> 29:15.884
she stopped looking for me.

29:17.364 --> 29:21.585
She gave up on me then,
so I'm giving up on her now.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.762
[door opens, closes]

29:28.027 --> 29:29.680
ANNOUNCER: And they're off
in the Peachtree Stakes.

29:29.724 --> 29:30.943
Fairly even break.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.596
Allegra stumbled a bit
coming out of the gate.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.903
Leonora, Nate to Wire
and Long Gone Sean

29:34.947 --> 29:36.209
jump to the early lead.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.340
She's supposed to be
closer to the lead.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.777
I knew I should've
spoken to the jockey.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.082
Freakin' Daniel!

29:40.126 --> 29:41.475
I love the color
of her silks, though.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.781
Oh, I know.
Aren't they great?Yeah.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.347
Come on, girl!

29:44.391 --> 29:45.392
ANNOUNCER: As they race
down the backstretch,

29:45.435 --> 29:46.828
it's still Leonora in front,

29:46.872 --> 29:48.874
followed by Nate to Wire
and Long Gone Sean.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.266
Okay, all right.
That's it, girl.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.615
Keep moving.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.835
Chelsea and Derby Dreams
also right there.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.750
As they reach the far turn
and head for home,

29:55.794 --> 29:58.187
it's still Leonora in front
and Nate to Wire a close second

29:58.231 --> 30:00.189
with Allegra four wide
and now in seventh

30:00.233 --> 30:01.843
with some ground to make up.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.540
Damn it.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.847
I'm firing your father
as soon as this race is over.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
...but Allegra is absolutely
flying on the outside.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.851
Derby Dreams and Chelsea
also making a run.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.854
Oh, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

30:12.898 --> 30:15.291
Allegra on the outside
and Derby Dreams between horses.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.728
Leonora is done and Allegra
puts her nose in front!

30:17.772 --> 30:20.993
And as they hit the wire,
it's Allegra...[cheering wildly]

30:21.036 --> 30:23.169
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.780
See? Sometimes
trust pays off.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.390
FALLON:
Yeah.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.479
Sure does.

30:29.523 --> 30:30.698
...for owner Fallon Carrington!

30:33.353 --> 30:34.833
[sighs] What are you doing?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.399
What's it look like?

30:36.443 --> 30:38.619
I'm going.
Can't fight anymore.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.360
You-you stole my dream
and my childhood.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.404
You win.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.667
Adam, please. Don't do this.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.365
Don't worry. I'm leaving
behind my drug research.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.975
You can give it
to your new company doctor.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.630
But these books, yeah,
they're actually mine.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.197
I don't care about any of that.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.590
I care about you.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.810
I want you to stay.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.466
I'm dropping the lawsuit
like I said I would.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.120
If you were paying
any attention,

31:01.163 --> 31:02.861
you'd realize this is about
more than the lawsuit.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.515
But you just...
you don't seem to get that.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.603
You were wrong.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.128
I never gave up looking for you.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.478
But I had
to give up hope.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.436
Because the heartache
of carrying that around

31:13.480 --> 31:16.570
for so long
eventually would've killed me.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.485
And when you came back,

31:18.528 --> 31:23.142
I should have been more clear
about how much you mean to me.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.928
Um...

31:26.972 --> 31:28.887
I want to apologize, too.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.977
For framing you for murder.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.241
I panicked.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.592
And some of
the other stuff, too.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.646
Without you,
there is no Alexam.

31:49.690 --> 31:53.085
It's just "Alex,"
and that doesn't mean anything.

31:53.128 --> 31:57.089
Yeah, I do think our therapy
session was a good first step.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.918
I think Dr. Bronner's right.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.528
We should talk more.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.095
I agree.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.706
But there's someone else
I need to talk to tonight.

32:05.749 --> 32:06.968
[sighs]

32:07.012 --> 32:08.970
I just hope it's not too late.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.974
These accessories looked
amazing in the pictures.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.628
Thank you for doing that for me.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.934
Of course.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.979
You know what else was amazing?Mm?

32:18.023 --> 32:19.589
You and that Luna together.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.593
Those HTApics of her
were killer.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.987
I'm naming a hat...

32:26.031 --> 32:27.467
"The Luna."

32:27.510 --> 32:28.990
[both laugh]

32:29.034 --> 32:31.732
Yeah, she's, uh...
she's pretty special.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.603
So I assume

32:33.647 --> 32:35.954
there's something going on
between you two?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.520
Mm. We are just friends, okay?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.000
Nothing more.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.089
I'm not in a headspace
to date right now.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.049
What?

32:44.092 --> 32:48.140
I don't give a flying fedora
about your headspace.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.664
And I'm sure
Luna doesn't either.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.448
Okay, look,
I wore your accessories.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.102
I don't also need your advice,
all right?

32:54.146 --> 32:55.799
Then take your own.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.019
When I wasn't ready
to start an accessories line,

32:58.063 --> 33:00.021
you convinced me to jump in.

33:00.065 --> 33:04.112
There will always be a reason
to stop you from taking a risk.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.812
Yeah. You might be right.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.901
I know I'm right.

33:10.945 --> 33:14.166
And if you don't ask
that cute girl out,

33:14.209 --> 33:18.692
Culhane will just snatch her up
since he's looking for a wife.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.870
I'll call her right now.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.047
I can't believe you went behind
my back and asked Sasha out.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.527
Hey, calm down.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.355
She asked me out,
and, yes, I did agree to go.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.052
That's the same thing.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.402
Really? Is it the same thing
as you dating your agent?

33:33.446 --> 33:34.838
Which you didn't even
bother to tell me,

33:34.882 --> 33:36.449
maybe because you knew
you'd look like a hypocrite.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.277
I am not a hypocrite.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.019
Oh, so you can mix business
and pleasure whenever you want

33:41.062 --> 33:42.063
and no one else can?

33:42.107 --> 33:43.108
Seems hypocritical.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.457
That's completely different.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.415
You didn't ask me
not to date Charlie.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.200
How could I? I don't know her.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.853
And I wouldn't have
even if I did.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.117
Oh, no, you just
would've been all judgy.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.163
No. I'm a good friend,
and good friends don't judge.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.513
And you know what else
good friends don't do?

33:57.557 --> 34:00.821
Stop each other from going after
something that makes them happy.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.737
So if you'll excuse me,
I got a date to go to.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.826
[pop music playing quietly]

34:07.045 --> 34:08.524
BLAKE:
Ah, looks like betting

34:08.568 --> 34:11.223
a small country's GDP on Allegra
wasn't a bad idea.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.833
Well, Fallon
must be thrilled.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.226
This was you, wasn't it?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.316
You're gonna have to be a
little bit more specific.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.319
My wife just got a job offer
too good to pass up,

34:20.362 --> 34:23.757
a high-level position at
the American embassy in Iceland.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.367
Hmm.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
I know you used your connections
to make that happen.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.892
Well, I'm out of politics,
and the only thing I know

34:28.936 --> 34:31.982
about Iceland is that it's green
and Greenland is icy.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.115
Right? [chuckles]

34:34.159 --> 34:36.813
But seems to me that you should
be happy for your wife.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.337
Oh, um,

34:38.380 --> 34:40.121
I picked these up for you.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.037
'Cause you're gonna need them,
you know, in Iceland.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.822
I should've known
you'd have daddy step in

34:45.866 --> 34:47.694
to protect you.Yeah, you should thank her,

34:47.737 --> 34:49.609
because she talked me
out of having you blackballed,

34:49.652 --> 34:52.002
which I could've done faster
than you can say "ReykjavÃ­k."

34:52.046 --> 34:53.787
And all you had to do

34:53.830 --> 34:55.658
was not be a pompous jerk.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.443
But at least
you've learned now that

34:57.486 --> 35:00.881
if you threaten one Carrington,
you threaten all of us.

35:03.753 --> 35:06.278
[gasps] There she is.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.931
Are you feeling okay?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.673
I know you have
a bad case of second-itis.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.110
Oh, don't gloat, Fallon.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.112
It makes you look haggard.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.287
Or more haggard.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.853
No more barbs.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.551
I'm here to pay and sashay.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.596
No offense, but I don't take
personal checks.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.250
I'll have the funds
wired to you.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.991
Actually, don't.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.645
I don't want
your money.

35:25.688 --> 35:29.475
But I do want you to pay,
so send it directly to HHF.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.911
Now that I'm the queen bee,

35:30.954 --> 35:32.260
I have to look out
for the foundation.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.176
That's very graysh.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.179
Does this mean I can keep
the seventh grade trophy?

35:38.223 --> 35:40.007
[laughs] Have you gone banan?

35:40.050 --> 35:41.051
No way.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.705
But you can
come visit it

35:42.749 --> 35:45.360
once I have the rightful
winner's name engraved on it.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.803
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Luna Moreno.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.370
I, uh, spoke
to her mother,

35:55.414 --> 35:58.243
who said she had to be
readmitted earlier.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.549
How is she? Can she eat brisket?

36:00.593 --> 36:02.421
I-I know it'll make her
feel better.

36:03.422 --> 36:06.338
Uh, yes, she was here.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.254
Uh, she was admitted
around 5:00 p.m.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.170
But I'm sorry.

36:13.258 --> 36:16.261
Luna was in
end-stage renal failure,

36:16.304 --> 36:18.176
and she didn't make it.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.403
â™ª

36:28.447 --> 36:30.144
You really can do it all.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.755
Oh, I still have a few tricks
I haven't shown you yet.

36:32.799 --> 36:33.974
Mm.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.105
But seeing as how
you're sticking around,

36:35.149 --> 36:36.672
guess we have
more time to explore.

36:36.716 --> 36:41.373
I'm still not exploring that
vinegar-cod liver oil combo.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.375
All right. Your loss.[laughs]

36:43.418 --> 36:45.115
[laughs]

36:46.421 --> 36:49.250
So what are you gonna do
to celebrate this job?

36:49.294 --> 36:50.512
Take a trip somewhere fun?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.384
I wish.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.386
I can hardly afford
a plane ticket

36:54.429 --> 36:56.344
after Charlie takes her cut.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.041
Really?

36:58.085 --> 36:59.695
Doesn't she just take like
ten or fifteen percent?

36:59.739 --> 37:01.828
Way more than that.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.960
But I didn't have a choice
when she signed me.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.789
I was basically
untouchable for a while.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.922
Long story.[chuckles]

37:08.965 --> 37:10.837
And she gave me

37:10.880 --> 37:15.015
a second chance,
slash, last chance.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.843
And I'm still paying for it.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.323
Mm.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.718
Is Kirby getting
the same kind of raw deal?Probably.

37:22.762 --> 37:26.548
Her career was basically dead
before Charlie came along.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.117
You should warn her
to read the fine print.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.643
I know it's not the best thing
for a new relationship

37:34.687 --> 37:37.255
to bring baggage
in the form of a kid,

37:37.298 --> 37:39.561
certainly not a grown one.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.910
Or three.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.303
But that's how it is,

37:42.347 --> 37:43.783
and I am sorry
for the drama.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.655
So if you're going to dump me,
do it now.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.527
I...But before you do,

37:48.570 --> 37:50.137
I just want to say

37:50.180 --> 37:52.270
thank you for the therapy rec.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.662
Adam and I had a breakthrough.

37:53.706 --> 37:54.968
Okay. That's all.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.839
Go on.

37:56.883 --> 37:59.320
Though Adam and I--
we didn't fix everything,

37:59.364 --> 38:00.930
we-we did make progress.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.454
'Cause healing takes time.

38:02.497 --> 38:05.152
For the love of Sigmund Freud,
stop talking.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.157
I'm not breaking up with you.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.681
Why would I spend the whole day
solving your packaging problem

38:12.725 --> 38:14.117
if I wanted to break up?

38:14.161 --> 38:16.685
Wait, you fixed
my packaging problem?

38:16.729 --> 38:19.122
A VP at an unnamed beauty brand
is an investor in my hedge fund.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.777
I sold her the unused jars and
struck a deal with the supplier

38:21.821 --> 38:23.170
to get the right ones here
in time.

38:23.213 --> 38:24.824
That is amazing.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.347
Thank you.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.350
So instead of a breakup,
I'd now like a makeup.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.352
To be clear, I mean sex,
not beauty products.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.440
[both chuckle]

38:35.530 --> 38:37.358
I wanted to give you this

38:37.402 --> 38:40.361
as a token of my appreciation
for bringing home a win today.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.755
We couldn't have
done it without you.

38:42.798 --> 38:45.061
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

38:45.105 --> 38:48.456
And I'd also like to offer you
the Peachtree Stakes purse

38:48.500 --> 38:49.849
to aid with
your cancer treatments.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.198
Oh, th-that's too generous.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.592
I-I couldn't possibly
accept that.

38:53.635 --> 38:54.680
Yes, you can.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.682
And as I build my stable,

38:56.725 --> 38:58.988
you will be my trainer
from now on.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.077
Or, you know,
for as long as you want.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.645
Well, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to think about it.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.126
I mean, like you,
I prefer to stay in control.

39:06.169 --> 39:09.129
You know, not many people can
get me to do the right thing.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.609
And now it's your turn.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.220
You have to let Sam
know what's going on.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.222
It's not fair to keep him
in the dark.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.272
I need to talk to you.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.491
And I need to talk to you.

39:23.535 --> 39:26.102
Okay, but let me go first. Um...

39:26.146 --> 39:28.496
Okay, but let
me go away.

39:30.193 --> 39:31.456
[sighs]

39:33.588 --> 39:36.417
I'm not a drug addict, Sam.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.897
But I do have cancer.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.203
You saw me
taking medication

39:40.247 --> 39:43.424
for my treatment,
but I-I don't want you to worry.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.817
I'm on the mend, huh?

39:51.780 --> 39:54.087
Kelly, I've given it
some thought,

39:54.130 --> 39:56.785
and as much as
I hate to say it...

39:56.829 --> 40:00.441
I think I want to give you
a second chance.

40:01.964 --> 40:05.054
I know what it's like to be
backed into a corner and panic,

40:05.098 --> 40:09.232
so I'm going against every
instinct and letting you stay.

40:09.276 --> 40:14.063
But, Kelly, if you ever
cross me again,

40:14.107 --> 40:16.414
there will not be
a third chance.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.462
You're giving Kelly
another shot?

40:21.506 --> 40:22.594
Wow.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.247
I'm impressed.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.728
I could have destroyed
her and Patty,

40:26.772 --> 40:30.079
but then I realized
winning isn't everything.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.778
I mean, it's mostly everything,

40:32.821 --> 40:35.520
but sometimes a little trust
goes a long way.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.218
That's very evolved of you.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.438
And now that Allegra has won
her first stakes race,

40:40.481 --> 40:41.830
we can race her
a couple more times

40:41.874 --> 40:43.484
and then start breeding her.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.487
Ooh. Well, as long as
we're discussing breeding,

40:46.531 --> 40:49.621
maybe we should get back
to starting our own bloodline?

40:49.664 --> 40:52.711
Oh, I love it when you
horse-talk to turn me on.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.324
That day we saw Luna,

40:57.367 --> 40:59.326
they hadn't discharged her.

40:59.369 --> 41:02.111
When the doctors told her
she was in renal failure,

41:02.155 --> 41:04.070
she made a break for it.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.682
I'm so sorry, Jeff.

41:07.726 --> 41:08.944
It's unfair.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.164
It is.

41:11.207 --> 41:13.993
And what's even more unfair
is that she couldn't afford

41:14.036 --> 41:17.387
the long-term drugs
needed to keep her alive.

41:17.431 --> 41:20.086
She knew she only had
a handful of days left

41:20.129 --> 41:22.131
and didn't want to spend them
in the hospital.

41:22.175 --> 41:24.220
It's sad,

41:24.264 --> 41:27.006
but be thankful for the time
you got to spend with her.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.791
I wish we had more time.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.012
She left me this.

41:36.319 --> 41:38.104
"Don't miss out on your life

41:38.147 --> 41:41.411
"while you're trying
to get it together.

41:41.455 --> 41:44.197
Take some chances."

41:44.240 --> 41:45.764
Sound advice.

41:47.853 --> 41:50.377
And I'm taking it.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.293
Someone is going to pay
for Luna's death.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.513
I will make sure
she didn't die in vain.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.429
No matter what it takes.

41:59.473 --> 41:59.995
â™ª
