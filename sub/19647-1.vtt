01:00.725 --> 01:02.221
<i>Good morning, Dr. Fletcher.</i>

01:02.321 --> 01:05.791
<i>My name is Dr. Olive Crown
and you need my help.</i>

01:05.891 --> 01:10.212
<i>I am a marine biologist and ecologist
specializing in oceanic trenches.</i>

01:10.312 --> 01:12.514
<i>I am the only non-military personnel...</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:16.052
<i>...to advise on the development
of the 80DS-200 Exosuit.</i>

01:16.152 --> 01:20.889
<i>Working exclusively with the US Navy,
diving off the coast of Southern California.</i>

01:20.989 --> 01:25.398
<i>I had a crucial roll in getting the suit
to perform stably at depths of 1,000 feet...</i>

01:25.498 --> 01:27.526
<i>...but their ambition was limited.</i>

01:27.626 --> 01:30.767
<i>Yours I believe is not and neither is mine.</i>

01:31.267 --> 01:34.523
<i>There were rumors on the confront circuit
that you are developing a new suit...</i>

01:34.623 --> 01:38.775
<i>...one that can go deeper, explore
further. I want to be your diver.</i>

01:38.875 --> 01:41.410
<i>Your paper suggesting that all life stems...</i>

01:41.510 --> 01:45.314
<i>...from one single deoceanic rift
is compelling.</i>

01:45.614 --> 01:48.601
<i>Not many people are able
to make such a bold statement.</i>

01:48.701 --> 01:50.319
<i>And I have one of my own.</i>

01:50.419 --> 01:53.345
<i>I have always felt that I am
destined to make discoveries...</i>

01:53.445 --> 01:56.292
<i>...that will change the course of humanity.</i>

01:56.492 --> 02:01.263
<i>Your expedition, Dr. Fletcher is the first
with ambition that matches my own.</i>

02:01.363 --> 02:05.134
<i>You need someone who will
push themselves to the limit.</i>

02:05.234 --> 02:07.101
<i>You need me.</i>

02:16.945 --> 02:19.682
<i>Whatever it is your searching for down there.</i>

02:19.982 --> 02:21.785
<i>I can find it.</i>

02:37.332 --> 02:39.735
<i>Flowing the descent now.</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:46.391
<i>Activating suit illumination.</i>

02:50.411 --> 02:55.484
Pressure's good. Orientation's good.
Continue the descent.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.786
<i>You're reaching the maximum
tolerance of the suit.</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:02.792
I'm approaching the source
of the seismic reading.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.059
Keep lowering.

03:06.494 --> 03:10.666
- <i>The suit isn't tested on these depths.</i>
- I'm testing it now.

03:10.766 --> 03:13.835
Give me another 200 feet, I'm almost there.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.009
<i>Lowering to 1,500 feet.</i>

03:49.804 --> 03:52.741
Visibility's dire. Give me some more light.

04:03.518 --> 04:05.454
There's something down here.

04:05.554 --> 04:08.790
<i>Olive? I can't hear you.</i>

04:10.992 --> 04:13.462
Dara? Dara, are you there?

04:13.562 --> 04:16.204
<i>Repeat your last transmission.</i>

04:24.206 --> 04:26.040
<i>I can't hear anything.</i>

04:28.843 --> 04:31.716
<i>Pull her up. Get her out of there.</i>

04:43.325 --> 04:46.714
Olive, Olive, Olive, Olive. Breathe, breathe.

04:46.814 --> 04:49.029
Breathe, breathe.

04:53.701 --> 04:55.504
Thought we lost you there.

05:03.311 --> 05:05.546
The Exosuit failed.

05:07.615 --> 05:08.916
How?

05:10.318 --> 05:12.588
We lost contact with you.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.573
But you're back now.

05:14.673 --> 05:17.161
Relax. Breathe.

05:47.522 --> 05:49.457
What happened down there?

05:52.193 --> 05:53.961
I don't remember.

05:54.929 --> 05:59.668
Most likely cerebral hypoxia.
That would explain the memory loss.

05:59.768 --> 06:03.960
You should get it back.
But I wanna see you everyday until we dock.

06:05.090 --> 06:08.093
And for now, make sure you get some rest.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.034
I shouldn't have let you go that deep.

06:16.134 --> 06:18.811
I run the dive. This is on me.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.738
But you could've died.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.525
All part of the job.

06:28.112 --> 06:30.115
You need to listen more.

06:32.343 --> 06:33.751
Dara.

06:38.456 --> 06:40.291
You saved my life.

06:42.410 --> 06:43.878
Thank you.

06:44.429 --> 06:46.464
Just doing my job.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.500
- You're back early.
- Dr. Fletcher.

08:00.137 --> 08:02.206
This the tobe I had?

08:13.050 --> 08:15.486
What the fuck happened down there?

08:16.654 --> 08:20.492
There's millions of pounds of damage.
The whole diving's fucked.

08:20.592 --> 08:23.511
- I was almost killed.
- What happened down there?

08:26.130 --> 08:27.932
I don't remember.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.554
The dive has been postponed indefinitely.

08:31.954 --> 08:35.779
You destroyed my suit.
My research is wasted...

08:35.879 --> 08:38.280
- ...you are fired.
- But, Dr. Fletcher...

08:38.381 --> 08:41.614
I don't want to see your face
till we make port.

08:42.414 --> 08:45.083
You're lucky I don't throw you overboard.

08:50.955 --> 08:54.592
Enjoy your leave. It's going to last awhile.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.573
What's the damage?

11:17.673 --> 11:19.892
- Oxygen tank's burst.
- How?

11:20.002 --> 11:22.571
A blockage.
No way to fix it, I need to replace it.

11:22.671 --> 11:25.745
I know Fletcher fired you. It's not right.

11:25.845 --> 11:27.711
It's done.

11:28.532 --> 11:30.781
You'll be home in five days.

12:13.457 --> 12:17.672
<i>I'd like to remind all crew on Shaw Beak
to submit for a full physical...</i>

12:17.772 --> 12:20.295
<i>...for the ship to Dr. Froid Spark.</i>

12:20.395 --> 12:23.769
<i>And a further announce,
the intra permit to off limits...</i>

12:23.869 --> 12:28.271
<i>...to all personnel after 5 p.m. is complete.</i>

13:19.023 --> 13:21.757
- Here let me.
- You're back then.

13:21.857 --> 13:24.296
- Just docked.
- Have you seen Matthew yet?

13:24.596 --> 13:29.204
You put that down. Stop wasting time
with this old country, go see your fella.

13:29.534 --> 13:31.947
He's been moping around since you left.

13:32.047 --> 13:34.840
- You've been looking out for him, haven't you?
- Of course I have, darling.

13:34.940 --> 13:39.409
Now get inside
and put a smile back on his face.

13:39.810 --> 13:41.879
We'll catch you later.

14:09.423 --> 14:10.644
Hello?

14:13.871 --> 14:15.078
Hi.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.814
Olive.

14:28.859 --> 14:30.832
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

14:30.932 --> 14:32.746
It wasn't planned.

14:34.598 --> 14:37.599
We have three new patients at work.
It's absolutely crazy.

14:37.699 --> 14:41.563
- I can't let 'em down.
- Of course. You should go in.

14:41.663 --> 14:45.206
- But you're here.
- And I'll be here when you get home.

14:47.578 --> 14:50.716
- You're late already.
- It's only a single.

14:50.816 --> 14:54.486
I'll be back for tea.
In fact, I'm gonna cook you dinner.

14:54.586 --> 14:57.570
- Crab rozau, you're gonna love it.
- You're good to me.

15:02.256 --> 15:04.495
I'll be back before you know it.

15:36.493 --> 15:37.961
Matt.

17:04.382 --> 17:06.250
You down here?

17:07.984 --> 17:09.653
Just finishing up.

17:21.295 --> 17:22.750
Wow, you've been busy.

17:22.849 --> 17:25.182
- Good day?
- It is now.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.215
Five months.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.657
I thought about you every day.

18:05.309 --> 18:07.377
I'm no good on my own.

18:08.278 --> 18:11.282
I don't know. House has never looked better.

18:20.357 --> 18:22.161
I won't leave again.

18:22.961 --> 18:25.796
I'm back. For good this time.

18:35.606 --> 18:38.450
- Going to gym.
- I can see.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.146
I did do something all me self.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.112
Maybe I'll...

18:43.613 --> 18:45.415
...make it up to you.

19:14.328 --> 19:16.097
What you up to today, trouble?

19:16.197 --> 19:18.625
I've got something to keep me busy.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.892
I'm glad you're home.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.838
Don't go changing.

19:42.506 --> 19:44.207
I'll be back soon.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.412
You're okay.

22:58.068 --> 23:00.805
- You down here?
- Wait, I'll come up.

23:00.905 --> 23:04.611
You all ready, yeah? Table's booked for six.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.145
I'm coming.

23:14.718 --> 23:16.521
What are you doing back?

23:16.621 --> 23:19.357
I'm tired. We should've finished an hour ago.

23:19.457 --> 23:21.079
You're still in your PJ's?

23:22.699 --> 23:24.662
What have you been up to today? Lazy day?

23:30.734 --> 23:34.172
- You're wearing shadow.
- I'm fine, I'll go get changed.

23:48.017 --> 23:49.486
You alright?

23:51.355 --> 23:53.157
I'm fine.

24:04.167 --> 24:06.237
Fuckin' this idiot.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.055
Come on, mate.

24:57.754 --> 25:00.757
Careful. You'll be sick.

25:26.783 --> 25:28.652
I'm tired.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.532
Okay. Let's try for a better
introduction this time.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.206
A smokescreen.

26:55.306 --> 26:57.374
Trying to hide, are we?

27:03.370 --> 27:05.248
Come on.

27:18.828 --> 27:20.697
What are you?

27:21.798 --> 27:23.768
Where does it come from?

27:23.868 --> 27:25.703
The dive.

27:26.369 --> 27:29.339
- You stole this?
- I found it.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.709
You shouldn't have took it.

27:32.209 --> 27:34.279
I went through a lot in that day.

27:36.579 --> 27:38.382
It was an egg before.

27:39.149 --> 27:42.887
It got lodged in the suit.
I didn't know what it was.

27:42.987 --> 27:44.855
Still don't.

27:46.356 --> 27:49.126
It's a separate part of sorts.

27:49.226 --> 27:53.598
It's old. Really old, almost pre-historic.

27:53.698 --> 27:57.902
We found it so deep,
I'm surprised it survived up here.

28:01.838 --> 28:04.041
Look at that. It does look ill.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.977
What do you mean?

28:06.477 --> 28:09.486
Its coloration's faded, that's not good.

28:12.632 --> 28:14.851
It's a pretty thing.

28:15.719 --> 28:17.287
Stop!

28:24.894 --> 28:28.131
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

28:30.867 --> 28:33.003
Have you seen a doctor since we got back?

28:33.103 --> 28:34.972
I don't need to.

28:36.773 --> 28:40.244
Can you remember a bit
what happened to you down there yet?

28:40.844 --> 28:43.481
No. But I'm fine.

28:43.581 --> 28:47.384
- Have you told Matt?
- He'd only worry.

28:48.752 --> 28:50.577
I'll laugh.

28:50.677 --> 28:54.922
If you wanna help,
tell me if that's a new species.

28:55.792 --> 28:57.595
It won't be new.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.701
The ocean's more ancient than the mountains.

29:04.001 --> 29:06.370
Is it a new find?

29:06.470 --> 29:09.373
I don't know. I can't be sure here.

29:09.473 --> 29:13.694
- You need to bring it to the lab.
- I don't work there anymore.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.464
And Dr. Fletcher cannot find out about this.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.766
Promise me.

29:18.866 --> 29:20.935
You have been under a lot of stress, Olive.

29:21.035 --> 29:23.707
- You need to get some rest.
- Promise me!

29:23.807 --> 29:26.089
This is between us.

29:28.091 --> 29:29.690
I promise.

29:33.329 --> 29:35.165
How was work?

29:35.265 --> 29:39.303
Worse than ever. I could deal
with his crap when we were at sea.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.405
I have the ocean for company.

29:41.505 --> 29:45.142
I'm off to the locals tonight to see
if I can get the wall swaying again.

29:45.242 --> 29:48.813
The grogs better than what
we had on the boat at least.

29:48.913 --> 29:51.982
- You and Matt should come down.
- Maybe.

29:52.515 --> 29:54.720
Is everything alright with you and him?

29:56.570 --> 29:58.654
Five months is a long time.

29:59.989 --> 30:01.826
He's a good guy.

30:02.226 --> 30:04.151
I imagine he's a good listener.

30:05.795 --> 30:08.033
Thanks for coming down, Dara.

30:09.033 --> 30:12.036
That thing, whatever it is...

30:12.136 --> 30:14.004
...you need to find out what it eats.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.113
It's malnourished.

30:17.323 --> 30:19.727
And if you really want to categorize this...

30:20.277 --> 30:22.179
...come by the weekend.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.582
You can have my pass. No one will know.

30:27.383 --> 30:28.952
Thanks.

33:15.718 --> 33:17.922
You've got to eat something.

33:57.050 --> 33:57.876
Ellena.

33:57.976 --> 34:00.965
If you don't want me to borrow his bike
he shouldn't have left the keys in it.

34:01.065 --> 34:02.199
You could've been arrested.

34:02.299 --> 34:04.970
The Cambodia police
aren't as uptight as here.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.735
She's a wild one, your sister.

34:09.306 --> 34:11.107
Your turn.

34:18.649 --> 34:20.817
She's a cheat,
that's the second time you've had me.

34:20.917 --> 34:23.654
Skilled. See?

34:23.754 --> 34:25.321
Now.

34:27.847 --> 34:31.529
- Oh, no. No, no.
- Oh, yes. I think so.

34:31.978 --> 34:33.737
It's a gift.

34:34.263 --> 34:36.746
A gift, don't be impolite.

34:37.763 --> 34:39.636
You are a bad influence.

34:39.735 --> 34:43.139
No, she's good for you.
If I smell like a press.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.107
What's this?

34:47.342 --> 34:49.279
You've trained him well.

34:49.379 --> 34:52.396
- You gonna marry him then?
- We're not like that.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.619
Ellie.

34:58.654 --> 35:01.425
Still. He's hot though.

35:01.525 --> 35:03.961
Mamma always said you had a good eye.

35:04.261 --> 35:06.195
I miss her.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.299
Me too.

35:13.672 --> 35:16.507
Matty! Hurry up!

35:16.607 --> 35:19.475
My sister needs a drink.

35:41.174 --> 35:43.217
Can you hear that?

36:44.628 --> 36:47.164
- Are you okay?
- I'm bleeding.

36:47.264 --> 36:49.144
Yeah, let me help.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.201
Here, let me.

37:22.265 --> 37:25.235
- Hello?
- <i>What have you got in your basement?</i>

37:25.335 --> 37:28.472
- Fletcher.
- <i>You took something from my dive.</i>

37:28.572 --> 37:32.909
<i>That research belongs to me,
you are in serious shit, little girl.</i>

37:33.009 --> 37:35.713
Dr. Fletcher, I don't what you think
you've heard but I don't have...

37:35.813 --> 37:40.066
<i>Don't lie to me, Olive.
Dara told me everything, you are a thief.</i>

37:40.166 --> 37:42.986
- Dara?
- <i>You have a new species.</i>

37:43.086 --> 37:46.409
<i>You bring that creature to me right now
or I'll come banging at your door...</i>

37:46.509 --> 37:48.942
<i>...with the police
and a team full of lawyers.</i>

37:49.092 --> 37:51.506
<i>You'll never dive again, you little thief.</i>

37:52.462 --> 37:54.497
<i>You have one hour.</i>

38:02.004 --> 38:03.841
Everything alright?

38:04.141 --> 38:06.276
I need to go into work.

38:06.376 --> 38:08.512
Today? But we're all going out.

38:08.612 --> 38:10.881
Well, somebody has to pay the bills.

38:10.981 --> 38:12.416
Calm down.

38:12.516 --> 38:14.751
And what are your plans for today?
More slacking off?

38:14.851 --> 38:17.354
- After you've eaten more of my food.
- Olive.

38:17.454 --> 38:21.525
For your information,
I was gonna take you out. To say thanks.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.693
But you can stuff it.

38:26.212 --> 38:29.415
What's wrong with you? Ellie, wait.

39:58.821 --> 40:02.459
What's the matter?
This is as fresh as I can get.

40:07.763 --> 40:09.232
Fletcher.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.675
Is that the spawn?
That creature belongs to me.

40:13.775 --> 40:15.712
Get away from there.

40:32.370 --> 40:33.957
You're hurting it.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.895
It was you who showed me.

40:38.195 --> 40:40.062
It's mine!

41:02.818 --> 41:05.289
You don't even know what you have.

41:13.996 --> 41:15.866
You're wrong, Fletcher.

41:20.469 --> 41:22.569
I have a way to feed it.

48:48.316 --> 48:50.320
She owes me an apology.

48:50.420 --> 48:52.222
Leave out of it, Ellie.

49:01.197 --> 49:03.031
Come on.

49:03.465 --> 49:05.501
It was just a joke.

49:05.601 --> 49:07.402
Lighten up.

49:10.272 --> 49:12.542
She needs to bring it down a peg or two.

49:13.342 --> 49:15.278
What does she even do all day?

49:15.378 --> 49:17.814
She thinks she's so important.

49:19.781 --> 49:21.650
I don't know.

49:21.950 --> 49:24.421
You don't know a lot about your girlfriend?

49:25.671 --> 49:27.399
Too bad.

49:34.396 --> 49:36.266
And where are you going?

49:36.766 --> 49:38.801
I'm gonna find out what's down there.

49:38.901 --> 49:40.904
You can't, it's her work.

50:43.982 --> 50:46.225
Hey! What are you doing down here?

50:46.325 --> 50:50.106
- Getting your attention.
- You can't be down here.

50:50.739 --> 50:54.844
- Hey, you're hurting me.
- You can't be down here.

50:54.944 --> 50:57.013
What's wrong with you?

50:57.113 --> 50:59.515
I came to help you.

50:59.615 --> 51:02.869
You've lost a lot,
even Matt thinks you're crazy.

51:03.619 --> 51:07.089
- Matt said that?
- As good as.

51:07.689 --> 51:09.625
What's happened to you?

51:09.725 --> 51:11.949
And what are you doing down here?

51:13.029 --> 51:16.283
It's called work, sis.
Maybe you should try it sometime.

51:17.533 --> 51:21.339
You're not as special
as what you think you are, Olive.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.921
It's okay.

51:39.187 --> 51:41.391
No one's going to hurt you again.

52:05.480 --> 52:09.285
I like your sister,
but... it's nice just the two of us.

52:12.187 --> 52:14.458
Don't feel like I've seen you in ages.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.380
My work's important.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.764
I know.

52:22.997 --> 52:24.866
I know.

52:28.703 --> 52:31.040
Ellie didn't break anything, did she?

52:31.140 --> 52:33.376
She's a wild one your sister.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.578
Uncontrollable.

52:41.016 --> 52:43.698
You know, my work's
pretty busy at the moment.

52:45.188 --> 52:47.490
Yeah, there's this little old lady.

52:47.590 --> 52:49.157
Ms. Jones.

52:49.257 --> 52:52.596
She's almost 90
but she doesn't have long left.

52:53.196 --> 52:55.199
We're monitoring around the clock.

52:56.899 --> 52:58.453
She's a mute.

53:01.736 --> 53:03.806
Can't communicate her off.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.644
Can't make a sound.

53:08.844 --> 53:10.712
It's sad.

53:11.113 --> 53:12.981
Very sad.

53:16.118 --> 53:19.824
<i>Local experts inform the council
yet again about the severe weather...</i>

53:19.924 --> 53:22.691
<i>...set to hit the coast in the next few days.</i>

53:22.791 --> 53:27.373
<i>Residents and flood risk areas are advised
to ensure to take necessary precautions...</i>

53:27.473 --> 53:29.499
<i>...in the events of flooding.</i>

54:00.262 --> 54:02.131
What are you doing?

54:03.131 --> 54:06.535
I didn't expect this. You here for lunch?

54:07.686 --> 54:09.298
You left your ID.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.277
You came all this way for that?

54:14.377 --> 54:16.445
Thought you'd need it.

54:19.281 --> 54:22.350
No, I... I do, thanks.

54:23.518 --> 54:26.155
- Do you wanna come for lunch?
- I can't.

57:48.056 --> 57:52.027
You know what Dr. Fletcher was like, Oliver,
he just keeps on pushing and pushing.

57:52.127 --> 57:55.698
He just constantly
and he wouldn't let up but...

57:55.798 --> 57:58.334
...I didn't mean to let anything out.

57:58.434 --> 58:01.636
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

58:04.038 --> 58:06.710
I haven't seen Fletcher since I told him.

58:11.145 --> 58:13.750
Did you know there was a fire on the boat?

58:16.975 --> 58:19.410
I'll do anything I can to help.

58:25.460 --> 58:29.131
- It's pretty dark in here, Olive.
- Over here.

58:46.581 --> 58:50.218
- Children grow up so fast.
- Oh, my God.

58:51.352 --> 58:54.639
Fletcher was wrong
to try and take it from me.

58:55.921 --> 58:59.534
You should never separate
a mother from her child.

59:49.510 --> 59:52.943
- You okay?
- This fucking wine.

59:54.082 --> 59:55.951
What's wrong?

59:58.786 --> 01:00:01.023
A patient went missing today.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:03.426
I'm really worried about her.

01:00:03.726 --> 01:00:05.260
Shit.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.030
Management is starting to point fingers.

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.247
They say it's my fault. I could lose my job.

01:00:11.347 --> 01:00:13.603
I'm sure everything will be fine.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.407
Here. Have a beer instead.

01:00:25.613 --> 01:00:27.483
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:33.406
- What? Why?
- I'm a traveler. Gotta keep rolling.

01:00:33.506 --> 01:00:35.771
I'll be working tomorrow.

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.729
Then I guess this is goodbye.

01:00:42.063 --> 01:00:43.933
We should have a drink.

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:48.103
- I don't feel like it.
- Oh, come on, don't be like that.

01:00:48.203 --> 01:00:51.040
Forget about the red. We got white.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.209
I could open the white.

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.665
Let's have a drink, it'll be a laugh.

01:00:56.745 --> 01:00:58.280
Okay.

01:01:56.404 --> 01:01:58.240
They fired me.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.352
What is it?

01:02:16.124 --> 01:02:18.072
Let me see.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.943
I can't believe it.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.049
I can't believe it.

01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:42.130
I have to tell them.

01:02:43.384 --> 01:02:46.438
Matt! Ellie, Matt!

01:03:03.554 --> 01:03:05.090
Olive.

01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:08.877
You bitch.

01:03:17.952 --> 01:03:19.821
Let me go.

01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:23.824
You're crazy, let me go!

01:03:27.195 --> 01:03:30.632
You're my sister. My own flesh and blood.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:35.250
What are you doing?

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:42.320
Let me go. Matt needs help!

01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:45.747
He needs nothing.

01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:51.486
Olive!

01:03:51.753 --> 01:03:54.823
Let me out of here, you crazy bitch.

01:03:54.923 --> 01:03:56.491
Olive!

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:56.344
Come on!

01:06:05.153 --> 01:06:06.755
Olive.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.708
Olive.

01:07:08.119 --> 01:07:09.584
Olive!

01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:25.266
Where is she?

01:07:34.475 --> 01:07:36.043
No.

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:44.552
You attacked me.

01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:49.791
How could you do that?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.109
To me.

01:07:53.127 --> 01:07:54.962
You love her.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.516
Ellena?

01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:17.218
Matt!

01:08:25.026 --> 01:08:26.594
Matt.

01:08:28.362 --> 01:08:29.863
Matt.

01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:31.599
No!

01:09:40.868 --> 01:09:42.303
Come on.

01:10:47.968 --> 01:10:49.237
Olive!

01:10:51.438 --> 01:10:53.308
Be quiet.

01:10:53.408 --> 01:10:56.845
- She needs rest.
- What the fuck is that?

01:10:57.645 --> 01:11:00.882
She's a god. A god I command.

01:11:02.316 --> 01:11:04.961
She won't hurt you unless I want her to.

01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:07.823
At first I was overwhelmed.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.026
It's a merciful thing.

01:11:11.126 --> 01:11:14.962
The inability of the human mind
to correlate all its contents.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.899
But now I understand.

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:23.411
They have slumbered for ions down there.

01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:27.508
In the dark below. Waiting to be awoken.

01:11:28.342 --> 01:11:30.134
They chose me.

01:11:32.646 --> 01:11:35.690
You've gone fucking mental.

01:11:39.019 --> 01:11:40.578
How dare you.

01:11:42.389 --> 01:11:44.526
I was going to share this with you.

01:11:44.626 --> 01:11:46.644
You're a murderer.

01:11:49.963 --> 01:11:52.434
I did what was deemed to be done.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:55.502
You killed Matt.

01:11:58.872 --> 01:12:00.712
A necessary sacrifice.

01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:04.320
He would not have survived what is to come.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.281
Let me show you.

01:12:10.017 --> 01:12:11.819
Olive, don't.

01:12:14.888 --> 01:12:16.758
It'll kill you.

01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:19.862
What are you doing in there?

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:28.402
What is that?

01:12:29.203 --> 01:12:31.005
Our future.

01:12:31.171 --> 01:12:33.240
Your future.

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.981
We live on a placid island of ignorance.

01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:42.732
In the mists of black seas of infinity.

01:12:43.285 --> 01:12:46.317
And it was not meant
that we should voyage far.

01:12:48.822 --> 01:12:51.558
But I have seen beyond...

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:53.905
...the bounds of infinity.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:57.502
And drawn down demons from the start.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.910
I have harnessed the shadows...

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:06.340
...that stride from world to world.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.113
To sew death and madness.

01:13:15.582 --> 01:13:19.188
Olive. You need to put that back.

01:13:19.888 --> 01:13:21.936
She won't ever hurt me.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.126
Is everyone okay?

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.534
- I can hear an awful noise.
- Get me out of here!

01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:39.890
Hang on, darling. I can't see a bloody thing.

01:15:36.623 --> 01:15:40.159
Ms. Crown, I'm sorry, but we've checked
the basement and the perimeter...

01:15:40.259 --> 01:15:44.066
...and there's no trace
of this animal you described missing.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:49.393
Put in a call for the station we're gonna
need a trauma counselor or something now.

01:15:50.971 --> 01:15:54.542
<i>We've got a broken drainage break downstairs.</i>

01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:57.011
<i>Think the suspect
could've escaped down there.</i>

01:15:57.111 --> 01:15:59.647
<i>We notified dispatch,
get some searches out...</i>

01:15:59.747 --> 01:16:02.784
<i>...maybe have a look in the sewer
system and see what's going on.</i>

01:17:29.369 --> 01:17:32.019
<i>As water levels continue
to rise and more families...</i>

01:17:32.119 --> 01:17:36.168
<i>...are forced to evacuate flood risk areas,
government officials are coming under fire...</i>

01:17:36.268 --> 01:17:38.770
<i>...for slow response times
in the current crisis.</i>

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:42.517
<i>Over 600 homes in the north of England
have suffered severe flooding.</i>

01:17:42.617 --> 01:17:46.161
<i>And what experts are calling
the biggest rain fall of the last 10 years.</i>

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.947
<i>Flood defenses across the region
failed to provide adequate protection...</i>

01:17:55.047 --> 01:17:58.810
<i>...against the rising waters with key roads
cutting off emergency services.</i>

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:02.964
<i>One local government deny reports that
a lack of appropriate flood defenses...</i>

01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:06.374
<i>...has diverted the majority of flood water
into the sewage system...</i>

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:09.914
<i>...contaminating hundreds of miles
of the nearby coastal region.</i>

01:18:10.014 --> 01:18:12.764
<i>Environmental groups are citing
the contamination as the reason...</i>

01:18:12.864 --> 01:18:15.416
<i>...behind the dwindling
marine life in the region.</i>

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:18.403
<i>With the local fishing industry
in an understandable uproar.</i>

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:21.601
<i>This past week, thousands
of dead fish and other marine life...</i>

01:18:21.701 --> 01:18:23.444
<i>...have washed up on nearby beaches.</i>

01:18:23.544 --> 01:18:27.161
<i>Including some species never
before seen in the open waters.</i>

01:18:27.261 --> 01:18:31.616
<i>Several beaches along the coastline
have already been declared at fault...</i>

01:19:45.205 --> 01:19:47.208
Mommy, what's that?

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.651
There's more over there.
