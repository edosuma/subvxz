WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:09.593
[protesters chanting] Not my president!
Not my president!

00:09.676 --> 00:12.513
-Not my president!
-[all] Not my president!

00:12.596 --> 00:15.557
-Not my president!
-[all] Not my president!

00:15.641 --> 00:16.934
[chanting continues]

00:22.355 --> 00:23.941
The people are angry.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.652
Nine weeks ago,
we had an election in this country,

00:26.735 --> 00:29.446
but because two states refused to certify,

00:29.530 --> 00:33.742
neither Conway nor myself
received the 270 electoral votes

00:33.826 --> 00:35.410
required for victory.

00:35.493 --> 00:40.290
So they gather here every morning
to exercise their magnificent right,

00:40.373 --> 00:42.793
guaranteed by the First Amendment...

00:43.752 --> 00:46.880
to let their angry voices be heard.

00:48.966 --> 00:54.179
And so, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and half of January have come and gone,

00:54.262 --> 00:57.307
and all three branches of government
are in crisis.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.101
The Congress is in disarray,

00:59.184 --> 01:02.020
the Supreme Court is down a justice
and doomed to deadlock,

01:02.104 --> 01:05.190
and the executive branch
is without a boss.

01:06.316 --> 01:10.528
You see, my feeling is, I think
the Founding Fathers, they just got tired.

01:10.613 --> 01:13.824
And really, can you blame them?
I mean, you can't think of everything.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.701
Black swans, Murphy's Law.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.452
I mean, at a certain point,
you just have to sign off

01:17.535 --> 01:21.081
and cross your goddamn fingers
and hope for the best.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.917
Or adopt "flipism,"

01:24.001 --> 01:27.004
a pseudo-philosophy of life
in which the most important decisions

01:27.087 --> 01:29.715
are made by the flipping of a coin.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.550
It was first introduced
in the Disney comic book

01:32.635 --> 01:34.427
<i>Flip Decision,</i> one of my favorites,

01:34.511 --> 01:37.597
in which Donald Duck
is persuaded by Professor Batty

01:37.681 --> 01:41.601
to make all the most important decisions
based on the flipping of a coin.

01:41.685 --> 01:45.981
"Life is but a gamble.
Let flipism guide your ramble."

01:48.316 --> 01:50.318
We've had this sort of trouble before.

01:50.402 --> 01:53.697
The election of 1800,
Jefferson versus Burr.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.533
They wound up in a tie.
73 electoral votes each.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.828
That was the number required then,
and that's when Congress

01:59.912 --> 02:03.749
tried to address what the Founding Fathers
just couldn't imagine.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.044
And, poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.881
And it says
that if the states don't certify,

02:10.964 --> 02:13.175
it's the House that chooses the president

02:13.258 --> 02:15.427
and the Senate that chooses
the vice president.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.762
Now the House is a bit of a mess,

02:16.845 --> 02:19.640
but the Senate is rather democratic
in how they choose the VP.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.558
One person, one vote.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.436
But if there's a tie...

02:24.519 --> 02:28.523
and this is where Donald Duck comes in,
it's resolved...

02:28.606 --> 02:30.025
by the toss of a coin.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.653
A solution that's elegant as hell.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.114
But then there's no elegance
in modern politics. It's mostly hell.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.412
The identity of the next President
of these United States

02:42.495 --> 02:45.498
is once again in the hands
of a bunch of self-serving,

02:45.582 --> 02:49.127
money-hungry, boot-licking,
power-seeking politicians

02:49.211 --> 02:53.548
who can be seduced or sucker punched
or blackmailed into submission.

02:54.717 --> 02:57.803
And all I need is just one more vote
than the other guy.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.809
As you can see,
the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.104
But I did.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.821
Meet your new daddy.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.412
[theme music playing]

03:25.000 --> 03:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:07.390 --> 05:08.433
Right.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.603
You can feel it, right?
It's like you're there.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.524
Doesn't that look just like it?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.069
To me, it is that place.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.956
-You okay, man?
-[breathes heavily]

05:31.039 --> 05:33.416
Huh? Yeah. Of course.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.211
[Tony] It really helps. Very effective.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.464
Yeah. [stammers] I'd be happy to help you
find more funding for it.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.635
If you're feeling a little worked up...

05:43.718 --> 05:44.761
What?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.390
Little worked up?

05:49.224 --> 05:52.936
I was elected President
of the United States over two months ago.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.522
But somehow,
Congress is now deciding the election.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
So forgive me for being a little...

05:57.565 --> 05:58.733
-Will...
-...worked up.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.861
I don't think Tony was implying anything.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.739
Of course. Good.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.867
I'm gonna get myself ready.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.702
I don't want to go to the event
looking like this.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.204
Right. [chuckles]

06:12.539 --> 06:13.999
[Hannah] Thanks, Tony.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.841
[Doug] Romero's chief of staff
insists he's not in town.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.718
-And do you believe her?
-No.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.055
But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.639
At some point she'll take care of herself.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.474
Well, did you tell her
I have no interest in discussing

06:31.558 --> 06:33.643
the Declaration of War Committee with him?

06:33.726 --> 06:36.939
I expressed our desire for a civil and
productive meeting with the Congressman.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.942
Well, find him. If he wants to hide
from me, he can do it to my face.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.443
Yes, sir.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.278
Oh, and, Doug. [sighs]

06:45.989 --> 06:48.075
How many protestors are out there today?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.577
More than yesterday.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.413
But they're doing their best to divert
them away from the White House.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.583
I don't know what's worse...

06:56.666 --> 07:01.046
the sound of their chanting
or the sound of silence when they're not.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.342
I'll get to work, sir.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.827
Good morning, Augustus.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.039
Well, Eric, I... [stammers]

07:36.957 --> 07:39.001
I'm sorry.
[stutters] They told me to sit, but, uh--

07:39.084 --> 07:41.586
Oh, no, no, no. It's perfectly fine. I...

07:41.669 --> 07:43.964
I can't imagine anyone else who would...

07:45.173 --> 07:48.677
well, enjoy this more than you.

07:48.760 --> 07:54.182
You know, I only started it
after you and I met in Spotsylvania.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.310
The attention to detail is... It's just...

07:57.394 --> 07:58.645
It is, yes.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.733
[stammers] I've got...

08:04.734 --> 08:05.902
I mean, I...

08:07.654 --> 08:12.325
[sighs] I'm sorry, I'm a...
a little overwhelmed by the moment.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.910
[stammering] It's just...

08:14.577 --> 08:17.706
I have this feeling, as if, uh...

08:17.789 --> 08:20.375
I've imagined this somehow.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.586
I know that sounds, uh...

08:25.630 --> 08:27.174
[sighs and chuckles]

08:27.257 --> 08:30.343
Uh, you've even got the button
on his haversack.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.511
Yes.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.390
I think people underestimate...

08:37.225 --> 08:39.977
the importance of detail...

08:40.895 --> 08:42.980
to the overall impact.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.361
[chuckles] Yeah.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.240
The Bloody Angle experts
would be very impressed.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.329
[stammers] When we met in Spotsylvania,
how did you know...

08:58.246 --> 09:02.167
so many specific things
about Augustus, uh...

09:02.292 --> 09:06.003
about Augustus Underwood's death?
I mean, the very spot where he died?

09:06.088 --> 09:08.881
The... the fact that his skull
had been crushed with a rock?

09:08.965 --> 09:12.427
That they buried him in an unmarked grave?
I mean...

09:13.136 --> 09:15.263
the detail of all that.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.600
Hope you'll forgive me, uh...

09:19.517 --> 09:20.518
For?

09:21.603 --> 09:24.772
I was meeting
Vice President Francis Underwood.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.151
I... thought he deserved a good story.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.825
[stammers] Oh...
Wait, wait a minute. You...

09:38.203 --> 09:40.580
-you made all that up?
-Well...

09:41.706 --> 09:44.459
-I took some liberties.
-[Frank laughing]

09:48.004 --> 09:51.341
But, well, I don't know, once it started,
it came to me so clearly...

09:51.424 --> 09:52.759
[laughing]

09:57.722 --> 09:59.682
-It's Eric, yeah?
-Yes, sir.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.897
[sighs]

10:08.816 --> 10:10.152
[Eric] The crowd?

10:13.321 --> 10:16.824
Yes. I'm sorry,
what were you about to say?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.455
I don't mean to overstep, sir...

10:23.248 --> 10:26.042
but the people out there...

10:26.126 --> 10:27.794
I don't care what they're saying.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.756
And the way I see it,
a person's destiny is, you know...

10:32.965 --> 10:34.050
sealed.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.178
We are in uncharted territory here.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.597
All right. But, Donny,
do me a favor, okay?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.182
-Let the Constitution--
-[stutters] Can I finish?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.685
Hold on.
Just let the Constitution do its job.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.103
Okay, Joe, Joe, I'm gonna finish for once.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.897
You've got voters
filing individual suits...

10:47.981 --> 10:49.649
-[Joe] Right. That's fine.
-...in Tennessee and Ohio,

10:49.732 --> 10:51.192
and they are jammed up
in the Supreme Court.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.612
Like everything else, the day-to-day
workings of this country are on hold.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.490
Okay, they may be on hold, but guess what?
Last time I checked,

10:57.574 --> 11:00.243
everybody was still getting
their Social Security checks.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.996
-Yeah, but if the debt limit is reached?
-Oh, come on. Let me finish now.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.498
Again, it's why we have a Constitution.

11:05.582 --> 11:10.044
I know it looks messy. Democracy's messy.
But guess what?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.505
[chuckling] There is a method
to that madness.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.757
I don't know, Joe.
It's more madness than method right now.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.259
I mean, if the government does shut down,

11:16.342 --> 11:18.469
those Social Security checks,
they might not go out.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.015
If the government shuts down, who knows
if Congress can even pick a president?

11:22.098 --> 11:24.184
Each state in the House
just gets one vote.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.978
So if smaller states
like Delaware and Rhode Island

11:27.061 --> 11:28.521
can't reach a consensus...

11:28.605 --> 11:30.732
-Right.
-No, it's true. I mean, if one or two

11:30.815 --> 11:32.942
of these really stubborn
members of Congress

11:33.026 --> 11:34.694
decides they're going to hold this up,
it could be months.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.780
Look, that's what I'm saying.
The road to 26 votes is not an easy one.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.950
All right. Strange days indeed, Mika.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.291
So are these the start to short stories?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.252
Mmm-hmm.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.713
They're nothing yet. Fragments.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.173
Pieces.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.928
I mean, clearly, this is about me.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.139
-Mmm-hmm.
-Uh, this is my mother.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.100
-Mmm-hmm.
-And this is us.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.604
-You can't write--
-I'm writing.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.149
It's what I do. I'm a writer.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.902
-I know you're frustrated, Tom, but--
-I wouldn't say frustrated.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.487
Well, it's invasive.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.700
-Write about your own experiences.
-This is my experience.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.118
Listen, Tom,

12:24.201 --> 12:26.621
just because we've decided
Francis and I need to stay here,

12:26.704 --> 12:27.705
doesn't mean you have to.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.375
So if you have things you need to do,
you should go ahead and do them.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.545
I'll be spending my day
convincing the Senate to vote for me,

12:33.628 --> 12:35.380
so there's no speeches necessary.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.090
Yeah, okay.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.427
You know what?
I do have some things to do.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.845
Some people I need to check in with. So...

12:42.929 --> 12:44.389
Tom.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.016
-Yeah?
-[knocking on door]

12:47.099 --> 12:48.184
Yes?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.812
-[door opens]
-You ready, Mrs. Underwood?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.403
I'll have a car waiting for you.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.579
[door closes]

13:07.662 --> 13:10.290
So do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

13:10.373 --> 13:11.708
Always the bad.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.002
The president's approvals are down to 19%.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.505
And the good?

13:17.589 --> 13:20.425
They're worse for Congress.
And you're at 30.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.722
Well, thankfully it's Congress
we have to convince now, not the public.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.266
These are the remaining senators
we'll target before the vote.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.518
All women, by the way.

13:30.602 --> 13:34.897
The biggest challenges will be
Indiana's freshman senator Susan Newman.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.858
Mmm. The constitutional lawyer?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.901
Uh-huh. And Hawaii's Kerry Kuilima,

13:38.985 --> 13:42.154
who seems to be enjoying
getting to wield a little power for once.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.369
I need to tell you,
there is a lot of pushback on the Hill

13:47.452 --> 13:49.912
about the simultaneous vote
for president and VP.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.707
The country is terrified it'll lead
to a split ticket.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.876
There's threats of a filibuster.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.421
Well, the Dems won the Senate,
and they want to vote when the House does.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.922
That decision's been made.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.594
And the vice president
won't allow a filibuster of any kind

14:04.677 --> 14:06.388
onto the floor.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.056
Ma'am, have you contemplated
how it could possibly work,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.142
you as vice president to President Conway?

14:12.435 --> 14:13.853
That's not going to happen.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.733
[softly] Of course.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.699
I did learn one true thing
about Augustus Underwood.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.075
[Frank] What?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.621
He was dead. Cold.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.208
They put him on a cart...
bunch of dead bodies to bury.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.546
Then, after a full day and night...

14:41.839 --> 14:43.132
he woke up.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.635
What?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.972
Someone stole his shoes
and the buttons off his uniform, but...

14:51.265 --> 14:52.559
he lived.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.937
Few days later,
he caught up to his regiment.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.066
Really?

15:07.364 --> 15:10.827
[sighs] I have to get back to the madness.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.329
I hope I get to see you again,
Mr. President.

15:23.506 --> 15:29.095
Eric... [stammers] what do you do
when you're not, uh... reenacting?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.847
I'm an actor. [chuckles]

15:30.930 --> 15:33.265
Uh, sometimes. I mean,
I'd do a lot more if someone would let me.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.394
So, right now,
I'm mostly a personal trainer.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.731
-A personal trainer?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.066
[smacks lips]

15:42.984 --> 15:46.821
You know where to find me.
[stammers] Uh, and, sir...

15:48.322 --> 15:50.825
no matter how dire things look...

15:51.909 --> 15:53.786
you're gonna come out of this alive.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.665
You're an Underwood, after all.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.793
[chuckles softly]

16:06.215 --> 16:08.968
No, don't...
don't "chief-of-staff" me, Eleanor.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.554
No, don't give me his schedule.
I don't want to hear

16:11.638 --> 16:14.348
about how Congressman Romero
is meeting with his constituents

16:14.432 --> 16:16.559
-or stuck on an Acela train.
-[knocks]

16:18.102 --> 16:19.103
[cell phone vibrates]

16:19.186 --> 16:22.774
You know, it's Fazio, right?
The pronunciation?

16:22.857 --> 16:24.609
Eleanor Fazio?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.319
I... I just want to be sure.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.863
Because when the president wins,
and he is going to win,

16:28.946 --> 16:30.532
I will remember your name.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.911
I still need you to review this release.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.830
Now, obviously, the goal is to combat
the "hiding out" narrative,

16:37.914 --> 16:39.749
emphasizing the work that they're doing.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.668
[cell phone chimes]

16:41.751 --> 16:45.630
-Is it a personal matter?
-Business. It's always business.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.381
I'll e-mail you my sign off.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.927
Wait a second. I need an update
on their schedule for tomorrow.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.763
-We're almost there.
-I want to know how you found out.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.390
If he needs help, that can happen
after he makes it to the White House.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.934
Mark, you're not answering my question.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.853
If word of treatment,
any kind of treatment, got out--

17:00.937 --> 17:02.980
[sighs] His friend was showing him
the therapy. That's it.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.693
-Please don't insult me.
-Who do you think you are?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.236
Inserting yourself
into every aspect of our lives.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.698
Your husband's campaign needed help.
Help arrived.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.032
-Yes, but--
-Help that you, most of all, pushed for.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.785
-[sighs]
-Yes?

17:15.867 --> 17:18.329
-Who told you about the VR therapy?
-He did.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.247
[footsteps approaching]

17:20.330 --> 17:21.749
[Conway] Let's go.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.041
What's going on?

17:24.669 --> 17:27.797
I was just telling Mark
how much I miss having Marshall around.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.965
Well, he's still around.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.011
[cell phone vibrating]

17:36.347 --> 17:37.765
Where are you going?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.183
I forgot my bag.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.768
It's right here.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.396
[Mark] Hello. Yeah.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.190
Yes, sir, he's right here.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.902
-It's him.
-Ah.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.698
Congressman.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.449
[Conway chuckles]

17:55.532 --> 17:58.244
-You have no idea how bad this could get.
-We don't wanna be late.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.329
[Conway] Well, I couldn't agree more.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.750
[Conway chuckles]

18:08.045 --> 18:09.797
She might have gone to Santa Fe.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.929
You don't believe me, do you?

18:18.305 --> 18:20.933
I would need to see something, Lisa.
Something concrete.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.728
I have a photo. I have one, but...

18:26.313 --> 18:27.439
Listen.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.317
Look at me.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.113
You're not the first person
to come here making false claims

18:34.196 --> 18:36.240
-about Underwood and his cronies.
-But I'm telling the truth.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.200
Everything you're saying
you could've read in the paper.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.745
That's how I realized who he was.
His picture in the paper.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.081
Which makes your story harder to prove.
We're talking in circles.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.500
What about Doug Stamper driving me home
when my car broke down,

18:46.583 --> 18:49.461
telling me his name was Peter
and that he sold insurance?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.505
-No one can corroborate that story.
-Rachel!

18:53.049 --> 18:54.300
Rachel could.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.308
-You should finish that.
-I'm not hungry.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.060
Maybe I am. I don't know.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.855
I want to thank you for reaching out.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.448
I am not saying I don't believe you.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.285
But there's already enough evidence
out there to take the president down.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.913
And now, with this election,
he'll be accountable for even more.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.082
-I'm certain of it.
-I don't care.

19:27.374 --> 19:31.378
I don't care about Underwood.
I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.630
I want you to find out
what happened to my...

19:34.841 --> 19:36.968
Whatever, forget it.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.428
-Uh. Hold on.
-Thanks for the sandwich.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.263
[indistinct chatter]

19:42.765 --> 19:44.308
All right. Hold on.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.989
[Romero] There's a story
that I love about LBJ.

19:58.072 --> 20:01.242
Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.954
A congressman was ducking him...
and he came back to his office

20:05.037 --> 20:07.874
to find the president
sitting in his chair...

20:07.957 --> 20:09.083
waiting for him.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.546
The president expects to see you
within the hour.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.135
Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.765
-He was wearing his cowboy hat.
-What?

20:25.516 --> 20:28.978
President Johnson.
You left out the best part of the story.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.479
[cell phone chimes]

20:50.416 --> 20:53.044
We closed the place down last night.
Thanks for the invite.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.047
Bunch of us are headed back to
the same spot tonight, if you wanna come.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.716
Cool. Uh, he has a late lunch today.
Won't be back till 4:00.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.761
-Oh, I just needed to drop this for him.
-Sure.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.764
Next time, just ask.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.891
[Sean] See you tonight.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.153
[sighs] You gambled and you lost.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.698
Actually, my bloc gained seats
more than eight weeks ago.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.202
-Which I suspect is why I'm here.
-Don't overestimate your position.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.120
Or underestimate mine.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.872
You still haven't been
elected president, sir.

21:29.956 --> 21:34.626
Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once
the party turns its back on you, will it?

21:34.710 --> 21:39.173
When Bob Birch puts all the rest
of your sheep in line,

21:39.256 --> 21:42.009
you'll be begging
to come in from the cold.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.929
And two years from now,
you'll be back in Phoenix

21:45.012 --> 21:48.474
replaying this very moment
over and over again in your mind

21:48.557 --> 21:51.352
and realizing
it was the beginning of the end.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.813
Patricia Whittaker
and the Democratic Party

21:53.896 --> 21:55.522
will wipe their hands of you.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.649
-I'm loyal to the party.
-As you should be.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.318
As you should say.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.695
But really...

22:03.155 --> 22:04.866
what's your leverage?

22:06.283 --> 22:10.287
The committee? That's done.
You see, you've already put out, Alex,

22:10.371 --> 22:12.623
and Will Conway
is not taking you to the prom.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.252
My conversations with the governor and
any position that I may or may not have--

22:16.335 --> 22:18.587
Oh, listen to yourself.
Do you even believe you?

22:18.670 --> 22:21.841
You are awfully confident for someone
who's already lost the election once.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.259
[chuckles]

22:24.593 --> 22:27.013
Do me a favor.
Forget the presidency for just a moment.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.472
You don't have...

22:29.681 --> 22:35.062
the capital to build on the congressional
revolution that you've started,

22:35.146 --> 22:37.439
-politically or otherwise.
-Our movement wants to explode things--

22:37.523 --> 22:40.859
Oh, please.
Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.488
You want what they all want.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.118
Access. A better seat at the table.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.870
Your name before the rest.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.959
And that is something that I can give you.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.961
And how many votes
do you want in exchange?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.672
Just three from your ever-growing bloc

23:01.755 --> 23:04.758
would assure me the win
in key delegations.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.427
Specifically?

23:06.510 --> 23:09.638
Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire
are still in play.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.183
All three?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.232
I believe in you, Congressman.
Do you wanna know why?

23:20.316 --> 23:21.317
Tell me.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.487
-Because I trust ambition.
-[chuckles]

23:26.697 --> 23:30.367
-So this is a straight-up bribe.
-Oh, no, Congressman.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.995
A bribe is something you can refuse.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.668
Now, since you haven't been around
the block as many times as I have,

23:39.751 --> 23:41.170
let me walk you through how this works.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.839
Excuse me, Mr. President,
but I do know how this is done.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.382
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.971
I'll start with Maine. [sighs]
She owes me.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.309
You know, we did meet
once before, Mr. President.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.811
At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.689
-I tried to introduce myself to you...
-And?

24:02.649 --> 24:05.069
-You don't remember, do you?
-Why would I?

24:08.655 --> 24:11.867
Why is the moderator
so interested in Brockhart's opinion?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.453
Has everyone suddenly forgotten
now I'm at the top of the ticket?

24:14.536 --> 24:15.787
No, of course not.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.083
Are we done here?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.668
Yeah. We should talk about
tomorrow's schedule. [sighs]

24:22.586 --> 24:25.631
Uh, vote's looking good now.
[inhales deeply]

24:25.714 --> 24:28.592
We still need to talk to as many
congressmen as we can.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.344
Well, you figure it out
and give us a call.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.055
And, uh, enough with the events
targeting the Armed Services.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.516
We got as many Congress people
as we could get out of this.

24:35.599 --> 24:39.145
No offense, General, but we need
to divide and conquer. Okay?

24:39.228 --> 24:41.730
Will, I was speaking with Mark...

24:41.813 --> 24:44.525
-Yeah.
-...and I want you to know,

24:44.608 --> 24:47.319
if you need to talk about anything,
I'm available.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.495
The only support I need, General...

24:57.413 --> 25:00.291
is that of a vice president
to his president. Okay?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.138
Senator Talbert's priorities
are affordable housing

25:14.221 --> 25:17.099
and closing corporate tax loopholes.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.685
And access to higher education especially.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.853
-The call is in ten.
-Mmm.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.022
Why did Aidan Macallan run away?

25:26.317 --> 25:27.859
What?

25:27.943 --> 25:30.654
Why did Macallan run away?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.656
I wish I could tell you.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.493
Clock's ticking.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.172
Yes, give me Tom Yates'
driver's number, please.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.557
[cell phone vibrates]

26:02.144 --> 26:03.145
Yes.

26:04.813 --> 26:05.856
Yes, ma'am.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.150
New York.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.944
You drove all the way to New York?

26:11.027 --> 26:12.113
Where?

26:14.531 --> 26:15.574
Who's he with?

26:15.657 --> 26:18.952
I don't know. A woman. Older.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.540
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.211
Yes. Yes, I'll try.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.597
No, I understand your concern, Senator.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
Student loan reform is a priority for you,

26:43.059 --> 26:45.604
so it will be a priority
for the president and me.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.441
Yes. Yes, I do.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.113
Well, Louise,
you as a pillar of the party,

26:55.197 --> 26:58.450
it will be much appreciated
if I can get your help tomorrow.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.119
And it'll just be you and me
and a couple of your...

27:02.496 --> 27:04.456
female colleagues in the Senate.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.461
Okay, well, I look forward
to a productive dialogue.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.404
-Better late than never.
-Sorry I missed dinner.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.911
-[sighs]
-Why the back?

27:42.994 --> 27:45.706
[sighs] I'm pretending you're an Uber.
Just help me out.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.750
My sister-in-law.
She came when you couldn't.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.726
[sighs]

28:16.528 --> 28:18.655
Do you think the dead judge us?

28:28.249 --> 28:29.250
No.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.093
[grunting softly]

28:48.310 --> 28:50.186
[continues grunting softly]

28:56.610 --> 28:58.320
[breathing heavily]

29:00.071 --> 29:02.241
[both sighing]

29:18.799 --> 29:20.926
What did he do
that you liked the most?

29:22.969 --> 29:26.056
Here... in bed.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.522
[sighs]

29:35.023 --> 29:36.317
Sitting up was the best.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.987
Legs around each other.

29:43.865 --> 29:48.954
He'd run his right hand up the back
of my neck into my hair and pull it.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.122
My hair and my head back...

29:55.377 --> 29:56.462
And?

30:01.925 --> 30:04.553
And with the other hand,
he'd pull me in and out.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.891
Always looking at me.

30:12.603 --> 30:13.770
Seeing me.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.945
You want me to do that?

30:26.992 --> 30:28.076
Yeah.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.505
[indistinct shouting in the distance]

30:40.422 --> 30:43.258
It's so nice in here.
You can hardly hear them.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.177
Oh, trust me, I can hear them.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.848
With New Hampshire, it's what?

30:51.057 --> 30:53.685
Twenty-four. With Maine, 25.

30:53.769 --> 30:57.731
-Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin.
-Where's Tom?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.816
He needed to get some air.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.028
-Wisconsin is being stubborn.
-Then who else?

31:04.279 --> 31:08.492
Iowa, maybe Colorado, 24, 25.

31:10.411 --> 31:13.539
How was your
great-great-great-grandfather Augustus?

31:14.456 --> 31:16.082
He goes by Eric.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.044
Eric.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.839
He admired my craftsmanship.

31:24.758 --> 31:28.261
-We should make a play for North Dakota.
-Agreed.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.807
In the Senate, I think you can
swing some votes from Missouri.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.268
Did you ask LeAnn about Macallan?

31:35.351 --> 31:37.688
She didn't know anything. I believe her.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.483
We have to quit again.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.029
Otherwise, they'll kill us.

31:55.831 --> 32:00.085
[man on phone] <i>No Macallan.</i>
<i>He was there, though. Left his belongings.</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:03.379
Anything from the National Police?

32:03.464 --> 32:08.301
<i>No. CIA's man in the palace</i>
<i>isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.</i>

32:08.384 --> 32:10.804
<i>They'll find him, LeAnn.</i>
<i>That's all I can give you.</i>

32:10.887 --> 32:11.930
I appreciate your help.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.187
Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.814
-I'm fine, thanks.
-I'm good with water.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.399
-What about you, Louise?
-What are you having?

32:24.610 --> 32:28.321
-Splash of vodka on ice.
-Make it two.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.283
Susan and I were talking
on the way over, Claire.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.996
This election mess has left us all
facing some scary possibilities.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.749
-Conway wins in the House--
-Which is far from inevitable.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.042
But if a split ticket were to happen...

32:41.126 --> 32:42.836
[chuckles] it would be
bad for this country.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.589
No, Conway is what
would be bad for this country.

32:46.548 --> 32:50.636
Let's hope the House does the right thing.
But as far as the Senate,

32:50.719 --> 32:53.514
I am very grateful that we have
Donald Blythe steering that ship.

32:53.597 --> 32:58.309
Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this,
but no matter what you're offering here,

32:58.393 --> 33:03.940
I can't support the president.
And, by extension, I can't support you.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.109
It's not you, Claire. It's him.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.571
Susan and I
are on the same page about this.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.741
[Louise] What if this isn't about
Francis Underwood, huh?

33:13.324 --> 33:16.995
It's Claire Underwood
who has the promising future.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.542
I want a woman in the White House.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.628
And if she has to start
as a vice president, fine.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.921
But it's time.

33:27.548 --> 33:32.844
-It's time.
-I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it...

33:32.928 --> 33:35.138
A vote for you
is a vote for Frank Underwood.

33:35.221 --> 33:39.726
Listen, I understand your concerns
about Francis' record. I do.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.021
If Conway wins,

33:43.104 --> 33:46.107
wouldn't you want a Democrat
to keep him in check?

33:48.234 --> 33:52.488
And what if a vote for me
isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.492
Twenty-one promised for you, sir.

33:56.577 --> 33:59.996
Twenty-three for Conway. Two deadlocked.
Four unknown.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.624
But I think things will shift
once they caucus.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.710
-All right, let's bring him in.
-Yes, sir.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.297
[Romero clears throat]

34:13.176 --> 34:15.219
-Have a seat.
-I won't be long.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.891
Well, then, stand like a man
who doesn't know whether to sit or not.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.311
Congressman Romero,
do you have good news for me?

34:23.393 --> 34:26.690
Have your progressives seen the light?

34:26.773 --> 34:29.735
I did what I could, Mr. President.
I couldn't sway the bloc.

34:34.697 --> 34:38.034
Couldn't... or wouldn't?

34:38.118 --> 34:39.870
Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.539
Congressman Wolcott
is turning Wisconsin for Conway.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.460
[Frank sighs]

34:49.670 --> 34:51.547
Tell me a different truth.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.509
They aren't listening to me.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.887
They believe supporting you
would do more damage

34:56.969 --> 35:00.223
to the Democratic Party and the country
than a Conway presidency.

35:04.269 --> 35:07.147
Well, I am sorry that it has come to this.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.608
[sighs]

35:09.691 --> 35:12.318
As am I.
I'm sure we'll meet again, sir.

35:12.402 --> 35:16.615
[Frank] Yes, but before you go,
just take a look around this room.

35:16.698 --> 35:20.410
Study every detail, every aspect.

35:21.662 --> 35:26.792
Because this is the last time
you will ever step foot in here.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.461
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.839
And to think you
could have made yourself memorable

35:32.923 --> 35:34.758
in so many other ways.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.561
I'll make sure
he never sees another committee, sir.

35:46.645 --> 35:50.816
Oh, no. He wants us to put up a fight,
make him feel bigger.

35:50.899 --> 35:53.318
He's just read some polls
and thinks I'm in trouble.

35:53.401 --> 35:57.613
That's why he's coming after me.
All right, we have 48 hours.

35:57.698 --> 36:00.241
I have to work Colorado
and shore up Tennessee.

36:00.325 --> 36:06.081
But Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire
must be turned by any means necessary.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.583
All caucusing will end
by noon on Thursday,

36:08.667 --> 36:12.963
and then the vote in both the House
and the Senate is scheduled for 2:00.

36:13.046 --> 36:16.257
Well... I don't make the decisions, Chuck.
I just relay them.

36:17.843 --> 36:21.137
No. No, there will not be
a statement at this time.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.515
[stammers] Well, because there's nothing
to state until after the vote.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.059
[softly] Close the door.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.937
Right. Yes.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.023
Yes.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.610
Yeah, please don't make me say yes again.
Mmm-hmm.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.489
Crazy days in these United States.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.744
[sighs] So you wanna tell me
what was so important

36:43.827 --> 36:47.288
-I had to get you through the gates?
-Girl named Lisa Williams came in.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.917
Says she was Rachel Posner's girlfriend.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.461
-[phone ringing]
-Said Doug Stamper knew Rachel.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.672
Feels like maybe he was involved
in her disappearance.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.884
And she said the words "Doug Stamper"?

36:58.967 --> 37:00.676
Rachel Posner went missing around the time

37:00.761 --> 37:02.678
Stamper was carjacked
and had his head bashed in.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.223
And this Lisa thinks...

37:06.266 --> 37:07.976
Well, she's not sure exactly.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.813
-Well, can she prove a connection?
-It's all instinct at this point.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.815
[sighs] Come on.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.985
You want a tour of the White House,
you could just straight up ask me for one.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.194
[scoffs]

37:19.445 --> 37:21.531
-Hammerschmidt.
-Is he making anything of it?

37:21.614 --> 37:25.118
Not yet. But the information about her
is on the top of his desk.

37:25.786 --> 37:26.870
Lisa Williams.

37:27.787 --> 37:28.621
[phone beeps]

37:28.705 --> 37:30.373
[woman] <i>Mr. Grayson,</i>
<i>you have a call on line three.</i>

37:30.456 --> 37:32.167
[sighs] Well, I gotta get back to it.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.252
If Tom follows up on her, let me know.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.048
-Thanks for the pass.
-It's temporary.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.220
Okay.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.724
[sighs]

37:50.977 --> 37:52.562
[cell phone vibrates]

37:55.273 --> 37:59.194
-[sighs] LeAnn Harvey.
-[Aidan] <i>Always burning the midnight oil.</i>

37:59.277 --> 38:01.863
-Aidan?
<i>-You ready to join me?</i>

38:02.781 --> 38:06.492
Do you have any idea
how much jeopardy you have put me in?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.578
<i>You should've gotten out</i>
<i>when you had the chance.</i>

38:08.661 --> 38:10.663
You think you're out?

38:10.746 --> 38:14.042
<i>-Listen, I need you to do me a favor.</i>
-Where are you?

38:14.125 --> 38:19.005
<i>Get the FBI, CIA, and whoever else</i>
<i>is looking for me to stop, now.</i>

38:19.089 --> 38:21.007
[sighs] Okay, Aidan, you know, just...

38:21.091 --> 38:23.593
come back here,
and we will figure this out together.

38:23.676 --> 38:27.889
<i>If they keep coming after me, I will start</i>
<i>leaking things about the Underwoods.</i>

38:28.807 --> 38:29.850
You don't wanna do that.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.768
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>who you're working for, LeAnn.</i>

38:34.855 --> 38:36.064
God damn it.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.608
You have an update for the president?

38:39.609 --> 38:42.570
I've been juggling senators
most of the day.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.030
And your congressman from Maine?

38:44.114 --> 38:47.408
Is still my friend's father
and is still too busy to meet.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.078
So was Wisconsin and New Hampshire,
until I forced them to.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.913
You have your style, I have mine.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.789
The president doesn't care
about style, LeAnn.

38:53.874 --> 38:56.417
Just get the congressman
by the vote on Thursday.

39:11.892 --> 39:13.768
Will just walked in.

39:13.852 --> 39:14.853
Yeah.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.106
Okay.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.108
Talk soon. Bye.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.153
[Hannah sighs]

39:25.363 --> 39:28.783
-That your mom?
-Yeah. She sends her best.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.118
Yeah, okay.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.955
-Where's Charlie?
-In the living room.

39:37.167 --> 39:40.295
Lily's playing in the den. [clears throat]

39:40.378 --> 39:42.047
-Where are you going?
-I should change.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.966
-You keep walking away from me, Hannah.
-Oh, please.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.760
Why would you invite him here?

39:48.761 --> 39:50.096
Now?

39:50.180 --> 39:52.348
He's a friend. He's your friend.

39:52.432 --> 39:57.687
And I thought maybe... it'd be something
that you'd be interested in looking at.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.315
-[scoffs]
-I'm doing all I can.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.524
-All you can?
-Yes.

40:01.607 --> 40:04.360
Like doubt me? Like think that you know
better what's in my mind than I do?

40:04.444 --> 40:05.778
You know, you're the one who told Mark.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.989
I had to deny
I had anything to do with it.

40:08.073 --> 40:12.327
See, these people, Hannah...
Usher and Marshall...

40:12.410 --> 40:15.871
they're hired hands.
They can't be trusted.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.458
And Brockhart, he's in it for himself.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.670
But... but you, my darling, my love--

40:22.753 --> 40:24.714
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

40:25.631 --> 40:28.343
What are you gonna do?
Take the kids and go to your mom?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.720
[scoffs] As if you would.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.015
You already picked out
the White House china.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.768
You want this more than anything.
To be president.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.357
Don't you dare judge me
now that I want it, too.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.660
Yes, Congressman,
but flights are considered bribes.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.624
Yes, Congressman,
it's not your DUIs that concern us,

40:59.707 --> 41:01.292
it's your daughter's.

41:02.377 --> 41:07.173
Well, you should've done a better job
hiding the payouts. I mean, really.

41:08.091 --> 41:12.595
Yes, I'm sure you are...
but how old was he again?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.349
Yes, and he was in the choir,
is that right?

41:17.808 --> 41:22.188
But you can never erase an e-mail,
even my dead aunt knows that.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.108
Well, get back to me as soon as you can.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.612
-So?
-Maine finally looks solid, sir.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.407
New Hampshire doesn't, though.

41:33.741 --> 41:37.495
I've been sitting in here for hours
busting my ass, getting some results.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.915
We should have secured New Hampshire.
How did LeAnn get Maine?

41:40.999 --> 41:42.583
She cashed in a favor.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.752
Well, why couldn't you
do the same goddamn thing?

41:44.835 --> 41:46.796
It doesn't make sense.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.549
I thought I had him. I mean...

41:50.466 --> 41:52.510
And it's not just New Hampshire.
Wisconsin should've folded.

41:52.593 --> 41:53.928
Should have?

41:54.845 --> 41:57.973
What's going on, Doug?
What's happening?

41:58.058 --> 42:02.812
Is there some issue with your commitment?
Your loyalty?

42:02.895 --> 42:03.896
What?

42:03.979 --> 42:06.524
Perhaps you
just aren't worthy of my trust.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.984
I have given everything to you.

42:09.069 --> 42:12.488
Almost the entirety
of my professional life, Frank.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.615
You watch your tone.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.244
The things I've done...

42:19.204 --> 42:20.830
The things that I have done
to help keep you here,

42:20.913 --> 42:22.873
and you're gonna question my loyalty?

42:24.584 --> 42:28.213
Well, if we can't win, we have to
make sure that Conway doesn't either.

42:28.296 --> 42:31.716
Maine coming over
only means he won't get to 26.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.009
A deadlock isn't a win. But at least...

42:36.596 --> 42:38.556
I'm sorry, Doug. I was out of line.

42:42.310 --> 42:43.603
Let's get back to work.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.365
It's not just what he did
with all the data.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.492
Aidan had access to everything.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.952
We need to get
the CIA and FBI off his trail,

43:00.035 --> 43:02.455
-and I need your help.
-You're causing problems, LeAnn,

43:02.538 --> 43:04.749
which is the last thing
that we can afford right now.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.961
-Macallan sealed his own fate.
-I delivered Maine, Doug,

43:09.044 --> 43:11.297
which is more than you can say
about New Hampshire.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.050
[sighs]

43:17.178 --> 43:18.179
I'll owe you.

43:19.472 --> 43:20.598
Not enough.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.103
Has the president spoken to you
about Aidan at all?

43:25.186 --> 43:26.187
No.

43:28.231 --> 43:29.982
Is he on a kill list?

43:30.065 --> 43:32.818
The United States of America
doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.783
I am the only thing preventing Mac
from releasing what he has.

43:38.866 --> 43:42.412
And my guess is, whatever it is,
it'll implicate you, too.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.456
Am I wrong, Doug?

44:03.683 --> 44:06.352
[LeAnn] Someone close to Senator Mitchell
woke me up with the news.

44:06.436 --> 44:07.812
[Frank] Get me the vice president
on the phone.

44:07.895 --> 44:08.938
[Claire] That is not going to help.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.023
[Frank] Well, how do you
intend on dealing with it?

44:22.618 --> 44:23.828
Donald.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.873
-Don't do it.
-Claire--

44:27.957 --> 44:30.876
I know what you and Senator Mitchell
were planning.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.753
Do what you were supposed to do.

44:32.837 --> 44:36.090
Move the anti-filibuster measure forward
so the Senate can vote

44:36.174 --> 44:38.343
-and elect me vice president.
-No.

44:38.426 --> 44:40.470
-No?
-All voices should be heard

44:40.553 --> 44:42.763
out of respect for the American people

44:42.847 --> 44:45.016
and the gravity of the vote
before the Senate today,

44:45.099 --> 44:47.768
the first like this since 1825.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.396
The House is about to vote, Donald.
What is going on?

44:50.480 --> 44:52.565
Let's get this done so you can go home.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.901
It looks like Conway is going to win.

44:55.985 --> 44:59.489
And no matter what people have told you,
the Senate is voting for Brockhart.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.991
-It's country over party, Claire.
-Are you flexing?

45:02.074 --> 45:06.954
I'm stalling until the House vote happens
and then the Senate votes accordingly.

45:07.037 --> 45:10.082
You'd do that to the party to which
you've devoted your entire career?

45:10.165 --> 45:13.753
The country needs clarity and resolution.
That's the most important thing.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.256
There'll be another election
in four years.

45:16.339 --> 45:18.132
But look...

45:18.215 --> 45:20.885
I saw you when Francis was in the coma.

45:20.968 --> 45:24.514
What you're capable of
when given the opportunity.

45:25.431 --> 45:29.894
[sighs] You still have a shot
down the road. I'd vote for you.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.731
Whatever you think,
I know I have the numbers.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.190
I don't think so.

45:36.859 --> 45:37.985
But come on.

45:40.613 --> 45:43.574
You're not like him. Be patient.

45:46.661 --> 45:49.705
You're a fool, Donald.
You always were.

45:49.789 --> 45:54.084
You and your dumb, dead wife
that you never, ever shut up about.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.504
Principled? Idealistic?

45:56.587 --> 45:59.715
A champion for the people?
What did you ever actually do?

46:00.300 --> 46:01.967
Nothing.

46:02.051 --> 46:05.388
The great crusader?
I don't think so.

46:05.471 --> 46:09.058
You just liked the position
of the bumbling idiot that you are.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.020
The optimist. The idealist.

46:13.103 --> 46:15.856
You loved it so much
that you couldn't even make a deal

46:15.940 --> 46:17.900
or move a single thing forward.

46:17.983 --> 46:20.320
You have a legacy of nothing.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.989
Sign the measure,
get the Republicans off the floor,

46:24.073 --> 46:25.866
start the vote now.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.580
Do you know what I just realized?

46:31.872 --> 46:33.082
Your initials...

46:34.249 --> 46:36.711
they're missing an "n" and a "t".

47:06.115 --> 47:07.658
[door opens]

47:13.205 --> 47:15.332
The vote is inconclusive, Mr. President.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.128
Neither you nor Conway to 26.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.881
Still alive. What about Claire?

47:23.424 --> 47:26.511
[stammers] This is impossible.

47:26.594 --> 47:29.096
I'm as surprised as you are.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.807
Maine. There was no heads-up on that.

47:33.518 --> 47:36.186
Look, I know this is frustrating.
It should be over.

47:36.270 --> 47:38.188
I... I'm the president.

47:39.774 --> 47:41.609
I don't care what they say, I...

47:42.527 --> 47:44.820
I'm fucking
President of the United States.

47:44.904 --> 47:45.946
[Mark] No, you're not.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.240
The vice president
will be acting president

47:48.323 --> 47:50.701
for as long as it takes
the House to decide.

47:50.785 --> 47:51.994
[sighs]

47:53.328 --> 47:54.747
I should make some calls.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.126
[chuckles]

48:03.464 --> 48:04.674
[sighs]

48:05.305 --> 48:11.707
