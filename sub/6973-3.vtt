- Hello?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.563
Hello!

00:33.600 --> 00:35.534
Hey, I'm sittin' here,
dude!

00:35.602 --> 00:39.265
[Man Over Speaker]
Sorry. We're closed.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.933
Uh-uh. I was here before
you turned off the light.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.909
Grandfather clause, man.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.105
I need a Super Patty Double
with cheese...

00:47.180 --> 00:49.171
The light was a mistake.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.183
We're closed. Sorry.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.549
The light was on!

00:53.620 --> 00:56.088
How bad do you want this job? 'Cause
I'll call the head office right now!

00:56.156 --> 00:59.250

super size Diet Sprite.

and you control everything
you do.

03:38.917 --> 03:41.385
- How ya doin'?
- Hey, Rob.

03:41.453 --> 03:43.387
- Hey, Mr. Rice.
- How's it going, Rob?

03:45.624 --> 03:47.785
- Have a good one, Lucy.
- You too, Rob.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.600
[Siren Wails]

04:04.509 --> 04:06.443
Welcome to Lucky Boy.
May I take your order?

04:06.511 --> 04:10.948
- Yeah, we'll have it our way.
- F.B.I. Special Agents
Scully and Mulder.

04:11.016 --> 04:15.350
- We'd like a word with
your manager, please.
- How can I help you?

04:15.420 --> 04:18.446
Sir, would you do us a favor
and gather your employees, please?

04:18.523 --> 04:20.957
- What's going on?
- We're investigating a murder.

04:21.026 --> 04:25.520
A car was found in a reservoir
ten miles from here. A body
was found in the trunk of that car.

04:25.597 --> 04:29.397
- Well, what does that have
to do with us?
- This was also found in the car.

04:29.468 --> 04:33.370
It's a badge that's only given
to employees. Is that correct?

04:33.438 --> 04:35.633
Yeah. "Free Fer Fridays."
It's our promotion...

04:35.707 --> 04:37.641
where you buy one Super Patty
and get one free.

04:37.709 --> 04:41.372
But look, there's four Lucky Boys
in Costa Mesa alone,

04:41.446 --> 04:43.380
and something like
30 in Orange County.

04:43.448 --> 04:45.609
- Thirty-two.
- Yeah, long day,
so let's make this quick.

04:45.684 --> 04:48.812
- Does everybody have their button?
- We only wear them on Fridays.

04:48.887 --> 04:50.821
"Free Fer Fridays."

04:52.190 --> 04:54.488
Yeah, but does everybody
have their button?

05:14.746 --> 05:18.273
Hey, uh, you back there.
What's your name?

05:18.350 --> 05:20.284
Derwood Spinks.

05:20.352 --> 05:23.116
Derwood. Do you have
your button, Derwood?

05:23.188 --> 05:25.349
Uh, no, I must have
left it at home,

05:25.424 --> 05:28.154
on account of we're supposed to
only wear 'em on Fridays.

05:31.596 --> 05:33.689
Well, I sure as hell didn't
leave it on no dead guy.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.126
I don't believe that we said
the victim was male.

05:39.204 --> 05:41.331
We're gonna ask everybody
to step outside right now...

05:41.406 --> 05:45.433
- while we take a quick look
around the premises.
- Who was the victim?

05:46.712 --> 05:48.703
His name was
Donald Edward Pankow.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.714
Does that ring a bell?

05:50.782 --> 05:53.808
No.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.059
I'm gonna get
some cigarettes.

06:15.741 --> 06:17.971
I guess I'd better call
the corporate headquarters...

06:18.043 --> 06:20.068
and find out what
they want us to do.

06:25.884 --> 06:27.852
[Mulder]
Hey, Scully.

06:27.919 --> 06:30.319
Check it out.
You know how they say...

06:30.388 --> 06:33.380
you never wanna see the kitchen
of any of your favorite restaurants?

06:33.458 --> 06:37.519
Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy
would make that list.

06:37.596 --> 06:40.827
My point being that this is a hell
of a lot cleaner than all the others.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.925
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

06:44.002 --> 06:46.835
So what are you saying, Mulder?
This place has been scrubbed
from top to bottom...

06:46.905 --> 06:50.306
- [Continues Over Loudspeaker]
To cover up evidence?
- [Mulder] Maybe.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.936
Maybe I'm thinking
this was the crime scene.

06:54.012 --> 06:56.105
[Scully] You're saying
Mr. Pankow had his brain...

06:56.181 --> 06:59.617
very neatly removed from his skull
right here in this kitchen?

06:59.684 --> 07:01.743
It had to happen somewhere.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.254
But next to
the shake machine, Mulder?

07:04.322 --> 07:06.415
I think that we should be
checking out employee lockers,

07:06.491 --> 07:10.222
and not entertaining the idea that
ad hoc surgery was performed here.

07:10.295 --> 07:13.560
I wouldn't exactly
call it "surgery."

07:13.632 --> 07:18.695
What if this man's brain was eaten?
It's not sociologically unheard of.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.967
There are certain tribes in New Guinea
that consider human brains a delicacy.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.305
- Yeah, but, Mulder,
we're in Orange County.
- Yeah? What's your point?

07:25.377 --> 07:27.311
It's just that...

07:27.379 --> 07:30.246
nothing about the way the body was
dumped suggests a fetishistic killing.

07:30.315 --> 07:32.249
The brain
wasn't removed intact.

07:32.317 --> 07:34.478
What if this man's brain
was eaten right out of his skull?

07:34.553 --> 07:38.421
Through an inch and a half opening that
looks like it was cut with a hole saw?

07:38.490 --> 07:41.186
[Mulder] Well, maybe it was cut.
Maybe it was punched.

07:41.259 --> 07:44.319
What looked like tool marks
to you looked to me like
something more organic.

07:44.396 --> 07:47.263
Like it was made by a...

07:47.332 --> 07:50.597
a tongue, or a proboscis.

07:50.669 --> 07:53.433
The proboscis of what?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.174
I don't know.

07:57.242 --> 08:00.336
Oh. Hello.
Look at this.

08:01.913 --> 08:04.347
Does that look
like blood to you?

08:04.416 --> 08:08.011
- [Scully] Yes, it looks like it.
- [Mulder] What is that?

08:08.086 --> 08:11.283
Next to it.
Is that, uh...

08:11.356 --> 08:14.484
Oh, my... Uh. Is that brain...
Is that brain matter there?

08:14.559 --> 08:18.086
No, I'd say
that's ground beef.

08:18.163 --> 08:21.833
- [Mulder] Ground beef?
- Yeah.

09:00.872 --> 09:02.772
[Knocking On Door]

09:10.414 --> 09:14.248
Rob Roberts?
It's Agent Mulder.

09:17.755 --> 09:20.087
Hello, again.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

09:20.157 --> 09:22.091
- No. No bother.
- Can I come in?

09:22.159 --> 09:24.354
- Yeah, s-sure. Sure.
- Great. Great.

09:24.428 --> 09:26.328
Uh, what...
what can I do for you?

09:26.397 --> 09:29.855
- You live here alone?
- Yeah, it's just me.

09:29.934 --> 09:32.198
- Mom or girlfriend?
- What?

09:32.270 --> 09:34.261
Come on, man.
Who cleans up after you?

09:34.338 --> 09:38.001
Neither. It's just me.
L-I live here alone.

09:38.075 --> 09:41.738
Well, bravo. You know, they say single
guys are just bears who own furniture.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.406
I mean, my place,
it's...

09:44.482 --> 09:47.042
But here, you can smell
the Pine Sol.

09:47.118 --> 09:49.916
- Thanks. Can l...
Can I get you anything?
- Yeah.

09:49.987 --> 09:52.455
Yeah, a cheeseburger
and a large order of fries.

09:54.525 --> 09:57.392
[Weak Chuckle]
It's a bad joke. I'm sorry.

09:57.461 --> 10:00.328
Um, Mr. Rice,
your manager,

10:00.398 --> 10:03.629
he told me that, uh,
you stayed late on Friday.

10:03.701 --> 10:05.635
- Is that right?
- Uh, yeah, sure. Friday.

10:05.703 --> 10:07.694
The freezer had died on us.

10:07.772 --> 10:10.536
I stayed after to throw out
the meat that was goin' bad.

10:10.608 --> 10:13.873
- Yeah, did you volunteer to close?
- Yeah.

10:13.945 --> 10:16.277
Yeah, okay.
You volunteered.

10:16.347 --> 10:18.281
Volunteered.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.118
Um...

10:22.186 --> 10:25.314
The, uh... The 35 pounds
of ground chuck...

10:25.389 --> 10:27.653
that Mr. Rice told you to throw away...
what did you do with that?

10:27.725 --> 10:29.784
- I threw it out.
- Where?

10:29.860 --> 10:32.624
In the Dumpster...
behind the restaurant.

10:32.697 --> 10:35.757
Hmm. That's weird.

10:35.833 --> 10:39.064
That's what I figured you did, so I
checked the Dumpster, and it was empty.

10:39.136 --> 10:41.570
Which is weird because
it only gets cleaned out on Thursday,

10:41.639 --> 10:43.573
and you would've thrown away
the meat on Friday.

10:43.641 --> 10:47.077
So you'd expect the meat
to be there, right?

10:47.144 --> 10:50.807
I don't see how that's relevant
to this murder case anyway.

10:50.881 --> 10:53.145
Let me see if there's anything else
I wanted to ask you.

10:54.652 --> 10:56.586
Blood.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.984
You're-You're bleeding.

11:05.696 --> 11:07.630
L-I bit my lip.

11:07.698 --> 11:09.962
Hmm.

11:10.034 --> 11:13.026
I think that just about
wraps it up for me here, actually.

11:13.104 --> 11:16.369
Oh, hey, I, uh... I hope
you catch the guy, huh?

11:16.440 --> 11:19.603
No, I already got
a pretty good idea who it is.

11:19.677 --> 11:21.611
Thanks.

12:16.934 --> 12:20.233
- What do you want?
- N-Nothing.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.704
So take a hike.

12:29.847 --> 12:31.906
[Telephone Ringing]

12:31.982 --> 12:35.941
[Woman Over Machine] Uh, hi.
This is a message for Rob Roberts.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.750
My name is
Dr. Mindy Reinhart,

12:38.823 --> 12:41.018
and I'm a licensed
mental health counselor...

12:41.092 --> 12:44.823
with the Lucky Boy Corporation's
Employee Assistance Program.

12:44.895 --> 12:47.523
I'm talking to all of
the employees at your restaurant...

12:47.598 --> 12:50.931
about the recent unpleasantness
that occurred there.

12:51.001 --> 12:54.960
Rob, I'd love for you to come down to my
offce at 11;00 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

12:55.039 --> 12:58.770
As it is a requirement of your
employer's insurance provider,

12:58.843 --> 13:01.038
this meeting is mandatory.

13:01.112 --> 13:05.105
I'm in the Irvine Medical Park,
suite 308.

13:05.182 --> 13:08.743
- Have a good evening.
- [Machine Beeps]

13:16.794 --> 13:18.728
[Stomach Growling Loudly]

13:26.904 --> 13:29.896
Self-discipline.
That's the name of this game.

13:29.974 --> 13:33.137
That's the one thing
that separates us from the animals,

13:33.210 --> 13:35.144
provided you have it.

13:35.212 --> 13:37.271
So where do you get it?
You can't go down...

13:37.348 --> 13:39.714
to the local convenience store
and buy self-discipline.

13:39.783 --> 13:42.513
You can't order it over the internet.
So where does it come from?

13:42.586 --> 13:47.319
True story. I used to weigh 356 pounds.
[Whistles]

13:47.391 --> 13:50.087
Do you believe that?
Well, it's true.

13:50.161 --> 13:52.254
I lived to eat,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:52.329 --> 13:56.527
My entire life revolved around eating,
because I was always hungry.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.569
My appetite
was controlling me.

13:59.637 --> 14:02.435
Four-star restaurants, Denny's...
It didn't matter, and it didn't stop.

14:02.506 --> 14:04.770
It didn't stop until
I took charge of my own life.

14:04.842 --> 14:07.868
It didn't stop until I put on
the brakes and I said, "Whoa!"

14:07.945 --> 14:10.778
[Together]
Ricardo, you are your own man,

14:10.848 --> 14:13.715
and you control everything
that you do.

14:13.784 --> 14:15.718
[Applause]

14:33.604 --> 14:36.505
Oh, brother.
What?

14:42.112 --> 14:44.046
[Gasps, Screams]

14:44.114 --> 14:46.048
[Flesh Tearing]

14:58.161 --> 15:00.789
[Gasps]
What... Derwood.

15:00.864 --> 15:03.389
How did you get in here?

15:04.701 --> 15:08.159
It's a little skill
I picked up in Chino.

15:08.238 --> 15:10.172
I did a nickel
for attempted murder.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.269
You didn't know
I was an ex-con?

15:14.344 --> 15:17.245
Yeah,
nobody at work did.

15:17.314 --> 15:19.805
Not until this F.B.I.
Murder investigation...

15:19.883 --> 15:21.817
whipped everybody up
into a froth.

15:27.858 --> 15:30.088
Derwood,
what can I do for you?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.822
You know I got fired
last night?

15:34.431 --> 15:37.229
Stupid little
pissant job,

15:37.300 --> 15:39.359
where they make you wear
a paper hat.

15:39.436 --> 15:41.802
And they fred me.
Plus, as far as that, uh,

15:41.872 --> 15:44.170
redheaded F.B. I agent's
concerned,

15:44.241 --> 15:46.175
I'm the prime suspect
in this murder.

15:47.711 --> 15:49.872
But that's no skin off my nose,
seeing as you did it.

16:00.924 --> 16:02.789
Diet pills.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.929
Yours, right?

16:06.997 --> 16:10.160
See, I found 'em when
I opened up on Saturday morning.

16:10.233 --> 16:14.169
I didn't give 'em back because
I figured, hey, free speed, right?

16:14.237 --> 16:16.705
But then there's this
whole flap about a murder,

16:16.773 --> 16:18.900
and I noticed this.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.246
That ain't ketchup, man.

16:26.816 --> 16:28.841
What-What do you want,
Derwood?

16:31.021 --> 16:33.683
I don't know.
What do you got?

16:35.091 --> 16:37.025
TV, VCR.

16:37.093 --> 16:40.392
Nah, it's all crappy,
off-brand stuff.

16:40.463 --> 16:43.591
But, you know, I'll take that,
and whatever money you got in the bank,

16:43.667 --> 16:47.398
and you get this,
and I keep my mouth shut.

16:47.470 --> 16:50.371
And just maybe
you can blow town...

16:50.440 --> 16:54.171
before the long arm of the law
reaches out and grabs you by the gonads.

16:54.244 --> 16:56.337
[Knocking]

16:57.447 --> 16:59.381
Maybe not.

17:01.484 --> 17:03.384
Cup 'em.

17:03.453 --> 17:05.717
Uh... Hi.

17:05.789 --> 17:07.586
Uh, Rob?

17:07.656 --> 17:11.184
I hate to bother you, but last night
in the front of the building,

17:11.261 --> 17:13.194
there was a man
in a parked car for hours.

17:13.262 --> 17:16.790
Did you happen to see him?
It was a maroon car.

17:16.866 --> 17:18.800
He was pretty clean-cut,
so I didn't call the police.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.701
But he was still there
when I went to bed.

17:21.771 --> 17:24.103
Gee, Sylvia, I don't know
what to tell you.

17:24.174 --> 17:27.701
Well, he's gone now, but just,
you know, keep your eyes out
in case he comes back.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.711
- You got it.
- Thanks.

17:34.284 --> 17:36.377
- [Door Closes]
- So I'll call you tonight
and let you know...

17:36.453 --> 17:38.978
where to drop off
my new VCR.

17:41.124 --> 17:44.651
Oh. And don't try
skipping town.

17:44.728 --> 17:47.253
You won't get too far.

17:59.009 --> 18:01.375
[Car Door Opens,
Closes]

18:01.444 --> 18:04.572
Hey, just the man
I wanted to see.

18:04.647 --> 18:06.581
How are you
this morning, Rob?

18:06.649 --> 18:09.777
- Fine.
- Yeah. I'm glad I caught you.

18:09.853 --> 18:12.253
Oh, hey, I was just
driving to your apartment,

18:12.322 --> 18:14.882
and I saw Derwood Spinks
not a block from here.

18:14.958 --> 18:18.587
- He wasn't coming from your place
by any chance, was he?
- No, I haven't seen him.

18:18.661 --> 18:22.495
Good. I'd stay away from him. He's
our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.

18:22.565 --> 18:25.830
- You think he did it?
- Me? No. No, I should say...

18:25.902 --> 18:29.133
that's the opinion of the
Costa Mesa Police, and my partner.

18:29.205 --> 18:31.196
So he's not your guy?

18:31.274 --> 18:34.368
No. No, I think we're looking for
somebody who has a compulsion to kill.

18:34.444 --> 18:37.470
Truly can't help himself.

18:37.547 --> 18:42.314
Oh, quick question. The, uh... The meat
that you threw in the Dumpster?

18:42.385 --> 18:44.853
- What about it?
- The Dumpster had a padlock.

18:44.921 --> 18:46.855
- Yeah.
- Who would have the key?

18:46.923 --> 18:48.857
We do,

18:48.925 --> 18:51.189
and the
trucking company does.

18:53.630 --> 18:56.861
Hey, wait.
What's your point?

18:56.933 --> 18:59.527
I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

19:05.608 --> 19:08.736
[Reinhart] Good, you got my message,
Rob. I appreciate your coming.

19:10.246 --> 19:12.942
This will be really informal.
Here you go.

19:13.016 --> 19:15.678
I wanna run through
some things with you.

19:15.752 --> 19:19.244
We don't stand on ceremony here,
so if there's anything that
you want to talk about,

19:19.322 --> 19:21.313
just go ahead
and blurt it out, okay?

19:23.093 --> 19:25.561
Hasn't been a run-of-the-mill week
so far, has it?

19:25.628 --> 19:27.562
No.

19:27.630 --> 19:30.064
The police have been at the restaurant,
and the F.B.I.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.567
I'm sure this has been
a very stressful time for you.

19:32.635 --> 19:34.432
Pretty much.

19:34.504 --> 19:37.268
So we wanna keep on top
of any potential problems...

19:37.340 --> 19:39.399
that these stresses
might cause for you.

19:39.476 --> 19:43.537
- So let's run through some
standard questions together.
- [Stomach Growling Loudly]

19:43.613 --> 19:46.047
[Shuffling Papers]

19:46.116 --> 19:48.744
Rob, have you been troubled
recently by insomnia?

19:50.286 --> 19:53.256
- Bad dreams? Nightmares?
- [Growling Continues]

19:53.256 --> 19:54.525

emotionally numb?

19:54.525 --> 19:56.390
Have you felt
emotionally numb?

that aren't there, or hear voices?

[Heartbeat Pounding Loudly]

20:07.938 --> 20:11.271
- Tell me, Rob, do you feel...
- This...

20:11.341 --> 20:14.538
This murder...
This murder that happened?

20:14.611 --> 20:16.044
Yes?

20:18.215 --> 20:20.649
What kind of a monster
would do something like that?

20:22.719 --> 20:24.653
I don't believe
in monsters.

20:26.690 --> 20:28.749
But I do believe
in people.

20:28.825 --> 20:30.816
And sometimes,
they do terrible things...

20:30.894 --> 20:34.330
out of weakness
or sickness or fear.

20:36.099 --> 20:38.829
But I do truly believe
that deep down inside,

20:38.902 --> 20:41.063
even the worst of us
wants to be good.

20:41.138 --> 20:46.132
Rob, is there anything that's troubling
you that you'd like to talk about?

20:48.645 --> 20:50.636
[Telephone Ringing]

20:50.714 --> 20:53.308
I'm sorry.
I thought I put that on voice mail.

20:56.887 --> 20:59.447
Mindy Reinhart.

20:59.523 --> 21:01.684
Yes, Agent Mulder.
What can I do for you?

21:04.027 --> 21:07.190
No, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

21:07.264 --> 21:11.132
I'm sorry, but it would violate
patient confidentiality.

21:11.201 --> 21:13.135

21:13.203 --> 21:15.763
Excuse me, Agent...
Rob?

Yeah? I have to
go to work now.

Would you please call me later
so that we can finish our talk?

21:38.629 --> 21:42.156
You shouldn't be here, Derwood.
We would've mailed you your last check.

my money, Rice.

for me too, huh?

There.
Now please leave.

a brain in his head.

You said we should
finish talking.

- Tell me why you think that.

25:30.959 --> 25:33.120
I have compulsions
to eat.

25:33.195 --> 25:37.097
L-I get hungry. And I try to
put it off for as long as I can,

25:37.165 --> 25:41.397
but then finally, I just... I get so
hungry that I can't help myself, and...

25:41.470 --> 25:43.904
You binge, then purge?

25:43.972 --> 25:47.635
You eat too much,
and then cause yourself to vomit?

25:50.579 --> 25:53.207
No.
I just eat.

25:53.282 --> 25:56.308
But this makes you feel bad.

25:56.385 --> 25:59.684
I guess it makes me feel
like I'm not a good person.

25:59.755 --> 26:03.657
Rob, there are so many
different kinds of eating disorders.

26:03.725 --> 26:06.159
Men and women from every walk
of life suffer from them.

26:06.228 --> 26:10.722
But if there's one thing that they all
have in common, it's low self-esteem.

26:10.799 --> 26:14.394
And it's a shame because low self-esteem
can be like a fun house mirror.

26:14.469 --> 26:19.202
It reflects back
a warped and ugly image of ourselves.

26:19.274 --> 26:22.573

look like in a fun house mirror?

26:22.644 --> 26:24.874
Uh, weird?

- Ugly.
- And how would the most
handsome man in the world look?

How would, say, PeterJennings
look in a fun house mirror?

26:33.822 --> 26:38.020

26:40.996 --> 26:44.295
Do you think that looks
like a bad person?

26:44.366 --> 26:47.858
An unworthy person?
I'll tell you what I see.

26:47.936 --> 26:50.871
I see a nice smile.

I see soulful brown eyes.

26:52.941 --> 26:55.432
I see good.

26:55.510 --> 26:58.001
Now, Rob, I want you
to keep looking into this mirror...

26:58.080 --> 27:00.048
until you see
the same things that I do.

27:02.217 --> 27:04.777

I'd like you to attend tonight.

anytime you want.

- You always hurry away.

to understand...

that I really am trying
to do right.

[Door Closes]

28:11.720 --> 28:16.054
- Hey, Rob, you didn't tell me
you had a friend in the F.B.I.
- What?

28:16.124 --> 28:20.026
He's upstairs. I told him all about
that strange man in the maroon car,

28:20.095 --> 28:22.325
and he said
he'd look into it.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.334
Afternoon, Rob.

28:28.603 --> 28:31.970
Sir, may we speak with you?

28:34.009 --> 28:36.034
Derwood Spinks
has disappeared.

28:36.111 --> 28:39.080
His car is gone,
along with some personal belongings.

28:39.147 --> 28:42.605
My partner saw Spinks in your
neighborhood yesterday morning.

28:42.684 --> 28:45.653
At that time, you told Agent Mulder
that you hadn't seen Mr. Spinks.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.518
Is that correct?

28:48.590 --> 28:50.751
I don't even know him
that well.

28:50.826 --> 28:54.193
If he was going to leave town,
he wouldn't come tell me about it.

28:54.262 --> 28:57.857
Who said he left town?

28:57.933 --> 29:01.733
I don't know. Isn't that
what you think happened?

29:01.803 --> 29:04.636
No, no. Uh, personally,
I think he's dead.

29:04.706 --> 29:08.198
I can't speak for my partner,
but I think that whatever it was...

29:08.276 --> 29:12.076
that killed Donald Pankow
also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks.

29:13.348 --> 29:15.282
What do... What do you mean,
whatever it was?

29:15.350 --> 29:18.911
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

29:18.987 --> 29:21.046
We've been able to keep it
pretty quiet up until now,

29:21.123 --> 29:23.751
but Donald Pankow's brain
was missing from his skull.

29:23.825 --> 29:26.726
My partner was able to find something
that was previously undetected.

29:26.795 --> 29:28.854
It was the tip of what
could only be described...

29:28.930 --> 29:31.592
as a tiny shark's tooth
embedded deep in the bone.

29:33.869 --> 29:36.565
I think we're looking for
some kind of genetic freak...

29:36.638 --> 29:39.004
a carnivorous predator
as yet unidentified.

29:39.074 --> 29:41.235
A monster, if you will.

29:43.111 --> 29:45.045
There's no such thing.

29:45.113 --> 29:48.810
Well, don't you believe it.
This thing defnitely qualifes.

29:48.884 --> 29:50.818
It has a biological
imperative to eat.

29:50.886 --> 29:53.286
I think it even ate
that ground chuck you threw away.

29:53.355 --> 29:55.823
Yeah? Why?

29:55.891 --> 29:59.122
Because it can't kill with impunity,
and it knows it.

29:59.194 --> 30:03.332
It knows that the more
it feeds on humans,
the closer it gets to getting caught.

30:03.465 --> 30:05.831
But the hunger
is always there,

30:05.901 --> 30:07.994
and it satisfies it
anyway it can.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.376
I'm-I'm sorry,

30:15.444 --> 30:19.346
but this is like
good cop, insane cop.

30:21.183 --> 30:24.448
Why are you telling me
all of this?

30:24.519 --> 30:26.646
I think you know why.

30:28.056 --> 30:30.286
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

30:30.359 --> 30:32.691
We'll contact you
if we have any further questions.

30:37.432 --> 30:39.366

school fund-raiser.

And at 3;00 in the morning
the night before there they are,

31:22.544 --> 31:25.012
all three dozen of'em,

31:25.080 --> 31:27.344
lined up
and calling to me.

- [Stomach Growling Loudly]
- Well, you know, in the past,

31:29.418 --> 31:33.252
there would have been a good chance
I would've gone through
every single last one of them.

Small world, huh?

31:36.892 --> 31:39.656

at a meeting?

- Yeah.

they want to share?

Everybody's really nice.

an eating disorder.

32:27.843 --> 32:31.040
I'm defnitely
a meat eater,

32:31.112 --> 32:33.046
not a vegetarian.

32:33.114 --> 32:38.518
I've always had these cravings...
my whole life.

32:38.587 --> 32:41.078
And just-just recently,

32:41.156 --> 32:44.614
the last month or so,

32:44.693 --> 32:47.059
they've just become
too powerful to resist.

32:47.128 --> 32:49.062
Tell us about it.

32:49.130 --> 32:53.226
I guess it's the taste
I respond to the most.

32:54.569 --> 32:57.800
Salty and... juicy.

32:57.873 --> 32:59.807
Kind of buttery.

32:59.875 --> 33:04.812
- [Groaning]
- The texture of it
inside of your mouth...

33:04.880 --> 33:08.213
You know, your teeth
just sink into it...

33:08.283 --> 33:11.480
like this juicy cloud.

33:11.553 --> 33:13.851
And it tastes so good.

33:13.922 --> 33:16.186
You know, you don't even
wanna swallow it.

33:16.258 --> 33:18.818
You just wanna work it
around your taste buds...

33:18.894 --> 33:22.489
until your eyes roll
right back into your head.

33:22.564 --> 33:24.998
[Heartbeat Pounding]

33:26.167 --> 33:28.601
Do you remember when
I first came here?

33:45.253 --> 33:48.814
Anyway, it's a real problem.

33:49.891 --> 33:51.825
[Rob Laughing]

33:51.893 --> 33:54.453
Wait.
Your ex-husband did what?

33:54.529 --> 33:57.362
He said I was too fat
to ride in his sports car...

33:57.432 --> 34:00.196
that I'd just
mess up the springs.

34:00.268 --> 34:03.396
So I sat on the hood
and I bounced.

34:05.206 --> 34:08.107
And I didn't stop
until the police showed up.

34:08.176 --> 34:10.110
They sided with me.

34:11.146 --> 34:14.013
Hey, thank you, Sylvia.

34:14.081 --> 34:16.016
Good night, Rob.

34:17.418 --> 34:19.909
Good night, Sylvia.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.356
[Stomach Growling Loudly]

34:50.552 --> 34:52.485
I'll be right there.

35:36.597 --> 35:38.531
[Screaming]

35:57.351 --> 35:59.979
[Man]
What the hell is going on?

36:00.054 --> 36:03.512
Oh, my God!
Call the police!

36:03.591 --> 36:05.616
[Woman]
Everything okay?

36:09.063 --> 36:10.997
[Police Radio Chattering]

36:14.301 --> 36:16.895
Mr. Derwood Spinks,
alive and well.

36:19.673 --> 36:23.200
You know what, folks? Why don't we
go outside and talk about it there.

36:25.446 --> 36:27.641
I'm confused, Rob.

36:27.715 --> 36:29.649
Was he helping you
redecorate?

36:31.318 --> 36:34.014
- I lied to you before.
- About what?

36:34.088 --> 36:36.386
Derwood was...

36:36.457 --> 36:40.120
was coming from my place
the morning you saw him.

36:40.194 --> 36:43.095
He said if I spoke to you,
he'd kill me.

36:43.164 --> 36:46.031
What didn't he want you
to tell us?

36:46.100 --> 36:48.034
Last Friday night,

36:48.102 --> 36:50.935
he hung out while I was
cleaning out the freezer.

36:52.406 --> 36:55.898
He told me to go home,
said he'd finish up.

36:55.976 --> 37:00.379
You know, l... I didn't know why
the hell he was being so nice to me.

37:00.448 --> 37:03.246
But when I got home,

37:03.317 --> 37:07.617
I realized I had the key
to the Dumpster.

37:07.688 --> 37:09.622
And when I drove back,

37:11.392 --> 37:14.884
I saw him cleaning up
all this blood.

37:14.962 --> 37:16.793
You must have been
very scared.

37:16.864 --> 37:21.392
I was, but you know, I should have
told the truth from the start.

37:21.469 --> 37:23.767
Do you recognize
this guy?

37:30.211 --> 37:32.304
- No.
- Hmm.

37:32.379 --> 37:35.507
He's a private eye.
Sylvia Jassie's ex-husband...

37:35.583 --> 37:37.517
hired him to spy on her.

37:38.919 --> 37:41.717
But now this Steve Kiziak
is gone missing.

37:41.789 --> 37:44.519
He was last seen
parked outside your apartment.

37:44.592 --> 37:46.526
You didn't notice him?

37:46.594 --> 37:49.392
No, l-I didn't...
notice anything.

37:51.832 --> 37:53.766
Well, maybe we should check
with Sylvia again.

37:53.834 --> 37:56.701
I don't...
I don't think she's home.

37:56.770 --> 37:59.261
Ah, well,
we'll track her down.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.371
Don't worry, Rob.
It won't be long now.

38:21.028 --> 38:22.962
[Reinhart]
Oh, my God.

38:23.864 --> 38:26.856
Rob?
What happened?

38:28.269 --> 38:30.794
It's a long story.

38:30.871 --> 38:33.203
What do...
What do you want?

38:33.274 --> 38:36.402
I, uh... I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd say hi.

38:38.946 --> 38:42.905
- Hi.
- Rob, are you all right?

38:47.721 --> 38:49.655
Did you do this?

38:51.025 --> 38:55.052
No!
Derwood Spinks did this.

38:55.129 --> 38:57.791
You know,
he's the one who...

38:57.865 --> 38:59.799
Like I said,
it's a long story.

38:59.867 --> 39:02.267
Where are you going?

39:02.336 --> 39:04.566
To a friend's house.

39:04.638 --> 39:08.506
I have to leave, actually,
as in now.

39:08.576 --> 39:10.976
Are you sure you're all right?
You're not feeling...

39:11.045 --> 39:13.775
Yes, absolutely.
I'm-I'm fine, you know?

39:13.847 --> 39:15.781
It's just that when you came
to see me yesterday,

39:15.849 --> 39:18.647
I sensed that there were things that
you wanted to talk about, but couldn't.

39:18.719 --> 39:21.017
[Closes Drawer]

39:21.088 --> 39:23.022
That was yesterday.

39:25.192 --> 39:27.195
Well, can we talk
about them now?

39:27.328 --> 39:30.695
Look, let me stop you
right there, okay?

39:30.765 --> 39:33.996
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

39:34.068 --> 39:37.196
As of...
As of 10:38 a.m.,

39:37.271 --> 39:40.502
I am no longer employed by
the Lucky Boy Corporation.

39:40.575 --> 39:43.669
- I quit.
- Rob.

39:43.744 --> 39:45.678
I'm here as a friend.

39:45.746 --> 39:48.180
Well, then,
consider me cured.

39:48.249 --> 39:50.240
I had a breakthrough
last night.

39:50.318 --> 39:52.878
- Did you attend the O.A. Meeting?
- Yeah.

39:52.954 --> 39:56.822
- How did it go?
- It was a complete
and utter waste of my time.

39:56.891 --> 39:58.950
I'm sorry
you felt that way.

39:59.026 --> 40:01.017
So they're a bunch
of fat people.

40:01.095 --> 40:04.030
So what?
M-M-Maybe they, got, uh,

40:04.098 --> 40:06.931
what you would call
a biological imperative...

40:07.001 --> 40:09.026
to eat too much.

40:09.103 --> 40:13.039
Did you ever think
of that? Did you?

40:13.107 --> 40:18.568
You know, maybe I've got
a biological imperative too.

40:18.646 --> 40:21.080
So why is that
such a bad thing?

40:21.148 --> 40:25.016
Like, the world's gonna end?
That is biology.

40:25.086 --> 40:28.419
You can't fight biology.
You can't.

40:28.489 --> 40:33.153
- Sounds like you're saying
you're tired of feeling guilty.
- Bingo.

40:33.227 --> 40:35.218
And I am sick and tired...

40:35.296 --> 40:37.526
of pretending that
I'm something that I'm not.

40:41.269 --> 40:43.203
You killed that man,
didn't you?

40:54.515 --> 40:56.449
What did you just say?

40:56.517 --> 40:58.747
That's why you feel
so guilty, isn't it?

41:00.988 --> 41:03.513
Can you tell me why
you did it?

41:03.591 --> 41:07.755
- Who have you been talking to?
- No one.

41:07.828 --> 41:10.194
I realized it
after our last session.

41:10.264 --> 41:13.995
- You spoke to the F.B.I., didn't you?
- I haven't spoken to anyone.

41:14.068 --> 41:16.434
And I won't without your permission,
but I am here...

41:16.504 --> 41:19.439
- to ask you to turn yourself in.
- [Siren Wailing]

41:19.507 --> 41:22.374
I want you to get
the help that you need.

41:22.443 --> 41:24.377
[Siren Continues]

41:31.652 --> 41:34.951
- [Car Doors Opening, Closing]
- You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

41:35.022 --> 41:36.956
Yes, I do, Rob.

41:37.024 --> 41:38.787
No, you don't!

41:41.262 --> 41:43.196
You said...

41:43.264 --> 41:45.528
you don't believe
in monsters.

41:45.599 --> 41:48.466
Right?

41:48.536 --> 41:52.028
How about...

41:52.106 --> 41:54.040
now?

41:55.576 --> 41:58.101
[Gasps]

41:59.213 --> 42:01.147
How about...

42:04.318 --> 42:06.548
now?

42:06.620 --> 42:10.112
Do you believe...
in monsters?

42:18.999 --> 42:21.524
You poor man.

42:23.971 --> 42:25.905
What you must go through.

42:31.345 --> 42:33.279
- [Door Bursts Open]
- [Gasps]

42:37.351 --> 42:39.819
- Oh, my God.
- Step away, Rob.

42:41.622 --> 42:44.056
- Step away.
- Dr. Reinhart, step away from him.

42:44.125 --> 42:47.686
- Don't hurt him.
- Rob, we tracked Sylvia down
on the way to the landfll.

42:47.762 --> 42:50.128
You just can't
stop yourself, can you?

42:51.298 --> 42:53.391
Get on the floor.

42:53.467 --> 42:56.527
Rob, get on the floor!

42:57.872 --> 43:00.568
Rob.

43:00.641 --> 43:03.405
Be that good person
I know you mean to be.

43:33.641 --> 43:35.575
