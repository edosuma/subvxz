00:21.129 --> 00:22.710
Lenny, please.

00:22.929 --> 00:23.800
Don't.

00:24.129 --> 00:27.390
You think I'm not gonna find you
after you humiliate me again?

00:28.329 --> 00:29.870
I didn't do anything.

00:30.129 --> 00:31.460
- I swear, I never--
- No!

00:33.130 --> 00:35.340
I know what you're doing. I see.

00:36.130 --> 00:39.750
The men, the lies.
This is the last time, damn it.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.200
What do you want, baby?

00:44.530 --> 00:46.630
You only get like this when you're--

00:50.530 --> 00:53.020
What are you gonna do?
Pulverize me right here?

00:54.130 --> 00:55.429
Somebody will hear me scream.

00:55.929 --> 00:57.960
In downtown L. A. at night?

01:00.130 --> 01:01.500
Who's gonna hear, Rach?

01:01.929 --> 01:03.820
Nobody who cares.

01:04.930 --> 01:06.010
Besides...

01:06.730 --> 01:08.409
... this will be over fast.

01:09.129 --> 01:10.530
Please...

01:11.530 --> 01:12.650
... no.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.930
I' m sorry.
I just can't take this anymore.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.060
Poor Lenny. Terrorizing your
girlfriend too much for you?

01:21.730 --> 01:22.989
I can make it stop.

01:30.730 --> 01:31.640
Are you all right?

01:34.329 --> 01:35.450
- Is he... ?
- It's okay.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.739
He's not getting up for a while.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.950
I can't believe
you actually showed up.

01:42.129 --> 01:43.670
That was the deal, right?

01:45.129 --> 01:49.450
"How can I thank you, mysterious,
black-clad hunk of a night thing?"

01:49.930 --> 01:54.109
"No need, little lady. Your tears
of gratitude are enough for me.

01:55.329 --> 01:58.519
You see, I was once a bad-ass vampire.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.629
But love and a pesky curse
defanged me.

02:02.530 --> 02:06.569
And now I'm just a big, fluffy puppy
with bad teeth."

02:07.930 --> 02:09.610
"No, not the hair. Never the hair."

02:10.330 --> 02:13.590
"But there must be some way
I can show my appreciation."

02:14.530 --> 02:17.479
"No! Helping those in need's my job.

02:18.129 --> 02:20.620
And working up a load
of sexual tension...

02:21.129 --> 02:23.759
... and prancing away
like a magnificent poof...

02:24.129 --> 02:26.379
... is truly thanks enough."

02:27.129 --> 02:30.150
"I understand.
I have a nephew who's gay, so--"

02:30.729 --> 02:32.870
"Say no more ! Evil's still afoot.

02:33.729 --> 02:36.569
And I'm almost out of that
nancy-boy hair gel I like so much!

02:37.330 --> 02:40.139
Quickly! To the Angel mobile! Away!"

02:46.930 --> 02:48.370
Go on with you.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.930
Play the big, strapping hero
while you can.

02:53.530 --> 02:56.020
You have a few surprises
coming your way.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.110
The ring of Amarra...

02:58.930 --> 03:01.810
... a visit from your old pal Spike...

03:02.530 --> 03:03.789
... and oh, yeah...

03:04.330 --> 03:06.719
... your gruesome, horrible death.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.099
Another 40 minutes
of uninterrupted music,

04:12.250 --> 04:15.090
You're listening to the sounds of
L.A.'s only modern alternative...

04:15.849 --> 04:17.529
...KLA Rock,

04:18.250 --> 04:22.079
It's 11;O5,
Do you know what your karma is?

04:26.050 --> 04:28.649
This is so awesome.
Our first walk-in client.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.769
It's all according to plan.

04:31.449 --> 04:34.779
See girl in distress. See Angel save
girl from druggie-stalker boyfriend.

04:35.649 --> 04:37.259
See boyfriend go to jail.

04:37.449 --> 04:38.500
And see...

04:39.850 --> 04:40.860
...invoice!

04:41.649 --> 04:43.160
Ta-da!

04:47.050 --> 04:48.449
- What?
- Nothing.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.709
You're doing a lovely job.
Very official.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.670
So why not rejoice
at our first paying client?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.810
Because that's not money
in your hand. That's mail.

04:57.850 --> 05:00.310
There's a difference
between that and getting paid.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.410
But she has to pay. Invoice.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.920
That's the rule of our whole society.

05:06.250 --> 05:10.009
Defaulting. Another popular rule.
Especially with the down-and-outs.

05:11.050 --> 05:13.370
Not that I've perpetrated
said heinousness myself--

05:14.050 --> 05:15.730
What are you saying? Why bother?

05:15.850 --> 05:20.029
I'm saying if you and I hope to take
that cruise to the Bahamas together...

05:20.649 --> 05:22.439
...we'll need
a lot more clients of means.

05:23.050 --> 05:25.189
And a reality where
you're Matthew McConaughey.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.029
Hello, L.A.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.709
Oz? Oh, my God!

05:30.250 --> 05:32.500
Oz, I am so happy to see you!

05:33.250 --> 05:34.930
Good old Oz.

05:35.050 --> 05:36.870
Oz. Oz!

05:37.449 --> 05:40.120
Let me just take a stab at this,
but you'd be Oz?

05:41.050 --> 05:42.730
- Good guess.
- This is so cool.

05:43.449 --> 05:45.480
I mean, here you are in L.A...

05:45.850 --> 05:48.240
...and you're the embodiment
of all things Sunnydale.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.019
Well, it's a burden, but I manage.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.829
Okay, we have serious
catching up to do.

05:53.649 --> 05:56.420
- How's everything? How's the Bronze?
- The same.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.879
- And the gang?
- Good.

05:58.449 --> 06:00.199
Good? Good!

06:00.850 --> 06:02.220
Good.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.009
- We done?
- Completely.

06:07.449 --> 06:10.639
Oh, this is Doyle.
He, air-quote, "works here."

06:12.250 --> 06:14.990
I heard the rumors.
You can fill me in on the real deal.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.689
- You guys are detectives?
- No. I'm an actress.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.360
Quite a captivating one at that.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.990
And between my many gigs,
I choose to help Angel.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.720
Yeah, he's the detective.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.560
Does he have a hat and gun?

06:28.449 --> 06:29.319
Just fangs.

06:29.649 --> 06:32.040
Well, that works. Where is he?

06:43.449 --> 06:44.990
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:45.850 --> 06:47.050
- Oz.
- Angel.

06:47.050 --> 06:48.170
- Nice surprise.
- Thanks.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.639
- Staying long?
- A few days.

06:51.850 --> 06:52.899
They always like this?

06:53.050 --> 06:54.490
No, we're usually laconic.

06:54.850 --> 06:56.040
Come on in.

06:57.850 --> 06:58.860
So.

06:59.649 --> 07:01.399
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

07:02.050 --> 07:05.459
I came primarily for a gig,
but also to give you this.

07:08.050 --> 07:10.300
Wait a minute,
is that what I think it is?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.649
It's the Gem of Amarra.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.279
One and the same.

07:19.449 --> 07:20.850
Buffy wanted you to have it.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.300
Hey, Buffy.

07:22.449 --> 07:24.839
- How is good old Buffy, anyway?
- She's--

07:25.449 --> 07:28.189
Still the brave little slayer,
or moping like...

07:30.850 --> 07:32.250
...nobody around here.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.970
She's good.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.300
She's Buffy.

07:38.050 --> 07:42.160
For right now, can we concentrate
on the mother lode Angel just hit?

07:43.449 --> 07:45.060
Why are you waiting? Put it on.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.250
You're getting weird with this ring.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.040
When did you care about accessorizing?

07:50.050 --> 07:51.629
Since the accessory's priceless...

07:52.449 --> 07:55.120
...and renders the wearer unkillable
if he's a vampire.

07:55.449 --> 07:56.500
Unkillable?

07:58.449 --> 07:59.639
Not even stakes?

08:00.250 --> 08:02.209
Not nothing. Not stakes, not fire...

08:02.649 --> 08:04.449
...and best of all, not even sunlight.

08:04.449 --> 08:06.129
Just think of it.
poolside tanning...

08:06.850 --> 08:09.269
...bargain matinees,
plus several strip clubs...

08:09.850 --> 08:12.339
...that have a luncheon buffet
that's quite tasty.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.500
I've heard.

08:14.649 --> 08:16.439
- And it's from Buffy.
- Yeah.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.120
Spike dug up Sunnydale
looking for it...

08:20.050 --> 08:22.079
...but got a fistful of Buffy
and left it.

08:22.449 --> 08:23.610
She wanted it in good hands.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.040
- So she sent you?
- I was heading this way.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.050
She didn't even send a note?

08:28.449 --> 08:29.500
Wow.

08:29.649 --> 08:30.839
That's really--

08:32.649 --> 08:36.019
This is one of those times I should
shy away from the topic, isn't it?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.250
This will boost your spirits.

08:38.649 --> 08:41.950
Put it on, and here, I'll stake you.
It'll be fun!

08:42.850 --> 08:43.720
Maybe later.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.120
- Are you out of your mind?
- I said, later.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.500
Okay, you have it your way, but...

08:51.850 --> 08:54.200
...I'm still going to celebrate
with a drink.

08:54.850 --> 08:57.759
He'd celebrate the opening
of a mailbox with a drink.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.590
- You coming, Oz?
- Yeah, I could eat.

09:01.450 --> 09:02.500
Go ahead.

09:52.929 --> 09:54.470
God.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.330
Know what would feel really good?

09:57.730 --> 09:59.269
One of those mind-numbing...

10:00.129 --> 10:02.590
...head-cracking visions
I get from time to time.

10:03.129 --> 10:05.409
Because that would really kill me.

10:06.129 --> 10:08.019
Is there some kind of trick to this?

10:08.529 --> 10:12.320
The trick is laying off the ale before
you start quoting Angela's Ashes...

10:12.730 --> 10:13.960
...and weeping like a baby.

10:15.129 --> 10:17.159
- That's a good book.
- So I've heard.

10:18.129 --> 10:21.039
But I doubt the main characters
are Betty and Barney Rubble...

10:21.129 --> 10:23.870
...as you so vehemently insisted
last night.

10:24.730 --> 10:28.629
Also, I don't think Oz appreciated
being called "my little Bam Bam."

10:54.730 --> 10:55.740
Hello.

10:56.529 --> 10:57.399
Hello?

10:57.730 --> 10:59.759
- Angel,
- Rachel? Is that you?

11:00.730 --> 11:03.820
They let Lenny out.
The lawyer said something about...

11:04.330 --> 11:05.200
...a technicality,

11:05.529 --> 11:06.899
I'll be right there,

11:16.330 --> 11:17.240
Angel.

11:18.129 --> 11:20.549
You have something I'm looking for.
A shiny bauble.

11:23.529 --> 11:26.480
Might as well go home, Spike.
The Gem of Amarra stays with me.

11:31.929 --> 11:35.019
Why? Because you're
"Angel, Vamp Detective" now?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.970
I'm so scared.

11:37.929 --> 11:39.720
What's next, vampire cowboy?

11:39.730 --> 11:40.639
Vampire fireman?

11:41.529 --> 11:43.179
Oh, vampire ballerina.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.840
I do like to work with my legs.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.730
So, you and I duke it out, huh?

12:03.129 --> 12:04.809
This your strategy to get the ring?

12:05.529 --> 12:06.399
I had a plan.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.409
- You? A plan?
- A good plan.

12:11.529 --> 12:13.740
Smart, carefully laid out.

12:14.529 --> 12:15.470
But I got bored.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.379
All that watching, waiting.

12:21.129 --> 12:23.200
My legs started to cramp.

12:24.730 --> 12:26.870
Enough with this.
Tell me where the ring is!

12:28.330 --> 12:30.610
It wouldn't go with your outfit.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.320
Cordelia.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.090
You look smashing.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.289
- You lose weight?
- Yes.

12:48.730 --> 12:50.759
There's this great gym on--

12:51.129 --> 12:52.139
Hey.

12:53.529 --> 12:54.929
I'll get that ring.

12:55.330 --> 12:58.419
This isn't over until one of us
is a pile of dust.

12:58.929 --> 12:59.870
You okay?

13:00.730 --> 13:03.710
- More importantly, how's the ring?
- It's fine.

13:05.529 --> 13:07.320
I can't say the same
for you two, though.

13:07.929 --> 13:10.179
Better get out of sight.
Spike's out for blood.

13:10.929 --> 13:12.440
Take her to your place.

13:12.730 --> 13:14.690
His place? Why can't I just go home?

13:15.129 --> 13:17.450
Because he knows you.
He can track you down.

13:18.129 --> 13:20.159
He's not invited, right?
He can't come in.

13:20.529 --> 13:22.279
He can burn the place to the ground.

13:22.929 --> 13:24.230
Doyle's place it is.

13:24.730 --> 13:25.740
What about you?

13:25.929 --> 13:27.610
He'll be coming back for you.

13:28.330 --> 13:30.289
- I know.
- So, what will you do?

13:30.730 --> 13:31.919
Find him first.

13:33.129 --> 13:34.809
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

13:43.370 --> 13:44.419
Not Spice,

13:44.570 --> 13:48.500
That's the bird that works down on
Broadway. Spike, as in railroad.

13:49.970 --> 13:51.720
Yeah, vampire. Right.

13:52.370 --> 13:53.419
No.

13:54.169 --> 13:55.570
Okay, then. Thanks.

13:57.769 --> 13:59.490
Frankie Tripod, a big "no."

13:59.570 --> 14:03.220
Frankie Tripod? I get it. Some kind
of three-legged monster, right?

14:04.370 --> 14:05.169
No, he's human.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.460
Then, what's his name supposed to--?
Oh.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.940
Listen, why don't you sit down,
get comfortable?

14:12.769 --> 14:16.419
Angel said to go through every contact
until I find where Spike is hiding.

14:16.970 --> 14:17.950
Could be a while.

14:18.769 --> 14:22.250
I couldn't get comfortable here
if the floor was lined with mink.

14:22.970 --> 14:24.690
How can you live like this?

14:24.769 --> 14:28.600
I didn't until last week. Then I saw
your place and called my decorator.

14:29.570 --> 14:30.230
No way.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.970
My apartment is nowhere near...

14:31.970 --> 14:32.950
...this yucky.

14:36.769 --> 14:38.629
- Smells like bong water in here.
- Okay...

14:39.169 --> 14:42.149
...some laundry may be
a couple of days past due, but--

14:44.570 --> 14:45.340
Yeah.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.139
Hey, Kizzy.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.009
Yeah, a vamp called Spike.

14:49.970 --> 14:50.840
No, huh?

14:51.169 --> 14:52.889
What? A C-note?

14:53.570 --> 14:55.389
No, I absolutely paid that back.

14:55.970 --> 14:58.179
No, sorry.
There goes my other line, got to--

15:00.769 --> 15:03.230
He was mistaken.
But I didn't have time to get into it.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.279
I'm on a mission here.

15:06.769 --> 15:09.230
So, what about this Spike?
Is he as bad as all that?

15:09.769 --> 15:10.929
Should I be sweating?

15:11.570 --> 15:13.570
No, he's not so--

15:16.370 --> 15:17.419
Sweat.

15:19.370 --> 15:20.840
That's what I figured.

15:25.970 --> 15:29.129
Keep showing up like this,
I'll think you're a man of your word.

15:29.570 --> 15:30.690
Stranger things....

15:31.370 --> 15:32.629
Not many.

15:33.169 --> 15:35.799
We'll get you out.
There are places you'll be safe.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.320
- Like a shelter?
- It's a start.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.220
He won't be able to find you, I swear.

15:43.970 --> 15:46.570
No, it's not the shelter.
It's just--

15:49.970 --> 15:53.549
Half the time, you know how this whole
thing starts up, Lenny and me?

15:54.169 --> 15:55.179
You call him.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.340
I just--

15:57.769 --> 15:59.799
I start to jones for him...

16:00.169 --> 16:02.129
...the way he joneses for rock.

16:02.570 --> 16:06.220
And I call or find him in some dive
and drag him home.

16:07.370 --> 16:08.809
And it's good for a while.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.330
But it doesn't last.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.179
This last time
he would have killed you.

16:20.570 --> 16:22.429
I'm scared, Angel.

16:24.169 --> 16:26.590
I'm more scared of me
than I am of him right now.

16:27.169 --> 16:28.750
You're at a crossroads. I know.

16:29.570 --> 16:32.409
It's either go for the easy fix
and wait for the consequences...

16:32.570 --> 16:35.309
...or take the hard road
and go with faith.

16:36.769 --> 16:38.139
Oh, God.

16:38.570 --> 16:41.059
You're not from that freaky church
on Sunset, are you?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.909
In yourself. That kind of faith.

16:46.370 --> 16:48.929
I'm saying, if you leave
Lenny for good, it'll hurt.

16:49.370 --> 16:51.440
But, eventually,
you'll be stronger for it.

16:51.769 --> 16:54.679
And maybe you'll find your way
to the kind of love you deserve.

16:56.570 --> 16:59.269
You mean the kind that comes
without 911 calls?

17:00.169 --> 17:01.889
That's the general idea.

17:03.169 --> 17:04.150
Oh, yeah,

17:05.569 --> 17:08.900
Spike's nearly killed Buffy. I mention
he's killed two slayers already?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.079
You did.

17:10.368 --> 17:12.400
And one time he and Dru
raised a demon...

17:13.368 --> 17:15.400
...that burned people alive
from the inside.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.299
It was this whole weird thing
with an arm in a box.

17:18.769 --> 17:19.960
An arm in a box?

17:23.569 --> 17:25.180
- House of Pies.
- Doyle?

17:25.970 --> 17:26.880
Is that you?

17:27.170 --> 17:29.559
Just laying low,
the calls to past acquaintances...

17:30.170 --> 17:31.779
...stirred up a few resentments.

17:32.569 --> 17:33.759
I hope it was worth it,

17:33.769 --> 17:37.250
Manny The Pig said he didn't know
about a vampire called Spike,

17:37.970 --> 17:39.049
- So?
- He said that...

17:39.769 --> 17:41.940
...before I mentioned
anything about Spike.

17:42.170 --> 17:45.220
So you'll find him at a joint
on 3rd called the Orbit Room,

17:46.369 --> 17:48.230
Okay. I'll start with Manny The Pig.

17:48.769 --> 17:50.210
Work your way down,

17:52.650 --> 17:54.190
He left for the club!

17:58.049 --> 17:59.309
Try the game.

18:07.049 --> 18:08.099
Put them down.

18:08.849 --> 18:10.180
He'll kill me if I talk.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.039
How healthy do you think it is
to stay quiet?

18:13.650 --> 18:15.049
He's out back.

18:28.049 --> 18:29.309
Let her go.

18:31.049 --> 18:33.890
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a hell of a buzz-kill?

18:35.849 --> 18:36.720
Run!

18:43.049 --> 18:45.259
Caught me fair and square, white hat.

18:47.849 --> 18:50.829
Guess there's nothing to do now
but go along quietly...

18:51.450 --> 18:53.660
...and pay my debt to society.

18:53.849 --> 18:56.380
You think you can come to my town
and pull this crap?

18:57.450 --> 18:58.750
You never learn, Spike.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.829
I may be a slow learner, but...

19:06.450 --> 19:07.890
...eventually I catch on.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.339
Angel should have called by now.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.859
This is bad.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.619
Maybe not.

19:27.049 --> 19:30.599
Maybe he did away with Spike in short
order and decided to try surfing.

19:31.849 --> 19:35.079
Right. What am I worried about?
Angel has the ring.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.490
- Right?
- Absolutely.

19:37.849 --> 19:40.869
I bet he's hanging 10 off the sandy
shores of Malibu right now.

19:41.450 --> 19:44.640
Wind in his hair,
bikini babes a-whistling,

19:57.650 --> 19:59.509
Marcus is an expert.

20:00.049 --> 20:03.420
Some say "artist" but I've never
been comfortable with labels.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.779
He's a bloody king of torture, he is.

20:07.849 --> 20:09.460
Humans, demons...

20:10.849 --> 20:13.059
...politicians, makes no difference.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.740
Some say he invented
several of the classics...

20:16.250 --> 20:18.710
...but he won't tell me which ones.

20:21.650 --> 20:25.230
Beneath the cool exterior,
you'll find he's rather shy.

20:27.049 --> 20:28.660
Except with kids.

20:30.049 --> 20:32.720
You like kids, don't you, Marcus?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.369
Well, likes to eat.

20:36.650 --> 20:38.230
And other nasty things.

20:46.849 --> 20:47.829
His skin.

20:48.049 --> 20:49.700
Annoying, isn't it? Still attached.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.819
Over 200 years of living
and so little external damage.

20:55.849 --> 20:57.460
What about internal?

20:57.650 --> 21:00.599
Do you two need to be alone
or can we get on with it?

21:01.250 --> 21:02.329
He's known love.

21:03.049 --> 21:05.440
And with a slayer no less.
How's that for perversion?

21:06.049 --> 21:07.910
And he has a soul.

21:08.450 --> 21:12.450
Right, a vampire with a soul cursed
to walk the earth, trying to do good.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.509
That's not a problem, is it?

21:15.049 --> 21:18.000
On the contrary. Creatures with souls
have something to lose.

21:18.650 --> 21:21.109
Souls, fingers, toes,
let's get chopping, shall we?

21:21.650 --> 21:23.089
I want my damn ring.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.240
What do you want, Angel?

21:26.450 --> 21:29.049
Are you gonna torture me
or just bore me to death?

21:38.450 --> 21:40.309
Probably a little of both.

21:40.849 --> 21:42.990
Someone's having shish kebab.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.900
What do you want?

21:46.250 --> 21:47.690
What do you want, Angel?

21:48.049 --> 21:50.859
House in the country.
Running shoes you can wear to dinner.

21:51.650 --> 21:53.299
Why do you keep asking that?

21:53.450 --> 21:55.309
And why do you keep playing Brahms?

21:55.849 --> 21:59.329
Actually it's Mozart. Symphony 41.
I find it very effective.

22:00.049 --> 22:02.470
Personally, I like his
older, funnier symphonies.

22:03.049 --> 22:04.589
Look, I want my ring!

22:04.849 --> 22:06.990
And if I don't get it pretty soon...

22:09.650 --> 22:11.470
...I'll stake him right here and now!

22:12.049 --> 22:14.609
He knows you won't kill him
until you get the ring.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.240
He knows you're lying.

22:18.049 --> 22:19.839
Then you get it for me.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.880
Soon he'll tell me everything
and then some.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.789
And he knows I'm not lying.

22:29.450 --> 22:30.710
I believe he does.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.759
- You're an idiot.
- You think?

22:33.049 --> 22:35.819
Because I'm not the one
with the hot pokers in my side.

22:36.650 --> 22:38.329
You hired a vampire.

22:39.049 --> 22:42.099
What do you think he'll do with it
when he finds it? Hand it to you?

22:43.250 --> 22:46.940
Oh, good lord, why didn't I think--?
Oh, half a mo. I did.

22:47.450 --> 22:51.210
I hired a guy who doesn't care
about the ring or anything else...

22:51.650 --> 22:54.490
...except taking blokes apart
one piece at a time.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.480
It's called addiction.

22:57.049 --> 22:58.589
We all have them.

22:59.450 --> 23:02.430
I believe yours is named
Slutty the Vampire Slayer.

23:04.849 --> 23:05.900
Thank you.

23:09.049 --> 23:10.250
Speaking of little Buff...

23:10.250 --> 23:12.849
...I ran into her recently.
Your name didn't come up.

23:13.849 --> 23:15.670
Although she has been awful busy...

23:16.250 --> 23:19.019
...jumping the bones of the first
lunkhead who came along.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.809
Good-looking fellow.
Used her shamelessly.

23:23.450 --> 23:26.470
She is cute when she's hurting,
isn't she?

23:27.049 --> 23:29.369
She's cuter when she's
kicking your ass.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.299
I think I'll get some fresh air,
leave you two kids to it.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.789
Now that's music.

24:00.049 --> 24:01.589
If I was a ring...

24:01.849 --> 24:03.250
...where would I be?

24:23.450 --> 24:25.130
Well, this is fun...

24:25.250 --> 24:27.569
...but it's gonna get old real fast.

24:33.049 --> 24:34.910
Most things that live and breathe...

24:35.450 --> 24:38.220
...hate the dark and love the light.

24:46.849 --> 24:48.599
We're different though, aren't we?

24:49.250 --> 24:51.920
We hate the light of day
and it hates us back in kind.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.339
You hid the ring, Angel.

24:58.849 --> 25:02.109
You could be walking in the light
right now. So I have to wonder...

25:03.049 --> 25:05.440
...what do you want if not the ring?

25:06.650 --> 25:09.490
It's through the pain that we find
the truth of who we are.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.069
It strips us of our defenses.

25:12.650 --> 25:15.109
We are made innocent again,
like children.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.829
I like children, Angel.

25:18.049 --> 25:20.400
I'm here to help you
find that innocence...

25:21.049 --> 25:22.279
...here...

25:22.849 --> 25:24.289
...with the light.

25:28.730 --> 25:31.430
When you're through giving the place
the Johnny Depp-over...

25:31.730 --> 25:33.410
...I hope you have the cash
to pay for all this.

25:34.130 --> 25:35.180
Cordelia.

25:35.329 --> 25:37.680
- Love the hair.
- Wish I could say the same to you.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.630
That's close enough, dimwit.

25:41.329 --> 25:43.750
What is it with you good guys
running in packs?

25:44.329 --> 25:46.400
- Who's this one?
- More than meets the eye.

25:46.730 --> 25:49.150
The mick's got spine.

25:49.730 --> 25:51.269
Maybe I'll snap it in two.

25:51.529 --> 25:53.390
Do you want me to use this?

25:54.529 --> 25:56.809
You'll be dead
before the arrow leaves the bow.

25:59.329 --> 26:00.660
Now where was I?

26:01.130 --> 26:04.109
Tired of looking for that ring.
You two should take over.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.960
Where's Angel?

26:07.730 --> 26:09.829
Tall, brooding guy? Caveman brow?

26:10.130 --> 26:12.380
He's having the hell
tortured out of him.

26:13.130 --> 26:14.529
You know how stubborn he is.

26:15.529 --> 26:17.210
He might die
before he gives up the ring.

26:17.329 --> 26:19.960
Why don't you two find it real fast
and give it to me.

26:20.930 --> 26:22.009
I'll let Angel go.

26:23.329 --> 26:24.200
I don't trust you.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.740
To coin a popular Sunnydale phrase,
"Duh."

26:26.930 --> 26:28.609
But you do have until sundown.

26:29.329 --> 26:32.809
I'll be behind Peterson's Fishery,
between Seward and Westminster.

26:33.529 --> 26:34.720
Don't be late.

26:36.529 --> 26:39.509
You did terrible things
when you were bad, didn't you?

26:40.130 --> 26:43.079
And now you're trying so hard
to do good.

26:43.730 --> 26:44.670
But Angel...

26:45.529 --> 26:47.250
...there's nothing bad or good...

26:47.329 --> 26:48.869
...but thinking makes it so.

26:53.930 --> 26:55.960
Now, I can make the pain go away...

26:59.329 --> 27:01.609
...and, as you know,
I can bring it bank again.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.670
What do you want, Angel?

27:12.529 --> 27:15.019
I think I know,
but I'd like to hear it from you.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.210
The truth.

27:17.329 --> 27:19.049
I'll know if you're lying.

27:25.730 --> 27:26.890
I want...

27:30.529 --> 27:31.900
...forgiveness.

27:32.329 --> 27:33.240
Yes.

27:33.529 --> 27:34.690
That's the truth.

27:35.329 --> 27:36.589
And you want to earn it.

27:37.130 --> 27:39.160
You don't take the easy way out.

27:39.529 --> 27:41.599
Which is why I like you so much.

27:41.930 --> 27:43.230
In the end...

27:43.730 --> 27:46.640
...you won't feel guilt or remorse...

27:47.329 --> 27:49.500
...or anything but pure darkness.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.859
In the end, the ring, the past...

27:53.329 --> 27:55.500
... none of it will mean anything
anymore.

27:56.329 --> 27:57.730
You'll be free.

27:58.130 --> 27:59.289
I promise.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.470
And I promise...

28:02.329 --> 28:03.269
...to kill you.

28:04.130 --> 28:05.460
Staking the torturer...

28:05.930 --> 28:07.720
...is strictly prohibited.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.329
Easy, big fella.
Still need that ring.

28:13.730 --> 28:16.609
Now you've made him mad.
Wouldn't want to be in your chains.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.630
It won't be long now.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.779
Well, what say I grab a pair of
needlenose pliers and give a hand?

28:27.769 --> 28:29.309
- Drat.
- What?

28:30.170 --> 28:32.099
It's not in the freezer or the toilet.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.710
In the movies,
it's always in one of those.

28:34.970 --> 28:36.160
- It's not here.
- No.

28:36.769 --> 28:37.890
We looked everywhere.

28:38.569 --> 28:40.529
- Except?
- The rat-infested tunnels...

28:40.970 --> 28:43.140
...he uses to get around
in the daytime.

28:45.769 --> 28:47.769
This is not a needle in a haystack.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.609
This is a needle in Kansas.

28:49.970 --> 28:51.410
I know, you're right.

28:52.369 --> 28:54.119
We just gotta keep looking.

29:20.569 --> 29:21.900
Here!

29:23.569 --> 29:24.759
How did you do that?

29:25.369 --> 29:27.859
- You gotta get lucky sometimes.
- I could hug you!

29:28.369 --> 29:30.720
Not that lucky.
Come on, we gotta save Angel.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.759
By giving Spike
what he wants so he can kill us.

29:34.369 --> 29:37.180
Right. No. We need a plan.

29:42.170 --> 29:43.849
So where's my ring?

29:44.569 --> 29:46.500
- Not on us.
- But we know where it is.

29:46.970 --> 29:49.849
And suddenly I'm so painfully bored.

29:50.569 --> 29:52.430
Time runs short, children.

29:52.970 --> 29:55.460
Give me that ring
as if Angel's life depended on it.

29:55.970 --> 29:58.640
Listen, you little Cockney,
take us to Angel, now.

29:59.569 --> 30:01.150
Show us he's still in one piece...

30:01.369 --> 30:03.329
...we'll tell you
where to find your ring.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.049
He's still alive, I think.

30:06.769 --> 30:09.369
"In one piece" was never
a part of the deal.

30:12.170 --> 30:13.750
Lucy, I'm home!

30:14.569 --> 30:15.369
- Angel!
- Hey. Hey.

30:15.769 --> 30:17.240
A deal's a deal.

30:17.569 --> 30:18.829
Cordelia.

30:19.369 --> 30:20.980
Our deal was for the ring. So...

30:21.170 --> 30:23.589
...you've wasted enough
of my time, I'd like it...

30:24.170 --> 30:25.500
...now!

30:25.970 --> 30:28.289
You want the ring, you dog?

30:30.170 --> 30:31.329
Fetch!

30:33.769 --> 30:36.819
Okay. Good.
You've got the ring, we've got Angel.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.690
Now you'll leave us alone
and we'll leave.

30:40.970 --> 30:44.019
Come on. You don't really think
we're gonna do that, do you?

30:45.769 --> 30:46.640
- Not really.
- No.

30:53.569 --> 30:54.339
Spike.

31:13.369 --> 31:14.880
Where's the ring?

31:20.569 --> 31:22.180
Bloody hell.

31:41.450 --> 31:43.450
Son of a bitch!

31:46.250 --> 31:48.069
I do the work...

31:48.650 --> 31:50.049
...I do the digging...

31:50.450 --> 31:51.710
...fight off a slayer...

31:52.250 --> 31:54.210
...drive to L.A...

31:54.650 --> 31:55.730
...hire the help...

31:56.450 --> 31:57.990
...and what do I get?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.920
Royally screwed is what!

32:03.049 --> 32:05.819
Well, that cinches it.
No more partners.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.930
From now on, I'm my own man.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.900
Lone wolf.

32:12.650 --> 32:14.329
Sole survivor.

32:15.049 --> 32:16.630
Look out!

32:16.849 --> 32:21.130
Here comes Spike,
the biggest, baddest mother--

32:30.650 --> 32:32.470
I really hope they kill each other.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.009
- How is he?
- He'll live.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.519
He needs a hospital.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.660
Which one?
They all specialize in humans.

33:01.809 --> 33:03.140
He's right. Too risky.

33:03.609 --> 33:04.690
Know any first aid?

33:05.410 --> 33:07.829
Your basic 6th grade,
but I can improvise.

33:08.410 --> 33:10.480
- If we find someplace dark--
- Turn around.

33:11.410 --> 33:13.200
- He's delirious, ignore him.
- Turn around.

33:13.210 --> 33:15.240
Why? It's daylight
and you're ringless.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.559
Unless you change the act
to human torch, no.

33:18.609 --> 33:20.359
She's right. You're death on toast.

33:21.009 --> 33:22.690
No shape to fight a torture demon.

33:23.410 --> 33:24.710
God!

33:25.210 --> 33:27.029
Okay, he's got a thing for children.

33:28.210 --> 33:30.630
Oz, turn around.
He can't have gone far.

33:39.009 --> 33:41.259
Hello, boys and girls.

33:55.809 --> 33:59.039
Run. Move your little scout legs.
Now! Go!

34:02.410 --> 34:03.460
Damn it, I'll get him.

34:08.409 --> 34:09.139
Doyle!

34:09.610 --> 34:11.190
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.

34:27.010 --> 34:27.949
Where is he?

34:51.809 --> 34:54.719
- Are you planning to kill me?
- Well, after all, I promised.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.599
You never cracked me.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.440
You tried, but you failed.

35:17.010 --> 35:18.940
Now that's gotta be torture.

35:56.610 --> 35:59.349
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'm--

36:00.210 --> 36:01.329
Thanks for the help.

36:02.610 --> 36:03.659
You were key.

36:03.809 --> 36:04.719
You're...

36:05.010 --> 36:06.800
...incredibly pale.

36:09.809 --> 36:12.789
Look, you should lie down.
We should take you home.

36:14.610 --> 36:16.190
Just give him a minute.

36:32.610 --> 36:34.329
He's very pale.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.360
Paler than most people.

36:54.570 --> 36:56.710
So, how long has it been
between sunsets?

36:58.170 --> 36:59.960
Two hundred years, give or take.

37:00.570 --> 37:03.099
You gotta be feeling
damn good then. This ring...

37:04.170 --> 37:05.849
...changes everything, don't it?

37:11.969 --> 37:15.730
It's spectacular, but I promise there
will be another one again tomorrow.

37:16.769 --> 37:18.170
Not for me.

37:19.170 --> 37:22.719
What are you saying? The city will
get hit by a meteor before tomorrow?

37:23.369 --> 37:27.059
No, it's too horrible to say.
I can't bring myself to say the other.

37:27.570 --> 37:28.829
I'm not gonna wear the ring.

37:29.369 --> 37:30.599
That was the other.

37:34.170 --> 37:37.429
You got an addiction to the brooding
part of life. Anyone tell you that?

37:38.969 --> 37:40.619
Once or twice.

37:41.369 --> 37:42.630
Care to explain?

37:43.170 --> 37:45.340
This ring is redemption.
What you're waiting for.

37:46.170 --> 37:48.699
No, it just looks like it.

37:49.769 --> 37:51.940
- Think what you're saying.
- I have.

37:53.369 --> 37:57.690
I've thought of it from every angle,
and I figure I did a lot of damage.

37:58.769 --> 38:00.210
More than you can imagine.

38:02.969 --> 38:06.059
You don't get it because your period
of self-flagellation isn't over?

38:06.570 --> 38:08.920
Think of all
the daytime people you could help.

38:09.570 --> 38:10.969
They have help.

38:11.969 --> 38:14.070
The whole world is designed for them.

38:14.369 --> 38:17.070
So much that they have no idea
what goes on after dark.

38:19.170 --> 38:21.559
They don't see the weak ones
lost in the night...

38:22.170 --> 38:23.920
...or the things that prey on them.

38:26.369 --> 38:28.050
And if I join them...

38:28.769 --> 38:30.449
...maybe I'd stop seeing too.

38:33.570 --> 38:36.059
And who'd look out
for all the insomniacs?

38:37.170 --> 38:38.960
I was brought back for a reason.

38:38.969 --> 38:42.019
And I don't think it was
for 18 holes at Rancho.

39:20.369 --> 39:22.900
That Rachel girl
with the crazy boyfriend called...

39:23.369 --> 39:26.530
...and said to say thanks
and that she found a little faith.

39:26.969 --> 39:28.760
Said you'd know what that means.

39:29.969 --> 39:32.429
I don't know about you,
but I had a nice day.

39:35.969 --> 39:39.090
Except for the bulk of it
where I was nearly tortured to death.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.039
You stood up.

39:41.369 --> 39:43.900
Oh, God. I was this close
to telling him everything.

39:44.369 --> 39:47.280
One more hot poker
and I was giving him the ring...

39:47.969 --> 39:50.530
...your mom, everything.

39:51.570 --> 39:53.010
How is your mom?

39:54.305 --> 40:00.544
