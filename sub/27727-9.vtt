All that...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.280
All that is to come.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.320
But first, Aston Martin has
just launched a new car.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.040
And here's Richard Hammond
to tell us all about it.

RICHARD:
This is the new V8 Vantage.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.560
And, well,
it's not an ugly car, is it?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.560
I mean, I'm not sure
about this colour.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.280
You'd be on the phone
to your doctor if your wee
came out like this.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.880
But the shape itself
is stunning.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.080
This is one of those
superstar cars

02:52.120 --> 02:55.360
that leave a wake
of dropped jaws

02:55.400 --> 02:57.000
and phone camera flashes.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.400
(ENGINE REVS)

03:00.240 --> 03:02.240
And as the smallest,
punchiest,

03:02.280 --> 03:04.600
sportiest car in
the Aston line-up,

03:04.640 --> 03:06.040
it's fast too.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.200
0-60 takes
three-and-a-half seconds.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.840
So you're not gonna be
embarrassed by 911 Carreras.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.320
Top speed, 195.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.160
But here's the thing.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.800
Astons have always been
beautiful and fast

03:29.840 --> 03:31.400
in a straight line,

03:31.440 --> 03:33.120
but when you're
making a sports car,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
that's the easy part.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.880
It was when you dug
deeper under the skin,

03:37.920 --> 03:39.920
into the areas
you couldn't see,

03:39.960 --> 03:42.560
that in the past
they often came up short.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.840
The trouble is, the company
has never had the money

03:46.880 --> 03:49.720
or the manpower
of Porsche or Ferrari,

03:49.760 --> 03:52.040
and you could sense that
in their cars.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.080
They just didn't feel
as well made

03:58.120 --> 04:00.120
or well-engineered
as some rivals.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.800
That means
they sold mainly to people

04:04.840 --> 04:08.440
listening to their hearts
and not their heads,

04:08.480 --> 04:11.440
because your heart says,
"I want an Aston"

04:11.480 --> 04:13.480
even when your head says,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.440
"That door doesn't fit
properly."

04:16.840 --> 04:18.840
But this is 2018.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.880
Good looks and speed aren't
enough if bits are coming off
in your hand.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.560
This car can't be nice
to drive, "for an Aston".

04:27.600 --> 04:30.080
It can't be well made,
"for an Aston".

04:30.120 --> 04:32.480
It's got to be good,
full stop.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.720
So, let's start
with the interior,

04:38.440 --> 04:41.080
a place that normally
tells you straightaway

04:41.120 --> 04:43.640
if corners have been cut.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.640
And the news in here is good.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.720
Everything you see
is brand new,

04:48.760 --> 04:51.640
not warmed-up leftovers
from an older model.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.520
And it all feels
properly put together...

04:54.560 --> 05:00.320
as it should in a car
that costs Â£121,000.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.120
And if you push down on
the electric height adjustor,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.000
it has the lowest
driving position

05:06.040 --> 05:08.240
of any car I've ever been in.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.800
I mean, I wouldn't claim
to be a tall man, but...

05:11.880 --> 05:13.880
...this is low.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.520
I feel seven.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.720
Then we come to the engine.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.360
It's a four-litre V8.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.480
It has twin turbos.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.720
It makes 510 horsepower,
and...

05:27.800 --> 05:29.560
...it's German.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.360
Specifically from the AMG
division of Mercedes.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.400
Yes, this will make people
of a Brexity persuasion
choke on their real ale,

05:37.440 --> 05:39.440
but look at it this way.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.600
Why waste money
you don't have

05:41.640 --> 05:43.600
developing an OK engine,

05:43.640 --> 05:46.560
when you can buy in
a brilliant one?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.120
Besides, there's a plaque
here that says, look,

05:49.160 --> 05:53.160
it's been inspected by
somebody at Aston Martin.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.480
Presumably to make sure those
slapdash German engineers

05:56.520 --> 05:58.440
have done things properly.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.200
But although the Vantage
has Mercedes lungs,

06:05.240 --> 06:07.160
the engineers
have tried to make sure

06:07.200 --> 06:09.120
it sings with an Aston voice.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.040
(ENGINE ROARS)

06:14.080 --> 06:16.960
Yeah, in an AMG, this engine
doesn't make this noise.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
In a Merc,
it's all oom-pah bass.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.520
Whereas Aston Martin
have added

06:20.560 --> 06:22.640
some British gravel
to the mix.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.560

(ENGINE RUMBLES)

06:27.640 --> 06:28.560
Rrrr!

06:32.840 --> 06:38.040
So, it's handsome, quick,
tuneful and feels well built.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.320
But now we come
to the acid test -

06:40.360 --> 06:42.760
how the new Vantage
handles corners.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.640
And, on paper at least,
things seem promising.

the one under the DB11.

And it's the first
Aston Martin

06:55.840 --> 06:58.560
to be fitted with
an electronic diff,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.120
a very expensive but very
valuable weapon of war.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.240
So, let's see what's what.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.960
(ENGINE REVS, TYRES SCREECH)

07:16.640 --> 07:17.640
Yeah, it works.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.320
(TYRES SCREECH)

07:26.360 --> 07:29.480
This is in control
of its power. It really is.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.480
It's been set up
by a man who used to work

07:34.520 --> 07:36.600
at suspension masters Lotus.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.800
And you can tell.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.160
This just feels fabulous.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

07:52.400 --> 07:53.840
This knows
what it wants to be.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.760
There's no soft GT mode
like you get in the DB11.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.600
Your entry level setting
is Sport,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.120
and then it goes
Sport Plus and Track.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.600
That's what I want,
it's a sports car!
I don't want a soggy setting.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.120
Yeah, this is superb.

08:21.440 --> 08:25.360
Of course, it's still a car
from a small British company,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.080
so there are a few issues.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.800
Visibility is not brilliant.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.760
For me, sitting down here,
it's like trying

08:32.800 --> 08:34.880
to drive a car from
the back of a crowded lift.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
There's no glove box.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.880
I don't like the sound
of the indicators.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.160
It's like a 1980s
Casio keyboard. Listen.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.760
(THUD OF INDICATOR CLICKING)

08:45.760 --> 08:48.640
And there's too much
Alcantara. This will be
all right when it's new,

08:48.720 --> 08:50.440
but buy one of these
second-hand,

08:50.480 --> 08:52.880
and it'll be like using
somebody else's flannel.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.840
Still, in the big scheme
of things,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.760
these are just niggles.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.760
Because overall,
the Vantage is fantastic fun.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.160
In the past, you could buy
an Aston and love it,

09:12.200 --> 09:15.640
but still know deep down
that a 911 was a better car.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.080
With this new Vantage,
that gap has been closed

09:20.120 --> 09:22.040
to a point where
it doesn't matter.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.760
It's not just brilliant
"for an Aston Martin".

09:29.640 --> 09:31.600
It's brilliant, full stop.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.960
(APPLAUSE)

09:44.480 --> 09:45.840
Good car.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.360
It is a good car.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.040
-I can see out.
-Can you? Can you really?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.880
Amazing, I know.
I really can see out.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.760
I agree with you, it is
a brilliant, brilliant car.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.000
But one thing
I ought to mention -

09:57.040 --> 09:58.880
you know all that tech
inside it?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.280
That is Mercedes stuff,

10:00.320 --> 10:03.440
but it's last-generation
Mercedes stuff
they're fitting.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.080
But it's still better
than all the stuff
that Aston used to fit.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.120
That's true.
No, that is true.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.640
And the other thing, you
expressed surprise that
it's got that AMG engine.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.040
But remember, the Aston V12,
they've been using for years,
that's German.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.840
-It's made in Germany.
-Yes.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.720
That makes it sort of German,
doesn't it?

10:18.760 --> 10:21.880
No, no, no. It's where it's
designed and developed
that matters.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.000
-No, he has got a point.
-Yeah, I mean...

10:24.040 --> 10:26.720
your autobiography, you could
get it printed in Germany

10:26.760 --> 10:31.440
but it would still be dreary
because you designed
and conceived it.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.600
It's...

10:32.640 --> 10:34.640
Can't argue with that, May,
it would be.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.200
Let's not get bogged down
with what's German,
and what's not.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.640
The point is, OK,
unlike the previous Vantage,

10:41.720 --> 10:44.600
that is way, way more
than a pretty face.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.880
I mean, a lot more.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.240
But, now, let's find how fast

10:48.280 --> 10:51.040
Abbie can get one
around the Eboladrome.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.200
(ENGINE REVS)

10:54.240 --> 10:55.600
JEREMY: And away it goes,

10:55.640 --> 10:57.000
with a little bit
of wheel spin

10:57.040 --> 10:59.200
and a wiggle of the hips
under power,

10:59.240 --> 11:00.960
but Abbie's got it
under control,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.520
hammering onto the Isn't.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.960
Working away there at that
unusual and frankly stupid

11:08.000 --> 11:10.680
square steering wheel.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.400
And already we're at the drop
down into Your Name Here.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.200
Was that a four-wheel drift?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.920
And another one!

11:17.960 --> 11:20.520
And now hard braking...

11:20.560 --> 11:22.560
Ooh, look at that,
turns in well.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.440
And that looks quick.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.720
Seems a bit lively there as
all that turbocharged torque

11:29.760 --> 11:31.280
tries to kick the tail out.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.440
If this run was at night,
she'd be in trouble

11:33.480 --> 11:36.080
because the Vantage's
headlamps are woeful!

11:36.120 --> 11:39.560
But no complaints about
the speed, that's for sure.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.960
OK. Oh, coming in wide
for Old Lady's House.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.760
But keeping it neat
round there,

11:48.800 --> 11:52.000
and now the short squirt
down to Substation.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.440
Floaty under braking.
Flicks it in.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.480
Just Field of Sheep to go.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.080
Surprisingly un-slidy
and across the line!

12:04.120 --> 12:06.120
-Oh, there we go.
-Looks exciting.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.160
-It does.
-That was lively.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.880
Like an old-fashioned
racing car, moving around.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.520
-The old days.
-That was a good-looking lap,
that.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.000
Let's find out where
it ended up on our lap board.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.440
Shall we? Here we go.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.520
Aye, aye...ooh.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.440
Exactly the same speed
as a 911 GT3 RS.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.800
When you think the Aston
doesn't have a massive wing

12:27.840 --> 12:30.760
and scaffolding in the back,
that is pretty impressive.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.840
-It is very impressive.
-But never mind that.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.520
It's no faster
than a BMW M5.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.040
Yes, but I think
what that says, James,

12:38.080 --> 12:40.320
is the M5 is
seriously quick.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.720
-Well, quite.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.720
You do forget
just how fast that thing is.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.360
It is, it certainly is.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.640

a four-pack of chat...

They've come up with a new,
a one-off, racing car.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.360
All electric, uh...
all-wheel drive.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.200
It's called the IDR, I've
got a picture of it here.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.200
Now, what interests me
about it is that

13:18.240 --> 13:21.600
there's a claim
that it generates
so much cornering force,

13:21.640 --> 13:24.440
it can cause the driver
to black out.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
Is... Is that a good idea?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.960
A car that renders
its driver unconscious?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.240
I just don't believe it.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.360
I know Kimi Raikkonen
goes unconscious,

13:33.400 --> 13:36.520
but that's normally after
the race in the hotel bar.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.680
Yeah, that doesn't count.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.200
That is Kimi's problem.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.800
The other problem
with that is,

13:40.840 --> 13:43.360
it's not lateral G that makes
you go unconscious, is it?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.640
That's G from side to side,
that's not really the issue.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.520
Lateral G
is what you get in a car

13:47.560 --> 13:49.760
and it's where the blood
goes from side to side.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.800
It's only got that...
And I'm wide,
but it only goes that far.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.840
So in your head you've got
one bit a bit drowsy
and black-outy,

13:55.880 --> 13:58.160
but the other side of your head,
when going round a corner,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.200
is really alert
cos it's full of blood.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.480
No, it's more interesting -
different sides of your head
do different things.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.440
Go that way, and you'd be:
"I want to be really precise,
and do science,"

14:06.480 --> 14:08.240
go this way,
you'd be all creative:

14:08.280 --> 14:11.680
"I just want to paint..."
Algebra...
"I just want to sing."

14:11.720 --> 14:13.320
(LAUGHTER)

14:13.360 --> 14:15.240
When motor racing
commentators talk about,

14:15.280 --> 14:17.000
"That car's got 5G going
through that corner,"

14:17.040 --> 14:18.800
you think,
"But it's five lateral G."

14:18.840 --> 14:21.400
-Yes, exactly.
-It's not the same 5G
you get in a fighter plane

14:21.440 --> 14:24.640
when the blood's going
effectively from
the top of your head

14:24.680 --> 14:27.200
down to the bottom
of your feet, which is
a very long way,

14:27.240 --> 14:29.680
so your head empties and
that's when you do black out.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.000
JAMES: Yes, exactly.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.280
And it used to be alleged
that Douglas Bader

14:33.320 --> 14:35.320
could pull tighter turns
in his Hurricane

14:35.360 --> 14:38.000
than other pilots because
he didn't have any legs

14:38.040 --> 14:40.520
so the blood couldn't go into
them, it stayed in his body.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.160
-I didn't know that.
-Apparently so.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.520
Didn't that mean
he'd just get a big stiffy?

14:44.560 --> 14:46.000
-Well...
-(LAUGHTER)

14:46.040 --> 14:47.480
Because all his, all this...

14:47.520 --> 14:49.960
It's science,
that is medical science!

14:50.000 --> 14:51.360
JAMES: He's right.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.360
-All his blood went there.
-It did.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.000
He was known during
the Battle of Britain
as Douglas Boner.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.440
(LAUGHTER)

15:00.480 --> 15:02.680
"My joystick's broke!
Oh, I've got the wrong one."

15:02.720 --> 15:04.960
"Ooh, I love a dogfight,
a nice..."

15:06.040 --> 15:07.840
We... We can move on.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.360
Now, you might be wondering
why we haven't featured

15:10.400 --> 15:14.440
the Rolls-Royce Cullinan,
their new sort of super
luxury SUV, on this series.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.400
And that's because
Rolls-Royce did express

15:16.440 --> 15:18.720
some reservations
about lending us one

15:18.760 --> 15:23.880
because they said
they were worried
we might say it was ugly.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.040
-Why would they think that?
-Because they've seen it?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.680
(LAUGHTER)

15:28.720 --> 15:32.320
We've actually got a picture
of the Cullinan here.
There it is.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.800
JAMES: Yeah.
RICHARD: (GAGS) Oh, sorry.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.520
JEREMY:
It's a very interesting car.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.800
And I don't doubt
that it's exquisite
to drive and to sit in.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
But it is disgusting
to look at, isn't it?

15:41.880 --> 15:45.120
-That's the main thing.
-I've been thinking about
this, OK?

15:45.160 --> 15:46.920
You might want to drive one,
or own one.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.480
But you're gonna have to
come out of your house

15:48.520 --> 15:50.240
and walk up to it
and see it.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.680
So I was wondering, could you
dig a tunnel, if you had one,

15:53.720 --> 15:56.800
from your cellar, and then
that emerges underneath it?

15:56.840 --> 15:59.240
-Then you wouldn't have to
look at it.
-Exactly.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.040
You'd have to cut a hole
in the bottom of your
Rolls-Royce to get in

16:02.080 --> 16:03.280
and nobody's gonna do that.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.520
What if you fitted
the Cullinan with...

16:05.560 --> 16:09.440
you know that magic glass
that is clear when you look
through it at right angles,

16:09.480 --> 16:11.400
but if you look through it
at any other angle,

16:11.440 --> 16:13.240
it's sort of frosted
so you can't...

16:13.280 --> 16:14.960
-That won't work.
-How do you know?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.800
Because I've got that - and
I genuinely have got that -

16:17.840 --> 16:19.800
in the bathroom
in my flat in London.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.720
-Right.
-Now, for six years I've been
taking showers by the window.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.520
(LAUGHTER)

16:26.560 --> 16:29.520
Cleaning my gentleman's area
very thoroughly,

16:30.600 --> 16:32.400
and sometimes quite quickly.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.600
And...

16:39.040 --> 16:41.200
I'm actually
not making this up.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.240
The floor is six storeys
down, the pavement.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.040
You go,
"Well, I can't see that,

16:45.080 --> 16:47.280
so nobody down there
can see me."

16:47.320 --> 16:48.760
But a friend,
the other day, said

16:48.800 --> 16:50.840
"You know you can be
seen from the street?"

16:50.880 --> 16:52.760
-Oh, my God!
-Seriously.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.200
-But you can't see out
when you're in the shower?
-No, I said.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.240
-Well, the builder put the
glass in the wrong way round.
-Must have done.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.400
I think that builder
saw you coming.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.920
(LAUGHS)

17:02.960 --> 17:04.600
(APPLAUSE)

17:09.720 --> 17:12.280
-I think the only answer
for Rolls-Royce...
-Hold on.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.320
I just heard...
Is there a phone in there?

17:14.320 --> 17:16.080
No, you had a stroke.
Again.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.080
I'm sure I heard a phone.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.200
WOMAN: My school alarm,
I'm sorry.
-Was it you?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.400
-My school alarm,
I'm sorry.
-Your what alarm?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.800
My school alarm to pick
my kids up from school.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.520
Oh, well, that...
Now you're a terrible parent!

17:28.560 --> 17:32.280
(LAUGHTER)

17:32.320 --> 17:36.200
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
the art of great parenting,
right there!

17:36.240 --> 17:37.960
I'm gonna call the NSPCC
on you.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.520
How old are your children?

17:42.560 --> 17:45.320
-Oh, 11...
-Oh, for God's sake!

17:45.400 --> 17:47.320
She still hasn't moved.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.080
-Oh, they'll be fine.
-11, nine, eight and three.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.440
-I wasn't that interested.
-(LAUGHTER)

17:53.480 --> 17:57.560
We've established
they're not in their 30s,
is what I was trying to say.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.040
-Meanwhile...
-Yes.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.160
I don't think that
that one-way glass

18:01.200 --> 18:02.960
that isn't one-way
is gonna work.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.920
I think really Rolls-Royce's
only hope with that new car

18:05.960 --> 18:08.040
is they're gonna have
to hope they can find

18:08.080 --> 18:11.400
a lot of very rich people
with absolutely no taste.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.320
-That's their only chance.
-Where are they gonna find
people like that, I wonder?

18:15.400 --> 18:16.960
-Well, there's Cheshire.
-Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
-Dubai.
-Solihull, Monaco, Moscow.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.080
Beverly Hills.
They're gonna sell millions
of the things.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.920
Yeah, they are.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.080
Massive hit.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.080
Now, there's a man
in Nottingham.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.640
He's building a house
and he's told the planners that
outside,

18:29.680 --> 18:31.880
the big empty area,
is actually

18:31.920 --> 18:35.640
a landing pad for
a self-driving
electric flying car.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.320
Hm, yeah, that sounds like
what he's built is
a helicopter landing pad.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.920
Yes, it does,
it does sound very like that.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.760
Unless he's planning
to land there in this,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.320
the new Aston Martin
flying car.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.800
Looks very cool.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.480
No, Hammond,
that's not a flying car,
that's just a drawing

18:49.520 --> 18:52.640
of something that'll
never happen. It won't.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.560
But somebody has actually
made a real flying car
and I've got a picture.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.880
JEREMY: That's practical!
JAMES: Pretty dreary
actually, isn't it?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.760
JEREMY: You can't drive
that on the road.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.560
If you took it into town
and someone dinged
the folded-away wing,

19:03.560 --> 19:05.320
you couldn't fly it then.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.040
-Nobody flies
in a bent aeroplane.
-No, exactly.

19:08.080 --> 19:12.080
And when are people gonna
get it into their heads that
a flying car is an aeroplane?

19:12.080 --> 19:16.880
Because, if your car flies,
why the bloody hell would
you drive anywhere?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.560
I mean, it just doesn't
make sense.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.280
Or worse,
you're driving that,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.160
not feeling at all
self-conscious
around the M25,

19:23.200 --> 19:25.640
you hear there's a bit
of a traffic jam ahead,

19:25.680 --> 19:28.560
so you think,
"I'll lower the wings, build
up to a take-off speed

19:28.640 --> 19:30.080
of, what, 120, 150."

19:30.160 --> 19:32.560
The police will go, "What the
bloody hell are you doing?"

19:32.640 --> 19:36.320
They're gonna have a word.
You'd need to get a pilot's
licence to operate that.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.920
-That takes months.
-And then you'd have to learn
that gobbledegook you two...

19:39.960 --> 19:42.480
No, you'd have to learn to
communicate in the air--

19:42.520 --> 19:45.760
Yes, but you two don't talk
English when you get up
in there.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.760
There's a language so
you can pass information
quickly and clearly.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.000
Yes, but why do you got
your own alphabet for?

19:51.040 --> 19:53.240
"Did you come
through the alpha vector

19:53.280 --> 19:55.080
on the three approach
to four LH?

19:55.080 --> 19:57.400
Oh, I had to get on the tower
and say I was--"

19:57.440 --> 19:59.560
It's about controlled
airspace!

19:59.640 --> 20:02.000
"I was Mug Paper
Picture Oscar."

20:03.920 --> 20:06.400
Why do you have to have
a word for a letter?

20:06.440 --> 20:10.920
So that you know what the
letter is - a P and a B on a
crackly radio sound the same.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.040
Is that why you call him
a bunt all the time?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.760
JAMES AND RICHARD: Yes.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.240
That's exactly why,
so that it's clear.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.320
Now, there is a new report
which says the Scottish

20:20.400 --> 20:22.920
are the best drivers
in the world.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.640
If you think about it,
they've got Jim Clark,
Jackie Stewart,

20:25.680 --> 20:29.560
David Coulthard, Franchitti,
Allan McNish... What?

20:29.640 --> 20:33.240
No, not best in that way,
they mean the safest drivers
in the world.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.800
-That's what they mean.
-The safest drivers aren't
the best drivers.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.040
-Well, they sort of are.
-No, they aren't.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.920
If that were true,
if you think about it,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.080
I would be a better driver
than Jackie Stewart

20:42.080 --> 20:44.000
because I've had
fewer crashes.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.920
-But I'm not better, am I?
-No, you're emphatically not.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.800
-Exactly.
-What they're saying is...

20:48.800 --> 20:51.520
Actually, 51 per cent
of Scottish drivers

20:51.560 --> 20:53.480
have never been
in an accident.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.560
-51 per cent.
-That's not that good though.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.880
That means 49 per cent of
Scottish people have been

20:57.920 --> 20:59.800
in an accident.
That's nearly half of them.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.240
-Well--
-No, but it's "never" is the
big word, though, isn't it?

21:03.280 --> 21:06.080
I mean, never... Who here's
never had an accident?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.480
Never? But how long
have you been driving?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.520
Um...one month.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.560
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: Well done!

21:14.640 --> 21:16.960
-She's doing well.
-Well, there you go.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.320
RICHARD: Keep it up.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.000
Keep going.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.240
-That's better than you did.
-That's quite a record.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.680
(LAUGHTER)

21:26.720 --> 21:28.560
I did 36 hours before

21:28.560 --> 21:30.680
I was off the road with
no wheels on my car.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.680
Er...we'll drop that.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.720
That hasn't worked out
quite as well as I'd hoped.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.040
That is the end of
Conversation Street.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.400
RICHARD: Yes
-Thank you very much.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.480
Lovely, lovely.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.560
Now, this year marks
the 50th anniversary

21:50.560 --> 21:52.800
of the first landings
on the Moon,

21:52.880 --> 21:55.720
and I thought I should
take a little celebratory
look back

21:55.760 --> 21:58.200
at that truly
historic mission.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.640
James, this isn't
a grand tour of
whatever is in your head.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.800
-You do know that?
-No, but I promise

22:03.840 --> 22:06.440
there will be
some cars in this film.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.880
Eventually.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.680
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

22:13.720 --> 22:17.560
to achieving the goal
before this decade is out

22:17.600 --> 22:19.600
of landing a man on the Moon

22:19.640 --> 22:22.160
and returning him
safely to the Earth.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.800
JAMES: When President Kennedy
made that speech to Congress

22:25.840 --> 22:27.720
in 1961,

22:27.760 --> 22:32.680
he gave the scientists at
NASA a planet-sized headache.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.160
Let me try and put the size
of that headache into
some sort of perspective.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.800
When Kennedy
said those words,

22:37.840 --> 22:40.840
America's total experience
in space amounted to

22:40.880 --> 22:44.000
just one 15-minute
suborbital flight

22:44.040 --> 22:49.480
that reached an altitude
of just 116 miles
above the Earth.

22:49.520 --> 22:55.080
By contrast, a journey to
the Moon was 238,000 miles,

22:55.120 --> 22:59.000
and no rocket existed
that was powerful enough
to get the astronauts there.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.480
And even if they did
reach their destination,

23:03.520 --> 23:07.080
there was then
the immense challenge
of getting them home again.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.840
Let's imagine this basketball
I'm holding is the Earth,

23:10.880 --> 23:14.600
in which case the Moon
can be represented by
a baseball 23 feet away.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.080
There it is over there.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.400
All the space exploration
that had taken part so far,

23:19.440 --> 23:22.320
so all the Mercury capsules,
all the Soviet stuff,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.640
that happened about there.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.080
Now, the thickness
of this piece of paper

23:29.120 --> 23:32.800
represents the corridor
that the astronauts
would have to fly along

23:32.840 --> 23:35.360
to get home safely.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.800
Now, to do that, obviously
you'd want some sort of
guidance computer on board.

23:39.840 --> 23:43.720
Problem is, the computers
of the time were so huge
and so primitive,

23:43.760 --> 23:46.080
they lived
in their own buildings.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.200
And the President wanted all
this done within the decade.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.720
People thought he was mad.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.720
Nevertheless, the brains
at NASA knuckled down,

23:55.760 --> 23:58.440
and throughout the 1960s
set about developing

23:58.480 --> 24:01.680
and testing the rockets and
the technology that would be

24:01.720 --> 24:04.840
needed to crack
this monumental nut.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.800
However, machinery on
its own was not enough.

24:09.840 --> 24:13.040
Equally important
to the success of
the space programme

24:13.080 --> 24:15.680
were the astronauts.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.960
Now, these men
were generally of a type.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.040
They were fighter jocks
and test pilots,

24:20.080 --> 24:23.520
and they were very
familiar with moving around
at very high speed.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.360
So, and I did promise we'd
get some cars into this,

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
when it came to moving around
on the face of the Earth,

24:29.440 --> 24:32.160
there was one car they
favoured above all others.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.480
(ROCK MUSIC)

24:43.840 --> 24:45.560
The Corvette -

24:45.600 --> 24:47.920
America's "premier"
sports car.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.320
The big love-in between
the American astronauts
and the Corvette

24:54.360 --> 24:56.080
started with Alan Shepard...

24:57.520 --> 25:00.280
...the first American
in space in 1961.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
And on his safe
return to Earth,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.720
he was given a free Corvette
by General Motors,

25:05.760 --> 25:09.200
a sort of medal
for services to the country.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.760
(MILITARY MARCH PLAYS)

25:10.800 --> 25:13.680
However, even though
Shepard was deemed worthy

25:13.720 --> 25:17.440
of a tickertape
hero's welcome
by the American public,

25:17.480 --> 25:21.520
NASA saw astronauts like him
as government employees,

25:21.560 --> 25:25.840
and as such,
unable to accept free gifts.

25:30.120 --> 25:35.360
So, an enterprising Corvette
dealer near the Cape Kennedy
Space Center in Florida

25:35.400 --> 25:37.320
came up with a cunning idea.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.640
He offered the astronauts
a special deal

25:41.680 --> 25:46.880
whereby they could lease
a Corvette for the enormous
sum of...one dollar.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.640
Now, NASA couldn't
complain about that.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.200
Technically the cars
weren't free,
they were being paid for.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.360
So all the astronauts
bit his hand off.

25:57.400 --> 26:02.240
Gus Grissom, the second
American in space, had one.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.040
So did Gordon Cooper,
a man so cool

26:05.080 --> 26:07.240
he actually fell asleep
on the launch pad

26:07.280 --> 26:09.280
while waiting for lift-off.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.800
Jim Lovell,
the hero of the ill-fated

26:11.840 --> 26:15.120
"Houston, we've had a
problem" Apollo 13 mission -

26:15.160 --> 26:17.440
he too was a Corvette man.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.720
Basically,
in the '60s and '70s,

26:19.760 --> 26:22.080
Cape Kennedy
and the surrounding roads

26:22.120 --> 26:25.760
were awash with spacemen
driving one-dollar Corvettes.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.320
But it was the holy trinity
of Shepard, Cooper
and Grissom

26:32.360 --> 26:35.480
who were
the real petrolheads.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.000
The good news for them
was that the Space Center
here at Kennedy

26:39.040 --> 26:42.320
was criss-crossed with
lovely wide, straight roads

26:42.360 --> 26:45.040
which NASA engineers
used to move stuff about -

26:45.080 --> 26:48.040
i.e. rockets.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.640
But that meant, as far as
those three were concerned,

26:50.680 --> 26:53.200
that they were in heaven.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.680
They'd come to places
like this after work

26:55.720 --> 26:58.120
and just drag race
the hell out of their cars,

26:58.160 --> 26:59.720
and then they'd
have them modified,

26:59.760 --> 27:02.080
and then they'd drag race
them a bit more.

27:02.120 --> 27:06.560
Gordo Cooper allegedly
had his car modified
up to 180 miles an hour,

27:06.600 --> 27:09.960
and he and Gus Grissom
even used to go and pit crew

27:10.000 --> 27:12.400
for a racing team
if they had a weekend off.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.360
They liked cars.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.280
Then there was astronaut
John Glenn,

27:19.320 --> 27:21.880
the first American
to orbit the Earth,

27:21.920 --> 27:24.160
and as a test pilot,
the first man

27:24.200 --> 27:28.920
to cross
the American continent
at supersonic speeds.

27:28.960 --> 27:32.160
Clearly,
this was a man comfortable
with putting his foot down.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.120
However, the car he drove

27:35.160 --> 27:38.960
was not quite as sporty
as a Corvette.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.120
Yes, John Glenn, holder of
supersonic flight records

27:43.160 --> 27:46.600
and the first American to
orbit the Earth, drove this.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.920

It's made by the long-dead
German car maker NSU,

27:55.440 --> 27:58.720
and it's a microscopic
economy car.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.400
It has an engine of just
under 600cc, two cylinders.

about the sedate pace.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.120
He lived out in the sticks,

28:20.160 --> 28:22.200
he had a long commute
to Cape Kennedy,

28:22.240 --> 28:26.720
and he wanted a car that
gave him good gas mileage.

(ENGINE REVS)

28:42.160 --> 28:46.520
I've read accounts by the
astronauts of what the rocket
launches were actually like -

28:46.560 --> 28:49.720
a lot of noise, a lot of
clattering, a lot of banging.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.000
Well, John Glenn was ready.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.080
By 1969, just inside
Kennedy's deadline,

29:00.120 --> 29:03.520
NASA was ready to try landing
some men on the Moon.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.320
The astronauts chosen
were Buzz Aldrin,

29:08.360 --> 29:09.960
who drove a Corvette,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.320
Neil Armstrong,
who drove a Corvette,

29:13.360 --> 29:16.040
and Mike Collins,
who drove a Beetle.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.280
Presumably that's
why they left him
in the command module

29:19.320 --> 29:21.760
and didn't let him walk
on the lunar surface.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.960
The rocket that would take
them there, the Saturn V,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.800
was, and remains, the most
complex machine ever built.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.520
It was constructed of
three million components,

29:39.560 --> 29:42.080
all of them provided, as
the astronauts, used to joke,

29:42.120 --> 29:43.760

At blast-off, these
five engines produced

30:07.320 --> 30:10.160
seven-and-a-half million
pounds of thrust.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.160
During the first-stage burn,
the rocket produced

30:16.200 --> 30:19.040
enough power to light

30:19.080 --> 30:21.000

It burnt its fuel at a rate
of 20 tonnes per second

30:27.120 --> 30:29.720
and just two-and-a-half
minutes after launch,

30:29.760 --> 30:32.440
nearly all of it was gone...

30:32.480 --> 30:36.160
...leaving just enough
to take the three astronauts
to the Moon

30:36.200 --> 30:39.320
and return them safely
to Earth.

get Chlamydia,
and the next morning,

35:24.480 --> 35:26.840
they'd be upside down
in a star fighter.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.200
Whereas I met one
not that long ago,

35:29.280 --> 35:31.960
he was the first astronaut
ever to dock
the space shuttle

35:32.000 --> 35:33.960
to the space station
in space,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.880
and he turned up for
the interview in a maroon
Toyota Camry.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.280
And...

35:39.320 --> 35:43.520
And he had his polo shirt
tucked into his chinos.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.960
Your point
about the polo shirt is?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.840
My point is very simple, OK?

35:47.880 --> 35:49.960
You look at pictures
from the space station.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.760
I follow it on Instagram.
Look at this.

35:52.800 --> 35:58.160
I mean, I'm sorry, they look
like people who run
a port-a-loo rental company.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.360
If you go for an audition
with NASA, yeah,

36:00.400 --> 36:03.120
and you don't arrive in
the car park in your Corvette

36:03.160 --> 36:05.840
on full opposite lock,
you don't get the job.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.040
They should get the maths
out of the space programme

36:08.080 --> 36:09.920
and replace it
with some flamboyance.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.120
You probably need
a little bit of maths.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.400
No, you don't, you just want
them to be funny.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.560
No, that's children's
entertainers you're thinking
of, Jeremy.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.880
- Not astronauts.
- Buzz Aldrin,

36:19.920 --> 36:21.760
a flamboyant man, used to
wear shirts like that.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.640
I met him, he had
an excellent shirt on.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.160
Very funny.
One of my favourite stories
about Buzz Aldrin,

36:26.200 --> 36:28.960
second man on the Moon,
you mentioned him
in your film.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.960
He was being interviewed many
years after the Moon landing.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.960
Very nervous young reporter
standing there.
Live interview, this was.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.880
"We're going over live now,"

36:37.920 --> 36:40.160
and the director's going,
"In five, four..."

36:40.200 --> 36:42.960
And on three,
Buzz Aldrin leant to
the reporter and went,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.600
-"Nothing about the Moon, OK?"
-(LAUGHTER)

36:46.640 --> 36:50.000
-"That's all I've got!"
-"I've got no questions!
I've got literally nothing!"

36:50.040 --> 36:53.120
Anyway, that's enough about
space. I wanna move it on.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.040
Because I came into the
office um...the other day

36:56.080 --> 36:59.640
and told these two that
the Citroen C3 Aircross

36:59.640 --> 37:01.600
that I'd been driving
was very good.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.440
And they said it wasn't.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
-Because it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.960
And I decided
to prove that it is

37:08.000 --> 37:10.640
by doing one of those
very thorough tests

37:10.640 --> 37:12.880
where we cover
all the things that matter

37:12.920 --> 37:15.120
in a car of this type.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.400
Wait a minute, is this gonna
be one of those stupid films

37:17.440 --> 37:19.400
where you do ridiculous
tests to discover

37:19.440 --> 37:22.440
if a car can, I dunno,
drive faster than itself?

37:22.480 --> 37:23.440
No.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.040
JEREMY:
This is the car in question.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.360
It's a five-seater,
front-wheel drive hatchback.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.440
Prices start at Â£14,720

37:35.480 --> 37:37.160
and it looks rather funky,

37:37.160 --> 37:40.520
with those splashes of
orange paint here and there.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.640
It's also easy to see out of

37:47.640 --> 37:51.640
because the windows
are made from glass.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.640
And all the controls
fall easily to hand,

37:54.680 --> 37:57.040
because they're on
the dashboard
or the steering wheel,

37:57.080 --> 38:00.160
rather than
under the carpet in the boot.

38:02.840 --> 38:06.120
But you may be wondering
what makes it so special.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.400
Well, to find out, I've
decided to break the test

38:09.440 --> 38:11.120
down into segments,

38:11.160 --> 38:14.080
so that all the important
questions can be answered.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.200
To find out, we've come here

38:22.280 --> 38:25.440
to the banked Millbrook Bowl
in Bedfordshire.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.640
Citroen say
that because the quite small,

38:32.680 --> 38:35.360
1.2 litre,
three-cylinder engine

38:35.400 --> 38:38.800
in this particular version of
the Aircross is turbocharged,

38:38.840 --> 38:43.880
it produces 128 horsepower.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.800
And now it's time
to see what that means

38:46.840 --> 38:48.560
in terms of top speed.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.200
And here we go.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.640
Obviously you can't go
as fast on a banked track

38:57.640 --> 39:00.480
as you can
on the straight and level.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.520
I was going to ask James May
why this is so,

39:03.560 --> 39:07.360
but um...I was frightened
he might tell me so I...

39:07.400 --> 39:08.920
so I didn't.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.760
That's 100, moving up
into the fifth lane,

39:13.800 --> 39:15.600
the lane of terror.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.880
114, there it is.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.840
And I think that's it.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.880
Top speed is...

39:23.920 --> 39:25.200
Oh, 115. No.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.280
The little car
has more to give.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.040
Right, I think we've
established there

39:34.080 --> 39:37.160
that this car's top speed
here on the Millbrook Bowl

39:37.160 --> 39:39.160
is 115 miles an hour.

39:39.200 --> 39:43.640
And that, for a practical,
high-riding, family SUV,

39:43.640 --> 39:46.920
which can do 50 miles to the
gallon in ordinary driving,

39:46.960 --> 39:48.560
is not bad.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.600
But can it do better?

39:53.640 --> 39:57.680
OK, what I've done now is
hooked up to the back end
of a Bentley Bentayga.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.880
Now, this is a car
with a top speed

39:59.920 --> 40:01.880
of 180 miles an hour.

40:08.040 --> 40:12.040
What it's doing is,
it's punching a hole
in the air for me

40:12.080 --> 40:14.200
and I'm driving along
in a vacuum.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.680
So that should mean
I go faster. Let's find out.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.400
That's 115 easily.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.120
116...

40:26.600 --> 40:27.920
117...

40:30.680 --> 40:32.320
I'm also using less fuel,

40:32.360 --> 40:35.520
so this is good for
the environment as well.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.640
119, 120 miles an hour now.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.000
121...this is flying!

40:43.120 --> 40:46.600
122 miles an hour, 123!

40:46.640 --> 40:48.400
What we're doing now
is proving

40:48.440 --> 40:54.480
that the Citroen C3 Aircross
can go faster than itself.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.560
124!

40:56.600 --> 40:59.920
God's truth,
it's like being in Bluebird!

40:59.960 --> 41:03.560
My only worry is that
I just saw a single magpie

41:03.600 --> 41:06.600
and it is Friday the 13th
as I do this.

41:06.640 --> 41:10.520
So now I'm gonna ease out
of this dangerous situation.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.520
Well, if the space is
smaller than the Aircross,

41:21.560 --> 41:23.480
then the answer is no.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.640
But if the space is bigger,
then the answer is yes.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.080
And with that sorted out,

41:34.120 --> 41:36.920
it's time for one of
the most important tests

41:36.960 --> 41:38.680
a little car can face.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.440
To find out, I've come
to Southampton docks,

41:48.480 --> 41:51.880
where obviously I've been
forced to wear a hard hat

41:51.920 --> 41:55.120
in case a ship...
lands on my head.

41:55.160 --> 41:59.080
Anyway, as you can see, the
little car has been attached

41:59.120 --> 42:02.960
by rope to the enormous
car transporter.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.400
Which I've just noticed
has a face.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.400
It's Boaty McBoatface!

42:14.920 --> 42:16.560
The challenge
I'd come up with

42:16.600 --> 42:19.480
was to see
if the one-tonne C3

42:19.520 --> 42:22.760
could pull
the 13,000-tonne ship

42:22.800 --> 42:24.800
a distance of 25 metres.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.360
Right, now, I should explain

42:29.400 --> 42:31.040
that my colleagues
May and Hammond

42:31.080 --> 42:33.280
think this is a stupid test.

42:33.320 --> 42:38.000
They say the Aircross
only develops 151 torques

42:38.040 --> 42:42.000
and that that isn't enough to
pull a medium-sized child.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.760

The ship's going back!

43:11.560 --> 43:12.920

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
The ship is going back.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.520
What... The situation's bad.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.400
As we reattached
the tow rope,

43:22.440 --> 43:25.400
I wondered
what had gone wrong.

43:25.440 --> 43:29.040
Why did... Did he put
his engines in reverse
as a sort of amusing joke?

43:29.080 --> 43:30.640
I mean, he is Greek,
the captain.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.120
We're not German! It's...

43:32.160 --> 43:35.560
We didn't mess
your economy up.

43:35.600 --> 43:39.400
With the rope reattached,
we began the test again.

for the final test,

54:18.480 --> 54:19.880
the big one -

54:19.920 --> 54:21.880
the answer to
the question I'm asked

54:21.920 --> 54:24.200
five or six times a day.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.240
Italy is a difficult country
to invade,

54:31.280 --> 54:34.480
because it's surrounded
on three sides by sea

54:34.520 --> 54:37.520
and on the fourth
by mountains.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.640
These mountains.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.800
The Alps.

54:43.840 --> 54:46.520
But back in 218 BC,

54:46.560 --> 54:48.880
a Tunisian general
called Hannibal

54:48.920 --> 54:50.720
did cross
those mountains,

54:50.760 --> 54:53.720
using elephants
to carry his gear.

54:53.760 --> 54:55.320
And what I want to know is:

54:55.360 --> 54:57.760
could he have used
an Aircross instead?

54:57.800 --> 55:00.040
I mean, obviously,
the Aircross wasn't invented

55:00.080 --> 55:01.800
200 years before
the Baby Jesus,

55:01.840 --> 55:04.600
but if it had been,
could he have used it?

55:13.960 --> 55:17.200
We know that the Citroen
is powerful and torquey.

55:17.240 --> 55:21.880
But what really matters on
a job like this is traction.

55:24.600 --> 55:28.160
And that's where this knob
down here comes in.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.280
It engages something called
the grip control system.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.320
And that sounds
like a gimmick.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.120
But it isn't.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.280
Last winter, Britain was
hit with a weather bomb

55:40.320 --> 55:43.480
which became known as
the Beast from the East.

55:43.520 --> 55:47.040
Everything stopped
and nothing was moving,

55:47.080 --> 55:50.440
apart from me in an Aircross.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.680
I genuinely
couldn't believe it.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.320
I put it in snow mode and
it was going through drifts

55:56.360 --> 55:58.280
up to its door handles.

56:00.200 --> 56:03.360
So let's see if it can pull
off the same trick here,

56:03.400 --> 56:06.760
when the track runs out
and the going gets tougher.

56:11.560 --> 56:15.680
Yes, look at the little
Citroen, clawing away.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.080
No elephant could do this.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.040
I am zooming up here.

56:30.840 --> 56:34.200
God knows what sorcery
the computers are using

56:34.240 --> 56:36.160
to keep me going here,
but they are.

56:38.560 --> 56:40.080
(CHUCKLING)

56:42.240 --> 56:43.720
Downhill stretch here,

56:43.760 --> 56:46.600
so engaging
the hill descent control.

56:46.640 --> 56:51.240
Take your foot off the clutch
and off the brake.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.520
You can hear the anti-lock
brake system working,

56:53.560 --> 56:56.240
keeping me in check,

56:56.280 --> 56:59.800
stopping the back
sliding round,
stopping me accelerating.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.160
That's so clever
in a little car like this!

57:04.760 --> 57:08.840
But as the climb resumed,
the going got really rough.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.000
No, no.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.520
Let's just pop it into...

57:16.560 --> 57:17.840
mud mode.

57:22.240 --> 57:25.000
There we go.
There you have it.

57:25.040 --> 57:28.400
Come on, little car,
come on, little car.

57:28.440 --> 57:31.640
That's the engine mountings
you can hear wobbling away,

57:31.680 --> 57:35.120
but the good news is,
the engine is still in.

57:38.120 --> 57:43.920
With the satnav telling me
Italy was just two miles
away, I found another path.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.480
I've passed
2,000 metres here.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.400
Christ,
if I go over the edge now...

57:53.720 --> 57:54.840
Agh.

57:58.720 --> 58:03.120
Finally, the border
moved into view.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.120
Come on, little Aircross!

58:17.680 --> 58:19.600
There you are, clever car!

58:28.960 --> 58:30.600
So there we are.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.120
Faster than itself
at the test track.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
Strong enough to pull a ship.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.440
Big enough for the entire
Jolie family and a horse.

58:38.480 --> 58:41.880
And better at invading Italy
than an elephant.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.920
Are you all right?

58:58.960 --> 59:01.760
-In the head, I mean.
-What do you mean?

59:01.800 --> 59:03.560
We learned nothing.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.040
You learned it could get
to the top of that mountain,

59:06.080 --> 59:07.840
even though it doesn't
have four-wheel drive.

59:07.880 --> 59:10.760
But what about things
that matter to people
who buy that sort of car?

59:10.800 --> 59:13.320
What about, you know,
boot, interior space?

59:13.360 --> 59:17.680
-I did boot!
-OK, safety, insurance group,
all that.

59:17.720 --> 59:20.600
-That's a bit boring.
-And are you seriously
expecting us to believe

59:20.640 --> 59:22.160
that a little
French hatchback

59:22.200 --> 59:26.080
can catch a tuned De Tomaso
Pantera on a mountain road?

59:26.120 --> 59:28.920
Well, you say that -
James Bond, Goldeneye,
you may remember.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.800
He is in his Aston DB5,
he's chasing the Ferrari 355,

59:31.840 --> 59:33.360
he caught up with it.

something like that.

diesel-powered Alfa 159,

59:43.600 --> 59:45.280
keep up with him
no problem at all.

59:45.320 --> 59:48.120
You do know they're not
documentaries, don't you?

59:48.160 --> 59:51.280
It was The Rock, The Rock was
a Hummer and a Ferrari again.

59:51.320 --> 59:55.920
Look, can we try and salvage
some useful information
out of this?

59:55.960 --> 59:57.320
There's no need.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.960
No, there is, I mean, OK...

59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.640
lsn't that Citroen basically,
tell me if I'm right,

1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:03.680
the same car as
the Vauxhall Crossland?

1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:05.400
-It is.
-Yes, it is, good point.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:08.120
So, for instance, would you
buy one of those instead?

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:12.280
Well, you can't have
the Vauxhall with
the grip control system,

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:13.960
so it's no good
as an elephant.

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.240
No, the elephant test
isn't actually relevant.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:20.680
Is there not something um...
OK, the Vauxhall, is it...

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:24.000
How easy is it to vacuum out
the interior? There you go.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:25.800
I knew you were gonna
mention that.

1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:28.520
So what I did was I took
the Vauxhall down to a man

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:30.640
who knows a thing or two
about vacuuming,

1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:33.720
