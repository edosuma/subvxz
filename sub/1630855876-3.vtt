WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:04.436
(mysterious music)

00:48.348 --> 00:49.614
- Oh, hello, ladies!

00:49.683 --> 00:53.218
You two look wonderful today.
What's the occasion?

00:53.353 --> 00:55.387
- Oh! We now need
an occasion to look good?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.556
- No. Of course not.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.658
- We're having our portrait
painted today.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.829
- Oh, right! Yes.
I hope it turns out well.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.964
- You know, william,
I was thinking:

01:05.966 --> 01:08.634
Perhaps we're not exposing
susannah to enough art.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.104
- At her age?
How much art appreciation

01:12.239 --> 01:13.705
Are we hoping to cultivate?

01:13.741 --> 01:16.442
- Well, you're attempting
to cultivate an understanding

01:16.577 --> 01:20.712
Of maxwell's electromagnetic
equations.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.847
- Oh, yes. That's easier
to understand.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.717
(scoffs)
- this is something, isn't it?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.586
That painting that was stolen
from the louvre

01:27.655 --> 01:30.055
Still hasn't been recovered.
It's been two weeks.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.724
- Oh?
- It's called the mona lisa

01:32.760 --> 01:34.393
By leonardo da vinci.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.928
- Da vinci, a scientist!

01:36.964 --> 01:38.530
- And a painter.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.866
Although I hadn't heard
of this piece.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.068
- Do they have any leads yet?

01:43.203 --> 01:46.471
- Ah, "authorities, surprised
by the brazen theft,

01:46.507 --> 01:48.406
Are searching for
their chief suspect,

01:48.408 --> 01:50.742
Art student jacques martine."

01:51.846 --> 01:55.079
Well, we must be off.
Wish us luck.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.081
- Good luck.
- Mm-hmm.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.217
(susannah babbling)

02:05.860 --> 02:07.993
- Little susannah is growing
just like a weed!

02:08.762 --> 02:10.094
- What are you suggesting?

02:10.131 --> 02:13.031
- It's a compliment.
Growing quickly.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.301
- Oh! Yes. Thank you.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.170
(phone ringing)

02:20.307 --> 02:21.573
Detective murdoch.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.209
Aboard the ship?

02:25.212 --> 02:27.179
Has the victim been
identified yet?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.917
(tense music)

02:37.658 --> 02:38.790
- Who's this, then?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.859
- A mister jacques martine.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.328
- A frenchman.
Coming to canada for a visit?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.197
- Or fleeing the scene
of the crime.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.065
Mr. Martine here
may be wanted for the theft

02:47.201 --> 02:50.002
Of a valuable painting
called the mona lisa.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.003
- La gioconda.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.007
The cultured among us
know her as la gioconda,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.341
The joyful lady.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.409
- Yes. Well, the joyful lady

02:58.445 --> 03:00.479
May be the reason
for this murder.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.614
(mysterious music)

03:07.321 --> 03:10.155
(indistinct chatter)

03:12.793 --> 03:14.626
- He was struck on the head
several times.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.561
I'll have to check
for defensive wounds.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.130
- And no sign of that painting?

03:18.132 --> 03:19.664
- If he had it.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.199
- Likely motive, if he did.

03:21.334 --> 03:22.967
He lets someone in,
they see the mona lisa

03:23.003 --> 03:24.169
And kill him for it.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.271
- Oh, I read about
that painting in the paper.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.373
Do we think this man stole it?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.574
- Possibly.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.244
- Fresh paint on this palette.
But there's no paintings.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.647
- Hm. Any thoughts
on the murder weapon?

03:35.782 --> 03:37.182
- Ah, something small,

03:37.317 --> 03:40.252
Approximately a few centimetres
in width with sharp edges.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.920
- Right.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.257
Let's get all of these items
down to the station house

03:45.259 --> 03:47.459
And see if there's
a murder weapon amongst them.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.062
Oh. Uh, mr. Dubois?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.331
- Ah, yes.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.134
I've been working on this boat
for the last three years.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.869
First time I see
something like this.

03:57.938 --> 04:02.274
- Hm. Don't cabin stewards
work solely in first class?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.942
- Ah, indeed, sir.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.012
- Then how is it that
you came upon mr. Martine?

04:07.081 --> 04:10.015
- Um, I-I was asked to-to
check that everyone had gone up

04:10.017 --> 04:12.751
To the main deck to disembark
and, uh,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.520
The door was open.
I-I saw him on the ground.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.690
- Was there anyone else here,

04:18.825 --> 04:20.959
In the hallway,
or one of the other cabins?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.227
- No, sir.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.165
- Right. Did you move
anything in this cabin?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.835
- After I found him dead?
Of course not. No.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.873
- Thank you.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.045
- This is outrageous!
- Do you know to whom

04:40.047 --> 04:41.546
You are speaking?

04:41.582 --> 04:42.714
- What seems to be the problem?

04:42.849 --> 04:46.184
- This constable will not permit
my daughter and I to pass.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.453
We would like
to disembark this instant.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.589
- There's an ongoing murder
investigation, I'm afraid.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.658
And my constable here
is only doing his duty.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.327
- Oh, do you really think
we would have anything

04:55.396 --> 04:57.229
To do with that?
- Well, I wouldn't know

04:57.231 --> 04:58.563
That yet, would I?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.031
- My name is lady isabelle.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.200
And this is my father,
arthur rawley,

05:02.236 --> 05:03.868
The duke of surrey.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.870
- Oh, sir. I do apologize.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.774
Uh, your grace.
Constable, let them through.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.348
Oi, you in the suit.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.684
You can't go down there.
It's a crime scene.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.887
(speaks italian)

05:22.022 --> 05:24.089
I was only looking
for something.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.556
- And you left it in your berth?

05:25.592 --> 05:30.562
- No, no. Think mr. Martine
has it... Have it.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.697
- Oh?
- My match case.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.101
I-I lend it to him,
but, uh, he did not return it.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.302
Can I go to see?

05:37.437 --> 05:38.737
- I'm afraid not.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.173
You knew the dead man, did you?

05:41.175 --> 05:44.409
- No, no! H-his room
was next to mine. That's all.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.444
But you know who I did
see him with?

05:47.314 --> 05:48.446
Lady isabelle.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.053
She would sneak down
to the third-class lounge.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.688
- Is that right?

06:00.260 --> 06:03.528
- This is decidedly not how
my first day in canada

06:03.564 --> 06:04.996
Should be progressing.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.265
- I understand.
However, we do need to ask

06:07.267 --> 06:08.466
Your daughter some questions.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.802
- I don't see what my daughter
has to do with any of this.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.737
- I can answer for myself, papa.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.940
- What were you doing consorting
with passengers

06:15.976 --> 06:17.409
In third-class quarters?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.677
- Isabelle?!

06:18.812 --> 06:21.613
- I wanted to talk
to other artists, papa.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.881
- Artists?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.682
What about that
nice chap in first?

06:24.684 --> 06:27.018
- Ugh...
- Lord william?

06:27.087 --> 06:30.121
He collects etchings.
- No, real artists.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.890
Like monsieur martine.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.426
- Yes. How well did you
get to know mr. Martine?

06:35.462 --> 06:37.962
- Oh, well, hardly at all.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.366
I was never alone with him,
of course.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.902
- Who else was there
during your visits?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.505
- A very, uh...

06:47.574 --> 06:49.474
Forthright woman.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.609
She had studied in paris

06:50.611 --> 06:52.577
And claimed to know
all about painting.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.379
- Hm.
- I saw her in the company

06:54.448 --> 06:56.114
Of mr. Martine many times.

06:56.183 --> 07:00.318
- And this woman, did she
and mr. Martine seem close?

07:00.354 --> 07:01.820
- No.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.422
No, in fact,

07:03.557 --> 07:05.223
I saw them argue.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.124
I think they rather
hated each other.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.126
- Hm.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.595
Right.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.430
I'll be needing
this woman's name.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.665
- Miss emily carr.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.801
Thank you for coming in
to answer some questions.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.937
- I would say you're welcome,
but it would be a lie.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.472
So, please, be quick about it.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.542
- You were familiar
with the victim,

07:23.544 --> 07:25.477
Mr. Martine, were you not?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.612
- I was.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.681
- Apparently,
the two of you fought.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.017
(sighs)
- we had a disagreement,

07:32.019 --> 07:33.417
But I wouldn't call it a fight.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.820
- What did the two of you
argue about?

07:36.757 --> 07:37.856
- Art.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.091
He was enthralled
by the old masters.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.696
I said that he should be open
to a more expressive style,

07:44.765 --> 07:47.065
Not to strive
for mere verisimilitude,

07:47.134 --> 07:50.735
But to paint with
the mind's eye.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.639
- So a professional
disagreement.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.977
- Art is more
than mere profession,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.012
Detective murdoch.
It's a vocation.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.716
- Did you ever visit
mr. Martine's cabin?

08:04.851 --> 08:06.417
- Oh, good heavens!

08:06.453 --> 08:10.789
No. I stay well clear
of any and all men.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.590
I'm telling you,
I barely knew him.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.994
- All the same, I would like
a print of your fingermarks

08:15.996 --> 08:17.362
Before you leave, miss carr.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.931
- As you wish.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.768
(curious music)

08:26.740 --> 08:28.273
Who did this?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.074
- I did.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.044
- It's a serious question.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.612
- It was a serious answer.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.281
(carr gasps)

08:36.283 --> 08:39.617
- You have a strong sense
of colour and vitality.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.386
- Yes, I would think I do.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.622
- Sincerely...

08:45.158 --> 08:47.359
It's very good.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.827
I feel almost humbled.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.499
- Well, I certainly
hope she's innocent, murdoch.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.369
She's obviously
a woman of taste.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.243
- Hello!
- Oh!

09:05.245 --> 09:06.844
- What have you, miss hart?

09:06.846 --> 09:07.979
- I've completed my postmortem,

09:08.048 --> 09:10.248
But I haven't typed up
my report just yet.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.850
- Do you know
the cause of death?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.585
- Well, he died from
his head injuries.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.787
Nothing more.
- I see.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.255
- All the blows caused
a subdural hematoma.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.892
He was hale and hearty
otherwise.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.093
Oh!

09:22.228 --> 09:24.062
I also found these
in the wounds.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.865
- Pieces of mirror?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.500
- I think so.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.070
- Odd.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.138
(indistinct chatter)

09:34.174 --> 09:35.974
Mr. Martine's suitcase.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.743
- Oh? Entrancing.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.212
Just a hint of annoying smile

09:41.348 --> 09:43.481
As though she has a secret.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.116
- Well, they all do, don't they?

09:46.453 --> 09:47.619
(suitcase lock clicks)

09:47.754 --> 09:48.720
- Ah-ha.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.625
- Hm.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.495
- This must be that bloke's
match case.

09:57.564 --> 10:02.500
- Manganese oxide.
Azurite. Verdigris?

10:02.636 --> 10:05.169
- Oils. Spike lavender.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.372
Mr. Martine must be
making his own paints.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.507
- What's this?
- What's that?

10:09.509 --> 10:10.575
- What's what?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.044
(curious music)

10:13.080 --> 10:14.546
- Well, judging by
the blood here,

10:14.681 --> 10:16.781
I'd say we've found
our murder weapon.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.252
- Hello?

10:25.359 --> 10:26.725
- Yes?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.326
- I-I'm looking for mr. Bernier.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.061
He's painting
a portrait of me today.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.596
- I sent him home.

10:31.731 --> 10:32.764
- I'm sorry?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.599
- Everything is cancelled.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.934
There's just so much
to do before tomorrow night.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.370
- Wh-what's happening
tomorrow night?

10:39.406 --> 10:43.074
- We received a call
from lady isabelle herself

10:43.209 --> 10:45.476
Wanting to exhibit
her paintings, here!

10:45.512 --> 10:46.478
Isn't that wonderful?

10:46.613 --> 10:49.347
- Yes, quite.
But we had an arrangement.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.751
- It's not every day that we get
the chance to display the works

10:52.886 --> 10:55.153
Of such a distinguished artist.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.788
Of course you understand.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.624
- - Yes. Of course.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.159
Oh! Detective watts!
What are you doing here?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.696
- I'm looking for a painting.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.964
- Well, good luck.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.333
- I don't have time
for any enquiries.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.370
- I can see you are a busy man.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.073
But I only have one question.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.009
Surely you have time
for one question?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.045
- Very well.
(chuckles)

11:21.982 --> 11:23.982
You're a detective, I gather?

11:24.117 --> 11:26.584
- Ah, now it is you
who has a question.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.188
(chuckling)
- well, go on, then.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.258
- Has anyone come in here
looking to discreetly sell

11:33.393 --> 11:36.194
A sixteenth-century painting
called the mona lisa?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.262
- The mona lisa?
- Mm.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.464
- Oh, good heavens, no! No.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.200
But a man did come
in this morning

11:42.202 --> 11:44.068
Looking to sell
some renaissance art.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.236
- Oh?
- Yeah.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.539
Something seemed off to me.
I didn't trust him.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.140
I told him to leave.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.875
- Did he give you a name?

11:50.911 --> 11:54.679
- Yes. Hm. I doubt it was
his real one. He t--

11:54.814 --> 11:58.349
He told me that if I changed
my mind and wanted to, uh,

11:58.351 --> 12:00.618
Discuss a sale,
he would be staying

12:00.654 --> 12:04.889
At the park embassy hotel
under the name mr. Raphael.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.093
- Mr. Raphael. Thank you, mr...

12:08.228 --> 12:09.861
- Lash.
- Lash.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.830
(curious music)

12:12.966 --> 12:13.898
- Huh.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.234
- Even though the suitcase
was in the water,

12:16.303 --> 12:18.569
I've managed to pull
a fingermark from this.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.773
- Must be something
to paint with,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.908
But I've never seen
anything like it.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.611
- Ooh! Very interesting.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.312
- You have a match?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.650
- Miss emily carr.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.855
- Perhaps art is not
her only vocation.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.860
- I've told you
I barely knew him.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.265
- Miss carr, your fingermarks

12:47.400 --> 12:50.668
Are on what very well
could be the murder weapon.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.004
- That's impossible.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.009
That's the murder weapon?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.345
Well, I might have picked it up,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.280
But I certainly
didn't kill him with it.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.086
Mr. Martine
was a very direct man.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.288
He asked me if he could
borrow some of my brushes.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.157
I said no and then
he went into my cabin,

13:13.226 --> 13:14.692
And he took them for himself.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.095
- And what did you do?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.696
- I waited until he was
out of his cabin,

13:18.832 --> 13:20.965
And then I took them right back.

13:22.101 --> 13:25.169
And then I saw that thing
on the table,

13:25.172 --> 13:27.772
And I picked it up
to look at it.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.442
- What's this used for?

13:31.511 --> 13:34.312
- It's some kind
of drawing aid, I imagine.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.983
- Why did you not tell me before
that you broke into his cabin?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.320
- I'm no fool. I knew it would
look as though I was guilty,

13:42.322 --> 13:45.056
But I-I'm telling you,

13:45.058 --> 13:48.192
I would not kill
over my brushes,

13:48.195 --> 13:49.794
Even if they are the best sable.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.664
- I'll be needing
your whereabouts

13:52.799 --> 13:55.133
For the last 24 hours
aboard the ship.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.268
- I was in the breakfast room,

13:57.403 --> 13:59.137
Then I was in the library
all morning;

13:59.139 --> 14:00.671
Many people saw me.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.140
But the night before,

14:02.142 --> 14:03.674
I was by myself.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.576
I require my solitude.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.081
- Unfortunately,
solitude does not

14:10.083 --> 14:12.550
Constitute an alibi,
miss carr.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.420
- 17 brookham drive.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.690
I'll be there for
the foreseeable future.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.357
- See that you are.
Detective murdoch may want

14:20.393 --> 14:21.359
To speak with you again.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.627
- Yes, constable. May I go now?

14:23.663 --> 14:26.230
I'm expecting a delivery
of my painting supplies.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.266
- Ah, yes. Thank you.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.772
- Pardon me.
I couldn't help overhear.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.707
Are you a painter?
- Yes.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.242
- Well, how wonderful.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.144
Would I have seen
your work anywhere?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.280
- Well, that depends.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.715
Were you at the salon d'automne
in paris?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.052
- No, but that does sound grand.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.787
Do you paint portraits?

14:50.924 --> 14:52.790
- On occasion.
- Would you accept a commission?

14:52.792 --> 14:55.660
My daughter and I were to have
our portrait painted today

14:55.662 --> 14:58.463
And it fell through, and I know
you've only just met me,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.198
But may I ask
if you would paint it?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.000
- Well...
- I would pay handsomely.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.270
- I don't have a studio.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.271
- You could come to my house.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.606
How about tomorrow morning?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.609
- You said that
you would pay well?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.077
- Absolutely.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.012
- All right, then.
You have yourself a painter.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.149
Fabulous.
(chuckling)

15:22.689 --> 15:24.522
- Have you found
anything else, miss hart?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.090
- I ascertained that
time of death

15:26.159 --> 15:28.426
Was approximately
nine o'clock that morning.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.094
- So not miss carr;

15:30.229 --> 15:33.164
She was seen in the library
the entire morning.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.832
- Mm.
- Oh.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.502
Mr. Peruggia.
How can I help you?

15:37.637 --> 15:40.438
- I was, uh, told you
have my match case.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.441
- Ah, yes. It's being held
for you at the front desk.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.309
<i> - Grazie.</i>

15:45.312 --> 15:46.643
Oh,<i> dio</i> !

15:46.680 --> 15:49.046
Is that... A dead man?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.581
- It is.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.751
That's mr. Martine.
You knew him.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.056
- Of course. I-I-I did not
recognize him

15:59.092 --> 16:01.926
After his soul departed.
(chuckling nervously)

16:05.632 --> 16:07.465
- Well, uh, have a good day.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.668
- Oh! Of course.<i> Arrivederci.</i>

16:11.871 --> 16:14.539
(soft mysterious music)

16:15.775 --> 16:16.674
- It's strange.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.841
(door opens)

16:17.877 --> 16:18.643
- What is?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.011
- He knew mr. Martine

16:20.080 --> 16:21.678
And didn't recognize him.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.382
- Very few of us
look the same in death.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.086
- I feel I must warn you,

16:29.122 --> 16:31.622
My brushwork is bold
and expressive.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.957
- Oh!

16:33.026 --> 16:34.759
- You've heard
of the fauvist style?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.427
- Ah, no.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.763
- Mm. It means you and your baby

16:38.898 --> 16:41.565
Won't look pretty as you would
in, say, a fragonard.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.300
- Oh!
(laughs nervously)

16:43.336 --> 16:44.502
- When you told me
it was your husband

16:44.637 --> 16:46.904
Who had accused me of murder,
I did think twice.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.774
- Oh, well, he was just
pursuing his investigation.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.076
- And being a foolish man
in the process.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.381
- So, did you have any idea
that mr. Martine

16:56.516 --> 16:58.516
Could have stolen the mona lisa?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.117
- Not at all.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.254
Your husband didn't ask you
to question me, did he?

17:03.323 --> 17:06.190
- Oh! Of course not.
No, I was just curious.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.860
- I bet it was that
lady isabelle

17:08.862 --> 17:11.529
Who told your husband
to suspect me.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.597
No, I just remembered something.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.333
But I don't want to gossip.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.569
- Oh! You can tell me.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.876
- She seemed very chummy
with mr. Martine.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.480
I overheard her saying something
about money being no object.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.616
And then she asked him

17:31.751 --> 17:33.217
When she could
come to his cabin.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.887
- Do you think they were
talking about the painting?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.054
- Possibly.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.757
Or...

17:39.892 --> 17:41.291
She was taking lessons.

17:41.327 --> 17:45.029
Her work is uneven, at best.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.899
- Here she is, dr. Ogden.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.300
Fresh as a daisy.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.604
- Thank you. Hello, darling.
Are you ready?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.139
(susannah coos)

17:58.010 --> 17:59.510
Aww.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.913
- A little to your left.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.581
- Oh.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.651
- You still tinkering
with that contraption?

18:08.922 --> 18:11.055
- The shards of mirror found
in the victim's wounds

18:11.190 --> 18:13.658
Match this broken mirror here.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.260
But it's curious.
- How so?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.729
- This is a front-surface
mirror,

18:18.731 --> 18:22.066
The type of thing used
for a reflective telescope.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.334
- Whatever the murder weapon is,

18:23.469 --> 18:25.803
We need to find that bloody
painting as quick as possible.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.305
Whoever has it,
is most likely our killer.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.273
- Watts called earlier.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.208
He's following a lead
to a hotel.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.277
- I just may have some
information, as well.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.746
- What've you heard?
- Miss isabelle was overheard

18:35.748 --> 18:39.216
Talking to mr. Martine about
purchasing something expensive.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.952
- Overheard by whom?

18:41.087 --> 18:43.087
- Miss emily carr.
- You talked to her?

18:43.222 --> 18:46.624
- Uh, she's painting a portrait
of myself and susannah.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.427
- Oh. Why don't you two
go and talk to the lady?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.828
And tread carefully.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.563
We don't want
an international incident.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.900
(light music)

18:55.902 --> 18:57.101
(indistinct chatter)

18:57.170 --> 18:58.870
(knocking on door)

19:01.908 --> 19:03.841
- Hello! Lady isabelle?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.909
- It's all right, maxine.
You can let them in.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.179
- We just have a few questions.

19:08.181 --> 19:12.116
- I am just off to my show.
Can't talk, I'm afraid.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.051
- Well, this shouldn't
take too long.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.520
- We're investigating a possible
exchange of money

19:16.589 --> 19:18.723
Between you and mr. Martine.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.394
- I loathe discussing money.
It's so vulgar.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.128
- What a lovely tapestry.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.530
- Oh, please don't!

19:32.405 --> 19:36.140
- The mona lisa will not
be returned to you.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.409
It is evidence
in a murder investigation.

19:38.544 --> 19:41.144
- But I gave that poor man
2,000 pounds for it

19:41.181 --> 19:42.346
The day before he died.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.882
- Why did you not
tell me about this?

19:47.053 --> 19:49.620
- I couldn't say I spent
that money in front of papa.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.357
He says I spend
far too much on art.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.660
- It's stolen property.
- I know.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.995
I couldn't resist.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.432
- We believe mr. Martine
was killed for that painting.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.601
- I didn't kill him!

20:04.637 --> 20:05.969
I couldn't have!

20:06.005 --> 20:07.772
Please, you must believe me!

20:07.907 --> 20:10.508
- Do you have any proof
of your purchase?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.109
A receipt,

20:12.145 --> 20:13.711
A letter,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.079
Witness?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.717
- You've put lady isabelle
in the cells?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.885
- She was in possession
of the mona lisa.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.188
- Do you really think
she killed the frenchman?

20:24.190 --> 20:25.522
- That remains to be seen.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.892
She claims she purchased it
from mr. Martine

20:28.027 --> 20:30.861
The day before he died,
but has no proof.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.596
- If she bought
a stolen painting,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.131
What was she thinking?

20:34.133 --> 20:36.934
- That she is a lady
from a wealthy family

20:37.003 --> 20:38.602
And above the law.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.739
- Look at that satisfied smile.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.807
She's obviously
been up to no good.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.144
- It's an interesting painting.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.080
- Interesting?
Murdoch, look at it.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.215
The subtle brushstrokes,

20:52.252 --> 20:55.086
The way the light
dances across her eyes,

20:55.221 --> 20:57.621
The sfumato technique.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.356
- The what?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.058
- Sfumato.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.426
Layers of thin glaze

21:02.495 --> 21:04.095
That create those smoky shadows.

21:04.964 --> 21:05.896
It's beautiful.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.498
- What's beautiful?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.699
- We found the mona lisa.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.434
- That's impossible.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.602
- Why do you say that?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.105
- Because I've just found her.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.179
- Where on earth
did you get this?

21:22.248 --> 21:23.981
- Remember when I told you
I had a lead

21:23.983 --> 21:27.284
On a possible suspect
at the park embassy hotel?

21:28.587 --> 21:29.920
- You got a painting
of the mona lisa from a hotel?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.421
- Yes.
- So where's the person

21:31.457 --> 21:32.856
Who had it?
Did you bring them in?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.525
- No.
- Bloody hell, watts!

21:34.594 --> 21:35.693
The person who had it

21:35.828 --> 21:37.295
Is more than likely
mr. Martine's killer!

21:37.430 --> 21:39.730
- I found the mona lisa
with the person who bought it.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.932
I was too late
to apprehend the seller.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.469
- Talk us through
precisely what happened.

21:46.605 --> 21:47.538
<i> (watts): I was told</i>
<i> that mr. Raphael,</i>

21:47.673 --> 21:50.807
<i> Likely not his real name,</i>
<i> was in room 312.</i>

21:50.843 --> 21:52.109
<i> I knocked on the door.</i>

21:53.313 --> 21:54.945
(man): Is that room service?

21:55.014 --> 21:58.883
- No. Uh, please open the door.
I'm interested in a painting.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.754
(man): You're too late.
Please leave.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.857
<i> (watts): But then, I spotted</i>
<i> the man with the service cart.</i>

22:08.695 --> 22:11.128
(curious music)

22:18.637 --> 22:20.771
<i> Commandeered the cart</i>
<i> and knocked again.</i>

22:21.808 --> 22:23.039
Room service.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.475
(man): Come in.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.646
<i> - The door opened,</i>
<i> and I went inside.</i>

22:30.283 --> 22:31.982
Your champagne.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.385
- Wonderful.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.822
I wanted to drink a toast...

22:38.891 --> 22:40.524
To a beautiful lady.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.659
- Well, that will have to wait.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.528
- Excuse me?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.329
- Toronto constabulary.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.531
I'm detective llewellyn watts

22:47.600 --> 22:50.934
And I'm placing you under arrest
for murder and theft.

22:52.672 --> 22:56.607
- But I bought the mona lisa.
I didn't kill anyone for her.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.275
- Prove it.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.544
<i> (watts): The man told me</i>
<i> he entered the hotel room</i>

23:00.679 --> 23:02.479
<i> And saw the painting.</i>

23:04.751 --> 23:07.418
<i> He then was spoken to</i>
<i> by a man behind a screen.</i>

23:07.553 --> 23:09.353
- Leave five thousand dollars
on the table

23:09.355 --> 23:10.821
And turn to face the wall.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.303
<i> (watts): The man did</i>
<i> what he was told.</i>

23:26.305 --> 23:28.238
<i> When he heard the door shut,</i>
<i> he turned...</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:31.575
And thus he had bought
the mona lisa.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.777
He never saw the seller's face.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.512
- So which one is real?

23:36.382 --> 23:39.717
- Well, they appear identical.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.790
- That's what this device
is used for.

23:46.793 --> 23:47.925
- Yes, what is that?

23:48.060 --> 23:51.128
- Well, I-I don't know
the name, but if you peer...

23:51.130 --> 23:52.229
Yes!

23:53.199 --> 23:54.731
- Peer through the top.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.301
Can you see the reflection
of the painting?

23:57.370 --> 23:58.936
- The mirror's half-broken,
but yes.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.338
If I look down on it,
I can see it.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.374
- That's what mr. Martine
was doing aboard the ship.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.144
He had the real mona lisa
and used this device

24:07.146 --> 24:09.346
To help him make a copy.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.815
- Oh! What he used to aid him

24:11.851 --> 24:14.084
Ended up being used to kill him.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.219
- Poetry aside,

24:15.354 --> 24:17.154
We still don't know
who swung the bloody thing.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.023
- We still have lady isabelle
in our custody.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.925
- So if she had the fake,
it's more than likely

24:21.961 --> 24:23.294
That she's telling the truth,
that she bought it

24:23.429 --> 24:25.095
Off mr. Martine.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.464
So, the killer sold
the real one for more money.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.234
- The question is...

24:32.037 --> 24:33.370
Which is which?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.241
(indistinct chatter)

24:40.813 --> 24:42.312
- Ah. Good morning, sir.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.515
I've already been
to the park embassy hotel,

24:44.517 --> 24:46.383
But neither the clerk
nor any of the bellboys

24:46.452 --> 24:48.118
Can remember what
mr. Raphael looked like.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.521
- Ah. Very well, henry.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.656
Could you keep an eye out
for a telegram for me?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.258
- Of course.
May I ask what it's about?

24:54.393 --> 24:56.726
- I've asked the louvre
to send any and all information

24:56.762 --> 24:58.194
That will help us discern

24:58.231 --> 24:59.997
The real mona lisa
from the fake.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.332
- Ah.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.068
Does it really matter, sir?

25:04.971 --> 25:06.003
- What do you mean?

25:07.339 --> 25:10.073
- If they look identical,
I say the more the merrier.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.810
- I'm not sure the louvre
would share your sentiments.

25:13.846 --> 25:14.945
- Yeah.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.280
Of course.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.350
- Nanny is just changing
susannah.

25:19.485 --> 25:20.618
(carr sighs)

25:20.753 --> 25:22.452
Oh! Well, it shouldn't
take too long.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.087
- No, it's not that. I just...

25:24.156 --> 25:25.455
I can't...

25:25.525 --> 25:29.225
I was painting so freely
in paris and now...

25:29.262 --> 25:30.995
- Oh! Well, I'm sure
it's wonderful.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.062
May I take a look?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.099
Oh!

25:35.234 --> 25:39.403
Oh, well, I see. Yeah, well,
it's-it's very colourful.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.506
- Damned by faint praise.
- I love it, truly.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.643
- No, you don't.
It's insipid and muddy.

25:45.645 --> 25:49.846
- Nonsense. You have
such a-a... Free style.

25:49.848 --> 25:53.050
- Even that police inspector
painted better.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.718
- No.
- I'm wasting my life.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.921
- No! I'm n-not!

25:57.056 --> 25:58.589
You're ruining it!
You're ruining it!

25:58.724 --> 26:02.125
- You can't ruin something
that was never anything.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.460
(clatters)

26:06.499 --> 26:07.531
(sighs)

26:08.534 --> 26:10.801
- To think of a rawley
tossed into jail

26:10.870 --> 26:12.402
Like a common criminal.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.205
No one can ever know of this.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.007
- Is that really
all you care about?

26:17.142 --> 26:19.242
How it reflects on the family?

26:19.312 --> 26:20.410
I am your daughter!

26:20.479 --> 26:21.545
(brackenreid clears throat)

26:21.547 --> 26:22.579
- If I may?

26:22.714 --> 26:24.081
We'd like to discuss the case.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.016
- Oh, this case is a farce.

26:26.052 --> 26:29.620
Do you really believe
lady isabelle killed a man?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.822
- There's been a development.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.158
- Go on, then.
- We now have in our possession

26:35.194 --> 26:37.294
Two mona lisas,

26:37.429 --> 26:39.697
The original and a copy.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.698
If your daughter had the copy,

26:41.734 --> 26:44.568
Then it is possible she
purchased it from mr. Martine.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.870
- I told you I...

26:46.872 --> 26:48.672
No, wait, that's impossible.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.240
I couldn't have bought
a mere copy.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.976
- If you had the real mona lisa,

26:53.045 --> 26:54.845
It might appear that
you had killed for it.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.046
- This is ridiculous.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.549
Neither of them
is the real painting.

26:58.551 --> 27:00.183
- How do you know that?

27:00.252 --> 27:02.586
- My secretary told me
just this morning

27:02.721 --> 27:04.921
That he heard j.P. Morgan

27:04.923 --> 27:07.190
Was approached by a seller
looking to quietly

27:07.226 --> 27:08.325
Sell the mona lisa.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.528
- How does your secretary
know this?

27:11.597 --> 27:14.665
- His cousin is j.P. Morgan's
art agent.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.200
The seller told mr. Morgan

27:16.335 --> 27:19.403
The sale must happen
quickly in toronto.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.538
I had planned to tell you.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.374
- That is very interesting.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.444
- I assume the arrest
of my daughter

27:27.480 --> 27:29.346
Won't be in any of the papers.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.148
- You have our word.

27:32.284 --> 27:35.953
- We'll just be needing
one more thing from you.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.020
(rawley sighs)

27:37.957 --> 27:39.189
- What's your plan?

27:40.026 --> 27:42.192
- Draw the seller out.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.161
I had the duke
call his secretary

27:44.230 --> 27:46.163
And get me the details
of the person

27:46.165 --> 27:47.831
Who contacted mr. Morgan.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.299
- So we can contact him?

27:49.301 --> 27:52.769
- Yes. Now, he sold
the first quickly

27:52.905 --> 27:54.671
And for relatively little money.

27:55.874 --> 27:59.243
But for this one,
he went to mr. J.P. Morgan.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.144
- Who I've heard pays
hundreds of thousands

28:01.213 --> 28:02.979
For a painting by an old master.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.848
- So this could be the real one.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.583
And, therefore,
the person selling it...

28:06.619 --> 28:08.218
- Is likely our killer.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.789
I just want to say right now:

28:12.858 --> 28:14.791
I'm not pretending
to be j.P. Morgan.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.260
- But, sir.
- Not today, murdoch.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.697
I'm just not feeling
in a thespian mood.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.466
I'll be out front chasing
him down if he runs off.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.669
- Huh. As you wish.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.206
- So, who is going
to be mr. Morgan?

28:32.144 --> 28:34.578
(curious music)

28:38.584 --> 28:39.883
Are you sure?

28:41.187 --> 28:42.452
- He's done it before.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.161
Henry, I've contacted
the seller.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.029
You are to go
to the park embassy hotel

28:53.065 --> 28:54.598
Tomorrow morning at eight am.

28:55.468 --> 28:56.833
- Who am I pretending to be?

28:56.869 --> 29:00.104
- Well, you're far too young
to play mr. J.P. Morgan,

29:00.239 --> 29:03.740
So I've created a buyer,
a friend of mr. Morgan's.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.376
- So a rich man, you say.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.711
- I suppose.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.881
- I'll be needing a new suit.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.120
- Was the new suit
really necessary?

29:17.123 --> 29:20.524
- Sir, pierpont is worth
over 80 million dollars.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.259
I need to look like
his representative.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.393
- And what's that?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.495
- Oh! Pierpont is fond
of cigars.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.729
Thought I would partake.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.298
- The hat looks ridiculous.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.402
- Ruthie bought it for me.
- Lose it! Give.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.471
Now go in there and see
if he's got the bloody painting.

29:35.508 --> 29:38.342
- Right. Uh, how much
should I offer for it?

29:39.812 --> 29:42.613
- As much as you want, henry.
We aren't actually buying it.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.115
- Oh. Of course.
(chuckles)

29:46.251 --> 29:48.085
Not sure I approve
of this plan of action.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.820
- It's the best one we have.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.292
(knocking on door)

29:55.361 --> 29:57.828
(coughs)
- yes. Hello. Enter.

30:03.702 --> 30:04.635
- What's your name?

30:04.770 --> 30:07.204
- Mr. Reginald templeton.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.373
- Are you a copper?

30:10.409 --> 30:11.641
(coughing)

30:11.677 --> 30:13.243
- Don't be absurd!

30:14.380 --> 30:16.580
Do I look like an uneducated
ruffian to you?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.053
- What's going on?

30:23.789 --> 30:25.022
- He's signalling.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.391
That man!

30:27.393 --> 30:28.592
- He's using him as a lookout.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.393
- Toronto constabulary! Stop!

30:33.098 --> 30:34.397
- What're you doing?

30:36.502 --> 30:37.467
- Nice suit.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.404
Too bad about the shoes, copper.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.610
(tense music)

30:47.679 --> 30:49.279
- Police! Stop!

30:51.650 --> 30:54.050
(panting)

31:00.726 --> 31:01.625
(grunts)

31:01.694 --> 31:02.692
Stop!

31:03.829 --> 31:05.095
(tires screeching)

31:05.097 --> 31:06.229
(grunts)

31:07.633 --> 31:09.599
(panting)

31:12.638 --> 31:14.037
- Seems like he got away, sir.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.107
- Get that suit back
to where you got it from.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.575
- Really? I--
- now!

31:19.612 --> 31:22.512
(panting)

31:34.326 --> 31:36.126
- There are several
paintings here.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.031
A landscape...

31:42.801 --> 31:44.734
A still life,

31:44.770 --> 31:47.804
Both signed jm. Jacques martine.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.539
- The killer didn't just
steal the mona lisa.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.474
They stole all
mr. Martine's paintings.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.276
(gasps)
and there she is.

31:54.613 --> 31:58.081
- A third mona lisa?
Will wonders never cease?

31:59.351 --> 32:00.950
- This is most likely
the real one.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.220
- Huh. It makes one ponder:

32:03.222 --> 32:06.089
If we cannot distinguish
between the real and the fake,

32:06.158 --> 32:08.624
Why reject the forgeries
as inferior?

32:08.661 --> 32:11.161
- Because one is worth
a fortune, and one isn't.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.263
- But consider a lithograph,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.766
Or a piece of music,
or a choreographed dance.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.902
They are repeated
and each iteration

32:18.904 --> 32:20.636
Is considered a work of art.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.506
- Yes, but in each
of those examples,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.475
Repetition is inherent
in the creation.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.512
A forgery of a painting
is intentionally deceitful.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.013
- Mm.
- He's got you there.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.147
- Well, no. I agree.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.116
The intent with which
these were made is different,

32:33.185 --> 32:34.917
But if we cannot
tell them apart,

32:34.954 --> 32:37.120
We simply enjoy them all.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.122
Therefore, is authenticity
relevant

32:39.191 --> 32:41.391
To one's aesthetic experience?

32:41.427 --> 32:42.992
- It's relevant
to what it's worth.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.594
- Why?

32:44.596 --> 32:47.264
- Because it just bloody is!
That's why.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.999
- Sir, if I may?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.036
Does this man look familiar?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.672
- It's the cabin steward,
henri dubois.

32:56.709 --> 32:57.874
The one who found the victim.

32:58.010 --> 33:01.010
- It's signed jm, 1910.

33:01.046 --> 33:04.080
- How did mr. Martine paint
the cabin steward last year?

33:04.149 --> 33:05.549
Did they know each other?

33:05.684 --> 33:08.351
- This is not a portrait
of henri dubois.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.087
This is a self-portrait

33:11.156 --> 33:12.889
Of jacques martine.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.958
- Bloody hell.
We've been tricked.

33:15.027 --> 33:18.761
- Why would mr. Martine
switch identities with dubois?

33:18.797 --> 33:23.233
- Because martine was wanted
for the theft of the mona lisa.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.402
Better to be declared dead
than to be chased

33:25.471 --> 33:27.570
By the french police
the rest of your life.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.105
- Have this image printed,
murdoch,

33:29.241 --> 33:30.374
And have it distributed
everywhere.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.509
- He's likely planning
to leave toronto.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.646
- Oh! Detective murdoch!

33:36.682 --> 33:39.516
(laughing)
- oh. Mr. Peruggia,

33:39.651 --> 33:41.451
Have you not retrieved
your match case yet?

33:41.487 --> 33:44.387
- Oh, y-yes and I wanted
to thank you again for that.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.923
- Ah. You're welcome.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.259
Good day.
- Oh.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.929
I overheard that you found
the mona lisa. I am so happy.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.198
- Yes, we actually
have three now.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.000
We believe one
to be the original.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.334
- You don't know?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.337
- Well, I have an idea.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.606
- No. A true lover
of la gioconda would know.

34:05.010 --> 34:07.944
- Yes. How would one
know for certain?

34:08.013 --> 34:10.947
- Ah. One could hear
her calling to you

34:11.016 --> 34:13.350
Through the ages in<i> italiano.</i>

34:15.220 --> 34:17.287
- Anything more concrete
than that?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.222
- No.

34:20.959 --> 34:21.691
- Good day.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.496
(tense music)

34:26.532 --> 34:28.064
(door closes)

34:28.133 --> 34:29.699
(footsteps approaching)

34:30.836 --> 34:32.903
- Have you seen
this chap before?

34:33.038 --> 34:34.304
- Never seen him before.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.172
- I'll take a scotch, please.

34:37.509 --> 34:38.741
Hello, miss carr.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.343
- Oh.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.313
Inspector.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.848
- What's this, then?

34:45.784 --> 34:49.719
- It's nothing.
It's a bad habit.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.389
- I think drawing
is one of my best habits.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.525
- You have talent. I do not.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.727
- Ah. It's not going well.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.329
I know how you feel.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.932
I've thrown many of my paintings
in the fire before.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.800
(chuckling)
- hm.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.604
I tried painting a portrait
of a mother and her baby.

35:07.673 --> 35:11.675
Heaven knows I need the money,
but it never came alive.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.677
- Maybe you're not
a portrait painter.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.680
It can be quite inhibiting
trying to paint real people,

35:16.815 --> 35:19.315
Especially when you have
to flatter them. May I?

35:27.259 --> 35:28.824
- It's a...

35:28.861 --> 35:31.561
It's a church out
in british columbia.

35:32.430 --> 35:35.798
It's in a thick forest.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.702
It's so beautiful there.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.373
- You should go out west,

35:43.375 --> 35:45.475
Paint outside amongst nature.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.846
Paint what you love and paint
how you want to paint it.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.048
- Do you think it's that simple?

35:52.184 --> 35:54.250
(laughing)
- no, not at all.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.520
- And if I fail?

35:57.556 --> 35:59.722
- Then you fail doing something
that you love.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.457
Better that than
the alternative.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.593
- How so?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.030
- Well, you'd spend time doing
something that you enjoyed.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.200
The end result doesn't
really matter then, does it?

36:12.137 --> 36:14.404
- I do long
for british columbia.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.543
Thank you, inspector.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.945
- Can I keep this?

36:23.815 --> 36:25.748
- It's worthless.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.550
- Not if I like it, it isn't.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.291
- Will you be paying
for the lady?

36:35.427 --> 36:36.292
(door closes)

36:37.829 --> 36:39.829
- Bloody artists.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.297
- Probably starving.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.299
(chuckling)

36:54.213 --> 36:55.778
- Excuse me, sir! A moment.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.180
- I'm in something of a hurry.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.149
- Oh. Paintings to sell, is it?

36:59.952 --> 37:01.985
(grunting)

37:08.393 --> 37:09.726
- It's quite a good likeness.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.728
- Indeed.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.996
I suppose it would be
worth more

37:13.131 --> 37:15.065
Now that the artist is dead.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.867
- Enough with the charade.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.069
I know it's a self-portrait.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.739
- Ah.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.111
- You killed an innocent
cabin steward.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.883
- He saw my paintings.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.918
- Yes, your paintings.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.589
You are uniquely talented.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.661
Why turn to forgery and murder?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.497
- My original work
was called derivative.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.766
Old-fashioned.

37:50.902 --> 37:54.770
So I figured perhaps
originality is overrated.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.372
Perhaps I could make
more mona lisas

37:56.508 --> 37:57.507
For the world to enjoy.

37:57.642 --> 38:01.244
- You didn't paint them
for edification.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.846
You made them for profit.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.281
- You think so little of me,
detective.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.051
- You killed mr. Dubois
and assumed his identity

38:08.186 --> 38:10.320
So that you could
sell the paintings.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.690
You had to have known
that the authorities

38:13.825 --> 38:15.358
Would be looking
for the mona lisa.

38:17.162 --> 38:17.994
- Perhaps.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.597
- You weren't just trying
to throw

38:21.667 --> 38:23.099
The police off your trail.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.801
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.073
- You were working
with someone else.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.408
And if they also believed
that you were dead,

38:32.444 --> 38:34.210
You would be free
to sell the paintings

38:34.246 --> 38:36.346
And keep all of the profit.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.349
- If it was my plan,

38:39.418 --> 38:40.483
It isn't anymore.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.353
I've changed my mind
about the mona lisa.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.556
It's not just about the money,
detective.

38:47.892 --> 38:52.562
- Oh. Then please tell me
what it is about, mr. Martine.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.165
- Maybe I had a partner.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.035
But I won't give you his name.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.905
If I can't have her,
why shouldn't he?

39:02.941 --> 39:06.275
(suspenseful music)

39:09.648 --> 39:12.415
- A true lover
of la gioconda would know.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.852
- You don't have to give me
his name.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.789
I know who it is.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.557
Mr. Vincenzo peruggia.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.130
(door opens and closes)

39:31.269 --> 39:32.402
Henry!

39:33.405 --> 39:34.737
- Yes, sir.
- There are only

39:34.740 --> 39:36.406
Two paintings here.
Where's the third?

39:36.475 --> 39:38.274
- I... Don't know, sir.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.009
- And where is mr. Peruggia?

39:40.145 --> 39:41.878
- The italian man?
I haven't seen him around.

39:43.248 --> 39:46.215
- He must've known which one
was the original and taken it.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.884
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.219
Alert the border crossings.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.955
He's likely leaving the country
and headed to europe.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.156
- Right away.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.359
(sighs)

39:56.494 --> 39:59.061
(curious music)

40:01.500 --> 40:02.832
- For a brief moment in time,

40:02.967 --> 40:05.301
Da vinci's masterpiece
was in toronto.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.303
- It's probably long gone
by now.

40:07.439 --> 40:10.039
There's been no sightings
of that mr. Peruggia anywhere.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.975
- He's likely on a ship
or a train

40:12.110 --> 40:13.977
Traveling under a false name.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.913
- False names, a false body,

40:16.915 --> 40:18.848
False paintings.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.716
- I've been thinking
about what you said, watts.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.784
- Oh?

40:21.820 --> 40:24.053
- About the aesthetic
experience.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.589
I think a fake mona lisa
is good enough for me.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.792
If you don't mind, murdoch,
I think I'll take one home.

40:29.795 --> 40:30.860
- Of course.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.595
- Give margaret something
to crow about.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.198
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.932
No, I'll take this one.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.401
Good night, gentlemen.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.872
- Oh, I don't trust her smile.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.406
- Hm.

40:44.443 --> 40:47.009
(mysterious music)

40:58.356 --> 41:00.857
You could try
to find another artist.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.159
- I've had two failed attempts
at a portrait.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.695
I'm beginning to think
that I'm cursed.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.565
- You could paint it yourself!

41:09.601 --> 41:12.235
From this photograph
I took of you.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.970
(chuckling)

41:14.039 --> 41:16.306
- Hm. Oh, no, william.
I've tried painting a few times

41:16.308 --> 41:18.307
With no great success.
I find it so hard

41:18.343 --> 41:20.443
To get the proportions right.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.379
- Well, then, come with me.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.519
- What is this?

41:29.521 --> 41:31.988
- It's called a camera lucida

41:31.990 --> 41:35.758
And you peer through it
like this. And...

41:38.329 --> 41:40.429
- Oh! I can see the photograph.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.865
- Yes! It allows you
to perfectly

41:42.934 --> 41:44.601
Duplicate the proportions.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.868
- Ha!

41:47.138 --> 41:47.904
Oh!

41:49.774 --> 41:50.940
You know, william,

41:51.075 --> 41:52.875
I really wish I came
to the office

41:52.878 --> 41:55.612
To see the real mona lisa.
Was she very beautiful?

41:55.614 --> 41:58.081
(sighs)
- I had the original

41:58.083 --> 41:59.549
And the copies

41:59.684 --> 42:01.350
And, to be honest,

42:01.419 --> 42:03.485
I couldn't tell the difference.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.421
- Oh! Well, I do hope

42:05.423 --> 42:07.090
The louvre recovers
the true one.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.358
- No doubt they will.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.360
- Thank you, william.

42:11.396 --> 42:14.364
- I bought you these
new colours, as well.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.765
- Oh, huh.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.701
- Ochre. Apparently,
that's very popular these days.

42:18.703 --> 42:19.802
- Oh, right.

42:20.705 --> 42:23.072
- Ah, ha, ha. What is that?

42:24.109 --> 42:26.241
- It's a painting.
What's it look like?

42:26.278 --> 42:28.244
- Well, where did you get it?

42:28.313 --> 42:29.512
- Do you know what this is?

42:30.315 --> 42:31.847
(sighs)

42:31.883 --> 42:34.250
- It's the mona lisa
by leonardo da vinci.

42:34.319 --> 42:36.052
Well, a bloody
good copy, anyway.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.720
- A copy?
- Aye.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.989
(scoffs)
- I don't want a copy

42:40.058 --> 42:42.257
Of a painting sitting
on our mantle.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.593
It's common.
- Margaret!

42:43.728 --> 42:44.927
- Besides...

42:44.996 --> 42:47.563
It's like her eyes
seem to follow me

42:47.566 --> 42:50.533
Everywhere I go.
Mm, I don't like it.

42:50.668 --> 42:53.469
- Well, I do. And she's staying.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.204
(scoffs)

42:55.340 --> 42:57.740
(chuckling)
- uh-huh.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.609
(sighs)

42:59.744 --> 43:00.944
Ah, no.

43:03.181 --> 43:06.215
I don't... What's so
special about you?
