00:02.075 --> 00:04.908
I gotta tell you-

00:04.995 --> 00:07.554
If I could just have everybody's
attention real quick.

00:07.634 --> 00:10.195
Um, on this wonderful
occasion-

00:10.355 --> 00:13.235
our daughter leaving tomorrow for college
- Oh!

00:13.316 --> 00:15.831
If I could get everyone
to raise their glass.

00:15.915 --> 00:19.796
As I quote from one of our
nation's great fathers-Jefferson.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.753
George Jefferson.

00:21.835 --> 00:24.352
"I never dreamed that one of my own
would be going off to a university,

00:24.437 --> 00:26.393
but here I stand,
a proud black man,

00:26.477 --> 00:28.513
knowing that all those hours
I put in at the dry cleaner"-

00:28.597 --> 00:31.396
- Phil.
- Not now, Weezy. Where was I?

00:31.477 --> 00:32.990
Quoting that president.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.511
Okay, If she's
the future of America,

00:34.597 --> 00:36.158
we should start using
Chinese money now.

00:36.197 --> 00:37.676
We already are.

00:37.756 --> 00:39.714
My arm is tired.
To Haley.

00:39.797 --> 00:41.357
To Haley!

00:41.437 --> 00:43.555
And before everyone
puts their glasses down,

00:43.638 --> 00:45.674
uh, we're also
very proud of Lily.

00:45.757 --> 00:48.477
Tomorrow is her first day
of kindergarten.

00:48.558 --> 00:50.867
To Lily. Oh, Lily.

00:50.958 --> 00:52.638
To Lily. And you'll
be impressed to know...

00:52.717 --> 00:54.757
that she's gonna be one
of the smartest girls there.

00:54.798 --> 00:57.438
Lily, sweetie, what's the
square root of 64? Eight.

00:57.519 --> 00:59.397
- Hey!
- Nice trick.

00:59.478 --> 01:01.788
Hey, Lily, what's the
square root of this potato?

01:01.879 --> 01:04.348
- Eight.
- Congratulations. You have a parrot.

01:06.518 --> 01:10.149
We couldn't even get through the toast to
Haley before you pulled focus to Lily.

01:10.238 --> 01:13.039
Oh, come on. It's-It's a big
day for both of them, huh?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.076
Haley going to college
is a miracle.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.072
Lily going to kindergarten
is the law.

01:17.159 --> 01:21.073
Well, Haley and Lily aren't
the only ones starting school.

01:21.159 --> 01:23.549
My mom and Jay are going
to parenting class.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.032
We're doing it for the baby.
Not this baby. That baby.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.874
Manny doesn't believe
that we know what we're doing.

01:29.961 --> 01:31.838
A couple of new hairs
under his arm,

01:31.921 --> 01:34.277
and now he thinks he knows more
than his own mother.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.201
I know not to embarrass my son as he
stands on the threshold of manhood.

01:37.241 --> 01:39.073
I don't know why
I have to go to this thing.

01:39.201 --> 01:40.954
In case you've forgotten,
I raised two kids.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.522
Ow!
Ow! Ow!

01:42.642 --> 01:44.474
Stop pulling my hair.
Stop twisting my nipple.

01:44.601 --> 01:46.833
Shut up. Shut up.
Ow!

01:46.962 --> 01:49.272
Why look at me?
It was their mother's fault.

01:49.361 --> 01:50.875
I was barely around.

01:50.962 --> 01:52.600
No! O-Ow!

01:53.881 --> 01:54.630
Hey, hey

01:55.002 --> 01:58.076
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

02:01.962 --> 02:03.158
Hey

02:05.882 --> 02:08.875
Haley, this is, like, the third bag
of makeup and hair care products.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.432
Dad, if you want me to get good
grades, I have to look cute.

02:11.563 --> 02:13.794
Don't say a word. No. No. I
agree with that premise.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.603
Thank you. Wait.

02:16.684 --> 02:18.357
Yeah, thank you.

02:20.684 --> 02:22.163
Claire.
Mm-hmm?

02:22.244 --> 02:24.554
In Haley's stuff,
there's a box of condoms.

02:24.643 --> 02:27.034
Yeah. Um, I-I bought
those for her.

02:27.124 --> 02:31.198
What? Why don't you just buy her some
fishnet stockings and a nurse's outfit?

02:31.285 --> 02:33.595
Not that that's my thing.
That just popped into my head.

02:33.685 --> 02:35.721
Honey, she's an adult,
and she's going to college.

02:35.845 --> 02:38.757
I want to be realistic. I don't
want her to get caught unprepared.

02:38.845 --> 02:41.405
Twenty-four times? What, are you
buying her a four-year supply?

02:41.484 --> 02:44.406
Please, Phil. That would've
lasted me and my college boyfriend-

02:44.445 --> 02:47.200
Ah! La, la, la,
la, la, la!

02:47.286 --> 02:49.402
Okay, we gotta hit the road.

02:49.526 --> 02:51.518
Give your sister
a hug good-bye.

02:53.085 --> 02:56.123
Don't dork up our room.
Don't slut up your college.

02:56.806 --> 02:57.955
Hmm.

02:59.765 --> 03:02.521
Seriously, though,
don't study too hard, okay?

03:02.606 --> 03:04.360
I'm totally going to have fun.

03:04.446 --> 03:06.837
I'm Iceland
in the mock U.N.

03:06.926 --> 03:08.599
Mom, we're gonna lose her.

03:08.687 --> 03:10.997
I am doing my best.

03:11.087 --> 03:12.964
Luke, come say good-bye
to your sister.

03:13.046 --> 03:15.688
I'm right here.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.044
Bye, Haley. Have fun.

03:18.128 --> 03:20.119
Don't drink too much beer
and shots of tequila.

03:20.207 --> 03:21.846
Why are you wearing that mask?

03:21.928 --> 03:23.839
Uh, I like it.

03:23.928 --> 03:25.681
He doesn't want you
to see him cry.

03:25.808 --> 03:28.004
He's literally masking
his emotions. No!

03:28.087 --> 03:29.885
That's so sweet.
Come here.

03:29.968 --> 03:32.483
It's not sweet.
I'm an evil cyborg.

03:32.569 --> 03:35.720
Half my face was burned off
in an industrial accident,

03:35.809 --> 03:38.404
and the mask is hiding the
servos that control my mouth.

03:38.488 --> 03:40.082
Oh!
Oh!

03:40.168 --> 03:42.684
Yes, I am sad Haley is leaving,

03:42.768 --> 03:45.488
but I'm gonna be okay, knowing
I've done everything I can...

03:45.569 --> 03:49.722
to get her set up and prepared
and off on the right foot.

03:49.810 --> 03:51.038
Not me.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.209
When we're standing in her
dorm room saying good-bye,

03:53.250 --> 03:56.048
it's gonna be one of the most
emotional moments of my life.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.281
I'm gonna cry harder than
the first time I saw AirBud.

03:58.370 --> 03:59.598
Oh.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.727
Especially when
I give her this.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.285
Phil's-osophy.
Hmm.

04:04.371 --> 04:07.011
A hardbound collection of all
the life lessons I've learned,

04:07.091 --> 04:08.604
such as-

04:11.011 --> 04:13.002
"Always look people in the eye,

04:13.091 --> 04:14.763
even if they're blind.

04:14.851 --> 04:17.922
Just say, 'I'm looking
you in the eye.'"

04:18.011 --> 04:19.968
Or...

04:20.052 --> 04:22.771
"If you get pulled over
for speeding,

04:22.851 --> 04:25.526
tell the policeman
your spouse has diarrhea."

04:29.012 --> 04:30.526
Phil's-osophy.

04:33.211 --> 04:35.363
Look how much fun
you're gonna have here, Lily.

04:35.452 --> 04:37.284
So many great toys
to play with.

04:37.373 --> 04:39.443
And you're gonna make
so many new friends. Oh!

04:39.573 --> 04:41.768
I wish I was in kindergarten again.
Oh, not me.

04:41.853 --> 04:44.412
Did I ever tell you about David Anthony?
He used to call me "Cam the Ham."

04:44.532 --> 04:47.810
Okay, Lily's day. You're right. You know what?
It's gonna be a great day.

04:47.892 --> 04:50.328
I'm just saying, it's difficult to grow
up with a name that rhymes with ham.

04:50.413 --> 04:53.213
Hello? Mitch?
Witch. Twitch.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.330
Bitch.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.247
Elaine Stritch.
What?

04:56.333 --> 04:58.165
Not all bullies are straight.

04:58.293 --> 05:00.091
Okay, parents! Oh!
Okay.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.006
We'll see you at 12:00.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.574
All right. Mmm!

05:03.694 --> 05:05.493
This is when the crying starts.
Mmm!

05:05.575 --> 05:07.726
Does it ever stop?
Come on, Cam.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.613
Okay. You know what,
Lily, sweetie?

05:09.735 --> 05:11.726
I know this is gonna
be difficult-Bye!

05:11.815 --> 05:14.568
Okay. That was a knife
to the heart.

05:14.654 --> 05:17.214
No, it's-it's a good thing.
Come on.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.930
Oh, you know what? She
forgot her snack. Oh.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.087
Where'd
she-Where'd she go?

05:22.176 --> 05:26.169
- Did she go there?
- Ow! That hurts! Ow! That hurts!

05:26.256 --> 05:28.645
Oh, Lily, honey! Sweetheart, come here.
Come here.

05:29.936 --> 05:33.167
If you ever put your hands
on my daughter again,

05:33.256 --> 05:35.655
I will string you up by your
feet, run you up the flagpole...

05:35.696 --> 05:38.495
and let the birds
peck out your eyes.

05:39.257 --> 05:40.452
You understand?

05:40.536 --> 05:42.654
Mr. Tucker,
put that boy down!

05:46.577 --> 05:48.216
He pulled my daughter's hair.

05:48.296 --> 05:49.889
Please apologize to Connor...

05:49.976 --> 05:53.813
for using your hands
instead of your words.

05:53.897 --> 05:55.890
Sorry, little fella.

05:56.058 --> 05:58.049
I would like to see you in my office.
Right.

05:58.138 --> 06:00.936
Now, please.
Me too? Oh.

06:06.818 --> 06:08.093
Caw! Caw!

06:08.179 --> 06:10.648
Stop it.
Leave him alone.

06:15.098 --> 06:17.216
Mr. Tucker, what happened
out there was unacceptable.

06:17.298 --> 06:19.530
I agree. Is this kindergarten
or The Hunger Games?

06:19.619 --> 06:21.338
I'm speaking of your behavior.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.098
We've never had
an incident like this,

06:23.179 --> 06:25.740
and now we've had one on the
first day, before circle time.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.334
What the fudge
were you thinking?

06:27.419 --> 06:29.457
Now the boy's parents are
coming in, and trust me,

06:29.539 --> 06:31.337
they're mad as Hello Kitty.

06:31.419 --> 06:33.810
Oh, you told his parents on us?

06:33.899 --> 06:35.572
That is-
That is so not cool.

06:35.659 --> 06:39.415
Well, I'm sure once they hear what their
boy did, they will be understanding.

06:39.501 --> 06:43.335
All right. Whoever made our son cry
has messed with the wrong moms.

06:44.501 --> 06:46.458
Lesbians.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.771
While often lumped together,
gay men and lesbians...

06:48.861 --> 06:50.818
have less in common
than one might think.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.734
Like in the Venn diagram
of sexual identity,

06:53.861 --> 06:57.060
you have gay men-
And straight men.

06:57.142 --> 06:58.815
Both the same gender.

06:58.942 --> 07:02.094
Then you have gay men-
And straight women.

07:02.182 --> 07:04.776
Both attracted
to the same gender.

07:04.861 --> 07:06.694
But gay men and lesbians?

07:07.382 --> 07:08.337
No.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.690
Nothing.
Yeah.

07:09.781 --> 07:12.217
I am so sorry
we have to meet like this,

07:12.302 --> 07:14.215
but I'm sure you can
understand, as parents,

07:14.302 --> 07:16.294
the instinct
to protect your child.

07:16.383 --> 07:19.023
Yeah, that's what makes me want to
punch you in the neck right now.

07:19.102 --> 07:21.412
Wow. I see where your son
gets all of his aggression.

07:21.503 --> 07:23.335
Okay, let's all
take a time-out.

07:23.422 --> 07:25.379
That's a good idea. This is
getting a little heated. Right?

07:25.462 --> 07:28.343
Yeah, Pam. We don't want another
incident like at the lumberyard.

07:28.423 --> 07:30.983
Oh, my God. You guys go
to The Lumberyard too?

07:31.064 --> 07:32.702
I didn't know
they had a ladies' night.

07:32.783 --> 07:34.536
Not the bar, Sally.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.862
Okay, you know what? He's trying to be
nice, and you just called him Sally.

07:37.944 --> 07:40.095
Yeah, you're not being very
helpful, Peppermint Patty.

07:40.183 --> 07:42.984
- Let's just stick to our actual names.
- Enough.

07:43.065 --> 07:45.181
I'm gonna give you a little
homework assignment.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.063
I want you and your kids
to have a family playdate.

07:48.145 --> 07:49.976
Maybe if the four of you
can get along,

07:50.065 --> 07:52.022
you can set a better example
for your children.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.984
I think that's
a wonderful idea. Pam?

07:55.065 --> 07:56.385
Fine.
Cam?

07:56.505 --> 07:58.622
Fine. We'll host, obviously.
"Obviously"?

07:58.706 --> 08:01.266
Well, I assume you have an unfinished
woodworking project at your house.

08:01.345 --> 08:02.860
You've got a lot of nerve.

08:02.985 --> 08:06.535
Yeah, and you've got half a
canoe in our living room.

08:06.626 --> 08:08.424
I look forward
to your frittata.

08:08.506 --> 08:11.179
Oh. Why, are you
visiting us in 2008?

08:13.267 --> 08:15.702
Yeah.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.301
Thank you.

08:18.507 --> 08:20.339
You have some explaining to do.

08:20.426 --> 08:23.339
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out like this, Jay.

08:24.786 --> 08:26.904
Wow, you two
are really far along.

08:26.986 --> 08:28.900
We're, uh-We're still
on our first trimester.

08:28.987 --> 08:30.626
Ay, that's nice.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.346
Yeah, we've been trying
to get pregnant for ages.

08:32.427 --> 08:35.818
She's Latina. You just
gotta look at her funny.

08:35.907 --> 08:38.946
Okay! Now
that everyone has their doll,

08:39.028 --> 08:40.905
let's talk about swaddling.

08:40.988 --> 08:44.264
Now, you want to start by turning one
corner of the blanket toward you,

08:44.349 --> 08:45.863
like a diamond,

08:45.989 --> 08:49.948
and folding the top down,
like this.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.022
I think they made
a mistake at the hospital.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.422
Tough room.

08:56.509 --> 08:59.422
Now we are going to pull
the other corner round...

08:59.509 --> 09:02.105
and tuck it in nice and snug...

09:02.189 --> 09:03.703
like a burrito.

09:03.789 --> 09:05.986
Done! I win.

09:06.069 --> 09:08.584
- It's not a race.
- Darn right. It wasn't even close.

09:08.669 --> 09:12.380
Oh!

09:12.470 --> 09:15.429
Okay, it's good,
but it's a little tight.

09:15.510 --> 09:18.469
It's a burrito. You don't
want the meat to fall out.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.542
Here.
And try like this.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.221
And see?

09:25.310 --> 09:27.666
Now your baby can breathe.

09:29.271 --> 09:32.821
I wrapped my son with one hand
while driving a stick.

09:32.911 --> 09:36.189
I think I know how to keep a baby safe.

09:39.152 --> 09:40.983
Man, I love being back
in the dorms.

09:41.071 --> 09:43.223
It's like I never left.

09:43.311 --> 09:46.305
Throw up a David Copperfield
poster, this could be my room.

09:46.392 --> 09:48.827
Honey, Haley and I have to
go fill out some paperwork.

09:48.912 --> 09:51.109
Why don't you throw
the linens on the bed?

09:51.233 --> 09:53.303
Oh, and move the car
before they tow us. Okay.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.066
Oh, my God.
What is that shirt?

09:55.153 --> 09:57.383
Pretty sweet, huh?
"Haley Dunphy Moving Company."

09:57.473 --> 10:00.272
See? 'Cause we're moving you
here and here.

10:00.353 --> 10:03.346
And also... here.

10:03.433 --> 10:06.471
Man, you used to love it
when we swung you like that.

10:06.553 --> 10:08.147
I bet we could still do it.

10:08.234 --> 10:09.224
Yeah!
Yeah.

10:09.313 --> 10:10.793
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:10.913 --> 10:13.144
- Don't you dare pick me up! And take that shirt off.
- What? Why?

10:13.234 --> 10:15.465
- It's cute!
- It's not cute!

10:15.553 --> 10:17.226
Do you see what's
happening out there?

10:17.313 --> 10:20.227
- People are walking around and judging each other.
- No, they're not.

10:20.314 --> 10:23.308
Oh, really? You didn't see the way Muffin
Top across the hall was looking at me?

10:23.395 --> 10:25.626
People can be cruel.
So take it off.

10:25.714 --> 10:27.910
Fine.

10:29.035 --> 10:30.515
Oh, my God!
Put on a shirt!

10:30.594 --> 10:32.790
I don't know
what you want from me!

10:32.875 --> 10:35.151
"You only get one chance
at a first impression.

10:35.236 --> 10:39.150
I suggest Julia Child,
because it's easy to do."

10:39.276 --> 10:41.835
Save the giblets.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.837
Time to go to the beach!

10:44.915 --> 10:46.872
You're gonna go
to the beach with the dog?

10:47.036 --> 10:50.268
That dog on the beach. I don't
know what I did to deserve this.

10:50.357 --> 10:52.155
I want to show Connor my toys.

10:52.237 --> 10:53.637
Oh, okay.
You do that, sweetie.

10:53.716 --> 10:56.835
- Hey, Connor, uh, no hair pulling.
- Thank you for that.

10:56.916 --> 11:00.546
Okay, we have an assortment
of spring rolls here.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.276
All vegetarian, of course.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.110
Oh, 'cause I'm a lesbian, I'm
automatically a vegetarian?

11:05.197 --> 11:07.712
Well, I saw it on The L Word.
I assume they have consultants.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.599
I'm just saying, it's an
offensive stereotype.

11:09.677 --> 11:11.954
Okay, Pam,
you are a vegetarian.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.950
- Oh!
- Knock it off.

11:14.038 --> 11:15.950
Worked out.

11:16.038 --> 11:18.347
Yeah. So glad
that we are doing this.

11:18.437 --> 11:20.269
Yeah. Yeah, me too.
Yeah.

11:20.358 --> 11:22.111
I mean, we're the only
gay parents in the class.

11:22.239 --> 11:24.309
Yeah, we should be
supporting one another.

11:24.399 --> 11:27.789
- I mean, we have so much in common.
- Exactly.

11:30.838 --> 11:33.673
So... tell us
about yourselves.

11:33.798 --> 11:36.598
I'm an environmental lawyer.
Uh, and I'm a homemaker.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.000
Hmm.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.634
And-
And what do you do?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.399
I'm a financial consultant.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.836
- I'm a contractor.
- Hmm.

11:45.959 --> 11:47.713
You thought
I was a P.E. teacher?

11:47.799 --> 11:49.712
I figured. Hey, I have a question.
Real quick:

11:49.799 --> 11:51.597
How do you guys get the car
seat on the motorcycle?

11:51.679 --> 11:54.276
Uh, you know, Connor is
having a birthday next week.

11:54.361 --> 11:56.512
- Maybe Lily would like to come.
- Oh, she would love that.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.239
Oh, great. Are you guys
having a clown?

11:58.361 --> 12:01.593
Oh, God, no. I hate clowns.
They're so creepy.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.515
Maybe you just don't like 'em 'cause
they wear makeup.

12:05.761 --> 12:07.479
You know what? I'm out.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.833
Okay.
Connor, we're leaving!

12:09.921 --> 12:12.118
You don't understand.
Cam used to be a clown.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.841
"Used to be"? Once a
clown, always a clown.

12:13.882 --> 12:15.521
God! Not now! Not now!
Stop it!

12:15.642 --> 12:17.633
Connor, let's go!
Pam.

12:20.482 --> 12:22.518
What?
Why is this door locked?

12:22.601 --> 12:24.720
Here. Let me, please.

12:24.802 --> 12:27.523
Lily, open this door right now.

12:27.643 --> 12:29.600
Okay. I'm not
hearing anything.

12:29.722 --> 12:33.080
I'm sure they're fine.
Oh, how are you sure?

12:33.163 --> 12:34.517
Connor!
Lily!

12:34.643 --> 12:36.441
Connor! Lily!

12:39.603 --> 12:41.994
Make the water
comfortably warm-

12:42.083 --> 12:44.598
90 to 100 degrees max.

12:44.683 --> 12:47.244
And never leave the tub
unsupervised.

12:50.164 --> 12:52.439
Is there something you two want
to share with the class?

12:52.524 --> 12:54.800
No. It's dirty.

12:54.885 --> 12:57.353
Excuse me.
We're trying to learn here.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.155
Don't worry so much. Babies
are tougher than you think.

13:01.245 --> 13:04.158
When I was five years old,
my babysitter was a goat.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.799
What? Ay, please. You
know about Lupe.

13:06.885 --> 13:08.477
Never said she was a goat.

13:08.564 --> 13:12.320
You know, it's great that we have a couple
of experienced parents in the class.

13:12.406 --> 13:16.002
Perhaps you can share some of
your wisdom with the rest of us.

13:16.085 --> 13:17.964
Absolutely.
It's not rocket science.

13:18.046 --> 13:19.844
It's babies.
They're hungry, you feed 'em.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.156
- They're teething, you give 'em some scotch.
- Scotch?

13:22.325 --> 13:23.486
Really?

13:23.565 --> 13:24.761
What?

13:24.886 --> 13:27.925
So we left. I didn't need a
lecture from Mary Poppins.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.760
And I was suddenly
in a mood for a burrito.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.316
I called you,
like, five times already.

13:38.127 --> 13:40.686
I'd like admission to your student body.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.488
Oh, my goodness! I am so sorry.
I thought you were my wife.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.878
- What's going on?
- He grabbed me and said-

13:45.967 --> 13:48.038
I thought she was my wife.
My wife works out a lot.

13:48.168 --> 13:49.807
Dad?
How'd he grab you?

13:49.927 --> 13:52.488
He squeezed my butt.
He what?

13:52.648 --> 13:54.446
Phil!
I thought it was you!

13:54.567 --> 13:57.562
Believe me, sir, I'm a respected Realtor.
This is an innocent mistake.

13:57.649 --> 14:00.083
Honey, turn around and show him your butt.
It's-It's uncanny.

14:00.169 --> 14:03.525
Dad! I am very normal. Please
do not judge me based on them.

14:03.649 --> 14:06.117
Are those your My Little Pony sheets?
What? No!

14:06.208 --> 14:07.722
Oh. I ordered them online.

14:07.808 --> 14:09.728
They must've sent the wrong ones.
I'm very sorry.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.880
- That's what was in the box.
- Oh.

14:14.329 --> 14:16.447
Okay.
Uh, for the record,

14:16.530 --> 14:18.601
I am a respected Realtor.

14:18.689 --> 14:21.727
Those are not my condoms.
She bought 'em.

14:21.809 --> 14:24.170
- Oh, my God.
- Apparently, that's what people do these days-

14:24.209 --> 14:26.041
buy condoms for their kids.
Uh-huh.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.247
When I went to college, my parents
bought me a bicycle helmet.

14:28.329 --> 14:30.730
That was their idea of safety.
Certainly didn't need condoms.

14:30.771 --> 14:33.763
Not if you were wearing a bike
helmet around campus, you didn't.

14:33.850 --> 14:35.921
- Am I right?
- Ugh!

14:36.011 --> 14:38.969
Why don't we let you guys finish,
and we'll come back later?

14:39.051 --> 14:40.565
Okay.
Okay.

14:40.651 --> 14:42.243
Yeah. Yep.
Yeah.

14:42.330 --> 14:45.244
Yeah, that sounds good.
See you on parents' weekend!

14:47.091 --> 14:49.084
They seem nice.
Guys-

14:49.172 --> 14:51.731
I know. I know. Look, we
need to reorganize a little.

14:51.811 --> 14:53.849
Your dad will go out
and get us some new sheets.

14:53.931 --> 14:56.321
You and I can hang up
all the pictures on the walls.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.532
You know what? I think it's
best if you guys get going.

14:58.571 --> 15:02.009
But we-we wanted to help you, sweetie.
No, I got it.

15:02.092 --> 15:03.765
Wh-What if you wanna move
the furniture around?

15:03.893 --> 15:06.043
And we were gonna take you
to dinner before we left.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.250
I like the furniture where it
is, and I'm not hungry, so-

15:09.332 --> 15:10.732
Okay.
Okay.

15:10.812 --> 15:12.963
Um, well, before we leave,

15:13.092 --> 15:14.765
I wanted to give you a
little present. Oh.

15:14.852 --> 15:16.288
It's actually not
a little present.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.842
It's probably the best present
you're ever gonna get.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.367
It's a collection of all
the things I've learned-

15:20.534 --> 15:23.002
Thanks.
Uh-

15:23.093 --> 15:25.928
Attention.
Dorm meeting in the common room.

15:26.054 --> 15:28.808
- Okay, so-I better go.
- I know.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.448
Okay.

15:30.534 --> 15:32.287
Okay, come here.
That's my girl.

15:32.415 --> 15:34.974
Let me get in there.
Okay.

15:35.055 --> 15:36.569
All right.
Bye!

15:36.655 --> 15:38.566
Bye.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.651
"The most amazing things that
can happen to a human being...

15:43.734 --> 15:45.373
will happen to you...

15:45.454 --> 15:47.891
if you just lower
your expectations."

15:49.735 --> 15:51.692
Oh, they've got something
over the hole.

15:51.855 --> 15:53.687
Lily!
Connor!

15:53.776 --> 15:56.974
We can't see anything from outside.
The curtains are closed.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.729
Open up, Connor! We'll
let you have a hot dog!

15:59.815 --> 16:01.455
What if something
happened to them?

16:01.575 --> 16:03.216
What kind of hazards
do you keep in there?

16:03.257 --> 16:05.457
Well, let's see. That's where
we keep our gun collection,

16:05.497 --> 16:07.614
our abandoned refrigerator and our
chocolate-covered hypodermic needles.

16:07.736 --> 16:10.377
Why are gay men always so sarcastic?
It's my coping mechanism!

16:10.456 --> 16:11.936
Okay, that's it!

16:12.017 --> 16:15.134
Lily, Connor, if you can hear
me, back away from the door.

16:15.297 --> 16:17.015
I'm gonna break it down.
I'll help you.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.811
I don't want Connor to go!

16:18.937 --> 16:21.692
I wanna stay! Oh, thank God.
They're alive.

16:21.778 --> 16:23.258
I love him!

16:23.337 --> 16:26.490
No, you love the idea of him.
Now open this door, sweetie.

16:26.577 --> 16:28.694
Can we really have hot dogs?

16:28.778 --> 16:30.735
Yes, we promise.

16:32.097 --> 16:33.939
Oh!
Come here, sweetheart.

16:33.978 --> 16:38.053
If you ask me, sometimes we
get so hung up on our differences,

16:38.139 --> 16:40.175
we forget the one thing
we have in common.

16:40.259 --> 16:43.058
When it comes to the safety and
well-being of our children,

16:43.139 --> 16:45.131
we're all a little bit nuts.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.895
You have dainty little hands,
just like your daughter.

16:48.978 --> 16:50.493
You have boots like my dad.

16:52.339 --> 16:54.650
I'm not saying that the
goat put me to sleep...

16:54.739 --> 16:56.412
or brushed my teeth.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.536
It just stayed outside
my bedroom window...

16:58.619 --> 17:00.372
and scared
all the strangers away.

17:00.459 --> 17:03.531
Well, I'm not gonna lie. I'm a
little disappointed. Hey, kid!

17:03.619 --> 17:05.771
Jay, Mom. How was class?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.534
It was great.
It was very educating.

17:08.619 --> 17:11.011
And-And now we know everything
about the baby, no?

17:11.099 --> 17:14.218
Mm-hmm. Interesting,
because your teacher called,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.734
and you forgot your
sunglasses when you left-

17:16.819 --> 17:18.778
three hours early.

17:18.859 --> 17:20.500
Ay, Manny, don't be mad.

17:20.619 --> 17:23.455
I'm not mad.
Just disappointed.

17:23.580 --> 17:26.097
I hate this.
I prefer when he screams.

17:26.181 --> 17:29.937
Manny, it's no big deal. They weren't
telling us anything we didn't already know.

17:30.022 --> 17:32.742
We're going to have a baby. Am I
the only one who's terrified?

17:32.821 --> 17:36.783
But why?
Why are you so terrified?

17:36.862 --> 17:40.174
What if it doesn't know not to pick up knives
or stick its finger in an electric socket?

17:40.263 --> 17:42.175
You were pretty lax, Mom.

17:42.263 --> 17:45.573
I was the one who told you to turn the pot handles
towards the stove so I couldn't reach them.

17:45.662 --> 17:49.703
Manny, I didn't worry about those things
because you worried for the both of us.

17:49.783 --> 17:52.697
What if this baby doesn't think
things through? It's part Jay.

17:52.784 --> 17:55.218
No offense taken.

17:55.304 --> 17:57.863
If the baby's different,
we'll be different.

17:57.944 --> 18:02.973
Hey. When you were growing up, you had
to be the man of the house and the kid.

18:03.064 --> 18:05.579
Now I'm here.
You just have to be the kid.

18:05.663 --> 18:07.815
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to the baby,

18:07.904 --> 18:11.136
just like I'm not ever gonna
let anything happen to you.

18:11.225 --> 18:13.295
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:13.424 --> 18:15.417
That is a load off.

18:15.505 --> 18:18.737
Although, you forgot to pick me
up last week after tango class.

18:18.824 --> 18:21.294
We didn't forget.
We were just 10 minutes late.

18:21.384 --> 18:23.263
Ten minutes is a long time
in a sketchy neighborhood.

18:23.344 --> 18:26.100
Please. It was between a
Gymboree and a Pottery Barn.

18:26.185 --> 18:28.746
"Dance until your feet hurt.

18:28.825 --> 18:31.546
Sing until your lungs hurt.

18:31.625 --> 18:35.063
Act until
you're William Hurt."

18:38.226 --> 18:40.139
How you doing?
Are you okay?

18:40.227 --> 18:43.981
Yeah. No, I'm-
I'm-I'm-I'm good. You?

18:44.067 --> 18:45.786
Fine. Yeah.

18:45.866 --> 18:47.346
Great.

18:58.948 --> 19:01.065
"Take a lesson from parakeets.

19:01.147 --> 19:04.618
If you're ever feeling lonely,
just eat in front of a mirror.

19:06.587 --> 19:09.022
Never be afraid
to reach for the stars,

19:09.107 --> 19:10.828
because even if you fall,

19:10.908 --> 19:15.586
you'll always be wearing
a parent-chute. T. M."

19:18.628 --> 19:20.859
Haley! Hi, honey.
You okay?

19:21.789 --> 19:23.382
Yeah.

19:23.469 --> 19:25.904
- Where are you guys?
- Almost home, honey.

19:25.989 --> 19:29.300
Dad, I really like that book.
You do?

19:29.389 --> 19:31.666
Sweetheart, is everything okay?

19:31.750 --> 19:35.027
Yeah. I just wanted to say
thank you for everhing-

19:35.109 --> 19:37.704
you know, today and stuff.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.103
Of course. Of course. Sure.

19:42.190 --> 19:44.341
If-If you need anything
at all, you just call us.

19:44.471 --> 19:47.782
- I'll probably need some more condoms soon.
- Not funny.

19:47.870 --> 19:49.942
I'm sending you
some Care Bear sheets.

19:50.071 --> 19:52.426
Anyway, I should
probably get going.

19:52.511 --> 19:54.149
We have orientation
at 7:00 a.m.

19:54.231 --> 19:57.302
G-Good luck with that,
sweetie.

19:58.191 --> 20:00.309
I love you guys.

20:00.391 --> 20:02.543
We love you too, honey.

20:02.631 --> 20:04.385
So, so much.

20:04.472 --> 20:06.668
Bye.
Bye, Haley.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.470
I'll miss you.

20:20.152 --> 20:24.351
"Marry someone who looks
sexy while disappointed."

20:25.872 --> 20:27.387
See?

20:27.473 --> 20:30.864
"Older black ladies make
the best iced tea."

20:32.714 --> 20:35.149
"Success is
one percent inspiration,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.987
98% perspiration...

20:38.074 --> 20:40.714
and two percent
attention to detail."

20:40.833 --> 20:42.985
"You can tell a lot
about a person...

20:43.074 --> 20:45.066
from his biography."

20:46.594 --> 20:49.110
"Watch a sunrise
at least once a day."

20:50.674 --> 20:52.871
"If you love something,
set it free-

20:52.955 --> 20:55.594
unless it's a tiger."

20:55.674 --> 20:57.267
"If you're ever in a jam,

20:57.354 --> 21:01.634
a crayon scrunched up under your
nose makes a good pretend mustache."

21:01.716 --> 21:04.992
"When life gives you lemonade,
make lemons.

21:05.076 --> 21:08.035
Life will be all,
like, 'What?'"
