26:37.117 --> 26:38.988
and we'’re setting Bank
of America on fire.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.469
Good night Daphne.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.036
I'’ll see ya.

26:43.079 --> 26:46.082
-Uh, thanks.
-Uh huh, bye.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.870
So you really liked that.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.657
Watching me doing
it with Daphne.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.225
Yes, it turned me on...

26:58.268 --> 27:02.098
seeing someone else
enjoy your body.

27:02.142 --> 27:05.145
I gotta say I felt
weird at first,

27:05.188 --> 27:07.669
but I kinda got into
watching you watch me.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.411
I loved seeing you come.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.066
Really?

27:13.109 --> 27:15.808
I feel like I must
look so stupid.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.505
No.

27:17.548 --> 27:20.290
Some people possess
structural beauty.

27:20.334 --> 27:23.729
Some emotional beauty,
but you have both.

27:23.772 --> 27:28.559
Your face is like
a masterfully crafted cello

27:28.603 --> 27:31.519
playing an exquisite symphony.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.869
Wow, Sev.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.264
Your words are like poems.
