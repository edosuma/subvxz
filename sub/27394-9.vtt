00:06.528 --> 00:08.878
- Previously,
on "Deadly Class"...

00:08.921 --> 00:11.098
- I didn't think it was gonna
feel this way.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.664
- When you were trying
to kiss me?

00:12.708 --> 00:15.537
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt a quality moment

00:15.580 --> 00:16.799
with you and my boyfriend.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.237
- Kill her!

00:20.281 --> 00:21.543
- You can't hide
from Fiery Jack

00:21.586 --> 00:23.371
and Captain Sensible, Maria!

00:25.242 --> 00:26.765
- Get this crazy bitch off me!

00:26.809 --> 00:28.854
- My son is dead.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.813
You can't understand my pain.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.162
But you will.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.729
- I, too, lost a child.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.253
- If Nahia had lived,
would you have sent her to us?

00:36.297 --> 00:37.341
- I would have been proud

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
to see her follow
in your footsteps.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.475
- Hello, brother.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.824
You thought you could
hide them?

00:41.867 --> 00:43.304
She'll never be out of danger.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.610
- Marcus, he's the key.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.744
- And why bring this to me
and not Master Lin?

00:48.787 --> 00:51.268
- My pa always told me
to bet on the winning horse.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.835
- Time to suck boot.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.663
I will suck
the most prosperous one.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.448
- Let's put that to the test.

01:01.235 --> 01:04.673
- All right, and one, two,
one, two, three, four.

- Yeah.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.484
You have a real gift, sir.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.704
- God smiled on me.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.843
You reek, Mr. Shabnam!

03:11.887 --> 03:15.717
Guess it's time
for some fresh newspaper.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.675
Come on, come on.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
There we go.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.854
Thinking about
switching you to diapers

03:22.898 --> 03:25.030
or maybe just...

03:25.074 --> 03:27.816
tie a coffee can
to your hind side.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.297
- It's a jailbreak!

03:33.387 --> 03:36.651
- He's getting away!

03:47.444 --> 03:49.577
- It's over, Johnny.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.405
- Nothing is over.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.667
Nothing!

03:52.710 --> 03:54.799
- This is our First Blood,
Gran Gran!

03:54.843 --> 03:58.586
- My own, special
John Rambo.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.507
Oh, it worked so good!

04:15.472 --> 04:17.996
- You must not love.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.695
You must not marry.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.524
You must discard friends
and ideals.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.439
Violation of these edicts

04:25.482 --> 04:29.356
is the most common downfall
of our kind.

04:29.399 --> 04:32.054
To achieve true commitment
to the life,

04:32.097 --> 04:34.926
we must drown
these frail needs.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.757
- Emotions are
a chemical mirage

04:39.801 --> 04:41.759
that will betray you.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.849
Leave you exposed.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.117
To care for another human

04:52.161 --> 04:56.034
is to create your own
greatest weakness.

04:56.078 --> 05:00.430
If you love someone enough
to die for them...

05:00.474 --> 05:03.651
then you surely will.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.579
- Some speech.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.755
Really got me thinking.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.147
If you're not fighting
for an ideal,

05:22.191 --> 05:24.976
then you're just fighting
for yourself.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.500
If that's what you think,
then that means

05:26.543 --> 05:28.023
everything you said
when I came here

05:28.066 --> 05:30.634
was all garbage, wasn't it?

05:30.678 --> 05:33.681
That pre-rehearsed sermon?

05:33.724 --> 05:35.160
"Give the peasants the power

05:35.204 --> 05:36.597
"to overthrow
their corrupt masters.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.034
"Give my--my rage
a voice loud enough

05:39.077 --> 05:41.515
to be heard around the world."

05:43.430 --> 05:44.953
Jurgen was right.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.737
Carrot on a stick.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.174
You pretend that you empower

05:49.218 --> 05:51.176
the poor outcasts like me,

05:51.220 --> 05:54.484
but you don't care about that.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
- The boy who had nothing

05:56.051 --> 05:58.009
is offered the key
to change the world.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.621
Instead of trying, he killed
the man who gave it to him.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.884
- Or another old man exploits
the frustrations

06:02.927 --> 06:05.452
of the next generation
to his own ends.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.848
- The young always
tell themselves

06:10.892 --> 06:14.591
that when they get their chance
they'll do things differently.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.071
Burn it all down.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.117
And yet, all these
millennia later,

06:19.161 --> 06:21.642
the world remains the same.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.731
Humans remain the same.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.429
You either accept it,
navigate it,

06:26.473 --> 06:29.606
or allow yourself
to be suffocated by it.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.742
- From where I'm standing,

06:34.785 --> 06:37.484
you're the one
who's suffocating.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.703
I confessed.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.489
I broke all your rules
and I'm still alive.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.492
You know what I think?

06:45.535 --> 06:48.103
I think once upon a time,

06:48.146 --> 06:50.932
you were on the other side
of this conversation.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.589
I think you let me live

06:55.632 --> 06:58.853
because I'm who you used to be.

06:58.896 --> 07:01.682
I'm who you suffocated.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.127
- Is the boy leaving?

07:15.173 --> 07:18.263
- No.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.615
Everything I'm willing
to die for is right here.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.633
Jesus.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.286
Is that Shabnam's dad?

07:41.330 --> 07:43.811
- His mom could be in there
as well.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.290
- All the more reason
we have to do this now.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.163
- Shabnam's house
is rigged with traps.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.818
Chester has seven to eight
people inside helping him.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.907
- You're sure he has
Chico?

07:52.950 --> 07:55.736
- It's no bluff,
he knows everything.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.824
He has to be
getting information

07:56.867 --> 07:58.042
from someone inside of King's.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.609
- Shabnam's parents.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.655
- There's another problem.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.091
El Diablo.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.833
If this animal
sends him Chico's head,

08:05.876 --> 08:07.269
if he finds out it was me--

08:07.312 --> 08:10.185
- We're gonna need
some serious firepower.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.361
Guns, explosives.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.320
- Y'all must be
out your damn minds.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.290
- Hey!

08:30.161 --> 08:31.946
You know, I didn't mean
to bring this into our lives,

08:31.989 --> 08:33.077
but it's here, and we have--

08:33.121 --> 08:35.123
- We ain't no damn SWAT team!

08:35.166 --> 08:37.038
- No, we're better trained.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.693
It's not just our asses, okay?

08:39.736 --> 08:40.998
Killing Chester?

08:41.042 --> 08:43.131
We'll be saving people, man.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.350
- "There are many causes
I'd die for,

08:45.394 --> 08:47.265
There ain't a single cause
I'd kill for."

08:47.309 --> 08:48.702
- Oh, pacifism.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.007
It's a nice idea,

08:50.051 --> 08:52.227
but if you don't help
once I fight,

08:52.270 --> 08:53.794
then you help
the other side win.

08:53.837 --> 08:57.058
- This hero shit.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.930
It's just a mask you wear
to justify the chaos.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.367
You wanna know what I think?

09:02.411 --> 09:05.893
I think maybe you looking
to get yourself killed.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.810
- Yeah, well,
maybe pretending to be a hero

09:09.853 --> 09:13.640
is better than accepting
that you're not one.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.729
- Gabby's right.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.035
So used to living
in toxic air,

09:18.079 --> 09:21.822
I can't even
see straight anymore.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.040
- What about your friends?

09:23.084 --> 09:24.694
- Shit.

09:24.738 --> 09:28.655
Marcus, if this is what being
your friend gets me...

09:49.937 --> 09:52.374
- Willie's out?

09:55.507 --> 09:58.989
- Okay, the backyard and all
the doors are booby-trapped,

09:59.033 --> 10:02.340
the windows are reinforced,
but if we get some C-4--

10:02.384 --> 10:04.299
- Yeah, yeah, they sell that
at Costco, right?

10:04.342 --> 10:06.301
Next to the big bags
of popcorn.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.216
- There's only one person
I know who can get it.

10:08.259 --> 10:11.001
- Great, let's go.
- No, I said he canget it.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.481
Whether he will
is the real question.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.005
Especially after what
you did to him.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.791
- It's a pass.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.141
- A hard pass.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.708
- If we don't stop Chester

10:21.751 --> 10:23.187
and get Chico's head,
the cartel--

10:23.231 --> 10:24.711
- The cartel will kill her

10:24.754 --> 10:26.321
and the serial killer
will kill you.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.975
Everyone will die.
We get it.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.324
- So why won't you help?

10:29.367 --> 10:31.805
- Help the loony bird
who almost castrated me?

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
- The hillbillies?
The cartel?

10:33.807 --> 10:36.026
- It's bloody Christmas break.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.463
I've got a plane ticket
and a pint with my name on it.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.770
- We need you.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.207
Please.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.083
- This is the guy
who cut up Marcus?

10:49.126 --> 10:50.432
- No.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.347
Stop letting this madness
into your head, Petra.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
Go ruin someone else's holiday.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.263
Shoo.
- All right.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.264
Come on, Saya, let's go.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.918
You were right.
He's all bark.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.180
I thought he wanted to change
the world with a bullet.

10:59.223 --> 11:00.485
- More a figure
of speech, mate.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.792
- Oh.
- Right, so it's all talk.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.229
- You talk a lot about
the good that you want to do

11:05.273 --> 11:07.449
with what you've been
taught here--someday.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.451
- There is no one
who deserves a bullet more

11:09.494 --> 11:11.714
than that monster
we're about to face.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.021
If you are as good
as you say you are,

11:14.064 --> 11:15.892
put your money where
your loud ------- mouth is.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.199
Help us.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.037
- I know a bloke.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.133
- Gao knows.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.527
- How did she find out?

11:42.571 --> 11:45.095
- I don't know.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.231
- What do you think
she will do?

11:50.274 --> 11:54.104
- Father always said
she had shark's teeth.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.933
- Would she--
- Mommy?

11:56.977 --> 12:00.067
What's wrong?

12:00.110 --> 12:02.069
- Everything is fine.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.072
Come here, I need your help
with something.

12:11.992 --> 12:15.604
- And you think she's ready?

12:15.647 --> 12:18.476
- She has been ready
for centuries.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.392
Our bloodline belongs
to the Guild.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.833
You are my firstborn son.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.444
Your destiny is here.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.968
Hers is not.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
- I understand, it's just--

12:33.840 --> 12:36.930
- If you understand,
then you understand.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.454
There is nothing more to say.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.510
- I think that China will be
a great adventure for you.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.476
- It is my honor
to have been chosen.

13:06.394 --> 13:10.093
- It belonged
to your grandfather.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.399
- Thank you.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.836
I will take
very good care of it,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.492
and I promise
I will not disappoint you.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.332
- Gao lost her only son

13:31.375 --> 13:33.551
to the temple...

13:33.595 --> 13:35.031
so don't think for a second

13:35.075 --> 13:37.512
she'll allow Nahia
to walk away.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.689
She won't be satisfied
until you've been punished

13:40.732 --> 13:43.648
for not defending her.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.433
Has she reported us
to the Guild?

13:45.476 --> 13:48.915
- No, it would bring shame
to her entire family.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.918
Mostly on her.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.006
- So Gao is the only one

13:53.049 --> 13:55.660
who knows that Nahia
and I are alive?

14:11.633 --> 14:14.331
- Shu.

14:14.375 --> 14:18.118
I'll do what must be done
to protect our family.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.918
- Oh, hey.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.617
- Headed home for Christmas?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.489
Oh, right.

14:41.532 --> 14:45.406
Homeless, no family,
tragic backstory.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.756
We don't really
celebrate Christmas either,

14:47.799 --> 14:50.933
but we're really into
Chinese takeout.

14:55.546 --> 14:58.549
- Hey, Shab, do you...

14:58.593 --> 14:59.855
- Do I what?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.857
- Just, you--you've been
talking to your parents

15:01.901 --> 15:03.728
a lot recently.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.513
- Yeah, yeah.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.645
Normally they're
so preoccupied

15:07.689 --> 15:09.473
with whatever coup
they're funding

15:09.517 --> 15:11.736
that they don't care
that I got an "A" in Forgery--

15:11.780 --> 15:13.695
- It's just, um...

15:13.738 --> 15:16.654
you haven't told them
anything about me, right?

15:16.698 --> 15:18.134
- Pardon?

15:18.178 --> 15:20.658
- Get out.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.008
- Oh, so you're not even trying

15:22.051 --> 15:25.054
to keep this thing
a secret anymore.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.374
- So what did Lex say?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.854
- He'll help.
Petra, too.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.907
- I keep waiting
for you to apologize.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.996
Some sort of acknowledgement

15:54.040 --> 15:57.826
of this huge secret you kept.

15:57.869 --> 16:01.438
- I'm sorry, I just--
I thought...

16:01.482 --> 16:02.962
I--I wasn't sure
you could handle it.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.267
- And Saya could?

16:04.311 --> 16:07.749
- She knew about
the Boys' Home already, so I...

16:07.792 --> 16:10.665
Shit.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.625
- I don't care.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.540
I trust you.

16:16.584 --> 16:20.718
I can't add worrying about this
to the list.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.460
I just...

16:27.073 --> 16:29.640
I don't want
to be alone tonight.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.862
Stay with me?

16:33.905 --> 16:36.734
It could be our last time.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.954
- Of course.

16:56.145 --> 16:59.627
- Alcoholics call it
"doing a geographic."

17:01.542 --> 17:03.109
Doesn't matter how far you go.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.590
Your problems will follow you.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.767
- My moms used to call me
"Peter Pan."

17:09.811 --> 17:12.074
Said I'd never grow up.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.077
She sent me here
to change all that.

17:16.296 --> 17:20.691
But if this
is what growing up means,

17:20.735 --> 17:22.258
you can count me out.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.956
- But leaving now
when we're in so much trouble?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.569
After what Marcus did for you?

17:43.236 --> 17:46.978
- Okay, yeah.

17:47.022 --> 17:50.156
When he first hit that dude...

17:50.199 --> 17:53.159
he saved my ass.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.902
But that second hit...

18:02.646 --> 18:05.867
He didn't kill that dude
for me.

18:08.609 --> 18:12.134
It's this place.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.050
This place is changing him.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.881
It's changing all of y'all.

18:28.324 --> 18:31.022
- We love you, Willie.

18:31.066 --> 18:34.156
This is your home.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.202
But if you leave now,

18:36.245 --> 18:38.682
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.684
- Maybe.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.689
But if I know one thing
about Peter Pan...

18:47.648 --> 18:50.172
He can't become a pirate.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.139
- Meeting Lex's contact

19:00.182 --> 19:01.879
at The Adolescents show
tonight.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.882
Bring whatever money
you've got.

19:04.926 --> 19:08.843
- I, uh--look, have Lex
store the explosives

19:08.886 --> 19:10.105
in the back of the comic shop.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.151
I'll open the store tomorrow.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.065
No one else be there.
- You're not coming?

19:14.109 --> 19:15.284
You're just leaving me
to deal with it?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.895
- I--I promised Maria.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.158
She's upset.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.594
- Well, you know what,
do whatever you gotta do

19:20.637 --> 19:21.595
to straighten her out, Romeo.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.074
We need her
in full form tomorrow.

19:23.118 --> 19:26.121
- Hey, listen, I never
thanked you for all the help.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
- Don't flatter yourself.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.734
No choice.
You're my pledge.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.390
But if you get everyone
killed tomorrow

19:34.434 --> 19:35.435
and you screw it up,

19:35.478 --> 19:37.785
I'm the one
stuck paying the price.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.073
- Probably not all
mall Santas are pedophiles,

20:05.116 --> 20:07.467
but, I mean, the percentages
have gotta be high, right?

20:07.510 --> 20:09.295
- Well, now I'm thinking on it,
Christmas is that

20:09.338 --> 20:10.774
one night a year where
a strange bearded man

20:10.818 --> 20:12.167
is allowed
to sneak into the house.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.299
- ♪ Dashing through the snow

20:13.342 --> 20:16.215
♪ In a one-horse
open sleigh ♪

20:16.258 --> 20:18.826
♪ Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way, ha-- ♪

20:20.436 --> 20:23.352
- God, you are kidding me.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.402
His master, the piety king
of lecture town sent you solo?

20:29.445 --> 20:32.753
- He's dealing with
another mess.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.363
Why'd you pick the show?

20:34.407 --> 20:35.625
- I already had tickets

20:35.669 --> 20:37.627
and I was not gonna miss
The Adolescents.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.282
- Let's get this over with.
- Hey, wait up!

20:40.326 --> 20:43.154
Have an extra ticket?

20:45.766 --> 20:48.247
- What made you
change your mind?

20:48.290 --> 20:49.335
- Just didn't feel right

20:49.378 --> 20:51.815
leaving it all
on your shoulders.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.426
- Ugh.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.862
West coast punk.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.864
The yanks stole punk from us
and ruined it.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.432
- You're high.
Punk started here.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.347
The Stooges, the MC5--

21:01.390 --> 21:02.696
- Home-scene pride is some

21:02.739 --> 21:04.872
thinly-laundered
self-congratulation.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.527
- Right, there's plenty
of great shit from both camps.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.224
- Who are we looking for?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.140
- Oh, you'll know him
when you see him.

21:15.186 --> 21:18.451
- All the colors
of the punk costume rainbow.

21:21.454 --> 21:24.283
- Oi, Cactus Jack.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.720
Bit overdressed, aren't we?
- You foreign grommet.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.591
You couldn't meet
in a seedy parking lot

21:28.635 --> 21:29.897
or a crack squat?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.377
Had to be at this freak show?

21:31.420 --> 21:33.727
- You two must know each other
really well.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.120
- Oh, meet Cactus Jack.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.861
Uh, hard to tell
by looking at him,

21:37.905 --> 21:39.820
but Jack runs
an Army Navy surplus store

21:39.863 --> 21:42.431
and really likes
blowing things up.

21:42.475 --> 21:45.260
- But I don't deal
with people I don't know.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.741
Strange people.

21:49.873 --> 21:53.268
- So, Jack's a little uptight.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.617
Hard to believe.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.402
Best give me the cash
and I'll get the stuff.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.404
- Mm-mm.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.622
What am I gonna do?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.755
- Buy a bunch of drugs
and booze.

22:01.798 --> 22:04.410
- Yeah, your suspicion
is rightfully warranted.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.846
Take it or leave it.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.848
- Fine.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.416
After you get everything,
stash it in the comic shop.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.853
Back loading area.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.814
The rest of us,
meet there tomorrow.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.164
8:00 p.m.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.821
- Let's get closer.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.780
- You know my position
on that notion.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.782
- I think I'll head back.

22:28.825 --> 22:32.481
Gonna get some rest before
we go commit suicide tomorrow.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.440
- Are you crazy?

22:34.483 --> 22:37.704
The goddamn Adolescents
are playing.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.270
- I--I'm not interested.

22:39.314 --> 22:43.231
- It might be
your last night on Earth.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.581
Let's have some fun.
- We have to prep, I--

22:45.625 --> 22:47.714
- We've done everything
that we can do.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.325
The rest is out of our hands.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.197
- I mean, I just don't want
to get beat up by strangers.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.548
- Slam dancing,
it's not like that.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.724
It's a pure expression
of their enthusiasm

22:57.767 --> 22:58.725
and joy for music.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.422
It looks violent but it's not.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.990
It's play fighting.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.034
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.688
- Quit being
so goddamn judgmental

23:05.732 --> 23:08.865
and you might actually
enjoy yourself.

23:08.909 --> 23:12.695
Contrary to what
you seem to think.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.350
Life is supposed
to be enjoyed.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.361
- ♪ Go!

23:43.552 --> 23:46.294
♪ Kids in a fast lane
living for today ♪

23:46.337 --> 23:48.992
♪ No rules to abide by
and no one to obey ♪

23:52.387 --> 23:54.868
♪ Sex, drugs, and fun is their
only thought and care ♪

23:54.911 --> 23:59.568
♪ Another swig of brew
another overnight affair ♪

24:03.093 --> 24:05.313
♪ House of the filthy,

24:05.356 --> 24:08.011
♪ House of destruction

24:08.055 --> 24:10.579
♪ House that belonged

24:18.848 --> 24:21.503
♪ House of destruction

24:21.547 --> 24:25.072
♪ House that belonged

24:32.340 --> 24:35.038
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.869
- What's going on?

24:43.699 --> 24:45.396
I'm going.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.790
I've gotta get out of here
before I lose my mind.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.706
I got a sister out in LA.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.753
I figure I can sell my car
when I get down there

24:53.796 --> 24:56.669
and it'd give me
enough money to get started.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.498
- So...

24:59.541 --> 25:00.934
when did you decide
all of this?

25:00.977 --> 25:04.024
- Thought about
what you told me.

25:04.067 --> 25:07.462
I can't keep--I can't keep
running with this crew.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.605
Come with me.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.912
- What?
- Come with me.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.567
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.614
And, look, I know
it's crazy quick but...

25:30.616 --> 25:32.356
You're month-to-month.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.533
You hate the fog.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.100
- Yeah.
- It's a fresh start in LA.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.494
That's the whole point.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.498
Hey, hey.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.982
We can be
whoever we want down there.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.511
- Holy shit,
that was ------- amazing!

25:56.555 --> 25:58.469
That was nothing like
how I thought it was!

25:58.513 --> 26:00.907
- You had contempt
prior to investigation.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.649
- Oh, man, I got knocked down
and the scariest guy in there,

26:03.692 --> 26:05.694
he picked me up,
patted me on the back,

26:05.738 --> 26:07.522
and he--he wrapped
his arm around me

26:07.566 --> 26:08.871
and we started
dancing around together.

26:08.915 --> 26:12.092
- Like I told you,
camaraderie.

26:12.135 --> 26:15.138
We got lucky there were
no metalheads there.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.663
They misunderstand
the whole situation.

26:17.706 --> 26:20.622
Show up, throw punches,
start fights.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.103
Same as the skinheads.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.671
They start beating
on the mohawks.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.499
I'm glad you went in.

26:28.543 --> 26:29.849
I'm glad you got
to experience it.

26:29.892 --> 26:32.591
I had an amazing time.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.203
Let me have one of those.

26:50.086 --> 26:53.568
- You know, you never tell me
anything about you.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.657
It's a real discrepancy
in our relationship,

26:55.701 --> 26:59.052
considering that you know
everything about me.

27:01.968 --> 27:05.493
Aww, come on,
dark and mysterious.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.713
Give me--

27:07.756 --> 27:09.845
Give me a little something
about yourself.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.152
Anything.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.506
Mm!

27:47.970 --> 27:51.321
- Eyes open
like sandpaper.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.892
Ugh, how much
did we drink last night?

27:56.936 --> 28:01.070
Head feels like
it was ------ by a giant.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.638
Everything hurts.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.033
Her hair smells like snow.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.255
Not Maria's hair.

28:12.299 --> 28:13.996
Not Maria.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.432
No!

28:15.476 --> 28:18.871
What did you do?

28:18.914 --> 28:22.265
Cheated on my girlfriend with
a deadly Japanese assassin.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.313
Something else gnawing.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.575
The comic shop.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.533
We were supposed
to open two hours ago.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.144
If I don't open, Blaine will,

28:31.187 --> 28:32.536
and if Blaine opens
he'll find--

28:32.580 --> 28:34.190
Shit!
- Huh?

28:34.234 --> 28:35.539
Where the hell are you going?

28:35.583 --> 28:37.498
- Uh, late to open comics.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.978
- What?

28:39.021 --> 28:41.502
- The store is full
of explosives!

28:44.287 --> 28:46.333
So drunk.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.118
Still drunk.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.164
What did you do?

28:53.079 --> 28:54.471
Head pounding.

28:54.515 --> 28:58.258
Throw myself under a bus.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.129
Maria weeping in her room.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.088
- You pile of shit.

29:02.131 --> 29:05.134
You're the kind of guy
you hate!

29:05.178 --> 29:06.962
Saya...

29:07.006 --> 29:08.398
I never experience
anything like her.

29:08.442 --> 29:11.010
She--her eyes burned me.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.446
She seemed to really know.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.535
Like she could
fix everything.

29:14.578 --> 29:17.059
Oh shit.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.629
She could take on the chore
of being with me.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.673
She could be good enough.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.458
She could make me whole.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.721
Help me get free.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.941
The feature film
of last night flashes.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.117
Sound catches up,
gut twists.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.640
No.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.773
Jesus Christ, tell me
I didn't say it.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.083
You idiot!

29:41.127 --> 29:43.651
You weak, needy,
worthless piece of shit!

29:43.694 --> 29:45.696
How lame did I sound?

29:45.740 --> 29:48.308
Don't worry about
how you sounded.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.006
Worry if you meant
what you said.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.573
Maria once told me,

29:52.616 --> 29:55.184
"The difference between
old friends and new friends

29:55.228 --> 29:57.752
is that new friends just
haven't let you down yet."

29:57.796 --> 30:00.363
She told me that everyone
has let her down--

30:00.407 --> 30:02.148
except for me.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.280
And all I could think was,

30:04.324 --> 30:06.239
"Give me time."

30:06.282 --> 30:08.197
- What the ----, man?
- We've been here for hours!

30:08.241 --> 30:09.633
- All right, I'm sorry.
- You look like shit!

30:09.677 --> 30:12.201
- I know, I know.
- Let us in!

30:12.245 --> 30:14.638
- Poser dick can't even
open the shop!

30:17.076 --> 30:18.555
- Okay!

30:18.599 --> 30:20.470
Relax!

30:20.514 --> 30:22.733
- ---- you!
- Dude, just let us in already.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.648
- About time, asshole.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.652
- You owe me Spider-Man
fighting Sabretooth!

30:28.696 --> 30:31.525
You promised!

30:33.353 --> 30:36.312
- Lost Innocence Comics,
this is Marcus.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.271
Oh--oh, hey, Blaine.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.099
---- off, Mike.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.448
Oh, yeah, no, everything's law.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.842
I was just in the bathroom.

30:43.885 --> 30:46.670
Cool.

30:46.714 --> 30:49.456
Yeah, I'll grade
that new batch.

30:49.499 --> 30:52.067
- I don't care
if you're hung over.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.678
You promised me
if I brought you a sandwich

30:54.722 --> 30:57.507
you'd draw a Sabretooth
fighting Spider-Man!

30:57.551 --> 30:59.248
- Oh, ---- off, Mike.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.381
- Come on!

31:01.424 --> 31:04.384
Can you just sketch it?

31:06.560 --> 31:09.693
- Oh, God,
please ---- off, Mike.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.174
But he doesn't.

31:15.308 --> 31:18.137
- You violated your curfew.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.442
- Sorry, I--I was just--

31:19.486 --> 31:22.402
- Don't embarrass yourself
further by lying.

31:24.926 --> 31:28.234
When your father died
I made a promise to protect you

31:28.277 --> 31:31.541
as if you were
my own daughter.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.543
During your time here
you've become one

31:33.587 --> 31:36.372
of the most fearsome
warriors alive.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.201
Well on your way
to becoming valedictorian.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.376
- Thank you, Master Lin.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.205
- But my training comes
with a price.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.859
Your sword is in my service

31:44.903 --> 31:48.776
until the day
you return to Tokyo.

31:48.819 --> 31:52.345
Can I trust you to honor
your obligations as I have?

31:52.388 --> 31:55.783
- Yes, of course.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.568
- Tonight you will go
to this address.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.354
Guard it with your life.

32:01.397 --> 32:03.747
- Tonight I have--
- That is not a request.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.445
- Yes, sir.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.447
And where will you be?

32:07.490 --> 32:10.363
- I've been called
to the Guild.

32:10.406 --> 32:13.670
- Next to me all day, griping.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.411
Hours creep.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.152
Each one takes longer
than the last.

32:17.196 --> 32:20.112
Hangover gets worse,
every move hurts.

32:20.155 --> 32:23.289
And they yell,
and they bicker over trivia.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.681
- Uh, this is clearly
Very Fine.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.466
Overstreet says it's worth
no more than six dollars.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.642
- They haggle over
pedantic nonsense.

32:28.685 --> 32:32.776
They try and argue with me
about who the best inker is,

32:32.820 --> 32:35.257
how little I really know
about "Doom Patrol,"

32:35.301 --> 32:38.260
how much better Paul Smith is
than John Byrne.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.437
Oh, that goddamn burrito.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.745
Gas pains like
a ball of spikes.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.748
There's no way
I'm gonna hide this fart.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.839
- You promised me
you'd draw it.

32:51.882 --> 32:56.278
- This is going to bellow
like a dying elephant.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.324
Mike's face.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.283
I can literally fart
right into his mouth.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.676
Hey, Mike.
- What?

33:02.719 --> 33:05.722
- Get a load of this.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.202
There was no fart.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.336
- What the--

33:10.379 --> 33:12.555
- A broken Slurpee machine.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.209
- What the hell's
the matter with you?

33:14.253 --> 33:16.168
- A torrent of hot liquid.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.560
Oh...

33:17.604 --> 33:19.867
- Marcus just shit himself
on purpose!

33:19.910 --> 33:22.261
- Aww, gross!
- Run the store, Mike.

33:22.304 --> 33:23.479
Make sure no one
steals anything!

33:23.523 --> 33:25.742
- Or what, you'll shit
at them too?

33:25.786 --> 33:28.223
This is fate.

33:28.267 --> 33:31.966
This is what you get.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.881
Soaked down to my shoes.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.839
Payback.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.320
Cheated on your girlfriend.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.279
Karma.

33:40.322 --> 33:41.802
Gallons of it.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.422
Oh!
- Marcus?

33:53.466 --> 33:55.859
- We catch you
at a bad time, dude?

33:55.903 --> 33:57.209
- Store's closed.
- No!

33:59.863 --> 34:02.692
- Eat my balls!

34:02.736 --> 34:06.218
- Go suck a dick,
you munchkins!

34:06.261 --> 34:09.003
- All right, Foul Frank,
get dressed.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.224
- Where's Saya?

34:12.267 --> 34:13.747
- Well, we figured you knew.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.750
We lost track of you guys
after the show.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.756
- ♪ One step beyond

35:14.721 --> 35:18.333
- You seem surprised.

35:18.377 --> 35:21.293
Or is that disappointment?

35:27.516 --> 35:29.431
You knew they were coming.

35:29.475 --> 35:33.435
But you expected to find
a very different scene.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.176
Brandy, what is it you told me

35:35.220 --> 35:36.482
when you came to me
this morning?

35:36.525 --> 35:39.789
- That Lin sent us to kill you.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.792
Had us get real close
so when the time was right...

35:47.580 --> 35:50.104
- It's over.

35:52.106 --> 35:55.675
You lost.

35:55.718 --> 35:59.809
To your credit, they at least
know when to change teams.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.334
You're my older brother.

36:02.377 --> 36:05.728
Some part of me has always
had respect for you.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.646
But to send students?

36:10.690 --> 36:13.432
I'm disappointed.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.812
- I'm telling you, Flaky Flix
is the best cookie.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.596
They got fudge,

36:47.640 --> 36:50.512
wafer, corn flakes.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.514
- Damn, you're so ill-informed.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.603
Keebler.
Far superior.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.952
- Keebler?
- Keebler.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.606
- The shit that little
white gnomes be making?

36:58.825 --> 37:00.174
Yeah, when you say
it like that--

37:00.218 --> 37:01.393
- Hey.
Hey, mister.

37:01.436 --> 37:02.872
Mister, I forgot my wallet.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.701
Need to borrow
a couple extra bucks.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.272
- Here you go, man.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.579
- Gas is real expensive.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.540
- Here.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.412
- Report it when we get
to the nearest payphone.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.501
- Okay?

37:22.544 --> 37:24.372
- Okay.

37:24.416 --> 37:25.765
- Just leave my family
out of it!

37:25.808 --> 37:28.158
- All right.
- Okay?

37:28.202 --> 37:29.899
- All right.
- Just...

37:29.943 --> 37:32.380
Hey, hey, hey!

37:32.424 --> 37:34.730
Just--just...

38:13.987 --> 38:16.685
- Every great man has been
hobbled by diarrhea.

38:16.729 --> 38:19.209
Genghis Khan, JFK,

38:19.253 --> 38:20.776
Gary Coleman.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.735
Time and diarrhea, man.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.172
They're undefeated.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.783
- I guess Saya's not coming?

38:27.827 --> 38:31.178
- Do you think we can
do this without her?

38:33.746 --> 38:36.357
- I doubt it.
- Oh, thank God.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.317
I thought you weren't coming.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.981
- So, are we ready
to do this?

39:02.514 --> 39:04.385
Perhaps Gao will succumb
to her injuries.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.431
I'm sorry!

39:06.474 --> 39:08.433
I did as you instructed!

39:08.476 --> 39:11.392
- She--she moved!
Maybe she saw something!

39:11.436 --> 39:13.481
She--she was looking
right at you, sir!

39:16.092 --> 39:18.486
- Come and help me with this!

39:21.054 --> 39:24.013
- Lift!

39:38.463 --> 39:40.943
Son of a bitch.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.348
- You think we bet
on the right horse?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.655
- Nyet.

40:05.707 --> 40:08.493
- Saya?

40:26.815 --> 40:30.428
Hey.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.821
You're late for family dinner.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.127
That's no good.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.085
Sit.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.968
So...

40:53.538 --> 40:56.802
My three boys, growing up...

40:56.845 --> 40:59.674
they were animals
at the table.

40:59.718 --> 41:02.851
My wife couldn't control them.

41:02.895 --> 41:06.202
They would fight,
not eat their vegetables.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.900
They would throw food.

41:07.943 --> 41:10.511
And I remember...

41:10.555 --> 41:13.645
feeling so exhausted
from a long day...

41:16.125 --> 41:19.433
That I lacked the wherewithal
to endure it.

41:21.130 --> 41:24.743
And now...

41:24.786 --> 41:27.920
That one thing that
I once couldn't endure?

41:31.097 --> 41:35.231
I prize its memory
above all else.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.147
- You've been played.

41:38.191 --> 41:40.759
- Madam Gao can't be trusted.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.898
Killing your wife...

41:52.640 --> 41:54.599
And daughter...

41:54.642 --> 41:57.732
will not bring
my Chico back to me.

41:57.776 --> 42:01.257
But that is not why
we seek revenge, is it?

42:01.301 --> 42:03.695
No.

42:03.738 --> 42:07.481
We merely want to ensure...

42:07.525 --> 42:11.093
that those that wronged us...

42:11.137 --> 42:14.096
suffer...

42:14.140 --> 42:15.141
as we do.

42:15.184 --> 42:16.969
- I didn't tell you
about Maria

42:17.012 --> 42:20.581
because I believed it would
only compound your grief.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.975
Planned to deal
with her myself.

42:23.018 --> 42:26.152
Why make you kill a daughter
to avenge a son?

42:26.195 --> 42:29.068
- You didn't do it
to protect me.

42:29.111 --> 42:32.854
You did it to preserve
your position.

42:37.816 --> 42:40.558
- Run!

42:43.604 --> 42:45.563
- Kill the girl!
