00:02.990 --> 00:05.989
Julie: For five weeks the
twins played as one and then

00:05.990 --> 00:11.119
entered the game together, and
against all odds seemed poised
to make it to the end.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.999
But tonight, the curtain closes
on the sister act.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.989
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:17.990 --> 00:25.829
( Cheers and applause )
>> Previously on "Big Brother":

00:25.830 --> 00:28.409
With the trombonist sitting
first chair...

00:28.410 --> 00:31.999
Steve, you are the new head
of household!

00:32.000 --> 00:38.989
Vanessa convinced him to
target the showmance.

00:38.990 --> 00:38.991
Julia?

00:38.991 --> 00:39.990
You have to.

00:39.991 --> 00:41.989
She's the least likely to win
vetoes.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.989
So Liz-tin went up on the
block.

00:44.990 --> 00:47.989
I've nominated you Austin and
you Liz for eviction.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.989
Looking for a way to keep all
of aus-twin safe...

00:50.990 --> 00:54.989
if we win he will put you up.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.989
A plan was formed to throw
Julia the veto.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.699
If Julia wins she could pull
Liz down and those two votes

01:01.700 --> 01:02.989
could save me.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.989
With an elimination-style
veto competition...

01:05.990 --> 01:09.989
who's ready to play bowlerina!

01:09.990 --> 01:13.989
It seemed like the perfect
opportunity to execute

01:13.990 --> 01:13.991
aus-twin's plans.

01:13.991 --> 01:19.989
If we can eliminate John,
Vanessa, and Steve we can throw

01:19.990 --> 01:22.989
the competition to Julia and
we'll be golden.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.989
Who would you like to challenge?

01:26.990 --> 01:27.990
Austin.

01:27.990 --> 01:27.991
No,.

01:27.991 --> 01:28.990
Trust me, trust me.

01:28.991 --> 01:31.989
The twin made an unexpected
move.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.989
I would like to challenge
Austin.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.989
( Applause )
>> What is happening right now?

01:35.990 --> 01:38.989
She should be pick John.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.989
Is this the conspiracy by the
whole house?

01:40.990 --> 01:41.990
Am I the target?

01:41.990 --> 01:42.990
What is going on.

01:42.991 --> 01:49.989
So Judas had no choice but to
mow down the competition.

01:49.990 --> 01:50.990
Bam!

01:50.991 --> 01:57.119
And take the veto back to the
imaginaryium.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.989
Look what I found.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.989
Judas just won the power of
veto.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.699
And you know what that means?

02:02.700 --> 02:05.949
This entire house needs to be
afraid.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.989
After Julia realized her
mistake...

02:07.990 --> 02:08.990
what's wrong with you?

02:08.990 --> 02:09.990
I trusted her.

02:09.991 --> 02:11.989
The twins confronted Vanessa.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.409
I feel like I got played.

02:13.410 --> 02:13.990
By me?

02:13.991 --> 02:21.991
But the poker player wouldn't
fold.

02:22.990 --> 02:24.989
At the veto meet ago.

02:24.990 --> 02:29.989
I have decided to use the
power of veto to save myself.

02:29.990 --> 02:32.989
It was double trouble for the
twins.

02:32.990 --> 02:35.989
Julia, I'm so sorry.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.989
Tonight the roommates will be
split up.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.999
Will Liz or Julia be sent to
jury?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.989
Plus the final five begin a
battle for power.

02:42.990 --> 02:47.989
All this live on "Big Brother"!

02:47.990 --> 02:50.989
I'm Judas.

02:50.990 --> 02:58.990

03:26.990 --> 03:30.989
( cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Good evening.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.989
I'm Julie chen.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.539
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:35.540 --> 03:38.989
It was a tumultuous week for the
houseguests as Steve made one of

03:38.990 --> 03:45.989
the biggest moves of the summer,
taking a shot at the aus-twins

03:45.990 --> 03:47.989
and sending the house into
complete chaos.

03:47.990 --> 03:51.989
Tonight, it all culminates as
the twin sisters prepare to say

03:51.990 --> 03:54.989
good-bye to one another.

03:54.990 --> 03:58.119
So will Austin and Liz's
relationship be torn apart as

03:58.120 --> 03:58.950
well?

03:58.951 --> 03:59.989
We'll soon find out.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.699
But first, while three votes
will be cast in tonight's live

04:04.700 --> 04:08.989
eviction, it's looking like
there's only one houseguest in

04:08.990 --> 04:16.990
control of who goes home.

04:21.990 --> 04:25.989
Sitting next to my sister on
the block is the worst-case

04:25.990 --> 04:25.991
scenario.

04:25.991 --> 04:32.699
At this point, we know that one
of us is going home so it really

04:32.700 --> 04:38.990
sucks.

04:39.990 --> 04:44.989
To have two players who were
blindly loyal to each other is a

04:44.990 --> 04:49.989
really scary thing to have so I
have to split this up.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.989
It's great being safe but not
at the expense of my two closest

04:53.990 --> 04:54.990
allies, the twins.

04:54.991 --> 04:56.989
I feel very conflicted about
this.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.989
And I'm really upset for Liz.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.989
You girls cry.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.539
I cried, troo.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.989
I truly and honestly adore the
girls.

05:05.990 --> 05:08.289
However, strategically, this put
me in a much better position

05:08.290 --> 05:10.989
than if all three of them were
here.

05:10.990 --> 05:11.830
I know.

05:11.831 --> 05:15.989
It wasn't fup for anybody.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.989
They've survived seven evictions
together.

05:17.990 --> 05:19.989
That's insane.

05:19.990 --> 05:21.539
Yeah.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.989
The veto meeting is over.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.119
There's tears everywhere.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.989
People are crying.

05:26.990 --> 05:32.989
But I don't really feel bad.

05:32.990 --> 05:36.989
Steve is h.O.H., Vanessa and I
are not on the block.

05:36.990 --> 05:37.990
I'm feeling great right now.

05:37.991 --> 05:40.989
I feel like throwing up,
actually.

05:40.990 --> 05:48.989
Ew, don't do that.

05:48.990 --> 05:51.989
Your makesuprunning?

05:51.990 --> 05:51.991
It is.

05:51.991 --> 05:54.999
I can't see out of my glasses.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.409
There's water all over them.

05:56.410 --> 05:58.989
This is so much harder than I
expected.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.989
I never fathomed one of us would
be leaving.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.989
I don't know why I didn't.

06:03.990 --> 06:11.990
You got this.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
No.

06:16.991 --> 06:23.989
Yes.

06:23.990 --> 06:28.989
This is what I want.

06:28.990 --> 06:35.539
Me leaving over you, because
you played such a good game, and

06:35.540 --> 06:35.990
won so many h.O.H.S.

06:35.991 --> 06:37.989
I feel like you deserve to be
here.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.989
I don't.

06:40.990 --> 06:45.989
I did what I was supposed to do,
switching in and out with you.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.989
You're Liz.

06:48.990 --> 06:54.989
And we made it this far,
you're Julia.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.989
You're not me anymore.

06:56.990 --> 07:01.699
It's not me anymore.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.119
If it were Austin on the
block next to me, I would be

07:05.120 --> 07:07.289
fighting so hard to stay.

07:07.290 --> 07:11.989
But the fact that it's Julia
sitting next to me, I can't

07:11.990 --> 07:14.989
really do much.

07:14.990 --> 07:15.990
If.

07:15.991 --> 07:18.989
If I do leave this game, I'm
definitely going to leave with

07:18.990 --> 07:22.989
my integrity, and I would never
say one bad thing about my twin.

07:22.990 --> 07:28.989
I just can't.

07:28.990 --> 07:36.990
I know.

07:44.990 --> 07:47.989
Look at you drinking calories
and everything.

07:47.990 --> 07:50.989
I drink my protein every time.

07:50.990 --> 07:51.990
You're going to come out of
here a beast.

07:51.991 --> 07:55.989
That's the goal.

07:55.990 --> 07:59.989
Dude, I can't believe we made
it this far.

07:59.990 --> 07:59.991
Right.

07:59.991 --> 08:03.949
They've got to know they're
still a big target, right?

08:03.950 --> 08:04.989
Did you hear his speech today?

08:04.990 --> 08:05.990
Yeah.

08:05.991 --> 08:09.989
While my heart tells me use
this veto to save Liz, my head

08:09.990 --> 08:13.989
is telling me if I do that, then
I might not be here to fight for

08:13.990 --> 08:16.989
her anymore.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.829
He's got to be here to fight
for her.

08:18.830 --> 08:18.990
Yeah.

08:18.991 --> 08:21.989
Thanks for making it clear.

08:21.990 --> 08:25.989
Do we just keep it simple and
get rid of Liz.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.989
Liz can beat me.

08:27.990 --> 08:28.990
With Julia, I'm a favorite.

08:28.990 --> 08:29.950
Right.

08:29.951 --> 08:32.989
I've been thinking in circles
these past couple of days and a

08:32.990 --> 08:36.409
lot of what you say...
>> it seems pretty clear that

08:36.410 --> 08:39.989
John thinks the better player
playis to have Julia stick

08:39.990 --> 08:42.409
around and Austin wants Liz to
stick around.

08:42.410 --> 08:44.989
That makes me the swing vote.

08:44.990 --> 08:47.949
That puts me in a power position
and it's the way I like it.

08:47.950 --> 08:48.830
I like it.

08:48.831 --> 08:55.290
Keep it simple.

09:03.950 --> 09:05.699
I want to.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.989
I think she's doing a good
job of playing everyone.

09:07.990 --> 09:08.990
I know.

09:08.991 --> 09:14.989
That's the thing.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.989
I think if you go, she thinks
everyone is take her to final

09:17.990 --> 09:18.120
two.

09:18.121 --> 09:22.409
Uh-huh.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.989
You're the only person that
wouldn't take her to final two

09:24.990 --> 09:27.989
because you would take me to the
final two.

09:27.990 --> 09:30.409
That's what my gut's telling me.

09:30.410 --> 09:31.949
Mine, too.

09:31.950 --> 09:36.989
She's up to no good.

09:36.990 --> 09:37.990
Hey.

09:37.990 --> 09:38.990
What's up?

09:38.990 --> 09:39.990
What are you guys doing?

09:39.991 --> 09:45.989
We're having an epiphany,
that's all.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.989
What is your epiphany.

09:47.990 --> 09:48.990
They want her out.

09:48.990 --> 09:49.700
They do.

09:49.701 --> 09:52.989
Liz is the only person that
doesn't take her to the final

09:52.990 --> 09:52.991
two.

09:52.991 --> 09:54.699
I know.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.989
She plays a perfect
manipulation game.

09:56.990 --> 09:57.990
It's good.

09:57.991 --> 10:02.989
But she needs Liz to go out
right now because Liz is the

10:02.990 --> 10:02.991
lynchpin.

10:02.991 --> 10:07.989
She's the one thing she can't
control.

10:07.990 --> 10:12.119
You've got to stay, Liz.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.409
You've got to fight.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.989
I know you can.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.989
Like, you got this.

10:16.990 --> 10:19.999
I know if Liz stays here, she
has a better chance of winning,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.989
and I'm willing to, you know,
give up my game for her.

10:23.990 --> 10:27.989
I'm at peace with my decision,
and I know Liz is going to see

10:27.990 --> 10:28.999
it that way, too.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.989
You and Austin, you better make
it to final two.

10:33.990 --> 10:35.989
We can do it.

10:35.990 --> 10:36.990
We'll die trying.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.999
You have a chance of winning
at the end.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.989
It makes sense.

10:40.990 --> 10:43.119
Cry baby Liz is gone and out the
door.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.699
I am ready for battle.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.989
I have to win this thing for the
both of us.

10:47.990 --> 10:49.949
No more Mr. nice girl.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.989
I'm going to try talking to
Vanessa.

10:51.990 --> 10:52.990
Okay, you're staying.

10:52.991 --> 10:55.989
Yes.

10:55.990 --> 10:58.989
I'm 100% dead set.

10:58.990 --> 11:02.999
Boom!

11:03.000 --> 11:03.990
Bang!

11:03.991 --> 11:07.990
Kaboom!

11:11.410 --> 11:13.989
This is so ( Bleep ) Tough
for me.

11:13.990 --> 11:19.989
I want them to make their own
best decision for them.

11:19.990 --> 11:21.989
I really don't want to influence
it at all.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.409
I just feel terrible.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.989
I just want them to decide and
be happy with it.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.989
Obviously, my vote is going to
go with what the twins want me

11:27.990 --> 11:28.990
to do.

11:28.990 --> 11:29.990
And that's to keep Liz.

11:29.991 --> 11:31.989
Now it's up to Vanessa.

11:31.990 --> 11:36.989
I can see why she would want to
get Liz out as a very strong

11:36.990 --> 11:38.989
female competitor against her.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.989
Julia thinks she wants Liz to
stay.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.409
She said I think you have a
chance to win and I don't think

11:45.410 --> 11:47.829
I do so you should go to.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.999
Once she upons this is what the
twins and I want, I hope she's

11:50.000 --> 11:51.989
votes with us this week.

11:51.990 --> 11:59.990
No matter what, it's not an
easy decision.

12:17.990 --> 12:23.989
Liz if you want to it stay,
you can.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.989
I'm willing to do this.

12:25.990 --> 12:29.949
It's tough because I have to go
against Steve.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.989
He hasn't said it yet.

12:30.990 --> 12:33.989
I'm guessing she's going to want
Julia to stay.

12:33.990 --> 12:35.989
To minimize the odds that
someone goes after him.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.409
You understand that.

12:37.410 --> 12:37.990
Yes.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.989
Now that I know where
everyone stands I'm thinking the

12:40.990 --> 12:43.989
best move might be to give the
twins what they want so they

12:43.990 --> 12:45.989
don't create too many enemies
right now.

12:45.990 --> 12:48.289
However in order to feel okay
doing that I'd need to make some

12:48.290 --> 12:51.989
kind of deal with Austin and Liz
that secures my safety next week

12:51.990 --> 12:55.989
going into final five with them.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.989
That being said these are the
three things I would ask for.

12:57.990 --> 13:01.989
Part one, if either of you win
h.O.H., I would expect the other

13:01.990 --> 13:04.989
two to be out the front door.

13:04.990 --> 13:05.410
Uh-huh.

13:05.411 --> 13:09.949
And if I do go up as a
replacement nominee I am staying

13:09.950 --> 13:11.989
and going to final four.

13:11.990 --> 13:12.700
100%.

13:12.701 --> 13:14.989
That's the first part of the
deal.

13:14.990 --> 13:18.949
The second part of the deal is
if nominations stay the same and

13:18.950 --> 13:21.989
it's Steve or Johnny Mac, it
gets to be my call which one

13:21.990 --> 13:22.990
stays.

13:22.991 --> 13:25.989
And my thirds thing is if I end
up in final three with either of

13:25.990 --> 13:29.989
you guys without the other one
there, you need to choose me to

13:29.990 --> 13:30.990
go to finals.

13:30.991 --> 13:34.989
Wait a second, Vanessa, I
can't believe she's asking us to

13:34.990 --> 13:37.119
follow through on all these
things and I'm just shaking my

13:37.120 --> 13:39.989
head in agreement to stay this
week but I have no intention of

13:39.990 --> 13:41.989
following through on those
conditions.

13:41.990 --> 13:42.410
No way.

13:42.411 --> 13:43.989
That seems fair, right?

13:43.990 --> 13:47.990
Yeah.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.989
Want to talk about life on
the other side?

13:59.990 --> 14:00.990
Sure.

14:00.991 --> 14:05.539
So tell me what you're going to
do during your first hour out?

14:05.540 --> 14:08.989
Get attacked by my mother.

14:08.990 --> 14:10.829
That will probably take about an
hour.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.989
Oh!

14:12.990 --> 14:15.989
Do you think Liz is going?

14:15.990 --> 14:19.989
I'll vote anyway you want, if
you feel strongly either way,

14:19.990 --> 14:20.990
100% I'll vote that way.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.990
I don't know yet.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.989
Literally, then I don't know.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.989
What's the better from your
perspective.

14:26.990 --> 14:29.989
I'll do the whole analysis for
you, pros and cons.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.539
Pros of keeping Julia.

14:31.540 --> 14:32.989
I'm more likely to win h.O.H.

14:32.990 --> 14:33.830
Next week.

14:33.830 --> 14:33.990
Okay.

14:33.991 --> 14:36.949
Against her than against Liz
I believe.

14:36.950 --> 14:36.990
Yup.

14:36.991 --> 14:41.409
I'm getting rid of someone
who I couldn't beat in finals.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.989
And keeping someone who I can
beat in finals.

14:43.990 --> 14:46.119
Yup.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.989
Theoretically, it's better,
although the way this game works

14:49.990 --> 14:53.989
it might actually be worse as
you'll see from my pros of

14:53.990 --> 14:54.830
keeping Liz.

14:54.831 --> 14:58.699
The con of keeping Julia, anyone
is incentivized to bring her

14:58.700 --> 14:59.989
over me to final three.

14:59.990 --> 15:00.990
Right.

15:00.991 --> 15:04.989
And you're just afraid of Julia
getting victoriad.

15:04.990 --> 15:10.989
So that's that would be the
only concern with Julia.

15:10.990 --> 15:14.119
Is that sitting on the block
next to her could be a

15:14.120 --> 15:14.990
challenge?

15:14.990 --> 15:15.830
You didn't think about this.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.989
That is a scenario I haven't
thought of.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.989
I know what I told Austin and
Liz at this point but I'm just

15:19.990 --> 15:23.949
wondering if it's smart to keep
someone in the house that at the

15:23.950 --> 15:25.989
end of the day I can't beat if
finals.

15:25.990 --> 15:31.989
This seems like a $500,000
decision it seems scary to leave
Liz in the game.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.999
To go on the block next to
Julia.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.989
Do you see what I'm saying?

15:35.990 --> 15:41.409
It's a hard decision.

15:41.410 --> 15:43.989
Julie: Coming up, after
being cut off from the outside

15:43.990 --> 15:49.989
world for 85 days, the
houseguests guest some love from
home.

15:49.990 --> 15:53.989
Then, the twins may have been in
control for a good deal of the

15:53.990 --> 15:56.989
game, but all good things must
come to an end.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.699
Liz or Julia?

15:58.700 --> 16:00.989
Who will stay and who will go?

16:00.990 --> 16:02.989
Stay with us.

16:02.990 --> 16:03.990
( Cheers and applause )

16:35.990 --> 16:37.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

16:37.990 --> 16:41.539
Let's head to the living room
and talk to the houseguests.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.120
Hello, houseguests.

16:42.121 --> 16:44.289
Hi, Julie!

16:44.290 --> 16:45.989
Julie: How is everyone
doing tonight?

16:45.990 --> 16:47.829
Great!

16:47.830 --> 16:51.989
Julie: Well, you have
officially been inside the house

16:51.990 --> 16:53.989
for 85 days.

16:53.990 --> 16:53.991
Yup.

16:53.991 --> 16:56.989
Julie: I think it's pretty
safe to say this is the longest

16:56.990 --> 17:00.409
amount of time you've all been
away from your loved ones, yes.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.989
Yes, yes, yes!

17:02.990 --> 17:05.989
Julie: John, let me ask
you, what cow thinks any through

17:05.990 --> 17:08.989
the mind of your friends ask
your family as they're at home

17:08.990 --> 17:10.989
watching you play "Big Brother"?

17:10.990 --> 17:13.989
They're like, "wow, he is
really, really stupid and

17:13.990 --> 17:15.539
measing everything up."

17:15.540 --> 17:18.989
Julie: Well, wow, you're
still in there after 85 days so

17:18.990 --> 17:19.990
you're doing something right,
no?

17:19.991 --> 17:21.989
Yeah.

17:21.990 --> 17:24.989
( Laughter ) ( Laughs ).

17:24.990 --> 17:26.829
Julie: Well, we have a
surprise for everyone.

17:26.830 --> 17:28.989
Yay!

17:28.990 --> 17:31.989
Julie: Here are some
special wishes from home.

17:31.990 --> 17:32.990
Take a look.

17:32.991 --> 17:34.989
Hi, John.

17:34.990 --> 17:38.949
I'm having a great summer
watching ow "Big Brother."

17:38.950 --> 17:39.989
Hey, bud.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.989
We've been missing you, but I've
been following you on the

17:42.990 --> 17:43.410
computer.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.120
Keep up the good work.

17:44.120 --> 17:44.990
You're doing great.

17:44.991 --> 17:46.989
What the hell, man!

17:46.990 --> 17:49.539
We were supposed to have this
whole summer together and you

17:49.540 --> 17:53.989
just leave me for five00ed k.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.289
Come on, man.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.989
Rock on!

17:56.990 --> 17:58.989
Austin we all miss you so
much around here.

17:58.990 --> 18:03.949
It is definitely not the same
out here without you.

18:03.950 --> 18:07.539
Keep up the good work, you're
killing it.

18:07.540 --> 18:07.990
These little guys.

18:07.991 --> 18:09.289
Send their love.

18:09.290 --> 18:12.989
Hi, baby, I just want to let
you know how proud I am of you.

18:12.990 --> 18:16.949
I love you so much, and always
remember that you're a winner to

18:16.950 --> 18:18.699
me no matter what happens.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.989
We really, really miss you and,
we're counting down the days

18:21.990 --> 18:23.989
until we see you.

18:23.990 --> 18:23.991
Mwa!

18:23.991 --> 18:25.699
Oh!

18:25.700 --> 18:29.989
Hi, we love you, we miss you
so much back in Miami.

18:29.990 --> 18:33.989
Everyone's rooting for you, and
we're team nolan twins all the

18:33.990 --> 18:33.991
way.

18:33.991 --> 18:34.990
I miss you terribly.

18:34.991 --> 18:38.989
Your mother is here, and me are
all alone and you're not here to

18:38.990 --> 18:38.991
protect me.

18:38.991 --> 18:41.989
We're looking forward to seeing
you all.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.409
Have a good time out in
California.

18:43.410 --> 18:43.990
Hi, Steve.

18:43.991 --> 18:46.989
I'm so happy for this chance to
talk to you right now.

18:46.990 --> 18:49.989
Dad, Jerry, Allen and your
entire family are so very proud

18:49.990 --> 18:50.990
of you.

18:50.990 --> 18:51.990
We believe in you.

18:51.990 --> 18:52.950
You can do this.

18:52.951 --> 18:54.409
We're going to see you very
soon.

18:54.410 --> 19:02.410
And, Steve, I love you so much.

19:02.990 --> 19:06.989
Julie: Steve, I know it's
emotional for you, obviously.

19:06.990 --> 19:09.989
Can you put into word what it's
like seeing your mom after being

19:09.990 --> 19:11.289
away from her for 85 days?

19:11.290 --> 19:12.989
No.

19:12.990 --> 19:13.990
No, I can't.

19:13.991 --> 19:18.989
It's just... I've never... my
family is everything to me in my

19:18.990 --> 19:22.989
life, and it's just... this is...
I've never done anything like

19:22.990 --> 19:24.989
this where I've been so far from
them.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.989
I can't believe I'm still here
after 85 days.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.699
It's just everything to see her
right now.

19:29.700 --> 19:29.990
It's everything.

19:29.991 --> 19:31.989
Julie: Well, they're
pulling for you.

19:31.990 --> 19:32.950
Thank you.

19:32.951 --> 19:34.989
Julie: Vanessa, what does
it mean to you to get a message

19:34.990 --> 19:36.989
like that, this late in the
game?

19:36.990 --> 19:37.990
Oh, man.

19:37.991 --> 19:40.989
First of all, my girlfriend is
gorgeous.

19:40.990 --> 19:41.990
And my dogs are amazing.

19:41.991 --> 19:45.989
They're passed out next to her
it's so cute.

19:45.990 --> 19:50.989
But it's really hard to keep the
game face on in here and it

19:50.990 --> 19:54.409
just, like, that breaks my heart
and remind me why I'm here,
I love her and miss her so much.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.989
Julie: I'm sure it's a nice
shot in the arm for all of you.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.989
Thank you, houseguests.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.989
I'll be back for the live vote
and eviction.

20:02.990 --> 20:06.989
Julie: Last week's double
eviction not only surprised the
houseguests.

20:06.990 --> 20:07.990
It shocked want jurors as well.

20:07.991 --> 20:12.989
Then, it's the end of the road
for Liz or Julia.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.539
The live vote and eviction when
we return.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.540
Stay with us.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

20:41.990 --> 20:46.289
It came as no shock to Meg when
she was the first houseguest

20:46.290 --> 20:49.989
sent packing during last week's
double eviction, but the person

20:49.990 --> 20:52.699
who followed her out the door
was the one fortune she was

20:52.700 --> 20:56.989
hoping not to see until finale
night.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.989
So who do you guys think is
going to walk through that door?

21:00.990 --> 21:03.409
It depends who wins h.O.H.

21:03.410 --> 21:06.989
If John won h.O.H., I think
he probably put up Austin and

21:06.989 --> 21:07.700
I think so, too.

21:07.701 --> 21:11.989
I'm so proud of Johnny Mac
and, man, oh, man, I do hope he

21:11.990 --> 21:14.989
won that h.O.H. And I hope he
makes big moves this week.

21:14.990 --> 21:16.119
Vanessa is a wild card.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.989
So if Vanessa won, we could be
seeing anyone.

21:18.990 --> 21:22.989
Exactly.

21:22.990 --> 21:28.989
I mean, I'd hate to see, you
know, Meg and James, of course.

21:28.990 --> 21:33.989
Oh!

21:33.990 --> 21:34.990
Hi!

21:34.991 --> 21:36.989
My eviction came as a surprise
to me.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.989
I think socially, yes, I was a
threat in the house.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.699
I really did get along with
everyone.

21:41.700 --> 21:45.539
But competition-wise, we all
know I was not a threat.

21:45.540 --> 21:45.990
Vanessa.

21:45.991 --> 21:47.989
She put James and me up.

21:47.990 --> 21:49.989
There's another person coming.

21:49.990 --> 21:50.990
What!

21:50.990 --> 21:51.950
I knew it!

21:51.950 --> 21:52.830
I knew it!

21:52.831 --> 21:54.289
I knew it was a double.

21:54.290 --> 21:59.989
You are never going to
believe what happened.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.989
Whoo!

22:01.990 --> 22:01.991
Yes!

22:01.991 --> 22:03.989
Vanessa is the new head of
household.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.990
That was great for her.

22:04.991 --> 22:08.119
The houseguest who hides
their veto card the pest will

22:08.120 --> 22:12.989
win the power of veto.

22:12.990 --> 22:17.949
Amazing.

22:17.950 --> 22:20.989
Congratulations, James, you
have won the golden power of

22:20.990 --> 22:21.700
veto.

22:21.700 --> 22:21.990
James, man.

22:21.991 --> 22:23.989
He always has these moments.

22:23.990 --> 22:24.990
Yeah.

22:24.990 --> 22:25.990
Oh, man, he needed that.

22:25.991 --> 22:27.989
No kidding.

22:27.990 --> 22:33.409
Julie: By a vote of 4-1,
Meg, you are evicted from the

22:33.410 --> 22:33.990
"Big Brother" house.

22:33.990 --> 22:34.990
Thanks, guys.

22:34.991 --> 22:38.699
I wonder who that one vote was?

22:38.700 --> 22:40.949
I wonder.

22:40.950 --> 22:43.989
I'm dying if he walks in that
door today.

22:43.990 --> 22:48.289
I can't even.

22:48.290 --> 22:51.989
If they send both of us home.

22:51.990 --> 22:53.989
What are you guys doing!

22:53.990 --> 22:54.950
James!

22:54.951 --> 22:55.989
Oh, my God!

22:55.990 --> 22:58.989
I thought James maybe could
have won, worked something out

22:58.990 --> 22:59.990
and saved himself.

22:59.991 --> 23:03.989
But it really sucks to see both
of them here on the same day.

23:03.990 --> 23:04.990
James!

23:04.991 --> 23:06.989
Oh, my God!

23:06.990 --> 23:08.989
Come here, come here.

23:08.990 --> 23:10.949
I'm definitely happy that Meg is
here.

23:10.950 --> 23:14.989
You know, I aggravated her for
75 days in the "Big Brother"

23:14.989 --> 23:15.989
It's continuing in the jury
house.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.539
I am so mad at you!

23:17.540 --> 23:17.990
Who won?

23:17.991 --> 23:21.989
I can sit here and explain it
all, but let's just watch it on

23:21.990 --> 23:23.989
d.V.D.

23:23.990 --> 23:23.991
Play.

23:23.991 --> 23:25.989
Julie: The correct answer
is false.

23:25.990 --> 23:29.989
I need James and Steve to reset
and step down.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.989
Congratulations, Liz, you are
the new head of household.

23:32.990 --> 23:34.119
That's what happened.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.989
I knew I was going up on the
block.

23:36.990 --> 23:38.539
Julie: 17 is the score to
beat.

23:38.540 --> 23:42.989
James gahead and take your first
shot.

23:42.990 --> 23:43.990
Oh, tricky.

23:43.990 --> 23:44.990
Julie: Zero.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.989
I went too light, and I
couldn't make anything.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.989
Well, you look really good in
your pink shorts.

23:49.990 --> 23:50.990
I really like them.

23:50.991 --> 23:52.699
He wore them especially for me.

23:52.700 --> 23:52.990
I like the fit.

23:52.990 --> 23:53.990
Thank you.

23:53.991 --> 23:56.829
Julie: A big
congratulations goes to Julia.

23:56.830 --> 23:57.000
You have won the power of veto.

23:57.001 --> 23:59.989
Man, I'm living a bad
nightmare all over again.

23:59.990 --> 24:00.990
I know.

24:00.991 --> 24:04.989
Vanessa, Steve, and Johnny
Mac are just like kids running

24:04.990 --> 24:06.989
around. The aus-twins are
controlling the house.

24:06.990 --> 24:09.539
If you make one mad, you're
going to make all of them mad,

24:09.540 --> 24:11.989
and they're all coming down on
you.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.989
Julie: James, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

24:13.990 --> 24:15.989
house.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.289
They knew if they kept me in
this house I was taking one of

24:18.290 --> 24:18.990
them out.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.989
I'm still rooting for my
Johnny Mac and my Stevie b.

24:22.990 --> 24:25.699
But, Vanessa, man, she is
running this house really well,

24:25.700 --> 24:29.989
and she is working her butt off
to be the last to up there, and

24:29.990 --> 24:30.990
I think she deserves it.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.829
I'm livid that you're here.

24:32.830 --> 24:32.990
Un that.

24:32.991 --> 24:36.949
I need a couple of days to
decompress, because I don't

24:36.950 --> 24:36.990
know.

24:36.991 --> 24:39.989
Maybe my jury members might be
plotting against me right now.

24:39.990 --> 24:40.990
I feel it right now.

24:40.991 --> 24:44.989
You have to remember you're in
the jury house, there's no more

24:44.990 --> 24:44.991
plotting.

24:44.991 --> 24:47.989
We just have to come up with a
good decision who wins $500,000.

24:47.990 --> 24:50.289
Can we have wine now?

24:50.290 --> 24:52.989
Wine and whiskey equals
lingerie parties.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.699
Oh, my God!

24:54.700 --> 24:56.989
James!

24:56.990 --> 25:01.539
Julie: With the addition of
Meg and James, the jury

25:01.540 --> 25:04.989
continues to grow, and now
either Liz or Julia will join

25:04.990 --> 25:04.991
them.

25:04.991 --> 25:08.989
Let's head to the living room
and see who will be the next

25:08.990 --> 25:11.989
resident of the jury house.

25:11.990 --> 25:14.409
Houseguests, it's time for the
live vote.

25:14.410 --> 25:19.989
Liz, Julia, in just moments,
your housemates will cast their

25:19.990 --> 25:23.989
votes to evict live, bubefore
they do, you each have a final

25:23.990 --> 25:26.989
chance to sway their votes with
one brief statement.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.989
Liz, you're first.

25:28.990 --> 25:34.119
Julia, I am still shocked
that we have made it this far.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.989
One of our first goals coming
into this game was to make it to

25:36.990 --> 25:40.699
the point where we could play
together as individuals.

25:40.700 --> 25:41.989
We've learned so much more about
each other.

25:41.990 --> 25:44.989
For instance, we both get scared
very easily.

25:44.990 --> 25:46.989
I cry way more than you.

25:46.990 --> 25:49.989
And we can't necessarily fool 15
other houseguests that we are

25:49.990 --> 25:51.989
one person.

25:51.990 --> 25:52.990
Well, except for Jace.

25:52.991 --> 25:57.699
I just want to let you know that
no man... sorry, Austin... or any

25:57.700 --> 26:00.989
amount of money will ever come
in between our bond.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.989
True love, in my opinion, is
when you love someone more than

26:03.990 --> 26:08.699
you love yourself, and I am so
lucky that I have that with you.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.989
Houseguests, whichever one of
stays, we are going to fight for

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
each other like no other.

26:12.991 --> 26:16.989
I love you so much, and twin
team for life.

26:16.990 --> 26:18.989
Julie: That was beautiful.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.989
Can you top that, Julia?

26:20.990 --> 26:21.830
No.

26:21.831 --> 26:22.989
Julie: Well, it's your
turn.

26:22.990 --> 26:22.991
Okay.

26:22.991 --> 26:25.989
I'm going to make this short and
sweet because I don't want to

26:25.990 --> 26:26.999
cry anymore.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.989
All our lives, we have pretty
much done everything together.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.999
We came into this world
together.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.989
We've literally gone to all the
same schools together.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.989
And now we're sitting on block
together.

26:38.990 --> 26:40.989
Unfortunately, it's come to the
point of the game where only one

26:40.990 --> 26:42.989
of us can move forward.

26:42.990 --> 26:46.989
And I am so proud of the game
you played thus far.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.409
You are incredible.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.539
You beat me fair and square
during the double eviction,

26:51.540 --> 26:51.990
h.O.H., okay.

26:51.991 --> 26:54.989
I'm not going to lie.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.949
And you are... if you stay in
this house, are you going to

26:58.950 --> 27:01.119
fight to the end for the both of
us.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.989
Houseguests, thank you for the
most incredible summer of my

27:03.990 --> 27:03.991
life.

27:03.991 --> 27:06.989
And I will cherish these
memories forever.

27:06.990 --> 27:07.990
Thank you.

27:07.991 --> 27:09.289
Julie: Thank you, Julia.

27:09.290 --> 27:10.999
Thank you, both.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.829
It's time for the live vote to
begin.

27:13.830 --> 27:16.989
Steve, as head of household, you
are not allowed to vote.

27:16.990 --> 27:18.989
Neither are the two nominees.

27:18.990 --> 27:22.989
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

27:22.990 --> 27:24.989
cast your vote to evict.

27:24.990 --> 27:25.990
Austin, you're up first.

27:25.991 --> 27:31.989
Please go to the diary room.

27:31.990 --> 27:35.949
Austin has pledged his love to
Liz.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.409
Will he pledge his vote to her
as well?

27:38.410 --> 27:38.990
Hi, Austin.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.989
Hello, Julie.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:42.990 --> 27:46.989
Sadly, I vote to evict Julia.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.989
Julie: Thank you.

27:48.990 --> 27:48.991
Thank you.

27:48.991 --> 27:51.989
Julie: Vanessa knows
keeping Liz is a gamble, but she

27:51.990 --> 27:54.989
is a poker player.

27:54.990 --> 27:55.990
Hi, Vanessa.

27:55.990 --> 27:56.990
Hi, Julie.

27:56.991 --> 27:57.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.989
Sadly, I vote to evict Julia.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.989
Julie: Thank you.

28:05.990 --> 28:09.989
It's official, with two votes to
evict Julia, Julia will leave

28:09.990 --> 28:10.990
the house tonight.

28:10.991 --> 28:13.989
But let's see how John votes.

28:13.990 --> 28:14.830
Hi, John.

28:14.831 --> 28:15.989
Hey, girl!

28:15.990 --> 28:16.990
( Laughter ).

28:16.990 --> 28:17.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:17.991 --> 28:20.989
I vote to evict Julia.

28:20.990 --> 28:21.830
Julie: Thank you.

28:21.831 --> 28:23.989
Yeah.

28:23.990 --> 28:31.990
( Laughter )
>> Julie: All of the vote are

28:35.990 --> 28:39.989
in, and with three votes to
evict Julia, Julia will leave

28:39.990 --> 28:42.949
the house tonight and join the
jury.

28:42.950 --> 28:45.949
When we return, we'll give the
news to the houseguests.

28:45.950 --> 28:48.989
Then the power is back up for
grabs, and with less than two

28:48.990 --> 28:52.699
weeks left in the game, this
head of household competition is

28:52.700 --> 28:54.989
a crucial must-win for everyone.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.989
Stay with us.

28:56.990 --> 28:58.990
( Cheers and applause )

29:33.990 --> 29:34.990
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

29:34.991 --> 29:38.409
By a vote of 3-0, the
houseguests have just voted to

29:38.410 --> 29:40.409
evict Julia.

29:40.410 --> 29:44.989
Let's return to the living room
and reveal the results of the

29:44.990 --> 29:45.990
vote.

29:45.990 --> 29:46.990
Houseguests, the votes are in.

29:46.991 --> 29:49.989
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

29:49.990 --> 29:54.829
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather her belongings,

29:54.830 --> 29:55.989
and walk out the front door.

29:55.990 --> 30:02.989
By a vote of 3-0, Julia, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

30:02.990 --> 30:06.989
house.

30:06.990 --> 30:08.989
I love you so much.

30:08.990 --> 30:11.989
I love you guys, all of you.

30:11.990 --> 30:13.989
Good luck.

30:13.990 --> 30:21.990
I don't want to cry.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.989
Liz, stop crying.

30:24.990 --> 30:30.989
I love you.

30:30.990 --> 30:31.990
Go kill it.

30:31.990 --> 30:31.991
Okay.

30:31.991 --> 30:33.119
I love you!

30:33.120 --> 30:39.409
I love you guys.

30:39.410 --> 30:39.990
Upon.

30:39.991 --> 30:47.991
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Hi, Julia.

30:50.540 --> 30:55.989
Welcome, have a seat.

30:55.990 --> 30:59.829
That was a really, really,
really touching speech, though.

30:59.830 --> 31:07.830
Thank you.

31:22.990 --> 31:26.989
Julie: Julia, you and your
twin sister, Liz, made the

31:26.990 --> 31:27.990
decision, she should be the one
to stay.

31:27.991 --> 31:30.989
You should be the one evicted.

31:30.990 --> 31:30.991
Yes.

31:30.991 --> 31:31.990
Julie: Why?

31:31.991 --> 31:35.989
Well, Julie, she has played
an incredible game.

31:35.990 --> 31:36.999
I am so proud of her.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.989
She has won three h.O.H.S, and
I feel like at this point in the

31:39.990 --> 31:42.699
game, you know, I would be
playing for second, and she's

31:42.700 --> 31:42.990
playing for first.

31:42.991 --> 31:45.989
And I feel like she deserves to
stay in the game.

31:45.990 --> 31:49.539
Julie: So did the others
make a mistake by keeping her

31:49.540 --> 31:51.989
and not you because she's won a
lot?

31:51.990 --> 31:52.990
Right.

31:52.991 --> 31:54.989
She has won a lot but, you know,
we're very close with the rest

31:54.990 --> 31:59.539
of the houseguests, and, you
know, we... they respected our

31:59.540 --> 32:02.989
decision, and I mean, they might
have made a mistake because she

32:02.990 --> 32:05.989
is a fierce competitor, and she
has Austin, so that's another

32:05.990 --> 32:08.699
great thing, but I'm confident,
you know, she's going to make it

32:08.700 --> 32:08.990
to the end.

32:08.991 --> 32:10.989
I hope she does.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.989
Julie: Let's talk about the
veto competition because going

32:12.990 --> 32:17.119
into it, you, your sister, and
Austin decided that they would

32:17.120 --> 32:18.989
try and throw it to you.

32:18.990 --> 32:19.540
Yes.

32:19.541 --> 32:21.989
Julie: But then in round
two, you took Vanessa's advice

32:21.990 --> 32:25.989
and you picked to face off
against Austin.

32:25.990 --> 32:25.991
Yes.

32:25.991 --> 32:28.539
Julie: Why did you do that?

32:28.540 --> 32:32.989
Well, at that moment, I was
just thinking, you know,

32:32.990 --> 32:36.289
worst-case scenario is if Austin
wins this veto and then I'm

32:36.290 --> 32:39.289
going to go on the block next to
my sister, I was just thinking,

32:39.290 --> 32:41.949
you know, I don't want to be on
the block next to my sister.

32:41.950 --> 32:45.829
So I just decided, you know, he
doesn't have really good

32:45.830 --> 32:45.990
eyesight.

32:45.991 --> 32:50.989
I thought I could challenge him
and, you know, he beat me fair

32:50.990 --> 32:51.990
and square.

32:51.991 --> 32:53.999
Julie: Do you regret
picking him so early in that

32:54.000 --> 32:54.990
competition?

32:54.991 --> 32:57.989
I would definitely take it
back now, looking back on the

32:57.990 --> 32:59.989
it, I definitely would.

32:59.990 --> 33:02.989
But, you know, no regrets.

33:02.990 --> 33:03.990
So...
>> Julie: He started a

33:03.990 --> 33:04.990
relationship with your sister.

33:04.991 --> 33:07.699
What are your thoughts on that?

33:07.700 --> 33:07.990
( Laughter ).

33:07.990 --> 33:08.990
He is a great guy.

33:08.991 --> 33:11.989
I love him to death, you know.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.539
He also when he started a
relationship with my sister, I

33:14.540 --> 33:16.989
kind of joined in because, you
know, when you date one twin

33:16.990 --> 33:19.989
you've got to, you know, be with
the other one.

33:19.990 --> 33:22.989
You know, you have to put up
with the other one.

33:22.990 --> 33:24.699
Julie: You sign on.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.410
Exactly.

33:25.411 --> 33:26.989
Julie: You have to support.

33:26.990 --> 33:27.290
Yes.

33:27.291 --> 33:28.989
Julie: So you support this
relationship?

33:28.990 --> 33:30.989
I definitely support this
relationship.

33:30.990 --> 33:33.989
Me and him have had our fair
share of moments, but I love
him.

33:33.990 --> 33:35.989
He's a great guy for her.

33:35.990 --> 33:38.989
So I approve this message.

33:38.990 --> 33:38.991
( Laughter ).

33:38.991 --> 33:41.989
Julie: In the event, Julia,
that you were the one voted out

33:41.990 --> 33:44.989
tonight, your housemates taped
some good-bye messages.

33:44.990 --> 33:45.540
Let's watch and listen.

33:45.540 --> 33:45.990
Oh, okay.

33:45.991 --> 33:50.989
Julia, if you're watching it,
it means I'm really sad that I

33:50.990 --> 33:53.119
couldn't send both you and your
sister at the same time.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.989
I mean, you both evicted me, and
hopefully I'm going to send

33:56.990 --> 33:59.989
every single one of your
alliance members out after you.

33:59.990 --> 34:00.990
Have fun in jury, though.

34:00.990 --> 34:01.990
Hi, Julia.

34:01.991 --> 34:07.829
It's been a lot of fun being
very sneaky with you and the

34:07.830 --> 34:12.949
scamper squad this summer and I
am so sorry it came dune to

34:12.950 --> 34:12.990
this.

34:12.991 --> 34:14.989
We will be in touch soon.

34:14.990 --> 34:17.989
Jawlia, I promise you I will
not cry.

34:17.990 --> 34:18.990
I love you so much.

34:18.991 --> 34:20.989
I cannot believe we made it this
far and we are so lucky we had
each other.

34:20.990 --> 34:24.989
I am going to fight with every
bone in my body for us and I am

34:24.990 --> 34:27.989
going to win this thing in your
honor.

34:27.990 --> 34:30.989
I miss you already,.

34:30.990 --> 34:33.989
Julia, I am so sorry I could
not protect and you your sister

34:33.990 --> 34:34.990
to the end of the game.

34:34.990 --> 34:35.990
That's all I wanted.

34:35.991 --> 34:39.989
As soon as I found out you guys
were twins I did everything in

34:39.990 --> 34:41.989
my power to keep you guys safe.

34:41.990 --> 34:44.289
I love your sister with all my
heart and I hope to see you

34:44.290 --> 34:46.989
maybe at Christmas dinner with
the family.

34:46.990 --> 34:46.991
( Laughter ).

34:46.991 --> 34:50.539
Julie: Do you think they're
going to make it all the way to

34:50.540 --> 34:50.990
Christmas?

34:50.991 --> 34:52.989
I definitely think they will
make it to Christmas.

34:52.990 --> 34:57.989
Julie: Do you think he
could potentially be your future

34:57.990 --> 34:57.991
brother-in-law.

34:57.991 --> 35:00.989
That's a long shot, but you
know what...

35:00.990 --> 35:02.989
( laughter ) Yes, I do.

35:02.989 --> 35:04.119
Julie: You think there's a
chance?

35:04.120 --> 35:05.699
There's a chance, yes.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.699
You know, "Big Brother" love
lasts.

35:08.700 --> 35:08.990
Julie: It has happened.

35:08.990 --> 35:09.990
It has happened.

35:09.991 --> 35:13.989
Julie: Well, we will see
you back here on Wednesday,

35:13.990 --> 35:17.949
September 23, when you and the
rest of the jury decides who

35:17.950 --> 35:17.990
wins "Big Brother."

35:17.991 --> 35:18.990
Yes.

35:18.990 --> 35:19.990
Julie: Thanks, Julia.

35:19.990 --> 35:20.990
Thank you, Julie.

35:20.991 --> 35:22.989
Julie: You're off to the
jury house now.

35:22.990 --> 35:23.990
Yay!

35:23.991 --> 35:26.989
Julie: Stay right there.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.989
Up next, the power is back up
for grabs, and with the

35:29.990 --> 35:32.989
aus-twins taking a hit tonight a
win for Austin and Liz is a must

35:32.990 --> 35:34.989
if they want to make it to the
end together.

35:34.990 --> 35:35.990
Stay with us.

35:35.991 --> 35:38.990
( Cheers and applause )

35:56.990 --> 35:58.829
Julie: Welcome back to "big "big
brother."

35:58.830 --> 36:00.989
It's now time for the head of
household competition.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.989
Free from the threat of
eviction, the h.O.H. Must

36:03.990 --> 36:05.989
nominate to houseguests for
eviction.

36:05.990 --> 36:10.989
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

36:10.990 --> 36:11.410
Houseguests.

36:11.411 --> 36:13.989
The power is back up for grabs.

36:13.990 --> 36:17.949
Steve, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

36:17.950 --> 36:18.989
to compete.

36:18.990 --> 36:24.699
This competition is called
"under the rainbow" and to win

36:24.700 --> 36:25.989
you're going to need the luck of
the Irish.

36:25.990 --> 36:32.989
On my "go," you will maneuver
your eggs one at a time through

36:32.990 --> 36:37.989
the course and over the rainbow
to the pot of gold on the other

36:37.990 --> 36:37.991
side.

36:37.991 --> 36:42.989
The first houseguest to get 10
eggs safely into their holders

36:42.990 --> 36:45.989
and buzz in will be the new head
of household.

36:45.990 --> 36:51.119
In addition, there is a luxury
prize up for grabs.

36:51.120 --> 36:57.699
You'll see a special egg holder
near the end of your rainbow.

36:57.700 --> 37:04.699
The first houseguest to get an
egg in that holder will win a

37:04.700 --> 37:05.989
once-in-a-lifetime trip outside
of the "Big Brother" house.

37:05.990 --> 37:10.989
But be warned... by going for
this special prize, you could

37:10.990 --> 37:14.989
hinder your chances of winning
head of household.

37:14.990 --> 37:21.539
This competition will be played
until both the h.O.H. And the

37:21.540 --> 37:23.989
