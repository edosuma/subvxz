WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:10.640
<i>Previously on "Queens of Mystery"...</i>

00:10.640 --> 00:14.640
The next director of the
Wildemarsh Wellness Retreat

00:14.640 --> 00:16.200
will be Grace Mulberry.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.280
I can't get out!

00:24.280 --> 00:25.800
Help!

00:25.800 --> 00:26.880
Have you heard?

00:28.280 --> 00:29.560
Where were you last night?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.400
At home.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.520
My sister owns this place,
and I demand to know

00:33.520 --> 00:35.960
what's going on, irregardless.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.200
I heard she won the money

00:39.200 --> 00:41.200
to buy this place
in a poker game.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.200
Cat Stone to see Lucky Jim.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.400
Can you explain why we found

00:45.400 --> 00:47.440
one of your false nails
in the maintenance room

00:47.440 --> 00:49.400
and Grace Mulberry's pass card
in your bedroom?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.600
Someone must have planted them.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.040
"...the formal engagement
of their daughter

00:54.040 --> 00:55.400
to Dr. Daniel Lynch."

00:55.400 --> 00:56.880
- Shall we?
- Please.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.840
Bryant?

00:58.840 --> 01:00.840
Was her husband in the police?

01:02.280 --> 01:03.800
Target on the move.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.280
Yasmin Hayes couldn't have
killed Dr. Isherwood.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.400
I'm her alibi.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.600
Our finances have taken
a bit of a hit recently.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.400
If we close, even temporarily,
it'll sink the place.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.800
The Yasmin Hayes we arrested
isn't who she says she is.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.520
She's using a false name.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.600
She's dead.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.200
<i>Despite knowing there was
a dead body</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:56.480
<i>awaiting his forensic eye,</i>

02:56.480 --> 02:59.080
<i>Dr. Daniel Lynch
was at least grateful</i>

02:59.080 --> 03:01.680
<i>the occasion would allow him
further opportunity</i>

03:01.680 --> 03:03.640
<i>to explain to Matilda</i>

03:03.640 --> 03:07.200
<i>the circumstances surrounding
his recent engagement.</i>

03:11.200 --> 03:12.800
<i>Or so he thought.</i>

03:15.960 --> 03:19.120
Natasha, what are you doing?

03:19.120 --> 03:22.600
I agreed to lend a hand
until the calvary arrived.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.480
Anyway, she was poisoned.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.880
And I'm off for my beauty sleep.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.360
Inspector, Margo.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.200
What do we know
about the deceased?

03:33.200 --> 03:36.080
Unusually, sir, less than
we did an hour ago.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.480
We thought her name
was Yasmin Hayes,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.360
but that turns out to be false.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.400
PC Foster's searching her room
for clues now.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.000
The deceased was undergoing
acupuncture

03:45.000 --> 03:47.400
when she started
having difficulty breathing.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.360
The therapist, Grace Mulberry,
raised the alarm,

03:49.360 --> 03:51.720
but by the time I arrived,
she was dead.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.200
- Your assessment, Dr. Lynch?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.360
Could be poisoning.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.200
Equally, it could be
anaphylactic shock.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.440
I'll know more after
the post mortem.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.400
The evidence suggests
the former.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
It's the packaging
for the acupuncture needles.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.760
There's tiny puncture marks
suggesting a substance

04:12.760 --> 04:14.600
was injected to coat the needle.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.240
And you think this
Grace Mulberry unwittingly

04:16.240 --> 04:18.760
administered it
while performing acupuncture?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.360
It's a theory.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.400
I finished searching
the deceased's room.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.520
There's nothing to suggest
her real identity.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.000
Mobile phone?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.960
There's no sign of it,
but I did find this.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.720
Boss.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.080
Cat Stone.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.680
Well, I knew you couldn't
keep away from here forever.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.200
I'm here for information,
not action.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.520
Well, let's not be hasty.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.040
Sit, please.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.200
You hosted a poker game
about 20 years ago

05:25.200 --> 05:27.720
where a woman called
Angela Isherwood

05:27.720 --> 05:29.640
won half a million
from a high roller.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.080
I remember.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.600
I'd never seen either of them
before, never seen them since.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.720
The high roller was worse
than you.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.480
Bet thousands on hands he didn't
have a chance of winning with.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.480
I need his name.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.400
I could look it up for you,

05:45.400 --> 05:49.520
but my members do so value
their privacy.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.840
Or we could wait till your man
here goes on a break

05:51.840 --> 05:56.200
and I could beat it
out of you.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.200
Or you could change the habit
of a lifetime

05:59.200 --> 06:01.760
and try beating me at poker.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.240
Texas Hold'em or five-card draw?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.960
Five-card draw.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.080
That's me done for the moment.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.600
I'll e-mail you
my initial findings.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.040
Thanks.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.600
About the engagement,
I just want--

06:26.600 --> 06:28.960
Matilda. Dr. Lynch.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.440
Sorry, George, I just need
another minute

06:30.440 --> 06:31.600
with Sergeant Stone.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.640
That's okay, George.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.240
How can I help?

06:34.240 --> 06:36.720
Wondered if I could have a word,
in private.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.920
We're all colleagues here.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.840
Say what you need to say.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.040
I was wondering if you'd like
to go to dinner

06:42.040 --> 06:44.360
with me tomorrow night.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.920
Oh...

06:48.360 --> 06:50.360
Yes, that would be really nice.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.200
Thank you, George.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.560
Great.
I'll be in touch.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.120
Dr. Lynch.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.120
Oh, dear.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.920
Looks as though I'm about
to take all your money again.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.400
I'll see you

07:48.400 --> 07:49.760
and raise you.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.120
Unh-unh,
and the membership book.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.040
I've shown you mine,
now you show me yours.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.600
You bet your precious motorbike
on a pair of lousy queens.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.760
Not just one pair.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.200
You can always count
on four queens

08:34.200 --> 08:35.920
to get you out of trouble.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.440
Now give me that name.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.400
What about your money?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.800
Give it to a gambling charity
of your choice.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.920
You heard the lady.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.880
Have a good day at work.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.480
Sir, I wasn't expecting you.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.080
I know you weren't, Stone,
but...

09:30.080 --> 09:33.600
<i>What Inspector Thorne
wanted to say next was...</i>

09:33.600 --> 09:35.880
I woke up this morning,
and for some inexplicable reason

09:35.880 --> 09:38.520
all I wanna do is...

09:38.520 --> 09:40.040
tango!

09:49.000 --> 09:52.200
<i>But what he chose to say was...</i>

09:52.200 --> 09:53.640
I was passing and wondered
whether you found

09:53.640 --> 09:55.400
- those missing mobiles.
Not yet, sir.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.640
But I've been going through
the phone company records

09:57.640 --> 10:00.080
and it shows that Yasmin Hayes,
or whoever she was,

10:00.080 --> 10:02.920
sent Dr. Isherwood text messages
on the day of her death,

10:02.920 --> 10:05.000
but it doesn't say
what those texts were.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.240
That's very good, Sergeant.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.640
Well done.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.720
Jane.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.080
Inspector.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.440
I'll see you at the station.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.240
We checked Yasmin against
the National Crime Database

10:23.240 --> 10:24.480
when she was arrested.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.760
Her fingerprints
came back negative,

10:25.760 --> 10:27.360
but we're still
waiting on DNA.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.760
Tell the lab to make it
a priority.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.960
- Dr. Lynch.
- No toxicology report yet,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.240
but I thought you
would want to know

10:34.240 --> 10:35.360
that the autopsy
revealed the victim

10:35.360 --> 10:37.720
was a heart transplant
recipient.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.120
The tablets we found
in her room,

10:39.120 --> 10:40.400
could they be
immunosuppressants?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.200
Yes.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.960
Transplant patients have to take
them for life after surgery.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.720
I have a question.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.480
Why can't we use dental records

10:49.480 --> 10:51.400
to find the victim's
real identity?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.440
'Cause they're only used to
crosscheck someone's identity

10:53.440 --> 10:55.400
once there's a name
linked with a body.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.960
There is no national dental
database we can check against.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.760
But there is a national
transplant database.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.400
How long ago do you estimate
Yasmin had her heart transplant?

11:04.400 --> 11:07.120
Judging by the age of her scars,
15 years ago, maybe longer.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.840
Meaning she'd have been
a child at the time.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.400
How many heart transplants
take place each year

11:11.400 --> 11:12.640
on those under 16?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.440
A handful.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.200
If we compile a list
of patients on the database,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.960
we match the victim's profile
at the time --

11:17.960 --> 11:19.240
Then we can cross reference
those names

11:19.240 --> 11:20.640
with her dental records
to find a match.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.000
Exactly.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.440
Well, don't just stand there,
Stone, get on with it.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.440
Where did you learn
to do this stuff?

11:37.440 --> 11:41.720
You'd be amazed what you can
learn at night school.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.400
Why exactly are we breaking
into Dr. Isherwood's office?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.120
Because we need to see
the text messages between her

11:48.120 --> 11:49.880
and Yasmin Hayes
on the day of her death.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.480
We don't have
either of their phones.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.040
We don't need them.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.200
Yes.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.480
I've narrowed down the list

12:03.480 --> 12:05.360
of heart transplant recipients
to 19.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.760
Where do we start?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.880
Contact dental practices
near their home address.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.640
And if the dental records
match the victim,

12:10.640 --> 12:12.360
it will reveal
her real identity.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.600
- Clever.
- Let's get started.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.640
Mobile phones are often
linked to computers

12:17.640 --> 12:20.920
with apps that show
text messages on both devices.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.120
Give me five minutes.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.040
I'm sure
I can bypass the firewall.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.720
Let me.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.880
Dr. Isherwood mentioned her
poor memory when we first met.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.960
People like her
tend to keep a list

12:33.960 --> 12:36.440
of their passwords
close to hand.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.920
Bingo.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.880
Open that picture file.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.760
Oh, who's that naked man?

12:48.760 --> 12:51.480
I'm not certain,
but I think I recognize

12:51.480 --> 12:53.520
that mole on his inner thigh.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.600
- Really?
- What?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.040
I'm widowed, not dead.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.840
I've got a hit.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.200
The dental records match a woman
called Kelly Underfield.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.480
According to
the transplant database,

13:09.480 --> 13:11.680
she received a new heart
20 years ago.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.920
Aged six.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.520
Good work, Foster.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.200
It was Sergeant Stone's idea.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.840
Yes. Well done, Stone.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.720
Terry, dig up everything you can
on Kelly Underfield.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.240
I'm going to the retreat to see
if anyone's heard of her.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.080
Sarge.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.480
And breathe
and stretch.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.800
And breathe and stretch.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.640
And breathe and stretch.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.040
You joining us, ladies?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.680
Could we talk to you?

13:41.680 --> 13:46.000
The breath is
the prana that powers your life.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.240
Take five, ladies, okay?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.920
I'll be back with you.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.960
Care to explain why
the two women

13:51.960 --> 13:55.680
who exchanged this photo
are now both dead?

13:55.680 --> 13:59.000
I admit it, I'm a fraud.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.520
I'm not a ladies man at all.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.960
I married
my childhood sweetheart.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.120
She passed away a few years ago,

14:06.120 --> 14:09.600
and I found myself single
for the first time in my life.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.360
But then I met Yasmin
and for a brief moment

14:15.360 --> 14:18.400
I thought -- who am I kidding?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.280
I don't know what I thought.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.160
And the naked photo?

14:22.160 --> 14:26.480
Yasmin kept asking me
to send her an intimate photo.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.520
Naively, in the end,

14:28.520 --> 14:30.400
I gave her what she wanted.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.240
And I'm guessing that's when
things changed between you.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.640
Yasmin threatened to send
the photo to Dr. Isherwood

14:37.640 --> 14:39.240
unless I gave her money.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.920
But you refused
to be blackmailed?

14:41.920 --> 14:45.360
No, I gave her the money
but it wasn't enough.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.680
She kept squeezing me for more
until I'd used up

14:47.680 --> 14:49.960
my entire life savings,

14:49.960 --> 14:52.600
nearly £7,000.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.280
That evening, Yasmin rang to say

14:54.280 --> 14:58.040
she'd text Dr. Isherwood
the photo.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.000
It was just gone 10:00...

15:00.000 --> 15:01.720
when she rang.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.400
I knew Dr. Isherwood would be
taking her nightly steam

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
and wouldn't have seen it yet.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.880
I crept back in and went through
Dr. Isherwood's locker.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.720
I was going to
delete the picture,

15:12.720 --> 15:15.760
but her phone was locked,

15:15.760 --> 15:20.080
so I took the phone instead.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.960
And what about Yasmin's phone?

15:22.960 --> 15:25.200
I used to my pass card
to enter her room

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
and stole it as she slept.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.000
It's why we were arguing
yesterday.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.960
Yasmin knew I had taken her
phone but couldn't prove it.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.880
Look, I know
what I did was wrong.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.200
I'm an idiot, but that doesn't
make me a killer.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.880
Why do I
get the feeling

15:47.880 --> 15:49.560
you two have been meddling?

15:49.560 --> 15:52.600
We prefer to think of it
as supporting a loved one.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.200
The missing mobiles.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.840
Stephen Swift had them
all along.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.880
I'm going to need more detail.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.080
It's a long story.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.400
Oh, oh, I recognize that mole.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.720
Please don't tell me you've
been supporting me as well.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.200
The high roller Dr. Isherwood
won the money from

16:09.200 --> 16:12.200
for this place, Paul Underfield.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.040
He practically gave her
the cash.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.200
Underfield?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.760
You know him?

16:16.760 --> 16:19.040
Yasmin Hayes' real name
was Kelly Underfield.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.400
Terry?

16:23.400 --> 16:26.000
I've been looking into
Kelly Underfield's whereabouts.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.680
No one's seen her in months.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.960
- Put it on speakerphone.
- No.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.160
Turns out Kelly was the sole
heir to a large inheritance,

16:33.160 --> 16:35.440
but she had blown
through the lot.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.080
And then I looked
at Kelly's bank accounts.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.720
Two lots of £50,000 had been
deposited in the last few weeks.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.600
The second one, on the morning
of Dr. Isherwood's murder,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.480
and both came from
the Wellness Retreat.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.880
Why would Dr. Isherwood
pay Kelly 100 grand?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.400
Good work, Terry.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.840
Well?

16:53.840 --> 16:58.120
Rowena Walker's been keeping
secrets from me.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.760
The payments to Yasmin
are not something

16:59.760 --> 17:01.600
I'm in a position
to talk about.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
Would you rather I brought
in a forensic accountant

17:03.600 --> 17:06.360
while you wait things out
in a prison cell?

17:06.360 --> 17:08.840
No, no, of course not.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.280
Then I need the truth.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.040
It's Alistair.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.600
Dr. Isherwood's brother?

17:26.480 --> 17:30.720
Have you ever experienced
love at first sight, Sergeant?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.360
I might have.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.400
I know we've nothing in common,

17:34.400 --> 17:38.840
but Alistair has a good heart
and that's enough for me.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.760
The only problem is
I've never had the courage

17:40.760 --> 17:42.400
to tell him how I feel.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.640
I can't make out a word
she's saying.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.920
Oh, I need to go.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.720
I'm hosting a party at 3:00.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.200
Mattie's in the middle
of a double murder investigation

17:51.200 --> 17:52.600
and you're hosting a party.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.240
Yes. A face lift party.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.800
Oh, can I come?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.960
Irregardless?

18:03.840 --> 18:05.920
I've always done
the Retreat's books.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.400
Two months ago,
I spotted £50,000

18:08.400 --> 18:10.600
being siphoned out
of the company bank account.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.360
Dr. Isherwood fobbed me off
the first time,

18:12.360 --> 18:14.200
but when it happened again
a few days ago,

18:14.200 --> 18:15.760
I demanded an explanation.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.400
Is that what you
and Dr. Isherwood

18:17.400 --> 18:21.000
were really arguing
about the other day?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.400
Dr. Isherwood wouldn't
tell me why,

18:23.400 --> 18:26.360
but said that Yasmin
was blackmailing Alistair.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.240
- Alistair?
He went to her for help

18:28.240 --> 18:30.720
and she agreed
to pay Yasmin off.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.920
Dr. Isherwood knew I had
feelings for Alistair.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.600
She told me he'd get
into terrible trouble

18:37.600 --> 18:39.400
if I said anything.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.640
You should have told me
the truth when I first asked.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.760
I was worried you'd think he was
caught up in the murders.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.360
And what about you?

18:46.360 --> 18:48.200
You weren't angry with
Dr. Isherwood

18:48.200 --> 18:50.680
for making Grace the next
Retreat director?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.400
Dr. Lynch?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.880
I've had the toxicology
results back

18:57.880 --> 18:59.280
on Kelly Underfield.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.200
It looks like
we were both right.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.920
- Right how?
- She was poisoned

19:02.920 --> 19:05.200
and she died
of anaphylactic shock.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.720
She was injected with bee venom.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.160
Bee venom?

19:08.160 --> 19:09.440
I checked
her medical records.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.400
She was allergic to bee stings.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.440
Thanks, have the report
sent to the station.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.440
Did you say bee venom?

19:21.440 --> 19:22.640
Why?

19:22.640 --> 19:24.520
We use it in our
facial treatments.

19:24.520 --> 19:28.840
We keep a supply of it
in the medicine cabinet.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.000
Do guests fill in a
medical questionnaire

19:30.000 --> 19:31.720
- when they arrive?
- Always.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.200
And who'd have access
to those records? The staff?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.880
And probably any regular guests,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.200
well, if they knew
where to look.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.480
Where'd you keep the bee venom?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.040
Over here.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.680
What's that?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.360
It's a security camera.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.840
Dr. Isherwood was worried
someone was stealing.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.120
She asked me to set it up
months ago.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.920
<i>As Matilda eyed
the hidden camera,</i>

19:57.920 --> 19:59.480
<i>she couldn't help but feel</i>

19:59.480 --> 20:02.440
<i>things were finally
coming into focus.</i>

20:19.840 --> 20:21.840
What are we looking at?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.640
Security footage from inside
the Retreat's medicine cabinet.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.120
Dr. Isherwood was the only one
qualified to book out medicine.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.680
So as well as blackmailing
Stephen Swift, Kelly,

20:30.680 --> 20:32.400
aka Yasmin Hayes,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.200
was also blackmailing
Alistair Isherwood,

20:34.200 --> 20:36.200
who in turn was getting
his sister to foot the bill.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.760
Looks like it, sir.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.760
That's not Dr. Isherwood.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.080
That's her brother Alistair.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.400
He's the one
who has been stealing.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.000
And he had reason to want
Kelly Underfield dead.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.200
Why would he want
to kill his sister?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.840
Maybe he was angry that Grace
was promoted instead of him.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
By killing Dr. Isherwood,
he inherits the Retreat

20:55.840 --> 20:58.960
and can be in charge.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.440
Put a BOLO out
for Alistair Isherwood.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.520
I want him found and
brought in for questioning.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
Sir.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.720
It's party time.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.200
Should we run after him?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.600
Nah.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.200
Going somewhere, Mr. Isherwood?

21:43.600 --> 21:47.800
Do you want to tell us
about this?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.720
It's just a sideline,

21:49.720 --> 21:52.120
a chance to earn
a bit of extra cash.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.200
Did your sister know
what you were up to?

21:54.200 --> 21:57.960
Not to start with, but yes,
eventually she found out.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.400
I can't imagine it was easy

21:59.400 --> 22:02.000
growing up
in your sister's shadow.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.600
She was so good at everything.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
And that made you jealous.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.440
No, I admired it.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.520
Despite what everyone thinks,
I'm not stupid.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.280
I know that
if it wasn't for Angela,

22:12.280 --> 22:13.760
I wouldn't have this job.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.600
I just... I wanted to have
something of my own.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.720
- Something I was good at.
- But then Yasmin found out

22:18.720 --> 22:21.000
about your illegal
face lift parties.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.880
You have to be
level six qualified

22:22.880 --> 22:25.360
to administer
the dermal fillers.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.400
And I failed the test
three times.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.480
Yasmin knew I'd be struck
off the nursing register

22:30.480 --> 22:32.160
if word got out.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.400
Please, please,
please let me just explain.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.000
She threatened to blab
unless I gave her money.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.360
Problem was I was broke.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.240
So you went to your sister.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.120
Alistair, for God's sake.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.680
I'd not seen Angela
that mad since we were kids.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.880
And she agreed to pay Yasmin
£100,000.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.960
£100,000?
Yasmin only wanted £10,000.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.760
I think you were angry
your sister was going to promote

22:52.760 --> 22:55.480
Grace Mulberry instead of you,
so you killed her.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.360
- No.
- Then you planted the false nail

22:57.360 --> 22:59.200
and the missing pass card
to make it look like

22:59.200 --> 23:01.400
- Yasmin Hayes was the killer.
- No.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.840
And when that failed,
you tainted acupuncture needles

23:03.840 --> 23:06.200
with bee venom stolen
from the medicine cabinet

23:06.200 --> 23:08.960
so that Grace Mulberry would
inadvertently poison Yasmin.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.440
I wouldn't. I couldn't.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.040
This is you stealing supplies
from the medicine cabinet.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.240
Oh, you've got it all wrong.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.920
I was stealing hyaluronic acid
for the dermal fillers.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.440
I'd never hurt Angela.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.400
I loved her.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.920
You had the means, motive, and
opportunity for both murders.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.600
- No.
- Alistair Isherwood,

23:29.600 --> 23:31.600
I'm charging you with the
murders of Dr. Angela Isherwood

23:31.600 --> 23:34.200
and Kelly Underfield,
also known as Yasmin Hayes.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.280
No, please.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.840
I didn't do it.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.280
I'm having dinner with
Beth and Cat later.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.720
You're welcome to join us
if you'd like?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.360
Mattie?

23:48.360 --> 23:51.080
Sorry, no, I'm fine, thanks.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.600
I promised the inspector
I'd have all the paperwork

23:52.600 --> 23:54.120
done by morning.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.000
Do you really think
Alistair is guilty?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.960
Inspector Thorne says
it's the court's job

23:58.960 --> 24:00.320
to decide guilt or innocent,

24:00.320 --> 24:02.760
ours is to gather
and present the evidence.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.480
Sounds like you think
the killer is still out there.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.600
Everything points to Alistair
being the murderer.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.400
My head tells me
it's him, but...

24:12.400 --> 24:14.200
Your heart tells you
something different.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.400
<i>It was at that precise moment</i>

24:16.400 --> 24:19.360
<i>that Matilda thought
she might be onto something.</i>

24:19.360 --> 24:21.680
My heart tells me
something different.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.200
Mattie?

24:30.200 --> 24:33.280
<i>And a heartbeat later
when she knew she was.</i>

24:33.280 --> 24:35.440
They match.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.480
The dates, they all match.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.120
- Where are you going?
- The station.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.240
Do we have to go to this
keep fit class?

24:47.240 --> 24:48.720
It will be good for us.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.960
Oh, it's Jane.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.120
Hello.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.680
- Matilda's onto something.
- Did she say what?

24:56.680 --> 24:58.280
No, just something about
the dates matching,

24:58.280 --> 24:59.760
and then she was off.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.600
Attention,

25:01.600 --> 25:04.200
the healthy heart workout
begins in two minutes

25:04.200 --> 25:06.520
in the dance studio.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.000
What is that noise?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.600
It's just the intercom
announcing the start

25:09.600 --> 25:12.960
of our healthy heart workout.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.680
Healthy heart workout?

25:15.680 --> 25:18.440
Oh, I need one of you to come
with me to Dr. Lynch's practice.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.200
Oh, yeah, me, me, I'll go.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.360
It looks like
you've got a reprieve.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.440
- Yeah.
- Bye.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.440
Bye.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.200
Oh, am I too late
for an appointment?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.240
I was heading home.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.800
It won't take long.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.080
I'll wait here.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.600
Take a seat.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.520
What seems to be the problem?

25:45.520 --> 25:49.680
Well, I've been having
these dizzy spells

25:49.680 --> 25:51.840
and I almost fainted
last week.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.560
Did you hear that?

26:17.560 --> 26:19.120
No.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.000
Oh, oh, my head's spinning.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.040
I think I'm having another one
of my turns.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.000
Oh, you know what?
I'm feeling much better.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.200
Thanks, doc.
You're a miracle worker.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.360
I haven't done anything.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.640
It must be the placebo effect.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.640
Thank you.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.240
<i>Despite a desire to believe
the best of people,</i>

26:46.240 --> 26:49.720
<i>Dr. Daniel Lynch couldn't help
but feel his affections</i>

26:49.720 --> 26:52.240
<i>for all things
related to Matilda</i>

26:52.240 --> 26:55.280
<i>had ironically been
taken advantage of</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:58.960
<i>by those directly
related to her.</i>

27:01.640 --> 27:05.200
<i>Affections he now felt
compelled to act upon.</i>

27:25.440 --> 27:28.120
Hello?

27:28.200 --> 27:29.920
Hello?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.040
Hello?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.040
Anybody there?

27:57.680 --> 27:59.040
Where's Grace?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.480
She was in the maintenance room.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.680
Show me.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.200
It's this way.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.440
Why would she switch off
the state room's fire alarm?

28:18.440 --> 28:20.240
Call the fire brigade.
Get everybody out.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.840
Where are you going?

28:21.840 --> 28:23.360
To stop Grace Mulberry
from burning this place

28:23.360 --> 28:24.880
to the ground.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.080
I'm sorry, Beth.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.040
I couldn't let you
get in the way of my plans.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.360
By the time these chlorine
tablets react with the alcohol

28:51.360 --> 28:56.400
and start the fire,
I'll be long gone.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.760
Why do you want to
burn the place down?

29:00.760 --> 29:02.840
Why would I want to burn down
the Retreat?

29:02.840 --> 29:06.200
Because it was built
with blood money.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.880
Stay back.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.200
One step closer,
we all go up in flames.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.000
Everyone gather
on the flagstones.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.680
Have you seen Matilda?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.520
She's gone to the state room.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.480
Kelly Underfield wasn't
only blackmailing

29:19.480 --> 29:22.240
Stephen Swift and Alistair,

29:22.240 --> 29:25.080
she was also blackmailing
Dr. Isherwood.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.640
You and your parents weren't
the only people

29:26.640 --> 29:30.200
in that car accident.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.440
You had a younger brother,
Miles,

29:33.440 --> 29:35.280
who like you ended up in a coma

29:35.280 --> 29:38.960
in Dr. Isherwood's
intensive care unit.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.080
Kelly was six at the time.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.640
She had a genetic
heart condition

29:43.640 --> 29:47.600
and she had been waiting years
for a heart transplant.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.400
With Kelly days from death,

29:49.400 --> 29:52.200
her father heard
about your story,

29:52.200 --> 29:54.440
and I'm betting he bribed
Dr. Isherwood

29:54.440 --> 29:57.280
to give Kelly Miles's heart.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.920
Tell me I'm wrong.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.600
Dr. Isherwood made it look like
Miles wasn't gonna pull through.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.920
She switched off
his life support

30:06.920 --> 30:11.560
so that his heart could be used
to save Kelly's life.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.920
And Dr. Isherwood used
Paul Underfield's bribe

30:13.920 --> 30:15.680
to set up the Wellness Retreat.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.760
Natasha.
- Daniel, what're you doing here?

30:19.760 --> 30:21.360
- Where's Matilda?
- Oh.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.920
Please. It's important.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.720
I think she's in the state room.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.720
Daniel? Daniel?!

30:26.720 --> 30:31.240
When did you realize
Kelly had your brother's heart?

30:31.240 --> 30:34.960
Not long after I saw
her heart transplant scar.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.840
Therapists are like
hairdressers.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.440
Customers like to tell you
their life story.

30:40.440 --> 30:44.080
She kept going on about
how ill she'd been as a child.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.280
How she had this big
heart transplant operation,

30:47.280 --> 30:50.200
but she didn't stop there.

30:50.200 --> 30:55.600
She bragged about how
before her father died,

30:55.600 --> 31:02.000
he passed on his big secret
about he saved her life.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.360
He boasted about paying
an intensive care doctor

31:05.360 --> 31:07.200
half a million to switch off

31:07.200 --> 31:09.840
some dying kid's
life support early

31:09.840 --> 31:12.520
so that Kelly
could have his heart.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.960
It was like she was proud of it.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.400
And you knew that doctor
was Angela Isherwood.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.520
The dates of Miles's death
and Kelly's operation

31:21.520 --> 31:24.240
were too close for it
to be a coincidence.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.600
It had to be her.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.200
So you planned your revenge.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.720
Wouldn't you?

31:29.720 --> 31:32.200
If you found out
someone you trusted

31:32.200 --> 31:34.920
had been lying to you
your whole life.

31:34.920 --> 31:38.200
Everything Dr. Isherwood
did for me,

31:38.200 --> 31:41.840
it was born out of guilt
for killing my brother.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.880
But why frame Kelly
for Dr. Isherwood's murder?

31:45.880 --> 31:49.040
Miles was...

31:49.040 --> 31:50.800
pure,

31:50.800 --> 31:52.600
honest,

31:52.600 --> 31:55.600
too good for this world.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.520
Kelly didn't deserve his heart.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.400
She was rotten to the core.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.840
Which is why when my aunts
uncovered an alibi for Kelly,

32:01.840 --> 32:03.360
you decided to kill her as well.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.280
Matilda!

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
Say goodbye to your aunt,
Sergeant.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.400
Grace had been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.720
Feeding us suspects while

32:42.720 --> 32:46.400
deflecting suspicion
from herself.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.640
When Lord Overshaw supplied
an alibi for Yasmin,

32:48.640 --> 32:50.960
AKA Kelly Underfield,

32:50.960 --> 32:52.840
Grace decided to kill her
as well

32:52.840 --> 32:55.200
and set Alistair up
for both murders.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.920
But why Alistair?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.840
Dr. Isherwood promoting Grace

32:58.840 --> 33:00.680
instead of Alistair
gave him motive

33:00.680 --> 33:03.720
plus Grace was the one who
set up the security camera

33:03.720 --> 33:05.600
in the medicine cabinet.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.600
When she saw footage of Alistair
stealing the hyaluronic acid,

33:08.600 --> 33:10.720
she knew she could use it
to make us believe

33:10.720 --> 33:14.360
he was the one
who stole the bee venom.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.720
With everything in place,

33:15.720 --> 33:17.640
Grace killed Kelly Underfield

33:17.640 --> 33:19.200
and made it look like
she'd been duped

33:19.200 --> 33:21.280
into administering
the fatal poison.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
And Dr. Isherwood went through
with the charade

33:26.000 --> 33:28.080
that she won all the money
in a poker game --

33:28.080 --> 33:29.360
Because she knew
it would be impossible

33:29.360 --> 33:31.560
to hide a £500,000 bribe.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.200
Money won in licensed
gambling premises in the UK

33:34.200 --> 33:37.080
is tax free and totally legit.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.240
It was the perfect way
for her to launder the money

33:39.240 --> 33:40.920
without drawing suspicion,

33:40.920 --> 33:43.200
especially as no one knew
who she won the money from.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.560
Until Cat uncovered the truth.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.400
Dr. Isherwood thought
it was all in the past,

33:47.400 --> 33:48.960
but it all came back
to haunt her

33:48.960 --> 33:50.880
when Kelly Underfield
booked into the Retreat

33:50.880 --> 33:55.200
under a false name
and started blackmailing her.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.000
Well done on getting your man,
Stone.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.760
I mean woman.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.760
Thank you, sir.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.720
I'll expect a full report
on my desk by the morning.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.600
Sir.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.040
Ladies.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

34:12.880 --> 34:14.520
Yes!

34:31.360 --> 34:33.200
Oh, do hurry up, Mummy.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.280
Oh, you'll be fine.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.000
I don't know why
I've put on weight

34:39.000 --> 34:41.400
since I've been here, sweet pea.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.200
Must be my metabolism.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.640
Beth, do you have a moment?

34:45.640 --> 34:47.040
See you in a sec.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.520
Thank you for everything
you've done.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.440
I'd still be under arrest
if it weren't for you.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.240
There's still the matter
of the face lift parties.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.600
I've decided to take
early retirement,

35:02.600 --> 35:04.120
and I've written
to the Nursing Board

35:04.120 --> 35:05.480
this morning
to let them know.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.560
And what about this place?

35:07.560 --> 35:10.600
It's mine in name, but I'm going
to leave the day-to-day

35:10.600 --> 35:12.720
running to our new
Retreat Director.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.680
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.880
The Retreat's reputation
has taken a serious blow,

35:17.880 --> 35:20.360
but I'm determined
to turn that around.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.760
Thanks again for everything.

35:23.760 --> 35:27.880
Did you ever tell Alistair
how you feel about him?

35:27.880 --> 35:29.600
Decided against it.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.200
After recent events,
I've started thinking

35:31.200 --> 35:32.920
that the idea of love
at first sight

35:32.920 --> 35:35.200
is a load of old nonsense.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.360
It's time I moved on
with my life.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.680
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Sergeant,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.320
I have a Wellness Retreat
to run.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.400
What did loverboy want?

35:48.400 --> 35:49.600
Dinner.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.480
He asked you out?

35:51.480 --> 35:54.840
Well, there's no need
to look quite so surprised.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.280
He figured I'd already
seen him naked,

35:56.280 --> 35:57.760
so what's the worst
that could happen?

35:57.760 --> 36:00.320
Well, I hope you said no.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.880
I said I'd think about it.

36:02.880 --> 36:07.600
Well, I'll ring him later
and let him down gently.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.400
Very sensible.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.960
I just don't think
he's your type, that's all.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.640
<i>Although looking forward
to her date with George,</i>

36:18.640 --> 36:22.360
<i>Matilda knew she wouldn't
be able to enjoy the evening</i>

36:22.360 --> 36:24.600
<i>until she had first
investigated</i>

36:24.600 --> 36:29.200
<i>the marital history of
a certain person of interest,</i>

36:29.200 --> 36:32.880
<i>the resident of 33 Brick Lane.</i>

36:49.640 --> 36:52.200
Edith Bryant?
Sorry to bother you.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.440
I'm Matilda Stone.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.680
Yes?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.880
I was wondering,

36:56.880 --> 37:00.040
was your husband
Chief Inspector Bryant?

37:00.040 --> 37:02.880
I think you must be mistaken.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.400
I've never been married.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.960
I'm sorry. I have to go.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.680
<i>And while Matilda considered</i>

37:12.680 --> 37:16.400
<i>ringing Edith Bryant's doorbell
for a second time,</i>

37:16.400 --> 37:18.400
<i>her Aunt Beth was considering</i>

37:18.400 --> 37:21.520
<i>a ring of
a very different kind.</i>

37:36.080 --> 37:39.720
Hi, Stephen.
It's Beth Stone.

37:39.720 --> 37:40.960
Look, I'm sorry.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.280
I'm afraid I can't make dinner.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.400
No.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.200
But I wouldn't say no
to a drink sometime.

37:52.640 --> 37:56.120
Matilda, sorry.
I mucked up.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.400
There's a private party tonight.
They can't give us a table.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.880
No, no, no,
the sign's all wrong.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.440
It needs to be higher.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.640
I specifically told you
not to invite

38:08.640 --> 38:10.040
any of your work colleagues.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.880
I mean, I ask you to do one...

38:13.880 --> 38:16.400
<i>Seeing Daniel, Matilda wondered</i>

38:16.400 --> 38:19.480
<i>if the notion of love
at first sight was,</i>

38:19.480 --> 38:22.400
<i>as Rowena Walker
so eloquently put it,</i>

38:22.400 --> 38:25.600
<i>a load of old nonsense
and whether, like Rowena,</i>

38:25.600 --> 38:28.840
<i>it was time she too moved on.</i>

38:28.840 --> 38:30.760
Don't worry about it.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.200
Let's eat at the Crepe Gatsby
tonight instead.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.520
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.080
Come on.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.200
Goodbye, Daniel.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.680
Yes, that's right.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.000
Matilda, quick question.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.400
Do you always walk that slowly?

38:50.400 --> 38:52.600
Sorry.
Oh, your shoe lace is undone.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.880
Last one to the restaurant
pays for dinner.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.680
Hang on, that's not fair.
Matilda!

38:59.680 --> 39:02.920
<i>Despite attempts to move on
with their lives,</i>

39:02.920 --> 39:04.680
<i>the recent return of Matilda</i>

39:04.680 --> 39:07.280
<i>has forced certain
local residents</i>

39:07.280 --> 39:10.520
<i>to relive what we shall call</i>

39:10.520 --> 39:14.880
<i>less virtuous aspects
of their past.</i>

39:14.880 --> 39:16.840
I panicked.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.080
<i>Aspects of their past
they hoped</i>

39:19.080 --> 39:22.600
<i>had long since been buried.</i>

39:22.600 --> 39:25.440
I didn't know what else to say.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.760
What am I gonna do
when she finds out the truth?

39:29.920 --> 39:32.480
Hello?

39:32.560 --> 39:34.200
Hello?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.760
Are you still there?
