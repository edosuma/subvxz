Terrible, I think
he has amnesia!

Well, memory loss
is a tricky thing.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.120

Okay, he's-- he's

Josh:
Elliot!

01:00.080 --> 01:02.040
Josh!

01:02.040 --> 01:03.170
You remember me!

01:03.170 --> 01:05.330
Of course I do, buddy.
Bring it in!

01:05.330 --> 01:07.120
Oh my god, how does he remember

01:07.120 --> 01:08.380
everyone except for me?

01:09.380 --> 01:11.250
Josh? Hey...

01:11.250 --> 01:12.250
Do you remember

01:12.250 --> 01:13.420
when we were sitting
on your couch, and--

01:13.420 --> 01:15.120
-No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...
-But--

01:15.120 --> 01:16.380
You have to allow Josh
to remember everything

01:16.380 --> 01:17.460
on his own.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.460
Otherwise, it can cause
a psychic meltdown!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.170
I never miss an episode
of General Hospital.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.000
Um, Doctor, listen,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.420
I-- I don't think
you understand,

01:28.420 --> 01:30.250
I said something
kind of major to him

01:30.250 --> 01:31.960
right before he got knocked out,

01:31.960 --> 01:33.420
and I really need to know
what he was gonna say back.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.170
I understand your frustration,

01:35.170 --> 01:37.250
but pushin' Josh can cause him
such emotional distress,

01:37.250 --> 01:39.000
that he could block out
even more.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, but god! How do you even
know that for sure?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.080
I mean, wh-- wh-- where'd you
even go to medical school?

01:43.080 --> 01:44.080
Harvard.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.420
Wow, that's-- that's really
good, good for you.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.250
Hey, guys...

01:50.250 --> 01:52.170
I think I'm starting
to remember something.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.330
Hey, everybody. I'm home.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.250
Josh, you look fantastic.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.460
Who travels 10 hours
and looks this good?

02:02.460 --> 02:04.120
Ha-ha, you!

02:05.460 --> 02:07.000
How was your trip?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.170
Aw, China was awesome!

02:09.170 --> 02:10.380
Only problem is,

02:10.380 --> 02:11.420
you open a business there,

02:11.420 --> 02:13.380
an hour later you wanna
open another one! (laughs)

02:13.380 --> 02:15.250
(both laughing)

02:15.250 --> 02:17.080
(Elliot laughing)

02:17.080 --> 02:18.290
Elliot, who's this?

02:19.460 --> 02:22.120
Uh, hopefully your new chef...
if I'm lucky!

02:23.250 --> 02:24.420
Oh my god, I remember you.

02:24.420 --> 02:26.040
You do?

02:26.040 --> 02:29.170
Yeah, I remember
everything exactly.

02:29.170 --> 02:32.000
You were at my penthouse.
I was sitting on the couch.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.420
-Mm-hm.
-And I was just about
to interview you to be my chef.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.420
What?

02:36.420 --> 02:38.120
Yeah.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.040
You were gonna
make me an audition meal.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.290
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Can ya fast forward a little?

02:43.290 --> 02:45.290
And you never got the chance,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.460
I-- I guess,
because of all this.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.330
I'll tell you what.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.380
As soon as I get discharged,
how about you come over

02:52.380 --> 02:54.000
and cook me that audition meal?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.080
(laughs) Awesome!

02:57.080 --> 02:59.080
Audition meal?

02:59.080 --> 03:01.330
Do you believe this?
I have to try out
for the same job

03:01.330 --> 03:03.210
I've had for two years!

03:03.210 --> 03:07.460
I don't understand.
Why can't you just tell Josh
who you are and what happened?

03:07.460 --> 03:10.290
Because this stupid
smart Harvard doctor
won't let me!

03:12.040 --> 03:14.000
He said Josh has to remember
everything by himself

03:14.000 --> 03:15.170
or it could
cause a psychic meltdown.

03:15.170 --> 03:18.040
It's basic brain stuff,
Sofia, basic brain stuff.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.040
Okay, okay, so you'll
make your audition meal,

03:21.040 --> 03:23.040
he'll hire you
and eventually he'll...
get his memory back.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.080
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
I mean, five hours ago

03:25.080 --> 03:26.330
I was telling Josh
that I loved him.

03:26.330 --> 03:29.040
I mean, what if he never
remembers what he was gonna
say back?

03:29.040 --> 03:32.210
-He'll remember.
-But how do you know?

03:32.210 --> 03:34.330
Because, Gabi, people
remember feelings.

03:34.330 --> 03:37.120
If anything, you should be happy
that he wants you to make
this audition meal.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.120
Okay? If you ask me,
that's the first moment
he had feelings for you.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.380
Grilled cheese?

03:47.250 --> 03:50.420
This... looks... fantastic.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.170
Mmm.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.460
It's so ooey-gooey.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.080
You know what?

03:59.080 --> 04:00.420
Forget the other guy.
You're hired.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.040
-Wha?
-Whoa!

04:04.080 --> 04:06.380
Oh my god!
You're right, Sofia.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.170
All I have to do
is make the same meal
and the same things will happen,

04:09.170 --> 04:12.120
and then, Josh and I
will be together, and then
not together, and then together,

04:12.120 --> 04:15.000
and-- and then not together,
and then together and then
not together.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.420
Yeah. It'll be so fun
to relive it all again.

04:18.420 --> 04:21.290
Oh my god, I can do this,
I have done this.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.290
I'm gonna look for the dress
I wore the first day.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.080
Oh, and don't forget
a dress for the wedding.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.000
Sofia, my grilled cheese
isn't that good.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.330
Your Uncle Chris
is getting married
in Aspen.

04:30.330 --> 04:33.380
-What?
-Yeah, his invitation got mixed
into the pile of bills

04:33.380 --> 04:35.250
we use to even out
our table legs.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.290
Oh my god, he's getting married
in Aspen this weekend,

04:40.290 --> 04:42.210
and he sent me
two train tickets.
-Yeah. Oh.

04:42.210 --> 04:47.210
I'm not saying he copied me,
but everyone knows that Aspen
is my dream wedding location.

04:47.210 --> 04:50.250
Oh my god... Aspen.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.040
Oh, I swear to god,
if the bride's dad
skis her down the aisle...

04:54.040 --> 04:57.000
(sighs)
Can you think
of a more romantic place

04:57.000 --> 04:58.380
to celebrate your love?

04:58.380 --> 05:00.170
Oh, you're right.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.420
I'm so happy for your uncle.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.170
No no, I'm talkin'
about me and Josh.

05:04.290 --> 05:06.380
Come on!
Him telling me he loves me

05:06.380 --> 05:08.210
on a snow-covered mountain?

05:08.210 --> 05:10.210
Okay, now you're stealing
my wedding ideas?

05:10.210 --> 05:14.080
It is so much more romantic
than telling me he loves me
on a stupid couch!

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
Oh my god!
Amnesia rules!

05:21.250 --> 05:24.380
-Hey, Elliot--
-One moment, I'm just
finishing up an interview.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.170
With who?

05:26.170 --> 05:27.380
(gasps)

05:29.080 --> 05:30.330
Michael Voltaggio?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.380
What is Top Chef
Michael Voltaggio doing here?

05:32.380 --> 05:35.380
Hi. Very good to see you again,
remember we met here last time?

05:35.380 --> 05:37.000
No.

05:38.210 --> 05:40.460
Does anyone remember me?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.080
No. Isn't it great?

05:45.420 --> 05:48.420
Elliot, what is he doing here?
I thought this was a redo
for me!

05:48.420 --> 05:50.420
Well, it's also a redo for me.

05:50.420 --> 05:54.000
This time I want Josh
to choose the right chef.

05:55.170 --> 05:58.040
Listen, I wish I could stay
to meet with Josh...

05:58.040 --> 06:00.380
You can!
He'll be up any minute.

06:00.380 --> 06:05.080
But due to a recent head injury,
we're not supposed to wake--
(yelling) Josh!

06:05.080 --> 06:08.460
But it'll totally be worth it
if you stay and meet--
(yelling) Josh!

06:10.250 --> 06:12.290
I'm sorry, I really gotta go.

06:12.290 --> 06:15.290
I left some apps
for Josh to taste, or...

06:15.290 --> 06:17.170
you guys can come
to one of my restaurants.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.920
Wh-- Why do you even
need this job?

06:21.210 --> 06:23.420
Elliot, I can't believe
you would be so evil.

06:23.420 --> 06:26.000
Really? It's
kind of my brand.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.170
Morning, boss.
How are you feelin'?

06:29.170 --> 06:31.420
Mmm, better. Little better.

06:31.420 --> 06:35.000
Hey... Gabi. Right?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.420
-Yeah.
-See, I know you.
You're here for the interview.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.080
Uh-huh. Yeah.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.420
And I know exactly
what you want to eat,

06:40.420 --> 06:43.120
because I am a food mind reader.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.330
It's one of my super powers.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.250
Oh, yeah?
What am I cravin'?

06:48.250 --> 06:49.290
A man.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.250
She's good.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.460
Here ya go.
It's my famous
grilled cheese.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.290
I think you'll like it.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.420
This... looks... fantastic!

07:08.080 --> 07:10.330
Mm... doesn't taste fantastic.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.170
What? No, but-- but you
loved my grilled cheese.
You said it was so ooey-gooey!

07:16.170 --> 07:19.040
What are you talking about?
You've never cooked for me.
Yolanda, what's going on?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.420
Uh, nothin' baby,
nothin' at all.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.080
Gabi!

07:24.250 --> 07:26.170
Girl, what is wrong with you?

07:26.170 --> 07:28.170
Do you want Josh
to have a psychic meltdown?

07:28.170 --> 07:31.080
I don't understand,
he loved my grilled cheese.
Why did he hate it?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.210
Oh, his taste buds
are all messed up.

07:33.210 --> 07:36.000
Hayden used to love coffee,
but after her concussion,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.040
just the smell of it
made her sick.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.420
Who's Hayden?

07:40.420 --> 07:43.210
(sighs) From General Hospital !

07:45.420 --> 07:49.080
The point is,
Hayden got her memory back
and so will Josh.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.210
Oh my god,
this is delicious.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.250
(gasps)

07:51.250 --> 07:52.330
That was fast.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.460
Who made this?

07:53.460 --> 07:55.250
Michael Voltaggio!

07:56.380 --> 07:58.290
I'm sorry, Gabi,
but Voltaggio's hired.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.040
-No!
-Yes!

08:01.040 --> 08:02.420
Call hot chef!

08:08.330 --> 08:10.040
(screams)

08:11.040 --> 08:12.460
What the hell
are you doing?

08:12.460 --> 08:15.040
Waiting to find out
if Josh remembered anything!

08:15.040 --> 08:17.380
Did he say anything about me?
Did he show any signs
of remembering me,

08:17.380 --> 08:19.460
are his taste buds back,
what are you hiding?

08:19.460 --> 08:21.330
why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

08:21.330 --> 08:23.330
'Cause of this!

08:25.210 --> 08:28.380
I'm sorry, it's just,
what if Josh never
remembers me,

08:28.380 --> 08:31.330
what if-- what if
he likes Top Chef
Michael Voltaggio so much

08:31.330 --> 08:35.000
that he keeps him on
as his chef, and I never have
a reason to go back to Josh's

08:35.000 --> 08:37.330
and he forgets me forever?

08:37.330 --> 08:41.080
Um... uh-- Uh, Gabi,
uh... it's 9 a.m.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.290
I know!

08:44.330 --> 08:48.330
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I hate seein' you
like this.

08:48.330 --> 08:49.460
Then help me.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.080
Okay, uh, name it,
how, I'll do anything.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.040
Okay, the train to Aspen
leaves tomorrow night.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.330
Can you help me
jog Josh's memory?

08:55.330 --> 08:57.330
Nope.

08:57.330 --> 09:00.210
But you just said
that you'd help me.

09:00.210 --> 09:03.170
Okay, first of all,
the girls and I,
don't jog.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.250
More importantly,
you heard that doctor.

09:08.250 --> 09:12.080
He said we can't start
messin' with Josh's mind
by sayin' anything!

09:12.080 --> 09:14.000
I know, I know,
but what if we don't
say anything,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
but we show him!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.080
Oh my damn,
Josh's childhood blanket

09:18.080 --> 09:21.080
that he lost in a fire
and you recreated
for his birthday!

09:21.080 --> 09:23.420
Yeah! We show him this
and he'll remember everything!

09:23.420 --> 09:25.040
You're right!

09:25.040 --> 09:26.420
And he'll never forget that!

09:26.420 --> 09:28.080
Yeah, so you'll help me?

09:28.080 --> 09:30.460
You would think
after all that, (laughs)
but nope.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.000
(cries)

09:45.210 --> 09:49.040
(sing-songy)
Michael V,
it's Elliot P!

09:50.170 --> 09:53.000
You remember Yolanda.
She's the housekeeper.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.290
Of course, the only thing
she's ever waxed
is her mustache.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.250
Hey, that's rude.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.120
(laughs)
Right?

10:02.120 --> 10:05.290
So MV, we have an issue
to deal with today.

10:05.290 --> 10:08.170
What? You finally moved
into a C cup? (laughs)

10:10.420 --> 10:12.290
Your turn, Michael!

10:13.420 --> 10:15.120
My turn for what?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.000
To roast Elliot.
Anything you want.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.250
Fat, short, sweaty,
let him have it.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.250
I think that's really childish.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.250
Isn't she?

10:23.250 --> 10:28.210
Anyway, last night Alan and I
got in a big fight, and I need
you guys to help me fix it.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.250
Okay, let's hear the plan.

10:29.250 --> 10:33.210
-What plan?
-Well, first off, Michael,
I need you to dress up

10:33.210 --> 10:38.000
as Alan's long lost
grandma and take my side
in an argument, then--

10:38.000 --> 10:40.170
What? Why would I do that?

10:40.170 --> 10:42.120
That's what we do around here.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.250
Well, I don't.

10:47.250 --> 10:50.420
Oh. Well, can you at least

10:50.420 --> 10:53.000
bake me an "I'm sorry" cake
to bring home?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.210
I would, but I'm too busy
making this "I don't work
for you" lunch.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.330
Oh.

10:59.330 --> 11:03.170
(laughing)
Ooh-hoo! You got him good!

11:05.330 --> 11:07.210
You two are a piece of work.

11:07.210 --> 11:10.000
And speaking of work,
do you guys do any
around here?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.080
Say what?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.420
Ohh... and when's the last time
you cleaned out this fridge?

11:14.420 --> 11:16.290
And I'm not talking about food.

11:16.290 --> 11:21.420
(laughing)
'Scuse me for a minute.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.420
Gabi?
Put down that wine
and pick up that blanket.

11:32.170 --> 11:34.330
(in a loud voice)
Thank you for comin'
and helpin' me

11:34.330 --> 11:36.000
with my computer, Josh.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.170
Yolanda:
Where are my keys?

11:39.170 --> 11:42.330
Well, you know what?
Good thing my neighbor
keeps a spare,

11:42.330 --> 11:44.330
and she always
leaves her door open.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.170
Whoa...

11:52.170 --> 11:54.250
Whoa, what?

11:54.250 --> 11:57.420
I'm gettin' this really
weird feeling.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.330
This place seems familiar
to me.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.080
Hell, yeah, it does.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.170
What is it about this place?

12:04.170 --> 12:09.000
I don't know, but, um,
maybe my keys are in the bed--
uh, we should try the bed.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.040
Let's try the bed!

12:10.040 --> 12:11.080
Why would keys
be in the bed?

12:11.080 --> 12:12.290
Just look in the bed.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.330
Am I in love with the girl
that lives in this apartment?

12:22.330 --> 12:24.080
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

12:24.080 --> 12:27.080
-What?
-Uh! Uh, uh, just--
um, um, out of--

12:27.080 --> 12:30.290
Hoo, out of breath
from walkin' from there
to here, it's just... (exhales)

12:30.290 --> 12:32.120
I'm starting to remember.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.250
Oh my god, Josh!
What are you doing here?

12:36.250 --> 12:37.330
Did you get your memory back?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.210
Yeah, I think I did.

12:44.290 --> 12:47.080
Wh-- Wh-- (screams)

12:49.080 --> 12:51.000
You're the girl
that knows my heart.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.120
(laughs)

12:52.120 --> 12:54.000
-Ahh! What do I do?
-(Josh laughing)

12:54.000 --> 12:56.250
What do I do?
What do I do?

12:56.250 --> 12:59.170
Tell me everything!
Where did we meet?
How did we meet?

12:59.170 --> 13:01.250
Do you feel the same way
I do? How do you feel?

13:01.250 --> 13:03.290
-Uh, dizzy.
-(Yolanda stutters)

13:03.290 --> 13:08.040
She can't tell you
how she feels, she's not allowed
to answer, doctor's orders.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.120
W-- I wanna know everything,
tell me everything.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.120
-Uh...
-Do you wanna have
a psychic meltdown? Huh?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.380
I'm not gonna be responsible
for that, get your ass up.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.210
Wait...

13:18.210 --> 13:20.330
will you at least
have dinner with me tonight?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.380
-Uhhh...
-I heard a yes, let's go.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.170
Oh my god, this is so exciting,
I can't believe I'm having
dinner with-- Wait,

13:25.170 --> 13:26.250
what's your name?

13:26.250 --> 13:28.420
(crying)
What just happened?

13:28.420 --> 13:33.290
Hey! Hey! Oh, my god!

13:33.290 --> 13:34.330
Where's Josh?
Where'd he go?

13:34.330 --> 13:36.250
Gabi, why are you coming out
the window, what's going on?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.380
Why do you have
arugula in your hair?

13:39.170 --> 13:41.170
Well, I-- I was spying
on Josh from the fire escape,

13:41.170 --> 13:45.000
and, when I saw him kiss you,
I was so shocked I stumbled back
and I fell into the dumpster,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.080
now, where did he go?

13:46.080 --> 13:47.380
Well, Yolanda took him home.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.330
Oh, well, what did he say
when-- when you told him

13:49.330 --> 13:51.080
that I'm the one
that made the blanket,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.080
and I'm the one
that knows his heart?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.210
I didn't tell him.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.250
What? Why?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.250
Because you said
I wasn't allowed to say
any of that!

13:58.250 --> 14:00.420
Everyone's tellin' me
I'm not allowed to say
any of that!

14:00.420 --> 14:02.000
You didn't say anything?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.210
No! Well, he did invite me
to dinner tonight, but...

14:11.170 --> 14:13.080
What?
You are having dinner

14:13.080 --> 14:14.250
with the man who forgot
he loves me?

14:14.250 --> 14:16.120
Gabi, it was the only way
he would leave.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.330
Ohhh, was it, Sofia?

14:18.420 --> 14:21.120
-Yeah, it was.
-Was it really, Sofia?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.120
Mm-hm.
What are you saying?

14:23.120 --> 14:25.210
Well, how long did you let him
kiss you before you pulled away?

14:25.210 --> 14:26.250
Oh my-- What?

14:26.250 --> 14:29.120
-Did you like the kiss?
-Okay, you are really losing--

14:29.120 --> 14:32.380
Did! You! Like it!

14:32.380 --> 14:36.250
No! He's Josh, okay?
He's gross-- I mean,
not gross for you,

14:36.250 --> 14:38.330
but gross for me, okay?
I have no feelings for him!

14:38.330 --> 14:42.000
Well, I do, okay?
I-- I can't take this
anymore, all right?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.380
I'm-- I'm going over there
right now, and I am telling him
exactly who I am,

14:45.380 --> 14:47.040
and what we mean
to each other!

14:47.040 --> 14:48.380
-But what about--
-The psychic meltdown!

14:48.380 --> 14:50.000
I'm having one!

14:57.380 --> 14:59.210
Josh? We need to talk.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.460
Whoa, whoa, how the hell
did you get in here?

15:01.460 --> 15:04.170
Because you made me a key,
because I work here.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.330
No, I gave the job
to the other guy.

15:06.330 --> 15:08.420
Not the first time,
the first time you gave
the job to me.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.250
What first time?
What are you talking about?

15:10.250 --> 15:11.330
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.210
I know--
I know you had
a traumatic brain injury,

15:13.210 --> 15:14.420
and I'm not supposed
to say anything to you,

15:14.420 --> 15:16.120
but I really need
to say something to you,

15:16.120 --> 15:17.250
because I really
need you to remember!

15:17.250 --> 15:18.380
All I remember
is I interviewed you,

15:18.380 --> 15:20.210
and I didn't like
your grilled cheese.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.330
Ugghh! See, that's the thing!

15:23.330 --> 15:26.330
That's the thing!
Two years ago,
you interviewed me,

15:26.330 --> 15:30.000
and you loved my grilled cheese,
and you hired me to be
your chef.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.080
And then we got drunk
and we slept together,

15:32.080 --> 15:34.330
and-- which I don't expect you
to remember because I barely
remember it,

15:34.330 --> 15:37.080
but, we both regretted it
because you were engaged,

15:37.080 --> 15:39.250
but then you broke off
your engagement
to be with me!

15:39.250 --> 15:41.290
And then, we tried
to be together, but we
couldn't be together,

15:41.290 --> 15:43.420
because we argued
a lot, because we're both
very passionate people,

15:43.420 --> 15:45.170
but... then we came up
with this idea

15:45.170 --> 15:47.420
of the punch card relationship,
so we could have sex
without the feelings,

15:47.420 --> 15:49.460
but then, I did have feelings,
and I told you that I loved you,

15:49.460 --> 15:51.210
and you were about to tell me
if you loved me,

15:51.210 --> 15:54.170
but then the goddamn squirrel
jumped out, and it made you
hit your head

15:54.170 --> 15:56.290
and forget everything,
including the fact
that I'm the one

15:56.290 --> 15:58.170
that made you
that blanket that you found,

15:58.170 --> 16:01.330
because I'm the one
that knows your heart.
Now, you have to believe me!

16:02.330 --> 16:05.460
Gabi... I believe you.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.120
You do?

16:07.120 --> 16:10.080
Yes. I don't think anybody
can make that up.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.210
Ohh...

16:11.210 --> 16:13.000
Oh, thank god.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.120
But I don't remember it.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.460
What?

16:18.460 --> 16:22.170
I remember Elliot and Yolanda,
and I remember my family,

16:22.170 --> 16:23.330
and all the feelings
I had for them.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.290
And I'm not sure
how to say this, but...

16:28.460 --> 16:30.420
I think if I loved you...

16:30.420 --> 16:33.080
I'd remember it.

16:40.170 --> 16:43.080
(Gabi crying)

16:43.080 --> 16:46.000
(speaking incoherently)

16:47.670 --> 16:49.960
I know, I know.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.040
Actually, I don't know.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.080
Could you speak
a little clearer?

16:53.620 --> 16:55.750
-Can you do me a favor?
-Anything.

16:55.750 --> 16:59.040
Can you hit me over the head
so I get amnesia so I can forget

16:59.040 --> 17:03.710
what Josh just told me,
'cause it was so hurtful!

17:03.710 --> 17:05.710
Oh, Gabi,
it's gonna be okay.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.750
How? How's it gonna
be okay?

17:07.750 --> 17:11.750
I mean, we have
two options here.
One, he doesn't remember me

17:11.750 --> 17:14.080
and it's over,
or two, he will remember me,

17:14.080 --> 17:18.790
including that night
on the couch where he was gonna
tell me that he didn't love me.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.670
Or three, and don't forget
about three, he remembers you,

17:21.670 --> 17:23.670
and was gonna tell you
he does love you.

17:23.670 --> 17:27.960
No, he doesn't love me,
he says that it's over!

17:27.960 --> 17:29.830
Are we in Aspen yet?

17:29.830 --> 17:31.670
No, we haven't left yet.

17:31.670 --> 17:35.790
What? I'm gonna be crying
for another 28 hours
and 55 minutes?

17:35.790 --> 17:37.830
Oh! Not necessarily...

17:37.830 --> 17:39.920
Who wants to play Crazy Eights?

17:39.920 --> 17:42.750
(crying)

17:42.750 --> 17:44.830
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bar car and get
a couple of drinks.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.710
And something for you.

17:46.710 --> 17:49.000
(crying)

17:50.830 --> 17:52.790
Hey, Elliot.
Have you seen my phone?

17:52.790 --> 17:53.830
Here you go, boss.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.670
I charged it for you.

17:55.670 --> 17:56.920
Oh. Thank you.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.710
I-- I feel like
I'm forgetting everything.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.710
Well, you are forgetting
one thing.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.790
-What?
-You usually give me
a goodbye kiss.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.620
You do.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.040
And I'm not just trying
to take advantage of the fact

18:07.040 --> 18:08.880
that you have a traumatic
brain injury.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.080
-Okay.

Here's something
interesting. You know
how he remembered her?

He heard a certain song.

-A song?
-Yeah. Closer ,
by Tegan and Sara?

20:16.330 --> 20:17.540
