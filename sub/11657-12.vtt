(mellow music playing)

01:16.367 --> 01:18.033
Ma, will you knock it off?

01:18.433 --> 01:19.800
-What?
-"What?"

01:19.867 --> 01:21.867
We've been washing glasses
for ten minutes.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.300
We've finished three.

01:23.367 --> 01:24.633
So, what's the rush?

01:24.700 --> 01:26.133
It's not like you have a date tonight.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.700
-Ma.
-It's not like you have a date any night.

01:28.767 --> 01:29.834
Or any day.

01:29.900 --> 01:33.500
When I find somebody worth going out with,
I'll go out with him.

01:33.567 --> 01:35.367
Now, will you please stop nagging me?

01:35.433 --> 01:36.467
Nagging?

01:36.533 --> 01:37.834
Is that what it's called

01:37.900 --> 01:39.934
when a mother wants a little happiness
for her daughter?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.367
Ma, I'd like to finish these glasses
before Gloria gets here.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.734
-Your sister's not coming till tomorrow.
-I know.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.600
Oh, Dorothy, could I please borrow
your diamond ring

01:49.667 --> 01:51.333
and your pearl necklace
and your jade bracelet?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.800
Are you planning to come back?

01:54.734 --> 01:56.667
Some time tomorrow morning.
(giggles)

01:56.734 --> 01:57.800
Where are you going?

01:57.867 --> 02:00.934
Oh, out to dinner with Jason,
the director of our community theater.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.900
He's considering me
for the role of Lady Macbeth,

02:03.967 --> 02:06.734
in Mr. William Shakespeare's masterpiece
<i>Macbeth</i>.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.200
I feel sure after our date,
he'll make a decision in my favor.

02:10.266 --> 02:11.867
Oh, come on now, Blanche,

02:11.934 --> 02:14.500
you're not just using this guy
to get a part in a play.

02:14.967 --> 02:15.834
Of course not, Dorothy.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.767
I'm going to let him use me
to get a part in a play.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.266
Blanche, Blanche,

02:21.333 --> 02:23.166
-does he have a friend for Dorothy?
-Oh.

02:23.233 --> 02:27.567
We know this is last minute.
So, we'll take short, bald, fat.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.633
I'm sorry, Sophia,

02:28.700 --> 02:30.967
but I've already palmed Rose off
on his fat friend.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.900
He's a lighting director.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.333
Blanche, I've never been out
with a fat lighting director.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.033
What'll we talk about?

02:39.100 --> 02:41.934
How should I know, honey?
Talk about light bulbs.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.600
That's a good idea.

02:44.967 --> 02:47.800
Maybe he could explain to me
how the three-way bulb works.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.233
I've always wondered about that.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.166
I've always wondered
about the same thing, Rose.

02:53.233 --> 02:56.300
That, and what Jane Pauley
looks like standing up.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.867
Maybe she can't stand up.

03:01.967 --> 03:04.834
Maybe Willard has to carry
her around the set.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.700
Come on, honey.
We don't want to keep our dates waiting.

03:09.266 --> 03:11.934
Wait, Blanche, honey,
aren't you forgetting something?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.834
Oh, no, I never wear underwear.

03:16.567 --> 03:17.867
I mean my jewelry.

03:17.934 --> 03:19.266
Oh, forget it.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.867
Why paint the peacock?

03:22.633 --> 03:23.433
(door closes)

03:23.500 --> 03:25.934
Your sister Gloria never sits home
on a Friday night,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.100
and she's a widow.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.600
Every time I talk to her,
she's going out with another guy.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.066
Ma, she calls you three times a year.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.500
She's very busy.

03:33.567 --> 03:36.066
I'm thrilled she finally found the time
for a visit.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.633
Ma, why do you always
make excuses for her?

03:38.700 --> 03:41.400
I don't make excuses
for any of my children.

03:42.667 --> 03:43.700
Except Phil.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.967
Ma, I think I'll watch TV in my room.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.800
Before you go,
before you go, call this number.

03:51.867 --> 03:52.667
What is it?

03:52.734 --> 03:53.934
A phone number.

03:54.433 --> 03:57.533
I met him at the supermarket.
He asked me to squeeze a melon for him.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.000
He's missing a few fingers,
but everything else seemed to be intact.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.834
Ma, how dare you?

04:06.900 --> 04:08.033
How dare I what?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.233
I was trying to help.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.200
Ma, can you get it through your head
that I do not need your help?

04:13.266 --> 04:16.300
Now please, Ma, get off my back!

04:16.867 --> 04:18.700
Who do you think you're talking to?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.567
Don't you raise your voice to your mother.

04:20.633 --> 04:23.433
Then stop smothering me
and give me some space!

04:23.500 --> 04:25.200
Space? Fine.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.734
Have all the space you want.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.600
Where are you going?

04:28.667 --> 04:31.600
To Mildred's. She's shorter than you.
She doesn't need so much space!

04:33.333 --> 04:34.633
(door slams close)

04:34.700 --> 04:37.700
(mellow music playing)

04:41.467 --> 04:44.800
I can't understand
why the community theater chose <i>Macbeth</i>

04:44.867 --> 04:46.266
for its spring production.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.834
Oh, well, Jason said
they were planning to do a musical,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.600
but the accordion player died.

04:52.066 --> 04:55.367
Besides, I think it's a much bigger
challenge playing lady Macbeth.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.567
Oh, but, Blanche,
you don't have the part yet.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.100
You still have to audition.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.567
Oh, honey, I did.

05:01.233 --> 05:02.300
Last night.

05:03.633 --> 05:06.166
I opened to great reviews.
(giggles)

05:06.734 --> 05:07.800
Morning, everyone.

05:07.867 --> 05:10.767
Clear out, girls. Dorothy needs her space.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.333
Ma, don't start with me.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.633
Now come on, you two,
let's put on our happy faces.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.166
It's a beautiful day, and Gloria's coming.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.400
Why don't you just kiss and make up?

05:22.467 --> 05:24.567
Why don't you just blow it out
your ditty bag?

05:27.934 --> 05:29.266
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.133
I'll get it.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.367
Ma, I said I'd get it.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.700
-I don't want you to get it!
-Let's not argue.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.600
You get it.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.233
What am I, your servant?

05:40.967 --> 05:44.166
-Hi, Ma.
-Gloria!

05:44.233 --> 05:45.767
So good to see you!

05:45.834 --> 05:49.233
Dorothy, it's wonderful to see you, honey.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.033
What is this?
You gift-wrapped your luggage?

05:52.100 --> 05:54.166
-(chuckles)
-Of course not, Ma.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.834
My luggage is at the hotel.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.166
Those are gifts.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.333
-(giggles)
-You're staying at a hotel?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.200
I didn't want to inconvenience anyone.

06:01.266 --> 06:04.900
What inconvenience? You're my daughter.
We shared a body for nine months.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.567
Really, Ma,
I'd be more comfortable at a hotel.

06:09.633 --> 06:10.633
Fine.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.433
Be more comfortable.

06:12.867 --> 06:14.233
I hardly see you.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.633
You never come to visit.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.367
And you finally get here,
you're staying at a hotel.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.300
You could have just called.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.533
Ma, do you want me to stay at the house?

06:22.600 --> 06:24.567
-Do what you want.
-(Gloria scoffs)

06:25.333 --> 06:27.667
Honey, why don't you stay here?
You can share my room.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.867
It's certainly easier
than arguing with her.

06:29.934 --> 06:30.934
Right.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.667
(Dorothy) I'd like you to meet
my two dearest friends.

06:33.734 --> 06:34.834
-This is Rose.
-Hello.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.900
-This is Blanche.
-Hello.

06:35.967 --> 06:38.767
-My sister, Gloria.
-Welcome to Miami.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.800
Oh, well, thank you.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.033
Oh, Gloria,
Sophia's told us so much about you.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.000
I especially enjoyed the story
about your imaginary childhood friend,

06:47.066 --> 06:48.600
David, who lived in the oven.

06:48.667 --> 06:49.734
(laughs)

06:51.100 --> 06:55.667
I had an imaginary friend,
but he'd never tell me his name.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.333
It was during spring planting...

06:58.400 --> 06:59.734
Rose, do you mind?

06:59.800 --> 07:03.166
Gloria's only staying for a week.
I'd like to talk to her before she leaves.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.767
Come on, honey.
Let's get to that audition.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.367
Gloria, just consider this your home.

07:09.433 --> 07:11.367
Oh, thank you. Nice meeting you both.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.300
-I'll tell you about it later.
-All right.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.266
Let's go in the kitchen.
I'll fix us some coffee.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.500
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
First, open these.

07:18.567 --> 07:21.166
Now, there is a new outfit for you

07:21.233 --> 07:25.300
and some warm pajamas
and an electric blanket.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.633
Every time I call you,
it seems you have a cold.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.734
Call more often.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.633
Don't pick on your sister.
Here, she brought you something.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.500
Ah...

07:33.900 --> 07:38.367
It's a gift certificate for a complete
makeover at Elizabeth Arden's.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.967
Maybe now you can get a date.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.600
Please, Ma. I'm not calling Captain Hook.

07:45.867 --> 07:48.667
I am going to freshen up
and call my driver.

07:49.467 --> 07:53.200
Then I'm taking you for lunch
and a shopping spree, Ma.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.867
That Gloria's some special kid.

07:57.934 --> 07:59.533
Oh, Ma, she's your baby.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.000
All mothers think
their babies are special.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.900
That's ridiculous.
I think all my children are special.

08:05.633 --> 08:06.867
Except Phil.

08:08.367 --> 08:09.500
Sure, Ma.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.834
Can I make a little suggestion
when you go for your makeover?

08:13.900 --> 08:15.133
Sure, what is it?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.500
Don't expect a miracle.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.100
(light music playing)

08:32.266 --> 08:33.967
Hi. How was the audition?

08:34.033 --> 08:36.400
Wonderful! I'm 99% sure I got the part.

08:36.467 --> 08:39.200
Oh, Blanche,
there were so many good people there.

08:39.266 --> 08:41.967
-Trust me, I got this part in the sack.
-(giggles)

08:42.900 --> 08:43.900
She means in the bag.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.800
No, honey, she means in the sack.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.567
-Where's Sophia?
-Oh, she and Gloria went shopping.

08:51.633 --> 08:52.767
They haven't come back yet.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.033
Gloria seems like a lovely person.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.567
She is a lovely person.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.667
And she's sophisticated
and worldly and wealthy

08:59.734 --> 09:02.800
and has never had a pimple in her life.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.633
Do I detect a little sibling rivalry?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.066
Oh, I don't know.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.934
I guess I've just always had the feeling

09:09.000 --> 09:12.033
that my parents liked Gloria better
than they liked me.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.900
Oh, I know for a fact
my parents liked my sisters better

09:14.967 --> 09:15.800
than they did me.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.734
Oh, Blanche, that's silly.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.500
How could you know a thing like that?

09:19.567 --> 09:20.633
They told me.

09:21.867 --> 09:26.567
Oh, Blanche, I can't believe
that your parents told you that.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.734
I don't care if they are from the south.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.200
They didn't tell me in words,
they told me in actions.

09:32.266 --> 09:33.600
Like on our birthdays.

09:33.667 --> 09:37.066
Now, when we were little, every year,
my sisters had huge parties

09:37.133 --> 09:40.367
with clowns and magicians
and tons of presents.

09:40.433 --> 09:41.500
Oh, and you didn't.

09:41.567 --> 09:42.433
Well, not exactly.

09:42.500 --> 09:47.400
I did have parties and I had presents,
but I never had a clown.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.834
-Not until I was...
-(both) ...much older.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.834
Yeah.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.500
But that's another story.
(chuckles)

09:54.266 --> 09:57.700
My parents always made each of us
feel like we were the favorite.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.934
They loved all nine of us equally.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.467
We used to have the best Christmas eves.

10:02.533 --> 10:04.467
Daddy would sit
at grandma's old player piano,

10:04.533 --> 10:08.300
and he'd play Christmas carols,
and the children would sing along,

10:08.367 --> 10:13.700
and mother would bring in some homemade
eggnog and snickerdoodles.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.433
And then we'd decorate the tree.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.300
And after daddy had hung the star
at the very top of the tree,

10:21.367 --> 10:24.033
we'd all join hands and pray,

10:24.734 --> 10:26.834
and then daddy would tell us a story

10:26.900 --> 10:30.033
-and tuck us into our feather beds
-Who was your father, Rose?

10:30.100 --> 10:31.033
Michael Landon?

10:37.500 --> 10:40.467
Can I help it
if I came from a happy family?

10:41.033 --> 10:45.200
Well, we had our share of problems.
Believe me, we had some hard times.

10:46.533 --> 10:50.500
Once a mysterious drifter
stole our butter churn.

10:53.467 --> 10:57.266
Well, I guess Ma and Gloria
aren't coming back for dinner.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.900
-What say we go out and grab a hamburger?
-Oh, sounds good to me.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.300
(laughs)

11:01.367 --> 11:04.333
This reminds me of when daddy
used to take us for hamburgers

11:04.400 --> 11:05.200
on Saturday night.

11:05.266 --> 11:08.300
We'd grab our dog, Binky,
and we'd pile into the...

11:12.166 --> 11:15.166
(mellow music playing)

11:19.767 --> 11:22.467
I hope you're not mad at me
for keeping Ma out so late.

11:22.533 --> 11:24.100
Of course not.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.900
-Did the two of you have a good time?
-Ah, wonderful.

11:27.266 --> 11:30.700
I like being with Ma.
I want to spend more time with her.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
And I'd like us to get closer, too.

11:33.667 --> 11:37.500
I wish there was more time.
I see you just packed for the weekend.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.233
Dorothy.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.967
You don't resent me, do you?

11:42.033 --> 11:45.767
Don't be silly. Why would I resent you?
Oh, please.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.266
For having money?

11:47.333 --> 11:48.767
No, I don't resent you.

11:48.834 --> 11:53.533
Oh, I did, a great deal,
as a matter of fact, but I've outgrown it.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.500
Even though my marriage was happy
and yours hit the rocks?

11:56.567 --> 12:01.300
Well, that bothered me for a while,
but I got over it.

12:01.367 --> 12:04.133
Even though all my children
are practicing professionals,

12:04.200 --> 12:05.033
and yours aren't?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.734
Please, Gloria,
I'm happy for your children.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.200
All except Katherine.

12:09.266 --> 12:11.767
No, she really should've taken
the nose job

12:11.834 --> 12:14.400
instead of the Mustang for graduation.

12:16.834 --> 12:21.867
Oh, this reminds me
of when we were little,

12:21.934 --> 12:24.767
and you used to tell me bedtime stories.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.567
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.734
<i>The Bogeyman And The Little Girl.</i>

12:28.800 --> 12:30.667
<i>The Zombie In The Hamper.</i>

12:32.233 --> 12:34.700
<i>-Cannibal Parents.</i>
-(laughs)

12:34.767 --> 12:38.100
I think between the ages of five
and seven you might've gotten...

12:38.166 --> 12:40.033
-two hours' sleep.
-(laughs)

12:41.333 --> 12:44.133
Dorothy, why don't you ever come
to California to visit me?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.767
Well, it's not easy, you know.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.667
I have my job, I have responsibilities.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.700
I've never been invited.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.066
Well, I'm inviting you now.

12:55.133 --> 12:59.000
I have a huge house with servants
and an ocean view.

12:59.967 --> 13:02.500
And Bert Convy shops in my grocery store.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.533
Bert Convy? Let's leave now.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.166
I was telling Ma about it, you know,

13:09.233 --> 13:11.000
how great the weather is

13:11.066 --> 13:14.000
and how she would never have
to lift a finger for anything,

13:14.433 --> 13:17.467
and she really liked the idea
of maybe coming out.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.033
Oh, I think it would be great

13:19.100 --> 13:21.300
if she were to come out
for a visit sometime.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.266
Well, I was thinking of more
than just a visit, Dorothy.

13:25.734 --> 13:28.133
I was thinking of a permanent arrangement.

13:29.467 --> 13:30.300
What do you mean?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.900
I want Ma to come live with me.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.433
So, I asked her to and...

13:37.266 --> 13:38.633
she said yes.

13:39.633 --> 13:42.633
(somber music playing)

13:51.567 --> 13:53.233
Hi, Ma. Whatcha doing?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.400
Having a toga party.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.066
Never mind.
I'll talk to you when you're not busy.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.967
I'm not busy, but do what you have to.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.700
Gloria tells me
you're gonna go live with her.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.367
That's right. I think it's best.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.266
Isn't that kind of a fast decision?

14:12.333 --> 14:13.900
Why, you think I'm making a mistake?

14:13.967 --> 14:17.467
Oh, no, of course not.
I mean, not if you think it's best.

14:17.934 --> 14:19.066
What do you think?

14:19.133 --> 14:22.600
Well, I can understand
why you'd wanna live with her.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.100
I mean, she can give you
so much more than I can.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.433
You'd live in a mansion,
you'd have servants,

14:28.500 --> 14:30.834
you'd do your grocery shopping
with Bert Convy.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.667
And you'll have your space,

14:34.033 --> 14:35.767
and you can sit home on Friday night

14:35.834 --> 14:38.066
and become an old maid
like your Aunt Regina,

14:38.133 --> 14:39.600
and you won't have to listen to me nag.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.700
Then I guess it's all settled.

14:44.033 --> 14:46.266
-I guess so.
-Yeah, well, I'd better get to work.

14:46.934 --> 14:48.400
-Ma?
-Yeah?

14:50.934 --> 14:55.367
If you need any help moving,
just let me know, ok?

14:56.934 --> 14:57.967
I'll do that.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.900
(whistling "Greensleeves")

15:06.433 --> 15:07.467
(sighs)

15:07.533 --> 15:09.166
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.600
Blanche, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

15:13.667 --> 15:17.033
Oh, goodness! I'd better sit down.
Dorothy just said she had bad news.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.500
Oh, well...

15:18.567 --> 15:21.033
-Since you got here first, you go ahead--
-No, you go ahead.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.867
-No, really.
-Look, I insist.

15:22.934 --> 15:23.834
You got here first.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.734
Girls, please!

15:25.800 --> 15:28.400
Will one of you just say something
so I can become hysterical,

15:28.467 --> 15:30.500
eat a box of Mallomars
and get it over with?

15:32.867 --> 15:34.133
Ok.

15:35.033 --> 15:35.934
Jason called.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.533
You got a part in <i>Macbeth</i>,

15:38.600 --> 15:41.433
but I'm afraid it isn't the part
you were hoping for.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.500
What part did I get?

15:45.767 --> 15:47.133
Witch number three.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.800
A witch?

15:53.500 --> 15:56.633
He cast me as a witch?

15:57.233 --> 15:58.800
Well, who got Lady Macbeth?

15:58.867 --> 15:59.900
Don't tell me.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.700
Probably one of those
little theater groupies

16:01.767 --> 16:03.800
with a mattress strapped to her back.

16:05.967 --> 16:06.834
No, it isn't.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.100
It's me.

16:12.233 --> 16:15.834
(laughs)
Oh!

16:17.233 --> 16:19.033
You're pulling my leg.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.300
He picked you over me?

16:22.367 --> 16:24.767
-Listen, I hate having to--
-Hold on, Dorothy.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.300
This is a joke, isn't it?
He didn't really pick you over me.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.567
Oh, Blanche, I didn't even want the part,
but Jason said I have presence.

16:33.633 --> 16:38.166
-Listen, I really have to go to work--
-He actually picked you over me?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.500
I do not believe this.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.767
I have been had.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.734
I know.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.433
And you still didn't get the part.

16:51.233 --> 16:52.367
All right, Dorothy.

16:52.433 --> 16:53.233
I'm ready.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.133
Now, tell me your bad news.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.433
My mother is leaving.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.033
She's going to move in
with my sister, Gloria.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.467
-Oh, you're kidding.
-Oh, Sophia can't leave.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.934
-She just can't.
-She's a grown woman, Rose.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.266
She can do anything she wants.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.500
But why is she leaving?
Isn't she happy here?

17:09.567 --> 17:11.500
Well, I guess she thinks
she'll be happier with Gloria.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.333
Well, what about us?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.967
Who's going to keep after us
and make us linguine

17:17.033 --> 17:19.133
and tell us stories about Sicily?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.467
I don't know, Rose.

17:20.533 --> 17:23.367
Maybe Mary Poppins has an Italian cousin.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.467
Dorothy, do you want her to go?

17:26.533 --> 17:28.734
Well, of course not.
It's breaking my heart.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.200
Well, then, I for one,
am not gonna let her go without a fight.

17:31.266 --> 17:32.500
Me neither.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.533
Sophia's like a mother to us all.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.266
It just wouldn't be the same without her.

17:36.333 --> 17:40.400
But if she wants to live with Gloria,
she has every right to do it,

17:40.467 --> 17:43.000
and we have no right
to make her feel guilty about it.

17:43.066 --> 17:44.233
Now I really have to go.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.266
(scoffs)

17:46.333 --> 17:49.300
Well, what a terrible morning this is.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.433
Sophia's leaving.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.567
And I'm playing an ugly old witch
'cause you stole my part.

17:55.767 --> 17:59.266
Oh, Blanche, I know how much
that part means to you.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.900
You know what I was thinking?

18:00.967 --> 18:03.233
You could go on for me one night.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.533
Well, Rose, isn't that sweet?

18:06.600 --> 18:10.133
And I do love you for it, honey,
but I just couldn't.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.867
I could never fit this trim little body

18:12.934 --> 18:15.800
into that big old tent of a dress
they're gonna have to make for you.

18:17.533 --> 18:20.533
(mellow music playing)

18:23.600 --> 18:26.867
Gloria, does your luggage have to sit
in the middle of the room?

18:26.934 --> 18:30.066
No, it could also roll over and play dead.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.834
Ha ha ha ha ha.

18:32.834 --> 18:33.800
Something bothering you?

18:33.867 --> 18:35.533
'Course not. What makes you say that?

18:36.033 --> 18:37.734
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-No.

18:39.667 --> 18:40.467
Yes.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.333
You come here with your limo

18:43.400 --> 18:45.467
and your presents
and your designer luggage,

18:45.533 --> 18:47.433
and you think you're better
than everybody else.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.233
You have everything!
Do you have to have Ma, too?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.100
I mean, all these years,
you've been her favorite.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.166
All I wanted was this time with her.

18:55.633 --> 18:58.166
Dorothy, you are crazy.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.467
You're ma's favorite.
You always have been.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.734
Oh, come on, Gloria.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
You're the one
who always got all the attention.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.700
Sure, I got attention,

19:05.767 --> 19:09.100
but only because you were the strongest,
the smartest,

19:09.166 --> 19:10.967
and you could take care of yourself,

19:11.033 --> 19:14.900
which ma constantly pointed out
in English and Italian.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.166
Ma said this about me?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.333
Think back, Dorothy.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.066
When we were kids
and Ma and Pop were working,

19:23.133 --> 19:25.433
-who did ma always leave in charge?
-Me.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
Right.

19:26.567 --> 19:27.433
And do you know why?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.967
Yeah, because Phil played with matches.

19:30.934 --> 19:36.100
No, because Ma trusted you
with responsibility.

19:36.166 --> 19:39.100
In her eyes,
I could never be as good as you.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.400
Ma looked at you
and saw a wonderful future.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.700
She looked at me
and hoped I would marry rich.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.367
Which I did.

19:47.967 --> 19:48.934
Very rich.

19:49.734 --> 19:52.734
Why didn't she ever say any of this?

19:53.467 --> 19:54.266
She did.

19:55.233 --> 19:58.000
Who does she turn to
whenever she's in trouble, hmm?

19:58.567 --> 20:00.300
Who did she come to live with?

20:01.066 --> 20:01.867
Her favorite...

20:02.433 --> 20:03.266
you.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.400
Oh, come on, Gloria.
That is the dumbest thing I ever heard.

20:08.033 --> 20:11.333
Dorothy, even with all my money,

20:11.400 --> 20:13.567
you have so much more than I do.

20:13.633 --> 20:16.400
You have ma and your friends
and your work and...

20:16.900 --> 20:17.700
(scoffs)

20:19.100 --> 20:23.233
Your life just seems
so much more important than mine,

20:23.834 --> 20:26.800
and I wanted to take
a little bit back with me.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.100
It's not what ma wants.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.033
You think she wants to stay?

20:32.834 --> 20:34.300
I know she wants to stay.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.667
(sighs)

20:36.734 --> 20:38.266
I'm gonna go talk to her.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.100
Are you all right?

20:40.166 --> 20:42.100
Oh, sure.
(chuckles)

20:42.166 --> 20:43.467
I've got all I need.

20:43.934 --> 20:46.266
And you also have a sister who loves you.

20:48.133 --> 20:49.867
And Pop's nose.

20:53.734 --> 20:54.533
(door closes)

20:55.867 --> 20:56.667
(knocks)

20:58.467 --> 20:59.734
Ma, you're not leaving.

21:00.734 --> 21:03.300
You're staying here
with Rose and Blanche and me.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.567
Hey, if I wanna leave, I'll leave.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.467
I'm free, single and 80!

21:09.500 --> 21:12.433
I'm not going to take no for an answer.
You're staying.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.667
I should have known
you couldn't make it without me.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.367
You're right. I can't.

21:18.433 --> 21:20.800
And neither can Blanche
and neither can Rose.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.700
Of course, not Rose.
The woman can hardly find her way to work!

21:25.867 --> 21:26.934
Then you'll stay?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.567
Not so fast.

21:28.633 --> 21:31.433
You're gonna have to make a few changes
around here first.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.834
What kind of changes?

21:32.900 --> 21:35.400
Like you can't hang around me
all the time.

21:36.066 --> 21:38.567
You need your space, I need mine.

21:38.633 --> 21:39.467
Ok?

21:39.533 --> 21:40.600
Ok, Ma.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.700
So, maybe I'll stick around
and look after you three stooges.

21:44.767 --> 21:46.033
-(laughs)
-(knock on door)

21:46.100 --> 21:46.934
Come!

21:48.433 --> 21:51.700
Oh, Gloria,
I just made a very important decision

21:51.767 --> 21:53.033
I think you should know about.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.700
What is it, Ma?

21:55.433 --> 21:57.467
I decided to stay here in Miami.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.867
I had to.

22:00.934 --> 22:02.333
She begged.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.200
It was pathetic.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.967
It's ok, Ma.

22:08.367 --> 22:09.533
I understand.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.967
You're a good daughter, Gloria.

22:12.033 --> 22:13.734
You're both good daughters.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.900
Most people my age have children
trying to get rid of them.

22:16.967 --> 22:19.400
My children are fighting over
who gets to keep me.

22:19.867 --> 22:22.367
You don't know how much that means
to an old lady.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.367
Honey, you don't know
how much you mean to us.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.266
-And I love you.
-(chuckles)

22:28.633 --> 22:29.967
I love all my children.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.400
Even Phil?

22:31.467 --> 22:34.233
Sure, but don't tell him.
He'll wanna borrow money.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.533
(laughing)

22:36.667 --> 22:39.667
(mellow music playing)

22:41.633 --> 22:42.700
Hi, girls.

22:42.767 --> 22:44.967
-Oh, hi. How was dinner?
-Great.

22:45.033 --> 22:48.200
I ate a lot,
Ma drank a lot, Gloria paid a lot.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.934
Oh, I'm so glad the three of you
got things worked out

22:52.000 --> 22:53.266
and that Sophia's not leaving.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.433
Oh, me too.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.400
That spunky little lady
sure does add life to this place.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.467
Oh, and the stories she tells.

22:59.533 --> 23:02.433
And there's always a little gem of wisdom

23:02.500 --> 23:06.800
hidden deep, deep, deep inside.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.333
Listen, when I thought I was moving,

23:11.400 --> 23:13.367
I was going to give
each one of you a gift,

23:13.433 --> 23:15.266
but I want you to have them anyway.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.500
Why, Sophia, how sweet!

23:17.567 --> 23:19.166
Oh, honey, you shouldn't have.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.633
Oh, Ma, this is so lovely.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.633
And so familiar.

23:27.266 --> 23:28.834
This is mine.

23:30.467 --> 23:32.333
I thought the cleaner lost it.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.133
I told you the cleaner lost it. I took it.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.400
I needed something
to go with my black sweater.

23:37.467 --> 23:39.100
This is my black sweater.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.667
-I know. It goes great with--
-My pearls.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.700
Well, enjoy and be healthy.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.100
I wonder if she's seen my umbrella
with the duck handle.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.500
You know, I haven't been able to find
my ankle bracelet.

23:57.567 --> 24:00.233
Come on, I think it's time
to search her room again.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.400
(lively music playing)

24:13.500 --> 24:16.500
(closing theme music playing)
