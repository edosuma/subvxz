<i>I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I?</i>

00:07.470 --> 00:08.580
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.580 --> 00:09.040
Castle.

00:09.060 --> 00:09.470
Castle.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.900
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.910 --> 00:14.310
Every writer needs inspiration,
and I found mine.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.240
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.250 --> 00:15.670
Beckett.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.219
Beckett.

00:16.230 --> 00:18.060
Nikki Heat?
The character he's basing on you.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.070
<i>And thanks to my friendship with
the Mayor, I get to be on her case.</i>

00:21.080 --> 00:22.860
I 'd be happy to let you spank me.

00:22.910 --> 00:24.320
<i>And together we catch killers.</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:26.180
Make a pretty good team, you know.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.290
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.010
Turner and Hooch.

00:28.030 --> 00:30.010
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

What's so special about world famous
mystery novelist Richard Castle?

00:50.740 --> 00:55.010
He's rich, he's handsome and he's
basing his next best-seller on you.

00:55.020 --> 00:58.970
Tell me detective Beckett, what's it like
being the inspiration for thrill-master

00:58.970 --> 01:01.000
Richard Castle's new character Nikki Heat?

01:01.960 --> 01:06.140
On behalf of the N.Y.P.D., it has been
a pleasure to offer Mr. Castle

01:06.160 --> 01:08.060
insight into the profession.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.510
Given all his best-sellers, it's obvious
Mr. Castle has tremendous insight

01:11.530 --> 01:14.700
into the criminal mind.  I'm told in
many occasions his participation

01:14.710 --> 01:16.690
was essential to solving your
toughest cases.

01:18.190 --> 01:18.690
Really?

01:19.070 --> 01:20.150
You were told that?

01:20.690 --> 01:21.470
By who?

01:21.590 --> 01:22.750
By Castle.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.820
Could you excuse me for a moment?

01:28.270 --> 01:28.790
Sir?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.100
Could I talk to you in private
for a moment please?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.560
- Beckett I have a couple...
- Now.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.600
We had a deal Beckett.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.490
The deal is off.

01:41.570 --> 01:42.200
What's the problem?

01:42.460 --> 01:45.460
Not only does he have the
bachelor party cop twins out there

01:45.460 --> 01:49.250
using him as a stripper pole while
I make "nicey-nice" with the press,

01:49.270 --> 01:50.560
- but do you know what he said?
- No.

01:50.590 --> 01:54.160
He said that he has been instrumental
in helping us solve crimes.

01:54.170 --> 01:54.900
Well, hasn't he?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.050
That's not the point.

01:57.060 --> 02:01.190
Do you know how hard it is for N.Y.P.D.
to get good press? I mean in a magazine

02:01.200 --> 02:02.400
that people actually read.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.140
This article is very important to the Mayor.
Therefore, we are going to cooperate.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.780
Do I make myself clear?

02:12.360 --> 02:13.560
Okay. Fine.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.220
It was nice to meet you.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.970
We should have photo shoots here more often.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.600
Hey Beckett, how come you don't
wear a uniform like that?

02:22.620 --> 02:24.900
Because I don't want to get paid in singles.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.100
Hey.

02:27.940 --> 02:33.370
Oh, hey, don't we have that thing?
No. Yeah, you know, that thing with that guy?

02:34.160 --> 02:36.720
Oh, yeah. The thing with the guy.
Excuse us.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.560
I just wanted you to know I had
nothing to do with this.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.290
I mean, it was the magazine, well, the Mayor
thought it would be good press.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.150
- You don't have to explain yourself.
- Really?

02:49.170 --> 02:49.910
<i>Really.</i>

02:50.000 --> 02:53.740
See? I don't care anymore.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have

02:53.750 --> 02:55.450
an interview to get back to.

02:57.050 --> 03:00.900
- What did I do that was so wrong?
- The one thing I asked you not to do.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.850
Okay, so you asked me not to look
into your Mother's murder but

03:02.860 --> 03:05.100
- look at what I found!
- It doesn't matter what you found.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.930
I put that all behind me a long time ago.
We can get back to the interview now.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.440
No. You're going to have to reschedule.
We just caught a body.

03:12.210 --> 03:15.840
- So sorry to step out on you Amy.
- Ooh, are you kidding? It's perfect.

03:15.910 --> 03:18.680
A chance to see Castle action?
Our readers will love it.

03:18.710 --> 03:21.320
Well we wouldn't want to disappoint
your readers, now would we Detective?

03:33.210 --> 03:36.210
- Hey, can we talk about this please?
- There's nothing to talk about.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.650
Well just at least let me know what
I can do to make it up to you.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.000
- You could leave me alone.
- Yes, well, I tried that and it didn't work.

03:42.270 --> 03:43.900
Hey, I could buy you a pony.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.660
Focus! Castle. Crime scene, okay?

03:54.550 --> 03:55.540
It's raining men.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.100
Castle, what are you doing here?

03:59.180 --> 04:00.770
Don't worry.
We're still mad at him.

04:00.810 --> 04:03.800
- Guy in a tree,mum and dad
bickering,seems like old times.
- Mm-Hmm.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.900
How's it going up there?

04:04.900 --> 04:08.900
I got tree branches poking my boobs
and spotlight shining up my booty .

04:09.000 --> 04:11.690
Could be worse.
You could be wearing a skirt.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.200
When I come down,
I'm g-na smack you.

04:15.510 --> 04:17.399
- I'll be looking forward to that.
- Here.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.200
Vic's a white male, late 30s.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.900
Judging from the cracked branches,

04:22.900 --> 04:26.000
I'm guessing he did a superman
off the top of that building.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.500
Vic's name is John Allen.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.400
I.D. has him on the upper west side.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.640
- Business card has him in insurance.
- Mm.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.790
- Is it a suicide?
- It's not a suicide.

04:35.780 --> 04:39.940
- How do you know?
- Um, the building is too short.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.180
He'd want to kill himself,
not cripple himself.

04:42.190 --> 04:44.900
If you want to die, you're gonna head for concrete, not a tree.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.000
Judging frome angle of descent,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.800
I'd say that guy was thrown
off the building.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.320
Since it clearly wasn't
a suicide, how did he die?

04:52.680 --> 04:54.250
There are signs of strangulation.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.200
It looks like his windpipe was crushed.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.730
- Any ligature marks?
- Nope.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.090
"Ligature" refers to anything that ties or binds,

05:00.100 --> 05:01.400
like a rope or a belt.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.600
Lack of any marks suggests
he was strangled by hand.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.710
Huh. You really know your stuff,
no wonder they like having you around.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.830
You know what? He's such
an incredible resource,

05:09.850 --> 05:12.330
It seems like a shame to waste
his talents here in the field.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.730
Would you mind going back
to the morgue with dr Parish

05:14.740 --> 05:16.580
to see what else we can
find out about the vic?

05:17.060 --> 05:19.030
Don't you think I'd be of more use
here at the crime scene?

05:19.060 --> 05:22.710
Oh, no. We're just gonna knock on doors and
see what else we can stir up.

05:22.850 --> 05:24.580
You know, boring police stuff.

05:24.810 --> 05:27.210
Fine. But I was serious about the pony.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.470
Come on, I'll show you the, uh, morgue... mobile.

05:33.190 --> 05:34.270
Anything in the wallet?

05:34.300 --> 05:37.390
Nope. Dry cleaning ticket,
I.D., two credit cards.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.010
Cash was missing, though.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.710
That's a long way to go for a robbery.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.210
You mean we have to ride with the body?

05:50.170 --> 05:51.480
You can take my seat up front.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.400
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.200
I'm used to hanging out with stiffs.

06:06.440 --> 06:06.940
Hi.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.200
Unh-Unh. You do not
get to say hi to me.

06:09.220 --> 06:10.850
I'm just doing my girl a favour.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.010
Oh, you, too, huh?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.260
Well, what did you expect?

06:14.760 --> 06:17.090
Beckett spent the first
three years of being a cop

06:17.110 --> 06:18.540
trying to solve her mother's murder.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.970
It took everything that
she had to put it behind her.

06:20.980 --> 06:21.980
You couldn't respect that?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.180
What was I supposed to do,
not tell her what I found?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.150
- What you found?
- Oh, she didn't tell you, did she?

06:29.820 --> 06:32.400
Three people were killed
the same way her mother was

06:32.420 --> 06:33.680
right about the same time.

06:33.690 --> 06:36.670
One of them was a former
law student of hers.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.490
Another one, a documents clerk.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.030
The third one, a lawyer for a non profit.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.880
Wait, the M.E. at the time
didn't make the connection?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.380
If he did, he buried it.

06:45.650 --> 06:46.930
Did you talk to him?

06:47.130 --> 06:48.340
He died four years ago.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.280
So you see why I had to tell her.

06:53.310 --> 06:54.480
What did she say?

06:56.770 --> 06:57.730
That we were done.

06:59.030 --> 07:00.120
And then she just walked--

07:05.440 --> 07:06.940
Don't move! Don't move!

07:06.960 --> 07:07.630
Whoa!

07:09.770 --> 07:10.590
<i>Get the body!</i>

07:15.340 --> 07:15.920
<i>Go!</i>

07:16.600 --> 07:17.570
Don't move!

07:18.510 --> 07:20.160
<i>Come on, move, move, move...</i>

07:26.330 --> 07:29.170
Is it just me, or was that
really, really weird?

07:29.740 --> 07:34.690
Season 2 episode 8 
"Deep in death"

07:36.320 --> 07:38.070
- Well?
- He'll live.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.420
What, no brain damage?

07:40.430 --> 07:44.170
He has some, it happened way before
tonight,and it was probably self-inflicted.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.620
Ahh. Good times.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.310
- How's Lois Lane?
- Who, reporter chick?

07:47.370 --> 07:49.110
We took her statement and we sent her home.

07:49.310 --> 07:52.260
We got an A.P.B. on the Sedan,
C.S.U are combing the rooftop,

07:52.300 --> 07:54.650
And we got units looking for surveillance
footage of the crash site.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.520
You know what I don't get

07:55.620 --> 07:58.500
- is who would steal a dead body?
- Oh, plenty of people.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.030
Uh, organ harvesters,
cadaver less med students,

08:02.120 --> 08:05.500
Satanists , mad scientists looking
to create their own monster.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.740
Or the guys who killed him might
have left some evidence behind.

08:09.140 --> 08:09.730
Boring.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.590
How about a spy

08:11.780 --> 08:14.600
having swallowed a top-secret microchip

08:15.000 --> 08:19.410
that the enemy forces murder him over
before the C.I.A. can get a hold of him?

08:20.200 --> 08:23.820
As much as we all appreciate your insightful
and incredibly believable theories,

08:23.830 --> 08:26.590
miss "Cosmo" is gone, so I believe
 you can go home now.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.900
Home? No. No, no, no.
This--This case just got good.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.900
And-- And I'm-- I'm a witness.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.010
All right, I'll let you work
this one case with me

08:40.020 --> 08:42.360
if you promise to leave
me alone when it's over

08:42.380 --> 08:44.550
and not to weasel your way back in.

08:45.620 --> 08:46.380
Deal.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.500
But fair warning, detective.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.870
I will make you change your mind.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.070
- I won't.
- You will.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.600
<i>So what's the next step, victim's family?</i>

08:55.780 --> 08:58.280
Huh. I didn't think she'd take him back.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.330
Mrs. Allen?

09:04.750 --> 09:05.210
Yes.

09:05.410 --> 09:06.520
It's about your husband.

09:07.950 --> 09:10.000
He was just right here

09:10.060 --> 09:13.720
just a couple of hours ago,
and now he's dead. I...

09:16.840 --> 09:19.150
Do you know of any reason why
he'd be in that part of town?

09:19.310 --> 09:19.900
No.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.810
His office is, uh, in mid town.

09:23.820 --> 09:24.990
It's nowhere near ninth.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.860
What time did he leave the apartment?

09:27.560 --> 09:28.680
Around 6:00.

09:29.550 --> 09:31.520
He had just gotten back from his trip

09:31.550 --> 09:34.480
And, uh, he said he needed
to catch up on some paperwork.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.710
He said he'd only be gone
for a couple of hours.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.650
You said a trip?

09:39.160 --> 09:41.770
He was in Albuquerque on a training seminar.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.150
It was just two nights.

09:44.940 --> 09:47.050
Did you notice anything unusual recently,

09:47.080 --> 09:48.520
any strange behaviour?

09:49.670 --> 09:51.420
Well, he-- he had to work late

09:51.560 --> 09:53.520
a little more often than usual.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.990
But I mean, in this economy, who doesn't?

09:57.800 --> 10:00.650
He had to lay off half
his department last year.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.280
And you're sure he was working late?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.930
What are you saying, that he was cheating?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.030
Every night, he would
walk through that door,

10:12.040 --> 10:15.310
and the kids would just
race into his arms, okay?

10:16.090 --> 10:17.480
And now he's gone.

10:18.540 --> 10:21.630
So don't ask me if he was
really working late.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.090
Tell me why he was killed.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.940
- He didn't mean to imply--
- What about phone calls,

10:25.960 --> 10:27.630
- maybe late at night?
- Castle.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.960
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

10:31.740 --> 10:33.310
One of the guys that John fired,

10:33.320 --> 10:34.670
Max Haverstock.

10:34.690 --> 10:36.580
He would call him up late at night,

10:36.610 --> 10:39.050
and he would yell at him,
all sorts of things.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.390
I guess he was hurting,
he needed money.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.640
And I- I told John that he
should just hang up on him.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.320
John said no, he--
he couldn't do that.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.720
Did he ever give him money?

10:49.780 --> 10:51.960
My husband didn't believe in handouts.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.280
He believed that a man should make his way.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.890
Where is he?

11:00.300 --> 11:01.400
I'd like to say good bye.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.880
About that. Um...

11:10.940 --> 11:11.850
That was awkward.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.440
It just-- it doesn't make any sense.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.480
The guy's got a stable middle-
class life-- good job, good family.

11:19.620 --> 11:21.000
Maybe his friend Max was jealous.

11:21.020 --> 11:23.960
Yeah, maybe enough to kill him,
but to steal his body?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.320
Hey, Esposito. I need you
to look up a friend of the vic.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.800
Max Haverstock.

11:31.210 --> 11:31.690
Yeah.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.300
Okay, find him and, uh, bring him in.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.470
Dad. Thank god you're home. Are you okay?

11:45.510 --> 11:49.290
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
- Fine? Masked gunmen, body snatchers?

11:49.350 --> 11:50.890
I text'd you like a thousand times.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.270
Oh, I'm sorry.
My phone must've been off.

11:53.470 --> 11:54.920
How--How did you know?

11:54.950 --> 11:55.680
Beckett called.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.200
Really?

11:58.370 --> 12:00.460
She just wanted to let us
know you were all right.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.370
Mm-hmm.

12:01.870 --> 12:03.490
So has she forgiven you?

12:03.500 --> 12:06.180
Uh, not exactly, mother.
But I'm working on it.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.820
She has agreed to let me help on the case.

12:08.860 --> 12:11.300
Well, that's a start, I suppose.

12:11.310 --> 12:14.920
It is more than a start.
It is an opportunity.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.060
She may have built a wall between us,

12:17.090 --> 12:20.550
but I am going to...
build a door in that wall,

12:20.580 --> 12:23.000
or put up a ladder or dig a hole.

12:23.490 --> 12:26.340
- You have a strategy?
- Be my usual, charming self.

12:26.390 --> 12:30.090
Uh-huh. What about plan "b"?

12:32.970 --> 12:34.670
So was it awful? Were you scared?

12:34.690 --> 12:37.260
Me, scared? No way. Come on.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.780
- Now excuse me while I change my shorts.
- Dad.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.460
No, I was scared. But all they
were after was the body.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.610
- Why?
- Why indeed.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.630
"Dad, where are you?"
"Dad, are you all right?"

12:47.660 --> 12:49.260
"Dad, call us right away!"

12:49.270 --> 12:52.270
"Dad, can I go see 'Fame' with Owen on Friday?"

12:54.390 --> 12:55.850
Your concern is touching.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.940
Okay, that one was after
I knew you were all right.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.560
Yeah, but I thought we were
gonna go see that together.

12:59.590 --> 13:03.100
We were, and we still can, but he invited
me to go see it with him next Friday.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.420
You'd rather go with your boyfriend than your dad?
What is wrong with you?

13:08.720 --> 13:10.260
If you really want me
to go with you, I will.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.620
No, no. You tell Owen
he has won this round.

13:13.670 --> 13:16.070
But I got dibs
on "A Christmas carol".

13:16.110 --> 13:16.800
Thanks, dad.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.180
And I'm glad you weren't killed
by body snatchers.

13:19.200 --> 13:19.910
Me, too.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.400
Oh, they remade "Fame"
and "A Christmas carol."

13:23.400 --> 13:25.630
Has Hollywood totally run out of ideas?

13:25.660 --> 13:28.070
Well, they just optioned, uh,
"Asteroids" the video game.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.020
So my guess is yes.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.220
But Ryan Reynolds is playing
the wee triangle, and he's good.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.030
Are you sure this is the guy?

13:39.220 --> 13:40.530
Maxwell Haverstock.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.130
And he confirmed he knew the vic.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.880
This guy couldn't throw a wet
sponge off the roof, let alone a body.

13:52.310 --> 13:54.110
- Mr. Haverstock.
- Yes.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.700
Do you know why you're here?

13:55.910 --> 13:58.500
No. Uh, they just told me
I needed to come in.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.880
It's about John Allen.
He was murdered last night.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.230
Oh, that's terrible.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.660
- You and he were friends?
- Uh, we had adjoining cubicles.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.800
When was the last time you saw him?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.920
Oh, uh, not since "d" day.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.770
That's, uh, that's what we called it.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.720
- You know, "d" for downsizing.
- You were let go?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.740
- Yeah.
- I bet that made you pretty angry.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.620
Yeah, 15 years, we worked there together.

14:21.670 --> 14:23.580
You know, you'd think
that would mean something.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.000
You'd think that loyalty
would be worth something.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.450
You know what it's worth?
A kick in the teeth!

14:28.930 --> 14:31.460
- Did you ever called and tell John that?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.960
Yeah, I told him we didn't
deserve to be treated like that.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.780
But I promised him, one day,
the worm would turn,

14:36.830 --> 14:39.210
cause karma's a nasty little bitch.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.620
Is that why you killed him?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.460
- Who?
- John.

14:45.450 --> 14:46.780
Why would I want to kill John?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.460
For firing you.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.290
He didn't fire me. We were
let go together on "d" day.

14:52.330 --> 14:55.870
Uh, fortunately, I was able
to find another job.

14:56.650 --> 14:57.870
He didn't have a job?

14:59.230 --> 15:02.150
I guess he, uh, doesn't
have to look for one any more.

15:04.710 --> 15:07.530
<i>Hey, yo, Beckett.</i>
Story checks.

15:07.580 --> 15:10.630
John Allen was laid off eight months
ago when the A.I.G. crisis hit.

15:10.850 --> 15:12.310
What about Albuquerque?

15:12.350 --> 15:15.480
No record of a John Allen coming back
from any flight in the tristate area.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.030
Well, it makes you wonder what
else he lied to his wife about.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.620
And how he paid all of his bills.
Beckett.

15:22.460 --> 15:24.320
All right. Uh, thank you.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.290
They found his body...

15:27.910 --> 15:28.520
Again.

15:33.330 --> 15:34.270
What happened?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.730
Someone...

15:37.760 --> 15:39.230
operated on him.

15:39.990 --> 15:41.030
Operated?

15:41.220 --> 15:43.580
They cut him open and took
all of his organs out.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.900
- Oh! Ouch.
- Wow.

15:46.430 --> 15:47.950
Somebody hated his guts.

15:55.850 --> 15:57.580
The guys who did this weren't surgeons.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.250
The cuts are sloppy--
Box cutters and kitchen knives.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.720
Any idea what they were looking for?

16:01.990 --> 16:05.710
I ran a tox screen and found nothing in the blood stream.
But in the body cavity itself,

16:05.730 --> 16:07.590
there were trace amounts of powder cocaine.

16:07.610 --> 16:09.810
- He was their drug mule.
- Guess they couldn't wait for him

16:09.840 --> 16:11.850
to pass the packets the old-fashioned way.

16:12.120 --> 16:12.970
I don't buy it.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.890
How does a middle-aged insurance actuary

16:16.910 --> 16:18.740
with no history of substance abuse,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.580
no criminal record, become a drug mule?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.150
And this was not a bad guy.

16:23.490 --> 16:26.290
You don't just fill out an
ad on Craigslist. You gotta--

16:26.530 --> 16:29.530
You gotta know people, bad people.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.970
As freaky as all this is,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.020
Let's not forget it happened post-mortem.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.250
The actual cause of death is up here.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.390
Bruise pattern indicates the assailant
strangled him with both hands.

16:40.350 --> 16:42.440
The bruising is a little
lighter right there.

16:42.540 --> 16:43.880
What would account for that?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.030
Dislocated or broken finger maybe.

16:46.290 --> 16:47.660
Maybe he's fancy.

16:48.190 --> 16:50.620
Strangled people with
his pinkie sticking out.

16:52.610 --> 16:53.650
Like tea.

16:54.770 --> 16:56.550
<i>I just got off with homeland security.</i>

16:56.590 --> 16:58.170
Passport records indicate that

16:58.370 --> 17:01.010
John Allen was coming back
from Mexico, not New Mexico.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.470
No criminal history, healthy,
white, middle-class,

17:04.500 --> 17:06.800
they wouldn't have looked
at him twice at customs.

17:06.819 --> 17:09.839
The guy had skills. Why would
he do something so stupid?

17:09.849 --> 17:11.329
Because he had to.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.420
I just went over financials with the wife.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.060
How bad?

17:15.079 --> 17:17.470
They've been living on credit
cards the last six months.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.760
She had no idea. She thought
everything was fine.

17:19.819 --> 17:22.079
Well, if he wasn't going to work every day?
Where was he going?

17:22.119 --> 17:23.369
He was applying for jobs.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.630
I found hundreds of cover
letters and resumes on his computer.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.270
I don't understand. Why didn't
they just sell the apartment?

17:29.320 --> 17:31.530
- Wasn't worth the mortgage.
- Man, that's harsh.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.660
Life insurance?

17:32.740 --> 17:34.930
Mm. Stopped making payments
four months ago.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.150
Guy was basically worthless,
alive or dead.

17:37.270 --> 17:38.510
Yeah, Ryan here.

17:39.270 --> 17:41.320
You know, I get desperation,

17:41.350 --> 17:44.050
I get needing the money,
I even get being a drug mule.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.820
What I don't get is,
where did he get the job?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.780
<i>Yeah, thanks, Bill.</i>

17:49.190 --> 17:50.190
That was C.S.U.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.700
Because our prep were wearing gloves,

17:51.710 --> 17:53.510
the only prints they could
grab off the car belong to

17:53.520 --> 17:55.710
the owner,who reported it
stolen last night.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.750
Looks like we're not gonna
grab a break on this one.

17:58.030 --> 17:59.730
What about the glove
we found at the scene?

17:59.870 --> 18:01.600
Dusted it, too. Nothing.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.190
Did you dust inside?

18:03.900 --> 18:04.550
Inside?

18:05.100 --> 18:06.280
Yeah, inside the glove.

18:15.510 --> 18:16.920
You want me to put on some music?

18:18.480 --> 18:20.460
Whenever they do this sort
of thing on "CSI",

18:21.020 --> 18:24.360
they always do it to music
in poorly lit rooms.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.310
Kinda reminds me of porn.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.020
Zip it, Castle.

18:33.990 --> 18:35.590
Ever consider becoming a mohel ?

18:36.660 --> 18:38.860
Keep talking, and I'll practice on you.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.970
Got you, you son of a bitch.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.400
Boom. Got a hit.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.570
<i>Ooh, Luther Whitehead.</i>

19:02.590 --> 19:05.010
<i>Busted twice for possession
with intent.</i>

19:05.040 --> 19:08.100
Once on conspiracy.
Plead out on all three.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.480
Did a nickel up state
for a gun charge,

19:10.490 --> 19:13.390
and is currently on parole
for conspiracy to distribute.

19:13.410 --> 19:15.910
Something tells me his parole's
about to be revoked.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.490
- You got an address?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19:17.500 --> 19:19.160
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

19:40.890 --> 19:43.880
<i>On the ground! Get on the
ground! Hold it right there!</i>

19:43.880 --> 19:45.020
<i>Nobody move!</i>

19:46.240 --> 19:48.150
<i>Hands behind your back! Hands!</i>

20:00.520 --> 20:02.950
<i>Councillor, I have them dead to rights on weapons,</i>

20:02.970 --> 20:05.130
<i>possession, assault, desecration of a body,</i>

20:05.150 --> 20:08.950
and about a dozen other things
I haven't even begun to think about yet.

20:09.530 --> 20:11.660
What is my incentive to cut a deal?

20:12.070 --> 20:13.180
You don't have them on the murder.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.450
Give me time.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.980
You don't need time,
because they didn't do it.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.270
Ten years concurrent on all charges,

20:19.380 --> 20:20.760
<i>eligible in five,</i>

20:20.930 --> 20:22.840
<i>and they'll tell you everything they know.</i>

20:24.290 --> 20:25.480
He was coming to see you.

20:26.290 --> 20:27.830
At a flophouse on ninth.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.880
He was supposed to be there by 7:00.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.830
But this guy, he got three-quarters of a mil'
worth of our coke in his stomach,

20:33.860 --> 20:34.970
and he don't show.

20:35.010 --> 20:36.230
So what'd you do?

20:36.270 --> 20:37.320
We were gonna find him.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.020
That's when we heard the sirens.
Lots of them.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.860
We go downstairs, walk up the block.
And guess what we see?

20:43.320 --> 20:45.110
A bunch of cops staring at a tree.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.560
A fricking tree.
The dude was in a tree.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.400
So you waited?

20:49.430 --> 20:50.730
The only way to get the body back.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.740
Come,we couldn't get the packets
via the usual method.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.780
So you improvised?

20:56.050 --> 20:58.080
It doesn't matter.
He was already dead.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.250
So why did he start muling?

21:00.280 --> 21:02.270
Same as anyone,
desperation.

21:03.100 --> 21:03.910
<i>That's just...</i>

21:04.590 --> 21:05.930
He doesn't seem the type.

21:05.940 --> 21:08.050
Anybody's the type.
You push them hard enough.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.370
I mean, the guy owed.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.730
He was, uh, fourth and long
with the clock running out.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.020
Who was he into?

21:14.030 --> 21:16.080
Didn't say,
but he was scared.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.580
You want to know who killed him,
you find out who he owed.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.400
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna need more.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.980
I'm gonna need to know
who vouched.

21:23.010 --> 21:23.880
Vouched?

21:23.900 --> 21:26.720
For John Allen,
our vic, your mule.

21:26.730 --> 21:29.500
Somebody brought him to you,
somebody you trusted.

21:29.510 --> 21:31.610
Or do you just do business
with every desperate white boy

21:31.610 --> 21:33.290
with no history
of criminal activity?

21:33.810 --> 21:36.770
Hell, man. How did you know
he wasn't a cop?

21:39.820 --> 21:41.500
<i>Got the printout, Ron Bigby.</i>

21:41.510 --> 21:42.800
He's a floor trader at Goldman.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.580
Vic's wife never heard
the name.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.270
<i>For a guy who assesses risk for a living,</i>

21:46.280 --> 21:47.720
<i>he sure does seem to take a lot of them.</i>

21:47.730 --> 21:49.440
Yeah, well, look where
it got him.

21:49.490 --> 21:50.820
- Pick him up.
- You got it.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.480
<i>Castle.</i>

21:58.160 --> 21:59.610
- Dead?
- Yeah.

22:00.230 --> 22:00.950
Wait. Dead?

22:00.960 --> 22:03.020
Mr. Bigby, you can ask
as often as you like.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.410
The answer is not gonna change.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.880
Oh. That is a damn shame.
That is a damn, damn shame.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.300
I mean, do you know
who John Allen is? Huh?

22:11.380 --> 22:13.050
He's the new Willy Loman.
Okay?

22:13.120 --> 22:15.130
Every man victim
of an apathetic world.

22:15.490 --> 22:17.360
God, I swear.
Someone should write a play.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.110
- Hey, do you write plays?
- Unproduced.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.470
Mr. Bigby, it's come
to our attention

22:22.490 --> 22:26.140
that you recently obtained
employment for Mr. Allen as a drug mule.

22:28.790 --> 22:29.560
You know about that?

22:30.040 --> 22:30.440
Yeah.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.690
And bad news, Ron.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.030
You're gonna have to find
a new dealer.

22:34.750 --> 22:35.540
What'd they tell you?

22:35.570 --> 22:38.810
That you got him an introduction
and that you vouched for Mr. Allen.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.420
Okay, look.

22:39.430 --> 22:41.690
He--he came to me desperate,
all right?

22:41.720 --> 22:44.240
He--he remembered a story I told
one night at the table.

22:45.110 --> 22:45.760
The table?

22:45.790 --> 22:46.520
Yeah, poker table.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.520
We're in one of
the floating games around town.

22:48.580 --> 22:51.270
You know, small stakes, right?
But good way to blow off steam.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.990
But then when he got laid off,
it stopped being a game.

22:55.010 --> 22:57.230
He started betting
to make up his paycheck,

22:57.260 --> 22:58.420
But the stakes were too low.

22:58.450 --> 23:01.050
So he went to Chinatown.

23:01.970 --> 23:03.190
The mob-run games.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.710
Yeah, triads. He did fine
for a bit, you know?

23:05.720 --> 23:08.030
But...
Luck's a fickle bitch.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.020
He lost more than he had
to the wrong guy.

23:10.110 --> 23:11.970
He couldn't make enough
to cover his losses.

23:12.050 --> 23:13.680
Yeah, that's when he remembered
the night I told the story

23:13.710 --> 23:16.460
about my own fiscal emergency,
about how I went to Mexico,

23:16.470 --> 23:18.210
made 50 grand in one day.

23:19.110 --> 23:21.530
That's when I figured,
hey, what the hell?

23:21.540 --> 23:22.970
Just pay it forward.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.550
All right,
this guy that he owed--

23:24.580 --> 23:26.570
did he give you
a description, name?

23:26.610 --> 23:27.190
No name.

23:27.650 --> 23:30.740
John thought he was Russian mafia
because of all his tattoos.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.170
<i>If some tatted-up
Russian mobster was after me,</i>

23:34.210 --> 23:35.830
<i>I could see taking a job
as a drug mule.</i>

23:35.930 --> 23:37.930
<i>a tattooed Russian in New York city?</i>

23:38.130 --> 23:39.390
Well, that narrows it down.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.270
We conduct an investigation
based on the information we have,

23:42.280 --> 23:43.460
not the evidence we need.

23:43.570 --> 23:46.600
Well, Bigby says that
the Russian hangs out at the club at Chinatown.

23:46.820 --> 23:47.940
Why don't we just go there?

23:48.590 --> 23:50.620
The games are word of mouth, bro.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.290
They don't just share with cops.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.700
Well, luckily, I'm not a cop.

23:53.830 --> 23:55.590
- Castle.
<i>- What? It's perfect.</i>

23:55.870 --> 23:58.410
I go in, scope the place out
until I id the Russian.

23:58.650 --> 24:00.110
Hey, you know, that's not a bad plan.

24:01.590 --> 24:03.150
We still have to find the game.

24:03.770 --> 24:04.680
Leave that to me.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.700
<i>That's a pretty good story here, Ricky.</i>

24:06.900 --> 24:09.450
--has it got a big opening.
Major twist.

24:09.620 --> 24:12.460
Though I gotta say, I saw that
whole drug mule thing coming.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.400
Nice try, Connelly. You're not
gonna goad me into raising.

24:15.940 --> 24:19.470
Stephen, you once wrote about
an underground poker game in, uh, "King con".

24:20.240 --> 24:20.890
Yeah?

24:20.910 --> 24:24.010
And you once had Harry Bosch
investigate the murder of a poker player.

24:24.170 --> 24:25.920
Yeah, "One dollar jackpot". Why?

24:25.970 --> 24:28.650
Well, Michael, this guy
that we're looking for,

24:28.690 --> 24:31.000
he's a regular in the triad-run
games in Chinatown.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.720
I thought maybe one of you knew
someone who could get me in.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.000
What, are you nuts?

24:36.190 --> 24:38.200
Those are crooks
and killers down there.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.400
Look, Ricky, doing
the research is one thing,

24:40.400 --> 24:42.300
but the Russian mafia,
the Triad?

24:42.560 --> 24:43.810
You tangle with those people,

24:43.850 --> 24:46.200
and all the best sellers in the world
are not gonna protect you.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.500
Oh, no. I don't plan
on tangling.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.300
I'm just gonna be another
rich, bored thrill seeker

24:50.300 --> 24:51.700
looking to try my luck
down there.

24:53.110 --> 24:54.520
You must really like her.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.600
Who?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.200
That police detective of yours.
Look, Ricky,

24:58.800 --> 25:02.600
There's only one reason that you'd be
dumb enough to go down there,

25:02.600 --> 25:04.000
and that's to impress a girl.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.600
Why don't you
cut yourself a little slack.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.420
Come, just buy her
some flowers.

25:08.450 --> 25:09.900
Do you know the place or not?

25:12.900 --> 25:13.600
Well?

25:23.740 --> 25:25.200
Are you sure
this is the place?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.410
Cannel has never
steered me wrong.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.420
Okay.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.580
Button cam's
in place, ryan.

25:32.380 --> 25:34.590
Good for picture and...

25:34.670 --> 25:36.000
ah, sound.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.690
All right, so remember,

25:37.780 --> 25:40.200
we can hear you,
but you can't hear us.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.200
So once you leave this van,
you're on your own, okay?

25:43.670 --> 25:45.000
All right, tell me
the plan again.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.500
I go in, I find
the tattooed Russian,

25:48.500 --> 25:50.440
I get a clear picture of him,
and I get the hell out of there.

25:50.470 --> 25:52.800
And you don't stay
any longer than you need to.

25:52.820 --> 25:54.860
I'll be fine.
Besides, it's Chinatown.

25:54.870 --> 25:56.700
And how many Russian poker players
can there be?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.810
Anybody else have
a bad feeling about this?

26:12.710 --> 26:13.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

26:13.500 --> 26:14.350
that's what I thought.

27:16.390 --> 27:17.230
Go ahead and deal.

27:31.420 --> 27:32.290
I'm in.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.270
Tattooed Russian.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.430
<i>Uh, there's
another tattooed Russian.</i>

27:47.740 --> 27:51.380
<i>There's a whole table
of tattooed Russians.</i>

27:53.910 --> 27:59.350
Apparently there are a lot more Russians
in Chinatown than I thought.

28:07.690 --> 28:10.750
So... the Russians
are regulars here,

28:10.780 --> 28:13.010
but only a handful play
at the no-limit table,

28:13.030 --> 28:15.260
<i>which is where John Allen
would've gone.</i>

28:15.280 --> 28:18.420
<i>K' said they're
card bullies, pushing up pots,</i>

28:18.440 --> 28:20.860
<i>forcing their opponents to bet
more just to stay in the game.</i>

28:21.510 --> 28:24.100
<i>You think he has any idea
he's recapping a conversation</i>

28:24.120 --> 28:25.680
that we just heard
in its entirety?

28:25.750 --> 28:27.540
Give the guy a gadget,
he thinks he's Bond.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.460
Let's just hope he remembers
he's wearing a camera

28:29.480 --> 28:30.830
before he goes
and takes a leak.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.200
- Why would you even...
- Trust me.

28:32.220 --> 28:33.870
<i>...coming rough,
but I gotta stir it up.</i>

28:34.680 --> 28:35.930
I'm gonna go sit at the table,

28:36.460 --> 28:38.060
see if I can find
anything out.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.500
What did he say?

28:41.790 --> 28:43.730
- He just said he's taking a seat...
- That's not the plan.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.910
<i>That's not the plan, Castle!</i>

28:48.140 --> 28:48.970
How's it going?

28:50.130 --> 28:51.570
This is no-limit table.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.730
Which is perfect, because I am
a no-limit kinda guy.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.480
Change for $20,000, please.

29:00.610 --> 29:03.260
<i>no, no, no, no, no, no.
What's he doing?</i>

29:03.330 --> 29:05.790
Dropping half my yearly salary
like it was pocket change.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.820
Nice tats.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.770
Ta--no, tattoos.
The tat--it's nice.

29:17.940 --> 29:19.060
What do they say?

29:19.690 --> 29:21.420
It says mind your own business

29:21.430 --> 29:22.490
and play cards.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.470
All right, don't mean to pry.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.010
I'm just, uh, I'm actually
just a writer.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.600
I'm just doing
a little bit of research.

29:29.810 --> 29:30.720
<i>Writer, huh?</i>

29:31.850 --> 29:33.690
Anything, uh,
we might have heard of?

29:34.700 --> 29:37.520
Uh, "Storm fall",
"Storm's last stand".

29:37.540 --> 29:39.060
- Derrick Storm.
- Yeah.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.040
I love this guy.

29:40.410 --> 29:41.950
Why did you kill him?

29:42.470 --> 29:43.410
It's a long story,

29:43.440 --> 29:46.130
but I'm working on a new one,
about, uh, underground poker.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.350
<i>Very hush-hush.</i>

29:47.360 --> 29:49.540
<i>Just kinda came down to get
a feel for the world, you know?</i>

29:50.270 --> 29:52.650
And you're--you want to try
to be authentic?

29:52.660 --> 29:53.760
Exactly.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.860
No problem.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.160
Yeah.

30:08.290 --> 30:09.700
<i>Seems like he's making friends.</i>

30:09.800 --> 30:11.680
They just said they're gonna take him
for everything he's got.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.350
What, you speak Russian?

30:14.050 --> 30:16.150
Semester in Kiev,
between junior and senior year.

30:17.420 --> 30:18.590
Sometimes when I am bored,

30:18.600 --> 30:22.150
I got to Glechik cafe in little Odessa
and pretend to be Muscovite.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.240
Now that's kinda hot.

30:26.960 --> 30:27.680
Raise.

30:30.180 --> 30:30.880
Call.

30:32.380 --> 30:33.140
I call.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.810
Check the player's hands.

30:45.820 --> 30:48.870
See if there's anything that'll explain
the bruise patterns on our vic's neck.

30:52.900 --> 30:53.510
Call.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.580
Say, Mr. Castle,

30:57.310 --> 30:59.250
Tell me little bit more
about this book.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.120
Well, it's about
a, uh, Russian mobster

31:02.460 --> 31:04.060
with a taste for cards.

31:04.970 --> 31:06.030
He, uh,

31:07.020 --> 31:08.610
preys off of desperation,

31:08.630 --> 31:11.530
luring people in to bet him
more than they have.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.420
And why would he do this?

31:20.030 --> 31:21.570
Because he's also a loan shark.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.210
<i>See, he fronts his victims,
and makes bank on the vic...</i>

31:26.230 --> 31:27.200
What the hell is he doing?

31:27.210 --> 31:29.320
He's playing poker.
He's trying to provoke

31:29.340 --> 31:30.900
one of these guys
into giving up their hand.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.190
- Or he's trying to tip off our killer.
<i>- but there's one guy,</i>

31:33.320 --> 31:36.490
a family guy, he gets in
a little too deep,

31:37.110 --> 31:38.270
can't pay the loan back.

31:39.500 --> 31:42.930
<i>So the mobster... got no choice.</i>

31:42.970 --> 31:44.110
<i>Has to kill him,</i>

31:44.780 --> 31:46.790
send a message
to anyone else who owes him.

31:47.880 --> 31:48.790
So one night...

31:50.010 --> 31:51.980
he lures him
into an abandoned building,

31:53.050 --> 31:55.190
strangles him to death
and throws him off the roof.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.730
Sounds like lot of work.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.080
Why not just put bullet In his head?

32:02.180 --> 32:03.340
<i>It's much more simple.</i>

32:03.970 --> 32:04.840
Bang!

32:09.450 --> 32:10.740
Hey, Ryan,
check this out.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.270
<i>What is he doing with his finger?</i>

32:12.360 --> 32:13.260
<i>Punch in on that.</i>

32:16.280 --> 32:17.660
It's a prosthetic.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.010
That's why it didn't leave
a mark on our vic.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.360
<i>That's our guy.</i>

32:21.370 --> 32:24.070
- Hey, if he thinks Castle's a threat, he's--
- We gotta get him out of there now.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.370
Their security's pretty well armed.

32:25.390 --> 32:26.910
We go in there as cops,
it might get messy.

32:26.920 --> 32:27.720
Oh, what are you doing?

32:27.740 --> 32:29.150
Uh, I'm gonna go in there,

32:29.180 --> 32:30.340
And if I'm not out in 10 minutes,

32:30.360 --> 32:32.100
You guys call for backup.
Can I have my purse, please?

32:34.050 --> 32:35.780
What are you gonna do?
Lip gloss them to death?

32:35.850 --> 32:36.870
Something like that.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.330
Oh, come on, boys.

33:35.610 --> 33:38.010
My boyfriend is waiting.
He is player.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.010
If I don't go inside, he will lose.

33:40.430 --> 33:42.260
I'm his lucky charm, you know?

33:43.580 --> 33:44.450
No?

33:45.910 --> 33:49.410
Well, maybe I can be
a lucky charm for you.

33:50.370 --> 33:53.290
We win, and when I am in there,
we always win,

33:53.420 --> 33:57.940
and then maybe I can share
some of my boyfriend's luck with you.

33:58.630 --> 33:59.430
Hmm.

34:03.890 --> 34:04.900
All in.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.909
It's a big pot,
Mr. writer man...

34:10.070 --> 34:11.570
All that money.

34:12.489 --> 34:14.690
But then, what is money
to millionaire, huh?

34:14.699 --> 34:16.590
You just can write it off on your taxes,

34:16.600 --> 34:18.940
<i>uh, as, uh, doing research.</i>

34:21.150 --> 34:22.159
All in.

34:26.100 --> 34:28.230
You are like character in your book...

34:28.830 --> 34:30.270
in too deep.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.710
Three queens.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.659
That's very impressive.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.550
Not a lot can beat three queens.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.750
Except an inside straight,
Maybe.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.100
Sweetheart, this is for you.

34:47.110 --> 34:50.120
Would you change this into something
a little smaller that I can carry?

34:50.150 --> 34:52.090
Now that is a big pile of money.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.570
But what's money to a mobster, right?

35:01.540 --> 35:02.680
Walk.

35:05.230 --> 35:05.980
Who are you?

35:06.010 --> 35:07.390
I told you,I'm--I'm a novelist.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.190
The story--the dead man, the roof.
Who told you?

35:09.230 --> 35:11.330
Who knows?
--think his family know, his children know.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.440
If he paid what he owed,
he'd be home with them now.

35:13.470 --> 35:16.110
But he crossed me.
And now you have crossed me.

35:16.150 --> 35:17.660
No, no, no,
I'm just a writer.

35:17.670 --> 35:21.540
- Do not lie. You're a cop.
- Him, a cop?

35:22.600 --> 35:25.840
Don't make me laugh.
He's barely even a man.

35:26.410 --> 35:27.000
Beckett?

35:27.030 --> 35:29.350
But you are a man, aren't you?

35:29.370 --> 35:31.210
A very handsome man.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.580
Richard, are you bothering
this handsome man?

35:34.780 --> 35:35.660
Go away.

35:37.450 --> 35:40.450
Okay, boys and their guns.
Am I supposed to be impressed?

35:40.460 --> 35:43.220
- It doesn't concern you.
- Actually...

35:44.600 --> 35:45.960
it does.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.080
Is it just my imagination,
or did you change?

35:50.100 --> 35:52.360
Castle, could you get
some backup, please?

35:52.380 --> 35:53.920
- Yeah.
- Shh, shh, shh.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.630
- Yeah...    yeah...
- ... Thank you

36:13.430 --> 36:14.490
So how is she?

36:17.080 --> 36:21.110
It's hard when everything you thought
you knew turns out to be a lie.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.460
Well, not everything was a lie.

36:24.410 --> 36:25.620
Not her husband's love.

36:25.630 --> 36:26.980
I mean, sometimes

36:27.640 --> 36:29.520
we do the wrong things for the right reasons.

36:32.430 --> 36:33.640
So case is closed.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.190
So I guess your "Cosmo" story gets a happy ending.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.200
Speaking of happy endings...

36:39.650 --> 36:41.030
Thanks for saving my life.

36:41.210 --> 36:43.220
I was just trying
to avoid paperwork.

36:43.230 --> 36:45.550
Ah. We make
a pretty good team, you know?

36:46.220 --> 36:47.440
Like Starsky and Hutch,

36:47.690 --> 36:48.980
Tango and Cash,

36:49.730 --> 36:50.900
Turner and Hooch.

36:51.780 --> 36:52.810
You know, now that you mention it,

36:52.820 --> 36:54.550
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.080
It's because you're afraid,
isn't it?

37:02.690 --> 37:05.300
You're afraid that if you look
into your mother's death,

37:05.300 --> 37:07.170
That you will go back down
that rabbit hole

37:07.170 --> 37:08.300
And lose yourself again.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.260
But it's different this time.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.110
We have good leads.

37:14.140 --> 37:16.350
We have strong leads.

37:17.270 --> 37:19.230
And you won't
have to do it alone.

37:21.010 --> 37:22.350
We can do it together.

37:24.230 --> 37:25.550
What if I don't want to know?

37:26.330 --> 37:27.870
Did you ever think of that?

37:31.470 --> 37:32.460
What if I'm not ready?

37:32.470 --> 37:34.370
What if the idea of catching
my mom's murderer

37:34.390 --> 37:37.380
and then having to sit there
and watch as he cuts some deal

37:37.380 --> 37:39.680
that puts him back out
on the street in ten years

37:39.690 --> 37:41.070
makes me nauseous?

37:41.840 --> 37:45.220
You dredged up my past
for you, Castle, not for me.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.430
And you're too selfish
to even see it.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.930
The case is closed, Castle.

37:53.190 --> 37:56.120
We made a deal,
and I expect you to honour it.

38:33.880 --> 38:34.860
You're writing.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.450
It's time.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.740
And Beckett?

38:45.780 --> 38:47.220
I'm sorry, dad.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.460
So how was the movie?

38:50.790 --> 38:51.790
We didn't go.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.000
- Why not?
- Owen.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.000
What happened?

38:57.330 --> 38:59.470
He was playing video games
and lost track of time.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.960
By the time he showed up,
it was too late.

39:05.570 --> 39:06.660
Sorry, sweetie.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.070
And then when he did show up,

39:08.100 --> 39:09.880
he tried to act like it's no big deal,

39:09.940 --> 39:11.500
like I'm overreacting.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.030
I mean, he didn't even call.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.410
Why do boys do that?

39:17.790 --> 39:20.500
Why do they always have to
justify everything?

39:22.310 --> 39:23.860
Why can't they just say they're sorry?

39:35.260 --> 39:36.150
Thank you.

39:37.470 --> 39:38.220
For what?

39:38.840 --> 39:41.380
For just... being you.

39:58.910 --> 40:02.270
<i>* You gave me good steps to follow *</i>

40:02.280 --> 40:04.560
<i>* and I wish I... *</i>

40:04.880 --> 40:05.720
I'm sorry.

40:07.610 --> 40:08.700
What I did was wrong.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.280
<i>I violated your trust,
I opened old wounds,</i>

40:13.300 --> 40:15.480
<i>and I did not respect your wishes.</i>

40:17.870 --> 40:19.340
And if we're not gonna see each other again,

40:19.340 --> 40:20.540
then you deserve to know...

40:20.550 --> 40:23.280
<i>* and I'm sorry that I... *</i>

40:23.280 --> 40:25.500
I'm very, very sorry.

40:26.300 --> 40:29.310
<i>* but your little girl *</i>

40:30.450 --> 40:35.450
<i>* is gonna change the world *</i>

40:35.770 --> 40:39.150
<i>* you'll see *</i>

40:39.160 --> 40:40.000
Castle.

40:44.350 --> 40:45.460
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.460
<i>* you'll see *</i>

40:54.050 --> 40:54.750
