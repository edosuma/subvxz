02:58.762 --> 02:59.971
Are you Inga of Varteig?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.640
Yes.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.434
We are Birkebeinerne.
Is that Håkon Håkonsson?

03:06.144 --> 03:07.186
Yes.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.939
You must come with us.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.318
The King sends his greetings.
Come on.

03:15.946 --> 03:16.988
It's all right, Håkon.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.594
- Is he okay?
- Yes.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.554
Hi.

05:06.056 --> 05:11.310
We will soon be there,
and you will both be safe.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.396
Good.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.032
- Be careful.
- Huh?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.034
She has borne a child by the King,
Torstein.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.372
I am just looking out for the child,
Skjervald. The child.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.376
Now we must part, my friend.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.670
Are you sure about this?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.172
Yes, I know that the King's son
is in good hands.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.927
Do you... do you know
how to milk a cow?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.304
No. But Ylva does.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.976
If you change your mind,
you know where we are.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.437
- Get home safely.
- Thanks.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.650
Take care of the child, now.
The child!

06:01.153 --> 06:03.571
You will never be a farmer,
Skjervald!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.995
- Who is there?
- It is I...

06:54.331 --> 06:55.372
Skjervald.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.464
There you are, finally.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.343
Yes, had to go all the way to Borg...

07:08.261 --> 07:09.595
So...

07:10.722 --> 07:12.389
You are long overdue.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.267
Yes, it took longer than I expected.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.604
But, this was my final mission.
I promise, Ylva.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.773
You said that you would
finish the house

07:21.149 --> 07:22.983
and that the barn would be
finished by winter.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.611
I know. And it will be finished.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.947
By next winter, perhaps?

07:28.907 --> 07:30.032
By summer.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.078
Summer? Do you promise?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.124
I promise, Ylva.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.044
No more Birkebeinerne.

07:42.796 --> 07:47.383
I will stay here, with you and Eirik.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.471
I promise.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.480
Is he asleep?

08:08.613 --> 08:09.822
No, you're wide awake.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.286
Come, my boy.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.456
There, look.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.210
And there.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.174
Hi.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.010
Oh, no.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.013
Come, now.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.270
- Oh!
- Oh.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.690
Oh.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.873
Only you can get close enough to him.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.376
Therefore, you must be the one
to do it.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.171
For God's sake, Gisle,
Håkon is my stepson!

09:49.339 --> 09:51.966
He is the King, Margaret.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.761
He's too young to understand that the
time of the Birkebeinerne is past.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.180
The Baglers are going to
win this war,

09:58.974 --> 10:00.516
and that is an opportunity
I intend to exploit.

10:05.146 --> 10:09.400
Meet him alone.
He trusts you. It will be fine.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.034
What if something... what if things
don't go as we have planned?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.663
Of course things will go
as we have planned.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.665
Everyone will believe
that it was Inge.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.960
With him being first in line to
the throne, no one will suspect us.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.175
Here.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.930
Soon you will be queen again.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.551
Mother?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.890
You can't go through with it.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.769
What?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.103
I heard what he said.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.319
You heard nothing.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.575
Do you understand me? Nothing.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.746
Can you promise me that?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.000
If this becomes known...

11:52.712 --> 11:53.921
...we die.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.886
My dear, dear daughter.
Forgive me. Forgive me.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.894
I must return to Sweden.
But, when we meet again,

12:09.270 --> 12:11.647
it will be when I marry
in Nidaros Cathedral

12:12.065 --> 12:13.399
and become queen once again.

12:14.651 --> 12:19.113
And you...
you will be my... princess.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.325
I know it is an arduous task.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.953
You have a long journey ahead of you.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.916
But, Sweden is important to us,
and only you can win their trust.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.338
You must persuade them to break with
the Church and support us

12:36.506 --> 12:38.006
in our fight against the Baglers.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.306
My father sees us, Margaret.
Let us make him proud.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.275
Cheers, my friend.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.487
For Norway.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.784
I want to thank you, Margaret.

13:07.662 --> 13:11.874
You stood loyally at my father's side
for as long as he lived.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.420
I have seen your sorrow
since father died,

13:17.755 --> 13:20.215
and I know that you miss him
as much as I do.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.437
I have lost all those closest to me.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.067
I now only have you and Kristin.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.199
For all your affection, cheers.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.471
Farewell, my son.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.099
Farewell, Margaret.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.583
Get... get Inge Bårdsson!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.967
Gisle, where is Inge?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.391
Inge!

14:54.185 --> 14:58.522
In Borg, I shared my bed with
a woman, Inga of Varteig.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.734
She bore my son, Håkon Håkonsson.
He shall inherit the throne.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.697
Birkebeinerne in Eastern Norway
are bringing him north.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.783
Meet them in Østerdalen with an army!

15:56.914 --> 15:58.540
We have a traitor among us.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.086
Here, in this room.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.507
Queen Dowager Margaret poisoned
the King, but she did not act alone.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.093
She was just a pawn in a game.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.057
Our traitor might believe that Rome
has won the battle for Norway...

16:15.475 --> 16:17.559
and that he will avoid being punished
for his sins,

16:17.727 --> 16:19.811
but believe me, Birkebeinerne...

16:21.981 --> 16:23.148
I shall find him.

16:24.067 --> 16:27.069
No one leaves, the gate is locked.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.321
Of course, we will send an army south
as soon as possible

16:29.489 --> 16:30.781
to find the King's son.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.533
No one leaves the royal residence
until the traitor is caught!

16:44.712 --> 16:48.173
Eh, my brother is under
intense pressure.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.969
Unless he perhaps sees an opportunity
to make himself King?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.179
What do you mean by that?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.306
Inge is quick to accuse us,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.601
the King's closest allies
as well as his own brother.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.939
Gisle and Inge are not
the sons of kings.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.441
Yet, if Sverre's bloodline
dies off with Håkon Håkonsson,

17:06.608 --> 17:08.484
one of them will inherit the throne.

17:09.404 --> 17:13.115
And Inge is eldest.
Inge is first in line of ascension.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.742
Inge Bårdsson stands to gain
most from the King's death.

17:18.913 --> 17:22.040
So he accuses us,
loyal Birkebeinerne

17:22.208 --> 17:24.876
who have served Norwegian kings
since before he was born.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.588
It is not Inge, it is Håkon Håkonsson

17:28.756 --> 17:32.050
who is the heir to Norway's throne,
and the boy's life is in danger.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.761
If the King's son dies, we will
become a dependency under Denmark.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.430
The pope will rule over us.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.644
What will you do, Gisle?

17:46.315 --> 17:48.775
Anyone who attempts to leave,
shall be locked up.

17:48.943 --> 17:49.943
Ravn...

17:51.154 --> 17:53.530
...gather your men
and bring the king's son here.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.205
A Birkebeiner from Nidaros.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.103
It is from Earl Gisle.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.873
We have just received the news
from Nidaros.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.418
King Håkon is dead.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.550
The Birkebeinerne have lost
their unifying force.

19:37.677 --> 19:42.472
The time of kings is past.
But, the Church will always endure.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.142
When one man falls,
another will take his place.

19:46.561 --> 19:49.521
And he answers only to God.

19:51.649 --> 19:55.944
We rule Eastern Norway.
Western Norway is next.

19:57.405 --> 20:01.908
Soon the Church will have dominion
over all of Norway.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.579
But one task remains.

20:13.421 --> 20:17.257
King Håkon is survived by a son.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.012
Today, an innocent boy.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.725
Tomorrow... our mightiest foe.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.396
The boy is being hidden on a farm
here in our territory.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.441
The man who finds the King's son,

20:34.609 --> 20:36.943
shall enjoy great wealth
all of his days.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.363
Show no mercy during your hunt
for the child,

20:40.656 --> 20:44.743
for the Lord is eternally merciful,
but He also requires sacrifices.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.746
Let law and order yield
along the way...

20:50.583 --> 20:52.250
...and bring me the boy's head.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.242
Now, now, Eirik, it's okay.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.706
It's okay. Hush, hush, hush.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.282
That is one tough wife you have.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.743
Really tough.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.414
What have you done with Ylva?

22:55.041 --> 22:58.877
All is well.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.462
Hush.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.048
Ylva?

23:03.549 --> 23:04.549
Ylva!

23:04.759 --> 23:06.301
Skjervald, we are here.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.849
There is a boy of royal blood.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.185
Where are they hiding the boy?

23:18.189 --> 23:19.939
I don't know
what you are talking about.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.862
Do you care so little for your family

23:26.363 --> 23:29.741
that you would sacrifice their lives
for a dead king?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.170
- Get it over with.
- Skjervald!

23:42.338 --> 23:43.922
No, wait! wait!

23:48.511 --> 23:50.053
The King's son is in Borg.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.306
He was in Borg.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.936
You and Torstein took him away.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.271
I saw you.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.653
Just tell us where the boy is, and he
will let Ylva and your son live.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.034
The King is dead, Skjervald.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.663
Tell us where the boy is.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.922
Okay, I will show you the way.
I will come with you.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.341
Which direction?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.761
North.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.013
Where?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.518
Where the Lågen flows
into Lake Mjøsa.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.522
I know the place.
I can take you there.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.315
Damn traitor!

24:54.118 --> 24:55.743
So easily you crack.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.955
There is no fight in you.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.168
Your wife did not say a word.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.674
No matter what we did to her.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.145
Get him out!

26:37.429 --> 26:38.721
Get him!

26:58.242 --> 26:59.575
So, where is the boy?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.066
Can I have that?

27:33.402 --> 27:37.322
Thanks.

27:46.623 --> 27:51.210
Hey, Håkon Håkonsson,
now you must get some sleep.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.099
Are you hungry?

28:07.061 --> 28:08.394
No, thanks.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.105
Are you sure?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.567
Yes, I can take one.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.405
You know that if you give me
your little finger,

28:19.573 --> 28:20.865
I might take your whole hand.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.007
- Can I give it a try?
- Yes, sure.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.676
No, no.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.471
- Huh?
- Hold it like that.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.849
If a Bagler approaches you,
do like this!

28:49.436 --> 28:50.436
Okay.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.690
Like that. Good.
Right, bend your knees.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.401
Bend your knees. Down in...

29:00.697 --> 29:02.824
You know, Egil,
when your father was young,

29:02.991 --> 29:05.034
he was one of our fiercest warriors.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.828
Was he a Birkebeiner?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.621
Have you never told him?

29:11.917 --> 29:15.837
Honor be to the Birkebeinerne
and all that you are fighting for.

29:18.048 --> 29:21.467
But, being a farmer
and putting food on the table...

29:22.845 --> 29:24.637
...is the best thing a man can do.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.349
Your boy will become a Birkebeiner,
wait and see.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.624
Trym, you can go.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.430
Your father has been through hell,
Egil. Many of us have.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.891
But, we are free men.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.018
So keep your eyes open.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.478
I will.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.316
- And your ears.
- Yes.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.839
Someone is coming!
Torstein, someone is coming.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.470
- Where?
- Look there.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.308
The gate!

30:53.727 --> 30:54.810
You stay here!

31:02.402 --> 31:04.820
The Baglers are coming.
Get the King's son away!

31:05.113 --> 31:07.114
Prepare the men and fetch Erlend.
Now!

31:13.288 --> 31:15.790
Skjervald. What happened?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.000
What has happened?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.044
Ylva.

31:20.754 --> 31:21.754
Come.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.599
The horse is ready.
Get more food, Egil.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.934
Yes.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.686
We have to get the boy out of here.

31:36.853 --> 31:41.065
We stay together until Audun's farm,
and then we'll take Østerdalen.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.568
You go ahead and leave.
I will stay here.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.825
Erlend, we are ready to leave.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.120
Where did you see the Baglers?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.414
They can be here at any moment.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.000
- Where?
- They attacked my farm.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.002
How many?

32:01.169 --> 32:02.420
About 12 men.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.464
Only 12?

32:05.757 --> 32:08.301
One of our men is with them.
A Birkebeiner.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.346
Ståle. Yes, might be more of them.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.058
We must get Håkon away from here
before it is too late.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.685
I will stay here
and delay the Baglers.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.062
The boy is safe.
We have guards and scouts everywhere.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.357
No, we head north now.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.484
The boy stays.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.112
By order of the King.

32:30.741 --> 32:31.907
The King is dead.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.466
The Baglers know that Håkon is here.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.139
And how the hell do they know that?

33:00.979 --> 33:02.188
I told them.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.154
We are leaving.

33:10.781 --> 33:17.036
But first, you'll see what we do with
those who betray our righteous cause.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.457
Skjervald.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.800
Brothers!

33:33.595 --> 33:37.640
Our cause and our blood
have always met resistance.

33:39.351 --> 33:43.354
Shoulder to shoulder, we have fought
and bled for each other.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.274
- Gard?
- But, what happened?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.902
Torstein, we're leaving.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.029
Someone has betrayed us.

33:53.699 --> 33:54.949
We...

33:56.034 --> 33:57.827
...who drink together.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.915
Skjervald,
you have betrayed your King.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.333
Wait!

34:06.086 --> 34:08.462
Skjervald is one of us.

34:10.424 --> 34:11.424
He always has been.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.929
Show that you are loyal to your King.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.686
Do it, Torstein, and get
the King's son away from here.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.150
No...

34:31.737 --> 34:32.902
I...

34:34.156 --> 34:35.197
...refuse.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.077
Then you will be next.

34:42.164 --> 34:46.083
We must show no mercy.

34:47.585 --> 34:52.214
You will see what befalls those
who betray us!

34:52.716 --> 34:55.176
We shall defend our right.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.724
Baglers!

35:01.975 --> 35:03.309
Attack!

35:14.780 --> 35:16.280
Get to the sleigh, and flee!

35:33.465 --> 35:34.507
No!

35:42.057 --> 35:43.933
Hush! Hush!

35:45.811 --> 35:47.102
Run!

35:49.022 --> 35:51.273
Take the quickest route to
Østerdalen. I will take the boy.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.275
- No!
- Traitor!

35:56.363 --> 35:58.364
Inga! Listen!

35:58.698 --> 36:01.700
We will take care of him.
You have my word.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.119
Hurry. Get away from here!

36:09.876 --> 36:11.085
Torstein!

36:43.326 --> 36:44.785
To the horses!

36:54.087 --> 36:57.298
Baglers! Hurry! Hurry!

37:07.559 --> 37:08.767
Hurry.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.061
In here. This way.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.010
Let them choose.

37:44.387 --> 37:48.766
Fight on our side, or die.

37:49.517 --> 37:54.605
Your word is my command, Lord.

38:00.737 --> 38:04.490
Those who want to live,
must fight for the Church.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.284
The choice is yours.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.030
Skjervald! We shook them off.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.574
He's sleeping.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.743
He's sleeping?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.246
Help me get him on my back.

39:02.716 --> 39:04.258
Good. Let's go.

39:25.572 --> 39:26.697
Gisle.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.409
Let me out of here!

39:34.831 --> 39:36.457
You will not manage this alone.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.792
Not without me.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.297
It appears that you were mistaken
about me, Inge.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.426
A long time.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.015
I know that you did not
kill the King.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.185
Because I am the one who did.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.980
And I just want you to know that...

40:02.734 --> 40:04.818
...King Sverre's bloodline...

40:06.821 --> 40:08.072
...ends here.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.457
Forgive me, brother.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.502
I never gave you a chance.

40:23.046 --> 40:26.256
I have always stood in the way of
things you wanted to achieve.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.634
But, now your turn has come.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.887
Show the goodness in your heart.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.060
Save the King's son.

40:54.702 --> 40:58.247
You have never known me, brother.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.917
You have no idea who I am.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.544
Do you sleep here too?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.212
No.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.265
Kristin?

42:00.268 --> 42:03.270
Has anyone been here
in the night recently?

42:08.610 --> 42:09.610
Well?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.280
Kristin?

42:15.450 --> 42:16.950
I did not see anyone.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.765
Kristin?

42:42.435 --> 42:45.520
I know that this is very difficult.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.901
But, you must trust me alone.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.698
Do not speak to anyone, do nothing.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.118
I am the only one who can protect you
now, do you understand?

43:01.579 --> 43:04.998
Yes.

43:23.309 --> 43:24.643
Torstein?

43:26.271 --> 43:27.562
How is he doing?

43:35.780 --> 43:37.281
He is doing just fine.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.834
- Shall we keep going?
- We must keep going.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.211
We must get him to Audun's farm
before it gets dark.

43:51.379 --> 43:52.587
Yes.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.743
It's going to be alright.
It will be fine, Egil.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.938
- Is there something wrong with him?
- What?

44:52.106 --> 44:55.484
He's screaming!
He's going to freeze to death!

44:58.029 --> 45:00.655
He's fine. Look here. See.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.285
We must find shelter!

45:05.453 --> 45:07.662
There are some little barns
over there.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.149
Torstein!

45:37.318 --> 45:38.318
Look!

46:07.932 --> 46:09.182
He is freezing.

46:09.684 --> 46:15.564
Take him out. We are safe here
as long as the storm holds.

46:19.527 --> 46:20.777
Here.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.704
Hush, hush. Look here. Look.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.583
His hands are warm.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.751
He has royal blood.

46:39.172 --> 46:41.298
He is a tough little guy.

46:41.716 --> 46:42.883
Yes.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.761
Do we have any food?

46:47.305 --> 46:48.388
No.

46:50.850 --> 46:54.144
Now, now, now. So, so, so...

47:12.914 --> 47:16.416
Håkon, Håkon.
Look at this. Look!

47:19.545 --> 47:21.213
Look here.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.549
Look.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.426
Look here.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.096
Look here, Håkon. Look.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.435
Watch it go! Look.

47:36.729 --> 47:39.105
Look here. Clippity-clop.

47:40.149 --> 47:43.235
Once upon a time,
there was a little...

47:44.195 --> 47:45.529
...King's horse.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.822
No, an ordinary horse.

47:48.950 --> 47:52.202
And that horse, it...
wanted to be king.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.789
Håkon. But, in order to do so,

47:55.957 --> 47:59.709
it had to ride through
a mountain of flames.

48:00.586 --> 48:04.256
But, it was too hot.
So he kept having to stop.

48:05.841 --> 48:09.844
But one day...
he found the fire within himself.

48:11.847 --> 48:17.352
And he rode right through the flames.
Ouch!

48:19.355 --> 48:23.400
And that is why he came
all the way here to you...

48:24.694 --> 48:25.986
Yes.

48:31.993 --> 48:33.493
The King's horse.

48:36.330 --> 48:37.581
Oh, look...

48:41.085 --> 48:44.713
Look here, Håkon, have some water.

48:45.548 --> 48:48.758
Do you want some water?

48:50.428 --> 48:52.262
Look. There.

49:06.319 --> 49:07.736
Good.

49:12.199 --> 49:14.534
Give me the horse. Look.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.042
Torstein.

50:05.086 --> 50:07.462
Torstein, I must leave.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.339
What?

50:10.174 --> 50:13.677
We're close to Audun's farm.
He will help you on your way.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.388
The Baglers won't be expecting me
in the storm.

50:16.555 --> 50:18.598
I will take them by surprise.

50:19.642 --> 50:23.186
Are you leaving me here with
the King's son up in the mountains

50:23.354 --> 50:24.979
in a damn blizzard?

50:26.107 --> 50:27.899
I don't know how to care for the boy!

50:28.067 --> 50:30.735
Torstein, I must do this.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.281
We are doing this together,
damn it!

50:36.701 --> 50:38.451
Norway's future is lying there,

50:38.619 --> 50:40.578
and it's your fault
that we're even here.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.038
- My fault?
- Yes, yours.

50:42.206 --> 50:43.206
- My fault?
- Yes.

50:47.211 --> 50:50.171
Ylva said nothing. Nothing.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.007
Do you understand?

50:53.676 --> 50:55.760
Do you know how strong
she must have been?

50:57.513 --> 50:59.097
She fought until the end.

51:00.266 --> 51:01.599
And what did I do?

51:06.981 --> 51:08.314
Skjervald.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.109
I must kill him.

51:15.448 --> 51:21.077
You'll have your revenge, Skjervald.
It is your right and your duty.

51:23.038 --> 51:26.291
But it won't help that defenseless
little boy lying there.

51:33.174 --> 51:38.762
This is the only thing
that proves that Håkon

51:39.221 --> 51:40.597
is our new king.

51:44.226 --> 51:46.227
And now I am giving it to you.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.148
Here.

51:54.570 --> 51:59.699
We will all die, Skjervald.
But our legacy lives on.

52:20.679 --> 52:24.265
There are rumors that King Håkon
is survived by a son.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.936
The rumors are true.

52:31.315 --> 52:37.070
We've done everything in our power to
bring the royal heir here to Nidaros.

52:39.865 --> 52:40.907
But...

52:43.953 --> 52:46.496
...as we all know,
the winter can be merciless.

52:48.582 --> 52:52.126
And it saddens me
to have to inform you...

52:53.921 --> 52:56.840
...that the boy died in a storm
in the mountains.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.510
The King's son is dead.

53:02.680 --> 53:08.393
It is with great humility
that I have accepted the task...

53:10.563 --> 53:12.272
...of being Norway's new king.

53:15.818 --> 53:18.111
To secure an heir to the throne,

53:18.696 --> 53:22.323
I will marry King Sverre's daughter,
Kristin.

53:29.623 --> 53:33.334
Together we will ensure
that there is peace in our land.

53:34.795 --> 53:37.672
Those who were once our enemies,
shall become our friends.

53:38.299 --> 53:40.008
Swords shall be laid down,

53:41.176 --> 53:44.178
and disputes with the Church
shall be forever laid to rest.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.599
You will see a new Norway.

54:16.879 --> 54:20.173
Torstein, Torstein.
The storm has calmed.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.717
Take Håkon.

54:50.162 --> 54:54.332
Torstein! Torstein!
They're here.

55:00.506 --> 55:03.967
They've seen us.
So, so, so, so.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.346
Come on!

57:03.629 --> 57:06.005
Catch them, damn you!

57:15.057 --> 57:17.725
Skjervald!
Watch out ahead!

57:25.609 --> 57:27.610
Torstein! Is he okay?

57:27.861 --> 57:30.154
He's alive! So. Let's go!

57:31.031 --> 57:32.365
Onward!

57:36.662 --> 57:38.079
More are coming!

57:38.956 --> 57:41.666
Keep going.
I'll take care of them.

58:00.435 --> 58:01.644
No.

58:16.702 --> 58:20.454
Torstein!

58:47.065 --> 58:48.566
Torstein!
Are you okay?

58:48.734 --> 58:50.151
No, damn it!

58:50.319 --> 58:52.320
- Give me the child.
- No, we must continue!

58:56.742 --> 58:58.034
Come on. Hurry!

59:20.182 --> 59:21.390
Inga!

59:23.644 --> 59:26.646
Welcome to our farm.
Did you have a baby?

59:29.066 --> 59:32.109
Oh, my son! You're alive!

59:34.196 --> 59:35.446
My boy.

59:37.324 --> 59:38.658
Thank you, Torstein.

59:40.118 --> 59:42.411
Now, now. Mama is here.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.163
Torstein!

59:44.873 --> 59:48.459
Torstein! Get him inside,
we must take out the arrow.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.007
Ready?

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.639
- Easy. Easy, now.
- Give me that bottle.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.561
No, not that, it's fish oil.
The one next to it.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:12.817
Take it easy. I've done this before.
To reindeer.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:16.153
Stay here. Stay. Stay.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.452
All that... doesn't help a bit.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.960
If I die, I'm going to kill you.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.336
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.717
Frikk, hold him down.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:41.595
- Are you ready?
- No!

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.239
It will be fine.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.839
I'll take that.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.508
No, not a chance.
Remember what happened last time.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.683
We must gather an army, Audun.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.519
We must get Håkon to Nidaros.

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:35.983
An army? Could you go and fetch
an army, Frikk?

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:40.071
All you will find here,
is ordinary folk.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:45.910
Hunters, farmers, crofters
and an occasional fair maiden,

01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:47.995
- if you're lucky.
- We need warriors, Audun.

01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:50.373
Send word for the King's men.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.545
The King, yes.
Well, he did not last long.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.216
Fenrir the Wolf is loose.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:02.968
Rumor is that Nidaros
is out of control.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.929
No one knows who is in power.

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:09.433
It might be us.
It might be the Baglers.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.276
Done. Let's take him to the sauna.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.143
I know how you're feeling.

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:55.855
I have also lost my family.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:15.708
Egil?

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.880
- Can I count on you?
- Yes.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:22.256
Good.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.468
- Go up on that mountain.
- Up there?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.888
Yes. And then find a spot
with a good view to the south.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.931
- Okay.
- Keep a constant lookout.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.017
- Yes.
- Don't sleep while standing guard.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:35.478
- Don't be afraid. Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:38.063
If you see anyone,
take the quickest route back here.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.648
- Okay.
- Good.

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:56.248
Lord, heal his wound,
and free him of all suffering.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.794
Give him health,
and let him resume his mission.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:06.467
You who live and give guidance,
for all eternity. Amen.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.462
You have a visitor.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.188
- What is it?
- I am afraid.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:49.653
I cannot be alone up in that room.

01:05:55.035 --> 01:05:57.494
Have the chancellor
take you to the room.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.872
I will take care of you now.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.457
Inge.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:14.089
Hurry.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:20.136
Gisle! Let me out of here!

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.849
- Oh, no!
- Gisle!

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:34.234
Hello! Welcome to the farm!
Hi!

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.118
Welcome to the farm!

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:57.341
We must leave. We have to keep going.
We must leave.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.844
Torstein... Relax. Take it easy.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.555
- Where is Håkon? Where's Håkon?
- He's sleeping. He's sleeping.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.062
Torstein.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:14.942
I'm here.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.255
Drink this.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.301
Come on.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.596
- What is it?
- Fish oil.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.474
You need nourishment, Torstein.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.184
Yes, yeah, yeah.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.111
Now it's your turn.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.422
Refill? You want some more?

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.049
Thank you very much.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.676
Cheers.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:49.119
What is all this?

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.246
Do you think people
just go to war voluntarily?

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.915
So you have a feast?

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.917
Yes.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.211
Do they know they are going to war?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.088
No.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.426
This was all you could get?

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.554
- Yes.
- This won't work.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.806
They don't even know
they are going to war.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:13.852
Shut up!

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.271
Listen up!

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.859
We have Birkebeinerne
in the house!

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:27.366
Hey! I am not a Birkebeiner.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.952
I am just like all of you.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:31.703
A poor country farmer.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:34.831
I do my best to plough
the rocky slopes we call soil,

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:38.335
and pray to God that my family
will make it through the winter.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:42.923
The Birkebeinerne are the King's men.
But have they met him?

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:47.094
He who hides away in Nidaros, while
the Baglers are burning our lands.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:52.015
He who sits in a golden chair, sleeps
on silk linen and sucks his thumb.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:59.815
We are farmers, not warriors. But,
we are fighting for all that we love.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.151
For our families.
For our survival.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:10.450
The Baglers killed my wife.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:15.580
They butchered my boy. Eirik.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.835
He did not even reach
his second birthday.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.381
And for what?

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:28.677
For what?

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.307
The King in Nidaros is dead.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.686
But, Norway has a new King.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:42.107
And he is here with us tonight.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:05.672
This is Norway's new King.
Håkon Håkonsson.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.884
The Baglers are coming to kill him.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.680
Help me stop the Baglers
once and for all,

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:16.308
so we can unite,
under this King,

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:23.190
...and send these Bagler devils
back to hell.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:28.445
Help me. Help us.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:34.785
Not as farmers,
but as this King's men.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.621
Real Birkebeinerne.

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:57.891
Our new King.

01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:12.572
Here, Frikk.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:14.533
- No, I don't need it.
- What?

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.909
I'll take one from the Baglers.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.070
There is only one way
through the valley.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.906
The King's son and Inga
must leave first,

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.908
and they will continue
through the valley here.

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.161
Audun is here, and I am here.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:03.540
Here are the archers. Torstein,
you lead the Baglers through here.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.710
When you are close enough,
the archers will start shooting.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.670
- They're coming!
- What?

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.173
- An army is coming from the south.
- Are you sure?

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.507
It's the Baglers.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.134
Everyone get ready!

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.888
Move it! Everyone!

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.806
Håkon?

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.142
Where is Håkon?

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.561
Inga! Håkon is in the sleigh.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.522
Audun! You know what to do?

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.274
- Yes.
- Good.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.987
If they get through,
the boy dies, you know that.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:37.157
It will be fine. Trust me.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:04.434
Now, now, it will be fine, Håkon.
Mama is here. Mama will protect you.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.895
Be calm, sweet boy.
It'll be fine.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.441
They're coming!

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.544
Wait.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:35.674
Now!

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.649
A bit further.
A bit further.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:58.154
Wait here. Wait here.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:03.994
Wait.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:33.523
They've made it through.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:36.318
Wait.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:43.867
We are safe now.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:47.579
There, there. We are safe now.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.505
Here they come. Wait. Wait!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.187
Attack!

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.654
Off the horses! Attack, damn it!

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.056
Skjervald!

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.862
Here, drink this.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.490
Welcome to Ragnarok!

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.705
They're getting through!
Stop the horses!

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:00.628
Skjervald, come on!

01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:04.174
Let's get them.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.514
What did you say?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.059
Skjervald!

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:16.895
Hang on, here we go!

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:41.961
Egil! Take it easy. We are through.
Now it's up to Skjervald.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:49.844
They have broken through, damn it!

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:53.014
Drive, Egil! Hurry!

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.728
Just a couple of loose horses.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.299
Hurry! Faster!

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:14.721
They are right behind us. Hurry!

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:32.447
Hurry! Faster, Egil!

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.575
Keep going. We'll stop them.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.402
Skjervald! He got through!

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.232
Traitor!

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.491
For God's sake, Egil, faster!

01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:01.744
Faster!

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:32.859
Please don't! He is just a child.
Look at him!

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:17.153
Egil! Get up!
We must keep going!

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:51.771
Skjervald.

01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:55.107
Skjervald!

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:22.009
Skjervald. Skjervald.

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:29.100
You did it.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:33.896
We will all die.

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:38.818
But, our legacy lives on.

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.866
That's fine. Hush, hush, hush.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.496
Everything will be alright.

01:28:13.664 --> 01:28:15.081
There won't be any wedding.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.792
But, Kristin, don't show any fear.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:27.927
Someone has started a rebellion
and surrounded Nidaros Cathedral.

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:34.392
So now we will just have to
move the wedding here

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.560
to the royal residence.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:40.231
Hold the wedding ceremony here.
No guests.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.317
Do you know anything about this?

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:46.988
- No.
- Come over here.

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:50.992
I do not know anything.

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:45.296
Birkebeinere!

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:48.799
I must speak with Inge.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.094
Let me speak with Inge Bårdsson.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.013
Now.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:30:01.771
Wait! This is Håkon Håkonsson.
This is Norway's rightful King.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:19.121
No! Let go!

01:30:22.209 --> 01:30:26.670
He is the King's son.
I swear on the boy's life!

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:36.263
In the absence of your father,
King Sverre,

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.935
I give you, Kristin Sverresdatter,

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:49.318
to Earl Gisle, to honor as his wife,
in shared bed and home.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:06.460
Now I know who you are.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.251
It was God's will that you
and your kinsman, Skjervald,

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:48.752
should save the King's son.

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:53.841
I therefore name you as
Håkon Håkonsson's closest protector.

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.096
With the consent of
the Birkebeinerne,

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:04.435
I will guard the throne, just until
Håkon becomes old enough to rule.

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:13.194
You shall bring peace to our land.

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:34.051
"THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NOVELIST
AND A HISTORIAN IS THIS:

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.428
THAT THE FORMER TELLS LIES
DELIBERATELY AND FOR THE FUN OF IT;

01:39:36.596 --> 01:39:38.722
THE HISTORIAN TELLS LIES AND
IMAGINES HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH."

01:39:45.938 --> 01:39:51.068
THE LAST KING
