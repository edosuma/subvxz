00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.049 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
A feature of the KonMari Method

00:45.336 --> 00:48.256
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:51.718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.165
<i>Hello.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:05.542
<i>What's up, babe?</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:08.086
-Come here. What's up?
-Okay.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.462
-Nothing.
-How are you?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.090
I'm wet now
'cause it's raining a lot outside.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.591
-Was it raining?
-Yes.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.803
She's home.

02:16.886 --> 02:17.762
Gus!

02:18.221 --> 02:20.431
-Gus?
-It's okay, I'm watching them.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.766
-There you go.
-Where you going?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.227
Come here, baba. Over here. Okay.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.854
-It's okay.
-It's like I'm not even here.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.606
I'm Clarissa. This is Mario.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.983
I'm Mario. We've been...

02:30.608 --> 02:33.069
together now for going on six years now.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.613
You know, the first time I saw him,
I was like, "Oh!"

02:35.697 --> 02:38.575
-And I was just kinda smitten.
-How was it?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.953
This is the trip when we, like,

02:42.036 --> 02:44.539
officially became
boyfriend and girlfriend, went to Cabo.

02:44.622 --> 02:45.540
<i>It started off slow.</i>

02:45.623 --> 02:47.625
I was always here, staying the night.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.128
<i>You know, we just always hung out.</i>

02:50.211 --> 02:53.214
<i>Immediately, when I first met her,</i>
<i>I was just captivated by her eyes,</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:56.759
<i>she has beautiful eyes,</i>
<i>and her smile is what won me over.</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:58.887
Immediately, I knew
there was something there.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.763
<i>I love his personality.</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:04.934
<i>He's always, you know, trying to make</i>
<i>the best out of a situation.</i>

03:05.226 --> 03:07.729
<i>So I just-- I love everything about him.</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:09.564
And he's not bad to look at either.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.277
He used one of my eyeliners to write
"Will you be my girlfriend?"

03:14.360 --> 03:16.321
on the mirror.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.948
<i>-With a check box "yes" or "no".</i>
- <i>Did you say yes?</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:21.534
Of course I said yes.<i> </i>

03:21.951 --> 03:23.536
-We've been hanging out ever since.
-Yeah.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.998
God we, uh... I don't know
what I'd do without this girl.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.375
We complement each other so well

03:29.459 --> 03:31.169
in anything and everything that we do.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.712
So we have each other's back.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.589
Through and through.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.972
Tidying is not just about cleaning.

03:43.306 --> 03:47.227
It is also about creating a space
that sparks joy.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.397
By doing this, you get
one step closer to your ideal life.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.235
I will be visiting the house
of Mario and Clarissa.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.656
Their biggest challenge is to be able
to let go of their items from the past

03:59.906 --> 04:02.909
and to create a tidy home
for their future.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.411
I'm looking forward to helping
Mario and Clarissa

04:05.495 --> 04:07.372
as they set out on their new journey.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.249
Yeah, so...

04:09.624 --> 04:10.625
Yeah...

04:11.167 --> 04:12.085
It's getting real.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.045
Look at the other picture.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.130
-His flexing?
-Yeah.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.259
This is your kid.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.885
That's a little dude!

04:22.637 --> 04:26.599
We are expecting a little one
in about six months.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.726
-We're expecting our firstborn.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.811
It's a boy.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.980
Uh, and we are stoked.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.066
<i>We are so eager to be parents.</i>

04:35.275 --> 04:38.778
<i>Going to, you know, see the sonograms</i>
<i>or to hear the heartbeat...</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:40.029
<i>It melts you.</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:43.157
With the baby coming,
we gotta get our stuff in order,

04:43.241 --> 04:46.244
-otherwise it's gonna be more chaos.
-Yeah.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.081
<i>This is ultimately where</i>
<i>I wanna see my kids grow,</i>

04:50.290 --> 04:53.584
<i>but we are slightly overwhelmed</i>
<i>with the amount of stuff</i>

04:53.668 --> 04:55.336
<i>that we keep in certain rooms.</i>

04:55.545 --> 04:57.171
<i>That's where the problem begins.</i>

04:57.255 --> 04:59.507
<i>We've just accumulated</i>
<i>all of our extra stuff:</i>

04:59.590 --> 05:02.969
<i>clothing, shoes,</i>
<i>just whatever you can think of.</i>

05:03.052 --> 05:05.972
<i>Storage bins full of things</i>
<i>that don't get run through.</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:08.516
<i>We need to get rid of it, move it,</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:10.810
because we do need to make room now.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.563
It's not a matter
of we want to clean up this room

05:13.646 --> 05:16.024
'cause it'd be nicer that way,
now it's like we have to.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.695
I would like to have the house
as complete as possible

05:20.778 --> 05:24.574
and still have some time
before the baby gets here.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.994
I don't want my water to break
in the middle of us painting or something.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.205
Well, Mario painting,
'cause I won't be painting.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.666
It's time.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.879
We're gonna have to part ways
with a lot of things we don't want to.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.213
Yeah.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.883
-But it's all for the better.
-Yeah.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.344
All for the better of our guests,

05:44.677 --> 05:48.014
our family, our friends, and the baby.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.665
Oh, this is it?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.422
-Oh.
-Moment of truth.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.216
-Here we go.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.634
Oh, Lord, here we are.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.931
-Hi! Hello!
-Hello. Welcome!

06:30.014 --> 06:31.391
Nice to meet you. I'm Marie.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.226
-Nice to meet you.
-Miss Marie, Mario.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.937
Nice to meet you, Miss Marie.
Welcome to our home.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.064
-Thank you for inviting me.
- No, thank you.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.400
We're excited
that you're coming to help us.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.570
Yes, I'm so excited
about tidying this house.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.655
We're excited, too.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.490
-A little nervous, but excited.
-Yes.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.493
-Don't worry. Have fun.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.703
Okay. It'll be fun.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.248
-Good, good. We can't wait to get started.
-Yeah.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.376
So this is one of the areas, for example,

06:58.459 --> 07:01.254
that we've put it together,
and eliminated some of the clutter out.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.592
So, I'm just so excited
to see all the other rooms.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.970
-Are you ready? Okay, let's do this.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.222
This is our kitchen.

07:11.305 --> 07:15.518
So, I mean, trying to keep it
as organized as we can, but...

07:17.145 --> 07:19.605
- So do both of you cook?
- Yes.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.691
Yes, we do. I specialize in breakfast.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.318
She kinda handles the other two meals.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.696
- Trouble drawers.
- Just junk.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.198
So, this is receipts...

07:29.282 --> 07:32.118
Oh, you can't even open it
because she's stuffed her gum in there.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.787
We could get rid
of a lot of the stuff that's in here.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.041
Yes, I agree. I think this place
will change very dramatically.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.795
Oh, man! I can't wait.
I can't wait.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.631
The next space that I guess needs help,

07:45.965 --> 07:47.592
-the office.
- Ah.

07:47.675 --> 07:48.718
Um...

07:49.051 --> 07:51.137
Over time,
things have just gotten stored in there.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.390
I hold onto things and throw 'em here,
just so they're out of the way.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.646
So, are there any spaces that you
use as an office besides this one spot?

08:00.730 --> 08:01.731
-No.
-No.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.942
Because we do most of our--
our tablets and our laptops,

08:05.026 --> 08:07.487
we take with us wherever we go,
into every room.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.615
So doesn't serve us really any purpose.

08:10.698 --> 08:15.203
One thing that we're considering is
it possibly being a nursery,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
because we are expecting our first child.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.706
Oh!

08:18.789 --> 08:21.042
-So....
-Oh, you have child?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.044
-We're carrying it right now.
-Congratulations!

08:23.127 --> 08:24.712
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.967
I think this is an excellent
opportunity for you to tidy,

08:30.051 --> 08:31.677
because my clients have told me

08:31.761 --> 08:34.430
that they're so glad that
they got it over with before the baby.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.557
- Oh, yeah.
- Because of time.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.059
-Of course.
-Yes.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.394
I can understand,
because I have two babies.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.854
- Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

08:42.355 --> 08:44.565
You should expect
to have a lot more things.

08:46.776 --> 08:52.073
When your first child
is born, your world changes completely.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.493
So you get to imagine
what kind of parents you want to be,

08:55.576 --> 08:58.371
or how you want to live as a family.

08:58.454 --> 09:02.833
This is the excitement
that parents get to experience

09:02.917 --> 09:07.421
as they tidy for their first child.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.342
<i>For me, what changed</i>
<i>after my daughters were born,</i>

09:11.425 --> 09:16.347
<i>was that no matter how much I tidied,</i>
<i>my daughters would pull things out.</i>

09:16.430 --> 09:18.558
<i>So keeping a tidy house</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:21.018
became very difficult.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.854
Okay, so we'll go ahead
and go upstairs.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.569
- Up here is two bedrooms.
- Yeah.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.029
We both have
a lot of shoes, so...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.115
- Oh!

09:34.240 --> 09:36.867
-So should we have shoe racks?
-Yeah.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.744
Call it the clutter room.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.831
-I like it. Yeah, he's so cool.
- He's cool, right?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.291
That's what I saw!

09:43.374 --> 09:46.043
This we use as a guest bedroom.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.255
-These are Mario's shoes. So...
-Ah!

09:49.505 --> 09:50.423
Yes.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.507
That's me.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.513
I've been collecting sneakers now
for over 25 years.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.182
Oh, 25 years!

10:00.266 --> 10:05.563
And it was a lot worse.
Now it's only about 150, 160.

10:09.567 --> 10:13.863
I've been collecting sneakers
since I was 12 years old.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.032
-Put 'em down on the floor, look at 'em?
-Yeah.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.367
That way you really know
what you have.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.787
<i>I loved sneakers, I loved sports,</i>
<i>I loved athletes.</i>

10:21.871 --> 10:23.497
<i>These are the people I looked up to,</i>

10:23.581 --> 10:25.625
<i>and it sounded so far-fetched</i>
<i>for me back then,</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:27.627
<i>but I think when I became an adult, and...</i>

10:27.710 --> 10:31.380
as I started having an income,
that was a priority,

10:31.464 --> 10:36.552
and I started just kinda buying,
and it got maybe a little out of control.

10:37.219 --> 10:41.891
<i>Ninety-five percent of them</i>
<i>were never used, never unlaced,</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:43.768
<i>let alone ever tried on.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:46.812
<i>So, more than anything,</i>
<i>I'm ready to get started.</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:54.403
So first, really look
at all the shoes that you own.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.072
Everything.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.874
Alright, we got some work.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.461
- You'll be able to do it, trust me.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.963
- We trust you.
- Yes.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.173
Alright.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.174
Let's go.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.893
So, tidying will begin now.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.811
-Yes.
-Okay.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.939
Before starting,
I would like to greet your house.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.315
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.363
Greeting house is very important for me.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.864
Okay, good.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.116
Thank you.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.366
- Thanks.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.035
-Thank you so much for giving me the time.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.203
-Sure.
-No problem.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.582
-Okay, so let's begin tidying.
-Okay.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.918
Oh, my. Let's go. Ready.
-What's first?
- The first step is clothing.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.132
-Clothing, ooh.
-Okay.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.719
Put them into a pile.

12:41.927 --> 12:42.928
Okay.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.430
-Okay.
-Down here.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.682
- Here?
-Here. All of your clothes.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.100
-Everything?
-All the clothes?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.226
All the clothes.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.228
- Okay.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.606
Oh, my-- That's a lot of clothes, Marie.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.149
- I know.
-Yes?

12:55.232 --> 12:56.609
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.611
- We begin now.
-Alright.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.030
Okay, let's go.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.281
Oh, God.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.327
-Can you take that off, babe?
- Yeah.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.871
I can't reach.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.039
-Yeah.
-Babe, help!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.708
I'm trying, I'm trying.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.460
I need your help, of course.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.836
Oh, God.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.342
So this will be
Clarissa's mountain.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.677
This isn't even..
close to all of it.
'Cause we want everything.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.308
-Like, drawers too?
- Yes.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.935
-Wow.
- Yes, drawers, everything.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.770
This is gonna get in tomorrow.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.273
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.734
-I see a unicorn outfit. What is that?
-It's a onesie.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.320
It's a onesie? That I've never seen?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.490
-This'll be a lot of homework.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.825
Dang it.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.454
-This girl is no joke.
-This is giving me anxiety.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.206
-Deep breaths.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.501
-Alright, you still...
-It's still not as bad as--

13:56.585 --> 13:57.753
Are you kidding?

14:06.011 --> 14:09.139
This mess...

14:09.265 --> 14:10.558
...makes me...

14:11.809 --> 14:15.479
it's kinda like I need to--
Everything needs to be out of here.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.820
- Yeah, this is a lot.
-Yeah.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.530
Yeah.

14:24.613 --> 14:29.118
But this is so important,
to see everything you have.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
-See it, right it?
- See, yeah.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.205
I knew we had a lot. I didn't...

14:34.331 --> 14:35.791
envision this.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.917
-Yeah.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.169
When you see clothes laid out,

14:39.253 --> 14:41.547
displayed entirely, this is my life.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.177
So from here on out,
you will be selecting things

14:47.636 --> 14:49.638
that sparks joy for you.

14:50.097 --> 14:50.931
Okay.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.392
- Spark joy.
-Spark joy.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.936
So this is...

14:56.437 --> 14:57.730
Yes.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.398
Yes.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.276
-Yes.
- Alright.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.360
Yes.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.195
Yes.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.488
Yes.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.324
Yes. Keep.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.701
<i>He has a lot of clothes, and...</i>

15:10.784 --> 15:13.162
<i>I think a lot of the stuff</i>
<i>going into the love,</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:14.496
<i>love...</i>

15:14.580 --> 15:18.626
love, and I'm like,
where's the stuff you're getting rid of?

15:19.710 --> 15:20.836
No.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.464
No.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.842
-No.
-Goodbye, sir.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.636
And this is goodbye?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.679
-Not yet.
-Not yet? Alright.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.973
I'm still yes, no. Like...

15:33.349 --> 15:36.602
Touch it. I don't know,
I might need it this summer.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.771
This is hard. This is sentimental.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.525
What I recommend when that happens
is to start with something

15:43.609 --> 15:45.861
that's really easy to make
a quick decision.

15:45.945 --> 15:46.862
There you go.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.574
Oh, yeah, this is not fun. Right now.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.576
But I know, I get it.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.827
-No.
-That's a no?

15:53.911 --> 15:54.912
I'm saying goodbye.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.664
-Thank you.
-Reluctantly, that's a no?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.581
Yeah.

16:02.586 --> 16:06.882
Many people may feel guilty
when letting go of items.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.511
<i>By expressing gratitude toward</i>
<i>the items you let go,</i>

16:10.594 --> 16:13.305
<i>it will lessen the feeling of guilt.</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:15.224
Thank you very much.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.477
For example, it's important to express

16:18.560 --> 16:22.314
gratitude toward clothes you never wore.

16:22.398 --> 16:27.403
This is because the shirt taught you

16:27.486 --> 16:31.198
that you do not like
to wear shirts like this.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.577
By doing this, it will become clear

16:35.661 --> 16:37.997
what is necessary for you.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.377
So, I think it's going pretty smoothly,

16:43.460 --> 16:47.256
so I was thinking of assigning
all the rest for homework.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.216
Okay, so we're done here, right?

16:49.299 --> 16:52.136
- That's it, right?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.973
I'm realizing a lot of these clothes
I haven't touched in years.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.182
Okay.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.102
<i>I have a lot of stuff, man,</i>
<i>and I don't let go of things,</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:02.646
<i>so it's gonna be hard.</i>
<i>It's gonna be rough.</i>

17:02.730 --> 17:05.482
-Less clutter and more homework, right?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.901
-Alright, thank you.
-Okay, thank you. Bye.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.361
-Have a good night. Bye.
-Bye, guys.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.696
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.828
No.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.290
That's still a lot of shoes.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.876
No.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.089
No.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.051
<i>Starting to feel good</i>
<i>about the process,</i>

17:32.134 --> 17:34.928
<i>starting to really get rid</i>
<i>of a lot of stuff.</i>

17:35.179 --> 17:38.098
Things that I haven't used,
whether it be clothing, shoes,

17:38.182 --> 17:42.686
you know, some purses
I'm fine with getting rid of, and just...

17:42.770 --> 17:45.022
<i>creating more space. So, I'm not...</i>

17:45.105 --> 17:47.483
someone that's gonna
hold onto something that...

17:47.858 --> 17:50.694
I haven't used in years
just because I want to keep it.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.612
<i>But...</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:53.781
<i>I don't know if that's happened for Mario.</i>

17:53.864 --> 17:57.117
I'm interested to see
how quickly he's willing to actually

17:57.201 --> 17:58.577
get rid of something.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.291
<i>Because he's definitely got much more</i>
<i>of an emotional attachment to things.</i>

18:04.374 --> 18:06.168
- Come on.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.252
Come on, I'm sorting.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.546
You guys come here,
I'm not gonna be able to do anything.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.423
Oh.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.009
Yeah, this one I don't know
if I can part ways with.

18:14.093 --> 18:14.927
This one means a lot.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.847
'Cause despite whatever struggles

18:18.931 --> 18:21.183
or financial burdens my parents
were going through,

18:21.266 --> 18:23.977
I think actually my Dad might have been
unemployed that Christmas.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.065
And nonetheless,
I remember he took us to go buy.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.069
These were real sacrifices
that my parents were going through,

18:33.612 --> 18:36.907
to sometimes just put a smile on our--
me and my brother's face.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.702
I've kept things
just because I do appreciate

18:40.786 --> 18:42.246
what my family has done.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.541
My first Guatemala soccer jersey.
<i>So, it's not as easy</i>

18:49.336 --> 18:52.089
<i>as I thought it was gonna be</i>
<i>to let go of some of this stuff.</i>

18:53.632 --> 18:54.842
Yeah.

18:54.925 --> 18:58.220
<i>But, uh, I guess you just sit back</i>
<i>and trust the process.</i>

18:58.303 --> 19:00.305
Granted, I haven't got to my shoes yet,

19:00.389 --> 19:02.015
which I think is gonna be
the hardest part.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.393
But I think that, uh...

19:04.977 --> 19:07.146
I'll take my time with that,
I will say that.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.190
But no, that's staying. That's-- Yeah.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.074
- Oh!

19:21.493 --> 19:22.327
Hello.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.580
- Hello.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.583
- Hi. How are you?
-Hi. Good.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.751
-How are you?
-How's it going? Nice to see you.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.378
-Nice to see you. Hi.
-Hi!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.172
Hi. Good to see you again.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.424
- How are you guys doing?

19:35.507 --> 19:37.217
<i>- </i>We're good.
<i>- </i>Good.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.387
-I'd love to see the closets first.
-Okay.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.015
-If that's okay.
- Closets, alright.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.226
Mine. And then his is over...

19:46.518 --> 19:48.520
-Wow.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.609
How did you feel sorting through
your clothes and making selections?

19:53.692 --> 19:57.279
I feel good. It was nice to get rid
of things that I don't use anymore

19:57.362 --> 20:00.157
and things that I know
that I'm not going to use, so...

20:02.284 --> 20:04.411
How about the clothes that you folded?
May I see those?

20:04.494 --> 20:05.329
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

20:05.412 --> 20:07.706
Okay, so there is my dresser.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.667
So all of this pretty much took up
this whole drawer.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.923
- You are so great at folding!

20:16.006 --> 20:18.508
-Thank you.
- I'm surprised. I'm stunned.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.597
-The socks, I can recommend another way.
- Okay.

20:24.014 --> 20:24.973
Ooh.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.518
-So just stack them together like this.

20:28.894 --> 20:29.895
Fold in half.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.854
-Oh, okay.
-You see?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.773
And then that way you can stack them all.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.901
And also the band won't stretch out. Yeah.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.862
Yeah, I throw away a lot of socks
'cause that happens.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.366
Okay, babe, it's your turn.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.285
- Please.
-Thank you.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.997
-Oh!

20:49.081 --> 20:52.251
-Yes, the same method, I think too.
- Socks, I've done the same here.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.254
I have socks, bigger socks obviously.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.840
How would you fold that technique
that you were telling Clarissa

20:59.216 --> 21:00.550
with something like this?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.974
For socks of this length,
I would recommend folding it in thirds.

21:07.057 --> 21:07.891
Okay.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.768
For thicker materials like this...

21:09.851 --> 21:11.103
- Okay.
-...thirds work.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.604
And just file it as well.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.897
Okay.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.068
I think you guys are on
a very, very good pace.

21:18.151 --> 21:21.488
But what's important is that you guys
are motivated to transform your lives.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.740
- We are.
- That's what matters the most.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.329
So after clothes,
the next category is books,

21:29.413 --> 21:31.707
right after that is paper documents.

21:35.502 --> 21:39.965
Tidying together
is a great way for couples

21:40.048 --> 21:43.176
to see if they share the same values.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.097
From here, I'd like for them to learn
the importance of working together.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.419
<i>Okay, so I'm gonna start</i>
<i>moving the papers.</i>

22:17.502 --> 22:19.838
Just realized, babe,
this is all your stuff.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.215
-This ain't none of mine.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.260
The black stuff is yours.
- Yeah, that little container.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.554
Oh, jeez.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.474
I hold on to note books.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.933
I'm just like you.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.268
I have stickers.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.561
Why?

22:34.644 --> 22:37.230
My prom... invitation.
-You got stuff I think you can--
- That I'm keeping.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.568
Shred.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.488
Shred.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.741
One thing for me I think
which was so easy for me to kind of...

22:48.116 --> 22:50.160
get rid of things is,

22:50.243 --> 22:53.372
<i>if I'm looking at it and it's not</i>
<i>something I like or not something that</i>

22:53.455 --> 22:55.832
<i>strikes anything in me,</i>
<i>I'm fine with getting rid of it.</i>

22:55.916 --> 22:58.377
An unopened invitation
to my brother's wedding.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.796
I'm keeping that one.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.465
These are from all our holiday parties.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.050
These are keep.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.676
<i>Argh!</i>

23:06.760 --> 23:09.721
<i>But I don't know</i>
<i>if Mario's fully there yet.</i>

23:10.305 --> 23:12.140
<i>He's still not getting rid of things.</i>

23:12.516 --> 23:14.893
What's this little pile I see here, hmm?

23:14.976 --> 23:17.020
Oh, this is just some...

23:17.646 --> 23:21.024
stuff that needs to kinda find a place
here in the house still.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.068
<i>It's a little frustrating just because</i>

23:23.151 --> 23:26.279
we have a set timeline
where we're gonna be expecting a baby

23:26.613 --> 23:28.782
in, what, five months?

23:28.865 --> 23:31.076
<i>I'm worried because, even though</i>

23:31.326 --> 23:34.663
<i>it's five months away,</i>
<i>like, the days seem slow.</i>

23:34.746 --> 23:36.832
But then all of a sudden, like,
a month goes by

23:36.915 --> 23:38.333
and I'm like, "How did that happen?"

23:38.417 --> 23:39.334
Okay.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.129
I'm working on it, babe.
I'm working on laying on this couch.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.047
Probably shouldn't be
in the living room, but...

23:45.841 --> 23:49.261
I definitely hope that Marie really helps
get him in line

23:49.344 --> 23:53.223
with what needs to be done,
because I could tell him

23:53.682 --> 23:56.143
ten times to move something
or put it away,

23:56.226 --> 23:58.353
and he's gonna do it when he wants to.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.564
You still have homework to do.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.527
- <i>Just you today?</i>

24:05.652 --> 24:07.446
- <i>Yes, just me today.</i>
- <i>Yes? Okay.</i>

24:08.822 --> 24:11.825
I think your next assignment
is gonna be miscellaneous items.

24:11.908 --> 24:12.742
Okay.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.703
Maybe garage.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.288
That'd be great. Yes, I'd love to.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.294
- Excuse me.
- Alright.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.588
The garage seems to be a little neater.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.465
-Wow, very clean.
-We picked up a little bit.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.757
Yeah.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.302
Um, our doggies are out here
hanging out for now.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.639
- Mario, I was wondering.
-Yes?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.267
Is there anything in here
that you would let go?

24:37.350 --> 24:40.145
Most of the stuff here
still has function.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.397
Like, I have a lot of tile...

24:42.481 --> 24:44.316
-...stored away here.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.943
These are essential electrical supplies

24:47.027 --> 24:49.488
that we're gonna need
once we redo this room,

24:49.571 --> 24:53.074
so, uh, there is a purpose
for all this stuff eventually.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.703
Okay, let's just take everything out.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.621
Okay.

24:58.413 --> 25:02.083
Anything you want to keep,
try to keep them in separate categories.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.752
- Separate categories? Okay.
-Yeah.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.463
-Uh, and for the doggies.
- Ah, doggy. Okay.

25:06.880 --> 25:11.051
And this is a vintage clock
that someone gave to me.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.679
This is the alarm clock
that woke me up every day for high school

25:14.763 --> 25:16.723
and I loved it so much.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.976
I'm just that kinda dude
that attaches emotion to things, you know?

25:20.060 --> 25:23.188
<i>I might be</i>
<i>what some people call sentimental.</i>

25:23.271 --> 25:25.273
<i>And I guess over the course of time,</i>

25:25.357 --> 25:28.068
I've found it really hard
to part ways with some of this stuff.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.737
<i>As scary as it is for me to admit,</i>

25:30.820 --> 25:34.074
<i>I definitely need just an intervention.</i>

25:34.491 --> 25:36.284
Now, here's a good question for you,

25:36.368 --> 25:38.954
because this does have some type
of sentimental value.

25:39.037 --> 25:39.871
Ah.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.082
Because this was the mailbox

25:42.624 --> 25:45.794
that was originally on the home
when I purchased it.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.713
So how do you feel
about something like this?

25:50.131 --> 25:52.300
So, when you hold this
in your hand,

25:52.384 --> 25:54.052
does it still spark joy for you?

25:59.641 --> 26:02.227
I guess joy wouldn't be
the right word to identify this

26:02.310 --> 26:04.187
as to what it means to me, because...

26:05.647 --> 26:08.191
it's just a reminder of, hey...

26:09.067 --> 26:11.069
You know? For what it's worth,
I never thought that,

26:11.152 --> 26:13.697
you know, to have my parents come
from Guatemala,

26:13.905 --> 26:16.575
and where they came from,
to be here in America now,

26:16.658 --> 26:19.244
and have their home and, you know,

26:19.327 --> 26:23.081
have their son have his home
three doors down from them

26:23.164 --> 26:25.500
is something that I think no way

26:26.001 --> 26:29.129
could they have ever fathomed
or even thought of ever happening.

26:29.212 --> 26:33.049
So, that's why I guess little things
like this mean something to me.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.220
But this is something
that you'd like to keep

26:37.304 --> 26:39.097
as part of your life going forward?

26:43.018 --> 26:44.436
When you put it that way...

26:44.894 --> 26:45.729
no.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.148
I can comfortably say that

26:48.732 --> 26:50.775
the mailbox I have outside

26:50.859 --> 26:54.279
is more joy than what this is, because...

26:55.905 --> 26:57.699
it's something that we did together.

26:58.825 --> 26:59.826
I can let it go.
Thank you.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.459
<i>Through the Kondo process,</i>
<i>yes, it's changing me as we speak</i>

27:07.542 --> 27:09.461
<i>and it's starting to make sense.</i>

27:10.128 --> 27:11.796
<i>It's time to let go of some of this stuff.</i>

27:12.505 --> 27:16.134
I don't know who the Mario's gonna be
after this process, but...

27:16.718 --> 27:19.137
it's uncharted territory,
and I'm really

27:19.220 --> 27:21.598
kinda anxious to see where it ends.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.184
I mean, I was anxious to get here.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.644
So now that we're here,

27:25.727 --> 27:29.272
I feel like now I'm gonna go through this
as much and as hard as possible.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.108
So next time you're here,
maybe it looks different.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.027
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.612
<i>-Gracias.</i>
<i>-Gracias.</i>

27:41.493 --> 27:44.913
And Mario right now
is going through paperwork.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.706
-Huh, babe?
-Yeah.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.502
-Let the shredding commence.
-Let the shredding commence.

27:51.544 --> 27:53.880
<i>The wheels are in motion,</i>
<i>and I'm just seeing...</i>

27:54.381 --> 27:57.592
seeing and looking at things completely
from a different perspective.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.469
I'm really second guessing everything

27:59.552 --> 28:02.097
as to why it's here,
why we're keeping things.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.140
I'll keep.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.143
That's it?

28:07.602 --> 28:11.773
We have a lot more real estate here.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.067
- So here we go.
-Trash.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.905
Mario's about to dump
a whole bunch of stuff in the trash.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.616
<i>I think Mario's mindset</i>
<i>has definitely changed.</i>

28:21.700 --> 28:24.202
<i>It was a bit hard at first for him</i>
<i>to get rid of things,</i>

28:24.285 --> 28:26.287
<i>but he's much better than before.</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:28.415
And Mario's much...

28:28.748 --> 28:31.918
much more eager to get things done
right then and there.

28:32.001 --> 28:36.798
So, I've gone ahead
and emptied all of the drawers here.

28:37.298 --> 28:40.051
And got through everything in the kitchen.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.137
And I'm excited, it looks...

28:42.220 --> 28:45.306
completely different than
what it looked like before.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.810
<i>I'm more surprised about how Clari</i>
<i>has come along in this whole process.</i>

28:49.394 --> 28:52.772
<i>There's this driving force behind her</i>
<i>and I can't help but to feed off of her.</i>

28:52.856 --> 28:55.400
<i>I got a pregnant girl</i>
<i>that's doing the work here.</i>

28:55.483 --> 28:57.861
The last thing I want her to do
is feel stressed,

28:57.944 --> 28:59.571
especially going through this pregnancy.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.240
I want her to be confident
knowing that I have her back

29:02.323 --> 29:04.993
and I'm supportive with anything
and everything that she might need.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.494
There's our little guy.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.205
Twelve weeks. He's much bigger now.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.000
Teeny tiny.
He's as big as a dollar bill today.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.711
<i>Obviously we're transitioning</i>
<i>into parenthood</i>

29:14.794 --> 29:17.714
<i>and to have this kind of approach</i>
<i>of tidying things up</i>

29:17.797 --> 29:21.092
ultimately be part
of our everyday kinda habits,

29:21.176 --> 29:25.013
that's kind of the life I wanna lead,
you know, when my son gets here.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.858
Oh, man.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.952
Before the whole process even started,

29:48.036 --> 29:51.080
I knew, I was kinda hesitant to, you know,

29:51.289 --> 29:55.210
get started with what was gonna be
addressing my shoe situation.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.920
Oh, man.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.464
Because those are the ones
that are dear to me,

29:59.798 --> 30:02.217
that obviously has
more sentiment behind...

30:02.300 --> 30:05.345
um, each and every one
of those pairs of shoes.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.847
<i>But I think I'm finally ready.</i>

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
<i>It's time to part ways</i>
<i>and de-clutter some of these shoes.</i>

30:11.100 --> 30:12.143
The first pair.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.856
You'll stay here.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.199
<i>$10,000 worth of credit card debt.</i>

30:26.282 --> 30:28.785
<i>I remember that was the first time</i>
<i>I realized I had a problem.</i>

30:28.868 --> 30:30.703
Debt to tennis shoes.

30:31.454 --> 30:35.041
No, that's not what I want my little man
to think is...

30:35.124 --> 30:36.835
what life is, nah.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.755
<i>I don't ever want him</i>
<i>to glorify anything materialistic.</i>

30:47.637 --> 30:48.763
That hurts.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.391
Never got to wear you guys.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.477
Well...

30:57.981 --> 30:59.983
<i>Some of these shoes have been with me...</i>

31:00.567 --> 31:02.735
<i>God, over three decades.</i>

31:03.111 --> 31:07.198
<i>These are like childhood sneakers</i>
<i>that I might have preserved because...</i>

31:07.532 --> 31:09.826
<i>even though they weren't my size</i>
<i>as an adult,</i>
<i>I still kept them just</i>
<i>for the sake of what they were</i>

31:12.287 --> 31:14.914
<i>when I first was introduced to them</i>
<i>or laid my eyes on them.</i>

31:16.165 --> 31:17.500
Almost the same exact shoe.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.002
But...

31:19.335 --> 31:22.046
now into my adulthood
and let alone transitioning

31:22.130 --> 31:24.507
into the next chapter of my life,
which is fatherhood,

31:24.841 --> 31:28.011
I realize that certain things have kind
of served their purpose with me,

31:28.094 --> 31:31.222
<i>and I guess maybe that's more</i>
<i>of an invitation now, metaphorically,</i>

31:31.306 --> 31:32.140
<i>to what's to come,</i>

31:32.223 --> 31:35.184
and just open to receiving
whatever it is that comes my way,

31:35.268 --> 31:37.645
that I'm kind of detaching myself from...

31:37.729 --> 31:39.814
what was that kinda like...

31:39.898 --> 31:41.774
that mindset
that I had when I was younger.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.111
Hello.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.112
What's up?

31:47.572 --> 31:48.865
What are you doing?

31:49.198 --> 31:50.158
Trying.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.705
Looking at things differently.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.543
Do we have a...

32:01.461 --> 32:04.255
a, uh, give away or...

32:04.339 --> 32:06.090
-Yeah, those.
-...don't keep? These?

32:07.133 --> 32:10.261
So, you're giving away all the shoes
that I've actually seen you wear.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.556
Yeah, because I intend to wear
the ones that I love now.

32:15.642 --> 32:20.313
<i>I'm definitely proud of Mario</i>
<i>because he's finally willing</i>

32:20.396 --> 32:23.274
<i>to part with shoes that he has held onto.</i>

32:23.483 --> 32:26.611
And the amount
that he has chosen to get rid of,

32:27.111 --> 32:29.238
to me, was surprising because I didn't--

32:29.697 --> 32:30.865
I'd never seen that before,

32:30.949 --> 32:34.452
so I certainly didn't expect him
to get rid of as much as he did.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.622
So that was-- that was surprising to me.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.792
This has never happened
with this pair of shoes.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.460
-Do they fit?
-Yes.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.212
-Like a glove.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.009
-You bought those, what, four years ago?
-Yeah.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.722
And if that doesn't tell you something.
I've never even put 'em on.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.100
It feels good.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.484
There are many people like Mario

33:06.567 --> 33:10.822
who want to display their shoes.

33:34.220 --> 33:38.016
This arrangement creates
an aesthetic balance to the shoe rack.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.998
Hello, hello.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.542
-Ah, hello!
- Hi.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.710
Hi!

34:05.793 --> 34:08.504
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

34:08.588 --> 34:09.756
I'm doing really well.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.632
-Good, good.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.302
-The house is yours for you to...

34:14.385 --> 34:16.304
...run through it and see what you think.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.805
And please, we're always ears

34:17.889 --> 34:20.767
to anything that you're gonna
counsel us to do.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.936
I'm most interested in the rooms upstairs.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.739
- Phenomenal. Wow.
- Yeah.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.741
<i>I think I took the most from this process,</i>

34:36.824 --> 34:38.618
just because I, uh...

34:38.951 --> 34:41.037
I did have a lot of stuff.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.623
<i>Where I started,</i>
<i>I was over 160 pairs of sneakers,</i>

34:44.165 --> 34:47.293
<i>and that's now chipped away</i>
<i>to probably, like, below 45.</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:49.128
<i>It feels good.</i>

34:49.921 --> 34:52.548
I have an appreciation now
for the things that I did keep

34:52.965 --> 34:56.636
and, most importantly,
it made things easy to part with.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.224
Wow, this area changed so much!

35:01.307 --> 35:03.518
<i>And so I don't ever see myself</i>
<i>going back to</i>

35:03.601 --> 35:06.187
<i>the way I was before</i>
<i>Marie came into our lives.</i>

35:06.270 --> 35:08.356
<i>Just the techniques</i>
<i>we've learned, you know,</i>

35:08.439 --> 35:09.607
<i>folding the clothes,</i>

35:09.690 --> 35:12.110
I think it's just gonna make it
a lot easier for us

35:12.193 --> 35:15.154
to continue to keep the house,
you know, clean and in order.

35:15.863 --> 35:18.491
<i>The kitchen is probably</i>
<i>the biggest change.</i>

35:20.785 --> 35:24.122
<i>I'm really happy that</i>
<i>the kitchen looks the way it does now.</i>

35:26.290 --> 35:30.128
<i>The counter tops are as,</i>
<i>you know, empty as they can be.</i>

35:31.087 --> 35:33.631
<i>The cabinets are organized.</i>

35:35.258 --> 35:38.386
- <i>You've worked so hard, you guys!</i>
- <i>Thank you!</i>

35:38.469 --> 35:40.847
- <i>Oh, Clarissa.</i>

35:42.348 --> 35:43.850
Okay.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.481
<i>Wow!</i>

35:53.151 --> 35:55.528
<i>Yes, I think this</i>
<i>is remarkably done.</i>

35:55.611 --> 35:56.571
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

35:56.946 --> 35:58.489
<i>I love walking in here now.</i>

35:58.573 --> 36:01.450
<i>I literally have come here</i>
<i>just to grab a chair,</i>

36:01.534 --> 36:03.369
<i>sit on my phone,</i>
<i>and just hang out in here.</i>

36:03.911 --> 36:05.580
<i>So I just want</i>
<i>to commend you, Mario,</i>

36:05.663 --> 36:07.832
<i>because how I remember</i>
<i>this garage was</i>

36:07.915 --> 36:10.293
<i>on the first day, to this dramatic change?</i>

36:10.376 --> 36:12.795
- <i>It was bad.</i>
- <i>This is very impressive.</i>

36:14.839 --> 36:17.383
- Great job on the garage.
-Thank you. Thank you.

36:17.466 --> 36:18.885
He passed, right?

36:20.094 --> 36:22.722
-He more than passed. Very good.
- With flying colors.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.849
I can't believe how much progress
we've made from

36:24.932 --> 36:26.893
what the house looked like to, you know,

36:26.976 --> 36:29.562
<i>once Marie got here,</i>
<i>to what we've been able to do now.</i>

36:29.645 --> 36:31.981
So I'm just completely surprised,

36:32.064 --> 36:34.108
had no idea it would
end up looking like this.

36:35.234 --> 36:36.360
Alright.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.532
I can clearly see
that you guys both

36:41.616 --> 36:44.243
worked so hard in the tidying process.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.788
It was a bit stressful
'cause it was just so much at once,

36:48.039 --> 36:52.376
um, but I'm very happy
with the end result.

36:52.460 --> 36:56.756
I feel like 95% of everything
is where it needs to be,

36:56.839 --> 36:59.759
so I don't feel as overwhelmed
with the amount of work

36:59.842 --> 37:02.595
that we need to do
to ultimately, like, clean.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.890
<i>The office area since that's...</i>
<i>looking like it's gonna be</i>
<i>the final spot for the nursery.</i>

37:09.602 --> 37:12.230
<i>It's, I mean, obviously not ready</i>
<i>for us to do that yet.</i>

37:12.313 --> 37:15.566
<i>The desk is in there, there is stuff</i>
<i>that just needs to not be in there,</i>

37:15.650 --> 37:17.193
<i>but it's very close.</i>

37:19.820 --> 37:22.949
But I think now,
you said you're 95% there,

37:23.032 --> 37:25.493
but the road to 100%,
I think it's very clear.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.287
- Yeah.
-I have every faith that you can finish.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.624
<i>I know that along this process</i>
<i>we've gotten stronger.</i>

37:31.707 --> 37:34.126
I am so eager and so motivated,

37:34.210 --> 37:36.212
now more than ever, to just...

37:36.587 --> 37:38.506
plow through as much as I possibly can

37:38.589 --> 37:41.550
in terms of addressing things
and projects around the home.

37:41.634 --> 37:46.138
Just to see it just coming to fruition,
it's just, it's so--

37:46.222 --> 37:48.683
Such a good feeling
and I'm hooked on that feeling right now.

37:49.183 --> 37:51.686
-We'll be done before the baby's here.
-Yes.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.604
And much before the baby gets here

37:53.688 --> 37:56.232
because we do wanna enjoy
this free time that we now have.

37:59.193 --> 38:01.988
So, is it okay if I ask
when the baby is due?

38:02.071 --> 38:05.157
In August. So do you wanna go grab
the new pictures?

38:05.241 --> 38:07.994
Would you like to see him?
Yes, I'll get 'em.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.124
This is a great timing
that you finished this.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.959
Yeah, that's what we're thinking.

38:15.042 --> 38:17.336
That's why, you know,
we're kind of putting...

38:17.420 --> 38:20.965
deadlines on all the other things
we wanna get done to just...

38:21.465 --> 38:22.925
-Please.
-...enjoy.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.262
Here, let's put 'em down there.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.431
-Put 'em on the table.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.224
I can see the face!

38:30.308 --> 38:33.227
- Oh, my gosh! It's a person!

38:34.937 --> 38:37.440
- Oh, there he is.
- So, yeah, he is a boy.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.527
Oh, I can see.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.657
What an amazing thing to look forward to.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.243
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much. I'm honored.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.329
- So, <i>gracias.</i>
-<i>Gracias.</i>

38:51.412 --> 38:53.622
-<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

38:53.706 --> 38:55.166
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

38:55.249 --> 38:56.876
Yes, to you. Thank you.

38:59.628 --> 39:03.758
Do you know how to say
"spark joy" in Spanish?

39:03.841 --> 39:05.092
<i>Te,</i> T. E.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.093
<i>-Te.</i>
<i>-Trae.</i>

39:06.177 --> 39:07.678
-<i>Trae.</i>
<i>-Alegria.</i>
<i>Te trae alegria.</i>

39:09.347 --> 39:11.057
-That's lovely.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.809
- I love the sound of that.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.020
<i>Mario and Clarissa learned</i>

39:16.103 --> 39:19.357
the tools to create their ideal life,

39:19.440 --> 39:22.360
through this tidying process.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.029
Even though they are still
not completely finished,

39:25.112 --> 39:28.115
I'm sure by the time their son arrives,
their home will be ready.

39:28.616 --> 39:31.494
I hope Mario, Clarissa, and their son

39:31.577 --> 39:33.662
will continue to spark
a lot of joy in their future.
