00:35.560 --> 00:37.198
Hello?

00:37.640 --> 00:40.359
Saffy, it's me. Listen...

00:40.560 --> 00:43.870
Darling, I'm in the isolation tank
in my bathroom.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.789
Don't leave the house
without telling me. All right?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.037
I'm going to see
if I can last another 15 minutes.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.630
Okay. A call came through for Patsy,
but I couldn't find her.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.195
All right. Okay.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.472
There's a call come through for you, Pats.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.756
I'd better go, Eddy.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.192
Here we go.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.359
You're gonna have to get used
to doing it on your own, darling.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.190
Just keep talking to me.
Keep talking to me. All right?

01:16.400 --> 01:19.312
Don't shut the lid. Oh...

01:20.160 --> 01:26.030
Good these, aren't they? I had this shipped
from L.A. No one else here has got one.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.800
Looks like a Robin Reliant.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.434
Yes, we're in the kitchen.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.551
It wouldn't be wise to relate it all
to the DNA structure too early.

01:36.760 --> 01:42.278
It's important to keep a demonstration simple,
especially for those listening.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.075
Yes, even though we know it's really
very complicated and difficult.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.151
- Hi. Sorry I'm so late.
- We're just about to have some lunch.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.751
- Massive house!
- Not really. It's just on a lot of floors.

01:54.960 --> 01:59.158
- They're all the same in this area.
- Oh, well Great area.

01:59.360 --> 02:04.275
My mother bought it before it was nice.
Then everybody else started living here.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.790
- Sarah lives just up the road.
- Yes.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.551
Where I live it's just a load of
workman's cottages and council flats.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.513
- Oh, where is that?
- Chelsea.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.998
There's lots of homeless people
living down our street, so...

02:20.200 --> 02:21.792
So, what?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.470
After college I'm going to work
with homeless people.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.549
- I thought you'd be an investment banker.
- Oh, no, no, that's just what Pop wants.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.717
Watch out, Pats, entering a No Fun Zone.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.678
- A coven.
- Mmm...

02:39.880 --> 02:44.192
We're just coming down to get a bit of lunch.
We'll take it back upstairs.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.633
Let's get a little bit of dry bread and a cup
of water and scuttle back upstairs.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.478
Hi, I'm Daniel

02:55.360 --> 02:59.114
- Hello, Daniel
- Danny, hello.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.157
Don't let us disturb you, darling.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.319
Can I offer anyone a drink? Can I, boys?
Danny, can I get you something?

03:09.520 --> 03:12.830
- Yes, thanks, I'll have a Bud.
- A Bud, yeah.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.316
- You?
- Me? Ah... A Bud, please.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.272
Here we go, Danny.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.438
Sisters Grimm, can I tempt you?

03:22.680 --> 03:26.355
- We don't drink, Mum.
- No, I didn't think we drank.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.358
- Champers all right for you, Pats?
- Lovely, sweetie.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.190
Here we go.
# Little bit of champ...

03:32.400 --> 03:36.598
Mum, what are you doing here?
You're hanging around as if you're on holiday.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.237
I know, darling. I've got a lot of time
on my hands. Bubble is doing everything.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.556
- Bubble?
- It's strange, isn't it?

03:43.760 --> 03:46.991
Ever since I sent her to that
occupational hypnotist she's been...

03:47.200 --> 03:49.794
.. well, almost like a PA.
It's extraordinary.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.549
Pats, shall we finish off the Beluga,
or have smoked salmon?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.672
- Whatever, sweetie.
- All right, we'll finish off the Beluga.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.314
Here we go.
# La, la, la...

03:59.520 --> 04:03.195
You all right there with just your
little biscuits and dry cheese?

04:03.400 --> 04:07.075
You can have anything you want, Danny.
Whole house at your disposal

04:07.280 --> 04:10.829
- We're fine. Thank you, Mum.
- We'll just be over here nibbling away.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.077
You won't even know we're here, darling.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.317
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, we understand.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.034
Can we go over how many molecules...

04:20.240 --> 04:23.550
Oh, shh, Pats.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.991
And how many are we going
to reconstruct for the presentation?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.670
- Jane's divorce has come through.
- Oh, thank bloody God.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.838
Now they're fighting over
the Hello.! magazine deal

04:34.040 --> 04:36.600
- What are they offering?
- Darling, peanuts!

04:36.800 --> 04:39.872
Thirty five grand
and she'll throw in the kids as well

04:40.080 --> 04:42.594
It must be worth more than that.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.872
- He's got the dog and the house in L.A.
- He's got the pool, sweetie.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.640
Can you keep it down, please?

04:48.840 --> 04:51.229
Sorry, sweetie. Sorry, darling.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.797
Do you want to hear some gossip
about someone you don't know?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.437
Tell me on the way to the office.
We'd better go, we're getting looks.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.194
Bye-bye, sweetie.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.995
- It's like kissing a spawning sturgeon.
- Just 'cos I like having eggs in my mouth.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.953
The only place she's still got them, eh, Danny?

05:14.600 --> 05:18.673
See you later, sweetie.
Me and my ovaries are leaving.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.750
- Sorry about my mother.
- Oh, she's great.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.517
...she was crying so much I had to hang up.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.676
I'll phone back later
and get the rest of the story.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.677
I'm sure she won't mind that I know.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.348
I'm here, don't panic,
everything under control

05:36.560 --> 05:38.710
I'll just finish signing these.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.515
- You want me to sign a few?
- No, that's it now.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.837
- Have you had lunch?
- Yes, look... We've had lunch.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.636
- I'll get some coffee, wine and champagne.
- Yes, we'll be needing some of that.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.832
Where's all my stuff?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.076
Here we go!

05:56.280 --> 05:58.111
Got it.!

05:58.320 --> 06:01.790
Look through this month's selection
while I prepare your diary.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.596
Diary? I haven't got a diary.
What's she talking about? What's this?

06:06.800 --> 06:11.874
I can't sit here flicking through magazines.
I'm not at the bloody hairdressers.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.957
Call Diane back.
She must have stopped blubbing by now.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.071
No, darling, later. I'm busy, busy.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.034
Shall we have a bitch through
Hello.! magazine and the Enquirer?

06:22.240 --> 06:25.312
Come, on, sweetie.
Catherine Oxenberg, Liz Taylor,

06:25.520 --> 06:28.478
Khashoggi,
Shahpari Khashoggi, darling.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.150
All that money
and she's still got a moustache.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.594
Oh, sweetie, one more face lift
on this one and she'll have a beard.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.479
Why do we think Pricilla Presley wears gloves?

06:41.680 --> 06:44.194
- Oh, I don't know.
- Liver spots, don't you remember?

06:44.400 --> 06:47.949
Where's Bubble? What's happening here?
What is it? What's happening?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.869
I'll just go through a few of the things
in this week's diary.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.392
Charity: Emporio Armani, drinks,
lunch, launch, Gucci opening.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.512
Invites for fashion shows:
Westwood, Hamnett, Jackson, Richmond.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.598
I said yes to all You can do Westwood.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.199
Party, party, party, party...

07:04.400 --> 07:08.279
Koo Stark is having a retrospective
of work she has yet to do.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.835
That'll be drinks and a press call

07:11.040 --> 07:16.353
Book launches:
1 Bill Wyman's Coping With Cystitis.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.994
Press call and ribs at Sticky Fingers.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.191
Party, party, party, movie meetings.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.632
2 Paula Yates, her book
If I Can't Have A Career Why Should They.?

07:25.840 --> 07:29.435
There will be a party
and she will be expressing milk throughout.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.312
Oh, I'm not going to that.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.080
Linda McCartney, Joan Collins,
Emma Freud, Marie Helvin,

07:34.280 --> 07:37.716
Ivana Trump,
the launch of her new perfume

07:37.920 --> 07:41.356
The Smell That lingers longer Than He Does.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.870
- Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York, Paris...
- Did Bruce call?.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.153
Just for a chat, so I had the chat.
Nothing worth you bothering with.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.954
The rest is all bottom of the league stuff.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.950
Esther Rantzen, Simon Bates,
Christopher Tarrant, Amanda de Cadenet.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.993
- Your car is here.
- Right, gotta dash.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.998
I'm on my mobile if you want me.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.837
I'm sort of surplus to my own life now,
aren't I, sweetie?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.438
- Hello. Hello, Saffron, sweetie.
- Hi.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.156
If you come round tomorrow we'll have
one more day before the presentation.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.034
- The what, darling?
- It doesn't matter, Mum.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.279
Don't let her talk to you like that, Eddy.
Tell her she's adopted.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.590
- What?
- Doesn't matter, sweetie.

08:33.799 --> 08:38.032
Excuse me, can I just do something
that's really been irritating me.

08:38.240 --> 08:43.519
You can't tell Patsy about arranging balls.
She was always very good at genetics.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.679
I'm not surprised. She's been
a walking sperm bank most of her life.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.237
- Oh, well, I must be off.
- Oh, no, we'll leave the room, darling.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.399
- We're just friends.
- Bye.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.156
Bye, Pats.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.718
- Can I help you with your molecules?
- No, please don't touch them.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.831
Don't touch them...

09:13.560 --> 09:17.189
- We could be friends, darling.
- I've got friends.

09:17.400 --> 09:21.473
You can't mean those little bits of lichen
you had sitting round here today.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.036
Good God, when I think of the schools
that I sent you to.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.153
The interesting and creative people
you could be with if you had stayed at them.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.874
Bedales, for God's sake!

09:32.080 --> 09:35.470
But you had to send yourself off
to your little local grammar.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.478
People don't get more interesting
the more money you lay out.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.319
They do, darling. Fact of life.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.439
- Why can't you just rebel, for God's sake?
- I thought I was.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.997
I mean, you and your little gremlin
generation here, I mean, honestly.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.715
What are you ever going to leave the world?
What will your legacy be?

09:55.920 --> 09:57.672
It won't be anything original, like us.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.474
What did you leave?
The lava lamp and the bean bag?

10:00.680 --> 10:03.990
Oh, a very little uptight person talking.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.919
I don't want to loll around naked,
painted dayglow,

10:07.120 --> 10:11.432
with a flower stuck in every orifice,
humping the air to Jefferson Airplane.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.632
It was the Grateful Dead, darling.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.593
- How is it at school, darling?
- I'm not at school anymore.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.392
Aren't you?

10:27.680 --> 10:31.355
- No, I'm at the sixth form college.
- Oh, the sixth form college.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.916
Is that a different place, darling?

10:35.120 --> 10:38.157
- A different part of the building.
- Oh, a different part of the building.

10:44.280 --> 10:48.193
- This project you're doing, darling...
- Mum, don't get involved.

10:48.400 --> 10:52.393
- I'm your mother, I'm interested.
- No, you're not, you're bored.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.113
I want to know!

10:54.320 --> 10:59.189
It's a DNA project that we present at the open
day as part of our term work. All right?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.831
Open day?

11:02.040 --> 11:06.909
Open day, darling, is that what you said,
at your sixth school form college?

11:07.120 --> 11:09.873
- Don't start.
- What day, darling?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.719
- You're not coming.
- I am.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.229
- Mum, please don't.
- You have to let me, darling.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.908
I don't want you there.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.238
Oh... Oh... I see.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.149
Oh, forget it. Forget it.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.679
I just can't quite bloody believe
the way you bloody treat me sometimes.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.793
I go out of my way to make life
so bloody buggery wonderful, darling.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.231
There isn't anything I wouldn't
let you do, darling.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.992
But, oh, no, I'm not allowed to come
to bloody poly-wollege open day, am I?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.279
Hmm?

11:51.760 --> 11:56.515
Be nice to Mama, sweetie. Hmm?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.718
Darling, think what I could do for you, sweetie.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.434
I could get some T-shirts made,
for the presentation.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.155
With DLA Project on them, couldn't I, darling?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.918
Video screens?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.156
- Catering? What do you want?
- Nothing.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.635
I'll buy the Pollege a bloody swimming pool!

12:13.840 --> 12:15.831
You're not coming and that is an end to it.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.871
- I am.
- You're not.

12:38.680 --> 12:42.229
I want to come! I want to come!

12:50.520 --> 12:53.751
Right, sweetheart,
I'm going to my isolation tank now.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.110
I may be some time. I could sink.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.515
Not with your ballast.

13:02.880 --> 13:07.908
Right. I'm going upstairs to take some pills
and I'm going to kill myself.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.633
- Let me know how many.
- I will

13:09.840 --> 13:13.355
- So I don't call the ambulance too soon.
- Good thinking.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.512
Sweetie...

13:24.720 --> 13:28.872
If you don't let me come,
I'll adopt a Romanian baby.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.633
- I would.
- Mum, don't be so stupid.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.515
No, I would, darling.
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

13:39.480 --> 13:42.677
I'll ask Patsy how you'd go about it, shall I?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.472
Shall I?

13:44.680 --> 13:47.478
- Forcing me to do this now, darling?
- No.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.558
Wonder what they look like, Romanians.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.148
I'll ask Patsy, shall I?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.271
Oh, Danny, is Patsy there?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.396
Pats, darling, look, tell me,
what do Romanians look like?

14:00.600 --> 14:03.558
Ivan Lendl Oh, that'll be nice.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.519
- Thanks, Pats.
- Mum, you wouldn't dare.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.349
- They're in desperate need, I hear.
- This is a really sick idea.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.757
A little baby... That would give me
something to do, sweetie.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.838
- They wouldn't let you.
- I could be like Mia Farrow.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.758
I could have more than one.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.349
I always regretted not getting
a Vietnamese one.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.916
But now I could have one in every colour,
one in every room.

14:26.120 --> 14:31.035
- It would last a day.
- What a selfish little person talking now.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.676
- I wonder how you do go about it.
- You probably have to go to Romania.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.634
Don't be stupid.
I'm sure they could send over a selection.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.879
I'll ask Bubble, shall I?
Get Bubble on to it, darling?

14:44.080 --> 14:47.072
- Mum, you're not going to do this.
- I am.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.033
- Well, go on then. Go on then.
- Huh?

14:55.240 --> 14:59.836
Bubble, if you've got a second,
could you adopt me a Romanian baby?

15:00.040 --> 15:01.996
Oh, you could. Oh, good.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.034
No, just send over a selection
and I'll pick one. All right, thank you.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.356
Happy? Huh?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.798
Huh?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.470
Be nice, wouldn't it, sweetie?
Little baby.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.836
# La, la, la, little baby.
Being a mummy again. I'd like that.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.472
Bubble, Bubble?

15:32.680 --> 15:34.796
What do you mean, she's not taking calls?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.195
Don't you dare put me on hold!

15:37.920 --> 15:40.036
Oh, shit...

15:41.480 --> 15:43.198
Pats, Pats, emergency!

15:43.920 --> 15:45.751
- Where is she?
- Where is the little tapeworm?

15:45.960 --> 15:49.555
You can't just walk in like that.
I might have to call security.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.116
You'll be calling yourself an ambulance soon.
Where is she?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.790
- Let me smack her in the gob!
- I'll do that in a minute. Where is she?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.719
- She went to New York.
- Did she leave a number? Anything?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.990
I don't know. She does everything.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.475
Did she leave a Romanian number?
A clue? Something?

16:04.680 --> 16:09.959
The Romanian deal went through
and the merchandise is on its way.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.752
Get out!

16:17.880 --> 16:21.953
It can't happen that quickly, can it, Pats?
I mean, can it?

16:23.080 --> 16:27.278
I mean, shit. I don't want any babies.
I didn't really want my own babies.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.438
It was quite a nice idea at the time,
but, Jesus...

16:30.640 --> 16:33.313
They make you think about somebody else
the whole bloody time.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.830
- Nightmare, sweetie.
- I know.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.511
Don't tell them I said that, darling.
I do sort of quite love them now.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.759
- Of course you do.
- Yeah. I don't want any more, darling.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.396
I'll send them back.
I'll be able to send them back, sweetie, won't I?

16:49.600 --> 16:52.160
Sell them on.
Mark them up and sell them on.

16:56.120 --> 17:01.069
- Oh, God... Bloody office.
- Calm down, sweetie. Come on in.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.159
Throw a couple of these down you and
everything will look much rosier, darling.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.794
Oh, my God, there's something horrible
on the stairs.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.468
- It's me.
- I'm not blind.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.114
- What are those pills?
- Don't question me.

17:13.319 --> 17:17.438
Darling, they're just hormones,
so I can breastfeed the Romanians.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.868
- I'm off. See you tomorrow, darling.
- Ten o'clock at Mothercare, Pats.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.833
- Mum, you can stop it now.
- Stop what, darling?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.678
You can stop pretending.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.874
I don't believe for a second you'd go through
with this adoption just to get at me.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.719
So you can come to the presentation.
I don't mind.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.309
All right, then.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.556
- This is where we hug.
- Oh, sorry, sweetie.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.350
- I mean, Romanian babies...
- I know. Silly, isn't it?

17:45.560 --> 17:49.599
On two conditions: never embarrass me
beyond what is obviously unavoidable.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.873
- And don't get involved in the college.
- I don't want to.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.189
Romanian babies...

18:03.560 --> 18:05.949
- Do you want a car or something?
- No.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.798
No? All right.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.230
- A little self-contained flat somewhere?
- No.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.110
I do love you, darling, you know that.
Despite what anyone like Patsy might say.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.390
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetie.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.997
Oh, shit!

18:51.080 --> 18:55.870
- Do you know where it is?
- I think it's down here, dear.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.273
Still no word from Bubble.

19:01.280 --> 19:06.798
I'm really rather nervous.
Why? No one will look at you.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.072
Something about the smell of schools.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.956
You've probably forgotten the number of times
I was summoned by your headmistress

19:15.200 --> 19:18.636
for your smoking or rudeness or truancy.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.035
We weren't truant, were we, Pats?

19:21.240 --> 19:25.916
Believe me, I think I spent more time
at your school in that last year

19:26.120 --> 19:30.671
than either one of you.
How much further is it?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.560
- Sexy smell, isn't it?
- Pats!

19:35.760 --> 19:40.550
Takes you back.
Testosterone mixed with cheap perfume.

19:40.760 --> 19:44.548
Biros and folders and your first condom,
which you hide in your desk

19:44.760 --> 19:47.035
with your Lucky Strikes
and your Dr White's.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.959
- Fabulous days.
- Fabulous days, Eddy.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.755
- There's Saffy.
- Hello, darling. Look at Mum.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.554
- Where's the show?
- It's not a show, it's a presentation.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.593
- I need a drink. Where's the bar?
- Darling, there isn't a bar.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.392
- Is there?
- No.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.750
- What's the talk about, dear?
- DNA.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.272
Should that mean anything to me, dear?
Oh, good, as long as I know.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.870
- Saffron, is this your mother?
- No, this is my gran.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.152
- This is my mother.
- Oh, pleased to meet you.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.512
The headmaster has asked me
to round up a few parents to meet him.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.872
We've got time before the presentation,
if you'd like to come with me.

20:24.080 --> 20:28.232
- Can I bring my friend?
- Yes, of course. Follow me.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.318
Going to see the headmaster, sweetie.
Headmaster.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.636
I've told him you're here.
He won't keep you a moment.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.956
Thank you, Mr Johnson.

20:47.080 --> 20:51.710
- Put that fag out.
- Why? I don't care. It's only a college.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.595
- What does he want to see us about?
- It's you he wants to see, not me.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.196
Can I help you? What are you doing here?

20:59.400 --> 21:03.632
- Just waiting to see Miss Dines.
- Take that cigarette out, Patricia Stone.

21:03.840 --> 21:08.038
You disgusting little girl
You two make me sick.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.199
- Oh, God, I hate him!
- Just stand here quietly, Pats.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.153
- Here. Go on!
- No, I don't smoke...

21:18.840 --> 21:21.035
- What does she want to see us about?
- I don't know.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.630
Don't you dare say anything
about me and Tony.

21:26.680 --> 21:30.229
You know who you look like?
Cathy McGowan.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.910
- Do I?
- Really pretty, just like her.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.718
- You look like Marianne Faithful
- Do I?

21:37.920 --> 21:40.480
Come in, now.!

21:52.160 --> 21:55.948
You dirty,

21:56.160 --> 21:59.948
dirty, dirty,

22:00.160 --> 22:03.516
disgusting, revolting,

22:03.720 --> 22:05.551
devil children!

22:05.760 --> 22:08.433
They're the ones having it off, not me!

22:20.640 --> 22:23.154
- Patsy!
- Tony?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.754
Edwina.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.439
- Sherry?
- Oh, wow, Tony!

22:49.440 --> 22:51.112
Hello, sweetie.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.358
We're waiting for Mr Simms
to do the introduction speech.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.835
All right, then. Do you want this?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.277
Sorry, sweetie.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.873
Right, sorry to be delayed.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.868
- Now, what is it you're giving us?
- DNA.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.834
DNA. Well, take it away.

23:24.200 --> 23:28.796
Upper 6J have been doing a variety
of science-based projects this year,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.310
not all of them curriculum-based.

23:32.520 --> 23:38.755
This term we've been looking
at deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.520
DNA is composed of two
intertwined strands...

23:41.720 --> 23:43.472
Sorry, may I interrupt?

23:43.680 --> 23:46.877
There's someone here to see
a Mrs Edina Monsoon?

23:48.160 --> 23:52.551
Sorry, sweetie.
Just carry on, I don't mind.

23:54.240 --> 24:00.588
Two intertwined strands, each consisting
of a linear sequence of nucleotides.

24:00.800 --> 24:05.715
Genes are the fundamental units
of genetic information that corresponds

24:05.920 --> 24:09.959
to the sequence of nucleotides
in a segment of DNA.

24:10.160 --> 24:14.950
A typical gene consists of many
hundreds of thousands of nucleotides

24:15.160 --> 24:17.071
of which only a few are shown here.

24:17.280 --> 24:21.034
Daniel is now going to show
how the genetic information

24:21.240 --> 24:26.837
on a specific sequence of nucleotides
corresponds to the sequence

24:27.040 --> 24:31.750
of a portion of the amino acids
in the polypeptide chain.

24:31.960 --> 24:37.114
Mum, Mum... Miss you too.
Shh...

24:37.320 --> 24:40.676
This process is known as protein duplication.

24:44.680 --> 24:49.310
- Right, that's it. Get out! Just get out!
- I didn't want them. I cancelled them.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.829
I cancelled them. I didn't want them.

24:52.040 --> 24:55.669
- I hope you'll come to all open days.
- I don't want to.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.270
- And become an active PTA member.
- I don't want to.

24:59.480 --> 25:04.235
I don't want to see the foundation
of the general studies room.

25:05.080 --> 25:09.039
Oh, God. I don't want to see
your bloody foundation. Oh, no.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.279
I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm dead. I'm dead.
Oooh...

25:13.480 --> 25:17.758
You're just having a little bad dream.
I must have knocked the lid shut.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.956
- How long have I been in there, Pats?
- About thirty seconds.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.156
They're quite good then, aren't they?

25:32.360 --> 25:36.035
If you're the kind of girl who likes
lying around in a warm puddle.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.073
Hang on, I've just got to check something.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.995
Bubble, listen, what is your job?

25:46.200 --> 25:49.397
- What's me what?
- What is it you do, darling?

25:49.600 --> 25:54.913
I don't really know. Nothing. Get paid.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.156
Good.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.235
Yes, they're good, aren't they?
I had to have it imported from L.A.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.955
- No one over here's got one.
- I heard Fergie had one.

26:07.160 --> 26:11.199
No. Oh, God, I have to get rid of it now.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.511
- Morning, Saffron, sweetie.
- Morning.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.594
- Danny here yet?
- Danny who?

26:24.560 --> 26:27.313
I thought that bit was too good to be true.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.956
- Mum?
- Sweetie?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.993
You're not coming to the open day, are you?

26:37.240 --> 26:38.832
No.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.919
I'll be too busy.
You know me, work, work, work.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.795
- So, a bit of shopping this morning?
- Can we go to Yamishi's new shop?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.718
- Have you seen it?
- Gorgeous window.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.196
Great huge swathe of white chiffon
and terracotta pots.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.279
- What does he sell?.
- Terracotta pots, white chiffon...

26:57.480 --> 26:59.072
Maybe both, I don't know.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.989
I have to fit in a high colonic
and a body wax before then.

27:03.200 --> 27:07.432
Let's go now and we can discuss
Jane Fonda's tits on the way. Shall we go?

27:07.640 --> 27:10.837
I hear she can wear
them as Micky Mouse ears now.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.156
- You want to hear a new joke, darling?
- Oh, yeah.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.476
- It's not in very good taste.
- No.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.830
The thing is this...
You know Elizabeth Taylor.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.874
I hear that she is the new ride
at Disney World.
