01:22.514 --> 01:23.682
[Luschek] Hey.

01:24.891 --> 01:27.937
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.314
Luschek, what the hell?

01:30.397 --> 01:31.856
You're needed in electrical.

01:31.941 --> 01:34.818
Man, it's not even my shift.

01:34.901 --> 01:36.028
It's an emergency.

01:36.111 --> 01:37.112
Excuse me.

01:37.196 --> 01:39.073
We're in the middle of a session here.

01:39.156 --> 01:41.325
You can get back to your
flower bondage in a second.

01:41.408 --> 01:43.327
And quit topping from the bottom.

01:43.410 --> 01:44.661
Meet me outside.

01:44.744 --> 01:46.038
[Nicky] All right. All right.

01:46.121 --> 01:48.790
Just give me a minute, all right? Fuck.

01:51.668 --> 01:52.752
What was that about?

01:52.836 --> 01:55.589
Ah, the people are praying
for rain and mattresses.

01:55.672 --> 01:57.049
- Idiots.
- [snorts]

01:57.132 --> 01:59.927
All right, listen, I, uh... I found a guy.

02:00.010 --> 02:01.678
Well, it's about time.

02:01.761 --> 02:04.723
Hmm. All my dealers are
too righteous to sell H,

02:04.806 --> 02:06.850
but this guy's perfect.

02:06.934 --> 02:10.062
You know, this biker from Coxsackie.

02:10.145 --> 02:12.689
Total scumbag. Married my sister.

02:12.772 --> 02:15.692
Look, there's been a little
hitch in our giddy up.

02:15.775 --> 02:18.612
- What?
- There's no more giddy up.

02:18.695 --> 02:20.655
- Why not?
- It's not where we left it.

02:21.698 --> 02:22.818
Somebody must have stole it.

02:23.414 --> 02:25.302
God... God damn it.

02:25.327 --> 02:26.495
- Keep it down.
- I knew it.

02:26.578 --> 02:28.580
I knew I couldn't trust
you. I'm giving you a shot.

02:29.331 --> 02:31.375
For not giving you heroin?

02:32.084 --> 02:33.335
Actions have consequences.

02:33.418 --> 02:35.129
- And I got my sister involved.
- Come on!

02:35.212 --> 02:36.380
All right, she already
thinks I'm unreliable.

02:36.463 --> 02:37.881
This was gonna be a big win for me.

02:37.965 --> 02:39.508
Wait.

02:39.591 --> 02:41.218
What did you mean by "we"?

02:41.301 --> 02:42.344
What?

02:42.427 --> 02:44.013
You said, "Where we left it."

02:44.096 --> 02:45.305
Oh, yeah, me and Boo.

02:45.389 --> 02:47.724
I'm about to give you
another shot for being stupid.

02:47.807 --> 02:49.851
No, no, no, man. It's not her.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.687
I don't think. [stammers]
I mean, I don't know.

02:52.771 --> 02:56.108
This place is lousy with
thieves, so could be anyone.

02:56.191 --> 02:58.402
Well, thanks for getting
my fucking hopes up.

02:58.485 --> 03:00.612
You know, that's why you
women ended up in prison.

03:00.695 --> 03:02.156
'Cause you suck at crime.

03:02.239 --> 03:03.240
[sighs]

03:03.323 --> 03:07.036
Look at this fucking street, all
fro-yo marts and clothes for homos.

03:07.119 --> 03:09.329
Well, you're gonna miss all
these yogurt and fag shops

03:09.413 --> 03:12.791
when they turn it all into banks and
luxury condos for foreign investors.

03:12.874 --> 03:14.626
- Yo!
- He's out.

03:14.709 --> 03:16.628
What? The fuck?

03:16.711 --> 03:18.713
I texted Isaac, and he said we can cop,

03:18.797 --> 03:21.591
but he's leaving in 10 minutes and
he's all the way up on 79th and Third.

03:21.675 --> 03:23.385
- We're screwed.
- Fuck. All right, no.

03:23.468 --> 03:26.180
Do not be fucking negative
right now, all right?

03:26.263 --> 03:28.265
I'm not going the weekend without dope.

03:28.348 --> 03:30.642
Clear eyes, full hearts, right?

03:30.725 --> 03:31.726
[all] Can't lose.

03:31.810 --> 03:32.852
Hey!

03:32.877 --> 03:34.253
Hey, buddy!

03:34.563 --> 03:37.607
Hey! Uptown? Yo, buddy!

03:37.691 --> 03:39.651
- What the fuck?
- Asshole.

03:39.734 --> 03:42.279
In the old days, they'd
at least say, "Fuck off."

03:42.362 --> 03:44.899
What old days? You moved
here in, like, 2007.

03:47.534 --> 03:48.535
Let's take it.

03:48.618 --> 03:49.786
- What?
- Come on.

03:49.869 --> 03:51.955
Look, the keys are in the ignition.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.481
- Let's take it.
- Are you nuts?

03:53.623 --> 03:56.251
You wanna go cop in the fucking
projects? Come on. Get in.

03:58.337 --> 03:59.421
Fucking hell, man.

04:04.301 --> 04:06.220
- [tires screeching]
- Ow!

04:06.303 --> 04:07.512
What the fuck?

04:07.596 --> 04:10.099
- Where'd you learn to drive?
- [car alarms beeping]

04:10.182 --> 04:12.476
Maybe I didn't. I grew up in the city.

04:12.559 --> 04:14.353
[man] Come on, move it
over. [woman] Get moving!

04:14.378 --> 04:15.379
- [man] Come on! Move along!
- Fuck!

04:15.520 --> 04:17.147
[moaning]

04:17.172 --> 04:18.298
Wait.

04:19.649 --> 04:20.942
We shouldn't be on the floor.

04:21.024 --> 04:22.861
There might still be bedbugs.

04:22.944 --> 04:24.779
Then we'll both get them.

04:24.863 --> 04:27.949
So long as we're in it
together. Isn't that your thing?

04:28.032 --> 04:29.659
You don't have to be here right now.

04:29.684 --> 04:31.811
Um, I do, actually, because of you.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.796
I meant... in the library,

04:33.821 --> 04:35.907
and I don't wanna fucking
talk about that anymore.

04:35.932 --> 04:39.144
Well, you have to...
because it makes me angry,

04:39.461 --> 04:41.838
and at least when I'm angry...

04:41.921 --> 04:45.842
I have enough gas in the tank to fuck
you like you deserve to be fucked.

04:45.925 --> 04:46.926
[Piper] Mmm.

04:47.010 --> 04:48.720
That's hot.

04:48.803 --> 04:49.971
Yeah, it is fucking hot.

04:50.054 --> 04:51.556
[gasping and moaning]

04:51.581 --> 04:56.860
You controlling... selfish...
bourgeois piece of shit.

04:59.564 --> 05:02.025
- Turn over.
- What?

05:02.942 --> 05:04.403
Why?

05:04.486 --> 05:06.488
Because I can't stand to look at you.

05:06.513 --> 05:07.681
But you can fuck me?

05:07.706 --> 05:09.686
Yeah, maybe if you learn
to shut the fuck up!

05:11.660 --> 05:14.954
You guys, I'm not even getting
out for another three years.

05:15.038 --> 05:16.873
So? That doesn't mean you
shouldn't start planning.

05:16.956 --> 05:19.668
You need to pick a dress, find
an awesome DJ, book a hall.

05:19.751 --> 05:21.336
[gasps] I know the dopest DJ.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.587
- Ay, sí.
- He mostly does dubstep,

05:22.671 --> 05:24.631
but I'm sure he can find a
version of the wedding song.

05:24.714 --> 05:26.550
But I don't even know I
wanna make it some big thing

05:26.633 --> 05:28.193
or just go down to the courthouse, so...

05:28.260 --> 05:29.886
- [gasps] Oh, my God, gross.
- Ay, what?

05:29.969 --> 05:31.263
- Hey, Daya, come on.
- No.

05:31.346 --> 05:33.097
A person only gets married
once or twice in her life,

05:33.182 --> 05:34.724
so go big or go really big.

05:34.808 --> 05:36.435
Yeah, and it's not just about you.

05:36.518 --> 05:39.271
- It's about all your family
and friends. - Mmm-hmm.

05:39.354 --> 05:41.523
- I love a wedding party.
- I know. Me, too.

05:41.606 --> 05:43.775
Yeah, what makes you
think she wants you there?

05:43.858 --> 05:47.391
Ay, Dios. What do you mean? Of
course she does. We're family, right?

05:47.416 --> 05:50.127
- Yeah, of course.
- "Of course."

05:50.557 --> 05:51.599
Of course.

05:51.825 --> 05:53.545
Here's what's gonna
happen when you get out.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.287
You'll call each other up...

05:56.496 --> 05:59.708
maybe meet for drinks, make
more plans but then cancel them,

05:59.791 --> 06:04.879
push them off, you're suddenly really busy.

06:04.963 --> 06:07.216
But the truth is...

06:07.299 --> 06:09.739
you're avoiding each other
because it only took that one drink

06:09.759 --> 06:13.388
for you to realize you don't
have anything in common...

06:13.413 --> 06:17.333
and all you got was a reminder of the
time you spent in this fucking hellhole.

06:18.437 --> 06:19.979
We're not a family.

06:20.679 --> 06:22.181
We're a BAND-AID...

06:22.599 --> 06:25.686
and once you rip it off, all
we are to each other is scars.

06:25.817 --> 06:27.193
Ay, whatever.

06:27.277 --> 06:29.238
She's just being a bitch
because she can't see her baby.

06:29.321 --> 06:31.698
So look, you, like, get
out in 36 months, right?

06:31.781 --> 06:32.824
[Dayanara] Mmm-hmm.

06:32.907 --> 06:34.326
- [gasps] Yeah!
- That's, like, around summer.

06:34.409 --> 06:37.579
- [gasps] A summer wedding! Perfect!
- Yeah!

06:37.662 --> 06:40.457
Except, I don't get out till next fall.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.376
A fall wedding could be nice, too.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.278
- Or winter. Winter 2016.
- [gasps]

06:44.303 --> 06:46.023
- Or 17. Better count. One, two...
- Ay, sí.

06:46.212 --> 06:48.840
[Caputo] "Represents the
warden at meetings and

06:48.923 --> 06:50.342
- orientation of new staff."
- [knocking on door]

06:50.425 --> 06:52.386
- Sir?
- Oh, I, um...

06:52.469 --> 06:55.555
Yeah. I just, uh...

06:55.639 --> 06:58.141
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- No, I was...

06:58.224 --> 06:59.518
I was just, um...

07:00.935 --> 07:02.312
What can I do for you?

07:02.979 --> 07:05.023
I wanted to talk to you.

07:05.106 --> 07:07.108
I heard a rumor that the camp's closing.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.279
Where'd you hear that? From who? I...

07:10.362 --> 07:12.572
Uh, my boy down the hill at...

07:12.656 --> 07:13.740
Is it true?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.077
Look, I don't want to start a panic.

07:18.995 --> 07:20.038
So it's true?

07:20.121 --> 07:21.998
No... I didn't say that.

07:22.081 --> 07:24.121
I just said I don't want
to start a panic. I just...

07:24.125 --> 07:27.379
[scoffs] But why would we panic
unless the camp's shutting down?

07:27.462 --> 07:31.591
Uh, there are many reasons why
a person may choose to panic.

07:31.675 --> 07:35.219
Sharks, school shootings,
uh, bee extinction.

07:35.244 --> 07:36.995
They call it colony collapse,

07:37.080 --> 07:40.501
and they say it's all from
this Monsanto pesticide.

07:40.642 --> 07:41.643
It's horrible.

07:41.726 --> 07:44.062
I just want to know if there's
anything I should be doing for...

07:44.145 --> 07:45.145
There's not.

07:46.064 --> 07:47.441
So I can have some notice.

07:47.524 --> 07:48.858
[sighs]

07:50.735 --> 07:52.737
If you lose your job,
you'll be the first to know.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.019
All right, sir.

07:56.408 --> 07:57.784
Thank you.

07:59.619 --> 08:00.912
Thanks for stopping by.

08:00.995 --> 08:03.247
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

08:04.291 --> 08:07.669
What the fucking shit?

08:09.128 --> 08:10.129
[Frieda] What?

08:10.213 --> 08:12.006
People want privacy.

08:12.090 --> 08:18.722
If we can grow the corn high enough, we
can rent out a field like a motel room.

08:19.723 --> 08:22.266
I mean, we gotta do something
now that we're sewn shut.

08:22.351 --> 08:25.144
We are doing something. We're gardening.

08:25.228 --> 08:30.442
I did not join this club to smuggle
contraband or to shank people.

08:30.525 --> 08:34.236
I joined it to garden, to make things grow.

08:34.904 --> 08:37.573
Hey! Is that our wheelbarrow?

08:37.657 --> 08:40.827
It's the prison's. I can use it.

08:40.909 --> 08:44.080
You can use it and you can return it.

08:44.163 --> 08:45.707
- [sighs]
- [Irma] Did you hear me?

08:45.790 --> 08:49.794
I just want to enjoy the simple things.

08:49.878 --> 08:51.838
And you can...

08:51.921 --> 08:56.092
while we also rent out
the cornfield for sex.

08:57.218 --> 09:00.847
[Healy] Nothing like being down
on your hands and knees, huh?

09:00.930 --> 09:02.766
[stammers] In the soil.

09:02.849 --> 09:04.601
Nice to be outside is what I meant.

09:04.684 --> 09:07.562
- How are you, Sam?
- Good. [sighs]

09:08.480 --> 09:09.689
Better.

09:11.025 --> 09:13.987
- Listen, uh, about the other day...
- It's all right.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.972
- Well, things got a little personal.
- It's fine.

09:16.029 --> 09:18.322
I just don't want it to be awkward.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.492
It's not.

09:20.575 --> 09:22.786
Well, it is now.

09:22.869 --> 09:24.746
Next time something awkward happens,

09:24.829 --> 09:27.837
try not drawing extra attention to it, huh?

09:29.543 --> 09:31.127
How's it going?

09:31.210 --> 09:32.504
[sighs]

09:32.529 --> 09:34.157
Not so good, actually.

09:35.063 --> 09:36.064
Not so good.

09:36.257 --> 09:40.136
Remember what I said about
a corpse being a corpse.

09:40.219 --> 09:43.973
I just want this corpse to be sleeping
in the same bed with me, that's all.

09:44.974 --> 09:47.977
I feel the language gap is still a problem.

09:48.616 --> 09:49.742
[sighs]

09:51.934 --> 09:53.561
Healy...

09:56.778 --> 09:58.863
I can't be your marriage counselor.

09:58.947 --> 10:02.492
Translator... for an hour
or so, tonight, after dinner.

10:02.576 --> 10:05.161
- Oh, no, I think I have plans.
- No, you don't.

10:05.244 --> 10:06.663
I cleared your schedule.

10:06.746 --> 10:07.789
Oh.

10:07.814 --> 10:09.190
Well, in that case...

10:09.332 --> 10:12.586
Thanks, Red. It's very kind of you.

10:12.669 --> 10:14.629
You basically gave me no choice.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.591
Even so... I appreciate it.

10:23.888 --> 10:26.516
Are you sure you're okay?
Looks like someone hit you.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.935
It's from when I was in holding.

10:29.807 --> 10:31.058
What about your neck?

10:31.927 --> 10:34.138
There's a... little mark here.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.069
[chuckles]

10:39.095 --> 10:40.935
I must have checked my
pulse a little too hard.

10:41.385 --> 10:42.907
Is my work assignment in?

10:42.991 --> 10:45.243
No, I don't give assignments
till I get to know you.

10:45.326 --> 10:47.537
- I was just here.
- But I wasn't.

10:47.621 --> 10:50.081
But better late than never, right?

10:50.164 --> 10:52.626
Hey, I'm teaching a drama
class later. You coming?

10:52.709 --> 10:53.989
Mmm, that's not really my thing.

10:54.002 --> 10:55.962
Oh, come on. I think it'll be good for you.

10:56.045 --> 10:57.881
How do you know what's good for me?

10:57.964 --> 10:59.173
You just met me.

11:00.467 --> 11:03.261
Look, Vause, I get it. I get the anger.

11:03.344 --> 11:06.139
When a country has more inmates
than teachers or engineers,

11:06.222 --> 11:07.807
we are living in a fucked up society.

11:07.891 --> 11:09.976
- Prison is bullshit.
- [chuckling]

11:10.059 --> 11:11.520
Then why work in one?

11:12.436 --> 11:15.774
Because I think there are people here
with potential that's being squandered

11:15.857 --> 11:18.943
- and I wanna make a...
- Oh, you wanna make a difference?

11:19.944 --> 11:22.697
Yeah, I get it. You're
one of the good guys.

11:23.953 --> 11:25.705
But guess what.

11:25.741 --> 11:28.076
We all think we're good guys.

11:28.411 --> 11:29.691
I used to work for a drug dealer

11:29.704 --> 11:31.247
who wouldn't hesitate to
put a bullet in your head

11:31.330 --> 11:34.793
if you crossed him, or if you
stopped being useful to him,

11:34.876 --> 11:38.087
but in his mind, he's
still a good guy. [laughing]

11:39.696 --> 11:41.823
Heroin Robin Hood...

11:41.848 --> 11:45.310
because he cut out the Mexican cartels
and passed on the savings to the consumer,

11:45.600 --> 11:47.280
and he never cut his shit with brick dust.

11:49.724 --> 11:51.044
And you're not just another shill

11:51.059 --> 11:53.895
taking a paycheck from an
evil system of oppression,

11:53.978 --> 11:57.607
'cause you're fighting it from
the inside with drama class.

11:58.524 --> 12:03.196
Fine. Whatever you need
to tell yourself to get by.

12:03.279 --> 12:05.824
But excuse me if I don't
want to spend my precious time

12:05.907 --> 12:09.410
catering to the delusion that
you're making a difference.

12:09.493 --> 12:12.038
I have my own quilt of lies to sew.

12:12.747 --> 12:15.249
That is a great speech.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.086
Now, I would love to hear you
give it again in drama class.

12:24.759 --> 12:26.510
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

12:27.553 --> 12:29.138
I get really hot down here.

12:29.806 --> 12:31.766
Well, nothing I haven't seen before.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.471
I'm leaving now... but it's
not because of... [sighs]

12:37.897 --> 12:39.065
I was gonna leave anyway.

12:39.148 --> 12:40.984
All right.

12:41.901 --> 12:45.529
Like, you just happened to come in
here right before I was about to leave.

12:45.554 --> 12:46.971
[Nicky] Great story.

12:49.618 --> 12:50.952
Okay. Goodbye.

12:51.035 --> 12:52.704
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

13:15.518 --> 13:17.561
- Can I ask you a question, though?
- What?

13:17.646 --> 13:19.272
Why don't you talk to me?

13:19.355 --> 13:21.149
[groans] All right, what?

13:21.232 --> 13:24.193
I mean, we were intimate.

13:24.277 --> 13:25.737
And I understand that

13:25.820 --> 13:28.364
we are never gonna be, like,
girlfriend-girlfriend or whatever,

13:28.447 --> 13:32.368
but I thought, you know, maybe
you'd at least be friendly...

13:32.451 --> 13:33.828
civil.

13:33.912 --> 13:35.163
You thought that?

13:35.246 --> 13:36.665
Yeah.

13:36.748 --> 13:39.167
And when do you have time to think
when you're constantly talking?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.251
Yabba yammer.

13:41.335 --> 13:42.879
Oh.

13:42.962 --> 13:45.674
Wow. I guess that answers
that question. [scoffs]

13:46.758 --> 13:50.469
You use people and you throw them away.

13:50.553 --> 13:52.931
That's your thing. Now I know.

13:53.014 --> 13:56.309
Hey, Soso! That's not my thing, all right?

13:56.392 --> 14:00.354
[shouting] I look out for my friends.
You just don't happen to be one of them.

14:00.438 --> 14:02.148
[scoffs]

14:02.231 --> 14:03.649
[Marka] You want me to do what?

14:03.733 --> 14:06.736
We can't leave them in jail, all right?
I'm responsible for this, sort of.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.322
- I thought you said this wasn't your idea.
- [scoffs]

14:09.405 --> 14:11.950
I'm not going to argue with you the
micro-details of who did what, okay?

14:12.033 --> 14:13.284
I'm not gonna leave my friends in there.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.494
I'm not giving you anymore money, Nicky.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.371
Thank God they didn't
find any drugs on you.

14:17.455 --> 14:18.456
Praise the Lord.

14:18.539 --> 14:20.750
'Cause getting caught with drugs
is so much worse than, uh...

14:20.834 --> 14:22.626
grand theft auto in the eyes of the law.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.231
Doesn't that make a fuckload of sense?

14:24.253 --> 14:27.173
You don't get to take the high
moral ground right now, Nicky!

14:27.256 --> 14:30.593
I know. I'm sorry, Marka.

14:30.677 --> 14:33.847
[stammers] I have a problem. I admit that.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.932
And I will do a better
job dealing with my shit.

14:36.015 --> 14:37.726
I just, uh...

14:37.809 --> 14:39.602
I don't know.

14:39.686 --> 14:42.646
Maybe it's 'cause it's almost
the anniversary of the divorce.

14:42.731 --> 14:45.108
You know, I'm having a bad week,

14:45.191 --> 14:48.903
and I did this thing and I fucked up.

14:48.987 --> 14:50.238
And if I'm serious about
being a better person...

14:50.321 --> 14:53.657
Come on! It starts with me bailing
my friends out of jail, okay?

14:53.742 --> 14:55.744
- Mom, please.
- Fine. Fine.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.329
You're probably gonna need more
than that. Use my credit card.

14:58.412 --> 15:00.957
- No, no, no, I'm good. All right.
- What are you doing?

15:01.040 --> 15:02.792
I'll give you a ride back
to the police station.

15:02.876 --> 15:04.627
I just need to take a walk,
okay, and think a little.

15:04.711 --> 15:08.422
But, um, thank you, Marka. I'm
so grateful, really. I just, uh...

15:08.506 --> 15:10.383
Let's get a coffee soon
and catch up a little.

15:10.466 --> 15:11.550
I'd like that.

15:19.475 --> 15:20.643
Pardon?

15:20.727 --> 15:27.441
I mean, is it something that animals did
or did it start with cavemen or cavewomen?

15:27.525 --> 15:31.570
I doubt a woman brought it up first.

15:31.654 --> 15:33.656
Great apes did have those teeth.

15:33.740 --> 15:35.784
You know, I bet it was a caveman.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.535
I bet he was like,

15:37.618 --> 15:40.246
[in deep voice] "Hey, Grog,
you think fire's a big deal,

15:40.329 --> 15:41.414
but check this out!"

15:41.497 --> 15:42.498
[grunting]

15:42.581 --> 15:44.625
- [Piper] Oh, whoa, whoa.
- [blows raspberry]

15:44.708 --> 15:47.628
Though, if it was an ape...

15:47.711 --> 15:51.007
that would explain why we
lost our sharp incisors.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.134
- For blowjobs?
- Yeah.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.845
You're saying our mouths
evolved to give blowjobs?

15:55.929 --> 16:00.474
That's assuming you believe in
evolution in the first place.

16:02.351 --> 16:03.853
I'm thinking about it.

16:06.397 --> 16:07.690
- Hey!
- Really?

16:08.607 --> 16:10.819
A hickey? What are you, 12?

16:10.902 --> 16:12.236
It was an accident.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.407
You're trying to brand me... but
I am not your fucking sex cow.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.284
You're mine.

16:19.911 --> 16:20.995
What does that mean?

16:21.079 --> 16:23.456
It means that I am gonna
hurt you the next chance I get

16:23.539 --> 16:25.708
and take my power back.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.710
You're acting insane.

16:27.794 --> 16:29.170
I'm insane?

16:30.254 --> 16:34.467
Kubra knows exactly where I am now.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.760
Do you have any idea the
danger that you've put me in?

16:36.845 --> 16:39.138
[stammering] The... I took... You...

16:40.639 --> 16:42.641
You know what?

16:42.725 --> 16:45.436
Forget it. I can't.

16:45.519 --> 16:48.857
Oh, it's so nice to see
you guys back together.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.234
We're not together.

16:51.317 --> 16:52.610
She's my sex cow.

16:53.736 --> 16:54.863
Oh.

16:54.946 --> 16:58.074
Well, that's, uh... sweet.

16:58.157 --> 17:00.368
You gonna come to drama class later?

17:00.451 --> 17:01.828
Are you serious?

17:01.911 --> 17:04.163
Have you met Berdie? She's amazing.

17:04.247 --> 17:06.582
Yeah, we met. She's my counselor.

17:06.665 --> 17:08.001
Oh, lucky ducky.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.318
I think I'm gonna sit this one out.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.797
Oh, why? You don't have a job
and they burned all the books.

17:13.882 --> 17:14.922
[Sister Ingalls] Not true.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.646
There is one book they were afraid to burn.

17:16.675 --> 17:18.426
Mmm, I stand corrected.

17:18.511 --> 17:21.805
There is a bedbug-infested
Quran if you want to read that.

17:22.390 --> 17:25.309
All right! Suit yourself. Sheesh.

17:25.393 --> 17:27.478
I took acting at high school,

17:27.560 --> 17:32.191
and we learned about masks,
musicals and chlamydia dell'arte,

17:32.275 --> 17:34.318
- and that is from Europe.
- [gasps]

17:42.451 --> 17:44.954
He claims it's not happening,
but they don't tell us anything.

17:45.038 --> 17:47.165
Probably afraid we'll
cash in our vacation days.

17:47.248 --> 17:49.792
We're not even people to them.

17:49.876 --> 17:52.003
- [Caputo] Hey, guys.
- Hey.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.462
[O'Neill] Hey. [Ford] Hey.

17:54.505 --> 17:57.383
So, Bell... how's it going with the house?

17:57.466 --> 18:00.094
Not bad. I took out a
home-improvement loan.

18:00.178 --> 18:02.346
- Good thing I have a steady job.
- Yeah.

18:03.264 --> 18:06.350
[Ford] It'd probably be really hard
trying to sell that thing right now, huh?

18:06.434 --> 18:08.937
In this market? With a cracked foundation?

18:09.020 --> 18:10.021
I'd be screwed.

18:10.104 --> 18:12.106
Uh, thankfully, we all
have jobs we can count on

18:12.190 --> 18:13.607
so we can plan our futures accordingly.

18:13.691 --> 18:15.401
[Ford] Mmm-hmm.

18:21.407 --> 18:23.409
- He's fucking lying.
- He didn't say anything.

18:23.492 --> 18:25.828
He didn't need to. Crap, crap, crap.

18:25.912 --> 18:27.413
Wait, did you really take out a loan?

18:27.496 --> 18:30.917
Yes, I did, baby, for
the rumpus room, remember?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.252
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly.

18:33.336 --> 18:35.588
[trembling]

18:39.217 --> 18:41.302
So, you're really
jumping in headfirst, huh?

18:41.385 --> 18:42.386
How do you mean?

18:42.470 --> 18:45.056
Well, I tried setting
up programs like this.

18:45.139 --> 18:47.266
A little tip...

18:47.350 --> 18:49.602
don't expect too much...

18:49.685 --> 18:52.271
and if you want them to open
up, you'd better bring a crowbar.

18:53.897 --> 18:55.608
What's up, Berdie?

18:55.691 --> 18:59.195
Well, look who dragged
their stanky asses downtown.

18:59.278 --> 19:01.155
Oh, bitch, you ain't shit!

19:01.239 --> 19:02.949
That's right, I'm the shit.

19:03.032 --> 19:06.577
Oh, nice. Nice save. Nice save.

19:06.660 --> 19:09.205
Oh, look, it's Snow White
and the Seven Freaks.

19:09.288 --> 19:11.207
[Maureen] There's six of
us. [Rogers] You can count.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.251
Color me impressed.

19:13.334 --> 19:14.961
Have a seat, Rain Man.

19:15.044 --> 19:16.379
Is she giving you a shot
off your record to be here?

19:16.462 --> 19:17.463
[scoffs]

19:21.009 --> 19:23.219
[Healy] All right, great turnout.

19:23.302 --> 19:24.928
And look who's late.

19:25.013 --> 19:27.681
[in deep voice] It's Alex
Vause, you dumb bitch.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.225
What?

19:37.816 --> 19:40.653
[chuckles] Okay, everybody
up. Let's do a warmup.

19:40.736 --> 19:42.571
We're gonna do a counting warmup.

19:42.655 --> 19:44.907
[all] One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

[Taystee singing] ♪ Dear Lord ♪

19:48.952 --> 19:51.080
We are gathered here today

19:51.164 --> 19:56.002
to remember those that were martyred
in the conflagration of three days ago.

19:56.669 --> 20:00.298
It is a sad day when
any book is not returned,

20:00.381 --> 20:03.301
or when it is returned,
but with pages missing

20:03.384 --> 20:07.305
'cause some fool needed to write a note,
or they needed to wipe their nasty ass,

20:07.388 --> 20:08.431
but anyway...

20:08.514 --> 20:14.520
To have our entire flock
taken from us is almost...

20:15.688 --> 20:17.148
beyond reckoning.

20:17.231 --> 20:21.610
So we take this time to honor
those titles that we've lost.

20:23.529 --> 20:25.864
Go ahead, Washington.

20:25.948 --> 20:27.450
Yeah, um...

20:27.533 --> 20:30.994
So, I've never been at a
funeral for books before.

20:31.079 --> 20:33.164
And, like... [scoffs] I feel like...

20:33.247 --> 20:37.418
there's nothing I can say
that wouldn't be better said...

20:37.501 --> 20:39.002
- in, like, a book.
- Mmm!

20:39.920 --> 20:43.799
- But books are made of paper from trees...
- Yeah.

20:43.882 --> 20:47.178
So we thought they should
be returned to the trees

20:47.261 --> 20:49.680
from whence they came and everything.

20:49.763 --> 20:52.516
- The ultimate book return.
- Yeah.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.812
And now I'm just going to read some
titles we all thought were worth honoring.

20:59.315 --> 21:01.734
- Great Expectations.
- [Taystee] Solid.

21:02.568 --> 21:04.403
- The BFG.
- Tight.

21:04.987 --> 21:08.241
Damn. The dictionary. The dictionary, man!

21:08.324 --> 21:10.368
What are we gonna do in the
world without a damn dictionary?

21:10.451 --> 21:14.497
Sister Souljah. Oh. A High Wind in Jamaica.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.039
All the David Sedaris'.

21:16.124 --> 21:18.209
Or Sedari, I guess?

21:18.292 --> 21:20.169
What's going on?

21:20.253 --> 21:22.588
We're having a memorial service.

21:22.671 --> 21:24.047
For books?

21:24.132 --> 21:26.092
Yeah, for books and all printed media.

21:26.175 --> 21:27.718
I didn't know you were such a big reader.

21:27.801 --> 21:30.888
_

21:30.971 --> 21:34.350
The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre by B. Traven.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.477
Have you, um, seen Bennett?

21:37.576 --> 21:40.148
No, I haven't seen him
since before the weekend.

21:40.231 --> 21:42.691
Oh. Maybe his shifts got moved around.

21:42.775 --> 21:45.903
Uh, excuse me. Can you show some respect?

21:45.986 --> 21:48.447
Sorry. My condolences.

21:50.210 --> 21:51.419
Go ahead.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.405
- The Tale of Squirrel Nutkins.
- Mmm!

21:54.703 --> 21:56.205
- The Jonathans.
- Mmm!

21:56.289 --> 21:59.542
Damn. Swift, Lethem, Tropper,

21:59.625 --> 22:03.296
Franzen, Kellerman, Livingston Seagull.

22:03.379 --> 22:04.463
God bless.

22:04.547 --> 22:06.006
[shoes thudding]

22:07.716 --> 22:10.553
So, you really believe
all this mumbo gumbo?

22:10.636 --> 22:13.347
I don't know. There's
something calm about her.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.891
She has, like, a quiet energy.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.976
She's a mute.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.603
Yeah, that helps with that.

22:19.687 --> 22:21.939
- [Leanne chuckles]
- [Angie] And she's white.

22:22.022 --> 22:24.858
So, I trust her magic
more than the Spanish kind.

22:24.942 --> 22:26.652
You'll believe anything.

22:26.735 --> 22:28.111
You play the lottery.

22:28.196 --> 22:29.238
That's different.

22:29.322 --> 22:31.657
At least with the lottery,
you know each time you play,

22:31.740 --> 22:33.701
your chances are a
little better every time.

22:33.784 --> 22:35.661
I don't think it works like that.

22:35.744 --> 22:38.914
Like you know. What'd you wish for?

22:38.997 --> 22:41.375
- I'm not telling.
- Why not?

22:41.459 --> 22:45.921
Because it's birthday
wish rules. You can't say.

22:46.004 --> 22:48.882
[Kowalski] Hey, what the
hell is going on in here?

22:48.966 --> 22:51.051
- [Leanne shouting] What?
- [thudding continues]

22:51.134 --> 22:54.054
Oh, we're drying shoes. They
said to dry all the shoes.

22:54.137 --> 22:57.015
In the dryers? Let me see the work order.

22:58.267 --> 22:59.560
Fine.

23:03.814 --> 23:05.858
[Leanne] Hey, are we gonna get
more detergent soon, or what?

23:05.941 --> 23:09.362
We're almost all out. I told
Caputo we need to order more.

23:09.445 --> 23:12.197
I'm not sure he really cares at this point.

23:13.366 --> 23:16.034
You really should have ear protection.

23:16.118 --> 23:17.495
Do you have any?

23:17.578 --> 23:18.704
No.

23:18.787 --> 23:21.332
I just mean, in a perfect world.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.750
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]
[mouthing]

23:26.880 --> 23:29.092
[Angie] Leanne. Leanne!

23:29.117 --> 23:30.368
What?

23:34.928 --> 23:36.179
What is this?

23:36.264 --> 23:39.392
My wish! My wish came true!

23:40.393 --> 23:42.978
- [Angie squealing]
- [Leanne shushing]

23:43.061 --> 23:44.563
Calm down.

23:44.647 --> 23:45.689
[Angie] It's magic.

23:45.773 --> 23:46.940
[Lorna] Frankie?

23:47.024 --> 23:48.025
Oh! Oh.

23:48.108 --> 23:49.109
Frankie.

23:49.192 --> 23:50.903
[mouthing]

23:50.986 --> 23:52.863
You have a phone call, Frankie.

23:52.946 --> 23:55.157
Would you like to take the phone?

23:56.617 --> 23:57.868
Take the phone.

23:57.951 --> 23:59.287
It's not a phone.

23:59.370 --> 24:00.538
What is it?

24:00.621 --> 24:02.373
- It's a dog.
- [stifles laughter]

24:02.456 --> 24:03.457
[Lorna] No, it's not.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.501
Agree to the situation. Roll with it.

24:05.584 --> 24:07.169
But she is clear...

24:07.252 --> 24:08.253
[exhales deeply]

24:09.254 --> 24:11.840
All right, it's a dog. Uh, my mistake.

24:11.924 --> 24:14.968
And here is the phone.

24:15.052 --> 24:16.387
That's not a phone, either.

24:17.179 --> 24:18.221
What is it?

24:18.306 --> 24:19.640
A dick!

24:19.723 --> 24:21.266
[all laughing]

24:21.350 --> 24:22.893
I can't... I can't work
like this. I will not.

24:22.976 --> 24:24.144
All right, settle down.

24:24.227 --> 24:26.522
Yo, agree to the
situation. That's the rules.

24:26.605 --> 24:28.231
I can't agree to that. It's nonsense!

24:28.316 --> 24:30.067
[Brook] This is not how
you're supposed to do improv.

24:30.150 --> 24:31.860
I took a class at UCB.

24:31.944 --> 24:35.656
Oh, good for you, Queen Improv.
This is not your kingdom.

24:35.739 --> 24:37.115
All right, let's get someone else up here.

24:37.199 --> 24:38.659
- [groaning]
- [Taystee] Ooh!

24:38.742 --> 24:40.035
Warren, you already went.

24:40.118 --> 24:42.162
Oh, but you said I needed to sublimate

24:42.245 --> 24:45.123
my sense of abandonment
issues in activities.

24:45.207 --> 24:47.209
I don't remember saying that.

24:47.292 --> 24:50.212
How about Chapman and, um, Vause?

24:51.547 --> 24:53.632
No, thanks. I'm good.

24:53.716 --> 24:56.719
Well, we're all good. What's the
matter? These two got history?

24:57.761 --> 24:59.472
You know, with all due respect,

24:59.555 --> 25:05.310
I don't think that you're gonna get the
greatest performances out of us today.

25:05.394 --> 25:08.356
I don't want a performance. I
want to see you listen and react.

25:08.439 --> 25:10.190
Show me some emotional honesty.

25:10.273 --> 25:12.443
I want to learn how to cry on cue and shit.

25:12.526 --> 25:16.071
Like, get real good, win me an Oscar.

25:16.154 --> 25:18.574
Never have to buy my own clothes again.

25:18.657 --> 25:19.700
[both vocalizing]

25:19.783 --> 25:22.828
Let's work on empathy, and then
we'll worry about free clothes.

25:22.911 --> 25:24.538
Vause, come on up.

25:24.622 --> 25:26.289
Chapman, let's go. Come on.

25:27.541 --> 25:30.544
All right. I need a location.

25:30.628 --> 25:31.879
The moon.

25:33.088 --> 25:34.590
Uh, grocery store?

25:34.673 --> 25:35.883
A grocery store.

25:35.966 --> 25:37.843
You're the manager at a grocery store,

25:37.926 --> 25:41.263
and you are a customer, who's returning...

25:41.346 --> 25:42.806
A live grenade.

25:42.890 --> 25:43.974
The moon.

25:44.057 --> 25:46.177
- [Maureen] A bruised pear.
- [Rogers] A bruised pear.

25:46.184 --> 25:48.562
No, cantaloupe.

25:49.397 --> 25:51.106
- Cantaloupe.
- [Maureen] Uh, no, pear.

25:51.189 --> 25:52.483
Pear.

25:52.566 --> 25:54.067
[Rogers] You sure?

25:54.151 --> 25:57.195
Pear. Uh, no, peach.

25:58.947 --> 26:00.991
A bruised piece of fruit. Sound good?

26:01.074 --> 26:04.870
No. You're never supposed to
start an improv with a transaction.

26:06.497 --> 26:07.915
But whatever.

26:07.998 --> 26:10.543
All right, try to keep
it up for three minutes.

26:10.626 --> 26:11.627
Begin.

26:14.046 --> 26:15.338
[inhales deeply]

26:16.256 --> 26:20.969
This fruit is defective.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.806
How so?

26:25.265 --> 26:27.435
It's all nasty and bruised up.

26:29.853 --> 26:33.441
Well, it's organic fruit.

26:33.524 --> 26:37.194
So if you don't like my produce,

26:37.277 --> 26:40.280
you can take your business elsewhere.

26:40.363 --> 26:42.783
[both] Ooh. [Alex] Oh, I can't, actually.

26:42.866 --> 26:43.867
[Piper] And why not?

26:43.951 --> 26:45.744
Because then the scene would be over.

26:45.828 --> 26:47.830
And she said we had to keep
it going for three minutes.

26:47.913 --> 26:49.915
Well, I don't know what to tell
you. It's fruit, so get over it.

26:49.998 --> 26:51.041
I am over it.

26:51.124 --> 26:53.210
You're obviously not.
You're not over anything.

26:53.293 --> 26:54.587
[Alex sighs]

26:54.670 --> 26:55.963
But you know what?

26:57.047 --> 26:59.049
You get what you pay for.

26:59.132 --> 27:01.132
When are you gonna realize
that you don't get to do

27:01.134 --> 27:03.428
whatever you want because
it makes you feel good?

27:03.512 --> 27:05.973
Oh, my God. You are such a hypocrite.

27:06.056 --> 27:07.808
No! You crossed a line!

27:07.891 --> 27:09.309
[Piper] I did? [Alex] Yes!

27:09.392 --> 27:12.270
[Piper] Do you think
that this is what I want?

27:12.354 --> 27:14.397
To be here in this, um...

27:15.816 --> 27:18.110
In this grocery store?

27:18.193 --> 27:19.194
Mmm.

27:20.153 --> 27:21.393
I'm sorry I sold you the fruit.

27:21.446 --> 27:25.993
And, yes, fine. I will admit
it. I knew it was bad. I did.

27:26.076 --> 27:28.496
But I wanted my power back, too.

27:30.163 --> 27:32.124
Because I wanted you back.

27:34.292 --> 27:35.503
Because...

27:36.837 --> 27:38.255
I missed you...

27:40.924 --> 27:44.427
and I missed your...

27:47.848 --> 27:49.432
patronage.

27:50.518 --> 27:53.729
So, I sold you bad fruit

27:53.812 --> 27:56.607
so you would come back into my store.

27:56.690 --> 27:58.275
And I know it was wrong,

27:59.902 --> 28:01.403
and I'm sorry.

28:01.486 --> 28:03.864
But I'm also not sorry,

28:03.947 --> 28:06.449
because it is...

28:07.785 --> 28:10.663
so... good...

28:11.830 --> 28:13.541
to see you...

28:18.546 --> 28:19.713
customer.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.306
Would you, maybe, like
another piece of fruit?

28:29.389 --> 28:30.724
This is...

28:35.563 --> 28:36.605
It's a persimmon.

28:36.689 --> 28:38.398
Mmm-mmm. That's a dick.

28:38.481 --> 28:39.942
[all laughing]

28:42.986 --> 28:44.822
You know I have a thing for soft fruit.

28:44.905 --> 28:47.741
[Black Cindy]
Bow-chicka-bow-bow!

28:47.825 --> 28:49.535
[all cheering]

28:52.746 --> 28:56.374
All right. Good work, good work.

29:01.046 --> 29:03.423
[inmates chattering]

29:03.506 --> 29:05.467
You really want out of here, huh?

29:05.551 --> 29:08.511
[stammering] Do you not want out?

29:08.596 --> 29:09.638
Eh.

29:09.722 --> 29:10.973
I don't really care, you know?

29:11.056 --> 29:14.727
So, it's like, if it does happen,
then it'll be a nice surprise.

29:14.810 --> 29:15.853
But then, if it doesn't,

29:15.936 --> 29:18.606
then it's like I didn't care to begin with.

29:18.689 --> 29:23.318
It's kind of like a...
double-reverse jinx blocker.

29:23.401 --> 29:25.738
- [Pennsatucky laughs]
- It's a good strategy.

29:25.821 --> 29:27.197
- I thought so.
- No, it's good.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.116
- Hey. Hey, Boo.
- [Big Boo] Hey, Doggett.

29:29.199 --> 29:31.619
- How are you?
- You mind making like The Exorcist?

29:31.702 --> 29:35.748
What? I can't. I don't lay hands anymore.

29:36.749 --> 29:39.334
- Get the hell out of here.
- Oh.

29:40.669 --> 29:43.421
- I get it. I get it, you're cute.
- Yeah?

29:43.505 --> 29:45.799
All right, how about
this one? [clears throat]

29:45.883 --> 29:49.427
How about I make like the
two feet and get to walking?

29:49.511 --> 29:50.971
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

29:52.598 --> 29:55.017
Yeah, that's gold. Solid gold.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.019
[Pennsatucky] All right. I'll go.

29:58.771 --> 30:00.814
Boo, before you start in, I
don't know where it is, all right?

30:00.898 --> 30:03.734
There's too many junkies.
It, like, could be anyone.

30:03.817 --> 30:06.153
Yeah, you're right. It could be anyone.

30:06.236 --> 30:09.406
Only, I'm thinking it's
one in particular, hmm?

30:09.489 --> 30:12.117
One who was reluctant to give
the shit up in the first place.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.995
Oh, yeah, yeah, you mean
me? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:15.078 --> 30:18.916
Oh, yeah. I took it
all, yeah. You caught me.

30:18.999 --> 30:22.335
Good, 'cause I'd rather not make
thousands of dollars, you know? I don't.

30:22.419 --> 30:25.422
Uh, committing suicide with dope
after being clean for two years

30:25.505 --> 30:28.383
is the much better plan.
I'm a genius. [scoffs]

30:30.260 --> 30:31.679
[mouthing]

30:31.762 --> 30:33.889
You best not be lying to me, bitch.

30:33.972 --> 30:36.349
Give me a fucking break, huh?

30:36.433 --> 30:38.936
Marka wouldn't give me the money.

30:39.019 --> 30:42.064
All right, what am I supposed to do?
You want me to break you out of jail?

30:42.147 --> 30:44.775
[scoffs] All right, come on, man.

30:44.858 --> 30:48.153
Look, Drew, I mean, seriously,
you can't dump all this shit on me.

30:48.236 --> 30:49.822
Is that Drew? Say hi for me.

30:49.905 --> 30:51.031
Shh.

30:51.114 --> 30:52.991
- Drew?
- [whispering] Say hi for me.

30:53.075 --> 30:54.910
[scoffs] Fucking people, man.

30:54.993 --> 30:58.121
You know, I didn't force
them to get in the cab,

30:58.205 --> 31:00.708
and now they're acting like it's my fault,

31:00.791 --> 31:03.871
like I should feel so bad they're gonna
have to spend a couple nights in jail.

31:03.877 --> 31:06.714
Some people like to blame
everyone else for their problems.

31:06.797 --> 31:10.217
Like my brother. Pins
everything on our dad.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.719
I'm like, "Get off it."

31:12.803 --> 31:14.262
He molested me, too.

31:15.889 --> 31:17.975
I turned out fine.

31:18.058 --> 31:19.184
Tell you what,

31:19.267 --> 31:21.770
those two could use a couple
of nights in jail, you know?

31:21.854 --> 31:25.107
Fucking whiny bitches, acting
like the world owes them.

31:27.484 --> 31:28.485
That all we have left?

31:28.568 --> 31:29.820
Yeah, that's it.

31:30.988 --> 31:32.364
That sucks.

31:34.449 --> 31:35.826
Hey, you know who else is a little cunt?

31:35.909 --> 31:41.081
That girl, uh, Monica, you
know, that party on West End?

31:41.164 --> 31:42.833
Huh?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.584
That apartment with all the rare books?

31:44.667 --> 31:46.378
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:46.461 --> 31:49.882
Yeah, she showed me a signed first
edition of The Old Man and the Sea

31:49.965 --> 31:51.424
that she said is worth a shit-ton.

31:51.508 --> 31:54.094
I bet that girl can't even fucking read.

31:58.265 --> 32:00.600
Shit, do you know how to
get into that building?

32:00.683 --> 32:03.203
Yep, they leave the door open
during the day for the dog walker.

32:03.270 --> 32:05.355
Maybe, if we make enough
off of these books,

32:05.438 --> 32:07.274
we can help out Drew and Jade.

32:07.357 --> 32:08.776
Oh, yeah. That'd be nice.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.320
You know, let's play it by ear.

32:15.532 --> 32:17.325
[groans] For crying out
loud, Norma, come on,

32:17.409 --> 32:18.660
can't you just keep
this shit in the kitchen?

32:18.744 --> 32:21.789
We don't like the kitchen. We like Norma.

32:21.872 --> 32:23.874
Get off my floor!

32:25.042 --> 32:27.252
Look, Norma doesn't even
know what she's doing.

32:27.878 --> 32:29.171
No offense.

32:29.254 --> 32:33.716
That's not true. She has powers.

32:33.801 --> 32:36.053
Powerful powers.

32:36.136 --> 32:39.556
[Angie] I prayed to Norma for deliverance,

32:39.639 --> 32:43.393
and deliverance felleth from the sky.

32:43.476 --> 32:45.603
- [scoffs]
- I'm telling you,

32:45.687 --> 32:50.483
what Elvis did for music
and Eminem did for rap,

32:50.567 --> 32:55.823
- Norma is gonna do for jungle magic.
- [Leanne chuckles]

32:58.033 --> 32:59.034
Fuck!

33:00.493 --> 33:01.494
[sighs]

33:03.121 --> 33:04.122
Fuck!

33:08.293 --> 33:11.129
Luschek. Remember when I...

33:11.213 --> 33:12.493
What the fuck? All right, listen.

33:12.505 --> 33:14.185
Remember when I said the heroin was stolen?

33:14.257 --> 33:16.343
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, I'm the one who stole it.

33:16.426 --> 33:17.427
All right, but now...

33:17.510 --> 33:19.096
Now the meth-heads have it,
and we need to get it back.

33:19.179 --> 33:21.639
[sighs] All right, look,
man, I'm sorry, all right?

33:21.723 --> 33:23.308
I couldn't say goodbye, I'm an addict.

33:23.391 --> 33:24.852
How convenient.

33:24.935 --> 33:28.021
Well, it's not, actually,
for me or anyone around me.

33:28.105 --> 33:30.585
Didn't that shit, like, kill
you? Like, didn't your heart stop?

33:30.607 --> 33:33.735
Man, it's not a rational thing, you know?

33:33.819 --> 33:36.404
But I want it out of here, I really do.

33:36.488 --> 33:38.365
I can't trust you.

33:38.448 --> 33:40.325
You're gonna fuck it up for both of us.

33:40.408 --> 33:42.702
I'm not gonna fuck this up, okay?

33:42.785 --> 33:44.913
I've made up my mind.

33:44.997 --> 33:46.331
I don't want to die again, all right?

33:46.414 --> 33:49.877
[stammering] There is
no white light for me.

33:51.128 --> 33:55.007
If we don't get this stuff out of here,
it's gonna find its way back to me,

33:55.090 --> 33:57.009
or me to it, you know?

33:57.092 --> 34:00.803
I'm like a bloodhound for oblivion.

34:01.596 --> 34:03.556
Well, oblivion doesn't make
a great business partner.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.934
It'll be different this time, all right?

34:06.018 --> 34:09.021
I swear. Just, you got to trust me.

34:17.195 --> 34:19.489
- [line ringing]
- [breathing shakily]

34:21.699 --> 34:22.951
[cell phone ringing]

34:24.202 --> 34:25.245
Hello?

34:25.328 --> 34:27.746
Hey, could you take those two club
chairs, put them right in there?

34:27.830 --> 34:30.708
And then when the sofa comes, I want
it against the wall here. Thanks.

34:30.792 --> 34:31.918
Hello?

34:32.002 --> 34:34.754
Hey, Natalie, it's Joe.

34:34.837 --> 34:36.005
How's Albany?

34:36.089 --> 34:37.132
[scoffs]

34:37.215 --> 34:39.384
It's a burgeoning tech
valley. What do you want?

34:39.467 --> 34:41.678
Congratulations to you on your win.

34:41.761 --> 34:45.764
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.
It's been crazy around here.

34:45.848 --> 34:48.101
Yeah, I hear they're
shutting down the camp.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.187
How do you know that?

34:50.270 --> 34:54.732
Oh, Jason hears everything.
Joe, I am so sorry.

34:54.815 --> 34:58.736
It's dark times. Dark, dark times. For you.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.364
Yes, my times are dark.

35:02.407 --> 35:06.328
[sighs] Actually, I was calling because
I thought maybe you can talk to Jason.

35:06.411 --> 35:09.331
Talk to Jason about what, Beer Can?

35:10.665 --> 35:12.960
About not closing the camp.

35:13.043 --> 35:16.046
Maybe there's an emergency
fund or something?

35:16.129 --> 35:20.842
Oh, yeah, that's not really in his
purview, more of a federal issue.

35:20.926 --> 35:24.012
Look, Natalie, I know you hate me.

35:24.096 --> 35:25.931
And, obviously, I, um...

35:28.225 --> 35:30.185
Think about everybody else.

35:30.268 --> 35:33.146
- Think about Bell, Maxwell, Ford...
- I am so sorry.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.398
You know, I am really bad with names.

35:35.482 --> 35:36.816
- [knocking on door]
- Nat?

35:36.899 --> 35:38.659
Can I get your advice
about the floor runner?

35:38.735 --> 35:40.988
It's looking a little
country with a "K" to me.

35:41.071 --> 35:42.197
One second.

35:43.323 --> 35:44.992
You know what, Joe? I really got to run.

35:45.075 --> 35:47.910
But it was so nice catching up.

35:47.995 --> 35:51.414
Maybe I should talk to Gavin instead.

35:51.498 --> 35:52.958
Is that a name you remember?

35:53.708 --> 35:56.503
Gavin? Your husband's butt boy?

35:57.129 --> 36:00.465
What are you doing? Are
you trying to threaten me?

36:00.548 --> 36:01.924
No, of course not.

36:02.009 --> 36:05.762
I'm just suggesting that
if the prison was to close,

36:05.845 --> 36:09.599
basically because you fleeced
us before running off to Albany,

36:09.682 --> 36:14.146
I might be inclined to inform
the voters of your district

36:14.229 --> 36:19.026
that your husband is a lying,
embezzling fudge packer.

36:19.109 --> 36:20.568
That's offensive.

36:20.652 --> 36:24.072
I know. Homophobia is a bitch.

36:24.156 --> 36:26.033
I could see why you'd
want to keep it a secret.

36:26.116 --> 36:29.452
Joe, what's done is done.

36:29.536 --> 36:32.664
There's no magic wand. Really.

36:32.747 --> 36:33.873
I believe you.

36:33.956 --> 36:35.750
So, what is the point?

36:35.833 --> 36:36.918
I don't know.

36:37.002 --> 36:38.920
A sense of justice, maybe?

36:39.004 --> 36:40.630
Dark times.

36:40.713 --> 36:42.632
I'll take my pleasures where they come.

36:42.715 --> 36:46.844
Joe, you have to take a
macro view on these things.

36:46.928 --> 36:49.931
I'm in a position now to make
changes for the greater...

36:50.015 --> 36:51.766
Burn in hell, Natalie.

36:52.517 --> 36:53.560
[receiver slams]

36:53.643 --> 36:55.145
[Healy] Katya...

36:56.354 --> 36:59.941
all I want is for you to be happy.

37:00.025 --> 37:04.196
[speaking Russian] All he
wants is for you to be happy.

37:06.198 --> 37:07.324
[speaking English] I don't know why,

37:07.407 --> 37:10.577
but we've lost the feeling
we had in the beginning.

37:12.162 --> 37:17.042
[speaking Russian] You've lost that
feeling you had at the beginning.

37:18.168 --> 37:20.378
[speaking English] We never
have real feeling at beginning,

37:20.462 --> 37:22.714
because you're not the man
you say to me on Internet.

37:22.797 --> 37:24.591
You catfish.

37:25.550 --> 37:26.801
Catfish?

37:28.470 --> 37:30.555
[speaking Russian] I thought
he was a real psychologist.

37:30.638 --> 37:33.141
I thought we'd go to the museum, the opera.

37:33.225 --> 37:34.934
I thought he'd be funny.

37:35.017 --> 37:40.357
He seemed funny online
when he could edit himself.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.441
Mmm.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.486
Um...

37:44.569 --> 37:46.529
[speaking English] You're
not a real psychologist.

37:47.029 --> 37:50.783
You don't go to the opera,
and you're not funny.

37:50.867 --> 37:53.245
[speaking Russian] He yells at me.

37:54.412 --> 37:55.705
[speaking English] And you yell.

37:57.039 --> 37:58.583
[speaking Russian] And drool.

37:58.666 --> 38:03.671
Every morning the sheets are soaked
like a small child has peed the bed,

38:03.755 --> 38:05.798
but from his face.

38:09.010 --> 38:10.095
[sighing]

38:10.178 --> 38:12.514
[speaking English] It...
It doesn't translate.

38:15.933 --> 38:19.061
Look, I have not been perfect,

38:20.147 --> 38:23.191
but there's nothing wrong between us
that we can't work through together.

38:23.275 --> 38:26.778
No, it is too late. I deserve
better man than you, Sam.

38:26.861 --> 38:30.865
Oh, give me a fucking
break. Deserve? Deserve?

38:30.948 --> 38:33.034
You're a mail-order bride.

38:33.118 --> 38:34.744
I'm not a mail-order bride.

38:34.827 --> 38:36.246
[speaking Russian] Whatever.

38:36.329 --> 38:39.791
You "made an arrangement" and
he's holding up his end of it.

38:39.874 --> 38:43.545
And you're the type who
wants the world to be perfect

38:43.628 --> 38:47.340
but you're not willing to
lift a finger to help it along.

38:47.424 --> 38:50.218
He's not the man you
thought he'd be because

38:50.302 --> 38:52.720
the man you thought he'd be doesn't exist.

38:52.804 --> 38:55.557
This is what a good man looks like.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.725
So what if he drools a small pond?

38:57.809 --> 38:59.129
He takes care of you, doesn't he?

38:59.186 --> 39:01.813
He takes care of your mother,
and he's handsome, and he's good.

39:01.896 --> 39:03.565
And at least he's fucking trying,

39:03.648 --> 39:05.858
which is a lot more than I can say for you.

39:17.412 --> 39:19.706
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

39:21.458 --> 39:22.625
Hello?

39:24.001 --> 39:25.253
[inmate sighing]

39:26.338 --> 39:28.506
[Luschek] Hey. Get up.

39:28.590 --> 39:29.799
[Angie] Hey, what?

39:32.177 --> 39:33.345
Get up.

39:35.638 --> 39:36.931
[grunting]

39:40.810 --> 39:42.479
You're high.

39:42.562 --> 39:46.023
[exhales] No. What? No.

39:46.107 --> 39:49.819
I just... I haven't been
sleeping well recently.

39:50.570 --> 39:52.947
Look, I'm gonna give you one chance.

39:53.030 --> 39:56.909
Either you tell me where the drugs are,

39:56.993 --> 39:59.537
or you rot in Max for
the rest of your sentence.

39:59.621 --> 40:01.623
That's not much of a choice.

40:01.706 --> 40:04.083
What's not much of a choice?

40:04.166 --> 40:05.918
Oh, shit.

40:06.002 --> 40:07.545
[Luschek clears throat]

40:07.629 --> 40:08.671
Come on.

40:08.755 --> 40:10.715
God damn it. Upsie whupsie.

40:10.798 --> 40:11.924
[groans]

40:14.386 --> 40:15.428
[plastic crinkles]

40:15.512 --> 40:16.763
Hey.

40:22.435 --> 40:23.436
This it?

40:24.729 --> 40:25.730
Yeah.

40:29.359 --> 40:32.612
- Hey.
- Don't... Those are my tits.

40:32.695 --> 40:34.030
Liar.

40:34.113 --> 40:37.199
These aren't tits! I'm
bringing these to Caputo.

40:38.576 --> 40:41.913
Then why are you putting
her tits in your pants?

40:41.996 --> 40:43.623
He's taking them for himself.

40:45.292 --> 40:47.585
Shut the fuck up!

40:47.669 --> 40:51.881
You tell anybody about this,
and I will fucking kill you!

40:51.964 --> 40:53.174
With murder!

40:54.384 --> 40:55.593
You understand?

41:03.435 --> 41:04.519
Ooh.

41:04.602 --> 41:07.647
Jesus Christ. This is
enough to kill a sperm whale.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.400
Eh, well, ready your harpoons, huh?

41:11.484 --> 41:12.694
[Nicky chuckles]

41:13.403 --> 41:14.862
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

41:14.946 --> 41:16.072
Ooh.

41:18.074 --> 41:19.617
Hey, man, what's your problem?

41:19.701 --> 41:22.244
It's not for you. You're done, remember?

41:22.329 --> 41:24.914
Look, I'm just saying goodbye.

41:25.873 --> 41:26.874
Again?

41:26.958 --> 41:29.294
How many goodbyes do you need?

41:29.377 --> 41:32.004
Jesus Christ. You're
like Gollum with the ring.

41:32.088 --> 41:36.175
You're a better person... off heroin.

41:36.258 --> 41:38.135
You never saw me on heroin.

41:38.219 --> 41:39.471
I get the picture.

41:39.554 --> 41:40.763
[Nicky chuckling]

41:41.889 --> 41:43.015
You tell Boo about this?

41:43.099 --> 41:46.811
I mean, I probably should, but,
like, eh, fuck it, it's Boo, you know?

41:47.604 --> 41:48.771
Don't tell her.

41:48.855 --> 41:51.023
One less fuck-up to expose the conspiracy.

41:52.609 --> 41:54.611
Actually, this is a good
thing that we're doing,

41:54.694 --> 41:55.737
getting this shit out of here.

41:55.820 --> 41:58.323
I don't like the idea of you or any
of the other poochies around here

41:58.406 --> 41:59.616
getting hooked on this poison.

41:59.699 --> 42:02.660
What, but some random
schmucks in Utica is fine?

42:02.744 --> 42:04.286
We don't know 'em.

42:05.372 --> 42:06.664
Come on.

42:07.749 --> 42:09.834
Some sick thinking you got there.

42:15.673 --> 42:18.593
Hey, Guerrera. That guard's back.

42:19.386 --> 42:20.803
Mmm. The cute one?

42:20.887 --> 42:22.514
Yeah. Right outside.

42:22.597 --> 42:24.682
[Lea] Mmm. [Annie] He smells good, too.

42:24.766 --> 42:25.767
[Lea] Mmm-hmm.

42:30.938 --> 42:32.524
[inmates chattering]

42:35.443 --> 42:36.694
Can I help you?

42:39.321 --> 42:40.532
No.

42:46.704 --> 42:47.705
[Leanne] Hey.

42:47.789 --> 42:48.915
[Ford] What?

42:48.998 --> 42:51.292
We know where you can find drugs.

42:51.376 --> 42:52.794
You ratting someone out?

42:52.877 --> 42:56.255
Yeah, but not one of us. One of youse.

42:56.338 --> 42:58.007
Move along, inmate.

42:58.090 --> 43:00.342
- Yeah, but...
- You heard me.

43:01.803 --> 43:04.346
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

43:04.431 --> 43:06.271
- Don't you at least want a hint?
- Move along!

43:06.348 --> 43:08.142
Okay. Okay.

43:11.521 --> 43:14.231
Electrical. Look in electrical.

43:14.315 --> 43:15.817
And in Luschek.

43:19.821 --> 43:21.781
[both moaning]

43:21.864 --> 43:23.783
- Mmm. Pull my hair.
- What?

43:23.866 --> 43:25.326
Just pull my hair.

43:25.410 --> 43:26.453
- [grunts]
- Ouch!

43:27.995 --> 43:29.330
Sorry.

43:29.414 --> 43:32.208
Don't... Don't apologize, Alex.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.419
Just fucking, like... [grunts]

43:34.502 --> 43:35.962
- Oh, God!
- You know, like...

43:37.254 --> 43:38.965
No, it's just... It feels weird now.

43:39.048 --> 43:40.675
What are you... It's not the same.

43:40.758 --> 43:43.094
It's not the same. It
just... It feels weird.

43:43.177 --> 43:44.971
I don't, like...

43:48.349 --> 43:50.392
I don't wanna hurt you.

43:53.855 --> 43:55.064
[sighs]

43:56.524 --> 43:58.526
Fucking empathy!

43:58.610 --> 44:00.152
I knew that class was a bad idea.

44:01.488 --> 44:04.365
What are we gonna do now
if we can't have hate sex?

44:05.908 --> 44:07.535
Hate snuggle?

44:07.619 --> 44:11.122
- [scoffs]
- I don't really think that that's a thing.

44:12.665 --> 44:15.960
Nobody's even heard from
him. I bet he got another job.

44:16.043 --> 44:18.004
Good-looking guy like
that has tons of options.

44:18.087 --> 44:19.797
- He has one leg.
- [O'Neill] Yeah, but...

44:19.881 --> 44:21.549
a pretty face is worth 1,000 legs.

44:21.633 --> 44:22.967
Hey.

44:23.050 --> 44:25.970
Did an inmate tell you
something about drugs?

44:27.054 --> 44:28.055
Something like what?

44:28.139 --> 44:29.724
That there's drugs in electrical.

44:29.807 --> 44:33.310
You want us to shake down a guard
now? Don't we have it bad enough?

44:34.270 --> 44:35.522
You knew about this, too?

44:35.605 --> 44:38.065
Those two dum-dums were
squawking all over camp.

44:38.149 --> 44:41.443
Then why didn't any of you
do your job and report it?

44:41.528 --> 44:45.364
You have a responsibility to protect
the safety and welfare of these inmates.

44:45.447 --> 44:49.368
What about your responsibility? To us?

44:49.451 --> 44:52.011
I have a daughter at home. You
won't even tell me what's going on

44:52.038 --> 44:54.666
so I can know if I should
look for another job.

44:54.749 --> 44:56.543
Put your sandwich down.

44:56.626 --> 44:57.627
Why?

44:57.710 --> 45:01.088
Because I said so, and
you will do as you're told,

45:01.172 --> 45:04.050
or you will clean out your locker today.

45:04.884 --> 45:07.303
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

45:08.137 --> 45:09.513
I am sorry.

45:11.641 --> 45:13.184
The prison is closing.

45:14.185 --> 45:18.981
But I need all of you to continue to
do your jobs effectively until it does.

45:20.149 --> 45:21.192
Do you understand me?

45:22.318 --> 45:23.945
[shouting] Do you understand me?

45:27.907 --> 45:30.827
Now, you are gonna come
with Donaldson and me,

45:30.910 --> 45:33.079
and we're gonna perform
a search. Is that clear?

45:34.747 --> 45:35.790
Yes, sir.

45:35.873 --> 45:38.167
[Caputo] Good. Let's go.

45:38.250 --> 45:40.002
You can take your sandwich.

45:41.003 --> 45:42.755
You want us to come?

45:43.840 --> 45:45.174
No.

45:46.718 --> 45:47.844
Good.

45:50.012 --> 45:52.640
Hey, Luschek.

45:52.724 --> 45:56.227
Aren't you worried about
leaving computers with inmates?

45:56.310 --> 45:59.480
Well, maybe if any of you were
technically savvy, or Asian,

45:59.563 --> 46:00.732
but, uh, we screen for that.

46:02.149 --> 46:03.735
Hey, uh, Nichols, come here.

46:03.818 --> 46:06.570
I want to show you a trick
with this switch-y thing.

46:07.697 --> 46:09.616
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

46:10.867 --> 46:11.909
Uh...

46:11.993 --> 46:14.036
It's done.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.960
Mark said it's the best
stuff he's ever tasted.

46:15.997 --> 46:17.498
So, you're a happy man?

46:17.581 --> 46:19.959
[scoffs] Happy? Fuck happy. I'm rich.

46:20.042 --> 46:21.585
Don't spend it all in one place, all right?

46:21.669 --> 46:22.795
I won't.

46:24.046 --> 46:25.840
I'm hitting this casino in Oneida.

46:25.923 --> 46:27.925
Come in to invest.

46:28.009 --> 46:29.426
You sure that's a good idea?

46:29.510 --> 46:31.428
Scared money don't make no money.

46:31.512 --> 46:33.097
[Nicky chuckles] Oh.

46:33.180 --> 46:35.642
Don't forget to put my
share in my commissary, okay?

46:35.725 --> 46:36.768
You got it, partner.

46:38.185 --> 46:39.646
[door opens]

46:39.729 --> 46:42.857
Inmates, on your feet. Stand in a line.

46:42.940 --> 46:44.108
What's going on?

46:44.734 --> 46:47.153
- Drug sweep. You high?
- Huh.

46:47.236 --> 46:49.697
Please. High on life, maybe.

46:49.781 --> 46:52.825
Smoked a big old bowl of
life before I came in today.

46:53.743 --> 46:55.828
Funny. Search his desk.

46:55.912 --> 46:58.748
I was just joking, but,
uh... Fine, go ahead.

47:13.846 --> 47:14.889
Ah.

47:14.972 --> 47:17.349
Found something. Looks like coke.

47:17.433 --> 47:18.893
[Donaldson] No.

47:18.976 --> 47:22.521
It's heroin plus gum.

47:22.604 --> 47:24.315
[Caputo] Wow.

47:24.398 --> 47:27.902
Heroin. I always knew you were a fuck-up,
but I never pegged you for a junkie.

47:27.985 --> 47:29.779
[scoffs] Why do you assume it's me?

47:30.529 --> 47:32.031
[Caputo] It's under your desk.

47:32.114 --> 47:33.866
[Luschek] Everyone has access to my desk.

47:33.950 --> 47:35.367
It doesn't mean shit.

47:35.451 --> 47:37.244
It's her! She's a fucking junkie.

47:37.328 --> 47:39.831
Who, me? [scoffs] It could be anyone.

47:40.790 --> 47:42.333
You're the scumbag.

47:42.416 --> 47:43.960
Scumbag. Seriously?

47:44.043 --> 47:45.669
You're gonna talk to me like that?

47:45.753 --> 47:47.421
I don't even do drugs, man!

47:47.504 --> 47:51.133
I used to smoke marijuana.
But it made me paranoid!

47:51.217 --> 47:54.386
And so did meth. But heroin? Fuck, no.

47:54.470 --> 47:55.847
It's her.

47:55.930 --> 47:58.015
What is this? This is hearsay.
You don't even have any evidence!

47:58.099 --> 47:59.183
[Caputo] Be quiet.

47:59.726 --> 48:01.246
It's her. I suspected her for a while.

48:07.274 --> 48:08.567
All right.

48:09.693 --> 48:12.071
Take her out, down the hill.

48:12.154 --> 48:13.572
- What?
- You're done.

48:13.655 --> 48:15.324
[Nicky] What the fuck is happening?

48:15.407 --> 48:17.744
Mr. Caputo. What the fuck?

48:17.827 --> 48:20.371
Max! Mr. Caputo! Wait! Wait! Wait!

48:20.454 --> 48:24.291
Wait! Wait! Wait! Max? Fuck! Fuck!

48:24.375 --> 48:26.753
- We will not tolerate this!
- [Nicky yelling]

48:26.836 --> 48:30.965
You bring drugs in here, you
will suffer the consequences.

48:32.174 --> 48:33.550
Yeah.

48:37.054 --> 48:38.514
[softly] They're taking her out?

48:38.597 --> 48:40.357
[Luschek] Let this be
a lesson to all of you.

48:40.432 --> 48:42.518
Drugs destroy lives!

48:42.601 --> 48:45.229
Never trust a fucking junkie!

48:48.524 --> 48:49.525
[Luschek sighs]

48:55.614 --> 48:58.325
Even if the burglary charges are dropped,

48:58.409 --> 49:00.411
you were carrying a lot of heroin.

49:01.662 --> 49:04.791
You're still looking at 5 to
10 years, even if we cop a plea.

49:09.796 --> 49:11.047
Up to 10 years?

49:12.339 --> 49:13.459
What kind of a plea is that?

49:13.465 --> 49:15.467
We'll work on getting
your sentence reduced.

49:15.551 --> 49:16.552
[scoffs]

49:17.428 --> 49:20.848
To what? Only, uh... Only eight years?

49:20.932 --> 49:22.892
Oh, hey, do I get a free mug, too?

49:23.767 --> 49:26.854
[stammers] This... This
is just great, right?

49:26.938 --> 49:29.899
This, this is fucking classic, this guy.

49:29.982 --> 49:31.859
All right, see... So,
you bend over backwards,

49:31.943 --> 49:34.403
and then I'm the one that
winds up getting fucked?

49:34.486 --> 49:36.823
It is the best possible
outcome at this point, Nicky.

49:36.906 --> 49:38.586
Yeah, well, maybe if you'd done something.

49:38.615 --> 49:41.618
I don't know, maybe done something sooner,
it never would have gotten this bad.

49:41.702 --> 49:42.912
What are you talking about? What?

49:42.995 --> 49:44.538
All right, come on, right?

49:44.621 --> 49:46.874
I have a problem.

49:46.958 --> 49:49.543
I needed help, you just gave me money!

49:49.626 --> 49:51.963
I gave you money so you wouldn't steal.

49:52.046 --> 49:54.090
Apparently not enough.

49:54.173 --> 49:57.343
What was I supposed to do,
Nicky, lock you in a tower?

49:57.426 --> 49:58.510
[Nicky sighs]

49:58.594 --> 50:01.722
All the rehabs, all the promises...

50:01.805 --> 50:04.141
And it's not just the drugs.

50:04.225 --> 50:06.018
It's something about the way you're wired.

50:06.102 --> 50:10.731
You have this... unquenchable
thirst to self-destruct.

50:11.858 --> 50:14.276
And, you know, someday you will.

50:14.360 --> 50:16.820
Hey, uh, on the bright side,
at least I'm going to jail,

50:16.904 --> 50:20.574
so, you know, I'll be
out of your hair, huh?

50:20.657 --> 50:22.701
You think that makes me happy?

50:22.784 --> 50:25.037
I don't know. I don't know.

50:26.372 --> 50:28.916
I'm your mother. I love you.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.293
- But I am no match for you.
- [scoffs]

50:32.794 --> 50:35.089
Only you can save yourself
at this point, Nicky.

50:35.172 --> 50:36.757
So you can decide to take yourself on,

50:36.840 --> 50:40.761
or you can let this thing
play out until it kills you.

50:40.844 --> 50:42.638
I'm not the enemy.

50:42.721 --> 50:43.764
Uh-huh?

50:43.847 --> 50:45.266
I never was.

50:46.308 --> 50:47.393
[sighs]

50:47.476 --> 50:48.769
Right.

50:50.312 --> 50:52.106
[sobbing]

50:56.860 --> 50:59.446
You look exhausted. Rough day at work?

51:00.656 --> 51:02.074
What the fuck are you doing here?

51:03.993 --> 51:05.327
What's that?

51:05.411 --> 51:07.955
Business plan, Management and Corrections.

51:09.123 --> 51:11.000
It's a prison corporation.

51:11.083 --> 51:13.544
They were poking around
Litchfield about a year ago

51:13.627 --> 51:17.006
looking to acquire a women's prison,
but we didn't meet their criteria.

51:17.089 --> 51:18.882
Why would it be any different now?

51:18.966 --> 51:21.635
Because now you know the criteria.

51:21.718 --> 51:23.804
Give them a call, set up a walk-through.

51:23.887 --> 51:26.307
And then what? Lie?

51:26.390 --> 51:27.391
[scoffs]

51:27.474 --> 51:29.726
And you thought my job would be easy.

51:34.231 --> 51:36.067
So long, Beer Can.

51:36.150 --> 51:37.693
See you, Fangs.

51:50.289 --> 51:52.916
- Nicky, baby, what's happening?
- Stay back!

51:53.000 --> 51:54.120
[Red] I need to talk to her!

51:54.168 --> 51:55.711
I need to talk to her!

51:55.794 --> 51:57.796
I'm her mother, God damn it!

51:57.879 --> 51:59.923
Nicky, what happened?
Where did this come from?

52:00.007 --> 52:01.217
I thought you were doing okay.

52:01.300 --> 52:02.551
Wow. I'm a fuck-up, huh?

52:02.634 --> 52:04.636
You know you could have come
to me if you were struggling.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.263
- I know.
- Then why didn't you?

52:06.347 --> 52:08.640
Because that's not what I do,
okay? I love you. [sobbing]

52:10.977 --> 52:12.561
[sobbing] I love you, too.

52:44.968 --> 52:47.054
Down the hill to Max.

52:47.138 --> 52:48.139
All right.

52:49.598 --> 52:50.599
[clears throat]

52:57.398 --> 52:58.482
Hey, Nichols.

53:00.776 --> 53:03.820
You wanted out, you're getting out.

53:04.821 --> 53:06.865
Yeah. How 'bout that?

53:06.948 --> 53:09.951
Hey, look at the bright side.

53:10.036 --> 53:11.412
Can't get any shittier.

53:12.871 --> 53:16.458
I don't know about that,
Penn. I'm very resourceful.

53:16.542 --> 53:18.669
Hmm, well, you know.

53:19.836 --> 53:21.236
Did you say goodbye to your people?

53:21.297 --> 53:22.631
What people?

53:22.714 --> 53:25.217
All the dykes and your mom.

53:25.301 --> 53:27.010
Red's not my mom.

53:28.797 --> 53:30.008
Wouldn't wish that on her.

53:31.265 --> 53:32.766
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

54:19.188 --> 54:21.190
