00:01.635 --> 00:04.538
* Hey, hey, oh *
* Hey, Swizz

00:04.572 --> 00:08.542
* I guess I just woke up on
the right side of the bed, man *

00:08.576 --> 00:11.079
* You know what?
You know what? *
* This is how I feel

00:11.112 --> 00:13.381
* I think I might give away
a million bucks *

00:13.414 --> 00:15.649
* I think I might
give away a brand-new truck *
(laughing)

00:15.683 --> 00:18.486
* 'Cause I feel good,
yeah, I feel good *

00:18.519 --> 00:20.521
* 'Cause I feel good

00:20.554 --> 00:22.823
* I think I might take you
on a shopping spree *

00:22.856 --> 00:25.693
* You in the club, man,
all drinks on me *

00:25.726 --> 00:27.328
(on headphones):
* 'Cause I feel good

00:27.361 --> 00:30.431
* Yeah, I feel good,
'cause I feel good *

00:30.464 --> 00:32.800
* Good Lord, look,
what a beautiful day *

00:32.833 --> 00:35.669
* My enemies ain't here,
they gone away *

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
* I feel good,
everything is okay *

00:37.471 --> 00:39.673
* Feel like givin'
all my money away *

00:39.707 --> 00:42.210
(laughter)
* 'Cause ... broke,
ain't no bread in the hood *

00:42.243 --> 00:45.413
* Look what they did,
they sellin' Feds in the hood *

00:45.446 --> 00:46.680
* I ain't gonna change...

00:46.714 --> 00:48.316
(gunshot)

00:48.349 --> 00:49.817
(panting)

00:49.850 --> 00:51.652
Agent Davison!
I need your help.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.786
Come on!

00:52.820 --> 00:54.288
Come on, come on.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.491
Come on, come on, come on.
Whoa.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.468
I ordered a coffee.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.276
Thank you. Stay warm.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.082
Hey, stranger.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.786
Jackson?

01:25.819 --> 01:26.687
Like the blonde.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.788
Looks good on you.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.125
What are you doing here?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.727
They subpoenaed me for
your 5K1 hearing tomorrow.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.496
I'm one of your
character witnesses.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.331
Can you believe that?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.433
Prosecutor must know we dated.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.335
He's probably hoping
that you have info on me

01:41.369 --> 01:43.637
that'll break the terms
of my deal with the FBI.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.738
Well, joke's
on him, then.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.175
FBI made you end
our relationship.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.842
I had no choice.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.744
You always
have a choice.

01:50.778 --> 01:54.182
The FBI...
those aren't your people.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.850
You can wear the white hat
and pretend all you want,

01:56.884 --> 01:58.519
but they will never
really trust you.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.488
Jackson, I have to go to work.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.756
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.292
Don't mention
that you saw me, okay?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.794
Raven. I know this 5K1
is a big deal for you.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.297
A judge decides
your fate tomorrow--

02:09.330 --> 02:11.365
FBI, jail or freedom.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.666
I got your back.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.734
Always did.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.269
And when this
is all over,

02:15.303 --> 02:17.838
we can pick up
where we left off.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.442
I have to go.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.680
Well, you know
how to find me.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.881
It was good seeing you, Eclipse.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.286
It's been a long time
since someone's called me that.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.523
Well, I always loved that girl.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.857
Still do.

02:43.897 --> 02:47.801
NELSON:
I saw two women grabbing money
that was flying through the air.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.703
It was coming from Barnaby Bank.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.339
The ATM was...

02:51.372 --> 02:52.906
was spewing out cash.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.709
Then I saw the gunman approach.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.878
He fired his weapon.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.847
(gunshot)

02:59.880 --> 03:01.882
The two women were scared off.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.318
I ran out of CTOC.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.887
When Agent Davison
and I got down there...

03:08.689 --> 03:09.790
...there was so much blood.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.625
WOMAN (sobbing):
Help me!

03:12.893 --> 03:14.595
DAVISON:
Which way did
the shooter go?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.796
Around the corner that way.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.498
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.833
Yes, I'm on the corner
of 50th and Pennsylvania Street.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.968
A man's been shot.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.470
MAN (weakly):
Mia, help me.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.944
W... we were

03:30.978 --> 03:32.746
holiday shopping.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.848
Andy stopped
at the ATM

03:34.882 --> 03:36.817
to check his balance.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.820
He was always worried about
overdrawing his account.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.322
Whoa.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.523
Hey, this-this
can't be mine.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.358
I didn't even press anything.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.993
I don't have this much
money in my account.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.963
I saw Mia grabbing cash.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.265
What was Andy doing?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.833
He said...

03:52.866 --> 03:53.867
we shouldn't
take the money.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.470
It wasn't ours.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.971
He wanted to leave.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.007
Now, I know this
is really difficult,

04:00.040 --> 04:03.277
but can you give us
a description of this man?

04:03.311 --> 04:04.912
I couldn't see
the shooter's face from up here.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.848
All I saw was the gun.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.583
I remember his voice.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.918
MAN:
Hey.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.653
Looks like it's
your lucky night.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.054
Now it's mine.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.623
Give me the cash.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.492
Give it to me!

04:18.526 --> 04:20.861
(gunshot)
Andy! No!

04:20.894 --> 04:22.496
Help!

04:22.530 --> 04:25.466
My brother is dead

04:25.499 --> 04:26.934
because I was greedy.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.936
You can't blame yourself
for this.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.838
It's nobody's fault
except the man

04:30.871 --> 04:32.973
who fired
the gun.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.708
Come on, Andy. Andy...
(sirens wailing)

04:34.742 --> 04:36.310
Help's on the way, Andy.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.511
NELSON:
Guys, hurry up!

04:39.046 --> 04:40.714
Okay.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.656
PARAMEDIC:
He's gone.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.895
The guy who shot Andy Wilcox
is still out there.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.030
We'll find him, Nelson.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.299
Elijah and Krumitz
are already on it.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.942
Any luck with that ATM
surveillance footage?

05:08.976 --> 05:12.045
Homicide needs everything
you found, Krummy.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.581
I tapped into the ATM's
video file.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.916
Scrolled through everything
the camera captured.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.386
About an hour before
the shooting, this happened.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.590
The video feed went dead.
Mechanical malfunction?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.425
Malfunction created
by malicious code.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.460
Code that forced the ATM camera

05:26.494 --> 05:28.095
to shut off
at 9:00 p.m. last night.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.797
This ATM was hacked.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.064
Any chance this is Python?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.133
We're awfully close
to the FBI building.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.768
We know that even
though he got into CTOC,

05:34.802 --> 05:35.903
he couldn't breach
our system.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.471
Could this be
attempt number two?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.807
Some kind of long-distance
surveillance?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.709
No, this definitely
isn't Python.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.411
I mean, the coding's
sophisticated,

05:43.444 --> 05:44.445
but not at his level.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.914
Okay. So this is strictly
a cyber bank heist.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.582
Definitely.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.818
All right.
I'll call ViCAP.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.720
Tell 'em this case
now belongs to Cyber.
Yeah.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.124
I combed through Barnaby Bank's
internal network.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.560
The target took control of
the ATM using a whaling attack

05:59.593 --> 06:02.530
on Barnaby Bank CEO
Ashton Wagner.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.865
I'm assuming that has nothing
to do with marine biology.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.500
KRUMITZ:
Correct.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.402
The attack zeros in
on corporate upper management.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.970
The malicious
code I found

06:10.003 --> 06:12.506
showed that the target
had a three-step plan.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.174
Step one: the whaling attack
on Barnaby Bank's CEO.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.810
Step two:
use the CEO's credentials

06:16.844 --> 06:18.546
to own
the bank's network.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.616
And step three: take control
of the ATM through the network.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.684
That's how he shut off
the cameras.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.553
All the target had to do
was send him an e-mail

06:25.586 --> 06:27.421
pretending to be someone
he trusted

06:27.455 --> 06:28.656
When Wagner clicked the link,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.558
the target got
his login credentials,

06:30.591 --> 06:32.526
and just like that, he was
inside the bank's network.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.661
Guys.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.195
Look at the
transaction report

06:35.228 --> 06:36.697
from the ATM
Andy used last night.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.031
At the exact same time

06:38.065 --> 06:39.567
the camera cut out,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.068
the ATM stopped recording
customer transactions.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.636
Instead, it logged the message,

06:42.670 --> 06:44.104
"payback time," over and over.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.639
Every ten minutes.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.876
RYAN: Payback time.
Our hacker was out for revenge.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.043
But revenge for what?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.613
MUNDO:
Yeah, why bother
to hack an ATM

06:52.646 --> 06:53.981
if you're not gonna show up
and collect the money?

06:54.014 --> 06:54.915
KRUMITZ:
Not sure.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.684
But I can tell you
exactly what happened

06:56.717 --> 06:58.686
when Andy put his debit card
in the ATM last night.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.854
RUSSELL:
His card automatically triggered

07:00.888 --> 07:02.956
the ATM to spit out $10,000.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.792
Guys, look what I found.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.460
This ATM wasn't the only
one that was hacked.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.596
Okay, in the last hour,

07:08.629 --> 07:12.199
social media activity
in the District has exploded.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.902
#ATMJackpot
is trending like crazy.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.470
People are posting photos

07:16.504 --> 07:19.206
and videos about
the Barnaby Bank's ATMs

07:19.239 --> 07:20.874
flooding the streets with cash.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.510
RYAN:
This isn't an organized attack.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.111
This is a free-for-all.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.546
MUNDO:
Can we remotely tell
the bank's networks

07:25.579 --> 07:26.614
to shut down the ATMs?

07:26.647 --> 07:27.615
NELSON: Mmm...
(typing)

07:27.648 --> 07:28.949
No.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.551
Every time I send code
to shut them down,

07:30.584 --> 07:31.985
someone overwrites my script.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.787
That must be the target.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.556
You did say he was
still in the system?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.824
So he can stop us

07:36.857 --> 07:38.726
from remotely sending a command,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.828
but he can't stop us from
unplugging the machines, right?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.030
No, he can't.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.798
I'll call the Barnaby Bank CEO.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.199
It's time to go old-school.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.001
Do we think any
Barnaby Bank debit card

07:48.035 --> 07:50.738
can make the ATM
just spit out cash?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.540
No. No, no.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.841
It's not any debit card.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.242
Look at this function
that just launched

07:55.275 --> 07:58.045
in the target's code
when I swiped Andy's card.

07:58.078 --> 08:03.283
Yeah. This is a list of
22,678 Barnaby Bank customers.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.952
If any one of their debit cards

08:04.985 --> 08:07.254
was used in an ATM... jackpot.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.822
All right, so why these people?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.257
Why not all the customers?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.925
They-they have to have
something in common, right?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.160
Okay, let me check something.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.763
These ten people
posted on social media

08:15.796 --> 08:19.032
that their debit cards
triggered their ATM jackpots,

08:19.066 --> 08:23.704
and their names are all
on the list of the 22,678.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.572
KRUMITZ:
Look at this.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.774
There's less than $200
in each one of

08:26.807 --> 08:28.709
their bank accounts.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.610
RUSSELL:
Our hacker is stealing

08:29.643 --> 08:31.679
from the rich and
giving to the poor.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.747
This isn't a bank heist.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.083
We're hunting
a Cyber Robin Hood.

08:41.054 --> 08:47.194
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

08:49.096 --> 08:55.669
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

08:55.703 --> 08:58.806
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:58.839 --> 09:02.910
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:02.943 --> 09:06.980
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:07.014 --> 09:10.751
* And miles...

09:10.784 --> 09:11.785
* Oh, yeah.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.908
A little light reading?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.076
Yeah.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.145
You know, most people
are familiar with

09:38.178 --> 09:39.312
the contemporary version

09:39.346 --> 09:40.781
of Robin Hood.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.349
But in the original version--

09:42.382 --> 09:43.851
Piers Plowman

09:43.884 --> 09:45.686
by William Langland--

09:45.719 --> 09:47.120
the hero is actually trying

09:47.154 --> 09:50.123
to incite a revolt
over hunting privileges.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.692
Hunting privileges?
Right.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.361
And this guy Wat Tyler--
"Robin Hood"--

09:54.394 --> 09:56.764
gave the commoners
a voice.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.099
And the, uh, the unrest erupted

09:59.132 --> 10:01.334
in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381,

10:01.368 --> 10:02.736
but the important thing is,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.204
the revolt began

10:04.237 --> 10:06.173
over a refusal
to pay taxes,

10:06.206 --> 10:08.341
to send the king

10:08.375 --> 10:09.777
a very clear message.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.645
And in our story,
the message being sent

10:11.679 --> 10:13.814
over and over again to the bank
is "payback time."

10:15.015 --> 10:16.416
You're right.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.351
Our Cyber Robin Hood
might be trying

10:18.385 --> 10:20.387
to start an economic revolution.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.355
Right. But here's the deal:

10:22.389 --> 10:25.058
Now, we just unplugged
all of Barnaby Bank's ATMs

10:25.092 --> 10:26.293
in the District.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.062
So our guy's probably going
to be looking for another way

10:29.096 --> 10:30.731
to start his revolution.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.667
And, unfortunately,
the CEO of the bank

10:33.701 --> 10:35.168
refused to shut down
the network.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.436
Well, that was a mistake,
'cause our target

10:36.469 --> 10:38.105
is still in the bank's system.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.973
There are dozens of ways
to steal money.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.408
Right, right, so...

10:41.441 --> 10:42.676
KRUMITZ:
Guys!

10:42.710 --> 10:43.944
Check this out.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.145
Fascinating.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.214
Oh, yeah, that's an envelope.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.249
Uh, we used to send
mail back in the day.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.284
(laughs)

10:51.318 --> 10:52.820
Oh, generational humor.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.287
I get it.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.288
Okay, look.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.757
A bike messenger
just dropped off

10:56.790 --> 10:58.091
this photo in the lobby.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.192
Left it with a security guard.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.194
It was addressed to me,
so I scanned it

11:01.228 --> 11:03.096
and had the original
dusted for prints.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.898
There were none.
Wait, I thought

11:04.932 --> 11:06.734
that you said that the ATM's
camera wasn't recording.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.901
It wasn't,

11:07.935 --> 11:10.203
but our target was clearly
watching when Andy got shot.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.805
This is a screen grab

11:11.839 --> 11:13.774
from the ATM
surveillance camera's feed.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.309
Why would our target
be watching?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.245
He wanted to see the joy
on people's face

11:18.278 --> 11:21.081
when that ATM started
spitting out cash.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.116
Andy Wilcox's murder
was an unintended consequence

11:23.150 --> 11:25.085
of his hack.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.221
He wants to help us
find the killer.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.257
Krumitz, take that to Major
Crime, see if they can get

11:30.290 --> 11:31.324
a hit on the shooter's face.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.293
Okay, great.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.195
I've never chased
a gray hat hacker before.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.030
Well, Cyber Robin Hood
might have been

11:37.064 --> 11:38.265
driven by good intentions,

11:38.298 --> 11:40.400
but his hack had
deadly consequences.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.471
That makes him just as dangerous
as any black hat.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.306
Oh, it's true. I like that one.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.507
Get us up to speed, Raven.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.409
Okay, ToggleFly is
going nuts again.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.179
All over D.C.,
people are posting about

11:52.212 --> 11:55.182
getting random amounts of cash
deposited in their accounts.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.186
NELSON:
I've been going through all the
names on the list of 22,678.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.923
Weird thing is some people are
getting deposits, some aren't.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.893
The people who are receiving
money got this alert:

12:05.926 --> 12:08.962
"Congrats. As a valued member
of Barnaby Bank,

12:08.996 --> 12:11.765
you've been selected
to receive a cash refund."

12:11.799 --> 12:13.366
You see how he used
the word "refund"?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.936
A refund for what?

12:15.969 --> 12:16.970
I don't know.
I mean,

12:17.004 --> 12:18.071
the deposited amounts
are different.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.940
Yeah, but it looks like
every single one

12:19.973 --> 12:23.043
of these refunds
either ends in a zero or a five.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.077
MUNDO:
Hey, guys?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.879
Check this out.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.447
WAGNER: Until we have caught
the responsible party,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.550
Barnaby Bank has
shut down every ATM

12:30.583 --> 12:32.319
and suspended all accounts.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.554
Uh, for the safety
of our customers,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.223
no deposits, withdraws

12:36.256 --> 12:38.258
or transfers will be allowed

12:38.291 --> 12:39.793
until this issue is resolved.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.062
We're working with the FBI
to get our system

12:42.095 --> 12:44.064
up and running
as soon as possible.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.365
Thank you.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.867
KRUMITZ:
Freezing everyone's accounts

12:46.900 --> 12:47.968
won't do anything, dude.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.837
Robin Hood owns your network.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.072
He can just unfreeze
the accounts any time he wants.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.473
Hey, Elijah,
you seeing this?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.808
Your name's on the list.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.910
MUNDO:
It's not me.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.012
Did you get a Barnaby Bank
refund from Robin Hood?

12:59.046 --> 13:01.548
No. No, I got way more
than $200 in that account.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.318
(electronic whooshing)

13:07.287 --> 13:08.989
That's awkward.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.091
Ah, four grand
in the last two weeks

13:11.124 --> 13:12.860
on flowers,

13:12.893 --> 13:15.996
hotels, jewelry-- I mean,
I didn't buy any of that stuff.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.130
Well, I didn't, either.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.366
Well, if neither of us
made those purchases, who did?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.501
I don't know yet.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.103
Do you think this has
something to do

13:23.136 --> 13:25.338
with the Barnaby Bank stuff
that's been on the news?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.340
I... Maybe.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.409
I... We're investigating
that case right now.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.011
Was our account hacked?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.946
No. I checked.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.314
I called the bank,
alerted them to the issue.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.448
They're conducting
an internal investigation.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.951
But if I didn't find anything,
they're not going to.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.354
I can't even remember the last
time I used this debit card.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.556
When's the last time
you used it?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.492
Uh, not recently.
Months ago, maybe?

13:45.525 --> 13:47.327
Thank you for coming
all the way down here.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.495
I really appreciate it.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.063
Yeah, no, I figured

13:50.097 --> 13:52.365
you'd need your debit card
and driver's license.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.533
Thank you for returning these.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.870
Your receipt is your bar tab,
and I closed it out for you.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.206
Well, I hope you gave
yourself a good tip.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.373
Um, hey,

14:00.407 --> 14:02.042
uh...

14:02.075 --> 14:04.477
you think maybe I could get you
a cup of coffee sometime?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.314
Uh, listen, Nina, uh...

14:07.347 --> 14:09.249
I'm married.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.151
I just don't...

14:11.184 --> 14:12.485
Yeah, no, of course.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.154
Thank you.

14:18.926 --> 14:22.295
I got it. Somebody had
possession of my card.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.364
Wait, you lost it?
No, I left it at a...

14:24.397 --> 14:25.365
Don't worry about it.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.366
I got it.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.434
I'll figure this out.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.505
NELSON:
Good news.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.974
Hmm?
Major Crime used
screen grabs

14:34.007 --> 14:35.642
from the ATM's camera
to I.D. the shooter.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.444
They made an arrest.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.612
You track down our Cyber Robin
Hood in the bank's network yet?

14:39.646 --> 14:43.350
No, I've been through
the entire network twice.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.018
Mmm...

14:45.052 --> 14:46.519
Nelson, do you ever think
about what you're gonna do

14:46.553 --> 14:48.021
when you finish
your sentence here?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.290
Think I want to stay
at the FBI.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.491
Two of us

14:51.524 --> 14:53.293
taking down
bad guys together?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.461
Sexy.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.364
I'm kind of looking forward
to having my real life back.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.399
You know?
Yeah.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.535
It's like a parole
island here.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.374
Yeah, I feel you.
But I'd miss you if you...

15:07.407 --> 15:09.609
KRUMITZ:
Refund!

15:09.642 --> 15:11.611
Refund.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.580
Cyber Robin Hood
used the word "refund."

15:13.613 --> 15:16.349
Not "reward,"
not "cash back." "Refund.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.485
He's refunding overdraft fees.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.654
The deposits were all
in multiples of $35.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.390
That's why the amounts
were different

15:23.423 --> 15:25.358
and all ended
in a zero or a five.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.727
Robin Hood paid back
each customer

15:27.760 --> 15:30.597
for every $35 overdraft fee
the bank took out.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.532
But those people were paid
thousands of dollars.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.534
They had that many
overdraft charges?

15:34.567 --> 15:38.505
It's frighteningly easy to have
that many overdraft charges.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.541
Banks have a policy,
which is really a scam,

15:41.574 --> 15:43.543
called "check reordering."

15:43.576 --> 15:45.445
Each month,
almost 50% of Americans

15:45.478 --> 15:47.147
write checks
to pay their bills.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.149
Utilities, cable,
stuff like that.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.084
People living
paycheck to paycheck

15:51.118 --> 15:52.585
usually write
their largest check last.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.254
RAMIREZ:
Yeah, like rent.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.523
I deposit my paycheck,
I send in my rent,

15:56.556 --> 15:58.425
hoping that my paycheck clears

15:58.458 --> 16:00.560
before my landlord
deposits my rent check.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.363
KRUMITZ: Right, but what
you're not aware of

16:03.396 --> 16:06.566
is that the banks don't cash
the smaller utility checks

16:06.599 --> 16:10.237
before they've processed
the larger rent check.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.638
It's a scam.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
Banks process
the largest check first,

16:13.506 --> 16:16.143
so that your account gets hit
with not just one,

16:16.176 --> 16:17.644
but multiple overdraft fees.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.312
Robin Hood is

16:19.346 --> 16:20.713
refunding all
the overdraft charges

16:20.747 --> 16:22.582
the bank took through this scam.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.551
He's just trying to
pay the people back.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.021
Give them money that the bank
basically stole from them.

16:28.055 --> 16:31.458
KRUMITZ:
So our Cyber Robin Hood is you.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.026
No, not-not you you.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.062
But someone like you.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.696
Maybe it's just a fed-up
Barnaby Bank customer,

16:36.729 --> 16:38.498
who's out for revenge.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.433
(men grunting)

16:40.467 --> 16:42.502
MAN:
He's got a knife!

16:45.505 --> 16:47.174
WOMAN:
The fight was crazy.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.641
This one guy
was bragging about getting

16:48.675 --> 16:50.643
a cash refund from Barnaby Bank,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.313
making a huge deal
about all his free money.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.549
And another guy got pissed
because he didn't get one.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.485
I don't blame him.
I didn't get one, either.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.287
Anyways, they were arguing.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.821
And one of them threw a punch.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.623
And the other one
pulled a knife.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.358
I can't believe
he stabbed the guy.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.826
RYAN: Our target didn't
think through his plan.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.263
He thought getting people paid
would make them happy.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.665
He didn't account
for human greed.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.402
People are fighting each other
over whether he's a savior

17:15.435 --> 17:16.736
or a criminal?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.538
We got ourselves a problem.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.574
RYAN:
Robin Hood's revolution

17:21.608 --> 17:22.609
has begun.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.294
Nelson and I
spent the entire night

17:41.328 --> 17:42.795
combing through
the bank's network.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.698
Still can't figure out Cyber
Robin Hood's next move.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.834
Got yourself
a new toy, D.B.?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.403
The world's smallest
programmable robot.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.339
You look great, by the way.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.241
Thank you.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.543
I am trying to look
professional before I go

17:56.576 --> 18:00.280
in front of the judge
for my 5K1 hearing.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.483
You given any thought to what
you want to do after?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.118
Honestly, I was...

18:05.152 --> 18:07.787
I was thinking about taking
a job in the private sector.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.856
Yeah, there are a lot
of opportunities for somebody

18:09.889 --> 18:11.791
out there with your skill set.

18:11.824 --> 18:15.895
It's just, I guess I assumed
you were gonna stay here.

18:15.928 --> 18:20.467
Cannot imagine this place
without you, to be honest.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.801
Yeah.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.804
A lot of memories here.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.375
I've come a long way
since I was the young punk

18:28.408 --> 18:30.577
who stumbled in here
two years ago.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.413
* I'm a kerosene drinkin',
Pon Dop, what you thinkin' *

18:33.446 --> 18:36.483
* Hurricane of energy,
HBO brinkin' *

18:36.516 --> 18:38.485
* Turn up the drums...
Can I help you?

18:38.518 --> 18:42.289
Yeah, I'm looking for someone
named Avery Ryan.

18:42.322 --> 18:42.922
Who are you?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.191
Raven Ramirez.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.525
It's my first day.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.295
You're Raven Ramirez?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.762
(chuckles)
Eclipse.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.498
The Eclipse?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.800
Why, do you have something
to say to me, Beardo?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.502
* What, what, what, wh-wh-what,
make it mine... *

18:55.535 --> 18:57.337
I had such attitude.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.672
I thought I knew everything.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.707
You still do.
(laughs)

19:00.740 --> 19:02.609
Hey.
Hey.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.411
You know, whatever you
choose to do, Raven,

19:04.444 --> 19:05.378
you're gonna do great.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.613
Thanks, D.B.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.315
(chiming)

19:09.582 --> 19:11.418
No way.

19:11.451 --> 19:15.455
Someone is claiming to be our
Cyber Robin Hood on ToggleFly.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.389
Look at that.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.325
"Citizens of the District,
stop fighting.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.959
"Do not turn on each other.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
"The bank is our only enemy.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.896
"When I'm done,
the payout will be huge

19:23.930 --> 19:26.499
and the bank will be
brought to its knees."

19:26.533 --> 19:28.801
All right, any way we can track
this to the originating device?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.370
I mean, I'll try,
but my guess

19:30.403 --> 19:32.972
is that the post was routed
through a dozen proxies.

19:33.005 --> 19:33.973
Try.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.476
Hey, you see that?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.878
Looks like
Cyber Robin Hood's next hack.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.584
*

19:51.524 --> 19:53.526
(siren wailing)

19:56.596 --> 20:00.267
(indistinct chatter)

20:00.300 --> 20:02.335
Cyber Robin Hood gained access
to one of Barnaby Bank's

20:02.369 --> 20:03.836
underground parking
structures and stole

20:03.870 --> 20:06.339
a Colton Security
armored truck.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.308
Then he shut down every one
of the surveillance cameras,

20:08.341 --> 20:11.378
using the same code he wrote
to shut down the ATM cams.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.813
So we have no idea exactly
when he pulled this heist.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.849
What we do know
is that $1.2 million

20:16.883 --> 20:18.485
was in the back of the truck.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.020
I mean, why have the cash
just lying around?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.523
When we unplugged the ATMs
to stop Robin Hood's first hack,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.858
it forced Barnaby Bank
to find a place

20:25.892 --> 20:27.394
to store all that extra cash.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.495
RUSSELL:
Right, most banks

20:28.528 --> 20:31.364
keep their cash reserves
in secure offsite locations.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.400
Barnaby Bank kept their cash

20:33.433 --> 20:34.601
in the trucks with the intention

20:34.634 --> 20:36.569
of getting it all
out of the District,

20:36.603 --> 20:39.306
but Cyber Robin Hood
struck first.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.940
All he had to do
was swipe a key card

20:40.973 --> 20:42.442
to steal the armored truck.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.043
NELSON: Police found
the abandoned truck

20:44.076 --> 20:45.645
underneath an overpass;
no prints.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.380
RYAN: Up until now,
both of these hacks--

20:47.414 --> 20:48.948
the ATM and
the overdraft refund--

20:48.981 --> 20:51.551
were both done remotely.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.320
Stealing a truck
is done in person,

20:53.353 --> 20:55.722
which means Robin Hood
is not just a hacker.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.624
He knew where
that money was.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.659
He knew how to get in,
he knew how to get out.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.661
This is an inside job.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.031
I want the names of every
employee who has access

21:05.064 --> 21:07.900
to that underground structure
where that truck was stolen.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.337
*

21:16.643 --> 21:18.645
(door opens)
Hey.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.047
Hi. (chuckles)

21:21.080 --> 21:22.449
Long time, no see.
Hey.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.783
Listen, I was hoping
maybe you could...

21:23.816 --> 21:25.785
help shed some light
on something for me.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.320
Yeah? What's up?

21:27.354 --> 21:29.422
Some odd charges show up
on my debit card.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.825
Lingerie, diamond
earrings...

21:32.859 --> 21:35.528
a stay at the
Rose Garden Inn.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.629
What does that
have to do with me?

21:36.663 --> 21:38.865
The charges were made on
the card I left at the bar.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.700
Did you come
all the way down here

21:40.733 --> 21:42.502
to accuse me
of stealing your card?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.504
Charges were very specific.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.806
You told me you loved staying
at the Rose Garden Inn.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.341
Elijah, I returned
your card to you.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.511
Why would I do that if I was
gonna steal your money?

21:51.544 --> 21:54.013
Did you find any evidence
that I made those purchases?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.115
No.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.584
I didn't do it,
Elijah.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.988
I kind of think
you know that, though.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.524
If you need somebody
to talk to-- as friends,

22:04.557 --> 22:06.693
obviously--

22:06.726 --> 22:08.327
uh, you know where to find me.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.103
*

22:22.775 --> 22:25.878
Jihadi John tried to hide
behind a mask, too.

22:25.912 --> 22:29.749
You know how the CIA
identified Jihadi John?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.684
The veins in his hands.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.822
They used a technique called
optical-based vein uncovering

22:35.855 --> 22:39.726
to map out the structure of his
veins from the beheading videos.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.762
And then they cross-referenced
that vein pattern

22:42.795 --> 22:46.032
with hundreds of thousands of
people's photos on social media.

22:46.065 --> 22:51.070
The human vein is actually
more unique than fingerprints.

22:51.103 --> 22:55.708
Our suspect pool is limited
to the Barnaby Bank employees

22:55.742 --> 22:58.177
who had physical access
to those armored trucks.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.879
Right.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.581
So now all
we have to do is

23:01.614 --> 23:05.051
run the pattern of Robin Hood's
veins in this photo

23:05.084 --> 23:07.420
against security camera footage

23:07.454 --> 23:09.856
of the hand of every employee

23:09.889 --> 23:12.792
who accessed
the armored trucks.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.664
KRUMITZ:
Are you sure this is gonna work?

23:17.697 --> 23:18.831
I have no idea.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.701
Guys, I just found
another vulnerability

23:21.734 --> 23:23.202
in the Barnaby
Bank system.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.472
This one affects
the wire transfers.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.739
Robin Hood can send
as much money as he wants

23:26.773 --> 23:27.574
anywhere in the world.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.576
So the ATM and the
overdraft hacks

23:29.609 --> 23:30.677
might have been just
smoke and mirrors.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.612
This could've been what
he was after the whole time.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.713
I'll loop in Raven.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.047
We need to get
started on a patch.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.618
Whoa, here we go,
got a match.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.821
So we have a time stamp
of when this hand swiped

23:41.854 --> 23:44.156
an I.D. badge
at the bank's garage.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.593
Last Wednesday, 3:23 p.m.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.595
Well, I can cross-reference
the time stamp

23:48.628 --> 23:50.763
with a list of employees
who swiped their card that day.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.500
(typing)

23:53.533 --> 23:55.502
All right, got a badge number.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.670
Say hello to Cyber Robin Hood.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.840
Hello.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.711
FBI!

24:05.878 --> 24:07.079
AJ Kim, FBI!

24:07.113 --> 24:08.515
Hands above
your head.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.582
Slowly stand up.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.754
For the record, I am forgoing
my legal right to remain silent,

24:14.787 --> 24:18.758
and I'm fully cooperating with
the law by not resisting arrest.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.059
My name is AJ Kim,

24:20.092 --> 24:23.262
and I am responsible for
the Barnaby Bank hack.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.833
And I'm more than willing
to go down for my cause.

24:26.866 --> 24:27.867
(handcuffs fastening)

24:33.640 --> 24:36.576
I've been a teller
at Barnaby Bank for five years.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.912
Know how much banks made
in 2014 from overdraft fees?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.982
$35 billion.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.017
Barnaby alone made off
with $7 billion.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.787
Well, that is reprehensible,
but you know what's worse?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.790
A man was murdered
because of your ATM hack.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.025
I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.827
That's why I mailed you guys
the photo of the shooter.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.663
Yes, you did.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.665
And then you decided
to hack the bank again

24:58.698 --> 25:00.667
to give people refunds,

25:00.700 --> 25:03.102
which resulted in another
man being stabbed.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.938
Look, I tried to go
through the proper channels

25:05.972 --> 25:07.740
at the bank years ago.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.075
When I discovered
the overdraft scam,

25:09.108 --> 25:11.077
I went right to my boss.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.011
He dismissed me.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.780
RYAN: Why didn't you go
to law enforcement?

25:13.813 --> 25:14.947
That's what
we're here for.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.283
Five years,
I've been telling mothers

25:17.316 --> 25:19.185
who could barely feed their kids

25:19.218 --> 25:21.320
that I couldn't refund
the excessive overdraft fees.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.789
I did what was right.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.224
I gave the poor a voice.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.259
And the people
are supporting me.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.796
I started a movement.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.732
It will go on,
with or without me.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.734
Oh, you want to be
arrested, don't you?

25:34.767 --> 25:37.203
So you can martyr yourself
for this cause,

25:37.236 --> 25:39.071
'cause you want your name
and your picture

25:39.105 --> 25:40.272
plastered everywhere.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.241
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.911
I will make sure the press
never gets a photo of you,

25:44.944 --> 25:46.913
that the name AJ Kim

25:46.946 --> 25:49.148
is never associated
with this bank hack.
(cell phone chimes)

25:49.181 --> 25:50.817
Avery?

25:53.953 --> 25:55.922
I just got this alert.

25:55.955 --> 25:59.225
Just got $100,000 transferred
into my Barnaby Bank account.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.760
How's that possible?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.195
AJ was in our custody
when this happened.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.164
Who are you working with?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.198
No one.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.133
What are you talking about?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.836
Agent Mundo just got
$100,000 transferred

26:09.869 --> 26:11.871
into his Barnaby Bank account.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.606
Who else did you
transfer money to?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.708
I didn't do that.

26:17.877 --> 26:18.678
What have you got?

26:18.711 --> 26:21.313
$100,000 was just
wired electronically

26:21.347 --> 26:24.316
to every Barnaby Bank
customer in the D.C. area.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.619
(sighs)
That's over
300,000 people.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.355
Somebody just bankrupted
Barnaby Bank.

26:29.388 --> 26:32.692
And I don't think it's our
Cyber Robin Hood, AJ Kim.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.360
He looked surprised
when I told him.

26:34.393 --> 26:37.029
Yeah, well, we have a
slightly bigger problem

26:37.063 --> 26:39.198
than the emergence
of a second hacker.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.901
Uh, all of the money
was funneled

26:41.934 --> 26:45.204
through a vulnerability
that Raven said she'd patched.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.207
Now, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation, but...

26:48.240 --> 26:50.009
Well, I really
hope there is.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.778
RAMIREZ: I don't know
what to tell you, Avery.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.346
I patched that vulnerability.
Check the bank's network.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.248
We did.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.084
The fact is your patch
is not there.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.186
You think I stole the money?

27:00.219 --> 27:02.288
We're just trying to determine
what actually happened.
(cell phone chimes)

27:04.056 --> 27:05.257
Okay, I just got an alert.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.893
The FBI has not been
able to monitor

27:06.926 --> 27:08.294
your cell phone activity
since yesterday.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.862
Do you have any idea
why that might be?

27:09.896 --> 27:11.263
No.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.332
Are you interrogating me?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.003
Take my phone.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.405
Okay? I have
nothing to hide.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.173
Why would I commit a hack

27:21.207 --> 27:24.310
a couple of hours
before my 5K1 hearing?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.345
I mean, that's what you're
accusing me of, right?

27:26.378 --> 27:27.880
We're not accusing you
of hacking anything.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.716
NELSON: Sorry to interrupt,
but I have proof

27:29.749 --> 27:32.051
that Raven patched
the vulnerability.
Thank you.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.787
These are event logs showing
activity on the bank's network.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.790
Now, at 1:07 p.m.,
Raven added her code.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.026
An hour later,
it was deleted.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.362
But it would take another hacker
years to find Raven's patch

27:43.395 --> 27:46.699
amongst a half million lines
of code in the bank network.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.068
Unless the hacker knew
exactly what to look for.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.369
I know
who did this.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.341
I used a sequence of code
another black hat taught me.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.709
Who?

27:58.510 --> 28:01.413
Jackson.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.950
Jackson Richmond,
your ex-boyfriend?

28:03.983 --> 28:06.352
But you cut off all
contact with him

28:06.385 --> 28:08.420
when you started working
the Cyber Crime Division.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.756
I did.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.090
But he tracked me down
yesterday.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.292
He's in D.C. for my 5K1 hearing.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.961
Wait, you saw him?

28:14.994 --> 28:16.796
He found me.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.265
I tried to get away, tried
to tell him I couldn't talk.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.834
We literally had
a two-minute conversation.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.969
AVERY: Raven, did
you speak to him

28:23.002 --> 28:24.470
about the Barnaby Bank case?

28:24.503 --> 28:26.138
No, of course not.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.475
Besides, I saw him before
we started working on this.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.945
I don't know how he figured out
that I wrote that code.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.247
Probably hacked your phone
when he saw you yesterday.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.916
That would explain why
your phone isn't connected

28:36.949 --> 28:39.485
to the FBI network--
Jackson's controlling it.

28:39.518 --> 28:43.355
But how would Jackson have known
to hack me for the bank exploit?

28:43.389 --> 28:46.492
No, no, he hacked you
to keep tabs on you.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.494
The exploit
was a bonus.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.197
Then he wired the bank's money
to make it look like

28:51.230 --> 28:52.498
it was part of the
Robin Hood hack.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.266
MUNDO:
It was camouflage.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.403
He knew if he wired money just
to himself, then we'd track it,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.839
but now he's a needle
in a haystack of wire transfers.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.244
Didn't realize you saw Jackson.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.914
I told you,
he ambushed me.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.248
Yeah, how was it?

29:09.281 --> 29:10.950
Seeing him after
all this time?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.520
Weird.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.522
We were together
for five years.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.957
We thought we were unstoppable.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.393
Fantasized
about big hacks,

29:21.427 --> 29:25.264
stealing millions and traveling
the world together.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.400
Looks like he's still trying
to make that fantasy a reality.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.036
Jackson hacked you through
your phone command.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.904
FEMALE VOICE:
Hello. What can I help you with?

29:31.938 --> 29:33.439
I hardly ever use Isla.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.541
Yeah, well, according to
your phone logs, you did.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.209
Yesterday morning
at 9:30 a.m.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.945
That's when
I saw Jackson.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.580
He didn't have any physical
access to my phone.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.449
How could he have
activated Isla?

29:43.482 --> 29:44.583
Were your headphones
plugged into your phone

29:44.616 --> 29:45.584
when you saw him yesterday?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.586
Yeah. Why?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.455
(sighs)
He hacked you remotely.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.423
Used your headphones
as an antenna.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.126
He only had to be
within six feet of you.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.962
With his laptop.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.964
I mean, using radio waves,

29:57.997 --> 29:59.966
he silently triggered
voice commands on your phone.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.301
He forced your phone
to launch a Web site

30:02.334 --> 30:04.070
that was already corrupted
with his malware.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.105
See?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.909
RAMIREZ: Eclipse and Prodigy,
those are our hacker handles.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.944
I cannot believe
he did this to me.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.613
Love makes you do stupid things.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.483
Like Jackson not
anonymizing himself

30:17.516 --> 30:19.351
when he registered
the Web site domain.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.520
Right? I got a I.P. address
for the device

30:21.553 --> 30:23.522
he was using to spy on you.
(taps key)

30:23.555 --> 30:26.492
And let's see if we can get
a location, hmm?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.162
RAMIREZ:
The FBI headquarters?

30:30.196 --> 30:33.432
He's there testifying as
a character witness for my 5K1.

30:33.465 --> 30:37.569
I mean... why would he hack
a bank and stay in D.C.?

30:37.603 --> 30:39.438
He did this for you.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.940
This is all about you.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.375
Most guys don't like
meeting their girl's ex.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.410
I'm looking forward to it.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.529
I, uh, thought you
couldn't be seen with me

31:03.562 --> 31:04.931
until after your 5K1.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.165
It's over.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.466
I just met with the judge.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.567
Whatever you said helped.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.136
What, so you're free?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.337
I'm free.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.206
So, uh, what's next, Eclipse?

31:14.240 --> 31:16.208
You, uh, you gonna keep
that white hat on?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.343
No.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.679
No, I am done with the FBI.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.350
Seeing you again...
brought back

31:24.383 --> 31:26.218
all of our
good memories.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.686
And I realized I...

31:27.719 --> 31:30.689
I want to be with you.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.291
Really?

31:32.324 --> 31:34.460
'Cause, uh, you didn't seem
so convinced yesterday.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.963
I still had my 5K1
looming over me.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.466
And, Jackson, you
caught me by surprise.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.236
You're the only one
who gets me.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.239
The real me, Eclipse.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.376
I've been pretending
to be someone else

31:50.409 --> 31:53.345
for the last two years.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.381
(over speaker):
I'm tired of living a lie.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.649
JACKSON: Are you sure you're
ready to leave all this behind?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.551
I mean, you got a pretty
cushy life here.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.121
I don't want you
to have regrets.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.523
RAMIREZ: The only regret I have
is ending our relationship.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.328
I love you, Jackson.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.030
I never stopped.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.204
It's all part of
the sting, Nelson.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.705
She's just
playing her part.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.642
You two are the worst-kept
secret in D.C.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.177
(chuckles)

32:27.679 --> 32:30.016
JACKSON: I've waited
two years for that.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.051
And, as always,
you never disappoint.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.722
Uh, time to book
two tickets to Geneva.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.057
Can you leave
tonight?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.591
Tonight?
What's the rush?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.493
You remember that big hack
we always talked about?

32:41.527 --> 32:43.262
Yeah.
I did it.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.730
Set up a whole bunch
of dummy accounts

32:44.763 --> 32:46.332
and cleaned Barnaby Bank out.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.368
We've got $5 million, tax-free.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.009
You really haven't changed
at all, Prodigy.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.245
OFFICER:
Jackson Richmond!

32:59.278 --> 33:00.612
Don't move!

33:05.284 --> 33:08.487
Jackson Richmond, you're under
arrest for cyber bank fraud.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.588
You set me up?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.758
But I did it for us.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.260
There is no "us."

33:23.569 --> 33:25.637
MUNDO:
Suspect is in custody.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.348
(sighs)

33:36.382 --> 33:38.250
NELSON: I'm sorry
you had to do that.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.287
I know he meant a lot to you.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.157
He did.

33:45.191 --> 33:48.627
But Jackson is my past.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.298
I want something different
for my future.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.371
RAMIREZ: When I was 15,
I dropped out of school,

33:59.405 --> 34:02.241
left home,

34:02.274 --> 34:05.077
became a hacker to survive.

34:05.111 --> 34:07.746
I never really felt
like I belonged anywhere,

34:07.779 --> 34:09.448
until I started

34:09.481 --> 34:13.152
working for the
Cyber Crime Division.

34:13.185 --> 34:16.155
I can't thank
Deputy Director Ryan enough

34:16.188 --> 34:18.324
for making me a member
of her family.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.792
Thank you,
Miss Ramirez.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.561
Deputy Director Ryan,

34:22.594 --> 34:24.696
what is your recommendation
regarding sentencing?

34:24.730 --> 34:28.200
RYAN: Your Honor, it's
been my pleasure working

34:28.234 --> 34:31.203
with Miss Ramirez
for the past two years.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.204
During that time,

34:32.238 --> 34:35.073
she's become an invaluable
member of my team.

34:36.375 --> 34:40.279
But recent events
have led me to believe that...

34:40.312 --> 34:43.182
she could benefit from more time

34:43.215 --> 34:44.850
with the Cyber
Crime Division.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.418
Are you saying
she hasn't provided you

34:46.452 --> 34:47.586
with substantial assistance?

34:59.698 --> 35:01.700
(indistinct chattering,
laughing)

35:03.302 --> 35:04.270
(sighs)

35:04.303 --> 35:05.471
Oh, hey!
Hey.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.572
Perfect timing.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.574
We're just about
to sit down for dinner.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.343
This is my friend Nina,
from spin class.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.311
She's gonna join us.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812
NINA:
Devon, this is so crazy.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.348
Elijah and I actually
know each other.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.217
He comes to my
bar all the time.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.486
I used to come
to her bar.

35:22.388 --> 35:25.357
It was a pretty regular
thing there for a while.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.325
Like when your
dad was sick.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.460
You know what, actually,
you would be surprised

35:28.494 --> 35:29.795
how many people
would rather talk

35:29.828 --> 35:31.330
to a bartender
than a therapist.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.864
I feel like I'm
ready for my degree.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.301
So much for the
working-late excuses.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.769
I was working late.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.671
I stopped for one drink.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.641
And a little therapy,
apparently.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.476
Devon...
NINA:
Okay, I'm sorry.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.246
I didn't mean to, um, cause
any problems, so I'm gonna go,

35:47.279 --> 35:49.681
and I'll just see you in
class, like, on Friday?

35:49.715 --> 35:51.183
Yeah.
Thanks.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.726
(door opens, closes)

36:00.759 --> 36:03.229
You need to stop
hanging out with her.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.663
Oh, what, we-we can't
share friends?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.832
That girl is crazy.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.367
She's the one
who stole our card.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.269
She's responsible
for all those charges.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.404
Wait, you think Nina
stole our card?

36:12.438 --> 36:13.872
I confronted her about it today.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.608
She denied it, and now, hours
later, she's in our kitchen.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.477
You don't think
that's a little weird?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.612
I think it's a little weird
that you've been sharing

36:20.646 --> 36:23.415
our family's private problems
with a stranger.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.417
(scoffs)
You see what's going on here?

36:25.451 --> 36:26.485
You see what she started?

36:26.518 --> 36:29.388
Elijah, is there something
more you want to tell me?

36:31.423 --> 36:33.392
No, don't go jumping
to conclusions, Devon.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.893
I have not done anything wrong.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.464
Well, for someone who hasn't
done anything wrong,

36:38.497 --> 36:40.599
you're definitely acting
like you have.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.437
(sighs)

36:49.675 --> 36:51.743
You should have told me
you saw Jackson yesterday.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.413
I told you, he showed
up out of nowhere.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.647
I cut the conversation short.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.517
That one mistake...

36:58.550 --> 37:01.720
shouldn't outweigh the last
two years I've worked for you.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.256
A-And if I had told you,
you would have punished me

37:04.290 --> 37:06.658
for breaking
the terms of my deal.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.395
No, I would have rewarded you
for your honesty.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.398
That's what this is
all about, Raven.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.000
We could have prevented a lot of
what happened to the bank today.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.668
We would have
analyzed your phone

37:16.702 --> 37:18.537
to see if Jackson
hacked you.

37:18.570 --> 37:22.308
Keeping this from me
has had serious consequences.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.442
You don't trust me.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.277
I do trust you.

37:26.312 --> 37:29.415
I just don't trust your
judgment.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.782
You're still young.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.050
I'm not Tobin, Avery.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.053
I put Jackson...

37:35.086 --> 37:38.724
Jackson behind bars today.

37:38.757 --> 37:42.928
Doesn't that mean that I've
put my past behind me?

37:42.961 --> 37:45.431
Doesn't that count
for something?

37:54.806 --> 37:57.343
(sighs)

38:01.780 --> 38:04.483
RYAN: You ever feel like a
villain in your own story?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.818
I imagine the Sheriff
of Nottingham

38:06.852 --> 38:08.654
could relate to that sentiment.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.823
What's going on?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.761
Raven's verdict just came in.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.966
She has to serve the rest
of her sentence-- two years.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.501
Here at the FBI?

38:27.038 --> 38:30.609
The judge asked me a question,

38:30.642 --> 38:34.546
and if I had
answered it truthfully,

38:34.580 --> 38:36.047
it would have meant
Raven's release.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.552
So I didn't answer it at all.
Wow.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.654
You have to trust your gut.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.658
I hired Raven... so that
she would feel empowered,

38:46.692 --> 38:48.994
so that she would know
what it feels like

38:49.027 --> 38:51.597
to use her talent for good.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.466
Avery, come on.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.935
Raven could have run off
with that Jackson fellow

38:56.968 --> 38:58.937
and the $5 million,
but she didn't.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.472
She chose to turn him in.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.608
That's your influence on her.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.512
I know she's mad at me.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.482
But in my heart,

39:10.516 --> 39:12.618
I know that Raven is not
ready to leave here.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.653
What you had
to do today,

39:14.686 --> 39:16.354
that was hard.

39:18.824 --> 39:23.662
I know it's not much
consolation, but...

39:23.695 --> 39:25.664
one of these days,
Raven's gonna realize

39:25.697 --> 39:27.666
you were just
looking out for her.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
I'm sure of that, Avery.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.040
I know.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.808
But I need a drink.
(laughs)

39:36.842 --> 39:38.109
(chuckles)

39:38.143 --> 39:39.945
Care to join me?

39:44.983 --> 39:47.953
Just, uh...

39:47.986 --> 39:49.621
don't tell my boss.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.657
(laughs)

39:51.690 --> 39:55.594
If you give me a long pour,
your secret's safe with me.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.579
Now I know why I hired you.

40:13.612 --> 40:17.649
My...
immeasurable charm?

40:17.683 --> 40:20.051
No, it's your terrific scotch.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.688
(laughs)

40:22.721 --> 40:24.756
(Italian accent):
That's-a some good coffee.

40:24.790 --> 40:25.791
(both laugh)
