10:12.293 --> 10:15.293
Well, you should have thought about that

10:15.294 --> 10:20.271

we'll have reverend mcdaniel giving us seven types of shit.

10:20.295 --> 10:23.295

10:23.296 --> 10:25.816
Mr. Vickers, I'm dci Holland.
You're gonna have to come with us.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.297
How serious is this?

10:28.298 --> 10:32.298
Mr. Vickers, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of manslaughter.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.376
You do not have to say anything, though it
may harm your defense if you do not mention,

10:35.400 --> 10:39.300
when questioned, something that you'll later rely on
in court. Anything you say may be given in evidence.

10:39.301 --> 10:41.301
Do you have any questions-no-fantastic.

10:41.302 --> 10:44.302

11:52.310 --> 11:57.310
We found out where he lives. He
only made bail a few hours ago, Bob.

11:57.789 --> 12:01.311
You find him and you finish him. Right?

12:08.312 --> 12:12.312

12:58.316 --> 12:59.316

13:23.323 --> 13:25.323
You're a hero, huh?

13:26.324 --> 13:29.324
Cause I bet when they let you out on bail, you cant wait to
tell your missus you'd never guess what happend to me? Did they?

13:29.325 --> 13:33.325
I stopped a robbery. I killed one
of them, as well. What's for dinner?

13:35.326 --> 13:39.326
Suppose I mention the lad, you killed his
brother, is right in there with your missus.

13:40.327 --> 13:43.327
Come on now, don't be like
that. You need a line a fella

13:43.328 --> 13:45.609
you can't go through life
without a grin once in a while.

13:46.329 --> 13:49.329
So why don't you give
us a really big smile.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.330
Now go start the car.

14:22.331 --> 14:26.651
Fuck that, man, I want to see them go up rude way. You
know, it was the mean old fuckers who done you, right.

14:36.332 --> 14:38.332
You're very lucky, mate

14:39.333 --> 14:44.333
see, I didn't get to say goodbye to my little brother
after you smashed his fuckin' head in with that bat.

14:46.334 --> 14:48.334
But I'm gonna let you say goodbye to 'er.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.335
Cause I'm a nice guy.

14:51.336 --> 14:55.336
See, I did you a little
favor. You're not my size.

14:57.337 --> 15:01.337
I put a little more petrol... on the bitch.

15:01.338 --> 15:04.338
Now, hopefully she lights off first.

15:17.339 --> 15:19.339
For me, it's holding her...

15:21.340 --> 15:25.340
Don't worry, georgy.
I'll turn the heatin' up.

15:46.341 --> 15:48.341
How ya feelin'?

15:49.342 --> 15:53.342
You're not doin' yourself any favors by
beatin' the shit out of people for info.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.343
Yeah, well. Somebody knows something.

15:56.344 --> 16:01.344
Well, maybe they do. But doing this job for 6 years, you realize
it's every neighbor's god-given right to turn a blind eye.

16:01.345 --> 16:03.345
For fear of gettin' a knife in their belly.

16:03.746 --> 16:06.346
- So, stop poking around.
- And what have you got?

16:06.347 --> 16:10.347
Nothing... no one's talking.

16:11.348 --> 16:15.348
One of the neighbors said they heard some
commotion about 11. Thought it was the TV.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.349
Then called the fire brigade at 11:30
when they saw the garage going up.

16:18.350 --> 16:21.350
Saw a black BMW speedin' off.

16:23.351 --> 16:28.351
There's been a couple of attacks like the one
your old man stopped. We think it's the same lot.

16:28.352 --> 16:31.352
Whoever they are, people are scared, Jimmy.

16:32.353 --> 16:33.353
Were they alive?

16:36.354 --> 16:37.354
Jimmy, mate... don't...

16:37.355 --> 16:39.355
Were they burnt alive?

16:42.356 --> 16:45.356
Postmortem suggests
they burnt to death, yes.

16:48.357 --> 16:50.357
Have you seen Morgan since you got back?

16:50.358 --> 16:53.358
No... I haven't signed the divorce papers.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.359
Can you get the cctv footage?

16:55.360 --> 16:58.360
Jimmy, I've seen it, mate.
It's just weird rabbit masks.

17:02.361 --> 17:04.361
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.362
Jimmy...

17:16.363 --> 17:19.363
He stood his ground... your old man.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.364
When did ya get back?

18:24.365 --> 18:25.365
Friday.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.366
You missed the funeral.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.367
Tryin' to make up for it.

18:30.368 --> 18:34.368
I e-mailed you four... five times, Jimmy.

18:35.369 --> 18:37.369
I had a combat mission in helmand.

18:39.370 --> 18:43.370
Your commanding officer said
you'd been arrested and detained.

18:47.371 --> 18:48.371
What happened?

18:52.372 --> 18:54.372
You know I can't tell you, Morgan.

18:54.373 --> 18:56.373
Oh, I think you can, Jimmy.

18:56.374 --> 19:00.374
Especially when I have to arrange and
cover for you at your own parents' funeral.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.375
Wait!

19:10.376 --> 19:11.376
Sorry.

19:12.377 --> 19:14.377
You don't have to be on your own.

19:16.378 --> 19:18.378
Stop by the flat, sometime. Ok?

19:38.379 --> 19:41.379
- Hey, yeah, you on my best case?
- Fuck, man.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa... who the fuck is this?

19:46.385 --> 19:52.381
- Hey, this is Ronnie, we go out he just want some fooz -hey, I heard your stuff's awesome, fella.
- Then get the fuck out of here.

19:52.450 --> 19:54.382
Bring him up to Caleb's in business hours.

19:54.383 --> 19:56.543
- Yeah?
- Well, and they want half-an-ounce, I suppose.

19:57.384 --> 19:58.384
We having a party.

20:09.385 --> 20:10.385
Well, that takes money.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.386
These are 400. What the fuck!
I said 500.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.387
Your guy told us four.
We only got four on us.

20:26.388 --> 20:29.388
- We could-we'll just get four hundred's worth.
- I said I'd get half-an-ounce.

20:29.389 --> 20:34.389
I tell you what. You run me the four
bills and let me see your wifey's breasts.

20:41.390 --> 20:44.390
- Naw, man. Look, let's just get four hundred's worth, yeah?
- No deal.

20:44.391 --> 20:45.391
Babe, let's just go.

20:46.392 --> 20:48.392
Babe, we need this gear.

20:49.393 --> 20:52.393
I ain't asking for
much, just a quick flash.

20:52.394 --> 20:54.394
You ain't even wearin' a bra.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.475
This guy is sick, you know.

21:04.396 --> 21:07.396
You actualy thought I'd gonna give
you a hundred pounds worth of gear?

21:07.397 --> 21:09.757
- For a quick look at your girlfriend's tits?
- I did, yeah.

21:10.398 --> 21:13.398
Look, we're gettin' out of here.
Just give me my money back.

21:13.399 --> 21:14.399
You ain't going nowhere.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
That's crazy, you know.

21:23.401 --> 21:26.401
You get the gear when she sucks my cock.

21:29.402 --> 21:30.402
No! Leave him! Don't!

21:31.403 --> 21:33.403
- T-stop!
- Take off your top.

21:37.404 --> 21:40.404
They'll stop wailin' him
in when you start suckin'.

21:43.405 --> 21:46.405
- Wait! Leave him! She's up for it.
- Dickhead.

21:55.406 --> 21:57.446
Go on. You know, I've got
to record that shit, love.

21:58.407 --> 22:00.407
Wow, wow. What the fuck!

22:01.408 --> 22:06.408
I told you to suck this dick. Do it properly
or I'll throw you through the window.

22:08.409 --> 22:09.449
And you won't get no gear.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.410
Mr Evans?

22:29.411 --> 22:30.411
What the fuck you want?

22:30.412 --> 22:33.412
Mr. Evans. We've had reports of a
disturbance at this address a few hours ago.

22:33.413 --> 22:34.413
So what?

22:34.414 --> 22:37.414
- Mr. Evans, have you been home all night?
- Yeah.

22:37.415 --> 22:40.935
We have reason to believe that a man has been
assaulted on your premises. Mr. Ryan Scott.

22:42.416 --> 22:43.416
Don't ring a bell?

22:43.417 --> 22:44.417
Can we come in?

22:44.418 --> 22:46.418
Get the fuck out of here!

22:46.419 --> 22:48.419
Mr. Evans, there's a young man in
hospital whose been quite badly beaten.

22:48.420 --> 22:51.420
So what? It don't have fuck to do with me.

22:51.421 --> 22:55.421
So take your little fuck-puppet here
and get the fuck away from my yard.

23:03.422 --> 23:07.422
Don't be a stranger now sweetheart. You come
back around here, anytime you want, yeah?

23:09.423 --> 23:12.123
- What was that?
- You heard.

23:14.124 --> 23:18.124
What different reality do you honestly think I would
be interested in a Tommy-sack of shit like you.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.125
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

23:19.126 --> 23:24.126
Go on, girl. You have peace with 'em. Rail her
in. You get that little pit bull a leash, yeah?

23:25.127 --> 23:28.127
Oi! Jenny, wait up.

23:31.128 --> 23:34.688
You can't let them get to you. We know he did
it and we're gonna get him get away with it.

23:35.129 --> 23:37.129
You've been a constable for five minutes.

23:38.130 --> 23:41.130
Wanna make a difference? Climb the ladder.

23:49.131 --> 23:51.131
I'll be in the car.

25:03.132 --> 25:08.132
The owner of the black BMW is a
Warren Evans, 3305 south Avenue.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.133
You sure it's him?

25:14.134 --> 25:16.134
Warren Evans had a younger brother, Joshua

25:18.135 --> 25:22.135
Joshua Evans was accidentally killed
two weeks ago during an attempted robbery

25:22.136 --> 25:24.136
after receiving a blow to the head.

25:26.137 --> 25:28.137
From your old man.

26:50.138 --> 26:51.138
Hello?

26:54.139 --> 26:56.139
What the fuck! Huh?

26:57.140 --> 27:00.140
What you doing driving into
me, like that, you fucking fool?

27:01.141 --> 27:04.141
Oh, you don't talk? I'm
fuckin' talking to you, bro.

27:05.142 --> 27:07.142
Don't fuckin' look at
me, bro! What the fuck!

28:09.943 --> 28:11.183
What the fuck, man! You crazy?!

28:12.144 --> 28:13.264
What the fuck are you doing?

28:15.145 --> 28:17.145
You know the fuck who I am?

28:19.146 --> 28:26.146
Oh, you're a big man, yeah? I'll be tied up. You cut me
and I'll still be better than you, you fuckin' dickhead.

28:28.147 --> 28:31.147
I'm gonna ask you once.
If I have to ask you twice,

28:32.148 --> 28:34.148
I'm gonna cut off your left
ear. If I have to ask you again,

28:34.149 --> 28:37.149
then I'm gonna cut off your right ear.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.150
Does that make sense? It's a
very, very simple process. Ok?

28:39.151 --> 28:42.151
Are we on the same page? Yes? Good boy. Ok.

28:44.152 --> 28:49.152
The couple in the garage.
Couple of weeks back.

28:50.153 --> 28:55.153
Fuck you, man. Fuck accident. He killed my
little brother. He deserved what we did to him.

28:57.154 --> 28:59.154
Hey. So, what's it mean to you?

29:02.155 --> 29:04.155
I bet you're the son or something, innit.

29:05.156 --> 29:10.156
Your mom... fucked me. Great ass.

29:12.157 --> 29:15.157
We made 'em face each other,
you know. Before we lit 'em up.

29:17.158 --> 29:19.158
So they could watch each other burn.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.159
Should have seen the look on their faces.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.160
Fuckin' priceless.

29:27.161 --> 29:28.161
You know what?

29:31.162 --> 29:32.162
I'm gonna let you go.

29:33.163 --> 29:34.523
But you gotta do something for me.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.164
- You're lying. All of this...
- I'm not lying to you.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.166
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.167
Yes.. I like you.

29:45.168 --> 29:49.168
I need you to give me the names
of the other boys, yeah. Now.

29:51.169 --> 29:57.450
See, take that, take that. Now, listen, listen. Listen.
They're never gonna know, alright, black and white.

29:58.170 --> 30:03.170
You give me the names and
you live, if you don't... well...

30:08.171 --> 30:11.171
Alright, alright.
Alright, I write the list.

30:12.172 --> 30:20.172
What fun did we have? Alright,
fuckin' done. Here, fuckin' take it, man.

30:22.173 --> 30:27.873
But about that stuff I said before,
I took it too far, yeah. My bad.

30:29.174 --> 30:30.174
Yeah.yeah.

30:31.175 --> 30:39.100
But just imagine... just imagine what
it felt like... to be burnt alive.

30:39.176 --> 30:41.176
- What you talking about, man?
- The jolly, lad.

30:41.177 --> 30:42.417
What you fuckin' talkin' about?

30:43.178 --> 30:45.178
You said you'd let me go.

30:46.179 --> 30:50.179
What the fuck you doing... huh...
Please you said you'd gonna let me go.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.180
Let me go, man please!

30:56.181 --> 30:57.181
Please!

30:58.182 --> 31:00.182
I'm sorry, man!

31:01.183 --> 31:02.183
Please! Let me go!

31:03.184 --> 31:04.184
Let me go!

31:05.185 --> 31:06.185
Please!

31:06.186 --> 31:07.186
Please!

31:08.187 --> 31:09.187
Help!

31:14.188 --> 31:15.188
I'm sorry, man!

31:17.189 --> 31:19.189
You said you'd let go!
Somebody help me

31:20.280 --> 31:21.450
let me go man! Please!

32:18.191 --> 32:20.191
You can not sleep, huh are you

32:22.192 --> 32:24.192
the coffee is not gonna not help. Is it?

32:26.193 --> 32:28.193
The sun will be up soon.

32:30.194 --> 32:32.194
How have you been anyway

32:33.195 --> 32:34.195
yeah..

32:37.196 --> 32:42.196
Yeah, real good... the best is
the bigger building. So its fine realy

32:50.197 --> 32:53.197
Jimmy, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

32:56.198 --> 32:59.198
Do you think that was
retaliation for what your dad did

33:06.199 --> 33:09.199
Jimmy, promise me you not do gonna do
anything stupid. Okayeeh?

33:12.200 --> 33:14.200
Can I use your bathroom?

33:16.201 --> 33:18.201
Yes, of course.

33:20.202 --> 33:22.202
Wait a minute. What's that?

33:23.203 --> 33:25.703
- That's just nothing.
- Jesus, Jimmy, you're bleeding!

33:26.204 --> 33:28.204
- Oh, Morgan, just leave it. It's nothing. Noth...
- No, sit down.

33:28.205 --> 33:30.645
- Listen. Just leave it.
- Jimmy, you need a stitch. Sit down.

33:36.206 --> 33:38.206
Tell me what happened, Jimmy?

33:40.207 --> 33:43.207
- Just a couple of guys in a pub, you know.
- In Afghanistan.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.208
Alright, alright...

33:54.209 --> 33:56.209
Something to work while the guy needs talk.

34:00.210 --> 34:02.210
Ah, it's just... it's complicated out here.

34:02.211 --> 34:05.211
Really? Because somebody told me
there's no such thing as a complication.

34:05.400 --> 34:09.212
Only a problem derived
by a person, not a situation.

34:12.213 --> 34:17.213
Who, me? Oh, that makes absolutely no
sense, so... I must have been pissed.

34:18.214 --> 34:19.214
Clown.

34:27.215 --> 34:29.215
I will get around to signing those.

34:33.216 --> 34:35.216
No rush.

34:43.217 --> 34:44.217
Right, eh...

34:48.217 --> 34:50.217
I'm done.

34:52.219 --> 34:56.219
Wait, eh, a little while.
We'll put a dressing on it.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.220
You got it?

35:03.221 --> 35:05.221
It's all better.

35:06.222 --> 35:09.222
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:10.223 --> 35:13.223
Usually cats and dogs, but
it'll do. Hope you like scars.

35:15.224 --> 35:16.224
I'm used to 'em.

35:17.225 --> 35:21.225
How's your little scar.
The day I saved your life.

35:21.826 --> 35:24.226
Please, I was hardly
gonna bleed to death, was I?

35:25.227 --> 35:29.667
Well, that was 20 miles away from the nearest hospital,
in the middle of the???? Anything could have happened.

35:39.228 --> 35:40.228
Oh, well...

35:43.229 --> 35:44.229
Thank you.

36:44.230 --> 36:46.230
- Hey, Morgan.
- She was... halfway through the fun... - Hey.

36:46.231 --> 36:48.231
- What can I get you?
- Ah, cappuccino.

36:51.232 --> 36:57.450
Mr. Evans was last seen yesterday at the peak of
thee in kenwood downs, illegibly at about 9 o'clock.

36:58.233 --> 37:01.233
Big question is how Mr. Evans
came to be out there and why.

37:02.234 --> 37:09.234
Nobody really knows what Mr. Evans was doing out here on his own in a
car. In fact, it's yet to determine whether or not he was actually alone.

37:09.235 --> 37:12.235
- And there we go.
- Thanks

37:13.236 --> 37:18.236
oh that been going on about this all day. Who cares,
right? Its just some dealer is pissed to??????????

37:20.237 --> 37:22.237
And an explosion shortly after.

37:22.238 --> 37:27.238
It seems that this particular area, just up the carmel
road, is quite popular with teen-agers and dealers.

37:27.450 --> 37:29.570
In fact its been a troublesome
spot for some time now

37:30.239 --> 37:35.239
Mr. Evans was arrested 3 years ago after
police caught him in an organized crime gang

37:35.240 --> 37:43.240
raided a flat in Garrison, east London. Mr. Evans admitted being involved in the
supply of cocaine and heroin. His pole?? Keys says a picture of Caleb green, jailed...

37:44.241 --> 37:46.241
How the fuck do you know it's Caleb?

37:46.242 --> 37:50.242
Who else is it gonna be, wraf? You know them 2
spare most of the day argum over percentages.

37:50.450 --> 37:54.330
- Boss was only talking about offing Caleb last week, man.
- Hm. Boy, that's a little tortin, man.

37:56.244 --> 37:58.244
Hey, y'all. Less see
if he the gives it, yeh?

37:59.245 --> 38:00.245
Do this.

38:13.246 --> 38:17.246
- You asking for, fella?
- Want to talk some business.

38:18.247 --> 38:19.247
Now get him man!

38:24.248 --> 38:26.248
- You don't know you're dead, bruff.
- Tell me you did not do it

38:26.249 --> 38:27.249
tell me!

38:28.250 --> 38:30.250
- What you on about?
- You fucking now Warren man!!

38:31.251 --> 38:32.291
I'm reaching for out, braf

38:33.252 --> 38:36.252
I ain't no fucking clue
what you're on about.

38:36.450 --> 38:40.252
Nah... you got one
chance, put that gun down.

38:40.253 --> 38:42.253
And get the fuck off me!

38:43.254 --> 38:45.254
And I'm gonna leave you
fuck guy walk out of here alive.

38:45.255 --> 38:48.255
What ever offense it
was, I aint involved braf

38:52.256 --> 38:53.256
that's not even loaded.

38:54.257 --> 38:55.257
Try me.

38:56.258 --> 38:58.258
Get up. The both of you.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.259
- Someone burned out his car.
- With him in it, braff

39:08.260 --> 39:13.260
and even now it was me... where the fuck I would
have taken the time to do something like that?

39:14.261 --> 39:16.261
Wanna off some prick... put a bullet in him

39:17.262 --> 39:21.262
- before I know it's you, ok?
- I'm what?

39:23.263 --> 39:28.263
You try and do fucko. Now fuck off.
Don't let me see you up in my block again.

39:29.264 --> 39:31.264
Pair of fuckin' cunts

40:44.265 --> 40:45.265
I need some addresses.

40:52.266 --> 40:53.266
Did it feel good?

40:56.267 --> 40:58.267
This far from left.

40:59.268 --> 41:01.268
Jimmy gotta let it go, man.

41:01.269 --> 41:03.234
What? And let you lot sort it.

41:03.269 --> 41:05.269
I have 4 names.
What did you get?

41:09.270 --> 41:12.270
So this is it.
This is how it's gonna be.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.271
I'll just stand back while you go
on some urban safari across London.

41:23.272 --> 41:27.272
Now, you know as well as I do, this is
the only way this is gonna get done.

41:27.273 --> 41:29.273
What happens if you do get one of 'em?

41:31.274 --> 41:33.754
What're you gonna do, take a
statement? You gonna process 'em,

41:34.274 --> 41:39.274
while they laugh at ya, spit in your face. You
try and put them in some cushy little jail,

41:39.275 --> 41:42.275
where they sit on their fuckin'
ass all day, playing video games.

41:43.276 --> 41:48.276
This country's changed.
The riots it just a starving

41:50.277 --> 41:55.277
there was a time I would've bled
to keep the red in the union Jack.

41:57.278 --> 41:59.278
Them days are long gone.

42:00.279 --> 42:03.279
We've got a generation of offenders
we don't know what to do with, griff.

42:04.280 --> 42:07.280
Than you know as well as I do, there's
nothing to stop them doing it again.

42:09.281 --> 42:10.281
There's me.

42:14.282 --> 42:17.282
Revenge will never give you closure.

42:18.283 --> 42:20.283
Revenge?

42:21.284 --> 42:24.284
It's not revenge, this is necessity..

42:27.285 --> 42:29.285
Get me an address.

42:43.286 --> 42:45.286
- How many were there?
- Two.

42:46.287 --> 42:48.727
I know it's really hard, Mrs.
Gilbert, can you describe them?

42:49.288 --> 42:57.288
One had, maybe, a black and white hootie, I
don't remember the others. It happened so fast.

42:59.289 --> 43:00.289
Its okay.

43:02.290 --> 43:04.290
Look, I'll be in a sec, ok?

43:04.291 --> 43:06.291
- Sir?
- Yeah2 hangon a second

43:12.292 --> 43:16.292
Alright, let's get on with it. I'm teeing
off with the superintenant at one o'clock.

43:16.293 --> 43:18.293
And I don't want to be late for this shit.

43:18.294 --> 43:20.334
Armed robbery, two
suspects, both in their forties.

43:21.295 --> 43:24.655
Mr. Oliver tried to grab one of the guns,
apparently. Other guy put two in his chest.

43:25.296 --> 43:28.296
Held Mrs. Guilbert at
gunpoint and raided the till.

43:28.297 --> 43:30.297
Cool. That's a tidy bit of business.

43:31.298 --> 43:34.298
- Eh, any cctv?
- Yeah, but it's a bit dated.

43:35.299 --> 43:37.299
What's he doin' tryin' to
disarm the ne-no-nutter.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.300
I do not know. Protecting his lively hood?

43:41.301 --> 43:43.301
Yeah, that worked out
well for him, didn't it?

43:44.302 --> 43:47.302
- Listen PC... what's your name?
- Griffin.

43:47.303 --> 43:50.783
It's probably just an insurance jump gone
wrong. Try not to take it to personally, mate.

43:51.304 --> 43:54.304
She'll make a claim, get a
huge payout, everyone's happy.

43:54.305 --> 43:55.305
And the suspects?

43:56.306 --> 44:01.346
Eh, get the rounds dug out of Charlie Bronson over there and have
the morgue send 'em over to me. It may take a while, but, eh,

44:01.400 --> 44:05.306
hey ..Slow justice is
better than no justice.

44:22.307 --> 44:24.307
That's enough for me thank you.

44:25.308 --> 44:29.808
- You're drivin', are you?
- No, but I'm a lousy drink

44:30.309 --> 44:32.309
- oh, yeah?
- Hm. Define lousy.

44:33.310 --> 44:34.310
Put it this way

44:34.710 --> 44:39.310
the last time I got drunk, I entered a
wet t-shirt competition on holiday.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.876
- That right? - Hm.
- I won, of course.

44:44.312 --> 44:45.312
Course.

44:47.313 --> 44:49.313
What kind of drunk are you?

44:51.314 --> 44:53.888
I can be quite incorrigible.

44:54.315 --> 44:56.435
Unlike most people, I
embrace the effects of alcohol.

44:58.316 --> 45:00.316
I don't beat myself up
about having a good time.

45:01.317 --> 45:03.317
And this is your
assessment of my character?

45:03.798 --> 45:09.618
No. But I can tell
you're cautious... timid..

45:10.619 --> 45:14.619
And I reckon you're fucking shit-scared
that if you have that glass of wine,

45:15.620 --> 45:20.420
that dress of yours is gonna end up on my
bedroom floor. And your panties in my collection

45:20.621 --> 45:22.621
I'm not wearing any.

45:27.222 --> 45:28.822
Sorry about that guys.

53:12.397 --> 53:14.197
He deserves to die for what he did.

53:15.198 --> 53:17.198

53:18.199 --> 53:19.699

54:14.710 --> 54:18.110
This is a little lesson
in cement.

54:22.111 --> 54:24.711
In general sense a the word
cement is a binder.

54:25.712 --> 54:30.712
It has substance, sets hardened hah
independently.

54:34.312 --> 54:36.712
Binds materials together.

54:45.713 --> 54:47.113
Takes us back to the romans

54:51.114 --> 54:52.714
till they use the term

54:53.115 --> 54:57.115
"opus caementecius"

55:36.116 --> 55:37.416
Wow!

55:37.817 --> 55:38.817
Some kids found him.

55:41.818 --> 55:43.818
Who the blady hell starts something like?

55:47.219 --> 55:48.719
What iis that?

55:49.720 --> 55:51.720
Mouth plumb, I think
that dentists use them.

55:52.321 --> 55:53.921
It seems some kind sex toy.

55:59.222 --> 56:01.622
That's solid.

56:02.623 --> 56:05.623
He may have swallowed that to 2
liters before he eventually suffocated.

56:06.324 --> 56:08.824
The cement is found in all of his
internal organs together.

56:09.325 --> 56:11.825
If you hit now with a
sledgehammer he probaly break apart

56:12.826 --> 56:13.826

56:14.227 --> 56:15.827
The catholigist is on the way.

56:16.828 --> 56:20.228
No, fuck a that
I'm all over this CSI shit

56:21.229 --> 56:24.149
I've been waiting for a decent apolite
ever that since I've been promoted.

56:24.230 --> 56:25.230
Hold that.

56:25.831 --> 56:28.431
You get the kids witness statement
and let lads have some coffees.

to busy sitting up at in a warm office
doing paperwork I suspect,

57:35.245 --> 57:37.845
processing criminals instead of
giving them what they really need

a good kicking - okay

57:51.450 --> 57:53.450

- Protecting my pub.

57:54.251 --> 57:56.851
Your pub? We both know exactly
who you are protecting.

57:57.852 --> 57:59.852
Is it a faire up-on this?

58:01.353 --> 58:04.453
You know exactly who's call that is

58:06.354 --> 58:07.854
They know everything.

58:08.355 --> 58:11.555
They cant win the eye withness slip

58:11.756 --> 58:14.556

You see what they can do!

58:14.957 --> 58:17.357
Yes and I know what Jimmy can do.

58:17.758 --> 58:19.358
He's gonna stain long the lots of them

58:19.859 --> 58:23.359

There.

58:33.162 --> 58:34.662
So what?

58:42.263 --> 58:43.663
Jesus Christ!

58:46.664 --> 58:48.664
Take take take take it
back again to the begining.

58:54.265 --> 58:55.765

58:56.266 --> 58:57.766
Now pause it, there.

59:40.272 --> 59:41.372
Right okay.

59:41.873 --> 59:45.273

59:45.974 --> 59:48.774
- Or talked?
- No, I said I haven't, what is this about?

59:49.475 --> 59:52.475
We may have reason to believe that
her husband is involved in a

59:52.876 --> 59:53.876
series of crimes.

59:54.377 --> 59:56.177
What sort of crimes?

59:56.978 --> 59:58.178
We cant say I'm afraid.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.699
Well if you see him, can you
give us a call as soon as possible

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.380

charge of the investigation.

Morgan, they executed my fucking parents.

01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:47.886
What you're doing exactly the same thing

01:00:48.387 --> 01:00:53.887
They cant deserve justice, they don't deserve
to live they need there hearts torn out.

01:01:08.388 --> 01:01:09.888
They've been there all day.

01:01:18.389 --> 01:01:23.889
Jimmy, when they told me what
happened... I could not believe it.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:30.890
They do that to a old couple...
It's just...

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:41.791
I just wanted to find you.

01:01:52.391 --> 01:01:53.891
What happened?

01:01:57.392 --> 01:02:01.592
Well this six Afghan soldiers we
trained, they betrayed us. Turned on us.

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:08.893
Four Taliban
killed 6 of our soldiers.

01:02:12.494 --> 01:02:14.894
We need to figure out to see
if there were more among us

01:02:15.495 --> 01:02:17.735
so they put me to work on them
and there was this one guy

01:02:19.596 --> 01:02:21.796
now I couldn't talk with him eventualy

01:02:23.797 --> 01:02:25.797
and he knew so much so much

01:02:29.498 --> 01:02:31.798
he would have fucking got us all

01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:34.899
I could not let him live.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.400
I had to hold him keep out

01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:47.401
I went too far...

01:02:50.402 --> 01:02:51.702
And they locked me up.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.803
And you escaped.

01:02:58.204 --> 01:02:59.804
Yeah

01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:10.805
Jimmy.

01:03:15.406 --> 01:03:16.806
Was there ever any one else?

01:03:19.507 --> 01:03:20.807
No!

01:03:43.408 --> 01:03:45.708
This can only end badly.

01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:51.009
And what's the alternitive?

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:57.010
You get in the car and and you
drive untill you don't have any fuel left

01:03:58.211 --> 01:03:59.511
you might have to.

01:04:01.512 --> 01:04:02.712
And would you come with me?

01:04:08.413 --> 01:04:09.713

I think we found your man.

01:06:04.217 --> 01:06:08.417
Under no circumstances are they get to

I'm on my way. Oh get
helicopters.

01:06:10.819 --> 01:06:12.819

Put the gun down, vickers.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.924
Didnt expect to see you colonel.

01:07:20.225 --> 01:07:21.925
Here to take me back?

01:07:25.326 --> 01:07:28.326

01:07:29.327 --> 01:07:31.427
Well, that one is gonna have to wait.

01:07:32.528 --> 01:07:33.828
This not an option James.

01:07:34.429 --> 01:07:36.929
You're a serving soldier in this countrys
most elite force.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:42.430
Brookin knows the Afghan spilled his
guts to you and he wants what you know.

01:07:45.531 --> 01:07:48.051
I got a few things I need to finish first
and than I'll come in.

You're a good lad.. And your a
great soldier.

01:08:02.035 --> 01:08:06.335
But you gotta let this go before it turns
into a mess that even I cant clean up

01:08:08.036 --> 01:08:09.836
I'll stop when the are dead.

01:08:11.437 --> 01:08:12.837
And than I'm out.

01:08:14.538 --> 01:08:15.738
Out?

01:08:16.538 --> 01:08:20.738
I've seen enough blood to last a life time
I want a normal life.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.939
What is a normal life?

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.140
A comfortable desk job
at the ministry?

01:08:27.242 --> 01:08:31.142
Maybe driving a forklift truck
around some grubby warehouse

01:08:32.143 --> 01:08:35.843
newspapers and sandwishes on
your lunch break - have flask of coffee?

01:08:37.344 --> 01:08:39.844
People like you be on the
realm of social integration.

01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:44.245
They sit here you sit there

01:08:46.246 --> 01:08:51.345
psychologically tweaked to be superior
to all these drones that walk the streets

01:08:54.247 --> 01:08:55.647
a lion among lams

01:08:56.648 --> 01:09:01.648
these people if they knew what you have
done to keep them living them mundane lives

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:07.349
they kneel and kiss your feet.

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:12.649
You're a hero, James.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:18.651
You do know if they had not locked me up
I would have been there for them.

01:09:20.652 --> 01:09:23.352
I was due homely the
day before they were killed.

01:09:29.353 --> 01:09:30.653
Pull over.

01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:41.654
You've got 48 hours to clean up
your personal shit.

01:09:42.354 --> 01:09:46.654
Then this turns over to rooker...
And he's not a pussy cat... i'm

01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:12.856
Dickheads!

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:21.857
Joe.

01:10:22.358 --> 01:10:23.458

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:25.126

Yeah, but I have just got to get these tools back to
the armory, so lets get on the move yeh - of course.

01:10:30.361 --> 01:10:32.561
- You know Jimmy vickers, don't ya.

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:36.562
Yeah, I ran a support op for him out
of fort Robinson for four weeks, bro

01:10:37.563 --> 01:10:41.863
is Holland closin' in on 'im?...Well's just
man's trauma now init. I mean, he's gone mad, he?

01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:44.242
You know what they did to his mom and dad.

01:10:44.266 --> 01:10:46.866
Well that don't matter, you
still can't go ranting with a gun.

01:10:47.467 --> 01:10:49.667
But you've got to give me
heads up if hollands find him

01:10:49.868 --> 01:10:53.568
hang on a minute... are you helpin' him?

01:10:54.369 --> 01:10:56.049
Joe, I've known him since I was six, mate.

01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:58.870
I couldn't give a fuck!

01:10:59.271 --> 01:11:00.911
We get the orders to drop him we drop him

01:11:01.472 --> 01:11:02.872
cause he's out of control.

01:11:03.873 --> 01:11:04.873
And Holland isn't?

01:11:05.374 --> 01:11:07.874
He doesn't gives a fuck about anything

01:11:08.475 --> 01:11:11.035
all he wants to do is lead vickers to
show cut his way to the top

01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:14.876
can you imagine a prick
like him as superintendent?

01:11:19.477 --> 01:11:21.877
Just keep me in the loop.
Please.

01:11:30.478 --> 01:11:33.878

I will end you.

01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:09.785
Oh come on, do not be a prick

01:12:10.286 --> 01:12:12.806

01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:29.891

01:12:34.593 --> 01:12:39.593
A zero tolerance on vigilante attacks. Dci

Still priks like you running
around burning people a life

01:15:37.515 --> 01:15:40.215

01:15:41.216 --> 01:15:45.716

01:15:52.218 --> 01:15:53.718
sorry is fuck all!

01:15:54.319 --> 01:15:58.279
Sorry is a cast-away word on the breath of the
hopefuls who have gone too far to right their wrongs.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.420
I'll tell you who I am

01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:04.521

01:16:11.324 --> 01:16:13.824

01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:30.825
Shit!

01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:33.426
What are you doing?

01:17:29.327 --> 01:17:33.827
So you got your plate full...
Some fairly gruesome murders.

01:17:34.328 --> 01:17:36.228
Nothing I can not handle sir,
well get him.

01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:40.229
- You think it's the same person?
- Possibly.

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:43.830
You think that's a safe assessment?

01:17:44.231 --> 01:17:45.231
Without a doubt.

01:17:45.932 --> 01:17:48.832
Why'd you think I became the youngest
chief superintendent in London?

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:51.333
I do not wanna deal with that shits anymore

01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:56.934
you know, in 2003, I went to new
York on holiday with the missus.

01:17:58.335 --> 01:18:02.335
The week we were there, the binmen were
on strike..You cannot imagine the smell.

01:18:02.936 --> 01:18:04.836
To see that size, it was in August, too.

01:18:08.337 --> 01:18:12.837
Listen, people don't really care ore
take notice of the bin men.

01:18:13.338 --> 01:18:15.458
They don't care how they
toss out people's rubbish...

01:18:16.339 --> 01:18:20.339
But if the binmen who stop makes you
know that, the city starts to stink.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.340
Do you understand where
I'm getting to with this?

01:18:26.341 --> 01:18:28.341
I need to know who you are in this story.

01:18:29.342 --> 01:18:32.342
I'm the guy cleaning all the shit up
to make the streets safer.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.343
Well, if you are, you're an idiot.

01:18:38.344 --> 01:18:41.344
The policeman who thinks he can clean
up the streets is a deluded fool.

01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:48.345
You don't rock the boat. You look after number one.
Before you know it, you'll have your own borough.

01:18:49.346 --> 01:18:52.266
- Be nice to be the next superintendent in London, wouldn't it?
- Yes, sir

01:18:53.347 --> 01:18:58.347
you wrap the gruesome ones quick. You grab the statements,
you scrape them off the streets. And you keep the media out.

01:19:01.348 --> 01:19:03.725
If the commissioner finds out about this gettin'
out, it's sure you'll be demoted to constable

01:19:03.749 --> 01:19:07.249
before you can say "Katy price"
is a virgin. Do you understand?

01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:08.950
Yes, sir.

01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:23.751
- Anything else?
- No eh, just a coffee.

01:19:40.752 --> 01:19:43.452
- Can I get you anything sir?
- Have a tea, please.

01:19:43.953 --> 01:19:44.953
Commin right at

01:19:47.354 --> 01:19:50.954
- its blady cold isnt it - yeah

01:19:54.555 --> 01:19:55.955
do we know each other?

01:19:58.456 --> 01:20:00.696
I'm gonna need you to hand
over, anything you got on him

01:20:02.357 --> 01:20:04.717
yeah well, that's not going to
happen will not happen mate.

01:20:05.858 --> 01:20:08.858
You see he belongs to us
us, not you.

01:20:10.859 --> 01:20:15.859
Colonel leach, he does belong to me when he's
taking the law into his own hands in my borough.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.860
Let me explain something to you

01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:34.261
September 2009, we get intel of a major
attack in planned for the British mainland

01:20:35.962 --> 01:20:39.562
on a scale that would make
7/7 but the teddys bear picknic

01:20:40.563 --> 01:20:43.563
we ran an op to bring in the
guy who was planning the attack.

01:20:46.364 --> 01:20:48.764
The Taliban came down on us as piss rain

01:20:49.565 --> 01:20:51.265
the worst fire fight I ever been in

01:20:52.866 --> 01:20:56.766
we could not x-fill with the pricks that
we had to get what we need there and than

01:20:58.367 --> 01:21:02.767
it took vickers 10 minutes alone
with the guy to get him to spil his guts

01:21:04.368 --> 01:21:07.768
while we were fighting of
30 Taliban he gives them everything

01:21:10.369 --> 01:21:12.769
afterwards vickers
execute the prisoner.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:19.770
You see these people
they don't fear death

01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:22.971
they welcome it

01:21:24.572 --> 01:21:25.872
so you must ask yourself

01:21:27.473 --> 01:21:28.873
how did he get the guts

01:21:31.874 --> 01:21:34.674
we were in danger up and run so
we had to go out of there.

01:21:37.275 --> 01:21:38.475
No sign of vickers.

01:21:39.676 --> 01:21:43.676
He turns up 3 days later at bastion
not a scratch on him

01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:46.677
no one knows how he did it.

01:21:49.278 --> 01:21:51.678
If he doesn't wanna be found
he won't be

01:21:53.279 --> 01:21:55.279
he finish up on these guys and than

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.680
he'll vanish

01:22:01.281 --> 01:22:04.881
well, I'll find him
because that's what I do.

01:22:06.482 --> 01:22:11.782
If you lay a finger on my boy,
I will come down on you so hard...

01:22:14.483 --> 01:22:16.783
They'll need paint stripping
to go mob you up

01:22:38.384 --> 01:22:40.784
Commissioner shields I'll presume

01:22:43.285 --> 01:22:44.785
superintendent Walsh.

01:22:45.286 --> 01:22:46.886
- We didn't get your name
- Carter.

01:22:47.387 --> 01:22:48.887
And who would that be a Mr. Carter?

01:22:49.388 --> 01:22:51.028
It would be the a chiefs of staff Carter.

01:23:09.389 --> 01:23:11.889
Thank you for coming at
such short notice gentlemen.

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:17.490
You will forgive us somewhat hasty
pase but we must get in to this matter.

01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:22.611
This man is the subject of
an investigation is he not.

01:23:23.492 --> 01:23:26.392
Jimmy vickers, yes sir. He is suspected
in a series of murders.

01:23:26.993 --> 01:23:30.393
At no point will he be taken
into custody.

01:23:31.394 --> 01:23:32.894
Is that understood?

01:23:33.495 --> 01:23:38.895
Pherhaps we could dispense with a cloake
and dagger this play here and start over

01:23:39.396 --> 01:23:42.796
I am the commissioner shields
London met(Ro) And you are?

01:23:44.397 --> 01:23:49.797

the rest of this exquisite country are safe

every second of every day.

01:23:54.399 --> 01:23:59.799
We are somewhat imbarrashed this invidual slipt
our grasp but I asure you he belongs to us

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.800
your man heading out the investigastion will
report on the hour and you will report to us

01:24:06.401 --> 01:24:07.801

Aeh... just eh.. Trow

may benefit on a certain character profile.

01:24:24.005 --> 01:24:25.005
The csis.

01:24:25.406 --> 01:24:27.906
It is a problem that you don't want on
your streets.

01:24:28.307 --> 01:24:32.607
A problem that only
we can deal with.

01:24:33.608 --> 01:24:36.608
I need him back
where he belongs.

01:28:45.331 --> 01:28:46.831
Nick, give us some room

01:28:56.332 --> 01:29:01.432
Major coincidence is that the last officer to
access to the files of these 2 gentlemen... was you.

01:29:03.433 --> 01:29:05.433
Prior to their deaths, I might add.

01:29:14.434 --> 01:29:17.434
James vickers, a soldierboy.

01:29:20.435 --> 01:29:23.735
Currently serving service in somewhat
shady department of majesty's forces.

01:29:25.436 --> 01:29:29.736
Mid isnt exactly pulling over itself to fill us in
but we understand interragation is his speciality

01:29:30.037 --> 01:29:31.037
and would you believe it?

01:29:32.338 --> 01:29:34.838
They want to know the very
moment we aprehand him

01:29:35.439 --> 01:29:38.839
is he done or are there more

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240
I need to know who's next.

01:29:45.341 --> 01:29:46.841
You do not need to know anything.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:49.982
All you need to do is
stay out of his way.

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.863
I'm not gonna stay at anyones way mate

01:29:52.244 --> 01:29:56.221
Iï¿½m gonna find him and I'm gonna lock him up and do
what's ever hes's after for what's ever they've done

01:29:56.245 --> 01:29:58.845
the last thing he would do is you lock
him up

01:30:00.346 --> 01:30:03.846
he's gonna wipe them out
or die trying

01:30:04.347 --> 01:30:05.947
try dying is good enough for me.

01:30:06.448 --> 01:30:10.008
If he thinks he can go a vigilante on my
streets, he'll gots another thing another comming

01:30:10.449 --> 01:30:12.349
he does not care about you

01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:14.950
he does not care about the law.

01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:20.451
He only wants one thing revenge

01:30:21.452 --> 01:30:24.452
he'll do more justice in a week
what we can do in a year.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.853
We?

01:30:27.354 --> 01:30:32.854
Mr Griffith, I think we can say that you
sees being a police officer the moment

01:30:33.355 --> 01:30:35.075
you started to help your little friend out.

01:30:37.356 --> 01:30:38.856
Well, good luck finding him than

01:30:40.257 --> 01:30:41.857
it may take you a while.

01:30:43.358 --> 01:30:48.858
But, heeh... slow justice is
better than no justice.

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:15.859
"The UK could face
austeritie until 2018."

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.860
Jules, the boarderline's
cats stucked in a tree base

01:31:19.361 --> 01:31:22.561
Alec you got Morrison on the an-eight
chest desk report Marcus on the cheaps side

01:31:23.162 --> 01:31:24.562

01:31:25.362 --> 01:31:29.562
- And what about those murders? Ewh-h I've
hit a wall on that there's nothing on going

01:31:30.263 --> 01:31:33.563
- thought you've a new lead?
'I'm just looking for more substance on it

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:39.464
don't wait to long debbys already sticking the statue
form yeah what ever you sitting on lets have it

01:31:51.465 --> 01:31:55.765
Justice or terrorism?
Vigilante attacks again.

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:02.766
Bitch.

01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:14.967
Superintendent, how are you
this morning?

01:32:15.368 --> 01:32:16.868
Inspecteur, have you seen the papers?

01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:21.769
- What papers that sir don't fuck with

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:25.110
- I want you to report to me on
the hour as from now on -'yes, sir.

01:32:25.371 --> 01:32:29.571

01:34:05.378 --> 01:34:06.778
Alright alright alright

01:34:38.379 --> 01:34:39.779
What's that?

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:45.780
Xaron. It is much more
dangerous in air so for it is a gas.

01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:50.781
Causes spasms, vomiting. Makes
sure your inside full like its on fire

01:34:51.582 --> 01:34:52.782
but this is liquid form.

01:34:53.483 --> 01:34:57.283
And this is what I'm going to put
straight into your veins.

01:34:57.984 --> 01:34:59.784

You had him in the hospital and you

01:37:36.581 --> 01:37:37.881
- Tell him - alright

01:37:39.382 --> 01:37:47.382
I let him go. I let him go because we
knew he lead us to this fucking psychopat

01:37:48.383 --> 01:37:50.883
I did not know he was going to do that

01:37:51.384 --> 01:37:52.884

01:37:58.285 --> 01:37:59.885

01:38:06.387 --> 01:38:10.887
Alpha one to control. The suspect
is fled the scene on foot

01:38:11.388 --> 01:38:15.788

01:38:16.489 --> 01:38:19.789

01:41:30.297 --> 01:41:31.397

01:41:31.497 --> 01:41:33.397
he's invaded the police

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.397
but if he think he can
outsmart his own team

01:41:39.297 --> 01:41:41.397
than he's severly mistaken

01:41:52.297 --> 01:41:57.397
