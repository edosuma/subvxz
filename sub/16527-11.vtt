<i>you</i> weren't charged

03:07.074 --> 03:09.078
with an actual crime.

03:09.078 --> 03:12.084
Because, Dr. Bansal,

03:12.084 --> 03:14.923
you gave testimony two days ago

03:14.923 --> 03:16.660
that made reference

03:16.660 --> 03:18.864
to a reckless
endangerment charge.

03:18.864 --> 03:20.467
Objection.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.672
Dr. Bansal is clearly

03:22.672 --> 03:24.876
too cute to be
guilty of anything.

03:24.876 --> 03:26.078
(chuckles)

03:26.078 --> 03:27.882
You're out of order, Counselor.

03:27.882 --> 03:29.351
This whole court
is out of order!

03:29.351 --> 03:30.688

Overruled.

03:34.696 --> 03:36.967

Dr. Bansal do?

03:36.967 --> 03:37.869
Nothing.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.906
But he's testifying
against my client,

03:39.906 --> 03:42.512
so I'm planning to
invalidate his testimony

03:42.512 --> 03:44.783
by proving he lied
under oath.

03:44.783 --> 03:47.722
And that is why
you should never lie

03:47.722 --> 03:49.526
to your mommy.

03:49.526 --> 03:51.863
So, is your client guilty?

03:51.863 --> 03:53.534
It's not as
simple as that.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.738
Oh, sure it is.
What I get, Roger,

03:55.738 --> 03:58.142

04:00.413 --> 04:01.550
And I love you

10:05.811 --> 10:08.082
Perfect‐game roller.

10:08.082 --> 10:11.288
Notice the plaque with
my name and picture on it.

10:11.288 --> 10:12.891
(chuckles)

10:12.891 --> 10:16.098
I bowled a 300 here.
A perfect game.

10:16.098 --> 10:17.500
That's attractive.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.170
Why would they...?

10:19.170 --> 10:20.774
No, you look good
with a mustache, Rog.

10:20.774 --> 10:23.178
But not a Steve Harvey.
Hey.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.120
I think we found our Leila.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.130
Uh‐huh.
Uh‐huh.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.346
Leila Jones, Detective
Murtaugh and Riggs.

10:40.346 --> 10:42.551
LAPD. We're investigating

10:42.551 --> 10:44.154
the prison‐transport
ambush yesterday.

10:44.154 --> 10:45.222
And we understand
that you had access

10:45.222 --> 10:47.160
to the transport route.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.228
Who else had eyes on that?

10:48.228 --> 10:51.301
I'm not
exactly sure.

10:51.301 --> 10:53.172
Look, I have to go, sorry.

10:53.172 --> 10:55.977
Is this not a good
place for you to talk?

10:57.113 --> 10:59.518
There really isn't
any good place.

10:59.518 --> 11:02.858
MURTAUGH: We're investigating
the murder of a police officer.

11:02.858 --> 11:04.260
You know that, right?

11:04.260 --> 11:06.164
Look, what happened
was awful,

11:06.164 --> 11:08.001
but do you know
what happens when you

11:08.001 --> 11:09.337
talk to the LAPD
about your own?

11:09.337 --> 11:10.941
You get transferred
to night court

11:10.941 --> 11:12.210
or worse.

11:12.210 --> 11:13.312
Worse than night court?

11:13.312 --> 11:17.153
Rumor is, someone in
the department's dog got shot.

11:17.153 --> 11:18.188
Golden retriever.

11:18.188 --> 11:20.560
All because they talked
when they shouldn't have.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.163
This rumor have a name?

11:22.163 --> 11:25.837
'Cause I would love to know
who shot that dog.

11:25.837 --> 11:28.610
MURTAUGH:
Look, we're just trying
to help here, Leila.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.513
We can't do that without a name.

11:33.352 --> 11:35.222
Jeffrey Veld,

11:35.222 --> 11:37.961
same guy who approved
the rangers' transport route.

11:37.961 --> 11:39.965
Look, Sheriff's
is a good group,

11:39.965 --> 11:41.401
but there's always
one bad apple.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.938
Everything
all right here?

11:42.938 --> 11:43.973
Oh, it's wonderful.

11:43.973 --> 11:46.144
We just can't get enough
of that rented‐shoe smell.

11:46.144 --> 11:47.213
(sniffs)
Smells like
foot and ass.

11:47.213 --> 11:48.382
Oh, it's so nice.

11:48.382 --> 11:50.252
MAN:
Roger Murtaugh,
in the flesh.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.288
Oh, I recognize you

11:51.288 --> 11:52.624
from your picture on the wall.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.227
Did you now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.227 --> 11:55.162
Dude, you got
to tell me, man,

11:55.162 --> 11:57.099
how'd you get them
to put that up there?

11:57.099 --> 11:58.503
I bowled a 300.

11:58.503 --> 11:59.505
That's how.

11:59.505 --> 12:01.308
Right, yeah.

12:01.308 --> 12:03.378
The perfect game during
which the electric score keeper

12:03.378 --> 12:05.249
just so happened
to go out in the middle.

12:05.249 --> 12:07.386
Ooh! What are the odds?

12:07.386 --> 12:10.259
Are you suggesting that
I didn't bowl a perfect game?

12:10.259 --> 12:11.261
Just admit it, Murtaugh.

12:11.261 --> 12:12.296
Your score is bogus.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.601
And now I think he's
questioning my integrity.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.204
That's exactly
what he's doing.
That's what
I think that is.

12:16.204 --> 12:17.941
And here's the thing with that,
you can question

12:17.941 --> 12:19.611
my integrity all day long,
but this man

12:19.611 --> 12:20.714
is just full
of integrity.

12:20.714 --> 12:23.485
Mm, I'm questioning
his integrity and your skill.

12:23.485 --> 12:25.489
Deputy, could I show you
a little bit of skill?

12:25.489 --> 12:26.491
All right, oh,
hold on, hold on.

12:26.491 --> 12:28.362
So, just so
that I'm clear,

12:28.362 --> 12:29.965
are we about to get into
a fight in this bowling alley?

12:29.965 --> 12:31.502
I think so.
Okay, I just
wanted to make sure.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.303
I mean, it's awesome
if we are.

12:32.303 --> 12:34.641
MAN 2:
Detective Roger Murtaugh?

12:34.641 --> 12:36.111
Hey, Luke Barton.

12:36.111 --> 12:37.981
It's nice to meet you

12:37.981 --> 12:38.983
and thank you,

12:38.983 --> 12:40.119
both of you, for coming down

12:40.119 --> 12:41.121
to our annual fund‐raiser.

12:41.121 --> 12:42.991
Always nice
to feel supported

12:42.991 --> 12:44.327
by our friends
in the LAPD.

12:44.327 --> 12:46.331
That is why you're here,
isn't it?

12:46.331 --> 12:49.470
We're investigating the murder
of a Texas Ranger.

12:49.470 --> 12:51.675
You boys heard about that,
right, out in the desert?

12:51.675 --> 12:54.280
Yeah, it's horrible
what happened.

12:55.282 --> 12:56.351
Well... if you guys

12:56.351 --> 12:58.288
need anything,
just let me know.

12:58.288 --> 12:59.157
You have
the sheriff department's

12:59.157 --> 13:00.159
full support on this.

13:00.159 --> 13:02.229
Mm, appreciate that.

13:02.229 --> 13:03.298
Remember, Murtaugh,

13:03.298 --> 13:04.167
we're all cops here.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.904
We're rooting for you
on this case,

13:05.904 --> 13:08.241
so try not to take the outcome
like you did

13:08.241 --> 13:10.012
your perfect game.

13:10.012 --> 13:11.281
(groans)
All right.

13:11.281 --> 13:14.020
I'm‐a give you three seconds
to take that back

13:14.020 --> 13:15.289
and apologize.

13:15.289 --> 13:17.126
So start counting.
One...

13:17.126 --> 13:18.195
RIGGS:
Okay, here's the thing,

13:18.195 --> 13:19.330
if we're gonna get into
a fight with police officers

13:19.330 --> 13:20.466
in a bowling alley...

13:20.466 --> 13:21.669
... two...
... then there's
one thing

13:21.669 --> 13:23.271
you've got to know.

13:23.271 --> 13:24.675
Hit first.

13:24.675 --> 13:26.879
(men yelling)

13:29.685 --> 13:31.421
MAN:
<i>Well, I am glad to hear</i>

13:31.421 --> 13:33.291
that you are doing well
over there, Avery.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.498
Today captain,
tomorrow who knows, right?

13:36.498 --> 13:39.036
So far so good,
and likewise.

13:39.036 --> 13:40.607
I'm glad things are good
for you at Sheriff's.

13:40.607 --> 13:42.309
Mm, yes, they are.

13:42.309 --> 13:43.980
12 years running now.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.384
You know, what
happened out there

13:46.384 --> 13:49.323
in the desert
with that ranger...

13:49.323 --> 13:51.729
real tragedy.

13:51.729 --> 13:52.664
It was.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.535
Some of your detectives
have been sniffing

13:54.535 --> 13:55.603
around my department.

13:55.603 --> 13:58.475
I heard they had a run‐in
with some of my boys‐‐

13:58.475 --> 14:00.613
off duty, no less.

14:00.613 --> 14:03.285
Just doing our jobs...

14:03.285 --> 14:06.024
looking into every avenue
of investigation.

14:07.459 --> 14:11.034
I'm gonna be real clear here,
Avery.

14:11.034 --> 14:14.708
If there's a problem in my
house, I will handle it myself.

14:14.708 --> 14:17.112
Of course I would extend
the same courtesy to you

14:17.112 --> 14:19.450
if the roles were
reversed, you know that.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.054
Right?

14:21.054 --> 14:22.122
So, please,

14:22.122 --> 14:24.126
for both our sakes...

14:24.126 --> 14:26.599
tighten the leash on your boys,
all right?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.468
I will, I will talk to them,
sure...

14:28.468 --> 14:29.738
Thank you.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.744
... but I have a dead
Texas Ranger on my board

14:32.744 --> 14:35.482
and I can't tell them
where not to look.

14:35.482 --> 14:37.486
(laughs)

14:37.486 --> 14:39.156
Yeah, I understand.

14:39.156 --> 14:40.359
(chuckles)

14:40.359 --> 14:41.795
You know, cops...

14:41.795 --> 14:43.498
good cops...

14:43.498 --> 14:45.168
you know, they
make mistakes...

14:45.168 --> 14:48.776
and those mistakes don't
ever really go away.

14:48.776 --> 14:52.149
They have consequences...

14:52.149 --> 14:53.151
and I'd really hate

14:53.151 --> 14:55.389
for this investigation
to drudge up anything

14:55.389 --> 14:57.594
that you wouldn't
want to surface.

14:57.594 --> 15:01.367
Best to let the past stay...

15:01.367 --> 15:03.071
locked up.

15:03.071 --> 15:05.142
Don't you think?

15:06.344 --> 15:08.214
Get your men under control.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.358
MURTAUGH:
<i>For what it's worth,</i>

15:13.358 --> 15:14.561
the brawl was my fault

15:14.561 --> 15:16.030
and Riggs was
just backing me up.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.567
No, I threw
the first punch.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.036
I mean, I've got a reputation
to uphold.

15:19.036 --> 15:21.107
They were questioning
my integrity

15:21.107 --> 15:22.176
as a police officer.
And as a bowler.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.246
As a bowler.
And those sheriffs
are real dicks.

15:24.246 --> 15:26.184
I mean, to be fair,
and possibly murderers,

15:26.184 --> 15:28.054
am I right?
I'm starting
to warm up to that theory.

15:28.054 --> 15:30.392
Did you guys
find anything specific

15:30.392 --> 15:31.795
that links the
sheriff department

15:31.795 --> 15:32.797
to the ranger's murder?

15:32.797 --> 15:34.467
Yeah, the, uh, transfer clerk

15:34.467 --> 15:37.272
at the prison
just gave us a name.

15:37.272 --> 15:38.809
Deputy Jeffrey Veld.

15:38.809 --> 15:41.080
Apparently he approved
the transfer route

15:41.080 --> 15:42.216
the night before the murder.

15:42.216 --> 15:43.084
And she said that

15:43.084 --> 15:46.157
Veld recently shot
a co‐worker's dog.

15:46.157 --> 15:47.092
A dog? Why?

15:47.092 --> 15:47.994
MURTAUGH:
The way she put it,

15:47.994 --> 15:50.499
for talking
when they shouldn't have.

15:50.499 --> 15:51.502
Talking about what?

15:51.502 --> 15:52.504
We don't know.

15:52.504 --> 15:53.506
She was trying
to tell us, and then

15:53.506 --> 15:56.578
a certain Deputy Barton
came up and spooked her,

15:56.578 --> 15:57.446
and that's when the other deputy

15:57.446 --> 15:59.618
got in Roger's face.
Before you know it,

15:59.618 --> 16:01.320
it was on.
(chuckles)

16:01.320 --> 16:02.423
If by "on"

16:02.423 --> 16:03.526
you mean moronic.

16:03.526 --> 16:04.594
If by "moronic" you mean

16:04.594 --> 16:06.832
a hell of a lot of fun,
then yeah.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.536
So, that's all we have
on them right now

16:08.536 --> 16:10.673
is this... this dog thing?

16:10.673 --> 16:12.677
Yeah. We had the dog exhumed.

16:12.677 --> 16:14.480
Yeah, Scorsese's doing

16:14.480 --> 16:15.550
an autopsy now.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.554
Yeah, hey,

16:17.554 --> 16:19.558
Chief, I know,
it's very disturbing,

16:19.558 --> 16:21.695
the whole dog thing.

16:21.695 --> 16:23.231
No, it's a legitimate lead.

16:23.231 --> 16:25.302
I want you to keep pressing,
but, guys, listen to me.

16:25.302 --> 16:26.437
We have to be...

16:26.437 --> 16:27.439
Delicate.

16:27.439 --> 16:28.509
...delicate

16:28.509 --> 16:30.111
and persistent.

16:30.111 --> 16:31.582
Nobody gets a free pass on this.

16:31.582 --> 16:32.851
Right.
Yeah.

16:32.851 --> 16:34.588
(sighs)

16:42.904 --> 16:45.342
Well?
Did he rip you a new one?

16:45.342 --> 16:47.145
Avery?
Surprisingly, no.

16:47.145 --> 16:48.883
Pays to be a
first‐time offender.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.753
So, we have anything
on Veld yet?

16:50.753 --> 16:51.722
Sheriff's Deputy Veld‐‐

16:51.722 --> 16:54.360
um, Internal Affairs
investigated him twice

16:54.360 --> 16:55.630
for excessive force.

16:55.630 --> 16:57.634
Not surprising,
considering he put

16:57.634 --> 16:58.669
a dog in the grave.

16:58.669 --> 16:59.671
SCORSESE:
Yeah,

16:59.671 --> 17:00.673
about that.

17:00.673 --> 17:01.608
You okay?

17:01.608 --> 17:02.677
You don't look so good.

17:02.677 --> 17:04.848
Maybe that's because
I just cut open the remains

17:04.848 --> 17:07.720
of a golden retriever
named Thunder.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.858
Scorsese, you do it
to humans all day long.

17:09.858 --> 17:11.662
Yeah, but humans
are my comfort zone.

17:11.662 --> 17:13.666
Dogs... not so much.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.670
Anyway, the bullet
that felled Thunder

17:15.670 --> 17:17.740
was the same caliber
that killed the ranger,

17:17.740 --> 17:19.878
fired by the same
Mini‐14 assault rifle.

17:19.878 --> 17:22.750
Standard issue at Sheriff's
until... two years ago.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.690
Time to get Thunder
some justice.

17:31.902 --> 17:33.706
(chuckles)
Trish.

17:33.706 --> 17:35.643
Thank you.
Thank you...

17:35.643 --> 17:37.312
for meeting me
on such short notice.

17:37.312 --> 17:38.582
Of course.

17:38.582 --> 17:40.586
You didn't
sound so good.

17:40.586 --> 17:41.588
Well, here we are

17:41.588 --> 17:42.924
in the middle of a work day,

17:42.924 --> 17:44.661
eight blocks from your office.

17:44.661 --> 17:45.796
If I didn't know better,

17:45.796 --> 17:47.800
I'd say you think
you need a lawyer.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.338
I think I do...

17:50.338 --> 17:51.608
one I can trust.

17:51.608 --> 17:53.812
Well, you got her...

17:53.812 --> 17:55.348
but I have to ask,

17:55.348 --> 17:57.419
does this have anything
to do with Roger?

17:57.419 --> 17:58.121
Because...

17:58.121 --> 18:00.559
if it does,
you know I can't

back when we were partners.

22:02.510 --> 22:03.912
...there was this guy,
Peter Scarelli,

22:03.912 --> 22:06.183
raped and killed
a ten‐year‐old girl.

22:06.183 --> 22:08.989
We had DNA evidence, but then,

22:08.989 --> 22:09.957
right before trial,

22:09.957 --> 22:12.530
the DNA sample got compromised
in the lab,

22:12.530 --> 22:14.466
so it was inadmissible.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.802
He was gonna walk.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.542
I knew this guy at the
sheriff's department,

David Reed‐‐ runs things
over there now‐‐ anyway,

22:21.948 --> 22:24.219
David got me access

22:24.219 --> 22:25.822
when he was in the yard.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.093
Didn't take long to find
what I was looking for.

22:28.093 --> 22:29.830
What was that?

22:29.830 --> 22:31.901
A strand of Scarelli's hair

22:31.901 --> 22:34.105
that found its way
to the victim's sweater.

22:34.105 --> 22:35.842
Second time around,

22:35.842 --> 22:38.247
the DNA sample was
not compromised.

22:38.247 --> 22:40.852
And Scarelli went away for life.

22:43.925 --> 22:45.929
I framed a man for murder,
Riggs.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.133

22:49.537 --> 22:50.872

22:50.872 --> 22:52.543
So, what?

22:54.680 --> 22:55.949

23:10.912 --> 23:12.516

23:41.106 --> 23:44.312
Hey, how'd it go
in there, buddy?

23:44.312 --> 23:46.049
Did you tell them all
how heroic I am,

23:46.049 --> 23:48.588
saving you
and your partner's life?

23:48.588 --> 23:50.191
Yeah, that's exactly
what I told them.

23:50.191 --> 23:52.730
It didn't cross my mind
to tell them that I think Davies

23:52.730 --> 23:54.934
paid you to break him out,
and then you killed him

23:54.934 --> 23:56.604
when you thought
we were too close.

23:56.604 --> 23:58.340
Do I look worried?

23:58.340 --> 24:00.144
You look guilty.

24:00.144 --> 24:01.346
Well, in that case, I might need

24:01.346 --> 24:03.283
to get myself
a good lawyer, huh?

24:03.283 --> 24:04.887
Hey, you think you can get me

24:04.887 --> 24:06.022
a sit‐down with your wife?

24:06.022 --> 24:07.626
I heard she's very expensive

24:07.626 --> 24:09.028
by the hour, but worth it.

24:10.164 --> 24:11.634
(chuckles)

24:12.636 --> 24:13.772
What's so funny?

24:13.772 --> 24:16.644
I can't help but thinking about

24:16.644 --> 24:19.048
how a former sheriff's deputy

24:19.048 --> 24:20.719
is gonna fare in prison.

24:20.719 --> 24:23.123
What kind of bonds
you're gonna have

24:23.123 --> 24:25.060
with your fellow inmates.

24:26.129 --> 24:28.000
You'll let me know.

24:31.974 --> 24:34.112
Technically, what he
said wasn't a threat.
Wait,

24:34.112 --> 24:35.381
are you his attorney?

24:35.381 --> 24:37.285
I don't care how you parse it,

24:37.285 --> 24:39.088
he invoked your name
and that's not okay.

24:39.088 --> 24:41.694
I'm just saying...
No, no, no, stop it.

24:41.694 --> 24:43.130
You're fearless, I get it.

24:43.130 --> 24:44.299
I love it.

24:44.299 --> 24:45.167
I'm attracted to it.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.639
But these guys just aren't
corrupt cops,

24:47.639 --> 24:49.242
they're killers.
And you

24:49.242 --> 24:50.377
will catch them.

24:50.377 --> 24:53.050
I'm not worried, Roger.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.587
Okay?

24:56.423 --> 24:57.926
(knocking at door)

24:57.926 --> 24:59.597

25:03.872 --> 25:04.807
Hi, Roger.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.878
Hmm. I would have thought
it'd be Riggs.

25:06.878 --> 25:08.146
He usually spoils
my evenings.

25:08.146 --> 25:10.619
We need to talk.

25:10.619 --> 25:11.954
Let's go to my office.

25:11.954 --> 25:14.225
Roger and I
need to talk.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.029
As your lawyer,

25:16.029 --> 25:17.966
I would strongly advise
you against that.

25:17.966 --> 25:19.168
As your lawyer?

25:19.168 --> 25:20.639
You hired my wife?

25:20.639 --> 25:22.643
Remember Peter Scarelli?

25:24.647 --> 25:25.982
You framed a guy for murder.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.320
She was ten years old, Roger.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.990
He had to go away.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.259
I don't disagree.

25:31.259 --> 25:33.798
But by framing him? I would have

25:33.798 --> 25:35.200
turned your ass in.
I know.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.071
And then Scarelli
would have walked.
No.

25:37.071 --> 25:39.810
I would have found another way
to get him, legally!

25:39.810 --> 25:41.681
How many others
were there?

25:41.681 --> 25:42.549
How many times

25:42.549 --> 25:44.820
did you break the law
to enforce it?

25:44.820 --> 25:46.423
He was the only one.

25:46.423 --> 25:48.026
Oh, he was
the only one?

25:48.026 --> 25:49.429
How noble.

25:49.429 --> 25:52.034
And you're only
telling me this now, why?

25:52.034 --> 25:54.707
Because you just
got blackmailed?

25:55.441 --> 25:57.445
I'm gonna resign, Roger.

25:57.445 --> 26:00.117
Damn.

26:00.117 --> 26:02.021
That actually is noble.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.927
And if you think this is
the time when I'm gonna say,

26:04.927 --> 26:06.162
"Hey, don't do it, man,

26:06.162 --> 26:08.768
it's not worth it,"

26:08.768 --> 26:10.170
you're wrong.

26:10.170 --> 26:12.676
I'm not asking for that.

26:12.676 --> 26:14.412
And I'm not asking you
to forgive me.

26:14.412 --> 26:16.617
And I appreciate that.

26:18.020 --> 26:19.088
I can't.

26:37.058 --> 26:40.130
Any reason you're waiting
outside my house?

26:40.130 --> 26:43.871
Well, there was a string
of burglaries in the area,

26:43.871 --> 26:46.476
and I just wanted to
make sure that, you know,

26:46.476 --> 26:48.080
you and your family were safe.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.484
Aren't you
the perfect gentleman?

26:50.484 --> 26:51.286
Well,

26:51.286 --> 26:53.156
just returning the favor,
really.

26:53.156 --> 26:54.492
You know, after you
showed an interest

26:54.492 --> 26:56.096

You know, hey,

26:56.096 --> 26:57.364
his wife,

26:57.364 --> 26:59.235
in particular, I understand.

26:59.235 --> 27:02.909
Boy, you LAPD guys
are so sensitive.

27:04.780 --> 27:07.051
Not so surprising
coming from Murtaugh,

27:07.051 --> 27:08.086
but from what
I understand,

27:08.086 --> 27:09.857
you've got a thicker skin,
you're not such a‐‐

27:09.857 --> 27:13.130
a team player over there.
Isn't that right?

27:13.130 --> 27:16.269
Well, thing is...

27:16.269 --> 27:18.273
the Murtaughs are my team.

27:18.273 --> 27:20.077
Like your foster family?

27:21.212 --> 27:23.150
'Cause you don't have one
of your own?

27:23.150 --> 27:23.985
Isn't that right?

27:23.985 --> 27:26.356
Now you're just trying
to charm me.

27:26.356 --> 27:30.297
Look at you, camped
outside of my house, doing this,

27:30.297 --> 27:31.901
trying to scare
me a little.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.504
You know, if I
think about it,

27:33.504 --> 27:36.176
I'd say that you and I,

27:36.176 --> 27:37.278
we're not that different.

27:37.278 --> 27:40.250
Well, you know, there is
one thing that's different.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.121
I ain't ever killed a cop.
(clicks tongue)

27:42.121 --> 27:43.123
Right?
(chuckles)

27:43.123 --> 27:45.127
There's a difference.

27:45.127 --> 27:46.329
(engine starts)

27:46.329 --> 27:48.534
Well...

27:48.534 --> 27:50.805
not yet, anyway.

27:58.554 --> 27:59.422
You really thought

27:59.422 --> 28:01.827
it was a good idea
to represent him‐‐

28:01.827 --> 28:04.498
my former partner,
current captain.

28:04.498 --> 28:05.835
Good morning, honey.

28:05.835 --> 28:07.104
And yes, I did.

28:07.104 --> 28:08.373
He's your friend, too,

28:08.373 --> 28:09.509
and he needs my help.

28:09.509 --> 28:11.513
What he needs is
a different lawyer.

28:11.513 --> 28:13.250
And considering his crime,

28:13.250 --> 28:14.385
the shadier, the better.

28:14.385 --> 28:15.521
So you never had
to bend the rules?

28:15.521 --> 28:16.523
Bend the rules, yeah.

28:16.523 --> 28:18.193
Frame a man? Not even close.

28:18.193 --> 28:19.328
Scarelli?

28:19.328 --> 28:21.867
Scarelli was a ruthless killer.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.005
Who knows how many lives‐‐
children's lives‐‐

28:24.005 --> 28:25.340
Avery saved by
doing what he did.

28:25.340 --> 28:26.342
By cheating the system.

28:26.342 --> 28:27.278
Oh, come on, Roger.

28:27.278 --> 28:29.950
We both know the system
is far from perfect.

28:29.950 --> 28:32.221
Now, you are hurting
because it's Avery.

28:32.221 --> 28:33.290
It's principle.

28:33.290 --> 28:34.091
Principle?
Yes.

28:34.091 --> 28:35.962
What did you say
the other morning?

28:35.962 --> 28:37.164
Huh? "At the end of the day,

28:37.164 --> 28:39.235
either you did it,
or you didn't do it."

28:39.235 --> 28:41.372
Scarelli did it.

28:41.372 --> 28:42.976
And he's not even
in prison anymore.

28:42.976 --> 28:43.844
I checked.

28:43.844 --> 28:45.247
Out on compassionate leave.

28:45.247 --> 28:47.251
End‐stage liver disease.

28:47.251 --> 28:49.121
So...
So? So what?

28:49.121 --> 28:51.225
At the end of the day, Trish,

28:51.225 --> 28:52.361
Avery did it, too.

28:52.361 --> 28:53.229
We have enough cops

28:53.229 --> 28:55.334
out there not playing
by the rules.

28:57.371 --> 28:58.541
(sighs)

29:07.358 --> 29:10.030
(whistling)

29:16.242 --> 29:21.854
I'd like to report a break‐in
over on 28 Lynwood Place.

29:21.854 --> 29:23.256
Yeah, hope you're here
in a hurry.

29:47.972 --> 29:50.978
(siren approaching)

29:54.251 --> 29:56.122
(sirens blaring)

29:59.930 --> 30:03.537
MURTAUGH:
<i>These came from Barton's house?</i>

30:03.537 --> 30:07.077
That's the wrong question
to be asking right now, Rog.

30:07.077 --> 30:09.081
The correct question would be:
are those the rounds

30:09.081 --> 30:10.283
that killed our ranger?

30:10.283 --> 30:12.154
No. We're not doing it this way.

30:12.154 --> 30:13.089
Okay,

30:13.089 --> 30:14.960
how about I return them

30:14.960 --> 30:16.964
after we make the arrest?

30:16.964 --> 30:18.166
What, you don't think
I want this guy, too?

30:18.166 --> 30:19.301
He killed one of our own.

30:19.301 --> 30:21.339
But it means nothing
unless we can prove

30:21.339 --> 30:24.245
that Barton was in possession
of the murder weapon.

30:24.245 --> 30:25.347
Now we can.

30:25.347 --> 30:26.482
I checked the bar code.

30:26.482 --> 30:29.723
That box of ammo was purchased
at the Temecula Gun Show

30:29.723 --> 30:30.758
about two months ago,

30:30.758 --> 30:32.361
along with four Mini‐14

30:32.361 --> 30:33.496
assault rifles.

30:33.496 --> 30:34.666
Guess who made the purchase.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.469
BOTH:
Luke Barton.

30:36.469 --> 30:37.539
No.

30:37.539 --> 30:38.541
The L. A. Sheriff's Boy's Home.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.343
Assault weapons for a charity?

30:40.343 --> 30:42.281
Right, except for
it wasn't an official

30:42.281 --> 30:43.784
department charity,
it was a personal charity,

30:43.784 --> 30:45.387
founded by your boy.

30:45.387 --> 30:46.489
Luke Barton.

30:46.489 --> 30:47.491
Let me guess,

30:47.491 --> 30:49.295
a large contribution was made
to this charity

30:49.295 --> 30:50.698
right before
Wade Davies' release?

30:50.698 --> 30:52.635
More proof that
Davies hired Barton

30:52.635 --> 30:54.171
to bust him out of custody.

30:54.171 --> 30:55.440
All right, let's tell Avery.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.442
Okay,

30:56.442 --> 30:58.046
now we get a warrant.

30:58.046 --> 30:59.448
We make a legitimate arrest.

30:59.448 --> 31:00.785
We do this by the book.

31:00.785 --> 31:02.054
You're such a stickler.

31:02.054 --> 31:03.389
Hey, Cap?

31:06.095 --> 31:07.532
Anyone seen the captain?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.335
He hasn't been here all day.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.538
All day?

31:10.538 --> 31:12.007
Mm‐mm‐mm.

31:12.007 --> 31:13.744
You think Barton's got something
to do with this?

31:13.744 --> 31:16.349
Straight to voice mail.

31:16.349 --> 31:17.317
Bailey,

31:17.317 --> 31:19.221
need you to get a
location on the captain

31:19.221 --> 31:20.357
ASAP.

31:20.357 --> 31:23.229
I'm on it, just give me
a few minutes.

31:32.114 --> 31:35.120
Looks like you
started without me.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.790
Yeah, well.
(sighs)

31:36.790 --> 31:38.192
Why not, right?

31:38.192 --> 31:41.465
You know, it seems my request
to back off

31:41.465 --> 31:43.136
fell on deaf ears.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.475
I tried to steer my guy away.

31:46.475 --> 31:48.413
But your man, Barton,
didn't exactly

31:48.413 --> 31:50.216
cover his tracks
very well.

31:55.493 --> 31:59.234
You were really okay with him
killing the ranger?

32:00.303 --> 32:01.840
No.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.777
But it's not like he asked.

32:03.777 --> 32:05.514
You know, he's got this thing

32:05.514 --> 32:07.117
for frontier justice.

32:07.117 --> 32:10.791
But Veld takes the fall for this
and no one is the wiser.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.394
He killed a cop.

32:12.394 --> 32:14.465
How can you
live with that?

32:14.465 --> 32:15.467
Look,

32:15.467 --> 32:18.473
at this point,
Barton is off the reservation.

32:18.473 --> 32:22.481
We both have guys under our
command like that now, don't we?

32:22.481 --> 32:23.517
Guys who like to color

32:23.517 --> 32:27.090
outside the line,
but who can be very useful.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.426
You can try to put
a short leash on them,

32:28.426 --> 32:30.096
but at the end of the day
you can't always

32:30.096 --> 32:31.833
control what happens.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.506
(clicks tongue and gulps)

32:34.506 --> 32:36.843
It makes me sick.

32:36.843 --> 32:38.714
Scotch helps.

And so should the knowledge

32:40.183 --> 32:42.320
that your career
can continue.

40:41.344 --> 40:43.215
So you really think you can bowl
another perfect game?

40:43.215 --> 40:44.752
Bailey...
I'm just saying
that seems a bit...

40:47.022 --> 40:48.158
We just wanted to say

40:48.158 --> 40:49.762
you did right
by putting Barton

40:49.762 --> 40:51.030
and his guys away.

40:51.030 --> 40:52.032
They made the whole department

there's a man or woman here
that believes

40:55.239 --> 40:56.842

Good.

you're not gonna get that.

'Cause he will.

Come on, honey.

Look, this is fun.

W‐What does that mean?

And most importantly,

42:12.994 --> 42:13.996
you do it for me.

42:13.996 --> 42:16.334
Because I don't have
the $2,000 to cover the bet.
