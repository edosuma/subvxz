[Lisa grunts]

00:45.462 --> 00:47.381
[gasps]

00:47.464 --> 00:49.091
Ohh.

00:55.097 --> 00:58.267
[mechanism clanking]

00:58.350 --> 00:59.893
[energy surges]

01:02.145 --> 01:03.146

01:16.910 --> 01:19.538
[hinges creak]

01:37.180 --> 01:38.807
[door clangs shut]

01:45.522 --> 01:47.065
My name is Lisa.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.900
I am from the Village of Lupu.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.819
I want to be a doctor.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.574
You bang on my front door

01:55.657 --> 01:58.744
because you want to daub
chicken blood on peasants.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.246
Don't mistake me for a witch.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.540
Everybody out there already does that.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.042
I believe in science, but...

02:05.125 --> 02:06.460
[cape flutters]

02:06.543 --> 02:08.170
I need to know more.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.505
I've exhausted my other options,

02:10.589 --> 02:13.383
and all the stories say
the man who lives here

02:13.467 --> 02:15.469
has secret knowledge.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.763
I am Vlad Dracula Tepes,

02:17.846 --> 02:21.308
and I do not get many visitors.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.934
What have you to trade

02:23.018 --> 02:24.645
for my knowledge,

02:24.728 --> 02:26.229
Lisa from Lupu?

02:29.358 --> 02:31.943
Perhaps I could help you
relearn some manners.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.404
I've crossed the threshold of your home,

02:34.488 --> 02:37.658
and you haven't offered me a drink
or even to take my coat.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.993
What if I took a drink from you?

02:40.077 --> 02:44.581
Or have you loaded yourself
with silver, crosses,

02:44.665 --> 02:47.793
and garlic in superstitious fear?

02:47.876 --> 02:51.088
I might have eaten
some roasted garlic earlier.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.799
Was that rude?
I-it was all I had left.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.009
I'm really not interested in superstition,

02:56.093 --> 02:57.719
or being some muttering wise woman

02:57.803 --> 03:00.138
cheating people
with boiled nettles and entrails.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.516
I want to heal people.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.850
I want to learn.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.852
Will you help me?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.063
You are definitely different

03:08.146 --> 03:11.358
to most humans
I have met in recent times.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.111
Maybe I can teach you
to like people again,

03:14.194 --> 03:16.279
or at least tolerate them,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.949
or stop putting them on sticks.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.450
[Dracula chuckles]

03:20.534 --> 03:23.662
I gave that up a long time ago.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.415
Where is Lupu Village?

03:26.998 --> 03:28.333
You don't travel much.

03:28.417 --> 03:33.130
I can travel. This entire structure
is a traveling machine.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.757
But... you don't.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.092
Do you?

03:37.175 --> 03:40.429
Maybe you should.
The world is changing.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.348
Travel, like people do.
You might like it.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.685
I've known you two minutes,

03:46.768 --> 03:50.689
and you offer for me to walk the earth
like an ordinary peasant

03:50.772 --> 03:53.442
while I give you
the knowledge of immortals,

03:53.525 --> 03:55.736
the true science.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.240
[Lisa gasps] Ohh.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.993
[gasps]

04:03.076 --> 04:04.411
[fluids gurgling]

04:04.494 --> 04:05.829
[soft gasp]

04:05.912 --> 04:07.247
[mechanisms whirr]

04:07.831 --> 04:09.166
My.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.252
They won't be peasants anymore
if you teach them.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.423
They won't live such short, scared lives
if they have real medicine.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.718
They won't be superstitious
if they learn how the world really works.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.803
[chuckling]
Why should I do that?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.722
To make the world better.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.601
Start with me,
and I'll start with you.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.190
I think I might like you.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.711
[distant voices murmuring]

04:59.633 --> 05:01.551
[Lisa groans]

05:03.553 --> 05:04.554
[pained gasp]

05:04.638 --> 05:07.390
[no audible dialogue]

05:07.599 --> 05:10.519
[no audible dialogue]

05:14.523 --> 05:17.859
So there were devil engines
in her house, Bishop?

05:17.943 --> 05:20.570
I saw them with my own eyes.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.158
And glass in shapes
you've never seen, thin as paper.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.868
Lightning.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.496
Strange weeds and tools.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.540
Witch's things.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.876
Of all the witches I've rooted out,

05:34.960 --> 05:37.420
none had such a collection.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.756
And it had to come to this?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.842
She called it all science, Mayor.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.137
Lisa Tepes of Lupu was so far gone

05:46.221 --> 05:50.100
that she just couldn't see that
it was all given to her by Satan.

05:50.850 --> 05:55.355
I've made some small study of
the chemical sciences myself, you know.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.401
[stammering]
J-just a study, of course.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.696
I-I'd never think to practice such things.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.699
The Archbishop would prefer
that life in Wallachia

06:05.782 --> 06:08.201
be kept simple, Mayor.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.704
[Lisa screams]

06:10.787 --> 06:11.997
Simple.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.915
Pure.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.458
Good.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.460
[groans]

06:20.380 --> 06:23.216
Don't hurt them!
They don't understand!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.510
Who's she talking to?

06:25.594 --> 06:29.598
I believe she's exhorting Satan
not to take revenge on us,

06:29.681 --> 06:33.727
which I suppose is
almost commendable, for a witch.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.522
Perhaps I'll say a prayer for her.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.107
A small one.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.735
[Lisa gasps and coughs]

06:41.818 --> 06:43.445
[panting]

06:43.528 --> 06:46.323
I know it's not your fault, but...

06:46.406 --> 06:48.033
if you can hear...

06:48.116 --> 06:50.744
they don't know what they're doing.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.998
Be better than them. Please!

06:56.416 --> 06:59.044
[screaming]

08:10.281 --> 08:12.283
[distant bell tolls]

08:19.290 --> 08:21.710
[waters babbling]

08:43.732 --> 08:46.568
[wind rises]

08:56.036 --> 08:59.956
[ravens caw]

09:20.643 --> 09:23.104
Are you Mr. Tepes?

09:23.188 --> 09:24.814
She talked about you.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.524
What happened?

09:26.608 --> 09:28.568
Where is my wife?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.571
Ohh. The Bishop took her.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.490
Witchcraft, he said.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.826
They're burning her at the stake.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.829
She was good to me, your wife.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.123
A good doctor.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.334
It's not right what happened.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.961
Where are they holding her?
The cathedral?

09:47.045 --> 09:48.463
Oh.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.173
Oh, no, sir.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.509
Sh-she'll be dead by now.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.803
What?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.930
I couldn't be there.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.348
I don't care what they say.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.102
I won't take joy in that woman
being killed by the Church.

10:02.185 --> 10:05.021
I'm here remembering her instead.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.656
She said to me,

10:14.739 --> 10:18.535
if you would love me as a man,
then live as a man.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.954
Travel as a man.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.956
She said you were traveling.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.833
I was.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.086
The way men do.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.130
Slowly.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.132
No more.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.134
[woman gasps]

10:34.217 --> 10:37.846
I do this last kindness in her name,

10:37.929 --> 10:42.350
she who loved you humans
and cared for your ills.

10:42.433 --> 10:47.105
Take your family and leave
Wallachia tonight.

10:47.188 --> 10:51.985
Pack and go,
and do not look back...

10:53.069 --> 10:54.988
[terrified cry]

10:55.071 --> 10:58.283
for no more do I travel as a man.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.744
Ohh!

11:01.828 --> 11:03.246
[small explosion]

11:15.300 --> 11:17.510
[moaning softly]

11:18.803 --> 11:20.513
[moans]

11:20.597 --> 11:22.932
[gasping]

11:49.417 --> 11:51.419
[bones clatter]

11:53.963 --> 11:58.384
[villagers shouting]

12:00.345 --> 12:03.389
[Mayor]
Ah. There. Quite a show.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.474
Drinks?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.727
[Bishop yawns]
I should minister to the Archbishop.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.272
I fear he's not long for this world,
to be honest.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.650
[Mayor]
Off to heaven with him, eh?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.195
I suppose that's
the ultimate goal for you priests,

12:17.278 --> 12:20.448
serving God
in His true house and all that.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.743
[Bishop] It holds little appeal
for me, to be honest.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.869
[Mayor]
Really?

12:24.953 --> 12:28.081
[Bishop] There's so much left
to be done on earth.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.334
Wallachia could be God's own country

12:31.417 --> 12:33.670
had I but time to burn out

12:33.753 --> 12:37.173
all the evil that hides here.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.342
[low, dispirited moan]

12:39.425 --> 12:40.468
[explosion]

12:40.551 --> 12:41.886
[Mayor gasps]

12:47.225 --> 12:49.435
[roar]

12:49.519 --> 12:51.688
[Dracula]
What have you done?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.231
[Mayor]
Satan!

12:54.983 --> 12:57.777
What have you done to my wife?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.655
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii...</i>

13:00.738 --> 13:02.740
I am Vlad Dracula Tepes,

13:02.824 --> 13:06.869
and you will tell me why this thing
has happened to my wife.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.122
Oh, no! Oh, God!

13:09.205 --> 13:10.415
Dracula!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.125
He was supposed to be myth,

13:12.208 --> 13:14.711
a story made up by heretics!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.171
[Bishop]
She... she's a witch.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.216
Lisa Tepes was a woman of science,

13:20.299 --> 13:25.471
and the one thing that justified
humanity's stench upon this planet.

13:25.555 --> 13:29.142
You are not real.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.644
You are a fiction

13:31.728 --> 13:36.107
that justified the practice
of black magic!

13:36.190 --> 13:37.400
[Dracula]
A fiction!

13:37.483 --> 13:42.113
You take my wife and deny I even exist!

13:43.197 --> 13:46.159
I give you one year, Wallachians.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.953
You have one year to make your peace

13:49.037 --> 13:52.749
and remove any marks
you have made upon the land.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.042
One year,

13:54.125 --> 13:57.795
and then I'll wipe all human life
from the land of Wallachia.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.715
You took that which I love,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.717
so I will take from you

14:02.800 --> 14:04.761
everything you have

14:04.844 --> 14:07.346
and everything you have ever been.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.724
One year.

14:11.225 --> 14:15.313
[unearthly howl]

14:15.396 --> 14:18.316
[shards tinkling]

14:19.567 --> 14:21.027
[terrified gasps]

14:24.113 --> 14:27.617
[panicked cries]

14:34.290 --> 14:36.918
[cries continue]

14:40.713 --> 14:42.215
[glass shatters]

14:44.092 --> 14:46.469
[shards whistling]

14:49.263 --> 14:50.473
[angry cry]

14:51.891 --> 14:54.560
[angry cries]

14:55.561 --> 14:57.105
[panting]

15:00.066 --> 15:01.317
One year!

15:01.401 --> 15:04.570
It will take me one year
to summon an army

15:04.654 --> 15:07.115
from the guts of Hell itself!

15:07.198 --> 15:08.324
[heavy door opens]

15:08.408 --> 15:09.408
[Alucard]
No.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.831
[Dracula]
What do you mean, no?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.418
That woman was
the only reason on earth

15:18.501 --> 15:21.963
for me to tolerate human life!

15:22.046 --> 15:24.590
[Alucard]
Then find the one who did the deed.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.468
If you loose an army of the night
on Wallachia,

15:27.552 --> 15:29.429
you cannot undo it,

15:29.512 --> 15:31.931
and many thousands of people
just as innocent as her

15:32.014 --> 15:33.641
will suffer and die.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.770
There are no innocents! Not anymore!

15:37.854 --> 15:40.690
Any one of them could have
stood up and said,

15:40.773 --> 15:44.402
"No, we won't behave
like animals anymore."

15:44.485 --> 15:47.280
I won't let you do it.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.282
I grieve with you,

15:49.365 --> 15:52.160
but I won't let you commit genocide.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.246
[angry cries]

15:58.416 --> 16:03.045
[choir singing]

16:10.052 --> 16:13.890
[indistinct happy chatter]

16:14.974 --> 16:16.601
[heavy doors open]

16:16.684 --> 16:18.895
[applause]

16:28.070 --> 16:30.281
[applause subsides]

16:33.367 --> 16:35.161
Ahh.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.247
For twenty years have I served you

16:38.331 --> 16:39.749
and God

16:39.832 --> 16:44.337
as the Archbishop
to Targoviste Cathedral.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.424
Yet never before
have I felt the love of God

16:48.508 --> 16:51.552
shine so upon this great city.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.555
A little more than one year ago,

16:54.639 --> 16:56.641
many of us suffered a vision

16:56.724 --> 16:59.352
during the God-willed punishment

16:59.435 --> 17:02.021
of a witch in our midst.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.524
The devil himself came to us

17:04.607 --> 17:08.945
and threatened us with doom in one year.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.031
And yet, here we are.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.741
The devil lied.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.035
Why should we be surprised?

17:16.118 --> 17:19.539
Do we not know the devil for a liar?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.833
Do we not know
his works to be illusion?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.586
Of course we do.

17:25.670 --> 17:30.091
Illusions and falsehoods
hold no fear for us,

17:30.174 --> 17:33.970
for we are the righteous of Targoviste,

17:34.053 --> 17:39.183
living as if cradled in the love of God.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.893
[blood drop splats]

17:45.898 --> 17:47.733
[drops fall heavily]

17:47.817 --> 17:50.236
[rising cries]

17:53.823 --> 17:57.159
[screams and cries]

18:04.625 --> 18:06.544
[feeble shriek]

18:11.716 --> 18:12.967
[pavement cracks]

18:13.050 --> 18:14.260
[glass shatters]

18:18.931 --> 18:21.559
[distant woman screams]

18:24.270 --> 18:26.147
[screams continuing]

18:36.949 --> 18:38.951
[Dracula]
One year.

18:39.952 --> 18:44.999
I gave you one year
to make your peace with your God.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.251
And what do you do?

18:47.335 --> 18:51.130
Celebrate the day
you killed my wife.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.050
One year I gave you,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.136
while I assembled my armies.

18:57.219 --> 19:02.058
And now I bring your death.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.436
You had your chance.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.313
[explosion]

19:07.396 --> 19:09.482
[screams and shouts]

19:21.118 --> 19:25.373
[shutters open violently]

19:28.209 --> 19:29.627
[low snarl]

19:29.710 --> 19:31.462
[shrieking growls]

19:34.006 --> 19:36.425
[screams and shouts]

19:41.263 --> 19:42.723
[no audible scream]

19:42.807 --> 19:45.393
[villagers scream and shout]

19:45.476 --> 19:47.103
[creature shrieks]

19:47.186 --> 19:49.271
[man screams]

19:49.355 --> 19:51.565
[screams and shouts]

19:54.652 --> 19:56.904
[low snarl]

19:56.987 --> 19:58.364
[shriek]

20:16.507 --> 20:18.926
[bats chittering]

20:19.009 --> 20:21.137
Kill everything you see.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.930
Kill them all.

20:23.013 --> 20:27.017
And once Targoviste has been made
into a graveyard for my love,

20:27.101 --> 20:29.687
go forth into the country.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.771
Go now.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.524
Go to all the cities of Wallachia:

20:33.607 --> 20:35.067
Arges! Severin!

20:35.151 --> 20:38.696
Gresit! Chilia! Enisara!

20:38.779 --> 20:41.157
Go now and kill.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.284
Kill for my love!

20:44.285 --> 20:48.122
Kill for the only true love I ever knew.

20:48.205 --> 20:52.710
Kill for the endless lifetime
of hate before me.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.174
[ravens caw]

21:01.510 --> 21:05.181
[wind whispering]

21:05.264 --> 21:08.017
[Bosha]
<i>So I says to him, "It's my goat.</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:10.770
<i>I been tending goats
since I was four years old."</i>

21:10.853 --> 21:12.271
[Kob]
Right, right.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.399
[Bosha] "And I'd know
if my goat was in love with you."

21:15.483 --> 21:16.901
[Kob]
For God's sake.

21:16.984 --> 21:21.197
[Bosha] He says to me,
"I know your goat's in love with me."

21:21.280 --> 21:23.616
So you said how, Bosha?

21:23.699 --> 21:25.534
So I says how!

21:25.618 --> 21:29.038
And he says,
"Well, she fucks me, don't she?"

21:29.121 --> 21:31.373
And that's when you hit him.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.043
Right across the eyes with a shovel.

21:34.126 --> 21:38.506
And now the headman says
I have to pay the bastard money

21:38.589 --> 21:40.216
because he went blind.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.550
Not fair.

21:41.634 --> 21:45.846
So I says to him, "You didn't
think he was gonna go blind

21:45.930 --> 21:48.140
fucking a goat with mange?"

21:48.224 --> 21:50.100
That would have been your fault, too.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.436
I would have gotten blamed for that, too.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.146
But what am I supposed to do

21:54.230 --> 21:57.441
when I find my goat
laying on its side in the field,

21:57.525 --> 21:59.443
fucked within an inch of its life

21:59.527 --> 22:03.864
and a naked man with blood
and straw all over his peck?

22:03.948 --> 22:05.407
Hit him with a shovel!

22:05.491 --> 22:07.660
Fucking right I hit him with a shovel!

22:07.743 --> 22:10.287
More ale for me and my cousin Kob!

22:10.371 --> 22:11.371
Brother.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.959
Look, we might have had
the same father,

22:15.042 --> 22:16.961
but you came out of my aunt.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.755
Don't make me get my shovel.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.841
Anyone else while I'm pouring?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.342
[Trevor]
One over here.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.885
[Piter panting]

22:24.969 --> 22:26.720
Ale! For Christ's sake!

22:27.721 --> 22:28.973
Piter!

22:29.723 --> 22:34.520
We was just wondering if you'd spotted
any attractive sheep on your ride out.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.522
What's the word, mate?

22:36.605 --> 22:37.773
[ale pours]

22:37.856 --> 22:39.483
[greedy slurp]

22:39.567 --> 22:41.193
[panting]

22:41.277 --> 22:43.862
The horde's been seen,
sweeping west!

22:43.946 --> 22:46.365
Shit! You think they'll reach us?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.284
I think they might pass us by.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.994
I don't know. I hope.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.496
I'm told they're closing on Gresit.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.998
Serves 'em right.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.083
Stuck-up bastards.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.585
Ah, come on.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.669
No.

22:58.752 --> 23:02.673
No, it all comes down to the families
and the houses, doesn't it?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.675
The great houses of Gresit.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.759
[hawks and spits]

23:05.843 --> 23:09.305
Vlad Dracula? An old family.

23:09.388 --> 23:13.058
The capital?
All run by the great houses.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.060
And they're not even the worst.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.729
The Belmonts?

23:17.479 --> 23:20.190
We should have killed
all the Belmonts.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.818
Shit.

23:26.155 --> 23:31.535
[choir vocalizing somberly]

24:36.475 --> 24:38.310
[high-pitched voice] <i>Frederator!</i>
