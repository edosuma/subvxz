WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.400
If I betray him, he'll come for me.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.600
I've come from the station.
You're the target.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.360
They could be on their
way to you right now.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.960
You need to clear out the house now.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.640
Col McHugh!
I've reasonable grounds to suspect

00:11.640 --> 00:14.120
you may be carrying stolen
or prohibited articles.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.640
It's just office stuff.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.960
Some printer paper,
packs of Post-It notes.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.080
Ugh!

00:20.080 --> 00:22.040
You tried to set me up this morning.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.560
You've been working against
me for a wee while now.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.520
Ever come after me again, Lou...

00:27.560 --> 00:30.000
Lou, what's happened? Is Owen OK?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.040
I'll explain. Just come home.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.360
It's the last time
we see each other, Lou.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.040
One fucking chance.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.320
Here, take it. I'll be all  right.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.280
I've got a spare buried
under the garden gnome.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.280
Ugh! Me Da'll kill you!

00:43.280 --> 00:46.040
You took the man's son,
got a hiding for it. Fair's fair.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.320
What happened to you?

00:47.320 --> 00:50.320
It's over, like, I don't
work for him any more.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.480
GUNFIRE

00:53.440 --> 00:56.720
I've shot an intruder dead
then set me house on fire.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.480
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.080
It is Monday the 13th of March.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.240
Time is 9:41am.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.840
This interview is being conducted
in room three at Leeds Shipcross,

01:19.840 --> 01:22.400
in attendance are myself,
Detective Inspector Philip Cowper

01:22.400 --> 01:24.480
of Leeds Organised Crime Team and...

01:24.480 --> 01:27.240
Detective Inspector Louisa Slack
of the same unit.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.680
Subject of the interview
is Vernon Francis Marley,

01:30.680 --> 01:32.760
born 6th of June 1951.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.080
Vernon, may I call you Vernon?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.240
You may.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.880
Vernon, you are being
interviewed under caution,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.480
and as such, I will remind you,
you do not have to say anything.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.600
But it may harm your
defence if you do not mention

01:42.600 --> 01:45.400
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.120
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Do you understand?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.080
I have grasped this, yes.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.920
OK, I'd like to start
then by asking you to confirm

01:53.920 --> 01:56.400
the details of a 999
call you made last night.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.120
And if you could describe
in your own words

01:58.120 --> 02:00.120
what happened before
you made the call.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.440
VIDEO:  ..when he takes
out an automatic pistol

02:06.440 --> 02:07.840
and points it at me.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.040
Fearing for my life, I clock him
over the head with a wine bottle.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.040
Don't fret, nothing good.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.480
And he goes down,
but takes me with him.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.440
Now, neither of us is
in the first flush of youth.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.720
I mean, this is
codger on codger crime.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.440
Must've looked like it were
happening in slow motion.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.680
Anyway, he's still coming for me...

02:26.680 --> 02:29.640
And at this point, you,
um, you proceed to, um...

02:29.640 --> 02:35.080
At this point, I proceed in a
timely fashion to my kitchen drawer,

02:35.080 --> 02:37.760
whereupon I retrieve my own shooter.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.840
This is the illegally-owned
Smith and Wesson revolver

02:40.840 --> 02:43.640
you acquired when a serving
police detective in the 1990s,

02:43.640 --> 02:45.200
is that correct?  It is.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.680
Should be in a museum.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.720
I had no idea whether
it would go bang or not.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.160
Anyway, I discharged the weapon,

02:53.160 --> 02:56.360
firing two rounds into his chest.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.920
Some moments after...

02:59.520 --> 03:00.760
..he ceases to be.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.480
You didn't tell him to stop?
Or shout a warning?

03:05.480 --> 03:08.000
As I said,
he'd broken into my house.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.080
We had a lively exchange of views,

03:10.080 --> 03:11.720
then he pulled a gun
and tried to kill me.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.240
So, no, I didn't shout a warning.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.760
Mr Marley, may I remind you
you're under no obligation

03:16.760 --> 03:20.440
to say anything to us
without a solicitor present?

03:20.440 --> 03:22.520
I'm perfectly fine. Thank you.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.200
In my experience, people who
waive their right to a solicitor

03:26.200 --> 03:27.920
usually regret it.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.600
These are serious charges, Vernon.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.920
At your age, with your background,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.960
do you really wanna serve time?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.680
Mr Marley's made his position clear.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.800
I know what I'm doing.
I was a copper half my life.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.880
I'm still in full
possession of my faculties.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.040
Now, the deceased,

03:53.040 --> 03:55.120
Peter Donovan, AKA Bulgey.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.560
Did you know him?
We'd had run-ins over the years.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.600
Around '87, '88,
he tried to extort me.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.400
There was an altercation,
he came off worse,

04:02.400 --> 04:03.960
and he never forgave me.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.600
Why would he wait 35 years
to act on a grudge?

04:08.640 --> 04:12.880
Who knows what goes
on in the criminal mind?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.200
KNOCKING

04:14.200 --> 04:15.440
Sorry, sir.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.840
So, why did you set fire
to your house, Vernon?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.480
Trying to cover my
tracks, weren't I?

04:32.480 --> 04:36.520
Course, soon as I'd lit it,
I realised how bloody stupid it was,

04:36.520 --> 04:39.080
came to my senses, did the
right thing and called it in.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.960
Well, if it was as
you just told us,

04:41.960 --> 04:44.720
an act of self-defence, why would
you need to cover it up at all?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.920
I'd just shot a man dead.
I panicked.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.960
You were a police officer.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.600
Even in a panic, you'd have known
the bullets in Mr Donovan's body

04:51.600 --> 04:54.840
would've been found
in the postmortem.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.520
Like I said,

04:56.520 --> 04:59.000
not thinking straight.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.640
You live alone, yes?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.120
Any visitors?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.760
I keep meself to meself.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.840
Any women visited
the house recently?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.680
Not that I can recall, no.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.120
There's not much
left of your front room,

05:17.120 --> 05:20.480
but one thing SOCOs did
find was a fragment of glass

05:20.480 --> 05:23.320
with a scrape of nude
nail polish on it.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.400
DI Slack, would you show Mr Marley?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.040
Oh, yeah, um...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.320
Brasses.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.320
Beg pardon?  Sorry, yeah.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.760
Sex workers. Every now and
then I get down Holbeck,

05:49.760 --> 05:52.000
pick up a pal for the night.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.200
You got any names?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.680
Oh, yeah, there's Brandi.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.200
There's Sherry and Bacardi,
she's new.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.240
Wait a minute, Slack.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.080
You're not Bill Slack's girl?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.600
I am.  Get her out.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.520
I don't want her here.
I won't be interviewed

06:11.520 --> 06:13.440
by any spawn of that of that prick.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.720
No chance.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.240
DI Slack is an...
You won't get another word out of me

06:17.240 --> 06:19.440
till you get her
out the bloody room.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.760
Now!

06:22.120 --> 06:23.600
Go on, piss off!

06:24.680 --> 06:25.960
It's OK, Phil.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.400
Interview is suspended.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.960
The time is 9:50.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.960
DOOR OPENS

07:53.680 --> 07:55.400
So...

07:55.400 --> 07:57.560
..what was that in
the interview just now?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.920
All you asked him
about was getting him a brief.

08:00.920 --> 08:06.360
Oh, just ticking boxes,
Marley seemed...weird to me.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.000
I was just...duty of care.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.480
I spoke to DC Okoye not long ago.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.000
She's gone on long-term sick.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.480
Stress.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.920
And she's put her bloody ticket in.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.280
What?  What's gone on with you two?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.520
You used to be Batman and Robin.
What did she say?

08:27.520 --> 08:30.200
She no longer feels
she's making a difference.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.360
I asked her if it was to do
with the Col McHugh cock-up.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.160
She refused to discuss it.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.800
Care to shed some light?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.080
San, I'm as shocked as you are.

08:42.040 --> 08:45.920
She didn't talk about where the
intel came from for that stop?

08:45.920 --> 08:48.240
No.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.680
No, I swear. Nowt.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.160
Right, well, it's clear
to me there's something

08:58.160 --> 09:00.040
I'm not being told,
but I'll find out.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.520
SHE SOBS No!

09:23.120 --> 09:24.840
Got the name.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.520
Vernon Marley.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.720
Ex-police, kicked out in the
'90s for being on the take.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.200
You think this could have
anything to do with Lou?

09:37.200 --> 09:38.800
Dirty coppers and that?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.200
Can't think what the angle could be.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.880
Can you?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.360
I'm sorry, boss.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
I know you two were
together a long time.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.080
You know the funny
thing about Bulge?

10:02.080 --> 10:03.760
Hardest man I ever met.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.320
Saved my arse plenty of times.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.880
Never blinked an eye.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.360
But there were so many
things that he couldn't do.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.600
Cook, swim...

10:13.720 --> 10:15.480
..ride a bike, tie his own tie...

10:16.920 --> 10:18.320
..whistle.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.880
Course, you need a childhood
to learn those things, you know?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.240
FAINT SOBBING

10:26.320 --> 10:30.200
Shut the door on the way in,
Curtis, I can't listen to that.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.560
SOBBING CONTINUES

10:43.360 --> 10:46.680
Lou, just sent you charter and
data download for Peter Donovan,

10:46.680 --> 10:47.720
AKA Bulgey,

10:47.720 --> 10:51.080
sent dozens and dozens of texts
to one-and-done burner phones.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.880
Ibbo, is anyone chasing these up?

11:01.880 --> 11:03.840
Just muggins here.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.440
It's probably pointless
without knowing who they went to.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.560
There's no specifics, there's
no names, there's no details,

11:09.560 --> 11:12.160
the locations are pretty vague.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.880
Should I drop it?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.080
Yeah.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.480
What were his name again?
John Davis?

11:18.480 --> 11:20.720
He were the same scrote
from the North Farm robbery.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.000
One that drove a forklift at me.
THEY CHUCKLE

11:23.000 --> 11:26.120
Here, Phil, come on,
remind us what he said.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.440
"Make way, Mr Blobby". THEY LAUGH

11:30.720 --> 11:32.040
Quality, that.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.840
Didn't he ran with
Endri Marku for a bit?

11:36.840 --> 11:39.240
Lou, haven't you got a source
on the inside track on them?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.880
Might give us a lead on
to where they've gone to ground.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.320
Yeah, he's gone quiet on me, though,
think he's skipped the country.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.560
All right, well, um, Ibbo,
can you have a look into Davis,

11:52.560 --> 11:54.320
where he might be?  Yeah, sure.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.560
Phil?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.760
You got a sec?  Yeah.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.160
How was Marley's interview?

12:04.160 --> 12:05.640
Full confession.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.840
Total bollocks, obviously.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.400
We'll have to find
another way to go in.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.760
And where is he now?
Secure med unit, Scarborough.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.240
We can't put him in the
mixer until his arm's sorted.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.520
You all right?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.640
Um, I need a favour.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.520
Truth is my head's a bit... SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

12:20.520 --> 12:24.400
I need to step off the taskforce
and the murder.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.200
Can I have anything
that's not McHugh, but,

12:27.200 --> 12:30.320
I'm gonna free you up to
concentrate on landing the big fish.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.600
What do you reckon?
Sandy'll never go for that.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.120
I can deal with Sandy.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.840
You're more than capable
of handling it on your tod.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.320
Well...

12:38.320 --> 12:39.840
..OK.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.960
Great.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.760
And, Phil...

12:42.760 --> 12:43.960
..I know I take the piss.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.000
Oh, come on, only all the time.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.440
No, I'm an arsehole,
and I go too far.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.720
I'm sorry.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.320
Nah, you're all right, Lou.
Dealt with bullies all my life.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.800
I'll catch you later.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.880
Do you handcuff us to
the bedpost over night?

13:23.880 --> 13:26.240
Only if you give us reason to.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.840
And they're not the furry ones,
if that's what you're thinking.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.800
Look at this.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.880
Nice and peaceful.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.840
Clean bed.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.440
Radiators full blast.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.040
I should've done this years ago.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.440
Well, don't get used to it.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.280
Once that arm's better,
you'll be off.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.480
Hey, Lou, we're heading
for a drink if you fancy it.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.640
No, ta.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.520
Ah, was hoping to buy a few and
get you to tell us why Esther quit.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.360
Can't help you, I'm afraid.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.480
Have a good one, lads.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.560
All right.  All right.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.440
Have a good night.  See ya later.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.960
DOORBELL RINGS

14:33.560 --> 14:36.080
Yes?  Mrs Okoye.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.560
I'm DI Louisa Slack.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.280
Oh, goodness, you're her.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.680
She's not...

14:43.680 --> 14:45.640
She doesn't want to see you.
I'm sorry.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.080
OK, um...

14:50.080 --> 14:51.520
Will you give her a message?

14:53.080 --> 14:55.440
Will you tell her
she's too good to lose.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.960
Will you tell her...we
need people like her.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.120
People who give a shit.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.160
Else nothing will ever change.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.520
Ever, ever, ever.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.360
Will you tell her...

15:12.080 --> 15:13.240
..she's not me.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.240
She's nothing like me.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.120
She's worth 100 of me.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.480
Will you tell her, if
she comes back, I'll quit.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.000
It can't be her.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.440
It's me.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.880
It's all  right,  Mum.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.200
I mean it,
you come back, I'll walk.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.600
I don't care what you do. I'm done.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.880
I can't go back,
knowing what I know.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.560
You used me, you made me part of it.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.520
You've twisted everything.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.840
Me reporting you is still the
right thing to do, but if I do it,

15:53.840 --> 15:56.840
nothing good happens so,
maybe it's not.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.320
I don't know any more.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.640
Est...

16:25.280 --> 16:27.720
Why  you sitting in the dark?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.480
How was the group?  Fine.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.520
What's...what's up with him?

16:38.520 --> 16:42.240
WHISPERS:  I think he's still hoping
that James is gonna show up.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.560
What if he does?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.800
Why would he?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.200
Well, to get back at us
for what I did.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.600
Do you think he will?

16:52.640 --> 16:53.920
Don't know.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.000
Why were you sitting in the dark?

17:02.040 --> 17:04.240
Esther resigned today.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.200
Why?

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
Cos of me.

17:10.840 --> 17:13.000
Is she gonna grass?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.360
I don't think so.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.640
That's good.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.960
What do I do with all the guilt?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.160
You live with it.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.560
Simple as that?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.760
What else can you do?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.440
But if you wanna make
up for what you've done,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.600
you're in the right line of work.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.640
I'm not sure how much
longer I'll be there, Cer.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.840
Even if Esther don't grass,

17:45.840 --> 17:47.960
it's all gonna catch up with me.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.360
Well, if it does...

17:52.360 --> 17:54.480
..there's other ways to be good.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.720
I still wanna burn it.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.200
There's almost 80 grand there.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.920
Think of the lives
that could change.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.720
I don't know what the
right thing to do is.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.400
Don't look at me, pal.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.760
I think we could give it away.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.760
We could divvy it
up into smaller amounts,

18:18.760 --> 18:20.800
and that would look less suspicious.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.240
Who would we give it to?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.680
Doesn't matter, whoever needs it,

18:23.680 --> 18:25.960
as long as we don't keep it.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.520
OK.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.280
So not even to pay off your car?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.280
Can we not make the payments?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.600
It's 700 quid a month, Lou.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.160
It's what?!  Yeah.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.840
OK, let's get started
before I change my mind.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.320
Anything else you need
from us or...  No.  All right.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.280
Thank you very much.  Cheers.  Cheers.
Enjoy her.  Thank you.  Cheers, mate.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.040
Thank you.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.120
What about a donation
to the dog shelter?

18:54.120 --> 18:56.720
Yeah, it can be in Kiwi's name.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.360
Listen carefully,

18:59.360 --> 19:02.200
your client Mehmood Zada is innocent
of the crime he was convicted for.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.880
The person who did it is
Kevin Pearson. P-e-a-r-s-o-n.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.360
He's part of the McHugh crime
organisation with a long record

19:08.360 --> 19:10.360
and is probably at large
somewhere in Ireland.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.760
Did you get all that?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.240
The Scarborough secure med unit,

19:51.240 --> 19:53.280
can't put him in the mixer
until his arm's sorted.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.440
Col McHugh, they have
to be connected, but...

20:05.960 --> 20:07.920
Big nose, you know?  Big nose?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.720
Big...

20:14.200 --> 20:15.880
This is DI Slack.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.480
I put in a personal visitation
request with Vernon Marley.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.720
One sec.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.720
Yeah, sorry, DI Slack, the
prisoner's refused the request.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.440
OK. No worries.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.160
SHE SNIFFLES

21:02.320 --> 21:04.280
Can you lot stand
back for me, please?

21:04.280 --> 21:07.120
Yeah, all right, listen,
we're gonna get this cleared up,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.240
but I need you guys to
stay there, all right?

21:09.240 --> 21:12.080
Stay right there. Stand back for me.
THEY CHATTER

21:12.080 --> 21:14.560
Get it all recorded,
then bag them up, fast.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.680
No forensics?

21:15.680 --> 21:18.400
It'll be like Black Friday at the
big Tesco by the time they get here.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.960
What happened?  The patrol
car spotted a deal, gave chase,

21:20.960 --> 21:23.360
the drivers lost control,
and he's ran off with gear.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.280
Or tried to. When was this?
Few minutes ago.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.200
I reckon he must be pretty close.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.080
We need more people down here, Ibbo.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.720
Feds, go home!  Yeah! Fucking pigs.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.160
CROWD:  Oh!

21:33.160 --> 21:35.000
What you playing at? Hop it.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.400
Any of you see where he went?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.920
Sorry, Miss, we're
from the blind school.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.440
All  right,  that's enough.
Lads, don't be that cliche.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.600
Just a bit of help, come on.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.880
Are you deaf? Fuck off!
Go do your job, go on!

21:45.880 --> 21:47.480
Ta, thanks for your help.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.200
Do you give these young men
a lot of reasons to help you?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.600
No, probably not.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.800
Well, then.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.760
How about you wait until
the rowdy ones get bored,

21:57.760 --> 21:59.720
then see who's still hanging about.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.280
Looking for a job in
the police, by any chance?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.520
You're all  right.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.480
PHONE RINGS

22:25.960 --> 22:27.240
Police.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.760
Look, I really don't have
the patience for a caper.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.400
Slack, man, this aftercare
is getting next level, man.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.320
Most of the boys in here do
not get visits from the feds.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.760
What can I say?

23:15.760 --> 23:18.880
I go the extra mile for my clients.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.200
Yeah, I heard about Bulgey.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.080
That's fucked up, man.
What happened there?

23:24.080 --> 23:26.480
I don't know,
some old grudge, we think.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.240
What have you heard?

23:29.240 --> 23:31.600
Nobody tells me nowt.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.760
What's up?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.480
You must really want
something this time.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.080
Did you look into those courses?

23:36.080 --> 23:39.160
Oh, yeah.
I'm proper teacher's pet now.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.000
I've just started ELC.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.120
I'm doing Art Therapy,
Adult Literacy...

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
I'm smashing it at that one,
by the way.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.920
And, uh, yeah, the guy just
reckons I'm not actually thick.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.240
I was bare shocked.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.080
That's great.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.560
What about, you know...

23:56.640 --> 23:58.760
..living clean?

23:58.760 --> 24:00.240
Would you pass a piss test?

24:00.240 --> 24:01.600
With flying colours, man.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.000
Well, well done you.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.640
But, yeah, there
is something I wanted.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.560
I actually wanted to
introduce you to someone.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.520
Gwen?

24:11.520 --> 24:12.680
This is Gwen.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.760
She's from the
Yorkshire Resettlement Project.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.200
Gwen, this is Noel.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.800
You all  right,  Noel?

24:18.800 --> 24:21.160
They help sort out
prisoners when they come out.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.920
You know, support them with a
job, a place, whatever they need.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.120
Start planning for your future.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.720
A job?

24:29.720 --> 24:32.320
Slack, I have got a boss, remember?

24:32.320 --> 24:34.480
Noel...

24:34.480 --> 24:37.880
..Col cannot define who you are
or what you want to be.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.320
I can send some stuff to you,
about what we do.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.880
Yeah.  No offence, but, do I
look like a charity case to you?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.320
No, you don't.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.000
What we're saying is, you're gonna
have options when you come out.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.640
Plenty of them, I promise.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.320
Your life ain't defined by this.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.160
Have you got a son, yeah?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.480
Yeah, why?

25:00.480 --> 25:02.280
Did you mess him up, or summat?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.200
Does he hate you?

25:04.200 --> 25:06.400
Why would you say that?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.520
Cos you're in here
trying to play Mum to me.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.360
I guess I'll see you later then.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.000
Ta, Gwen.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.600
Sorry to waste your time.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.040
You didn't. He's reachable.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.000
Uh-oh.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.680
Me and you...  Mm-hm?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.600
We're going out-out.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.160
Are we?

25:45.160 --> 25:47.480
Whatever it is, I hope you sort it.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.400
Can we afford this?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.560
Why does it taste so much
better when you don't know

26:07.560 --> 26:10.040
how you're gonna pay for it?

26:10.040 --> 26:11.760
Cos it's a treat again.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.640
Did I look like I needed one?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.800
HE CHUCKLES

26:15.920 --> 26:19.040
Don't worry. If it's too
expensive, we'll just leg it.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.360
I'm sorry.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.720
What for?

26:24.760 --> 26:26.120
I pushed you into this life.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.160
You never asked for it...  Stop.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.280
I've been thinking about this.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.000
Yes.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.840
You heard the grinding
noise in me heard.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.080
Yes, you can see the
smoke coming out me ears.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.400
You dazzle me.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.640
You always have.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.040
You've run rings round me forever.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.520
Everyone knows that.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.880
You could make me put
me foot in a blender.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.160
But unfortunately, I'm a grown-up,

26:57.160 --> 26:59.960
so none of that
lets me off the hook.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.040
You're right,
I never wanted any of this.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.320
But I wanted you.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.920
How is he?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.440
This is the third day in a row.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.440
What's he doing?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.880
Boss.

27:37.880 --> 27:38.920
Curtis.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.760
Everything...all  right?

27:42.800 --> 27:44.760
Not really, no.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.640
This corner of the field

27:46.640 --> 27:49.960
always gets waterlogged
every time it rains.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.320
I tried spiking it,
but that's done sod all.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
Now the internet
tells me that I need

27:56.320 --> 27:58.120
to turn the soil
with sand, you know.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.440
Does that look flat to you?

28:03.640 --> 28:06.160
The old copper who shot Bulge,

28:06.160 --> 28:08.960
he's been moved into a proper nick.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.720
What do you want to happen?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.360
We can't let this one go.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.600
You handle it.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.200
I'll back your call, whatever it is.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.240
But I've got this shit to sort.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.320
Col...

28:23.320 --> 28:25.440
..Bulgey's gone.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.080
We don't have Slack
looking out for us any more.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.240
We need a plan.

28:31.600 --> 28:37.040
Or, if you like, I could take
care of things for a while.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.120
Just as long as you're sorting...

28:40.120 --> 28:41.440
..this kind of thing.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.840
Yeah. Sounds good.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.000
Thanks.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.280
What did he say?

28:57.280 --> 28:59.120
Nothing for you to worry about.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.200
We're all good.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.280
Wait, Curtis!

29:07.280 --> 29:09.080
Come on, wipe your feet!

29:55.720 --> 29:57.640
You all  right?

30:04.960 --> 30:08.000
I don't recall booking an
appointment with the hygienist.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.920
This from Col McHugh?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.240
You sure you're up for this, lad?

30:34.880 --> 30:37.240
You and me,

30:37.240 --> 30:39.520
we can go to the screws right now,

30:39.520 --> 30:41.800
tell them you're being
coerced to commit a crime.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.400
You'll be in a different
nick by tomorrow.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.840
Then it'll be both of us...

30:47.840 --> 30:49.080
..or me mum.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.280
Yeah, aye, well.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.360
Do us a favour then, eh?

31:01.760 --> 31:04.000
Don't balls it up.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.280
Help! Help!

31:06.280 --> 31:08.400
Argh! Argh! Oh!

31:08.400 --> 31:09.920
Ugh! Uh!

31:09.920 --> 31:11.440
Argh!

31:13.680 --> 31:15.880
I'm sorry.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.040
HE EXHALES DEEPLY I'm sorry.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.400
You're all  right.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.960
Ugh, uh...

31:22.960 --> 31:24.960
Oh, ugh.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.280
Argh!

31:27.280 --> 31:30.160
Ugh, ugh!

31:33.200 --> 31:34.920
Don't you move, Wilkes!

31:34.920 --> 31:37.120
Control from Bravo three,
urgent message.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.320
RADIO: Do not approach.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.240
Ma'am!

31:54.560 --> 31:57.440
Vernon Marley just
got shanked in Oakdale.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.240
He were gone before even
the medics got his cell.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.320
Kid knew what he was doing.  Shit!

32:02.320 --> 32:04.880
What kid?  Noel Wilkes.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.360
Twat with a gun you
talked down, remember?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.120
He's with Col McHugh.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.320
It all fits.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.680
Right, clear the meeting room.
Taskforce, ten minutes.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.840
Yes, ma'am.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.280
So maybe you're right.
Maybe there's no way out.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.960
No free way out, no.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.000
SIRENS WAIL

33:12.840 --> 33:14.280
I'm sorry about this,

33:14.280 --> 33:16.920
but the gentleman's effects
still haven't been claimed.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.280
The local authority
should have sorted it, but, um...

33:20.280 --> 33:22.360
Uh, OK, I'll take 'em.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.240
Ta.  Ta.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.080
SNIFFLES

34:11.320 --> 34:13.160
KNOCKING

34:15.440 --> 34:17.600
Louisa?  Hi, Mum.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.320
You all  right?  What's wrong?

34:20.320 --> 34:22.040
Nothing. I'm fine.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.000
Am I gonna be the first person
in 50 years to come to your door

34:26.000 --> 34:27.600
and not be offered tea and gata?

34:33.920 --> 34:36.280
How are you? How is everything?

34:36.280 --> 34:38.320
The church, your friends?

34:38.320 --> 34:39.720
All fine.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.160
Why now, Louisa?

34:43.160 --> 34:45.040
You never do things
without a reason.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.680
Um...

34:49.200 --> 34:53.160
I wanted to thank you for
being so good with Owen.

34:53.160 --> 34:56.000
Coming to the hospital,
bringing him things.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.640
The night Owen got ill...

35:04.640 --> 35:07.120
..I asked Ceri to come out with me.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.160
And he said no, he stayed home.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.800
But if he hadn't...

35:16.560 --> 35:18.400
When you were a little girl,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.000
whenever you were sick,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.560
I used to blame myself.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.000
Every mother does.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.600
He adores you.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.760
Why would he not?
I'm his grandmother.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.960
I adore him.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.160
He's a ridiculous boy, but...

35:42.400 --> 35:45.720
How have you always got
this many ready to go?

35:45.720 --> 35:47.920
People from the church come.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.720
I can't give them nothing.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.480
You never used to like my sweets.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.440
Mmm, I never used to eat them.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.480
Don't mean I didn't like them.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.760
Hold on.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.800
You haven't commented on how
I'm too thin or too fat yet.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.760
And you haven't blasphemed.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.320
I've been thinking a
lot about Dad recently.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.960
I feel like maybe I was...too
young to get to know him properly.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.400
He could do no wrong in your eyes.

36:37.400 --> 36:41.760
Yeah, but I think if
he'd lived longer...

36:41.760 --> 36:44.280
..I would've
started to see some stuff.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.440
Perhaps.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.720
Was he good at his job?

36:52.000 --> 36:55.720
It was very important to him
that everybody thought so.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.880
Can I ask you a question?  Mm?

37:00.440 --> 37:04.360
And I'm not taking the
piss - the mickey - I swear.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.720
Do you think Dad's in heaven?

37:05.720 --> 37:07.200
Of course.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.600
Well, he didn't believe.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.640
He had good in him. He loved you.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.600
And God has a father's heart.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.960
Is anyone beyond saving?

37:21.280 --> 37:22.480
No.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.800
Said his headache's better.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.920
Oh, good.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.720
Come here for a sec.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.040
Eh?  Come here.

37:43.040 --> 37:47.160
Do you remember that bloke that was
shot in Seacroft a few weeks ago?

37:47.160 --> 37:48.520
I heard something. Why?

37:53.720 --> 37:55.640
Why didn't you say?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.120
Wanna know who did it?

37:58.560 --> 38:02.560
Vernon was the one helping me
figure out what to do about Col.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.440
I was there.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.240
Bulgey tried to kill me.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.400
Vernon saved me.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.480
Vernon was killed
in prison last week.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.760
Do you remember that lad that
I pinched? One of Col's, Noel?

38:16.760 --> 38:17.920
Col had him do it.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.360
Retaliation.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.560
And I went to
Vernon's funeral today.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.480
So I know everything we said,

38:29.480 --> 38:31.960
and everything we agreed,

38:31.960 --> 38:34.240
but all of this is because of me.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.680
So I have to stop him for good.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.840
I'll take Owen to me Mum and Dad's.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.760
We'll leave in the morning.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.080
What shall I tell him?

39:02.080 --> 39:03.840
Part of the truth.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.040
Not all of it.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.680
I'll just...I'll tell him
this trip's open-ended,

39:09.680 --> 39:11.680
but can you go and talk to him, now?

39:13.360 --> 39:15.440
Don't tell him anything
that'll put him at risk,

39:15.440 --> 39:17.000
just, you know, find a way.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.520
OK.  You're good with words.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.840
MUSIC PLAYS

41:25.520 --> 41:26.760
This isn't wise.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.280
Neither is you answering.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.680
What do you want?

41:30.680 --> 41:33.000
I know you said we'd
never see each other again,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.800
and if that is the case, there's
something I need to give ya.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.360
What is it?

41:37.360 --> 41:38.960
I can't say on the phone.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.200
Right, I'll send a runner.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.600
No.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.640
I need to give it to you myself.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.200
It comes with an explanation.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.320
OK, I'm hanging up.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.480
Wait.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.000
Aoife left a note.

41:53.520 --> 41:54.760
Wh-What?

41:56.520 --> 41:59.920
When I found her, I told you
there wasn't anything, but...

42:01.200 --> 42:04.080
..I just...that was a lie.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.840
I just didn't want you to read it.

42:06.840 --> 42:09.160
But I had no right.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.720
So if we really are finished,
then...you should have it.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.320
You've still got it?

42:22.320 --> 42:23.920
Right here in my hand.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.280
All  right.  I'll meet you.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.120
Just...just me and you, yeah?

42:30.120 --> 42:31.760
Our place.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.880
Tonight.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.360
Fine. Give me an hour.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.280
That'll do.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.280
Oh.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.840
Vernon Marley was me friend.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.160
He was helping me.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.200
Why else would
Bulgey have been there?

43:23.200 --> 43:25.800
He followed me to do me in.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.680
Vernon shot him, to save me.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.760
And took the rap too?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.520
Good friend.  Yeah, he was.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.200
Why'd you have to use Noel?

43:42.200 --> 43:43.920
He could've still had a life, Col.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.840
So, pop a hole in me and be
done with it, is that the idea?

43:48.840 --> 43:50.160
I'm all out of ideas.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.000
I know I have to stop you.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.880
Cos I'm the only one that can.
Have to?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.840
Is that your promise
to the big man, Lou?

44:00.640 --> 44:04.400
It weren't to him, Col,
and you know that.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.040
Do you think you could do it?

44:06.040 --> 44:07.360
GUN COCKS

44:09.560 --> 44:10.840
HE CHUCKLES

44:12.840 --> 44:14.720
Well, that's the first bit.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.280
You know, I used to think
I wouldn't be able to.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.040
But now that we're here...

44:25.040 --> 44:26.120
Go on.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.800
Go on.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.360
Go on.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.520
I'm not gonna shoot you.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.560
I can't - you're like a brother.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.360
Why are you here, Lou?

44:53.920 --> 44:55.240
To beg for mercy.

44:56.640 --> 45:00.480
So tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
go into my DCI and my Super,

45:00.480 --> 45:03.680
and I'm gonna tell them
everything about us.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.880
I'm going to accept any
punishment they see fit,

45:06.880 --> 45:10.000
and I'm going to co-operate fully
in any operation they cook up

45:10.000 --> 45:11.280
to put you away.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.120
It may very well not work,
we both know that.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.920
I've got no concrete on you.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.160
But that is what I'm gonna do.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.200
And what's the angle?

45:28.200 --> 45:29.640
No angle, no deal.

45:32.200 --> 45:35.520
You said if I came for you again,
all bets were off.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.560
Well, I have come for you again.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.280
So all I'm asking...

45:43.440 --> 45:45.200
..is that you don't hurt me family.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.760
And the gun's for what? Is that
to show me what I would've won?

45:55.760 --> 45:57.360
It's not a trick. Take it.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.800
Take it.

46:06.120 --> 46:09.400
You've got the power, Col.
You've always had the power.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.560
But I'm just asking you...

46:11.760 --> 46:13.400
..this one thing...

46:13.400 --> 46:17.280
..please, please
don't hurt me family.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.920
You're appealing
to my better nature?

46:20.920 --> 46:22.600
Yeah. I am.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.200
I'd like to see Aoife's note now.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.560
Col...  The note.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.680
Give it to me.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.880
I had to make sure you'd come.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.200
You see, I knew you were lying.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.640
How?

46:54.440 --> 46:57.520
Because you weren't the
first one to find her, Lou.

46:57.520 --> 47:00.040
You weren't the
first one to find her.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.120
See, I went home that night.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.320
After she started
sending those texts.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.400
Aoife! Aoife!

47:10.600 --> 47:13.240
We didn't bring you into this
world for you to behave like this!

47:13.240 --> 47:17.840
OK! Why are your problems so
much bigger than everyone else's?!

47:24.680 --> 47:25.800
There she was.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.440
She left us a note.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.040
Read it to me.

48:19.480 --> 48:20.720
"Dear Mum and Donny,

48:22.040 --> 48:23.280
"I love you, but I'm sorry,

48:23.280 --> 48:26.120
"but I'm not meant to be here.
Love, Aoife."

48:31.040 --> 48:33.120
Go on.

48:33.120 --> 48:36.800
"Dad, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you."

48:36.800 --> 48:38.360
There we go.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.160
What are you
supposed to do with that?

48:42.720 --> 48:45.360
Got in my car, and just drove.
Drove and drove and drove.

48:45.360 --> 48:46.640
Going nowhere.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.800
And then when I eventually
snapped out of it, I called you.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.440
It's Aoife, it's Aoife.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.560
She, um...

48:58.240 --> 49:00.400
..she sent a message,
she's at the house.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.760
Alone.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.280
Can you go check on her?

49:04.280 --> 49:06.160
Please?

49:06.160 --> 49:07.800
Please.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.680
I couldn't go back.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.000
You know I couldn't.

49:15.240 --> 49:18.760
Couldn't see her
again like that, you know?

49:18.760 --> 49:21.760
And I didn't want
anyone to know about...

49:21.760 --> 49:23.000
..about the note.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.240
After we buried her,
I realised, that I had no choice,

49:32.240 --> 49:34.520
you know, I had to keep going cos

49:34.520 --> 49:37.360
so much of it relies
on me being me, you know?

49:39.520 --> 49:40.800
But I wasn't.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.960
When I saw...

49:51.960 --> 49:55.040
..saw my daughter lying
there, I mean...

49:58.120 --> 50:01.320
..the fire went out.

50:01.320 --> 50:03.000
The fire went out.

50:05.640 --> 50:09.200
But you've been expanding
and going harder, Col.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.960
Thought the engine'd start again,
if I just kept kicking it, you know?

50:15.960 --> 50:18.520
But it hasn't, you know. I'm gone.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.000
I'm gone, Lou.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.400
Can't pretend any more.

50:24.400 --> 50:28.280
When she was little, Aoife
was my spit, you know? She was...

50:29.960 --> 50:31.800
..single-minded, fierce as fuck.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.720
I loved that about her. HE CRIES

50:36.800 --> 50:40.560
And I wanted her to be the one
to take over someday, you know?

50:40.560 --> 50:42.640
Then she started
seeing me differently.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.240
You know, she went another way.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.600
So what do I do? I tried to stop it.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.960
Tried to make her into something
else.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.320
I just wouldn't let her be.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.840
And then she started
on the gear, you know,

50:59.840 --> 51:01.880
and I thought she was
doing that to hurt me.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.400
You know, I mean, she hated me,
right enough, but...

51:06.320 --> 51:08.720
..she wasn't.

51:08.720 --> 51:13.080
She wasn't doing it to hurt me,
she was...

51:16.200 --> 51:18.880
She was just trying
to get away, you know?

51:20.880 --> 51:23.000
She was just trying to get away.

51:29.080 --> 51:32.000
I know who you made that promise to.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.520
What?

51:33.520 --> 51:34.840
Owen.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.520
He was lying there
in the hospital, right?

51:38.520 --> 51:41.800
He was dying, or near enough.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.760
You promised him that...

51:45.160 --> 51:48.800
..if he just came back to you,
things'd be different, right?

51:51.480 --> 51:53.280
You were calling him back to you.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.640
What do we do now?

52:10.160 --> 52:11.720
Don't know.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.440
I look at everything I've built,

52:16.440 --> 52:18.560
everything I've done to get it.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.800
Big ol' pile of nothing, isn't it?

52:37.200 --> 52:38.280
Come in with me.

52:40.800 --> 52:41.920
What?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.560
Come in with me tonight.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.600
Let's go together
and tell them everything.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.840
HE SCOFFS

52:54.440 --> 52:56.640
Jesus Christ, you're serious?

52:56.640 --> 52:58.720
Everything we've done.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.800
What have we got
to show for it, Col?

53:01.800 --> 53:05.080
We both want it to end.
We both know we have to pay.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.200
There is no way out.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.400
I know.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.680
This is exactly
what we're looking for.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.080
GUN SPLASHES

53:38.080 --> 53:39.440
OK.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.760
Let's go.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.160
Let's go.

54:00.320 --> 54:03.800
You know, in 20 years,
you ever driven me?

54:05.240 --> 54:06.760
Not in the front.

54:11.240 --> 54:13.600
How's the ride?

54:13.600 --> 54:15.880
It's smooth. Not bad.
Not bad at all.

54:17.680 --> 54:20.280
# I'm scared of
the things I think of

54:21.360 --> 54:24.440
# When night comes along

54:24.440 --> 54:28.920
# Something gets hold of me... #

54:28.920 --> 54:30.760
Col?

54:30.760 --> 54:31.800
Yeah?

54:31.800 --> 54:33.280
# I can't see.. #

54:33.280 --> 54:34.520
Is this real?

54:34.520 --> 54:36.680
# It's a wicked world

54:36.680 --> 54:39.960
# Awaits the ones
our young girls bear

54:39.960 --> 54:47.320
# Oh, I need somebody to hold me

54:47.320 --> 54:54.360
# In the fading light
of this coming night... #

54:54.360 --> 54:56.200
Here we are.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.800
Aye. Here we are.

54:58.800 --> 55:02.360
# ..of this coming night

55:17.440 --> 55:21.160
# How many whores have
walked through that door

55:21.160 --> 55:24.800
# Layin' by my side
and climbed in my mind

55:24.800 --> 55:26.800
# And taken me... #

55:26.800 --> 55:27.960
Col?

55:27.960 --> 55:32.320
# Down to where the heat

55:32.320 --> 55:35.920
# Blisters the skin upon my feet

55:35.920 --> 55:40.920
# Makes me reach out
and weep for the days

55:40.920 --> 55:47.200
# When I was pure of
heart and slept in peace... #

55:55.600 --> 55:56.960
BUZZER RINGS

55:58.480 --> 56:00.320
Someone'll be down in a minute.

56:17.400 --> 56:21.000
# Oh, it's a wicked world

56:21.000 --> 56:24.840
# Awaits the ones
our young girls bear

56:24.840 --> 56:32.400
# Oh, I need somebody to hold me

56:32.400 --> 56:36.240
# In the fading light

56:36.240 --> 56:39.960
# Of this coming night

56:39.960 --> 56:44.720
# In the fading light

56:44.720 --> 56:46.800
# Of this coming night

56:54.720 --> 56:58.400
# In the fading light

56:58.400 --> 57:00.960
# Of this coming night

57:02.160 --> 57:06.920
# In the fading light

57:06.920 --> 57:11.120
# Of this is the night. #
