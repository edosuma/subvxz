WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.091
(phone ringing,
distant chatter)

00:08.800 --> 00:11.360
CLARKE:
So, you're the newest member
ofﬁﬁgaﬁon?

00:11.410 --> 00:14.072
Newest returning member
of litigation.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.078
I left and came back.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.670
And do you believe you've made
a worthy contribution

00:18.710 --> 00:20.439
in the time
you've been here?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.243
Since I've been back here?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.542
Yes. Yes, I do.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.558
I tried 140 cases as an ASA.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.808
That mal_<es me an asset
on criminal cases.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.418
And do you
have family here?

00:30.460 --> 00:32.223
In Chicago?

00:32.260 --> 00:34.228
Um, no, I'm married to my work.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.727
(laughs)

00:35.760 --> 00:39.059
And if the firm had to downsize
the litigation department,

00:39.100 --> 00:41.330
tell me why
we should keep you over, say...

00:41.370 --> 00:43.531
Alicia Florrick.

00:43.570 --> 00:46.607
Um, well, I have more
transactional experience.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.301
Also more billable hours.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.743
And I-I don't like saying it,
but some partners have...

00:52.780 --> 00:55.340
issues with Alicia.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.780
Hmm. And what are those?

00:57.820 --> 00:59.811
Those issues?

01:01.260 --> 01:03.228
The office she's in.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.228
It's the largest
of any fourth-year,

01:05.260 --> 01:07.455
and it's the only one
on the twenty-eighth floor.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.718
And if the firm
had to downsize,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.624
tell me why
we should keep you

01:11.670 --> 01:13.228
over other _
fourth-year assocnates.

01:13.270 --> 01:14.737
I'm good.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.105
Better than-- let's see--

01:21.140 --> 01:23.108
John Gaultner?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.316
I'm not playing that game,
Mr. Hayden.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.840
What game?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.484
Thunderdome.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.318
Lawyers only, sir.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.554
(laughs)

01:40.600 --> 01:42.591
You here to see if I screw up?

01:42.630 --> 01:45.190
Just wishing you good luck
your first case back.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.391
And look at you
with all your little tabs.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.135
Like a good first-year.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.138
Here you go.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.398
(laughs)

01:52.440 --> 01:54.237
Introduction to Trial Law,
just in case.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.736
(laughing)

01:55.780 --> 01:57.338
How's this
for ironies, Will?

01:57.380 --> 02:00.349
I was there at the end,
now I'm here at the beginning.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.517
Good luck.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.142
Thanks, Lionel.
I heard you were on this.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.283
I'm looking forward
to getting into it.
Yeah.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.882
Good first case.
Mm-hmm.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.319
He's tired.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.158
And his theory of
the case is weak.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.158
Just imagine how embarrassing
it'll be if you don't beat him.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.622
Okay, thanks.
You can go now.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.661
(laughs)

02:20.600 --> 02:24.866
CROWD (chanting):
No to NATO! No to war!
No to NATO! No to war!

02:24.910 --> 02:26.901
No to NATO! No to war!
(Siren blaring)

02:26.940 --> 02:29.602
No to NATO! No to war! No to...

02:29.650 --> 02:31.641
(overlapping shouting
and chatter)

02:33.650 --> 02:35.242
That was taken

02:35.280 --> 02:36.918
during the anti-NATO
demonstrations last May?

02:36.950 --> 02:39.350
Yes.
And who is that there?

02:39.390 --> 02:41.551
I believe that's Tyler Beacham,
the assailant.

02:41.590 --> 02:42.818
You mean the victim?

02:42.860 --> 02:43.929
Objection.

02:43.960 --> 02:44.824
Actually, both characterizations
seem objectionable.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.748
Let's just leave it
as "Mr. Beacham."

02:46.800 --> 02:47.926
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.894
Mr. Beacham _is the
son of my client.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.864
Correct?
MAN :
Yes.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.164
And she's suing the city of
Chicago for wrongful death?

02:55.270 --> 02:57.704
(overlapping shouting)

03:00.480 --> 03:01.970
MAN:
Down!

03:02.010 --> 03:03.341
Down!

03:03.380 --> 03:04.802
(people screaming)
Get back!

03:04.850 --> 03:05.976
Get back!

03:06.010 --> 03:07.773
Stop him!

03:07.820 --> 03:08.775
MAN 2:
Get off me!

03:08.820 --> 03:09.844
WOMAN:
You're killing him!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.915
Get off me! Get off me!

03:11.950 --> 03:12.985
(yells)

03:13.020 --> 03:17.889
That's you shooting Mr. Beacham
with a stun gun...

03:17.930 --> 03:19.454
He charged at me.
He kept charging at me.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.320
The video doesn't show all that.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.624
WILL:
And how many times did you send
40,000 volts through his body?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.695
Objection, Your Honor.
The stun gun

03:25.730 --> 03:27.664
is set at
40,000, but when

03:27.700 --> 03:29.668
the probes make contact
with the skin,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.564
the voltage drops to 1,400.

03:31.610 --> 03:34.431
IfI remember my Harvard physics
class correctly, Mr. Deerfield,

03:34.480 --> 03:35.879
I believe you're right.
Sustained.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.002
1,400 volts.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.006
That's much better.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.642
(indistinct shouting)

03:40.680 --> 03:43.410
Stop it! Tyler.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.589
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

03:45.620 --> 03:47.258
(siren blaring)

03:47.290 --> 03:49.520
WILL:
How many times did you jolt him
with 1,400 volts?

03:49.560 --> 03:50.686
MAN:
Three times.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.288
WILL:
And what happened
after you shot him

03:52.330 --> 03:53.649
the third time
with 1,400 volts?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.019
Nothing. He wasn't moving.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.869
I radioed
for medical help, but...

03:56.900 --> 03:58.265
But he died before they arrived.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.291
(sighs)

04:01.840 --> 04:04.263
Help him! Help him!

04:04.310 --> 04:05.334
(indistinct shouting)

04:05.370 --> 04:06.598
What happened?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.471
Down!

04:08.510 --> 04:09.602
(indistinct shouting)

04:09.650 --> 04:12.346
(siren blaring,
overlapping shouting)

04:22.990 --> 04:24.287
Here it is.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.321
Go ahead.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.768
$800,000.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.563
VVhoa!

04:35.600 --> 04:37.807
Nice sum
for the first time out.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.400
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile, Mr. Hayden.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.340
I smile. Good job.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.540
WILL:
Let's throw it back.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.740
DIANE:
What?

04:44.780 --> 04:46.008
WILL:
We can do better.
I haven't even

04:46.050 --> 04:47.369
questioned the fiance.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.409
Will, this is a good offer.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.338
The city doesn't like to pay
on wrongful death.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.311
You won. Say yes.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.681
Let me have the fiance.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.551
She'll have the jury in tears.
We can double this.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.626
No.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.857
Actually, it's not
up to you, Mr. Hayden.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.424
You represent our creditors.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.395
As such, you can tell us
not to take a case.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.795
But you can't tell us
when to take an award.

05:05.830 --> 05:06.967
That's up to the client.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.991
(sighs)

05:12.480 --> 05:15.574
This is how you
got into this hole.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.339
Placing passion
over pragmatism.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.480
He came close to crossing
the line there, didn't he?

05:23.520 --> 05:25.943
He did. We pushed back,
appropriately.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.617
So where are we?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.754
We need $60 million
to get out of debt.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.655
David Lee has pulled in
some receivables.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.622
Cuesta paid up.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.423
Sweeney's been good.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.825
Leaving us well on our way
with $2 million.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.438
He's forcing us to
sell the 27th floor.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.438
We'll be like
steerage up here.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.438
I know.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.506
And yet, you
seem... becalmed.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.144
Our landlord went bankrupt.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.569
I saw that, but somebody
took over our lease.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.019
Maddie Hayward.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.484
Right, the semiconductor lady.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.512
I think I'm missing
why this is good.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.085
Maddie is a new member
of Emily's List.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.927
You know her?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.120
Enough.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.127
You'll talk to her?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.560
Well, doesn't hurt to ask.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.431
You'll win this case, right?

06:12.470 --> 06:14.461
Doing my best.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.401
Help him in court.
ALICIA:
Will?

06:19.440 --> 06:20.668
He's fine.

06:20.710 --> 06:21.972
I know.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.944
He's better _
when he has someone to Impress.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.619
John Gaultner's on it.
I'll tell him.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.174
No. John's been let go.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.175
VVhen?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.585
An hour ago.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.110
The trustee made cuts.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.889
Kalinda, where the hell are you?

06:35.920 --> 06:39.720
This is my fourth call.
I need you on this case.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.524
(children laughing)

06:52.580 --> 06:55.003
You left me.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.008
Yep.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.473
You left me hanging.
My lowest point.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.511
I wish I'd seen your face.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.516
Two years inside,
I get out,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.814
I expect my loving
wife to be there.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.556
Instead, you take my money,
and you burn my clothes.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.721
Did you cry?

07:20.740 --> 07:22.708
Seriously.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.561
Did it make you cry?

07:26.840 --> 07:29.900
I don't remember
you being such a bitch.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.475
You have a bad memory.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.618
Do you remember this?

07:37.650 --> 07:39.652
(children chattering)

07:45.790 --> 07:47.894
Huh?

07:50.030 --> 07:52.965
I remember
you being better at it.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.986
WOMAN:
Sheryl Sandberg thinks
we ca have it all.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.248
Anne-Marie Savage

08:17.290 --> 08:19.019
thinks we can't have it all.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.096
All I can think is,
uh, what the hell?

08:21.130 --> 08:22.392
(laughter)

08:22.430 --> 08:26.594
Have you ever heard a man wonder
if h could have it all?

08:26.640 --> 08:27.868
(applause)

08:27.900 --> 08:31.768
So why are we saddled
with so much... guilt?

08:31.810 --> 08:33.801
I have enough Catholic
and Jewish guilt.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.001
Now I'm getting feminist guilt.
Thank you very much.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.576
(laughter and applause)

08:37.610 --> 08:38.645
Maddie?

08:38.680 --> 08:39.874
Yes?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.717
Diane, right?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.115
Right. Lockhart/Gardner.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.141
I hear we're going
to be neighbors.
We are?

08:45.190 --> 08:46.987
Oh, that's right. Of course.

08:47.020 --> 08:49.250
Uh, you're on the 28th floor?

08:49.290 --> 08:51.622
27th through the 29th.
Wow.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.321
Well, we will be right
above and below you,

08:53.360 --> 08:56.090
so if you ever want to
borrow a cup of sugar...

08:56.130 --> 08:57.267
Nice meeting you.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.222
Actually, uh, Maddie,

08:59.270 --> 09:00.999
maybe we could
talk sometime.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.009
I hate to mention this, but,
uh, you're our new landlord,

09:04.040 --> 09:07.339
_ and we would love
to discuss some relief on a new

09:07.380 --> 09:08.335
payment schedule.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.109
I'm on my way
to another meeting right now,

09:10.150 --> 09:11.344
but why don't you put together
a proposal

09:11.380 --> 09:12.278
and give my team a call?

09:12.310 --> 09:14.016
Because that's really
who you should be

09:14.050 --> 09:15.642
speaking to
on this.
Thank you.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.648
Wonderful speech.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.214
Oh.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.616
You_have someo_ne
working at your firm,

09:21.660 --> 09:23.082
uh, that I read about.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.324
Someone in litigation?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.022
Yes. Will Gardner.
No.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.699
That woman
that stood by her husband.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.594
Alicia Florrick.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.837
Yes. She's a fourth-year
associate.
Hmm.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.337
I read an interview with her.

09:34.370 --> 09:37.066
Yes, actually, she's on
the reorganization committee.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.600
Great. Have her call.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.170
(sighs)

09:46.210 --> 09:48.269
WILL:
Would you like
to take a moment?

09:50.020 --> 09:51.885
He wasn't even protesting.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.083
He just came down to see me.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.849
I_ was the true
believer, not Tyler.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.824
He proposed to you?
Yes. A month earlier.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.794
We were hoping to get
married in August.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.764
WILL:
And this was the last
time you saw him?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.825
(shouting)
Yes.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.799
I... Ijust wanted to
hold him one last time.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.205
(sniffles)

10:13.180 --> 10:15.637
Nothing further, Your Honor.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.046
WOMAN:
Oh, God.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.149
Mr. Deerfield, any questions?

10:19.180 --> 10:20.772
No questions, Your Honor.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.708
(whispering):
Where's John?
JUDGE TEMPLE:
Thank you.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.342
(whispering):
He got laid off.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.119
TEMPLE:
Ms. Schweikert,
you are excused.

10:26.150 --> 10:29.085
And, uh, why don't
we reconvene

10:29.120 --> 10:30.883
tomorrow at 9:00?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.283
I have my Harvard

10:32.330 --> 10:34.821
Alumni Association meeting,
and I'm sure you all...

10:34.860 --> 10:37.397
Attorneys, please
approach the bench.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.694
Ms. Schweikert,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.765
may I have you remain
on the witness stand?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.267
I'm sure you're all familiar

10:45.310 --> 10:47.278
with Illinois
Supreme Court Rule 243,

10:47.310 --> 10:48.800
which took effect last July.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.773
Refresh my memory.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.812
Well, we haven't had a chance
to exercise it until now.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.943
"The court may permit jurors
in civil cases

10:57.990 --> 11:01.312
to submit written questions
directed at witnesses."

11:01.360 --> 11:04.022
I received just such a question
now from the jury.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.085
Now, the rule
requires that I ask

11:06.130 --> 11:07.688
if you have any
objections...

11:07.730 --> 11:08.992
I do, Your Honor.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.463
I've designed my case
to lead the jury

11:10.500 --> 11:12.058
to a certain conclusion.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.739
If we start allowing them to
take us on flights of fancy...

11:14.770 --> 11:16.237
Well, I am inclined to overrule,

11:16.270 --> 11:17.931
Mr. Deerfield.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.074
As my civil procedure professor
at Harvard used to say,

11:20.110 --> 11:21.839
"You can never have
too many knights

11:21.880 --> 11:23.472
in the quest for justice."

11:23.510 --> 11:25.273
Step back, please.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.868
What do you think?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.273
Might be good.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.811
It'll give us insight
into the jury's thinking.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.954
TEMPLE:
Ms. Schweikert, we have
one additional question,

11:33.990 --> 11:35.014
and this one is from the jury.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.755
Are you ready?

11:36.790 --> 11:37.722
SCHWEIKERT:
I am, Sll‘.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.955
"Why weren't you wearing
your engagement ring

11:40.000 --> 11:42.298
on the day
of the protest?"

11:42.330 --> 11:43.820
Excuse me, Your Honor.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.064
I'm very happy

11:45.100 --> 11:46.863
that the jury is participating--

11:46.900 --> 11:48.197
uh, we welcome that--

11:48.240 --> 11:50.231
but I believe this question
brings up

11:50.270 --> 11:51.339
facts not in evidence.

11:51.370 --> 11:52.507
TEMPLE:
Yes, I thought so, too,

11:52.540 --> 11:55.475
but there's
a parenthetical here:

11:55.510 --> 11:58.877
"My question is based
on the two photos."

11:58.910 --> 12:00.218
I think the juror
is commenting

12:00.250 --> 12:02.218
on the ring there...

12:02.250 --> 12:04.787
and not there,

12:04.820 --> 12:07.288
and the fact_Ms._ Schweikert
is wearing it now.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.412
So I'll overrule
that objection.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.759
Ms. Schweikert, do you need me
to repeat the question?

12:11.790 --> 12:13.291
SCHWEIKERT:
No, Your Honor.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.752
I...

12:16.530 --> 12:18.395
I don't know.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.136
Permission to redirect,
Your Honor?

12:20.170 --> 12:21.194
Granted.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.764
Brianna, isn't it true
that you simply

12:22.810 --> 12:25.005
left your ring at home that day
so as not to risk it

12:25.040 --> 12:26.769
getting stolen?
Objection.
Leading the witness.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.402
And poorly, at that.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.771
TEMPLE:
Sustained.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.846
Sorry, Your Honor.
I'll rephrase.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.916
Brianna, do you remember

12:33.950 --> 12:37.147
why you didn't wear
your ring that day?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.886
Yes, because I was afraid
it might get stolen

12:39.920 --> 12:42.411
or lost.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.087
Thank you.
No further questions.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.188
WILL:
What the hell was that?

12:45.230 --> 12:47.357
I've suddenly got
Columbo on the jury?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.426
Kalinda, where are you?
We've got a problem.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.401
ALICIA:
So you broke off
the engagement?

13:06.450 --> 13:07.474
At the protest?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.318
I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.942
I-I should have told you,

13:11.990 --> 13:13.389
but I-I thought
it would look bad.

13:15.590 --> 13:16.852
Well, she did it.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.551
She broke it off.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.921
Damn it.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.222
So where does that leave us?

13:21.260 --> 13:23.194
We lost
our sympathy component.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.868
And possibly the sympathy
of the jury.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.936
CLARKE:
And the offer on the table?

13:26.970 --> 13:29.564
I don't think it's
been undercut.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.467
Well, then let's wrap this up
before it is undercut.

13:32.510 --> 13:35.434
Mrs. Florrick,
do you have a minute?
DIANE: Actually, Alicia,

13:35.480 --> 13:36.538
I need a second, too.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.377
I'll be right with you.

13:39.650 --> 13:40.719
DIANE:
You're familiar

13:40.750 --> 13:43.389
with the lease relief portion
of our bankruptcy plan?

13:43.420 --> 13:44.489
Yes.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.112
WILL:
We need you
to present it

13:46.150 --> 13:47.856
to our new landlord.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.448
You want me to do it?

13:49.490 --> 13:51.481
Yes. Do you know Maddie Hayward?

13:51.530 --> 13:53.498
No. I-I mean, by name.

13:53.530 --> 13:54.497
She bought
the building.

13:54.530 --> 13:57.124
She moved half her
semiconductor business here,

13:57.170 --> 13:59.320
and we want you to present our
restructuring proposal to her.

13:59.370 --> 14:00.530
Without you?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.458
DIANE:
Yes.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.161
Just to give it
the personal touch.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.337
Where the hell were you?

14:08.380 --> 14:10.007
Hi, Will.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.041
Five calls. To your cell.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.240
What, you're not
even checking?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.976
Um, I-I've been busy.
What do you need?

14:16.020 --> 14:19.183
I have a rogue juror out there
who seems to know

14:19.220 --> 14:21.188
some background
information on the case.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.187
Which case?

14:22.220 --> 14:25.189
Kalinda, what is going on?

14:25.230 --> 14:26.458
Nothing.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.458
H was gone,

14:28.500 --> 14:30.024
but now I'm back.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.425
The police,
wrongful death suit.

14:32.470 --> 14:35.394
I need you to sit down
with Cary and find out

14:35.440 --> 14:36.930
whether we can excuse
this juror.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.403
Did he or she lie
during voir dire

14:38.440 --> 14:40.237
about knowing our clients?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.168
All right.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.302
Kalinda.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.272
This matters.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.175
We work for
the trustee now,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.017
and I am out
on a limb here.

14:49.050 --> 14:52.087
Okay, look, I'm on it.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.985
(cell phone buzzing)

15:01.160 --> 15:02.923
Yes?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.495
NICK: Tonight,
I'm going to pick you up.

15:17.610 --> 15:21.649
You worked with Allison Saybach
in mergers and acquisitions?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.716
Yes.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.116
How was she?

15:26.150 --> 15:28.050
Great.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.149
Really good. Why?

15:30.190 --> 15:31.521
There were some
ten5ions last year

15:31.560 --> 15:33.721
over the Sweeney
prow fight?

15:33.760 --> 15:37.423
Yes, well, that was just about
who would take the case.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.165
Ah.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.464
We settled that.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.300
Everything turned out great,
and she's very nice.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.036
Hmm. It's an
overpopulated department.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.503
Yes, I know...
I mean, I don't...

15:50.550 --> 15:51.972
I don't know if that's true.

15:52.010 --> 15:55.446
Mrs. Florrick, we're
in an overfull lifeboat.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.744
I have to trim mergers
and acquisitions,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.213
and I'm asking your opinion.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.216
I like Allison Saybach,

16:02.260 --> 16:04.421
and I don't know anyone else
in that department.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.552
Thank you.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.394
What does he want?

16:11.430 --> 16:12.465
I don't know.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.331
There seems to be
a therapy couch

16:14.370 --> 16:15.359
in my office these days.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.492
What's up?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.565
Your new client, the
tow truck magnate...

16:18.610 --> 16:20.578
Yeah, he is coming in
with incorporation papers today.

16:20.610 --> 16:21.372
Could you sit in?

16:21.410 --> 16:22.729
I think he wants
to go over options.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.475
He's my husband.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.447
Huh.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.084
Yeah.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.588
Uh...

16:37.630 --> 16:38.779
I, uh...

16:38.830 --> 16:40.354
Did you send him to us?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.197
No. God, no.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.664
He... Look, he brought
his business here

16:44.700 --> 16:46.190
because I work here.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.391
He's trying to throw
down roots in Chicago.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.635
Uh, I don't want him to.

16:50.670 --> 16:51.762
Was he the voice
on the phone?
No.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.437
That was the man
that works for him.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.505
Is he dangerous,
your husband?
I don't know.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.507
You said he was.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.668
He was, but...

16:59.710 --> 17:02.543
Okay. So I should
drop the case.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.116
You should.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.112
Thanks.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.196
Yep, I'm exhausted,

17:13.230 --> 17:15.221
and it's not even noon.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.454
MAN:
Dr. Joseph Ladera.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.092
I am a licensed medical examiner

17:18.130 --> 17:20.189
with 15 years experience
at the Dayton Crime Lab.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.231
And where did you receive
your doctorate?

17:22.270 --> 17:23.237
Harvard.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.238
TEMPLE:
Really? What year?

17:25.270 --> 17:26.635
1985 to 1989.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.534
1983.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.400
It's good to have
a Harvard man here.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.544
I'm surrounded by
Georgetown philistines.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.241
Welcome.
Thank you.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.577
ALICIA:
Now, the defendant,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.247
Officer Mallen, testified

17:36.280 --> 17:38.214
that he pepper-sprayed
the victim

17:38.250 --> 17:39.717
before turning
to his stun gun.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.286
Why is that problematic?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.823
Pepper spray--
oleoresin capsicum--

17:43.860 --> 17:45.851
can inhibit
a subject's breathing

17:45.890 --> 17:48.290
by causing the throat
to constrict...

17:48.330 --> 17:50.662
Jurors number
three, six and 11

17:50.700 --> 17:53.260
wrote something down
so far, but I can't tell

17:53.300 --> 17:55.495
if it's just notes
or a question.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.689
ALICIA:
So you're already
gasping for breath

17:56.740 --> 17:58.605
when you're hit with
an electric shock

17:58.640 --> 18:01.177
which compromises
your system?

18:01.210 --> 18:02.404
Correct.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.147
It'd be like having the wind
knocked out of you, literally.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.875
And what about
three electrical shocks?

18:06.910 --> 18:08.673
LADERA:
That would compound
the danger exponentially.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.381
ALICIA:
So, Dr. Ladera,

18:10.420 --> 18:12.615
the use of a_ stun
gun three times

18:12.650 --> 18:14.857
after the subject has
already been pepper sprayed,

18:14.890 --> 18:18.223
wouldn't that constitute
excesswe force?

18:18.260 --> 18:19.420
Objection.
I'll withdraw.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.552
Thank you.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.624
MAN:
Willingham Securities.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.595
Used to be the biggest
in the country. Now look.

18:24.630 --> 18:25.665
As you can see, it's ready

18:25.700 --> 18:28.737
for a new tenant whenever
you're ready to move in.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.438
Mrs. Florrick.
Ms. Hayward?

18:32.470 --> 18:34.529
Maddie.
Or, uh, Miss Hayward.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.878
I don't mind
being objectified.

18:36.910 --> 18:39.401
So we're here to_ discuss
renegotiating your firm's lease?

18:39.450 --> 18:42.146
Yes. Like a lot of other
firms these days,

18:42.180 --> 18:43.818
we're having a momentary
cash-flow problem,

18:43.850 --> 18:46.284
and we'll be forced to lose
two of our three floors...

18:46.320 --> 18:48.356
How long have you worked
at Lockhart/Gardner?

18:48.390 --> 18:50.824
How long? Four years.
This is my fourth.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.680
And you like it?
I do.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.669
Do a lot of people ask you

18:58.700 --> 19:00.463
about standing
by your husband?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.730
They do. Oh, they did.
It's died down a bit.

19:02.770 --> 19:03.737
Well, he's running again,

19:03.770 --> 19:06.409
so it seems like they'll
probably start up again.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.668
I think you're right.

19:07.710 --> 19:09.769
Do these questions
make you uncomfortable?

19:09.810 --> 19:11.300
No.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.806
MAN:
Electricity and LT.
are ready to go.

19:12.850 --> 19:14.772
It's all in_ _
move-in condition.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.844
Look at that space...
That's my driver.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.689
I bring him along.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.813
They think he's the buyer.
I get some time alone.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.681
Um, so are you campaigning
with your husband?

19:21.720 --> 19:23.381
Yes.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.182
And you agree with
him politically?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.356
Enough.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.857
I can't find five
people in the world

19:27.900 --> 19:29.197
I agree with politically.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.790
So will you consider
our proposal?

19:31.830 --> 19:33.229
Do you have to head off?

19:33.270 --> 19:34.931
I came right from court.
Lunch break.

19:34.970 --> 19:37.700
Okay, well, um,
leave this with me,

19:37.740 --> 19:38.934
and if I have
any questions..?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.506
My number's right there.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.700
Cell phone number?

19:41.740 --> 19:43.799
Yes.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.803
Bye.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.851
Uh, Dr. Ladera, what
is excited delirium?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.380
A condition that combines

19:57.430 --> 19:59.682
psychomotor agitation
and aggressive behavior.

19:59.730 --> 20:01.755
DEERFIELD:
Such as the
behavior exhibited

20:01.800 --> 20:03.825
by Mr. Beacham that day?

20:03.870 --> 20:07.533
Officer Mallen has testified
that he just wouldn't stay down.

20:07.570 --> 20:08.798
Objection, Your Honor.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.262
Is Mr. Deerfield testifying?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.436
I'll rephrase.

20:11.470 --> 20:15.474
Uh, excited delirium
has been linked

20:15.510 --> 20:16.738
to drug use, hasn't it?

20:16.780 --> 20:18.805
Yes, mainly stimulants,
such as cocaine.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.818
So did you perform
a tox screen on Mr. Beacham

20:20.850 --> 20:22.670
as part of your autopsy?

20:22.720 --> 20:23.687
LADERA:
Yes.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.642
It didn't turn up any evidence
of cocaine use.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.645
But isn't it true that
some amphetamines

20:26.690 --> 20:29.579
are _undetec_table
after as little as five hours?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.929
Objection.
Your Honor, not in evidence.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.894
Mr. Deerfield is trying to
bias the jury by implying

20:33.930 --> 20:36.421
that the victim had
drugs in his system.

20:36.460 --> 20:37.666
TEMPLE:
Sustained.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.691
No further questions.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.267
TEMPLE:
Thank you, Mr. Ladera.
You're excused.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.336
Oops, wait a minute!

20:44.370 --> 20:46.702
It seems we have another
question from the jury.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.901
VVho?
I have no idea.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.373
I-I didn't see them
hand it to the sheriff.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.640
TEMPLE:
And again, I must
thank our jurors

20:53.680 --> 20:56.410
for participating so
actively in the process.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.610
If there are no objections.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.315
So, Dr. Ladera, the
question is this:

21:01.360 --> 21:02.611
"Would antidepressants show up

21:02.660 --> 21:04.685
on the tox screen
you performed?"

21:04.730 --> 21:06.550
_LADERA: That's _an
interesting question.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.989
It'd depend on the type,

21:08.030 --> 21:09.850
but, uh, generally, no.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.390
We did a basic
ten-point analysis.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.829
You'd have to do
an expanded screen

21:12.870 --> 21:15.566
to find evidence of
most antidepressants.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.999
Thank you, Doctor.
You're excused.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.302
DEERFIELD:
Actually, Your Honor,

21:18.340 --> 21:19.830
permission to reexamine.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.373
TEMPLE:
Doctor, we're not
letting you go just yet.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.298
Dr. Ladera,

21:24.350 --> 21:26.841
is it safe to say that
the presence of antidepressants

21:26.880 --> 21:29.849
might indicate that someone
was suffering from depression?

21:29.880 --> 21:30.915
It is safe.

21:30.950 --> 21:34.681
And depression can cause
someone to behave in a...

21:34.720 --> 21:36.415
an agitated,
even an aggressive fashion,

21:36.460 --> 21:38.781
can it_ not?
Under some Circumstances,

21:38.830 --> 21:40.957
I suppose.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.765
Uh, especially if someone

21:46.800 --> 21:47.869
has recently

21:47.900 --> 21:50.403
experienced
a catastrophic event.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.429
Such as, for example,

21:51.470 --> 21:52.960
uh, the breakup
of an engagement.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.898
Objection.
Beyond the scope.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.532
Overruled, but I might be
inclined to sustain

21:56.580 --> 21:57.569
on the grounds of foundation

21:57.610 --> 22:00.374
regarding the
antidepressants.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.843
Hmm, I...

22:02.880 --> 22:05.087
have no objection

22:05.120 --> 22:08.385
at this time
on those grounds, Your Honor.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.628
Then I'll see counsel
in my chambers.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.799
No, no, no, Mr. Gardner,
you're not objecting

22:13.830 --> 22:15.991
on foundational grounds
because there is a foundation.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.021
Your Honor, we've complied
with all discovery requests

22:18.070 --> 22:19.560
from the defense counsel.
Bull.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.398
We requested discovery
on all the medical records.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.000
No one ever told us about
the use of antidepressants.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.132
Because you requested records

22:26.170 --> 22:27.239
from the past
two years.

22:27.270 --> 22:29.977
Mr. Beacham saw a psychiatrist
briefly three years ago.

22:30.010 --> 22:30.977
Your Honor...
This psychiatrist

22:31.010 --> 22:32.568
prescribed antidepressants?
Yes,

22:32.610 --> 22:33.713
but again, we have
no recent record

22:33.750 --> 22:35.877
_ _ of the victim_ _
refilling that prescription.
Your Honor,

22:35.920 --> 22:37.740
this is the triumph
of form over substance.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.882
In the interest
of justice...
Yes, I quite agree.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.888
Mrs. Florrick,
Mr. Gardner,

22:40.920 --> 22:42.956
you will turn over
all of this evidence.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.753
And if I find out
you've withheld anything else,

22:44.790 --> 22:45.825
there will be sanctions.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.423
What?

22:59.070 --> 23:01.709
Where are you
on a settlement?

23:01.740 --> 23:02.900
Well, where are you?

23:02.940 --> 23:05.079
Eight hundred thousand.

23:05.110 --> 23:07.908
Oh, you mean the offer
you turned down?

23:07.950 --> 23:09.110
Mm-hmm.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.947
(laughing)

23:10.990 --> 23:13.857
You got to love
the jury system.

23:25.730 --> 23:28.460
So tell me that again.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.639
Well...

23:30.670 --> 23:33.969
again, we have
reviewed our caseload

23:34.010 --> 23:36.706
and we're a little
overscheduled at the moment.

23:36.740 --> 23:39.800
So, um, we have
suggestions

23:39.850 --> 23:42.011
of other firms
you might try.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.849
Well, you know, I'm ready
to incorporate for the bid.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.084
Yes,

23:47.120 --> 23:49.213
and we're happy to have
contributed to it,

23:49.260 --> 23:51.820
but, um, we're going to
have to back out now.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.021
What am I missing here?

23:55.060 --> 23:57.961
I don't know.
I don't think anything.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.821
(sighs)

24:30.700 --> 24:33.863
Okay.

24:33.900 --> 24:36.869
Mrs. Florrick.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.504
(clicks tongue)

24:54.120 --> 24:55.951
(elevator bell dings)

25:01.660 --> 25:04.060
CARY:
As far as we can tell,

25:04.100 --> 25:06.295
the questions were
written on yellow paper,

25:06.330 --> 25:08.195
and these seven
are the only ones

25:08.240 --> 25:10.561
with yellow legal pads.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.033
The ring question
suggests a woman.

25:13.070 --> 25:14.298
Or someone who knew Brianna.

25:14.340 --> 25:15.898
Did you run the jurors by her?

25:15.940 --> 25:17.237
Yeah, she didn't
recognize anyone.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.168
Checked their backgrounds,

25:19.210 --> 25:20.746
couldn't find any
connection to her.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.270
And the antidepressant question?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.914
Any doctors
or spouses of doctors?

25:24.950 --> 25:26.941
No. Someone
had a paramedic

25:26.990 --> 25:29.959
as a brother-in-law,
butthatsit

25:29.990 --> 25:31.958
So we're nowhere?

25:31.990 --> 25:34.550
Here.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.990
The voir dire form of juror
number five-- Emma Hanahan.

25:38.030 --> 25:39.793
What am I looking at?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.036
Number of children.

25:41.070 --> 25:42.560
She wrote three,
crossed it out

25:42.600 --> 25:43.931
and wrote two.

25:43.970 --> 25:46.029
It's a common error _
when a parent loses a child.

25:46.070 --> 25:48.630
Force of habit.
The antidepressants?

25:48.680 --> 25:49.908
Suggests
that she could have

25:49.940 --> 25:51.942
some personal experience
with depression.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.948
Check it out.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.574
I can't get her excused,
but ifI know it's her,

25:56.620 --> 25:57.882
I can argue to her.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.888
Oh, we're done.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.057
How did it go?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.058
Fine. You?

26:03.090 --> 26:04.751
DIANE:
Alicia, do you have a minute?

26:04.790 --> 26:07.281
Yes.
Later.

26:07.330 --> 26:08.797
Sorry, things are a bit chaotic.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.718
How did it go
with Maddie?

26:10.770 --> 26:11.691
Good-- I think.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.834
She didn't want to talk
about the lease much.

26:13.870 --> 26:16.338
Yes, well, she's a funny one,
but she seemed

26:16.370 --> 26:18.167
open to the proposal?
I think.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.678
I gave her my number
in case you wanted to call.

26:20.710 --> 26:21.938
Why don't you call her?

26:21.980 --> 26:23.379
(knocking)

26:23.410 --> 26:25.844
Sorry. This is awful.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.314
The trustee _ _
let mergers and achISItions go.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.887
What? He let it go?

26:30.920 --> 26:32.979
Yeah, well,
not all of it.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.817
Allison Saybach,
oddly enough.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.919
Not sure what she's
gomg to do on her own.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.991
PETER:
Well, yes, money is...

26:42.030 --> 26:44.089
always a concern,

26:44.130 --> 26:45.961
but we have campaign
finance laws for a reason,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.399
(door opens)
and I'm not going to jeopardize

26:47.430 --> 26:48.533
the campaign...
Psst. Psst.

26:48.570 --> 26:51.835
Peter, I am so sorry.
I have to grab you for a moment.

26:51.870 --> 26:53.872
Bobby, I will bring him
right back. Come on.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.141
Eli, what are you doing?

26:58.180 --> 27:00.205
I don't know what happened.
We were worried about money,

27:00.250 --> 27:01.911
then suddenly...
Suddenly what?

27:01.950 --> 27:03.781
MADDIE:
Hello, Peter.
Miss Hayward,

27:03.820 --> 27:05.947
meet Peter Florrick.
Miss Hayward.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.981
It's so nice to meet you.
I, uh,

27:08.020 --> 27:09.749
only know you
from reading Forbes,

27:09.790 --> 27:12.054
but I've always been a fan.
Thank you.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.058
I think I'm becoming
a fan of yours, as well.

27:14.100 --> 27:14.998
Has Eli been bending your ear?

27:15.030 --> 27:17.396
No, I've just met Eli,
but your wife has.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.660
Alicia?
Yes.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.065
You seem surprised.

27:21.100 --> 27:21.896
No, no, I-I, uh...

27:21.940 --> 27:23.430
I didn't know
you knew each other.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.938
Well, we just met yesterday,
but I am thinking

27:25.970 --> 27:27.801
about contributing
to your campaign.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.330
Really?

27:29.380 --> 27:31.200
I thought you only contributed
to female candidates.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.774
Ido...

27:32.810 --> 27:34.346
mostly support
female candidates,

27:34.380 --> 27:36.416
but, um, I like your wife.

27:37.850 --> 27:39.044
You two are separated?

27:39.090 --> 27:40.409
No.
Yes.

27:40.450 --> 27:41.986
But she's
supporting you?

27:42.020 --> 27:44.079
They're trying
to work things out.
Yes.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.984
By not sleeping
with prostitutes?

27:46.030 --> 27:48.954
If I do support you,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.968
do I have to worry about that--
another prostitute?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.092
Another mistress?

27:52.130 --> 27:54.928
A furtive kiss
on the campaign bus?

27:54.970 --> 27:56.096
No, you don't.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.232
And why is that?

27:57.270 --> 28:00.000
Because I just told you.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.076
Peter's changed.

28:02.110 --> 28:04.476
That's why.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.068
I don't believe
people can change.

28:06.110 --> 28:07.338
You know what?

28:07.380 --> 28:09.143
I didn't, either.

28:09.180 --> 28:11.887
And then, of course,
I went to prison.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.218
WILL:
And you were his therapist?

28:14.260 --> 28:17.218
The deceased,
Tyler Beacham's therapist?

28:17.260 --> 28:18.852
MAN:
Yes, I saw Mr. Beacham

28:18.890 --> 28:20.255
for a short time
about three years ago.

28:20.290 --> 28:21.257
He came to me

28:21.300 --> 28:23.052
suffering from nervousness

28:23.100 --> 28:24.897
and related insomnia.
But not depressmn?

28:24.930 --> 28:27.023
Not the deep depression

28:27.070 --> 28:28.958
from a family tragedy?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.865
That's correct. He'd been
laid off from his job,

28:30.910 --> 28:33.003
which caused _him
some mild anXIety,

28:33.040 --> 28:35.099
but in my opinion, he was
not clinically depressed.

28:35.140 --> 28:38.348
And yet you prescribed him
an SSRI?
Yes,

28:38.380 --> 28:40.041
but not to treat depression.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.048
Certain antidepressants
are also useful

28:42.080 --> 28:44.082
for the treatment of anxiety

28:44.120 --> 28:45.348
and to help
regulate sleep patterns.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.982
Thank you, Doctor.

28:47.020 --> 28:50.057
Dr. Zarovich,
the specific drug

28:50.090 --> 28:53.127
which you chose to prescribe

28:53.160 --> 28:55.458
was called Elvatyl?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.764
ZAROVICH:
Yes, at that time,
Elvatyl seemed

28:57.800 --> 28:59.324
to have the best response rate
for insomnia

28:59.370 --> 29:02.168
and related anxiety.
"At that time?"

29:02.200 --> 29:04.430
You mean you no longer
prescribe Elvatyl?
No, I don't.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.938
Why is that?
Other drugs are
more effective.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.198
Well, isn't it true
that Elvatyl

29:08.240 --> 29:11.141
is known _to have numerous
damaging Side effects?

29:11.180 --> 29:12.875
The science on that is unclear.

29:12.910 --> 29:16.368
Really? Mr. Gardner here won
a lawsuit on just those...

29:16.420 --> 29:17.819
Objection. Relevance.
Admit it, Will.

29:17.850 --> 29:19.283
You won the case
by attacking Elvatyl's

29:19.320 --> 29:20.514
suicidal side effects.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.211
Your Honor, I have an objection.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.249
DEERFIELD:
Uh, Your Honor, Mr. Beacham

29:23.290 --> 29:24.450
taking a drug
that could alter

29:24.490 --> 29:27.186
his brain chemistry
is perfectly relevant.

29:27.230 --> 29:30.427
In fact, there was a study
on Elvatyl's side effects

29:30.460 --> 29:32.792
at, uh, let me see...

29:35.240 --> 29:37.060
Harvard Medical School.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.101
Really?

29:38.140 --> 29:39.539
Do you have it here?

29:39.570 --> 29:41.208
I do, You Honor.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.878
TEMPLE:
I think I'll allow

29:42.910 --> 29:44.241
a little leeway here.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.202
Isn't it possible,
Dr. Zarovich,

29:46.250 --> 29:49.515
that Elvatyl's side effects
were what led you

29:49.550 --> 29:51.211
to stop prescribing it?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.148
That may have been a factor.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.317
So a person takes a drug
designed to combat

29:54.360 --> 29:58.126
depression that instead
intensifies that depression,

29:58.160 --> 30:01.948
leading to suicidal ideation.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.922
Isn't it possible
that such a person

30:03.970 --> 30:06.268
could be driven to commit,

30:06.300 --> 30:09.929
in effect,
"suicide by cop,"

30:09.970 --> 30:11.267
right in front
of a person who's...

30:11.310 --> 30:13.130
Objection, Your Honor,
this is rank speculation.

30:13.170 --> 30:15.877
Sustained. Mr. Deerfield...
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.941
Well, it appears we'll
have a number of questions

30:23.990 --> 30:26.288
from the jury this time.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.999
Shut the door.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.200
(sighs)

30:51.080 --> 30:54.345
I said shut the door.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.841
Where are you going?

31:01.490 --> 31:03.981
You are really
pissing me off.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.869
You're so stupid.

31:30.350 --> 31:33.239
Why do you hurt me?

31:33.290 --> 31:36.009
Shut up.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.223
I love you.

31:43.130 --> 31:46.327
I always will.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.928
Lie back.

32:19.770 --> 32:21.965
Where have you been, baby?

32:26.410 --> 32:29.231
(protesters shouting)

32:36.580 --> 32:39.686
Carl Bayliss, can we talk?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.984
I didn't know
Tyler that well.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.454
Brianna was the one that
was really involved.

32:44.490 --> 32:45.559
Tyler was the last guy

32:45.590 --> 32:47.387
I thought'd get
into it with a cop.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.319
The defense is saying that he
behaved erratically that day,

32:50.360 --> 32:51.327
provoking the cop.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.463
Did you see
anything like that?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.469
No, dude was always
pretty calm.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.400
I couldn't believe
he got stickered.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.332
What's that?

33:01.380 --> 33:03.439
Oh.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.040
Undercover cops
were going around,

33:07.080 --> 33:08.172
sticking these
on your back

33:08.220 --> 33:09.642
if they thought you
were a troublemaker.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.386
They called it
extraction.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.012
They'd come back
later and pull out

33:13.050 --> 33:14.517
all the black-bloc
anarchists.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.415
And you got that
on the day of the protest?

33:17.460 --> 33:20.258
No, I wish I had.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.791
I bought this later.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.663
But Tyler Beacham
got one?

33:24.700 --> 33:27.168
Yeah, on his backpack.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.667
I remember seeing it
when he walked by.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.133
Can I take a picture?

33:31.170 --> 33:33.206
Uh, yeah.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.473
(overlapping shouting)

33:54.430 --> 33:58.218
*

34:12.310 --> 34:14.278
ELI:
Alicia, I really don't know

34:14.320 --> 34:15.446
how to thank you.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.276
For what, Eli?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.185
Maddie Hayward--
getting her on board.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.448
On...? What are
you talking about?

34:19.490 --> 34:21.355
She's supporting Peter's
campaign because of you.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.187
What?
I owe you.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.321
Mrs. Florrick,
do you have a minute?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.499
Sure. Let's go.

34:30.530 --> 34:31.497
CLARKE:
Any thought

34:31.530 --> 34:33.794
to Amy Hampton,

34:33.830 --> 34:38.767
Gus Nathanson
and Bruce Garvin?

34:38.810 --> 34:40.766
In family law?

34:40.810 --> 34:41.799
Mm-hmm.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.479
I like all of them.

34:46.510 --> 34:50.446
That doesn't sound
very... genuine.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.519
I just feel like I have been put

34:54.560 --> 34:56.448
in an uncomfortable position,
Mr. Hayden.

34:56.490 --> 34:58.526
And what position is that?

34:58.560 --> 35:01.449
Arbiter of people's fates.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.320
(sighs)

35:03.360 --> 35:06.295
I am conferring with other
people, Mrs. Florrick.

35:06.330 --> 35:09.299
You're hardly an
arbiter of anything.

35:09.340 --> 35:13.367
Of course,
you're right. I'm sorry.

35:13.410 --> 35:16.299
No, that's okay.

35:16.340 --> 35:17.409
Thanks.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.441
I like them all.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.141
Uh, all three people

35:22.180 --> 35:25.308
that you mentioned--
I like them all.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.750
Good. Thanks.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.851
Alicia, hi.

35:36.900 --> 35:37.958
I'm not stalking
you, I promise.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.161
I had to meet a judge here--
Kate Conroy in probate.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.792
Do you know her?
I don't.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.900
Well, I'm backing her for
Illinois Appellate Court,

35:44.940 --> 35:46.532
uh, but I knew
you had a case,

35:46.570 --> 35:47.730
so, while I was
here, I thought...

35:47.770 --> 35:49.909
Eli told me
you're backing Peter?

35:49.940 --> 35:51.248
Yes.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.804
I don't know what to say.

35:52.850 --> 35:53.703
Thank you.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.479
And I hope you didn't think
that I was...

35:55.520 --> 35:56.475
No, not at all.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.887
No, I was, uh...
I was impressed.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.583
Speaking of which, um, this
is a little bit awkward,

36:03.620 --> 36:05.656
so I'm just
going to say it.

36:05.690 --> 36:08.250
Would you like to have
a drink sometime?

36:10.300 --> 36:13.565
Look, Maddie, I'm flattered,
really, really.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.364
Ijust... I'm married.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.961
Oh, um...

36:20.010 --> 36:21.978
I-I wasn't
hitting on you.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.637
(laughing):
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.739
Well, now it's
really awkward.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.668
Oh, God, sorry,
I just misunderstood,

36:27.710 --> 36:29.746
and this day-- it's just been
one thing after another.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.872
Yes, don't
worry about it.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.582
I just-- look...

36:35.620 --> 36:38.919
Well, the thing is, I don't
have many friends, Alicia.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.723
There, I said it.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.297
Uh, sometimes
it's hard, um,

36:43.330 --> 36:45.321
to know if someone
wants to be your friend

36:45.370 --> 36:47.258
or if they want
something from you.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.268
I can imagine.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.236
So, um... I'm going
to say it again.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.431
Would you like to have
a drink sometime?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.675
(laughs)

36:57.710 --> 36:59.473
What's so funny?

36:59.510 --> 37:01.546
I just don't remember
the last time

37:01.580 --> 37:03.878
someone just approached me
for a drink,

37:03.920 --> 37:05.319
and I would be
delighted.

37:05.350 --> 37:06.317
How's that?

37:06.350 --> 37:08.409
Good. Good.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.382
We're talking like
normal human beings.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.387
(laughs)

37:11.430 --> 37:12.681
Uh, how about
tomorrow night?

37:12.730 --> 37:13.685
Sounds good.

37:13.730 --> 37:14.924
Looking forward.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.949
WILL:
So,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.025
Officer,
the protest that day--

37:18.060 --> 37:20.563
that was your first
riot squad duty, wasn't it?

37:20.600 --> 37:23.296
Well, we don't actually
call it the riot squad.

37:23.340 --> 37:26.309
I was assigned out of the 27th
district, patrol division.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.501
But it was your first time
doing crowd control

37:28.540 --> 37:29.609
at a large-scale
confrontational event?

37:29.640 --> 37:32.370
Yes. _
Your adrenaline
was pumping?

37:32.410 --> 37:33.206
I guess so.
So tell me

37:33.250 --> 37:34.410
about the stickers,
the red stickers.

37:34.450 --> 37:35.576
LIONEL:
Objection, Your Honor.

37:35.620 --> 37:36.473
Foundaﬂon.
Your Honor, undercover
police officers

37:36.520 --> 37:38.647
put red stickers
on troublesome protesters

37:38.690 --> 37:40.612
they deem worthy
of extraction

37:40.650 --> 37:42.618
from the more
peaceful protesters.
Your Honor,

37:42.660 --> 37:44.321
you can't just feed
the foundation into the record.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.420
Which is why I'm asking
the question of Officer Mallen.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.620
Overruled.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.719
So, Officer Mallen,
you saw a red sticker

37:50.760 --> 37:52.728
on Tyler Beacham's backpack,
didn't you?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.431
No.
You didn't see this?

37:54.470 --> 37:56.734
That's you right there in the
video, and you didn't see it?

37:56.770 --> 37:58.658
The red sticker
right there.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.507
I didn't see it.
But you see it now?

38:00.540 --> 38:03.077
No.

38:03.110 --> 38:05.408
You don't see it
now in this still?

38:05.450 --> 38:06.974
No.
(clears throat)

38:09.080 --> 38:11.446
Oh, you mean
on the screen there?

38:11.490 --> 38:12.980
Yeah, yeah,

38:13.020 --> 38:14.749
H see that.
Good.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.509
Maybe Mr. Deerfield can clear
his throat twice for yes.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.652
(scattered laughter)

38:18.690 --> 38:20.829
Unfortunately, what Mr.
Beacham had on his backpack

38:20.860 --> 38:22.623
wasn't a red sticker.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.093
It was a happy-face button.

38:24.130 --> 38:25.358
You see that there?

38:25.400 --> 38:26.799
You see the smile?

38:26.830 --> 38:28.092
Yeah, H can see that.
Good.

38:28.130 --> 38:30.633
Now let's fast-forward a bit.

38:30.670 --> 38:31.762
After you
pepper-sprayed Tyler

38:31.810 --> 38:36.372
and sent 1,400 volts through
his body and after he died,

38:36.410 --> 38:37.707
there, look.

38:37.740 --> 38:39.503
What's missing
from his backpack?

38:39.550 --> 38:41.472
What isn't
there anymore?

38:41.520 --> 38:42.475
I understand

38:42.520 --> 38:43.509
why you don't want
to answer.

38:43.550 --> 38:44.778
The button isn't
there anymore.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.913
Because you removed it?
LIONEL:
Objection-- argumentative.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.349
I'm merely asking
the question.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.755
You are not.
You removed
the red button

38:49.790 --> 38:50.814
because you made
a mistake and you

38:50.860 --> 38:51.849
were trying
to cover your tracks.

38:51.890 --> 38:52.857
Objection.
Isn't that correct?

38:52.890 --> 38:53.982
Sustained.

38:54.030 --> 38:55.497
He charged at me.

38:55.530 --> 38:57.395
What does it matter
about the sticker?

38:57.430 --> 38:58.567
Who _cares whether
it's gone?

38:58.600 --> 38:59.828
It was there before.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.462
But you said
you didn't see it before.

39:03.070 --> 39:04.662
Your Honor,
this line of questioning

39:04.710 --> 39:06.109
should be excluded
from the record.

39:06.140 --> 39:08.062
No, it shouldn't,
Mr. Deerfield, no.

39:08.110 --> 39:10.078
Thank you, Your Honor.
No further questions.

39:19.850 --> 39:20.817
Mrs. Florrick.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.112
Mr. Hayden, hi.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.252
I saw you dropped a client--

39:23.290 --> 39:26.487
Nick Saverese, his government
contract, tow trucks.

39:26.530 --> 39:30.990
Yes, um, I think the case
had some irregularities.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.497
What irregularities?

39:32.530 --> 39:34.498
Mr. Saverese is trying
to skirt the requirements

39:34.540 --> 39:35.632
of the law.
Mrs. Florrick,

39:35.670 --> 39:37.558
this firm is
in dire straits

39:37.600 --> 39:39.602
and we need all the
busmess we can get,

39:39.640 --> 39:41.107
so tell him you
made a mistake

39:41.140 --> 39:42.903
and the_ firm _is
retaining his busmess.
Mr. Hayden,

39:42.940 --> 39:45.500
I'm not sure
that's advisable.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.676
Thank you.

39:46.710 --> 39:47.904
Tell him you
made a mistake

39:47.950 --> 39:50.077
and the_ firm _is
retaining his busmess.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.681
Yes?

39:57.720 --> 40:00.928
I talked to Maddie Hayward.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.928
She isn't going to renegotiate.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.690
She has other tenants
who want to expand

40:05.730 --> 40:08.164
and she's worried
about the precedent.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.098
I'm sorry.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.539
But she is giving

40:10.570 --> 40:12.959
to your husband's campaign.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.136
I know.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.808
I'm... stunned.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.171
You have no idea
how this happened?

40:22.220 --> 40:23.539
That she's giving
to Peter's campaign?

40:23.580 --> 40:25.218
No.

40:25.250 --> 40:29.050
I talked to her
about bankruptcy.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.614
She asked me about Peter.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.651
I never solicited her.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.129
We're going to have to lose
the 27th floor now.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.855
I'm so sorry.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.128
Deerfield wants to talk.
DIANE:
Good.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.125
Go bring it home.

40:40.170 --> 40:41.728
We need it.

40:41.770 --> 40:42.896
2.5.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.532
More, Lionel,
or I can call

40:44.570 --> 40:46.128
Officer Mallen's partner
to talk about...

40:46.170 --> 40:48.502
what did he say he wanted
to do at the protest?

40:48.540 --> 40:50.178
_ Make a mark?
Right, make a mark.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.098
I'm sure the jury will
have questions about that.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.902
(sighs)
$3 million.

40:55.180 --> 40:57.512
BAILIFF:
All rise.
Fine, 3.5.

40:57.550 --> 40:59.211
The Honorable Judge
Bernard Temple presiding.
Mr. Gardner,

40:59.250 --> 41:01.013
are we ready to begin?

41:01.050 --> 41:03.484
Your Honor, I believe
we have a settlement.

41:13.530 --> 41:15.498
ELI:
Great reaction
to the speech,

41:15.540 --> 41:17.997
and more importantly,
the fund-raising pledges,

41:18.040 --> 41:21.498
and that is even before a
Maddie Hayward endorsement.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.179
Eli.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.144
You're doing a great job.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.147
(laughs)

41:27.180 --> 41:29.171
You are road drunk.

41:31.050 --> 41:34.213
Well, I should thank you.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.253
What for?
Talking to Maddie about me.

41:37.290 --> 41:38.882
We didn't even know
she was in play.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.022
I don't even know what I did.

41:40.060 --> 41:43.826
Well, the key is, whatever
you did, you did it well.

41:43.860 --> 41:46.761
Where we headed?

41:46.800 --> 41:49.030
Where we heading, Eli?

41:49.070 --> 41:51.607
Home, but we could do
one more meet and greet

41:51.640 --> 41:53.039
if we were
to turn back and...

41:53.070 --> 41:54.162
No...
No...

41:54.210 --> 41:57.031
(both laugh)

41:57.080 --> 41:58.547
What are you two
laughing at?

41:58.580 --> 42:00.309
You, Eli.

42:00.350 --> 42:02.045
We're laughing at you.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.843
That's right.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.587
King Lear's fool--
that's me.

42:06.620 --> 42:09.589
* On that midnight train
to Georgia *

42:09.620 --> 42:12.726
* Leavin' _
on the midnight train *

42:14.730 --> 42:17.597
* Said he's goin' back to find

42:17.630 --> 42:19.666
* Goin' back to find *

42:19.700 --> 42:21.167
* A simpler place in time

42:21.200 --> 42:24.704
* I'm gonna be right by
your side... *
