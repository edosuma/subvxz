I think

00:36.600 --> 00:40.033
somebody's going to be
very happy this year, Raven.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.400
Wait a minute, did you
just have a vision?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.233
I hope you didn't
see what we got you.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.767
Of course I didn't.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.200
I mean, no, I didn't.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.100

You better go on

01:20.867 --> 01:22.000
Are you okay?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.600
Do you need me
to stay with you?

01:24.600 --> 01:26.700
( weakly ):
Oh, Mama, no.

Go... enjoy...

I shouldn't have opened my
present before Christmas

but look at this.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.133
Rae, everyone does that.

02:33.133 --> 02:36.600
It's just... I can't
believe you wore
it to school.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.100
I couldn't help it.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.300
Girl, the outfit demanded
I wear it.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.900
Listen...

02:42.900 --> 02:45.300
listen, I'll have it back
under the tree

02:45.300 --> 02:47.100
and my parents will never know

02:47.100 --> 02:48.600
'cause... isn't it beautiful?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.800
It's jewelry--

02:49.800 --> 02:52.367
I'm a guy, which adds up
to I don't care.

02:52.367 --> 02:53.667
Oh.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.700
Hey, Rae, can I try it on?

02:55.700 --> 02:56.767
I don't know...

02:56.767 --> 02:57.767
Come on, Rae.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.300
Please, please.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.700
Okay, okay, okay.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.567
We better get
to Petracelli's class.

03:03.567 --> 03:04.767
Here he comes.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.400
( loud cracking )

03:07.400 --> 03:10.300
That guy creeps me out.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.367
It's like... it's like
he's looking right through you.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.567
I know what
you mean.

03:14.567 --> 03:17.033
I call him the mid-terminator.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.800
But never to his face.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.700
Uh, Ms. Peterson,
pick up your trash.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.400
Mr. Thomas, pick up you pants.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.367
All right, all right,
all right, one last thing--

03:34.367 --> 03:36.367
I'm sure you'll be
disappointed to know

03:36.367 --> 03:37.834
that I won't be here tomorrow.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.800
ALL:
Aw.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.667
But, Ms. Simmons will be
substituting.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.367
You know, the one
who plays movies

03:43.367 --> 03:45.700
'cause she doesn't care
about your education.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.000
Yay!

03:47.000 --> 03:48.467
( bell ringing )

03:48.467 --> 03:50.100
Now, remember...

03:50.100 --> 03:54.467
even though I'm gone tomorrow,
I will be watching.

03:57.467 --> 03:59.500
All right, girl, time's up.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.400
My necklace misses me.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.500
All right.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.400
Ooh, Rae, it's stuck.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.500
What?

04:07.500 --> 04:08.667
Girl, Mama's coming.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.200

Eddie, be careful.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.400

Eddie, you're hurting...!

04:20.867 --> 04:22.500

Oh, my necklace!

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500
Don't worry,
I see it.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.500

04:24.500 --> 04:25.567

have it in stock?

05:35.200 --> 05:38.967
Well, check again and again
and again.

05:38.967 --> 05:40.967
They're checking.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.800
You do?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.300
Oh, that is
so terrific.

to hold it till 2:00 tomorrow.

05:49.934 --> 05:50.934
2:00? That's no good.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.000
We'll still be
in school.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.400

05:53.400 --> 05:55.967
I think it's time
y'all let a man
handle this.

05:55.967 --> 05:58.700
Look, ma'am, I'm sorry,
but 2:00 is unacceptable.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.667
Now I want the necklace wrapped,
purple bow, ready to go

06:01.667 --> 06:03.000
by 4:00 sharp.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.367
Excellent.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.000
We've got till 1:00.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.967
Forget it.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.834
By the time we get
out of school

06:11.834 --> 06:13.233
it'll be gone.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, you
know, Rae

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
you're just going to have
to tell your parents the truth.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.834
You know, tell them that
you opened your present early

06:20.834 --> 06:23.734
then wore it to school and then
fed it to the lawn mower.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.967
You know, just leave me out
of that last part.

06:25.967 --> 06:30.000
Thanks, Chelsea, but I think
I actually have a good idea.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.667
See, we are going to ditch
Petracelli's class tomorrow

06:33.667 --> 06:35.100
and go to the mall.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.133
We?

06:38.133 --> 06:39.600
Ms. Simmons is substituting.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.967
She never takes attendance.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.033
It's perfect.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.033
Very true--

06:43.033 --> 06:44.100
all except for "we."

06:44.100 --> 06:45.100
Exactly.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.934
We are not cutting class.

06:47.934 --> 06:48.967
Right.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.033
Okay, you know what?

06:50.033 --> 06:51.400
I'm not ditching by myself.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.200
So I guess that means

06:53.200 --> 06:56.500
I just have to tell
my parents, right?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.200
It'll probably ruin
their Christmas.

06:59.734 --> 07:02.000
But I screwed up.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.033
So, uh... I might as well
get it over with.

07:12.133 --> 07:15.300
You know, this is
our fault, too.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.000
I mean, I just
had to wear the
necklace, and...

07:19.000 --> 07:21.900
you know, you threw it
out the window.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.967
Yeah, but can't we just be
really, really sorry?

07:25.967 --> 07:29.400
Eddie, we have to help her.

07:32.133 --> 07:36.100
Usually you guys
are a lot faster.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.100
I found this

07:40.100 --> 07:41.500
hanging up in my closet.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.667
I will not wear this stupid suit

07:43.667 --> 07:46.200
for another stupid
picture with Santa.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
I'm too old.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.967
Come on, we do
this every year

07:48.967 --> 07:50.233
and your mother
loves it.

07:51.567 --> 07:55.200
But... between the two of us

07:55.200 --> 07:57.500
how about ten bucks

07:57.500 --> 07:59.300
to get you to go
along with the program?

07:59.300 --> 08:00.367
Ten bucks?

08:00.367 --> 08:02.600
Hmm... what's
the magic word?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.767
Cheese.

08:11.567 --> 08:12.700
Oh, Good.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.567
I see you found
your Christmas outfit.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.300
That photo means
a lot to your dad.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.834
Really?

08:18.934 --> 08:21.667
I don't know-- it's so dorky.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.934
Well, um...

08:26.233 --> 08:29.967
Would ten dollars make it
any less dorky?

08:29.967 --> 08:34.467
I guess I can do it

the necklace?

11:27.600 --> 11:30.567

to get back to school.

11:30.567 --> 11:31.667
Oh, look, a shoe sale.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.100
No way!

11:33.100 --> 11:35.233

and get out.

11:35.233 --> 11:36.934

so let's get out.

11:36.934 --> 11:39.600

Let's take a picture
with Santa.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.734
It'll be a souvenir
of the day we cut.

11:44.734 --> 11:48.133
Merry Christmas,
little girl.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.667
Ho, ho, ho.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.500
A merry Christmas.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.700
Merry Christmas!

11:56.700 --> 11:59.700
( loud cracking )

11:59.700 --> 12:01.667
Did you hear that?

12:01.667 --> 12:03.934
Yeah. Why does it sound
so familiar?

12:03.934 --> 12:06.300
( cracking )

12:06.300 --> 12:08.700
Petracelli.
Petracelli.
Petracelli.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.400
( all gasp )

12:17.767 --> 12:19.800
Merry Christmas!

12:19.800 --> 12:22.900
Thank you, Santa.
Thank you.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.734
Merry Christmas.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.967
Right back at you,
Mr. Petracelli.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.700
Real smooth.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.734
How do you know my name?

12:30.734 --> 12:34.600
Oh, it's a really funny story,
but we can't tell you now

12:34.600 --> 12:36.000
'cause we got to run!

12:42.400 --> 12:44.100
( exasperated yell )

12:44.100 --> 12:45.867
Out of the way!

12:45.867 --> 12:47.500
Mall rats!

12:47.500 --> 12:51.867
RAVEN, CHELSEA, EDDIE:
♪ O holy night ♪

12:51.867 --> 12:55.500
♪ The stars
are brightly shining ♪

12:55.500 --> 13:01.033
♪ It is the night
of our dear Savior's... ♪

13:04.667 --> 13:06.133
Man, I just don't get it.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.567
Why is Petracelli
dressed like Santa?

13:08.567 --> 13:10.133
Well, you guys, you know,
it is Christmas

13:10.133 --> 13:12.834
and I really think
Christmas brings out

13:12.834 --> 13:13.900
the best in all of us--

13:13.900 --> 13:15.834
even, dare I say,
Mr. Petracelli.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.834
Freeze, mall rats!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.734
Ho, ho, hold it!

13:47.934 --> 13:49.300
You are going
to love it.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.000
The perfect gift
for the perfect size eight.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.500
Size six.

13:53.500 --> 13:58.000
Your sister's going
to love it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.967
What are you doing?

13:59.967 --> 14:00.934
Girl, you're not trying

14:00.934 --> 14:02.367
to sneak a peak
at your presents, are you?

14:04.900 --> 14:07.200
Me?

14:07.200 --> 14:13.000
And spoil the wonderful surprise
that is Christmas morning?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.200
Shame on you.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.867
This thing is too tight.

14:25.867 --> 14:28.000
Now I know why
those people yodel.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I think it's adorable.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, at least your mother
didn't make you wear

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
the matching stockings.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I almost forgot.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.700
I left them
in the kitchen.

14:37.700 --> 14:38.767
Thanks, honey.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.400
Okay...

14:43.400 --> 14:46.300
How about five bucks?

14:46.300 --> 14:49.100
Sure, if it's five bucks a leg.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.033
So, you ready to go
to the mall with us?

14:52.033 --> 14:53.100
Mall... the mall.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.500
Um, you know, Mom,
I think I'm going to skip it.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.100
I'm kind of malled out.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.400
We do this every year.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.567
We have hot chocolate.
We go shopping.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.100
I pick out something I like.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.900
You tell your father
to get it for me.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.900
He gets the wrong thing.
I have to return it.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.033
I pout a little

15:08.033 --> 15:10.000
then I get to spend more
than he ever would have.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.300
It's tradition.

15:11.300 --> 15:16.300
Yeah, Mom, but, you know,
it's been a long day.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.100
Right. Okay.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.133
PETRACELLI:
Ho, ho, ho,
what have we here?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.600
And yet, Mom

15:34.600 --> 15:38.000
you can never have
too much mall time, truly

15:38.000 --> 15:39.767
so I'll be right there.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.100
That's my girl!

15:42.100 --> 15:43.100
All right.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.400
( dialing )

15:48.400 --> 15:50.934
Chelsea, Eddie,
it's Raven.

15:50.934 --> 15:53.300
You know that picture
we took at the mall with Santa?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.200
Oh, yeah.
I wonder how
that turned out.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.600
Girl, it turned out fine

15:56.600 --> 15:59.367
'cause I just saw it
in the hands of Petracelli!

16:08.934 --> 16:10.300
This is taking forever.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.367
Hey, now we're moving.

16:13.367 --> 16:14.667
Hey, not so fast.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.133
I'm a walking wedgie.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.900
Hey, look who's here.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.133
It's my friends
Eddie and Chelsea.

16:23.133 --> 16:25.133
What a complete
and total surprise.

16:25.133 --> 16:28.734
( stiffly ):
Yes, isn't this a coincidence,
Chelsea?

16:28.734 --> 16:30.500
I'll say, Eddie.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.200
So, Mom, Dad,
little brother

16:33.200 --> 16:37.200
we're going to go shop now,
in the mall... which is here.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.400
Okay, bye.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.800
At least she was with us
for a little while.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.300
Perfect.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.233
The picture's right between
my parents and Mr. Petracelli.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.400
No, wait.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.200
Petracelli's going on a break.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.233
You better go get
those pictures.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.734
How's she going to sneak
by her parents?

16:59.300 --> 17:02.834
Who needs to sneak
when you can walk on by?

17:08.233 --> 17:12.033
No wonder it takes eight
reindeer to pull this dude.

17:12.033 --> 17:14.567
All right.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.867
I'm going in.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.300
Ho, ho, ho!

17:19.300 --> 17:21.600
Merry Christmas!

17:21.600 --> 17:24.834
( all cheering )

17:24.834 --> 17:26.767
Hold on, children.

17:26.767 --> 17:27.767
You waited a year.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.400
You can wait five more minutes.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.300
Santa's not back yet.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.900
Ho, ho, ho!

17:32.900 --> 17:35.200
Santa's just going to look
at the pictures

17:35.200 --> 17:36.934
to see who's been naughty
or nice.

17:36.934 --> 17:41.867
Ooh, these children
have definitely been naughty.

17:41.867 --> 17:44.767
All right, everybody.
Ho, ho, ho!

17:44.767 --> 17:46.500
Yo, yo,
what's the deal?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.100
We've been waiting a long time.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.600
Keep your paws
off the Claus, man.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.000
Ho, ho, ho.
You've been a good child!

17:55.000 --> 17:56.400
Merry Christmas!

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
( yodels )

17:58.700 --> 18:01.233
Are you happy now?

18:07.500 --> 18:10.767
Ho, ho, ho.
What have we here?

18:10.767 --> 18:13.400
Are you some kind of impostor?

18:13.400 --> 18:17.967
Security, there's a phony Santa
running around this mall.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.400
He looks like me...

18:19.400 --> 18:22.734
Ms. Baxter, this was taken
this afternoon, wasn't it?

18:25.467 --> 18:27.300
Okay.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.500
I cut school,
but I had a good reason.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.600
See, my parents got me
this beautiful necklace

18:31.600 --> 18:34.500
for Christmas,
and I opened the present early

18:34.500 --> 18:37.100
I wore it to school
and it got trashed.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.934
So I cut school to replace it
so I wouldn't disappoint them.

18:39.934 --> 18:41.400
I was just thinking
about them.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.667
Totally unselfish.

18:42.667 --> 18:43.734
How did that sound?

18:43.734 --> 18:46.400
Long.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.834
Okay, you know what?

18:47.834 --> 18:51.100
Go ahead and do whatever
you're going to do.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.200
All right, I will.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.567
I'm going to let you
off the hook.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.200
What?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.400
Why?

18:59.400 --> 19:00.900
I ruined everybody's Christmas.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.000
How?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.467
They don't know
what you did.

19:03.467 --> 19:06.233
Yes, but because I had
to open my present early

19:06.233 --> 19:08.400
I didn't go caroling
with my parents

19:08.400 --> 19:09.467
which I love

19:09.467 --> 19:10.600
and I didn't get to, you know

19:10.600 --> 19:12.400
make the gingerbread house
with my dad

19:12.400 --> 19:13.967
which I've been doing
since I was little

19:13.967 --> 19:15.033
and I didn't even get

19:15.033 --> 19:16.400
to put the angel

19:16.400 --> 19:19.500
on top of the Christmas tree
with my mom.

19:19.500 --> 19:24.767
And I didn't ruin
anybody's Christmas but my own.

19:24.767 --> 19:28.767
Hmm, kind of miss
all that stuff, don't you?

19:28.767 --> 19:32.100
Yeah.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.000
Why'd I have to open my present?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.567
Being psychic can throw you
sometimes, huh?

19:37.567 --> 19:40.567
Mr. Petracelli, how did you know
I was psychic?

19:40.567 --> 19:44.200
'Cause I'm not Mr. Petracelli.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.667
That's Mr. Petracelli.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.100
( neck cracks )

19:52.967 --> 19:54.600
Wait a minute.

19:54.600 --> 20:00.967
If he's Mr. Petracelli...
then who are you?

20:00.967 --> 20:04.200
Raven, you have the gift
of seeing the future.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.567
Now I'm going to give you
the gift of changing the past.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.667
Are you sure you don't want
to go caroling with us?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.467
Yeah, it's always been
the Baxter Quartet.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.400
Doesn't feel right
going without you.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.734

I think I'm feeling
a lot better.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.300
I'll be right out.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.767
