00:53.386 --> 00:55.388
I'm just going to meet my friends.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.308
Where would you go this late?
Aren't you tired?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.727
He's going to an internet café again, no?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.896
You should help us tidy things up.

01:03.938 --> 01:07.275
I handed out food with you all day.
Why do you expect so much?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.946
It's just once a month, you punk.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.283
If you're not going help us tidy up,
leave the house.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.578
It's been three months
since you were discharged.

01:18.661 --> 01:19.913
You just sit around.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.539
I get it, so stop!

01:21.623 --> 01:24.209
He does nothing all day,
and goes out every night.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.920
Stop looking at the phone.
What good does it do?

01:27.003 --> 01:28.046
Where are you going?

01:28.129 --> 01:29.506
I'm not going anywhere.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.925
I don't want to go with Dad,
I'll stay here.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.593
That little punk.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.178
That's enough.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.806
He makes me so angry.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.059
Who took this kind of picture?

01:49.317 --> 01:50.193
Excuse me.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.488
Did you take a picture of me?

01:55.406 --> 01:57.784
-Me?
-You just took a picture.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.078
Why would I take a picture of you?

02:01.287 --> 02:03.414
Why are you taking pictures
without permission?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.291
Why would I take pictures of you?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.168
Let's see your phone and find out.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.712
How ridiculous. Why would I show you?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.382
Hey, isn't that Bap-soon?

02:14.676 --> 02:16.469
It is Bap-soon.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.055
Let's get off.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.099
Let's get off and check.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.352
<i>I don't remember very well,</i>

02:24.936 --> 02:27.605
<i>but a strange woman</i>
<i>picked a fight with me.</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:30.316
Fine! Let's get off.
I'll confirm it for you.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.359
You think I'm scared?

02:31.609 --> 02:34.571
<i>I saw it as my chance to run off.</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:35.613
Where are you going?

02:41.369 --> 02:42.704
Thank you very much.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.706
Where are you going?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.583
Show me your phone.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.211
Why would I take a stranger's picture?

02:50.378 --> 02:52.213
You are severely delusional.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.508
Then you can show it to me.
I saw you do it.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
You were taking my picture.

02:58.595 --> 03:03.349
I could show you but I don't want to,
because you made me feel bad.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.351
It's obvious that you took the picture.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.477
Delete it now.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.397
Seriously, you are absurd.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.150
Hey. Delete those pictures.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.407
-What was that?
-What's this?

03:38.843 --> 03:39.677
Mom!

03:41.971 --> 03:43.681
Oh! No!

03:43.806 --> 03:46.643
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>because of that woman I didn't know,</i>

03:47.644 --> 03:49.145
<i>I alone survived.</i>

03:49.812 --> 03:51.522
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

03:56.069 --> 03:57.320
<i>On the 49th day...</i>

03:59.113 --> 04:01.741
<i>I just wanted to say my last goodbye.</i>

04:47.787 --> 04:48.997
<i>That was when it happened.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:20.320
Young man! Are you hurt?

05:21.279 --> 05:22.113
Young man!

05:25.074 --> 05:27.076
<i>It was my first time travel.</i>

05:28.077 --> 05:29.704
SEOUL STATION

05:37.337 --> 05:39.797
2015 HAPPY NEW YEAR!

05:43.509 --> 05:44.844
It's very shocking, isn't it?

05:48.973 --> 05:50.016
Aren't you cold?

05:51.309 --> 05:52.143
Jeez.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.104
Why did you come out like this?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.691
You call yourself a time traveler.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.402
Hey, put it on.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.947
<i>That day, I met another time traveler.</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:07.658
Next time you ride that subway,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.828
bring winter and summer clothes.

06:10.995 --> 06:14.415
You can't control where you're going yet.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.584
-Who are you?
-Just put it on.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.960
You'll get a runny nose.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.631
There. How is it?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.426
Have you had time to deal
with the death of your parents?

06:26.719 --> 06:27.887
Who are you?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.932
And where am I?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.351
Who are you?

06:33.851 --> 06:37.355
Why aren't you using honorifics with me?
You are Yu So-joon.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.274
I'm someone who knew you'd be here.

06:41.609 --> 06:45.196
Should I call myself your senior?
Teacher... I like teacher.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.325
Kid, follow me.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.792
<i>He taught me</i>

06:58.334 --> 07:00.586
<i>many rules about this world.</i>

07:02.046 --> 07:03.840
<i>Passing between the accident site</i>

07:04.715 --> 07:06.634
<i>at Namyeong Station and Seoul Station</i>

07:07.093 --> 07:08.803
<i>would allow me to go into the future.</i>

07:10.638 --> 07:13.266
<i>When traveling to the future,</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:15.560
<i>I would go from Namyeong to Seoul Station.</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:19.522
<i>When traveling to the present,</i>
<i>I would go from Seoul Station to Namyeong.</i>

07:19.856 --> 07:21.524
<i>That's how I'd ride the subway.</i>

07:21.899 --> 07:23.484
<i>These were the basics.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:32.952
Run!

07:35.163 --> 07:37.123
<i>If I saw myself in the future,</i>

07:37.665 --> 07:40.209
<i>I would start to disappear.</i>

07:41.878 --> 07:43.504
Hey! Hurry.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.090
I told you not to run into yourself.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.342
You'll really die!

07:48.843 --> 07:49.677
<i>And...</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:52.930
<i>even the moment I would die...</i>

07:54.056 --> 07:55.725
<i>he knew everything.</i>

07:56.392 --> 07:57.477
Hey. Let's go.

07:58.102 --> 08:02.064
You only have three years left.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.502
THREE MONTHS LATER, FUTURE

08:40.811 --> 08:41.646
Realtor?

08:44.732 --> 08:46.859
Oh! You're home already?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.821
You're not supposed to be off work.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.325
You're making it obvious
you're a newlywed.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.665
New-- newlywed?

09:01.791 --> 09:05.169
Stop looking at me like that.
It makes me feel shy.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.424
We-- we're newlyweds?

09:13.886 --> 09:14.720
What?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.306
Does it still seem like a dream?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.684
Oh, well...

09:21.477 --> 09:26.649
Exactly... how long has it been
since we married?

09:29.110 --> 09:32.572
It's been like a dream, so...

09:33.990 --> 09:40.079
Well, it's been two days
since we got back from our honeymoon.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.872
We're total newlyweds.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.712
You have cold sweats.

09:48.462 --> 09:49.422
Don't do that.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.757
You overdid it last night.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.719
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Wait.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.722
You went out dressed like that?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.600
Oh, I ch-- changed.

10:01.058 --> 10:01.892
Why?

10:02.351 --> 10:04.186
I had a reason.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.691
Speaking of which,
shouldn't you put on some clothes?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.694
These are clothes.  It's a bathrobe.

10:12.486 --> 10:16.198
A shower is for morning or night.
You'll get a cold.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.161
-I gotta go!
-Where are you going?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.667
Where are you going?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.755
Do that thing...

10:36.344 --> 10:37.637
Do it for me.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.311
Come on. Do it.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.438
Flower.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.439
<i>Flower?</i>

10:49.523 --> 10:51.233
<i>What is that? The name of a dog?</i>

10:51.567 --> 10:53.361
"I'll be going now, Flower."

10:53.903 --> 10:55.529
You have to say that.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.074
Not Bap-soon, but Flower.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.118
<i>Her nickname? I call her that?</i>

11:01.410 --> 11:02.578
<i>Have I gone crazy?</i>

11:02.912 --> 11:03.871
Flower.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.624
I love it when you call me that.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.926
We shouldn't overdo it with good things.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.226
What's up with him?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.647
PIANO ACADEMY

11:29.730 --> 11:32.942
JUNE 2016, PRESENT

11:39.240 --> 11:43.244
So... he followed me on the street
saying he was interested in me.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.788
He said he fell for me at first sight.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.290
He was touching me like this.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.209
Really?

11:52.253 --> 11:55.840
And we met by chance and had drinks too.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.677
Then it's over.
You shouldn't have had drinks.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.098
You've lived for 31 years
and don't know your fatal flaw?

12:04.181 --> 12:05.015
I know, right?

12:07.601 --> 12:10.020
That's the weird part,
no matter how much I think.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.565
I exposed my terrible drinking habits,

12:12.857 --> 12:15.776
but he showed up in front of my house
as if nothing happened.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.987
Don't lie.
What man in this world would do that?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
It's so weird,
it almost sounds like a lie.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.743
She's so weird.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.661
Still, you said she's pretty.

12:25.870 --> 12:26.954
So what?

12:27.204 --> 12:30.833
You can pass a woman on the street
and say she's pretty.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.460
That's all it is.

12:32.793 --> 12:36.547
She's not just a little weird.
She's like really weird.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.674
She cannot be my type at all.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.218
Suppose we were on an island together.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.554
-I wouldn't touch her.
-Don't lie.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.347
I really mean it.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.308
I wouldn't touch her. Never!

12:47.391 --> 12:49.643
But, you're saying you married her.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
I went home
and saw wedding pictures on the wall.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.859
It wasn't 30 years or three years later,
but three months!

12:59.236 --> 13:00.821
Does that make any sense?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.449
There was never any marriage in my fate.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.410
We weren't even dating.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.746
So, why did you save her to begin with?

13:15.377 --> 13:17.046
I had my reasons for doing that.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.424
Has he totally fallen for me?

13:20.508 --> 13:23.344
-Don't say that anywhere else.
-I'm telling you it's the truth.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.430
I understand you,
but other people will laugh at you.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.517
-It's Realtor.
-It's him?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.937
He has good sense.
Look how he's calling now.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.605
Take it.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.068
Yeah.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.111
<i>I'd like to meet right now.</i>

13:42.238 --> 13:43.656
I'm busy right now.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.367
Meet me even if you're busy.
It's urgent.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.996
Hey, he's totally into you.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.289
No way.

13:52.748 --> 13:53.749
What do you mean?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.335
He wants to meet even after seeing
your drinking habits.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.963
He must be blind or something.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.799
Do you think so? What should I do?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.093
I'm going.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.427
Go on!

14:06.136 --> 14:07.388
Walk straight!

14:08.722 --> 14:10.266
Don't shake your butt!

14:15.020 --> 14:17.731
<i>Is he really into me?</i>

14:19.191 --> 14:22.152
<i>What was I blinded by</i>
<i>that I married this woman?</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:28.826
Say something,
since you asked me to meet.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.621
-The look in your eyes is a bit...
-What's wrong with my eyes?

14:33.247 --> 14:38.210
-You're staring a little too openly.
-This is how I look at people.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.213
Sure, let's just say that you do.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.095
You don't... have a boyfriend, do you?

14:49.179 --> 14:52.182
<i>You want to know about the men in my life?</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:54.476
What if I don't?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.729
Are you not going to have one?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.690
There's no one
you've hooked or are pursuing?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.986
Or any guy
that you've wished you could marry.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.072
Or someone you promised to marry
if you were single after 30.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.242
You don't have anyone
you made those silly promises with?

15:10.534 --> 15:12.161
I don't have much interest in guys.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.080
But why do you ask?

15:15.164 --> 15:19.752
I want to help if there's even one man.
This is just an innocent gesture.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.550
You seem like you'd be in danger
if left alone.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.970
It would be good for you
to have a man to go drinking with.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.139
I must have seemed lonely.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.769
I understand what you mean.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.022
There is no other meaning.
I mean exactly what I'm saying.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.942
Just as a friend of yours.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.234
Since when are we friends?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.528
How can a man and woman be friends?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.405
I don't believe in that.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.658
There's the sister
and brother relationship.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.412
Yes, I will call you Big Sis from now on.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.623
Big Sis!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.043
Oh, it's hot.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.003
So this is how it feels.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.007
So awkward. What do I do?

16:07.174 --> 16:10.636
No, that's not it. Sorry.
We won't do that.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.597
You are really bad at this.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.891
You're more innocent than you seem.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.060
I'm not that clueless.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.562
I know what you're trying to say,

16:21.230 --> 16:22.606
so that's enough for today.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.569
I'll think about it seriously,

16:27.695 --> 16:30.322
so I'd like it
if you didn't push too much.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.534
It's a little bit burdensome for me.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.119
Wait.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.705
Let me tell you my conclusion.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.666
You can't like me, no matter what.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.668
Don't like me in the future, ever.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.047
Okay. I won't like you.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.760
I'm a very busy person.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.556
-Yes?
<i>-Ma-rin. I got us something big.</i>

16:55.639 --> 16:57.307
<i>I came to do a shopping mall shoot.</i>

16:57.433 --> 16:59.810
<i>The photographer didn't show up,</i>
<i>so I suggested you.</i>

16:59.893 --> 17:00.728
Really?

17:02.312 --> 17:03.188
Wow.

17:03.897 --> 17:04.898
Where are you going?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.860
I have to go, the studio is booked
in an hour.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.237
I have to get my camera,
so I have no time.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.072
Realtor, where's your car?

17:12.197 --> 17:13.907
Are you saying I should drive you?

17:13.991 --> 17:16.452
This is how you get points from me. Hurry!

17:17.077 --> 17:18.787
How can you be so shameless?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.205
Is this your car, Realtor?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.251
Actually, this one is.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.551
Why am I even doing this?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.200
Hello!

17:56.408 --> 17:57.993
Why am I helping her with this?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.166
That's good, right?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.461
I'm telling you
in case you get the wrong idea.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.797
I'm only helping you because you insisted.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.632
-Bit-na!
-Ma-rin!

18:11.715 --> 18:14.843
Oh my goodness.
What can I do to thank you?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.970
You helped me, too.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.305
It was nothing.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.223
Who is this?

18:19.681 --> 18:20.724
A new model?

18:21.683 --> 18:23.936
Oh, very good.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.772
Hello, I'm the photographer Song Ma-rin.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.817
He's a friend who helped me.
He isn't in this line of work.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.610
-I'm going.
-Okay.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.694
Just a second.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.910
Our clothes would look great on you.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.706
What do you think?
Would you like to try modeling?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.083
No way!

18:46.333 --> 18:47.709
He's exploding with charisma.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.503
President!

18:50.254 --> 18:53.298
The clothes are like works of art.
They really are.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.342
You really have a great eye.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.389
I will do my best to make them look great.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.267
Get ready.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.186
This is a bad fate.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.606
Whatever the reason is,
I shouldn't get involved.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.818
Ignore any calls from her.
Pretend not to know her.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.529
Ignore any calls from her.
Pretend not to know her.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.490
Ignore any calls from her.
Pretend not to know her.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.121
Chief, there's a gap in the wall.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.291
I told you many times

19:27.374 --> 19:31.879
to follow all the exact numbers
for insulation according to the plan.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.881
I don't see any issues.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.177
Hey! Let go of me.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.639
Don't you see this handspan space here?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.559
This small gap won't cause any problems.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.811
If it's such a problem,

19:47.936 --> 19:50.355
we can reinforce it
when we finish the interior.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.567
You come around and nitpick
every now and then.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.527
Does that mean we do what you say?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.279
Damn it.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.157
They're always treating me like crap.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.367
They look down on me
for being a young woman.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.703
-He's just a bastard.
-Hey.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.750
Anyway, we can't go on like that,
we need a bigger budget.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.754
We're going to spend a lot
due to the fire in Gangwon-do.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.840
Should we build this place haphazardly?
Where people will live?

20:18.133 --> 20:20.344
We'll end up asking So-joon
for money again.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.638
Can you ask this time?

20:23.096 --> 20:26.558
-I'm too ashamed to do it.
-Why did you agree to take on Gangwon-do?

20:27.434 --> 20:29.186
Dad! So-joon is a bank to you?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.439
Gosh, that temper of hers.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.442
Hey, Se-young. Eat before you go.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.861
You did well today.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.822
They say you should build
new relationships.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.284
I wonder if I've made a good relationship
with you today,

20:46.370 --> 20:47.287
What do you think?

20:47.788 --> 20:49.498
Can we do this regularly?

20:50.123 --> 20:50.999
I don't know.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.379
About that friend of yours...
the one that looks like a model.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.090
I wonder if you could bring him by.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.719
He's just a person
running a real estate agency.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.637
Bring him in.

21:04.221 --> 21:09.142
You need to show me that kind of passion
before I build a relationship with you.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.983
She is being kind of petty.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.568
Still, can't you ask him to do it?

21:19.194 --> 21:21.905
If you get a regular job here,
that's a step up for you.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.410
Realtor would do it for me if I asked him.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.829
That's not the problem.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.500
I just feel like
I'm using a person that likes me.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.961
My feelings aren't at that stage yet.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.465
He likes you?

21:42.426 --> 21:45.762
Pretend you don't know.
You may end up seeing him again.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.602
Just go back to her.
Hye-kyung is a nice girl.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.896
It's because you've been together
for so long.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.900
When is So-joon getting here?

21:59.776 --> 22:02.571
Tell him to pay for all of this.
He has too much money.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.365
Is So-joon your financial backer?

22:05.824 --> 22:06.825
Sure, he is.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.661
-You're always with him too.
-Let's order one more.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.830
-Are you drunk?
-I'm not.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.040
Did you drink?

22:13.290 --> 22:14.583
Oh, you're here?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.084
You're here?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.921
Hye-kyung and I broke up,
I'm having a hard time today.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.049
He's like this because of a girl?

22:22.549 --> 22:25.344
You can meet someone else.
Should I set you up?

22:25.969 --> 22:28.180
I was serious about Hye-kyung.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.808
You'll become serious
with another woman too.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.560
You're overreacting. Right?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.730
What would you know about love?

22:38.398 --> 22:39.274
Love?

22:40.442 --> 22:42.861
Is it love that breaks up
when you get bored,

22:43.153 --> 22:44.863
or things get hard?

22:44.946 --> 22:47.491
OK, that's enough.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.242
Sit down over here.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.911
Don't worry about it,

22:51.411 --> 22:52.371
and eat up.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.498
I thought something was wrong.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.594
-What is it?
-Wait. Sit down.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.930
-I'll go talk to him.
-So annoying.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.473
-It's okay.
-Drink up.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.648
Don't leave. I'll buy tonight.

23:19.981 --> 23:20.899
Just use the card.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.110
How will we feel if you leave like this?

23:23.443 --> 23:24.277
Take it.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.992
That punk goes back to Hye-kyung,
they get back together.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.620
Then he leaves her for another woman.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.623
He goes to Canada for work
and meets someone there.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.582
Jeez.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.961
I know this already, so that was silly.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.713
He's acting like it's life or death.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.466
You know, but Sung-min doesn't.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.137
Hye-kyung is all Sung-min has.

23:50.387 --> 23:53.348
He doesn't know they'll get back together,
or about Canada.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.226
He can't even imagine
he would betray her.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.061
Sung-min's having a hard time now.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.150
But, what can I do?
I know everything, so it's a joke to me.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.736
Gosh, I don't know.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.990
I've never had to live like you.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.993
You live in the future and present.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.872
But all we have is now.
That's how everyone in this world lives.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.999
If that seems like a joke,
I'm speechless.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.794
Do you have to live
so focused on the future?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.674
Go. See you tomorrow.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.322
-Good morning.
-Hi.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.324
-Good morning.
-Hello!

25:34.407 --> 25:35.700
-You're here!
-Yes, hello.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.456
<i>Here's the coffee shop's address.</i>

25:42.082 --> 25:43.124
<i>Let's meet at 3:00.</i>

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
I won't get involved.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.630
You get to be a model, thanks to me.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.676
You'll get the same commission
as you would if you rented a studio.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.094
You're grateful?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.437
The president there won't hire me
unless I bring you.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.815
You'll help me, won't you?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.738
It isn't always best to be honest.

26:14.197 --> 26:18.326
If I act too pathetic, I'll look bad.
Then I will get looked down on.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.330
Hey, isn't that Bap-soon?

26:23.873 --> 26:25.166
You're right. It's Bap-soon.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.794
She's old now.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.380
Did you see the article?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.800
I'd be too embarrassed to go out,
if it were me.

26:33.925 --> 26:34.759
Article?

26:34.843 --> 26:35.802
She's quite strong.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.226
WHICH CHILD ACTRESS HAS GROWN UP
A DISAPPOINTMENT?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.313
It's this punk Reporter Choi again?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.274
Damn it.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.450
It's me. Bap-soon, the person you find
to be a disappointment, Reporter Choi.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.786
You wrote an article about me again.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.581
Do you keep an article
ready to be published?

27:05.290 --> 27:08.376
Why are you feeding me new insults
every time I'm about to forget?

27:08.793 --> 27:10.337
I'm about to explode.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.050
I didn't stop acting
because I grew into a disappointment.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.093
I quit because I couldn't act.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.262
You don't even know the facts.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.430
Also,

27:21.348 --> 27:22.932
have you seen my face in person?

27:23.433 --> 27:24.726
Should I send you a selfie?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.395
Why would you choose that picture?

27:27.771 --> 27:29.272
Why would I hang up?

27:31.775 --> 27:34.903
It must be hard
making a living mocking others.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.364
Because of your trashy article,

27:38.156 --> 27:40.158
I hear people talking.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.870
They know I can hear them clearly
saying how sad my life is.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.499
Or blabbing about
how I can dare to go out.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.584
Behaving with no common sense.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.087
Yes.

27:52.504 --> 27:56.424
Your articles are creating
these senseless losers.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.802
Is this why you were born?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.805
Live your entire life this way.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.431
I'll see you in court one day.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.688
What?

28:10.230 --> 28:12.232
If you have something to say,
say it now.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.441
I'll listen to it all.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.276
Seriously?

28:15.360 --> 28:18.029
You can't say it to my face,
only behind my back.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.365
Just write negative comments.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.368
I'll be close
to the cyber investigations department.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.339
Do you know who Bap-soon is?

28:40.135 --> 28:40.969
Why?

28:41.052 --> 28:44.222
Whenever people are about to forget her,
an article pops up.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.349
This...

28:47.058 --> 28:49.018
This is pretty funny.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.899
Bring me any backed up paperwork.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.359
Let me get to work for once.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.320
Hurry. Bring it.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.115
What's with you?

29:05.660 --> 29:08.913
<i>Here's the location of the coffee shop.</i>
<i>Let's meet at 3:00 today.</i>

29:14.627 --> 29:16.087
SONG MA-RIN

29:20.675 --> 29:22.177
She's not still waiting, is she?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.434
Yeah.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.395
I'm sorry.
You must have waited a long time.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.690
Something happened and I had to leave.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.863
I usually have better manners than this.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.992
They say women can get away
with standing a guy up once.

29:46.075 --> 29:50.455
I think that kind of female advantage
is very unfair.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.583
<i>I like equality between men and women.</i>

29:57.837 --> 29:59.088
Why are you silent?

30:00.548 --> 30:02.509
Are you disappointed that I didn't show?

30:04.844 --> 30:07.222
Well, I didn't go,

30:07.889 --> 30:09.974
so there's nothing to be sorry about.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.685
<i>Thanks for saying that.</i>

30:13.478 --> 30:15.188
You're saying it so I don't feel bad.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.943
I think you must have been raised
very well.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.445
You are very considerate.

30:23.780 --> 30:28.368
I... I mean...
I'm telling you that I stood you up too.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.912
Can you just believe what I'm telling you?

30:32.539 --> 30:35.834
I want to jump into that river.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.502
What?

30:40.171 --> 30:42.382
Oh, I'm just kidding.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.134
Thanks to you, I'm laughing.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.137
Why is she doing this?

30:49.389 --> 30:51.391
<i>Today, how should I put it...</i>

30:53.142 --> 30:54.269
I feel lonely.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.772
I'm sorry,
but I feel like being alone.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.440
I feel like seeing the sea, too.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.611
Hello?

31:07.448 --> 31:08.408
He hung up.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.706
Yes, I suppose you would be angry.

31:14.789 --> 31:15.999
You got stood up.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.544
Jeez.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.337
That's not it.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.924
I said I didn't go.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.804
I told you I didn't go.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.265
I didn't go. I did not go!

31:32.348 --> 31:34.434
What is it? What? Are you angry?

31:34.517 --> 31:36.561
Here's all the paperwork.
What's wrong?

31:36.644 --> 31:38.646
I don't feel like working.
I'll explode.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.732
What are you saying?
You need to sign these.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.651
-Hey! You can't just leave.
-Don't wear these things.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.045
Mister, it's me.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.507
Mister, come out a minute.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.510
Mister!

32:12.972 --> 32:14.974
Mister, come out.
I have to talk to you.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.311
Mister!

32:20.438 --> 32:22.690
Stop pretending you're not there,
and come out.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.948
Is he really not home? Gosh, seriously!

32:47.215 --> 32:48.216
<i>I stopped by.</i>

32:49.634 --> 32:52.095
<i>Please call me</i>
<i>as soon as you get this note.</i>

33:00.895 --> 33:04.649
At 9:00 p.m on June 13, 2016,

33:05.650 --> 33:07.151
Yu So-joon came by my place.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.754
SONG MA-RIN

33:46.357 --> 33:48.151
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, my dates.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.653
No! Don't.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.280
Don't step on it.

33:52.488 --> 33:53.656
OK. I'm sorry.

34:07.587 --> 34:08.671
Realtor.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.799
Why are you eating chestnuts
on the street?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.553
These are dates, not chestnuts, you idiot.

34:16.929 --> 34:17.930
D-- dates?

34:20.767 --> 34:21.601
I...

34:21.893 --> 34:24.145
I'm an urban man,
I'm not good with agriculture.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.397
Vegetables, fruits, and fish.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.025
You have no common sense.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.569
Are you a man with no common sense?

34:31.652 --> 34:33.988
Is it common sense
to eat dates on the street?

34:34.238 --> 34:35.948
Who is the one
who keeps following me?

34:36.032 --> 34:38.159
See? You're following me now, too.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.416
You called me saying you were lost.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.169
You said you needed me
to help you get home.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.173
Did you think you're the one
who makes yourself look bad?

34:52.673 --> 34:55.009
This is why people look down on you.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.349
What are you doing? Why aren't you going?

35:06.604 --> 35:08.022
Hey, you...

35:09.148 --> 35:10.399
What... what's wrong?

35:10.775 --> 35:12.735
What did I do?

35:17.824 --> 35:21.244
You know at the studio...

35:21.619 --> 35:23.454
That president who saw you said

35:24.539 --> 35:27.083
she would only hire me if I brought you.

35:29.669 --> 35:34.423
So, I wanted to meet
so that I could ask you.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.178
Honestly, I know how to get home.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.431
I thought I would try asking you...

35:43.474 --> 35:44.934
to be a model.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.273
I'm really embarrassed right now.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.363
If I died like this, people would say:

35:58.281 --> 36:00.992
"Bap-soon had such a sad life."

36:04.829 --> 36:07.665
I'll be made fun of even after I die.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.378
Gosh.

36:14.755 --> 36:18.217
Hey, just think about living well.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.847
What's the point in worrying about dying?

36:37.445 --> 36:38.571
Are you okay?

36:42.116 --> 36:44.869
I made a five-year savings account.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.415
I'm going to save like crazy
for five years.

36:50.082 --> 36:53.252
Then I'm going emigrate to the place
with the fewest Koreans.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.631
Don't bother saving. Spend it all.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.841
You don't know
what will happen in five years.

37:00.927 --> 37:04.096
Am I a mayfly?
Why would I live day to day?

37:04.180 --> 37:06.349
You ought to live like a mayfly.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.602
Do everything you want to do,
eat whatever you want.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.855
Date as many men as possible.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.733
What's the point in living
so precariously?

37:16.651 --> 37:19.904
They say life is shorter than you think.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.113
Ma-rin.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.118
It's my mom.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.454
Who is he?

37:29.121 --> 37:30.706
Just a friend.

37:32.124 --> 37:34.794
Hello. Sorry for coming so late.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.796
Look at you, drinking so late.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.005
Good going.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.841
How can you let her drink so much?

37:41.384 --> 37:43.177
-Sorry?
-What were you doing with her?

37:43.552 --> 37:45.388
-Me?
-What's wrong with you?

37:45.846 --> 37:48.057
What were you doing?
Look how red her face is.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.351
-Get inside.
-Why should I?

37:50.434 --> 37:52.144
-Why did you come out?
-Who is he?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.272
-This is so upsetting.
-Just go in.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.773
His pants are all ripped.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.443
Stop embarrassing me, Mom.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.196
Why...

38:03.281 --> 38:04.115
What...

38:05.074 --> 38:07.576
Why do you keep drinking day and night?

38:07.702 --> 38:10.663
I can tell by his handsome face
that he's no one.

38:10.871 --> 38:12.540
Grow up already!

38:13.040 --> 38:14.542
Why are you even here?

38:14.875 --> 38:18.963
There's another article about you.
You didn't pick up the phone.

38:19.046 --> 38:21.465
My goodness.
You don't even do your laundry.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.217
I came because I'm so upset.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.470
This happens.
Why are you acting like this is new?

38:27.471 --> 38:29.598
Gosh, really... hey.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.685
I want you to go on an arranged date.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.273
I picked up a good one for you.
He's a reporter for Daeseon Daily.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.027
Why would a reporter
from Daeseon Daily meet me?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.778
I hate reporters, too.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.948
Stop acting like you have so much
going for you.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.284
Do what I tell you, now.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.661
I will manage you.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.914
You're getting old now.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.500
With so many bad rumors
and comments online...

38:58.419 --> 39:01.339
Do you know how embarrassed I was today
at the hiking club?

39:01.422 --> 39:02.923
My pride was so hurt.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.053
I'm sorry for being
an embarrassing daughter.

39:08.304 --> 39:11.182
You took me to the station
when I was six years old.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.310
Everyone said it wouldn't work out,
I even said I didn't want to.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.897
It was you who dragged me around
to get me in as an extra.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.023
It was your greed.

39:20.024 --> 39:25.196
I can't even remember now
what led me this way.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.616
But, all right. I'm sorry
I didn't live up to your ambitions.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.205
So, I made you this way?

39:35.289 --> 39:37.500
Leave, Mom. Just leave.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.252
Then you take care of everything alone.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.879
I won't do anything.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.049
You do everything, and live life alone.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.714
Where did you buy this?

40:25.798 --> 40:26.841
Is it a gift for me?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.969
You bought it for me for my birthday.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.684
You put no thought into it.
Did you grab the first thing you saw

40:37.017 --> 40:38.227
without knowing my size?

40:38.436 --> 40:39.353
It doesn't fit?

40:39.437 --> 40:43.065
You said it was amazing and cute
that my feet were size 220 mm.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.443
You don't remember anything I do, do you?

40:45.526 --> 40:47.111
All guys are like that.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.406
Where did you buy it?
I'll go exchange it.

40:51.365 --> 40:53.492
You can't exchange it,
so keep it as a memento.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.619
Shoes aren't only good for wearing.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.872
Why can't I exchange it?
Making a fuss works.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.375
I don't remember where I bought it.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.132
Give me another birthday gift.
A donation to Happiness Construction.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.467
Okay.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.137
The town has a lot of damage
because of the mountain fire.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.723
There are 80 people left
on the streets.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.643
Government support is not enough.
The project's huge, no one's up for it.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.479
Send me the budget report. I'll do it.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.107
Is something wrong with you?

41:25.191 --> 41:27.193
No. It's nothing like that.

41:27.776 --> 41:29.528
I'm sorry, but let's get going.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.071
I have to be somewhere.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.406
You're leaving right away?

41:32.865 --> 41:35.326
Why are you so busy lately?
It's kind of hurtful.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.619
Sorry. Let's go.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.330
Yeah, Bit-na.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.415
I'm running there now.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.417
Wait. You have to wait.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.925
Oh, Ma-rin. You have some skills.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.177
-Where is the Realtor?
-Getting his hair done.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.555
Oh, Song Ma-rin.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.891
You have more passion than I thought.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.143
I heard you brought that model in.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.063
Don't mention it.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.731
I like that about you.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.399
One should be ambitious with work.

42:08.817 --> 42:10.778
What are you doing?
Get ready for the shoot.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.530
-Yes!
-Hurry!

42:12.613 --> 42:13.572
Yes!

42:26.835 --> 42:30.631
-I don't have time. Let's finish this.
-Okay. Thank you so much.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.384
Why didn't you tell me?

42:34.718 --> 42:37.388
This is awkward,
so let's get it over with.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.474
So... what am I supposed to do?

42:41.392 --> 42:44.019
Wait a minute.
Just trust me, Realtor.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.524
-Clothes.
-Yes.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.451
Can you relax your expression?

42:59.868 --> 43:01.370
Oh, okay.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.080
-Relax your body too.
-Okay.

43:05.791 --> 43:09.128
Jeez, I really didn't think much of this,
but this is hard.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.724
ONE SUMMER DAY

43:21.807 --> 43:23.642
You were good for your first time.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.394
You must be a natural.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.354
For real!

43:31.400 --> 43:32.359
We're done!

43:34.695 --> 43:36.238
I didn't say I would drive you.

43:36.780 --> 43:37.656
Can you get out?

43:38.699 --> 43:39.908
Okay.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.622
Oh, look how pretty the sky is.

43:45.247 --> 43:46.582
Look at the sky.

43:56.258 --> 43:58.344
Thanks so much for today.

43:58.927 --> 44:02.640
I didn't think
you would think of me this much.

44:03.682 --> 44:04.808
I was touched.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.438
-I have something to say.
-Okay.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.399
I've never liked you.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.485
What?

44:15.235 --> 44:18.405
If you thought that I did,
you were mistaken.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.534
I tried to be honest and tell you.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.411
You kept misunderstanding.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.498
I thought it would be best to be clear.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.294
I was only joking.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.131
You actually believed it all.

44:36.715 --> 44:40.052
No, I just thought it was so cute
how anxious you were.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.136
I was only joking.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.431
No. I was kidding around.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.517
I'd like it
if we didn't contact each other.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.353
Or run into each other.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.940
Let's end it here.

45:01.198 --> 45:02.825
Can you leave first?

45:07.121 --> 45:07.996
Be well.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.584
I'm not misunderstanding.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.504
I'm just curious.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.050
I can understand everything else.

45:21.093 --> 45:23.429
But, why did you come today?

45:26.265 --> 45:27.558
Why did you help me?

45:27.850 --> 45:30.310
You were pitiful.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.606
I wanted to help you one last time.

45:41.321 --> 45:42.239
Wait.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.829
What's your name?

45:51.206 --> 45:54.710
Now that I think about it,
I never even asked you your name.

45:57.212 --> 46:00.549
Our goodbye is very intense,
considering that.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.677
You're overreacting too.

46:38.295 --> 46:40.339
I won't be meeting Song Ma-rin anymore.

46:41.715 --> 46:44.051
I can change my own future.

46:45.928 --> 46:48.263
But, well...

46:49.139 --> 46:52.768
Dying on the same day at the same time
is an incredible fate.

46:53.602 --> 46:56.814
You should look further into who she is.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.273
What fate?

46:58.816 --> 47:01.318
I'll get involved in her life
if I continue to meet her.

47:02.319 --> 47:05.280
Why would you judge things so quickly?

47:05.364 --> 47:06.490
Enough of that.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.451
You look into my accident some more.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.788
-Like what?
-I have trouble going to my last day.

47:14.289 --> 47:17.167
I don't want to see that sight
with my own eyes either.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.796
It's not like I can do anything
about life or death.

47:22.214 --> 47:24.424
Why are you always asking me for help?

47:24.925 --> 47:26.134
Am I your dad?

47:26.343 --> 47:27.636
It's your life, not mine.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.513
You don't even listen to me.

47:29.596 --> 47:31.181
Am I your servant or something?

47:32.766 --> 47:34.601
Then you shouldn't have told me!

47:35.102 --> 47:37.604
How I live or die,
you shouldn't have said anything.

47:37.938 --> 47:38.814
Am I wrong?

47:39.773 --> 47:40.941
You're right.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.693
Man, it's so hot.

47:42.776 --> 47:47.698
I know. Why are you in a sweater
in the middle of summer?

47:47.781 --> 47:49.533
It's a red one like the red devil.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.243
I went over there once.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.329
You sure are diligent.

47:56.999 --> 47:57.916
Hot, right?

47:59.209 --> 48:00.794
Let's go eat cold noodles.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.004
Should we?

48:04.172 --> 48:06.717
You sure have a bad temper.

48:07.259 --> 48:09.052
-Don't forget your bag.
-Oh yeah.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.554
I'll go get my bag.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.350
You're so forgetful. Let's go.

49:03.231 --> 49:07.486
<i>I truly did not hear from him even once.</i>

49:08.362 --> 49:09.821
<i>A month passed by like that.</i>

49:14.159 --> 49:16.495
How was it
when you studied photography in Bordeaux?

49:19.873 --> 49:21.166
Is that what my mom said?

49:21.541 --> 49:23.460
-That I went to Bordeaux?
-Yes.

49:25.796 --> 49:26.755
I didn't.

49:27.881 --> 49:31.551
I just take pictures
for an internet shopping mall.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.553
And I'm working on my dream.

49:34.805 --> 49:35.931
I'm sorry.

49:36.723 --> 49:38.058
My mom must have lied to you.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.812
I'm sorry she got your hopes up.

49:42.270 --> 49:43.397
Should we leave?

49:43.730 --> 49:45.565
I'm sorry, I'll pay.

49:46.024 --> 49:47.734
Then, I'll pay for the meal.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.904
I thought you wouldn't meet me
because I'm a reporter.

49:51.196 --> 49:53.031
You hate reporters, they come after you.

50:02.958 --> 50:05.210
Hey, Yu So-joon. So-joon.

50:05.293 --> 50:06.545
Put it on.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.380
I said I'm not going.

50:08.463 --> 50:10.340
I gave him money as a wedding gift.

50:10.549 --> 50:13.844
Must I go to Director Kim's wedding
on my precious Sunday?

50:13.927 --> 50:17.055
You said you live every day
like it's Sunday, but Sundays are boring.

50:17.139 --> 50:20.726
Have you gone
to a company dinner or an event?

50:21.268 --> 50:24.521
What would people say if you don't
attend the wedding of an employee?

50:24.938 --> 50:28.066
Why do you keep making
so much sense this morning?

50:28.358 --> 50:32.362
-I don't want to hear it.
-That's why you should wear this.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.322
Director Kim is an easy employee.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.408
-Put in some effort.
-Hey!

50:36.491 --> 50:39.202
There's a person I don't want to see.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.871
Who? Is it someone I don't know?

50:40.954 --> 50:42.873
Who don't I know in your life?

50:42.956 --> 50:46.001
Hey! Why do you... look so good today?

50:47.085 --> 50:48.295
You can go on my behalf!

50:48.378 --> 50:50.464
What are you talking about? Get dressed.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.382
Why are you bothering me?

50:52.466 --> 50:54.760
-Are you really...
-I'm really not going.

50:54.843 --> 50:57.679
-Hurry up!
-No, I'm not going.

51:05.187 --> 51:06.730
My gosh, would you stop crying?

51:06.813 --> 51:10.567
You already got your makeup fixed
so many times.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.903
I'll cry all I want before going in.

51:13.195 --> 51:16.364
If I cry during the wedding,
people will think something's wrong.

51:16.448 --> 51:18.533
-What?
-What's wrong with her?

51:18.617 --> 51:19.618
Seriously.

51:19.701 --> 51:21.036
She was laughing yesterday.

51:21.119 --> 51:22.954
I have a lot of things I held in, okay?

51:23.705 --> 51:26.875
I was thinking I suffered all that time,

51:27.375 --> 51:30.253
in order to succeed today like this.

51:30.378 --> 51:33.298
I'm... I'm just so emotional.

51:34.549 --> 51:36.468
I'm so overwhelmed.

51:39.971 --> 51:41.890
-Should I call an ambulance?
-You should.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.684
You guys haven't been through it.

51:44.768 --> 51:48.313
I've never seen someone cry
over marrying well.

51:48.396 --> 51:50.565
-Tell me about it.
-Stop crying.

51:50.649 --> 51:52.109
Hey, drink this and calm down.

51:55.654 --> 51:57.114
You set the goal to marry up.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.616
You worked 30 years to attain it,

51:59.699 --> 52:01.451
and I acknowledge that.

52:01.785 --> 52:02.619
I'm proud of you.

52:04.037 --> 52:05.705
In the end, you did it.

52:06.748 --> 52:09.084
Thank you for congratulating me.

52:10.335 --> 52:11.711
Yeah. Congratulations.

52:14.756 --> 52:16.591
-Oh my!
-Hey!

52:16.675 --> 52:18.552
-Oh no!
-What do we do?

52:18.635 --> 52:22.013
Why did you give me coffee?
Why did you?

52:22.430 --> 52:23.306
Take it off.

52:23.390 --> 52:24.891
-What?
-Hurry and take it off.

52:25.016 --> 52:26.101
I'll get the stain out.

52:26.184 --> 52:28.520
Do you know how expensive this is?
I can't.

52:28.603 --> 52:31.148
You're worried about water now?
Take it off.

52:31.231 --> 52:32.274
Help her out of it.

52:32.357 --> 52:33.942
-Now?
-Really?

52:34.776 --> 52:36.903
This is nuts!

52:39.531 --> 52:40.448
-Oh my!
-Oh no!

52:40.532 --> 52:42.367
-Ma-rin, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

52:42.826 --> 52:43.702
I'm okay.

52:43.785 --> 52:45.537
You should be careful.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.122
-Are you hurt?
-Thank you.

52:47.205 --> 52:48.582
Thank you.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.755
Do we know each other, by chance?

52:56.298 --> 52:57.132
Excuse me?

52:57.841 --> 52:58.925
Nevermind.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.553
Chairman.

53:02.429 --> 53:03.555
You came.

53:03.638 --> 53:05.807
-Congratulations on your wedding.
-Thank you.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.143
Chairman Kim.

53:09.102 --> 53:10.020
Congratulations.

53:10.103 --> 53:11.188
Thank you very much.

53:12.272 --> 53:13.899
Chairman, please say hello.

53:14.316 --> 53:18.361
This is Chairman Yu So-joon of Myreits.

53:18.945 --> 53:19.821
You know him.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.365
This is Chairman Kim Joong-man
of Hyunshin Capital.

53:22.824 --> 53:25.952
That must be the chairman
of the groom's company.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.996
I heard it's a good company.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.956
How could the chairman be so young?

53:31.374 --> 53:32.751
I'll take my place now.

53:32.834 --> 53:33.668
Yes. Let's go in.

53:39.174 --> 53:41.259
Are you that friendly to everyone?

53:44.846 --> 53:45.847
Ma-rin.

53:51.519 --> 53:52.479
Bap-soon!

53:55.023 --> 53:56.608
You know that woman who fell?

53:56.691 --> 53:58.485
I knew she looked familiar.

53:59.736 --> 54:02.697
It seemed like
she kept staring at you, though.

54:06.368 --> 54:07.244
Hey.

54:07.953 --> 54:11.039
Now, they will exchange rings,

54:11.122 --> 54:14.793
the groom to the bride
and the bride to the groom.

54:41.528 --> 54:45.657
NAMYEONG

55:19.357 --> 55:20.317
Ma-rin.

55:22.235 --> 55:23.153
Ma-rin?

55:23.236 --> 55:24.988
Yes? Ah, yes.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.531
Are you okay?

55:26.698 --> 55:28.116
You look frazzled.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.245
I've been running around all day
carrying bags.

55:35.081 --> 55:40.754
Do you know about a real estate
investment company called Myreits?

55:40.837 --> 55:42.589
Of course, I do. It's famous.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.343
It must be big.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.928
It's one of the most
influential businesses.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.890
Why? Are you interested in investing?

55:52.557 --> 55:53.558
No.

55:54.267 --> 55:55.810
Let's talk about something else.

55:58.021 --> 56:01.274
You're not feeling well.
I don't know if an interview is possible.

56:02.567 --> 56:03.401
Interview?

56:04.611 --> 56:06.946
I'd like to write an article about you.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.700
Not a funny Bap-soon article,
but about the real Song Ma-rin.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.870
I felt it could be helpful to you.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.832
It's okay.
I'm not a celebrity or anything.

56:18.541 --> 56:20.210
Would anyone be interested?

56:20.710 --> 56:24.756
I'll be the one to decide that.
You talk about how you've lived so far.

56:25.048 --> 56:27.008
It's better
if it's something dramatic.

56:29.135 --> 56:31.179
Thank you for that...

56:32.389 --> 56:35.058
Me, do an interview?

57:02.836 --> 57:04.879
Now I'm back to normal, so...

57:27.193 --> 57:29.404
You're a survivor
of the Namyeong accident?

57:30.238 --> 57:31.072
Yes.

57:31.156 --> 57:32.949
SONG MA-RIN

57:33.032 --> 57:36.119
That was the most dramatic event
of my life.

57:38.329 --> 57:41.249
I got into an argument
with a man on the subway.

57:41.332 --> 57:42.834
We happened to get off first.

57:43.209 --> 57:44.919
The accident happened after that.

57:45.003 --> 57:47.046
BAP-SOON, A SURVIVOR
OF NAMYEONG ACCIDENT

57:47.130 --> 57:48.923
Miraculously, I lived.

57:52.802 --> 57:54.762
BAP-SOON, A SURVIVOR
OF NAMYEONG ACCIDENT

57:56.389 --> 58:00.477
So, I have to be strong
and live a long life.

58:01.686 --> 58:03.146
Because I am still alive now.

58:04.772 --> 58:07.358
<i>Is this good enough for an article?</i>

58:07.817 --> 58:08.860
<i>Namyeong Station?</i>

58:09.235 --> 58:10.111
<i>You?</i>

58:10.528 --> 58:12.197
Why are you taking pictures of me?

58:12.280 --> 58:14.949
<i>You're that woman who saved my life?</i>

58:21.331 --> 58:23.708
<i>You miraculously lived</i>
<i>on the same day I did.</i>

58:25.376 --> 58:27.504
<i>You die on the same day that I die.</i>

58:29.214 --> 58:30.131
<i>What is this?</i>

58:30.590 --> 58:33.343
<i>You and I... what's our connection?</i>

58:36.804 --> 58:40.475
When the article
about today's interview comes out...

58:41.643 --> 58:44.354
will people think of me differently?

58:44.687 --> 58:46.523
You know you've asked that five times?

58:46.606 --> 58:48.191
Ever since we were eating.

58:49.275 --> 58:50.151
Have I?

58:54.280 --> 58:55.949
I don't need anything more.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.410
I just want them to think of me

59:00.161 --> 59:04.916
as someone who thinks and smiles
like a normal person.

59:05.250 --> 59:07.710
You don't need to pay attention
to other people.

59:09.420 --> 59:11.089
That's easier said than done.

59:14.467 --> 59:16.177
It will be autumn soon.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.889
I don't know why time goes by so fast.

59:20.473 --> 59:22.934
Then you should date. Time is precious.

59:24.894 --> 59:26.521
Would you like to see a movie?

59:27.730 --> 59:29.732
Song Ma-rin, let's talk.

59:29.816 --> 59:30.733
Who are you?

59:30.817 --> 59:32.068
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

59:32.151 --> 59:33.653
-Hey!
-It won't take long.

59:33.736 --> 59:34.696
-Ma-rin.
-I...

59:35.947 --> 59:37.365
I'll call you later.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.909
Hey!

59:41.578 --> 59:42.412
Hey!

59:45.331 --> 59:47.792
Why are you suddenly appearing
and doing this?

59:51.963 --> 59:54.048
You pretended not to know me
earlier today.

59:56.217 --> 59:59.304
You said we shouldn't contact each other
or run into each other.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:02.682
<i>Wait.</i>

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:06.019
What is your name?

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:13.401
Now that I think about it,
I never even asked you your name.

1:00:15.361 --> 1:00:16.195
My name...

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:18.698
Why?

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:21.618
Do you feel sorry, suddenly?

1:00:22.952 --> 1:00:24.120
There's no need to.

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:26.956
-We're not in a relationship.
-My name is...

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:34.047
I am Yu So-joon.

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:36.841
But...

1:00:38.676 --> 1:00:41.429
who are you?

1:01:10.583 --> 1:01:11.834
<i>Are you a survivor of</i>

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:14.003
<i>the Namyeong Station accident</i>
<i>seven years ago?</i>

1:01:14.087 --> 1:01:17.674
<i>I did think</i>
<i>you two had an incredible fate.</i>

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:20.510
I will never fall for you,
no matter what you do.

1:01:20.593 --> 1:01:24.430
<i>The day that woman and I die is exactly</i>
<i>ten years after that subway accident.</i>

1:01:24.555 --> 1:01:25.973
<i>Have a child.</i>

1:01:26.891 --> 1:01:28.768
What you look like.
You look... cute.

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:31.896
<i>Why act so strange?</i>
<i>We have no special relationship.</i>

1:01:31.979 --> 1:01:36.984
I... will save you.

1:01:40.113 --> 1:01:42.115
