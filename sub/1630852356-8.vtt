Gaaahhh!

07:46.290 --> 07:48.289
[hysterical laughter]
Aaahhh!

07:48.290 --> 07:49.829
[all groan]

07:49.830 --> 07:51.829
If he hadn't already
chipped his tooth,

07:51.830 --> 07:53.419
that's where
he would have done it.

07:53.420 --> 07:56.289
[groaning]

07:56.290 --> 07:58.169
[sharp gasps]
Where am I?

07:58.170 --> 07:59.379
What is this filthy hovel?

07:59.380 --> 08:02.289
Well, uh, this is our home.

08:02.290 --> 08:04.329
Uh... frozen peas?

08:04.330 --> 08:06.579
What, you want me
to fix those, too?

08:06.580 --> 08:09.379
Oh, no, no, son.
You can't fix peas--

08:09.380 --> 08:11.379
they're perfect
just the way they are.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.919
But when frozen,
they can help fix
a bump to the noggin.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.379
Uh... thanks.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.669
That's... nice of you.

08:17.670 --> 08:18.100
[pained hiss]

08:18.101 --> 08:20.789
I don't deserve your pity peas.

08:20.790 --> 08:23.379
No, you don't,
but that's how
we treat folks here--

08:23.380 --> 08:25.119
with common decency.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.079
We're just glad you're okay.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.169
I'm not okay.
My dad's gonna be so upset.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.289
Huh? What's your dad
got to do with this?

08:32.290 --> 08:33.959
He's the CEO of Wholesome Foods,

08:33.960 --> 08:35.749
and he's the one
who wanted me to say sorry

08:35.750 --> 08:37.379
and get this contract signed.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.289
Well, uh...
are you sorry?

08:39.290 --> 08:40.499
No!

08:40.500 --> 08:43.289
Yes.
Ugh, I don't know.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.709
But if I don't do this,
then I'm out of the company.

08:45.710 --> 08:48.499
I guess I've completely
messed everything up.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.499
You know, Chip,

08:50.500 --> 08:51.100
I understand how you feel.

08:51.101 --> 08:54.289
Uh, how?
You're, like, poor.

08:54.290 --> 08:55.539
You can sass me if you want,

08:55.540 --> 08:57.329
but I'm just bein' honest.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.119
It's like I'm always
tellin' my boy--

08:59.120 --> 09:00.419
you gotta put in the work

09:00.420 --> 09:02.209
before you can reap the rewards.

09:02.210 --> 09:05.379
Huh. That's what
my dad's always telling me.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.169
It might not be easy,
but if you do that,

09:07.170 --> 09:09.210
you can have anything
you want in life.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.079
Green family,
I'm sorry, for everything.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.379
I mean, I know things
haven't always been great

09:16.380 --> 09:19.119
between me and, well,
mostly Cricket,

09:19.120 --> 09:21.119
but I'd like to turn
things around, for reals.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.379
I'm gonna finish
what I started--

09:22.380 --> 09:24.419
the roof, the garden,
everything--

09:24.420 --> 09:27.619
because it's
what you all deserve.

09:27.620 --> 09:28.620
Huh?

09:28.621 --> 09:30.379
♪ Ta-da! ♪

09:30.380 --> 09:32.579
What? But I didn't even
finish fixing your house!

09:32.580 --> 09:34.829
Well, Chip, I didn't wanna
sign because I didn't think

09:34.830 --> 09:36.789
you could be sincere
about an apology.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.789
But I can see that this time,
you really mean it.

09:38.790 --> 09:41.539
So we'd be happy
to sign this as a family!

09:41.540 --> 09:45.039
[angry groan]
Ah, fine! Sure.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.879
But you still
better fix everything
you messed up, bougie boy!

09:48.880 --> 09:50.420
I think I can swing that.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.249
[awkward chuckle]
Oops.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.419
They say the only constant
in life is change,

09:56.420 --> 09:58.749
and that sure is the case
here at Wholesome Foods.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.499
With my retiring,
someone new is stepping
into my position.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.249
Choosing that person was easy

10:03.250 --> 10:05.289
because I've seen him
change for the better.

10:05.290 --> 10:07.099
I, of course, am talking
about my son, Chip Whistler,

10:07.100 --> 10:10.289
the new CEO of Wholesome Foods!

10:10.290 --> 10:11.100
[applause]

10:11.101 --> 10:13.329
Hey hey.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.829
Mmm.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.110
I know you'll make me
proud, son.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.619
[softly]
Wow.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.499
- Hard to believe
it's all mine now.
- Yeah, boss.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.329
Real nice of you
to patch things up
with that family.

10:26.330 --> 10:29.379
That was pretty nice of me.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.619
But now things are gonna change.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.540
All right, let's can this junk.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.329
Send in my private dentist.

10:41.330 --> 10:42.829
Heya, Chip!

10:42.830 --> 10:45.379
How's my most
frequent customer doin'?

10:45.380 --> 10:47.079
I think I'm ready
for an upgrade.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
Platinum.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.039
Oh ho ho! Yes, sir!

10:50.040 --> 10:52.669
I've put in the work
and I've reaped the rewards.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.459
[muddled] And now I have
the full power

10:54.460 --> 10:56.459
and resources of
the Wholesome Foods Corporation

10:56.460 --> 11:02.169
to finally run the Greens
out of Big City!

11:02.170 --> 11:03.170
[sinister laughter]
