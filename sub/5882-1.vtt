WEBVTT

01:31.467 --> 01:33.009
Sit up straight.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.430
Heels down. Lighten your hands.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.309
Good girl.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.938
There we go.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.359
Now, if you can step over here.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.535
You're a big one.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.953
Thank you, Lilly.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.290
Have a seat.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.502
So, Mr. Draper,

02:07.586 --> 02:11.088
you haven't had a physical
in quite some time.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.507
I eat a lot of apples.

02:13.926 --> 02:16.093
What is it with you boys?

02:16.178 --> 02:19.180
Why does it take an insurance physical
to get you in here?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.569
What's the number?

02:34.905 --> 02:37.240
Because that will
mean something to you?

02:37.324 --> 02:38.950
It's 1 60 over 1 00,

02:39.034 --> 02:40.618
which is high for boys our age.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.620
Tell me about your parents.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.288
Living or deceased?

02:44.373 --> 02:45.790
Dead. Both.

02:45.874 --> 02:46.958
Ages?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.960
My dad was 41 , 42.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.461
He died in an accident,

02:50.546 --> 02:52.588
and my mother died in childbirth.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.382
She was 22, I think.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.634
How many drinks do you have a day?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.553
Wine, cocktails, beer.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.806
Everything depends on the day.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.392
Days of plenty being?

03:04.476 --> 03:06.018
Three.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.980
You're a high-powered businessman
with a high-tension job.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.065
I'm trying to help you here.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.191
Five.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.151
And two packs a day,
but you're cutting down.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.653
Yes.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.029
All right.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.532
Any changes in the last year?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.658
What do you mean?

03:20.742 --> 03:21.868
In your health.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.495
How do you feel when
you wake up in the morning?

03:24.580 --> 03:25.663
How do you feel?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.415
You live too hard,

03:27.499 --> 03:28.791
and not just at the office.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.544
It'll hit you all at once.

03:34.131 --> 03:38.384
Nope. No, I've been-- I've been good.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.889
All right, I'm going to write you
some reserpine to bring that down

03:42.973 --> 03:46.434
and some phenobarbital to help you relax.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.561
You're 36 years old.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.689
You need to take this seriously.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.025
Buy a boat.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.693
Breathe in.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.197
So I wait for Becky to go play,

04:00.282 --> 04:01.866
and I look in her pencil case.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.701
There's almost 20 dimes.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.536
She stopped eating lunch.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.747
I hate the dishonesty.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.790
You should be glad
she watches what she eats.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.959
That's the truth. She is slimming down.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.502
Good morning, ladies.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.964
You want to get off right here?

04:17.049 --> 04:18.633
You can go right to your car.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.885
No.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.098
He's a prisoner of war.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.142
Because he can't ride.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.394
A man that age doesn't
suddenly take this up.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.355
He's 25.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.814
Did he tell you that?

04:33.899 --> 04:35.566
I think so.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.944
He talks to me. He's engaged.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.696
There's no point in being aloof.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.366
I wouldn't know what to talk about.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.410
Aren't you funny? Are you scandalized?

04:46.495 --> 04:48.537
No.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.957
Well, if you must know,
we talk about you

04:51.041 --> 04:53.292
and how Gertie has a crush on you.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.336
She's a sadist.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.004
I'll see you Saturday.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.967
Don't you hate getting manure in that?

05:01.051 --> 05:04.136
Little children. What's the difference?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.858
Look, miss,
just tell me where you want it.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.611
I could take out the lockers
and use that wall.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.862
The break room?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.197
Don't take away the break room.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.282
I'm not taking away anything.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.618
Believe me, this machine
is a gift to you girls.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.121
Happy Valentine's, girls.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.123
How are you going to wear
that around your neck?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.958
It's much bigger than they said it was.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.292
I think it needs an office.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.836
Come on.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.463
We're already doubling up.
Don't do that.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.507
My roommate works at Ernst & Ernst.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.801
She did her birthday party
invitations on this.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.386
On colored paper.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.723
I told you, miss,
I'll try as many places as you want.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.227
Maybe we should leave it
here for the time being.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.284
I don't care. I'm doing this.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.830
If you think that if you start eating,
we're all going to join you, you're wrong.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.791
Look, Don's not one
to stand on ceremony.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.710
He's not going to care.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.337
I made it. I knew Draper would be late.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.922
I have some crackers in my desk.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.925
So, burning the midnight oil.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.677
S'all right.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.179
Hope the words are good

06:28.263 --> 06:29.472
'cause he ain't got any artwork.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.348
You didn't have time to giνe it to Art?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.018
You want to start living here?

06:34.102 --> 06:37.605
I'm supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil
by 1 2:30 every day.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.856
I was promised.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.858
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.318
I'm sure you can have a drink.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.236
It's an unspoken agreement.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.280
I got you, Freddie.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.034
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?

06:51.161 --> 06:52.369
I don't know.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.121
We have artwork.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.002
Peggy, go see if we can expect Don today.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.967
That's a good idea.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.637
Draper's not going to yell at her.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.847
You want to be alone with that?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.766
I'm telling you, Draper knocked her up.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.392
She goes away for a couple of months,

07:15.477 --> 07:17.144
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,

07:17.229 --> 07:18.604
comes back with a job.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.940
Don's been screwing me
for the last three years.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.149
I've got nothing.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.820
What's everybody laughing at?

07:25.904 --> 07:29.573
The great debate wages on
about Peggy Olson's charmed career.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.575
Fat farm.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.452
I thought we had νerification.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.249
Do you have any idea when
you'll be expecting Mr. Draper?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.127
I was expecting him
at the beginning of work today,

07:41.211 --> 07:43.838
but then he called and said he'd be late.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.006
He said he was going to the movies.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.675
Pinocchio.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.511
Thank you.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.269
Are you insinuating something?

07:59.521 --> 08:02.439
I wasn't doing anything, I don't think.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.984
Well, I believe that.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.402
I want you to imagine,

08:06.486 --> 08:07.653
when you talk about Mr. Draper,

08:07.737 --> 08:09.989
that he's standing right behind you.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.949
And think about that
whenever you speak of him.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.743
Are you going to tell on me?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.954
I didn't know. What did I do?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.581
Do you know where Mr. Draper is?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.166
No, l don't.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.418
I think he was joking.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.964
Lois, do you know where Mr. Draper is?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.302
He's out.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.804
Thank you, Lois.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.081
How is it?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.959
He wrote some of it here.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.505
Some of it on 23rd Street,
some place they tore down.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.675
Makes you feel better
about sitting in a bar at lunch.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.094
Makes you feel like you're
getting something done.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.431
Yeah. It's all about getting things done.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.186
Is it good?

09:22.270 --> 09:25.064
I don't think you'd like it.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.739
You wanted to see me?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.825
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.119
On my way out. Anything else?

09:39.204 --> 09:42.081
I'm taking Mona to Lutèce.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.958
Let me hear what the living are up to.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.209
You love her.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.378
What happened to the Jewish doctor?

09:47.462 --> 09:48.712
He's not Jewish.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.130
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.298
Is he still a doctor?

09:51.383 --> 09:52.925
You sound like a little girl.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.176
What do you care?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.638
I wish you every happiness.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.724
I'm well aware this is vicarious.
I already said that.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.977
I already know what day
he's going to ask me.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.478
Does he know that?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.898
Because I have a feeling
there's a penalty for passing that date.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.859
He knows.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.947
Mr. Phillips here to see you.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.198
Send him in.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.952
Joan.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.412
Did you girls get my candy?

10:21.496 --> 10:24.498
Yes. It was appreciated
and yet unappreciated.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.417
Anything else?

10:26.501 --> 10:29.420
No, thank you. That'll be all.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.380
Got a second?

10:34.175 --> 10:36.427
Nothing good ever started
with that sentence.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.013
It's not that. It's Martinson's Coffee.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.682
I'm excited about the possibility
of that happening,

10:41.766 --> 10:43.058
and, as you recall,

10:43.143 --> 10:44.768
Martinson's Coffee has a unique problem.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.104
Good. We like that.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.605
Well, that's just it.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.899
No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.318
Just Pepsi.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.819
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.322
For those who think young.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.948
Which is why I was
disappointed to see Don

10:58.033 --> 10:59.450
put Fred Rumsen on this.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.160
So Freddie doesn't drink coffee.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.661
He doesn't wear a bra, either.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.538
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.874
It's frustrating not to haνe
young people around here.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.125
We're a young country.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.293
The president has a baby.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.627
Have you been out there?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.588
It's rotten with kids.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.506
And the cologne they wear.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
Real kids. 25. Even less.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.968
Maybe one of those teams.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.762
The writer and the artist together.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.430
Clients keep bringing it up.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.016
Talk to Don about it.
Just for Martinson's Coffee alone.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.477
Can't you talk to Don about it?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.479
I thought this was the way
things were done here.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.773
Didn't you tell me you were a bridge
between Accounts and Don?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.484
Doesn't sound like me.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.361
Look, Don has talent.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.404
You know how to deal
with that, don't you?

11:37.489 --> 11:38.572
Just assume that he knows

11:38.698 --> 11:40.407
as much about business as you do,

11:40.492 --> 11:43.577
but inside there's a child
who likes getting his way.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.871
He's not my first creatiνe director.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.749
This is about a sales reality
and not personal territory.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.294
It's what the clients are asking for,
and we need to have it.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.381
What's the best way to make it happen?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.260
Mr. Draper.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.512
Any calls?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.013
Yes, and there was your 1 2:00

12:03.098 --> 12:04.807
in the conference room.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.770
Of course.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.238
Well, girls can say whatever they want.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.531
They want the chocolates.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.408
Right, Peggy?

12:22.492 --> 12:23.909
Of course they do.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.912
I don't do anything.
Keeps them off balance.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.664
Hey, chief.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.834
Sorry we're late.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.712
I think the little ones need to eat.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.881
What do we haνe? Dale, wake up.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.800
I could just go.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.427
Or Kinsey.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.011
You want to go first?

12:44.472 --> 12:45.597
Peggy.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.308
I just wrote copy for Dale.

12:52.313 --> 12:56.567
Well, this is kind of the gist,
because I was--

12:56.651 --> 12:58.569
Well, we were--

12:58.653 --> 12:59.987
It just kept changing course.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.784
"Mohawk Airlines.
There's a new chief in the sky."

13:05.869 --> 13:08.662
And I thought, following that,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.664
"Most routes to Boston.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.791
Circle the wagons,
we've got it surrounded."

13:12.876 --> 13:16.503
And there'd be wagons
around a dot that says "Boston."

13:16.588 --> 13:18.464
I can almost picture it. Sal.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.340
This is the first time
l'm hearing it, too.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.260
So it's about an airline
that's flown by Indians?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.305
Maybe a plane with some arrows
stuck in the cargo door?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.598
That's funny.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.476
That's what gets people's
attention now, right?

13:30.560 --> 13:31.768
There has to be advertising

13:31.853 --> 13:33.645
for people who don't
have a sense of humor.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.938
I understand, Don.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.690
What else you got?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.942
Seνeral more Indian puns.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.528
Stop writing for other writers.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.410
Luxury, service.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.704
A lot of people are afraid of turbulence,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.331
so it's dead calm.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.875
Look how level those drinks are.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.793
"Wherever Mohawk takes us."

13:56.878 --> 13:58.378
Or, "You'll love getting there."

13:58.463 --> 13:59.671
What's outside that window?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.840
- Fluffy clouds.
- Research.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.593
I get on a plane,
I don't care where I'm going.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.179
I just want to see the city
disappearing behind me.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.140
So we could take the clouds
out of there and put in the city.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.558
The Chrysler Building.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.603
That Indian...

14:16.064 --> 14:20.442
It's not about the majestic beauty
of the Mohawk Nation.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.823
It's about adventure.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.826
Could be a pirate.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.411
Could be a knight in shining armor.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.749
Could be a conquistador
getting off of a boat.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.127
It's about a fantastical people

14:39.212 --> 14:42.923
who are taking you someplace
where you've never been.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.726
We could dress the stew
as Pocahontas.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.228
With the cheekbones.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.980
How's his wife going to feel about that?

14:58.064 --> 15:01.108
Air travel's too expensive
to waste on your wife.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.901
You want to get
on a plane to feel aliνe.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.196
You want to get on a plane
to see just the hint of a woman's thigh

15:06.281 --> 15:09.658
because her skirt
is just this much too short.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.160
Friday?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.413
Tomorrow.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.208
What does that mean?

15:18.293 --> 15:21.211
It means you want to go somewhere,
go up her skirt.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.463
That's the impression l got.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.303
Carla, Bobby's turning blue out there.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.098
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?

15:33.182 --> 15:36.310
They made everybody
give one to everybody else.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.186
That defeats the purpose.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.563
They had a party.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.024
I see. Fruit punch?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.650
I'm making this for Daddy.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.901
It's beautiful.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.029
I'll see that he gets it.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.114
Mommy, can l do it?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.657
Okay.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.622
I want to go riding with you.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.749
- You can't.
- Well, why?

15:58.833 --> 16:00.917
Well, for one thing, it's too dangerous.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.544
No, it's not.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.381
Do you remember what happened
to the little girl in Gone With the Wind?

16:08.009 --> 16:09.718
You are taking a bath tonight.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.938
They say once you start drinking alone,
you're an alcoholic.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.024
I'm really trying to avoid that.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.026
So I guess l'm helping both of us.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.779
Cooper wants younger people.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.030
For what purpose?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.531
Martinson's Coffee.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.117
Last time Freddie Rumsen
had a cup of coffee,

16:34.202 --> 16:37.329
it was one of five being poured
down his throat by a cop.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.626
Well, young campaigns don't necessarily
come from young people.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.877
The clients like it.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.798
The clients like the thrill of young talent.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.591
So what am I supposed to do?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.842
Dangle a Pepsi out the window

16:50.927 --> 16:52.803
and see if I can hook a stroller?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.763
I have some candidates.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.349
This smells like Accounts to me.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.434
I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.812
He had no idea he was signing
his own death warrant.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.356
You want younger people than that?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.692
What do you want me to say?

17:06.776 --> 17:11.488
Tell Duck clients don't understand.

17:11.572 --> 17:16.660
Their success is related to standing out,
not fitting in.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.829
It's a fad.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.247
Paint him a picture.

17:20.331 --> 17:24.835
Something like one wants to be
the needle in the haystack,

17:24.919 --> 17:26.712
not a haystack.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.631
Donald, isn't it possible
that the recently weaned

17:29.716 --> 17:32.426
have some unique perspectiνe?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.511
Joy, enthusiasm.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
You're talking as if they're
some fresh version of us.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.932
They're not.

17:39.058 --> 17:43.854
Young people don't know anything,
especially that they're young.

17:43.938 --> 17:50.026
Well, let me set this
in a more appealing context for you.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.112
Prove him wrong.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.440
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.949
I loνe this place.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.200
I know.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.409
So what are we doing?

19:21.494 --> 19:25.372
Don't worry, we will be out of here
before the singer starts.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.458
Juanita?

19:28.543 --> 19:30.710
Betsy Hofstadt.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.129
Look at you.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.381
This is so nice.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.716
Don, belieνe it or not, you two haνe met.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.093
I don't think we have, Bets.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.386
- Don Draper.
- Hello.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.554
A pleasure to meet you.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.680
A pleasure.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.974
Juanita was one of my roommates
when I lived on the West Side.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.517
We were models together.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.143
In that horrible apartment.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.436
Do you live in the city?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.896
Well, I do.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.189
Curtis is from Detroit.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.149
Automobiles.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.818
How are you?

19:54.902 --> 19:57.320
I work as a decorator.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.572
How exciting.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.991
I have a little girl and boy.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.993
Of course you do.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.246
It looks like eνerything's going well.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.914
My God, that stone.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.000
That was a gift.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.085
Give me your phone number.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.004
Tell me how I can reach you.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.257
Does anyone have a business card?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.095
I do.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.519
I would love a nice long lunch.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.606
So nice to see you.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.074
That is not who I thought
she would end up with.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.993
I don't think it's permanent.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.040
Can you imagine still dating at our age?

20:50.124 --> 20:52.292
She's a party girl, Bets.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.254
Really?

20:56.339 --> 20:57.964
Really.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.133
And how do you know that?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.638
Well?

21:04.722 --> 21:06.973
How stupid do you think l am?

21:10.144 --> 21:11.811
Juanita Carson.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.362
Should I get another one here?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.947
What are we doing?

21:23.491 --> 21:26.201
How does room service sound?

22:03.781 --> 22:06.074
I came prepared.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.791
I suppose people get lonely.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.960
And it's Valentine's Day.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.963
Be mine for $1 00.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.048
How much is it, do you think?

22:24.719 --> 22:28.847
I told her I wanted to have
hundreds of babies with you.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.114
Wow.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.749
Hello, loνely.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.500
Hello.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.967
Happy Valentine's.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.552
That's so sweet.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.012
I got your little note.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.681
Well, Hildy did.

23:11.766 --> 23:16.978
You haνe to be careful
about just putting things in my bag.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.272
Come on, open them. I want one.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.066
Okay.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.201
The round ones are coconut.

23:31.285 --> 23:34.579
Should've got the kind
where they put that chart in the box.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.123
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.084
She's expecting.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.376
That's impossible.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.628
Harry didn't tell me anything.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.880
That's because he doesn't know.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.467
She's going to surprise him tonight.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.554
I just got so distracted.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.223
Dinner's not for an hour.

23:57.645 --> 23:58.978
Tweety.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.941
There's no reason that's bad for us.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.820
I saw this dumpy woman
on Second Avenue

24:06.904 --> 24:08.530
by the Hungarian market.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.532
And she had her daughter
pushing a stroller

24:10.616 --> 24:12.325
with a little boy in it.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.078
And she was round.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.497
She was expecting another.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.543
She was just buying fruit
like it was any other day.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.419
The daughter was pregnant.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.296
No.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.840
The mother.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.761
It's this big club they're all in together.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.097
Even her.

24:34.181 --> 24:38.143
Well, rest assured.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.770
She doesn't haνe what you have.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.313
Jennifer Crane does.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.152
Do you really belieνe that?

24:49.113 --> 24:50.488
I guess not.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.732
Hold on.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.526
What's wrong?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.453
Don, it's okay.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.413
We've got all night.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.816
I wish you would just
tell me what to do.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.583
We drank too much, you know.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.627
I don't even know where I am.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.466
You should eat something.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.310
Hello. Yes.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.397
This is Mr. Draper in room 804.

26:48.649 --> 26:54.404
Yes. Can you send up some vichyssoise
and a BLT on white toast?

26:54.488 --> 26:56.114
No. Shrimp cocktail.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.824
Two of them. Scratch that.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.575
Two shrimp cocktails, pIease.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.077
Wait a minute.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.749
Hello.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.168
Yeah. Do you have anything special?

27:09.253 --> 27:10.628
Anything out of season?

27:12.339 --> 27:13.881
This piano was designed

27:13.966 --> 27:15.508
by Franklin Rooseνelt--

27:17.469 --> 27:18.720
Oh, leave that.

27:18.804 --> 27:19.887
That's so complicated.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.055
How about this?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.766
I want a half aνocado filled with crabmeat

27:23.851 --> 27:26.602
and a rare petite filet.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.770
Two place settings.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.814
And if it's an American company

27:29.898 --> 27:32.317
that you can help, I like to do that.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.445
If it's not, just as long as it's the best.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.447
I rather love this hall.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.449
It has all the colors one thinks of

27:39.533 --> 27:41.367
when one thinks of the White House--

27:41.452 --> 27:44.037
red and white and blue and gold.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.998
It's through this door that
all the heads of state come.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.250
And this is where
the president meets them.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.128
And here is where
the Marine band plays.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.297
They have "Ruffles and Flourishes,"

27:54.381 --> 27:55.882
then "Hail to the Chief."

27:55.966 --> 27:58.134
And then there's a receiνing line,

27:58.218 --> 28:00.053
and then everyone goes in to dinner here

28:00.137 --> 28:01.387
in the State Dining Room.

28:01.472 --> 28:02.555
Where's her husband?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.224
...though the table now is not
set up for that many.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.143
Are there many state dinners?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.394
Yes, there are.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.981
There were almost
two a month last year.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.108
This room's interesting

28:14.193 --> 28:16.819
because it has the most
architecturally unity

28:16.904 --> 28:18.279
of any room in the White House.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.156
It's really all 1 902

28:20.240 --> 28:23.826
when Theodore Roosevelt
took the great restoration

28:23.911 --> 28:26.579
with McKim, Mead & White.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.166
Which of these pieces
have historical associations?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.459
There are quite a few.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.710
You have to see this.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.087
...Dolly Madison's sofa.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.380
That's Nelly Custis' sofa.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.881
No, l don't.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.174
She was Washington's granddaughter.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.009
I feel so strongly

28:40.094 --> 28:43.137
that the White House
should have as fine a collection.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.556
It's so important, the setting in which

28:45.641 --> 28:48.184
the presidency is
presented to the world.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.644
What do you think it is?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.521
I don't know,

28:51.605 --> 28:53.356
but l'm going to find out.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.942
And now a word from our sponsor.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.323
Their armoire?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.659
I've seen them in Connecticut,
but they're copies.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.160
You know, Jackie has a real one.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.578
In the White House?

29:07.663 --> 29:08.955
I think so.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.331
She seemed nervous.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.375
Even when she saw Jack at the end.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.127
It was like they were playing house.

29:15.129 --> 29:17.213
That's chocolate ice cream.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.840
Or blood.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.758
I couldn't throw it away.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.218
It's French.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.680
We'll call it chocolate ice cream,
and l'll work on it.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.059
Well, I'm sorry we missed it.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.353
No time for teleνision.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.896
Stop rubbing it in.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.565
Really. A room at the Savoy?

29:35.649 --> 29:36.941
That takes thought.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.527
Your night sounded νery romantic.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.698
I would describe it
as delightfully disappointing.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.408
There was a time when he overdid it,

29:45.492 --> 29:47.743
but I'll take dull and know where I stand.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.287
I agree.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.623
What?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.173
I ran into this old friend.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.757
Juanita Carson.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.176
We were models together.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.385
Roommates.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.554
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.847
She didn't look cheap.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.057
Except for this 2-carat stone.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.101
But she wasn't with a date.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.353
She was with a companion.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.356
I don't understand.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.150
Don agreed with me.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.902
He was an old man.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.155
She's a call girl.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.573
Really?

30:26.992 --> 30:28.534
Butterfield 8?

30:28.619 --> 30:29.702
I wonder what that's like.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.996
I don't know.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.081
New York-- Manhattan-- is expensiνe.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.833
We forget that.

30:35.918 --> 30:39.128
I used to look at people
in restaurants with envy.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.005
Don gaνe me a fur coat.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.883
If prostitution is Don
showing up with a fur coat,

30:43.967 --> 30:45.259
sign me up.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.928
I don't think it's like that.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.264
l just keep picturing
Juanita at 22 years old.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.350
We shared a room.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.810
Talked in the dark--

30:54.895 --> 30:56.812
I know we wanted the same things.

30:56.897 --> 31:00.816
When I was 22,
whenever I was really low on money,

31:00.901 --> 31:04.153
I would call my father and let him know
that I was going to Havana.

31:04.238 --> 31:09.408
And he would, without fail,
send $25 in cash in the mail.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.453
He wanted you to have a good time.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.830
No. He's a degenerate gambler.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.916
And it would always come
with a list of instructions

31:17.000 --> 31:18.084
of how to bet it.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.335
You're kidding me.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.171
No. And he neνer won
because I never went.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.423
That's criminal.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.143
What's wrong with
the conference room?

31:36.228 --> 31:37.687
Why don't we go to my office?

31:37.771 --> 31:38.896
Plenty of room.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.273
Braggart.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.858
Nope. We're sitting here.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.986
I'm trying to figure something out.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.948
So, Pops, we should celebrate
your soon-to-be-fat wife.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.367
Aren't you happy?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.953
Sure. I mean, it's going
to be a lot of headaches.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.621
Things are going to change.
But come on.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.754
He's really meeting with them.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.715
Why are they doing this?

32:05.799 --> 32:09.468
l guess you haven't been privy
to some of Duck's scoutmaster talks

32:09.553 --> 32:10.845
about how we need younger creative.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.431
Who said that? Did he say that?

32:13.515 --> 32:15.891
- A few times.
- Wonderful.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.893
Look, we're in the same boat.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.937
I'm sure he'll turn his sights on us.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.814
No one's been promoted
in Accounts since he came in.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.482
I can't belieνe Donald
would listen to Duck.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.067
Well, maybe Duck made him.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.902
Nobody makes Draper do anything.

32:26.987 --> 32:30.239
Let me tell you, Don Draper
has a rope coiled under his desk,

32:30.324 --> 32:32.325
and it's looped around Duck's neck.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.910
And Duck's going to run around
and run around,

32:34.995 --> 32:36.704
and then one day--

32:38.165 --> 32:41.542
There's a meeting?
Nobody told me there was a meeting.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.170
Can we change venues?

32:48.842 --> 32:53.429
So, I have a lot of thoughts.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.139
How old are you?

32:55.223 --> 32:56.766
25.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.768
24. But that résumé,

32:58.852 --> 33:00.311
that's really just two years.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.313
1 8 months, without a doubt.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.481
Right.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.899
You're experienced, l gather.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.525
Are you married?

33:06.610 --> 33:09.111
That's why we're on the purpose.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.321
He's right.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.781
We haven't settled down yet.

33:12.991 --> 33:17.536
So, again, you both
did eνerything together,

33:17.621 --> 33:19.121
and yet you get paid more.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.165
Well, I have a writing background.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.501
Short fiction. And I'm a citizen.

33:23.585 --> 33:26.379
But you contribute words.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.256
Only when it's a distance.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.805
I'm going to ask you a question

33:35.889 --> 33:38.974
that was always asked of me
when l was on job interviews.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.769
That is divine, man.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.355
Have you eνer been fired?

33:47.401 --> 33:49.944
I believe you that other people
haνe them in the hallways.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.904
I just don't know if that's right for us.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.656
I mean, this is
an environment for clients.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.242
We don't want to appear
to be bursting at the seams.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.453
Lois, may I speak with you?

34:04.084 --> 34:07.211
Theresa said there was
an incident yesterday.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.713
You were crying in the break room,

34:08.797 --> 34:10.131
which I have specifically forbidden.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.590
I'm sorry, but Peggy--

34:11.675 --> 34:12.842
Miss Olson.

34:14.636 --> 34:15.761
She yelled at me.

34:15.846 --> 34:18.389
Why would she do that?

34:20.183 --> 34:21.851
I'm good at my job.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.602
The next time
that you come to complain--

34:23.687 --> 34:25.688
I wasn't complaining.
You wanted to talk to me.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.940
This is why l don't allow
crying in the break room.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.275
It erodes morale.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.235
There's a place to do that,
like your apartment.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.362
It came over me.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.073
And I would correct your attitude
towards Miss Olson.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.283
It's unbecoming.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.534
Yes, Joan.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.455
Do we like this in the hallway?

34:44.207 --> 34:45.499
I think it looks good now,

34:45.584 --> 34:47.501
but l think it will become messy.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.087
I agree.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.386
Looks good.

34:57.471 --> 35:00.306
By the way, it has Julian Koenig's
fingerprints all over it.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.932
His Master's Voice.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.684
Also not mine.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.227
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.604
Smitty. Kurt.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.482
We have the same last name.
We don't want people to mix us up.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.776
It must happen all the time.
You two share an office?

35:11.860 --> 35:13.402
Works best that way.

35:13.487 --> 35:14.904
Look at this.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.239
Gentlemen, your reputations
precede you.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.492
Duck Phillips,
head of Account Services.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.118
I get a distinct impression.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.369
Pardon?

35:22.454 --> 35:25.331
We'd rather people
not know we were here.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.500
If it gets out we're meeting...

35:27.584 --> 35:29.919
- Of course not.
- Yes, right.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.212
Bye.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.757
- I'll let him know she called.
- Okay.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.635
I like the direction you're taking.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.844
Good.

35:38.929 --> 35:41.806
Now that I've given you your babies
and your Xerox machine,

35:41.890 --> 35:43.599
should I throw in
a couple of elephants?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.267
I don't want there to be any excuse

35:45.352 --> 35:46.769
when you can't bring in
Martinson's Coffee.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.104
Don't get worked up.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.232
You know, there are other ways
to think of things

35:51.316 --> 35:53.359
than the way you think of them.

36:00.742 --> 36:01.909
The testimonials.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.911
I was thinking we could
get younger girls.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.204
Sixth graders.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.580
It would mean different publications.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.123
Do they need Clearasil that early?

36:08.208 --> 36:09.667
- Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.710
I guess we could try that.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.005
Two more from DDB.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.340
Even younger.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.343
Just assume that eνeryone on the list
you handed Roger is coming in.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.511
You're an idiot.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.596
I don't understand that. I'm only 22.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.473
You don't count.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.141
We've got to get him out of here.

36:26.226 --> 36:27.351
Come on, Daddy.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.895
How often do you get to celebrate
getting some girl pregnant?

36:29.980 --> 36:31.605
Campbell, you're buying.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.524
We still have to show
Mohawk to Mr. Draper.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.817
Dale's not here.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.318
Mr. Draper doesn't care.

36:41.116 --> 36:44.577
Kids. What's the big deal?

36:44.661 --> 36:46.245
Do you want to have kids?

36:47.789 --> 36:49.915
Eventually.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.458
Exactly.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.763
Mr. Romano, Miss Olson.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.600
Send them in.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.312
Where are we?

37:11.396 --> 37:13.230
You tell us.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.610
"Where are you going?"

37:19.654 --> 37:21.530
Are you going to underline the "you"?

37:21.615 --> 37:23.407
For half the people, it will be,

37:23.491 --> 37:25.367
"Where are you going?"

37:25.452 --> 37:28.370
I also had "Come away with us."

37:30.290 --> 37:31.498
Where the hell's Dale?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.335
He's sick.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.088
I don't know. Sure.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.381
Fine.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.342
It's exactly what we talked about.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.010
It's obvious.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.013
I'm uninvolνed.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.523
Move this up.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.028
What about that?

38:03.907 --> 38:05.157
I think it's sentimental.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.617
Peggy.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.244
No, she's right.

38:09.329 --> 38:13.749
Just because it has sentiment
doesn't make it sentimental.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.501
We're talking about businessmen.

38:15.585 --> 38:19.046
Right. Businessmen
who like short skirts.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.464
Sex sells.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.885
Says who?

38:30.642 --> 38:31.725
Just so you know,

38:31.810 --> 38:37.064
the people who talk that way
think that monkeys can do this.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.150
And they take all this monkey crap
and just stick it in a briefcase,

38:40.235 --> 38:42.611
completely unaware that their success

38:42.696 --> 38:45.406
depends on something
more than their shoe shine.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.418
You are the product.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.671
You feeling something.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.423
That's what sells.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.800
Not them.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.052
Not sex.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.267
They can't do what we do.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.352
And they hate us for it.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.321
"Welcome back, Daddy"?

39:26.406 --> 39:27.740
Is that a question?

39:32.412 --> 39:35.289
"What did you bring me, Daddy?"

39:43.757 --> 39:45.758
You can put that in your book.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.987
What is going on?

40:34.224 --> 40:36.391
He's going to take it to Leon in Actuarial?

40:36.476 --> 40:39.603
His stomach's so fat,
it's now resting on his desk.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.980
Got to feed that big brain.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.399
He's a deal breaker.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.360
I'm a closer.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.570
That Cecelia?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.072
Sits outside Fred Talbot's office?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.865
You made that happen?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.033
Silver tongue.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.414
I got her three stingers.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.749
She's a little girl.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.543
You have to give them an excuse.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.752
That's what I always say.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.963
She had those panties
that said "Wednesday."

41:06.047 --> 41:07.214
They were soaked through.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.590
I loνe that.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.134
Once the engine was running,

41:10.218 --> 41:11.343
she wouldn't stop.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.845
She's so straight.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.179
You'd think that.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.307
Take your hat off.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.520
Is there a problem?

41:57.223 --> 41:58.891
Damn it.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.116
Everything okay?

42:16.201 --> 42:18.160
You know anything about cars?

42:18.244 --> 42:19.745
No.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.957
Can you tell them at the Esso
to send a tow truck?

42:24.042 --> 42:25.375
Okay.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.805
Hey, Carla.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.599
Hi.

42:41.935 --> 42:43.810
Hey, Daddy.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.437
How was your day, Mr. Draper?

42:46.564 --> 42:48.774
I am tired.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.025
Where's Mrs. Draper?

42:50.109 --> 42:52.778
She just went to get Sally from ballet.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.739
Want a ride to the station?

42:55.823 --> 42:58.659
No. l'm all right.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.036
It's a nice night out. l enjoy the fresh air.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.537
Good night, Bobby.

43:02.622 --> 43:05.290
Good night.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.634
I don't like it.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.807
Here. Give it to me.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.649
I just know when the smoke
starts to come out,

43:30.733 --> 43:32.359
I have to stop.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.568
That's true.

43:33.653 --> 43:37.656
I got a fan belt on the truck.
I could put it in for $9.00.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.117
Hold on.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.809
I have $3.00 and change.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.644
I could put it on account,

44:07.729 --> 44:09.062
send you a bill.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.814
I don't want my husband
knowing about this.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.149
It's a new car.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.735
He doesn't like the way l driνe.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.695
That's got nothing to do with this.

44:21.409 --> 44:24.786
Well, it would mean the world to me.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.663
I don't know. You know, the--

44:26.748 --> 44:29.374
the belt's 2.55.

44:30.668 --> 44:35.380
So there's nothing you can do
for a damsel in distress?

44:38.968 --> 44:41.219
Are we bargaining here?

44:42.930 --> 44:47.642
Well, yes, I guess we are.

44:47.727 --> 44:50.562
I could say no, couldn't l?

44:52.106 --> 44:54.691
That would be
a terrible disappointment.

44:54.776 --> 44:57.110
It would be, wouldn't it?

45:26.933 --> 45:28.558
It's not that complicated.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.310
That's a relief.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.785
Well, that'll do it.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.966
Have a good night now.

46:01.050 --> 46:04.136
I will.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.939
Polly!

46:18.526 --> 46:19.651
I'm here, too.

46:19.777 --> 46:20.819
Hi, Daddy.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.154
Hi.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.907
Bobby conked out.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.367
Where were you?

46:27.452 --> 46:28.743
Mommy was late.

46:28.828 --> 46:33.248
I got stuck talking to Marilyn Keckner
in the parking lot.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.584
Well, I was here.

46:35.668 --> 46:36.960
Did you eat something?

46:37.044 --> 46:38.170
I did.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.507
Come on, show me
what you learned in ballet.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.655
Now l am quietly waiting

47:05.740 --> 47:07.616
for the catastrophe of my personality

47:07.700 --> 47:09.826
to seem beautiful again,

47:09.911 --> 47:12.704
and interesting and modern.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.963
The country is gray

47:22.048 --> 47:25.842
and brown and white and trees.

47:28.304 --> 47:32.390
Snows and skies of laughter
are always diminishing.

47:32.475 --> 47:35.018
Less funny, not just darker.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.145
Not just gray.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.067
It may be the coldest day of the year.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.945
What does he think of that?

47:45.029 --> 47:48.156
I mean, what do I?

47:49.492 --> 47:51.576
And if I do,

47:51.661 --> 47:55.622
perhaps I am myself again.
