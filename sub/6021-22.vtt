24:58.914 --> 25:00.958
our distinguished panel,

25:00.958 --> 25:02.168
let's go to Latham live

25:02.168 --> 25:04.295
where Jane Wells

25:02.168 --> 25:04.295
is standing by. Jane.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.005
Yes, good evening,

25:04.295 --> 25:06.005

25:06.005 --> 25:08.007
What's the mood?

25:06.005 --> 25:08.007
What's going on tonight?

25:08.007 --> 25:10.343
Well, Latham is

25:08.007 --> 25:10.343
fairly quiet tonight

25:10.343 --> 25:11.927
considering

25:10.343 --> 25:11.927
the media circus

25:11.927 --> 25:14.263
that has descended upon

25:11.927 --> 25:14.263
this quaint little town.

25:14.263 --> 25:17.515
And what about the defendants,

25:14.263 --> 25:17.515
the so-called New York Four?

25:17.515 --> 25:18.851
How are they holding up?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.061
Well, I did speak with

25:18.851 --> 25:21.061
one of the deputies

25:21.061 --> 25:24.440
who has some contact with them

25:21.061 --> 25:24.440
and he told me, quote:

25:24.440 --> 25:26.859
"There's no love lost

25:24.440 --> 25:26.859
with that group."

25:26.859 --> 25:28.152
Anything else, Jane?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.154
There also seems to be

25:28.152 --> 25:30.154
some friction

25:30.154 --> 25:32.448
between Mr. Seinfeld

25:30.154 --> 25:32.448
and Ms. Benes.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.367
The rumor is

25:32.448 --> 25:34.367
that they once dated

25:34.367 --> 25:36.785
and it's possible

25:34.367 --> 25:36.785
that ended badly.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.704
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.704
who knows,

25:38.704 --> 25:41.332
maybe this trial will

25:38.704 --> 25:41.332
bring them closer together.

do something wrong?

Maybe it was our fault.
