00:01.760 --> 00:04.445
- Run with that for two minutes, Jon.
- What is 0?

00:04.760 --> 00:06.762
- Jest something filming.
- Hello

00:10.960 --> 00:12.883
Kingy. Kingy.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.682
Get a little fun with him.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.723
Association of Welsh football.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.051
In Collaboration 51 BT SPORT Films.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.682
I do not know how to turn off!

00:34.520 --> 00:38.730
Presenting the Jonny Owen Film.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.489
For almost 60 years Wales has tried to
Get It To hit a big football tournament.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.329
Opportunity for Wales...

00:49.360 --> 00:51.408
Oh, he's hit the beam!

00:53.800 --> 00:56.451
And the referee
moves to the spot!

00:57.080 --> 00:59.845
Well, that's us, 1-0 here
and 3-0 between the two.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.369
McGuire is a deputy...

01:04.400 --> 01:06.084
And then...
It's a horrible thing!

01:07.080 --> 01:09.048
And Véller has hit and
got the second gel!

01:09.720 --> 01:12.200
0! Well.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.322
A kick kick for Scotland!

01:16.800 --> 01:21.442
0, and he got his hands on
it but did not stop him.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.761
Bob Wilson...

01:22.800 --> 01:24.960
You almost never say that
it was a Scotsman's hand.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.806
I do not think, Edward.
It was from the back, I think,

01:32.200 --> 01:34.567
Very decent work...
Devonshire... Butcher!

01:34.600 --> 01:35.886
Latchford!

01:35.920 --> 01:37.976
And here Matheus goes
on and finds Riedle.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.207
It's a really great guy!

01:40.240 --> 01:41.480
Le!

01:45.120 --> 01:47.487
Keegan... It kicks off... Oh!

01:47.520 --> 01:48.567
Druan at 0!

01:49.360 --> 01:52.250
For a disaster for Wales!
They do not believe it!

01:53.960 --> 01:56.725
Well, on the bench, the Welsh are on top!

01:57.200 --> 02:00.568
Wales as a whole has been depressed.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.090
Not done.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.441
Once again, beaten at
the final stage one.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.323
The faces of Welsh
players report volumes

02:08.360 --> 02:10.089
And it's very sad considering

02:10.880 --> 02:14.885
The incredible support
was that they were,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.924
The Welsh team was, to a large
extent, their own enemies.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.245
So another sad story about
disappointment for the Welsh.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.851
Again, so close, yet yet so far.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.208
But I need to go until 19580 to
remember Wales on the biggest platform.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074

02:43.320 --> 02:47.609
In 2010 the former player Gary Speed was
appointed as the National Manager for Wales.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.927
I am a very proud man today
of receiving an invitation

02:49.960 --> 02:51.769
To be Wales Manager.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.244
After 6 months as a manager Wales has
moved 72 sites up to FIFA sites.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.363
Good afternoon. Wales football manager
Gary Speed, died at 42 years of age.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.696
The Football Association of Wales
has told the BBC that it seems

03:24.720 --> 03:26.722
He took his own life.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.004
27th November 2011

03:31.040 --> 03:33.611
I received the call
from Cheshire Police.

03:34.440 --> 03:41.562
TORCALONNUS. The Welsh football
mourns after the death of Gary Speed.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.927
On Sunday morning, I'm
standing a bit on my way

03:43.960 --> 03:45.325
And here I'm looking at my wife

03:45.360 --> 03:48.682
And asks "Jest tell me to her...
Am I awake now? "

03:48.720 --> 03:51.963
Last night, Gary Speed was a hotel
for the BBC on Football Focus

03:52.000 --> 03:54.765
With Dan Walker in the
new studios in Salford.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.442
This is not right... This is not...

04:00.200 --> 04:02.043
Am I absolutely sure?
Am I still sleeping here?

04:03.680 --> 04:06.411
I went with it the previous week.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.090
We went to Belgium to organize the games.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.361
And he was a com master of the meeting.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.643
The Serbs and the Croats were
in the same room, and the Scots

04:13.680 --> 04:17.401
And we did musicians doing
high fives in the hallway,

04:17.440 --> 04:18.851
Things were so good.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.486
And then on Sunday I
got the call here.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.001
You talked to him yesterday.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.441
Yes, Bues I spoke to from yesterday's morning.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.456
We had a good conversation.
We were laughing and a hairdresser.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.767
I saw him on Football Focus yesterday

04:30.800 --> 04:33.280
As did millions of people.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.370
I spoke earlier with Dan Walker,
the program's presenter.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.324
He said there was no
suggestion of any problems

04:39.360 --> 04:40.885
Nothing at all wrong.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.366
Na. Nothing at all. I I.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.336
I can not believe it.
It's a grass for me, <i> and </i> it's gone.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.250
It's like... it's...

04:51.040 --> 04:52.724
I do not know what to say.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.526
A huge coiled for everyone in the world of football.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.449
It was such a good
character, do you know?

05:08.480 --> 05:10.482
And fun.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.930
It was lost when we did
all in perception.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.725
Something you will never come for.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.204
Everyone was full of
sympathy to his family.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.449
What they had to go through.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.845
It was a very sad time.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.611
Everyone was so fond of Gary

05:34.640 --> 05:37.166
Because of what he was
doing outside the boy too.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.764
Apparently it was the
first of our managers

05:40.800 --> 05:44.088
To enter to go to every
town and village.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.176
Did you know that if there was
an event, Gary would go there.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.043
He liked to have fun and laugh.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.762
Enjoyed at the heart
of all the boys.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.016
Enjoyed in the changing room.
His life was Peggy, you know.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.042
Everyone was usually a favorite of Gary.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.526
It was great.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.016
To play over it He was a man of man.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.327
O see what had been
done on the field.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.249
Strong character.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.285
People looked up to him.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.496
We failed to understand
why this had happened.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.922
It was not a long time since
we were with the man.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.406
I remember when it was
appointed, everyone was excited.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.896
He had a plan I'm moving on.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.891
He changed many of the
football and behind the Icons.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.651
He made sure that there was
discipline, that club ambience.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.056
All professional arrangements
had been put in place by him

06:27.080 --> 06:30.080
Which led to turning the corner, which
is why the results were improving.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.216
It's not a comparison of how it
was when I was first, really.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.608
On nutrition, science,
how did we train...

06:37.160 --> 06:38.810
Everything. It was perfect.

06:38.840 --> 06:44.244
The weeks after his death, the
nation came together, in a way.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.080
Because of the office in
Cardiff we get daily visits.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.645
People leaving flowers.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.921
In a very sad way, the nation merged.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.525
We know how lucky the country
was to be a manager and coach

06:57.560 --> 06:59.050
For all our time.

06:59.560 --> 07:05.203
Of course, I'm not seeing it in
the same way is football fans.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.561
They see it as a footballer.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.401
It was for me.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.243
19th century 2012

07:40.280 --> 07:42.886
Nobody really wants to
be here today, is he?

07:43.760 --> 07:45.683
Na. No one, I would
not, if I'm honest.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.407
I think... on the one hand,
it's probably a matter of pride

07:54.080 --> 07:58.005
Most of my career - have the
opportunity to lead my country...

07:59.960 --> 08:02.486
But I Get That Opportunity
because of the circumstances

08:02.520 --> 08:04.887
That nobody was able to predict them.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.122
Frog loss is a terrible thing.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.576
This was a different case, well,
I did his job afterwards.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.856
In a way, it was only possible
to go on doing so well.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.006
When you consider,

08:16.040 --> 08:18.576
A manager often does not take
someone who was doing so well.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.046
They've been getting good
results and things worked.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.764
So why would you want to
change that, is not it?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.287
They have won four of their five.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.562
Lately, not just the win

08:28.240 --> 08:30.527
But the philosophy and style of play

08:30.560 --> 08:33.803
It's been a breath of fresh air for us all

08:33.840 --> 08:35.409
And we've enjoyed that.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.296
I can not believe how difficult
it would have been for him

08:37.320 --> 08:38.684
I stepped in there.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.481
Do you know, I'm sure the job
has always been a dream for him

08:41.600 --> 08:43.090
But not in these circumstances.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.565
It will not be easy.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.728
I know that.
It's never.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.696
Certainly in this situation,
it might be a little harder.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.961
But I'm ready for that.
Unless I think so

08:53.280 --> 08:57.046
That I could have an impact, I
would not have received the job.

08:57.080 --> 09:03.725
Gary Speed's endowment is likely to be
what happens next. Is that the case?

09:03.760 --> 09:09.369
I knew it would be hard, but I did
not expect her to be so difficult.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.129
It was as if...

09:11.160 --> 09:14.056
I do not want to be disturbing, but as
if playing football was meaningless.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.809
Only... What's the point?

09:15.840 --> 09:19.367
Even at the office in Cardiff,
sitting at the office...

09:19.400 --> 09:21.681
In the early days, I do not
like being in the chair,

09:22.080 --> 09:23.969
I do not like being on my own

09:24.000 --> 09:28.403
In the office. Speedo was there
only about a month or two earlier.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.602
There was no breath in us.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.723
And we all want it, because
we all want to do it for it.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.286
But at the same time, it
was as if we failed...

09:36.320 --> 09:41.451
Did you know, it was not enough
for us to get started again.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.605
The nation was grieved.
And the players are certainly grieving too.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.010
And I'm pushing the
players, too hard, I think,

09:52.240 --> 09:56.928
When I should have better understood
what they're going through too.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.284
Our results were not good.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.800
And that was not to be done by the
players, and everything I did to do it.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.049
The atmosphere in the squad
was not great at times.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.726
Did you know, I went into the squad
for the first time for Serbia

10:14.760 --> 10:16.410
Where we lose 6-1

10:16.440 --> 10:18.522
<i>and </i> the burden was to be a length of length.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.131
He was one of the people

10:21.720 --> 10:24.007
I would have talked to him,
I'd like that situation.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.724
Of course, it is not possible. He's not there.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.683
I'm not brave enough to change
what he had been doing.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.047
To what I wanted to do it.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.211
I remember traveling
from the bus on the bus

10:40.600 --> 10:43.729
Get rid of minds.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.201
And he smiles me. And I said "That's it,
that's us. That's the end on that."

10:50.480 --> 10:54.769
I had to stand firmly, and
started to be myself more

10:54.800 --> 10:56.484
And be brave

10:57.000 --> 11:00.129
And do exactly what I wanted to
do instead of what Speedy did.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.724
I stopped with one or
two closest staff to me

11:04.760 --> 11:06.603
To change this and change it

11:06.640 --> 11:08.210
And they were suspicious.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.602
But I'm definitely that
that is the way forward.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.565
And of course the big thing was to
change the captain, 0 Aaron I Ashley.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.360
I knew that Aaron was near Speed

11:19.400 --> 11:22.290
But before I see that affect
her husband, on the field,

11:22.320 --> 11:24.641
And that's the last thing I wanted.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.042
I think I could be one of those
affected more in the team.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.007
Looking now, I think that's the
right thing to do, apparently

11:33.040 --> 11:35.407
And it helped me to get over that.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.206
Everyone asks "How were
things with Aaron?"

11:38.240 --> 11:39.401
And it was absolutely right.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.330
I saw that when we arrived
at the squad the next time.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.761
We did not know
about it, in fact.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.529
We've never heard about it.
<i>Y.</i>

11:46.560 --> 11:48.480
Aaron would have been able
to go down another route.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.882
Had responded differently

11:50.920 --> 11:56.086
And show a different attitude
to give the captain I Ashley

11:56.120 --> 12:00.125
We probably did not have
achieved what we were just doing

12:00.160 --> 12:03.084
For it's so important that
we, Aaron, do you know.

12:09.720 --> 12:14.681
Wales failed to reach
the 2014 World Cup.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.285
They are now ranked 117 in the world.

12:21.680 --> 12:26.527
The lowest in their history.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.927
He needed to shape
his own, and he did

12:28.960 --> 12:30.405
And this is Chris Coleman.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.284
Come on, bois!

12:37.360 --> 12:39.480
- Campaign To reach Euro 2016
- Now about it or even?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.045
No, I would not say.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.765
In the future, teams can
win their place sometime.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.883
But to this group, now, I
think the time is perfect.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.524
This is the time.
We are stable.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.330
We want to do this time.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.203
The first was needed.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.403
To get the campaign on
foot, we needed to win.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.051
No matter how we did that.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.130
So I do not say that it must
finish first or second.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.004
Just think, at 6 or 5 games

13:09.040 --> 13:11.725
If we're third, there's an opportunity.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.963
And it was a matter of
making sure we were in reach

13:17.200 --> 13:21.842
And that meant we needed
to keep it in games.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.607
We do not want to meet.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.962
This will not be a campaign...
Where we will meet on being close

13:31.000 --> 13:33.241
And get backs down for
being ages to make it.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.080
This must be "We've done it."

13:35.160 --> 13:36.600
I thought we were too nice.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.726
And as a nation, we are.
The people of Wales are nice people.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.848
If we need to play ugly for
ten minutes, we will do that.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.645
That's what teams do for us.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.323
Teams do not come to Cardiff
and lie down to us.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.887
And when we go back to their garden,
they make us as difficult as possible.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.009
The biggest impact, I
say, were the supporters.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.485
They become stronger, <i> and</i>
believe more and more.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.761
Helps us through difficult
times in games.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.651
The excitement could be felt.
There was a real passion there.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.082
That's when we started to get seriously,
because the fans were incredible.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.576
And they did that because they
saw what the players had.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.365
<i>The fianh they looked at the
players, who were bated.</i>

14:19.400 --> 14:22.131
Ready for anything
Talk about the challenge.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.969
Ready to do anything for Wales.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.089
And that certainly turned a
switchover into everyone's mind

14:29.120 --> 14:31.407
Did you know that
something was on our way?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.722
Everything was like it
was in the right place

14:33.760 --> 14:37.845
And everybody gives a little more
faith, a little more momentum

14:37.880 --> 14:41.282
And this team came to realize
what exactly we can do.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.322
Mark came the news to me

14:43.360 --> 14:46.170
And I forgot to
do anything else.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.771
We wanted to go to where
our boots were...

14:48.800 --> 14:50.290
Where were all our supporters.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.163
<i>And the players joined.</i>

14:52.200 --> 14:55.204
What does this mean for Wales,
For these people, Chris?

14:55.680 --> 14:59.082
It means everything.
We've all dreamed about this.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.571
This was all.
This is what we always want.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.616
We're going to a tournament.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.291
For the first time for 58 years.
Going to France was incredible.

15:07.480 --> 15:11.485
And for Welsh fans, our fans -
Our fighters, as we call them -

15:11.520 --> 15:13.016
They have been waiting for a long time about this.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.442
I always look at the table
and it's lovely to see...

15:17.480 --> 15:19.642
Do you know, there is no <i> Q </i> in Wales, is it?

15:19.680 --> 15:24.322
But when looking now, there
is <i> Q</i> there and... Wales.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.089
This target has been
with us for so long

15:27.120 --> 15:29.691
And when it happened, it was
more relief than anything

15:29.720 --> 15:32.291
But I had to do nothing

15:32.320 --> 15:35.290
And I always think that there is
enough talent in the squad to do it.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.571
There are many in Wales who thought
they would never see the day.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.649
It is already clear that the decision
to expand the European Championship

15:42.680 --> 15:44.569
It's worth doing it.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.766
Many nations will appear for the
first time ever in the Euro

15:49.280 --> 15:51.328
And we are all sure

15:51.360 --> 15:55.285
This will be a fantastic
tournament for all those involved.

15:55.680 --> 15:59.765
And the first team to be
removed in number one plot.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.765
England.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.169
And at 6l pot one, as we
decided, we're going to bot...

16:09.200 --> 16:10.247
Four.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.925
Wales.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.770
Also for Wales, this is the
first time they took part.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.007
They were there at 58 in the World Cup

16:23.040 --> 16:26.089
And they will play
England, as you can see.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.451
The next tim.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.565
Group 4

16:29.600 --> 16:31.045
England and Wales...

16:31.400 --> 16:32.845
Slovakia.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.765
Russia.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.681
June 2016, Cardiff, Wales.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.770
I remember watching the World Cup.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.531
My first memory is 1978 in Argentina.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.491
And I'm always dreaming
of being in a tournament.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.603
I did not make it as a player,
so Holding was a manager...

17:00.600 --> 17:03.809
Gives the most incredible feeling.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.567
And it's hard to explain

17:07.599 --> 17:11.366
For someone who has not been through everything
we have as a nation has been through it.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.415
Where it was something
we've ever wanted.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.648
And he had... Yes. Incredible

17:16.680 --> 17:19.330
Dinard, Brittany, France.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.881
Tim Cymru Home (Center)

17:26.640 --> 17:29.849
We deserve all this place here

17:29.880 --> 17:31.484
And all this pressure.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.816
We deserve this. We've been
asking for it for so long.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.605
Now we can not say "Oh,
it's a little bit..."

17:36.640 --> 17:38.688
Here's what we've
been screaming about.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.007
Six months in advance, there
were family and friends

17:48.040 --> 17:50.056
We all know about
their plans and trips

17:50.080 --> 17:51.650
And the money that is spent

17:51.680 --> 17:54.126
And the campers who sell out and
all kinds of things like that

17:54.160 --> 17:56.731
So we started to know how
great this tournament was.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.685
I went to France fory.
Fly to Bordeaux.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.881
I've been stuck with excitement.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.843
That was the wife's words
to me this morning.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.609
"You're a bad mail" she said.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.370
The atmosphere was in France
in Bordeaux and Toulouse

18:08.400 --> 18:10.607
Wherever you go, there
were Welsh people.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.336
They played the Tournament In their hearts

18:12.360 --> 18:15.443
And I think that the story of the
tournament was Welsh supporters.

18:16.640 --> 18:20.486
Bordeaux, June 11th.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.684
Wales vs Slovakia

18:24.720 --> 18:27.849
I woke up to the sound of people
drinking and Singing and shouting.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.484
I can look out of the window

18:29.520 --> 18:31.329
And see them all in the
pub over the road.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.850
(AW) / amazing incredible.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.722
Jonny Owen, who has been on his own
Tour de France, follows Wales.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.169
How many people do you think
will go, tickets or not?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.696
It's a once-in-life trip, somehow.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.202
Everyone I know I'm going
into football is going.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.162
Everyone.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.096
So I'll walk down the high
street in Bordeaux...

18:50.120 --> 18:52.856
It'll be like Merthyr's high street
there, I think, as I walk there.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.440
So when we travel to the g...

18:55.480 --> 18:57.776
And know that we want to reach
the city, reach Bordeaux

18:57.800 --> 18:59.404
And goes to feel it.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.845
I did not really hurt me
before that, I did not think,

19:02.880 --> 19:05.850
We're really going to
be in a big tournament.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.327
There were thousands of
people around the bus.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.008
Screaming us
Wants the best for us.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.365
There were only red shirts...
Taffs everywhere.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.851
It was incredible.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.566
I really do not want to go to work.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.082
I want to wait and
drink the beer...

19:26.320 --> 19:29.216
We have had good crowds at home, and
the lovers have traveled with us

19:29.240 --> 19:31.607
But France was different.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.056
We know there is a difficult test to come

19:33.080 --> 19:37.130
Against Slovakia's very strong team,
who will probably be favorites,

19:37.160 --> 19:40.846
<i>Alas, you know cm, they're not good.</i>

19:41.120 --> 19:43.040
They Have been Getting
Excellent Results.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.203
<i>And if you grow cm to the
four teams in the group,</i>

19:45.240 --> 19:46.456
We are not the least likely to Sign.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.927
It is still necessary to look
around and enjoy the environment

19:49.960 --> 19:52.201
<i>Alas, it sounds something,
do you know cm?</i>

19:52.520 --> 19:55.091
It means we have
reached a tournament.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.284
And we need to appreciate that.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.005
He talked about that gale for months.
Honno was the first.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.283
The name 'Slovakia' would be
thrown to you ever and ever.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.410
When you sensed that
excitement, the look forward.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.576
Did you know, we were standing
in the corridor, listening

20:08.600 --> 20:11.683
And it was some kind of surreal.
Unbelievable feeling.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.576
And I remember remembering the players.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.160
Sometimes this can
have an effect.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.888
But there was no sign
of that on ours.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.320
I knew we did not beat, knowing
that we would be performing.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.776
Obviously, I've had experience
of big games before

20:26.800 --> 20:28.165
And large outbuildings outside

20:28.200 --> 20:29.856
And it was one of those
feelings again huge.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.565
The atmosphere up there was high.

20:32.600 --> 20:37.288
If you're playing for Real Madrid,
every week is a circus, is not it?

20:38.240 --> 20:40.971
Every man he walks, one
of these is in his face

20:41.000 --> 20:42.570
And squares everywhere.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.604
Some of our players play
in the Championship.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.249
And one or two have been
playing just below that.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.736
So they will not
have used it all.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.889
So it's nice to have someone
like that on the other peg

20:53.920 --> 20:58.608
With all the attention and all the pressure.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.522
He was a positive presence
to be around him.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.723
He did not show any
nerves at any time.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.250
He also had great pressure.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.204
I think everyone gets
rid of the fans' energy

21:09.840 --> 21:12.127
And look forward to the gém

21:12.160 --> 21:14.242
And well, what happened
then was incredible.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.601
I still have a cheese skin
when thinking about that now.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.136
On arrival, we went
out to warm up

21:18.160 --> 21:20.527
And before you see a large amount of red.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.416
I think everyone who is
interviewed for this will be

21:27.440 --> 21:30.284
At the time of the anthem in Bordeaux.
How emotional it was.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.211
That's when we came to understand what was
really important for the Welsh people.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.483
If it's possible to press
'pause', and stay in that moment,

22:55.520 --> 22:56.965
You would be there forever.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.446
Hamé was a good player.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.576
And we said "Look, here's what it does.
It's very dangerous."

23:23.600 --> 23:27.002
He will receive the buck here, he
will attack the edge of the box...

23:28.080 --> 23:29.656
We worked on that for
two or three days

23:29.680 --> 23:33.162
And within 30 seconds, he did
exactly what we worked on.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.764
Defenders fly Everywhere.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.242
Ben Davies kisses the breeze.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.408
Did you know, it could have
been very different for us.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.641
And then, we settled
quickly into the game.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.123
You either love international
football and the experience

23:52.160 --> 23:54.242
0 represent your
country, and hi-

23:54.280 --> 23:56.169
Understand what it means -

23:56.200 --> 23:57.486
Or you are not.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.488
There is no such thing as
life somewhere in the middle.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.120
In Iwc, one of the world's
best players with us -

24:03.160 --> 24:04.685
Who understands it to nothing.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.883
That's the moment, I think,
we've all been waiting for it.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.243
The noise levels went through the roof.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.364
And it was like... here's us.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.880
This is what it is.
This is what we always want.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.521
We felt the tournament had
really started for us.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.329
They're definitely stronger than us.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.696
We can not get out of our half.
We're too deep.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.643
We caught 1-1 here.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.284
They became equal

25:02.320 --> 25:04.800
And you think "No, come 0
no, can we hold hold?"

25:05.920 --> 25:07.763
Well, here's 70 minutes

25:07.800 --> 25:09.325
And the boots are tired.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.776
Hard games, of course, against
some of the world's best players

25:11.800 --> 25:13.656
Then hear the anthem
being sung by the fans

25:13.680 --> 25:15.456
And that gives you the
extra 10% for you.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.776
I've been fortunate to play
football for a long time now.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.486
I've never seen a connection
between the team and a set of fans

25:21.520 --> 25:22.576
As it was in the first gém sma-

25:22.600 --> 25:23.976
He wanted us to go up the field.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.401
We want to go behind
to protect Slovakia.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.171
Hal came on the pitch,
we got Joe Ledley on.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.085
And as he works...

25:31.120 --> 25:33.043
It was a straight move
from the practice field.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.696
In that system, we try to get one
side to the other as much as we can

25:35.720 --> 25:37.324
To move the other team around.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.643
Pass through by Joe Ledley.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.336
Great guy, for the perfect player
you would want in that situation

25:42.360 --> 25:44.169
Who does not think twice

25:59.520 --> 26:02.524
The way we slipped to
the corner corner.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.407
That was a tremendous experience.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.843
And then the atmosphere on the
field with all the players,

26:11.880 --> 26:15.327
With the fans, have gone
up another level yet.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.922
You senses the relief,
the excitement.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.530
That feeling...

26:21.560 --> 26:24.245
"We're going to win our first team
in the European Championship."

26:34.200 --> 26:36.885
He scored early in the game
and went on to win her

26:36.920 --> 26:38.365
In a very difficult gém -

26:38.400 --> 26:40.084
Full emotion -

26:40.120 --> 26:43.249
Shows that this gr \
7'vp is very special.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.131
And there was not
going to be enough.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.407
We talked about the fact -
And repeat that

26:54.440 --> 26:56.363
And we thought it was
not a stereotype,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.243
To draw attention from England -

26:58.280 --> 27:00.169
The first gém is
in the tournament.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.521
If you can win that,
especially in a group phrase

27:02.560 --> 27:06.087
You set yourself perfectly to remove
weight from the rest of the games.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.084
Have things changed?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.963
The fact that you are on top of the grv "vp.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.287
Having three points, that
England has one point.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.846
Has that changed your
preparations at all?

27:15.880 --> 27:17.256
The way you think about the gém?

27:17.280 --> 27:18.167
(No) '-

27:18.200 --> 27:21.124
Group B, English opponents
have just been removed...

27:21.160 --> 27:22.127
Lens, June 16th

27:22.160 --> 27:24.686
- and... they are Wales.
- Wales vs England.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.643
Ho-ho! That's yours!

27:26.680 --> 27:29.490
England vs. Wales Come on!

27:29.680 --> 27:31.967
I was born and brought up in Swansea.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.562
Do you know, Welshman?

27:34.600 --> 27:36.443
So there's something about England.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.570
Anything about them in sports...
I want to beat England.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.282
In leading to the grv games,
England was everything.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.891
That's all the people were talking about.
Gém England, gém England...

27:46.920 --> 27:48.896
And what's going to happen
and who's going to win

27:48.920 --> 27:50.365
A honna fydd gém y grv'vp.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.607
I worried about the attention, the scrutiny.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.168
The big picture. Everything
that matches the tournament.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.329
And could we cope.
It was something new for us.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.964
It was a circus, the gém then.
Real.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.163
It was... Everything she came with
and all for 90 minutes of football.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.929
Things will be said.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.691
There will be a lot of going and coming.

28:09.640 --> 28:13.326
And in fact, it does not
matter who says what, why...

28:13.360 --> 28:16.887
When the whistle is blown, that's
when the important questions...

28:17.160 --> 28:19.056
Are Required and You have to
make sure you have the answers.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.560
Get enough points to go through.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.726
That's all that was important.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.246
Gém England was the second of three giants.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.203
And that's how we look at it.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.402
I think our boys enjoy it

28:30.440 --> 28:33.250
That the media in England
publishes everything we say

28:33.560 --> 28:35.688
And then complains to us.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.529
England is elevating themselves.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.562
Angry, pride, patriotism.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.576
You said that all, and
of you really think it

28:45.600 --> 28:50.447
And are you surprised by the way, some
of the English squad could have bite?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.640
I saw the interview with Ballet -
He was laughing

28:55.040 --> 28:58.044
The media are going to try to put
words in his mouth at times.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.416
How many 0 players would England
get in the current Welsh house?

29:00.440 --> 29:01.680
Not one

29:02.600 --> 29:05.171
It is a huge statement.
We're a small country.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.976
There are not many players
with us to choose from

29:07.000 --> 29:09.096
And there is some feeling that we are
not against the world, do you know?

29:09.120 --> 29:11.009
So that under siege.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.481
And that's what we have with us.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.205
We knew the press was going
to ask such questions

29:15.240 --> 29:16.969
So we mean...

29:17.240 --> 29:19.004
Why not do it a bit for them

29:19.040 --> 29:21.566
And why not say it as it is.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.696
I never said they had
no passion or pride.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.769
But I feel, in my opinion,
that there is more with us.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.691
I can not miss It, in fact, who
takes their cornerbikes and so on.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.449
We all say in what was "We
want to play for Wales.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.403
We're a proud Welshman. "

29:38.640 --> 29:41.405
Not a matter of not respecting England -
They're not great!

29:41.440 --> 29:45.604
It was as if people were either loving
or kissing the way we responded

29:45.640 --> 29:47.324
But he worked right for us.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.056
There was something a bit
of being on that one.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.684
Since this was the middle of the group "vp.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.056
We know how hard
it is for Wales.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.651
If you are England, you had the
pressure in the tournament.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.010
We could feel the
pressure on them.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.008
We can feel it.
It was incredible.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.889
I really look forward to it.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.816
I think, you know,
this would be the time

30:14.840 --> 30:17.127
That we would beat them.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.656
I remember coming in on the
half, and we had one gang ahead

30:43.680 --> 30:45.330
Against England in the Euro

30:45.360 --> 30:46.566
And yet there was some feeling

30:46.600 --> 30:48.216
We are not really happy with
the way we are performing

30:48.240 --> 30:50.925
And we know, unless
things get better

30:50.960 --> 30:52.336
And we started to play better

30:52.360 --> 30:54.124
Then it would come to bite us.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.965
Our guy in the first half
did not probably help us.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.810
I think we have
something to hold on

31:00.840 --> 31:04.925
And the team was thinking
of trying to defend that.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.816
We did not play as we should

31:09.840 --> 31:12.286
And the occasion may have
had a little bit on us.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.131
We sat there with
30 seconds to go

31:38.160 --> 31:40.520
And four points, which are
probably enough to go through.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.281
And then within seconds...

31:46.200 --> 31:47.725
We missed our chance

32:01.240 --> 32:03.846
Late surrender was
difficult to be accepted.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.202
And I'm disappointed that we have
not shown England how good we are.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.651
We did not put everything in it.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.216
I always look at myself first.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.056
I think I should have worked
differently through the week.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.889
It could be my messages to the players

32:20.920 --> 32:24.049
Give too much emphasis on fighting and
not enough to express themselves.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.650
It was a terrible feeling.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.456
One of the worst I've
got in football.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.416
I do not think it was the fact
that we lost in the last minute.

32:29.440 --> 32:33.729
But we have not shown what
we can do, as we should.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.966
Be the promotion before scoring

32:38.000 --> 32:40.128
We looked at the screen to see the time

32:40.160 --> 32:41.736
And I think it was
two minutes to go.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.080
Of course, she was 1-1 at the time.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.366
The people in the midst of
Welsh supporters were crying.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.009
Did I think unless
I was a player

32:49.040 --> 32:52.567
I suppose I would be in that
crowd with the fans anyway

32:52.600 --> 32:55.331
And something may have
come over to I think

32:55.560 --> 32:59.121
And to give a message somehow saying
"Come there, keep your heads Ian"

32:59.160 --> 33:00.844
Because it's not over.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.291
<i>Though it's been now</i>

33:02.320 --> 33:03.896
There is another guy with
us again in a few days.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.445
"You still need you."

33:08.480 --> 33:11.600
As soon as the England team finished
after the final whistle, we had lost

33:11.800 --> 33:13.404
It did not matter That was over.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.408
It's all gone.
Only Russia counts.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.771
We went away from the hotel

33:16.800 --> 33:18.962
We did not reach the field of practice

33:19.000 --> 33:21.082
We went to the beach
and got a bit to eat

33:21.120 --> 33:22.645
And the spirit was good.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.650
I asked, how long did
you talk about England?

33:25.680 --> 33:27.011
Or, to paraphrase,

33:27.040 --> 33:29.520
How long are you
talking about England?

33:29.720 --> 33:31.051
What is England?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.809
He was telling volumes
about the players

33:32.840 --> 33:35.081
That they can handle
that situation

33:36.120 --> 33:39.169
And then put it
aside, insulate it

33:39.200 --> 33:42.443
And say "Next, Russia is next."

33:54.000 --> 33:56.162
It showed the other side of the team.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.727
Worst we've dealt with
it worse than that,

33:59.760 --> 34:01.569
So we know the group is strong.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.604
People will always say that
each team draws together

34:04.640 --> 34:06.369
But there's something special with us here

34:06.400 --> 34:09.483
Where there are boys from different
backgrounds and everything

34:09.520 --> 34:11.248
But everyone clicks.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.369
From the hell!

34:14.400 --> 34:16.482
Do it Do it

34:16.520 --> 34:18.656
Many of us have grown
up together too

34:18.679 --> 34:20.250
Has come through a fairly
similar age group.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.931
This is what we always
want to make children.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.726
Now play at the highest
level together

34:26.760 --> 34:30.481
Have fun, enjoy it, that's
what we all want to do.

34:32.560 --> 34:36.042
This generation -
And Ramseys, and Bales -

34:36.080 --> 34:38.081
All in grv "vp similar age

34:38.120 --> 34:40.360
And they would have started
with a mini football.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.085
Youth games with primary
school children,

34:43.120 --> 34:45.360
Move away from having 11
players on a huge field

34:45.400 --> 34:47.447
To a very heavy blade

34:47.480 --> 34:49.696
And try to kick the ball as hard
as you can to one direction

34:49.719 --> 34:51.005
Rather than pass it.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.884
I think that has given
us a foundation

34:53.920 --> 34:55.416
Where we can help players
to go and play football.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.204
Because we like to pass the bolt.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.361
There are young players in Britain

35:03.400 --> 35:08.167
It does not have so much time with
the belt and maybe Spanish Players.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.521
And much of that is the result
of the weather and resources.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.976
We do not want to train and do
not want to work with them -

35:13.000 --> 35:16.482
We can not, because there is no room for
us to play - the fields are not with us.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.363
You improve young players by
giving them better facilities

35:23.400 --> 35:27.166
And get coaches who want
to move on as coaches.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.851
If you keep them early and
work better with them

35:29.880 --> 35:31.530
There will be a better chance with you.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.325
The key is to see Trail
To the first team.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.936
In some soccer clubs
and in some countries,

35:35.960 --> 35:37.336
You probably can not see that

35:37.360 --> 35:39.124
Or you long years away.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.536
But in Wales, I
think you could see

35:40.560 --> 35:42.927
If you do well in the
under 21s or under 19s

35:42.960 --> 35:45.008
Or even at Victory Shield level

35:45.040 --> 35:46.485
There was a fast track to be

35:46.520 --> 35:49.126
Where Wales was not afraid to
throw you into the deep end

35:49.160 --> 35:51.527
No matter how young you are.
We saw that with Gareth.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.164
It is beginning to show now

35:53.200 --> 35:57.046
That we started
about ten years ago

35:57.080 --> 36:00.687
Bear fruit and we
see the results.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.296
Clearly he started under Gary
Speed, going to the foundations

36:03.320 --> 36:05.496
And make things more
professional around Wales

36:05.520 --> 36:08.569
And then obviously, this boss
came in and did incredible things

36:08.600 --> 36:12.241
And I think we started
to get things better

36:12.280 --> 36:13.884
And the spirit of the team is improving too.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.160
Things have turned into many

36:15.200 --> 36:18.682
Where players want to come and join
the Welsh squad even with injuries.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.963
And that's where we are now. And
Chris has moved things forward

36:22.440 --> 36:28.163
And has created the best environment
that has any international interest.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.456
There's a motto - Together Stronger -
Stronger Together.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.448
It comes from the fact that the players are

36:32.480 --> 36:36.610
And the staff have been in
very difficult situations

36:36.640 --> 36:38.165
Where we were there

36:38.200 --> 36:40.328
And wait together and
come through it.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.921
Do not go out for a couple of beints
and have fun at work that does it.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.247
That's easy, but it's
just five minutes.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.409
All the other things, when you've
been in very difficult situations,

36:50.120 --> 36:52.566
And people do not turn their
back on that situation -

36:52.600 --> 36:54.250
Do not turn your back on you

36:54.280 --> 36:57.682
I'm always a fan of Ash a
Rambo a Balo and Joe Allen.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.411
There are other players
that are so important.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.408
Did you know, your Joe
Ledleys, your Andy Kings

37:03.440 --> 37:05.408
Your Sam Vokes, Simon Church...

37:05.440 --> 37:08.683
Chris Gunter has about 70 caps.
Unbelievable

37:09.320 --> 37:10.560
Lawn, met?

37:13.960 --> 37:16.964
Here's how to play with
a £ 90 million player.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.800
I can go all of them all.
They're always there.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.531
They do not miss games.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.483
Sometimes you do not play

37:24.520 --> 37:26.204
But they always play an important part

37:26.240 --> 37:27.730
And they're huge.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.056
But they run the changing room.
I do not run the room.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.320
It is their room changing them.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.125
<i>The boys who have not reached the
field or who do not have a gém,</i>

37:34.160 --> 37:35.924
You know, they're going to go

37:35.960 --> 37:38.406
And they're not very happy they
have not been on the field

37:38.440 --> 37:39.726
And I like that.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.001
The intuitive response is
sorry you're not playing

37:42.040 --> 37:43.769
But then there is no point
of puffing about that

37:43.800 --> 37:45.723
Because you can not change
the mind of the manager.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.161
You need to be there and you
have to try and help the boys

37:48.200 --> 37:51.363
And get the boys to relax
for such big games.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.882
The days before Russia
were very positive, right

37:54.920 --> 37:57.256
When many people expected
him to be a negative time.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.931
It was a good time, I think,

37:59.960 --> 38:02.296
To try to get over the loss against
England as soon as possible

38:02.320 --> 38:03.896
For I do not feel we've
played so badly that,

38:03.920 --> 38:06.161
But there was a loss,
especially in the last minute,

38:06.200 --> 38:07.770
Has cast us hard.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.336
But I think that making sure that
everyone sings from the same sheet

38:10.360 --> 38:12.376
And still ready to go, it's
everything to play for,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.051
Definitely got help...

38:16.200 --> 38:17.964
My hands are free!

38:18.440 --> 38:20.886
No, no, no, it's not too much.
Only 80.

38:23.920 --> 38:27.003
This is the best time of your life. You
do not realize that, but it's true.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.481
Exit and express yourself, enjoy
and enjoy the experience.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.126
You know your reign.
You know what to do.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.643
You're a good player, or
you would not be here.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.887
That was a real turning
point for us, when we said.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.207
OK, what's the matter?
We've just lost England.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.056
It was huge giant but we
were still in a position

38:41.080 --> 38:42.656
Where we know, if we win,
we will pass through.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.444
We would have received
that beforehand.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.642
So it's not black all.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.330
That must be given to the manager for that.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.761
And the psychologist and
all the staff around us.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.656
Why did we pick us up after
that day against England...

38:52.680 --> 38:54.736
<i>Aches that the group is honest,
that group then 0 players.</i>

38:54.760 --> 38:56.896
When we're losing and not playing
well, the players feel to live.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.924
When you're in the squad's
camp, it's hard. Very hard.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.007
Very serious.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.849
But at the same time, they enjoy

39:02.880 --> 39:05.451
Because they respect each other

39:05.480 --> 39:07.096
And because they have the knot
that holds them together.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.120
- Can you do that all day?
- We can. I would not go a long way.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.288
In this way, all the way.
Down the wing.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.760
- Bamboo protection.
- Bamboo?

39:16.800 --> 39:18.325
Good word, bamboo.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.416
We tend to forget that the
players are human beings

39:20.440 --> 39:23.091
And they have to enjoy
this experience too.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.056
They all enjoy playing
football over their country.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.240
Sometimes we put too
much pressure on them.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.651
Toulouse 20th June.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.409
Wales vs Russia.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.056
We made the video, we did the game
for the tournament with the boys

39:37.080 --> 39:39.560
<i>and</i> we did the video with
the team sex two months ago

39:39.600 --> 39:40.816
<i>and </i> we can say at the time.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.656
Do you know, I'm getting
a chat with Joe Allen

39:42.680 --> 39:44.976
Saying that I think his new
hair is a grievan <i> and</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:46.843
<i>and </i> we laugh and pull legs

39:47.280 --> 39:49.851
And you could say that there was
a special knot between them.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.120
Immediately.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.296
And by the end of the video, they
jumped Ian and down with them.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.800
I looked at Rocky -
Rocky IV, yes? With the Russians? - -

39:55.840 --> 39:58.161
During the day, and that
was a good preparation.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.096
I think that many of the
boots have watched that.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.776
Curious, in fact, a case
when going in to her,

40:01.800 --> 40:04.963
Many of us felt it was possible
that this was a final gém

40:05.000 --> 40:08.243
The tournament if things did not go from
our party, so it had motivated everyone.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.496
You can not decide what the
result will be, somehow.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.522
Whatever the outcome will come.

40:12.560 --> 40:15.530
You can decide how you want
the performance to be.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.564
In our changing room, we knew
we could beat this team.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.776
If we go out of the tournament

40:19.800 --> 40:21.296
We can not go out on our
terms, play in our way.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.256
We knew exactly what
we wanted to do.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.280
Go for it.

40:48.800 --> 40:52.646
From the first whistle...
All fell for your place.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.006
You can not sit on the side
of the field as a coach

40:58.040 --> 40:59.929
And watch the team playing

40:59.960 --> 41:01.291
And enjoy real.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.480
I think the performance is one of the
best with anyone in the Welsh shirt.

41:04.840 --> 41:08.287
It's easy to talk, but showing what
we can do is the difficult piece.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.696
I looked at the boys on
my head and I thought.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.576
"This is not good.
These are good players. "

41:13.600 --> 41:16.080
Especially the way the lead
players attacked in the gém.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.046
We're going for those passes
that do not work sometimes.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.686
If you do not offer them,
you will never know.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.644
Joe Allen gets the ball in <6l...

41:25.680 --> 41:29.765
Play her through Aaron Ramsey,
who is not hostile... Ramsey!

41:30.680 --> 41:33.286
Wales 1, Russia no!

41:34.280 --> 41:36.123
Gareth Bale has some space.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.456
Players on his left, and he wants
to try to use Neil Taylor.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.801
Taylor is in!
Opportunity to get the second for Wales!

41:40.840 --> 41:42.046
The keeper saves!

41:42.080 --> 41:43.969
Taylor's second offer!

41:44.000 --> 41:45.570
Make it two!

41:51.040 --> 41:53.725
Chris Gunter is on my side
I, the side of the bench.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.566
It plays great.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.684
He turned to me and said.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.041
"Enjoy this, boss, because this
does not happen frequently."

42:00.080 --> 42:02.128
And here I think, you know...

42:02.160 --> 42:05.243
Everything in that particular
thing depends on it.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.130
Ramsey leaves him to Chris Gunter

42:07.160 --> 42:09.731
Who can knock towards a
Russian penalty box.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.001
He puts it to Ramsey
near the edge of the D.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.725
He has options in the box...
Ballet is one of them!

42:23.960 --> 42:26.247
- Bale!
- That's us!

42:26.720 --> 42:28.848
- That's the third!
- That's us!

42:29.120 --> 42:33.205
Finally, Gareth Bale
is getting it tonight!

42:33.240 --> 42:35.641
Three gels in three gém gr \ 7'vp!

42:36.000 --> 42:39.402
The last 16, they are coming!

42:39.440 --> 42:41.886
Wales 3, Russia no

42:41.920 --> 42:45.049
And it was almost inevitable
that this is the man again.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.764
Gareth Bale!

42:52.840 --> 42:56.242
I want to make sure that
everyone knows who Wales is

42:56.280 --> 42:58.044
And what we can do.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.296
We can only imagine
how she was in Wales.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.845
I would have liked to be there myself.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.769
The celebrations at
that time were a chorus

43:03.800 --> 43:05.086
Because it had finished at the top

43:05.120 --> 43:07.964
And could say that it was
not my best in that group

43:08.000 --> 43:11.447
Unbelievable. And it was a dream.
It was a huge dream for us.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.961
He often felt that if all
of Wales were there.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.651
It was unreal that so many
people were out there

43:16.680 --> 43:20.082
But you know, we are very
proud of our supporters.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.202
Not just in the stadiums,
outside the stadiums.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.766
It was as if everyone
loved Welsh fans there

43:24.800 --> 43:27.451
And we left France a good
impression, I think.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.176
Wherever we went, we see them
in their numbers. Hearing them.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.976
"Do not Take Me Home"
Wherever you turn.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.889
All the players sing
at the hotel...

43:33.920 --> 43:35.524
The thing was infectious

43:35.560 --> 43:38.040
Because people are there
to enjoy themselves.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.165
Seeing such support gives
you an extra boost.

43:42.560 --> 43:46.281
My Mets In 0 Merthyr, drink red wine
for the first time in their lives.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.808
They thought it was a vinegar.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.769
We're in France, enjoying...

43:50.800 --> 43:52.336
What's next?
I'm going to Toulouse now.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.840
How do I go to get there?
I do not, but I'll arrive.

43:57.840 --> 44:01.811
Wales is successful in reaching the final
of the 16th as winners of the grv'vp.

44:01.840 --> 44:06.289
The Germany, England, Spain and their
like are the big countries all

44:06.320 --> 44:08.084
Going on to the other half games.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.681
So you have to see this as a great
opportunity to go ahead, possibly,

44:11.720 --> 44:13.210
Much more in the tournament.

44:13.240 --> 44:16.244
It does not matter who comes out
of the hat, she'll be hard.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.328
I think, because of
what is at stake,

44:19.720 --> 44:23.441
You live on your emotion
much of the time.

44:23.840 --> 44:26.525
- <i> ♪ </i> To save the national team.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.656

44:37.680 --> 44:40.286
Here we are - Paris.
Y Parc des Princes.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.847
Euro 2016.

44:43.360 --> 44:46.603
Wales vs. Northern Ireland.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.051
It was a hot day in Paris.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.811
He was a hard man.
Two things are well organized.

44:51.760 --> 44:54.496
There was sometimes a feeling, a
little, of you getting from the fans,

44:54.520 --> 44:59.082
For the first time, we are happy
to be here, enjoy the experience

44:59.120 --> 45:01.043
But we're not the favorites.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.771
We need to go through it.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.610
Yet, there is an expectation after we
came through the first three teams

45:05.640 --> 45:08.962
Where people did not expect
us to perform or... you know.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.840
I think one or two have said the
basin we do well To score a gel.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.164
So we came through that.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.726
And we are not the team that
we expect to go through here.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.131
The pressure, almost, could be felt
in the stadium from both sides

45:22.160 --> 45:23.536
Because it was somewhere
we had not been before.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.971
And following Russia

45:25.000 --> 45:26.920
Everyone was expecting us to
have another guy like that.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.042
Football is not like that.
She is never like that.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.129
This was our most expensive gém.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.647
Some people will find
it odd that I say so.

45:39.200 --> 45:44.047
I felt the nerves and
everyone on bins.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.891
<i>Em hafined pinnacles.</i>

45:45.920 --> 45:48.207
Even the Red Wall
felt that on the day.

45:49.960 --> 45:53.726
They've had a great unfailing run
when I go into the tournament.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.526
There were not many since we played them

45:56.560 --> 45:58.210
And I think it was 1-1 equal

45:58.240 --> 46:00.049
So we knew it would be a battle.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.640
They do not surrender goals easily.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.202
They're ready to sit
alone and I'm sorry.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.160
They've definitely done
their homework with us.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.770
And we're on them.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.449
We are really in our preparations.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.336
We knew we would
have to do our best

46:13.360 --> 46:16.170
And that there were very few opportunities.

46:18.640 --> 46:22.008
They will defend in a low block
that will not be enough there.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.610
The space will be before them

46:23.640 --> 46:25.802
And they'll let us get the ball.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.496
I've been in that
situation before

46:32.520 --> 46:34.216
Where you have to
continue, be patient.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.129
Move the ball as fast as you can.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.611
She was different.

46:38.640 --> 46:39.976
Tim is not trying
to score against us

46:40.000 --> 46:42.207
But a team trying to
stop us from scoring

46:42.560 --> 46:44.640
Therefore, that was a
problem for us for periods.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.656
It was not easy to play at all.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.096
We do not want to throw too
much in while going on

46:52.120 --> 46:53.804
And: Then Be caught
by anti-assault

46:53.840 --> 46:56.411
Because that's their own.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.761
They are firm in the back,
and make things hard.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.961
They were more comfortable
than we were in the gém.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.684
Their plan worked.

47:08.720 --> 47:11.849
So at half we said "With a look.
They do this for every team. "

47:11.880 --> 47:13.564
There will be a gel in it.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.807
Little luck perhaps,
with us or them.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.040
Make sure that it will be with us.
Wait in the gém.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.883
She looked like it would have an extra
time, possibly kicking off the spots.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.646
We knew, with Gareth and
Aaron and Hal before

47:33.680 --> 47:35.648
We would have the opportunity.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.369
He got Rambo the bél and
played a little one with Hal

47:39.400 --> 47:41.209
Then slip it over to Balo.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.522
The whole stadium was exploded.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.848
We felt relief.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.656
It helps when you have players
that can create miracles

48:01.680 --> 48:03.330
And of course, Gaz did.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.560
And I think that the way the gel came
to reflect it was the kind of thing

48:07.840 --> 48:09.922
And the kind of performance
we needed from us.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.648
There was not much between the two.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.967
We had to answer a different
question in that guy.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.680
In Paris, in the stadium where
I've ever wanted to play.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.448
I remember trying to move from the way.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.524
But I did hit it with a fool

48:29.560 --> 48:31.608
And it was like a big
car crash, in fact.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.449
My shoulder was injured.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.005
It was about eight minutes ago.

48:35.400 --> 48:38.200
I wanted to complete the task -
I felt I could do it.

48:38.240 --> 48:40.288
But of course, I'm in a lot of pain.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.163
It's a rock, the captain,

48:42.200 --> 48:45.124
Everyone everyone looks
at when a voice is needed

48:45.160 --> 48:47.003
And leads by example on the field.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.936
It puts its body on the
line, as you can see,

48:48.960 --> 48:51.008
Will he not want to leave
the field in any gém.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.406
Looking back, that might
not be the right decision.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.603
It's sometimes hard at the gém.

48:57.640 --> 49:01.087
You are in the middle of things
and do not think clearly.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.280
North luck fans were screaming.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.768
I think they felt that there was
an opportunity with them here.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.886
Of all our sports games, the
gém then lasted longer.

49:29.960 --> 49:34.488
The same guy was for its own
net but for us, it was huge.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.807
And then going on, of course,
I'm in the Quarters.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.136
For us, we came through because
we had a player on the field

49:40.160 --> 49:41.650
Who could make the difference.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.889
When we came through and won
the gém, it was fantastic.

49:47.600 --> 49:48.976
He had to share the
whole with the families

49:49.000 --> 49:51.367
And the children come on
the field then incredibly

49:51.400 --> 49:54.131
And definitely worth the fine
from the Football Association.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.807
We've taken too many hours
of work, spent too much,

50:01.840 --> 50:04.241
But does not matter? No.
Cause us in the quarters

50:05.960 --> 50:08.804
Joe Allen...
I read on Facebook...

50:09.800 --> 50:12.121
Water is over two
thirds of the world.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.128
Joe Allen goes over the rest.

50:14.800 --> 50:15.926
And that is the case.

50:34.320 --> 50:37.130
How do you keep fresh?
It's a long tournament...

50:37.160 --> 50:40.721
Yes, it's a shame that here but even
for the players, it can become boring.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.161
You can mentally bother.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.202
How do you stop that?

50:45.240 --> 50:46.605
It was important to us

50:46.640 --> 50:49.041
Get the right environment from the beginning

50:49.080 --> 50:54.564
Because neither of us had any
expectations or information

50:54.600 --> 50:57.400
About "it's how things in a
tournament would have come true.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.689
Two Ben Davies.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.844
- And one Jonny Williams.
- Behind my face.

51:02.880 --> 51:05.326
We're a family.
It was like living together.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.056
We lived together for six weeks.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.206
Barod?

51:10.520 --> 51:11.851
In it you

51:13.640 --> 51:15.483
What do you both do?

51:18.360 --> 51:20.761
I can see your reflection
behind me, go...

51:21.400 --> 51:24.768
The boots get as good as possible, it was
not difficult to be together for so long.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.165
We enjoyed every minute.

51:26.600 --> 51:27.776
So be on holiday with
you all the time.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.723
Be on holiday and
enjoy the occasion

51:29.760 --> 51:32.127
We make quizzes all the time,

51:32.160 --> 51:33.400
Play table tennis,

51:33.440 --> 51:34.885
The "Qwylio games,

51:34.920 --> 51:37.600
We do everything together.
We get a round of golf.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.603
I get a cramp in my arm.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.729
The hotel was the place to relax.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.889
To eat, sleep, play
table tennis...

51:46.920 --> 51:48.331
Darts...

51:48.360 --> 51:51.443
The youngest boys played on
the Playstations or the Xbox

51:51.480 --> 51:52.891
Or whatever.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.656
The fact that we enjoy
spending so much time together

51:55.680 --> 51:57.284
Really help in the time off

51:57.320 --> 51:59.129
When other teams would
be bored, could.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.606
I think the standard of table
tennis has improved tremendously

52:01.640 --> 52:04.564
From the beginning to the end of the tournament.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.409
The rest of the staff were rather
scared to take a point off the boss.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.209
- He thinks he's a good player.
- Oh, it's terrible!

52:15.240 --> 52:16.969
Hwre!

52:17.760 --> 52:19.842
- Echrydus.
- They're on it all the time.

52:19.880 --> 52:21.928
- When we can not get a while, from us?
- No.

52:21.960 --> 52:26.204
Trying to keep 23 players
happy and part of things

52:26.240 --> 52:29.289
For four to five weeks I
always went to be a challenge.

52:30.800 --> 52:34.327
Wales is the only one of the Home
Nations that is 6th in Euro 2016.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.442
Northern Ireland is too much out there.

52:36.480 --> 52:40.405
England, well... They did what
they did against Gwlad yr lé.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.681
Surprised Happy? All of the above?

52:43.240 --> 52:45.083
- Penia hi!
- He has to blow.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.605
Penia hi! Penia hi!

52:48.280 --> 52:53.764
Country of England.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.602
I still do not know
how that went out.

53:03.640 --> 53:06.007
Someone has been released
or sent to someone.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.616
And before you turn around,
there's over Twitter all

53:08.640 --> 53:11.689
And when I started having a panic
because I did not believe it.

53:15.080 --> 53:17.048
He came out, and that's us.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.684
There was nothing we could do.

53:21.360 --> 53:23.886
I think that confident
young boys play football,

53:23.920 --> 53:26.048
Enjoying themselves,
away together,

53:26.080 --> 53:27.969
And there is no respect for anyone,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.447
But the fact was that what
happened, when it happened,

53:31.920 --> 53:33.570
Who happened...

53:34.880 --> 53:36.530
They're clapping!
Make the clap!

53:36.800 --> 53:38.802
Make the clap! Make the clap!

53:50.200 --> 53:53.044
I can not describe it properly,
be in that environment

53:53.080 --> 53:55.616
Again, as I say, after playing
for Wales for so long,

53:55.640 --> 53:58.291
<i>Being over 0 was
something unforgettable.</i>

53:58.320 --> 54:01.642
Chris Gunter may lose his
brother's wedding...

54:01.680 --> 54:03.921
Neil Taylor loses Beyoncé
tomorrow's night

54:03.960 --> 54:05.291
And very unhappy about that...

54:05.720 --> 54:06.926
What will you lose?

54:06.960 --> 54:09.167
Or what do you hope you'll lose?

54:09.720 --> 54:12.200
I planned everything to be at
the end of the final, so...

54:14.160 --> 54:16.891
I was the clever one
in the group, I think.

54:17.240 --> 54:20.847
I experience feelings that I
do not know could be felt.

54:20.880 --> 54:22.086
Lille 1st July.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.326
Wales vs. Belgium.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.456
It's stunning. None
of us think it right.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.536
From the perspective of the
experiences you've got in your life,

54:27.560 --> 54:29.164
How does this compare?

54:29.200 --> 54:32.409
My daughter's birth
is equal, I say.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.608
Better than any wedding I've
been in and say I will.

54:41.480 --> 54:42.561
Giant Final.

54:43.600 --> 54:47.889
So... I've just gotten
my baby as she sprayed.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.969
Na! That's John Murray!

54:51.040 --> 54:52.087
John!

54:52.120 --> 54:55.044
John Murray, Ilais 5 Live.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.488
What will it be tonight,
if you see you well, John?

54:57.520 --> 54:59.204
What will she be tonight?

55:00.560 --> 55:02.688
I want to go for...

55:02.720 --> 55:04.768
- Be honest, John.
- Lawn, I want to be honest.

55:04.800 --> 55:08.009
I want to go for 2-1 to Belgium.

55:09.280 --> 55:12.523
As I said, John used
to be a 5 Live voice.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.324
People are better than 0.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.170
That's me John now that you've
gone to Belgrade tonight.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.440
We're over.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.680
- Correct. On top of, Murray.
- I feel awful now.

55:27.440 --> 55:28.976
I think the public
in Belgium think...

55:29.000 --> 55:30.456
When they saw they
went to play Wales,

55:30.480 --> 55:32.496
I'm siv "vr they rub their
hands and think" place. "

55:32.520 --> 55:33.896
Because Belgium was not outstanding.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.968
In number two in the world, I think.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.736
But I think if you had asked
the Belgian players themselves

55:38.760 --> 55:41.525
They may have given a different
look at how they think

55:41.560 --> 55:43.200
Because we've had
good games with them.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.805
And it's been so good.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.886
Nerfus

55:48.640 --> 55:49.766
Full excitement.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.408
I sit here commenting...

55:54.880 --> 55:59.329
Wales in the European
Championship Quarters.

55:59.960 --> 56:02.850
I still can not believe it,
but go ahead of Wales!

56:04.240 --> 56:06.402
I want to suck this atmosphere.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.050
He felt like a girl away from home.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.456
Although we've got a
load of 0 fans then,

56:11.480 --> 56:13.528
The size of the stadium, and the
size of the Felgians were there,

56:13.560 --> 56:15.096
Makes her feel like
a homemade girl.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.963
It was a nice British night -
Rains.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.365
It was a bit cooler.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.125
Belgium began to be strong,
but they are not good

56:23.160 --> 56:25.481
Really great.

56:28.720 --> 56:31.485
They got a couple of opportunities,
a block or two on the line...

56:33.960 --> 56:36.884
Three or four men throw
themselves in front of the ball

56:36.920 --> 56:38.968
And we're still holding it somehow.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.926
Well, sometimes, when playing against
good teams that are good at the bass,

56:45.960 --> 56:48.884
There is a tendency to
sit down and watch them

56:48.920 --> 56:51.287
And say "Yes, they're good
with the ball you're not?"

56:51.320 --> 56:53.760
Rather than stepping in and having
an impact and disturbing them.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.564
In such a big space, the
first hitch is key.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.696
I think most people
think - that's the end

57:15.720 --> 57:20.044
Because we will have to attack -
They'll take advantage of the space behind you.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.045
Well, here's a show that
it is not always the case.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.126
We're knocking on the gém.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.481
From then until the end
of the first 45 minutes,

57:31.520 --> 57:33.204
We're knocking on the gém then.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.606
And there were gaps in the gém,

57:42.640 --> 57:45.530
I looked around thinking "We
got a very good gem here"

57:45.560 --> 57:47.736
And we're pushing these, the
favorites To win the tournament,

57:47.760 --> 57:49.364
"To the best!"

57:49.400 --> 57:51.607
Between the gel and half time

57:51.640 --> 57:54.296
They do not know what to do.
They can not live with us.

57:54.320 --> 57:55.936
We put them under
pressure at the time

57:55.960 --> 57:57.576
And I thought "There's an
opportunity we'll get here."

57:57.600 --> 58:00.729
I've seen Neil Taylor scoring in the Ewros.
He never scored.

58:00.760 --> 58:02.524
So I thought "I'd
like to get a gel!"

58:07.960 --> 58:09.616
He saw Ash running
away, celebrating,

58:09.640 --> 58:11.324
That was great for him.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.488
That could not happen to
anyone better in our team.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.042
That's the fastest
I've seen running!

58:17.080 --> 58:19.731
- His celebration.
- His celebration... it was incredible.

58:19.760 --> 58:22.889
Real-performance performance.
Arising when needed.

58:22.920 --> 58:24.536
He pulled us up from
being under the Belgians

58:24.560 --> 58:25.720
And he gave us on the way.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.529
Half a time, In it,

58:27.960 --> 58:31.043
We are absolutely confident that
we would go on and scoring again.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.720
And I think they knew that too.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.040
We know they're going
for opportunities.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.445
But we're creating opportunities.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.008
I remember the bale
coming through Bale

58:40.040 --> 58:42.281
And I'm on to the box.

58:47.240 --> 58:50.449
I remember standing up looking at
it, before I can see its options.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.928
We all shouted on Him
to pass to Tayles

58:52.960 --> 58:54.530
It was in acres of space, but...

58:55.360 --> 58:58.125
I knew I thought "Hold for a moment.
I could create a little bit of space. "

58:58.640 --> 59:01.610
And he did something I
never expected to do.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.170
My life is certainly sure.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.843
That was the feeling that the guy was there.

59:15.880 --> 59:17.564
It was incredible for
Hal and the team.

59:17.600 --> 59:19.204
He felt that it was possible.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.242
I did. He stopped his way.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.886
The sv "vn, the explosion
that happened at the time...

59:24.840 --> 59:27.923
As I said, only a quarter of the
stadium was Welsh supporters,

59:27.960 --> 59:29.121
But he went mad there.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.366
I would like to sit here and say.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.210
"Bues I drilled that into him for
two or three consecutive days,"

59:34.360 --> 59:35.521
But I do not.

59:39.600 --> 59:43.764
It was likely that we were 25 minutes
away from reaching a semi final.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.768
And they had a moment or two.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.736
We had a break for a
drink, and I got a drink

59:52.760 --> 59:54.649
And Sean tried to
throw gel to Rambo.

59:55.520 --> 59:57.336
As he threw it, Tayles
looked the other way

59:57.360 --> 59:58.856
And he put it on the
side of his head.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.282
The bench then said that that
had somewhat broken the weight,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.696
We have had a chance
to laugh for something

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.722
Because we're very
nervous it's 2-1.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.730
Had we been pushed 6l for
the last ten minutes or so

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.968
And I think it came with a free 2.0.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.886
Chris redirected me to the right

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.296
And I think it's just
five minutes after 6

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.924
And from my mind "I did not cross her!"

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.842
Paid is the cross of the
faithful in Christopher!

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.680
It was not like us
in the last minute.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.766
See, see Sam...

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.440
It was perfect for me to try
to attack, tell the truth.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.610
And when he left his
head, "He goes in!"

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.250
For a bowl, with a tune.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.721
The biggest thing that will keep in
mind is that it was in that corner.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.407
It was all like a wave
that came over our heads.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.569
And they were jest going wild.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.210
Know that we have
two hits ahead here

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.605
And only a couple of
minutes on <i> 6l...</i>

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.926
We want to win the gém.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.850
The best feeling I've ever
had on a football field.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.771
Would you put the world to re-live
the last five minutes than that?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.040
It was all a dream.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.096
It was all a dream that
we turned out like this.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.122
I've played for Wales
for eight years now

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.322
And I've never seen Wales
team playing so well.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.964
I think I had fallen down

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.401
And feeling all the energy
disappearing from my body

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.771
0 on ND in our We.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.651
To beat Belgian, the favorites
of the competition at the time

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.251
And To beat them 3-1
in the Quarters

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.691
Are you going to the final team?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.370
Give you a gém from the Ffeinal.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.767
I'm a man and I do not cry often

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.928
But in the gen-final round. Wales!

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.689
There was no sense at the time.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.451
I remember at 6l y gém and
say this several times.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.606
"What do we do?"

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:10.283
Wales is now the smallest country to
reach a semi-finals in a big tournament.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.810
Yes, we've arrived at a tournament.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.125
That's done.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.776
Can we get out of the group '?
That's done.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.496
Wait for a minute...
We're in the semi-finals

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.682
It's a feeling... Wow.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.324
A great story from your own point of view.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.045
Your contract has run
out on 1st July.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.605
You have no club at the moment.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.564
Has your representative been
busy over the last few days?

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.490
<i>Erm... Do.</i>

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.884
Yes, yes he is.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.568
They were great.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.844
<i>And this is the best time N life.</i>

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.123
Oh I do not expect to see the day.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.328
Wales!

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.566
There is a great party when
Wales is away from home.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.321
Even when failing in the rounds there
is a real spirit among the fans.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.967
And Chris Coleman is at the heart
of that and Gary Speed before that

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.843
Trying to succeed and FA Wales.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.451
FA Wales has been great in
creating the atmosphere

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.723
So we're a great
family watching Wales.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.136
We certainly could
not handle it all.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.216
Because we were not in the
cities out in France either

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.242
Apart from the games...

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.806
Dinard was a quiet town.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.724
None of us realized how
excitement was home.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.331
Speaking to my wife, he said
everyone was in the village

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.885
Wip the red dragon from their windows

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.446
And everyone watched the
gém, and left work early.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.448
We heard about the support parks

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.721
And, before the first day
everyone was saying, like.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.091
"There will be no one"

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.691
But to see the videos at 6pm

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.087
It all gave you a backbone.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.407
He saw all drinks
thrown into the air

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.091
And everyone celebrates.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.601
People who did not follow
football tell the truth

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.211
Surely with all.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.247
You did not realize how
much the effect was at home

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.964
And how wild it was all.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.176
When watching the support parks
the numbers grow and grow

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.850
<i>And everyone in Wales
below the sire.</i>

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.006
He was a chorus

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.327
But where we were
we were very quiet.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.364
Since when have you
been in France?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.243
When did the tournament start?

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.520
I do not remember. 10th?

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.927
Six months ago, yes?
Tenth June, yes?

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.042
Over for the first gém.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.521
Do not worry.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.776
We went to Toulouse for
England in the morning

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.689
And the ydo zone zone closed?

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.402
But we saw the gém in a bar
called the Four Monkeys.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.576
For Ireland we were in the
supporters part of Ireland.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.728
Great, special supporters.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.283
So that was an
incredible experience.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.641
And here's here
and you're around

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.763
And all the squad
walks past my cream!

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.881
Could not hide it!

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.331
It was better than
all our hopes.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.242
And this has crowned all yndo?

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.656
So thanks, bois. No problem.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.841
Thank you very much.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.850
- Lyon 6th July, Wales v Portugal.
- They have succeeded incredibly

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.882
Better than any
rugby before Wales.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.448
Because football is world wide.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.131
Rugby... Approximately twelve
countries take it seriously.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.576
While football, well there
are so many countries.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.241
So obviously we've reached
the round in rugby

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.604
But this... the country has never
been involved in something like this.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.202
So, well, if we're in the
final it will be incredible.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.604
I know that there is much to be
done in the days before the...

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.607
Final Gém.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.371
Without Aaron Ramsey without Ben Davies

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.687
How many losses are there?

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.246
As we know before that
they are so good players

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.965
But they've been so
great for you so far.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.004
I remember looking at Aaron
Ramsey and Ben Davies

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.441
Immediately on 6th Belgian
Belgian 6th final whistle.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.244
Both laugh and cry.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.044
Surely that was both difficult.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.576
They know they've done
something special

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.728
But also know they'll
lose the next gém.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.001
Two yellow cards in five
dogs are very salty

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.010
To lose a final gém in
a tournament like this

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.249
But for me and Aaron it
was so disappointing

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.056
But I remember to
say during Belgium.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.163
"This must be done to the boys and
got them in the semi-finals."

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.016
Our hearts bleed over them

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.407
After they performed
just like everyone else

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.010
I arrived so far.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.536
But again this is a
football tournament.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.483
You nurture the
mindset with Chris

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.285
<i>0 a gém on and over,
an opponent at a time</i>

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.291
But how hard it is now I'm not
thinking about the semi-finals

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.325
90 minutes from the Fifth

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.570
You're 180 minutes of winning
the European Championship.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.649
It must be very difficult not
to let Go your mind roam.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.936
It was very similar
to Northern Ireland

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.088
Play against such
a declining team

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.485
But they were no more skilled.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.000
People did not have a lot more
about them in the championship

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.327
Because they were not
very obvious in assault

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.771
And they were not Ilifo

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.121
Unlike Portugal

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.766
On the day I think
I'm more nervous

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.326
It's not part of the
gém or being playing.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.170
She was like knowing that you did
not have control over anything.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.929
You rely on other people

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.803
And you can not influence the gém.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.764
Fair play For the boys came in.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.723
My sports are good, and
they're not blameless

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.809
But I felt they worked
so hard to be there

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.888
It was rather unfair that
they wanted to miss out.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.602
It was a strange but
exciting feeling

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.085
And look forward to the challenge.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.656
It was clear that they
had done their homework

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.656
And with the big teams that
does not always happen.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.365
We had scored ten, I'm siv "vr.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.416
We were not the top scorers I'm siv '\ / r.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.842
And Portugal had to reach the
semi-finals in a different way

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.882
But nevertheless, I wished them.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.764
In the ten, fifteen, twenty first minutes

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.531
Tactically it was clear that
they were well organized.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.210
Protective, we were exacerbated.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.656
That was a sign of their respect for us.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.800
They were blocking low
for most of the gém.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.327
Two like.

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:21.600
We're fairly sharp when
cutting, like them

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.846
And they protected
well, like us.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.004
The gém, how she was and the
way Portugal played against us

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.087
How they went to
close every door...

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.531
Protect deeply.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.325
And then Aaron Ramsey
he can open the door.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:38.082
It was so frustrating for me To
watch the gém from the side.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.246
Oh, I feel we could have
had an impact on the gém.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.881
He plays so well with Ballet.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.884
Because they are worried not only
about Balo, but also for Ramsey.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.816
Apparently we were the
best in the first half.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.161
Unhappy at half I was
not comfortable...

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.479
We said that at half
time to go about them.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.368
At half time, there was
not between the two

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.370
So when coming out
for the second half

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:11.926
It was all so positive and we continued
to be able to create an opportunity

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.201
And enough to win.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.283
We were four minutes
to reach the FIF.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.288
I never saw John Charles playing

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:39.448
But my dad mentioned
it was like that.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.211
Jumping over all strong
shoulders, pv'ver...

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.685
When you see Ronaldo does that

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.600
There was nothing you
could do to stop that.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.043
I've never seen anyone being
able to stop the bolt then.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.331
You look around and
hang it there.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.604
That's us, that's Cristiano Ronaldo.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.563
He knows where the gel is.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.646
That's why they feed it into it.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.206
You can not jump as loud as it.
Neb.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.925
The bottom of his legs is at
the top of James Chester.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.848
From that moment, I
lost some energy

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.281
And Portugal is ahead

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.085
It's an ideal situation for
them to be able to defend

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.202
<i>Keep track and hit
through wifi-attack.</i>

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.571
It was perfect for them.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.410
The gif changed to the Universe.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.256
That's the first time
we got five fun minutes

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.770
<i>And then they screwed them etc</i>

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.807
They'll score again straight
away, somehow they did...

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.969
I killed the boy for us,
probably at our heads.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.208
The tiredness was
obvious among all.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.642
Loses 2-O in Final Finals.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.486
People do not realize
how much energy is used

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.170
And the emotion in success to date

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.931
And it was all the same one
that was over too much.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.404
It's hard on the top stage
against world famous players

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.284
And that's what's happening.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.722
In the back of
your mind you hope

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.976
If Iwc had been on
our side that day

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.002
That we could have reached the final.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.329
We would go through the whole
again if there was an opportunity

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.720
And I do not think we would
have done a lot differently.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.603
On the final whistle and
out of the competition

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.891
It was upsetting to be honest.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.046
I think...

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.084
I had to leave the field.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.646
Leave the field and sit alone.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.169
I knew that was the end.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.490
No Fifth For me to play.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.362
That was the dream

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.563
And think how feeling
it would be.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.443
And then finally fortunate
enough to be there

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.848
And is 100 times
better than expected.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.165
And then it's all over.
That's us Finished

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.166
He turned the stomach.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.291
It was really hard.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.483
I remember being in the changing room
and everyone else on the field still.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.936
I did not want to go out.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.122
Oh I know I have
to thank Everyone

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.481
All the emigrants who
came out Follow us

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.763
And I had to talk to the media,
and I did not want to do that.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.401
Everyone went through this difficult time

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.650
And To put ourselves on the world
map, in a European tournament

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.603
It was an incredible success for us

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.282
And to go as far as a tournament
contrary to the expectation.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.609
We were the third best team in Europe
We are not the third best in Europe.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.330
Not only does it change football,
it changes a country in my opinion

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.647
Because events like this
do not happen frequently.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.087
The Ewros will affect
Welsh football for years.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.522
That's the end of the tournament for
us but not the end of the team.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.809
It was a perfect example
for any country

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.888
How to prepare for a big tournament

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.122
If we wanted to lose
losing well together.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.527
And succeed in success
with each other

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.360
<i>And the headphones were just about that.</i>

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.722
We did something nobody
expected us to do it

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.762
And succeed much more than
people's expectations

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.202
And as a country we were immensely
respected by the tournament.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.083
The only thing missing
was the trophy.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.568
It was not just the experiences on
the field that were important to me

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.082
<i>Even the hotel was in Dmard and
everyone went to the bus ..</i>

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.922
The atmosphere was incredible.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.360
Chris Gunter plays his music
the same three times.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.641
Every time on the way to the
airport the same old songs.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.491
That's how she was.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.761
Our history was losing but
I'm going to go so far

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.967
It did not make it a little
easier when we lost the gem.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.767
He won France against
Germany to reach the Fifth.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.121
We watched the gém last night

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.445
And feeling somewhat jealous

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.767
Since both of them
then continue.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.566
See France celebrates at the end.
That's where we wanted to be.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.002
That's a praise We were boys because
they did not want to settle

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.441
And think "yes, we
arrived in the Final"

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.164
You could still feel that there
is so much disappointment

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.531
And I'm proud of that.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.848
Portugal 1-0 beat France in an
extra time to win the tournament.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.770
The first in their history.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.843
We came back to Dinard and
got a day as a cohort

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.850
Reflecting on things, so the flight of
the airplane at home was rather quiet.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.087
I had some very tired boy.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.164
You try to understand the truth

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.567
These were not just a few
football matches for Wales

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.896
<i>And enjoy them and do well.
It was worse than that to the puddle.</i>

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.481
It was clear that we had
raised the whole nation.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.248
People know us now.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.487
Sometimes, like Cymro, go
somewhere in the world

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.682
And people do not
know where Wales is

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.883
From now on, the boys of
Wales put on the map.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.723
I realized how much this
meant for everyone.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.216
We thought that it would
be quite ordinary cleaning

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.765
Few people are clapping, etc.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.282
And as we were out of the Euro now would
not be a lot of people's worries.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.456
People have to go back to
work to find another job

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.084
Since they have stopped the Ilall.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.609
In years it was - there were
probably three or four people there

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.529
Welcomes us out of the airport

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.964
This time, we came off the
plane, the streets were there

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.324
Fully crowded, cars were
pulling in, hand waving.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.566
I thought, god,
this is fantastic.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.046
There was no idea of what
was ahead of us in Cardiff.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.249
I've never seen anything
like a player before.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.096
It was almost as if we had won the
competition, and being honest.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.488
It was an incredible
feeling, hoHolanhygoeL.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.528
We are a small country

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.727
And I think if you are not from
Wales you will not understand it

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.286
And people said "Was
it OK to do this?"

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.369
But this is a country that
has never done this before.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.404
That's the first time we've been able
to prove how things were at home.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.776
I do not know anyone knew
how many people were there

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.325
But it was incredible.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.200
And here I am with
Balo and Rambo.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.576
I think Ashley is on one
side and I see Gunter there.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.409
And here I'm telling Balo...

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.856
"God, venture I have not seen
anything like this, are you a dog?"

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.486
And he said "Well, of course,
I've just seen this in Madrid."

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.320
We've won the Champions League. "

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.362
So that's a little
bit of my breath.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.041
Getting this experience with
Wales was something incredible

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.051
And I'm sure \ 7'vr everyone will
remember it for the rest of their lives.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.131
Everyone said thank you and I think
"Well, thank you for anything?"

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.970
I do not understand
what we have done. "

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.291
The welcome at home was something...
He was not a surprise

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.244
But it was an incredible event,
seeing so many people out

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.080
And hear all the stories about everyone,
and to go back to the fans again,

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.771
The supporters went out for a couple
and did not come for five weeks.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.120
I know I'll remember
forever to be part of that

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.163
And it's nice to hear
people's stories

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.416
When they tell you
what it meant to them

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.489
And how their family was inspired
or whatever the story was.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.616
It's something I do not
think it would ever happen,

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.051
Especially for Welsh football

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.402
Has come from 3,000 fans at the
Cardiff City Stadium to watch games

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.681
And in a couple of
years, in no time,

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.681
I saw that response especially
if I will never forget that.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.848
By the summer of 2016

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.566
Wales was eighth in the
world's best team list.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.496
The biggest to climb anything
in the history of football.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.684
A quarter of a million people came out
to the streets I congratulate us.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.005
That was just a bit.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.696
We went further than anyone
had expected, for me,

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.200
So it was very nice for
us to be in Cardiff

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.527
<i>3</i> Qweld all the supporters
Wearing their shirts

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.767
And the children and everyone so happy with us.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.963
People who had failed to get
the chance to say thank you

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.561
And more importantly, I think, there
was an opportunity to thank them.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.961
Welsh fans received an UEFA
"Outstanding Contribution" award

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.923
<i>Out of time in Euro 2016.</i>

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.009
I never did, never think
we would be in a position

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.886
Where the whole nation
was proud of us.
