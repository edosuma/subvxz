10:29.503 --> 10:30.963
There's a reason
why PKZ and KEK

10:31.005 --> 10:32.923
hired you
for this dance.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.592
It's just my first paid gig.
I just really
want it to be good.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.093
Let's try it one more time.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.762
OK.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.388
[Cell phone chimes]
Oh, hold up.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.975
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
I gotta go.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.393
More KEK deliveries.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.103
I thought you
were done with that.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.605
I guess there's
a few more. I'm sorry.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.482
I'll catch you later
at dance rehearsal.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.858
-Yeah.
-OK.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.157
Good. You got my text,
and you're on time.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.784
Yeah, um,
you call it a text,

10:59.825 --> 11:01.202
I call it
emotional blackmail.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.620
All I said was
that it would mean

11:02.662 --> 11:04.163
a lot to
your big brother J.R.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.748
to have you
at the ball,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.459
and how he hasn't
asked anything of you

11:08.501 --> 11:10.544
since finding you again
after all these years.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.339
Yup, that's--that's
the emotional blackmail part.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.424
Whatever you
want to call it.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.926
You're here and
all you have to lose
is a fun night out.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.386
So, here's how
it's going down.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.012
You have 3 dates,

11:20.054 --> 11:21.806
3 locations,
30 minutes apiece.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.183
Wait. So, I only have
30 minutes to decide?

11:24.225 --> 11:25.893
Damon, the event
is tomorrow.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.728
You don't have time
to make a love connection.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.147
Date details are
now in your texts...
[Cell phone chimes]

11:30.189 --> 11:32.108
and you can
thank me later.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.945
Yeah. OK.

11:35.986 --> 11:40.116
Also, fix your face.
Vamonos.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.119
Woman: You're a Pisces?
Damon: Yeah.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.620
That's gonna be
a problem.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
I usually don't
vibe with Pisces.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.665
Sorry.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.291
Woman 2: My followers
don't play,

11:49.333 --> 11:51.293
so you're gonna have
to win them over, too.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.212
What do you like
most about me?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.549
I mean,
I just met you, so...

11:56.590 --> 11:58.759
So, who's your favorite
player of all time?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.511
The Griffeys,
of course.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.138
I mean, what other
father/son duo

12:02.179 --> 12:04.849
played together
in pro sports history?

12:04.890 --> 12:07.017
OK. I see you.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.769
All right.
Tell me your exact
time of birth,

12:08.811 --> 12:10.396
and I may be able
to salvage this

12:10.438 --> 12:11.981
if I know your moon
and rising.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.817
Uh, I don't know what time
I was born. Sorry.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.777
Well, can't you,
like, text your mom
or something?

12:16.819 --> 12:19.113
This is important.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.531
And...?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.450
You're confident.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.578
Wow! You already see
the real me.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.912
Y'all, drop a comment

12:26.954 --> 12:28.539
if you think we make
a cute couple.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.874
[Chuckles]

12:29.915 --> 12:30.916
Woman 3: I see you, too.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
Sub 2.00 ERA,

12:32.585 --> 12:34.670
leading the conference
in strikeouts,

12:34.712 --> 12:37.173
a WHIP of 0.89.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.883
So, you did
your research. Heh.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.844
Oh, yeah. And I can
upgrade you like Beyonce.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.221
But first we gotta
work on that curveball.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.183
Excuse me
for a second.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.225
Oh, yeah.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.352
Just--I got a text.

What's up with Damon
and discount Rihanna?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.387
I don't know.
I hadn't noticed.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.223
Mm-hmm. Then what
you're looking at

13:27.264 --> 13:29.433
must be real important.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.976
Well, I'm just wondering
how someone

13:31.018 --> 13:32.812
I used to eat for lunch is

13:32.853 --> 13:35.022
winning millions of dollars
on the pro circuit.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.858
Mm. Compare and despair
is a dangerous game.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.944
You're right
where you need to be,

13:39.985 --> 13:42.196
and when you
don't need to be here
anymore, you'll know.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.242
Yeah. You're a good friend.

13:46.283 --> 13:50.496
I know.
[Laughs]

13:50.538 --> 13:53.582
Nathaniel Hardin,
you have a very
special delivery.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.125
Who is this from?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.211
Mm-mm.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.922
[Sighs]
Ahem.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.632
"Dust off those
glass slippers

14:01.674 --> 14:03.676
"and bring
your best smile

14:03.717 --> 14:05.261
"'cause this
Prince Charming

14:05.302 --> 14:07.847
wants to see his
Cinderella's smile."

14:07.888 --> 14:09.849
He says
he'll be wearing
a rose in his lapel.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.809
Oh, that is so romantic,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.811
if you're into
that kind of thing.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.437
I really, really am.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.607
What would make it better

14:18.649 --> 14:20.901
is if you would come
to the ball with me.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.364
You know what? Whatever.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.866
I'm in. Let's do it.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.159
We're gonna eat
them girls up.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.786
-Yes!
-They not ready.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.288
Charlotte:
What about this one?

14:32.329 --> 14:34.456
You'd learn
sports marketing

14:34.498 --> 14:35.958
from agents
and retired
pro athletes.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.544
Uh...
[Exhales]

14:38.586 --> 14:40.462
I don't think marketing's
really my thing.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.299
I've given you 5 options
for summer internships,

14:43.340 --> 14:44.842
and none of them
are right?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.594
Simone, work with me.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.846
I know.
I'm trying, but I'm sorry.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.056
None of these
are speaking to me.

14:51.098 --> 14:55.102
Simone,
I'm a senior manager at
a Fortune 500 company.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.771
All I need to do is make
one call and you're in.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.523
Just pick something.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.234
Uh...

15:04.904 --> 15:06.614
At least tell me
which one of
Lando's photos

15:06.655 --> 15:09.408
you like best.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.119
Charlotte, I told you
he still said no.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.413
My brother
doesn't always know
what's best for him.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.248
He seemed
pretty clear to me.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.003
You know what?
I'm pulling rank.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.671
As your potential
big sister,

15:22.713 --> 15:24.924
help me pick out
photos to submit.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.514
Bro, so, you didn't like
any of the women

15:32.556 --> 15:34.016
Gabby sent your way?

15:34.058 --> 15:36.393
[Door closes]
No. I didn't.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.395
All you did was
waste Gabby's time.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.773
I told you that
I wasn't feeling
the masquerade ball.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.567
You want to tell me why?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.986
Hmm. Simone. You know
she's gonna be there,

15:46.028 --> 15:47.571
and you'd rather
sit around here

15:47.613 --> 15:49.323
and drown in
your feelings for her?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.450
Yeah, well, I'm drowning
because of you.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.077
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.704
Your advice not to
tell Simone how I felt,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.206
that was trash, bro.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.667
Then why'd you listen?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.461
Exactly. 'Cause you know my
trash advice was the move.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.047
And getting out of this
funk and going to a dope
event is the move, too.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.299
You keep thinking that you
know what's best for me,

16:07.341 --> 16:09.885
and you just don't, J.,
all right?

16:09.927 --> 16:13.639
So, I'm gonna need
you just to stay out
of my business, bro.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.474
All right, bro.
You got it.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.686
[Door opens and closes]

16:25.567 --> 16:28.195
Oh, Ms. McCalla.
A moment?

16:28.237 --> 16:30.155
Keisha: Hi, Dr. Pace.
Dr. Pace: Is it true that

16:30.197 --> 16:31.699
you're choreographing
the dance for
the masquerade ball?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.701
Yeah, the planning
committee saw

16:33.742 --> 16:35.327
my Black Joy Day dance,

16:35.369 --> 16:36.870
and they thought
that I could bring

16:36.912 --> 16:38.580
a unique
perspective, so...

16:38.622 --> 16:40.749
As I'm sure you're aware,
professional choreographing

16:40.791 --> 16:42.710
outside of class
is against the rules.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.336
No, I know.
I just thought that

16:44.378 --> 16:45.838
since this was
a Bringston thing...

16:45.879 --> 16:49.008
Rules are rules,
no matter who it's for.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.844
Dr. Pace, I promise
nothing like this
will ever happen again.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.722
I know it won't,
because this is
the final straw.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.474
You've officially
failed my class.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.977
I hope this opportunity
is worth it.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.199
[Line ringing]

17:25.919 --> 17:27.463
[Knock on door,
door opens]

17:35.888 --> 17:38.348
PKZ offered me
the photographer job.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.060
Oh. Congrats.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.895
My guess,
Charlotte submitted

17:42.936 --> 17:45.147
my photos
behind my back.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.815
And please tell me
that you didn't have
anything to do with this.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.401
I maybe helped her
pick out some photos.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.903
After I specifically
said I wasn't interested.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.571
Lando, what was I
supposed to do?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.782
I need to make a good
impression with her.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.784
PKZ means a lot to me.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.536
So, if you get into PKZ,
is this how it's gonna be?

17:59.578 --> 18:01.580
You choosing what
Charlotte wants
over how I feel?

18:01.622 --> 18:04.083
Ain't nobody gonna
focus on you.
I'm gonna focus on me.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.834
Is this really
that deep to you?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.795
No one is forcing you
to take this job, Lando.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.546
Except they are.
Charlotte told
the whole family.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.090
Now everybody
pressuring me.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.050
Because they know you
love photography, Lando.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.968
Why won't you just
take a chance?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.678
Because sometimes
when your passion
becomes your profession,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.931
it changes it for you,
and I don't want that.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.641
You struggle with being
in the spotlight.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.726
Maybe your resistance
with sharing your work

18:22.768 --> 18:26.146
is because you're afraid
it'll bring attention
that you don't want.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.314
Wow.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.070
So, you go behind my back
and conspire with my sister

18:33.112 --> 18:34.738
to get me a job
I don't even want,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.573
and now you
psychoanalyzing me.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.450
Maybe you and Charlotte
really are sisters.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.619
[Scoffs]

18:40.661 --> 18:42.287
You know what?
I think I had enough

18:42.329 --> 18:45.040
of the Johnson
siblings today, so,

18:45.082 --> 18:48.168
if you don't mind,
I gotta go to
dance rehearsal.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.558
Cam: Hey, Lou, my guy,
your two left feet

19:02.599 --> 19:04.434
got you wobbling
out there.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.271
Wobble! That should be
your line name.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.190
OK, Milli Vanilli.
Get it?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.525
'Cause you can sing.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.027
Right. I can.
They couldn't.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.863
Perry: Bro, you dug deep
for that reference.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.282
How old are you really?
Cam: Right!

19:20.033 --> 19:23.370
Uh, Kesh. Hey.
You good?

19:23.412 --> 19:26.874
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's run through it.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.543
5, 6, 7, 8.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.755
Cam, you're on
the wrong side.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.842
Cam: No, I'm not.
Keisha: Just do it again.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.846
5, 6, 7, 8.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.059
OK, you're a half a beat
too slow now.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.479
What the hell are you doing?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.190
Simone: No, it wasn't--
Keisha: Well, Maybe if you

19:51.231 --> 19:53.192
spent more time focusing
on learning the steps

19:53.233 --> 19:54.359
instead of playing around
with your little friends,

19:54.401 --> 19:55.903
it would look better.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.614
Keisha, I was the one
that messed up, not Cam.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.741
It's gonna be dope, OK?

20:03.827 --> 20:05.412
My bad. Y'all are--

20:06.538 --> 20:08.373
y'all are gonna be great.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.667
Simone's right. Um,

20:10.709 --> 20:12.377
I'll see all y'all later.
