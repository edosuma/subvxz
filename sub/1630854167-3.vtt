00:18.342 --> 00:20.344
[wildlife chittering, chirping]

00:26.750 --> 00:29.453
I was fluffing the pillow.

00:29.553 --> 00:30.534
It's fine.
We don't need to talk--

00:30.634 --> 00:32.636
I was fluffing.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.118
I was not humping.

00:35.559 --> 00:37.781
That pillow
did not represent Vida.

00:37.881 --> 00:41.024
I was not simulating
intercourse with a pillow,

00:41.124 --> 00:43.787
despite the plausibility issues
of my alternate explanation--

00:43.887 --> 00:45.789
Please stop.

00:45.889 --> 00:48.171
If not for me,
then for your own self-respect.

00:50.533 --> 00:53.076
I was surprised to learn
that you were looking
into Vida's murder.

00:53.176 --> 00:54.797
I heard you moved on.

00:54.897 --> 00:57.860
That certainly would have
been the healthy choice.

01:00.223 --> 01:04.527
I think you'd agree
it's a question that can't
be left unanswered.

01:04.627 --> 01:06.489
It's already been answered.

01:06.589 --> 01:08.130
The official police account
is true.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.732
The two of you fought.

01:09.832 --> 01:11.413
Vida ran to the swamp
to buy drugs

01:11.513 --> 01:13.015
and was killed by a junkie

01:13.115 --> 01:15.497
who valued her diamonds
more than her life.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.339
Well, that is just
the simple answer,
and you know it.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.261
Mira, pendejo,
I know my daughter

01:19.361 --> 01:20.282
certainly better
than you ever did.

01:20.362 --> 01:22.364
No, you do not.

01:23.845 --> 01:25.267
And I resent that.

01:25.367 --> 01:28.270
When she was in pain,
she did drugs,

01:28.370 --> 01:30.372
and she was in pain.

01:31.373 --> 01:33.755
Whatever lies Vida told you,

01:33.855 --> 01:36.077
she spent most of her time
in our Rosemary Beach house
before she died

01:36.177 --> 01:38.880
because she needed
to get away from you.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.642
I don't believe that.

01:40.742 --> 01:44.225
Nobody wishes for their
child's marriage to fall apart,
but I prayed for it...

01:45.987 --> 01:47.528
and was grateful
there was another man

01:47.628 --> 01:49.951
who brought something
other than misery
into her life.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.295
Stop this ridiculous
investigation

01:54.395 --> 01:56.437
and go back
to whatever it is you do.

02:00.040 --> 02:00.941
Get out of my house.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.744
-Her drug use, her death.
-Get out.

02:03.844 --> 02:05.666
The perpetrator
you're hunting is yourself.

02:05.766 --> 02:07.748
You're a child, Bell.

02:07.848 --> 02:09.850
A spoiled, drunk child.

02:14.214 --> 02:16.216
[wistful music playing]

02:25.866 --> 02:27.867
I should've done this
a long time ago.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.890
It would have saved you.

02:30.990 --> 02:33.933
Well, if you're gonna do it,
do it already.

02:34.033 --> 02:36.396

03:04.863 --> 03:06.565
Bellwether, not again!

03:06.665 --> 03:09.168
I tried to shed my mortal coil.

03:09.268 --> 03:12.611
You and I both know
that the roof is plagued
with wood rot.

03:12.711 --> 03:14.973
That would definitely not work.

03:15.073 --> 03:17.215
But why did you even try?

03:17.315 --> 03:19.578
Alejandro stopped by.

03:19.678 --> 03:21.720
-[sighs]
-He called me a spoiled child.

03:23.121 --> 03:26.464
Oh, baby, don't listen to him.

03:26.564 --> 03:29.427
How about
I run you a bath, huh?

03:29.527 --> 03:31.749
I'll make some hot cocoa.
You love hot cocoa.

03:31.849 --> 03:33.851
I'll be right back.

03:36.094 --> 03:37.075

03:45.943 --> 03:47.945
Bill Mason of "The Cockpits"?

03:49.747 --> 03:51.689
Yeah, that's me.

03:51.789 --> 03:53.871
You're under arrest
for the murder of Mel Doppler.

04:00.397 --> 04:02.579
Not cool, bro.

04:02.679 --> 04:05.062
Guess you were in such a hurry,
you couldn't even let me
get dressed first, huh?

04:05.162 --> 04:07.164
[laughs]

04:07.564 --> 04:09.566
Enough, The Rock but dumber.

04:10.367 --> 04:11.508
I'm innocent, all right?

04:11.608 --> 04:14.591
Okay, John Cena but dumber.

04:14.691 --> 04:16.233
I have an alibi.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.674
Based on a bogus phone call

04:17.774 --> 04:20.377
that establishes
the wrong time of death.

04:21.337 --> 04:23.400
And I have proof,

04:23.500 --> 04:25.501
Dave Bautista but dumber.

[clears throat]

[cell phone ringing]

04:44.240 --> 04:45.741
Hello.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.843
[softly]
Mel Doppler's murder...

04:48.924 --> 04:52.067
what was that thing
about the pair of futons?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.709
No, periphytons.

04:53.809 --> 04:55.190
Fuck is that?

04:55.290 --> 04:57.633
Uh, freshwater organisms.

04:57.733 --> 05:00.355
They establish
the time of death.

05:00.455 --> 05:02.557
You sound like crap,
by the way.

05:02.657 --> 05:03.719
Hmm.

05:03.819 --> 05:05.480
[phone beeps]

05:05.580 --> 05:06.842
[exhales sharply]

05:06.942 --> 05:08.483
Periphytons, Bill.

05:08.583 --> 05:09.444
Fuck is that?

05:09.544 --> 05:10.645
They establish a time frame

05:10.745 --> 05:12.747
that you don't have
an alibi for.

05:13.268 --> 05:14.769
So we have motive,

05:14.869 --> 05:17.432
we have means, and...

05:19.153 --> 05:20.575
we have that third thing.

05:20.675 --> 05:22.257
Oh, please.

05:22.357 --> 05:24.459
I'll do, like, half the max.
That's five years.

05:24.559 --> 05:26.741
I can do that
standing on my head.

05:26.841 --> 05:28.843
Don't you have
a two-year-old son?

05:30.444 --> 05:32.446
I'll make it up
on the other side.

05:33.487 --> 05:35.489
Oh, right. [scoffs]

05:36.370 --> 05:38.512
So you're just gonna lie around

05:38.612 --> 05:41.535
while some woman
raises your child alone?

05:43.017 --> 05:47.401
Then you'll waltz back in

Oh, man, you're a mess.

-[normal voice] I'm a mess?
-Yeah.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.991
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.733
Have you heard yourself?

05:59.833 --> 06:01.615
What's really bugging you,

06:01.715 --> 06:03.577
murder or the fact
that I'm a piece-of-shit dad?

06:03.677 --> 06:05.499
'Cause only one of those
is illegal.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.500
Murder.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.142
Murder bugs me.

06:09.242 --> 06:11.244
[quirky music playing]

06:14.727 --> 06:16.849
-Well, hello.
-Hey.

06:18.251 --> 06:19.912
Really, Urleen? You like this?

06:20.012 --> 06:22.575
-I like a big man.
-I'm big everywhere.

06:23.856 --> 06:25.958
Yeah, I doubt that,
given the steroids.

06:26.058 --> 06:28.060
Oh, that just affects
the testes.

06:29.101 --> 06:30.643
-Good to know.
-[hissing]

06:30.743 --> 06:32.845
-Whoa, good catch.
-Yeah.

06:32.945 --> 06:35.327
I found it
under the mayor's couch.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.009
If you're wondering
where the office cat is,

06:37.109 --> 06:38.370
I got your answer right here.

06:38.470 --> 06:40.132
Oh, shit. Is the mayor okay?

06:40.232 --> 06:43.335
Physically. He did cry
like a little man-bitch.

06:43.435 --> 06:44.656
[both chuckle]

06:44.756 --> 06:46.758
But I couldn't really
enjoy it today.

06:47.719 --> 06:49.721
Mm?

06:50.322 --> 06:52.324
'Cause of what happened
with Bell last night?

07:00.532 --> 07:03.635
Maybe a little something
in your stomach will help.

07:03.735 --> 07:05.817
Mm, that's a fine idea, Mother.

07:07.699 --> 07:10.281
Welcome to the manic part
of manic depression.

07:11.743 --> 07:12.884
I am fine.

07:12.984 --> 07:15.406
Do you hear me?
I am totally fine!

07:15.506 --> 07:17.408
I am A-okay!

07:17.508 --> 07:18.970
You seem fine.

07:19.070 --> 07:21.072
Yeah, he seems real healthy.

07:21.912 --> 07:24.455
[doorbell buzzing]

07:24.555 --> 07:27.178
I brought him some books on
how to recover from infidelity.

07:27.278 --> 07:29.280
Bell is stapling.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.423
-That's not good.
-Alejandro paid him a visit.

07:32.523 --> 07:34.064
-Oh.
-I was sleeping.

07:34.164 --> 07:36.647
Otherwise I would have...
[sighs] shot him?

07:41.612 --> 07:43.614
What the hell happened?

07:45.135 --> 07:48.238
Attempted hanging
and some staples.

07:48.338 --> 07:50.000
-Staples?
-Yeah.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.102
Where is he?

07:53.023 --> 07:54.804
Let's get up, buddy. [sighs]

07:54.904 --> 07:56.086
[Bell] I can't move.

I'm a paralytic zounderkite.

07:59.349 --> 08:01.351
[quirky somber music playing]

08:19.729 --> 08:21.730
I think you're depressed.

08:23.772 --> 08:25.474
Though to be honest,

08:25.574 --> 08:28.677
I didn't think depression
was stackable with agoraphobia.

08:28.777 --> 08:30.839
I thought it was like
psoriasis and eczema--

08:30.939 --> 08:32.941
your body just
sort of picks one.

08:35.063 --> 08:37.065
That didn't work.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.828
Oh, maybe I could read to you.

08:41.990 --> 08:43.992
It always works with Tyler.

I smoke too much weed

are shot.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.522
Beach house?
You never mentioned that.

12:41.622 --> 12:45.126
I didn't know she was there
until last night.

12:45.226 --> 12:47.228
Well, Bell,
there could be clues there.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.871
I don't want clues.

12:51.472 --> 12:55.216
This is my life,
and I want to be done with it!

12:55.316 --> 12:56.817
[grunts in frustration]

12:56.917 --> 12:59.780
You know, killing yourself
isn't the only way
to end suffering.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.623
You ever think
of taking responsibility
for what happened?

13:02.723 --> 13:03.584
[scoffs]

13:03.684 --> 13:04.825
Guilt ends suffering?

13:04.925 --> 13:06.787
What kind of perverted Buddhism
is that?

13:06.887 --> 13:09.429
[sighs] No, no, not guilt.
Truth.

13:09.529 --> 13:11.311
Look, there's a saying:
"The truth will heal"--

13:11.411 --> 13:12.713
No, thanks!

13:12.813 --> 13:14.314
That's almost
the exact same thing

13:14.414 --> 13:16.036
my bastard father-in-law
told me last night.

13:16.136 --> 13:17.958
You didn't let me finish.

13:18.058 --> 13:21.441
"The truth will heal you,
but first, it'll fuck you,"

13:21.541 --> 13:23.543
and not in a loving,
consensual way.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.106
I am taking to my bed.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.812
[sighs]

13:32.912 --> 13:34.914
I got a list
of Dr. Alvarez's recent orders.

13:37.236 --> 13:39.238
Digital soil thermometer,

13:39.839 --> 13:41.220
John Coltrane CDs...

13:41.320 --> 13:43.322
-Who still buys CDs?
-Mm.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.625
Florida.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.726
Analog soil thermometer,

13:48.367 --> 13:49.949
sulfuric acidifier,

13:50.049 --> 13:52.051
Coco One-Steps.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.673
-That's a tomato thing.
-Oh.

13:54.773 --> 13:56.035
[gasps happily]

13:56.135 --> 13:57.996
He's a bluehead.

13:58.096 --> 14:00.098
Ah, I got this.

14:01.260 --> 14:02.281
[Alvarez] That color.

14:02.381 --> 14:04.443
-My God, you're an artist.
-[chuckles]

14:04.543 --> 14:06.365
What's the secret?

14:06.465 --> 14:08.467
Eggshells and alligator scat.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.009
I'll text you the proportions.

14:11.109 --> 14:13.371
You'd seriously share that?

14:13.471 --> 14:16.174
To help spread nature's beauty?

14:16.274 --> 14:18.276
Why on Earth not?

14:19.477 --> 14:21.479
I may even consider
sharing a cutting.

14:22.921 --> 14:27.065
Well, if there's ever
anything I can do
to repay you, I--

14:27.165 --> 14:29.187
If we're being honest...

14:29.287 --> 14:31.289
[sighs]

14:32.330 --> 14:35.193
My son
is struggling emotionally,

14:35.293 --> 14:38.836
and there just aren't
many good therapists out here,

14:38.936 --> 14:41.298
certainly not like you,
Dr. Alvarez.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.302
What did you say his name was?

14:46.023 --> 14:48.525
I don't care
if he was on Oprah.

14:48.625 --> 14:49.807
And it was '88.

14:49.907 --> 14:52.049
That was trashy Oprah,
not good Oprah!

14:52.149 --> 14:55.132
And why didn't anyone ask me
if I wanted this?

14:55.232 --> 14:56.894
Because you would've said no.

14:56.994 --> 14:58.815
You have your own
unresolved issues

14:58.915 --> 15:00.457
and compulsive behaviors,

15:00.557 --> 15:03.100
but there's no magical shrink
landing on your roof,

15:03.200 --> 15:04.301
presuming you have one.

15:04.401 --> 15:06.923
What do you mean
by "compulsive behavior"?

15:07.764 --> 15:09.826
Nothing.

15:09.926 --> 15:12.068
-Say it.
-No.

15:12.168 --> 15:14.351
Come on. Come on, say it.

15:14.451 --> 15:16.633
Your appetite for, uh,

15:16.733 --> 15:19.315
casual, meaningless--

15:19.415 --> 15:21.557
Ah, see, if I were a man,

15:21.657 --> 15:23.659
all that'd get me is
an "attaboy," and you know it.

15:26.422 --> 15:27.884
Also, why are you
wearing a tux?

15:27.984 --> 15:29.986
I like this suit,

15:30.626 --> 15:32.288
and I'd only worn it twice.

15:32.388 --> 15:34.770
What should I have done,
business casual?

15:34.870 --> 15:39.154
No, you should have worn
real clothes that don't smell.

15:41.236 --> 15:43.238
Now.

15:46.842 --> 15:47.983
[Bell sighs]

15:48.083 --> 15:49.785
Do it for the tomatoes.

15:49.885 --> 15:51.667
I will.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.769
She's working him.

15:54.489 --> 15:56.992
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:57.092 --> 15:58.794
Definitely bring that up
to your therapist.

15:58.894 --> 16:00.896
Yeah.

16:01.896 --> 16:03.318
All right, go.

16:03.418 --> 16:05.420
Do it.
Prince of Tides this shit.

16:09.464 --> 16:11.686
Standard intake sessions
are 90 minutes,

16:11.786 --> 16:14.529
but with my profile,
you'll take half the day.

16:14.629 --> 16:16.691
Your initial questions
will pertain

16:16.791 --> 16:19.774
to possible cerebral trauma
and other somatic factors.

16:19.874 --> 16:22.977
Then you'll cover the bases
on childhood sexual abuse,

16:23.077 --> 16:25.339
chemical dependence, violence,

16:25.439 --> 16:27.441
arrest,
and/or institutionalization.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.724
How was that?
Was that everything
you hoped for?

16:31.886 --> 16:33.307
[sighs]

16:33.407 --> 16:34.228
Good luck.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.330
[whimsical music playing]

16:41.815 --> 16:45.619
You know, it's probably
not the greatest choice
to have guns in the house.

16:46.660 --> 16:49.062
Indigo, Bell's father,
hated guns.

16:50.303 --> 16:52.305
He knew that I loved them.

16:53.867 --> 16:57.110
He knew I needed
that sense of power. [chuckles]

16:58.672 --> 17:02.435
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened to Bell's dad?

17:04.317 --> 17:06.319
Six years ago,

17:07.240 --> 17:09.622
he got rip-roaring drunk

17:09.722 --> 17:11.724
and he fell off the hayloft.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.167
Broke his neck.

17:15.328 --> 17:17.430
Wow.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.532
That...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.033
sucks.

17:21.133 --> 17:23.135
What sucked harder

17:24.697 --> 17:26.699
is that Bell found him.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.704
That-- that does suck harder.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.346
How did he handle it?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.788
He didn't handle it.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.653
He handled me.

17:41.753 --> 17:44.616
My grief, my suffering.

17:44.716 --> 17:46.718
He didn't have any time
for himself...

17:48.800 --> 17:50.802
And no time for Vida.

17:53.204 --> 17:54.706
That wasn't your fault.

17:54.806 --> 17:56.808
Yes, it was.

17:58.970 --> 18:02.493
No kid should have
to fix their parent.

18:07.098 --> 18:09.100
[gasps]

18:09.901 --> 18:11.903
[sniffles] Oh, God.

18:12.783 --> 18:14.785
I'm sorry.

18:15.506 --> 18:17.508
I don't know what's going on.

18:18.629 --> 18:20.631
You're thinking about Tyler.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.756
You'll have him
for your whole life, you know.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.242
My parents, they, um--

18:34.164 --> 18:36.687
[sniffles] They didn't believe
in the whole lifetime thing.

18:39.609 --> 18:42.532
I won't ever
let anything hurt my Ty.

18:45.335 --> 18:47.337
Not his father, not me.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.222
Nobody's gonna hurt my boy.

18:57.066 --> 18:58.087
[Alvarez] You describe
two people

18:58.187 --> 19:00.129
who barely communicated.

19:00.229 --> 19:02.231
What do you believe
caused this failure?

19:02.872 --> 19:05.054
Me.

19:05.154 --> 19:07.256
I did, 100%.
Asked and answered.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.098
-I win.
-No, you don't.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.500
-That was evasion.
-I'm taking responsibility.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.602
-But for what?
-Everything.

19:14.643 --> 19:16.665
It's very courageous.

19:16.765 --> 19:19.348
I feel like
I'm being an awesome patient

19:19.448 --> 19:21.510
and you're not
recognizing me for it.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.612
Bell, you're holding on
to a secret,

19:24.653 --> 19:26.675
and it's poisoning you.

19:26.775 --> 19:28.957
Tell him, Bell.
About your father--

19:29.057 --> 19:31.059
I don't want
to talk about my father!

19:33.301 --> 19:35.303
[clears throat] Or my mother.

19:36.905 --> 19:39.728
A man finds out
his wife cheated.

19:39.828 --> 19:42.010
The affair was his fault,
and it led to her murder.

19:42.110 --> 19:45.093
Man hangs himself,
then tries to feed himself
to an alligator.

19:45.193 --> 19:46.574
It's a tale as old as time.

19:46.674 --> 19:48.176
It's virtually a cliche
at this point.

19:48.276 --> 19:50.278
The end. [chuckles]

19:51.319 --> 19:53.501
You know what? Screw it.
You're just like
all the other shrinks.

19:53.601 --> 19:55.843
Do the hallucinations
soothe you or disturb you?

19:58.286 --> 20:00.288
What hallucinations?

20:01.008 --> 20:03.010
The ones projecting right here.

20:05.332 --> 20:07.615
Are you in control of them,
or are they in control of you?

20:09.096 --> 20:11.519
Bell, you're not up
for a journey

20:11.619 --> 20:13.601
to the core of your soul,

20:13.701 --> 20:17.785
fine, but find a way to live.

20:21.348 --> 20:23.330
Broadly, we're looking
at panic disorder

20:23.430 --> 20:25.572
manifesting in agoraphobia,

20:25.672 --> 20:27.374
narcissistic
personality traits,

20:27.474 --> 20:29.476
and somehow, oddly,

20:30.717 --> 20:33.180
both elements
of bipolar I and bipolar II.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.281
What's the fix?

20:35.922 --> 20:38.044
Well, honestly,
I told him to get a hobby.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.948
Bell mentioned
a project he was doing.

20:42.048 --> 20:43.670
From what I can piece together,
he stopped,

20:43.770 --> 20:45.772
then soon after,
the suicide attempt.

20:46.973 --> 20:49.195
He was trying
to find his wife's killer.

20:49.295 --> 20:51.437
-He should get back to that.
-Hmm.

20:51.537 --> 20:53.759
Because he needs closure.

20:53.859 --> 20:56.342
No, he could knit a sweater,
for all I care.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.585
He just needs to do something.

21:00.386 --> 21:03.048
Well, I was helping him,
but we sort of--

21:03.148 --> 21:05.150
sort of hit a dead end, so...

21:06.111 --> 21:09.455
Well-- Well, what if someone

21:09.555 --> 21:11.637
broke through that dead end?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.700
Oh, you.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.663
You have an exceptional ability

21:17.763 --> 21:19.104
to overcome obstacles.

21:19.204 --> 21:21.206
I've seen it.

21:23.328 --> 21:24.910
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.312
No, no,
I will not be manipulated.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.274
-Oh, no.
-No. Can you hear me?

21:29.374 --> 21:31.376
I'm out. Count me out.

21:33.818 --> 21:35.720
Damn it.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.882
[women giggling]

21:37.982 --> 21:39.724
Oh, hey, Cammie.

21:39.824 --> 21:41.826
Hey, Bitty.
Just here to pick up Ty.

21:42.587 --> 21:43.648
[chuckles]

21:43.748 --> 21:45.650
Hey, bug, what's going on

21:45.750 --> 21:48.212
besides this thing
that you have on your head?

21:48.312 --> 21:49.854
We're talking
about our feelings.

21:49.954 --> 21:51.215
Trish is mad.

21:51.315 --> 21:53.317
Odell didn't even
notice my hair.

21:54.198 --> 21:56.220
Maybe now that
you're all detective and shit,

21:56.320 --> 21:57.621
you can find out
who he's looking at,

21:57.721 --> 21:59.723
'cause it sure as shit
ain't me.

22:00.324 --> 22:02.326
Ty...

22:02.806 --> 22:05.709
did you tell Trish
that Mommy's a detective?

22:05.809 --> 22:06.870
When I was his age,

22:06.970 --> 22:10.073
I told everyone
Mama did Beyonce's hair.

22:10.173 --> 22:11.755
Ooh, that head.

22:11.855 --> 22:14.077
I could've made the queen
an empress.

22:14.177 --> 22:15.279
[chuckles]

22:15.379 --> 22:17.361
Baby, we don't say things
that aren't true.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.242
You caught two bad guys.

22:19.342 --> 22:22.646
Huh, I thought all you did
was annoy the crap

22:22.746 --> 22:24.247
out of everybody
with those dang tickets.

22:24.347 --> 22:26.049
[laughter]

22:26.149 --> 22:27.971
Actually,
I arrested two murderers.

22:28.071 --> 22:29.773
-Wait, you did what?
-What?

22:29.873 --> 22:31.254
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah!

22:31.354 --> 22:32.775
Yeah, I may not be
an official detective,

22:32.875 --> 22:34.857
but in case
y'all were wondering,
I am good at this.

22:34.957 --> 22:37.500
-Oh, okay, queen.
-Okay.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.502
As a matter of fact, Bianca,
can you keep watching Ty?

22:39.602 --> 22:41.184
Gotta go to the beach
and look for some clues.

22:41.284 --> 22:42.705
[Tyler] I wanna go!

22:42.805 --> 22:44.747
Ms. Millicent gave me a book
about the beach.

22:44.847 --> 22:47.270
If I was doing Beyonce's hair,
I'd take Bianca.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.191
She would.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.293
Just saying.

22:53.696 --> 22:56.559
[Cammie] Okay,
so I'm gonna look for clues,
and you're gonna look for...

22:56.659 --> 22:59.161
-Sand dollars?
-Nice!

22:59.261 --> 23:01.563
Oh, bet
there's a bunch over there

23:01.663 --> 23:02.925
at the end of the beach, huh?

23:03.025 --> 23:05.287
-'Cause of the tides.
-What?

23:05.387 --> 23:06.768
How'd you get so smart?

23:06.868 --> 23:08.090
[chuckles]

23:08.190 --> 23:10.272
I'm gonna get some
for Ms. Millicent.

23:11.513 --> 23:13.175
Hey.

23:13.275 --> 23:15.297
Hey.

23:15.397 --> 23:18.019
Gonna tell you something
about your grandparents.

23:18.119 --> 23:20.121
You do have a grandma
and a grandpa.

23:20.722 --> 23:22.804
They're somewhere, but, um...

23:24.445 --> 23:25.747
a long time ago,

23:25.847 --> 23:27.388
when I was your age,

23:27.488 --> 23:29.811
they decided they had to leave.

23:30.732 --> 23:32.353
Why?

23:32.453 --> 23:34.115
It's complicated.

23:34.215 --> 23:35.837
Did they love you?

23:35.937 --> 23:37.939
I don't know.

23:38.859 --> 23:41.462
And I don't know
where they are, so I can't ask.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.432
I didn't tell you,
and that was wrong.

23:52.633 --> 23:53.654
It's not good for families

23:53.754 --> 23:55.756
when people keep secrets
from each other.

23:56.517 --> 23:58.518
So let's promise, you and I,
never to do that, okay?

24:02.642 --> 24:04.344
Hey. Hey, you know what?

24:04.444 --> 24:06.646
Ms. Millicent
loves whale bones.

24:07.727 --> 24:08.949
[both giggle]

24:09.049 --> 24:10.951
She likes to use them
to stir cocktails,

24:11.051 --> 24:12.953
so why don't you go
look for them over there

24:13.053 --> 24:14.434
and I'll look over here, okay?

24:14.534 --> 24:16.536
Okay.

24:22.382 --> 24:24.384

24:57.536 --> 24:59.538
The hell is that?

25:03.582 --> 25:05.804
[Tyler] Mom,
there's no whale bones.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.525
I'm coming to your spot.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.627
No, sweetie.

25:10.829 --> 25:12.831
We need dune grass.
Pick some of that.

if you want.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.673
[grunts]

25:35.773 --> 25:37.775
Oh, shit.

26:00.677 --> 26:02.679
Oye.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.542
How can you two be so stupid?

26:05.642 --> 26:08.785
You have no self-control.
Transporting off-book product
to Tampa?

26:08.885 --> 26:12.308
Oh, relax, we send
a dozen trucks every week.

26:12.408 --> 26:15.992
One little box off one truck
is not a problem, okay?

26:16.092 --> 26:16.913
No one will know.

26:17.013 --> 26:18.995
I know.

26:19.095 --> 26:22.278
And if I do, anyone can.

26:22.378 --> 26:24.780
You both are only part
of El Calvero Spirits
as long as I allow it.

26:25.621 --> 26:26.762
It was all Yasiel.

26:26.862 --> 26:28.484
I had nothing
to do with it, okay?

26:28.584 --> 26:31.527
-[paper rips]
-Ow! What are you doing?

26:31.627 --> 26:33.609
Whatever.

26:33.709 --> 26:35.751
-Read the room!
-Sorry.

26:52.447 --> 26:54.509
Oh, shit.

26:54.609 --> 26:56.771
[dramatic music playing]

27:01.896 --> 27:03.898
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on. Come on.

27:04.819 --> 27:06.361
Okay.

27:06.461 --> 27:07.602
Wait. Mom, look.

27:07.702 --> 27:09.003
Cool. More water.

27:09.103 --> 27:10.765
No, it's a "essotery."

27:10.865 --> 27:12.246
I think
you mean estuary, honey.

27:12.346 --> 27:14.048
Wait, I wanna look!

27:14.148 --> 27:17.031
Maybe some other time, Ty,
but we gotta go home,
all right? Come on.

27:19.713 --> 27:22.416
Please? I love estuaries.

27:22.516 --> 27:25.019
Yeah? What's your favorite
thing about estuaries, huh?

27:25.119 --> 27:26.660
They have two kinds of water.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.583
Whoa, two kinds of water?

27:29.683 --> 27:31.945
That does sound cool.
How does that work?

27:32.045 --> 27:34.668
Sometimes
the swamp water goes down.

27:34.768 --> 27:37.831
Other times,
the ocean water goes up.

27:37.931 --> 27:40.274
Whoa, that is neat. Buckle up.

27:40.374 --> 27:42.415
We'll come back real soon
and take a look, okay?

27:46.379 --> 27:48.702
Wait, did you say
that the water can flow
in either direction?

27:50.663 --> 27:52.665
Huh, okay.

27:54.387 --> 27:56.649
Excuse me, Officer.
Do you have a moment?

27:56.749 --> 27:58.751
My name is Alejandro Perez.

27:59.752 --> 28:02.015
Yes. How can I help you?

28:02.115 --> 28:05.898
For one, can you explain
what a police officer
from Boggsville

28:05.998 --> 28:07.900
is doing here
on Rosemary Beach?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.002
Oh, just taking my boy
to the beach.

28:11.684 --> 28:15.508
I think that's what we Cubans
call "un tremendo paquete,"

28:15.608 --> 28:19.531
which translates
to "big package,"
but means "big lie."

28:22.334 --> 28:23.796
Like I always told my children,

28:23.896 --> 28:25.437
don't wander too far
from your own beach.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.519
It dirties the sand and...

28:27.619 --> 28:29.621
confuses the lifeguards.

28:31.703 --> 28:33.705
And like
I've always told my child,

28:34.146 --> 28:35.727
all Florida shoreline
is public,

28:35.827 --> 28:38.109
so go to whatever beach
you want.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.492
You say that to your child?

28:40.592 --> 28:42.594
Yes, I do.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.477
Early interest
in, um, property rights.

28:46.518 --> 28:47.699
Have a blessed day.

-[gasping]

29:05.616 --> 29:07.618
[grunts]

29:09.740 --> 29:10.961
You Tasered me!

29:11.061 --> 29:13.484
I can name six worse things
you've done to your body today.

29:13.584 --> 29:15.045
[screams]

29:15.145 --> 29:16.687
I might have a lead.

29:16.787 --> 29:18.789
I went to Rosemary Beach.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.592
-The Perez house?
-Mm-hmm.

29:22.232 --> 29:23.454
What did you observe?

29:23.554 --> 29:26.456
Well, for starters,
I saw a man get his anus waxed

29:26.556 --> 29:29.940
by what I suspect to be
adult film entertainers.

29:30.040 --> 29:34.104
Mm, that'd be
Vida's brother Yasiel.

29:34.204 --> 29:35.785
And I met the dad.

29:35.885 --> 29:38.588
He threatened me.
Those people have
some serious shit to hide.

29:38.688 --> 29:41.551
All families
have things to hide,
but how does that help us?

29:41.651 --> 29:43.653
I need specifics.

29:43.973 --> 29:45.275
I don't have specifics.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.377
-Well, what do you have?
-Doubt.

29:48.378 --> 29:51.961
I now doubt
the official police accounts,

29:52.061 --> 29:54.884
so you can either
get your ass off the couch,
help me figure this out,

29:54.984 --> 29:56.606
or I can get back
to my fucking life.

29:56.706 --> 29:58.708
Which one is it?

30:00.790 --> 30:02.091
I am humoring you,

30:02.191 --> 30:04.193
reluctantly.

30:06.035 --> 30:08.037
The Perez house would be there.

30:09.638 --> 30:12.301
Yeah, yeah,
that's the estuary I saw.

30:12.401 --> 30:13.782
Can you bring up
the weather system

30:13.882 --> 30:15.304
for the day Vida was killed?

30:15.404 --> 30:18.507
Yes, although
to what end escapes me.

30:18.607 --> 30:20.609
I need to look at water levels.

30:22.290 --> 30:24.393
What? It's a thing.
I looked it up, okay?

30:24.493 --> 30:26.495
[typing]

30:27.455 --> 30:29.958
Okay, now, can you shift
through the time

30:30.058 --> 30:32.620
between when you last saw Vida
and when her body was found?

30:36.464 --> 30:38.246
[chimes]

30:38.346 --> 30:40.768
Yeah. Yes, a storm surge.

30:40.868 --> 30:42.870
See, that's the thing
that I looked up.

30:43.671 --> 30:45.453
See that? So usually,

30:45.553 --> 30:48.056
water from the estuary
flows from the swamp,

30:48.156 --> 30:51.459
but tidal surges cause the
estuaries to flow backwards.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.860
So that night,

30:52.960 --> 30:56.784
water flowed
from the gulf to the swamp.

30:56.884 --> 30:59.146
The cops assumed that Vida
was killed at the swamp,

30:59.246 --> 31:01.188
but really, she could have
been killed at the beach

31:01.288 --> 31:03.290
and then washed into the swamp.

31:03.851 --> 31:05.192
[sighs]

31:05.292 --> 31:06.994
The investigation
was predicated

31:07.094 --> 31:09.096
on a false assumption.

31:10.377 --> 31:13.040
This is the most important
breakthrough in five years.

31:13.140 --> 31:17.164
-Mm-hmm.
-How did you even think
of this ecological minutia?

31:17.264 --> 31:19.266
Because I'm smart. [chuckles]

31:21.948 --> 31:24.010
What, you think
I cheated or something?

31:24.110 --> 31:27.013
No, of course not. Apologies.

31:27.113 --> 31:29.976
Look, the point is,
no more wallowing
or drugging yourself

31:30.076 --> 31:33.419
or feeding yourself
to the alligator, okay?

31:33.519 --> 31:35.722
If we don't figure this out,
no one will.

31:44.090 --> 31:45.591
There's no way around it.

31:45.691 --> 31:47.693
We have to get her body.

31:48.214 --> 31:49.835
Wait, what?

31:49.935 --> 31:51.837
We need to dig up Vida.

31:51.937 --> 31:53.839
No. No, no, no, no.

31:53.939 --> 31:55.681
That was not
what I was saying here.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.803
We need her body to see if
there's evidence of seawater.

31:57.903 --> 31:59.725
You can't just dig somebody up.

31:59.825 --> 32:01.006
There are rules against that.

32:01.106 --> 32:02.608
Oh, please, it's Florida.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.209
Nobody's protecting
dead bodies.

32:04.309 --> 32:06.131
Dead bodies
don't vote. [chuckles]

32:06.231 --> 32:08.233
Sometimes they do vote.

32:10.315 --> 32:13.318
Okay, with the understanding
that no one can
predict the future,

32:14.359 --> 32:15.700
what do you think?

32:15.800 --> 32:19.224
Is there any chance,
if we solve this thing,

32:19.324 --> 32:23.288
that you might, um,
move on and become
a semi-functioning guy?

32:30.855 --> 32:32.857
You are a fascinating woman.

32:33.978 --> 32:35.980
[quirky music playing]

32:36.821 --> 32:38.823
Yes, I am.

32:46.430 --> 32:49.854
Just so you know, I like Bell,

32:49.954 --> 32:53.057
but when you start digging up
decomposed bodies for someone,

32:53.157 --> 32:54.698
you gotta ask yourself,

32:54.798 --> 32:56.340
"What's my line
for saying no to this guy?"

32:56.440 --> 32:58.662
Well, maybe
I'm enjoying myself too.

32:58.762 --> 33:00.764
Do you have a crush on him?

33:01.365 --> 33:04.988
Seriously,
Mr. Doctor Fancy Shoes?

33:05.088 --> 33:06.710
You think
I'm a teenager or something?

33:06.810 --> 33:09.853
No, I'm a single mom.
Single moms don't get crushes.

33:11.254 --> 33:13.476
-That wasn't a no.
-[scoffs]

33:13.576 --> 33:15.318
Officer Lorde.

33:15.418 --> 33:17.400
What an unpleasant surprise.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.722
[Cammie] Yeah, yeah.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.824
Who knew a hearse could do 80?

33:21.504 --> 33:23.006
Surprised me too.

33:23.106 --> 33:24.888
I was late to a funeral.

33:24.988 --> 33:27.810
I didn't know
it was possible for a body
to be late to a funeral.

33:27.910 --> 33:29.812
Yeah, well,
we're not here about tickets.

33:29.912 --> 33:31.994
We need to, uh,
relocate a decedent.

33:34.677 --> 33:37.540
Her husband wants
his beloved wife's remains

33:37.640 --> 33:40.883
to be transferred
to their family burial plot.

33:42.004 --> 33:43.586
I'm sorry,

33:43.686 --> 33:46.428
but for a disinterment
and relocation,

33:46.528 --> 33:48.310
the next of kin
needs to appear in person.

33:48.410 --> 33:50.192
I understand that.

33:50.292 --> 33:52.995
This is Mr. Prescott's
personal physician,

33:53.095 --> 33:55.197
Dr. Otis Wright.

33:55.297 --> 33:57.920
Mr. Prescott's
designated me as his proxy.

33:58.020 --> 34:00.022
He suffers
from acute agoraphobia.

34:05.467 --> 34:08.330
If I can rely
on your discretion,

34:08.430 --> 34:11.613
I'll confide in you
the truth about his condition.

34:11.713 --> 34:15.196
He has a rare strain of
antibiotic-resistant syphilis.

34:16.237 --> 34:17.459
If he appeared in person,

34:17.559 --> 34:19.560
he could create a disturbance.

34:20.281 --> 34:23.544
He spits, occasionally bites,

34:23.644 --> 34:25.146
soils himself,

34:25.246 --> 34:27.248
and sometimes even,

34:27.768 --> 34:29.750
I'm sad to say,

34:29.850 --> 34:31.852
eats the contents.

34:33.494 --> 34:35.476
Yeah, we think
arm's length is better.

34:35.576 --> 34:36.477
[Otis] Mm.

34:36.577 --> 34:38.579
[whimsical music playing]

34:45.506 --> 34:47.287
You know,
there's a version of this where
you don't have to be here.

34:47.387 --> 34:49.209
I'll survive.

34:49.309 --> 34:50.971
I took a smidge of ketamine.

34:51.071 --> 34:53.013
Just a taste.

34:53.113 --> 34:54.494
I am coping wonderfully.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.596
[sighs] Okay.

35:01.081 --> 35:03.083
[sinister music playing]

35:05.165 --> 35:07.167
[Cammie] Whoa.

35:11.371 --> 35:13.373
Hi, honey. I'm home.

35:17.577 --> 35:20.039
All those hours of Pilates
for this.

35:20.139 --> 35:22.141
Oh, but my hair held up.

35:23.102 --> 35:24.604
[Darby] Poor Vida.

35:24.704 --> 35:26.926
-She didn't deserve this.
-No, I did not.

35:27.026 --> 35:29.128
I mean,
she could be a grade-A bitch.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.010
[both] Darby.

35:31.110 --> 35:32.731
So what are we looking for?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.653
Anything that
puts her at the beach
the night of the murder.

35:34.753 --> 35:36.615
We can look,

35:36.715 --> 35:39.158
but I'm guessing not much
survived the embalming process.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.821
You know, I considered
extreme embalming.

35:42.921 --> 35:45.704
In Puerto Rico,
they call it "el muerto parao."

35:45.804 --> 35:48.747
That's "dead man standing."

35:48.847 --> 35:52.110
It's a combination
of pipes and formaldehyde.

35:52.210 --> 35:55.914
I was gonna have her posed
with a credit card in one hand
and a daiquiri in the other.

35:56.014 --> 35:58.336
[giggling]

36:02.340 --> 36:04.122
You sure you're okay?

36:04.222 --> 36:07.225
No, but I can do this.

36:10.148 --> 36:12.150
Vida never wore nail polish.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.832
Girlfriends notice everything.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.296
Husbands... do not.

36:18.396 --> 36:21.559
Otis, take the polish off,
and don't let the acetone
leach under.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.141
