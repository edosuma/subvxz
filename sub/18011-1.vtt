WEBVTT

01:14.300 --> 01:17.300
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.100
That's one small step for man...

01:46.700 --> 01:49.800
...one giant leap for mankind.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.500
Good morning, Sunshine.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.900
- Is your sister awake?
- I don't know where she is.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.000
You look like you had a wild night.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.800
- Well, good morning, Your Majesty.
- Good morning.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.500
This time, no circles on my pancakes.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.600
Here we go.
You guys are loopy in the morning.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.200
I don't know about
all this free-range stuff.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.600
I had a calf headed for California.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.400
- There's circles on my pancake.
- Eat your breakfast, please.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.500
- I don't like Jupiter.
- I'm sorry, honey.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.700
It started out as Venus, and it grew.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.300
- I'm not gonna eat it.
- I'm not gonna eat it.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.500
Girls.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.200
You see, the planets are just not aligned.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.600
- Is Shepard up yet?
- No, I think he's still sleeping.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.600
- Morning, sleepyhead.
- Dad.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.700
You got an e-mail from
that weirdo at FuelFourU.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.900
All right. I think we may have our fuel.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.600
What do you think about this sweater
for my dad?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.900
- I'd divorce you.
- Is it the color?

03:58.900 --> 04:01.300
Why don't you buy him
a new arc welder?

04:01.900 --> 04:05.100
You want me to wrap that up,
or should I just give it to you?

04:05.100 --> 04:08.600
What makes you think your dad
would wear a pink turtleneck?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.600
The color is salmon.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.700
That's the color
on the inside of a salmon.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.399
I don't even think a fish
would wear that color on the outside.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.800
Arc welder.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.800
Here we are.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.500
So is my favorite customer coming in?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.100
Well, you gonna loan me a cup of coffee?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.400
Depends on how you're gonna
pay me back.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.800
Oh, how's rocket man?

04:51.800 --> 04:54.700
- He's fine, Frank. Fine.
- We're taking bets.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.400
Really? What are the odds?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.600
The bet is your husband
will never do it...

05:00.600 --> 05:03.200
...or he's gonna blow himself up.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.000
Nice.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.800
Yeah, we're all gonna become rich
on Farmer's failure.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.900
What bet do you wanna cover?

05:12.300 --> 05:14.500
Why don't you cover this, Frank?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.400
This space suit will allow me to control...

05:20.400 --> 05:23.200
...the climate and the pressure
that you need to be in space.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.900
It's kind of like having your own
personal weather inside here.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.800
Because in space, it's very, very cold.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.100
Is there any questions?

05:33.200 --> 05:37.200
Why don't you just put your hands down,
and we'll just kind of wing it here.

05:37.300 --> 05:40.100
- Start here in the front. You.
- Did you buy it at Target?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.600
No, I didn't buy it at Target.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
Where did you get it?

05:43.600 --> 05:47.600
Actually, someone was throwing it away,
and I just picked it up.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.400
Have you been to space?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
No, not yet.

05:55.300 --> 05:59.100
Stanley has been telling everyone
about their daddy the astronaut.

05:59.800 --> 06:03.800
We need more parents
willing to play dress-up...

06:03.900 --> 06:07.500
...to encourage the kids
to activate their imaginations.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.700
Yes, ma'am.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.700
So many parents just resort
to dressing up as clowns.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.600
You've set a high standard
with this costume.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.500
Well, I appreciate that.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.100
You have a good day.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.100
FuelFourU?

06:45.700 --> 06:46.900
Apollo 13?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.500
You never know
with these online screen names.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.400
I really appreciate you coming out here.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.800
Breakdown for you here.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.600
Ten thousand pounds of fuel.
Is this correct?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.900
- You planning on launching a rocket?
- Yeah.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.100
- You're shitting me, right?
- No.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.000
- Something the matter?
- Well...

07:18.600 --> 07:24.500
...ten pounds, 20 pounds, maybe even
a hundred, that's not a problem.

07:24.500 --> 07:28.500
Ten thousand pounds,
ten thousand problems.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.000
- When do you need it?
- What's the damage?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.800
Fifty grand.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.900
Cash.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.600
You're delinquent
on six mortgage payments already?

07:44.500 --> 07:48.000
I don't know if you understand
how close you are to a foreclosure.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.900
I don't think you understand
how close I am to launching.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.100
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.500
Arnie, it's an emergency, okay?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.300
Oh, do I know it's an emergen--

07:57.300 --> 08:00.200
We probably have 15 emergencies
written down right here.

08:02.300 --> 08:05.700
Twenty. Twenty credit extensions.
Who on earth gets 20?

08:06.100 --> 08:08.600
I assumed more than half that debt
from my dad.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.400
And the bank assumes
that you're gonna pay it back.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.100
Can I give you some advice?

08:14.100 --> 08:16.800
I have no money to pay
for that advice, Arnie.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.200
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your business.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.700
- Well, then don't.
- But I have to...

08:21.700 --> 08:26.100
...because I'm your friend first
and a banker second, all right?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.000
Now, folks around here,
they think you're crazy.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.900
I happen to think you're a genius.

08:30.900 --> 08:35.400
You got bad credit,
but you got great character...

08:37.299 --> 08:40.500
...and that rocket ship of yours
is amazing.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.700
But as a friend, I have to
look you in the eye and say that...

08:45.700 --> 08:48.400
...I think it's time you give it a rest.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.200
Bye, Arnold.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.000
I need a payment, Farmer!

09:24.100 --> 09:25.600
Okay.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.900
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing a balloon.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.500
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing an oxygen tank.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.400
- I believe you're going to the moon.
- I'm going to the moon...

09:37.400 --> 09:40.300
- ...and I'm bringing Mr. Grump.
- No. But not on the table.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.000
- You can't bring your hamster to the moon.
- Yes, I can.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.100
Yes, she can.
I believe she's going to the moon.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.700
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm gonna bring sugar.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.500
Hey, sweetie, the objective is
to connect a common theme...

09:56.500 --> 09:58.600
...based on what Daddy's bringing.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.700
So I'm sorry, you can't go to the moon.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.400
I never get to go.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.700
Okay, my turn.

10:04.700 --> 10:09.500
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing Sunshine.

10:09.900 --> 10:14.400
Well, since she holds air, I believe
we're all going to the moon.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.300
- What is that button for, Daddy?
- Oh, that button?

10:18.300 --> 10:21.000
You girls better hang on.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.300
We're taking off! We're taking off!

10:23.600 --> 10:26.600
Oh, here we are. We're in space.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.200
Isn't it beautiful out there?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.400
Okay, what's that button for?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
- That one?
- Yeah.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.500
That's a very special button too.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.100
That's the one that brings Daddy home.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.800
We have to have that one,
because if Daddy didn't have that button...

10:40.500 --> 10:43.700
...I'd be up there for a long, long time.

10:43.700 --> 10:47.700
Stanley, Sunshine, time for bed.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.200
- Give me a hug, my angels.
- Good night.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.700
Good night. Good night, sweetheart.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.600
See you in a little bit.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.900
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.500
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

11:01.900 --> 11:05.900
I just don't know if these gadgets
are gonna work until I launch, you know.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.300
You don't believe I'm gonna launch it,
do you?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.700
I always believe
you're gonna launch the rocket.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.600
- Someday.
- Well, someday's coming fast.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.400
- Charlie, it's so late.
- I've been working, baby.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.900
Charles, you didn't even take a shower.
You smell like the rocket.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.900
- You could've washed your hands.
- I did. I washed my hands.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.600
Look at this.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.500
Look at that.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.000
Honey, where's your w--?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.700
Where's your wedding ring?

12:11.700 --> 12:13.800
It's in the capsule somewhere.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.500
- Oh, man, in the capsule somewhere.
- Well, honey, I--

12:17.700 --> 12:21.200
Well, it came off.
I'll get it. Don't worry about it.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.600
No, that's not a star.
That's a shooting star.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.400
How come you guys
only eat the marshmallows?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.200
- You don't like the cereal?
- Tastes like wood.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.600
Here, a whole spoonful of marshmallows.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.400
Yeah, but one piece of a cereal.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.600
One piece of a cereal.
Okay, we gotta get that. Oh, there we go.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.500
You know what you guys started me on?

12:44.500 --> 12:48.000
I don't put milk on my cereal anymore,
and it's your fault.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.400
- I don't put milk on my cereal.
- Oh, hey, honey.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.800
Hey. Look who's here.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.400
Hey. Whoa, easy, easy.
Take it easy.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Go ahead, sweetie.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
- Go say hi.
- What are you feeding them?

13:02.400 --> 13:06.700
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Girls. My little tiny people.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.000
Hey, Hal. How you feeling?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.900
I'm actually feeling fine.

13:11.900 --> 13:16.700
- Come sit down, Hal. Come on.
- Here, Grandpa will walk you over, okay?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.800
Boy, you've made real progress.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.500
Yep.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.400
It's gonna take a hell of a lot
more than gunpowder...

13:28.400 --> 13:31.500
...to get this particular aircraft in the air.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.900
Yep.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.400
I never knew it was this big.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.300
Well, you got yourself
some mighty pricey metal here, bud.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.700
Yeah, well, you gotta
have the good stuff.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.100
I'd have more than a carpet burn on my ass
if I didn't protect it.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.900
Farmer?

13:55.300 --> 13:58.400
Hey, Karl. How you doing, man?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.000
I'm gonna need your autograph
for this letter.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.800
Goddamn, it certainly gets my attention.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.400
- Appreciate it. I'll see you later, buddy.
- See you.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.800
What--?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.600
- Farmer!
- You want my house...

14:40.600 --> 14:43.800
- ...I'll give it to you brick by brick.
- It was procedure, Farmer.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.000
I didn't have a choice.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.100
The bank wouldn't stand for it
a day longer, and neither would I.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.600
You're way too overextended.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.400
You're just a banker.
A friend wouldn't do what you did.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.900
If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't
have sent it in. You got 30 days.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.500
Open your eyes. Look at this as
a wake-up call, because the dream is over.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.800
It's gotta stop now,
before you lose everything.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.500
Farmer.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.600
What's up, Chopper? How's your daddy?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.900
Waiting for you. Want a ride?

15:10.900 --> 15:13.100
No, it's all right. Follow me.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.200
What'd you do, Arnie?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.500
How much does he owe the bank,
Arnold?

15:23.900 --> 15:26.400
- Over 600,000 dollars.
- 600,000 dollars?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.900
He's dangerous. He threw a brick at me.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.400
That's enough, Arnold. That's enough.
Will the bank take an apology?

15:33.900 --> 15:37.200
- Well?
- I guess...

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
Farmer, give the bank an apology.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.900
Say you're sorry.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.500
- Arnold, I'm sorry.
- Great.

15:49.500 --> 15:55.200
Now, Arnold, I'm going to administer
Farmer's spanking in private.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.200
Chopper, could you
see Arnold out for me?

16:03.900 --> 16:05.200
Assume the position.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.800
You're not really gonna whack me
with that thing, are you?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.400
Come on. I've known you all your life.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.400
But I do see you putting your family
and yourself at serious risk.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.400
One day it's a brick,
the next day it's a bullet.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.100
Men have been known
to do desperate things...

16:23.100 --> 16:24.800
...when they're losing their ranches.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.000
I'm gonna ask you to get...

16:28.700 --> 16:31.600
...a psychiatric evaluation.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.000
Before Arnold and me are comfortable
with you in society, you gotta see a shrink.

16:36.900 --> 16:41.300
Go over to the school, see Nurse Goode
over there, and talk to her.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.000
Bring it back to me.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.800
What'd they get you for?

16:54.400 --> 16:56.500
Sleeping in class.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.600
How about you?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.300
I broke a window.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.599
So, what do you wanna be
when you get out of here?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.000
I don't know.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.800
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.000
Well, let me tell you something...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.500
...you better know what you wanna do
before somebody knows it for you.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.000
Trust me.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.700
Farmer. Nurse Goode can see you now.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.300
Okay.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.000
Well, good luck.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.400
Charlie Farmer.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.900
Hey, Beth. I was supposed to
give you this, the judge said.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.300
Thank you. Okay.

17:44.400 --> 17:49.400
Don't you think that they're a little late
in labeling you crazy?

17:49.700 --> 17:51.500
Jumping off a bridge is crazy.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.200
- Oh, and building a rocket isn't.
- I threw a brick through a window.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.600
That's why I'm here.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
Well, how would you like it if we discussed
your desire to leave the planet?

18:00.900 --> 18:03.300
- Not particularly.
- Oh, Charlie.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.000
I don't expect you to open up
and start talking in our very first session.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.800
Session? There's sessions?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.200
We're all onions, Charlie.

18:14.200 --> 18:19.800
We have many, many,
many layers to get through.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.300
See what I'm saying? And, just like...

18:23.200 --> 18:26.800
...well, when you peel an onion,
there may be tears as we come--

18:26.800 --> 18:29.000
Beth, please stop it, okay?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.800
Listen, my daddy never told me
that he loved me.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.700
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
that your daddy never did either.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.500
The resentment that you feel
towards your parents...

18:40.500 --> 18:43.500
...is not going to fuel your rocket.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.800
- Are you done?
- Well, you're not getting it.

18:47.800 --> 18:53.800
The rocket is not going to bring you
a happy childhood.

18:53.800 --> 18:59.500
We all just have to grow up
and just take responsibility.

18:59.500 --> 19:03.400
Remember during our high school prom,
I asked you go to the moon with me?

19:08.900 --> 19:14.400
Well, shoot, Charlie,
that was just about getting laid.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.900
Well, I'm still going.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.700
We're not done, Charlie.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.600
Is this considered another session?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.900
Have you ever thought
of going into teaching?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.100
What the hell would I teach?
What not to do?

19:29.100 --> 19:33.100
No. Charlie, you could inspire
some young kid to do what you can't.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.600
But I can, and I will, Beth.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.200
I hate to be the one breaking it to you,
but you are not an astronaut.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
It didn't happen, and that's okay.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.600
You know,
the military's not for everyone...

19:44.600 --> 19:47.400
...but we all just still love you,
and you didn't fail...

19:47.400 --> 19:49.800
- ...and don't look at it that way.
- Oh, I don't.

19:50.500 --> 19:54.200
- Oh, my God, do you need help.
- Yes, you're right, I do need help.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.200
I need to find Shepard
because I gotta launch in 30 days.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.800
You have to find a way
to channel your anger...

19:59.800 --> 20:03.300
...or else it will manifest itself
into something...

20:03.300 --> 20:05.100
...like, you know, a rocket ship.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.200
Charlie Farmer.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.600
Ms. Graham, I'm here to inspire a kid.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.900
I could use an engineer
such as yourself at the house.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.900
Why don't you get your things,
and let's go.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.200
Excuse me, but we're in the middle
of a history lesson.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.900
I apologize, Ms. Graham, but you're
teaching him how to read history...

20:24.900 --> 20:28.800
...and I'm gonna show him how to make it.
You have a good day, hon.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.400
- Where are we going?
- Home.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
Home? Do we see the--?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.800
Where's the house?
I don't see it anywhere.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.700
Well, it's a long ways to home.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.800
Every one of you is now part
of the Farmer space program.

20:42.800 --> 20:47.400
If anyone feels that he or she is not fit
to be in the Farmer space program...

20:47.400 --> 20:49.700
...then you should say your piece now.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Does that mean we don't
have to go to school?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.900
Correct.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.200
But every morning,
we're gonna hold class...

20:56.200 --> 20:58.300
...and study your regular subjects...

20:58.300 --> 21:00.800
...so when you return to school,
you won't be behind.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.900
- Yes, sir.
- Any questions?

21:04.300 --> 21:09.000
- Is that all?
- No, honey, not yet.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.800
How big is it?

21:12.800 --> 21:15.400
- It's big.
- Big?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.800
- So you've seen it?
- Of course I have.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.100
And you think that he'll let me see it?

21:22.700 --> 21:25.700
- Depends.
- Depends? On what?

21:25.700 --> 21:29.400
It's not like I'm gonna go
running all over town, "I've seen it."

21:36.400 --> 21:39.700
I'm telling. You told.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.400
Hey. You and Phyllis been out playing?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.600
What's going on?

21:55.900 --> 21:58.000
Why aren't the children in school?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.500
I'll address your issues after the briefing.
We're not quite finished.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.300
Charles, you need to answer my question.
What's going on?

22:05.100 --> 22:07.700
Oh, hey, Hal. You wanna
be part of the program?

22:07.700 --> 22:09.900
- Sir?
- The space program.

22:11.700 --> 22:15.700
- Charles. Bye, Phyllis.
- You guys are released, okay?

22:16.000 --> 22:19.100
I want you here tomorrow morning
at 0500 sharp, okay?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.500
Now, go back to the house. All right.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.100
They're going back to school tomorrow.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.400
It's five weeks maximum,
and they're back at school, I promise you.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.900
You know that they're never gonna
get the kind of education at school...

22:30.900 --> 22:32.100
...that they can get here.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.300
They don't even teach science
in these schools anymore.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.800
You know what Shepard's science teacher
said to him? I mean, get this.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.100
She said, "Science isn't sexy."

22:41.500 --> 22:45.800
I mean, do you want your girls to grow up
only knowing when Mercury's in retrograde?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.500
- You know?
- What the hell happened to you?

22:48.500 --> 22:53.400
It's five weeks maximum, and then
they're back in school, I promise. Okay?

23:08.300 --> 23:09.500
Unit 4-0 to Central.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.500
Do we know how many entrances
there are to this property?

23:12.500 --> 23:15.800
I believe there are four entrances
to the property. Four entrances.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.400
I don't know if they're gated or not.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.700
Suspect has been trying
to secure rocket fuel, over.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.700
Roger, we copy.
Miller is about 100 yards out.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.900
You should be able to see him.
He's coming down the hill, over.

23:30.900 --> 23:34.900
Be aware there are seven suspects. We have
on visual suspect, one Jesus Garcia.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.100
We copy that.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.700
Killbourne, Mathis,
currently securing the barn.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.100
Can I help you?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.900
- Charles Farmer?
- Yeah.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.600
We're with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.600
Sir, we have been made aware,
through electronic documents...

24:14.600 --> 24:18.600
...that you have been searching
for a high-grade fuel commonly used...

24:20.300 --> 24:21.900
...to launch rockets.

24:21.900 --> 24:25.700
Are you aware that you have an illegal
alien working on your premises?

24:25.700 --> 24:28.900
Pepe Garcia. Jesus Garcia.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.400
If you cooperate, we could see to it...

24:31.400 --> 24:34.500
...that Mr. Garcia
could stay here with your family.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.000
We're going to the moon.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.200
- That's really rotten.
- It's rather generous of us.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.100
And where is that man going?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.900
It's very simple, Mr. Farmer...

24:46.900 --> 24:50.600
...it's illegal to try to obtain
such a high-grade fuel for private use.

24:50.600 --> 24:54.300
Anyone trying to acquire this kind of fuel
has to be considered a threat.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.400
This is the real deal.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.300
- Well, I'm no threat.
- Well, how do we know...

24:58.300 --> 25:01.400
- ...you're not building a warhead?
- Because I'm not at war.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.700
We just wanna let you know
your little rocket ain't gonna fly...

25:05.700 --> 25:08.100
...as long as we're doing
this investigation.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.600
Yeah.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.300
I filled out the FAA application,
sent it in over six months ago.

25:28.300 --> 25:31.300
Sent all my flight plans,
illustrations of the vessel...

25:31.300 --> 25:34.200
...never heard anything back
saying I couldn't launch.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.600
They didn't think you were serious.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.600
- Well, how can they stop me now?
- Jeez, Farmer.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.200
With this Patriot Act, the way
they've twisted the laws up so much...

25:44.200 --> 25:46.200
...they can do whatever
they please...

25:46.200 --> 25:49.800
...as long as they feel you're a threat
to homeland security.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.800
What do you want me to do?

25:51.800 --> 25:55.000
Well, twist it some more.
Isn't that what lawyers are good at?

25:56.100 --> 25:59.300
All right. Did they say they were
gonna press any charges?

25:59.300 --> 26:02.000
Well, no, not exactly.
They said I'm under investigation.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.600
That means they're gonna
be watching your every move.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.800
Yeah.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.900
I got a buddy in Manhattan.

26:12.900 --> 26:17.700
He's a partner in one of these big firms
that specializes in cases like this.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.000
- Give it a try.
- Maybe he can...

26:21.000 --> 26:23.400
...shed some light on the situation.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.800
He owes me a favor.
It won't cost you a nickel.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.600
Set it up. Grab the boom.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.500
Going into space
doesn't take NASA anymore.

26:32.500 --> 26:36.500
Friends, we are here at the entrance
of the space cowboy's ranch.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.400
We are told that behind me,
in this barn, is a rocket...

26:40.400 --> 26:45.400
...a rocket that Charles Farmer
wants to launch into outer space.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.900
After graduating
from Meriwether Lewis High School...

26:47.900 --> 26:50.800
...he continued his education
at the University of Texas...

26:50.800 --> 26:54.200
...where he received a degree
in aerospace engineering.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.400
Soon after, Charles Farmer
enlisted in the Air Force...

26:57.400 --> 27:01.800
...where he developed his skills as a pilot,
flying such planes as the F-4 Phantom.

27:02.300 --> 27:06.300
The rocketeer Charles Farmer
was in fact training to be an astronaut...

27:06.400 --> 27:08.900
...before he was discharged
from the military.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.400
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up?

27:10.400 --> 27:13.300
Holy cow, Munchak.
You didn't tell me your friend was CNN.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.100
This is what he said.
He said embrace the media, Farmer.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.100
Invite them in.
They're for your protection.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.200
You want them on your side, Farmer.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.300
All right.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.200
He built the rocket.
I'm sure he built a retractable roof.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.500
- Really?
- I don't think he'd build a rocket...

27:28.500 --> 27:29.900
...and forget about the roof.

27:31.700 --> 27:35.500
- Unless he never plans on launching it.
- Then why are we here?

27:36.100 --> 27:38.800
Because if we aren't here,
and he launches...

27:39.900 --> 27:41.600
...we're gonna look like asses.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.900
And if he does, and we are here?

27:46.100 --> 27:48.600
We still look like asses.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.400
- There he is!
- Mr. Farmer!

27:57.200 --> 27:59.000
Mr. Farmer, quick question.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.800
Listen, if you guys settle down
and ask your questions one at a time...

28:04.800 --> 28:07.300
...I'll answer them
to the best of my ability.

28:07.300 --> 28:11.200
Is it important to you that people know
the importance of space travel?

28:11.200 --> 28:14.700
I'll put it to you this way.
There are a lot of people in this world...

28:14.700 --> 28:17.500
...that think Michael Jackson
had the first moonwalk.

28:17.500 --> 28:20.100
Mr. Farmer, when do you plan
on launching your rocket?

28:20.100 --> 28:22.500
- Soon.
- Mr. Farmer, why are you doing this?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.500
It's always been my dream.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.800
The rocket is huge. It's really big.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.400
He's more of an astro-nut.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.000
- Who was it?
- My wife.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.100
She wants an autograph.

28:52.100 --> 28:56.100
You hear about this? There's a guy in Texas
building his own rocket in his back yard.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.800
This guy is planning
on launching himself into orbit.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.700
Here's my question.
Wouldn't it be easier just to say:

29:03.700 --> 29:06.400
"Honey, I want a divorce"?
Okay, wouldn't that be--?

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
That's not very funny.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.000
Looks like a really beautiful day today.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.500
Afternoon high of 65,
down to 35 tonight.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.300
- Morning, Hal.
- And if you're launching a rocket...

29:18.300 --> 29:21.200
...the weather looks really good
over most of the country.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.800
This is what's known
as the rocket graveyard.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.800
Farmer gathered most of what he needed
from places like this.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.900
If you're looking to build a rocket,
this is the place to start.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.500
Farmer's rocket is housed
in the barn that you're seeing below.

29:37.500 --> 29:41.100
Due to the overwhelming interest,
he has opened his barn to the public...

29:41.100 --> 29:43.500
...allowing them
to view the rocket themselves...

29:43.500 --> 29:45.900
...only hoping to alleviate
some of this congestion.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.800
Can he do it? Well, sure he can.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.100
Now, will he do it? That's to be seen.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.600
There are lots of FAA regulations...

29:54.600 --> 29:58.200
...that keep people from turning
the sky into a playground.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.500
But the astronaut's plans
for space travel...

30:00.500 --> 30:04.300
...first have to be approved by the FAA.
A hearing has been scheduled.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.400
How long will the government
not allow you to launch your rocket?

30:07.400 --> 30:09.400
- They're not stopping me.
- Is it true...

30:09.400 --> 30:12.600
...Elton John plans to re-release
"Rocket Man" to help raise money?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.500
This is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.000
Let's get what we can on this guy.
Find something.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.900
We gotta get this space cowboy's
head out of the clouds.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.100
Pack up, boys. We're going to Texas.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.200
Well, the man deserves a second chance.

30:28.700 --> 30:29.900
All right, more presents.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.600
That's the last of it.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.100
Hey, Stanley.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.400
Why don't you change your hamster cage?
Use paper--

30:40.400 --> 30:44.000
Now, wait a minute. I'd like to see that.
Come on, let me have a look.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.600
Don't believe everything you read,
honey. It just...

30:46.600 --> 30:49.100
- I wanna read it.
- I wish she had your paper, Pepe.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.700
She can't read Spanish.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.800
Your dad's right.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.500
- Change your hamster cage.
- Okay.

30:58.800 --> 31:03.200
They called us a cult. They said we were
like a branch of the Moonies or something.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.600
They think our family's
a bunch of space cadets.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.000
I know. I know.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.800
- How can they do that?
- Because they can.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.700
We are a normal family. We need
to go tell everyone that it isn't true.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.700
Well, honey, we just need
to show them, okay?

31:34.300 --> 31:36.300
We got a winner here. It's a winner!

31:36.300 --> 31:38.500
Hey, here you go, bud.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.800
That's what I get?

32:34.400 --> 32:36.800
Don't you worry about them.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.900
Just forget about them, Charles.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.100
- Thank you.
- For what, baby?

33:03.100 --> 33:04.700
For this.

33:19.300 --> 33:23.900
Excuse me. I wanna talk to you
about the ride.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.100
Two tickets.

33:26.100 --> 33:31.200
No, sir. I mean, if I wanted to buy this ride
from you, how much would it cost me?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.800
Well, you can rent it for 500 a week.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.900
- Can we talk some business?
- Sure.

33:36.900 --> 33:40.100
- Yeah?
- Absolutely. You gonna be around?

33:40.100 --> 33:41.300
Yeah, I'll be here.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.700
Colonel Masterson.

34:17.699 --> 34:21.699
Up there in space, you get
a totally different perspective.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.900
Different every time.

34:24.900 --> 34:28.900
Different perspective of the Earth.
Different perspective of yourself.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.100
Every time's completely different.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.400
It's just...

34:34.100 --> 34:36.600
It's just beautiful, is what it is.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.100
Beautiful.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.400
You see the world, and you realize
how small we all are.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.199
Life-changing.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.000
Definitely life-changing.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.699
This is good chicken, Audrey.

34:51.699 --> 34:54.199
- Thank you.
- You're about to make me start crying.

34:57.100 --> 35:01.700
My last mission was on the Endeavor.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
I don't know who they are.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.300
It's the name of the space shuttle
Colonel Masterson flew on.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.600
We don't have a name for our rocket.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.700
You don't?

35:13.800 --> 35:16.200
You don't have a name
for your rocket, Farmer?

35:16.200 --> 35:18.700
Well, we just hadn't got to that part yet.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.400
We're gonna have to think of some
names, aren't we?

35:21.400 --> 35:22.500
Sunshine?

35:24.200 --> 35:26.300
- Licorice.
- Licorice?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.300
Okay, who's for Licorice?

35:34.100 --> 35:35.300
Okay.

35:35.300 --> 35:39.900
Now, Stanley submitted the name
of the Rockin' Rocket.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.500
- Who wants Rockin' Rocket?
- I like that.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.100
Uncle Eddie has voted
for everything we've said so far.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.900
- I'm taking this as seriously as you are.
- Okay.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.900
Now, Shepard has decided,
as you told me before...

35:52.900 --> 35:55.900
- ...you wanna change your name?
- Yeah, I'm changing my name.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.400
I'll think about it more.
I'm not sure what I want.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.300
Okay. Pepe.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.000
What does that mean?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
It ain't gonna be the name of the rocket,
so don't worry.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.600
What does it mean, though?
Because if we're all going to vote on it--

36:24.600 --> 36:26.900
It means "the other woman," honey.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.900
No. You are not voting for that name.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.600
I think we should go out
and see the other woman.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.100
Son of a bitch, Farmer.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.800
- You built this thing?
- Bolt by bolt.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.700
That is some serious engineering.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.900
You don't think they'd have
brought you down here...

37:18.900 --> 37:21.100
...if it was a bottle rocket, do you?

37:21.100 --> 37:23.200
Good grief.

37:25.300 --> 37:28.700
- You're serious about this.
- Absolutely.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.900
Lookie here, you.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.300
What happens...

37:48.000 --> 37:50.900
...if the rocket doesn't launch?

37:52.200 --> 37:56.000
I know it's not the company line here.
I know.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.600
But I'm a dad, baby.

38:01.200 --> 38:07.000
Well, that's why he needs our support
regardless of the outcome.

38:10.100 --> 38:12.000
It's not mandatory.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.900
No, it's love.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.200
What do you think?

38:43.700 --> 38:48.600
I think that it is gonna be one sad-ass day
up here in Farmerville...

38:48.600 --> 38:51.600
...when they haul all your hard work
off to the junkyard.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.500
I think that. What do you think?

38:58.300 --> 39:02.300
You think they're gonna let you
go up into outer space?

39:02.300 --> 39:03.800
A civilian?

39:04.300 --> 39:06.600
They don't let civilians
go up into outer space.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.900
Astronauts go into outer space.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.200
Professional astronauts
who have been trained...

39:11.200 --> 39:14.000
...to withstand the pressures
and the strain...

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
...and the emotional stress
of leaving your family behind.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.800
Ed, you know my dad died.
That's why I left.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.600
- Of course I know your dad--
- My family needed me.

39:25.600 --> 39:30.500
But if that was a test, you failed.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.400
What do you think NASA was thinking?

39:33.400 --> 39:37.300
This boy's gonna go into outer space.
His dad dies, and he wants to go home.

39:37.300 --> 39:41.600
I thought there's one person on this earth
that might understand, and that's you.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.700
I really-- I really didn't expect this.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.400
What if I told you I could get you
a seat on the shuttle?

39:55.500 --> 39:58.100
I'd say I don't wanna
hitch a ride on the bus.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.800
Forget that. Forget about
hitching a ride on the bus, okay?

40:01.300 --> 40:05.000
Forget the rocket. You forget the rocket
that you put a lot of hard work into.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
You get these people off your back,
get these idiots with cameras out of here...

40:09.000 --> 40:12.500
...then you go up into outer space
the right way.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.400
The safe way.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.900
- You don't think I can do it, do you?
- Forget that.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.900
This is about money.
Not even millions of dollars anymore...

40:21.900 --> 40:25.900
...billions of dollars. 16.2 billion dollars
in this year's budget alone.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
- For what?
- Who cares for what.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.700
For whatever they want.

40:29.700 --> 40:33.100
They're not gonna let you go up
in your John Deere riding lawnmower...

40:33.100 --> 40:35.700
...into outer space
and try and come back down...

40:35.700 --> 40:39.300
...and make them look stupid.
Do you think that's really gonna happen?

40:41.200 --> 40:44.200
Don't answer me now.
I don't want your answer right now.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.800
But I want you to think about it.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.900
Nice rocket, though.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.200
Will Charles Farmer be allowed
to launch his rocket?

41:01.200 --> 41:02.700
That's why we're here today.

41:02.700 --> 41:07.200
The FAA, FBI, CIA, the Department
of Energy, and members of the military.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.800
- They're all here.
- What do you think about all this?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.200
Looks like we got home-field advantage,
don't it?

41:12.200 --> 41:16.000
They're not allowing cameras
or the media inside during the hearing.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.200
We are assembled here
to review an application...

41:49.200 --> 41:51.900
...for the launching of a spacecraft.

41:51.900 --> 41:55.800
We'll be asking a series of questions.
Answer to the best of your knowledge.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.200
Yes, sir.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.000
Let's begin with your flight plan
that you've submitted.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.400
Your plan is to do one complete orbit
of the Earth.

42:03.400 --> 42:08.100
Once completed, the capsule
will re-enter the atmosphere.

42:08.600 --> 42:12.100
Sounds easy. Simple.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.600
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's not.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.800
I would submit that's the gentleman's
opinion, not a statement of fact.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.900
You are aware this is not a court of law.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.300
I am, but I'm not gonna sit here
like a potted plant.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.200
I hope not.

42:27.900 --> 42:31.000
As head of the FAA, my opinion
might have some credence...

42:31.000 --> 42:33.300
- ...on the subject of space flight.
- Yes, sir.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.500
You based your design
on the Atlas rocket, yes?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.600
- Yes, sir.
- Were you aware that the Atlas...

42:39.600 --> 42:42.600
...comes from the design
of a ballistic missile?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.500
- Yes, sir.
- So basically...

42:44.500 --> 42:48.000
- ...you've built a missile in your barn.
- That's incorrect.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.200
Will Beacon, Central Intelligence Agency.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.900
How do we know
that you're not constructing a WMD?

42:57.300 --> 43:01.300
Well, because if I was building
a weapon of mass destruction...

43:01.300 --> 43:02.900
...you wouldn't be able to find it.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.500
- Very funny, Mr. Farmer.
- That's just the truth.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.800
Here we are. Thanks for waiting.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.500
Hi, thanks for waiting.
Can I take your order?

43:19.500 --> 43:23.400
- Audie Farmer? The astronaut's wife?
- Yes, ma'am. What can I get for you?

43:23.400 --> 43:27.000
Gretchen Boyd
from Child Protective Services.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.100
Would you please sit down?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.900
- No, thank you.
- Mrs. Farmer...

43:33.200 --> 43:35.400
...it has come to our attention...

43:35.400 --> 43:40.100
...that your children, as well as yourself,
may be in harm's way.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.300
How so?

43:44.300 --> 43:49.000
Your husband has literally brainwashed
you and your children.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
He's taken them out of school...

43:51.000 --> 43:56.200
...and he has isolated his entire family
from any other outside influence.

43:59.600 --> 44:05.500
It's time you took control of your family
before someone else does it for you.

44:09.100 --> 44:13.100
- Who's your personnel at Mission Control?
- Shepard Farmer, my son.

44:13.200 --> 44:16.500
- Does he have any experience?
- Sure does. Fifteen years.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.500
Is this a joke to you, Mr. Farmer?

44:18.500 --> 44:21.800
A 15-year-old will be the head
of your mission control?

44:21.800 --> 44:24.600
He's perfectly capable
of launching his dad into space.

44:24.600 --> 44:28.600
- Don't underestimate what my child can do.
- Come on. He's 15 years old.

44:28.800 --> 44:33.400
We also have an evaluation that was
done recently by a Dr. Beth Goode.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.100
Nurse Goode?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.600
These are alarming comments
made by the doctor.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.200
She said that Mr. Farmer is angry...

44:42.000 --> 44:43.800
...unstable...

44:43.800 --> 44:45.300
...delusional...

44:45.300 --> 44:49.000
...and that his overall mental health
is in question.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.400
Charlie, your father took his own life,
is that correct?

44:57.300 --> 44:59.400
Don't go there, colonel.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.100
I can tell you right now,
what you have built here...

45:14.100 --> 45:17.000
...is a one-way ticket to the afterlife.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.200
A facility in which Mr. Farmer
could get himself into space.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.800
The U.S. government
has a space program, Mr. Farmer.

45:22.800 --> 45:25.500
Why don't you just leave this
to the professionals?

45:25.500 --> 45:29.100
In 1960 they started a space race.

45:29.700 --> 45:32.600
By 1969 we were on the moon.

45:33.100 --> 45:36.200
Now, in that short period of time,
look what we accomplished.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.200
And in my opinion,
I believe that if some other country...

45:40.200 --> 45:42.400
...wanted to go to the moon
and live there...

45:42.400 --> 45:46.700
...we'd get in a war with them
because we think the moon is ours.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.600
Well, it's not.

45:50.700 --> 45:55.800
Just like it's not your right to tell me
whether or not I can launch into space.

45:56.300 --> 45:57.700
Mr. Farmer, we have laws.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.200
I know we have laws.
We got all kind of laws.

46:00.200 --> 46:03.500
We got more laws to tell us
what we can't do than anything else.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.600
We got laws to protect us
from other laws.

46:06.600 --> 46:10.200
- Comments like that do not help.
- Listen, you've been talking all morning.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.900
Let me talk for a minute.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.500
Okay?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.900
I won't take long.

46:19.700 --> 46:23.500
When I was a kid, they used to tell me
that I could be anything I wanted to be.

46:26.100 --> 46:28.300
No matter what.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.700
And maybe I am insane, I don't know,
but I still believe that.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.600
I believe it with all my heart.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.900
Somewhere along the line...

46:44.200 --> 46:47.700
...we stopped believing
that we could do anything.

46:50.200 --> 46:54.600
And if we don't have our dreams,
we have nothing.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.900
You'll be informed of our decision.

47:12.700 --> 47:14.600
I'm gonna save your life.

47:15.900 --> 47:19.400
I'm gonna tell you something
that no one else in there will tell you.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.300
The U.S. military has enough firepower
pointed at your ranch...

47:23.300 --> 47:25.800
...that if you decide to launch...

47:25.800 --> 47:30.500
...within seconds, your remains
will be spread over five states.

47:33.800 --> 47:37.000
- Is that a threat?
- No.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.000
You're the threat.

47:50.300 --> 47:53.300
Don't believe a word he says, Farmer.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.900
Nobody's gonna fire any missiles at you.

47:55.900 --> 47:59.400
They have no law to stop you,
so they're just trying to intimidate you.

47:59.400 --> 48:00.800
I don't know.

48:02.300 --> 48:06.700
Actually, I think they're pretty good
at assassinating people who have dreams.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.900
Where's your helmet?

48:27.800 --> 48:30.100
Now, I think that's it, Mrs. Farmer.

48:30.100 --> 48:31.400
Thank you.

48:36.600 --> 48:39.600
- So is it true?
- What?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.700
Got a million dollars for your story?

48:42.700 --> 48:44.500
No, Vanessa, it's not true.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.700
I won't tell anyone. I read about it in--

48:46.700 --> 48:48.600
Vanessa, it's not true.

48:50.100 --> 48:52.600
Your total is 86.05.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.800
Sorry. Here.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.200
Watch your fingers.

49:07.300 --> 49:10.900
I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer,
but your card was declined.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.600
Would you like to try another one?

49:16.400 --> 49:18.200
Can you just keep all this here...

49:18.200 --> 49:20.500
...and we'll come back
in a little while, okay?

49:20.500 --> 49:22.400
Come on, girls. Come on.

49:51.300 --> 49:52.900
I'm going to the moon...

49:53.600 --> 49:55.900
...and I'm bringing this brick.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.700
Kids, your mom and I
need a private moment.

50:07.700 --> 50:10.000
No. This has been private long enough.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.700
Now, you can lie to me as much as you
want, Charles, but don't lie to them.

50:15.200 --> 50:16.700
Tell them.

50:17.100 --> 50:20.100
Tell them we might not have a house
in a few weeks.

50:20.100 --> 50:23.200
- Knock it off, Audie, okay, please?
- No, you knock it off.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.500
- Please, knock it off.
- And what was your plan?

50:25.500 --> 50:26.900
Blasting off this Earth...

50:26.900 --> 50:30.400
...and leaving us here to deal with
the consequences? With no money...

50:30.400 --> 50:33.300
- ...nothing, no money for food?
- Oh, really? Is that right?

50:36.700 --> 50:38.100
I'm sorry.

50:40.600 --> 50:43.600
So we don't have any food?
Is that what you think?

50:43.600 --> 50:45.900
Kids, you don't have anything
to worry about...

50:45.900 --> 50:48.300
...because we got plenty of food, okay?

50:48.300 --> 50:49.300
Here's food.

50:49.800 --> 50:53.100
You want macaroni and cheese?
You want salmon in white sauce?

50:53.100 --> 50:55.000
- You want rice pilaf?
- Stop it!

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
- We got all kinds of food!
- Shepard, take the children out of here.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.500
What, do you wanna throw that?
You gonna throw something at me, Audie?

51:06.500 --> 51:11.400
- Is that what you wanna do? Go ahead!
- You wanna see flying saucers?

51:11.400 --> 51:15.200
Don't you ever accuse me of that again
in front of the kids. You understand me?

51:15.200 --> 51:17.900
You're not taking care of us
when we don't have a home!

51:18.500 --> 51:20.600
You have to keep us safe!

51:20.600 --> 51:24.500
And this dream that we all share
feeds one person, and that's you!

51:26.600 --> 51:31.100
You're gonna lose everything, Charles,
including your family.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.100
Now, I need to clean up this kitchen.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.900
I'm sorry I did this.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.900
Audie.

52:10.700 --> 52:14.300
I love you and those kids
more than anything in this world.

52:15.300 --> 52:18.300
But if I don't do what I believe in...

52:21.400 --> 52:25.100
...then I haven't done them
any good at all.

52:30.100 --> 52:32.800
I have always believed.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.400
I just don't know anymore.

53:05.200 --> 53:08.200
Okay. Here we go.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.900
- Hold Mommy's purse.
- Audie?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.600
Audie, honey, you don't have to leave.

53:19.300 --> 53:22.300
It's Sunday. We're going to church.

53:23.400 --> 53:27.200
I'm hoping they'll learn something about
forgiveness, because they'll need it.

53:27.200 --> 53:31.200
- Come on, Audie, don't do that.
- No, Charles. They worship you.

53:31.800 --> 53:34.400
And so that I don't get bitter...

53:34.900 --> 53:37.800
...and call you an ass for lying to us...

53:39.200 --> 53:42.300
...I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to forgive you.

53:43.900 --> 53:45.600
And so will they.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.700
You know, I tell you one thing.

54:02.500 --> 54:06.000
You are one fabulous father.

54:06.900 --> 54:08.700
And you know why, Farmer?

54:09.300 --> 54:14.100
This man couldn't even get his family
to eat dinner together.

54:15.500 --> 54:19.500
But you have got your family...

54:19.900 --> 54:22.300
...dreaming together.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.600
That is big stuff, sir.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.900
Really big stuff.

54:36.100 --> 54:39.600
Boy, they gotta burn a lot of fuel
to run them cars, you know it?

54:42.300 --> 54:45.900
Gotta wonder if all them cars would
be going around in circles like that...

54:45.900 --> 54:48.300
...if they didn't have all that advertising.

54:52.900 --> 54:56.300
The fact of the matter is, Doug,
if you advertise on my rocket...

54:56.300 --> 54:57.900
...it's gonna raise your sales.

54:57.900 --> 55:01.000
It just stands to reason.
Plus, you'll be getting attention...

55:01.000 --> 55:04.300
...that you normally wouldn't get
from conventional methods.

55:04.300 --> 55:07.500
Now, I've got a letter out
to the CEO of Coca-Cola.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.400
I expect to hear back from them soon.

55:09.400 --> 55:12.400
If they come onboard,
they'll be right here.

55:12.400 --> 55:17.400
But before they come on and paint
the whole thing red, you got your choice.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.400
I mean, look at this.

55:20.800 --> 55:22.400
Can you imagine?

55:23.100 --> 55:27.000
Dunkin' Donuts blasting off into space.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.900
What if your mission's aborted...

55:28.900 --> 55:31.900
...or your success doesn't measure
to this final statement?

55:32.300 --> 55:36.000
- What are you implying?
- The risk factor is high, Farmer.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.300
But it's an educated risk.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.600
Did you read the case study on Tang?

55:40.600 --> 55:43.800
The profits they made off putting
that orange dust up onboard.

55:44.300 --> 55:46.900
I've made a graph. Did you look at it?

55:46.900 --> 55:49.400
Oh, yeah, Tang.
I raised three kids on that stuff.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.000
Well, it's full of vitamins.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.600
What's that little old cheesy deal
y'all got now?

55:53.600 --> 55:56.700
I mean, tell me what happens
if your whole mission goes to shit.

55:56.700 --> 56:00.500
- I mean, I can't deal with much more of it.
- You mean, like, if I die?

56:00.500 --> 56:03.600
If something were
to happen to you, Farmer...

56:03.600 --> 56:07.200
...candy sprinkles, M&M's,
Oreo cookies...

56:07.200 --> 56:09.500
...there's no amount of topping...

56:10.300 --> 56:13.600
...that would cover the amount
of guilt that I would have.

56:13.600 --> 56:15.500
Look, if you die...

56:15.500 --> 56:20.200
...the book deal, Good Morning America,
that TV movie, Jay Leno...

56:20.200 --> 56:22.300
...all that vanishes.

56:22.300 --> 56:26.100
Without a successful mission, I don't
see the profits breaking into the red.

56:26.100 --> 56:28.500
I might as well go put my money
in Kleenex stock...

56:29.000 --> 56:32.400
...because all you're gonna be producing
is a ton of tears.

56:33.200 --> 56:35.500
But if you circle the world...

56:35.500 --> 56:39.100
...you land back over in your back yard
like your mission plan says...

56:40.000 --> 56:42.800
...you're a man-made American hero.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.600
Now if I could only launch a rocket
with jelly doughnuts.

56:46.600 --> 56:49.300
Sunshine, why don't you go
give your grandpa one, okay?

56:49.300 --> 56:52.500
He loves the sprinkles.
Take Grandpa a doughnut. There you go.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.700
- Take Grandpa a doughnut.
- Just have two, okay?

56:55.000 --> 56:56.600
Just two.

56:57.300 --> 57:00.400
- Do you want one?
- No, honey, I've already had three or four.

57:00.400 --> 57:02.700
With, like, seven cups of coffee and...

57:04.300 --> 57:06.800
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

57:07.300 --> 57:09.800
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.700
- Grandpa no wake up.
- What, sweetie?

57:20.400 --> 57:22.600
Grandpa no wake up.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.000
Dad?

57:45.100 --> 57:46.900
Oh, Dad.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.000
There are no stop signs up there.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
There is no defining space.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.800
We have always defined our space.

58:57.900 --> 59:00.800
A wall here, a room there.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.400
A hallway, a road.

59:07.200 --> 59:11.800
We have this way of dividing our space
until it equals a direction.

59:14.900 --> 59:17.800
We even created a space for the dead.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.200
Space is a difficult thing to grasp.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.400
Man, Farmer...

59:29.700 --> 59:32.200
...you have the most abstract thoughts.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.500
They don't make any sense at all.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.400
I'm just waiting for the other thoughts
to string all this mess together.

59:42.300 --> 59:43.800
Hey, who's that out there?

59:47.300 --> 59:50.100
Maybe one of Hal's long-lost friends.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.400
How you doing?

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.400
How many head of cattle
do you run out here?

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.300
Enough to suit me.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.100
You are the property owner?

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.700
Yeah.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.800
- Charles Farmer.
- Correct.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.500
I'm appraising your land
for First National Bank...

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.000
...who's actively seeking a foreclosure.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.500
What was your name?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.900
Sir?

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.100
- What was your name again?
- Robert Wilson.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.100
Robert, nice to meet you.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.500
You know, I own 352 acres.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.800
Did you ever try to find a body
on that much land?

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.100
I'm not the bad guy here, mister.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.600
Well, you're not the good guy either.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.900
Shep, look here. I think I've figured out
another way to make our fuel.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.700
We combine kerosene with hydrazine.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.900
Are you sure, Dad?

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.700
Son, I don't know another way to do it
unless we completely modify the engine.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.200
Plus, we got all the stuff
right here in the barn.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.500
The fuel will still be pumped in
at a high pressure...

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.300
...and it'll burn in the chamber...

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.400
...create the same exhaust gases
as the high-grade rocket fuel.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.100
That should provide enough thrust
to send me into orbit.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.800
Make sense?

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.500
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.400
Farmer?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.400
- Yeah, I'm down here in the engine room.
- Hey.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.200
- They made a ruling yet?
- Why do you think I'm here?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.800
The committee wants 60 days
to make a ruling.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.000
But I don't have 60 days.
The bank's gonna foreclose in a week.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I'm aware of that.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.400
- I just don't have that kind of time.
- That's their plan.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.500
Do you think they want you
to launch this?

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.100
They'll stall, stall, stall.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.200
And then there'll be appeals.
This'll go on forever.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.200
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.200
I'm sorry about the ruling, Farmer.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.500
Yeah.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.300
You know, my father loved ranching.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400
He loved it with all his heart.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.900
It was his dream.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.700
Then when it got tough...

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.700
...and he knew they were gonna
try to take it away from him...

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.200
...he put a gun to his head...

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.900
...before they could.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.800
And that bullet's still traveling.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.900
It just keeps on going.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.500
And now it's headed
straight for my dream.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.000
Just promise me
you're not gonna do something stupid.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.300
- Like what? Build a rocket?
- No.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.100
You know better than that.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.100
I've walked away before...

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.700
...and I can't walk away again.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.100
Charles?

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.300
I can't just keep failing.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.300
I hope you understand that.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.700
I promise you everything will be okay.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.700
No.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.000
Shepard!

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
Come on.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.000
Damn!

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.000
Charlie.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.900
Charlie, can you hear me?

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.400
No, don't move. Don't move your body.
Don't move it, sweetie.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.500
Oh, my God.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.500
Don't you dare leave this family.
You stay with me!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.900
Six broken ribs. Broken left wrist.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.000
Compound fracture to the fibula.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.500
Severe head trauma.
Multiple lacerations to the face.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.900
Is there any good news?

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.200
He's alive.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.900
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.900
You gotta be strong
for your daddy, now, okay?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.500
Now, he wants to hear how much
we love him, okay? It's really important.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.800
You okay?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.200
Yeah? How about you?
You all right, sweetheart?

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500
Stanley?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.900
Come here, sweetheart.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.800
Why don't we go get
something to drink.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.300
Will you stay with him, honey?

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.500
Stanley? Stanley. Honey.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.000
Dad?

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:23.300
It's Shep, Dad.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.200
I was looking in the barn today...

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:37.200
...and we can build another one
just like it. I swear we can.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.399
We have everything
right in there in the barn.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.800
We could build everything.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.200
I swear, we can build another one
just like it. We just need you back.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.000
You can't give up. You can't give up.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.100
And, children, when they say,
"Don't try this at home," they mean it.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. What? Okay.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.899
Ask them how long they want us
to stay here. Ask them.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:28.500
Okay. Yeah. All right.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.700
They told us to hang tight.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.100
Grab a couple of these mugs.
They make good souvenirs.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.000
There's no logo on them.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.300
The blending of high-test rocket fuel
is clearly not a project for amateurs.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.600
This is why we have such strict rules
and regulations in place.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.899
Space flight is a serious endeavor,
not to be taken lightly.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:57.000
We can only hope
that through this near-fatal tragedy...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.400
...other space enthusiasts
get the real message...

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.100
...displayed by Mr. Farmer here,
and not the one hyped up by the media.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.800
No further questions.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.000
How stupid I am.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.600
This a lecture
that you want me to hear?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.000
No.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.800
You're alive, stupid.

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.300
They gotta get me some cereal.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.800
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing--

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.900
Oh, sweetie, let's not
play that game tonight, okay?

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.400
But why?

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.200
Because she said so.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.600
Please, honey.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.600
It's okay.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.300
Shepard, you gotta give him some time.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:46.000
Daddy's real tired, you know?
He needs to-- He needs to get some rest.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.800
Albeit handwritten, your dad's will
is pretty straightforward.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.700
Three trust funds for the kids.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.300
After that, 200,000 in assets.
Another 100,000 in cash.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.400
Some stocks and bonds.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.900
It's all yours.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.500
Troubles with the bank are over, anyway.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.100
Thank you.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.300
- Look, I found one!
- Look, I found one!

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.700
That's good, baby.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.500
- Look, I found one again!
- Look, I found one again!

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.100
Have them come get that rocket
and take it to the junkyard.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.900
- Charles.
- Audie, it's already hurt them enough.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.100
I don't want it
to hurt this family anymore.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:01.600
Well, everything is now current
and up-to-date.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.200
I have stopped the foreclosure.
No worries.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.600
Thanks, Arnie.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
You did the right thing.

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.300
Oh, boy.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.900
Did Farmer have us all believing
he was going off into outer space.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.700
How stupid do we look?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.700
What?

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.100
When we took our vows...

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.300
...we promised to love each other
in sickness and in health.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:53.800
Did that mean mental health?
Because you are crazy.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.400
I mean, when you first said you wanted
to go into space, I thought:

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.200
"Well, what man doesn't say
he wants his space?"

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.400
The difference is, now...

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.100
...we have a family.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.500
A beautiful family.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.700
And I see how the girls look at you.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.200
They adore you.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.600
They love their daddy
who wants to go into space.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.500
I don't wanna be responsible
for killing that hope in their eyes.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.200
And what kind of message
would you be sending to Shepard?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.500
I want his dad to show him
how it's done.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.900
Now, look.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.200
There's enough money in there
for you to do whatever you need to do.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.800
Without the rocket...

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.600
...we're just a dysfunctional family.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.100
We'll rebuild the rocket
to the exact specifications as the original.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:47.300
I've inventoried all materials on hand.
Awaiting delivery on...

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.500
Three spherical oxygen bottles.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.000
- Three thousand linear feet of 20-gauge...
- Unlike the first launch...

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.700
...this fuel will burn evenly...

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.600
...giving us the right amount of thrust
needed to launch...

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:03.000
- Twenty MCM submodule components.
- Lithium hydroxide canisters...

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:09.300
- There are plenty of alternative fuels.
- We have to find them legitimately.

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:14.700
The altitude would be 100 miles
and the speed would be 25,000...

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.400
Fire-protective fabric.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.100
- Test.
- Testing.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.300
The rocket will be launched from the barn,
heading 72.51 degrees...

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.800
Five thousand linear feet 30-gauge...

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700
Two hundred linear feet...

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.300
Oxygen could last
three times longer than needed...

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.600
...but let's not put that to the test.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.300
You know, when you're a kid,
you wanna be just like your dad.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.900
Then when you're a teenager...

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.600
...you don't wanna have
anything to do with him.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.400
Then when you grow up,
you end up just like him.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.900
My dad showed me one thing
when he died.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.300
He wasn't dying, he was giving up.

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:43.300
No matter what happens to me today,
my children will see that I didn't give up.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.100
And I can die knowing that.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Yeah.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.400
Man.

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.400
We have been out here way too long.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.900
Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.800
- What?
- Headquarters. Rocket Man's buying fuel.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.500
Suspect Charles Farmer. Male Caucasian.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.300
Approximately 5'10", 170 pounds.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:37.300
Last seen in a brown Ford pickup
bearing east on Route 9.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.700
Now, this launch is gonna take
all the strength...

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.700
...and all the focus this family has.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.400
You're my crew, my teammates.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.800
Well, thank you, honey.
I can use these, you know.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:14.800
- Is Daddy gonna come back?
- Yeah, I'm coming back.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.900
Don't you worry.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.300
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.300
It'll be okay. Don't you worry.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.300
I love you guys.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.500
Now, Shepard.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.400
If anything's gonna go wrong,
it'll go wrong in the first 10 minutes.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.700
- After that, I'll be airborne.
- Dad--

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.700
It's okay. I'm not worried about you.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.800
- You can do it.
- All right.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.700
Audie...

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.300
...it's gonna be okay.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.500
Please don't break my heart.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.000
I won't.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.400
Step away from the vehicle!
Show me your hands!

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.300
Put your hands up! Let me see them!

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:39.300
- Right there, right there.
- Let me see those hands.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.400
Turn around slowly.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.200
I expect you home for dinner.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.900
Dad, do you copy?

01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:59.900
Now we look like asses.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:02.700
Control Booth.

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.100
Preparation for launch underway.
Local temperature, 65 degrees.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.300
Wind speed, four knots.
Opening canopy doors.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.800
Cabin pressure holding 5.8.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.400
Fuel and oxygen are steady.
Power still looks good.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.200
Status is good.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.200
Canopy doors cleared for launch.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.300
All remaining units
report to the Farmer residence.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.400
- Ready for system check.
- Roger.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.400
Hydraulics okay. Fuel pressure's okay.
All systems go.

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.900
- Roger.
- Vessel restraints unlocked.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.400
Ignition system on.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.900
Abort system on standby.
Cleared for launch at zero hour, 9 a.m.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.400
Roger.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.100
Ten...

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.200
...nine...

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.100
...eight...

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.700
...seven, six...

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.100
...five, four...

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
...three...

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.000
...two, one.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.800
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.400
Fuel is go.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.100
- Go, Dad, go!
- Go, Dad!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.900
That is so huge.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.400
Charlie Farmer.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.200
Oxygen in the cabin is good.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.600
Pressure's holding.
The isolated battery's okay.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.600
Everything's okay. Son of a bitch.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.200
It's getting a little smoother.
A little smoother.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.100
Cut off, tower. Jettison green. Disarm.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.500
Charles Farmer launched!

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.100
No, he didn't.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:48.400
Capsule separation, green, okay.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.900
We did it, Shepard!

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.700
We did it!

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.000
We made it, Mom.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.900
This is where the dreams live.

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.100
I'm up here.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.400
Africa.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.200
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.900
God, I wish you were with me.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.400
I wish you guys were here so bad.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.500
Have you heard about this guy,
Charlie Farmer, who built his own rocket?

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.900
Shepard.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.600
Shepard, can you hear me?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.900
Shepard.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400
- Shepard?
- Dad.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.800
Shepard.

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.000
Shepard, can you hear me?

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.100
Come on.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.400
- Where is he?
- Dad, please come in.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.500
- Dad, are you there? Dad?
- It's okay.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.000
Control Booth to Dreamer.
Control Booth to Dreamer. Are you there?

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.500
It's okay.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.800
As you no doubt have heard,
there have been unsubstantiated rumors...

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.400
...of an alleged launch
from somewhere in Texas.

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.000
And for whatever reason, this seems to be
attributed to our old friend Mr. Farmer.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.600
We here at the FAA categorically deny
the existence of any launch.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.800
As far as we know,
Mr. Farmer is resting comfortably...

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.600
...probably watching
this press conference on television.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.500
Once again, no launch has taken place.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.100
Your daddy's gonna come home soon.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.600
So Dad launched at 0922.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.900
So right now he's been in orbit
for eight hours, 56 minutes and 15 seconds.

01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:30.700
Distance traveled so far
is 152,042 miles.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.700
Well, when will he come back?

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.600
He may do 12 or 13 orbits
before he re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.600
And if you figure that, then it...

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.600
What?

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.300
Well, he could end up
running out of oxygen.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.200
I still can't locate him, Mom.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.100
Why don't you get some rest?

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.000
- I can't, Mom. Dad needs me.
- That's an order.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.900
I'm proud of you.

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.000
Say something, Farmer.

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.800
Shepard.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.800
Come in, Shepard.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.000
Shepard.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.800
Shepard! Can you hear me?

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.900
Shepard!

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.500
Come on.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.500
Come on.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.900
Hello? Hello?

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.000
This is the Astronaut Farmer.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.800
- Come in, Mission Control.
- Dad, it's Shep!

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.800
Daddy! Daddy!

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.200
I think I'm gonna miss the back yard.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.200
Don't worry. I'm setting up coordinates
for orbit nine to 10.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.100
You don't wanna miss
this window for re-entry.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.500
If readings are correct,
you're off by 20 percent.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:05.500
- Preparing for re-entry.
- Re-entry is go.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.400
Good luck.
We'll be watching for you, Dad.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200
Where can we take you?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.500
Home.

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.100
- Hey, Dad.
- I made it! I made it!

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.600
Good job, son.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.900
- I love you.
- My helmet.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.600
I want that.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.600
- And I want the rocket.
- I want that.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
Let's go to a restaurant to have pizza.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.300
Okay. We could go there too.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.300
My next guest has an amazing story.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:42.300
He's the only private citizen
ever to build his own rocket...

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.900
...orbit the Earth, and return safely.

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.100
As you know, he orbited nine times.

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.700
Please welcome Charlie Farmer.
Charlie, come on out here.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.900
How are you, pal? Good to see you.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.500
Have a seat.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.900
Let me ask you something.

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.100
How does this go over
with the wife and kids?

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.700
Most guys I know can't
get a Harley out of the wife.

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:12.900
You know what I'm saying?
How do you get the rocket?

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.700
I know it might sound like baloney...

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:19.700
...but my wife and kids were real supportive
of the whole thing all the way around.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.400
How do you know you were
physically up to this? It's been a while--

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.900
I did some tests on myself.

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.700
I know they have that big--
What is that? The cyclotron?

01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:31.700
What do you do, run around a tree
with a rope? What do you do?

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.200
See what I'm saying?

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.700
I didn't really have the equipment
that NASA might require.

01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.900
So I just had to make up
my own tests, but...

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.900
You think they will clamp down on people?
Will people be allowed to do this after you?

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:48.900
You know, I was fine
when I was building the rocket.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.700
It's when I ordered the 10,000 pounds
of rocket fuel...

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.500
- ...that the FBI--
- Well, yeah, that'd do it.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.900
- The FBI came around to say hello to me.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:02.300
I know all the government people,
the NASA people, were against you.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.500
Once this looked like
it was gonna happen...

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.000
...were they pulling for you
or feeling resistance?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.600
Well, I'll put it this way.

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.600
To be up there
and look back down here at us...

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.200
- ...it makes it all worth it.
- Well, you did it.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.000
Godspeed to you, Charlie. Great job.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.100
Charlie Farmer will be right back,
right after this.
