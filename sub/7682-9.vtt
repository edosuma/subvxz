00:56.956 --> 00:59.291
Now that I have your attention,

00:59.291 --> 01:03.087
let it be known that
the annual Fizzics Follies

01:03.087 --> 01:08.384
has been fractioned
to the final four finalists.

01:08.717 --> 01:11.762
The great, just ask him,
Geoffrey Kramer.

01:11.762 --> 01:14.389
Yay, Geoffrey!

01:16.391 --> 01:21.396
The beautiful, in both brain and body,
Hillary Chapman.

01:21.396 --> 01:24.691
All right, Hillary! You get my vote.

01:25.609 --> 01:29.112
The prodigal son of
the great one himself, David Ryman.

01:29.112 --> 01:31.823
- All right, David.
- You can do it.

01:31.823 --> 01:34.910
And last, but certainly not least,

01:34.952 --> 01:37.913
this year's cinch winner
with the best barricade

01:37.913 --> 01:40.374
since the Great Wall of China,

01:40.374 --> 01:43.001
me.

01:55.722 --> 01:57.307
Good luck, everybody.

01:57.307 --> 01:59.184
- See you later.
- MacGyver!

01:59.184 --> 02:01.561
- Bye.
- Hey, MacGyver!

02:01.561 --> 02:05.106
Dad told me you were
coming to judge the Barricade Contest.

02:05.106 --> 02:07.776
It's tough to refuse
a request from your dad.

02:07.776 --> 02:10.820
- How you doing, David?
- Oh, pretty good.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.739
You sure haven't changed much.

02:12.739 --> 02:15.408
That's the same jacket
you had ten years ago.

02:15.408 --> 02:17.661
Yeah, I'm kind of attached to it.

02:17.661 --> 02:20.497
Congratulations,
I hear you're a finalist.

02:20.497 --> 02:24.042
Following Ryman family tradition
right down the line.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.919
Now all I got to do is win.

02:25.919 --> 02:29.297
Don't worry, with you here
as referee, the fix is in.

02:29.297 --> 02:30.632
Sure it is.

02:30.632 --> 02:34.010
I gotta pick something up.
You checking in with the great one?

02:34.010 --> 02:37.388
- Yup.
- Okay, I'll catch you there.

03:13.883 --> 03:19.555
The Fizzics Follies had been a tradition
at Western Tech for almost 30 years.

03:19.555 --> 03:24.310
The first winner of the Barricade
Contest was my mentor, Julian Ryman,

03:24.310 --> 03:28.147
who barricaded the lab in the
physics building his senior year.

03:28.147 --> 03:31.609
Ryman went on to become
a professor and a Nobel Prize winner.

03:31.609 --> 03:34.278
Not all of us were so brilliant.

03:34.278 --> 03:36.697
Welcome back, MacGyver.

03:36.697 --> 03:40.910
- Reflecting on past glories?
- Does bring back some memories.

03:40.910 --> 03:43.370
- How you doing, professor?
- Oh, fine.

03:43.370 --> 03:45.748
I continue to be a little disappointed

03:45.748 --> 03:49.627
when those who show
a shred of promise flee the fold.

03:49.627 --> 03:53.464
There you are, MacGyver,
in the Physics Hall of Fame.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.716
But where are you, MacGyver?

03:55.716 --> 03:58.219
- Happy. Doing what I'm doing.
- Nonsense.

03:58.219 --> 04:01.847
- You should've stayed with physics.
- I expanded my horizons.

04:01.847 --> 04:04.475
Went in other directions.

04:04.558 --> 04:09.271
Looking forward to seeing your
son's picture up there along with yours?

04:09.271 --> 04:12.232
I saw David outside, how's he doing?

04:12.232 --> 04:15.527
B's, he's getting B's. A few A's.

04:15.569 --> 04:19.447
That's not what I mean.
How is he doing?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.827
Fine.

04:25.954 --> 04:28.499
Come and see the
next generation in action.

04:28.499 --> 04:31.710
You can be depressed along with me.

04:57.778 --> 05:02.073
Twenty-three point seven below.
Perfect.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.700
Hi.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.994
When I heard the rumour about some nerd

05:05.994 --> 05:08.413
breaking into the
ROTC storage compound

05:08.413 --> 05:11.958
and making off with their cannon,
I wondered, where's David?

05:11.958 --> 05:13.501
Vicious lies.

05:13.501 --> 05:15.545
I didn't forget. Happy birthday.

05:15.545 --> 05:18.131
Thanks. It was yesterday.

05:19.049 --> 05:23.678
- I'm sorry.
- You seem to say that a lot lately.

05:24.095 --> 05:26.389
Well, I've had a lot on my mind lately.

05:26.389 --> 05:28.516
Like the Barricade Contest?

05:28.516 --> 05:31.102
You didn't sleep again last night,
did you?

05:31.102 --> 05:34.564
You look awful.
You're gonna kill yourself.

05:34.564 --> 05:38.693
- Well, the thought crossed my mind.
- Quit talking like that.

05:38.693 --> 05:41.654
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.952
I've got 84... Here he comes.

05:47.952 --> 05:50.580
- You did?
- Yeah.

05:51.414 --> 05:55.168
- Good afternoon, Professor Ryman.
- Afternoon.

05:55.168 --> 05:59.172
Class, I would like to
introduce to you Mr MacGyver,

05:59.172 --> 06:01.382
who will be observing today.

06:01.382 --> 06:03.634
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:03.634 --> 06:06.345
Mr MacGyver is a former student here,

06:06.345 --> 06:08.848
though, of course, not in your league.

06:08.848 --> 06:11.434
He was gifted.

06:11.559 --> 06:14.520
Mr MacGyver is also the alumni referee

06:14.520 --> 06:17.315
for the culmination
of the Barricade Contest,

06:17.315 --> 06:21.777
so I know you're going to treat him
with deference and respect.

06:21.777 --> 06:24.530
Ready your experiments,
I'll check them over.

06:24.530 --> 06:28.576
You may not be able to tell
from some of the constructions,

06:28.576 --> 06:32.705
but the prodigies are all focusing
on low-temperature physics.

06:32.705 --> 06:35.291
Superconductors,

06:35.374 --> 06:38.294
because that's where
all the big bucks are today,

06:38.294 --> 06:41.797
isn't that right, my little geniuses?

06:45.634 --> 06:47.720
- Using argon?
- Yes, sir.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.889
How thin is your film?

06:49.889 --> 06:52.558
I got it down to four atomic layers.

06:52.558 --> 06:55.561
That's impressive, Mr Kramer.
Very impressive.

06:55.561 --> 06:57.897
Thank you, sir.

06:57.897 --> 07:02.151
Look at this,
these results don't make any sense.

07:02.151 --> 07:05.738
Well, maybe you've got a leak
in the plumbing here somewhere.

07:05.738 --> 07:08.782
You're right,
but I had it plugged yesterday.

07:08.782 --> 07:11.660
Run the mass spectrometer again.

07:31.555 --> 07:34.766
- Well, there it is.
- Have you tried silicone, Apiezon?

07:34.766 --> 07:37.895
Silicone didn't work,
stockroom's out of Apiezon.

07:37.895 --> 07:42.149
You need something to stick in the
fracture that'll expand as it freezes.

07:42.149 --> 07:45.569
- Like what?
- Think... for a change.

07:47.529 --> 07:50.073
Yeah, well, I need
the materials, don't I?

07:50.073 --> 07:53.660
- Improvise, David.
- With what?

07:55.662 --> 07:58.957
MacGyver could fix it, couldn't you?

08:07.716 --> 08:09.843
- Spit.
- Sir?

08:09.843 --> 08:12.470
Spit, spit, spit!

08:37.953 --> 08:43.042
Nothing worse than a physicist
stupefied by the obvious.

08:52.427 --> 08:56.180
- Don't let him get to you.
- No sweat.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.939
Wasn't that a little rough?

09:05.523 --> 09:08.401
Physics is about truth, not tact.

09:08.401 --> 09:11.779
- I was rough on you too.
- Yes, you were. You were a tyrant.

09:11.779 --> 09:15.450
But you humiliated David. He's your son!

09:16.284 --> 09:20.705
Nobody's going
to give him any points for that.

09:22.915 --> 09:24.792
Oh, I should have seen it!

09:24.792 --> 09:28.713
I worked hours to plug that leak,
my father does it in three seconds.

09:28.713 --> 09:30.840
He's done physics his whole life.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.551
- Yeah, and a Nobel Prize.
- But you've got me.

09:33.551 --> 09:36.345
He'll notice when I win
the Barricade Contest.

09:36.345 --> 09:39.724
- That contest is not the whole world.
- Oh, I'm gonna win.

09:39.724 --> 09:45.146
And I'm gonna get my picture
up on that wall next to his.

09:45.313 --> 09:48.482
You want to see it?
You want to see my barricade?

09:48.482 --> 09:49.900
You're kidding.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.237
You're going to share
the best kept secret on this campus?

09:53.237 --> 09:55.448
I'm honoured. I'm flattered, I'm...

09:55.448 --> 09:59.827
- Hey, this is a limited-time offer.
- Lead on.

10:06.542 --> 10:11.547
I've been waiting months
to see your barricade, David.

10:20.139 --> 10:22.891
Bizarre, David. Really bizarre.

10:23.058 --> 10:28.230
- Are you hiding a woman back there?
- Don't look back there!

10:28.230 --> 10:30.482
David, I've never seen you so jumpy.

10:30.482 --> 10:33.444
If you don't want to show it to me,
I can wait.

10:33.444 --> 10:36.905
No, it's just I want you to try
and figure it out first, okay?

10:36.905 --> 10:39.533
I'm sorry.

10:43.579 --> 10:46.206
Just wait till you see this.

10:58.635 --> 11:03.932
- A garage door opener.
- Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.

11:06.768 --> 11:12.149
A miniature! That's incredible!
No wonder it's been taking so long.

11:12.149 --> 11:15.026
The true genius
is the way the miniature works.

11:15.026 --> 11:19.364
- You mean it actually opens and closes?
- Yeah. Just like the real thing.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.616
Okay, step one.

11:21.616 --> 11:24.160
You're here to bust my barricade.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.622
- What's the first thing you do?
- Look through the peephole.

11:27.622 --> 11:30.875
- What do you see?
- I see a room and a garage door opener.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.503
Right. But now...

11:35.213 --> 11:38.675
A periscope over the peephole.

11:38.842 --> 11:43.722
The plot thickens.
Now what are you doing?

11:43.888 --> 11:46.474
I'm lining up the model
with the periscope.

11:46.474 --> 11:50.019
If you look through the peephole,
what do you see?

11:50.019 --> 11:51.855
I see the same thing.

11:51.855 --> 11:55.316
I see what looks like the room,
but it's the miniature.

11:55.316 --> 11:57.193
- Door locked?
- Door locked.

11:57.193 --> 12:01.573
Okay. What does a brilliant
barricade buster do next?

12:01.573 --> 12:06.035
I dig up a scanner to locate
the frequency your remote operates on.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.079
Excellent, excellent.

12:08.079 --> 12:11.749
- Now, assuming you find it.
- Push the button.

12:11.749 --> 12:13.876
- And the miniature opens.
- Right.

12:13.876 --> 12:17.422
And at the same time that's happening,
the big motor turns

12:17.422 --> 12:20.216
and the real one closes. Look.

12:20.633 --> 12:24.303
The door is open the whole time
they're trying to figure it out?

12:24.303 --> 12:28.099
When they solve the problem,
the solution creates the barricade.

12:28.099 --> 12:32.186
- Well, what do you think?
- It's brilliant!

12:36.983 --> 12:38.609
Worthy of the Ryman name?

12:38.609 --> 12:41.779
More than worthy. You're wonderful.

12:43.614 --> 12:47.827
Oh, I can't wait to see the look on my
father's face when I win tomorrow.

12:47.827 --> 12:50.413
Neither can I.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.541
David!

12:53.541 --> 12:56.919
You promised you were off this stuff.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.297
Yeah, I know, when I finish this thing.

13:00.297 --> 13:02.341
No, David, you promised.

13:02.341 --> 13:06.679
- Why don't you just lay off?
- Give them to me.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.639
Get out of here. Leave me alone.

13:08.639 --> 13:11.851
I'm not gonna let you
kill yourself over some contest.

13:11.851 --> 13:14.436
Janet!

13:16.814 --> 13:19.650
Janet! Janet, wait a minute!

13:39.002 --> 13:41.046
All right, ya'll know the rules.

13:41.046 --> 13:44.925
As each door is opened,
the occupant of that room is eliminated.

13:44.925 --> 13:49.096
But please, use your wits,
no heavy machinery.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.516
The builder of the last
remaining barricade is the winner.

13:52.516 --> 13:54.518
Oh, and do remember:

13:54.518 --> 13:58.355
Einstein never won a barricade contest.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.400
Good luck, Geoffrey.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.153
Janet, I tried calling you last night,
but you weren't home.

14:05.153 --> 14:09.366
Yes, I was.
I just didn't know what to say.

14:09.533 --> 14:12.119
But I'm really sorry.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.746
David?

14:14.996 --> 14:18.500
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

14:20.710 --> 14:24.631
Go win your contest.
I'll talk to you later.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.259
Yeah.

14:40.522 --> 14:44.317
- What's the matter? You seem worried.
- You saw him. He's a wreck.

14:44.317 --> 14:48.113
The others started working
on their barricade a week or two ago.

14:48.113 --> 14:50.615
David's devoted
his life to it for months.

14:50.615 --> 14:52.325
- Why?
- To win.

14:52.325 --> 14:56.579
To show his father
he's cut of the Ryman cloth.

14:56.579 --> 14:59.582
- What does the professor think?
- Are you kidding?

14:59.582 --> 15:01.334
He can't see past his own ego.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.671
He has no idea
what he's doing to his own son.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.674
It's no wonder David's taking...

15:09.926 --> 15:12.679
- Taking what?
- Nothing.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.722
Janet...

15:14.722 --> 15:17.308
...is David taking drugs?

15:17.392 --> 15:20.645
It's all the time now.
He's moody, he doesn't eat.

15:20.645 --> 15:22.230
He never sleeps.

15:22.230 --> 15:25.691
He jokes about killing himself.
I can't tell if he's serious.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.444
If you care about him,
you got to deal with it.

15:28.444 --> 15:31.489
It's not just gonna go away.
I've got to talk to him.

15:31.489 --> 15:34.867
No! No, please.
You can't lay this on him now.

15:34.867 --> 15:41.916
Wait a couple of hours until after the
contest, and we'll talk to him. Okay?

15:45.127 --> 15:47.755
All right.

15:49.799 --> 15:53.594
Okay. Geoffrey Kramer starts out
with Aaron Turner's door.

15:53.594 --> 15:56.389
- Aaron, wanna set up the problem?
- I'd love to.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.642
We have 1 2 dead-bolt locks.

15:59.809 --> 16:02.686
Some of the keys you turn this way,

16:02.686 --> 16:05.272
and it locks or unlocks.

16:05.439 --> 16:08.692
Some of the keys you turn this way,

16:08.692 --> 16:11.737
and it locks or unlocks.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.866
All Geoffrey has to do is get
all 1 2 unlocked at the same time.

16:15.866 --> 16:18.786
Try to be a good loser, Geoffy.

16:22.831 --> 16:25.584
Simply, the barricade
presents a possibility

16:25.584 --> 16:29.463
of 4,096 different key combinations.

16:30.714 --> 16:33.258
At least you've got
that much figured out.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.136
Difficult. But not impossible.

16:36.303 --> 16:39.848
All right, next.
David, you get Hillary's door.

16:39.848 --> 16:42.851
Okay. Unlike Aaron,

16:43.018 --> 16:46.063
my barricade works from inside the room.

16:46.063 --> 16:47.815
Have a look, David.

16:47.815 --> 16:52.194
What David sees is a
balance scale holding two vessels.

16:52.194 --> 16:55.113
One filled with a fine French Chablis,

16:55.113 --> 16:57.491
the other with ordinary tap water.

16:57.491 --> 16:59.826
The object is to tip the scale

16:59.826 --> 17:05.832
in either direction, completing the
electrical circuit to unlock the door.

17:05.832 --> 17:08.377
Thank you.

17:08.377 --> 17:11.296
David. Your turn.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.800
Well, mine is a mechanical barricade.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.303
Now, empirical observation,
an analytical mind

17:18.303 --> 17:20.847
and some common sense
should get it open.

17:20.847 --> 17:22.390
How long it'll take?

17:22.390 --> 17:25.101
Well, that's another question.

17:29.689 --> 17:32.859
Oh, it looks like a garage door opener.

17:32.859 --> 17:37.239
Interesting. I'm looking forward
to solving this one myself, Hillary.

17:37.239 --> 17:39.866
But do your best anyway.

17:40.367 --> 17:42.202
Mr Kramer, your turn.

17:42.202 --> 17:46.289
Mr MacGyver. Professor Ryman.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.584
Fellow competitors. Observe.

17:49.751 --> 17:50.960
A time lock,

17:50.960 --> 17:55.131
ticking down to the grand opening
of this room tomorrow morning at 9am.

17:55.131 --> 17:59.552
Hey, the rules say there's got to be
a way in besides using a sledge hammer.

17:59.552 --> 18:01.262
Oh, there is.

18:01.262 --> 18:05.225
One just has
to be bright enough to find it.

18:05.225 --> 18:09.479
All right, you all have the setup.
Four doors, four finalists.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.814
You have your assignments, so...

18:11.814 --> 18:14.400
So let the games begin.

18:19.572 --> 18:22.825
Professor, you know David's
been knocking himself out

18:22.825 --> 18:25.244
to make his barricade
as famous as yours.

18:25.244 --> 18:28.331
Really? Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

18:28.331 --> 18:31.584
It's put a lot of pressure on him.

18:32.043 --> 18:36.839
Pressure, MacGyver,
is what turns coal into diamonds.

18:56.192 --> 19:00.029
All I have to do is find the right
frequency, and you have a winner.

19:00.029 --> 19:03.616
Well, give it a shot, Hillary. Come on.

19:07.912 --> 19:10.915
- Will you plug that in?
- Sure.

19:15.252 --> 19:18.756
I'm afraid young Aaron
is on the wrong track.

19:18.756 --> 19:25.763
From the looks of the equipment they
brought in, I'd say we have a contest.

19:29.183 --> 19:33.520
Trying to run all
4,096 different combinations

19:33.687 --> 19:36.815
at an average of ten seconds per try

19:36.815 --> 19:40.069
would take me more than 1 2 hours.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.573
So using these iron filings
and a magnet,

19:44.573 --> 19:47.576
I'm going to magnetise each lock

19:47.743 --> 19:54.374
and provide a visual reference as
to whether the bolt is open or closed.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.462
This one's closed, as you can see.

19:59.421 --> 20:01.757
- Now it's open.
- Very clever.

20:01.757 --> 20:05.469
Everything between the two poles
of this magnet is magnetised.

20:05.469 --> 20:08.972
Wherever a lock bolt is closed,
the iron filings will stick.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.850
- Two more locked.
- Nice work.

20:11.892 --> 20:15.145
- Now they're open.
- Excellent analysis, Mr Kramer.

20:15.145 --> 20:18.482
Thank you, sir.
I take pride in my creativity.

20:18.482 --> 20:21.109
- Really.
- Modest.

20:24.279 --> 20:29.034
- I think he's got it.
- Give me a hand over here.

20:30.327 --> 20:36.124
- Come on, you can do it.
- Geoffrey's moving along pretty fast...

20:36.124 --> 20:39.002
- Hey, check out David.
- Yeah.

20:44.466 --> 20:48.595
- Great, frequency generator.
- Is that right?

20:53.725 --> 20:56.311
My ears.

21:10.992 --> 21:13.578
Hey, I did it!

21:15.455 --> 21:16.998
All right.

21:16.998 --> 21:19.584
As did I.

21:25.381 --> 21:28.843
Hillary, looks like we finally
have something in common.

21:28.843 --> 21:32.847
- All right, we have our finalists.
- And may the better physicist win.

21:32.847 --> 21:36.100
And we know who that is, don't we?

21:39.896 --> 21:42.482
- How's Geoffrey doing?
- Not even close.

21:42.482 --> 21:45.109
Good.

21:46.569 --> 21:50.698
Hey, everyone,
I built a frequency converter.

21:57.830 --> 22:01.250
He hypes the electric frequency
and the clock goes faster.

22:01.250 --> 22:05.129
- I do believe he's going to win.
- Don't be so sure.

22:05.129 --> 22:07.381
I think I got it.

22:07.381 --> 22:09.967
I found the frequency.

22:31.363 --> 22:33.991
That's great. Not yet.

22:39.830 --> 22:41.832
Very clever, David.

22:41.832 --> 22:47.254
The garage door opener
has nothing to do with it, does it?

22:52.843 --> 22:54.720
Come on, come on, come on.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.638
All right, it's working!

22:56.638 --> 22:58.056
All right, David.

22:58.056 --> 23:00.058
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win!

23:00.058 --> 23:02.686
Come on, clock. Come on!

23:03.520 --> 23:06.106
5.1 5...

23:15.157 --> 23:19.244
Oh, 6.00. Come on, 6.1 5,

23:19.411 --> 23:21.538
6.30,

23:21.538 --> 23:24.583
6.45... 7.00!

23:26.334 --> 23:29.254
- Look at that, it's gonna work.
- David!

23:29.254 --> 23:31.381
- 7.30...
- I got it!

23:31.381 --> 23:32.883
What?

23:32.883 --> 23:37.721
It's all an illusion.
The door isn't locked at all!

23:43.059 --> 23:45.770
Let's congratulate the winner.

23:45.770 --> 23:49.149
Very well done, Mr Kramer. Well done.

23:56.573 --> 23:58.199
Ten more seconds...

23:58.199 --> 24:00.827
Congratulations, Geoffrey.

24:01.411 --> 24:03.997
Hey, I'm sorry.

24:05.874 --> 24:07.375
David!

24:07.375 --> 24:13.339
You came in second. You did great.
Come on. Get some perspective.

24:13.465 --> 24:19.596
You know, I used to get mad
at my father for not believing in me.

24:19.804 --> 24:22.265
But he's right.

24:22.265 --> 24:24.851
I am a loser.

24:26.811 --> 24:28.980
- Who's gonna buy me a drink?
- Not me!

24:28.980 --> 24:31.608
I will, Geoffrey.

24:33.985 --> 24:38.031
- Will I see you later at the party?
- Yes.

24:38.072 --> 24:42.076
You guys were all good.
All right, Hillary!

25:31.458 --> 25:34.086
Tony!

25:35.963 --> 25:38.340
Excuse me.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.884
Have you seen David?

25:39.884 --> 25:42.511
No, but I would
like to talk to you about him.

25:42.511 --> 25:46.724
I hope he's not staying away because
he lost. That's hardly the Ryman way.

25:46.724 --> 25:50.227
What's that? Staying away? Or losing?

25:51.729 --> 25:54.606
Sir, would you please join me?

25:56.066 --> 25:59.778
There's something going on
with David that you are not aware of.

25:59.778 --> 26:04.283
- Oh, what's that?
- Pressure. Possible burnout.

26:05.492 --> 26:09.538
Every student on this campus
is pushed to his limits, you know that.

26:09.538 --> 26:11.832
Maybe for David it's too much.

26:11.832 --> 26:13.667
Janet says he doesn't sleep.

26:13.667 --> 26:16.753
He overreacts to things,
like this contest.

26:16.753 --> 26:21.258
And professor,
he's taking speed to stay up for things.

26:21.258 --> 26:23.844
Speed?

26:23.844 --> 26:25.971
My son, drugs?

26:25.971 --> 26:27.973
Yes, sir.

26:27.973 --> 26:30.559
David needs help.

26:31.184 --> 26:33.812
No, I'm sorry, MacGyver.

26:33.854 --> 26:37.274
I don't believe that. Not any of it.

26:37.441 --> 26:39.609
No, sir, you don't, do you?

26:39.609 --> 26:42.446
You don't see any of it.

26:43.655 --> 26:47.701
But there's a difference.
Like Geoffrey here.

26:47.701 --> 26:50.537
He handles pressure
in a totally different way.

26:50.537 --> 26:53.373
I heard my name mentioned.

26:53.540 --> 26:55.834
Of course. It's my party.

26:55.834 --> 27:00.255
No, actually, I was just starting
to talk about how you won the contest.

27:00.255 --> 27:02.340
Right.

27:02.340 --> 27:05.385
Well, like I told you,
the door was never locked.

27:05.385 --> 27:08.847
Do you want to tell the professor
how you knew that?

27:08.847 --> 27:11.099
A little luck.

27:11.099 --> 27:13.685
A little ingenuity.

27:15.145 --> 27:17.772
I don't think so.

27:19.190 --> 27:21.276
I don't have to tell you anything.

27:21.276 --> 27:23.444
I think you do.

27:23.444 --> 27:28.324
Mr Kramer... we're talking
about physics here, not a game show.

27:28.324 --> 27:32.328
Now I think you will tell me,
specifically,

27:32.495 --> 27:37.083
what line of scientific inquiry
led you to your result?

27:37.083 --> 27:39.752
Hey! You all saw it.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.714
The door was open,
it was an optical illusion.

27:42.714 --> 27:45.800
- He used that periscope.
- That's right, he did.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.927
That's exactly what he did.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.972
But you had no way of knowing that.

27:50.972 --> 27:55.143
Geoffrey, you opened the door,
but you never looked inside.

27:55.143 --> 28:00.231
You never saw a periscope.
At least not this afternoon.

28:03.025 --> 28:07.029
David won the Barricade Contest,
didn't he?

28:07.071 --> 28:09.657
Mr Kramer?

28:25.256 --> 28:27.842
We'll go and find my son.

29:17.182 --> 29:20.602
I told you all that hard work
was going to pay off. He won.

29:20.602 --> 29:22.521
He couldn't do that on drugs.

29:22.521 --> 29:24.690
Professor, you're not hearing me.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.275
David needs help.

29:26.275 --> 29:29.361
He is a kid who's begging you to listen.

29:29.361 --> 29:30.779
Nonsense, MacGyver.

29:30.779 --> 29:33.073
Pressure turns coal into diamonds?

29:33.073 --> 29:36.702
- Well, that's a physical fact.
- It can also crush it to dust.

29:36.702 --> 29:38.495
- In this part...
- Thank God!

29:38.495 --> 29:41.873
I was just coming to get you. Hurry.

29:44.126 --> 29:45.502
David's on the phone.

29:45.502 --> 29:49.589
He's barricaded himself
in the physics lab. David?

29:49.589 --> 29:53.093
Your father and MacGyver
are here. They want to talk to you.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.679
Oh, no, no, no.

29:55.679 --> 29:58.265
What's happening, David?

29:59.057 --> 30:01.685
- David.
- Hey, Dad.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.397
We're gonna make history over this one.

30:05.397 --> 30:08.775
Ryman and son. Ryman and son.

30:08.942 --> 30:10.860
Ryman and son. Yeah!

30:10.860 --> 30:14.989
David, you won the Barricade Contest.

30:15.156 --> 30:17.826
Oh, Barricade Contest, hell!

30:17.992 --> 30:22.288
I built the barricade
to end all barricades.

30:23.581 --> 30:27.043
- David...
- The whole physics lab...

30:27.836 --> 30:30.463
I've got it wired.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.883
I even outdid you, Dad.

30:36.469 --> 30:39.055
I built a bomb.

30:41.474 --> 30:44.727
So how about it, Professor Ryman?

30:44.894 --> 30:47.021
Think we'll get famous over this?

30:47.021 --> 30:49.273
Oh, it's the ultimate, huh?

30:49.273 --> 30:52.193
David, what do you say
you lighten up a little bit?

30:52.193 --> 30:54.737
How about if I come over
and we talk about it?

30:54.737 --> 30:57.573
Oh, will you bring a six-pack?

30:58.950 --> 31:02.787
Oh, you know me.
Carrot juice is about as heavy as I get.

31:02.787 --> 31:03.996
What do you say?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.791
No go, MacGyver.

31:06.958 --> 31:09.669
This lab is for Rymans only.

31:10.670 --> 31:14.173
- Rymans only.
- I'll be there in five minutes.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.050
Please stop the foolishness.

31:16.050 --> 31:18.261
What does he mean, he's wired the lab?

31:18.261 --> 31:22.264
It's that whole thing with his father.
The great original barricade.

31:22.264 --> 31:24.183
It won't be easy to get in there.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.602
Do you think this
bomb thing is for real?

31:26.602 --> 31:28.104
Only one way to find out.

31:28.104 --> 31:33.192
Listen, I'm finally gonna make a big
mark on this campus, Professor Ryman.

31:33.192 --> 31:36.403
- All over the campus.
- David.

31:36.570 --> 31:39.198
David, not "professor."

31:39.281 --> 31:42.117
Please, David, I'm your father.

31:42.827 --> 31:44.745
Since when?

31:44.745 --> 31:48.791
I'm going over there. I want you
two to keep him talking. Keep him busy.

31:48.791 --> 31:52.002
- I'm going with you.
- So now he's got your attention?

31:52.002 --> 31:57.675
- What? Are you saying this is my fault?
- You're the one with the Nobel Prize.

31:57.675 --> 32:00.219
- You figure it out.
- Yeah, you tell him!

32:00.219 --> 32:01.845
All right, that's enough.

32:01.845 --> 32:05.933
We've got to calm him down,
I want you to keep him talking.

32:05.933 --> 32:09.937
Well, it's time for the lesser
of the Ryman clan to sign off.

32:09.937 --> 32:12.481
Or should I say, sign out?

32:12.481 --> 32:15.234
David? Can we talk about this?

32:15.359 --> 32:18.695
T alk, talk, talk.

32:18.862 --> 32:23.367
How come all of a sudden
everyone wants to talk?

32:29.915 --> 32:33.085
You know,
if he really has built a bomb,

32:33.085 --> 32:35.253
this whole campus is in danger.

32:35.253 --> 32:38.090
- Why? What do you mean?
- Plutonium.

32:38.090 --> 32:41.927
Nuclear physics
is in the lab above mine.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.097
David, it doesn't have to be like this.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.682
It's too late.

32:48.809 --> 32:51.436
No time.

32:56.983 --> 32:59.611
What's he done? David?

32:59.611 --> 33:02.197
David!

33:03.698 --> 33:06.368
Good evening, Professor Ryman.

33:12.248 --> 33:15.085
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I think so.

33:15.085 --> 33:18.546
See what happens
when you try and get too close?

33:18.546 --> 33:21.132
You get hurt.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.977
Janet, I got to go.

33:32.977 --> 33:36.814
If you hear a loud bang,
it was just me saying goodbye.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.274
David?

33:38.274 --> 33:41.486
David, wait. Talk to me!

33:41.653 --> 33:44.239
David, pick up the phone!

33:46.950 --> 33:53.122
Oh, he's wired a motion detector
to some high-voltage power source.

33:55.124 --> 33:57.752
If we get too close...

34:00.546 --> 34:05.218
-...we're toast.
- Ingenious. Damn it.

34:05.384 --> 34:09.347
We have to blindside
that detector somehow.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.766
Keep him busy.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.936
David.

34:14.936 --> 34:17.230
David, we have to talk.

34:17.230 --> 34:19.398
Oh, you want to talk?

34:19.398 --> 34:21.943
That's a joke. Talk about what?

34:21.943 --> 34:24.527
Anything you say.

34:28.114 --> 34:30.701
Okay.

34:32.411 --> 34:36.123
How about the swim meet
you never showed up at?

34:36.123 --> 34:40.335
What about the Christmas presents Mom
used to buy me and sign your name to?

34:40.335 --> 34:44.465
- I was busy.
- Oh, yeah, right. Busy.

35:03.484 --> 35:06.153
When's my birthday?

35:06.320 --> 35:10.908
- What do you mean?
- I mean, when's my birthday?

35:11.283 --> 35:13.911
It's in May.

35:14.995 --> 35:17.581
Your birthday's in May.

35:18.332 --> 35:21.543
When in May? Yours is March 1 1.

35:21.710 --> 35:24.338
When's my birthday?

35:25.464 --> 35:28.008
You don't know, do you?

35:28.008 --> 35:30.594
The 24th of May.

35:32.137 --> 35:34.890
June six.

35:36.975 --> 35:39.603
You lose.

35:47.486 --> 35:49.154
David, David...

35:49.154 --> 35:53.033
If that bomb is detonated,
it's going to injure

35:53.033 --> 35:55.077
more than just you and me.

35:55.077 --> 35:58.121
Knock, knock, who's there?
Ryman and son.

35:58.121 --> 36:00.749
Professor Ryman and Professor Son.

36:00.749 --> 36:05.629
David! There is plutonium
in the lab directly above this one.

36:05.629 --> 36:09.758
If you have a bomb, you could
contaminate the entire campus...

36:09.758 --> 36:12.385
The whole area!

36:13.637 --> 36:16.222
Plutonium?

36:17.807 --> 36:21.019
- You're lying.
- No, it's the truth.

36:21.019 --> 36:23.646
David, let us in.

36:25.648 --> 36:28.568
David, what about the other people?

36:28.568 --> 36:29.986
What about Janet?

36:29.986 --> 36:32.572
Janet...

36:34.866 --> 36:37.494
Janet...

36:41.039 --> 36:43.333
Hold it! I've got a way in.

36:43.333 --> 36:46.461
- What?
- Acetic acid and ammonia.

36:49.213 --> 36:50.465
Oh, very good.

36:50.465 --> 36:55.845
Mix the gases, make a smoke screen
and blind the detector.

37:00.892 --> 37:02.977
Go!

37:02.977 --> 37:05.605
David!

37:09.609 --> 37:15.907
- He's still got a strong pulse.
- Well, let's get him out of here.

37:22.330 --> 37:23.539
Oh, wow.

37:23.539 --> 37:27.251
You got an A on this lab project, David.

37:28.711 --> 37:31.088
- You still there?
- What's happening?

37:31.088 --> 37:35.635
Janet, I want you to call security.
Have them evacuate the entire campus.

37:35.635 --> 37:40.681
If this thing goes,
the nuclear physics lab goes with it.

37:40.681 --> 37:43.517
- Do it now, Janet.
- Oh, God.

37:44.101 --> 37:46.896
MacGyver! He's coming around.

37:47.062 --> 37:50.900
- Call the bomb squad.
- There's no time.

37:51.692 --> 37:54.320
We're the bomb squad.

38:04.121 --> 38:08.375
David... Sit up, son.

38:08.542 --> 38:11.712
Sit up. Oh, God.

38:14.923 --> 38:16.800
I'm sorry, son.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.928
There's got to be a litre
of nitroglycerine in here.

38:19.928 --> 38:23.807
MacGyver, just get David out of here.
I'll take care of the bomb.

38:23.807 --> 38:26.977
Trust me, professor, there's no time.

38:26.977 --> 38:29.313
It's gonna take two of us to do this.

38:29.313 --> 38:31.190
I'm gonna need some tools,

38:31.190 --> 38:34.193
flat-head screwdriver
and needle-nose pliers.

38:34.193 --> 38:36.445
I've got that kind of stuff here.

38:36.445 --> 38:39.031
In my desk.

38:40.365 --> 38:44.286
- Forgive me, I'm a little nervous.
- I'd be worried if you weren't.

38:44.286 --> 38:47.831
- Wire cutters.
- No, he's built a collapsing circuit.

38:47.831 --> 38:50.834
Cut a wire and she blows.

38:51.001 --> 38:54.963
- How's he triggered it?
- That's a mercury switch.

38:54.963 --> 38:58.800
That glob of mercury touches
any of the exposed wires...

38:58.800 --> 39:00.719
...the bomb goes off.

39:00.719 --> 39:05.140
Yeah. The timer is set
to tilt the dish with the mercury.

39:05.140 --> 39:06.850
Four and a half minutes.

39:06.850 --> 39:11.563
Yeah, we've got to get inside
and stop that timer.

39:23.283 --> 39:25.869
Wait a minute, stop!

39:29.873 --> 39:32.500
He's got the screws wired.

39:39.716 --> 39:41.759
No way to disarm this bomb.

39:41.759 --> 39:44.596
We're going
to have to contain the blast.

39:44.596 --> 39:48.183
That's the only way we're
gonna save the nuclear physics lab.

39:48.183 --> 39:50.768
Contain?

39:50.852 --> 39:53.396
The elevator.
Get it to the sub-basement.

39:53.396 --> 39:55.773
How do you move it
with a mercury switch?

39:55.773 --> 40:01.279
Sir, you once said,
"There's no problem without a solution."

40:03.781 --> 40:06.367
Liquid nitrogen.

40:06.492 --> 40:12.457
- Freeze the mercury! It's worth a try.
- I'll get the elevator.

40:45.656 --> 40:48.868
No good. No good, it won't freeze.

40:49.034 --> 40:53.289
- That mercury's too far down in there.
- We've got to get it to the elevator.

40:53.289 --> 40:56.584
MacGyver, it's over 20 yards.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.336
David.

41:00.629 --> 41:04.592
David! How do we disarm the bomb?

41:05.259 --> 41:08.971
Can't. Got to get out...

41:10.973 --> 41:13.684
Professor, we've got to move it.

41:13.684 --> 41:16.478
- How?
- Very carefully.

41:18.564 --> 41:21.191
Give me a hand here.

41:21.567 --> 41:28.282
- There's got to be a better way.
- If you come up with it, let me know.

41:28.282 --> 41:30.868
Ready?

42:55.368 --> 42:57.954
Easy, professor.

43:06.713 --> 43:09.299
A minute fifteen.

43:17.140 --> 43:19.726
Watch it here.

43:28.818 --> 43:31.821
- No! No!
- Oh, God!

43:33.364 --> 43:36.867
Fifty-five seconds.
We've got to defuse it.

43:36.867 --> 43:39.704
I can't begin to think
under this pressure.

43:39.704 --> 43:42.331
Pressure! That's it!

43:43.749 --> 43:46.252
- What?
- Gas pressure.

43:46.252 --> 43:48.462
If I can heat that switch,

43:48.462 --> 43:51.090
I can bust it wide open.

43:51.924 --> 43:55.094
I'm not sure I understand.

43:55.261 --> 44:01.225
We need to get these wires
between the panels. Pry open the lid.

44:09.942 --> 44:13.445
If I can get these wires hot enough,
it'll cook the mercury.

44:13.445 --> 44:17.157
And heat it to a gaseous state!
Of course.

44:17.157 --> 44:19.785
Twenty seconds...

44:25.582 --> 44:28.210
Come on.

45:07.416 --> 45:09.501
You're gonna be all right, David.

45:09.501 --> 45:12.421
- The bomb...
- The bomb squad's taken care of it.

45:12.421 --> 45:15.340
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- David, please.

45:15.340 --> 45:18.718
- Don't talk. Be quiet.
- Let's go.

45:27.686 --> 45:29.604
David!

45:29.604 --> 45:32.607
He's gonna be all right.

45:32.774 --> 45:35.360
But it's gonna take time.

45:36.152 --> 45:38.780
Oh, I'll make the time.

45:45.829 --> 45:48.456
Oh, MacGyver...

45:49.541 --> 45:52.127
...thank you.
