08:43.757 --> 08:47.392
You are so adorable!

08:47.394 --> 08:51.162
I can't believe you came
all the way to Paris

08:51.164 --> 08:53.365
just to see me!

08:53.367 --> 08:55.767
Oooh! Mwah!
[Giggles]

08:56.236 --> 08:59.738
The boy genius
who helps Kim Possible?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.440
Apparently,
he has invented a, uh...

09:02.442 --> 09:03.742
love machine?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.744
Father, do you think
this is enough Lagoop

09:05.746 --> 09:07.379
to last me through the weekend?

09:07.381 --> 09:08.380
I hear it may rain.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.382
Oh! You are spying!

09:10.384 --> 09:12.284
I want to peek.

09:12.286 --> 09:16.388
You have your own
opera glasses.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.323
Ron, why are you
encouraging him?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.191
He's just going to get hurt.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.694
Oh, really?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.163
[Giggling]
Ha-ha... Lice.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.264
Wha...? How...?
They look like...

09:26.266 --> 09:27.799
they're in love?
Yeah.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.601
But...
Paris.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.439
To control love
in such a way...

09:34.441 --> 09:36.641
we must steal it and find a way

09:36.643 --> 09:40.478
I am bursting
with pride, my son.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.348
[Giggles] I was looking
over your shoulder

09:43.350 --> 09:44.416
and I read your note.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.218
Junior, that was cheating!

09:47.220 --> 09:49.721
I am so proud.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.627
[Whispering] Are you alone?
Monique?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.761
Why are you a mannequin?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.430
Just avoiding someone.
Who?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.432
I thought you guys
were an item.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.267
I don't know what we are.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.401
All I know is that something

10:03.403 --> 10:05.370
super-freaky weird
is going on.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.138
Hey, Kim.
Hey, girl.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.740
Say what?

10:12.411 --> 10:14.512
[Zap]

10:14.514 --> 10:16.615
Say, what are you doing
over there, baby?

10:16.617 --> 10:19.551
Come give moni-mon some sugar!
Sugar?!

10:19.553 --> 10:22.587
Couldn't you just pour him
on a stack of pancakes?

10:22.589 --> 10:25.156
Did you do something?
Did you see something?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.391
I'm not sure.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.293
Kim just doesn't understand

10:28.295 --> 10:30.629
about us, baby boy.
Baby boy?

10:30.631 --> 10:32.430
No kidding.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.332
[Sniffs]

10:34.334 --> 10:35.400
Ahh-choo!

10:35.402 --> 10:36.434
Good day, madame.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.403
We have a delivery of flowers

10:38.405 --> 10:41.206
from Lontaine?
<i>My</i> husband?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.574
Are you sure you have
the right house?

10:42.576 --> 10:45.377
Yes. This is the house
of the spouse.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.546
Ah-choo! Uh, is he
feeling all right?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.882
No! My eyes are watering,
and I've a...

10:50.884 --> 10:52.317
oh, he is robust.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.318
And now, where would you like

10:53.320 --> 10:56.421
your extravagant fresh flowers?

10:56.756 --> 10:59.257
And what does
my little mannish boy

10:59.259 --> 11:00.392
want to eat?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.495
Something sweet?
Like...

11:03.497 --> 11:04.863
You? [Giggles]

11:04.865 --> 11:07.198
This was worth
leaving my room for.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.267
Ok. How about
some yummy pizza?

11:09.269 --> 11:13.438
Or a big old burger and...

11:13.440 --> 11:16.808
ooh. Wait.
What am I... <i>hey!</i>

11:16.810 --> 11:20.211
[Squeals] I think we
should have something

11:20.213 --> 11:21.279
that we should share.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.281
[Gasps] We should
share something.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.383
Let's see...
a sundae!

11:25.385 --> 11:26.317
Ok, ok...

11:26.319 --> 11:27.385
you go find a table,

11:27.387 --> 11:29.954
and I will be right...

11:29.956 --> 11:31.723
There.
[Sighs]

11:31.725 --> 11:33.558
[Giggles]

11:33.826 --> 11:34.759
[Sighs] Dude,

11:34.761 --> 11:37.228
making time with the ladies.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.365
I guess I picked the
right guy to school me.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.633
Word!

11:41.635 --> 11:45.837
Double fudge sundae for
my sweet little thing!

11:45.839 --> 11:48.306
[Giggles]
Mm-wah!

11:48.308 --> 11:49.507
Oops! Forgot a spoon.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.409
Don't miss me too much.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.744
[Giggles]

11:52.746 --> 11:53.745
Heh heh heh.
Wow!

11:53.747 --> 11:56.548
Genius of love, too!

11:58.951 --> 12:00.418
[Gasps] Huh?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.921
Aah! You are playing the wrong...

12:02.923 --> 12:04.956
[zap] [Giggles]

12:04.958 --> 12:08.993
Oh, you are so tasty!

12:08.995 --> 12:10.395
Mmm-mmm!

12:10.397 --> 12:13.898
You just did something
with the bun-warmer.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.000
Can I borrow that?
Mm-wah! Ok,

12:16.002 --> 12:17.569
I gotta go back
to work, but know

12:17.571 --> 12:19.270
I'll be thinking of you.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.006
My little boo.
[Giggles]

12:22.008 --> 12:24.442
Bye!

12:25.445 --> 12:28.513
That's not really a
bun-warmer, is it?

12:28.515 --> 12:29.581
Because my bun is lukewarm,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.015
and Monique
is all hottie-hot.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.784
Ok, it's a device
that makes girls

12:32.786 --> 12:34.853
fall in love with me.
I invented it.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.387
What?!
That's great!

12:36.389 --> 12:38.423
That's... that's
wrong!

12:38.425 --> 12:40.892
Oh, so wrong.
Wait!

12:40.894 --> 12:43.328
It wasn't my mad
love school skills?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.864
Well, you gave me the
idea for the love ray.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.332
That's something.
Me?

12:47.334 --> 12:48.733
No, I didn't!
I meant...

12:48.735 --> 12:50.268
[gasps] Oh...

12:50.270 --> 12:51.469
So when I said...

12:51.471 --> 12:52.704
and then you thought...

12:52.706 --> 12:53.705
then you did...
yep.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.540
Oh, Kim's so gonna blame me.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.876
I just... Wanted Monique
to like me for me.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.378
So you zapped her with a ray?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.713
Inventing things is what I do.

13:01.715 --> 13:06.351
So, in a way, it's liking me for me.
Isn't it?

13:06.353 --> 13:08.052
It... well, yes.
You know, in a way.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.321
A sick and wrong way,

13:10.323 --> 13:14.359
but it is technically a way.
I guess.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.395
Whoo!
When Lontaine sends flowers,

13:17.397 --> 13:18.596
he sends <i>flowers!</i>

13:18.598 --> 13:20.632
And now, I will read the card.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.001
<i>Papi,</i> we do not have a card.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.737
To give you time
to find the item.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.338
Now hurry.
Ah!

13:27.340 --> 13:28.773
[Clears throat]

13:28.775 --> 13:30.742
"To my dearest wife,

13:37.350 --> 13:38.383
Please, shh!

13:38.385 --> 13:40.985
Don't interrupt.
Ooh. Sorry.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.521
Hello, little genius kid.

13:44.456 --> 13:47.425
Oh! The plans
for the love device.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.427
[Printer hums] [Gasp]

I have it!

"Signed, your loving husband.
Happy Valentine's day."

14:03.476 --> 14:04.409
[Door slams]

14:04.411 --> 14:05.510
Well, the flowers are nice.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.679
I don't know
about that card, though.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.480
There's something odd going on.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.916
Today, it was almost like
Wade had some sort of

14:11.918 --> 14:13.117
control over Monique.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.686
What? Control?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.387
Ha! Ha-ha!

14:16.389 --> 14:19.057
They're just 2 kooky kids
in love.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.392
Oh, hey, look!
Ha! TV.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.627
Love?
Monique was pretending

14:22.629 --> 14:24.095
to be a mannequin to avoid him.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.598
My favorite show!
It's... weather.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.099
Yeah?
It's partly cloudy

14:28.101 --> 14:29.133
and completely weird.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.435
[Beeping]

14:30.437 --> 14:31.469
Yo, Wade.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.404
Oh, hey, Kim.
Um... Is Ron there?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.907
Yeah.
It's for you.

14:35.909 --> 14:39.143
It looks like junior and senior

14:39.145 --> 14:41.412
have stolen plans to...

14:41.414 --> 14:42.413
A certain device

14:42.415 --> 14:44.415
from my room.
What sort of device?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.416
Um... Uh...

14:45.418 --> 14:47.118
Eh... Well,
ok, ok!

14:47.120 --> 14:48.486
Wade invented
a bun-warmer

14:48.488 --> 14:51.022
that makes girls
fall in love with him.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.857
I knew that bun-warmer
wasn't right!

14:52.859 --> 14:54.692
Wade: It was Ron's idea!
What?

14:54.694 --> 14:55.727
Not intentionally!

14:55.729 --> 14:57.562
Wade! What
were you thinking?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.897
I just really like Monique.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.465
I promise I won't use it again.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.966
I'm disappointed
in both of you.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.502
Let's not play
the blame game, K.P.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.870
Unless you spot me 10 points

15:05.872 --> 15:07.105
and give me a head start.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.107
All right. If senior
has these plans,

15:09.109 --> 15:10.141
what's the worst case?

15:10.143 --> 15:13.411
The sonic effect is
short-range and short-term.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.847
So maybe there's some rich
woman that senior's after?

15:15.849 --> 15:20.118
Who won't go out with him
because he's too young.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.653

15:21.655 --> 15:24.656
TV announcer: The
Ear-splitters rock Lowerton.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.624
The loudest band on the planet.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.526
Live tonight
at the Lowerton arena.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.727

15:29.729 --> 15:32.430
million mega-watt

15:32.432 --> 15:34.499
Your ears
will be ampli-fried!

15:34.501 --> 15:37.101
Wade? What if senior tried
to amplify the love ray?

15:37.103 --> 15:40.171
Like, you mean,
with a million mega-watts?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.639
Oh, that'd be bad.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.608
Mmm.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.112
Hey, guys. Don't know
if you've heard.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.214
Senior's planning
a huge concert,

15:50.216 --> 15:53.651
so that's how they're going
to use the cupid ray

15:53.653 --> 15:55.453
to control women
all over the world.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.522
K.P., this concert
is free!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.457
Booya, we are so there!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.993
Oh, man, ladies only?!
Well, that tanks.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.262
Trap, Ron. We're not
going to the concert,

16:04.264 --> 16:07.865
and I'm going, too.
This is all my fault.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.233
Well, Ron gave me the idea.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.902
Ah! I have
lots of ideas!

16:10.904 --> 16:12.737
People usually
don't act on them!

16:12.739 --> 16:14.238
I want to help
set things right.

16:14.240 --> 16:19.577
Promised. This has caused
enough trouble.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.515
Don't y'all be drivin' off
before I get my say!

16:24.517 --> 16:26.684
Wade, word.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.587
Uh, Monique,
we were in a hurry.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.122
Can you guys deal later?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.891
Sorry, Kim.
Dealing now.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.226
Wade, what you did was...

16:35.228 --> 16:38.229
[squealing] So adorable!

16:38.231 --> 16:43.034
Ah, sorry. We really don't
have time for this.

Don't leave me!

16:49.275 --> 16:52.710
Oh, fine!
Bring her along.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.085
I cannot believe you
used science for evil.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.655
I don't care what it was for!
Guys, shut!

17:04.657 --> 17:07.125
Monique, don't make me
zap you again.

Hmmph!

17:13.066 --> 17:15.533
We'll need to find
a different way in.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.002
I'll use my new grappling belt.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.307
Uh, yeah, good for you,
but what about Monique?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.643
She's grapple-challenged.

17:25.645 --> 17:30.081
Yo, what's wrong with just
going through the front gate?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.182
Right, good idea.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.618
Just one problem...

17:33.620 --> 17:35.853
Ladies only.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.954
[Both gasp]

17:36.956 --> 17:39.290
Oh, no, you don't.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.025
They did.

17:41.027 --> 17:45.763
Of course, I was brain-switched
with Kim at the time.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.199
With the speakers
and this love apparatus,

17:48.201 --> 17:50.835
