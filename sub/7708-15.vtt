WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:04.503
There I was, on a lonely
deserted mountain road

00:04.505 --> 00:06.972
in the middle of the night,
when suddenly

00:06.974 --> 00:08.774
my breaks failed
on the downgrade.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.777
Oh, Maxine, you must have been
scared out of you wits.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.479
Let's just say I was screaming

00:13.481 --> 00:15.681
my mantra at the
top of my lungs.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.183
I'll bet.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.519
I kept going faster and faster

00:20.521 --> 00:23.255
when, suddenly, another
power took control

00:23.257 --> 00:25.457
and-and pushed me
into the passenger seat.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.961
Usually, I don't let other
people drive my car.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.664
And that was the first
time you met, uh--?

00:32.666 --> 00:34.700
What did you say
your friend's name was?

00:34.702 --> 00:37.703
Vlad. The warrior god.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.173
[sighs]
Maxine, this is fascinating.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.510
But where would a
6000-year-old Mayan warrior

00:44.512 --> 00:46.712
learn to down-shift a Toyota?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.515
I know you're skeptical.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.550
But if it wasn't for Vlad..

00:51.552 --> 00:54.420
...I wouldn't be alive
to be reunited with Neal.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.323
Did you say "reunited"?

00:58.325 --> 01:01.527
Ours has been one of the great
romances throughout history.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.763
Didn't Neal tell you?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.032
Well, we haven't spoken
in a couple of days.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.735
- Would you like some more tea?
- No, thank you.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.403
- Neal?
- No, thank you.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.772
I think I'll get us some anyway.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.974
- I'll give you a hand.
- Come on.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.284
Do you like 'em?

01:25.286 --> 01:28.487
How can I like them after what
they did to my village?

01:30.558 --> 01:33.592
Alright, who wants to go first?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.128
ALF, it's easy to criticize,
but the world

01:36.130 --> 01:38.897
is made up of all kinds
of different people.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.266
As we've seen this
evening Maxine herself

01:41.268 --> 01:43.602
is made of seven
or eight of them.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.205
Still, if she
marries into the family

01:46.207 --> 01:48.507
do I have to hide from Vlad?

01:48.509 --> 01:50.809
Well, we'll just have to..

01:50.811 --> 01:54.213
..meet Vlad and
make that decision then.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.881
Shh.

01:55.883 --> 01:59.418
Hey, look at it this way.
You haven't lost a brother.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.086
You've gained a god.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.089
[all laughing]

02:07.027 --> 02:10.028
[theme music]

02:37.057 --> 02:40.058
[music continues]

03:08.355 --> 03:09.821
[instrumental music]

03:11.859 --> 03:14.626
You will all be
glad to see me burn.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.228
But if I go through the fire.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.330
I shall go through
it to their hearts.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.898
Forever and ever.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.701
And so, God be with me.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.238
Not bad. Now do it again.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.241
And this time, try
to show a little leg.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.945
Alf, I'm auditioning
for Joan of arc.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.813
I don't really think that
would be appropriate.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.815
Just tell me if I've
got the lines right.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.684
Okay. But I'm telling you.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.985
It would be a lot funnier

03:39.987 --> 03:42.187
if you were holding
a rubber chicken.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.590
It's not a comedy.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.125
Well, not the way
you're doing it.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.895
Hey, I've got a great idea!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.964
When they strike the first torch

03:51.966 --> 03:54.633
grab your big toe and hop around

03:54.635 --> 03:57.169
yelling, "Hot foot! Hot foot!"

03:58.372 --> 04:00.572
I'm tied to a stake!

04:01.475 --> 04:03.675
You're tied to a piece of meat

04:03.677 --> 04:06.178
and you don't see
the humor in that?

04:06.180 --> 04:08.046
No.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.681
Well, then you might
want to consider

04:09.683 --> 04:12.484
a couple of well-placed tassels.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.986
Thanks.

04:13.988 --> 04:17.055
- You've been no help at all.
- What's wrong?

04:17.057 --> 04:18.790
He wants me to hold
a rubber chicken

04:18.792 --> 04:21.393
and wear tassels.

04:21.395 --> 04:24.663
I guess he figures 'cause
he got Brian to do it once.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.431
[knock on door]

04:26.433 --> 04:28.100
Oh. Alf.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.638
It's Neal.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.772
Oh, great.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.974
God's gag gift to women.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.310
- Hey, Neal.
- Willie.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.480
The most amazing
thing just happened.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.215
- Hi, Uncle Neal.
- Hi, Neal.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.616
It's incredible.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.351
It caught me
totally by surprise.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.719
You won't ever guess what it is.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.788
Your ex-wife's coming to town.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.291
Brian, please. Go on, Neal.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.092
Actually, that's it.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.794
How did you know?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.996
It's his standard guess.

04:58.866 --> 04:59.965
Well, anyway, you'll never guess

04:59.967 --> 05:01.933
why she's coming to town.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.869
She wants you back?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.906
Can you bend spoons, too?

05:08.942 --> 05:11.943
Wha...Neal, when did
all this happen?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.247
[car horn honks]

05:15.249 --> 05:16.682
[sighs]
That's my ride.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.016
Gotta go.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.552
We'll see you.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.587
You know, Neal,
that really is amazing.

05:22.589 --> 05:26.058
I can't believe that Margaret,
after all she's put you through

05:26.060 --> 05:28.093
that she would have
the nerve to call you up

05:28.095 --> 05:29.661
and ask you to take her back.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.263
It must have felt really good

05:31.265 --> 05:33.365
to finally tell her off, eh?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.267
Well, I...I suppose it would

05:35.269 --> 05:37.269
had I taken that approach.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.639
Don't tell me you're actually

05:40.641 --> 05:43.842
considering taking her back!

05:43.844 --> 05:46.478
Willie, I don't understand
what you-what you find so wrong

05:46.480 --> 05:47.846
with my wanting to
go back to someone

05:47.848 --> 05:50.615
I spent ten years
of my life with!

05:50.617 --> 05:52.384
Neal, get a clue.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.252
They hate her!

05:56.223 --> 05:58.357
Willie, is that true?

05:58.359 --> 06:02.094
Willie...now, Margaret
does have her sweet side.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.964
Oh, you're not still
buying into that

06:05.966 --> 06:09.034
"Poor little helpless me"
act of hers, are you?

06:09.036 --> 06:11.536
I mean, she walked out on you.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.004
Neal, even if she weren't

06:13.006 --> 06:15.807
manipulative,
domineering, selfish..

06:15.809 --> 06:17.709
Honey, honey. Shh.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.945
Those are his words.

06:19.947 --> 06:25.217
Still, Neal may not wanna
hear them again right now.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.853
I think what Kate
is trying to say

06:27.855 --> 06:29.855
and she speaks for all of us

06:29.857 --> 06:32.858
is you're in it so deep,
we're all giving up.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.764
[instrumental music]

06:40.801 --> 06:43.802
So, what shall we
watch on TV tonight?

06:43.804 --> 06:47.739
I've narrowed it down to
"Nova: Inside the Atom".

06:48.208 --> 06:49.408
Eh.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.643
And-and I'm not
lobbying for this.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.247
"My Mother the Car!" Yeah!

06:55.249 --> 06:57.416
I'm not watching a show
where someone's mom

06:57.418 --> 07:00.218
comes back as a talking car.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.522
What do you mean? You laugh
at "Mister Ed" every night.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.090
It's entirely different.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.393
[sighs]
It's a talking horse.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.028
What's the difference?

07:10.998 --> 07:14.766
First of all,
Ed did not "come back".

07:14.768 --> 07:17.869
And second,
there's no physical way

07:17.871 --> 07:20.005
that a car can talk.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.374
Well, that's not
necessarily true.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.443
- If, let's say, the car--
- Honey, honey.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.745
Please don't let him suck
you into this conversation.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.447
- I'm gonna win this time.
- Mm-mmm.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.848
Listen, a car is a machine--

07:29.850 --> 07:31.316
Well..

07:31.318 --> 07:32.884
...guess what happened.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.619
You didn't get the part.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.388
Will you stop that!

07:36.390 --> 07:37.789
Tell us, honey.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.058
I didn't get the part.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.793
There'll be other roles.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.363
I know. I got one.
It's one line.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.967
I share it with six other
students. I'm a knight.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.369
I don't even get to
play my own gender.

07:51.371 --> 07:54.840
I told you you should've
shown a little leg.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.007
[knock on door]

07:56.009 --> 07:57.943
(Neal)
'It's me, Neal.'

07:59.480 --> 08:01.046
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.949
Willie, I wanna thank
you for forcing me

08:03.951 --> 08:07.118
to see what
a...a fool I've been.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.453
What are you
talking about, Neal?

08:08.455 --> 08:10.889
Well, I was up all night
thinking about Margaret

08:10.891 --> 08:12.123
and-and you were right.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.793
I mean, we had an
empty marriage.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.395
She used me as her cook,
her masseur

08:17.397 --> 08:19.631
until just the right
credit dentist came along.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.133
I mean, I don't know why
I didn't see through her.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.536
You could barely see around her.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.039
So, I acted on my feelings

08:28.041 --> 08:30.242
and I-I did the
only thing I could.

08:30.244 --> 08:33.745
[gasps]
You threw her body
in the trunk of your car?!

08:33.747 --> 08:35.947
It's always the quiet ones.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.116
No.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.384
Margaret's at the airport

08:39.386 --> 08:41.152
and I told her to
take a cab here

08:41.154 --> 08:43.255
because I didn't
wanna see her alone.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.389
What?!

08:44.391 --> 08:45.557
Well I didn't think

08:45.559 --> 08:47.526
Willie should reject her
for me on the phone.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.628
It's so impersonal.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.764
Neal, I hope you
understand, for your sake

08:52.766 --> 08:55.033
why Willie can't
do this for you.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.537
Oh, please,
just this once Willie.

08:58.539 --> 08:59.905
[chuckling]

08:59.907 --> 09:01.373
Forget it.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.843
Fine. I'll do it myself.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.746
But this is the last
favor I do for you.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.048
Spoken like a true invertebrate.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.419
[instrumental music]

09:16.957 --> 09:19.324
What could be
taking her so long?

09:19.326 --> 09:22.127
Maybe she met another
dentist on her way here

09:22.129 --> 09:24.930
and is being worked
on as we speak.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.365
What?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.935
[doorbell rings]

09:29.937 --> 09:33.138
Willie, at least
tell me what to do.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.040
Just be honest, Neal.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.342
Tell her that you
appreciate her feelings.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.978
You just don't
happen to share them.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.846
Yeah, and don't let the door

09:41.848 --> 09:44.182
hit her big butt on the way out.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.084
- ALF!
- I've seen pictures.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.686
I'm allowed an opinion.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.593
Hello, Neal.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.529
Margaret!

09:57.531 --> 09:58.830
You look..

09:58.832 --> 10:00.332
...wonderful!

10:00.334 --> 10:03.001
W-wh-what'd you do to yourself?

10:03.003 --> 10:06.471
Oh, gosh. Well, let's see, uh..

10:06.473 --> 10:08.907
...it was a combination
of joining a gym..

10:08.909 --> 10:10.942
...running three miles a day..

10:10.944 --> 10:12.410
...eating only healthy foods.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.613
But mostly it was
the extensive surgery.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.218
Most women wouldn't
be so honest about that.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.954
I think I've paid the price
for lying, don't you?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.064
You look well.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.532
So do you.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.468
'Uh..'

10:37.638 --> 10:40.639
So how much did you lose,
60, 80 pounds?

10:42.009 --> 10:44.209
You always did know
the right thing to say.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.181
I know I've hurt you.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.350
And I have no right

10:52.352 --> 10:54.552
to ask you to give
me another chance.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.992
But I'm asking.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.662
Get your popcorn.
Get your flakes.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.031
Get your sugar daddies.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.766
Get away from the pass-through.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.167
Give him a little privacy.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.236
But she's got him
on the ropes, Willie.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.571
She's pounding his midsection.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.974
What's keeping him up?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.309
Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

11:18.311 --> 11:19.778
[whispering]
What? What?

[jazz music]

11:25.385 --> 11:27.585
Not since Tyson and Givens

11:27.587 --> 11:30.388
has a man been so
outmatched in the ring.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.730
[instrumental music]

11:40.167 --> 11:41.633
We should invite
Margaret and Neal

11:41.635 --> 11:43.134
to go to the movies with us.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.969
Huh! Only if you
take them to see

11:44.971 --> 11:47.172
"Throw Margaret from the Train."

11:47.908 --> 11:49.207
ALF, Margaret and Neal

11:49.209 --> 11:51.109
have rekindled
something in each other

11:51.111 --> 11:53.745
and no matter how
much that repels us

11:53.747 --> 11:56.581
it looks like she's gonna
be around for a while.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.750
- Willie.
- I'm sorry, Kate.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.919
I don't like her.
I didn't like her then

12:00.921 --> 12:03.121
and I don't trust her now.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.656
Oh, what the heck?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.558
Let's go to the movies.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.660
Well, anyway,
it's not for us to judge

12:08.662 --> 12:10.428
what mutually
destructive qualities

12:10.430 --> 12:12.931
two people need
to make them happy.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.400
I think we should
just stay out of it.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.001
It's too late, anyway.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.404
The guy's so
ripped, he's butter.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.707
Just stay out of trouble.

[shower running]
Yeah, is Willie there?

12:51.838 --> 12:53.671

12:53.673 --> 12:57.575
Darn, we're so excited about our
news and there's nobody to tell.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.844
Oh, then let me find someone.

with the news, huh?

are getting married.

'Honey?'

13:16.863 --> 13:18.930
Uh, listen, I gotta go.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.666
Uh, tell everybody the
good news for me, okay? Bye.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.001

...hang up.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.205
Oh!

13:27.207 --> 13:29.541
This had to happen on my watch.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.711
Do I sit by and do nothing

13:33.713 --> 13:36.581
or risk all and save
the poor schlub?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.318
Well..

13:40.320 --> 13:42.687
...it is Vegas.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.923

13:56.736 --> 13:59.337
we're going to be
husband and wife.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.506
Again.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.475
And my sister and her four sons

14:04.477 --> 14:06.377
could move back in with us.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.010
...it wouldn't be so bad if we
lived in Los Angeles, would it?

14:39.012 --> 14:42.580
Do you have to make an issue
out of where we're gonna live?

14:42.582 --> 14:45.416
Well, it-it's just that I-I
like Los Angeles, and I--

14:45.418 --> 14:49.888
Honey, let's not argue
on our wedding night.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.891
Let's pop for the
swankiest room in town.

I'd like to freshen up for you.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.656
I'm still not happy
with this face.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.700
You really stepped
in it this time, Neal.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.469
Have you gone crazy?
What are you doing here?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.538
I came to see Rickles.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.941
I came to stop you from making

15:42.943 --> 15:45.610
the biggest
mistake of your life.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.844
Again.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.713
Do Willie and Kate
know you're here?

15:48.715 --> 15:51.783
Yeah, yeah. I had a hall pass.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.320
Look, ALF, I appreciate
your concern.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.156
But this is none
of your business.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.958
I wanna do this.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.493
Well, if I were a
strict Freudian

16:02.495 --> 16:05.763
I'd say your forays
into oncoming traffic

underlying scarediness.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.704
You picked up on that, huh?

16:12.706 --> 16:15.139

thinking about, man?

...we were..

16:18.144 --> 16:20.144
...in the throes of, well..

Whoa! Stop. Stop.

Stop, stop.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.318
Why am I doubting myself?

16:27.320 --> 16:31.422
Could it be because your blood's
on its way back to your brain?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.391
What am I doing?

16:33.393 --> 16:34.859
I'm just gonna go in there

16:34.861 --> 16:38.496
and put this happiest
day of my life behind me.

get a free pull on the slots.

you man and wife.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.479

are on the table.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.618

Now, the basic wedding is $45.

17:55.809 --> 17:59.043
The videotape, the flowers, and
the rice, that's an extra 75.

17:59.045 --> 18:03.648
We offer an Elvis witness for
$50 or the fat Elvis for 35.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.317

18:06.319 --> 18:08.853

to go to Texas for that.

run to the rest room

18:58.571 --> 19:00.538
Neal, you're in luck.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.839
I found a girl for you that

19:01.841 --> 19:04.709
has all the qualities
Margaret lacks.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.911
Plus she takes Visa.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.181
Why do you suppose that is?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.983
Put that down.

Okay.

So, are you married?

19:14.888 --> 19:16.254
No.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.755
We got as far as the vows

19:17.757 --> 19:21.893
and I realized that
I don't love her anymore.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.394
Yes! Yes!

19:23.396 --> 19:24.896
Start the car!

19:24.898 --> 19:27.231
Hop in the backseat. I'll drive.

19:27.233 --> 19:31.068
This way we won't attract
attention to ourselves.

the only one who will want me?

Then...take this
sock of quarters

19:39.679 --> 19:41.612
and buy a gun.

That's it.

I go-I gotta tell her.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.052
I-I just don't know how
to break it to her. I..

Try to imagine life
in ten years.

should kick in after that.

Nobody came.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.182
Pretty flimsy.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.718
Yeah.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.788
I know.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.122
What's the matter?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.692
You can tell me anything.
You know that.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.729
Margaret...I--

20:31.731 --> 20:33.764
Wait, wait.
Let's get married first.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.099
We can talk later.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.302
Believe me, I never
wanted to hurt you.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.875
Margaret...don't
do this to yourself.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.210
Get your own plate.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.079
Margaret, give me this.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.315
You have never
forgiven me, have you?

20:51.317 --> 20:53.184
No, it's not that.

20:53.186 --> 20:55.853
It's just that..

20:56.956 --> 20:59.156
I don't love you
anymore, Margaret.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.226
I don't understand.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.562
Just three hours ago in
short, quick breaths

21:04.564 --> 21:06.030
you made it quite clear that--

21:06.032 --> 21:08.299
I know, I know but I think
that came more out of

21:08.301 --> 21:10.768
who we used to be
than who we are now.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.405
I never should have left you.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.640
Maybe.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.877
But we're different people now.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.879
And hopefully we'll
come out of this

21:21.881 --> 21:24.015
stronger and better.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.785
Well, I guess that's that.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.689
Still friends?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.225
Oh, of course.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.468
Can I give you a lift back?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.836
Nah.

I've got a thumb
and a pretty nice leg

- I know.

22:18.104 --> 22:21.672
I-I really feel you
made the right decision.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.009
I tell you, it was a pretty
painful, lonely drive back.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.478
Quit complaining.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.980
You slept most of the way.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.949
I still say you did
the right thing.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.552
I just expressed that, honey.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.320
Oh, good.

The only thing I
question is the wisdom

22:38.091 --> 22:42.159
of taking ALF to
see a Las Vegas show.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.329
Oh. Well, Margaret did
leave her parka in the backseat

22:45.331 --> 22:48.399
and fortunately,
ALF looks way over 21.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.835
Still..

22:50.837 --> 22:54.271
Willie, we were at
"Nudes on Ice."

22:54.273 --> 22:57.842
Trust me, nobody was
looking at the audience.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.083
[instrumental music]

23:30.643 --> 23:33.177
Ha ha ha!

23:34.046 --> 23:37.248
[instrumental music]
