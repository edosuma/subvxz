00:00.336 --> 00:02.074
<i>Jedi trapped on Felucia!</i>

00:02.199 --> 00:04.649
<i>Clones are surrounded
by droid forces.</i>

00:04.973 --> 00:07.499
<i>Their only hope
is to escape on Republic gunships</i>

00:07.624 --> 00:10.003
<i>waiting to land
on the embattled surface.</i>

00:10.128 --> 00:13.313
<i>Jedi cruisers have managed
to blow a hole in the droid defenses</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:15.881
<i>and have sent gunships
to the rescue.</i>

00:17.093 --> 00:19.093
Warthog, protect the gunships.

00:19.321 --> 00:21.271
I will take out the fighters.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.377 --> 00:36.987
They made it through the 1st wave.

00:37.112 --> 00:40.062
Concentrate all fire
on the cruiser on the left.

01:07.242 --> 01:09.286
I can't shake these two droids.

01:09.411 --> 01:12.561
Come around,
and I'll try to get them off your tail.

01:15.192 --> 01:16.192
General!

01:24.203 --> 01:25.218
Look out!

01:29.424 --> 01:32.392
- That was close.
- If those fighters got through,

01:32.560 --> 01:35.010
then our gunships
can't be far behind.

01:36.731 --> 01:38.781
Prepare the troops to evacuate.

01:44.225 --> 01:45.225
Go! Go!

01:47.422 --> 01:50.053
Come on, Grunts.
We are leaving!

01:55.833 --> 01:58.983
Ahsoka should be back
from her jungle patrol by now.

01:59.189 --> 02:02.389
I'll try to contact her again.
Ahsoka, where are you?

02:05.218 --> 02:07.218
<i>Ahsoka, what is your location?</i>

02:07.428 --> 02:09.491
About six klicks east, Master.

02:09.799 --> 02:13.049
We've engaged the enemy
and we've got them on the run.

02:16.385 --> 02:18.627
<i>They're here to extract us.
We're leaving.</i>

02:18.752 --> 02:19.752
What?

02:20.248 --> 02:21.608
We can't retreat now, Master.

02:22.039 --> 02:23.539
I've broken through.

02:23.691 --> 02:26.191
Move it, trooper.
Come on, double time.

02:26.632 --> 02:28.365
<i>The droids are retreating.</i>

02:28.604 --> 02:32.158
We're outnumbered. You must evacuate.
That is an order!

02:32.530 --> 02:34.943
<i>Master Skywalker taught me
never to let up</i>

02:35.068 --> 02:37.499
<i>- when the tinnies are on the run.
- They are running back here</i>

02:37.624 --> 02:39.167
to regroup with the main force.

02:45.883 --> 02:48.503
You are putting your troops' lives
in danger, young one.

02:48.628 --> 02:50.942
You will get on the gunship
when we arrive.

02:51.067 --> 02:53.765
- Where's Ahsoka?
- Following your teachings.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.883
- Is she winning?
- For now.

03:05.612 --> 03:08.071
- She's not stopping.
- Land in front of them.

03:11.303 --> 03:12.753
What are you doing?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.540
Get in the ship, now.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.250
Can't you see they're retreating?

03:20.419 --> 03:23.253
They're about to overrun you, Ahsoka.
You just can't see it.

03:23.422 --> 03:25.872
Now follow orders
and get in the ship.

03:43.284 --> 03:44.534
Padawan Ahsoka,

03:44.983 --> 03:48.486
do you feel Master Kenobi's description
of the incident is accurate?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.709
Yes, my Masters.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.733
More to add, do you?

03:53.118 --> 03:54.568
I know I was wrong.

03:55.143 --> 03:57.317
I just got so caught up
in my own success,

03:57.442 --> 03:59.628
I didn't look at the battle
as a whole.

03:59.753 --> 04:02.153
I wasn't being disobedient.
I just...

04:02.711 --> 04:03.671
forgot.

04:03.796 --> 04:06.693
Masters,
this incident is my responsibility.

04:06.818 --> 04:10.668
Because of Ahsoka's advanced abilities,
I forgot how young she is.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.968
I gave her more freedom
than I should have.

04:13.093 --> 04:14.292
That may be,

04:14.417 --> 04:16.973
but it doesn't excuse
what happened on Felucia.

04:17.141 --> 04:20.648
I think she needs some time
away from the battlefield.

04:23.004 --> 04:24.504
On archive security,

04:24.629 --> 04:27.229
reflect on your actions you can,
Padawan.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.734
Guard duty?

04:29.307 --> 04:30.457
For how long?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.054
Longer now.

04:38.803 --> 04:40.881
I'm sorry

04:41.254 --> 04:43.154
- I let you down.
- I know.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.517
I was a Padawan not that long ago.

04:46.326 --> 04:47.726
Madame Jocasta Nu,

04:48.121 --> 04:49.649
this is Ahsoka Tano.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.072
She is to be
your new security officer.

04:52.197 --> 04:53.397
Hello, Madame.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.220
So good to meet you.

04:57.717 --> 04:59.317
Let's show you around.

05:00.312 --> 05:02.282
There is more knowledge here

05:02.407 --> 05:04.557
than anywhere else in the galaxy.

05:05.796 --> 05:07.874
Master Kenobi says
there are even texts here

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
that are forbidden to be read.

05:10.817 --> 05:13.571
The archives
hold a great many secrets,

05:14.477 --> 05:15.527
it is true.

05:15.692 --> 05:19.082
Beyond this door
lies the holocron vault.

05:19.606 --> 05:21.174
The holocrons contain

05:21.299 --> 05:24.874
the most closely guarded secrets
of the Jedi Order.

05:25.695 --> 05:27.545
Good morning, Master Fisto.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.947
Can we go inside?

05:33.171 --> 05:34.871
I'm afraid not, my dear.

05:35.218 --> 05:37.718
I haven't been inside myself
for years.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.849
Only members of the Jedi Council
are allowed access.

05:42.257 --> 05:45.382
Guarding the holocrons
is one of the most important duties

05:45.507 --> 05:47.988
a Jedi can be given, Ahsoka.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.890
- Do you think you're up to the task?
- Definitely.

06:06.831 --> 06:08.811
<i>Excuse the interruption.</i>

06:09.132 --> 06:11.182
<i>As I was saying, bounty hunter,</i>

06:11.318 --> 06:13.691
<i>I have need of your services.</i>

06:13.927 --> 06:15.127
I'm listening.

06:16.343 --> 06:19.484
<i>I need a Jedi holocron.</i>

06:19.806 --> 06:23.256
To get a holocron,
I'd have to break into the Jedi Temple.

06:23.571 --> 06:24.871
It's impossible,

06:25.006 --> 06:26.873
not to mention deadly.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.343
<i>Perhaps your reputation
has been exaggerated.</i>

06:31.817 --> 06:33.692
I want a rogue-class starfighter

06:33.817 --> 06:36.634
with elite weapons,
cloaking device, the works.

06:36.759 --> 06:39.691
And triple my usual rate.

06:40.410 --> 06:42.673
<i>Your price is of no concern.</i>

06:43.517 --> 06:46.091
<i>I will also provide you
with the means</i>

06:46.216 --> 06:48.565
<i>to get inside the temple.</i>

06:49.382 --> 06:50.782
You've got a deal.

06:52.105 --> 06:56.055
The setback at Felucia has affected
our efforts in the whole sector.

06:56.364 --> 06:58.302
It'll take weeks before we can...

06:58.427 --> 07:00.127
Master Yoda, what is it?

07:00.597 --> 07:02.922
A disturbance in the Force.

07:03.446 --> 07:06.420
Intruders there will be
in this temple.

07:13.355 --> 07:16.495
You know, if you would just tell me
what it is you're doing back there,

07:16.620 --> 07:18.655
I could probably be
of some assistance.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.864
Look, I am just doing
some maintenance.

07:22.197 --> 07:24.213
You've been having memory crashes.

07:24.338 --> 07:27.588
That is preposterous.
I have no memory of any crashes.

07:27.932 --> 07:31.125
My goodness.
I have no memory of any crashes.

07:31.305 --> 07:32.305
Exactly.

07:34.326 --> 07:35.426
I am doomed.

07:35.649 --> 07:38.494
- Bane, you have to help me.
- Calm down.

07:38.722 --> 07:39.722
I'm done.

07:40.682 --> 07:42.632
- Thank you.
- Get the door.

07:42.806 --> 07:46.178
I am a techno-service droid,
not a butler droid.

07:46.516 --> 07:49.018
Can it, Todo.
You are what I say you are.

07:49.186 --> 07:50.436
Well! Then...

07:56.040 --> 07:57.140
Who are you?

07:57.571 --> 08:00.821
I am Todo 360, techno-service droid.

08:00.946 --> 08:03.446
- Who are you?
- None of your business.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.340
Everyone is in a good mood today.

08:10.319 --> 08:11.278
Who's that?

08:11.403 --> 08:12.503
Bolla Ropal,

08:12.933 --> 08:15.044
Jedi, out in the Mid Rim.

08:15.212 --> 08:16.419
We going after him?

08:16.544 --> 08:17.395
Soon.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.920
Right now,
we're stealing a holocron.

08:21.410 --> 08:22.593
Impossible.

08:22.761 --> 08:24.575
The only place
you can get a holocron is...

08:24.700 --> 08:25.471
I know.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.289
Inside the main vaults
of the Jedi Temple.

08:28.658 --> 08:32.662
Fortunately, our Sith Lord client
has set us up with some help.

08:33.174 --> 08:36.780
For one, the map of the temple
you're looking at right now.

08:36.905 --> 08:40.818
For another, a security chip
that I've placed in my droid.

08:40.989 --> 08:43.229
I have been given
all the technical data

08:43.354 --> 08:45.680
regarding security systems
in the Jedi Temple.

08:45.805 --> 08:48.275
Both the vent shafts
and the vault itself

08:48.400 --> 08:51.900
are equipped with all kinds of traps
and security measures.

08:52.102 --> 08:53.704
Todo can take them out,

08:53.829 --> 08:57.470
but we'll need help from someone
inside the Jedi library.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.840
And that's where your talents
as a changeling will come in.

09:02.148 --> 09:04.301
He looks like a Jedi.

09:04.599 --> 09:05.599
He was.

09:05.869 --> 09:08.472
His name was Ord Enisence.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.685
You should be able
to walk into the archives

09:11.810 --> 09:13.960
and monitor us without a problem.

09:29.103 --> 09:30.893
Now that I am a Jedi...

09:31.447 --> 09:33.539
I can do that.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.707
Good.

09:34.832 --> 09:36.332
You will need these.

09:36.626 --> 09:39.920
They're ear comlinks
so we can keep in communication.

09:41.327 --> 09:45.331
The vault is in the library, which backs
onto the communications center.

09:45.731 --> 09:47.812
There will be swarms of Jedi nearby.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.037
We'll use that to our advantage.

09:50.282 --> 09:52.996
Even if you get into the vault,

09:53.411 --> 09:55.061
how are you going
to crack that safe?

09:55.230 --> 09:57.280
Let me worry about the safe.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.280
First things first.

10:04.531 --> 10:08.012
Where do we start looking for these
intruders? What could they be after?

10:08.137 --> 10:10.756
I doubt they've come
to hijack starfighters.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.442
What can they get here
they can't get anywhere else?

10:13.567 --> 10:16.156
- Information.
- The Jedi transmitter codes.

10:16.281 --> 10:18.758
Every piece of troop information,
in one place.

10:18.883 --> 10:20.570
And it's all in the east tower.

10:20.695 --> 10:23.756
- The east tower communications center.
- I'll head there right away.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.928
I'll monitor the perimeter defenses
from the central security station.

10:50.469 --> 10:52.327
Good afternoon, Master Enisence.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.252
Good afternoon, young one.

10:54.657 --> 10:56.163
May I be of assistance?

10:58.868 --> 11:00.349
No, thank you, my dear.

11:00.474 --> 11:02.294
I don't want to bother you.

11:02.419 --> 11:04.919
It wouldn't be a bother at all,
Master.

11:05.203 --> 11:08.703
- Things are slow right now.
- I could use something to do.

11:10.851 --> 11:11.990
<i>Cato, come in.</i>

11:12.115 --> 11:13.472
<i>Cato, are you there yet?</i>

11:13.723 --> 11:14.923
Cato, come in.

11:16.101 --> 11:17.019
Thank you.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.794
I'll be fine on my own.

11:19.806 --> 11:20.771
You sure?

11:21.352 --> 11:23.890
Look, youngling.
I said I was fine.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.115
Now let me go about my business.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.717
Can't do anything right these days.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.914
I'm in.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.333
It's about time.

11:40.502 --> 11:42.459
<i>Just tell us where to get in.</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:46.401
{\All right, }There's a weak point in the shield that
Todo should be able to break through.

11:46.526 --> 11:48.215
I'm beaming him the coordinates now.

11:49.254 --> 11:50.754
Okay, I have got it.

11:51.763 --> 11:53.913
I will jam the temple's scanners.

11:54.169 --> 11:56.669
Let's see.
It is around here somewhere.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.089
There.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.900
- In.
- You're welcome.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.195
What was that?

12:10.365 --> 12:13.174
The system is just recycling, sir.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.663
<i>Master, I'm in the tower.</i>

12:15.788 --> 12:17.766
<i>No intruders,
but something just happened.</i>

12:17.891 --> 12:20.456
<i>All the scanners
were behaving strangely for a moment.</i>

12:20.625 --> 12:22.836
{\Yeah, }Something happened
to the system down here too.

12:22.961 --> 12:24.811
It cannot be a coincidence.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.110
Arrived, the intruders have.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.050
But if they are not in the tower,
what are they after?

12:31.219 --> 12:33.995
The communications center,
perhaps, their target is.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.764
<i>They must be
in the central ventilation system.</i>

12:36.933 --> 12:38.516
Let me check the system.

12:38.853 --> 12:41.394
You're right:
there has been a disturbance.

12:41.519 --> 12:43.396
It's near the top
of the south tower.

12:43.565 --> 12:45.215
<i>I'll meet you up there.</i>

12:45.445 --> 12:47.734
On high alert place the temple.

12:55.158 --> 12:58.358
The control board for the fan
should be on your left.

13:02.736 --> 13:03.986
All clear, sir.

13:09.798 --> 13:10.895
Not quite.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.929
The fan you're passing through
has a security switch.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.654
I do not see anything.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.930
Besides,
we have already gotten past the fan.

13:19.898 --> 13:22.448
Todo, we're getting sucked
into the fan.

13:23.709 --> 13:26.009
- Turn it off!
- I do not know how.

13:26.147 --> 13:28.607
- Cato, do something.
- I've got it from here.

13:32.475 --> 13:33.475
Sorry.

13:50.511 --> 13:53.411
Okay, Bane, the next part
is relatively simple.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.171
Make your way down the shaft
until you reach...

13:56.296 --> 13:57.296
Excuse me.

13:57.555 --> 13:59.222
I don't mean to disturb you,

13:59.347 --> 14:03.351
but the whole temple
is on high alert.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.009
Thank you.

14:24.553 --> 14:25.603
This is it.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.599
Perfect.
Let's go in.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.777
Cato, come in.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.136
We are over the vault.

14:31.261 --> 14:34.115
<i>Give me a moment to check out
the security system.</i>

14:34.240 --> 14:35.758
What's wrong with your voice?

14:35.927 --> 14:37.225
Change of plans.

14:37.350 --> 14:38.730
I'm the librarian now.

14:38.855 --> 14:40.013
<i>Hurry it up, Cato.</i>

14:40.138 --> 14:41.931
We can't stay hidden for long.

14:43.129 --> 14:45.798
Well, looks like
this is where they broke in.

14:45.923 --> 14:48.873
Fortunately,
we'll have a less troublesome time.

14:55.785 --> 14:59.698
The vault is filled with laser sensors
that go in every direction.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.308
I'll try to deactivate
the whole system from here.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.424
Just hurry.
I can hear them.

15:04.549 --> 15:07.199
They're looking for us
in the vent system.

15:16.377 --> 15:18.591
Great.
Which way do you think they went?

15:18.716 --> 15:21.124
The communications center
is this way.

15:21.249 --> 15:24.149
We'd better hurry
if we're going to catch them.

15:26.479 --> 15:28.469
The Jedi are coming closer

15:28.688 --> 15:30.937
<i>I've got it.
Go in.</i>

15:47.035 --> 15:48.776
I don't think they came this way.

15:48.901 --> 15:52.502
Master Yoda, are you picking up
any other life signs in this quadrant?

15:52.627 --> 15:55.128
Deep in the temple,
the intruders are.

15:55.296 --> 15:57.423
How are they managing
to stay out of our way?

15:59.217 --> 16:02.067
Possible it is,
receiving assistance they are,

16:02.220 --> 16:03.320
<i>from inside.</i>

16:04.380 --> 16:05.380
Wonderful.

16:06.493 --> 16:07.766
Almost there.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.519
Are you done deactivating
those laser beams yet?

16:11.223 --> 16:13.188
- We are good to go.
- Good.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.524
Start cutting through that wall.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.819
This job just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

16:24.544 --> 16:26.459
Padawan, alert you must be.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.723
Sense deception, I do.

16:29.194 --> 16:31.540
Posing as a Jedi, the intruder is.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.443
Find Master Jocasta, you must.

16:40.341 --> 16:42.507
The two Jedi have turned around

16:42.632 --> 16:44.345
and are making their way
towards you.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.682
Who are you,

16:47.807 --> 16:49.848
and what have you done
with madame Jocasta?

16:49.973 --> 16:52.811
The same thing
I'm going to do to you.

17:28.391 --> 17:31.892
You may have madame Jocasta's shape,
but not her skills.

17:35.562 --> 17:38.483
- Todo, are you done yet?
- These things take time.

17:38.608 --> 17:41.151
Some butler droid
you turned out to be.

17:41.473 --> 17:43.403
I am a techno-service droid!

17:48.701 --> 17:50.501
Looks like you were right.

17:50.867 --> 17:54.667
Master Skywalker, I've captured
the imposter disguised as a Jedi.

17:55.215 --> 17:57.384
She says
the intruder's in the holocron vault.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.312
A holocron is no good
without a Jedi to open it.

18:00.437 --> 18:03.170
- What are they up to?
- They must be trying to gain access

18:03.295 --> 18:05.151
to the communications center
from the vault.

18:05.276 --> 18:06.260
Let's get in{\ there }.

18:08.137 --> 18:10.874
I am not going to be able to do this
without a diagram.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.199
Cato, come in.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.519
- What has happened?
- Something's gone wrong.

18:15.687 --> 18:17.189
Todo, is the hole finished?

18:17.314 --> 18:19.816
- Yes, but...
- Go to the communications center.

18:19.941 --> 18:21.851
- What?
- You heard me.

18:22.027 --> 18:24.768
Bane, the communications center
will be crawling with Jedi.

18:24.893 --> 18:27.343
- Why do I need to go in there?
- Now!

18:55.762 --> 18:58.437
Quick! The communications center.
Let's go.

19:35.688 --> 19:36.859
Hey, guys.

19:40.792 --> 19:41.730
I was just,

19:42.905 --> 19:44.915
testing the access hatch.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.140
Works great.

19:47.617 --> 19:49.905
- Bomb!
- Bomb? What bomb?

19:50.030 --> 19:52.330
Is there something going to blow up?

19:53.198 --> 19:54.203
Bomb!

20:13.408 --> 20:15.956
Madame librarian, are you okay?

20:16.309 --> 20:18.657
I think I'm all right.

20:19.293 --> 20:21.002
We must call security.

20:30.565 --> 20:33.415
Our war operations,
it was never about.

20:35.145 --> 20:38.095
Come on, changeling.
We have a new home for you.

20:39.408 --> 20:42.374
What would someone
want with a holocron?

20:42.971 --> 20:43.995
Wait.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.661
Bolla Ropal.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.717
What did you say?

20:50.965 --> 20:53.546
That's who Bane's next target is...

20:53.671 --> 20:54.671
Some Jedi.

20:56.848 --> 20:59.080
What's wrong?
Who's Bolla Ropal?

20:59.205 --> 21:01.460
He is the keeper
of the Kyber crystal,

21:01.585 --> 21:04.479
the data on which can only be read
by holocrons.

21:04.648 --> 21:05.982
What's on the crystal?

21:06.107 --> 21:09.557
A list of every known
force-sensitive child in the galaxy.

21:09.827 --> 21:13.607
The future younglings.
The future of the Jedi Order.

21:14.075 --> 21:15.366
We have to warn him.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.980
That's going to be hard to do.

21:17.105 --> 21:20.427
He's out of contact,
somewhere in the Devaron system.

21:20.552 --> 21:22.789
Seek him out, you must.

21:22.957 --> 21:25.157
Ahsoka and I
will set out immediately.

21:25.282 --> 21:28.510
If this Cad Bane is still here
on Coruscant,

21:28.635 --> 21:29.835
I'll find him.

21:41.306 --> 21:42.731
<i>Stolen secrets!</i>

21:43.057 --> 21:45.572
<i>Villainous mercenary Cad Bane
was hired</i>

21:45.697 --> 21:47.107
<i>by Darth Sidious</i>

21:47.276 --> 21:50.576
<i>to steal a holocron from the vaults
of the Jedi Temple.</i>

21:50.719 --> 21:52.631
<i>After fleeing
the scene of the crime,</i>

21:52.756 --> 21:55.829
<i>Bane hunted down and captured
Master Bolla Ropal,</i>

21:55.954 --> 21:59.480
<i>who has a crystal which holds secrets
of the Jedi Order.</i>

22:00.952 --> 22:03.709
<i>As a separatist fleet arrives
to help the bounty hunter,</i>

22:03.834 --> 22:07.776
<i>Anakin Skywalker races in to cut off
their escape and stop Bane</i>

22:07.901 --> 22:10.201
<i>from delivering the stolen holocron.</i>

22:12.392 --> 22:14.466
I guess we're going down
with the ship.

22:14.591 --> 22:15.634
Roger, roger.

22:18.397 --> 22:22.147
General, we're receiving
an urgent transmission from the planet.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.170
<i>General Skywalker,
our base has been overrun.</i>

22:31.611 --> 22:34.011
<i>There's no possibility
of evacuation.</i>

22:34.578 --> 22:38.128
<i>They've taken General Ropal
and the holocron memory crystal.</i>

22:38.784 --> 22:40.867
Do you know where
they've taken them?

22:40.992 --> 22:42.042
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

22:42.506 --> 22:45.506
<i>We tried to stop them,
but they left the outpost.</i>

22:46.892 --> 22:49.281
Wait a second.
There's too much interference.

22:49.406 --> 22:51.805
Transmitter's been destroyed
at the source, sir.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.980
We have to find out
what ship Master Ropal was on.

23:16.168 --> 23:18.668
You will remain conscious,
Master Jedi.

23:18.803 --> 23:21.603
The bounty hunter
has some questions for you.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.824
Attach mind limiters, pain pulsers,

23:23.949 --> 23:26.664
and give him a full dose of X-C33.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.545
Right away, sir.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.239
Sir, that Republic ship

23:35.384 --> 23:38.216
has destroyed our escort
and is blocking our escape.

23:38.386 --> 23:40.957
Whoever's commanding that cruiser
is a bold one.

23:41.082 --> 23:44.806
Move us out of the battle zone
and prepare to jump to hyperspace.

23:44.976 --> 23:47.676
I have a small favor
to ask our Jedi guest.

23:52.194 --> 23:55.594
General, a separatist command ship
is fleeing the battle.

23:57.497 --> 24:00.238
You think they have Master Ropal
on board as a prisoner?

24:00.408 --> 24:01.533
I'm sure of it.

24:01.658 --> 24:04.776
Admiral, intercept them before
they can jump to hyperspace.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.870
- I'll ready the troops for boarding.
- Boarding?

24:07.165 --> 24:08.661
We have no boarding craft.

24:08.786 --> 24:11.880
We were prepared to land on the planet,
not to board another ship.

24:12.005 --> 24:13.251
You can't be serious.

24:13.421 --> 24:15.802
I am, Admiral.
Thank you for your opinion.

24:15.927 --> 24:18.465
Now, target their hyperdrive.
We don't want them getting away.

24:30.813 --> 24:32.652
Sir. Captain. Sir.

24:32.901 --> 24:36.441
They hit the power converters,
so we can't go into hyperspace.

24:36.896 --> 24:39.196
I wonder what the Jedi are planning.

24:41.637 --> 24:44.366
I've rounded up three brigades, sir.
Where are we going?

24:44.535 --> 24:46.905
We're going to board
a separatist frigate,

24:47.030 --> 24:50.122
rescue Master Ropal,
and recover an archive holocron.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.199
We have no assault craft, sir,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.292
only a couple of fighters and
the twilight.

24:55.676 --> 24:57.126
Waiting for orders.

24:57.265 --> 24:58.565
And the plan is?

24:59.341 --> 25:00.654
Just curious.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.638
I came down to see
if I could be of any help,

25:07.781 --> 25:09.099
General Skywalker.

25:09.352 --> 25:10.752
Actually, you can.

25:11.003 --> 25:13.061
Activate those walkers, Admiral.

25:14.912 --> 25:16.557
You're not thinking of using those

25:16.682 --> 25:18.910
to transport the clones
to that frigate.

25:19.035 --> 25:21.656
Well, they are pressurized.

25:21.935 --> 25:24.499
And they're equipped with
magnetic feet.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.203
- Good call.
- Master,

25:27.328 --> 25:28.993
you're a genius.

25:29.164 --> 25:31.840
Those walkers designed for terrain,
not space.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.646
Rex, load them up.

25:33.771 --> 25:35.033
Let's go, snips.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.893
Execute battalion, take AT-AT 300!

25:38.018 --> 25:41.255
Carnivore battalion, walker 773!
Let's go!

25:48.891 --> 25:51.575
Simply open this little box of yours

25:51.964 --> 25:54.480
so I can get the information
from this crystal,

25:54.605 --> 25:57.473
and your suffering
will come to an end.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.575
You will never get me...

26:00.700 --> 26:04.091
to unlock the holocron.

26:04.657 --> 26:08.107
Unfortunately, I don't have time
to discuss this with you.

26:08.327 --> 26:10.243
Hit him again...
Full power.

26:14.147 --> 26:16.708
I'm not sure how much more of this
he can take.

26:16.833 --> 26:18.533
Are you a medical droid?

26:20.205 --> 26:21.996
Then step back and shut up.

26:22.121 --> 26:24.290
- Roger, roger.
- More power.

26:36.009 --> 26:38.059
We've lost all his vital signs.

26:38.482 --> 26:39.482
Check.

26:41.637 --> 26:43.485
He is no longer functioning.

26:43.846 --> 26:44.846
Drop him.

26:52.264 --> 26:53.264
He's dead.

26:54.038 --> 26:57.014
Looks like we will have to find
another Jedi to open this Holocron.

26:57.139 --> 26:59.989
Only next time,
I will try a different method.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.746
<i>When Darth Sidious asked me
to loan you the federation fleet,</i>

27:34.871 --> 27:37.122
<i>he didn't say you were going to war.</i>

27:37.754 --> 27:40.254
<i>You have already lost
four of my ships.</i>

27:40.840 --> 27:43.125
<i>I hope you can pay for all of this.</i>

27:43.847 --> 27:47.631
One authentic Jedi Holocron and
the memory crystal I was after.

27:47.801 --> 27:49.842
When my benefactor gets this,

27:50.012 --> 27:52.721
he will compensate you for
your puny fleet.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.474
Sounds like the Jedi want it back.

28:17.748 --> 28:20.176
The Jedi are overwhelming
our vulture droids.

28:20.301 --> 28:22.042
Should we send out reinforcements?

28:23.087 --> 28:24.380
<i>What are you doing?</i>

28:24.505 --> 28:25.905
Did you say, "No?"

28:26.926 --> 28:28.076
Roger, roger.

28:28.233 --> 28:31.804
<i>The Jedi will board the ship and
get the holocron back.</i>

28:31.929 --> 28:35.099
<i>Transmit the information
and close the deal immediately.</i>

28:35.224 --> 28:36.097
I can't.

28:36.222 --> 28:38.671
Only a Jedi can access the device.

28:39.113 --> 28:40.213
Fortunately,

28:40.637 --> 28:43.470
there are two Jedi
on their way to help me,

28:43.595 --> 28:45.941
one more
than we need for our purposes.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.746
<i>You'd better live through this.</i>

28:47.871 --> 28:49.573
<i>I want my money, Bane.</i>

28:50.158 --> 28:51.658
You can count on it.

29:05.998 --> 29:09.828
Wipe all the frigate's memory banks
and destroy every record of our mission.

29:09.953 --> 29:12.049
Initiate the self-destruct sequence.

29:12.174 --> 29:14.972
You, transfer all ship functions
to my wrist-com.

29:15.097 --> 29:18.431
I want control of doors,
gravity generators, everything.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.850
The rest of you,
stay here and defend the bridge.

29:21.975 --> 29:24.125
We're defending the bridge alone?

29:24.481 --> 29:25.831
Against the Jedi?

29:26.229 --> 29:27.651
I hate this job.

29:44.543 --> 29:47.843
Don't shoot! I'm not the Commander.
He's the Commander!

29:50.267 --> 29:52.167
Guess I'm the Commander now.

29:53.302 --> 29:55.702
R2, see if you can find
Master Ropal.

29:58.139 --> 30:01.599
<i>One authentic Jedi Holocron and
the memory crystal I was after.</i>

30:02.742 --> 30:04.521
He has both pieces now.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.297
Rex, send a squad.

30:06.422 --> 30:08.935
Lock down the hangar bay and
destroy all the escape pods.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.610
- No one gets off this ship.
- Yes, sir.

30:12.426 --> 30:15.571
R2, you have to find Master Ropal.
Hurry!

30:16.612 --> 30:17.812
What was that?

30:26.144 --> 30:28.613
One of the engines on that frigate
has exploded.

30:28.738 --> 30:30.837
I caution you to avoid
the AFT section.

30:31.006 --> 30:34.275
<i>- How much damage is there?
- I suggest immediate evacuation.</i>

30:34.400 --> 30:36.600
Not until we get what we came for.

30:37.924 --> 30:38.976
Spread out!

30:39.101 --> 30:42.033
While you take on the clones,
I will separate the Jedi

30:42.158 --> 30:43.958
and lead one of them away.

30:50.957 --> 30:53.275
Master, I found him!

30:57.282 --> 31:00.450
Rex, have some men take
Master Ropal back to the Resolute.

31:00.619 --> 31:03.942
We might not be able to
find the holocron in time, Master.

31:04.067 --> 31:07.624
But if it's destroyed with the ship,
Nute Gunray won't get it either.

31:08.005 --> 31:08.773
Maybe,

31:08.898 --> 31:11.998
but I'd rather return it to
the library personally.

31:14.691 --> 31:15.791
Come on, R2.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.483
R2 says we're close.

31:20.608 --> 31:21.830
Stay sharp.

31:25.367 --> 31:27.017
Switch to night vision.

31:38.949 --> 31:39.949
There!

31:52.004 --> 31:54.554
Welcome, Jedi.
We've been expecting you.

31:56.029 --> 31:57.029
Kill them!

32:04.301 --> 32:06.801
Let's make this
a bit more interesting.

32:08.782 --> 32:09.782
Lock down!

32:15.348 --> 32:17.444
Magnetics!
You were trained for this.

32:23.924 --> 32:26.224
Turn the gravity generators back on.

32:52.384 --> 32:53.422
Check your fire!

32:53.547 --> 32:57.197
Hit one of those shells,
and this fight is over for all of us.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.250
I'll get him, Master.

33:47.869 --> 33:48.902
Ahsoka, wait!

33:49.027 --> 33:50.127
It's a trap!

33:53.180 --> 33:55.918
Ahsoka, wait!
We'll take him together.

34:18.612 --> 34:20.358
You thought you could get away?

34:20.527 --> 34:22.317
You're not much of a challenge{\, youngling}.

34:22.442 --> 34:24.027
I got you right where I want you.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.125
I'm not impressed.

35:00.942 --> 35:03.320
Can you hear me?
Are you all right in there?

35:03.445 --> 35:06.095
I'm all right.
Get back to the hangar.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.819
Find a transport,
but wait for us as long as you can.

35:08.944 --> 35:12.244
- We're on it, sir.
- Ahsoka, do you copy?

35:22.613 --> 35:24.724
There's a power surge heading
toward the bridge.

35:24.849 --> 35:28.635
If you're there, get out immediately.
You must abandon your mission.

35:28.805 --> 35:31.680
I don't have the holocron memory,

35:31.805 --> 35:34.442
and I seem to have misplaced
my Padawan.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.769
The ship is tearing itself apart.

35:36.937 --> 35:40.647
Move off to a safe distance, Admiral,
and await my signal for evacuation.

35:40.817 --> 35:44.649
Of all the Jedi,
why did I have to end up with Skywalker?

35:48.670 --> 35:50.120
I wouldn't do that.

35:50.405 --> 35:53.555
Those binders have been
specially designed for Jedi.

35:54.551 --> 35:57.301
The more you struggle,
the tighter they get.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.372
Impressed now, youngling?

36:00.189 --> 36:01.239
Not really.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.052
Enjoy this while you can, sleemo.

36:12.177 --> 36:15.044
This burning boat is about
to finish us both off.

36:15.169 --> 36:16.706
We have time.

36:17.094 --> 36:20.645
The bond between a Jedi teacher
and his apprentice is strong.

36:20.814 --> 36:24.114
Which means my Master
will be coming for me any minute.

36:27.070 --> 36:29.570
Let's see if we can get him
here any faster.

36:36.382 --> 36:39.251
- You said we'd be safe back here.
- Come on.

36:39.376 --> 36:41.619
There's three of us
and only one of him.

36:41.744 --> 36:43.044
It won't matter.

36:44.589 --> 36:46.920
Sir, a Jedi is coming.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.160
He looks very unhappy.

36:53.475 --> 36:56.096
Your Master has gotten the message.

37:00.896 --> 37:03.396
You have nowhere left to run,
bounty hunter.

37:04.416 --> 37:06.440
Let me worry about that, Jedi.

37:07.253 --> 37:10.820
If I activate this control,
the outside air lock will open,

37:10.945 --> 37:13.131
and she will be sucked
into oblivion.

37:13.256 --> 37:15.141
Do you think you can kill me
and then save her

37:15.266 --> 37:17.353
before she's pulled out into space?

37:17.478 --> 37:19.453
It's a horrible way to die.

37:22.077 --> 37:25.753
Besides,
isn't negotiation the Jedi way?

37:28.703 --> 37:30.715
- What do you want?
- This holocron

37:30.884 --> 37:33.470
carries information
I've been paid to collect.

37:33.595 --> 37:35.773
I can't unlock it, but you can.

37:36.221 --> 37:39.150
The last Jedi who had it
wouldn't open it.

37:39.834 --> 37:42.310
I hope you don't make
the same mistake.

37:45.459 --> 37:47.650
We don't have much time.

37:47.819 --> 37:50.901
Hurry up, Jedi, or she dies.

37:52.739 --> 37:55.115
No, Master! Don't do it!

37:55.284 --> 37:57.116
I can't let you die, Ahsoka.

37:57.345 --> 37:58.525
Master, no.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.999
We'll deal with the holocron later.

38:05.346 --> 38:06.669
How touching.

38:10.090 --> 38:12.240
All units, make for that shuttle.

38:44.916 --> 38:48.501
Captain, the main reactor is exposed.
It will implode at any moment.

38:49.350 --> 38:52.713
Yes, sir. We're trying to make
our way to the shuttle now.

38:52.883 --> 38:55.093
<i>- Get out of there!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

38:55.218 --> 38:58.177
You two find the General and help him.
This frigate's not going to last.

38:58.302 --> 39:00.903
- We have to get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

39:02.420 --> 39:06.060
Come about. We need to put some distance
between us and that frigate.

39:28.656 --> 39:30.505
Now I will combine this holocron

39:30.630 --> 39:34.341
with the memory crystal I acquired
from your dead Jedi friend.

39:41.718 --> 39:44.308
My employers will be most pleased.

40:16.424 --> 40:18.240
<i>Did the Jedi cooperate with you?</i>

40:18.365 --> 40:20.583
With some encouragement.

40:20.708 --> 40:22.622
I have access to the holocron

40:22.747 --> 40:24.764
and all the information
the memory contains.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.142
I only have to get off this ship.

40:27.310 --> 40:30.150
<i>Maybe you should
transmit it to me now.</i>

40:30.275 --> 40:32.835
<i>Then I could send
another ship for you.</i>

40:33.358 --> 40:35.041
No, thanks, Viceroy.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.068
I have a plan for my own escape.

40:44.013 --> 40:45.341
Hold it right there!

40:45.466 --> 40:48.087
You're not going anywhere,
bounty hunter.

40:51.001 --> 40:53.917
I hope you found us
a ride off this bucket.

40:54.087 --> 40:56.068
We've got to leave now.
The reactor's gonna blow.

40:56.193 --> 40:57.963
<i>- We cannot wait.
- You'll have to.</i>

40:58.088 --> 41:00.414
I'm going after that bounty hunter.

41:01.060 --> 41:03.002
Master, wait.
Stop!

41:03.471 --> 41:07.472
This is the way to the hangar.
We must get off the ship now.

41:08.935 --> 41:12.552
- I can't let Bane get away.
- Patience, Master.

41:13.189 --> 41:14.189
Patience.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.522
You're right.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.550
Come on! Come on!

41:51.853 --> 41:54.207
Trooper, did you get the holocron?

41:54.637 --> 41:57.069
- No, sir.
- I'll get it, Master.

41:57.194 --> 42:00.025
No time.
Rex, get us out of here.

42:14.345 --> 42:16.944
It looks like the holocron
was destroyed,

42:17.069 --> 42:19.819
but at least the Separatists
didn't get it.

42:20.811 --> 42:23.340
Bane's dead,
but I can still feel him.

42:38.832 --> 42:39.832
Master,

42:40.303 --> 42:43.444
I'm sorry I let that mercenary
get the upper hand.

42:44.127 --> 42:45.963
It wasn't your fault, Ahsoka.

42:46.088 --> 42:48.533
It was mine, start to finish.

42:53.071 --> 42:53.964
So...

42:54.290 --> 42:56.740
did you manage
to recover the holocron...

42:56.971 --> 42:59.302
or capture the bounty hunter?

43:03.219 --> 43:04.219
I see.

43:05.090 --> 43:08.745
So the mission was
your usual version of success, then?

43:10.390 --> 43:13.577
If by success, you mean I won,
then yes.
