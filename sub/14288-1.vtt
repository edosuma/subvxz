All right, all bets are down.
No more bets, please.

00:33.051 --> 00:37.049
<i>I'm just a bad boy</i>

00:42.435 --> 00:46.303
<i>All dressed up in fancy clothes</i>

00:46.773 --> 00:49.509
<i>I ain't takin' no trouble</i>

00:49.609 --> 00:53.773
<i>To blow my bubbles away</i>

01:00.120 --> 01:01.145
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:01.245 --> 01:04.992
Tail those two guys.
I'm takin' a ride in their car.

01:05.707 --> 01:10.832
"In all the galaxies,
in all the endless reaches of space,

01:11.171 --> 01:14.241
I have found no planet
more blessed than this one."

01:14.341 --> 01:17.244
"And yet,
in its uncontrollable insanity,

01:17.344 --> 01:21.415
the human race seeks to destroy
this shining jewel,

01:21.515 --> 01:26.837
this blessed sphere,
which men call Earth."

01:26.937 --> 01:30.215
"And trapped upon this world of madness

01:30.315 --> 01:32.675
stand I!"

01:32.775 --> 01:34.851
"The Silver Surfer!"

01:36.237 --> 01:41.148
Yeah! Yeah, you tell 'em, Surfman!
You tell 'em!

01:42.243 --> 01:46.397
<i>Life is just a bowl of cherries</i>

01:46.497 --> 01:49.400
<i>I ain't taking no trouble</i>

01:49.500 --> 01:54.572
<i>To turn my nights into day</i>

01:54.672 --> 01:56.748
Hello, little Porsche!

02:02.179 --> 02:05.096
Like to go home with me, little Porsche?

02:07.726 --> 02:10.963
Take me all the way to LA
to see my baby!

02:11.062 --> 02:15.559
<i>I can see all the folks,
they're laughin' at me</i>

02:15.942 --> 02:21.281
<i>Cos I'm just naturally crazy</i>

02:21.573 --> 02:23.862
<i>Bad boy</i>

02:29.164 --> 02:33.243
<i>All dressed up in fancy clothes</i>

02:34.668 --> 02:36.875
Jesse! Jesse!

02:39.924 --> 02:44.087
- Jess, take me with you!
- Nah! Risky, baby.

02:45.137 --> 02:48.091
Jess, I ain't scared of nothin'!

03:07.909 --> 03:10.696
Come on, you little baby Porsche!
Come on! Come on!

03:14.958 --> 03:18.493
Yeah, that's right! Yeah!

03:19.879 --> 03:21.160
All right.

03:21.756 --> 03:24.743
So first I go get the money.
Then I go ask Monica.

03:24.843 --> 03:28.591
I say "Monica,
you ever been to Mexico, honey?"

03:32.307 --> 03:36.851
I say "Monica, darlin',
you coming to Mexico with me?"

03:38.647 --> 03:41.634
"Monica, you coming to Mexico with me!"

03:41.734 --> 03:43.344
Me and Monica!

03:43.444 --> 03:45.554
<i>Cos I'm gonna
tell you how it's gonna be!</i>

03:45.654 --> 03:48.026
<i>Mon-Monica and me!</i>

03:48.824 --> 03:52.691
Me and Monica!
Yeah, me and Monica go to MÃ©jico!

03:56.248 --> 03:59.368
Look at that sky!
We got some music here?

04:06.632 --> 04:08.708
Ain't you pretty?

04:10.553 --> 04:12.629
Disco.

04:13.347 --> 04:15.424
Manilow.

04:16.601 --> 04:21.346
I know what we need!
We need the Killer! The Killer rocks on!

04:21.939 --> 04:25.807
Mr Jerry Lee Lewis
and his pumpin' piano!

04:38.121 --> 04:40.941
<i>If you're gonna love me,
lover, please don't tease</i>

04:41.041 --> 04:43.568
<i>If I can hold you, honey, let me squeeze</i>

04:43.668 --> 04:46.488
<i>Well, my heart, it goes round and round</i>

04:46.588 --> 04:48.740
<i>And my love comes tumblin' down</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:54.879
<i>You leave me... ah... breathless!</i>

04:56.306 --> 04:59.876
<i>Oh, I shake all over,
honey, you know why</i>

04:59.976 --> 05:03.391
<i>I'm sure it's love,
baby, now that ain't no lie</i>

05:04.105 --> 05:07.972
Let me have a look here
and see who's lost a Porsche.

05:08.234 --> 05:11.235
Wow! Holy frijoles!

05:12.530 --> 05:14.321
<i>Breathless!</i>

05:15.074 --> 05:16.948
<i>Ooh, baby!</i>

05:17.410 --> 05:19.532
<i>Mmm, crazy!</i>

05:19.745 --> 05:22.273
<i>Honey, you're much too much</i>

05:22.373 --> 05:24.400
<i>Now you know I can't love you enough</i>

05:24.500 --> 05:26.789
<i>It's all right to hold me tight</i>

05:27.086 --> 05:32.506
<i>But when you love me, love me right!</i>

05:33.049 --> 05:35.587
<i>Come on, baby, now you don't be shy</i>

05:35.844 --> 05:38.371
<i>This love was meant for just you and I</i>

05:38.471 --> 05:42.208
<i>Wind, rain, sleet or snow,
I'm gonna get you, baby</i>

05:42.308 --> 05:44.515
My God! Look at that sky!

05:45.103 --> 05:50.097
<i>You leave me... ah... breathless!</i>

05:55.864 --> 05:58.189
Come on, girl! Damn!

05:58.908 --> 06:02.027
Grandma was slow, but she was old!

06:05.998 --> 06:08.489
Hey, girls! You ever kiss a pig?

06:19.595 --> 06:24.007
I say "Monica! I'm comin', baby!
I'm getting closer!"

06:26.143 --> 06:30.506
<i>Baby... baby</i>

06:30.606 --> 06:32.681
<i>Honey, you're much too much</i>

06:34.233 --> 06:36.309
Shit! A cop!

06:39.947 --> 06:42.189
Jinxed! I swear to God, I am jinxed!

06:43.159 --> 06:46.229
<i>Come on, baby, now you don't be shy</i>

06:46.329 --> 06:48.731
<i>This love was meant for just you and I</i>

06:48.831 --> 06:51.276
<i>Wind, rain, sleet or snow</i>

06:51.376 --> 06:54.070
<i>Honey, Jerry's gonna get you
wherever you go</i>

06:54.170 --> 06:59.591
<i>You... leave me... ah...</i>

07:02.135 --> 07:05.053
<i>Breathless!</i>

07:11.395 --> 07:13.088
Come on!

07:13.188 --> 07:16.308
Goddamn! Piece-of-shit Porsche!

07:24.991 --> 07:26.518
Freeze!

07:26.618 --> 07:30.746
Move away from the car! Let me see
your hands! Get away from the car!

07:31.123 --> 07:34.984
Move! I said move!
Get away from the car, you son of a bitch!

07:35.084 --> 07:37.919
Get away from the car
or I'll blow you away!

08:41.273 --> 08:43.349
Jinxed.

08:53.369 --> 08:56.654
That's right. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

08:58.207 --> 09:00.662
Around the corner. Nobody home.

09:08.091 --> 09:10.379
Baby, I like yellow.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.131
Monica - 19.

09:22.313 --> 09:24.389
Nobody home.

09:26.401 --> 09:27.802
What do you think?

09:27.902 --> 09:29.978
Hey, good idea.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.556
- Hello?
- Who is it?

09:32.656 --> 09:35.559
- Roto-Rooter.
- Hello?

09:35.659 --> 09:39.953
- Who is there, please?
- Is the pool man. I forgot my key.

10:37.052 --> 10:39.128
Monica!

10:44.017 --> 10:49.438
I'm a bear for ya, baby!
I'm sniffin' around your honey tree!

10:56.738 --> 10:58.974
Monica.

10:59.074 --> 11:01.150
You Frenchy!

11:02.785 --> 11:04.861
Who are you, dopey?

11:06.872 --> 11:08.948
Schmuck!

11:11.377 --> 11:13.499
Back to Disneyland for you.

11:16.173 --> 11:18.047
You're so pretty.

11:38.611 --> 11:41.889
<i>Ah, honey, honey, honey,
hold on real tight</i>

11:41.989 --> 11:44.684
<i>And if you love me, love me right</i>

11:44.784 --> 11:49.779
<i>And if you love me, love me right!</i>

11:52.041 --> 11:54.944
<i>Come on, baby, now don't be shy</i>

11:55.044 --> 11:57.535
<i>Cos love was meant for you and I</i>

12:03.844 --> 12:05.717
Cheese!

12:07.222 --> 12:10.125
Hey, Tolmatchoff. Shake it up!

12:10.225 --> 12:13.012
Not there? Do you know where he is?

12:13.770 --> 12:17.507
Yeah. Yeah, it's Jesse.
I just got back into town.

12:17.607 --> 12:21.345
He's holdin' some money for me.
Gotta have it right away.

12:21.445 --> 12:23.936
Hey, babe, come on. Talk to me.

12:26.992 --> 12:29.483
Right. Catch him at work.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.743
Where are you?

12:40.838 --> 12:43.329
Monica.

12:44.175 --> 12:46.713
<i>Don't know much about history</i>

12:47.887 --> 12:50.923
<i>Don't know much biology</i>

12:52.016 --> 12:54.961
- Who's in there now?
- Monica, the French girl.

12:55.061 --> 12:59.548
- They're squashing her now!
- Those guys are like vampires!

12:59.648 --> 13:01.723
They're flunking everybody!

13:02.817 --> 13:05.345
<i>And I know that if you love me, too</i>

13:05.445 --> 13:09.443
<i>What a wonderful world this would be</i>

13:10.158 --> 13:12.863
<i>Don't know much about geography</i>

13:13.912 --> 13:16.829
<i>Don't know much trigonometry</i>

13:17.540 --> 13:20.375
<i>Don't know much about algebra</i>

13:21.336 --> 13:24.171
<i>Don't know what a slide rule is for</i>

13:25.131 --> 13:28.002
<i>But I do know one and one is two</i>

13:28.927 --> 13:31.464
<i>And if this one could be with you</i>

13:32.763 --> 13:35.207
Let me help you with that.

13:35.307 --> 13:37.751
- Sorry.
- That's OK. You're doing great.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.425
Just keep it cute.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.015
Go on, please.

13:47.152 --> 13:50.764
<i>I can win your love for me</i>

13:50.864 --> 13:54.031
<i>Don't know much about history</i>

13:56.245 --> 13:59.982
There's a review in progress.
You can't go in there now.

14:00.082 --> 14:02.239
Hold that for me.

14:03.292 --> 14:06.827
- Hello, sunshine!
- There's an exam going on in here!

14:08.172 --> 14:10.544
Who is this guy? Do you know him?

14:11.092 --> 14:14.710
Fear not. The Silver Surfer
serves those in distress.

14:17.682 --> 14:21.586
- Is this a friend of yours, Monica?
- Oh, no, no. She don't know me.

14:21.686 --> 14:25.185
I'm here from Maintenance.
They sent me to pick up this table.

14:26.816 --> 14:29.936
Are you crazy?
There's an exam going on in here!

14:31.695 --> 14:36.357
- Go ahead. Ask me a question.
- About how long you gonna be, pal?

14:37.242 --> 14:39.686
I gotta get this
down to art class real quick.

14:39.786 --> 14:43.774
They need something to put
a banana on, so they can draw it.

14:43.874 --> 14:47.444
You can't just draw a banana
when it's lying on the floor.

14:47.544 --> 14:50.656
- Now, just a minute!
- What's going on here?

14:50.756 --> 14:53.492
That's a terrible stain.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.745
Somebody ought to call Security
on that young man!

14:56.845 --> 15:00.843
Hey, look at this. Hey, wild man!

15:04.143 --> 15:07.393
The kid's a good sport. Give her an A.

15:08.105 --> 15:11.854
- Can you go on, Monica?
- You sure you're OK?

15:28.709 --> 15:31.579
<i>Don't know much about history</i>

15:32.545 --> 15:35.297
<i>Don't know much biology</i>

15:36.132 --> 15:38.919
<i>Don't know much about a science book</i>

15:39.677 --> 15:42.844
<i>Don't know much
about the French I took</i>

15:43.306 --> 15:46.224
<i>But I do know that I love you</i>

15:47.143 --> 15:49.963
<i>And I know that if you love me, too</i>

15:50.063 --> 15:53.479
<i>What a wonderful world this would be</i>

15:59.989 --> 16:02.396
Hello, kid!

16:03.158 --> 16:05.436
Do you want to go to MÃ©jico with me?

16:05.536 --> 16:08.439
Did you do this because I left
in the middle of the night?

16:08.539 --> 16:13.117
Did I hurt your feelings
because I didn't say goodbye?

16:15.045 --> 16:17.536
You could have cost me my degree!

16:22.803 --> 16:27.374
All right, all right, all right, all right!
I know I'm crazy. I can't help it.

16:27.474 --> 16:29.627
I guess I love you.

16:29.727 --> 16:34.005
Love? We spent one or two nights
together in Las Vegas, that's all.

16:34.105 --> 16:37.967
- Four. Come on. Let's go to Mexico!
- Don't be ridiculous!

16:38.067 --> 16:41.346
- I have to study.
- All right. Bring your books along.

16:41.446 --> 16:44.098
We'll feed 'em to the big turtles!

16:44.198 --> 16:46.274
But I can't, Jesse.

16:47.368 --> 16:51.580
I have to stay in school or my family
won't send me any more money.

16:52.248 --> 16:57.820
Need money? That's what I'm doin' here.
I'm pickin' up a big bag of money!

16:57.920 --> 17:00.531
But you told me
you had lots of enemies in LA.

17:00.631 --> 17:03.964
Yeah, I do, I do! My enemies and you.

17:05.051 --> 17:08.372
- So you're in danger.
- Yeah, I'm a desperado.

17:08.472 --> 17:10.958
Desperado? What does it mean?

17:11.058 --> 17:14.426
It means I'm desperate for you, Monica!

17:15.645 --> 17:21.510
It's like blasting along the highway,
going 90, maybe 100 miles an hour.

17:21.609 --> 17:24.721
Suddenly there's a dip in the road,
to suck your guts out!

17:24.820 --> 17:27.109
Your breath is gone!

17:28.200 --> 17:31.269
That's me around you, sugar! That's me!

17:31.369 --> 17:33.361
Breathless!

17:34.955 --> 17:37.031
You scare me, Jesse.

17:42.546 --> 17:47.754
You can't just burst into a person's life
and explode it all up like this.

17:49.678 --> 17:53.416
Las Vegas was a holiday.
This is my life!

17:53.516 --> 17:56.635
- Come here!
- Oh, no! Go away, Jesse!

18:02.357 --> 18:07.398
You're wrong, you know! Las Vegas
was real life. This here's a holiday.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.777
Then go back to Las Vegas!

18:22.877 --> 18:27.949
A highway patrolman is on the critical list
at Mercy Hospital, Barstow,

18:28.049 --> 18:30.785
after a shoot-out in the Mojave Desert.

18:30.885 --> 18:34.830
He was found early this morning near
a car stolen in Las Vegas yesterday.

18:34.930 --> 18:37.958
The assailant is believed
to be heading for Los Angeles.

18:38.058 --> 18:42.004
A jacket with a wad of money
but no billfold was left at the scene.

18:42.104 --> 18:45.437
- Here we go.

18:48.652 --> 18:52.264
This is where you wanted
to get out, isn't it?

18:52.364 --> 18:55.034
- Here?
- Oh, yeah. Right. Thanks.

18:55.951 --> 18:57.860
- Thanks a lot.
- OK.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.000
Hello, little honey! Tolmatchoff around?

19:09.088 --> 19:11.164
Thank you.

19:14.177 --> 19:16.253
Hey, kemo sabe!

19:17.221 --> 19:19.712
How ya doin'? Hello, kid.

19:20.683 --> 19:22.557
Hey, sheik.

19:23.144 --> 19:27.853
- Got my money?
- He dropped it off yesterday. Back here.

19:29.192 --> 19:32.052
So what's happening
at the kasbah this week?

19:32.152 --> 19:35.222
- I don't know. How's Vegas?
- Great! I met a little girl.

19:35.322 --> 19:39.106
- We're going to Mexico together.
- So you're on the lam again.

19:39.409 --> 19:41.900
Here you go. Payday.

19:44.039 --> 19:48.819
Said to tell you it was a slick job.
He's ready to go again any time you want.

19:48.919 --> 19:51.280
Wait a minute. What is this? Cheque?

19:51.380 --> 19:54.499
This fuckhead,
he couldn't send me some cash?

19:55.300 --> 19:59.162
I don't know, man. I'm just
an innocent bystander. You know that.

19:59.262 --> 20:04.041
- What am I gonna do with a cheque?
- Those guys play it strictly legit.

20:04.141 --> 20:08.337
- Can you cash it for me?
- Not today. All my breadski's tied up.

20:08.437 --> 20:11.299
- What about Berrutti?
- Saw him yesterday in Venice.

20:11.399 --> 20:14.684
He is rolling in cash. Give him a call.

20:15.820 --> 20:20.057
- Tolmatchoff, got the charts?
- Just a second, boss.

20:20.157 --> 20:23.477
So, tell me. Who is this lovely
young thing you came to see?

20:23.577 --> 20:26.365
French girl. Schoolgirl. Great girl.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.817
Kills me!

20:29.917 --> 20:32.407
Yeah. Is Berrutti there?

20:34.713 --> 20:37.204
What time's he gonna be back?

20:39.092 --> 20:42.245
Well, look, tell him... Tell him that...

20:42.345 --> 20:45.582
Tell him Jesse's looking for him.
I'll call back later.

20:45.682 --> 20:46.713
Bye.

20:50.520 --> 20:54.883
There's something else about her,
you know. Something in her eyes.

20:54.983 --> 20:57.344
French, you know?

20:57.444 --> 21:00.813
- God! You're such a fuck-up!
- Yeah, I know.

21:02.531 --> 21:04.689
AdiÃ³s, amigo.

21:31.559 --> 21:34.337
Tolmatchoff!
I told you I smelled something!

21:34.437 --> 21:37.048
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Enright and me were reminiscing.

21:37.148 --> 21:40.343
Remember when you turned in
your buddy Johnny Goddard?

21:40.443 --> 21:43.304
- You guys needed some help.
- It's gonna happen again.

21:43.404 --> 21:47.934
Jesse Lujack? Also known as Jesse
Lee Burns. Also known as Jack Burns.

21:48.034 --> 21:52.105
Five ten, 160 pounds. Age 28.
Medium-length brown hair.

21:52.205 --> 21:56.651
This dump is his last known
place of work. Street punk.

21:56.751 --> 22:01.530
So what? I know him. He worked here.
Made some deliveries a few years ago.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.533
- So has he been around here lately?
- No.

22:04.633 --> 22:07.828
Lieutenant, this person
you're looking for.

22:07.928 --> 22:11.415
- Is he kind of a seedy Vegas boy?
- Yeah, maybe.

22:11.515 --> 22:15.460
Thinks he's cute.
Somebody like that just left.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.629
Bingo!

22:17.729 --> 22:21.430
Accessory to murder!
You know what that means!

23:15.577 --> 23:18.396
Hey, kid. Take those home
and put 'em on your boots.

23:18.496 --> 23:20.572
Hey, wow! Thanks!

25:27.413 --> 25:31.326
Anaheim, San Diego,
Tijuana, points south!

25:34.794 --> 25:37.864
Didn't you have
a different car in Las Vegas?

25:37.964 --> 25:43.006
Yeah. That one's in the shop getting fixed.
This one's just a loaner.

25:48.975 --> 25:51.300
Good wind, huh?

25:52.103 --> 25:54.262
It's so hot. You like it?

25:55.273 --> 25:57.884
Yeah. The hotter the better.

25:57.984 --> 26:02.978
Gotta love those Santa Anas, honey!
Just stokin' up the fires!

26:06.700 --> 26:08.859
Where you goin'?

26:09.912 --> 26:12.284
Downtown. Bonaventure Hotel.

26:13.540 --> 26:16.485
Come on, get in. I know a short cut.

26:16.585 --> 26:18.743
Come on.

26:21.674 --> 26:23.750
Come on.

26:32.308 --> 26:35.926
<i>Open up, honey,
it's your lover-boy me that's a-knockin'</i>

26:36.896 --> 26:41.439
<i>Why don't you listen to me, sugar?
All the cats are at the high school rockin'</i>

26:41.943 --> 26:44.398
<i>Time to get your boppin' shoes</i>

26:44.696 --> 26:48.891
- You know who that is, don't you?
- Yeah. You told me in Vegas.

26:48.991 --> 26:51.696
Another crazy man. Lee Lewis?

26:52.078 --> 26:54.981
Another crazy man? Another crazy man?

26:55.081 --> 27:00.153
No! This is the one, the only,
the original, the true Jerry Lee Lewis!

27:00.253 --> 27:02.707
Listen to this guy! He means it!

27:04.506 --> 27:07.626
Can't stop, won't stop, never stop! Wow!

27:08.051 --> 27:11.385
Jerry Lee - he's burnin'! B-B-Burnin'!

27:18.478 --> 27:22.061
- What's so funny, honey?
- You! Those clothes!

27:22.858 --> 27:25.761
You don't like 'em? I'll take 'em off!

27:25.861 --> 27:28.233
No! Stop!

27:29.197 --> 27:31.682
What happened to the blue suit
you had in Vegas?

27:31.782 --> 27:34.700
- Blue suit?
- Yeah. Your lucky suit.

27:35.119 --> 27:37.491
It wasn't the suit that was lucky.
It was you.

27:37.663 --> 27:42.040
When you walked out,
I started rolling fool's dice.

27:44.003 --> 27:46.906
Fool's dice. Snake eyes.

27:47.006 --> 27:49.082
Double zero.

27:50.259 --> 27:52.335
You roll dice too much.

27:53.095 --> 27:55.171
You think that, huh?

28:02.312 --> 28:07.104
You think maybe I was rollin' dice
when I should have been rollin' you?

28:07.776 --> 28:09.934
<i>Rockin' at the high school hop</i>

28:10.362 --> 28:12.847
<i>Because they're jumpin'
at the high school hop</i>

28:12.947 --> 28:15.023
<i>We're rollin' at the high school hop</i>

28:17.035 --> 28:19.604
- I gotta make a stop.
- But my appointment!

28:19.704 --> 28:22.741
It's all right.
It'll just take a minute.

28:29.673 --> 28:31.463
What is this place?

28:33.717 --> 28:36.579
Friend of mine,
a guy who owes me some money.

28:36.679 --> 28:39.170
He's got kind of an office here.

28:41.558 --> 28:45.010
I like it. It's very sinistre.

28:45.813 --> 28:48.019
Sinister! Spooky!

28:50.526 --> 28:52.768
Can we get something to eat?

28:54.738 --> 28:56.814
Sit down.

28:57.449 --> 29:02.110
Order anything you want, all right?
Arcadia! "Servicio, por favor!

29:03.037 --> 29:05.742
I'll be back sooner than trouble.

29:15.425 --> 29:18.202
I don't care if your mother got syphilis.
I want my money.

29:18.302 --> 29:20.379
Carlito.

29:21.264 --> 29:23.553
I'll call you back.

29:24.809 --> 29:28.338
"Tu estas loco, quÃ© tu haces aqui!
What are you doin' here? Are you crazy?

29:28.438 --> 29:31.971
I was out in Pasadena all day
looking for Berrutti.

29:36.278 --> 29:39.806
The man's been around looking for you!
Twice they've been around!

29:39.906 --> 29:41.767
- For me?
- Yeah! For you!

29:41.867 --> 29:45.200
- What for?
- Cos you shot a cop. What do you think?

29:45.620 --> 29:49.399
This is serious business! You think
you're Jesse James? A pistolero?

29:49.499 --> 29:51.818
"Come and get me, copper!"

29:51.918 --> 29:54.291
No, man. It wasn't like that.

29:56.089 --> 29:59.292
Shit! I gotta find Berrutti!

30:11.354 --> 30:13.422
- Can you cash a cheque?
- Cheque?

30:13.522 --> 30:16.425
Forget it. Loan me 10. Give me 10.

30:16.525 --> 30:19.595
Are you crazy? I ain't got no $10!
I got a buck 80 to my name!

30:19.695 --> 30:23.859
I'll give you a bus pass, man.
Good for the whole month.

30:24.283 --> 30:26.608
You with Jesse? Let me introduce myself.

30:41.383 --> 30:44.134
Hey! Hey, give me back that purse!

30:44.552 --> 30:48.384
There's nothing in there for you!
Give me that purse! Give me it!

30:49.516 --> 30:53.587
Give me that purse, junkie! Help!

30:53.687 --> 30:56.631
Shit! Shit! Agh! Shit!

30:56.731 --> 31:01.011
That's my sapphire!
Hey, there's nothing in there!

31:01.111 --> 31:05.059
There's nothing
in that purse for you, junkie!

31:19.795 --> 31:22.915
- Come on. You don't wanna be late.
- What?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.957
- Come on.
- Wait! My taco!

31:27.594 --> 31:32.386
- Don't wanna miss your appointment.
- Can we go fast again?

31:54.162 --> 31:56.238
What is it?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.739
Jesse, it's so cute!

32:04.046 --> 32:07.212
That's my heart. Don't break it.

32:14.598 --> 32:18.752
- I'm staying with you tonight.
- Not tonight. I can't.

32:18.852 --> 32:22.589
I just wanna sleep with you.
Be nice to wake up together, wouldn't it?

32:22.689 --> 32:24.765
I told you. I can't, Jesse.

32:27.444 --> 32:31.056
I want to know who this joker is
you got this appointment with.

32:31.156 --> 32:33.933
He's a professor of mine. It's business.

32:34.033 --> 32:38.196
- He's helping me get a job.
- Yeah. Gonna sleep with him?

32:38.996 --> 32:41.274
You Americans, you only think about sex.

32:41.374 --> 32:42.608
Sex?

32:42.708 --> 32:45.111
I'm in love with you!

32:45.211 --> 32:47.702
You love me, too. You'll see.

32:50.508 --> 32:52.584
Stop! It's over there.

32:54.136 --> 32:58.383
- I'm gonna park. I wanna meet this jerk.
- No! Let me out!

32:59.266 --> 33:01.507
Get outta here! Go on! Beat it!

33:06.898 --> 33:11.690
Get away from me! Get lost! Get outta
here! I don't wanna see you any more!

33:31.214 --> 33:33.502
- Monica!
- Oh, hello, Paul.

33:34.508 --> 33:36.584
Hey, great timing!

33:44.059 --> 33:45.294
What a dump!

33:45.394 --> 33:49.142
You know Frank Lloyd Wright?
This is Frank Lloyd Wrong!

33:50.441 --> 33:54.386
Sorry you had to take the bus.
I had to chauffeur the famous little guy!

33:54.486 --> 33:59.397
- Is he here? The great Dr Boudreaux?
- Yeah. I told him all about you.

34:02.785 --> 34:04.659
You look terrific!

34:05.997 --> 34:08.565
Really alive!
You really oughta see yourself!

34:08.666 --> 34:11.418
- The wind - it's exciting.
- The wind?

34:12.253 --> 34:14.791
The wind often is exciting.

34:16.716 --> 34:22.422
It's so windy, the wind.

34:23.431 --> 34:25.792
Tonight you're gonna meet Dr Boudreaux.

34:25.891 --> 34:28.846
I want you to charm the guy.
I know that you can.

34:33.398 --> 34:36.518
- Monica?
- What did you tell him about me?

34:37.610 --> 34:40.722
I told him that you were dazzling

34:40.822 --> 34:45.484
and you had this idea how to make
houses out of waterfalls and...

34:46.661 --> 34:49.438
What's the matter? Monica, are you OK?

34:49.539 --> 34:52.234
Yes, of course. Why?

34:52.333 --> 34:55.418
I don't know.
You seem a little distracted.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.835
No. I was thinking.

35:01.967 --> 35:05.004
Dr Boudreaux - I'd love to work for him.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.040
Now, show me which one he is.

35:08.140 --> 35:12.008
He's the little one that looks
so brilliant. We'll find him.

35:12.603 --> 35:16.932
Yeah, I know. They went to see
Carlito, too. What did you tell 'em?

35:17.316 --> 35:21.095
Appreciate it. I can't leave town
till I cash this cheque.

35:21.195 --> 35:26.392
What about Louis Minor or that frizzy,
ditsy blonde he always hangs with?

35:26.492 --> 35:30.241
Shit! Yeah, I'm already looking for
Berrutti. Thanks, Marty.

35:42.590 --> 35:44.666
Thank you, sir.

36:22.755 --> 36:26.966
"...to serve Galactus
and shall do so for evermore."

36:28.594 --> 36:33.089
"If such be my destiny,
willingly do I accept it."

36:34.307 --> 36:37.842
- "My fate."
- Man, you like The Silver Surfer?

36:40.146 --> 36:42.435
Yeah, I like the Surfman.

36:43.274 --> 36:45.343
I think he's a jerk.

36:45.443 --> 36:49.472
No! No, man, he's a hero! He's trying
to save the world from Galactus.

36:49.572 --> 36:52.433
- What's wrong with that?
- He's crazy!

36:52.533 --> 36:57.063
He could get away any time he wants.
He's got the power cosmic.

36:57.163 --> 37:00.483
You know why he stays?
He stays cos he likes it here on Earth.

37:00.583 --> 37:04.111
- He wants to help the people out.
- They don't want his help.

37:04.211 --> 37:09.371
They're always after him.
The cops and the marines. He's a jerk.

37:11.343 --> 37:14.628
Hey, why don't you go lie down
in the road for a spell?

37:15.555 --> 37:17.631
The Surfman's a jerk!

37:22.396 --> 37:24.840
"Love is the power supreme."

37:24.940 --> 37:28.060
Hey, you gonna buy that book?
This ain't no library.

37:40.663 --> 37:45.026
The Surfer's nuts to hang around!
He knows life on Earth has no meaning!

37:45.126 --> 37:49.155
It's chaos! It's out of control!
He's got a chance to break away!

37:49.255 --> 37:53.964
I mean, he's plugged into the galaxy!
He's got the power cosmic!

37:55.761 --> 37:58.679
Only a jerk would stay when he could go.

38:03.685 --> 38:06.176
Yeah, maybe you're right.

38:21.453 --> 38:23.944
The Silver Surfer sucks!

38:50.481 --> 38:53.054
Buenos dias, senorita.

38:53.859 --> 38:55.567
Oh, no!

38:57.112 --> 38:59.431
What are you doing here?

38:59.531 --> 39:02.976
Well, the Beverly Wilshire
was booked up so I came here.

39:03.076 --> 39:05.895
- There are plenty of other hotels.
- Not for me.

39:05.995 --> 39:09.115
I always stay at the Beverly Wilshire.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.610
You're really crazy.

39:12.710 --> 39:17.115
Come here. Come on. Hey, hey, hey!
You don't even say hello to me?

39:17.215 --> 39:20.418
Why can't I ever be alone
when I wanna be alone?

39:28.017 --> 39:31.848
Monica, did you fuck
your teacher last night?

39:34.147 --> 39:36.223
Did ya?

39:37.067 --> 39:41.314
- Come on. Tell me.
- Leave me alone! I'm thinking!

39:42.823 --> 39:45.942
Monica, you didn't come home last night.

39:49.287 --> 39:54.282
It is last night and I am home.
My home, not yours!

41:29.843 --> 41:32.333
Why are you looking at me?

41:34.138 --> 41:36.214
Just lookin'.

42:16.555 --> 42:20.292
Why are you so afraid
to sleep with me again?

42:20.392 --> 42:24.970
Because you scare me.
I don't know what you want from me.

42:26.565 --> 42:29.482
- Everything.
- That's too much.

42:31.485 --> 42:33.976
What do you want from me?

42:36.615 --> 42:39.101
I don't know.

42:39.201 --> 42:42.321
- Something.
- That's not enough.

42:45.875 --> 42:48.778
All or nothing with me, baby!

42:48.878 --> 42:53.199
God, I love it when you look afraid
and surprised at the same time!

42:53.299 --> 42:55.872
I just wanna climb inside of you!

43:16.112 --> 43:18.188
That feels good!

43:24.913 --> 43:29.041
Would it feel so good if some other guy
was touching you like this?

43:31.835 --> 43:36.490
You're like one of those girls who'll fuck
everybody except the guy who loves her.

43:36.590 --> 43:39.577
You're like
one of those rides at Disneyland.

43:39.677 --> 43:41.918
Wow! You make me dizzy!

43:43.472 --> 43:47.126
- Show me your tits.
- What? What for?

43:47.226 --> 43:50.045
- TarÃ©!
- What?

43:50.145 --> 43:55.769
TarÃ©. It means crazy,
disgusting person, jerk.

43:56.235 --> 43:59.105
TarÃ©? I'm a tarÃ©?

44:01.572 --> 44:06.649
Forget it. Show me your toes.
A woman's toes are very important.

44:10.081 --> 44:14.244
I'd love to know
what's behind that face of yours.

44:16.587 --> 44:20.965
I stare at you and stare at you
and I can't see anything.

44:21.634 --> 44:26.261
What do you wanna know?
I'm from Earth. I'm a person. I love you.

44:29.392 --> 44:32.096
That's not enough.

44:57.085 --> 44:59.837
- Jesse...
- What?

45:01.756 --> 45:04.408
Say something nice.

45:04.508 --> 45:08.043
- Like what?
- I don't know.

45:12.642 --> 45:15.133
I don't know either.

45:16.646 --> 45:18.714
All right. How's this?

45:18.814 --> 45:21.676
Your shoes were red, my suit was blue.

45:21.776 --> 45:25.145
You left me in Vegas,
but I'll always love you.

45:26.739 --> 45:28.815
That's nice, isn't it?

45:43.213 --> 45:45.668
Hello. Strand Auto Parts?

45:46.049 --> 45:48.255
Hello. Mr Birnbaum?

45:53.640 --> 45:56.760
Is he gonna be there this afternoon?

45:57.811 --> 46:00.977
Tell him... Tell him
I wanna come see him.

46:01.314 --> 46:03.389
Jack Burns.

46:04.191 --> 46:08.512
Yeah. I think Mario called.
Called him all about me from Vegas.

46:08.612 --> 46:12.558
I'm supposed to bring over
a little foreign job.

46:12.658 --> 46:14.734
Jack Burns.

46:15.494 --> 46:17.771
Right. This afternoon. Bye.

46:17.871 --> 46:20.357
A little foreign job?

46:20.457 --> 46:22.746
Not you, a car.

46:34.178 --> 46:37.512
- Monica, come out here.
- No!

46:56.909 --> 46:59.229
Is this your driver's licence?

46:59.329 --> 47:01.272
What?

47:01.372 --> 47:05.651
No, no. That's my brother's.
Mine's in the car.

47:05.751 --> 47:09.962
But the name here is Jack Burns.
How can he be your brother?

47:11.006 --> 47:13.923
Yeah, right, right. That...

47:15.302 --> 47:17.371
Well, he's not my real brother.

47:17.471 --> 47:24.220
You see, cos when... When I was born,
my mother was already divorced.

47:29.232 --> 47:32.980
- I doubt it.
- Me, too.

47:40.117 --> 47:42.608
You know William Faulkner?

47:43.079 --> 47:45.570
Who's he? Somebody you fucked?

47:46.457 --> 47:49.777
The most beautiful American writer.

47:49.877 --> 47:52.450
He wrote my favourite line.

47:53.089 --> 47:57.038
"Between grief and nothing,
I will take grief."

47:58.094 --> 48:00.162
This guy sounds like a lot of laughs.

48:00.262 --> 48:05.683
No! Seriously. Grief or nothing?
What would you choose?

48:08.478 --> 48:10.589
Nothing.

48:10.689 --> 48:13.689
Like I told you, baby.
All or nothing with me.

48:44.638 --> 48:47.458
If I was William Faulkner,

48:47.558 --> 48:50.678
would you let me touch you like this?

48:58.444 --> 49:00.353
No.

49:04.490 --> 49:06.559
Hello. This is Monica.

49:06.659 --> 49:12.273
I'm not here, but if you leave a message
and tell me your name and number,

49:12.373 --> 49:14.943
I will call you as soon as I come back.

49:15.043 --> 49:19.206
And don't forget to wait for
the beep sound. Thank you.

49:25.928 --> 49:31.500
Hello, Monica. Paul. I'm sorry
that Boudreaux ran off last night,

49:31.600 --> 49:37.089
but you can meet him this afternoon.
I got you a pass to the groundbreaking.

49:37.189 --> 49:39.883
So, great.

49:39.983 --> 49:43.303
I'll tell you.
You make keeping promises very easy.

49:43.403 --> 49:47.558
- Fuck you, Charlie!
- No, don't turn it off.

49:47.658 --> 49:50.185
It's in Venice on Main and Rose.

49:50.285 --> 49:55.065
Right. And you'll meet him. And the old
and the famous and everybody.

49:55.165 --> 49:57.952
This afternoon at three. Three o'clock.

49:59.670 --> 50:02.989
And one more thing.

50:03.089 --> 50:07.169
I enjoyed last night enormously.

50:08.135 --> 50:10.211
Ciao.

51:02.021 --> 51:05.466
The suspect has a criminal record
of car thefts and petty crimes

51:05.566 --> 51:08.135
in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and California.

51:08.235 --> 51:11.055
This is believed to be Lujack's
first murder charge.

51:11.155 --> 51:14.939
Police have issued
this 1975 photo of Lujack...

51:31.841 --> 51:34.130
Oh, my fucking Christ!

51:46.939 --> 51:50.468
...medium-length brown hair, age 28,

51:50.568 --> 51:53.555
with a small heart-shaped
tattoo on his chest.

51:53.655 --> 51:58.233
We'll be keeping you informed
on this story as it develops.

52:04.498 --> 52:06.989
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

52:08.460 --> 52:10.536
<i>I can't get out</i>

52:12.506 --> 52:15.075
<i>I'm caught in a trap!</i>

52:15.175 --> 52:19.079
- <i>We're caught in a trap...</i>
- <i>I can't walk out</i>

52:19.179 --> 52:21.670
<i>I'm caught in a trap</i>

52:22.641 --> 52:26.086
- <i>I can't walk out</i>
- <i>Because I love you too much...</i>

52:26.186 --> 52:29.935
<i>Because I love you too much, baby</i>

52:31.983 --> 52:35.511
- <i>Why can't you see</i>
- <i>Why can't you see</i>

52:35.611 --> 52:39.348
- <i>What you're doin' to me</i>
- Jesse?

52:39.448 --> 52:44.656
<i>When you don't believe a word I say</i>

52:48.833 --> 52:55.085
<i>We can't go on together
with suspicious minds</i>

52:56.674 --> 53:00.411
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

53:00.511 --> 53:04.915
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

53:05.015 --> 53:07.918
- You're crazy!
- So what?

53:08.018 --> 53:10.509
It's OK. I like it.

53:11.604 --> 53:14.309
<i>I can't walk out</i>

53:15.859 --> 53:21.280
<i>Because I love you too much, baby</i>

53:24.075 --> 53:27.195
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

53:28.246 --> 53:30.737
<i>I can't walk out</i>

53:32.458 --> 53:37.196
<i>Because I love you too much, baby</i>

53:37.296 --> 53:39.372
I'm late.

53:45.346 --> 53:49.509
Don't take a shower. I want us
to smell like we've been fuckin'.

54:12.956 --> 54:15.078
That one.

54:33.433 --> 54:36.220
- What's that?
- The Silver Surfer.

54:36.478 --> 54:39.548
Sky-rider of the spaceways.

54:39.648 --> 54:42.851
- Who is he?
- Who's he?

54:43.860 --> 54:47.598
He's a space-lost freak
lookin' for love.

54:47.698 --> 54:49.516
Love?

54:49.616 --> 54:53.448
Yeah. You see, he's got this problem
with his girlfriend.

54:53.996 --> 54:57.696
They're trapped
on two different galaxies.

54:59.584 --> 55:02.787
No kiddin', really.
I'll show you. Come here.

55:05.464 --> 55:09.083
See, he's gotta go away never to return.

55:10.636 --> 55:15.464
"Though infinity beckons,
I must leave behind my very heart."

55:16.225 --> 55:21.730
"Never has there been,
never will there be another such as you."

55:24.483 --> 55:27.470
"If leave you must,
then let us depart together!"

55:27.570 --> 55:31.153
"Say no more!
It cannot be! It can never be!"

55:31.407 --> 55:37.361
"Where soars the Silver Surfer,
there must he soar alone."

55:40.373 --> 55:42.609
It's sad.

55:42.709 --> 55:45.200
Why does he have to soar alone?

55:46.046 --> 55:50.408
It's a long story.
He never stops thinking about her.

55:50.508 --> 55:53.344
He doesn't forget. Listen to this.

55:54.554 --> 55:58.303
"I have seen the birth of planets
and the death of worlds."

55:58.725 --> 56:04.046
"I have seen galaxies crumble
and new suns aborning."

56:04.146 --> 56:09.567
"But in every star, in every sun,
I see her face!"

56:17.242 --> 56:19.816
Hey, what are you doin'?

56:20.704 --> 56:23.399
Trying to shut my eyes very tight,

56:23.499 --> 56:25.990
so everything goes black.

56:27.252 --> 56:30.372
But it never gets completely black.

56:34.008 --> 56:36.926
You know, you said I was afraid.

56:38.846 --> 56:40.922
It's true.

56:42.350 --> 56:46.087
I'm afraid because
I'd like you to love me.

56:46.187 --> 56:50.137
And then of... I don't know.

56:51.067 --> 56:53.772
I wish you wouldn't love me.

56:55.071 --> 56:58.191
You don't fit into my plan for my life.

57:02.786 --> 57:07.697
Well, you're just going to have
to change those plans, darlin'.

57:10.127 --> 57:12.618
Anyway, don't worry about it.

57:15.215 --> 57:18.827
I don't love you the way
you think I do, anyway.

57:18.927 --> 57:21.872
How do you love me?

57:21.972 --> 57:24.249
Not the way you think.

57:24.349 --> 57:26.835
You don't know what I think.

57:26.935 --> 57:29.011
Yes, I do.

57:30.689 --> 57:34.425
You don't know
what I'm thinking about now.

57:34.525 --> 57:36.601
Yes, I do.

57:38.529 --> 57:41.234
I might be pregnant, Jesse.

57:46.037 --> 57:49.986
- Did you see a doctor?
- Tomorrow.

58:02.883 --> 58:05.374
Yeah! Yeah!

58:06.344 --> 58:09.262
Yeah! A little muchacho for you and me!

58:13.351 --> 58:15.225
Maybe.

58:16.063 --> 58:18.351
It's not for sure.

58:29.743 --> 58:33.896
...1961 MGB Roadster. Colour pink.

58:33.996 --> 58:36.899
- How long's the car been here?
- We don't know yet.

58:36.999 --> 58:39.068
You don't know? Find out! Ask!

58:39.168 --> 58:42.196
There's three freeways nearby.
He could be long gone.

58:42.296 --> 58:46.839
Nah, he ain't gone. He's around here
somewhere. I can smell him!

58:50.179 --> 58:52.551
- No!
- Yes!

58:54.392 --> 58:56.468
- No!
- Yes!

59:23.253 --> 59:25.826
So many cars in your business.

59:27.090 --> 59:29.326
Hey, where's my favourite dress?

59:29.426 --> 59:33.007
Isn't a woman allowed
to change her mind?

59:51.905 --> 59:54.610
I feel so free with you.

01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:13.499
Come on.
Let's just go, sugar. Let's just go.

01:00:15.136 --> 01:00:19.086
Please, Jesse.
I can't be late for this meeting.

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:47.532
All right! Come on, baby!
Say it! Talk to me, baby! Say it!

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:51.375
Mexico!
Let's go to Mexico and have a baby!

01:00:52.255 --> 01:00:54.331
We'll see.

01:01:01.264 --> 01:01:05.641
Try to understand me, Jesse.
I have to think about the future.

01:01:06.352 --> 01:01:10.396
The future? Yeah. I heard about it.
Never seen it.

01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:15.177
- Sounds like bullshit to me.
- Stop calling what I wanna do bullshit!

01:01:15.277 --> 01:01:17.555
What you do is bullshit, too!

01:01:17.655 --> 01:01:20.572
Bullshit it is! The future's Mexico!

01:01:21.325 --> 01:01:23.531
Say it. MÃ©jico.

01:01:24.161 --> 01:01:27.198
MÃ©jico! MÃ©jico!

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.653
How long is this
hole-diggin' shindig gonna last?

01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:35.829
About an hour.

01:01:36.756 --> 01:01:40.285
There is a sidewalk cafÃ© down the way.
Why don't you meet me there?

01:01:40.385 --> 01:01:42.674
I'll be there, baby.

01:02:43.529 --> 01:02:47.527
Officer! I saw this man
drop that girl off over there.

01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:56.032
Morning, ma'am!

01:03:11.348 --> 01:03:13.424
Hello, Paul.

01:03:17.145 --> 01:03:21.807
Dr Boudreaux, meet Monica Poiccard.
This is the student I told you about.

01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:24.678
It's a great honour, Dr Boudreaux.

01:03:24.778 --> 01:03:28.932
Sir, she's the best candidate
for a fellowship I've ever seen.

01:03:29.032 --> 01:03:32.981
- To work with me? Why?
- Everybody says you're a genius.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:35.604
That's true. So?

01:03:35.704 --> 01:03:38.649
Well, I want to learn
to make buildings that last.

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:42.083
Don't be foolish. Nothing lasts.

01:03:46.298 --> 01:03:48.374
- Birnbaum?
- Yeah.

01:03:48.968 --> 01:03:50.711
Jack Burns.

01:03:52.638 --> 01:03:55.207
Oh, yes. Mr Burns.

01:03:55.307 --> 01:03:58.252
Yeah, I left a message for you
this morning. You get it?

01:03:58.352 --> 01:04:00.421
Yes, Mr Burns.

01:04:00.521 --> 01:04:03.011
Mario sent me.

01:04:03.857 --> 01:04:05.933
Yes, Mr Burns!

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:10.478
Move over here.
I wanna run it up to the office.

01:04:14.909 --> 01:04:18.907
- Did anybody call about me?
- Yes, they called, Mr Burns.

01:04:19.414 --> 01:04:22.651
They said you were gonna bring
a foreign job, not a T-bird.

01:04:22.751 --> 01:04:25.954
I know, I know.
That one didn't work out for me.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.548
- So? Nu?
- So what about this one?

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:35.663
It's a classic. Perfect paint job.

01:04:35.763 --> 01:04:39.297
One of a kind. Unique.
Cream puff. Cherry.

01:04:41.852 --> 01:04:44.058
- 1200.
- Deal.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.769
You got one problem.

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:53.523
I won't be able to give you
the money till next week.

01:04:55.866 --> 01:04:58.394
You fat fuck!

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:02.241
What about you, Mr Jack Burns?

01:05:04.874 --> 01:05:07.579
What time is it? Five o'clock yet?

01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:11.544
- I got ten after five.
- Where's the phone?

01:05:32.401 --> 01:05:36.861
Wait a minute.
Too many old prunes in this picture!

01:05:37.322 --> 01:05:39.850
We need some flowers.

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.769
- Monica, come with us.
- Me?

01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:46.565
- Great. Looks like you're in.
- OK! That's more like it!

01:05:46.665 --> 01:05:49.370
- Where?
- Next to the picture.

01:05:51.294 --> 01:05:54.740
Oh, this is better. Who is she?

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.544
- Look this way!
- Smile, honey!

01:06:01.221 --> 01:06:04.174
Big smile! Here we go! That's nice!

01:06:10.563 --> 01:06:12.423
- Know this punk?
- No!

01:06:12.523 --> 01:06:14.717
You were seen with him 20 minutes ago.

01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:18.482
He had his hand on your ass
and his tongue down your throat!

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:21.474
Come on. You wanna talk with me.

01:06:21.574 --> 01:06:24.769
- Hey, who are you?
- A cop looking for a cop-killer.

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:29.607
Stay out of it, junior.
Still wanna tell me you don't know him?

01:06:29.707 --> 01:06:32.411
No... I mean...

01:06:33.376 --> 01:06:36.279
- It's Jesse.
- Jesse what? Jesse Lujack?

01:06:36.379 --> 01:06:38.657
- Where is he now?
- I don't know!

01:06:38.757 --> 01:06:42.619
You don't know? Listen, listen. Listen!

01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:45.210
Don't F-U-C-K with the LAPD!

01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:51.169
Please! He's just a guy I've seen
four or five times!

01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:54.130
I met him in Las Vegas.
I don't know anything about him!

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:57.384
Ma'am, after he dropped you off,
where'd he go?

01:06:57.484 --> 01:07:00.303
I don't know, I tell you!

01:07:00.403 --> 01:07:02.893
She's lying. Book her!

01:07:05.949 --> 01:07:08.852
- What's the charge?
- Suspicion.

01:07:08.952 --> 01:07:11.397
He's going away.

01:07:11.497 --> 01:07:16.402
Today sometime. San Francisco.
He's going to San Francisco.

01:07:16.502 --> 01:07:20.948
He knows a man in San Francisco, a man
who owes him money, and Jesse's...

01:07:21.048 --> 01:07:23.753
- The name. What's the name?
- Lewis.

01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:31.265
Berrutti's gone? Yeah, of course
I'll meet him. Yeah... Garage, downtown.

01:07:32.767 --> 01:07:35.684
Yeah. Got it. 8.30.

01:07:53.121 --> 01:07:57.664
You're wasting your time.
I keep the moolah in the cooler.

01:08:00.169 --> 01:08:03.086
- Advance me 500.
- No.

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.659
50.

01:08:07.759 --> 01:08:09.551
No!

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:14.465
20.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:18.002
Read my lips...

01:08:18.103 --> 01:08:22.479
Read my lips, fat-ass!
I can sell this car to 50 other guys!

01:08:30.115 --> 01:08:35.108
- Hey, Pancho, where's the jumper?
- Don't ask me, man. Ask the boss.

01:08:37.997 --> 01:08:40.483
OK, Birnbaum. Don't fuck with me!

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:42.871
Why don't you take a walk, punk?

01:08:44.377 --> 01:08:49.799
- You stole my jumper, scumbag!
- What are you gonna do? Call the cops?

01:09:23.249 --> 01:09:25.325
OK! I can't breathe!

01:09:26.377 --> 01:09:29.711
It's in my shorts, OK?
It's in my shorts!

01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:33.295
The moolah's in the cooler!

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.014
This is for my taxi, you little tarÃ©!

01:09:43.602 --> 01:09:46.921
Hey, boss, what's goin' on?
Are you all right?

01:09:47.022 --> 01:09:51.684
Do I look all right, dickhead?
Get him! Get that fuck!

01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:01.535
Over there, you bean-head! That way!

01:10:25.643 --> 01:10:29.339
Just don't turn around.
No, sweetheart. Don't turn around.

01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:31.726
There's a cop...

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:47.697
- This guy killed a cop?
- I don't know.

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:52.870
- No, hey. You can tell me. Did he?
- I don't know.

01:10:54.588 --> 01:10:56.876
You're in love with him?

01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:01.078
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!

01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:05.969
Oh, Jesus Christ! What do you mean
you don't know? Are you young?

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:14.715
Look, do you know what you're doing?
Let's say he's around here.

01:11:14.815 --> 01:11:20.651
If he's here, you'll lead the cops to him.
Want every cop in the world here?

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:26.951
Wait! This is that crazy man from
the classroom? The lunatic that broke in?

01:11:27.995 --> 01:11:30.486
What is this? You're crazy!

01:11:45.053 --> 01:11:50.458
Monica, do you understand that you
can ruin your life with a guy like this?

01:11:50.558 --> 01:11:53.586
It's not like that. You don't know.

01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:56.972
- What?
- You don't know me.

01:11:58.191 --> 01:12:00.480
No, I guess I don't, I guess.

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:10.193
Listen, Paul. I wish I had time
to explain, but I have to go.

01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:13.160
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:18.951
Monica!

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:28.836
Monica, if you ever need
a place to hide out or anything.

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.444
What's going on?

01:13:49.965 --> 01:13:52.041
Monica!

01:13:54.845 --> 01:13:57.467
Ain't you happy to see me, sugar?

01:13:57.932 --> 01:13:59.792
You! Police!

01:13:59.892 --> 01:14:03.378
I see you! I'm talking to you!

01:14:03.478 --> 01:14:07.007
Don't try to pretend!
Why are you following me?

01:14:07.107 --> 01:14:11.567
Because you are looking
for a tremendous amount of trouble!

01:14:11.986 --> 01:14:13.722
I didn't do anything.

01:14:13.822 --> 01:14:17.726
Your boyfriend just killed a cop
and you know where he is.

01:14:17.826 --> 01:14:21.813
- So you might as well tell us.
- He's gone to San Francisco!

01:14:21.913 --> 01:14:24.232
- You gonna get deported?
- That's my girl!

01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:27.944
- I told you the truth! He's gone!
- Let me tell you the truth!

01:14:28.044 --> 01:14:32.207
You don't play ball with us,
you're on the next Concorde outta here!

01:14:37.052 --> 01:14:40.623
We're trying to help you,
but you gotta start helping us.

01:14:40.723 --> 01:14:44.043
We got a witness who saw you
with Lujack an hour ago.

01:14:44.143 --> 01:14:48.935
He must be around here somewhere.
When did you last see him?

01:14:50.983 --> 01:14:52.358
Jesus!

01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:55.478
Hey! You!

01:14:59.324 --> 01:15:01.483
You comin' or not?

01:15:04.746 --> 01:15:08.909
Mexico! Mexico! MÃ©jico!

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:20.912
- Hey, man! Watch it!
- Check your oil, man?

01:15:21.012 --> 01:15:24.540
Get the stuff out of the back window.
I can't see.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.472
The cop!
He's running to the telephone box!

01:15:40.238 --> 01:15:43.358
- What do we do now?
- Now we go get the money.

01:15:43.784 --> 01:15:47.062
Get rid of this heap.
Get a car that'll take us to the border.

01:15:47.162 --> 01:15:49.618
Mexico by sunrise, baby!

01:15:50.332 --> 01:15:52.408
By sunrise?

01:15:55.003 --> 01:15:57.155
- In Mexico...
- Yeah?

01:15:57.255 --> 01:16:00.200
- Is it hot?
- Yeah, it's hot!

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.043
Hot tamale!

01:16:06.097 --> 01:16:10.593
Can we live in a house of grass,
by the sea?

01:16:11.102 --> 01:16:15.349
Sounds good. You, me, the muchacho.

01:16:16.857 --> 01:16:21.012
Yeah. You, me, the baby.

01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:25.057
The grass house, the sea.

01:16:25.157 --> 01:16:27.268
You got it, darlin'. You got it.

01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:30.073
And there is nothing else.

01:16:30.204 --> 01:16:32.492
Everything else goes away.

01:16:34.165 --> 01:16:36.985
There ain't nothin' else. That's it.

01:16:37.085 --> 01:16:39.706
Love is the power supreme!

01:16:40.755 --> 01:16:43.460
That's the whole story, baby!

01:17:04.903 --> 01:17:07.276
Damn! Look at her dance!

01:17:10.617 --> 01:17:12.693
Hey, Berrutti!

01:17:13.078 --> 01:17:15.285
Ray, he's cool. He's cool.

01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:18.525
Maybe I should say "He's hot!"

01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:22.947
Maybe the word is lucky.
Is that the word, kid? Finally!

01:17:23.047 --> 01:17:26.581
The word is jinxed, my friend.
I'm in a jam.

01:17:27.634 --> 01:17:32.841
Hey, Stretch. Why don't you take
this little lady for a nice dance?

01:17:33.514 --> 01:17:35.959
- Come on, little lady.
- Have fun.

01:17:36.059 --> 01:17:38.795
What do you need, pal?
You need help at the border?

01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:43.466
- Clean cheque I gotta cash.
- Jerk gives you a cheque, huh?

01:17:43.566 --> 01:17:47.095
Well, this'll have to be
tomorrow morning.

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:51.442
- No, tonight. Now.
- I don't have enough cash tonight.

01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:55.436
Where'd you get those pants?
Disguising yourself as an asshole?

01:17:55.536 --> 01:17:58.982
How many times have I told you
that style counts?

01:17:59.082 --> 01:18:01.192
I'm gonna give you this jacket.

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:05.870
Put you in style. Make you feel
a lot better. Ain't that beautiful?

01:18:10.384 --> 01:18:13.338
What's that look on your face?

01:18:14.179 --> 01:18:17.133
- Love, I guess.
- Oh, what a drag!

01:18:18.475 --> 01:18:20.966
Listen, pal, got a place to stay?

01:18:21.269 --> 01:18:25.101
- Cops, cops. Which way out of here?
- Over there.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.847
- Cops, cops, cops.
- Do you know The Pines?

01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:35.808
- 8.30 in the morning. OK?
- You got it, pal.

01:18:35.908 --> 01:18:37.984
Just jump on. Here's all I got.

01:18:41.038 --> 01:18:44.358
- There's the girl!
- There's Lujack with her!

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:46.866
- Hold it! Police!
- Monica!

01:18:47.837 --> 01:18:50.328
Get 'em! Get 'em!

01:18:51.674 --> 01:18:55.007
The elevator!
They're going down in the elevator!

01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:59.427
I got 'em down here!
Come on, Lujack, we got you!

01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:04.137
Don't shoot! He's got the girl with him!

01:19:10.233 --> 01:19:13.020
Run! Run!

01:19:13.486 --> 01:19:16.723
<i>Take care of each other</i>

01:19:16.823 --> 01:19:19.279
<i>When love walks in the room</i>

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:22.782
<i>Everybody stand up</i>

01:19:23.663 --> 01:19:26.415
<i>Oh, it's good, good, good</i>

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.707
<i>Like Brigitte Bardot!</i>

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:41.497
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Faster, faster! He's right there!

01:19:41.597 --> 01:19:44.514
- Let me outta here! Come on!
- Shut up! Faster!

01:19:45.309 --> 01:19:48.559
Look at you -
steering a getaway car! Scared?

01:19:48.854 --> 01:19:50.923
Yeah.

01:19:51.023 --> 01:19:53.312
- But you like it, don't you?
- Yeah!

01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:57.904
Don't stop now! You got them!
Ram him! Ram him!

01:20:09.082 --> 01:20:11.158
Turn the goddamn wheel!

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.376
<i>Me and you</i>

01:20:21.886 --> 01:20:24.555
<i>Every night, every day</i>

01:20:26.808 --> 01:20:28.876
<i>We'll be together</i>

01:20:28.976 --> 01:20:31.183
<i>Always this way</i>

01:20:32.104 --> 01:20:34.559
<i>Your eyes are blue</i>

01:20:35.399 --> 01:20:38.316
<i>Like the heavens above</i>

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:42.145
<i>Talk to me, darlin'</i>

01:20:42.823 --> 01:20:45.824
<i>With a message of love</i>

01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:10.963
The cops! The cops!

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.813
Police officers! Freeze!

01:21:25.906 --> 01:21:28.232
<i>When love walks in the room</i>

01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:31.574
<i>Everybody stand up</i>

01:21:32.579 --> 01:21:35.284
<i>Oh, it's good, good, good</i>

01:21:58.646 --> 01:22:01.054
- What do you see?
- Nah.

01:22:02.608 --> 01:22:05.099
There's nothing down there.

01:22:24.421 --> 01:22:27.825
- Do you want onions?
- Sure.

01:22:27.925 --> 01:22:30.244
- Cost you a nickel more.
- Movie!

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:34.175
- Never mind the onions.
- Hold the onions.

01:22:35.223 --> 01:22:39.172
What a fool I was to think
we could buck Las Vegas.

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:42.188
We just ran into a bad streak,
that's all.

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:05.152
- Are we safe now?
- I think so.

01:23:05.252 --> 01:23:07.410
We have to stay here a while.

01:23:12.676 --> 01:23:15.996
We've still got a tankful of gas anyway.

01:23:16.096 --> 01:23:19.631
Bart, do you know
what I was talking about?

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.765
Now I know
why it's all or nothing with you.

01:23:25.564 --> 01:23:27.141
Having fun?

01:23:43.581 --> 01:23:46.275
What a joint. No more hot water.

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:48.861
Look at you.

01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:51.796
You're a knockout, kid!

01:23:53.299 --> 01:23:56.035
Bart, I want things.
A lot of things. Big things.

01:23:56.135 --> 01:23:58.804
I don't want to be afraid of life
or anything else.

01:23:59.263 --> 01:24:01.624
I told you I was no good...

01:24:01.724 --> 01:24:05.341
I don't wanna be afraid of life
or anything else.

01:24:07.604 --> 01:24:10.521
You don't have to be afraid of nothing.

01:24:31.002 --> 01:24:34.446
I'll hock my guns. That'll give us
enough dough to make a new start.

01:24:34.546 --> 01:24:38.242
There isn't enough money in those
guns for the kind of start I want.

01:24:38.342 --> 01:24:40.911
I want a guy with spirit and guts!

01:24:41.011 --> 01:24:44.380
A guy who can laugh at anything
or do anything.

01:24:44.807 --> 01:24:48.335
A guy that can kick over the traces
and win the world for me!

01:24:48.435 --> 01:24:50.926
I wanna make love to you!

01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:57.476
Monica, are you crazy?

01:24:58.654 --> 01:25:00.730
So what?

01:25:02.699 --> 01:25:04.905
So I like it!

01:25:05.493 --> 01:25:10.618
Come on, Bart. Let's finish it
the way we started it - on the level.

01:25:21.968 --> 01:25:24.459
Open your eyes.

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:48.899
See anything you like?

01:25:50.954 --> 01:25:54.232
- This one?
- The red one?

01:25:54.332 --> 01:25:56.242
Eldorado!

01:26:12.516 --> 01:26:16.337
- What is this place?
- This is where Berrutti'll meet us.

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:19.090
Call it The Pines.
You ever hear of Errol Flynn?

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:23.318
Famous crazy fucker and movie star.
This was his spread.

01:26:30.284 --> 01:26:34.020
- This is where we stay tonight?
- No, up at the top.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.663
Right by the pool.
Got the honeymoon suite with a view!

01:27:05.776 --> 01:27:08.887
- What does jinx mean?
- What?

01:27:08.987 --> 01:27:12.522
Your friend back there -
you told him you were jinxed.

01:27:15.035 --> 01:27:18.784
Jinxed means
you got the devil's blessing.

01:27:23.585 --> 01:27:25.661
Ever seen the devil?

01:27:35.179 --> 01:27:38.299
How much money
will you get from Berrutti?

01:27:39.809 --> 01:27:42.300
Enough for a while.

01:27:57.452 --> 01:28:01.189
What will we do in Mexico
when the money is finished?

01:28:01.289 --> 01:28:04.205
Get more! Keep goin'!

01:28:06.001 --> 01:28:08.492
Money's my middle name, baby!

01:28:10.088 --> 01:28:12.413
How do we get more?

01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:15.661
Become thieves?

01:28:15.761 --> 01:28:17.837
I don't know.

01:28:18.764 --> 01:28:21.708
What do you keep asking me
these questions for?

01:28:21.808 --> 01:28:26.004
About the future,
which I don't know, you don't know!

01:28:26.104 --> 01:28:29.853
Nobody knows it!
So fuck it, roll the dice!

01:29:28.248 --> 01:29:30.324
Jesse?

01:29:32.418 --> 01:29:35.321
- Jesse?
- What?

01:29:35.421 --> 01:29:37.912
I just wanted to say good morning.

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:40.917
So far so good.

01:29:55.607 --> 01:29:59.345
- What are you doing?
- Examining these plugs.

01:29:59.445 --> 01:30:04.022
The pimp that owned this thing
must have treated it like a piece of shit!

01:30:05.825 --> 01:30:08.742
- Jesse?
- What?

01:30:09.579 --> 01:30:12.273
Tell me you love me.

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:15.078
Yeah, sure I do, sugar.

01:30:25.428 --> 01:30:27.504
Damn it!

01:30:30.683 --> 01:30:33.600
Do me a favour, pumpkin.

01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:39.804
Go down and get us a carton of milk,
some Ding Dongs and a newspaper.

01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:42.819
Get yourself something, too.

01:30:44.112 --> 01:30:48.062
Gonna be your last American food
for a while, baby.

01:30:55.540 --> 01:31:00.535
Come on, honey. Don't be down.
We're just getting to the good part.

01:31:08.928 --> 01:31:11.679
Step on it.
Berrutti's gonna be here in 20 minutes.

01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:14.886
We gotta vamoose outta these parts.

01:31:21.732 --> 01:31:23.175
Jesse.

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:25.813
Shit! What?

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:31.530
Nothing. Just looking at you.

01:31:47.048 --> 01:31:49.618
I've seen you someplace before.

01:31:49.718 --> 01:31:50.869
What?

01:31:50.969 --> 01:31:55.332
- Are you on a TV show?
- No.

01:31:55.432 --> 01:31:59.377
On a quiz show, huh?
Let's Make a Deal, right?

01:31:59.477 --> 01:32:00.557
No.

01:32:01.479 --> 01:32:03.804
Thanks. I'll think of it.

01:32:30.507 --> 01:32:31.917
Oh, merde!

01:33:14.758 --> 01:33:18.708
Hey, hop in.
We'll meet Berrutti down by the gate.

01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:24.344
- Where's my newspaper?
- I can't go with you, Jesse.

01:33:27.979 --> 01:33:31.099
Not now, sugar. Come on. What's wrong?

01:33:33.192 --> 01:33:36.941
I called the police.
I told them you were here.

01:33:40.074 --> 01:33:42.779
What the fuck for?

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:49.411
- It don't make any sense!
- It makes sense!

01:33:55.673 --> 01:33:57.962
No, it doesn't.

01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:02.502
- Monica, you love me.
- I don't want to love you!

01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:06.051
I don't want to go with you!

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:12.935
Just now when I went down the hill,
I wanted to keep going on.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.722
I was not gonna come back.

01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:19.315
You love me. You say it!

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:22.647
I was not going to come back!

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:29.022
But I knew you would come after me

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:33.071
and I knew you wouldn't
stop coming after me!

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:38.989
- But you love me! Now say it!
- It doesn't matter if I...

01:34:39.089 --> 01:34:42.826
- Say it!
- It doesn't matter if I love you!

01:34:42.926 --> 01:34:44.995
It's wrong for us.

01:34:45.095 --> 01:34:48.132
You don't see,
but I can't stop you, Jesse.

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:52.795
You're damn right you can't stop me.

01:34:52.895 --> 01:34:57.299
That's why I called the police -
so that you would have to go!

01:34:57.399 --> 01:35:00.484
Go, Jesse, please! Quickly!

01:35:07.742 --> 01:35:09.818
All right.

01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:13.954
You say you don't love me. Then I'll go.

01:35:17.418 --> 01:35:21.167
You gotta say it. Say it and I'll go.

01:35:22.548 --> 01:35:25.253
It's easy. Go on. Say it.

01:35:26.094 --> 01:35:28.929
You can't say it, can you?

01:35:31.432 --> 01:35:33.507
I don't love you.

01:35:37.396 --> 01:35:39.851
You liar.

01:35:41.066 --> 01:35:44.186
- My little liar!
- Please, Jesse.

01:35:45.195 --> 01:35:47.069
My God! Berrutti!

01:35:49.157 --> 01:35:53.950
We can still make it, darlin'!
I know a hundred ways out of this town!

01:35:54.871 --> 01:35:57.160
I'll be right back!

01:36:00.377 --> 01:36:05.715
Berrutti! Get outta here quick!
The little French girl called the cops!

01:36:06.007 --> 01:36:08.743
- Get in the car, man!
- I can't leave her, Tony.

01:36:08.843 --> 01:36:13.289
Are you crazy, man? The broad
turned you in! You're gonna blow it all!

01:36:13.389 --> 01:36:16.509
You know me, Tony. All or nothin'.

01:36:18.352 --> 01:36:21.022
We got the money!

01:36:21.397 --> 01:36:23.716
It's all the way now, baby!

01:36:23.816 --> 01:36:27.019
Look, pal.
This is all I can do for you now.

01:36:29.405 --> 01:36:32.737
- Adios, amigo!
- You're whacked out of your skull!

01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:46.372
Jesse!

01:36:49.799 --> 01:36:51.626
Freeze!

01:36:52.844 --> 01:36:55.549
Don't do it! You'll be chopped meat!

01:36:59.267 --> 01:37:01.343
Put up your hands!

01:37:01.977 --> 01:37:04.053
Let's see your hands!

01:37:18.202 --> 01:37:21.105
<i>If you're gonna love me,
lover, please don't tease</i>

01:37:21.205 --> 01:37:23.899
<i>If I can hold you, honey, let me squeeze</i>

01:37:23.999 --> 01:37:26.694
<i>My head goes round and round</i>

01:37:26.794 --> 01:37:29.498
<i>And my love comes tumblin' down</i>

01:37:29.838 --> 01:37:31.249
No, Jesse!

01:37:38.262 --> 01:37:41.263
<i>You... you leave me</i>

01:37:45.853 --> 01:37:48.095
Jesse! I love you, Jesse!

01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:54.268
<i>Breathless!</i>

01:38:01.119 --> 01:38:03.979
<i>Now, if you love me, please don't tease</i>

01:38:04.079 --> 01:38:06.523
<i>If I can hold you, then let me squeeze</i>

01:38:06.623 --> 01:38:10.944
<i>My heart goes round and round,
my love comes tumblin' down</i>

01:38:11.044 --> 01:38:16.169
<i>You leave me... ah... breathless!</i>

01:38:18.343 --> 01:38:20.954
<i>Well, I shake all over and you know why</i>

01:38:21.054 --> 01:38:23.582
<i>I'm sure it's love and that ain't no lie</i>

01:38:23.682 --> 01:38:25.959
<i>Cos when you call my name</i>

01:38:26.059 --> 01:38:28.128
<i>You know I burn like wood inflamed</i>

01:38:28.228 --> 01:38:33.269
<i>You leave me... ah... breathless!</i>

01:38:34.317 --> 01:38:38.721
<i>Ooh, baby, you're driving me crazy</i>

01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.767
<i>You're much too much -
I cannot love you enough</i>

01:38:42.867 --> 01:38:44.936
<i>It's all right to hold me tight</i>

01:38:45.036 --> 01:38:50.024
<i>When you love me, love me right</i>

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:52.693
<i>Come on, baby, now don't be shy</i>

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.946
<i>Cos love was meant for you and I</i>

01:38:55.046 --> 01:38:57.323
<i>Wind, rain, sleet or snow</i>

01:38:57.423 --> 01:38:59.784
<i>I'm gonna get you wherever you go</i>

01:38:59.884 --> 01:39:04.960
<i>You leave me... ah... breathless!</i>

01:39:39.838 --> 01:39:44.216

01:39:44.343 --> 01:39:47.913
