02:49.086 --> 02:51.296
Here comes the tickle monster.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.299
Come on, it's time to get up.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.510
Good morning. Be
careful, please.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.182
Are you really gonna
go all by yourself?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.559
I still have to do it.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.435
But aren't you afraid?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.979
I'm gonna be okay.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.105
But what if you're
not back in time for-

03:08.105 --> 03:09.189
Good morning.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.858
How you feeling today, Mia?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.317
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.696
I was thinking of having
a birthday dinner for you.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.448
18. It's a big deal.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.120
I remember just yesterday

03:23.120 --> 03:26.123
you were a scruffy teenager
arriving at my house.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.124
Yeah.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.626
Well, thank you.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.712
But really, I don't
need anything.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.505
I really don't.
- Oh, come on.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.382
It's good for all the kids.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.342
You're gonna be an adult.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.343
Come on. It'll be nice.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.305
I think I'm gonna
run in to the library.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.556
Okay.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.807
There are some
books I wanna get.

03:43.807 --> 03:44.892
Well, get some

03:45.017 --> 03:46.143
for when you're at the
hospital too, okay?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.269
Yeah, sure.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.230
Hey, do you think I
could borrow some money

03:50.230 --> 03:53.525
for buses and, you know, snacks?

03:53.525 --> 03:54.985
- Okay.
- Pretty please.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.945
- Yes, yes, yes.
- You're the best.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.696
I know.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.992
Thank you. I'll be back
before lunch, Mrs. R.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.160
- Okay.
- Thank you. Mwah.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.870
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.956
So kids,
what are we gonna do today?

04:35.025 --> 04:37.110
Hey man,
it's been a while.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.781
Can you believe I've already
been home for three weeks?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.784
I'm so bored. Come over.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.744
You can't ignore me forever.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.756
Morning.
Cream or butter?

04:57.756 --> 04:59.049
Thanks, Mom, but.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.759
Right. Not hungry
today either.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.636
Hey, buddy.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.977
Ah, well, um, we talked
to Josh last night.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.646
Seems like he's doing
a little bit better.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.022
He asked us about you
again and we told him-

05:14.022 --> 05:15.691
Yeah, I know.

05:15.691 --> 05:16.984
I'm gonna go see him right now.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.278
Oh, I think he'll
appreciate that.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.863
Yeah.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.155
Have you responded to
the scholarship letter?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.617
Come on, Kyle, they are not
gonna hold your place forever.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.452
Well, then they should
give it to someone else.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.620
- No, this is not-
- Honey.

05:30.289 --> 05:34.668
Honey, you have the whole
summer before you have to go.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.503
Sign the entrance enrollment.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.796
Then see how you feel.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.883
I don't think I'll
be back for lunch.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.969
Hey, here, take this with you.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.054
Here you go.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.103
I don't know what to say.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.479
Why did you
have to say that again?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.482
He can't throw
away his soccer scholarship.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.776
He didn't go to
graduation, fine,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.695
but bailing on his scholarship?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.114
You've got
to give him more time.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.116
It's only been a few
months since the accident.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.534
He'll come around.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.952
I hope so.

you get lost or what?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.642
Said you're coming hours ago.

07:55.642 --> 08:00.355
Yeah, I- I walked.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.944
Hey, don't,
don't worry about it.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.949
I know it looks bad, but
it feels a lot worse.

08:15.621 --> 08:18.957
So, um, where've you been?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.425
First two editions
of "Sun Eater."

08:28.425 --> 08:30.761
Thanks, dude.

08:33.430 --> 08:33.972
You're the best.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.980
So have you talked to them yet?

08:43.607 --> 08:44.358
Noah's parents?

08:47.486 --> 08:48.987
They've called a bunch of times.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.782
They wanna talk to us.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.994
You still can't remember?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.580
You know, what
happened before the?

09:01.416 --> 09:02.000
Me neither.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.003
They say it's normal.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.301
I'm so sorry, boys,

09:11.301 --> 09:12.970
but the, um, physical
therapist called,

09:12.970 --> 09:15.472
he's gonna be here any
minute, so I think you should.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.767
Yeah, yeah, of course,
um.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.019
I- I'll come back later.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.068
We haven't summoned the
courage to tell him yet,

09:28.068 --> 09:32.030
but he may never walk again.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.411
It's a blessing that you didn't
get more hurt than you did.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.040
Just, just look at you.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.043
There's barely a scratch on you.

09:46.837 --> 09:51.049
And Josh, he's just broken.

09:52.885 --> 09:53.635
And Noah.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.474
Noah.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.645
There's not.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.065
There's not an
hour that goes by.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.360
Not an hour goes by that I wish

10:10.360 --> 10:12.070
he hadn't gotten into
that car with you.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.590
I wish he hadn't gotten
into that car with you.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.217
And Noah.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.593
Just look at you,
not a scratch on you.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.053
He hadn't gotten
into that car with.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.012
Not a scratch on you.

11:26.812 --> 11:31.525
Help!

11:36.864 --> 11:38.490
Hey! Can you hear me?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.123
Oh, oh, ow! Oh.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.251
Are you all right?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.335
You passed out.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.006
Are you feeling better?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.219
Get it off me, get it off me!

11:59.219 --> 12:00.012
Gross. Ooh.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.724
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.853
Oh, it's, I- I'm usually
not this hysterical.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.646
It's just that, um,
when I was a kid,

12:09.646 --> 12:11.273
a lizard crawled
into my bed once.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.399
And, you know, when
you're five years old,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.067
that could be
really traumatizing.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.195
People don't scream when
they're about to pass out.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.697
No?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.532
No.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.076
Okay, well, I'm epileptic
and so I can always tell

12:23.076 --> 12:24.661
when I'm about to faint.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.871
And because of that, I
scream because I get scared.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.122
Hold on, hold on a minute.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.081
I just, I think
that we should talk.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.042
Just mind your own business.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.668
No, no. Don't you get it?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.754
You are my business.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.631
If I let you do what I
think you are about to do,

12:35.631 --> 12:37.925
I will never be able
to forgive myself.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.552
And your mother would never
be able to forgive me either.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.220
Just go home.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.680
No.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.973
Fine.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.391
No. If you jump,
I'm gonna jump.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.980
What the? Hey, stop.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.486
Do you believe me now?

12:57.486 --> 12:59.071
Monkey see, monkey do.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.036
This has gotta be a nightmare.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.540
Just go away.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.916
Never.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.959
Ooh, it's unlocked.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.710
Gimme my phone back.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.253
Mm-mm.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.631
I'm gonna text myself
so I have your number.

13:19.550 --> 13:20.259
Who are you?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.554
My name's Amelia.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.681
Amelia Faith, but
you can call me Mia.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.021
Hi.
- Finally.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.481
I was getting worried.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.816
I'm so sorry. I just,

13:35.816 --> 13:38.277
I- I lost track of
time at the library.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.779
Mia, just be honest with me

13:40.779 --> 13:43.031
and you better not have
your fingers crossed

13:43.031 --> 13:43.907
behind your back.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.954
Maybe we should try
another counselor.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.331
No, come on, Lisa,
it has been months

13:51.331 --> 13:53.417
and he's getting
worse day after day.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.503
And he won't talk. He won't eat.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
I mean, he barely even
looks at us anymore.

14:00.799 --> 14:01.341
Hey.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.308
How'd it go with Josh?

14:33.665 --> 14:34.333
I knew it.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.101
Hey. If it isn't
my favorite foster sis.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.770
How's Mrs. Rothswell doing?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.438
She's good.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.857
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.151
Can you still do your
responsible mother voice?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.617
Hi, my name is Mia.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.868
I'm a really good
friend of Kyle's.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.286
- Oh.
- Him and I

15:11.286 --> 15:12.871
were having a
conversation the other day

15:12.871 --> 15:15.374
and he said that he's obviously
going through a hard time.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.042
- Right.
- And he really felt

15:17.042 --> 15:18.293
like he needed to get away.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.419
So I just thought that, um,

15:19.419 --> 15:20.796
it might make you feel better

15:20.796 --> 15:22.297
if you could speak to my mom.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.465
- Yeah.
- Dammit.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.258
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.218
Hi, Mrs. Faith.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.345
It's just such a surprise.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.430
Thank you very much, Mrs. Faith.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.266
We'll be sure to let him know.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.767
Such an amazing offer.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.814
Oh? Yeah, he's been going
through tough times.

15:38.814 --> 15:41.066
I. Ah-huh.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.192
Here he is now.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.528
Oh.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.115
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.032
Okay, bye.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.325
She is so chatty.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.496
Hey, so I was just
filling your parents in

15:54.496 --> 15:55.831
on what we talked
about yesterday.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.292
Uh?

15:58.292 --> 16:00.252
With you saying that
you needed to get away.

16:00.252 --> 16:03.881
And my mom inviting you to spend
some time with us in Spain.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.216
She's a photographer, a
really, really good one.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.676
And so she travels a lot

16:07.676 --> 16:09.761
and she's been there
for a week already

16:09.761 --> 16:11.346
and she says that we're
just gonna love it.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.307
She seems really nice.

16:13.307 --> 16:16.185
But Kyle, honey, why haven't
you ever told us about Mia?

16:18.353 --> 16:19.438
- Because I just-
- No, no.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.106
No, no.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.941
You're not gonna tell
them how we met, are you?

16:22.941 --> 16:26.028
That is so
embarrassing.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.531
Okay, so you're saying
that you wanna travel now?

16:29.531 --> 16:31.450
Mm-hmm, he said that
he would not miss it.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.369
Can I talk to Mia in private?

16:34.369 --> 16:35.412
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.418
What are you doing here?

16:41.418 --> 16:42.711
I'm trying to get
your parents on board

16:42.711 --> 16:43.962
for you to come to Spain.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.632
- Spain?
- Yes. Spain.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.759
The place between
France and Portugal.

16:48.759 --> 16:51.512
Come with me for 10
days. All expenses paid.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.096
Just get outta town
for a little while.

16:53.096 --> 16:53.847
Forget it.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.144
Okay, look, your
parents are very nice,

16:59.144 --> 17:01.647
but they also seem very
concerned for your wellbeing.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.817
I could tell them
how we actually met

17:05.817 --> 17:07.903
or you could come with me.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.613
And if you still wanna kick
the bucket after the trip,

17:09.613 --> 17:11.073
I won't stop you.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.741
Deal?

17:12.741 --> 17:16.370
Mom, Dad. Mia's leaving.

17:16.370 --> 17:18.038
Okay, look, no, you
can think about it.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.122
You don't have to decide now.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.249
You can just let me know tonight

17:20.249 --> 17:21.333
or, or maybe tomorrow.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.169
I'll be back.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.171
Well, it was really
nice to meet you guys.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.422
Thank you so much.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.715
My mom, she just
really wanted me

17:28.715 --> 17:30.259
to meet you guys in person.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.761
There are so many, you know,
crazy people out there.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.555
She just.
- Of course.

17:34.555 --> 17:35.556
It was a pleasure to meet you.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.974
Really nice meeting you.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.393
Um, hon, just to let you know,

17:39.393 --> 17:40.519
your, your shirt's
on inside out.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.145
Oh no, I do that on purpose.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.022
- Oh!
- Yeah.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.649
It makes me feel like I'm a
little bit less conventional,

17:45.649 --> 17:46.942
or, or something.
- Oh.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.569
Oh, wait. Hey, Kyle.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.153
Don't forget to text me a
picture of your passport

17:50.153 --> 17:51.196
and all that jazz.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.614
We leave in three days.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.199
I'm gonna kill you.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.701
Yay. Bye.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.625
Why do you think he never
said anything about her?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.210
She's lovely.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.712
He hasn't told us
anything in three months.

18:12.217 --> 18:12.968
Come in.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.054
Hey, buddy.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.598
Your mom and I just
finished reading this.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.558
We thought you might
get something out of it.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.229
Hey, you know what?

18:24.229 --> 18:25.856
I got an idea.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.192
What do you say that you
and I take a soccer ball,

18:28.192 --> 18:30.068
hit the field, you
can work on your PKs.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.904
I don't think you can
score on me today.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.155
No, I'm okay.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.575
Okay. Plan B.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.204
There is a big
FIFA match tonight.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.705
You, me, pizza.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.457
Watching it together
on the couch.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.583
Not tonight, okay?

18:54.009 --> 18:58.472
Son, I know what
you're going through

18:58.472 --> 19:00.807
is incredibly challenging,

19:02.267 --> 19:03.727
but you can't stay locked up

19:03.727 --> 19:06.563
in your room day
after day, hiding.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.524
Can we please not do this?

19:08.524 --> 19:09.691
No, we are.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.151
We're gonna do this right now.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.278
You've been pushing
us away for too long.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.613
Something has to change.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.909
Do you think that if
you get outta here

19:18.909 --> 19:20.911
and you go to Spain,
that that's gonna help?

19:20.911 --> 19:22.454
'Cause if you do,
I want you to go.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.830
No, I don't wanna go.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.082
You don't wanna go?

19:25.082 --> 19:26.667
You know what, what
do you wanna do?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.962
You wanna stay in here for
another three months, moping?

19:29.962 --> 19:31.088
What do you want from me?

19:31.088 --> 19:33.549
I want my son back.

19:33.549 --> 19:34.299
I want you.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.764
He's gone, Dad.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.016
What?

19:44.726 --> 19:47.062
Kyle.

19:54.069 --> 19:54.820
Here.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.243
Go find him.

20:15.090 --> 20:15.674
This is for you.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.555
Looks pretty. Like you.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.265
Do you really have to go?

20:24.725 --> 20:26.351
Yeah.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.687
This is my chance to
get some answers, Becca.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.148
I hope you can understand.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.069
Hey, come here.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.367
I have to tell you
something really important.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.578
My best friend once told me,

20:44.578 --> 20:45.621
no matter what happens,

20:45.621 --> 20:47.372
no matter where I am,

20:47.372 --> 20:50.167
there will always be
somebody somewhere

20:50.167 --> 20:51.710
who is glad you were born.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.506
Okay? So don't be sad.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.061
Why are you smiling?

21:09.061 --> 21:10.729
I just got some good
news about my trip.

21:13.649 --> 21:15.234
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.985
On behalf of the
captain and crew,

21:16.985 --> 21:18.862
we would like to
welcome you aboard.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.406
Our flight to Madrid,
Spain will 13 hours-

21:21.406 --> 21:22.824
I am so excited.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.285
I've been planning
this trip for years

21:25.285 --> 21:28.330
and I've been thinking
about it, well, forever.

21:30.582 --> 21:31.834
Have you ever had a dream

21:31.834 --> 21:33.043
and it finally comes true

21:33.043 --> 21:35.045
and then you just don't
know what to feel?

21:35.045 --> 21:37.422
That is exactly what
I'm feeling right now.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.298
Please take a moment

21:38.298 --> 21:40.175
to review the safety data card

21:40.175 --> 21:41.760
in the seat pocket
in front of you.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.931
Hey, hey, maybe we
ought to watch this.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.641
To
fasten your seatbelt,

21:47.641 --> 21:50.644
insert the metal fitting
one into the other,

21:50.644 --> 21:54.147
tighten by pulling the
loose ends of the straps.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.317
Should the cabin experience
any pressure loss

21:57.317 --> 22:00.904
stay calm and listen
for instructions
from your cabin crew.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.283
Oxygen masks will-
- Oh! Cool, thank you.

22:04.283 --> 22:07.035
Place the mask
over your mouth and nose.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.079
If you are traveling
with children, make sure

22:09.079 --> 22:11.957
your own mask is on first
before helping them.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.417
It's my first
time on an airplane.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.462
It's actually my first
time outside of California.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.715
Isn't that so exciting?

22:19.715 --> 22:22.050
I've always wondered what it
would be like on an airplane.

22:22.050 --> 22:25.554
How big up-ahead
storage would be?

22:25.554 --> 22:27.055
I thought it would be
smaller than this, actually.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.682
I was pleasantly surprised.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.316
Oh, here it is.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.026
Ah!

23:27.115 --> 23:30.327
So you're the girl who
booked the Tuc Tuc a year ago.

23:30.327 --> 23:31.620
Mm-hmm.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.538
You like to plan ahead.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.207
So I guess that's Noah?

23:37.209 --> 23:40.337
No. No, Noah couldn't make it.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.631
- Oh, okay.
- Ah. But this is Kyle.

23:42.631 --> 23:45.175
Kyle Thompson. Here is his info.

23:45.175 --> 23:49.346
Bueno, then if you can
give Noah his receipt,

23:49.346 --> 23:53.892
then I will just add Kyle
to the paperwork, and yes.

23:53.892 --> 23:54.893
Okay, this is for you.

23:55.978 --> 23:57.312
Let's go see the van.
- Okay.

24:03.569 --> 24:05.112
Here it is.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.989
Fully equipped,
exactly as advertised.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.740
You have a kitchen,
you have a stove,

24:08.740 --> 24:10.367
uh, the bed on the back,

24:10.367 --> 24:12.077
and you also have
Bluetooth connection,

24:12.077 --> 24:14.580
if you want to listen to
music while you drive,

24:14.580 --> 24:15.330
it'll be perfect.

24:16.832 --> 24:18.542
And I guess that's
pretty much it,

24:18.542 --> 24:21.795
so, uh, see you in 10 days.

24:21.795 --> 24:24.965
Oh, could you please take
care of her for me, okay?

24:24.965 --> 24:25.716
Mm-hmm.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.268
You must be crazy if you think

24:36.268 --> 24:37.352
that I'm getting in
this thing with you.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.687
Especially with you
behind the wheel.

24:38.687 --> 24:41.064
No, I don't know how to drive.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.795
And how awesome would it be

30:36.795 --> 30:38.881
if I got to meet my mom on
the day that I was born?

30:40.924 --> 30:44.219
Happy birthday, Mia.

30:44.219 --> 30:44.928
Thanks.

30:46.555 --> 30:48.974
So where does this
mom of yours live?

30:48.974 --> 30:50.350
Well, over the last two years

30:50.350 --> 30:52.060
I've been doing
a lot of research

30:52.060 --> 30:53.770
and I came up with
10 mother candidates.

30:55.022 --> 30:57.191
The first is in Segovia.

30:57.191 --> 30:59.568
Well, looks like you'll
meet her pretty soon then.

30:59.568 --> 31:02.362
We just passed a sign that
says six kilometers to Segovia.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.573
Six kilometers?

31:04.573 --> 31:07.159
No. No, why didn't
you say something?

31:07.159 --> 31:09.786
No, I can't meet
my mom like this.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.205
I brought my favorite
shirt for her.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.873
I- I have to change.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.792
I can't believe that this is
finally happening right now.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.377
I mean, the mom is here-
- Mia, curtain!

31:17.377 --> 31:18.921
Look, I'm sorry, I just,

31:18.921 --> 31:21.215
this is my favorite shirt and
I got it just to meet her.

31:21.215 --> 31:22.799
God, get yourself
together, Mia Faith.

31:22.799 --> 31:26.595
♪ Not in control of
our final destination ♪

31:26.595 --> 31:30.557
♪ We light up all
the places we go ♪

31:32.059 --> 31:35.229
It's getting a little
late, don't you think?

31:35.229 --> 31:37.064
I mean, we shouldn't
just be barging in

31:37.064 --> 31:39.900
on somebody unexpectedly
at this time.

31:42.236 --> 31:44.488
I mean, they could
be having dinner.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.448
Still pretty light out.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.824
Plus, I read they have
dinner pretty late.

31:49.660 --> 31:53.372
No, we just landed
today and I'm exhausted.

31:54.623 --> 31:57.084
You know, I booked us
a place for tonight.

31:57.084 --> 31:59.211
Maybe we could go
there and get some rest

32:00.838 --> 32:03.006
and then we can go
meet her tomorrow.

32:19.648 --> 32:21.400
Happy birthday, Mia.

33:36.934 --> 33:37.476
Kyle.

33:40.938 --> 33:42.147
Oh, come on.

33:42.147 --> 33:44.858
Don't tell me that
you like to sleep in.

33:50.614 --> 33:51.365
Kyle?

33:52.991 --> 33:53.534
Kyle?

33:58.413 --> 33:59.289
No. No, no.

34:12.803 --> 34:13.512
Come on.

34:16.390 --> 34:17.140
Pick up.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.774
What? Where were you?

34:25.774 --> 34:28.610
Oh, good morning to your too.

34:28.610 --> 34:29.945
I was taking a shower

34:29.945 --> 34:31.864
and on my way back I
got us some breakfast.

34:31.864 --> 34:33.407
And you just took
all your stuff with you

34:33.407 --> 34:34.283
to go take a shower?

34:35.242 --> 34:38.036
Oh, actually, yes.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.621
You were out cold

34:39.621 --> 34:41.039
and I didn't wanna be
grabbing stuff outta my bag,

34:41.039 --> 34:42.708
making noise.

34:42.708 --> 34:45.377
Oh, so you weren't
planning on leaving me

34:45.377 --> 34:46.545
and just taking off?

34:48.213 --> 34:50.340
Of course not.
Deal's a deal, right?

34:51.592 --> 34:53.260
Hey, watch the chocolate.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.011
Thank you.

34:57.222 --> 34:58.015
Thank you for staying.

35:09.193 --> 35:11.361
Ah! No, no, no.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.447
How did that happen?

35:13.447 --> 35:15.240
I spilled the hot chocolate.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.827
I'm such a klutz, I
spilled it everywhere.

35:18.827 --> 35:19.620
I'm so sorry.

35:20.787 --> 35:21.914
What am I supposed to do?

35:23.332 --> 35:25.167
I can't show up to
meet my mom like this.

35:30.881 --> 35:31.590
Oh man.

35:33.550 --> 35:34.843
I can't believe this happened.

35:34.843 --> 35:36.261
It's just this is
my favorite shirt

35:36.261 --> 35:37.763
and I really wanted to wear it.

35:37.763 --> 35:39.473
Hang on. I
think I got an idea.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.940
Why you stopping?

35:47.940 --> 35:50.484
Come on. We gotta get
you some new clothes.

35:50.484 --> 35:51.818
No, I'm fine, really,

35:51.818 --> 35:53.654
I'll figure something out.

35:53.654 --> 35:55.322
"I'll figure something out."

35:55.322 --> 35:57.074
I'm not lending you my clothes.

35:57.074 --> 35:57.616
I can't.

35:59.076 --> 36:01.161
Really, I'm on a very
tight budget this trip.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.163
Well, consider it a
belated birthday gift.

36:04.498 --> 36:06.667
No. No, I can't accept it.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.043
Of course you can.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.545
Plus, my dad gave
me his credit card

36:09.545 --> 36:11.296
and if he sees I'm not
spending any money out here,

36:11.296 --> 36:13.632
then I dunno, he'll call
the embassy or something.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.134
No.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.803
Okay, fine. Whatever.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.052
You're crazy. Did you
buy the entire store?

37:40.052 --> 37:41.386
You need clothes.

37:41.386 --> 37:42.513
I couldn't made up my mind.

37:45.098 --> 37:46.892
Okay, but I'm paying
you back every penny.

37:48.727 --> 37:49.478
Thank you.

38:07.371 --> 38:08.497
You're not wearing
your clothes inside out.

38:08.497 --> 38:10.123
What for? They're new.

38:13.377 --> 38:14.920
What's this?

38:14.920 --> 38:16.588
Yeah, yeah, I know
you can't accept it,

38:16.588 --> 38:17.798
but it's my birthday
gift to you.

38:19.216 --> 38:19.758
Happy birthday.

38:21.468 --> 38:23.220
Oh! Thank you.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.021
What do you think?

38:33.021 --> 38:34.523
Too big. Let's go
get you new ones.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.900
No. No, I love them.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.069
I've never had any before.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.238
Ray-Bans? It doesn't get
more classic than that.

38:41.238 --> 38:42.990
No. Sunglasses.

38:45.868 --> 38:46.618
Vamos?

38:47.911 --> 38:49.413
Vamos.

39:55.437 --> 39:56.480
Okay, one down.

39:58.315 --> 40:00.609
Which means we're one
mother closer. Right?

40:03.779 --> 40:05.822
It's still pretty early.

40:05.822 --> 40:06.740
Got a lot of rounds to make.

40:06.740 --> 40:07.658

42:31.051 --> 42:35.305
Ah, my mom asked for pictures.

42:35.305 --> 42:37.766
I just thought she'd liked
the street, that it's pretty.

42:37.766 --> 42:41.103
Oh, and here I thought
you wanted to immortalize me

42:41.103 --> 42:43.647
in one of your drawings and
needed my picture as a model.

42:45.065 --> 42:45.774
Silly me.

42:52.865 --> 42:55.492
Oh!

42:55.492 --> 42:58.620
Oh. Wow.

43:00.664 --> 43:02.332
Nice moves.

43:02.332 --> 43:03.917
Too bad those kids
aren't scouts.

43:03.917 --> 43:06.003
You could get a scholarship.

43:06.003 --> 43:09.173
I had a scholarship but I
didn't sign the paperwork.

43:09.173 --> 43:09.882
Why not?

43:11.466 --> 43:12.885
Got tricked to going
into Spain with some girl

43:12.885 --> 43:14.052
trying to meet her mom.

43:16.305 --> 43:18.056
Let's get a nice lunch on me.

43:25.731 --> 43:26.899
What are those?

43:26.899 --> 43:27.524
Just my vitamins.

43:28.734 --> 43:30.360
Hm. You know what I don't get?

43:30.360 --> 43:31.904
Hmm?

43:31.904 --> 43:33.780
How the heck you were planning
on making this trip work

43:33.780 --> 43:35.824
if you don't know how to drive?

43:35.824 --> 43:38.160
My best friend was
supposed to come.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.953
He really wanted to
help me find my mom,

43:39.953 --> 43:41.413
but he couldn't make it.

43:41.413 --> 43:42.998
And you still have to tell me

43:42.998 --> 43:46.710
how you came up with this hit
list of mother candidates.

43:48.545 --> 43:51.340
Okay, so my former foster
brother turned hacker

43:51.340 --> 43:53.008
helped me look into it.

43:53.008 --> 43:56.136
She's from Spain and she was
a former exchange student

43:56.136 --> 43:57.763
in California.

43:57.763 --> 43:59.765
You know, he actually
helped me find this.

44:03.769 --> 44:06.021
So what, you just like
searched up every woman

44:06.021 --> 44:07.105
with this name in Spain?

44:08.315 --> 44:10.108
Yeah. And the States too.

44:11.818 --> 44:13.946
Fortunately there weren't many
women with that last name.

44:13.946 --> 44:15.239
That, and then Spanish women,

44:15.239 --> 44:18.033
they actually never
lose their maiden names.

44:18.033 --> 44:21.370
I just got really fed up with
all the unanswered questions.

44:21.370 --> 44:22.120
Who was she?

44:23.163 --> 44:24.122
What happened to her?

44:25.207 --> 44:26.124
What's her family like?

44:27.918 --> 44:29.169
What's my family like?

44:32.422 --> 44:34.299
This is the only
thing I have of hers.

44:37.386 --> 44:39.137
That's really pretty.

44:39.137 --> 44:39.888
Yeah.

44:41.849 --> 44:46.478
And at least you have
like foster siblings, right?

44:46.478 --> 44:50.190
24. I moved around a lot.

44:51.775 --> 44:54.653
12 different homes in my
18 years in the system.

44:54.653 --> 44:56.405
That's a lot of homes.

44:56.405 --> 44:59.825
Yeah, but none of
them are real homes.

44:59.825 --> 45:00.492
Not like yours.

45:02.452 --> 45:04.997
I've officially aged out
of the system now anyway.

45:04.997 --> 45:06.999
But Mrs. Rothswell did say
that I could stay with her

45:06.999 --> 45:08.500
until I go to college.

45:10.043 --> 45:11.170
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

45:13.172 --> 45:14.381
Oh, what are you doing?

45:14.381 --> 45:15.632
I said I was gonna pay.

45:15.632 --> 45:17.259
I just wanna see
how much I owe you.

45:17.259 --> 45:18.302
No. My treat means you
don't have to pay for it.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.803
I know that's what
it means. I just-

45:19.803 --> 45:20.846
Oh, sorry.

45:20.846 --> 45:22.181
Um. No, it's okay.

45:31.231 --> 45:31.982
Kyle!

45:37.154 --> 45:38.655
Noah Green is your friend

45:38.655 --> 45:40.490
that was supposed
to come on this trip

45:40.490 --> 45:42.242
and you didn't think to
mention that fact to me?

45:42.242 --> 45:43.619
What is this? Some
kind of sick joke?

45:43.619 --> 45:48.290
No. No, he was my best friend.

45:48.290 --> 45:50.250
He set this whole trip up.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.585
And you choose to bring me.

45:52.836 --> 45:53.587
The reason he's gone.

45:55.422 --> 45:57.299
What do you want from me?

45:57.299 --> 45:59.051
I don't know.

45:59.051 --> 46:00.344
I recognized you at the park

46:00.344 --> 46:02.304
and when I saw
you about to jump,

46:02.304 --> 46:07.017
I- I thought that
I could help you.

46:08.519 --> 46:09.978
I thought that maybe we
could help each other.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.813
Kyle, I am so sorry.

46:38.674 --> 46:40.259
We met in photography class

46:41.969 --> 46:43.011
a few summers ago.

46:46.348 --> 46:48.642
We just hit it off instantly.

46:51.353 --> 46:52.729
He bought the plane tickets.

46:54.147 --> 46:55.274
He helped me save my money.

46:57.526 --> 46:58.610
He even found the van.

47:07.119 --> 47:09.246
We were in the, uh, the
same grade growing up.

47:11.957 --> 47:15.460
I remember playing freeze tag.

47:18.755 --> 47:21.633
And in first grade we were
on the same soccer team,

47:21.633 --> 47:24.761
but, um, he stopped playing.

47:29.683 --> 47:32.311
And then, uh, we, we'd see
each other in the halls

47:34.229 --> 47:39.193
and, and nod, and that was it.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.155
I wish I had known him better.

47:45.616 --> 47:48.243
He was a one of a kind human.

48:00.672 --> 48:03.634
This says that the sand
dunes are unmissable

48:03.634 --> 48:05.677
and that there's gonna be
a meteor shower tonight.

48:38.252 --> 48:40.629
English?

48:40.629 --> 48:41.505
American?

48:41.505 --> 48:43.382
Si, American.

48:45.342 --> 48:46.802
License and registration.

48:46.802 --> 48:51.515
Oh yes. Yes.

48:57.688 --> 48:59.147
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

49:01.108 --> 49:02.401
You were driving too slow.

49:03.735 --> 49:04.570
Too slow.

49:06.613 --> 49:10.242
First time, warning.
Second time, fine.

49:10.242 --> 49:11.702
- Okay.
- Okay?

49:11.702 --> 49:12.536
Okay, okay.

49:16.498 --> 49:17.249
Ola.

49:25.299 --> 49:27.968
You have to be the
only person under 80

49:27.968 --> 49:31.430

too slow.

49:32.890 --> 49:35.434
Let's go, gramps. Vamos!

50:01.251 --> 50:02.461
Can you smell it?

50:04.421 --> 50:05.881
I've died and gone to Venus.

50:08.675 --> 50:10.177
You're certainly
from out of this world,

50:10.177 --> 50:12.554
so makes a lot of sense.

50:12.554 --> 50:14.932
Let's
get in the water.

50:14.932 --> 50:17.518
Are you nuts? In your clothes?

50:17.518 --> 50:20.437
Oh, come on! Come

What's your favorite
place in the universe?

52:02.247 --> 52:03.373
Mine is Venus.

52:05.459 --> 52:07.252
I wish I could just
think about being there

52:07.252 --> 52:09.713
and boom, I'm there.

52:13.217 --> 52:14.801
What's your deal with Venus?

52:14.801 --> 52:15.761
Why you like it so much?

52:18.096 --> 52:22.434
On my Venus, there's no war,

52:25.270 --> 52:28.440
no pain or hunger.

52:30.859 --> 52:32.945
On my Venus there aren't parents

52:32.945 --> 52:36.865
who don't love their
children, or even.

52:39.952 --> 52:40.619
Death?

52:41.954 --> 52:43.622
Death isn't such
a scary thing, Kyle.

52:49.962 --> 52:51.171
You know when you're dead

52:53.340 --> 52:54.633
you can't laugh anymore,

52:56.635 --> 52:58.679
or hang out with your friends,

52:58.679 --> 53:02.474
or fall in love,

53:02.474 --> 53:05.644
or eat a hamburger.

53:09.982 --> 53:10.649
Death sucks.

53:11.984 --> 53:12.860
It was an accident.

53:53.650 --> 53:54.693
I lost control of the car.

53:58.238 --> 53:58.780
It was me.

54:02.993 --> 54:04.703
I was the one that
was behind the wheel.

54:06.413 --> 54:09.041
And I wasn't even supposed
to be driving Josh's car.

54:09.041 --> 54:13.712
Kyle, Noah would not
wanna see you like this.

54:14.379 --> 54:15.172
I don't know that.

54:18.133 --> 54:19.051
And you can't ask him.

54:21.845 --> 54:23.514
And it's not even just Noah.

54:24.431 --> 54:25.516
My friend Josh,

54:26.975 --> 54:28.519
I don't know if he'll
ever walk again.

54:31.146 --> 54:32.523
Who can live with that? Not me.

54:37.444 --> 54:39.154
Kyle, there has to be a reason

54:39.154 --> 54:42.199
that you made it out okay
when the others didn't.

54:42.199 --> 54:43.742
This world, it can
be really harsh

54:45.577 --> 54:46.912
and really bad
things can happen,

54:49.206 --> 54:52.376
but you cannot give up
because you made a mistake.

54:52.376 --> 54:53.919
You've been given
a second chance

54:53.919 --> 54:56.380
to make a difference
in this world.

54:56.380 --> 54:58.006
It's all in how you look at it.

54:58.006 --> 55:00.217
I could be really upset
that my mom left me.

55:00.217 --> 55:03.178
Or I could just be happy
that she even had me.

55:06.014 --> 55:06.974
I wish I never existed.

55:11.270 --> 55:11.854
Hey.

55:14.022 --> 55:15.148
Noah used to tell me,

55:16.650 --> 55:19.528
"There will always
be somebody somewhere

55:21.029 --> 55:22.364
who is happy that
you were born."

55:48.473 --> 55:50.142
Kyle?

55:51.268 --> 55:52.019
Mia!

55:59.443 --> 56:01.320
Hey! Hey, it's been two hours.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.654
When on Earth are you
gonna tell me something?

56:15.042 --> 56:16.335
Uh, are you with Amelia Faith?

56:16.335 --> 56:17.503
Yeah. Is she okay?

56:17.503 --> 56:18.754
Yes. Yes, don't worry.

56:18.754 --> 56:20.672
It happens with people
in her condition.

56:20.672 --> 56:21.798
We are discharging her now.

56:21.798 --> 56:23.634
Wait, wait, what condition?

56:23.634 --> 56:25.677
Oh, I thought.

56:25.677 --> 56:28.222
Well, in that case it's better
if she tells you herself.

56:31.767 --> 56:33.393
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

56:40.025 --> 56:42.402
What condition was that
doctor talking about, Mia?

56:42.402 --> 56:44.571
I'm fine. Just
forgot to take my pill.

56:44.571 --> 56:46.365
Yeah, your vitamins.

56:46.365 --> 56:48.700
When are you gonna tell me
what's actually going on?

56:48.700 --> 56:51.203
Okay, what's going on

56:51.203 --> 56:52.829
is that I have a
genetic heart defect.

56:54.081 --> 56:55.874
There. Boom.

56:58.168 --> 57:00.295
So it's fine. I'm releasing
you from our agreement.

57:02.047 --> 57:03.924
No, no, I'm, I'm not
gonna just up and leave you.

57:03.924 --> 57:05.175
We had a deal, right?

57:05.175 --> 57:07.886
It's fine. I'm
used to it by now.

57:07.886 --> 57:08.679
No, Mia!

57:09.972 --> 57:12.516
You have an awesome chauffeur

57:14.059 --> 57:16.687
for the next couple
of days, so come on.

57:30.576 --> 57:31.743
Mrs. Rothswell?

57:34.371 --> 57:36.498
There's something
I have to tell you.

58:12.367 --> 58:15.454
Okay. Who are you avoiding?

58:15.454 --> 58:16.163
My foster mom.

58:17.706 --> 58:19.583
Why?

58:19.583 --> 58:21.502
I kind of ran away.

58:21.502 --> 58:23.504
In that I didn't tell
her where I was going.

58:24.630 --> 58:25.172
Why not?

58:26.673 --> 58:28.509
Because Mrs. Rothswell
wanted me to stay home

58:28.509 --> 58:29.301
and have the surgery.

58:31.428 --> 58:32.971
Wait, hold on. What surgery?

58:35.224 --> 58:37.309
I had an operation
scheduled for this week.

58:43.273 --> 58:45.108
You decided to travel
to Spain instead?

58:46.818 --> 58:48.987
My doctor said it was
perfectly safe for me to travel.

58:51.281 --> 58:53.408
And what's the point of
waiting my entire life

58:53.408 --> 58:55.452
just to die on an
operating table

58:55.452 --> 58:57.246
before I get to meet my mom?

58:57.246 --> 58:58.747
How dangerous is the surgery?

59:00.499 --> 59:04.002
Half of the people die,
but half of them live.

59:12.469 --> 59:15.013
Are you, uh, are you scared?

59:16.974 --> 59:18.600
Death has never
really scared me.

59:20.853 --> 59:22.771
Then what are you
afraid of, Mia Faith?

59:25.732 --> 59:28.026
I guess what I'm afraid
of is dying invisible.

59:29.862 --> 59:33.198
If you don't make a
difference in somebody's life,

59:33.198 --> 59:35.117
if you don't even try
to change the world,

59:35.117 --> 59:37.494
then what's the point
of ever being born?

59:37.494 --> 59:38.078
Of ever living?

59:40.080 --> 59:42.875
- Hence your Photolog.
- Yeah, I guess.

59:43.917 --> 59:46.253
Okay, so how many views?

59:46.253 --> 59:47.880
No idea.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.715
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

59:49.715 --> 59:50.757
Gimme your phone.

59:53.093 --> 59:53.844
Okay.

59:58.390 --> 01:00:00.225
Hm, oh. No wonder here.

01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:03.061
Your account was on private.

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:06.940
Why didn't you tell
me about your heart?

01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:10.068
I guess I just,

01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:13.155
I wanted to see what
it would feel like

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:15.616

I got a better idea.

01:04:38.212 --> 01:04:39.213
Let me check

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:40.380
if there are any
available rooms.

01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:45.219
Mia, look.

01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:49.389
It's beautiful.

01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:53.268
You are in luck. We
just had a cancellation.

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:55.145
It's a room with
a king size bed.

01:04:59.816 --> 01:05:00.359
Okay.

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:03.695
Whoa!

01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:09.368
Kyle,
this is crazy nice.

01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:13.539
Wow. It's so beautiful.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.460
This room is amazing!

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.504
This is so cool.

01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:22.798
This is bigger than
my whole house.

01:05:22.798 --> 01:05:25.008
This is so nice.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:27.219
What's up here?

01:05:27.219 --> 01:05:29.888
Oh my God.

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:32.099
It has
a claw-foot tub.

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:33.267
I love claw-foot tu.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:36.645
Oh, and a nice cozy robe.

01:05:36.645 --> 01:05:39.231
Oh, that's so nice.

01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:42.109
Hey, do you mind if I
take a bath before dinner?

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.360
No, of course not.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.820
I'll go call my parents
and get us a table.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.571
Okay.

01:05:57.124 --> 01:05:58.834
Hi, Mrs. Rothswell.

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:02.421
I know, I know.

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.424
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

01:06:07.134 --> 01:06:09.553
Yeah, Yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:15.893
No. No, I- I haven't
found her yet.

01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:20.814
Yeah. Yeah, it's still ticking.

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:12.241
Sorry, I dozed off.

01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:14.451
All too much excitement
for one day, I guess.

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:16.995
Nice dress by the way.

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:17.746
Thank you.

01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:22.084
I- I- I wasn't sure
what you wanted, so.

01:07:24.962 --> 01:07:26.588
Thanks.

01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:29.758
So, uh, listen, uh,
before we go home tomorrow,

01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:32.135
maybe we could do
some site-seeing,

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.512
go to a nice restaurant-
- Home?

01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:37.474
No, I can't go home. I
have to keep looking.

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:41.770
For what? I mean, we found
all the names on the list.

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.398
Yeah, yeah, but maybe I
made a mistake or something.

01:07:44.398 --> 01:07:45.524
You can't be serious?

01:07:47.192 --> 01:07:50.362
Mia, listen, you
have to go home.

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:52.739
You need this operation.
This isn't some kinda game.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:54.408
I know, but I have
to keep looking.

01:07:54.408 --> 01:07:56.243
You can't keep putting
your life on the line

01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:57.202
looking for someone who,

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:00.539
who might not wanna be found.

01:08:02.624 --> 01:08:03.917
You've done your best, Mia.

01:08:06.128 --> 01:08:07.129
I'm sorry.

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:11.175
I know. You're right.

01:08:13.844 --> 01:08:15.846
But I just wanna
look her in the eyes

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:19.433
and I wanna ask her
why she didn't keep me.

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:22.311
Ask her how she
could just abandon me

01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.146
and act like I
never even existed.

01:08:24.146 --> 01:08:27.232
Well, maybe she did it
because it was best for you.

01:08:27.232 --> 01:08:28.817
Maybe she thought that
you were better off

01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:29.568
with someone else.

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:32.237
You don't understand.

01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:34.698
No, you don't understand.

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:38.702
You know, maybe if you stopped
obsessing over some woman

01:08:38.702 --> 01:08:41.330
who did nothing but
give birth to you,

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.789
you'd actually start
turning your attention

01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:44.583
to the people who
really care about you.

01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:52.174
Kyle.

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.299
I might be wrong, but I
need to see this through.

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:37.469
Just gimme three days
and if I don't find her,

01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:39.012
I will go home and
have the surgery.

01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:41.306
I promise.

01:09:48.105 --> 01:09:49.648
Three days, Mia. No more.

01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:57.281
And if anything goes wrong.

01:09:57.281 --> 01:09:58.031
Hey.

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:02.452
If anything goes wrong,

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:06.498
I'll see you on Venus.

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:09.353
Good morning.

01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.064
Morning.

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.690
Sorry, I didn't
hear you get up.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.317
Oh no, I didn't
wanna wake you up.

01:11:15.317 --> 01:11:17.319
Hey, so I've been thinking
a lot about your mother.

01:11:19.404 --> 01:11:21.615
And Mia, look at
your mom's signature.

01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:22.824
What does it say?

01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:25.077
It says Maria Astilleros.

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:28.622
Or what if it said
Maria Ostilleros?

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.751
Look, what if the A
was actually like an O

01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:33.794
and they just mistyped it?

01:11:35.879 --> 01:11:38.382
Oh, then I want you
to look at this.

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:42.344
Open it.

01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:50.227
It's the same as my necklace.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:52.020
It's from that small town.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.773
And I looked it up and there's
a lot of Maria Ostilleros',

01:11:56.233 --> 01:11:58.277
but there's only one
that lives near there.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:01.196
Oh my God.

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:03.615
And I just found an address.

01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:12.833
You know, we still have
two more hours to go.

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:13.792
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.255
If I see anything really
interesting, I'll wake you up.

01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:19.882
All right?

01:12:41.737 --> 01:12:43.697
Hey, you gotta see this.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.659
Hey. Hey, Mia.

01:12:47.659 --> 01:12:50.037
Mia. Mia?

01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:50.954
Hey, Mia? Mia!

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.132
Can I please get an
update on Amelia Faith?

01:13:02.132 --> 01:13:04.301
Excuse me? Are
you Amelia's friend?

01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:05.260
Yeah. Is she okay?

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.929
She's stable for now.

01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:10.015
However, her heart is very weak.

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:14.937
I understand she's scared
of undergoing the surgery,

01:13:14.937 --> 01:13:17.481
but if she doesn't, she'll die.

01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:27.741
How, how long do you
think she can hold out for?

01:13:27.741 --> 01:13:29.535
She's supposed to get the
surgery when we get home.

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.370
She could last
a month, a week.

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:32.955
We just don't know.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:35.207
But definitely she can't
fly in her condition.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:36.875
Can I see her?

01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:40.420
I need you to convince her
to let us do the surgery.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.549
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.

01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:44.925
Could you
take her ID to the nurse

01:13:44.925 --> 01:13:46.510
so they can fill
out the paperwork?

01:13:47.386 --> 01:13:48.929
Yeah.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:11.577
Kyle? Please,
you have to help me.

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:15.873
Why is your
ticket only one-way?

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:22.087
You never intended on having
that surgery, did you?

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:25.299
What was your plan, exactly?

01:14:27.426 --> 01:14:30.012
You just keep going
until you find her?

01:14:30.012 --> 01:14:32.139
Waste away until
you do. If you do.

01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:35.017
No. Kyle.

01:14:35.017 --> 01:14:37.311
No. Tell me it isn't true.

01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:41.940
Please tell me you're
gonna have that surgery.

01:14:47.613 --> 01:14:48.363
Dammit, Mia.

01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:52.534
You'd rather just give up
than risk what, exactly?

01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:54.912
Having someone love you?

01:14:56.288 --> 01:14:57.789
Or loving someone yourself?

01:14:58.749 --> 01:14:59.958
You don't understand.

01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:03.504
My heart has an expiration date.

01:15:03.504 --> 01:15:04.755
Then explain that to me.

01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:10.010
I don't want them
to open my heart

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:11.720
until I get to meet my mom.

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:20.229
What about me? What about us?

01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:23.398
That is not fair.

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:26.985
I shouldn't have to
choose one of you.

01:15:28.862 --> 01:15:30.280
I- I can't do this.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.615
Kyle!

01:16:00.644 --> 01:16:02.563
Help! Help, help!

01:16:10.654 --> 01:16:11.864
Bro, check this.

01:16:11.864 --> 01:16:14.324
Bro, chill, I'm driving.

01:16:14.324 --> 01:16:15.701
Funniest
things I've seen in-

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:16.910
I'm being serious.

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.287
- Just look at it.
- No, chill.

01:16:18.287 --> 01:16:21.290
Oh!

01:16:44.688 --> 01:16:45.439
Hey.

01:16:46.857 --> 01:16:48.025
It's all coming back.

01:16:54.198 --> 01:16:57.201
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:16:58.994 --> 01:17:02.497
I couldn't bring myself to
tell you, but it was me.

01:17:02.497 --> 01:17:04.625
It was my phone.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.085
I was totally wasted and
I showed you that video.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.465
And, and I looked at it.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.469
And, and I tried to get
around that motorcycle.

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:19.890
It was an accident.

01:17:23.519 --> 01:17:28.232
So you just gotta learn from it.

01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:32.110
And, and forgive yourself.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.950
I'm sorry, Kyle.

01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:42.120
Yeah, me too, Josh.

01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:07.145
Mia!
- Kyle.

01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:10.983
I'm so sorry.

01:18:10.983 --> 01:18:12.276
I'm sorry too.

01:18:12.276 --> 01:18:13.986
I can't even begin to imagine.

01:18:16.154 --> 01:18:18.949
But I wanna be by your side,

01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:24.413
and I don't care if, if it's
for an hour or, or for years.

01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:27.124
It don't matter. As
long as I'm with you.

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:33.297
I'm gonna take you
to meet your mom.

01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:35.174
Really? (sobs) Aw.

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.635
I just need a couple of hours.

01:18:38.635 --> 01:18:40.387
But I need you to
promise me something.

01:18:43.807 --> 01:18:45.642
I need you to promise
me that you'll fight.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:48.020
That we'll, we'll come back

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.938
and you'll have the operation

01:18:49.938 --> 01:18:50.981
and you'll do everything you can

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:52.733
to get through this for us.

01:19:04.286 --> 01:19:07.372
Okay. (laughs) Okay.

01:19:10.292 --> 01:19:11.210
Thank you.

01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:13.795
I love you.

01:19:15.881 --> 01:19:17.174
I love you too.

01:22:02.172 --> 01:22:02.965
- Ola?
- Hi.

01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:05.968
Hi. Can I help you?

01:22:07.928 --> 01:22:12.057
Yeah, I came all the
way from the United States

01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.392
because I'm looking for my mom

01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:17.396
and I was wondering if
maybe you recognize this.

01:22:28.282 --> 01:22:30.659
Ola, Mama.

01:22:30.659 --> 01:22:34.496
Amelia.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:59.229
Right, one more thing,
then we'll head back.

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:19.458
It's amazing.

01:23:23.003 --> 01:23:24.379
If things didn't
work out with your mom,

01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:25.464
this was my backup plan.

01:24:07.589 --> 01:24:10.384
I waited for that
moment for so long

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:13.512
and I had so many questions,

01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:19.309
but when I got to that door
today, none of it mattered.

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.523
All I could think about was you.

01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:32.531

special once told me

01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:58.570
there will always be
somebody somewhere

01:27:58.570 --> 01:27:59.863
who is happy that you were born.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.748
Well, this is it.

01:28:10.999 --> 01:28:14.378
Oh! Please, uh,
be careful driving.

01:28:14.378 --> 01:28:16.004
Are you sure it's safe?

01:28:16.004 --> 01:28:17.923
Yes, it's not like this
is my first road trip, Mom.

01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:20.175
I am proud of you son.

01:28:24.888 --> 01:28:26.265
You take care of yourself.

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.015
Yeah.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:31.019
Okay. Get outta here.

01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:32.938
You only got two weeks
to get to Boston, so.

01:28:55.252 --> 01:28:56.879
You sure you can
drive this thing?

01:28:56.879 --> 01:28:57.963
It's harder than it looks.

01:29:00.716 --> 01:29:02.593
I had a pretty good teacher.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:16.481
♪ There's something about
her hand holding mine ♪

01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:18.734
♪ It's a feeling that's fine

01:29:18.734 --> 01:29:22.279
♪ And I just gotta say

01:29:22.279 --> 01:29:25.282

a magical spell ♪

01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:27.576
♪ And it's working so well

01:29:27.576 --> 01:29:29.203
♪ That I can't get

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:30.871
I thought my trip
to Spain was about my past,

01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:33.373
but it was really
about my future.

01:29:33.373 --> 01:29:36.043
To find someone who
makes my heart so full

01:29:36.043 --> 01:29:38.837
that it could burst,
but in a good way.

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.716
I've always looked
at Venus as a place,

01:29:42.716 --> 01:29:45.761
but it turns out my
Venus was a person

01:29:45.761 --> 01:29:47.721
and not the person I
thought it would be.

01:29:47.721 --> 01:29:49.473
One who made life
worth fighting for.

01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:51.725
No. Put your hands
on the steering wheel.

01:29:51.725 --> 01:29:53.977
Okay. This right here.

01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:56.396
This is what it must
be like on Venus.

01:29:58.357 --> 01:30:01.652
♪ It keeps growing
every place she's been ♪

01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:06.615
