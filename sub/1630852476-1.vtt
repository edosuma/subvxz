00:01.377 --> 00:05.421
Gordon:<i> Every great chef</i>
<i> started at the bottom</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:08.007
<i> and worked in the toughest</i>
<i> kitchens to level up.</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:11.010
<i> So for the first time</i>
<i> in 12 years,</i>

00:11.053 --> 00:14.054
<i> I've created a brand new</i>
<i> cooking competition.</i>

00:14.098 --> 00:17.224
- Oh, my god.
<i> - ♪ rise up </i>

00:17.268 --> 00:20.352
gordon:<i> In a culinary</i>
<i> proving ground like</i>
<i> you've never seen before.</i>

00:20.396 --> 00:24.064
This is the most challenging
culinary gauntlet ever created.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.357
Come on.
Next level, I told you.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.986
<i> Because any chef can shine</i>
<i> in the best of circumstances.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.488
This is truly a chef's kitchen.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.159
Gordon: Those cooking on
the top level will get the first
pick of ingredients.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.910
Truffle, baby.
Truffle everything.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.748
Gordon:
<i> But only a next level chef</i>
<i> can make magic in the worst.</i>

00:40.791 --> 00:44.543
If you're down in the basement,
you'll have to make do
with what's ever left.

00:44.587 --> 00:47.880
What is potted meat?
I wouldn't touch this.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.298
Gordon:
<i> I'll put my reputation</i>
<i> on the line...</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:53.177
- Let's go!
-<i> As I go head-to-head</i>
<i> with two other stars</i>

00:53.179 --> 00:56.388
<i> in the world of cooking--</i>
<i> chef nyesha arrington...</i>

00:56.432 --> 00:59.475
All right, guys,
do not put me in the position
to send anyone home today.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.268
Gordon:
<i> ...And chef richard blais.</i>

01:01.312 --> 01:04.521
My reputation
is on the line as well.
I do not want to lose.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.066
Gordon:
<i>They are just as hungry as I am</i>

01:07.109 --> 01:09.943
<i> to prove that they can find</i>
<i> the next great talent.</i>

01:09.987 --> 01:12.654
Everybody I've mentored
in this competition is
going into elimination.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.573
This is ( bleep ).

01:14.617 --> 01:16.700
Gordon:
<i> The three of us</i>
<i> have scoured the country</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:19.745
<i> and handpicked 15 of</i>
<i>the\ most promising home cooks,</i>

01:19.789 --> 01:23.123
<i> social media chefs,</i>
<i> and talented professionals.</i>

01:23.167 --> 01:25.125
<i> And tonight, it's the draft.</i>

01:25.169 --> 01:29.254
- Come on, guys.
-<i> Each of us have one chance</i>
<i> to pick five chefs</i>

01:29.298 --> 01:32.466
<i> that we think can take it</i>
<i> to the next level.</i>

01:32.510 --> 01:36.178
Would you like to swap teams?
Give me an answer.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.262
-<i> Some will rise... </i>
- You're on fire.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.639
Gordon:
<i> Some will crash and burn.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:39.890
( bleep )

01:40.226 --> 01:42.434
gordon:
<i> But only one can claw</i>
<i> their way to the top.</i>

01:42.469 --> 01:43.227
<i> This is...</i>

01:43.270 --> 01:44.978
This is a redemption story.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.314
Gordon:<i> ...The evolution</i>
<i> of cooking competitions.</i>

01:47.316 --> 01:49.525
This is not next level cooking.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.592
Oh, my god.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.010
So good to see you all.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.012
- Whoa.
- Oh, my gosh.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.389
It's a party.

02:20.432 --> 02:24.101
I don't get starstruck.
I'm starstruck three times over.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.980
Welcome to "next level chef."

02:28.023 --> 02:29.523
I promise you all

02:29.567 --> 02:33.902
this will be unlike anything
you've ever seen or done before.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.530
So I guess the only question
is right now

02:36.574 --> 02:39.032
are you ready to be
the next level chef?

02:39.034 --> 02:41.827
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, chef!

02:41.829 --> 02:44.413
Now, joining me to take you
through this incredible journey

02:44.456 --> 02:48.167
are two extraordinary chefs.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.169
Chef nyesha arrington,

02:50.212 --> 02:53.755
celebrated restaurateur
and entrepreneur

02:53.799 --> 02:57.092
whose innovative recipes
are featured in publications
across the world.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.845
And chef richard blais,

02:59.889 --> 03:03.974
a trendsetting chef
with multiple restaurants
across the country

03:04.018 --> 03:07.978
and a james beard
nominated cookbook.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.023
You 15 have got extremely
different backgrounds,

03:11.066 --> 03:15.694
but you have been handpicked
out of thousands
for the same reason.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.029
We think you've got the skill,

03:17.072 --> 03:19.323
and maybe most importantly,
the drive

03:19.366 --> 03:22.284
to take your dreams
to the next level.

03:22.328 --> 03:23.285
Yes?

03:23.329 --> 03:25.037
- All: Yes!
- All right, yes.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.122
I said you'd be tested
as never before

03:27.166 --> 03:31.084
and a big part of that is
because of our unique kitchens.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.421
- We don't have one.
- What?

03:34.465 --> 03:38.008
We don't have two kitchens.
We have three of them.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.011
All stacked
on top of each other.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.222
If martha stewart
saw those kitchens,

03:43.265 --> 03:44.932
she would ( bleep ) herself.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.059
No way.

03:47.102 --> 03:51.855
Now, listen, on the top level
it's a state of the art
culinary workspace.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.234
Every modern gadget
you could ever dream of

03:55.277 --> 03:56.902
is up there on the top level.

03:56.946 --> 04:00.155
Now in the middle,
it's a standard
commercial grade kitchen.

04:00.199 --> 04:04.284
Everything you need
to make a decent meal.
Nothing more, nothing less.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.329
And there's the basement.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.582
It's a kitchen that will
definitely test you.

04:10.626 --> 04:15.128
I'd call it bare bones,
but that would be nice.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.507
Gordon:
Each challenge, the ingredients
are first come, first serve,

04:18.550 --> 04:22.177
all delivered
by our groundbreaking
next level platform.

04:22.212 --> 04:25.097
Those who start cooking
on the top level

04:25.140 --> 04:27.182
will get the first pick
of ingredients.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.184
If you're in the middle
on the second level,

04:29.228 --> 04:31.687
that will become
the second choice ingredients.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.022
And if you're down
in the basement,

04:34.066 --> 04:36.942
and trust me,
we've all been there before...

04:36.944 --> 04:40.070
You'll have to make do
with whatever's left
on those ingredients.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.281
That all starts tonight.

04:42.283 --> 04:46.326
You'll be cooking one
extraordinary next level dish.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.161
And based on what we taste,

04:48.205 --> 04:51.581
nyesha, richard, and I
will each choose five of you

04:51.625 --> 04:54.293
to mentor across
this incredible competition.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.796
And make no mistake,
we're gonna push you,

04:57.840 --> 05:01.425
because each of us
are so competitive,
and we want to say,

05:01.427 --> 05:04.386
"my team has
the next level chef."

05:04.430 --> 05:07.139
any of these three coaches
would be incredible,

05:07.141 --> 05:09.474
<i> but chef ramsay,</i>
<i> he's hard to impress,</i>

05:09.518 --> 05:12.728
so to be picked by him
would be pretty validating.

05:12.771 --> 05:18.317
And in the end,
the best chef will win a quarter
of a million dollars

05:18.360 --> 05:22.904
and a year of mentorship
from the three of us.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.365
- What?
- What?

05:25.409 --> 05:29.244
Having access to this wealth
of knowledge

05:29.246 --> 05:30.912
<i> would be amazing.</i>

05:30.956 --> 05:33.999
I have a young son,
and I wanna leave something
behind for him,

05:34.043 --> 05:36.001
but I also want
to accomplish my dreams,

05:36.045 --> 05:38.128
and this is a dream of mine.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.005
Now are you ready
to get started?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.048
All: Yes, chef.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.133
Let's find out what levels
you'll be cooking on.

05:43.177 --> 05:47.054
Let's start with one, two,
three, four, five of you

05:47.097 --> 05:49.473
head over to the elevator,
pick up a keycard,

05:49.475 --> 05:52.017
and that will determine
what floor you're cooking on.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.269
Choose wisely, and good luck.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.363
- Good luck!
- Whoo!

06:05.949 --> 06:07.282
- ( overlapping chatter )
- ( bleep )

06:07.576 --> 06:11.661
- level three, level three.
- Keep it going.
Up, up, up, up.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.873
Please go up!
Please go up!

06:14.917 --> 06:19.628
- This is crazy.
- Ah! Wait, okay. Okay.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.130
- Okay.
- I don't know.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.132
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Okay.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.509
- ( screaming )
- hey!

06:25.552 --> 06:27.594
- Okay, I can live with this.
- All right.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.139
- Not bad. Not bad.
- Okay.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.258
This is chill though.
This is chill.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.144
<i> The kitchen looks like</i>
<i> the middle floor,</i>

06:36.188 --> 06:38.355
<i> and immediately feel</i>
<i> very comfortable.</i>

06:38.357 --> 06:39.356
I'm so ready.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.609
I really want to be
on chef arrington's team.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.737
<i> She is a powerhouse</i>
<i> in the food industry,</i>

06:45.781 --> 06:47.989
<i> and so I'm hoping that there</i>
<i> are some ingredients</i>

06:48.033 --> 06:50.325
<i> that will allow me</i>
<i> to be able to create</i>

06:50.369 --> 06:52.285
<i> a delicious dish for her.</i>

06:52.329 --> 06:54.663
Yo, I'm not trying to be down
there in that never.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.458
- Right here. Right here.
- We got this.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.423
- Whoo!
- ( overlapping chatter )

07:04.466 --> 07:05.632
oh, my gosh.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.680
- Come on.
- Dude, this literally
is a basement.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.014
<i> Oh, my god.</i>

07:13.016 --> 07:15.016
<i> I was expecting</i>
<i> oscar the grouch</i>

07:15.060 --> 07:16.184
<i> to start popping out</i>
<i> of the trash cans.</i>

07:16.228 --> 07:18.812
Like, it was brutal.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.272
Do we have any blenders?

07:20.691 --> 07:23.275
I'm looking around
this basement kitchen,
and I don't really see anything.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.318
<i> There's no blenders,</i>
<i> there's no food processors.</i>

07:25.362 --> 07:28.655
<i> I see one tiny little sieve,</i>
<i> a little hand whisk.</i>

07:28.699 --> 07:32.325
I'm supposed to create
a next level dish in this dump?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.578
<i> There's no way chef ramsay's</i>
<i> going to pick me.</i>

07:38.792 --> 07:41.209
- Oh.
- Oh, my god.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.461
That was a long trip.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.133
- Yes!
- Oh, my god!

07:49.928 --> 07:53.472
- Oh, my god. Oh, my gosh.
- Top level, baby.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.184
- This is nice.
- Hello, fancy water.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.478
I'm seeing, like,
high end appliances, a range.

07:59.521 --> 08:04.524
Six different areas,
six different ranges? Stovetops?

08:04.526 --> 08:08.069
Burners!
That's the word I'm looking for.
My home chef is showing.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.198
Oh, these knives are so sharp.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.662
Hey, this knife
is dull as can be.
Did you guys feel it?

08:17.706 --> 08:18.955
It's like a butter knife.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.333
- The bottom is a mindset.
- Yeah.

08:21.376 --> 08:26.421
We're physically
at the lower level,
but mentally we're at the top.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.632
Lunch is ready.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.550
<i> I'm courtney</i>
<i> from atlanta, georgia.</i>

08:30.594 --> 08:32.344
<i> I'm 48 and a home chef.</i>

08:32.387 --> 08:33.553
I have a cookie business now

08:33.597 --> 08:36.473
where I ship cookies
anywhere in the world.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.225
<i> I've never been</i>
<i> to culinary school,</i>

08:38.268 --> 08:40.435
<i> but I'm as passionate as ever</i>
<i> about cooking.</i>

08:40.479 --> 08:43.063
I really wanna be
on chef blais' team

08:43.065 --> 08:48.026
<i> because I need stern</i>
<i> but still compassionate</i>
<i> in-your-face advice.</i>

08:48.070 --> 08:52.364
That will definitely catapult me
to another level

08:52.407 --> 08:56.159
that I've not been able
to achieve thus far.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.333
Nyesha:<i> Gordon, richard, and I</i>
<i> are dividing and conquering</i>
<i> in the kitchens</i>

09:03.377 --> 09:05.085
<i> to keep an eye</i>
<i> on the chefs today.</i>

09:05.128 --> 09:06.461
I think with
the proper mentorship,

09:06.505 --> 09:08.380
anyone can win
this competition.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.131
<i> This is exactly</i>
<i> what I'm here for,</i>

09:10.175 --> 09:11.883
<i> but what these chefs</i>
<i> don't realize</i>

09:11.927 --> 09:14.010
is I'm a badass in the kitchen

09:14.054 --> 09:15.220
and I ain't taking ( bleep )
from no one,

09:15.264 --> 09:17.055
<i> including gordon and richard.</i>

09:17.099 --> 09:18.598
Come on. Let's go.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.562
Oh, my god.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.771
Stand by.
That platform's coming down.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.983
Get the smirks off your faces.
I'm not ( bleep ) around.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.026
You may be cooking
with one of us today,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.320
but that doesn't mean
you'll be on our team.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.863
You have to impress all of us.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.240
All: Yes, chef.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.451
- Who is it?
- All right, chefs, let's go.
Are we ready to go?

09:38.495 --> 09:39.744
- All right, chef.
- Just get organized.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.039
Of course, it's a draft,
and I'm picking people
that inspire me.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.002
I want flavors.
Flavor win championships.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.128
This is the real deal.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.338
<i> I wanna beat gordon ramsay.</i>

09:50.382 --> 09:52.716
<i> Nyesha arrington, she's one</i>
<i> of the best in the biz.</i>

09:52.759 --> 09:55.885
In about two minutes,
your life is about
to start changing, right?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.054
So I'm looking for people
that bring heat,

09:58.089 --> 10:00.181
spice, acidity, sweet, sour,

10:00.225 --> 10:01.891
that bring everything
to one plate.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.603
Oh, somebody's in there.
Somebody's in there.
Somebody's in there.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.148
- Ah!
- Yeah!

10:08.150 --> 10:11.067
I hope each and every one of you

10:11.111 --> 10:12.902
are ready to freaking bring it.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.154
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, yes.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.905
Check your ovens.
Check your gas.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.198
The platform is on its way.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.659
Bring your a-game.
Everybody touching
the elevator. Let's go.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.744
- All right.
- Yes, chef!

10:21.079 --> 10:23.455
- As soon as you see
the light turn green.
- Okay.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.373
When you get over there
to the platform,

10:25.417 --> 10:27.709
- you've only got 30 seconds
to grab those ingredients.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:27.753 --> 10:32.005
It's your one and only time
to grab ingredients,
so choose them wisely.

10:32.049 --> 10:36.217
Now, platform is moving.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.596
- Oh, wow.
- That is beautiful.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.057
30 seconds. Let's go!

10:42.100 --> 10:44.225
Ah, I can't run very fast!

10:44.269 --> 10:46.019
Nyesha: Grab your ingredients!
Grab what you need!

10:46.063 --> 10:48.021
Need a filet.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.356
- Are there radishes over there?
- Nyesha: Time's running out.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.565
- Yes.
- Heard, chef.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.485
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I don't
remember who I am anymore.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.404
The platform grab
is way more aggressive

10:56.448 --> 10:58.156
than I actually thought
it would be.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.158
Whoa. Duck breast.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.284
I see a duck breast, grab it.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.870
Nyesha: Six, five, four...

11:03.872 --> 11:08.083
<i> I have my mind set</i>
<i> on some kind of potato purée.</i>

11:09.002 --> 11:10.418
Nyesha: One.
Time's up.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.880
30 seconds gone.
Platform's gone.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.092
- Aw!
- Oh, sheesh.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.219
- All right, chefs,
when you see it turn green...
- Oh, it's cute!

11:19.262 --> 11:22.347
- Aah!
- Go! 30 seconds.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.598
Oh, my god.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.642
You need a bunch of ingredients.
Grab everything that you can.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.601
Are you kidding me?

11:26.895 --> 11:29.104
Richard: Make some decisions.
Grab some items.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.523
- Chorizo.
- Oh, my god. I don't know!

11:31.566 --> 11:35.110
I panic, and I'm starting
to grab the first things I see

11:35.153 --> 11:39.364
<i> rather than really look</i>
<i> and evaluate everything</i>
<i> that I have in front of me.</i>

11:39.366 --> 11:40.657
Corn.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.866
Richard: Three, two, one...

11:41.910 --> 11:43.284
- Garlic.
- Garlic.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.994
Ae:
<i> If you are in that situation,</i>

11:45.038 --> 11:47.497
that 30 seconds is five seconds,
honey buns.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.333
All right.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.129
- Stand by.
- Oh, my god.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.339
And let's go! Go, go, go!
Come on!

11:58.135 --> 11:59.676
Grab, grab, grab.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.345
Chicken tenders.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.347
So I see cauliflower,
grab that cauliflower.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.557
<i> I see some corn.</i>
<i> I know I can work with corn.</i>

12:05.892 --> 12:08.351
I see a bell pepper. All right,
let's grab a bell pepper.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.686
I don't see any proteins
on there.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.271
Gordon: Let's go.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.356
One protein each.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.315
Three, two...

12:14.359 --> 12:16.151
- Oh, just potted meat.
- ...One.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.944
Let's go! Go, go, go!

12:17.988 --> 12:18.987
Come on! Let's go!

12:19.030 --> 12:20.238
Grab!

12:20.574 --> 12:23.199
Roice:<i> The platform goes up,</i>
<i> and that's when I realize</i>

12:23.243 --> 12:27.662
the proteins were at the top.
I just didn't see them.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.832
Chef, I forgot a protein.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.375
Dude.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.253
Then you have to make the best
( bleep ) vegetarian dish
you've ever made.

12:35.297 --> 12:38.089
There's no way he's going
to pick me to be on his team.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.382
No one's going to pick me.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.057
- Chef.
- Yeah?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.601
- I forgot a protein.
- Dude.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.522
How could you not grab protein?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.024
Oh, my god.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.276
<i> My worst nightmare</i>
<i> is coming true right now.</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:02.113
<i> I forgot the protein in front</i>
<i> of my childhood idol.</i>

13:02.157 --> 13:05.033
You have to make the
best ( bleep ) vegetarian dish
you've ever made.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.410
- Done deal, chef.
- Don't ever make
that mistake again.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.621
45 minutes. Off you go.
Let's go!

13:11.833 --> 13:15.084
<i> This is the first</i>
<i> challenge to determine</i>
<i> who we want on our teams,</i>

13:15.086 --> 13:18.129
<i> and then I need</i>
<i> to see some finesse,</i>
<i> I need to see some cleverness.</i>

13:18.173 --> 13:21.591
I need to have that
next level chef in my team.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.303
- This is crazy.
- Let's do this.

13:26.723 --> 13:30.391
45 minutes, one dish.
This is first impressions.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.186
You want to be on team gordon,
team nyesha, team blais?

13:33.221 --> 13:34.270
- Now's a good--
- ( all cheering )

13:34.314 --> 13:36.147
richard:
Ah, there we go!

13:39.277 --> 13:41.152
Let's go.
Let's go.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.488
You better be impressive.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.156
You've had first pick
at ingredients.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.866
Oh, my god.
My hands are shaking.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.660
Next level dishes here.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.498
Gordon: Down here is
the opportunity to impress

13:53.500 --> 13:55.166
with or without protein.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.212
<i> The first time in the basement</i>
<i> for these five,</i>

13:59.256 --> 14:01.297
<i> a little bit panicked</i>
<i> grabbing those ingredients.</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:03.091
<i> Do I see potential?</i>
<i> Absolutely.</i>

14:03.134 --> 14:05.134
Maybe in one or two them.
But more importantly,

14:05.136 --> 14:07.679
<i> I've got to keep them away</i>
<i> from both my fellow judges.</i>

14:10.392 --> 14:11.391
How are you looking?
Looking good?

14:11.434 --> 14:12.684
I can't believe myself though.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.435
Forgot my starch and my veg.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.271
How are we doing, chef?

14:16.314 --> 14:17.188
I'm wonderful.
And yourself?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.147
- I can't complain.
- What's your name, sir?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.483
- I'm kenny.
- Walk me through your dish.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.902
Uh, seeing that I failed
to get what I needed,

14:22.946 --> 14:27.198
we're gonna do a duck breast,
and I'm gonna do a, uh...

14:27.242 --> 14:29.075
Uh, it'll come to me here
any second.

14:29.077 --> 14:33.037
The problem I'm having
is I missed some things
that were part of my dish.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.081
<i> All we can do is keep going.</i>

14:35.083 --> 14:36.207
You got that side, chef kenny?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.458
I do, chef.
We're gonna make this right.

14:37.502 --> 14:41.087
I always have been a fan
of chef arrington.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.088
What's your side?

14:42.132 --> 14:43.423
Duck with gastrique?

14:43.466 --> 14:44.382
Yes, ma'am.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.384
She will be a great asset to me,

14:46.428 --> 14:48.261
and I can be a great asset
to her team.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.470
<i> Hopefully she picks me.</i>

14:49.806 --> 14:52.223
- I wanna see
the best duck you got.
- Heard that, chef.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.018
Chefs, seven minutes
are gone already, okay?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.103
Ooh, that time goes quick!

14:57.147 --> 14:58.354
Ah!

14:58.398 --> 15:00.273
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.482
- What's your name?
- Pyet.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.151
What type of dish
are you making?

15:03.194 --> 15:05.320
I'm gonna do a corn purée.
I have chorizo here.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.322
- Okay.
- I have cabbage.
Gonna do a little slaw.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.157
- Big flavors.
Big flavors over here.
- Yeah.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.950
Going into the team pick,

15:10.994 --> 15:12.994
<i> I have to find people that are</i>
<i> showing some inspiration,</i>

15:13.038 --> 15:14.704
<i> people that I can work with,</i>
<i> because eventually</i>

15:14.748 --> 15:17.165
<i> they're gonna have to compete</i>
<i> on all three levels.</i>

15:17.208 --> 15:19.417
There's no frills
in the middle kitchen,

15:19.461 --> 15:22.045
so everyone's gonna have to get
very creative with flavor.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.465
<i> If piet can take chorizo</i>
<i> and sort of elevate it,</i>

15:25.508 --> 15:27.675
she might be someone
I want on team blais.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.219
Now is southwestern cuisine,
is that sort of
your bread and butter?

15:30.263 --> 15:34.724
Well, I'm a native american,
and a lot of what I eat is here.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.518
Chorizo usually isn't
a center of the plate protein.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.480
- It isn't. We've gotta
make it a star somehow.
- Okay.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.651
- 35 minutes to go.
- How's everybody doing?

15:44.694 --> 15:45.693
So far, not too bad.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.446
Right, tell me.
Where you from?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.657
Brooklyn, new york.
Originally from trinidad
in tobago.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.283
Got you. And the influence
in cooking came from where?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.328
Great grandmother, grandmother,
and my dad especially.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.790
Reuel:
<i> My name is reuel,</i>

15:58.833 --> 15:59.958
<i> I'm from brooklyn, new york.</i>

16:00.001 --> 16:02.377
I'm 34 years old,
and I'm a banquet chef.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.130
<i> My love for food comes from</i>
<i> the relationship with my dad.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:09.968
<i> My dad passed</i>
<i> about ten years ago.</i>

16:10.011 --> 16:11.177
<i> He was a cab driver,</i>

16:11.221 --> 16:15.056
<i> but at heart</i>
<i> he was definitely a chef.</i>

16:15.100 --> 16:18.685
<i> So when I have a tough day,</i>
<i> I just say to myself,</i>

16:18.728 --> 16:21.020
<i> "you're doing what he loves,</i>
<i> and you love it too."</i>

16:21.106 --> 16:22.522
<i> all the other mentors</i>
<i> are great,</i>

16:22.565 --> 16:26.401
<i> but I really want to be</i>
<i> on chef ramsay's team.</i>

16:26.444 --> 16:28.403
<i> I want cooks to know</i>
<i> that I'm here for blood.</i>

16:28.446 --> 16:31.114
<i> I want my presence to be felt.</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:32.949
<i> I'm here to earn this.</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:35.451
How are you gonna transform
that potted meat
into something exquisite?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.579
Stuff that
with celery root, and then
wrap it with the kale.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.457
Potted meat.
Never worked with that before.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.585
<i> But I'm grabbing stuff</i>
<i> that people don't want</i>

16:44.629 --> 16:46.254
<i> because I want to stand out.</i>

16:46.297 --> 16:47.755
So this is gonna be a hail mary.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.258
- Is it the next level?
- As best as I can, chef.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.553
- First name?
- Gary.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.304
Gary, you good?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.973
I've never cooked any of this.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.184
Is that all you got,
just peppers and veal?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.687
- And cheese.
- And cheese.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.522
- Yeah.
- No greens?

17:04.566 --> 17:05.690
No.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.317
- Love it.
- No starch?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.570
- I don't know.
- Are you okay?
You look petrified.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.280
I am.

17:12.282 --> 17:15.867
This is great.
Great first impression. Love it.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.160
- Background?
- Barbeque.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.661
- So you know how
to perfect meat?
- Yeah.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.082
You've got a super thin
veal cutlet right now to get you
to the next level.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.000
- Can you do it?
- Yeah.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.293
Let's go. Come on.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.295
You can be taught
to become a great chef.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.005
Don't dry out those tenders.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.048
<i> The one thing I want the most</i>

17:30.091 --> 17:32.258
from any chef on my team
is hunger.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.885
Come on, gary.
You can do this.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.888
I don't think nyesha or richard
are picking on those lines.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.347
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.144
- Oh, come on, chimichurri.
- You can do it!

17:44.522 --> 17:46.272
Dude, arborio rice--
does it cook like sticky rice?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.482
A little bit.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.233
Okay, okay, okay.
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.485
Are you talking
to yourself, ae?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.945
I'm still deciding.
I'm deciding what to put--

17:52.947 --> 17:54.822
I talk to myself too,
so I get it. I get it.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.116
If I should do
the shell in or out, would you
give me advice on that one?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.285
Well, normally at some point,
I will give you advice,

17:59.329 --> 18:00.286
- but not right now...
- Oh, okay.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.455
...Because this is where
you are gonna show us

18:02.499 --> 18:03.539
what you're all about.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.876
Today we're gonna be making
la papaya salad, okay?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.169
Aka tam maak hoong.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.630
My name is ae,
I live in san diego,

18:10.673 --> 18:12.507
<i> and I am lao and proud.</i>

18:12.550 --> 18:15.718
So let's get it popping!

18:15.804 --> 18:20.014
<i> I'm a social media chef</i>
<i> with over 350,000 followers.</i>

18:20.016 --> 18:22.433
<i> I'm here to represent umami,</i>

18:22.477 --> 18:26.020
pungency,
all that stanky stank food.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.690
<i> So I am hoping</i>
<i> to impress chef blais</i>

18:29.734 --> 18:32.068
<i> with my big flavors.</i>

18:32.112 --> 18:35.530
There you have it, guys.
Papaya salad.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.119
Hey, they're gonna kick you off
the island for that one.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.745
- Chef, how are you?
- Doing good, chef.

18:42.747 --> 18:43.746
What dish are you
making over here?

18:43.998 --> 18:46.874
So I'm probably gonna do
a whole roasted trout

18:46.918 --> 18:49.043
with some sort
of zucchini purée.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.294
Zucchini purée
I've never heard of before.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.420
Is that something you do a lot?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.589
No, I didn't really
grab too well,

18:53.633 --> 18:56.050
- so I'm gonna do the best
with what I got.
- Okay. Got it.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.095
I am a line cook
at a super ritzy country club.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.848
Hey, we need water over here.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.474
In the kitchen, that's one
of the only places in the world

19:03.518 --> 19:06.185
I feel, like, naturally
confident in myself.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.272
<i> I put in a lot of hard work,</i>
<i> so I just know</i>
<i> what I'm capable of,</i>

19:09.315 --> 19:14.026
<i> and I'm confident I can make</i>
<i> a delicious and excellent dish</i>
<i> to impress chef blais.</i>

19:14.028 --> 19:15.278
Oh, yeah.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.990
Just over 30 minutes!

19:19.033 --> 19:20.283
Watch those fingers.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.452
Talk to me about your dish.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.122
So I'm going to make
a seared scallop

19:26.166 --> 19:28.166
with a lime curd.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.293
I want you to speak
with your chest.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.211
Chef, I also decided
to add some toasted sesame

19:32.255 --> 19:33.921
- into the miso cream sauce.
- Good job.

19:34.382 --> 19:38.968
In the top level kitchen,
these chefs have everything
they can possible dream of.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.597
What I'm looking for is a chef
that can listen and learn.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.931
Make it reality, yes?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.516
- Heard.
- All: Yes, chef.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.397
Devonnie: Oh.
Medic. I cut myself.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.141
Do I wanna have a cut right now
in the middle of a cook?

19:54.152 --> 19:56.277
-<i> Absolutely not. </i>
- Medic!

19:56.279 --> 19:58.404
I'm embarrassed because
chef arrington is right there,

19:58.448 --> 20:01.657
<i> and I really wanna be</i>
<i> on chef arrington's team.</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:02.992
It's definitely panic mode.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.286
Oh. It's not great.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.128
Devonnie: I cut myself.
I need a medic.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.464
Medic, over here.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.299
- You all right, dee?
- I wasn't paying attention.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.468
This is not a place to play.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.053
- If you want to win this...
- I gotta bring it.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.180
...You have to bring your focus
and attention, yes?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.640
- I gotta bring it. Yes, chef.
- You can do it.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.226
Watching these chefs cook,
it's apparent that some chefs

20:28.269 --> 20:29.227
need a little bit more work.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.270
- Can you continue? Okay.
- Yes, for sure.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.522
<i> But at this point</i>
<i> in the competition,</i>

20:33.566 --> 20:35.024
<i> there are no teams,</i>

20:35.068 --> 20:37.151
and I'm not sure
I want someone on my team

20:37.195 --> 20:39.153
who does not work well
under pressure.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.989
You are just over
20 minutes, guys.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.075
- Heard, chef.
- Bring it home.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.662
Come on,
this second floor's not bad.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.247
No, it's not! It's not!

20:49.290 --> 20:50.414
It's nicer than a lot
of restaurants I worked in.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.124
Richard: You ready
for the next level

20:52.168 --> 20:53.918
even if that next level's
down below?

20:53.962 --> 20:55.294
Yes, chef.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.463
Gordon:
Make these dishes elevated.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.758
Let's not let any piece
of equipment stand in our way.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.218
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.642
- It's too dull, man.
- You got this.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.394
- Right, first name?
- Courtney.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.522
Now tell me about the dish.
Where are we going with this?
You got the chicken tenders.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.108
I'm literally going to pan sear
this on both sides.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.985
And then I'll get
my sauce going, and I'll
put them back in the sauce

21:19.028 --> 21:20.236
- so they can-- yeah.
- Sounds good.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.697
14 minutes to go.
Now, first name is?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.898
- My name is angie, chef.
- Angie, where are you from?

21:24.909 --> 21:28.244
- I'm from lubbock, texas.
I grabbed the lamb loin.
- What did you grab?

21:28.288 --> 21:30.288
- I'm surprised
that's down here.
- Yeah. Okay.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.290
- I'm surprised that didn't
get stolen on the top floor.
- Yeah, I agree.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.709
I would really like
to impress chef ramsay,

21:34.752 --> 21:38.004
<i> but at the same time,</i>
<i> I'm not classically trained.</i>

21:38.006 --> 21:39.213
<i> I am a home chef.</i>

21:39.257 --> 21:42.258
I'm like, I hope
he doesn't know I'm the fraud.

21:42.302 --> 21:46.345
- So, lamb loin.
- I'm making a kale salad
to put the steak on.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.264
- Is it wilted kale salad or
is it gonna be actually raw?
- It's massaged.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.267
- Oh, boy.
- So you got pork steak.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.227
Looked almost like
a shoulder cut, didn't it?

21:53.271 --> 21:55.104
- It did.
- Yeah.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.273
And then you got fennel apples.
That's a...

21:57.317 --> 22:00.401
A fennel and apple salad
with a citrus-y vinaigrette.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.903
- Where are you from?
- I'm from alabama.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.947
They're not putting fennel
in slaw in alabama usually.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.115
Not usually, no.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.660
<i> I'm jonathan.</i>
<i> I'm from columbiana, alabama.</i>

22:09.704 --> 22:11.662
I'm a science camp coordinator
and a home cook.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.414
<i> On a lot of Friday nights,</i>

22:13.416 --> 22:16.917
<i> my driveway becomes</i>
<i> kind of a little restaurant.</i>

22:16.961 --> 22:18.336
<i> It's about building community</i>

22:18.338 --> 22:21.255
<i> and food being a thing</i>
<i> that brings you together.</i>

22:21.299 --> 22:23.299
<i> I have a lot to prove</i>
<i> in this competition.</i>

22:23.343 --> 22:26.093
I'm a home cook
going in with professionals,

22:26.137 --> 22:28.304
and I've gotta prove that,
you know,

22:28.348 --> 22:31.515
we've got a lot to offer
just being home cooks.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.060
<i> But I understand flavor</i>
<i> and I know how to cook.</i>

22:34.103 --> 22:37.396
I'm gonna apply all
of those things and hopefully
stick to my southern roots.

22:37.398 --> 22:40.358
<i> And I think that could be</i>
<i> what wins me this competition.</i>

22:41.736 --> 22:43.110
Have you ever cooked
with this type of pork steak?

22:43.112 --> 22:44.612
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.322
- A lot of fat,
a lot of flavor in there.
- A lot of flavor. Yes, sir.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.698
- All right, keep going.
- Thank you so much.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.241
12 1/2 minutes left, chefs,

22:49.702 --> 22:54.997
and the whole time
you're thinking about how
can I be the next level chef?

22:54.999 --> 22:56.707
Oh! Hot pan.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.919
- How's the rice over there?
It's a tough rice to cook.
- It is.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.422
I thought it would be very cute
to do an herb-y shrimp bowl

23:03.466 --> 23:06.008
because I had gotten dill
and parsley as well.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.552
<i> But then of course,</i>
<i> life happens, right?</i>

23:08.596 --> 23:10.888
I overcooked the rice,
and I'm like, "what do I do?"

23:10.932 --> 23:13.057
yeah, I'm gonna do
a curry sauce.

23:13.101 --> 23:16.644
And I create
a shrimp curry bowl.

23:16.687 --> 23:17.770
<i> And I'm trying to be sneaky,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

23:18.106 --> 23:19.939
Like, let's just make
the curry sauce a little thick

23:19.982 --> 23:22.566
and do it over the rice and try
to hide the rice a little bit.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.443
I'm so ( bleep ).

23:24.445 --> 23:26.862
Do you wanna just cook it
right off the grill

23:26.906 --> 23:27.822
and then go right
to the plate with it or...

23:28.074 --> 23:29.949
I'm gonna let it rest
for a few minutes,

23:29.992 --> 23:31.367
and then maybe slice it
against the grain

23:31.411 --> 23:32.535
since it's kind of
a tough cut of meat.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.869
All right.
You know what's up.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.496
- It's real life now, chefs.
- Whew!

23:35.540 --> 23:39.375
On the middle floor,
there's no room for mediocrity.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.502
<i> Being a leader,</i>
<i> being a restaurateur,</i>

23:41.546 --> 23:43.462
<i> it's about finding</i>
<i> great people,</i>

23:43.506 --> 23:46.048
<i> and I do that</i>
<i> better than anyone.</i>

23:46.092 --> 23:49.510
And I'll be honest,
I've got my eyes on a few chefs.

23:49.512 --> 23:52.337
- How are you feeling, sir?
- I'm feeling good, man.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.515
I changed recipe, like,
ten times, and I'm on the money.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.226
Do you always cook your fish
at this temperature?

23:57.270 --> 23:58.978
I just wanna flash a little bit.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.856
And we have an amazing array
of tools here.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.357
One might be a fish spatula.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.401
Yep, nope.
You're right. You're right.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.319
Sometimes, yeah.
I might be, huh?

24:07.363 --> 24:09.864
You love those tongs, my friend.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.282
Love them.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.242
- The fish doesn't
love them though.
- I know.

24:13.286 --> 24:17.621
Nyesha:<i> I spent two years</i>
<i> working a three-star</i>
<i> michelin restaurant,</i>

24:17.665 --> 24:20.082
<i> and as a 20-year veteran</i>
<i> in cooking,</i>

24:20.084 --> 24:25.838
I'm not looking for someone
who does not have the ability
to adapt and learn.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.423
<i> Sergio's cooking with ego.</i>

24:27.467 --> 24:30.384
Honestly, I'm not sure I want
someone like that on my team.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.261
Two minutes, guys!
Start plating!

24:32.305 --> 24:34.430
Whoo! This is not
like cooking at home.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.098
Bring it home.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.100
Richard:
Have you tasted everything?

24:38.144 --> 24:39.935
Is it good enough
to get gordon, nyesha,

24:39.979 --> 24:42.313
or myself to choose you
for our teams?

24:42.356 --> 24:44.648
Gordon: 60 seconds to go.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.108
Whoo!
That looks good, gary.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.526
Gordon: Focus, guys.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.153
Here comes the platform.

24:49.197 --> 24:53.073
Oh, ( bleep ).
I'm not ready to go,
but at this point

24:53.117 --> 24:56.368
this is my one time
to impress the mentors.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.497
Gordon: Remember, our food
goes on the bottom tier.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.124
- Stop breaking!
- Gordon: Come on.

25:02.168 --> 25:08.047
Five, four, three, two, one.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.799
- Good job, guys.
- Man!

25:10.843 --> 25:14.929
Chefs,
you have 15 seconds to get your
plate on the platform now.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.805
Whoo! It's there!

25:16.849 --> 25:18.599
Richard:
You gotta put it on a charger.
You gotta put it on the charger.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.476
I'm not impressed.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.897
Richard:
Five, four, three, two, one.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.232
Whoo! Yes!

25:27.443 --> 25:29.193
Nyesha: It's here.
Platform's here, guys.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.987
Sergio, 15 seconds.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.156
Plates on the platform,
let's go!

25:34.158 --> 25:36.992
Focus!
Let's go, sergio!

25:37.036 --> 25:42.289
Time's ticking away.
Five, four, three, two.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.208
Let's go! That platform's
not waiting for you!

25:44.252 --> 25:46.460
Get on that, serg.
Get on it. Come on, serg!

25:46.462 --> 25:48.128
( overlapping chatter )

25:48.172 --> 25:50.923
- oh, no!
- Oh, no!

25:50.967 --> 25:52.299
Serg.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.642
Richard:
Now that you've cooked
your next level dish,

26:01.686 --> 26:04.562
it's time for us to taste them
so we can decide
who we want on our team.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.940
For me, I think it's about
transforming ingredients,

26:07.942 --> 26:13.112
when you take something
very basic and reinvent it
and make it amazing.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.197
To me, I'm looking
for that magic moment,

26:15.241 --> 26:19.702
that one bite that combines
technique with creativity

26:19.745 --> 26:22.204
and just ultimate flavors.

26:22.248 --> 26:26.166
Looking across these dishes,
there's some
real clear standouts.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.127
- Shall we taste?
- Nyesha: Absolutely.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.337
- Richard: Let's go
- let's start with
the top floor.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.174
Let's try the duck first.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.044
Kenny:
<i>Like, my stomach is at my feet.</i>

26:37.054 --> 26:41.223
My first dish,
my first shot at $250,000,

26:41.267 --> 26:44.393
<i> I'm serving chef ramsay</i>
<i> duck and gastrique.</i>

26:44.437 --> 26:46.186
There's hardly anything
on there.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.147
- No veg?
- No veg.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.149
- No starch.
- Nyesha: No starch.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.652
( sighs )
this is not a good look.

26:57.158 --> 26:58.991
Gordon:
Why's it so sweet?

26:58.993 --> 27:00.451
Nyesha:
Great question, chef.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.161
That's very strange.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.288
Every mouthful I take
across these dishes

27:04.332 --> 27:05.539
I'm planning my strategy.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.166
<i> I gotta be very coy</i>

27:07.209 --> 27:09.460
<i> and not give too much away</i>
<i> to nyesha and richard.</i>

27:09.503 --> 27:12.212
Some of the most important
comments I'm keeping up here.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.298
Let's go for the sea bass.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.385
Skin not seared.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.181
Yeah. So, inside
is cooked beautifully.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.266
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah, but the skin is so soft.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.645
- Veg is cooked well.
- <i> I can spot brilliance</i>
<i> a mile away,</i>

27:27.688 --> 27:29.313
but I can taste it instantly,

27:29.357 --> 27:31.273
<i> and that sea bass</i>
<i> was cooked beautifully.</i>

27:31.275 --> 27:33.192
<i> That's what I need</i>
<i> on my team.</i>

27:35.363 --> 27:38.030
How did they cook this thing?
Oh, dear.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.324
- Overcooked. Damn.
- Nyesha: Wow.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.078
- Salmon.
- What cook in their right mind

27:44.121 --> 27:46.955
would cook a skin
nice and crispy
and then dunk it in a purée?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.374
It's almost like
you're trying to hide it.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.293
- Yeah.
- It looks a little dark too.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.337
Nyesha:
Very under-seasoned.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.422
- Wow.
- Okay, scallops.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.715
Gordon:
That is minimalistic, right?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.092
Nyesha:
Very minimalistic.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.679
I am definitely hoping
I'm selected by chef ramsay.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.765
<i> He is one</i>
<i> of my biggest inspirations</i>
<i> for becoming a chef.</i>

28:04.809 --> 28:07.476
- Great sear.
- The scallop is cooked
really, really nice.

28:07.478 --> 28:11.397
Yeah. I didn't watch any of you
cook on the top floor,

28:11.440 --> 28:16.235
but I've definitely
spotted some great potential
for my team.

28:16.278 --> 28:19.405
- Right. Should we move
to the middle floor?
- Sure.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.991
Gordon:
What is this? A chorizo?

28:22.993 --> 28:25.285
A chorizo.
This is, like, a corn purée.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.495
Almost like a fresh corn grits.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.790
Chorizo,
not exactly a high end cut.
Tough to work with.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.960
The fact that
it was that dry means it was
really overcooked too.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.462
Mm. These guys are bagging
on that chorizo dish,

28:35.506 --> 28:39.082
but the spice
with the sweetness,
it danced in my mouth,

28:39.093 --> 28:41.218
and I think this
is a sleeper dish right here.

28:43.431 --> 28:48.851
- Trout? Tough one.
- Bold. Whole fish cooking.
I respect it.

28:48.894 --> 28:49.935
What's the purée?

28:49.979 --> 28:51.145
Richard:
Zucchini brown butter purée.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.397
- Nyesha: Oh, beautiful.
- Mmm.

28:53.441 --> 28:56.692
- There's some heat
in there as well.
- Nyesha: Oh, wow.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.152
This is interesting.

28:58.154 --> 29:01.071
All right, so we got
a skirt steak with some farrow

29:01.115 --> 29:03.365
and some brussels
and a spinach chimichurri.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.410
Steak is stunning.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.246
That is exactly what that
steak's supposed to taste like.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.915
You can tell it was cooked
at the perfect time.

29:11.959 --> 29:16.086
- Right, what's this?
- So we got a pork steak
right here.

29:16.130 --> 29:20.007
Uh-huh.
It's cooked beautifully.
Man, the rub's good.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.550
The rub's good.
The steak is cooked well.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.510
- It's a tricky cut.
- Very well-balanced.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.889
Gordon:
<i> In these dishes I'm looking</i>
<i> for flair, restraint,</i>

29:26.932 --> 29:30.017
but more importantly,
every mouthful,
I wanna taste passion.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.894
<i> Now, whoever cooked</i>
<i> that pork steak</i>

29:31.937 --> 29:33.479
<i> has that flair</i>
<i> I'm looking for.</i>

29:33.522 --> 29:37.024
<i> Hopefully richard or nyesha</i>
<i> doesn't snatch them up.</i>

29:37.067 --> 29:39.151
It's shrimp, right?

29:39.195 --> 29:42.654
We have a shrimp and rice bowl
using arborio rice

29:42.698 --> 29:44.448
and turmeric-based curry.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.951
That's not arborio rice.
That's overcooked rice.

29:47.995 --> 29:52.456
Who the hell am I
to think I could hide my rice
from chef ramsay, huh?

29:52.500 --> 29:55.042
- We could've done more
with the rice.
- Seems like an afterthought.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.419
Second floor kitchen, guys,
I'm sorry.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.755
I'm kinda hoping
that no one realizes

29:59.799 --> 30:01.256
<i> that there's</i>
<i> a delicious curry there.</i>

30:01.634 --> 30:04.635
They're definitely things
that I'm not talking
a lot about that I love.

30:06.180 --> 30:10.933
Basement.
Right, let's start off
with potted meat.

30:10.976 --> 30:15.187
So this is done with layers
of celery root confit

30:15.231 --> 30:17.147
wrapped in large kale leaves.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.982
Richard: I mean,
replace the potted meat
with some venison,

30:18.984 --> 30:22.402
- I've seen this in
one of your books, chef.
- This is crazy.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.446
- Cheesy grits.
- Bloody hell.

30:24.490 --> 30:29.827
Making a stand-out dish
from the basement is really what
this competition's about.

30:29.829 --> 30:33.622
I know we're all thinking
we want whoever made
that dish on our team.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.625
Chicken tenders.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.466
Richard: A little too much
on the rosemary,

30:44.751 --> 30:46.093
but I'm happy with the cook
on the chicken tenders.

30:46.762 --> 30:52.474
I just don't know if you put
a rosemary cream sauce with
pickled cucumbers. Sorry.

30:52.518 --> 30:56.478
Right, so this individual
forgot to pick up a protein.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.147
So he turned it into
a vegetarian

30:59.182 --> 31:03.068
cauliflower steak purée
and little florets.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.821
You know we've got
no blenders down there,

31:05.865 --> 31:07.322
- so that's hand puréed.
- Wow.

31:07.658 --> 31:10.951
Cauliflower's having a moment,
and I'm having a moment
with that dish.

31:10.995 --> 31:16.039
This cauliflower dish,
to me it was the most
beautiful visual dish.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.917
<i> I need whoever cooked this</i>
<i> on my team.</i>

31:18.961 --> 31:23.088
<i> I just have to make sure</i>
<i> gordon and nyesha don't</i>
<i> pick them before I do.</i>

31:23.132 --> 31:25.716
Now this protein I didn't expect
to see in the basement,

31:25.759 --> 31:26.967
the loin of lamb.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.219
How did the top
and second floor miss that one?

31:29.263 --> 31:32.598
How does it go down
to the basement? A gift!

31:32.641 --> 31:35.475
Okay, I'm dying to see
how that lamb's cooked.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.104
Look at that.
That's beautiful.

31:39.148 --> 31:42.065
- Oh, my gosh. Gorgeous.
- Nyesha: Seasoned nicely.

31:42.109 --> 31:45.485
- That, ma'am, is delicious.
- This is impressive
coming from the basement.

31:45.529 --> 31:49.531
You have these mentors
tasting your food and smiling.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.911
I could've it all ended there
and I would be so happy.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.038
Gordon: One of
the most minimalistic dishes.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.956
This individual grabbed
three ingredients.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.083
- Nyesha: Wow.
- But that looks good.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.753
- Beautiful.
- Shall we get in?

32:02.796 --> 32:05.505
So delicate.
There's a cheese sauce
and a schnitzel.

32:06.967 --> 32:10.218
Guys, the three ingredients
is elevated, right?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.179
I mean, that shows you what you
can do with three ingredients.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.014
- Totally.
- Yeah.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.224
Oh, my god. I'm on cloud nine

32:16.268 --> 32:18.143
because they actually
liked this dish

32:18.145 --> 32:20.145
that has almost nothing on it!

32:25.185 --> 32:26.276
Gordon:
Right, let's be honest.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.402
I think we can all agree
there's some hits

32:27.738 --> 32:32.908
and there's some misses,
but I know I've tasted enough

32:32.952 --> 32:37.245
to start choosing my team
to be mentored.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.249
Yeah. Chef, I think we may want
some of the same people here.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.336
Okay, nyesha, first pick.
Off you go.

32:45.381 --> 32:48.423
Gordon, since this is
your brainchild,

32:48.425 --> 32:50.676
I believe you
should get first pick.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.053
- Really?
- I do. It's fair.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.596
Gordon: I'd love that.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.973
On the back of that tasting,

32:56.058 --> 33:01.228
there is a dish that hands down
is somewhat surprising.

33:01.271 --> 33:05.023
They were dealt
a dysfunctional card.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.526
My first pick
on team ramsay is...

33:13.283 --> 33:18.120
My first pick on team ramsay
is that processed meat.

33:18.163 --> 33:22.457
Reuel, come here.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.004
- Congratulations.
- Appreciate it.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.131
- Welcome to team ramsay.
- Thank you.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.299
Get ready to work.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.635
Like, I wanna scream right now,
honestly speaking.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.430
<i> I want to pick up a phone</i>
<i> and call my dad.</i>

33:36.473 --> 33:39.266
And I just want to be like,
"yo, dad, I got picked first."

33:39.268 --> 33:42.894
pops, you would be proud
'cause he was a good cook too.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.690
- How are you feeling?
- ( bleep ) ecstatic.
Emotional.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.484
Young man, let me tell you,
that for me is next level.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.570
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, chef.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.032
Good job, big boy.
Good job.

33:55.075 --> 33:58.952
Okay, nyesha,
these are the teams we're gonna
be stuck with all season,

33:58.996 --> 34:03.081
so this is
the most important choice
we'll make to the very end.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.292
- Here we go.
- Kenny:<i> Chef arrington,</i>

34:05.294 --> 34:07.002
<i> she was on the top floor</i>
<i> mentoring me.</i>

34:07.004 --> 34:08.920
I want her to continue
to mentor me.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.673
<i> The way she moves, her drive,</i>

34:11.717 --> 34:13.341
<i> nothing stops chef arrington.</i>

34:13.385 --> 34:15.844
- I want that.
- Be careful here,
whatever you choose.

34:15.888 --> 34:19.222
- Because?
- Because I don't want you to
pick who I'm trying to get.

34:19.266 --> 34:24.144
So this team pick
is extremely high stakes, right?

34:24.188 --> 34:26.521
I want the next level chef
on my team.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.525
The trout zucchini
brown butter purée.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.360
Step forward.
Who cooked this dish?

34:37.326 --> 34:39.242
- What's your name, sir?
- Zach. Nice to meet you.

34:39.286 --> 34:41.620
- Zach, nyesha. Pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.163
Welcome to team nyesha.

34:43.207 --> 34:45.332
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- Good job.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.959
Good job.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.544
Don't let me down, zach!

34:49.588 --> 34:50.629
Never, chef.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.214
- Great job.
- Appreciate it.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.216
- Richard, first pick.
- All right.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.302
My first pick right here,
the sauce was outstanding.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.596
The technique was precise.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.015
Richard blais,
he has restaurants in san diego,

35:02.017 --> 35:04.142
and I'm a san diego girl.
So I'm, like, loyalty.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.477
<i> I wanna be on chef blais'</i>
<i> team for sure.</i>

35:05.854 --> 35:11.525
Richard:
That dish also just happened
to be cooked on my floor.

35:11.568 --> 35:15.362
The skirt steak.
Welcome to team blais, mariah.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.157
( bleep )

35:19.201 --> 35:20.659
- thank you so much, chef.
- Great job.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.202
- You're gonna bring it, right?
- Yes, sir.

35:22.246 --> 35:25.539
That chimichurri, if you're
doing that sort of sauce work

35:25.582 --> 35:27.624
all season long, look out.

35:27.668 --> 35:28.583
I was looking at that one.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.327
- This is tough.
- Very.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.004
But there was one protein
tonight that was seared
beautifully.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.465
Step forward whoever cooked
those scallops.

35:38.595 --> 35:42.139
- Oh!
- Good job, girl.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.599
- First name?
- Tricia.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.892
How many times
have you cooked scallops?

35:45.936 --> 35:47.269
This is my second time, chef.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.271
- You've only cooked
scallops twice?
- Yes, chef.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.148
What do you do for a living?

35:51.191 --> 35:53.191
I stream on twitch
my cooking, chef.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.193
What the ( bleep ) is twitch?

35:56.113 --> 35:58.155
A livestream platform, chef.

35:58.198 --> 36:02.784
Young lady, they are
seared top and bottom
to absolute utter perfection.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.620
- Thank you, chef.
- I just wanna say welcome
to team ramsay.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.665
Thank you, chef.

36:11.128 --> 36:14.045
I still can't believe
chef ramsay picked me.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.757
I'm so--just so happy.

36:17.801 --> 36:21.261
- I'm at a loss for words.
- You did good. You did good.

36:21.305 --> 36:24.556
Pick anyone you want, gordon.
I'm still gonna beat you.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.516
All right, chefs, my turn.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.187
Second choice,

36:30.230 --> 36:35.358
I'm going to go
with this chorizo dish.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.527
Wow.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.115
- What's your name, chef?
- Pyet. Pyet.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.366
- Pyet, pleasure.
- Thank you. Thank you, chef.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.327
Welcome to team nyesha.
Bring it.

36:45.329 --> 36:47.913
- I will. I got you, girl.
- Got you too.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.707
- ( muted chatter )
- wow, this is tough.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.793
Because there's a couple
of plates out here
that I want on my team,

36:53.837 --> 36:55.462
and I would hate to pass someone

36:55.505 --> 36:57.297
and not get them
later in the game.

36:57.332 --> 37:02.135
The dish I want
for team blais is...

37:03.472 --> 37:04.471
...The pork steak.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.472
The pork steak.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.185
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah!

37:10.229 --> 37:11.811
- Welcome to the team, jonathan.
- Thank you, chef.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.355
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Welcome to the team.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.357
- No.
- There is no way ( bleep ) way

37:15.400 --> 37:18.985
I'm letting blais
or nyesha get one over me.

37:19.029 --> 37:22.197
Jonathan,
do you wanna take this?

37:22.241 --> 37:25.116
Come on!
Careful, jonathan.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.661
Yes or no?
Would you like to swap?

37:29.665 --> 37:30.497
Yes or no?

37:30.791 --> 37:32.082
Richard:
<i> This is a breach of etiquette.</i>

37:32.125 --> 37:33.458
Gordon is gordon ramsay.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.834
<i> He has, you know,</i>
<i> how many hundreds</i>

37:34.878 --> 37:36.086
<i> of millions of followers.</i>

37:36.129 --> 37:38.588
I want to work
with gordon ramsay!

37:38.632 --> 37:39.881
But that's not fair.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.883
- Uh--
- oh, my god.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.134
Give me an answer.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.309
Would you like to swap?
Yes or no?

37:52.396 --> 37:54.020
Uh--

37:54.064 --> 37:56.231
- don't, don't.
- Give me an answer.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.067
Jonathan, yes.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.527
He picked me first.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.028
He said I picked him first,
gordon.

38:02.364 --> 38:05.073
- He picked me first.
He believes in me.
- He's a man of integrity.

38:05.117 --> 38:08.201
Jonathan:
<i> That's a tough decision.</i>
<i> I mean, it's gordon ramsay.</i>

38:08.203 --> 38:10.787
I firmly believe you've gotta
stick with the people
who believed in you first.

38:10.831 --> 38:13.373
You can just leave people
for something shiny
that comes along.

38:13.417 --> 38:17.043
This next pick
is gonna shock you all.

38:17.087 --> 38:20.213
Step forward the person
who forgot to pick up a protein.

38:20.257 --> 38:24.092
- Oh, no.
- Oh, come on now.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.219
Good stuff, man.

38:27.264 --> 38:30.598
Roice, this dish
is absolutely stunning.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.392
Welcome to team ramsay.

38:32.436 --> 38:34.060
- Thank you, chef.
- Come on, roice.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.063
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.484
Everyone's name's getting
called, you know, one by one.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.653
<i> I'm just wondering why</i>
<i> I haven't been picked.</i>

38:43.697 --> 38:45.488
This is starting to upset me.

38:45.532 --> 38:49.951
Okay, I'm going to go
with the lamb.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.619
- Ooh.
- Wow.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.417
- Thank you so much.
- Name?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.377
- I'm angie. Yeah.
- Angie, pleasure.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.671
- Welcome to team nyesha.
- Thank you.

39:01.715 --> 39:07.218
Okay, I'm going with
the chicken fried schnitzel
on team blais.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.961
- Yes, gary.
- The schnitzel.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.263
Good job, gary.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.474
- Come grab your apron.
- Thank you.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.975
Tuck the beard under it.

39:15.145 --> 39:19.230
- Who cooked the striped bass?
- Oh, girl.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.650
- First name?
- Devonnie.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.361
Welcome to team ramsay.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.367
Amber, step forward please.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.534
Aw.

39:33.747 --> 39:35.121
- Welcome to team nyesha.
Good job.
- Thank you.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.414
And texas is not
gonna let me back

39:36.666 --> 39:39.250
- if I cook a steak
like that again.
- Let's go, chef.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.045
You stole one from me.
That was my next pick
right there.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.047
I am going
with the shrimp curry.

39:44.716 --> 39:45.507
- Yes!
- Good job.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.176
- Welcome to the team.
- Thank you!

39:48.220 --> 39:49.260
Last pick.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.138
Is it strategy in terms
of who do I dump

39:52.182 --> 39:54.349
on richard and nyesha's team,

39:54.351 --> 39:57.060
or do I pick someone
that needs help?

39:58.313 --> 40:02.023
The person who cooked this duck,
step forward.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.943
You guys in trouble.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.861
- Kenny!
- Kenny!

40:08.073 --> 40:10.407
- Can you do better than this?
- Absolutely.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.617
- Prove it to me, kenny.
- Yes, sir.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.494
- Welcome to team ramsay.
- Appreciate it.

40:17.290 --> 40:19.582
Gordon:<i> Yes, kenny messed up</i>
<i> that platform grab,</i>

40:19.626 --> 40:21.459
<i> but that duck</i>
<i> was cooked beautifully.</i>

40:21.503 --> 40:25.130
<i> Every person I've chosen</i>
<i> for my team, I can see</i>
<i> something special,</i>

40:25.132 --> 40:26.965
and it's my job now
to bring it all together.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.591
Nyesha, last pick.

40:31.388 --> 40:33.221
- Who do you want, chef?
- You know what dish I want.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.681
I want the chicken tenders.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.476
Super tough.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.688
<i> It's a very tough choice.</i>

40:41.731 --> 40:43.398
The competitive side of me

40:43.442 --> 40:47.026
wants to definitely take
courtney away from richard.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.446
But the mentor side of me

40:49.489 --> 40:52.031
wants to take sergio
the whole way.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.700
I know he needs it.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.285
I watched this gentleman cook

40:55.328 --> 41:00.123
and almost had a little bit
of an arrogance.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.668
As this is
a mentorship competition,

41:03.712 --> 41:05.336
I'm gonna see this through.

41:06.631 --> 41:10.467
- Sergio, step forward.
- Wow.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.303
- Good job, sergio.
- I wanna know if you're ready

41:13.346 --> 41:16.514
to humble yourself
and receive information.

41:16.558 --> 41:17.932
- 100%.
- Can you tell me--

41:17.976 --> 41:19.100
a little over my head.
100%, I'm open to learn.

41:19.436 --> 41:22.479
Listen, when I'm speaking,
I need you to listen to me.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.898
- Okay? 'cause
I'm not speaking in vain.
- Yes, chef.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.442
- Swallow your pride. Let's go.
- Ready to learn. Thank you.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.153
Awkward!

41:31.239 --> 41:34.032
I'm going
with the chicken tenders.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.325
- What's your name?
- Courtney.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.453
- Courtney, do you
follow sports at all?
- I do follow sports.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.247
Tom brady was drafted,
like, 199th.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.124
He's one of the greatest
athletes of all time.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.001
Welcome to team blais.
We're gonna do this.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.295
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.380
- Gordon: Wow.
- Come on.

41:49.382 --> 41:53.092
To be selected last, you have
to claw your way back up.

41:53.136 --> 41:55.303
<i> I'm going to cook my ass off</i>

41:55.347 --> 41:59.390
every single day
from here on out.

41:59.434 --> 42:03.937
Your dreams right now
are within your reach.

42:03.980 --> 42:07.607
You just need to level up
and grab them.

42:07.651 --> 42:10.026
Who is the next level chef?

42:10.070 --> 42:12.487
- All: Me!
- Let's go!

42:12.531 --> 42:14.572
Right, all of you,
get some rest.

42:14.616 --> 42:17.408
I promise you
you're gonna need it.
Good night.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.411
You guys are done for.
Trust me.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.081
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.291
I picked a killer team.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.627
These two, they're not
gonna know what hit them

42:27.671 --> 42:28.878
when we get to
the next challenge.

42:29.256 --> 42:31.798
Honestly, like, it kinda worked
out like a master plan for me.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.592
- I got the squad.
Aww, come on. Here we go.
- I've got my winner.

42:36.429 --> 42:39.138
<i> Next time,</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:40.725 --> 42:43.393
You each have
an amazing mentor,

42:43.395 --> 42:46.437
but tonight, one of you will be
leaving the competition.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.023
- Was that a protein?
- A gift from the heavens!

42:49.067 --> 42:51.859
- Oh, I love that sizzle!
- ( bleep )

42:51.903 --> 42:55.363
- I just burnt the sauce.
- Anything can happen,
and it's happening.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.116
You'll be sent into
a head-to-head battle

42:58.159 --> 43:00.159
- to determine who's going home.
- What is happening?

43:00.203 --> 43:03.162
Everything you put on that plate
is worth a quarter million
dollars. Come on!

43:03.206 --> 43:05.206
Time to bring the heat.
