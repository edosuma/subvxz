WEBVTT

00:15.765 --> 00:17.767
Is she usually late?

00:18.685 --> 00:19.686
Nope.

00:20.770 --> 00:21.855
Well, things happen.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.399
Things happen.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.445
Yeah. Shall we order?

00:28.445 --> 00:30.238
It's polite to wait, isn't it?

00:30.864 --> 00:31.906
So we'll wait.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.326
Felim Bichan
and his superstitions.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.664
It's a shame because I prefer
the two of you together.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.915
You know, I'm...

00:40.999 --> 00:42.250
I'm sure she's got

00:42.250 --> 00:43.668
- a good excuse.
Right.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.795
Any chance
we could tempt you
on a tour of the floor?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.464
Oh, I'm not particularly geared

00:47.464 --> 00:49.841
towards making you look
like a rock star on the desk.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.176
Uh, just the car please.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.886
He wants to show you
how many screens he has.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.054
Well, Bloomberg did actually
just hit me up

00:55.138 --> 00:57.140
- with a six-monitor rig.
- That was great.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.058
By the way,
we've just published our macro

00:59.142 --> 01:01.144
- year ahead predictions--
- I'm sorry.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.646
Do you have any idea
how often salespeople bring me

01:03.730 --> 01:06.274
reams of immaterial material?

01:06.274 --> 01:08.193
I'm just not interested
in people

01:08.193 --> 01:09.736
who comment on
the direction of the wind.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.030
I'd-- I'd much prefer
if you could make it blow.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.407
Ask yourself,
"What's your edge?"

01:15.033 --> 01:16.034
How can you be

01:16.034 --> 01:18.203
more essential
to me than these...

01:18.203 --> 01:19.412
...vultures?

01:26.002 --> 01:28.505
Oh, um...

01:28.505 --> 01:32.008
- Uh, actually, I'm, uh--
- Thank you for coming.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.511
We've reserved
the box at Anfield

01:34.511 --> 01:36.179
for you and Leo this Friday.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.473
- Derby Day under the lights--
- John Henry's a close friend.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.684
And on Friday,
my son is ritually
humiliating me at tennis.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.936
So, thank you but no thank you.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.354
We've got a court
at the Hurlingham you could use?

01:44.354 --> 01:47.607
We're very happy
with our new Highgate patch.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.027
Um, yeah? Okay. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.570
Um...

01:52.654 --> 01:54.739
Hey!
Good luck with everything.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.325
Remember it's all just a cycle
of victory and defeat.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.828
Excuse me.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.747
What an epic bloke.
I think he likes me.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.999
I was primary coverage
on Maxim's fund.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.253
I've done a lot of work
with FutureDawn Partners.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.965
Um, lots of
flow-slash-execution stuff.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.510
But I would love to learn more
about Private Wealth Management.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.928
"Flow."

02:16.928 --> 02:19.430
You almost
make that sound delicious.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.557
And the people?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.851
They're fine.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.770
Sorry. So, um...

02:26.729 --> 02:30.066
what you'd expect.
You know, in line.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.027
It's ugly work.
Market-facing roles.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.072
There's nothing elegant
in that part of the business.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.242
I imagine they hate you.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.953
You know,

02:41.953 --> 02:45.540
I think you've really
just crystallized that for me.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.085
Yeah, I think
they fucking despise me.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.297
Yes.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.091
Oh, and the quiet heart
of the hatred,

02:55.091 --> 02:56.634
which, of course,
they never ever

02:56.718 --> 02:59.846
articulate to you is,
you're aspirational to them.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.016
Hmm.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.117
I am single, though.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.498
I have this client and his son.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.835
Enzo is a Cucinelli type.
Very rakish.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.337
Rocco, I don't know as well.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.465
He's, uh, harder to gauge.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.550
More your age.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.344
-
More forward-looking.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.055
Yeah, I would love to.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.474
It's a personal service.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.186
They are paying us to...

03:48.186 --> 03:52.106
be at the end of a phone,
to take them out for dinner...

03:53.149 --> 03:54.275
to make them feel safe.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.110
Investment returns

03:56.194 --> 03:58.613
are as steady and as boring
as a savings account.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.239
But...

04:00.323 --> 04:02.533
...a savings account
does not come with us.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.997
I have to say...

04:08.957 --> 04:10.333
I love your shoes.

04:11.709 --> 04:12.961
Client favorite.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.891
The company is Rican Healthcare.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.310
Leader in
the telemedicine space.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.728
Last year created a need--

04:30.812 --> 04:32.814
Pricey healthcare
subscription service.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.565
Remote doctors.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.109
Helps rich people
get medical access without...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.944
...leaving
their Chelsea Mews house.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.487
A consortium of PE firms

04:39.487 --> 04:40.989
provided rescue financing
to them

04:40.989 --> 04:42.198
at the peak of the pandemic.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.783
Now, we have
exclusively negotiated

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
with one of these firms
to acquire their blocks

04:45.410 --> 04:47.662
at three percent discount
and place it with our clients.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.913
So, as of now.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.375
I'm the proud owner of
75 million shares of Rican.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.752
As handsome
and inspirational as I am,

04:54.836 --> 04:57.380
I'm not a captain of industry.
I'm a market maker.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.340
So, sadly, I'm not looking
to keep the shares--

04:59.424 --> 05:00.466
You're looking to flip them?

05:00.550 --> 05:02.176
You're not
a total lost cause after all.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.929
Thanks for joining us!

05:06.431 --> 05:08.224
Yeah, uh, the lock-up period
has just ended.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.475
So your clients should know that

05:09.559 --> 05:11.561
this is the best opportunity
since Rican went public

05:11.561 --> 05:13.688
to obtain a block of shares
and get in on the story.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.900
Danny, can you pass out
the deal sheets?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.365
Yeah.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.453
So, here is a list
of significant investors

05:28.453 --> 05:30.872
that have expressed interest
in either the name...

05:31.706 --> 05:32.874
or the sector.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.501
There you go.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.297
Remember,
this isn't an IPO.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.841
There won't be
a month-long roadshow

05:41.841 --> 05:44.427
to drum up interest.
No batting of eyelashes.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.722
We have less than 24 hours
to build the book

05:47.722 --> 05:50.016
and <i>adios</i> the full position
out the door.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.476
I'm happy to quarterback
on this one.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.064
Felim Bichan
is the anchor of the deal, so...

05:56.064 --> 05:57.732
- that's my client.
- Right.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.110
The anchor is, uh,
<i>numero</i> one on the deal sheet.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.528
Takes the largest chunk
of shares.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.239
- Do you have to keep doing that?
Between us, I, um...

06:05.323 --> 06:07.200
I think the kid's got
a minor brain injury.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.203
-
- Fuck off, you Canada Goose nonce.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.540
Eric, did Felim reconfirm
at breakfast?

06:14.624 --> 06:17.460
The I-bankers upstairs
who built the book
are happy with Felim as anchor.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.544
But have also identified

06:18.628 --> 06:20.129
Anna Gearing
at FutureDawn Partners

06:20.213 --> 06:21.464
as a specialist in the sector.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.675
- ESG fund. Social impact.
- One of the good guys.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.552
It would behoove us
to know where Anna stands.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.388
Who has the CPS relationship
with FutureDawn?

06:29.472 --> 06:33.392
The deal sheet says
“Daria Greenock.”

06:33.476 --> 06:36.687
- I knew her, Horatio.
- That deal sheet is out of date.

06:36.771 --> 06:40.108
If it's Daria's slack,
I will look into Anna.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.276
Right, yeah, please.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.362
It's critical
her interest is firm.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.697
Her fund is one of the most
clued up in the space.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.117
They lead. People follow.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.451
Now without her the deal's DOA.

06:50.535 --> 06:54.539
Let's not give New York
an easy win by fucking this up.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.541
<i>Vamos!</i>

07:01.379 --> 07:03.506
Yo, you ever met
that Felim geezer?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.883
I tried to take him whoring
once after a client dinner,

07:05.967 --> 07:07.385
and he looked at me,
like I'm some...

07:07.385 --> 07:08.845
I'm really sorry
that I missed breakfast.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.305
I fucked up.
But I want to be honest.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.431
Try it out.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.602
I went to go see Bloom speak
at a town hall.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.647
I mean, speak is a bit kind,
he bloviated.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.984
It was a distraction.
You were right.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.819
I'll call Felim
with a credible excuse.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.363
How was it?

07:27.363 --> 07:28.698
Did he confirm tomorrow
as the anchor?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.658
Don't do that. I don't want you
calling him anymore.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.702
Actually, let's be unequivocal.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.330
You are not to call Felim,
and if he calls the desk,

07:36.414 --> 07:39.709
you're not to answer.
You set a meeting...

07:39.709 --> 07:43.129
with a sensitive client
and bailed.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.049
Forget bad business practice,
that's bad manners, straight up.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.468
For a third-year analyst,

07:50.136 --> 07:51.554
I gave you

07:51.554 --> 07:56.434
a super-privileged position
and you shit the bed.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.231
How can you even ask
for a sales credit split?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.652
I tell you,
ladies and gentlemen,

08:06.736 --> 08:09.697
this morning,
I am horny for flow.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.157
I am horny for your mum!

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
Are you sure you're an intern?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.035
Yeah, I know.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.370
Might as well
call me Jerome Powell,

08:16.454 --> 08:18.164
'cause I'm the fucking market!

08:19.207 --> 08:21.375
Big 24 hours ahead of us.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.835
Why are you late?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.587
I had a meeting.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.964
With a saleswoman
in Private Wealth Management.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.134
Speaking of which,
how is Denise?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.137
Are you okay?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.972
I did a rotation
in PWM

08:35.056 --> 08:37.225
during my spring week
at Credit Suisse.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.353
It was so... frothy.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.521
Acronym. “Pussy's wet, mister!”

08:44.941 --> 08:46.025
Kenny's late.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.693
Kenny's in a breakfast meeting

08:47.777 --> 08:50.071
with an actual FX client!

08:54.367 --> 08:57.828
Look, I'm happy to give you
special privileges given our...

08:57.912 --> 09:00.289
you know,
daedalian complications,

09:00.373 --> 09:02.124
but don't take the piss.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.460
I was looking up
different parts of the bank.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.878
You know, “One Pierpoint.”

09:05.962 --> 09:08.297
Plots. Schemes.
Career machinations, whatever.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.259
File them all away under
“Not on my time.”

09:11.259 --> 09:12.969
So, Venetia, how old were you

09:12.969 --> 09:14.428
when you rode your first pony?

09:14.512 --> 09:15.805
That's not a euphemism.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.598
I'm asking when daddy got you
into the saddle, again, not...

09:17.682 --> 09:18.641
Have you, uh,

09:18.641 --> 09:20.851
touched base
with Anna Gearing recently?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.729
- No. Why?
Um, palace intrigue.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.564
Lots of whispers of her name
on the floor

09:25.648 --> 09:27.984
re the CPS equity deal
happening tomorrow.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.944
I heard Anna's fund
moved to Berlin?

09:29.944 --> 09:33.281
- Brexit exodus. Brexidous.
- Yep. German husband.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.657
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.158
Presumably, perfect
Aryan kids though.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.661
- So, swings and roundabouts.
- Boudicea and Olympia.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.870
How do you know that?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.331
I asked.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.542
Look I know I was
probably born behind the curve,

09:44.542 --> 09:45.710
but if anything comes in

09:45.710 --> 09:48.087
from anywhere
on Gearing, deal with it.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.423
It's an equity block
but she's still an FX client

09:50.423 --> 09:52.133
and we need to at least
seem to know

09:52.133 --> 09:53.718
what business she's doing
with this bank.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.387
You want us
coordinating with CPS?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.557
Fuck me sideways. God is dead.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.019
We few, we few,
we happy few.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.979
We band of brothers.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.355
Hi, Anna.
This is Harper Stern

10:06.439 --> 10:08.232
- from Pierpoint.
<i>Who?</i>

10:08.316 --> 10:10.192
I was Daria Greenock's
backup coverage.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.360
<i>Oh, right. Yeah.</i>

10:11.444 --> 10:13.362
<i>I tend to deal with
your FX Desk now.</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:14.363
<i>They do my hedging.</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:16.282
Sure, um,
I was meaning to talk to you

10:16.282 --> 10:17.658
about an upcoming equity block--

10:17.742 --> 10:19.035
<i>Sorry,
but I don't know who you are,</i>

10:19.035 --> 10:21.704
<i>so why would I talk
to you about it? Take care.</i>

10:26.709 --> 10:28.586
Let me know
when you've connected with Anna.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.006
When I have something material,
I will let you know.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.886
Sorry. That...
That could've been an email.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.721
I... I was--

10:38.721 --> 10:40.264
Never mind.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.099
You got any package, huh?
-

10:42.183 --> 10:44.018
And I'll tell you,
that fruity little nonce,

10:44.018 --> 10:46.812
was absolutely seething it.
And it wasn't even hot...

10:46.896 --> 10:48.731
Hey, where are you--
Where are you from?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.817
Uh, Upstate New York.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.611
- Binghamton.
- Oh!

10:54.403 --> 10:56.572
- You?
- The... the city.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.366
- Actually, Upper West Side.
- Hmm.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.784
- Oh!
- Yeah.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.537
- "Van Deventer."
-

11:03.621 --> 11:05.122
That doesn't sound very Black.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.209
-
- Well, nor does Stern, so...

11:10.086 --> 11:11.754
Yo!
Felim is banging the line...

11:11.754 --> 11:13.339
- Is that the anchor?
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
Pick it up.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.096
Pick up the phone.
It's the deal anchor.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.305
You have
the relationship, right?

11:21.389 --> 11:24.475
I do, but Eric very explicitly
took me off the account.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.062
Where's Eric?

11:28.062 --> 11:31.399
He's taken an inopportune time
to void his bowls.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.858
His diet must be very fibrous

11:32.942 --> 11:34.652
because it keeps
Seiko-quality time. So--

11:34.652 --> 11:37.071
He's taking
the brutal shittings.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.406
You're banned
from ten-minute turds.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.574
Good, it's a crime scene
in there.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.285
- The size of those things...
- Answer the phone.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.454
Thanks.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.833
- Good morning. Harper speaking.
<i>Good morning.</i>

11:48.833 --> 11:51.001
<i>Sorry to have
missed you earlier.</i>

11:51.085 --> 11:52.461
- My apologies for that.
<i>Nae bother.</i>

11:52.545 --> 11:55.297
<i>So, run me through the deal.
How's the book shaping up?</i>

11:55.381 --> 11:57.675
Uh, it's building nicely.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.468
Almost covered.
We're just waiting on some

11:59.552 --> 12:01.387
sector specialists
to confirm participation.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.888
<i>How do you mean
“almost covered?”</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:04.140
<i>I was assured plainly</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:06.142
<i>that Anna had done the work
and it was in the book.</i>

12:06.142 --> 12:07.685
I'm sure that
that's just timing.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.645
I'm told that this deal
will come cheap to comps

12:09.645 --> 12:11.814
- and trade well in the breaks.
<i>I couldn't give a hoot</i>

12:11.814 --> 12:13.107
<i>that the sellers
are eager to sell.</i>

12:13.107 --> 12:14.608
Two pounds lighter, lad. Yeah?
- Sure.

12:14.692 --> 12:15.943
<i>If Anna's not participating</i>

12:15.943 --> 12:17.361
<i>then I'm not gonna anchor it.</i>

12:17.445 --> 12:19.238
<i>And Pierpoint have a dead deal,
understood?</i>

12:19.238 --> 12:21.198
<i>- You know, frankly, Harper...</i>
- Felim, if you could just--

12:21.282 --> 12:22.825
<i>...this isn't the news
I was expecting.</i>

12:22.825 --> 12:24.618
<i>Particularly from
someone so junior</i>

12:24.702 --> 12:27.246
<i>and marketing
one of her first block trades.</i>

12:29.415 --> 12:31.459
Anraj,
you cannot fucking talk.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.752
Yours rival Celine,
a distressed debt trader.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.173
About four foot.
Very avian. Very French.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.092
Let me tell you, mortar shits.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.011
Blitzkrieg and hellfire.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.179
You know when she's been in

12:43.179 --> 12:44.889
because the cleaners went in
straight after...

12:44.889 --> 12:46.557
-
Felim.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.688
Felim... look, if these are
pre-match jitters,

12:52.688 --> 12:55.649
let's work it all through.
Call me coach. Let--

12:58.194 --> 13:01.030
Trust me.
Anna has already done the work.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
She already owns the name.

13:03.032 --> 13:07.703
She was a size buyer post-IPO
and she is gonna add.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.538
It's not a matter of if.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.998
It's a question
of how many boots

13:10.998 --> 13:12.833
she has to fill.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.461
‘Cause the lady
is filling her fucking boots,

13:15.461 --> 13:16.587
let me tell you.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.925
She's in.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.307
You know, I can't do that
over the phone.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.558
You have to trust me.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.781
What did you do?
He just pulled his order.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.660
I didn't tell him anything

13:47.660 --> 13:49.370
that wasn't
in the talking points.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.289
I gave him
the shape of the book.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.542
See?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.002
Cause, you don't listen.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.297
Effect, needless work.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.174
Look, why are you
balling her out?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.760
It's not her fault
you don't communicate with her.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.012
Oh. Why would you misrepresent

14:07.096 --> 14:09.473
Anna's interest in the deal
to Felim?

14:09.557 --> 14:12.101
- I am doing our job.
Right.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.771
Our job is to help people
make the decision

14:15.771 --> 14:17.523
that we know they need to make,

14:17.523 --> 14:19.900
often much faster than
they're comfortable making it.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
Anna will come into this book.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.862
The deal has
the right characteristics.

14:23.946 --> 14:28.909
Sellers, discount, upside.
The stock will trade higher.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.870
And Felim would have called me

14:31.954 --> 14:34.540
and said, “Eric,
what was I worried about?”

14:34.540 --> 14:37.751
People are just
knots of fear, okay?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.628
We loosen them, we win.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.506
This isn't Utopia. This is par.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.134
It's how it plays,

14:45.134 --> 14:48.387
- if we just do our fucking job.
- Guys, guys, look respectfully,

14:48.387 --> 14:49.972
you're running this
like a circus.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.767
You don't mean it respectfully,
so don't say “respectfully.”

14:53.851 --> 14:55.436
New York was
a democracy of competency.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.646
We held each other accountable.
We managed up with that.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.065
You are no longer in New York.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.317
And there was talk
about this,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.737
but hell,
this is the rumor made flesh.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.407
You cross the Rubicon with me,
it's goodnight, Vienna.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.659
In no uncertain terms.
You fucking follow?

15:12.786 --> 15:14.622
- Yeah.
Yo! Lads and lasses!

15:14.622 --> 15:17.249
Please, for the love of God,
don't tell me this book
is falling apart.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.878
I'm leveraged enough
that even someone as dodgy as me

15:20.878 --> 15:23.255
- couldn't hide the losses.
- It's under control.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.465
I'm calling Anna.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.426
Watch me do your jobs.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.476
Eric Tao for Anna.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.688
What do you mean
she's not taking any more calls?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.273
She's in the calls business.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.364
Honestly,
fucking salespeople.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.157
If we can't move
this pot of block,

15:50.157 --> 15:52.743
I am gonna personally bowcat
all your mothers.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.370
This hurts my cock.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.622
Diana is a lot of things,
but number one,

15:56.622 --> 15:59.500
she's very fucking expensive.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.919
You know her old fella's
best mates with Farage?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.962
Yasmin, do you have
a relationship

16:04.046 --> 16:06.006
with Anna Gearing at FDP?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.716
He is gonna look at me
at the altar

16:07.800 --> 16:09.593
and do that
Basil Fawlty double take.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.062
- Good morning.
<i>My desk needs to get</i>

16:20.062 --> 16:21.397
in touch with her urgently.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.482
<i>It's always urgent.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:25.359
<i>I've been doing
some hedging for her</i>

16:25.359 --> 16:26.443
<i>- in lieu of Kenny.</i>
- Okay.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.820
Do you have enough of
a relationship

16:27.820 --> 16:28.821
that you could vouch for me?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.280
She's not going
to tell you anything

16:30.364 --> 16:31.740
- if she doesn't know you.
<i>Okay, that's fine.</i>

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
I will deal with that.
Can you just make the connect?

16:35.411 --> 16:36.829
Come on,
this is critical business.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.914
<i>Is there a patient
dying on a table somewhere?</i>

16:38.914 --> 16:41.375
Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.763
Whatever your little issue is
with me,

16:54.847 --> 16:56.932
it could cost the firm
a fuck ton of dollars.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.393
Maybe you should
think about that then.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.937
Our CPS team are dealing
with the Rican Health block,

17:01.937 --> 17:04.773
but they're a fucking circus.
I'll keep you posted...

17:04.857 --> 17:06.984
-
Unbelievable.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.653
What a little drama queen.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.947
I've you some krone
movement down the back there.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.949
Why is the air conditioning

17:13.949 --> 17:15.743
so fucking cold?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.119
- So, listen--
- Do you remember

17:17.119 --> 17:20.205
the day I did this?
You were so young.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.625
Fuck, what year was it?

17:23.709 --> 17:27.546
- It's one long blur.
- Not that young. Just 24.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.214
You were so fucking angry
with me.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.092
Yeah. Yeah.
I spent a lot of money on it.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.635
Relatively.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.095
I can't believe
you never said anything to me

17:35.179 --> 17:38.015
when I was wearing a fucking
Hermès tie on the floor.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.266
It was my first trade.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.773
Old school bullshit.
You still wear two-tone shirts.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.524
You know that was the, um--

17:47.608 --> 17:49.401
That was the first night
we got drunk together.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.282
Put it back on.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.999
You know, candidly, I heard
a little bit about you two.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.045
People are complex, but, uh...

18:08.045 --> 18:10.839
when these things
become more material...

18:10.923 --> 18:13.675
i.e., they look likely
to cost the desk dollars...

18:14.593 --> 18:16.178
I feel obliged to say something.

18:16.178 --> 18:20.098
I knew you before your face
was troubled by a razor.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.685
Okay. We done?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.270
I really think
Adler would like to see

18:25.354 --> 18:28.023
some of that aggression
channeled into driving business.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.318
- Just say what you're saying.
- The data speaks for itself.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.529
You've had
a couple soft quarters.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.781
One is a pass.
Two could be terminal.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.327
The desk has, or Eric has?

18:40.327 --> 18:41.537
I know Felim was central

18:41.537 --> 18:43.914
to whatever halo
Adler may have put on you.

18:43.914 --> 18:46.375
So, it's best to
keep him happy, no?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.919
Okay, so pragmatically,

18:48.919 --> 18:50.504
the six inches
in front of our face.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.631
How do we resecure the anchor

18:52.631 --> 18:56.176
and not take a huge bath
on a 3.3-billion-dollar deal?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.636
Let me work Felim.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.098
I've talked him
on to and off enough ledges.

19:01.098 --> 19:05.144
In the spirit of pragmatism,
Harper is a third-year analyst

19:05.144 --> 19:07.604
and she knows
to get the fuck out of our way

19:07.688 --> 19:08.605
on stuff that carries

19:08.689 --> 19:10.440
high reputational
or financial risk.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.900
You know, there's more
to good communication

19:11.984 --> 19:14.695
- than just talking a lot?
- She's a third year.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.823
She has zero value
to a client without me.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.701
And you have
unearned management pretensions

19:20.701 --> 19:23.036
that sound pathetic to my ear.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.538
Hey, Eric.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.709
Eric, you know, I've always
considered you a mentor,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.544
so, everything I'm saying,

19:30.544 --> 19:32.045
I'm saying
with my cap in my hand.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.592
I am going
to fucking cut you open

19:36.592 --> 19:37.718
and climb inside you

19:37.718 --> 19:39.052
- if you don't sort this...
- Right.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.265
I need you to know,

19:43.265 --> 19:45.225
that he and I do not have
the kind of relationship

19:45.309 --> 19:46.810
that people are saying
that we have.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.563
Hey, why don't you
concentrate on

19:49.563 --> 19:51.732
making people realize
that you're here for...

19:51.732 --> 19:54.484
your talent, rather than
because your boss likes you.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.528
Okay?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.911
So, we have
a block of Rican Health to go?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.580
Nah, it's not really my sector
when I dabble in equities.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.124
Any FX plays off its back?

20:09.124 --> 20:11.835
- Uh, let me get back to you.
Anraj!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.462
<i>Oh, right. Yeah.</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:15.505
The age-old salesman response

20:15.589 --> 20:17.215
<i>when he has no idea
how to answer.</i>

20:17.299 --> 20:19.134
- Nicole...
Don't talk back to me,

20:19.134 --> 20:21.053
- get me my lunch.
- ...I'm just a kid, all right.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.931
- I have no fucking clue.
- Well, how refreshing.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.474
Oh, and I love the way you, uh,

20:25.474 --> 20:28.185
<i>you presuppose
that I'm going to deal with you</i>

20:28.185 --> 20:29.394
<i>without ever meeting you.</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:31.396
Well, I'd never be
so presumptuous.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.940
No, I save
that kind of entitlement

20:32.940 --> 20:34.816
for the chins you marched over
on your way up.

Oh, yeah!
Use my ass! Use my ass!

37:24.450 --> 37:26.953
I'm... I'm just not
feeling it anymore, sorry.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.502
- A bit of a tease, aren't you?
- Sorry.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.629

gacked up now.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.839
Fuck sake.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.439
They both left in a hurry.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.112

I definitely did.

38:02.279 --> 38:04.198

somewhere between the...

38:05.157 --> 38:06.742
cab and the front door.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.703
It was such a relief
he just left.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.040

38:18.713 --> 38:21.757

it's a tough diagnosis.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.436

You're the bane

38:42.111 --> 38:43.112
I'm joking.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.409
I-- I'm joking. Okay, um...

38:48.409 --> 38:51.620
I'm going to give you something
I got a lot growing up.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.539
Um...

38:55.708 --> 38:57.543
You are good.

38:58.669 --> 38:59.837
You are worthy.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.548
Take what you deserve.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.635
Benefits of a--
a very expensive education.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.387
Point is...

41:31.155 --> 41:33.490
The amount of drop-shots

42:12.029 --> 42:14.156

42:14.240 --> 42:17.201
Sorry. I can imagine
what this looks like.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.245
But, uh, you did say
where you were gonna be--

42:19.245 --> 42:20.454
Okay. Can you not?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.997
Because that's
borderline behavior.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.582
You asked

42:23.666 --> 42:25.542

You know, during the gold rush

42:32.633 --> 42:35.386
all the gold miners
actually went bust?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.513

these vaccine plays.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.349
The gold, which is actually
not worth that much.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.103
I'm interested in
the picks and the shovels.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.689

they were the ones
who came out on top.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.320

Not yet confirmed.

43:16.802 --> 43:18.470
But looks likely.
She already owns it.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.680
Is looking to add.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.057
Nobody's participating
without a specialist interest.

three-percent discount

49:41.812 --> 49:43.146
because you assured us,

49:43.230 --> 49:44.356
you had a concrete home
for the paper.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.857
- He will call. Trust me.
Yeah, all right.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.984
But there was a time when
I would've taken that as gospel.

49:48.068 --> 49:48.902
Look, I don't...

49:48.902 --> 49:50.320
I don't deal in the subjunctive.

49:50.404 --> 49:51.738
Conditional.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.907
Conditional. Whatever fucking
tense that is, okay?

49:53.907 --> 49:55.033
We open in 12 minutes.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.953
My budget on this book
is a hundred million.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.162
A hundred bars!

49:59.246 --> 50:00.914
Okay, I'm simply not taking
a wash on half of that.

50:00.914 --> 50:03.417
Losing fifty fucking bars?
No way.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.710
I'm not being made
to look a cunt

50:04.710 --> 50:06.837
because you guys can't do
the primary schoolwork

50:06.837 --> 50:08.088
of placing stock.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.215
- Rish, he's gonna call.
Eric!

50:10.215 --> 50:12.843
It's all right to act alpha
when we deliver alpha.

50:12.843 --> 50:17.139
Okay, but this is cuck behavior.
And I do not like cuckoldry.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.432
Okay. Okay. Look.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.308
Let's operate from this basis.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.269
Felim is out.
Anna's unresponsive.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.521
Rishi is about to get hung
with a block of paper.

50:24.521 --> 50:26.606
What's the strategy
if we leap from there?

50:27.983 --> 50:28.984
Harper?

50:28.984 --> 50:30.485
You're working on
some kind of insurance?

50:30.569 --> 50:32.028
This should be good.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.322
Nothing came of it.

50:34.948 --> 50:36.366
Uh, what even was it?

50:38.535 --> 50:41.580
Jesse Bloom.
Um, I met him.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.999
And he said he wanted
more exposure

50:43.999 --> 50:45.083
in the healthcare space.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.753
Honestly, fuck this.
Fuck you. Fuck off.

50:47.753 --> 50:51.256
If this hurts my compensation
or pushes me out the door,

50:51.256 --> 50:52.632
I'm dragging you all
down with me.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.050
Bunch of fuck faces!

50:54.134 --> 50:56.970
Harper, maybe after
you've gotten through to Bloom,

50:56.970 --> 51:00.432
you can try Bill Ackman next.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.100
Or one of the Gettys.

51:02.184 --> 51:04.102
In a situation as dicey as this,

51:04.186 --> 51:06.062
let's try not to waste time,
okay?

51:06.146 --> 51:07.564
We're collapsing
in the pre-market!

51:07.564 --> 51:09.608
I don't have the lines
to hold this much size.

51:09.608 --> 51:13.320
The bell rings in five minutes.
Get me a home for the paper!

51:13.320 --> 51:15.280
- Felim's gonna call.
He's not. Accept it.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.990
I didn't know this desk
ran on blind faith.

51:16.990 --> 51:18.909
It doesn't!
I know him. You don't.

51:18.909 --> 51:19.910
Okay.
- He's gonna call.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.203
Four minutes!
-

51:21.203 --> 51:22.704
I puke this paper
into the market,

51:22.788 --> 51:25.165
eat the loss
and never forgive any of you.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.750
Rish--
Who is it?

51:26.750 --> 51:27.918
Unknown number.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.170
Felim?

51:37.803 --> 51:38.845
It's for you.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.687
<i>Hi, Harper.
It's Jesse Bloom.</i>

51:47.771 --> 51:48.980
Hi, Jesse.

51:49.064 --> 51:50.982
<i>I'm sick of commenting
on the direction of the wind.</i>

51:51.066 --> 51:52.317
<i>Shall we make it blow?</i>

51:52.317 --> 51:53.401
I don't follow.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.823
Let's find out
how essential you are.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.366
<i>What have you learned about
our friend Anna</i>

51:59.366 --> 52:00.534
<i>and her interest?</i>

52:00.534 --> 52:02.452
Uh, I'm close. I'm close.
Do you mind holding?

52:05.539 --> 52:07.040
Yas, I know, that I always say

52:07.040 --> 52:08.291
that “this is
a matter of urgency”

52:08.375 --> 52:10.168
but this really is
a matter of urgency.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.295
I'm really sorry that I'm always
in such a rush with you

52:12.379 --> 52:14.214
but I really need your help.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.216
I need access to Anna. Now.

52:16.216 --> 52:19.386
It's just a tickle,
99 percent sure it's not COVID.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.805
-

52:23.723 --> 52:26.059
<i>Yasmin!
Good to hear from you.</i>

52:26.059 --> 52:28.311
<i>- I miss having our natters.</i>
- Same, same.

52:28.395 --> 52:30.438
Let's book a phenomenal
comp night out soon.

52:30.522 --> 52:32.357
<i>Fine.
But you choose the place.</i>

52:32.357 --> 52:33.692
<i>I never get these things right.</i>

52:33.692 --> 52:34.818
Look, I know you don't like

52:34.818 --> 52:36.027
speaking to people
you don't know,

52:36.111 --> 52:38.405
but I have Harper Stern
from Cross Product Sales

52:38.405 --> 52:39.531
and I can vouch for her.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.991
Will you give her
two ticks for me.

52:40.991 --> 52:44.411
<i>Tell her I'm busy.
She can have one tick max.</i>

52:44.953 --> 52:46.705
Anna's on.

52:46.705 --> 52:48.665
You have no idea
how much I appreciate this.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.250
It's just business, Harper.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.544
<i>Where are we?
Coffee's getting cold.</i>

52:52.544 --> 52:55.672
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
Can you just hold one sec.

52:56.882 --> 52:58.592
- Anna, hi.
<i>Yep, quickly.</i>

52:58.592 --> 53:00.969
<i>Fair warning. I'm not talking
about any imminent biz,</i>

53:00.969 --> 53:02.929
<i>but happy to field
a quick question</i>

53:03.013 --> 53:04.014
<i>as a favor to Yasmin.</i>

53:04.014 --> 53:07.142
Yes. We have
a mismatched FX trade

53:07.142 --> 53:08.435
that my back office
is having trouble

53:08.435 --> 53:10.437
getting in contact
with yours to confirm.

53:10.437 --> 53:13.023
We booked Pierpoint buys
250 mil quid

53:13.023 --> 53:16.943
- at 136.62, value spot.
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

53:17.027 --> 53:19.321
<i>The direction is right
but the notional is wrong.</i>

53:19.321 --> 53:22.240
<i>I specifically bought
250 million dollars</i>

53:22.324 --> 53:23.783
<i>which I intend to put to work.</i>

53:23.867 --> 53:26.077
Anna, I'm so sorry. False alarm.
Um, you are right.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.205
Pierpoint did sell dollars
in your amount at that rate.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.207
<i>No problem.
These things happen.</i>

53:33.043 --> 53:35.629
Anna isn't in the book yet.
But she is buying at the open.

53:36.963 --> 53:37.964
How can you be sure?

53:38.048 --> 53:39.549
Her flagship fund
is sterling denominated,

53:39.633 --> 53:42.469
and when she wants
to buy a US asset
she has to raise the dollars.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.304
She's going to use it
to buy the stock. Guaranteed.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.514
<i>Okay. How much stock
does your trader have now?</i>

53:46.598 --> 53:47.933
<i>- And where is it?</i>
- How much do you have

53:47.933 --> 53:49.309
- and what's the offer?
<i>Harper!</i>

53:49.309 --> 53:51.895
If you click me out
of a phone call while executing,

53:51.895 --> 53:53.480
<i>you will never
hear from me again.</i>

53:53.480 --> 53:54.940
I'm stuck with 50 million.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.566
The last trade price was 45.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.610
I can sell you
all 50 million at that price.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.612
All right. Tell him I know
his order book is fucked

54:00.612 --> 54:02.113
and the market opens
in 30 seconds.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.783
<i>I will take 50 million
at 44, not 45.</i>

54:04.783 --> 54:07.577
- He's running you over.
- Rishi, he's 44 bid.

54:07.661 --> 54:08.745
Forty-four? Is he mad?

54:08.745 --> 54:10.080
This is the best name
in the sector.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.873
And it's already at a discount!
My price is 45.

54:11.957 --> 54:14.960
Tell him if he likes it so much,
he can fucking keep it.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.128
He says if you like it so much,
then you can keep it.

54:17.212 --> 54:18.546
<i>"Fucking keep it," I said!</i>

54:18.630 --> 54:20.799
He says if you like it so much
then you can fucking keep it.

54:20.799 --> 54:22.676
He can have all 50 million
at 44 and three quarters.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.511
- That's my final offer.
<i>How about this?</i>

54:25.929 --> 54:27.722
I'll buy 75 million. Not 50.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.601
Seventy-five million
at 44 and a half.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.187
Seventy-five? I've only got 50!
This will take me short.

54:34.187 --> 54:35.981
- No, fuck that.
- Okay, Jesse, how about this.

54:35.981 --> 54:37.315
Why don't we do 50 now,

54:37.399 --> 54:40.944
and we'll leave a working order
for 25 more after the open?

54:46.908 --> 54:47.993
That works.

54:47.993 --> 54:49.411
Limit 44 and three quarters.

54:49.411 --> 54:50.912
<i>Twenty percent of the ADV.</i>

54:50.996 --> 54:52.664
Fifty million
at 44 and three quarters.

54:52.664 --> 54:55.125
Anraj, we got an order for
25 million more in the open.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.292
I want you managing it.

54:56.376 --> 54:57.711
Say less, squire.
It will be done, sir.

54:57.711 --> 54:59.963
That's 50 million
at 44 and three quarters.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.047
Yours.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.842
Fifty million
at 44 and three quarters. Done.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.468
<i>Mine.</i>

55:07.595 --> 55:08.888
Who taught you to fish?

55:11.224 --> 55:14.352
Hey! Really good shit!

55:14.436 --> 55:16.354
Really good fucking shit, Harper.

55:29.451 --> 55:31.327
Eric,
got Felim on line one!

55:31.411 --> 55:33.913
Tell him he's in a queue now
and his order will have to wait.
