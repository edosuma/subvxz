01:03.046 --> 01:04.166
Attention!

01:15.806 --> 01:19.006
Abbot! Where in hell
have you been?!Rome!

01:19.046 --> 01:22.486
How dare you summon me to your
quarters like a common serf?

01:22.526 --> 01:24.286
My Lord, I need you.

01:24.326 --> 01:26.846
But it couldn't
wait until tomorrow?

01:26.886 --> 01:29.406
No.

01:29.446 --> 01:31.686
It's too late for absolution.

01:33.486 --> 01:35.566
You're the only one who can...

01:35.606 --> 01:40.366
who can help me now. If you are truly
willing to repent for all your sins...I am.

01:40.406 --> 01:45.286
Then you must make your peace with God,
my son, and pray for His forgiveness.

01:45.326 --> 01:50.406
Ah, well, you see, it's not God I'm
worried about... it's Prince John.

01:51.566 --> 01:53.526
Then you really are in trouble.

01:53.566 --> 01:56.046
He already has Gisborne.

01:56.086 --> 01:57.966
And it's anyone's guess
what he's doing with him.

01:58.006 --> 02:02.326
Well, knowing the Prince as I
do, my advice is this. Please him.

02:02.366 --> 02:05.246
Please him?

02:05.286 --> 02:09.006
What do you think I've
been doing all this time?!

02:09.045 --> 02:12.126
Weaving tapestries?!

02:12.166 --> 02:13.686
Look.

02:13.726 --> 02:17.726
I have to execute Hood within one
month, otherwise I'm horse-meat.

02:17.766 --> 02:20.846
Well, I really don't see what you
expect me to do about Robin Hood.

02:20.886 --> 02:24.646
Now, I've had a very long journey,
I need to return to my Abbey, so

02:24.686 --> 02:29.966
if there's nothing else I will bid
you good night.Not so fast, Abbot.

02:32.806 --> 02:34.646
You will assist me.

02:36.886 --> 02:39.126
Why on earth would I do that?

02:43.726 --> 02:47.246
Because... I know
your little secrets!

02:47.286 --> 02:49.446
Where did you get it?

02:49.486 --> 02:53.446
When I was looking for you at the Abbey
I decided to do some nosing around.

02:53.486 --> 02:55.086
So you think you can blackmail me?

02:55.126 --> 03:01.086
Mmm... amazing how great
men, no matter how revered,

03:01.126 --> 03:05.926
always have some explosive little nugget hidden
away ready for someone like me to find, hmm?

03:05.966 --> 03:10.846
And as little nuggets go this
is as explosive as it gets.

03:10.886 --> 03:15.126
Abbot, even I was shocked.
Now you listen to me!

03:15.166 --> 03:16.846
No! You listen to me!

03:16.886 --> 03:21.726
You will use all your power and
your influence, you will use the full

03:21.766 --> 03:25.526
might of the Church to help me finish
off Robin Hood once and for all,

03:25.566 --> 03:29.126
or it'll be your head on the
chopping block with mine. Got it?!

04:11.126 --> 04:13.406
You know this is
my favourite thing.

04:13.446 --> 04:15.726
The handing out of parcels.

04:15.766 --> 04:19.846
Being welcomed into the village
like sons returning from battle.

04:21.805 --> 04:24.606
It's better to give
than to receive.

04:28.886 --> 04:32.126
You're an educated man, who said "It
is better to give than to receive"?

04:32.166 --> 04:34.886
Oh, it's nobody important, just
some carpenter from Nazareth.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.406
Oh. Him!

04:39.966 --> 04:41.806
Get down! Get down!

04:41.846 --> 04:43.446
It's the Sheriff.

05:14.566 --> 05:20.766
Last night, the Abbot of Kirklees
came to me and asked for my assistance.

05:20.806 --> 05:22.966
It has come to pass

05:23.006 --> 05:32.926
that Robin Hood and his gang of feral
unwashed pustules have stolen from the Church.

05:33.246 --> 05:35.806
Eh?

05:35.846 --> 05:37.406
What's he talking about?

05:41.046 --> 05:42.846
I know

05:42.886 --> 05:45.006
that you know Robin Hood.

05:45.046 --> 05:47.406
I know that some of you

05:47.446 --> 05:50.046
have come to look upon him
as a friend. Don't be fooled.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.806
Since his return from his travels,

05:55.846 --> 05:58.246
Hood has become a Satanic killer.

05:59.806 --> 06:04.566
And anybody harbouring him should
be damned to a heretic's death.

06:04.606 --> 06:06.086
At the stake...

06:08.326 --> 06:12.166
where their flesh should
be charred from their bones.

06:15.606 --> 06:18.566
Now, the Abbey is
under my protection.

06:18.606 --> 06:23.246
I've thrown a cordon around it
and tripled security just in case

06:23.286 --> 06:26.046
Hood tries to steal again.

06:29.006 --> 06:32.886
If this village does not assist
me in capturing Robin Hood,

06:32.926 --> 06:36.366
then it shall be deemed
infected with evil

06:36.406 --> 06:42.726
and it shall be wiped clean
of every living creature.

06:47.086 --> 06:52.526
By the power vested in me by
His Holiness Pope Celestine III,

06:52.566 --> 06:55.006
I issue this holy edict.

06:55.046 --> 07:05.006
It's every man, woman and child's sacred duty
to help bring the demon Robin Hood to justice!

07:05.046 --> 07:06.686
This is bad.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.686
This is very bad.

07:08.726 --> 07:11.646
This is not good!

07:11.686 --> 07:15.166
It wasn't me. I wasn't anywhere
near the Abbey last night.

07:15.206 --> 07:16.846
Don't you understand?

07:16.886 --> 07:20.206
The Abbot has damned
our souls forever!

07:20.246 --> 07:23.166
All right, all right,
less of the forever.

07:23.206 --> 07:25.486
Why would the Abbot do this?

07:25.526 --> 07:27.046
Only one way to find out.

07:27.086 --> 07:28.966
No, no no...

07:29.006 --> 07:31.166
Come on, Robin, we have to
confront the Abbot, right now!

07:31.206 --> 07:35.766
Challenge him. We need to understand why he
did this. What hold the Sheriffhas over him.

07:35.806 --> 07:38.846
If we attack the Abbey now it'll
just confirm the Sheriff's lies.

07:38.886 --> 07:41.366
Well, then, what do you
suggest we do about it?

07:41.406 --> 07:42.926
We go to the people.Ah...

07:42.966 --> 07:46.606
We go to the people and show
them we're still on their side.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.886
We trust the people to
make up their own minds.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.406
Robin, the people fear and love
the Church in equal measure.

07:51.446 --> 07:55.406
Tuck's right. They'll never believe
us over the Abbot!Well, we'll see.

07:57.486 --> 08:00.406
I can't understand this. This is one of
the finest scholars of his generation.

08:00.446 --> 08:05.526
He's spent his entire life crusading
for justice, searching for truth...

08:05.566 --> 08:07.646
Obviously there's something more
precious to him than the truth.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.246
Yes, and I need to
find out what that is.

08:09.286 --> 08:10.806
We leave the Abbey alone.

08:10.846 --> 08:13.486
We need to find out...
Tuck, that's my final word!

09:17.406 --> 09:20.606
HE FARTS

09:23.326 --> 09:25.126
PLOP

09:39.206 --> 09:40.846
I'm busy.

09:43.646 --> 09:47.126
Laborare est orare, my son.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.366
Always remember.

09:49.406 --> 09:52.806
Work is prayer.

09:52.846 --> 09:55.526
Bene orasse est bene studuisse.

09:57.966 --> 10:00.446
I see. You are an assassin.

10:00.486 --> 10:02.206
No.

10:04.326 --> 10:06.326
Merely an inquisitor.

10:06.366 --> 10:08.646
You presume I fear your blade.

10:08.686 --> 10:10.246
I think you fear the Sheriff.

10:10.286 --> 10:13.926
What hold does he have over you that
you would damn a man like Robin Hood?

10:13.966 --> 10:16.526
A man of honour and justice.

10:16.566 --> 10:19.286
My son,

10:19.326 --> 10:27.086
there are things going on here of such magnitude, of
such complexity as to be beyond your understanding.

10:28.926 --> 10:30.566
Try me.

10:37.286 --> 10:43.366
Once you see what is hidden here, you
will understand why I had to do this.

10:43.406 --> 10:46.486
You know me, my son.

10:46.526 --> 10:48.126
Have faith in me again.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.126
Guards! Seize him!

11:41.526 --> 11:43.566
I came here to help you.

11:43.606 --> 11:46.006
No-one can help me.

11:46.046 --> 11:47.526
Take him.

12:01.646 --> 12:03.926
Shouldn't we be looking for Tuck?

12:03.966 --> 12:05.566
I don't trust that monk.

12:05.606 --> 12:07.406
He can look after himself.

12:07.446 --> 12:09.326
We've important work here.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.246
What are you doing here?

12:21.286 --> 12:24.086
We just wanted to make
sure you were provided for.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.566
I can't accept it.

12:29.606 --> 12:32.406
And nor will anyone else.

12:32.446 --> 12:34.246
After all we've
done for you people?

12:34.286 --> 12:37.326
All we've sacrificed? And this
is how you treat us, is it?

12:37.366 --> 12:39.966
And what about what
I've sacrificed?

12:40.006 --> 12:44.566
What we're all sacrificing every day while you
and the Sheriff play out your little war games.

12:44.606 --> 12:46.846
We can't take the risk, Robin.

12:46.886 --> 12:48.566
Not now the church has
branded you a heretic.

12:48.606 --> 12:50.166
Oh, come on!

12:50.206 --> 12:52.126
You don't buy all that mumbo jumbo.

12:52.166 --> 12:56.286
The Abbot of Kirklees is a
great man. He wouldn't lie.

12:56.326 --> 13:00.166
Rebecca, the Sheriff is using
the Abbot to frighten you.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.446
Well, it worked. Well,
let us protect you!

13:03.486 --> 13:04.926
Protect us?

13:04.966 --> 13:08.966
Where was your protection
when my boy needed it?

13:11.366 --> 13:15.006
Your boy died for
justice and truth.

13:16.806 --> 13:19.246
Don't let that all go for nothing.

13:19.286 --> 13:23.206
Robin, even you can't
take on the Church and win.

13:23.246 --> 13:25.206
Robin, the Sheriff's men!

13:25.246 --> 13:27.126
You can't be seen here.
Quick! Come on, get inside!

13:53.326 --> 13:55.006
Robin.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.086
This is one of
Hood's men! It's Tuck.

14:00.126 --> 14:03.606
Last night he broke into the Abbey.

14:03.646 --> 14:06.166
What are you thinking? We
can't just hand them over.

14:06.206 --> 14:09.166
They're heretics now.
You'll get us all killed.

14:09.206 --> 14:12.966
They've been good to us. I can't
just see them hanged. Or worse.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.726
Kate, don't be a fool.

14:14.766 --> 14:17.166
Don't be like your brother.

14:18.086 --> 14:19.446
Ten.

14:19.486 --> 14:21.766
We can take them. We
can't save Tuck now.

14:21.806 --> 14:24.766
If we go out there, the Sheriff will
know the people are sheltering us.

14:24.806 --> 14:28.366
He's still one of us. We
are not going out there.

14:28.406 --> 14:31.126
He's baiting us. We are not
playing the Sheriff's game.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.486
We stay put.Look at him! Hmmm?

14:36.646 --> 14:40.166
Trapped like a wild
animal caught in the snare.

14:43.446 --> 14:46.286
Is this how you want to end up?

14:49.526 --> 14:52.926
I'm your friend.

14:52.966 --> 14:56.966
Yes, I know we've
had our hard times

14:59.006 --> 15:01.526
but we will come through.

15:03.086 --> 15:04.886
Now, who

15:04.926 --> 15:08.086
will help me capture Robin Hood?

15:16.646 --> 15:19.086
Are you so blind
that you cannot see?

15:21.006 --> 15:23.366
I am not your enemy, Hood is.

15:23.406 --> 15:28.886
I have not forsaken you,
forsaken God, Hood has!

15:31.406 --> 15:35.646
If you do not assist me in the capture of
Robin Hood, then things will only get worse.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.686
Beginning with our friend here.

15:37.726 --> 15:41.526
Who will be torn apart
on the rack tomorrow.

15:41.566 --> 15:47.966
And unless you want the same for yourselves and
your loved ones, then you better come to your senses.

16:23.926 --> 16:30.566
You're no longer welcome here. And if any of you
come again, we'll have no choice but to turn you in.

16:30.606 --> 16:33.046
We have to protect ourselves now.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.206
Go and stay gone.

16:41.046 --> 16:42.526
Forever.

16:49.326 --> 16:50.806
Let's go.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.486
Leave us.

17:24.965 --> 17:28.846
He sent you, hasn't he?

17:28.886 --> 17:33.166
Why is a man of learning prepared to
sacrifice himself for a common thief?

17:33.206 --> 17:37.366
Robin Hood is the last hope for
this country.An outlaw? I doubt that.

17:37.406 --> 17:38.886
You've seen the people.

17:38.926 --> 17:41.126
They're crying out for
inspiration. For guidance.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.446
The Church can offer
the people guidance.

17:43.486 --> 17:48.686
The Church is lying to them. Unless you
give up Hood, Locksley is damned to death.

17:48.726 --> 17:52.046
Women, children, the
Sheriff will stop at nothing.

17:55.486 --> 17:59.566
There was a time when you would
never let yourself be so intimidated.

17:59.606 --> 18:02.206
When you would defend a
pauper against a Cardinal.

18:02.246 --> 18:05.446
You may have no care for your
own life my son, but surely...

18:05.486 --> 18:08.006
surely you don't
want innocents to die?

18:08.046 --> 18:10.166
Why have you lost your
stomach for the fight?!

18:10.206 --> 18:11.846
Not so, my son,

18:11.886 --> 18:13.446
not so.

18:13.486 --> 18:16.766
I have simply chosen a
different battleground.

18:16.806 --> 18:19.366
And what battleground is that?

18:19.406 --> 18:22.326
I know you, Abbot.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.486
I studied your writings
when I was a boy.

18:24.526 --> 18:27.006
Your translations of
Aristotle, of Plato.

18:27.046 --> 18:29.446
I followed your
teachings like an apostle.

18:29.486 --> 18:33.366
Unless you give up Hood, there's
nothing more I can do for you.

18:33.406 --> 18:37.006
Your battleground has always
been the words of great men.

18:37.046 --> 18:40.246
Your mission was always to bring
enlightenment to ordinary people.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.646
How has that changed?!Tuck...

18:44.846 --> 18:46.366
Tuck...

18:46.406 --> 18:49.886
some words are more
dangerous than others!

18:49.926 --> 18:54.446
Some words are deemed
too holy to be translated.

18:57.086 --> 18:59.286
Oh, sweet heavens, no.

19:01.806 --> 19:03.286
No, it can't be.

19:05.286 --> 19:06.846
The Holy Bible?

19:08.406 --> 19:10.046
In English?

19:10.086 --> 19:12.686
But the Pope has decreed
it remain in Latin.

19:12.726 --> 19:15.126
Now you see why I have
to tread carefully.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.046
Look.

19:21.086 --> 19:22.886
Look, my son.

19:26.166 --> 19:31.446
If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender
my body to the flames, but have not love,

19:31.486 --> 19:33.606
I gain nothing.

19:34.526 --> 19:36.566
"St Paul's letter
to the Corinthians."

19:36.606 --> 19:38.726
Ten years hard toil.

19:38.766 --> 19:41.646
This could change everything.

19:41.686 --> 19:45.646
Give the people the power
to interpret the will of God.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.526
It would be a revolution.

19:47.566 --> 19:51.926
I have to stop the
Sheriff burning my book.

19:51.966 --> 19:54.566
So this is why you are
the Sheriff's slave.

19:54.606 --> 19:59.686
He will destroy it unless
I make you betray Hood.

19:59.726 --> 20:02.526
Join with me.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.766
I will never betray him.

20:13.326 --> 20:15.926
Then I fear for your life, my son.

20:29.286 --> 20:31.286
How much for two barrels of tar?

20:31.326 --> 20:34.366
You got to have a signed warrant
from the Sheriff to purchase tar.

20:34.406 --> 20:37.286
How much to make sure you and
your family are provided for?

20:37.326 --> 20:39.526
How about that? Will
you cover for me?

20:39.566 --> 20:46.086
Where are you going? All right.

20:46.126 --> 20:50.166
Be careful though, yeah?Thanks.

20:50.206 --> 20:54.406
How much? Don't just stand
there gawping this time, eh?

20:54.446 --> 20:57.486
Say erm... Tell her she's perfect.

20:57.526 --> 21:00.046
Women love to hear
that sort of thing.

21:22.486 --> 21:25.966
Kate? I have to talk to you.

21:27.366 --> 21:31.526
The Sheriff's guards slaughtered all our
animals. Because we didn't give up Robin.

21:31.566 --> 21:33.046
I want to help you.

21:35.126 --> 21:37.886
I care about you, Kate.

21:38.966 --> 21:42.046
Why are you doing this?Because...

21:45.646 --> 21:48.286
I think you're perfect.

21:48.326 --> 21:50.406
Perfect?

21:51.486 --> 21:53.646
Is that a joke?

21:53.686 --> 21:55.846
I look at you

21:57.486 --> 21:59.686
and I want to...

22:02.606 --> 22:06.766
protect you.Can't you see
you're just making things worse?

22:06.806 --> 22:08.526
Maybe.

22:10.766 --> 22:15.726
Well, I'm sorry. I can't help it... I've never...Look,
nothing could ever happen between us. Ever.

22:15.766 --> 22:17.726
Do you understand?

22:17.766 --> 22:21.446
You're dirty, you smell
and you're trouble.

22:21.486 --> 22:23.766
The best thing you
could do is just vanish.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.486
Brother Tuck.

22:50.526 --> 22:55.806
For crimes against God, the Church
and the faithful of Nottingham,

22:55.846 --> 22:58.566
you are to be racked,
drawn and quartered.

23:05.566 --> 23:07.526
Beautiful day.

23:07.566 --> 23:10.046
Almost makes you want
to burst into song.

23:10.086 --> 23:11.886
You start off, I'll harmonize.

23:11.926 --> 23:13.406
Oh. Humour.

23:15.526 --> 23:23.046
Well, perhaps you need to know that my favourite
moment of this delightful little procedure

23:23.086 --> 23:27.526
is when you hear that
great big pop pop pop pop!

23:27.566 --> 23:30.086
This isn't over, Sheriff!

23:30.126 --> 23:33.406
Oh, really? What, you think
Hood's going to rescue you, do you?

23:33.446 --> 23:35.126
Well, I don't see him.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.806
Hood! Hood?

23:37.846 --> 23:39.406
Hoody Hoody...

23:39.446 --> 23:41.326
Come out wherever you are.

23:52.886 --> 23:55.366
Come back! Cowards! Back!

23:59.286 --> 24:01.686
You took your time! We were
a bit stretched.Watch out!

24:08.206 --> 24:09.966
Where is the second relief?!

24:32.806 --> 24:35.166
A cloth!

25:04.086 --> 25:08.006
I just thought I'd put the spark
back into our relationship, Sheriff!

25:18.166 --> 25:20.726
I thought I doubled the guard!

25:20.766 --> 25:23.926
Or did I just double
the incompetence?

25:23.966 --> 25:27.326
You've allowed Hood
to escape again!

25:27.366 --> 25:30.166
You're more useless than Gisborne!

25:37.766 --> 25:39.886
Tomorrow it's St Barnabus's day.

25:39.926 --> 25:41.686
All the people will
be in the Abbey.

25:41.726 --> 25:44.766
Yes. We must give them
something concrete.

25:44.806 --> 25:47.286
Something they can
touch, feel and smell.

25:47.326 --> 25:51.006
They don't need to touch
or feel God to believe.

25:51.046 --> 25:54.326
Idiot. These people need to be
frightened out of their wits.

25:54.366 --> 25:56.126
What on earth would
you have me tell them?

25:56.166 --> 26:00.366
That the hand of God will strike them
down if they don't help you capture Hood?

26:04.526 --> 26:07.086
What did you just say?

26:07.126 --> 26:09.886
The hand of... Oh.

26:09.926 --> 26:12.446
Oh, this is good.

26:12.486 --> 26:14.446
This is tremendous.

26:14.486 --> 26:18.406
Divine inspiration?I don't give
Him the credit, no, this was all me.

26:21.606 --> 26:25.526
I want every wretched villager
from Locksley in the Abbey tomorrow.

26:25.566 --> 26:29.486
I'll give them a St Barnabus's
day they'll never forget!

26:35.046 --> 26:37.126
You disobeyed me.

26:37.166 --> 26:41.966
I had no choice.Tuck, we never act alone!I had to
find out what hold the Sheriff had over the Abbot.

26:44.086 --> 26:46.726
And did you?Oh, yes.

26:46.766 --> 26:49.686
Yes, I did.Well?

26:49.726 --> 26:52.846
The Abbot has translated
the Bible into English.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.726
The Bible?

26:56.766 --> 26:59.246
In English?Yeah.

27:03.326 --> 27:06.246
Oh, hang on, hang
on. The Holy Bible

27:06.286 --> 27:10.406
in English?That's right, yes.

27:10.446 --> 27:11.966
Adam and Eve,

27:12.006 --> 27:14.566
the flood, Moses.

27:14.606 --> 27:17.486
In English? You catch
on fast, don't you?

27:20.246 --> 27:25.286
Loaves and fishes, crucifixion, resurrection,
the Final Judgement, all in English?Much!

27:25.326 --> 27:27.366
Is that even allowed?No!

27:27.406 --> 27:28.966
It's blasphemy!

27:29.006 --> 27:30.526
No, John, no!

27:30.566 --> 27:32.086
It's progress.

27:32.126 --> 27:35.446
It's taken ten years

27:35.486 --> 27:39.566
and it'll enlighten a nation.Tuck.

27:39.606 --> 27:42.526
Thank you, thank you.

27:44.286 --> 27:46.806
We have to get the Abbot to
reverse his edict against us.

27:46.846 --> 27:48.966
There's a special
service tomorrow morning.

27:49.006 --> 27:54.566
St Barnabus's day. Everyone will be
there. Including the Sheriff and his men.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.726
So we have to find
that Bible, right?

27:57.766 --> 27:59.526
Allan, you go with Tuck.

27:59.566 --> 28:05.166
All right.He's the only man who knows what to
look for. You know the castle better than anyone.

28:05.206 --> 28:07.446
When you find the Bible,
you bring it to us.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.686
Where?The Abbey, Allan.

28:09.726 --> 28:12.726
If the Sheriff is using the
Bible to make the Abbot lie,

28:12.766 --> 28:15.526
it's what we'll use to
make him tell the truth.

Dear Lord, no.

28:51.766 --> 28:54.126
Stop this horror at once!

28:56.566 --> 28:58.846
They're digging up graves now!

28:58.886 --> 29:01.166
Told you it was tremendous.

29:03.486 --> 29:04.966
Holy Relics.

29:05.006 --> 29:07.806
Something that they can
touch and feel and smell.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.406
Holy Relics?Ah.

29:09.446 --> 29:11.446
The bones of Saint Luke.

29:11.486 --> 29:15.046
Or more specifically the hand
of the great healer Saint Luke.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.966
Kept for safety at Kirklees Abbey.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.486
The precious treasure
Hood was after.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.446
The first body we
exhumed was no good.

29:25.486 --> 29:27.526
Funny, really
- you'll like this.

29:27.566 --> 29:32.326
In life he was a thief. Had both his hands
chopped off, at my orders. This is heinous.

29:32.366 --> 29:34.526
I know.

29:34.566 --> 29:37.046
But there is a kind of
poetic irony to it, I think?

29:37.086 --> 29:40.246
No more. I will no longer
be your whipping boy.

29:40.286 --> 29:41.646
Abbot!

29:51.006 --> 29:56.566
Please!Tomorrow morning,
you will preside...

No!..over the ceremony.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.606
agreeing with
everything that I say,

31:17.566 --> 31:18.686
This is it.

31:20.686 --> 31:22.646
It's the Bible.

31:24.646 --> 31:26.886
We need to get a move on, Tuck.

My children.

32:35.606 --> 32:38.686
I was once lost, like you.

32:40.246 --> 32:44.686
Wretched like you.
Wandering in the wilderness.

32:44.726 --> 32:50.486
But it was there, in the desert
crawling on my hands and knees

32:50.526 --> 32:52.646
like a dried crab...

32:54.206 --> 32:59.406
..that I was guided...to a cave.

32:59.446 --> 33:01.686
And it was in that cave...

33:03.446 --> 33:06.646
..that I found this -

33:06.686 --> 33:11.126
the hand of the divine
physician Saint Luke!

CONGREGATION GASPS

33:18.366 --> 33:21.846
It was this hand...that healed me.

33:23.006 --> 33:25.166
Healed me of my pain,

33:25.206 --> 33:31.766
guided me on the path to salvation
and cleansed me of all my sins!

33:34.446 --> 33:40.366
And it was this holy artefact
that Robin Hood and his gang of men

33:40.406 --> 33:47.206
tried so flagrantly to
steal, not once, but twice!

33:47.246 --> 33:50.326
That is why Robin Hood and his gang
attacked the brothers of Kirklees.

33:50.366 --> 33:54.166
That is why Hood sent in his
thug Tuck to break into the Abbey.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.406
And that is why Hood
must burn at the stake!

33:59.486 --> 34:01.326
Wrong way.

34:03.566 --> 34:04.846
Get the Bible to Robin!

34:33.525 --> 34:36.565
Lock down the Castle!
Search every room!

34:42.686 --> 34:44.166
No sign of them.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.326
There's no more time.
I have to go in now.

34:48.366 --> 34:50.606
This is suicide, Robin.
There's no other way.

34:51.806 --> 34:54.206
We have to go in there
and show we're not afraid.

34:54.246 --> 34:57.406
If we blink now, the people
will never believe in us again.

34:57.446 --> 35:00.886
I did give you an
ultimatum, remember?

35:04.526 --> 35:08.846
So...where is he, eh?

35:10.646 --> 35:12.046
Hmm?

35:13.366 --> 35:15.766
Where's Robin Hood?

35:15.806 --> 35:17.366
I don't see him.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.006
Then open your eyes!

35:29.166 --> 35:31.726
How noble.

35:31.766 --> 35:34.766
What are you going
to do, Hood? Hmm?

35:34.806 --> 35:37.966
Are you going to kill
me? Going to shoot me?

35:38.006 --> 35:42.686
And risk bringing down the wrath of Prince John on
Nottingham? Well, I don't think you want that, do you?

35:42.726 --> 35:44.206
No.

35:45.886 --> 35:48.246
No, I wouldn't.

35:50.246 --> 35:52.326
Because I love Nottingham.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.726
I love its people.

35:56.766 --> 36:00.206
And I want to see them freed from
your greed and your corruption.

36:03.686 --> 36:06.966
What about your greed?
And your corruption?

36:07.006 --> 36:10.086
You attacked the Abbey to try
and steal the holy artefacts.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.326
I didn't.

36:12.366 --> 36:16.926
Nor did I tax these people till they bled and
brutalised them when they had nothing more to give.

36:16.966 --> 36:22.406
Yes, but you did break into the Abbey with the
intention of stealing the Hand of Saint Luke.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.566
That is not the Hand of Saint Luke!

36:25.566 --> 36:27.686
Really?

36:29.126 --> 36:32.366
What? Pray tell. Whose hand is it?

36:32.406 --> 36:34.886
Ask the Abbot.

36:37.766 --> 36:40.446
Well, come on, Abbot.

36:40.486 --> 36:42.446
Tell them.

36:42.486 --> 36:45.006
Yes, come on, Abbot.

36:45.046 --> 36:46.886
Tell them.

36:46.926 --> 36:49.366
The truth is always the truth.

36:49.406 --> 36:51.726
You can't change
that with an edict.

36:51.766 --> 36:55.166
Yes, and they deserve
to be told the truth.

36:55.206 --> 36:59.406
You tell them now
and this is all over.

36:59.446 --> 37:01.406
It certainly will be.

37:01.446 --> 37:04.246
If you say that relic is real

37:04.286 --> 37:06.526
then three innocent men will die.

37:08.086 --> 37:10.526
But if you deny it,

37:10.566 --> 37:13.446
those people must be
released from your edict.

37:18.246 --> 37:21.806
And your reputation will
be ground into the dust.

37:21.846 --> 37:29.526
And nothing you ever say or do will
ever have any authority ever again.

37:29.566 --> 37:31.766
You will be finished.

37:37.686 --> 37:38.726
Your choice.

37:38.766 --> 37:43.246
And the choices we make at these
moments define us for eternity.

37:51.046 --> 37:56.246
I decree, by the holy
power of the Church,

37:56.286 --> 37:58.686
that this is the hand of the
Holy Evangelist Saint Luke.

It's over.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.446
I just wonder if the world
is quite ready for it.

38:35.486 --> 38:39.326
Tuck, this is no place for decent,
educated men. Give me my book.

38:41.446 --> 38:45.486
"If I give all I possess to the poor
and surrender my body to the flames,

38:45.526 --> 38:47.526
but have not love, I gain nothing".

I'm going to burn this book.No!

Hood! Tuck, don't be a fool!

38:54.326 --> 38:55.886
Yes, Tuck.

38:55.926 --> 38:57.646
Book burning is my job.

39:02.326 --> 39:04.206
Book, please.

39:08.206 --> 39:12.526
I shall be holding onto that until Robin Hood
and his gang of maggots are reduced to ashes.

39:55.486 --> 39:57.006
Kate, please!

39:57.046 --> 39:58.806
It isn't true!

40:03.486 --> 40:06.406
Heretics! Devils! I trusted you!

40:09.526 --> 40:11.206
For crimes against the Church,

40:11.246 --> 40:13.566
heretical and
blasphemous obscenity...

40:13.606 --> 40:14.926
Come on, Robin.

40:16.006 --> 40:17.806
..Robin Hood... The
rope's too thick.

40:21.686 --> 40:24.086
I can't get through it.
We're toast. I knew it.

40:24.126 --> 40:25.926
Light the fire!

40:30.286 --> 40:32.846
Argh!

40:34.246 --> 40:37.286
Wait! One moment.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.206
Yes.

40:43.886 --> 40:46.726
He has offended the
faithful therefore

40:46.766 --> 40:49.966
the faithful must condemn him.

40:50.006 --> 40:51.726
The Abbot's right.

40:51.766 --> 40:57.046
It's the duty of every
man, woman and child

40:57.086 --> 40:59.446
to destroy the heretic Robin Hood.

41:07.206 --> 41:12.606
Now, are you ready
to condemn the heretic

41:12.646 --> 41:16.526
or be damned yourself? Eh?

41:23.086 --> 41:24.086
Burn them!

41:32.726 --> 41:34.926
Maggie, Maggie, it's all right.

41:34.966 --> 41:36.646
Just do it.

41:43.886 --> 41:46.886
Very touching. Very sweet.

41:46.926 --> 41:49.966
HE LAUGHS

41:54.286 --> 41:57.646
Look, I'm burning them.

41:59.006 --> 42:02.406
Burn them! Burn them!
CROWD:Burn them! Burn them!

42:15.206 --> 42:18.446
Enough! People of Nottingham!

42:18.486 --> 42:20.486
You have been betrayed!

42:20.526 --> 42:24.406
Stop him!Stay where you are or
your souls will be damned forever!

42:26.566 --> 42:28.606
You have been deceived!

42:28.646 --> 42:32.126
That was not the
hand of Saint Luke.

42:32.166 --> 42:36.526
It was a bone, sacrilegiously
disinterred from a peasant's grave.

42:36.566 --> 42:38.846
It was meant to deceive you.

42:38.886 --> 42:42.046
It was meant to control you,

42:42.086 --> 42:44.646
but I stand before
you full of shame!

42:46.446 --> 42:50.686
Hurry up, Much. This
man is the true devil!

42:50.726 --> 42:54.526
He steals your hopes,
he steals your souls.

42:57.326 --> 42:59.566
He is the spawn of Satan!

43:02.326 --> 43:04.046
I warned you!

43:04.086 --> 43:05.766
I warned you!

43:06.726 --> 43:07.966
Is everyone ready?

43:09.726 --> 43:11.286
I warned you!

43:13.726 --> 43:15.006
Now! Now!

43:25.046 --> 43:26.766
No!

43:42.646 --> 43:46.646
I will never look at a pig on a
spit in the same way ever again.

43:52.606 --> 43:53.886
To the Abbot.

43:55.806 --> 43:57.046
ALL: To the Abbot.

44:15.766 --> 44:21.806
"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth..."

44:27.846 --> 44:30.846
The new tax collector comes
today. they say he is very good.

44:30.886 --> 44:32.806
I've come to make Nottingham pay.

44:35.726 --> 44:37.526
Thank you, Katie.

44:37.566 --> 44:40.126
You've just made it onto
Nottingham's Most Wanted list.

44:42.286 --> 44:45.246
Some knights in shining armour you lot are
- now I have to leave home.

44:45.286 --> 44:49.166
Do you ever get used to being
apart from your family?No.

44:49.206 --> 44:52.606
You don't get used to that.
Robin is not here to save you now.
