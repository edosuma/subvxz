Hey, Sanka.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.909
This steering wheel
is finished.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.793
All right, team, let's get ready
for the pre-race cheer. Ready?

03:32.920 --> 03:35.195
- Yes, sir!
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

03:35.320 --> 03:38.710
All right,
one, two, three, toot!

03:38.840 --> 03:40.796
Who's the captain
of our crew?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.036
Who's a friend to me and you?

03:43.160 --> 03:47.358
Kind of nice, good-looking too.
Sanka! Sanka! Yea, Sanka!

03:48.440 --> 03:50.351
Get back to work!

03:50.480 --> 03:53.552
Who's the big hot bag of air who
doesn't have to comb his hair...

03:53.680 --> 03:55.875
who doesn't bathe
and doesn't care?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.549
- Sanka! Sanka! Sanka!
- Yea, Sanka! Hey!

03:59.680 --> 04:01.477
What's happenin', star?
Where you been, man?

04:01.600 --> 04:05.275
You almost missed my all-time world
record: seventh derby in a row.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.392
Easy, Rasta. l'm not going to forget
my best friend on this day of days.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.559
Derice, my grandfather says
you're definitely going to
make it to the Olympics.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.399
He says you're even faster
than your father.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.716
-Yeah, man, do it for Jamaica!
-Hey, you know what my grandfather says?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.910
- What?
- Get back to work!

04:21.040 --> 04:23.349
- Booie, booie!
- What are you talkin' about?

04:23.480 --> 04:26.233
Good luck, man. l'll see you
at the finish line, all right?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.436
- Hi, Momma Coffie.
- Hi, Derice.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.357
- Derice, is Sanka ready?
- Who knows?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.755
Ready. That boy's never ready.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.589
He's a lazy, crazy, sorry,
no-good bag of bones.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.836
So what you laughing at?

04:45.880 --> 04:47.996
All pushcarts
to the start position!

04:48.080 --> 04:50.594
- Ready, little man?
- Ready, big man.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.517
Kiss the lucky egg.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.638
Let's go!

04:57.080 --> 05:00.436
- On your marks...
- Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.915
Get on up!
lt's pushcart time!

05:03.040 --> 05:05.110
and go !

05:09.720 --> 05:12.917
Here we go, Winston!
The Rockett has been launched!

05:13.040 --> 05:15.315
Hey, fruitcake!
Where'd you get that cart?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.193
Clear out!
Come on, move out! Look out!

05:20.080 --> 05:22.355
Sanka Coffie,
pushcart champion!

05:22.480 --> 05:25.313
- Pushcart champion!
- Get away! Get away!

05:25.440 --> 05:27.556
Hey, grandma, out of my way!

05:27.680 --> 05:32.800
Hey, Sunday driver, make room
for the Rasta Rockett! Make room!

05:32.920 --> 05:35.912
- Sanka, four more carts left!
- Pee Wee, move! Move out!

05:36.040 --> 05:39.999

and Jamaica loves me!

05:40.120 --> 05:42.839
Champion! Champion!
You can't mess with the best!

05:42.960 --> 05:47.238
- Move over! Move over!
- Get away! Get off me!

05:47.360 --> 05:48.839
- Go, Sanka!
- Get him! Get him!

05:48.960 --> 05:52.191
One more cart left!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:52.320 --> 05:54.356
Yes! We win!

05:58.520 --> 06:00.317
Jump, Winston, jump!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.917
Sanka!

06:16.440 --> 06:18.670
Move it, man!
Move, move, move!

06:18.800 --> 06:21.314
Sanka, you dead?

06:21.440 --> 06:23.237
Yeah, man.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.555
And where do you think
you're going?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.716
You caught me.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.150
- You have papers to grade.
- l'm just getting in one last run.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.593
l can't believe the tryouts
are finally here.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.798
- You nervous?
- l'm not nervous.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.959
l'm ready. l've been ready
for this day my whole life.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.993
l don't care how fast they run,
l'm going to run faster.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.318
l don't care how much
they want it, l want it more.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.277
l'm going to the Olympics, baby.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.831
l feel it.
l'm going to win the gold.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.669
Derice, are you nervous?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.597
l'm terrified.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.351
lt's my turn, Joy!
lt's my turn!

07:21.960 --> 07:25.157
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the final event...

07:25.280 --> 07:26.998
of today's Olympic tryouts.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.677
We have now come to the
main event of our games...

07:32.800 --> 07:36.395
the running
of the 100-metre finals.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.795
We've had a most
successful afternoon...

07:38.920 --> 07:41.593
and l'd like to congratulate
all the athletes...

07:41.720 --> 07:44.598
who have participated
in today's events.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.156
- You sure no one can beat him?
- Oh, sure, l'm sure.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.396
l'm just a little concerned
about that big baldy.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.192
Let me first congratulate our athletes
on a splendid performance...

07:59.320 --> 08:02.676
and let me remind them that
only the top four finishers...

08:02.800 --> 08:08.272
will earn the right to represent
Jamaica in the forthcoming
summer games in Seoul, Korea.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.358
Wait. Y-You're Derice Bannock,
right?

08:11.480 --> 08:14.552
- That's me.
- Oh. l hope l make the team.

08:14.680 --> 08:19.913
-lt would be a real honour to
run with you. Good luck to you.
-Good luck to you.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.237
Derice Bannock.
Hey, good luck to you too.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.954
Runners, take your marks.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.431
Get set!

09:24.640 --> 09:27.552
Mr Coolidge, please,
you have to run the race over!

09:27.680 --> 09:30.069
l'm sorry, Derice.
Nothing can be done.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.077
But l was born to compete
in the Olympics!

09:32.200 --> 09:34.714
Then you're going to have to work
on your boxing or your cycling.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.434
Those are the only other two sports
in which Jamaica competes.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.358
l am not a boxer,
l am a runner.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.755
And it wasn't fair.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.077
lt rarely is, my boy.
lt rarely is.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.718
Well, Papa, what do l do now?

09:53.840 --> 09:57.992
Look, Derice, let it go, eh?
Let it go.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.680
You'll have another chance
in four years.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.677
Yeah.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.477
Mr Coolidge...

10:07.600 --> 10:10.068
who is the other man in
the picture with my father?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.589
lrving Blitzer. He's an
American who lives here.

10:12.720 --> 10:16.156
- Unless, of course, he's
been arrested or shot.
- Excuse me?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.157
Well, he's a bookie now.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.590
Takes his bets in a small
pool hall just past Sandy Bay.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.678
- lsn't that a gold medal
around his neck?
- Oh, yeah.

10:24.800 --> 10:30.079
That lunatic was an Olympic
bobsledder who tried to get
your father to switch sports.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.557
He had some theory about using
track sprinters to push the bobsleds.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.069
Some ridiculous
thing like that.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.668
Can you imagine
a Jamaican bobsledder?

10:42.200 --> 10:44.953
And you're sure this man,
he lives on the island?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.036
- Oh, yes.
- Mr Coolidge, thanks a lot.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.277
- Good, Derice.
- Oh, could l borrow this picture?

10:50.400 --> 10:54.393
- Bring it back!
- Yes, sir. Thanks a lot, Mr Coolidge.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.796
- Oh, just one more thing.
- Mmm?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.150
What's a bobsled?

11:01.680 --> 11:03.750
That's a bobsled.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.509
Oh. So a bobsled is
a pushcart with no wheels.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.552
-That's what it looks like here.
-Let me see that.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.951
All right. ''The key elements
for a successful sled team...

11:18.080 --> 11:22.358
are a steady driver
and three strong runners
to push off down the ice.""

11:22.480 --> 11:25.552
lce? lce?

11:25.680 --> 11:27.477
Well...

11:29.040 --> 11:30.871
it's kind of a
winter sport, you know.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.879
- You mean winter, as in ice?
- Maybe.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.437
You mean winter, as in igloos
and Eskimos and penguins and ice?

11:39.560 --> 11:42.028
- Possibly.
- See you.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.957
Where you going?

11:44.080 --> 11:46.913
l'm going to take a hot bath.
l'm getting cold just thinking
about all this ice.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.477
- No, man! You're going to be
part of my bobsled team!
- What do you need me for?

11:51.600 --> 11:55.832
Who is the best pushcart driver
in all o' Jamaica?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.757
- You're looking at him?
- Then you're going to do it?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.836
No!

11:59.960 --> 12:01.951
Hey, man, you could be famous.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.436
You could have your picture
on a Wheaties box.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.394
But you said ''no,'' and that's
all right, because l don't need you.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.796
Everybody is going to want
to be on my bobsled team!

12:12.920 --> 12:15.957
Look, star, let me tell you
a little something, all right?

12:16.080 --> 12:19.356
When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.711
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,
''Sanka, you are my best friend.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.912
We been through a whole heap together
and l really, really need you.""

12:29.320 --> 12:32.551
Sanka, you're right.
And you are my best friend.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.274
- And we've been through
a whole lot together.
- Heap. Heap.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.119
Sorry, man.
Whole heap together.

12:38.240 --> 12:42.597
- ''And l really, really need you.''
- And l really, really need you.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.551
- Forget it.
- But you just said if l said that--

12:44.680 --> 12:48.389
All right.
All right, all right. All right, man.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.636
So, let's talk about
this bill-sled team.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.354
- No, bobsled team.
- Whoever.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.075
Now, about the Wheaties box--
l'm going to be on it by myself, right?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.395
No, man, you're going to
be on it with me.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.795
And down the stretch they come!
Tumbleweed is holding on...

13:02.920 --> 13:05.070
- as Captain Video makes it
all the way on the outside.
- Yes, Tumbleweed, yes!

13:05.200 --> 13:07.475
- Come on! That's it!
- Brewster is dropping back
as Tumbleweed holds the rail.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.670
- Good Tumbleweed! Good Tumbleweed!
- And here comes Captain Video
on the outside!

13:09.800 --> 13:14.078
- Tumbleweed is slowing!
- No, Tumbleweed! No! Bad
Tumbleweed! What are you doing?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.509
- Tumbleweed can't hold it and he
gets pinned against the rail.
- What? Don't do--

13:16.640 --> 13:18.596
- lt's anyone's race
as they approach the rail!
- Don't do that! Let him out!

13:18.720 --> 13:20.836
- Captain Video makes his move!
Tumbleweed is running gamely...
- No! l need this one!

13:20.960 --> 13:23.349
- but Captain Video seems
just a little bit too strong!
- Please! Come on!

13:23.480 --> 13:25.277
- Here they come!
- No!

13:25.400 --> 13:28.312
Yes! Tumbleweed can't hold it,
as Captain Video takes charge.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.557
And it's Brewster finishing in second,
Susan's Pride finishes third...

13:31.680 --> 13:33.716
and Tumbleweed
is nowhere in sight!

13:33.840 --> 13:35.990
But, my, oh, my,
the odds-on favourite...

13:36.120 --> 13:38.554
- showed his true colours
with that late-stretch run.
- That's all right. Uh-huh.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.796
Tumbleweed held on momentarily,
but realistically...

13:40.920 --> 13:42.911
only a fool would put
their money on Tumbleweed.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.837
That horse had no chance of--

13:49.800 --> 13:52.075
That guy won two gold medals?

13:54.840 --> 13:56.353
l think so.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.155
That's Tumbleweed gone.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.952
Okay, next race.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.476
Excuse me. Are you
Mr lrving Blitzer?

14:12.600 --> 14:14.716
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.230
My name is Derice Bannock.
This is my teammate Sanka Coffie.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.510
Greetings, sled god.

14:20.640 --> 14:26.033
We were just wondering if you'd
be interested in coaching the
first Jamaican bobsled team.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.914
Derice, remember the radio?
Radio?

14:30.040 --> 14:32.838
Stick. Shooting with the stick.
Let's go!

14:32.960 --> 14:34.757
Let's go, Derice!

14:47.400 --> 14:49.630
Come on, Coach.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.557
Just help me get started!

15:04.120 --> 15:05.917
- Greetings, sled god.
- Sorry to bother you...

15:06.040 --> 15:08.270
- Get out! Get out!
- but you're the only one
that can help us!

15:17.000 --> 15:19.070
- Go away.
- Okay.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.390
Nice to meet you!

15:22.520 --> 15:25.512
- Maybe today is a bad day.
- Yeah.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.428
l'll come back tomorrow, and
the next day, and the next day,

15:29.560 --> 15:31.357
- No. No!
- and the next day.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.789
- Look, whatever you're name is--
- Derice.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.196
All right, Derice, let me lay
out some difficulties for you.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.436
Snow-- you don't have any.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.710
lt's 900 degrees out there.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.637
Time-- you don't have any.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.751
The Olympics
are in three months.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.917
And me-- you don't have me.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.271
As far as l'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.755
l don't want to do it,
l don't want to coach it...

15:54.880 --> 15:57.872
and most of all--
and l mean most of all--

15:58.000 --> 16:02.073
l don't want to be within
2,000 miles of anyone who does.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.557
- Now, did you follow all that?
- Then how come you still have
that poster on the wall?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.877
ls that what's bothering you?

16:14.720 --> 16:17.439
There. ls that better?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.357
Are you happy?

16:26.040 --> 16:29.919
Like l said,
my name is Derice Bannock.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.951
l'm Ben Bannock's son.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.676
l haven't seen this picture
in twenty years.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.756
Huh! Would you look at me then.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.914
- Ooh. Would you look at me now?
- Please, Mr Blitzer.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.598
Just give me a chance.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.597
lf l don't have what it takes,
we forget the whole thing.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.555
- Believe me, kid, you do not
have what it takes.
- But you thought my father did.

16:57.680 --> 17:02.071
Your father was one of
the toughest competitors l ever saw.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.919
He ran the 100 metres
in ten-flat.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.871
Well, l run it in 9.9.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.157
Come on. Coach me.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.118
Sorry. You're a couple
decades late.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.435
Oh, l see. Well, it might be
easy for you...

17:21.560 --> 17:23.357
to walk away from me,
Mr Blitzer...

17:23.480 --> 17:25.277
but you can't walk away
from this:

17:25.400 --> 17:28.073
20 years ago you came down here
to see if you could make...

17:28.200 --> 17:30.270
a Jamaican sprinter
into a bobsledder...

17:30.400 --> 17:32.630
and you never got that chance.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.751
Look at me, Mr Blitzer.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.677
l'm your chance.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.756
Take it.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.715
All right, everyone quiet down.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.717
Nice group here.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.276
Now, for two of you lucky people,
our trip to the Olympics...

17:57.400 --> 17:59.197
starts right now.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.397
And l want to introduce you...

18:02.520 --> 18:04.590
to Mr lrving Blitzer...

18:04.720 --> 18:07.996
who's going to be
our expert bobsled coach.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.869
Sanka, hit it, man.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.275
You're on the air, sled god!

18:17.280 --> 18:21.432
- Gentlemen, a bobsled
is a simple thing.
- Yeah! So's a toilet!

18:23.800 --> 18:26.598
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.439
Basically, what you're looking to do
is get your sorry rear ends...

18:29.560 --> 18:33.075
from the top of an icy chute
to the bottom.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.317
You're ziggin',
you're zaggin'.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.433
lt's the biggest, coldest roller
coaster you've ever been on.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.991
l-lce.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.072
Oh, yeah.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.395
Oh, yeah.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.397
l almost forgot, uh--

18:55.520 --> 18:58.273
One minor drawback to this
delightful winter sport...

18:58.400 --> 19:01.073
is the high-speed crash.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.236
That hurt. Aah.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.592
Always remember, your bones
will not break in a bobsled.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.631
No, no. They shatter.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.277
So...

19:18.400 --> 19:20.197
who wants in?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.397
Look, Baldy's here.

19:37.720 --> 19:41.952
- Glad you could make it, man!
- Don't touch me!

19:42.080 --> 19:45.117
No problem. So what's your name?

19:45.240 --> 19:47.037
Yul Brenner.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.436
Well, it's good to have you
as a teammate, Brenner.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.154
Let's get one thing straight,
Bannock.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.430
We may be on the same team...

19:58.560 --> 20:00.755
but l am no one's teammate.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.269
- Long as you come here to bobsled.
- Hey, listen, man...

20:03.400 --> 20:05.470
the only reason why
l come here...

20:05.600 --> 20:08.956
is to get off of this
stinkin' island.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.833
lf l have to take one
of those bobsleds to do it...

20:11.960 --> 20:13.916
then all right.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.793
- No problem.
- Uh, yes.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.959
Yes, l have a problem. There's
no such thing as a three-man sled.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.072
- You're one Jamaican short.
- Hey.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.988
The meeting start yet?

20:29.120 --> 20:30.917
- Uh-oh.
- You!

20:31.040 --> 20:34.589
- l'll kill you.
College boy, l'll kill you!
- Wait! Hold on !

20:34.720 --> 20:37.598
- Hey, hey! Lighten up!
Whoa! Whoa! Down, boy!
- Wait a second!

20:37.720 --> 20:40.951
- He didn't mean anything!
He didn't mean it!
- You're dead! You're dead!

20:41.080 --> 20:43.833
Kill him,
and we don't have a team.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.635
- l'm not riding
in the same sled as that.
- He tripped me too, you know.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.355
But in case you haven't noticed,
there's no one else here.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.119
You're crowding me, slinky head.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.151
Slinky head.
That's a good one.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.555
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.832
lf it wasn't for you, rich boy,
l'd be in the Olympics right now.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.757
l don't know what
you all are arguing about...

21:04.880 --> 21:08.873
- 'cause Derice was going to
beat both your butts anyway.
- What are you talking about?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.831
How 'bout l beat your butt
right now?

21:10.960 --> 21:14.077
How 'bout l draw a line down the middle
of your head so it looks like a butt?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.475
Forget it, man. l'm gone.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.718
Fine. Stay here on the island.
We're going to Canada.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.517
All right.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.631
l'll do it.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.355
But you'd better tell
this mama's boy...

21:39.480 --> 21:41.675
to stay the hell
away from me.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.109
You understand?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.037
No problem.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.117
Hey, lrv...

21:49.240 --> 21:53.677
say hello to the first
Jamaican bobsled team.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.317
Oh, goody.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.954
Gentlemen, this is a bobsled.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.036
Sort of.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.357
- All right, here's what
we're going to do. Yul--
- Don't touch me.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.268
Of course. Sorry. You're going
to be the second middle man.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.710
You're strong, you're fast, and
you're going to love that seat.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.229
Junior, you're the first
middle man.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.272
You're quick, you're sharp.
Hop in.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.356
-Sanka--
-l know-- l'm the driver, right?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.358
- No, you're the brake man.
- No-- No, l'm the driver.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.074
No, you're not.
You're the brake man.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.317
- l'm the driver.
- You're not! You're the brake man.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.317
See, you don't understand!
l am Sanka Coffie!

22:39.440 --> 22:41.874
l'm the best pushcart driver
in all of Jamaica!

22:42.000 --> 22:45.310
l must drive! Do you dig
where l'm coming from?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.237
- Yeah, l dig where you're coming from.
- Good.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.397
Now dig where l'm coming from.
l'm coming from two gold medals.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.830
l'm coming from nine world records
in both the two and four-man events.

22:53.960 --> 22:58.590
l'm coming from ten years of
intense competition with the
best athletes in the world.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.870
That's a hell of a place
to be coming from.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.436
You see, Sanka, the driver
has to work harder than anyone.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.358
He's the first to show up
and the last to leave.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.951
When his teammates are all out
drinking beer, he's up in his
room studying pictures of turns.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.517
You see, a driver must remain focused
one hundred percent at all times.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.349
Not only is he responsible for knowing
every inch of every course he races...

23:20.480 --> 23:23.836
he's also responsible for the lives
of the other three people in his sled.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.837
Now, do you want
that responsibility?

23:27.960 --> 23:30.315
l say we make Derice
the driver.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.273
So do l, Sanka, so do l.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.194
Oh, the back is nice.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.709
All right, Father, listen here.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.310
You see, l've made up my mind.
l'm going to be a bobsledder.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.558
That's right. A bobsledder.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.717
Oh, really?

23:54.840 --> 23:57.832
Well, l'm sorry
you feel that way.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.838
Fine. Cut off my allowance.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.190
Because you see, Father...

24:03.320 --> 24:07.393
a man has got to do
what a man has got to do.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.516
Just who l wanted to see.

24:19.640 --> 24:23.838
- M-M-Me?
- You know where l just came from?

24:23.960 --> 24:27.350
- W-Where?
- l got you a job...

24:27.480 --> 24:32.429
with Webster, Webster and Cohen,
the biggest brokerage house in Miami!

24:32.560 --> 24:36.109
- Oh, right. Webster, Webster and Cohen.
- Yes! That's right.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.879
And you start end of the month.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.153
- Yes, but l thought that l would--
- Look...

24:44.280 --> 24:47.955
we went along with this
track nonsense long enough.

24:48.080 --> 24:52.915
And we agreed that it's time to
get on with your real future. Right?

24:54.360 --> 24:57.079
- l know--
- Right?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.555
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.156
l'm going to tell your mother.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.030
l guess we sure told him.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.431
Winning a bobsled race
is about one thing: the push start.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.751
Now, l know you dainty little
track stars think you're fast.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.314
Well, heh, let's see
how fast you are...

25:31.440 --> 25:34.591
when you push
a 600-pound sled.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.269
Now, a respectable start time
is 5.7 seconds.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.278
lf you speed demons can't
whip off an even six-flat...

25:41.400 --> 25:44.312
you have a better chance of
becoming a barbershop quartet.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.110
Derice, come on! Hey!

25:48.240 --> 25:50.515
Junior, get in! Never mind!

25:52.640 --> 25:55.200
We'll have to move it back.
Let's go!

25:55.320 --> 25:59.836
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Slow down! What are you
doing to me? Slow down!

25:59.960 --> 26:02.394
- l got some wild, wild life
- 14.3. No good.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.432
- l've got some bills
to pay, whoa-oh
- 13.5. 11.7.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.199
This is what it's all about!
This is where you win or lose the race!

26:08.320 --> 26:10.754
Right here in the pushcart! This
is where you're gonna practise!

26:10.880 --> 26:13.155
Right here! Right here in the
Volkswagen, you're gonna practise!

26:13.280 --> 26:16.670
No, Junior, quit falling down!
Come on, hustle!

26:16.800 --> 26:18.916
Catch up to them!
There you go!

26:19.040 --> 26:22.032
Junior! No! Do it again!

26:22.160 --> 26:25.470
Whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop, Derice!
Stop! Wait! Wait for me!

26:25.600 --> 26:28.353
Wait! l'm in! Stop!
Slow down!

26:31.320 --> 26:35.677
- Great. Very good. Try it again.
- Wild, wild life

26:35.800 --> 26:39.236
lf l've said it once,
l've said it 46 times.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.750
Cold weather endurance is vital
to building a successful sled team.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.112
- Cold enough?
- Wild, wild life

26:49.240 --> 26:53.677
- You got to live your life
You got to live your life
- One, two, three!

26:53.800 --> 26:56.155
Wild, wild life

27:00.440 --> 27:02.556
- Wild, wild life
- Go! Go! Go!

27:08.920 --> 27:11.912
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Whoa! Slow down!

27:12.040 --> 27:15.350
- Sanka, hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes, man!
- l can't! lt's stuck!

27:15.480 --> 27:16.629
Hold on!

27:19.960 --> 27:22.758
About some wild, wild life

27:34.400 --> 27:37.153
Sanka, you dead?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.838
Yeah, man.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.759
What have you done to the
police unit? l shall arrest you!

27:44.880 --> 27:48.156
- Who owns this thing?
- We do, sir.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.989
- And who are you?
- The Jamaican bobsled team, sir.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.000
Don't give me that business.
l wasn't born yesterday.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.918
5.9! 5.9!
You did it! You did it!

28:02.040 --> 28:05.237
5.9! We did it!
We did it! 5.9!

28:05.360 --> 28:08.796
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way. 5.9, guys. What?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.673
- Who are you?
- l'm their coach! You guys okay?

28:11.800 --> 28:13.233
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- How's the sled?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.476
- Yeah, man, we're fine.
- Sled's okay?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.397
Well, it's in the wrong place!
Get it back to the top of the hill!

28:17.520 --> 28:20.318
Let's move it right now, you slackers!
Move it! Let's hustle! Come on!

28:20.440 --> 28:23.034
Let's move it!
Come on, you guys! Move it!

28:24.760 --> 28:27.672
l'm not asking for
a winter sports programme.

28:27.800 --> 28:32.191
All l need is a lousy 20 grand so l can
get us to the Olympics. That's all.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.993
How in God's name are you
going to get to the Olympics?

28:35.120 --> 28:37.429
These boys have never even
seen a sled race before!

28:37.560 --> 28:41.314
Mr Coolidge, l have been looking at
sledders since l was twelve years old.

28:41.440 --> 28:45.115
lf l say these kids can make it
to the Olympics, they can make
it to the Olympics.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.516
Okay. Well, l'll tell you
what we'll do.

28:48.640 --> 28:52.349
Practise down here with
the boys a bit more, and when
you're a little further along...

28:52.480 --> 28:55.040
- l'll come along and see you--
- No! No! No!

28:55.160 --> 28:57.879
Now, just a minute,
Mr Blitzer.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.309
This country enjoys
a fine athletic tradition...

29:00.440 --> 29:02.670
and if you think l'm going to give you
the little money we have...

29:02.800 --> 29:06.110
so that you can parade us around in
front of the world like a freak show...

29:06.240 --> 29:08.037
you've got another thing coming.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.072
lt's bad enough how you
embarrassed your own country.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.475
l'm certainly not going to
allow you to embarrass ours.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.757
No go, kid.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.436
That's okay, Coach.
We'll get the money.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.916
- Do the words ''give up''
mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.153
Some people say you know
they can't believe

29:29.280 --> 29:31.510
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

29:31.640 --> 29:34.677
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

29:34.800 --> 29:36.916
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

29:37.040 --> 29:41.272
Hi. l'm here to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.472
We're looking for a sponsor
for the first Jamaican bobsled team.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.877
Oh!

31:08.560 --> 31:11.836
We have the one Derice
and the one Junior

31:11.960 --> 31:14.872
l'll pay you a dollar
to shut up!

31:18.520 --> 31:23.116
We got nine dollars and fifty-two cents
from Yul Brenner, thank you.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.629
We got a hundred and eighty-four
dollars from Derice and me.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.513
Sanka, how did your singing
on the street go?

31:30.520 --> 31:32.590
How did it go?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.517
lt went like this:

31:34.640 --> 31:36.676
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

31:36.800 --> 31:38.870
- Sanka, we know.
- Jamaica, we have a bobsled team

31:39.000 --> 31:40.319
- Sanka.
- We have the one Derice--

31:40.440 --> 31:43.193
How much?

31:43.320 --> 31:46.517
- l made a dollar and sixteen cents.
- Oh, that's great.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.074
We're only short about
nineteen thousand bucks.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.509
- Sorry l'm late, everybody.
- No, really, that is terrific.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.677
Don't pack a suitcase, Junior.
We're not going.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.557
Mmm, that's too bad.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.358
- Whoa!
- Oh! Where'd you get it, man?

32:04.480 --> 32:08.268
- l sold my car.
- Yes, man.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.153
- l am going.
- No, we're not.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.113
Look here, Junior, l appreciate
what you're trying to do here...

32:14.240 --> 32:16.959
but we can't accept this money;
it just wouldn't be proper.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.958
Uh, Derice, if l hadn't
tripped you fellas...

32:20.080 --> 32:24.153
we'd already have been going
to the Olympics; l want you to have it.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.155
You mean you want us
to have it, right?

32:32.280 --> 32:34.271
Right. Us.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.914
Thanks a lot, Junior.
Thanks a whole heap, man.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.875
Remember, this doesn't mean
that l like you, you understand?

32:44.000 --> 32:47.993
Be sure to thank your father for
us, 'cause Lord knows, he didn't
have to let you sell that car.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.759
Well, uh, he doesn't know
l sold the car.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.953
Um, he doesn't know
l'm on the team.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.389
He thinks l'm off to Miami...

32:57.520 --> 32:59.317
and l loaned the car
to a friend...

32:59.440 --> 33:03.353
to work for Webster, Webster
and Cohen, someplace like that.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.274
Some people say you know

34:40.280 --> 34:43.237
Sanka, man, what you smokin'?

34:43.360 --> 34:45.873

34:48.600 --> 34:52.275
- All right, fellas,

- Move! Let's go! Move!

34:52.400 --> 34:54.594
- Aah! Me first!
- What's the matter? You guys cold?

34:56.120 --> 34:59.192
lt's not so much the heat; it's
the humidity that'll kill you.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.000
Excuse me, do you know where
you can register for bobsled?

35:51.360 --> 35:53.635
Do you know where you

35:59.240 --> 36:01.037

Well, what do you know?

36:32.600 --> 36:35.398
Your judges will be Shindler,
Gremmer and Kroychzech.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.229
- l know Kroychzech. He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

36:39.360 --> 36:44.480
ln order to qualify, you must

minute, 2 seconds-flat or under.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.319
- Used to be a minute, five.
- Yeah.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.431
Times change.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.552
- lrv, is that you?
- Roger, how you doing?

36:57.680 --> 36:59.989
Hello, Kurt.
Been a long time.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.875
Obviously not long enough.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.788
- Hello, Larry.
- Jesus Christ, lrv.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.990
What the hell did you
do to yourself?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.434
- Don't worry about them, lrv.
- Roger, you got to do me a favour.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.869
- What?
- Please. You know that
revolving restaurant thing?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.797
- Yeah.
- Meet me there in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

37:19.920 --> 37:22.070
- Yeah. Please!
- Roger, come on!

37:22.200 --> 37:23.997

37:39.800 --> 37:43.349
- Thanks, Roger.
- Yeah, well-- What's up, lrv?

37:43.480 --> 37:45.277
- How about a drink?
- No, l'm fine.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.709
- What's so important
that it couldn't wait?
- Want something to eat?

37:47.840 --> 37:50.513
- No, l'm fine!
- A salad or something?
- lrv!

37:52.800 --> 37:57.430
- l need a sled.
- You came all the way
to Calgary without a sled?

37:57.560 --> 38:00.791
l got 4,800 dollars.
l just need something competitive.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.878
- For five grand?
- l know you got something
lying around, Roger.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.797
- But, lrv--
- Anything.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.230
- You know l can't do that.
- Now, wait a minute, Roger.

38:09.360 --> 38:13.353
Remember when you were desperate
to make that last slot on the
'68 Grenoble team...

38:13.480 --> 38:15.391
and you pleaded with me
to talk to Kurt?

38:15.520 --> 38:17.715
Did l say, ''Sorry, Roger,
l can't do it''?

38:17.840 --> 38:20.673
Come on, don't make me beg.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.553
Roger, it's me.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.717
All right, maybe l can get you
one of our practise sleds.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.593
You're a saint, you know that?
A saint! You haven't changed
a bit! You're still a saint!

38:29.720 --> 38:32.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look, don't get
all mushy on me. Just tell me one thing.

38:32.920 --> 38:37.436
ls this whole thing a big joke,
or do you really expect these
Jamaicans to qualify?

38:37.560 --> 38:41.473
Not only are they going to
qualify, they're going to
turn some heads doing it.

38:41.600 --> 38:46.549
Listen, three of these guys
can run the hundred in under ten-flat.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.989
l don't care who you are,
that's lightning.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.157
Yeah, but can lightning
run on ice?

39:10.400 --> 39:12.197
No problem, man.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.917
God!

39:25.560 --> 39:29.109
lrv, these special shoes
aren't very effective.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.074
Grip with your toes!

39:42.200 --> 39:44.714
All right, you sugar-coated
track stars!

39:44.840 --> 39:48.310
Move out and let the ice rasta
show you how it's done.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.915
- Yeah. Like that, yeah. Good.
- Hey, fellas!

39:54.040 --> 39:56.634
- Look at my progress.
- Stop touching me!

40:04.800 --> 40:09.271
All right, fellas, that's it!
Let's get off the ice before practise.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.278
- What practise?
- That practise.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.957
That's right.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.357
Good team this year.

41:10.840 --> 41:15.391
Ein, zwei, drei!

42:29.640 --> 42:32.518
Oh, man, you should see this
on the hill.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.029
- lt's like a miracle.
- What's ''Schweiz''?

42:35.160 --> 42:38.755
- No, man! Swiss!
- This is the real thing, man.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.950
Gentlemen...

42:41.080 --> 42:44.072
l'd like to introduce you to
the newest member of our team.

42:48.840 --> 42:54.073
Um, you won't believe what l
had to go through to get us
a sled in such good shape.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.918
Uh--

42:57.240 --> 42:59.754
lf we're going to make it
into the Olympics...

42:59.880 --> 43:02.952
this is the boat that's
going to take us there.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.435
Well, l'm-- l'm told
she's actually quite fast.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.914
l, uh, know she's not
much to look at...

43:11.040 --> 43:14.396
- but, uh--
- Shh! She's beautiful!

43:26.280 --> 43:30.159
All coaches must sign teams in
before approaching bob run.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.317
Here we go.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.317
Let's go! Let's go!

43:58.240 --> 44:00.037
- Hold on a minute.
- All right, come on.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.957
Here we go.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.834
Ah. This is good.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.070
Okay, this is it.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.317
- Everybody climb in.
- Hold up. l don't understand.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.398
- We're not going to push start?
- No, we're going to push start
next time.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.750
For your first run, l'm just going
to nudge you off, okay? Everybody in.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.677
Let's go, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.750
- Don't touch me!
- Hey, Baldy, get off my foot!

44:45.880 --> 44:47.677
- Don't touch me!
- Here you go. Come on.

44:47.800 --> 44:51.998
Hey, Blitzer, why don't you put
some training wheels on that sled?

44:53.200 --> 44:55.475
That's funny. Very funny.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.750
You want to kiss my egg?

44:57.880 --> 45:00.474
l'm not kissing no egg.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.397
- Suit yourself.
- Now, listen up, fellas.

45:02.520 --> 45:06.229
- l don't want you to worry
about looking good out there.
- Ah, Blitzie.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.238
You going to tuck them in too?

45:09.360 --> 45:12.193
Hey-- Seeming to you
like nobody likes us?

45:12.320 --> 45:16.279
We're different. People are always
afraid of what's different.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.550
Hey, Jamaica.

45:18.680 --> 45:22.036
Watch out for number 12 turn.
lt's scary, huh?

45:23.880 --> 45:26.440
- What's his problem?
- He's Josef Grool.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.312
He's one of the best drivers
in the world.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.715
Yeah, he's one of the biggest
assholes in the world too.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.910
Well, don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.031
Derice, right here.
You got it?

45:35.160 --> 45:39.517
Remember, keep your hands soft
and your mind clear.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.030
- High in, low out. What is it?
- High in, low out.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.958
All right, put your helmets on,
everybody! Let's go!

45:46.080 --> 45:48.958
Here we go! Come on!
Helmets on!

45:50.800 --> 45:52.279
- Hey, Coach.
- Yeah?

45:52.400 --> 45:55.392
l can't get my helmet on!
Oh, thanks, Coach.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.080
- That's what l'm here for.
- Oh. Coach?

45:58.200 --> 46:00.760
- Yeah.
- l got to go, you know.

46:00.880 --> 46:04.156
- Hold it.
- Hold it?
- Hold it.
- Hold it?

46:04.280 --> 46:08.831
- Yeah, hold it!
- B-But, Coach, l can't hold it!
We're not bobsledding yet.

46:08.960 --> 46:12.430
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Coach! Coach!

46:14.800 --> 46:16.597
Coach!

46:18.240 --> 46:19.673
Coach! Coach!

Bob in track.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.037
Coach!

46:38.040 --> 46:41.237
Slow down! Oh! Slow it down!
Slow down! Slow it down!

46:41.360 --> 46:44.477
Oh, my god! Oh!
Oh, Derice! Oh, Derice!

46:44.600 --> 46:48.593
l hate you!
l hate you! l hate you!

46:48.720 --> 46:49.948
Whoa!

47:01.240 --> 47:03.071
Sanka, you dead?

47:04.400 --> 47:06.755
Yeah, man.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.075
Well, you can pee now.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.956
Ohh. Too late.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.397
This is embarrassing.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.675
Man, shut down that
hot plate, fool.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.950
Those bananas are stinking
like a dead dog.

47:28.080 --> 47:31.993
Back off! Back off, you eight-ball!
This is my mama's secret recipe.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.669
And l hope you don't mind keeping quiet
while l catch up on my reading.

47:35.800 --> 47:39.236
What are you talking about, reading?
This is a children's book.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.590
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.951
Well, if it's a children's book,
that means it's too advanced
for the likes of you.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.789
What are you trying to say, that l'm
not smarter than a little child?

47:48.920 --> 47:50.990
No, what l am saying to you...

47:51.120 --> 47:55.557
is that you are the kind of
club-totin', raw meat-eatin',
me-Tarzan-you-Jane-in'...

47:55.680 --> 48:00.356
big, bald bubblehead that
can only count to ten if he's
barefoot or wearing sandals.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.313
Say whatever it is
that you want...

48:03.440 --> 48:06.477
'cause you're just like every
other fool on the island.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.791
You're going nowhere, Sanka,
and you're thrilled to death about it.

48:14.200 --> 48:17.715
But you see me?
You see me?

48:17.840 --> 48:21.276
l'm different,
'cause l know exactly...

48:21.400 --> 48:23.391
where l'm going...

48:23.520 --> 48:28.913
and after l, Yul Brenner, win
the Olympics and become famous...

48:29.040 --> 48:30.837
l'm going to leave the island...

48:32.120 --> 48:34.873
and live right down there.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.035
What are you laughing about?

48:42.160 --> 48:44.515
- What are you laughing about?
- That's Buckingham Palace.

48:46.680 --> 48:49.877
You plan on living there, you're
going to have to marry the Queen.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.958
Yul, that's where
the Queen of England lives.

48:57.720 --> 49:01.633
Face it, Yul Brenner-- You can
start calling yourself Madonna...

49:01.760 --> 49:06.356
but you're still going to end up
in an outhouse shanty like every
other dock-working nobody.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.756
- Mm, says who?
- Says me, rich boy.
What do you know about it?

49:09.880 --> 49:12.838
Well, l know my father
started off in a one-room hut.

49:12.960 --> 49:17.431
- Now he lives in one of the
biggest homes in Kingston.
- Well, he ain't your father.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.949
He doesn't have to be.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.197
All he has to do is know what
he wants and work hard for it.

49:23.320 --> 49:26.437
And if he wants it bad enough,
he'll get it.

49:27.640 --> 49:31.189
Look, believe me, Sanka...

49:31.320 --> 49:34.039
the more Yul Brenners we got
making it in this world...

49:34.160 --> 49:38.870
the better off this world will
be, especially for Jamaicans.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.715
Go ahead, Yul Brenner.

49:56.840 --> 49:58.637
Go get your palace.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.117
Move! Move!

50:14.440 --> 50:16.237
Bob in track.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.033
What do you have in there,
a baby?

50:26.560 --> 50:29.358
-l can't believe you're still cold, man.
-Cold?

50:29.480 --> 50:32.631
l'm freezing my royal
Rastafarian nay-nays off!

50:32.760 --> 50:34.876
All right, we're up!
Let's go, guys, this is it!

50:35.000 --> 50:36.797
Give me that!

50:36.920 --> 50:41.914
Okay, now, this is our first real push
start. But don't worry about it, okay?

50:42.040 --> 50:44.554
l-lt's no different
than what we've practised.
We've done it a hundred times.

50:44.680 --> 50:46.193
Derice.
Right here.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.311
- Okay, get your helmets on.
- Coach!

50:48.440 --> 50:49.919
- Okay, okay.
- Thanks, Coach.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.110
All right, let's go, Derice.
lt's yours.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.152
- Ridiculous. What's he doing?
- Ready?

50:55.280 --> 50:57.111
One...

50:57.240 --> 50:58.673
two...

50:58.800 --> 51:00.677
three!

51:00.800 --> 51:03.837
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Hold on! Wait! Hold on!

51:03.960 --> 51:07.032
Now! Now! Now!

51:07.160 --> 51:08.957
Now!

51:40.360 --> 51:43.989
- Those guys are
pretty good, aren't they?
- Good? They're the best.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.670
So you guys been having a
little trouble out there, huh?

51:47.800 --> 51:50.360
- Ah, we'll be fine.
- l sure hope so.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.392
That'd be a real shame
to waste all that talent.

51:53.520 --> 51:56.273
l'm not worried.
And we have a good coach.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.911
Kid, l hate to say it,
but, uh, you got to wake up.

52:02.040 --> 52:07.194
Coach Blitzer is what's killing
you; he's been useless since
the day he was busted.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.710
- What you mean, ''busted''?
- The '72 Games.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.230
The guy hid weights in the front
of the sled to make it go faster.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.076
So what? lt's no big deal.

52:19.200 --> 52:23.352
Having your gold medals taken away
for cheating is a big deal.

52:25.040 --> 52:27.429
Derice! Let's go.
We got a meeting.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.270
Giving my kid
a few pointers, Larry?

52:43.360 --> 52:45.920
''Your kid'' is going to need
all the help he can get...

52:50.600 --> 52:52.397
Coach.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.074
Maid service, sir. Would you
like your bed turned down?

53:01.200 --> 53:04.272
Mint? Perhaps l could
dust your head.

53:04.400 --> 53:07.233
Whatever's wrong with you
is no little thing.

53:09.600 --> 53:13.275
Hurry up, man. l have a dead
grandmother that moves faster than you.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.197
Wait, wait.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.157
What that fool want now?

53:19.840 --> 53:21.876
What?

53:22.000 --> 53:23.797
Sorry.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.791
- What do you have there, man?
- A telegram.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.673
l know it's a telegram.
What does it say?

53:38.360 --> 53:40.794
lt's from my father.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.673
He says l have to come home
right now.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.156
Workin'

53:56.280 --> 53:58.953
Workin' for my payday

54:00.120 --> 54:01.951
Every time payday comes

54:02.080 --> 54:04.310
You know l'm down
to my last

54:06.040 --> 54:08.600
Well, l'm dreamin'

54:08.720 --> 54:11.029
Dreamin' of you all day

54:12.600 --> 54:17.515
When the work day's done
we're gonna love that night away

54:18.920 --> 54:22.390
'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast

54:22.520 --> 54:24.954
When we finally make it
we can both look back

54:25.080 --> 54:27.913
On these hard times

54:28.040 --> 54:30.270
- Just for a laugh
- Hi!

54:30.400 --> 54:34.712
- Howdy, partner.
- 'Cause when you got love
you don't need too much money

54:34.840 --> 54:37.400
l'm in love with you
and don't you know, honey

54:37.600 --> 54:40.194
We're goin' nowhere

54:40.320 --> 54:44.950
- And we're gettin' there fast
- You've worked too hard and too long!

54:45.080 --> 54:47.958
And let me tell you
something else, Junior Bevil.

54:48.080 --> 54:51.675
lf it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be here right now.

54:51.800 --> 54:54.951
Oh, wait.
But you don't understand.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.116
He is really mad.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.834
l mean, you don't know him
like l do, you know.

54:59.960 --> 55:02.599
l think l'd better just
do what he wants...

55:02.720 --> 55:04.517
and go back home.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.949
And forget about your teammates.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.036
Blood fire!

55:09.160 --> 55:12.948
The man, you act like he's
the king of the whole world.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.799
But what should l do?
What should l do?

55:15.920 --> 55:21.119
Hey, Jamaica, keep it down!
You are not owning this place.

55:21.240 --> 55:24.550
Sorry, sir, sorry. l didn't--
l didn't mean to bother anyone.

55:25.880 --> 55:28.519
You have no business here,
Jamaica.

55:28.640 --> 55:32.269
You and your stupid friend
playing like you are bobsledders, ja.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.392
Why don't you tourists go back
to where it is you came from...

55:35.520 --> 55:38.876
and leave the bobsledding
to the real men.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.911
Well, l'm, uh--
l'm a real man.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.713
You want to say something,
Jamaica? Come on, out with it.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.035
You know that money can't buy

55:47.760 --> 55:49.432
This feeling

55:49.560 --> 55:53.712
That we're sharing tonight

55:53.840 --> 55:58.038
'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast

55:58.160 --> 56:00.594
Come on, man.
Come on! Right now!

56:05.560 --> 56:08.028
Now, look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.509
- l see Junior.
- You see Junior.

56:11.640 --> 56:16.953
Well, you want to know what l
see? l see pride. l see power!

56:17.080 --> 56:21.312
l see a badass mother who don't
take no crap off nobody!

56:22.680 --> 56:25.240
- You really see all that?
- Yeah, man.

56:25.360 --> 56:29.592
But it's not about what l see.
lt's about what you see.

56:29.720 --> 56:33.508
Now, look in this mirror and
tell me again what you see.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.437
l see--

56:37.800 --> 56:41.110
- Pride!
- Pride! Right.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.515
- Power!
- Power.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.551
- And l see--
- A badass mother--

56:45.680 --> 56:47.796
- Who don't take no crap--
- Off of nobody!

56:47.920 --> 56:49.399
- Again!
- l see pride!

56:49.520 --> 56:51.317
- Can't hear you!
- l see power!

56:51.440 --> 56:54.830
l see a badass mother
who won't take no crap off of nobody!

56:54.960 --> 56:56.473
- Once again!
- l see pride!

56:56.600 --> 56:58.158
- Junior!
- l see power!

56:58.280 --> 57:01.590
l see a badass mother
who won't take no crap off of nobody!

57:01.720 --> 57:04.314
- That's right!
- That's right! Junior Bevil!

57:04.440 --> 57:06.396
Where ya-- W--
Where he going?

57:17.920 --> 57:20.150
Pride. Power. Pride.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.517
Now, you listen to me, buddy.

57:23.640 --> 57:27.553
l will not be talked to that
way, so you'd better come up
with a damn good apology...

57:27.680 --> 57:30.592
- or else.
- Or else what?

57:30.720 --> 57:32.438
Ow.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.278
Eh, Jamaica?

57:34.400 --> 57:36.197
Or else what?

57:39.960 --> 57:41.757
Come on, Jamaica.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.074
Say something.

57:48.560 --> 57:50.357
No problem, man.

58:09.800 --> 58:11.631
Excuse me, missy!

58:18.040 --> 58:19.837
That hurt! Get off!

58:22.360 --> 58:24.635
l can't believe this.

58:24.760 --> 58:26.830
l just can't believe this.

58:26.960 --> 58:30.270
Didn't one of you have the sense
to know better? Go on. Laugh.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.197
l wanna see who's laughin'
when lrv gets here.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.117
Now wait, wait.

58:34.240 --> 58:37.789
When that East German fellow
go out and push my teammate...

58:37.920 --> 58:40.878
then blood fire,
we have to fight back.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.309
You don't see the Swiss
team fightin', do you?

58:43.440 --> 58:46.989
You don't see the Swiss team
drinkin' and carryin' on and such.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.634
And you don't see the Swiss
team smilin' neither.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.639
ln fact, if one of those Swiss boys
ever come across a pretty girl...

58:53.760 --> 58:56.558
he probably yell,
''Eins, zwei, drei...''

58:56.680 --> 58:58.477
and try to push her
down some ice.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.473
- What happened?
- Oh, l took care of the whole thing.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.477
l told the owner of the bar
these guys were...

59:06.600 --> 59:08.989
mentally disturbed, so he's
not gonna press any charges.

59:09.120 --> 59:11.190
All right, sled god
does it again.

59:11.320 --> 59:13.709
Just shut up, Sanka.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.751
Now maybe you
haven't noticed...

59:15.880 --> 59:19.475
but we aren't exactly winning
any popularity contests here.

59:19.600 --> 59:24.151
They hate me, they hate you,
they hate us.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.635
Now, if we're even gonna
think about qualifying...

59:26.760 --> 59:30.799
we're each gonna have to sit down
and take a nice, deep look inside.

59:30.920 --> 59:33.354
l didn't come all this way
to get my butt whipped.

59:33.480 --> 59:37.951
As a matter of fact, now that
l'm here, l thought l'd do
a little whippin' of my own.

59:38.080 --> 59:39.877
Good night, gentlemen.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.396
Rise and shine!

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.317
lt's butt-whipping time.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.917
Rise above it

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.191
Rise above it

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.596
Not bad.
Pick it up though.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.756
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Now, now, now!

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.795
Just rise above it
Come on and rise above it

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.595
- Good. That's it.
- Even though the road
seems very long and narrow

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.598
- Five more. Come on. Five more.
Push it, push it. Come on.
- Baby need to sharpen his pin

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.996
- Just like an arrow
- That's it, that's it.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.190
- Got-a no place to go
- That's it. Good, good.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.675
- Good. You're doin' fine.
You got anymore?
- Believe us, baby

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.519
Come on! Come on! Get in!

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.074
Oh! Wait! Hey! Help!

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.113
You gotta learn to
believe in yourself, yeah

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.153
Listen, little man, there ain't
nothin' you can't achieve if
you work hard and sacrifice

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.510
- Hear me now
- lf you've got a problem

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.438
- You've got to rise above it
Yes, you do
- Go, go, go, go, go! That's it.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.028
- And when you face a challenge
- You gotta grip with your toes. Go! Go!

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.879
- You got to rise above it lt's so large
- Now! Now!

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.560
lf those storm clouds
reappear, oh, yes

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.150
You don't ever have to fear
Just rise above it

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.748
- You have got to
- Rise above it

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.749
l tell ya once
and l tell ya twice

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.677
You know, you're gonna have to
do this on your own one day.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.791
Just one man
and a thousand eyes

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.354
Come now, come now
and take my advice

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.835
Rise above it

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.474
Rise above it

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.397
- Rise above it
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.715
Now, now, now, now, now!

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.195
- Straight. Right.
- Turn six. Turn seven.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.117
- Straight. Right.
- Turn eight.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.674
- Follow me, follow me
follow me, follow me
- Rise above it

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.473
- That's it! That's it! That's it!
- Rise above it

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.514
- Rise above it
- You can do it

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.074
- Rise above it
- You can do it

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.800
Okay, guys.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.037
Tonight's the night.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.196
Now in a few minutes, you're gonna
get a chance to do something...

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.630
that no one in your country
has ever done.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.876
l was gonna save this for
the Olympics, but l figure...

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.275
if we're going to convince
these judges...

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.676
that we are
world-class sledders...

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.519
then we had better look
like world-class sledders.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.516
- Whoa, man.
- Yes.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.437
Nice.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.071
l freeze in this.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.757
Bob in track.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.389
Hello, gentlemen.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.354
lrv, this is Karl Shindler.
He'll be watching the middle track.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.710
- How do you do?
- And this is August Gremmer.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.796
He'll be judging
the push starts.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.912
- Hi.
- l'm your third official
up in the tower.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.673
You. What happened
to Kroychzech?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.598
He came down sick this morning.
l'm taking his place.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.511
Oh, goody.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.438
Oh, the Alliance has decided
to change the qualifying time...

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.074
from a minute-two
to a minute-flat.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.997
ls that clear?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.829
No problem, man.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.034
Go get 'em, kid.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.671
Track is clear
for Jamaica One.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.754
Eins, zwei, drei.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.031
Go, go, go!
Now, now, now, now!

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.392
- All right, what was that time?
- 6.13.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.759
Under 60?
ls it under 60?

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.997
59-point-si--!

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.439
l'm, uh-- l'm sorry.
l'm outta here. That's terrific.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.390
Derice!

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.791
- Ah, no, it's great.
- They couldn't beat us.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.673
- l know we were the best.
- Yeah.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.031
- ...inspired you guys, that's all.
- You were great, all of ya.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.438
Nobody had that much fun
in a sled since Santy Claus.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.710
Fellas, here's to
followin' your dreams.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.831
- Yeah, man.
- Followin' your dreams.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.679
l said it to your father the first time
l met him, and l'll say it again.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.870
Sprinters make
the best bobsledders.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.514
Here's to sprinting.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.234
So what are we gonna
name the sled?

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.954
How about ''Tallulah''?

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.756
- That's hot. Tallulah.
- Tallulah. Tallulah.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.270
Sounds like a two-dollar hooker.
How you come up with that?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.914
Hey, you idiot,
that's my mother's name.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.395
- lt's a pretty name.
- Tallulah. l like that.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.476
So what's it gonna be, star?

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.956
What are the people gonna be screamin'
when Jamaica takes the hill?

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.277
l say we call it
''Cool Runnings.''

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.277
- Beautiful.
- l like it.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.550
- lt's very strong.
- Nice. Very nice.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.353
Uh, what exactly
does it mean?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.597
''Cool runnings'' means
''Peace be the journey.''

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.597
- Peace be the journey.
- Peace be the journey.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.790
- Cool runnings.
- Cool runnings.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.229
- Cool runnings.
- E-Excuse me.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.510
To the man
in the orange suit!

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.837
To the orange!
To the man in the orange!

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.157
- To the messenger.
- To the messenger.
- To the messenger.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.276
We are officially
disqualified.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.190
Excuse me, gentlemen. Kurt,
l really have to talk to you.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.437
Excuse me, lrv. l've
nothing to say to you.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.357
Yes, you do.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.040
- l want to know why
you disqualified my guys.
- As you were told...

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.835
your team must compete in
an international race in order
to qualify for the Olympics.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.757
But in an Olympic year...

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.110
the qualifiers count
as an international race.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.629
That may have been true
in past Olympic years...

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.957
but this year, the Alliance
decided to change its policy.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.878
Oh, please!
Change its policy?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.913
The Alliance has the right to do
whatever they feel is in the
best interest of the sport.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.556
We must also be concerned about
the potential for embarrassment.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.750
Oh, forgive me.
l didn't realize...

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.838
that four black guys in
a bobsled could make you blush.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.428
l think we've heard enough.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.030
Come on, Kurt. What you're doin'
is wrong and you know it.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.957
Now, if this is about
you and me...

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.913
then let's get it straight
right now.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.749
All right, 16 years ago, l made
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.031
l cheated.
l was stupid.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.755
l embarrassed myself,
my family...

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.997
my teammates,
my country and my coach.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.992
lf it's revenge you want,
take it.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.032
Go ahead.
Disqualify me. Banish me.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.991
Do whatever you want,
but do it to me.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.398
lt was me who let you down,
Kurt. lt wasn't my guys.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.475
They've done everything you've
asked of them, and they did it...

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.513
with all of you
laughing in their face.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.837
Hell, it doesn't matter
if they come in first or 50th.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.111
Those guys have earned the right
to represent their country.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.037
They've earned the right...

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.709
to march into that stadium
and wave their nation's flag.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.796
That's the single
greatest honour...

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.716
an athlete
could ever have.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.354
That's what the Olympics
are about.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.435
Sixteen years ago,
l forgot that.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.756
Don't you go
and do the same.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.511
Sorry if l interrupted
your meeting.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.474
Hello. Yes?

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.716
Yeah.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.277
Right. Goodbye.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.395
- What?
- That was the Alliance.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.795
- God.
- What did they say?

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.031
Oh, they said
we're back in.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.356
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.714
And a lot is expected
of the ltalian team.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.035
Did l miss it?
Did l miss it?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.993
No, child.
You didn't miss a thing.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.714
...of Jamaica made it
all the way here to Calgary...

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.751
to compete
in the bobsled event.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.758
Their flag bearer is
the sled captain Derice Bannock.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.952
Derice's father, Ben Bannock, was
a gold medalist in the 200 metres...

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.674
at the Summer Olympic games
over 20 years ago.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.190
And perhaps there's gold in
two generations of this family.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.073
That's quite a story.
The Jamaican bobsled team.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.749
lt's a beautiful afternoon in Calgary,
and there is a lot more coming up.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.871
So stay tuned for
more exciting coverage...

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.276
of the opening ceremonies
of the 15th Winter Olympiad...

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.755
from Calgary,
Alberta, Canada.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.914
Gentlemen, let's go
check into our new home.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.837
Come on, Junior.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.477
Junior! Hey!

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.197
Junior.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.709
Now a lot of coaches would be
giving you one of those, uh...

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.400
''Win one for the Gipper''
speeches.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.398
l'm not good at that stuff.
lnstead, l thought l'd, uh...

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.034
lead you in a psalm
of inspiration.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.957
Let's bow our heads.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.991
Who's the ''Gipper''?

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.796
Our Father who art in Calgary,
bobsled be Thy name.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.798
Thy kingdom come,
gold medals won...

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.070
on Earth as it is
in turn seven.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.873
With liberty and justice
for Jamaica and Haile Selassie.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.309
- Amen.
- All right!

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.635
- Yes!
- Respect.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.557
- All right.
- Jah Rastafari.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.397
Junior.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.677
Now you listen to me, boy.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.315
You might not have done
what you were asked...

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.000
but you will do
what you're told.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.588
- You're coming home.
- Yeah, but, Father,
you know l just want--

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.836
But nothing.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.030
l didn't send you
to the finest school...

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.073
for you to go around
sliding on your backside.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.873
- You must be mad.
- Yeah, but the team needs me.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.434
l don't want to hear
any more of it.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.637
Go and get your things.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.677
l'll wait in the lobby.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.594
Pride. Power.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.919
Father, when you look
at me, what do you see?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.076
l don't have time
for games, Junior.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.031
Tell me what ya see!

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.594
Please.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.597
All right, l'll tell you
what l see.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.517
l see a lost little boy...

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.428
who's lucky to have a father
who knows what's best for him.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.235
No, no, no, no. You don't know
what's best for me, Father.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.397
l am not a lost
little boy, Father.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.317
l am a man.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.431
And l'm an Olympian.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.156
l'm stayin' right here.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.353
Hey, Junior Bevil.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.436
You're a badass mother.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.471
- Here, l-l got a couple.
- l like this one. Yes.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.077
O Canada, indeed. This is Al Trautwig
along with John Morgan.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.714
We're live at Olympic Park,
the brand-new bobsledding venue...

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.990
just a few miles outside
of downtown Calgary.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.350
Everybody, shut up.
lt's starting.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.517
...extremely intense, exciting
competition for the next three days.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.872
l am feeling very Olympic
today. How about you?

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.919
Uh, this sport, as we well know,
us made up of athletes...

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.508
who go to the edge and sometimes
beyond, and it is why we believe...

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.632
the next three days is going to be
extremely competitive and exciting.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:55.911
And already, John, on day one,
we're starting things off
with a gold medal favourite.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.952
Well, the Swiss were fortunate enough
to draw number one in the competition.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.230
We gotta make them the odds-on
favourite to win the gold.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.432
But the East Germans, they're comin'
off the gold medal win in 1984.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.790
The Canadians, it's their home track.
You gotta favour them too.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.150
And they've been doin'
very well in practise all week.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.918
Eins, zwei, drei.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.518
One! Two! Three! Go!

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.031
- Eighty miles an hour or close to it.
- You know, Al,

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.674
l'm lookin' at the times here, and
the course is gettin' extremely fast.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.791
And l was worried about that Austrian
team's safety in that last big...

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.718
180-degree whiparound that draws
four G's of force on the athletes.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.071
Well, if you were worried about
them, what are you thinking
about our last and next team?

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.431
Yes, it certainly seems
strange that surrounded by
the ice and snow of Calgary,

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.269
we are about to watch a team
from the tiny island of Jamaica.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.073
- From Jamaica!
- Quite a story for them
to even get here.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.317
They came out of nowhere. And
you know, there's a lot of teams
up here on top of the hill...

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.113
that sort of feel the Jamaicans
don't belong here.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.834
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, what are you doin', man?

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.713
- What are you doing?
- That's what the Swiss do
to psych themselves up.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.230
They also make them little pocketknives,
too, but l don't see you doin' that.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.591
All right, guys, we're up. Come on. Hey,
knock it off. Knock it off, will ya?

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.836
Okay. Let's go.
Come on.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.669
Take your start positions.
Remember, we don't have to win
the gold in the first day.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.791
- lt's just like any other run.
- Except this time...

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.797
100 million people watching.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.718
Derice, did you forget
something? Thank you.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.671
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.358
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.678
Eins, zwei, drei.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.878
Go! Go, go, go, go! Go!

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.391
- Get in! Get in!
- As the Jamaican team attempts
its first ever...

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.875
winter Olympic event,
and look at this.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.276
They've gotta get into that sled.
l've never seen anything like this.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.358
l know it's not funny,
but how embarrassing.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.074
Now, thank goodness. For
a minute, l didn't think they'd
ever get all four of them in.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.668
And that could've been
a disaster.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.268
C-Come on!

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.197
Well, most importantly here,
when you do get in the sled...

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.595
you have to get in with catlike
movements, get in, get relaxed.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.838
Ooh, look at that high line at
Omega! He bounces off the wall,
ricochets like a pinball.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.997
You know, the driver here,
Derice Bannock, looks like
the sled's really drivin' him.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.432
- That fool better watch his mouth.
- He better watch more than that.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.155
This is the time when this team
may be thinking, ''This may not
have been such a great idea.''

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.236
Their heads are bouncing around.
This is amazing.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.590
Like rag dolls as they come
through the finish...

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.632
at a time of 58.04...

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.274
which will be good enough
for last place.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.594
You choked. lt was yours for
the taking, and you choked.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.154
You were ready,
and ya choked.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.989
Well, maybe we should
go over the turns again?

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.236
You know the turns.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.669
You know everything there is
to know about this sport.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.439
l'll tell you somethin'.
You had all better figure out...

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.199
how to stay loose out there.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.710
That's somethin'
l can't help you with.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.400
l'll see you tomorrow
on the hill.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.039
You know, when the Swiss
want to get relaxed--

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.993
Will you shut up
about the damn Swiss?

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.318
l mean, it was all that ''eins,
zwei, drei'' nonsense that got us
all nervous in the first place.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.193
Hey, man, look here. l'm just tryin'
to get us off on the right foot.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.073
Well, the right foot for us
is not the Swiss foot.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.352
l mean, come on, Derice. We
can't be copyin' nobody else's
style. We have our own style.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.630
Kissin' an egg
is no kind of style.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.911
lt's the Olympics here.
lt's no stupid pushcart derby.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.076
Let me tell ya
somethin', Rasta.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.033
l didn't come up here to forget
who l am and where l come from.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.119
And neither did l. l'm just
tryin' to be the best l can be.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.550
So am l. And the best
l can be is Jamaican.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.237
Look. Derice, l've known you since Julie
Jeffries asked to see your ding-a-ling.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.874
And l'm telling you
as a friend...

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.514
if we look Jamaican,
walk Jamaican...

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.108
talk Jamaican
and is Jamaican...

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.437
then we sure as hell
better bobsled Jamaican.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.876
Greetings from Jamaica

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.389
'Nuff people will say
you know they can't believe

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.715
Jamaica we have
a bobsled team

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.910
'Nuff people say
you know they can't believe

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.996
Jamaica we have
a bobsled team

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.350
We have the one Derice
and the one Junior

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.630
- Thank you.
- Yul Brenner and the man Sanka

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.149
The fastest of the fastest
of Jamaican sprinters

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.157
Respect to the man
lrv Blitzer

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.430
- All right, gentlemen, this is it.
- Respect.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.437
- Respect! Whoo!
- All right.
- Let's go!

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.189
We now come to the second chance for
the four intrepid men from Jamaica.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.039
- What do they have to do, John?
- ln reality, Al, l don't think
the Jamaicans...

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.549
- have any chance of winning a medal.
- Dear God!

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.513
Just let them be better
than yesterday.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.676
- Ready.
- Ready.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.439
Feel the rhythm!
Feel the rhyme!

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.120
Get on up!
lt's bobsled time!

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.437
Cool runnings!

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.518
Bob in track.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.996
That's a hair faster than the
Swiss. Boy, that's a real big
difference from yesterday.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.076
Well, this is an absolute shock
in the making. Yesterday...

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.350
- they were falling down
almost at the start.
- Yes!

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.438
Now they slide into place. Yesterday,
their heads were bobbing everywhere.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.711
Today, they're
almost in unison.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.710
- Can this really be happening?
- Boy, what a difference!

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:17.594
Flying through the Omega,
looking possessed here. lt's not
the same team we saw yesterday.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.553
- Where did these guys come from?
- Jamaica!

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.518
Wow! 56.53!

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.915
Whoo-hoo! Yes! Yes!

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.793
- Did you hear that time? Yes!
- Yeah.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.951
- That moves them up into 8th place.
- Watch out, world.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.674
The Jamaicans are coming.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.117
Derice, you in here?

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.310
Hey, Coach.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.477
Oh, there ya are.
How you feelin'?

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.397
- All right.
- Good, good.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.909
You all set to follow
in your father's footsteps?

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.112
- l think so.
- You think so?

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.038
- All right, l know so.
- That's more like it.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.594
We're gonna go grab a bite
to eat. You wanna join us?

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.280
- Nah.
- l didn't think so. l'll
pick you somethin' up.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.317
- Hey, Coach.
- Yeah.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.079
- l have to ask you a question.
- Sure.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.919
But you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.955
l mean, l want you to, but
if you can't, l understand.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.674
You wanna know why
l cheated, right?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.995
Yes, l do.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.877
That's a fair question.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.117
lt's quite simple, really.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.197
l had to win.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.956
You see, Derice...

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.310
l'd made winning
my whole life...

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.954
and when you make winning
your whole life...

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.514
ya have to keep on winning,
no matter what.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.557
You understand that?

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.114
No, l don't understand, Coach.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.516
You had two gold medals.
You had it all.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.277
Derice...

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.635
a gold medal
is a wonderful thing.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.432
But if you're not enough
without it...

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.233
you'll never be enough
with it.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.317
Hey, Coach...

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.517
how will l know
if l'm enough?

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.438
When you cross that
finish line, you'll know.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.271
Welcome back to the bobsledding
venue for this, the last day of
competition. lt's medal time...

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.437
and, John, the top six teams
are separated by only half a second.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.676
- So it's very close, and
that's been predictable--
- l didn't expect...

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.234
- to see you here.
- Well, my dear...

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.237
we've got a team
in the Olympics, don't we?

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.193
Most astonishing is the
Jamaicans. They still have a
chance to win an Olympic medal.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.710
Everybody, shut up.
My boy's on TV.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.796
And you're not the only one
to get excited about that.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.957
l think the fans here have an
extreme case of Jamaican fever.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.719
- Al, so do l.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.957
So do we. Do l have to tell you
whose turn it is now?

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.392
- Jamaica, to your start positions.
- Respect!

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.036
Hey, dreadlocks, let me
kiss your lucky egg.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.833
- Next team up is Jamaica.
- All right, fellas, that's us!

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.032
Let's go! Here we go!
Today's our day! This is it!

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.957
Come on, guys.
We can do it!

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.709
Derice! l'll see ya
at the finish line.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.593
- With the kinds of push starts
these guys are capable of...
- All right, it's all yours. Go!

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.156
we might actually see the
Jamaicans win an Olympic medal.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.317
So this is it. We could
see history in the making.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.113
Feel the rhythm!
Feel the rhyme!

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.038
Get on up!
lt's bobsled time!

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.072
- Cool runnings!
- On the track.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.317
Go! Go! Go!
Move that bobsled! Go!

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.000
One, two, three, four, all of
them in, and look at them fly.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.953
Oh, man, they shaved another
couple hundredths off the start.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.913
Al, they get better
every time down the track.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.272
Go, Derice! Move!
Take that bobsled and move!

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.472
Look at the way the sled's comin' in
and out of the corners. Very smooth.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.831
lt's like he's been drivin'
the sled for ten years. Bannock
looks really possessed here.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.155
Oh, what the heck.
Go, Jams!

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.911
What a run Bannock is having.
He's letting loose on this
extremely fast course.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.956
And even with that
rickety old sled...

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.312
the Jamaicans are
flying through the turns.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.159
This does not look good.
Something's gotta be wrong.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.829
The Jamaicans on a record pace
as they fly almost out of
control around the turn.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.757

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.877

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.149

All of the bad feelings

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.270

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.912

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.792
Look straight ahead

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.913

And the temperature ranges
from hot to hotter

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:07.752

a bobsled team

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.997

You see the world steady

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.630
When they make the motion
Them a rock and a dolly

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.716
A country on a sled
with a wish in them body

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.149
