WEBVTT

01:12.948 --> 01:14.407
Finished, sir?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.033
Yeah . Hey, do you have a light?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.209
Old Gold man , huh?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.337
Lucky Strike here.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.592
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

01:32.676 --> 01:34.969
I'm sorry, sir,
Is Sam here bothering you?

01:35.053 --> 01:37.722
He can be a little chatty.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.057
No, we're actually just
having a conversation .

01:40.142 --> 01:41.058
Is that okay?

01:41.143 --> 01:43.978
Can I get you another drink?

01:44.062 --> 01:47.064
Yeah. Do this again .
Old-fashioned , please.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.986
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.405
I guess. I don't know.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.990
But what is it? I mean , low-tar?

01:56.074 --> 01:56.991
Those new filters?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.451
Why-- I mean-- Why Old Gold?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.828
They gave 'em to us in the service--

02:00.913 --> 02:02.330
a carton a week for free.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.040
So you're used to 'em ,
is that it?

02:04.124 --> 02:07.001
Yeah . They're a habit.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.003
I could never get you
to try another brand--

02:09.087 --> 02:10.963
say, my Luckies?

02:11.048 --> 02:14.008
I love my Old Golds.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.887
All right, well, let's just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comes

02:17.971 --> 02:20.973
and eats every last
Old Gold on the planet.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.767
That's a sad story.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.645
It's a tragedy.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.104
Would you just stop smoking?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.858
I think I could find something .

02:30.943 --> 02:32.193
I love smoking .

02:32.277 --> 02:34.987
"I love smoking." That's very good .

02:35.072 --> 02:36.656
My wife hates it.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.866
Reader's Digest says it will kill you .

02:39.952 --> 02:41.118
Yeah, I heard about that.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.914
Ladies love their magazines.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.333
Yes, they do.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.076
You weren't worried
about waking me, were you?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.411
Am I interrupting anything?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.829
Mmm , no.

03:27.791 --> 03:32.712
You're lucky I'm still up working
and I'm alone.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.088
How's it going?

03:34.172 --> 03:37.925
They invented something called
Grandmother's Day.

03:38.010 --> 03:42.930
That ought to keep me busy
drawing puppies for a few months.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.932
Can I run a few ideas past you?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.851
Does that mean
what I think it means?

03:46.935 --> 03:50.021
Because I'm familiar
with most of your ideas.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.148
I'm having a situation
with my cigarette account.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.776
Wow, you really are here to talk.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.779
The Trade Commission is cracking down
on all of our health claims.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.990
I getReader's Digest.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.492
This is the same scare
you had five years ago.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.785
You dealt with it.

04:04.870 --> 04:08.164
I know I slept a lot better
knowing doctors smoke.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.206
Well, that's just it.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.501
The whole "safer cigarette"
thing is over.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.587
No more doctors,
no more testimonials,

04:14.671 --> 04:18.132
no more cough-free,
soothes your T-zone,

04:18.216 --> 04:20.176
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.011
Nothing .

04:22.095 --> 04:24.639
All I have is a crush-proof box

04:24.723 --> 04:28.184
and "four out of five
dead people smoke your brand ."

04:28.268 --> 04:30.019
Is this the part where I say,

04:30.103 --> 04:33.147
"Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,

04:33.231 --> 04:36.150
"and his big, strong brain will find a way

04:36.234 --> 04:38.277
to lead the sheep
to the slaughterhouse"?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.949
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.201
You gonna pitch to me or not?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.120
Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing .

04:48.205 --> 04:50.164
I am over, and they're
finally gonna know it.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.165
Next time you see me,

04:51.249 --> 04:52.875
there will be a bunch
of young executives

04:52.960 --> 04:54.126
picking meat off my ribs.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.295
That's a pretty picture.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.216
What's your secret?

05:02.427 --> 05:05.972
N ine different ways to say. . .

05:06.056 --> 05:09.433
"I love you , Grandma."

05:27.327 --> 05:30.079
We should get married .

05:31.540 --> 05:33.457
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?

05:33.542 --> 05:36.085
I'm serious.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.461
You have your own business.

05:37.546 --> 05:41.257
You don't mind when I come over.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.175
What size Cadillac do you take?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.220
You know the rules.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.555
I don't make plans,

05:47.639 --> 05:50.099
and I don't make breakfast.

05:54.479 --> 05:59.775
Sterling's having the tobacco people in
in nine hours, and I have nothing .

06:01.570 --> 06:03.112
People love smoking .

06:03.196 --> 06:06.240
There's nothing that you,
the Trade Commission ,

06:06.324 --> 06:09.493
orReader's Digest
can do to change that.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.127
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.129
looks where he's gonna put his plants.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.465
Is he handsome?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.945
23.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.072
Uh, not right away.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.740
Pal, could you take the long way up?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.284
I am really enjoying the view here.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.494
You going to Campbell's
bachelor party?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.745
Yeah , I want to be there

06:52.871 --> 06:55.956
before they tie an anchor around his neck
and drag him out to sea.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.291
I hear she's a nice girl .

06:57.375 --> 06:58.584
Eh, who wants that?

07:04.216 --> 07:05.758
What did you do that for?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.593
She'll probably be
assigned to one of us.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.303
Then she'll know what she's in for.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.514
You got to let them know
what kind of guy you are.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.307
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.310
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party soon.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.522
Yeah , well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.148
Excuse me. Is he expecting you?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.399
He's not expecting anything .

07:24.402 --> 07:27.321
Oh , honey, don't worry.
I'll get home safely.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.282
I have an important
appointment right now,

07:30.367 --> 07:32.326
so why don't you go
shopping or something?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.036
Take your mother to lunch .

07:34.121 --> 07:35.329
Tell her it was my idea.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.289
Wow. He's good .

07:37.374 --> 07:40.334
It's just a bachelor party, dear.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.045
No, I really don't know
what they have planned ,

07:43.171 --> 07:45.339
but judging from the creative brain power
around here,

07:45.423 --> 07:47.424
we'll probably end up
seeingMy Fair Lady.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.137
I'll tell you what.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.055
I'll drop by your place on my way home.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.431
Your mother can check
under my fingernails.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.978
Of course I love you .

07:59.062 --> 08:02.189
I'm giving up my life to be with you , aren't I?

08:05.527 --> 08:07.069
What a great gal .

08:08.446 --> 08:10.614
Tell ya, boys,

08:10.699 --> 08:12.366
she stole my heart.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.201
And her old man's loaded .

08:16.788 --> 08:18.414
Now, this is the executive floor.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.499
It should be organized , but it's not,

08:20.625 --> 08:24.962
so you'll find account executives
and creative executives all mixed in together.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.380
Please don't ask me the difference.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.381
Great.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.008
Hopefully, if you follow my lead ,

08:29.092 --> 08:31.051
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I've made here.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.761
- Hello, Joan .
- Like that one.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.390
So how many trains did it take you?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.392
Only one, but I got up very early.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.227
In a couple of years,
with the right moves,

08:40.312 --> 08:42.354
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.148
Of course, if you really make
the right moves,

08:44.232 --> 08:45.357
you'll be out in the country,

08:45.442 --> 08:48.194
and you won't be going to work at all.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.737
You'll be here just
across the aisle from me.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.406
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper
for the time being .

08:52.490 --> 08:55.743
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.953
Keep a fifth of something
in your desk.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.538
Mr. Draper drinks rye.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.750
Also, invest in some
aspirin , Band-Aids,

09:02.834 --> 09:04.793
and a needle and thread .

09:04.878 --> 09:05.836
Rye is Canadian, right?

09:05.921 --> 09:07.588
You better find out.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.424
He may act like he wants a secretary,

09:10.508 --> 09:11.634
but most of the time,

09:11.718 --> 09:14.553
they're looking for something
between a mother and a waitress.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.472
And the rest of the time, well . . .

09:22.062 --> 09:23.395
Go home, take a paper bag ,

09:23.480 --> 09:24.980
and cut some eyeholes out of it.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.774
Put it over your head , get undressed ,

09:26.858 --> 09:28.484
and look at yourself in the mirror.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.779
Really evaluate where your strengths
and weaknesses are,

09:31.863 --> 09:33.405
and be honest.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.449
I always try to be honest.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.326
Good for you .

09:38.536 --> 09:41.288
Now, try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.414
It looks complicated ,

09:42.499 --> 09:45.167
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.418
I sure hope so.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.462
At lunch , pick up a box of chocolates,

09:48.546 --> 09:50.381
a dozen carnations,
and some bath salts.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.423
I'll explain later.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.883
Thank you , Miss Holloway.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.469
You're really wonderful
for looking out for me this way.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.054
It's Joan .

09:57.138 --> 09:58.931
And listen,

09:59.015 --> 10:00.641
don't take this the wrong way,

10:00.725 --> 10:03.602
but a girl like you ,
with those darling little ankles,

10:03.687 --> 10:05.562
I'd find a way to make 'em sing .

10:07.232 --> 10:09.483
Also, men love scarves.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.151
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.738
Oh! And Mr. Sterling . How are you?

10:14.823 --> 10:15.823
Morning , girls.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.537
You look like a hundred bucks,
Long night?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.330
It's not this tobacco thing , is it?

10:23.415 --> 10:24.748
It's been on my mind .

10:24.833 --> 10:26.458
Yeah , well , I should hope so.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.501
Lee Garner, his father,

10:27.585 --> 10:29.586
the whole Lucky Strike family
will be here at 4.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.923
You worried?

10:33.008 --> 10:34.466
No.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.385
If I was worried ,
I'd ask you what you've got,

10:36.469 --> 10:39.305
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume
you've got something ,

10:39.389 --> 10:41.390
which means you should be worried .

10:41.474 --> 10:43.851
So you came here because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.520
No, I wanted to make sure
you were here.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.607
In body. Give me about a half hour
for the rest of it.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.652
How do I put this?

10:53.737 --> 10:56.363
Have we ever hired any Jews?

10:56.448 --> 10:57.698
Not on my watch.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.659
That's very funny. It's not what I meant.

11:00.744 --> 11:04.079
We've got an Italian .
Salvatore, my art director.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.373
- That won't work.
- Sorry.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.542
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.668
Yeah, I know.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.295
Selling Jewish products to Jewish people.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.546
That's very good .

11:12.630 --> 11:14.798
It's just that our 1 1 :00
is with Menken's Department Store

11:14.883 --> 11:18.177
and I wish we had someone
to make them feel. . .comfortable.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.846
You want me to run
down to the deli and grab somebody?

11:22.390 --> 11:23.599
You missed a button .

12:10.688 --> 12:13.732
Ah . Look at you , Gidget.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.401
Still trying to fill out that bikini?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.194
Summer's coming .

12:17.278 --> 12:19.488
Without the medical claims,

12:19.572 --> 12:24.618
all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.161
My neighbor posed for that.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.623
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed .

12:29.707 --> 12:31.083
Of course, he doesn't smoke.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.334
Had him hold a pencil .

12:32.419 --> 12:35.170
If I know these guys,
you're better off with a little sex appeal .

12:35.255 --> 12:37.172
Can you give me a woman
in a bathing suit,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.424
put her next to your guy?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.634
A sexy girl? I can do that.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.386
Give you a chance
to get a real model.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.638
Oh , I love my work.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.390
Speaking of sexy girls,

12:46.474 --> 12:48.267
are you going to Pete's bachelor party?

12:48.351 --> 12:49.977
I'm not really big on those things.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.604
Tell me about it. It's so embarrassing .

12:52.689 --> 12:54.189
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,

12:54.274 --> 12:56.316
I want to be alone so I can do something .

12:57.944 --> 13:00.654
Should we drink before
the meeting or after?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.198
Or both?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.785
So. . .that's it, huh? Relax?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.620
Don't be short with me.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.997
You're the writer.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.499
I thought it was worth a try.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.293
Greta Guttman is here to see you.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.294
Send her in .

13:15.378 --> 13:16.545
Oh, great.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.755
Now we get to hear from our man in research .

13:21.885 --> 13:24.219
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.680
you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected .

13:26.764 --> 13:29.475
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.351
I'm doing my own research .

13:31.436 --> 13:33.437
If you're planning to continue
with medical testimony,

13:33.521 --> 13:36.648
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.816
We must police ourselves.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.693
- There's your slogan .
- The medical thing is dead .

13:39.777 --> 13:40.694
We understand that.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.030
Yes, dead . An apt choice of words,

13:43.114 --> 13:46.325
considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.743
If we can't insist that they're not,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.621
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution .

13:50.705 --> 13:53.415
We can still suggest
that cigarettes are part of American life,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.125
or too good to give up,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.753
or, most appealing ,
an assertion of independence.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.172
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking .

14:00.256 --> 14:02.716
We can put a skull
and crossbones on the label .

14:02.800 --> 14:03.717
I love it.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.469
Before the war,

14:05.553 --> 14:07.346
when I studied with Adler in Vienna,

14:07.430 --> 14:09.723
we postulated that what Freud called
the death wish

14:09.807 --> 14:10.933
is as powerful a drive

14:11.017 --> 14:13.727
as those for sexual reproduction
and physical sustenance.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.729
Freud , you say?

14:15.813 --> 14:16.730
What agency is he with?

14:16.814 --> 14:20.692
So we're supposed to believe
that people are all living one way

14:20.777 --> 14:22.736
and secretly thinking
the exact opposite?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.488
That's ridiculous.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.615
Let me tell you something,
Miss Guttman--

14:26.699 --> 14:27.866
Doctor.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.868
Dr. Guttman .

14:29.953 --> 14:32.871
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

14:32.997 --> 14:37.834
but it so happens that people were
buying cigarettes before Freud was born .

14:37.919 --> 14:40.128
The issue here isn't
why should people smoke.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.298
It's why should people
smoke Lucky Strike.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.759
Suggesting that our customers have a--

14:45.843 --> 14:48.720
What did you call it? A death wish?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.681
I just don't see that on a billboard .

14:50.765 --> 14:53.517
So what if Reader's Digest
says they're dangerous

14:53.601 --> 14:55.769
They also said Bambi
was the book of the century.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.770
There's no proof.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.480
There's conclusive proof

14:58.565 --> 15:01.817
that none of these low-tar,
low-nicotine, or filtration systems

15:01.901 --> 15:04.361
have any effect on the incidences
of lung cancer.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.154
Just give me the damn report.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.532
I think you'll find it very convincing .

15:08.616 --> 15:09.783
I'm sure I will .

15:09.867 --> 15:11.076
You're the one who found

15:11.160 --> 15:13.161
all of our medical testimonials
in the first place.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.538
That's true, Mr. Draper, but I--

15:14.622 --> 15:16.039
Has anyone else seen this?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.416
Of course not. It's your account.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.875
Good .

15:20.587 --> 15:22.337
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.881
I'm sorry, I just find your whole
approach perverse.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.553
Good luck at the meeting.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.763
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.229
Sal , I'll take that drink now.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.895
Mr. Draper.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.857
Excuse me.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.025
Mr. Draper.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.612
I'm sorry to wake you ,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.407
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.408
No, sir.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.702
That's good .

16:35.787 --> 16:36.703
Who are you?

16:36.788 --> 16:39.081
I'm Peggy Olsen, the new girl .

16:43.753 --> 16:47.297
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

16:48.966 --> 16:52.219
I know it's my first day,
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,

16:52.303 --> 16:54.971
but do I have to?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.307
I see your point.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.976
I brought you some aspirin.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.982
Send him in .

17:07.944 --> 17:09.528
You look like a hundred bucks.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.488
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

17:11.572 --> 17:14.116
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning , Pete.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.701
I've never had any complaints.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.744
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.538
She's the new girl .

17:19.622 --> 17:21.456
You always get the new girl .

17:21.541 --> 17:23.250
Management gets all the perks.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.585
Where are you from , honey?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.921
Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.339
Top notch .

17:29.424 --> 17:30.716
But I meant where are you from?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.927
Are you Amish or something?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.930
No. I'm from Brooklyn .

17:37.014 --> 17:38.056
Well, you're in the city now.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.142
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.936
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman .

17:43.020 --> 17:44.771
Is that all , Mr. Draper?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.606
Hey, I'm not done here.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.816
I'm working my way up.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.276
That will be all.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.610
Peggy, right?

17:50.695 --> 17:51.945
Yes.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.698
Oh, and it's time for
your 1 1 :00 meeting.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.825
Oh, and sorry about Mr. Campbell here.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.827
He left his manners
back at the fraternity house.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.208
She's a little young for you, Draper.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.169
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman .

18:07.253 --> 18:08.295
When's the wedding again?

18:08.379 --> 18:11.047
Sunday. Did Ken tell you
about the bachelor party tonight?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.215
He sure did .

18:12.300 --> 18:13.842
So do I get first crack at her?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.386
Word is she took down more sailors
than The Arizona.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.971
How old are you , Pete?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.556
I just turned 26.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.976
I bet the whole world looks like
one great big brassiere strap

18:23.060 --> 18:24.102
just waiting to be snapped , huh?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.646
You are good with words, Draper.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.191
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.985
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
Advertising is a very small world ,

18:34.071 --> 18:36.573
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

18:36.657 --> 18:39.242
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

18:39.327 --> 18:40.952
you make it even smaller.

18:41.078 --> 18:45.540
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,
you'll never run this place.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.167
You'll die in that corner office,

18:47.251 --> 18:49.294
a mid-level executive
with a little bit of hair

18:49.378 --> 18:51.254
who women go home with out of pity.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.008
Want to know why?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.093
Because no one will like you .

19:03.935 --> 19:06.478
Oh ! Here are our miracle-workers now.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.979
You know Pete Campbell , of course,

19:08.064 --> 19:10.023
your account executive
if you choose to do business with us.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.025
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,

19:12.109 --> 19:13.109
the best creative director in New York.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.403
Well, at least the building ,
Pleasure to meet you .

19:16.739 --> 19:17.781
Oop. Sorry about that.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.991
I'm Rachel Menken .

19:20.076 --> 19:22.494
Oh . U h , sorry. I was expecting--

19:22.578 --> 19:24.663
You were expecting me to be a man .

19:24.747 --> 19:26.081
My father was, too.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.125
And you are?

19:30.878 --> 19:34.464
Why, Don , you remember David Cohen
from the art department.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.132
Of course! David .

19:36.217 --> 19:38.885
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.054
Well, why don't we make
ourselves comfortable?

19:41.138 --> 19:43.056
And , Miss Menken , you can tell us
what you have in mind .

19:43.140 --> 19:44.266
Wonderful .

19:46.310 --> 19:47.853
That's very subtle.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.020
Isn't that your shirt?

19:49.105 --> 19:52.065
Had to go all the way to the mailroom ,
but I found one.

20:13.713 --> 20:17.632
So you must be Peggy Olsen .

20:20.011 --> 20:21.177
Joan Holloway sent you over.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.971
She's a great girl . How is Joan?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.556
She sends her regards.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.099
She's a lot of fun .

20:26.183 --> 20:27.976
Must be a scream to work with her.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.186
Yes, it's pretty terrific.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.649
Try to make yourself comfortable.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.817
Relax.

20:43.534 --> 20:48.121
I see from your chart, and your finger,
that you're not married .

20:48.205 --> 20:49.915
That's right.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.792
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.295
Well, I was--

20:55.379 --> 20:57.130
No reason to be nervous.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.424
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you .

20:59.508 --> 21:01.176
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

21:01.260 --> 21:03.345
about the possibility of sexual activity.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.846
Spread your knees.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.557
That's good to hear.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.351
Although , as a doctor,

21:09.435 --> 21:11.811
I'd like to think that putting a woman
in this situation

21:11.896 --> 21:15.315
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.525
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.954
I'll warn you now,

21:29.038 --> 21:32.165
I will take you off this medicine if you abuse it.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.875
It's for your own good, really.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.713
But the fact is,
even in our modern times,

21:38.798 --> 21:42.550
easy women don't find husbands.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.721
I understand, Dr. Emerson .

21:46.806 --> 21:49.182
I really am a very responsible person .

21:49.266 --> 21:52.352
Well, I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl .

21:52.436 --> 21:54.187
Now, Joan--

21:54.271 --> 21:56.398
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed .

21:59.735 --> 22:03.196
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid .

22:03.280 --> 22:05.198
They're $ 1 1 a month,

22:05.282 --> 22:07.742
but don't think you have to go out
and become the town pump

22:07.827 --> 22:10.328
just to get your money's worth .

22:10.413 --> 22:11.621
Excuse my French.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.378
So what Don is saying
is that through a variety of media,

22:18.462 --> 22:20.213
including a spot during
The Danny Thomas show,

22:20.297 --> 22:22.966
if you can afford it,
we could really boost awareness.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.219
Then , a 1 0% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

22:26.303 --> 22:28.221
will increase your first-time visitors.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.181
Once we get them into the store,

22:30.266 --> 22:34.019
the rest. . . is kind of up to you .

22:34.103 --> 22:36.229
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old .

22:36.313 --> 22:38.356
We share a wall with Tiffany's.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.191
Honestly, a coupon?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.987
Miss Menken, coupons work.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.739
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.574
He might, but he's not here

22:47.658 --> 22:51.244
because we just
had our lowest sales year ever.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.539
So I suppose what I think
matters most right now.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.251
Miss Menken , why did you come here?

22:58.335 --> 23:03.214
There are a dozen other agencies
better suited to your. . .needs.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.761
If I wanted some man who happened
to be from the same. . .village as my father

23:07.845 --> 23:09.262
to manage my account,

23:09.346 --> 23:10.472
I could have stayed where I was.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.058
Their research favors coupons, too.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.394
It's not just research, Miss Menken.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.146
Housewives love coupons.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.773
I'm not interested in housewives.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.275
What kind of people do you want?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.319
I want your kind of people, Mr. Draper:

23:24.403 --> 23:26.112
people who don't care about coupons,

23:26.197 --> 23:27.280
whether or not they can afford it.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.866
People who are coming to the store
because it is expensive.

23:29.950 --> 23:33.036
We obviously have very different ideas.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.789
Yes, like the customer is always right?

23:37.374 --> 23:39.876
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.712
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.090
M iss, you are way out of line.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.132
Don , please.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.342
Let's not get emotional here.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.010
There's no reason
we can't talk this out.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.845
Talk out what? This silly idea

23:50.930 --> 23:53.264
that people are gonna come
to some store they've never been to

23:53.349 --> 23:54.474
because it's more expensive?

23:54.558 --> 23:55.975
It works for Chanel .

23:56.060 --> 23:57.352
Menken's is not Chanel .

23:57.436 --> 23:59.312
That's a vote of confidence.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.189
What Don's saying is,

24:01.273 --> 24:03.191
Chanel is a very different kind of place.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.319
It's French, it's continental, it's--

24:06.403 --> 24:08.321
Not just another
Jewish department store?

24:08.405 --> 24:09.489
Exactly.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.324
You were right, Roger.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.743
This place really runs on charm .

24:13.828 --> 24:15.495
- This is ridiculous.
- Don .

24:15.579 --> 24:17.747
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

24:17.832 --> 24:20.416
This meeting is over,
Good luck, Miss Menken.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.638
Hey, Don , I don't blame you .

24:33.722 --> 24:35.140
She was way out of line.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.976
Adding money and education
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.855
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you .

24:41.981 --> 24:45.108
I'm not gonna pretend I don't want your job,
but you were right.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.027
I'm not great with people, and you are.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.488
I mean, not counting
that meeting we were just in .

24:50.573 --> 24:53.908
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.077
There's plenty of room at the top.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.417
Look, I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.919
It's just this damn tobacco thing .

25:05.004 --> 25:07.172
You'll think of something .
A man like you

25:07.256 --> 25:09.382
I'd follow into combat blindfolded ,

25:09.466 --> 25:10.925
and I wouldn't be the first.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.468
Am I right, buddy?

25:14.180 --> 25:15.722
Let's take it a little slower.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.599
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.106
Fuck you .

25:27.484 --> 25:29.319
Dr. Emerson's a dream , isn't he?

25:29.403 --> 25:30.612
He seemed nice.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.405
He has a place in South Hampton .

25:32.489 --> 25:35.491
I'm not saying that I've seen it,
but it's beautiful .

25:36.660 --> 25:38.369
Now, don't be nervous,

25:38.454 --> 25:41.039
but this is the nerve center of the office.

25:41.123 --> 25:44.417
You and your boss rely on the willing
and cheerful cooperation

25:44.501 --> 25:46.461
of a few skilled employees.

25:46.545 --> 25:51.090
Never snap, yell,
or be sarcastic with them .

25:51.175 --> 25:54.385
And above all, always be a supplicant.

25:59.642 --> 26:02.477
I know you girls are busy,
but we've got a new one.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.230
Peggy, this is Marge, Nanette, and Ivy.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.274
I brought you some things.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.318
I guess a sort of
"getting to know you" gift.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.446
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.448
If I know Joan , the candy's for me.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.908
Joan , you're not fair.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.452
You know she has to lose 8 pounds
by the Christmas party.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.454
I think you look great.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.456
Yeah, it's because I'm sitting down .

26:23.540 --> 26:25.458
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.668
Who does she work for?

26:26.752 --> 26:28.169
Don Draper.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.462
They got rid of Eleanor?

26:29.546 --> 26:31.089
She moved on .

26:31.173 --> 26:33.091
Draper wasn't interested .

26:33.175 --> 26:34.801
Well , she couldn't get a call through .

26:34.885 --> 26:36.302
Rude little thing .

26:36.387 --> 26:37.887
We see that you've got your hands full .

26:37.972 --> 26:39.472
Don't want to be a bother.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.473
Nice meeting you .

26:40.557 --> 26:41.474
Hey, you have great legs.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.976
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them

26:43.060 --> 26:45.019
if he could see them .

26:45.104 --> 26:47.397
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

26:50.442 --> 26:54.487
I just don't know what we have to do
to make these government interlopers happy.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.949
They tell us to make a safer cigarette,
we do it,

26:58.033 --> 27:00.493
and then suddenly that's not good enough .

27:00.577 --> 27:02.328
Might as well be living in Russia.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.706
Damn straight.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.629
You know, this morning I got a call

27:11.714 --> 27:13.965
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson ,

27:14.049 --> 27:16.467
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

27:16.552 --> 27:18.219
because of the health claims they made.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.679
Yeah, we're aware of that, M r. Garner,

27:19.763 --> 27:21.097
but you have to realize

27:21.181 --> 27:23.057
that through the manipulation
of the mass media,

27:23.142 --> 27:24.517
the public is under the impression

27:24.601 --> 27:30.315
that your cigarettes are linked to. . ,
certain fatal diseases.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.025
Manipulation of the media?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.735
Hell , that's what I pay you for.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.779
Our product is fine,
I smoke 'em myself.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.824
My granddad smoked 'em .
He died at 95 years old .

27:39.908 --> 27:41.367
He was hit by a truck.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.703
I understand . But our hands are tied .

27:43.787 --> 27:46.539
We're no longer allowed to advertise
that Lucky Strikes are safe.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.207
So what the hell are we gonna do?

27:48.292 --> 27:50.752
We've already funded
our own tobacco research center

27:50.836 --> 27:52.670
to put this whole rumor to rest.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.547
And that's a very good start.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.175
But it may not affect sales.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.511
Don , I think maybe that's your cue.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.849
Well , uh . . .

28:04.933 --> 28:07.060
I have been , uh . . .

28:08.312 --> 28:10.563
thinking quite a bit about this,

28:10.647 --> 28:12.148
and , uh. . .

28:23.452 --> 28:28.122
I mean, you know I'm a Lucky Strike man
from way back, so. . .

28:35.672 --> 28:36.798
I might have a solution.

28:38.092 --> 28:42.261
At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering
the burgeoning field of research ,

28:42.388 --> 28:46.015
and our analysis shows that the health risks
associated with your product

28:46.100 --> 28:47.600
is not the end of the world .

28:47.684 --> 28:51.437
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

28:51.522 --> 28:53.648
and some of them die.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.192
Cars are dangerous.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.861
There's nothing you can do about it.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.696
You still have to get where you're going .

29:02.199 --> 29:04.575
Cigarettes are exactly the same,

29:04.660 --> 29:06.619
so why don't we simply say,

29:06.703 --> 29:08.913
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

29:08.997 --> 29:10.581
"You're a man .

29:10.666 --> 29:11.707
"The world is dangerous.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.293
"Smoke your cigarette.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.712
You still have to get where you're going ."

29:18.048 --> 29:20.800
That's very interesting .

29:20.884 --> 29:23.845
I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous,

29:23.929 --> 29:24.887
it would be interesting .

29:24.972 --> 29:26.639
Except they aren't.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.391
That's your slogan?

29:28.475 --> 29:30.977
"You're going to die anyway. Die with us"?

29:31.061 --> 29:34.355
Actually, it's a fairly well-established
psychological principle

29:34.440 --> 29:37.650
that society has a death wish ,

29:37.734 --> 29:40.194
and if we could just tap into that,

29:40.279 --> 29:41.654
the market potential is--

29:41.738 --> 29:43.364
What the hell are you talking about?

29:43.449 --> 29:44.657
Are you insane?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.117
I'm not selling rifles here.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.077
I'm in the tobacco business.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.662
We're selling America.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.665
The Indians gave it to us, for shit's sake.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.208
Come on , Dad .

29:54.293 --> 29:55.751
Let's get out of here.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.881
The bright spot is at least we know

29:59.965 --> 30:02.758
if we have this problem,
everybody has this problem .

30:15.772 --> 30:17.690
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.776
I don't know, Don . Can you?

30:23.780 --> 30:26.657
The Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest

30:26.742 --> 30:28.117
have done you a favor.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.911
They've let you know that
any ad that brings up

30:29.995 --> 30:33.873
the concept of cigarettes
and health together. . .

30:33.957 --> 30:36.959
Well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.754
Yes, and we're grateful to them .

30:39.838 --> 30:44.634
But what Lee, Jr. , said is right.

30:45.802 --> 30:49.680
If you can't make those health claims,
neither can your competitors.

30:49.806 --> 30:55.770
So we've got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.021
Not exactly.

30:57.105 --> 31:01.817
This is the greatest advertising opportunity
since the invention of cereal.

31:02.819 --> 31:07.156
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.284
We can say anything we want.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.370
How do you make your cigarettes?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.747
I don't know.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.916
Shame on you .

31:17.000 --> 31:19.794
We breed insect-repellent tobacco seeds,

31:19.878 --> 31:21.754
plant them in the North Carolina sunshine,

31:21.838 --> 31:25.091
grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it--

31:25.175 --> 31:27.843
There you go.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.937
But everybody else's tobacco is toasted .

31:38.021 --> 31:42.149
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.818
Lucky Strikes. . .

31:43.902 --> 31:45.444
is toasted .

31:47.531 --> 31:50.491
Well, gentlemen , I don't think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.036
I think you do.

31:55.664 --> 31:59.041
Advertising is based on one thing :

31:59.126 --> 32:00.960
happiness.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.337
And you know what happiness is?

32:03.422 --> 32:06.424
Happiness is the smell of a new car.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.802
It's freedom from fear.

32:09.886 --> 32:14.640
It's a billboard on the side of the road
that screams with reassurance

32:14.725 --> 32:18.769
that whatever you're doing . . .it's okay.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.816
You are okay.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.658
It's toasted .

32:35.912 --> 32:37.580
I get it.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.925
You had me worried .

32:50.010 --> 32:53.596
I don't know if you were drunk or not drunk,

32:53.680 --> 32:54.889
but that was inspired .

32:54.973 --> 32:57.808
For the record , I pulled it out of thin air,

32:57.893 --> 32:59.560
so thank you , up there.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.395
You're looking in the wrong direction.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.148
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

33:04.232 --> 33:07.610
what do you say you reconsider this
presidential campaign?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.945
I don't know. Bunting and babies?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.656
That's hard work.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.115
I'd only make hash of it.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.534
Modesty. That's adorable.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.245
Consider the product:
he's young , handsome, Navy hero.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.747
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

33:19.831 --> 33:21.666
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.959
Mr. Draper, you've got visitors.

33:25.379 --> 33:27.672
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.800
We heard you saved the day.

33:30.884 --> 33:34.470
Oh, thank you , boys. I appreciate it.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.888
I told them how amazing you were.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.556
I'm still tingling .

33:37.683 --> 33:40.226
Well, looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

33:40.310 --> 33:41.560
so I'll be on my way.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.895
Don , thanks again for the home run .

33:42.979 --> 33:44.897
- I love to come through .
- Speaking of which,

33:44.981 --> 33:47.191
any chance you could
patch things up with Rachel Menken?

33:47.275 --> 33:49.402
Any way you can be
as charming as I said you were?

33:49.486 --> 33:51.821
Haven't you had enough
of my magic for one day?

33:51.905 --> 33:54.281
She's worth $3 million .

33:54.366 --> 33:55.991
You're a whore.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.037
Peggy--

34:00.122 --> 34:02.081
Could she get us a little more ice?

34:02.165 --> 34:04.750
- Yes, Mr. Draper?
- Just a minute.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.919
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.171
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5: 1 5.

34:09.256 --> 34:10.673
The bachelor party's underway.

34:10.757 --> 34:11.924
I don't know.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.135
Oh, come on, Don . All hands on deck.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.928
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

34:16.012 --> 34:17.930
Maybe next time.

34:20.642 --> 34:21.600
Come on , guys.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.144
Don will join us later, right, Don?

34:31.820 --> 34:33.070
If Greta's research was any good ,

34:33.155 --> 34:34.363
I would have used it.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.533
What are you talking about?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.744
I'm saying I had a report just like that.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.371
And it's not like there's
some magic machine

34:42.456 --> 34:44.957
that makes identical copies of things.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.210
I still think she was right.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.801
Have a great night, Pete.

34:55.886 --> 34:56.886
Congratulations.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.148
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting .

35:09.232 --> 35:12.026
Fear stimulates my imagination .

35:14.070 --> 35:17.740
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

35:17.824 --> 35:20.451
and for, you know. . .

35:20.535 --> 35:23.788
standing up for me with Mr. Campbell.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.011
First of all , Peggy,

35:39.095 --> 35:41.472
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend .

35:43.850 --> 35:46.352
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again ,

35:46.436 --> 35:49.396
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station .

35:52.317 --> 35:55.027
He said he left his fountain pen in here.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.987
I didn't know.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.369
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.330
Of course not.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.833
Go home. Put your curlers in.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.960
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.839
Oh . And , Peggy,

36:14.923 --> 36:16.215
I need you to place a call .

36:38.154 --> 36:40.072
I want to see you here every 1 5 minutes,

36:40.156 --> 36:42.116
whether you have drinks or not.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.325
Uh , every five minutes.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.538
Let's live here.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.081
Better do more than look tonight.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.708
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?

36:50.792 --> 36:53.669
Come on . I'm Italian .

36:53.753 --> 36:55.629
Is there some kind of party here?

36:57.173 --> 36:58.924
How did you swing it?

36:59.009 --> 37:00.968
They work at the Automat.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.762
He pressed a button , and they came out.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.472
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.099
Definitely not.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.184
Well, I have the best seat.
What are we drinking?

37:09.269 --> 37:11.562
More of whatever's
making you the way you are.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.105
I love this place.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.108
It's hot, loud , and filled with men .

37:16.192 --> 37:18.027
I know what you mean .

37:30.206 --> 37:32.374
Oh , my God . I can already feel it.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.127
I have a feeling you're like this all the time.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.587
I like to laugh.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.130
Is that right?

37:38.214 --> 37:40.132
Now, you stop that.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.675
You said you like to laugh .

37:41.760 --> 37:43.385
I mean it.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.137
It's-- It's too. . .

37:45.221 --> 37:46.931
Too delicious.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.350
Hey, I said stop it,
What do you think you're doing?

37:49.434 --> 37:51.143
You know exactly.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.978
U m , you know what, girls?

37:53.063 --> 37:54.146
I think we should go.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.230
Oh , come on .

37:55.315 --> 37:57.191
You're hurting me.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.445
I'll be good .

38:03.114 --> 38:05.115
Buy the girls whatever they want.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.707
So, uh , what do you fellas do?

38:13.792 --> 38:16.335
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.337
Hell, the world .

38:43.279 --> 38:46.198
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

38:46.282 --> 38:48.033
and one whiskey neat.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.707
So. . .

38:54.791 --> 38:56.792
you're going to ply me with drinks

38:56.876 --> 38:59.294
and convince me what a terrible
mistake I'm making .

39:00.422 --> 39:02.089
That is quite a drink.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.259
You got in trouble, didn't you?

39:08.138 --> 39:09.388
I shouldn't have lost my temper,

39:09.472 --> 39:11.473
and I certainly
shouldn't have treated you

39:11.558 --> 39:12.850
like anything less than a client.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.893
Apology accepted .

39:16.521 --> 39:18.522
So you understand .

39:18.606 --> 39:20.399
Now I do.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.361
It was, uh, refreshing, really.

39:24.446 --> 39:29.033
I mean , actually hearing all the things
I always assumed people were thinking .

39:31.327 --> 39:33.328
Well, I'm not really as bad as all that.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.790
I was under a lot of pressure.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.293
Another account.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.630
Doesn't really matter.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.841
No, it doesn't.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.640
So, without making things worse,
can I ask you a personal question?

39:53.725 --> 39:57.269
Don't you want to get
a second drink in me first?

39:57.353 --> 39:58.562
Why aren't you married?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.399
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

40:02.484 --> 40:04.735
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman .

40:04.819 --> 40:07.029
Don't you think that getting married
and having a family

40:07.113 --> 40:08.655
would make you happier
than all the headaches

40:08.740 --> 40:10.282
that go along with . . .

40:10.366 --> 40:11.867
fighting people like me?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.830
If I weren't a woman,
I would be allowed

40:16.915 --> 40:19.458
to ask you the same question .

40:19.542 --> 40:21.043
And if I weren't a woman,

40:21.127 --> 40:24.546
I wouldn't have to choose
between putting on an apron

40:24.672 --> 40:28.717
and the thrill of making my father's store
what I always thought it should be.

40:28.802 --> 40:34.973
So that's it. You won't get married
because you find business to be a thrill .

40:35.058 --> 40:37.392
That and . . .

40:40.396 --> 40:42.481
I've never been in love.

40:42.565 --> 40:46.193
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.904
I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.

40:48.988 --> 40:53.158
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan .

40:53.243 --> 40:54.368
Oh , you mean love.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.161
You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

40:56.246 --> 40:58.330
where you can't eat and you can't work

40:58.414 --> 41:04.545
and you just run off
and get married and make babies.

41:04.629 --> 41:08.590
The reason you haven't felt it
is because it doesn't exist.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.050
What you call love

41:10.135 --> 41:14.179
was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.349
Is that right?

41:17.433 --> 41:19.059
I'm pretty sure about it.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.354
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

41:22.438 --> 41:24.648
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

41:24.732 --> 41:26.066
to make you forget those facts,

41:26.151 --> 41:27.609
but I never forget.

41:29.529 --> 41:32.364
I'm living like there's no tomorrow. . .

41:32.448 --> 41:34.533
because there isn't one.

41:36.536 --> 41:39.496
I don't think I realized it until this moment,

41:41.166 --> 41:45.544
but it must be hard being a man , too.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.130
Excuse me?

41:49.883 --> 41:50.841
Mr. Draper--

41:50.925 --> 41:52.384
- Don .
- Mr. Draper,

41:52.468 --> 41:55.679
I don't know what it is
you really believe in ,

41:55.763 --> 42:02.811
but I do know what it feels like
to be out of place, to be disconnected ,

42:02.896 --> 42:05.564
to see the whole world
laid out in front of you

42:05.648 --> 42:08.150
the way other people live it.

42:08.234 --> 42:13.447
There is something about you
that tells me you know it, too.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.829
I don't know if that's true.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.292
You want another drink?

42:25.376 --> 42:27.419
No.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.881
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.681
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again .

42:39.807 --> 42:45.020
I'll be back in the office Monday morning,
for a real meeting .

42:45.104 --> 42:47.105
I'd like that.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.456
We're not buying anything.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.792
Actually, for the first time today,

43:06.876 --> 43:09.086
I'm not selling anything .

43:09.170 --> 43:11.421
Does Peggy live here?

43:11.506 --> 43:12.547
Hold on.

43:24.894 --> 43:26.353
Do you know him?

43:28.564 --> 43:30.107
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

43:31.776 --> 43:32.818
He's really drunk.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.028
It's okay, Marjorie.

43:37.573 --> 43:41.535
So. . .what are you doing?

43:41.619 --> 43:42.744
Nothing .

43:42.829 --> 43:46.206
Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.250
I'm getting married on Sunday.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.419
I heard that.

43:52.672 --> 43:54.840
You must think I'm a creep.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.594
Why are you here?

44:08.938 --> 44:11.606
I wanted to see you tonight.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.529
Me?

44:17.613 --> 44:19.865
I had to see you .

44:29.542 --> 44:30.792
Marjorie?

44:30.877 --> 44:33.003
Yeah, Peg?

44:33.087 --> 44:35.088
I'm going to bed now.

46:00.800 --> 46:04.719
I called the office. They said you'd left.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.641
I didn't want to bother you .

46:09.725 --> 46:11.518
It's no bother.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.771
I just assumed you were staying
in the city again.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.443
There's a plate in the oven .

46:25.575 --> 46:27.534
Unless you're not hungry.

46:27.618 --> 46:28.785
I'm not.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.833
I'll be right back.

46:35.918 --> 46:37.169
Don't move.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.873
