What's up, dog?

02:01.118 --> 02:02.283
What up?

02:02.285 --> 02:03.317
You bring the money?

02:03.319 --> 02:05.419
Hell yeah.

02:05.421 --> 02:10.789
I got three bucks.

02:10.792 --> 02:11.824
We have five bucks.

02:11.826 --> 02:13.192
That's not enough for
a six-pack.

02:13.194 --> 02:14.744
Six pack?

02:14.745 --> 02:16.295
Damn, Beetle, you so fancy.
You want to drink it

02:16.297 --> 02:17.629
from a glass slipper,
too? Or, how about

02:17.631 --> 02:19.464
I serve it to you on a nice,
velvet pillow?

02:19.466 --> 02:20.782
Shut up, Joker.

02:20.783 --> 02:22.099
I don't like that nasty-ass
malt liquor you drink.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.835
Dude, two 40s we'll be cool.
It's enough, too, man, I

02:24.837 --> 02:26.069
thought you wanted to catch a
buzz.

02:26.071 --> 02:28.071
All right, whatever.
Whatever, whatever.

02:28.073 --> 02:29.639
Go ask that guy right there.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.206
Man quit being a wussy
and go ask him shy boy.

02:31.209 --> 02:32.741
I'm not gonna
ask him, you ask him.

02:32.743 --> 02:34.076
Come on, he's leaving.

02:34.077 --> 02:35.410
Well go talk to him then, quick.

02:35.412 --> 02:36.377
Never mind, it's too late.

02:36.379 --> 02:40.113
I'll ask the next
person that comes by.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.181
Hey, Sharky.

02:50.123 --> 02:51.188
What's up, Sharky?

02:51.190 --> 02:52.689
What's up, suckers?

02:52.691 --> 02:54.357
How much we got, fools?

02:54.359 --> 02:55.925
This.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.492
Joker says he's gonna ask
the next person that comes by.

02:57.495 --> 03:00.295
And that's you, Sharky.
You right on point, dog.

03:00.297 --> 03:02.797
Sheesh. Leave
it to the master, fools.

03:02.799 --> 03:06.299
Look at that...
You fools just watch.

03:06.301 --> 03:07.099
Cup check.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.433
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoooooo!

03:08.435 --> 03:10.568
I'll ask anything
from anyone, any time.

03:10.570 --> 03:12.570
That's how I get what I want.
Not like you fools

03:12.572 --> 03:15.573
standing there holding your
nuts.

03:15.575 --> 03:17.575
Oh, shit. It's Coach.

03:17.577 --> 03:19.209
Go ask him, Sharky.

03:19.211 --> 03:21.311
It's summer vacation,
he's got no authority over us now.

03:21.313 --> 03:24.414
Nah man, but camp
starts in a few days.

03:24.416 --> 03:26.849
Nah, just be cool, be cool.

03:26.851 --> 03:29.585
Rodriguez. Hope you
take care of that arm.

03:29.587 --> 03:30.652
You're gonna need it this
season.

03:30.654 --> 03:32.353
You know it, Coach. I feel good.

03:32.355 --> 03:36.256
Good, good, son.
What are you guys up to?

03:36.258 --> 03:38.491
Just hanging out, Coach.

03:38.493 --> 03:39.592
Just hanging out?

03:39.594 --> 03:40.559
Yup, hanging out.

03:40.561 --> 03:41.826
Yeah, just chillin.

03:41.828 --> 03:45.747
Chillin, huh?

03:45.748 --> 03:49.667
Chilly-chill. Chilled out.
Just chillin' like a cold beer...

03:49.669 --> 03:52.436
which I don't drink.
We don't drink beer...

03:52.438 --> 03:55.272
Come on, guys. I know
what you guys are up to.

03:55.274 --> 03:58.241
I was your age once.
You want someone to

03:58.243 --> 04:00.176
score you some beer that has ID?

04:00.178 --> 04:04.580
What? Oh, beer? Nooo!
No Coach, we're under age!

04:04.582 --> 04:08.583
Give me the money. Give
me the money, I'll get the beer.

04:08.585 --> 04:09.917
You serious?

04:09.919 --> 04:11.685
You want the beer or not?

04:11.687 --> 04:13.820
What, do you think I'm running
an undercover sting operation?

04:13.822 --> 04:19.724
NERVOUS LAUGHTER

04:19.726 --> 04:22.560
Just give me the money.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.162
All right, here you go.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.164
So you guys want,
a 12-pack or something?

04:27.166 --> 04:28.565
Yeah, yeah.

04:28.567 --> 04:32.701
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
a 12-pack would be cool.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.469
Did that just happen?

04:34.471 --> 04:35.570
Can you believe that, ay?

04:35.572 --> 04:37.371
The man is buying us some beer.

04:37.373 --> 04:39.073
Oh, yeah.

04:39.074 --> 04:40.774
This is gonna
be the best summer ever.

04:40.776 --> 04:43.777
Oh, shit.

04:43.779 --> 04:47.847
Cool, just be cool man.
Just be cool.

04:47.849 --> 04:49.782
We're just, we're waiting for
our ride, all right...

04:49.784 --> 04:51.216
we're just waiting for our ride.

04:51.218 --> 04:51.950
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:51.952 --> 04:58.356
Don't look at him.

04:58.358 --> 05:03.694
He's looking right at us.

05:03.696 --> 05:04.861
I'm texting.

05:04.863 --> 05:05.728
Don't look at him.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.230
Don't look suspicious.

05:07.231 --> 05:08.731
Texting's not suspicious.

05:08.733 --> 05:09.798
He's looking right at us.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.367
JOKER;
Bro, don't move. Stop moving.

05:12.369 --> 05:17.204
Oh my God he's got a big gun.
That's a big gun.

05:17.206 --> 05:21.307
Woah!

05:21.309 --> 05:22.808
Oh man! You got scared!

05:22.810 --> 05:24.043
No! You got scared!
Bro, I was looking -

05:24.044 --> 05:25.277
Yo, both of you got scared.

05:25.279 --> 05:26.511
I was just stretching, man.

05:26.513 --> 05:28.229
Man, I went like this.
I went like this.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.946
Sir... Man I was pitching!
I was just stretching my arm out.

05:29.949 --> 05:31.882
You know? Whoosh!

05:31.884 --> 05:34.217
Whatever, you were sketch.

05:34.219 --> 05:35.851
Scared, dude!

05:35.853 --> 05:37.219
Hey, here comes your

05:37.221 --> 05:38.787
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.

Here comes, here comes.

05:40.457 --> 05:43.324
One for me, and this
one's for you gentlemen.

05:43.326 --> 05:45.326
Got you my favorite brand.

05:45.328 --> 05:48.495
All right thanks Coach!
Good looking out!

05:48.497 --> 05:50.763
Sharky, this
is non-alcoholic beer.

05:50.765 --> 05:54.866
What? For real? Oh,
hell, no, that's not cool.

05:54.868 --> 05:56.701
Man, this is
the last of our money.

05:56.703 --> 05:58.703
I thought he was being cool.
He's culero. Forget what I said.

05:58.705 --> 05:59.970
Coach we hate your guts!
We think you suck!

05:59.972 --> 06:01.838
Yeah, yeah.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.640
Hey, Coach, whassup?
Why you gotta do us like that?

06:04.642 --> 06:07.876
Rodriguez, I'm doing you a favor.
You're a good athlete.

06:07.878 --> 06:10.879
But you're smarter than that.
You could be somebody.

06:10.881 --> 06:13.882
Hang out with these 2 clowns,
trying to score beer,

06:13.884 --> 06:15.617
you're not gonna get anywhere.

06:15.618 --> 06:17.351
Yo, first of all coach,
those 2 clowns over there -

06:17.354 --> 06:19.787
those are my homies, right?
And I'll tell you right now

06:19.789 --> 06:22.422
I am somebody and I don't need
your pinche validation or your

06:22.424 --> 06:25.825
stupid-ass non-alcoholic beer.

06:25.827 --> 06:27.359
Don't you understand
it, just control yourself!

06:27.361 --> 06:29.260
Man, get off me! Psssh!

06:29.262 --> 06:31.262
That's it. You're
cut from the team.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.397
Yo, have fun
with that magazine, huh?

06:33.399 --> 06:36.299
Don't even worry
about coming to camp, son.

06:36.301 --> 06:37.300
Freeze!

06:37.302 --> 06:41.737
SHRIEKING

06:41.739 --> 06:43.705
You once had a
wet dream about Mr. T.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.939
And that's true and you know it.

06:44.941 --> 06:46.824
Bullshit.

06:46.825 --> 06:48.708
Remember that time we went
on a class field trip to Yosemite?

06:48.711 --> 06:50.377
When we were, like, 12?

06:50.378 --> 06:52.044
That's right. Remember,
you woke up screaming one night,

06:52.047 --> 06:54.347
saying Mr. T. was gonna get you
from behind cabron.

06:54.349 --> 06:56.349
I remember. No,
no, that was a nightmare.

06:56.351 --> 06:58.017
I had a dream that I stole
Mr. T's van and he was

06:58.019 --> 06:59.518
gonna put the hurt on me.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.720
But anyway, moron, that's
not what a wet dream means.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.174
Whatever you say
puto I guess Mr. T.

07:03.200 --> 07:03.722
Was just putting

07:03.724 --> 07:05.224
a hurting on you.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.725
My god, can you
both of you just shut up?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.561
Look, I just got
kicked off the team.

07:09.563 --> 07:13.031
I lost my bat, my glove. You ask
me, both of y'all are gay.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.832
I've never seen either
one of you with a girl.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.433
Either that or
you're both virgins.

07:16.435 --> 07:17.434
Shit no, I ain't no virgin!

07:17.436 --> 07:20.037
I got laid last
summer in church camp.

07:20.038 --> 07:22.639
Humping your Mayor McCheese
pillow doesn't count, Joker.

07:22.641 --> 07:24.440
Look, fool, there's Felicia.

07:26.777 --> 07:29.844
All right, cool, Beetle,
she ain't gonna bite you.

07:29.846 --> 07:33.314
She ain't no Mr. T, but you got
to give girls a try sometime.

07:33.316 --> 07:34.515
Is that Beetle?

07:35.618 --> 07:38.919
Yeah. Hey, Beetle. What's up?

07:38.921 --> 07:44.457
She sees you. She's
waving, wave back, fool.

07:44.459 --> 07:48.093
Hi, Felicia.

07:48.095 --> 07:49.394
MUSIC OUT

07:49.396 --> 07:51.896
Oh my god.

07:51.898 --> 07:54.531
Are you all right, Beetle?

07:54.533 --> 07:55.498
What's up, man?

07:55.500 --> 07:59.868
I'll survive.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.636
Direct hit.

08:01.638 --> 08:02.737
We're gonna be over there.

08:02.739 --> 08:04.605
Oh, my god, are you okay?

08:04.607 --> 08:08.041
Yeah. Ow.

08:08.043 --> 08:11.411
You have... let me see.

08:11.413 --> 08:13.546
What happened?

08:13.548 --> 08:15.915
I got a boo-boo.

08:15.917 --> 08:19.585
Damn, Beetle.
You got really banged up.

08:19.587 --> 08:22.354
I'm okay, it only hurts
when I move any part of my body.

08:22.356 --> 08:24.689
I'm serious. Beetle.
I'm worried about you.

08:24.691 --> 08:27.091
Why would you
be worried about me?

08:27.093 --> 08:29.960
Beetle, I've known
you since like first grade.

08:29.962 --> 08:33.029
And you're always
so nice and so smart.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.563
And you probably
don't know this,

08:34.565 --> 08:37.432
but I used to copy your answers
in Mr. Gamba's class.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.732
I knew it.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.217
Hahahaha.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.702
Having you lean over my
left shoulder was the best thing

08:41.703 --> 08:43.570
that ever happened to me in
the 5th grade.

08:43.572 --> 08:46.406
Oh, ow.

08:46.408 --> 08:47.940
Careful. Where does it hurt?

08:47.942 --> 08:48.507
Oh, not there, a little lower.

08:48.509 --> 08:49.941
Here?

08:49.943 --> 08:51.142
Not there, a
little to the right.

08:51.144 --> 08:52.076
Here?

08:52.078 --> 08:55.446
No, just a little bit lower.

08:55.448 --> 08:56.530
Ow.

08:56.531 --> 08:57.613
Beetle, you're such a dog.

08:57.616 --> 09:01.551
I'm just playing.
Help me up. Ow.

09:01.553 --> 09:04.587
So what are you and your friends
doing for the rest of the day?

09:04.589 --> 09:06.889

09:18.834 --> 09:20.800
Yeah, of course I can.

09:20.802 --> 09:24.537
Ok, well, we took a
collection, so get some drinks and then

09:24.539 --> 09:26.672

That'll shrivel your liver.
Shrink your dick.

10:15.644 --> 10:17.910
Make you do things

10:17.912 --> 10:19.077
One minute you're

10:19.079 --> 10:21.646
and the next you're making
out with vatos in a van.

10:21.648 --> 10:24.015
And no one knows how
that shit got started.

10:24.017 --> 10:25.716
No one.

10:25.718 --> 10:31.021
So that's... give me this!
Give me my flyers back.

10:31.023 --> 10:34.491
MUSIC UP

10:34.493 --> 10:38.828
Oh, damn. Guys, I
think I forgot something,

10:38.830 --> 10:41.697
I got to go do some shopping.

10:41.699 --> 10:44.166
Yeah, shopping. Come
on, Beetle, let's go shopping.

10:44.168 --> 10:46.835
Ok.

10:56.912 --> 11:00.979
MUSIC OUT

11:01.848 --> 11:04.548
Damn, she's hot.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.016
I don't know, she
might be out of our league.

11:06.018 --> 11:07.584
Oh, hell, no, not for Sharky.

11:07.586 --> 11:08.918
Sharky's a man, he gets

11:08.920 --> 11:12.688
more poontang than
Ellen De Generous.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.290
All right, I'm going in.

11:27.203 --> 11:30.938
If you're making a
salad, may I make a suggestion?

11:30.940 --> 11:35.108
A suggestion?
Sure, babe, what is it?

11:35.110 --> 11:36.943
You should try
the fresh zucchini,

11:36.945 --> 11:39.812
rather than the cucumber.
It's an aphrodisiac.

11:39.814 --> 11:44.683
Oh really? You
know, I really love zucchini.

11:44.685 --> 11:45.917
Oh, now do you?

11:45.919 --> 11:48.019
Do you know
what I like to do with a big,

11:48.021 --> 11:51.155
fat, juicy zucchini
just like this one?

11:51.157 --> 11:52.840
Oh... What's that?

11:52.841 --> 11:54.524
I like to take it in my hands.

11:54.527 --> 11:56.811
Oh, that's nice.

11:56.812 --> 11:59.096
And then I
take a big, nice, knife.

11:59.098 --> 11:59.996
What, a knife?

11:59.998 --> 12:01.130
Oh, yeah.

12:01.132 --> 12:03.232
Oh, whatcha
gonna do with the knife?

12:03.234 --> 12:04.700
I'm gonna slice it up,

12:04.702 --> 12:06.601
sautee it in butter, I
never thought about using a

12:06.603 --> 12:08.669
zucchini in a salad before.

12:10.121 --> 12:11.570
Hold on. If
I didn't know any better,

12:11.573 --> 12:13.940
I'd think you were
coming on to me.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.208
What? Me? Come on to you? No.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.776
Oh, excuse me.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.645
No, no. I'm just, no,
I'm saying, I was just gonna

12:20.647 --> 12:23.047
ask a favor of you. Um.

12:23.049 --> 12:25.115
Me and my friends were
trying to score some booze,

12:25.117 --> 12:27.283
and I lost my ID.

12:27.285 --> 12:28.884
You lost your ID?

12:28.886 --> 12:30.619
Yeah. That's it.

12:30.621 --> 12:31.920
How old are you, kid?

12:31.922 --> 12:33.888
Oh, I'm of age. I promise you.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.689
I mean, normally I wouldn't
even make a big deal about

12:35.691 --> 12:36.790
something like this.

12:36.791 --> 12:37.890
My friend, Beetle's
shipping off to Iraq

12:37.893 --> 12:40.026
tomorrow, and you
know, it's just uh.

12:40.028 --> 12:42.061
It's crazy.

12:42.063 --> 12:44.863
Oh, dear. He is?
Where are your friends now?

12:44.865 --> 12:47.699
Beetle. Joker.
They're over there.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.667
Yeah, yeah, the big one's

13:00.676 --> 13:02.175
Hey, not so fast, mister.

13:02.177 --> 13:03.843
If I agree to get
your booze for you,

13:03.845 --> 13:07.246
you have to carry my
groceries home for me. Deal?

13:07.248 --> 13:08.981
Yeah. Deal.

13:08.983 --> 13:12.117
Ok. And I'll take
the zucchini, uh, suggestion.

13:12.119 --> 13:14.886
I'm telling you,
you won't regret it.

13:16.122 --> 13:20.791
Oh. Yes, yes, yes.

13:37.209 --> 13:39.709

17:10.912 --> 17:12.144
You'd better wear this.

17:12.146 --> 17:13.345
I don't think so.

17:13.347 --> 17:16.280
Sharky's a freeballer.
What a daredevil.

17:18.284 --> 17:21.117
I thought you and
your friends wanted to have fun?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.420
I guess I'll just have
to put my clothes back on.

17:23.422 --> 17:24.854
Sharky, just put on the condom.

17:24.856 --> 17:28.457
No, no, no wait.
Here, let me put it on.

17:28.459 --> 17:29.558

He's gonna kill us.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.229
Who's gonna kill you?

18:52.230 --> 18:54.397
Don't listen to them. These
guys are way out of line, Felicia.

18:54.399 --> 18:58.467
It was the Mafiosos. They
tried to jack us but we got away.

18:58.469 --> 19:00.902
Is that what those shots were?

19:00.904 --> 19:03.337
Oh my god Beetle, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

19:03.339 --> 19:05.639
Yeah, but I
could use some pants.

19:05.641 --> 19:08.575
I'll get you my dad's pants.
All right.

19:08.577 --> 19:10.143
Nice bunny suit.

Damn, the sidewalk's hot.

19:45.639 --> 19:49.040
Damn, the foil
is roasting my nuts.

19:49.409 --> 19:51.308
You guys realize that
once the story gets out,

19:51.310 --> 19:53.143
I don't have to worry
about my senior year,

19:53.145 --> 19:55.078
'cos I won't be getting
laid 'til I'm a senior citizen.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.015
You're just being dramatic.
Hey, where you going?

20:02.320 --> 20:03.953
That's a good idea, Beetle.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.587
I don't want to be a fricking
virgin for the rest of my life.

20:05.589 --> 20:09.157
Look, relax, Beetle.
I got an idea.

20:09.159 --> 20:10.958
All right, let's just get
off the street before anybody

20:10.960 --> 20:15.695
else sees us. Catch you guys
later, all right?

20:16.097 --> 20:19.164
Damn homie, you need
an extra-large, homes.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.173
Mrs. Ortiz? I'm

Is this your son?

20:33.345 --> 20:34.577
COP Oh.

20:34.579 --> 20:39.414
Ma'am. I need you
to understand me.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.783
I'm looking for your son.

20:43.286 --> 20:47.087
Your son is in big trouble.
He's a sexual predator.

20:47.089 --> 20:48.372
Sexo?

20:48.373 --> 20:49.656
Yes. Sexo, sexo.

20:49.658 --> 20:51.457
I caught him and his buddies
trying to screw my wife.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.293
He's a pervert.
Perverso, perverso.

20:58.999 --> 21:04.302
COP No. No badge number. I'm
not looking for any trouble.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.038
Just let your son know
that I'm looking for him.

21:10.710 --> 21:14.545
Suck a key to you too, lady.

21:49.348 --> 21:50.647
Benjamin?

21:51.383 --> 21:52.682
Yes, Mommy.

22:02.259 --> 22:06.227
I was working out.

22:06.229 --> 22:07.394
No, Mom, stop.

22:07.396 --> 22:10.530
Told you, I was out working out.
I'm trying out for wrestling

22:10.532 --> 22:12.298
next year, and I got to
make the weight.

22:18.271 --> 22:19.470
The cops came here?

22:20.473 --> 22:23.407
No, Mom, no problems.
Why did they come?

22:26.512 --> 22:31.180
Huh. Mom, why
are you wearing that?

22:32.816 --> 22:34.649
How many times have I told
you, if you can't read English,

22:34.651 --> 22:36.317
don't wear these shirts.

22:42.758 --> 22:44.591
That's probably what
the cop was talking about, Mom.

22:44.593 --> 22:46.359
Oh.

22:58.372 --> 23:00.105
Dang, I cant
play in these boots.

23:00.107 --> 23:02.407
That's H-O-R for you, son.

23:02.409 --> 23:03.508
Always knew
you were a big whore.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.809
Screw you, buddy boy.

23:04.811 --> 23:06.510
You ruined Easter
for me forever.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.211
Hey, that cop
really go to your pad?

23:08.213 --> 23:11.214
Yeah. I guess he found
my ID in my pants or something.

23:11.216 --> 23:13.016
Just a matter of time
before he busts me.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.817
Busts you for what
that his wife's a nympho.

23:18.789 --> 23:22.723
Worst thing he'll probably
do is whoop your ass.

23:22.725 --> 23:24.524
Thanks, man.

23:25.226 --> 23:26.792
The worst thing is that
those are my best pants.

23:26.794 --> 23:28.360
I know, and my shoes?

23:28.362 --> 23:29.694
Look at these raggedy-ass kicks.

23:29.696 --> 23:31.462
How'm I suppose to
find girls wearing these?

23:31.464 --> 23:32.663
Yo, relax.

23:32.665 --> 23:34.398
Didn't I tell you
guys I got a plan?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.600
Your last plan
almost got us shot.

23:36.602 --> 23:38.201
You know what, never mind, then.

23:38.203 --> 23:40.169
You guys are too immature
for this, anyway.

23:40.171 --> 23:43.105
What are you talking about,
I could grow a mustache in 3 days.

23:43.107 --> 23:44.339
He gets it from his mother.

23:44.341 --> 23:45.607
Whatever, dude.

23:45.608 --> 23:46.874
You're just mad 'cos
you're hung like a toddler.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.775
Shut up, puto, it's your shot.

23:48.777 --> 23:51.677
Hey, and don't blame your
Banda boots this time.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.178
Ha-ha.

23:53.180 --> 23:55.379
Damn!

23:58.150 --> 24:03.152
Look if we pull this off,
we're guaranteed to get laid, 100%.

24:03.154 --> 24:05.254
One hundred
percent - even Joker.

24:05.256 --> 24:06.388
Even Joker.

24:06.390 --> 24:07.122
Even me?

24:07.124 --> 24:08.624
Hell, yeah.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.125
Man, I hope you're
not talking about a hooker.

24:10.127 --> 24:13.561
No, I'm not talking
about some common streetwalkers.

24:13.563 --> 24:16.764
I'm talking about classy ladies
who know how to treat a man.

24:16.766 --> 24:18.799
And where are we
supposed to find them?

24:18.801 --> 24:21.835
You ever heard of a
place called Lola's Love Shack?

24:21.837 --> 24:23.369
Man, that place ain't real.

24:23.371 --> 24:25.371
Yeah, I heard they closed
that place down years ago.

24:25.373 --> 24:28.407
Not true, my brothers, not true.
The place went underground, but

24:28.409 --> 24:31.443
it's still around. We just got to
figure out where they moved to.

24:31.445 --> 24:33.344
And how we supposed to do that?

24:33.346 --> 24:37.614
You know you guys
sound like a bunch of pussies right now?

24:37.616 --> 24:39.849
Look, I'm telling you the place
is real, and it's

24:39.851 --> 24:41.817
just waiting for us.

24:41.819 --> 24:46.153
We just need some fake ID's and
we will be treated like kings.

24:46.155 --> 24:47.855
Like kings?

24:47.856 --> 24:49.556
Well, in your case,
like a dirty little princess.

24:49.558 --> 24:51.658
Oh, you got me on
that one, Cotton Tail.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.593
Well, how'd you
find out about this place?

24:53.595 --> 24:55.461
You know, my brother
used to tell me about it.

24:55.463 --> 24:57.262
Before he got sent
up to the Pinta.

24:57.264 --> 24:58.730
You know, but all the old
men in the neighborhood here?

24:58.732 --> 25:00.832
They know about it, but
they keep it hush-hush,

25:00.834 --> 25:03.334
'cos they know it's
some sweet shit.

25:03.336 --> 25:06.236
Look, I'm telling you virgins,
you want to become men?

25:06.238 --> 25:09.672
This is the best way. But if you
want to keep playing pocket pool

25:09.674 --> 25:12.907
and dreaming about Felicia, then
go right ahead.

25:15.478 --> 25:17.544
Ha-ha-ha.

25:20.215 --> 25:23.883
All right. I'm down with it.

25:24.352 --> 25:30.822
I'm in, too. Ok, guys,
this right here is for the ladies.

25:31.758 --> 25:35.359
HORSE!

25:39.698 --> 25:41.978
Oh, wait wait wait, Mafiosos.

25:42.004 --> 25:43.433
Mafiosos. Here comes Trouble.

25:43.435 --> 25:50.940
Oh man, yo guys, just be cool,
all right I'm gonna handle this.

25:50.942 --> 25:52.274
Hey, whassup, Trouble?

25:52.276 --> 25:54.943
What's going on, little vatos.

25:54.945 --> 25:55.643
Whatchu looking at?

25:55.645 --> 25:57.544
Nothing.

25:58.613 --> 25:59.545
Let me talk to you
over here, little homie.

25:59.547 --> 26:02.447
All right.

26:02.449 --> 26:04.215
I like your tattoo, man.

26:04.217 --> 26:07.751
Man shut up, ain't
nobody talking to you. Shut up.

26:10.989 --> 26:12.655
Yo, whassup, Trouble?

26:12.657 --> 26:14.356
Why you hang around
with these fools anyway?

26:14.358 --> 26:16.558
Oh, man, those
guys are like my brothers.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.726
Your brothers? Look,
your brother was one of us,

26:18.728 --> 26:22.596
all right, your real brother.
I heard you got jumped today.

26:22.598 --> 26:24.664
What? No, man,
I didn't get jumped.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.466
Oh, really? I heard
you got your ass handed to you,

26:27.468 --> 26:30.435
and don't be insulting my
intelligence, all right?

26:30.437 --> 26:33.337
Who got your back? We do.
And if you ever need anything,

26:33.339 --> 26:36.273
you give me a call, all right?
We got you.

26:36.275 --> 26:38.608
Oh man that's cool. You
know but everything's handled man.

26:38.610 --> 26:40.927
I'm straight.

26:40.928 --> 26:43.245
Oh, really? Is that why you
got caught in your chonies today?

26:43.247 --> 26:44.746
You know, it's real dangerous
out there, homie.

26:44.748 --> 26:47.281
You better think about it.

26:47.283 --> 26:49.416
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, you're right.

26:49.418 --> 26:52.719
I am right. You take
care of yourself, all right?

26:52.721 --> 26:54.487
Cool.

26:54.489 --> 26:57.556
Stay away from them clowns, man.
They ain't no good.

26:57.558 --> 26:59.457
Yeah, aight.

26:59.459 --> 27:00.791
They're no good.

27:00.793 --> 27:03.527
Hey, homies,
let's roll out of here.

27:12.036 --> 27:13.668
What'd they want?

27:13.670 --> 27:15.653
Oh, nothing, man.

27:15.654 --> 27:17.637
They just... they just think
'cos my brother got jumped

27:17.640 --> 27:19.439
into their gang, that I
will, too.

27:19.441 --> 27:21.641
We got your back, bro.

27:21.643 --> 27:23.909
Yeah, ok. All right, look.

27:23.911 --> 27:25.911
So tomorrow, we get our
fake IDs if we're gonna

27:25.913 --> 27:27.445
accomplish this mission.

27:27.447 --> 27:31.015
They're gonna be $50 each. Cool?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.283
Give me a sweet
poon-tang on three.

27:33.285 --> 27:33.950
Three.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.352
Sweet poon-tang.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.057
You're late for rehearsal, Mijo.

27:42.059 --> 27:43.591
I know, I'm sorry Pop.

27:43.593 --> 27:46.660
And you're wearing your
Banda boots outside the house!

27:46.662 --> 27:50.596
You know they're
strictly for competition.

27:50.598 --> 27:52.431
Now go get dressed, Mijo.

27:52.433 --> 27:56.735
We got a big show at the swap
meet coming up.

28:01.374 --> 28:04.575
It's about time. Ok, places
everyone.

28:06.795 --> 28:09.012
Remember, focus. Smile.
Ok, how many counts was that?

28:09.014 --> 28:18.387
5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8.

28:18.389 --> 28:19.921
Turn.

28:19.923 --> 28:21.389
And again.

29:39.060 --> 29:46.832
MUSIC CONTINUES

29:49.770 --> 29:52.604
PHONE RINGS

29:52.606 --> 30:00.010
Oh, shit. Felicia.

30:00.012 --> 30:01.411
Hey, Beetle.

30:01.413 --> 30:03.112
Hey.

30:03.114 --> 30:08.083
Beetle, I am so sorry. I
just wanted to call to apologize.

30:08.085 --> 30:09.184
What?

30:09.186 --> 30:11.619
Sharky told me what you did.

30:11.621 --> 30:12.486
He did?

30:12.488 --> 30:13.620
Yep.

30:13.622 --> 30:15.822
I think it's pretty cool.

30:15.824 --> 30:19.892
And you're a good friend
to risk your life like that.

30:19.894 --> 30:22.027
I am?

30:22.028 --> 30:24.161
Yeah. He told me how you
waited outside when they went in, and

30:24.164 --> 30:27.165
how you even tackled the cop
when he tried to shoot Sharky.

30:27.167 --> 30:28.733
Sharky told you this?

30:28.735 --> 30:31.001
Yeah. Why didn't you tell me?

30:31.003 --> 30:33.937
I didn't want to brag about it.

30:33.939 --> 30:37.640
Anyhow, I, I
just wanted to apologize.

30:37.642 --> 30:39.675
Is there any way I
can make it up to you?

30:39.677 --> 30:42.577
I don't know. It's pretty
jacked up, sending us out there wrapped

30:42.579 --> 30:43.945
in foil like that.

30:43.947 --> 30:46.580
I know. I'm so sorry.

30:46.582 --> 30:47.948
Well, what are
you doing tomorrow?

30:47.950 --> 30:49.883
Nothing.

30:49.885 --> 30:52.185
You want to meet
up at the park tomorrow,

30:52.187 --> 30:53.920
like you can bring
your friends if you want.

30:53.922 --> 30:55.488
Ok.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.523
Uhhh... 3:30?

30:57.525 --> 30:59.958
Ok. See you there.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.928
Ok. Bye, Felicia.

31:04.830 --> 31:08.064
Yes. Mom!

31:08.066 --> 31:10.866
I need you to iron my
clothes real quick.

31:17.207 --> 31:21.875
Ah, Vieja, You make
the best chili rellenos.

31:21.877 --> 31:23.743
They're delicious, Mom.

31:23.745 --> 31:27.213
Im glad you like them. Octavio?

31:27.215 --> 31:31.716
You barely touched your food!
Is something wrong?

31:31.718 --> 31:33.617
Well, I kind of have a problem.

31:33.619 --> 31:35.518
What is it?

31:35.520 --> 31:38.954
Well, I don't have any money.
I need like $50.

31:38.956 --> 31:41.022
What do you need $50 for?

31:41.024 --> 31:42.656
For a date.

31:42.658 --> 31:46.859
$50 for a date?
What is wrong with you?

31:46.861 --> 31:48.260
Can't you just take
her for a walk

31:48.262 --> 31:49.961
around the block or something?

31:49.963 --> 31:51.495
A walk?

31:51.497 --> 31:52.696
Calmate Viejo.

31:52.698 --> 31:54.998
Girls, girls, girls.
When are you gonna learn?

31:55.000 --> 31:58.201
Banda first, and the
girls will follow.

31:58.203 --> 32:03.839
How do you think I
got your mother?

32:04.041 --> 32:06.508
Oye, Octavio.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.643
I earned this money
on the lottery ticket.

32:08.645 --> 32:13.881
I was gonna put this money in
the jar for our gazebo fund.

32:13.883 --> 32:17.584
This is just one step closer
to building a gazebo in our

32:17.586 --> 32:21.921
backyard, so we can play our
Banda music and have parties.

32:21.923 --> 32:25.291
You know, great fun
for the whole family.

32:25.293 --> 32:29.795
But if you think it's more
important to spend this money

32:29.797 --> 32:34.532
on some girl, then you can be
selfish and take this money

32:34.534 --> 32:37.101
for your date.

32:37.103 --> 32:42.305
Son of a...

32:51.715 --> 32:53.681
<i>Woke up in the morning
got me a warning.</i>

32:53.683 --> 32:55.949
<i>Mama say you better
not get in trouble.</i>

32:55.951 --> 32:58.084
<i>It's a nice summer day
but if you go astray.</i>

32:58.086 --> 33:00.219
<i>I'm gonna have to come
bust your bubble</i>

33:00.221 --> 33:05.190
<i>but I'm out the door
I got no time to hear it.</i>

33:05.192 --> 33:10.862
<i>I'm out the door to where my
troubles can't find me no more.</i>

33:19.138 --> 33:24.006
<i>I know you think you've got all
the</i>

33:24.008 --> 33:28.643
<i>they ain't on the corner with
my homeboys goin' to nowhere.</i>

33:28.645 --> 33:33.114
<i>Walked down the street? What did I see?
The homies were writing graffiti.</i>

33:33.116 --> 33:37.317
<i>Colors so sweet on the hot concrete
could'a' sworn I was still dreaming</i>

33:37.319 --> 33:41.987
<i>and I'm feeling high like
my feet have left the ground.</i>

33:41.989 --> 33:47.224
<i>Feel like I can fly and leave
the world behind.</i>

33:47.226 --> 33:51.828
<i>Guitar solo.</i>

34:42.713 --> 34:44.813
Damn, that sucked.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.214
Man, I can't believe
you trusted that cholo.

34:46.216 --> 34:47.915
He took the last of my bus fare.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.116
We're screwed now.

34:49.118 --> 34:51.351
Maybe we're just not
meant to have fake IDs.

34:51.353 --> 34:53.853
Maybe we just have to rely
on our natural abilities

34:53.855 --> 34:56.188
in order to compete in
the sexual food chain.

34:56.190 --> 34:59.791
Man, you watch
so much nature channel.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.359
Boys!

35:01.361 --> 35:07.464
'Sup?

35:08.767 --> 35:10.733
'Sup Paletas?

35:10.735 --> 35:13.969
You know, I've been
watching you boys for a while now.

35:13.971 --> 35:16.104
Let me ask you something.

35:16.106 --> 35:19.707
Why are you guys so desperate to
get these IDs, huh?

35:19.709 --> 35:22.242
It's a long story.

35:22.244 --> 35:23.743
Our friend,
Beetle, here is a virgin.

35:23.745 --> 35:25.211
Oh, I see.

35:25.212 --> 35:26.678
And we need to take
him to Lola's Love Shack to

35:26.681 --> 35:28.414
get his old sour cherry popped.

35:28.416 --> 35:33.752
Lola's Love Shack.
Yup. That's where I found my 1st amor.

35:33.754 --> 35:39.190
Yeah, she gave me
the gift of love.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.826
But anyway, that's
what the doctor said.

35:42.828 --> 35:45.161
Lola's is just
a dream for us now.

35:45.163 --> 35:49.231
Let me see, now. I
hate to see three fine young boys like

35:49.233 --> 35:53.168
you guys go out without love.
You know what?

35:53.170 --> 35:55.270
I'm gonna hook you guys up.

35:55.272 --> 35:57.539
Hook us up with what?

35:57.540 --> 35:59.807
Fake ID's, stupid.
What do you think-I sell ice cream?

35:59.809 --> 36:01.441
Pendejo

36:01.443 --> 36:04.210
I got to make a living somehow,
buddy. You know what I mean?

36:04.212 --> 36:10.382
All right, first, we
need to get some pictures.

36:10.384 --> 36:12.917
Wait, we just got robbed,
though, we don't have any money.

36:12.919 --> 36:14.852
Hey, y'all hold up, Beetle.

36:14.854 --> 36:19.989
I like to keep my money where
no one will look for it.

36:19.991 --> 36:21.490
But I thought
he got your wallet?

36:21.492 --> 36:24.860
No, man, I just keep a
couple of bucks in there as a decoy.

36:24.862 --> 36:26.361
But I like to keep my big
piggy bank tucked

36:26.363 --> 36:29.330
right underneath my ball sac.

36:29.332 --> 36:32.733
It's a little sweaty, but
it's just the top layer.

36:32.735 --> 36:34.434
Boy, that is disgusting.

36:34.436 --> 36:37.003
Lucky for you, I'm a romantic.

36:37.005 --> 36:39.505
So I'll take the cash
for the pictures.

36:39.507 --> 36:42.841
Hell yeah.

36:42.843 --> 36:47.345
Back up, back up. All right.

36:47.347 --> 36:49.080
Just gonna get some
pictures over here.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.098
Who's first?

36:50.099 --> 36:51.115
Beetle.

36:51.117 --> 36:53.283
All right, buddy.

36:53.285 --> 36:54.384
Uh, listen, don't look so
serious,

36:54.386 --> 36:55.785
you look like a refugee.

36:55.787 --> 36:58.154
Smile a little bit.
There you go.

37:01.992 --> 37:03.358
Damn, these look real.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.860
Mine says Chase P. Nocha.

37:05.862 --> 37:07.845
What name did you use?

37:07.846 --> 37:09.829
Oliver Coochie, coz
that's all I'm gonna settle for.

37:09.832 --> 37:11.765
And I'm Sal T. Huevos.

37:11.767 --> 37:13.032
That means I got the cojones.

37:13.034 --> 37:15.000
Sounds more like you
gotta air out your nuts.

37:15.002 --> 37:16.334
Man, look who's talking!

37:16.336 --> 37:18.402
I can't believe that
guy even took your money.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.871
You nasty.

37:20.873 --> 37:22.105
Guys, will these IDs even work?

37:22.107 --> 37:25.274
There's only
one way to find out.

37:32.248 --> 37:34.348
Hey, there's Lucy Loose Lips.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.049
I heard they call her
that 'cos she talks so much.

37:36.051 --> 37:37.634
Dude, you're an idiot.

37:37.635 --> 37:39.218
They call her that because she
blew the entire wrestling team.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.552
Dumb ass.

37:40.554 --> 37:42.186
What do we do, Sharky?

37:42.188 --> 37:44.154
All right, Beetle,
looks like you're up to bat.

37:44.156 --> 37:45.922
Go see if she wants to
have some drinks with us.

37:45.924 --> 37:47.423
Hey, why do you
always send this fool first?

37:47.425 --> 37:48.524
I got more game than him.

37:48.526 --> 37:50.025
Not even, fool.

37:50.027 --> 37:51.259
Dude, he's never gotten any.

37:51.261 --> 37:52.460
You said you ain't a virgin.

37:52.462 --> 37:54.528
Oh, yeah.

37:54.530 --> 37:57.197
Let the virgin go first.

38:03.471 --> 38:04.970
Hey, Sharky.

38:04.972 --> 38:06.271
Yo, what's up?

38:06.273 --> 38:08.506
What does it
feel like to get laid?

38:08.508 --> 38:10.474
You, too, huh?

38:10.476 --> 38:12.042
I knew it, fool.

38:12.044 --> 38:14.811
Watch and learn.

38:14.813 --> 38:20.315
Jonas Brothers,
they're pretty good.

38:20.317 --> 38:24.818
Are you into them or what?

38:24.820 --> 38:25.985
All right, you know what?

38:25.987 --> 38:27.052
Forget you, then.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.486
The Jonas Brothers...

38:28.488 --> 38:30.254
they should be called The Bone
Us Brothers, 'cos they

38:30.256 --> 38:34.258
look like they want it up the
butt from an escaped convict.

38:34.260 --> 38:37.961
Sorry, I couldn't hear.
Were you saying something?

38:37.963 --> 38:39.996
Oh, the Jonas Brothers.

38:39.998 --> 38:41.597
I'm nuts for them,
like an escaped convict,

38:41.599 --> 38:43.399
I love them.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.200
Oh, yeah? I love, love,
love the Jonas Brothers.

38:45.202 --> 38:46.601
Lucy, I'm
Beetle, and I was just.

38:46.603 --> 38:48.135
You know my name?

38:48.137 --> 38:49.836
Yeah, we go to
the same high school.

38:49.838 --> 38:51.421
We do?

38:51.422 --> 38:53.005
Yeah, it's cool. I mean,
well, I was just wondering

38:53.007 --> 38:54.473
if you wanted to have a drink
with me and my friends?

38:54.475 --> 38:56.174
You guys can score?

38:56.176 --> 38:57.608
Hell, yeah. I've got an ID.

38:57.610 --> 38:59.509
My god, can you
get me Booze Farms?

38:59.511 --> 39:01.561
Yeah, sure.

39:01.562 --> 39:03.612
I love Booze Farms.
Once, I drank a whole bottle

39:03.615 --> 39:05.381
and totally passed out.

39:05.383 --> 39:07.015
And I wasn't even
hung over the next day.

39:07.017 --> 39:09.050
I'm impressed. That's awesome.

39:09.052 --> 39:10.618
I think it's
because we mixed it.

39:10.620 --> 39:14.154
They got cranberry, mixed it
with grape. They call it crape.

39:14.156 --> 39:16.556
But you don't have to get both,
just grape is fine.

39:16.558 --> 39:17.356
Ok.

39:17.358 --> 39:18.523
Do you like grape?

39:18.525 --> 39:21.325
Yeah. I'll be right back, ok?

39:21.327 --> 39:22.571
Ok.

39:22.572 --> 39:23.816
All right.

39:23.817 --> 39:25.061
Hey. It was really
good running into you.

39:25.064 --> 39:28.498
Yeah.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.903
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

39:33.905 --> 39:38.440
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Here you go.

39:39.976 --> 39:42.609
Oliver Coochie?

39:42.611 --> 39:45.078
It's pronounced Kee-yoo-chee.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.913
Ky-oochie?

39:46.915 --> 39:48.481
Q-Chee.

39:48.483 --> 39:50.149
Coo-Chee.

39:50.151 --> 39:52.050
Q-cheeee.

39:52.052 --> 39:53.384
Coochie.

39:53.386 --> 39:54.618
Coochie.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.152
Coochie.

39:56.154 --> 39:59.121
Yeah, that's it. Kewchi.

39:59.123 --> 40:02.023
Coochie.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.959
That'll be twelve dollars.

40:04.961 --> 40:08.028
It should all be in there.

40:16.504 --> 40:17.436
Thank you.

40:17.437 --> 40:18.369
Have a good day, Mr. Coochie.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.338
Yeah, you too.

42:18.324 --> 42:20.490
If you guys want
to have sex with me,

42:20.492 --> 42:22.558
you have to wear a rubber.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.761
And one at a time, ok?
I'm not a skank.

42:26.763 --> 42:33.734
Huddle.

42:33.736 --> 42:37.270
I don't know, guys.
I wouldn't touch it.

42:37.272 --> 42:39.272
If I were you, I wouldn't
touch it either.

42:39.274 --> 42:40.773
Yeah, I'm gonna
wait 'til Felicia gets here.

42:40.775 --> 42:44.109
Oh, she's coming here man?
She bringing her friends?

42:44.111 --> 42:46.778
I don't give a damn. I'm
gonna go for it right now,.

42:46.780 --> 42:49.247
Damn, fool, you
don't even have a condom.

42:49.249 --> 42:54.418
What you think I'm an idiot?

42:57.523 --> 43:01.358
Dumb ass, this is a wet nap.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.294
Come on you guys, are
we gonna screw or what?

43:04.296 --> 43:05.561
Hold on one second.

43:05.563 --> 43:10.165
I don't care,
I'm going for it. Move.

43:27.850 --> 43:30.250
Come here. Show me
what you're working with.

43:30.252 --> 43:33.519
No, you take off your top first.

43:33.521 --> 43:35.921
Ok.

43:41.728 --> 43:43.794
Don't be shy Joker.

43:43.796 --> 43:45.462
Just go to sleep.

43:45.464 --> 43:48.398
Awwwe...

43:52.536 --> 43:55.370
My head it spinning.

43:55.372 --> 43:56.537
You all right?

43:56.539 --> 43:59.139
Oh.

43:59.141 --> 44:02.642
Screwed up with the coach, man.

44:02.644 --> 44:07.145
So what, man? Screw that guy.

44:07.147 --> 44:14.385
Yeah, screw him, Screw
me, screw everybody. I'm screwed.

44:14.387 --> 44:17.354
Ah Sharky, it's just a game man,

44:17.356 --> 44:18.722
It's just a game, buddy.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.490
Man, get off me, man.

44:20.492 --> 44:22.725
Just a game.

44:22.727 --> 44:23.625
Hey, what time is it?

44:23.627 --> 44:25.160
It's like 3:30.

44:25.161 --> 44:26.694
Oh shit, she's
gonna be here, soon, dude.

44:26.696 --> 44:27.695
Right on, dog.

44:27.697 --> 44:29.396
Hey, what about Joker?

44:29.398 --> 44:31.731
Well, what about him? Leave him.

44:31.733 --> 44:32.865
Yo man, we got to stop him.

44:32.867 --> 44:34.111
No, man.

44:34.112 --> 44:35.356
I gotta stop him, man.

44:35.357 --> 44:36.601
He's cool, man, he's cool.

44:36.604 --> 44:44.909
Wait. Joker, you better
rethink this, man. Joker, Joker. Hey.

44:44.911 --> 44:46.577
Hey, you better put your
pants on, big boy.

44:46.579 --> 44:49.880
Your date's passed out.

44:49.882 --> 44:51.748
What are you doing, dick head?

44:51.750 --> 44:54.484
You trying to pull my pants on,
I'll pull your pants down.

44:54.486 --> 44:56.385
I'm trying to put
your pants back on, look.

44:56.387 --> 44:57.886
Your date's passed out, and
you're about to bone her

44:57.888 --> 44:58.920
with a wet nap.

44:58.922 --> 45:01.622
Oh, shit, Beetle. You saved me.

45:01.624 --> 45:06.225
I love you. You're my favorite
homie.

45:06.227 --> 45:08.660
Yeah, I'm your favorite?

45:08.662 --> 45:10.928
Oh, you saved me from
making a terrible mistake,

45:10.930 --> 45:13.897
Beetle. My chorizo could
have dried up,

45:13.899 --> 45:16.332
shriveled away or something.

45:16.334 --> 45:18.200
Yeah. You need
to get up, though.

45:18.202 --> 45:19.017
No, no.

45:19.018 --> 45:19.833
You should get dressed, man.

45:19.836 --> 45:21.802
My pants are down.

45:21.804 --> 45:24.404
Oh, my god.

45:24.406 --> 45:28.508
You are a pervert.
Have fun with your tramp.

45:28.510 --> 45:30.643
Wait, Felicia. It's not
what it looks like, I promise you.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.945
I'm just tired of your stories.

45:32.947 --> 45:34.613
You're just a complete dog.

45:34.615 --> 45:37.582
Oh. Beetle.

45:47.927 --> 45:51.228
Well, I guess that does it.
Felicia will never

45:51.230 --> 45:54.264
ever talk to me again.

45:54.266 --> 45:57.967
Forget about Felicia.

45:57.969 --> 45:59.335
Forget about Felicia.

45:59.337 --> 46:00.920
I don't want to.

46:00.921 --> 46:02.504
There's plenty of
ho's out there, Beetle.

46:02.506 --> 46:04.339
Look, at least our ID's worked.

46:04.341 --> 46:05.773
Now we can get into Lola's.

46:05.775 --> 46:07.741
How are we gonna
get the money for that?

46:07.743 --> 46:12.411
I don't know. But
we're gonna roll up in style.

46:12.413 --> 46:13.378
Hey guys, I feel better now,

46:13.380 --> 46:15.480
I puked it all out.
I feel great.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.814
Your breath
smells like Lucy's ass.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.448
So what, your breath
smells like Hobo Dick.

46:18.450 --> 46:25.488
Ok, ladies. I got
something to show you.

46:33.464 --> 46:35.863
Check it out.

46:38.834 --> 46:41.401
Damn, this is nice.

46:41.403 --> 46:42.969
That is bad ass, Sharky.

46:42.971 --> 46:46.705
Yeah, it's my brother's.
I mean, he ain't using it.

46:46.707 --> 46:49.340
Needs a little work.

46:49.342 --> 46:54.411
Yeah, we fix this up, we're
gonna get the royal treatment.

46:54.413 --> 46:55.812
I'm sorry I
ever doubted you, man.

46:55.814 --> 46:58.381
This is bad-ass. We're gonna
get laid for sure now.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.749
So. The faith is back?

46:59.751 --> 47:04.386
Hell yeah. Hey,
I just got an idea.

47:04.388 --> 47:06.388
I know how we can get the
money to fix up the car

47:06.390 --> 47:07.689
and go to Lola's Love Shack.

47:07.691 --> 47:09.023
How we gonna get
that kind of money?

47:09.025 --> 47:10.891
What are you
talking about dumb ass?

47:10.893 --> 47:12.926
This is the land of opportunity.

47:12.928 --> 47:15.295
In this country, if you want
something, you get it.

47:15.297 --> 47:16.763
Doesn't matter if you're short,

47:16.765 --> 47:19.832
fat, skinny, white,
brown, black.

47:19.834 --> 47:21.466
Legal or illegal.

47:21.468 --> 47:22.834
If you want something,
you get it.

47:22.836 --> 47:26.370
You want to get laid?
No, we will get laid.

47:26.372 --> 47:28.038
We will go to Lola's
Love Shack tomorrow.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.540
Are you serious?

47:29.541 --> 47:31.041
You guys should be
at my place at 5AM tomorrow,

47:31.043 --> 47:32.776
bring some work clothes.

47:32.778 --> 47:36.079
Get ready to live
the American Dream.

47:47.692 --> 47:49.058
This ain't no American dream.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.893
It's more like a
Mexican nightmare.

47:50.895 --> 47:53.028
Hey, hey. Whatever
buys a dream, buddy. Right?

47:53.030 --> 47:53.695
Simone.

47:53.697 --> 47:55.596
All right.

47:55.598 --> 47:57.581
Right. Right here, right
here, right here.

47:57.582 --> 47:59.565
Hey, guys. I need ten
guys, fifty bucks a day,

47:59.568 --> 48:01.000
anybody here speak English?

48:01.002 --> 48:02.701
I do, Senior.
Me speak-a the English.

48:02.703 --> 48:05.637
All right. Do me a favor, ask
these guys if any of them have

48:05.639 --> 48:07.872
any experience with
demolition and clean-up?

48:07.874 --> 48:08.739
Ok, yeah, yeah.

48:13.411 --> 48:14.609
So sorry Senior.

48:17.080 --> 48:17.912
What's he saying?

48:17.914 --> 48:19.513
He needs higher wages.

48:19.515 --> 48:22.382
Higher wages?
Are you shitting me?

48:22.384 --> 48:24.450
All right, I'll tell you
what, tell 'em $70

48:24.452 --> 48:25.717
is as high as I can go.

48:30.756 --> 48:31.921
He wants a hundred.

48:31.923 --> 48:33.422
A hundred?

48:33.424 --> 48:36.265
Senior, trust me.
We work twice as hard.

48:36.291 --> 48:37.458
We get the job done.

48:37.460 --> 48:40.093
All right, load 'em up.

48:50.671 --> 48:54.472
All right, everyone's getting
their seat belts on?

49:42.987 --> 49:46.788
MUSIC OUT

49:46.790 --> 49:51.091
All right, man, great job today.
You really earned this.

49:51.093 --> 49:51.991
Here you are.

49:51.993 --> 49:54.927
Thank you, sir.

49:54.929 --> 49:56.128
Good work.

49:56.130 --> 49:57.596
Thank you.

49:57.598 --> 50:02.233
Great job.

50:06.072 --> 50:10.073
Got to hand it to you, Beetle.
You're a clever man.

50:10.075 --> 50:11.474
I think I'll be a sports agent

50:11.476 --> 50:12.641
and negotiate your
contracts for you.

50:12.643 --> 50:14.009
Sh, you're hired, homie.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.677
Now I can afford
a new silk shirt.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.979
Now you can afford
to get some boxers and shit.

50:17.981 --> 50:19.680
Get rid of those
banana hammocks.

50:19.682 --> 50:21.048
So what? At least
I can fill them up.

50:21.050 --> 50:22.416
You can't fill
up a peanut shell.

50:22.418 --> 50:23.850
Shut up, fool.

50:26.554 --> 50:29.788
No, no, no it's all good.

50:29.790 --> 50:31.856
Thank you friend, thank you.

50:31.858 --> 50:35.559
Hey man. You
know what you did for us?

50:35.561 --> 50:37.827
Any time you need
us, you call me, ok?

50:37.829 --> 50:39.995
Ok.

50:39.997 --> 50:41.796
Gracias. Gracias.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.570
That guy likes you.

50:50.572 --> 50:53.940
Lola's Love Shack, here we go.

50:53.942 --> 50:55.274
Oh, let's roll.

50:58.178 --> 51:00.945
I'm gonna go to her
and tell her like this.

51:00.947 --> 51:03.580
I want you to go
down on me, girl.

51:03.582 --> 51:05.782
I want you to do me right.

51:05.784 --> 51:08.851
Then, I'm gonna put it in
her grill and I'm like oh,

51:08.853 --> 51:12.854
yeah, oh, yeah.

51:12.856 --> 51:16.991
Oh God, I'm coming, I'm
coming. Oh.

51:16.993 --> 51:21.895
Hey, you morons stop playing
around while I'm down there?

51:21.897 --> 51:25.932
All right, well, that's it.
Beetle, fire it up.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.505
Hey. Let's go tonight.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.708
How much we got?

51:36.710 --> 51:38.509
This much.

51:38.511 --> 51:41.111
Ok, that won't get us
a midget's nipple at Lola's.

51:41.113 --> 51:43.079
You know what, guys?
You guys stepped up.

51:43.081 --> 51:46.549
So now it's time for me to step
it up, too. Trust me, guys.

51:46.551 --> 51:47.983
I know where to get the money.

51:47.985 --> 51:50.151
Tomorrow, we'll be Don Juans,

51:50.153 --> 51:53.954
because we're gonna do it
'til they don juan no more.

51:53.956 --> 51:55.722
All right, just
don't say that to the girls,

51:55.724 --> 51:58.257
all right, man? Hey, man.
I'm just telling you.

51:58.259 --> 51:59.658
All right, ladies.

51:59.660 --> 52:02.827
So go home, get some
rest, for tomorrow,

52:02.829 --> 52:05.129
you will be men.

52:05.131 --> 52:07.764
Sweet poon-tang on
three right here.

52:07.766 --> 52:08.598
Three.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.633
Sweet Poon-tang.

54:04.314 --> 54:09.083
Sharky. Whassup, doggie?

54:09.085 --> 54:12.820
'Sup, dog?

54:12.822 --> 54:15.022
What are you all dressed up for?

54:15.024 --> 54:16.824
I want to look presentable.

54:16.825 --> 54:18.625
You look like
you're going to a funeral.

54:18.627 --> 54:21.160
Ha-ha, looks like Los Tigres
Del Norte puked on your shirt.

54:21.162 --> 54:23.328
The women love this look.
It's silk, see how soft it is?

54:23.330 --> 54:25.263
Get off me. That is pretty soft.

54:25.265 --> 54:31.335
Ok, you ladies look
very pretty tonight. Let's roll.

54:31.337 --> 54:33.003
Let's represent, Homies.

54:33.005 --> 54:43.113
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

54:43.115 --> 54:53.123
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

54:53.125 --> 55:03.133
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

55:03.135 --> 55:17.146
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

55:17.148 --> 55:21.183
Woo hoo! Here we come!

55:26.723 --> 55:28.355
Looks like there's nothing here.

55:28.357 --> 55:30.890
Are you sure you
got the right directions?

55:30.892 --> 55:34.193
Look, it's underground.
It's not supposed to be seen.

55:34.195 --> 55:38.029
The guy said it was around here.

55:38.031 --> 55:41.265
Look. Door. Beetle. Knock.

55:41.267 --> 55:43.133
I'm not gonna knock.
You go knock.

55:43.135 --> 55:47.269
Joker, knock.

55:47.271 --> 55:49.871
Wait, and what do I say?

55:49.873 --> 55:51.706
Just tell him like
the man said, you got a

55:51.708 --> 55:54.241
message for Lola, right?

55:54.243 --> 56:00.380
All right, here goes nothing.

56:00.915 --> 56:02.180
Who is it?

56:02.182 --> 56:04.882
I got a message for Lola?

56:04.884 --> 56:06.483
Yeah, what's the message?

56:06.485 --> 56:09.719
I got to tell her personally.

56:09.721 --> 56:12.488
Go away kid,
there's no Lola here.

56:12.490 --> 56:14.240
Oop, she's not here, let's go.

56:14.241 --> 56:15.991
Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.
We worked way too hard to get here.

56:15.993 --> 56:17.025
We can't just leave now.

56:17.027 --> 56:20.294
It's the wrong place.

56:20.296 --> 56:21.828
Good night, Mr. Morales.

56:21.830 --> 56:24.063
See you tomorrow night, Joey.

56:24.065 --> 56:25.798
Hey, it's Paletas. Hey Paletas!

56:25.800 --> 56:28.551
MR, RALPH: Hey, hey, who's that?

56:28.552 --> 56:31.303
What's up? Remember us?
You told us about this place.

56:31.305 --> 56:35.273
Oh my god.
It's the blue balls crew!

56:35.275 --> 56:36.474
How are you, boys?

56:36.476 --> 56:38.209
Hey, congratulations.
You found the place, huh?

56:38.211 --> 56:41.512
Yeah, we found it,
but he won't let us in.

56:41.514 --> 56:43.947
Well, did you tell him
that you had a message for Lola?

56:43.949 --> 56:45.381
Yeah, I told him that.

56:45.383 --> 56:48.751
And did you mention
that Benjamin Franklin

56:48.753 --> 56:50.119
wanted to talk to her?

56:50.121 --> 56:52.788
No.

56:52.790 --> 56:59.994
MR, RALPH: Pandejos. Boys.
A little money goes a long way, huh?

56:59.996 --> 57:02.763
Come on, snap out of it.
Look, I got to go.

57:02.765 --> 57:04.965
Lola doesn't like crowds hanging
around the place, hey?

57:04.967 --> 57:08.001
Good luck. Get laid.

57:08.003 --> 57:09.369
Thanks, man.

57:09.371 --> 57:12.605
All right. You heard the man.
Let's get inside.

57:15.943 --> 57:19.144
Knock, buey.

57:27.220 --> 57:29.453
You again?

57:29.455 --> 57:31.922
Yeah, we have
a message for Lola.

57:31.924 --> 57:34.324
From Benjamin Franklin.

57:34.326 --> 57:37.827
Well, what is it?

57:37.829 --> 57:40.996
I got a boner
that needs your guidance.

57:40.998 --> 57:44.165
You little punk.
I'm gonna bash your face in.

57:44.167 --> 57:47.168
Hey, what he meant to
say is that he wants to tip you.

57:47.170 --> 57:49.235
Generously.

57:52.039 --> 57:54.239
You better cool
it with the smart-ass shit.

57:54.241 --> 58:03.548
You got me? Come on.
Ok, this is how it's gonna go.

58:03.550 --> 58:06.851
You're gonna go up there through
those doors and see Lola.

58:06.853 --> 58:09.553
You do exactly what
she tells you to do.

58:09.555 --> 58:14.156
She will introduce - don't touch
that. Don't touch anything.

58:14.158 --> 58:18.059
All right. And then she'll
introduce you to the girls.

58:18.061 --> 58:19.860
You boys are over 18, right?

58:19.862 --> 58:21.027
Of course we are.

58:21.029 --> 58:22.094
Yeah, yeah,
show me your ID, my man.

58:22.096 --> 58:30.936
I'm 23, though.

58:30.938 --> 58:33.438
Uh, yeah, I'm
gonna hang onto these.

58:33.440 --> 58:34.406
You can pick 'em
up on the way out.

58:34.407 --> 58:35.373
You got it, boss.

58:35.375 --> 58:40.010
Go upstairs. Go.

58:49.887 --> 58:57.058
Don't touch nothing,
you little shits.

59:07.603 --> 59:09.369
This is weird.

59:09.371 --> 59:11.537
This is not how I imagined it.

59:11.539 --> 59:18.176
Where are the girls?

59:18.178 --> 59:22.280
Somebody has a message for me?

59:22.282 --> 59:28.118
Yeah. I have a boner
that needs your guidance.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.053
Well, you boys got money?

59:30.055 --> 59:31.954
Sure do.

59:31.956 --> 59:39.127
Put it on the table.
What do you want?

59:39.129 --> 59:40.962
We want to meet
some of your girls.

59:40.964 --> 59:43.898
Well, you found the place.
And you got in.

59:43.900 --> 59:47.034
But I mean, I don't
know who sent you.

59:47.036 --> 59:52.172
So I'm gonna have to
do a test. Drop your pants.

59:52.174 --> 59:54.674
I don't know lady, we
put the money on the table.

59:54.676 --> 59:56.142
We just want to meet the girls.

59:56.144 --> 59:59.044
You either drop your pants,
or you go back home to your mamas.

59:59.046 --> 01:00:04.149
All right. Fine.
Let's just do it, guys.

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:14.124
Oh, ok. Not bad.

01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:18.328
That tickles.

01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:24.033
Oh, very impressive.

01:00:24.035 --> 01:00:24.933
Thank you.

01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:26.567
And even a haircut.

01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:28.702
Thank you.

01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:37.942
Can you lift up your stomach?

01:00:37.944 --> 01:00:41.111
What do you think you're
gonna do with that?

01:00:41.113 --> 01:00:44.581
I'm a grower, not a show-er.

01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:49.485
I'm sorry, sonny.
Even my girls have standards.

01:00:49.487 --> 01:00:51.987
Come on, lady. We didn't
come here to get insulted.

01:00:51.989 --> 01:00:54.122
We just want to meet
some of your girls.

01:00:54.124 --> 01:01:01.362
All right. Buddy.
You got it. Chicas.

01:01:41.136 --> 01:01:42.768
Sharky, what do you want to do?

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.138
I don't know, pick one.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.406
All right. Uhm I'll
take that one on the right.

01:01:48.408 --> 01:01:50.508
That's the one I wanted.

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:52.042
Fine, I'll pick another one.

01:01:52.044 --> 01:01:53.777
Well, we can share
if you want, Beetle.

01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:54.744
Get off of me.

01:01:54.746 --> 01:01:56.145
I want to remember
this as a good time,

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.346
not be scarred for life.

01:01:57.348 --> 01:01:59.181
Fine, then which
one do you choose?

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:01.683
I'll take her.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:07.754
I don't know which one to pick.
My leg's shaking. Uhm.

01:02:07.756 --> 01:02:11.257
We're gonna have a
two-for-one special tonight.

01:02:11.259 --> 01:02:17.629
Now, these girls are identical
in every way. Except one.

01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:21.766
Two for one? Oh my God I
love this place. I'll take them.

01:02:21.768 --> 01:02:29.640
Hey, Mina, Cherry, twins,
show these men to the back room.

01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:42.151
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:42.153 --> 01:02:43.318
Sure.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.486
Do you like my boobs?

01:02:45.488 --> 01:02:48.288
I think it's cute how they
point in different directions.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:52.358
Do they feel natural?

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.659
They feel great.

01:02:53.661 --> 01:02:59.497
Oh. So cute.

01:02:59.499 --> 01:03:04.567
Hmmm. Oh, ladies, I'm
going to do things to you

01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:06.769
you've never had done before.

01:03:06.771 --> 01:03:14.509
Oh, you mean you're gonna.

01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:19.546
Um. No. Not that.

01:03:19.548 --> 01:03:22.615
You mean you're
gonna pay us double?

01:03:22.617 --> 01:03:25.718
Not that, either... Yeah...

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.286
You're beautiful.

01:03:27.288 --> 01:03:31.332
Oh, thanks. I
really like your shirt.

01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:32.590
It's so soft.

01:03:32.592 --> 01:03:34.525
Look. I got you something.

01:03:34.527 --> 01:03:35.425
Oh. What?

01:03:35.427 --> 01:03:38.227
It comes from a clam.

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:39.828
I think you mean oyster.

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:42.397
Really?

01:03:42.399 --> 01:03:48.469
Thanks. But you shouldn't have.

01:03:48.471 --> 01:03:51.271
Sharky said you'll
love a pearl necklace.

01:03:51.273 --> 01:03:59.178
Oh. You're so cute.
But you really shouldn't be here.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.481
No, I really like you. It's just
you really should be going.

01:04:03.483 --> 01:04:05.783
It's Lola.

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:08.218
What was that?

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.186
That means we gotta go.

01:04:10.188 --> 01:04:12.454
But we'll be right back.
So get ready for us, ok?

01:04:12.456 --> 01:04:15.423
Ok, I'm ready.

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:18.793
Oh, man, I get two of them.

01:04:18.795 --> 01:04:22.530
Oh, my God, she loves my shirt.
She gave me her number.

01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:24.231
I'm starting
to get nervous, guys.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:25.465
What, nervous? What for?

01:04:25.467 --> 01:04:28.234
Just do whatever comes natural.

01:04:28.236 --> 01:04:31.136
Whassup, homie?
Whoa. Hey, man, get off me.

01:04:38.677 --> 01:04:43.879
And I better not catch
you jag-offs back here again.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.580
Man, open this door.

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.716
Come on, man,
let's get out of here.

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:51.851
Man, get off me, man.
Open this door. Get off me!

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.521
I'll burn this place down.

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.622
Come on.

01:04:55.624 --> 01:04:57.323
Mina.

01:04:57.325 --> 01:04:59.391
Come on.

01:05:03.396 --> 01:05:08.431
Man, I'm never
gonna see Mina again.

01:05:08.433 --> 01:05:11.467
Man, that was some bullshit.

01:05:11.469 --> 01:05:13.402
You know, she never would
have played us like that if

01:05:13.404 --> 01:05:15.737
we were rolling
with the Mafiosos.

01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:19.741
What a dumb ass move, man.
Can't believe I even listen to you.

01:05:19.743 --> 01:05:21.542
Well, maybe I'm not
as smart as you, Beetle.

01:05:21.544 --> 01:05:23.944
Get off me.

01:05:23.946 --> 01:05:28.380
Oh, shit, here
comes your stepdad.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:30.782
Where the hell
did you go tonight?

01:05:30.784 --> 01:05:32.683
What's it to you?

01:05:32.685 --> 01:05:36.620
What's it to me?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

01:05:36.622 --> 01:05:39.222
You think you can just go out
and do what you want, huh?

01:05:39.224 --> 01:05:40.723
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:40.725 --> 01:05:42.758
Yeah, and now that
you fixed your brother's car,

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.395
you can go out cruising
and be like him?

01:05:47.397 --> 01:05:48.796
I'm not like him, John.

01:05:48.798 --> 01:05:52.199
You're a liar, Danny.
Your mother got a call today.

01:05:52.201 --> 01:05:59.272
They said that you were kicked
off the team for drinking.

01:05:59.274 --> 01:06:01.240
You're a loser.

01:06:01.242 --> 01:06:03.542
You're gonna end up
in prison like Hector.

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:05.844
Why don't you shut your mouth?

01:06:05.846 --> 01:06:08.580
Oh, you think you're
bad now, huh? You think -

01:06:08.582 --> 01:06:10.648
Come on! Come on!

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:16.386
You little punk.

01:06:25.964 --> 01:06:30.666
Mr. Alba? You think
we could get a ride home now?

01:06:44.247 --> 01:06:50.484
Octavio, get
over here right now.

01:06:56.657 --> 01:06:58.857
Where is the gazebo money?

01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:00.758
Somebody stole it?

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.495
I found this in his pocket.

01:07:04.497 --> 01:07:08.998
You're kidding me? You spent
the gazebo fund on hookers?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.599
How do you know it's hookers?

01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:13.368
Never mind how I know.
This is about Octavio.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:17.972
Look how upset you made
your mother. Now sit down.

01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:20.341
That's Sharky's.

01:07:20.343 --> 01:07:22.710
Que cochino, Octavio.

01:07:22.712 --> 01:07:25.479
Yeah, you like hookers.
You're a cochino.

01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:26.580
Shut up.

01:07:26.582 --> 01:07:28.782
Go to your room.

01:07:28.784 --> 01:07:31.017
The entire family
is disappointed in you.

01:07:31.019 --> 01:07:33.352
You have been
selfish and thoughtless.

01:07:33.354 --> 01:07:35.320
And a cochino.

01:07:35.322 --> 01:07:36.621
And a cochino.

01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:40.024
We are seriously considering
putting you up for adoption.

01:07:40.026 --> 01:07:42.593
Now get out of our
faces and get to your room.

01:07:42.595 --> 01:07:45.429
You are officially
out of the Banda.

01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:54.037
Hey, Felicia. Hello, Felicia.
Hello. Hi. Yo. Yo, Felicia.

01:07:54.039 --> 01:07:57.407
Look, about this pervert stuff.

01:07:57.409 --> 01:08:03.011
Hi, Felicia. You know I'm not
really a pervert, right?

01:08:03.013 --> 01:08:06.414
I am not a pervert, Felicia.
I am not a pervert.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:19.492
Oh
My god baby, it feels so good!

01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:21.493
Oh my god, It's so big.

01:08:21.496 --> 01:08:22.962
I know.

01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:30.801
It scares me.

01:08:30.804 --> 01:08:32.921
No way.

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:35.038
What the hell? Beetle.
What's wrong with you?

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:36.939
Wait a minute, I
came here today to apologize,

01:08:36.942 --> 01:08:40.475
and you're all watching a porno.
I'm the pervert?

01:08:40.478 --> 01:08:42.644
Would it be fair if I called
y'all a bunch of sluts?

01:08:42.645 --> 01:08:43.877
You're not
gonna come into my house

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.845
and call me a slut.

01:08:44.846 --> 01:08:46.145
You must be tripping.

01:08:46.147 --> 01:08:47.446
Felicia, you just gonna
let him get away with it?

01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:48.746
Wait a minute.
Let's hear him out.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.816
Look, Felicia. I
know the way things are don't

01:08:50.818 --> 01:08:52.350
make me look too good.

01:08:52.352 --> 01:08:57.087
These are for you. Please.
Felicia. Honestly,

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:59.022
all I ever wanted was to
get to know you better.

01:08:59.024 --> 01:09:01.724
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever known,

01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:03.358
and I swear if you
give me just one,

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:07.761
just one more chance, I'll
never do you wrong again.

01:09:07.763 --> 01:09:10.029
What about Lucy Loose Lips?

01:09:10.031 --> 01:09:12.798
What about Lucy?
Joker' the one that wanted her.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.866
I was just trying to stop
him before you got there.

01:09:14.868 --> 01:09:16.133
I never wanted to touch Lucy.

01:09:16.135 --> 01:09:19.636
I wanted - I wanted to touch
you.

01:09:19.638 --> 01:09:20.502
I, I'm sorry. I just.

01:09:20.505 --> 01:09:22.738
Beetle, stop.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.374
You had me at you're
a bunch of sluts.

01:09:26.376 --> 01:09:28.542
And they let you stay?

01:09:28.544 --> 01:09:33.078
Yep. I ended up watching
porn with them for 3 hours, dude.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.913
It was hot.

01:09:34.916 --> 01:09:38.082
That's crazy.

01:09:38.085 --> 01:09:39.884
Hey, man, you
didn't mean what you were

01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:42.152
saying about those Mafiosos,
did you?

01:09:42.154 --> 01:09:44.087
Hell yeah, I did.

01:09:44.089 --> 01:09:46.522
Dude, we can try
to talk to the coach.

01:09:46.524 --> 01:09:51.893
I mean, maybe he'll
give you another chance or

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.011
something.

01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:54.127
Camp started today.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:55.696
And I'm not there.

01:09:55.698 --> 01:09:57.898
I'm off the team, I got nothing.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.799
What are you talking about?

01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:02.568
I ain't getting outta the hood.

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:06.805
Baseball was my only shot.

01:10:06.807 --> 01:10:08.740
You can still
fix this, Sharky...

01:10:08.742 --> 01:10:09.640
what can we do?

01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:11.292
We got to think about something.

01:10:11.293 --> 01:10:12.943
Well, Beetle, what
do you know about my shit?

01:10:12.945 --> 01:10:13.877
You get good grades.

01:10:13.879 --> 01:10:16.546
You can go to any
college you want.

01:10:16.548 --> 01:10:18.048
You have no

01:10:18.049 --> 01:10:19.549
idea what I have
to go through, man.

01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:20.750
You don't even know this but.

01:10:20.752 --> 01:10:22.184
I'm not even a citizen.

01:10:22.186 --> 01:10:23.618
What?

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.653
Bullshit, man.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.054
You're an illegal?

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.305
Yeah, right.

01:10:28.306 --> 01:10:29.555
I've known you
since the first grade.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.524
Mom brought
me here when I was 2.

01:10:31.526 --> 01:10:34.426
Damn.

01:10:34.428 --> 01:10:36.661
You're a pinche mojado
and nobody ever knew it.

01:10:36.663 --> 01:10:39.597
Yeah, I can't let
that stop me, though.

01:10:43.603 --> 01:10:44.969
I don't got
time for that right now.

01:10:44.971 --> 01:10:49.038
You better get out of here.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.706
Are they coming to jump you in?

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:52.774
Yo, get outta here, Beetle.

01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:00.780
Yo, Beetle, get outta here, man.

01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:12.924
So, today's
the day, little Sharky.

01:11:12.926 --> 01:11:14.992
You're gonna be made a Mafioso.

01:11:25.003 --> 01:11:25.901
Let's get ready to do this.

01:11:25.903 --> 01:11:26.869
On three.

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:27.836
Hold up, let me tie my shoe.

01:11:27.838 --> 01:11:29.737
No, it's too
late to turn back now.

01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:32.906
One. Two.

01:11:32.908 --> 01:11:35.108
Hey! Let go of Sharky.

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:36.609
Hey, get out of here, Beetle.
Ain't nobody

01:11:36.611 --> 01:11:38.877
trying to talk to you. Come on
homies, let's do this.

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:41.713
Oh yeah? Well, I got
somebody that wants to talk to you.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.847
Is that right?

01:11:42.849 --> 01:11:46.016
Who's that?

01:12:03.768 --> 01:12:05.501
What the hell is this?

01:12:05.503 --> 01:12:08.103
Hermano, it's time
for us to have a talk man.

01:12:08.105 --> 01:12:10.171
Hey. Where y'all going?

01:12:10.173 --> 01:12:12.573
Look at me, just look at me.

01:12:12.575 --> 01:12:14.608
My walk, this
ain't no pimp walk.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:16.743
I got shot in the ass by
my own homie, man.

01:12:16.745 --> 01:12:18.111
My own homie shot me in the ass,

01:12:18.113 --> 01:12:20.063
friendly fire.

01:12:20.064 --> 01:12:22.014
Do you have an Abuelita?
Yeah, I know you do.

01:12:22.016 --> 01:12:25.083
What if I went to your
grandma's house and jumped

01:12:25.085 --> 01:12:27.518
her ass into my gang?
How would you feel?

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.653
How would you feel?

01:12:29.655 --> 01:12:33.023
You're a natural warrior,
a natural leader of men.

01:12:33.025 --> 01:12:35.225
And the more you realize that,

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:38.294
the less you'e gonna
kick and stab people.

01:12:38.296 --> 01:12:39.595
Why you so low, brother?

01:12:39.597 --> 01:12:41.863
You don't understand.

01:12:41.865 --> 01:12:44.866
I like kicking and stabbing.

01:12:44.868 --> 01:12:48.102
Come on, come on. Let
the healing begin, brother,

01:12:48.104 --> 01:12:49.236
let the healing begin.

01:12:49.238 --> 01:12:51.838
Let's get out of here, bro.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:13:04.549
Oh, Mina, how I miss you.
You are my everything.

01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:13.023
You're just like a flower.

01:13:13.025 --> 01:13:16.192
Whassup, fool?

01:13:16.194 --> 01:13:18.561
Cheer up, man. Your
parents will get over it.

01:13:18.563 --> 01:13:20.696
No, man, my whole
family's pissed at me.

01:13:20.698 --> 01:13:22.197
If I don't pay
back the gazebo fund,

01:13:22.199 --> 01:13:24.265
they'll never gonna
let me back in the Banda.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.567
Thought you hated
doing that shit anyway.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:31.805
No, man. I actually love it, ok.
I love the music, the outfits,

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:34.340
the girls. And now
it's all gone.

01:13:34.342 --> 01:13:36.642
So we got to get even with Lola.

01:13:36.644 --> 01:13:38.844
And get your money back.

01:13:38.846 --> 01:13:41.179
Why are you so bent
out of shape about it?

01:13:41.181 --> 01:13:43.214
I mean, we all got burned,
but you're taking it extra hard.

01:13:43.216 --> 01:13:44.815
Yeah, for real man, what's up?

01:13:44.817 --> 01:13:46.616
You guys don't get it, do you?

01:13:46.618 --> 01:13:48.150
Get what?

01:13:48.152 --> 01:13:50.719
She didn't just
cheat us out of our money.

01:13:50.721 --> 01:13:52.954
She cheated us
out of our manhood.

01:13:52.956 --> 01:13:54.022
What?

01:13:54.023 --> 01:13:55.089
She cheated me and
Joker out of our manhood.

01:13:55.091 --> 01:14:01.161
You... shut up. You, too? No.

01:14:01.163 --> 01:14:02.862
Yeah, I'm a virgin, too.

01:14:02.864 --> 01:14:04.830
Shut up, no you're not.

01:14:04.832 --> 01:14:07.933
No way. That can't be true.
What about those cheerleaders?

01:14:07.935 --> 01:14:08.900
Lies.

01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:10.268
That hoochie from La Puente?

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:11.769
Stories.

01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:14.638
Wow. You know, you
told me that one night.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.808
No, no, no. I never said I did.
I just never denied the stories.

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:20.242
Wow.

01:14:20.244 --> 01:14:21.960
Oh, Sharky.

01:14:21.961 --> 01:14:23.677
So all three of us are virgins?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.947
I guess so.

01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:30.750
But the hell if I'm gonna
let Lola get the last laugh.

01:14:30.752 --> 01:14:32.718
You still got that
girl, Mina's number?

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.286
Yeah, I actually
memorized her number before

01:14:34.288 --> 01:14:36.821
my dad took the matchbook.
She still wants to see me.

01:14:36.823 --> 01:14:38.889
All right, call her up.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.474
Ok.

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:42.058
Tell her to meet
us at my pad in one hour.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.126
I just got an idea.

01:14:44.128 --> 01:14:46.928
All right. Cool.
All right, you guys.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:51.064
So we come up the alley.
Mina, you open the back door.

01:14:51.066 --> 01:14:52.999
- Wait.
- Mina, what's this symbol right here?

01:14:53.001 --> 01:14:55.401
I drew a little booty
to represent the back door.

01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:57.302
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

01:14:57.304 --> 01:14:59.671
Now, these back
stairs are reserved for VIP.

01:14:59.673 --> 01:15:00.872
But they're usually empty.

01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:03.307
Now, they're gonna lead
all the way up to the office

01:15:03.309 --> 01:15:05.142
that's located above the club.

01:15:05.144 --> 01:15:06.910
And that's Lola's room.

01:15:06.912 --> 01:15:08.845
You mean this room
with the devil lady in it?

01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:11.280
That's funny, Mina.

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:13.181
So the
stairs do go up to the roof?

01:15:13.183 --> 01:15:15.850
Yeah. And you see
where this lipstick is?

01:15:15.852 --> 01:15:18.652
That's where the cabinet
is with the little metal box.

01:15:18.654 --> 01:15:22.155
That's where Lola stores all her
money that she steals.

01:15:22.157 --> 01:15:24.157
Don't worry, Mina.
We'll get your money back.

01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:25.992
And when my family's
gazebo is finished,

01:15:25.994 --> 01:15:28.060
you can come over and
I'll sing to you.

01:15:28.062 --> 01:15:29.795
Guys, wait a minute.
What about all those bouncers?

01:15:29.797 --> 01:15:32.697
Is there like a plan B in case
we can't get out that way?

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:37.134
Of course there is.
Trust me, Beetle. We can't lose.

01:15:37.136 --> 01:15:38.702
Famous last words, Bro.

01:15:38.704 --> 01:15:44.207
Yeah. Let's roll, Puto.

01:15:55.153 --> 01:15:57.820
Mina, it's me, Joker.

01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:11.265
Ok, the roof is that way.
Good luck, guys. Be careful.

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:14.368
Shhh.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.441
There's a lot of things I
do, I think about baseball a lot.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:27.279
I am going to Swing away,
swinging until my time is up.

01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:28.480
Oh, shit, that's the Coach.

01:16:28.482 --> 01:16:30.148
So what? Let's go.

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:33.017
Because the batter's up.
The batter is up.

01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:35.319
You can make this happen.
This is totally, I'm down and

01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:36.920
ready for you.

01:16:44.128 --> 01:16:47.496
All right. Here it is.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:55.936
Here, Joker, hold this. All
right, Beetle, get down there.

01:16:55.938 --> 01:16:58.338
What? Why do I have to go down?

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.439
Well, you're the skinniest.

01:16:59.441 --> 01:17:01.941
Go ahead, Beetle.

01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:13.217
I can't hold on, Sharky.

01:17:13.219 --> 01:17:14.885
Go, come on. You can do it.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.886
I can't.

01:17:59.797 --> 01:18:03.832
Sharky, catch.

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:08.469
Throw it higher.

01:18:08.471 --> 01:18:10.237
You throw like a girl.

01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:14.007
Come on, guys, this isn't funny.

01:18:14.009 --> 01:18:17.377
Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

01:18:46.307 --> 01:18:52.344
Robbery. Robbery. Robbery.

01:18:55.916 --> 01:18:58.983
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:20:06.618 --> 01:20:10.831
Oh, base hit!
Oh, yeah, round second.

01:20:10.857 --> 01:20:12.388
Oh. Go to third.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:19.261
I'm around third, oh. Slide.
I gotta slide. Go home.

01:20:19.263 --> 01:20:22.097
Slide! Slide! What the hell?

01:20:22.099 --> 01:20:23.465
What's up, Coach?

01:20:23.467 --> 01:20:24.966
I'm a little busy here, fellas.

01:20:24.968 --> 01:20:26.267
Yeah, looks like
she's doing all the work.

01:20:26.269 --> 01:20:28.168
Yup. You're a lazy lover, Coach.

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.336
What's the principal
gonna think about this, Coach?

01:20:30.338 --> 01:20:32.971
- Hey fellas, can't we just uh.
- Let's make a d -

01:20:32.973 --> 01:20:35.606
Let's cut the crap. Is
Sharky back on the team or what?

01:20:35.608 --> 01:20:37.107
Shark - oh, Rodriguez?

01:20:37.109 --> 01:20:39.359
Yeah.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.610
Yeah. Of course. No
hard feelings, right, buddy?

01:20:41.613 --> 01:20:43.579
Yeah. See you at practice.

01:20:43.581 --> 01:20:48.616
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now
get the hell outta the room.

01:20:48.618 --> 01:20:51.418
Make me proud, Coach.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.386
Now, where were we?

01:20:53.388 --> 01:20:54.720
Sorry, your time's up.

01:20:54.722 --> 01:20:57.756
No extra innings?
Oh, oh, foul, foul ball.

01:21:05.264 --> 01:21:07.163
We can't lose, huh?

01:21:07.165 --> 01:21:09.298
Relax, I got an
emergency back-up plan.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.434
Emergency what?
Not the Mafiosos man!

01:21:12.436 --> 01:21:16.304
Now, let's be real cool, man.
Real cool. Oh.

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:24.011
Wait. Before you handle
these idiots, I want to know.

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:27.748
You actually thought that you
could steal from Lola?

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.382
Oh, we're gonna
shut you down, Lola.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.384
Tell your goons to back off.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:37.322
Did you hear that?
Kid says he's gonna shut me down.

01:21:37.324 --> 01:21:41.025
The only thing that you're gonna
do is tell me how you got in.

01:21:41.027 --> 01:21:42.192
Who helped you?

01:21:42.194 --> 01:21:45.695
Screw you.

01:21:45.697 --> 01:21:47.129
Who helped you?

01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:48.563
We did it ourselves, Bitch.

01:21:48.565 --> 01:21:52.733
Ok, hero boy. You tell me.
Who got you in here?

01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:54.000
<i>LOUD RUMBLING.</i>

01:21:54.002 --> 01:21:56.102
What was that?

01:21:56.103 --> 01:21:58.203
Turns out, we're not
the only ones you screwed over.

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:27.332
Women of Lola's
run, you are free!

01:22:32.305 --> 01:22:36.307
Girls, we're free! Let's go!

01:22:47.218 --> 01:22:50.352
Damn, fool, you
don't even care that she used to

01:22:50.354 --> 01:22:51.720
work at Lola's, huh?

01:22:51.722 --> 01:22:54.289
No, I don't. It's just
like that movie, Pretty Woman.

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:57.458
That's crazy. What you gonna
do, you gonna pimp her out now?

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.194
Not even. I got her a job
that's gonna help her forget her past.

01:23:00.196 --> 01:23:01.796
Where at?

01:23:01.797 --> 01:23:03.397
She's a cone jockey
down at the Icee Freeze.

01:23:03.399 --> 01:23:06.299
Oh, shit, it's the cop dude. I
can't get in trouble again. Oh.

01:23:06.301 --> 01:23:08.534
Well, well, well.

01:23:08.536 --> 01:23:10.836
If it isn't Peter Rabbit
and his bunny boys.

01:23:10.838 --> 01:23:12.804
Looks like it's my lucky day.

01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:14.539
Are you gonna
kill us or arrest us?

01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:18.476
Kill ya? I want to thank you.
You guys opened my eyes.

01:23:18.478 --> 01:23:21.712
I'm getting a divorce
and couldn't be happier.

01:23:21.714 --> 01:23:24.815
As you guys know,
my wife is a slut.

01:23:24.817 --> 01:23:26.082
I knew that.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:28.551
Actually, I owe a
debt of gratitude to my

01:23:28.553 --> 01:23:29.818
friend Benjamin here.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.119
For what?

01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:32.553
Because of this young man,

01:23:32.555 --> 01:23:35.188
I was able to put a sting on
the most notorious brothel

01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:37.123
that ever poisoned the
streets of our city.

01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:38.691
Yeah, Beetle?

01:23:38.692 --> 01:23:40.258
You really shut things
up at headquarters for me, kid.

01:23:40.261 --> 01:23:41.994
Thanks.

01:23:41.995 --> 01:23:43.728
Yeah, no problem, Officer.
That means we're cool, right?

01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:47.265
Actually, I did a little
research on you, Benjamin.

01:23:47.267 --> 01:23:48.866
And I found out you weren't
born in this country.

01:23:48.868 --> 01:23:50.334
That you're actually
here illegaly.

01:23:50.336 --> 01:23:52.302
So I need you to turn around
and put your hands on your-

01:23:52.304 --> 01:23:53.303
Hey, you can't do that!

01:23:53.305 --> 01:23:55.438
That's not cool.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:01.877
You guys are rich.
Can't you take a joke? Come on.

01:24:01.879 --> 01:24:06.280
I'm not gonna arrest ya.
However, whatever happened

01:24:06.282 --> 01:24:08.682
to that bunny suit? I need it
back. You guys have that?

01:24:08.684 --> 01:24:12.118
Actually, Officer, the
bunny suit was lost in action.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.252
Oh.

01:24:13.254 --> 01:24:14.286
Yeah.

01:24:14.288 --> 01:24:15.287
Yeah, we're
really sorry about that.

01:24:15.289 --> 01:24:17.455
But I can invite you
to some party punch.

01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:18.823
My Tia's secret recipe.

01:24:18.825 --> 01:24:20.758
Nah, I think I'm gonna
have to pass on that, guys.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.626
Her secret's Tequila.

01:24:22.628 --> 01:24:25.362
You talked me into it.

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:26.730
Viola.

01:24:26.732 --> 01:24:29.532
All right. Thanks.
You guys be good.

01:24:29.534 --> 01:24:31.500
All right.

01:24:31.502 --> 01:24:32.834
What the hell?

01:24:32.836 --> 01:24:35.703
Diana. Octavio.

01:24:40.376 --> 01:24:42.909
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Damas e Caballeros,

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:50.882
welcome to our first
annual Gazebo Banda Party.

01:24:50.884 --> 01:24:58.256
Ok. Now we are
ready to Rock la casa.

01:26:22.441 --> 01:26:25.542
Hey. You made it.

01:26:25.544 --> 01:26:27.010
Yeah.

01:26:27.012 --> 01:26:28.544
How are you?

01:26:28.546 --> 01:26:30.712
What's the cop doing here?
I thought he was after you?

01:26:30.714 --> 01:26:33.281
Felicia, there's something
I have to explain to you.

01:26:33.283 --> 01:26:35.716
I used to think that losing
my virginity would make me a

01:26:35.718 --> 01:26:37.517
man, but I know it's stupid.

01:26:37.519 --> 01:26:40.887
And trying to get laid,
acting like a big shot

01:26:40.889 --> 01:26:42.955
doesn't make you
man, it makes you a jerk.

01:26:42.957 --> 01:26:45.691
So, what are you saying?

01:26:45.693 --> 01:26:48.560
I'm saying that I, I don't
know if I'm ready to be a man.

01:26:48.562 --> 01:26:51.996
But I really want to
be your boyfriend.

01:26:51.998 --> 01:27:00.737
Wow. That actually sounded
pretty mature, Beetle.

01:27:00.739 --> 01:27:02.772
But a deal is not a deal unless
it's sealed with a kiss.
