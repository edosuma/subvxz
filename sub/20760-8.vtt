WEBVTT

00:00.147 --> 00:01.512
Previously, on "12 Monkeys"...

00:01.537 --> 00:02.709
You lied to me.

00:02.733 --> 00:04.528
The Witness can be saved.

00:04.553 --> 00:05.615
Take her down.

00:07.663 --> 00:10.697
The boy is my charge, not the man.

00:10.799 --> 00:13.241
- We're done playing games.
- You ready to talk?

00:13.265 --> 00:15.201
I can tell you how to kill the Witness.

00:15.304 --> 00:18.305
They've come for me,
Father, Mother, too.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.640
You can't have him.

00:23.532 --> 00:24.388
It needn't be like this.

00:26.181 --> 00:27.981
Athan.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.825
- Cole?
- He's my son.

00:32.186 --> 00:33.153
No!

00:33.255 --> 00:34.454
We can't go back.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.755
Jones knows... She'll kill us.

00:35.857 --> 00:37.357
We're on our own now.

00:37.459 --> 00:39.793
You do know what we have to do, right?

00:39.903 --> 00:41.269
Yes.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.260
Hold still.

01:23.642 --> 01:25.242
How did this happen?

01:25.344 --> 01:26.367
On the docks.

01:26.484 --> 01:29.846
Bastard foreman shoved
me into a broken crate.

01:31.116 --> 01:31.948
Will I lose it?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.584
No, I can clean this.

01:34.686 --> 01:37.487
Some of the men...
They wagered I'd lose it

01:37.589 --> 01:39.022
before the month's up.

01:39.124 --> 01:41.291
Fortunately, you received a tetanus shot

01:41.393 --> 01:44.206
when we were in 1987.

01:45.597 --> 01:48.532
Hand will heal.

01:48.634 --> 01:50.534
They'll ask questions.

01:50.636 --> 01:53.236
Tell them you were lucky.

01:53.338 --> 01:55.772
Tell them you prayed.

02:01.313 --> 02:02.779
Why not return, Sebastian,

02:02.881 --> 02:07.317
to 1987, 1930, 1976,

02:07.419 --> 02:10.387
anywhere, any-when but here?

02:10.489 --> 02:12.088
They'll find us.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.423
They have ways.

02:13.525 --> 02:14.724
Our movements are not untraceable.

02:15.535 --> 02:16.927
Then let them find us.

02:17.029 --> 02:19.796
It would be better
than living in squalor.

02:20.999 --> 02:25.101
Athan, one day, you will have
all the power in the world.

02:25.203 --> 02:27.437
Only a man who has learned
to live with nothing

02:27.539 --> 02:31.808
can understand what
wielding that actually means.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.789
You have visions?

02:49.595 --> 02:51.227
I can't stop them.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.767
No more voices, no more variables.

02:58.870 --> 03:02.372
To be Primary is beautiful.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.441
You're part of nature.

03:04.543 --> 03:06.776
Part of time itself.

03:08.180 --> 03:11.247
No, no, I've begun to see my future,

03:11.350 --> 03:15.307
and it is masked by darkness.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.787
It's shrouded.

03:22.728 --> 03:24.060
Here.

03:31.303 --> 03:35.872
I've always said your
future is your own.

03:35.974 --> 03:37.807
This is a gift.

03:40.479 --> 03:42.512
Sebastian, this is insanity.

03:42.614 --> 03:44.814
Then make it sane.

04:14.179 --> 04:17.079
- Serpent... tail.
- The serpent eats its tail.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.190
Hey.

05:34.198 --> 05:35.097
Didn't you hear?

05:35.105 --> 05:36.305
War's over.

05:36.321 --> 05:37.487
Nothing back that way.

05:37.863 --> 05:40.363
There's nothing here either.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.433
I don't understand...
This is what she saw.

05:43.535 --> 05:46.436
This train, this time.

05:46.538 --> 05:47.637
What are you doing?

05:47.739 --> 05:49.239
It's V-Day.

05:49.341 --> 05:51.941
Great Granddad spent it
face-down in Normandy,

05:52.043 --> 05:54.811
so this is for him.

06:20.305 --> 06:22.839
Ah, shit.

06:34.753 --> 06:36.452
Come on.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.526
Stop following us.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.760
We're not even chasing them.

07:57.073 --> 08:00.349
It's like we're following
them from the front.

08:00.374 --> 08:02.441
Right place, right
time. Wrong direction.

08:02.543 --> 08:04.376
And, with those suits,
they're getting better,

08:04.478 --> 08:08.347
faster, quicker jumps,
shorter distances.

08:10.451 --> 08:13.485
Cross reference these
historical notations again

08:13.588 --> 08:15.654
against the feedback of the suit.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.723
All the feedback has been accounted for.

08:17.825 --> 08:21.093
We have no new readings
that match anything on here.

08:21.195 --> 08:22.561
We must have missed something.

08:22.663 --> 08:24.196
By the time we start the fight,

08:24.298 --> 08:27.066
we have already fought and lost.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.767
It shouldn't even be a fight.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.302
They're our friends.

08:30.404 --> 08:33.672
Oh, yeah, they're real friendly.

08:35.842 --> 08:38.682
And your directions are for shit.

08:43.183 --> 08:44.750
I can only draw what I see.

08:44.852 --> 08:48.220
Places, pieces, moments.

08:48.322 --> 08:50.856
Is that it?

08:50.958 --> 08:53.592
Seems like your third
eye's getting a little lazy.

08:53.694 --> 08:56.462
Everything Ms. Goines has
seen corresponds to an item

08:56.564 --> 08:58.430
on the Witness' map.

08:58.492 --> 09:01.867
Yes, the suits provide
them with an advantage,

09:01.969 --> 09:03.736
but they also come with a tell.

09:03.838 --> 09:08.874
Here, Hong Kong, 1924,
Moscow, 1993, Chile,

09:08.976 --> 09:13.212
Morocco, London, 1899, 1940.

09:13.314 --> 09:15.714
When we studied the
suit's navigation system,

09:15.816 --> 09:18.784
we also acquired its temporal signature.

09:18.886 --> 09:21.654
Like a GPS or a temporal IP address,

09:21.756 --> 09:24.890
traceable within certain parameters.

09:24.992 --> 09:27.459
The map gives us the
why, Ms. Goines the where,

09:27.561 --> 09:29.295
and the suits the when.

09:29.397 --> 09:30.963
None of it's any good
if we can't get there

09:31.065 --> 09:32.464
before them.

09:32.566 --> 09:35.367
So what do we do?

09:35.469 --> 09:37.303
I need some fresh eyes on this.

09:40.942 --> 09:43.475
A set of footprints that stop suddenly.

09:43.577 --> 09:46.312
Is this some kind of religious metaphor?

09:46.414 --> 09:48.180
Spirituality?

09:48.282 --> 09:50.416
Hmm, interesting.

09:50.518 --> 09:53.319
I see you have enjoyed your library.

09:53.421 --> 09:56.588
Yes, thank you for the books.

09:56.691 --> 10:01.794
Self-help, enlightenment,
the power of crystals.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.163
What you did to me with
the machine was more humane.

10:04.265 --> 10:07.499
Unfortunately, this image
represents quite literally

10:07.602 --> 10:10.670
where we are with stopping
Mr. Cole and Dr. Railly.

10:10.771 --> 10:12.972
It's a dead end.

10:13.074 --> 10:20.045
You learn a great many things
in cycles, boxes... cages.

10:21.248 --> 10:23.764
Patience. You'll find them.

10:24.685 --> 10:27.486
I'm afraid patience
is not my strong suit.

10:27.588 --> 10:30.155
Too conscious of the ticking clock.

10:30.257 --> 10:31.961
Obviously.

10:32.379 --> 10:34.742
Imagine for a moment

10:36.665 --> 10:38.231
you were me.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.200
What would you do?

10:40.302 --> 10:42.269
Quit smoking.

10:46.575 --> 10:49.509
And then?

10:49.611 --> 10:52.913
James and Dr. Railly
are tracking their son,

10:53.015 --> 10:56.116
which means they're
learning to think like him.

10:56.218 --> 10:57.851
There are no straight lines.

10:57.953 --> 10:59.390
The Witness knows this.

11:00.289 --> 11:02.155
So stop thinking linearly.

11:08.564 --> 11:10.592
Take her out of this thing.

11:15.003 --> 11:16.770
What is she doing?

11:16.872 --> 11:17.904
Whatever it takes.

11:18.006 --> 11:19.606
This is wrong.

11:19.708 --> 11:22.242
When are you gonna realize
that there is no right?

11:22.344 --> 11:23.563
What happened to you?

11:23.712 --> 11:26.479
Bullets, care of Dr. Railly.

11:26.582 --> 11:29.583
And the ironic thing is
I taught her how to shoot.

11:29.685 --> 11:32.452
Did you also teach her how
to miss every vital organ?

11:32.554 --> 11:35.155
Because she did... on purpose.

11:35.257 --> 11:37.157
What a sweetheart.

11:37.259 --> 11:41.294
And James, he led us into
that shit, made us all targets,

11:41.396 --> 11:45.098
then he sees his boy,
has a change of heart.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.802
Sometimes happens to people
who have done horrible things.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.304
- Don't.
- They look for redemption

11:51.406 --> 11:53.607
from the people they've killed.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.743
You know who killed Old You that day?

11:56.845 --> 11:58.445
The Family Cole.

11:58.547 --> 12:00.580
And the chaos of their
mad son's red forest.

12:00.682 --> 12:02.949
But they're hoping
that people can change,

12:03.051 --> 12:05.385
that they can save his soul.

12:05.487 --> 12:07.220
I know they can't.

12:07.322 --> 12:09.422
Because I used to blame myself
for what happened that day.

12:09.524 --> 12:15.128
I probably should, but... I'm over it.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.297
Way over it.

12:19.368 --> 12:21.401
Mr. Deacon.

12:39.995 --> 12:43.857
Come on, tell me where you are.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.428
Five and three, blue and green.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.167
Give me yellow... I
could paint you the world.

13:00.442 --> 13:01.741
The Guardians?

13:01.843 --> 13:04.678
You've encountered no resistance?

13:04.780 --> 13:06.476
Three are dead.

13:07.616 --> 13:09.916
Really?

13:10.018 --> 13:11.351
Still one more.

13:11.453 --> 13:13.720
Who did not reset time when he left.

13:13.822 --> 13:15.722
Still, the Witness is vulnerable.

13:15.824 --> 13:18.692
To James and Dr.
Railly, but also to you.

13:18.794 --> 13:20.727
Have you been able to
track where they've been?

13:20.829 --> 13:23.563
Well, at first, there
was a rush of activity.

13:23.665 --> 13:26.032
We encountered them at
each one of these points,

13:26.134 --> 13:29.302
but, as far as we can tell,
the Word of the Witness

13:29.404 --> 13:32.939
does not reference any
other specific event.

13:37.279 --> 13:40.914
Footprints vanishing.

13:43.051 --> 13:45.051
Redirecting.

13:50.659 --> 13:53.226
This image doesn't depict a dead end.

13:53.328 --> 13:57.030
Only a change of course.

13:57.132 --> 13:59.199
They're returning to
the places they've been.

13:59.301 --> 14:00.533
Tracing their steps.

14:00.635 --> 14:02.569
Using your own altercations as decoys.

14:02.671 --> 14:06.473
You'll find them in one of
these previous time periods.

14:06.575 --> 14:08.708
Something else you've
been wrong about too.

14:08.810 --> 14:12.145
The Witness doesn't have one
Guardian left protecting him.

14:14.449 --> 14:15.915
He has two.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.007
Primaries don't think linearly.

14:41.109 --> 14:42.609
Like the Witness.

14:42.711 --> 14:44.362
Jennifer knows this.

14:45.213 --> 14:46.913
She's been leading you astray.

14:49.918 --> 14:52.875
London, 1899.

14:54.089 --> 14:55.588
You're still there.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.224
She's protecting them.

14:58.326 --> 15:00.126
Protecting the Witness.

15:04.766 --> 15:06.833
I have to help Cole and Cassie, okay?

15:06.935 --> 15:09.369
You're my only hope. I'm so sorry.

15:09.471 --> 15:12.038
I'm so, so sorry.

15:17.512 --> 15:18.928
What's going on?

15:24.019 --> 15:26.653
Temporal radiation.

15:26.755 --> 15:28.354
The levels are climbing.

15:28.457 --> 15:30.090
They're off the scales.

15:32.194 --> 15:33.660
Shut down the machine.

15:33.762 --> 15:37.030
It's not coming from the machine.

15:37.132 --> 15:38.465
Jennifer.

15:47.943 --> 15:48.975
Run!

15:54.149 --> 15:55.949
The hell is happening?

15:56.051 --> 16:01.121
Lasky, Lasky, time for
some real talk, me and you.

16:01.223 --> 16:03.223
Yea or nay?

16:03.325 --> 16:04.557
Nay.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.593
Killing our friends?

16:08.396 --> 16:10.029
Nay.

16:10.132 --> 16:11.865
Big nay.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.433
Super nay.

16:13.535 --> 16:15.969
What the hell was that?

16:17.405 --> 16:19.272
The machine!

16:21.209 --> 16:22.242
I gotta go.

16:22.344 --> 16:23.910
London 1899.

16:24.003 --> 16:26.668
You have the coordinates
already, just send me back.

16:26.690 --> 16:28.160
They're gonna kill Cole
and Cassie if I don't

16:28.214 --> 16:29.050
get to them first.

16:29.082 --> 16:30.183
Jones will kill me!

16:30.285 --> 16:32.785
Please.

16:32.888 --> 16:35.555
I would have to be at gunpoint.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.659
- Like this?
- Chk-chk.

16:39.761 --> 16:43.296
Oh, no, I fear for my life.

17:01.883 --> 17:06.685
Sorry, Jones, she had a gun.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.626
Wanna tell me where we're going?

17:18.681 --> 17:20.548
This way, down this street.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.002
This is our last lead.
After this, we got nothing.

17:23.104 --> 17:25.471
The Word of the Witness
said, "London, 1899."

17:25.574 --> 17:27.173
"The Red Death, Twopence for a Pauper."

17:27.275 --> 17:28.775
I still don't get it.

17:28.877 --> 17:30.276
Twopence just means two pennies.

17:30.378 --> 17:33.379
A pauper is a poor
person, and the red death

17:33.481 --> 17:36.591
is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe.

17:37.452 --> 17:38.551
Wanna help me out?

17:38.653 --> 17:39.819
I grew up in the apocalypse.

17:39.921 --> 17:41.855
My family didn't own a bookstore.

17:41.957 --> 17:44.123
Poe wrote "The Masque of the Red Death."

17:44.226 --> 17:46.326
My grandfather used to
read Poe to me as a kid.

17:46.428 --> 17:47.961
It was scary.

17:48.063 --> 17:50.263
Poe's "Red Death" was about a plague,

17:50.365 --> 17:53.099
but his plague was fictional.

17:53.201 --> 17:56.769
So red forest, red
death, plagues, masks.

17:56.872 --> 17:58.304
Why London, why now?

17:58.406 --> 18:02.210
London fought the Great
Plague starting in 1665.

18:02.257 --> 18:03.409
There have been
outbreaks ever since, but,

18:03.511 --> 18:05.745
historically speaking,
here, now, there's nothing.

18:05.847 --> 18:07.447
Except...

18:07.549 --> 18:09.015
I found this.

18:15.957 --> 18:17.290
A party?

18:17.392 --> 18:18.725
A ball.

18:18.827 --> 18:21.427
"Exquisite dining,
dancing, and music for those

18:21.529 --> 18:23.963
of particular heritage and means."

18:24.065 --> 18:26.132
Who'd celebrate a plague?

18:26.234 --> 18:28.301
There's nothing rich
people like celebrating more

18:28.403 --> 18:30.837
than their own privilege and survival.

18:30.939 --> 18:34.140
Sick is only sick if it
happens to rich people.

18:34.242 --> 18:35.975
Sounds familiar.

18:36.077 --> 18:39.612
"Red Death, Twopence for a Pauper."

18:39.714 --> 18:42.882
I think this party is what
Athan was talking about.

18:42.984 --> 18:44.484
He could be there.

18:44.586 --> 18:47.487
Cassie, if we're wrong,
and he's not, this could be

18:47.589 --> 18:50.523
our last chance at 1899.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.927
Excuse me, sir, madam,
can I bother you for...?

18:54.029 --> 18:55.662
Hey, hey, whoa.

18:55.764 --> 18:57.230
Nice try, kid.

18:57.332 --> 18:59.098
Your brother's got the
distraction part down,

18:59.200 --> 19:03.136
but you... you gotta lift and then pull.

19:06.007 --> 19:07.507
Here.

19:10.712 --> 19:12.946
Go get something to eat.

19:14.049 --> 19:15.715
Come on, get out of here.

19:17.919 --> 19:20.219
Scavs in every century.

19:21.389 --> 19:24.991
You're sweet, but, unless
you like sweeping chimneys,

19:25.093 --> 19:27.293
I'd save what little
money you have left.

19:27.395 --> 19:29.529
If we're gonna try to con
our way into this party,

19:29.631 --> 19:33.032
we need to look like we belong,
and we don't have nearly enough.

19:33.134 --> 19:36.135
- We'll get it.
- How?

19:36.237 --> 19:38.171
Like scavs.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.183
What is this, madam?

19:50.285 --> 19:52.085
Shit, sorry.

19:55.390 --> 19:59.492
Okay, uh, we should
rethink your approach.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.197
I can't do this.

20:04.299 --> 20:05.965
Yes, yes you can.

20:06.067 --> 20:10.336
Just smaller moves, bigger smile.

20:10.772 --> 20:11.704
Mm?

20:16.277 --> 20:19.312
We need costumes, good ones.

20:19.414 --> 20:22.081
We're gonna have to pick more pockets.

20:22.183 --> 20:25.485
- Okay.
- There's something else.

20:27.155 --> 20:28.688
What?

20:28.790 --> 20:30.890
One, two, three.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.492
One, two, three.

20:32.594 --> 20:34.060
It's okay... I have nine more.

20:34.162 --> 20:35.728
Two three.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.764
- One, two, three.
- One... Yeah, I know that part.

20:37.866 --> 20:39.018
You're more coordinated than this.

20:39.127 --> 20:40.767
I can't see my feet. I
don't know what I'm doing.

20:40.853 --> 20:41.493
How do you walk?

20:41.549 --> 20:42.486
Do you walk staring at your feet?

20:42.540 --> 20:43.313
Okay... I'm...

20:43.360 --> 20:45.751
Down, one... wow,
you're really bouncing.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.440
- You said, "up, down."
- I know, I did.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.142
- One, two...
- What are you...?

20:49.244 --> 20:50.576
- I'm not laughing at you.
- Don't laugh.

20:50.678 --> 20:52.738
You said, "up, down!"

20:53.231 --> 20:55.302
- Okay, let's start again.
- Two, three.

20:55.373 --> 20:57.471
- It's not a polka.
- You're counting out a rhythm.

20:57.477 --> 20:58.718
- One, two.
- You said... no, please...

20:58.820 --> 20:59.952
- You...
- One, two, three.

21:00.055 --> 21:01.721
Or one... two, three.

21:01.823 --> 21:04.057
Are you okay? Your
face is really twisted.

21:04.159 --> 21:06.059
Imagine you're balancing
a glass of water.

21:06.161 --> 21:07.927
- While you're doing one,
- Okay.

21:08.029 --> 21:09.796
two, three, the water
would be all over the place.

21:09.898 --> 21:11.864
Here we go, one more time. One, two...

21:11.966 --> 21:14.133
- Ah, all right.
- Oh, my God.

21:14.235 --> 21:17.236
Explain to me again
why we have to do this.

21:17.338 --> 21:20.039
Because, if I'm posing as
a wealthy American heiress,

21:20.141 --> 21:24.644
I wouldn't be caught dead
with some uncultured Yankee.

21:24.746 --> 21:25.912
What's wrong with Yankees?

21:26.014 --> 21:27.780
I'm doing the best I can. Come on.

21:27.882 --> 21:28.981
So delicate.

21:29.084 --> 21:31.684
One, two, three, keep going.

21:31.786 --> 21:33.786
One, two, three.

21:33.888 --> 21:36.155
Excuse me, sir, do you
know where Kensington is?

21:36.257 --> 21:39.559
- Is it that way?
- No, it's south.

21:39.661 --> 21:42.618
Are you quite certain? I could've sworn

21:42.625 --> 21:44.009
- it was that way.
- Really?

21:44.041 --> 21:47.997
- Um, no, Kensington's...
- I'm certain I'll find it

21:48.090 --> 21:49.423
Thank you very much.

21:52.874 --> 21:55.174
One, two, three.

21:55.276 --> 21:57.710
One, two, three.

21:57.812 --> 22:00.780
One... there you go. Getting there.

22:00.882 --> 22:04.383
Yes, I am. Two...

22:04.486 --> 22:06.119
One, two, three.

22:06.221 --> 22:07.720
- Very good.
- I'm a natural.

22:07.822 --> 22:08.955
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

22:09.057 --> 22:10.556
You don't think so?

22:10.658 --> 22:12.558
Watch this.

22:14.796 --> 22:17.697
Oh, this is horrible.

22:17.799 --> 22:20.700
I'm a cultured Yankee.

22:29.110 --> 22:32.445
Nothing bad could come from this.

22:49.397 --> 22:51.564
Maybe we should take these with us.

22:52.219 --> 22:54.016
How? There's barely room

22:54.055 --> 22:56.202
to breathe in this, let
alone wear a splinter vest.

23:00.675 --> 23:02.208
We can sneak in over there.

23:02.310 --> 23:07.413
Actually, I was thinking
we could make an entrance.

23:24.566 --> 23:26.165
Ya!

23:45.787 --> 23:48.621
Our son is here somewhere.

24:11.649 --> 24:12.938
How the hell are we
supposed to recognize him?

24:12.977 --> 24:14.710
We don't know anything about him.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.741
Christ, it could be
him throwing this party.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.312
No, this isn't him.

24:20.994 --> 24:22.193
How do you know?

24:22.624 --> 24:24.691
I just do.

24:30.065 --> 24:32.757
He could be any age, young, old.

24:33.936 --> 24:36.102
What's the red death
supposed to look like anyway?

24:37.539 --> 24:39.439
A red skull.

24:47.816 --> 24:50.784
They're everywhere.

24:59.394 --> 25:02.329
All right, let's start working the room.

25:02.431 --> 25:03.671
And if we find him?

25:04.533 --> 25:05.699
Talk to him.

25:05.801 --> 25:07.100
Tell him what?

25:07.202 --> 25:11.238
The truth. Who we are, why we're here.

25:12.055 --> 25:13.855
What if it doesn't work?

25:19.481 --> 25:21.748
Okay.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.617
Let's start with the dance floor.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.928
Maybe it's not him we're
supposed to be looking for.

25:35.030 --> 25:38.531
"The Red Death," that's
here. That's the place.

25:38.634 --> 25:42.569
- But the person...
- The Pauper.

25:42.671 --> 25:47.540
Whoever that is, that's who
Athan thought was important.

25:47.643 --> 25:49.876
But look around.

25:49.978 --> 25:53.573
Bankers, industrialists, royalty.

25:55.017 --> 25:56.616
No paupers here.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.972
You're wrong. You're
looking at the masks,

26:02.017 --> 26:03.650
not the faces.

26:05.460 --> 26:09.329
- The servants.
- Could be one of them.

26:37.853 --> 26:41.494
Cole, him.

26:44.032 --> 26:45.965
Please, James, the boy
needn't become the man.

26:46.068 --> 26:47.834
He doesn't want to.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.843
Go.

27:03.885 --> 27:05.952
You.

27:06.054 --> 27:08.455
You were one of his guardians.

27:10.258 --> 27:12.859
Of all the encounters I
was hoping for tonight,

27:12.961 --> 27:14.267
this is not one of them.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.730
We were hoping to find our son.

27:16.832 --> 27:21.234
Well, such is the great
irony of our meeting.

27:21.336 --> 27:24.003
- So am I.
- Is he here?

27:24.106 --> 27:26.940
Waited almost 20 years to find out.

27:29.077 --> 27:30.543
You're coming with us.

27:30.645 --> 27:32.545
Come on.

27:35.684 --> 27:38.385
Hello, chuckaboo.

27:41.623 --> 27:43.757
Don't.

28:03.745 --> 28:06.946
How fortunate that you've
chosen such festive attire.

28:09.317 --> 28:13.086
Come now, Mr. Cole, let's
maintain our composure.

28:13.188 --> 28:16.356
Neither of us wants
to frighten the quarry.

28:18.026 --> 28:19.526
Shall we?

28:24.699 --> 28:26.132
Let's step back.

28:26.234 --> 28:28.168
Yeah, we wouldn't want
your baby boy to know

28:28.270 --> 28:30.470
that we crashed his party.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.660
Who else is with you?

28:33.847 --> 28:36.129
Already plotting your escape?

28:38.380 --> 28:42.749
Press against me, and you'll
feel the weight of a .38.

28:56.131 --> 28:59.723
Deacon, I was just trying to protect...

28:59.756 --> 29:02.156
Your son?

29:02.471 --> 29:04.637
The last person with
that reasoning wound up

29:04.739 --> 29:06.606
with a bullet from his brother.

29:09.392 --> 29:11.960
Helluva family you got there.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.315
I'm sorry.

29:15.417 --> 29:19.486
From now on, apologies
are issued in blood.

29:21.265 --> 29:24.366
So is he here?

29:24.726 --> 29:27.093
The Witness?

29:27.195 --> 29:28.928
How should I know?

29:29.030 --> 29:32.031
I'm sure you got here using
the same information we did.

29:32.133 --> 29:35.535
Once we learned not to trust Ms. Goines.

29:35.637 --> 29:39.672
Yes, madness has picked a side.

29:39.774 --> 29:43.076
Is that was this is? War?

29:43.178 --> 29:45.378
Hasn't it always been?

29:45.480 --> 29:50.250
Such devotion for one murderous child.

29:50.352 --> 29:52.585
You see a murderer.

29:52.687 --> 29:54.854
I see a scared little boy
with his mother's eyes.

29:54.956 --> 29:56.289
You're going to fail.

29:56.391 --> 29:59.659
And you know that's not how this works.

29:59.761 --> 30:01.961
Things can change.

30:02.063 --> 30:04.797
People can change.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.635
New beginnings have only
ever led us to old enemies.

30:11.706 --> 30:16.776
I have known in my
life two great agonies.

30:16.878 --> 30:19.124
The pain of losing a child

30:20.415 --> 30:23.816
and the pain of being betrayed by one.

30:24.986 --> 30:28.588
Didn't it ever occur to
you to tell me the truth?

30:29.403 --> 30:32.125
It wouldn't have made a difference.

30:33.461 --> 30:35.232
It would have torn everyone apart.

30:36.131 --> 30:37.530
And my son would be dead.

30:37.632 --> 30:39.933
Your son.

30:40.035 --> 30:43.827
My daughter never had the
chance to be better than she is.

30:45.173 --> 30:46.873
And neither did you.

30:46.975 --> 30:52.845
But your son, whatever,
wherever he is, here now...

30:54.416 --> 30:58.885
He chose a lesser life for all children,

30:58.987 --> 31:04.123
and that is why, James,
he deserves to die.

31:06.227 --> 31:07.360
Cassie and I haven't
done anything that you

31:07.462 --> 31:09.162
wouldn't have done yourself.

31:09.264 --> 31:13.166
Ah, yes, "The right
thing, the wrong way."

31:13.268 --> 31:17.170
So says the man who shot
his own brother in the back.

31:55.510 --> 31:58.144
This is the part where you run!

32:05.920 --> 32:07.587
Cole!

32:31.446 --> 32:34.947
Stop them, whatever it takes.

32:49.363 --> 32:50.983
Jonesy.

32:51.008 --> 32:52.774
I mean, it's funny how we keep swinging

32:52.876 --> 32:55.944
back and forth, back and
forth, back and forth,

32:56.046 --> 32:58.013
like a granddaddy clock...

32:59.283 --> 33:00.549
This is not a game.

33:03.687 --> 33:07.188
I'm offering you one last chance.

33:07.291 --> 33:08.790
How do we gain the upper hand?

33:08.892 --> 33:12.527
Ve haf vays of making you talk.

33:12.629 --> 33:14.095
I'm afraid you're too late.

33:14.197 --> 33:16.870
I haven't seen your
son for almost 20 years.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.533
You're his guardian.

33:18.635 --> 33:20.702
Well, he no longer wished for one.

33:28.579 --> 33:30.712
Listen, there's a lot of shit written

33:30.814 --> 33:33.248
on the Word of the Witness,
Things you taught him to write.

33:33.350 --> 33:37.953
I taught a child
language, art, mathematics.

33:38.055 --> 33:39.554
The man is his own teacher now.

33:39.656 --> 33:41.389
He's gonna destroy the world.

33:41.491 --> 33:44.326
It was my charge to show him
the world and let him decide

33:44.428 --> 33:46.227
what to do with it when he returns.

33:46.330 --> 33:47.862
To Titan.

33:47.965 --> 33:50.031
Lead the faithful to salvation,

33:50.133 --> 33:53.401
a world without death, without time.

33:53.503 --> 33:54.502
Unstoppable.

33:54.605 --> 33:56.038
You're wrong.

33:57.407 --> 33:59.074
He can choose his own fate.

34:01.645 --> 34:03.578
He didn't want his future.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.113
He despised it.

34:05.215 --> 34:07.849
He wanted a destiny that was his own.

34:09.252 --> 34:13.989
You should know that your
son wasn't just Primary.

34:14.091 --> 34:16.024
He was kind.

34:19.295 --> 34:21.529
Cassie!

34:21.632 --> 34:24.466
Cole!

34:37.280 --> 34:40.681
Mother, her drawing, the statue!

34:42.585 --> 34:44.284
Mother!

34:46.489 --> 34:48.723
Take her back to 2046.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.425
What happened between you two?

34:50.527 --> 34:53.460
20 years ago, I attempted
to alter our coordinates

34:53.563 --> 34:54.963
and return us to Titan.

34:55.065 --> 34:57.632
I thought he was ready, a good man.

34:57.734 --> 35:03.071
Imagine a benevolent Witness
with all the power of time.

35:03.173 --> 35:05.173
But he felt betrayed, and
so he stranded me here,

35:05.275 --> 35:08.576
and only years later did
I discover where he'd been.

35:08.679 --> 35:11.446
So our friendship ended that day.

35:11.548 --> 35:13.648
How often we must defy our friends

35:13.750 --> 35:15.639
for what we believe in.

35:19.723 --> 35:21.723
Why the red death?

35:21.825 --> 35:24.993
Why reference this
moment if he's not here?

35:29.219 --> 35:30.946
_

35:31.702 --> 35:34.369
Twopence.

35:34.471 --> 35:36.438
Twopence over the eyes.

35:39.042 --> 35:41.443
1919 Islington. It's an address.

35:41.545 --> 35:43.411
Go there. You will find the answers

35:43.513 --> 35:45.247
that you seek, as I did.

35:45.395 --> 35:49.150
James, it's over.

35:49.252 --> 35:54.322
I'm willing to grant you
clemency this one time.

35:54.424 --> 35:57.392
Does this man know where your son is?

35:57.494 --> 36:00.061
Katarina Jones.

36:02.499 --> 36:04.609
Do you intend on killing him?

36:05.669 --> 36:08.002
That is my only intent.

36:09.439 --> 36:12.006
I failed to stop your son.

36:13.310 --> 36:14.709
It's up to you now.

36:17.881 --> 36:19.575
"Twopence for a Pauper."

36:36.685 --> 36:38.700
No, no!

36:39.586 --> 36:41.319
Please, please, please, no!

36:41.423 --> 36:45.258
No, no, not here. No!

36:45.360 --> 36:47.460
This isn't for me!
This is for her, please!

36:47.562 --> 36:50.897
Deacon, please, please, no.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.565
No, please, no!

36:56.179 --> 36:58.245
Deacon, please.

36:58.348 --> 37:00.748
No, no, please, please, please.

37:37.286 --> 37:38.219
Shh.

37:41.190 --> 37:42.923
I know what it's like.

37:43.026 --> 37:45.893
You're locked up with nothing
but the voices in your head

37:45.995 --> 37:47.995
to keep you company.

37:53.369 --> 37:55.603
To pass the time.

37:56.973 --> 37:59.273
Sorry I can't stay.

38:02.512 --> 38:04.178
There's work to finish.

38:54.297 --> 38:56.297
Our son lived here.

39:31.651 --> 39:33.801
Cassie.

40:01.731 --> 40:06.367
We will meet again, old friend.

40:18.073 --> 40:19.606
When the forest is red.

40:23.163 --> 40:28.190
