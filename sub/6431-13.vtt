00:24.546 --> 00:27.450
Oh, just
one normal Christmas, huh?

00:27.517 --> 00:29.258
Is that too much to ask?

00:29.326 --> 00:31.361
Oh, I am having
a normal Christmas, all right?

00:31.429 --> 00:33.898
My dad is waiting for me
to decorate the tree this year,

00:33.965 --> 00:35.599
and I am not missing it.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.603
So...
All right, well,

00:37.671 --> 00:38.806
we've got plenty of time.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.774
If we just snag and bag
the schnoz--

00:41.841 --> 00:44.208
whoa!
- Pete!

00:45.443 --> 00:46.510
Oh, Myka!

00:46.578 --> 00:48.644
Whoa, whoa!

00:48.712 --> 00:50.846
Yah!
Myka!

00:53.116 --> 00:54.549
- Pete!
- I'm okay.

00:54.617 --> 00:55.450
Just get to Rudolph.

00:59.054 --> 01:01.358
On Dancer,
on Prancer...

01:01.426 --> 01:03.361
- Ow!
- On Donner and Blitzen.

01:03.428 --> 01:05.129
Ho ho ho!

01:05.197 --> 01:06.231
Ah!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.379
Ho ho ho!

01:17.446 --> 01:18.980
Merry Christmas!

01:19.048 --> 01:20.282
Ho ho ho!

01:21.786 --> 01:23.788
Hey!

01:23.856 --> 01:26.491
- I got it!
- Would you bag it?

01:26.559 --> 01:27.660
This kid's got a mean streak.

01:27.728 --> 01:28.928
Hey!
That's my tennis elbow.

Come back, Bucky!

01:47.347 --> 01:49.014
Catie!

01:49.082 --> 01:50.248
Don't go out there.

01:50.316 --> 01:53.251
- Catie!
- Bucky!

01:53.319 --> 01:54.519
Go inside, Bucky.

01:54.586 --> 01:56.120
Catie.

01:56.188 --> 01:57.222
Catie, be careful.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.424
Watch out for--

01:58.491 --> 01:59.525
oh.
- Hey.

01:59.592 --> 02:00.826
What the heck was that?

02:00.894 --> 02:01.994
All we did
was plug it in.

02:02.062 --> 02:04.565
Yeah, we're
from Florida Power.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.367
We tracked a surge
to this address.

02:06.435 --> 02:07.869
Yes, you had too many lights.

02:07.936 --> 02:09.404
One too many
to be exact.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.507
But there was a reindeer,
a live reindeer,

02:11.575 --> 02:12.541
in my kitchen.

02:12.609 --> 02:13.743
Escaped.

02:13.810 --> 02:15.911
It escaped
from the Christmas pageant

02:15.979 --> 02:17.946
at the zoo.
- The zoo had a pageant?

02:18.014 --> 02:19.415
Well, it was invitation-only.

02:20.751 --> 02:23.152
Oh, hello down there.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.787
Do you work
for Santa?

02:24.855 --> 02:27.156
I do.
I work in customer relations.

02:27.223 --> 02:28.924
Thank you
for saving Bucky.

02:28.992 --> 02:31.526
Oh, you're welcome, Catie.

02:31.594 --> 02:34.062
You know what,
Santa loves candy canes.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.698
And so do I.

02:36.765 --> 02:40.703
Thank you.

02:40.770 --> 02:43.272
Chillax, grumpy.

02:43.340 --> 02:44.907
It's just
an early Christmas present.

02:44.975 --> 02:46.242
- No!
- Artie.

02:46.310 --> 02:47.611
I'm not going to allow you

02:47.679 --> 02:49.079
to go to Vegas
with Dr. Vanessa

02:49.147 --> 02:51.215
wearing your usual symphony
in brown.

02:51.283 --> 02:52.951
Brown is slimming.
I like brown.

02:53.018 --> 02:54.719
And if I wear that in Vegas,
they'll think I'm a croupier.

02:54.787 --> 02:56.221
And I'm not gonna go to Vegas.

02:56.289 --> 02:58.357
There's way too much
to do here.

02:58.425 --> 03:00.626
The gooery needs flushing.

03:00.694 --> 03:03.496
And I haven't cycled the
security encryption in months.

03:03.564 --> 03:04.964
- What?
- What happened?

03:05.032 --> 03:06.399
Yeah, you've been looking
forward

03:06.467 --> 03:07.834
to this thing with Vanessa
for weeks.

03:07.902 --> 03:09.837
What happened?
My father called,

03:09.905 --> 03:10.938
wanting to get together
for the holiday.

03:11.006 --> 03:12.607
Thank you for that.

03:12.675 --> 03:13.875
Then he found out about Vegas,

03:13.943 --> 03:15.510
and now he guilted me
into coming with.

03:15.578 --> 03:17.212
- Ooh.
- No, it gets worse.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.449
Ha-ha. Hugo found out
about Vegas somehow,

03:20.517 --> 03:22.184
and now he wants
to come too.

03:22.252 --> 03:23.453
Well, you can't spend
another Christmas alone

03:23.520 --> 03:24.620
in the warehouse.
No, I can't.

03:24.688 --> 03:25.922
I can go with you
to Switzerland

03:25.989 --> 03:27.757
to be with your brother Joshua.
- No, no, no.

03:27.825 --> 03:29.993
No, I'm going snowboarding
in the Alps.

03:30.061 --> 03:31.294
I'm not sitting
in a corner and listening

03:31.362 --> 03:32.462
to the two of you discuss
quantum physics.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.530
That never ends well.
Vegas!

03:33.598 --> 03:34.631
- Please. Please.
- Vegas!

03:34.699 --> 03:35.699
Shut up.
Listen, Pete, Pete,

03:35.767 --> 03:37.034
I could stay here
this year.

03:37.101 --> 03:38.335
I could go
on warehouse duty.

03:38.403 --> 03:39.703
Next year you could do it.

03:39.771 --> 03:42.339
No, no, no.

03:42.406 --> 03:44.741
I drew the short straw
fair and square, Artie.

03:44.809 --> 03:48.177
Besides, my mom and my sister
are taking a shopping spree

03:48.245 --> 03:50.813
in New York City,
and I'd rather be dragged

03:50.881 --> 03:52.415
by a truck
over broken glass.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.750
Look, Artie, don't worry.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.552
You can stay with me
and my family

03:56.620 --> 03:58.054
for Christmas.
- Ohh.

03:58.121 --> 03:59.289
That's excellent.

03:59.356 --> 04:01.090
That's great.
Thank you so much.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.027
Well, I bet that Hugo
would make sure Dr. Vanessa

04:04.095 --> 04:06.964
doesn't even miss you.

04:11.436 --> 04:13.871
Vegas, baby, Vegas!

04:13.938 --> 04:15.205
Murder is legal in Vegas,
right?

04:15.273 --> 04:17.040
Oh, my God,
I have to pack.

04:17.108 --> 04:18.942
Oh, hey, I'll see you later
at Leena's

04:19.010 --> 04:20.243
for some farewell fruitcake.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.045
I am off to the Christmas aisle.

- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:26.307 --> 05:28.174
What the hell?
How did you get in here?

05:28.242 --> 05:29.776
Me?
How did I--

05:29.844 --> 05:31.811
okay, that's very funny.

05:31.879 --> 05:33.113
Artie!
Come on out.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.380
The joke's over.

05:34.448 --> 05:35.582
Where's Artie?

05:35.649 --> 05:37.317
Arthur hasn't worked here

05:37.385 --> 05:40.488
in a very long time.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.658
MacPherson.

05:43.725 --> 05:44.759
But you're dead.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.010
I mean, this--
this is just nuts.

06:02.077 --> 06:03.411
The last time I saw you,

06:03.478 --> 06:05.012
you were nothing more
than a pile of dust

06:05.080 --> 06:07.047
in front of the Escher vault.

06:07.115 --> 06:08.682
Were I dead I should think
I'd be the first to know.

06:08.750 --> 06:09.649
He's clean, James.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.017
No I.D. either.

06:11.085 --> 06:12.185
Now how do you know
about the Escher vault?

06:12.253 --> 06:13.186
How'd you even get
in here?

06:13.254 --> 06:16.289
Ooh!

06:16.356 --> 06:17.957
You break
into a high-security facility,

06:18.025 --> 06:19.392
and you start asking us
questions?

06:19.460 --> 06:21.928
Raymond, any friend of
Arthur's is someone I want

06:21.996 --> 06:24.364
to speak with.
I don't know how you did this,

06:24.432 --> 06:25.833
but you won't get away
with it.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.701
Get away with what?
And how do you know me?

06:27.769 --> 06:30.137
- We've never met.
- Fine. Keep playing your game.

06:30.205 --> 06:32.974
I know this may sound strange
to you,

06:33.042 --> 06:34.843
but I think
you're under the influence

06:34.910 --> 06:36.811
of what we call
an artifact.

06:36.879 --> 06:39.747
Have you come into contact
with anything unusual?

06:39.815 --> 06:40.915
- Maybe a family heirloom?
- No! No!

06:40.983 --> 06:43.684
I haven't been whammied.
You have.

06:43.752 --> 06:44.985
Have you noticed
the smell of fudge

06:45.053 --> 06:47.687
when there is no fudge?

06:47.755 --> 06:50.056
If this is some kind
of a joke,

06:50.124 --> 06:52.124
I get it,
I get it, okay?

06:52.192 --> 06:54.193
It's the best holiday prank
ever.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.727
Ha ha ha ha.

06:55.795 --> 06:57.963
I mean, what, is Artie using
Harriet Tubman's thimble

06:58.031 --> 07:00.499
to turn himself
into Dr. Evil?

07:00.566 --> 07:02.367
James, we've been looking
for that thimble for years.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.336
How do you know this stuff?
How'd you break in?

07:04.404 --> 07:07.305
Look, bad cop,
I didn't break in.

07:07.373 --> 07:09.107
He did.

07:09.175 --> 07:10.842
I was coming back
from the Christmas aisle,

07:10.910 --> 07:13.245
I came into Artie's office,

07:13.312 --> 07:16.581
and found James MacPherson,
Agent-turned-killer--

07:16.649 --> 07:19.217
Killer? Do you know how many
lives this man has saved?

07:19.285 --> 07:22.086
He blew up the umbilicus
with Artie in it!

07:22.154 --> 07:25.656
He freed H.G. Wells.
She tried to blow up the world.

07:25.724 --> 07:29.393
Search for artifacts
that cause delusions like this.

07:29.461 --> 07:31.295
Raymond, take him
to Leena's and tell me--

07:31.363 --> 07:32.997
Leena.
She knows me.

07:33.064 --> 07:34.431
She'll back me up.

07:36.768 --> 07:38.702
Oh, Leena,
thank God.

07:38.770 --> 07:42.741
Would you--would you please tell
grunt number one here who I am?

07:42.808 --> 07:44.276
Who are you?

07:44.343 --> 07:46.311
Pete.

07:46.379 --> 07:49.615
It's--I'm Pete.
Remember?

07:49.682 --> 07:51.016
I have a really good aura.

07:51.084 --> 07:52.084
I'm in tune.

07:52.152 --> 07:54.387
That's so strange.

07:54.455 --> 07:56.189
You don't have an aura.

07:56.257 --> 07:58.158
What?

07:58.225 --> 07:59.459
You love my aura.

07:59.527 --> 08:02.962
You flirted with my aura.
Leena.

08:05.032 --> 08:06.900
Leena,
I would never hurt you.

08:06.967 --> 08:09.468
You know that.

08:13.006 --> 08:15.107
What does Leena say?

08:15.175 --> 08:17.143
Just like we thought.
She doesn't know him either.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.644
He's definitely dangerous.

08:18.712 --> 08:21.014
There's no record
of a Peter Lattimer anywhere.

08:21.082 --> 08:23.317
I'm not getting any hits
on his prints either.

08:23.385 --> 08:26.320
James says we better take him
to the box.

08:26.388 --> 08:27.655
All right.
Coming back.

08:27.723 --> 08:29.657
Ray, look out!

08:32.394 --> 08:33.695
Uh-uh-uh.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.929
The Leena I know
is a lot nicer to her guests.

08:35.998 --> 08:37.799
Now you drop that
and get over there.

08:37.866 --> 08:41.669
Now I have got

08:41.736 --> 08:43.038
to stop MacPherson.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.840
Ah.

08:44.907 --> 08:46.775
He thinks artifacts

08:46.842 --> 08:49.077
belong out in the world.

08:49.145 --> 08:50.245
So he sells them

08:50.312 --> 08:51.480
on the black market.

08:51.547 --> 08:53.215
And I think he's used one

08:53.282 --> 08:55.283
to whammy everybody.

08:55.351 --> 08:58.086
If you think that you can
single-handedly stop

08:58.154 --> 09:00.556
James MacPherson,
you really are insane.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.791
Never said I was gonna do it
alone.

09:08.231 --> 09:10.933
So he sells them
on the black market.

09:13.503 --> 09:15.738
Bering & Son Books.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.506
Mrs. Bering, hey.

09:17.574 --> 09:19.943
Oh, my--

09:20.010 --> 09:21.878
Thank God.
It's so good to hear your voice.

09:21.946 --> 09:23.079
It's Pete.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.581
Pete who?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.216
Uh, Pete Lattimer,

09:26.284 --> 09:27.384
Myka's partner.

09:27.452 --> 09:28.519
I didn't know
Myka had a partner.

09:28.586 --> 09:31.088
You and I met
a couple years ago.

09:31.156 --> 09:33.291
Edgar Allen Poe's pen.

09:33.359 --> 09:35.861
Is this some sort of joke?

09:35.928 --> 09:38.163
Look, could you please
just put Myka on?

09:38.231 --> 09:39.998
I know she's there
for Christmas, so...

09:40.066 --> 09:42.067
Myka hasn't been home
from DC in two years,

09:42.134 --> 09:43.168
not...

09:43.235 --> 09:44.769
Not since her father's funeral,

09:44.837 --> 09:45.937
so I'd appreciate it
if you--

09:46.005 --> 09:48.173
What? No.
Warren is alive.

09:48.241 --> 09:49.274
He's decorating the tree

09:49.342 --> 09:50.576
with Myka tonight.

09:50.643 --> 09:52.177
All right, that's enough.

09:52.245 --> 09:54.146
You picked the wrong family
to pull this on, mister.

09:54.214 --> 09:56.015
My daughter is a federal agent.

09:56.082 --> 09:57.583
So just back off.

10:14.136 --> 10:16.605
♪ Da da ♪

10:16.673 --> 10:18.140
Your agents may be pretty great

10:18.207 --> 10:19.741
at taking a bullet,
but you might want

10:19.809 --> 10:20.975
to warn 'em
about the pickpockets.

10:21.043 --> 10:24.945
Did you just admit
to a crime?

10:25.013 --> 10:27.081
You have no idea who I am,
do you?

10:27.148 --> 10:29.617
Should I?

10:29.684 --> 10:30.918
Uh, okay, okay.

10:30.985 --> 10:32.252
Um...

10:32.320 --> 10:34.121
Do the words "warehouse",

10:34.188 --> 10:35.922
"artifact",

10:35.990 --> 10:37.257
or "Univille" mean anything
to you?

10:37.325 --> 10:39.059
No, but "creepy",
"trespassing",

10:39.127 --> 10:41.128
and "federal offense" do.

10:41.195 --> 10:43.764
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh.

10:43.832 --> 10:45.432
Okay.
What if I told you

10:45.500 --> 10:47.067
that I knew you spoke
a bazillion languages,

10:47.135 --> 10:49.537
that your secret high school
crush was Kurt Smoller,

10:49.605 --> 10:52.073
and you can't watch any movie
where an animal dies?

10:52.141 --> 10:53.575
Would you hear me out then?

10:53.643 --> 10:55.711
No, I would think
you were a stalker

10:55.779 --> 10:58.413
with access to Facebook
and then I would call security.

10:58.481 --> 10:59.815
- I am your partner.
- Really?

10:59.883 --> 11:01.383
Because I think I would remember
something like that.

11:05.355 --> 11:08.323
Look, please, please,

11:08.390 --> 11:10.157
of everybody,

11:10.225 --> 11:12.526
I need you to listen to me,
okay?

11:12.594 --> 11:15.529
I mean, you have
this whole other life

11:15.597 --> 11:18.031
that nobody seems
to remember but me.

11:18.099 --> 11:21.168
Maybe you should talk
to somebody about that.

11:21.236 --> 11:22.269
Look, Mr.--
- Agent.

11:22.337 --> 11:24.105
- Agent.
- Agent Pete Lattimer.

11:24.172 --> 11:27.575
Now I've been an agent
at Warehouse 13

11:27.643 --> 11:29.377
for three years
and so have you.

11:29.445 --> 11:32.481
And to keep the world safe, we
track down dangerous artifacts

11:32.549 --> 11:33.683
and store them in a warehouse
in South Dakota.

11:36.287 --> 11:37.254
There is no reality

11:37.321 --> 11:38.388
in which I would live

11:38.456 --> 11:39.823
in South Dakota.

11:39.891 --> 11:43.226
And this--this is
a government warehouse.

11:43.294 --> 11:45.129
Well--well, sort of.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.831
It's the 13th warehouse

11:46.898 --> 11:49.000
that's ever been,
started by Alexander the Great--

11:49.068 --> 11:50.235
and you think I'm crazy,
don't you?

11:50.303 --> 11:51.903
Big time.

11:53.372 --> 11:56.208
I bet you hit
the silent alarm, didn't you?

11:56.276 --> 11:57.676
Before you
even started talking.

12:00.347 --> 12:02.281
Yeah.
That's what I would have done.

12:02.349 --> 12:04.383
- Buh-bye.
- I'll see ya.

12:04.451 --> 12:05.551
Merry Christmas.

12:07.688 --> 12:09.589
Tell me how a man
in handcuffs

12:09.657 --> 12:11.425
was able to take you
by surprise.

12:11.493 --> 12:13.227
The guy obviously
has military training.

12:13.295 --> 12:14.795
As do you.

12:14.863 --> 12:16.997
Sandra,
would you be a dear

12:17.065 --> 12:19.166
and fetch him?
- Of course, James.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.943
Here you go.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.611
You're the only woman
I know

12:32.679 --> 12:35.748
who can make me follow her
into a bar.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.084
Aagh!

12:39.152 --> 12:40.919
Okay, this is not cute,
all right?

12:40.987 --> 12:42.587
This is not funny.
I am a federal agent,

12:42.655 --> 12:45.657
and I can easily
and happily shoot you.

12:45.725 --> 12:46.758
Okay, okay.

12:46.826 --> 12:47.859
I'll make you a deal.

12:47.927 --> 12:49.595
The deal
is that you walk away,

12:49.663 --> 12:50.829
I never see you again,

12:50.897 --> 12:52.264
and you don't go to jail.

12:52.332 --> 12:54.066
Fine, fine,
just answer one question,

12:54.134 --> 12:55.201
and I'll leave you alone
forever.

13:03.676 --> 13:05.577
Only because
it's less paperwork.

13:09.014 --> 13:11.716
Why are you spending
Christmas Eve alone?

13:14.487 --> 13:17.422
Because the Myka I know,
my Myka,

13:17.489 --> 13:19.623
she's surrounded by people
who love her.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.626
- People love me.
- Who?

13:21.693 --> 13:23.227
People.

13:23.295 --> 13:27.464
My secretary gave me this pen
for Christmas.

13:27.532 --> 13:28.832
It's Mont Blanc.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.900
You bought that
for yourself.

13:29.968 --> 13:32.703
No, I didn't.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.104
So what if I did?

13:34.172 --> 13:35.439
How did--
how do you know that?

13:35.506 --> 13:37.774
Because nobody gives or wants

13:37.842 --> 13:39.209
a fancy pen
for Christmas

13:39.277 --> 13:40.710
unless they grew up
in a bookstore

13:40.778 --> 13:43.513
and have a deep and reverent
love for the written word.

13:43.581 --> 13:45.582
And that is my Myka.

13:45.649 --> 13:50.119
Well, this Myka
is creeped out.

13:50.187 --> 13:52.688
Okay, look,
I know it sounds bad--

13:52.756 --> 13:54.823
living in South Dakota,
working at a warehouse

13:54.891 --> 13:57.492
with an emotionally-stunted
partner--

13:57.560 --> 13:58.993
but my Myka loves it.

13:59.061 --> 14:01.129
And why is that?

14:01.197 --> 14:06.100
Because she knows the world
is full of endless wonder.

14:08.270 --> 14:11.005
Endless wonder?

14:12.807 --> 14:16.777
We're done here.

14:16.845 --> 14:19.981
Your father's still alive.

14:25.121 --> 14:28.056
My Myka reconciled with him
a couple years ago.

14:28.124 --> 14:33.529
She's spending Christmas
at home in Colorado.

14:33.597 --> 14:37.299
That is a cheap shot.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.434
It really is,
using my family,

14:38.502 --> 14:40.136
but my relationship
with my father

14:40.203 --> 14:42.204
is no secret.
But his book was a secret,

14:42.272 --> 14:43.205
wasn't it?

14:43.273 --> 14:46.509
How did you...

14:46.577 --> 14:48.010
Mom burned that.

14:48.078 --> 14:49.578
I didn't even know about that
until after dad...

14:49.646 --> 14:52.647
<i>The Blue Willow Sky.</i>

14:52.715 --> 14:54.315
It was about you.

14:54.383 --> 14:56.717
You read it to him
when he was sick,

14:56.785 --> 14:59.821
and he got better.

14:59.889 --> 15:02.491
You saved him, Myka.

15:02.558 --> 15:06.295
And now I need you
to save me.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.438
Let me be perfectly clear.

15:15.506 --> 15:18.908
I know places where people
would never find your body.

15:18.976 --> 15:20.410
Deal.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.112
I'll even dig the hole.

15:22.179 --> 15:23.913
Okay.

15:23.981 --> 15:25.882
Now the guy we're looking for

15:25.949 --> 15:27.550
is Artie Nielsen.

15:27.618 --> 15:30.586
Wait, do you mean
Arthur Weisfelt?

15:30.653 --> 15:31.853
Good.
Good, good.

15:31.921 --> 15:34.389
You know him.
Oh, he'll know what to do.

15:34.457 --> 15:36.557
Do you know
where he is?

15:36.625 --> 15:39.394
Yes.
He's right where I left him.

15:40.996 --> 15:43.464
Weisfelt,
you have a visitor.

16:01.702 --> 16:04.737
You!

16:04.805 --> 16:06.005
You remember me!

16:06.073 --> 16:08.208
No. Her!
Agent Bering.

16:08.275 --> 16:09.575
How can I forget the reason
I haven't seen daylight

16:09.643 --> 16:10.877
in over three years?

16:10.944 --> 16:12.211
That's what happens
to people

16:12.279 --> 16:14.114
who try to assassinate
the President.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.416
I was trying to snag and bag
the bloodstone,

16:16.484 --> 16:18.519
and people died because you
wouldn't let me do my j--

16:18.586 --> 16:20.187
what am I doing?
What's the point?

16:20.254 --> 16:21.755
The bloodstone,
the museum.

16:21.823 --> 16:23.291
That's where I met you guys
for the first time.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.692
That was our first artifact.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.728
Ha ha.
One step forward.

16:26.795 --> 16:27.895
Artifact?
Who are you?

16:27.963 --> 16:29.464
And two steps back.
Okay.

16:29.532 --> 16:33.368
Artie, look, I need you
to take a leap of faith with me.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.471
My name is Agent Pete Lattimer,

16:37.539 --> 16:40.308
I've worked at Warehouse 13
since we met

16:40.375 --> 16:41.809
at the museum
with the bloodstone,

16:41.877 --> 16:44.679
and I've been trying--
- stop.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.413
What did you touch?

16:46.481 --> 16:48.882
Me.
No, I haven't touched anything.

16:48.950 --> 16:49.950
It's MacPherson.

16:50.017 --> 16:51.084
MacPherson's the one

16:51.152 --> 16:52.719
that made the world
go all wonky...

16:52.786 --> 16:54.888
Wait, wait,
when exactly, exactly

16:54.955 --> 16:56.189
did the world start
to go wonky?

16:56.257 --> 16:57.925
After I put back
Rudolph's nose

16:57.992 --> 17:00.194
in the Christmas aisle.

17:00.262 --> 17:02.096
The aisle of Noel.

17:02.164 --> 17:03.164
Wait a minute.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.464
Did you by any chance

17:04.532 --> 17:06.768
touch a brush?

17:06.836 --> 17:09.972
One with a long green handle

17:10.039 --> 17:12.074
and tan-colored bristles?

17:12.142 --> 17:13.943
Does fell on me
count as touched?

17:14.011 --> 17:17.646
Philip van Doren Stern's

17:17.714 --> 17:21.249
upholstery brush.
- Stern.

17:21.317 --> 17:23.685
He wrote a short story
called "The Greatest Gift".

17:23.752 --> 17:25.353
The movie <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>
was based on it.

17:25.421 --> 17:26.721
It's not important.

17:26.789 --> 17:29.023
See, Myka knows things.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.458
Even when you're not Myka,
you're Myka.

17:31.526 --> 17:33.726
See, if you touched
that brush,

17:33.794 --> 17:36.396
then you were literally
swept away.

17:36.463 --> 17:37.731
You've never been born.

17:37.798 --> 17:41.201
What are you talking about?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.902
I've been born.
See, I'm here.

17:42.970 --> 17:44.137
The world is here.

17:44.205 --> 17:45.572
In fact, you know,

17:45.640 --> 17:47.374
I've kind of saved it
a few times.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.809
You?

17:50.711 --> 17:52.579
Saved the world.

17:52.646 --> 17:54.447
Yes.
I can prove it.

17:54.515 --> 17:56.883
Okay?
Just hold on.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.685
Where is it?

17:58.753 --> 18:00.753
Man, Catie's candy cane
is gone.

18:00.821 --> 18:02.822
Catie's candy cane is gone
because you've never existed.

18:02.890 --> 18:06.260
Okay, what does that
even mean?

18:06.327 --> 18:07.628
Okay, wait,

18:07.695 --> 18:10.231
because I wasn't there,
Myka arrested you?

18:10.299 --> 18:13.234
And I went to jail,
and MacPherson somehow convinced

18:13.302 --> 18:16.037
the Regents
that he had been rehabilitated.

18:16.105 --> 18:18.006
Well, if H.G. Wells
could do it.

18:20.676 --> 18:22.577
Never mind.

18:22.645 --> 18:28.049
Okay, so, somehow,
if this Pete Lattimer existed,

18:28.117 --> 18:30.719
he kept my father
from having a heart attack?

18:30.786 --> 18:32.254
It's possible.
If he played a part

18:32.321 --> 18:34.055
in mending the relationship
between you and your father,

18:34.123 --> 18:35.890
then it could have had
a positive effect

18:35.958 --> 18:38.258
on your father's health,
yeah.

18:40.428 --> 18:42.262
I want to believe you,

18:42.329 --> 18:44.363
I do,
it's just--

18:44.431 --> 18:45.965
Iinsane.
Yeah, I know,

18:46.033 --> 18:47.933
but people's lives
are far more intertwined

18:48.001 --> 18:49.468
than we all realize.
Intertwined?

18:49.536 --> 18:52.204
As in a nut ball follows me home

18:52.272 --> 18:54.407
from a bar,
I release a terrorist

18:54.474 --> 18:56.142
from prison,
and then what, I lose my job?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.445
Yeah, I'd say
that's about right.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.213
Put it that way,
yeah, you got it, I think.

19:00.281 --> 19:01.748
I mean, yeah.

19:01.815 --> 19:03.450
I was the arresting officer.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.085
You can remand him
to my custody.

19:05.153 --> 19:07.021
Absolutely no way.
You need a presiding judge

19:07.088 --> 19:08.189
to sign a--
- Sir.

19:08.256 --> 19:09.490
I think you need
to read this.

19:09.558 --> 19:10.524
Excuse me.

19:13.229 --> 19:15.563
Look, I was crazy
to even ask.

19:15.631 --> 19:17.465
This will never fly.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.033
It would take a miracle
to get him released

19:19.101 --> 19:20.668
on such short--
- Agent Bering.

19:20.735 --> 19:23.870
It seems that you can have
Mr. Weisfelt for 24 hours.

19:23.938 --> 19:25.171
What? Just like that?

19:25.239 --> 19:27.073
But you said I had
no authorization.

19:27.141 --> 19:29.476
Someone higher up
is pulling this string.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.844
Mrs. Frederic?

19:37.718 --> 19:40.020
MacPherson's not just
gonna let us walk back

19:40.087 --> 19:41.821
into the warehouse.
I can't walk in there at all.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.090
He's injected me
with some kind of solution

19:44.158 --> 19:47.060
that reacts violently to the
painite in the warehouse walls.

19:47.127 --> 19:48.361
Violently
is an understatement.

19:48.429 --> 19:50.129
I mean, there's sizzling

19:50.197 --> 19:53.166
and caving in
and bones turning into...

19:53.234 --> 19:55.568
I mean, it's not gonna happen
to you.

19:55.636 --> 19:58.972
Anyway, no one has ever broken
into Warehouse 13.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.276
Well, that's not exactly true.

20:01.343 --> 20:02.944
How well do you remember
Claudia Donovan?

20:08.351 --> 20:10.019
James.

20:10.086 --> 20:12.154
You were right.
Weisfelt was released

20:12.222 --> 20:13.856
from prison,
and Lattimer was with him.

20:13.923 --> 20:16.458
Ah, and one particularly
interesting detail.

20:16.526 --> 20:17.593
He's more dangerous
than I thought.

20:17.661 --> 20:19.562
Go join Sandra.

20:19.630 --> 20:20.863
I want him stopped
and brought back.

20:20.931 --> 20:23.165
One way or another?

20:23.233 --> 20:24.566
Surprise me.

20:37.459 --> 20:39.560
All right, 307.
This is it.

20:39.628 --> 20:41.829
Now I think you guys
should wait out here.

20:41.897 --> 20:42.897
We don't want to frighten
the poor girl,

20:42.964 --> 20:45.132
and she may remember me.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.435
So...

20:47.503 --> 20:49.438
Hello?
Claudia Donovan?

20:49.506 --> 20:52.441
Hello?
Claudia?

20:52.508 --> 20:55.778
Hello? Claudia?

21:12.062 --> 21:13.863
Hello, Professor.

21:13.930 --> 21:15.497
Claudia.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.433
I was really hoping
you'd come visit me some day.

21:20.636 --> 21:22.370
- What?
- Happy holidays.

21:26.008 --> 21:28.510
What the hell
is that?

21:28.578 --> 21:30.379
You work with what you got.
Now you're gonna help me

21:30.447 --> 21:32.582
get my brother back.

21:32.649 --> 21:34.551
Help! Help!
Claudia!

21:34.618 --> 21:35.885
Claudia, listen.

21:35.953 --> 21:38.388
Your brother Joshua,
he's trapped

21:38.456 --> 21:40.123
in an interdimensional space,

21:40.191 --> 21:41.525
but we know
how to get him back.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.694
- We do?
- We do?

21:43.762 --> 21:45.729
You know about Joshua?

21:45.797 --> 21:47.331
Yes, and Rheticus' compass.

21:47.399 --> 21:48.399
You're not crazy.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.868
Okay, it all happened.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.036
And we're gonna save him,

21:51.104 --> 21:53.071
but we need your help.

21:53.139 --> 21:54.773
Stay.

21:54.841 --> 21:58.043
What do you want me to do?

21:58.111 --> 22:00.679
Break into a large depository
filled with mystical artifacts

22:00.747 --> 22:02.080
located in the South Dakota
Badlands.

22:02.148 --> 22:03.515
Warehouse 13?

22:03.583 --> 22:05.317
I've been trying to hack
into that place for years.

22:05.385 --> 22:06.484
- One condition.
- Name it.

22:06.552 --> 22:07.685
- When we're done, I get him.
- Deal.

22:07.753 --> 22:09.154
- Hey.
- Relax.

22:09.221 --> 22:10.489
She shocks you all the time.

22:10.556 --> 22:12.157
It's your thing.

22:12.225 --> 22:14.359
Breaking out two inmates
in one day--

22:14.427 --> 22:15.494
really doesn't sound
like me.

22:18.798 --> 22:21.600
And now we run.

22:23.035 --> 22:24.069
Split up!

22:24.137 --> 22:26.338
Not you!

22:32.112 --> 22:35.648
Right behind me!

22:41.121 --> 22:43.689
She-bangie!

22:44.858 --> 22:46.291
Raymond!

22:48.328 --> 22:50.296
Hey, secret agent lady.

22:55.202 --> 22:56.802
She-bangie too.

22:59.906 --> 23:01.507
Good job...

23:01.575 --> 23:03.442
Partner.

23:03.510 --> 23:05.211
How long have you two
been partners?

23:05.279 --> 23:06.445
- Three hours.
- Three years.

23:08.081 --> 23:09.616
Somebody let me out of here.

23:09.683 --> 23:11.184
Hey!

23:18.327 --> 23:19.527
Hello, James.

23:19.595 --> 23:21.396
Mrs. Frederic.

23:21.464 --> 23:23.532
Sneaking up on me
like that

23:23.600 --> 23:25.300
could spoil
your holiday surprise.

23:25.368 --> 23:27.603
Why have you pulled our agents
from the hunt

23:27.670 --> 23:29.571
for Shakespeare's lost folio?

23:29.639 --> 23:31.873
I didn't think I had to clear
every order with you.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.410
Why do you have surveillance
on Artie's prison cell?

23:34.477 --> 23:36.412
Not sure I like your tone.

23:36.479 --> 23:38.413
Why was I not told
there was an intruder

23:38.481 --> 23:41.516
who claims that you have been
selling artifacts

23:41.584 --> 23:43.051
and who--

23:43.119 --> 23:45.753
Can't move?

23:45.821 --> 23:47.121
DeMille's riding crop.

23:47.189 --> 23:49.089
It comes in handy.

23:49.157 --> 23:52.492
I have rather a special gift
for you.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.229
But I couldn't think
how to wrap it.

23:58.232 --> 24:01.700
If you do this, James,
there'll be no turning back.

24:01.768 --> 24:03.468
What other choice
did you give me?

24:03.536 --> 24:06.138
You freed Arthur because you
trust him more than me.

24:06.206 --> 24:09.107
This is not the most
convincing way to win me over.

24:09.175 --> 24:11.576
I did try.

24:11.644 --> 24:14.879
I spent three years looking for
a way to appreciate the work

24:14.947 --> 24:16.715
that you and the Regents do.

24:16.782 --> 24:17.749
And?

24:17.817 --> 24:20.052
I couldn't find it.

24:34.601 --> 24:36.168
They got away, James.

24:36.236 --> 24:37.236
There's four of them now.

24:37.304 --> 24:38.671
Get back here immediately.

24:38.739 --> 24:40.239
The warehouse is under attack.

24:40.307 --> 24:42.875
No one can be trusted.

24:51.789 --> 24:54.089
So a magic necklace

24:54.157 --> 24:55.257
is gonna keep your blood
from turning

24:55.325 --> 24:56.692
to acid
when you enter the warehouse?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.193
It's not magic.
It is science.

24:58.261 --> 25:00.462
And yes.
And be quiet.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.331
Oh, you know what, do not
tell me what to do, old man.

25:02.398 --> 25:04.700
Old man?

25:04.768 --> 25:05.701
Ow!

25:05.768 --> 25:06.835
Old man.

25:06.903 --> 25:08.604
You're a little juvenile--
- hey!

25:08.671 --> 25:10.505
Hey, don't turn on the...

25:10.573 --> 25:11.974
Leena.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.375
Hi.

25:13.443 --> 25:18.848
Um, you haven't met Claudia
or Myka yet.

25:18.916 --> 25:21.184
But you really like them.

25:21.251 --> 25:23.419
I don't know what those
Fascists have told you, Leena,

25:23.487 --> 25:25.154
but you know me.

25:25.222 --> 25:28.091
And you know what an artifact
can do.

25:28.158 --> 25:30.326
If you would just trust me,
trust me this once.

25:30.394 --> 25:32.996
Stop.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.465
Something wasn't right,
I could feel it.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.505
I'm glad you're back, Artie.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.655
Thank you.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.033
I know there's an exit here.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.936
You used it to smuggle out
H.G. Wells.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.838
Why do you keep talking
about him?

26:11.905 --> 26:13.773
H.G. Wells is a woman.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.974
You guys were best pals.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.308
She gave you a grappler.

26:16.376 --> 26:18.844
You know what,
just stop talking.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.780
More like Myka
every minute.

26:21.848 --> 26:24.416
It's here!

26:24.484 --> 26:26.051
It's here.
I've got it.

26:26.119 --> 26:29.087
It just--it looks like a wall
of rock.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.755
Yeah, well,
looks can be deceiving.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.124
This is the original entrance
to Warehouse 9

26:33.192 --> 26:34.793
in Constantinople.

26:34.860 --> 26:38.597
And also it was the inspiration
for <i>Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.</i>

26:38.664 --> 26:41.032
"Behind this door
lies boundless treasure."

26:41.100 --> 26:42.834
Very good.
Yes.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.237
Well, then what?
We just say "open sesame"?

26:45.305 --> 26:47.073
Yes, but unless one of us
can say it in Arabic,

26:47.140 --> 26:49.943
we're gonna have
to find another way in.

26:50.010 --> 26:51.578
<i>Iftah ya simsim.</i>

27:04.157 --> 27:05.356
Miss Donovan,

27:05.424 --> 27:06.691
it looks like you're up.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.794
Good work.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.095
Really?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.197
It was in the first edition.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.665
I will never make fun of you
again.

27:14.733 --> 27:17.501
- How come I don't believe that?
- Ah.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.540
- Oof.
- Careful.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.909
If you activate
the security countermeasures,

27:24.977 --> 27:26.812
then frostbite will be
the least of our problems.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.180
Rest it,
will ya?

27:28.248 --> 27:30.516
I take precautions
before I do something dangerous

27:30.584 --> 27:31.517
to the people
around me.

27:31.585 --> 27:33.620
Claudia, I'm really sorry

27:33.688 --> 27:34.788
that your brother--
- Not now, gramps.

27:34.855 --> 27:36.623
I'm being awesome.

27:43.231 --> 27:44.965
Knock knock.

27:45.033 --> 27:46.600
Claudia, wait.
Claudia.

27:46.668 --> 27:50.604
Claudia, wait.
Wait.

27:50.672 --> 27:52.239
Dude,
you're such an old woman.

27:52.307 --> 27:55.777
We're in.
All we have to...

27:55.845 --> 27:57.012
- Oh.
- Yes.

27:57.079 --> 27:58.179
Oh.

27:58.247 --> 27:59.415
Well, which one do we take?

27:59.482 --> 28:01.083
They're all exactly the same.

28:01.151 --> 28:02.752
Only one of them
will take us to the warehouse.

28:02.819 --> 28:03.853
And the other two?

28:03.921 --> 28:05.389
Don't.

28:05.456 --> 28:06.990
It's the one on the left.

28:08.126 --> 28:09.059
How do you know that?

28:09.127 --> 28:13.832
I got a vibe.

28:13.899 --> 28:14.899
Is that some sort
of code or...

28:14.967 --> 28:17.201
Hell if I know.

28:17.269 --> 28:18.636
Great.

28:18.703 --> 28:19.837
Hey.

28:19.905 --> 28:21.839
- Pete. Pete.
- What?

28:21.907 --> 28:23.741
Pull.

28:23.809 --> 28:25.476
Yes.
Would it kill you

28:25.544 --> 28:26.911
to put up a sign?

28:26.979 --> 28:29.548
Oh, I'll put that
at the top of my to-do list.

28:29.615 --> 28:33.251
So this vibe
that you were talking about,

28:33.318 --> 28:34.719
does it actually...

28:39.090 --> 28:40.490
Oh, my God.

28:40.558 --> 28:42.392
All I want to do is find my...

28:42.460 --> 28:43.560
Holy crap.

28:43.628 --> 28:46.362
Hi, honey.

28:46.430 --> 28:47.664
I'm home.

28:48.832 --> 28:51.134
This is...

28:51.201 --> 28:52.802
What is this?

28:52.870 --> 28:53.836
Welcome to Warehouse 13.

28:58.910 --> 29:01.178
Okay.
It razzled. I'm dazzled.

29:01.245 --> 29:02.579
Now let's find your brush,
my compass,

29:02.647 --> 29:05.048
and we'll get you some courage.
I want my brother back.

29:05.116 --> 29:07.484
Hey, hey, Claud.

29:07.552 --> 29:10.989
You know, it's not just
about Joshua or the compass.

29:11.056 --> 29:14.358
The three of us,
we're your family too.

29:14.426 --> 29:15.959
I mean,
I'm like your big brother.

29:16.027 --> 29:18.829
And Myka's like your big sister.

29:18.897 --> 29:22.466
And Artie's so much like
your dad, it's kind of annoying.

29:22.534 --> 29:26.403
And, in the real world,
we've already rescued Josh.

29:26.471 --> 29:29.273
He's at Cern.

29:29.341 --> 29:31.342
And the four of us,

29:31.410 --> 29:33.344
we work here every day,

29:33.412 --> 29:35.446
surrounded by this...

29:35.514 --> 29:36.714
This...

29:36.781 --> 29:38.348
Endless wonder?

29:40.484 --> 29:43.719
Oh, and Artie...

29:43.787 --> 29:45.454
makes the best cookies
in the world.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.089
Well, maybe not the best.

29:47.157 --> 29:48.690
Oh, can we please?

29:48.758 --> 29:49.858
So pushy.
Listen, do you know

29:49.926 --> 29:50.925
how to get
to the aisle of Noel?

29:50.993 --> 29:52.093
Shyeah.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.394
More or less.

29:53.462 --> 29:56.231
All right, come here.
Come here.

29:56.299 --> 29:58.600
Look, all right,
straight down there,

29:58.668 --> 30:00.669
starting there,
you go 40 rows,

30:00.737 --> 30:02.071
you go straight,
you turn left

30:02.138 --> 30:03.339
at Buckingham 311.

30:03.407 --> 30:05.207
Then you turn right
at the Woodmont sector,

30:05.275 --> 30:06.309
you go ten more rows,

30:06.376 --> 30:08.978
you turn right at Peyton 1222.

30:09.046 --> 30:09.979
You got that?
Shyeah.

30:10.047 --> 30:11.681
- Okay.
- More or less.

30:11.749 --> 30:12.916
I'll remember that.

30:12.984 --> 30:15.586
Huh.
Okay.

30:15.653 --> 30:16.987
Good.
You two go get the brush,

30:17.055 --> 30:18.455
and Claudia and I
will go to the office computers

30:18.522 --> 30:19.956
and try and figure out
how to reverse the effect.

30:20.024 --> 30:22.259
No way I could go with them,
is there?

30:22.327 --> 30:25.896
Not a chance.
Come with me, daughter.

30:30.569 --> 30:33.871
This is the turn--
Peyton 1222.

30:38.544 --> 30:41.613
That's...
That's...

30:41.680 --> 30:43.647
That's artifact juju at work.

30:43.715 --> 30:45.583
Come on.

30:52.356 --> 30:54.424
Oh, damn.

30:54.492 --> 30:56.827
It's MacPherson.
He set a trap.

30:56.894 --> 30:59.631
Okay, wait, look,
if this MacPherson knew

30:59.698 --> 31:01.600
that we'd be here, then what
about Artie and Claudia?

31:03.936 --> 31:07.439
James always loved
these damn things.

31:11.177 --> 31:14.646
Bonsai, Jimmy!
What are you doing?

31:14.713 --> 31:16.781
Trying to find a way
around these security protocols.

31:16.849 --> 31:18.984
Silence from the landscaping
department, please.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.418
I set this system up.

31:20.486 --> 31:23.455
I was a top NSA cryptographer.

31:23.523 --> 31:25.090
You can't just--
- And I'm in.

31:25.158 --> 31:28.460
Eh. Oh, well, they must have
loosened up the security.

31:28.528 --> 31:30.796
If that's what you need
to tell yourself, Deputy Dog.

31:30.863 --> 31:32.397
Yeah, so...

31:32.464 --> 31:34.665
Fine, you hack.
I'll navigate.

31:34.733 --> 31:35.867
Just click there.
Click--cli--

31:35.934 --> 31:37.468
there. It's just there.
Stop.

31:38.837 --> 31:40.704
That's it.

31:40.772 --> 31:42.506
But...

31:42.574 --> 31:45.175
That is not good news.

31:50.648 --> 31:53.583
What is it?
Rheumatism acting up?

31:53.650 --> 31:54.650
No, look out.

31:58.355 --> 31:59.989
Hello, Arthur.

32:07.497 --> 32:08.964
How do we usually solve
this stuff?

32:09.032 --> 32:11.566
Well, we--we goo it,

32:11.634 --> 32:13.168
we break it,
or we outsmart it.

32:18.307 --> 32:20.508
Wait a minute, that's
your I've-got-a-plan look.

32:20.575 --> 32:21.775
I love that look.

32:21.843 --> 32:22.876
We're kind of trapped

32:22.944 --> 32:24.644
in an infinity band here,
right?

32:24.712 --> 32:27.180
Duh.
What now?

32:27.248 --> 32:30.116
Okay, a lemniscate.

32:30.184 --> 32:32.485
It's a term
in algebraic geometry.

32:32.553 --> 32:35.622
It's a figure-eight-shaped curve
that never meets itself--

32:35.689 --> 32:37.891
you know what,
I'll explain it later.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.327
Listen, if we both move--
well, if we run

32:40.395 --> 32:42.196
as fast as we can
in opposite directions,

32:42.264 --> 32:45.400
we might be able
to kind of snap ourselves

32:45.468 --> 32:46.468
out of it.
- Okay.

32:46.536 --> 32:47.469
- All right.
- You ready?

32:47.537 --> 32:48.537
- Yes.
- Snap.

32:48.605 --> 32:50.172
- Okay.
- On your marks...

32:50.240 --> 32:51.407
- Yeah.
- Get set...

32:51.475 --> 32:52.875
- Right.
- Go.

33:01.751 --> 33:03.953
Pete, I think it's working!

33:04.020 --> 33:07.890
I really should get back
into my cardio.

33:25.407 --> 33:29.544
Oh.
Oh, God.

33:29.611 --> 33:31.112
Oh.

33:33.215 --> 33:37.352
And that
is why we're partners.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.288
The Christmas aisle should be
right around this...

33:40.657 --> 33:43.492
Ah, humbug.

33:47.898 --> 33:50.733
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas!

33:52.893 --> 33:54.227
This is my fault.

33:54.295 --> 33:55.962
I told MacPherson
I was in the Christmas aisle.

33:56.030 --> 33:57.030
Of course
he's gonna figure out

33:57.098 --> 33:58.498
the artifact came from there.

33:58.566 --> 34:00.300
Well, he must not know
which artifact it is.

34:00.368 --> 34:01.868
If he took them all,
we still have

34:01.936 --> 34:03.336
the advantage.

34:03.404 --> 34:04.804
No, we don't.

34:04.872 --> 34:07.007
He's got Artie and Claudia.

34:07.074 --> 34:10.944
I just got a bad feeling
about...

34:11.012 --> 34:12.379
Yup.

34:12.447 --> 34:14.047
He took 'em
to the bronze sector.

34:14.114 --> 34:15.349
The bronze sector?

34:15.416 --> 34:17.418
I'll tell you
on the ride.

34:17.485 --> 34:19.219
Ride?

34:33.536 --> 34:34.969
Listen to me,
what's your name?

34:35.038 --> 34:36.638
Sandra.
Let her go.

34:36.706 --> 34:37.839
She knows nothing
about all this.

34:37.907 --> 34:39.639
Orders are orders.

34:39.708 --> 34:40.842
You should know that,
Weisfelt.

34:40.909 --> 34:42.810
That's not how I ran
this place.

34:42.877 --> 34:45.312
Which is probably why you're
about to be bronzed.

34:47.882 --> 34:51.085
Listen, Professor...

34:51.152 --> 34:53.286
Artie...

34:53.355 --> 34:56.290
Thanks for saving me from
the slice-and-dice back there.

34:56.357 --> 34:59.426
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
I can't help out now.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.896
Listen,
according to the manual,

35:02.964 --> 35:05.265
this isn't supposed
to be painful.

35:05.332 --> 35:08.701
Yeah, I don't know.
Just take a deep breath.

35:10.504 --> 35:14.307
Hey, goon squad.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.409
Ray, look out.

35:27.423 --> 35:29.592
Oh, I love this thing.

35:34.464 --> 35:36.165
Good job.

35:36.233 --> 35:39.435
Got to show me that move.

35:39.503 --> 35:41.537
Mrs. Frederic.
He bronzed--

35:41.605 --> 35:42.771
Yeah, no time.

35:42.839 --> 35:45.174
She'll keep.
We got to go.

35:45.241 --> 35:46.608
Keep?

35:55.084 --> 35:57.385
In order to reverse
the effects of the Stern brush,

35:57.453 --> 35:59.588
all Pete has to do
is touch it again.

35:59.656 --> 36:01.456
Well, what if MacPherson
touches it first?

36:01.524 --> 36:02.724
No, it's linked to Pete now.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.059
It's not going to affect
anybody else,

36:04.126 --> 36:05.727
but if we don't find it,
that would be bad.

36:05.795 --> 36:06.728
I figured.

36:06.796 --> 36:07.829
And James is going to try

36:07.897 --> 36:08.964
to make this reality permanent

36:09.032 --> 36:10.065
by destroying
the brush.

36:10.133 --> 36:11.099
And you know how,
don't you?

36:11.167 --> 36:12.100
Yeah, there's only one way

36:12.168 --> 36:13.669
that he can be sure.

36:13.737 --> 36:16.772
He is headed
for the Lehmann Fornax.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.642
You just make this stuff up,
don't you?

36:19.709 --> 36:22.712
In 1939, Inge Lehmann
discovered the earth

36:22.779 --> 36:24.980
had a super-heated core,
and we've been using it

36:25.048 --> 36:27.549
to heat this warehouse
since 1943.

36:27.617 --> 36:28.917
Whoa, whoa, wait.
This place is heated

36:28.984 --> 36:30.852
by a giant furnace powered
by the earth's core?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.820
You should see
the air-conditioner.

36:41.798 --> 36:43.232
He's up there.

36:43.299 --> 36:46.068
See?
So you just keep him talking.

36:46.136 --> 36:47.336
What are you gonna do?

36:47.404 --> 36:52.476
Find a way
to be awesome.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.311
Hey, Jimmy!

36:54.379 --> 36:56.513
So it's four against one.

36:56.581 --> 36:58.915
How do you want this
to go down?

36:58.983 --> 37:01.151
What a wonderful choice
of words.

37:05.656 --> 37:06.723
He's locked us in.

37:09.193 --> 37:10.727
Aagh!

37:13.130 --> 37:14.497
Still think I'm crazy?

37:14.564 --> 37:15.864
I'll let you know
when I wake up.

37:15.932 --> 37:17.867
I'm sure I can find a way
to override this.

37:17.934 --> 37:19.135
Okay, okay,

37:19.202 --> 37:21.070
James,
I may have been wrong

37:21.137 --> 37:22.371
about the other reality.

37:22.439 --> 37:23.773
Maybe you're not dead.

37:23.841 --> 37:25.375
Maybe you're rich,

37:25.443 --> 37:26.710
you're famous.

37:26.777 --> 37:28.244
Are you gonna tell me
which one of these,

37:28.312 --> 37:31.248
Mr. Lattimer, or shall I have
to toss in the whole bag?

37:32.817 --> 37:34.017
No, no, you can't destroy

37:34.085 --> 37:36.253
that many artifacts at once.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.754
You could kill us all.

37:37.822 --> 37:40.090
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

37:40.158 --> 37:42.192
I suppose I should thank you,
Mr. Lattimer.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.594
Thank me for what?

37:43.662 --> 37:45.496
Your sudden appearance
brought things to a head

37:45.564 --> 37:46.964
between myself
and the Regents.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.166
Arthur knows.

37:48.233 --> 37:51.103
Don't you, Arthur?

37:51.170 --> 37:52.704
Arthur!

37:56.441 --> 37:57.942
The Lenape cloak.

37:58.010 --> 38:00.478
You know you shouldn't play
with artifacts, Arthur.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.046
You know this is wrong.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.880
I'm not the one who broke in.
Get out of my warehouse.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.182
Your warehouse?
Over my dead body.

38:05.249 --> 38:06.349
Excellent idea.

38:10.821 --> 38:11.787
Hang on.
I've almost got it.

38:11.855 --> 38:14.790
Artie, Artie!

38:14.857 --> 38:16.124
The brush!

38:16.192 --> 38:18.060
Artie, look behind you!

38:24.100 --> 38:25.801
Don't make me do this.

38:25.869 --> 38:27.236
Give me the brush, Arthur.

38:27.303 --> 38:28.470
Claudia!

38:28.538 --> 38:29.538
Almost, almost.

38:29.606 --> 38:30.840
There's not enough time.

38:30.907 --> 38:32.641
Artie.

38:32.709 --> 38:33.943
You know what you're doing?

38:34.011 --> 38:36.545
- Artie.
- Taking a leap of faith.

38:38.715 --> 38:40.082
So am I.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.751
No!

38:44.621 --> 38:46.488
Pete!

38:58.167 --> 39:00.869
Oh, no, you don't.

39:00.936 --> 39:05.107
Ooh, ooh, ow.

39:05.175 --> 39:07.076
Ah.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.078
Thank you for saving Bucky.

39:32.535 --> 39:33.702
Hey, Trailer.

39:33.769 --> 39:35.136
Ugh!

39:37.039 --> 39:39.574
Mm.

39:41.805 --> 39:43.339
Oh, come on,
Mrs. F.

39:43.406 --> 39:44.840
Please.

39:44.908 --> 39:46.075
Absolutely not.
When you're older,

39:46.142 --> 39:47.476
then you can add schnapps.
Not before.

39:47.544 --> 39:48.844
How much older
do I have to be?

39:48.912 --> 39:50.271
It's Christmas.

39:50.296 --> 39:51.496
Shoulda left with Steve.

39:53.751 --> 39:56.118
You're here.

39:56.186 --> 39:58.554
- You're still here.
- Yeah, we never left.

39:58.622 --> 40:00.523
It's the worst blizzard
in South Dakota history.

40:00.591 --> 40:02.258
Nobody's getting out,
not even...

40:02.326 --> 40:03.893
It's that bad.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.994
What about Artie?

40:05.062 --> 40:06.763
- He's here, right?
- Hot!

40:06.830 --> 40:09.499
Oatmeal scotchies!

40:09.567 --> 40:12.168
The only person happy about it
is smiley Magoo over here.

40:12.236 --> 40:13.904
But he looks fantastic.

40:13.971 --> 40:15.105
Yeah, I look
like I should be parking cars.

40:15.172 --> 40:16.806
Vanessa got snowed in too,

40:16.874 --> 40:18.542
so it's only my father
and Hugo

40:18.609 --> 40:20.644
that are gonna be in Vegas.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.779
I guess it truly is
a season of miracles.

40:22.847 --> 40:24.681
Myka.
Where's Myka?

40:24.749 --> 40:26.116
I'm right here!

40:26.184 --> 40:28.118
I just got a new flight.

40:28.185 --> 40:29.452
Whoa, whoa, what--

40:29.520 --> 40:31.154
- Mwah.
- What? What do you want?

40:31.222 --> 40:33.056
No, I am not trading jobs
with you, okay?

40:33.124 --> 40:34.324
I am leaving
tomorrow morning.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.058
I know.
You're going to see your dad,

40:36.126 --> 40:38.260
because he is still alive!

40:39.796 --> 40:41.464
Yes!

40:41.532 --> 40:42.999
This is the best Christmas ever.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.801
- Uh, Pete...
- And without me

40:44.869 --> 40:46.570
you would still be
in crazy town.

40:46.638 --> 40:48.606
Mwah.
Mwah.

40:48.673 --> 40:50.174
Oh, and Artemis,
Artemis,

40:50.242 --> 40:52.143
Artemis...

40:52.211 --> 40:54.579
You would be in prison.
Not a great look for you.

40:54.647 --> 40:55.981
Oh, and the lovely Leena.
Leena...

40:57.617 --> 40:59.518
You eventually
do the right thing.

40:59.586 --> 41:00.819
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be.

41:00.887 --> 41:01.987
How could you know?

41:02.055 --> 41:04.623
And you.

41:04.691 --> 41:06.892
Mrs. Frederic,
Mrs. F.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.360
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hug you.

41:08.427 --> 41:11.296
But I am what's keeping you
from being bronzed.

41:11.363 --> 41:12.664
Oh, Agent Lattimer,
please.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.133
Oh, okay.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.644
I kind of crossed
the line there, didn't I?

41:26.712 --> 41:28.379
And we won't speak
of it again.

41:30.716 --> 41:32.049
- Pete.
- Yeah.

41:32.117 --> 41:34.385
- What is going on?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

41:34.453 --> 41:35.987
I just, um...

41:36.054 --> 41:37.622
Are you all right?

41:37.689 --> 41:40.525
- 'Cause...
- Yeah.

41:40.593 --> 41:41.626
Yeah.

41:41.694 --> 41:42.894
Yes.

41:42.962 --> 41:46.565
Yeah, I'm just...

41:46.633 --> 41:48.201
I'm so happy
to be alive,

41:48.268 --> 41:50.937
you guys,
and I just--

41:51.005 --> 41:53.740
I really, really, really,

41:53.808 --> 41:56.944
really love you.

41:59.347 --> 42:00.380
- Okay.
- Needy much?

42:00.448 --> 42:02.249
Down, boy.
Awkward.

42:02.316 --> 42:03.350
You're being a sap.

42:04.586 --> 42:06.120
- It's time.
- Yeah?

42:06.188 --> 42:08.689
It's starting.

42:08.757 --> 42:09.924
- Yes.
