Saw what?

38:46.016 --> 38:47.985
A nano.

38:49.420 --> 38:52.555
When it was leaving me,

38:52.589 --> 38:55.892
I saw what it was thinking.

38:55.926 --> 38:57.995
Do you I wanna know?

38:59.229 --> 39:03.733
I saw millions of people, mindless,

39:03.767 --> 39:06.502
swarming like ants or fireflies.

39:06.537 --> 39:09.473
Aaron, it wants to control everybody,

39:09.507 --> 39:13.477
the whole world.

39:14.111 --> 39:15.812
But I can tell you this.

39:15.846 --> 39:19.082
If you and I won't help it,
it's gonna find people who will.

Dad?

40:09.266 --> 40:11.434
Ed.

40:27.852 --> 40:33.323
I want you to leave the
Patriots and head North

40:33.557 --> 40:35.358
to a town in Idaho.

40:35.392 --> 40:38.261
I need you to go somewhere, Ed.

40:38.295 --> 40:41.264
A place called Bradbury, Idaho.

40:41.298 --> 40:43.499
Bradbury, Idaho?

40:45.135 --> 40:47.270
I don't understand.

40:47.304 --> 40:49.807
That makes no sense.

40:50.641 --> 40:52.709
When you get there,
it's all gonna make sense.

40:52.943 --> 40:55.478
You have a higher calling now.

40:55.813 --> 40:59.016
God has chosen you.

41:00.350 --> 41:03.119
Can you remember that?

41:03.254 --> 41:06.756
I need you to do this... for me.

41:09.994 --> 41:11.527
The nano are gonna make the Patriots

41:11.562 --> 41:13.863
look like boy scouts.

41:13.897 --> 41:17.500
And there's nothing we can do to stop it.

41:17.534 --> 41:20.636
Aaron.

41:20.671 --> 41:24.874
And it all starts with this...

41:24.908 --> 41:29.078
This grinning man.

41:29.113 --> 41:32.081
What grinning man? What does that mean?
