Oh, look.
Issa Dee Liar.

Oh, ha, ha.
I see what
you did there.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.103
On that note, these are
kinda olive brownies.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.231
-These have olives in 'em?
-No, I meant, like,
an olive branch,

12:12.314 --> 12:14.275
but in brownie form.

What you doin' here, Issa?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.323

12:21.407 --> 12:23.325
came here
to clear the air.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.957
'Cause, you know,
I know we had some
miscommunications.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.626
Miscommunications?
Is that right?

12:32.710 --> 12:37.465
Yeah, we both said
some things to cause
drama between us.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.425
Well, tell me, what I do?

12:41.927 --> 12:45.389
Look, I know
I probably should've

12:45.473 --> 12:48.434
handled the NBW
situation differently,

12:48.517 --> 12:50.978
but I just want to
put that behind us,

12:51.061 --> 12:52.480
and I would love to work
with you again--

12:52.563 --> 12:53.856

Let me stop
you real quick.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.775
I just want you to see it
from my perspective.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.111
You was more concerned
with your bag than my art,

12:59.195 --> 13:00.696
so, yeah, I popped
off on the 'gram,

13:00.779 --> 13:02.072

of you apologizing,

13:02.156 --> 13:04.200

here before you.
Brownies in hand.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.049
Probably mean you
need somethin', huh?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.760
Crenshawn, you're
dragging my company,

13:22.843 --> 13:25.137
which means
you're draggin' me,
and that's impacting

13:25.221 --> 13:26.805
my ability to help
the community.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.390
We don't want
that kind of help.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.060

so unreasonable?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.520

you came to me,

13:32.603 --> 13:34.396
you just needed
one opportunity

13:34.480 --> 13:36.565
to go to the next level,
and then I told you

13:36.649 --> 13:38.692

keep driving Lyft,

13:38.776 --> 13:40.611
