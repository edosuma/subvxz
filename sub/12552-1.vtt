CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road is</i>
<i>where Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:10.510
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:14.047
<i>There's an extraterrestrial,</i>
<i>super computer in the wall,</i>

00:14.114 --> 00:17.350

-Ready?

SARAH JANE:
<i>My name is Sarah Jane Smith</i>
<i>and, once,</i>

00:54.354 --> 00:55.989
<i>I travelled among the stars.</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:01.428
<i>I saw worlds</i>
<i>beyond imagination.</i>

01:01.494 --> 01:04.030
<i>I went to places beyond</i>
<i>my wildest dreams</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:07.567
<i>and met creatures</i>
<i>beyond my darkest nightmares.</i>

01:07.634 --> 01:09.536
<i>And all of it was amazing.</i>

01:14.874 --> 01:18.144
<i>Then one day, when I wasn't</i>
<i>expecting it, I came home.</i>

01:22.215 --> 01:24.250
<i>Life changed.</i>

01:24.317 --> 01:26.553
<i>More than I could ever have</i>
<i>believed possible.</i>

01:29.189 --> 01:31.224
<i>Now I have a son.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:32.859
<i>Even a family, of sorts.</i>

01:34.861 --> 01:36.863

SARAH JANE:
Thank you for agreeing to
see me on a Sunday, Mr Yorke.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.047
YORKE: No problem, Miss Smith.

01:54.113 --> 01:57.383
Nanotechnology is the science
of molecular engineering.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.154
This is where
we grow the nanoforms.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.858
Our microscopic engineers.

02:08.026 --> 02:08.995
Please.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.432
Robots.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.368
Too small to see
with the naked eye but with
the potential of giants.

02:18.571 --> 02:19.472
Incredible!

02:19.539 --> 02:21.608
(LAUGHING)

02:21.674 --> 02:25.144
One day they will build us
anything we want,

02:25.211 --> 02:28.047
everything we need
from simple atoms.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.353
Fix a punctured tyre or
repair a damaged human heart.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.923
Who knows, even construct
a whole new planet.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.292
Or destroy the one
we already have,

02:39.359 --> 02:41.628
according to some
environmental scientists.

02:43.196 --> 02:46.833
Nanoforms out of control,
eating up all matter?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.202
It's hogwash, Miss Smith.

02:49.269 --> 02:53.573
But is it true that despite
your dramatic claims
for your nanoforms,

02:53.640 --> 02:57.143
your results have been
somewhat exaggerated
to secure investment?

02:57.210 --> 03:00.313
That investors
are unlikely to see
a return on their money

03:00.380 --> 03:01.948
for maybe 100 years?

03:04.317 --> 03:07.120
Oh, well, I'll take that as
a "no comment", shall I?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.229
SARAH JANE: <i>As I said,</i>
<i>my life changed.</i>

03:16.296 --> 03:19.666
<i>But I love my job</i>
<i>and my life.</i>

03:19.732 --> 03:23.369
<i>Because despite</i>
<i>all the amazing things</i>
<i>I saw on other planets,</i>

03:23.436 --> 03:26.806
<i>I've learnt that living on</i>
<i>Earth can be just as exciting.</i>

03:26.873 --> 03:28.107
LUKE: Look, keep practising.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.643
<i>If you keep your eyes</i>
<i>and mind open,</i>

03:30.710 --> 03:33.513

03:45.024 --> 03:47.927
<i>nothing ever looks</i>
<i>quite the same again.</i>

03:50.129 --> 03:52.131
CLYDE: So, what was that?
A meteor?

03:52.198 --> 03:54.867
Or a comet? Or something
really cool? Please tell me
it was something cool.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.803

-No way was it
something cool, Clyde.
-Mmm-ha... Yeah, yeah.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.412
You've still got a way to go
with that humour thing,
my young padawan.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.148
(LAUGHING) Come on!

04:09.215 --> 04:10.850
Mr Smith, I need you.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.925
MR SMITH: <i>Sarah Jane.</i>

04:18.992 --> 04:20.860
<i>Might I assume that</i>
<i>you witnessed</i>
<i>the extra-terrestrial body</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:22.962
<i>that recently entered</i>
<i>the Earth's atmosphere?</i>

04:23.029 --> 04:25.231
Good to see
you're on the ball,
Mr Smith.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.833
<i>Indeed, Rani.</i>

04:26.899 --> 04:28.768
<i>I have, in fact,</i>
<i>been tracking the object</i>

04:28.835 --> 04:31.504
<i>since it entered solar space</i>
<i>45 minutes ago.</i>

04:31.571 --> 04:34.240
It crossed the solar system
in 45 minutes?

04:34.307 --> 04:37.076
Well, we're not talking
about a meteor, are we?

04:37.143 --> 04:40.680
<i>I detected the</i>
<i>matter signature</i>

04:40.747 --> 04:43.082

Oh, boy. A talking rhino!

04:57.697 --> 04:59.565
He's Judoon.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.635
They work for the
Shadow Proclamation.
Sort of galactic policemen.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.504
So, they're the good guys?

05:04.570 --> 05:06.839
Depends on your point of view.
From what I've heard,

05:06.906 --> 05:09.475
their methods
aren't exactly softly-softly.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.445
<i>UNIT have isolated the</i>
<i>spacecraft crash site.</i>

05:12.512 --> 05:14.313
It's not our problem, then.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.115
-Leave it to
the professionals. Terrific.
-(SARAH JANE CHUCKLES)

05:16.182 --> 05:20.153
<i>But UNIT seem unaware</i>
<i>of the lifepod that was</i>
<i>ejected before impact.</i>

05:20.887 --> 05:23.523
Lifepod?

05:23.589 --> 05:27.193
<i>My calculations suggest that</i>
<i>it fell some 10 miles outside</i>
<i>the UNIT isolation zone,</i>

05:27.260 --> 05:29.762
<i>in the abandoned</i>
<i>Brindley Chase Council Estate.</i>

05:29.829 --> 05:31.330
Yes!

05:31.397 --> 05:32.865
It takes a lot to knock
a Judoon off his feet.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.501
But someone might be injured.
They might need our help.

05:35.568 --> 05:39.572
If they're already looking
for this ship,
isn't it best left to UNIT?

05:39.639 --> 05:41.274
What?

05:41.340 --> 05:44.544
An alien ship with
a rhinoceros for a pilot,
crash lands

05:44.610 --> 05:46.112
and you want UNIT
to have all the fun?

05:50.917 --> 05:53.486
Luke's got a point.
Do we really want to go
upsetting UNIT again?

05:53.553 --> 05:56.189
And how do we explain
that we know the ship
ejected a lifepod?

05:56.255 --> 05:58.558
They don't know about Mr Smith
and they're not going to.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.960
Plus, from what I've heard,
the Judoon aren't
all that bright.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.763
Ah, great!
A pan-galactic PC Plod!

06:03.830 --> 06:06.032
UNIT carry guns
and so do the Judoon.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.501
If you ask me,
that spells trouble.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.771
-Sarah!
-Oh! Sarah Jane.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.773
-Sorry.
GITA: Wait up!

06:13.840 --> 06:15.742
Oh, are you off out somewhere?

06:15.808 --> 06:19.011
Yes, Mum.
According to the news that
meteor came down near here.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.780
We thought we'll go
and take a look.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.615
-So we are in
a bit of a hurry.
-Oh, no problem, my darling.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.685

I'm stepping up the corporate
side of the flower shop.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.587
"Corporate side"?
Ooh, sounds fascinating.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.223
I was just wondering,
you know, with your contacts,

06:30.289 --> 06:33.626
whether you had
any suggestions,
people I could approach?

06:33.693 --> 06:36.529
My contacts? Oh, really, Gita,
my normal contacts

06:36.596 --> 06:38.765
don't usually have much
interest in flowers.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.876
Yes. Oh, Gita, why don't you
take a look at these people?

06:49.942 --> 06:51.911
A little flower power

urban renewal list for years.

07:07.426 --> 07:10.129

the Judoon's lifepod has
helped with the demolition.

best places, Sarah Jane!

07:12.665 --> 07:16.035

07:47.934 --> 07:50.136
-Oh, no!
-What is it?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.372
Remember the Judoon
are policemen?

07:53.439 --> 07:56.108
I think what crashed here was
some sort of prison carrier.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.344
And Rhino rozzer's
lost his prisoner?

07:58.411 --> 08:01.280
The Judoon's only interest
is in stopping that
creature getting away.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.882
Humans don't matter.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.517
Under the Articles of the
Shadow Proclamation,

08:04.584 --> 08:06.786
we barely exist.
Too primitive.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.188
You know, a planet could start
to get a complex.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.157
-Come on!
-Where are you going?

08:11.224 --> 08:16.195
Oh, maybe we can help him
catch his convict before
anyone else gets in his way!

08:19.866 --> 08:21.868
Oh, come on, Haresh.

Stay with Captain Tybo.

SARAH JANE: Hello?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.668
The monster...

12:49.735 --> 12:53.072
It's all right. It's gone,
it's gone now. You're safe.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.673
It...

12:54.740 --> 12:57.943
It took my mummy.

-Don't worry. Sarah Jane
will find your prisoner.

Hello? Mum?

13:02.548 --> 13:03.916
Luke.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.718
How is Captain Tybo?

13:05.784 --> 13:07.153
I think he's going
to be all right.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.155
<i>I need you and Rani</i>
<i>to keep him occupied.</i>

13:09.221 --> 13:11.323
We're over in that church hall
that we passed.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.926
Keep him out of the way
for as long as you can.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.362
We think Androvax has taken
a little girl's mum hostage.

13:16.428 --> 13:19.165
-I have to find them first.
<i>-Okay, Mum.</i>

13:19.231 --> 13:21.433
-We'll take care of it.
<i>-Stay alert.</i>

13:21.500 --> 13:23.035
Yes, we'll be careful.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.370
Bye.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.742
Mum thinks Androvax
is heading back
to the crash site.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.810
(GRUNTING)

13:35.314 --> 13:36.849
I hunt.

13:41.787 --> 13:43.222
I've had a look around.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.624
There's no sign of
Androvax or Julie's mum.

13:45.691 --> 13:49.628
I don't understand what would
a "destroyer of worlds"

13:49.695 --> 13:52.565
want with a little girl's mum.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.301
I don't know. A hostage?
Maybe something
to bargain with?

13:55.367 --> 13:58.470
Then Androvax doesn't know
Captain Tybo very well,
does he?

13:58.537 --> 14:02.208
Tybo won't let something
like a human get in the way
of his trigger finger.

14:02.274 --> 14:06.045
Which is exactly why
we have to find Androvax
before Tybo does.

14:06.111 --> 14:09.848
This isn't going to work,
Luke. Tybo's going to realise
that we're having him on.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.517
I don't know about you,

14:11.584 --> 14:13.652
but I don't think Judoon
have much of
a sense of humour.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.322
Mum just needs some time.
If Tybo catches up with
Androvax before she does,

14:16.388 --> 14:17.756
that girl's mum
won't stand a chance.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.825
If he catches on to us,
neither will we.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.430
It was a monster.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.634
It was an alien,
not a monster.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.503
Aliens, they're people,
just like us.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.640
They just look
a bit different, that's all.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.842
No! It was scary!

14:36.909 --> 14:40.012
It... It looked horrible!

14:43.349 --> 14:46.385
We probably look
pretty awful to him, too.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.587
This is a strange
place to him.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.956
I'm sure he's just
as scared as you are.

14:51.023 --> 14:55.661
Sarah Jane's right.
I reckon, he just wants
your mum to help him

14:55.728 --> 14:57.863
phone home or something.

15:00.766 --> 15:04.169
But the important thing is
you have to trust me, Julie.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.306
You have to trust me
to find your mum
and to look after you.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.241
I trust you, Sarah Jane.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.442

Leave her alone!

16:00.159 --> 16:03.162
Androvax not here.
Did not return.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.531
No trace. You lie!

16:05.597 --> 16:07.166
No! It wasn't a lie...

16:07.232 --> 16:09.468
It was a mistake.
There's a difference.
Big difference!

16:09.535 --> 16:11.704
A mistake isn't a crime.
Even to the Judoon.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.445

I suppose.

stepped inside her body.

25:39.371 --> 25:43.642
Just stop worrying.
I told you, Sarah knows
the chief executive.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.943
It's all going to be fine.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.455
They were doing what?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.659
Plants?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.627
What sort of plants?

26:05.297 --> 26:07.032
Hello again, Mr Yorke.

26:12.037 --> 26:15.307
Sonic lipstick.
Handy little toy.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.542
Especially for getting
in places I shouldn't be.

26:17.609 --> 26:20.345
-Security!
-You're wasting
your time, Mr Yorke.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.549
I've disabled the entire
Genetec communications system.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.088
Have to tell you,
it seems a pretty

26:30.155 --> 26:33.858
extreme way of continuing
our conversation, Miss Smith.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.727
I'm done talking, Mr Yorke.

26:36.861 --> 26:40.131
I want...your nanoforms.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.300
What?

26:42.367 --> 26:44.703
They're going to
build me something.

26:44.769 --> 26:49.240
Something...very special.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.742
Mr Smith, we need you!

26:54.245 --> 26:56.581
<i>Luke! Clyde! Rani! Run!</i>

26:56.648 --> 26:58.116
<i>Get out of the house, now!</i>

26:58.183 --> 27:00.552
I don't understand.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.955
<i>Sarah Jane has instructed</i>
<i>my self-detonation protocols</i>
<i>to initiate on activation.</i>

27:04.022 --> 27:07.125
<i>-I will explode in 60 seconds.</i>
-Oh, boy.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.761
<i>The explosion will destroy</i>
<i>all of Bannerman Road.</i>

27:09.828 --> 27:11.496
<i>You must run! Now!</i>

27:19.137 --> 27:20.705
(CONTINUOUS BEEPING)

27:21.973 --> 27:24.409
The nanoforms,
they're multiplying.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.112
They're responding
to my programming.

27:27.178 --> 27:30.715
The safety protocols
can't cope with that rate
of multiplication.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.486
-They'll swarm.
-I'm releasing them
to build my ship.

27:34.552 --> 27:35.754
If they get into
the environment

27:35.820 --> 27:37.756
they'll take
the whole planet apart!

27:37.822 --> 27:40.558
SARAH JANE: Do your work!

27:40.625 --> 27:43.595
Destroy... Earth!
