4 ENVELOPES

FROM THE OFFICE
OF ADMISSIONS

00:26.300 --> 00:28.100
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF PENNBROOK.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.600
YOU ROBBED
OUR MAILBOXES!

00:29.600 --> 00:31.300
HEY, IT'S
A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.734
I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.567
I'M IN. I DID IT!
I'M IN!

00:36.567 --> 00:38.300
AAH!
AAH!
YAY!

00:38.300 --> 00:39.700
HA HA!

00:42.400 --> 00:46.600
OH, WELL, I--I GUESS
NOT EVERYBODY CAN GET IN.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.133
BUT <i>I </i>DID.

00:51.133 --> 00:52.700
WHOO!
AAH!

00:52.700 --> 00:53.734
ALL RIGHT.

00:53.734 --> 00:56.000
WHY DON'T YOU
GO NOW, CORY?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.734
I'M IN! I'M IN!
THOSE IDIOTS LET ME IN!

01:00.800 --> 01:01.834
WHOO! ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.967
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE GOT ONE MORE TO GO,

01:03.967 --> 01:05.734
AND LET'S NOT LIE.
THIS IS A TOUGHIE.

01:05.734 --> 01:08.867
SHAWN, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,
I LOVE YOU.

01:08.867 --> 01:09.867
I'M READY.
OK.

01:15.667 --> 01:16.667
WAIT LIST!

01:16.667 --> 01:18.734
HA HA!
ALL RIGHT!

01:18.734 --> 01:19.734
WHAT?

01:19.734 --> 01:20.967
I'M ON THE WAIT LIST,

01:20.967 --> 01:22.400
SO IF THEY DON'T
GET FILLED UP

01:22.400 --> 01:24.967
WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT
THEY'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED,
I GET IN.

01:24.967 --> 01:28.200
BUT THE PLAN WAS
FOR ALL OF US TO GO
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.500
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA
BE FRIENDS.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.600
EVERYONE SAYS THAT.
AND THEN THEY GRADUATE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

01:33.600 --> 01:35.200
AND THEY NEVER SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.300
COULD THAT HAPPEN?

01:36.300 --> 01:37.734
I'M GETTING YOU
INTO PENNBROOK.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.300
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU GOT IN...

01:42.300 --> 01:45.000
TO NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE
COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.200
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO PENNBROOK?!

01:47.200 --> 01:48.800
THAT'S CRAZY!

01:48.800 --> 01:51.567
LOOK, EVERYBODY
IN MY FAMILY
WENT TO PENNBROOK.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.700
TOPANGA.
COULD YOU HELP US OUT
FOR A SECOND?

01:53.700 --> 01:56.734
IN YOUR OPINION,
WHICH SCHOOL IS BETTER--

01:56.734 --> 01:58.667
TURNPIKE
OR PENNBROOK?

01:58.667 --> 02:00.834
ANY SCHOOL'S
BETTER THAN PENNBROOK.
PENNBROOK'S YUCKY.

02:00.834 --> 02:03.367
AND WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THE PIKE?

02:03.367 --> 02:05.467
I WOULD NEVER
GO THERE.
AND WHY NOT?

02:05.467 --> 02:07.600
WELL, I HEAR THEY
HAVE A PROMISCUITY
PROBLEM.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.767
REALLY.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.834
YEAH. PIKE GIRLS
ARE WAY TOO EASY.

02:10.834 --> 02:12.367
THEY NEVER WANT
A COMMITMENT.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.200
YOU GO
FROM GIRL TO GIRL
EVERY DAY.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.000
TALK ABOUT SHALLOW.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.734
YOU KNOW...I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY OF THIS.
I GOTTA GO THINK.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.467
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HELPING YOU DO
THIS. I FEEL DIRTY.

02:22.467 --> 02:25.100
NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT HELPING
ME, TOPANGA.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.400
YOU'RE HELPING SHAWN.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.100
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN KICK PEOPLE
OUT OF PENNBROOK

02:28.100 --> 02:30.734
TO MAKE ROOM
FOR HIM? DO YOU KNOW
HOW CRAZY YOU ARE?

02:30.734 --> 02:33.834
BARRY! BUD. DID YOU THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

02:33.834 --> 02:36.233
THINK ABOUT IT, MAN,
I AM DOING IT.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.867
I AM TURNING DOWN
PENNBROOK

02:37.867 --> 02:39.834
AND GOING TO TAHITI
FOR 6 YEARS.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.200
BARRY,
PENNBROOK GAVE YOU
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP!

02:42.200 --> 02:45.133
YEAH. WHEN I TOLD
MY DAD, HE TOOK
A SWING AT ME.

02:45.133 --> 02:47.834
CORY, I KNOW YOU WANT
US ALL TO BE TOGETHER,

02:47.834 --> 02:49.734
BUT IF IT'S MEANT
TO HAPPEN, IT WILL.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.500
OH, IT'S MEANT
TO HAPPEN, TOPANGA,

02:51.500 --> 02:55.300
AND IF IT'S NOT MEANT
TO HAPPEN, I'LL MAKE IT
MEANT TO HAPPEN.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.900
CRAIG. HAVE YOU HEARD
ABOUT TODAY'S ARMY?

03:08.567 --> 03:10.233
I'VE CONVINCED
SO MANY PEOPLE

03:10.233 --> 03:11.467
NOT TO GO
TO PENNBROOK

03:11.467 --> 03:14.000
THAT YOU AND I
ARE GONNA BE
THE ONLY GUYS THERE.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.400
YOU'RE EXPOSING
MY PHOTOGRAPHS.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.767
HEY, IT'S DARK
IN HERE.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.100
THAT'S WHY
IT'S CALLED A DARKROOM,
COLLEGE BOY.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.600
COME ON. I'VE ONLY
BEEN HERE 3 WEEKS.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.367
YOU WANT TO GET ME
FIRED ALREADY?

03:23.367 --> 03:25.867
NO, LISTEN.
AFTER YOU GRADUATE
FROM PENNBROOK, MY FRIEND,

03:25.867 --> 03:28.133
YOUR BOSS IS GONNA
BE WORKING FOR <i>YOU. </i>

03:28.133 --> 03:30.867
COME ON. I'M JUST
ON THE WAITING LIST
FOR COLLEGE, COR.

03:30.867 --> 03:32.600
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT WAITING
FOR ANYTHING HERE.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.300
JONATHAN'S ALREADY
GOT ME DEVELOPING MY OWN
PICTURES, YOU KNOW?

03:35.300 --> 03:36.300
DOIN' GOOD.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.900
SHAWN, THIS IS
JUST A HOBBY.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.000
YOU CAN TAKE
THESE KIND OF COURSES
IN COLLEGE.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.467
I MIGHT NOT GET IN.
YOU WANT ME
TO BE SMART?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.467
I'M SMART
TO CONSIDER
OTHER OPTIONS.

03:44.467 --> 03:45.834
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS?

03:45.834 --> 03:47.100
COOL.
WHAT?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.967
MY PICTURE.
IT'S FINISHED,
AND IT'S GOOD.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.200
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:51.200 --> 03:55.400
I THINK YOU HAVEN'T
LISTENED TO A THING
I'VE SAID, SHAWN.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.100
DUCKIES!

04:11.100 --> 04:14.867
COME ON, ALAN.
IF WE PICK OUT
THE WALLPAPER TOGETHER,

04:14.867 --> 04:16.400
IT'LL BE MORE FUN.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.900
IT'S NOT FUN.
IT'S TORTURE.

04:17.900 --> 04:20.500
I'VE TOLD YOU
A THOUSAND TIMES, WOMAN,
I'M NO GOOD AT THIS.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.734
WALLPAPER IS <i>YOUR </i>BUSINESS.

04:22.734 --> 04:25.100
DUCKIES!

04:25.100 --> 04:26.300
I'M NOT DOING IT
WITHOUT YOU.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.934
IT'LL ONLY BREED
ANGER AND RESENTMENT.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.934
JUST TELL ME
WHICH ONE YOU LIKE BEST.

04:30.934 --> 04:32.033
DUCKIES.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.800
OK...

04:38.100 --> 04:39.300
THIS ONE.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.000
NO!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.500
WAS THAT DUCKIES?
NO. GARBAGE.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.667
HI, MR. AND MRS. MATTHEWS.
OOH, WALLPAPER! FUN!

04:48.667 --> 04:49.867
Alan: SO!

04:49.867 --> 04:52.734
2 WEEKS TILL GRADUATION.
HOW ARE YOU TWO HOLDING UP?

04:52.734 --> 04:54.500
IT'S EXCITING,
BUT IT'S SCARY.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.867
NO, IT'S NOT SCARY.
WHAT'S THERE
TO BE SCARED ABOUT?

04:56.867 --> 04:59.900
HEY, FOR ME IT WAS
LIKE JUMPIN' OFF A CLIFF.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.467
NOW, YOU SEE,
DUCKIES ARE GOOD

05:01.467 --> 05:03.367
BECAUSE NOT ONLY
DO THEY GIVE YOU

05:03.367 --> 05:04.934
THAT NONTHREATENING
SENSE OF SECURITY,

05:04.934 --> 05:07.567
BUT YOU CAN FEED
'EM CRACKERS AND
YOU CAN RIDE 'EM.

05:07.567 --> 05:12.000
SEE...DUCKIES
ARE THE HORSIES
OF THE OCEAN.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.233
NO. I MEAN, THEY ARE.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.400
OK, SOMEBODY EXPLAIN
TO ME ABOUT DUCKIES

05:17.400 --> 05:19.400
BEFORE I HIT HIM
WITH A SPOON.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.567
IT'S WALLPAPER.

05:20.567 --> 05:21.600
IT'S ADORABLE.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.233
IT'S FOR YOUR ROOM.
FOR MY ROOM?

05:24.233 --> 05:25.834
DUCKIES RULE!

05:27.400 --> 05:30.900
YOU SEE? I HAD DUCKIES
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.
I--I TURNED OUT FINE.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.600
IT'S FOR THE BABY.
BUT DON'T WORRY.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.400
WE WON'T RE-DUCK-ERATE
TILL YOU MOVE OUT.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.467
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:39.467 --> 05:40.967
WHO--WHO SAID
I'M MOVING OUT?

05:40.967 --> 05:44.700
I--I WILL WHEN I GO
TO COLLEGE, BUT CAN WE
SLOW DOWN FOR A SECOND?

05:44.700 --> 05:45.834
I...I SORT OF THOUGHT

05:45.834 --> 05:49.567
THAT YOU GUYS
WOULD KEEP MY ROOM
THE WAY IT IS.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.700
ACTUALLY, COR, FOR THAT,
I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE
UNEXPECTEDLY KILLED

05:51.700 --> 05:53.800
BY A TRUCK OR SOMETHING.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.200
CORY, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.000
NO. I--I KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.400
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OK,
TOPANGA. I KNOW WE'RE ALL
GONNA GO TO COLLEGE TOGETHER.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.567
WE'RE ALL GONNA LIVE
HERE IN THE SAME TOWN.

06:02.567 --> 06:05.033
WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
THE SAME JOBS.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.867
WE'RE ALL GONNA TAKE
VACATIONS TOGETHER.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.800
AND WE'RE GONNA DIE
TOGETHER AND BE BURIED
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.400
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA GO TO CHUBBIE'S

06:12.400 --> 06:14.600
TO BE IN MY
REGULAR BOOTH,
MY REGULAR PLACE,

06:14.600 --> 06:16.300
TO HAVE THE USUAL.

06:24.233 --> 06:25.500
THAT'S GOOD.
EVERYTHING'S
GETTING BETTER.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.900
I'M GETTING HAPPY.
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.300
I'M GETTING A BURGER.
EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.600
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS GOOD.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.967
TELL HIM
THE GOOD NEWS,
HONEY.

06:32.967 --> 06:36.734
NO MORE PART-TIME JOB.
MY BOSS SAYS
THAT AFTER I GRADUATE,

06:36.734 --> 06:39.700
HE WANTS ME TO BE
HIS FULL-TIME ASSISTANT.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.767
THAT'S GREAT, SHAWN!
YEAH.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.000
THAT'S THE BIG NEWS?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.200
TELL 'EM WHAT ELSE.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.033
THIS CAME IN THE MAIL
TODAY.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.367
YES!
IS IT
FROM PENNBROOK?

06:48.367 --> 06:49.734
YES! YOU DID IT!
YOU'RE IN!

06:49.734 --> 06:51.500
WE ARE ALL
TOGETHER FOREVER.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.200
WELL, WAIT. LET'S
NOT GET CARRIED AWAY.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.867
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN THE LETTER.

06:54.867 --> 06:56.700
NO, NO, NO.
I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS

06:56.700 --> 06:59.500
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT IT HAS TO SAY.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.033
"IT IS OUR PLEASURE
TO INFORM YOU

07:03.033 --> 07:05.867
"THAT DUE TO OUR LATEST
ENROLLMENT FIGURES, YOU HAVE
BEEN MOVED OFF THE WAIT LIST

07:05.867 --> 07:08.734
AND ARE OFFICIALLY
ACCEPTED INTO PENNBROOK
UNIVERSITY."

07:08.734 --> 07:11.934
YES! THE ENROLLMENT FIGURES.
THAT WAS ME. I FIXED 'EM.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.200
THAT WAS ME.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.200
OH, GOD, I AM
SO PROUD OF YOU.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.400
THANKS.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.967
SHE MEANT SHAWN.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.367
WHAT'D <i>HE </i>DO?

07:22.367 --> 07:25.367
WOW. I DID IT.
I ACTUALLY GOT
INTO COLLEGE.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.100
THIS IS A BIG DAY.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.500
THIS IS THE BIGGEST
DAY, SHAWN.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.934
SEE, TOPANGA,
I TOLD YOU.

07:29.934 --> 07:31.367
EVERYTHING IS
GONNA WORK OUT.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
CAN I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION FOR A SECOND?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.734
MY BEST FRIEND--
SHAWN HUNTER--

07:36.734 --> 07:38.734
I THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE THE JOB.

07:38.734 --> 07:42.000
IS THROWING AWAY
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.033
I'M JUST SAYING
I NEED TIME TO THINK.

07:49.033 --> 07:53.400
NO THINKING. BARRY
IS ON HIS WAY TO TAHITI
BECAUSE OF YOU.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.867
YOU ARE GOING
TO COLLEGE.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.000
YOU'RE NOT
MY FATHER, CORY.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.200
IF I WAS
YOUR FATHER, SHAWN,
I'D SPANK YOU!

07:59.200 --> 08:02.467
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU DESERVE!
A BIG SPANKING!

08:02.467 --> 08:05.200
NOW, TAKE DOWN
YOUR PANTS!

08:06.300 --> 08:08.400
TOPANGA
HAS SOME NEWS.
RIGHT, TOPANGA?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.934
THIS IS PROBABLY
A BAD TIME.

08:09.934 --> 08:11.500
TOPANGA
GOT A LETTER
FROM YALE.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
IF YOU DON'T
GO TO PENNBROOK,
WE ARE FINISHED.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.000
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF YALE ACCEPTED ME YET.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
I WAS TALKING
TO SHAWN. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.500
GO AHEAD.
OPEN IT.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.200
I APPLIED TO YALE
WHEN CORY AND I
BROKE UP.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.500
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE
A REAL FUTURE HERE...

08:23.500 --> 08:25.967
NOT BECAUSE I REALLY
WANTED TO GO. I JUST WANTED
TO SEE IF I COULD GET IN.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.300
TO GET THE KIND
OF EDUCATION WHERE
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TALK

08:28.300 --> 08:31.200
ABOUT EXHAUST MANIFOLDS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.600
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WITH
MY GPA BEING SO HIGH

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
AND MY BOARDS BEING
SO, WELL, HIGH...

08:34.600 --> 08:37.500
YOU DESERVE MORE, SHAWN,
OK? GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.867
GIVE ME THAT.
HERE'S YOUR FOOD.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.400
NOT HUNGRY.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.100
NOT MY PROBLEM.
STILL HAVE TO PAY.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.000
SHAWN.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.600
I--I NEED TIME
TO THINK, COR.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.967
YOU MADE
THE WAIT LIST, KID.
NICE GOING.

08:48.967 --> 08:52.500
I THINK I'LL GIVE
THE CHECK TO...

08:52.500 --> 08:53.734
YOU.

08:55.867 --> 08:58.834
GEE. I REALLY THOUGHT
I'D GET IN.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.200
CORY, I FEEL AWFUL.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.100
<i>YOU </i>FEEL AWFUL?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.400
ABOUT WHAT?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.700
NOT GETTING
INTO YALE.

09:04.700 --> 09:08.600
YALE? SHAWN COULD NEVER
GET INTO YALE.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.767
I MEAN, <i>YOU </i>COULD
HARDLY GET INTO YALE.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.400
WHAT?

09:20.700 --> 09:23.100
WHAT IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
IN A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.133
EDUCATION.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.200
AND WHAT IS SHAWN
ABOUT TO DO?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.600
STOP HIS EDUCATION.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.900
AND IT'S YOUR JOB AS
SHAWN'S OLDER BROTHER
TO WHAT?

09:28.900 --> 09:30.667
FIX THIS?
WHY?

09:30.667 --> 09:35.200
BECAUSE...HE KNOWS ALL YOUR
TRICKS AND HE'S SICK AND
TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOU.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.467
NOW, GO GET HIM.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.667
OK. WHAT
DO WE GOT?

09:37.667 --> 09:39.367
YOU'VE GOT THE NIKON
LOADED WITH TRI-X,

09:39.367 --> 09:41.033
AND THE HASSELBLAD'S
READY FOR THE CLOSEUPS.

09:41.033 --> 09:43.100
MMM. PERFECT, SHAWN.
YOU'RE LEARNING FAST.
KEEP THIS UP,

09:43.100 --> 09:46.100
I'M GONNA BE
WORKING FOR <i>YOU. </i>

09:46.100 --> 09:48.500
I'LL GET TO YOU
IN A SECOND.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.200
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE
IS EDUCATION.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.600
NOW, AS SHAWN'S
OLDER BROTHER,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.834
I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY
AND WATCH HIM THROW
HIS LIFE AWAY.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.233
I APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR HIM,

09:56.233 --> 09:58.300
BUT HE'S YOUNG
AND IMPRESSIONABLE,
AND I'M NOT.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.700
HAVE YOU
EVER MODELED?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.500
NO. WHY DO YOU ASK?

10:07.367 --> 10:08.367
[CLICK]

10:08.367 --> 10:10.800
YES! YES!
GOOD! GOOD! GOOD!
[CLICK]

10:10.800 --> 10:11.800
OHH!

10:11.800 --> 10:13.200
NOW.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.000
WISTFUL.

10:17.567 --> 10:21.133
OHH. YOU HAVE DONE THIS.
YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE!

10:21.133 --> 10:22.467
[CLICK]
PERFECT!

10:22.467 --> 10:25.200
THANKS
FOR BRINGING ME
THIS GUY. HE'S GOLD.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.600
DO YOU DO ANGST?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
[CLICK]

10:29.300 --> 10:31.834
EXCELLENT!
SHAWN, GO SEE
IF TERRI'S READY.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.900
RIGHT AWAY.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.033
SHAWN. SHAWN. LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

10:36.033 --> 10:39.300
AS YOUR FRIEND...
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND,

10:39.300 --> 10:41.367
JUST TELL ME WHY
YOU WOULD CONSIDER

10:41.367 --> 10:43.300
GIVING UP EVERYTHING
FOR THIS.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.734
HOW DO I LOOK,
SHAWN?

10:44.734 --> 10:46.867
UH...COME
HERE, TERRI.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.100
PERFECT.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.867
YOU'RE THE BEST.

10:51.867 --> 10:52.867
STOP.

10:52.867 --> 10:53.967
[CHUCKLES]

10:53.967 --> 10:55.834
I'M WAITING
FOR AN ANSWER.

10:55.834 --> 10:58.500
CORY...I LIKE
WORKING HERE,
AND I'M GOOD AT IT.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.800
YOU KNOW?
THEY TREAT ME
WITH RESPECT.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.467
I MAKE
A GOOD PAYCHECK.

11:02.467 --> 11:03.800
AND I'M LEARNING
A LOT.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.934
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
I CAN'T WAIT FOR
SCHOOL TO BE OVER

11:06.934 --> 11:08.867
SO I CAN COME HERE
AND LEARN MORE.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.700
I'VE NEVER FELT THAT WAY
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL,

11:10.700 --> 11:13.834
SO I'M SURE I'M NOT
GONNA FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT COLLEGE.

11:13.834 --> 11:16.300
I'VE FOUND SOMETHING
HERE, COR.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.200
WELL, YOU SOUND
LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY
MADE YOUR DECISION.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.834
YEAH.

11:23.834 --> 11:25.667
I HAVE.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.934
BUT THANKS
FOR THE ADVICE.

11:27.934 --> 11:31.400
YOU KNOW, I'M
NOT GONNA GIVE UP
ON THIS, SHAWN.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.400
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.967
WHAT AM I GOING
TO COLLEGE FOR?

11:35.967 --> 11:37.667
TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION,
TO GET A GOOD JOB,
TO MAKE GOOD MONEY,

11:37.667 --> 11:40.600
TO GET ONE GIRL
TO HANG ALL OVER ME
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.900
AND HERE I HAVE TWO.
I'M STAYING.

11:47.734 --> 11:48.867
WHAT ARE YOU DO--

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
I HAVE
A DOORBELL.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.367
[DING]

12:09.700 --> 12:10.867
YES?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
YOU'RE MY LAST HOPE.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO SHAWN.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.767
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE
WITH HIM.

12:18.767 --> 12:20.800
OH, THANK YOU.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.967
I TOLD SHAWN
I SUPPORT HIS DECISION.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.133
YOU WHAT?!

12:27.200 --> 12:28.400
I GAVE HIM MY BLESSING.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.100
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE POPE?

12:31.100 --> 12:34.200
MR. FEENY, SHAWN AND I
ARE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO COLLEGE TOGETHER.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.567
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ROOMMATES.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.600
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THINGS CHANGE,

12:38.600 --> 12:41.367
AND NOT
JUST FOR STUDENTS.

12:41.367 --> 12:44.767
YOU KNOW...WHY CAN'T
YOU EVER JUST SAY
WHAT YOU MEAN?

12:44.767 --> 12:47.100
WHY DOES
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY

12:47.100 --> 12:49.300
HAVE TO HAVE
SOME HIDDEN EXPLANATION?

12:49.300 --> 12:51.000
CORY.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.567
CORY, I'M RETIRING.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

12:56.300 --> 12:59.567
WELL, THE SCHOOL BOARD
IS OFFERING EARLY RETIREMENT,

12:59.567 --> 13:01.934
AND I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE IT.

13:01.934 --> 13:05.100
BUT MR. FEENY,
YOU LOVE TEACHING.

13:05.100 --> 13:09.834
WITHOUT TEACHING,
YOU'RE NOT MR. FEENY.

13:09.834 --> 13:15.400
YOU'RE JUST...
CRAZY GEORGE,
THE GUY NEXT DOOR.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.500
THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN MAKING A CHANGE
FEELS RIGHT.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.767
I'M THINKING ABOUT MOVING
TO JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.767
I'LL SPEND MY TIME
READING, FISHING.

13:24.767 --> 13:29.900
WHO KNOWS, I MIGHT
EVEN BECOME CRAZY GEORGE
OF JACKSON HOLE.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.133
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.900
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT
DID YOU GUYS, ALL DO?

13:34.900 --> 13:38.767
DID YOU ALL GET
TOGETHER AND DECIDE
TO RUIN MY LIFE?

13:38.767 --> 13:39.834
CORY.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.867
EVERYTHING
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.967
HI.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.967
I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.734
THIS CAME FROM YALE.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.767
DEAR CORY,

14:02.767 --> 14:05.767
THE IVY LEAGUE
IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

14:05.767 --> 14:08.800
THE FURTHER DISINTEGRATION
OF YOUR WORLD.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.767
CONGRATULATIONS, TOPANGA.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.600
I MEAN THAT.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.834
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS ACCEPTED?

14:21.834 --> 14:25.100
BECAUSE I KNOW THE WAY
MY LIFE WORKS.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.233
MOM AND DAD SENT ME OUT
TO SEE IF YOU WERE OK.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.000
ARE YOU?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
WELL,
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.100
HOW ABOUT YOU?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.500
I'VE BEEN BETTER, TOO.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.600
I GOT A 67
ON MY HISTORY TEST.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.133
LISTEN, MORGAN,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
DO ANYTHING SILLY,

15:03.133 --> 15:07.500
LIKE NOT GO
TO COLLEGE AND
GET A JOB, ARE YOU?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.000
NO.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.967
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE A BABY,
OR GO TO YALE,

15:13.967 --> 15:15.834
OR RETIRE
TO WYOMING?

15:15.834 --> 15:18.567
I'M STILL
A LITTLE GIRL, CORY.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.567
GOD BLESS YOU.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.133
YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN
MY BOOTH SINCE BEFORE
YOU WERE BORN, MORGAN.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.934
IN FACT, I WAS SITTING
IN THIS VERY BOOTH

15:30.934 --> 15:32.734
WHEN THEY TOLD ME
I HAD A BABY SISTER.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.700
SO THIS PLACE MEANS
A LOT TO YOU, HUH?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.233
IT'S THE LAST PLACE LEFT
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.967
CORY, YOU'RE GOING CRAZY.

15:38.967 --> 15:42.033
NO, NO, NO. THE WORLD
IS GOING CRAZY, MORGAN.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.400
EVERYTHING IS
CHANGING SO FAST

15:44.400 --> 15:46.900
THAT I JUST WANT TO BE
IN THE ONE PLACE
I CAN COUNT ON

15:46.900 --> 15:50.300
WITH THE ONE PERSON
I CAN COUNT ON:
YOU, MORGAN.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.934
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU, TOO, CORY.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.367
AHOY, MATEYS!

15:55.367 --> 15:56.367
AND NOW IT'S OVER.

15:56.367 --> 15:57.867
WHAT'LL IT BE?

15:57.867 --> 16:01.467
WE'LL HAVE 2 CHUBBIE
BURGERS, 2 FRIES,
AND 2 ROOT BEERS.

16:01.467 --> 16:05.400
2 BUCCANEER BURGERS,
2 TREASURE TATERS,
AND 2 ROOT BEERS.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.200
WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.133
AND, MARIA,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

16:10.133 --> 16:11.133
PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM.

16:11.133 --> 16:12.200
OH, MY GOSH,
YOU DON'T KNOW.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
DON'T KNOW WHAT?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.000
EVERYTHING'S
CHANGED.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.200
CHUBBIE.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.200
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR OVER 3 HOURS.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.667
CHUBBIE!

16:32.667 --> 16:34.700
HE MOVED TO
JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.700
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.400
OH, COULD YOU AT LEAST
SCOOT OVER TO
THIS BARREL OVER HERE

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
WHILE THE WORKERS
PIRATIZE YOUR BOOTH?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.300
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.200
LIKE IT WOULD TAKE
JUST A FEW SECONDS
TO CHANGE A BOOTH

16:45.200 --> 16:48.734
WHERE MY GIRLFRIEND
AND I REUNITED
8 DIFFERENT TIMES.

16:48.734 --> 16:51.233
TO CHANGE A BOOTH
WHERE MY BEST FRIEND
SHAWN AND I

16:51.233 --> 16:53.734
DRESSED UP LIKE
WOMEN TO PROVE A
POINT OR SOMETHING,

16:53.734 --> 16:54.767
I FORGET.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.767
SO I DOUBT
VERY MUCH, MISSY,

16:56.767 --> 16:58.934
THAT YOU CAN CHANGE
THAT MUCH HISTORY

16:58.934 --> 17:01.200
IN JUST
A FEW SECONDS.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.100
WRONG AGAIN.

17:08.100 --> 17:11.600
SO WHERE IS
THE LITTLE GUY? AH.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.467
MORGAN, I ASK YOU
TO GET HELP
AND YOU BRING HIM?

17:14.467 --> 17:17.900
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU WERE ACTING LIKE A PSYCHO.

17:17.900 --> 17:22.500
HEY, IT'S ABOUT TIME
THIS PLACE GOT SOME CLASS.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.367
ANYBODY WANT TO SPLIT A
COUPLE OF BUCCANEER BURGERS?

17:26.467 --> 17:29.767
OH, I GET IT.
IT'S PIRATES.

17:29.767 --> 17:32.767
YOU KNOW, ERIC,
I JUST--
I'VE WORKED SO HARD

17:32.767 --> 17:34.667
AND SO LONG TO KEEP
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.567
YOU KNOW, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO, JUST
SIT HERE, SMILE,

17:37.567 --> 17:41.100
EAT A BUCCANEER
BURGER, AND PRETEND
EVERYTHING'S OK?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.400
YOU'RE SCARED
OF CHANGE, HUH?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.133
YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH
THAT SAME THING

17:44.133 --> 17:45.600
WHEN I FIRST GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

17:45.600 --> 17:48.300
BUT THAT'S WHY I TOOK
A YEAR OFF BEFORE
I WENT TO COLLEGE.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.600
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE GRADES
TO GET INTO COLLEGE.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.000
I'M TALKING
HERE.

17:53.033 --> 17:54.233
SIT DOWN.

17:56.834 --> 18:00.100
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING
TO YOUR FRIENDS, CORY,

18:00.100 --> 18:03.600
AND YOU NEED TO BE
HAPPY FOR THEM...

18:04.667 --> 18:06.133
OR ELSE WHAT KIND
OF FRIEND ARE YOU?

18:06.133 --> 18:11.100
OK, MATEY,
YOU'RE THE FIRST
TO WALK THE PLANK.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.967
LET ME KNOW
HOW IT IS.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.600
YOU KNOW, IF I TAKE
A BITE OF THIS,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.500
IT'S LIKE CHUBBIE'S
IS JUST A MEMORY.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.200
IT'S LIKE
EVERYTHING'S
CHANGING...

18:20.200 --> 18:22.300
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.900
JUST TASTE IT.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.033
OH, NO. IT'S GOOD.

18:31.734 --> 18:34.300
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO CHUBBIE'S?

18:34.300 --> 18:38.033
WELL, GUYS, IT'S NOT
CHUBBIE'S ANYMORE.
IT'S PEG LEG PETE'S.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.900
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT--

18:40.900 --> 18:42.867
NEVER MIND.
HERE, JACK.

18:42.867 --> 18:46.300
OH, NO, NO, NO. I HAVE
A MODELING CAREER NOW.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.734
BEEF GOES RIGHT
TO THE HIPS.

18:48.734 --> 18:50.600
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
WE NEED TO TALK.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
COREY, ABOUT
THE LETTER FROM YALE...

18:54.600 --> 18:56.867
I WAS JUST REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT GETTING ACCEPTED,

18:56.867 --> 19:00.934
BUT, I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU, CORY.

19:00.934 --> 19:02.100
TOPANGA, I WANT TO
BE WITH YOU, TOO.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.033
BUT THIS IS YALE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,
YOU KNOW.

19:04.033 --> 19:06.600
YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE THAT UP.

19:07.667 --> 19:08.667
AND I ACCEPT THAT.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.200
GOOD FOR YOU, CORY.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.600
BUT CORY,
YALE'S IN--

19:12.600 --> 19:15.500
I DON'T CARE IF YALE
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MOON.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.100
NOTHING IS GOING
TO KEEP US APART.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.600
AND SHAWN...

19:21.667 --> 19:22.800
I STILL THINK
YOU'RE MAKING

19:22.800 --> 19:25.300
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.233
BUT I ACCEPT IT.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.767
THANKS, CORY. I'LL TRY
TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.500
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF CHANGES
IN YOUR LIFE, CORY.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.667
IT'S NOT THE CHANGES
THAT MATTER,

19:35.667 --> 19:37.400
IT'S HOW YOU REACT
TO THE CHANGES.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.133
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
MAKES YOU WHO YOU ARE.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.000
THEN I EVEN ACCEPT
THAT FEENY'S
RETIRING.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.467
WHAAAT?!

19:44.767 --> 19:46.900
HE'S MOVING TO
JACKSON HOLE.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.033
HERE IN PHILADELPHIA?

19:49.033 --> 19:50.033
NO, IN HAWAII,

19:50.033 --> 19:53.200
YOU INCREDIBLE,
UNBELIEVABLE MORON.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.934
FEENY CAN'T DO THAT.
HOW CAN FEENY DO THAT,

19:54.934 --> 19:58.800
I MEAN,
I NEED HIM. HE'S MY MENTOR.
I GO TO HIM FOR EVERYTHING.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.800
HMM.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.233
WHY ARE YOU NOT
MORE UPSET ABOUT THIS?

20:03.233 --> 20:05.800
HEY, THINGS
CHANGE.

20:12.867 --> 20:16.100
MR. FEENY! DUUUDE!

20:16.100 --> 20:20.667
REGRETTING THIS
IMMEDIATELY, WHAT?

20:20.667 --> 20:25.400
THERE'S A GNARLY CURL, BRA.
LET'S GO GET TUBED.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.200
ALL RIGHT,
HERE I GO.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.867
SO, WHAT'S WITH
THE BITCHIN'
BOARD, BRO?

20:30.867 --> 20:32.734
HEY, I'M COMING WITH
YOU TO JACKSON HOLE,

20:32.734 --> 20:34.200
SURFING CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.033
COME ON, GRAB YOUR STICK.
LET'S JAM.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.600
ERIC, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHERE
JACKSON HOLE IS?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.100
SURE DO. HAWAII.

20:43.667 --> 20:48.567
IT'S IN WYOMING,
YOU MACADAMIA NUT.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.500
DO THEY SURF IN WYOMING,
MR. FEENY?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.667
NO, MR. MATTHEWS,
THEY DON'T.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.500
WELL, WHAT DO THEY
DO IN THIS WYOMING?

20:58.100 --> 21:03.400
WELL, THEY TAKE THE
TIME TO ENJOY GOD'S
BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE.

21:03.400 --> 21:08.367
THEY STOP TO
APPRECIATE THEIR
QUIET SURROUNDINGS

21:08.367 --> 21:12.467
AND CONTEMPLATE
ON WHAT LIFE
IS ALL ABOUT.

21:13.467 --> 21:16.400
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A NICE PLACE.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.767
YES, IT IS.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.500
MR. FEENY?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.567
HMM?

21:21.567 --> 21:24.300
IF I'M REALLY,
REALLY QUIET,

21:24.300 --> 21:26.300
WILL YOU STAY?
