WEBVTT

00:11.579 --> 00:12.880
They're all in there.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.915
Eight total.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.550
Been about an hour now.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.152
Hope they brought donuts.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.953
Clocked a 12-gauge
behind the bar last night.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.423
Spotted a few nines
and a MAC-10
on their way in just now.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.358
Just don't give them
the chance to pull.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.775
Did you hear that?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.619
Adam-228. I have a shooting
at Mansion on the Hill.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.756
Patrol's got
the entrance blocked off.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.057
Waiting for us to engage.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.628
Boys, this bar
is a Smiling Jackal
biker stronghold.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.496
They've been involved in three
shoot-'em-ups this week.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.332
Don't know why they're
trying to kill each other.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.500
Won't keep them
from trying to kill us.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.305
Go! Move it!

01:11.372 --> 01:13.006
Come on, man.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.748
SAVOY:
Leave the bags! Leave it!

01:20.814 --> 01:21.815
Move it!

01:23.384 --> 01:24.952
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:25.018 --> 01:26.454
There's a back door.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.931
Leg day's over, boys.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.700
Team just got
pulled off standby.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.835
I'm at 7.54 miles.
What about you?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.805
7.48, but I was saving it
for the stretch run.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.640
You know I got an extra
gear after 30 minutes.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.876
Yeah, excuses are
for losers, buddy.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.413
Mumford's unit just responded
to a gang shootout in Burbank.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.847
One of the dead shooters
has been ID'd

01:53.914 --> 01:55.683
as a member
of the Montrose Merc Crew.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.718
Small-time meth dealers
out of North Hollywood.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.520
I thought Mercs played
nice with other crews.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.522
Kept their little corner.
Stayed out of everyone
else's way.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.191
Well, that used
to be their rep,

02:03.257 --> 02:05.193
but this is the third
Merc attack on Jackals
in the past week.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.827
Why are they
stirring the pot now?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.229
That's what we
need to find out.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.663
DEACON: The sarge
from my old patrol days,

02:09.730 --> 02:11.365
Sam Hawkins,
he might be of some help.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.167
When I went S.W.A.T.,
he was undercover
for a long time,

02:13.234 --> 02:14.402
mostly with the Mercs.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.003
He did a solid
three years with them.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.438
If anyone knows anything
about 'em, he will.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.006
Sounds like a visit
worth paying.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.874
Three of the shooters
from this morning
are still hiding

02:20.941 --> 02:22.343
in the neighborhood
behind the bar.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.944
Mumford's team
set up a perimeter,

02:24.011 --> 02:26.280
but they could use
extra bodies to direct
the local police.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.216
All right, Street and Tan,
get over there.
Chris and Luca,

02:28.282 --> 02:30.818
start pulling every Jackal
and Merc file we have.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.054
Deac, I'm gonna suit up
and then we'll go talk
to your friend.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.924
Looks like it's leg day,
after all.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.594
Big day. Your first
S.W.A.T. recruit class
as an evaluator.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.363
No pressure.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.199
Hope I'm here
when Hicks has their names
put up on the board.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.368
CHRIS: Erica, how are you
feeling about today?

02:47.435 --> 02:50.003
I'm doing a ten-mile jog
to keep my mind off it.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.005
CHRIS: Congrats on finishing
S.W.A.T. Academy.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.341
Seventy started,
ten survived.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.643
Yeah. Still only five spots
available on teams right now.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.246
Yup. I heard you finished
top three on every test.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.614
Yeah. Won't matter much
unless Hicks puts my picture
up there.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.083
I can't stand another second
in front of this blank screen,

03:03.150 --> 03:04.852
so... It's good
to see you, Chris.
CHRIS: Yeah.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.820
Thank you for everything.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.660
Does she really have
nothing to worry about?

03:12.726 --> 03:15.095
You know those
other evaluators,
always looking for an excuse.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.465
Hey, I made a promise
that I'd fight for the best.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.268
Erica, she's the best.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.305
DEACON: When Hawkins
likes to get away,

03:24.372 --> 03:25.739
he really gets away.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.040
You don't have to tell me.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.276
That corner store
we just passed

03:28.342 --> 03:30.077
was advertising half off
turkey gizzards.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.945
I mean, I'm just saying.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.347
What was your relationship
with this guy?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.882
Well, he was
my commanding officer.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.317
Took a liking to me.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.619
He always talked about
retiring and spending
as much time

03:38.686 --> 03:39.953
as he could up here.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.289
I'm glad
he's finally doing it.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.691
Okay, why is every
white cop's dream
of retirement

03:43.757 --> 03:45.225
being around as few people
as possible?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.494
I mean, come on now.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.161
I might like this
for about a week,

03:48.228 --> 03:49.930
but then I'd be bored
off my ass.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.533
When was the last time
you talked to him?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.967
A few years ago.
He... He was looking

03:54.034 --> 03:56.537
for some intel on some
gun runners that S.W.A.T.
had busted.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.539
You got to love
undercover work to do it
as long as he did it.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.074
I'm not sure it's where
he saw his career going,
but he was good at it.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.776
The Mercs was his last gig.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.613
He got charges to stick on
most of their top leaders.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.382
It seems like they
never recovered.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.150
Well, they're pretty
frisky right now.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.719
Let's hope he's
still plugged in.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.921
Hold on. Pavement's ending.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.968
You want to reconsider
your retirement?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.270
Just me and the birds, huh?

04:30.338 --> 04:31.705
Hell no. I'm cool.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.809
Hey, Hawkins.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.347
See? Only white folks
leave their doors open.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.881
Not at an ex-cop's place.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.422
Hawkins, you there?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.597
Out hunting?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.066
DEACON:
Nah, stove's on.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.135
His gear duffel's there.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.804
Deer drag hanging
on the wall.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.375
But his gun's missing.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.377
Looks like he might've
cleared out of here
in a hurry.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.211
Yeah, but his pickup truck's
out front.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.081
If he hightailed it
out of here,
he was on foot.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.249
This doesn't feel right.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.085
I'm gonna call it in.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.489
Yeah. No service.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.256
Gonna use the radio.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.931
Deacon, get down!

05:40.273 --> 05:41.341
Get in here, Deac!

06:42.069 --> 06:44.472
Someone must've been
sitting on the cabin,
waiting on your buddy.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.973
Mercs maybe?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.608
We got to grab
whatever supplies
we can and get out.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.643
No. If we don't act now,

06:49.710 --> 06:51.879
they're gonna
surround the cabin
and just pick us off.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.828
Deac, get over here!
We got to go!

07:07.895 --> 07:09.763
Those things
are gonna pop off!
Go! Get out of here!

07:09.830 --> 07:12.533
Get down! Get down!
Go!

07:31.685 --> 07:32.886
HONDO: Go, go.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.730
I'm still topped off.
I got 24 rounds.
What do you got?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.533
I got a few left
in mine and...
And I got a backup eight.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.367
What else are we working with?
Well, no radios,

07:47.434 --> 07:48.602
no cell service, no vests.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.105
We need a plan.
We need a plan.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.607
We needed a plan
back at the cabin.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.411
I'm just worried
about Hawkins.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.682
I think you're right.
If the Mercs are brave enough
to go after the Jackals,

08:01.749 --> 08:03.951
who's to say
they don't go after the cop
that put half their crew away?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.419
They wouldn't have been
setting up for an ambush
if they already had him.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.055
He's probably out here
somewhere.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.090
Managed to grab
some stuff from the cabin
before we got out.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.258
Might come in handy.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.060
Flare gun.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.095
Only one left. Last resort.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.699
If Hawkins is hiding
from these guys,

08:18.766 --> 08:22.069
there's a good chance that
he's in his hunting blind.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.204
We find that, we find him.
And how do we do that?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.543
Trail markers.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.044
Every woodsman knows
where to leave 'em

08:31.111 --> 08:32.512
and how to look for 'em.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.614
Oh, so you're a woodsman now?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.515
Spent every summer
camping with my dad.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.752
Let's move.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.320
STREET: Did you see
Erica Rogers this morning?

08:41.622 --> 08:43.390
Girl was bouncing
off the walls.

08:43.456 --> 08:47.094
Night before my graduation
I kept replaying

08:47.160 --> 08:49.162
my rifle qual
on week two.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.599
Tightened up on everything
after 50 yards.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.933
Finished fourth.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.935
Anything was gonna keep me
off the team, it was that.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.070
Ah, that sounds hard, man.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.772
Was top of my
class every week,

08:58.839 --> 09:01.074
so didn't have anything
to worry about.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.710
Yeah. Must've been tough
down in Long Beach

09:02.776 --> 09:04.812
competing with the guys
who didn't make it up here.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.083
Something's got him riled up
back there.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.986
Hey. Come here, buddy.
Hey, come here.

09:13.821 --> 09:14.822
Is this where you live?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.724
Huh?
Is he hurt?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.025
There's blood on his paw.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.628
It's not his.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.830
Street, check this out.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.998
STREET:
26-David to 50-David.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.400
Following a blood trail
at our location.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.647
Hands!
STREET: Let me
see the hands!

09:44.551 --> 09:46.654
This is 25-David.
We got a dead suspect.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.521
That's the Merc
Mumford hit.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.090
They must've hid him
after he bled out.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.325
Which means they
must've been in a rush.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.396
If I was gonna pick
somewhere nearby to hide...

09:56.463 --> 09:57.798
See that high
window by the roof

09:57.865 --> 10:00.968
with the drain pipes
leading up to it?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.936
Mumford, they're here.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.208
Choppers are gone.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.410
You think they gave up?

10:10.477 --> 10:12.212
Safe to head out?
We should wait another hour.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.483
L.A.P.D.! L.A.P.D.!
Let me see your hands!

10:16.549 --> 10:18.218
Don't move.
Go hands-on!
Go hands-on!

10:24.725 --> 10:26.293
STREET: What's this?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.202
It's a hit list.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.480
Drop it!
HONDO: Drop it now.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.985
You mind telling your buddy
I'm one of the good guys?

10:52.052 --> 10:54.387
Hondo, this is Hawkins.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.190
Deacon, damn. What the
hell are you doing here?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.459
We're looking for you.
We just came from your cabin.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.829
The one with a squad
of Merc shooters
camped out front?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.296
They came after you, too?

11:03.363 --> 11:05.365
Two of them tried to get the
jump on me about an hour ago.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.035
I managed to
sneak around back,
get some cover.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.070
I thought you
were one of them,
on my trail.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.604
No, they ambushed us.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.873
They ripped your place apart.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.641
That's the least
of my worries now.

11:16.443 --> 11:20.380
I was gonna wait till dark,
make my move,

11:20.447 --> 11:24.117
but now, with you two here,
maybe we can make it
to the Ranger station.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.652
There's a radio there.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.922
You guys could call
your S.W.A.T. pals,
have them pick us up.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.390
Why are the Mercs after you?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.625
And why are they
starting wars with crews
five times their size?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.461
I almost crippled them
a couple years back.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.129
I put their leaders
behind bars.

11:36.196 --> 11:41.434
My head's probably a trophy
some punk thinks he needs
to rally the troops.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.171
The Mercs were always
followers, anyway.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.910
Station's this way.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.544
Guns up, boys,
they could be anywhere.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.696
CHRIS: You didn't
select Erica Rogers?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.164
CORTEZ:
Chris, uh, not now.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.133
That woman crushed the guys
that she was competing with.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.002
She finished first
in the climbing course,

12:15.068 --> 12:18.438
she scored one second flat
on the move in her sidearms
and Benelli quals.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.607
And she doesn't get a spot
because you're all
afraid of what?

12:20.673 --> 12:22.742
More qualified women
might try out now?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.378
I only see four names.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.180
Picking no one was better
than picking her?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.349
Officer Alonso, that's...
Captain.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.351
It's okay.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.553
Not that it's any
of your business, Officer,

12:33.620 --> 12:36.689
but a red flag
from Rogers' time
working with the 77th

12:36.756 --> 12:37.891
has come to our attention.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.459
We're investigating
the matter,

12:39.526 --> 12:42.629
and when we're satisfied,
we'll pick a fifth recruit
for a team then.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.632
Now, you wouldn't want us
to give Ms. Rogers
special treatment either way.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.203
Do you?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.573
Those scores are
for the evaluation team only,
Officer Luca.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.542
Not to be shared
with anyone else.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.277
Twenty years
on the committee.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.579
Not once did I ever have
to remind your father of that.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.515
I...
Not another word.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.920
That's not cool.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.063
Don't bother.
You can't make a call
anywhere in these hills.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.666
No service, no roads, no life.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.468
Don't worry,
Ranger station's not far.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.570
DEACON: So how long you been
out, about six months?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.672
Best decision of my life, man.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.007
I should have
never let the brass

13:27.074 --> 13:28.475
keep me under
as long as they did.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.244
How about you? It's got
to be what, now, 20

13:32.279 --> 13:33.780
Still 30-David, actually.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.249
Hondo's team leader.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.752
Huh.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.555
I think I prefer gang politics
to police politics.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.925
Less feelings.
We were hoping
that your knowledge

13:44.992 --> 13:48.395
of the Mercs could
help us understand
what's motivating them.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.097
Motivated by the same thing
they always are.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.364
Control, power.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.565
In fact,
it doesn't surprise me

13:52.632 --> 13:54.234
that they took
a swing at the Jackals.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.170
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.709
We never told you
it was the Jackals
the Mercs were targeting.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.750
Now!
Cover! Cover!

14:10.817 --> 14:12.252
Deac, go, go!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.190
Come on, come on!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.532
HONDO: We got to go.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.074
Deacon!

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
One of my guys saw
your car pull up.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.752
I was hoping it was nothing.

14:45.818 --> 14:49.122
I would've never
given the order to fire
if I knew it was you, Deac.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.224
I really hate
that it went this way.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.028
Deacon?

15:05.305 --> 15:06.940
HAWKINS:
They went this way.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.475
And one of them is injured.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.945
Now, listen, listen,
be careful. These guys
are really, really good.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.147
But there's two of them
and there's ten of us.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.583
Plus, we've got better weapons
and communications.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.885
Just don't let them
get to civilization.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.657
Deac.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.194
Hold up, man.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.428
All right, that's far enough.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.064
I think we've bought
a few minutes.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.432
Let me take a look
at that wound.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.768
I counted nine, plus Hawkins.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.971
Those HKs were
the same as we use.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.007
Hawkins got a hookup
or something?
He could.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.674
He seems to be running
the whole crew.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.678
Oh, man.
I hit a branch
on the way down.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.847
You're gonna have
to settle for conversation
as anesthetic.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.589
Hawkins was
my commanding officer
for five years.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.394
You know how many beers
I had with the guy?

16:01.461 --> 16:04.031
How could I not suspect...
Deac, stop it.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.667
Whether he lost his way, or
he was always capable of this,

16:07.734 --> 16:09.169
Hawkins decided
to switch teams.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.537
Yeah, but how did
it get to that?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.275
S.W.A.T. protocol has Dispatch
check in every two hours.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.177
That's in ten minutes.
Right, when they don't
hear from us,

16:17.244 --> 16:18.945
they're gonna send airships
to our last locations.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.714
That's another 30.
We did extractions
like this in Somalia.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.883
We got to make the rescue
as simple as possible.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.218
If we can get above
that tree line,

16:25.285 --> 16:26.653
they'll be able
to spot us faster.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.957
What?
It's just a long way
up that mountain.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.793
And we're outnumbered,
we're out... We're outgunned,
Hawkins knows the terrain.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.762
You're injured.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.730
I say we make cover,

16:37.797 --> 16:40.933
wait for the airship,
use the flare.

16:45.638 --> 16:49.209
No. No, those birds need
a flat place to land.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.744
We got no idea how far we are
from that cabin.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.114
Look, I'm good.
Okay? I can move.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.383
Sorry, Deac,
but I'm making the call.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.917
We're headed up.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.152
You understand?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.487
Roger that.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.224
All right. Now, that plateau
has got to be 40 minutes away.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.392
We're gonna make it in 30.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.693
Let's go.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.436
CHP just spotted
a large group of Jackal bikers
riding into the city.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.071
Did Hondo find anything
from Deacon's contact

17:18.138 --> 17:19.439
about what's causing
all of this?

17:19.506 --> 17:21.274
No, I haven't heard
anything back from them,

17:21.341 --> 17:22.875
but I'll have Dispatch
try them again.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.178
This meth war is about
to become a shooting
gallery in the streets.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.980
What else do we have?
Mumford's team found all
the Mercs from this morning.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.417
They're bringing one
back to HQ
for questioning now.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.152
I did a little digging into
the other Merc shootings.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.122
The first one, last week,
happened at a bar
called The Monkey Man.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.725
There was four Smiling Jackals
killed, two top lieutenants.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.162
Here's the thing, though,
The Monkey Man
isn't a public Jackal front.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.097
Only Jackals and a
few cops knew about it.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
CORTEZ:
But the Mercs knew that.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.967
So they've got
an inside source.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.437
Keep digging,
and let me know if Hondo
or Deacon find anything.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.049
I didn't mean to get you
in the doghouse with Hicks.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.851
I'm really sorry.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.454
Look, I shared Erica's results
with you in confidence.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.055
I know.
And I shouldn't have...

18:09.122 --> 18:11.358
My dad was an evaluator,
and his dad, too.
It's part of my legacy here.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.626
And you wouldn't let
someone who deserved
S.W.A.T. get railroaded.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.529
You would look at her files,
make sure that Hicks
made the right call.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.097
Right?
Of course I would.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.566
I'm just asking
for the real story.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.967
Seriously?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.369
You already burned me
once with Hicks.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.304
I know, and I'm sorry.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.206
It won't happen again.
I promise.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.941
What do you know?

18:33.180 --> 18:36.115
Two years ago,
she failed to properly
restrain a suspect.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.684
That's just
sloppy procedure.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.319
He broke free
and attacked her partner.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.588
The whole reason
why I got Street to help her
through the academy

18:41.654 --> 18:44.357
is that everything that
I heard was that she had
what it took to be S.W.A.T.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.792
You're telling me
I got fooled by her?

18:45.858 --> 18:48.228
Now, hold up.
It never came up before

18:48.295 --> 18:51.431
because her COs never said
anything about it
in our background interviews.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.065
Like they didn't want
to report it.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.635
Sounds like there's
more to the story
than what Hicks knows.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.341
By the way,

19:01.408 --> 19:03.443
don't let Hicks take a shot
at your legacy.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.078
Your dad was on the committee
that picked me.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.480
You're living up
to the Luca name.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.817
We're gonna get to the truth.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.359
Deac, we can't stop
every ten minutes for you
to make sound alarms.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.993
These saplings snap loudly
when they're set off.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.129
That buys us ten seconds
that could save our lives.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.099
You hear that stream?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.701
We got to bear
away from that,

19:28.768 --> 19:30.102
head in that direction.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.872
All right, never travel
by bodies of water.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.841
It's the first place
the enemy looks.
Keep pace,

19:34.907 --> 19:36.476
but stay quiet.
Heel, toe.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.014
You know more than
campfires and marshmallows.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.083
You did a lot more
than go camping
with your daddy, didn't you?

19:44.150 --> 19:47.053
Yeah, basic New England
woods skills.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.389
Deac, you're from L.A.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.259
Yeah, but I spent
a lot of summers camping
with my dad in Vermont.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.995
Oh, come on, come on.

20:00.567 --> 20:04.971
Yeah, the truth is, my, uh,
my folks had kind of
a rocky marriage.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.641
We weren't the type
of family to get a divorce,
so...

20:08.708 --> 20:11.411
His summers camping
with me was kind of a...

20:11.478 --> 20:13.280
Catholic compromise.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.882
I knew why
my dad did it, but...

20:15.948 --> 20:18.451
I didn't let it get
in the way of me

20:18.518 --> 20:20.287
enjoying some time
with my old man.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.694
A lot of great nights.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.095
Lot of marshmallows.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.932
All right,
we should keep moving.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.801
All right, Deac,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.839
Your shiny white boy sweat
makes you look like
a homing beacon.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.341
We should
both mask up.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.209
It's another Marine trick.
Come on.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.347
You read the
incident report?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.181
Then you know it's enough
to keep me off S.W.A.T.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.551
If it really happened.
It's in the report.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.186
Leave it alone.
If it was your first week
on the street, I could,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.623
but you're seven years in
and a training officer.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.759
Just tell me what happened.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.262
It's just us right now.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.102
There is no "us," Chris.
You're already S.W.A.T.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.672
They got no interest in me.
If it wasn't this,

21:12.739 --> 21:14.240
they'd just make up
something else.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.516
DISPATCHER:
20

21:23.583 --> 21:25.117
Dispatch requesting check-in.

21:30.390 --> 21:33.225
This is 30-David. Got a little
static from the mountains.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.829
20-David and I are Code 4.
Sorry for the radio silence.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.298
Couldn't find the target,
still looking for him.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.839
CORTEZ:
Thanks for letting me know.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.075
That was Dispatch.
Hondo and Deacon
just checked in.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.144
They haven't been able
to find Deacon's contact,
so they have nothing.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.514
The Merc shooter's
in Interrogation.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.216
I, uh, looked into
Erica's records.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.487
I asked her about
the infraction,

22:00.553 --> 22:03.022
but she was acting strange,
like she was hiding something.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.957
It doesn't add up.
Hicks is looking into it.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.093
Hicks is gonna take
the first version he hears.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.096
I want the truth, even if
it's not good for Erica.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.400
Can you get me
the contact info
of her old partner?

22:14.401 --> 22:16.436
Please, Captain.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.738
I went about it wrong
this morning.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.172
Let me do it right.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.843
I'll see what I can do.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.654
Mr. Savoy, you've had
a busy morning.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.893
Montrose Mercs for life,
sweet thing.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.462
STREET: I don't know why
you're acting so proud.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.764
Half our squad hadn't
even heard of you clowns
till this morning.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.599
Yeah, well,
you will now, won't you?

22:46.666 --> 22:49.235
What, after you've
taken out the biggest rival
meth gang in the city?

22:49.301 --> 22:50.570
CORTEZ:
We found your list.

22:50.637 --> 22:54.373
Top Jackal members, addresses,
hangouts, even street names.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.008
That's hard information
to come by.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.778
This wasn't just
a "spray and pray"
for a few more corners.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.547
These are targeted
assassinations.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.282
More Jackals are already
on their way
into town to retaliate.

23:03.349 --> 23:06.553
We'll be ready for 'em.
STREET: Well, not you.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.254
We're benching you
for the big game.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.389
The city wants
this handled.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.091
So there's a deal
to be made.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.694
No one in your situation
gets a chance like this.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.095
Take it.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.568
Nah.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.670
Nah, Montrose Mercs for life.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.048
Okay. Right there, Deac.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.585
Right there,
that break
in the trees.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.053
We're gonna have
to climb it.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.955
No, we...
We don't know how sturdy
any of those boulders are.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.192
One loose rock, we'd be
back down here on our ass
in less than five minutes.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.761
Not to mention we'd be
broadcasting exactly where
we are to Hawkins.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.196
Those choppers
are coming.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.165
If we don't get up there soon,
they're gonna pass us by.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.234
We get to that
extraction point
as fast as possible,

23:55.301 --> 23:57.136
that is the
mission objective.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.371
It won't be any faster if we
don't make it all the way up.
This is not your call.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.407
What makes it yours?

24:03.309 --> 24:04.477
Don't make me pull rank here.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.514
Rank? This stopped
being a S.W.A.T. mission

24:07.580 --> 24:09.148
about halfway down that
cliff we jumped off of.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.217
Right now it's just two guys
trying to stay alive.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.553
It is my responsibility
to get us out of here.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.154
Look, I get that you
have Marine training.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.824
This is not Somalia.
This is unique terrain.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.826
I spent a lot of time
in woods like these.

24:19.892 --> 24:20.993
I know what
we need to do,

24:21.060 --> 24:23.329
and I'm not gonna follow
you up into a situation

24:23.395 --> 24:24.631
that's gonna get
us both killed.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.465
I will not do that
to my wife and kids.

24:26.533 --> 24:29.001
Do you really think
I would put us in a dangerous
spot like that?

24:29.068 --> 24:31.804
If you take us
up there? Yes.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.472
Now, you can come
with me or not.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.642
Deacon. Deac.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.190
Look, if you got
some type of problem,
now is not the time for it.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.725
That hill was a bad call.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.960
I'm talking
about this attitude

24:54.026 --> 24:55.394
I've been picking up on
since the cabin.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.063
It's no attitude.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.732
Just wish I had more time
to get some stuff that
we could use,

24:59.799 --> 25:01.901
like a compass
or a map maybe.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.435
That fishing line
came in handy.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.372
We were in a situation
and I had to get us out.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.974
I reacted.
That's how I'm trained.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.275
If you're still
beating yourself up

25:09.341 --> 25:10.543
about not catching
onto Hawkins,

25:10.610 --> 25:12.144
I told you, don't
let it get to you.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.946
Keep your voice down.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.017
I can't get us
out of here

25:18.084 --> 25:20.052
if I have to worry
about whether or not my
partner still has my six.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.521
You don't have to worry
about getting us out of here.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.123
You keep trying to make
calls in a situation

25:24.190 --> 25:25.558
that you don't know
as much about as I do.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.926
It's my job to
make the calls.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.628
I understand that's how
you see the job, Hondo.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.098
Deacon, this
is my team.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.000
How I see it
is how it is.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.134
Don't worry.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.603
There's no question
about whose team it is.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.571
Is this about you
getting passed over?

25:38.638 --> 25:39.939
That was
nine months ago, man.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.974
You're still
thinking about it?

25:42.041 --> 25:44.010
Of course I still
think about it.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.779
I thought we buried this,
and I thought you had my back.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.147
I have always had your back.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.250
And I would never put
the team in danger.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.485
Yeah, every once in a while,
when I'm driving into work,

25:53.552 --> 25:54.954
about to take a left
into the garage,

25:55.021 --> 25:56.255
I think about how
long it's gonna be

25:56.322 --> 25:57.423
before I get
a shot at a team.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.091
If I ever get a shot.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.494
All because of some
mistake Buck made.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.930
You think I didn't
deserve this job?

26:03.996 --> 26:05.464
That's not what
this is about.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.066
Or that you could've done
the job better than me?

26:08.034 --> 26:09.268
We'll never know.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.605
But I do know that
I was supposed to be next.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.141
And I did nothing
to deserve losing that.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.576
Did you ever think
about the position
that I was put in?

26:17.644 --> 26:19.445
What'd you want me to do?
Turn the job down?

26:21.981 --> 26:23.382
It was supposed to be my team.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.087
That's one of the saplings.
50 yards that way.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.128
We can't let him fire
a single shot.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.830
Every Merc in the woods
is gonna know our location.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.580
Just cuff him
and get his gun.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.315
We don't have time to gag 'em.
Wouldn't do
any good anyway.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.384
Rest of the Mercs
are on their way.
Drag him over here.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.459
You're good?
Let's move, move.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.010
Where are the airships?
They should be here by now.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.244
We've been missing
over three hours.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.449
Your car.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.751
Your car at the cabin.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.455
Hawkins could've given
the all clear to HQ.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.325
He'd know the codes.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.993
It could be nightfall before
S.W.A.T. comes looking for us.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.864
We got to figure
another way out of here.
How?

27:44.931 --> 27:47.033
We're hours deeper into
the woods than we were before.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.935
Okay, you know what?
You've said your piece, man.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.036
I don't need to
hear it again.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.470
You wanted me
to be honest.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.174
I don't care that you felt
burned when this went down.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.943
I care that you're
still holding onto it.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.378
After all this team's
been through,
you're still hung up on that.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.848
Hey, I always put
the team first.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.282
I have followed you
without question.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.616
That is what your job is.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.252
And I could do that and still
feel like I deserved better.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.553
Not if you want this job.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.388
The team comes before
everything else, man.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.490
Putting yourself in danger
doesn't make you
a better team leader.

28:11.557 --> 28:12.658
You don't always
have to be the one

28:12.725 --> 28:14.193
climbing on top
of a moving truck

28:14.260 --> 28:16.028
or taking a sniper shot
out of a helicopter.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.396
You tell me that
you're thinking

28:17.463 --> 28:19.031
of the team in those moments.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.233
Is that what you're after?
The glory?

28:21.300 --> 28:23.235
I want you to admit that
you need to be the hero,

28:23.302 --> 28:24.670
carrying all of us
on your back.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.906
I've been holding things up
on my own my entire life.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.607
What, you think
that's a choice?

28:28.674 --> 28:30.142
My daddy
actually left my mama.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.478
Yeah, when I was 14,

28:32.544 --> 28:33.913
and I could've got
caught up in the streets

28:33.980 --> 28:36.215
and paid my mama's bills
with dirty money.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.918
Or I could step up and be
the man and take care of her

28:38.985 --> 28:40.753
the right way, by myself.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.424
I didn't know that
about your father.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.660
You never talk
about your family.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.801
Deac, it wasn't easy
for me coming up
through L.A.P.D. either.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.904
I had to be better than
they thought I was,
just the black dude.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.672
To be as good meant
I was only gonna stay
in the same place.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.951
Hey, Hondo.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.853
You saved all
of our lives
more than once.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.724
Your approach works.
You make S.W.A.T. better.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.393
And I'm proud
to serve with you.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.529
I'm not bitter.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.900
I just...

29:27.967 --> 29:29.568
It kills me that
I feel this way at all.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.072
I don't want to.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.048
HAWKINS:
I found my boys, Deacon.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.649
You must be close.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.785
Why drag this out?

29:53.192 --> 29:54.726
What do we do?
Those rocks.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.528
Three o'clock, now. Move.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.308
LEWIS: Uh, hello?

30:09.375 --> 30:13.079
Are you Officer Alonso?
I was told I could
find you here.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.147
I got a call from
a Captain Cortez

30:15.214 --> 30:18.184
asking me to come in?
I'm Ryan Lewis, 77th division.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.685
Great to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.

30:19.751 --> 30:22.021
Uh, I'm not sure what S.W.A.T.
needs my help with, though.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.256
I want to talk
about Erica Rogers.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.959
Specifically about an incident
that happened two years ago.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.696
Everything's in the report.
Yeah.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.298
I want to know
what's not in the report.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.234
Look, I can't help you.

30:35.301 --> 30:38.971
150. That's how many
try out for S.W.A.T.
every single year.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.706
Half of them don't make
their PFQs,

30:40.772 --> 30:42.574
another 40 wash out in a week,

30:42.641 --> 30:46.178
and then it starts
to gets hard.
And those last 40?

30:46.245 --> 30:48.514
They drop out
on their own.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.950
Erica didn't.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.651
And unless you can tell me
what happened that day,

30:52.718 --> 30:55.221
it'll all be for nothing.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.589
Please don't involve
me in this, all right?

30:57.656 --> 31:00.092
My wife just had a baby.
I'm on detective track.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.593
Have you seen
Erica lately?

31:01.660 --> 31:04.296
She's given
everything for this.
Of course I've seen her.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.732
I still grab chicken wings
with her once a week.

31:06.798 --> 31:09.268
I mean, she's my son's
godmother, okay?

31:09.335 --> 31:12.171
She made me
the man I am today.
I owe my career to her.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.642
It was you.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.911
You didn't restrain
the suspect.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.981
But Erica had to take
the hit for you.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.617
Look, I was still on
my probation period.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.120
All right, it would have
been my third strike.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.756
I didn't ask her to do it.
Okay? She just did it.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.325
And if she hadn't,
I would've washed out.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.594
So, every day since,
I have tried to be

31:35.661 --> 31:38.864
the cop that she put her
career on the line to save.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.399
She needs you now.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.334
They're holding that mark
against her to keep her out
of S.W.A.T.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.003
What? No. She...
She never said that she...

31:44.070 --> 31:45.504
She doesn't want you
to take the hit.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.173
That's why she
deserves the spot.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.910
She needs somebody
watching her back.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.190
He's got the mother
of all deals
on the table.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.525
All he's doing is repeating
how loyal he is.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.327
TAN:
He almost took it before.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.661
What's holding him back?

32:10.862 --> 32:11.897
Stay here.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.099
Follow my lead.

32:19.038 --> 32:22.208
Your crew attacked
The Monkey Man bar
last week.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.376
Not many people know
that's a Jackal hangout.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.215
Who are you looking at,
Mr. Savoy?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.718
Turn off the cameras
and leave us.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.691
I don't know why you think
someone inside the police
is a Montrose Merc,

32:39.758 --> 32:41.027
but this is S.W.A.T.,

32:41.093 --> 32:42.794
and everyone here
works for me.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.530
Nothing you say
is gonna be leaked.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.731
And the deal
I'm offering you

32:45.797 --> 32:47.566
disappears the minute
I walk out that door.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.008
All right.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.943
Okay.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.014
He used to run with us

33:02.081 --> 33:05.284
before a bunch of our
bosses got busted.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.952
He showed up
a couple months later

33:07.019 --> 33:09.388
bragging that
he used to be a cop,

33:09.455 --> 33:11.657
and how easy it was
to take us down.

33:14.660 --> 33:18.064
But then he said he knew a way
for us to get it all back.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.398
An ex-cop.

33:19.465 --> 33:24.270
He had the hookups,
like weapons, intel.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.772
Before we knew it,
he was telling us all
what to do.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.440
I need a name.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.377
Look, you know...
If you want this deal,
I need a name.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.513
Now.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.350
Hawkins.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.524
Dispatch just sent
the recording of the call.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.892
HAWKINS:
This is 30-David.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.327
Got a little static
from the mountains.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.795
20-David and I are Code 4.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.630
That's not Deacon.
Sorry for the radio silence.

33:51.697 --> 33:55.901
Last logged location was,
um, Hawkins' cabin in
Angeles National Forest.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.336
Man, they've been gone,
like, six hours.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.704
Get the airships ready.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.546
There's rock cover
50 yards north of here.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.581
Plenty of trees
along the way.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.650
Alternate.
Don't spare anything.
All right.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.729
DEACON: What happened
to you, Hawkins?

34:23.795 --> 34:24.996
You used to be a good cop.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.665
HAWKINS:
And then I was a retired cop.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.567
What's that?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.569
Just an old man
in the mountains.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.204
I gave my best years
to that badge,

34:32.271 --> 34:34.573
and I got nothing
in return.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.143
I saw an opportunity
for some respect.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.844
Any minute, this sky's gonna
be filled with airships.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.981
Where are they, Hondo?
No one's coming.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.451
You don't want two bodies
on your jacket, Hawkins.

34:45.517 --> 34:46.552
Deacon, move!

34:54.760 --> 34:57.263
Deacon, I'm out.
Hondo, move!

35:03.202 --> 35:05.304
HONDO: Deacon, left side!

35:05.371 --> 35:06.605
Deacon, go!

35:14.480 --> 35:16.715
I got one of 'em, Deac.
Me, too.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.650
So that leaves eight.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.486
I got, uh, four rounds.
I got three.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.322
All right, that means
one of is gonna have
to take out two with one.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.591
Now's a good time
to be a hero.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.193
Don't look at me
to do it.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.565
If not now, when?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.874
You're passing over
the cabin now.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.411
I've got these heat signatures
all over the woods.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.078
I'm counting 12 people.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.080
Some of them aren't moving.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.949
Can't tell which ones
are Hondo and Deacon.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.152
Guys, look. Two o'clock!

35:54.220 --> 35:55.321
Two o'clock!

36:00.626 --> 36:02.060
You ready?

36:02.928 --> 36:03.929
Go.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.473
Deac, there's the team.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.630
Everybody out of here.

36:40.999 --> 36:44.202
Hey! Hey, here!
You guys okay?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.637
Hondo's hurt.
His right side.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.872
Luca, get this
jacket off of me.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.240
We came as soon as
we learned about Hawkins.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.509
I hope you brought us
some gear.
You know we did.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.211
Chris, give me your radio.
Okay...

36:53.279 --> 36:54.680
Captain...

36:54.746 --> 36:55.914
Captain, how we looking?

36:55.981 --> 36:58.049
It's good to hear
your voice, Hondo.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.685
We're not out
of the woods yet, literally.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.888
And we're not gonna be until
we get every last Merc,
especially Hawkins.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.189
The rest of the cavalry's
on their way.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.325
Mumford's team will sweep
from the cabin north,

37:06.392 --> 37:08.960
but we can follow the trails
picked up from
the heat signatures.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.829
All right.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.698
They're gonna be scattering
in all different directions.
Let's go get 'em.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.233
You up for this, boss?

37:18.904 --> 37:19.971
Hell yeah.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.409
Let's move.
Let's go!

37:29.448 --> 37:30.616
CORTEZ: Two shooters
heading south.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.784
Another couple running east
and moving fast.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.653
And a pair heading northwest,
back up the mountain.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.356
All right, Street and Tan,
take the crew to
the south... Go, go.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.790
Chris and Luca,
go east. Move.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.428
That leaves a pair
for you and me, Deac.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.495
Back to the high ground.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.868
Give me your hands.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.304
Hands! Hands!

37:52.371 --> 37:53.839
Behind your back!

37:53.905 --> 37:55.374
CHRIS:
We got one and two.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.913
They should be
right here.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.281
We're practically
standing on top of 'em.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.819
TAN:
Let me see your hands!

38:10.756 --> 38:11.890
Got three and four.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.359
Just two left, Hondo.

38:18.930 --> 38:19.931
Hawkins!

38:27.205 --> 38:28.840
I guess this is where
it ends, huh, Deacon?

38:29.775 --> 38:30.876
Come on, man.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.512
I never come up this far.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.580
I never knew
this was here.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.681
Come on, Sam,
get out of there.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.248
What are you doing, man?
Get on the ground.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.551
Hondo, high right!

39:13.819 --> 39:15.954
Is he going to be okay?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.790
He just needs some
time alone to process.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.325
He'll be all right.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.298
I guess covering
for your partner

39:27.365 --> 39:28.934
isn't as bad as
letting a perp go.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.670
You didn't just cover.
You taught him
how to be better.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.005
And you took a personal hit
for somebody who needed it.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.909
Lewis told me
what you did.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.778
Sorry I lashed out.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.813
That's okay.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.682
Fancy my surprise
when I called

39:43.749 --> 39:45.584
Officer Lewis
to S.W.A.T. headquarters,

39:45.651 --> 39:47.653
and he's already in
the building asking for me.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.623
I wasn't gonna let
a star recruit like Rogers

39:51.690 --> 39:53.992
wash out without doing
the legwork myself.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.827
Yes, sir.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.630
She's gonna make
a great officer.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.998
Yeah.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.033
I understand you trust
your teammates.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.803
But don't forget,
I'm your teammate, too.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.004
All right?

40:09.374 --> 40:10.642
Let's go, you guys.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.511
Ah, well-deserved, Erica.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.012
Welcome to S.W.A.T.
Yeah.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.781
Congrats.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.048
Congratulations.
Thank you, thank you.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.650
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.486
Hey, the other recruits
waited to celebrate,
so I'm gonna go join them.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.287
Have a feeling
you're gonna drink them
under the table.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.022
Yeah. Taught her how
to do that, too.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.625
See you around.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.827
See you.
Bye.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.862
ERICA:  Hey...

40:42.741 --> 40:45.176
You didn't wash off, huh?

40:45.243 --> 40:46.512
I've never wanted
a hot shower

40:46.578 --> 40:48.313
in my own home
more in my life.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.281
Hmm. Yeah.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.593
Hey, Deac, uh...

41:03.428 --> 41:06.798
Listen, uh, when I
took team leader,

41:06.865 --> 41:09.735
I tried to treat everybody
the same as before.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.937
Just do the job,
like a normal promotion.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.006
Those first few weeks,
I was just playing a role.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.809
I think we both were.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.883
Deac, I'll never regret
taking this job.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.653
There's been a lot of changes
I've been trying to make
ever since I got here.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.490
But I could've
handled it better.

41:32.558 --> 41:35.661
I could've been more
direct with you about
how you were feeling

41:35.727 --> 41:37.395
and more honest
about how I was.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.097
How I am, Deac.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.334
But I know you would
have been great.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.672
I really do hope
you get your chance.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.912
Well, get home,
get rinsed off,

41:53.979 --> 41:55.413
especially before you
start hugging on Annie.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.982
Otherwise you're gonna be
sleeping on my couch.

41:58.784 --> 42:00.051
Later.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.121
You got plans tonight?

42:04.389 --> 42:05.456
Hell no.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.758
* Living too fast

42:07.458 --> 42:09.260
You do now.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.763
* What are we doing here?

42:11.830 --> 42:12.964
* Too distracted to react

42:14.199 --> 42:18.269
* Busy lives guided by fear

42:18.336 --> 42:24.976
* I think it's time
that we all slow down

42:25.043 --> 42:26.878
* And take
a long look around *
