it's not really a prank

just not the part where someone
is confused or uncomfortable.

-Yup.

-I had you. (laughs)
-Yup, you did.

03:08.004 --> 03:09.579
April stool, I love it.

You seem tense, Bob.

03:22.761 --> 03:23.869
Do you have an impacted colon?

03:24.096 --> 03:26.279
No, just waiting
for the prank.

03:26.432 --> 03:27.614
There could be
some colon stuff, too.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.374
I could just be here
for the rent, you know?

03:29.526 --> 03:30.709
It is the first of the month.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.026
Oh, that would be great.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.045
-Do you have it?
-LINDA and BOB: No.

03:33.272 --> 03:34.287
But we'll get it. Probably.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.106
Bob, there's a bear
in your kitchen.

03:36.124 --> 03:37.532
You put a bear in my kitchen?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.717
Ow. What the...

03:38.944 --> 03:40.535
April Fool's.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.778
Standing "O."

03:41.871 --> 03:43.447
For the record, I also
would have taken a bear.

03:43.465 --> 03:46.132
Wow. Bob, you see
how realistic it looks?

03:46.285 --> 03:47.801
Yeah, I-I saw it, Lin.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.061
It's trompe l'oeil.

03:49.212 --> 03:50.787
That's French for
"Hee-hee-hee, gotcha Bob."

03:50.806 --> 03:53.047
I commissioned it from
a starving boardwalk artist

03:53.067 --> 03:54.624
and, uh, Freddy, here, used

03:54.643 --> 03:56.884
my landlord key
to install it before dawn.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.295
I'm so sorry, Bob.

03:58.388 --> 04:00.130
He made me do it.
By paying me money.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.390
Forgive me.
Why aren't you forgiving me?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.967
-Teddy, uh, it's fine.
-Oh, good.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.244
Mr. Fischoeder, I'll be over

04:05.395 --> 04:06.894
soon to finish
painting your mansion.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.229
Yes, Freddy, about that,

04:08.323 --> 04:10.898
is all the unsightly
scaffolding necessary?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.234
Uh, well, it's kind of how
I reach the higher floors.

04:13.328 --> 04:15.236
Couldn't you just sort
of catapult yourself up

04:15.330 --> 04:16.922
and paint, paint, paint
before you crash to the ground?

04:17.149 --> 04:18.906
-Uh, I could try.
-Good man.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.667
Well, uh, I guess that's it,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.210
so... see you next year?

04:22.321 --> 04:23.653
Bob, we need to talk.

04:23.672 --> 04:24.930
In our pranking relationship,

04:25.157 --> 04:26.840
I feel that I do all the work.

04:26.992 --> 04:28.174
You've never
pranked me back once.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.601
Except for
the bounced rent checks.

04:29.828 --> 04:32.345
-Heh, heh. You don't like those?
-They're okay, not great.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.180
Bob, I feel a little
taken for granted.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.308
-It's not working. Us.
-Us?

04:36.460 --> 04:38.835
I wish I didn't even have
to say this, but here goes.

04:38.854 --> 04:40.928
Bob, this year,
will you prank me?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.672
-TINA: Aw.
-I-I'm sorry?

04:42.691 --> 04:44.341
Prank me. Amuse and enchant me,

04:44.359 --> 04:45.617
as I do for you every year.

04:45.844 --> 04:48.194
Mr. Fischoeder,
I-I'm flattered,

04:48.289 --> 04:50.104
but you're a millionaire

04:50.124 --> 04:51.515
with a lot of time
on your hands.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.682
Possibly too much.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.534
And I'm not.
I have a restaurant to run.

04:54.686 --> 04:57.203
-You do? That's exciting.
-Yay, Dad.

04:57.356 --> 04:58.355
Where? Oh, this place.

04:58.373 --> 05:00.524
Anyway, uh, no, thank you?

05:00.692 --> 05:02.450
Well, I guess you can't
force these things, right?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.861
But it's still early.
Maybe you'll change your mind.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.097
(laughing wildly)

05:11.478 --> 05:15.296
Oh, what a merry...
scary laugh.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.707
Aren't you being a little bit
of a pranky pooper, Bob?

05:17.726 --> 05:20.635
No, pranking our landlord
is a terrible idea.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.213
I'm not gonna do it,
and no one can make me.

05:23.231 --> 05:24.639
That's how I handle
my math homework.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.158
And it works. Mostly.
We'll talk later.

05:26.385 --> 05:27.567
Oh, my God, he's back.

05:27.719 --> 05:30.220
Right now it's sort of
a quasi-hamburger stand,

05:30.238 --> 05:32.222
but picture it
without the greasy, uh...

05:32.315 --> 05:32.980
people.

05:33.075 --> 05:34.074
What-What's going on?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.225
I'm getting out there, Bob.

05:35.243 --> 05:36.910
Meeting prospective new tenants.

05:37.062 --> 05:38.170
-For here?
-Mm-hmm.

05:38.397 --> 05:40.246
And you met him in
the last 15 minutes?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.065
It all happens online
these days.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.176
I like this one.
Younger, lots of energy.

05:44.327 --> 05:45.827
-Super pranky.
-Oh, my God.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.737
So what kind
of store you opening?

05:47.831 --> 05:49.255
Uh, a chain store?

05:49.408 --> 05:51.925
Every kind of... chain.
Key, bicycle, neck.

05:52.001 --> 05:53.259
You just saved me two stops.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.520
Actually, the store
next door is vacant.

05:55.672 --> 05:58.005
Oh, that space is
nothing compared to this.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.340
Oh, yeah,
much better light here.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.008
And just a better
flow in general.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.009
Thanks, guys.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.344
I am definitely interested.

06:03.438 --> 06:05.922
Good, I should know
by the end of the day

06:05.941 --> 06:07.757
if the space is available.

06:07.776 --> 06:09.259
End of the day.

06:09.352 --> 06:10.869
Is Mr. Fischoeder really
gonna kick us out

06:11.096 --> 06:12.746
for another tenant
if we don't prank him?

06:12.931 --> 06:13.947
He'd be crazy not to.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.281
All those amazing chains.

06:15.434 --> 06:17.876
I honestly am not sure
how serious he is,

06:18.027 --> 06:21.195
so I guess
we're pranking our landlord.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.340
-(cheering)
-I pity the April fool.

06:27.629 --> 06:28.795
How about this for a prank?

06:28.947 --> 06:29.888
Creep up behind him
and slowly move

06:29.965 --> 06:31.205
Mr. Fischoeder's eyepatch

06:31.299 --> 06:33.207
-until it covers his good eye.
-Uh...

06:33.410 --> 06:35.301
Ooh, give him a fake scar
while he's sleeping

06:35.454 --> 06:37.137
and tell him
you stole his pancreas.

06:37.289 --> 06:38.379
He's probably got a great

06:38.399 --> 06:40.381
-rich guy pancreas, I bet.
-No.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.958
Ask Jimmy Jr.
how he's gonna prank Tina

06:42.051 --> 06:42.901
on their frozen yogurt date

06:43.052 --> 06:43.960
-and just do that?
-Wait, what?

06:44.053 --> 06:45.629
Move all the clocks
in his house

06:45.647 --> 06:49.466
ahead by one minute so he'll be
one minute early for everything.

06:49.468 --> 06:51.635
Aw, Gene, sweetie,
that's still not quite a prank.

06:51.653 --> 06:53.987
-It's really helpful, actually.
-Darn it.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.396
I just want something simple.

06:55.490 --> 06:59.159
Like, what if I send him
a pizza with weird toppings?

06:59.235 --> 07:01.144
Weird toppings?
That's your prank?

07:01.163 --> 07:02.904
Yeah, things
that don't go together.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.481
Like shrimp with hot dogs?

07:04.499 --> 07:06.591
-Go on.
-Yeah, that's making me hungry.

07:06.818 --> 07:08.168
Should we eat one
first and decide?

07:08.320 --> 07:09.486
Can we throw
some pineapple on there?

07:09.504 --> 07:11.245
Stop wanting
to eat the prank pizza.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.006
-(telephone rings)
-Everybody's overthinking it.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.007
Bob's Burgers.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.175
Bob, about the prank.

07:15.327 --> 07:17.010
I hope you aren't
underthinking it

07:17.104 --> 07:19.137
and planning
something super wimpy.

07:19.289 --> 07:21.164
Go big.
I want to feel something.

07:21.257 --> 07:23.183
Otherwise, it doesn't count.
Bye.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.517
You, down there,
catch this knife.

07:24.670 --> 07:26.594
-(child screaming)
-Kidding. Kidding, kidding.

07:26.688 --> 07:28.280
It's April Fool's. Sheesh.

07:28.431 --> 07:30.356
(groans) He wants
to feel something.

07:30.509 --> 07:33.193
Okay, Dad, to do this right,
you got to go deep.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.953
Talk to people,
dig through some garbage,

07:35.104 --> 07:37.122
find out what makes
Mr. Fischoeder tick.

07:37.273 --> 07:38.623
What does he care about most?

07:38.775 --> 07:40.517
Find that and you'll know
how to prank him.

07:40.686 --> 07:43.369
(sighs) Fine, but I am not
looking through garbage.

07:43.522 --> 07:45.855
And I'm looking through garbage.

07:45.949 --> 07:47.132
I'm sorry, but how else
are we gonna find

07:47.283 --> 07:48.616
Mr. Fischoeder's
dark, dirty secrets

07:48.635 --> 07:50.527
without going through
his dark, dirty trash?

07:50.696 --> 07:52.137
I just want this to be over.

07:52.364 --> 07:54.514
What are you
so excited to get back to?

07:55.717 --> 07:57.701
Ooh, Felix. Let's talk to Felix.

07:57.719 --> 07:59.144
-Oh, uh, no?
-Yes.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.553
He knows things
about his brother,

08:00.647 --> 08:02.814
and I'm sure he'll be happy
to help us.

08:02.966 --> 08:04.374
I'm not helping you.

08:04.392 --> 08:05.875
Especially with
prank stuff. Go away.

08:05.969 --> 08:07.652
-BOB: But...
-I'm going upstairs now
and you can't follow

08:07.804 --> 08:10.213
'cause you're too uncoordinated
to go up a spiral staircase.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.716
What? No, I can. I think.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.141
Don't you just keep turning?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.161
-Come on, we need the info.
-Okay, fine.

08:16.312 --> 08:17.496
Ugh, you followed me?

08:17.647 --> 08:19.906
Well, do not criticize
my form. (moaning)

08:20.000 --> 08:23.560
Felix, please just tell us what
Mr. Fischoeder cares about,

08:23.578 --> 08:24.911
so we can prank him.

08:25.063 --> 08:26.004
All we're asking is for you

08:26.081 --> 08:27.339
to violate your brother's trust

08:27.566 --> 08:29.156
and tell us his deepest
most intimate secrets.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.992
(moans) What about me?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.043
Maybe I'd like to be pranked

08:32.270 --> 08:33.737
by my brother sometime. (moans)

08:33.739 --> 08:36.664
But he only has time
for Bob, Bob, Bob. (moans)

08:36.683 --> 08:37.832
Wait, what's that photo?

08:37.909 --> 08:39.259
Oh, that's just
Calvin and my father

08:39.411 --> 08:41.578
on Dad's precious golf cart.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.413
They would patrol
Wonder Wharf in it,

08:43.506 --> 08:46.007
throwing firecrackers
at carnies who were slacking.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.341
-You know, father-son stuff.
-Mm.

08:47.435 --> 08:49.102
I wasn't allowed to ride in it

08:49.196 --> 08:50.603
because I had what at the time

08:50.756 --> 08:52.088
was called sneaky bladder.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.681
Why do you have this photo?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.534
No reason. I don't pee on it
for revenge sometimes.

08:55.685 --> 08:59.279
Okay. Is this the golf cart
Mr. Fischoeder still uses?

08:59.431 --> 09:01.781
My father passed it on to him.
Along with a lot of money.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.042
And property.
And everything. It's fine.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.935
That's it,
we prank his golf cart.

09:05.954 --> 09:07.103
That's what he cares about.

09:07.196 --> 09:08.605
I told you I'm not
helping you prank.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.966
Now, excuse me, I have to pee.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.760
(slow squeaking)

09:17.299 --> 09:18.631
BOB:
Yes, there he is.

09:18.784 --> 09:19.874
Mr. Fischoeder gets his hair cut

09:19.893 --> 09:21.059
while he's on his
rent-collecting route,

09:21.286 --> 09:22.376
so we got an hour for the prank.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.711
I still don't understand why

09:23.730 --> 09:25.212
it takes that long
for a haircut.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.381
He has it cut
one hair at a time.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.125
I guess he thinks
that makes it fancier.

09:29.218 --> 09:30.235
How do you know this?

09:30.386 --> 09:31.719
Mr. Fischoeder talks
about it. A lot.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.888
Hey, you should get
your one hair cut that way.

09:34.057 --> 09:36.324
I'm calling Teddy
to tell him we're a go.

09:37.819 --> 09:38.635
How much longer?

09:38.653 --> 09:40.061
Rewiring an old golf cart horn

09:40.080 --> 09:42.655
to play a fart sound is not
a job you can rush, Bob.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.642
We got different voltages,
a lot of weird-colored wires.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.252
I don't want to get
philosophical on you,

09:47.403 --> 09:49.254
but it's like a beautiful chaos
under here.

09:49.405 --> 09:52.257
-As fast as you can.
-I love novelty horns.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.259
My truck horn used to play
the song<i> Tequila.</i>

09:54.486 --> 09:56.152
Great tune.
Got pulled over for a lot

09:56.171 --> 09:57.596
of sobriety checks,
but it was worth it.

09:57.747 --> 09:59.764
Okay, we're ready
to connect the horn button

09:59.991 --> 10:01.082
to our fart device.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.416
-Gene?
-So, what're we in the mood for?

10:02.436 --> 10:03.676
-There's flirty.
-(light fart noise)

10:03.829 --> 10:04.919
-Shy.
-(high-pitched fart noise)

10:05.013 --> 10:06.162
-Brooding.
-(low fart noise)

10:06.181 --> 10:06.938
-Whimsical.
-(sputtering fart noise)

10:07.165 --> 10:08.089
Doesn't matter.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.423
Just give it to Teddy, please.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.184
I guess someone doesn't
care about artistry.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.502
Okay, so I left a message

10:12.595 --> 10:14.337
for Mr. Fischoeder
to come by for the rent.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.263
-We have the rent?
-No, of course not.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.507
But he'll come from that way

10:17.525 --> 10:18.283
where the barbershop is,

10:18.434 --> 10:20.118
and he'll honk his annoying horn

10:20.195 --> 10:21.361
like he always does,

10:21.513 --> 10:23.529
and a big fart
will come out instead.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.032
Farty gave a party
and Mr. Fischoeder came.

10:26.109 --> 10:27.775
I'm starting to get
April Fool's Day.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.776
This is kind of fun.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.686
Look at you,

10:29.704 --> 10:30.979
"Prankie Goes to Hollywood."

10:30.981 --> 10:32.279
Maybe I'll do
more pranks after this.

10:32.374 --> 10:34.040
Everything could be a prank.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.692
Not everything.

10:35.785 --> 10:37.877
Sometimes it's just
a romantic and economical trip

10:38.029 --> 10:39.012
to a frozen yogurt place, right?

10:39.122 --> 10:40.530
Yeah. I mean, no way

10:40.548 --> 10:42.123
is Jimmy Jr. trying
to get you there

10:42.217 --> 10:44.458
so he can sneak
back and rob your room.

10:44.552 --> 10:45.977
Right, I agree.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.479
Or get you to eat so fast

10:47.706 --> 10:49.481
that you get brain freeze
and make that weird sound.

10:49.632 --> 10:52.558
-No!
-No, it's more of a... (groans)

10:52.635 --> 10:54.560
-What the hell, Louise?
-Yeah, knock it off, honey.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.713
These are the things
I hope don't happen.

10:56.731 --> 10:58.156
Like, instead of Jimmy Jr.,

10:58.233 --> 10:59.674
it's Andy on Ollie's shoulders
in a trench coat.

10:59.676 --> 11:01.326
-Ah!
-Oh, he's coming.

11:01.477 --> 11:02.977
-(fart device sounding)
-What in the...

11:02.996 --> 11:05.889
-Ha! April Fool...
-No brakes! No brakes!

11:05.982 --> 11:07.832
Whoa, what-what's happening?

11:08.059 --> 11:09.726
I think he said
"no brakes, no brakes." Oh.

11:09.819 --> 11:10.910
-(Fischoeder grunts)
-Oh, my God.

11:11.062 --> 11:12.319
Is my megaphone okay?

11:12.414 --> 11:14.005
Is what Tina was wondering.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.674
Tina, now's not the time.

11:20.088 --> 11:21.404
LINDA:
So, not a great prank, Bob.

11:21.423 --> 11:22.663
I don't know what happened.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.407
This is why I didn't want
to prank our landlord.

11:24.426 --> 11:25.909
Do you think
Mr. Fischoeder is all right?

11:25.927 --> 11:27.243
-Bob tried to kill me.
-What?

11:27.336 --> 11:29.170
You all saw it.
Bob cut my brake line.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.413
No. It was an accident.

11:30.432 --> 11:32.023
He-He wanted me to prank him.

11:32.250 --> 11:35.268
W-We didn't cut his brake line,
it was a fart horn thing.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.530
I think Bob used April Fool's
as a cover for murder.

11:38.681 --> 11:40.273
Maybe because
he's resentful of being

11:40.425 --> 11:42.608
the ridiculous butt
of my genius pranks.

11:42.777 --> 11:44.277
He does have a ridiculous butt.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.187
You know, I-I think you went
a little too far here, Bob.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.098
Me?
Y-You disconnected something.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.616
He did it.
This guy did it.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.877
Novelty horn wiring
isn't an exact science.

11:53.029 --> 11:55.696
And you kept distracting me when
I was trying to work, as you do.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.717
Murderer. You're blackballed
at Reflections.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.945
Your glitter account
is closed, Tyra Pranks.

12:01.963 --> 12:03.704
We have a glitter account?

12:03.724 --> 12:04.614
Uh, yeah.

12:04.707 --> 12:05.724
We use a lot of glitter, Bob.

12:05.951 --> 12:08.134
-I don't know what to tell you.
-Oh, my.

12:08.286 --> 12:09.561
Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Dowling.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.120
This isn't what it looks like.

12:11.214 --> 12:12.379
It is what it looks like.

12:12.457 --> 12:14.457
Bob tried to murder
Mr. Fischoeder.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.550
I wouldn't bank with Bob
if I were you.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.886
And I sure as heck wouldn't
let him work on your car.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.740
We already have so many
reasons not to bank with Bob.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.391
-I'll throw it on the list.
-I don't like that list.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.152
Bob, I'm gonna
take the kids inside.

12:26.304 --> 12:27.728
I'm not saying
this is an angry mob

12:27.822 --> 12:29.063
that might attack you,
but if it is,

12:29.157 --> 12:30.323
I don't want the kids to see it.

12:30.492 --> 12:32.066
Mom'll come back out
with a broken bottle

12:32.160 --> 12:33.493
-if you need her, though.
-(Bob sighs)

12:33.587 --> 12:36.588
-I'm so sorry, Mr. Fischoeder.
-Shh.

12:36.664 --> 12:38.998
I'm listening to his heart
with this thing.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.167
-Your stethoscope?
-Are you a doctor?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.576
Yep. His heart sounds weird.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.912
All right,
let's put him in the cargo area.

12:45.006 --> 12:46.931
Cargo area?
Wait, I know you.

12:47.158 --> 12:48.266
Aren't you the tenant

12:48.417 --> 12:49.675
Mr. Fischoeder
brought over this morning?

12:49.828 --> 12:50.918
No. 'Cause I'm this.

12:51.087 --> 12:52.845
You had that dumb
chain store idea.

12:52.998 --> 12:54.180
-You're dumb.
-Wait--

12:54.274 --> 12:56.423
We're driving off fast now.
Bye.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.184
What's going on?

12:58.261 --> 13:00.278
I swear, it was the same guy.

13:00.505 --> 13:02.113
And definitely not
a great paramedic.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.449
Bob, a lot of people
look like other people.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.175
Like Jessie Eisenberg
and that other guy.

13:06.194 --> 13:07.360
Wait. They're different people?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.788
And you do call me Gene
sometimes. A lot.

13:10.015 --> 13:11.122
Parents do that, Tina.

13:11.349 --> 13:13.516
And you pretty much always
pick up the wrong remote

13:13.535 --> 13:15.985
and keep jabbing it at the TV
when it doesn't work.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.295
It's rough to watch.

13:17.446 --> 13:18.855
It's why I almost stopped coming
to movie night.

13:18.873 --> 13:20.039
They look a lot alike.

13:20.191 --> 13:21.448
Dad, maybe you're
a little out of sorts

13:21.468 --> 13:23.192
because you almost on purpose
killed someone.

13:23.211 --> 13:25.637
Kids, Mr. Fischoeder's
gonna be fine. Probably.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.972
Oh, by the way, Bob,
Joel called.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.641
He can't deliver our buns today.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.051
-Um, that's kind of a problem.
-And then our meat guy called,

13:32.203 --> 13:32.977
and he can't deliver, either.

13:33.129 --> 13:34.461
So problem solved.

13:34.556 --> 13:36.706
They probably both got sick
or kidnapped or something

13:36.724 --> 13:38.149
on the same day; it happens.

13:38.301 --> 13:40.043
But what if word has gotten out,

13:40.061 --> 13:41.894
-and we're blackballed?
-No.

13:42.047 --> 13:44.397
Bob, you're upset.
It's been a crazy day.

13:44.549 --> 13:46.732
Why don't you take the garbage
out and get some air?

13:46.885 --> 13:48.568
-Some back-alley air.
-Fine.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.477
Hey, maybe the police will
look through our trash later,

13:50.572 --> 13:53.331
-like we looked through
Mr. Fischoeder's.
-Mm.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.001
What the hell?

14:02.067 --> 14:03.591
(panting)

14:05.345 --> 14:08.638
Oh-- Oh, God.
Oh, my God...

14:11.167 --> 14:12.241
-Aah!
-Aha.

14:12.335 --> 14:14.760
This is Mr. Fischoeder's
golf cart.

14:14.929 --> 14:18.356
-But I saw it get wrecked.
-Um...

14:18.583 --> 14:20.099
No, I didn't.

14:20.251 --> 14:23.027
That was a decoy golf cart,
wasn't it?

14:23.104 --> 14:24.587
Uh, I go now, bye.
Kisses.

14:24.606 --> 14:26.865
Bup-bup-bup-bup.
After we left the treehouse,

14:27.092 --> 14:30.017
you told Calvin I was going
to prank him with the cart.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.202
So he was one step ahead of me.

14:31.429 --> 14:33.187
-No, dum-dum. He told me.
-What?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.114
I said,
"Do you like the Bee Gees?"

14:35.266 --> 14:37.266
Wait. When I saw the photo,

14:37.435 --> 14:40.044
all your weird lunges were
pointing right at it.

14:40.271 --> 14:42.380
-Not weird, athletic.
-You wanted me to notice

14:42.607 --> 14:44.290
-the golf cart picture.
-Ugh.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.609
Yes, Bob. And it took
so many lunges.

14:46.611 --> 14:49.112
Calvin planned everything.
He even wore a padded suit

14:49.130 --> 14:50.388
for the "accident."

14:50.539 --> 14:53.040
The brakes were fine.
He faked the whole thing.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.451
None of it was real.
The paramedic-tenant guy...

14:55.470 --> 14:58.062
-A carny in a costume.
-Oh, my God.

14:58.289 --> 14:59.546
Am I still being pranked?

14:59.641 --> 15:01.958
All I know is Calvin
is gonna come by tonight

15:01.976 --> 15:03.384
in a full body cast

15:03.478 --> 15:05.478
and burst out of it
and say April Fool's.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.630
Act surprised.
He's also rented 50 doves

15:07.723 --> 15:09.574
to fly out of the cast
when it breaks open.

15:09.725 --> 15:13.060
Wait. Is you telling me this
also part of the prank?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.303
Probably. Let's say yes.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.414
Oh, I hate April Fool's Day.

15:16.641 --> 15:19.142
Now, excuse me,
I'm off to buy dove food.

15:19.235 --> 15:22.478
I'm guessing tacos?
Or Dove Bars?

15:22.497 --> 15:23.588
(Tina sighs)

15:23.739 --> 15:25.572
I just wanted
a simple frozen yogurt date.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.574
With some light handholding,
or heavy,

15:27.652 --> 15:29.152
depending on
how sticky our hands were.

15:29.245 --> 15:32.263
I know, but the safest move now
is simply not to show up.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.265
-You're saying...
-Fro-yo no-show.

15:34.342 --> 15:35.934
-But am I being paranoid?
-(entry bells jingle)

15:36.161 --> 15:39.378
-He's after me.
-You mean like hmm-hmm?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.682
You okay, Bob? You seem great,
just checking.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.518
I found out that Mr. Fischoeder
is still messing with me.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.336
The prank I thought
I was pranking him with

15:47.355 --> 15:49.948
was really him pranking me
with my own prank.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.950
The whole time. You see?

15:52.026 --> 15:54.026
I see that you see something.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.528
We all love you, Bob.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.513
I don't even know how
many people are in on it.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.849
The paramedic?
Edith? Mr. Dowling?

15:59.942 --> 16:00.866
Our meat and bun people?

16:01.019 --> 16:02.609
Okay, still not really sure

16:02.704 --> 16:05.296
what you're talking about, but
probably not that many people

16:05.448 --> 16:07.190
-are in on it, right?
-(phone rings)

16:07.208 --> 16:09.692
Bob's Burgers.
I can't talk now. Bye.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.862
That was Fischoeder, wasn't it?
You can't talk because I'm here.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.473
-You're in on it, Lin.
-It was a telemarketer.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.049
You're a liar-marketer.

16:17.202 --> 16:19.293
-Bobby, no.
-Or what about Teddy?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.887
Ready to pitch in
'cause you happened to have

16:22.040 --> 16:23.464
a novelty car horn in the '90s?

16:23.632 --> 16:26.633
Most people did back then, Bob.
Rush hour was a lot of fun.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.654
Or maybe Louise, who led me
straight to Felix.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.473
Wait, am I in on it?
I kind of want to be in on it.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.218
Or Tina,
with your water spraying.

16:35.236 --> 16:37.737
-You look nice, but you're not.
-Damn.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.664
Gene.
Dear, sweet, innocent Gene.

16:39.891 --> 16:43.001
So pure, so simple.
I know you're not in on it.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.485
-You couldn't be.
-Simple?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.487
You know what?
I'm gonna go see Mr. Fischoeder

16:46.506 --> 16:47.747
and demand my life back.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.915
Why not ask for
a better one instead?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.326
And I'm taking Gene.
He's the only one I can trust.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.237
-I'm flattered and terrified.
-TINA: Flatterfied?

16:54.330 --> 16:56.180
Can I go to the bathroom
before we leave?

16:56.332 --> 16:58.182
No. Maybe.
What kind?

16:58.334 --> 17:00.076
Ah, I don't want to
put a label on it.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.835
I have to go, too.
Can I go first?

17:01.929 --> 17:03.104
You definitely should.

17:07.343 --> 17:08.768
I hear them. They're up there.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.935
You ready to do this?

17:10.088 --> 17:11.254
No. Are you?

17:11.347 --> 17:13.089
I think so.
I mean, we've come this far.

17:13.107 --> 17:14.515
We haven't gone up
the ladder yet.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.682
I did it earlier.

17:15.777 --> 17:18.036
-It's... really hard.
-Should we give up?

17:18.263 --> 17:19.445
No. Let's start climbing,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.356
-but we'll-we'll take breaks.
-I love breaks.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.375
Bit more cocoa
in your rum, Calvin?

17:24.527 --> 17:27.286
Oh, I shouldn't. I still have
to fit inside my body cast.

17:27.438 --> 17:30.940
-And leave room for 50 doves.
-Well, well,

17:31.033 --> 17:31.957
isn't this cozy?

17:32.052 --> 17:34.385
-And cocoa-y.
-Bob.

17:34.462 --> 17:35.702
Uh, close your eyes
and imagine I'm in a cast.

17:35.797 --> 17:37.947
No, no, no.
The jig is up.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.223
I want the pranking to stop.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.225
And I'm not leaving
until you promise me we're done.

17:41.377 --> 17:43.377
Or until we get some cocoa,
at the very least.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.805
Bob, calm down.
The pranking is done now.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.139
You've ruined the last bit.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.232
Also, I don't know why
you're mad. I'm the one

17:48.401 --> 17:49.809
who's out all the dove money.

17:49.961 --> 17:51.051
Why, Mr. Fischoeder?

17:51.145 --> 17:52.295
Why did you put me
through this?

17:52.313 --> 17:54.054
I-I did what you wanted.

17:54.148 --> 17:55.981
I pranked you.
I mean, I tried.

17:56.134 --> 17:57.057
Yes, but did you, Bob?

17:57.151 --> 17:58.076
Did you really try?

17:58.303 --> 17:59.393
First I had to beg you.

17:59.487 --> 18:00.653
Then I had to threaten you.

18:00.805 --> 18:02.471
I manipulated you,
and all I was going to get

18:02.490 --> 18:04.231
for my trouble
was a fart horn.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.267
-Hey.
-LINDA: Bob, you up here?

18:06.327 --> 18:07.310
-Linda?
-We were worried,

18:07.328 --> 18:09.328
so we decided to follow you.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.572
We saw you and Gene
climbing up here.

18:11.649 --> 18:13.165
-Not at all awkwardly.
-Lot of breaks.

18:13.318 --> 18:14.817
Come on, let's go home

18:14.836 --> 18:17.578
before you do or say anything
to our very nice-ish landlord

18:17.746 --> 18:19.931
-that you'll regret.
-Yes, Bob, go home and rest up

18:20.158 --> 18:21.933
-for next April Fool's.
-It's never going to stop,
is it?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.584
I don't see why it would.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.085
The question you should
be asking is how will

18:25.105 --> 18:26.270
I keep topping myself?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.088
Unrelated:
how many cubic feet of Jell-O

18:28.166 --> 18:30.333
would 10,000 boxes make?

18:30.351 --> 18:32.001
We owe it to ourselves
to find out.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.111
No. No...

18:33.262 --> 18:34.612
Or, different direction.
I wonder what

18:34.839 --> 18:36.188
the restaurant actually weighs

18:36.357 --> 18:38.932
if one were to rent a
really big crane.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.192
With us in it or not?

18:40.345 --> 18:41.768
Oh, why isn't it
next year already?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.956
Stop... talking...
about... pranks!

18:45.183 --> 18:46.773
Easy, Bob.

18:46.868 --> 18:48.775
What? No-- No. (screams)

18:48.870 --> 18:50.035
(all cry out)

18:50.188 --> 18:52.355
Ah! My dear Bob.

18:52.448 --> 18:53.205
Gotcha.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.191
April Fool's, Mr. Fischoeder.

18:55.209 --> 18:57.301
-The unsightly scaffolding.
-It held.

18:57.528 --> 18:59.879
-Which was not a guarantee.
-How'd you do it?

19:00.031 --> 19:01.046
Well, an hour ago,

19:01.199 --> 19:02.531
I was about to come here
and yell at you.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.958
But I cooled down,
and then it came to me.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.553
The thing you care
about most on April Fool's

19:07.647 --> 19:09.372
-seems to be me.
-Brag.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.315
-So, I should
make myself the prank.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.709
-You've got a lot to work with.
-Thank you.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.987
First I asked Teddy
to move his scaffolding

19:16.214 --> 19:17.062
from the main house to here.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.322
I got lucky because you were

19:18.549 --> 19:19.565
playing with your doves
in the aviary.

19:19.717 --> 19:20.716
So to speak.

19:20.718 --> 19:22.067
Then I called Felix
and asked him

19:22.162 --> 19:23.644
for a second time
to help prank you,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.329
and this time he said yes.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.390
I suggested murder you,
as a joke,

19:27.408 --> 19:28.741
but Bob said it was too big.

19:28.893 --> 19:31.394
His job was to lure you
over here with cocktails.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.337
It was going to be
cocktails and belly dancing,

19:33.564 --> 19:34.914
but I couldn't find
my finger bells.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.174
Linda's job was to bring

19:36.325 --> 19:38.083
the girls
and act sad when I died.

19:38.236 --> 19:41.179
I didn't know it was gonna look
so scary; a little pee came out.

19:41.255 --> 19:43.088
And I told Dad
exactly how to scream.

19:43.241 --> 19:44.423
His natural scream is
much higher.

19:44.592 --> 19:47.243
And Gene knew everything
and never gave it away.

19:47.336 --> 19:48.761
It was hard not
to shout it out,

19:48.913 --> 19:50.579
but I just concentrated
on the cocoa.

19:50.598 --> 19:52.839
Which I still haven't received,
by the way.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.266
Gene, your first
April Fool's prank.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
Well done, Bob.
I felt something.

19:56.512 --> 19:58.604
Aw, see?
We prank 'cause we love.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.424
Next year, you and me.
Same time, different pranks?

20:01.442 --> 20:03.776
You know, we could
just have a beer sometime.

20:03.928 --> 20:04.869
Uh, I don't think so.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.278
Uh, Bob, now that I see it

20:06.431 --> 20:07.872
from this angle,
the scaffolding might be

20:08.099 --> 20:09.406
missing a few bolts.

20:09.559 --> 20:11.358
-What?
-You want to hop back up
on the balcony here?

20:11.436 --> 20:13.568
-Okay. (cries out)
-(all gasp)

20:14.439 --> 20:16.272
-Uh, April Fool's?
-Oh, my God.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.732
Ah, I love this day.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.942
-I'd like to go home.
-Yeah.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.052
Goodbye, burgermongers.

20:21.203 --> 20:22.945
Don't touch anything
on the way out.

20:23.038 --> 20:25.297
Hey, we need to drop Tina off
for her frozen yogurt date.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.949
Wait, what about
all the stuff you said?

20:26.951 --> 20:28.801
I was kinda
April foolin' with you.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.302
I mean, what's the worst
that can happen?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.045
It can't be as bad as Dad's day.

20:32.139 --> 20:33.231
Huh. I guess not.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.899
And like Mom said, sometimes

20:35.050 --> 20:36.717
you prank the people
you like the most.

20:36.811 --> 20:39.311
Seriously?
It's April Fool's Day?

20:39.464 --> 20:40.905
I thought that wasn't until May.

20:41.132 --> 20:42.389
No, it's today. April first.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.316
Oh, is that
why you were so late, Tina?

20:44.469 --> 20:46.277
-Were you pranking me?
-Yes?

20:46.429 --> 20:49.247
-April Fool's?
-Oh, man, you got me.
