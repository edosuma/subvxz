03:42.448 --> 03:44.706
You see, I'm a projection

a very traumatic life event.

(humming happily)

03:52.975 --> 03:56.884
Homer. Homer, what you're
currently experiencing

03:56.886 --> 03:59.238
is called
post-traumatic elation.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.147
-Is that like Post Raisin Bran?
-(grunts)

04:01.149 --> 04:03.575
Damn it, man,
you are literally in the middle

04:03.577 --> 04:05.327
of a car accident!

04:06.914 --> 04:08.822
What?! Oh, right.

04:08.824 --> 04:10.231
Let me lay this out.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.158
You and me are gonna use
this car ejection

04:12.160 --> 04:15.161
for some self-reflection,
okay, my brother?

04:15.163 --> 04:16.162
And that journey begins with

04:16.164 --> 04:17.664
finding the source
of your anger.

04:17.666 --> 04:21.760
Now, gaze into that
little piece of glass.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.265
I need a safe-deposit box.
Want to know why?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.100
Well, that's why I got into
banking in the first place,

04:28.102 --> 04:31.011
for the thrilling stories.

04:31.013 --> 04:33.330
Well, this morning,
I was on my break

04:33.332 --> 04:34.472
-at the nuclear power plant...
-Uh-huh.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.000
...so I went and got myself
a bag of chips.

04:37.002 --> 04:39.336
Potato chips.

04:39.338 --> 04:41.280
I feel like I'm at
a story slam right now.

04:41.282 --> 04:44.007
They were so delicious
and salty and chompy,

04:44.009 --> 04:46.526
and before long,
they were all gone.

04:46.528 --> 04:47.193
-No.
-Almost.

04:47.195 --> 04:49.621
Oh, there's a twist?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.032
But then I pulled out this,

04:52.034 --> 04:55.276
a chip that looks exactly like
John Travolta.

04:55.278 --> 04:58.112
And that's why I need
a safe-deposit box,

04:58.114 --> 05:00.966
to protect this treasure
forever.

05:02.361 --> 05:05.137
Oh, don't study opera staging
in Vienna, they said.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.681
Work in a bank, they said.

05:09.793 --> 05:12.869
Mm-hmm. Mr. Simpson,
it looks like your family

05:12.871 --> 05:15.129
already has a safe-deposit box.

05:15.131 --> 05:17.983
Your wife rented it out
over a decade ago.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.635
-Wow, you've got a wife.
-Wha?

05:20.637 --> 05:21.803
Now, I'm not supposed to
show you this,

05:21.805 --> 05:25.157
but lucky for you right now
I'm super high.

05:25.159 --> 05:28.735
"Last will and testament"?

05:28.737 --> 05:30.996
Written by Clarence Bouvier,
your father-in-law.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.890
Marge's dad left a will?

05:33.892 --> 05:34.908
He never told me about that

05:34.910 --> 05:37.727
in the four conversations
we ever had.

05:37.729 --> 05:39.320
It says here he set up a trust

05:39.322 --> 05:42.248
to pay Marge Simpson,
ooh, $1,000 a month.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.678
A thousand dollars? What? No.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.420
No! What?!

05:47.422 --> 05:50.665
No! No? What?

05:50.667 --> 05:51.850
No.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.593
And I can confirm that
your wife has been

05:53.595 --> 05:56.521
receiving that money every month
since her father died.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.024
Marge has been getting
all that money for years,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.084
and she never told me about it.

06:01.086 --> 06:03.253
I-I don't know what to feel.

06:03.255 --> 06:05.255
In these situations,
many of our customers

06:05.257 --> 06:06.365
opt for extreme rage.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.701
Well, I hate to just
follow the crowd, but...

06:09.703 --> 06:10.535
(growling angrily)

06:10.537 --> 06:13.330
(grumbling, muttering)

06:15.100 --> 06:17.525
So that's why I was so mad.

06:17.527 --> 06:18.952
And that's why
I'm even angrier now.

06:18.954 --> 06:22.864
For all these years, Marge has
been hiding money from me.

06:22.866 --> 06:26.109
It's a blatant act of, of, uh...

06:26.111 --> 06:28.294
The term is
"financial infidelity."

06:28.296 --> 06:30.555
And I can see how
you'd be angry.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.948
Oh, thank you.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.558
-But it's the wrong emotion
to feel.
-Damn it.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.119
Homer, I'm gonna help you
work through this anger

06:36.121 --> 06:38.955
so you can find peace.

06:38.957 --> 06:41.641
Aw, work? That sounds like work.

06:41.643 --> 06:42.809
How much time do I have?

06:42.811 --> 06:44.236
I'd say about
point-three seconds

06:44.463 --> 06:47.221
-judging by how fast
you're flying towards that tree.
-Aah!

06:47.223 --> 06:50.817
Oh, my God, we're airborne.

06:50.819 --> 06:52.661
-Whoa!
-(all scream)

06:58.160 --> 06:59.993
I don't know which one
I'm more upset about,

06:59.995 --> 07:01.161
that my wife has been keeping

07:01.163 --> 07:02.754
a secret mountain of cash
from me,

07:02.756 --> 07:06.073
or that I'm about to die
in a stupid, violent car wreck.

07:06.075 --> 07:08.001
Don't make me choose,
Goobie-Woo.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.928
(Homer crying out)

07:09.930 --> 07:11.078
Homer, you're spiraling.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.323
Of course I'm spiraling.

07:13.325 --> 07:15.825
I'm literally flying
through the air.

07:15.827 --> 07:18.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:18.330 --> 07:21.347
Listen, I know you're feeling
all the feels right now,

07:21.349 --> 07:23.349
but we're getting closer
to the real source of your rage.

07:23.351 --> 07:27.279
What? I'm sorry,
I'm eating my feelings.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.523
Bad Homer. Spit out that food,
and those feelings.

07:30.525 --> 07:33.267
(grunts) What was Marge
spending that money on?

07:33.269 --> 07:36.029
And why did she keep it a secret
from everybody?

07:36.031 --> 07:38.198
LISA:
Um, not everybody, Dad.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.107
I hate to say it,
but we've known about

07:40.109 --> 07:42.127
Mom's secret cash
for quite some time.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.130
Yeah, that's why I laugh myself
to sleep every night.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.799
What? And here I've been
worried sick about

07:47.801 --> 07:49.042
your night giggles.

07:49.044 --> 07:51.303
Let me tell you
how we found out.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.306
<i> I was blowing off steam</i>
<i> one day...</i>

07:58.962 --> 08:02.647
<i> ...and I saw that Mom was</i>
<i> getting $100,000 a month!</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:05.400
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> Then I explained to Bart</i>
<i> how decimal points work.</i>

08:08.213 --> 08:10.897
<i> Then we asked Mom about it,</i>
<i> and she admitted</i>

08:10.899 --> 08:12.324
the whole thing.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.720
So then tell me, why did she
keep the money a secret?

08:16.722 --> 08:17.996
I don't think you can handle it.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.223
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

08:20.225 --> 08:21.891
<i> The reason is...</i>

08:21.910 --> 08:24.669
<i> (imitating Marge):</i>
<i> Your father is</i>
<i> an ape-faced butt monster</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:27.822
<i> who eats booger sandwiches</i>
<i> and also sucks.</i>

08:27.824 --> 08:29.323

08:29.325 --> 08:32.827
Why, you little
unreliable narrator!

08:32.829 --> 08:35.180
Ow! Glass is sharp.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.499
Oh, even my kids knew
I was being fiscally unmanned.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.260
(normal voice):
Okay, got to go, ape face.

08:40.262 --> 08:41.578
See you at your funeral.

08:41.671 --> 08:44.505
We'll be the kids running around
in our nice clothes,

08:44.507 --> 08:47.341

08:53.182 --> 08:54.366

just yet.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.035
Don't you want to find out
what Marge been

08:57.037 --> 08:58.703
spending the money on?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.521
Oh, you bet I do.

09:00.523 --> 09:03.266
Well, that's what I thought.
Give me your best guess.

09:03.268 --> 09:04.284
I want to give her
the benefit of the doubt,

09:04.286 --> 09:08.438
but I can't help
but imagine the worst.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.441

If anything, you should be mad
at Marge's dad.

-Huh?
-Oh, snap,
I shouldn't have said that.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.043

11:52.045 --> 11:54.713

Nothing. And closure! (chuckles)

11:57.108 --> 11:59.200
Closure-closure,
closure-closure.

11:59.202 --> 12:01.535
Oh, no. I got to know
what Marge's dad did,

12:01.537 --> 12:02.795
or said or rapped.

12:02.797 --> 12:07.283
Aha, and I've got
the magical footage right here.

12:07.285 --> 12:09.619
Don't look at it!
You've come so far.

12:09.621 --> 12:12.063
Inner peace has almost defeated
your outer rage.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.307
You've got to be strong, man.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.626
So if I look at
that piece of glass,

12:16.628 --> 12:17.902
I could change my fate

12:17.904 --> 12:19.887
and perhaps even risk
my very soul?

12:19.889 --> 12:22.389
Well, I'm cool with that.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.299
What the hell?!

12:23.392 --> 12:26.077
But, Dad,
Homer has a good heart,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.246
and I'm going to marry him.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.231
Oh, honey, this Simpson fellow
will never provide for you.

12:30.233 --> 12:33.101
He has jackass written
all over him.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.736
Marge, do you have
any turpentine?

12:35.738 --> 12:37.505
It's not coming off.

12:37.832 --> 12:39.816
Hmm.

12:39.818 --> 12:43.002
His friends did that
after he fell asleep at a party.

12:43.004 --> 12:46.005
Homer's the sweetest person
I've ever met.

12:46.007 --> 12:47.490
Every time I look into his eyes,

12:47.492 --> 12:50.918
I see someone who will
never stop loving me.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.921
Oh... crap.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.332
Look, I'm gonna leave you
something special in my will

12:56.334 --> 12:58.167
to make sure you're okay,
because you've found

12:58.169 --> 12:59.927
every father's worst nightmare:

12:59.929 --> 13:04.098
true love with a true loser.

13:04.100 --> 13:07.026
Loser? But I thought
Marge's dad liked me.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.936
He was always warning me about

13:08.938 --> 13:10.955
doors hitting my butt
on the way out.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.107
How dare he emasculate me
from beyond the grave?

13:13.109 --> 13:16.795
Uh-huh. I told you
not to look at it.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.630
Wait, how could I remember
that talk

13:18.632 --> 13:21.299
between Marge and her dad
if I wasn't around to see it?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.636
You can see stuff like that
'cause you're a ghost now.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.471
You dead.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.456
(ghostlike):
D'oh...!

13:29.458 --> 13:31.384
I tried to tell you,
and you didn't want to hear me.

13:31.386 --> 13:35.204
You was eating your feelings
and carrying on.

13:35.206 --> 13:37.148
Goobie-Woo knows what's good.

13:38.226 --> 13:40.527
I'm gonna see this
in every dream now.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.566
Oh, my God, I'm in heaven now.

13:46.568 --> 13:49.052
It's so huge, so majestic.

13:49.054 --> 13:50.662
So red.

13:52.481 --> 13:55.149
Ooh, it's one of heaven's
goaty-footed angels.

13:55.151 --> 13:56.650
And look at that giant fork.

13:56.652 --> 14:00.654
Probably for eating
delicious, heavenly s'mores.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.231
Think again, pally.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.842
-(flesh sizzles)
-Ow!

14:03.844 --> 14:05.492
Wait a second, I'm in hell?
But why?

14:05.494 --> 14:08.329
Because you committed
the deadly sin of wrath

14:08.331 --> 14:10.664
against your father-in-law.

14:10.666 --> 14:14.168
So what? Everybody hates
everybody these days.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.262
Plus the rest of
the seven deadly sins

14:16.264 --> 14:19.357
all in the last half second
of your life.

14:33.098 --> 14:35.114

16:21.222 --> 16:23.314
What Marge's dad did to me
was super-sucky.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.375
It's probably the reason
he ended up here.

16:26.377 --> 16:28.060
Actually, he ended up here
thanks to an unrelated

to meet Mercer.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.256
Oh, like Parker Brothers?

16:57.258 --> 17:00.259

Yeah, like Parker Brothers. No.

17:00.261 --> 17:03.354
You actually play that
mainstream corporate garbage?

17:09.420 --> 17:12.196
My new game
is gonna be a huge hit.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.424
It combines the Stratego-ness
of Stratego,

17:15.426 --> 17:18.611
the implicit sexual tension
of Twister,

17:18.613 --> 17:21.873
and the hard-driving whimsy
of Tic-Tac-Toe.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.100
It's called Side-gammon.

17:24.102 --> 17:27.128
Who's up for a game? Huh?

17:28.439 --> 17:30.030

17:33.369 --> 17:35.444
and you'll be humiliated!

17:35.446 --> 17:37.889

I have to go yell something

17:37.891 --> 17:40.283

Wait, I was never as bad

that guy to you.

18:01.139 --> 18:02.488

-and it's not bad.
-Oh, my God.

other people had those.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.425
You were just worried

Ah.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.636
I guess I can go another month
without a new purse.

You see, I'm a projection
of your psyche,

20:44.727 --> 20:46.226
and you're in the middle of

20:46.228 --> 20:49.229
-a very traumatic life event.
-LISA: And cut.

20:49.231 --> 20:50.748
Now we should move on
to the part

20:50.750 --> 20:52.566
where your character slaps Dad.

20:52.568 --> 20:53.900
Wait a minute,
isn't that just a sound effect?

20:53.902 --> 20:57.646
No, it's got to be real.
Right, Lizzo?

20:57.648 --> 21:01.908
Uh, seems a bit excessive to me,
but, hey, pshh, you're the kid.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.928
You know what?
If you're uncomfortable,

21:03.930 --> 21:06.171
-you don't have to do it.
-(Homer sighs)

21:06.173 --> 21:08.582
I could do it for you.
And action!

21:08.584 --> 21:11.269
-(grunts)
-Maybe a few more for safety?

21:11.271 --> 21:12.495
(Homer grunting)

21:12.497 --> 21:15.422
Whose safety? (grunts)
I don't feel safe!

21:15.424 --> 21:18.167
-(rhythmic slapping)
-Ow. Ow.

21:18.169 --> 21:19.518
Why, you little...

21:19.520 --> 21:20.669
-This beat is fire.
-(Homer continues grunting)

21:20.671 --> 21:23.839
Yo, Lisa, how 'bout
I get Sasha Flute,

21:23.841 --> 21:25.841
you get your saxamaphone,

21:25.843 --> 21:27.843
and we, uh, jam?

21:27.845 --> 21:29.528
I'd love to.

21:29.530 --> 21:31.847
-(playing<i> Simpsons</i> theme)
-Ow. Ow.

21:31.849 --> 21:34.500
Ow. Stop that.

21:35.853 --> 21:37.778
Ow. Ow.

21:37.780 --> 21:41.507
Ow. Ow. Ow.

21:43.027 --> 21:44.860
Why, you little...

21:44.862 --> 21:46.862
Ow.

21:46.864 --> 21:48.264

21:49.291 --> 21:50.141
Shh!
