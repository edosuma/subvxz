WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:04.820
Darling, I probably shouldn't
be writing to you,

00:04.920 --> 00:07.179
but I can't get you out of my mind.

00:07.180 --> 00:12.189
That weekend we spent in the mart, was
the most powerful experience of my life.

00:12.190 --> 00:15.349
You were the most perfect
man that was ever created,

00:15.350 --> 00:17.199
and I must have you.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.000
Uh, what are you doing?

00:19.060 --> 00:20.130
Reading a letter.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.830
That's not addressed to you.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.570
Oh, is that a crime?

00:23.640 --> 00:26.270
Yes. This is your mail.

00:26.340 --> 00:29.610
Look, here's a 20 spot if you
give me back the letter.

00:29.670 --> 00:33.110
Bribing a government official
is also a crime.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.480
And is this counterfeit money?

00:35.550 --> 00:38.650
What? You're gonna tell me
that's a crime, too?

00:38.720 --> 00:41.220
Last time I checked,
I was living in America.

00:41.290 --> 00:43.620
Ooh! Look over there!

00:43.690 --> 00:46.860
[Screaming]

00:53.030 --> 00:57.300
See what happens when you people
don't let me read your mail?!

00:57.370 --> 00:59.700
Soon as I can make
a counterfeit passport,

00:59.770 --> 01:02.470
I'm moving to Mexico.

01:06.760 --> 01:13.010

01:25.960 --> 01:29.230
Restraining order.
Medical bill.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.740
Invitation to my
high school reunion.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.400
Another restraining order.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.010
What are you throwing
that out for?

01:35.070 --> 01:38.140
You can't restrain me.
I'm a free spirit.

01:38.210 --> 01:41.250
Not that, the invitation to
your high school reunion.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.950
A bunch of people
standing around

01:43.010 --> 01:45.580
talking about their babies
and their minivans?

01:45.650 --> 01:47.320
Huh. Sounds thrilling.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.690
You should be excited
to go to your reunion.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.490
You always said high school was
the greatest time of your life.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.430
Hmm, that's true.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.260
High school was epic.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.300
I remember it like it
was yesterday.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.930
There were 3 seconds left,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.970
and everyone knew I was
taking the last shot.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.270
[Stammering]
Hi, I'm P-P-Porky Pig.

02:09.340 --> 02:10.509
Yeah, that's great.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.080
I'm Daffy Duck,
the guy who didn't ask.

02:13.140 --> 02:14.810
Now beat it!

02:14.880 --> 02:17.480
Now, where was I? Oh, right.

02:17.550 --> 02:20.820
So I get the ball.
The clock starts ticking.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.520
3, 2...Nothing but net.

02:24.590 --> 02:26.020
[Girls giggling]

02:26.090 --> 02:29.690
Daffy Duck gets
all the pretty girls.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.400
Is this seat taken?

02:31.460 --> 02:36.030
No, it's right there.
You're looking right at it.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.800
Greetings.

02:37.870 --> 02:41.440
I'm Marvin the foreign
exchange student.

02:41.510 --> 02:43.970
Oh. Where are you from?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.180
Mars.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.780
Well, ladies, I'd better
get to class.

02:48.850 --> 02:51.520
Those straight "a"s aren't
going to make themselves.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.420
[Girls giggling]

02:53.490 --> 02:54.620
Hi, daffy.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.520
Well, aren't you sweet?

02:56.590 --> 02:58.690
In fact, the only thing
sweeter than you

02:58.760 --> 03:00.360
is that cake over there.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.860
Hey, cake for the lady!

03:01.930 --> 03:03.830
You know what?
Cake for everybody!

03:03.900 --> 03:05.460
It's on me.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.700
[Cheering]

03:10.040 --> 03:11.900
Are you nerds
enjoying the cake?

03:11.970 --> 03:13.500
It's stupendous.

03:13.570 --> 03:14.810
Yum!

03:14.870 --> 03:16.310
Is that really on you?

03:16.370 --> 03:18.640
No, it's on you!

03:18.710 --> 03:20.710
[Laughing]

03:20.780 --> 03:23.250
Daffy Duck! Daffy Duck!

03:23.310 --> 03:25.750
Daffy Duck! Daffy Duck!

03:25.820 --> 03:28.720
Yech, I bet Porky's
not going to the reunion.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.520
But you were
the big man on campus.

03:30.590 --> 03:32.190
Why wouldn't you want to go?

03:32.260 --> 03:33.520
Look at my life now.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.390
I live in a dump. No offense.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.830
I have a stupid roommate.
No offense.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.800
And I've piled up tons of
credit card debt. No offense.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.830
Why would I take offense
to that?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.940
Because I used
your credit car.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.070
The point is I peaked
in high school!

03:48.140 --> 03:50.940
At least you got to go
to high school.

03:51.010 --> 03:53.110
You didn't go to high school?

03:53.180 --> 03:56.910
Let's just say my youth
was unconventional.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.250
What was so unconventional
about your youth?

03:59.320 --> 04:00.980
It's not important.

04:01.050 --> 04:04.620
My unconventional, incomparable,
inimitable youth

04:04.690 --> 04:07.290
is not important.
What is important

04:07.360 --> 04:09.060
is that you attend
this reunion.

04:09.130 --> 04:11.060
Why do you want me to go
to my reunion so bad?

04:11.130 --> 04:13.560
Because you can.
Don't you see?

04:13.630 --> 04:17.029
You have the opportunity to do
something I can only dream of:

04:17.100 --> 04:20.000
Stand around with people
you barely remember,

04:20.070 --> 04:22.110
reminiscing about the big game,

04:22.170 --> 04:24.710
senior prom, homework!

04:24.780 --> 04:25.840
You're weird.

04:25.910 --> 04:28.150
All right, the reunion's
on Saturday,

04:28.210 --> 04:31.220
which means you have a whole week
to make something out of your life.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.020
I can't make something
of my life in 5 days.

04:35.090 --> 04:36.990
You can with my help,

04:37.060 --> 04:38.820
and a week is 7 days.

04:38.890 --> 04:41.430
5. I'm not letting this
cut into my weekend.

04:41.490 --> 04:45.560
That's my "me time."
I'll see you on Monday morning.

04:45.630 --> 04:48.670
Eh, that's a little ambitious.
Monday afternoon.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.800
You know what? Nothing ever
gets done on a Monday.

04:50.870 --> 04:54.300
Let's start Tuesday, noon...

04:54.370 --> 04:55.870
Ish.

05:03.540 --> 05:06.600
This is you in high school,
which I don't need to remind you

05:06.670 --> 05:08.010
I never got to go to.

05:08.070 --> 05:09.740
And this is you now.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.210
There's only 4 days
until your reunion.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.480
A reunion that I would love
to attend, by the way.

05:15.550 --> 05:19.550
So we don't have much time
to get you from here to here.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.220
How do we do it?

05:21.290 --> 05:23.090
Hmm, let me think.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.760
You've got to do something
special, something admirable,

05:26.830 --> 05:28.690
something heroic.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.230
Like destroy the earth!

05:31.300 --> 05:34.270
More like, I don't know,
climb mount Everest?

05:34.330 --> 05:36.200
[Gasps] That's it!

05:36.270 --> 05:41.540
Everyone at the reunion would
hail the conquering hero!

05:41.610 --> 05:44.780
[Screams echoing]

05:46.110 --> 05:47.710
[Hisses]

05:47.780 --> 05:50.510
You know what? I can't
climb mount Everest

05:50.580 --> 05:52.680
because I don't have
a winter jacket.

05:52.750 --> 05:53.720
- You could buy.
- Nope.

05:53.790 --> 05:55.320
- You could borrow.
- Nope.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.320
I can't climb mount Everest

05:57.390 --> 05:59.660
because I don't have
a winter jacket.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.930
Shame. Well, I think
that was a good day one.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.330
Same time tomorrow?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.860
Probably not tomorrow.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.800
I'm pretty blown out.
Let's shoot for Thursday.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.000
You know what?
I have a thing on Thursday.

06:11.070 --> 06:14.410
Friday, I swear.
See you Saturday!

06:18.210 --> 06:19.940
So when's this reunion again?

06:20.010 --> 06:21.510
It's tonight.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.380
What?! What have you been
doing this whole time?

06:24.450 --> 06:26.650
I guess I'm not going
to my reunion.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.420
We've got to go!
I mean you've got to go.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.190
And there's still
something you can do

06:31.260 --> 06:33.460
to impress everyone
at the reunion.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.790
And it's not destroy the earth.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.760
Then what is it?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.370
I'm ruining my manicure.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.970
Give me your quarter.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.870
I'm starting to think the odds of
winning the lottery are pretty low.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.210
[Gasps] Three sixes?
Three sixes!

06:50.280 --> 06:53.680
I won! I won the lottery!
I'm rich!

06:53.750 --> 06:55.380
We can go to your reunion!

06:55.450 --> 06:57.380
I mean you can go
to your reunion.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.020
I'm so happy for you!

06:59.080 --> 07:01.520
Happy and jealous!
Mostly jealous!

07:01.590 --> 07:05.890
Ha ha! I'm rich! I'm rich!

07:05.960 --> 07:09.090
I knew I didn't peak
in high school!

07:09.160 --> 07:11.830
Daffy, you didn't get
three sixes.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.270
You were holding it upside-down.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.230
You got three nines.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.100
Besides, you were playing
lucky eights.

07:20.170 --> 07:23.170
This is hopeless.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.010
Excuse me. Do you have
a quarter for the parking meter?

07:26.080 --> 07:26.940
No.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.610
But you're holding a quarter.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.780
What, this?
This isn't a quarter.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.150
That's not a quarter?

07:32.220 --> 07:33.720
No. This is a fake.

07:33.790 --> 07:36.190
I'm agent Jimmy Glass,
and this is agent Ira Buttles,

07:36.250 --> 07:38.020
and we're with
the treasury department.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.290
We're investigating a highly illegal
counterfeit operation in the area.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.190
I'm gonna need to see
your wallet.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.860
Oh! Uh, of course.

07:46.930 --> 07:49.230
Yep, this one looks
a little iffy.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.700
Gonna have to run some tests.
Now get out of here.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.540
But keep your eyes
and ears open!

07:53.610 --> 07:56.270
That's it! I thought
in order to go to the reunion,

07:56.340 --> 07:59.540
you needed to be someone
you're not: A success.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.650
But it turns out
you should just go

08:01.710 --> 08:04.980
as someone you
already are: A liar.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.880
You want me to go
to the reunion

08:06.950 --> 08:09.690
and just lie about
how successful I am?

08:09.760 --> 08:12.190
That's a horrible idea!

08:12.260 --> 08:15.790
I'm lying. It's a great idea.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.330
Or was <i>that</i> a lie?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.870
This lying could get
out of control.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.830
Or is <i>that</i> a lie?

08:23.900 --> 08:27.340
The lying is in control!

08:27.410 --> 08:30.210
Oh, brudder.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.640
Well, after high school,

08:32.710 --> 08:34.650
I just had to
get away from it all,

08:34.710 --> 08:37.750
get back to what's important:
The land.

08:37.820 --> 08:38.780
[Ding]

08:38.850 --> 08:41.750
I've got about 30,000 acres
in Montana.

08:41.820 --> 08:42.789
[Ding]

08:42.850 --> 08:45.760
Probably about 50,000
head of cattle.

08:45.820 --> 08:46.890
[Ding]

08:46.960 --> 08:50.800
That's about 2 heads
of cattle per acre. Yeah.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.000
[Ding]

08:52.060 --> 08:54.530
I love a cattle drive.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.670
[Ding]

08:55.730 --> 08:57.370
Too much spitting.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.740
I signed up after graduation.

08:59.810 --> 09:03.240
I heard the call of duty,
and I answered.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.740
Oh, this?

09:04.810 --> 09:08.510
What you call heroism,
I call duty.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.950
Believe me, when you're
doing your duty,

09:11.020 --> 09:13.820
you don't think about the fact
that you're doing your duty.

09:13.890 --> 09:16.220
It's your duty. You just do it.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.690
You do your duty.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.190
Too much saying
the word "duty."

09:21.260 --> 09:23.630
[Gruff voice] I'm Batman.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.100
So what lie did you settle on?

09:28.170 --> 09:30.870
One lie is too limiting.

09:30.940 --> 09:34.210
It's gonna be a big reunion.
I can tell a lot of lies.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.470
That couldn't
possibly backfire.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.710
What are you saying?

09:37.780 --> 09:41.350
Well, if I were you,
I'd bring someone along

09:41.410 --> 09:43.850
to help you keep track
of all those lies.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.780
But who would want to go
to someone else's reunion?

09:46.850 --> 09:49.890
Me! I want to go
to your reunion!

09:49.960 --> 09:54.120
You? Then why didn't you
say something earlier?

09:54.190 --> 09:57.130
[Music playing]

09:57.200 --> 09:58.800
Just stay close.

09:58.860 --> 10:03.800
The lies are about
to get complicated.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.800
Name?

10:04.870 --> 10:07.570
Count Leopold Von Lichtenstein.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.210
How do you spell that?

10:09.270 --> 10:10.540
Bob Jones.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.210
Well, which one is it?

10:12.280 --> 10:13.740
Uh, both!

10:13.810 --> 10:15.880
Eh, maybe ease into the lies.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.320
This is him.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.120
Whew, that was close.

10:20.190 --> 10:23.050
Promise me you won't leave
my side the rest of the night.

in homeroom together.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.420
Oh, hey, Tanya.
Long time no see.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.720
Whatcha been up to?

12:05.790 --> 12:08.890
Me? Oh, I, uh—uh—

12:08.960 --> 12:10.130
- are you married?

12:10.190 --> 12:13.230
Married? Uh, yes,
happily married.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.800
Very happily married,
to a model.

12:15.870 --> 12:17.930
Wow. Any kids?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.070
Two kids. Boy and a girl.
Tegan and Cassidy.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.340
Also models.

12:22.410 --> 12:25.170
Gee. Well, it's great
to see you.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.710
It's great to see you, Tanya!

12:27.780 --> 12:30.780
What was I so worried about?
I don't need bugs.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.120
Heh heh! Elliot Howser.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.680
Oh, Heidi Gardner.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.050

any of these people.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.060
[Gasps] Andy Friedman.

12:44.130 --> 12:48.400
Did you hear that Daffy Duck won
a bronze medal at the Olympics?

12:48.470 --> 12:52.000
[Gasps] I'm supposed to be
keeping track of Daffy's lies!

12:52.070 --> 12:55.570
And instead, I've been standing
around drinking punch.

12:59.210 --> 13:03.510
Well, I'm now the head of a very
profitable non-profit organization.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.250
I used to be a pro surfer,

13:05.320 --> 13:07.980
but after the shark attack,
I had an epiphany

13:08.050 --> 13:11.390
and decided to dedicate my life
to the betterment of society.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.560
And I'm also a model.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.730
Sorry, Daff. Ok, what lies
have you told so far?

13:16.790 --> 13:20.200
Bugs, relax.
I've got this under control.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.330
Really?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.830
Easy breezy.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.270
It's like stealing babies
from a candy store.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.040
Go enjoy the reunion.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.710
I don't know. I think you
might need my—

13:29.770 --> 13:34.710
[gasps] Is that somebody else's
old algebra teacher?

13:34.780 --> 13:37.380
Pete! Marvin!

13:37.450 --> 13:39.380
What have you guys been up to?

13:39.450 --> 13:43.190
Ohh. High school was
a horrible time for me.

13:43.250 --> 13:47.320
Therefore, I have spent every
moment since graduation

13:47.390 --> 13:49.760
plotting to destroy the earth.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.190
Heh. I hope you have better
luck with that than I did.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.600
What about you, Pete?

13:53.660 --> 13:57.070
Oh, I'm still waiting
to graduate.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.630
What about you?

13:58.700 --> 14:01.570
I'm the starting quarterback
for the Dallas cowboys.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.240
I thought you said you owned
the Dallas cowboys.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.040
Oh, uh, yeah.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.940
That's—uh, I—

14:08.010 --> 14:09.650
- well, which is it?

14:09.710 --> 14:13.020
Uh...Uh...
Ooh, look over there!

14:13.080 --> 14:16.250
[Dance music playing]

14:28.430 --> 14:29.530
Bugs!

14:29.600 --> 14:32.700
Hi. I've heard you've become
a famous movie star.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.300
Can I have your autograph?

14:34.370 --> 14:35.800
Oh, uh, sure.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.670
I've never had my picture
taken with an astronaut before.

14:38.740 --> 14:39.910
Do you mind?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.240
You're an astronaut, too?

14:42.310 --> 14:45.150
Well, uh, before I was
a movie star, I was—

14:45.220 --> 14:48.180
- Batman, come quick!
There's a break-in at the museum!

14:48.250 --> 14:49.790
- Batman?
- Batman?

14:49.850 --> 14:54.390
Wait, are you saying this man,
the president of Mexico,

14:54.460 --> 14:55.990
is Batman?

14:56.060 --> 15:00.000
[All talking at once]

15:00.060 --> 15:03.270
[Music playing]

15:03.330 --> 15:05.270
He's so cute.

15:05.340 --> 15:07.840
I don't remember him
from high school.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.040
[Stammering] Bugs,
wh-what are you doing here?

15:11.110 --> 15:14.280
I'm here with Daffy.
What are you doing here?

15:14.340 --> 15:15.840
From the story I heard,

15:15.910 --> 15:17.850
high school was pretty
rough for you.

15:17.910 --> 15:20.720
Rough? Ha ha ha ha!

15:20.780 --> 15:23.420
High school was the greatest
time in my life.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.020
I'm surprised Daffy came.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.190
Huh?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.190
Porky!

15:29.260 --> 15:30.930
Hey!

15:33.260 --> 15:36.200
Excuse me, but do you
remember Daffy Duck?

15:36.270 --> 15:37.370
Who?

15:37.430 --> 15:40.370
Daffy Duck. Come on,
you gotta remember him.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.510
He was the coolest guy
at your high school.

15:43.570 --> 15:46.710
Daffy Duck. You know,
black feathers, big beak,

15:46.780 --> 15:48.210
about this tall.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.880
Oh! You mean Daffy Dork.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.880
Ew, that guy was such a nerd!

15:53.950 --> 15:56.420
[Both giggling]

15:56.490 --> 15:58.250
I've been looking
all over for you!

15:58.320 --> 16:01.460
My web of lies has entangled
me in a web of lies.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.490
In high school, were you
ever called Daffy Dork?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.160
Daffy Dork?

16:06.230 --> 16:11.070
Why would anyone call the coolest
guy in high school Daffy D—[Gasps]

16:14.200 --> 16:15.900
[Stammering]
There were 3 seconds left,

16:15.970 --> 16:18.740
and everyone knew I was
taking the last shot.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.780
Hi, I'm Daffy Duck.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.350
Yeah, that's great.
I'm the guy who didn't ask.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.420
Now beat it.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.750
Is this seat taken?

16:32.190 --> 16:35.190
Cake for everybody!
It's on me!

16:35.260 --> 16:37.430
[Cheering]

16:40.900 --> 16:42.870
Hey, nerd, are you
enjoying the cake?

16:42.930 --> 16:45.930
It's delicious.
Is it really on you?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.870
No, it's on you.

16:49.940 --> 16:54.110
Daffy Dork! Daffy Dork!
Daffy Dork!

16:54.180 --> 16:56.710
[Laughing]

17:00.120 --> 17:03.820
So this means I wasn't
the big man on campus.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.560
I was the big dork on campus!

17:06.619 --> 17:09.390
Wow, I really am a liar.

17:09.460 --> 17:13.130
And the greatest lie I ever told
was to myself.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.300
Wait! Don't you see?
This is good news.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.640
You'd thought you'd gone
from here to here,

17:19.700 --> 17:22.500
but it turns out
you never went anywhere.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.270
What's good about that?

17:24.339 --> 17:26.740
It means you
haven't peaked yet.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.550
[Gasps] You're right.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.450
You hear that, you losers?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.980
I didn't peak in high school!

17:34.050 --> 17:37.050
But you did! And you did!

17:37.120 --> 17:40.090
And you certainly did!

17:40.160 --> 17:44.160
Daffy, I've apologized
a thousand times.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.900
And you! You used to be
the prettiest girl in school,

17:47.960 --> 17:49.730
and now you're—

17:49.800 --> 17:51.970
well, you're still
very beautiful.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.470
The point is you all
peaked too soon.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.170
Except for you. So long, jerks!

17:57.240 --> 17:59.780
I'm off, and unlike you,

17:59.840 --> 18:03.110
I have nowhere to go but up.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.280
Aah!

18:05.350 --> 18:09.350
Daffy Dork! Daffy Dork!
Daffy Dork!

18:09.420 --> 18:13.920
Daffy Dork! Daffy Dork!
It's got a ring to it.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.860
Daffy Dork! Daffy Dork!

20:49.180 --> 20:51.280
I may have missed out
on high school,

20:51.350 --> 20:55.950
but I got to go to one heck
of a high school reunion.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.890
Oh! Home movies from
my unconventional youth.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.520
I haven't seen these
in a while.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.700
[Poignant music playing]

21:26.220 --> 21:28.950
You were
the president of Mexico?

21:29.020 --> 21:30.290
Eh, interim.

21:30.350 --> 21:33.720
You did all that instead
of going to high school?

21:33.790 --> 21:36.260
Do you know what this means?

21:36.330 --> 21:39.330
