Machiavelli! You've told me nothing
I don't already know!

Sun Tzu's The Art of War.

LOIS: Stewie, those books aren't
for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies.

00:14.389 --> 00:18.227
How dare you! That book may hold the key
to my enslaving of all mankind.

Tickle.

00:22.481 --> 00:26.527

of the other guy from Wham.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.332
I'm free! Free from the spell
of those diabolical Teletubbies!

00:40.415 --> 00:44.253
Thank you. When the world is mine,

Tomorrow is softball practice. We have
a lot of work to do for Saturday's game.

and their stupid glasses.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.555
Oh, man. I hate those guys.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.267
More than I hate spinach, traffic jams,
and the last few years of M*A*S*H.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.519
When Alan Alda took over
behind the camera...

01:42.603 --> 01:44.605
...and the show
got all dramatic and preachy?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.231
Am I right? Who's with me?

01:46.315 --> 01:49.693
This year we will defeat those Pranksters

he'll be an asset to our company...

MR. WEED:
You have impeccable credentials.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.127
I'm sure I can find a position
for you somewhere.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.670
Back to work, people.

02:08.754 --> 02:12.341
PETER: Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for
a new line of TV action figures.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.136
Facts of Life Transformers, huh?
Watch the transformation.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.846
Cute as a button...

02:17.930 --> 02:19.389
...fat as a cow...

02:19.473 --> 02:24.228

Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.271
-I'll consider it.
-He'll consider it!

PAT: You got it.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.412
Well, you were close, Dad.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.916
Yeah. I still can't believe we missed
the phrase, "My hairy aunt."

02:46.291 --> 02:48.252
Come on, Brian.
I gotta get to softball practice.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.755
Practice? I thought we'd go next door
and welcome our new neighbors.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.299
No. I don't want anything to do
with neighbors.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.469
Last guy who lived next door
borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.431
If that slut wants full custody
of the kids, she's got it.

[Short-circuiting]

03:03.934 --> 03:06.186
Peter, they might be very nice people.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.730
"Very nice people."
Yeah, that's what they always say.

03:08.814 --> 03:12.609
Then you open up the septic tank and...
Skeleton city!

[Panting]

03:18.407 --> 03:19.658

Don't flatter yourself, honey.
I don't have any sweat glands.

MR. WEED: Okay, time for batting practice,
my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.875
Guillermo, you're up.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.920
Unfortunately Johnson isn't here
to pitch today. His wife is in labor.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.882
Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him?
Jeez, I'll pitch.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.842
I don't know what's more questionable,

03:36.925 --> 03:39.052

or Bill Clinton's integrity.

Oh, how hard--

03:51.982 --> 03:55.235
-Okay. Take your base.
-Somebody call 911.

Tell them he is allergic to penicillin
and white zinfandel!

Idiot! If you don't find a ringer
to replace Guillermo, you're fired!

04:03.410 --> 04:06.747
Man. What'll I do if I get fired?
I'll have to go back to my old job...

PETER: What was the name
of the bad guy from Tron?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.303
This is gonna drive me nuts!

LOIS: Moving is never easy on a family.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.643
Well, we are gonna miss
the go-go-go pace of Providence.

04:27.809 --> 04:31.146
But with number two on the way,
Joe thought it was time to move.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.942
And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.111
Quahog can be pretty exciting, too.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.614
Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.

I-17. Darn it.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.285

04:45.911 --> 04:48.038
I haven't played Bingo in years!

04:48.288 --> 04:52.417
Silence! Ever since you two met,
you've done nothing but wax idiotic!

04:52.501 --> 04:54.670
I must escape this infernal babble!

04:55.879 --> 04:57.881
[Chuckles] What a little explorer.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.008
Yes. He's so full of wonder.

BONNIE: Joe, you have to meet
our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.476
It's a pleasure, Lois.
Who's the little guy?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.146
This is Stewie.
Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.065
You will bow to me.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.904
MEG: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.074
I know.
I've admired you in the garden from afar.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.368
-Will you go out with me?
-I'd love to.

Get out of here, you mouth breather!

05:32.291 --> 05:33.709
PETER: I'm as good as fired.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.670
Where the hell am I gonna find a guy
as strong as Guillermo?

05:36.753 --> 05:40.716
One time I walked into the locker room,
I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.178
PETER: Great. Lois is getting chummy
with the new neighbors.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.140
BRIAN: She wants you to meet them.
PETER: She's always making me be social.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.852
Cocktail parties, school functions,
that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.440
What? Look, all I'm saying is
put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy...

05:56.523 --> 05:58.400
...and I can't tell the difference.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.987
-You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
-Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.823
You got a neighbor
on the other side of your house, too.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.201
So, don't think you always have to bug me.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.537
I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have
a screwdriver I can borrow?

06:10.621 --> 06:13.749
Man, you neighbors are like viruses.
Starts with a screwdriver.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.084
Before you know it,
you're using my supermarket...

06:16.168 --> 06:18.253
...my dry cleaner, and even my postman.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.965
Can you believe that guy?
"Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"

06:22.049 --> 06:23.050
What an ass.

06:24.635 --> 06:28.555
-Did you find a replacement for the team?
-No. Believe me, I've been looking.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.058
Hideo-san would be honored to play
for your team.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.602
But he wishes to know
what compensation you offer.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.730
Me love you long time.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.733
Gosh, I'd like to help.
But I've gotta go out in the hall...

06:39.816 --> 06:41.777
...and chew on my ass for five minutes.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.988
LOIS: Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie
to your game on Saturday.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.407
Lois, I don't want those people there.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.911
See, this is why I ask you to submit
everything to me in writing first.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.831
Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan.
He played in college.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.333
He did?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.918
Welcome to the neighborhood.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.002
Hiya, Joe.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.379
-Peter!
-Don't get up.

07:00.462 --> 07:03.173
This is a surprise.
I kinda thought you didn't like me.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.717
What? Because of what I said
this afternoon. No.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.762
See I have that disease
where stuff pops out of your mouth.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.181
Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.183
I'm so sorry.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.104
I thought maybe I crossed the line
when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.524
Are you kidding?
You can borrow whatever you want.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.652
Great. Say, you don't happen
to have any picture wire, do you?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.154
Picture wire? You son of a bitch.

[Dreamy ringing]

07:27.823 --> 07:30.367
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
There it goes again.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.827
I don't want to impose.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.872
No problem. That's what neighbors do.
You know what else they do?

07:34.955 --> 07:38.000
They play on their neighbor's company
softball team like this Saturday.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.586
PETER: What do you say, neighbor?
JOE: Sounds fun.

07:40.669 --> 07:44.464
So much fun it should be illegal
like copyright infringement.

-Thanks.

-That was joke gum.
-What do you mean?

08:04.568 --> 08:06.820
MR. WEED:
It's nice that your family is here.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.490
If your ringer doesn't arrive soon,
you can spend every day with them...

08:10.574 --> 08:11.700
...at home.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.578
He'll be here, Mr. Weed.
You should see this guy in action.

What's he doing in a wheelchair?

08:19.541 --> 08:21.752
Holy crip, he's a crapple!

08:24.505 --> 08:29.426
Peter, our new secret weapon
is this very attractive paraplegic?

08:29.968 --> 08:33.096
Okay, Joe, you got me.
Rise and shine. Come on.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.309
-Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.
-You're a hoot, Peter.

-Play ball!
-Let's do it!

08:39.394 --> 08:42.606
I swear I didn't know. Maybe
they won't hit a lot of balls to him.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.316
JOE: I got shortstop.

all over my carpet.

-I tried everything to get the stain out.
-What about lemon juice?

-What about club soda?
-What about shutting the hell up?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.619
Isn't baseball great?

They say baseball's the national pastime.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.835
I can't taste salt.

Please don't hit it to Joe!

of handi-capable toys, you know...

of being physically challenged!

morning at 6:00 a.m.

21:39.842 --> 21:44.012
I guess being a hero isn't always
about saving lives and catching bad guys.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.765
It's also about just being there
for the people you love.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.809
OLD WOMAN: Help!
Someone just stole my purse!

21:48.892 --> 21:51.311
Who cares? I don't even know you.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.525
