starting fights.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.928
Negly!

12:35.971 --> 12:38.845
Well, I heard from Blue,
and she said...

12:38.888 --> 12:40.889
[screaming]

12:55.817 --> 12:57.907
Uh, hi.

12:57.951 --> 12:58.865
Willow, right?

12:58.908 --> 12:59.908
Why?

12:59.952 --> 13:00.996
I-I mean, hi.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.956
Uh, did you want me
to move?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.957
Why don't we start
with "Hi, I'm Buffy,"

13:05.000 --> 13:06.567
and then let's segue

13:06.610 --> 13:09.135
directly into me
asking you for a favor.

13:09.178 --> 13:10.528
It doesn't
involve moving,

13:10.572 --> 13:12.486
but it does involve hanging
out with me for a while.

13:12.529 --> 13:15.097
But aren't you hanging
out with Cordelia?

13:15.142 --> 13:16.273
I can't do both?

13:16.317 --> 13:18.187
Not legally.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.234
Look, I really want
to get by here.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.495
New school.

13:21.538 --> 13:23.889
And Cordelia's
been really nice...

13:23.932 --> 13:25.543
to me, anyway...

13:25.586 --> 13:27.457
but, um, I kind of have
this burning desire

13:27.501 --> 13:29.068
not to flunk
all my classes,

13:29.111 --> 13:30.940
and I heard a rumor that you
were the person to talk to

13:30.984 --> 13:32.375
if I wanted
to get caught up.

13:32.419 --> 13:33.942
Oh, I could totally
help you out.

13:33.986 --> 13:35.466
If you have
sixth period free,

13:35.509 --> 13:37.424
we could meet
in the library.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.209
Or not.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.081
Uh, we can meet
someplace quieter.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.735
Louder. Uh, that place just
kind of gives me the wiggins.

13:43.778 --> 13:46.042
Oh, it has that effect
on most kids.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.000
I love it, though.
It's a great collection,

13:48.043 --> 13:49.959
and the new librarian
is really cool.

13:50.003 --> 13:50.873
He's new?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.440
Yeah, he just started.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.485
He was a curator
at some British museum--

13:54.528 --> 13:56.573
or theBritish Museum.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.140
I'm not sure,
but he knows everything,

13:58.184 --> 13:59.447
and he brought all these
historical volumes

13:59.490 --> 14:00.927
and biographies,

14:00.970 --> 14:03.277
and am I the single
dullest person alive?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.495
Not at all.

14:04.538 --> 14:05.975
Hey, you guys busy?
Are we interrupting?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.716
We're interrupting.Hey.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.500
Hey.
Hey there.

14:09.543 --> 14:10.761
Buffy, this is Jesse
and that's Xander.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.807
XANDER: Oh, me and Buffy
go way back.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.678
Old friends, very close.

14:14.722 --> 14:16.202
Then there was that period
of estrangement,

14:16.245 --> 14:18.813
where I think we were
both growing as people,

14:18.857 --> 14:20.642
but now here we are,
like old times.

14:20.684 --> 14:21.686
I'm quite moved.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.688
Is it me,

14:24.732 --> 14:26.735
or are you turning
into a bibbling idiot?

14:26.778 --> 14:28.562
No, it's, uh, it's not you.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.436
Well, it's nice to meet
you guys, I think.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.047
Well, you know,
we wanted to welcome you,

14:34.090 --> 14:35.831
make you feel
at home--

14:35.875 --> 14:37.572
unless you have
a scary home.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.921
And to return this.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.662
The only thing
I can think

14:40.705 --> 14:42.663
is that you're building
a really little fence.

14:42.706 --> 14:44.491
Aha. No, um...

14:44.534 --> 14:46.450
a-actually,
it was for self-defense.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.278
Everyone has them in L.A.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.366
Pepper spray is just so passé.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.977
So what do you do for fun?
What do you like?

14:52.020 --> 14:54.110
What do you look for in
a man? Let's hear it.

14:54.153 --> 14:55.328
If you have any dark,

14:55.371 --> 14:57.070
painful secrets
you'd like us to publish?

14:57.113 --> 14:59.942
Gee, everyone wants
to know about me.

14:59.985 --> 15:00.942
How keen.

15:00.986 --> 15:02.162
Well, not much goes on

15:02.205 --> 15:04.380
in a one-Starbucks town
like Sunnydale.

15:04.424 --> 15:05.381
You're pretty big news.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.775
I'm not. Really.

15:07.818 --> 15:09.429
Are these guys
bothering you?

15:09.472 --> 15:11.258
Uh, no.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.346
She's not hanging out with us.

15:13.389 --> 15:14.347
Hey, Cordelia.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.957
Oh, please.

15:16.001 --> 15:17.437
I don't mean to interrupt
your downward mobility,

15:17.480 --> 15:18.961
but I just wanted to tell you

15:19.004 --> 15:20.962
that you won't be meeting
Coach Foster--

15:21.006 --> 15:22.399
the woman with the chest hair--

15:22.442 --> 15:23.966
because gym was canceled

15:24.009 --> 15:26.316
due to the extreme dead guy
in the locker.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.621
What?

15:27.664 --> 15:28.797
What are you
talking about?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.017
Some guy was stuffed
in Aura's locker.

15:31.059 --> 15:32.018
Dead?

15:32.061 --> 15:33.453
Totally dead.
Way dead.

15:33.496 --> 15:34.759
So, not just a little dead,
then?

15:34.802 --> 15:36.196
Don't you have
an elsewhere to be?

15:36.239 --> 15:38.153
You know, if you need
a shoulder to cry on

15:38.197 --> 15:39.938
or just to nibble on...

15:39.981 --> 15:41.244
How did he die?

15:41.288 --> 15:42.767
I don't know.

15:42.811 --> 15:43.812
Well, were there any marks?

15:43.855 --> 15:44.899
Morbid much?

15:44.943 --> 15:46.770
I didn't ask.

15:49.383 --> 15:53.299
Um, I got to book.
I'll-I'll see you guys later.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.607
What's her deal?

16:22.371 --> 16:24.984
Oh, great.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.856
Okay, what's the sitch?

16:28.899 --> 16:30.466
GILES:
Sorry?

16:30.510 --> 16:31.947
You heard about
the dead guy, right?

16:31.990 --> 16:33.687
The dead guy in the locker?

16:33.730 --> 16:34.994
Yes.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.038
'Cause it's the weirdest thing.

16:37.082 --> 16:39.999
He's got two little-little
holes in his neck

16:40.042 --> 16:41.956
and all his blood's
been drained.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.350
Isn't that bizarre?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.351
Aren't you just going,
"Ooh"?

16:45.394 --> 16:47.615
I was afraid of this.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.008
Well, I wasn't.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.096
It's my first day.

16:51.139 --> 16:54.013
I was afraid that I was gonna
be behind in all my classes,

16:54.056 --> 16:56.014
that I wouldn't make
any friends,

16:56.057 --> 16:58.451
that I would have
last month's hair.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.932
I didn't think there'd
be vampires on campus.

17:00.975 --> 17:02.107
And I don't care.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.717
Then why are you here?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.938
To tell you that...

17:06.981 --> 17:08.416
I don't care,

17:08.461 --> 17:09.941
which I don't,

17:09.983 --> 17:11.900
and have now told you,

17:11.942 --> 17:13.249
so...

17:13.291 --> 17:14.510
bye.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.991
Is he-- will he rise again?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.732
Who?

17:18.776 --> 17:19.777
The boy.

17:19.819 --> 17:20.865
No.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.692
He's just dead.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.652
Can you be sure?

17:24.694 --> 17:26.653
To make you a vampire,
they have to suck your blood,

17:26.695 --> 17:28.221
and then you have
to suck their blood.

17:28.262 --> 17:29.700
It's, like, a whole big
sucking thing.

17:29.743 --> 17:31.920
Mostly they're
just gonna kill you.

17:31.962 --> 17:33.964
Why am I still talking to you?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.010
You really have no idea
what's going on, do you?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.969
You think it's coincidence,
your being here?

17:38.012 --> 17:39.275
That boy was just the beginning.

17:39.318 --> 17:42.147
Why can't you people
just leave me alone?

17:42.191 --> 17:44.063
Because you are the slayer.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.977
To each generation
a slayer is born.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.892
One girl in all the world,

17:47.935 --> 17:48.980
a chosen one,

17:49.023 --> 17:50.590
one born with the strength...

17:50.634 --> 17:52.375
Strength and skill
to hunt the vampires,

17:52.419 --> 17:53.942
to stop the spread of
their evil blah, blah, blah.

17:53.984 --> 17:55.900
I've heard it, okay?

17:55.943 --> 17:57.815
I really don't understand
this attitude.

17:57.858 --> 17:59.164
You've accepted
your duty.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.775
You've slain vampires
before?

18:00.817 --> 18:02.384
Yeah, and I've both
been there and done that,

18:02.429 --> 18:03.517
and I'm moving on.

18:05.039 --> 18:08.086
What do you know
about this town?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.523
It's two hours on the freeway
from Neiman-Marcus.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.481
Dig a bit in the history
of this place,

18:12.526 --> 18:13.701
and you'll find
a-a steady stream

18:13.743 --> 18:15.049
of fairly odd
occurrences.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.311
I believe
this whole area

18:16.355 --> 18:17.835
is a center
of mystical energy,

18:17.878 --> 18:19.315
that things gravitate
towards it

18:19.358 --> 18:20.969
that-that you might
not find elsewhere.

18:21.011 --> 18:22.449
Like vampires.

18:22.491 --> 18:26.409
Like zombies, werewolves,
incubi, succubi--

18:26.452 --> 18:28.237
everything you've ever
dreaded was under your bed

18:28.280 --> 18:30.760
but told yourself couldn't
be by the light of day.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.894
They're all real.

18:32.936 --> 18:35.243
What, you, like, sent away
for the Time/Life series?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.333
Oh, w-well, yes.

18:37.376 --> 18:38.987
Did you get
the free phone?

18:39.029 --> 18:40.075
Um, the calendar.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.336
Cool.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.685
Wait. Okay.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.644
First of all,
I'm a vampire slayer.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.994
And secondly, I'm retired.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.171
Hey, I know.
Why don't you kill them?

18:49.214 --> 18:50.477
I'm a watcher.

18:50.519 --> 18:52.131
I-I haven't the skill.Oh, come on.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.958
Stake through the heart,
a little sunlight--

18:54.001 --> 18:55.742
it's like falling
off a log.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.528
A slayer slays,
a watcher...
Watches?

18:58.572 --> 18:59.789
Yes... no.

18:59.834 --> 19:04.055
He... he trains her.
He-he-he prepares her.

19:04.098 --> 19:05.448
Prepares me for what?

19:05.491 --> 19:07.450
For getting kicked out
of school?

19:07.493 --> 19:09.583
For losing all of my friends?

19:09.625 --> 19:12.628
For having to spend all of
my time fighting for my life

19:12.673 --> 19:15.371
and never getting to tell anyone
because I might endanger them?

19:15.414 --> 19:16.807
Go ahead.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.419
Prepare me.

19:26.773 --> 19:27.904
Damn.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.305
What?

19:36.348 --> 19:37.914
It's getting worse.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.742
What's getting worse?

19:40.961 --> 19:42.442
The influx
of the undead,

19:42.484 --> 19:43.964
the supernatural
occurrences.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.444
It's been building
for years.

19:45.488 --> 19:46.923
There's a reason
why you're here

19:46.968 --> 19:48.490
and a reason
why it's now.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.015
Because now is the time
my mom moved here.

19:51.058 --> 19:52.973
Something's coming.
Something-- something--

19:53.017 --> 19:54.845
something is--
is gonna happen here.

19:54.888 --> 19:55.977
Soon.

19:56.019 --> 19:58.458
Gee, can you vague
that up for me?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.547
The signs,
as far as I can tell,

20:00.589 --> 20:02.896
point to a crucial mystical
upheaval very soon.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.246
Days. Possibly less.

20:04.289 --> 20:05.377
Oh, come on.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.554
This is Sunnydale.

20:07.596 --> 20:09.817
How bad an evil
can there be here?

20:10.861 --> 20:12.863
[indistinct chatter]

20:40.978 --> 20:44.242
MAN:
The sleeper will wake.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.509
MAN:
The sleeper will wake.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.299
The sleeper will wake.

21:02.521 --> 21:04.740
The sleeper will wake,

21:04.785 --> 21:08.309
and the world will bleed.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.924
Amen!

21:22.324 --> 21:25.240
Hi, I'm an enormous slut.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.242
Hello, would you like
a copy of The Watchtower?

21:29.635 --> 21:31.550
I used to be so good at this.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.029
MOM:
Hi, hon.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.815
Hey.

21:34.857 --> 21:36.163
Are you going out tonight?

21:36.207 --> 21:37.512
Yeah, I'm going to a club.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.471
Oh.

21:38.513 --> 21:39.689
Will there be boys there?

21:39.732 --> 21:42.170
No, Mom, it's a nun club.

21:42.212 --> 21:44.259
Well, just be careful.

21:44.302 --> 21:45.433
I will.

21:48.088 --> 21:50.743
You know, I think we
can make it work here.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.355
I've got my positive
energy flowing.

21:53.398 --> 21:55.662
I'm gonna get the
gallery on its feet.

21:55.704 --> 21:58.055
Oh, uh, we may have
found a space today.

21:58.098 --> 22:00.230
That's great.

22:00.275 --> 22:03.017
Oh, and that school is a-a
very nurturing environment,

22:03.059 --> 22:04.278
which is just
what you need.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.498

This harvest thing is...

33:56.990 --> 33:59.471
I didn't find them.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.909
The vampire is not dead?

34:01.951 --> 34:03.779
No, but my social life
is on the critical list.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.304
So what do we do?

34:05.346 --> 34:06.869
I'll take care of it.

34:06.913 --> 34:08.829
I-I need to
come with you, yes?

34:08.871 --> 34:11.918
Don't worry. One vampire
I can handle.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.878
So, um, what did you
say your name was?

34:16.880 --> 34:18.664
Darla.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.231
Darla. You know, I haven't
seen you around before.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.972
Are you from around here?

34:22.016 --> 34:25.150
No, but I
have family here.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.326
Have I met them?

34:27.369 --> 34:29.371
You probably will.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.418
♪

35:09.628 --> 35:11.108
Master.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.639
I am weak.

35:19.681 --> 35:23.032
Come the harvest,
you will be restored.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.079
The harvest.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.733
We're almost there.

35:27.777 --> 35:30.128
Soon you'll be free.

35:41.356 --> 35:43.315
I must be ready.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.186
I need my strength.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.666
I've sent your servants
to bring you some food.

35:47.710 --> 35:48.797
Good.

35:48.842 --> 35:49.798
Luke...

35:49.842 --> 35:50.887
Yes?

35:50.931 --> 35:53.585
Bring me
something... young.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.242
Sure is dark.

35:57.284 --> 35:58.807
It's night.

35:58.851 --> 36:00.983
Well, that's
a dark time, night.

36:01.027 --> 36:02.811
Traditionally.

36:02.856 --> 36:05.206
I still can't believe I've
never seen you at school.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.382
Do you have Mr. Chomsky
for history?

36:09.775 --> 36:11.690
Uh, the ice cream bar
is this way.

36:11.733 --> 36:13.867
It's past
Hamilton street.

36:13.909 --> 36:15.695
I know a shortcut.

36:26.052 --> 36:28.054
[laughter
and indistinct chatter]

36:29.273 --> 36:30.753
Hey, you leaving already?

36:30.797 --> 36:32.668
Oh, Xander,
have you seen Willow?

36:32.711 --> 36:34.016
Not tonight, no.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.106
She left with a guy.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.152
We're talking about
Willow, right?

36:38.195 --> 36:40.153
Scoring at the Bronze.
Working it, girl...

36:40.197 --> 36:42.635
No, I need to find her.
Where would he take her?

36:42.677 --> 36:45.637
Why? Oh, hey, I hope
he's not a vampire,

36:45.681 --> 36:49.250
because then you might
have to slay him.

36:49.293 --> 36:52.427
Was there
a school bulletin?

36:52.471 --> 36:54.603
Was it in
the newspaper?

36:54.646 --> 36:57.693
Is there anyone in this town
who doesn't know I'm the slayer?

36:57.737 --> 36:59.956
No, I only know that you
thinkthat you're the slayer,

37:00.000 --> 37:01.914
and the reason
why I know that...

37:01.958 --> 37:03.394
Well, whatever.
It doesn't matter.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.266
Just tell me,
where would Willow go?

37:05.309 --> 37:06.614
You're serious.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.313
We don't find her,

37:08.356 --> 37:11.315
and there's going to be one
more dead body in the morning.

37:11.358 --> 37:15.233
O-Okay, this is nice...
and scary.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.105
Are you sure
this is faster?

37:18.148 --> 37:21.150
Hey, you ever been
in one of these?

37:21.195 --> 37:23.327
No. Thank you.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.201
Come on.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.728
What are you afraid of?

37:35.514 --> 37:36.514
[whimpers]

37:37.342 --> 37:39.518
[grunting]

37:42.737 --> 37:45.045
That wasn't funny.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.318
Uh, I think
I'm going to go.

37:58.362 --> 37:59.625
Is that what you think?

38:05.673 --> 38:07.849
DARLA:
Is this the best you could do?

38:07.893 --> 38:09.677
She's fresh.

38:09.722 --> 38:12.246
Hardly enough to share.

38:12.289 --> 38:15.597
Why didn't you
bring your own?

38:15.641 --> 38:16.902
I did.

38:16.945 --> 38:18.164
Hey,

38:18.208 --> 38:19.208
wait up.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.300
Oh, my God, Jesse.

38:28.827 --> 38:31.438
You know, I think
you gave me a hickey.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.487
I got hungry
on the way.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.791
Jesse, let's
get out of here.

38:36.835 --> 38:38.925
Oh, you're
not going anywhere.

38:40.447 --> 38:42.275
Leave us alone.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.061
You're not
going anywhere

38:45.105 --> 38:46.541
until we've fed.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.108
Aah!

38:48.150 --> 38:51.153
Well, this is nice.

38:51.197 --> 38:55.289
It's a little bare,
but a dash of paint,

38:55.333 --> 38:57.900
a few throw pillows,
call it home.

38:57.943 --> 38:59.858
Who the hell are you?

38:59.902 --> 39:01.121
You mean there's actually
someone in this town

39:01.164 --> 39:03.123
who doesn't know already?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.038
Phew, that's a relief.
I'm telling you--

39:05.081 --> 39:07.518
having a secret identity in
this town is a job of work.

39:07.561 --> 39:08.737
Buffy, we bail now, right?

39:08.780 --> 39:10.434
Not yet.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.523
BUFFY: Okay, first of all,
what's with the outfit?

39:12.567 --> 39:16.266
Live in the now, okay?
You look like DeBarge.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.967
Now, we can do this
the hard way or...

39:21.010 --> 39:23.838
well, actually, there's
just the hard way.

39:23.882 --> 39:25.536
That's fine with me.

39:25.579 --> 39:27.713
Are you sure? Now, this is
not going to be pretty.

39:27.755 --> 39:30.932
We're talking violence,
strong language, adult content.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.210
See what happens
when you roughhouse?

39:47.253 --> 39:48.646
He was young and stupid.

39:48.690 --> 39:49.996
Xander, go.

39:50.039 --> 39:51.083
DARLA:
Don't go far.

39:51.126 --> 39:52.998
[grunting]

40:04.532 --> 40:07.447
You know, I just
wanted to start over,

40:07.492 --> 40:09.014
be like everybody else.

40:09.057 --> 40:10.972
Have some friends,
you know, maybe a dog.

40:11.016 --> 40:13.498
But, no.
You had to come here.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.413
You couldn't go suck
on some other town.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.501
Who are you?

40:16.543 --> 40:18.764
Don't you know?
[gasps]

40:20.592 --> 40:22.724
I don't care.

40:22.768 --> 40:23.768
[grunts]

40:26.902 --> 40:29.949
You were supposed to be bringing
an offering for the master.

40:29.992 --> 40:32.994
We're almost at harvest,
and you dally with this child?

40:33.039 --> 40:35.737
We had someone,
but then she came.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.260
She killed Thomas.

40:37.304 --> 40:40.045
Luke, she's strong.

40:40.088 --> 40:43.918
You go. I'll see if I can
handle the little girl.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.931
You're strong.

40:59.804 --> 41:03.373
I'm stronger.

41:03.416 --> 41:04.809
We'll get the police.

41:04.853 --> 41:06.637
It's just
a few blocks up.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.291
[growling]

41:12.077 --> 41:13.992
LUKE:
You're wasting my time.

41:14.036 --> 41:16.648
Hey, I had other
plans, too, okay?

41:26.005 --> 41:27.746
You think
you can stop me?

41:27.789 --> 41:29.268
Stop us?

41:29.311 --> 41:31.967
[gasping]

41:33.228 --> 41:36.797
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

41:36.842 --> 41:37.972
Aah!

41:41.760 --> 41:44.371
And like a plague of boils,

41:44.414 --> 41:47.983
the race of man
covered the earth.

41:48.027 --> 41:50.856
But on the third day
of the newest light

41:50.898 --> 41:52.465
will come the harvest,

41:52.510 --> 41:57.036
when the blood of men
will flow as wine,

41:57.079 --> 42:01.083
when the master will walk
among them once more.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.432
The earth...

42:03.476 --> 42:06.523
will belong to the old ones.

42:08.438 --> 42:13.094
And hell itself
will come to town.

Aah!

Amen.

Grr. Argh.
