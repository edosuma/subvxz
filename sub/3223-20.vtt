00:03.461 --> 00:05.129
Supernatural by Carver Edlund.

00:05.296 --> 00:09.634
Everything is in here, I mean, everything.
From the racist truck to me having sex.

00:09.842 --> 00:11.802
- Moondoor.
- Wait, is that...?

00:11.969 --> 00:15.056
Defend the Queen of Moons.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.599
- I love you.
- I know.

00:16.807 --> 00:19.644
- What's the second trial?
- An innocent rescued from hell...

00:19.810 --> 00:21.812
- ...and delivered unto heaven.
- Aah!

00:22.021 --> 00:24.148
- Sam?
- It's done.

00:25.858 --> 00:28.736
Kevin Tran.
Thought you could elude me forever.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.405
- He's gone.
- The little geek made a run for it.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.686
What the hell?

01:56.949 --> 01:58.326
What the hell is this?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.719
"1951 "?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.485
Give me five minutes
with some clippers...

03:14.694 --> 03:15.986
Ah, shut up.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.489
Uh, what time did I lay down?

03:19.907 --> 03:22.993
You took a siesta around noon.
Yesterday.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.169
- I'm sorry. Uh...
- That's why we don't have nice things, Sam.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.550
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:37.758 --> 03:42.847
Just... Uh, you know what? I'm gonna
get dressed. We should go find Kevin.

03:43.055 --> 03:46.058
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, sleeping beauty.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.521
Look, man. I've hacked into every security
camera around Garth's houseboat...

03:50.688 --> 03:53.149
- ...Kevin's hometown, where Mrs. Tran lived.
- And?

03:53.899 --> 03:55.151
Well, nothing so far.

03:55.359 --> 03:57.737
- Dean, we have to find him.
- I know. I know.

03:57.945 --> 04:01.115
Garth is out looking for him.
We've got a hunter APB out on Kevin.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.868
We'll do what we can from here.
While you get better.

04:04.618 --> 04:06.120
I'm fine.

04:06.328 --> 04:09.707
- I can still go out there. I can still hunt.
- Really?

04:19.048 --> 04:21.051
This is stupid.

04:26.056 --> 04:29.727
All right. You hit that target, we'll
talk about you getting back out there.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.562
No problem.

04:44.408 --> 04:46.327
Look, the second trial hit you harder.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.079
I don't know whether
it was just more intense or what.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.501
It felt the same. Until the next day.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.629
So we're gonna sit tight...

04:57.087 --> 05:01.342
...keep an eye out until
you, uh, get better.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.730
It's from Charlie.

05:16.857 --> 05:20.194
"In the neighborhood,
found you guys a case." Found us a case?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.780
In the neighborhood?
How the hell does she know where we are?

05:22.947 --> 05:25.825
Uh, well, she doesn't.
Not exactly, at least.

05:26.033 --> 05:28.661
She tracked our cells,
then the signal went out.

05:29.703 --> 05:33.290
Huh. This place must be
in some kind of, like, Bermuda Triangle.

05:33.457 --> 05:35.626
Are you saying
we can make phone calls here...

05:35.793 --> 05:38.712
...and nobody can track us?
Man, I love this place.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.267
Your highness.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.727
What's up, bitches?

06:00.901 --> 06:02.862
You okay, Sam?

06:03.070 --> 06:04.446
Yeah. No, I'm good. Yeah.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.532
- What are you doing in Kansas?
- Uh...

06:07.366 --> 06:09.785
A comic convention, in Topeka. Heh.

06:10.911 --> 06:14.164
- In the middle of the week?
- Girl's gotta get her collectibles.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.252
So you gonna invite me
into your dungeon...

06:18.419 --> 06:20.880
...or do I gotta answer
your questions three first?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.967
Follow us. Let us introduce you
to the Men of Letters.

06:25.175 --> 06:26.886
Holy awesome.

06:27.094 --> 06:30.514
Too bad they got wiped out.
That is what they get for the sexist name.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.393
Well, anyway, that's our skinny.
How about you?

06:35.436 --> 06:36.854
Um...

06:37.062 --> 06:39.023
Made a deal with the Yesteryear weirdos.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.442
We're gonna team up
to stomp the Shadow Orcs.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.737
- You are still coming to the jubilee, right?
- Wouldn't miss it.

06:45.362 --> 06:47.573
So, what about this case you brought us?

06:47.781 --> 06:52.077
Oh. When I was in Topeka,
I saw this pop up over the wire.

06:52.912 --> 06:57.458
Tom Blake, a checkout clerk in Salina
who went missing on his way home from work.

06:57.666 --> 07:01.712
He was found dead yesterday.
His insides? Liquefied.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.589
Locals have no idea what happened.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.676
They tried to bury the report
so people wouldn't freak, but I flagged it.

07:07.885 --> 07:11.055
I've eliminated the following things
that go bump in the night.

07:11.221 --> 07:13.766
Wait a second.
When did you become such an expert?

07:13.933 --> 07:17.227
Well, after you guys left,
I dug into all things monstrous.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.774
I'm a wee bit obsessive.
If "a wee bit" means completely.

07:21.982 --> 07:25.235
I also found this series of books
by Carver Edlund.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.783
Did those books really happen?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.078
Wow.

07:34.286 --> 07:36.580
That is some meta-madness.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.624
Thanks for saving the world and stuff.

07:38.832 --> 07:41.627
- Sorry you have zero luck with the ladies.
- Wha...?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.464
We need to find every single copy
and burn them.

07:45.673 --> 07:49.385
- They're online now, so good luck with that.
- Awesome.

07:49.593 --> 07:52.137
Well, you two crazy kids deal with that.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.474
I will go see if there's anything
to this, uh, case of yours.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.935
- I'm coming with you.
- Whoa!

07:58.143 --> 07:59.436
Are you sure you're okay?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.938
- Yes.
- No.

08:01.146 --> 08:03.148
- You're taking a knee.
- I'll go with you.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.903
Look, no disrespect,
but there is a big difference...

08:08.070 --> 08:10.656
...between reading about hunting
and actually hunting.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.033
I'm coming with.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.704
- For serious?
- Okay.

08:16.870 --> 08:19.623
If you can hit that target,
then we can talk about you...

08:25.004 --> 08:26.964
What?

08:27.965 --> 08:30.467
All right, if you're gonna
do a ride-along, then, uh...

08:30.676 --> 08:33.136
...you gotta lose the novelty T-shirts.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.849
Son of a pantsuit.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.481
Mm, yeah

08:45.649 --> 08:51.822
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure

08:53.824 --> 09:00.497
And I just can't wait till the day
When you knock on my door

09:04.918 --> 09:06.086
Montage.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.763
Trials? That's never good.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.057
Yeah, and our prophet's in the wind.

09:18.265 --> 09:21.518
What about, uh, Castiel?
He seems helpful and dreamy.

09:21.685 --> 09:25.147
He's MIA, with a tablet of his own,
doing God knows what.

09:25.355 --> 09:28.275
I mean, to be honest,
this whole thing is...

09:28.525 --> 09:31.737
I mean, Sam's a tough son of a bitch,
but Cass is saying that these trials...

09:31.904 --> 09:35.324
...are messing with him in ways
that even he can't heal.

09:35.532 --> 09:38.952
If it's any consolation,
having read your history...

09:39.161 --> 09:42.331
...there is pretty much nothing the
Winchesters can't do if they work together.

09:42.998 --> 09:44.041
Thanks.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.921
Must be nice, having a brother,
someone to always watch your back. Heh.

09:49.088 --> 09:54.051
- Yeah. No brothers or sisters?
- Actually, I have two.

09:54.968 --> 09:57.763
Their names are Xbox and PS3.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.351
I'm not getting any reception.
Can I use your phone?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.228
Mm, sure.

10:09.691 --> 10:11.527
- Yeah?
- Hey. It's me. You okay?

10:11.693 --> 10:13.904
Yes, Dean, I'm still fine.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.906
- Look, I can hunt...
- Let the healing continue.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.783
I'll check in with you later.

10:28.919 --> 10:29.962
Close enough.

10:33.423 --> 10:35.217
Come in.

10:44.601 --> 10:47.896
Hi. Uh, Special Agent Hicks.
This is my partner, Agent Ripley.

10:48.063 --> 10:50.858
We're here about the body
with the creamy filling.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.359
Ah, right.

10:52.609 --> 10:57.156
- I didn't think you'd have any interest in that.
- FBI. We never leave a stone unturned.

10:57.364 --> 10:59.241
- Mind if we take a peek?
- Of course not.

10:59.449 --> 11:02.661
I just need your signed chain-of-custody
request and it's all yours.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.372
- Sorry, the what?
- Chain-of-custody request.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.708
From your supervisor to mine.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.628
Right. Uh, you know what?

11:12.379 --> 11:15.382
You want to call my supervisor?
He can give you the override.

11:16.341 --> 11:18.218
Sorry. Unless he can get me the form...

11:18.427 --> 11:22.723
- ...I can't give you access to the body.
- But FBI.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.561
I understand, dear,
but paperwork is paperwork.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.313
Of course.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.815
Jennifer. Uh, it is Jennifer?

11:31.982 --> 11:34.318
- Heh. Yeah.
- Yeah. Um...

11:34.526 --> 11:38.655
We have been on the road all day
and this is strictly routine...

11:38.822 --> 11:40.657
...dot the I, cross the T
kind of thing.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.787
If you could do us a solid...

11:52.169 --> 11:54.338
Come back with the signed form...

11:54.546 --> 11:57.007
...I'd be happy to do you a solid.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.092
Until then...

12:02.221 --> 12:05.390
- That never happened in the books.
- Want to tell me what happened back there?

12:05.599 --> 12:09.186
I'm sorry. I froze.
I couldn't control-alt-delete my way out.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.564
- Real-life role-playing is hard.
- It's okay.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.818
We'll come back later when, uh,
Doris Do Right isn't here anymore.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.113
- Oh, perfect. Breaking and entering.
- No different than hacking.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.367
Beg to differ. One I've been doing
since I was a teenager...

12:23.575 --> 12:26.745
...the other I've done once
with you two walking me through it...

12:26.954 --> 12:28.455
...and I had my arm broken.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.582
What did you hack
when you were a teenager?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.709
Uh, NORAD.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.755
Whatever you say, WarGames.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.716
Why don't we go grab some grub
while we wait?

12:45.764 --> 12:48.350
Awesome. I got three stars.

12:48.558 --> 12:53.021
So? I'm three levels ahead of you, man.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.027
- Dude, stop.
- I can't. I'm just too good.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.946
Dude!

13:14.418 --> 13:17.254
Whoa, no, dude. That's a bad idea.

13:17.462 --> 13:20.257
Your face is a bad idea.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.055
See? Nothing to worry about.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.207
Maybe you should go first this time.

13:54.374 --> 13:56.793
Uh-uh. Back on the horse, kiddo. Come on.

14:03.550 --> 14:06.219
Hey there. I am Special Agent Ripley.

14:06.386 --> 14:10.557
- This is my partner.
- Save it. Your other agent's over there.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.525
- What took you so long?
- What are you doing here?

14:20.692 --> 14:22.611
Working the case. Same as you.

14:22.819 --> 14:26.323
Jake Hill. Librarian. Went missing
yesterday, no relation to the other vic.

14:26.990 --> 14:29.534
Coroner already swooped in
and scooped up what was left of him.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.745
Yeah, we met her. Bit of a stickler.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.831
There's not a body, nothing to see,
so why don't you head home?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.585
Still haven't talked to the witnesses.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.671
We can handle that.
Charlie, go talk to the witnesses.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.257
- I don't wanna miss the bro-ment.
- Charlie.

14:47.844 --> 14:50.222
I know you're frustrated,
but you're also sick.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.141
- I'm not leaving, Dean.
- Hey, boys.

14:53.350 --> 14:57.979
Special Agent Ripley, FBI and stuff.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.524
- What game you guys playing?
- "Super Eater."

15:01.149 --> 15:03.485
"Underworld Adventures"
or "Dimension Travelers"?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.362
- "Underworld Adventures."
- Nice.

15:06.363 --> 15:11.034
So about that childhood trauma
you experienced earlier...

15:12.953 --> 15:15.247
I know you want to help.
I do, all right? But...

15:15.414 --> 15:18.458
Dean, you cannot take care
of the both of us.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.586
I need to be out here.
"Play through the pain," right?

15:21.795 --> 15:23.630
Come on, man. Don't quote me to me.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.675
So the boys said they noticed something
on the body's arm...

15:26.883 --> 15:29.344
...before it covered them
in years of future therapy.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.263
Said it looked like a blue handprint.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.516
Sounds like something you should
read about. In a book. At home.

15:34.724 --> 15:37.561
I'm not leaving until we find out
whatever's doing this.

15:38.603 --> 15:40.063
Whatever.

15:41.314 --> 15:44.484
- You guys fight like an old married couple.
- Charlie.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.238
Does this mean we don't have to break
into the coroner's office?

15:48.697 --> 15:50.073
That's a great idea.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.165
- Is he leaving? He's leaving.
- That's all right.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.668
- I stole your car. I know where he's going.
- Cool.

16:01.918 --> 16:04.087
Wait, you stole my car?

16:16.516 --> 16:17.726
What took you so long?

16:19.186 --> 16:22.481
I stopped for gas.
Shut up. The body's in here.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.444
What the hell?

16:29.446 --> 16:32.157
Charlie. Charlie.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.498
It's the coroner. I got this.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.102
Hello.

17:01.645 --> 17:05.357
Hey there. Front door was open.

17:06.650 --> 17:11.695
- Oh. Uh, what are you doing here?
- I, uh, came back...

17:11.905 --> 17:15.032
...to get a blank copy
of that form you asked for.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.703
The FBI doesn't have
chain-of-custody forms?

17:19.704 --> 17:23.791
The field office had a power outage
after catching fire.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.419
Figured I could just borrow
a copy or two.

17:26.586 --> 17:29.214
Ah. Of course. Just give me sec.

17:33.718 --> 17:35.595
What the hell?

17:36.721 --> 17:38.348
It's empty.

17:39.724 --> 17:40.767
Uh...

17:41.518 --> 17:43.270
- They burned the bodies.
- Already?

17:43.436 --> 17:46.523
They think it's some kind of
outbreak scenario.

17:46.731 --> 17:48.400
Even got the CDC to sign off on it.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.902
These folks run a tight ship.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.407
Okay. Here you go.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.869
Great. Perfect. Thank you.

18:00.203 --> 18:03.665
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do in the morgue.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.835
Uh, can I ask you a personal question?

18:08.044 --> 18:13.174
I am new to the whole power-suit thing,
and yours, heh, is killer.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.051
Where do you get them?

18:15.218 --> 18:18.138
This mean we need to take
Silkwood showers, or is this a case?

18:18.305 --> 18:20.599
Yeah, something about that mark
the kids saw rings a bell.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.728
Probably have to check the lore,
or maybe Dad's journal.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.814
Hurry up.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.817
You need three jackets,
three pairs of pants and you're set.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.320
So simple, so smart.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.615
- You should have a blog.
- Okay. I'll get right on that.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.415
Um, so, what about shoes?

18:45.624 --> 18:51.087
- I can never find the right kind to go with...
- Okay. I'm sorry, but I'm not a stylist. Heh.

18:57.135 --> 19:02.057
Uh, well, thanks for the forms
and the fashion advice.

19:02.265 --> 19:06.061
You're the best.
Don't go changing. Okay, bye.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.652
- Leviathan?
- Mm...

19:13.860 --> 19:15.987
They consume their prey.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.782
Well, maybe the vics were Leviathan.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.535
No black goo on either scene,
according to the reports.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.581
- Dragons. They, uh...
- No signs of burns on the vics.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.585
I hate that thing.

19:31.127 --> 19:34.506
- I want one.
- Wait a second. Djinn.

19:34.714 --> 19:36.549
Djinn vics don't get liquefied.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.887
No, no, no. Not regular Djinn. According
to this, there is a bastard offshoot.

19:41.262 --> 19:43.056
Uh, their eyes light up blue.

19:43.264 --> 19:45.475
They pass as humans,
all that regular jazz.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.103
Except these leave their victims
with jelly-like insides...

19:48.269 --> 19:50.855
...and supposedly,
when they poison their victims...

19:51.064 --> 19:53.983
...they leave behind a blue handprint.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.654
I hate that thing. And I want one.

19:57.862 --> 20:00.198
So do these things die like regular Djinn?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.534
Silver blade dipped in lamb's blood,
yeah.

20:02.742 --> 20:04.411
Now we just gotta find the asshat.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.832
All right. Well, breakthrough means
snack time to me.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.252
And I want to just, uh, stretch my legs.

20:12.460 --> 20:13.962
I will pick us up some grub...

20:14.170 --> 20:16.589
...and unlike you, Sam,
I will not forget the pie.

20:23.012 --> 20:26.224
- She seem a little off to you?
- Since the second she got here.

21:42.133 --> 21:45.345
Charlie, it's Sam. Uh...

21:45.553 --> 21:48.389
Again. Call us. Okay?

21:58.399 --> 21:59.442
Hey.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.280
- Any word from Charlie?
- Uh, no. Uh...

22:04.489 --> 22:07.033
And there was no comic convention
in Topeka.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.744
I don't know why...
I mean, why would she lie to us?

22:11.788 --> 22:13.540
One way to find out.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.500
What are you doing?

22:15.708 --> 22:18.628
When I called you from her phone,
I turned on her GPS.

22:20.004 --> 22:21.297
Charlie?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.800
Hey, Charlie, you in there?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.136
Dean.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.193
What the hell?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.407
What the hell is this place?

22:49.826 --> 22:52.537
Whatever it is, it belongs to Charlie.

22:52.745 --> 22:54.998
Or some variation of her.

22:55.206 --> 22:57.584
Who the hell is she, Jason Bourne?

22:58.293 --> 23:02.171
All right, we got no forced entry, so
either it was somebody that she knew or...

23:02.380 --> 23:03.840
Djinn.

23:04.757 --> 23:06.467
Here's all our missed calls.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.386
- You got anything on her laptop?
- Yeah.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.598
Uh, she's been making donations
through aliases...

23:11.764 --> 23:14.517
...to Shawnee County General
here in Topeka.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.645
- Like a charity?
- A patient. Gertrude Middleton.

23:18.813 --> 23:22.859
We need answers. Uh, I'll take Gertrude,
you keep Djinn-digging.

23:26.362 --> 23:29.616
Gertrude's been in a persistent
vegetative state for 16 years.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.951
About a year ago,
her condition got worse.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.330
This ventilator's the only thing
keeping her alive.

23:36.205 --> 23:37.248
How did this happen?

23:37.457 --> 23:40.209
She and her husband
were hit by a drunk driver.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.961
He didn't make it.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.505
They were on their way
to pick up their daughter.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.884
- Their daughter?
- She was 12.

23:48.092 --> 23:50.845
She got into trouble
after her parents' accident.

23:52.138 --> 23:54.432
Nobody's heard from her since.

23:55.224 --> 23:57.852
Folks have been donating
to cover her care over the years.

23:58.269 --> 24:02.565
It's a sweet gesture,
but the truth is, she's gone.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.360
- She ever get visitors?
- A couple nurses thought...

24:05.568 --> 24:09.447
...they saw someone in here reading to her,
but nobody's officially signed in.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.075
She's all alone.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.870
- If you'll excuse me, I have to make rounds.
- Thank you.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.720
You got one hell of a daughter,
Mrs. Middleton.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.265
I promise you I will find her.

24:39.602 --> 24:41.688
You're not going anywhere.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.231
Wilhelm scream.

24:49.696 --> 24:52.198
Do you know what I smell on you?

24:52.407 --> 24:57.662
- Deodorant? A little pee, maybe?
- Fear.

24:59.330 --> 25:03.710
- Djinn smell fear?
- Well, well, well.

25:03.918 --> 25:08.047
If you know about Djinn, then you and
your little friend are hunters, not FBI.

25:08.214 --> 25:10.925
No. I'm more hunter-in-training.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.635
Totally not worth killing.

25:12.802 --> 25:17.348
Heh. Oh, but you are worth killing,
sweetheart. Yeah.

25:17.557 --> 25:22.854
You see, my kind,
we prefer a more bitter taste to blood...

25:23.021 --> 25:25.231
...than the run-of-the-mill Djinn.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.275
We prefer the taste of fear.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.695
And when I got a whiff of you
at that morgue...

25:30.862 --> 25:36.367
...oh, such delicious fear inside of you.
I followed your scent.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.327
I knew you'd make a meal fit for two.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.414
For two?

25:42.457 --> 25:43.958
No.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.597
- So no chance of a recovery, huh?
- No.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.307
Gertrude seemed like a cool mom.

25:59.515 --> 26:02.560
Kind, strong,
taken from her family way too young.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.687
Remind you of anybody?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.690
- Did you find anything?
- I think so.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.817
Uh, a John Doe from nine years ago.

26:09.984 --> 26:12.612
The original coroner
wanted the body sent to the CDC...

26:12.779 --> 26:16.115
...but the coroner's assistant
"accidentally" ordered the body burned.

26:16.282 --> 26:18.326
- New assistant?
- Jennifer O'Brien.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.246
Coroner's a hell of a cover
for hiding kills.

26:25.041 --> 26:29.295
My manly man friend's gonna come get you,
you creepy power-suit lady.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.255
Oh, let him come.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.549
He reeked of fear as well.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.184
Look at this. CDC?
Never heard from Jennifer either.

26:43.351 --> 26:47.396
- She faked the reports, burned the bodies.
- Why'd she get sloppy after nine years...

26:47.563 --> 26:49.941
...start leaving bodies
where they could be found?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.443
Well, let's go ask her.
According to this...

26:52.652 --> 26:54.612
...she owns two pieces of property
in town...

26:54.779 --> 26:57.240
...one 2-bedroom house
about 10 minutes from here...

26:57.406 --> 27:01.202
- ...and an abandoned shipping warehouse.
- Of course she does.

27:27.770 --> 27:28.855
Charlie.

27:29.647 --> 27:33.025
Charlie. Hey. Hey, Charlie.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.231
You okay?

28:13.524 --> 28:14.567
Where's Charlie?

28:30.416 --> 28:33.461
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

28:34.462 --> 28:38.549
- Maybe she needs a different antidote.
- Charlie? She's burning up, man.

28:38.758 --> 28:41.344
- We're not letting her turn to Jell-O.
- Okay, okay. Uh...

28:42.261 --> 28:44.430
Djinn poison puts your brain into a loop...

28:44.639 --> 28:46.432
- ...while your blood boils, right?
- Right.

28:46.599 --> 28:50.019
Um, if the antidote didn't break the loop,
we find a way inside.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.939
Djinn take you to your happy place.
Like a dream.

28:53.147 --> 28:54.190
African dream root.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.417
All right, let's do this.

29:19.382 --> 29:22.093
Ah. Okay.

29:22.301 --> 29:25.554
All right, I'm gonna need to go
to sleep fast, so, uh, punch me.

29:27.139 --> 29:28.975
Look, I know you don't want to, okay?

29:30.184 --> 29:31.227
Oh!

29:31.852 --> 29:35.189
You're a little off your game there,
because that was, uh... That was pretty...

30:17.565 --> 30:18.941
Come with me if you want to live.

30:20.359 --> 30:22.653
I've always wanted to say that.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.989
What are you doing in my dream?

30:25.197 --> 30:28.367
You were attacked by a Djinn.
The coroner, Jennifer, remember?

30:28.576 --> 30:30.703
Djinn usually send you
to your happy place.

30:30.911 --> 30:33.956
No judgment, but you got a really strange
sense of happy.

30:34.123 --> 30:37.251
Wait, wait. No, no, no.
Jennifer said her kind feeds off fear.

30:38.544 --> 30:39.795
This isn't my happy place.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.505
This is a nightmare of mine.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.591
- What is this?
- It's a video game.

30:43.799 --> 30:47.803
- You're telling me this is a video game?
- It was called "The Red Scare."

30:48.012 --> 30:49.847
First-person shooter against vampires.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.308
I copied it before it was finished...

30:52.516 --> 30:55.019
...reprogrammed it to reflect
my liberal politics...

30:55.186 --> 30:57.229
...and then I released it for free.

30:57.688 --> 30:59.607
Then they tracked me down
and had me arrested.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.069
- I was 12.
- And you've been on the run ever since.

31:13.871 --> 31:15.373
- How do we get out?
- I don't know.

31:15.539 --> 31:18.417
We gave you the antidote, it didn't take.
I killed the Djinn.

31:18.584 --> 31:20.211
Both of them?

31:35.101 --> 31:36.352
You killed my mom.

31:46.445 --> 31:47.905
We gotta get back, help Sammy.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.408
Tell me about this game.
Maybe if we can win...

31:59.083 --> 32:02.795
I don't know how long I've been out, but
I've been through this level 1000 times.

32:03.003 --> 32:04.046
What?

32:04.255 --> 32:06.507
I beat the level, save the patients,
I get reset.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.428
Only there's less weapons
and the vampires are faster.

32:13.514 --> 32:14.974
It's an infinite loop.

32:15.182 --> 32:17.059
Like Pac-Man without level 256.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.645
- Level what?
- Nothing.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.772
Wait, what patients?

32:33.742 --> 32:34.785
Charlie?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.080
I know who this is.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.379
What are you talking about?

32:46.589 --> 32:49.258
When you went missing,
me and Sam found your little crash pad.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.429
We saw the payments
that you make for her.

32:54.054 --> 32:57.975
So I went and visited your mom,
looking for you.

33:01.687 --> 33:03.272
She's why I'm in Kansas.

33:07.776 --> 33:11.447
I sneak into the hospital whenever I can,
and I just...

33:12.865 --> 33:14.408
I read to her.

33:15.367 --> 33:19.121
She used to read me to sleep at night
when I was a kid.

33:22.082 --> 33:24.627
She'd read me The Hobbit.

33:28.422 --> 33:30.925
She's the reason I love the stuff I love.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.470
I'm sorry for your loss.

33:35.387 --> 33:37.223
She's not gone.

33:51.862 --> 33:53.739
Sam?

33:57.284 --> 33:58.827
Is this my nightmare or yours?

34:12.466 --> 34:14.510
So... Heh.

34:14.717 --> 34:18.138
It wasn't your mama who messed up.
It was you.

34:18.347 --> 34:21.350
- Shut up!
- Unh! Aah!

34:21.516 --> 34:23.185
I just came of age. I had to feed.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.353
I screwed up.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.356
Mom knew how to cover her tracks.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.942
She always told me
not to play with my food.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.195
Maybe you should have
listened to your mom.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.369
This is it, the boss battle.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.788
- We gotta save the patients.
- Wait, wait.

34:42.996 --> 34:47.208
You said that we're stuck in a loop, right?
But in the real world, you're dying.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.130
And I might be too.
We gotta find a way to break this loop.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.340
Okay. How?

34:55.050 --> 34:58.012
I think the only way to stop this
is to not play.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.723
What? No, no, we gotta save them.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.850
Nut up, Winchester.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.270
See? You can't stop either.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.440
This poison is designed
to put your mind into a cycle...

35:09.607 --> 35:13.152
...while your insides turn to mush, okay?
And its fuel is fear.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.113
Now, I think the only way
to break this cycle...

35:16.322 --> 35:19.158
- ...is to let go of the fear and stop playing.
- You don't know that.

35:20.659 --> 35:22.703
Your fear is creating all of this.

35:22.911 --> 35:25.372
But you're not afraid
of those vamps out there...

35:25.581 --> 35:28.292
...you're not afraid of this game,
of what it did to you.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.961
Hey. Look at me.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.256
You're afraid of losing her.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.968
- Charlie, she's already gone.
- No. You don't understand.

35:38.177 --> 35:44.141
You don't understand.
I was at a sleepover and I got scared...

35:45.351 --> 35:48.854
...so I called my parents
to come and get me.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.565
They should never have been
driving that night.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.651
It wasn't your fault.

35:53.859 --> 35:59.114
I just want to tell her that I'm sorry
and I love her...

35:59.323 --> 36:00.991
...and just have her hear it again.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.494
I just need her to hear that
one more time.

36:03.702 --> 36:07.831
- But she can't. She can't.
- I know.

36:08.999 --> 36:10.668
Believe me, I know.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.295
But you gotta let it go.

36:16.131 --> 36:17.549
Game over, kiddo.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.271
Mom?

37:13.772 --> 37:17.192
Dean. Dean. Hey, hey! Come here.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.737
You okay? What happened?

37:19.945 --> 37:21.905
- What happened?
- I'm okay.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.076
Charlie?

37:28.912 --> 37:30.247
I'm sorry.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.251
I had to.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.991
- So thanks for saving our bacon.
- Heh.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.452
Anytime, your highness.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.915
You know you're gonna be okay, right?

38:13.791 --> 38:18.378
Those books portray you as, like,
one tough customer.

38:19.838 --> 38:23.008
If anyone can get through the trials, Sam,
it's you.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.426
Thanks.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.346
You know, you really should come back
and dig through our archives.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.182
You are definitely a Woman of Letters.

38:31.850 --> 38:33.060
I like the sound of that.

38:43.695 --> 38:46.031
Well, thanks for stopping by, Charlie.

38:46.448 --> 38:48.075
Always wanted to get Tron'd.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.078
What's next for you?

38:53.664 --> 38:55.707
Gonna go by the hospital.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.212
Gotta let it go, right?

39:03.131 --> 39:05.133
What about you? You gonna let it go?

39:05.968 --> 39:07.511
Never.

39:09.012 --> 39:10.097
That's my boys.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.186
I love you.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.730
I know.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.968
Okay, look, you were right.
I should have laid low. I know.

39:48.135 --> 39:51.638
I should have hung back.
But I'm glad I was able...

40:00.147 --> 40:01.815
What do you say we find our prophet?

40:11.950 --> 40:14.828
Take all the time you need
with your mom, okay?

41:13.804 --> 41:16.139
One last time, okay?

41:23.981 --> 41:28.193
"In a hole in the ground,
there lived a hobbit.

41:28.902 --> 41:31.029
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole...

41:31.238 --> 41:35.283
...filled with the ends of worms
and an oozy smell...

41:35.951 --> 41:39.079
...nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole...

41:39.287 --> 41:43.500
...with nothing in it
to sit down on or to eat.

41:43.709 --> 41:47.379
It was a hobbit-hole,
and that means comfort."
