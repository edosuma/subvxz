00:14.932 --> 00:16.605
All right, gentlemen...

00:17.809 --> 00:20.187
Right here is
Black Rock Mountain, men.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.113
Fifteen to twenty minutes ago,

00:22.314 --> 00:26.319
Alpha Coy, became engaged
by 5O to 100 fighters,

00:26.527 --> 00:29.497
up, around, and on the vicinity
of Black Rock mountain.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.792
They're also taking some indirect
fires from this location.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.371
They hope to have them, uh,
backstopped by Bravo Coy

00:37.579 --> 00:39.707
and compress the enemy
between the two of 'em,

00:39.915 --> 00:42.509
setting the conditions
for us to come in

00:42.709 --> 00:43.881
and do our air assault.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.616
What's our
plan for this evening?

01:06.817 --> 01:09.295
Basically, we're rolling in with
the attack of the Command Element

01:09.319 --> 01:11.572
in order to secure
a, uh, high-traffic region

01:11.780 --> 01:13.407
for the, uh...
the Taliban.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.677
So you'll be with
Command Element in a Black Hawk

01:25.877 --> 01:27.689
and I'll be up with
the Joe's in a Chinook, yeah?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.841
Absolutely. Yeah, you get
the better spot, though.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.194
Beck Becks. I actually
have an L-10-11 going out.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.450
Upper foresight is good.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.450
Internals are incomplete.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.456
30 mag, all cooling.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.580
- You can go ahead, over.
- Roger, work it off.

02:06.835 --> 02:11.341
Arrow 2-5, I have
contact on all friendlies.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.176
We have good situational awareness.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.660
Arrow's clear.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.659
- Plug it in.
- Yep, Roger.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.214
Truckade...
her movement's the tree line.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.440
- Got anybody in there?
- I'm looking, sir.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.025
Right there,
clock him, hold on a second.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.634
Oh, shit, right.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.621
Arrow 2-5, we
have multiple enemies

03:16.822 --> 03:18.699
in trees, engaging west of road.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.497
Ah, we're getting shot at.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.426
- Roger...
- Oh, shit, their in...

03:29.626 --> 03:32.505
That's affirmative.
We are taking fire

03:32.713 --> 03:34.556
from the west side...

03:34.756 --> 03:36.884
And, Hard Rock, this is Arrow,

03:37.092 --> 03:39.345
we need permission
to engage the tree line,

03:39.553 --> 03:40.975
where the RPG came from.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.687
Roger, you're clear to engage.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.769
Uh, fucking
light that tree line up, hit it.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.696
Roger.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.648
- Just to the left. Hit it.
- Roger.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.494
Okay, make
sure that-Okay, looking good.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.663
- Oh, shit.
- Hit it, hit it.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.424
- RPG right over there.
- Right, hit it!

04:00.532 --> 04:03.251
We have multiple
RPGs coming from that side

04:03.452 --> 04:05.329
at the aircraft, I copy.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.182
Right, hit it.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.851
Hit it again.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.929
Hit it again.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.145
Good man, good man.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.572
We neutralized the one RPG site.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.946
Roger, that's good, copy.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.323
- Come up the road.
- Up the road, Roger.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.213
Up the road, up the road
to the left... to the left.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.174
- Right there in that building.
- Arrow 2-5, are you seeing

04:41.198 --> 04:42.745
- or we're taking more contact?
- Okay.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.576
Roger, we're engaged.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.958
Oh my god, I got a bucket.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.756
Oh, shit...

04:51.124 --> 04:52.546
On, shit.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.657
2-5, 2-5, one
of our vehicles got hit.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.584
We lost the line of...

05:32.749 --> 05:34.547
Standby, we're
missing friendlies.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.191
We're trying to
get him out of there.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.783
There was a huge,
huge air assault operation.

06:02.946 --> 06:06.075
This was involving
the first and 5-0-8,

06:06.283 --> 06:08.752
the parachute infantry
regiment, an entire regiment.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.705
It was involving
7th Special Forces Group,

06:11.913 --> 06:14.291
more than 15
different air assets.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.672
It was a huge operation,

06:16.877 --> 06:19.317
and it was going to be going on
for weeks and weeks and weeks,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.848
and within that first hour,

06:22.048 --> 06:23.528
one of the Chinooks
had been shot down

06:23.717 --> 06:25.435
by a Taliban
Surface-to-Air missile.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.106
They had to try
to secure this huge,

06:29.306 --> 06:30.808
flaming crash site,

06:30.974 --> 06:32.894
and they didn't know
if there were any survivors.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.316
What happened
when you touched down?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.488
We had heard that
there had been a Chinook

06:37.689 --> 06:39.169
that was shot down,
but I just focused

06:39.316 --> 06:41.489
on my job of shooting video

06:41.651 --> 06:43.449
and trying to get the story.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.845
1-3-6, over.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.607
Air Humvee.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.549
Roger, we heard there was a downed
aircraft. Can we confirm that?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.719
Is anybody looking
to our North route?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.409
I'd linked up
with the Commander,

08:12.575 --> 08:14.077
Lieutenant Colonel Brian Menace.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.962
And we were moving
to clear a compound

08:16.162 --> 08:17.664
so he'd have a secure location

08:17.872 --> 08:20.842
because they needed
to control 15 aircraft

08:21.042 --> 08:23.010
that were racked
and stacked in the sky.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.852
This had now become a combat
search-and-rescue mission

08:31.052 --> 08:33.100
in addition to the ongoing
offensive operation.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.571
Spread out.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.667
- Moo.
- I need to get by you.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.297
Do you speak English?

09:03.501 --> 09:04.798
Hey, he does.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.979
Hey, get him over here now.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.738
Get him over here now.
Get him out here.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.413
Come on.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.671
Let me see it.
Here, all right.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.048
Yeah, these guys check out.
They're friendlies.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.640
Thank you.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.346
Who the fuck is our...

10:22.205 --> 10:24.100
- All right, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.164
Which contact...

10:25.250 --> 10:27.228
- That one right there.
- Okay.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.051
Up, up, right there.
Hit it.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.556
Roger.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.477
Take that, fucker.
Here we go.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.180
- Coming up left.
- Roger.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.061
We nailed the shit
out of that one.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.987
<i>[Quadel Hey, limbo,
what are we hearing?</i>

11:01.077 --> 11:02.579
Thank you.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.217
I think what's
important to remember

11:08.418 --> 11:10.386
with this huge
operation is that...

11:10.587 --> 11:12.385
and it was an operation
that still went on

11:12.589 --> 11:13.886
for weeks and weeks thereafter.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.809
And there were many
battles that still followed

11:17.010 --> 11:20.765
and towns that these troops
had to clear, and...

11:22.140 --> 11:24.814
but the important thing that...
that can't get lost in this

11:25.018 --> 11:26.986
is that seven souls were lost.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.656
The five crew of the flipper

11:29.856 --> 11:31.654
and our coalition partners,

11:31.858 --> 11:34.077
a Brit and a Canadian...

11:34.277 --> 11:36.780
and that it... it
made no difference

11:36.988 --> 11:39.912
that... that it
was internationals

11:40.116 --> 11:41.743
or that they
might be reporters...

11:41.951 --> 11:44.545
that we had Americans that
were willing to risk their lives

11:44.746 --> 11:47.295
and go after and make sure
to recover the fallen.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.644
They had to count
the bodies of the fallen.

12:07.810 --> 12:12.111
And when I tracked down
Sergeant Greg Strickland,

12:12.315 --> 12:14.363
whose little six-man platoon...

12:14.567 --> 12:16.740
he had gone in there
and had counted five bodies.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.198
And he thought, okay,
well, I found the crew.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.749
And he was ordered
over the radio

12:21.950 --> 12:23.577
to go back in and
count the bodies again

12:23.785 --> 12:25.503
because the reporters
are missing.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.627
And he told me on camera
that he went back in there

12:28.831 --> 12:30.583
to look for the reporters,

12:30.792 --> 12:33.090
and he said he...
that... to look for me.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.054
I didn't know I was
supposed to be on that...

12:35.171 --> 12:37.048
on that helicopter,
on that Chinook.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.555
It was the guys
who told me afterwards.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.178
It was a punch to the gut

12:42.345 --> 12:45.724
because it was
this realization that...

12:48.309 --> 12:52.155
men put their lives at risk
to come after reporters,

12:52.355 --> 12:54.153
to come after people like me,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.405
even though I'm
not a service member.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.036
It's not that I have a purpose,

12:59.195 --> 13:01.869
but it's that I have
this huge responsibility.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.996
I have a debt to
pay back to these guys.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.543
I have to tell their stories.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.213
Did you stay embedded
with this group

13:09.414 --> 13:11.667
for the entirety
of their mission?

13:11.874 --> 13:16.004
No, I... I was with them
for a good week or so

13:16.212 --> 13:18.214
and then it was time
for me to dis-embed.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.260
I was trying to get in with the
Special Forces Teams in Iraq

13:21.467 --> 13:24.266
and I had a hit date
to try to get in there.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.349
And so it was time for me
to hitchhike my way to Iraq.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.194
I went to Diyala province,

13:35.398 --> 13:37.617
which is the size
of Massachusetts

13:37.817 --> 13:39.410
along the Iranian border,

13:39.569 --> 13:41.169
because that's where
I was going to embed

13:41.362 --> 13:44.366
with the Operational
Detachment Alpha 0-7-2.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.041
0.D.A 0-7-2 was
a so-called rough team...

13:49.245 --> 13:52.419
very austere, out there
on the fringe of the empire...

13:52.623 --> 13:55.752
where every day was truly
a fight for survival.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.761
Even their Special
Forces Commander

13:57.962 --> 14:00.181
called these twelve men
hard-charging

14:00.381 --> 14:02.509
and living the Special
Forces Dream...

14:03.593 --> 14:05.937
but they'd just lost
one of their own,

14:06.095 --> 14:09.645
Rob Pirelli, who I knew
from an earlier SF mission.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.106
Tell me... um...
tell me about Rob.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.071
Rob was the
senior engineer on our team.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.619
He... - Which means what?
What does an engineer do?

14:21.819 --> 14:24.117
Well, the engineer
is responsible for

14:24.322 --> 14:28.202
anything that
we have to build or destroy,

14:28.409 --> 14:32.630
or... he's responsible for
movement of all our equipment,

14:32.789 --> 14:34.291
accountability for
all our equipment.

14:34.499 --> 14:39.676
Um, basically he's the
logistics expert on the team.

14:39.879 --> 14:45.227
So an engineer... - So building
stuff and also, like, blowing stuff up?

14:45.426 --> 14:48.350
- Yeah.
- Okay, so, but building stuff too

14:48.554 --> 14:50.032
because I think a lot
of folks don't understand

14:50.056 --> 14:51.936
- that you guys do all sorts of things.
- Right.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.435
When we moved into this outpost,

14:53.643 --> 14:55.611
it was a house,
basically in desert,

14:55.812 --> 14:57.814
surrounded by barbed-wire fence.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.575
Within a month,
Rob had built the camp.

15:18.835 --> 15:23.215
♪ This ain't no world
for the weary eyed

15:23.423 --> 15:28.020
♪ This ain't no game
for the foolish child

15:28.219 --> 15:30.187
♪ This ain't no place

15:30.346 --> 15:32.599
♪ Got to fall in line

15:32.807 --> 15:37.938
♪ Gone away... - He did everything
from install the protective barriers

15:38.146 --> 15:40.319
to running electricity
for the house,

15:40.523 --> 15:42.400
repairing generators.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.074
He was literally working
until he went to bed.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.956
He'd wake up in the middle of the
night to play some online poker,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.379
go back to sleep,
wake up in the morning,

15:54.579 --> 15:55.899
still in his AC-ers
and his boots,

15:55.997 --> 15:58.216
ready to work in the morning
with a smile on his face.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.465
We thought it appropriate
to name the camp after him

16:01.669 --> 16:04.218
since he did so much
of that work on his own.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.584
We've been kinda holding
off on this one a little bit,

16:23.608 --> 16:26.782
but let's talk about
Rob and about that day.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.286
Yeah, it's a difficult
subject to talk about,

16:30.490 --> 16:33.494
but any questions you want
answered, you want to...

16:33.701 --> 16:36.250
find out about it, I'm more
than happy to talk about it.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.877
Bring us-— Let's
walk through that day.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.007
We drove out there,

16:48.216 --> 16:50.184
in an area
we've never been before.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.433
There was the makings
of a small village

16:53.638 --> 16:55.231
and so we stopped.

16:59.769 --> 17:03.865
My gunner, he had told me that he
saw somebody on top of the roof,

17:04.065 --> 17:05.907
somebody who was
wearing all black.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.545
And he had an AK, and he was
running around on top of the roof.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.696
The compound
directly to your North,

17:10.905 --> 17:13.454
we have one individual
up on the roof.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.376
And he had seen people

17:15.576 --> 17:17.453
maneuvering towards
his building,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.756
and he was sporadically
firing his weapon

17:19.955 --> 17:21.173
from off the top of the roof.

17:27.338 --> 17:31.935
And they started moving aerial
assets over to our location.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.937
My team Sergeant,

17:39.141 --> 17:41.815
he said "I've been shot,"
you know "Man down, eagle down."

17:42.019 --> 17:43.896
Eagle down!

17:46.148 --> 17:48.697
I directed my medic

17:48.901 --> 17:51.950
to maneuver up to the building
where we thought that he was.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.512
And I looked over to my right

17:54.699 --> 17:58.545
and I saw my Senior Charlie
at the time, Rob.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.291
He was laying on his back.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.266
I just remember reaching
around the corner

18:07.336 --> 18:09.680
and grabbing the strap
on his kit,

18:09.839 --> 18:13.139
and pulling him around
the corner of the building.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.638
It was crazy
because he looked...

18:16.846 --> 18:18.689
other than the fact
that he was unconscious,

18:18.848 --> 18:21.351
he looked like
nothing was wrong with him.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.902
And then I looked on his helmet,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.576
and there was a... uh, an
entry mark on the helmet

18:30.776 --> 18:33.074
basically the round
and pierced his helmet.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.078
The individual who
shot at Rob and Don,

18:36.282 --> 18:37.482
he was the battalion commander

18:37.617 --> 18:40.086
for all of Al-Qaeda
in that area.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.913
So I pulled back the Iraqis

18:42.121 --> 18:43.589
and we used an F16

18:43.789 --> 18:46.042
to do a couple runs
on this objective.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.734
- When you heard, what, uh...
- I was devastated.

19:03.893 --> 19:08.069
Um, yeah, you know,
it hits deep your heart.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.029
I've been able to, uh...
to work pretty closely

19:11.233 --> 19:13.201
with Rob's family,

19:13.402 --> 19:17.407
and I'm gonna, uh,
build, you know...

19:17.573 --> 19:21.123
with the loss of Rob,
be able to build together

19:21.327 --> 19:23.500
and help each other, you know.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.627
They feel a great
loss for their son,

19:25.831 --> 19:29.301
and my wife and I, we feel a
great loss for... for a friend.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.866
The next big mission
that happened

19:52.066 --> 19:54.615
after Staff Sergeant
Rob Pirelli was killed

19:54.819 --> 19:58.619
was a mission slated
for 9/11 time frame.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.542
The men that I was with
were going out

20:01.742 --> 20:03.870
and raiding houses

20:04.078 --> 20:06.547
and going after targets
and going after targets

20:06.747 --> 20:07.907
and going after more targets.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.467
- It's a big one, huh?
- That's gonna be a big one.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.591
It's gonna be a lot of assets.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.675
It's gonna be going on two-—
from 2300 to 1400 the next day.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.510
It's gonna be
a lot of stuff going on.

20:19.719 --> 20:23.223
- A lot of bad guys out there?
- Hopefully.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.808
Maybe not after we're done.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.569
We've got
approximately 24 total vehicles

20:36.777 --> 20:38.825
- going to get this objective.
- Okay, Roger.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.841
There were multiple
ODAs on this mission,

20:40.865 --> 20:42.833
and I was to be a
part of Assault Force 4

20:42.992 --> 20:45.120
in ODA 0-9-4s vehicle.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.134
The men of 0-9-4
were serious gunners

20:56.338 --> 20:58.557
and their motto was "machs gut,"

20:58.758 --> 21:00.635
a saying from a German
sniper in World War ♪

21:00.843 --> 21:03.096
Meaning "make it right."

21:05.681 --> 21:07.558
And that's what 0-9-4
was all about,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.394
getting it done.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.696
At this time, I'm located

21:11.854 --> 21:15.575
just to the east of that mosque
we were talking about, over.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.618
Okay, Roger, at this time,

21:17.818 --> 21:21.698
we're gonna start systematically
clearing this objective.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.625
Move! Move!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.702
Go, go, go, get in there.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.918
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- That's it!

21:30.122 --> 21:31.874
Watch your six.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.419
- Hey, that's it!
- Sir, we got two.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.627
Let's get out of here.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.635
It's more like the one
guy we wanted too.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.865
There were insurgents
that had squirted out

21:46.889 --> 21:49.733
from some of these targets and they
were hunkering in a palm grove.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.690
The aircraft overhead
thought that

21:51.894 --> 21:53.771
they were digging up
weapons caches

21:53.979 --> 21:55.356
and things like that.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.737
The next morning,
the Green Beret's called in

21:57.942 --> 21:59.444
and used air strikes.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.296
Is that cache
right around the area

22:01.320 --> 22:03.573
where they were low-calling
and shit too, you think?

22:03.781 --> 22:06.250
Yeah, there's six of them now.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.705
Six?

22:11.247 --> 22:12.840
Yeah.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.798
And he met up with his buddies.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.137
There he is.
You spot him?

22:28.848 --> 22:32.102
Okay, Roger, did your call
at 4 to 10 seconds now.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.815
He's got it cleared hot.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.113
Agent 3-3 Bubba 0-4.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.658
I have visual on four
at this time... men target, over.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.620
Fuck yeah!

22:47.908 --> 22:50.752
4-1-1 Bubba 0-4,
good hits and...

23:00.504 --> 23:01.972
- Yeah!
- You ready?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.830
It was like a
modern day cavalry charge

23:16.854 --> 23:18.731
through this
dried-out lake bed

23:18.939 --> 23:20.486
in these deep waddies.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.322
We've got still
two up ahead on the left.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.202
What is that?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.016
- They're up. Pick up the speed.
- We got it, Chief.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.667
Did you see where he came from?

23:37.833 --> 23:40.006
Negative! I did not see where
he came from directly.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.921
I just know from the left side.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.518
We got two up ahead,
two on the left.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.391
We got scouts
who can fucking shoot.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.393
Shoot! Shoot the...

23:51.597 --> 23:54.037
There was a
moment where we were under fire

23:54.224 --> 23:55.817
where I had to make a decision.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.988
Do I stay a journalist
or do I cross the line?

23:59.188 --> 24:03.739
Because the gunner, Bubba,
up above me with the 50 cal.,

24:03.943 --> 24:05.365
he was out of ammo.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.873
- What?
- Get the 50 cal.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.706
I took a breath and said, Okay, Chad,
you know, throw me your knife.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.145
I'll open
the strap on the ammo can.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.716
I'll put the camera down

24:23.921 --> 24:25.673
because there was nobody else.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.432
I don't think in that moment
it made me a combatant.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.607
I don't think I necessarily crossed
the line Journalistically.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.775
Had you thought through
that moment before?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.870
Or was it one of those things
that you just said,

24:38.894 --> 24:40.817
if it comes,
it comes and I'll...

24:41.021 --> 24:44.150
There becomes a moment when you might
have to check your moral compass

24:44.358 --> 24:46.907
and your gut, and figure out
what's the right thing to do.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.414
And in my career,
there's been moments where...

24:50.614 --> 24:53.242
is it the reporter thing
or is it the human thing?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.043
And I think in times like that,

24:55.244 --> 24:56.917
the human thing
needs to win out.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.938
How old are you?

25:15.097 --> 25:16.657
There were four of 'em
that we did catch

25:16.682 --> 25:19.060
and we conducted some tests

25:19.268 --> 25:21.987
to determine whether or not
they were actually the culprits,

25:22.187 --> 25:23.609
they guys that had fired at us.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.191
After the test results
came back,

25:25.399 --> 25:28.619
we knew that they were
the four guys that we wanted.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.448
Positive, positive,
positive, positive.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.875
So would they be considered
snipers or pretty good shots?

25:42.082 --> 25:43.834
I know one of them
got the truck.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.795
They had a sniper out there

25:46.003 --> 25:48.051
and they...
we did receive fire,

25:48.255 --> 25:50.178
a few, uh, rounds

25:50.382 --> 25:52.462
flew over our head and other
vehicle that you were in

25:52.551 --> 25:54.974
got shot up and a round actually
pierced the armor there.

26:04.063 --> 26:08.034
During that mission, there had
been a lull in the firefight

26:08.233 --> 26:10.361
after the feeding
of the ammo and all of that.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.788
I had asked if I could
get out of the vehicle

26:12.988 --> 26:14.786
and crawl up
on top of the vehicle

26:14.990 --> 26:18.164
to get some... some
panoramic shots,

26:18.368 --> 26:20.496
some wide shots
outside of the vehicle.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.174
And while I was up there,
stuff started happening again.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.132
So I jumped off
the roof of the vehicle...

26:27.336 --> 26:29.054
had a very hard landing,

26:29.254 --> 26:31.382
uh, busted my ankle
and busted my wrist.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.680
Something was wrong.
I knew that I had hurt myself

26:33.884 --> 26:36.182
and hurt myself badly, but...

26:36.345 --> 26:38.439
I tried to fake that I was fine.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.607
I didn't want to get sent home.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.607
I wanted to keep
getting the story.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.906
And so I kept faking...
trying to fake that I was fine.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.232
It got to the point where

26:48.440 --> 26:50.363
I couldn't go
on air assaults anymore.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.740
I couldn't even
put weight on the foot.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.539
And, uh, so it was
time for me to go home.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.613
Operational Detachment
Alpha 0-7-2,

27:27.813 --> 27:29.406
they did their team photo

27:29.606 --> 27:31.950
standing in front of
the Pirelli wall.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.949
And it was that team photo

27:34.153 --> 27:36.747
I brought to Rob's dad,

27:36.905 --> 27:38.498
Bob Pirelli.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.328
Above you are three C-1-30s,

27:43.537 --> 27:46.165
approaching the drop zone
with over 174

27:46.373 --> 27:49.001
lethal and highly motivated
paratroopers on board.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.586
The aircraft are flying in.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.004
Oh! IGOR, guys.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.431
He said how much
you built the place up.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.184
Well, when you heard about
this, what did you think?

27:57.384 --> 27:59.603
Well, when I heard about it,

27:59.803 --> 28:01.931
I thought it was nice.
I mean, I said, you know...

28:02.097 --> 28:05.601
but when I actually saw it,
physically saw the design

28:05.767 --> 28:07.078
they had... they had...
they had done,

28:07.102 --> 28:11.858
and I really get the sense
they... they really did, uh,

28:12.065 --> 28:14.568
officially name the outpost
with his name.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.906
And to see the actual drawing
on the side of the wall...

28:19.114 --> 28:21.082
And also, I think,
not only that,

28:21.283 --> 28:23.160
I think seeing it
on a soldier's arm...

28:23.368 --> 28:26.167
One of the soldiers
had the insignia done.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.918
- And, um...
- Tattooed?

28:28.123 --> 28:29.809
- Tattooed to his arm.
- Tattooed to his arm.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.632
That type of love
for each other,

28:32.794 --> 28:36.469
we need them
because they're him.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.134
You know, they're part of him.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.812
You know, them being around
makes a big difference to us.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.166
Well, this is the
basement and this is Rob's room.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.809
And that's what I call it,
Rob's room,

29:11.833 --> 29:14.177
because I turned around
and I decorated for Rob

29:14.378 --> 29:15.800
and all his things.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.348
It's a memorial for Rob.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.145
This here is a picture
of Rob's unit,

29:24.346 --> 29:26.098
one of them anyways.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.729
I remember him
calling me one time

29:28.934 --> 29:31.187
because I work in constructions

29:31.395 --> 29:33.147
and electrical construction.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.355
And he called me one time

29:34.481 --> 29:36.950
to ask me how to
wire something out there.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.572
And they wire differently...

29:38.777 --> 29:41.137
Their schematics are different
than our schematics, anyways.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.533
So even if I told him
that green was ground,

29:43.740 --> 29:45.913
he says, "The wires
over here are orange.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.540
What do I do?" You know.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.847
So he figured out... He figured
everything out himself, so yeah.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.044
And they all turn around
and they say that,

29:52.249 --> 29:54.217
the Pirelli outpost,
Rob built most of it

29:54.376 --> 29:56.299
and I'm sure he did.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.556
Rob loved hockey.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.930
Can you tell by the cups and all
that he loved the Avalanches?

30:03.135 --> 30:06.230
And these are some
of the players that he liked.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.436
We buried him
with his hockey stick

30:08.640 --> 30:10.608
and we buried him
with his number 18,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.483
his Hockey shirt from Franklin.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.066
And that went with him.

30:20.944 --> 30:24.414
My dad always said,
to really get to know Rob

30:24.573 --> 30:26.246
you needed to go
to the places he went,

30:26.450 --> 30:28.578
experience what he loved

30:28.785 --> 30:30.583
and see the things he built.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.919
'Hey.
'Hey! Buddy good to see you

30:33.081 --> 30:34.521
- You too, Shawn.
- How's everything?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.388
- Uh, it's going, it's going.
- Good, good.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.985
- How you doing?
- Good, good, good.

30:38.045 --> 30:39.262
Since Sunday, we've...

30:39.463 --> 30:41.682
You guys went to state, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.226
- That was awesome. Overtime?
- Yeah, double overtime.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.349
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, it was a great game.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.055
I can imagine.
That's the first time.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.856
Yeah, in 33 years.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.314
He came from a hockey town.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.815
He came from a hockey family.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.397
For dad, he was proud of Rob.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.448
You heard that
when he announced the games.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.366
He started announcing
because of Rob.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.195
You got 6 seconds
left, 41.6 seconds left

31:03.403 --> 31:05.781
in the second period.
One-one deadlocked,

31:05.947 --> 31:07.449
a great game.

31:07.616 --> 31:11.211
You're treated to one of the
best games of the year, here.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.290
And every time that Rob
touched the puck,

31:14.456 --> 31:18.006
it was... you hear him yelling,
like, "Pirelli's got the puck!

31:18.210 --> 31:20.258
Pirelli! Pirelli's got it!
He's gonna score!"

31:20.462 --> 31:23.215
It was... it was... you know,
everybody else was like,

31:23.423 --> 31:25.892
"Here comes Speducio,
Speducio shoots, shoots, save,"

31:26.093 --> 31:27.640
but when Rob touched the puck,

31:27.803 --> 31:30.352
it was... you felt it,
you felt his passion.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.933
Back up to Pirelli,
Pirelli on the left side.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.619
Pirelli fighting for
the puck on Speducio.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.941
He's looking down
the wrong way and...

31:38.855 --> 31:40.402
He's gonna have a break-away!

31:40.607 --> 31:42.405
Will it hit? Oh, no!

31:42.609 --> 31:45.328
Aww, on an open net.
He missed an open net.

31:45.487 --> 31:49.287
He made a beautiful move
and he misses the net.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.993
He wants Rob to score so badly

31:51.159 --> 31:52.581
because he wants
to announce this.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.208
He wants to announce
to the world

31:54.413 --> 31:56.211
that, like, Rob just scored.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.167
Everything...

31:58.375 --> 32:00.798
Pirelli, I don't know how
he ever missed it,

32:01.002 --> 32:03.346
but regardless...

32:03.505 --> 32:07.260
Dad wanted to see
that... that outpost.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.845
That was something
that he, um...

32:10.011 --> 32:11.371
I know he talked about
every day...

32:11.471 --> 32:14.099
was seeing and trying
to get to see the outpost

32:14.307 --> 32:15.684
before it was destroyed

32:15.851 --> 32:18.024
because it was
the last thing he built.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.813
It was the last thing
he touched.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.444
For our family as a whole...

32:23.900 --> 32:26.904
to be able to see
what Rob had built,

32:27.112 --> 32:29.240
it may give us
some sort of closure.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.371
It may give us some sort of...

32:32.409 --> 32:35.288
opportunity to say good-bye.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.465
It may give us another opportunity
to meet Rob in a way.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.810
Rob's dad had shared with me

32:50.010 --> 32:52.479
that he was talking to his
Congressman in Massachusetts

32:52.679 --> 32:54.556
to try to go into the war zone

32:54.764 --> 32:57.108
because he wanted to see
the combat outpost...

32:57.309 --> 32:58.856
the house that his son
had built.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.234
And there was no way
that the Congressman

33:02.439 --> 33:05.409
or anybody in the government
was going to let, uh,

33:05.609 --> 33:08.112
somebody go over
and do something like that,

33:08.320 --> 33:09.412
or hopefully not.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.240
So he made me promise

33:11.406 --> 33:12.884
that I would try to get
back over there

33:12.908 --> 33:15.752
and let him know that his son's
outpost was still there,

33:15.911 --> 33:18.164
that his son hadn't
been forgotten over there.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.465
The Green Beret's 10th
Special Forces Group,

34:05.669 --> 34:07.797
they knew that I was
planning to go back

34:08.004 --> 34:10.632
to Iraq with them when they
re-deployed for the second year.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.097
They also knew
that I was injured

34:13.301 --> 34:14.695
and that I had to
come back from the injury

34:14.719 --> 34:17.438
and I would have to prove myself
to them on that one, as well.

34:18.806 --> 34:22.232
I was back with the serious
gunners of ODA 0-9-4.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.405
The "machs gut" guys
who get it done.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.947
- You guys ready?
- Yeah!

34:27.148 --> 34:29.027
All right, on you,
all right, here we go, dudes.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.128
They invited me to
go through their shoot house

34:31.152 --> 34:32.574
with live fire.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.500
Stay in the room!

34:59.681 --> 35:01.900
He-Y, what do you guys got?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.570
We bypassed a pool door
on the right in the beginning.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.193
We got a team who's checking it.

35:08.398 --> 35:11.197
Hey, what do you want
for direction of movement?

35:11.401 --> 35:12.948
Where we going, sir?

35:13.153 --> 35:15.121
To the left and back that way.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.825
All right, ready?
All right! Go.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.752
Hey, remember,
it's a shotgun door!

35:20.952 --> 35:22.329
Everybody! Hey!

35:22.537 --> 35:25.882
Hey, everybody...
There's a closed door on the right.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.550
Closed door, right!

35:29.377 --> 35:30.799
- Everybody good?
- Good.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.553
- Oh, why is that door shut?
- We're moving right behind...

35:33.757 --> 35:35.350
We're moving.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.143
All right,
let's go... let's go.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.971
Ready? Everybody up?
Let's go.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.236
After this training,

35:51.399 --> 35:53.902
I'd been invited
to climb Mt. Rainier

35:54.110 --> 35:55.953
with wounded Special Operators.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.156
This would be the final test

35:58.365 --> 36:02.745
to prove that...
that the ankle was back

36:02.911 --> 36:04.788
and that I could hack it.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.551
On the rope line in front of me

36:10.752 --> 36:13.505
was blind Navy Seal, Lion Joe,

36:13.713 --> 36:16.933
who if you remember
in the American Sniper movie,

36:17.133 --> 36:21.604
he was the one who had been shot
in the face on that rooftop...

36:23.765 --> 36:28.942
and a marine recon scout
who had also been blinded,

36:29.104 --> 36:32.358
and an army soldier
who had lost his legs,

36:32.565 --> 36:37.787
and a ranger who had served in Somalia
in the Black Hawk Down mission,

36:37.946 --> 36:39.789
Kenny Thomas.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.958
And at more than 14,000 feet
at the top of this volcano...

36:46.413 --> 36:49.667
the lesson that I learned
from these Special Operators...

36:49.874 --> 36:52.218
from these wounded warrior
Special Operators,

36:52.419 --> 36:54.092
you don't quit.

36:54.295 --> 36:57.299
And it was that moment that
I was able to prove to myself

36:57.507 --> 36:59.009
that I was back from the injury

36:59.217 --> 37:00.935
and that it was time
to get back to Iraq.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.098
Neither one of you
have ever heard this story.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.652
I'm sure we haven't.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.863
The last Christmas
that Rob was here,

37:16.067 --> 37:19.947
which was, um, 2006,

37:20.155 --> 37:22.328
we went up to Uncle Ralph's
as we always do.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.012
We go up to Uncle Ralph's for
Christmas Eve... - Christmas Eve.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.675
And opened all the presents.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.552
We do what we always do.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.677
You and dad left early,
and Rob and I stayed.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.342
- Tara, what are you looking at?
- Cosette?

37:41.551 --> 37:43.519
- Robbie.
- Robbie?

37:43.720 --> 37:46.189
When Rob decided
he wanted to leave,

37:46.389 --> 37:48.767
we got in the car
and left Uncle Ralph's.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.397
We were driving home
and it was the moments

37:53.605 --> 37:56.575
that Rob confided in me
for the first time.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.824
It was one of those times
where he just let it all out.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.740
And he told me that

38:03.990 --> 38:06.789
he wasn't necessarily
planning on coming home.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.712
Oh, from Iraq, okay.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.670
So he had an idea in 2006
that he wouldn't be home.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.171
You know Rob.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.252
It doesn't surprise me,
but I didn't...

38:16.461 --> 38:19.806
As a mother, he ain't gonna confide
in me all that stuff anyways,

38:20.006 --> 38:21.724
but I did not know that.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.144
I can remember the last time...

38:25.470 --> 38:28.098
I dropped at the airport.
I saw him that Christmas.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.276
And he says, "You don't
have to hug me."

38:31.476 --> 38:33.604
Until this day, I wish I did.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.655
Well, you don't know.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.732
No, you don't.
You really don't.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.580
It is what it is.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.171
<i>L'</i>

39:02.340 --> 39:04.217
- All right, Bill.
- See you.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.769
Did you have
any idea at that point

39:09.973 --> 39:11.771
how you were gonna figure out

39:11.975 --> 39:13.272
how to get there?

39:14.602 --> 39:17.276
No, I knew I was going
to do whatever it took.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.938
- Oh, there's somebody I know.
- Hey, what's up?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.420
When I re-deployed
with them again,

39:35.623 --> 39:38.843
Rob's team was in
a completely different location

39:39.043 --> 39:41.546
very far from
Combat Outpost Pirelli.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.825
My team we're the elite
unit down here in this province.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.661
We're here to bring
credibility and legitimacy

40:12.869 --> 40:14.746
the Iraqi Security Forces.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.515
- How do you do that?
- Once we get here,

40:16.539 --> 40:18.837
we have to identify
a fit partner,

40:19.042 --> 40:20.760
foreign internal
defense partner.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.884
And the party that we identified
is the an-Nasiriyah SWAT

40:24.088 --> 40:25.590
Special Weapons Attack team.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.684
So we had to select
those operators

40:28.843 --> 40:31.847
that we felt would be
effective in this area

40:32.013 --> 40:35.017
in order to set the conditions
for sustainable security.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.477
Everybody, this on you,

40:37.685 --> 40:39.153
knock out ten push ups...

40:39.354 --> 40:43.200
and then we take a break.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.985
I'm not gonna count for you,

40:45.193 --> 40:47.241
but, you know, if you only
do two, that's on you.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.324
You're not getting any stronger.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.954
Okay, so...

41:03.002 --> 41:05.050
They can do multiple
sets of that as well.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.928
This rotation in an-Nasiriyah
did not get large scale

41:11.135 --> 41:12.603
for on-surge operations.

41:12.804 --> 41:17.025
We're leaving those type of operations
up to the Iraqi Security Forces.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.774
So, you know, the IPs are gonna
do it, the IA are gonna do it.

41:19.978 --> 41:23.073
I think that's
a sign of progress.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.115
I think that's what
we should be doing.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.914
'Ready, guys?
Yeah! Up!

41:37.245 --> 41:38.371
Keep it UP!

41:44.085 --> 41:45.928
Up!

41:47.714 --> 41:49.091
Ahh.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.818
Oh my god, we're doing an excellent
job of teaching jumping jacks.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.737
The excitement and the fun

42:02.937 --> 42:04.905
and you know the things
that they signed up...

42:05.106 --> 42:08.451
- The adrenaline stuff?
- to do or their kind doing,

42:08.609 --> 42:10.611
is kind of going
by the wayside a little bit,

42:10.778 --> 42:14.533
but everybody understands
that that is where we should be,

42:14.741 --> 42:16.038
and that's a good thing.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.760
So difference between
last year and this year?

42:29.964 --> 42:33.844
Last year we had
to walk 500 meters

42:34.052 --> 42:36.521
to go take a shower,

42:36.721 --> 42:40.521
and we were going to the bathroom
in a hole that I dug in the ground.

42:40.725 --> 42:44.525
And this year, I have people
wash and fold my laundry.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.777
Completely different
from last deployment.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.569
Honestly, there's times
where this deployment,

42:51.778 --> 42:54.907
I'd say, man, I wish we were back
up at, you know, COP Pirelli

42:55.114 --> 42:58.334
because... I mean, I definitely
miss Rob every day.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.871
I'd like to go back up.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.629
And it'd just be interesting
to see what it's evolved into,

43:04.832 --> 43:07.051
and just kinda go
back through some memories

43:07.251 --> 43:08.548
from being out there

43:08.753 --> 43:11.347
and kinda walk
those paths again.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.539
When Rob had passed,

43:40.701 --> 43:46.003
my dad, he would go down
to the coffee shop

43:46.207 --> 43:49.552
and grab a coffee
for himself also for Rob.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.477
He would come down
to the cemetery...

43:59.720 --> 44:03.770
and it would be his chance
to sit and talk with Rob.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.031
He would park his car.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.075
He would have a pin in his car

44:13.276 --> 44:15.244
where Rob's picture would be.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.164
And he would walk up

44:22.368 --> 44:24.871
to Rob's resting place...

44:55.693 --> 45:00.324
and he would take a pin
and poke Rob's coffee.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.170
And as it was dripping out,

45:06.370 --> 45:10.876
he would drink
his coffee with Rob.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.132
That was...
that was their time together.

45:23.304 --> 45:28.652
My father passed away
on September 11th, 2012.

45:28.851 --> 45:33.231
He was really sick
and in a hard place,

45:33.439 --> 45:36.363
but he knew it was... okay

45:36.567 --> 45:38.160
because he was gonna
see his son again.

45:38.319 --> 45:41.619
We wanted to have him

45:41.822 --> 45:44.245
buried as close
as we could to Rob

45:44.450 --> 45:46.953
and we know that's what
he would have wanted,

45:47.161 --> 45:49.289
so we made that happen.

46:02.176 --> 46:05.601
Tim, the medic,
who had tried to save

46:05.805 --> 46:08.365
his Green Beret brother and help
him breathe his last breathes...

46:10.101 --> 46:13.901
wanted to know that the
place that Rob had built...

46:14.105 --> 46:16.199
he wanted to know
about the changes there,

46:16.399 --> 46:19.699
but the military P.A.O.s
had said that my...

46:19.902 --> 46:23.122
my embed was with
10th Special Forces Group

46:23.322 --> 46:25.541
and was not with
1st Special Forces Group,

46:25.741 --> 46:27.084
which was now located

46:27.285 --> 46:30.164
where Combat Outpost Pirelli
was in Diyala province.

46:30.371 --> 46:32.214
They denied my request.

46:32.373 --> 46:35.172
So to get there,
I'd have to hitchhike

46:35.376 --> 46:37.219
from Special Forces
A Team to A Team

46:37.378 --> 46:40.131
more than 300 miles
around the war zone.

46:41.716 --> 46:46.267
From an-Nasiriyah
it was to Hilla.

46:47.847 --> 46:51.522
From there, went to
Baghdad to area four,

46:51.726 --> 46:54.195
which was the secret location

46:54.395 --> 46:56.318
where those serious gunners

46:56.522 --> 46:59.651
of ODA 0-9-4 were going out
and doing missions.

47:08.826 --> 47:10.828
- Alex!
- What?

47:11.037 --> 47:12.914
- Stay out here.
- Who said?

47:14.206 --> 47:16.083
All clear!

47:23.382 --> 47:25.430
Put these guys on the roof.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.952
All right, step in there, Alex.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.081
What was that?

47:48.115 --> 47:49.833
- He's a free worker.
- What does he do?

47:56.832 --> 47:58.550
Yes.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.977
The one's too young.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.112
But the other one might
be old enough to be him.

48:19.313 --> 48:20.633
Do you have
a first name, Hussein?

48:20.773 --> 48:22.025
Robert.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.577
Pull those detainees
and go down out of the element.

48:24.777 --> 48:26.857
Have the source take a look
at both those jack-asses.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.372
- Okay. Hey, Bob!
- Yeah.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.495
I'm gonna need you and Ranger
in about 3 minutes.

48:30.699 --> 48:32.326
- Ali Abu...
- Bob, you move with...

48:33.994 --> 48:36.497
- Haruz, let's go, brother.
- Ranger

48:43.546 --> 48:47.426
Did you actually
plot a course in your own mind?

48:47.633 --> 48:50.512
If this didn't work out,
you could sense an adjust,

48:50.719 --> 48:52.489
and you knew somewhere
else that you could try?

48:52.513 --> 48:55.062
Is that what... Is that sort
of how you approached it?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.486
I always hope for the best.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.361
Um, expect the worst
and plan accordingly.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.823
And I always hope
that logic will prevail

49:06.026 --> 49:07.869
and people will... will...

49:08.028 --> 49:11.373
will... will maybe have a soft spot
get what it is that I was doing,

49:11.532 --> 49:13.705
but, uh, no.

49:13.909 --> 49:18.289
From there, it was to Camp Taji.

49:29.592 --> 49:30.912
What's the deal
with this bad guy?

49:30.968 --> 49:33.096
Oh, we got
a warrant for his arrest.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.272
It's a Baghdad warrant.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.316
He was an AQI member.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.733
Mostly what he's wanted for

49:38.893 --> 49:41.442
is the murder of
other Iraqi members,

49:41.645 --> 49:43.647
mostly another clan.

49:43.856 --> 49:48.407
His tribe is very large
with I.E.D.s in this area.

49:48.569 --> 49:50.913
What's your name?
You're the RTO?

49:51.113 --> 49:52.456
- Yeah, Roger.
- And I'm Alex.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.656
Okay, I'm gonna be on your
hipper behind you, okay?

49:54.742 --> 49:56.039
Okay.

50:15.804 --> 50:18.523
An Arrow 2-5,
go ahead, it's traffic.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.476
We at this time, we
are supporting Jaguar

50:20.684 --> 50:22.436
on guard.

50:22.645 --> 50:25.114
- Check the friendlies, please.
- Checking the friendlies.

50:26.982 --> 50:29.451
We have six Humvees on the road.

50:38.744 --> 50:42.465
It's about a six
vehicle convoy, over.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.157
Okay.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.677
Okay, will do.

51:41.515 --> 51:45.315
The compound
that is directly above them

51:45.519 --> 51:47.863
to the southeast
is a hostile compound.

51:48.063 --> 51:50.031
They can declare
that area, copy.

51:52.651 --> 51:54.528
All right, go.

51:54.695 --> 51:56.868
Go, 90, 90,
last man. Last man.

51:57.031 --> 51:58.624
Get out of the hallway.

52:02.703 --> 52:04.421
Medic check.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.499
Hit it with your light.
Will it open?

52:17.718 --> 52:19.140
Go! Go! Go!

52:33.651 --> 52:34.994
Sir, these are his cousins.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.572
Round 'em up.
Take 'em outside.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.906
The first house we went to,
the target house,

53:13.107 --> 53:16.577
was the target's house,
his family's house.

53:16.777 --> 53:18.905
He was not at that house.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.550
We're just searching the house...
Hmhmm.

53:22.574 --> 53:24.201
Because this guy
is a high-level leader.

53:24.410 --> 53:27.209
We're looking for
documents, notebooks,

53:27.413 --> 53:29.086
anything that can
lead to the next guys.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.711
We call it a cascading target.

53:30.916 --> 53:32.714
Normally with
high-level terrorists,

53:32.918 --> 53:35.512
they're like code 1-0-4.

53:35.713 --> 53:38.307
It's like the highest
level of crime

53:38.465 --> 53:40.684
in the Iraqi judicial system.

53:40.884 --> 53:44.639
And so this guy was wanted
on a code 1-0-4 warrant.

53:44.805 --> 53:47.479
Why is he a bad guy?
Why do we go after this guy?

53:47.641 --> 53:49.143
Very basic broad strokes.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.353
Yeah, he runs a
terrorist organization.

53:51.562 --> 53:52.859
Which does what?

53:53.063 --> 53:56.567
The big thing he's
pushing for now is I.E.D.s

53:56.775 --> 54:00.621
And the I.E.D. threat has
kinda started up a little again,

54:00.821 --> 54:02.994
- more recently.
- Yeah, I hear in the last

54:03.198 --> 54:05.371
two weeks,
we've had three strikes.

54:05.576 --> 54:08.830
And that coincides with
being released from prison.

54:09.037 --> 54:11.711
So... - He had been detained
and then got released

54:11.915 --> 54:14.634
and back out on the streets?

54:14.835 --> 54:16.303
Yup.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.583
- Checking for movement.
- Copy.

54:50.788 --> 54:52.916
You got two of 'em
staying in the courtyard, there.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.750
- Yeah, I think that's him.
- Copy.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.020
- Are there three?
- Okay, now there are three of them

54:57.044 --> 54:58.170
running in.

54:58.378 --> 54:59.880
One is...
Oh, one's a kid.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.970
- Copy.
- There's another one.

55:02.174 --> 55:04.973
Four, five...
they have all gone

55:05.177 --> 55:07.430
into the door
of the host building

55:07.638 --> 55:09.606
and continuing to watch.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.980
Yeah, make sure you
get ahold of those guys

55:12.184 --> 55:13.731
in that area up there.

55:13.894 --> 55:15.612
Roger, that's a good, copy.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.222
GO, go, go!

55:44.925 --> 55:47.974
Go to the left!
To the left.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.811
- Where'd everyone go?
- Clear!

55:59.940 --> 56:01.908
GO; Go!

56:16.456 --> 56:17.799
Okay.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.869
He says he doesn't know.

57:27.194 --> 57:28.867
His brother was there.

57:29.029 --> 57:30.121
We have his brother,

57:30.322 --> 57:32.245
a major ARCOM in the I.A.s

57:32.449 --> 57:34.417
We got the story
of where he was at.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.040
They try to lie to 'em,

57:36.203 --> 57:38.877
but it's a lot easier
for the I.A.s

57:39.081 --> 57:41.049
because they speak the language.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.800
Three minutes
ago, we heard one individual

57:50.008 --> 57:51.726
talk to another individual.

57:51.885 --> 57:54.729
That they took the hill coming
toward the other individual.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.227
Search that tree line.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.190
Searching.

58:04.398 --> 58:06.400
I got alight
or something down there.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.829
Get right there.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.747
That's him.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.000
We are tracking
enemy personnel in that area.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.698
Look around
for the friendlies, please.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.957
They are
continuing west from there.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.960
All right, he's running.

59:07.169 --> 59:08.796
Let's watch him for a second.

59:09.004 --> 59:11.632
Close to friendlies!
He is 360 meters,

59:11.840 --> 59:12.840
and he's hunkered down.

59:14.342 --> 59:16.390
I follow.
Go, go.

59:19.765 --> 59:24.987
Okay, well, one, two, three, four.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.988
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.997
So far, it looks
like he's hunkered down.

59:40.160 --> 59:43.004
- I'm checking for movement.
- Copy.

59:43.205 --> 59:45.958
If we get a good shot here,
let's stop and look.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.686
Sir, fire some flares.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.065
See if you can stir him up.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.143
Flares.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.064
There it was.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:14.571
Okay, we got several movers.
Ah, those look like animals.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.530
Hey, there he is.
He's up and forward.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.409
There he is.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.057
Came out of the tree
line and ran into that compound.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.205
COPY-

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.350
GO; Go!

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.181
We ended up finding him
at his cousin's house,

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.180
which was still
on the family's land,

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:05.105
but again the family's land
is about two kilometers wide

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.477
in every direction.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:10.982
That's why we traveled
so many canals and so much land.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:18.448
- You guys be safe tonight.
- Roger, that's a good, copy,

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.029
and we appreciate the word.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.037
Like always, it's great
working with you guys.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.090
I managed to get myself
to Diyala province,

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:37.171
to Bakuba... what had become this
massive Forward Operating Base

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.006
Warhorse.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.564
Within Warhorse,
had been the Special Forces

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.482
Headquarters Compound.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.857
I just boldly walked up
and knocked on their door

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.688
at the Special Forces Compound

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.240
and said, "Hey, I'm Alex Quade.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.535
I spent time with the... with the
teams that were here last year.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.578
Want to let me in?" And, no.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.202
No, they did
not want to let me in.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:08.665
So that's when it was...
okay, plan B.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.496
I'll embed with the conventional
units that are here.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.833
And I will try to
hopscotch my way

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.792
from conventional unit
to conventional unit

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.969
and just try to
geographically get closer.

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:21.048
Did you have a time limit

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.679
that you knew you
were working within

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:27.228
to try to get to
Combat Outpost Pirelli.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:30.140
No, I was my own person.
I was a freelancer.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.942
I was at my own expense

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.645
and unattached with no support

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.480
and no camera crew
and no nothing.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.407
So I had all
the time in the world

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.154
and that worked to my advantage,

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.578
as did being underestimated.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.247
What exactly are we doing today?

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:53.380
We... are going to
look for some caches today

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.582
in one of our villages.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.384
Uh, we got some
Intel the other day.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.634
There's some possible
cache's out in R.A.O.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:06.435
So we're gonna jointly
with the E.R.U.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.262
go out there and see
if we can find these things.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.395
So this is pretty much
where we're at nowadays.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:14.272
Doing operations...
everything we do.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.776
So we expect to
find in these caches?

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:19.415
Well, everybody else
has been finding them,

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:21.032
- so I hope you find them too.
- Yeah?

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.234
If we don't, we're not
gonna look too good.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.203
We call it trash village.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.660
It's a whole town,
lives in nothing but trash.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.754
Everything's gonna
build character.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.836
Well, this is a whole lot
of character building today.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.293
Down by the truck?

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:36.308
Bye-bye, bye-bye,
bye-bye, bye-bye.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:28.277
I managed to get myself
within the vicinity.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:32.080
Combat Outpost Pirelli
had ended up urban sprawl.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.741
A Forward Operating Base
was growing up around it,

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.081
called Cobra.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.918
And they didn't
even realize all that much

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.674
that there was this secret

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.755
Special Forces
A team house in there.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:58.519
I managed to get myself
embedded with the cavalry unit

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:03.194
that was there, co-located where
Combat Outpost Pirelli was.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:07.490
And that cavalry unit was from
Alaska, the arctic wolves.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:20.583
They had just that week
received a coffee maker.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.131
We just got a
coffee pot two weeks ago.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:24.725
We're getting re-adapted
to the caffeine.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:28.344
It's gonna be a good clay.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.639
See the major over there?

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.299
- He's running the show.
- Hm-hmm.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.593
We're just his
little followers right now,

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.519
putting the Iraqi army first.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.099
Most of these guys...
the soldiers...

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.275
personally know
the farmers in here.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:46.275
So even to come in here
and clear palm groves

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:47.651
it's a social call.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.875
You know, they come in
here and talk to their friends.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.993
We try to enforce, you know,

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.629
the fact that they
need to clear this,

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:56.202
but they're like, "Oh, no,
it's my brother, it's my friend.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.578
He's good."

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:01.002
- He might be good, but...
- It's a happy morning gathering.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:03.045
That's all it...
It's a social call.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.214
Get a few mandarins
while you're at it.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.009
Where do you got to go
hunting for oranges and stuff?

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.257
- Yeah, I found a terrorist.
- You did.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:12.680
- It was right there.
- They were growing on trees.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.440
You pretty much
cut 'em out at the root.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.144
A terrorist...

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.731
Has anybody found anything yet?

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:27.404
Any caches? Any signs of...

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.356
- No, sir.
- Okay.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:32.613
- Just let me check.
- You're gonna go see it in the future?

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:42.042
Somebody just hit one.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.380
Get inside the palm grove!

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.959
That's a lot of fucking contact.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.046
Hey was that a striker?

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.006
And just like that...

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.263
Just like that it
changed in an instant,

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.390
and we're coming under fire
in the palm grove.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:07.193
I am less than half a mile away
from Combat Outpost Pirelli

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.395
and fulfilling my promise
to Rob's A team

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.404
and his gold-star family.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.818
I'd come all this way
and this...

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:17.745
this might keep me
from completing that mission?

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:21.499
Hey! So we're moving
back to the vehicles!

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:25.328
- I'll follow you.
- We're moving back to the vehicles now.

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:27.459
We have... Hey, we up, Mo.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.308
It's jumped to
the south marked position.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.631
Hey, Gunners be advised, we're
moving out of the palm grove.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.303
Hey, spread out, you guys.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.006
Keep eyes
for fucking trip wires.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:37.682
Sorry about that.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.057
Hey, keep eyes
to the north also!

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.608
Holy fuck.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.439
They are here.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:58.786
- Right there, you see the smoke?
- Yeah.

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:01.739
- It was in the palm grove.
- Yeah, it was in the palm grove.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.248
Shit!

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.588
Hey, let's have this
vehicle move with us.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:17.796
All right?
Improved cover.

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.059
We'll say back off
or these guys up front...

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.724
You guys up front...

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:30.109
It's the way it rolls, now.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.656
Ooh, there's
a smoke, right there.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.001
We're moving the strikers
down here for cover, all right?

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.743
I'm on your left hip, Baily.

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:43.782
We got two.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.960
There had been an I.U.D.
that was...

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.790
we figured out
was made out of 155,

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.999
which is an artillery round

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.675
and they'd
wrapped it in C-4

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.924
and added 30 pounds of munitions

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:59.802
to turn it into a wall
above an I.E.D.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:04.682
One Iraqi civilian was killed
and five were injured.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:08.018
- Do you consider that a big one?
- About as big as they get.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:10.730
They'll want
to shake your teeth.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:14.520
This is the way
we drove in to get...

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:16.007
to drive to get
to the palm grove.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.708
I'm pretty sure
it was meant for one of us.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:18.949
They knew we're here.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.403
That's why I think that
it was command detonated

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.046
because pressure plated...
we would have hit it

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.631
- by rolling over it.
- So command detonated

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:26.842
- would mean like a trigger?
- There was a trigger made.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.761
- Somebody watching and trigger manning.
- Exactly.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.208
Our strikers had
been going back and forth

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:33.915
over this area
just 20 minutes earlier.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.751
So these soldiers,
they figured that, well...

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.838
our... the jammers
that were on the strikers

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.424
must have been working
to interfere with the signal

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.636
that the trigger man for this I.E.D.
must have been putting out.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:55.062
Once we got back to Cobra,
the FOB that had grown up

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.322
around Combat Outpost Pirelli,

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.401
the cavalry unit
that I'd been with that day

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:03.035
and for the last few days
on these types of missions,

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.580
they came to me and they said,

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.282
they thought that
I'd earned my spurs,

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.707
since were a cavalry unit.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.628
And yet they had no spurs
to give out there.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:15.044
One of the guys reached into his ruck
and pulled out a Ka-bar... a knife.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:17.626
He said, well,
it's blunt, but...

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.552
these are your spurs.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:25.100
With that, I had a Ka-bar now in
my back pocket and it was time.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:30.647
A 160th SOAR-— Special Operations
Aviation Regiment bird

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.190
was coming to pick me up

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.768
and their L.Z...
their Landing Zone...

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:37.320
was inside
Combat Outpost Pirelli.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.273
So even though
the Special Forces A-Team there

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:41.907
didn't want to let me in,

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.486
they had to
if they wanted to get rid of me.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.699
We made it to the door
and knocked on the door.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.960
There was no hello.
There was no nothing.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:56.419
They let me in so that I
could have my 15 minutes

01:12:56.622 --> 01:13:00.047
as I waited for the bird that was
going to take me back to Baghdad

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:02.720
and I looked around
to see the changes.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:11.016
It was good to see
that what Rob had built

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.097
was still there.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:17.732
That this rough team house...
alone on the fringe

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:20.484
of the empire, as their
Special Forces Commander

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.489
Major Derrick Jones
had called it...

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.863
that it was still a safe house

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.411
being used by
Special Forces Teams

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:31.867
in an area that had
been an Al-Qaeda sanctuary

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.371
near the Iranian border,

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.750
where every day
was a fight for survival.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:42.502
It was still here because
Rob and his ODA 0-7-2

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.012
had built it and fortified it.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.272
I may have only
been on the ground

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:07.531
inside Combat Outpost Pirelli
for maybe 15 minutes,

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:08.945
maybe 20...

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.540
but I'd done what they'd asked

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.075
and I was able to let them know

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.878
that Rob's wall...
the T-wall with the symbol

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.586
that says Combat Outpost
Pirelli... was still there.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.048
Did you ever think to yourself

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:29.007
what are the odds...
of this working out?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.889
Pretty low to
non-existent, right?

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.371
There was no way in hell that I
was not gonna get this clone,

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.105
that I was not going to
complete this mission

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.812
for Rob's family,
for Rob's teammates,

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.068
because none of these guys quit

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:47.775
and I wasn't gonna quit either.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.466
Sunrise or sunset, do you think?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.388
I think it's a sunset.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.656
He would be on
the phone talking with

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.741
and then all of a sudden,
he'd have to go up on the roof

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.564
- and do god knows... so this is...
- Keep watch.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:25.448
Yeah, this must be what he had to
go through. - They took turns...

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.152
- Yeah.
- being up there.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.279
What he must've
had to go through.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:32.937
Oh my gosh.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:34.955
- "Keep door closed."
- This is Sparta.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.082
Get out of town.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.835
Well, look at that.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.539
For me, it's hard to imagine

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.375
that my son had...
had helped build this.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.836
It's... because he
did build things,

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.762
but this is...

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.056
it's a lot bigger
than what I thought.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.056
Look at all the
clothing hanging up.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.154
We've never, until this moment,

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.062
gotten to see their house,

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.016
and it's the one that Rob built.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.976
That's huge for us.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:07.773
- It just makes it so he's real...
- Right.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.124
And he really made an impact.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:11.742
The things that he did
were important and he mattered.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.819
But he didn't do it for himself.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.371
- He did it for others.
- Yeah.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.575
This represents him in a way

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:22.663
because... he built
this for his team.

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.042
That's who he was.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.000
That's unbelievable.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:29.811
You know, if we
were watching it with him,

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:32.235
he'd probably just sit back and
we'd be like, "You did that?"

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:34.511
"You did that?" and he'd
be like, "Yup, I did it.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.685
I guess like it doesn't
surprise me in a way.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:40.138
I could see Rob doing this

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:42.690
and not complaining
about it whatsoever.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.493
- Right, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
- Just doing it.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:46.064
Not having a problem with it.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.236
I just miss Rob.
