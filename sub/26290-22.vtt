24:21.498 --> 24:22.760

24:24.370 --> 24:27.243
The only thing that makes
sense to me is that when Jason

was doing his piece on Nicole,
he meets Angela Perez.

24:30.550 --> 24:32.248
- Right.
- And he stumbles onto

24:32.291 --> 24:33.989
something intriguing,
clearly something criminal.

24:34.032 --> 24:36.687
So he presses her
for more information.

24:36.731 --> 24:40.256
Angela gets nervous,
and so she tells someone.

24:40.299 --> 24:42.954
And that someone
ordered Jason's murder.

24:42.998 --> 24:45.478
The threat goes away,
everything goes back to normal,

24:45.522 --> 24:48.568
until you go to Angela's office.

24:49.831 --> 24:51.484
And then what?

24:51.528 --> 24:53.486
Well, she gets nervous again

24:53.530 --> 24:55.793
and tells the same someone.

24:55.837 --> 24:58.753
So our question is:
Who's ordering these murders?

24:58.796 --> 25:00.798
And why.
I mean, what is this all about?

25:00.842 --> 25:02.452
Was Angela running drugs,

25:02.495 --> 25:05.324
or did Angela meet Moya
through Keller

25:05.368 --> 25:07.413
and set something up
on the side to run drugs,

25:07.457 --> 25:10.808
or is Sophie Keller
actually involved in this?

25:13.985 --> 25:16.292
I'd say the latter.

25:16.335 --> 25:17.467
Why?

25:17.510 --> 25:19.382
Take a look at this.

25:19.425 --> 25:21.340
"Is V a front for M?"

25:21.384 --> 25:23.778
I found that in
Jason's notebook.

25:27.869 --> 25:32.656
Is Viva, the hotel company,
a front for...

25:36.442 --> 25:38.444
Moya?

25:38.488 --> 25:40.838
Now we just have to prove it.

25:40.882 --> 25:43.754
Yep.

25:43.798 --> 25:45.756
So Viva's been laundering
hundreds of millions

25:45.800 --> 25:47.540
of dollars for Moya.

25:47.584 --> 25:49.978
There are about ten different
shell corporations and LLC's.

25:50.021 --> 25:52.676
It's all right here.
It's pretty obvious, too.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.331
So Angela Perez got killed
because she got caught up

25:55.374 --> 25:56.723
in this money laundering scheme.

25:56.767 --> 25:59.552
She had to have known.
She was the CFO.

26:01.380 --> 26:05.036
So you go to see Angela and
you tell her you want to talk,

26:05.080 --> 26:06.908
she gets spooked,
she goes to Keller,

26:06.951 --> 26:08.518
and says,
"I think the FBI's on to me."

26:08.561 --> 26:11.347
So Keller calls one
of Moya's hit men

26:11.390 --> 26:13.436
and has him
take care of the problem.

26:13.479 --> 26:15.568
Sounds right to me.

death is connected to this?
