we're gonna need more from you.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.960
Like more arrogance in your face.

00:06.960 --> 00:07.960
Yeah.
Yeah.

It's just the morons outside.
They think they're funny,

00:19.960 --> 00:22.960
making my grandma do random things,
then they put it on TikTok.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.160

Pat.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.160
You absolutely smashed it.
Completely silenced the Bernabeu.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.800
Last one now, eh, boys?

00:45.800 --> 00:48.960

01:02.960 --> 01:07.960

That's heavy, that, lad.

Lingering beef about that quid
I took for going the shop for her!

01:13.960 --> 01:15.000
Let me do one. Let me do one.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.960
If I was a professional,

01:16.960 --> 01:19.960
my trademark celebration

01:19.960 --> 01:21.960
putting me face

01:36.960 --> 01:40.640
Hi, everyone.
Oh, here we go!

01:40.640 --> 01:43.960
Sorry to disturb your lunchbreak,
but I have sent out an email

01:43.960 --> 01:46.960
because it's National Diversity
and Inclusion Week.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.640
When's it gonna be
you leave us alone week?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.960
I don't care if
a Jaffa Cake identifies as a cake.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.800
Belongs in the biscuit tin.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.960
Mr Meacher and I have set up
a homework task.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.960
You need to pair yourselves up
with someone who is your opposite

01:59.960 --> 02:03.960
and experience their lives
over the next few days.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.960
Just sit down, Brimble!

02:04.960 --> 02:10.000

in front of the whole school.
GROANING

02:20.960 --> 02:24.960
You'll speak about your differences
and what common ground you found.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
Diversity...
No-one cares.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.960
Embrace it. Share it.

CHEERING

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
Who would your opposite be?

02:47.960 --> 02:52.000
Probably just
someone really unpopular, like...

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
...like her.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.960
God, you know, I can't be arsed
with these presentations.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.800
I'm just not gonna win, am I?

03:08.960 --> 03:11.960
Oh, yous are so cute together.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.960
Cheers, girl. And do you know what?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
It doesn't matter that
he doesn't speak English

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
cos I know exactly what he's saying
through his eyes.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.480
Like just then, he said,
"I'm going for me lunch."

03:23.480 --> 03:25.960
So, the Brimble just came up to you
and asked to be partners?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.960
Well, she asked us
if I was a practising Muslim first.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
I told her "na'am",
which is "yeah" in Arabic.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.960
You won't get away with that, lad.
What do you mean?

03:34.960 --> 03:37.960
Aw, we should be partners, mate.
I could win this.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.960
Diversity loves a gay.
CHUCKLING

03:40.960 --> 03:42.960
That's one of
the most beautifully tolerant things

03:42.960 --> 03:47.960
you've ever said to me. Thank you.
Knob!

03:48.960 --> 03:52.960
I'm fuming. How am I supposed
to show my acting skills

03:52.960 --> 03:53.960
when this is who I'm put with?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.960
Smoked someone the other day.
A Manchester United fan?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
Oh, yeah, fucking scruff. Divvy.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
Oh, Romeo, Romeo.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.960
Oh, sorry, he's just finishing
Pro Clubs on FIFA.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.800
Do you know, I feel for you, girl.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.960
Cos you know, me and Ziad,

04:06.960 --> 04:09.960
we were practising our audition
this morning,

04:09.960 --> 04:12.960
and you can proper get in the zone
with the right partner.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.960
Sir, me and Ziad,
we're gonna audition next.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.960
Now, he is from Libya,
so he doesn't speak English,

04:17.960 --> 04:20.800
so we're gonna do, like,
a non-verbal audition.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.960
Well, that's not gonna work.
Why?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Are you racist against people
who don't speak English, sir?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.960
Are you a big, bad Nazi,
are you, sir?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
Why do you look so guilty, sir?

04:31.960 --> 04:32.960
We...
Get your kit off.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.000
Show us you haven't got
a swastika tattoo, sir.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.960
Erm... Ziad,
in no way did I intend...

04:41.960 --> 04:43.960
Sir, he doesn't speak English.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
Oh, now
you're just a patronising racist!

04:45.960 --> 04:48.320
Come on, Ziad,
let's prove to the racists

04:48.320 --> 04:52.960
that we can show Romeo and Juliet's
connection without language.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.160

05:58.640 --> 06:00.960

I was a proper Muslim

06:00.960 --> 06:03.960
so I could do
this opposites homework with her.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.960
Astaghfirullah! I tell you
never to bring evil white girl

06:05.960 --> 06:07.960

Dad, I'm being serious.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.960
We need to be Muslim.
I don't care how serious you are.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.960
Your grandad's been trying to get
you in a mosque for years.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.960
Now some girl comes along,
and you wanna pretend to be Muslim.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960

06:33.960 --> 06:36.960
'Yeah. Go on, then.'
Sound.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.960
So, like, I know you're gay,

06:40.960 --> 06:43.960
but surely if that bird who played
Wonder Woman wanted you,

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
you obviously would?

06:44.960 --> 06:47.000
Oh, yeah, I'd completely abandon

06:47.000 --> 06:50.960
me whole genetic and hormonal
make-up for her. Yeah.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.800
I thought so, mate.
She's fit, isn't she? Yeah.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.960
You see, what's good is
you're gonna get to experience

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
a progressive, modern-day
Muslim family.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.960

even guess we're Muslim. Yeah. Wow.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.960
Apologies for my wife's behaviour.
Er, she is practising seclusion

07:22.960 --> 07:28.320
from public observation and
had the audacity to show her feet.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.960
I still see your toeys.

07:29.960 --> 07:34.800
Dad, it's Eid, and
women celebrate with us. Remember?

07:34.800 --> 07:38.960
You're right.
She may join us for five minutes.

I am earnest, me.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.800
Today, I taught Miss Prescott
that if she had an OnlyFans,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.960
I'd defo subscribe.
But I actually wanna do this task.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.960
Why, when you've already made
your mind up about me?

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
So just put a slide up saying,

08:04.960 --> 08:07.960
"The difference between me and Reece
in ten years."

08:07.960 --> 08:11.640
Then photoshop a pic of you

08:24.960 --> 08:27.000
You don't seem to care
about doing any work.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.960
Are you even going to uni or
is that a bit too grown-up for you?

08:29.960 --> 08:32.960
Lad, I'm starting

08:32.960 --> 08:35.960

I just want her to think that

It is great that
you all eat from the same plate.

It's uniquely intimate. So bonding.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960

Mohammed, why is she looking
so confused, huh? Is she not happy?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.160
You said the mahr for the marriage
had been agreed.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.960
Yeah.
Dad!

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
It's such an honour to welcome you
to our family,

10:08.960 --> 10:10.960
you know,
as my future daughter-in-law.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.000
Sorry, what?
That's not...

10:12.000 --> 10:13.960
He's always wanted to control
the woman.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.480
You have. You have.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.960
Remember when you were a little boy?
You used to take that Barbie.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
He'd say, "You're my wife.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.960
"You're my wife,
and I'm gonna hide your passport,

10:23.960 --> 10:26.320
"tie you to a radiator."
It was so cute. It was so funny.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.960
You can't say that!

10:27.960 --> 10:30.320
Sorry, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.960
I am not here to be Mo's wife.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.000
I-I am here to learn
about your religion.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.960
Yes, Mum, she's here to learn.
Apologies.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.320
Would you please excuse him, just
while he prepares the main course?

10:44.320 --> 10:46.960
Dad...
Mm!

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960

10:53.160 --> 10:57.960
We will now begin
our Eid Qurbani celebration.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.800
The ritual slaughter of a goat.

11:01.800 --> 11:08.480
Would our guest of honour...
like to perform the sacrifice?

11:09.480 --> 11:13.960
Erm... No, I respect your religion,
but I would rather not.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.800
Well, then,
Cutthroat Mo takes the reins again.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.320
That's what we call him cos
when he was five, he was a natural,

11:20.320 --> 11:22.640
real thirst for blood.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.960
Hm, so murderous.

Cutthroat Mo strikes again.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.320
Sir, why are you only seeing
lads and girls audition?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.960
Are you a homophobe
as well as a racist?

12:01.960 --> 12:03.000
Romeo and Ricardo for the win.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.960
Ted makes a great point,

12:04.960 --> 12:07.960
and we need to be more inclusive
with the languages for Ziad.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.960
I've popped an Arabic translation
I found in the WhatsApp group.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.480
Maybe Mo and Ziad
would like to audition as a pair?

12:14.960 --> 12:18.960
Erm... Yeah. Sound.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
Yeah.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

13:30.960 --> 13:33.960
Classic Shakespeare.

13:33.960 --> 13:38.000
Conflict... to resolution.
Fantastic, boys.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.960
Oh, there you are, mate.
Listen, I really need your help.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Reckon you've got any pictures
of Pat when she was younger?

13:48.960 --> 13:52.480
Cos I'm seeing hallmarks
of a decent bum, you know.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.960
I'm only messing.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.800
Though if you had any, I'd probably
wanna look out of curiosity.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.960
But anyway, you know Reece's ma?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.960
That really shy and retiring woman?

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
Yeah. She came onto me.
No, she didn't.

14:02.960 --> 14:07.960
Mate, swear down. We were in the
canteen, brought me over Alphabites,

14:07.960 --> 14:10.960
gave me a wink and I looked at them
and I realised,

14:10.960 --> 14:14.960
if I moved them round, it spelt out,
"I want you, Con."

14:14.960 --> 14:16.960
I had to use the "O" more than once,

14:16.960 --> 14:18.960
but that's just a mistake
on her part.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.960
That wasn't a coincidence. There's
a lot of things that could spell.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.960
No, mate, secret code.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.000
SIGHS

14:26.000 --> 14:29.960
Proper torn now, lad.
Cos it's banter.

14:29.960 --> 14:34.960
But it's not banter because...
I wanna do it.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.640
Just, Reece is me mate.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.960
You should go for it.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.960
Well, if this week at school
has taught us anything,

14:43.960 --> 14:46.960
it's to be your authentic self,
and people should accept that.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.480
Yeah. And my authentic self wants
his head right up Jodie's arse.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.640
Nice one, lad. I'll see you later.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Aye, pilgrim,
lips that they must use in prayer.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.960
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.960
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.960
Then move not
while my prayer's effect I take.

15:16.640 --> 15:21.960
Nah, no, I'm not havin' this, me.
Right in me face like that.

15:21.960 --> 15:26.160
I'm back tomorrow.
You're dead, you sweaty lizard.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.960
Oi, you liar! What's all this about?
Gold star English student.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.640
HE SPEAKS
ENGLISH WORDS SLOWLY

15:36.640 --> 15:38.960
Aims found it on your Facebook.
Look...

15:38.960 --> 15:40.960
Oh, my God, he's still pretending.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.960
And here's me telling Aims
we don't need to vet you

15:42.960 --> 15:43.960
cos I know you'll pass.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
I vetted you anyway
because she's my mate,

15:45.960 --> 15:47.960
and something about you is dodgy.

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
In a non-racist way.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.800
We did the usual background check of
all your socials for any scandals,

15:52.800 --> 15:54.960
looking at your internet history
to make sure

15:54.960 --> 15:56.960
you're not a perv
and no naughty shoes.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.800
And you only just passed that one,
by the way.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.000
You've been added, lad.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.960
Yeah, you have.
So, don't you ever speak

16:03.960 --> 16:06.960
to either of us again in English...

16:08.480 --> 16:10.960
...or with your sexy brown eyes.
Mia-Louise!

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
SPEAKS ARABIC

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
Come back.
Still pretending!

16:18.960 --> 16:21.000
So, what was Reece like as a kid?

16:23.960 --> 16:24.960
He struggled.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.640
Wasn't his fault.
He had a lot to deal with.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.960
We didn't have any heating.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.800
Sometimes, the only food
we could afford was 9p Netto beans.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.960
I'm sorry.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.960
Sometimes, I had to send him
out into the street to steal

16:42.960 --> 16:47.960
other people's hubcaps and...
when we were really desperate...

16:47.960 --> 16:50.160
I had to shove him
through people's cat flaps,

16:50.160 --> 16:52.960
to break into their houses.
He was only four years old.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
HE SIGHS

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
Well, I see now
why he is the way he is.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.640
I'm winding you up, soft arse.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.960
Never mind
what you see on the telly.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.960
We're not all sitting round,
eating crack out of a bin bag.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.960
Look, I suppose you can say...

17:19.480 --> 17:21.960
...that it's only ever been
me and him.

17:21.960 --> 17:26.960
So, I'm very proud...
of the man that he's becoming.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.960
Oi, oi, here he is.
Here's that tenner, son.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.960
Ah! Nice one, Mum.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.960
Oh, so you can bend down?

17:35.960 --> 17:38.960
Well, in that case, you can go
and pick up your dirty plate

17:38.960 --> 17:41.960
and put it in the dishwasher,
lazy arse.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.960
Right, I'm off to work.
Give us that tenner back.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.960
Nice one. G'wed.
See you later. Love you. Love you.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.640
I think it's really great you're
so committed to your schoolwork.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.960
Bet your mum would have been
dead proud of you.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.000
Hey, Connor came onto me ma
last night.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.960
Nah, it's not funny, lad.
He told me you told him to do it.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
He actually did it?

18:12.960 --> 18:16.480
What did you say that to him for?
I don't know. Funny, innit?

18:16.480 --> 18:20.960
Nah, banter's funny.
But nobody treats me ma like that.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.960
Then be angry at him, not me.
No, you should know better.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.960
You're lucky if
I even do this presentation later.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
Though I suppose
we can tell everyone

18:28.960 --> 18:32.960
how we're so different, then, cos
one of us is proper disrespectful.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.960
APPLAUSE

18:39.960 --> 18:40.960
Good afternoon to you all.

18:40.960 --> 18:45.000
Here at Allsbrooke, we are proud
to promote a school culture

18:45.000 --> 18:46.960
that values diversity.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
So, without further ado,

18:48.960 --> 18:52.960
first up, we have Connor and Ted.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
It's mad cos...

18:54.960 --> 18:56.960
CHUCKLING

18:56.960 --> 18:58.960
...I love girls' arses,

18:58.960 --> 19:02.960
and he loves lads' arses, don't you?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.160
Kieran and Lewis.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.960
Our main differences are,
he benches 270...

19:10.960 --> 19:13.160
I bench 275.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.960
And if you look,
they're not really that different.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.960
Mine and Kieran's common ground is
we both generally love a good scrap.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.160
We'll batter anyone who wants it
and batter them again if needs be.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.960
Just slightly different in shape.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.960
So, maybe me and Ted aren't
that different, either.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.800
HE SOBS

19:34.800 --> 19:35.960
APPLAUSE

19:35.960 --> 19:40.640
But we're most similar...
cos we're both humans,

19:40.640 --> 19:42.960
and humans make mistakes.

19:42.960 --> 19:48.960
I bet any one of them sound lads
there on that picture made mistakes.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.160
Will you?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.480
Is that a pebble?

19:56.480 --> 19:58.960
Lewis, are you messing?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.960
It's not about the mistake.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.960
I want someone that'll push me
out of me comfort zone.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.960
She's had you off!

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
You're not me Romeo.

20:04.960 --> 20:09.160
LAUGHTER

20:09.160 --> 20:10.960
Fuck off!

20:10.960 --> 20:14.960
CHANTING

20:14.960 --> 20:18.320
I asked Mo's parents to tell me
a Muslim prayer

20:18.320 --> 20:21.960
because I wanted to share it
with all of you today... What?

20:21.960 --> 20:24.960
So, if you could please all join me
in a call to Salah.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.960
No, no...
Which means prayer in Arabic.

20:28.960 --> 20:34.160
♪ Sal-ah, la-la-la-la. ♪

20:34.160 --> 20:36.960
Is this real?
SHE CONTINUES SINGING

20:36.960 --> 20:39.480
I can't believe he said that to her.

20:39.480 --> 20:44.960
If he's good enough for you...
he's good enough for me.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.640
# Sitting in a mosque
That's where I wanna be

20:48.640 --> 20:55.960
♪ La-la-la-la-la

20:55.960 --> 20:59.960
♪ If he's good enough for you
He's good enough for me. ♪

20:59.960 --> 21:03.000
OK. OK...

21:04.960 --> 21:06.960
OK.

21:06.960 --> 21:12.960
And now for the final pairing,
we have Reece and Christopher.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.000
There were many differences
I experienced when being with Reece,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.160
but in truth,
I started to understand them.

21:22.160 --> 21:26.960
I now understand that a family
can abuse each other non-stop

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
but love each other very much.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.640
And I think love was our
common ground, a love for our mums.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.960
LAUGHTER

21:35.960 --> 21:39.960
You all laugh,
but you love your parents, too.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.960
It's just Reece has got the balls
to show it.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.960
He always sticks up for her,
and he always defends her.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.960
I remember
a time I was out with my mum,

21:49.960 --> 21:54.960
and... these idiots my age
were... harassing her,

21:54.960 --> 21:58.960
saying idiotic things about her...

21:58.960 --> 22:00.960
and I did nothing.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.960
So, I guess
our biggest common ground was

22:04.960 --> 22:06.800
our fondness for our mums.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.960
I just wish
I'd shown my fondness more.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.960
Show your loved ones you care...
before it's too late.

22:16.960 --> 22:22.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:27.160 --> 22:31.960
I think we have our winners.
CHEERING

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
Lad, we're loaded!

22:35.320 --> 22:37.960
Do you reckon we try and get tickets
for the Liverpool game?

22:46.960 --> 22:48.960
Good afternoon, everyone.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.960
This... is the moment
we've all been waiting for,

22:51.960 --> 22:55.960
the moment we announce
the cast of the school play.

22:55.960 --> 23:00.320
You see here at Allsbrooke,
character is destiny,

23:00.320 --> 23:04.960
and playing the characters
of Romeo and Juliet are...

23:04.960 --> 23:07.960
Who-a-a-a-a!

23:07.960 --> 23:11.960
...Aimee and Christopher.
CHEERING

23:25.480 --> 23:28.960
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

23:29.960 --> 23:34.800
It is the east.
And Mia-Louise is the sun.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.320
Do one, you liar.
I was afraid.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.480
Look, when we first met,
you assumed I didn't speak English,

23:40.480 --> 23:41.960
and you seemed to like
that about me,

23:41.960 --> 23:45.000
so I played along because...
cos you are so beautiful.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.960
I-I wanted to tell you the truth,

23:48.960 --> 23:50.960
but you kept talking
about our eyes communicating.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.960
I was afraid you'd think
our connection wasn't real.

23:53.960 --> 23:58.960
But it is.
Because it's not about our mouths.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.960
It's not even about our eyes.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.960
It's about our hearts.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.800
Well, just give me a sec, then.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.960
PHONE PINGS

24:24.800 --> 24:27.960
Pass the ball, lad.
KNOCK ON DOOR

24:28.960 --> 24:31.480
I found these on the kitchen table.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.960
It's two tickets for Friday
off Mo's ma.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.480
You can take one of your bessies
from Angie's tango class.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.960
I wanna squash this beef, Pat.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.960
I'm sick
of always looking over me shoulder.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.960
Oh, get in!
'What a goal!'

24:43.960 --> 24:45.960
