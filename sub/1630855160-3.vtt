00:07.820 --> 00:10.220
Erica and Sophie were dealing drugs.

00:10.220 --> 00:14.100
Beef comes from my cattle
and the lamb from my sheep.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.940
It's the station
I'm selling for Lloyd.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.260
Anna told me about the separation.

00:18.260 --> 00:20.700
I suppose all marriages
have their ups and downs.

00:20.700 --> 00:25.540
It's hard to believe that...that's
where the first case will end.

00:25.540 --> 00:29.820
This tragedy is inevitably having
an impact on your career

00:29.820 --> 00:32.020
and I wouldn't be doing my job
if I wasn't across that.

00:32.020 --> 00:34.540
Ben tells me that
if the PM does go...

00:35.620 --> 00:38.060
..I may be one of the contenders
to replace him.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.660
It's not your fault this has
presented you with an opportunity.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.540
Who is this?

00:45.540 --> 00:47.540
(MESSAGE ALERT DINGS)

01:08.620 --> 01:10.460
Hello?

(TYRES SQUEAL NEARBY)

01:13.460 --> 01:14.980

01:17.220 --> 01:18.980
Anybody there?

01:21.620 --> 01:24.620
Did you come alone?
Jesus Christ!

01:24.620 --> 01:26.460
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

01:27.580 --> 01:29.220
You're Erica.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.900
Sophie's flatmate.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.700
Uh, this is very Deep Throat.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.820
It's a...homage, I take it.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.460
The film - All The President's Men.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.980
Why else would we be
meeting in a car park?

01:43.980 --> 01:45.540
Because the forecast was rain.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.340
Oh, right.

01:48.340 --> 01:50.140
And I, uh, wanted to give you this.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.540
What is it?

01:53.540 --> 01:56.220
It's the reason someone
wanted to kill Soph.

01:57.340 --> 02:00.780
We had a break-in, a few days
before she was murdered.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.420
Oh, my god.

02:12.620 --> 02:15.420
The bastards have taken my laptop!
Is that all?

02:15.420 --> 02:17.420
It's the most expensive thing I own!

02:17.420 --> 02:19.460
I mean, is that everything?
Looks like it.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.540
I mean, they left your ear buds.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.700
They left my cash! Now, they must
have been stoned to miss that.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.420
They weren't after that.

02:26.420 --> 02:28.540
They took your laptop by mistake.
They were after mine.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.100
What?

02:30.100 --> 02:32.900
There's stuff on here
that people would kill for.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.060
Soph, don't try and make this
about you...

02:35.060 --> 02:36.780
E, I'm not kidding.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.220
I thought she was making it up.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.100
Why didn't you tell the police?

02:41.100 --> 02:42.580
I panicked.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.820
Once whoever knew that...
they'd taken the wrong laptop,

02:45.820 --> 02:47.380
they'd come after me.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.260
So I took it as insurance.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.020
The password is 'britchick97'.

02:54.020 --> 02:55.940
You know Sophie's password?

02:55.940 --> 02:57.860
She only had one password.
She used it for everything.

02:57.860 --> 02:59.660
Including banking.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.500
Why did you call me specifically?

03:05.580 --> 03:07.580
'Cause you can't arrest me.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.180
Sophie's mum told me.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.940
Yeah, well...

03:12.940 --> 03:14.660
the police will need
to speak to you.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.500
Me?!
You're still under suspicion.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.140
I'm in danger!
You stole Sophie's money.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.140
And then there's the drugs...
Drugs?

03:22.140 --> 03:23.980
If you just come with me...
No. No.

03:23.980 --> 03:26.580
I've given you the laptop.
I've gotta go.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.620
Erica! We need to talk!

03:31.820 --> 03:33.500
Wait!

03:46.780 --> 03:48.420
Ta-da!

03:49.580 --> 03:51.380
Sophie's laptop.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.980
What? How?

03:52.980 --> 03:54.780
Just met Erica.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.580
What the fuck?
Yes, I know. I know.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.140
You would have preferred
that I told you.

03:58.140 --> 04:00.060
You should have.
It was the only way she'd talk!

04:00.060 --> 04:01.700
So, did she?

04:01.700 --> 04:04.380
Look, the important thing is
that we've got Sophie's laptop.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.300
This is a major breakthrough.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.060
Password's 'britchick97'.

04:08.060 --> 04:09.780
We wanted to bring her in
for questioning

04:09.780 --> 04:11.420
and you let her
slip through your fingers.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.460
It doesn't work.
Oh, what?

04:13.460 --> 04:15.780
I wrote it down.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.620
Is that a 4?

04:18.780 --> 04:21.260
Yeah, try that.
You were way out of line.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.220
(BEEPING)
I thought you'd be pleased.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.140
Doesn't work.
Oh, shit.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.620
Uppercase 'B', maybe?

04:26.620 --> 04:28.380
Well, you didn't write
uppercase 'B'.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.500
How else are you gonna spell
'britchick'?

04:32.420 --> 04:34.740
It wasn't my idea.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.940
Abigail Crawford
gave Erica my number.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.420
(BEEPING)
Still nothing.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.340
Bollocks.
We'll try uppercase 'B' with '97'.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.900
You're too close to her.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.220
Erica?
Abigail Crawford.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.780
OK. We're in.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.940
She's playing you.
Abigail?

04:48.940 --> 04:51.500
Bullshit.
She thinks you're in her pocket.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
No - you're just pissed off

04:53.500 --> 04:55.860
because she tells me things
that she won't tell you.

04:55.860 --> 04:59.380
So she's told you Greg Hardy
is Sophie's father, has she?

05:01.180 --> 05:03.780
She tells you what
she wants you to know.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.660
Share the files with Cindy.
Let me know when you find something.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.300
Yes, I will do. Thank you.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.740
PM sends his regards.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.500
He remembered my name?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.220
"Your husband," he said.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.460
He wants me to stay on in Australia.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.100
Why?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.500
To take personal control
of the trade deal.

05:33.580 --> 05:37.300
He thinks it'll help
if I lead the negotiations myself.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.060
He wants you out of the way.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.620
You're a threat to his leadership.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.940
That's a very uncharitable
interpretation.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.580
Which was also my first thought.

05:56.580 --> 06:00.780
For what it's worth,
my advice would be to return home.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.780
Disobey the PM?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.620
It's not like he can sack you.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.380
He's too weak.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.300
Besides, you're a grieving mother.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.060
I'm not playing that card.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.060
I just...

06:13.060 --> 06:15.940
I just think you need to strike
while the iron is hot.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.340
Declare my leadership ambitions?
Well, not overtly, no.

06:20.420 --> 06:21.980
But you need to be there

06:21.980 --> 06:24.980
to be seen as the standard-bearer
the party can rally behind.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.780
Sounds very Churchillian.

06:29.380 --> 06:32.660
What if I return home with
a signed trade deal in hand?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.780
Oh. Or Neville Chamberlain.

06:34.780 --> 06:37.420
Nobody gives a stuff about trade.
It's just not sexy.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.460
Shall I book us flights.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.580
I'm not leaving without Sophie.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.020
Who am I meeting again?

06:48.020 --> 06:49.780
Uh, the AWP.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.620
Sounds like a far-right
militant group.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.700
Australian Wool Producers.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.380
Jesus!

06:59.460 --> 07:02.340
CINDY: So, this is from
Sophie's laptop.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.060
MEG: Oh, my god. What is that?

07:04.060 --> 07:05.660
It's called mulesing.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.740
It's where they hack
huge chunks of wrinkly skin

07:07.740 --> 07:09.260
from the sheep's backside

07:09.260 --> 07:11.100
to stop them getting flyblown.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.140
Without an anaesthetic?
Yeah.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.780
Yeah, it's barbaric.

07:14.780 --> 07:16.780
Well, so a lot of people think.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.780
What, there are those that don't?

07:18.780 --> 07:20.500
Australian farmers.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.180
Most claim that it's necessary,

07:22.180 --> 07:23.660
which is debatable,

07:23.660 --> 07:26.220
'cause a lot of the sheep end up
getting flyblown anyway.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.060
Some die slow, agonising deaths.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.780
How do you know all this?
I grew up on a sheep farm.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.900
Explains so much about you.

07:33.900 --> 07:37.780
And you think that this might be
the explosive material Sophie had?

07:37.780 --> 07:40.980
Evidence of mulesing
on Lloyd Macklin's sheep station.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.780
I think she may have thought so.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.460
But you don't?

07:44.460 --> 07:47.540
The images are distressing
but mulesing's not illegal.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.580
At least, it's not in Australia.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.620
So not a motive for murder.

07:51.620 --> 07:54.060
And not the breakthrough
some thought it was.

07:54.060 --> 07:55.540
Well, possibly.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.820
There's a whole stash of documents
from Lloyd Macklin's company

07:57.820 --> 07:59.860
and we're still
sifting through them but...

07:59.860 --> 08:02.020
this is the only thing
of interest so far.

08:03.260 --> 08:04.980
Erica was terrified.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.780
She was sure that Sophie's murder

08:07.780 --> 08:09.780
had something to do
with that laptop.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.540
She could be just trying to
pull the wool over our eyes.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.300
Was that a joke?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.980
Not intentionally, no. I just...

08:16.980 --> 08:20.140
Paea's right. Erica could just
be trying to divert attention.

08:20.140 --> 08:23.140
We might know...if we'd
been able to question her.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.260
Alright. (CLEARS THROAT)

08:28.140 --> 08:30.100
This is my sheepish face.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.780
(OTHERS LAUGH)

08:33.780 --> 08:36.220
Keep digging, just in case.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.060
(CHATTER)

08:51.940 --> 08:53.780
Excuse me one minute.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.260
Max. I hear you've spoken to Erica.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.980
She messaged me that you met.

09:01.980 --> 09:03.780
I hope she was useful.

09:03.780 --> 09:05.660
She's provided us
with some information

09:05.660 --> 09:07.780
and we're investigating
the significance.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.100
You'll keep me abreast
of any developments.

09:11.140 --> 09:13.140
Actually, I've got
some questions for you.

09:13.140 --> 09:15.020
If you've got a moment.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.780
Take as long as you like.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.260
And then some.

09:19.580 --> 09:22.500
We know that Greg Hardy's
Sophie's biological father.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.380
How?
He told us.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.300
You should have.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.420
Are you reprimanding me,
Detective Sergeant?

09:37.180 --> 09:39.500
It's a personal matter

09:39.500 --> 09:41.460
and it's not relevant.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.180
With respect, Minister,

09:43.180 --> 09:45.660
it's up to the police
to determine what's relevant.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.260
Your right. Of course.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.460
The thing is...

09:53.540 --> 09:55.580
..Simon doesn't know.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.740
No-one knew.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.380
I only told Greg
after Sophie's death.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.020
If this were to get out,
it could be extremely damaging.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.020
Won't come from me.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.780
Anything else we should be aware of?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.100
No.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.220
And if I think of anything,

10:17.220 --> 10:19.180
I'll be sure to let you know.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.460
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:23.460 --> 10:26.020
I really ought to
feign an interest in wool.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.980
Where were we?
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

10:39.140 --> 10:41.780
Hey. A lab report.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.100
From the stone fragment
in Sophie's head wound.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.140
What did I miss?

10:46.140 --> 10:48.260
While you were taking tea
at the palace?

10:49.260 --> 10:51.100
Cindy might have found something.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.100
Yeah, so, Macklin's business empire

10:53.100 --> 10:56.460
is this complex web
of off-shore shell companies.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.540
I'm not an expert but it looks like
a classic effort to evade tax.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.500
If Sophie were threatening
to expose him...

11:01.500 --> 11:03.300
Then you've got a motive for murder.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.700
So, each company has this
raft of different directors

11:05.700 --> 11:09.900
but Marjorie Eleanor Abbott is
the director of all 22 companies

11:09.900 --> 11:11.660
within the Macklin empire.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.820
So if anyone knows where
the bodies are buried,

11:13.820 --> 11:15.820
it's Marjorie Abbott.

11:15.820 --> 11:18.380
Where's Bossley Park?

11:18.380 --> 11:20.340
A world away from here.

11:33.612 --> 11:35.772
Are you sure this is it?

11:35.772 --> 11:38.652
Yeah, it's not where you'd expect
a criminal mastermind to live.

11:39.772 --> 11:41.892
Not if they're the least bit
successful.

Is this where Marjorie Abbott lives?

12:00.332 --> 12:01.812
It is.

12:10.532 --> 12:12.692
I once had a cockatoo called Max.

12:12.692 --> 12:15.732
Oh! Swore like a trooper.

12:15.732 --> 12:18.332
What was it he used to say? Um...

12:18.332 --> 12:20.292
Could we come in for a minute,
Mrs Abbott?

12:20.292 --> 12:23.892
Oh, please.
I so rarely have visitors.

12:25.372 --> 12:27.172
Thank you.

12:28.212 --> 12:30.252
"Fuck me sideways!" That was it.

12:30.252 --> 12:33.252
Would you like a cup of tea?
Oh, that'd be lovely. Thank you.

12:34.332 --> 12:35.892
I'll just put the kettle on

12:35.892 --> 12:38.892
and then I'll just pop up
to the little girls' room.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.652
I won't be more than 10 minutes.

12:42.612 --> 12:44.772
Would you like me to make the tea?
Oh!

12:44.772 --> 12:47.732
There's a pet. Um...through there.

13:08.732 --> 13:11.412
You don't think she's
run out on us, do you?

13:11.412 --> 13:13.492
Well, she can't have gone very far.

Violent.

he was often found around here.

But he's done very well for himself
and he's been very good to me.

seen anyone acting suspicious?

under such tragic circumstances.

I still want you to brief me
on any developments.

happy to provide you

26:38.272 --> 26:40.032
with whatever assistance they can.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.632
Mm-hm.

26:43.472 --> 26:49.312
Actually, um, we could benefit
from your assistance.

26:50.952 --> 26:52.712
Tell me.

26:58.712 --> 27:01.712
You two! My office, now.

27:06.512 --> 27:08.952
I've just been yelled at
by the deputy commissioner.

27:08.952 --> 27:11.112
Seems Abigail Crawford's
been onto his boss,

27:11.112 --> 27:14.152
complaining that we aren't doing all
we can to find her daughter's killer.

27:15.352 --> 27:17.552
And where do you think
she got that impression?

27:17.552 --> 27:19.152
I don't...
Don't say a word.

27:19.152 --> 27:20.712
We all know you'd be lying.

27:21.752 --> 27:23.712
Thanks to your little ploy,

27:23.712 --> 27:25.912
I've been ordered
to leave no stone unturned.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.312
Does that mean we can bring
Lloyd Macklin in for questioning?

27:28.312 --> 27:29.872
No.

27:29.872 --> 27:31.992
You can have
an informal chat with him.

27:31.992 --> 27:33.952
And on the deputy commissioner's head
be it.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.792
But you go to Macklin

27:35.792 --> 27:37.472
and be discreet.

27:37.472 --> 27:39.392
Make sure she looks that word up.

27:39.392 --> 27:41.792
Now, both of you, piss off.

27:52.472 --> 27:54.712
Are you sure you don't want a coffee?
It's very good.

27:56.272 --> 27:57.872
No, thank you.

27:57.872 --> 27:59.712
Don't drink on the job.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.912
What was Sophie's role
in your office?

28:01.912 --> 28:03.392
Intern.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.032
Which meant?

28:05.032 --> 28:07.152
Oh, I paid her very little
and she did bugger all.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.152
It was a favour to her father.

28:09.152 --> 28:11.792
She did filing, mostly.
We were digitising old records.

28:11.792 --> 28:14.272
Were you aware that she stole
a number of documents from you?

28:15.352 --> 28:16.912
No.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.512
What sort of documents?

28:19.512 --> 28:21.792
Some graphic photos of mulesing.

28:21.792 --> 28:23.792
Ah, yeah. That's not very pretty.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.592
We don't do that on our stations.
Really?

28:25.592 --> 28:28.912
Because the date stamps
on these photos are recent.

28:28.912 --> 28:30.592
Right. Not our stations.

28:30.592 --> 28:32.752
We sell to Europe. They have
different standards over there.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.432
Higher?
So the tree-huggers will tell you.

28:35.432 --> 28:37.952
Apparently you've gotta pet the sheep
before you kill them.

28:37.952 --> 28:39.872
You can't give them any hormones.
It's all bullshit.

28:39.872 --> 28:41.392
Drives up the cost of production,

28:41.392 --> 28:43.312
doing nothing for
the quality of the meat

28:43.312 --> 28:45.152
but them's the rules,
so we follow 'em.

28:45.152 --> 28:47.472
So, if your operation is kosher,
why would...

28:47.472 --> 28:49.512
Not kosher.

28:50.592 --> 28:52.312
Above board.
Mmm.

28:52.312 --> 28:54.192
..why was Sophie
gathering evidence on it?

28:54.192 --> 28:55.952
Well, you'd have to ask her that.

28:59.152 --> 29:01.032
Poor taste.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.352
She also had this.

29:03.352 --> 29:05.352
A breakdown of your business empire,

29:05.352 --> 29:08.552
showing it to be a complex web
of shell companies.

29:08.552 --> 29:10.032
Hmm.

29:10.032 --> 29:13.072
Mmm, she was a busy little bee.

29:13.072 --> 29:15.232
You don't seem very concerned.

29:15.232 --> 29:17.632
Oh, there's nothing illegal
in any of that.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.032
Reads like a dummy's guide
to tax evasion.

29:20.032 --> 29:21.912
Ooh, careful. Tax avoidance.

29:21.912 --> 29:24.472
What's the difference?
About 10 years in jail.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.952
Look, I know you think
you've got something here...

29:26.952 --> 29:28.632
Yeah, a possible motive for murder.

29:28.632 --> 29:31.792
A couple of photos of sheep
with bleeding arses

29:31.792 --> 29:33.272
and an org chart.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.832
Come on, Detective Sergeant.

29:34.832 --> 29:37.152
If I wanted to silence someone,
I wouldn't use violence.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.992
I would set my lawyers on them.

29:41.152 --> 29:43.472
Where were you
the night of Sophie's murder?

29:53.992 --> 29:55.992
I was at a business function.

29:55.992 --> 29:58.672
I got home shortly after midnight,

29:58.672 --> 30:00.552
sadly alone.

30:02.352 --> 30:06.472
So after midnight, there's no-one
who can vouch for your whereabouts?

30:06.472 --> 30:08.992
Can they vouch for you
when you're home alone?

30:15.392 --> 30:17.992
How the hell would he know
that I live alone?

30:17.992 --> 30:19.992
What do you mean?

30:19.992 --> 30:21.752
You heard what he said.

30:21.752 --> 30:23.312
Everyone's alone sometime.

30:23.312 --> 30:24.992
I think he's having me watched.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.392
Don't say I'm being paranoid.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.872
There was a car
outside my flat last night.

30:29.872 --> 30:31.352
Is that unusual?

30:31.352 --> 30:33.432
There was someone in it
and it was there for hours

30:33.432 --> 30:35.312
and it looked like
he was watching my place.

30:35.312 --> 30:36.952
Yeah. Right. Meg, listen.

30:36.952 --> 30:39.992
If somebody came to the police and
reported that, what would you think?

30:39.992 --> 30:42.392
Hey - I didn't say it.

30:51.252 --> 30:54.092
Come on in. I've got a flight
to Perth I can't miss.

30:54.092 --> 30:57.252
I just wanted to say goodbye.

30:57.252 --> 30:59.092
You're leaving.

30:59.092 --> 31:01.932
We're taking Sophie home.

31:01.932 --> 31:04.772
It's what Simon wants. And me too.

31:06.892 --> 31:08.732
You still haven't told him.

31:12.212 --> 31:14.492
Wish I'd spent more time with her.

31:14.492 --> 31:17.132
You know, maybe she might have
confided in me

31:17.132 --> 31:19.212
about whatever trouble she was in.

31:19.212 --> 31:20.852
You weren't to know.

31:24.252 --> 31:26.692
Sophie told me
that I was her father.

31:26.692 --> 31:28.852
When?
A few weeks ago.

31:29.932 --> 31:32.852
We tried to get her to travel abroad
while the election was on.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.692
She didn't.

31:37.092 --> 31:39.132
She could be incredibly stubborn.

31:40.372 --> 31:42.212
We know where she gets that from.

31:43.692 --> 31:45.572
Oh, that could be
from either parent.

31:49.172 --> 31:52.052
If I'd known that she was mine...

31:52.052 --> 31:54.132
when she was born,

31:54.132 --> 31:56.452
I would have stayed.

31:56.452 --> 31:58.292
I was in love with you.

31:59.332 --> 32:00.972
That isn't true.

32:02.132 --> 32:03.612
I still am.

32:03.612 --> 32:06.132
That you would have stayed.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.532
And I wouldn't have followed you
to Australia.

32:08.532 --> 32:10.252
Not just stubborn.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.812
We were both ambitious.

32:19.212 --> 32:21.412
I have a flight to catch.

32:21.412 --> 32:23.252
And you have an election to win.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.012
Look after that heart of yours.

32:32.092 --> 32:33.772
And for the record...

32:35.212 --> 32:37.132
..I never stopped loving you.

32:44.732 --> 32:46.652
What did the cops want?

32:47.852 --> 32:50.132
Are you seriously
walking mud in the house?

32:56.972 --> 32:59.332
What did you do with Sophie's laptop?

32:59.332 --> 33:01.532
I got rid of it,
like you told me to.

33:01.532 --> 33:03.212
How come the cops have it?

33:03.212 --> 33:04.692
What? They can't.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.692
What's going on?

33:06.692 --> 33:10.372
All that information Sophie stole,
the police now have.

33:10.372 --> 33:12.052
How?

33:13.972 --> 33:16.132
I may have lifted the wrong laptop.

33:17.172 --> 33:18.892
What? They all look alike!

33:18.892 --> 33:22.052
Fortunately, the police don't
seem to know what it is they have

33:22.052 --> 33:24.332
but I need you
to talk to your girlfriend.

33:24.332 --> 33:26.372
Find out what she knows.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.132
She's not answering my calls.
Like I give a rat's arse!

33:30.452 --> 33:31.932
Find her.

33:45.812 --> 33:47.492
You alright?

33:47.492 --> 33:50.092
No. I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

33:50.092 --> 33:51.892
I can't leave. Take her back!
No. No, Abigail...

33:51.892 --> 33:53.972
Take her back inside!
Abigail, stop it! Abigail, you...

33:53.972 --> 33:55.532
I can't! I can't do it!

33:55.532 --> 33:59.332
Ben, talk some sense into her!
I told you to take her back inside!

34:00.972 --> 34:02.852
No, don't!

34:20.572 --> 34:23.372
(MICROWAVE BEEPS)

34:35.772 --> 34:38.692
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)

34:53.572 --> 34:56.732
(PHONE RINGS)

34:58.972 --> 35:00.932
This is Anna. Leave a message.

35:04.372 --> 35:05.972
Call her on mine.

35:07.292 --> 35:09.172
You think she's dodging my call?

35:18.452 --> 35:20.372
Oh. It's...it's you.

35:20.372 --> 35:22.052
Mmm. Sorry.

35:22.052 --> 35:24.652
Does Tori know that you're
using her phone?

35:24.652 --> 35:26.452
She gave it to me.

35:27.732 --> 35:29.612
What's going on, Anna?

35:29.612 --> 35:33.252
I just need...space, Max, to...

35:33.252 --> 35:34.852
think things through.

35:34.852 --> 35:36.412
Are we breaking up?

35:36.412 --> 35:38.652
No! I don't know.

35:40.132 --> 35:42.692
Max, you're not the easiest person
to be married to.

35:42.692 --> 35:45.772
Is this about kids?
Because we can talk about that...

35:45.772 --> 35:48.052
We've talked about it.
It's not just that. It's everything.

35:48.052 --> 35:50.172
Your work, you're always
so distracted...

35:50.172 --> 35:52.132
Well, I'm here now. I'm listening.

35:52.132 --> 35:54.812
Well, now's not a good time.
I...I have a staff meeting.

35:54.812 --> 35:57.212
Now who's distracted by work?
I've got to go.

35:57.212 --> 35:59.332
Tell Tori if she does that again,
I'll block her.

36:16.012 --> 36:18.652
What's going on?
Your friend Dima just phoned.

36:18.652 --> 36:20.412
The guy who broke into
the girls' unit

36:20.412 --> 36:22.412
is there right now,
banging on their door.

36:37.492 --> 36:39.652
He gone!
You're sure it was him, Dima?

36:39.652 --> 36:42.812
Oh! Sexy bad boy, I no forget!

36:44.092 --> 36:47.092
Dima? Are you alright?

36:48.212 --> 36:50.172
(WHISPERS) He come back.

36:54.492 --> 36:56.092
Oscar Aruzzi.

36:57.812 --> 37:00.052
That's the guy you saw
break into the girls' unit?

37:00.052 --> 37:02.252
I saw him.

37:02.252 --> 37:04.532
I no see him break in.

37:04.532 --> 37:07.572
Detectives.
You looking for Erica too?

37:07.572 --> 37:10.332
As it happens, Oscar,
we were looking for you.

37:10.332 --> 37:12.252
You know the girls' unit
was broken into.

37:12.252 --> 37:14.572
Yeah, I told you.
Kids, they reckoned.

37:14.572 --> 37:16.612
You were here the day it happened.

37:16.612 --> 37:18.332
Erica's usually round mine.

37:18.332 --> 37:20.132
Sometimes I come here.

37:20.132 --> 37:22.372
Oh, maybe I see you before.

37:23.412 --> 37:25.292
Couple times.

37:28.612 --> 37:31.452
Every time I think we're
getting somewhere...

37:32.612 --> 37:34.972
And what if it was Oscar
who did the break-in?

37:34.972 --> 37:36.972
At his own girlfriend's unit?

37:36.972 --> 37:38.532
Why?

37:38.532 --> 37:40.572
To get Sophie's laptop for Macklin.

37:40.572 --> 37:42.172
Yeah, except he didn't.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.452
Anyway, the stuff that's
on the laptop, I mean...

37:44.452 --> 37:46.132
Yeah.

37:46.132 --> 37:47.972
Alright. What about this?

37:47.972 --> 37:50.092
Maybe Oscar is
the source of the pills

37:50.092 --> 37:52.492
that Sophie and Erica
have been selling.

37:52.492 --> 37:54.132
Maybe Erica owes Oscar money.

37:54.132 --> 37:56.212
I mean, we know
she stole from Sophie.

37:56.212 --> 37:58.772
Maybe he took Erica's laptop
as payment.

37:58.772 --> 38:00.412
There's a lot of maybes in there.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.972
And it would mean that the laptop

38:01.972 --> 38:03.812
has nothing to do
with Sophie's death.

38:09.212 --> 38:11.052
Couldn't drag yourself away.

38:12.052 --> 38:13.732
Well, it wasn't my decision.

38:14.972 --> 38:17.292
I'd have only ordered you back.

38:17.292 --> 38:20.732
I need you here to make sure the sale
of Winston Station goes through.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.452
I could handle that remotely.

38:22.452 --> 38:24.212
No, I don't pay you to phone it in.

38:24.212 --> 38:26.612
I can't afford for this deal
to go south and trust me...

38:27.612 --> 38:29.532
..nor can you.

38:29.532 --> 38:31.012
What does that mean?

38:31.012 --> 38:33.372
I'm just saying
it's in both our interests

38:33.372 --> 38:35.012
to make sure this happens.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.972
Well, I'm doing all I can.
Do more.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.732
Oh, that company structure
that you set up for me?

38:43.732 --> 38:46.132
I don't want you to worry but the
police have been sniffing round.

38:46.132 --> 38:47.692
I think I put them off the scent.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.452
Well, the structure
is perfectly legal.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.452
But the way in which I use it isn't.

38:52.772 --> 38:54.692
Well, I'm not gonna tell anyone!

38:54.692 --> 38:56.692
Oh, I know.

38:56.692 --> 38:59.292
I mean, I have a feeling
if they come looking for me,

38:59.292 --> 39:01.012
they may just find you first.

39:02.572 --> 39:04.772
Lloyd, is there something
I've done to upset you?

39:07.212 --> 39:09.052
Not yet.

39:11.212 --> 39:12.892
Well, enough chit-chat.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.492
You can piss off now.

39:14.492 --> 39:16.172
I'm busy.

39:20.612 --> 39:22.092
Yeah.

39:23.572 --> 39:25.052
Um...

39:36.612 --> 39:38.252
Max.

39:39.492 --> 39:41.132
Abigail?

39:42.172 --> 39:44.332
Aren't you supposed to be
somewhere over the Equator?

39:44.332 --> 39:46.012
We're not leaving.

39:46.012 --> 39:48.612
I wanted to tell you in person

39:48.612 --> 39:52.012
and rather than...summon you,
I thought I would come to you.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.132
We'll leave you to it.

39:59.332 --> 40:01.412
So, how long are you staying on?

40:01.412 --> 40:04.132
How soon can you find
Sophie's killer?

40:05.372 --> 40:06.972
Well, no pressure, then.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.772
Max, I'm sorry

40:08.772 --> 40:10.412
if I've done anything

40:10.412 --> 40:13.012
to make your relationship with
your colleagues more difficult.

40:13.012 --> 40:15.292
We're working it out.

40:15.292 --> 40:17.452
Well, if there's anything more
I can do...

40:18.612 --> 40:20.612
Give me the number
that Erica's using?

40:24.012 --> 40:28.132
Looks like, on that date, something
bounced back, insufficient funds.

40:28.132 --> 40:30.692
You'd think she'd still have
plenty of Sophie's cash.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.452
We need to find her.

40:33.452 --> 40:35.172
Is this Erica?

40:35.172 --> 40:36.932
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:36.932 --> 40:38.892
I'm meeting her. In an hour.

40:38.892 --> 40:40.612
What?

40:40.612 --> 40:43.732
Abigail wouldn't give up her number
but she did call her.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.612
Persuaded her to meet me.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.652
Same car park as last time.

40:47.652 --> 40:49.892
I think she's got a taste
for the noir.

40:49.892 --> 40:52.132
And same deal - I go alone.

40:52.132 --> 40:53.732
Max, no.

40:53.732 --> 40:55.652
Surely it's better than nothing.

40:55.652 --> 40:57.852
I want you to wear a wire.
No.

40:57.852 --> 40:59.892
She won't know
that you've got one on!

40:59.892 --> 41:01.652
Yeah but I would.

41:01.652 --> 41:04.012
Listen, just let me
talk to her, alright?

41:04.012 --> 41:06.132
I know the questions to ask.

41:11.612 --> 41:13.892
She's not convinced
I'm a team player.

41:28.292 --> 41:30.012
Thanks for doing this.

41:30.012 --> 41:31.892
You've got five minutes.

41:31.892 --> 41:35.132
Erica, I know we spoke about this
but I really think you should...

41:35.132 --> 41:36.612
(SIREN BLASTS)

41:39.212 --> 41:41.172
Stay where you are.
What is going on?

41:41.172 --> 41:43.692
Erica Paton, I'm arresting you for
the supply of a prohibited drug.

41:43.692 --> 41:45.692
You don't have to say anything
but anything you say...

41:45.692 --> 41:47.172
You fucking pig!

41:47.172 --> 41:49.252
..may be used against you
in evidence - do you understand?

41:49.252 --> 41:50.892
Put her in there.
Arsehole!

41:50.892 --> 41:53.332
Come on.
What the fuck are you doing?

41:53.332 --> 41:55.052
What you should have.

42:05.732 --> 42:07.372
I wish to make a formal complaint

42:07.372 --> 42:09.372
about the behaviour
of D.S. Driscoll.

42:09.372 --> 42:12.452
She'd be willing to co-operate if
you hadn't made deals with her.

42:12.452 --> 42:15.292
That deal got us
Sophie's laptop, remember?

42:15.292 --> 42:17.732
This is a warrant
for your CCTV footage

42:17.732 --> 42:19.732
from the night that
Sophie Chalcott was murdered.

42:19.732 --> 42:21.452
These cameras are for show.

42:21.452 --> 42:24.412
We always say we'll go to Paris
for the weekend but we never do.

42:24.412 --> 42:27.412
Oh, I'd make you.
Well, you wouldn't have to.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.572
I was thinking about
what might have been.

42:29.572 --> 42:31.172
Maybe we'd be a power couple.

42:31.172 --> 42:34.372
Politicians are,
by their nature, risk-takers.

42:34.372 --> 42:36.732
I'm supposed to write
government policy

42:36.732 --> 42:38.732
to save your grubby little deal?!

42:40.092 --> 42:42.212
If any of those bastards were
involved in Sophie's death,

42:42.212 --> 42:43.732
we're taking them down.

42:45.452 --> 42:48.452
