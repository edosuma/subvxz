WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.087
Phil, thank you so much
for helping.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.548
Especially after Jay
was so rude to you last night.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.468
I wanted to start
a new family tradition.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.011
In a way, I succeeded--

00:11.011 --> 00:13.639
we now have
Phil Un-appreciation Day.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.225
- Hear ye, hear ye!
- Nope.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.393
I hereby
declare the opening

00:18.477 --> 00:21.063
of the first annual
Dunphy Games.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.231
Hard pass.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.942
Tests of strength,
games of chance--

00:24.942 --> 00:28.111
with the champion receiving
the coveted Dunphy chalice

00:28.195 --> 00:30.989
and this gift card
to Yogurtland.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.491
Phil, it's not
going to happen.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.910
Your dissent has been noted,
town elder,

00:34.910 --> 00:36.995
but perhaps those
who've seen fewer winters

00:37.079 --> 00:38.288
should cast a vote.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.545
Who dares accept the challenge
of a noodle-joust?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.796
No sale, Dad.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.257
Oh, well.
Nice try, Son.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.176
I'll probably just drive
back to Florida, then.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.886
Great to see you guys.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.608
I just thought
with everyone growing up,

01:06.692 --> 01:08.652
a new tradition
might give us another excuse

01:08.652 --> 01:10.195
to get together
every year.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.614
Oh, baby, we can
get together today

01:12.698 --> 01:14.449
for Joe's
soccer team party.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.285
We have
superheroes coming.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.787
We have the Superman,
the X-Men.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.540
That's what Jay called
my dad and me. Ex-men.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.791
Oh!
That hurts!

01:22.875 --> 01:24.209
- Why, what happened?
- Oh, it's nothing.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.253
It's probably just
my stilter's hip flaring up.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.504
No, it's not.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.798
Oh, you don't look that good.
Do you have a fever?

01:29.882 --> 01:32.759
I don't know.
I can't tell.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.137
Ay, no,
you're burning up!

01:35.137 --> 01:38.140
Hi, I ordered your
Ultra-Soft Gel-Heel Socks,

01:38.140 --> 01:40.309
and they are both marked "L."

01:40.309 --> 01:41.476
And "L" is for--

01:41.560 --> 01:43.937
"L" is for large. Hilarious.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.064
I'm thinking I've been wearing
two left socks.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.399
I am adorable.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.568
Can you hang on a second?

01:49.568 --> 01:51.236
<i>Hello?</i>
- Claire, everything is okay,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.531
but I am taking Phil
to the hospital.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.782
He's dead!

01:55.866 --> 01:58.243
I was just
resting my eyes!

01:58.327 --> 02:00.329
Oh, God! What happened?! <i>- It's okay, honey.</i>

02:00.329 --> 02:01.955
I just have a little bit
of stomach pain.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.707
Hang in there, sweetie. I'll--
I'm-I'm-I'm coming.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.083
I'll be-- I'll be--
I'll be there.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.921
Really, Schwartzy?
Calling me while I'm putting?

02:08.921 --> 02:11.423
It's bush-league moves like that
why your wife left you,

02:11.507 --> 02:13.926
why we still play poker
and never invite you, why we...

02:13.926 --> 02:16.053
Oh, it's Gloria.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.472
Jay, pick up Joe and meet me
at the hospital!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.057
What happened?
Is it Stella?!

02:20.057 --> 02:21.350
No, it's Phil!

02:21.350 --> 02:23.143
<i>Wait a minute,</i>
I'm-I'm getting another call.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.394
Dad...
<i>I heard.</i>

02:24.478 --> 02:26.396
Okay, Haley and Luke
are working at the club.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.565
Can you grab them
and meet me at the hospital?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.775
Sure thing.
Sorry, guys.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.276
Emergency,
I gotta take the cart.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.737
- What?!
- The clubhouse is 50 yards away.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.572
Walk the first 25,
make camp,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.157
and then tackle the rest
in the morning.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.618
Forget about Joe, I'll have
Mitch and Cam bring him.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.954
<i>Phil, how's the pain?</i>
On a scale of one to...

02:41.954 --> 02:43.163
Bo Derek!

02:43.247 --> 02:44.456
Ten.
Got it.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.000
Boy, they did not
get that score wrong, huh?

02:48.252 --> 02:49.419
Good.
Yeah.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.922
Okay, it's good,
but is it wow?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.674
We're inviting eight people
over for brunch

02:53.674 --> 02:56.718
with an invitation that reads,
"Friends, Romans, Hungrymen"--

02:56.802 --> 02:58.011
they're gonna say wow.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.888
Hey, Gloria.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.974
I am taking Phil
to the hospital!

03:01.974 --> 03:04.101
What? They're taking Phil
to the hospital.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.644
It's just
a stomach issue.

03:05.644 --> 03:09.064
Please pick up Joe at soccer
and meet us over there.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.691
Of course.
Oh, but what about Lily?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.403
What is that?
A harp?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.071
No! <i>Dios m√≠o,</i> no!

03:16.071 --> 03:18.115
The angels
are coming down.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.784
You cannot have him yet!

03:20.868 --> 03:23.287
Hello?

03:23.287 --> 03:26.164
Haley, would you mind picking up
Lily from City Kidz gym?

03:26.248 --> 03:27.624
I don't have a car.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.209
Alex said she's on a date,
but she can grab Lily.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.211
Oh, crap. We don't have time
for this valet stuff.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.379
I'm going rogue.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.797
Luke, this thing's
not fast enough.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.716
Grab a nine-iron,
try to hook a bumper.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.967
Aah!

03:36.967 --> 03:39.595
Hey, Uncle Mitchell,
I'm kinda busy right now.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.930
He is?
I'm on my way.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.101
Sorry, boys,
gotta cut it short today.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.895
Hurry, hurry!
Take him!

03:52.191 --> 03:54.610
If Phil dies,
would Claire get a new husband?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.111
Okay, he's not
gonna die, bud.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.946
But to answer your question,
yes, probably.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.324
- You have to move on with life.
- Wow.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.450
Wait for us.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.077
Comin' in hot!
Comin' in hot!

04:05.329 --> 04:06.747
You're just gonna park that
right there?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.415
I did the closets
for head of surgery here.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.625
I'm untouchable.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.210
Phil, honey,
how are you?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.212
- Oh, back in the hospital.
- Oh.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.465
But better because of Elsie
and her friend IV.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.799
Oh.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.927
If it's okay, I invited IV
to come live with us.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.929
Uh-huh.
Well, I brought you something

04:21.929 --> 04:25.015
that's gonna make you feel
so much better.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.142
Oh, Surgery Bear.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.937
Our first year dating,
we went to a carnival.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.188
At the milk-can toss,

04:31.188 --> 04:33.315
there was a bear
that Claire really liked.

04:33.315 --> 04:36.318
I spent all night trying
to win it, but I just couldn't.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.613
Came back the next night
and the carnival had left town.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.491
So, I drove to Fresno,
failed again.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.784
Sacramento,
no dice.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.160
Six weeks later,

04:45.244 --> 04:47.037
- in Carson City, Nevada, it happened.
- Yeah.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.123
When I handed it to her
and saw the smile on her face,

04:50.207 --> 04:52.042
I proposed to her
on the spot.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.045
Anyhoo,
it's come with me

04:55.045 --> 04:57.381
to every visit in the hospital
since for good luck.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.800
And I was so worried
about forgetting it

04:59.800 --> 05:01.760
- that guess what I did?
- Remembered it?

05:01.844 --> 05:04.721
Well, I brought you your nice,
comfy neck pillow,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.224
and I'm gonna run right home
and get you Surgery Bear, okay?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.310
- Dad!
- Hi. Oh, honey.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.770
- Yeah?
- Just in case,

05:11.854 --> 05:14.356
I made one of my goodbye videos
for you and the kids.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.358
I posted it
in the usual spot.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.776
- Okay.
- Goodbye videos?

05:17.860 --> 05:19.236
It's nothing,
don't worry about it.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.571
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

05:20.571 --> 05:21.780
- Hey, Phil.
- Hi.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.448
- How you feeling?
- Good.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.034
Did you tell them about
the long pants?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.453
Oh, yeah, they had to
cut me out of them

05:28.537 --> 05:30.497
when th-- when they got
tangled up

05:30.581 --> 05:32.040
in the spokes
of the wheelchair!

05:32.124 --> 05:33.917
Well, they gave him
the good stuff.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.460
Well, glad you got to
wish him well.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.796
We have to get this guy prepped
for his gallbladder surgery.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.882
That means
they're gonna shave me.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.217
Should we be worried that
those could be his last words?

05:42.301 --> 05:44.052
I got this.
Phil, we love you.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.596
I love you, too.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.389
They're gonna shave me.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.932
Well, we tried.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.978
So you're sure
Phil's gonna be okay?

05:52.978 --> 05:54.229
Absolutely, <i>papi.</i>

05:54.313 --> 05:56.190
Phil is not gonna die
in a long, long time.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.441
Am I going to die?

05:57.441 --> 05:59.359
Well, Joe, it's a natural thing
that we...

05:59.443 --> 06:00.777
Bup, bup, bup.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.780
This is not a topic
you tend to handle gently.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.282
It's not your fault,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.659
but many people in your orbit
met with ugly ends.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.911
I'll handle this.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.246
Fine. I have to pick up
the party cake.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.123
It's shaped
like a soccer ball.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.209
You sure that won't scare them?
'Cause the only thing

06:15.209 --> 06:17.628
I've seen them do with
a soccer ball is run from it.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.590
Look, kid,
that's a deep question,

06:21.590 --> 06:23.258
"Will I die someday?"

06:23.342 --> 06:27.095
And I'm gonna be straight
with you about it-- no.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.597
Never?

06:28.597 --> 06:31.808
A few years back, people would
live to be around 12.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.770
Nowadays, what with
all the science they're doing,

06:34.770 --> 06:36.271
sky's the limit.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.441
You play your cards right,
and someday you'll be 200,

06:39.525 --> 06:41.527
and if you learn anything
from your old man,

06:41.527 --> 06:46.156
you'll have a gorgeous
100-year-old bride on your arm.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.161
Uh, there will be some squawking
from women in their 180s,

06:51.245 --> 06:54.122
but, uh,
you're a successful man

06:54.206 --> 06:56.834
and you've earned
your happiness.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.044
<i>What is a gallbladder?</i>

06:59.044 --> 07:01.213
Yeah, and what's up with these
organs you don't even need?

07:01.213 --> 07:02.923
You can lose a gallbladder,
an appendix,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.132
and everything's fine.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.342
Yeah,
kind of like husbands.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.969
You lose one,
you just get another.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.887
That is what you said earlier.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.348
Oh, how did I know that
was gonna boomerang back on me?

07:11.348 --> 07:12.683
I didn't bring it up
to attack you.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.142
I just wondered...

07:14.226 --> 07:16.812
have you ever thought about
who you'd end up with

07:16.812 --> 07:19.690
if, you know,
my show closes early?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.149
I would give
my right gallbladder

07:21.233 --> 07:22.442
not to answer
this question.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.944
Come on,
it'll be a fun game.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.362
Don't you want to know
who I'm thinking about?

07:25.362 --> 07:26.572
I guess.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.949
Okay, well, then, let's just
say a name on three.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.450
- Cam.
- No, come on.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.244
I think you'll be surprised
by my choice.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.829
You ready?

07:33.829 --> 07:36.415
One, two, three...

07:36.415 --> 07:38.041
- Caleb.
- You're my everything.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.210
- Y-You tricked me.
- Okay, who's Caleb?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.379
You-you met him.
At-at Jotham's party.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.797
The--
The massage therapist.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.841
Well, I guess he rubbed <i>you</i>
the right way.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.050
Cam, oh, come on.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.468
I only said a name
because you pressured me to.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.512
I've had, like,
two conversations with him.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.348
Look, I-I only picked him
because he reminds me of you.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.351
So sweet and open
and such a good balance for me.

07:56.435 --> 07:57.895
I-I thought
he might be, too.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.105
Well, then,
that's lovely.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.191
Oh, thank God.
I cut the right wire.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.859
Okay,
what is a gallbladder?

08:03.859 --> 08:05.235
The gallbladder is

08:05.319 --> 08:08.197
"a four-inch pear-shaped organ
that stores bile."

08:08.197 --> 08:09.656
Like--
Like a little bile cabinet.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.827
That's why people
want us around.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.247
Uh, Caleb.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.540
Hey, Mitchell. Hey.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.083
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.169
You can set your table up,
uh, down in the TV area.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.504
- Sounds good.
- You got it.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.589
What's going on?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.341
Uh, would you stop
being so suspicious?

08:27.341 --> 08:30.385
You said you neck hurt from
posing for our photograph,

08:30.469 --> 08:33.055
so I invited Caleb over
to ply his trade.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.431
I do not think
he's here to ply.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.225
I think he's here
so you can pry.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.893
<i>Dad's gonna be fine.</i>

08:37.893 --> 08:39.520
Since we're on the subject,
at my funeral,

08:39.520 --> 08:41.271
make sure the pallbearers
say things like,

08:41.355 --> 08:42.814
"Wow,
she's so light,"

08:42.898 --> 08:44.900
and things like,
"Is she even in here?"

08:44.900 --> 08:47.236
I don't want to be buried.
I'm donating my body to science.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.487
Haven't you already?

08:48.487 --> 08:49.780
I'm putting kettle bells
in your coffin.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.782
And make sure my cadaver
goes to an Ivy League.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.034
I don't want some hungover
freshman from Swarthmore

08:54.034 --> 08:55.410
getting his hands
all over me.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.828
Mm.
It's not <i>so</i> bad.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.038
I'm never gonna die.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.290
Science is gonna find
a cure for everything.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.959
Grandpa told me that.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.460
Quick, kids, hey, listen,

09:03.544 --> 09:04.962
Surgery Bear is not upstairs.
Any ideas?

09:04.962 --> 09:06.463
Oh, right, Dad gave it to Joe

09:06.547 --> 09:07.840
when he got his
tonsils taken out.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.924
You could've told me that

09:08.924 --> 09:10.092
before I looked
through Luke's drawers.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.761
- Which drawer?!
- We'll get into that later.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.099
Oh, come on!

09:17.099 --> 09:18.767
Damn it.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.854
Hey, honey, did you find Surgery Bear?

09:21.854 --> 09:23.564
Uh...
yeah, sure did.

09:23.564 --> 09:27.401
He's-he's right here
with his beautiful blue eyes.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.819
I always
considered them hazel,

09:28.819 --> 09:30.529
but who could tell
underneath those sunglasses?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.865
Sunglasses. Right.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.157
Um...

09:34.241 --> 09:36.827
why don't you tell me
what your favorite thing is

09:36.827 --> 09:38.370
about Surgery Bear?

09:38.370 --> 09:41.832
Well, as you know,
he's the polar...

09:43.417 --> 09:44.459
<i>...opposite of me.</i>

09:44.543 --> 09:46.628
I mean,
I hate surfing.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.755
<i>But it makes sense</i>
that a fireman would love it.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.300
Yes, of course.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.760
In my mind, he's a volunteer
fireman during the summer

09:53.844 --> 09:55.470
because professors
have those off.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.014
Professors have--
Yes.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.932
Oh, gotta run, honey.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.517
Elsie's here to give me
another shot for the pain.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.810
Don't be stingy, Elsie.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.813
Last time,
it took forever to fee...

10:07.399 --> 10:09.985
Oh, thank God
you're here.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.570
Which one of these
is Surgery Bear?

10:11.570 --> 10:12.863
Neither one.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.448
I gave him to Manny
when he went to college.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.908
Ugh!

10:22.456 --> 10:24.875
Was that Claire?

10:24.875 --> 10:27.503
I don't know, but we've
given out too many keys.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.213
Look out below!

10:29.213 --> 10:31.673
What are you doing there?!
You're gonna kill yourself!

10:31.757 --> 10:32.841
No, I won't.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.968
Dad said
I'm gonna live forever.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.261
Come down here.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.554
Is that what you told him?
Are you crazy?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.598
I didn't want to steal
the kid's innocence.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.017
Joe, I know what
your father said,

10:42.017 --> 10:43.227
but forget it.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.229
You <i>can</i> die from that.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.396
Really?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.648
Yes.
People die all the time.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.858
That's why
you have to be careful.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.193
Everyone dies.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.569
You can choke

10:52.653 --> 10:55.697
or something very heavy
can fall on top of your head.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.575
One time, I heard there was
a little kid that exploded.

10:58.659 --> 11:02.579
The nuns said that it was
because of unclean thoughts.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.914
Do you get all this?

11:03.914 --> 11:06.083
Yes, Mommy.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.085
Those are your friends.
Go welcome them.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.753
Hi, Joe.
I brought cupcakes.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.172
What's the point?

11:12.256 --> 11:14.716
- You okay with the pressure?
- If you looked under this table,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.927
you'll see I'm drooling
like a trumpeter.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.554
Hey,
sorry to interrupt.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.389
Made some hot tea
and some homemade cookies.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.807
I'm suddenly feeling
some tension

11:21.807 --> 11:23.100
in your shoulder here, Mitchell.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.977
Do you cook, like I do,
Caleb, or...?

11:24.977 --> 11:26.895
Oh, no.
Not as much as I used to.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.606
Oh, yeah, well,
nothin' says lovin'

11:29.690 --> 11:31.233
like a
home-cooked meal.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.359
I know.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.695
I had my own restaurant
for 15 years.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.989
Oh, but it failed
and you lost everything?

11:36.989 --> 11:38.699
No,
I had to walk away.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.534
It's such
a stressful life.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.161
You know, but I do miss
having someone to cook for.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.247
Cam, maybe you want
to get into these topics

11:45.247 --> 11:46.832
with Caleb
during your massage?

11:46.832 --> 11:49.376
Oh, yeah, okay.
I'll leave you guys.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.254
The knots
are melting away.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.631
- You know, I'm a drummer.
- Big one coming back here now.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.924
Are you musical
in any way, Caleb?

11:56.008 --> 11:58.594
Yeah, I was actually
in a band once.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.430
Oh. But it failed
and you lost everything?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.891
Uh, no. We actually toured
Europe for a couple years.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.767
Bought me a house
and a cabin in Hawaii.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.103
When you say Hawaii, you mean
the big island of Ha-va-ee?

12:08.187 --> 12:09.605
I'm sorry, Caleb.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.481
I just remembered
I need to talk to Cameron

12:11.565 --> 12:13.108
about the recycling bin.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.651
Would you excuse us?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.445
Sure.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.282
- You're acting crazy.
- Okay, you know what?

12:20.282 --> 12:23.327
I have some health issues
on my mind, Mitchell,

12:23.327 --> 12:25.245
and I was simply
evaluating the man

12:25.329 --> 12:28.165
who might become
Lily's stepfather someday.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.958
Cam, your--
your health is fine.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.835
You don't know that. Phil
probably thought the same thing

12:31.919 --> 12:33.086
when he woke up this morning.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.087
- Okay.
- Things lurk.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.214
Okay,
so that's what this is?

12:35.214 --> 12:37.049
You-- Seeing Phil
flipped you out,

12:37.049 --> 12:38.842
but nothing
is lurking.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.303
Okay.
Maybe I'm being crazy.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.056
How about
if I send him home...

12:44.056 --> 12:47.184
and finish
this little massage myself?

12:47.184 --> 12:49.895
Hey! Uh, everything okay
with the recycling bins?

12:49.895 --> 12:51.438
What?
Oh. Oh. The excuse.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.607
Y-Y-Yes, and listen,
about earlier, um,

12:53.607 --> 12:56.818
Mitchell has a little crush
on you and I was being weird,

12:56.902 --> 12:58.195
but we're all good now, so...

12:58.195 --> 13:00.739
No, it's actually
really nice to hear.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.199
- I just got dumped,
- Aw.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.701
so I'll take
any validation I can get.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.329
Did he say what exactly
about me he liked?

13:07.329 --> 13:08.872
I think
how not needy you are.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.041
Anyway, listen, we've put you
through enough, you should go.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.417
I'll finish the massage.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.795
Oh, absolutely not.
Please, you've already paid.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.047
Besides, when I leave,
I'm just gonna be alone

13:17.047 --> 13:19.466
in that apartment
with the parrot that we adopted.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.677
Where's Silvio? Where's Silvio?

13:21.677 --> 13:25.722
I don't know. He left!

13:30.227 --> 13:31.979
Hey, I-I just
had an impulse.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.438
Let's skip
the massage.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.775
I'll grab some wine and you can
meet me in the bedroom.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.236
Go on.
Get in there.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.119
Go away!

13:47.119 --> 13:48.745
You don't even
know who it is.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.414
It's Claire.
I need Surgery Bear.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.250
- Not a good time, Claire.
- Oh, gotta have it, buddy.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.543
You know
how in college,

13:54.543 --> 13:56.295
everybody goes through
a rebellious phase...

13:56.295 --> 13:58.255
You know how one time Alex
locked herself in the bathroom

13:58.255 --> 13:59.756
and I kicked
the door down?

14:00.966 --> 14:03.844
That's what all the fuss
is about? An earring?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.512
Ugh.
Where's the bear?

14:05.596 --> 14:07.556
Closet.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.184
I started with an earring.
No one even noticed.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.727
So, you might need
to up your game, pal.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.270
Try wearing a snake
around your neck

14:13.270 --> 14:15.731
and then act annoyed when people
want to talk about it.

14:15.731 --> 14:16.899
Drawers?

14:16.899 --> 14:18.901
I went
a different way.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.402
Uh-huh.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.529
Oh! Okay.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.281
Wow.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.617
Well, first of all, welcome.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.911
We do have more fun.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.288
I'm guessing
you like it,

14:31.288 --> 14:32.915
but you're worried
what other people will think?

14:32.915 --> 14:35.542
A passerby likened me
to a tennis ball.

14:35.626 --> 14:36.710
And you can't...

14:36.710 --> 14:39.254
hide in here
until it grows out.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.422
I ran the numbers.

14:40.506 --> 14:41.757
Even with
inside-out wearings,

14:41.757 --> 14:43.258
I'd be out of underwear
in three weeks.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.718
Yeah.

14:44.718 --> 14:49.097
Um, let me tell you about
the happiest guy I know.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.808
He stretched a tightrope
across his front yard.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.769
Didn't worry
about the neighbors.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.729
He pogo-sticked
to work, and...

14:57.064 --> 15:00.901
The point is, he doesn't care
what anybody thinks,

15:00.901 --> 15:02.152
and if he did,

15:02.236 --> 15:05.447
he wouldn't have had
half the fun he's had.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.324
Let me
ask you again.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.618
How do you feel
about the hair?

15:09.618 --> 15:11.745
Kinda like it. Yeah.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.997
How do you feel about the fact
that Jay's gonna hate it?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.375
I love that.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.128
Thanks, Claire.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.713
Yeah, I'm gonna hold on
just a little longer.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.758
I need it today. Okay.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.885
Oh. Cabinet.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.848
Come on.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.978
I hate to interrupt,

15:35.978 --> 15:37.980
but if you just scream
you'll call her back,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.315
you might want to see
how Joe's party's going.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.487
Apparently,
Joe shared the uplifting news

15:45.571 --> 15:48.657
that his friends could die
at any minute.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.037
Hey, so,
I love what I do,

15:54.121 --> 15:56.373
but I feed off the energy
of my audience.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.791
And if I'm not
getting a lot back,

15:57.875 --> 16:00.043
it's harder for me to forget
I'm a 45-year-old

16:00.127 --> 16:02.045
classically trained actor
in a body sock

16:02.129 --> 16:04.339
and a cape that doubles
as a curtain in my van.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.258
So, I'm gonna go.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.093
Jackson,
Mama's here!

16:08.177 --> 16:10.512
You told them
they were all going to die?

16:10.596 --> 16:13.390
No, only Joe,
but in a very nice way.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.350
Really? Because it looks like
the "before" picture

16:15.434 --> 16:17.019
in an ad
for chewable Prozac.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.188
Take us, too!

16:19.188 --> 16:20.731
Joe,
come here.

16:20.731 --> 16:24.026
We need to talk again
about the thing.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.611
I think I'm just gonna
go to bed.

16:25.611 --> 16:26.820
Hold on.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.906
It's true
we all die sometime.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.532
But someone like you,
so young,

16:30.616 --> 16:32.367
is gonna live a long,
long, long time.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.827
Yeah,
and the thing is,

16:33.911 --> 16:36.205
knowing we're gonna die someday
can be a good thing.

16:36.205 --> 16:38.415
Because it reminds us
to appreciate

16:38.415 --> 16:40.417
every minute
that we're around.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.295
It's hitting you hard,
isn't it?

16:43.295 --> 16:45.964
It feels like I'm never
going to laugh again.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.424
But that's natural.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.927
This is a pretty adult thing
you're dealing with here.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.845
In fact,
I'd be worried about you

16:51.929 --> 16:53.680
if you <i>weren't</i>
walking underneath a cloud

16:53.764 --> 16:54.973
for a few days.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.558
- And eventually...
- Hey.

17:02.648 --> 17:05.651
Hey.
You, me, bedroom.

17:05.651 --> 17:08.278
I got the Syrah and I want
to do something Syr-wrong.

17:08.362 --> 17:09.613
But what about
your massage?

17:09.613 --> 17:11.114
I said
I didn't want it.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.784
Come on.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.036
Mitchell, I am so happy
we're doing this.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.205
We haven't done
anything spontaneous in forever.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.915
I hope you like
what I picked out for us.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.334
It is a little fruitier
than we're used to.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.753
- Ugh, what a day, huh?
- I know.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.922
Togas
and health scares...

17:26.922 --> 17:28.340
Mitchell,
I love you,

17:28.340 --> 17:30.634
and I don't want Caleb
to get between us.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.261
Oh, so, where <i>do</i> you
want me, then?

17:32.261 --> 17:34.137
Wha...? Oh, my God.
W-What are you doing here?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.639
Me? I-- Cameron said
that you liked me,

17:35.639 --> 17:37.140
and then you said
meet you in the bedroom.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.517
You told Caleb
that I liked him?

17:38.517 --> 17:40.185
You told him
to meet you in the bedroom?

17:40.269 --> 17:41.895
I thought
I was talking to <i>you.</i>

17:41.979 --> 17:43.689
Guys, it sounds like all three
of us could really use this.

17:43.689 --> 17:44.940
Take it easy, Caleb.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.526
You'll have Mitchell to yourself
soon enough.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.986
Cam,
you're not dying!

17:48.986 --> 17:50.737
We don't know
that I'm not!

17:50.821 --> 17:52.990
I-I had a cousin
that died at my age

17:52.990 --> 17:54.616
from a
genetic condition,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.577
and it runs
on my mom's side of the family.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.954
And if you have those two genes,
you're at risk.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.415
That's why I've been acting
crazy all day.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.000
Well, then,
take a test

18:03.000 --> 18:05.627
to make sure you don't have
that pair of mom genes.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.337
Mitchell,
I did take the test.

18:07.421 --> 18:08.672
I took it
a week ago,

18:08.672 --> 18:10.966
and I've been too scared
to look at the results.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.135
Oh, honey,
I'm-I'm so sorry

18:13.135 --> 18:14.511
you've been going through
this by yourself.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.097
Hey-hey, let's look at
the results together, okay?

18:17.181 --> 18:18.974
Really?
Yeah.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.269
Okay,
here goes.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.438
- Oh, thank God.
- You're okay?

18:24.438 --> 18:25.814
No,
my Etsy order shipped.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.441
But, okay, here's the--
here it is.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.276
- You look. I cannot look at it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.652
It's--
It's negative.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.029
- What?
- You're fine. Look.

18:32.029 --> 18:33.280
- Is it?
- Yeah.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.407
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it!

18:35.407 --> 18:37.534
Oh, now, that is
something to celebrate.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.827
- Yeah.
- I love you.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.162
I love you.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.122
All right, guys,
I'm not-- I'm not dense here.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.166
I-I know this is
my cue to leave.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.253
But what
you guys have is...

18:48.337 --> 18:50.088
it's very special.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.299
You should cherish that.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.551
- Caleb...
- I am so back in.

18:54.635 --> 18:56.261
I was gonna say,
if you want to take the cookies

18:56.345 --> 18:57.429
when you leave...

18:57.513 --> 19:00.182
No offense,
but what do you see in him?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.271
Oh, no.
I'm in heaven.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.107
No. No, you're not.
Not yet. You made it.

19:09.191 --> 19:12.027
And just so you know,
Surgery Bear was here

19:12.027 --> 19:13.820
and scrubbed in
for the whole procedure.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.239
That's pretty dangerous.

19:15.239 --> 19:17.366
He's a women's studies professor.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.285
Besides, the only thing I really
needed was my neck pillow.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.412
- What?
- I knew if you didn't have

19:22.496 --> 19:24.831
something to keep you busy,
you'd worry all day.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.041
Aw, honey.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.460
You really do
know me.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.380
I'm glad you
woke up when you did.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.675
You almost slept through
the second Saturday in January.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.510
Why would you
put it like that?

19:36.510 --> 19:38.554
Hear ye, hear ye!

19:38.554 --> 19:42.808
I hereby declare the opening of
the first annual Dunphy Games...

19:42.808 --> 19:44.226
hospital edition.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.395
<i>- Tests of strength...</i>

19:46.395 --> 19:48.313
<i>chance...</i>

19:48.397 --> 19:50.023
Oh!

19:50.107 --> 19:51.733
<i>- and cunning.</i>
- Yes!

19:54.403 --> 19:55.779
Ah!

19:57.406 --> 19:58.907
Oh-ho!

19:58.991 --> 20:03.161
<i>With the winner receiving</i>
the coveted Dunphy chalice.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.080
To our champion,
Mitchell!

20:06.874 --> 20:07.916
Yes!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.585
Extinguish the torch.

20:09.585 --> 20:12.754
And that concludes
the first Dunphy Games.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.007
Uh,
Wi-Wi-Winter Dunphy Games.

20:15.007 --> 20:18.093
We'll see you all again
July 9 for the Summer--

20:18.177 --> 20:20.721
- Take the win, Phil.
- Okay.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.266
So we discovered
our dad made

20:24.266 --> 20:25.976
a series of videos
through the years.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.269
Every time
he was in danger,

20:27.269 --> 20:28.687
he made a goodbye video
for us.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.981
And it turns out
he's had the same haircut

20:30.981 --> 20:33.275
for a really long time.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.693
<i>Hey, kids,</i>
um, I've been trapped

20:34.693 --> 20:36.820
<i>in this porta-potty</i>
for some time now,

20:36.904 --> 20:38.155
<i>and as you can see by the--</i>

20:38.155 --> 20:39.573
<i>the curling edges</i>
of my mustache,

20:39.573 --> 20:41.575
<i>the, uh,</i>
the chemical fumes are strong.

20:41.575 --> 20:44.036
<i>I didn't plan</i>
to be on an airplane for Y2K,

20:44.036 --> 20:45.746
<i>but here I am.</i>

20:45.746 --> 20:49.750
<i>A quick, loving goodbye as I am</i>
surrounded by a swarm of bears.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.002
<i>If anything happens to me</i>
today, I have faith knowing

20:52.002 --> 20:53.837
<i>that the three of you</i>
will always have each other.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.672
<i>My fingers are numb,</i>
to the point at which

20:55.756 --> 20:58.675
<i>it's hard to even keep a grip</i>
on the phone.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.344
<i>No!</i>

21:00.344 --> 21:02.888
<i>- Oh, no! It's happening! It's hap...</i>

21:02.888 --> 21:05.641
<i>Oh, they're-they're just</i>
starting the movie.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.726
<i>Oh.</i>
It's-it's A Bug's Life.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.102
They're goofy.

21:09.186 --> 21:11.188
But it's sweet that he wanted
his last words on Earth

21:11.188 --> 21:12.898
be something
for his family.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.191
Yeah.

21:14.191 --> 21:15.817
Also, we've reached a point
in world history

21:15.901 --> 21:18.195
where it's become much too easy
to film yourself.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.821
Totally.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.990
Wait, what?
