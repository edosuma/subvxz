00:22.625 --> 00:25.358
Synchro: mpm

00:32.698 --> 00:34.387
Yeah, I killed my college roommate.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.260
I can't believe
you didn't know that.

00:36.385 --> 00:37.446
I stabbed her.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.380
Sorry I'm late, gang.
Play rehearsal went long.

00:40.505 --> 00:43.130
We just found out <i>Raisin in the Sun</i>
has an all-black cast,

00:43.255 --> 00:44.627
so we're sort of scrambling.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.380
I had to swing by Home Depot
for a bag of charcoal.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.633
- Oh, I'm sure it'll be great.
- Yeah, when can we see it?

00:51.831 --> 00:54.044
You will not be attending
this abortion.

00:54.634 --> 00:57.103
The director's an idiot,
the lead can barely speak English,

00:57.228 --> 00:59.100
and the second lead is
30 pounds overweight.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.185
P.-S : I'm the second lead,
and I'm starving.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.094
A calzone for Kirk Douglas here.

01:03.219 --> 01:04.842
Now, I have an announcement.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.149
New cell phones!

01:07.925 --> 01:09.276
Heads up, spaceman.

01:09.782 --> 01:10.982
I get a phone?

01:11.329 --> 01:13.155
You're putting me
on your family plan?

01:13.327 --> 01:16.259
Roger, what Dad's trying to say
is that you're a Smith.

01:16.384 --> 01:18.961
We couldn't start
a new family plan without you.

01:19.086 --> 01:21.128
Steve's right.
Steve also needs to learn

01:21.253 --> 01:23.872
how to keep his trap shut
and let me finish my own moment.

01:23.997 --> 01:27.053
You defiled my moment, son.
Right in front of my wife.

01:27.178 --> 01:29.338
Sorry, Dad, I'm just
really happy for Roger.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.798
That's sweet of you to say, Scottie.

01:33.883 --> 01:35.416
That's my nickname for you!

01:35.541 --> 01:38.536
I chose it 'cause Scottie
is your favorite <i>Star Trek</i> character.

01:38.661 --> 01:41.995
What he does isn't glamorous,
but he keeps the Enterprise running.

01:49.327 --> 01:52.731
The snack cakes are ready.
Family Game Night can start.

01:52.856 --> 01:54.321
Prepare yourselves, people.

01:54.511 --> 01:57.285
The concert of the century
is upon us!

01:57.630 --> 01:58.946
Behold!

01:59.503 --> 02:02.406
Fabulous Thunderbirds, bitches!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.514
I remember the Thunderbirds.

02:04.639 --> 02:06.876
Didn't Stevie Ray Vaughan
play with them for a while?

02:07.044 --> 02:10.151
Better. Stevie Ray Vaughan's
older brother, Jimmie.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.882
You guys are so stoked!

02:13.654 --> 02:16.787
- But we never said we wanted to see...
- Look, I got us killer seats.

02:16.912 --> 02:19.972
Dead center in the loge.
Only $17.50 each.

02:20.158 --> 02:21.724
$17.50 per person?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.326
I know. Can you believe it?!

02:23.451 --> 02:25.345
I'm not charging you
the Ticketmaster fee.

02:25.470 --> 02:26.459
I'm eating that.

02:26.584 --> 02:29.011
Along with a big, fat, pot brownie.

02:29.221 --> 02:31.665
I am gonna freak the hell out, man!

02:34.813 --> 02:36.006
Full moon tonight.

02:36.131 --> 02:38.503
Roger, there you are.
You're late for Family Game Night.

02:38.628 --> 02:41.791
- Sorry guys, I have to miss Game Night.
- What?!

02:41.916 --> 02:44.445
Yeah, the director called
a last-second dress rehearsal.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.554
- Can't you skip it?
- I wish.

02:46.679 --> 02:49.179
The production's a mess
and it opens tomorrow.

02:49.304 --> 02:52.917
Guess my practical joke of sneaking in
and trashing the stage last night

02:53.042 --> 02:55.382
didn't really bond the cast
like I was hoping it would.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.785
Be home at 10:00.

02:59.276 --> 03:01.491
Let's go see Roger's play tomorrow.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.777
I know he said not to,
but we should support him

03:03.902 --> 03:05.279
as a member of the family.

03:07.279 --> 03:08.479
Hands, please.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.573
Dear Lord, please, bless these dice

03:12.698 --> 03:14.133
and my little wheelbarrow.

03:14.258 --> 03:15.978
And please, Lord,
give me the strength

03:16.103 --> 03:18.519
to resist the temptation
to buy the railroads.

03:19.457 --> 03:20.957
Okay, let's do this.

03:21.622 --> 03:25.037
Five! One, two, three, four...
Reading Railroad. I'll buy it!

03:28.953 --> 03:30.367
All right, here's the theater.

03:30.492 --> 03:33.792
Remember, we're gonna sit in the back
so we don't make Roger nervous.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.017
I hope there's male nudity.

03:36.162 --> 03:38.969
See a package.
A stranger's package.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.803
The theater's closed.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.890
Excuse me, sir. Is there some kind
of play going on tonight?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.082
Not likely.

03:46.207 --> 03:48.756
This building's been closed
almost two years now.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.036
Really?

03:50.161 --> 03:51.823
How come you're still
sweeping up then?

03:51.948 --> 03:54.383
I love to sweep.
It's my passion.

03:54.508 --> 03:57.597
Simple to learn,
impossible to master.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.478
Just like making love.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.493
Would you like me to tell you
how a broom's like a phallus?

04:03.618 --> 04:06.495
- Maybe next time.
- It'll only take a second.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.921
They have the same basic shape!

04:09.670 --> 04:11.009
Don't leave me!

04:15.508 --> 04:17.596
- That's so bizarre.
- I know.

04:17.721 --> 04:20.444
Why would Roger lie to us
about being in a play?

04:20.923 --> 04:22.720
Hey, that's Roger's cell phone.

04:24.137 --> 04:26.643
It's a text message
from someone named Christie.

04:26.768 --> 04:30.519
She says she's running late and will be
at Pizza Overlord in 30 mn.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.848
Wait, Roger's not in a play.

04:33.259 --> 04:34.857
He's got a girlfriend!

04:35.026 --> 04:37.943
- Why wouldn't he just tell us?
- Maybe he's embarrassed of her.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.058
Oh, God, she's probably hideous.

04:40.183 --> 04:41.370
I bet she's huge.

04:41.495 --> 04:44.926
Well, even if she is,
Roger doesn't need to hide her from us.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.656
We should go to Pizza Overlord

04:46.781 --> 04:48.795
and introduce ourselves
to Roger's new girlfriend.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.869
- What a great idea!
- Why not?!

04:51.617 --> 04:53.912
Anyone else kind of hoping
she's a midget?

04:54.037 --> 04:56.873
Well, now that you've put
the image in my head, yes.

04:57.308 --> 04:59.027
But not the Verne Troyer kind.

04:59.152 --> 05:00.602
That's too midgety.

05:02.938 --> 05:04.831
Now remember,
Roger's part of the family.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.568
So if his girlfriend is a midget,

05:07.017 --> 05:08.950
we shouldn't make fun of her
to her face.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.446
We'll go to the bathroom in pairs
and laugh it out in there.

05:11.571 --> 05:13.943
Let's partner up.
Me and Hayley versus you two.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.118
Oh, my God!

05:16.859 --> 05:19.568
Roger's not seeing a girl
behind our back.

05:20.369 --> 05:22.784
He's seeing another family!

05:23.551 --> 05:26.306
I love doing "breadstick walrus"
for ya, Scottie.

05:26.431 --> 05:27.910
You and I, we get each other.

05:28.653 --> 05:30.162
He's cheating on us!

05:30.862 --> 05:32.253
Family photo!

05:33.036 --> 05:35.053
In three, two...

05:46.080 --> 05:49.754
I can't believe Roger is seeing
another family behind our back.

05:49.879 --> 05:52.614
Why would he do that?
I mean, are we not enough for him?

05:52.739 --> 05:54.190
Obviously not!

05:54.315 --> 05:55.745
I feel so stupid.

05:56.062 --> 05:58.101
My women's intuition
picked up on this

05:58.226 --> 06:00.930
five days ago and I
mistook it for ghosts.

06:01.055 --> 06:02.489
That son of a bitch!

06:02.614 --> 06:03.986
"Scottie's your nickname.

06:04.111 --> 06:06.297
"He's your favorite
Star Trek character."

06:08.374 --> 06:11.328
Stan, you didn't say one
single word on the way home.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.351
- Doesn't this bother you?
- Bother me?

06:13.476 --> 06:15.533
Why would it bother me?
I'm just looking through

06:15.658 --> 06:17.167
the mail acting super-regular.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.147
He called me by
the other boy's name!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.553
Who wants pizza?!

06:27.756 --> 06:30.597
I wish you guys hadn't left
the restaurant so fast.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.013
I wanted to introduce you
to the actors from my play.

06:33.138 --> 06:35.176
- That's who I was sitting with.
- Actors?

06:35.301 --> 06:37.813
Then why were you taking
a family photo with them?

06:37.982 --> 06:38.868
Oh, that?

06:38.993 --> 06:41.552
Family of actors, Hayley.
Family of actors.

06:41.677 --> 06:44.922
Have you never heard of the Barrymores,
the Baldwins, the Olsens, the Fondas,

06:45.047 --> 06:47.555
the Estevez-slash-Sheens,
the Gabors, the Redgraves,

06:47.680 --> 06:49.525
the Beatty-MacLaines, the Arquettes?

06:49.789 --> 06:52.672
The Quaids, the Batemans, the Culkins,
the Cusacks, the Afflecks...

06:52.797 --> 06:56.410
the Wayans, the Douglases,
the Bridges, the Dillons...

06:58.174 --> 06:59.461
the Zimbalists.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.598
- Okay, I cheated on you.
- You broke my heart!

07:06.247 --> 07:07.843
Steve, that was your Grandma's.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.360
Steve, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

07:10.569 --> 07:13.037
Look, those people you saw me with,

07:13.689 --> 07:17.245
I met them a couple of weeks ago
at a street fair in Little Eritrea.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.239
<i>I was buying the jersey
of my favorite Eritrean soccer player,</i>

07:20.364 --> 07:23.425
<i>Debesai Ghierghis Ogbazghi,
when a family approached me.</i>

07:23.550 --> 07:27.109
<i>Mr. Johnson explained that Ogbazghi
was also his son's favorite player.</i>

07:27.234 --> 07:31.218
<i>We then traded a few hilarious
stories about Eritrean soccer.</i>

07:31.912 --> 07:33.905
They asked me if I wanted
to hang out sometime,

07:34.030 --> 07:35.730
and I stupidly said yes.

07:36.740 --> 07:37.740
Sheesh.

07:40.337 --> 07:42.580
I'm sorry!
I was an idiot, okay?

07:42.705 --> 07:45.380
It was a moment of weakness,
and it'll never happen again.

07:45.578 --> 07:49.069
- Can you forgive me?
- Roger, I think we need some time.

07:50.194 --> 07:52.010
Yes, of course.
I understand.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.498
- Without you.
- Yes, of course.

07:58.904 --> 08:02.601
I'm sorry, but you've hurt us,
and we can't see you right now.

08:04.112 --> 08:06.069
My foot!
I'm bleeding!

08:07.350 --> 08:08.528
It stopped.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.632
Hey, that reminds me,
I'm gonna need my breakfast to go.

08:20.757 --> 08:24.528
Just "wrap it up. I'll take it."

08:24.763 --> 08:26.946
- What?
- "Wrap It Up. I'll Take It."

08:27.071 --> 08:28.693
The Fabulous Thunderbirds.

08:28.818 --> 08:31.302
It's one of their
two mind-blowing hits.

08:32.404 --> 08:33.937
"Oh" is right, baby!

08:34.062 --> 08:36.558
BTW, I haven't gotten
ticket money from any of you,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.990
which is cool.
I know you're good for it.

08:39.115 --> 08:41.423
I just wanted to use it
to buy some brats to tailgate.

08:41.548 --> 08:44.854
I'm not charging you for that
either; that's my pleasure.

08:44.979 --> 08:46.587
I only have one question, though.

08:46.712 --> 08:49.709
Are you... "Tuff Enuff"?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.360
Is that another song?

08:52.605 --> 08:54.278
This guy gets it!

08:54.403 --> 08:56.774
Look what I found.
Another gift from Roger.

08:56.899 --> 08:59.073
A cheap heart-shaped
box of chocolates.

08:59.198 --> 09:01.707
That'll fit right where
my heart used to be!

09:01.902 --> 09:03.989
I wonder if he's still outside.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.889
Go back to your whore family!

09:17.989 --> 09:19.914
Come on. Let's go to another room.

09:28.327 --> 09:30.549
Anybody seen that billboard
for the local news?

09:30.784 --> 09:33.091
I'm supposed to believe
that this town's best reporters

09:33.216 --> 09:35.461
happen to be from
five different races?!

09:36.381 --> 09:38.273
How did you get in?
We changed the locks.

09:38.398 --> 09:41.223
I followed you into the market,
and when you weren't looking,

09:41.348 --> 09:43.332
I took your keys and replaced them
with yogurt.

09:43.639 --> 09:46.001
Yogurt?
How the hell?

09:46.195 --> 09:48.213
I guess we all figured
you'd be with Scottie.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.187
How is he, by the way? Has he been
worrying about whether having boners

09:51.312 --> 09:53.383
at night means he's gay?
Because I have.

09:53.647 --> 09:55.056
I haven't seen him, Steve.

09:55.181 --> 09:58.665
And now I'd like to read selections
from my letter of apology.

09:59.050 --> 09:59.986
"Dear Family,

10:00.111 --> 10:01.919
"I'm deeply sorry,

10:02.044 --> 10:04.467
I've had no further contact
with the Johnsons, blah."

10:04.622 --> 10:06.594
Here's the part
I think will get you:

10:07.573 --> 10:09.595
"Without you, I'm a butterfly

10:09.720 --> 10:12.180
"who can't find the breeze
to carry it".

10:12.653 --> 10:15.864
God, I thought that was too much,
but now that I hear it, it's just right.

10:20.778 --> 10:22.587
I can't hold it in anymore!

10:24.373 --> 10:25.499
I missed this!

10:25.667 --> 10:28.395
- What are you talking about?
- This! Him!

10:28.520 --> 10:31.137
The non-existent letters!
There's nothing written on this!

10:31.262 --> 10:34.925
That's all off the top of his head!
I missed this silly son of a bitch!

10:35.182 --> 10:36.760
- Me too.
- I know!

10:37.065 --> 10:39.373
Let's forgive him. Let's forgive him
and let's forget!

10:39.498 --> 10:40.746
God, I'm gonna hug him!

10:40.871 --> 10:42.996
I've missed you, too!

10:45.551 --> 10:46.436
Move aside.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.777
Don't ever hurt me again.

10:54.486 --> 10:56.908
"Don't go chasing waterfalls

10:57.033 --> 10:58.133
"Dance break.

10:58.503 --> 10:59.903
"Please stick to the rivers

11:00.028 --> 11:02.563
"And the lakes that you're used to..."

11:03.955 --> 11:06.256
We're heading out to dinner.
Wanna come?

11:06.535 --> 11:09.076
- Where we grubbin'?
- To the food court at the mall.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.199
The mall?

11:10.324 --> 11:12.758
No, I can't go dressed like this.

11:12.883 --> 11:15.252
Please, look how Hayley's dressed.

11:15.377 --> 11:16.502
And that hair.

11:17.253 --> 11:19.594
Well, I'm not happy
with your appearance.

11:25.863 --> 11:27.734
That was a delicious mall lobster.

11:28.228 --> 11:29.104
Tony?

11:30.793 --> 11:34.971
I'm gonna go to the Tommy Bahama store
and... chill.

11:36.323 --> 11:38.155
Roger, that man is talking to you.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.533
- I don't think so.
- Tony, it's me, Norman.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.453
- He's definitely talking to you.
- Why would you say that?

11:46.704 --> 11:49.338
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- Very funny, T.

11:49.497 --> 11:53.067
We just ate with him here an hour ago.
I can't believe you're eating again.

11:53.192 --> 11:54.686
He's obviously crazy.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.924
- He's acting like he doesn't know us.
- I need to get out!

12:00.140 --> 12:01.303
There are others.

12:01.471 --> 12:05.152
What?! You said that family
at the pizza place was the only one.

12:05.277 --> 12:06.920
How many other families are there?

12:07.045 --> 12:08.670
I could ask you the same question!

12:08.795 --> 12:11.191
It wouldn't make any sense,
but I could do it!

12:13.535 --> 12:15.844
I told you I didn't want
to go to the mall.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.028
I can't believe I let you back in.

12:18.153 --> 12:19.503
I feel so stupid!

12:19.777 --> 12:23.325
I feel like one of those women
who marries her rapist!

12:24.580 --> 12:25.869
You're dead to me!

12:26.140 --> 12:28.163
You can't have both!
It's either us or them!

12:28.387 --> 12:29.884
Don't make me choose!

12:30.009 --> 12:31.458
I'm horrible at choosing!

12:31.634 --> 12:33.460
- Choose!
- No, don't make me!

12:33.629 --> 12:36.338
- You must!
- No! No! Them.

12:37.313 --> 12:39.508
I'm better at choosing
than I thought.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.235
You're choosing
those other families over us?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.917
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm not a one-family alien.

12:48.042 --> 12:49.175
I need variety!

12:49.300 --> 12:51.913
It doesn't mean I don't like you.
It just means...

12:52.038 --> 12:54.909
Well, you can't eat chicken
for every meal, you know?

12:55.034 --> 12:57.668
It's nothing against you
and it's nothing against chicken.

12:57.793 --> 13:00.086
How good is chicken, though?
Let's talk about that.

13:00.211 --> 13:02.030
Over rice?
Are you kidding me?!

13:02.479 --> 13:05.281
Then I guess
this is good-bye, Roger.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.202
I'll need your phone back.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.329
Fine.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.641
Which one is yours?

13:12.843 --> 13:15.376
You think you're the first family
that's put me on its plan?

13:15.501 --> 13:17.622
I got phones from
the Millers, the Yangs,

13:17.747 --> 13:18.897
the DuBonais.

13:23.526 --> 13:24.576
It's ringing.

13:26.672 --> 13:27.482
<i>Bonjour,</i>

13:27.607 --> 13:28.853
<i>Monsieur DuBonais.</i>

13:28.978 --> 13:30.538
<i>Pour moi?
Maintenant?</i>

13:30.663 --> 13:33.113
<i>Alors, j'ai besoin
du jambon avec la moutarde</i>

13:33.408 --> 13:36.030
<i>et les oeufs, et les baguettes...
Limonade?</i>

13:36.155 --> 13:37.963
<i>Limonade?
Deux... deux limonades.</i>

13:38.088 --> 13:39.088
Stop that!

13:40.006 --> 13:41.395
I'll send for my things.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.877
Four Guatemalans will be here
Thursday morning at 7:00

13:44.002 --> 13:45.327
with boxes and packing tape.

13:45.452 --> 13:48.448
Under no circumstances
are you to feed them or tip them.

13:48.573 --> 13:50.572
If the job is done well,
they will each be rewarded

13:50.697 --> 13:52.147
with a large fries.

14:00.753 --> 14:03.467
- Haven't heard from Roger in days.
- Who cares?!

14:03.592 --> 14:06.734
What bums me out is that you traded
St. James for Marvin Gardens.

14:06.859 --> 14:08.612
Look, Steve has
the whole corner now.

14:08.737 --> 14:11.669
If I roll a four through a seven,
I have to give that all my money.

14:11.794 --> 14:13.345
Good, you're all here together.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.770
Now again, about the tickets,
just so you know,

14:15.964 --> 14:17.589
I've got people on the Craigslist

14:17.714 --> 14:20.984
- who are willing to pay over face.
- Maybe you should just sell 'em.

14:22.891 --> 14:24.825
That wasn't cool of me
to pressure you.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.138
You take your time.

14:26.263 --> 14:28.819
And if you've never been
to a concert with me,

14:28.944 --> 14:30.994
you are in for a treat.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.664
I yell constantly!

14:44.918 --> 14:47.165
Oh, sorry, the calendar
was a month off.

14:47.290 --> 14:49.599
I thought it was
my father's birthday again.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.971
Now who is this
and why are you calling?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.447
You were his emergency contact.
We didn't know what else to do.

15:03.572 --> 15:04.761
What happened to him?

15:04.886 --> 15:06.863
Well, take a look at
this security video.

15:07.557 --> 15:10.380
He arrives with this family
at 9:00 A.M.

15:10.505 --> 15:13.064
Churros, elephant ears,
the whole nine yards.

15:13.189 --> 15:14.310
By 11:00 A.M.,

15:14.435 --> 15:16.873
he was in line for the flume,
which he rode 16 times,

15:17.041 --> 15:18.375
all with different families.

15:18.671 --> 15:21.711
Two hours later, he's Puss 'N Boots
with yet another family,

15:22.049 --> 15:25.627
eating a caramel apple, watching
an animatronic bear play the fiddle.

15:25.752 --> 15:29.052
As the day progressed,
he was with 9 more families

15:29.220 --> 15:31.763
in nine more outfits, the rights
to which I doubt he owns,

15:32.062 --> 15:35.587
until we found him like this,
gurgling, slumped over a teacup

15:35.712 --> 15:37.399
and urinating on a pinwheel.

15:37.524 --> 15:39.324
I went on a family bender.

15:39.582 --> 15:41.196
I have a problem!

15:46.836 --> 15:47.836
Help me!

15:54.287 --> 15:57.429
You're here for me
after all I've put you through?

15:57.554 --> 15:59.459
You're good, simple people.

15:59.642 --> 16:01.298
You're an addict, Roger,

16:01.423 --> 16:03.878
but luckily, we found
someone who can help.

16:04.293 --> 16:06.102
Remember where you got
your retainer?

16:06.227 --> 16:08.725
Upstairs from there
is a psychologist.

16:08.850 --> 16:12.214
- And what's upstairs from there?
- I think an SAT preparation class.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.305
I'll go.

16:15.616 --> 16:17.460
Everyone, this is Roger.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.456
He'll be joining us.

16:19.581 --> 16:21.330
Roger, why don't you tell everyone

16:21.455 --> 16:23.648
what your expectations
are for group therapy?

16:24.978 --> 16:28.769
Okay, first of all, I don't believe
in any of this therapy nonsense.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.071
The Logans!

16:30.375 --> 16:32.139
Oh, my God, the Logans!

16:32.310 --> 16:35.743
The 1st family I ever lived with,
and then they abandoned me years ago,

16:35.868 --> 16:38.514
and I haven't been able
to trust anybody ever since!

16:38.879 --> 16:41.390
Thank you, doctor.
You are a miracle worker.

16:42.723 --> 16:45.353
You see that, people?
That's how you share.

16:45.478 --> 16:47.323
That's a freakin' breakthrough.

16:47.448 --> 16:48.887
You make me sick!

16:52.856 --> 16:55.867
Oh, my God, there it is:
the Logan house.

16:56.255 --> 16:58.738
I haven't been back here
for 17 years.

16:59.205 --> 17:02.007
Ever since we took that
family road trip to Montana.

17:02.132 --> 17:04.314
<i>When we stopped for gas,
everybody had a chore.</i>

17:04.663 --> 17:06.400
<i>Mine was to get Doritos.</i>

17:06.525 --> 17:08.971
<i>Cool Ranch had just come out.
It was...</i>

17:09.852 --> 17:11.051
<i>what a summer.</i>

17:12.715 --> 17:15.367
<i>But when I got back
to the pumps, they were gone.</i>

17:19.913 --> 17:21.794
This was good.
Let's go home, Stan.

17:21.919 --> 17:24.352
No, Roger, you have
to confront them.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.425
It's important to face your fears.

17:27.054 --> 17:29.113
You know, there was a time
when I was terrified

17:29.238 --> 17:30.832
of an uncircumcised penis.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.050
So I moved to Brussels and hunkered down
in a gym locker room for six long days.

17:36.041 --> 17:38.591
You're right.
I've got to get past this.

17:42.091 --> 17:44.062
These khakis are tight on me.

17:50.096 --> 17:52.496
- Charles?
- Oh, my God.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.239
Brad, Jenny,

17:54.493 --> 17:56.505
you hurt me.
You hurt me bad.

17:56.630 --> 17:59.404
You made it impossible for me
to have healthy relationships

17:59.529 --> 18:01.663
with other families.
I need to know.

18:02.127 --> 18:03.852
Why did you leave me like that?

18:03.977 --> 18:06.787
You rented a room from us
and refused to pay.

18:06.912 --> 18:09.781
- I paid you in laughter!
- We were afraid of you!

18:09.906 --> 18:13.088
Jenny, you better shut up right now
or I will cut your face.

18:13.213 --> 18:14.459
 You missed out.

18:14.584 --> 18:16.720
These people, the Smiths,

18:16.889 --> 18:18.937
they love me, with all my faults.

18:19.062 --> 18:21.699
- What's going on?
- Oh, look, it's Tyler.

18:21.824 --> 18:23.774
All grown up like a big shot.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.840
You turned out cute.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.442
Real cute.

18:28.057 --> 18:29.057
Damn it.

18:30.203 --> 18:32.553
I'm laughing now 'cause I'm nervous.

18:35.608 --> 18:38.226
Oh, boy, these khakis are
not gettin' any looser.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.934
Let's go home.

18:40.199 --> 18:42.537
You mean you're ready
to give up the others?

18:42.705 --> 18:44.698
I'm a one-family alien.

18:46.232 --> 18:48.033
There's just one more thing.

18:48.987 --> 18:51.276
My phone that you can't
personalize the ring on

18:51.401 --> 18:53.051
that I'm happy to have.

18:57.603 --> 18:58.867
11:00 A.M.?!

18:59.012 --> 19:00.612
That... that can't be!

19:00.737 --> 19:03.685
I went to bed at 6:00 last night,
just for a little catnap

19:03.810 --> 19:06.184
to keep me fresh
for the Fabulous Thunderbirds!

19:07.496 --> 19:10.557
I- I slept for 17 hours?!

19:22.644 --> 19:24.388
That game is so scary!

19:25.094 --> 19:27.467
You really think you're gonna die
when he tags you.

19:27.592 --> 19:29.590
Then when you realize
you're still alive,

19:29.715 --> 19:31.165
it makes you laugh!

19:31.848 --> 19:34.255
There you are!
We missed you at the concert.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.519
You went?!

19:35.883 --> 19:37.717
Why did nobody wake me?

19:38.271 --> 19:41.736
Isn't there a saying about
not waking a sleeping fish?

19:41.883 --> 19:42.883
What?!

19:43.066 --> 19:45.252
It was the perfect family night.

19:45.377 --> 19:47.374
Don't worry, Klaus.
Your ticket didn't go to waste.

19:47.499 --> 19:49.620
We gave it to that koala bear
from the CIA

19:49.745 --> 19:51.430
with the brain of a homeless man.

19:51.555 --> 19:52.555
Hey, girl.

19:53.972 --> 19:55.238
Hey, girl.

19:56.734 --> 19:59.365
- Hey, girl, I know you hear me.
- What?!

19:59.490 --> 20:03.225
Easy, baby. I'm just a squirrel
trying to get a nut.

20:03.592 --> 20:05.703
Except I'm a koala.

20:07.434 --> 20:09.579
<i>Reginald didn't have a job</i>

20:10.768 --> 20:12.502
<i>The weather was changin'</i>

20:12.670 --> 20:14.083
<i>He looked like a slob</i>

20:14.208 --> 20:17.453
<i>But then one cold, dark winter day</i>

20:17.800 --> 20:20.844
<i>Came along an opportuni-tay</i>

20:21.013 --> 20:22.813
<i>So he followed the address</i>

20:23.004 --> 20:24.347
<i>to get his free meal</i>

20:24.516 --> 20:25.752
<i>On the surface, it looked</i>

20:25.877 --> 20:27.686
<i>like a hell of a deal</i>

20:28.019 --> 20:29.519
<i>But when he took his first bite</i>

20:29.688 --> 20:31.303
<i>They put the helmet on tight</i>

20:31.428 --> 20:33.178
<i>Then he heard the hum</i>

20:33.303 --> 20:35.236
<i>Of a hundred-million-watt</i>

20:35.361 --> 20:36.361
<i>laser!</i>

20:36.861 --> 20:38.903
<i>It was scary, y'all.</i>

20:39.072 --> 20:41.906
<i>He's Reginald,
and he used to be nothin'</i>

20:42.238 --> 20:43.585
<i>Now he's a koala,</i>

20:43.951 --> 20:45.368
<i>and he's cute as a button!</i>

20:45.537 --> 20:46.982
<i>He's Reginald,</i>

20:47.107 --> 20:49.186
<i>and he used to be nothin'</i>

20:49.311 --> 20:50.522
<i>Now he's a koala,</i>

20:50.647 --> 20:52.704
<i>and he's cute as a button</i>

20:53.044 --> 20:54.268
<i>Now he's a koala,</i>

20:54.393 --> 20:56.193
<i>and he's cute as a button!</i>

20:57.183 --> 20:58.696
Anyways, maybe sometimes

20:58.821 --> 21:00.133
I'll be on missions,

21:00.258 --> 21:02.254
and sometimes I'll just
be here at the house.

21:02.379 --> 21:04.440
But my #1 duty is

21:04.565 --> 21:07.390
to say howdy-doody to your fruity.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.256
<i>He's cute as a button.</i>
