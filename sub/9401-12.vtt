00:56.343 --> 00:58.325
It's gonna be a good show.

01:07.175 --> 01:08.275
Jamie?

01:11.611 --> 01:13.436
Moving to Spain is bullsh...

01:22.041 --> 01:23.138
Alex?

01:23.546 --> 01:26.059
Alex!

01:26.882 --> 01:28.395
Alex!

01:38.091 --> 01:39.250
I got the job.

01:41.245 --> 01:42.444
In Los Angeles.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.303
First of all, we do not use
that kind of language ever.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.439
And second of all,
Spain is not gonna be...

02:52.506 --> 02:53.940
Caca del toro.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.843
It is gonna be an adventure
and a learning experience.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.445
Do you understand me, son?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.116
Forgiveness is love, you know?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.586
What did I do?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.888
He's quoting your father now.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.489
It's unbelievable.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.759
Come on. Give it up.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.030
Ugh. That's gross. Aah!

03:17.098 --> 03:18.064
Yeah.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.399
You sorry?

03:19.467 --> 03:20.800
I guess.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.602
I just wanted you to play
for the Bobcats again.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.704
I know, Buddy. I'll tell you what.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.873
You know what I do when
I'm having a bad day?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.976
What? Go to the bar. Let's go.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.978
Sweet.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.015
It's open.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.053
Hey. Hey.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.959
I tried calling you. It
went straight to voicemail.

03:46.027 --> 03:49.596
Yeah. I, uh, kind of
threw my phone in the pool.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.135
I went by your office.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.838
I thought maybe your assistant
could help you somehow.

03:58.906 --> 03:59.973
It's okay.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.708
No, it's not okay.

04:01.776 --> 04:04.044
It sucks... turtle eggs.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.380
Turtle eggs?

04:07.448 --> 04:08.648
Really?

04:08.716 --> 04:11.117
I don't know. It sucks something.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.721
Anyway, she wanted me to tell you that,

04:14.789 --> 04:17.891
I guess, somebody got sick,
and it's really serious.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.892
Joe Turner's mom.

04:22.163 --> 04:23.697
What?

04:23.764 --> 04:24.965
Okay. I don't understand.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.399
Tell me again what's happening.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.667
Joe Turner's mom is sick.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.336
Okay, not so good for Joe Turner's mom,

04:29.403 --> 04:30.403
but what does that mean?

04:30.471 --> 04:31.738
It means you did it.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.540
I mean, well, you haven't
yet, but there's hope.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.008
Awesome. For what?

04:35.076 --> 04:37.077
Okay, Joe Turner is a center
for the Sacramento Kings,

04:37.144 --> 04:38.712
and he's from a little
town near Raleigh.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.547
Got it.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.681
I still don't get it.

04:41.749 --> 04:42.849
Okay, just get in. You will.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.050
Great. Where are we going?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.219
To a little town outside of Raleigh...

04:46.287 --> 04:48.154
And to buy me a new blackberry.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.090
Hey, by the way, thanks for this.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.358
You're welcome.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.194
I have no idea what
the hell is going on.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.329
Grubbs. How you doing, man?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.365
I want you to meet my son.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.267
I mean, my old college roommate, Jamie.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.869
How old are you, Jamie?

05:02.937 --> 05:05.005
24, right, Jame?

05:05.072 --> 05:07.674
Yep. I was 23 but I had a birthday.

05:07.742 --> 05:08.742
Uh-huh.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.977
And, uh, when was this birthday?

05:11.045 --> 05:15.682
June. Maybe. It changes sometimes.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.718
It's good enough for me.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.353
Welcome to Tric.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.955
Jamie, grubbs has this gift

05:22.023 --> 05:23.923
where he can guess what
everybody likes to drink.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.458
What do you say, grubbs?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.360
Whiskey...

05:27.428 --> 05:28.428
For your roommate.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.563
And for you...

05:30.631 --> 05:32.365
Beer.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.967
Root beer.

05:34.035 --> 05:35.402
Ice cold.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.637
Two cherries.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.572
Awesome. That's totally what I wanted.

05:41.142 --> 05:42.442
Cheers.

05:44.045 --> 05:47.414
Yes, sir. I can be there on Monday.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.315
Thank you so much.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.851
Okay. Bye.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.527
They want me to start on Monday.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.829
I know. I heard.

06:02.897 --> 06:04.664
Well, for what it's worth,

06:04.732 --> 06:07.033
I think that you are gonna do great.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.775
You know I love you.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.277
I love you, too.

06:17.344 --> 06:21.247
It's just...

06:21.315 --> 06:23.983
You never asked me to go with you,

06:24.051 --> 06:25.752
and that kind of hurt.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.387
So you'd have gone with me?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.522
'Cause, baby, if you want to go...

06:29.590 --> 06:32.325
Come to Los Angeles with me.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.426
Will you?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.395
No.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.830
Wait, but you just said that...

06:36.897 --> 06:37.831
no, I know.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.899
I can't.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.170
But it's nice to be asked.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.317
Hi.

07:03.057 --> 07:05.425
Hi.

07:05.493 --> 07:10.230
I can't believe I made it into heaven.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.268
I can't believe you put me through hell.

07:15.336 --> 07:17.837
I found you at your place.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.305
You called me.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.174
You came.

07:21.242 --> 07:23.476
Of course I came.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.613
That's what she said.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.454
You're lucky, you know that?

07:34.522 --> 07:35.955
You could've died,

07:36.023 --> 07:39.792
and there's nothing special
or romantic about that.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.662
You would have just been gone.

07:42.730 --> 07:46.499
You said...

07:46.567 --> 07:49.235
Nobody wanted me.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.407
Well, I was wrong.

07:54.475 --> 07:59.012
That's what I was
coming over to tell you,

07:59.079 --> 08:00.580
because...

08:02.917 --> 08:05.418
we got the financing for the movie.

08:05.486 --> 08:09.389
So you need to get better

08:09.456 --> 08:12.559
because we're not gonna
make it with anyone else.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.064
It's okay. Rest.

08:18.132 --> 08:20.700
I'll be here.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.780
I don't know, grubbs.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.984
It's like one day you're in school,

08:39.052 --> 08:41.219
and your world makes sense...

08:41.287 --> 08:45.257
friends, classes, recess.

08:45.325 --> 08:49.027
The next day... Spain.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.564
Bet they don't even
have recess in Spain.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.600
Siesta. They have siesta.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.338
Haley packed for her tour yet?

08:59.405 --> 09:01.273
We're still dealing with Spain.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.142
What's that?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.210
Champagne.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.545
I didn't order...  I know.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.613
It's just, uh, kind of a gift I have.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.248
I don't drink champagne.

09:11.951 --> 09:15.754
Right. Uh, I meant, uh,
White...  White wine.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.757
Dear God, no. Two
fingers of whiskey, neat.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.828
Off you go.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.331
So, moving to Spain, huh?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.999
Oh, yeah.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.201
I bet it's gonna suck.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.802
Oh, I don't know about that,

09:30.870 --> 09:32.304
what with all the child labor...

09:32.372 --> 09:35.006
Oh, and the fact that they
eat children as a delicacy.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.776
That was a joke.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.612
It's a wonderful place,
Spain. You'll see.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.047
I, um...

09:42.115 --> 09:46.318
I didn't know which
kind you wanted, so...

09:46.386 --> 09:48.620
Could you...

09:48.688 --> 09:50.889
I just...  I didn't know.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.929
So what's so great about it?

09:57.997 --> 10:00.465
You said Spain was a wonderful place,

10:00.533 --> 10:02.167
so what's so great about it?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.335
Hmm.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.007
La Tomatina.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.144
Hi, Joe.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.679
Clay Evans. I'm an agent with ISC.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.018
We got the flowers. Thanks.

10:20.086 --> 10:23.789
Well, uh, actually I'm
not with ISC anymore.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.123
They fired me.

10:25.191 --> 10:28.126
Tough break.

10:28.194 --> 10:32.130
Yeah. Those seem to be going around.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.932
How's your mom?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.102
She has cancer.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.272
I'm sorry.

10:40.339 --> 10:43.875
They say she has less than a year.

10:43.943 --> 10:47.279
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:47.346 --> 10:51.149
That's my moms, man. She's all I got.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.719
You ever lose anyone close to you?

10:54.787 --> 10:58.023
Yeah.

10:58.090 --> 11:02.327
How do you deal with
that, man? What do you do?

11:02.395 --> 11:05.697
You remember the good things...

11:05.765 --> 11:08.934
And the days that you did have.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.271
Joe, would it help you

11:13.339 --> 11:15.240
if you could play closer
to home next season?

11:19.011 --> 11:21.913
I stole a dress from Brooke...

11:21.981 --> 11:23.815
an expensive one.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.617
Of all the people to steal from,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.420
Brooke is the one who trusted
you and helped you the most.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.990
You got to talk to her.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.458
The truth.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.400
I remember looking in that mirror

11:42.468 --> 11:45.971
and telling you how special you are.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.574
How can you not see that?

11:49.642 --> 11:54.746
Marvin, when I look at that mirror,

11:54.814 --> 11:57.782
I just want to cut a
line on it and snort it.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.088
That's what I see.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.329
We have no further comment at this time.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.100
How's she doing?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.902
She's gonna be okay...

12:16.969 --> 12:21.006
as okay as anyone can be
after a suicide attempt.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.407
Uh, exhaustion.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.408
What?

12:23.476 --> 12:24.876
To the press.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.278
They don't know that you fired her,

12:26.345 --> 12:27.479
so we say it's exhaustion,

12:27.547 --> 12:28.947
they speculate, sell magazines...

12:29.015 --> 12:30.582
everybody's happy.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.484
Except Alex.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.819
I don't know, mom.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.054
She's a mess.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.790
Millie got arrested.
I'm fighting with Julian.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.259
At least it can't get any worse.

12:41.327 --> 12:45.130
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.765
Where's the red dress?

12:46.832 --> 12:48.466
That's a good question.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.436
And the answer is... Millicent stole it.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.105
Why would she steal from us?

12:54.173 --> 12:55.307
You should ask her that.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.949
I'm mad at you.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.719
You know what happens
when you die, Alex?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.623
You're dead.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.192
That's what happens.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.038
I was talking about pens.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.176
The last thing I said
to Sara before she died.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.613
She went to grab a drink,

13:34.680 --> 13:37.582
and I was babbling about
the pen I was using.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.986
And then she was gone.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.589
Sometimes I think
that we waste our words

13:44.657 --> 13:46.891
and we waste our moments

13:46.959 --> 13:48.693
and we don't take the
time to say the things

13:48.761 --> 13:51.196
that are in our hearts
when we have the chance.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.201
Sara knew you loved her.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.473
You told me you held her and you
danced with her before she died,

14:01.540 --> 14:07.312
and... I couldn't think of
a better way to say goodbye.

14:10.483 --> 14:14.252
How do you say goodbye?

14:18.491 --> 14:21.326
I know what some of you are thinking.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.895
That this is wrong.

14:23.963 --> 14:27.832
That it's cruel and insensitive

14:27.900 --> 14:29.801
and malicious towards
the families and memories

14:29.869 --> 14:34.773
of James Edwards and Keith Scott.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.408
Well, it is.

14:39.945 --> 14:45.050
There's a speech I'm supposed
to read, but I'm not going to...

14:47.520 --> 14:50.155
because this is my final show.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.758
And up until this
moment, nobody knew that.

14:53.826 --> 14:58.697
So, as I stand before you, live,
it's time to tell the truth.

14:58.764 --> 15:02.867
About me. About you.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.137
About life.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.506
So you might want to stick around...

15:10.810 --> 15:12.744
because, by the look on my wife's face,

15:12.812 --> 15:14.512
there's gonna be a few surprises.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.148
After this.

15:28.056 --> 15:29.723
Hey, you guys were really close

15:29.791 --> 15:31.559
to signing Derek McDaniel, right?

15:31.626 --> 15:32.827
Right, I thought so.

15:32.894 --> 15:35.629
Well, what if I told you
I could get him for you?

15:35.697 --> 15:38.065
You know the Bobcats
desperately need a center,

15:38.133 --> 15:39.767
and you know Joe's situation.

15:39.835 --> 15:41.769
I think i've got a way to make it work.

15:45.607 --> 15:48.342
I can't get inside.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.743
I know he's here. That's his car.

15:51.179 --> 15:53.013
You mean the one that
says "Bobcats G.M."

15:53.081 --> 15:54.148
On the license plate?

15:54.216 --> 15:55.216
You're good.

15:55.283 --> 15:56.417
Yeah. You're funny.

15:56.484 --> 15:57.985
And anyway, I'm not that good.

15:58.053 --> 15:59.386
He won't even take my calls,

15:59.454 --> 16:01.722
and without his okay, I
can't get inside to see him.

16:06.027 --> 16:08.729
Unless...

16:12.167 --> 16:13.834
You so owe me.

16:13.902 --> 16:16.203
I do. I do owe you.

16:19.574 --> 16:21.008
Oh, nice one.

16:21.076 --> 16:23.110
Jamie, move around this
time. Give us a moving target.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.081
Whoa! What is going on here?

16:27.148 --> 16:30.084
La tomatina. It's a
tomato fight in Spain.

16:30.151 --> 16:32.419
You said you needed
tomatoes for spaghetti sauce.

16:32.487 --> 16:33.754
What kind of grown men

16:33.822 --> 16:35.890
stand around and throw
tomatoes at a 7-year-old?

16:37.325 --> 16:38.959
You want to throw one, don't you?

16:39.027 --> 16:40.895
Yes, I do.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.467
Oh!

16:48.236 --> 16:49.637
It's so on.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.072
Aah! Take cover, Jamie!

16:57.879 --> 16:59.313
Hi, gene.

16:59.381 --> 17:01.282
I thought they fired you.

17:01.349 --> 17:02.549
They did.

17:02.617 --> 17:05.519
Well, you're tenacious.
I'll give you that.

17:05.587 --> 17:06.819
Impress me.

17:06.887 --> 17:09.256
What if I told you I
could get a proven big man

17:09.324 --> 17:11.224
that's about to become an all-star

17:11.292 --> 17:12.526
to waive his no-trade clause

17:12.594 --> 17:13.894
because he wants to come
play for the Bobcats?

17:13.962 --> 17:17.830
I'd say you're too late, Clay.

17:17.898 --> 17:20.267
Joe Turner's mom is sick.

17:20.335 --> 17:22.569
Joe Turner.

17:22.637 --> 17:25.506
She has cancer. They say she has a year.

17:25.573 --> 17:28.342
Joe wants to play close
to home next season.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.244
I think he'd make a
great long-term deal

17:30.312 --> 17:31.512
in order to do that.

17:31.579 --> 17:33.514
You guys wanted him
during the draft, gene.

17:33.581 --> 17:35.549
Joe Turner's a great player.

17:35.617 --> 17:37.952
But you know we signed Derek McDaniel.

17:38.019 --> 17:39.954
And you wanted a center...

17:40.021 --> 17:42.056
Which brings me to this.

17:42.123 --> 17:44.992
How do you feel about
trading Derek McDaniel?

17:50.565 --> 17:52.900
You're next. Go.

18:34.943 --> 18:36.710
Sacramento's already
agreed to a sign-and-trade.

18:36.778 --> 18:39.313
They finally get McDaniel,
you guys get Turner, and...

18:39.381 --> 18:40.314
hold on.

18:40.382 --> 18:42.850
What the hell is that?

19:02.437 --> 19:05.239
Wow.

19:54.522 --> 19:55.923
Yeah! Whoo!

19:58.326 --> 20:01.462
Sucks to be next!

20:16.177 --> 20:17.544
We all fail.

20:19.647 --> 20:22.950
Some of us have the fortitude
to pick ourselves up,

20:23.017 --> 20:26.954
and some of us will never have that.

20:27.021 --> 20:28.989
Some of us have Grace in our hearts

20:29.057 --> 20:31.325
and the ability to show compassion.

20:33.595 --> 20:34.928
And some of us don't.

20:40.268 --> 20:43.770
I'm a wealthy man, but let's face it...

20:43.838 --> 20:46.340
you shouldn't be able to
murder someone in cold blood

20:46.407 --> 20:49.710
and profit from it.

20:49.777 --> 20:55.182
So as of this moment,
I'm giving it all back.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.818
All of it.

20:57.886 --> 21:01.755
To charities and non-profits...

21:01.823 --> 21:04.725
and the people who deserve it...

21:04.792 --> 21:06.460
because I don't.

21:08.663 --> 21:11.231
Now it's time for me to go.

21:32.284 --> 21:35.120
I'm gonna miss this place.

21:35.187 --> 21:37.489
My first big show was right here.

21:37.556 --> 21:41.593
I like the bathrooms, too.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.297
I'm gonna miss it.

21:52.071 --> 21:54.172
I'll miss the stadiums.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.276
There's nothing like an
NBA arena on a game night.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.879
Boston. Madison Square garden.

22:00.946 --> 22:03.181
I'll miss that.

22:03.249 --> 22:06.484
What are you gonna miss, Jame?

22:06.552 --> 22:07.786
Grandpa Dan.

22:13.059 --> 22:16.594
I've talked a lot about forgiveness.

22:16.662 --> 22:18.663
As you can imagine,

22:18.731 --> 22:20.632
a man like me has to believe in it.

22:23.669 --> 22:26.304
But I don't.

22:26.372 --> 22:29.207
Forgiveness doesn't exist.

22:34.346 --> 22:38.316
There's simply what you
do... and how you pay for it.

22:38.384 --> 22:40.452
So remember that

22:40.519 --> 22:43.521
when you practice whatever
evil's in your heart...

22:43.589 --> 22:46.191
or when you cheat or
steal or lust or hate

22:46.258 --> 22:49.327
or gossip or covet or
whatever it is that you do

22:49.395 --> 22:53.298
or you're planning to
do or you have done.

22:53.365 --> 22:55.667
There is no forgiveness.

22:55.735 --> 23:00.538
There's just what comes next.

23:00.606 --> 23:04.442
Take it from someone who's
been there, who is there.

23:08.214 --> 23:11.449
There's only pain...

23:11.517 --> 23:14.252
and guilt...

23:14.320 --> 23:19.958
and the misery of knowing
who you are and what you did.

23:25.131 --> 23:27.632
So don't do it.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.602
Just stop... before it's too late.

23:47.553 --> 23:50.522
I miss you, big brother.

23:50.589 --> 23:53.591
Every second of every day.

23:58.864 --> 24:00.532
It's there.

24:04.036 --> 24:06.404
And that's all there is.

24:12.678 --> 24:16.047
You ready to sign some
contracts, Jameson?

24:16.115 --> 24:18.116
They'll be here soon.

24:18.184 --> 24:19.517
I guess.

24:39.104 --> 24:41.239
I know that playing overseas

24:41.307 --> 24:43.508
isn't what you hoped for, son.

24:43.576 --> 24:46.811
I just liked it when you
played for the Bobcats.

24:46.879 --> 24:48.680
Yeah, I did, too.

24:48.747 --> 24:52.851
But my agents did the best they could.

24:52.918 --> 24:55.687
So did Clay, but you fired him.

25:01.026 --> 25:03.494
What are you thinking?

25:03.562 --> 25:06.464
You know how you're afraid of the ocean?

25:06.532 --> 25:08.433
And the reason you gave me?

25:08.500 --> 25:12.403
Immensity...  because it's so immense.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.839
Well, I was thinking...

25:16.942 --> 25:19.310
the ocean's not so immense.

25:19.378 --> 25:20.845
Life is immense.

25:20.913 --> 25:24.716
But we bravely go into it every day...

25:24.783 --> 25:27.285
Just like you did today.

25:32.024 --> 25:34.592
You know, I might need an
agent if I make the squad.

25:35.961 --> 25:38.463
You're a terrible dancer.

25:38.530 --> 25:39.597
That's not fair.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.299
It's a turn-on, actually. Oh, yeah.

25:41.367 --> 25:42.867
It worked for me for some reason.

25:48.374 --> 25:52.043
This all seems pretty selfish.

25:52.111 --> 25:54.812
You go out and walk these halls,

25:54.880 --> 25:59.317
and you will see people
fighting for another day of life.

25:59.385 --> 26:00.618
Another hour.

26:00.686 --> 26:02.520
Another minute.

26:05.024 --> 26:06.891
I don't know, Alex.

26:06.959 --> 26:11.462
This all feels pretty selfish to me.

26:11.530 --> 26:15.466
Is she gonna be okay?

26:15.534 --> 26:17.635
She's gonna live.

26:17.703 --> 26:20.405
It's debatable with you.

26:26.145 --> 26:30.081
I'm sorry.

26:30.149 --> 26:32.784
I said terrible things to Alex

26:32.851 --> 26:38.189
and I stole the dress from
you and I'm just sorry.

26:38.257 --> 26:42.493
Why, Millie? What happened to you?

26:42.561 --> 26:44.762
I was trying to lose weight...

26:44.830 --> 26:47.899
And I was trying to look
like the other girls,

26:47.967 --> 26:51.502
and it was just there
in Alex's closet, and...

26:51.570 --> 26:54.105
Drugs.

26:55.975 --> 26:57.675
Cocaine.

27:03.015 --> 27:05.216
Okay.

27:07.987 --> 27:10.688
You're not my model anymore.

27:10.756 --> 27:14.726
But you're still my friend.

27:14.793 --> 27:17.662
Just go get some help.

27:25.004 --> 27:27.972
I'm proud of you for
getting help, Millie.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.542
I wish there was more I could do.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.745
Maybe I could stay.

27:33.812 --> 27:36.981
You can't.

27:37.049 --> 27:39.283
I have to do it alone.

27:39.351 --> 27:43.054
But we were pretty good together, huh?

27:43.122 --> 27:45.356
We were great together.

27:45.424 --> 27:46.891
It's just...

27:46.959 --> 27:49.327
Sometimes, people don't make it.

27:51.797 --> 27:54.565
I'm gonna miss you.

27:54.633 --> 27:56.267
Me too.

28:05.010 --> 28:07.912
I will always be there
for you, sweet girl.

28:35.074 --> 28:38.042
That's not a very good
shooting percentage.

28:41.914 --> 28:43.614
Hi.

28:55.194 --> 28:57.962
I came here to tell you two things.

28:58.030 --> 29:00.965
The first is that I love you

29:01.033 --> 29:03.701
and I miss you and I
want to be with you.

29:03.769 --> 29:07.071
And the second is...

29:07.139 --> 29:09.674
I'm gonna make that movie with Alex.

29:18.083 --> 29:21.085
When did you meet Peyton?

29:23.722 --> 29:25.723
In L.A. You know that.

29:25.791 --> 29:29.026
No. Specifically, the
moment you met her.

29:29.094 --> 29:32.296
She had just broken up with Lucas,

29:32.364 --> 29:35.199
and she was crying in the
copy room of a record label.

29:35.267 --> 29:37.502
And when did we start being us?

29:37.569 --> 29:41.305
You needed help with Sam.

29:41.373 --> 29:42.907
And now Alex.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.950
My mom used to be the
most amazing woman.

29:53.018 --> 29:56.254
She had this magic inside her.

29:56.321 --> 30:02.660
And after a while, she
felt unloved or unworthy.

30:02.728 --> 30:04.228
I don't know.

30:04.296 --> 30:08.266
My dad was always working,
and I was just a kid.

30:08.333 --> 30:12.103
I was always gone, just
doing whatever kids do.

30:15.240 --> 30:20.178
No one reminded her how special she was.

30:20.245 --> 30:23.080
No one tried to stop her
when she took that extra drink

30:23.148 --> 30:25.283
or those extra pills.

30:25.350 --> 30:29.187
And...

30:29.254 --> 30:34.158
Eventually, her fire burned out.

30:34.226 --> 30:38.196
And she became the
not-so-special person

30:38.263 --> 30:40.331
she thought she was all along.

30:45.103 --> 30:50.508
Julian, you can't fix
your mom by fixing Alex.

30:55.414 --> 31:02.753
But maybe I can help her
before her fire burns out.

31:02.821 --> 31:07.325
And if not... at least I tried.

31:23.980 --> 31:27.149
Nathan, you're about to
be $7 million wealthier.

31:27.217 --> 31:29.151
And we couldn't be happier.

31:32.989 --> 31:34.122
Uncle Clay.

31:34.190 --> 31:37.893
What's up, Buddy? Oh, man, I missed you.

31:37.961 --> 31:40.462
Not as much as your
aunt Quinn missed you.

31:40.530 --> 31:41.830
Something we can do for you, Clay?

31:41.898 --> 31:42.998
You? No.

31:43.066 --> 31:45.834
But there is something
I can do for Nathan.

31:45.902 --> 31:47.236
We don't have time for this.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.244
Sure we do.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.581
Nate, I never said this to you or Haley,

31:59.649 --> 32:03.318
but I was aggressive and
arrogant negotiating your deal,

32:03.386 --> 32:07.356
and along the way, I
forgot that I work for you.

32:07.423 --> 32:09.858
And the client comes first.

32:09.926 --> 32:11.827
Now, it sounds like my former agency

32:11.894 --> 32:14.162
got you a pretty good
deal to play overseas,

32:14.230 --> 32:17.532
but I always thought
of you as an NBA player.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.268
And that was always the dream.

32:19.335 --> 32:20.302
Right, Jamie?

32:20.370 --> 32:21.403
Right.

32:21.471 --> 32:23.772
'Cause Spain is caca del toro.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.240
So this morning,

32:25.308 --> 32:28.176
I negotiated you a deal
to live that dream...

32:28.244 --> 32:30.846
in the NBA... with the Sacramento Kings.

32:30.913 --> 32:35.350
Nathan, we have a good deal here.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.685
That's true.

32:36.753 --> 32:40.956
You know, $7 million is a
good deal to play overseas.

32:41.024 --> 32:43.725
Or you could take $15
million from the Kings.

32:45.028 --> 32:47.329
Now, the deal does come
with a few conditions.

32:47.397 --> 32:48.730
Three, actually.

32:48.798 --> 32:52.267
One, you have to leave
ISC and sign with me.

32:52.335 --> 32:54.403
You'll be my second client.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.738
Two, your deal comes
with a no-trade clause.

32:56.806 --> 32:58.340
Gonna need you to waive that...

32:58.408 --> 33:00.309
Because if you sign with the Kings...

33:00.376 --> 33:02.511
they've agreed to trade
you and Joe Turner tonight!

33:04.647 --> 33:06.815
I'm sorry. I love that part.

33:06.883 --> 33:10.819
They've agreed to trade
you and Joe Turner...

33:10.887 --> 33:13.288
to the Charlotte Bobcats.

33:13.356 --> 33:17.025
What? Oh, my God!

33:17.093 --> 33:20.896
Oh, my...

33:20.963 --> 33:22.898
you're gonna be a Bobcat!

33:22.965 --> 33:25.067
Oh, I threw my jersey away.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.506
Clay, how did this happen?

33:31.574 --> 33:34.076
With a lot of help from Quinn...

33:34.143 --> 33:37.546
Which brings me to my last condition.

33:37.613 --> 33:39.381
I want to be your agent, Nate,

33:39.449 --> 33:41.283
but if you're gonna sign with me,

33:41.351 --> 33:44.019
you need to know that I
plan on falling completely

33:44.087 --> 33:45.754
and insanely in love with Quinn.

33:49.092 --> 33:51.193
All right.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.796
I got to go to work.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.754
I got to go. Yeah.

35:01.764 --> 35:03.799
This doesn't mean that I don't love you.

35:03.866 --> 35:06.868
It's okay.

35:06.936 --> 35:09.604
'Cause I do love you, Lauren...

35:09.672 --> 35:11.306
And I always will.

35:11.374 --> 35:14.476
I love you, too.

35:23.719 --> 35:25.720
So you're telling me
there's nothing left.

35:25.788 --> 35:26.788
He gave it all away.

35:26.856 --> 35:28.690
He did leave you this.

35:31.027 --> 35:33.061
Divorce papers.

35:33.129 --> 35:36.431
Well, that's gonna cost him.

35:36.499 --> 35:38.467
Cost him what? There's nothing left.

36:03.826 --> 36:06.561
Nathan.

36:06.629 --> 36:10.165
I heard about the show.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.370
I'm gonna re-sign with the Bobcats.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.909
Well, thank you for
helping me get there.

36:22.411 --> 36:26.114
Your grandson wants to say goodbye.

36:29.919 --> 36:32.721
Are you leaving, grandpa Dan?

36:32.788 --> 36:35.390
I have to.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.926
Why?

36:44.166 --> 36:47.536
I've done a lot of bad things, Jamie.

36:47.603 --> 36:48.870
And I'm sorry.

36:51.541 --> 36:54.409
It's okay. I forgive you.

38:06.415 --> 38:09.484
Can you guys tell us how
this all happened so fast?

38:09.552 --> 38:12.320
Well...

38:12.388 --> 38:15.991
We have a really, really good agent.

38:21.697 --> 38:22.998
Hey!

38:26.135 --> 38:28.570
What are you doing?

38:28.638 --> 38:30.905
Facing the immensity, I guess.

38:33.409 --> 38:35.043
I'll come in.

38:35.111 --> 38:36.511
No.

38:39.382 --> 38:41.883
I'll come out.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.272
Did you mean what you said?

39:04.340 --> 39:07.108
About falling in love with me?

39:07.176 --> 39:09.411
Insanely in love.

39:09.478 --> 39:10.412
Yeah.

39:53.222 --> 39:55.724
I'm sorry.

39:57.593 --> 40:00.295
I know.

40:00.362 --> 40:03.164
But I need you to understand something.

40:03.232 --> 40:06.835
If you ever try this again...

40:06.902 --> 40:08.903
I'll never forgive you.

40:08.971 --> 40:13.242
I won't miss you. I
won't think of you at all.

40:14.877 --> 40:18.346
So promise me you won't.

40:18.414 --> 40:22.317
I promise.

40:28.891 --> 40:30.458
Okay.

40:30.526 --> 40:32.927
Let's make our movie.

41:00.756 --> 41:02.824
I'm sorry. We're closed.

41:02.892 --> 41:04.292
I know.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.227
I'm Alexander Coyne.

41:07.963 --> 41:12.667
I guess Victoria didn't tell you.

41:12.735 --> 41:14.602
She hired me for your men's line.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.642
I'm your new designer.
