00:03.090 --> 00:05.353
You guys really go all out
into holidays, huh?

00:05.440 --> 00:07.007
Yes, we do.
And save your air.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.357
'cause you still have to blow up
an eight foot snowman.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.534
And do that inside of the house.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.101
I did it on the front lawn
last year

00:14.188 --> 00:16.277
and we got a lot of calls
from the neighbors.

00:18.235 --> 00:22.109
It's not your fault they put
his little nozzle in the front.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.198
And now that we have a man
that can get up on the roof

00:24.285 --> 00:25.982
with Christmas lights
and a nail gun

00:26.069 --> 00:27.766
we are gonna pimp
this bitch out.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.075
Should I try and untangle these,
or you just want to drop them

00:32.162 --> 00:34.599
from the roof on New Year's Eve?

00:34.686 --> 00:37.428
Oh, no, for New Year's Eve we do
Roman candles and air horns.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.387
Oh, God, the neighbors hate us.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.043
Oh. Oh, look, stockings.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.957
[together]
Aww.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.568
We got to hang
one up for Mike, too.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.657
Do you still have yours
from when you were a kid?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.485
Oh, mom didn't really
save a lot of that stuff.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.834
And truthfully, Christmas wasn't

00:51.921 --> 00:53.096
really a big deal
around our house.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.837
But you still celebrated,
didn't you?

00:54.924 --> 00:56.230
Sure, when my dad was around

00:56.317 --> 00:58.232
we'd have a very
traditional Christmas.

00:58.319 --> 01:00.103
He'd get a tree,
we'd exchange gifts

01:00.190 --> 01:01.626
my mom would call him cheap
and start a fight

01:01.713 --> 01:03.585
he'd take a bottle of booze
into the backyard

01:03.672 --> 01:05.152
I'd cry and we'd go to bed.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.461
Oh, my God,
was it like that every year?

01:10.548 --> 01:12.420
Oh, after he moved out
it got kind of sad.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.859
Mom and I would have
our Christmas dinners at Denny's

01:16.946 --> 01:19.905
and then go over to Daley Plaza
and watch the ice skaters fall.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.212
Ah, how she loved
to watch 'em fall.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.652
Well, we're gonna get rid
of the ghosts of Christmas Past

01:27.739 --> 01:28.871
and make you some new memories,
right, girls?

01:28.958 --> 01:30.525
- Right.
- You betcha.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.440
Tomorrow we're gonna go
pick out a Christmas tree

01:32.527 --> 01:35.573
and pop some popcorn
and string some cranberries.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.401
- Apple cider.
- With schnapps.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.926
- Hot cocoa.
- With schnapps.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.407
The house'll be smelling like
gingerbread and sugar cookies.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.366
And schnapps.

- You bet it does.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.199
So strap on your elf hat, buddy

01:52.286 --> 01:53.896
'cause Santa Claus
is coming to town.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.332
And that twinkly-eyed rascal

01:55.419 --> 01:57.856

with the Flynn girls.

01:57.943 --> 02:02.078

if you've been naughty or nice.

Okay.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.928
- Who else wants schnapps?
- I do.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.539

about Christmas break

there was no homework.

for the deluxe one.

and a tiny shirt.

are singing pretty songs

my best and be a good person

09:57.074 --> 09:59.120
That's why we get
free pumpkins at Halloween

09:59.207 --> 10:00.774
stuffed bunnies on Easter

10:00.861 --> 10:03.211
and crack cocaine
pretty much year round.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.826
[Mike]
'There she is,
my Christmas angel.'

10:09.913 --> 10:11.915
And you're just in time
to help decorate the tree.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.569
Whoo!

10:15.136 --> 10:18.052
Let's decorate
the hell out of that thing!

10:18.139 --> 10:19.488
Whoo!

10:21.708 --> 10:24.754
Whoo! Let's throw
some tinsel on it.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.409
And pretend
that it's not already dead.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.541
Whoo-oo-oo!

10:32.849 --> 10:35.156
Look at the little dead tree.

10:35.243 --> 10:39.116
See you in about two weeks
when you're rottin' on the curb.

10:42.554 --> 10:46.080
Whoo. And to all a goodnight.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.481
Anybody want schnapps?

10:56.568 --> 10:58.483
[instrumental music]

11:02.487 --> 11:03.793
[instrumental music]

11:05.534 --> 11:08.406
Molly? Sweetie, you awake?
It's time for lunch.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.887
- Not hungry.
- Come on, rise and shine.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.672
You've been under those covers
for two days now.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.064
Let's see that pretty
little face of yours...

11:14.151 --> 11:15.587
Whoa.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.895
- What?
- Nothin'.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.375
I just thought
it might be kind of fun

11:20.462 --> 11:21.593
to get out of the house today.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.291
Take a shower, brush our teeth

11:23.378 --> 11:25.162
maybe buy some gifts
for our loved ones.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.598
Just put my purse under the tree

11:26.686 --> 11:29.253
and tell everyone
to take what they want.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.299
Come on, you don't need
that vice-principal job.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.909
You're still a great teacher.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.390
Was a great teacher.
I'm done with that.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.739
What are you talkin' about?

11:37.566 --> 11:38.959
What is the point?

11:39.046 --> 11:41.613
I'm nothing,
but a glorified baby sitter.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.356
I'd actually make more money
if I was a baby sitter.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.229
Hey, why don't we try to salvage
what's left of the day?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.753
I'll go rustle us up some lunch
and you make yourself pretty.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.192
Not that you're not
pretty already.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.325
Prettier is what I meant.

11:57.412 --> 12:00.328
- If that's possible.
- Get out!

12:00.415 --> 12:02.504
[instrumental music]

12:05.072 --> 12:07.161
Well, who is this pretty
little thing, Jingles?

12:07.248 --> 12:08.771
[high-pitched voice]
This is Cindy.

12:08.858 --> 12:12.079
And according to your list,
she's been a very good girl.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.385
- Is that true, young lady?
- Yes.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.691
Well, let's see
if we can find

12:15.778 --> 12:18.128
an extra special present
for you.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.261
I'm on it, Santy Claus.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.437
Ooh!

12:22.524 --> 12:24.744
This feels like a dolly.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.050
But don't open it
until Christmas morning

12:27.137 --> 12:30.184
even though Jingles here already
ruined the surprise for you.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.230
Make sure
you give her a good home

12:33.317 --> 12:34.710
and don't ever let her
quit school, do drugs

12:34.797 --> 12:37.321
or get a tramp stamp.

12:37.408 --> 12:41.108
You just make the toys, Jingles,
don't tell 'em how to raise 'em.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.196
Thank you, Santa.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.285
You're welcome, little princess.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.982
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.592
Santa needs to take five.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.682
Yeah, I can see
how you might get tired

12:50.770 --> 12:54.295
sitting on that throne while
I lift children onto your lap.

12:54.382 --> 12:57.907
Santa needs to take a little
"Pause for the Claus."

13:04.087 --> 13:06.046
So when we're done here
you want to grab a bite to eat?

13:06.133 --> 13:08.178
If we stay in costume,
we might get a free dessert.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.919
Mmm, says the man
who's not trying to hide

13:10.006 --> 13:12.400
his Christmas package
under a short elf shirt.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.403
What's the matter,
Molly still hasn't pulled out

13:15.490 --> 13:17.013
of her funk yet?

13:17.100 --> 13:20.060
- Hey, when are you coming back?
- Be cool, little man.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.106
Santa has a domestic situation
up at the North Pole.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.412
I'm sure
she'll pull out of it.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.022
You just need
to give her a little space.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.372
I hope so 'cause I've never
really had a good Christmas.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.940
and I'm starting to think
maybe mom's right.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.334
It is me.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.901
I just want my toy.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.293
If you don't mind
your manners, you're not

13:36.380 --> 13:37.773
gonna get a toy this year.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.210
You're not real.
Elves aren't black.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.691
Hey, there are black elves
all over the North Pole.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.171
How many times you been?

13:45.389 --> 13:47.261
None? That's what I thought.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.089
Carl, let it go.
He's just a kid.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.396
And you're not really Santa.
Santa's not that fat.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.181
You know how I got this fat?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.444
By eating
all the little naughty kids.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.012
So butter up and I'll see you
Christmas mornin'.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.192
Why does this happen every year?

14:05.279 --> 14:07.150
I don't know.
I-I blame the parents.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.459
[music on television]

14:19.771 --> 14:21.904
How do you drink that eggnog
without booze in it?

14:21.991 --> 14:24.820
Basically, you're just
guzzlin' pancake batter.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.825
Who said there's no booze in it?

14:34.221 --> 14:36.179
Charlie Brown's a chump.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.182
Whoa! Charlie Brown
is a beloved character.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.663
And this is a timeless
holiday classic.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.317
Look at those little jerks.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.928
They all have the same giant
heads, just different hair.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.498
Much like the Moranto family.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.457
Men, women, babies.
All got the same melon.

14:53.544 --> 14:56.199
You think you're gonna grow
into it, nobody ever does.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.942
I can't believe they keep
shovin' this baloney

15:00.029 --> 15:02.075
down our throats every year.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.424
Oh, come on.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.295
You're tellin' me
your heart doesn't swell

15:05.382 --> 15:08.081
when the little gay kid
tells the bald-headed bastard

15:08.168 --> 15:10.953
about the true meaning
of Christmas?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.824
If this were real life

15:12.912 --> 15:15.827
Charlie Brown would've tied
Linus' blanket around his neck

15:15.915 --> 15:19.527
like a noose and jumped off
the top of Snoopy's doghouse.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.748
Wow, you are grim.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.621
[doorbell dings]

15:26.708 --> 15:28.579
You've got a big melon head.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.321
Please let it be carolers.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.671
I'm dying to turn the hose
on some carolers.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.849
- Miss Flynn?
- Who's askin'?

15:40.461 --> 15:41.766
My name's Matt Dalton.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.246
I was a student of yours
about ten years ago.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.118
Okay.
Well, thanks for stopping by.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.207
- Don't be a stranger.
- But wait, wait, wait..

15:49.122 --> 15:50.253
You don't remember me?

15:50.340 --> 15:51.646
I was kind of fidgety.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.082
I spent most of my time
drawing in my notebook

15:53.169 --> 15:56.564
and on my desk
and on the walls.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.740
Look, Matt, I'm sure you think
you're narrowing it down

15:58.827 --> 16:01.917
but I've seen a lot
of Ritalin kids in my day.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.704
Do you remember
when you walked by me

16:06.791 --> 16:08.968
and I'd drawn
this big dragon on my desk?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.317
And instead of getting
mad, you gave me

16:10.404 --> 16:11.883
a sheet of drawing paper
and told me to make it

16:11.971 --> 16:14.016
bigger, more colorful?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.975
And I hung it on the board.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.541
You did.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.371
Matt Dalton.

16:21.458 --> 16:25.201
I do remember you.
That was a dragon?

16:25.288 --> 16:27.421
All these years
I thought it was a dog.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.423
I mean, a beautiful dog.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.860
Very colorful.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.470
Well, you were the only teacher
that encouraged me

16:33.557 --> 16:35.037
to pursue my drawing.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.387
So I wanted to come by
and thank you.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.780
And to tell you I got accepted

16:38.867 --> 16:41.304
into
the School of Art and Design.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.003
Really? That's great.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.223
It was because of you.

16:47.310 --> 16:50.357
Well...wow.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.533
Do you...do you want
to come in for a bit

16:52.620 --> 16:55.449
and maybe have, um, some eggnog?

16:57.494 --> 16:59.366
Don't worry, he's nobody.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.025
I gotta get going, but, um..

17:08.679 --> 17:10.899
I wanted to give you this.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.379
Hey.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.165
Aw.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.951
Hang on to it.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.910
Hopefully, it'll be
worth something someday.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.348
It already is.

17:25.435 --> 17:28.221
Thanks, Miss Flynn.
Merry Christmas.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.918
Merry Christmas, Matt.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.841
I'm sorry,
but this is totally a dog.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.026
[instrumental music]

17:53.072 --> 17:54.986
[indistinct chatter]

17:56.510 --> 17:58.860
Hey. Look, everybody,
Santa's here.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.297
- You're up.
- I am.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.908
- And dressed.
- And clean.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.607
So, all's well in Whoville?

18:06.694 --> 18:09.479
Yeah, I didn't want
to be vice-principal anyway.

18:09.566 --> 18:13.222
All they really do is push paper
and punish kids. And..

18:13.309 --> 18:15.442
I'd rather teach them
and inspire them.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.922
I thought you said there was
a significant pay bump, too.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.794
Vince.

18:19.881 --> 18:20.925
I don't care about the money.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.579
It's-it's not about that.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.581
It's about, you know,
doing something you love

18:24.668 --> 18:26.279
that you're passionate about.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.499
And being able to come home
to someone who loves you

18:29.586 --> 18:30.892
for who you are.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.850
And that ain't going anywhere.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.162
Aw, you're my big weenie truck.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.384
I don't know what that means,
but I'll take it.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.562
[instrumental music]

18:55.873 --> 18:58.615
