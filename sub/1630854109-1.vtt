WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:06.340
Previously...

00:06.440 --> 00:07.875
DUCKY:
The Raven and his followers

00:07.975 --> 00:09.677
went to great lengths
to poison half the city.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.945
And now, it appears
he blames you

00:12.046 --> 00:13.247
for stopping the attack.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.848
TORRES:
Hawai'i's in the building.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.751
Ah, here's another Parker
convict who's filing an appeal.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.153
Herman Maxwell.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.190
Maxwell is the Raven.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.791
Where is
Maxwell's plane?

00:26.727 --> 00:30.964
PILOT:
Kalaeloa Ground,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.601
Alpha 945
declaring an emergency.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.169
Need medical assistance.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.137
Alpha 945.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.171
Hold your position. Acknowledge.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.740
Kalaeloa Ground, Alpha 945

00:39.840 --> 00:41.242
requesting taxi to hangar.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.244
Alpha 945. Hold your position.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.846
Emergency vehicles
en route to you.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.616
(sirens wailing)

01:05.666 --> 01:08.569
Gonna need your license
and registration.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.538
Really?
KAI: No, sir.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.574
We do need you to open the
main cabin door and let us in.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.044
You don't want me to do that.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.997
Three clear.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.001
(meter beeps, trills)

01:41.101 --> 01:43.604
The air is clean.

01:43.704 --> 01:44.938
You sure?

01:45.038 --> 01:47.141
Yeah, check for yourself.
Plus, the pilot

01:47.241 --> 01:49.243
seems unaffected.
Okay.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.613
But for safety,
you take your mask off first.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.983
Just kidding, bud.

02:00.087 --> 02:03.424
Passengers got dosed
with something.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.160
Probably these.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.962
Poisoned drink,
just like back in D.C.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.064
I mean, it fits Maxwell's MO.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.634
Yeah, you know what
else fits his MO?

02:13.734 --> 02:14.768
He's not here.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.404
(knock on door)

02:16.504 --> 02:18.372
PILOT:
Hey, can I come out yet?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.574
Hey, get the pilot out of here.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.942
Check his vitals,

02:22.042 --> 02:23.177
and then bring him back to Pearl
for questioning.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.512
AGENT:
Yes, sir.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.252
This guy tricks us into
believing he's coming to Oahu,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.153
while he could be anywhere
in the world right now.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.556
(cell phone chimes)

02:39.627 --> 02:41.662
Aloha, NCIS.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.997
Sorry I couldn't be there
for the welcoming committee.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.133
My schedule's
kind of packed today.

02:46.234 --> 02:49.169
But I'm sure I'll see you soon.

02:56.777 --> 03:01.549
* *

03:15.263 --> 03:19.132
(vocalizes)
Morning, sleepyhead.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.003
What is all this?

03:23.103 --> 03:24.705
LUCY:
Breakfast in bed.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.039
Duh.
Yeah, I can

03:26.139 --> 03:27.207
see that. There's just...

03:27.308 --> 03:28.842
there's so...

03:28.942 --> 03:31.479
much of it.
Mm-hmm.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.047
Well, you're always doing
nice things for me.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.850
Making meals,
running errands,

03:36.950 --> 03:39.287
giving me financial advice.
Well, there was

03:39.387 --> 03:41.755
no way I was gonna let you pay
for that extended warranty.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.659
(laughs) I just wanted
to show my appreciation.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.162
You know this is way more than
either one of us can eat, right?

03:49.263 --> 03:51.332
You know that I am from Texas.
(laughs)

03:51.432 --> 03:53.867
Okay. No. That can't be
your response to everything.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.936
(laughs)

03:56.036 --> 03:57.170
Did I go too far?

03:57.271 --> 03:58.839
Way too far.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.643
And I love it.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.879
Domestic Lucy is hot.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.453
(cell phones buzzing)
Yours or mine?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.755
I think both of ours.
(groans)

04:14.855 --> 04:16.790
(sighs)
Uh...

04:16.890 --> 04:19.693
Herman Maxwell's plane
just landed at Kalaeloa.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.562
The Raven is here?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.997
Means all hands on deck.
(timer dings)

04:24.097 --> 04:25.433
Okay,
I'll get dressed.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.901
And I will get the
biscuits out of the oven.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.138
Wow.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.174
(elevator bell dings)

04:36.644 --> 04:37.978
You made it.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.748
Barely. 12 hours
in a C-130.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.116
Grateful for the Navy,
but you'd think they'd offer

04:43.216 --> 04:44.985
some kind of snack.
I'm starving.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.720
Homemade biscuit?
Ooh.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.921
Where's Knight?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.289
Assisting Jesse and Kai.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.458
Look, what do we know
about the plane?

04:50.558 --> 04:53.427
Dead passengers
flew under aliases.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.062
All members
of The Unkindness.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.630
That really what they
call themselves?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.166
It's a Poe reference.
Maxwell stays on theme.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.668
Trust us. It tracks.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.670
What did the pilot say?
LUCY: Not much.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.705
He was hired last-minute
to fly here,

05:04.805 --> 05:08.308
and he submitted the manifest
with Maxwell's name on it.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.010
Didn't think anything
out of the ordinary.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.347
Until passengers died violently
halfway over the Pacific Ocean.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.916
Yeah, uh-huh, until that.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.418
Look, Maxwell keeps playing us.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.553
He wants us to know
exactly where he is.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.654
He recorded
the video

05:20.754 --> 05:22.823
an hour before
the plane landed,

05:22.923 --> 05:24.191
in the heart of Waikiki.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.527
Okay, well,
that's where we go now.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.934
What gives?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.636
He's not gonna
be there, Nick.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.871
So what do we do? Just
stay here and suck our thumbs?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.407
No. We're gonna try
to figure out his next move.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.475
'Cause that worked
so well last time.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.343
We have to act fast.
We got to flood the streets.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.445
We got to find him.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.613
We have to act smart.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.715
We have to review the evidence,

05:47.815 --> 05:49.349
and we have to come up
with a plan.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.552
He wants us
to know he's here.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.388
He's expecting us
to go hard.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.591
Okay. So what, then?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.327
Maxwell managed
to escape prison,

06:00.428 --> 06:01.729
evade both NCIS

06:01.829 --> 06:05.098
and the FBI,
all to get him to Hawai'i.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.266
He's got to have a reason.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.035
RIMPAC.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.971
Rim of the Pacific
Exercise.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.841
World's premiere maritime
joint exercise. 26 nations.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.643
Creates a unique
training opportunity,

06:15.743 --> 06:17.377
promotes maritime security.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.680
Prime target for a terrorist
like Maxwell

06:19.780 --> 06:21.615
who's tried to attack
the military in the past.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.884
Lots of media attention.
Big bang for his buck.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.986
Lucy, you and Ernie
fill in the rest of the team

06:26.086 --> 06:27.354
on Maxwell's followers.
We might not be able

06:27.455 --> 06:28.422
to track his movements, but...

06:28.522 --> 06:29.523
We'll have better luck

06:29.623 --> 06:30.991
with the Uncaring.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.761
The Unkindness.
LUCY:
Whatever they're called.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.329
Hey, Tennant,
you have a sec?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.098
Talk fast.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.868
Look, I appreciate
your position on this.
Thanks.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.704
Uh, you're the boss,
and this is your turf.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.905
Agreed.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.540
And I certainly don't want
our relationship

06:46.640 --> 06:49.009
to get in the...
Because there isn't one.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.912
Because there isn't one.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.583
Although I'd argue
that we are friends.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.017
Are you getting close
to a point?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.252
It was my team leader
that Maxwell targeted.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.590
It was my people
that he tried to kill.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.926
You got skin in the game.
I get it.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.896
I won't make a play
without you knowing it.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.033
Except this one.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.904
(clears throat) That's fair.
Good talk.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.177
Commander Chase, how you doing?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.647
Well, better than
these poor souls.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.449
Sucking down a bottle full
of poison is a nasty way to go.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.953
I would say it's maybe
the 17th worst way to go.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.187
Special Agent
Jesse Boone,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.289
meet ME Dr. Jimmy Palmer.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.991
Jimmy Palmer.
Name sounds familiar.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.493
Yeah, I'm one of the folks
that inhaled

07:39.593 --> 07:41.629
The Raven's biotoxin here at HQ.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.230
No, that's not ringing a bell.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.632
Maybe you heard about the time

07:44.732 --> 07:47.134
where I helped jury-rig
a body to explode?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.769
Nope, but that sounds dope.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.105
Oh, you're the guy
who Ernie thought might be...

07:55.075 --> 07:57.745
No, it was the first thing
you said, about the, uh, poison.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.847
Kind of feels like you were
gonna say something else.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.181
No, definitely
it was the poison.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.950
Okay, gentlemen.
Three victims.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.285
Mysterious toxin.
Madman fugitive on the loose.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.654
Right. As I was just
saying to Dr. Chase,

08:06.754 --> 08:08.188
we don't know much
about the biotoxin

08:08.288 --> 08:09.790
that Maxwell
dosed us with,

08:09.890 --> 08:11.224
but it's definitely
different

08:11.324 --> 08:12.459
than the nerve agent
you're dealing with.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.194
And I suggested
it could be VX,

08:14.294 --> 08:15.696
since we know it responds
to atropine.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.897
And that's when I said

08:16.997 --> 08:18.566
that VX evaporates
too slowly.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.133
It doesn't create
the kind of

08:20.233 --> 08:22.335
vapor that you would've been
dealing with on that plane,

08:22.435 --> 08:23.937
and then I made this
little vapor pun.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
It was funny.
(laughs)
Guys.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.041
I don't need the blow-by-blow.
Maybe bottom-line it?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.811
We're dealing with soman.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.815
Maybe a little blow-by-blow.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.416
Uh, soman
was developed

08:36.516 --> 08:38.285
by Germany as a pesticide
during World War II.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.121
Similar to organophosphates,
but much more potent.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.489
And it's highly volatile.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.925
Even a fraction of an ounce
on your skin

08:45.025 --> 08:46.126
can be fatal.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.260
So, all you'd need
is about a pint

08:47.360 --> 08:48.696
to cause mass casualties.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.298
How hard is it
to come by?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.000
Uh, well, for you and me,
impossible,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.535
but for someone as versed in
the dark web as your suspect...

08:55.636 --> 08:57.671
We got to find this guy,

08:57.771 --> 09:00.007
make sure he doesn't use it.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.975
Oh, yeah.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.878
That is amazing.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.146
Am I right?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.982
32 points of individual
ergonomic adjustment.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.418
It's like I never really
knew how to sit before.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.920
I engineered it
myself.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.022
Uh, but I could
make one for you

09:15.122 --> 09:18.125
and... any new friends
you might have.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.330
I'm happy for you.
You deserve bliss.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.998
Well, thank you very much,

09:25.098 --> 09:27.334
but maybe now is not the time
or place to talk about this.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.637
I second that thought,

09:29.737 --> 09:31.304
and I'm, uh,
I'm wondering if we could

09:31.404 --> 09:32.572
just pivot back to tracing

09:32.673 --> 09:34.541
the IP address
of Maxwell's video.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.112
I already did.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.550
The video was filmed
on a burner phone,

09:43.651 --> 09:45.252
but it was bounced back
to an originating server

09:45.352 --> 09:46.620
in Pennington Gap,
Virginia.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.021
What's in Pennington Gap?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.589
ERNIE: Oh,
some decent hiking,

09:49.690 --> 09:50.624
a few antique stores...

09:50.724 --> 09:52.092
And USP Garrison.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.127
Federal prison where Maxwell
was serving his sentence.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.663
This guy's good.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.531
I mean, unhinged, maniacal
and ruthless, but good.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.001
He put together
this entire scheme

10:01.101 --> 10:03.637
from inside
a maximum security prison.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.272
It would've taken
years of planning,

10:05.372 --> 10:06.473
a chess master's
understanding

10:06.573 --> 10:08.241
of strategy and...

10:08.341 --> 10:09.476
An inside man.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.744
WHISTLER:
Someone who would give him

10:10.844 --> 10:11.745
access to the Internet

10:11.845 --> 10:13.013
and room to operate.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.614
And who spent
just as much time inside

10:14.715 --> 10:16.616
as Maxwell himself.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.853
Meet Lieutenant Gary Shay.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.655
And he's had
a sudden influx

10:21.755 --> 10:23.657
of expendable income.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.227
(alarm buzzes)

10:27.327 --> 10:30.597
This is everything
from Herman Maxwell's cell.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.200
Not much in there, hmm?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.235
Sandals,

10:35.335 --> 10:36.804
soap...

10:36.904 --> 10:38.939
ramen...

10:39.039 --> 10:40.908
books.
Why does a psychiatrist

10:41.008 --> 10:43.376
need to inventory an escaped
prisoner's personal effects?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.780
Just finishing up my profile.
Insurance reasons.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.582
Oh, careful.
That's a first edition.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.719
Sorry.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.721
Searching for
hidden cell phones.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.522
That important
for your profile?

10:55.622 --> 10:57.090
Yeah, I barely
got to know Maxwell.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.859
He's a hard nut to crack.
I mean,

10:58.959 --> 11:00.427
how does a guy
like that--

11:00.527 --> 11:02.529
scrawny, annoying--

11:02.629 --> 11:05.866
manage to attract
a following?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.968
I don't get to know the inmates.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.005
You knew he had a first edition.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.942
Not a crime.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.778
And you can't be blamed if
he told you about his beliefs--

11:17.878 --> 11:20.513
conspiracy theories,
government cabals--

11:20.613 --> 11:22.049
no matter how batty they are.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.017
You done?
Supposed to be my day off.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.719
I'd like to go home now.
But what you

11:25.819 --> 11:28.688
can be blamed for
is buying his BS

11:28.789 --> 11:32.292
and enabling his operation
from inside

11:32.392 --> 11:33.727
this very prison.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.329
Not a psychiatrist, are you?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.765
Nope.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.999
You're a Fed.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.633
Well, technically,
a suspended Fed.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.502
I was accused of killing
my former partner,

11:42.602 --> 11:43.837
but that's a long story.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.039
Okay, so what is this?
Distraction.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.841
You come in here
on your day off,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.510
and my colleagues execute
a warrant to search your house.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.979
(cell phone chimes)

11:53.513 --> 11:55.949
Which they've completed,
and, uh,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.384
ooh...

11:57.484 --> 11:58.752
Doesn't look good for you.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.620
What are you doing
with five

12:00.720 --> 12:02.689
high-powered servers
in your basement?

12:02.790 --> 12:03.957
I got nothing to say.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.658
Yeah, well, we both know
that's not true.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.294
You got plenty to say,

12:07.394 --> 12:08.896
and I'm an excellent listener.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.198
So you might as well
have a seat.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.301
Don't worry, you're gonna
get to know the inmates,

12:14.401 --> 12:15.735
believe me.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.447
Herman Maxwell wormed his way
into Lieutenant Shay's head.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.182
He convinced him
that he was the key

12:29.282 --> 12:31.518
to freeing the common man from
the shackles of big government.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.386
Used him to gain access
to the Internet.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.889
Communicate instructions
to his followers.

12:35.989 --> 12:36.890
Plan his attacks.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.458
Including framing me.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.493
So, Shay was basically
his right-hand man.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.830
I mean, he must know
where Maxwell is now.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.465
He's a glorified errand boy.
No actionable intel.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.901
But we do have the servers
from Shay's basement.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.870
We have
something else, too.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.338
Element of surprise.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.406
Maxwell has no idea
we found the servers.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.542
Probably contain
messages, transactions.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.378
Potentially every move
he's made or will make.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.081
Kasie has the servers now.
Analyzing them with Ernie.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.750
Okay, it might help us track him
down. Take him off the board.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.020
Parker, you have a standing
invitation to cuff him yourself.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.222
I'd like nothing more, but...

13:09.322 --> 13:10.757
I'm gonna stick close to Vivian.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.559
How's she doing?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.295
She's out of surgery. Bullet
didn't hit anything vital.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.663
She'll pull through.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.198
Good to hear.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.432
Listen, Tennant,

13:19.532 --> 13:22.069
when you bring Maxwell in,

13:22.169 --> 13:23.971
you give him my regards.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.275
"All that we see
or seem

13:28.375 --> 13:30.710
is but a dream
within a dream."

13:30.810 --> 13:32.012
That's beautiful.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.380
Ernie Malik?
(scoffs)

13:33.480 --> 13:34.614
Edgar Allan Poe,
actually.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.249
It was inscribed
in the first edition

13:36.349 --> 13:37.484
from Maxwell's
prison cell.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.020
Someone quoted Poe
in a Poe book?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.421
Tacky, right? Who does that?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.056
"W.S.," apparently.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.357
Whoever that is
cared enough

13:44.457 --> 13:45.926
to give Maxwell
this first edition.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.228
Though not quite enough
to write an original quote.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.629
Fascinating.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.664
Fascinating in an
"it helps us breach

13:51.764 --> 13:53.566
these encrypted servers"
kind of way?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.268
More in a
"might give us insight

13:55.368 --> 13:56.736
into Maxwell's past"
kind of way.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.906
Well, I would love
to mull the mystery

13:59.006 --> 14:01.174
of the tacky inscription
with you for hours,

14:01.274 --> 14:02.943
but again, encrypted servers.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.745
An actual clue to finding
Maxwell in the present.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.447
What level encryption
are we dealing with?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.616
AES 256. Unhackable.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.919
Yeah, for everybody else,
but not you guys, right?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.921
Unhackable means unhackable,

14:14.021 --> 14:16.389
not sometimes hackable
because we're neat.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.691
But then you just use
a backdoor or brute force.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.694
There is no backdoor to AES,
and it's virtually impenetrable

14:21.794 --> 14:23.696
to brute force.
Got it.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.499
Virtually
impenetrable means

14:26.599 --> 14:28.201
a little bit
penetrable, right?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.603
It doesn't matter. This isn't
AES. It's a Rook block cipher.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.472
Basically the same thing.
Unhackable.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.441
Unless, of course,
you saved the life

14:34.541 --> 14:35.808
of the man who invented it while

14:35.909 --> 14:38.011
thwarting a menacing
hacker attack on the island,

14:38.111 --> 14:40.680
and he gave you
the key as a thank you.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.183
And voilà.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.352
We're in.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.956
Wow. I got to hand it to you,
that was awesome.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.357
Incredible, Ernie.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.659
I bet your boyfriend
can't do that.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.527
Firstly, not my boyfriend.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.929
Secondly, not a competition.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.330
Course not. I was
just saying, if it was,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.266
I-I-I totally win this round.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.068
Got something.
Actually, four somethings.

15:01.168 --> 15:05.205
Cell phones currently sending
messages back and forth,

15:05.305 --> 15:06.806
and they're all on Oahu.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.711
Got four pings from the phones.
Probably Unkindness members.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.480
And definitely heading
towards Ford Island.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.881
It's the heart of Pearl Harbor.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.950
Navy's holding public tours
for RIMPAC today.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.885
TORRES:
It's a prime target
for an attack.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
We should be there.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.555
No, I got 50 NCIS and FBI agents
on the scene.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.292
I have another 150
Base Security on call.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.494
Okay, let me rephrase this--
I should be there.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.962
You'll get your shot.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.831
Guys, we do not make
a move until we have

15:31.931 --> 15:35.168
eyes on Maxwell. Strict recon,
short of an imminent threat.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.403
Understood, boss.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.671
(indistinct chatter)

15:39.906 --> 15:41.708
I feel like I stick out
like a sore thumb.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.045
You may be a tad overdressed
for crowd recon.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.114
Really?
(chuckles)

15:47.214 --> 15:48.748
It's a terrific
pantsuit.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.750
You're definitely the most
stylish undercover agent here.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.286
You were standing right there
when I got dressed today.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.521
Mm-hmm, and you
were so excited

15:54.621 --> 15:55.989
to match your belt
to your boots.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.059
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

15:59.159 --> 16:01.428
All four pings are converging
on the Missouri.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.895
We have nothing.
There's too many tourists.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.497
TENNANT (over comms):
Okay, according to GPS,

16:04.597 --> 16:05.532
they're on the stair landing.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.034
Jesse, go.
Kai.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.007
Federal agents.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
Nobody move.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.718
Any of these guys look
like terrorists to y'all?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.321
Nah. No, not in the least.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.490
(sighs)

16:30.590 --> 16:32.292
Search them anyway,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.628
but I'm guessing
we just got played.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.897
KNIGHT:
They were all members of the

16:37.997 --> 16:40.967
East Lansing Senior
Singles Travel Club.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.835
Someone threw
The Unkindness cell phones

16:42.935 --> 16:44.704
into their fanny packs.
Unbelievable.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.939
Or totally believable.
I should've seen it coming.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.675
How would you have
seen that one coming?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.677
Because I literally wrote
the book on Herman Maxwell.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.445
It was a dossier,
from years ago.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.114
But I know how he thinks.
Or I thought I did.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.782
Okay, so throw it out.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.085
Start from scratch.
There's no time.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.719
Time is a construct.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.554
Now you're just
quoting me to me.

17:01.654 --> 17:02.889
Okay, you need to buck up.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.424
You're the best cyber guy
that we've got.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.493
Cyber specialist,
but point taken.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.463
And the only one who can
figure out Maxwell.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.201
You know, with all these
compliments...
Ernie!

17:14.301 --> 17:17.504
Okay, he had to be coordinating
this, maybe a fifth cell phone.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.038
Signal in and out.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.109
Someone turning it on
for a moment, then back off.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.443
But if it exists,

17:23.543 --> 17:24.844
I think I could
power it up remotely.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.747
(typing on keyboard)
(computer trills)

17:28.548 --> 17:29.549
Is that the phone?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.050
Yeah.
Fifth cell phone

17:31.151 --> 17:32.285
just came on line,

17:32.385 --> 17:33.720
and it's currently
inside the Marquess hotel.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.022
Okay, I am gonna go tell
Tennant and Torres.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.057
See? (chuckles)

17:38.158 --> 17:40.059
The best.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.162
(door opens)

17:42.262 --> 17:43.530
(door closes)

17:46.999 --> 17:50.803
Thank you.
Well, this looks delightful.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.278
Herman Maxwell.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.180
Federal agents.
Let me see your hands.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.449
Might as well mix
a couple more of these.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.516
Need to see those hands.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.252
Ah.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.287
He's holding something.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.489
(crowd gasps)

18:10.657 --> 18:11.791
Drop it now.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.660
You really don't want me
to do that.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.228
(switch beeps)
(crowd gasps, screams)

18:27.240 --> 18:29.041
All right,
let's remain calm...

18:29.876 --> 18:31.010
...and no one
gets hurt.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.245
Okay, Mr. Maxwell?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.613
Well, I'm not the one

18:33.713 --> 18:35.815
whose bloodstream's coursing
with adrenaline,

18:35.915 --> 18:36.883
Special Agent...

18:36.983 --> 18:37.884
Tennant.

18:37.984 --> 18:38.918
Or pointing a gun.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.920
We'll put our weapons down

18:41.020 --> 18:43.089
if you put
whatever that is down.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.991
I'm sorry,
Special Agent Torres...

18:45.091 --> 18:46.893
Oh, my God, yes,
I know who you are.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.395
I know all of Parker's friends,

18:48.495 --> 18:50.630
but if I let go of this
button, it goes boom.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.500
She should stop
walking this way.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.902
We don't want me
to get fidgety.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.670
Good point.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.172
I've stopped.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.640
And maybe this has
gotten off to a far more

19:00.740 --> 19:02.275
adversarial start
than it needs to.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.844
So why don't we just
order some food,

19:04.944 --> 19:06.045
have a chat?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.814
Oh, I'm not hungry. Uh, you?

19:09.816 --> 19:10.750
(chuckles)

19:10.850 --> 19:11.784
Look, why don't we let

19:11.884 --> 19:13.019
all these tourists go,

19:13.119 --> 19:14.787
so no one else
makes you fidgety?

19:14.887 --> 19:16.823
Sure.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.596
Knight should
escort them out.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.632
I'll do it.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.268
No. "Let's eat.
Let's talk."

19:28.368 --> 19:30.903
She oozes
hostage negotiator.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.939
You didn't volunteer

19:33.039 --> 19:34.907
to escort the patrons out,
so you're the boss.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.410
You did volunteer, so you know
the Parker connection

19:37.510 --> 19:39.212
will exasperate me,

19:39.312 --> 19:41.881
and you want to eliminate
that issue. Very smart,

19:41.981 --> 19:43.750
all of you.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.319
Get them out
of here, Knight.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.120
Tennant...
We'll be fine.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.456
We'll see.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.125
Excuse me.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.827
I'm NCIS
Special Agent Knight.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.797
I need everyone to follow me out
immediately. Let's go.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.199
(overlapping chatter)

20:06.072 --> 20:07.874
MAXWELL:
Special Agent Knight,

20:07.974 --> 20:10.310
you should know that
I'm holding a dead man's switch,

20:10.410 --> 20:12.479
which is connected
to a device that will release

20:12.579 --> 20:15.448
enough nerve agent to cause
significant casualties, so

20:15.548 --> 20:17.049
if anyone else tries
to come in...

20:17.149 --> 20:19.218
It goes boom. Got it.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.753
Fast learner.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.623
Now, you two, take out
your comms, put them on the bar.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.264
Step back, please.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.505
Now, I know
you don't want

20:38.605 --> 20:41.040
to give up your weapons, but
I don't want you to keep them,

20:41.140 --> 20:43.242
so...

20:43.343 --> 20:45.712
let's find our way out
of this conundrum.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.617
JESSE:
Okay, let's go, guys.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.520
My team is clear.
Nobody in or out of that bar.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.987
Unless we need
to make an entrance.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.188
I'd rather not,

20:56.289 --> 20:57.757
since our friends
are inside,

20:57.857 --> 20:59.992
and it took me years
to break in Tennant as a boss.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.129
Hey. I just spoke to Lucy.
She says EOD's on their way.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.831
Already here.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.401
Uh, where's Boom-Boom?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.069
He's TDY. I'm Bam Bam.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.305
(laughs)

21:13.005 --> 21:14.206
Seriously? Or...

21:14.307 --> 21:16.743
Does it look like I'm kidding?

21:17.877 --> 21:18.911
It's hard to say. I...

21:19.646 --> 21:21.080
I heard there was
a hostage situation

21:21.180 --> 21:22.615
and an explosive device
that needs some disarming.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.150
Would anyone
like to focus on that?

21:24.250 --> 21:25.518
Yeah.
KNIGHT: Device is not

21:25.618 --> 21:26.919
in the bar,
as far as we can tell.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.755
JESSE: We're doing
a room-to-room search,

21:28.855 --> 21:30.222
checking the hotel's
security cameras, but,

21:30.323 --> 21:31.924
honestly, Maxwell
has a bigger problem

21:32.024 --> 21:34.461
with the government than he does
the hospitality industry, so...

21:34.561 --> 21:36.396
We're guessing
the bomb's off-site.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.697
Did you get a look
at the detonator?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.298
Briefly. No wires
from what I could see.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.267
So, if the device
is outside of the hotel,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.002
the detonator's
talking to it.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.373
Yeah, which means we might be
able to triangulate the signal.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.807
JESSE: Look,
with RIMPAC going on,

21:47.907 --> 21:49.509
there's a lot of possible
targets. How about we

21:49.609 --> 21:51.478
find the device, disable it
before he loses interest

21:51.578 --> 21:53.746
in our friends
and decides it's game over?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.652
ERNIE:
"Though subject

21:59.752 --> 22:01.754
"has a limited
social media presence,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.357
"the posts that exist
focus almost exclusively

22:04.457 --> 22:05.692
"on government attempts
to control

22:05.792 --> 22:08.227
the thought and actions
of its citizens."

22:08.327 --> 22:09.762
(groans)

22:09.862 --> 22:10.763
(grunts)

22:10.863 --> 22:12.399
That pablum

22:12.499 --> 22:15.267
could describe any member of any
anti-government group anywhere.

22:15.368 --> 22:18.204
Where's the insight,
the analysis?

22:18.304 --> 22:19.472
I was an idiot
when I wrote it.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.873
No, here. I found
some insight. "S..."

22:20.973 --> 22:21.908
Let me guess,

22:22.008 --> 22:23.275
"While we find no overt threats

22:23.376 --> 22:24.544
"to specific targets,

22:24.644 --> 22:26.078
"we cannot rule out
those threats

22:26.178 --> 22:27.380
being made in other ways."

22:27.480 --> 22:30.116
Did you memorize
Maxwell's dossier?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.584
Only the parts I hated.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.486
LUCY: Okay, uh,
that's a lot of

22:33.586 --> 22:35.321
not helpful self-loathing.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.789
Technology's better now,

22:36.889 --> 22:38.525
so let's figure out
how we can use it to

22:38.625 --> 22:40.026
learn more about him.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.530
Great idea.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.632
Okay,
so what do we do?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.734
I'm gonna start... thinking.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.136
You two should start talking.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.571
About what?
ERNIE: Doesn't matter.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.339
It's all white noise.
Uh, the weather,

22:53.440 --> 22:55.174
sports, your relationship.
Really?

22:55.274 --> 22:56.275
I vote not sports.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.309
Just talk.
LUCY: Uh...

22:57.410 --> 22:59.011
Well, there's-there's us.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.312
Obviously, we

23:00.413 --> 23:02.181
moved pretty fast
through the

23:02.281 --> 23:03.550
"will they,
or won't they,

23:03.650 --> 23:06.052
yes, then no, then no..."
(both chuckle)

23:06.152 --> 23:08.555
"...then yes."

23:08.655 --> 23:10.790
Good.
But...

23:10.890 --> 23:13.660
uh, since giving
our relationship a try,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.361
we managed to put
all that behind us.

23:15.462 --> 23:16.596
ERNIE:
Uh-huh.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.964
But there were
still some things

23:18.064 --> 23:19.632
we didn't know
about each other.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.233
For instance, Kate is the
only person in the world

23:21.333 --> 23:22.935
who doesn't like
pineapples.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.971
Mm.
And she loves
to make her bed

23:25.071 --> 23:26.706
as soon as she leaves it.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.709
And Lucy is really ticklish
behind her right knee,

23:29.809 --> 23:30.910
and she would

23:31.010 --> 23:32.945
eat pizza every day,
if she could.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.881
(both laugh)
Uh-uh.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.382
LUCY:
But I-I guess what
you're really asking

23:36.483 --> 23:38.417
is if it's working.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.053
And I would say...

23:43.556 --> 23:44.957
Definitely.
Yes.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.593
Thank you.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.595
What? What?
You calmed my brain

23:48.695 --> 23:49.796
with your happy talk,

23:49.896 --> 23:51.531
maybe even made me
a better person.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.032
Really?
No.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.535
But I did figure out
what motivates Maxwell.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.404
Turns out it's...

23:58.505 --> 23:59.405
nothing.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.807
So, I ran his posts

24:00.907 --> 24:02.441
through a plagiarism filter.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.143
New technology.
Thank you, Lucy.
Mm-hmm.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.679
Turns out, it's
a cut-and-paste masterpiece

24:06.779 --> 24:09.682
from an obscure paper
written almost 20 years ago

24:09.782 --> 24:12.018
by a professor
who specializes in

24:12.118 --> 24:13.385
crowd psychology.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.587
How to control
groups of people?
ERNIE: Yeah.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.923
Professor's name
is Woodrow Staggs.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.794
W.S.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.197
Like the inscription in the
Poe book from Maxwell's cell.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.566
Where is he?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.269
ERNIE:
According to travel records,
here on the island.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.605
Why?
I have no idea.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.175
Ticklish, huh?

24:39.245 --> 24:41.213
Sorry.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.449
Okay.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.917
We're unarmed.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.318
No comms.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.820
Just the three of us.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.921
Now what?

24:49.021 --> 24:50.990
We wait.
Look, I don't know you.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.826
Torres didn't work the case
that got you arrested.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.695
So, while it seems
like you were waiting

24:55.795 --> 24:58.397
for someone,
it doesn't seem to be us.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.667
Well, I'd love to see
Agent Parker, but

25:00.767 --> 25:03.269
with him on the verge
of losing his job and

25:03.369 --> 25:05.304
going to prison...

25:05.404 --> 25:06.939
He's not going anywhere.

25:10.777 --> 25:14.781
What about "dead man's switch"
do you not understand?

25:15.582 --> 25:16.649
The glass that was

25:16.749 --> 25:18.117
on the table
that you just palmed.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.886
Oh. Yeah, this glass?

25:19.986 --> 25:21.854
I wasn't gonna
throw it. I'm...

25:21.954 --> 25:23.122
I'm just bored.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.891
Talking to
psychopaths just

25:24.991 --> 25:26.759
make me thirsty.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.994
MAXWELL:
Looking at you,
I'd say you're here

25:28.094 --> 25:29.762
to be the muscle,
but boredom

25:29.862 --> 25:31.330
as a negative transference?

25:31.430 --> 25:34.066
A subconscious attempt
to lead me to the idea that

25:34.166 --> 25:36.035
this isn't worthwhile.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.137
Well played.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.238
Did it work?

25:39.338 --> 25:41.240
No, not at all,
but if we're

25:41.340 --> 25:42.709
gonna be waiting together,

25:42.809 --> 25:44.777
I'm glad to have interesting
people to talk to.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.479
You want to give us a clue
about what we're waiting for?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.182
Not particularly.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.955
What's happening
in the bar?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.690
Lot of talking.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.258
Maxwell seems calm.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.627
Well, he has been in jail

26:00.727 --> 26:02.061
for ten years.
Plenty of time to work on

26:02.161 --> 26:04.130
centering exercises
for a moment like this.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.132
What, you think he was
in jail meditating?

26:06.232 --> 26:07.233
That's what I'd do.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.868
(scoffs)

26:08.968 --> 26:10.569
I'd be writing letters
to my wife,

26:10.670 --> 26:12.038
begging her
to wait for me.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.975
You think she wouldn't?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.309
Nah. (chuckles)

26:17.409 --> 26:19.278
She's solid.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.680
I mean, I do have

26:20.780 --> 26:22.014
this cousin in Scottsdale

26:22.114 --> 26:23.750
who's always had eyes
for her, but...

26:24.884 --> 26:26.686
(chuckles)
(cell phone buzzes)

26:26.786 --> 26:28.621
(cell phone beeps)
Kai, tell me where you are.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.622
KAI (over phone):
Look up. 2:00.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.190
You'll see us.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.160
JESSE:
I got you.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.629
Uh, we found
a signal booster.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.364
Bam Bam's
working on it, so...

26:38.464 --> 26:40.166
If she can disable it, it could
shut down Maxwell's detonator.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.269
All right, go tell the snipers
to get ready to take the shot.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.137
Got it.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.373
Hey. You.

26:47.473 --> 26:48.607
My name is Kai.
Whatever.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.677
Pass me another alligator clip.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.250
JESSE (over phone):
How close is she
to disabling it?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.752
I'm... kind of afraid to ask.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.754
Come on, man.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.757
Hey, Bam Bam.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.093
Any idea how long
this is gonna take?

27:07.193 --> 27:09.128
Not long, if you want me
to rush it

27:09.228 --> 27:11.698
and possibly activate the bomb.
So, it depends.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.132
No, that's-that's the opposite
of what we want.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.167
Yup, and it would be
very, very bad

27:15.267 --> 27:17.069
for my professional
reputation, so...

27:17.169 --> 27:20.272
You know, you and Boom-Boom
have the same bomb-side manner.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.310
Okay. Everything's
in place.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.778
Jesse,
we're good to go.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.479
JESSE:
Copy that.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.547
You want to say a little prayer?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.882
If you think it'll help.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.424
Okay, why didn't your,
uh... (stammers) ...your...

27:38.524 --> 27:40.292
your thingy activate?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.194
The MD/MDIX auto switcher.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.263
Bad guy built a failsafe
to protect his signal.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.264
What does that mean?

27:45.364 --> 27:46.665
Might mean nothing.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.334
Might mean I've made things
much, much worse.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.410
Okay, so what do you think?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.578
Well, two minutes have
passed, and nothing

27:59.678 --> 28:01.547
has exploded,
so that's a plus.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.883
But you still figure this thing
is talking to a bomb somewhere?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.484
Probably.

28:05.584 --> 28:08.520
Okay, so we keep triangulating,
from this to the bomb.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.089
This would be so much easier
if we knew

28:10.189 --> 28:11.457
what we were looking for.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.625
I mean, it would be
easier if criminals

28:13.726 --> 28:15.127
just handed
themselves in, but

28:15.227 --> 28:16.362
if they did,
we'd be out of jobs.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.730
Speak for yourself.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.999
I have a master's
in electrical engineering.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.801
Nice.

28:21.901 --> 28:25.171
We really appreciate you
coming in, Professor Staggs.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.572
I must confess to being confused

28:26.672 --> 28:28.340
why I needed to be dragged
to Pearl Harbor

28:28.440 --> 28:30.376
from a beautiful view
and some really bad golf.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.144
Did you write this?

28:32.244 --> 28:34.246
(sighs) Yes.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.315
Yes, I did, 20 years ago.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.017
Nobody really cared
about it then, so...

28:38.117 --> 28:39.585
ERNIE:
I'm not sure that that's true.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.388
Uh, there's been plenty
of influencing, disrupting,

28:42.488 --> 28:44.490
corrupting and usurping
of various groups

28:44.590 --> 28:46.525
in the intervening years.
Not by me.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.927
WHISTLER:
But you did get a grant

28:48.027 --> 28:50.529
from the military to run
a PsyOps pilot program

28:50.629 --> 28:52.464
training people
in your theories.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.133
In how to influence people
to undermine

28:54.233 --> 28:55.667
hostile organizations.
Yes,

28:55.768 --> 28:57.770
and, like my paper,
it did not get much traction.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.471
The program was cancelled
after a couple years.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.173
I've been an academic
for the past 18.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.508
Do you recognize him?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.077
Herman Maxwell.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.113
He looks vaguely familiar.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.949
Maybe from the program?
Or your university?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.517
Could he have been
a superfan?

29:11.617 --> 29:14.086
(laughs) Don't see many of those
in the crowd psych biz.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.354
Well, you gave him

29:15.454 --> 29:18.457
this with
an inscription.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.993
All right, well, I...

29:21.093 --> 29:22.528
I used to do a lot of that then.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.231
Professor Staggs,
we have two agents

29:25.331 --> 29:26.999
in the Marquess
with Maxwell.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.267
He's holding
a detonator,

29:28.367 --> 29:29.969
probably to a-a
nerve agent bomb.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.904
He's already killed
multiple people, j...

29:32.004 --> 29:34.506
Please try a little harder.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.776
I'm sorry. Trust me, I...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.611
I-I want to help. I...

29:40.913 --> 29:43.282
He's just not ringing any bells.
I'm sorry.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.518
You two, talk about
your relationship some more.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.654
As relaxing as you find it,
Ernie, I'm not going to talk

29:48.754 --> 29:51.557
about how much I love Lucy
in front of Professor Staggs.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.761
That's really sweet.
Thank you.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.065
You're welcome.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.100
Okay,
Professor Staggs,

30:01.200 --> 30:02.701
it seems like
a big coincidence

30:02.801 --> 30:04.837
that both you and Maxwell
are on the island right now.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.438
STAGGS:
Yes, well, it is
a big coincidence.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.574
Believe me, I'm here
in sort of a family...

30:08.674 --> 30:10.576
Done.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.618
Can you lose the beard?

30:27.726 --> 30:29.862
His name's not Maxwell.
It's Jason.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.497
It's Jason Hearns. Yes.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.565
He was in my PsyOps
pilot program,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.567
and I had to
let him go.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.735
Why?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.905
Clinically speaking?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.706
He was crazy.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.680
You know, typically at this
point in a hostage situation,

30:48.780 --> 30:50.549
we are negotiating
a deal.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.185
Patience.
Something you learn

30:53.285 --> 30:54.954
sitting in a cell
for years on end.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.455
I wouldn't know.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.624
No, you wouldn't
do well, Nick Torres.

30:58.724 --> 30:59.992
All those years
undercover,

31:00.092 --> 31:03.262
then running around D.C.
with your gun waving.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.297
You don't know who I am.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.598
Sadly, I do.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.834
You wear your personality
on your sleeve,

31:08.935 --> 31:11.837
and it's not
particularly interesting.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.509
Yeah, Torres,

31:17.609 --> 31:19.611
you need to find a better hobby
than brooding.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.747
TORRES:
I have a tragic backstory,

31:21.847 --> 31:22.915
what can you do?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.316
MAXWELL:
Little cliché, isn't it, though?

31:24.416 --> 31:26.352
Deep dark secrets,
wearing a mask

31:26.452 --> 31:29.355
of pain to cover up...
What?

31:29.455 --> 31:31.723
We all have them, don't we,

31:31.823 --> 31:32.992
Jason?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.627
Masks.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.363
MAXWELL:
Wow. You know my name.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.065
Took you long enough to use it.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.599
You're wearing a mask.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.001
We needed to know
what you're trying to project

31:42.101 --> 31:43.735
in order to know what
you're trying to protect.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.004
MAXWELL:
Phrasing. I like it.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.338
Honestly, though,

31:46.438 --> 31:48.707
you couldn't even begin
to understand.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.580
(laughs)

31:54.680 --> 31:56.848
And I thought you two
were being smart on your own.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.118
You think finding
Professor Staggs

31:59.218 --> 32:00.619
changes things here?

32:00.719 --> 32:02.154
I have half
the military on this

32:02.254 --> 32:05.024
island waiting to see
if I kill the two of you.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.159
I am still in control.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.860
What are your people
doing, Tennant?

32:08.961 --> 32:10.162
Hm?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.464
Escalating this
when we need solutions.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.201
We're just trying
to clean up the mess

32:15.301 --> 32:16.835
that you brought
onto our shores.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.238
Well, it's your brilliant
leadership that got us here.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.539
Okay, you two, stand down.

32:20.639 --> 32:21.940
Screw you, Torres.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.542
(whispers): Need time
to disarm the bomb.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.610
Oh, you'd like that.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.112
MAXWELL:
I mean it. Back off.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.579
The professor?
Too dangerous.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.548
Not if you were
the last man

32:29.648 --> 32:30.816
alive.
Okay, you know what?

32:30.916 --> 32:32.251
I'm done. I'm done
talking to him,

32:32.351 --> 32:33.685
and I sure as hell
can't talk to you.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.588
Move away from each other,
or I will shoot you both.

32:36.688 --> 32:40.226
Looks like our little dialogue
here has broken down.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.893
You are useless to me.

32:41.994 --> 32:45.464
So, maybe I will just release
this button and end it now.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.134
TORRES:
Maybe we can bring your friend,

32:48.234 --> 32:49.501
the professor,

32:49.601 --> 32:51.003
let him talk to you.

32:52.838 --> 32:55.407
We could just start
from the beginning.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.976
No. Go ahead.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.546
Bring the professor.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.854
Hey, we've been running
for, like, an hour.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.489
What are we looking for?
Following a signal

33:10.589 --> 33:11.790
that's communicating
with the booster

33:11.890 --> 33:13.325
but having a hard time
landing on it.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.693
What, you mean,
like, it's moving?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.495
Maybe, in a car
or on a bike.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.997
Anybody seem
to be circling?

33:19.098 --> 33:20.166
No.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.000
Hey, we're in the
right area, right?

33:22.101 --> 33:23.435
Yes, it seems like it.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.137
Okay.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.610
Ernie,

33:31.710 --> 33:33.145
check my location,
see if it matches

33:33.245 --> 33:35.814
with any possible targets
connected to RIMPAC.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.949
Yeah, the device
is here somewhere.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.952
Maybe we can ID the target,
just help us find it.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.856
You sure you're good
doing this?
Hell no.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.025
It's terrifying.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.996
But I trained Hearns,
I want to help stop him, so...

33:51.097 --> 33:52.364
What exactly did you
train him for?

33:52.464 --> 33:55.201
I was creating
a virtual army online

33:55.301 --> 33:56.868
who could attract fringe groups:

33:56.968 --> 33:58.170
white supremacists, terrorists.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.638
Identify them,

33:59.738 --> 34:01.207
take them out,

34:01.307 --> 34:02.274
but instead...

34:02.374 --> 34:04.476
You created one.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.246
He built a network of toadies
to help him.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.981
He's gonna assume
he can manipulate you as well.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.318
Well, I am an expert
in human behavior

34:12.418 --> 34:13.419
with a great deal of experience

34:13.519 --> 34:14.986
studying
alternate personalities.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.089
Yeah, but he's
a psychopath,

34:17.189 --> 34:18.824
and he hasn't gotten
any more stable

34:18.924 --> 34:20.826
in the years since
you last saw him.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.895
(cell phone dings)

34:24.996 --> 34:27.933
Kai and Bam Bam have narrowed
down a location of the device.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.401
They could probably
use some help.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.802
Yeah, put me in, coach.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.577
We need you to
buy us some time.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.046
I'll do my best.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.518
None of the Navy physical assets
are anywhere near that park.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.620
No presentations
or tours.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.589
Hold on. A bunch
of sailors from the

34:50.689 --> 34:52.023
USS Essex are having
a spirit day

34:52.124 --> 34:53.859
with foreign
visiting sailors.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.628
What, you mean, like,
sack races and balloon fights?

34:56.728 --> 34:58.697
It says flag football,
but same idea.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.232
Well, why would Hearns attack
a bunch of sailors

35:00.332 --> 35:01.533
running slant routes?

35:01.633 --> 35:03.569
Oh, see, you know sports.
Slant routes.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.070
It was literally
the only football specific

35:05.171 --> 35:06.472
I could think of. My brother
once scored a touchdown

35:06.572 --> 35:08.307
in high school
running a...

35:09.608 --> 35:10.976
What do you see?

35:11.076 --> 35:13.545
Petty Officer
Second Class Leo Staggs.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.216
Professor Staggs said
he was here for family.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.285
I-I think Leo's his son.
(line ringing)

35:19.385 --> 35:20.986
JESSE (over phone): Ernie.
Jesse, you got to keep Staggs

35:21.086 --> 35:23.755
from entering the bar.
What'd you say?

35:23.855 --> 35:25.891
Don't let Staggs in.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.264
Hello, Jason.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.866
Professor Staggs.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.072
This was all
a setup.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.209
We were supposed
to bring Staggs here.

35:43.309 --> 35:46.912
Well done,
Special Agent Tennant.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.258
Jason, this is
a no-win situation.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.892
How can I help you
see that?

36:00.992 --> 36:03.329
Well, it was a no-win situation
the minute you cut me loose.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.496
That was 20 years ago.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.997
TENNANT:
Professor, I think it's best

36:06.097 --> 36:07.833
if you don't engage
in conversation with Mr. Hearns.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.969
All due respect,
Special Agent Tennant, shut up.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.338
This is my moment.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.139
Hey, look, we get it.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.742
You did all this so we'd
bring Staggs to you.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.110
You're going through
your list of grievances.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.479
You take down Parker,

36:20.579 --> 36:22.948
you take down the mean
man who fired you.

36:23.048 --> 36:24.816
You have something
you want to say?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.218
I don't want to say anything.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.987
Parker put me away.
No big deal. I ruined him.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.356
But this man--

36:30.456 --> 36:32.524
this man abandoned me.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.627
Told me working with him
would give purpose to my life,

36:35.727 --> 36:39.064
would make up for growing up
in a foster home surrounded by

36:39.164 --> 36:41.066
misfits and idiots,

36:41.166 --> 36:42.601
and then he threw me away.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.570
I gave you skills. Skills
that you could've used to...

36:44.670 --> 36:47.473
To what?
Run a clandestine PsyOps

36:47.573 --> 36:49.375
operation at my grocery store?

36:49.475 --> 36:51.009
Well, I was thinking
the tech industry, but...

36:51.109 --> 36:53.512
I've built something
that you couldn't even imagine.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.747
I have people
literally willing

36:55.847 --> 36:57.883
to kill for me.
You expect me to be impressed?

36:57.983 --> 37:00.218
I expect you to be in awe.

37:06.858 --> 37:07.793
Hey.
Hey.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.361
What are we looking for?

37:12.398 --> 37:13.732
Shave ice cart.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.402
Those guys look way too built
to be vendors.

37:16.502 --> 37:19.237
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.576
(grunting)

37:32.718 --> 37:34.453
Look, killing
Professor Staggs

37:34.553 --> 37:36.488
isn't gonna undo
the harm done to you.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.557
I don't want to kill
Professor Staggs.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.360
I want him to know
that every person I hurt

37:41.460 --> 37:43.829
is because of him.
I want him to watch.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.096
Watch what?

37:45.196 --> 37:46.732
Watch me kill his son.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.902
(exhales slowly)
(grunting continues)

37:53.004 --> 37:54.406
(grunting)

37:56.041 --> 37:57.309
(shouting)

38:16.528 --> 38:19.331
Okay. What now, Bam Bam?

38:19.431 --> 38:20.499
Clear the area.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.667
This bomb
is big enough

38:21.767 --> 38:23.101
to cause some
major damage.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.971
This time, a prayer
would be useful.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.540
No, please,
don't do this.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.942
Take me.
Leave my son alone.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.444
Please.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.079
Too late. Let's watch.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.381
(beeping)

38:35.481 --> 38:37.449
(beeping stops)

38:40.352 --> 38:43.154
TORRES:
Um... I think I blinked.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.457
Did something happen?
What did you do?

38:47.459 --> 38:48.827
Torres!

38:48.927 --> 38:50.529
(grunts)

38:51.930 --> 38:53.699
(grunting)

38:54.800 --> 38:56.402
Mm-mmm.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.570
Shoot me.
TORRES: No.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.473
Promised Parker
that he could say hi.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.010
The bomb?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.545
Disabled.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.681
Your son is safe, too.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.994
(cheering, laughing)

39:26.532 --> 39:28.800
God, I love rum. Is that wrong?

39:28.900 --> 39:30.469
Well, do you love it
more or less

39:30.569 --> 39:32.137
than punching bad guys
in the face?

39:32.237 --> 39:33.839
Oh... tough call.

39:33.939 --> 39:34.973
Come on, punching.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.374
Especially since
you saved the day.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.410
I'd argue it was a group effort.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.012
You know, a lot of the credit
goes to Bam Bam. Where is she?

39:41.112 --> 39:43.381
I invited her, but she just
kind of growled at me.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.183
(laughter)

39:45.283 --> 39:47.385
Hey, uh, listen,

39:47.486 --> 39:50.055
you know I really didn't mean
all that stuff, right?

39:51.056 --> 39:55.093
About how I got my job or
not wanting to sleep with me?

39:55.927 --> 39:57.362
I feel like that's
a trick question.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.665
(chuckles)
Look, I'm sorry we gave you

39:59.765 --> 40:01.299
another terrible trip
to Hawai'i.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.301
Yeah, well,

40:03.401 --> 40:05.103
guess I'll just
have to come back.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.673
For some relaxation, right?

40:07.773 --> 40:10.141
Not because the world
is being threatened.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.811
Why not a little bit of both?

40:16.314 --> 40:17.315
Sure.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.284
Sure.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.986
Sure.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.020
Sure...

40:22.120 --> 40:24.923
(laughter)
Right? Yeah.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.225
WHISTLER:
Well, Raven got
his wings pinned,

40:27.325 --> 40:28.494
chemical weapons disabled.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.728
KNIGHT:
And Parker full of gratitude

40:29.828 --> 40:32.030
because we saved his ass.
Well done.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.733
(speaking Hawaiian)

40:34.833 --> 40:37.402
(cheering)

40:38.670 --> 40:41.272
* I speak in grey to match *

40:41.372 --> 40:42.741
* The shade on *

40:42.841 --> 40:45.443
* The inside of my brain *
(door closes)

40:45.544 --> 40:46.778
* I decay *

40:46.878 --> 40:48.714
* When my tongue touches... *

40:48.814 --> 40:50.882
Today was a good day.
Mm-hmm.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.250
And I'm only sorry

40:52.350 --> 40:53.885
I missed out on all
your breakfast goodies.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.855
I can have you a full tray
in less than 45 minutes.

40:56.955 --> 41:00.458
You do not have to do that.
(chuckles)

41:00.559 --> 41:02.961
Who doesn't love
breakfast for dinner?

41:03.061 --> 41:05.096
Or after-dinner snack?

41:05.196 --> 41:08.700
Or... breakfast.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.137
Mm-hmm.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.772
Yeah.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.174
So, in the morning?

41:16.274 --> 41:18.476
Definitely.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.945
* You look at me *

41:20.045 --> 41:24.082
* Covered in the colors of you *

41:24.182 --> 41:26.818
* Ooh *

41:26.918 --> 41:30.188
* Covered in the colors of you *

41:30.288 --> 41:31.389
* Ooh *

41:31.489 --> 41:35.060
* Red, orange, yellow, green. *
