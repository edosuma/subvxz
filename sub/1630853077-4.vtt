WEBVTT

01:20.581 --> 01:22.207
You want me to get crazier?

01:22.291 --> 01:25.627
Yeah, sure. Let's play around with it.
Give me a few minutes.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.004
Take your time.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.547
- But not too much time, huh?
- 'Kay.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.133
Can you go back to what you were saying
about changing the world?

01:32.342 --> 01:35.846
Our mission is to elevate
the world's consciousness. Period.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.222
And how do you do that?

01:37.306 --> 01:38.849
That's a great question.

01:38.932 --> 01:44.188
By living proactively and with purpose.
By being a student of life, for life.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.315
And by doing that,
it just becomes a matter of--

01:46.398 --> 01:51.111
By doing this,
we elevate ourselves and then the world.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.196
The world.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.947
How do your investors feel about that?

01:54.031 --> 01:56.533
Usually, a company's mission is
to make money.

01:56.617 --> 02:01.246
Yes. When you have the intention,
changing the world with what you do,

02:01.330 --> 02:04.958
when you have meaning
behind your work,

02:05.042 --> 02:06.668
success will follow.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.336
Adam, we're ready.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.714
And, yes, the money will follow too.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.549
Mrs. Neumann…

02:13.091 --> 02:14.635
out of the shot, please.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.868
You must be a proud papa.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.829
Thirty-four cities, 87,000 members.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.666
I don't think you wanted us to invest.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.710
Yeah, no, I saw the Instagram posts

02:48.794 --> 02:52.840
of all the members
getting white girl wasted at the day care.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.174
- Day camp?
- Summer camp.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.843
Summer camp. That's it.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.595
Excellent use of the resources
we've provided them,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.390
everybody getting wasted on our dime.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.393
So, I just want to get
the corporate structure right in my head.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.646
The wife, she works there, right?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.982
Or she doesn't work there. What's the--

03:10.065 --> 03:11.441
She's always lurking.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.610
She helps him manifest things.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.862
Right.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.365
- Are you taking the piss out of me?
- Little bit.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.534
We've invested a lot of money
in these guys.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.910
What's their burn rate again?

03:21.994 --> 03:25.205
- Gonna do 400 million this year.
- No, no.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.790
Don't fucking finger me, Bruce.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.418
I'm not asking you,
"What are they gonna make?"

03:29.501 --> 03:31.211
I'm asking you,
"What are they gonna spend?"

03:31.295 --> 03:33.881
I don't know if they covered this
at Stanford Business School.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.424
It's a little thing called profit.

03:35.507 --> 03:39.970
You see, if you spend more than you make,
then there's no "profit."

03:40.053 --> 03:42.598
They really drilled it into us at Harvard.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.392
You went to Harvard?
You never mentioned that before.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.686
Okay, let me elucidate.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.814
So, if you had a lemonade stand,
for example…

03:50.898 --> 03:52.774
All right, look, they will get there.

03:52.858 --> 03:56.153
…but the lemons cost more
than the lemonade,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.030
- They will get there.
- …and then you insist on

03:58.113 --> 03:59.865
giving the lemonade away at a discount

03:59.948 --> 04:02.284
like WeWork are giving away
their memberships--

04:02.367 --> 04:03.368
They will get there.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.621
How are they gonna get there, Bruce?
Tell me that.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.831
We've seen this movie before, haven't we?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.041
Haven't we?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.626
So what's different this time?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.712
Adam. That's what's different.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.593
This guy?

04:21.887 --> 04:25.140
What happens when he burns through
all the money that he's raised?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.477
Are you gonna give him more?

04:30.729 --> 04:32.940
We're not there yet, okay?

04:33.565 --> 04:34.566
Okay.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.110
<i>Hey, this is incredible.</i>

04:37.194 --> 04:39.488
<i>August and Ollie,</i>

04:39.571 --> 04:41.782
<i>your father is like a rock star.</i>

04:41.865 --> 04:45.410
He was so excited for you to see it.
Did you get the frame that I sent?

04:45.494 --> 04:49.540
<i>I did. I did.
He was always such a hard worker.</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:51.625
<i>A little businessman.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:56.296
He sat his mother down and informed her
he would start paying rent

04:56.380 --> 04:58.799
- <i>when he was ten years old.</i>
- Ten years old, I know.

04:58.882 --> 05:03.011
And now, he's on magazine covers
and has an amazing wife

05:03.095 --> 05:05.597
<i>and four beautiful children.</i>

05:05.681 --> 05:08.600
<i>When he gets home,
please tell him how proud I am.</i>

05:08.684 --> 05:12.771
I will. Actually, <i>Abba</i>, he just arrived.
Yeah, he just walked through the door.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.398
Honey, come say hi to your dad.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.861
Here he is.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.028
- <i>Abba!</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

05:20.112 --> 05:21.488
Did you get the magazine?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.866
<i>I have it right here.</i>

05:23.949 --> 05:25.909
<i>I already showed all the nurses.</i>

05:25.993 --> 05:28.328
Bet you did, I bet you did.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.621
Hello.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.748
Okay, we've got to go to dinner.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.043
Okay? So, we'll do it again
next week. Okay?

05:35.127 --> 05:37.838
- <i>Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.</i>
- <i>Abba</i>, bye.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.132
- Bye, bye, bye. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye. Bye-bye.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.263
- I don't like it when you get involved.
- He's trying.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.933
Enough. Enough. Enough.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.393
Your inner child's activated tonight.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.936
I've got to go to work.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.189
Adam. Adam, what are you--

05:55.272 --> 05:58.609
- It's Saturday night. We're gonna--
- Look, I got to go. I'm sorry. Okay?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.152
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

06:09.745 --> 06:14.166
We're going to open 40 new locations
and two million square feet

06:14.249 --> 06:15.792
by the end of the year!

06:18.086 --> 06:21.089
Javi, what--
What was that look you just gave Connor?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.763
I don't think that's possible.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.725
Not possible?

06:32.643 --> 06:37.523
We're on pace to open eight new locations
by the end of the year.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.775
And that would be our best year yet.

06:39.858 --> 06:44.696
Since 1987, Starbucks has opened,
on average, two stores a day.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.114
Yeah, we're not Starbucks.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.491
I agree. I agree.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.493
We should be bigger than Starbucks.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.497
Adam. Landlords get coffee.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.084
They don't all get coworking space.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.461
Not in Columbus, Ohio.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.880
You know, they say
that if they're gonna do a land grab--

07:01.964 --> 07:04.883
They say--
They say the same things they've said

07:04.967 --> 07:08.011
since we tried to open
our very first location.

07:08.095 --> 07:13.976
I don't care if it's Columbus, Ohio,
or Mars. You understand?

07:14.059 --> 07:16.436
It's your job to make it happen.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.896
Maybe you missed the sign.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.734
- I'm working my ass off for you.
- All right, all right.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.612
Plus, I left my sister's wedding
to come here.

07:25.696 --> 07:30.325
Go back to your sister's wedding.
You'll be doing me a favor.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.578
Who wants to be
the new head of leasing?

07:32.661 --> 07:34.246
You can't do worse than Javi.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.628
Why are we

07:41.712 --> 07:46.258
not growing faster?

07:47.551 --> 07:50.637
Because landlords think
your business model is bullshit.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.016
Bro, we lease office space.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.894
We hang a few Edison light bulbs
and a neon sign,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.937
and then we act like
we're changing the world.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.355
This is what you really think?

08:00.439 --> 08:02.983
And you pay us shit money to do it.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.110
Bro, I work seven days a week for you.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.071
I'm supposed to be all rah-rah
about your insane expansion plan

08:08.155 --> 08:11.241
because there's free kombucha on tap?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.578
- Fuck this.
- Javi, Javi, Javi, Javi, Javi.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.996
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.166
I've been under a lot of pressure
this week.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.086
I can't afford to lose you.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.880
Yeah. Life's too short, man.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.840
What if I gave you a 10% raise?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.051
Not worth it.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.636
What if I double your salary?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.058
It looks like you're thinking it over.

08:39.061 --> 08:44.525
Why don't we continue this discussion
over drinks and a meal?

08:47.486 --> 08:50.572
The Wagyu was flown in
this morning from Japan.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.827
Javi, have I convinced you to stay?

08:56.662 --> 08:59.373
Javi, Javi, come.

08:59.873 --> 09:04.253
Come, come, come, come, come, come.
Yes, come. Okay, sit, sit.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.257
And that-- And that is how you do it.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.592
If a landlord says no, double the rent.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.720
If that doesn't work,
double the lease terms.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.139
Invite them to discuss it over a meal.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.476
Whatever it takes, blow their minds.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.019
They're blind!

09:21.103 --> 09:24.106
And it's your job to make them see.
<i>Lehayim!</i>

09:24.773 --> 09:27.025
Well, I just don't get it,
what you're trying to do.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.653
- Don't get it.
- Okay.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.781
- What if we went higher on the rent?
- How much higher?

09:32.865 --> 09:35.075
Your business model
scares the shit out of me.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.622
What if we increase
the length of the lease?

09:41.540 --> 09:45.169
I don't know.
What happens if there's another recession?

09:47.671 --> 09:48.672
Wow.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.634
Average commercial lease is five years.
We'll guarantee ten.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.137
Are you shittin' me?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.472
You're asking for $90 per square foot?

09:58.724 --> 10:00.058
How about I offer you 130?

10:00.142 --> 10:03.478
Could we get a second order
of the osetra caviar?

10:03.562 --> 10:04.771
I got it.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.363
That was Adam.
We want the whole building.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.783
The whole building?
You know, I have other tenants.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.785
We'll buy them out of their leases.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.089
This is your new business model.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.424
You're going to hurt yourself.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.012
Oh, God. Oh, God. Fuck.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.599
We are on track to lose over 400 million
this year.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.186
Perfect. Lesley, do you know
who else lost money?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.980
Amazon, Uber, Twitter, Spotify, Snapchat.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.982
- Have you heard of those?
- Yes.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.275
Okay. Phil!

10:50.359 --> 10:53.612
Get me a Chinese chicken salad
from Fred's.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.489
It's the cost of rapid growth.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.616
Why does it have to be rapid?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.954
Extra slivered almonds.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.541
These aren't one-off growth expenses.
These are 20-year leases.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.626
We're looking at layoffs.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.338
You don't wanna have to fire people,
right?

11:13.757 --> 11:18.554
And get salads for Miguel and Lesley!
Extra slivered almonds!

11:21.765 --> 11:24.101
Relax, relax.

11:24.685 --> 11:28.772
We'll cut expenses,
scale back on amenities.

11:28.856 --> 11:32.234
The free bagels, the fruit water--

11:32.317 --> 11:34.236
We're not in the red
because of cantaloupe.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.113
I'm sorry.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.659
What she's trying to say, Adam,
is it's not sustainable.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.792
I know what to do.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.504
We need more money.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.715
We need more money?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.176
No-- But, Adam, that's not the point.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.760
Money is always the point.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.096
Okay. Phil!

12:04.641 --> 12:05.893
Adam, is that you?

12:05.976 --> 12:07.895
Yes, it is, baba ghanoush.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.522
- Adam.
- Hey!

12:10.606 --> 12:11.607
- What?
- What happened?

12:11.690 --> 12:13.817
It's for the school
costume party fundraiser.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.319
You're late. We gotta get ready.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.447
Oh, shit. I forgot. I can't. I can't.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.240
- You can't?
- I can't. I can't.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.494
- What?
- I have to meet Bruce. It's an emergency.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.913
- No, Adam.
- Yes.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.915
Adam, no.
I've been planning this for months.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.083
I am on the organizing committee.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.628
- Give them 25 grand.
- No, I already gave them 25 grand.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.421
That's how I got on
the organizing committee!

12:34.505 --> 12:36.131
Then give them 50.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.968
Sweetie, we're a team.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.764
- And we're going to do this together.
- I've got to go. I'm sorry. You look…

12:44.765 --> 12:47.100
You know, it's part of a larger vision.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.311
…disturbing.
Okay, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.188
Have fun!

13:12.918 --> 13:16.338
There's a line.
Fire marshal came a half hour ago.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.548
They're at capacity.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.097
Maybe we overdid it.

13:30.561 --> 13:31.687
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.772
- Elishia.
- Rebekah. You look amazing.

13:33.856 --> 13:37.818
Thanks. Wow, you're really
getting the stink eye from that one.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.445
Never mind, that's just her face.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.823
God, I hope they let us in soon.
I'm starving.

13:44.658 --> 13:48.579
It takes some getting used to
with coming to these things alone.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.913
Who did you use?

13:51.373 --> 13:53.458
- I'm sorry, I don't--
- For the divorce.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.710
I'm not.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.628
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't--
- No. It's fine.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.840
I just-- I thought I saw a familiar look
in the eyes, but I was--

13:59.923 --> 14:02.134
No. No, no, no.
Actually, we're pretty good.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.844
Good. Good, good. Yeah.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.139
It's-- 'Cause divorce can make you mean.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.435
It's like I want him to die,
but I don't want my kids to be sad.

14:11.518 --> 14:16.398
So, like, I'm in a real pickle,
and it just makes me miserable.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.487
Okay, this isn't a popular thing
to say nowadays, apparently,

14:22.571 --> 14:26.408
but… I think that misery's a choice.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.411
You know,
negative feelings come up, absolutely,

14:29.494 --> 14:31.205
but when they come through the door,

14:31.288 --> 14:34.291
you can lovingly choose
to ask them to leave.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.171
Wow.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.424
I weirdly needed to hear that.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.842
You a therapist or…

14:43.926 --> 14:48.680
No, no.
I'm just a serious student of life.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.225
I like that.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.559
Most people roll their eyes.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.521
I'm not rolling my eyes.
No eye-rolling here.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.357
Holy shit!

14:58.440 --> 14:59.608
Make it colder.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.194
Colder!

15:02.277 --> 15:03.403
Negative 292.

15:03.487 --> 15:07.157
I'm raising a new round,
and I'm giving Benchmark first crack.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.952
- Adam.
- It's a crucial time for us, Bruce.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.663
Adam, I'm not gonna give you
more money. Okay?

15:12.746 --> 15:14.998
This is the part where you figure it out.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.752
You act like you're doing us a favor.
I'm giving you an opportunity here, Bruce.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.380
You need to learn the fundamentals.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.716
Good business practices.
Sustainable growth.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.803
Who says our growth
isn't sustainable, Bruce?

15:27.886 --> 15:30.889
- Christ.
- No, no, no. Another minute!

15:31.515 --> 15:35.227
Look, I see the numbers.
I know what you're doing.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.062
Blitzscaling, okay?

15:37.145 --> 15:41.942
Buying market share at all costs is
no way to run a business.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.820
In the new economy,
it's exactly how you run a business.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.363
I can't feel my balls.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.614
That means it's working.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.116
How's the back?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.200
The same.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.329
Adam… focus on what's in front of you.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.084
We at Benchmark,
we don't see ourselves as just the money.

15:59.168 --> 16:03.463
We like to think of ourselves
as bringing something more to the table.

16:04.298 --> 16:08.886
Experience, financial discipline,
maybe even a little wisdom.

16:09.428 --> 16:12.639
We're not speculators.
We don't blitzscale.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.058
We're not SoftBank.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.396
Think about what I said.

16:20.272 --> 16:23.317
Definitely will, Bruce. Definitely will.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.160
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Damian.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.871
Set a meeting for me
with Masayoshi Son at SoftBank.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.290
<i>Are you saying "soff"?
"Soffbank," one word?</i>

16:38.373 --> 16:40.334
Sof-tah! Tah, tah, tah.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.919
How do you not know SoftBank?

16:42.461 --> 16:44.963
- <i>Hey, Adam.</i>
- Phil, put me on a plane to Tokyo.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.840
<i>Adam,
I just checked Masa's Instagram.</i>

16:46.924 --> 16:49.134
- <i>He's not in Tokyo. He's in India.</i>
- What? India?

16:49.218 --> 16:52.346
- <i>Yeah, India for Startup India.</i>
- Startup India?

16:52.429 --> 16:54.973
Get me an invite and a speaking slot.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.393
<i>The conference is happening
as we speak. The schedule is set.</i>

16:58.477 --> 17:01.313
Tell him the founder CEO
of the fastest-growing company

17:01.396 --> 17:03.273
in a 14-trillion-dollar asset class

17:03.357 --> 17:05.233
is willing to come speak
at their shitty conference.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.359
- And, Phil?
- <i>Yes?</i>

17:06.443 --> 17:08.737
Get me everything you can
on Masayoshi Son.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.656
Where he grew up,
how he grew up, biographical information.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.492
Everything and anything. You understand?

17:13.575 --> 17:17.663
And listen to me, both of you.
Put me on a plane to India, immediately.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.789
<i>Where in India?</i>

17:18.872 --> 17:20.999
I don't know where in India.
Figure it out!

17:21.583 --> 17:25.546
Ayn Rand. But isn't there, like,
a lot of anti-feminist stuff in there?

17:25.628 --> 17:27.047
Oh, please, no.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.759
You know, I think people just love
to hate powerful women.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.553
That's not untrue.

17:32.636 --> 17:35.097
I'm sorry. I'm getting a call
from my husband. Do you mind?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.307
- No, no. Take, take.
- Can I just have a-- Thank you.

17:37.391 --> 17:38.475
Hi, love.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.771
No, we haven't. There was a fire marshal,
and he said we couldn't. It was a--

17:43.772 --> 17:46.024
- Wait, what?
- I said I'm headed to India.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.944
Just-- Just for a few days.
I'm in the car to the airport now.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.154
We need funding.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.907
<i>There's an investor there.
An important one.</i>

17:54.491 --> 17:56.118
That's great, love.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.537
No, it's wonderf--

17:59.746 --> 18:01.164
Okay, okay, Adam, but, come--

18:01.248 --> 18:04.418
Remember, it's not about the numbers.
It's about the mission.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.004
- Okay, love you, <i>motek</i>.
- That's what keeps WeWork intentional.

18:07.713 --> 18:08.630
Hello?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.425
All right.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.759
All right. Love you too.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.137
I'm sorry. Thank you.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.848
There's just some really exciting stuff
happening for Adam at WeWork.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.434
Well, I'm not surprised,
with you in his corner.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.727
You're sweet.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.854
No, I mean it. He's so lucky.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.191
Gosh, it must make all the difference
to have a supportive partner.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.485
I mean, Marc, he could not handle it.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.863
It sounds like he really gave in
to his shadow self.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.115
He gave in to his assistant, Cece.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.201
I don't wanna talk about him anymore.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.410
Help me.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.289
I actually know a book
that's about recovering from shadow self.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.583
Fucking assholes.
He's a fucking asshole. Sorry.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.252
- I need that book.
- Okay, it's called <i>Oceans of Grace</i>.

18:47.336 --> 18:48.921
- <i>Oceans of Grace.</i>
- It's really good.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.352
Phil, for Startup India,
I need a plus-one.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.428
Ingrid.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.807
I'm gonna drop Harlow Moon off
at school tomorrow.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.477
Did I do something wrong?

19:51.149 --> 19:55.070
All right, sweetie, have a wonderful day.
I love you so much. Bye.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.867
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.079
Here, here, here.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.958
Have an amazing day.
Learn so much. I love you.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.545
Rebekah.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.339
Elishia, hi.

20:14.423 --> 20:17.050
We never run into each other at drop-off.
And now?

20:17.134 --> 20:19.011
- I know. It must be the universe.
- Yes!

20:19.094 --> 20:21.805
Speaking of which,
I read half of <i>Ocean of Grace</i>.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.932
- Oh, my God, I loved it.
- Do you love it?

20:24.016 --> 20:27.311
It's so good, right?
You need to read <i>Inner Goddess</i> next.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.896
One second. What's that?

20:28.979 --> 20:30.314
- <i>Inner Goddess.</i>
- <i>Inner</i>--

20:30.397 --> 20:32.608
- Blow your mind.
- I have my own guru now.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.526
Thank you.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.362
Rebekah. I got the jade egg.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.072
I'm wearing it right now.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.241
- That's great, Nicole.
- Tell Gwyneth.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.326
Okay.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.706
- She's fine. She just got the jade egg.
- The what?

20:48.290 --> 20:53.420
It's a stone carved
into the shape of an egg that you…

20:55.589 --> 20:57.132
Well, it's meant to strengthen
the pelvic muscles.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.927
And she wants you to tell Gwyneth Paltrow?

21:00.010 --> 21:04.264
Gwyneth is my cousin,
and they know each other from school.

21:04.348 --> 21:07.935
Great. Well, she can wait for the reunion
and tell Gwyneth Paltrow herself.

21:09.478 --> 21:10.854
Do you wanna get a tea?

21:10.938 --> 21:13.565
- I do, but I have to get to work.
- Of course. I understand.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.693
But maybe
we could do, like, a drink tonight?

21:16.777 --> 21:18.070
I'm free.

21:22.950 --> 21:27.955
After raising our Series B
at a $36 million post-money valuation…

21:28.038 --> 21:31.625
Coral reefs all around the world
are struggling to survive.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.335
Our patented technology--

21:33.418 --> 21:34.419
…in a matter of months.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.256
A scalable cloud-native monitoring tool.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.011
- S.
- A.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.054
- A.
- S.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.265
Software as a service.

21:56.567 --> 22:00.195
- <i>Abba!</i>
- Adam. Hey.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.533
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.535
It's good to see you.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.661
This is fantastic.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.038
Well, I love to make an entrance,
you know.

22:10.122 --> 22:13.333
Listen, I'm so thrilled you invited me.
Really.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.502
Let's grab a bite. Okay?

22:15.586 --> 22:16.795
- Okay.
- Grab a bite.

22:16.879 --> 22:18.213
You won't believe my room.

22:18.297 --> 22:21.758
I have my own piano and a private butler
who unpacked my clothes.

22:21.842 --> 22:26.180
And the mini-bar is not mini.
It's the size of my refrigerator at home.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.806
The room, it's nothing.

22:27.890 --> 22:30.517
I got you a private tour at the Taj Mahal.

22:31.101 --> 22:35.355
Well, the thing I'm most excited about is
hearing my son speak.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.908
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the founder CEO of WeWork,</i>

22:45.991 --> 22:47.784
<i>Mr. Adam Neumann.</i>

23:06.553 --> 23:10.098
When I was seven years old,
my parents divorced.

23:13.018 --> 23:16.688
I was devastated, of course.

23:17.189 --> 23:21.610
My sister and I lived with my mother.
We moved 13 times before I turned 18.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.570
Thirteen times.

23:23.654 --> 23:28.116
That's 13 new schools,
13 terrifying first days, 13 moving days,

23:28.200 --> 23:30.327
knowing I had to start all over again.

23:31.620 --> 23:35.499
New friends, new rules, new bullies.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.795
My dad, he wasn't around much.

23:39.878 --> 23:42.965
Money was so tight,
and I was so worried about our finances,

23:43.048 --> 23:46.176
I started paying my mother rent
when I was ten years old.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.681
We finally settled on the kibbutz.

23:51.807 --> 23:54.268
And, I have to say,

23:54.351 --> 23:59.940
it was the first place
that I ever truly felt that I belonged.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.486
All of the kids lived together
in one dorm.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.905
We all ate in the same cafeteria,

24:06.989 --> 24:13.787
and for the first time in my life,
I felt a part of something.

24:16.373 --> 24:21.461
When I moved to New York in my 20s,
I had the opposite experience.

24:21.545 --> 24:25.299
I felt I had moved
to the loneliest place in the world.

24:26.842 --> 24:29.303
All of these people
living so close together

24:29.386 --> 24:30.721
but utterly apart.

24:30.804 --> 24:33.223
Separate. Disconnected.

24:34.224 --> 24:38.687
I thought to myself,
"There must be another way."

24:39.730 --> 24:43.317
WeWork isn't a desk company.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.069
It's not even a shared workspace company.

24:46.153 --> 24:50.032
It is a revolution, a community.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.201
And to be honest,

24:52.743 --> 24:55.996
it's everything I've been searching for
my entire life.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.040
It's been an amazing journey.

24:58.123 --> 25:03.128
I forged incredible new relationships
and repaired old ones.

25:04.588 --> 25:07.508
My father is actually here today.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.930
We're closer now
than-- than we've ever been before.

25:14.389 --> 25:15.682
<i>Abba</i>, wave.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.061
<i>Abba</i>, wave. Wave, <i>Abba. Wave.</i>

25:22.439 --> 25:24.149
Yeah. Yeah.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.824
We are on a mission to end loneliness.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.411
Let me tell you how.

25:41.917 --> 25:45.045
Pretty sure I remember you smiling
once or twice as a kid.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.216
<i>Abba</i>, I don't blame you. Okay?

25:49.299 --> 25:51.301
I believe suffering is a choice.

25:51.385 --> 25:53.762
Then why did you bring me here to hear it?

25:54.346 --> 25:55.931
Or was I just a prop?

25:56.014 --> 25:57.307
It wasn't about you.

25:57.391 --> 25:58.392
Excuse me.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.520
Mr. Neumann.

26:02.980 --> 26:05.899
Your presentation spoke to me.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.192
I appreciate that.

26:07.276 --> 26:08.652
Masayoshi Son.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.195
Adam. Adam Neumann.

26:10.279 --> 26:13.031
Adam. How do you feel about your growth?

26:13.115 --> 26:16.952
Our growth? Unsatisfied.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.496
We should be
three times the size of Amazon.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.290
Good.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.835
Once you get a sense of accomplishment,
growth stops.

26:25.794 --> 26:28.463
But Amazon is a tech company.

26:28.547 --> 26:31.466
Low cost,
infinite potential for expansion.

26:31.550 --> 26:37.222
The potential for expansion
with WeWork is also infinite.

26:38.182 --> 26:41.435
How is a coworking space company "tech"?

26:42.144 --> 26:45.105
Come see WeWork and I'll show you.

26:45.731 --> 26:46.940
Next time I'm in New York.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.235
Perfect. Pleasure.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.654
Pleasure.

26:54.031 --> 26:56.200
- Who was that?
- My audience.

27:04.374 --> 27:05.918
You've really lived.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.961
What?

27:08.045 --> 27:11.298
The acting, the India, the Wall Street.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.509
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm trying to, I don't know,

27:13.592 --> 27:16.512
use all of that
to help build the soul of the company.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.181
Do companies have souls?

27:20.432 --> 27:21.517
Well, ours does.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.103
It does. You're gonna come by,
and you'll see for yourself. Okay?

27:26.271 --> 27:28.732
I mean,
how did you even know about this place?

27:28.815 --> 27:31.485
You know, Adam and I used to come here
in the old days.

27:33.570 --> 27:38.408
Well, too bad, Adam.
This is our place now.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.330
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:44.540 --> 27:45.541
Oh, my God.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.377
Look at those two idiots.

27:50.420 --> 27:54.341
It's like they want you so much
in the beginning, right?

27:54.424 --> 27:56.844
Like they need you. It's intoxicating.

27:56.927 --> 28:01.306
- It ends in disappointment!
- Not always. Stop it.

28:01.390 --> 28:04.601
Listen, I warned you
that the divorce made me a mean bitch.

28:04.685 --> 28:08.272
And angry. And, yeah, bitter.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.356
A little bit bitter.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.734
That's really sad.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.113
I'm sorry. It is.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.282
Yeah, because you still believe in love.

28:18.365 --> 28:22.953
No, because you are brilliant,

28:23.996 --> 28:27.291
beautiful, and you're so kind.

28:27.374 --> 28:29.376
And I'm intuitive.

28:31.211 --> 28:35.215
And you are gonna have
whatever and whoever you want.

28:36.175 --> 28:37.551
You're a supernova.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.095
Cheers to you.

28:41.555 --> 28:43.223
And the sky's the limit.

28:43.307 --> 28:44.474
- To me.
- To you.

28:44.558 --> 28:45.767
- To me!
- To you!

28:45.851 --> 28:47.352
To you!

29:13.045 --> 29:17.007
Good morning, Phil.
Is he ali-- Okay. Good.

29:19.593 --> 29:23.847
- Ingrid, a little help, please.
- I wanna be barefoot like Daddy!

29:23.931 --> 29:26.350
Hi. Your daughter's refusing
to wear shoes. How's India?

29:27.726 --> 29:30.145
- You're back? What?
- Let's go, kids. Come on.

29:30.229 --> 29:33.148
- Where-- Why aren't you home?
- One more kiss. Let's go.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.735
Mrs. Neumann,
are you taking Harlow to school?

29:37.986 --> 29:39.279
What? No.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.285
SAAS? What is SAAS?

29:45.369 --> 29:46.620
Software as a service.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.705
Space as a service.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.290
Pretty sure it's "software."

29:50.374 --> 29:51.416
And now it's "space."

29:51.500 --> 29:53.544
It's our pivot into tech.

29:53.627 --> 29:56.421
Masa's Vision Fund invests
in tech companies.

29:56.505 --> 29:59.550
Are you--
Masayoshi Son is investing in us?

29:59.633 --> 30:01.426
Not yet. But he will.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.929
Susan, I want you to hire engineers.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.472
What kind?

30:06.682 --> 30:07.683
All of the kinds.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.980
Adam, you were supposed to be
getting us funding.

30:13.897 --> 30:15.941
But now you're telling us to spend more?

30:16.024 --> 30:18.902
Miguel, we spend to grow.
We spend to grow.

30:18.986 --> 30:21.947
You understand?
Now is not the time to think small.

30:22.614 --> 30:25.701
The moment you are satisfied,
growth stops.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.619
Adam, when you hired me,

30:27.703 --> 30:30.205
you asked me
to come build tomorrow with you.

30:30.289 --> 30:31.999
I'm sorry, this is not how you do that.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.668
Well, Lesley, this is WeWork's future.

30:34.751 --> 30:37.713
If you can't see it,
you're welcome to leave.

30:37.796 --> 30:39.756
Susan, engineers.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.843
Okay. Okay. Damian!

30:44.428 --> 30:45.512
Damian!

30:46.430 --> 30:47.598
- Damian!
- Yeah?

30:47.681 --> 30:51.143
Offer <i>Wired</i> magazine an exclusive look
inside WeWork Labs.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.227
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:52.936 --> 30:55.939
Adam, what is WeWork Labs?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.494
- Hello?
- <i>I'm in New York.</i>

31:09.578 --> 31:11.705
<i>I'll be at your office in 15 minutes.</i>

31:12.456 --> 31:14.750
Perfect. Perfect. See you soon.

31:14.833 --> 31:15.959
See you soon, Masa.

31:16.543 --> 31:17.544
Phil!

31:24.218 --> 31:26.428
Attention! Attention!

31:26.512 --> 31:29.348
A very important tour is about to begin.

31:29.431 --> 31:32.059
And we need to help him understand--

31:32.142 --> 31:37.439
to feel that special WeWork energy.

31:37.523 --> 31:38.732
That spirit.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.865
And everyone gets 100 shares, okay?

31:48.575 --> 31:52.746
Okay, I'll need to move
a few of you around, so bear with me.

31:52.829 --> 31:55.165
You, you, you, you. What's your name?

31:55.249 --> 31:56.416
Brian.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.501
- What?
- Brian.

31:57.584 --> 32:01.004
Brian? Brian. And--
And what department are you in?

32:01.088 --> 32:02.172
I don't work here.

32:02.256 --> 32:03.340
- Phil.
- Yeah?

32:03.423 --> 32:04.591
He works here now.

32:04.675 --> 32:05.676
- Hi, Brian.
- Sit here.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.052
- Okay.
- Sit.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.720
You, stand, please.

32:08.804 --> 32:10.430
And you're laughing.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.643
Laughter from the gut.
From the gut.

32:16.395 --> 32:17.396
Phil.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.858
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not a mental hospital.

32:20.941 --> 32:23.652
Phil, show them how to laugh, please.

32:23.735 --> 32:24.736
Like Phil laughs. Go.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.157
And you two, you can be a couple.

32:29.241 --> 32:30.701
Are you dating?

32:30.784 --> 32:32.953
You should be. You'd make a great couple.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.788
Show me your face of love.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.461
Throuple. You're a throuple. Here. Here.
No, no, no. Sit here. Lounge, lay.

32:41.545 --> 32:43.505
Chess. Phil, coffee for all.

32:43.589 --> 32:46.758
And everyone, please listen to me.
Very important tour.

32:46.842 --> 32:52.097
And we will activate this space
with energy, with compassion.

32:52.181 --> 32:53.265
Do what you love.

32:53.348 --> 32:54.474
<i>Lehayim!</i> Yes.

32:54.558 --> 32:55.809
- Cheers. Please.
- Cheers!

32:55.893 --> 32:57.394
- Phil, time.
- Three minutes.

32:57.477 --> 32:58.854
We need someone dancing.

33:00.814 --> 33:01.857
One minute.

33:01.940 --> 33:05.819
Spirited energy.
Love, passion, creativity.

33:05.903 --> 33:09.448
Foosball.
The winner gets another 100 shares.

33:09.531 --> 33:11.158
But, please, what's your name?

33:11.241 --> 33:13.660
- Holly.
- Come with me now, Holly, please.

33:13.744 --> 33:16.914
Okay. Here.
Stand, stand, stand here. You're the--

33:22.044 --> 33:24.171
His office called. He had to reschedule.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.591
Energy's great in here.

33:33.472 --> 33:34.473
You want to see it?

33:35.057 --> 33:36.725
Yes. Yes.

33:38.352 --> 33:39.353
What?

33:42.105 --> 33:43.815
<i>I could make do with that.</i>

33:44.608 --> 33:45.984
<i>What do I write back?</i>

33:46.652 --> 33:47.861
"New phone. Who's this?"

33:47.945 --> 33:49.279
<i>Shut up.</i>

33:53.075 --> 33:55.202
The numbers are not pretty, guys.

33:55.285 --> 34:00.123
See? There's no accounting voodoo
that's gonna fix this.

34:00.207 --> 34:04.461
You can't spend more on rent,
commit us to longer lease terms--

34:04.545 --> 34:06.880
- And membership discounts.
- Exactly.

34:07.714 --> 34:10.926
We could sit here all day.
It's not gonna change the math.

34:11.927 --> 34:13.178
You have to talk to Adam.

34:16.181 --> 34:18.891
Maybe we just go over the numbers
one more time.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.396
The numbers don't change.
That's not how this works.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.690
Miguel, we-- we have to do something.

34:25.774 --> 34:28.150
Yeah, but we have to spend to grow.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.571
That is not a plan.
That is a bumper sticker.

34:31.864 --> 34:35.242
Yeah, well, we're--
we're not stopping our growth, so--

34:38.745 --> 34:40.371
What the fuck are you doing?

34:41.456 --> 34:45.127
If you're a visual learner,
I thought this might help explain things.

34:46.503 --> 34:49.715
Okay. Somebody just pitch me
something, guys.

34:49.797 --> 34:53.467
Come on. We're-- We're spending
thousands of dollars on your services, so…

34:56.388 --> 34:57.389
pitch.

34:58.140 --> 34:59.516
That's not really our role.

35:02.102 --> 35:03.228
Layoffs.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.230
Fuck you, Matthew.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.983
Sorry to offend
your delicate sensibilities,

35:08.066 --> 35:10.694
but if he's too afraid
to talk to his cofounder…

35:10.777 --> 35:11.778
Fuck you, Matthew.

35:11.862 --> 35:14.948
…and we just keep spending and spending
like drunken sailors,

35:15.032 --> 35:17.075
then there's not a lot of options here.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.036
Ergo, layoffs.

35:20.829 --> 35:22.414
Nobody is getting laid off.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.710
If Adam heard you saying that,
he'd fire you.

35:26.793 --> 35:29.171
So, pitch me something.

35:30.506 --> 35:33.175
48,000 square feet,
right on Hollywood Boulevard…

35:33.258 --> 35:34.635
Masa's on his way.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.349
Activate the space!

35:41.141 --> 35:44.144
Get into positions.
The positions I showed you before.

35:44.228 --> 35:45.896
That's what "activate the space" means.

35:50.943 --> 35:51.944
Rescheduled.

35:57.783 --> 35:58.951
Hey.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.495
How was your day?

36:22.599 --> 36:28.689
Arlington build-out, 4.9 million.
Denver build-out, 6.3 million.

36:28.772 --> 36:32.734
San Diego build-out, 8.2 million.

36:32.818 --> 36:36.238
- Member acquisition costs for Arlington--
- How-- How long do we have?

36:36.822 --> 36:39.908
Well, we're looking at--
What do you think, John? I think that--

36:39.992 --> 36:41.660
I'll take this one, geniuses.

36:41.743 --> 36:42.744
We're bleeding out,

36:42.828 --> 36:46.290
and we need a transfusion of cash, stat,
or we're gonna flatline.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.500
Or we chop off a limb.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.295
How long do we have?

36:51.378 --> 36:54.631
Just tell me what year and what quarter.

36:55.382 --> 36:58.468
It's not years, Miguel.
We're-- We're talking months.

37:10.689 --> 37:13.859
Activate the space! Activate the space!

37:16.528 --> 37:19.740
Adam, we need to talk.

37:23.660 --> 37:28.248
Adam, we talked about
this time might be coming,

37:28.332 --> 37:32.211
and it's-- It seems to be here. I mean--

37:34.796 --> 37:38.050
Adam, the company is
at a critical juncture.

37:38.133 --> 37:41.887
You have two options.
One, you close 12 locations immediately.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.805
That's not going to happen.

37:43.889 --> 37:47.309
Two, you shut down
all nonessential operations.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.394
That includes WeWork Labs.

37:49.478 --> 37:51.438
Absolutely not.

37:51.522 --> 37:53.565
Well, those are your options.

37:53.649 --> 37:56.109
- Richard--
- You're-- You're too soft on him, Bruce.

37:56.193 --> 37:58.862
Those are your options. Period.

38:01.949 --> 38:05.035
- Hi. Welcome to WeWork.
- Hi, Rebekah.

38:05.118 --> 38:07.120
Oh, my God. You look amazing.

38:07.204 --> 38:09.748
I'm so excited to finally see it.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.708
Good. So, I was thinking
I'd give you a quick tour…

38:11.792 --> 38:13.585
- Yes, please.
- …then we walk to Little Prince.

38:13.669 --> 38:17.172
Him? He's going to tell me my options

38:17.256 --> 38:20.300
in my conference room in our company?

38:20.384 --> 38:22.427
You're telling me what my options are?

38:22.511 --> 38:24.263
This is where we are, yeah.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.223
- Listen to me.
- Adam, look at me.

38:26.723 --> 38:28.684
It's been four months since India.

38:29.601 --> 38:31.103
Masa's just not coming.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.438
Look at all of this.

38:33.522 --> 38:36.525
It actually reminds me
of the early days of my company.

38:36.608 --> 38:37.609
- Does it?
- Yeah.

38:37.693 --> 38:38.944
That's so gratifying to hear.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.529
And here is Adam.

38:41.530 --> 38:42.990
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

38:43.073 --> 38:44.908
- Hey, love.
- <i>Motek</i>!

38:44.992 --> 38:47.744
Hi. I just wanted to introduce you
to my friend.

38:47.828 --> 38:50.205
- Elishia Kennedy. Wow.
- Yes.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.332
- Big fan of your company, Ms. Kennedy.
- Wow.

38:52.416 --> 38:54.960
Do you have any idea
how many recruiters we've gone through

38:55.043 --> 38:57.087
trying to lure you over here?

38:57.171 --> 38:59.882
To what miracle do we owe
the honor of your presence?

38:59.965 --> 39:03.302
Well, Adam, this is my new friend,
Elishia, I've been telling you about.

39:03.385 --> 39:05.929
She came to see me.
And, you know, I was showing her--

39:06.013 --> 39:09.933
Of course. Of course,
she came to see my magical wife.

39:10.684 --> 39:12.019
Of course. Of course.

39:12.102 --> 39:17.941
But now that you're here,
you can't help but feel it, hey?

39:18.025 --> 39:20.611
- Just a bit. A tiny little bit.
- More than a little bit.

39:20.694 --> 39:24.198
- It's amazing. It's-- This is amazing.
- Okay, great. Yes, it's amazing.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.742
But like I said
to all of those recruiters,

39:26.825 --> 39:29.119
I have a job at my own company.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.705
The very successful one.
Maybe you should offer him a job.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.124
But I am not offering her a job.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.294
Oh, well, then what do you--
What are you asking me?

39:41.089 --> 39:42.174
Are you lonely?

39:44.259 --> 39:46.011
- I'm sorry. Adam…
- What?

39:46.094 --> 39:49.765
I'm-- I'm just-- just asking
if-- if you're lonely.

39:49.848 --> 39:52.976
- Adam, it's--
- No, no, no. It's just a question. It--

39:56.063 --> 39:59.566
Everyone's lonely.
It's a-- This is a lonely world.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.531
I agree. I do.

40:05.614 --> 40:08.784
And that is why
I wasn't offering you a job.

40:10.202 --> 40:14.748
I'm offering you a mission
to reach billions,

40:14.831 --> 40:19.211
to create a global community
that will bring happiness and connectivity

40:19.294 --> 40:22.297
to people around the globe.
You understand?

40:22.381 --> 40:27.219
And to make the world
a little less lonely.

40:27.886 --> 40:30.180
Right here, right now.

40:30.264 --> 40:33.350
His best and worst quality
is never taking "no" for an answer.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.686
And I haven't heard a "no" yet.

40:39.189 --> 40:41.149
Don't you have to
run that by your board?

40:41.233 --> 40:42.901
I am the board.

40:46.363 --> 40:47.865
- I will think about that.
- Yes.

40:47.948 --> 40:50.033
We should go. We have a reservation.

41:01.420 --> 41:02.629
Is Adam for real?

41:05.674 --> 41:07.342
I wouldn't be with him if he wasn't.

41:09.428 --> 41:12.431
Where were we?
You were telling me my options.

41:12.514 --> 41:13.891
You gave me two.

41:15.684 --> 41:16.935
I'll take number three.

41:29.573 --> 41:31.283
I just got fired.

41:32.451 --> 41:33.452
Me too.

41:44.171 --> 41:45.923
<i>To rock a rhyme, that's right on time</i>

41:46.006 --> 41:47.633
- <i>It's Tricky, Tricky, Tricky</i>
- <i>Here we go!</i>

41:47.716 --> 41:49.593
<i>It's tricky to rock a rhyme</i>

41:49.676 --> 41:51.386
<i>To rock a rhyme that's right on time</i>

41:51.470 --> 41:53.889
You just fired 7% of the company

41:53.972 --> 41:56.767
but decided to spend thousands of dollars
on Run-DMC?

41:57.351 --> 42:00.521
A very normal part of our growth phase.

42:01.980 --> 42:05.901
Besides, we can afford it now.
And everybody needs a morale boost.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.110
Everybody needs a job!

42:07.903 --> 42:10.572
Lesley, you were
one of our first employees,

42:10.656 --> 42:12.950
so I've always felt
a certain affection for you.

42:13.033 --> 42:16.453
But if anyone else were
to speak to me that way, they'd be fired.

42:17.454 --> 42:19.206
Be careful. There are limits.

42:19.831 --> 42:21.583
- I'm going up.
- Be careful?

42:24.795 --> 42:26.839
And you, you're just along for the ride.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.510
<i>And in the city it's a pity
'Cause we just can't hide</i>

42:31.593 --> 42:35.389
<i>Tinted windows don't mean nothin'
They know who's inside</i>

42:35.472 --> 42:37.266
<i>It's tricky to rock a rhyme</i>

42:37.349 --> 42:39.351
<i>To rock a rhyme that's right on time</i>

42:39.434 --> 42:40.727
<i>It's tricky</i>

42:40.811 --> 42:43.063
<i>Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky</i>

42:56.451 --> 42:57.703
Fuck this.

43:09.882 --> 43:11.884
<i>Harlow Moon, wanna say
what you're thankful for?</i>

43:12.467 --> 43:17.014
I'm thankful for my friends
and Froggy the frog.

43:18.223 --> 43:21.977
- Cool.
- And I am grateful for Elishia Kennedy.

43:22.936 --> 43:25.022
I landed her. Yeah.

43:25.105 --> 43:28.108
- Oh, she didn't tell me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good, yeah? Yeah.

43:28.192 --> 43:30.736
- Well, that-- Yeah.
- That's-- Wow.

43:30.819 --> 43:32.154
She said she was busy at work.

43:32.237 --> 43:35.365
She didn't say she was leaving her company
to join WeWork. That's huge.

43:35.449 --> 43:37.993
She said your passion for the company
was a big reason

43:38.076 --> 43:40.037
for wanting to make the change,
so thank you.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.540
I'm making her Chief Brand Officer.

43:43.624 --> 43:46.126
Yes. Yes.

43:46.210 --> 43:48.545
Daddy, Mommy didn't say
what she's grateful for.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.091
Please, Rivka,
say what you're thankful for.

43:53.175 --> 43:54.343
Starving here.

43:55.010 --> 43:56.929
Everyone start, please.
I've lost my appetite.

43:57.596 --> 43:59.806
- I get one night a week of meat.
- I know.

43:59.890 --> 44:01.141
One night a week.

44:01.225 --> 44:05.479
I can't help it if it turns my stomach
watching you ingest an animal's fear.

44:05.562 --> 44:08.815
It's a chicken, okay? It's a chicken.
It doesn't have fear.

44:08.899 --> 44:10.484
It's a living creature. Living creatures…

44:10.567 --> 44:12.903
- Definitely no fear.
- …have fear and powerlessness.

44:12.986 --> 44:15.155
All living creatures have fear
and powerlessness.

44:15.239 --> 44:17.908
Sometimes people forget that.
Do you mind-- Excuse me.

44:17.991 --> 44:20.827
But-- But you did not say
what you're grateful for.

44:22.287 --> 44:24.915
Here. Take this.

44:24.998 --> 44:26.291
Don't tell your mother.

44:26.875 --> 44:27.876
I am.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.212
Okay. Cheers.

44:30.295 --> 44:33.549
<i>Hi. You've reached Elishia Kennedy.
I'm not available to answer the phone…</i>

44:34.591 --> 44:36.677
I'll get you a pizza too.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.887
- No.
- Yes, I am.

44:43.559 --> 44:44.560
It's Masa. He's here.

44:44.643 --> 44:45.519
- Now?
- Now!

44:53.902 --> 44:58.574
Masa. Masa. Thank you for making the time.
How long do you have?

45:00.200 --> 45:01.451
Twelve minutes.

45:02.119 --> 45:05.330
Twelve minutes. I can't wait
to show you the future of work.

45:05.414 --> 45:07.165
Come. Come. So good to have you here.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.441
I call it "space as a service."

45:32.524 --> 45:36.570
We're building data systems
to connect communities around the world--

45:42.284 --> 45:43.660
You don't wear shoes?

45:48.373 --> 45:49.374
No.

45:58.258 --> 45:59.259
You're crazy.

46:00.594 --> 46:01.595
Ride with me.

46:04.181 --> 46:08.185
We currently have
one million square feet of WeWork space--

46:10.103 --> 46:11.813
I don't want to see your deck.

46:13.482 --> 46:14.942
I don't look for companies.

46:15.943 --> 46:17.361
I look for founders.

46:22.074 --> 46:26.286
I was born in a tiny province in Japan
to Korean immigrants.

46:27.496 --> 46:31.917
We adopted a Japanese surname,
but it didn't matter.

46:32.835 --> 46:35.379
Everyone knew we were outsiders.

46:36.088 --> 46:39.383
When I was 16,
I moved to the United States,

46:39.466 --> 46:42.386
and it was no different.

46:44.596 --> 46:48.767
I have faced great discrimination
in my life…

46:50.435 --> 46:51.937
and great loneliness.

46:54.273 --> 46:56.024
But you know all this.

46:56.108 --> 46:58.819
That's why you gave the speech you gave
at Startup India.

46:58.902 --> 46:59.903
Well, I--

47:01.530 --> 47:05.033
When you hit an obstacle, do not mourn it.

47:05.117 --> 47:09.204
Because it provides growth opportunities.

47:32.477 --> 47:34.897
Rivka, why are you sitting in the dark?

47:35.731 --> 47:37.983
I wanted to catch you before you got high.

47:40.736 --> 47:41.945
Our first date…

47:44.239 --> 47:45.741
there were so many red flags.

47:47.826 --> 47:48.827
You saw me.

47:51.288 --> 47:55.083
You looked across the table,
and you saw me, right?

47:56.460 --> 48:00.714
Elishia asked me if you were for real.

48:02.341 --> 48:03.342
I told her yes.

48:03.425 --> 48:07.804
But I didn't tell her
how many nights I lie in bed alone,

48:07.888 --> 48:09.681
wondering if I made you up.

48:18.148 --> 48:19.358
Where are you?

48:21.318 --> 48:22.486
'Cause you're not here.

48:27.115 --> 48:28.283
You're my life.

48:30.410 --> 48:34.540
This family is my life, and we're yours.
Do you understand that?

48:34.623 --> 48:36.458
Nothing is more important than us.

48:36.542 --> 48:39.920
I understand. I understand. I do.

48:41.964 --> 48:43.549
And I'm here.

48:45.884 --> 48:46.927
Uh-huh.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.721
Why won't you look at me?

48:51.682 --> 48:53.809
Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you touch me?

48:53.892 --> 48:57.896
- Why won't you look at our children?
- Rivka. Rivka, please. Please.

48:57.980 --> 49:00.524
- Listen. Listen, let me explain.
- I can't, Adam. I can't.

49:00.607 --> 49:02.484
- Take a look. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

49:02.568 --> 49:04.403
- Please. Look. Look.
- What? What is this?

49:07.614 --> 49:10.200
It's Masa's investment in WeWork.

49:14.538 --> 49:15.539
And us.

49:20.419 --> 49:22.171
I manifested it.

49:27.467 --> 49:30.095
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:30.179 --> 49:32.556
It's for you, okay? It's for you.

49:32.639 --> 49:34.099
It's always been for you.

49:36.435 --> 49:37.519
Hey.
