00:02.070 --> 00:02.762
Kites, ho!

00:04.920 --> 00:06.102
ALL:
Kites, ho!

00:07.279 --> 00:08.262
Excuse me.

00:08.349 --> 00:10.096
You're misusing the word "ho."

00:11.486 --> 00:13.296
It's an interjection used
to call attention

00:13.375 --> 00:16.520
To a destination, not an object,
as in, uh, "Land, ho!"

00:16.601 --> 00:18.167
Or, uh, "Westward, ho!"

00:21.507 --> 00:22.500
ALL:
Kites, ho!

00:24.357 --> 00:25.943
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doin'?

00:26.455 --> 00:27.836
Going out to discover
electricity?

00:29.802 --> 00:31.501
If you're referring to the work
of Benjamin Franklin,

00:31.557 --> 00:33.448
He did not
"discover electricity,"

00:33.546 --> 00:35.060
He merely used a kite
to determine

00:35.166 --> 00:37.109
That lightning "consists"
of electricity.

00:37.665 --> 00:39.098
Also invented
the Franklin stove,

00:39.177 --> 00:41.387
Bifocals and the flexie
urinary catheter.

00:45.339 --> 00:46.152
Kites, ho.

00:47.846 --> 00:49.219
We're heading out
for some kite fighting.

00:49.322 --> 00:50.845
"Kite ghting"?
Oh, yeah.

00:50.941 --> 00:53.377
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthrt sport.

00:54.698 --> 00:57.533
Well, actually, the risk of
throat cutting is very low.

00:58.497 --> 01:00.496
On the other hand,
severe string burn is a real

01:00.596 --> 01:01.936
And ever-Present danger.

01:03.606 --> 01:04.879
You want to come watch?

01:05.420 --> 01:06.706
, gee...

01:06.799 --> 01:08.288
Sounds amazing.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.543
But, um, I've got some
friends coming over.

01:10.629 --> 01:11.783
Not a big thing--
We're just

01:11.838 --> 01:12.982
Gonna watch the Nebraska game.

01:13.047 --> 01:14.914
Oh. Football, sure.

01:15.256 --> 01:16.334
(Sotto ve):
Good guess.

01:19.152 --> 01:21.118
I would've invited you, but I
know you're not a footbl fan.

01:21.194 --> 01:23.672
, no, I'm not, so... great.

01:24.401 --> 01:25.169
You've got plans

01:25.259 --> 01:27.114
Doing something you like,
I've got plans

01:27.193 --> 01:28.855
Doing something I like,
so 's good.

01:28.942 --> 01:30.448
Well, maybe we'll hang out
later--

01:30.527 --> 01:31.572
You know,
after everybody's gone.

01:31.653 --> 01:32.480
Yeah, great.

01:33.212 --> 01:34.217
See ya.

01:38.575 --> 01:39.474
Well, this sucks.

01:41.410 --> 01:43.375
I'm sorry, I got bored
and drifted off.

01:46.075 --> 01:48.418
Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

01:50.074 --> 01:52.224
Leonard just realized that
Penny's been hiding him

01:52.290 --> 01:53.884
From her friends
because he's a tiny, little man

01:53.953 --> 01:55.065
Who flies kites.

01:57.264 --> 01:58.611
Oh, that certainly would suck.

02:00.736 --> 02:03.756
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

02:03.881 --> 02:07.788
*hen nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

02:07.859 --> 02:09.179
* T Earth began to cool

02:09.227 --> 02:11.969

Neanderthals developed too *

02:12.051 --> 02:13.912

02:28.502 --> 02:30.047
Wolowitz is trying
to outflank us.

02:30.113 --> 02:32.130
Let out some string,
add altitude

02:32.204 --> 02:33.607
And I'll go under
and cut his line.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.397
Why wouldn't Penny want
her friends to meet me?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.175
Focus, Leonard, focus!

02:38.252 --> 02:39.683
The heat of battle is upon us.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.181
The dogs of war are unleashed.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.735
Maybe Koothrappali's right.

02:43.801 --> 02:45.008
Maybe I embarrass her.

02:45.063 --> 02:46.566
You're embarrassing me
right now.

02:46.652 --> 02:49.200
A grown man woying
about such nonsense

02:49.275 --> 02:50.464
When in the middle
of flying kites.

02:53.143 --> 02:53.793
Sorry.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.328
Sorry won't bring
their kites down.

02:56.151 --> 02:56.800
Ow!

02:56.860 --> 02:57.998
String burn!
String burn!

03:00.658 --> 03:02.559
Oh, they thinkwe're flanking

03:03.280 --> 03:04.459
They're playing
righ into our hands.

03:04.530 --> 03:07.084
On the count of three,
we execute the flying scissor.

03:07.148 --> 03:08.854
One, two...

03:08.928 --> 03:09.967
Whoa!

03:10.620 --> 03:11.873
Did you see that?
See what?

03:11.960 --> 03:13.787
That chick--
She smiled at me.

03:13.956 --> 03:15.128
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did.

03:15.206 --> 03:16.490
Come on,
scissors, scissors!

03:16.557 --> 03:18.109
Hold my line.
Wait.

03:18.174 --> 03:18.895
What are you doing?

03:18.952 --> 03:20.201
I can't scissors by myself!
Howard!

03:20.257 --> 03:21.404
Come back!

03:22.390 --> 03:23.818
SHELDON:
Victory!

03:24.791 --> 03:26.446
Son of a bitch.

03:29.907 --> 03:31.492
You're a sucky friend,
you know that?

03:32.514 --> 03:33.876
<i>A sucky, sucky friend.</i>

03:34.852 --> 03:36.242
What was supposed to do?

03:36.316 --> 03:38.328
She gave me that
"come-Hither" look.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.291
If she gave you
any look at l. It
was a "you suck" look.

03:43.881 --> 03:46.649
I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

03:46.717 --> 03:48.344
Oh, please,
you weh 80 pounds.

03:48.421 --> 03:49.592
You don't have a hammy.

03:50.995 --> 03:52.736
So, Penny doesn't want
around her friends.

03:52.801 --> 03:54.310
I embarrass her.
Whatlse could it be?

03:54.912 --> 03:56.825
Well, her actions

03:56.905 --> 03:58.638
Could be out of concernfor your feelings

03:59.235 --> 04:01.336
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings

04:01.425 --> 04:03.181
Because she's scouting
for a new mate

04:03.273 --> 04:04.732
And don't want to do it
in front of you.

04:06.387 --> 04:08.704
Oh... how kind of her.

04:09.492 --> 04:10.351
Agreed.

04:10.426 --> 04:12.576
Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

04:12.690 --> 04:16.704
A female bonobo will
copulate with a new male
front of the old one

04:16.774 --> 04:18.374
Without so much
as a "hodo you do?"

04:19.654 --> 04:20.939
You always do this,
you know?

04:21.029 --> 04:23.060
You ditch me for a woman
u don't have a shot with.

04:23.124 --> 04:25.066
I totally had a shot.
With a woman

04:25.148 --> 04:26.329
You were chasi
through a park--

04:26.396 --> 04:27.914
That's not a shot,
that's a felony.

04:30.314 --> 04:36.112
What's worse, it cost me
my prized Patang fighting kite.
Sheldon, I don't suppose

04:36.172 --> 04:38.021
There's any chance you
could give me my kite back?

04:38.078 --> 04:41.074
I'm sorry, Raj, but
the rules of aerial warfare

04:41.154 --> 04:43.568
Dictate at the fallen
kite go to the victor.

04:43.633 --> 04:46.142
And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.

04:46.234 --> 04:47.501
And without meaning,

04:47.587 --> 04:49.250
The following would
be an empty gesture.

04:49.859 --> 04:52.864
(Tauing):
I have your kite.
I have your kite.

05:00.557 --> 05:01.755
(Knocking at door)

05:02.433 --> 05:03.457
Hey.
Hi.

05:03.539 --> 05:04.978
How was your football party?

05:05.061 --> 05:06.926
It was prettgood.
We won.
Oh, wow.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.056
That's excellent.

05:08.589 --> 05:10.455
It's a weird figure of speech,
isn't it

05:10.558 --> 05:12.356
"We won" when you weren't
actually playing.

05:14.332 --> 05:15.389
<i>When we watch Star Wars,</i>

05:15.477 --> 05:17.128
We don't say,
"We defeated the Empire."

05:19.411 --> 05:22.194
I'm glad to hear it.
Yeah.

05:22.311 --> 05:23.793
Oh, hey, on a related subject,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.586
Are you embarrassed
to have me around your friends?

05:27.772 --> 05:29.010
Oh, my god, no.

05:29.534 --> 05:30.658
Why would you ask that?

05:30.735 --> 05:32.476
Well, you know, I just noticed

05:32.532 --> 05:34.930
Sure you have.N't really
met any of them.Well...

05:35.550 --> 05:38.338
Yeah, no, I met
the huge ex-Boyfriend

05:38.421 --> 05:45.281
And the smBy the way,till larger
were they here today?

05:45.865 --> 05:46.923
Of course not.
Of course not.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.276
Why would they be?
Whwould I ask?

05:48.364 --> 05:49.917
Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

05:51.528 --> 05:52.475
Leonard, look,

05:52.535 --> 05:54.433
If you want to meet my friends,
that would be great.

05:54.523 --> 05:56.918
I just, you know, I didn't
want you to be bored.

05:57.850 --> 05:58.762
I wouldn't be bored.

05:58.852 --> 06:00.515
Why would I be bored?
Well,

06:00.635 --> 06:02.300
'Cause they're
not genius scientists.

06:03.216 --> 06:05.085
Penny, I like all
sorts of people.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.172
In fact, some ofmy best friends
aren't geniuses.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.584
Like who?

06:14.065 --> 06:16.601
Okay, some of my Facebook
friends aren't geniuses.

06:17.691 --> 06:20.117
My point is, if we're
going to be a couple,

06:20.204 --> 06:22.110
I should be friends
with your friends.

06:22.190 --> 06:24.130
Okay, great.
Well, then why don't you

06:24.184 --> 06:25.839
Come over next Saturday
and watch the game with us.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.777
Another football game?

06:28.816 --> 06:30.538
They have them every week.

06:31.029 --> 06:31.916
Did not know that.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.495
You wanted to meet my friends.
Sure.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.580
Su, just I don't know
much about football.

06:37.649 --> 06:39.051
Oh, that's okay--
A lot of the guys'

06:39.121 --> 06:40.315
Girlfries don't know football.

06:40.373 --> 06:42.090
They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.480
Great.

06:48.515 --> 06:50.698
(Football game playing on TV)

06:50.763 --> 06:52.485
Okay, a completepass.

06:53.797 --> 06:55.190
First down, New England.

06:57.665 --> 06:59.083
I think I'm starting
to get this.

06:59.707 --> 07:00.583
Really?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.161
The only thing I've learned
in the last two hours

07:02.239 --> 07:03.819
Is that American men
love drinking beer,

07:03.883 --> 07:06.283
Pee too often and have
trouble getting erections.

07:11.204 --> 07:13.279
Focus on the game,
not the commercials, Raj.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.512
I'm just saying,
maybe if you people
cut back on the beer,

07:16.617 --> 07:20.305
You could get out of the
bathroom and satisfy your women
without pharmaceutical hp.

07:23.299 --> 07:24.927
J, what are you
doing here?

07:24.994 --> 07:26.513
You were supposed to help me
pimp outy Vespa.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.729
I'm sorry, are you
under the impreson
that we're still friends?

07:30.819 --> 07:33.359
(Groans):
Ohcome on.

07:33.939 --> 07:36.230
Y're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

07:36.337 --> 07:38.005
It's not just the kite thing.

07:38.111 --> 07:40.364
Every time we go some place,
you think you can just dump me

07:40.434 --> 07:41.665
Whenever someone prettier
comes along,

07:41.752 --> 07:43.186
Even though you don't have
a shot with them.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.408
I had a shot with that jogger.

07:45.510 --> 07:48.819
Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

07:50.649 --> 07:52.273
It's not a little scooter.

07:52.335 --> 07:54.331
It's the second biggest
Vespa they make!

07:54.411 --> 07:55.579
(Door closes)

07:57.771 --> 07:59.339
Are you watching football?

07:59.923 --> 08:01.247
There's no fooling you.

08:03.265 --> 08:06.588
Now, what is this sacks
statistic they put up there?

08:06.674 --> 08:09.271
All I know about Saks is,
my mother shops there.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.252
Sacks, sacks...

08:15.348 --> 08:16.760
SHELDON:It's football nom

08:16.815 --> 08:18.517
For when a quarterback
is taced

08:18.587 --> 08:20.012
Behind the line of scrimmage.

08:20.142 --> 08:21.315
Huh...

08:23.937 --> 08:25.040
Scrimmage.

08:27.242 --> 08:28.165
SHELDON:
The line of scrimmage

08:28.269 --> 08:30.012
Is the imaginary transverse line

08:30.060 --> 08:31.951
Separating the offense
from the defense.

08:33.105 --> 08:33.912
Oh.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.265
Sheln knows football?

08:37.898 --> 08:39.054
Apparently.

08:39.181 --> 08:41.919
I mean, Quidditch, sure.
But football?

08:45.206 --> 08:46.578
Sheldon, how do you
know this stuff?

08:46.665 --> 08:48.022
I grew up in Texas.

08:48.142 --> 08:49.809
Football is ubiquitous in Texas:

08:50.497 --> 08:52.103
Pro football,
college football,

08:52.186 --> 08:54.097
High school football,
peewee football...

08:54.189 --> 08:56.807
In fact, every form of football
except the original--

08:56.872 --> 08:58.506
Europeanootball.

08:59.533 --> 09:01.474
Which most Texans believe
to be a Commie plot.

09:04.155 --> 09:05.016
Unbeliable.

09:05.118 --> 09:07.321
If you're interested, Ilso
know all about frying meat

09:07.427 --> 09:09.274
That isn't icken
as if it were chicken.

09:13.527 --> 09:15.186
So you could teach me?

09:16.148 --> 09:18.189
Football or chicken-Fried meats?

09:20.154 --> 09:21.036
Football.

09:21.109 --> 09:23.288
I'm going to Penny's on Saturday
to watch a game with her friends

09:23.376 --> 09:25.698
And I don't want to look lik
an idiot. I want to blend in.

09:25.762 --> 09:27.538
If you want to blend in
with Penny's friends,

09:27.637 --> 09:29.799
I'd think looking ke an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

09:31.611 --> 09:33.892
Come on, Sheldon, please teach
me about football. It'll be fun.

09:34.010 --> 09:36.387
That's exactly
what my father said.

09:37.297 --> 09:39.128
"Come to the games.
watch the games."

09:39.224 --> 09:41.112
Week in and week out
from the time

09:41.176 --> 09:42.795
I was five
until I went off to college.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.156
Longesseven years of my life.

09:47.092 --> 09:48.728
Please, I'm asking you
as a friend.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.548
Are you making this a tier one
friendship request?

09:57.571 --> 09:58.622
(Sighs):
Fine.

09:59.158 --> 10:01.232
I really appreciate this.
Yeah, yeah.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.510
All right, Poindexter,
sit wn, shut up and listen.

10:06.257 --> 10:06.993
I'm sorry?

10:07.093 --> 10:08.597
That's how my father
always began

10:08.665 --> 10:10.036
Our football conversations.

10:11.081 --> 10:11.887
And if you'd like,

10:11.965 --> 10:12.959
After the game,

10:40.623 --> 10:42.764
When are you going to stop
making Con toast?

10:44.402 --> 10:46.615
When I have enough to destroy
all the human toast

10:46.668 --> 10:48.617
On the battlestar
known asGalactica.

10:51.712 --> 10:53.327
Is that what you're wearing
to watch football at Penny's?

10:54.235 --> 10:55.714
What's wrong
with a football jersey?

10:55.823 --> 10:59.100
Nothing. That, however, appears
to be a football cocktail dress.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.611
I's the smallest size they had,

11:05.199 --> 11:06.347
Except the one for dogs.

11:08.258 --> 11:09.803
I can't believe
they had one for dogs.

11:10.747 --> 11:11.451
Oh, yes.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.956
Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.986
Cats, however, refuse
to wear sporting apparel.

11:18.704 --> 11:20.528
My sister found that out
the hard way.

11:22.089 --> 11:23.195
Anyway, wish me luck.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.350
Leonard, wait.

11:24.442 --> 11:28.265
Am I correct in assuminghat
your attempt to be accepted

11:31.699 --> 11:34.101
To ensure your continuing
mating privileges with her?

11:36.516 --> 11:38.399
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way

11:39.130 --> 11:40.405
How would you put it?

11:41.724 --> 11:42.911
Yeah, okay, like you said.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.056
Huh. Seems like an awful
lot of trouble

11:47.127 --> 11:48.512
To go through for intercourse.

11:50.383 --> 11:52.879
Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

11:58.272 --> 12:00.381
Another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

12:03.463 --> 12:04.588
Good-Bye, Sheldon.

12:06.097 --> 12:07.123
Hold on

12:07.182 --> 12:08.433
I believe that
social convention

12:08.504 --> 12:10.278
Dictate you not arrive
empty-Handed.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.207
Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.320
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.

12:19.345 --> 12:20.222
(Door closes)

12:21.122 --> 12:22.735
What's funny about Cylon toast?

12:28.288 --> 12:29.125
It's open.

12:30.729 --> 12:32.027
Hey, pal.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.859
What do you want?
(TV clicks off)

12:35.928 --> 12:37.707
I brought you
a little gift.

12:38.430 --> 12:39.855
New kite.

12:42.383 --> 12:44.834
The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang,

12:45.414 --> 12:46.414
Indian fighting kite

12:46.486 --> 12:47.866
That my brother sent to me
from New Delhi.

12:47.926 --> 12:50.155
It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.577
This is Hello Kitty.

12:55.972 --> 12:58.448
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.955
Does a Patang?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.267
Wow, you just don't
get it, do you?

13:04.423 --> 13:06.176
Buying me something
pretty isn't going

13:06.252 --> 13:07.790
To make our problem
just go away.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.924
Look, I admit
I haven't always been

13:12.009 --> 13:13.474
The best friend I could be.

13:13.582 --> 13:15.947
<i>Y've been a sucky friend,
a sucky, sucky friend.</i>

13:17.085 --> 13:18.523
Stipulated.

13:18.635 --> 13:19.842
And you do it
all the time.

13:19.923 --> 13:21.669
Last week in the mall at
Radio Shack, we were looking

13:21.751 --> 13:23.652
For a phone with giant
numbers for your mother,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.554
And I suddenly realize
you're not even there.

13:26.653 --> 13:33.028
I know, I know...
Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick. Were you?

13:33.087 --> 13:34.732
But in my defense,
she was gorgeous!

13:34.819 --> 13:36.929
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade,

13:37.028 --> 13:39.489
Going  and down
and up and down.

13:40.885 --> 13:42.252
It was like
a free pole dance

13:42.302 --> 13:43.916
Right in the middle
of the food court.

13:45.632 --> 13:46.670
You're impossible.

13:47.210 --> 13:49.240
Hey, at least I can
talk to women

13:49.300 --> 13:50.556
Without being drunk.

13:50.886 --> 13:52.934
Excuse me,
I have selective mutism,

13:52.996 --> 13:54.619
A recognized medical disorder.

13:55.165 --> 13:56.413
You're just a douche.

13:58.707 --> 13:59.691
No. You know what?

13:59.763 --> 14:01.958
Maybe that's what
this whole thing's about.

14:02.019 --> 14:02.995
You're not mad at me,

14:03.057 --> 14:04.410
You're mad at yourself.

14:04.479 --> 14:05.558
No, I'm mad at you.

14:05.657 --> 14:07.456
I hate myself,
but I'm mad at you.

14:08.856 --> 14:10.218
Fine. You're mad at me.
I get it.

14:10.799 --> 14:13.389
How about we go
spend the day together?

14:15.193 --> 14:16.401
Just the two of us.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.785
We'll go anywhere you want.

14:19.478 --> 14:20.633
I don't know.

14:21.297 --> 14:22.249
Come on.

14:23.536 --> 14:24.887
Let me take you someplace nice.

14:30.331 --> 14:32.643
I-I do enjoy
the La Brea Tar Pits.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.512
Really, now? With the traffic
and the parking?

14:38.048 --> 14:39.049
Okay, fine.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.022
The Tar Pits.
Let's go.

14:46.859 --> 14:48.611
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

14:48.697 --> 14:49.988
(Exclaims)

14:53.277 --> 14:56.048
Go! Go! Go!

14:56.127 --> 14:57.398
Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes!

14:57.491 --> 14:59.035
Are you people watching this?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.328
Is this amazing or what?

15:01.220 --> 15:02.344
Sweetie, that's a highlight

15:02.426 --> 15:04.024
From the '98
championship game.

15:05.149 --> 15:07.234
Oh. Did not know that.

15:08.546 --> 15:10.472
How much beer have you had?
None, why?

15:10.546 --> 15:13.073
Oh. I was just kind of
hoping you were drunk.

15:14.794 --> 15:16.286
Now we're back live.
Okay, yeah.

15:16.385 --> 15:17.728
I can see the difference.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.804
Oh, where's the flag?
That's intentional grounding.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.804
Totally.
That completely was

15:23.859 --> 15:26.556
A forward pass, which they
threw intentionally incomplete

15:26.628 --> 15:29.070
To avoid loss of yardage
or to conserve time

15:31.137 --> 15:32.085
I can't believe they're not

15:32.151 --> 15:33.971
Being penalized
with the loss of a down

15:34.025 --> 15:35.923
And by having to move the line
of scrimmage

15:35.992 --> 15:37.526
Back to the spot of the foul.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.147
Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.254
Penny, you know
I'm lactose intolerant.

15:45.575 --> 15:47.034
I know. I just need you
stop talking.

15:49.094 --> 15:50.024
(Knocking)
SHELDON:
Penny.

15:50.084 --> 15:52.032
Penny. Penny.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.748
Sheldon, come in.
Thank you.

15:55.834 --> 15:58.263
I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

16:00.699 --> 16:02.008
There's some
in the fridge.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.505
You shouldn't keep your bread
in the refrigerator.

16:04.593 --> 16:06.208
Staleness is caused
by crystallization

16:06.266 --> 16:08.162
Of the starch molecules,
which occurs faster

16:08.260 --> 16:10.448
At cool temperatures.
On Earth,

16:10.517 --> 16:11.643
We say "thank you."

16:13.234 --> 16:15.873
So Leonard,
how goes the mimesis?

16:16.472 --> 16:17.505
"Mimesis"?

16:17.579 --> 16:20.175
You know. Mimesis.

16:21.417 --> 16:24.368
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties

16:24.454 --> 16:27.083
Of a specific object
or organism.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.525
Mimesis.

16:31.138 --> 16:32.358
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:34.128 --> 16:35.819
I'm attempting
to communicate with you

16:35.891 --> 16:38.937
Without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

16:39.593 --> 16:41.059
Let me try again.

16:42.484 --> 16:45.007
Have the indigenous fauna

16:45.078 --> 16:47.018
Accepted you as oneof their own?

16:48.893 --> 16:50.524
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

16:52.451 --> 16:53.451
Oh, I guess so.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.618
Good. Oh, FYI.

16:55.679 --> 16:58.277
After I eat my sandwich,
I'm taking Koothrappali's

16:58.334 --> 17:00.155
Patang kite
out for a test run.

17:00.247 --> 17:02.856
Would you like to get your
delta-Wing raptor and join me?

17:02.953 --> 17:04.769
I don't want to fly kites,
Sheldon.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.136
We're watching football here.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.001
I can see that.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.905
I was providing you
with an alternative.

17:10.925 --> 17:14.560
A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

17:16.737 --> 17:17.628
(Whistle blows on TV)

17:17.704 --> 17:18.702
Oh, look at that.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.531
Indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

17:23.722 --> 17:25.099
I hope he's right, 'cause if
he'not, it'll cost him

17:25.183 --> 17:26.448
One of his three time-Outs.

17:33.019 --> 17:33.992
You know, Leonard, honey,

17:34.587 --> 17:38.356
I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.219
No, I'll watch the
end of the game.

17:40.272 --> 17:41.505
Besides, there's only
three minutes left.

17:41.569 --> 17:43.186
Until halftime.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.694
This is just half?

17:46.113 --> 17:47.369
We've been here for hours.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.189
And you're gonna be here
for a couple more.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.589
Oh, you're kidding me.
No.

17:50.660 --> 17:51.935
Nice meeting all of you.

17:55.272 --> 17:57.590
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

18:10.392 --> 18:11.982
I really like my
saber-Toothed cat.

18:12.038 --> 18:12.944
Thank you.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.510
My pleasure.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.290
Maybe after lunch,
we can go to Marie Callender's

18:17.367 --> 18:18.738
And have some pie.

18:19.642 --> 18:20.211
I'd like that.

18:21.776 --> 18:23.338
(Takes deep breath)

18:23.421 --> 18:25.180
This is turning out
to be a perfect Saturday.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.053
Good. I'm glad.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.305
Oh, man. Did you see
the way she smiled at me?

18:34.517 --> 18:35.612
Fine. Go ahead.

18:36.185 --> 18:38.071
No. This is our day.

18:38.119 --> 18:39.495
If you want
to chase after her,

18:39.563 --> 18:40.652
Chase after her.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.374
Ah, who am I kidding?
I wouldn't have a shot
with a girl like that.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.662
Don't put yourself down.

18:46.714 --> 18:48.013
You're a very attractive man.

18:48.489 --> 18:49.946
You think so?
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.451
Absolutely.
It wouldn't kill you

18:51.513 --> 18:53.185
To take a Pilates clas
with me now and then,

18:53.268 --> 18:54.589
But you have acertain

18:56.557 --> 18:58.002
Yeah, well,
it doesn't matter

18:58.060 --> 18:59.893
'Cause she wasn't
really smiling at me.

19:00.451 --> 19:01.955
Actually, in this case,
I think she was.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.398
Really?

19:03.454 --> 19:04.895
Yeah.
Bye.

19:07.349 --> 19:08.672
What a douche.
