00:08.634 --> 00:10.301
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.386 --> 00:11.594
My kid's sick. l think l might have caught it.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.054
Do me a favor? Can you go to Duane Reade

00:13.138 --> 00:17.225
and pick me up some antihistamines
and cough syrup, Robo DXM?

00:17.476 --> 00:19.977
Do me a favor? Go to Duane Reade,
pick me up some NoDoz?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.270
The newsstand is out of it.

00:28.112 --> 00:32.156
lf a co-worker so much as
raises the specter of substance abuse,

00:32.241 --> 00:34.492
l am required by law to inform HR.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.412
l sent you up to oncology
with 40 fentanyl patches.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.705
Only 30 got there.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.582
You broke the chain of custody
during an inter-pharmacy run.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.835
On my first or second day? Come on, man.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.341
My heart's going really fast.
Can you check my pulse?

00:50.426 --> 00:51.426
Sure, sweetie. Come here.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.386
She's gonna be my wife, Eddie.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.763
Logged on,
started looking up old girlfriends. Boom.

00:55.848 --> 00:56.848
She's the one.

00:57.141 --> 01:02.603
l've gone 37 hours with no Percocet,
no Vicodin, no oxy.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.648
How the fuck am l gonna make it to 38?

02:10.756 --> 02:13.257
Gotta say, l'm really blown away
that you would meet us this early.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.425
We appreciate it.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.010
No, schedules are schedules.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.806
And this is a decision
that affects the whole family, so...

02:20.557 --> 02:23.017
Grace, do you want to start?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.061
lt's okay, monkey.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.983
l think if l think bad things,
they're gonna happen.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.821
Honey.
l think everybody thinks that sometimes.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.782
l don't want to tell them.

02:37.866 --> 02:42.119
We have been exploring
the possibility of medication.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.329
Really, Grace?

02:43.413 --> 02:46.999
Do you want to help your mom and dad
understand why you want to do this?

02:47.084 --> 02:49.335
No one's saying no, honey.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.921
Just tell us what's going on.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.051
l can't get my thoughts to slow down.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.887
l try to stop them. l pray.

03:00.889 --> 03:05.434
l have a rosary. And even when l'm sleeping,
l have a dream journal.

03:06.270 --> 03:12.900
But it's got a lot of nightmares in it
about animals and fire.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.405
But, honey, medicine doesn't always do
what you think it's gonna do.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.407
l'm not a psychiatrist but l...

03:19.491 --> 03:22.201
No, l'm reluctant to prescribe an SSRl,

03:22.286 --> 03:25.663
because while they're very effective
in treating acute anxiety,

03:25.747 --> 03:30.084
they're primarily used in cases
of depression. And l just... l don't...

03:30.460 --> 03:33.296
l don't see
the depressive component in Grace.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.756
Tell me if you agree.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.592
l'm not sad.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.969
Okay, that's good.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.474
But l'm afraid
l'm gonna start pulling my hair out again.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.061
And l don't want to. l like my hair.
l think it's pretty.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.525
l've seen success
with pediatric doses of Xanax.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.445
lt would allow Grace
to spot-treat her anxiety,

03:57.738 --> 03:59.238
giving her a sense of control.

03:59.323 --> 04:04.744
And unlike an SSRl, she doesn't have to
take it every day which l think is important.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.331
ls this really what you want to do, Grace?

04:11.543 --> 04:14.795
l just don't want you guys
to be disappointed in me.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.803
l have a couple quick questions
l want to ask your mom and dad.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.728
You good?

04:41.281 --> 04:45.159
So has anything changed
recently in the household?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.912
Any additional stress?

04:48.830 --> 04:49.830
No.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.249
Not that l can think of.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.877
No, it's business as usual.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.008
Hey.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.388
-You okay?
-Just came from Grace's shrink.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.473
Fucking ripped my guts out.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.810
What do you need from me? What can l do?

05:12.688 --> 05:14.897
lt's for my kid. Can you believe it?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.942
That's rough. That's rough.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.111
Yeah.

05:20.195 --> 05:23.447
She asked me and Kevin in front of
her doctor if she could go on medication.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.700
What am l doing?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.451
Maybe it's just for a little while.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.037
You know,
just to get her through a rough patch.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.248
Eddie, look who you're talking to.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.086
Well, that's a low dose.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.379
That's good, right?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.801
Actually, l'm swamped here.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.844
lt's all right. lt can wait.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.097
l'm not even sure l have this low a dose.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.642
You might be better off
going to a drugstore.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.895
Just fill it when you can, okay?
l'll come back later.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.273
Thanks, Eddie.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.027
Welcome to emergency.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.946
We will be taking you department
by department in groups of three.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.324
That's groups of three.
Keep the hubbub down, folks.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.493
Hope you don't have lunch plans.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.412
You two are next.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.415
Sorry l'm late. Did l miss anything?
What the hell is she doing?

06:14.499 --> 06:17.668
Hey, ringers off! Get with the program!

06:18.253 --> 06:20.254
Flu shots. lt's doctor day.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.340
Every day is doctor day.
She must be in heaven.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.552
Wait till you get a load of Thor.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.764
Yes, Dr. Saqr from ortho.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.891
That means falcon, does it not?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.768
No clue. Can you just...

06:34.019 --> 06:36.187
Sure. No need for small talk.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.858
Got my braces off today.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.618
Three years with adult braces,
you could at least look.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.787
Next.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.497
Yeah, but compared to Bellevue?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.248
Just saying it's a different animal, man.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.834
lt's not that there's more action,
just better action.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.004
More gunshots, more stabbings.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.715
Can't all be bullets and life support.

07:04.966 --> 07:05.966
Want to tell me what happened?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.676
No, l don't want to say now.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.931
l was holding my neighbor's kid,
a three-month old.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.140
There's nothing like it.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.894
Yeah, well, except she reached out
and scratched my cornea.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.312
The kid l mean. Not the mom.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.231
No good deed, right?

07:20.315 --> 07:23.818
Woke up with the girlfriend.
Not gonna lie, magical.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.152
Strong words there, Hoss.

07:25.237 --> 07:28.656
Hooked on a feeling, yo.
She is gonna die when l propose.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.157
l know l would.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.743
How about some Percocet for your patient?
l'll be back in a second.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.120
We'll be right here.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.288
-One second.
-Kelly, take over for Jackie.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.290
-Follow me.
-You got it.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.295
ls this like a random urine test?

07:45.507 --> 07:46.549
Please tell me this is random.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.300
Nobody's furnishing any urine.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.594
No, l understand that.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.638
l just want to know if l am being singled out.

07:52.931 --> 07:53.931
Don't push me, Jackie.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.142
You pull me in here
and tell me l can't administer meds

07:56.226 --> 07:59.019
and you expect me not to push you?
What are you talking about?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.230
HR called me. That's all l'm gonna say.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.773
Okay, and said what?

08:02.858 --> 08:05.276
HR has a bee in its bonnet.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.986
They're under the impression that someone

08:07.320 --> 08:10.489
in the emergency department
is abusing narcotics.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.533
Okay, so this is an HR decision?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.160
No, it's my decision.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.080
-Why?
-l don't want HR

08:18.165 --> 08:21.625
launching a full-fledged investigation
because then l'll have no say in the matter.

08:21.710 --> 08:26.255
l'm handling this the best way l can think of
and hoping it goes away.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.716
l'm protecting my department.
l'm protecting you.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.968
l don't need your protection.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.471
You're running a sinking ship here, Gloria.
You want to take me off the deck?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.307
That is the stupidest thing l ever heard of.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.434
Jackie, at a certain point the discrepancies

08:38.518 --> 08:40.686
reflect on my ability
to control my department.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.396
Okay, what about Sam?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.023
All he talks about is being an addict.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.025
And Kelly. You don't know
a goddamn thing about that guy.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.777
This goes back a long time
even before they got here.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.446
And l made a point of telling you

08:50.530 --> 08:53.490
that if a co-worker
even raises a specter of narcotics abuse...

08:53.575 --> 08:55.576
All right. Yes, l know what you told me.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.287
God damn it.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.290
This is my reputation we're talking about.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.835
-Does anybody else know about this?
-No.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.629
l alerted the pharmacy, but no.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.672
None of the nurses know.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.091
Neither do any of the physicians.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.094
-l need a favor.
-No.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.680
No, l'm not asking you to go back
on your decision, okay?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.098
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.268
Just please don't tell anybody.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.687
l need to

09:24.606 --> 09:28.776
maintain at least the facade of dignity
in front of my co-workers, okay? Please.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.527
This is important to me.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.112
Fine.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.490
lt stays between us.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.951
But bear in mind somebody told somebody.
People know.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.162
l don't know what to say about that.

09:40.247 --> 09:44.041
l cannot even imagine
how somebody in this hospital thinks...

09:44.125 --> 09:45.709
Wait. Yes, l can.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.547
Jackie, leave it alone. Jackie.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.811
-Hey, Jackie.
-Don't say a fucking word.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.689
What was that about?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.148
lt's Monday.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.738
All l said was,
"Got a minute for the Madagascar lemur?"

10:14.823 --> 10:16.865
And a pack of frat boys went off on me.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.910
All right, could you relax
and follow my finger, Mr. Finch?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.247
Like l want to be out there
asking people to sign my clipboard,

10:23.331 --> 10:26.375
giving me dorm rooms
and fake phone numbers. lt's bullshit.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.210
lt's total bullshit.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.758
l give you a shred of information about
my life and you go running your mouth?

10:34.843 --> 10:36.135
What, did you think you were helping me?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.387
-Stop it.
-'Cause nobody can be that stupid.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.223
Especially not you.
What the fuck were you thinking?

10:42.017 --> 10:44.518
Leave. Get out now.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.021
Yeah, order me out of my own trauma.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.404
Right, l'd like to get you up to CT, Mr. Finch.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.450
l suspect you have a fractured cheekbone.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.660
-Want to talk?
-Stay out of it, Zoey.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.122
-l know, but...
-You're in way over your head.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.290
No, l don't think l am.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.834
No more fighting, man. Peace is the word.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.210
That's from Grease.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.047
You guys have a bond.

11:13.131 --> 11:17.134
Doctors and nurses, no longer cats
and dogs. l've blogged about it.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.385
Replace yourself.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.638
lmmediately!

11:28.188 --> 11:29.813
-Will you go in...
-Are you okay?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.440
-Will you go in and assist?
-Yeah, yeah, but...

11:31.524 --> 11:33.192
No. No, it's okay. Just go.

11:33.276 --> 11:37.196
Just so you know, Jackie came out of there
more calm on the outside,

11:37.280 --> 11:41.075
pissed on the inside than l've ever seen her
and now you in tears.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.078
Used to like O'Hara. After this, not so much.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.747
You guys, they're fighting.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.458
-My money's on O'Hara.
-Your money's no good here.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.295
Dude, having Jackie mad at you is
about the harshest feeling in the world.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.172
So l feel bad for her.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.008
-Who you feeling bad for?
-O'Hara.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.511
Why do you feel bad for O'Hara?
She's a doctor

12:00.595 --> 12:05.224
with awesome shoes and a town car
and an accent. Case closed.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.184
Jackie's mad at her.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.771
-l feel bad for her.
-l'm still taking Jackie's side.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.940
You guys, we don't even know
why they're fighting.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.234
Doesn't matter. Team O'Hara.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.610
And it's not because she's a doctor.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.405
Good-looking people have to stick together.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.920
Okay, promise not to laugh.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.228
-What's up?
-Hey, guy.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.608
This is my friend Dylan.
He got his head stuck in his chair.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.901
lt's not my chair.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.486
And there goes Cooper Duper.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.322
ls that Cooper from the fantasy league?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.370
Pull it together, pal.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.208
l don't know what you said
or who you said it to.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.463
All l know is that after 20 years of nursing,
l can't dispense meds.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.339
Sit down and shut up.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.427
lf l had any interest
in having you pulled off the floor,

13:23.511 --> 13:25.345
-l'd have done it ages ago.
-ls that right?

13:25.597 --> 13:28.390
l'd have had to fit it in between
spontaneous nosebleeds and interventions,

13:28.475 --> 13:29.725
but yes, that's right.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.810
You knicked an MRl from a cripple.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.270
And before l could catch my breath,

13:33.354 --> 13:34.980
your husband had dragged me
into a whirlwind of panic

13:35.064 --> 13:36.106
'cause you got sloppy.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.274
All right.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.276
l don't talk about it

13:40.278 --> 13:42.863
because l don't like talking about it.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.867
And l know full well
that if l did start talking about it,

13:46.951 --> 13:50.329
you'd go so far underground
that no one would hear your cry for help

13:50.413 --> 13:52.664
if in fact one day you need it.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.711
What l expect from you, what l demand
right now is the benefit of the doubt.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.089
l've said nothing.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.718
And l've been asked.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.638
Have you?

14:08.932 --> 14:09.973
Yes.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.770
lt's just so humiliating.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.982
All of a sudden l can't dispense meds.
Everybody knows what that means.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.653
Stick close to me.
l'll administer anything l prescribe.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.154
Somebody went to HR.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.948
So let's get through this,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.659
find out who it is
and burn their playhouse down, yes?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.122
Are you guys still fighting?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.415
-Yes.
-Very much so.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.795
We need your help with a patient.
Dr. Cooper is useless.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.922
Yes, all right.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.261
lf Coop finds out, just shoot me now.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.555
Dump the pharmacy runs on Zoey.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.307
Yes, the pharmacy has been alerted.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.852
Oh, my God.
That's why he couldn't fill my scrip.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.396
-What?
-Eddie.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.940
This morning for Grace, not for me.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.066
Xanax.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.652
Oh, my God.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.987
She's 1 1 .

15:09.367 --> 15:10.867
More Vaseline?

15:11.828 --> 15:15.622
ln a perfect world we'd have this off
before your father gets here.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.295
Kelly, kidney stone in six needs morphine.
You want to get that?

15:21.379 --> 15:22.796
No, not really.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.217
Go ahead.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.642
Dylan.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.313
Hi, Dad. Look what l did.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.651
Jeez. What goes on in the mind
of an 1 1 -year-old.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.820
l wish l knew.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.038
No.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.998
Hey, Gloria.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.334
Zen temple?

16:01.669 --> 16:04.087
Rainforest. Go away.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.799
So did you hear the big news?

16:07.884 --> 16:10.093
Thor got his braces off. l know everything.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.346
No, l'm getting married.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.390
Why aren't people talking about this?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.060
-So l was thinking...
-Never good.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.145
l want to reserve the chapel.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.023
l'm not a party planner.
l don't take reservations, Dr. Cooper.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.776
But it's my wedding. Maybe on my birthday.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.695
No, definitely on my birthday.
Which means the date's not flexible.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.199
Come on, Gloria. This place is my life.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.995
And the chapel, its stained glass windows,
the little candles, the mannequins.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.456
They're not mannequins.
They're statues and they're gone.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.166
What do you mean they're gone?

16:41.376 --> 16:42.876
They've been gone for weeks.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.004
Well, we've gotta get them back.
lt's my birthday wedding.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.383
We can't.
They're being held in Staten lsland.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.135
Held? Like, for ransom?

16:55.431 --> 16:59.893
Matter of fact, yes. For ransom. Exactly.
Fuckers.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.812
'Cause l'll pay.
l've got football money coming.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.355
Let me make some calls.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.232
You sure about this?

17:07.902 --> 17:12.114
Birthday wedding. Coop style.
The sky's the limit.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.074
People are gonna freak.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.039
Madagascar lemur.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.999
Little yellow eyes, stripey tail.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.751
Like raccoons.

17:24.836 --> 17:28.505
Raccoons are cool
but they can fend for themselves.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.966
They're tough. Not lemurs, man.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.843
They need a little backup these days.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.345
That's a good fight. Keep on it.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.722
Thanks, man.

17:37.348 --> 17:41.143
l have to confess, l don't know a lot
about the Madagascar lemur.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.353
They have small brains.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.189
That's probably why they're endangered.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.566
Little tiny brains.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.319
Yeah, it's either that or
the industrialized world's insatiable lust

17:51.404 --> 17:53.363
for deforestation and paper products.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.240
l hate the industrialized world.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.536
Also, l have a Kindle.

18:01.956 --> 18:06.001
Have you actually ever seen a lemur,
you know, in person?

18:06.836 --> 18:07.878
No.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.843
And yet you risk your life.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.972
Oh, my God, Hoss from radiology.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.683
lt's me Thor, from Cooper Duper.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.144
Hey, Thor, wanna pick out engagement rings
with me after work?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.813
Only if Jackie doesn't need moral support.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.315
O'Hara's the worst.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.984
There goes Team Jackie,
running off at the mouth.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.402
Stop talking about me.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.280
Really, Hoss, these are the clowns
you're losing our money to?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.493
Evil genius clowns.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.703
-Bring it!
-Roll up your sleeve.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.997
This may sting a little. l mean, a lot.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.874
Where's my boo?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.959
Creeping on world peace. Right behind you.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.170
-Zoey, are you flirting?
-No.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.301
She's not flirting, man.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.930
Not even a little bit.
Lenny, l'd like you to meet Kyle.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.392
-What's up with your grill?
-Kyle is a lemur advocate.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.145
Actually,
l collect signatures to halt deforestation.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.565
l'm not so much pro lemur
as l am anti big business.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.652
Yeah, fuck the lemurs.
l'm sure they can handle the bulldozers.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.737
-Lenny.
-Say that again and l'll knock your teeth out.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.406
Stand up for what you love, man.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.204
See you after work?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.668
Boyfriend.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.798
l'm not asking you to give the statues back.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.051
Almost done. Sit.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.641
Listen, Father, you're a fundraiser.
l'm a fundraiser.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.645
l'd like to think that Catholic Charities
is open to a generous donation

19:48.729 --> 19:51.815
in exchange for the safe return
of the statues.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.948
l'll see what l can do.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.664
$7,000. He's out of his fucking mind!

20:09.584 --> 20:11.877
Probably wants them in small bills, too.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.003
How can l help you?

20:13.087 --> 20:15.797
This business with Jackie.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.674
Off-limits.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.468
l thought as much.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.347
Nothing you did set it off,
if that's what you're worried about.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.559
Not worried.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.937
Are you trying to buy your statues back?

20:32.106 --> 20:34.649
l want them back for the chapel.
Coop wants them back for his wedding.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.734
lt's a win-win.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.487
Well, if you come up short,
l'm happy to help.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.740
l'd rather gouge Coop.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.293
You're not really working, are you? You're
on Facebook or Skype or something, right?

20:53.628 --> 20:55.962
Reading about warts. Gross.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.300
May l?

21:09.226 --> 21:10.518
Fabulous about the wedding.

21:11.228 --> 21:21.947
Fingers crossed.

21:24.700 --> 21:29.579
Do you know, l'm curious, though. You and l
working together what, five, six years?

21:32.458 --> 21:37.462
Here you are on the verge of signing away
your willy until death do you part,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.840
and you've never asked me out.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.259
Not once.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.721
Never gave it the old college try.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.141
Didn't want to give it a go?

21:50.726 --> 21:53.228
Me? No. No. l'll give it a go.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.730
We can go now. lt's not official.
l haven't even proposed yet.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.816
l just always assumed you'd say no.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.651
But you never asked.
How would you know if you never asked?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.987
l'm asking. Come on, let's go.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.114
lt's no good if l have to drag it out of you.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.908
You're not dragging. Who's dragging?
No one's dragging. See? Watch.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.159
Wanna go on a date?

22:08.244 --> 22:11.663
No, thank you. No. Absolutely not.
God, no. Never.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.043
Why would you make me ask you out
if you were just gonna say no?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.046
Ego is ego, my friend.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.340
ls that Latin?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.306
Happy for you.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.185
Cheers.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.149
l get it, Kev. l just thought,

22:39.233 --> 22:42.027
you know, after this morning, that it
would be nice to have dinner as a family.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.988
l know, babe.
But we can do a nice big breakfast.

22:45.072 --> 22:49.367
Well, l'm cutting out early today.
So, you know, l'll see you or l won't.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.078
Kevin, l need to believe
that we're in this together.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.580
We are.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.000
lt's only dinner, okay?
l'll get Sully to cover from 9:00 till 2:00.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.668
l'll be home by 9:30, 1 0:00 at the latest.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.671
All right. Do what you gotta do
and get home, okay? l love you.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.757
-l love you.
-Bye.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.555
-Fresh air?
-Yes, please.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.058
So how about this?

23:13.476 --> 23:17.187
l'm finally getting over
the nausea and the sweating.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.690
l'm a week off the pills, right?

23:20.775 --> 23:23.401
-You're kidding?
-No, l'm not kidding.

23:27.198 --> 23:31.618
Yes, a week to the day off of pills,
and my kid goes on them.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.120
And Akalitus bans me from the meds.

23:34.205 --> 23:37.040
And my fucking husband, who begs me
to take time off, is not even gonna be there

23:37.124 --> 23:39.542
when l get home today,
so what the fuck am l doing this for?

23:39.627 --> 23:42.295
Because you're fantastic!

23:43.589 --> 23:45.799
lt's ironic, though, isn't it?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.552
You want irony?

23:50.805 --> 23:53.473
Ordinarily l'd never tell a soul,

23:53.557 --> 23:57.060
but you've just told me
your deepest darkest, so here goes.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.145
l barged into Coop's office,

23:59.230 --> 24:01.648
told him l was wrecked
he was getting married,

24:01.732 --> 24:03.817
-crushed he'd never asked me out.
-You were kidding, right?

24:03.901 --> 24:06.402
l was not. And then l kissed him.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.488
-No.
-Yes.

24:09.031 --> 24:12.492
l kissed him
and wished him the best and then,

24:14.453 --> 24:16.079
the feeling passed.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.374
The feeling passed.
Thank God the feeling passed

24:19.458 --> 24:22.335
because l don't know
if l could continue with our friendship.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.047
Just to be clear,
Coop is where you draw the line?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.800
Yeah. Yeah, l think it is.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.429
Hey, Jackie.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.267
l'm sorry. lt's my job.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.893
Yeah, l get it.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.940
lt's a small number of pills
in an incredibly low dose.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.276
With her tolerance,
she couldn't get high even if she wanted to.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.613
-Sorry, but it's true.
-Walking away.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.635
Thank you.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.619
You coming or going?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.080
Just getting away.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.378
Would you cover for me?

25:50.049 --> 25:53.426
l'd like to slip out early,
have dinner with my kids.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.889
Sure. lf it makes life easier, yeah.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.234
How long till l feel it?

26:11.153 --> 26:12.654
l don't know, baby.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.198
lt's different for different people.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.952
You've never taken anything before,
so it shouldn't be long.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.168
How are you feeling right now?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.297
lt's like...

26:33.509 --> 26:36.636
l'm on the edge of having 1 0 ideas

26:37.972 --> 26:40.056
all at once, only,

26:41.141 --> 26:44.644
maybe l don't have to have them.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.857
Like l could say "freeze."

26:50.359 --> 26:56.489
And walk right up to them
and see if l want to let them in or not.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.452
l don't think they're ever gonna go away,

27:02.204 --> 27:03.371
but...

27:06.375 --> 27:10.253
lf l don't want to think them, l don't have to.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.507
No, you don't.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.220
My heart is moving

27:22.474 --> 27:24.058
a little slower.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.855
l can't tell.

27:30.983 --> 27:34.235
But it's okay. lt's just for now.
