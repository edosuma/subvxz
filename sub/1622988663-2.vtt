America.

00:03.392 --> 00:04.813
God took extra care
when he made

00:04.913 --> 00:07.016
this country,
didn't he, Benny?

00:07.116 --> 00:09.138
You're talking about
the endless expanse of dirt

00:09.238 --> 00:11.240
in front of us?

00:12.801 --> 00:14.183
Ah, it's not just dirt.

00:14.283 --> 00:15.424
Look, there's a big rock.

00:15.524 --> 00:17.667
And a medium-sized rock.
That's fun.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.470
Okay, Rev, this might be
a good time to remind you

00:20.570 --> 00:22.151
that the only reason
I'm taking you

00:22.251 --> 00:23.312
and your friends
to Oregon

00:23.412 --> 00:24.634
is to avoid
swinging from a noose.

00:24.734 --> 00:27.237
And I'm definitely
not here to have fun. Got it?

00:27.337 --> 00:30.600
Got it. No fun
for the scary outlaw man.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.442
[eagle screeches]
Oh, my gosh, Benny,
a bald eagle!

00:32.542 --> 00:36.006
Wow! No wonder it became
the symbol of America.

00:36.106 --> 00:37.327
I mean,
look at its strength,

00:37.427 --> 00:40.130
its majesty.
Ah, certainly this

00:40.230 --> 00:41.652
is an auspicious sign
for our--

00:41.752 --> 00:43.754
- [gunshot]
- Oh!

00:47.598 --> 00:49.059
Why?

00:49.159 --> 00:51.582

- You just killed America.

on the trail.

01:25.757 --> 01:27.059
You thought today was tough,

01:27.159 --> 01:29.101
tomorrow we're gonna be
fording our first river,

01:29.201 --> 01:30.382
and it ain't
gonna be pretty.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.184
Aside from
the natural beauty,

01:32.284 --> 01:33.866
which will be stunning.

01:33.966 --> 01:36.068
Wait, bup-bup-bup!

01:36.168 --> 01:37.590
Let's not forget
about grace, though.

01:37.690 --> 01:40.313
- Yep.
- [all groan]

01:40.413 --> 01:42.034
Bless us, oh Lord,
and these thy gifts

01:42.134 --> 01:43.596
which we are about
to receive

01:43.696 --> 01:45.698
- through thy bounty.
- Am--

01:47.420 --> 01:48.882
You've given us
so many gifts,

01:48.982 --> 01:51.564
oh Lord,
too numerous to count.

01:51.664 --> 01:52.525
But I'll try.

01:52.625 --> 01:54.688
One, the rolling hills.

01:54.788 --> 01:57.130
Two, the beautiful sky.

01:57.230 --> 01:59.653
Three, trees.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.376
Just trees, in general,
are fantastic.

02:02.476 --> 02:04.698
Boo!
I'll take it from here.

02:04.798 --> 02:06.260
Cram it in, shit it out.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.582
That's what food
is all about. Amen.

02:08.682 --> 02:10.264
[laughter]

02:10.364 --> 02:11.986
That was really not
a proper grace.

02:12.086 --> 02:13.707
Hey, Rev.
Here's a grace for you.

02:13.807 --> 02:14.989
- [farts]
- Oh!

02:15.089 --> 02:16.711
[laughter]

02:16.811 --> 02:18.713
Unbelievable.

02:18.813 --> 02:19.674
Benny, can I have a word?

02:19.774 --> 02:20.835
- [crunches loudly]
- Oh, wow.

02:20.935 --> 02:22.637
Is that the bald eagle
you shot?
You bet.

02:22.737 --> 02:25.119
Nothing hits the spot after
a hard day on the trail

02:25.219 --> 02:27.161
like a roasted baldie.
You want some?

02:27.261 --> 02:28.763
- No, no thank you.
- Your loss.

02:28.863 --> 02:30.084
Face is the best part.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.247
[loud crunch]
Look, Benny, I know

02:32.347 --> 02:33.688
you come from
a bandit background,

02:33.788 --> 02:35.690
and therefore have
different values

02:35.790 --> 02:36.851
from the rest of us.
[coughs, spits]

02:41.636 --> 02:42.698
These people
look up to you,

02:42.798 --> 02:45.340
for reasons I do not
completely understand.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.742
I think if you
were to exhibit

02:46.842 --> 02:49.264
just the smallest fraction
of moral leadership,

02:49.364 --> 02:50.946
they would all follow suit.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.027
Yeah, I'm not gonna
do that.

02:52.127 --> 02:53.589
[scoffs] Why?

02:53.689 --> 02:56.752
Because there is no morality
on the trail.

02:56.852 --> 02:58.474
You think we're gonna
cross that river tomorrow

02:58.574 --> 02:59.835
by minding our Ps and Qs?

02:59.935 --> 03:01.757
The only morality out here

03:01.857 --> 03:03.759
is either kill or be killed.

03:03.859 --> 03:06.042
[drunkenly]
You said it, Benny.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.605
It's either kill
or be killed.

03:08.705 --> 03:10.567
Levi, are you drunk?

03:10.667 --> 03:13.089
Maybe I am,

Looks like the river's
deeper than we expected,

03:26.643 --> 03:28.465
so we're gonna float
the wagons across.

03:28.565 --> 03:29.747
So let's caulk 'em tight.

03:29.847 --> 03:31.949
Oh, that's
a fine-looking caulk

03:32.049 --> 03:33.070
you got there, William.

- Ooh, John.

You've got a big,
beautiful caulk, too.

making a pun involving
the word "caulk."

Oh, relax.
They're just having fun.

I mean, come on! We're about
to ford a frickin' river.

04:03.962 --> 04:05.183
How cool is that?

04:05.283 --> 04:06.625
Yeah, I would say less cool
and more terrifying,

04:06.725 --> 04:08.587
given the high percentage
chance that we die.

04:08.687 --> 04:09.708
You're looking at it
all wrong.

No. No, no, no, no, no.
Excuse me?

04:14.693 --> 04:16.715
Mr. Teen?
Does fording the river

04:16.815 --> 04:18.237
involve me getting wet?

04:18.337 --> 04:19.719
- Uh, probably.
- No.

04:19.819 --> 04:21.400
There's gotta be another way
to get across.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.683
Well, there's a ferry boat
a few miles down the road,

04:23.783 --> 04:25.725
but that's just for suckers
willing to pay a fortune.

04:25.825 --> 04:28.448
Perhaps you haven't
heard, then--I'm rich.

04:28.548 --> 04:31.291
I like that it's expensive.
I get off on that.

04:31.391 --> 04:33.373
Are you sure, dear? 'Cause
I was really looking forward

04:33.473 --> 04:34.694
to fording the river
with everyone.

Don't be silly.
You want to go on the ferry

04:37.197 --> 04:39.199
with the rich,
better people.

04:40.961 --> 04:42.963
Guess I'll see you
on the other side.
Right.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.226
They have
a nice relationship.

04:46.326 --> 04:47.788
Benny,
we got a problem.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.590
Can't get
the wagons to float.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.632
We moved some things around,
but we're still too heavy.

04:51.732 --> 04:53.233
Don't worry. I've got
a simple solution.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.275
I knew you would.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.756
Just gotta leave
somebody behind.

04:55.856 --> 04:56.997
Leave somebody behind?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.679
No, we can't do that.
That's a death sentence.

04:58.779 --> 05:01.242
Well, yeah, it'd be a bummer
for the one guy,

05:01.342 --> 05:03.604
but the rest of us get
to float across, no problem.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.206
Yeah, sure, of course
you would think of it

05:05.306 --> 05:06.247
like that,
but the rest of us

05:06.347 --> 05:07.208
will never
go along with that.

I'll take it from here, Rev.

for everybody here

not it!

- MAN: Not it!

"not it."

[scoffs]

05:19.040 --> 05:21.042
Too late.

05:23.325 --> 05:24.326
All right, the best way
to handle this

05:24.406 --> 05:26.108
is to leave
the weakest link behind.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.709
So all we gotta do
is figure out

05:27.809 --> 05:30.072
which one of you brings
the least to the table.

05:30.172 --> 05:31.673
Are you out of your mind?

05:31.773 --> 05:33.555
You can't put a value
on human life.

05:33.655 --> 05:36.158
Sure you can.
I'm a 10, you're a 6,

George is a 6.

Honestly, I'm seeing
a lot of 6s.

05:41.023 --> 05:42.725
I can't believe you all
are even considering this.

05:42.825 --> 05:45.047
We are talking about leaving
one of our own

05:45.147 --> 05:46.969
to die alone
in the wilderness.

05:47.069 --> 05:49.332
We still got to cut weight
to make it across the river.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.693
Well, we just have
to work together.

05:50.793 --> 05:52.415
Look, if each one of us
sacrifices

05:52.515 --> 05:54.017
something small and personal,

05:54.117 --> 05:55.058
we can cut the weight
that way.

05:55.158 --> 05:56.139
[laughs] Yeah.

05:56.239 --> 05:57.580
Like anybody's
gonna go for that.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.943
They will, because they are
not heartless monsters,

06:00.043 --> 06:02.065
like you.
Ah, perfect.

06:02.165 --> 06:03.547
John, perhaps you
would consider

06:03.647 --> 06:04.868
sacrificing
your rocking chair.

06:04.968 --> 06:06.229
It's a family heirloom!

06:06.329 --> 06:08.232
My grandaddy died
on that rocking chair.

06:08.332 --> 06:09.673
And three of my kids
were born on it.

06:09.773 --> 06:11.395
Wow, that chair's
seen a lot of action.

06:11.495 --> 06:12.476
All right, Granny McGill.

06:12.576 --> 06:13.677
What about
those pots and pans?

06:13.777 --> 06:14.798
Surely you can lose
a couple of them

06:14.898 --> 06:15.960
if it means saving a life.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.241
What am I supposed to do,

06:17.341 --> 06:19.523
make beans in a stew pot?

06:19.623 --> 06:22.206
Make stew in a bean pot?
What about the piano?

06:22.306 --> 06:23.527
Surely we can do without
Martha's piano.

06:23.627 --> 06:25.570
What? And no tunes
for the road?

about our friends.

06:45.931 --> 06:48.053
I feel bad for not
fording the river with them.

06:49.214 --> 06:51.276
Are you joking?
This is way better.

06:51.376 --> 06:52.878
Now we're going to Oregon
in style.

did you just say Oregon?

to Oregon, too.

Yeah.

in the
"Ethspanish" territory.

07:12.679 --> 07:13.940
Wow. I'm so jealous.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.622
It was super meaningful,

07:15.722 --> 07:19.065
You know,
living that #WagonLife.

07:19.165 --> 07:20.307
What's WagonLife?

07:20.407 --> 07:21.948
- Oh, it's a lifestyle.
- Lifestyle.

07:22.048 --> 07:24.030
Yeah, we travel around
the country

07:24.130 --> 07:25.312
in a refurbished wagon

07:25.412 --> 07:26.994
going wherever
the good wind takes us.

07:27.094 --> 07:29.196
Yeah, we kind
of believe that

07:29.296 --> 07:31.438
if you're not living
every single second

07:31.538 --> 07:32.920
as an adventure,
it's like,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.101
what are you doing
with your life?
What are you doing?

07:34.181 --> 07:35.883
Like, what are you doing?

07:35.983 --> 07:38.566
Maybe it sounds stupid,
but not everyone gets it.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.927
I totally get it.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.970
I--I feel like that
all the time.
You do?

07:43.070 --> 07:45.012
It's... [clears throat]
just I thought you were

07:45.112 --> 07:47.935
perfectly happy being
my meek and servile wife.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.618
It's just, you know, I--
I could understand

07:50.718 --> 07:52.620
how someone else
could feel that way.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.342
Gotcha.
So we're about to go

07:54.442 --> 07:56.945
smoke a lot of opium.
That's the deal.

07:57.045 --> 07:58.586
That's what we're doing,
drugs.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.348
And we just kinda
wanted to know

08:00.448 --> 08:02.791
if you wanted
to come vibe with us.

08:02.891 --> 08:05.834
See what happens.
Yes, we'd love to.

08:05.934 --> 08:06.995
Oh, beauty.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.818
Yay! #NewFriends.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.041
Why does she
keep saying "hashtag"?

08:13.141 --> 08:15.084
Oh, yeah, Purple
was kicked in the head

08:15.184 --> 08:16.205
by a beautiful horse,

08:16.305 --> 08:18.087
so now she just
says things at random.

08:18.187 --> 08:18.968
Ah, got it.

08:19.068 --> 08:21.931
Yas, queen.
That's bae.

08:22.031 --> 08:24.333
It's cute, right?
That is bae, darling.

08:24.433 --> 08:26.335
All right, folks,
it's time to play

08:26.435 --> 08:28.818
ALL, CHANTING:
Who! Will! Die!

08:28.918 --> 08:30.099
I just want to say
I am sickened

08:30.199 --> 08:32.061
and appalled by all of this.

08:32.161 --> 08:33.983
Have we forsaken
our humanity?

08:34.083 --> 08:36.145
[all booing]

08:36.245 --> 08:38.628
When do you have time
to make that?

08:38.728 --> 08:40.030
All right, let's meet
our contestants.

08:40.130 --> 08:43.193
First up, she's got
the face of an angel,

08:43.293 --> 08:44.754
and the mouth of a sailor,

08:44.854 --> 08:45.996
it's Granny McGill!

08:46.096 --> 08:48.158
Kiss my pruny ass.

08:48.258 --> 08:49.800
[laughter]
Next up,
he's the little stinker

08:49.900 --> 08:52.042
with a host of chronic
health problems,

08:52.142 --> 08:53.083
it's Young Levi!

08:53.183 --> 08:54.965
[coughing]

08:55.065 --> 08:57.768
Oh, no. There's blood.

08:57.868 --> 09:00.251
[applause]
Last but not least,
she's fun-loving

09:00.351 --> 09:01.772
with a bun in the oven,

09:01.872 --> 09:03.854
it's Pregnant Ruth!

09:03.954 --> 09:06.097
Please let me out of this!

09:06.197 --> 09:07.458
Think of my baby!

09:07.558 --> 09:08.779
[laughter]
This is a tough one, huh?

09:08.879 --> 09:10.421
I think we're gonna have
to have a bonus round.

09:10.521 --> 09:12.383
A fight to the death!

09:12.483 --> 09:14.185
[cheers and applause]
No, no, no, no, no!

09:14.285 --> 09:15.506
This is grotesque.

09:15.606 --> 09:18.109
All right, if we have
to leave somebody behind,

09:18.209 --> 09:19.310
let it be me.

09:19.410 --> 09:20.712
[all gasp]

09:20.812 --> 09:22.434
Uh, Rev, I don't think

09:22.534 --> 09:24.075
you understand
how the rules work.

09:24.175 --> 09:25.116
You're off the hook.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.358
It's one of these losers
has to die.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.040
No, no, I understand
the rules, Benny.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.681
Just because everybody else
has abandoned

09:29.781 --> 09:30.963
their basic moral principles

09:31.063 --> 09:32.845
doesn't mean
I have to as well.

09:32.945 --> 09:35.207
All right, it's settled.
I'm--I'm staying.

09:35.307 --> 09:36.328
Hmm.

09:36.428 --> 09:38.130
- Thank you.
- Oh, of course.

09:38.230 --> 09:39.531
Thanks, Reverend.

09:39.631 --> 09:41.634
No problem, Levi.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.317
What the hell
is going on here?

09:46.599 --> 09:48.180
KYA:
Hit it. Hit it.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.382
Hit it. Hit it.

09:49.482 --> 09:52.745
- [coughs]
- [all chuckle]

09:52.845 --> 09:54.948
- Smooth, right?
- Okay.

09:55.048 --> 09:56.349
- It's good stuff.
- I like that.

09:56.449 --> 09:59.072
You guys are officially
my role models.

09:59.172 --> 10:00.714
You live in this cute wagon

10:00.814 --> 10:02.676
and go on
these fun adventures.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.117
How are you able
to live like this?

10:04.217 --> 10:07.040
We get paid to take pictures
of our travels.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.082
I mean, our fans love
to see the world

10:09.182 --> 10:10.283
through our unique lens.

10:10.383 --> 10:11.805
Let's show them pictures.

10:11.905 --> 10:14.127
Ah, this is us
with Lewis and Clark.

10:14.227 --> 10:17.411
PRU: What? You went on the
Lewis and Clark expedition?

10:17.511 --> 10:18.732
Mm-hmm. We know them.

10:18.832 --> 10:20.654
Tell me everything!

10:20.754 --> 10:22.776
Is Sacagawea just, like,
so beautiful in real life?

10:22.876 --> 10:24.098
We didn't go on the trip.

10:24.198 --> 10:25.379
We just happened
to be staying

10:25.479 --> 10:26.741
at the same hunting lodge.

10:26.841 --> 10:28.663
- Oh.
- Get this. This is crazy.

10:28.763 --> 10:31.065
Clark actually
thinks he's hot shit,

10:31.165 --> 10:33.388
and in reality,

10:33.488 --> 10:34.749
he's not.
He's not.

10:34.849 --> 10:36.070
- TODD: That is crazy.
- He's just, like, a guy.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.393
[gasps] Oh, this is us
at the White House.

10:38.493 --> 10:40.755
- KYA: Oh, my gosh.
- Babe, you are so hot in that.

10:40.855 --> 10:42.077
- And spiritual.
- Uh-huh.

10:42.177 --> 10:44.639
That is a picture
of me being spiritual.

10:44.739 --> 10:47.202
Okay. So what was
the White House like?

10:47.302 --> 10:49.244
We didn't go inside.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.206
It's actually
my personal belief

10:51.306 --> 10:53.308
that politics is fake.

10:54.309 --> 10:55.210
Huh.

10:55.310 --> 10:57.312
True.

11:02.718 --> 11:04.100
Hey, what's going on
over here?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.941
What are you doing
with all this river trash?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.783
I am building myself a raft

11:07.883 --> 11:09.345
made of discarded wagon parts

11:09.445 --> 11:10.626
tied together
with horse flesh.

11:10.726 --> 11:13.029
It's not much, I know,
but I am hoping

11:13.129 --> 11:15.131
the good Lord will have
mercy on my soul.

11:17.814 --> 11:18.995
- Whoa!
- All right, wise guy.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.117
The jig is up.
Tell me what's going on here

11:21.217 --> 11:22.158
or I'm gonna pump you
full of lead!

11:22.258 --> 11:23.480
There's nothing going on,
I swear.

11:23.580 --> 11:26.803
Oh, come on! No one willingly
dies for no reason!

11:26.903 --> 11:28.205
What are you getting
out of it?

11:28.305 --> 11:31.328
Nothing! I just--
It's being selfless.

11:31.428 --> 11:32.409
Self what?

11:32.509 --> 11:35.252
Selfless.
Like, when you do something

11:35.352 --> 11:38.215
for someone else with
no personal gain for yourself?

11:38.315 --> 11:41.178
Just out of the goodness
of your heart?

11:41.278 --> 11:45.903
You know, I did save a guy
from a fire once. Yeah.

11:46.003 --> 11:47.184
But I mean,
that was just to rob him.

11:47.284 --> 11:48.666
I shot him right after.

11:48.766 --> 11:50.548
Oh, no.
That's not it, then.

11:50.648 --> 11:52.710
I don't know how else
to put it, Benny.

11:52.810 --> 11:53.831
I just--I'm doing it because

11:53.931 --> 11:55.913
I think it's
the moral thing to do.

11:56.013 --> 11:58.476
No.
Nah, I'm not buying it.

11:58.576 --> 11:59.838
You're up to something.

11:59.938 --> 12:01.159
I'm really not.
I swear.

12:01.259 --> 12:04.763
Hey, watch out for this one,
folks. He's good.

12:04.863 --> 12:07.526
Very good.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.327
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't understand.

12:09.427 --> 12:11.289
So, you guys are just

12:11.389 --> 12:14.613
taking photos and not actually
doing these things?

12:14.713 --> 12:17.176
What's your point?
What about living your life

12:17.276 --> 12:18.617
like it's an adventure?

12:18.717 --> 12:19.858
I thought that
was your whole thing.

12:19.958 --> 12:22.902
It is, but it's also
just like,

12:23.002 --> 12:24.263
you know,
an inspirational quote

12:24.363 --> 12:26.906
for, like, basic farm girls
to stitch on a pillow.

12:27.006 --> 12:29.008
It's our brand.

12:29.408 --> 12:31.270
Oh, my God.

12:31.370 --> 12:33.352
I shouldn't be here.
I should be fording the river.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.234
Ew. Why would you be
fording the river?

12:35.334 --> 12:37.677
Sweetheart,
never ford a river.
Oh, that's so gross.

12:37.777 --> 12:39.199
[scoffs] No, my friends
are out there

12:39.299 --> 12:41.681
having a real adventure,
unlike you guys

12:41.781 --> 12:44.644
who are just #fake.
Hey! Excuse me.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.286
Do not make fun of
my wife's condition.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.989
It took hours to get
that horseshoe out of her head.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.852
Wait, Prudence!
What are you doing?

12:51.952 --> 12:53.533
The ferry's
about to take off.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.335
Prudence!

12:55.435 --> 12:56.537
I--

12:56.637 --> 12:58.419
[groans] I'm so sorry.

12:58.519 --> 13:00.501
Yeah, it's a bummer.

13:00.601 --> 13:02.222
I really thought
we were all gonna swing.

13:02.322 --> 13:03.504
[sighs]

13:03.604 --> 13:05.626
Well, I am still down.
PURPLE: No.

13:05.726 --> 13:08.269
It was you watching,
at best.

13:08.369 --> 13:09.830
- I liked her.
- At best.

13:09.930 --> 13:12.193
Hnaah...
KYA: You should probably
head out.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.554
- I'm gonna go.
- KYA: Yeah, head out.

13:13.654 --> 13:15.196
- I'm gonna go.
- KYA: Goodbye.

13:15.296 --> 13:17.278
- Thank you for the drugs.
- Yes.

13:17.378 --> 13:20.281
All right, folks,
it's fording time!

13:20.381 --> 13:21.242
[all cheer]

13:21.342 --> 13:22.524
- Yeah!
- Ha ha! Come on, now.

13:22.624 --> 13:24.486
- Yeah!
- Move 'em out.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.588
Come on,
put some muscle into it!

13:32.234 --> 13:34.456
Well, God,

13:34.556 --> 13:36.558
wish me luck.

13:42.284 --> 13:44.867
Benny? We making a mistake
leaving the rev behind?

13:44.967 --> 13:46.348
This don't feel right.

13:46.448 --> 13:47.550
Nah, don't fall for it.

13:47.650 --> 13:48.991
This is some kind
of a trick.

13:49.091 --> 13:51.394
Oh, no!
I'm sinking instantly!

13:51.494 --> 13:52.915
This was a terrible plan!

13:53.015 --> 13:54.637
I've seen this one before.

13:54.737 --> 13:56.399
It's a classic
Dead Man Shuffle.

13:56.499 --> 13:58.401
Keep an eye on your wallets,
folks.

13:58.501 --> 13:59.642
I'm not a swimmer!

13:59.742 --> 14:01.684
I didn't grow up
around water!

14:01.784 --> 14:03.847
Huh. Not familiar
with this trick.

14:03.947 --> 14:05.448
Goodbye, world!

14:05.548 --> 14:08.151
[gurgling]

14:10.794 --> 14:13.457
Oh, I see.
He's just fully dying.

14:13.557 --> 14:16.079
Okay. Interesting.

14:18.682 --> 14:21.345
Help! Help!

14:21.445 --> 14:23.467
We have to do something!

14:23.567 --> 14:25.830
Are you crazy?
And risk our necks?

14:25.930 --> 14:28.272
- Help!
- PRU: Zeke!

14:28.372 --> 14:30.875
I'm coming for ya!
Hold on!

14:30.975 --> 14:32.356
Oh, yes! Yes!

14:32.456 --> 14:34.458
Now she's doing it?

14:36.100 --> 14:38.463
Come on, girl.
You got this.

14:40.865 --> 14:42.367
What is wrong
with these people?

14:42.467 --> 14:46.731
♪♪♪♪♪♪

14:46.831 --> 14:48.293
Oh, my God!

14:48.393 --> 14:51.777
- I got you.
- Oh, wow. You are very strong!

14:51.877 --> 14:54.019
- Swim, Prudence! Come on, girl!
- You can do it!

14:54.119 --> 14:55.621
Hey, hey, don't let them on!

14:55.721 --> 14:57.342
They're too heavy!
We'll sink!

14:57.442 --> 15:00.826
You shut your yap, Benny.
We're done listening to you.

15:00.926 --> 15:03.429
Everybody, start throwing
your stuff overboard!

15:03.529 --> 15:05.531
[grunting]

15:06.972 --> 15:08.974
Here we go.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.238
Craziest damn thing
I've ever seen!

15:12.338 --> 15:13.479
MARTHA:
Keep swimming!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.441
JOHN: Rev, hold on!

15:15.541 --> 15:17.543
GRANNY: You can do it!

15:21.948 --> 15:23.369
All right.

15:23.469 --> 15:26.152
Let's see what this morality
thing is all about.

15:29.556 --> 15:31.378
Hey! That was mine!

15:31.478 --> 15:33.540
Yeah, well,
that was pretty big for me.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.642
We all saw
where I was at earlier.

15:37.564 --> 15:39.867
JOHN: All right, let's get
these wagons on shore!

15:39.967 --> 15:42.790
Pru, you saved my life.

15:42.890 --> 15:45.032
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

15:45.132 --> 15:47.434
Did you see me out there?
I was all like,

15:47.534 --> 15:50.037
whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
"I got you, Zeke,"

15:50.137 --> 15:53.000
and then everyone was like,
"She's a hero! Oh, my God,

15:53.100 --> 15:55.163
I want to marry you, Prudence!
I worship you."

15:55.263 --> 15:56.444
For a near-death experience,

15:56.544 --> 15:57.605
there were a lot
of nice moments.

15:57.705 --> 15:59.867
- [chuckles]
- TODD: Prudence!

16:00.788 --> 16:01.930
Oh, shit.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.571
What the hell was that
back there?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.814
You embarrassed me in front
of our attractive new friends.

16:05.914 --> 16:08.096
I'm sorry, dear,
but I really just needed

16:08.196 --> 16:10.418
to do this for myself.
Okay?

16:10.518 --> 16:11.459
Hey, no.

16:11.559 --> 16:13.301
What has gotten into you?

16:13.401 --> 16:15.023
You openly disobey
your husband.

16:15.123 --> 16:17.506
You ruined
your pretty little dress.

16:17.606 --> 16:19.608
This is not the woman
I married.

16:21.650 --> 16:22.831
You're wrong, dear.

16:22.931 --> 16:25.434
This is the woman
you married.

16:25.534 --> 16:26.555
Get used to it.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.317
[yells]

16:28.417 --> 16:30.479
[laughter]

16:30.579 --> 16:33.262
[spluttering]
I'm wet!

16:34.623 --> 16:37.286
Oh, my beautiful dry skin
is ruined!

16:37.386 --> 16:38.488
It's ruined!

16:38.588 --> 16:41.210
[laughter continues]

16:41.310 --> 16:43.573
