WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:08.676
<i>- Previously on</i> Reacher...
- Well, whatever your friends

00:08.676 --> 00:10.052
were involved in was big enough
to get them killed.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.262
There's no way

00:11.262 --> 00:12.972
the Tony Swan I recruited
is a part of this.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.559
Seems Swan's title was
assistant director of security.

00:16.559 --> 00:19.687
"Shane Langston.
Director of Security."

00:19.687 --> 00:21.939
<i>Maybe he's the guy I got
on the phone in Atlantic City.</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:23.232
We need to talk
to Malcolm Lavoy.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.817
We'll never get close enough
to a senator

00:24.817 --> 00:26.235
to find out what
he may or may not know.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.445
Oh,
we don't need to.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.904
Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's

00:28.904 --> 00:30.072
legislative director.

00:30.072 --> 00:33.242
Little Wing can knock
anything out of the sky.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.410
New Age has two bases.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.203
Software made in New York,

00:36.203 --> 00:38.330
hardware at
a manufacturing plant in Denver.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.540
What are our directives?

00:39.540 --> 00:40.833
You and Dixon go to Denver.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.877
O'Donnell and I will
head down to D.C.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.588
<i>Want to swing by Homeland,
see what they know about A.M.</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:46.881
<i>Saddle up...</i>

00:48.007 --> 00:50.384
...'cause we're about to do
a whole lot of cowboy shit.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.645
Quit it!

01:01.645 --> 01:03.689
I'm gonna get you!

01:03.689 --> 01:06.776
- No, you're not.
- Don't drop my teddy ever again

01:06.776 --> 01:09.111
or I will...
...at your face.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.990
Stop it!

01:12.990 --> 01:15.034
Ooh.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.660
- You got the EpiPens?
- Yes, of course.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.537
- And woobie?
- Woobie, Panda-pal,

01:18.537 --> 01:19.789
Lindsay the Monkey,
they're all packed.

01:19.789 --> 01:21.081
Grab the burner phone.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.500
No contact with anyone.
Not your parents,

01:22.500 --> 01:23.959
and definitely not your sister.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.377
She puts everything on Facebook.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.004
- I know the drill.
- Go to Asheville.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.547
Take the boys.
Plenty for you to do there.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.090
It's touristy. You'll blend in.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.760
Use cash and
this pay-as-you-go credit card.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.845
Scale of one to ten,
how bad is this?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.680
They're not gonna
come after you.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.974
We're just playing it safe.
Belts and suspenders.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.726
One to ten.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.772
For you guys? Four, tops.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.357
How about you?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.734
Well, we're dealing with
some pretty bad guys, but...

01:48.734 --> 01:50.569
I got the gang with me.
We'll be fine.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.488
It'll be over in
a couple of days, promise.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.989
I got to get
the baby ready.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.746
Give my tie back!

02:00.746 --> 02:03.040
- I need...
- She doesn't panic.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.001
Accepts reality
on reality's terms.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.712
Daughter of an ER nurse,
Chicago fire chief.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.216
- Tough as they come.
- Beautiful, tough, smart.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.425
She lose a bet?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.345
...dinner.
That's what I'm making.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.763
If someone asked me
back in the day

02:17.763 --> 02:19.640
where I thought you'd wind up,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.600
I'd have predicted
a slow death from gonorrhea

02:21.600 --> 02:24.353
and a half dozen girlfriends
fighting over an '04 Miata.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.397
Yeah, well,
turns out I didn't want

02:26.397 --> 02:29.233
every girl in the world,
just the right one.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.615
Neagley and Dixon
just got to the Denver plant.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.617
Good. Maybe they get ahold
of those missiles

02:38.617 --> 02:40.995
and your family
won't have to be gone long.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.162
Whoa.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.622
You're a slowpoke.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.627
Okay.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.840
A few days wouldn't hurt.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.302
You'll never get me.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.803
I will.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.019
The DCMA was here a month ago.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.979
Yeah, and now we're back.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.648
We're the cold sores
of government oversight.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.151
Now, if you please?
Your foreman?

03:13.319 --> 03:14.737
Wait here.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.367
Never ceases to amaze me
how far you can get into a place

03:20.367 --> 03:22.369
if you just act like
you're supposed to be there

03:22.369 --> 03:24.121
and carry a clipboard.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.414
Mm-hmm.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.710
How you feeling?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.378
Sore.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.131
Well, fighting in heels
takes some getting used to.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.508
Walking in heels takes
some getting used to.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.510
Never wore 'em.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.472
- You never wore heels?
- Nope.

03:41.472 --> 03:44.767
- Not even to a school dance?
- Never went to one.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.395
When I wasn't studying or taking
care of my dad, I had to work.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.107
Well, bad music, warm punch
and some clammy hands

03:52.107 --> 03:54.109
feeling you up...

03:54.109 --> 03:56.028
you didn't miss much.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.285
Nobody told me about this.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.413
Wouldn't be a surprise
inspection if we called ahead.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.249
Uncle Sam wants to make sure
you're using his money wisely.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.876
So we're here to take a look

04:10.876 --> 04:13.921
at Little Wing shoulder-fired
launchers and missiles.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.798
The specs,
the manufacturing protocols,

04:15.798 --> 04:18.676
the order
and delivery schedules...

04:18.676 --> 04:21.011
Delivery schedule?

04:21.011 --> 04:23.472
Ten minutes ago.
That's the delivery schedule.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.766
The whole lot
just went out the door.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.477
All 650 of them.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.272
- 650?
- Here's the paperwork.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.276
If someone had called me first,
I'd have held them for you.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.241
- Shit.
- Yeah.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.941
Hey, there.
You need an extra set of hands?

05:15.941 --> 05:17.359
What I need

05:17.359 --> 05:18.944
is your truck.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.697
We're in business.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.875
Give me good news.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.543
<i>GPS tracker
did the job.</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:18.754
<i>Your associates
at New Age came through.</i>

06:18.754 --> 06:21.298
They might be upset
I killed the driver, though.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.550
Oh, they won't care
so long as they get paid.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.595
Never underestimate
the power of greed.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.388
Switch the trailers
and get on the road.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.016
Will do. Meet you in New York.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.522
This name, right here...

06:37.606 --> 06:38.816
...Azhari Mahmoud.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.071
So, the Aaron Miklos
we were chasing down in Denver,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.697
that was Mahmoud?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.616
Yeah, we've been
calling him "A.M."

06:47.616 --> 06:50.786
Guy's smart.
Never been caught, no photos.

06:50.786 --> 06:54.665
Hell, we're not even sure
what nationality he is.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.166
From the little bit
we know of him,

06:56.166 --> 06:58.210
he can supposedly pass
for Central American,

06:58.210 --> 07:00.504
Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.047
He's a ghost.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.800
We have three short,
innocuous recordings of him.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.344
Audio forensics matched it
as the same guy.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.304
Each time, he's using
a different identity.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.681
Ideology?

07:10.681 --> 07:13.225
No political
or religious affiliations.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.768
His only god is money,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.436
and he works
for the highest bidder.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.980
He hooks up bad actors
with the tools

07:17.980 --> 07:20.858
they need for bad actions.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.318
First popped up on our radar
six years ago.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.820
Terrorist cell caught
trying to acquire tanks

07:24.820 --> 07:26.697
of experimental nerve gas.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.740
We scooped up the whole lot.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.784
All of them except Mahmoud.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.246
Or whatever his name is.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.539
Ghost.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.169
This buy was supposed to happen
with bearer bonds.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.588
Yeah, financial instrument
of choice for tax evaders,

07:42.588 --> 07:45.799
money launderers
and other assorted assholes.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.385
The U.S. Treasury stopped
issuing those in the '80s.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.180
Some countries still use them.
Those were from Luxembourg.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.183
Someone as cautious as A.M.
would use bearer bonds.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.642
If issued
in large enough amounts,

07:55.642 --> 07:58.103
you can carry an untraceable
fortune in a briefcase.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.564
- 65 million worth.
- That's the problem.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.982
You hold a bearer bond,
that's like carrying

08:01.982 --> 08:03.567
a million dollar bill.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.402
The bearer owns it.

08:05.402 --> 08:09.198
So no way A.M. lets anyone
deliver payment but him.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.616
That's where he's vulnerable.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.409
Just like your brother.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.747
Back when we worked the case,
I asked Joe

08:16.747 --> 08:19.166
some questions
of the financial side of things.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.335
He said same thing you just did.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.921
A.M. will be the delivery boy.
No one else.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.839
Okay.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.717
We showed you ours.
Now it's your turn.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.143
We're still piecing it
together, but, uh...

08:38.143 --> 08:40.979
we give you our word,
when this bird's cooked,

08:40.979 --> 08:42.606
- we'll reach out.
- And you have my word

08:42.606 --> 08:44.942
we won't let this guy
slip through our fingers again.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.777
A.M. and everyone
working with him

08:46.777 --> 08:49.947
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.326
Unless we kill them all first.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.582
Thanks, guys.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.507
Just like his brother.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.331
18-wheelers can't go that fast
on these roads.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.125
We've got a decent shot
at catching them.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.007
Yeah, especially
if they come to a stop.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.099
Who are these guys?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.517
They're the guys
who are gonna tell us

10:00.517 --> 10:02.060
the truck broke down
and they had to call

10:02.060 --> 10:04.354
another one to come
pick up the trailer.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.065
But no way a second truck
got here before us.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.068
- No.
- This is a hijacking.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.739
Any chance you're wrong?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.826
I'm not wrong!

10:17.826 --> 10:19.703
How the fuck did they know
who we are?

10:19.703 --> 10:22.914
Foreman must've called New Age
about two government inspectors.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.751
Langston finds out
and calls these dickheads.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.631
The fuck?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.189
Ah!

11:37.322 --> 11:40.117
- I think we got him.
- Yeah.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.787
Also looks like we got
a front tire and gas tank.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.583
- We're not getting out of here.
- No.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.919
- I'll call the cops.
- Make it anonymous.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.838
Copy that. Do me a favor,
grab the manifest.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.465
We need the license plate
off of it.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.438
Oh, shit.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.859
What's up, Neagley?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.902
Hell of a lot, actually.
We got to talk fast,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.529
because cops are on the way
to a body count

12:17.529 --> 12:19.573
and we got to put some distance
between us and them.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.658
Anything to put you
at the scene?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.702
<i>Rental car. It was shot to hell,</i>

12:23.702 --> 12:25.120
but it was rented
with Dixon's fake ID.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.289
We torched it to get rid
of prints and DNA.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.416
Good.
So what happened out there?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.252
- <i>You want the bad news
or the worse news?</i>
- Surprise us.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.922
Well, a New Age truck with all
650 missiles in it was hijacked.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.134
I hope that's the worse news.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.720
You wish. Tony Swan's alive.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.346
- So that's a good thing.
<i>- No.</i>

12:43.346 --> 12:45.599
It looks like Swan's
still working with New Age.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.850
According to the bill of lading,

12:46.850 --> 12:48.518
Swan personally signed off
on the shipment

12:48.518 --> 12:50.896
- <i>before it left the factory.</i>
- So he's in Denver?

12:50.896 --> 12:53.064
No, the paperwork said
he authorized it from New York.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.733
So they forged his signature.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.486
- <i>It's a digital thumbprint.</i>
- Then they forced him.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.404
<i>New Age New York has
iris scanners on the doors,</i>

12:59.404 --> 13:01.364
thumbprint locks
on the computers.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.867
There's no way that anyone
could force Tony Swan

13:03.867 --> 13:07.412
through that maze of biometrics
without causing a huge scene.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.997
The only way they wouldn't
worry about a ruckus

13:08.997 --> 13:10.832
is if all
thousand-plus employees

13:10.832 --> 13:12.042
were in on this thing,

13:12.042 --> 13:13.543
<i>and the odds of a conspiracy</i>

13:13.543 --> 13:15.462
- <i>that vast are...</i>
- Minimal.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.675
I know you want to believe
Swan's clean, boss, we all do,

13:20.675 --> 13:22.636
<i>but things look
the way they look.</i>

13:22.636 --> 13:24.554
<i>Talk when we're safe, okay?</i>

13:25.597 --> 13:27.265
Reacher?

13:29.601 --> 13:32.395
Copy that.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.773
So what you said
about killing them all...

13:35.857 --> 13:37.317
...that include Tony Swan?

13:42.113 --> 13:43.740
I'm going for a walk.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.586
You boys won't be needing these.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.839
Yeah, we're all friends here.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.969
<i>Took their guns.</i>

14:03.969 --> 14:05.554
Long as they didn't find
the wire Swan's wearing,

14:05.554 --> 14:07.180
we're five by five.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.433
Like that miscreant said,
"We're all friends here."

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186
Let's see what you got,
G.I. Joe.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.522
G.I. Joe?
More like <i>Mighty Joe Young.</i>

14:15.522 --> 14:16.898
How'd you like to be jammed
into a foxhole

14:16.898 --> 14:18.608
with this giant motherfucker?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.735
<i>We'll beat whatever
price you're paying now.</i>

14:20.735 --> 14:22.362
Our supplier can get you
all the H you can move

14:22.362 --> 14:23.780
from an overseas source

14:23.780 --> 14:25.865
that's in no position
to negotiate terms.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.535
We pass the savings on to you.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.386
Okay.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.347
- <i>Let's talk money.</i>
- Soon as they agree
to a deal, we go.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.724
Bust them,
lean on them,

14:50.724 --> 14:52.851
they give up their source;
we bust them,

14:52.851 --> 14:54.269
then we all get bumped.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.729
More fruit salad
on our chests...

14:55.729 --> 14:58.607
More dollar signs
on our paychecks, bro.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.026
Why would they add dollar signs
to our paychecks?

15:01.026 --> 15:03.069
- Shut up, Franzy.
- The kid's got a point, Manuel.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.529
You only need one dollar sign.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.324
- Assholes.
- Heads up.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.617
We got incoming.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.052
About time.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.681
<i>110?</i>

15:31.681 --> 15:33.433
You said you could beat
our current price.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.519
- I am beating it.
- Not by enough.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.521
You want us to change
suppliers, motivate us.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.731
This is chicken. I said pork.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.149
- You heard me order it.
- Okay.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.233
Fucking idiots
always get it wrong.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.485
How's 105?

15:43.485 --> 15:45.612
Sounds like you're wasting
my fucking time.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.821
- You got forks?
- You have
another brick

15:46.821 --> 15:49.199
- as pure as that for 105?
- Seen better.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.950
Bullshit.
I got a list of other buyers

15:50.950 --> 15:53.203
- a mile long. I came to you...
- I know you.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.579
...because you purchase
at a volume,

15:54.579 --> 15:55.580
- which makes it worthwhile.
- I don't think so.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.623
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

15:56.623 --> 15:57.791
<i>Where do I know you from?</i>

15:57.791 --> 15:59.084
- Uh-oh.
- Hold on.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.586
- Might be nothing.
- No idea.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.921
- Look, I have
other offers coming in.
- I know we've met before.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.590
What can you do for me?

16:05.590 --> 16:08.051
100. Take it or leave it.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.553
I got it. You're the guy I sold
my guitar to a while back.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.810
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.687
Craigslist, dude.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.146
You bought my acoustic.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.819
We gonna eat
and discuss old times

16:25.819 --> 16:27.445
or are we gonna make a deal?

16:27.445 --> 16:28.738
You assholes
don't want this stuff,

16:28.738 --> 16:30.073
we got other places
we can sell it.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.743
Wait a minute.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.287
Wait a minute,
when this guy bought it,

16:36.287 --> 16:38.540
he was in an Army cop uniform.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.595
Fuck.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.889
Go, go, go, go.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.892
Look out!

17:00.812 --> 17:02.021
Don't shoot!

17:04.357 --> 17:05.984
- Call an ambulance!
- Don't shoot!

17:05.984 --> 17:07.652
We have an officer down.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.113
- We need medical assistance.
- The bullet missed your heart.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.074
But shattered my collarbone.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.909
Not gonna be playing
that guitar for a while.

17:14.909 --> 17:18.705
- Every cloud...
- Fuck you.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.541
- Hey, who don't you mess with?
- The Teamsters?

17:26.254 --> 17:28.089
I owe you one.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.483
Let me guess.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.276
Government plates,
government suits,

17:48.276 --> 17:50.111
government rides.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.821
Surprised it took
Senator Lavoy this long

17:51.821 --> 17:54.073
to figure out who sweated
his flunky last night.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.035
The senator has a proposition
for you. Get in.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.953
No.

17:58.953 --> 18:02.916
- Why not, Mr. Reacher?
- Just "Reacher."

18:02.916 --> 18:06.336
Fine, Reacher.
Why won't you get in the car?

18:06.336 --> 18:08.254
Because he didn't ask nicely.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.923
Okay.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.675
Hart, what's the magic word?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.764
Please get in the vehicle?

18:32.403 --> 18:35.114
<i>My man in Denver barely
got away with the merchandise.</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:37.992
I'm paying a premium
for a seamless transaction,

18:37.992 --> 18:41.037
and so far this has been
anything but seamless.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.455
If these problems persist,

18:42.455 --> 18:44.332
there may have to be
a price adjustment.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.418
Some of Mr. Swan's old friends
are causing us problems,

18:47.418 --> 18:49.337
but it's nothing
we can't handle.

18:49.337 --> 18:53.132
If you want the merchandise,
you honor the deal.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.051
<i>Do what you promised and I will.</i>

18:57.053 --> 19:00.473
Okay. Good.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.100
Where are you now?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.853
I am just outside...

19:04.853 --> 19:06.479
Oh, no, t-this can't be right.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.648
"French Lick"?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.734
- Fucking Americans.
- <i>Indiana.</i>

19:11.734 --> 19:14.153
Okay.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.989
The Little Wing chips
will be ready to install

19:15.989 --> 19:18.324
in the missiles
by the time you get here.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.327
And Mr. Swan's associates
will be taken care of.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.038
That plan's already in motion.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.502
Fuck your king. Prick.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.264
Backstage
at the primate exhibit?

19:41.264 --> 19:42.849
Dramatic.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.476
Thought you might feel
comfortable among the gorillas.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.147
Mr. Reacher, I'm Malcolm Lavoy.

19:49.147 --> 19:52.108
- He prefers just "Reacher."
- No.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.693
He has to call me "Mister."

19:53.693 --> 19:55.403
My apologies
for the manner in which

19:55.403 --> 19:58.281
you were brought in here,
Mr. Reacher.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.450
Assume you use this location
'cause it's one

20:00.450 --> 20:02.285
of the few spots in D.C.
where you can meet

20:02.285 --> 20:04.329
without prying eyes
or surveillance bugs.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.415
Mm-hmm. It's why I got myself
appointed to the zoo's board.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.709
Ah, I believe you know

20:09.709 --> 20:11.002
my legislative director,
Mr. Boyd.

20:11.002 --> 20:14.839
Yeah, he's the one
who likes cocaine.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.925
You know,
when I found out what happened,

20:16.925 --> 20:19.427
I reached out to a friend
of mine at the Bureau.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.180
Imagine Boyd's embarrassment
when he learned

20:22.180 --> 20:24.933
that the people
he revealed our secrets to

20:24.933 --> 20:26.851
weren't FBI agents
in the first place.

20:26.851 --> 20:30.813
Security video showed you
entering the precinct

20:30.813 --> 20:35.068
and facial recognition software
matched you to a military ID.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.279
Jack Reacher. No middle name.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.032
West Point, two Silver Stars,

20:41.032 --> 20:43.534
a Bronze Star,
Purple Heart and so on.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.244
Show some respect.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.747
That is quite a list,
and I want to thank you

20:47.747 --> 20:49.749
for your service, by the way.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.167
Seems like after you retired,

20:51.167 --> 20:53.086
you kind of fell off
the face of the Earth.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.922
Except for this incident
a couple years ago

20:55.922 --> 20:57.340
in Margrave, Georgia.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.760
Charged with the murder
of your own brother.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.221
You were,
of course, exonerated.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.349
Then a massive
counterfeiting operation

21:06.349 --> 21:08.226
that Joe had been investigating

21:08.226 --> 21:11.396
literally and figuratively
burned to the ground.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.106
Now, the official story was

21:13.106 --> 21:15.566
that it was all the work
of a rookie cop

21:15.566 --> 21:17.568
and an out-of-town veteran.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.404
The same out-of-town veteran

21:19.404 --> 21:21.322
that arrested Boyd here
in Boston.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.865
Get to the point.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.368
Smells like monkey shit in here.

21:25.368 --> 21:29.163
Well, I know it was you
in Margrave, Mr. Reacher.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.458
I want you to do the same thing
for the situation we have here.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.343
- Why?
- Because in Boston,
you insinuated to Boyd

21:42.343 --> 21:44.345
that military
and civilian aircraft

21:44.345 --> 21:46.222
could be in danger
due to Little Wing.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.099
Now, I can only assume
that means that terrorists

21:48.099 --> 21:51.019
are interested in the tech,
working hard to obtain it.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.563
See, once we identified you,
we looked into things deeper

21:53.563 --> 21:55.898
and we learned that
your old unit's back together,

21:55.898 --> 21:58.359
and some are dead.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.319
Don't look so shocked,
Mr. Reacher,

22:00.319 --> 22:02.613
I'm a U.S. congressman,
I get things done.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.950
I'm shocked because a U.S.
congressman got anything done.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.705
I'm used to the slings
and arrows, Mr. Reacher.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.332
But bottom line,

22:13.332 --> 22:15.626
the people
who want this weaponry

22:15.626 --> 22:17.170
can never be allowed to have it.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.796
Because if anyone knew

22:18.796 --> 22:20.339
you were involved
in the shady dealings

22:20.339 --> 22:22.675
that created Little Wing
in the first place,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.093
you'd be indicted.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.429
Get rid of the bad guys,
keep my hands clean.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.347
In Washington,
we call that a win-win.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.602
I did what I did to give
our side the tools they need

22:32.602 --> 22:34.520
to defend democracy.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.023
I just avoided the typical
red tape that does nothing

22:37.023 --> 22:39.650
but cause the delays
that cost lives.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.611
And lined your pockets
in the process.

22:41.611 --> 22:44.572
Again, win-win.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.283
But I don't want innocent people
to die because of it.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.369
I'm a political animal,
I'm not a monster, Mr. Reacher.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.247
And I'm not asking
for your help,

22:53.247 --> 22:55.166
I'm offering you mine.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.752
You're the kind of man who likes
to gets things done, too.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.421
Your record in the military,
and in Margrave, proves that.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.465
You like to upset
the apple cart.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.675
Well, I'm prepared to give you
whatever you need

23:04.675 --> 23:07.178
to aid you in that endeavor.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.180
And when you're done,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.182
no one will be able to prove
that you were ever near

23:11.182 --> 23:12.934
those apples in the first place.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.396
Just smash this thing to bits.
Leave no man left standing.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.024
No one left to endanger lives.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.777
And then you can
disappear again.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.987
No one will go looking for you.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.906
Or your friends.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.267
Yeah?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.644
Hey, Not-So-Jolly Green Giant.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.188
<i>- You throw away that suit yet?</i>
- No. Why?

23:59.188 --> 24:01.232
<i>Coroner finally
released Franz's body.</i>

24:01.232 --> 24:03.234
Funeral's tomorrow.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.153
We got to go back to New York.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.791
Had my office make
some discrete inquiries.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.293
Denver sheriffs
found the shot-up truck

24:20.293 --> 24:21.711
with a switched-out trailer.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.212
Nothing in it
but crates of bricks.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.672
Guessing they
perfectly matched the weight

24:24.672 --> 24:25.882
of the launchers
and the missiles.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.884
Yep.
It seems their plan

24:27.884 --> 24:29.594
was to drive the dummy cargo
down to the port

24:29.594 --> 24:31.262
- in L.A.
- And ship it to an Army base

24:31.262 --> 24:34.891
in the Philippines or wherever
the weapons were supposed to go.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.310
South Korea, according
to the documents we saw.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.811
[scoffs] Smart.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.855
Three to four weeks
for a cargo ship to get there

24:40.855 --> 24:43.524
from the West Coast, no one
knows the weapons were missing

24:43.524 --> 24:45.234
till they open it up
on the other end.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.944
And who knows how long
that could be?

24:46.944 --> 24:48.362
Army could just
load it into storage

24:48.362 --> 24:49.614
and not see them again
for months.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.490
And by then, it's too late.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.326
Terrorists have taken down
dozens of planes

24:53.326 --> 24:55.453
and we have no idea
where they got the firepower.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.413
Speaking of firepower,
we have any leads

24:57.413 --> 24:58.831
as to where
the real missiles went?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.333
Colorado State Police
found the truck

25:00.333 --> 25:01.959
in a field outside Denver.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.961
- It was empty.
- Based on the tracks
in the dirt,

25:03.961 --> 25:07.256
they think a private plane
flew the weapons out overnight.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.758
Could be headed here.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.218
Since 9/11, they've kept
a pretty close watch

25:10.218 --> 25:11.636
on New York's skies.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.346
And we know A.M.'s cautious.

25:13.346 --> 25:17.016
I were him, I'd fly
them into some small airstrip

25:17.016 --> 25:18.684
in Pennsylvania,
maybe New Hampshire,

25:18.684 --> 25:20.436
then drive the weapons
into New York to load them up

25:20.436 --> 25:22.855
- with the Little Wing software.
- That makes sense.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.815
We need to know exactly
where the missiles are headed

25:24.815 --> 25:26.525
so we can intercept them.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.444
'Cause when the money
changes hands,

25:28.444 --> 25:31.822
A.M. will be there, and so will
the people who killed our guys.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.624
Reacher. You seeing this shit?

25:41.624 --> 25:43.960
Isn't that that toy he had
in his car the other day?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.795
Mikey.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.713
My nephews have the same one.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.882
It's a great toy.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.885
We play with it all the time.

25:52.885 --> 25:57.181
When I was a kid, I had Aquaman.

25:57.181 --> 26:01.394
I thought it was so cool
how he could talk to fish.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.479
'Cause I wanted to talk
to my dog, you know?

26:10.569 --> 26:11.821
Hey.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.783
I want you to have this, too.

26:15.783 --> 26:19.370
This was mine. Saint Jerome.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.830
He's the patron saint of kids

26:20.830 --> 26:23.249
whose moms and dads
go to heaven.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.252
I want you to say the prayer...

26:28.254 --> 26:30.589
...on the back,

26:30.589 --> 26:33.509
every night.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.012
It'll help keep your dad close.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.808
Can you do that?

26:42.810 --> 26:44.228
Good boy.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.857
Good boy.

26:50.318 --> 26:53.321
You need anything, you call me.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.947
Day or night.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.533
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.953
Come on, Mikey.
They're just about to start.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.751
Why are you giving toys
to my dead friend's son?

27:06.751 --> 27:08.419
Excuse me?

27:08.419 --> 27:12.506
Cozy up to the kid,
score points with Mom.

27:12.506 --> 27:16.510
You see a grieving widow
and think, "Easy target"?

27:16.510 --> 27:18.512
Are you kidding me right now?

27:18.512 --> 27:20.890
You got some kind of death wish?

27:20.890 --> 27:23.684
- Some people think so.
- I'm here to pay my respects.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.187
Why did a biker gang take a run
at me in Boston last night?

27:26.187 --> 27:28.564
- 'Cause you're an asshole.
- Possibly.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.316
Or maybe it's 'cause
you're the only person I told

27:30.316 --> 27:32.318
- we were going there.
- Wait, wait, wait.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.695
Are you trying to say
that I'm bent?

27:34.695 --> 27:36.739
Not <i>trying</i> to say anything.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.826
You know why I was
talking to Mikey?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.661
Because I know what
he's going through.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.872
I know what it is to look out
the window every night

27:44.872 --> 27:46.624
and pray that the next
set of headlights

27:46.624 --> 27:48.250
coming down the street
is your father's car,

27:48.250 --> 27:50.252
even though you know
it'll never happen,

27:50.252 --> 27:52.713
because you saw the guys
from Romano's funeral home

27:52.713 --> 27:54.840
throw dirt on his casket.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.717
Do you know what it is
to lose family?

27:56.717 --> 27:59.553
Yeah, they're all dead.
Every one of them.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.139
And I was talking about you,
not your father.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.516
I'm talking about him.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.893
My father was a cop, a good one,

28:05.893 --> 28:08.646
and he refused to be on the take
and they killed him for it.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.529
Look, I know that's
your friend's son and widow.

28:16.529 --> 28:17.738
I get it.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.448
But you call me dirty
one more time,

28:19.448 --> 28:20.866
and I don't care
if we're standing

28:20.866 --> 28:22.785
in front of the statue
of the Holy Mother,

28:22.785 --> 28:25.955
I will give you that beating
that I owe you right here.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.834
One, I'll take that fight
any time you want.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.545
And two...

28:32.545 --> 28:34.422
I didn't know that
about your father.

28:34.422 --> 28:36.715
Yeah, well, what you don't know
could fill the Javits.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.427
Because while you were in Boston
doing God knows what,

28:39.427 --> 28:42.096
I was running those
security names from New Age.

28:42.096 --> 28:45.433
All former NYPD,
all from the 3rd precinct.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.685
The boss, Langston
and a few other guys,

28:47.685 --> 28:49.603
they were under investigation
by IA.

28:49.603 --> 28:52.356
They took early retirement
and the charges went away.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.567
Then they all got
cushy jobs at New Age,

28:54.567 --> 28:56.444
and they hired
all their pals along.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.862
Whole team of bad cops?

28:57.862 --> 28:59.780
Everybody except
your buddy Swan.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.782
But he's the only one
that has military experience

29:01.782 --> 29:04.326
to know what type of weapons
terrorists want, so...

29:04.326 --> 29:06.454
Now you're implying something
that's pissing me off.

29:06.454 --> 29:08.372
You can't deny
he makes sense for this.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.875
With his background,
for all we know,

29:10.875 --> 29:12.418
he might have put
the whole thing together.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.754
All cops, all bad,
all from the same precinct.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.507
- You interview any of them?
- Couldn't.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.718
You turned their office
into a drive-through.

29:20.718 --> 29:21.927
They went to the ground.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.389
Their places were empty,
just like Tony Swan's.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.808
You want to call somebody dirty?

29:27.808 --> 29:29.685
First look in your own backyard.

29:38.652 --> 29:43.073
We therefore commit our brother
Calvin Franz to the ground,

29:43.073 --> 29:47.328
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

29:47.328 --> 29:50.831
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

29:50.831 --> 29:52.666
to the eternal life.

29:52.666 --> 29:53.959
Amen.

30:23.531 --> 30:25.866
Firing party, attention.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.745
Stand by.

30:33.082 --> 30:34.291
Ready.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.630
Aim.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.257
Fire.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.384
Ready.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.718
Aim.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.845
Fire.

30:50.099 --> 30:51.517
- Get down!
- Fire...

30:54.103 --> 30:55.938
I got you. Come on. Let's go.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.273
Get out of here. Go.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.650
Active shooters! Run!

31:13.622 --> 31:15.791
How many?

31:15.791 --> 31:18.377
As far as I can tell, two.
Across the road.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.254
Handguns are useless from this
distance. We got to get closer.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.256
Flank them. Neagley and I will
take the one on the right.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.882
You two take
the one on the left.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.301
Go.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.242
Close as we're gonna get.
It's not enough.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.828
- We could wait for the cops.
- We can't let them get away.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.955
As soon as they hear sirens,
they scatter.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.709
All right.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.544
I'll draw their fire,
you take them out.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.254
- Negative.
- You can do this.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.174
- You're a great shot.
- But you're a slow runner.

32:16.977 --> 32:18.812
Fuck this.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.800
Get in!

32:52.721 --> 32:55.391
So, you trust me now,
or are you just desperate?

32:55.391 --> 32:57.142
I saw you protect
Angela and Mikey,

32:57.142 --> 32:58.936
so I guess
you're playing it square.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.399
You got a rat in your house,
though, that's for sure.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.533
Shit, Russo,
it's the pedal on the right.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.118
Let me do my job.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.290
- Cut the corner.
- There's a curb.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.502
- Jump the curb!
- Will you climb out of my ass?

33:30.551 --> 33:32.886
I thought this was supposed
to be a high-speed pursuit.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.229
You're losing our best lead.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.148
You want to drive?

33:44.148 --> 33:46.984
- Yes.
- Hey, hey.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.673
You're a fucking menace,
you know that?

34:09.673 --> 34:10.966
You drive like you're blind.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.513
Don't shoot. I'm done.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.183
Okay? I'm done.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.685
You're under arrest, asshole.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.188
No.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.606
These guys took a run at us
in broad daylight

34:25.606 --> 34:27.024
at a crowded funeral.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.567
They're getting desperate.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.569
Means this thing's
coming to a head fast.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.820
We take him in, he lawyers up

34:31.820 --> 34:33.447
and doesn't talk
until it's too late

34:33.447 --> 34:34.782
and a terrorist has 650 chances

34:34.782 --> 34:36.283
to take down
a commercial airliner.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.659
So, what do you want me to do?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.328
Look the other way.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.293
Oh, come on, man.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.506
By not telling me
everything you know,

34:50.506 --> 34:52.800
you're protecting the people
who killed my friends.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.051
I'm not gonna waste my time

34:54.051 --> 34:56.011
with enhanced
interrogation techniques.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.846
I'm just gonna squeeze
the life out of you.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.932
So, if at any point
before you die

34:59.932 --> 35:03.227
you feel like fully
unburdening yourself...

35:03.227 --> 35:04.853
blink.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.529
- Talk, now.
- Okay.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.239
Okay. Christ.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.115
Let me catch my breath.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.955
We were supposed
to use the gunfire

35:22.955 --> 35:25.833
from the 21-gun salute
to mask our shot.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.584
Take you and your team down
and get out of there

35:27.584 --> 35:29.253
before anyone knew
what was going on.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.505
Easy payday for a couple
professional hitters.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.757
- Tell me something
I don't know.
- Like what?

35:33.757 --> 35:35.425
Langston wouldn't give you
all the cash up front.

35:35.425 --> 35:36.635
Where are you supposed
to meet him

35:36.635 --> 35:37.845
to get the rest of the money?

35:37.845 --> 35:39.429
An abandoned building

35:39.429 --> 35:41.431
in some shitty neighborhood
in Queens.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.892
Look, I-I can take you there.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.853
But I don't know any Langston.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.813
Then who hired you?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.648
Some guy called Swan.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.534
Copy that.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.369
Dixon and O'Donnell
are in position.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.912
Russo's down the street.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.290
- All exits are covered.
- Hear that?

36:06.290 --> 36:08.417
You try anything,
you'll be sorry.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.836
But you go in there, get paid,
give us the rundown...

36:10.836 --> 36:12.921
How many inside,
what they're packing...

36:12.921 --> 36:15.257
Layout of the room,
where everyone's sitting...

36:15.257 --> 36:17.467
We'll cut you loose
and you get to keep the cash.

36:17.467 --> 36:20.679
- Understood?
- Yeah, man. Whatever.

36:20.679 --> 36:24.266
I just never want
to see you people again.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.351
Give me your phone.

36:32.024 --> 36:35.694
Keep this in your pocket
so we can listen in.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.321
You try anything, we come in hot

36:37.321 --> 36:40.032
and you die
with the rest of them.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.117
Get going, stupid.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.044
So,
what are we thinking?

36:52.044 --> 36:54.087
Swan went to work for New Age,

36:54.087 --> 36:55.505
saw a chance to make
the kind of money

36:55.505 --> 36:57.424
he always dreamed of
and took it?

36:57.424 --> 36:59.676
Then what?
He was hanging out with Franzy,

36:59.676 --> 37:01.595
them being
in the same city and all,

37:01.595 --> 37:05.349
slipped and said something
that made Franz suspicious?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.351
Or...

37:07.351 --> 37:08.936
tried to get Franz in on it?

37:08.936 --> 37:11.563
Figured with a wife and kid,
he'd need the money, too.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.316
Franz said no, tried to stop it,

37:14.316 --> 37:16.401
called Sanchez
and Orozco for help.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.028
That sound about right?

37:18.028 --> 37:20.614
I don't know,

37:20.614 --> 37:22.032
but if Swan's really
in that building,

37:22.032 --> 37:24.034
I'm gonna do the same thing
I did to that guy.

37:24.034 --> 37:25.619
Wrap my hand around his neck

37:25.619 --> 37:27.371
and squeeze the truth
out of him.

37:27.371 --> 37:28.997
And after that?

37:34.044 --> 37:35.462
Hello?

37:36.880 --> 37:38.882
