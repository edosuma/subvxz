The world has changed.

Not in Cento.
Not even Italy.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.387
We find a place in the city.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
A little apartment.
And a garage.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.130
What about the farm?

05:48.173 --> 05:50.219
I don't want it, Papa.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.920
Give it to them.
They've worked for it.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.620
I have an idea
to start a company.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.361
To build tractors.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.451
Smaller, cheaper tractors

06:04.494 --> 06:06.931
than the ones
that are being made now.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.542
You're a farmer.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.720
You think I was a farmer
in the war, Papa?

06:12.763 --> 06:15.287
I was a mechanic.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.855
I learned about machines,
about cars and engines.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.466
Did I raise a fool?

06:19.509 --> 06:22.556
The only company
that sells tractors in Cento

06:22.599 --> 06:25.776
is Cugini Randi.
Everyone knows that.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.125
But they don't have
the best tractors.

06:27.169 --> 06:28.649
They have the only tractors.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.346
If I make a better tractor,
for less money,

06:30.390 --> 06:31.608
people will buy mine.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.395
We have a plan, Papa.

06:35.438 --> 06:38.049
We're going to race
in the Terra dei Motori.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.444
And if we win, when we win,

06:41.488 --> 06:42.706
we'll use the prestige

06:42.750 --> 06:44.795
to raise the money
for the first tractor.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.755
- Who is we?
- Matteo and me.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.845
- Who's Matteo?
- My friend.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.543
- You have a race car?
- We're going to make one.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.675
You can make a car?

06:54.718 --> 06:57.678
We're buying
an old Topolino for nothing.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.724
We're redesigning the engine,
increasing the displacement.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.945
Turning the 500cc into a 650cc.

07:03.988 --> 07:08.471
I have also an idea
for a new cylinder head,
with overhead valves.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.647
I can make it with bronze.
Cheap, easy.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.737
It'll be as fast or faster

07:13.781 --> 07:15.086
than any car in the race, Papa.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.743
I can do this.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.180
I can make the lives
of every farmer like you better.

07:24.531 --> 07:28.448
With a tractor, you can compete
with the big companies.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.191
How do you know
your tractor will work?

07:33.235 --> 07:34.192
We'll make it work.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.846
How do you know it'll be cheap?

07:35.890 --> 07:38.066
We'll make it cheap.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.938
Papa, even the government
knows the world has changed.

07:40.982 --> 07:44.159
It's helping new companies
with loans to rebuild Italy.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.557
And if nobody
buys your tractors?

07:50.600 --> 07:54.082
"A man who's not in debt
has no reason to work."

07:54.125 --> 07:56.650
How many times
have you told me that?

08:00.349 --> 08:02.482
It's not impossible
what I'm talking about.

08:02.525 --> 08:06.747
The sun rises
and the sun sets for most men,
and they die.

08:06.790 --> 08:11.403
But for some, for great men,
their name lives on.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.282
I want the Lamborghini name
to live on.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.894

to never forget my name.

than in search of greatness.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.607
I'll pay it back.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.228
I don't have much.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.101
But I'll give you what I have.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.239
It's not enough, Papa.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.503
I have an idea.
It will be hard.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.419
But it will work.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.117
This time I know it will work.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.293
I promise.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.427
If you do this,
I'll pay it back with interest.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.125
Interest?

20:58.387 --> 20:59.432
Yes.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.091
[sighs]

22:07.804 --> 22:09.328
He mortgaged the farm?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.158
You asked him to do this?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
He's my father.

22:15.812 --> 22:19.555
He's a husband to your mother
and a father to your brothers.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.122
I'll pay it back.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.776
That's not the point.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.952
It is not his to give you.

22:24.995 --> 22:28.085
It is your brothers'.
It is their farm.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.958
They worked for it.
Their whole lives
they worked for it.

22:31.001 --> 22:34.570
You said it yourself.
They deserve it.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.137
You don't believe in me?

22:36.180 --> 22:38.748
I believe in you, Ferruccio.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.316
I believe in you more than
you believe in yourself.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.058
But we will find another way.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.192
This is selfish.

22:48.236 --> 22:51.152
You will not put the future
of your family in danger.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.852
They have their own dreams.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.985
I would never let them
lose their farm.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.682
Things go wrong.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.859
No matter your intentions,
things go wrong.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.515
Don't do this, Ferruccio!

23:08.082 --> 23:10.693
No good will come of it,
I can feel it.

23:12.565 --> 23:16.090
He only gave it to you
because you asked him.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.657
He gave it to me
because he believes in me.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.399
No. Because he pities you.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.317
Give it back.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.499
He won't take it back.
I know him.

23:33.542 --> 23:38.634
Then you go to
the bank yourself,
and deposit it in his account.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.430
[door opens, closes]

24:18.892 --> 24:20.067
[door closes]

24:20.110 --> 24:21.677
I'll take the next customer.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.505
[phone ringing]

24:26.595 --> 24:30.120
Ferruccio! It's Vito.
Vito Rossi!

24:30.164 --> 24:31.513
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.906
- How've you been?
- Good.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.125
How's your father?
Your brothers?

24:35.169 --> 24:36.475
Very good.
Everybody's good.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.433
Excellent. Have a seat.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.610
So, what can I do for you?

24:41.654 --> 24:43.351
I'd like to open an account.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.613
Of course.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.487
In your name, I assume.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.883
Ferruccio in what name
would you like the account.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.671
My name... Ferruccio.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.413
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.198
- Great.
- [phone continues ringing]

25:04.241 --> 25:05.852
Can I smoke a cigarette?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.114
Of course.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.302
- Take that... [mutters]
- Okay.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.391
[jazzy music playing]

25:25.828 --> 25:27.526
[chattering indistinct]

25:37.623 --> 25:39.799
[jazzy music continues on radio]

25:42.802 --> 25:45.935
[humming to music]

26:03.518 --> 26:06.695
Carioca.
That's what we call it.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.916
- Hm.
- Small enough for a farmer
to use anywhere,

26:09.959 --> 26:12.745
and strong enough
for any company to want.

26:12.788 --> 26:16.183
With this kind of power,
it will take a lot of gasoline.

26:16.226 --> 26:20.622
We start with the Morris
four-cylinder 1548 cc.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.973
Yeah, of course.
What we talked about.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.541
Here's what
we didn't talk about.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.239
- Two fuel tanks?
- Yes.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.632
Oh, fuck.

26:31.894 --> 26:32.852
Listen...

26:34.984 --> 26:36.682
- we start on gasoline.
- Mm-hm.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.641
But when the exhaust manifold
warms enough,

26:39.685 --> 26:44.603
we can cut off the gasoline
and release petroleum
from this tank.

26:44.646 --> 26:51.305
Maybe. The coil
would have to be hot enough
to vaporize the petroleum

26:51.348 --> 26:53.699
before it gets into
the carburetor.

26:53.742 --> 26:56.092
That's why
it'll be a copper coil.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.881
So, two types of fuel.
One cheap, one expensive.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.534
And a copper coil.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.015
Exactly.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.628
I don't know.
Can it work?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.021
Of course it can work.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.155
- How do you know?
- We make it work.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.461
[chuckles]

27:17.505 --> 27:19.812
- A hybrid?
- Mm-hm.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.553
That-that's exciting.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.643
A hybrid for our Carioca.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.775
- Carioca.
- Carioca.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.647
Ah, fuck!

27:37.786 --> 27:38.744
This one.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.094
Hm?

27:44.271 --> 27:46.055
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:46.099 --> 27:47.578
Okay.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.713
So, it's for sale?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.106
Make a bid.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.330
[upbeat music playing]

28:08.338 --> 28:09.688
Keep going.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.690
Right.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.217
Okay.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.878
Is that it?

28:25.921 --> 28:27.009
Fuck!

28:40.936 --> 28:41.807
Wow.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.158
Wow.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.294
Alright.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.199
[banging]

29:30.116 --> 29:31.813
[bus horn honks]

29:38.559 --> 29:40.561
[Italian music playing]

29:43.520 --> 29:45.522
[Matteo]
Here she comes again.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.264
- Different color
head band today?
- Yes.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.617
Good morning.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.793
[Ferruccio] Morning.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.667
Oh, she's beautiful.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.322
She smiled at you.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.628
She said good morning to you.

30:04.672 --> 30:05.804
Go say hello.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.067
Why should I?

30:08.110 --> 30:09.546
Because you like her?

30:11.984 --> 30:14.987
Maybe she doesn't like me.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.772
You'll never know
if you don't talk to her.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.382
It's not that hard.
You...

30:19.426 --> 30:24.170
You go over, you let your
mouth move and it says, "Hello."

30:25.606 --> 30:26.694
Okay.

30:26.737 --> 30:27.913
Ferruccio!

30:27.956 --> 30:29.044
Where are you going?!

30:31.394 --> 30:33.832
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.095
- Ferruccio.
- Annita. Nice to meet you.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.708
Okay. [laughing]

30:46.670 --> 30:49.978
Annita, say hello
to my friend, Matteo.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.502
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.814
What he meant to say is,
"Why don't you sit down
and join us?"

30:59.858 --> 31:02.599
Oh, I can't,
I will be late for school.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.429
What-what do you study?

31:06.473 --> 31:08.127
- Economics.
- Oh.

31:11.739 --> 31:16.222
And Matteo's the greatest
race car driver
that the world has ever known.

31:18.485 --> 31:21.009
He knows more about engines
than anyone else.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.968
- Really?
- No.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.798
Thanks for the pastry.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.369
[exhales]

31:35.719 --> 31:37.156
She likes you.

31:37.199 --> 31:40.072
Because I talked to her.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.944
If you are as good with tractors
as you are with women,

31:42.988 --> 31:44.598
oh, we are going to be
very rich.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.905
I only need one woman.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.255
Yeah. Me too.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.127
Don't give up.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.390
We only lose when we give up.
Alright?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.349
Alright, alright.

32:10.232 --> 32:12.974
[both laughing]

32:13.018 --> 32:16.847
I love you.
More than anything, I love you.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.546
I know.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.727
- Okay, hold it. Okay.
- Okay.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.822
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.389
- Okay?
- Yes.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.010
Wave, stupid.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.886
Okay.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.543
Look. Look here. Look.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.415
- [laughing]
- [Clelia] Really?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.505
[Ferruccio] Stop, stop, stop.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.768
- Yes, yes.
- No, no, no.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.075
No, no, no! [yelping]

33:10.118 --> 33:11.859
- [laughing]
- My God--

[grunts]

33:31.096 --> 33:32.401
Okay.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.113
He's close, isn't he?

33:49.070 --> 33:51.377
[Clelia] Yes. Tomorrow.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.164
Don't come home late.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.733
Okay?

33:59.776 --> 34:02.040
Promise me.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.389
I promise.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.654
[spray can hissing]

35:53.760 --> 35:55.892
[people chattering]

36:09.558 --> 36:12.953
She was bleeding,
I called the hospital.
They took her.

- [grunts]

- Okay.
- The baby's coming.

36:27.315 --> 36:28.577
- He's coming.
- Again.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.623
[nurse] It's coming.
It's coming. Breathe.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.233
- Push, Clelia.
- [Clelia grunts]

36:32.277 --> 36:35.193
Good. Breathe and push.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.501
- Push.
- [grunts]

36:41.808 --> 36:43.897
She's getting the paper!
She's bleeding!

37:05.571 --> 37:07.050
Can I help you?

37:07.703 --> 37:09.096
My wife is here!

37:13.840 --> 37:15.624
[baby crying]

37:31.074 --> 37:33.120
How is Clelia?

37:33.163 --> 37:36.079
The baby is fine.
It's a beautiful boy.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.559
Where is my wife?

37:39.082 --> 37:40.432
There was a problem.

37:51.486 --> 37:53.445
We weren't able
to stop the bleeding.

39:44.033 --> 39:47.602
We need to set a date
for the baby, for the baptism.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.256
Yes.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.301
You need to think about
other things now.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.435
[Ferruccio] Of course.

39:56.350 --> 39:59.527
May the seeds of the fruit
be planted with goodwill.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.877
And the harvest will be rich.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.715
- [Vito] Ferruccio.
- Vito.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.458
So sorry about your wife.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.852
I have a proposition for you.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.944
If I built a tractor
half that size

40:24.987 --> 40:27.816
but twice as strong,
and half the cost to operate,

40:27.860 --> 40:30.776
would your bank invest
in a thousand of them?

40:34.867 --> 40:36.564
Have you built such a tractor?

41:07.769 --> 41:09.075
[chuckles]

[laughing]

41:14.341 --> 41:16.604

41:24.699 --> 41:27.746
To the future
of the Lamborghini tractor.

41:27.789 --> 41:30.052
- We did it.
- We did it.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.140
[glasses clink]

41:37.277 --> 41:39.018
She should be here with us.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.283
- To Clelia.
- To Clelia.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.593
Look who's here.

41:54.860 --> 41:58.472
I'm crazy about her, Ferruccio.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.344
I see her face
when I close my eyes to sleep,

42:01.388 --> 42:03.564
and it's there
when I open them to wake.

42:04.391 --> 42:05.914
You're in love.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.655
[soft chuckle] I'm in love.

42:07.699 --> 42:12.094
Go get her.
Tomorrow it may be too late.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.407
I have to go.

42:21.234 --> 42:24.106
Go? Where are you going?

42:24.150 --> 42:25.281
I'm sorry.

42:27.632 --> 42:30.156
- Talk to her.
- Yeah.

42:40.383 --> 42:41.384
[door opens]

42:41.428 --> 42:42.995
[crickets chirping]

43:02.841 --> 43:04.625
Did my friend talk to you?

43:04.669 --> 43:05.713
He did.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.498
He doesn't catch my eye.

43:09.630 --> 43:10.762
You do.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.851
But you know that.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.244
Give him a chance.

43:15.288 --> 43:16.985
Why should I do that?

43:18.378 --> 43:20.293
Because he deserves one.

43:20.336 --> 43:21.860
So do I.

43:27.822 --> 43:29.215
My wife died.

43:30.172 --> 43:33.436
I know. What was her name?

43:34.350 --> 43:35.613
Clelia.

43:36.831 --> 43:37.919
She was beautiful.

43:37.963 --> 43:39.834
She was everything.

43:42.445 --> 43:43.925
Don't sit.

43:43.969 --> 43:47.146
If you do, I will let you.

43:47.189 --> 43:49.670
Here's what will happen:

43:49.714 --> 43:53.152
I'll only take
what you have to give me
because I need it.

43:55.197 --> 43:57.417
And some day
you will hate me for it.

43:58.897 --> 43:59.811
No.

44:02.770 --> 44:05.773
I won't. Never.

44:09.211 --> 44:10.517
[door opens]

44:40.329 --> 44:42.114
You just want more.

44:43.202 --> 44:45.595
You always want more.

44:45.639 --> 44:47.423
You want me to say I'm sorry?

44:47.467 --> 44:49.599
I'm sorry.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.950
Where is your shame, Ferruccio?

44:55.780 --> 44:57.607
I wanted to say it's Clelia,

44:57.651 --> 44:59.479
that her death has changed you,

44:59.522 --> 45:02.177
but in my heart
I know that is not true.

45:02.221 --> 45:04.919
This is who you are.
Who you've always been.

45:04.963 --> 45:06.747
Tonino needs a mother.

45:06.791 --> 45:08.662
So, yes,
I took her because I could.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.099
Think about what I just said
Matteo, because I could.

45:11.143 --> 45:13.362
If I didn't take her,
someone else would have.

45:13.406 --> 45:16.626
I'm sorry, but she was never
going to be yours.

45:16.670 --> 45:20.065
How can I hurt my friend
by taking something
that he never had?

45:21.370 --> 45:22.415
[chuckles]

45:24.286 --> 45:25.984
Don't let this change things,
Matteo.

45:29.422 --> 45:30.423
I need you.

45:31.554 --> 45:33.556
I've always needed you.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.428
Clelia knew that.

45:35.471 --> 45:37.473
Clelia was the smart one.

45:39.301 --> 45:42.217
She said nothing good
could come of this,

45:43.044 --> 45:44.524
and look what happened.

45:50.008 --> 45:52.880
I want 25 percent
of the company.

45:54.664 --> 45:56.231
The rest is yours.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.864
[jazzy music playing]

46:30.744 --> 46:32.093
Tre mignon.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.275
Due cornetti.

46:42.364 --> 46:45.324
One Sacher torte,
in its own box.

46:47.587 --> 46:49.067
Thank you.

46:49.110 --> 46:52.548
[jazzy music continues]

47:03.124 --> 47:04.038
Ciao Bella.

47:17.573 --> 47:20.054
- Is Annita in the office?
- She is.

47:21.490 --> 47:23.101
- Red or blue?
- Red.

47:23.144 --> 47:27.322
- Not blue?
- Definitely red.
Definitely red.

47:27.366 --> 47:29.020
Who screwed up?

47:29.063 --> 47:31.152
It wasn't us.

47:31.196 --> 47:32.893
[Annita] Ferruccio!

47:37.028 --> 47:38.464
Go see what she wants.

47:38.507 --> 47:39.639
Not me.

47:39.682 --> 47:40.901
You're a coward.

47:40.945 --> 47:41.859
[muttering]

47:41.902 --> 47:43.425
[speaking Italian]

47:50.563 --> 47:52.260
You look beautiful this morning.

47:52.304 --> 47:54.393
I'm sorry I had to leave early.

47:54.436 --> 47:56.917
Did I mention you
look beautiful this morning?

47:58.614 --> 47:59.920
[chuckles]

47:59.964 --> 48:03.489
Every time you buy pastries
it costs us money.

48:03.532 --> 48:05.012
Well, take it from my salary.

48:05.056 --> 48:07.406
You forget, I own the company.

48:07.449 --> 48:08.624
Is that so?

48:09.712 --> 48:12.063
Mrs. Giambini called.

48:12.106 --> 48:14.456
Who's-who's Giambini?

48:14.500 --> 48:15.893
She isn't happy
with her tractor?

48:15.936 --> 48:18.808
[chuckles]
No, she is unhappy with Tonino.

48:18.852 --> 48:20.985
She's his teacher.

48:21.028 --> 48:23.378
Tesoro, you have to spend
more time with him.

48:23.422 --> 48:24.771
I give him everything.

48:24.814 --> 48:27.513
Yes, you give him money,
clothes, cars.

48:27.556 --> 48:29.558
But of yourself?

48:29.602 --> 48:32.431
That's what he really wants.

48:32.474 --> 48:35.434
You know he is as smart
as you are, but he's failing.

48:35.477 --> 48:37.697
I'll talk to him.

48:37.740 --> 48:40.526
My friend Diego
has a new exhibit.

48:40.569 --> 48:43.398
- I hate your friend Diego.
- [chuckles]

48:43.442 --> 48:45.487
We should go, bring Tonino.

48:45.531 --> 48:47.925
Spend some time together
as a family.

48:56.759 --> 48:57.891
[groans]

48:57.935 --> 49:00.241
Goddamn clutch!

49:00.285 --> 49:03.331
[groans]
Tonino, it never works.

49:08.075 --> 49:09.424
What do you think?

49:09.468 --> 49:10.773
About what?

49:11.774 --> 49:12.645
The boat.

49:12.688 --> 49:14.864
It's a present for you.

49:14.908 --> 49:17.041
Because I failed
all my subjects?

49:18.172 --> 49:20.087
- Yes.
- What happens next?

49:20.131 --> 49:23.134
We get in the boat,
you take me out to sea,
and throw me overboard?

49:26.050 --> 49:28.095
Come. Sit.

49:29.749 --> 49:30.619
Sit.

49:37.061 --> 49:39.454
Tonino, life is short.

49:39.498 --> 49:42.980
When one is young,
when one is beautiful,
like yourself,

49:44.329 --> 49:45.983
there are more important
things than grades.

49:47.375 --> 49:48.507
Like my mother?

49:50.900 --> 49:52.337
Like her.

49:52.380 --> 49:54.556
You still miss her, don't you?

49:56.080 --> 49:57.211
Yes.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.823
Why?

50:00.867 --> 50:03.174
Because she was beautiful,
like you.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.741
Is that why you
miss her so much?

50:15.708 --> 50:17.971
I miss her so much
because she was the kindest

50:18.015 --> 50:21.105
and the smartest person
I ever met.

50:22.628 --> 50:24.021
She understood
better than anyone

50:24.064 --> 50:27.067
the difference between
right and wrong.

50:27.111 --> 50:29.243
And for a lot of people
that's not so easy.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.159
She always did the right thing.

50:33.421 --> 50:35.119
She made it look easy.

50:38.078 --> 50:40.472
Annita's pretty great, too.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.171
She is.

50:49.133 --> 50:51.439
If your grades don't improve,
I'll buy you a Ferrari.

50:52.875 --> 50:55.313
[upbeat music playing]

51:09.240 --> 51:10.676
Good day, mate.

51:10.719 --> 51:12.199
I'm looking for a job.

51:12.243 --> 51:14.027
Any inkling
on who I might see?

51:14.071 --> 51:18.249
Everyone's gone home.
Come back tomorrow.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.903
That's a pretty flash motor
you're working on there!

51:20.947 --> 51:23.558
- Australian?
- Nah, Kiwi.

51:23.602 --> 51:27.084
- What do you do?
- Anything needed for a car.

51:27.127 --> 51:31.000
I came here to turn a wrench.
I love the Italian motors, mate.

51:31.044 --> 51:33.177
Yeah, called in on Maserati,
Fiat, Ferrari,

51:33.220 --> 51:35.048
they all told me to piss off.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.310
What are we working on?

51:37.616 --> 51:38.791
Bad clutch.

51:48.627 --> 51:51.847
Whoever's been driving that car
needs a lesson or three.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.850
It's not the driver.
It's the clutch.

51:54.894 --> 51:56.896
Would that be
a matter of opinion?

51:59.681 --> 52:01.422
I want to modify
the tractor clutch,

52:01.466 --> 52:03.381
to use in the Ferrari.

52:03.424 --> 52:07.385
In your opinion,
what do I have to do?

52:07.428 --> 52:10.214
The disc and the plates
are pretty much the same.

52:11.519 --> 52:14.174
More than enough space
to mount it.

52:14.218 --> 52:15.915
I'd say you don't have to do
a bloody thing,

52:15.958 --> 52:17.308
you just put
the new clutch in.

52:17.351 --> 52:20.789
- I agree.
- I'll give a hand.

52:21.616 --> 52:22.878
What's your name?

52:22.922 --> 52:25.620
Wallace.
Bob Wallace. Yours?

52:25.664 --> 52:28.493
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

52:31.931 --> 52:33.976
You have a-a car?

52:34.020 --> 52:35.108
Yeah.

52:35.891 --> 52:36.936
You a good driver?

52:36.979 --> 52:38.067
Yeah, I'm the best
in New Zealand.

52:38.111 --> 52:40.287
Oh. What about Italy?

52:40.331 --> 52:42.376
If that was a job offer,
I'll take it.

52:42.420 --> 52:43.725
[chuckles]

52:46.554 --> 52:47.642
Come.

52:56.129 --> 53:00.133
I think everything
that they said is good to do.
It's good.

53:00.177 --> 53:03.658
Can you tell him?
Give him my very best.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.225
[Ferruccio]
Signor Ferrari.

53:05.269 --> 53:08.794
Just a moment.
Good night.

53:08.837 --> 53:11.144
Forgive me,
if I could have a moment.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.233
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
How do you do, sir?

53:14.191 --> 53:15.453
What can I do for you?

53:15.496 --> 53:17.411
If I may, in my opinion,

53:17.455 --> 53:19.239
- you make the best cars
in the world.
- Oh.

53:19.283 --> 53:23.025
I have seven of them.
One for every day of the week.

53:23.069 --> 53:25.245
Well, there should be
more days in the week.

53:25.289 --> 53:27.856
More buyers like yourself.
Nice to meet you.

53:27.900 --> 53:32.252
I have a 250 GT Coupé,
a Pininfarina.

53:32.296 --> 53:34.123
I have a 250 GT Bayoneta.

53:34.167 --> 53:36.474
- It's a great car.
I like it very much.
- Mm-hm.

53:36.517 --> 53:40.260
I even bought a 250GT 2+2.
All great.

53:40.304 --> 53:44.351
But with all my Ferraris,
there is a problem.

53:44.395 --> 53:47.224
The clutch.
They're all bad.

53:50.879 --> 53:54.143
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
You know who I am?

53:54.666 --> 53:55.667
Oh, yes.

53:55.710 --> 53:57.582
You make tractors.

53:57.625 --> 53:59.366
And air conditioning
and heating.

53:59.410 --> 54:02.935
Ah.
I've got a dinner appointment.

54:02.978 --> 54:06.417
Forgive me, but your clutch
does not live up to your car.

54:07.983 --> 54:09.811
I come as a friend.

54:09.855 --> 54:12.901
I'm sure you know this,
I'm not the first
to point it out.

54:14.294 --> 54:15.730
I have a solution.

54:15.774 --> 54:17.471
If you'd consider a partnership.

54:18.342 --> 54:21.649
Ferrari and Lamborghini.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.782
We'll make the best cars
in the world.

54:25.523 --> 54:27.786
Go back to your tractors,
farmer.

54:34.096 --> 54:36.447
You're stealing from people.

54:36.490 --> 54:38.623
You're charging ten times
what it costs me

54:38.666 --> 54:40.451
to put a better clutch
in my tractors.

54:40.494 --> 54:42.540
You know what they say
about Lamborghini?

54:43.932 --> 54:46.631
That he's too uneducated
to understand

54:46.674 --> 54:47.893
what he doesn't know.

54:58.686 --> 55:01.820
So, not to state the obvious,
but he's a prick
of the first order.

55:01.863 --> 55:03.125
Isn't he?

55:03.169 --> 55:04.692
I don't like the way
the man talks,

55:04.736 --> 55:05.954
don't like the way he dresses,

55:05.998 --> 55:09.567
don't like his smile,
or lack thereof.

55:09.610 --> 55:11.308
You already have the job.

55:12.787 --> 55:14.920
It doesn't change the truth
of what is.

55:25.017 --> 55:27.106
[engine revving]

55:51.217 --> 55:54.176
[man] The Miura is the fiercest
and most cunning of all bulls.

55:54.220 --> 55:56.614
But this matador
is the champion.

55:57.919 --> 55:59.486
Life and death, Tonino.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.619
This is what bullfighting
is all about.

56:07.407 --> 56:11.759
Some people turn away,
others watch and learn.

56:11.803 --> 56:14.196
I want the bull to win.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.242
Me too.
But it doesn't happen often.

56:18.766 --> 56:22.466
Tonino, look at the faces
of the people.

56:22.509 --> 56:25.991
The matador kills the beast,
or the beast kills the matador.

56:26.034 --> 56:29.211
That moment will live forever
in the hearts of the people
watching.

56:29.255 --> 56:31.388
Why doesn't he run away?

56:31.431 --> 56:33.912
Because he is a champion.

56:37.785 --> 56:39.352
It's fascinating, isn't it?

56:39.396 --> 56:43.487
The bull is everything.
So unforgettable.

56:44.836 --> 56:46.272
[Annita] What are you thinking?

56:47.795 --> 56:49.318
I'm thinking of a car.

56:51.103 --> 56:52.844
A car that doesn't exist yet.

56:52.887 --> 56:54.236
One that is as
strong and powerful

56:54.280 --> 56:56.151
and as unforgettable
as the bull.

56:59.328 --> 57:00.982
I'm going to build it.

57:02.070 --> 57:03.420
A car?

57:11.384 --> 57:12.994
[woman]
Coffee, gentlemen?

57:13.038 --> 57:15.083
[man] Hi. Yes, please.

57:17.782 --> 57:19.697
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

57:24.702 --> 57:26.660
I come get you later.

57:27.792 --> 57:30.795
Perfect. Have a good day.

57:33.928 --> 57:38.672
So, this is my idea.
How long will it take?

57:38.716 --> 57:41.283
How long? It can't be done.

57:43.851 --> 57:46.332
How long do you
think it will take?

57:46.375 --> 57:49.161
As much as I hate to agree
with Mr. Bizzarrini,
I think he's right.

57:51.859 --> 57:53.687
This? This can't be done.

57:54.688 --> 57:55.863
You agree?

57:57.082 --> 57:58.953
I actually love
what you're asking.

57:58.997 --> 58:01.260
It's new and I'll design it.

58:03.349 --> 58:05.090
But engineering
is their department,

58:05.133 --> 58:07.309
if they think it's impossible,
who am I to argue?

58:07.353 --> 58:09.529
What I can say,
I can't design a car

58:09.573 --> 58:11.313
if I don't know
the specifications,

58:11.357 --> 58:12.793
and it's something
that needs to be decided.

58:12.837 --> 58:15.492
It is decided. It's right here.

58:15.535 --> 58:18.451
This is the car to make
the world forget about Ferrari.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.974
Ferruccio, please.

58:20.018 --> 58:22.803
A V12 touring car
double camshaft,

58:22.847 --> 58:25.806
dry sump lubrication,
five speed transmission.

58:25.850 --> 58:29.201
A limited slip differential,
two ignition coils
instead of one?

58:29.244 --> 58:31.246
Six twin-choke carburetors.

58:31.290 --> 58:34.728
It's impossible to fit all
of this in a 3.5 liter engine.

58:34.772 --> 58:37.383
No, it must be a 3.5,
four liter is too heavy.

58:37.426 --> 58:40.517
We need the power
but we need the speed, too.

58:40.560 --> 58:43.781
The Lamborghini 350 GT has to be
as fast as a racing car.

58:43.824 --> 58:46.305
The man wants to defy
the laws of physics.

58:46.348 --> 58:48.525
Are you listening?
Either you're a carmaker

58:48.568 --> 58:49.961
or you are a dreamer, Ferruccio.

58:50.004 --> 58:52.311
Please, we all have
families here.

58:52.354 --> 58:54.835
We all quit our job
to come work for you.

58:54.879 --> 58:57.098
We all believe in you,
we all believe in your ideas
but--

58:57.142 --> 59:00.624
What if instead of cast-iron
we make an aluminum engine?

59:00.667 --> 59:02.321
I know you are
the new genius in town,

59:02.364 --> 59:05.367
but people have been
trying this for years.

59:05.411 --> 59:07.021
Aluminum can't
withstand the heat.

59:07.065 --> 59:10.068
What if we keep
certain parts cast-iron?

59:10.111 --> 59:13.375
The valves, the cylinders,
the combustion chamber.

59:13.419 --> 59:16.117
That's something new,
I don't know
if this would work.

59:16.161 --> 59:17.597
But we can try it.

59:17.641 --> 59:19.599
It could be as much as
half the weight of the engine.

59:19.643 --> 59:21.470
- At least.
- And the engine,

59:21.514 --> 59:23.908
maybe we can change it
from dry sump to wet sump.

59:23.951 --> 59:26.824
I need to build a chassis
to accommodate
a double camshaft.

59:26.867 --> 59:28.913
- Good.
- And the carburetors?

59:28.956 --> 59:30.610
A rear stabilizer bow
would help.

59:30.654 --> 59:33.134
Great. Great.
And it has to be ready to unveil

59:33.178 --> 59:36.224
- in the Geneva Motor Show.
- That's very tight.

59:36.268 --> 59:38.400
- I think we can do it.
- It's 18 months.

59:38.444 --> 59:41.795
No, no. Six months.
Geneva is March 21st.

59:41.839 --> 59:44.102
- Geneva this year?
- Yes.

59:44.145 --> 59:47.018
- You want to do Geneva
in six months?
- Oh, yes.

59:47.061 --> 59:49.411
Ferruccio, please,
you're talking like a madman,
seriously.

59:49.455 --> 59:52.110
Why would you ask me
to design an automobile
in six months

59:52.153 --> 59:53.938
that doesn't yet have
an engine or a chassis?

59:53.981 --> 59:55.417
In six months, in Geneva,

59:55.461 --> 59:58.029
people will be looking for
the next Ferrari.

59:58.072 --> 1:00:00.248
What they will find
is the first Lamborghini.

1:00:00.292 --> 1:00:02.903
The Lamborghini 350 GT.

1:00:07.342 --> 1:00:08.430
Why are we here?

1:00:09.431 --> 1:00:10.824
Someone tell me why we're here.

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:13.610
- To make a car.
- To make the best car!

1:00:13.653 --> 1:00:15.916
To make the greatest car
the world has ever seen.

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:18.571
As strong as Hercules,
as beautiful as Sofia Loren.

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.747
It must be ready for Geneva!

1:00:20.791 --> 1:00:23.707
It's not impossible
until we fail.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:27.014
If we fail, we fail
searching for greatness.

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:31.497
Huh?

1:00:31.540 --> 1:00:34.021
We need to get Bevini
and Pedrazzi for fabrication
and assembly.

1:00:34.065 --> 1:00:36.023
They are brilliant and fast,
and everybody wants them.

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:37.634
No, we'll get it.

1:00:37.677 --> 1:00:39.679
We'll have no time to make
our own differential or brakes.

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:41.681
- We'll have to buy those.
- Germany for differentials.

1:00:41.725 --> 1:00:44.597
- [Dallara] Zahnradfabrik.
- [Bizzarini]
England for brakes. Girling.

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.555
Girling will never deliver
in time for Geneva.

1:00:46.599 --> 1:00:47.731
Leave it to me.

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.125
Okay? Good?

1:00:52.344 --> 1:00:54.476
We chase the dream? Okay?

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:57.305
- You're all crazy,
you know that.
- Yes! Isn't it wonderful!

1:00:57.349 --> 1:00:58.567
- [laughing]
- Come on.

1:00:58.611 --> 1:00:59.960
- Cheers.
- [Ferruccio] Yes!

1:01:00.004 --> 1:01:03.834
No, no, no, no. Not two weeks!
One week.

1:01:03.877 --> 1:01:06.358
- I need the differential
in one week.
- Grazie.

1:01:06.401 --> 1:01:09.187
[yelling in German]

1:01:09.230 --> 1:01:10.536
[phone receiver slams]

1:01:12.364 --> 1:01:13.974
Nobody wants to do anything.

1:01:14.018 --> 1:01:17.586
Now I have to go Germany
and then England after that.

1:01:19.327 --> 1:01:22.200
I don't think it's wise
what you're doing, Ferruccio.

1:01:22.243 --> 1:01:24.419
You're going to suck
every penny out of the tractors,

1:01:24.463 --> 1:01:26.465
and if it doesn't work,
we will lose everything.

1:01:26.508 --> 1:01:28.554
Please. It will work.

1:01:28.597 --> 1:01:32.253
But what if it doesn't?
Look at what happened to Lancia.

1:01:32.297 --> 1:01:35.517
The unions will beat them,
and Lancia will go under.

1:01:35.561 --> 1:01:38.651
I take good care of my men,
they have no need to strike.

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:41.088
The price of petrol
keeps going up,

1:01:41.132 --> 1:01:44.265
and there's talk
of nationalizing
the energy industry.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:46.920
People will always
need to buy tractors.

1:01:46.964 --> 1:01:50.402
But luxury cars?
That is the first thing
they'll stop buying.

1:01:52.099 --> 1:01:55.146
Alright, well, then what about
the board of directors?

1:01:55.189 --> 1:01:58.279
You at least
have a responsibility
to tell them what you're doing.

1:01:59.367 --> 1:02:01.195
I talked to them.

1:02:01.239 --> 1:02:03.502
You went to the board?

1:02:03.545 --> 1:02:05.678
I knew you would object.

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.941
No, you know that I am right.

1:02:07.985 --> 1:02:11.423
But you don't care about me,
you don't care about the board,

1:02:11.466 --> 1:02:14.469
you don't care about your men,
you don't even care
about your own son.

1:02:14.513 --> 1:02:17.037
The only thing that matters
is the great Lamborghini!

1:02:17.081 --> 1:02:18.560
What do you want me to do?!

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:24.262
You want me to be normal?

1:02:24.305 --> 1:02:26.568
You want me to be
like everyone else?

1:02:26.612 --> 1:02:29.441
Living on my knees, afraid to
make the wrong decision?

1:02:29.484 --> 1:02:32.183
Making a fool of myself
at every turn?

1:02:32.226 --> 1:02:35.447
Crawling like a crab
on the floor of the ocean?

1:02:35.490 --> 1:02:37.928
I don't know who you
thought you married!

1:02:37.971 --> 1:02:41.453
I married someone
who could talk! Not only yell.

1:02:41.496 --> 1:02:43.934
For that I have bread,
and I have a lot.

1:02:49.026 --> 1:02:52.899
You have already gotten yourself
off of the ocean floor.

1:02:52.943 --> 1:02:55.206
What you're doing
could put you back there.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:59.776
You are the only one
who doesn't understand, Annita.

1:02:59.819 --> 1:03:02.604
Everyone loves me.
You are the only one.

1:03:03.605 --> 1:03:04.955
Everyone else thinks I'm great.

1:03:04.998 --> 1:03:07.261
Who are all these people

1:03:07.305 --> 1:03:08.872
who think you're so great,
Ferruccio?

1:03:08.915 --> 1:03:13.224
My workers. Huh?
My friends.

1:03:13.267 --> 1:03:15.313
They love you
because you pay them.

1:03:15.356 --> 1:03:17.968
Once they want
what you cannot pay

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:21.101
they will strike
and you will be alone.

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:32.504
What is this?

1:03:32.547 --> 1:03:36.377
CVs for your new secretary.

1:03:36.421 --> 1:03:38.510
I fired the blonde
you're fucking.

1:03:54.874 --> 1:03:56.963
[dramatic music playing]

1:04:00.358 --> 1:04:02.055
Good. Coming left. Left.

1:04:02.099 --> 1:04:03.709
- It's left.
- Your left.

1:04:03.752 --> 1:04:04.623
My left.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:06.494
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:04:08.627 --> 1:04:11.412
[Scaglione] I think
it's everything we talked about.

1:04:11.456 --> 1:04:12.892
It's a little extreme.

1:04:12.936 --> 1:04:14.372
I like it.

1:04:14.415 --> 1:04:16.026
It's what you asked for.

1:04:17.592 --> 1:04:18.550
What is this?

1:04:18.593 --> 1:04:20.117
The headlights.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.206
They pop up
when you turn on car?

1:04:22.249 --> 1:04:23.511
- Yes.
- Pop up?

1:04:23.555 --> 1:04:25.078
No, no, no, Franco.

1:04:25.122 --> 1:04:27.515
No, no, no. It's too complex.

1:04:27.559 --> 1:04:30.170
We need to make a statement,
not a question.

1:04:30.214 --> 1:04:33.130
The idea is
when you look at it,
there are no headlights,

1:04:33.173 --> 1:04:36.916
then when you turn the key,
the lids rise
and the lights come up.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:39.484
It's innovative.
Ferruccio, this is new.

1:04:39.527 --> 1:04:43.183
It's exciting. And you wanted it
to look like a race car.

1:04:43.227 --> 1:04:45.707
Yes, a race car,
fast and powerful,

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:47.405
but still a touring car,
gran turismo.

1:04:47.448 --> 1:04:51.148
And look here,
this-this bonnet is too big.

1:04:52.192 --> 1:04:55.979
Bonnet is perfect. Perfect.

1:04:56.022 --> 1:04:58.895
Franco, it looks like
a marshmallow
on top of a flounder.

1:05:03.812 --> 1:05:06.250
Franco. Franco.

1:05:21.656 --> 1:05:24.268
[indistinct chatter]

1:05:27.575 --> 1:05:29.447
I'm sorry
I'm not good enough for you.

1:05:29.490 --> 1:05:32.450
[scoffs]
Franco, I love you.

1:05:32.493 --> 1:05:34.408
I hate your design,
but I love you.

1:05:35.844 --> 1:05:38.021
All I'm asking is
that you start over.

1:05:39.544 --> 1:05:41.807
You ask us
to be creative, Ferruccio.

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:45.506
And this is creative.
And you want me to start over.

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:49.728
You can't ask me the world
and when I give it to you,

1:05:49.771 --> 1:05:51.730
you tell me
you want a different one.

1:05:51.773 --> 1:05:54.559
I've given you greatness,
Ferruccio. Greatness.

1:05:54.602 --> 1:05:57.562
You've given me a look
at something I don't understand.

1:05:57.605 --> 1:06:01.087
Give me something I understand.
It's all I want.

1:06:02.697 --> 1:06:05.744
The world will be ready
for this one day, just not now.

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:12.403
The bonnet is too big,
the grill too extreme.

1:06:12.446 --> 1:06:14.709
I like the headlights,
I love them!

1:06:14.753 --> 1:06:18.322
But not for the prototype.
Next year we do that.

1:06:18.365 --> 1:06:20.802
The back is too sharp,
it's too sharp.

1:06:20.846 --> 1:06:24.154
Less contour, more round.

1:06:24.197 --> 1:06:27.113
Franco. Franco, look at me.

1:06:28.071 --> 1:06:29.898
You are a great designer.

1:06:29.942 --> 1:06:31.204
Maybe the greatest.

1:06:32.597 --> 1:06:34.642
Give me something great.

1:06:39.212 --> 1:06:41.432
I don't have any more to give,
Ferruccio.

1:06:44.522 --> 1:06:46.393
Ferruccio.

1:06:48.308 --> 1:06:49.527
Everything good?

1:06:50.876 --> 1:06:53.139
Nothing is good.

1:06:53.183 --> 1:06:55.750
[Dallara]
The good news is the innovations
are going to work;

1:06:55.794 --> 1:06:58.492
the front and rear suspension's
on independent wheels,

1:06:58.536 --> 1:07:00.712
with double wishbones
and stabilizer bars.

1:07:00.755 --> 1:07:02.496
We'll have the speed
and the power.

1:07:05.543 --> 1:07:07.371
Carburetors are too high.

1:07:07.414 --> 1:07:10.591
Exactly. We won't be able
to close the hood.

1:07:10.635 --> 1:07:12.593
Obviously, the measurements
were off.

1:07:12.637 --> 1:07:14.943
I take responsibility for it,
Ferruccio.

1:07:14.987 --> 1:07:18.077
But we are working too fast,
there's no time
to check anything.

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:21.385
I take responsibility, not you.

1:07:21.428 --> 1:07:24.083
So, what do we do?

1:07:24.127 --> 1:07:25.867
If you want to keep
the twin-choke carburetors,

1:07:25.911 --> 1:07:27.652
we need to create a new design.

1:07:27.695 --> 1:07:30.133
There's no room to lower them
or make them smaller.

1:07:30.176 --> 1:07:32.309
What if we make them horizontal?

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:34.528
I thought of that.
There's no room.

1:07:34.572 --> 1:07:36.182
Then we make room.

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:42.275
It's possible, but these things
take time, Ferruccio.

1:07:42.319 --> 1:07:45.757
I can talk to Franco,
maybe he can raise the hood,
that's an easier fix.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:50.153
What are we going to make
a hump like a camel?
No, don't think so.

1:07:50.196 --> 1:07:53.373
We can't redesign,
we'd have to make a new engine,
we'd never make Geneva.

1:07:53.417 --> 1:07:57.551
Excuse me, Ferruccio,
but wouldn't it be better
to miss it

1:07:57.595 --> 1:08:00.554
than present a car
that doesn't deliver on
everything we want it to be?

1:08:06.038 --> 1:08:11.130
Make the carburetors horizontal.
You'll find a way.

1:08:11.174 --> 1:08:14.177
[Italian music playing]

1:08:22.707 --> 1:08:23.969
[door closes]

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.977
I got a proposition
for you, mate.

1:08:34.719 --> 1:08:37.548
I'd like to be your test driver
for this new car of ours.

1:08:37.591 --> 1:08:40.377
- I need a great one.
- You're looking at him.

1:08:42.770 --> 1:08:44.555
Are all Australians like you?

1:08:44.598 --> 1:08:48.559
No, Australians would love
to be like me, a kiwi.

1:08:50.735 --> 1:08:52.084
[chuckles]

1:08:54.434 --> 1:08:57.742
Actually, all kiwis
would love to be like me, too.

1:08:57.785 --> 1:09:00.832
But, nah. I'm a one-off.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:08.013
Ah, she's a beaut, mate.

1:09:11.669 --> 1:09:13.236
[man] This is what you gave me.

1:09:17.283 --> 1:09:19.067
I think we're pretty close.

1:09:33.212 --> 1:09:35.954
I thought the gold
might be wrong at first, but...

1:09:35.997 --> 1:09:38.304
I'm eternally grateful, maestro.

1:09:43.875 --> 1:09:46.791
[Ferruccio] It's going to be
the greatest car
that's ever been made.

1:09:46.834 --> 1:09:50.708
The Lamborghini 350 GT.
We unveil in Geneva.

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:56.975
Oh, interview?
That's fantastic, tomorrow.

1:09:57.018 --> 1:10:00.108
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

1:10:00.152 --> 1:10:02.154
No, no, no, no.
Tomorrow works.

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:07.028
That's great.
Fantastic. Ciao.

1:10:09.770 --> 1:10:10.989
[sighs]

1:10:11.032 --> 1:10:12.904
[interviewer]
Car enthusiasts all over America

1:10:12.947 --> 1:10:14.949
are hearing rumors
that after dominating

1:10:14.993 --> 1:10:17.125
in the field of tractors,
air conditioning and heating,

1:10:17.169 --> 1:10:20.564
Lamborghini is gonna be
the big news of the upcoming
automotive season.

1:10:20.607 --> 1:10:22.522
This March,
at the Geneva Motor Show,

1:10:22.566 --> 1:10:25.917
I will unveil the first
Lamborghini Gran Turismo
automobile.

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:27.875
Ah, very exciting, of course.

1:10:27.919 --> 1:10:29.442
But, tell me why you think
that the world

1:10:29.486 --> 1:10:30.661
needs another luxury car.

1:10:30.704 --> 1:10:33.098
We have the Ferraris,
we have the Maseratis,

1:10:33.141 --> 1:10:35.492
that's nothing to say
of our friends
in England and Germany.

1:10:35.535 --> 1:10:40.279
Yes, yes, good cars all.
Many of which I own and drive.

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:42.281
But it's perfection
that I am after.

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:46.198
And as great as these cars are,
I'm not convinced
they are special.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:49.549
Special is drinking
your favorite wine
for the first time.

1:10:49.593 --> 1:10:53.945
Special is...
losing your virginity.

1:10:53.988 --> 1:10:57.122
Special is that one thing
you never forget.

1:10:57.165 --> 1:11:00.517
This is what we bring to Geneva.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:04.347
[Scaglione] Here, here and here.

1:11:10.788 --> 1:11:12.050
Great?

1:11:14.139 --> 1:11:15.488
Great.

1:11:16.533 --> 1:11:17.795
[laughter]

1:11:17.838 --> 1:11:19.187
Beautiful.

1:11:19.231 --> 1:11:20.841
[man] Well done.

1:11:20.885 --> 1:11:22.365
[Ferruccio] Bravo, bravo.

1:11:22.408 --> 1:11:24.280
[dramatic music playing]

1:11:45.518 --> 1:11:47.085
[Dallara] We reconfigured
the exhaust pipes

1:11:47.128 --> 1:11:48.608
and moved them
closer to the front.

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:51.263
We widened the axles
an inch on each side.

1:11:51.307 --> 1:11:54.397
The wheels will be
15 inches instead of 16.

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:56.399
We also moved from
a standard shifter

1:11:56.442 --> 1:11:59.053
to a gated shifter
which gave us more room.

1:11:59.097 --> 1:12:02.753
- Enough?
- Theoretically.

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:05.059
Okay. Let's see if it fits.

1:12:25.036 --> 1:12:26.298
We have a car.

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.734
[chuckles]

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:35.655
When we are a success in Geneva,
they will want to know
our next idea.

1:12:35.699 --> 1:12:37.396
You start thinking
about this now.

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:38.963
Excuse me?

1:12:39.006 --> 1:12:41.792
I only have a name, the Miura.

1:12:42.706 --> 1:12:43.924
Like the bull.

1:12:43.968 --> 1:12:45.752
It must be
the most beautiful car

1:12:45.796 --> 1:12:47.363
the world has ever seen.

1:12:49.887 --> 1:12:50.801
Yeah?

1:12:52.759 --> 1:12:55.414
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:12:55.458 --> 1:13:01.681
our special guest of honor,
the one and only Tony Renis.

1:13:01.725 --> 1:13:05.468
- [cheering]
- [upbeat music playing]

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:11.430
[singing in Italian]

1:14:03.613 --> 1:14:06.267
[cheering and applause]

1:14:09.923 --> 1:14:12.491
[song ends]

1:14:12.535 --> 1:14:15.842
This one is for my great friend,
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

1:14:15.886 --> 1:14:17.583
The pride of Italy.

1:14:19.933 --> 1:14:21.544
Maestro.

1:14:21.587 --> 1:14:24.285
[slow tempo song playing]

1:14:28.638 --> 1:14:30.944
[singing in Italian]

1:14:51.225 --> 1:14:52.879
You're Lamborghini?

1:14:54.794 --> 1:14:56.100
Ferruccio.

1:14:57.144 --> 1:14:58.581
What are you drawing?

1:14:58.624 --> 1:15:00.496
An idea.

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:01.975
For a car?

1:15:02.019 --> 1:15:04.674
For the greatest car
in the world.

1:15:04.717 --> 1:15:06.371
Can I see it?

1:15:10.984 --> 1:15:11.811
Come.

1:15:19.993 --> 1:15:21.952
What do you see?

1:15:21.995 --> 1:15:25.216
Lines on a napkin.
What do you see?

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:27.958
- A dream.
- What?

1:15:28.001 --> 1:15:30.917
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

1:15:30.961 --> 1:15:32.440
Close them.

1:15:37.141 --> 1:15:38.098
Open them.

1:15:49.153 --> 1:15:51.634
Now, the headlights on my Miura

1:15:51.677 --> 1:15:55.072
will have beautiful eyelashes,
like yours.

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:58.336
[indistinct chatter]

1:16:06.953 --> 1:16:10.870
Tonino,
go wait in the car. Please.

1:16:16.441 --> 1:16:19.749
Ah, Annita,
I've been waiting for you.

1:16:19.792 --> 1:16:21.577
Let me introduce Gabriella.

1:16:21.620 --> 1:16:23.927
Please don't. Leave.

1:16:23.970 --> 1:16:26.843
- Annita, please.
- Leave, now!

1:16:26.886 --> 1:16:31.848
Annita, I'm showing her
my sketch.

1:16:31.891 --> 1:16:36.026
You said once
that you would never love me,

1:16:36.069 --> 1:16:39.159
and that I would hate you
for it in the end.

1:16:39.203 --> 1:16:40.987
But you were wrong.

1:16:41.031 --> 1:16:44.469
I don't hate you,
I feel sorry for you.

1:16:44.512 --> 1:16:47.603
You have a hole in your heart,
and I was wrong to think

1:16:47.646 --> 1:16:50.910
that I could fill it
with all the love in mine.

1:16:50.954 --> 1:16:54.392
But now I know,
you never want
to have it filled.

1:16:54.435 --> 1:16:56.916
And now, neither do I.

1:16:59.266 --> 1:17:00.877
And what about Tonino?

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:03.488
- What about him?
- He is my son.

1:17:03.531 --> 1:17:07.623
Are you asking me
to leave him with you?

1:17:07.666 --> 1:17:10.800
And leave him without
the only mother he's ever known?

1:17:10.843 --> 1:17:15.108
If that is what you're asking,
then ask.

1:17:15.152 --> 1:17:16.806
If you have it in you,
then ask.

1:17:23.334 --> 1:17:24.901
Goodbye, Ferruccio.

1:17:37.087 --> 1:17:39.480
[applause]

1:17:42.048 --> 1:17:44.572
[birds chirping]

1:17:45.878 --> 1:17:47.097
Where are they?

1:17:48.359 --> 1:17:50.100
Maybe they had an accident.

1:17:50.143 --> 1:17:52.015
Maybe you
should have an accident.

1:17:53.059 --> 1:17:54.974
[engine revving]

1:17:56.759 --> 1:17:58.848
There are so many things
we don't know.

1:17:58.891 --> 1:18:00.501
And this is a prototype
not a car.

1:18:02.199 --> 1:18:04.157
[tires screeching]

1:18:05.550 --> 1:18:07.334
I told him not to push it.

1:18:08.379 --> 1:18:10.076
We don't know anything.

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.948
Baby steps!

1:18:11.991 --> 1:18:14.385
We told him, baby steps!

1:18:15.342 --> 1:18:17.301
[tires screech]

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:19.303
[engine revs]

1:18:21.305 --> 1:18:23.524
[dramatic music playing]

1:18:42.108 --> 1:18:43.719
It's everything we want!

1:18:43.762 --> 1:18:46.504
[all cheering]

1:18:53.729 --> 1:18:55.252
[laughing]

1:18:57.863 --> 1:18:59.256
It should be green.

1:18:59.822 --> 1:19:01.737
What?

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:03.869
- Green, should be green.
- Green?

1:19:03.913 --> 1:19:06.698
But-but this or next one?

1:19:06.742 --> 1:19:08.700
This, for Geneva, green.

1:19:08.744 --> 1:19:10.049
- Hm?
- Okay.

1:19:10.093 --> 1:19:12.182
[laughing]

1:19:13.618 --> 1:19:16.055
[upbeat music playing]

1:19:27.110 --> 1:19:29.503
Italy has long been
an agricultural society,

1:19:29.547 --> 1:19:32.985
but post-war Italy
has given birth
to an industrial Renaissance.

1:19:33.029 --> 1:19:35.248
Ever wonder how one might create
something new in a world

1:19:35.292 --> 1:19:39.513
of inventive, challenging,
and innovative car manufacturers
and designers?

1:19:39.557 --> 1:19:40.993
Well, I'm standing here
with somebody

1:19:41.037 --> 1:19:42.908
who just might be able
to have those answers.

1:19:42.952 --> 1:19:45.084
None other than
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

1:19:45.128 --> 1:19:46.651
[interviewer and Ferruccio]
Ciao.

1:19:46.694 --> 1:19:47.739
[interviewer] So, how does
somebody like you demonstrate

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:49.132
a clear break from tradition

1:19:49.175 --> 1:19:50.829
and deliver something brand new?

1:19:50.873 --> 1:19:53.832
The Lamborghini GT is both
beautiful and high performing.

1:19:53.876 --> 1:19:57.836
It's a touring car that is fast
and powerful as any racing car.

1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:00.491
[interviewer] And, can this
new car of yours be all of that?

1:20:00.534 --> 1:20:02.232
[Ferruccio] Oh, it can be
all of that and more.

1:20:02.275 --> 1:20:05.322
It is a thing of beauty.

1:20:05.365 --> 1:20:08.020
But a thing of beauty
can only be a thing of beauty
if it's shared.

1:20:08.064 --> 1:20:14.244
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the world press,
I give you Lamborghini GT!

1:20:14.287 --> 1:20:16.463
[applause]

1:20:21.773 --> 1:20:24.471
My friends, my friends,
I can see in your eyes

1:20:24.515 --> 1:20:26.734
how you love my car
but don't be shy.

1:20:26.778 --> 1:20:30.869
To drive a Lamborghini,
to own a Lamborghini,
you must not be shy.

1:20:30.913 --> 1:20:33.089
Mr. Lamborghini,
I know there are many questions

1:20:33.132 --> 1:20:34.481
about what's under the hood
of this car,

1:20:34.525 --> 1:20:36.092
but my first question is:

1:20:36.135 --> 1:20:38.616
- what is the price tag
of the Lamborghini GT?
- [chuckles]

1:20:38.659 --> 1:20:41.010
- What is the price
of a beautiful woman?
- Hm.

1:20:41.053 --> 1:20:44.317
A great bottle of wine?
A pasta you remember
the rest of your life?

1:20:44.361 --> 1:20:46.929
These things are worth
whatever they ask you
to pay for them.

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:50.323
You buy a Ferrari
when you want to be someone.

1:20:50.367 --> 1:20:52.935
You buy a Lamborghini
when you are someone.

1:20:54.023 --> 1:20:55.894
Lamborghini.

1:20:57.548 --> 1:20:59.550
Bravo, bravo.

1:21:03.684 --> 1:21:05.599
[engine revving]

1:21:21.093 --> 1:21:22.790
[tires screeching]

1:21:34.367 --> 1:21:37.153
[people chanting]
Strike, strike,
strike Lamborghini.

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:40.678
Strike, strike,
strike Lamborghini.

1:21:40.721 --> 1:21:42.332
[reporter]
After a decades-long high,

1:21:42.375 --> 1:21:43.811
everything has come
crashing down

1:21:43.855 --> 1:21:45.509
in a crushing blow
to the post-war

1:21:45.552 --> 1:21:46.902
automobile industry.

1:21:46.945 --> 1:21:49.078
Severe government restrictions
dealt the latest blow

1:21:49.121 --> 1:21:51.645
to an industry
that was already on its knees.

1:21:51.689 --> 1:21:53.256
The combination
of union strikes,

1:21:53.299 --> 1:21:55.388
and a 300 percent increase
in the price of oil,

1:21:55.432 --> 1:21:57.782
has proven
more damaging to Italy

1:21:57.825 --> 1:22:00.741
than other European
industrial nations.

1:22:00.785 --> 1:22:02.569
Even Ferruccio Lamborghini,

1:22:02.613 --> 1:22:04.615
who's famous for having
personally negotiated

1:22:04.658 --> 1:22:07.400
his employee contracts,
has met his match

1:22:07.444 --> 1:22:10.055
in the power of the automotive
industrial unions.

1:22:10.099 --> 1:22:13.798
There was a time when Ferruccio
was a working man himself,

1:22:13.841 --> 1:22:15.800
where are you now, Ferruccio?

1:22:15.843 --> 1:22:17.976
Ferruccio, where are you?
Speak up.

1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:19.456
Are you with
the working men and women

1:22:19.499 --> 1:22:20.544
of this world or aren't you?

1:22:20.587 --> 1:22:22.633
Where are you, Ferruccio?

1:22:22.676 --> 1:22:24.026
Where are you now, Ferruccio?

1:22:24.069 --> 1:22:27.116
Where? Huh? Where?
Where are you now?

1:22:27.159 --> 1:22:28.378
[TV shuts off]

1:22:28.421 --> 1:22:30.684
[dramatic music playing]

1:22:45.743 --> 1:22:48.920
Half the money from the sale
of the company will go to you.

1:22:48.964 --> 1:22:50.661
The rest to my brothers.

1:22:57.189 --> 1:22:59.104
I put a clause in the contract.

1:22:59.148 --> 1:23:01.715
They must keep the name
Lamborghini forever.

1:23:16.556 --> 1:23:17.993
How is the family?

1:23:19.733 --> 1:23:20.865
Good.

1:23:20.908 --> 1:23:22.127
How old?

1:23:23.302 --> 1:23:26.697
Girls are three and five.

1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:28.351
Ferruccio is two.

1:23:29.395 --> 1:23:31.310
His birthday was last Saturday.

1:23:31.354 --> 1:23:33.573
Two years old already.

1:23:34.618 --> 1:23:36.228
I should have been there.

1:23:36.272 --> 1:23:39.144
Oh, it's okay.
The gift was lovely.

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:42.843
He loves boats.
Plays with it in the tub.

1:23:42.887 --> 1:23:44.193
Won't take a bath without it.

1:23:44.236 --> 1:23:46.934
We call him Captain Ferruccio.

1:23:46.978 --> 1:23:48.197
[laughs]

1:23:54.638 --> 1:23:57.249
Have you heard?

1:23:57.293 --> 1:24:00.209
They've appointed me
Cavaliere del Lavoro.

1:24:00.252 --> 1:24:03.168
That's exciting.

1:24:03.212 --> 1:24:06.389
Now when I talk to the president
I can use the informal "tu".

1:24:10.610 --> 1:24:12.090
You've done it all.

1:24:12.134 --> 1:24:14.571
Everything that
you ever wanted.

1:24:18.096 --> 1:24:20.403
Was it worth it, Papa?

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:26.931
Tonino...

1:24:28.150 --> 1:24:31.675
It's okay.
I should get home now.

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:48.126
Ciao, Papa.

1:24:54.176 --> 1:24:55.829
[door opens]

1:25:05.970 --> 1:25:07.537
[engines idling]

1:25:25.816 --> 1:25:27.905
[engine revving]

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:39.134
[dramatic music playing]

1:27:56.749 --> 1:27:59.274
[engine starts]

1:28:00.449 --> 1:28:02.886
[engine revving]

1:28:24.299 --> 1:28:26.344
[dramatic music playing]

1:28:28.477 --> 1:28:30.392
[tires screeching]
