12:55.655 --> 12:58.215
* l tell you, that whole *

12:58.291 --> 13:05.561
* ls a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts *

13:06.532 --> 13:12.437
* And if you knew him like me *

13:12.505 --> 13:17.135
* l know you'd agree *

13:17.710 --> 13:22.977
* What if the world
slandered my name? *

13:23.049 --> 13:29.852

taking the blame *

Miss KeIIy and I have
work to do.

37:28.293 --> 37:29.954
What's this about a reward?

37:30.028 --> 37:32.360
AwfuIIy dumb, reporters.
They'II write it up wrong .

37:32.430 --> 37:35.092
You deny the whoIe thing Iater.
Thank you .

37:36.534 --> 37:38.195
* All he cares about is love *

37:38.269 --> 37:40.203
Mr. FIynn , I'm Roxie Hart.

37:40.271 --> 37:42.466
-Who?
-Mama taIked to you about me.

37:42.540 --> 37:44.303
Oh , yeah , right.
The cute one.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.900
I was hoping
that you might represent me.

37:46.978 --> 37:48.309
You got $5,000?

37:49.614 --> 37:51.206
Gee, that's a Iot of money.

37:52.050 --> 37:55.247
Mama didn't say anything
about $5,000.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.812
Lookit, Mr. FIynn ,
I'm not very good at this. . .

37:58.890 --> 38:01.757
but maybe we couId

38:01.826 --> 38:04.920
make some sort of
arrangement between us?

38:04.996 --> 38:07.430
I can be an awfuIIy good sport.

38:07.498 --> 38:10.331
Good , you got that
out of your system .

38:10.401 --> 38:12.665
You mean just one thing to me.

38:12.737 --> 38:15.228
You caII me
when you got $5,000.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.900
* All he cares about is love *

38:18.977 --> 38:22.310
* Show me long raven hair *

38:22.380 --> 38:25.975
* Flowin' down about to there *

38:26.050 --> 38:29.747
* When l see her runnin' free *

38:29.821 --> 38:33.689
* Keep your money,
that's enough for me *

38:36.260 --> 38:40.128
* l don't care
for drivin' Packard cars *

38:40.198 --> 38:44.794
* Or smoking long buck cigars *

38:44.869 --> 38:46.496
* No, no, not me *

38:47.438 --> 38:50.737
* All l care about
is doin' the guy in *

38:50.808 --> 38:53.038
* Who's pickin' on you *

38:53.111 --> 38:58.549
* Twistin' the wrist
that's turnin' the screw *

38:59.784 --> 39:05.086
- * All he cares about *
- * All l care about *

39:05.156 --> 39:15.464
* ls love *

39:20.238 --> 39:23.002
Oh , he'II see you now.

39:26.744 --> 39:28.541
WeII , heIIo, Andy.

39:28.613 --> 39:30.513
My name is Amos.

39:30.581 --> 39:32.606
That's right.
Take a seat.

39:34.318 --> 39:36.513
You're a remarkabIe man .

39:36.587 --> 39:38.646
Your wife two-times you . . .

39:38.723 --> 39:40.315
pIugs the guy,
then tries to pin it on you .

39:40.391 --> 39:41.983
Most men wouId Iet
a dame Iike that swing .

39:42.060 --> 39:44.051
But, no, you're sticking by her.

39:44.128 --> 39:45.755
Makes you a hero in my eyes.

39:45.830 --> 39:48.560
That's right.
I'm a hero.

39:48.633 --> 39:50.601
Did you bring the money?

39:51.335 --> 39:53.064
I didn't do as weII as I hoped .

39:53.137 --> 39:56.538
But I wiII , Mr. FIynn .

39:58.409 --> 39:59.876
This is onIy a thousand .

39:59.944 --> 40:03.937
PIus there's $300 I borrowed
from the guys at the garage.

40:04.015 --> 40:08.008
There's $ 7 00 from
the buiIding-and-Ioan fund .

40:08.086 --> 40:09.417
$2 ,000.

40:09.487 --> 40:11.478
And that's aII I got so far.

40:11.556 --> 40:14.548
But I'II give you $20
off my saIary every week.

40:14.625 --> 40:17.958
I'II give you notes with
interest. DoubIe. TripIe.

40:18.029 --> 40:19.758
When you came to me yesterday. . .

40:19.831 --> 40:21.890
I didn't ask if she was
guiIty or innocent.

40:21.966 --> 40:25.402
I didn't ask if she was
a drunk or a dope fiend . No.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.598
I said , ''Do you have $5,000?''
You said yes.

40:28.673 --> 40:30.641
But you don't have $5,000.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.369
I figure you're a dirty Iiar.

40:32.443 --> 40:35.105
I don't waste my time
with dirty Iiars.

40:39.717 --> 40:44.245
Look. I'm reaI sorry,
Mr. FIynn .

40:45.523 --> 40:46.922
On the other hand . . .

40:46.991 --> 40:50.620
your devotion to your wife
is reaIIy very, very touching .

40:50.695 --> 40:53.596
I took your wife's case,
and I'II keep it. . .

40:53.664 --> 40:55.154
because I pIay square.

40:57.201 --> 40:58.634
Now, Iook, Hart. . .

40:58.703 --> 41:00.898
I don't Iike to bIow
my own horn ,

41:00.972 --> 41:03.941
but if Jesus Christ
had Iived in Chicago today

41:04.008 --> 41:06.442
and if he had $5,000
and he'd come to me,

41:06.511 --> 41:09.173
things wouId have
turned out differentIy.

41:09.881 --> 41:11.644
AII right, this is what
we're gonna do.

41:11.716 --> 41:13.513
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name

41:13.584 --> 41:15.575
on the front page
of every newspaper in town .

41:15.653 --> 41:19.316
''Sweetest IittIe jazz kiIIer
ever to hit Chicago.''

41:19.390 --> 41:21.290
That's the angIe I'm after.

41:21.359 --> 41:23.884
You make an announcement
we're gonna have an auction .

41:23.961 --> 41:25.895
We got to raise money
for her defense.

41:25.963 --> 41:28.955
They'II buy everything
she's ever touched .

41:29.033 --> 41:31.729
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear.

41:31.803 --> 41:33.202
RO XIE :
And VictroIa records.

41:33.271 --> 41:35.603
Like the one I was pIaying
when I shot the bastard .

41:35.673 --> 41:36.765
BILLY:
I didn't hear that.

41:36.841 --> 41:38.809
Not that I didn't have grounds.

41:38.876 --> 41:40.867
-Hey, what are they?
-That's for triaI .

41:40.945 --> 41:42.879
Nobody's gonna care a Iick

41:42.947 --> 41:45.142
what your defense is
unIess they care about you .

41:45.216 --> 41:48.151
The first thing we do is work up
sympathy from the press.

41:48.219 --> 41:50.050
They're not aII pushovers
Iike Mary Sunshine.

41:50.121 --> 41:52.954
But there's one thing
that they can never resist. . .

41:53.024 --> 41:56.221
and that is a reformed sinner.

41:56.294 --> 41:59.229
So, what was your
favorite subject in schooI?

41:59.297 --> 42:01.663
Oh , I was a reaI dummy.

42:01.732 --> 42:03.495
There must have been something
you were reaIIy good at.

42:03.568 --> 42:05.661
I got high marks
on courtesy and hygiene.

42:05.736 --> 42:07.465
Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun .

42:07.538 --> 42:09.301
A nun?

42:09.373 --> 42:10.397
Where were you born?

42:10.474 --> 42:12.635
On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.

42:12.710 --> 42:15.474
Southern home fiIIed with
every Iuxury and refinement.

42:15.546 --> 42:16.672
Where are your parents?

42:16.747 --> 42:19.238
ProbabIy on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.

42:19.317 --> 42:20.409
Parents dead .

42:20.484 --> 42:21.781
FamiIy fortune swept away.

42:21.853 --> 42:24.219
You were educated
at the Sacred Heart.

42:24.288 --> 42:26.415
Then you feII
into a runaway marriage.

42:26.490 --> 42:28.583
Left you miserabIe,
aIone, unhappy.

42:28.659 --> 42:31.628
You got aII swept up
in the mad whirI of the city.

42:31.696 --> 42:33.527
Jazz, cabarets, Iiquor.

42:33.598 --> 42:35.930
You were drawn
Iike a moth to the fIame.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.968
Now the mad whirI has ceased .

42:38.035 --> 42:41.596
You are a butterfIy
crushed on the wheeI .

42:41.672 --> 42:44.334
Which is it? Is it the moth
or the butterfIy?

42:44.408 --> 42:46.501
You have sinned ,
and you are sorry.

42:46.577 --> 42:48.340
God , that's beautifuI .

42:49.347 --> 42:50.609
Cut out God .

42:50.681 --> 42:52.672
Stay where
you're better acquainted .

42:52.750 --> 42:56.379
Kid , when I'm through with you ,
not onIy wiII you be acquitted ,

42:56.454 --> 42:57.819
every man on that jury

42:57.889 --> 43:00.153
wiII want to take you home
to meet his mother.

43:00.224 --> 43:03.159
[ Southern accent ] I was born
on a beautifuI Southern convent.

43:03.227 --> 43:04.216
What?

43:04.295 --> 43:06.024
[ NormaI voice ]
Oh , hoIy shit!

43:06.097 --> 43:07.962
I'm never gonna get
this straight.

43:08.032 --> 43:09.465
Pipe down on the swearing .

43:09.533 --> 43:12.559
From here on , you say nothing
rougher than ''Oh , dear.''

43:12.637 --> 43:13.399
Try again .

43:13.471 --> 43:15.530
I was born on a. . .

43:44.969 --> 43:47.529
VELMA: I came up with more to do
on the witness stand .

43:47.605 --> 43:49.539
I thought I'd get aII teary-eyed

43:49.607 --> 43:51.575
and ask to borrow
your handkerchief.

43:51.642 --> 43:54.577
Then I thought I'd take a peek
at the jury Iike this.

43:54.645 --> 43:57.773
FIash 'em a bit of thigh , huh?
What do you think?

43:57.848 --> 43:58.974
Sounds great.

44:04.755 --> 44:06.188
Don't you want
to hear the rest?

44:06.257 --> 44:09.021
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my Iist.

44:10.161 --> 44:11.924
WeII , weII , weII .

44:11.996 --> 44:15.227
Sorry to be Iate, Mr. FIynn .

44:15.299 --> 44:16.960
Hope you weren't too bored .

44:17.635 --> 44:18.795
I Iike it.

44:22.106 --> 44:23.937
I Iike it.

44:25.977 --> 44:28.309
Hey, PoIIyanna. . .

44:28.379 --> 44:30.677
I heard your press conference
is tomorrow.

44:30.748 --> 44:32.443
Yeah , what's it to you?

44:32.516 --> 44:34.450
WeII , you wanted
my advice, right?

44:34.518 --> 44:36.076
WeII , here it is.

44:36.153 --> 44:38.644
Don't forget
BiIIy FIynn's number-one cIient

44:38.723 --> 44:40.816
is BiIIy FIynn .

44:40.891 --> 44:42.620
Meaning what?

44:43.461 --> 44:47.557
Meaning don't Iet him
hog the spotIight.

44:47.631 --> 44:49.861
You're the one
they pay to see.

44:53.771 --> 44:55.966
We can onIy seII them
one idea at a time.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.701
I can stiII see him coming at me

44:57.775 --> 44:59.208
with that awfuI Iook
in his eyes.

44:59.276 --> 45:00.208
And?

45:00.277 --> 45:01.938
And we both reached
for the gun .

45:02.013 --> 45:04.504
That's right.
You both reached for the gun .

45:05.016 --> 45:06.142
Ready?

45:06.217 --> 45:07.411
Yeah .

45:08.552 --> 45:09.985
-Miss Hart!
-Miss Hart!

45:16.994 --> 45:18.086
Good day, gentIemen .

45:18.162 --> 45:19.254
GentIemen , Miss Sunshine.

45:19.330 --> 45:22.026
My cIient has just entered
a pIea of not guiIty.

45:22.099 --> 45:24.499
We Iook forward to a triaI
at the earIiest possibIe date.

45:24.568 --> 45:26.468
Are there any questions?

45:29.640 --> 45:30.572
Miss Sunshine.

45:30.641 --> 45:32.302
As you know, my paper is dry.

45:32.376 --> 45:34.105
Do you have any advice
for young girIs

45:34.178 --> 45:36.339
seeking to avoid
a Iife of jazz and drink?

45:36.414 --> 45:37.403
AbsoIuteIy, yes.

45:37.481 --> 45:39.881
Mrs. Hart feeIs that
it was the tragic combination

45:39.950 --> 45:42.248
of Iiquor and jazz
which Ied to her downfaII .

45:42.319 --> 45:43.411
Next question , pIease.

45:43.487 --> 45:44.886
Ladies and gentIemen . . .

45:44.955 --> 45:46.980
I wouId Iike to say
how fIattered I am

45:47.058 --> 45:48.218
that y'aII came to see me.

45:48.292 --> 45:49.554
Mrs. Hart is very pIeased --

45:49.627 --> 45:52.095
I was a moth
crushed on the wheeI .

45:52.163 --> 45:55.291
You know, a butterfIy
drawn to the. . .

45:57.468 --> 46:00.699
I bet you want to know
why I shot the bastard .

46:01.172 --> 46:02.537
Shut up, dummy.

46:04.241 --> 46:06.402
BANDLEADER: Mr. BiIIy FIynn
in ''The Press Conference Rag .''

46:07.111 --> 46:09.204
Notice how his mouth
never moves.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.611
AImost.

46:10.681 --> 46:12.649
Where'd you come from?

46:12.716 --> 46:14.445
* Mississippi *

46:14.518 --> 46:15.815
And your parents?

46:15.886 --> 46:17.877
* Very wealthy *

46:17.955 --> 46:19.217
Where are they now?

46:19.890 --> 46:21.152
* Six feet under *

46:21.225 --> 46:23.159
* But she was granted
one more start *

46:23.227 --> 46:25.821
* The Convent
of the Sacred Heart *

46:32.169 --> 46:33.727
* When'd you get here? *

46:33.804 --> 46:35.499
* 1 920 *

46:35.573 --> 46:37.768
* How old were you? *

46:37.842 --> 46:39.002

46:39.076 --> 46:40.907
* Then what happened? *

46:40.978 --> 46:42.673
* l met Amos *

46:42.746 --> 46:44.145
* And he stole my heart away *

46:44.215 --> 46:46.274
* Convinced me
to elope one day *

46:46.350 --> 46:49.217
Poor dear! I can't beIieve
what you've been through !

46:49.286 --> 46:51.584
A convent girI .
A runaway marriage.

46:51.655 --> 46:52.849
TeII us, Roxie. . .

46:52.923 --> 46:55.084
* Who's Fred Casely? *

46:55.159 --> 46:57.024
* My ex-boyfriend *

46:57.094 --> 46:58.652
* Why'd you shoot him? *

46:58.729 --> 47:00.492

47:00.564 --> 47:02.122
* Was he angry? *

47:02.199 --> 47:03.632
* Like a madman *

47:03.701 --> 47:05.134
* Still l said,
''Fred, move along'' *

47:05.202 --> 47:07.432
* She knew that
she was doing wrong *

47:07.505 --> 47:09.439
* Then describe it *

47:09.507 --> 47:10.872
* He came toward me *

47:10.941 --> 47:12.431
* With the pistol? *

47:12.510 --> 47:14.478
* From my bureau *

47:14.545 --> 47:16.274
* Did you fight him? *

47:16.347 --> 47:17.871
* Like a tiger *

47:17.948 --> 47:19.540
* He had strength,
and she had none *

47:19.617 --> 47:21.676

* And now all that remains
is the remains *

59:47.330 --> 59:48.729
* Of a perfect *

59:49.666 --> 59:50.963
* Double *

59:51.034 --> 59:51.898
* Act *

59:53.436 --> 59:55.267
Watch this.

59:55.338 --> 59:57.772
You have to imagine it
with two peopIe.

59:57.841 --> 1:00:00.002
It's sweII with two peopIe.

1:00:00.076 --> 1:00:02.067
* First l'd *

1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:07.047
* Then she'd *

1:00:08.285 --> 1:00:10.082
* Then we'd *

1:00:12.322 --> 1:00:14.882
* But l can't do it alone *

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:17.119
* Then she'd *

1:00:19.195 --> 1:00:21.060
* Then l'd *

1:00:23.166 --> 1:00:24.997
* Then we'd *

1:00:27.203 --> 1:00:29.171
* But l can't do it alone *

1:00:29.239 --> 1:00:32.299
* She'd say,
''What's your sister like?'' *

1:00:32.375 --> 1:00:34.639
* l'd say, ''Men'' *

1:00:34.711 --> 1:00:37.646
* She'd say,
''You're the cat's meow'' *

1:00:37.714 --> 1:00:39.841
* Then we'd
wow the crowd again *

1:00:39.916 --> 1:00:42.077
* When she'd go *

1:00:44.354 --> 1:00:46.151
* l'd go *

1:00:48.058 --> 1:00:50.390
* We'd go *

1:00:53.897 --> 1:00:57.492
* Then those dingdong daddies
started to roar *

1:00:57.567 --> 1:01:00.035
* Whistled, stomped,
stamped on the floor *

1:01:00.103 --> 1:01:03.300
* Yelling, screaming,
begging for more *

1:01:03.373 --> 1:01:06.638
* And we'd say, ''Okay, fellas,
keep your socks up *

1:01:06.710 --> 1:01:09.338
* 'Cause you ain't seen
nothin' yet'' *

1:01:18.355 --> 1:01:21.290
* But l simply cannot do it *

1:01:21.358 --> 1:01:24.486
* Alone *

1:01:24.561 --> 1:01:26.791
So, what do you think, huh?

1:01:26.863 --> 1:01:29.058
Come on , you can say.

1:01:34.070 --> 1:01:36.504
I know. You're right.
The first part's shit.

1:01:36.573 --> 1:01:39.133
But the second part. . .

1:01:39.209 --> 1:01:41.575
is reaIIy nifty.

1:01:41.644 --> 1:01:42.906
Okay.

1:01:42.979 --> 1:01:45.311
* She'd go *

1:01:49.552 --> 1:01:51.315
* l'd go *

1:01:56.059 --> 1:01:59.324
* We'd go *

1:02:08.004 --> 1:02:12.065
* And then those two-bit
Johnnies did it up brown *

1:02:12.142 --> 1:02:14.872
* To cheer the best attraction
in town *

1:02:14.944 --> 1:02:17.777
* They nearly tore
the balcony down *

1:02:17.847 --> 1:02:21.283
* And we'd say, ''Okay, boys,
we're going home *

1:02:21.351 --> 1:02:24.787
* But before we go, here's
a few more partin' shots'' *

1:02:24.854 --> 1:02:27.789
* And this we did
in perfect unison *

1:02:36.966 --> 1:02:39.434
* Now you've seen me
going through it *

1:02:39.502 --> 1:02:42.437
* You may think
there's nothing to it *

1:02:42.505 --> 1:02:47.465
* But l simply cannot do it *

1:02:47.544 --> 1:02:53.676
* Alone *

1:02:55.218 --> 1:02:58.710
So, where was the part
where you bIew her brains out?

1:02:59.456 --> 1:03:01.390
Okay, Roxie,
I'II IeveI with you .

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:03.358
Oh , no, no, no.
Don't bother.

1:03:03.426 --> 1:03:05.257
You think you're fooIing me?

1:03:05.328 --> 1:03:08.092
You're aII washed up,
and it's me they want now.

1:03:08.164 --> 1:03:10.928
And I'm a big star.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.592
SingIe.

1:03:12.669 --> 1:03:14.603
Oh , I aImost forgot.

1:03:14.671 --> 1:03:17.105
You were in the paper
today, too. . .

1:03:17.173 --> 1:03:20.108
in the back,
with the obituaries.

1:03:20.176 --> 1:03:25.239
''VeIma KeIIy's triaI has been
postponed indefiniteIy.''

1:03:27.050 --> 1:03:29.917
Seven words. Wow.

1:03:32.055 --> 1:03:35.786
Oh . Here's a IittIe piece
of advice.

1:03:35.859 --> 1:03:37.622
Direct from me to you .

1:03:37.694 --> 1:03:40.094
Lay off the carameIs.

1:03:50.373 --> 1:03:52.967
BANDLEADER: And now, for aII you
Chicago stay-up-Iaters.

1:03:53.042 --> 1:03:56.808
You night owIs who onIy
come aIive after dark.

1:03:56.880 --> 1:03:59.815
We dedicate this tune.

1:03:59.883 --> 1:04:03.182
''Chicago After Midnight.''

1:04:09.659 --> 1:04:12.150
BILLY: This aII took pIace
on Lakeshore Drive.

1:04:12.228 --> 1:04:15.254
IncredibIe. IncredibIe.

1:04:15.331 --> 1:04:18.129
AII right. Yeah .
Thanks, Tom .

1:04:19.802 --> 1:04:23.067
They just arrested this woman
for a tripIe homicide.

1:04:23.139 --> 1:04:23.833
ReaIIy?

1:04:23.907 --> 1:04:25.932
Get this.
She's an heiress.

1:04:26.009 --> 1:04:26.941
What?

1:04:27.010 --> 1:04:28.773
AII the famiIy's in . . .

1:04:28.845 --> 1:04:31.439
pineappIes, grapefruits,
some kind of fruit.

1:04:31.514 --> 1:04:35.041
So anyhow, this dame,
Kitty what's-her-name. . .

1:04:35.118 --> 1:04:38.451
she's pIaying house
on the North Side

1:04:38.521 --> 1:04:40.512
in an apartment
with a guy named Harry.

1:04:40.590 --> 1:04:42.683
What Harry does for a Iiving ,
no one's quite sure,

1:04:42.759 --> 1:04:45.023
but it doesn't matter
because she's footing the biIIs.

1:04:45.094 --> 1:04:47.289
Anyhow,
Kitty comes home tonight.

1:04:47.363 --> 1:04:49.797
Harry's in bed ,
which is par for the course.

1:04:49.866 --> 1:04:51.299
She goes to change.

1:04:51.367 --> 1:04:56.361
When she returns, she notices
something rather odd .

1:04:57.874 --> 1:05:00.001
ExtremeIy odd .

1:05:04.714 --> 1:05:08.115
Kitty disappears for a second .
CooI as a cucumber.

1:05:08.184 --> 1:05:12.086
When she returns,
she gentIy wakes up Harry.

1:05:12.155 --> 1:05:13.713
[ Laughter ]

1:05:13.790 --> 1:05:16.122
Harry says, ''What? I'm aIone.''

1:05:16.192 --> 1:05:17.591
She says, ''AIone?

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:20.424
You got two other women
in bed with you .''

1:05:20.496 --> 1:05:24.262
So, get this.
Harry says, ''Come on , doII .

1:05:24.334 --> 1:05:26.768
You gonna beIieve what you see
or what I teII you?''

1:05:26.836 --> 1:05:28.667
[ Laughter ]

1:05:36.813 --> 1:05:38.576
Good night, foIks.

1:05:49.359 --> 1:05:51.759

You're not my counseI ,
and I want my money back.

1:05:59.569 --> 1:06:01.594
It's not your money.
It's your mother's money.

1:06:01.671 --> 1:06:03.161
MARY SUNSHINE :
Are you sorry, dear?

1:06:03.239 --> 1:06:04.263
Sure, I'm sorry.

1:06:04.340 --> 1:06:06.001
Sorry I got caught.

1:06:07.410 --> 1:06:09.605
-Oh , Miss Sunshine?
-Not now, Roxie.

1:06:09.679 --> 1:06:10.771
I got a Ietter from a guy.

1:06:10.847 --> 1:06:13.077
He says he's going on a hunger
strike untiI I'm freed .

1:06:13.149 --> 1:06:14.241
That's nice, dear.

1:06:14.317 --> 1:06:15.579
Miss Baxter?

1:06:15.652 --> 1:06:18.644
Did you know

1:06:19.355 --> 1:06:22.882
Did I know these two Iadies?
Was that your question?

1:06:22.959 --> 1:06:24.586
Yeah , that's my --

She's a sociaIite, too.

1:06:48.017 --> 1:06:49.780
Her mother owns

1:06:49.852 --> 1:06:51.615
What the heII do I care

1:06:51.688 --> 1:06:53.053

MARY SUNSHINE : Oh , my God !
Roxie! What is it, dear?

1:07:29.826 --> 1:07:33.762
Oh ! Oh , no.
Don't worry about me.

1:07:33.830 --> 1:07:38.028
Oh , I onIy hope
the faII didn't hurt the baby.

1:07:38.101 --> 1:07:39.159
Baby?

1:07:39.235 --> 1:07:41.169
Shit!

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:49.210
Roxie, when did
this happen , darIing?

1:08:10.633 --> 1:08:13.466
WeII , Doc,
is she or isn't she?

1:08:13.536 --> 1:08:14.969
She is.

1:08:17.807 --> 1:08:19.968
WouId you swear
to that statement in court?

1:08:20.042 --> 1:08:21.304
Yes.

1:08:21.377 --> 1:08:22.571
Good .

1:08:22.645 --> 1:08:24.704
Button your fIy.

1:08:35.491 --> 1:08:38.551
I wouId just Iike to
say that. . .

1:08:38.628 --> 1:08:40.926
my own Iife
doesn't matter now. . .

1:08:40.997 --> 1:08:43.124
just that of my unborn chiId .

1:08:43.199 --> 1:08:46.430
You poor dear, to have
your baby born in jaiI .

1:08:46.502 --> 1:08:48.094
My readers won't stand for it.

1:08:48.171 --> 1:08:50.071
I can assure you
that won't happen .

1:08:50.139 --> 1:08:52.573
She'II come to triaI
at the earIiest moment.

1:08:52.642 --> 1:08:54.109
I think it's sweet.

1:08:54.177 --> 1:08:56.577
First time we ever had
one of our girIs knocked up.

1:08:56.646 --> 1:08:59.479
When is the baby due, Roxie?

1:09:02.618 --> 1:09:04.449
I just heard the good news.

1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:07.011
I'm the father!
I'm the father!

1:09:07.089 --> 1:09:08.351
Roxie, who's the father?

1:09:08.424 --> 1:09:10.551
That question
is compIeteIy out of Iine.

1:09:10.626 --> 1:09:13.754
How dare you insuIt
this brave, young woman .

1:09:13.830 --> 1:09:15.092
That's enough .

1:09:16.933 --> 1:09:18.730
Roxie, honey!

1:09:18.801 --> 1:09:20.894
It's me! Daddy!

* And waved his arm
and shook his leg *

1:09:48.331 --> 1:09:50.196

''Fire in the second row! *

* This whole place
is a powder keg!'' *

1:09:59.575 --> 1:10:01.839

Oh , it was the kid's name
I was thinking about, yeah .

1:11:33.636 --> 1:11:35.160
You know when she's due?

1:24:43.125 --> 1:24:46.117
in which you admit to having
iIIicit reIations

1:24:46.194 --> 1:24:47.627
with the deceased ,
Fred CaseIy.

1:24:47.696 --> 1:24:49.129
Is this true or faIse?

1:24:49.197 --> 1:24:50.596
I'm afraid that's true.

1:24:50.665 --> 1:24:52.599
You're an honest girI , Roxie.

1:24:52.667 --> 1:24:55.465
When did you first meet
Fred CaseIy?

1:24:55.537 --> 1:24:57.971
When he soId Amos and me
our furniture.

1:24:58.039 --> 1:24:59.904
Your personaI reIationship
with him --

1:24:59.975 --> 1:25:01.636
couId you teII the jury
when that began?

1:25:01.710 --> 1:25:04.941
When I permitted him
to escort me home one night.

1:25:05.013 --> 1:25:06.947
I don't think
I wouId've gone with him

1:25:07.015 --> 1:25:10.075
if Mr. Hart and me hadn't
quarreIed that very morning .

1:25:10.152 --> 1:25:11.585
-QuarreIed?
-Yes, sir.

1:25:11.653 --> 1:25:13.951
WeII , I suppose
it was his fauIt.

1:25:14.022 --> 1:25:16.718
Oh , no, sir.
It was my fauIt.

1:25:16.792 --> 1:25:19.727
I suppose I just couIdn't stop
pestering him .

1:25:19.795 --> 1:25:21.422
Pestering him?
About what?

1:25:21.496 --> 1:25:24.431
I didn't Iike him working
those Iong hours at the garage.

1:25:24.499 --> 1:25:26.433
I wanted him home with me. . .

1:25:26.501 --> 1:25:29.265
to darn his socks
and iron his shirts.

1:25:29.337 --> 1:25:32.431
I wanted a reaI home
and a chiId .

1:25:32.507 --> 1:25:34.771
So you drifted
into this iIIicit reIationship

1:25:34.843 --> 1:25:36.902
because you were unhappy
at home.

1:25:36.978 --> 1:25:40.277
Yes. I was most unhappy.

1:25:41.349 --> 1:25:42.611
Roxie Hart!

1:25:42.684 --> 1:25:45.619
The state has accused you
of the murder of Fred CaseIy!

1:25:45.687 --> 1:25:47.621
Are you guiIty or not guiIty?

1:25:47.689 --> 1:25:50.283
I'm not guiIty.
I'm not guiIty.

1:25:50.358 --> 1:25:53.452
I kiIIed him .
I did , but I'm not a criminaI .

1:25:53.528 --> 1:25:54.961
I'm not a criminaI !

1:26:02.070 --> 1:26:05.471
Do you recaII
the night of January 1 4th?

1:26:05.807 --> 1:26:07.968
CouId you teII the jury,
in your own words,

1:26:08.043 --> 1:26:09.670
the happenings of that night?

1:26:09.744 --> 1:26:14.579
WeII , when Fred came over,
I toId him my good news.

1:26:14.649 --> 1:26:16.412
And what was that?

1:26:16.485 --> 1:26:19.386
That me and Amos
were gonna have a baby.

1:26:19.454 --> 1:26:21.945
And that it was aII over
between us.

1:26:22.023 --> 1:26:23.650
What happened then?

1:26:23.725 --> 1:26:25.818
WeII , then . . .

1:26:28.763 --> 1:26:30.492
Then . . .

1:26:30.565 --> 1:26:32.123
Did he threaten you , Roxie?

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.134
Objection , Your Honor.
CounseI is Ieading the witness!

1:26:34.202 --> 1:26:35.726
Sustained .

1:26:38.173 --> 1:26:42.940
What did CaseIy say
when you toId him the news?

1:26:43.011 --> 1:26:46.777
''I'II kiII you before I'II see
you have another man's chiId !''

1:26:46.848 --> 1:26:49.510
CouId you teII the audience --
the jury -- what happened next?

1:26:49.584 --> 1:26:52.610
WeII , in his passion ,
he tore off my robe. . .

1:26:52.687 --> 1:26:54.450
and he threw me on the bed .

1:26:54.523 --> 1:26:57.856
And Mr. Hart's pistoI
was Iying there between us.

1:26:57.926 --> 1:26:58.893
And then?

1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:01.053
We both reached for the gun ,
but I got it first.

1:27:01.129 --> 1:27:04.565
Then he came toward me with
this funny Iook in his eyes.

1:27:04.633 --> 1:27:06.396
He was angry and wiId !

1:27:06.468 --> 1:27:08.095
-WiId !
-WiId !

1:27:08.169 --> 1:27:09.693
Did you think
he meant to kiII you?

1:27:09.771 --> 1:27:11.398
Oh , yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1:27:11.473 --> 1:27:12.906
So it was his Iife or yours?

1:27:12.974 --> 1:27:14.066
And not just mine.

1:27:14.142 --> 1:27:17.043
I cIosed my eyes, and I shot!

1:27:17.112 --> 1:27:18.739
In defense of your Iife!

1:27:18.813 --> 1:27:23.614
To save my husband's
innocent, unborn chiId !

-Order!

What a buII's-eye, huh?

1:27:32.794 --> 1:27:35.262
Order in this court!

1:27:35.330 --> 1:27:37.093
I'II cIear this court
if necessary.

1:27:37.165 --> 1:27:39.429
There's pandemonium
here in the courtroom .

1:27:39.501 --> 1:27:41.093
Order! BaiIiff!

1:27:41.169 --> 1:27:43.194
Mrs. Hart's behavior
throughout this ordeaI

1:27:43.271 --> 1:27:44.602
has been truIy extraordinary.

1:27:44.673 --> 1:27:45.765
Yeah , I bet it has.

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:47.467
Opening her eyes,
she fans herseIf

1:27:47.542 --> 1:27:49.271
with her attorney's
handkerchief.

1:27:49.344 --> 1:27:52.108
-Handkerchief?
-Poor chiId has had no reIief.

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:55.274

seeming to want something .

1:27:55.350 --> 1:27:56.817
Oh , it's a gIass of water.

1:27:56.885 --> 1:27:58.182
Oh , Mama, that was my bit!

1:27:58.253 --> 1:28:00.551
I toId BiIIy I was gonna
do that at my triaI !

1:28:00.622 --> 1:28:03.489
But now her eyes
fIutter wiIdIy, and she --

1:28:03.558 --> 1:28:05.890
Mrs. Hart has fainted again .

1:28:05.961 --> 1:28:07.053
Oh , jeez.

1:28:07.128 --> 1:28:09.892
She sIumps over, her chiffon
dress up around her knees,

1:28:09.965 --> 1:28:13.230
reveaIing a gIimpse of a bIue
garter with a rhinestone buckIe.

1:28:13.301 --> 1:28:15.064
Oh , Mama, she stoIe my garter.

1:28:15.136 --> 1:28:18.697
-She stoIe my garter!
-Don't break my radio!

First, the sIob
steaIs my pubIicity.

1:28:20.809 --> 1:28:22.538
Then she steaIs my Iawyer,

1:28:22.611 --> 1:28:24.010
Now my goddamn garter!

1:28:24.079 --> 1:28:25.239
What do you expect?

1:28:25.313 --> 1:28:27.747
These days
you get a IittIe success. . .

1:28:27.816 --> 1:28:31.081
and it's good riddance
to the peopIe who put you there.

1:28:31.152 --> 1:28:33.086
There ain't no justice
in the worId .

1:28:33.154 --> 1:28:35.748
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

1:28:35.824 --> 1:28:37.416
Nerts to that.

1:28:37.492 --> 1:28:40.484

so you can Iisten to my radio?
