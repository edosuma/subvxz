There you are.

Sarah, I've been looking
all over for you.

Where'd you go?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.099
Sarah.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.061
Babe! What is it?
What happened?

35:12.570 --> 35:14.731
I used to lie awake at night

35:14.738 --> 35:18.731
imagining my parents
were still alive.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.903
I came up
with all these crazy scenarios.

35:22.162 --> 35:27.247
Like, they were spies dropped
behind the iron curtain.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.788
They were missionaries
out saving the world.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.879
Left me with my grandmother
to keep me safe.

35:34.842 --> 35:38.175
I never imagined
that my dad was Larry Flynt,

35:38.178 --> 35:40.089
and my mom was Linda Lovelace.

35:40.097 --> 35:44.966
I mean, listen... it's not a good thing,
what you found out.

35:44.977 --> 35:49.095
It's shocking and terrible, but...

35:49.106 --> 35:51.097
What?

35:51.442 --> 35:55.902
You wanted to know the truth.
Now you do.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.361
Your parents weren't fallen angels,

35:58.365 --> 36:00.276
but they weren't these innocent
martyrs, either, you know.

36:00.284 --> 36:04.243
They were weird,
screwed-up, imperfect people.

46:25.951 --> 46:28.283
How could a loving God
allow this to happen?

But the murder of Verna McBride
and of Rachel and Brian Ingram,

46:34.542 --> 46:37.454
these are not the works of God.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.453
These are the works of men.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.581
We're all born with fallen nature,

46:42.592 --> 46:46.130
one that loves sin
and hates holiness.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.879
Stretching all the way back
to the original sin of Adam and Eve

46:48.890 --> 46:51.302
in the Garden of Eden,

46:51.309 --> 46:54.767
our first step away from God.

46:56.189 --> 47:02.185
There is a void, in each of us,
that we struggle to fill,

47:02.195 --> 47:06.734
but one that can only
be filled by God.

47:07.617 --> 47:13.453
By God's love.
By God's light.

47:14.332 --> 47:18.371
And our base desires
stand in our way...

47:18.378 --> 47:20.619
...and keep us from God's grace.

47:20.964 --> 47:24.627
Keep us lonely,
lost in the wilderness.

47:24.634 --> 47:28.001
Buried in secrets.

47:28.013 --> 47:32.131
Warping our good nature
into something unrecognizable.

47:32.142 --> 47:35.726
And there is only one way
back to God,

47:36.521 --> 47:40.855
and that is by letting Him
into your heart...

47:40.859 --> 47:44.943
and following His Word.

47:45.238 --> 47:50.198
"Beware of false prophets,
who come to you in sheep's clothing.

47:50.201 --> 47:54.319

47:54.331 --> 47:57.414
There is only one God.

47:57.417 --> 48:01.285
And only one path to salvation.

48:02.339 --> 48:04.671
Back already.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.960
You know what happened.

You behind this?

48:08.178 --> 48:10.715
Is it the work
of one of your protégés?

48:10.722 --> 48:11.837
-No.
-Really?

48:11.848 --> 48:13.930
Because he was dressed exactly
the same way that you were dressed

48:13.933 --> 48:15.764
the night you murdered
my parents.

48:17.479 --> 48:20.016
Don't tell me you didn't plan this.

48:22.650 --> 48:25.687
I don't receive visitors here.
Except for you.

48:25.695 --> 48:28.858

And of course my religious counsel.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.614
What about e-mail?
Regular mail?

48:31.618 --> 48:32.983
I don't send mail.

48:32.994 --> 48:35.485
Most of the mail I do get,
I don't read.

48:35.497 --> 48:37.158
Never had an e-mail account.

48:37.165 --> 48:40.202
Warden can verify all this,
if you don't believe me.

48:40.210 --> 48:42.496
Then, who is behind this?

48:42.504 --> 48:45.496
Who? I have no idea.

48:45.507 --> 48:48.089
But I might be able to help you
figure out why.

48:48.093 --> 48:50.459
First question I'd ask is:

48:50.470 --> 48:53.257
Why did Verna McBride
deserve to die?

48:53.264 --> 48:57.223
-She didn't.
-Sarah... Sarah...

48:57.227 --> 48:59.388
If you're gonna catch him,
or her --

48:59.396 --> 49:01.057
Who said anything about catching?

49:01.064 --> 49:03.851
Then, you're gonna have to start
thinking like him.

49:03.858 --> 49:06.144
McBride died for a reason.
Why?

49:06.152 --> 49:08.188
I don't know.

49:08.196 --> 49:09.936
How did she die?

49:09.948 --> 49:14.317
The newspapers said blood loss,
but how, exactly?

49:15.954 --> 49:18.787
He cut off her hands.
And her feet.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.789
Why would he do that?

49:21.793 --> 49:22.953
'Cause he's crazy.

49:24.796 --> 49:27.583
That's right, Sarah,
get it all out of you.

49:27.590 --> 49:30.582
All the judgment and all
the righteousness, shake it out!

49:31.636 --> 49:35.925
Now, put your emotions aside
and get into the mind of this killer.

49:35.932 --> 49:38.765
Cutting off limbs. Why?

49:41.604 --> 49:44.471
Is it a punishment?

49:44.482 --> 49:46.939
Like in Saudi Arabia,
when you steal, they...

49:46.943 --> 49:49.810
They just cut off hands,
nothing else.

49:49.821 --> 49:52.062
Still... What did she take?

49:54.284 --> 49:56.570
Sarah?

49:57.454 --> 50:02.699
Videotapes. Her husband...
he was in some of them.

50:04.085 --> 50:06.167
So, you found them.

50:06.171 --> 50:08.207
You knew what they were doing?

50:11.134 --> 50:16.549
But Verna McBride's sin
wasn't greed or envy.

50:16.556 --> 50:19.468
The punishment
does not match the crime.

50:19.476 --> 50:20.340
What are you talking about?

50:20.351 --> 50:23.593
I'm talking about the punishment
for the sin of anger,

50:23.605 --> 50:27.018
to be dismembered, alive.

50:28.443 --> 50:29.808
This all goes back to the Bible.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.564
The Bible... Dante...

50:32.572 --> 50:35.814
Pope Gregory the Great,
St. Thomas Aquinas.

50:36.326 --> 50:40.035
Verna McBride paid the price
of her sin with her life,

50:40.038 --> 50:42.620
so if I were you,
I'd start looking there.

50:45.627 --> 50:48.539
This person's following
in your footsteps.

50:48.546 --> 50:52.255
Finishing what you started.

50:52.967 --> 50:54.832
Why would you want
to help stop it?
