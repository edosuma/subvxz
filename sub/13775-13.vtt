WEBVTT

00:00.661 --> 00:02.161
Ugh, this season.

00:02.281 --> 00:03.214
Sucked.

00:03.282 --> 00:04.416
So hard.

00:04.483 --> 00:06.117
Real disappointment.

00:06.185 --> 00:08.501
It ate my entire ass.

00:08.621 --> 00:09.972
I had a good time.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.141
Yeah, we get it, Pete.

00:12.209 --> 00:13.209
You're in the Shiva Bowl.

00:13.277 --> 00:15.712
Not only am I in the Shiva Bowl,
I'm in the Shiva Bowl with

00:15.780 --> 00:17.314
Ted; the Four Pete is imminent.

00:17.381 --> 00:18.848
My team has been unstoppable.

00:18.916 --> 00:21.918
I know, I mean, Adrian Peterson
has just been killing it for you.

00:21.985 --> 00:24.554
I should have drafted him,
and I blame you for that.

00:24.622 --> 00:25.588
Talk to the ob-gyn.

00:25.656 --> 00:29.526
I find it interesting that Kevin and Ruxin
both tangled with Shiva and now find

00:29.593 --> 00:31.328
themselves in The Sacko Bowl.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.931
Ruxin ran a vigorous Sacko Bowl
campaign for a second term.

00:34.998 --> 00:37.934
Two times in a row at The Sacko Bowl.

00:38.001 --> 00:40.203
If you win again, you're
gonna be bi-sack-sual.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.110
I'm not bi-sack-sual.

00:41.138 --> 00:42.071
Maybe bi-curious?

00:42.139 --> 00:45.241
I don't care who is the
Sacko, but we are doling out

00:45.309 --> 00:46.343
Sacko punishments this year.

00:46.410 --> 00:49.379
Can someone just promise me
that whoever loses must put on

00:49.447 --> 00:52.281
the Metro Books costume
and go on a rampage?

00:52.350 --> 00:54.283
Like the old Scrote Squad again.

00:54.352 --> 00:55.284
Ooh, Scrote Squad!

00:55.353 --> 00:56.619
What, what?

00:56.687 --> 00:57.721
I'm sorry, the Scrote Squad?

00:57.788 --> 00:58.788
Yeah, it's an old tradition.

00:58.856 --> 01:02.258
When we were seniors we used to go
around to freshmen and sack-tap them.

01:02.326 --> 01:04.461
Sounds incredibly heterosexual.

01:04.528 --> 01:05.488
It's not a sexual thing.

01:05.529 --> 01:07.530
It's a game that guys play and we...
yeah!

01:07.598 --> 01:08.965
We don't do that anymore.

01:09.032 --> 01:09.966
Do what? Whoa!

01:10.033 --> 01:11.968
That, we don't do that anymore, okay?

01:12.035 --> 01:12.969
I'm done.

01:13.036 --> 01:13.803
We're done.

01:13.871 --> 01:14.637
Done.

01:17.107 --> 01:18.207
Yeah.

01:18.275 --> 01:19.308
Now we're done.

01:19.377 --> 01:21.424
I can actually feel the
half hoodie on that one.

01:21.544 --> 01:25.322
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:25.442 --> 01:28.985
Guess what gift you don't
want for Christmas this year.

01:29.052 --> 01:31.153
A non-consensual dick
in your pussy, right?

01:31.221 --> 01:34.557
All of us, let's just close our eyes.

01:34.625 --> 01:35.958
Why would you close your eyes?!

01:36.026 --> 01:36.959
Do you know me?!

01:37.027 --> 01:39.496
Protect Your Holes.

01:39.563 --> 01:40.497
Okay? Boom.

01:40.564 --> 01:43.232
You just got to your car, and
a man shows up with these.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.066
What are they?

01:44.134 --> 01:45.067
Nunchucks.

01:45.135 --> 01:47.504
No, they are two dildos
connected by a chain.

01:47.571 --> 01:49.806
And guess what, ladies, they're
ribbed for your pleasure, okay?

01:49.874 --> 01:50.940
Oh, God.

01:51.008 --> 01:53.342
You think you're up against
some sort of martial arts kung

01:53.411 --> 01:56.413
fu expert, but what you don't
know is he has designs to put

01:56.480 --> 01:57.914
both of these inside of you.

01:57.981 --> 02:00.617
Boop-boop, boop-boop,
boop-boop, boop-boop, boop.

02:00.684 --> 02:03.019
Take it out, put it in
your mouth a little bit.

02:03.086 --> 02:05.006
Yakitty, yakitty, yakitty,
yakitty, yakitty, yak.

02:05.055 --> 02:07.296
You guys need to be always
aware no matter where you are.

02:07.324 --> 02:08.925
I really feel that at the ATM.

02:08.991 --> 02:09.758
Ass to mouth?

02:09.827 --> 02:11.461
When I'm getting money at the bank?

02:11.529 --> 02:12.261
Oh, the bank.

02:12.329 --> 02:14.030
You just feel like they're
gonna come up behind you.

02:14.097 --> 02:15.865
Well, of course, you're gorgeous.

02:15.933 --> 02:16.966
Yes, like here I am.

02:17.034 --> 02:18.367
Oh, I'm so vulnerable.

02:18.436 --> 02:19.368
To who?

02:19.437 --> 02:21.538
And then I'm like... "Hey, guy, whoa!"

02:21.605 --> 02:23.372
Pam, I think I see what's going on.

02:23.441 --> 02:26.321
When you turn around, you think men
are perceiving you as a sexual being.

02:26.376 --> 02:27.143
Yes.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.111
Men are just shocked you're
a woman, 'cause from the

02:29.179 --> 02:31.380
back, you kind of have, like,
a Barney Rubble physique.

02:31.449 --> 02:34.350
Sofia, I'm gonna get you up and have
you right here at the other ATM.

02:34.418 --> 02:35.618
Pam, you're taking out, like, 20

02:35.686 --> 02:38.455
bucks to buy, like, a box
of wine and sweatbands.

02:38.522 --> 02:44.494
The guy comes along, takes your 20 bucks,
pow, I'm gonna leave this money here.

02:44.562 --> 02:48.498
I'm going for this and I'm going for
the butt, and then I'm already inside.

02:48.566 --> 02:49.499
Oh, my God, he's so strong.

02:49.567 --> 02:50.500
Hey, hello, hi.

02:50.568 --> 02:51.501
Ruxin!

02:51.569 --> 02:53.503
Hey, babe, he's teaching us self-defense.

02:53.571 --> 02:56.506
Look, I can totally protect you
against anybody, all right, baby?

02:56.574 --> 02:57.507
Really? How about this?

02:57.575 --> 02:58.641
Hey, hey! Get out of here.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.176
"Hey, get out of here"?

03:00.243 --> 03:01.210
That's your move?

03:01.278 --> 03:02.211
This is weakness.

03:02.279 --> 03:05.482
Ladies, all of your husbands are
just the same. Ineffective.

03:05.549 --> 03:06.549
Let's get up.

03:06.617 --> 03:09.552
Okay, we're gonna learn a combination
series of punches here, okay?

03:09.620 --> 03:10.620
Where's my little helper?

03:10.621 --> 03:11.988
All right, right here, buddy.

03:12.055 --> 03:13.356
Right here. Here we go.

03:13.423 --> 03:16.058
Throat, groin, throat, groin.

03:16.126 --> 03:17.226
What is this?

03:17.294 --> 03:19.529
Did you give my son baby brass knuckles?

03:19.597 --> 03:21.664
No, I had baby brass
knuckles made for your son.

03:21.732 --> 03:24.701
We're gonna get out of here, okay,
'cause your uncle's a psychopath.

03:24.768 --> 03:26.703
Geoffrey, I'm your real father.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.070
Touchdown, whoo!

03:28.138 --> 03:29.906
Oh, hey.

03:29.974 --> 03:31.574
Sit down; I need to talk to you.

03:31.642 --> 03:32.876
You watching basketball?

03:32.943 --> 03:35.879
Yeah, well, apparently Taco
Corp needs to be at a zero

03:35.946 --> 03:37.213
balance by the end of the year.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.248
So I need to get rid of all my money.

03:39.316 --> 03:41.250
That's not what zero balance means.

03:41.318 --> 03:42.251
You're just a lawyer, okay?

03:42.319 --> 03:43.319
You're not an accountant.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.789
So basically, I need to spend all
of my money before December 31.

03:46.857 --> 03:49.392
Well, I can tell you one thing
that you can do, pay me.

03:49.459 --> 03:50.393
I will do that.

03:50.460 --> 03:55.231
I know about your little problem with
Sofia, and I'm gonna pay you with semen.

03:55.298 --> 03:59.135
There's nobody's semen I
want less in my wife than you, Taco.

03:59.202 --> 04:00.136
What are we talking about?

04:00.203 --> 04:02.238
Putting our jizz in Sofia
to make a new baby Ruxin?

04:02.305 --> 04:05.307
Apparently someone's too good to have
another man's semen in his wife.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.144
What? I am here to offer you
my jizz for Sofia's pregnancy.

04:08.211 --> 04:10.279
No, no, I offered my semen first.

04:10.347 --> 04:11.447
Whoa, whoa, hang on, man.

04:11.515 --> 04:12.448
How about this?

04:12.516 --> 04:16.084
We put our jizz together and we mix it
up in a kind of frothy jizz milkshake.

04:16.153 --> 04:16.920
Go on.

04:16.987 --> 04:19.088
When she's sleeping, we shove
it up in her business.

04:19.156 --> 04:20.089
Okay.

04:20.156 --> 04:23.237
Guess what, nine months later you're
raising the coolest freakin' kid in town.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.750
The results are in!

04:27.870 --> 04:29.764
My boys can swim!

04:29.884 --> 04:31.471
My yogurt's not curdled!

04:31.591 --> 04:33.018
Crank up the yogurt machine!

04:33.138 --> 04:35.010
We're back in business, baby!

04:35.078 --> 04:36.674
Big news, guys.

04:36.794 --> 04:41.617
Taco Corp is throwing a huge, expensive
New Year's Eve bash on January 31.

04:41.684 --> 04:43.284
I think you mean December 31.

04:43.352 --> 04:45.386
I don't know what day
it falls on this year.

04:45.454 --> 04:47.534
And as I say good-bye to
last year's money, I'm gonna

04:47.590 --> 04:49.992
introduce Taco Corp's
latest business venture.

04:50.059 --> 04:52.801
Booboozelas.

04:52.921 --> 04:54.863
The noisemaker from the
South African World Cup?

04:54.931 --> 04:56.031
Exactly.

04:58.824 --> 04:59.920
That's pleasant.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.860
There are literally thousands
of these just lying around, and

05:02.928 --> 05:04.429
I am going to repurpose them.

05:04.497 --> 05:05.578
How can you repurpose that?

05:05.631 --> 05:08.099
Well, my first idea was to turn
them into sex toys, but the

05:08.167 --> 05:10.968
Vibrazela was a little dangerous
and the Vagvoozela was a great

05:11.036 --> 05:12.637
design, but it was faulty.

05:12.705 --> 05:14.772
Um, take a look at it here.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.773
Okay, yeah.

05:15.841 --> 05:18.743
Rafi tried it, but he said the
foam right here was a little

05:18.811 --> 05:19.911
too tight on his junk.

05:19.978 --> 05:21.112
Oh, oh!

05:21.180 --> 05:23.114
But I'm gonna set my sights higher.

05:23.182 --> 05:25.550
I'm gonna tinker with these bad
boys until they produce the

05:25.618 --> 05:26.918
legendary brown note.

05:26.985 --> 05:28.587
And what might that be?

05:28.654 --> 05:31.656
An infrasonic frequency
that's so low that it causes

05:31.724 --> 05:34.392
human beings to lose
control of their bowels.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.628
I'm gonna sell it to the military.

05:36.696 --> 05:40.298
So Taco Corp's big creation
for 2013 is a horn that makes

05:40.366 --> 05:41.466
people go to the bathroom?

05:41.534 --> 05:45.337
Correction, a horn that makes
terrorists go to the bathroom.

05:45.404 --> 05:46.605
This is gonna be huge, boys.

05:46.672 --> 05:49.107
I'm gonna be nutting all
over the place in 2013.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.509
Well, I wouldn't be too sure of that, oh!

05:51.577 --> 05:52.977
What was that?

05:53.045 --> 05:54.246
What the hell are you doing?

05:54.313 --> 05:55.447
Scrote Squad!

05:55.514 --> 05:57.081
Oh, my testicles. Oh.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.618
He really is on a five-second delay.

05:59.685 --> 06:01.620
Wait, I thought we were
done with the scroting.

06:01.687 --> 06:03.855
I know we say that, right,
but we keep on doing it.

06:03.922 --> 06:07.158
So what I'm proposing is a two-day
only Scrote Squad season.

06:07.226 --> 06:09.261
Kind of like a full-on
48-hour scrote fest.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.129
Yeah, no holds barred for two days.
I'm in for that.

06:11.196 --> 06:11.963
I like it.

06:12.030 --> 06:12.797
You in?

06:12.865 --> 06:13.666
That's cool with me.

06:13.699 --> 06:14.699
What's up, fellas?

06:14.767 --> 06:17.335
The boys can swim again,
so Ruxin's ready to shoot.

06:19.037 --> 06:20.605
Ruxin, unnecessary.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.874
Well, that's great, but we
have some big news, too.

06:22.941 --> 06:24.376
Scrote Season's back, babe.

06:24.443 --> 06:25.443
No, no way.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.478
Absolutely not. I'm not playing.

06:26.545 --> 06:28.613
Oh, you don't have to, but we will.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.982
Look, my D and B's were doubtful,
then they got upgraded

06:31.049 --> 06:34.452
to questionable and now they're probable,
and I need them ready for game time.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.154
No, no, no, no. No, no!

06:36.221 --> 06:36.988
Hey, hey, hey.

06:37.055 --> 06:37.822
No scrote!

06:37.890 --> 06:38.990
Watch the table.

06:39.057 --> 06:39.991
Sorry I'm late, Ruxin.

06:40.058 --> 06:41.125
Busy day.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.193
What have you been doing?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.162
I took a shit in your backyard.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.163
What?

06:45.230 --> 06:46.164
Nothing.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.000
Wait, I thought that was my neighbor's
Great Dane shitting in my backyard.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.134
Oh, come on, be serious.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.170
A Great Dane doesn't eat that much gum.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.205
All right, well, I brought
you here for a reason.

06:54.273 --> 06:55.340
It's Scrote Season.

06:55.408 --> 06:57.975
Ah, man, you guys do
such fun stuff together.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.745
I want to hang out and, like, hit
each other in the dick and stuff.

07:00.813 --> 07:01.746
Well, it's not gonna happen.

07:01.814 --> 07:03.481
I'm trying to protect my balls, okay?

07:03.549 --> 07:04.549
I'm hoping that you can help me.

07:04.617 --> 07:05.383
Yes.

07:05.451 --> 07:06.884
I will be your ballsyguard.

07:06.952 --> 07:10.188
From now on, I'm Kevin Costner,
your balls are Whitney Houston.

07:10.255 --> 07:10.922
R.I.P.

07:10.989 --> 07:11.989
R.I.P. Whitney Houston?

07:12.057 --> 07:12.590
Yeah.

07:12.658 --> 07:13.525
Oh, my God!

07:13.592 --> 07:14.426
Whitney's dead?!

07:14.493 --> 07:15.059
Yeah.

07:15.127 --> 07:16.328
Oh!

07:16.395 --> 07:18.229
How's Michael Jackson taking it?

07:18.297 --> 07:21.700
Oh, buddy.

07:21.767 --> 07:26.338
Hey, can I get your cheapest
draft beer, please?

07:26.405 --> 07:29.106
Holy shit.

07:29.174 --> 07:29.907
Excuse me.

07:29.975 --> 07:30.542
Adrian Peterson?

07:30.609 --> 07:31.175
Yes.

07:31.243 --> 07:34.212
I just want to say, I'm a huge fan, and
I can't believe you're in Chicago.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.046
What are you doing here?

07:35.113 --> 07:37.549
It's my off day, so, uh, just
came to town to see my lady.

07:37.616 --> 07:38.616
Dating a Chicago girl, huh?

07:38.684 --> 07:40.452
Yeah, man, she's pretty special.

07:40.519 --> 07:41.085
Sweet lady.

07:41.153 --> 07:41.753
That's great.

07:41.821 --> 07:45.357
I just wanted to say, you single-handedly
have brought me to the Shiva Bowl.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.023
Shiva Bowl?

07:46.091 --> 07:46.924
What's-what's that?

07:46.992 --> 07:49.561
Oh, sorry, it's our league
fantasy football championship.

07:49.628 --> 07:50.588
What's your team's name?

07:50.629 --> 07:52.797
Well, I'm currently called
the 3-Petes, but if you have

07:52.865 --> 07:55.933
one more strong game, looks like
I'm gonna be the 4-Petes, you

07:56.001 --> 07:56.868
know what I'm saying?

07:56.935 --> 07:58.370
How about the 4-Petersons?

07:58.437 --> 07:58.970
Yes!

07:59.037 --> 07:59.604
I love that.

07:59.672 --> 08:00.238
Like that?

08:00.305 --> 08:00.938
And one last thing.

08:01.006 --> 08:02.807
Is it okay if I get a picture, too?

08:02.875 --> 08:03.708
Yeah, sure.

08:03.776 --> 08:04.576
Then we're done, right?

08:04.643 --> 08:05.209
Yes.

08:05.277 --> 08:05.810
Cool.

08:05.878 --> 08:06.718
Y-You're the coolest.

08:06.779 --> 08:07.779
It's cool. No problem.

08:07.847 --> 08:08.813
Okay.

08:08.881 --> 08:09.947
Man, you even smell good.

08:10.649 --> 08:11.483
Awkward, man.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.718
Say, "4-Pete!"

08:13.786 --> 08:14.952
Whoo...!

08:15.020 --> 08:16.287
Hey, baby.

08:16.355 --> 08:17.422
Hey, sweetie.

08:19.157 --> 08:20.091
Oh, hi, Pete.

08:20.158 --> 08:21.793
Gina, what the hell are you doing here?

08:21.861 --> 08:24.061
Oh, I'm Adrian's girlfriend.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.329
You're his girlfriend?

08:25.398 --> 08:27.098
His girlfriend.

08:27.165 --> 08:28.633
So you like this word now?

08:28.701 --> 08:30.167
Well, now it fits.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.770
So, how you know Gina, man?

08:31.837 --> 08:33.136
She used to be my girlfriend.

08:33.205 --> 08:34.105
Oh, nope.

08:34.172 --> 08:35.072
Sorry, we dated.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.441
Mm, mm-mm.

08:36.509 --> 08:37.140
We consorted.

08:37.208 --> 08:37.909
Ugh.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.244
It was a casual string of
hookups that I misinterpreted.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.813
Ah, pity sex.

08:41.881 --> 08:42.514
Yeah.

08:42.581 --> 08:44.115
Best pity sex you ever had.

08:44.182 --> 08:44.949
Boom.

08:45.017 --> 08:46.418
So, you're the most pitiful.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.420
Don't use my grammar against me, A.D.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.922
Nice meeting you, Pete, but
we're gonna get going, okay?

08:50.989 --> 08:51.656
Thank you.

08:51.724 --> 08:53.257
Hey, go 3-Pete, man.

08:53.325 --> 08:53.858
Yes.

08:53.926 --> 08:55.627
We're gonna go back to my place.

08:55.694 --> 08:57.295
We may even have a 4-Pete.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.164
Don't take away my 4-Pete.

09:00.232 --> 09:01.132
I'm about to.

09:01.199 --> 09:02.791
Later, bitch.

09:02.911 --> 09:05.249
I hope A.D. doesn't stand
for "Awesome Dong."

09:07.139 --> 09:08.172
Adrian Peterson?

09:08.240 --> 09:12.510
The very guy who made my fantasy
season is destroying my personal life.

09:12.577 --> 09:13.744
Wow. How does he look?

09:13.812 --> 09:14.945
She looks beautiful, man.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.080
No, no, no, I said "he."

09:16.148 --> 09:17.048
How does <i>he</i> look?

09:17.116 --> 09:18.182
He looks incredible.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.684
I mean, he's athletic, he's slim.

09:20.752 --> 09:22.353
His smile is even radiant.

09:22.421 --> 09:23.354
You know what?

09:23.422 --> 09:26.690
I-I used to love this guy, now I
don't even want to think about him.

09:26.758 --> 09:30.728
Your number one player is just destroying
your ex-girlfriend's backfield.

09:30.795 --> 09:33.564
Oh, they are just hooking up <i>all day!</i>

09:33.632 --> 09:34.465
<i>All day!</i>

09:34.533 --> 09:35.766
<i>A.D.! All day!</i>

09:35.834 --> 09:38.136
<i>I'm in the goddamn Shiva Bowl
and I can't even enjoy it.</i>

09:38.203 --> 09:39.803
<i>This should be the
happiest time of my life.</i>

09:39.871 --> 09:43.474
<i>Well, that is a testament to
how sad your life is, Pete.</i>

09:43.542 --> 09:44.375
<i>Scrote!</i>

09:44.443 --> 09:44.975
<i>Whoa!</i>

09:45.044 --> 09:45.809
<i>What the hell?!</i>

09:45.877 --> 09:46.744
<i>Nobody is safe!</i>

09:46.811 --> 09:48.146
<i>Scrote Squad!</i>

09:48.213 --> 09:48.913
<i>Balls!</i>

09:48.980 --> 09:50.148
<i>Boom! Whoo!</i>

09:51.116 --> 09:51.982
<i>Why is Rafi scroting?</i>

09:52.051 --> 09:52.950
<i>He's not on the Scrote Squad.</i>

09:53.018 --> 09:54.218
<i>Yes, what is he doing?</i>

09:54.286 --> 09:56.787
<i>Since you guys instituted
Scrote Season and wouldn't give</i>

09:56.855 --> 09:59.290
<i>me a hall pass, I had
to hire a ballsyguard.</i>

09:59.358 --> 10:00.124
<i>Okay, forget it.</i>

10:00.192 --> 10:00.958
<i>I'm shutting this down.</i>

10:01.026 --> 10:03.061
<i>I can tell him to stop,
but who knows if he will.</i>

10:03.128 --> 10:04.895
<i>I think the Rafi train
has left the station.</i>

10:04.963 --> 10:08.466
<i>And you, my friends, are
tied to the tracks.</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:13.604
<i>Protect Your Scrotes.</i>

10:13.672 --> 10:17.007
<i>And, uh, better find a place in
the house to keep The Sacko, Kev.</i>

10:17.076 --> 10:18.943
<i>Oh, that's one thing I'm
not worried about at all.</i>

10:19.010 --> 10:21.479
<i>I mean, I'm technically playing
you in The Sacko, but really</i>

10:21.547 --> 10:22.580
<i>you're playing yourself.</i>

10:22.647 --> 10:23.481
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

10:23.549 --> 10:25.683
<i>You'll tinker and you'll move
things around, then you'll make</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:26.317
<i>your mistake.</i>

10:26.385 --> 10:27.851
<i>Set it and forget it, my friends.</i>

10:27.919 --> 10:28.919
<i>I'm great at fantasy football.</i>

10:28.987 --> 10:30.754
<i>Yeah, 'cause you're in The Sacko, right?</i>

10:30.822 --> 10:31.489
<i>So are you.</i>

10:31.557 --> 10:32.358
<i>Well, see you there.</i>

10:32.424 --> 10:33.157
<i>Scrote Squad!</i>

10:33.225 --> 10:33.924
<i>Whoa!</i>

10:35.427 --> 10:36.026
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

10:36.095 --> 10:36.961
<i>What? You're next, Taco.</i>

10:37.028 --> 10:37.962
<i>Oh, no.</i>

10:38.029 --> 10:39.330
<i>Scrote Squad.</i>

10:39.398 --> 10:40.331
<i>Suicide Scrote!</i>

10:41.266 --> 10:41.966
<i>What?</i>

10:42.033 --> 10:43.334
<i>Can you do that?</i>

10:43.402 --> 10:44.302
<i>It still counts.</i>

10:44.369 --> 10:45.136
<i>Scrote Squad!</i>

10:45.204 --> 10:46.637
<i>Nobody's safe!</i>

10:46.705 --> 10:47.805
<i>You taking off soon?</i>

10:47.872 --> 10:49.006
<i>Yeah, I'm heading out. Why?</i>

10:49.074 --> 10:51.309
<i>Well, it's my last night
with Shiva, and I want to do</i>

10:51.376 --> 10:51.976
<i>something special.</i>

<i>What do I do about the flex?</i>

<i>Stevan Ridley or Kenny Britt?</i>

11:56.775 --> 11:58.108
<i>Kenny Britt.</i>

11:58.177 --> 11:59.510
<i>Uh, thank you, vodka.</i>

11:59.578 --> 12:03.781
<i>You've given me the confidence
to make a smart choice.</i>

12:04.650 --> 12:05.716
<i>Oh.</i>

12:05.784 --> 12:07.451
<i>Got to start the running back, right?</i>

12:07.519 --> 12:10.588
<i>Sorry, Kenny Britt, Ridley's my man.</i>

12:10.656 --> 12:11.955
<i>Ain't that right, vodka?</i>

12:12.023 --> 12:13.791
<i>Yes,
always start running back.</i>

12:13.858 --> 12:15.293
<i>What about Sidney Rice?</i>

12:15.360 --> 12:17.628
<i>Yes,

<i>Stevan Ridley, you're hiding on me.</i>

12:35.013 --> 12:37.815
<i>And I'm gonna find you with that eye.</i>

12:37.882 --> 12:40.884
<i>And the winner is... Kenny Britt.</i>

12:40.952 --> 12:43.120
<i>I wanted Sidney Rice!</i>

12:43.188 --> 12:45.055
<i>Eat fat ones, bowl!</i>

13:36.508 --> 13:37.141
<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Don't play with Daddy's computer.</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

<i>You're not gonna pull this off, Ruxin.</i>

13:55.193 --> 13:56.827
<i>You're gonna win The Sacko, buddy.</i>

13:56.895 --> 13:58.663
<i>And speaking of not pulling it off, Pete.</i>

13:58.730 --> 14:00.197
<i>Peterson had a monster week.</i>

14:00.265 --> 14:01.365
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

14:01.433 --> 14:02.400
<i>On your bench!</i>

14:02.467 --> 14:03.567
<i>How could you not play him?</i>

14:03.635 --> 14:07.405
<i>I could not enjoy this win if
I started Adrian Peterson.</i>

14:07.472 --> 14:09.573
<i>You could've just given him a
ceremonial slap on the wrist and</i>

14:09.641 --> 14:11.909
<i>put him in the flex position.</i>

14:11.976 --> 14:14.257
<i>No, I was not gonna give Gina
the satisfaction, all right?</i>

14:14.313 --> 14:16.079
<i>Gina's gotten plenty of satisfaction.</i>

14:16.147 --> 14:17.147
<i>Have you seen Adrian Peterson?</i>

14:17.215 --> 14:19.883
<i>That dude is plowing her like

<i>after a snowstorm.</i>

14:21.320 --> 14:23.354
<i>So, that it's it-- Ted wins the Shiva.</i>

14:23.422 --> 14:25.756
<i>Ted, the guy who doesn't show up
for draft, doesn't post on the</i>

<i>message boards.</i>

14:27.058 --> 14:28.258
<i>It's worse than having Taco win.</i>

14:28.327 --> 14:30.260
<i>The bigger question is what
do we do with The Shiva?</i>

14:30.329 --> 14:31.261
<i>I mean, do we send it to him?</i>

14:31.330 --> 14:33.497
<i>I could just hold on to
it till he gets back.</i>

14:33.565 --> 14:34.565
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

14:34.633 --> 14:36.500
<i>Whoa, whoa, check it out.</i>

14:36.568 --> 14:38.836
<i>Ted just posted on the message boards.</i>

14:43.942 --> 14:45.710
<i>I think he was overseas, right?</i>

14:45.777 --> 14:46.711
<i>What's going on? Yeah!</i>

14:46.778 --> 14:47.845
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

14:47.912 --> 14:51.281
<i>Oh, relax, Scrote Season's
over so your balls are safe.</i>

14:51.350 --> 14:52.850
<i>But watch your dicks.</i>

14:52.917 --> 14:54.117
<i>Look what I made.</i>

14:54.185 --> 14:56.587
<i>Hey, Geoffrey, is that a picture
of Daddy tinkering with</i>

14:56.655 --> 14:57.688
<i>his lineup?</i>

14:57.756 --> 15:00.057
<i>Hey, Geoffrey, next time draw a
picture of Daddy and The Sacko</i>

15:00.124 --> 15:01.625
<i>trophy behind you.</i>

15:01.693 --> 15:02.793
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

15:02.861 --> 15:06.597
<i>He can snuggle up in that bull
sack like a little sleeping bag.</i>

15:06.665 --> 15:08.131
<i>So cozy in this fur.</i>

15:09.701 --> 15:11.969
<i>No, uh-uh, no, no, enough.</i>

15:12.036 --> 15:13.036
<i>All right, no!</i>

15:13.104 --> 15:14.037
<i>I am not The Sacko.</i>

15:14.105 --> 15:16.139
<i>I didn't get to set my regular lineup.</i>

15:16.207 --> 15:18.242
<i>There is no regular lineup for you.</i>

15:18.309 --> 15:20.310
<i>You add/dropped, like,
six players last night.</i>

15:20.379 --> 15:21.479
<i>This is not my fault, okay?</i>

15:21.546 --> 15:24.382
<i>It was collusion between
Baby Geoffrey and vodka.</i>

15:24.449 --> 15:25.383
<i>I want The Sacko.</i>

15:25.450 --> 15:27.385
<i>You don't want The Sacko, I promise you!</i>

15:27.452 --> 15:29.453
<i>So cute, a father/son Sacko moment.</i>

15:29.521 --> 15:30.488
<i>I want The Sacko!</i>

15:30.555 --> 15:32.490
<i>The Sacko's for losers,
Ruxins are winners.</i>

15:32.557 --> 15:34.324
<i>Well, at least share it with him.</i>

15:34.393 --> 15:35.325
<i>It's the Ruxin Sacko!</i>

15:35.394 --> 15:36.660
<i>No, Baby Geoffrey, no!</i>

15:36.728 --> 15:37.661
<i>Dick punch!</i>

15:39.230 --> 15:40.983
<i>Just like I taught him.</i>

15:41.103 --> 15:43.470
<i>Now get back over here, Baby
Geoffrey and finish the job.</i>

15:43.590 --> 15:46.006
<i>I can taste the yogurt
all the way in my mouth.</i>

15:47.029 --> 15:48.843
How is your sack, Ruxin?

15:48.963 --> 15:49.896
It's back on the I.R.

15:49.964 --> 15:51.798
Baby Geoffrey LT'd my Theismann.

15:51.866 --> 15:52.799
Ooh.

15:52.867 --> 15:57.070
Acquaintances, friends of acquaintances,
welcome to Taco Corp's New Year's Eve

15:57.137 --> 15:58.171
extravaganza.

15:58.239 --> 16:00.206
I spent every last penny
I had on this party.

16:00.274 --> 16:02.843
The good news is the Taco Corp
books are finally balanced and

16:02.910 --> 16:05.545
the I.R.A. will not be
bugging me this year.

16:05.613 --> 16:08.482
Oh, which reminds me, the bar is
now a cash bar, and Kevin, can I

16:08.549 --> 16:09.716
borrow taxi money?

16:09.784 --> 16:10.717
Sure.

16:10.785 --> 16:11.852
Happy New Year.

16:11.919 --> 16:12.853
Happy New Year.

16:13.921 --> 16:15.255
Come on, guys, liven up.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.690
It's New Year's Eve.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.759
What good happened to any
of us this past year?

16:18.826 --> 16:20.827
I mean, you couldn't have a kid,
you got dumped, we have a kid

16:20.895 --> 16:23.730
that's got half a foreskin
like Kid 'n Play's haircut.

16:23.798 --> 16:24.731
Whose name is Chalupa.

16:24.799 --> 16:25.732
Chalupa Batman.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.734
Shiva called it from the beginning.

16:27.802 --> 16:30.670
She said, "This year will not
go well for any of you."

16:30.738 --> 16:31.671
She cast a curse.

16:31.739 --> 16:33.740
I'm not cursed-- my year's been great.

16:33.808 --> 16:35.742
Got a new apartment, got a great lady.

16:35.810 --> 16:36.576
Andre?

16:36.644 --> 16:37.878
Oh, there she is right now.

16:37.945 --> 16:40.280
I bid you adieu.

16:40.347 --> 16:44.083
Wow, speak of the devil
and Shiva appears.

16:44.151 --> 16:45.886
Who invited her?

16:45.953 --> 16:48.354
I did-- thought she could do
some of her witch doctor magic

16:48.423 --> 16:49.389
tricks for the guests.

16:49.457 --> 16:53.359
I think it's good that she's here
because now we can make amends.

16:53.428 --> 16:55.361
She wants her name and face off
of that trophy, and I'm not

16:55.430 --> 16:57.196
willing to give up that tradition.

16:57.264 --> 16:59.224
Maybe we should just drop
The Shiva and The Sacko.

16:59.266 --> 17:00.567
Uh, bullshit, no.

17:00.635 --> 17:03.937
Well, well, well-- look at
what we've got here, huh?

17:04.003 --> 17:07.272
Ruxin, you've got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.107
How so?

17:08.175 --> 17:10.143
Ever since my sleeper agent
Baby Geoffrey destroyed your

17:10.210 --> 17:12.145
baby maker, you've been replaced.

17:12.212 --> 17:14.981
It's time for you to walk into
the desert and die like a dog.

17:15.049 --> 17:18.318
I destroyed you using a
baby's fist as a weapon!

17:18.385 --> 17:19.953
Gattaca!

17:20.020 --> 17:21.621
Ooh, wow.

17:21.689 --> 17:22.955
So cool.

17:23.022 --> 17:24.790
What is Taco Corp anyway?

17:24.858 --> 17:27.928
Basically it's a dude who just gets
super baked and wears identical suits.

17:27.994 --> 17:30.096
Oh, are you excited about the new year?

17:30.164 --> 17:32.566
Very. I was thinking that maybe
we could start a family?

17:32.633 --> 17:33.567
Well, the new year's in 30

17:33.634 --> 17:34.400
minutes.

17:34.469 --> 17:37.236
Well, I guess we don't have to wait
till the waiting, but, you know...

17:37.304 --> 17:39.072
We don't have to wait till next year.

17:39.139 --> 17:40.073
Now?

17:40.140 --> 17:40.907
Mm-hmm.

17:40.975 --> 17:41.908
Here?

17:41.976 --> 17:42.909
Mm-hmm, <i>oui, oui, monsieur.</i>

17:42.977 --> 17:44.945
<i>Yeah, let's do it--
let's pull the goalie.</i>

17:45.012 --> 17:47.180
<i>I've had this dream of having
a bunch of little girls</i>

17:47.247 --> 17:48.348
<i>whose name start with T.</i>

17:48.415 --> 17:49.349
<i>Me, too-- three little girls.</i>

17:49.416 --> 17:54.588
<i>- Tina... Tammy... Toni...
- With an "I."</i>

17:54.655 --> 17:55.655
<i>Come on.</i>

17:55.723 --> 17:56.823
<i>Okay.</i>

17:56.891 --> 17:57.991
<i>How about in there?</i>

17:58.058 --> 17:58.992
<i>In the photo booth?</i>

17:59.059 --> 17:59.826
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:59.894 --> 18:02.095
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

18:02.162 --> 18:04.531
<i>This is gonna be great.</i>

18:05.232 --> 18:06.800
<i>Try to relax, try to relax.</i>

18:06.868 --> 18:08.267
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

18:08.335 --> 18:11.638
<i>Well, based on her symptoms,
she has seminal plasma</i>

18:11.706 --> 18:12.672
<i>hypersensitivity.</i>

18:12.740 --> 18:13.673
<i>W-What's that mean?</i>

18:13.741 --> 18:14.975
<i>She's allergic to your semen.</i>

18:15.042 --> 18:17.310
<i>No, no, no!</i>

18:17.378 --> 18:19.445
<i>Wait, what?</i>

18:19.514 --> 18:21.481
<i>Well, you know how some people
are allergic to peanuts.</i>

18:21.549 --> 18:23.016
<i>Your semen is her peanuts.</i>

18:23.083 --> 18:24.183
<i>So she has a nut allergy.</i>

18:24.251 --> 18:25.411
<i>No, no, no, this is not true.</i>

18:25.419 --> 18:26.352
<i>This is not true.</i>

18:26.420 --> 18:28.889
<i>After intercourse, your semen
caused her to have hives,</i>

18:28.956 --> 18:31.357
<i>swollen eyes, and for some
reason your throat closed up.</i>

18:31.425 --> 18:32.659
<i>Well, maybe this is why.</i>

18:32.727 --> 18:35.028
<i>Photo booth pictures showing
Andre putting the El Camino in a</i>

18:35.095 --> 18:36.029
<i>few different spots.</i>

18:36.096 --> 18:39.032
<i>Please give it... No, no, no,
that's for the hall of records.</i>

18:39.099 --> 18:41.167
<i>Just to be clear, if you
continue to have unprotected sex</i>

18:41.235 --> 18:42.903
<i>with her, she could die.</i>

18:42.970 --> 18:43.904
<i>What?</i>

18:43.971 --> 18:45.739
<i>We need to get your
fiance to the hospital.</i>

18:45.806 --> 18:48.141
<i>Oh, Tina, Tammy, Toni!</i>

18:48.208 --> 18:50.644
<i>Okay, this curse has to end.</i>

18:50.711 --> 18:52.913
<i>Whatever you have to do, do it.</i>

18:52.980 --> 18:54.848
<i>So, are we agreed?</i>

18:54.916 --> 18:57.197
<i>You know what-- all right, fine,
none of us won The Shiva,</i>

18:57.251 --> 18:59.485
<i>so let Ted call it whatever
the hell he wants.</i>

18:59.554 --> 19:00.486
<i>Great.</i>

19:00.555 --> 19:01.487
<i>I forgot my coat.</i>

19:01.556 --> 19:02.637
<i>Oh, Shiva, we need to talk.</i>

19:02.657 --> 19:04.591
<i>You're not gonna make out
with me again, are you?</i>

19:04.659 --> 19:05.659
<i>We want to apologize.</i>

19:05.726 --> 19:07.727
<i>And we would love if
you remove the curse.</i>

19:07.795 --> 19:08.562
<i>The what?</i>

19:08.629 --> 19:10.564
<i>The curse, the curse
you put on all of us.</i>

19:10.631 --> 19:12.566
<i>We'll take your name off our trophy.</i>

19:12.633 --> 19:13.567
<i>What about the car?</i>

19:13.634 --> 19:14.568
<i>The Shivamobile?</i>

19:14.635 --> 19:16.036
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

19:16.103 --> 19:17.037
<i>Pete.</i>

19:17.104 --> 19:19.039
<i>Fine, it's a piece of shit anyway.</i>

19:19.106 --> 19:20.106
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

19:20.174 --> 19:22.008
<i>No more Shiva on anything.</i>

19:22.076 --> 19:25.011
<i>We just want to start the year
fresh with you not hating us.</i>

19:25.079 --> 19:28.081
<i>All right, it takes too much effort
to be mad at you guys anyway.</i>

19:28.148 --> 19:29.916
<i>At midnight, you're off my shit list.</i>

19:29.984 --> 19:30.917
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:30.985 --> 19:31.751
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:31.819 --> 19:33.753
<i>So that's it-- the curse is lifted?</i>

19:33.821 --> 19:34.821
<i>I think we're curse-free.</i>

19:34.822 --> 19:35.589
<i>Cheers.</i>

19:35.656 --> 19:36.756
<i>Here's to a better year.</i>

19:36.824 --> 19:38.224
<i>And to Andre's toxic jizz.</i>

19:38.292 --> 19:41.895
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, on
behalf of us all at Taco Corp,</i>

19:41.963 --> 19:44.731
<i>we would like to thank you very
much for being here with us</i>

19:44.799 --> 19:45.799
<i>tonight.</i>

19:45.866 --> 19:48.401
<i>You are not just clients to us,
but nameless strangers with</i>

19:48.469 --> 19:49.603
<i>money as well.</i>

19:49.670 --> 19:53.974
<i>Now, the year 2013 is upon us and
I'd like to usher in the new</i>

19:54.041 --> 19:56.910
<i>year with Taco Corp's latest project.</i>

19:56.978 --> 19:59.079
<i>Behold!</i>

20:00.715 --> 20:03.817
<i>Let the countdown begin.</i>

20:03.884 --> 20:07.621
<i>79, 78... No, no.</i>

20:07.688 --> 20:10.556
<i>55... Taco, come on.</i>

20:10.625 --> 20:11.557
<i>20, is 20...?</i>

20:11.626 --> 20:12.558
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:12.627 --> 20:17.296
<i>Okay, 20... Second baby or no
second baby, I still love you.</i>

20:17.364 --> 20:19.398
<i>Well, considering Baby
Geoffrey used my nards as a</i>

20:19.466 --> 20:21.234
<i>speed bag, maybe one kid's enough.</i>

20:21.301 --> 20:22.235
<i>Happy New Year, babe.</i>

20:22.302 --> 20:23.236
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

20:23.303 --> 20:24.237
<i>How's that drink taste?</i>

20:24.304 --> 20:26.606
<i>Did you roofie my drink?</i>

20:26.674 --> 20:29.109
<i>Oh, I roofied, like, 40%
of the drinks here.</i>

20:29.176 --> 20:30.810
<i>It's a numbers game for me.</i>

20:30.878 --> 20:34.580
<i>12... Enough with the vuvuzelas,
Taco, this is New Year's Eve not</i>

20:34.649 --> 20:35.782
<i>a soccer game.</i>

20:35.850 --> 20:40.286
<i>Oh, no, no, no, these aren't just
any old vuvuzelas, my friend.</i>

20:42.589 --> 20:44.323
<i>Full steam ahead, boys!</i>

20:44.391 --> 20:48.161
<i>Nine, eight, blow!</i>

20:48.228 --> 20:49.328
<i>Blow!</i>

20:49.396 --> 20:50.596
<i>What's happening?</i>

20:50.665 --> 20:53.599
<i>Did I eat miso soup today?</i>

20:53.668 --> 20:54.333
<i>Lower, lower.</i>

20:55.569 --> 20:56.803
<i>Oh, God.</i>

20:56.871 --> 20:58.004
<i>Get to the note.</i>

20:58.072 --> 21:00.840
<i>Oh, no, Taco's taking us
downtown to Brown Town.</i>

21:00.908 --> 21:07.847
<i>Reach the note-- five,
four, three, two, one.</i>

21:07.915 --> 21:09.983
<i>The brown note!</i>

21:10.051 --> 21:11.217
<i>Yamagoya!</i>

21:11.285 --> 21:13.820
<i>Sometimes when I shit, I cum!</i>

21:13.888 --> 21:15.021
<i>It works!</i>

21:15.089 --> 21:17.023
<i>All right, look at me so I can finish!</i>

21:17.091 --> 21:18.024
<i>Look at him!</i>

21:18.092 --> 21:20.026
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

21:44.251 --> 21:45.982
<i>Thanks for the car, assholes.</i>

21:46.102 --> 21:47.467
Eat my dick!

21:50.023 --> 21:52.633
I'm gonna blast this trophy in the butt!
