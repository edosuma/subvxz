(explosion booms)

01:20.481 --> 01:23.217
(explosion booms)

01:23.251 --> 01:26.254
Head shots, decapitation, or
fire!

01:31.659 --> 01:34.528
(cannons booming)

01:44.638 --> 01:47.808
(girl wailing)

01:47.841 --> 01:49.510
Help!

01:49.543 --> 01:50.411
Please!

01:51.279 --> 01:52.146
Help!

01:52.946 --> 01:53.814
Please!

01:55.416 --> 01:56.550
Please!

01:56.584 --> 01:58.419
Please help my father.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.166
I cannot help him.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.402
It has been too long.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.470
He is beyond my reach now.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.371
I'm sorry.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.410
Take him to the pyre.

02:23.844 --> 02:24.712
Now.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.451
(sorrowful music)

02:38.359 --> 02:40.761
(Teela sighs)

02:43.264 --> 02:46.166
(Szorlok whispers)

02:53.441 --> 02:57.578
(Szorlok whispers)
(dramatic music)

02:58.912 --> 03:03.251
(corpse wheezes)
(bones cracking)

03:05.886 --> 03:08.622
(zombie hisses)

03:13.461 --> 03:15.463
(girl screams)

03:15.496 --> 03:17.765
(boy yells)

03:21.669 --> 03:24.538
(blood squelches)

03:25.506 --> 03:27.241
(Thane breathes heavily)

03:27.275 --> 03:28.776
I'm sorry.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.312
You have to believe me, he
was no longer your father.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.614
(girl sobs)

03:36.350 --> 03:38.752
Take him quickly to be burned.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.327
There's no end to it.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.597
How can we fight against all
this?

03:49.630 --> 03:53.334
Marek was a fool to take the
crown, why didn't you stop her?

03:53.367 --> 03:56.003
Mortals have been known
to see a way forward,

03:56.036 --> 03:59.039
even when the gods have no
answers to their prayers.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.041
So much dead already.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.710
Thane.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.945
We have our part to do.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.849
We must have faith that Marek
and Dagen will do theirs.

04:08.882 --> 04:09.750
Do you?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.020
Have faith in Marek?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.423
What other hope is there?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.826
(evil, bombastic music)
Hear me, gods!

04:18.858 --> 04:19.993
(thunder rumbles)

04:20.027 --> 04:23.431
Your power fades as your
worshipers die

04:24.565 --> 04:26.967
and rise again as my servants.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.039
This world is mine!
(thunder rumbles)

04:32.072 --> 04:35.809
All of you together
cannot stand against me.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.414
(chuckles)

04:43.651 --> 04:46.454
(dragon shrieks)

04:50.491 --> 04:53.327
- Come with me.
- We're coming.

04:53.361 --> 04:57.030
(children whispering)

04:57.064 --> 04:59.667
[Girl] It's Commander Thane.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.004
They look up to you.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.642
[Thane] They feel safe behind
the wall.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.079
(tender orchestral music)

05:22.089 --> 05:25.659
[General Rohgar] Commander
Thane.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
[Thane] Thank you, lad.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.698
(victim groaning)

05:30.731 --> 05:32.966
Tell me you bring good news.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.935
Every city they take,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.806
their armies increase tenfold.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.575
To keep fighting is madness.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.745
We must offer terms for our
surrender.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.048
Szorlok will show no mercy.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.050
To surrender is death.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.920
Your death, your people's death,

05:52.953 --> 05:55.423
perhaps even the death of the
gods.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.157
Let them die, then.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.927
They've done nothing to help us.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.699
[Ana-Sett] Do not
profane the gods, Thane.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.836
I have come to aid this world
at great peril to myself,

06:08.869 --> 06:11.772
just as Tek, God of the Forge,
once did.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.642
And he paid an ultimate price.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.445
Do not take our death lightly.

06:17.478 --> 06:21.615
If we immortals die, much that
is precious will die with us.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.018
Then call them down to fight
for us.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.219
Maybe then we'd have a chance.

06:26.253 --> 06:30.624
[Teela] They will not, they
all fear the fate of Tek.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.494
Then we cannot win.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.469
We must give them more time.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.671
Them, Commander?

06:43.704 --> 06:47.708
Send a horse to find Dagen and
Marek.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.077
Tell them to make haste.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.812
Tell them

06:51.845 --> 06:54.482
they're our only hope.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.618
(stream splashing)

06:57.651 --> 07:00.721
(deep, somber music)

07:13.934 --> 07:15.636
Come to me, Marek.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.739
(Marek gasps)

07:18.772 --> 07:20.741
You can save them.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.109
[Dagen] Hey!

07:22.142 --> 07:24.478
Did you have a good sleep?

07:27.881 --> 07:31.151
It's nice to be back in
civilized lands.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.956
It's colder than it should be.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.528
Say what you will about the
Admiral,

07:40.561 --> 07:43.497
but her clothes suit you
perfectly.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.766
Something wrong?

07:47.100 --> 07:47.968
Nothing.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.615
I can't work it out in
my head, why I did it.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.117
This crown for the Darkspore...

08:05.218 --> 08:08.756
I mean, I know why I did
it, but now that it's done,

08:08.789 --> 08:13.026
I can't help feeling like
I've made a terrible mistake.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.062
People are dying, Dagen.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.566
It's my fault.
No.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.835
No, hey, do not look back.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.237
Stick to the plan.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.942
By nightfall, we'll be at
Hammerhead's,

08:28.976 --> 08:31.812
we'll get Tek's Hammer and
we'll destroy the Darkspore,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.179
once and for all.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.650
I'd rather have that crown

08:37.684 --> 08:40.754
than that cursed black stone any
day.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.333
Szorlok said my mother
carried the Darkspore

08:53.366 --> 08:55.168
before I was born.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.905
He'd say anything to get to
you, Marek.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.139
Don't let him.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.911
I don't remember
anything about my mother.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.947
For as long as I can remember,
I was raised as an orphan

09:06.980 --> 09:08.882
in the slave camps.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.684
Until I was old enough, maybe 10
years,

09:10.718 --> 09:13.120
when I was sold to the
apothecary.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.056
Well, then he could say
anything about your mother

09:16.089 --> 09:17.124
and you would never know whether
or not...

09:17.157 --> 09:19.660
But what if it's true?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.029
What if he did know her?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.232
What if she did carry the
Darkspore?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.635
It could explain what I am.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.873
(sighs) Don't you ever think
about where you came from?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.977
(birds cawing)
Me?

09:38.145 --> 09:41.048
(aching, emotional music)

09:41.081 --> 09:43.951
I was born in a whorehouse,
Marek.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.786
It's fitting, I know.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.189
My mother was an elf.

09:49.222 --> 09:53.260
She was captured by orcish
slavers and sold to the brothel

09:53.293 --> 09:56.830
servicing the King's fifth army
regulars.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.735
Father was some sort of man, I
suppose.

10:03.403 --> 10:07.274
Probably a soldier, maybe
a passing tradesman.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.813
Some creep with an
appetite for pointed ears.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.048
Enough gold to satisfy her.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.953
When I was four years old,

10:21.855 --> 10:25.258
I found my mother hanging from a
doorpost.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.163
She'd taken her own life, you
see.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.102
And after that,

10:37.337 --> 10:39.339
I had a dozen mothers, you might
say.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.240
Or none.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.883
I took to thieving like a baby
to bosom.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.120
Lots of passing gentlemen
with heavy purses.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.188
"Can't blame the kid, he's just
a kid."

10:55.222 --> 10:57.858
(chuckles)

10:57.891 --> 10:59.760
So they'd beat me.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.763
Sometimes 'til I couldn't stand.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.798
Until I escaped the brothel,
to make my own fortune

11:04.832 --> 11:05.899
in the world.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.338
But the money came and the money
went,

11:11.371 --> 11:15.008
as quickly as I could
steal it and spend it.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.310
There's not a lot to be proud
of.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.448
My life had a lot of people,
(chuckles) that's my legacy.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.955
(sighs) I'm a thief, Marek.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.256
That's all I am.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.966
(Marek sighs)

11:38.999 --> 11:42.202
You're a thief and I'm a
necromancer.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.806
We both lost what little
we had to call mothers

11:45.839 --> 11:47.707
far too young in life.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.277
Both of us cursed from the
start.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.178
No.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.214
No, don't you see, it's...

11:56.817 --> 12:00.387
You found me because you needed
a thief.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.523
I owe everything I have to that.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.158
You, Thane, Teela.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.964
I wouldn't trade that for
anything.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.033
It doesn't matter where we came
from;

12:13.066 --> 12:14.334
we're here, now.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.206
Right when the world needs us.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.777
When I was a slave,
that's all I ever wanted.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.412
To choose for myself.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.349
But I never wanted tot
choose for the whole world.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.852
(Dagen chuckles)

12:31.885 --> 12:36.089
Careful what you wish
for, as the saying goes.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.390
Hey.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.291
I'm sorry.

12:43.196 --> 12:46.133
We just have to do our part,
now.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.567
Soon, we can forget about all
this;

12:47.600 --> 12:51.271
let somebody else save
this wretched world.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.075
(girl screaming)

12:58.245 --> 13:00.513
(zombies snarling)

13:00.547 --> 13:03.016
(dramatic, panicky music)

13:03.050 --> 13:05.252
Run for your life!

13:05.285 --> 13:08.221
(people screaming)

13:29.409 --> 13:30.844
I can't find her!

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
[Peasant Man] Ivy!

13:32.579 --> 13:33.413
Ivy!

13:33.446 --> 13:34.948
Mama!

13:34.982 --> 13:35.682
Mama!

13:35.715 --> 13:36.616
(arrow whooshes)
(girl shrieks)

13:36.649 --> 13:38.318
Nice shot, Dagen.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.588
[Peasant Woman] Ivy!

13:43.123 --> 13:44.424
(zombie snarls)

13:44.457 --> 13:46.459
Get them to the wagon.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.034
(zombies snarling)

13:56.069 --> 13:58.972
(magic fizzes)

13:59.006 --> 14:01.541
(zombies groan)

14:11.151 --> 14:12.619
(people yelling)

14:12.652 --> 14:13.921
Wait! Stop!

14:16.189 --> 14:17.290
Hey, stop! Stop!

14:17.324 --> 14:19.259
Get in the wagon! Get inside!

14:19.292 --> 14:20.593
Go, go!

14:20.627 --> 14:21.561
Get inside!

14:22.629 --> 14:26.133
(zombies snarling)

14:26.166 --> 14:27.534
Go!

14:27.567 --> 14:29.136
(girl screams)

14:29.169 --> 14:31.638
Never mind her, you get inside!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.309
(zombies snarling)

14:36.343 --> 14:37.210
Go.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.282
You don't let anyone through
those doors.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.352
(arrow whooshes)

14:45.385 --> 14:47.921
(kick thuds)

14:50.657 --> 14:54.995
(zombies roaring)
(cart bangs)

14:56.363 --> 14:58.966
(Marek yells)

15:02.669 --> 15:06.339
(frantic orchestral music)

15:11.044 --> 15:13.646
(woman whimpers)

15:29.062 --> 15:30.230
(latch rattles)

15:30.263 --> 15:32.599
(women yelp)

15:38.205 --> 15:41.208
(latch clacks)

15:41.241 --> 15:42.609
Is everyone cozy?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.378
(cart thumping)

15:51.218 --> 15:52.986
Everyone down on the floor!

15:53.020 --> 15:54.454
Get on the floor!

15:54.487 --> 15:58.091
This should do the trick.
(fuses hiss)

15:58.125 --> 16:00.593
(girl shrieks)

16:01.628 --> 16:04.297
(woman crying)

16:13.206 --> 16:14.141
(Marek yells)

16:14.174 --> 16:17.044
(explosion booms)

16:18.111 --> 16:20.513
(Marek pants)

16:26.753 --> 16:28.155
(Dagen coughs)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.390
[Marek] All clear.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.291
Right.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.999
I see my quick thinking did the
trick.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.669
You can come out now.
(wood thuds)

16:42.702 --> 16:43.770
We saved you.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.241
Come on.

16:49.409 --> 16:53.546
If anyone asks, we're the
Redthorns, renowned heroes.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.483
You must carry us to safety.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.585
We're headed back the way you
came.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.719
It's not safe.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.722
Opposite direction, actually,
so best be on your way.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.125
Alone, we will die!

17:05.157 --> 17:09.396
Even one of those monsters
is more than we can handle.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.430
Look at us!

17:10.463 --> 17:11.498
Have mercy.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.500
Listen, you don't understand.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.202
We don't have time.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.472
I'm not leaving this wagon.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.707
Yes, you are.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.277
Marek, turn them into toads.
(peasant gasps)

17:24.310 --> 17:25.178
Dagen.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.150
Yes?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.086
We have room in the wagon.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.422
Oh, don't fool yourself,
these people are dead weight.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.190
They won't make it
alone, you know they won't.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.858
And if they slow us down?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.428
Then we all die, them too.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.562
There are children here.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.830
How many other children are
there?

17:43.863 --> 17:45.398
How many other peasants?

17:45.432 --> 17:47.700
We can't let them distract us.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.569
Let's get them somewhere safe,
or safer.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.537
- Where?
- Away from here.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.404
Where, Marek?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.306
There is nowhere safe!

17:55.408 --> 17:58.611
Then we'll give them the wagon
and we'll continue on foot.

17:58.645 --> 18:03.116
(chuckles) Oh no, we will not.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.418
I'm not leaving Zombie Girl.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.588
This girl isn't well.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.791
She can't keep up.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.263
I need you to look after her.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.366
Hey.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.234
Excuse me (chuckles).

18:21.268 --> 18:24.437
When all this is over and
I come looking for her,

18:24.471 --> 18:28.241
if anything has happened
to her, and I mean,

18:28.275 --> 18:32.145
if she is any worse off
than she is right now,

18:33.380 --> 18:36.316
I will kill you before
you can wet yourself.

18:36.349 --> 18:40.487
You getting that through your
big, thick, round head bone?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.189
I'll take care of her.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.055
I swear it.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.924
Mm-hmm, you're damn right, you
will.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.493
Hey.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.627
Hey.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.398
This skinny, ugly man is
going to take care of you now.

18:51.431 --> 18:55.502
If he doesn't, don't
hesitate to rip him in half.

18:58.271 --> 19:01.674
(uncertain, uneasy music)

19:19.259 --> 19:21.794
I cannot believe you gave away
our wool.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.296
Enough, Dagen.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.306
(moves into sinister music)

19:33.340 --> 19:34.674
What have I done?

19:42.014 --> 19:45.885
(chilling, suspenseful music)

20:13.380 --> 20:16.616
(weapon whirs)

20:16.649 --> 20:19.719
(Hammerhead pants)

20:19.752 --> 20:21.020
It's you.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.589
(groans)

20:22.622 --> 20:23.690
Hammerhead!

20:30.497 --> 20:31.631
Are you hurt?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.500
What happened?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.602
Szorlok's army.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.272
Golgotians swept through
the city like the wind.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.607
Nothing survived.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.010
(groans) Leave it.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.845
I'm dead already.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.647
Don't talk like that.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.716
Do you have it?

20:49.749 --> 20:50.883
The Darkspore?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.553
I traded it.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.054
(Hammerhead laughs)

20:55.087 --> 20:56.656
Dead.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.291
We're dead.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
We're all dead.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.363
But you wanted the crown for
yourself.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.433
Of course I wanted the crown.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.036
I was going to be the King
of the Dwarves (grunts).

21:10.069 --> 21:14.407
But that's all pipe's ash now
(groans).

21:17.477 --> 21:20.012
(coughs)

21:20.046 --> 21:21.748
But the Hammer of Tek, we can
use it

21:21.781 --> 21:24.584
to destroy the Darkspore once
and for all.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.053
The Hammer is gone.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.657
It's where only the dead can be.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.327
Don't waste your last few hours
on that.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.830
There's a young fellow right
there, show him a good time.

21:37.864 --> 21:41.067
(laughs) You don't need to
dance.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.836
Tek took the Hammer to the
Underworld.

21:43.870 --> 21:47.073
There must be a gateway,
a portal, something.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.775
He found a way in.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.843
Tek was a god.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.346
Who knows how he found his way
there?

21:53.380 --> 21:55.582
(breathes heavily)

21:55.615 --> 21:57.684
(groans)

21:57.717 --> 21:58.985
Curse you, girl.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.454
Not until I'm done.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.790
Where is the Underworld?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.892
Pox on you, foul wench!

22:07.627 --> 22:11.764
(sighs) The Underworld,
it's here, it's me.

22:12.865 --> 22:16.035
It'll be you soon enough too,
girl.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.005
It's the realm of the dead,

22:19.038 --> 22:22.742
if you believe in that sort of
thing.

22:22.775 --> 22:26.746
Where the spirits convene,
all freshly murdered,

22:27.980 --> 22:31.384
hunting this foul, bloody tomb.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.352
Where are the bodies?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.788
There's no corpses.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.959
(sighs) The corpses.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.396
They've up and gone to maim and
murder.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.666
One by one, up they stood,

22:48.668 --> 22:51.170
to slay their mates what
sat with them as brothers

22:51.203 --> 22:53.540
only moments before.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.643
Come back to life to kill each
other.

22:57.710 --> 23:01.648
Once I fought my share,
and so my end was sure,

23:02.549 --> 23:04.751
I hid myself in the larder.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.789
I only came out to see you two
sneaking in

23:09.822 --> 23:12.158
to torment what's left of me.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.396
Battlegrave.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.669
There must be a way into the
Underworld at Battlegrave.

23:22.702 --> 23:27.540
Well, you can die, that's
one sure way to the Underworld.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.578
You can go there now, for
all I care (chuckles).

23:31.611 --> 23:33.680
(groans)

23:35.181 --> 23:37.850
You're just like your mother.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.818
Relentless.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.522
You knew my mother?

23:42.555 --> 23:45.057
(sighs) Forget about it.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.227
There's nothing but pain there.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.128
Tell me.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.432
There once was a woman,

23:54.601 --> 23:57.537
a gypsy woman of low reputation,

23:57.570 --> 23:59.772
with hair as black as coal,

24:01.073 --> 24:05.211
a belly stretched out from
the baby what was inside her,

24:06.946 --> 24:09.882
looking for a dark hole to hide
in.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.788
Fool that I was, I hid
her in the wine cellar.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.026
Fed her scraps from the kitchen.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.495
There she was, alone.

24:22.529 --> 24:26.198
Day after day, night
after night, in the dark.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.170
'Til one morning,

24:32.404 --> 24:36.643
I came down and heard a wee
baby screaming her lungs out.

24:37.644 --> 24:38.745
(baby cries faintly)

24:38.778 --> 24:43.015
Still attached, her mother
cold and dead on the floor

24:44.617 --> 24:48.988
with a dark shard of crystal
hung about her neck on a chain.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.957
That was her secret.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.661
The shard, I sold to a ship's
pirate

24:54.694 --> 24:58.765
what called himself the Admiral
(groans),

24:58.798 --> 25:02.935
and the wee screaming baby,
I sold to the slavers.

25:06.072 --> 25:10.209
Didn't think I'd be seeing
you again so soon (laughs).

25:15.081 --> 25:16.282
Who named me?

25:17.817 --> 25:18.951
Marek.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.787
It's a Dwarfish word.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.222
A blacksmith term.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.758
Means crooked.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.630
Like when you finish the perfect
blade,

25:30.663 --> 25:32.999
then you look closer and see
that there's something about it

25:33.032 --> 25:34.967
that's not quite right.

25:36.235 --> 25:39.639
On account of your twisted
little foot.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.109
When we first met,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.245
did you know it was me?

25:47.780 --> 25:50.683
(Hammerhead sighs)

25:50.717 --> 25:54.186
You're the spitting
image of your mother.

25:54.220 --> 25:58.324
I figured Gojun Pye would tell
you when you were old enough.

26:00.192 --> 26:04.096
He came that morning to
look after your mother.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.934
Took her away to bury her.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.903
But he didn't take me.

26:10.937 --> 26:11.871
He left me.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.575
I had already sold you by
then.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.650
But he looked after you...
Enough.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.918
I've heard enough.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.253
We need to go now.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.888
To Battlegrave.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.789
(Hammerhead groans)

26:29.822 --> 26:31.290
Do you know what that is,
Battlegrave?

26:31.323 --> 26:32.191
No.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.627
I don't know.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.098
Which means probably no
one else does, either.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.200
You'll have to look in the
archive.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.368
The archive?

26:43.936 --> 26:46.072
Under the Thieves Guild.

26:47.206 --> 26:50.076
(breathes laboriously)

26:50.109 --> 26:51.343
Wait.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.712
Do me a favor.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.014
Burn my body.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.317
I don't want to turn

27:00.119 --> 27:00.987
you know.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.791
(gasping)

27:18.204 --> 27:19.338
All my life...

27:34.787 --> 27:37.256
(metal clangs)

28:17.163 --> 28:20.199
(door creaks faintly)

28:20.232 --> 28:22.769
(baby cries)

28:41.187 --> 28:43.923
(ominous music)

28:44.991 --> 28:47.493
Why do they not attack?

28:47.526 --> 28:51.397
They're waiting for
the main force to arrive.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.300
Countless thousands of them.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.803
[Teela] Is there any hope?

28:57.536 --> 29:02.374
It would be like hands
holding back a raging river.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.410
Szorlok isn't with them.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.479
I hope Marek is alright.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.918
For all our sakes.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.128
[Szorlok] Marek.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.240
There is no use resisting.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.542
We are meant to be together.

29:39.912 --> 29:40.779
Why?

29:42.181 --> 29:45.051
You have the Darkspore, what
more do you want from me?

29:45.084 --> 29:49.188
You are to me like an
arrow, crafted to perfection.

29:50.089 --> 29:54.226
Sharper than any sword,
faster than lightning.

29:54.260 --> 29:58.397
Forged with one purpose:
to slay the mightiest foe.

30:00.099 --> 30:04.236
My dear, I wish more than
anything to see that arrow fly.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.374
You won't be surprised,
then, when I fly at you.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.945
I alone can help you
reach your true potential.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.081
You want to help me?

30:15.114 --> 30:17.116
Then get out of my head.

30:18.384 --> 30:22.488
(monster hisses)
(Marek gasps)

30:29.195 --> 30:32.932
(delicate orchestral music)

30:54.653 --> 30:57.589
I used to come this way to
Gojun's.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.495
The whole city,

31:05.564 --> 31:07.366
there's nothing left.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.256
(wood clatters)

31:31.523 --> 31:35.527
(moves into tense, eerie music)

31:38.998 --> 31:41.167
[Dagen] I think you're
mistaken.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.269
This place is a death trap.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.104
Where are these archives?

31:45.137 --> 31:46.705
The catacombs.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.275
Below the Thieves Guild.
(zombie growls)

31:49.308 --> 31:51.610
It's a vault of sorts,
with records and artifacts

31:51.643 --> 31:54.513
from before the Vitalion
invasion.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.949
Lead the way.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.290
(Dagen blows air)

32:22.308 --> 32:23.209
Light it.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.347
(Marek whispers)

32:36.555 --> 32:38.490
There's an access,

32:38.524 --> 32:40.459
it should get us close.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.231
Hello?
Shh!

32:49.468 --> 32:53.472
(Marek speaks foreign language)

33:08.454 --> 33:10.622
Thieves use this network

33:10.656 --> 33:12.591
of sewers and catacombs

33:14.093 --> 33:17.229
to travel the city unnoticed.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.998
I've used it myself a few times.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.099
Which way?

33:53.132 --> 33:55.734
(monster growls)

33:58.670 --> 34:00.072
Not that way.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.808
Maybe we should split up.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.476
Hey, are you mad?

34:46.452 --> 34:48.320
[Marek] Are we lost?

34:49.655 --> 34:50.522
No.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.562
No, elves have an excellent
sense of direction.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.463
Though,

34:59.465 --> 35:01.733
perhaps less so underground.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.208
Back the way we came.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.488
The archives wouldn't
be far from the Guild,

35:22.521 --> 35:25.891
and were probably well guarded
when the city was overrun.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.494
So I'm looking for the darkest
bloodstains

35:28.527 --> 35:30.829
which would have tracked away
after the fallen soldiers

35:30.862 --> 35:32.531
rose from the dead.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.275
(uneasy, foreboding music)

35:43.309 --> 35:44.843
And now we're following those
tracks

35:44.876 --> 35:48.547
back down to where the
battle would have...

35:51.750 --> 35:52.818
Impressive.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.422
Sadly, however,

35:56.455 --> 35:58.324
it appears as if this is
where your powers of deduction

35:58.357 --> 36:00.426
are no longer of any use.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.829
Step aside, my lady.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.464
Stand and observe.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.970
It takes years of experience,

36:12.003 --> 36:13.905
refined sense, a very deep
understanding

36:13.939 --> 36:15.607
of all the moving parts, you
have to...

36:15.641 --> 36:16.775
How long is this going to
take?

36:16.808 --> 36:17.943
[Dagen] Shh.

36:26.585 --> 36:30.188
Sometimes it's best not to
overthink it.

36:32.491 --> 36:36.362
(awe-filled orchestral music)

36:41.433 --> 36:44.303
[Dagen] Someone left in a
hurry.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.507
All these works were said to
be lost.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.743
The Vitalions burned everything
when they conquered Deira.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.412
Yes, well.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.546
You can always trust the Thieves
Guild

36:54.580 --> 36:56.415
to keep something hidden.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.318
We don't give up treasure
lightly.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.794
So much to learn.

37:08.827 --> 37:09.795
Well,

37:09.828 --> 37:13.899
unless you want to eat
paper and drink hot wax,

37:13.932 --> 37:15.467
let's learn what we can about
Battlegrave

37:15.501 --> 37:16.568
and be on our

37:17.603 --> 37:18.904
way.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.607
(music swells)

37:26.578 --> 37:28.847
This is Guildmaster leather.

37:30.416 --> 37:34.353
This is light as silk
and strong as chain mail.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.994
And this sword.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.933
So perfectly balanced.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.909
These histories are too
recent.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.513
Centuries after the
death of the Lich King.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.482
I need ancient records.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.387
Before the Deirens even crossed
the seas.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.423
[Dagen] Fit perfectly, as if,

38:11.457 --> 38:13.592
as if crafted just for me.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.778
"And the rise of Amuhn-Kah."

38:33.879 --> 38:34.880
Dagen, look.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.817
It's in the Old Tongue.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.721
It tells of the rise of the Lich
King.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.423
[Dagen] The Darkspore.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.958
"The gods have no ears."

38:46.992 --> 38:49.695
"They are deaf to the
prayers of the people."

38:49.728 --> 38:53.699
(chuckles) Yeah, that's
how I've always seen it.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.402
"Only the God of the Forge
took pity

38:56.435 --> 39:00.872
"and, minu-mesa," I think
that means fell from Heaven,

39:00.906 --> 39:02.841
"to face the Lich King."

39:07.178 --> 39:10.916
"The power of death
overcame the gods that day."

39:10.949 --> 39:14.420
"In the Valley of Rath,
the mighty God of the Forge"

39:14.453 --> 39:16.922
"passed on to the World Below."

39:18.924 --> 39:20.792
That's the Underworld.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.930
"In the shadow of Warspire,
on the dust fields

39:24.963 --> 39:28.634
of Battlegrave..."
Battlegrave, that's it.

39:29.635 --> 39:32.070
In the Valley of Rath.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.140
Find me a map of the Southern
Realms.

39:36.074 --> 39:40.378
There must be an entrance to
the Underworld at Battlegrave.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.151
"The gods, in their anger at
the death of one of their own"

39:46.184 --> 39:50.656
"struck swiftly to split the
Lich King's heart asunder,"

39:50.689 --> 39:53.859
"returning the armies
of dead to the ground"

39:53.892 --> 39:55.894
"from whence they came."

39:55.927 --> 39:57.162
Here.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.063
This is Southern Realms,

39:58.096 --> 40:00.832
but there's nothing about
Battlegrave.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.067
No, but look.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.037
The Valley of Skulls, and
Warspire.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.808
When did my little
slave girl get so br...

40:13.144 --> 40:14.546
Just brilliant.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.624
I'm taking this with us.

40:25.657 --> 40:28.927
There may be more in
here about the Underworld

40:28.960 --> 40:31.463
and how to get there apart from
dying.

40:31.497 --> 40:33.565
Take it with us.

40:33.599 --> 40:34.466
Good idea.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.505
(exciting orchestral music)

40:39.538 --> 40:42.107
(zombie roaring)

40:44.710 --> 40:46.177
(metal clatters)

40:46.211 --> 40:49.014
(flame whooshes)

41:04.763 --> 41:06.498
(Dagen yells)

41:06.532 --> 41:09.467
(zombies snarling)

41:10.969 --> 41:12.904
Marek, we need to move!

41:14.305 --> 41:17.175
(blood squelches)

41:27.285 --> 41:29.855
(Dagen yells)

41:59.317 --> 42:00.185
Marek!

42:17.636 --> 42:18.269
(zombie snarls)

42:18.303 --> 42:21.039
(Marek screams)

42:28.780 --> 42:31.249
(magic fizzes)

42:32.117 --> 42:35.053
(zombies snarling)

42:42.828 --> 42:43.662
No!

42:44.763 --> 42:46.131
Back, back, back!

42:46.164 --> 42:49.901
Follow the water down,
it always leads down!

42:51.136 --> 42:54.072
(zombies snarling)

43:06.384 --> 43:08.787
[Marek] Dagen, over here.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.703
(Dagen yelling)

43:26.404 --> 43:30.008
[Dagen] They have me, they
have my foot!

43:32.377 --> 43:33.244
My foot!

43:39.951 --> 43:42.220
[Marek] Give me the torch!

44:13.351 --> 44:17.188
(despairing orchestral music)

44:21.860 --> 44:26.698
We gather for one last
stand, here on the wall.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.033
To what end?

44:28.066 --> 44:30.368
It will be a massacre.

44:30.401 --> 44:33.438
Szorlok's army is five days
away.

44:33.471 --> 44:36.107
They march day and night.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.209
Neither sleep nor eat.

44:38.243 --> 44:41.379
If we gather to one
place, we will be destroyed.

44:41.412 --> 44:45.316
At least spread out, he will
have to divide his forces.

44:45.350 --> 44:48.754
Our people can hide in hills and
caves.

44:52.090 --> 44:52.958
Sir.

44:55.827 --> 44:59.798
There's no hope in
putting off the inevitable.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.500
Gathering together in one
place will buy us time.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.002
Time for what?

45:05.203 --> 45:07.005
What hope do we have?

45:27.258 --> 45:28.860
[Szorlok] Marek.

45:33.932 --> 45:36.201
What do you want from me?

45:36.234 --> 45:38.770
[Szorlok] I need your help.

45:39.938 --> 45:42.340
You've already won.

45:42.373 --> 45:46.044
The world is on its knees,
what more could you want?

45:46.077 --> 45:48.546
[Szorlok] You think
I want all this death?

45:48.579 --> 45:51.416
This suffering for nothing?

45:51.449 --> 45:53.418
I am not a monster.

45:53.451 --> 45:54.385
Then why?

45:55.987 --> 45:59.557
Because the time of
the gods has finished.

45:59.590 --> 46:03.394
Their power fades while
their worshipers die.

46:04.830 --> 46:08.466
When they're weak enough,
I will overthrow them.

46:08.499 --> 46:10.068
You'll massacre everyone
just to turn around

46:10.101 --> 46:12.103
and murder the gods?

46:12.137 --> 46:15.573
With you at my side, Marek,
the gods could not withstand

46:15.606 --> 46:17.342
our powers combined.

46:20.611 --> 46:22.848
I won't help you.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.149
[Dagen] Marek!

46:26.184 --> 46:29.487
Then the slaughter must
continue.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.390
Their lives are in your hands
now.

46:39.097 --> 46:40.365
[Dagen] Marek!

46:46.571 --> 46:48.339
Why didn't you answer me?

46:48.373 --> 46:50.441
[Marek] I just needed a
moment.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.878
[Dagen] If something's wrong,
you can tell me anything.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.312
I said I'm fine.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.885
[Messenger] Below the fire.

47:03.989 --> 47:05.123
Who are you?

47:06.124 --> 47:09.527
A messenger from Commander
Thane.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.263
(chuckles) Commander Thane.

47:12.297 --> 47:16.401
I seek the wizard Marek,
and her half-elf companion,

47:16.434 --> 47:18.036
the bastard Dagen.

47:21.006 --> 47:22.407
Seems I'm in luck.

47:23.408 --> 47:26.577
Szorlok's armies are
three days' march, now,

47:26.611 --> 47:29.414
from our collective forces,
and when they arrive,

47:29.447 --> 47:33.318
they will wash over us
like waves on the sand.

47:36.254 --> 47:39.390
We're 30 leagues from
Battlegrave.

47:39.424 --> 47:41.026
That's three days.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.362
If we had a wagon...

47:44.395 --> 47:46.464
My horse is finished.

47:46.497 --> 47:49.034
And I have few provisions.

47:49.067 --> 47:53.138
I fear I am of no use,
other than of bad tidings.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.877
But of course, you'd do
anything in your power to help
us?

48:01.346 --> 48:02.347
Of course.

48:04.682 --> 48:06.617
Those are nice boots.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.525
We have sent riders and
carrier pigeons

48:14.559 --> 48:17.462
to every outpost in the realm.

48:17.495 --> 48:21.166
People are coming, leaving the
land empty.

48:21.199 --> 48:24.302
Bringing with them whatever
they can carry on their backs.

48:24.335 --> 48:25.370
Good.

48:25.403 --> 48:29.607
Good, less bodies for
Szorlok's army to possess.

48:38.483 --> 48:42.087
Remind me why we're doing this
again?

48:42.120 --> 48:44.289
'Cause we're the only ones who
can.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.491
I can't help but feeling
that's less of a reason

48:46.524 --> 48:48.393
and more of an excuse.

48:50.228 --> 48:51.096
You know,

48:52.097 --> 48:55.633
we could just abandon
this ill-fated quest.

48:58.069 --> 49:00.271
Go live out by the sea,

49:00.305 --> 49:01.639
a nice, warm sun.

49:03.508 --> 49:07.478
I could fish, and you
could do the washing.

49:07.512 --> 49:09.080
Look, I, hey,

49:09.114 --> 49:10.681
I could wash as well.

49:12.683 --> 49:14.619
And have little quarter-elf
babies

49:14.652 --> 49:18.389
with ever-so-slightly pointed
ears.

49:18.423 --> 49:20.225
Huh, what do you say?

49:21.726 --> 49:24.295
- Sounds lovely.
- Yeah?

49:24.329 --> 49:25.730
But it's not me.

49:31.069 --> 49:32.670
Szorlok speaks to me.

49:35.273 --> 49:36.474
[Dagen] What?

49:38.643 --> 49:40.578
He speaks to my mind.

49:46.551 --> 49:50.321
We're connected through
the Darkspore, somehow.

49:50.355 --> 49:51.222
He says

49:52.657 --> 49:56.694
if I help him defeat the
gods, he'll spare the world.

49:56.727 --> 49:59.430
That's a nasty dilemma.

49:59.464 --> 50:01.632
You can't believe a single word
of it.

50:01.666 --> 50:02.667
Not a single word.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.535
And if it's true?

50:04.569 --> 50:06.771
If I could stop the killing,

50:06.804 --> 50:08.239
I couldn't live with myself
knowing that...

50:08.273 --> 50:11.142
You wouldn't live, Marek.

50:11.176 --> 50:12.510
None of us would.

50:15.546 --> 50:16.581
At least there wouldn't be
anybody left

50:16.614 --> 50:18.816
to regret not saving.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.385
It's not funny.

50:21.719 --> 50:22.587
It's true.

50:24.322 --> 50:26.657
And I don't actually know
why we're doing this;

50:26.691 --> 50:29.094
you think I don't have my
doubts, that I don't wish

50:29.127 --> 50:30.461
I'd just given the Darkspore to
Ana-Sett

50:30.495 --> 50:32.230
and lived with you on the beach?

50:32.263 --> 50:33.264
Fyke, Dagen!

50:34.232 --> 50:36.334
I gave the Darkspore,

50:36.367 --> 50:39.570
I gave the Darkspore up for the
Crown.

50:39.604 --> 50:43.141
And now everyone is
dying, and it's my fault!

50:43.174 --> 50:44.642
I don't know what I'll do if
Szorlok comes to me again...

50:44.675 --> 50:47.778
No, no no no no no, no, no.

50:47.812 --> 50:50.748
Forget everything that I just
said.

50:52.217 --> 50:54.752
You stick to the plan, remember?

50:56.387 --> 50:58.656
First, we go to Battlegrave,

51:00.225 --> 51:03.328
we find an entrance to the
Underworld.

51:03.361 --> 51:05.630
And then, we get the Hammer,

51:06.864 --> 51:07.732
and then,

51:10.468 --> 51:11.302
well then...

51:11.336 --> 51:12.237
We walk up to Szorlok

51:12.270 --> 51:15.540
and smash his black heart into
oblivion?

51:20.611 --> 51:21.479
Yeah.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.648
More or less.

51:24.682 --> 51:27.318
(Marek laughs)

51:29.787 --> 51:32.723
Do you see how crazy that
sounds?

51:35.226 --> 51:38.496
How impossible each part of the
plan is?

51:40.665 --> 51:42.600
We're all going to die,

51:43.501 --> 51:44.635
because of me.

51:46.904 --> 51:47.872
Marek, no.

51:50.375 --> 51:52.710
(Marek sobs)

51:55.380 --> 51:59.250
(melancholy orchestral music)

52:14.199 --> 52:15.800
Hang on, hang on now.

52:17.202 --> 52:17.868
Let's see.

52:19.904 --> 52:22.940
Now that we're on foot,
we've been traveling

52:22.973 --> 52:25.243
across country due south.

52:27.545 --> 52:31.782
With any luck, there should
still be a watering hole

52:31.816 --> 52:35.286
on the high road, just on the
other side

52:36.254 --> 52:38.589
of that mountain right there.

52:39.890 --> 52:44.829
And from there, we go west,
to the Valley of Rath.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.364
So,

52:46.397 --> 52:49.234
if we travel day and night,

52:49.267 --> 52:50.635
by sundown on the third day,

52:50.668 --> 52:52.437
we should arrive at Battlegrave.

52:52.470 --> 52:53.738
It's too late.

52:55.406 --> 52:56.341
It's too late.

52:56.374 --> 52:57.242
No, no.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.346
You can't rest yet, Marek.

53:01.379 --> 53:03.548
Just a bit further, come on.

53:03.581 --> 53:04.449
I can't.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.853
Then stay with me.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.389
Come on.

53:12.823 --> 53:13.691
Come on.

53:17.262 --> 53:17.928
That's it.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.867
[Teela] Thane.

53:22.900 --> 53:23.734
[Thane] What is it?

53:23.768 --> 53:24.969
The gods are troubled.

53:25.002 --> 53:27.705
They sense that Marek's
resolve is faltering.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.974
She is tempted to serve Szorlok.

53:30.007 --> 53:31.542
Never.

53:31.576 --> 53:33.744
She would never do that.

53:33.778 --> 53:37.915
But if she could stop the
bloodshed by joining him?

53:40.418 --> 53:41.819
How can this be?

53:41.852 --> 53:43.621
Szorlok would give the world
to her

53:43.654 --> 53:45.390
in exchange for the heavens.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.892
He seeks to overthrow the gods.

53:48.793 --> 53:51.596
He would just leave the world
in peace?

53:51.629 --> 53:53.864
(Teela sighs)

53:53.898 --> 53:55.433
[Ana-Sett] The lives of
mortals

53:55.466 --> 53:57.768
are like flowers in the field.

53:57.802 --> 54:00.805
They bloom and die, and bloom
again.

54:02.307 --> 54:06.344
But if the gods perish, the
world will be forever changed.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.314
We will not allow Marek to aid
him.

54:11.482 --> 54:13.351
We have to help her.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.888
Help her, or stop her.

54:22.627 --> 54:26.030
(airy, fantastical music)

55:07.004 --> 55:09.874
We'll never make it across
that.

55:13.611 --> 55:16.914
(Dagen laughs)

55:16.947 --> 55:20.885
On Rathos' balls. (Chuckles)

55:21.886 --> 55:22.887
Whoa.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.355
(horse neighs)

55:24.389 --> 55:25.656
Easy, boy, easy.

55:27.958 --> 55:28.826
Easy.

55:30.160 --> 55:30.995
Come here.

55:31.028 --> 55:33.731
(smooches kiss)

55:33.764 --> 55:35.933
These are soldiers' horses.

55:35.966 --> 55:37.768
This is it, Marek.

55:37.802 --> 55:39.937
The sign we've been waiting for.

55:39.970 --> 55:41.439
The gods are with us.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.574
The gods be damned.

55:43.608 --> 55:44.942
There she is.

55:44.975 --> 55:47.845
It's good to have you back,
Marek my dear.

55:47.878 --> 55:49.380
(Marek groans)
No.

55:49.414 --> 55:53.050
Have you never ridden before?
(Marek pants)

55:53.083 --> 55:54.985
How long have you known me?

55:55.019 --> 55:56.487
I was a slave, remember?

55:56.521 --> 55:59.990
Ah, truly, we are the
saddest heroes ever.

56:00.024 --> 56:01.992
Lost all four pieces of the
Darkspore,

56:02.026 --> 56:06.363
gave away the war wagon, and
not all of us can ride a horse.

56:07.732 --> 56:09.834
I have a spell that shrinks
body parts,

56:09.867 --> 56:11.836
and you've gotten pretty
confident lately.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.738
(Dagen laughs)

56:13.771 --> 56:15.506
[Dagen] Very good.

56:16.574 --> 56:20.478
(adventurous orchestral music)

57:14.932 --> 57:18.536
(breathing heavily)

57:18.569 --> 57:19.504
Warspire.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.942
(horse whinnies)

57:24.975 --> 57:25.843
Come on.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.245
They're exhausted.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.580
We'll go on foot.

57:29.614 --> 57:30.447
We can't.

57:30.481 --> 57:32.116
People are dying every moment we
delay.

57:32.149 --> 57:34.051
Marek, there's nothing left.

57:34.084 --> 57:36.754
(horse snorts)

58:01.912 --> 58:05.516
(Marek breathes heavily)

58:14.224 --> 58:15.660
Hey.

58:15.693 --> 58:18.128
We'll set up camp soon.

58:18.162 --> 58:20.130
Just on the other side of that
ridge,

58:20.164 --> 58:22.032
there'll be less snow.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.102
Come on, Marek.

58:26.103 --> 58:28.038
A bit further, come on.

58:41.786 --> 58:43.187
[Szorlok] Marek.

58:44.655 --> 58:47.592
(mysterious music)

58:48.926 --> 58:51.195
Why should I trust you?

58:51.228 --> 58:53.163
Never trust a man.

58:53.197 --> 58:55.132
Only trust his motives.

58:56.033 --> 58:59.670
I will stop at nothing
to tear the heavens down.

58:59.704 --> 59:01.038
Why?

59:01.071 --> 59:01.939
Why?

59:05.009 --> 59:07.211
To become a god, of course.

59:08.112 --> 59:11.716
For there is to be no power
equal to mine.

59:12.617 --> 59:14.819
I know a way to stop you.

59:16.654 --> 59:20.090
Your life is entwined
with the Darkspore.

59:20.124 --> 59:24.361
Should you destroy it,
you'll destroy yourself.

59:24.394 --> 59:26.797
Your heart beats with mine.

59:27.665 --> 59:29.667
People are dying, Marek.

59:31.101 --> 59:33.671
More blood on your hands.

59:33.704 --> 59:37.842
Should you wait too long,
there'll be no one left to save.

59:38.809 --> 59:41.712
I won't betray my friends.

59:41.746 --> 59:44.949
Together, we'll find a way to
stop you.

59:45.950 --> 59:47.818
Nothing can stop me.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.024
You're nearly at your
destination,

59:54.992 --> 59:57.327
where you will lose all hope.

59:59.797 --> 01:00:04.334
Still, even when your
friends turn against you,

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:06.370
I will come to your aid.

01:00:33.698 --> 01:00:35.032
Wake up, Dagen.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.804
(Dagen groans)

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:40.705
Balls.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.842
I dreamt we were at a great
feast,

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:48.445
and everyone was dancing,

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.348
there was a bath filled with
wine.

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:57.121
[Marek] The last of the
rations.

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:00.290
[Dagen] No, Marek.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.693
No, that's alright.

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.128
Here, you take it.

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:11.435
(sweeping orchestral music)

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.034
It's Battlegrave.

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.736
Yeah, we made it.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:51.408
Now let's go find that
gateway to the Underworld.

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.847
(haunting orchestral music)

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:04.721
(people screaming faintly)

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.533
"Here lies Tek, God of the
Forge."

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.871
"Slain in battle with Amuhn-Kah."

01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:00.878
"An immortal sacrifice
to provoke the gods."

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.249
He can't really have died.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:09.954
Or if he did, he couldn't
take the Hammer with him,

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.922
nothing goes with you when you
die.

01:03:11.956 --> 01:03:14.892
A god dies and all he
gets is this broken anvil

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:16.861
in this forsaken place.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:21.298
They better build a giant temple
for me.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:22.599
I want visitors from all over
the world

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.270
and a giant statue made out of
gold.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.038
Don't count on it.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.408
There must be a sign.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.844
A spell, something.

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:36.080
Some mention of the Hammer.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:42.152
It could be a passage to the
Underworld.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:46.056
(speaking in foreign language)

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.092
(sighs)

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.328
At sunset, they will attack.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.164
I want everyone here, women,
children, I don't care.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:55.532
Give them all torches or
crossbows,

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.301
tell them to stand their ground.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.602
They're all going to die anyway

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.538
if Szorlok's forces get
past this barricade.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.974
Might as well die fighting.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.181
[Ana-Sett] Marek.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:16.653
The Hammer has to be here
somewhere.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:20.958
If Tek really died, he
couldn't take it with him.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:30.000
(gloomy orchestral music)

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.671
Mortals have to die to
get to the Underworld,

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:39.043
but if you're dead, you're
stuck there, of course.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:44.314
If Tek left the Hammer in
our world, where would it be?

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:54.091
Just like he said.
Who said?

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:57.327
Szorlok.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:01.131
He said I'd get here and lost
all hope.

01:05:01.165 --> 01:05:03.633
Szorlok's a liar, so
let's just take a step back

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.236
and think this through
logically.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.406
What if I was meant to
stop the armies of undead

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:12.042
but not how we thought?

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:16.180
If I help Szorlok take down the
gods, the killing will stop.

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:18.282
We can rebuild.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:24.454
What, with Szorlok as the
one and only god of this world?

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:27.657
And you as what, his queen?

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:29.693
No, nothing like that.

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:33.597
There is a way to
get that Hammer, Marek.

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.099
I know there is.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:39.269
You had a reason to trade the
Darkspore for the Iron Crown,

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:41.305
I know you had a reason.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:45.242
Don't have faith in me.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.547
I've done everything wrong.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:53.583
I'm just, (chuckles)

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.086
I'm just guessing, and
I keep getting it wrong,

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.389
and you and Thane and Teela,
you won't give up on me;

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.291
you're all fyking mad.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:03.493
Thane.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:04.361
Thane.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.229
We need to go.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:06.096
It's Marek.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.197
What about her?

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.566
She is losing herself,
she is giving in to Szorlok.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.534
No.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:12.302
There must be some mistake.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:15.639
[Ana-Sett] She is wavering
and she will fail us.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.707
We can change her mind.

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.378
I will take us to her.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:25.549
But I don't have the power
to move us many more times.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.025
(thunder rumbles)

01:06:35.059 --> 01:06:35.992
[Ana-Sett] Marek!

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:36.793
[Dagen] Oh! Hey, we're all
friends here.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.096
[Ana-Sett] You've gone too
far.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.497
[Dagen] Please.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.732
[Ana-Sett] Your resolve has
grown weak.

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:46.770
You have allowed Szorlok's
lies to persuade you.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.740
You and all the other gods.

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:54.178
You're all weak and afraid.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:59.349
You know Szorlok is coming for
you,

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:02.652
and yet, you would let everyone
die

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:06.022
rather than sacrifice one of
your own.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.458
Isn't it better to let the gods
die

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:11.328
than let every living thing turn
undead?

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:14.664
[Ana-Sett] You speak
blasphemy, necromancer.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.166
You cannot be allowed to
continue

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.668
on this path of destruction.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:19.836
Are you here to stop me?

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.605
No no no, no!

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:22.706
Marek!

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.109
Please don't, I can't resist her
will.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.076
[Thane] Teela?

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:28.512
(Teela gasps)

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.749
(energy crackles)

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:33.750
Teela!

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:34.751
Hold Ana-Sett back!

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.386
[Dagen] No no, Teela,
Teela, my good woman!

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.587
Please!

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:40.357
Marek's just, she's figuring
things out!

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:41.525
She's not siding with Szorlok,

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.327
she's under a lot of pressure
right now.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.597
Thane, please just, talk
some sense into Teela.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:48.598
Marek.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.200
Tell us!

01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:51.101
[Szorlok] Marek.

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:52.336
Tell Ana-Sett!

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.404
You would never be
lured by Szorlok's plan.

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:55.839
[Szorlok] The darkness
strengthens us,

01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:57.841
It draws you to me.
I know you.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:58.708
[Thane] I know you would
never...

01:07:58.742 --> 01:07:59.609
Yes Marek, please just tell
them!

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:02.112
- I've been waiting so long.
- Stop it!

01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:03.413
All of you!

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:05.249
You don't understand.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.519
You don't carry this burden.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:12.356
The choices I've had to make,

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:15.192
the choices I still have to
make.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:20.330
[Ana-Sett] The gods can
see what is in your mind.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:21.698
Leave me alone!

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:28.272
(Marek yells)

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.510
[Ana-Sett] This must never
come to be!

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:39.216
(energy crackling)

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.850
(dramatic music)

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.425
Foolish mortal.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.361
You are like a child in a
whirlwind.

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.397
Without the Darkspore,
you are nothing more

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:55.564
than a common wizard!

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:59.269
I am anything but a common
wizard!

01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:01.571
I don't need the Darkspore.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:04.573
I am a natural-born necromancer.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:05.442
(wind howls)

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.412
Marek, you don't have to do
that!

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.350
(Marek yells)

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:21.390
Marek! No!

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.828
I don't want to, Thane!

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.799
The Darkspore, it's a part of
me, and

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.203
I have to finish what I was born
to do.

01:09:33.237 --> 01:09:37.541
[Ana-Sett] You have proven
yourself through your actions.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.975
There is too much at stake.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.778
You will not survive this!

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:45.982
(energy crackling)
(Marek yelling)

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.618
(soaring, exciting music)

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:58.228
Teela!

01:09:58.262 --> 01:09:58.928
Enough!

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:06.470
(magic crackles)

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.207
(Dagen groans)

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.610
Szorlok, save me.

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.413
Marek, no!

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.657
What have you done?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.695
She's gone.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:35.632
You have doomed us all.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.569
(Teela whimpers)

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:40.570
(Dagen yells)

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:43.340
(swords clang)

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:50.414
Thane, you idiot!

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.788
After all we've been
through, you know Marek!

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:00.023
You know that she would never...

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.591
Do what, Dagen?

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:06.563
Never give away the final
piece of the Darkspore?

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:09.265
Never join Szorlok to fight us?

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:12.669
We all feared this day might
come.

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:14.738
Oh, don't you dare!

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:18.575
She saved you Thane,
she gave you a new life!

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:20.944
And you, Teela.

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:27.784
I can't hardly look at you
and what you've become.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:36.660
(heart-wrenching orchestral
music)

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.868
(Teela sobs)

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:56.846
(heavy, ominous music)

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.485
You have come to me at last.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.820
As I knew you would.
(thunder rumbles)

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.855
I had no other choice.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:09.693
Your friends have turned
against you.

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.928
They know who you are.

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:13.029
What you are.

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:16.065
And what you must do.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:20.069
They could never understand us.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.907
There is no us.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.742
I'm here to stop you.

01:12:28.612 --> 01:12:31.681
Kill you, if I get the chance.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.717
Would you like to try?

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:39.823
The Darkspore feeds me with
the lives of every lost soul.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:43.059
(inhales deeply)

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.828
I am infinite power.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:49.165
But it's not enough to defeat
the gods.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.768
For that, you still need my
help.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:54.671
(Szorlok scoffs)

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:55.639
Come, then.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.411
And witness for yourself as the
gods look on and do nothing.

01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:05.381
The subjects are made to
suffer, even to death.

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:09.519
(thunder rumbles)

01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:16.059
(Teela sniffles)

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:26.570
[Thane] Teela.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.942
We have to save Marek.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.147
You can't let him go.

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.090
If you really cared for Marek,

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.593
you wouldn't give up on her.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.796
We can still fight Szorlok!

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.163
We can defeat him!

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:55.565
We can save Marek!

01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.666
How, Thane?

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:58.868
Huh?

01:13:58.902 --> 01:13:59.936
Tell me how!

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.472
You're always coming up
with such brilliant plans,

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:03.840
so let's hear it!

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:06.776
Tek's Hammer.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:11.481
(laughs) We don't have the
hammer.

01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:14.751
Right, it's in the fyking
Underworld!

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.720
Then we'll go to the
Underworld and get it.

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:17.654
Oh!

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.155
Okay!

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.757
Great, why didn't I think of
that?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.859
Oh wait, that's right,
because you have to die

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:25.629
to get to the Underworld, Thane.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.197
Yeah.
(bittersweet orchestral music)

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.265
That's one way.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.968
So unless, you halfwit,
other than coming back

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:34.003
as a zombie, you know of some
way

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.573
to come back from the dead...

01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:41.611
Thane.

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.649
Oh, Thane, you are a genius!

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:46.983
Oh, think this through!

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.785
It's brilliant!

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.556
I can't believe we didn't
think of it sooner!

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.191
We're going to the Underworld.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.726
Of course.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.627
How?

01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:00.930
We're going to kill ourselves.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:05.101
Yes (chuckles), are you ready to
die?

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:15.511
(malevolent orchestral music)

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:32.629
Tell me about my mother.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.566
Your mother was a thief.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.201
A very skilled thief.

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:41.871
Under my guidance, she stole
the piece of the Darkspore

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:45.041
held within the Well of Demons
for me.

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.811
But she didn't give it to you.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:52.281
She took the money,
but kept the Darkspore.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:58.021
Your mother lacked your,
shall we say, integrity.

01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:01.725
My mother left me with
nothing.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:06.262
Her cruelty was a gift
that made you strong.

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:12.602
Suffering and depression were
the stones that sharpened you.

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:17.273
There should be enough
here to kill us both.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.309
One drop will knock you out,
two will stop your heart,

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:22.245
and three would kill a horse.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.614
Three drops for you, my friend.

01:16:24.648 --> 01:16:26.049
But like you said, once we're
dead,

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.917
we can't come back with the
Hammer.

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:29.185
That's not what I said.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:32.321
What I said was unless we have
a way of coming back to life,

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:35.258
which, oddly enough, we do.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.626
Teela.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.326
Teela.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.764
Oh.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:41.665
Yes.

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.867
I can, of course.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:46.002
Maybe.

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:51.808
But you won't have much time,
and I can only do this once.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:53.777
The longer your spirit
is out of your body,

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:57.180
the more impossible it will
be for me to bring you back.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:59.783
How much time, exactly.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.719
Maybe 60 heartbeats, 80 at the
most;

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:06.155
any longer and you might be gone
for good.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:08.624
However...

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:10.259
Yes?

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:15.131
Time may pass differently
in the Underworld.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:17.300
Right, faster or slower?

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:21.671
I don't know.

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:26.442
Right, 80 heartbeats.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.944
Have to be quick then, no
sightseeing

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.780
in the Underworld, yeah?

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:32.882
Should I lie down?

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:33.917
Good idea.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.955
I wouldn't call of any of
this a particularly good idea.

01:17:41.858 --> 01:17:43.993
In case we don't get back.

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:53.369
(sighs)

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.073
See you on the other side.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:58.107
For Marek.

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:00.109
For Marek.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:05.749
Teela, if you would be so
kind.

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:09.185
Three drops to be sure, four for
Thane.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:10.086
Fyke.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.001
We can do this.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:29.338
Come back to me.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.239
I will.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:35.879
(tender orchestral music)

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:52.929
It didn't work.

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:58.201
The poison must have...
Give it a minute.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.836
Wait, where's Teela?

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:02.738
(hammer clanging)

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:17.020
- Is that?
- Has to be.

01:19:17.921 --> 01:19:20.323
None other than Tek himself.

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.929
Greetings, Tek, your
godliness.

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:31.534
We beseech thee to bestow
upon us thy godly hammer.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:40.409
We've come for the Hammer of
Tek.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:43.579
We need it to destroy
the Lich King Szorlok.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.048
Well, you're dead.

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:47.283
There's not much you can do
about it now.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.586
Well, actually, we
have a goddess, Ana-Sett,

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.322
waiting for us on the other
side to bring us back.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.824
But we don't have much time.

01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:58.027
What is it going to
take to get the Hammer?

01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:01.030
You don't have what it takes.

01:20:01.064 --> 01:20:03.032
I've waited centuries for the
right one

01:20:03.066 --> 01:20:04.600
to come asking for it.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:07.236
I don't see anything in you
to convince me otherwise.

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:08.604
We're all you've got!

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.339
No one else is coming!

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:11.207
We're it!

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.176
It's not good enough.

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:18.147
We're not leaving without that
hammer.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.185
Then welcome.

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:24.353
Welcome to the Underworld.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:27.290
Four.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.357
Five.

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:29.525
Six.

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:34.163
(soaring, evil orchestral music)

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:37.066
(thunder rumbles)

01:20:49.913 --> 01:20:54.050
(Marek yells)
(energy fizzes)

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:09.598
I'm far beyond that now,
Marek.

01:21:12.068 --> 01:21:16.005
The only question is, how
many more lives will be lost

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:18.107
before you give in to me?

01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:22.345
So much needless death.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.647
Save them.

01:21:25.949 --> 01:21:28.084
Save your friends.

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:31.921
They would rather die
than see me help you.

01:21:33.256 --> 01:21:36.259
(Marek yells)
(fire whooshes)

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:39.495
(music swells)

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:42.331
(Szorlok laughs)

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:45.068
33.

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:46.535
34.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:47.436
35.

01:21:56.379 --> 01:21:57.546
So how's this work?

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:01.050
We very well can't fight to
the death in the Underworld.

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:02.651
I don't know.

01:22:02.685 --> 01:22:05.221
Is there an under-Underworld?

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:07.623
(Thane yells)

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.558
(Tek grunts)
(hammer thumps)

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:12.261
(Thane groans)

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.230
(Dagen yells)

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.564
(hammer thumps)

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.733
(Tek laughs)

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.536
(Dagen coughs)

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.605
(groans)

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:27.343
Can't die, but it still hurts,
huh?

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:29.345
This isn't working.

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:31.380
You have a better idea?

01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:33.449
(Dagen yells)

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:35.451
(Dagen grunts)
(Tek chuckles)

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:36.619
45, 46.

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:38.554
When I touch the hammer,
I can see the living world!

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:39.488
Thane, we need to hurry!

01:22:39.522 --> 01:22:40.489
Help!

01:22:40.523 --> 01:22:43.126
(Dagen yells)

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:46.262
(Thane shouts)

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.964
(Thane groans)

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:52.501
The hammer's not dead.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:55.671
The hammer doesn't belong here,

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.673
it's part of the living world.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.375
Yeah, what of it?

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:01.110
How did you get it here, then?

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:03.146
It's my hammer, and I'm a god.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.014
In case you've forgotten.

01:23:05.048 --> 01:23:07.116
We have our own rules.

01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:10.153
So how do we get it to the
living world?

01:23:10.186 --> 01:23:13.356
You're a clever boy, I'm
sure you'll figure it out.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:14.657
(hammer whooshes)
(Dagen groans)

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.025
53.

01:23:16.059 --> 01:23:16.725
54.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.527
55.

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:23.532
56; I can't wait any longer,
even now we run the risk.

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:25.434
[Ana-Sett] Patience.

01:23:33.176 --> 01:23:35.578
(Thane yells)

01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:41.250
(Thane groans)

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.554
You're very strong.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:48.424
I wonder just how hard you could
hit me.

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:50.326
I could knock you
clean out of this valley.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:54.497
(Dagen laughs) Dog's balls,
you could.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.299
I've seen what you've got, now.

01:23:56.332 --> 01:23:57.733
However, I'll give you a clean
shot.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.502
I mean, I am dead, after all.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:02.271
(laughs) So long, half-elf.

01:24:02.305 --> 01:24:03.439
(metal clinks)

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:04.540
Run, Thane!

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:08.111
(Dagen yells)

01:24:08.144 --> 01:24:08.811
75.

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.347
76!

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.648
77!

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:15.418
That's it, I'm calling you back.

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:20.456
(bewitching orchestral music)

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:26.762
Fyke.

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:29.132
(Thane groans)

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.134
Ah, damn it!

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:32.768
It didn't work!

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.770
Come on, Dagen.

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:36.004
Come on!

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:39.808
No, there's no time left,
I have to bring him back now.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:42.578
Please.

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:47.283
Please, we need this hammer,
everything depends on it!

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:48.651
Come on, Dagen!

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.720
We're running out of time!

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:53.389
Dagen, damn it!

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:54.557
Dagen!

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:55.424
He's fighting me!

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.460
He's resisting, he has to let or
I can't!

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:58.561
Dagen!

01:24:58.594 --> 01:24:59.728
Come on, live!

01:25:03.699 --> 01:25:04.567
No.

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:08.404
No, there has to be a way,
it's on the tip of my brain,

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:09.805
just tell me!

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:10.773
Last chance.

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:12.441
If you don't let go, you'll be
stuck here.

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.543
My life doesn't matter.

01:25:15.678 --> 01:25:17.680
I can't let her down; there was
a reason

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:20.383
that she brought us here,
just like there was a reason

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:21.750
that she took the.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:25.521
Crown.

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:29.392
The Iron Crown, of course.

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:30.293
Good.

01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:31.160
Good!

01:25:31.194 --> 01:25:32.395
Come on!

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:33.596
No, Dagen!

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:35.231
Come on!

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:36.232
Damn it!

01:25:36.265 --> 01:25:37.500
Dagen!

01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:38.767
No!

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.404
(Thane yells)

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.773
(Thane sobs)

01:25:46.209 --> 01:25:46.875
No.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:53.449
(Teela sobs)

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:57.920
- I tried.
- No!

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:00.256
I tried.

01:26:01.957 --> 01:26:02.825
I tried.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.596
(Marek gasping)

01:26:10.233 --> 01:26:13.302
(thunder rumbles)

01:26:13.336 --> 01:26:14.203
Dagen?

01:26:15.571 --> 01:26:19.808
You attack me because
of those you call friends.

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:24.213
By fighting me, you believe
you're staying loyal to them.

01:26:24.247 --> 01:26:24.913
But look.

01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:38.561
(Thane yells)

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:39.462
No!

01:26:39.495 --> 01:26:42.265
(dramatic music)

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:52.508
They killed him because he
defended you.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:56.445
No, I won't believe it.

01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:58.281
Thane wouldn't have...

01:26:58.314 --> 01:26:59.782
You felt him die.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.585
You know it's true.

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:08.791
Your friends have become
pawns, played by the gods.

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:11.960
It's her.

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:13.829
Ana-Sett.

01:27:15.331 --> 01:27:16.399
She did this.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.934
The gods will stop at nothing

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.970
'til they see you safely dead.

01:27:22.004 --> 01:27:24.006
They are coming for you.

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:30.513
Not if I come for them first.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.282
Yes.

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:37.686
Open yourself to me.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.756
Combine your power with
mine, and together,

01:27:40.789 --> 01:27:42.658
we will slay the gods.

01:27:45.828 --> 01:27:46.695
Show me.

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:55.371
(melancholy acoustic music)

01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:58.807
Rest well, my friend.

01:28:00.676 --> 01:28:03.546
The Darkspore can't reach you
now.

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:17.393
It shouldn't have ended like
this.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.629
It isn't the end.

01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:26.569
We must hurry now, stop
Marek from joining Szorlok.

01:28:26.602 --> 01:28:28.737
Together, they will destroy the
gods

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:31.407
and then all will be lost.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.376
I can't do it, Teela.

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:36.579
I can't fight against Marek.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.081
It's too much.

01:28:58.601 --> 01:28:59.602
Put it on.

01:29:01.804 --> 01:29:02.671
Hey.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:06.542
No.

01:29:08.544 --> 01:29:09.878
Thane, put it on!

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:13.115
Yes.

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:15.684
Put it on your head, wear it.

01:29:16.752 --> 01:29:17.953
Wear the crown!

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:22.691
Come on, you big dumb
ox, it's right there!

01:29:22.725 --> 01:29:24.893
The hammer is right here; no!

01:29:24.927 --> 01:29:25.794
Thane!

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:27.896
Thane!

01:29:39.675 --> 01:29:41.544
We have to stop her.

01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:58.461
Keep the hammer.

01:29:59.528 --> 01:30:00.929
You've earned it.

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:04.867
I don't need your bloody
hammer now.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.803
Don't you see what you've done?

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:09.772
After all that you've been
through,

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:11.840
I'm surprised you're giving up
so easily.

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:12.741
Easily?

01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:14.477
I'm dead!

01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:17.646
Deceased!

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.982
Erased from existence;
I'm a ghost like you,

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:21.950
if you haven't noticed.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.689
Why didn't you tell us
how to get the hammer

01:30:26.722 --> 01:30:29.492
before it was too late?

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:33.529
You sacrificed yourself,
I didn't see that coming.

01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:35.598
You know, you'd think, for
being a god,

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:39.502
you could have seen that
in me from the start.

01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:47.810
If Thane had put on the crown,

01:30:48.977 --> 01:30:51.714
he would have seen and been
able to take the hammer

01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:53.549
from me, wouldn't he?

01:30:55.117 --> 01:30:56.151
Yes.

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:58.887
(Dagen chuckles)

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:01.790
A lot of good it does Marek
now.

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:04.693
So now what?

01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:10.533
I get my own anvil and just
make swords for eternity?

01:31:10.566 --> 01:31:12.568
The Underworld is what you
make it.

01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:15.003
I'm a blacksmith, that's what I
do.

01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:17.205
I think you would be better
served getting started,

01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:19.107
you have a long way to go.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:21.510
A long way to go?

01:31:21.544 --> 01:31:22.878
Where?

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:24.112
Find your woman!

01:31:24.146 --> 01:31:26.214
That's what you're here for.

01:31:26.248 --> 01:31:27.583
Is she here?

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:29.151
I mean, where is she?

01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:30.719
I don't even know where to
start.

01:31:30.753 --> 01:31:32.755
The Underworld is a lot
like the living world,

01:31:32.788 --> 01:31:35.023
but not all the same rules
apply.

01:31:35.057 --> 01:31:38.060
(chuckles) Right.

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:40.362
Right.

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:47.703
(epic orchestral music)

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:58.046
Now, let the gods pay for
their apathy,

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:02.017
their vanity, and their
arrogance.

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:09.124
(energy crackling)

01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:11.727
(thunder rumbling)
(Marek yelling)

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.161
Feed our strength.

01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:16.298
Let us taste your power!

01:32:18.667 --> 01:32:22.004
(dramatic, wicked music)

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:25.774
(Marek yelling)

01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:31.714
(Szorlok laughs)

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:32.615
Yes!

01:32:33.315 --> 01:32:34.182
All of it!

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:36.184
Give it to me!

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.570
(explosions booming)

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:06.882
(optimistic fantasy music)

01:33:11.854 --> 01:33:13.822
(energy crackling)

01:33:13.856 --> 01:33:14.723
No!

01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:17.025
You!

01:33:17.059 --> 01:33:18.593
You killed Dagen!

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:21.263
(Marek screams)

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:22.297
Marek, no!

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:26.134
No!

01:33:26.168 --> 01:33:28.837
We're here to save you!

01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:32.808
I hardly look like the
one that needs saving!

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:38.013
(women yelling)

01:33:38.914 --> 01:33:40.248
Marek!

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:42.084
We didn't kill Dagen!

01:33:43.318 --> 01:33:47.122
He took his own life to
reach the Underworld!

01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:50.158
We found it.

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.095
We found the Hammer.

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.296
The Hammer?

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:55.330
Where is it?

01:33:57.032 --> 01:33:59.167
We couldn't bring it back.

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:01.003
Dagen wouldn't come back.

01:34:01.036 --> 01:34:02.637
It was his choice.

01:34:03.438 --> 01:34:06.041
He only wanted to save you.

01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:08.210
You're all he cares about.

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:18.086
(dramatic, wicked music)

01:34:19.454 --> 01:34:22.190
(Szorlok gasps)

01:34:28.463 --> 01:34:30.198
The gods are dead.

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:33.969
I am the only god.

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:37.439
The one god.

01:34:37.472 --> 01:34:40.108
(thunder rumbles)

01:34:40.142 --> 01:34:41.143
All is mine.

01:34:45.447 --> 01:34:47.249
[Ana-Sett] Not all.

01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:52.387
There is still one goddess
who stands against you.

01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:54.189
Goddess?

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.361
I will drink you slowly.

01:35:00.395 --> 01:35:03.999
I will savor every last drop of
your soul.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.002
(Thane yells)

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:09.704
(Thane groans)

01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:15.343
(Ana-Sett yells)
(energy fizzes)

01:35:27.422 --> 01:35:30.292
(energy whooshes)

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:40.068
(weeping orchestral music)

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.850
(groans) Marek.

01:35:54.883 --> 01:35:56.484
You have to stop him.

01:35:58.353 --> 01:35:59.955
We believe in you.

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.390
You can do it.

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:04.459
I can't.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.362
I don't know what to do.

01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:15.070
Be strong.

01:36:17.405 --> 01:36:20.075
(Thane groans)

01:36:23.445 --> 01:36:27.315
(Szorlok breathes deeply)

01:36:27.349 --> 01:36:28.283
All mine.

01:36:34.089 --> 01:36:35.290
Marek, my dear.

01:36:36.859 --> 01:36:40.228
You made possible my ascension;
come.

01:36:40.262 --> 01:36:42.931
Witness my glory in full.
(thunder rumbles)

01:36:42.965 --> 01:36:44.933
You lied to me.

01:36:44.967 --> 01:36:47.235
My friends didn't betray me.

01:36:48.403 --> 01:36:50.472
I betrayed them.

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:53.108
A trivial difference.

01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:55.410
You were never like them.

01:36:55.443 --> 01:36:59.014
You were born for true
greatness.

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:00.315
Now come.

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:01.416
Take my hand.

01:37:02.584 --> 01:37:04.419
You've slain the gods.

01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:06.154
Now go to the heavens
and stay there alone,

01:37:06.188 --> 01:37:09.291
leave the mortal world
in peace like we agreed.

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:11.994
Do not presume to counsel me!

01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:16.198
All who do not worship me must
die.

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:20.102
(Marek groans)

01:37:21.069 --> 01:37:22.270
There, you see?

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:25.473
All will obey.

01:37:29.912 --> 01:37:34.049
(epic, fantastical orchestral
music)

01:38:19.094 --> 01:38:23.231
(moves into exciting military
music)

01:38:25.267 --> 01:38:28.203
(zombies growling)

01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:36.544
Hold!

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:39.081
Hold for all you believe!

01:38:39.114 --> 01:38:41.516
(group yells)

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:01.503
So this was your plan all
along?

01:39:01.536 --> 01:39:03.105
To have Szorlok steal your life
force away

01:39:03.138 --> 01:39:06.274
and trap your soul inside his
body?

01:39:06.308 --> 01:39:07.175
Plan?

01:39:08.176 --> 01:39:10.545
More of a possibility.

01:39:10.578 --> 01:39:12.014
But perhaps, when the moment is
right,

01:39:12.047 --> 01:39:13.281
I can take control of Szorlok

01:39:13.315 --> 01:39:16.018
and offer you a small advantage.

01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:20.355
See, I don't think he's
discovered me here yet.

01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:22.090
I don't envy you.

01:39:22.124 --> 01:39:25.193
Even Teela was a difficult
companion.

01:39:26.228 --> 01:39:27.595
How do I free you?

01:39:28.496 --> 01:39:30.298
The same way you free
yourself.

01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:32.300
Destroy the Darkspore.

01:39:32.334 --> 01:39:34.602
The Hammer of Tek is lost.

01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:38.606
I was a fool to join Szorlok.

01:39:40.508 --> 01:39:42.377
I've doomed the world.

01:39:44.312 --> 01:39:45.280
I can't tell you what to do,
Marek.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:47.749
What choice do I have?

01:39:47.782 --> 01:39:50.418
Countless thousands are dying.

01:39:50.452 --> 01:39:53.588
I have been fighting this
darkness my whole life,

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:55.457
struggling to break free.

01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:56.758
But to what end?

01:39:59.127 --> 01:40:00.528
Szorlok was right.

01:40:02.097 --> 01:40:04.666
I can't escape the Darkspore.

01:40:04.699 --> 01:40:06.568
My mother saw to that.

01:40:07.635 --> 01:40:10.638
I am a part of it, and
that is a part of me,

01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:12.207
that is who I am.

01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:16.111
Those who knew your mother

01:40:16.144 --> 01:40:19.414
remember only the villain and
the thief.

01:40:20.315 --> 01:40:23.451
Her mentor was cruel and without
principle

01:40:23.485 --> 01:40:26.788
and taught her nothing
of virtue and honor.

01:40:26.821 --> 01:40:28.790
That is who she was.

01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:31.193
My mother hated me.

01:40:31.226 --> 01:40:33.461
That is why she cursed me.

01:40:33.495 --> 01:40:36.398
But this is not the woman that
I knew.

01:40:36.431 --> 01:40:38.733
True, your mother stole the
Darkspore,

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:42.204
was bringing it to Szorlok
for a mountain of riches.

01:40:42.237 --> 01:40:45.173
But something changed.
(touching orchestral music)

01:40:45.207 --> 01:40:46.841
She refused his gold.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.744
She took the Darkspore and ran.

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:52.180
She hid in poverty.

01:40:52.214 --> 01:40:53.748
She sacrificed her life to keep
that shard

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:58.120
away from Szorlok's hands, and
no one could figure out why.

01:40:59.154 --> 01:41:01.123
Why did she do it?

01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:02.490
Because of you.

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:05.760
When she felt you moving in her
belly

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:06.994
and knew that she was
going to bring a child

01:41:07.028 --> 01:41:11.099
into this world, she made the
choice to fight the darkness

01:41:11.133 --> 01:41:13.135
to the very end.

01:41:13.168 --> 01:41:16.171
She died, to save the world for
you.

01:41:18.206 --> 01:41:19.407
She loved me.

01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:22.444
That is who she was.

01:41:22.477 --> 01:41:26.414
When I found her dying,
your mother was a hero.

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:34.389
But I still have this
curse inside of me.

01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.224
Curse, or blessing?

01:41:37.692 --> 01:41:40.762
You see, the Darkspore never
took part of you, Marek.

01:41:40.795 --> 01:41:42.530
You took part of it.

01:41:42.564 --> 01:41:44.866
You stole its power.

01:41:44.899 --> 01:41:48.703
That makes you the only one
with the power to destroy it.

01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:52.874
Why do you think Szorlok
sought you out all these years?

01:41:54.309 --> 01:41:58.313
If I destroy the
Darkspore, am I going to die?

01:42:06.388 --> 01:42:09.524
True heroes always make a
sacrifice.

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:16.398
You cannot fight the darkness
and come away unscathed.

01:42:16.431 --> 01:42:17.765
Like my mother.

01:42:18.733 --> 01:42:19.601
Like you.

01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:25.340
Believe in yourself, Marek,

01:42:25.373 --> 01:42:28.176
as I have always believed in
you.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:30.845
Go now.

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.915
And when the moment is right,

01:42:33.948 --> 01:42:37.819
Gojun Pye will come to
your aid one last time.

01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:46.528
(dark, heinous music)

01:42:50.365 --> 01:42:52.834
(wind howling)

01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:57.672
(moves into thrilling medieval
music)

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:00.242
(weapons clanging)

01:43:00.275 --> 01:43:04.346
(fighters yelling and groaning)

01:43:05.713 --> 01:43:08.650
(zombies snarling)

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:11.553
(girls screaming)

01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:21.929
(baby cries)

01:43:27.735 --> 01:43:31.539
You may be a god, but
you don't control me.

01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:37.645
We mortals can still choose
who and what we believe in.

01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:39.947
We decide whether to
give you power over us,

01:43:39.981 --> 01:43:44.319
and without our consent,
what are you even a god of?

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.856
All who resist my will are not
fit

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.625
to live in my world.

01:43:52.026 --> 01:43:54.962
You, Marek, have sealed their
fate.

01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:02.770
(zombies roaring)

01:44:30.465 --> 01:44:32.800
(wind howls)

01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:38.039
(Marek groans)

01:44:38.072 --> 01:44:39.341
Marek!

01:44:39.374 --> 01:44:41.776
(Marek yells)

01:44:44.479 --> 01:44:46.414
Marek, take the hammer!

01:44:47.582 --> 01:44:48.783
It's me, Dagen!

01:44:50.485 --> 01:44:53.020
No, you cannot give up now!

01:44:53.054 --> 01:44:55.323
You have to think, Marek!

01:44:56.358 --> 01:44:59.727
Think about the Crown and the
Hammer!

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:01.529
You think about why I would
choose

01:45:01.563 --> 01:45:02.864
to stay in the Underworld!

01:45:02.897 --> 01:45:05.933
(Marek yells)

01:45:05.967 --> 01:45:09.437
The Hammer is here Marek, now
take it!

01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:11.806
Put on the crown and take it!

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:19.080
I know that you can hear me!

01:45:21.749 --> 01:45:23.351
I love you, Marek.

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:27.522
Please put on the crown and
finish this.

01:45:31.393 --> 01:45:32.059
Yes.

01:45:33.895 --> 01:45:36.764
(thunder rumbles)

01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:42.504
(Marek gasps)

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:47.409
(moves into heart-wrenching
music)

01:45:47.442 --> 01:45:48.109
Dagen.

01:45:50.111 --> 01:45:52.747
(Marek grunts)

01:45:57.719 --> 01:46:00.154
How very clever of you.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:03.925
Even now, when all is lost,
you still cling to hope.

01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:05.760
(chuckles)

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:09.597
I shall take the greatest
pleasure in watching you die.

01:46:09.631 --> 01:46:10.465
(Marek yells)

01:46:10.498 --> 01:46:13.367
(energy crackles)

01:46:22.544 --> 01:46:23.945
Now, die!

01:46:23.978 --> 01:46:28.115
(energy crackles)
(Marek screams)

01:46:33.655 --> 01:46:34.522
Not yet!

01:46:39.594 --> 01:46:40.562
[Gojun Pye] Now, Marek.

01:46:40.595 --> 01:46:41.863
This is your chance.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:43.565
Get up!

01:46:43.598 --> 01:46:45.500
Get up, Marek!

01:46:45.533 --> 01:46:47.669
(Thane groans)

01:46:47.702 --> 01:46:48.903
I know you can!

01:46:55.042 --> 01:46:56.811
[Gojun Pye] I cannot keep him
at bay.

01:46:56.844 --> 01:46:58.846
His power is too strong.

01:47:00.482 --> 01:47:01.415
Now, Marek!

01:47:03.718 --> 01:47:07.622
(swells into heroic orchestral
music)

01:47:07.655 --> 01:47:10.458
(Szorlok groans)

01:47:13.528 --> 01:47:16.631
(thunder rumbles)

01:47:16.664 --> 01:47:19.534
(Szorlok screams)

01:47:35.216 --> 01:47:37.952
(zombies groan)

01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:47.595
(men laugh)

01:47:54.869 --> 01:47:56.037
Victory!

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.740
(men cheering)

01:48:00.608 --> 01:48:04.478
(triumphant orchestral music)

01:48:24.866 --> 01:48:28.936
(moves into tender string music)

01:48:30.071 --> 01:48:32.073
Hey ho, little marmot.

01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:36.110
We did it.

01:48:37.945 --> 01:48:38.813
We did it.

01:48:39.881 --> 01:48:43.885
You are the bravest
person I have ever known.

01:48:45.019 --> 01:48:45.953
I'm free.

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:06.574
(Thane and Teela sobbing)

01:49:20.622 --> 01:49:21.723
They were two of the greatest
heroes

01:49:21.756 --> 01:49:23.791
the world has ever known.

01:49:25.727 --> 01:49:29.597
The cripple slave girl
and a bastard half-elf.

01:49:30.665 --> 01:49:32.867
Will anyone ever remember?

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:33.768
We will.

01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:36.303
Aye.

01:49:37.271 --> 01:49:38.139
We will.

01:49:40.775 --> 01:49:42.576
Goodbye, old friends.

01:49:43.845 --> 01:49:45.713
Until we meet again.

01:49:47.682 --> 01:49:51.285
(elegant, bittersweet music)

01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:56.658
So the gods are all dead.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.162
What becomes of the world now?

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.732
When Ana-Sett lived within me,

01:50:04.766 --> 01:50:07.301
I caught glimpses of her mind.

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:10.071
I saw her beginning and her end.

01:50:11.005 --> 01:50:15.743
There was life before the gods,
and now there is life after.

01:50:15.777 --> 01:50:19.380
And there will be, from
eternity to eternity.

01:50:20.815 --> 01:50:23.685
Magic will fade and die, and
life,

01:50:25.052 --> 01:50:26.320
life will go on.

01:50:27.321 --> 01:50:30.224
Maybe someday, new gods will
arise,

01:50:30.257 --> 01:50:33.194
when the world is ready for
them.

01:50:33.227 --> 01:50:34.095
But,

01:50:34.962 --> 01:50:38.399
until that day, there is just us
mortals.

01:50:41.268 --> 01:50:42.136
Just us.

01:50:44.972 --> 01:50:47.341
I like the sound of that.

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:50.778
I recall a time when you
dreamed of finding a soft woman

01:50:50.812 --> 01:50:54.749
to settle down with,
maybe have children, even.

01:50:55.917 --> 01:50:57.251
Did I say that?

01:51:06.227 --> 01:51:09.063
(waves splashing)

01:51:21.042 --> 01:51:24.445
(gentle, heartfelt music)

01:52:43.257 --> 01:52:47.394
* Newly freed from pathways of
old

01:52:48.295 --> 01:52:51.498
* A hero's world ahead

01:52:54.568 --> 01:52:58.906
* Wandering realms of magic
unknown

01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:03.878
* I tremble where I tread

01:53:09.984 --> 01:53:12.453
* Save me once

01:53:15.857 --> 01:53:19.226
* Save me again and again

01:53:21.863 --> 01:53:25.933
* Just know I will not leave you

01:53:30.905 --> 01:53:34.108
* I will not disappear

01:53:39.013 --> 01:53:43.150
* While the world turns, I'll be
here

01:53:50.524 --> 01:53:54.862
* Arrows and crows fly over this
war

01:53:56.463 --> 01:53:59.466
* Raging down below

01:54:02.203 --> 01:54:06.273
* You and I have followed before

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:11.278
* Now tell me where to go

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:20.254
* Save me once

01:54:23.257 --> 01:54:26.860
* Save me again and again

01:54:29.163 --> 01:54:33.234
* Just know I will not leave you

01:54:38.272 --> 01:54:41.475
* I will not disappear

01:54:47.248 --> 01:54:51.385
* Let the glowing heat
of the fire at night

01:54:53.054 --> 01:54:57.191
* Break the darkness there
inside

01:54:58.993 --> 01:55:03.130
* You have earned me now,
but have I earned you

01:55:04.565 --> 01:55:08.902
* If you ask, I'll see this
through

01:55:11.172 --> 01:55:13.607
* Save me once

01:55:17.111 --> 01:55:20.514
* Save me again and again

01:55:23.317 --> 01:55:27.388
* Just know I will not leave you

01:55:32.126 --> 01:55:35.329
* I will not disappear

01:55:42.003 --> 01:55:46.140
* When the world ends, I'll be
here

01:55:51.445 --> 01:55:54.048
* I will stay

01:55:56.383 --> 01:55:58.585
* With you.

01:56:48.602 --> 01:56:51.472
(Szorlok screams)

01:57:02.183 --> 01:57:04.685
(mysterious music)

01:57:04.718 --> 01:57:07.721
(Zombie Girl gasps)

01:57:12.459 --> 01:57:13.527
Where am I?

01:57:14.628 --> 01:57:16.163
(humorous, mischievous music)
(Zombie Girl sniffs)

01:57:16.197 --> 01:57:18.799
What is that gods-forsaken
smell?

01:57:20.634 --> 01:57:22.236
Fyke, are you deaf?

01:57:22.269 --> 01:57:24.805
You answer me when I speak, you
inbreed.

01:57:24.838 --> 01:57:25.672
Where am I?

01:57:25.706 --> 01:57:27.341
(slap smacks)

01:57:27.374 --> 01:57:28.842
Look, lady, the war's over.

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:30.711
We're headed home.

01:57:30.744 --> 01:57:31.712
To Gibbon's Hole.

01:57:31.745 --> 01:57:32.613
War?

01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:34.481
(laughs)

01:57:34.515 --> 01:57:37.184
What war are you talking about?

01:57:37.218 --> 01:57:40.687
Never mind, just take me at
once to the palace at Kingsway.

01:57:40.721 --> 01:57:43.224
(sniggers)

01:57:43.257 --> 01:57:46.260
(peasants laughing)

01:57:56.503 --> 01:57:59.640
(Zombie Girl screams)
