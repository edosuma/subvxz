<i>Ma'am, you need to sit down,
you've just been in an accident.</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.780
Hey, get back.

00:50.016 --> 00:53.551
Sam? Honey, it's me, it's Mom.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.856
Ma'am, stay where you are.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.758
Ma'am, we need you to stay
where you are.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.125
I said, stay right there.

01:00.693 --> 01:03.394
Officers, she's my daughter.

01:05.498 --> 01:09.469
She's my daughter, Sam. Honey, it's me.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.837
Come to me. It's gonna be okay.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.674
I hate blood.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.357
Makes me queasy.

03:59.457 --> 04:02.076
Okay, just apply some pressure.

04:02.176 --> 04:06.646
So, what exactly am I testing for here?

04:06.936 --> 04:08.746
Everything.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.650
Okay, care to narrow that down a bit?

04:13.820 --> 04:17.555
Everything, just... everything.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.695
Hope she was worth it.

04:22.663 --> 04:26.433
Look, relax, okay? It's a lot harder
for guys to get these things.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.401
I'm sure you're fine and we'll have
your test results back in a week.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.840
I can't wait a week.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.646
Okay...

04:35.046 --> 04:37.607
look, I'll put a rush on it,
I'll call you when I get the results,

04:37.707 --> 04:41.348
- but you are gonna owe me.
- Fair enough. Thank you, thank you.

04:41.448 --> 04:45.111
And please, if you don't mind,
don't tell my sister about this. Alright?

04:45.211 --> 04:47.955
I can't stand another fucking
life lecture from her right now.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.958
Relax, okay, you are the least
of her worries right now.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.394
She's about to pop, I mean, between
the fucking hypnobirthing classes

04:54.494 --> 04:58.198
and the mood swings these
16-hour shifts are like a vacation.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.795
Alright, so, I'm gonna bring the nurse in
she's gonna give you some ointment

05:01.895 --> 05:04.268
and... a sucker.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.907
Green apple or blue raspberry?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.504
- Green apple.
- Alright.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.699
The fuck?

06:35.528 --> 06:37.261
Hi.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.530
Hey.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.639
Hello?

06:49.108 --> 06:50.641
Yeah.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.480
What?

06:57.116 --> 07:00.120
Oh, my God, I had... I had no idea.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.852
W...

07:02.622 --> 07:05.259
Yeah, over... yeah, I can...

07:05.359 --> 07:08.593
anyway I can help.
What's the... address?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.416
Riley McCormick, I'm Detective Young.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.601
Nice to meet you.

07:36.222 --> 07:39.059
- You want some water?
- No, I'm okay.

07:39.159 --> 07:42.378
- You want some tea?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

07:50.936 --> 07:52.207
It's just...

07:53.507 --> 07:56.053
just a few follow up questions.

07:57.009 --> 08:02.014
- Okay.
- How well did you know Alice Patrick?

08:02.114 --> 08:03.242
Pretty well.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.312
Holy shit.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.079
<i>She was a family friend.</i>

08:17.897 --> 08:19.589
Sam?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.179
She would come over during the holidays.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.743
Alice. Alice.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.493
She and my sister
were in dance together, so...

09:08.214 --> 09:10.471
I can call somebody.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.750
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
call someone to help us.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.474
Alice, please.

09:17.874 --> 09:20.277
Please. I'm gonna call somebody...

09:28.301 --> 09:30.440
Yeah, we were pretty close.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.674
When was the last time you saw her?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.615
Saturday night at a party.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.947
And Samantha Williams?

09:40.047 --> 09:43.450
- What about her?
- She's an attractive girl.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.643
I'm going through changes.

09:47.586 --> 09:51.491
- Yeah, I guess so.
- How well did you know her?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.694
Just... friend of a friend.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.630
I need someone that cares.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.996
I care.

09:59.832 --> 10:03.159
You must have really liked
her restaurant a lot?

10:04.953 --> 10:07.838
- You were there a lot, no?
- We would go there sometimes.

10:07.938 --> 10:11.111
It was just a place to hang out.
We all hang... we all hang out there.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.370
Did you and Samantha ever hang out?

10:15.347 --> 10:16.917
- That feel okay?
- Yeah.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.858
God, it tingles.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.379
There's something moving in there.
Oh, my God!

10:23.353 --> 10:24.680
Fuck is wrong with you?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.762
She had a girlfriend.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.364
She dated a bartender
who worked at Toddy's.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.234
Her name was Nikki, I think.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.561
Nikki Peyser. She's dead too.

10:43.509 --> 10:46.670
- Jesus, I didn't know... I didn't know...
- You sure you don't want some tea?

10:49.548 --> 10:50.717
Am I in trouble?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.023
Can you tell me what happened
last Saturday night?

10:53.123 --> 10:54.805
You know what?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.524
I've been over all of this
twice already.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.483
The last guy who came in here,
I told him everything.

11:00.793 --> 11:05.188
Did you see anyone at the party
who was unusual?

11:06.766 --> 11:08.502
<i>No.</i>

11:09.002 --> 11:10.464
<i>No, not that I recall.</i>

11:15.274 --> 11:16.439
We should stop.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.739
We... we were just all there
to have a good time.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.357
Have you seen anyone
who resembles this man?

11:35.411 --> 11:37.144
<i>Who is he?</i>

11:37.244 --> 11:38.782
Have you seen him?

11:38.932 --> 11:42.012
- Yeah, he was at the party.
- With Samantha Williams?

11:58.851 --> 12:00.020
Jesus Christ.

12:00.120 --> 12:04.658
I've got 4 dead bodies...
and 3 missing girls.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.717
I'm just trying
to put the pieces together.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.486
I'm sorry, are we done?

12:19.338 --> 12:20.697
For now.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.703
Fuck!

13:09.889 --> 13:11.581
Yeah.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.295
- What?
- Don't "what" me.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.830
<i>Brenda, this really isn't a good time.</i>

13:16.930 --> 13:20.867
- Well, I've been trying to call you all day.
- Well, I've been a little tied up, Brenda.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.071
- <i>Are you still coming tomorrow?</i>
- To what?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.561
Alice's memorial?

13:27.539 --> 13:30.507
- Right.
- So you're coming then?

13:30.607 --> 13:32.692
A memorial service
isn't gonna bring her back.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.711
Yeah, well...

13:34.811 --> 13:39.266
let's not cry because she's gone...
let's smile because she happened.

13:39.366 --> 13:43.782
- Oh, God. Is that in your new book?
- <i>Fuck off.</i>

13:44.364 --> 13:46.379
Do you like it?

13:48.891 --> 13:50.916
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:51.494 --> 13:54.264
- Wear something nice, okay?
- Yeah.

13:54.364 --> 13:56.222
<i>I love you.</i>

14:12.948 --> 14:14.537
- Hey, grandma.
- Hey.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.287
How you doin'?

14:27.396 --> 14:29.556
Been talking to detectives all day.

14:30.549 --> 14:33.106
I'm sorry about your friends.

14:46.832 --> 14:48.718
Don't be such a pussy.

14:49.686 --> 14:52.411
It'll put hair on your chest.

15:04.233 --> 15:07.063
Never gets any easier.

15:08.537 --> 15:11.386
Burying your friends.

15:12.808 --> 15:14.767
Your family.

15:18.263 --> 15:20.260
When my Harold died...

15:21.184 --> 15:23.253
I didn't know, you know?

15:23.353 --> 15:28.016
I just didn't see any point in...
going on.

15:32.962 --> 15:35.398
But then I decided to stay.

15:35.498 --> 15:38.357
For your mom and for you.

15:40.235 --> 15:42.501
And I'm glad I did.

15:48.177 --> 15:50.036
Thank you.

16:27.016 --> 16:29.313
Detective Young, please.

16:37.327 --> 16:40.163
<i>Unit needed at the intersection
of Victory and Van Nuys.</i>

16:40.863 --> 16:44.486

- <i>Copy, cruiser 216.</i>

16:49.972 --> 16:53.885
Hey, what's the deal with those...
air fresheners, anyways?

16:59.248 --> 17:02.074
Alright, you're fucking weird.

17:07.021 --> 17:09.080
That's 200.

17:17.232 --> 17:19.125
Asshole.

17:26.775 --> 17:28.566
This is not $200.

17:31.197 --> 17:35.095
<i>Officers, we have a lookout
for California plate 1 Bravo 8-9-6-1-4,</i>

17:35.195 --> 17:37.003

19:06.608 --> 19:08.668
Good morning.

19:10.445 --> 19:12.338
Shoes.

19:16.118 --> 19:18.468
It's freezing in here.

19:20.622 --> 19:22.844
You feel okay?

19:24.793 --> 19:26.485
Yeah.

21:07.796 --> 21:11.041
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

21:12.357 --> 21:16.923
<i>Police are still looking for a connection
between the brutal murders of 4 women.</i>

21:17.023 --> 21:21.867

Hey, Harper.

21:40.997 --> 21:44.067
Hi. I just heard.

21:44.167 --> 21:47.560
- How are you?
- I'm alright.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.440
Let me help you with that.

21:53.342 --> 21:58.181
- How's Margie?
- Margie is still kickin' ass.

21:58.281 --> 22:01.907
That is some cold sore you've got there.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.212
Come take a seat,
let me take care of that.

22:10.826 --> 22:13.736
Hello? Oh, excuse me.

22:13.836 --> 22:15.038
James.

22:16.865 --> 22:19.736
What did you do to yourself?

22:19.836 --> 22:22.161
You really wanna know?

22:24.139 --> 22:26.409
Alright, talk to me.

22:26.509 --> 22:28.501
- <i>The test results are in.</i>
- And?

22:32.714 --> 22:34.673
You're clean.

22:35.684 --> 22:38.521
Fuck. You sure?

22:38.621 --> 22:41.227
Yeah, I mean, we'll have
to check back in a few months but...

22:41.327 --> 22:43.515
yeah, you're clean as a whistle.

22:43.692 --> 22:44.961
I could kiss you right now.

22:45.461 --> 22:46.891
Yeah, please don't.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.824
We didn't... we didn't thoroughly
check you for mouth AIDS, so...

22:53.002 --> 22:55.605
Listen, I really appreciate this.
I fucking owe you one, man.

22:55.705 --> 23:00.833
<i>Yeah, no... no problem. Just be glad
you don't have what Samantha had, God.</i>

23:01.709 --> 23:03.079
Why? What'd she have?

23:03.179 --> 23:07.283
Well, they're not really telling me much
but my buddy over at the coroners office

23:07.383 --> 23:12.753
said it's some kind of necrotic STD,
it's really gnarly shit.

23:14.856 --> 23:17.950
- Shit.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

23:18.627 --> 23:21.564
- Wait, you didn't fuck her, did you?
- Wha... no... what? No.

23:21.664 --> 23:25.168
Okay, good. Alright, man, well... you know
let me know if anything changes and...

23:25.268 --> 23:28.070
- Yeah, sure.
- <i>Yeah, just call me, okay?</i>

23:28.170 --> 23:30.329
I'll see you tonight.

23:43.084 --> 23:44.543
Everything alright?

23:46.488 --> 23:49.048
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

23:50.558 --> 23:52.549
Just thinkin' about...

23:52.649 --> 23:55.765
about everything, about Alice
and Samantha and...

23:55.865 --> 23:59.602
then I've got the memorial thing tonight
and I just don't know if I have it in me.

23:59.702 --> 24:01.938
Why don't you two... go together?

24:02.038 --> 24:06.732
Oh, that's a really good idea, grandma,
but it's not really a fun thing. Trust me.

24:07.142 --> 24:09.702
I don't have any plans tonight.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.249
Yeah, sure.

24:13.349 --> 24:17.110
- Okay. Pick me up on your way?
- Okay.

24:28.363 --> 24:30.466
What you deserve is disease.

24:30.566 --> 24:33.269
What you deserve is plague.

24:33.369 --> 24:38.675
All the people around you, your sons
and daughters your brothers and sisters,

24:38.775 --> 24:43.713
their bodies stacked around you
like firewood leaking blood and pus.

24:43.813 --> 24:47.206
All the physical that you held so dear.

24:48.583 --> 24:51.387
Everything that turned you on...

24:51.487 --> 24:55.814
now rotted and stinking
from the very... Quiet!

25:00.194 --> 25:02.529
Abaddon is coming.

25:29.058 --> 25:31.617
Hey, Debbie, come on in.

25:32.927 --> 25:35.531
- You know you're late, right?
- I'm sorry.

25:35.631 --> 25:38.500
- And you missed last week's session.
- I know, I'm sorry.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.694
No, don't apologize to me,
just tell me what's up.

25:45.374 --> 25:48.190
Look, I know withdrawal can be difficult
but you have to start taking

25:48.290 --> 25:51.146
- these sessions seriously.
- I know, I know.

25:51.246 --> 25:54.206
I can't help you
unless you wanna be helped.

25:56.085 --> 25:58.544
You can talk to me. I won't be upset.

26:00.004 --> 26:02.731
Debbie, look at me, are you using again?

26:03.658 --> 26:05.227
Are you?

26:05.327 --> 26:07.019
No.

26:07.929 --> 26:11.200
- It's under my skin.
- What do you mean it's under your skin?

26:11.300 --> 26:13.770
It's under my skin.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.505
- Debbie, don't do that...
- It won't stop.

26:16.605 --> 26:19.665
- Don't do that, Debbie, look at me.
- It won't stop.

26:20.943 --> 26:22.378
Debbie, look at me, stop.

26:22.478 --> 26:25.037
- It won't stop.
- Ricky!

26:25.847 --> 26:27.315
Ricky!

26:27.415 --> 26:31.053
- Oh, hell no.
- Ricky! Ricky, what the fuck?

26:31.153 --> 26:34.580
Won't stop, it won't stop.

27:06.855 --> 27:09.926
I'm so sorry for your loss. Sorry.

27:10.526 --> 27:13.135
Yeah, it's tough.

27:13.235 --> 27:15.264
I mean, she was cool.

27:15.364 --> 27:17.600
I just think it's tacky.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.502
How can you say that?
All of her friends are here.

27:19.602 --> 27:21.404
- Exactly.
- It's a celebration of her life.

27:21.504 --> 27:24.106
- With your book?
- I think... I'm dedicating it.

27:24.206 --> 27:26.308
You know, I just feel like
it's the most...

27:26.408 --> 27:27.743
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:27.843 --> 27:28.878
- Harper.
- I'm... James.

27:28.978 --> 27:30.646
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

27:30.746 --> 27:31.714
Hey, bud.

27:31.814 --> 27:35.751
- You look nice, and you must be...
- Harper, hi.

27:35.851 --> 27:38.020
Brenda, Riley's sister.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.022
You look great.

27:40.122 --> 27:44.416
- How far along are you?
- Oh, 8 and a half months.

27:44.726 --> 27:46.729
I love your dress.

27:46.829 --> 27:50.299
I've never had the confidence
to wear something so tight.

27:50.699 --> 27:52.802
You know, I didn't know
that Riley was seeing anyone.

27:52.902 --> 27:54.470
Oh, oh, we're not...

27:54.570 --> 27:57.907
Oh, so you guys are... just friends?

27:58.007 --> 28:00.199
- Brenda.
- What?

28:02.110 --> 28:04.766
Just use a condom next time.

28:06.781 --> 28:10.742
It was great to meet you.
And I'm really glad you're here.

28:13.321 --> 28:15.691
I'm gonna grab another drink.

28:15.791 --> 28:18.060
I think I'll join you.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.870
James...

28:50.192 --> 28:53.485
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:57.999 --> 29:01.704
We are here today... to mourn Alice.

29:01.804 --> 29:04.373
To... remember her life

29:04.473 --> 29:06.909
and to celebrate her.

29:07.009 --> 29:09.378
She was a woman who...

29:09.478 --> 29:12.248
made everybody smile.

29:12.348 --> 29:13.995
And I know that as her friends,

29:14.095 --> 29:17.709
she would want us to celebrate
the life that we have left.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.856
And that's why...

29:20.956 --> 29:24.082
I've decided to dedicate my new book...

29:26.394 --> 29:29.932
"A Better You, Change From Within..."

29:30.032 --> 29:31.873
to Alice's memory.

29:31.973 --> 29:33.825
Unbelievable.

29:37.071 --> 29:42.000
And now, if you'd like to gather around,
Dewey's written a song in her honor.

29:55.957 --> 29:58.206
This is excruciating.

30:51.646 --> 30:53.872
I... I gotta... I gotta...

31:04.759 --> 31:06.418
Fuck.

31:18.206 --> 31:21.433
Oh, God, no. Oh, God, no.

31:22.761 --> 31:24.403
Fuck.

31:40.895 --> 31:43.365
That was beautiful.
Wasn't that beautiful?

31:43.465 --> 31:45.101
Yeah, it was somethin'.

31:53.107 --> 31:54.653
I was so hungry.

31:56.879 --> 31:58.013
- Riley?
- Yeah.

31:58.113 --> 32:03.085
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just... just allergies.

32:03.285 --> 32:06.945
If you're not feeling well we can...
we can take off.

32:08.022 --> 32:11.560
- Wanna grab a drink or something?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.619
Yeah, yeah, let's get out of here.

34:45.413 --> 34:46.782
It was beautiful.

34:46.882 --> 34:49.270
- Do you think it's on iTunes yet, or...
- Yeah.

34:51.716 --> 34:53.571
Happy occasion.

34:53.670 --> 34:56.190
- My sister is...
- A bitch?

34:56.291 --> 34:57.449
Yes.

35:00.695 --> 35:02.564
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

35:02.664 --> 35:05.423
It's easy. She's...

35:05.800 --> 35:07.603
She's fun, you know?

35:07.703 --> 35:10.428
- Yeah.
- I like being around her.

35:15.976 --> 35:19.182
Honestly, I think Margie's been looking
for an excuse to set us up for a while.

35:19.982 --> 35:22.607
She's an interesting woman, isn't she?

35:22.918 --> 35:24.676
Cheers.

35:37.765 --> 35:40.001
Do you wanna hear a joke?

35:40.101 --> 35:41.269
Yeah.

35:41.369 --> 35:44.806
Okay. A guy walks into a bar.

35:44.906 --> 35:48.577
And he says to the bartender,
"Give me ten shots."

35:48.677 --> 35:51.680
And the bartender says, "Ten shots?

35:51.780 --> 35:55.083
You really, really want ten shots, dude?"
And the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:55.183 --> 35:57.953
"You know, you'd want ten shots too
if you had what I have."

35:58.053 --> 36:01.791
So the bartender sets up ten shots.

36:02.291 --> 36:05.060
Guy throws back all ten of 'em.

36:05.160 --> 36:09.631
The bartender leans in and he says,
"I gotta ask, man. What do you have?"

36:09.731 --> 36:13.258
And the guy says "75 cents."

36:16.104 --> 36:18.163
That's good.

36:27.014 --> 36:28.873
I'll be right back.

37:09.523 --> 37:11.850
Should we get you something?

37:27.441 --> 37:28.578
Sorry.

37:29.578 --> 37:31.347
He's had a few too many.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.300
Next one's on me.

38:57.365 --> 39:01.003
Riley, Riley, Riley.
I've been watching you.

39:01.703 --> 39:04.339
You and I have a relationship now.

39:04.439 --> 39:06.274
I gave it to Sam.

39:06.374 --> 39:08.410
My own little Typhoid Mary.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.579
Sam gave it to you.

39:10.679 --> 39:13.281
Part of me is flowing through you.

39:13.381 --> 39:17.475
And you are testing my patience.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.508
Relax, we just started talking.

39:22.791 --> 39:25.293
I never get to talk to anybody.

40:11.673 --> 40:14.324
Please go back, ma'am,
or I'll fucking shoot you.

40:28.722 --> 40:30.563
No idea what's about to happen.

40:31.726 --> 40:34.070
You don't have much time left.

40:34.170 --> 40:37.866
And you have so much to lose.

40:38.266 --> 40:42.560
Sleep tight, Riley. We'll be seeing
each other again soon enough.

41:19.473 --> 41:21.843
Hey, this is Riley,
I'm not feelin' 100% today.

41:21.943 --> 41:24.846
Sorry for not calling earlier.
I don't think I'm gonna make it in.

41:24.946 --> 41:27.772
Alright. Bye.

41:51.239 --> 41:52.541
Oh, fuck!

41:52.641 --> 41:55.299
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

42:00.080 --> 42:03.507
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

42:24.304 --> 42:26.531
Oh, my God.

43:14.588 --> 43:18.994
<i>The CDC has called for a complete quarantine
on the Petrino Memorial Hospital.</i>

43:19.094 --> 43:23.565
<i>They are asking for anyone experiencing
flu like symptoms or redness of the eyes</i>

43:23.865 --> 43:26.034
<i>to immediately seek medical attention.</i>

43:26.434 --> 43:29.270
<i>Anonymous sources say this is connected
to the shocking events...</i>

43:29.370 --> 43:31.939
- Love you, grandma.
- <i>surrounding Samantha Williams...</i>

43:32.039 --> 43:32.941
Gotta run.

43:33.041 --> 43:35.510
<i>The police did, however conduct
a raid on Jaffe's house</i>

43:35.610 --> 43:40.004
<i>finding a gruesome discovery
of several decomposed women.</i>

43:52.092 --> 43:54.496
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

43:54.596 --> 43:56.707
Harper, this is Riley.

43:56.807 --> 43:59.734
Look, I'm really sorry about last night
but some shit has hit the fan.

43:59.834 --> 44:01.402
I need you to call me back.

44:03.904 --> 44:07.175
Fuck! James, it's Riley, listen.

44:07.275 --> 44:10.058
I need you to call me back.
Whatever you do, don't leave the house.

44:10.158 --> 44:12.570
Just call me back, okay?
I'll explain everything.

44:18.953 --> 44:20.097
Brenda?

44:20.921 --> 44:22.580
Shit.

44:28.396 --> 44:30.087
Brenda.

44:35.169 --> 44:37.906
- Jesus!
- Oh, God. What the fuck?

44:38.006 --> 44:40.208
I called you, like, te... sorry.

44:40.308 --> 44:44.345
- I called you like ten times.
- What the fuck? What do you want?

44:44.445 --> 44:46.548
Well, I just, I need to talk
to you for a second.

44:46.648 --> 44:48.449
Yeah, well, give me a minute, alright?

44:48.549 --> 44:53.511
Yeah, I didn't...
didn't mean to interrupt.

44:57.491 --> 45:01.283
It is my day off. Do you have
any idea how fucking rare that is?

45:06.433 --> 45:08.503
We need to get you
to the hospital right now.

45:08.603 --> 45:11.005
No. No, no, no, no, no. Not yet.

45:11.105 --> 45:14.242
No, no, no, yes, yes, everyone
who was in quarantine is dead now.

45:14.342 --> 45:15.410
Do you understand what I'm saying?

45:15.510 --> 45:18.603
Yeah, I understand,
look at my fucking face.

45:19.012 --> 45:21.449
Listen, there's this guy named BJ

45:21.549 --> 45:24.719
and I think he's the one that killed Alice
and Samantha and now he is after me.

45:24.819 --> 45:26.287
- No, no...
- We are all in danger.

45:26.387 --> 45:29.090
- We need to take you to the hospital.
- No.

45:29.190 --> 45:33.361
- No, no... Just come with...
- Just lock your door, okay?

45:33.761 --> 45:35.720
I'll come back.

45:49.443 --> 45:51.435
Detective Young?

45:52.346 --> 45:54.749
Special Agent Dalton, CBD.

45:54.849 --> 45:57.486
Chemical Biological Defense,
Homeland Security.

45:57.986 --> 45:59.636
I have something you need to hear.

46:02.489 --> 46:05.393
<i>Mankind is a bacteria</i>

46:05.493 --> 46:08.063
<i>that needs to be obliterated.</i>

46:08.163 --> 46:13.201
<i>Locusts will tear at your flesh
and chew on your bones.</i>

46:13.301 --> 46:16.738
<i>A new beginning, an eternal night,</i>

46:16.838 --> 46:20.508
<i>wrath like never before
cleansing society</i>

46:20.608 --> 46:22.744
<i>and all I ever wanted was to feel.</i>

46:22.844 --> 46:27.448
<i>To feel anything, pain, love, anger.</i>

46:27.548 --> 46:31.152
<i>I am death. I am disease.</i>

46:31.252 --> 46:32.420
<i>I am the end.</i>

46:32.520 --> 46:34.088
- Fuck.
- <i>I am death.</i>

46:34.188 --> 46:35.757
<i>I am disease.</i>

46:35.857 --> 46:38.201
<i>I am the end. I am...</i>

46:39.527 --> 46:43.364
The Bureau started getting threats
from Jaffe a little over a year ago.

46:43.464 --> 46:47.202
He was just a nut job at first
then he started sending a tape a day.

46:47.302 --> 46:49.003
My God.

46:49.103 --> 46:52.540
His threat level went from elevated
to sociopath.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.276
- Why is the government involved in this?
- Because last month

46:55.376 --> 46:59.280
he was a run of the mill sociopath,
now he's a threat to national defense.

46:59.380 --> 47:00.548
So he's planning an attack?

47:00.648 --> 47:03.118
He's way past planning
we're trying to contain it.

47:03.218 --> 47:06.654
- Contain what?
- A highly contagious viral pathogen.

47:06.754 --> 47:09.624
A 100% mortality rate.
Beyond that, we have no fucking idea.

47:09.724 --> 47:11.960
Okay, so you're saying
he's spreading a disease?

47:12.060 --> 47:14.552
No. I'm saying he is the disease.

47:33.648 --> 47:35.684
Oh, shit.

47:39.152 --> 47:42.429
Let us know if something comes up.

47:44.591 --> 47:46.561
- Detective Young.
- Yeah.

47:46.961 --> 47:48.688
We need him alive.

47:49.464 --> 47:50.673
You got it.

48:12.753 --> 48:17.315
Hi. The... rubbing alcohol, please?

48:23.279 --> 48:25.139
Sewing kit?

48:26.733 --> 48:28.869
The... lighter.

48:28.969 --> 48:30.028
Lighter.

48:31.171 --> 48:34.632
And... and a box cutter.

48:37.344 --> 48:40.080
Yeah, that's the one.

48:40.180 --> 48:41.400
Anything else?

48:42.350 --> 48:43.641
Do you have any whiskey?

48:44.718 --> 48:46.788
- What kind?
- Any kind will do.

48:46.888 --> 48:49.009
Just any kind of whiskey.

48:52.526 --> 48:56.253
- How about this?
- That's great.

48:57.564 --> 48:58.951
Are you alright, son?

49:07.207 --> 49:08.899
Allergies.

49:09.376 --> 49:11.579
And where's your bathroom?

49:11.679 --> 49:13.671
It's around back.

49:51.585 --> 49:54.812
Oh, fuck.

51:12.732 --> 51:14.893
Come on, fucking come out!

51:19.039 --> 51:21.346
Just come out!

51:28.448 --> 51:30.589
Got you, bitch!

51:57.544 --> 52:00.473
<i>You have reached Margie McCormick.
You know what to do.</i>

52:03.416 --> 52:05.142
Fuck!

52:06.419 --> 52:08.012
Fuck.

52:11.324 --> 52:14.095
Detective Young, this is Riley. Listen,
I need you to go to my house right now.

52:14.195 --> 52:18.332
I think my grandmother might be in danger.
BJ found me last night and he is after me.

52:18.432 --> 52:20.685
I need you to go to my house,
call me back.

52:21.535 --> 52:25.172
I know today we were gonna be talking about
how nature maps amino acids into proteins

52:25.272 --> 52:27.675
but we're gonna have
a pop quiz on chapter 8

52:27.775 --> 52:30.135
which was the reproductive system
of the bonobo monkey.

52:35.483 --> 52:37.508
And the reason...

52:52.532 --> 52:54.869
What are you doing here?

52:54.969 --> 52:58.873
- I came to see you, are you okay?
- I'm in the middle of class.

52:58.973 --> 53:01.509
I mean, are you feeling sick?

53:02.009 --> 53:05.279
I'm fine. What happened last night?

53:05.379 --> 53:08.382
Oh, my God, your eyes. You're infected.

53:08.482 --> 53:11.018
I slept with my contacts in.

53:11.118 --> 53:15.074
- Really, I'm fine.
- No. No, you are not fine.

53:15.574 --> 53:17.349
Listen, you have to come
with me right now.

53:17.449 --> 53:20.198
- What is going on?
- Do you trust me?

53:20.298 --> 53:23.998
Of course I trust you.
But you're acting like a fucking lunatic.

53:24.098 --> 53:26.668
What did you do to your face?

53:27.068 --> 53:30.438
I will explain everything to you
but I need you to come with me right now.

53:30.538 --> 53:33.024
No, not when you're acting like this!

53:33.374 --> 53:35.176
Harper, you know this guy?

53:35.276 --> 53:37.916
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's fine.

53:40.613 --> 53:42.783
Harper. Let's go.

53:42.883 --> 53:44.785
Come on, bro,
she's not going with you anywhere.

53:44.885 --> 53:46.420
Get your fucking hand off me.

53:46.520 --> 53:49.891
Dude, just piss off or else
it's gonna get a little ugly.

53:50.691 --> 53:53.594
It's already ugly, bro. And why don't
you mind your own fucking business?

53:53.694 --> 53:56.210
Guys, stop!

54:00.633 --> 54:02.859
Come on, let's go.

54:04.003 --> 54:05.220
The hell?

54:10.343 --> 54:14.048
- What the fuck is going on?
- The guy that the cops are after...

54:14.148 --> 54:16.684
- I saw him raping Samantha.
- Oh, my God.

54:16.784 --> 54:19.720
I saw him raping Samantha and I just
stood there, I didn't do anything about it.

54:19.820 --> 54:21.512
I'm a piece of shit.

54:22.288 --> 54:25.826
He saw me.
I got his license plate number.

54:25.926 --> 54:28.796
And I gave it to the cops
and now he wants me dead.

54:28.896 --> 54:32.533
He drugged me at the bar last night
and that guy is fucking out of his mind.

54:33.033 --> 54:36.836
He threatened me,
he threatened my family, you.

54:36.936 --> 54:39.196
What's happening to us?

54:40.306 --> 54:44.545
BJ infected Samantha, Samantha
infected me and now we're both sick.

54:44.645 --> 54:46.987
But we never...

54:48.848 --> 54:51.074
Oh, my God!

54:51.418 --> 54:54.612
- I kissed you.
- Yeah.

54:56.956 --> 54:58.326
It's my fault.

54:58.726 --> 55:01.462
Look, I would take you to the hospital
but they're quarantining everybody.

55:01.562 --> 55:03.664
No one's getting out of there.

55:03.764 --> 55:06.023
We gotta find BJ.

55:06.599 --> 55:09.096
If we find him, he might have a cure
he's not showing any of the symptoms

55:09.196 --> 55:11.868
or signs of whatever this thing is.

55:23.049 --> 55:25.145
Mrs. McCormick?

55:34.094 --> 55:35.953
Is everything okay?

55:39.566 --> 55:41.825
Mrs. McCormick?

55:45.905 --> 55:47.998
Mrs. McCormick?

55:53.613 --> 55:55.905
Oh, no. What is that?

56:07.428 --> 56:11.489
Mrs. McCormick? It's the police.
Your grandson sent us to check on you.

56:24.511 --> 56:26.770
What the fuck?

56:35.055 --> 56:37.892
Do not move. If you move, I'm gonna
shoot you! Do you understand me?

56:38.892 --> 56:40.026
Freeze!

56:43.796 --> 56:45.364
Oh, fuck!

56:50.504 --> 56:52.205
Shit.

56:52.305 --> 56:54.431
Oh, God.

56:55.608 --> 56:59.436
I know, I know. Almost done.

57:09.255 --> 57:12.493
I'm worried about my grandmother.
She never answered the phone.

57:12.593 --> 57:14.521
Margie's gonna be fine.

57:14.862 --> 57:16.853
She's tough.

57:17.987 --> 57:19.839
Yeah, she is.

57:21.301 --> 57:23.671
- Fuck.
- What?

57:23.771 --> 57:26.473
My eye is just killing me.

57:26.573 --> 57:28.709
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57:28.809 --> 57:32.263
- I'm gonna go take my contacts out.
- Alright.

57:40.353 --> 57:42.379
Oh, my God.

57:52.265 --> 57:54.068
- Detective Young?
- <i>Riley, don't hang up.</i>

57:54.168 --> 57:56.469
<i>It's about your grandmother.</i>

57:57.737 --> 58:00.140
<i>She's dead, Riley.</i>

58:00.240 --> 58:02.632
<i>She was infected.</i>

58:03.342 --> 58:07.605
<i>I know BJ was behind this. You need
to tell us everything you know.</i>

58:09.215 --> 58:11.675
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

58:13.820 --> 58:16.112
<i>Are you sick too?</i>

58:50.356 --> 58:52.015
Harper?

58:56.028 --> 58:57.887
What happened?

58:59.532 --> 59:01.591
My eye.

59:08.574 --> 59:12.136
- I'm sorry.
- What did you do to me?

59:14.283 --> 59:17.833
I didn't start this but I'm gonna
get the guy who did.

59:22.622 --> 59:25.726
Hey, sis, it's me.
I just wanted to give you a quick call.

59:26.126 --> 59:28.929
I just really appreciate everything
that you've ever...

59:29.029 --> 59:30.541
that you've ever done for me.

59:31.665 --> 59:33.133
I just wanted you to know

59:33.233 --> 59:36.478
that I think you're gonna make
a really, really great mother.

59:37.937 --> 59:39.663
And...

59:40.840 --> 59:43.594
just go easy on the little guy, okay?

59:46.412 --> 59:49.116
This might be the last time
you ever hear from me.

59:49.216 --> 59:52.609
I love you so much. And...

59:54.787 --> 59:56.847
I love you.

01:00:01.594 --> 01:00:04.297
Hey, man. What the fuck happened to you?

01:00:04.397 --> 01:00:06.033
We're in some trouble,
we need some help.

01:00:06.133 --> 01:00:09.585
Sure, like... you need a ride or something?
To the emergency room?

01:00:09.685 --> 01:00:11.928
No, no, something else.

01:00:18.027 --> 01:00:20.555
I'll be honest, you are the last person
I expected to see here,

01:00:20.655 --> 01:00:23.183
and Riley I don't wanna make
a big deal about it, but...

01:00:23.283 --> 01:00:27.677
you and your friend look like fucking shit.
What's up? I'm Zain, by the way.

01:00:28.571 --> 01:00:31.442
So what're you looking for?
OCs, Vikes, what's up?

01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:34.094
- I need a gun.
- Fucking guns, bro?

01:00:34.194 --> 01:00:37.598
Do I look like Ted-Fucking-Nugent?
Don't answer that.

01:00:37.698 --> 01:00:40.701
Dude, I sell fucking
recreational shit here, okay?

01:00:40.801 --> 01:00:45.795
I sell good times, I help people
and I don't fucking kill them, okay?

01:00:49.408 --> 01:00:50.686
How much cash you got?

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:57.040
Alright, I got a .45, .357, 12 gauge,
if you wanna get all John Woo and shit.

01:00:57.483 --> 01:01:01.221
Twins. It's a 100 for the pistols
and 200 for the shotgun

01:01:01.321 --> 01:01:04.022
and I'll throw in an extra clip
and two boxes of rounds

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:05.921
just 'cause, you know, we're friends.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.495
You ever shot
one of those things before?

01:01:08.595 --> 01:01:10.297
No.

01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:14.015
- But I've seen lots of movies.
- Oh, okay.

01:01:14.115 --> 01:01:16.927
So... 200?

01:01:18.204 --> 01:01:21.588
150? Can't go any lower than 150, sorry.

01:01:27.446 --> 01:01:28.836
You know this guy, right?

01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:34.788
Alright. Zain, this doesn't have
to get ugly, alright?

01:01:34.888 --> 01:01:38.582
I don't want you to fuck with me, I just
want you to tell me where does he live.

01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:41.895
Just tell me.

01:01:41.995 --> 01:01:44.640
Dude... I sell a lot of fucking drugs
to a lot of fucking people,

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.201
I don't know where they all live.
I don't even know where my mother lives.

01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:50.971
I need you to stop bullshitting me, Zain,
this guy is fucking dangerous.

01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:53.407
Dude... dude, relax.

01:01:53.507 --> 01:01:57.367
You invited him to that party
now you tell me where he is.

01:01:58.245 --> 01:02:00.003
Dude.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.918
I'm running out of time here. I need you
to tell me where he lives, Zain.

01:02:05.018 --> 01:02:07.521
You need to get to a fucking hospital.

01:02:07.621 --> 01:02:11.082
I'm already fucking dead
and I'm taking him with me.

01:02:16.562 --> 01:02:17.830
What're we gonna do?

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.937
- Drop the weapon!
- Fuck!

01:02:23.037 --> 01:02:25.239
Get down on the ground,
put your hands up.

01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:27.451
- Get on the ground!
- Right now!

01:02:32.312 --> 01:02:34.934
I need an emergency
medical team here immediately.

01:02:46.827 --> 01:02:48.962
Will you tell me what's wrong?

01:02:49.062 --> 01:02:51.365
Riley! Riley! Riley!

01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:53.761
Riley, what's happening?

01:02:54.234 --> 01:02:56.003
What's...

01:02:56.403 --> 01:02:58.205
- Harper.
- She's seizing.

01:02:58.305 --> 01:03:00.524
Harper! Harper.

01:03:00.624 --> 01:03:02.883
Where are you taking her?

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:12.162
Losing her, losing her.

01:03:13.986 --> 01:03:15.392
Get oxygen.

01:03:18.657 --> 01:03:20.717
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:03:21.194 --> 01:03:25.148
- Come on, honey, hang in there.
- Alright, paddles. Paddles.

01:03:25.248 --> 01:03:26.771
Everyone clear!

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:35.317
She's gone.

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.116
We'll take it from here.

01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:14.638
Hi. Hey.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.060
Where's Harper?

01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:37.870
There's 37 new cases since this morning.

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:39.940
It's spreading.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.217
I really need your help.

01:04:44.076 --> 01:04:46.503
I need to know everything
that you know about him.

01:04:55.121 --> 01:04:57.365
Hello, Riley McCormick's room, please.

01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:01.261
I'm done.

01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:02.929
It's too late.

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:06.189
- It's not too late.
- It's too late.

01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:10.861
- 427, first room on the left.
- Thank you.

01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:14.598
Please just tell me.

01:05:15.341 --> 01:05:17.366
He's a maniac.

01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:19.613
Look what's happening out there...

01:05:19.713 --> 01:05:21.682
- Detective.
- Yeah.

01:05:21.782 --> 01:05:24.496
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

01:05:27.553 --> 01:05:29.645
Don't move.

01:05:30.923 --> 01:05:34.411
It's okay, go ahead.
Just go, it's okay, I'll be alright.

01:05:37.496 --> 01:05:38.732
Yeah.

01:05:38.832 --> 01:05:41.418
- Got a 10-33... are you feeling okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:41.518 --> 01:05:45.105
Got a 10-33. We're undermanned.
Radio's going crazy.

01:05:45.205 --> 01:05:47.808
We're gonna respond,
we got some other units on the way.

01:05:47.908 --> 01:05:49.175
- You gonna be alright if we...
- Yeah.

01:05:49.275 --> 01:05:51.367
- ...here for a little bit?
- Yeah.

01:05:51.467 --> 01:05:53.102
Right.

01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:19.729
Don't.

01:06:21.507 --> 01:06:23.433
You look amazing.

01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:28.915
- I'm proud of you, Riley.
- Bastard.

01:06:29.015 --> 01:06:30.817
You've done so well.

01:06:31.017 --> 01:06:32.776
But...

01:06:32.876 --> 01:06:35.746
I think it's time that we
escalate things, don't you?

01:06:42.328 --> 01:06:44.516
You're a real son of a bitch,
you know that?

01:06:45.966 --> 01:06:49.855
- Don't fucking move.
- Crystal, put down the gun!

01:06:52.805 --> 01:06:56.396
<i>Dr. Morris, dial 182, please.</i>

01:06:57.243 --> 01:06:59.079
Don't fucking move.

01:06:59.179 --> 01:07:02.149
Don't you touch that,
don't you touch that. Shit!

01:07:02.249 --> 01:07:05.218
There's a lot of sick people
in this building.

01:07:05.318 --> 01:07:08.021
Be a shame if something
happened to them.

01:07:08.121 --> 01:07:10.079
Shit.

01:07:11.056 --> 01:07:14.094
No one move.
Everyone stay where you are.

01:07:14.494 --> 01:07:16.396
Fuck. Fuck.

01:07:16.796 --> 01:07:19.133
Everything will be fine eventually.

01:07:19.833 --> 01:07:23.136
- I'll kill you.
- You're not gonna kill me, detective.

01:07:23.236 --> 01:07:25.272
I'm the only thing that can save you.

01:07:25.372 --> 01:07:27.774
Do you ever feel like the Egyptians?

01:07:27.874 --> 01:07:30.944
Powerless as the wrath of God...

01:07:31.044 --> 01:07:34.009
is crashing down around your head.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.474
- Get on the fucking ground.
- The end is here.

01:08:15.154 --> 01:08:16.578
Goodbye, Detective Young.

01:08:33.072 --> 01:08:34.782
The fuck?

01:08:39.845 --> 01:08:41.776
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:48.540
Motherfucker.

01:09:06.404 --> 01:09:10.198
- I'm gonna fucking murder you.
- Not in this lifetime.

01:09:59.124 --> 01:10:01.017
I'm the end.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.132
Bren?

01:10:54.446 --> 01:10:56.139
Brenda?

01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:52.054
Hello, Brent.

01:12:53.115 --> 01:12:55.136
How're you feeling?

01:12:59.638 --> 01:13:01.864
Soon, my friend.

01:13:02.891 --> 01:13:04.784
Very soon.
