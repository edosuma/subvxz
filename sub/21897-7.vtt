Over here will be the site of
what will be Ballarat's first vineyard.

00:33.765 --> 00:35.539
I bought this whole farm

00:35.606 --> 00:37.566
just for that one paddock,
past those trees there.

00:37.651 --> 00:40.760
One perfect run of soil,
just for grape growing.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.419
I thought
we were out here for a story.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.715
I wanted to surprise you.

00:43.791 --> 00:46.330
Ah, Daryl.
G'day, Edward. Good to see you.

00:46.486 --> 00:47.924
And who's this lovely young lady?

00:48.010 --> 00:49.283
This is Rose.

00:49.362 --> 00:50.374
Anderson.

00:50.432 --> 00:52.120
I work for The Courier.
A pleasure.

00:52.221 --> 00:54.507
Can I get the wife
to get you a beer or something?

00:54.565 --> 00:56.605
Ah, in the boot,
there's a picnic basket.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.325
You can fetch that.

01:00.752 --> 01:04.315
Kev! Make yourself useful.

01:06.996 --> 01:08.484
Excuse me, Miss.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.296
Oh no, let me help.
I've got it.

01:10.492 --> 01:12.890
Better hurry. I think
your fella's up there waiting.

01:53.131 --> 01:54.796
Yeah, yeah, righto.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.092
Dad!

Kevin!

02:49.893 --> 02:51.334
Oh, thank God.

02:54.486 --> 02:56.245
Have you seen your dad anywhere?

02:56.511 --> 02:59.761
No, I thought he was over
with Scotty and that crew.

02:59.966 --> 03:01.933
They haven't seen him anywhere.

03:03.849 --> 03:05.136
I'll go grab him.

04:24.205 --> 04:26.901
- What time did you get up?
- Just after dawn.

04:29.805 --> 04:31.738
6:00? I didn't have my watch on.

04:31.844 --> 04:33.308
And whereabouts was it?

04:36.003 --> 04:39.237
- So, just after dawn.
- Yeah.

04:39.381 --> 04:41.190
And whereabouts
did you discover him?

04:41.275 --> 04:44.495
Down by the river. The dogs.
Followed the dogs.

04:46.237 --> 04:47.448
Charlie.

04:47.645 --> 04:50.658
Doc. This is Kevin Fitzpatrick.

04:50.815 --> 04:53.237
He found his father Daryl
about an hour ago.

04:54.432 --> 04:56.714
I am so very sorry
for your loss.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.058
He's out here. I'll show you.

05:26.253 --> 05:29.125
- It's still loaded.
- Right.

05:35.451 --> 05:38.823
Gunshot wound to the neck.
Brutal.

05:39.925 --> 05:41.645
Shotgun, I'd say.

05:43.862 --> 05:46.112
Fired at close range.

05:46.406 --> 05:48.299
Ned, the son made the discovery

05:48.366 --> 05:50.761
and the body was in this position,
yes?

05:51.648 --> 05:52.889
Why?

05:55.406 --> 05:57.165
Hold that thought, Charlie.

06:07.005 --> 06:09.138
Never seen one quite like it.

06:09.308 --> 06:11.179
The wad hasn't entered the wound,

06:11.246 --> 06:12.800
which means
there was some separation

06:12.858 --> 06:14.034
between him and the shooter.

06:14.092 --> 06:15.094
Yes.

06:15.152 --> 06:17.433
- You found it...?
- By the body.

06:17.966 --> 06:21.004
This isn't your first
shotgun homicide, is it?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.546
No, my fourth. You?

06:24.565 --> 06:26.003
My third.

06:27.237 --> 06:30.542
So, the wad has exited
and fallen as the shot spread.

06:30.617 --> 06:31.804
Yes.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.387
I'd say our shooter
was only a few yards away

06:34.445 --> 06:35.764
when they pulled the trigger.

06:35.831 --> 06:37.724
You can tell
by the pellet defects here.

06:37.791 --> 06:41.179
Which means the wad injury
should be...

06:41.308 --> 06:44.808
Somewhere below the main pellet
wounds, yes, thank you, Alice.

06:45.417 --> 06:48.018
Multiple pellet wounds to the neck.

06:48.285 --> 06:50.026
Shattered clavicle.

06:51.065 --> 06:52.605
Cause of death?

06:52.672 --> 06:54.573
Well, goodness me.

06:54.925 --> 06:57.285
Catastrophic damage
of the neck structures.

06:57.352 --> 06:58.778
Agreed.

06:58.845 --> 07:01.245
And this abrasion here from the wad.

07:01.476 --> 07:02.542
Yes.

07:02.659 --> 07:06.073
Now, there should be
a corresponding mark on his singlet.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.097
Alice?

07:13.812 --> 07:15.473
Well there's blood
on the victim's shoes?

07:15.531 --> 07:16.546
Yes.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.917
How is that a surprise?

07:18.018 --> 07:22.045
Well, with a single shotgun blast
to a victim facing their killer,

07:22.112 --> 07:23.606
at close range...

07:24.472 --> 07:26.819
..they'd be propelled backwards
immediately.

07:26.886 --> 07:28.206
Yes, but how did the blood

07:28.300 --> 07:30.134
drip straight down onto
the top of Daryl's boots?

07:30.191 --> 07:31.125
Exactly.

07:31.192 --> 07:32.698
It's...

07:32.765 --> 07:34.729
It's an unexpected sort of pattern.

07:34.801 --> 07:36.495
There's evidence
that these fires were started

07:36.552 --> 07:37.804
using some sort of accelerant?

07:37.893 --> 07:40.643
Well, it looks like it, if water
couldn't put the flames out.

07:40.776 --> 07:41.804
I'll go back

07:41.875 --> 07:44.531
and see if Mrs Fitzpatrick's
ready to answer some questions.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.656
Good.

07:45.714 --> 07:47.500
We find out who started
these fires on his farm,

07:47.557 --> 07:49.845
we find out
who killed Daryl Fitzpatrick.

07:57.383 --> 07:58.844
I thought that might be of interest.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.098
From archives.

08:00.165 --> 08:02.285
Kevin Fitzpatrick
went to the Melbourne Olympics?

08:02.352 --> 08:05.058
The Men's Trap
and the 300 metre rifle.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.974
Quite the coincidence, isn't it?

08:07.032 --> 08:08.180
Definitely.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.762
Edward?

08:12.852 --> 08:14.430
You and Daryl Fitzpatrick. I'm...

08:14.504 --> 08:16.168
I'm sorry,
is all I was going to say.

08:17.058 --> 08:19.032
He was a business associate, Rose.

08:21.525 --> 08:23.325
But thank you for your concern.

08:25.486 --> 08:27.125
Was there anything else?

08:27.759 --> 08:29.427
I'll go interview the neighbours,

08:29.485 --> 08:31.766
maybe try calling
the Australian Olympic Federation?

08:31.879 --> 08:33.452
Great minds.

08:44.485 --> 08:47.602
No sign of Kevin or his mum.
Right.

08:47.765 --> 08:48.961
Charlie, there's a...

08:49.071 --> 08:51.419
There's a circular shape here

08:51.586 --> 08:55.102
that obviously
must have been covered by the body.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.797
And...

08:59.664 --> 09:03.156
..there's... There's more blood here.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.891
From our killer, maybe.

09:06.203 --> 09:08.672
Perhaps Daryl caught him
with a shot.

09:10.156 --> 09:11.531
Possibly.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.031
Either way...

09:16.046 --> 09:18.031
..we need to have this tested.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.605
And when my Jack was very young,
he was convinced that it went...

09:29.921 --> 09:31.786
We'd be sitting in here
for midnight mass,

09:31.844 --> 09:34.500
and he'd be rifling through
the Bible trying to find him.

09:34.594 --> 09:36.836
Eventually he marched
straight up to Father Moreton,

09:36.894 --> 09:39.313
demanding to know,
"Where's King Barney?"

09:39.725 --> 09:41.266
Father put him straight?

09:41.324 --> 09:42.792
Oh, my word he did.

09:42.951 --> 09:45.749
He was always such a headstrong
little boy, your Jack.

09:45.911 --> 09:46.979
He still is.

09:47.241 --> 09:48.333

09:48.391 --> 09:50.247
How are the preparations
going for the wedding?

09:50.305 --> 09:53.719
She spoke to Father yesterday.
They'll be married here next year.

09:53.805 --> 09:55.164
Ohh!

09:55.299 --> 09:58.658
You know, my mother
was married here. So was I.

09:58.897 --> 10:01.133
And now so will my little girl.

10:01.431 --> 10:03.633
I think we were all married here,
weren't we?

10:04.486 --> 10:08.305
Yes. Yes we were.

10:12.366 --> 10:16.658
Doc, this is Lionel Taylor.
He owns the property next door.

10:16.774 --> 10:19.055
Ah, Dr Lucien Blake.
Good to meet you.

10:19.172 --> 10:21.095
You were here this morning,
weren't you, Mr Taylor?

10:21.152 --> 10:23.711
Yeah, I was. Came back
to check how bad the damage was.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.961
Right.
Smells like sump oil, yes?

10:27.297 --> 10:29.299
They're going to have to
rip this whole lot.

10:29.477 --> 10:32.149
Contamination's only going to get
worse once it's weathered in.

10:32.351 --> 10:35.055
Did Daryl ever have any enemies
that you know of?

10:36.933 --> 10:38.533
Daryl was a mate, but...

10:40.125 --> 10:42.836
..he had a habit
of rubbing people up the wrong way.

10:43.406 --> 10:45.485
This new paddock here
being a prime example.

10:46.024 --> 10:47.343
He bought it a few months back.

10:47.719 --> 10:49.293
Do you know who sold him the land?

10:49.383 --> 10:51.031
I should.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.211
It was me.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.219
Should have charged him more.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.750
Had a couple of offers,
after I sold it.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.805
Daryl did alright out of me.

11:02.859 --> 11:05.352
Mr Taylor. Lionel.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.344
Who made these other offers?

11:08.525 --> 11:10.086
A couple of businessmen.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.045
Perhaps I should take
a look at that for you, Angelo?

11:43.102 --> 11:44.392
Oh no, it's nothing.

11:44.450 --> 11:45.459
How did this happen?

11:45.526 --> 11:47.444
I tried to stop a stand
from falling, and...

11:47.511 --> 11:49.535
Did you recognise
the man who did it?

11:49.620 --> 11:51.914
No.
I never seen him before in my life.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.498
He just show up here,

11:53.565 --> 11:56.501
he call my wife horrible names
and then start to break things.

11:56.643 --> 11:57.710
I see.

11:57.845 --> 12:00.365

12:13.725 --> 12:15.723

where were you last night?

12:24.086 --> 12:26.246
And there's no reason
that you can think of

12:26.403 --> 12:30.364
as to why Kevin would just
show up here out of the blue?

12:32.840 --> 12:35.028
I cut it last night
at the fire.

12:35.410 --> 12:36.957
Must have opened up again.

12:37.176 --> 12:38.843
I see.

12:39.168 --> 12:41.895
When you attacked Angelo Colonna,
perhaps?

12:42.966 --> 12:46.485
- Why go after the greengrocer, Kevin?
- Why do you reckon?

12:46.552 --> 12:47.764
He did it.

12:47.831 --> 12:48.899
Because?

12:49.043 --> 12:51.153
Because he's been making
trouble for Dad for years.

12:51.356 --> 12:53.890
And when you front 'em,
all of a sudden they act all innocent,

12:53.948 --> 12:55.348
like they can't understand you.

12:56.231 --> 12:58.301
Just makes you
wanna bloody throttle 'em.

13:00.452 --> 13:02.614
Look, if this is about that shop,
I'll...

13:02.910 --> 13:05.043
That's the least of your problems,
son.

13:06.765 --> 13:08.764
Turns out you're quite a shot.

13:09.028 --> 13:10.258
Mum taught me.

13:10.465 --> 13:12.539
The Olympics, four years ago.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.309
What about Rome?

13:14.802 --> 13:16.321
Well, didn't make it, did I?

13:18.132 --> 13:19.895
What does any of this
have to do with Dad?

13:20.153 --> 13:21.551
Kevin, I need to confirm

13:21.637 --> 13:25.098
whether you or anyone else
in the family owns a shotgun.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.637
It's the country. Every farmer
worth his salt owns a shotgun.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.121
What? I already told you
it was Colonna.

13:33.262 --> 13:35.942
Angelo Colonna
doesn't have a police record.

13:36.739 --> 13:39.543
Whereas you have been pretty busy
for the past six months.

13:39.637 --> 13:43.301
Multiple offences,
most recently this.

13:44.046 --> 13:47.188
Reports of a brawl on your farm,
called in by a concerned neighbour,

13:47.246 --> 13:49.067
between you and your father.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.348
What was the fight about, Kevin?

13:55.316 --> 13:57.075
None of your business.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.485
That cut on his leg

14:01.543 --> 14:04.700
could explain the second patch
of blood we found at the scene.

14:05.207 --> 14:06.301
Yes.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.219
I've sent that sample to Alice,

14:08.286 --> 14:09.954
to separate the blood
from the soil.

14:10.012 --> 14:12.950
We'll check Kevin's medical records.
See if we get a match.

14:13.215 --> 14:14.637
Right, there's your warrant.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.040
Head back to Fitzpatrick's farm.

14:16.098 --> 14:18.825
Need you to search inside,
top and bottom. Find me a shotgun.

14:18.905 --> 14:21.243
- Take Ned with you.
- Oh, we can't, boss.

14:21.301 --> 14:23.979
He's in West Wendouree somewhere
reports of a lost dog.

14:24.046 --> 14:26.885
Right, just you then, and call it in
on the radio if you need any help.

14:26.952 --> 14:28.301
Righto.

14:28.996 --> 14:32.819
Bill's still in Melbourne testifying
at the Police Corruption Inquiry.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.618
There won't be a single policeman

14:34.676 --> 14:36.676
who hasn't given evidence
by the time they're done.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.864
Well, Simmons is due in there
after Christmas.

14:38.973 --> 14:41.058
Ned? Really, why?

14:41.309 --> 14:43.571
A while back, he was seconded
to a station in Melbourne,

14:43.629 --> 14:45.496
suspected of taking money
under the table.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.668
Perfect time to be a man down,
isn't it?

14:49.686 --> 14:50.979
Quite.

14:51.046 --> 14:53.825
Ah, Matthew. Before I forget...

14:54.845 --> 14:56.739
This wad,

14:57.918 --> 14:59.551
it's quite distinctive.

14:59.808 --> 15:02.778
You want to see who might have
sold these things locally?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.878
Go on then.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.920
Just a second!

15:58.296 --> 15:59.656
Mr Baker.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.619
I thought...

16:01.936 --> 16:04.570
I didn't know you actually
worked here in the store.

16:06.183 --> 16:07.711
I... I don't.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.349
I'm closing down.

16:10.459 --> 16:11.734
Right.

16:11.886 --> 16:15.851
Well, I was wondering
if someone might help me identify

16:16.330 --> 16:19.249
what kind of shotgun shell
this comes from,

16:19.440 --> 16:22.757
and if in fact
you sell this particular brand.

16:22.976 --> 16:24.390
No.

16:25.254 --> 16:27.031
No to which part, exactly?

16:27.191 --> 16:28.378
No to the part

16:28.445 --> 16:31.593
where you bring evidence from
a murder investigation into my store

16:31.703 --> 16:33.129
and expect me to help you.

16:33.187 --> 16:35.444
I never said
this was from a murder investigation.

16:35.511 --> 16:37.359
You're the Police Surgeon.

16:38.886 --> 16:41.875
The paper said a farmer
was shot to death last night.

16:44.298 --> 16:47.773
I'm assuming that's from the shell
that killed Daryl Fitzpatrick.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.304
Did you know him?

16:50.664 --> 16:51.997
No.

16:52.406 --> 16:54.366
You're quite sure about that?

16:56.005 --> 16:59.019
If you have any more
questions for me, Dr Blake,

16:59.296 --> 17:02.851
I suggest you go and find a police
officer and bring him back here.

17:03.140 --> 17:07.164
Until then, get out of my store.

17:22.246 --> 17:24.414
Mrs Fitzpatrick,
this might be easier

17:24.476 --> 17:26.258
if you wait outside for a while.

17:26.414 --> 17:29.204
Easier still if you tell me
what it is you're looking for.

17:29.271 --> 17:32.921
Your husband appears to have been
killed with a shotgun.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.078
And you think the gun might be here?

17:36.609 --> 17:38.992
You do own a shotgun, don't you?

17:41.005 --> 17:42.366
Fine.

18:06.539 --> 18:08.351
Here. Anything else?

18:10.621 --> 18:13.780
I'll, um... I'll still need
to complete my search.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.299
Fine.

18:15.906 --> 18:17.366
Excuse me.

18:27.343 --> 18:30.328
Yes, I do know
Kevin Fitzpatrick.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.078
The boy was going to be
a dual Olympian.

18:33.147 --> 18:35.968
And I'm guessing that drew
the attention of Tyneman Sports.

18:36.054 --> 18:38.453
For God's sake!
Patrick, please, I need to know.

18:38.591 --> 18:41.781
Did the Fitzpatricks approach
you about sponsoring Kevin for Rome?

18:41.889 --> 18:43.373
It's ever so important.

18:43.492 --> 18:48.265
Point of fact, they didn't
approach me. I approached him.

18:48.491 --> 18:49.619
Young Kevin.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.333
And?

18:51.487 --> 18:53.609
And he refused.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.070
Said he wouldn't go,
even if he had the money himself.

19:01.713 --> 19:03.672
What was Bill Hobart's evidence?

19:05.249 --> 19:07.449
Is there anything else
I should know about?

19:10.415 --> 19:11.984
Lucien Blake?

19:13.100 --> 19:14.579
Are you sure?

19:15.476 --> 19:17.304
Can you double-check that for me?

19:17.687 --> 19:19.625
I'm going to have to call you back.

19:20.086 --> 19:21.742
The Police Corruption Inquiry.

19:21.804 --> 19:23.521
They're calling up officers
from Ballarat now.

19:23.578 --> 19:25.812
Nothing much
from today's testimony.

19:25.961 --> 19:28.601
Stay on it. What else?

19:29.435 --> 19:33.390
Still waiting on an official
statement on the Fitzpatrick murder.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.461
Well, it can wait
till the afternoon edition tomorrow.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.765
Rose, I was thinking you
might like to have dinner tonight.

19:43.925 --> 19:47.312
Edward, um, thank you.

19:47.984 --> 19:50.125
I have plans to meet someone.

19:50.414 --> 19:52.617
It's been arranged for ages,
actually.

19:53.543 --> 19:54.867
Oh.

19:56.046 --> 19:59.406
- Who, if you don't mind me asking?
- Charlie Davis.

20:01.005 --> 20:02.281
I see.

20:06.286 --> 20:09.703
So, just bad timing, then.

20:13.341 --> 20:14.656
Fair enough.

20:15.062 --> 20:16.410
Really?

20:16.660 --> 20:18.046
Of course.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.023
You have a good night, Rose.

20:21.296 --> 20:24.523
I will. You too.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.019
- Sump oil?
- Yes.

20:37.086 --> 20:40.171
That's the accelerant
our arsonist used. Thank you.

20:40.265 --> 20:43.098
- Well, it's hardly the best choice.
- Mmm, good point.

20:43.156 --> 20:45.944
If it was me, I'd use something
much more flammable.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.265
Uh, you've missed a spot.
Hmm?

20:48.406 --> 20:49.975
Uh, thank you, Matthew.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.718
I mean, I'd only use sump oil
if I wanted to, I don't know,

20:52.836 --> 20:54.584
spoil the land, or...

20:54.886 --> 20:57.222
Well, the neighbour in fact said

20:57.280 --> 20:59.968
the... Fitzpatricks
would have to strip the topsoil

21:00.030 --> 21:01.281
to get rid of the contamination.

21:01.338 --> 21:03.510
Hmm. That'd be Lionel Taylor.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.457
Yes. You know him?

21:05.535 --> 21:07.124
Yes, he was a friend
of Christopher's.

21:07.191 --> 21:09.175
He moved here
fresh out of university.

21:09.363 --> 21:11.293
Christopher taught him
all about farming.

21:11.363 --> 21:13.041
He was a very fast learner.

21:13.143 --> 21:16.300
- Now, do you mind, Lucien?
- Uh!

21:16.465 --> 21:18.543
Ah, yes, of course.
Isn't she lovely?

21:18.675 --> 21:20.644
No-one really spoke to him
when he first moved in.

21:20.711 --> 21:21.979
Because?

21:22.046 --> 21:24.524
Oh, I think they thought
he was city trying to be country.

21:24.591 --> 21:26.058
Ah, that old chestnut.

21:26.246 --> 21:27.719
His wife was a bit of a cold fish

21:27.777 --> 21:29.213
but I always really liked Lionel.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.425
He was such a hard worker
and very intelligent.

21:31.483 --> 21:34.105
In fact, I think he was probably
the smartest man I'd ever met.

21:34.277 --> 21:35.660
Is that so?

21:35.886 --> 21:37.722
Well, up until that point,
anyway.

21:38.805 --> 21:40.668
Dinner's almost ready.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.535
Smartest man she'd ever met, hey?

21:43.668 --> 21:46.949
And I'd thank you, Matthew,
not to encourage him quite so much.

21:47.691 --> 21:49.527
Ready? Matthew?

21:51.064 --> 21:54.738
Ah... lovely.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.370
I don't understand.
How did you hear about it?

22:01.512 --> 22:04.464
From a contact that I have
in the Melbourne court system.

22:04.682 --> 22:05.902
And he said...

22:05.960 --> 22:08.003
..that a divorce hearing
for Lucien Radcliffe Blake

22:08.071 --> 22:09.698
was scheduled for a month's time,

22:09.765 --> 22:11.927
on the grounds of drunkenness
and cruelty.

22:13.661 --> 22:15.731
Does anyone else know about this?

22:17.215 --> 22:19.497
I wanted to make sure
that you both knew.

22:20.301 --> 22:23.372
Well, I'll be talking to Lucien
just as soon as he gets home.

22:23.805 --> 22:25.458
Thank you, Rose.

22:26.004 --> 22:29.044
Why wouldn't she just
tell me their shotgun was broken?

22:29.934 --> 22:32.035
That's what
we're here to find out.

22:32.192 --> 22:34.911
She's not going to be happy,
with Kevin still in the lockup.

22:35.686 --> 22:36.819
At this point, Charlie,

22:36.886 --> 22:39.331
I think we'll get more from the
mother than we will from the son...

22:39.388 --> 22:42.098
Oh, bloody...!

22:42.165 --> 22:45.194
I told you lot,
you can all go to hell!

22:45.353 --> 22:47.979
I'm not scared of you!

22:48.125 --> 22:51.285
Mrs Fitzpatrick! This is the police!

22:51.430 --> 22:53.082
Get off my land!

22:54.325 --> 22:55.539
Eileen, it's Dr Blake.

22:55.606 --> 22:57.564
I'm here with Senior Sergeant Davis!

22:57.632 --> 23:00.890
Put the rifle down
and come out, please.

23:01.966 --> 23:04.230
You here to lock me up too,
are you?

23:04.288 --> 23:05.827
No, not at all,
Eileen.

23:05.961 --> 23:07.468
We just...

23:07.679 --> 23:09.379
We just want to talk with you,
that's all.

23:09.437 --> 23:11.647
- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- That's right.

23:13.486 --> 23:15.246
You better come in then.

23:17.046 --> 23:18.686
Bloody hell.

23:22.952 --> 23:24.512
Thank you.

23:26.141 --> 23:29.194
For heaven's sake, Eileen,
who did you think we were?

23:29.515 --> 23:30.905
Edward Tyneman.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.539
He was here last night.

23:32.710 --> 23:35.710
He ripped up the contract
that he and Daryl signed.

23:35.912 --> 23:38.952
Had a new one,
offering much less.

23:39.390 --> 23:40.780
Of course he did.

23:40.966 --> 23:42.578
And when I didn't sign it,

23:42.749 --> 23:46.038
he said he was going to send someone
back to renegotiate the terms.

23:46.116 --> 23:47.413
You should have reported him.

23:47.546 --> 23:50.655
While you're holding Kevin
in lockup for no reason?

23:53.772 --> 23:56.965
Mrs Fitzpatrick, I need to do
one last search of the property.

23:57.032 --> 23:58.886
If you'll excuse me.

24:01.772 --> 24:04.390
Eileen, from everything I've heard,

24:04.966 --> 24:10.405
Kevin was never in any sort of trouble,
until about six months ago.

24:11.038 --> 24:14.560
Doctor, if there's nothing else...

24:19.005 --> 24:21.444
No!
Let me! It's alright, it's alright.

24:21.518 --> 24:22.932
I was just...

24:27.814 --> 24:29.214
Eileen.

24:32.005 --> 24:33.525
Goodbye, Doctor.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.372
Woof!

24:56.977 --> 24:58.377
What on earth were you thinking?

24:58.466 --> 25:00.810
This is a police station,
not a pet shop.

25:00.924 --> 25:04.760
I'm sorry, boss. He's lame.
Both the vets are away.

25:04.818 --> 25:09.004
There's been a suspected outbreak
of foot and mouth in Chiltern.

25:09.427 --> 25:11.467
You were saying we're short-staffed.

25:11.681 --> 25:13.295
Oh, very funny.

25:13.592 --> 25:14.844
I left Charlie at the farm.

25:14.911 --> 25:16.258
- Cuppa?
- Mmm.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.014
Yes, he's called for a divvy van
to go and pick him up.

25:19.130 --> 25:20.327
What's that?

25:20.385 --> 25:23.100
Oh, Eileen's medical records
from the hospital.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.248
A series
of unexplained injuries

25:25.319 --> 25:26.524
over the last 20 years.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.131
And in fact only recently,

25:28.303 --> 25:31.108
she was admitted
with badly bruised kidneys.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.006
So, her husband was abusing her.

25:34.306 --> 25:35.966
I'd say so.

25:36.288 --> 25:38.123
Well, it speaks to motive.

25:38.581 --> 25:41.468
Kevin did say that she was the one
who taught him how to shoot.

25:43.303 --> 25:44.458
Yes.

25:44.525 --> 25:47.936
Speaking of shooting, Matthew,
your cane, would you mind if I, um...

25:48.638 --> 25:49.867
Thank you.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.678
Now, according to these,

25:52.092 --> 25:56.053
she suffered severe damage
to her rotator cuff four years ago.

25:56.156 --> 25:59.827
Now, she could barely aim a rifle
at us today.

25:59.913 --> 26:01.486
She did what?!

26:04.486 --> 26:06.470
Anyhow, my point is this.

26:06.696 --> 26:10.032
If she couldn't even lift a rifle
to her shoulder,

26:10.157 --> 26:14.040
how on earth would she have handled
the kick from a shotgun?

26:14.243 --> 26:16.392
Well, maybe from that range
it was shoot from the hip

26:16.454 --> 26:17.720
and hope for the best.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.098
Well...

26:19.337 --> 26:22.525
Boss. Doc. I've got something
I think you should see.

26:22.864 --> 26:24.676
I found it in the long grass,

26:24.845 --> 26:28.206
in a gully between Daryl
and Lionel's properties.

26:28.606 --> 26:30.081
Sump oil.

26:30.925 --> 26:33.004
And then there's this.

26:33.237 --> 26:34.578
Ahh.

26:35.082 --> 26:36.362
Ooh!

26:37.137 --> 26:38.350
Dried blood.

26:38.511 --> 26:39.778
And these holes,

26:39.845 --> 26:42.219
I'm thinking
pellets from a shotgun shell.

26:42.323 --> 26:45.167
So Daryl wasn't shot standing up.
He was leaning against this.

26:45.253 --> 26:46.316
Yeah.

26:46.501 --> 26:48.589
I'm going to interview
Lionel Taylor.

26:49.712 --> 26:51.925
Oh well, take him with you,
would you?

26:52.348 --> 26:54.151
Simmons, I mean, not the dog.

26:55.845 --> 26:57.891
We're still waiting on bloods
from Dr Harvey, aren't we?

26:57.948 --> 26:59.558
Any chance we could
speed things up?

26:59.823 --> 27:02.050
Yes, yes. I'll see what I can do.

27:07.604 --> 27:09.644
What exactly
are you suggesting, Sergeant?

27:09.816 --> 27:12.858
I'm just saying that the barrel
looks like it contains sump oil.

27:12.925 --> 27:15.581
It was found on your fence line
and it was stained with blood.

27:15.777 --> 27:19.461
So, in your mind,
the only possible explanation

27:19.519 --> 27:22.519
is that I set the fires
and I killed Daryl.

27:23.205 --> 27:24.764
Should I just confess now, then?

27:24.831 --> 27:27.045
Well you could.
It'd save us a lot of time.

27:27.206 --> 27:28.644
Oh, the barrel's not mine.

27:28.793 --> 27:30.394
And I don't even own a shotgun.

27:31.369 --> 27:34.003
If you want to search the farm,
you're absolutely welcome to.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.386
- Everything alright, Lionel?
- It's fine, Kev.

27:36.534 --> 27:38.355
I'll be back in an hour, two tops.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.925
- Shall we?
- Please.

27:43.565 --> 27:47.261
SPEAKS  ITALIAN

27:58.303 --> 27:59.644
Doctor.

27:59.702 --> 28:02.115
- Oh, Angelo. Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

28:02.186 --> 28:03.905
I trust I'm not
interrupting anything.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.333
No no no, I was just tasting
the latest batch of my wine.

28:07.391 --> 28:09.941
Ahhh!
Would you like to help?

28:13.117 --> 28:14.784
It'd be rude not to, eh?

28:15.686 --> 28:16.924
- Bene.
- Prego.

28:16.991 --> 28:18.097
Grazie.

28:22.525 --> 28:23.539
Supremo!

28:23.606 --> 28:26.550
Angelo, where did you...
where did you learn to make wine?

28:26.657 --> 28:28.198
Ah, the family business.

28:28.527 --> 28:30.258
Papa and Nonno. You know.

28:30.487 --> 28:33.031
Yes, family business.
I know a thing or two about it.

28:33.089 --> 28:35.417
My father, Thomas,
was a doctor too.

28:35.495 --> 28:38.179
- Ah, here in Ballarat?
- Si.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.292
My wife, she like Dr Spencer.

28:41.855 --> 28:44.691
Yes, Spencer.
He's a good doctor.

28:44.761 --> 28:48.362
He's a sleepy old man,
with little eyes, like a mole.

28:50.386 --> 28:52.979
But she used to him now.
Tradition.

28:53.046 --> 28:56.784
These things are very important,
to her at least. Capische?

28:56.964 --> 28:58.652
Yes. Yes, I understand.

28:58.854 --> 29:02.226
You know,
I have some homemade grappa as well,

29:02.325 --> 29:03.909
if you'd like to taste some.

29:04.222 --> 29:05.769
Grappa, you say?

29:07.234 --> 29:09.261
- Alright.
- Bravo.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.885
This one here, it gonna put
Italian hairs on your chest.

29:31.995 --> 29:33.141
Here's hoping.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.784
- Salute.
- Salute.

29:39.106 --> 29:40.159
Mmm!

29:40.386 --> 29:42.258
- Is good, huh?
- Yes.

29:42.378 --> 29:44.862
This is why
I tried to buy the land from Daryl,

29:44.987 --> 29:47.291
to make my own wine,
like home in Italy.

29:47.348 --> 29:48.352
Eh?

29:48.439 --> 29:51.324
When I find my land,
you be my best customer.

29:51.391 --> 29:52.806
Guaranteed.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.783
Angelo, the night Daryl died,

29:58.359 --> 30:01.957
you said you were nowhere near
the fires on his property.

30:02.088 --> 30:04.553
Si. I already told the police this.

30:04.611 --> 30:06.463
Yes, yes.

30:07.086 --> 30:11.978
I notice your fences,
garden stakes...

30:12.551 --> 30:15.814
..all coated with sump oil.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.588
Protect them from termites
and the like.

30:19.431 --> 30:20.806
Thing is,

30:21.145 --> 30:25.359
someone set that fire
using sump oil,

30:25.606 --> 30:29.166
and the police have found a barrel
you know, a drum,

30:29.289 --> 30:31.494
with traces of sump oil in it,

30:31.983 --> 30:38.072
the same kind you use to display
your stock at the fruit shop.

30:41.725 --> 30:45.805
SPEAKS ITALIAN

30:48.966 --> 30:50.405
You know what this means?

30:50.463 --> 30:51.571
Ah...

30:51.697 --> 30:55.145
You cannot hide the truth
from a priest, doctor...

30:55.203 --> 30:56.457
- or lawyer.
- Or lawyer.

30:58.886 --> 31:00.400
He said he'd sell.

31:00.966 --> 31:04.166
He took our deposit
and then he sell to somebody else

31:04.228 --> 31:05.830
and he keep our money,

31:05.963 --> 31:08.048
even after
we got the lawyer onto him.

31:08.673 --> 31:11.486
Si.
Yes, I burn his land with the oil.

31:12.725 --> 31:15.645
I drove away, the barrel
fell off the back of the truck.

31:16.805 --> 31:18.598
But I never hurt Daryl.

31:18.765 --> 31:20.426
Even after he shot at you?

31:20.520 --> 31:21.819
No.

31:22.659 --> 31:24.898
Daryl was a bastard.

31:25.574 --> 31:28.032
He hit his wife,
he cheat his workers, he lied to me,

31:28.090 --> 31:30.652
he lied to my business partner,
he lied to everyone.

31:31.753 --> 31:33.591
He deserve everything he got,
Doctor.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.226
Hang on a moment, Angelo.

31:37.192 --> 31:39.027
You have a business partner?

31:39.402 --> 31:40.619
Si.

31:40.895 --> 31:42.165
Who?

31:50.931 --> 31:54.051
Ohh! My apologies, Miss.

31:59.015 --> 32:02.148
G'day.
Look at you.

32:02.286 --> 32:06.885
Well, you'll be happy to know
I've discovered who set those fires.

32:07.066 --> 32:09.138
Yes, I have.

32:09.285 --> 32:11.426
- Have you just?
- Yes.

32:11.765 --> 32:15.129
Angelo Colonna. He's our man.

32:17.731 --> 32:19.082
Everything alright?

32:20.873 --> 32:23.738
You haven't seen this afternoon's
edition, I'm guessing?

32:27.386 --> 32:30.073
Commissioner's office
hasn't called yet, but they will.

32:33.645 --> 32:35.246
How dare he.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.738
Edward bloody Tyneman again.

32:38.805 --> 32:40.840
He had no right to print this,
Matthew. No right!

32:40.910 --> 32:43.355
- Just... just calm down.
- I am calm!

32:45.325 --> 32:46.973
You're drunk now, aren't you?

32:48.205 --> 32:49.578
Oh, for God's sake, Lucien,

32:49.645 --> 32:51.095
do you have any idea
how badly this reflects

32:51.152 --> 32:54.043
not just on me but
every other officer in this station?

32:54.805 --> 32:56.941
I've had a few drinks.
What of it?

32:57.230 --> 32:59.610
I'm the one who found out
Angelo set those fires.

32:59.668 --> 33:02.095
I'm trying to work out a way
of containing the damage from this.

33:02.152 --> 33:04.488
- And Norman Baker...
- Go home, Blake!

33:04.668 --> 33:06.685
That Baker was his business partner
all along!

33:06.752 --> 33:07.966
That's enough!

33:13.565 --> 33:15.688
I accomplish more drunk

33:16.286 --> 33:20.079
than you and your entire
bloody department do sober!

33:20.542 --> 33:22.222
Get out of my station.

33:22.421 --> 33:23.914
Go and sober up!

33:24.923 --> 33:26.366
Go on!

33:36.509 --> 33:40.339
Why would you do this? It isn't even
news. It's trashy gossip at best.

33:40.406 --> 33:44.290
- Maybe, but it'll sell papers.
- With my name attached to the story.

33:44.868 --> 33:46.759
That'll be all, Miss Anderson.

33:47.686 --> 33:49.790
You gave me this by-line
out of spite

33:49.848 --> 33:51.587
because I chose Charlie over you.

33:52.296 --> 33:56.188
You let your feelings get in the way
of a job that I pay you to do.

33:56.612 --> 33:57.790
Again.

33:58.141 --> 33:59.978
You know,
I thought you were ready.

34:00.404 --> 34:01.591
My mistake.

34:01.751 --> 34:05.458
It's one I don't intend on making
again. Goodbye, Miss Anderson.

34:05.609 --> 34:07.009
You can't fire me for that!

34:07.149 --> 34:08.969
That's funny, I thought I just did.

34:10.641 --> 34:12.882
Ah, Doctor. Listen,
if you're here...

34:16.085 --> 34:17.893
That was your last warning.

34:18.991 --> 34:20.483
You have no idea...

34:20.645 --> 34:23.179
You ever print
another word about my family,

34:23.426 --> 34:26.018
I will come back here
and finish what I started.

34:26.179 --> 34:27.594
Do you understand me?

34:29.576 --> 34:30.896
Lucien.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.184
Jean? Oh thank God, Jean.

34:42.686 --> 34:44.293
Rose, why would you?

34:44.440 --> 34:45.668
Jean, you don't understand. I...

34:45.726 --> 34:47.504
No, I thought we were friends.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.023
You should know, Mr Baker,

34:52.081 --> 34:54.980
we're currently holding
Angelo Colonna in the cells.

34:57.246 --> 34:58.480
And?

34:58.870 --> 35:02.160
And we'll be speaking with him
once we've finished with you.

35:03.582 --> 35:06.498
What's your relationship
with Mr Colonna?

35:06.762 --> 35:08.613
He's a business partner.

35:09.715 --> 35:10.971
That's it.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.621
You were working together to buy
that farm from Daryl Fitzpatrick.

35:15.254 --> 35:16.547
Angelo and I

35:16.605 --> 35:19.988
paid Daryl a down payment
on that land a while back, yes.

35:20.129 --> 35:24.339
But he didn't end up selling to you,
and he didn't return your money.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.652
No, we hadn't got our money back.

35:27.827 --> 35:30.965
Did you know
of Angelo's plans to set the fire?

35:31.574 --> 35:33.168
Of course not.

35:33.504 --> 35:38.129
Besides, you know
what these New Australians are like.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.365
So why did you partner up with one?

35:41.605 --> 35:43.644
Angelo knows wine.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.059
I know business.

35:48.269 --> 35:51.049
We checked with these solicitors,
Mr Baker.

35:51.208 --> 35:54.366
They've confirmed
they sent the letter on your behalf

35:54.424 --> 35:56.877
to Daryl Fitzpatrick,
threatening legal action.

35:57.026 --> 35:58.166
Yes.

35:58.283 --> 36:00.791
And then a week before
Daryl was killed,

36:01.246 --> 36:04.143
well you suddenly told them
to cease proceedings.

36:05.729 --> 36:07.046
I assume at some stage

36:07.104 --> 36:10.046
you're going to get round
to asking me a question, yes?

36:11.401 --> 36:12.830
Alright.

36:13.725 --> 36:14.659
Where were you

36:14.726 --> 36:17.604
on the night that Daryl Fitzpatrick
was murdered, Mr Baker?

36:31.205 --> 36:35.510
Blake, we missed you at
the police station this afternoon.

36:35.711 --> 36:37.019
I'm sure you did.

36:37.182 --> 36:39.104
Shall we just get to the point?

36:39.338 --> 36:40.420
Please.

36:40.533 --> 36:44.198
I think you put Angelo Colonna
up to setting those fires.

36:45.606 --> 36:47.464
I understand he confessed.

36:48.966 --> 36:51.886
Doesn't mean
you weren't there that night, too.

36:52.284 --> 36:55.073
You lied about not knowing
the victim. You had motive.

36:55.358 --> 36:57.916
We still don't have a murder weapon
and you own a gun shop.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.979
I think you timed all of this

37:00.073 --> 37:03.362
to coincide with closing up
and leaving town.

37:05.603 --> 37:07.706
The police have searched my store.

37:08.925 --> 37:10.581
And they've questioned me.

37:10.805 --> 37:13.456
So I'll tell you
exactly what I told them.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.171
I was in a room
at O'Connell's Boarding House

37:16.229 --> 37:17.839
the night before last.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.862
They've checked my alibi.

37:22.445 --> 37:24.204
You really expect me to believe

37:24.271 --> 37:27.050
you're here
just to collect some stock?

37:27.335 --> 37:29.476
Now what about
your deposit on that farm?

37:29.534 --> 37:30.906
Why would you stop pursuing it...

37:30.964 --> 37:33.323
Because
it doesn't matter anymore.

37:35.495 --> 37:37.901
I'm going to pay my final respects
to my daughter,

37:38.018 --> 37:39.706
and then I'm leaving.

37:39.966 --> 37:43.706
Norman, your daughter Jessie died
over 10 years ago.

37:43.813 --> 37:46.050
- I remember you telling me yourself.
- Not Jessie.

37:46.941 --> 37:48.417
Not Jessie.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.284
Anna.

37:50.925 --> 37:53.315
The one you helped
to put into prison.

37:54.296 --> 37:56.409
She took her own life.

37:57.563 --> 37:59.163
No.

38:02.282 --> 38:04.096
I had no idea.

38:05.596 --> 38:07.458
Were you drunk then too?

38:08.042 --> 38:10.026
The day that you had her arrested?

38:14.541 --> 38:15.878
No.

38:17.165 --> 38:18.405
I was doing my job, Norman.

38:18.472 --> 38:21.210
I am... I am so sorry.

38:22.163 --> 38:23.788
Now you're sorry!

38:26.125 --> 38:30.531
But in the moment,
it's not about justice for you, is it?

38:31.133 --> 38:33.796
It's all about you being right.

38:35.773 --> 38:38.046
Jessie was eight years old
when she died.

38:38.695 --> 38:41.255
That was the worst thing that had
ever happened to me in my life.

38:41.340 --> 38:42.976
But she went quickly.

38:46.017 --> 38:47.497
My Anna...

38:49.606 --> 38:52.296
..I watched her
gradually lose herself

38:52.494 --> 38:54.774
in that place that you put her.

38:56.492 --> 39:01.530
I watched my daughter die by inches,
Doctor.

39:02.793 --> 39:04.617
So you tell me.

39:06.165 --> 39:07.593
Is it worth it?

39:08.100 --> 39:09.271
Is it?

39:09.487 --> 39:12.132
Always being right?

39:16.234 --> 39:19.226
And no, I don't care
about the deposit on the farm.

39:19.952 --> 39:21.562
I'm going to...

39:22.172 --> 39:24.107
I'm gonna load up my truck

39:24.321 --> 39:26.085
and then I'm gonna head off

39:26.445 --> 39:30.031
and with any luck I'll never see you
or this town ever again.

39:32.486 --> 39:34.325
You know the way out.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.671
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.734
What is it
that you wanted to confess?

39:54.353 --> 39:55.796
I don't know.

39:58.445 --> 39:59.644
It's not really a confession.

39:59.711 --> 40:01.617
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

40:03.828 --> 40:07.132
I don't want to lie to myself.

40:08.612 --> 40:10.085
Or to God.

40:12.781 --> 40:18.398
But how is it that the church sees
me and Lucien marrying as a sin?

40:20.117 --> 40:25.663
How is that fair,
and right, in the eyes of God?

40:26.342 --> 40:28.390
But you're not married.

40:28.984 --> 40:30.821
Are you? Not yet.

40:31.772 --> 40:35.890
And nothing has been done
that can't be undone, has it?

40:37.647 --> 40:38.890
No.

40:40.565 --> 40:46.859
Jean, it's alright. Whatever
you're thinking, God will understand.

40:58.913 --> 41:00.394
You know?

41:01.429 --> 41:04.023
I think everyone in town
knows by now.

41:05.546 --> 41:08.496
Lucien, I thought we agreed to wait
until Mei Lin responded.

41:08.554 --> 41:09.938
We did. We did.

41:10.005 --> 41:11.828
Then why did you ignore me?

41:12.843 --> 41:15.562
Because you know best and I'm still
just the housekeeper, is that it?

41:15.619 --> 41:16.835
No.

41:17.319 --> 41:18.468
No, of course not.

41:18.526 --> 41:20.562
Lucien,
you don't need to protect me.

41:21.001 --> 41:23.312
I have managed perfectly well
on my own

41:23.429 --> 41:25.320
for a long time
before you came along.

41:26.476 --> 41:27.788
Yes, I know.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.486
Jean, please forgive me. I...

41:35.525 --> 41:37.343
I am so sorry.

41:38.611 --> 41:40.413
I've been a bloody fool.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.313
And I understand, given everything
I've put you through,

41:46.371 --> 41:48.054
if you've changed your mind.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.761
About us. About...

41:52.340 --> 41:54.100
..about everything.

42:04.837 --> 42:06.238
Goodnight.

42:30.445 --> 42:33.605
Of course, Mrs Dunn, I'll let him know.
Thank you for calling.

42:33.663 --> 42:35.237
Goodbye.

42:39.527 --> 42:41.580
Everything alright with Mrs Dunn?

42:41.694 --> 42:44.053
That's our fourth cancellation
for the day.

42:44.144 --> 42:47.457
Looks like you'll be free to work
all day on the Fitzpatrick case.

42:47.824 --> 42:49.371
Right.

42:49.452 --> 42:52.691
Well, this all looks lovely,
thank you, Jean.

42:53.776 --> 42:55.496
Charlie.

42:57.286 --> 43:00.020
Anything new on any of our suspects?

43:00.286 --> 43:03.085
Well, there is one thing that's been
bothering me about Lionel Taylor.

43:03.152 --> 43:04.299
What about him?

43:04.496 --> 43:05.660
Oh, there's rumours

43:05.754 --> 43:08.902
that Lionel's wife hated Eileen
with a passion.

43:09.035 --> 43:10.824
Perhaps with very good reason.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.993
Oh, sounds to me
like people making things up

43:13.051 --> 43:14.527
just to have something
to talk about.

43:14.585 --> 43:17.019
No no,
Rose visited all the neighbours.

43:17.086 --> 43:18.527
She heard the same thing.

43:18.595 --> 43:22.340
Well,
Rose is very good at her job.

43:23.298 --> 43:26.340
Jean,
Rose didn't write that article.

43:26.605 --> 43:30.090
And Edward Tyneman fired her because
she wouldn't tell him what she knew.

43:30.272 --> 43:32.035
- Is that right?
- Mmm.

43:33.259 --> 43:37.496
In that case, I owe her an apology.

43:37.996 --> 43:39.458
Well, we both do.

43:39.652 --> 43:43.277
It can wait, Doc. She'll understand.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.058
Alright, Charlie.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.723
Just getting back to Daryl, if I may.

43:50.161 --> 43:52.723
We know that
before he sold his farm,

43:52.910 --> 43:55.458
he acquired that one paddock
from Lionel.

43:55.516 --> 43:58.574
Yeah, which he got from his mate
for well under market value.

43:58.632 --> 43:59.859
Yes.

44:00.205 --> 44:01.480
Think about this.

44:02.216 --> 44:07.262
He loses his most valuable
piece of land for next to nothing.

44:07.394 --> 44:10.183
Yeah,
it'd be a pretty strong motive.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.829
The Lionel I knew was never
particularly money hungry.

44:13.910 --> 44:17.564
No, just extraordinarily intelligent,
if memory serves.

44:19.621 --> 44:22.558
He and Jean were friends,
apparently.

44:22.715 --> 44:23.949
A long time ago.

44:24.074 --> 44:25.152
Really?

44:25.215 --> 44:27.348
He was friends with my late husband.

44:27.606 --> 44:30.058
He's trying to make it sound
salacious on purpose.

44:30.887 --> 44:32.445
No I...

44:47.969 --> 44:51.342
You think that Kevin
is Lionel's son, based on what?

44:51.440 --> 44:54.375
Based on Darwin, mostly.
The man, not the place.

44:54.468 --> 44:59.378
He theorised that certain
facial expressions are innate

44:59.445 --> 45:00.742
and not learned.

45:00.886 --> 45:03.273
Mr Darwin
have any theories on drinking?

45:06.500 --> 45:08.710
With Kevin and Lionel,

45:09.647 --> 45:13.246
this particular thing
they both do facially

45:13.304 --> 45:16.609
when they're...
when they're angry or stressed.

45:17.531 --> 45:21.093
They sort of bite down
on their bottom lip.

45:21.824 --> 45:23.517
And you actually agree with this?

45:23.575 --> 45:24.852
It ties in
to what the neighbours said

45:24.909 --> 45:27.989
about the tension between Eileen
and Lionel's deceased wife.

45:28.388 --> 45:31.844
What if Lionel and Eileen
were madly in love all this time?

45:32.075 --> 45:35.349
And really,
Daryl was the only obstacle

45:35.466 --> 45:37.524
preventing them
from being together.

45:38.028 --> 45:40.489
We've been married
for nearly 30 years.

45:40.686 --> 45:41.995
Do you think I was just out there,

45:42.052 --> 45:43.885
throwing myself at other men
all that time?

45:43.952 --> 45:45.046
No.

45:46.208 --> 45:47.802
I think
you were in a loveless marriage

45:47.860 --> 45:51.138
with someone who had no qualms
about using his firsts on you.

45:52.725 --> 45:54.653
I'd had my suspicions...

45:54.887 --> 45:56.505
..about what Daryl was doing.

45:57.099 --> 45:59.536
You had your suspicions?
And when was that?

45:59.641 --> 46:02.227
When he broke her wrist?
Her nose?

46:02.325 --> 46:05.299
When he irreparably damaged
her shoulder perhaps...

46:05.366 --> 46:06.966
It wasn't my place to step in.

46:07.552 --> 46:09.184
No, I suppose not.

46:09.645 --> 46:12.619
Because you'd already intervened

46:12.958 --> 46:15.341
in the Fitzpatricks' marriage,
hadn't you?

46:15.776 --> 46:19.716
Lionel was... from the city.

46:20.671 --> 46:24.481
He was gentle,
in all the ways that Daryl wasn't.

46:26.288 --> 46:28.047
Which is why
you're in love with him.

46:29.584 --> 46:31.747
That's never what it was.

46:32.273 --> 46:35.692
My wife, she loathed the country.

46:37.239 --> 46:39.239
She hated me
for making me come here.

46:41.165 --> 46:45.044
There were years there
we barely even spoke.

46:46.645 --> 46:48.165
And I was lonely.

46:50.098 --> 46:52.052
Eileen was...

46:52.684 --> 46:54.723
..smart and tough.

46:56.249 --> 46:57.889
She was so beautiful.

47:01.645 --> 47:03.169
And she chose me.

47:06.367 --> 47:08.687
We were only together once or twice,
but...

47:10.517 --> 47:12.247
It was a long time ago.

47:12.506 --> 47:14.426
And one of those times...

47:16.606 --> 47:18.805
One of those times led to Kevin.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.691
Does he know?

47:29.295 --> 47:30.825
I would never have left Daryl.

47:31.005 --> 47:34.245
He loved me,
no matter what you think.

47:34.739 --> 47:38.208
Well,
he had a funny way of showing it.

47:38.686 --> 47:40.019
Yes, we fought.

47:40.153 --> 47:44.045
And yes when the pain was bad,
I wished horrible things on him.

47:44.591 --> 47:46.653
But the good outweighed the bad,

47:46.985 --> 47:50.505
and aside from Daryl,
God and myself...

47:52.698 --> 47:56.427
..I don't see
that that's anybody else's business.

47:57.201 --> 47:58.849
Lionel...

48:00.745 --> 48:03.763
..you've never stopped loving Eileen,
have you?

48:07.015 --> 48:08.724
Doesn't matter, though, does it?

48:10.392 --> 48:11.841
It never did.

48:13.958 --> 48:17.302
I see. Alright, Alice, thank you.

48:17.744 --> 48:19.958
- And she still wouldn't leave him?
- No.

48:20.910 --> 48:23.923
Well, that second blood sample
from the murder scene,

48:23.981 --> 48:25.817
still no definitive result.

48:26.247 --> 48:27.407
Arrgh!

48:27.465 --> 48:28.831
- Matthew, are you right?
- Bloody Simmons

48:28.888 --> 48:30.028
and his bloody lame dog!

48:30.086 --> 48:31.497
I'll move it for you.

48:35.966 --> 48:37.725
Oh, hang on a moment.

48:40.684 --> 48:42.243
I don't understand it.

48:42.840 --> 48:45.856
Some of the red cells look enlarged
for some...

48:46.747 --> 48:48.755
Bless you.

48:49.926 --> 48:51.841
I've brought a visitor with me.

48:53.895 --> 48:55.098
You're right.

48:55.277 --> 48:57.252
There's definitely a slug in there.

48:57.523 --> 48:59.497
Possibly a .22.

48:59.707 --> 49:01.302
Yes.

49:01.874 --> 49:04.731
The reason you couldn't identify
that blood sample...

49:04.871 --> 49:07.481
I think it's from our furry friend
over there.

49:07.707 --> 49:09.627
So where did the slug come from?

49:12.331 --> 49:13.732
Can you repeat that?

49:17.805 --> 49:22.295
Oh, yes, just as I thought.

49:24.725 --> 49:27.209
Faint traces of oil and grease.

49:27.736 --> 49:30.415
They're not characteristic of
a shotgun pellet, I'd have thought.

49:30.505 --> 49:34.359
No.
It's from a different gun entirely.

49:38.445 --> 49:40.205
Eileen?

49:41.694 --> 49:43.272
Ah, Lionel.

49:44.432 --> 49:47.272
Look at these two.
Aren't they just wonderful?

49:47.374 --> 49:49.592
Eileen, how many dogs do you own?

49:49.772 --> 49:51.725
Three, but one's done a runner.

49:52.012 --> 49:53.053
Yes.

49:53.209 --> 49:55.639
Frightened off
the night Daryl was killed.

49:55.795 --> 49:58.182
Yes. But how do you know?

49:58.366 --> 50:01.858
You called the neighbours
from Lionel's house, didn't you?

50:02.139 --> 50:03.577
While you were on the phone,

50:03.670 --> 50:07.179
Lionel here raced out
the door on his way to the farm.

50:07.246 --> 50:10.717
You didn't make it in time
to see Angelo driving away,

50:10.850 --> 50:12.920
but you did see someone, didn't you?

50:15.607 --> 50:17.046
You saw Kevin.

50:18.845 --> 50:23.334
You saw Kevin shoot his father,

50:23.530 --> 50:27.522
or at least the man
he believed to be his father.

50:32.889 --> 50:36.553
He thought he could save you, Eileen,

50:36.741 --> 50:40.428
from the anger, from the abuse.

50:40.631 --> 50:42.358
And he shot Daryl.

50:43.686 --> 50:45.405
With this.

50:46.459 --> 50:48.245
The slug went through Daryl's neck

50:48.405 --> 50:51.525
and believe it or not,
hit your poor dog.

50:52.449 --> 50:56.506
You said Daryl was
killed by a shotgun. Not a rifle.

50:57.808 --> 50:59.795
A shotgun, yes.

51:00.614 --> 51:02.514
Lionel's shotgun.

51:04.999 --> 51:08.514
You found Daryl already dying.

51:08.952 --> 51:13.999
You knew
your son would go to prison.

51:15.737 --> 51:18.695
So you propped Daryl up
against the drum

51:18.816 --> 51:22.403
and you disguised
the wound to his neck

51:22.565 --> 51:25.046
in the most brutal way possible.

51:40.761 --> 51:42.160
Kevin didn't do anything.

51:42.581 --> 51:46.636
It was me. I did it.

51:49.086 --> 51:50.534
Lionel Taylor,

51:52.031 --> 51:54.862
I'm arresting you for the murder
of Daryl Fitzpatrick.

51:56.325 --> 51:58.050
Anything you say...

52:10.442 --> 52:14.979
When did you know, Kevin,
that you hadn't killed him?

52:17.034 --> 52:18.620
When I saw him.

52:18.902 --> 52:21.604
I knew straightaway
that wasn't a wound from the .22.

52:25.924 --> 52:27.768
She was never going to leave him.

52:30.289 --> 52:31.917
No matter what he did.

52:36.488 --> 52:38.378
Can I ask a favour, Doc?

52:38.837 --> 52:40.050
Yes.

52:41.592 --> 52:43.729
Will you check on her,
every once in a while?

52:43.800 --> 52:45.487
Make sure she's alright?

52:49.390 --> 52:51.081
Of course I will.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.019
I wish we'd just let it all burn.

53:06.246 --> 53:08.229
You know you don't have to knock.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.079
You worked it out.

53:11.615 --> 53:16.183
Yes, thanks to Constable Ned Simmons
and his stray dog.

53:18.073 --> 53:20.479
This arrived today, from Mei Lin.

53:23.437 --> 53:24.756
Agreeing to do whatever it takes

53:24.831 --> 53:27.659
to ensure that the divorce process
is as private

53:27.722 --> 53:29.839
and as discreet as possible.

53:32.645 --> 53:34.940
I should have listened to you,
of course.

53:37.030 --> 53:39.550
- It shouldn't have to be like this.
- But it is.

53:40.627 --> 53:41.815
And I'm not sure

53:41.886 --> 53:45.003
there was ever going to be
any easy options for us, Lucien.

53:47.886 --> 53:49.300
No.

53:54.482 --> 53:56.714
I love you,
you know that, don't you?

54:00.052 --> 54:01.519
Yes, I do.

54:34.647 --> 54:37.022
Your drink, Chief Superintendent.

54:38.991 --> 54:41.202
It's just Mr Munro now, Cec.

54:41.641 --> 54:44.358
Are you here for business,
or pleasure, sir?

54:47.148 --> 54:48.867
A bit of both, I think.
