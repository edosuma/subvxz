WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.010
Truth is, I'm past saving.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.757
I know how my story ends.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.552
I've been the one out there,
scared, and Dean...

00:10.427 --> 00:11.428
He did whatever he could to save you.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.643
I owe him. I owe him everything.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.437
- Mother.
- Will you help me?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.072
- Kill my son?
- What are you doing?

00:22.231 --> 00:23.278
I'm saving my brother.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.080
Don't tell your brother what we're doing.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.617
She's cracked the code.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.939
God locked The Darkness away.

00:56.181 --> 01:00.186
And He created a mark
that would serve as lock and key.

01:00.352 --> 01:04.653
The Mark cannot be removed,
lest The Darkness be set free.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.570
Hey!

01:50.193 --> 01:51.661
The hell's going on?

02:39.910 --> 02:41.002
Hold on!

02:46.375 --> 02:47.467
Dean?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.419
Dean!

03:00.931 --> 03:02.057
Dean?

03:36.258 --> 03:37.305
Hey!

03:37.801 --> 03:39.018
Hey!

03:43.974 --> 03:45.271
You okay?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.650
Yeah.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.282
Where's the car?

03:54.276 --> 03:55.493
It's...

03:57.028 --> 03:59.201
- About a mile that way.
- What?

04:00.031 --> 04:01.032
Seriously?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.583
The Darkness hit. You disappeared.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.751
You remember none of this?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.672
Hold on!

04:29.144 --> 04:30.487
She saved me.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.444
What? Who?

04:39.362 --> 04:40.488
The Darkness.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.937
Wait a second,
what do you mean she saved you?

05:04.095 --> 05:06.063
You were there.
When the storm hit, everything went dark.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.066
Yeah, but you just disappeared
from the car.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.477
I don't even remember that.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.771
Well, I don't remember
some woman pulling you out.

05:11.937 --> 05:12.984
Well, what do you want me to say, okay?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.272
I was in the car,
and then I wasn't in the car.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.237
I was in the field, and she was there.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.086
And she told you she was The Darkness?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.283
No. She was wearing a nametag.
What do you think?

05:23.698 --> 05:24.915
She thanked me.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.993
For what?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.999
Setting her free.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.083
You didn't set her free, I set her free.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.753
Does it matter?
I mean, yeah, you said the spell,

05:35.919 --> 05:37.921
but I had the Mark, so lock and key.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.886
So, what? Now, she feels indebted
to you or something?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.346
I don't know, she's The Darkness.
Does she feel anything?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.390
And that's all she said? Thanks?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.145
Yeah. She was weird.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.433
But she had this energy about her.
This... This focus.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.727
But, yeah, not a talker.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.270
So, we know jack.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.943
Well, we know what she looks like.
We know that she's evil.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.779
Question is, what does she know?

05:57.941 --> 06:00.035
She's been locked away
since beginning of time.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.787
She even know what a cheeseburger is?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.121
All I know is that we set her free,

06:04.281 --> 06:06.659
and we're gonna put her back in
no matter what it takes.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.961
What the...

06:12.789 --> 06:15.133
- Just gonna let me get in the car?
- You were on a roll.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.859
Don't!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.444
Please!

06:39.065 --> 06:41.113
You think you can kill me, you execrable...

07:30.784 --> 07:31.831
No.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.750
He's still alive.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.526
Don't make me hurt you.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.774
Do you hear me?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.903
I can't help myself. You have to run.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.211
Seen Ron?
He hasn't checked in in a while.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.594
You know where he is?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.577
The hell happened here?

09:37.827 --> 09:38.999
Hello?

09:42.165 --> 09:43.462
Oh, that's not a happy sight.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.918
Hey, easy, buddy.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.680
Just stay cool till we figure out
what's going on here, okay?

09:50.465 --> 09:51.825
Kind of narrowing my options here.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.334
We don't even know what he is.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.146
Weapons on the ground. Slow.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Officer.
We're FBI, okay? We got badges.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.529
Don't.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.861
- Show me some skin.
- Huh?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.654
- What?
- Both of you.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.028
This like a Magic Mike moment?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.283
Your throats.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.198
You... You think we're...

10:15.365 --> 10:16.708
Look, we don't even know what these are.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.958
I need to know you're not one of them.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.790
- One of what?
- Let's go!

10:19.953 --> 10:22.502
Okay. All right. Look. See?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.003
Good.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.509
- Let's see those IDs.
- Yeah.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.169
Whoa.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.094
All right, take... Take it easy, okay?

10:31.923 --> 10:32.970
Bad guys?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.393
Rebar.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.599
I sought cover.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.479
I fell.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.520
Okay, why don't you tell us
what happened here?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.940
911 reported family in distress.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.343
I arrived to find several hostiles
attacking said family.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.241
Oh, God. It was horrible.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.080
How long have you been on the job, Deputy?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.576
Uh... Okay, three weeks.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.745
Okay.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.001
Uh, I'm Dean, this is Sam.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.128
Just breathe, okay?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.085
Speak plain. What happened?

11:04.789 --> 11:05.790
They killed them all.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.168
- Who?
- Road crew.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.631
It was...

11:09.794 --> 11:10.920
They were like rabid dogs,

11:11.087 --> 11:13.681
I fired off a warning,
but they didn't stop.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.932
They were...

11:15.091 --> 11:16.434
You killed all these?

11:16.801 --> 11:18.761
I knew some of those boys,
but they didn't look...

11:19.262 --> 11:21.560
Something was wrong, they were...

11:21.890 --> 11:22.891
They're not human.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.273
Okay, look, I can stitch that up.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.600
But it's gonna be ugly.
You got a hospital around here?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.739
Yeah, up the road.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.280
All right. Here we go.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.956
Well, this is encouraging.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.627
Just wait here.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.806
So, what are you thinking?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.097
I really don't know what to think.

12:02.472 --> 12:06.477
And I don't know what to expect, either,
so I'm just gonna chuck it all in.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.774
This is The Darkness, right?
It's got to be.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
So, what, she shows up
and everybody goes 28 Days Later?

12:11.773 --> 12:12.774
I mean, we didn't.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.576
Yeah, but I was in the car.
And... And you...

12:15.735 --> 12:16.827
You said she protected you.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.331
So, I mean, maybe it wasn't her,
maybe it was the smoke, you know?

12:20.490 --> 12:24.495
Anybody who was outside, like the...
The road crew, they were exposed.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.413
I mean, you saw that. That wasn't human.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.297
So, what, the smoke mutated them?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.509
Yeah, sure. Why not?
Just a couple of hours ago I killed Death.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.170
I'm pretty much open for anything.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.588
But mutated into what?

12:35.797 --> 12:36.969
All right, you know what?
One thing at a time.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.291
Let's just get her some help.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.101
And then we'll deal
with whatever comes next.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.269
I got to call this in.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.937
No, bad idea.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.196
More people, more bodies.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.652
We'll deal with this.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.197
You know what, Dean,
I'm gonna take a look around.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.406
You sew her up.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.696
All right. Do you know this place?

12:59.988 --> 13:00.989
- This way.
- Okay.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.985
This is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.820
I knew those boys' sisters.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
Their parents.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.999
Yeah, well, you did
what you were trained to do.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.328
Sorry.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.175
They don't train you
to shoot your friends.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.048
I panicked. I could've...

14:34.916 --> 14:36.463
Those boys weren't boys.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.254
They were monsters and they were a threat.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.635
Anybody could've panicked.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.300
But not anybody could've done
what you did.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.480
This job was supposed to be saving people.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.100
Yeah, well,

14:53.059 --> 14:55.687
it sounds better on paper, doesn't it?

14:59.816 --> 15:03.411
Well, now that you said your thanks,
let's talk about what happens next.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.076
I like it here.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.241
With you.

15:09.117 --> 15:13.213
I haven't felt this peaceful
in a long, long time.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.510
Well, let's get something straight.
I'm not here to bring you peace.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.004
I know what you are.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.385
Really?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.552
I've been gone so long
I didn't think anyone remembered.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.758
Well, Death painted a hell of a picture.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.678
I don't know this Death.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.772
And he doesn't know me.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.645
Well, you're saying
I shouldn't try to kill you right now?

15:36.811 --> 15:38.438
Am I saying that?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.692
Or are you?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.197
Hello?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.864
Is he dead?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.708
Yeah. Um...

16:33.409 --> 16:34.911
Yeah, he's dead.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.923
It's okay to come out. I'm, uh, FBI.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.584
Here.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.587
I'm gonna slide my badge
under the door, okay?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.357
Help us. Please.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.733
Bollocks.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.868
Old-school it is.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.467
Vanilla spice?

18:08.629 --> 18:10.506
Mam? Down here!

18:12.800 --> 18:13.801
Hmm.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.892
What's going on?

18:22.268 --> 18:23.628
You just sit your tush down, okay?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.154
Just let me get this out.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.233
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.680
And, I know, I lost my chickens
when you put it out there,

18:30.776 --> 18:33.746
but it's not every day that your wife
tells you that she wants to watch you

18:33.904 --> 18:35.281
get a party started
with your best friends.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.746
I mean, am I right?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.369
Hmm.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.170
Go on.

18:42.330 --> 18:46.426
So, I slept on it, and I prayed on it,
and then it came to me.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.465
YOLO.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.262
YOLO?

18:50.421 --> 18:52.469
"You Only Live Once."

18:55.051 --> 18:56.553
- Don't.
- Sorry.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.141
So, I called Dale, and he said...

18:58.304 --> 18:59.806
H-E-double hockey sticks, yeah!

18:59.972 --> 19:01.224
Dale ran it by Deb.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.893
We were only
gonna get buffet, anyway.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.569
And here we are.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.446
I didn't think I'd be this nervous, but...

19:07.605 --> 19:08.902
Oh, hey, hey, don't worry.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.818
- We'll be gentle. Not!
- Oh, Dale!

19:12.068 --> 19:13.570
Hmm.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.739
Any-hoot, it's your day, birthday girl.

19:16.906 --> 19:21.252
You just say go, and heck,
we will light this candle.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.537
Marn?

19:23.788 --> 19:25.290
Everything okay with the car?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.427
On...

19:30.336 --> 19:31.713
It's fine.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.256
Just fine.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.928
The doc said it was gonna be
a tough birth, but Janie,

19:40.805 --> 19:41.897
she stepped up.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.563
That twister hit, the power went out.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.191
She just kept on going.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.318
No drugs.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.283
Just pushed out this little dewdrop
like she was nothing.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.036
Then Janie started bleeding.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.960
They tried, but...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.491
You'd think they'd know
how to stop something like that.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.672
I'm so sorry, Mike.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.180
You think you could tell us
what happened here?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.978
I went outside after.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.186
To collect myself.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.477
A truckload of them pulled up.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.608
The road crew?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.149
They didn't say nothing.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.318
They just went off.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.996
Attacking folks like they were possessed.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.583
I tore back inside to get this little one.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.041
Found that supply closet and,

20:46.203 --> 20:48.456
you know, I've been there since.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.670
I could hear them, though.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.006
Tearing through the halls.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.633
Doctors, nurses.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.889
They didn't care.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.402
You said the road crew went nuts.

21:09.727 --> 21:10.853
Any of them come after you?

21:11.020 --> 21:12.317
Yeah, a few of them.

21:12.855 --> 21:16.325
Did they cut you or bleed on you?

21:20.237 --> 21:21.238
They did.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.469
I don't understand. What are...

21:25.910 --> 21:27.162
What are you saying?

21:27.328 --> 21:32.050
He's saying that whatever this is,
it might be transmittable.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.677
What? We don't even know what "this" is.

21:34.835 --> 21:35.927
Now you're saying it can be passed on?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.588
He's right.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.051
I can feel it.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.057
Inside.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.689
Something's happening.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.067
How long has it been
since you were attacked?

21:50.392 --> 21:51.609
Three, four hours.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.730
Real question is

21:55.689 --> 21:58.533
how long till I become like them?

22:24.093 --> 22:25.766
Brothers. Sisters.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.107
I know I have no right, I have no...

22:30.266 --> 22:33.520
No standing to ask you... You anything,

22:34.645 --> 22:37.615
but these are desperate times,
so ask I must.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.236
I confess my transgressions,

22:41.402 --> 22:44.781
and I will accept
whatever punishment you dole out.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.659
Now, I...

22:48.826 --> 22:50.624
I ask you to help me.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.834
Please.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.624
Save me from doing worse.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.550
All right. Fan out, let's go.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.105
Well, you know where I stand.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.348
No! You're not...

23:11.515 --> 23:13.358
You can't be serious.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.861
And if he goes out there,
they'll kill him.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.813
So, we just wait around
for him to kill us?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.857
Oh, yeah, that's a plan.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.821
Or we just wait for him to die.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.990
There was a...

23:28.407 --> 23:30.535
Whatever you want to call it, a rabid,

23:30.701 --> 23:33.500
attacking the closet door
and he just died.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.498
These things have a shelf life.

23:35.706 --> 23:36.958
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.627
No, he's right.
We lock him up, we find a cure.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.010
This is a hospital.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.262
Yeah, well, call it a hunch,
but I don't think

23:42.421 --> 23:44.674
you're gonna find this
in the medical books.

23:44.965 --> 23:48.139
I didn't open up that closet door
to find a cure.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.014
Look, buddy, I'm sorry.
But this is untenable.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.227
I know.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.399
That's why I thought
maybe we can make a deal.

23:57.102 --> 24:02.108
I'll go, find somewhere quiet
and lay low until this is over.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.863
And you save my baby girl.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.288
Yeah.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.414
You got yourself a deal.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.377
And I thank you for that. I truly do.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.337
But I wasn't talking to you.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.381
I know you.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.011
I've seen you in church
since you were knee-high.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.639
Please.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.349
I don't even own a guinea pig.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.226
It's okay.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.265
There you go, little girl.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.854
There you go.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.567
Thank you.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.901
Thank you, all.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.409
Why do I get the feeling that
that is gonna bite us in the ass?

24:52.700 --> 24:53.917
You good?

24:54.076 --> 24:55.578
Oh, yeah. Aces.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.750
All right, let's gear up.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.919
Yeah, it might be tricky.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.754
What's he doing?

25:44.752 --> 25:45.753
Dean.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.634
- We made a promise.
- To do what?

25:47.796 --> 25:50.720
Charge out there, guns blazing?
We don't even know how to kill them.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.352
She does. Chest, right?
I'm guessing heart.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.012
This is madness.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.477
No. No, that is madness, okay?

25:57.639 --> 25:58.982
This is horse sense.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.771
Save Mike's baby, but shoot Mike?

26:00.934 --> 26:02.174
Tell me where that makes sense.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.696
Look, we can just wait for them to die.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.072
And how long is that?

26:06.231 --> 26:09.451
And then when they infect others,
how long is that?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.988
No. We stay here, that baby dies.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.626
We did this, Sam.

26:17.868 --> 26:18.915
Okay?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.375
We broke it, we bought it.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.293
You know there's no other way.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.216
Where the hell are you, Cass?

26:32.382 --> 26:34.430
Well, I'm... I'm okay.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.845
You don't sound okay.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.147
Dean, I am fine.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.650
And besides, what I have,
you can't help me.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.461
What do you mean, "What you have"?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.025
Just, please, tell Sam.

26:46.188 --> 26:49.032
Rowena escaped with the Book of the Damned
and the Codex.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.659
Okay, forget Rowena. Where are you?

26:50.818 --> 26:51.865
Now,

26:52.027 --> 26:53.950
you tell me, the Mark.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.872
Oh, really? You're worried about me
after everything that I...

26:56.073 --> 26:57.666
Dean, is it gone?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.414
Yes, I'm good.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.623
I mean, I 'm...

27:01.203 --> 27:02.250
I'm not great.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.039
Makes two of us.

27:04.832 --> 27:05.879
This is good news.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.668
- Hey, Cass.
- Sam.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.509
Okay, your turn.
Talk to us about The Darkness.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.924
Why would I talk about The Darkness?

27:14.591 --> 27:15.683
Because it's free.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.937
No. That can't be.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.224
Removing the Mark
opened some kind of lock.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.733
Dean saw her.

27:23.767 --> 27:24.893
The Darkness is a woman?

27:25.060 --> 27:26.107
Well, that's what we're asking you.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.950
We were hoping you could tell us
what kind of DEFCON-screwed we are.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.363
Cass?

27:32.526 --> 27:35.029
Sam, Dean, goodbye.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.282
It may be some time
before we see one another again.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.667
Wait, Cass. Cass!

27:42.911 --> 27:44.913
FBI, my ass.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.723
Brothers.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.789
Took you long enough.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.079
We came as soon as you called.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.419
- What do we call you?
- King.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.218
What about the other white meat-suit?

28:32.461 --> 28:34.338
Secured. We have another team and a witch

28:34.504 --> 28:37.132
removing Rowena's immobilization spell
as we speak.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.634
Mmm.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.470
Is anybody hot?

28:41.887 --> 28:43.139
I'm hot.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.565
I believe that's the menopause, sir.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.235
Thank you. What?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.695
Uh, it's nothing, sir.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.197
Speak.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.235
It's just,
you barely escaped assassination,

28:56.401 --> 28:59.746
you're arguably on the run
from the most powerful witch on Earth,

28:59.905 --> 29:01.532
not to mention an angel of Heaven.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.824
And, uh...

29:03.408 --> 29:04.785
"And, uh..."

29:05.786 --> 29:09.086
You... You didn't call for help until

29:09.414 --> 29:11.337
after the orgy?

29:13.835 --> 29:14.961
Hmm.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.724
I apologize.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.395
For nothing.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.647
Look. I get it. I do.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.130
We're gonna save that baby, okay?

29:31.311 --> 29:33.814
And we're gonna find Cass,
and we're gonna stop The Darkness.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.422
Okay, so what are we talking about?

29:35.565 --> 29:36.566
The plan.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.277
We have a plan. Okay?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.003
It's the same plan as it's always been.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.621
In order to get out, we go through.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.781
And?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.453
How's that been working for us?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.495
We can't save Cass
if we're stuck in some hospital, okay?

29:47.661 --> 29:48.878
Just like I can't strap on a time machine,

29:49.037 --> 29:51.381
go back and tell Cain
to shove that Mark up his ass,

29:51.540 --> 29:53.713
or stop you from releasing The Darkness.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.955
Now, have we made mistakes?

29:55.085 --> 29:56.428
Yes. Hell, yes.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.386
And we can analyze each and every one
of them over a couple of Frosties

29:59.464 --> 30:02.308
when we're old and farting sawdust,
and out of this room!

30:03.051 --> 30:05.645
Right now, all I can do is,
I can gear up, I can head out,

30:05.804 --> 30:10.025
and I can save that freaking baby,
which is exactly what I'm gonna do.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.277
When did we forget how to do this?

30:17.399 --> 30:18.446
What?

30:19.443 --> 30:23.823
Dean, if we don't change, right now,

30:23.989 --> 30:26.959
all of our crap
is just gonna keep repeating itself.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.336
Okay. I don't even... What?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.255
This. This "kill first, question later."

30:32.956 --> 30:34.003
What happened to us?

30:34.583 --> 30:37.553
Hunting things, we're good at that.
Sure, we're great at that.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.088
But that's only half
of the bumper sticker, man.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.600
Sam, I am trying to save that baby.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.261
And what about the others out there?

30:45.427 --> 30:46.428
You mean the ones trying to kill us?

30:46.595 --> 30:48.142
I mean the ones that are sick.
The ones that are dying.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.353
Yeah, who won't rest
until they've infected us all.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.795
So, we just forget about a cure?

30:51.933 --> 30:53.150
What cure? Jenna's cure?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.945
There's always a cure.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.674
You just have to want to find it.

30:56.772 --> 30:59.321
Yeah. How are you gonna find it
if you're dead?

31:00.442 --> 31:02.615
And around and around we go.

31:04.905 --> 31:09.001
Saving people means
all of the people, Dean.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.662
Not just that baby.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.751
Not just each other.

31:14.956 --> 31:19.803
I unleashed a force on this world
that could destroy it.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.092
To save you.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.801
I told you not to.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.307
And I'd do it again.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.094
In a second. I would do it again.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.145
And that is what I'm talking about.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.689
This isn't on you.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.315
It is on us.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.727
We have to change.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.943
What are you thinking?

31:52.035 --> 31:55.335
Get Jenna to the car,
get her and the baby somewhere safe.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.132
Without a shot?

31:57.374 --> 31:59.574
And what are we gonna do
about those things on our tail?

32:01.002 --> 32:03.175
They won't be on your tail.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.683
No way.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.353
You said it, Dean. We broke this.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.863
Yeah. We broke this, okay? We did.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.381
I heard it in your voice
when you agreed to take that child.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.947
I get it. Do what you do.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.282
But you got to let me do what I do, too.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.038
Hey!

32:48.675 --> 32:49.801
Over here!

32:55.223 --> 32:56.475
Come on.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.285
Come and get me, you sons of bitches!

34:17.597 --> 34:19.018
Don't do this. Let me help you.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.099
Come on.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.318
- The baby.
- No.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.070
The baby.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.490
No.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.869
We're not gonna hurt you, Mike,
as long as you leave that baby alone.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.215
- Mike!
- Amara.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.924
What?

35:27.417 --> 35:31.342
Her name is Amara.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.607
Daddy's home.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.531
What?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.196
Sir.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.614
There are rumors from Hell.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.457
- Rumors?
- The Darkness has been released.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.127
The Darkness? Please.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.003
Myth. It's a bedtime story.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.462
Something that daddy demons threaten
toddler demons with

36:49.624 --> 36:51.467
to get them to eat their vegetables.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.597
Even if it was true,
what's the concern?

36:55.839 --> 36:58.513
Darkness, King of Hell, natural allies.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.511
It's just, something happened, sir.

37:01.678 --> 37:02.725
In the cage.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.066
What?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.024
They said it sounded like
a frightened animal.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.529
All of Hell heard.

37:11.688 --> 37:12.940
Like someone was going crazy.

37:13.106 --> 37:17.703
The rumor is that Michael or Lucifer,
one of them is trying to warn us.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.408
About The Darkness?

37:20.530 --> 37:21.577
Ridiculous.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.995
Except, half of Hell
is sort of freaking out, sir.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.041
What do we do?

37:35.712 --> 37:41.685
After Metatron escaped,
we moved the door to Heaven.

37:41.843 --> 37:42.890
Yes. Smart.

37:43.052 --> 37:46.977
You know, to prevent further incidents.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.063
Of course.
I would have done the same thing.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.688
Before we go back,
we need to find a witch,

37:52.854 --> 37:55.357
or someone who knows spell-craft
to remove the...

38:00.820 --> 38:01.867
I don't understand.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.453
You're not taking me to Heaven.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.798
No, we're not.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.491
- Oh. You good?
- Yeah.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.907
Baby. Poop. What could go wrong?

38:43.571 --> 38:44.618
Godspeed.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.206
I have no idea what I'm doing.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.084
Right.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.502
Listen.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.669
I know things might seem dark right now,
hell, call it pitch black.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.258
And you may not be able to see it,

38:59.671 --> 39:02.140
but your way back is right there.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.424
You and her.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.265
You're gonna help each other.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.225
"Joy comes in the morning."

39:13.434 --> 39:15.277
My grandma leads a Bible study.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.115
Ah. Well, let's go with that.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.466
Hey. you good?

39:40.795 --> 39:42.468
Yeah, about 40 miles outside of town.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.804
As far as I can tell,
it's isolated in Superior.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.844
Well, that's something.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.141
What about you? You okay?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.557
What did you expect?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.328
Like it or not, I'm gonna find a cure.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.234
Yeah, I know you are.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.866
Man, things are screwy right now.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.195
And I know we don't have any answers,
but at least we got one win, you know?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.413
Yeah, I hear you.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.324
All right, I'm gonna run Jenna up
to her grandmother's,

40:09.490 --> 40:10.890
shouldn't be more than a few hours.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.494
Then we clean up that town.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.662
We find The Darkness and we kick her ass.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.499
Yeah, that's great, Dean. That, um...

40:17.999 --> 40:19.171
Sounds like a plan.

40:26.132 --> 40:29.682
If you're as bad as they say you are,
why haven't you hurt me?

40:29.928 --> 40:32.852
For the same reason
that you'll never hurt me.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.276
We're bound, Dean.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.699
We'll always be bound.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.112
You helped me.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.242
I helped you.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.787
No matter where I am,

40:52.867 --> 40:54.210
who I am,

40:55.036 --> 40:57.380
we will always help each other.
