00:56.639 --> 00:59.099
I never wanted a war.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.604
I just wanted people
to know what happened here.

01:04.855 --> 01:09.109
Ninety-eight men, women, children...

01:11.362 --> 01:13.447
...my husband.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.991
And yet no one believed.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.541
They rebuilt the town.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.044
Life went on.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.634
But I was already dead inside.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.143
I never wanted a war.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.695
Good evening. I'm Stella Oleson.
I'm a survivor of Barrow.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.658
I've been traveling
for the past 1 0 months...

04:44.826 --> 04:47.703
...trying to find ways
to make people understand.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.831
So l wanna thank you...

04:51.207 --> 04:55.294
...all of you, for being here tonight,
for having an open mind.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.549
The story I'm about to tell you
is an absolute truth.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.678
It wasn't a faulty pipeline...

05:04.846 --> 05:07.681
...that destroyed our peaceful town.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.519
Ninety-eight people didn't die
in an oil fire.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.438
No.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.356
The truth is...

05:17.317 --> 05:20.944
...last year when the sun set
for 30 days...

05:21.446 --> 05:24.448
...our town, Barrow, Alaska...

05:28.453 --> 05:31.788
...came under siege
by a clan of vampires.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.796
That's okay.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.383
People always laugh.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.428
But tonight...

05:46.596 --> 05:48.513
...tonight will be different.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.394
See, they go to great lengths to make
you think that they don't exist...

05:55.271 --> 05:58.732
...which is why every time
I do one of these things...

05:58.900 --> 06:01.193
...a couple of them show up.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.196
Well, l have a surprise for you.

06:05.198 --> 06:09.368
I've rigged the ceiling
with three SunMax ultraviolet lights...

06:09.535 --> 06:12.996
...each of which are the same intensity
and wavelength...

06:13.164 --> 06:14.748
...as the sun at high noon.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.001
If there are any of you out there...

06:18.169 --> 06:21.046
...l suggest you stand
and show yourselves.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.173
Otherwise....

06:24.967 --> 06:26.676
I'm a vampire.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.106
Hit the lights.

07:58.686 --> 08:02.355
-Clever little show.
-Well, people need to know the truth.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.941
That's a good one.

08:05.109 --> 08:09.404
My husband, my closest friends,
I watched them die.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.864
I understand.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.116
And post-traumatic stress--

08:30.843 --> 08:33.595
It can really mess a person up.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.683
All those people tonight,
they can't deny what they saw.

08:40.394 --> 08:44.105
But what they saw was a hoax,
right?

08:44.565 --> 08:48.318
An elaborate stunt perpetrated
by a very sick woman.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.739
If it was a hoax,
then why send in the FBl?

09:07.797 --> 09:10.090
You're a thorn in my side,
Stella Oleson.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.299
If it were up to me...

09:11.467 --> 09:14.970
...l'd choke you with my bare hands
and bury you in the fucking desert.

09:20.768 --> 09:25.897
Others, however, feel that would draw
too much attention.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.111
Who are you?

09:34.615 --> 09:37.284
The body's already
in the incinerator.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.620
No one will ever believe you.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.834
And in basketball...

09:46.002 --> 09:49.879
...the Lakers took a crushing loss
to the Pistons this evening, 1 1 0 to 94.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.133
Rain showers will be intermittent
throughout the evening.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.845
-We'll have relief come morning time....
-Sorry, Eben.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.189
More wet weather
for Saturday evening.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.943
Let's get more information about
that disturbance down on Figueroa.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.502
Come on, give me the key.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.050
No. No.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.874
-Who the fuck are you?
-l'm Paul.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.418
That's Todd.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.670
And that's Amber.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.547
Great.
Now why the fuck are you in my room?

11:14.715 --> 11:16.257
Dane sent us.

11:19.053 --> 11:23.264
I lost my daughter three years ago,
up in Washington.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.142
My mom and dad, right off our farm
outside of Tulsa.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.396
My fiancÃ©e, New Orleans,
middle of the fucking city.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.314
And no one believed us.

11:31.482 --> 11:35.151
Might as well have been talking
about UFOs, Bigfoot, some shit.

11:35.319 --> 11:40.407
Which is why, for the last two years,
we've been out there hunting them.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.243
Hunting them?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.786
Yes.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.455
And we could use a fourth.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.750
No, you don't hunt them.
They hunt you.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.795
See? What did l tell you?

11:56.173 --> 11:59.259
-Where you going?
-This is a fucking waste of time.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.761
Amber. Hey.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.152
Look, Stella, we know what it's like...

12:18.821 --> 12:21.156
...waking up in the night...

12:22.241 --> 12:24.117
...with your heart pounding.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.661
We're offering you a chance
to end that...

12:26.829 --> 12:29.330
...put those nightmares to rest.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.291
You don't know me.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.419
No. No, we don't know you.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.505
But we know you're a survivor.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.593
What was it, 30 days?

12:42.011 --> 12:44.053
And you held on?

12:44.221 --> 12:46.848
You know their strengths,
their weaknesses.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.559
No one's gonna believe you.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.563
You're gonna have to face that.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.176
They found us. Found her.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.887
-How many?
-Just one, so far.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.722
All right.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.351
-Get the door.
-Yep.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.080
Son of a....

13:52.248 --> 13:53.665
Fuck.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.668
Yeah, take a seat.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.921
Time to check out, huh?

14:22.152 --> 14:24.112
The FBI agent...

14:25.114 --> 14:27.365
...he wasn't one of them, but--

14:27.533 --> 14:30.743
Yeah, man, they call them bug eaters.
Wannabes.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.120
Fuckers are everywhere.

14:32.288 --> 14:36.583
They do Lilith's bidding, and in return,
she promises them immortality.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.585
Lilith, who's Lilith?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.464
She's the one we're after.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.050
Queen bee.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.012
You really haven't done
your homework, have you?

14:49.680 --> 14:53.016
I'm sorry. Do you have a problem
with me or are you just always--?

14:53.183 --> 14:55.476
I do. l'm afraid
you're gonna get us all killed.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.313
Easy, A. This is what Dane wanted.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.523
She's like a fucking magnet.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.027
Lilith orchestrates everything.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.112
She keeps them organized.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.406
She keeps them secret.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.992
She also keeps way off the grid.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.996
But Dane's helped us track her here
to Los Angeles.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.833
Yo, if we could take her out...

15:19.001 --> 15:21.169
...the entire network falls apart.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.886
Forty-one, what's your 20?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.977
Let's check it out. Come on.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.730
Let me get my shoe on. Shit.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.112
Jesus Christ.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.657
What the shit is that?

15:50.824 --> 15:52.617
Come on, look at his hands.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.454
Well, well, enjoying the view?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.804
Where are we?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.848
You're gonna meet your friend,
Dane.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.296
-Trouble?
-Little bit.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.424
-Were you followed?
-l don't think so.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.050
No, no way they followed us.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.386
We were traveling, like,
80 miles an hour.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.437
-No.
-Don't. Stella...

17:02.896 --> 17:04.521
...he's not like the others.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.441
Stella.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.405
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.410
I imagine this must be
very unsettling.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.627
My wound...

17:28.047 --> 17:29.464
...was superficial...

17:32.760 --> 17:36.679
...and so somehow l've managed
to hold on...

17:39.516 --> 17:41.100
...all these years...

17:46.899 --> 17:51.569
...to some semblance
of my humanity.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.988
That's not possible.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.574
No?

17:57.659 --> 17:59.410
How do you feed?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.788
Does that all the time.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.456
Fucking disgusting.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.884
Why did you start writing me letters?

18:59.429 --> 19:01.389
Why did you start reading them?

19:02.474 --> 19:04.392
You knew things...

19:04.685 --> 19:07.311
...things other people
couldn't possibly know.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.897
And l wanted answers.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.861
You wanted revenge.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.031
And the only way to get that...

19:25.080 --> 19:26.914
...is with force.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.506
They're old service tunnels.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.050
An earthquake in the '70s
rendered them useless...

19:38.218 --> 19:40.428
...but Lilith has carved them out
as a nest.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.431
-This the only entrance?
-The rest are sealed off.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.100
-How many uglies are we talking?
-lt's hard to say.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.852
I'm sure we can handle it.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.564
Wait, you're planning on just walking
in there and killing her?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.566
Yes.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.735
We got big guns, sweetheart.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.113
We've gone into nests like this before:
Seattle, New Orleans.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.073
Yeah, this ain't our first picnic.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.242
This one might be different though.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.329
Lilith is in L.A. for a reason.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.291
Whatever it is,
I'm certain she's brought backup.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.129
Well, it could be our only shot.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.799
Yeah. What if she disappears?

20:18.967 --> 20:21.969
Who knows how long it'll be
before we find her again.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.597
Use the daylight as usual.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.307
Give yourselves an out.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.935
If it's daylight, what about you?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.437
I don't go.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.064
Right.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.816
-lt's the best time to do it.
-Yeah.

20:35.984 --> 20:39.278
-lf the four of us can corner her--
-lf three of you can corner her.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.322
I never agreed to any of this.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.746
Told you.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.871
Lil-- Lilith, l--

21:32.541 --> 21:36.627
I-- l've detained the witnesses
from the motel.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.052
I was thinking maybe it was time.

21:48.932 --> 21:53.227
She wants to know
about the Alaskan, Stella.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.730
She's--

21:56.523 --> 21:59.525
I sent her packing back to Barrow.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.073
She wants to know
how you can be so sure.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.950
How can l be so--?

22:08.744 --> 22:11.037
Because I threatened her.
I scared her.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.872
She was afraid of me.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.450
Well, what did she just--?

23:07.135 --> 23:08.260
Mind if I sit?

23:16.019 --> 23:17.603
May I?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.315
Go ahead.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.963
So, what's your plan now?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.216
Going back to Barrow?

23:49.553 --> 23:51.470
I can't.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.434
Can't risk them following me
back there.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.478
Yeah.

24:00.105 --> 24:05.025
Home is an unfamiliar concept.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.028
I haven't been home in years.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.117
Your daughter.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.952
What was her name?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.205
Addie.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.040
Adeline.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.710
That's beautiful.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.965
She'd have been 6 next week.

24:31.720 --> 24:38.642
I heard the window shatter upstairs.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.565
I rushed back to her room.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.903
I saw him.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.033
I saw him there in the window
with her.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.828
He looked back at me.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.251
Those black eyes...

25:04.419 --> 25:05.669
...hollow.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.594
And then she was gone.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.766
Nobody believed me.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.937
Not the police.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.064
Not my wife.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.149
Ex-wife now.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.569
So l kept moving...

25:31.404 --> 25:35.282
...but always listening...

25:37.911 --> 25:39.787
...for a story like mine.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.083
That's how l found Todd
and Amber.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.877
That's how we found you.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.131
Lilith.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.552
You said she orchestrates.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.349
They don't make a move
without her saying so.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.353
Not one move.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.774
Barrow?

26:46.605 --> 26:49.106
Hey, you okay?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.191
Yeah.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.862
Shit, man.

26:56.197 --> 26:59.241
I thought we had it bad
back in Bywater.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.871
A lot of desperate people.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.165
It's all right, though.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.376
You know, it was home.

27:13.340 --> 27:17.134
Live just about anywhere when you're
with somebody you care about.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.138
How about you, Stella?

27:23.558 --> 27:26.060
What's it like up there in Barrow?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.614
Cold.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.474
It's a Marine Defender.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.936
There are six in the mag.
You can go ahead and check.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.817
Here.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.777
Bullets only slow them down.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.279
-l know.
-l guess you do.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.468
Oh, shit.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.262
All right?

28:43.847 --> 28:45.556
Yeah, l just--

28:45.807 --> 28:47.307
Fucker.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.059
I'm good.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.730
Fucker.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.110
Sorry.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.090
Shit.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.000
Watch your step.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.081
You guys,
we never go this far from the light.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.588
I'm serious.
This isn't how we did it last time.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.257
Amber.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.069
You smell that?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.405
Yeah.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.498
Shit.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.187
That's real fresh.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.231
Let's be careful.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.733
They could be close.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.776
This isn't right.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.028
This is a mistake.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.654
This is not how we do things.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.282
-We're too far from the sun.
-This is not the time.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.159
-We're too fucking--
-Shut up.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.745
-Do it now or we don't do it.
-We need to regroup.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.747
No, this isn't how we do things.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.498
You're gonna get us killed.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.834
You know what? Fuck this.
I'm going back.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.753
Amber.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.483
Die!

32:31.950 --> 32:34.451
Behind you, Stella!

32:43.002 --> 32:44.419
Fuck.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.051
Amber!

32:53.513 --> 32:55.013
Go!

32:55.932 --> 32:57.099
Hold onto me.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.078
Amber!

33:22.166 --> 33:23.542
This way!

33:23.710 --> 33:24.751
Come on, over here.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.546
Go, go, go.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.056
Todd, you okay?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.684
Where did they get you?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.561
What happened?
What have they done?

33:42.729 --> 33:44.187
All right?

33:46.482 --> 33:47.899
Oh, crap!

33:57.076 --> 33:58.744
-lt's okay.
-Kill me.

33:58.911 --> 34:01.997
No.

34:03.332 --> 34:06.251
Todd, you can hold on.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.295
You can hold on, okay?

34:08.463 --> 34:10.714
Hey, Dane held on for years.
You can too.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.424
I can't.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.467
-l can't.
-Yes, you can.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.469
Yes, you can. You can.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.764
Hey, hey.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.891
Hey, hold on.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.518
Will you--? Todd?

34:25.063 --> 34:27.272
I can feel myself...

34:28.357 --> 34:29.399
...slipping away.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.734
No.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.822
Paul.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.658
No!

34:39.243 --> 34:40.659
You know how this works.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.295
Jesus Christ!

35:02.767 --> 35:04.810
I can't. l can't.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.938
You don't have a choice.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.444
Todd.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.363
Do something!

35:16.572 --> 35:19.116
Todd, I'm not gonna do it.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.034
I'm not doing it.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.789
Look at me.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.212
I'm your friend, Todd.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.339
I know you.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.216
Fight it, Todd.

35:36.384 --> 35:42.556
Fight it.

36:24.098 --> 36:26.766
I thought you said you've done this
before.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.603
Never one of our own.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.688
Yeah, well, get used to that.

36:32.106 --> 36:35.609
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get out of here?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.445
Fight our way out.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.447
How are we gonna do that?

36:40.907 --> 36:43.200
We're low on ammo.
We're down a man.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.620
Well, what do you suggest?

36:47.872 --> 36:49.497
We wait.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.127
Until dark,
until they go out and hunt.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.004
No, fuck that.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.299
Fuck that. l can't stay in here.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.384
I can't.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.555
Can you try not to lose your shit
and get another one of us killed?

37:08.976 --> 37:10.518
What?

37:13.314 --> 37:15.315
-What the fuck?
-Amber.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.110
What the fuck did you just say?

37:21.113 --> 37:22.989
You think this is my fault?

37:23.741 --> 37:25.617
You think this was my fault!

37:25.785 --> 37:27.827
That what you think?

37:27.995 --> 37:31.498
Well, fuck you. Everything was fine
until you showed up.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.005
You'd be doing me a favor.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.438
Fuck.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.464
We'll wait till dark.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.086
Are they still out there?

39:00.755 --> 39:02.422
I don't see them.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.514
Wait, Paul.
What the fuck are you do--?

39:14.769 --> 39:17.020
Come on. They've gone to feed.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.397
Nice of you to join us.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.483
I found a way out.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.941
What the fuck are you doing?
Just kill it.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.116
Where's Lilith?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.627
I don't think he heard you.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.838
Did you not hear me?

40:34.056 --> 40:36.266
Where is Lilith?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.419
I told you.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.213
He'll die before he gives her up.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.635
No, please!

41:12.803 --> 41:14.345
No!

41:14.513 --> 41:16.556
Let me go!

41:19.059 --> 41:20.685
Please.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.985
We didn't see nothing.

41:30.946 --> 41:34.949
Open your mouth.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.452
Fuck you.

41:40.122 --> 41:41.498
Leave him alone!

41:41.665 --> 41:44.918
No!

41:50.257 --> 41:52.759
Leave him alone!

41:53.093 --> 41:54.385
Please!

41:54.678 --> 41:56.095
No!

41:59.683 --> 42:00.850
Please!

42:11.111 --> 42:14.197
What the fuck, you sick bitch?

42:28.212 --> 42:29.837
You want to get out of here...

42:31.507 --> 42:33.716
...tell me something useful.

42:38.013 --> 42:43.101
There'll be another feast soon.
Where the sun doesn't rise.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.728
How's that for useful?

42:51.944 --> 42:54.279
Tell me what town.

42:56.532 --> 43:00.243
Only the queen knows.

43:13.882 --> 43:18.303
They're planning another siege
during the darkness.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.765
Sun sets in three days.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.026
Don't.

43:34.695 --> 43:35.778
Let him go.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.116
You can use him.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.958
Slow. Slow down or they'll hear us.

43:50.210 --> 43:52.086
There. There he is.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.130
How many you think are in there?

44:36.298 --> 44:38.633
I don't know. Could be lots.

44:41.637 --> 44:45.390
Hey, what do you keep
in that bag of yours?

44:45.557 --> 44:47.266
Just 1 2 pounds of C-4.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.937
Good, then we'll wait till the sun's up.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.278
What--?

45:09.790 --> 45:11.833
--the weather.
There's a bit of sunshine--

45:12.000 --> 45:14.335
Temperatures rising into 70s
for the afternoon...

45:14.503 --> 45:17.630
...but we can expect to see some more
of those rain showers...

45:17.798 --> 45:20.925
...by evening time as another front
moves in from the south.

45:21.093 --> 45:23.761
Outlook for the week continues
to be rather gloomy.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.346
Temperatures cooling down....

45:25.514 --> 45:28.015
So, what do you do
when all this is done?

45:28.183 --> 45:32.103
So if you were planning on going to
the beach anytime soon you might--

45:35.983 --> 45:39.777
I used to feel like finding Lilith
was my endgame.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.283
Like it was the last of my business.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.997
Once we got it done, if I survived...

45:51.832 --> 45:54.167
...l was gonna finally go home...

45:56.170 --> 45:57.795
...put on my robe...

45:58.505 --> 46:00.840
...sit on my porch...

46:01.008 --> 46:04.302
...brew myself up
a nice cup of coffee...

46:05.804 --> 46:08.347
...drink it while the sun come up...

46:10.726 --> 46:12.852
...then blow my fucking brains out.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.442
But l don't think like that anymore.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.821
What do you think like now?

46:27.910 --> 46:30.369
Like l wanna put this all behind me.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.873
Start over.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.725
They won't come out
if we're near the light.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.186
Then we'll go where it's darker.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.647
Yeah, well, it won't be dark for long.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.133
Guys.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.267
Shit.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.291
Are they dead?

48:11.805 --> 48:14.473
-lt's okay.
-Help me, please. Get me out of here.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.392
Calm down. We're gonna help you.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.436
Hold still.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.105
-lt's okay. l know.
-Please.

48:21.273 --> 48:22.481
You gotta be quiet now.

48:22.774 --> 48:25.401
What's your name?
Tell me your name, sweetheart.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.320
-Jennifer. Oh, my God.
-Jennifer.

48:27.487 --> 48:32.950
We're gonna get you out. It's okay.
Can you tell me where they are, huh?

48:33.118 --> 48:35.494
They're everywhere.

49:03.357 --> 49:07.610
-Where's the detonator?
-l don't know.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.487
It's gone.

49:11.531 --> 49:12.782
We're fucked!

49:28.048 --> 49:29.715
Stay behind me.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.053
There's too many.

49:37.724 --> 49:38.808
Stella!

50:32.446 --> 50:34.447
Oh, fuck.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.954
Fucking thumb.

50:43.957 --> 50:47.376
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

50:48.462 --> 50:51.881
Be careful. Here, watch your step.

50:55.218 --> 50:56.469
Was she here?

50:58.138 --> 50:59.972
I don't know.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.434
Let's go.

51:29.836 --> 51:31.253
You're okay.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.520
I got you.

51:48.563 --> 51:50.231
You're okay.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.691
It's gonna be all right.

51:57.489 --> 51:58.531
You're safe now.

52:03.703 --> 52:06.664
Okay, ready? On three.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.374
One.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.545
Fuck!

52:15.090 --> 52:17.049
Shit.

52:22.806 --> 52:25.057
Easy, easy, easy.

52:25.225 --> 52:28.227
Joint's gonna be pretty weak.
Could slip out.

52:35.193 --> 52:37.403
-Thanks.
-Okay.

52:45.662 --> 52:47.413
I can do it.

52:48.248 --> 52:50.916
It's okay. I got it.

53:10.854 --> 53:12.188
Where's the girl?

53:12.355 --> 53:15.232
Jennifer? She's sleeping.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.443
We need to find out what she knows.

53:17.611 --> 53:20.946
Yeah, well, she can barely
put two sentences together...

53:21.114 --> 53:24.450
...so let's give her a minute.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.746
All right.

53:29.664 --> 53:31.373
All set.

53:52.646 --> 53:56.190
I haven't felt anything
in a long time...

53:59.986 --> 54:03.155
...except anger.

54:05.784 --> 54:08.452
And that's gotten me this far.

56:31.596 --> 56:33.514
It's Dane.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.308
He's helping them.

56:37.602 --> 56:39.812
I've been trailing them.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.274
I know where they're hiding.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.985
Take care of it.

57:04.921 --> 57:07.339
I'm running out of time.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.468
I want this.

57:12.011 --> 57:21.979
Please.

57:29.863 --> 57:31.155
Show me.

58:07.901 --> 58:11.069
Oh, God. Leave me alone.

58:14.699 --> 58:16.742
Leave me alone!

58:19.078 --> 58:20.245
Oh, God.

58:21.039 --> 58:23.248
You fucking--

59:50.003 --> 59:53.589
They brought us on a ship...

59:55.466 --> 59:57.843
...with bodies.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:01.513
So many.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.601
Some of us they took ashore...

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.646
...to keep bleeding us.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.192
And Lilith, was she on the ship?

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:21.366
I think.

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.368
I don't know. They--

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:27.205
Come on, Jennifer.
I need you to remember. Does sh--?

01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:29.958
Maybe don't push too hard, huh?

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.429
Can you try to remember?

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:46.516
Does Lilith stay on the ship?

01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:52.731
I think so.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:55.609
Do you remember where it was?

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.570
I saw army boats.

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:03.867
Would you recognize it, the ship?

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:32.729
Dane!

01:01:33.147 --> 01:01:35.440
-Take her out back.
-Okay. Come on.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:37.526
Come on. Out the back.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.783
Come on. Come on.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.619
Go, go, go.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.125
Go, go, go!

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:55.627
What the fuck was that?

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:05.804
-ls he following us?
-l don't think so.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.896
Do you see it?

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.442
There. Over there.

01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:24.800
When we get out of here...

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:28.845
...l want you to take this car
and go, okay?

01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:35.268
Stella...

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.814
...we don't even have a plan for this.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.900
We could call the Coast Guard.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:43.902
And tell them what?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.822
There's a ship full of vampires?

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:51.576
We're gonna get on that thing
and stop it from leaving.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.210
And you know it's suicide, right?

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.757
Let's go.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.911
What the hell are they doing?

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:02.082
Is that--? Is that blood?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.238
They can come back.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.203
If they still have their head.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.087
What was that?

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.466
-lt's moving.
-lt's happening.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.301
They're leaving.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:40.513
Wait, wait, wait.
We cannot be stuck on this ship.

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.557
We will not make it.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.350
We don't have a choice.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:46.603
Yes, we fucking do have a choice.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.148
We could-- We could run back now
and we could swim for it.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.108
Then what?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:56.404
This ship gets to the Arctic Circle,
hundreds more will die.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:01.159
Paul?

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:13.171
I'm sorry.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:20.970
Fuck it.

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:34.192
Here.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.113
Navigation room.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.783
-ls that up?
-lt's one level up, three sectors over.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.910
Through the mess hall.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.703
Okay.

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:58.716
Oh, God.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:46.449
Kill me.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.749
Amber. Hey.

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:45.174
Turn.

01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:53.224
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.728
-l....
-Where's the ship headed?

01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:00.398
Alaska. Town called Wainwright.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:01.899
Turn it around.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.069
I can't.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.905
-l can't. l'm sorry.
-Don't say sorry.

01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:11.075
-Just turn it the fuck around.
-l'd do like she says, pal.

01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:13.119
Please.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:16.873
They have my family. They said--

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.252
Said they'd do terrible things.
They don't tell me anything.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:33.890
No!

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:37.602
Amber!

01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.123
Do it.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.312
Paul.

01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:25.316
-How many bullets you got?
-Not enough.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:31.823
-Use them on ourselves?
-l was thinking the same thing.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.237
Bleed them out.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.864
You get to watch first.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.076
No. Don't do this.

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:44.121
No! Fuck!

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.652
Okay. Hold still. Let me see.

01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:03.826
Oh, God. Okay.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.706
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.298
I need to stop the ship.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.612
Do you have any idea
how this shit works?

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.202
No.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.649
I think that did something.

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.362
Paul.

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:24.740
No!

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.466
Stella.

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:56.147
Does it feel like it did in Barrow?

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.236
When you held your dear Eben?

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:07.825
Felt him die in your arms?

01:19:33.643 --> 01:20:31.951
Stella.

01:20:32.118 --> 01:20:34.578
I can smell you.

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.957
I can smell your blood.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.532
I felt nothing.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.580
I could've let the ship go--

01:23:23.748 --> 01:23:26.583
Parliament 454, do you read?

01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:29.086
--and drift into endless darkness.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:32.339
Parliament 454, this is Z-E
Steven Rome, U.S. Coast Guard.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.049
Can you verify your location?

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:36.427
Myself along with it.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:42.016
Parliament 454, did you receive
mass text transmission?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.018
Please respond.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:49.064
Parliament 454, please respond.
U.S. Coast Guard, Z-E Steven Rome.

01:23:50.066 --> 01:23:51.817
Do you copy?

01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:55.487
Parliament 454,
can you verify your location?

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:58.365
Z-E Steven Rome,
U.S. Coast Guard.

01:24:02.787 --> 01:24:05.289
What they found on that ship...

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:08.959
...it was never on the news.

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:12.755
No one ever talked about it.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:25.309
I thought about searching
for more people with stories like mine.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.731
But I already knew one.

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:12.541
Come on.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:45.449
Please, please, please.

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.951
Please.

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:57.252
No.

01:28:39.772 --> 01:28:41.440
Eben.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.445
I can't believe it's you.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.448
I can't leave you.
