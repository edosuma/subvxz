00:10.344 --> 00:13.638
When l was a little boy, my mom
used to playA Portrait of Merle Haggard

00:13.764 --> 00:15.891
every night before bed.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.894
Her favourite song was Silver Wings,

00:18.978 --> 00:22.647
so l figured l'd surprise her
and learn how to play it.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.860
l played that song day and night
until my fingers bled.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.447
Finally, when l sat her down to play it,

00:31.115 --> 00:34.409
she waited until l was finished
and then she said,

00:34.493 --> 00:36.828
"Merle sings it better, but keep trying."

00:39.165 --> 00:40.957
So l guess l am.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

03:03.142 --> 03:04.851
Put it out, Beau.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.269
Yes, ma'am.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.023
Peterson went through withdrawal all over
the dogwood deck. lt's got your name on it.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.608
And Beau?

03:11.692 --> 03:15.612
l don't want to see you
anywhere near Mrs Canter's room.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.601
-The what? The what was wet?
-Go with it.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.396
-What did you get wet?
-The stage was wet.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.398
Oh, the stage was wet, right.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.819
l'm looking.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.072
-That's when it what?
-You keep messing me up here.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.198
l'm sorry.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.326
-You know, here. You just...
-You were what?

04:03.411 --> 04:04.911
-You sing it.
-What were you going to say?

04:04.995 --> 04:07.622
No, that was good.
Why are you giving this to me?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.707
-Go on, please.
-What?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.210
l don't know. Make it yours.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.088
l like that song.
What do you say when you start?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.589
"'l remember that day."'

04:17.757 --> 04:20.677
"'l remember that day. When..."' When what?

04:21.846 --> 04:23.763
"'When we first met."'

04:53.043 --> 04:55.795
-How do you do that so fast?
-l didn't do anything.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.048
-You were there. You had it already.
-Give me that.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.592
"'Timing is everything."'

05:01.135 --> 05:04.387
-Try that one.
-l like that. That one was good.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.247
Kell.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.922
What's going on?

05:39.006 --> 05:42.342
This is Beau. Do you remember him?
He's one of my sponsors.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.095
We were just messing around.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.264
Of course.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.600
Hey, Beau. How are you doing?

05:54.939 --> 05:57.607
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hi.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.779
Beau, would you mind getting
a couple bellhops for Kelly's bags?

06:03.030 --> 06:06.115
-You got bellhops here, don't you?
-No, sir.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.827
Well, then, do you mind?
Because the car's out front.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.627
-They're letting me out early.
-Well, you still got another month left.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.589
-They think l'm better.
-Better than what?

06:21.674 --> 06:23.967
l was going to tell you. l was...

06:25.553 --> 06:28.388
l was just thinking,
"'How am l going to tell you?"'

06:28.472 --> 06:29.806
Beau!

06:30.057 --> 06:33.434
Are you Kelly's doctor? Because the last
l checked, Dr Stevens was taking care of her.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.688
No, he's just being protective.
Aren't you, Beau?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.606
He's just being a good sponsor.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.733
Why don't you let me be the protective one,
all right, hoss?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.485
Now, if you wouldn't mind,

06:42.903 --> 06:46.239
l'd like to get some help with these bags
so we can get Kelly out of here.

06:46.323 --> 06:49.993
She doesn't travel light,
in case you hadn't noticed.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.256
The first two venues are small.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.676
We'll ease you back into it.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.011
And the third?

07:09.013 --> 07:10.972
We're going to go back to Dallas, televised.

07:11.056 --> 07:14.434
-What?
-Yeah, we're going to prove them all wrong.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.731
Look, Kell, you're the toughest girl l know,
so if you tell me you're not ready,

07:19.857 --> 07:22.775
well, then, l'll take that at face value.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.696
l want Beau to open for me.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.906
Who's Beau?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.492
He's that kid you just met.
He's a singer. He's a good one.

07:31.577 --> 07:35.705
Well, why don't we get the gardener
to open for you? l'm sure he's good.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.874
lt's important to me.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.544
Besides, l've already got an opener for you.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.630
Chiles Stanton.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.341
The beauty queen l was telling you about.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.469
She's playing tonight at The Stage,
and l'm going to go check her out.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.640
l'm sure you are.
You can check out Beau while you're there.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.225
All right. Well, how about this? Look, l'll...

07:56.310 --> 07:59.395
Hold on. l'll go check out Chiles tonight
and if it doesn't work out,

07:59.480 --> 08:02.940
and if she doesn't blow me away,
then we'll look at other options.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.901
Don't placate me.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.320
-l wouldn't dare.
-Yeah.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.623
So, where did you find the bird?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.417
Under a tree down there.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.924
l waited 20 minutes for her mama
to come back,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.259
and when she didn't, l swooped her up.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.429
-l've been taking care of her ever since.
-lt looks like a baby quail.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.308
l've been calling her Loretta Lynn.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.108
What if l took her forjust a little while?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.319
l'll take care of her.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.951
You got a really big tour
that you need to get ready for.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.703
Okay.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.955
Hey.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.042
-l got a good idea.
-What?

09:03.794 --> 09:05.128
Let's get out of here.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.760
Let's go.

09:12.845 --> 09:16.514
Nashville's Kelly Canter was released,
once again, from rehab this morning.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.976
You'll remember, the country music star
was arrested last year

09:20.060 --> 09:23.646
for drunk and disorderly conduct
while performing at a show in Dallas.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.774
She was five months pregnant at the time.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.153
Hi, guys. Hey. Hey, how are you doing?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.529
Be careful.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.991
We can't wait to get on the road again.
We can't wait for the tour to start.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.952
Kelly's feeling better than ever.
She's looking better than ever.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.664
And it's going to be fun. We can't wait
to get in front of the fans again, okay?

09:41.749 --> 09:42.957
Thanks, guys. Take care.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.293
James, what about the divorce rumours?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.100
Hey, Beau.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.643
What are you doing here?

10:02.728 --> 10:05.104
l couldn't just wait by the phone
for you to call, could l?

10:05.189 --> 10:08.399
l'm here to hear you sing.
And to support Chiles, of course.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.193
Chiles? What does she
got to do with tonight?

10:10.277 --> 10:14.030
-You be nice, Beau. Find me after the show.
-All right.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.419
Hi, Beau.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.257
You better be here to wish me luck.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.677
l'm on the board.
l'm playing three songs tonight.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.515
-Says who?
-Says James Canter, that's who.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.934
-Bullshit.
-Bull-true.

10:43.018 --> 10:46.646
l happen to be in consideration as
the new opening act for Miss Kelly Canter.

10:47.815 --> 10:51.317
James, my new manager,
booked me this gig as a rehearsal.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.738
Not that l need it. l've been ready
for this moment since l was four years old.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.866
The last time l saw you sing,
you froze up like an ice cube.

10:59.243 --> 11:03.871
That was seven and a half months ago.
And it was just that one time.

11:03.956 --> 11:08.000
l'm not playing county fairs any more.
l'm much more seasoned.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.671
You don't have any songs.
You can't even play the guitar.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.675
l've been writing songs.
l got a whole bunch of them right over there.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.556
Little Heartbreaker, Summer Girl,
Rinky Dinky Town.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.850
These aren't songs,
these are rides at Disneyland.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.358
Clint, tell me Garth Brooks here
isn't opening up for me.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.319
She's not. She's closing.
l can't do anything about it, either.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.948
-lt's your place. You can tell her no.
-Not to James Canter, l can't.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.325
So you're going to let this prom queen
get up on stage?

11:41.410 --> 11:43.703
l mean, for Christ's sake,
Patsy Cline sang here.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.663
l don't care
if she sings Yankee Doodle Dandy,

11:45.747 --> 11:46.831
she's still going to play.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.458
l'm not cutting your set, Beau.
You've got the same three songs.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.212
Don't worry, Beau.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.383
l have no intention
of stealing your invisible career.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.885
You see,

11:59.428 --> 12:00.887
l want one.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.539
-Hey, you did make it. Good to see you.
-How are you doing?

13:10.624 --> 13:11.791
We got a packed house tonight,

13:11.875 --> 13:15.503
l got your favourite spot on the rail right
straight through here, and Chiles is up next.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.046
Yeah, what do you hear about her?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.340
Well, l saw her last Tuesday at Robert's.

13:19.424 --> 13:23.511
And to tell you the truth, l don't know
which was bigger, the hair or the dress.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.263
Hey, she could be a diamond in the rough,
you know?

13:26.348 --> 13:28.224
Well, l ain't got much time for rough.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.184
Yeah, l hear that.

13:31.103 --> 13:34.647
-Kelly's not coming?
-No, no, she needs her beauty rest.

13:35.691 --> 13:39.944
Well, l guess l can tell the bartender,
"'Put the vodka back on the shelves."'

13:43.740 --> 13:45.366
Enjoy the show.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.930
Thank you very much.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.771
What are you waiting for?
You're up, Kilgore. Your band's there.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.565
l was Miss Dallas, dummy.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.943
Dallas, Kilgore, what's the difference?
Go get that career.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.780
-How do l look?
-Like a country Barbie.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.074
Thank you.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.784
All right.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.496
This is it. This is my night.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.666
Everything is about to change.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.543
Excuse me. Sorry.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.463
Sorry.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.090
Excuse me. Sorry.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.927
Here we go.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.682
Hi, y'all. How are you doing tonight?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.228
l'm Chiles Stanton.

14:56.897 --> 15:00.775
And what a beautiful crowd you are!

15:02.903 --> 15:07.073
l have a few new songs for you tonight,
and l hope you like them.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.625
Watch this.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.628
l'm sorry.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.924
Oh, my.

15:27.719 --> 15:28.844
l'm so sorry.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.931
One more time.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.281
Do you think somebody could turn down
the lights a little bit? lt's awful bright in here.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.036
Okay.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.623
Oh, shit.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.291
One more time.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.232
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.641
Chiles Stanton, everybody!

17:53.031 --> 17:55.491
No, that was fun up there, man.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.707
Actually, we're going to work on that.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.173
You two sounded good in there.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.758
Yeah, thanks.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.053
-Do you ever think about doing a duet?
-No.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.013
Her good looks and your song writing...

18:18.098 --> 18:20.683
The girl's more scared
than a church mouse, James.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.518
Yeah, but once you get her wound up, boy...

18:22.602 --> 18:26.230
We're no duo, man. l don't even know her.
l was just sleeping with her friend.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.986
Why don't you go on the road with us, Beau,

18:32.696 --> 18:35.531
get the hell out of these honky tonks,

18:35.991 --> 18:37.616
step up to the big leagues?

18:39.411 --> 18:41.120
l think your bird is hungry.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.246
Hey.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.500
This could be a hell of an opportunity
for you, you know that?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.419
You know, l don't know
if this means anything to you,

18:48.503 --> 18:50.004
but l actually enjoy playing music,

18:50.088 --> 18:53.841
and it don't matter who it's for.
All the rest is just bullshit.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.718
Bullshit.

18:56.177 --> 19:00.514
Why don't you try to play some
of that bullshit in a stadium full of people?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.641
Then see if you got anything, hoss.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.436
l like these people just fine.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.772
l figured you'd say that.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.489
Beau, do you care about Kelly?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.285
What are you getting at?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.913
Look, l know her legs are still shaky.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.541
l ain't stupid.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.921
But l also know this is the only opportunity
she has to turn herself around,

19:33.006 --> 19:36.425
maybe save her life.
And l thought, maybe since you were so

19:36.509 --> 19:39.928
concerned about Kelly
and that you were her sponsor,

19:41.973 --> 19:45.351
that maybe you would come out
on the road and help me take care of her.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.145
Maybe not.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.309
Do you think Chiles Stanton is pretty?

20:27.394 --> 20:30.187
-Now, come on.
-No, l'm serious.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.857
l do. That's why l'm asking.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.529
l think she looks
like a young Linda Ronstadt.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.324
Yeah, well, she's a talented kid.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.371
Do you think l'm talented?

20:49.707 --> 20:53.127
-What do you think?
-How talented do you think l am?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.546
Very talented.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.174
-On a scale of one to 1 0.
-A 1 0.

21:00.051 --> 21:03.762
-1 0's the lowest.
-All right, a one, then. Absolutely a one.

21:04.305 --> 21:08.142
-How about zero?
-Oh, you're definitely a zero.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.144
For sure.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.488
James?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.411
l'm sorry about Dallas.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.791
So am l.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.673
We should talk about it sometime.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.808
James?

21:53.688 --> 21:57.232
l just got one of those Brazilian bikini waxes.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.446
l just took an Ambien.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.950
l'll see you in eight hours.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.841
The first time l heard you sing,

22:25.261 --> 22:28.055
l knew. l wasn't much of a church man,

22:28.139 --> 22:31.558
but l thought that must be
what angels sound like.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.188
l thought l'd died and gone to heaven.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.275
-l love that story.
-That's good. Because it's true.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.288
-Kelly, how was rehab?
-Well, good, l hope.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.832
-ls it too soon for a comeback tour?
-Are the divorce rumours true?

22:55.917 --> 22:58.168
We couldn't be happier.
We've got three sold-out shows.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.380
We've got the hottest two acts in country
music to come around in a long time.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.590
And Texas has never seen anything this big.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.425
Kelly, how do you feel
about returning to Dallas?

23:05.510 --> 23:07.886
l feel okay. l think it's going to be good.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.346
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Kelly.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.933
-Anything else to say to your fans?
-l love y'all. Thanks for coming out.

23:13.017 --> 23:16.061
-Have you forgiven Kelly for Dallas?
-She looks great, doesn't she, guys?

23:16.145 --> 23:18.438
Thank you so much. Thank you.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.774
Hi, James. Hi, Miss Kelly.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.360
Would you mind signing this for me, please?

23:23.444 --> 23:24.611
-Sure.
-Thank you so much.

23:24.988 --> 23:29.157
lf you have any advice for a young artist
such as myself, l'd love to hear it.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.660
-l have some advice.
-And James has been so helpful.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.621
l won't sell it on eBay or anything.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.708
l've just been a fan of yours
since l was a little girl.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.586
Thank you. Thank you so much.

23:40.670 --> 23:44.923
This is amazing, James. lt's so beautiful,
l don't even want to pee in the toilet.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.385
You didn't think this was for you, did you?

23:49.387 --> 23:51.513
No! No.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.473
God, no.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.767
Okay. See you in Houston.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.203
What, you don't like your new band?

24:15.663 --> 24:18.832
l didn't need your help back at The Stage.
l would've done just fine.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.626
l know. l know.

24:20.710 --> 24:24.588
The only reason we're doing a duet
in Houston is because James liked the song.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.340
Yeah, l'm sure that's true.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.354
So, l was looking at the set list
for Dallas and l thought,

24:40.438 --> 24:43.065
what if l close the show with Coming Home?

24:43.149 --> 24:46.485
-Well, we don't have Coming Home, Kell.
-Yeah, but, l mean, Bob's going give it to us.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.529
We've given the guy enough
number-one singles. Thank you.

24:49.614 --> 24:53.617
Well, let's get through Houston first
and we'll see, okay? Thank you.

24:54.202 --> 24:57.371
l love Coming Home. l mean, l think
it should be my next single, don't you?

24:57.455 --> 25:00.624
Well, what l love is that Houston sold out
in 1 5 minutes. That's what l love.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.334
Did l tell you that?

25:02.418 --> 25:06.254
Well, JJ, he thinks it's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, but l don't see it that way, Kelly.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.256
l think that we got a lot of things that...

25:08.341 --> 25:10.676
Kell? Hey!

25:12.720 --> 25:14.971
Do you remember when we were like that?

25:17.809 --> 25:19.267
Did you hear anything l said?

25:20.228 --> 25:22.688
l think l weighed
about 60 pounds soaking wet,

25:22.772 --> 25:26.233
and l had that big old gap in my teeth
and knock-knees.

25:26.776 --> 25:30.570
You were the first boy
who ever told me l was beautiful.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.783
l remember your meat loaf.
Do you remember the first bite?

25:35.243 --> 25:37.285
Do you remember what was in the first bite
that l took?

25:38.329 --> 25:41.623
l was 20 years old, James.
l was trying to be a good wife.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.458
Damn.

25:43.543 --> 25:48.630
Nobody told me, "'First you cook the dinner
and then you put on the Lee Press-on Nails."'

25:51.467 --> 25:55.220
l loved you so much,
l think l would've eaten it anyway.

25:57.348 --> 26:00.350
Do you ever wonder what would have
happened if we had stayed in Bristol?

26:01.561 --> 26:05.105
Yeah. l'd be selling insurance,
you'd be singing in the church choir,

26:05.356 --> 26:07.357
and we'd be miserable.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.611
Kelly, you belong on stage,
singing in front of thousands of people.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.781
You're probably right.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.908
l know l'm right.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.669
Up or down?

26:27.754 --> 26:31.840
l want it down and full. Like really...
Do you remember how it was in Little Rock?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.885
-How could l forget?
-Well, goddamn.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.428
Hey.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.180
You like?

26:38.431 --> 26:40.640
Man, you look like
you're going to kick some ass.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.017
Yeah!

26:42.101 --> 26:44.936
That's what l told them.
l said l want to look strong.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.355
You look strong as hell.

26:50.443 --> 26:53.236
Hey, guys, can l talk to Beau alone
for a minute?

26:58.785 --> 27:01.119
Okay, girls, let's clear the room.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.789
-Just a second, okay?
-No problem.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.249
What are you doing?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.503
l want you to make me a promise.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.796
Okay.

27:11.839 --> 27:14.257
Don't sleep with anybody else on this tour.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.803
l'm serious.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.639
Yeah, well, how's that fair?
You sleep with James every night.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.849
l don't sleep with him like that.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.269
We don't even kiss
with our mouths open any more.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.774
All right.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.692
You're mine.

27:33.861 --> 27:34.945
l'm yours.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.871
Good.

27:47.041 --> 27:50.752
Okay, everybody, come on back in.
l just had to give Beau a little pep talk.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.505
Okay, everybody,
we got 1 0 minutes till showtime.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.508
How many of those pills
are you supposed to be taking?

27:57.677 --> 28:00.136
l take whatever's in the square.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.515
That's an awfully big square.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.143
l've got some awfully big problems.

28:14.902 --> 28:19.030
Somebody get my husband.
l want him to know how lucky he is.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.329
-James, Kelly's looking for you.
-l'll be there in a minute.

28:28.791 --> 28:32.252
-The blue dress. She needs to look her age.
-All right. Do you want her hair down?

28:32.336 --> 28:34.296
Hey, how many of those pills
is she supposed to be taking?

28:34.380 --> 28:37.465
l want her hair up because Kelly's is down.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.009
And l want her to wear those suede Manolos

28:39.093 --> 28:41.511
because l don't like her boots
she's been wearing. Okay? Thanks.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.222
Do you like my makeup?

28:45.016 --> 28:47.434
l did it to make my eyes pop.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.353
Well, you look beautiful.

28:50.438 --> 28:51.938
James, Kelly took a lot of those pills,
all right,

28:52.023 --> 28:54.649
and l don't know about it.
l thought maybe you'd want to talk to her.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.568
God damn it, Beau.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.363
l know exactly
how many pills Kelly took, all right?

29:00.448 --> 29:02.198
Because l put them in the pill box myself.

29:02.992 --> 29:07.829
Now, the only problem with those pills
is if she's mixing them with alcohol.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.998
That's yourjob.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.043
Thank you.

29:16.505 --> 29:20.050
Oh, my gosh. That's from Emmylou.
That is so nice.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.802
Hey. Did you find him?

29:22.887 --> 29:24.721
Yeah, he's dealing
with a wardrobe emergency.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.097
He said he'll be in when he's done.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.267
He had a wardrobe emergency?

29:42.990 --> 29:44.908
lt's an exciting night tonight.

29:44.992 --> 29:49.454
Y'all are the first to hear one of the best
country lineups in the state of Texas.

29:49.538 --> 29:53.291
And to kick it off, we have a newcomer,
Mr Beau Hutton.

29:58.214 --> 30:02.300
Thank you.

30:04.178 --> 30:07.055
Short and sweet
is what l'm going to make this.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.307
lt's called Chances Are.

30:44.135 --> 30:45.593
Are you going to open up any more of these

30:45.678 --> 30:47.137
or do you want me to write out a list for you?

30:47.221 --> 30:48.722
Yeah. What's that red one?

30:50.057 --> 30:51.224
lt says "'H. Roberts."'

30:51.308 --> 30:55.061
lt's probably that damn cookie place,
heard about the diet l started yesterday.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.482
Man, they get you every damn time.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.325
Who gave this to you?

31:09.577 --> 31:12.287
-Did you give this to her?
-lt was with all the other packages. l'm sorry.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.081
Who told you to give this to her?
Get security.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.000
Right away.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.795
l can't get any air.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.673
Thank you.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.133
How about it, ladies and gentlemen?

32:07.218 --> 32:10.470
How about another round of applause
for Mr Beau Hutton?

32:10.554 --> 32:14.099
We need security
down in dressing room A right away.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.311
-What's going on?
-You can't go in there, Beau.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.730
Nobody's allowed...
Nobody's allowed inside, man.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.609
Hey, Kell. Hey. lt's Beau. Open up.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.153
-l need James.
-You're out of your league on this one, boy.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.321
He's with her, isn't he?

32:28.405 --> 32:32.534
Who gives a shit about any of that?
Just open the door. Come on, let's talk.

32:32.618 --> 32:36.955
l do! l love him, you idiot! Get out of here!

32:37.039 --> 32:39.374
Get out of here, Beau.
Let me deal with this shit. Go!

32:39.458 --> 32:41.709
l'd like y'all to give a nice, big,
warm Houston round of applause

32:41.794 --> 32:44.546
-for the former Miss Dallas herself...
-Baby, you got to come out of there.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.841
...the lovely and talented Chiles Stanton.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.653
Those people think l killed our baby, James.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.574
Why would anybody think that?

33:13.784 --> 33:17.704
Every time l think you're close to forgetting,
something happens that brings it back up.

33:17.788 --> 33:22.167
Well, l'm not going to forget about Dallas.
lt's not something you just forget about.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.589
What if we tried again?

33:29.633 --> 33:32.302
l bet you l could still get pregnant.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.429
Kelly, listen to me.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.976
You got a lot of people waiting out there.

33:42.897 --> 33:47.025
Let's just get this over with
and then we can go back to the hotel, okay?

33:47.109 --> 33:50.111
All right? Then we'll get some fish and chips.
We'll get in the hot tub.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.572
lt'll be just me and you.
You don't want to leave your fans waiting.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.783
-So, let's just get out of here...
-lt's never been just me and you.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.328
-Let's just get out of here, baby.
-No.

33:58.412 --> 33:59.746
-Get out of the closet, Kelly.
-Don't!

33:59.830 --> 34:01.164
-Get out of the closet.
-Don't!

34:05.127 --> 34:07.337
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.297
James. James.

34:09.924 --> 34:12.550
l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.844
l didn't mean to do that.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.181
l'll do whatever you want, okay? Okay?

34:19.058 --> 34:20.516
All right.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.230
Will you remember me like l was?

34:26.732 --> 34:27.940
Yeah.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.944
Go on stage, give them hell.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.614
Will you give me a kiss?

35:05.896 --> 35:07.814
Careful of the step.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.529
That's good. l got it. l got it.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.824
The first song, Country Strong, right?

35:17.908 --> 35:18.950
Yes.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.452
Are you all right?

36:39.990 --> 36:42.492
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

36:42.576 --> 36:46.871
the star of tonight's show,
six-time Grammy winner,

36:46.955 --> 36:51.584
the belle of Bristol,
our very own Kelly Canter.

37:13.107 --> 37:16.150
Hold on one second. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.365
Sorry. l just...

37:25.119 --> 37:26.994
Thank you so much.

37:33.335 --> 37:37.588
You just cannot understand
what this means to me. Thank you.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.299
We love you!

37:51.562 --> 37:55.648
l was just in my dressing room,

37:55.732 --> 37:57.358
and l was looking out the window,

37:57.443 --> 38:01.195
and l was looking up at the big, bright sky,

38:01.280 --> 38:04.031
and there are so many stars.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.700
And l thought,

38:07.786 --> 38:12.206
"Man, it looks like they would take
such good care of you."

38:14.960 --> 38:16.294
Do you know what l mean?

38:18.046 --> 38:20.047
Come on, baby, come on. Don't do this.

38:20.132 --> 38:24.051
l never lived on a star,
but it sure looks like fun.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.770
Hey, what did y'all think of Beau?

38:36.482 --> 38:38.399
Wasn't he great?

38:38.484 --> 38:40.985
Let's go. Come on, come on, play!

38:44.490 --> 38:46.491
Come on, baby, come on. Sing!

38:47.659 --> 38:50.328
Oh, y'all want me to sing?

38:58.212 --> 39:00.546
l am going to sing, okay?

39:01.131 --> 39:02.632
l just...

39:03.842 --> 39:07.595
l just feel like l need to sit down.
Would that be okay?

39:08.972 --> 39:13.267
Can l just sit down and just rest?
And l am going to sing.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.064
-Love you!
-All right, Kelly!

39:21.318 --> 39:24.570
l'm going to sing. Let's sing AFighter, okay?

40:50.449 --> 40:51.657
Sing.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.118
Sing, Kelly.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.786
Sing, baby.

41:29.696 --> 41:32.740
We're never going to make it to Dallas!
The whole show's going to get cancelled!

41:32.824 --> 41:35.576
-Would you just relax?
-Hey, where the hell were you?

41:35.661 --> 41:38.412
Where the hell were you when she had
a bottle of vodka in her dressing room?

41:38.497 --> 41:40.581
-l was on stage!
-You were on stage?

41:40.666 --> 41:42.458
Jesus Christ, don't you have
any tricks up your sleeve?

41:42.542 --> 41:46.295
Yeah, don't take somebody out of rehab
before the rehab!

41:46.672 --> 41:48.589
Who the hell do you think you are, kid?

42:04.981 --> 42:06.649
Will you sign this?

42:09.277 --> 42:13.197
People are ready to forgive you, but you
have to give them something they want.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.074
l've scheduled
an emergency press conference

42:15.158 --> 42:18.661
and a Make A Wish appearance in Austin.
The kid's name is...

42:18.745 --> 42:21.539
-Travis.
-Travis. And he has...

42:21.623 --> 42:23.374
-Leukaemia.
-Leukaemia.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.836
Let's go, people.
lt's time to do some clean-up here.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.257
Thanks, JJ.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.844
We'll make it up to you next week.

42:34.928 --> 42:36.429
She better put on a real pretty face.

42:37.514 --> 42:41.642
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.521
Shit. Come on, man.

42:45.814 --> 42:48.858
You know we're all fools in this business.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.915
What are you looking at?

43:06.460 --> 43:10.087
No one's ever going to buy food poisoning.
She's a total basket case.

43:10.756 --> 43:14.091
Why don't you be quiet
and tell me what you're looking at?

43:15.802 --> 43:16.927
Don't.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.352
"'When did General MacArthur
return to the Philippines?"'

43:26.313 --> 43:27.980
1 946.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.275
"'What does 'amorous' mean?"'

43:32.027 --> 43:34.528
Having a propensity for falling in love.

43:35.197 --> 43:37.031
What the hell are these things?

43:37.115 --> 43:39.533
Well, as a woman in this industry,

43:39.618 --> 43:42.620
people have a habit of thinking
l'm some kind of ignoramus.

43:43.789 --> 43:47.792
And my pageant training doesn't exactly
help things, so l have to overcompensate.

43:48.418 --> 43:51.253
You're not the only one who thinks
l'm just some dumb beauty queen.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.964
l'd never call you a dumb beauty queen.

43:55.467 --> 43:56.592
Give me those.

43:56.718 --> 44:00.596
l'm serious.
Anybody that says "'ignoramus"' so casually,

44:01.723 --> 44:04.558
that's not dumb at all.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.730
Why don't y'all just sleep together?

44:09.815 --> 44:12.775
Get it over with. Jesus. Really.

44:21.117 --> 44:22.159
l feel great.

44:22.661 --> 44:24.787
l feel better than l have in a long time,

44:25.413 --> 44:28.415
aside from the food poisoning incident.

44:29.501 --> 44:33.921
Note to self: never trust a sushi bar
that's open 24 hours a day.

44:35.173 --> 44:37.466
But all that's behind me now.

44:37.592 --> 44:41.971
And l just want to say, l'm really looking
forward to playing for my fans here in Austin.

44:42.097 --> 44:43.264
What about Dallas?

44:44.516 --> 44:45.558
Dallas?

44:45.642 --> 44:48.686
Yeah, your last date
will be broadcast in Dallas, correct?

44:51.273 --> 44:52.439
Yes.

44:53.775 --> 44:57.611
We all know that Dallas and l have a history,

44:57.696 --> 45:00.114
and it's not such a good one.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.617
So l'm really looking forward
to changing that.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.619
Thank you.

45:05.704 --> 45:06.954
Kelly!

45:08.290 --> 45:09.623
Kelly! Kelly!

45:09.833 --> 45:10.958
ls this on?

45:13.169 --> 45:15.337
l guess so. l'm sorry.

45:15.630 --> 45:19.300
My parents are school teachers.
l'm not used to running in such fancy circles.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.467
-Chiles!
-Chiles!

45:20.677 --> 45:22.511
-Yes?
-Chiles, who is your idol?

45:23.847 --> 45:27.808
l'm on tour with her right now.
And Jesus Christ, of course.

45:28.310 --> 45:30.477
Kelly Canter and Jesus Christ.

45:31.146 --> 45:32.897
You and Jesus Christ.
Who would have thought?

45:34.858 --> 45:37.401
-They love her.
-Yeah, l guess.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.822
What do you think of her?

45:42.198 --> 45:43.657
l don't.

45:46.536 --> 45:49.204
You're not a very good liar, Beau.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.833
Hey, are we still going to hang out today?

45:54.044 --> 45:55.753
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

45:55.837 --> 45:57.338
So, what do you suppose we do?

45:57.422 --> 46:01.050
Steal a car, do some skinny-dipping,
shave our heads?

46:04.012 --> 46:07.640
Hey, come on.
Let's get out of here and have some fun.

46:07.724 --> 46:09.183
-Come on.
-Okay.

46:12.604 --> 46:13.896
Well, what do you think?

46:14.022 --> 46:17.399
l think l'm Kelly Canter
and l'm breaking the law!

46:18.109 --> 46:20.361
Give me more! Yeah! Come on!

46:20.570 --> 46:21.695
Get it out there! Give me more!

46:21.780 --> 46:25.240
Yeah! l got six Grammys
and seven platinum records!

46:26.701 --> 46:28.410
And everybody knows who l am!

46:29.955 --> 46:32.164
And? Come on, what else?

46:32.248 --> 46:36.418
And l have the best damn marriage
in the world of country music!

47:11.496 --> 47:13.580
Yeah, she's good, James.

47:13.957 --> 47:17.710
Let's talk about the Freedom Tour.
She might be a good addition.

47:17.794 --> 47:18.961
You better hurry.

47:19.087 --> 47:20.587
-How about this week?
-All right.

47:21.339 --> 47:25.843
Look, l was sorry to hear about Kelly.
We were all praying for her.

47:25.927 --> 47:30.347
Thank you, Bob, but she's doing just fine.
She's looking forward to the next show.

47:30.432 --> 47:33.350
-She also loves the tracks you sent over.
-Oh, yeah?

47:33.435 --> 47:37.062
Yeah. Especially Coming Home.
She thinks that could be her next single.

47:37.147 --> 47:39.982
She'd sing the hell out of it, Bob.

47:40.108 --> 47:43.777
The little girl right there is the one
to sing that song. l'll talk to you later.

47:55.707 --> 47:56.999
What?

47:59.502 --> 48:01.712
Maybe we should stop this.

48:05.300 --> 48:07.801
You're married, Kelly, you know?

48:08.303 --> 48:10.804
Well, l've always been married.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.392
Yeah, but just after today, l've been thinking

48:15.477 --> 48:19.480
that maybe l'm just not the best thing
for you in your life.

48:23.193 --> 48:25.152
l want to be, but...

48:28.364 --> 48:29.823
l'm just

48:30.658 --> 48:33.202
trying to do what's best for you.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.163
Since when?

48:44.839 --> 48:47.341
l think the world of you, Beau.

48:48.843 --> 48:53.514
But sometimes you don't have
the faintest idea of how to talk to women.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.406
Hey.

49:11.741 --> 49:14.743
-Do you want to hang out?
-No, not really.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.037
All right.

49:18.873 --> 49:22.209
l just wanted to show you my lyrics.
That's all.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.927
Where have you been?

49:33.054 --> 49:34.555
l was with Beau.

49:35.056 --> 49:36.890
Why do you have a towel on?

49:38.476 --> 49:42.896
We were out and l got so dirty
l needed to take a shower.

49:44.566 --> 49:46.775
Well, that sounds like fun.

49:49.154 --> 49:50.445
lt was.

49:57.620 --> 50:00.581
-Can l help you do that?
-Nope, l got it.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.181
Are you going to let me in or what?

50:21.519 --> 50:24.104
Do you write all your own lyrics?

50:25.148 --> 50:27.357
What is this, Twenty Questions?

50:27.859 --> 50:29.776
How come you haven't got the chorus
wrote down yet?

50:29.986 --> 50:32.112
Because l haven't come up with it yet.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.656
l could write it for you.

50:35.533 --> 50:36.950
This ain't Mad Libs, Chiles.

50:37.035 --> 50:39.953
You can't just fill in a blank
with a noun America loves.

50:41.539 --> 50:44.833
Well, l could write good lyrics if l wanted to.

50:45.168 --> 50:49.504
Maybe l just haven't been inspired
by anyone yet. You ever think about that?

50:50.173 --> 50:53.050
l don't need to be singing
about my Achy Breaky Heart.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.345
Give ln To Me? That's what it's called?

50:58.848 --> 51:02.226
-l like that title.
-Good. Then don't mess it up.

51:02.518 --> 51:06.063
Oh, my God! The Miss America Pageant's on.

51:06.481 --> 51:09.024
l'm just dying for Miss Oklahoma to win.

51:09.150 --> 51:12.194
She's got the best figure,
and she does the prettiest ribbon routine.

51:12.987 --> 51:14.529
l think l need a drink.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.246
-Do you want one?
-Just a tiny one.

51:25.416 --> 51:29.169
How would l change the world
if l won this crown?

51:30.922 --> 51:35.259
l would start by putting country music
on all US outbound flights.

51:35.760 --> 51:40.180
Then l'd change the national anthem
to Merle Haggard's Mama Tried.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.685
This is how you win a beauty pageant.

51:45.186 --> 51:46.770
Oh, let's see.

51:49.232 --> 51:52.609
"'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished judges."'

51:52.694 --> 51:54.611
That's such bullshit.

51:55.697 --> 51:58.365
And then l give them one of my seven smiles.

51:58.449 --> 52:01.702
-Yeah, let's see them.
-Well, l got swimsuit.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.082
And then interview.

52:08.209 --> 52:09.876
l like that one.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.461
l got my formal wear.

52:13.756 --> 52:16.091
Which one's your drunk-off-my-ass smile?

52:16.384 --> 52:18.302
l think you're drunk.

52:19.137 --> 52:21.722
You know, l think we should have
a swimsuit competition.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.558
l don't have a swimsuit.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.519
Well, you're wearing a bra and panties,
aren't you?

52:27.603 --> 52:28.687
Yeah.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.731
Yeah, it's the same thing.

52:31.607 --> 52:34.901
Yeah, l'm doing it. Here we go.
You versus me.

52:36.571 --> 52:38.488
Beau, what are you doing?

52:38.573 --> 52:41.491
Don't be a chickenshit about this, Chiles.

52:41.576 --> 52:44.745
l've seen plenty of ladies
in their swimsuits before.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.748
l'll get into mine just so we're even.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.418
Your turn.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.255
All right.

52:58.468 --> 52:59.801
But no pictures.

53:01.262 --> 53:03.638
l may go on to be Miss America one day.

53:16.986 --> 53:19.112
So, what do we do now?

53:19.781 --> 53:22.282
Build a sandcastle or something?

53:28.456 --> 53:30.999
Oh, my God. That must be James.

53:31.459 --> 53:33.377
-What the hell's he doing here?
-Put your pants on.

53:33.461 --> 53:35.545
Well, it's not like you have
to answer it or anything.

53:35.630 --> 53:37.130
You know l do.

53:37.215 --> 53:39.299
Put your pants on. Hurry.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.640
-Hi, James.
-Hey.

53:47.809 --> 53:50.394
l was just showing Beau my pageant walk.

53:50.478 --> 53:52.979
And he was leaving.
Right, Beau? You were just leaving?

53:53.064 --> 53:56.191
-Yeah.
-Well, that's something l'd like to see.

53:58.694 --> 54:00.570
ls that guyliner?

54:02.156 --> 54:04.199
That's real cute, Beau.

54:09.497 --> 54:11.498
The Statesman's calling you
the next Carrie Underwood.

54:12.250 --> 54:13.417
-Really?
-Yes.

54:13.501 --> 54:16.420
You're on their
"'Top Ten Country Artists to Watch"' list.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.630
-Was Beau on the list?
-Yes.

54:18.714 --> 54:21.716
"'The next Townes Van Zandt."' Who's that?

54:22.677 --> 54:25.262
-He was a singer-songwriter.
-Was he famous?

54:26.347 --> 54:30.434
ln some circles, but not nearly as famous
as Carrie Underwood.

54:36.232 --> 54:39.776
How did you know?
How did you know l had it in me?

54:39.861 --> 54:43.530
l just took one look at you, darling. l mean,
you might as well be holding up a stop sign.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.866
Most people just pass right through.

54:47.201 --> 54:51.538
Yeah, well, they'll regret it.
l promise you that.

54:59.213 --> 55:01.298
Well, you just got to figure out
another pickup line.

55:01.382 --> 55:02.424
Hi, Beau.

55:04.552 --> 55:08.221
-Did you have a good time last night?
-Yeah. Sure.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.765
Yeah, that's good.

55:12.477 --> 55:15.812
l finished your lyrics for you. There they are.

55:16.230 --> 55:18.231
God, how did you ever find the time?

55:19.233 --> 55:20.942
You be quiet, Beau Hutton.

55:23.738 --> 55:26.281
Chiles, me and the guys here,
we were talking about that year

55:26.407 --> 55:29.201
MacArthur returned back to the Philippines.

55:29.285 --> 55:32.412
Just none of us could think of
when that was. When was that?

55:34.415 --> 55:36.458
Are you making fun of me, Beau?

55:37.752 --> 55:41.087
Well, l don't know.
Let me check my flash card.

55:44.926 --> 55:46.301
Yes, l am.

55:50.264 --> 55:51.515
You're an asshole, man.

56:21.170 --> 56:23.630
What are you doing here?

56:23.714 --> 56:25.674
-You're not supposed to be here.
-Yeah, well,

56:25.800 --> 56:28.677
l just looked for the biggest shit-hole bar
in town and there you were, Beau.

56:28.803 --> 56:31.346
You're not that hard to figure out.

56:33.641 --> 56:36.685
l thought you didn't want anything else
to do with me.

56:36.811 --> 56:38.853
l'm waving a white flag.

56:39.397 --> 56:43.358
l got a surprise for you.
Come on, Winnie's waiting for us out front.

56:43.484 --> 56:44.943
Come on!

56:45.027 --> 56:46.111
Seriously?

56:46.195 --> 56:48.613
Yeah. You gotta to learn your way around
a recording studio.

56:48.698 --> 56:53.034
After Dallas, your fans
are going to want to buy something.

57:04.171 --> 57:05.589
What's going on?

57:07.883 --> 57:09.676
What are you doing here, Kelly?

57:09.760 --> 57:11.261
That's my song.

57:11.345 --> 57:14.514
l know you liked the song, baby,
but Bob sent some other songs over

57:14.599 --> 57:17.601
that were much better, much more
appropriate for you. l liked them a lot.

57:18.519 --> 57:20.812
This song, it was too, l don't know what.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.023
-lt was just too...
-Too what?

57:23.107 --> 57:25.525
Too good? Too young? What?

57:26.193 --> 57:27.569
lt wasn't right for you.

57:29.113 --> 57:30.196
l get it.

57:30.698 --> 57:33.491
You can't expect to be the toast of the town
after the way you've acted.

57:33.576 --> 57:37.787
Believe me, you've made it perfectly clear
that l'm not the toast of anyone's town.

57:38.539 --> 57:40.457
-Kelly, listen.
-Get off of me!

58:05.650 --> 58:06.733
Hey.

58:07.443 --> 58:09.903
Leave me alone, James.

58:10.655 --> 58:13.740
Kell, l got somebody out here
who wants to see you, okay?

58:14.450 --> 58:15.909
Who?

58:15.993 --> 58:17.577
Look here.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.170
She's been asking for you all day.

58:28.756 --> 58:30.298
Loretta Lynn.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.468
l'm busy, you know, today, and...

58:36.931 --> 58:41.142
l thought you could take her back
to the hotel with you, take care of her.

58:41.268 --> 58:44.604
You're just trying to make me feel better.

58:44.689 --> 58:49.109
l got to run over to Stanley's this afternoon
and l can't take her with me.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.194
They won't allow it.

58:51.278 --> 58:53.113
You know? So...

58:55.157 --> 58:57.701
lt would help.

59:09.046 --> 59:11.506
Oh, my God, James.

59:13.968 --> 59:17.804
-She's so tiny.
-Yeah, she is, isn't she?

59:20.141 --> 59:22.225
She gets hungry really fast.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.645
So, you should probably come on out.

59:26.981 --> 59:28.648
Okay.

59:31.986 --> 59:33.361
All right.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.348
You must not think l'm much of a man.

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:05.018
l never said that.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.607
l don't always dance for her, you know?

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:13.276
l know.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.572
She used to be tough as nails.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.869
What happened to her?

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.539
l don't know.

01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:30.210
She had a fire in her.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:35.423
The only place she wanted to be
was on stage.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.966
That was it.

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:45.058
l don't know when she got
so goddamn fragile.

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.645
Maybe she's done.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:51.731
No. No, l can't let her go out like this.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:56.820
Then, let's just stop her right now.

01:00:57.947 --> 01:00:59.113
Before it gets any worse.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.406
-No. No.
-Just turn the bus around

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:01.574
and put her back in rehab.

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.619
lt might get better. She can get stronger.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:07.163
You and l both know
she's not getting any better.

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:09.165
You're just talking like her sponsor.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.796
You and l both know
l was never her sponsor.

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:44.951
-Where's Kell?
-She told me she was going to pick you up.

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.310
Shake it, girl!

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.981
Kelly, come on. Come on, time to go.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.817
-Beau! Beau!
-Get down.

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:21.654
Hey! Just give her a break, guys.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.156
-We're just having a good time with her.
-Stop it!

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:25.909
Just listen to me.

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:28.453
-How dare you do that to me?
-l don't give a shit!

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:32.415
Can you get down here now, Chiles?
lt's Miss Kitty's on 38th 1/2.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:35.209
How dare you? Those people are my friends!

01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:37.003
-Because l need your help.
-Come in here

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.338
-and pull me out of a bar.
-l don't care.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.590
-Just take a cab and pull around back.
-Who do you think you are?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.377
You're just somebody's daughter,
aren't you?

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:21.631
Yes, l guess l am.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.385
Whose daughter are you?

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:30.640
Her name is Sandy. l'm Sandy's daughter.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:35.436
She must have done a real number on you.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:37.563
Yes, ma'am, she did.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.774
Don't call me "'ma'am."'

01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:41.901
Sorry.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.991
l always wanted a daughter.

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:50.326
You did?

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.414
l will, one day.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:01.754
l'm going to have a daughter
and treat herjust like fine china.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.009
l'll tell her how smart she is.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.765
And l'm going to let her drive
whenever she wants.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:18.521
And l'll let her get her ears pierced.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.772
l will.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:24.777
l got my ears pierced when l was six.

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:29.157
l had my eye on
these beautiful diamond stars.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:34.787
l told myself they were diamonds,
but l'm pretty sure they were just CZs.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:39.709
My mom said l had to get
the starting-out earrings

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:43.212
and those were just boring old gold balls.

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:45.965
You know, just the real plain ones.

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:51.471
She said l could change them out
if l was responsible enough to clean them,

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:53.389
but she never let me.

01:04:54.475 --> 01:04:59.145
-Well, they sound real pretty.
-Yeah, they were real pretty.

01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:06.360
l think you can have one hell of a career
if you want one.

01:05:06.487 --> 01:05:07.820
l want one.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.824
l know you do.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:16.829
Be nice to Beau, okay?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.919
He thinks he's so tough.

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:27.548
But l ain't ever had a man
be so gentle with me.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.762
He's one of the good ones.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.891
He's one of the only good ones.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.686
Does this mean we're friends?

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.194
No, sweetheart.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:54.033
lt don't mean a thing.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.385
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly!

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:19.225
Where in the hell have y'all been?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.897
Hey! Hey!

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.608
Get a hold of yourself! Come on!
Get it together!

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.735
Let her alone, James. She's sick.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.162
JJ, she's fine.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:41.873
-She's a little under the weather.
-She's done. We're done.

01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:44.625
The sponsor's been pulled. The show is over.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.919
JJ, look. You can fix this.

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:48.921
You know them well. They trust you.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.090
-We go back a long way.
-l just lost a quarter of a million

01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:54.218
in return tickets.
l'm probably not the person you want to ask.

01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:56.012
JJ, come on. lt's not all about money!

01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:59.307
l cannot believe we fell for this shit again.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:02.101
-We got to have Dallas.
-She's done.

01:07:14.323 --> 01:07:16.365
How y'all doing tonight?

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.953
Thank you very much for waiting.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.956
l have a special surprise for you.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.000
lt's a new song,

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:29.462
and l'm going to need my friend,
Chiles Stanton,

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.547
to come out and sing this with me.

01:07:31.632 --> 01:07:32.798
No.

01:07:33.634 --> 01:07:36.010
She's a very talented songwriter
and this is her song.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:38.304
Will you please welcome to the stage,
Miss Chiles Stanton.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.016
Come on.

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.145
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.439
Hi, everybody.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:53.319
This is our first time singing it,
so please be kind to us.

01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:34.609
l have sources that say alcohol was involved.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.194
l don't know anything about that.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.198
Thousands of people paid their hard-earned
money to see Kelly perform tonight,

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:41.533
and they're walking away disappointed.
What do you say to that?

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.703
l'd say l expect a little more loyalty.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.381
Kelly?

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:01.136
-Get out of here, Beau.
-Get the hell out, kid!

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.805
What the hell did you say?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.140
-She's not your wife!
-Yeah, she ain't yours, either!

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:08.978
Get the hell out of here,
you goddamn asshole!

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.566
-Do you feel tough now?
-Get dressed, Kelly.

01:09:14.443 --> 01:09:16.694
You're the only one
that's good enough for me, is that it?

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.071
No, but l'm a hell of a lot better
than that asshole.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.991
You're no better than him at all.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.535
Do you think he gives a shit about you?

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:27.162
Do you think you give a shit about me?

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.582
Knocking on my door every goddamn day!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.501
lf you gave a shit about me, you would
have left me alone in the first place!

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:34.670
l'm here for you
and you're just too dumb to realise it.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:37.423
-You just want what you can get.
-Give me the bottle, Kelly.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.631
-Give it to me!
-No more.

01:09:38.759 --> 01:09:40.091
-Give it to me!
-Give it!

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:45.680
Why did you do that?

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.739
l'm tired.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.158
Come on, let's get you to bed.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.476
l'm sorry.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.147
PBR.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:25.739
Dallas is going to be cancelled, isn't it?
She's crazy.

01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:29.243
She's not crazy.
She's the only honest one here.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.874
Why are you here, Chiles?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.378
-l don't know.
-l'm tired.

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:42.256
-Wait!
-Wait, what?

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.800
Do you want to come in?

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.260
Stop it.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.762
-Fine.
-Wait! Don't...

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.809
Don't make me say it.

01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:55.311
Say what?

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.064
You're being very rude right now.

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:01.400
Tell me what you want.

01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:08.240
Nothing.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.506
Where are you going?

01:13:48.008 --> 01:13:51.385
They found Loretta Lynn's box at the bar.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.846
They were going to throw her out
with the garbage.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.891
l'm going to give her to
somebody who can take care of her.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:03.647
l thought we had that Make A Wish thing
today at noon.

01:14:03.732 --> 01:14:06.692
lt doesn't matter any more.
You don't have to do it.

01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:12.364
Hey, l talked to JJ.
He's going to let us have Dallas.

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:14.366
l can't imagine why.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:24.376
What if l told you l was never Miss Dallas?

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:29.256
l'd probably like you even more. Were you?

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.721
l almost was.

01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:38.390
What happened?

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.561
l choked.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:45.606
Like always.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:54.406
They asked me what my stance
on global warming was,

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:58.243
and all l could think of was a planet
in a big, old sweater

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.496
my grandma used to make me.

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:05.834
l'm sure that would have kept
the whole world nice and warm.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:13.926
Do you still like me?

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:17.096
l still like you.

01:15:18.098 --> 01:15:21.600
-l'm serious, Beau.
-l still like you.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.437
But l'm not what l seem.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.108
Well, maybe that's what l like about you.

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.611
-Did you ever think of that?
-No.

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:41.036
Maybe that's what makes you different
from all those other pretty pennies out there.

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:51.130
lt's just going to be a few minutes
of your time, okay, Mrs Canter?

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.841
Just take a couple of photos with the boy
and we'll have you on your way.

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:56.301
-Okay.
-lt's right down here.

01:15:56.386 --> 01:15:59.638
-Do you need a coffee?
-No, l'm fine. Thank you.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.474
Hi.

01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:07.479
Thank you so much for coming.
lt just means the world to us.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:11.233
lt's my pleasure. Thank you. Which one is...

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.318
-ls that Travis there?
-He's right over there.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:14.653
Okay.

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.244
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:23.954
-Are you Travis?
-Yes.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.748
-Do you mind if l sit down?
-No.

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.666
Okay.

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:31.086
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:16:31.171 --> 01:16:33.338
-ls this your class?
-Yes.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.175
-Do you have any fun in here?
-Yes.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:37.551
You do?

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:42.055
-That's good. Thanks for inviting me.
-You're welcome.

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:44.308
Tell her how much
you love her music, Travis.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:45.976
Are you going to play a song for me?

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.063
What? Am l going to play a song for you?

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:54.359
-No, you don't have to.
-Yes, l am.

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:57.029
l am. That's why l brought my guys.

01:16:58.198 --> 01:17:00.032
Come on in, guys.

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:06.288
There's just one little thing
which is, l wrote this new song,

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.541
and l'm not sure if it's any good, so l was...

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:11.919
Thanks.

01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:15.798
l was hoping that l could play it for you
and you tell me what you think, okay?

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.049
Okay.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.717
lt's called Travis.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.221
And it goes like this.

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:04.888
-What did you think?
-ls it over?

01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:07.432
Travis. l'm sorry.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:11.436
ls it... No. No, it's not, is it? No.

01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:14.982
We got a whole other part. Don't we, guys?

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:19.611
And it goes like...

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.859
What do you say?
Would you dance with me for real?

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:01.194
You would? Oh, my gosh.

01:19:01.321 --> 01:19:04.823
Come on, boys, bring it home.
This is my lucky day.

01:19:05.867 --> 01:19:08.243
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

01:19:09.329 --> 01:19:11.246
Show me what you got.

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.210
Come on, guys!
Are you going to dance with us?

01:19:20.006 --> 01:19:22.925
Let's see your moves on the floor now.

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:26.553
Oh, yeah. l like those moves.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.352
Okay, bring it home for me.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:38.690
Yeah.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.998
l'm Nick Beres reporting live
outside the downtown arena

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:03.960
where country music superstar Kelly Canter
is set to arrive any moment.

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:07.130
Mrs Canter came down
with food poisoning in Houston.

01:22:07.215 --> 01:22:09.216
She didn't show up in Austin.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.344
But her fans here have not given up hope.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.972
Almost a year ago today,

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:18.350
Kelly Canter performed
at this very same arena

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:22.521
in what became the most talked about
performance of the year.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:26.483
Mrs Canter, who was five months pregnant,
tripped over a microphone cord

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.902
and fell 10 feet off the edge of the stage.

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:32.197
She had a blood-alcohol level
of .1 9 at the time.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.615
She's hit rock bottom.

01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:36.952
And sometimes you have to hit rock bottom
to realise what you had.

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:40.122
And l think she's going to come back.
Better than ever.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.924
l was here last year
when it all fell apart for Kelly.

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:53.635
l mean,
how many chances can someone get?

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:56.138
l don't know. Let's ask the fans out there.
What do you think?

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:58.598
Are you ready to hear Kelly's big encore?

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:19.035
-You can't afford these.
-Don't worry about that.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.329
-l can't take these.
-Put them on.

01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:24.374
-No.
-Put them on. l want to see them on.

01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:39.973
Better than gold balls?

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:43.560
Yeah.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.733
l'm leaving after the show,
heading to California.

01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:50.901
Why?

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:53.195
There's an opportunity for me out there.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:57.157
A friend of a friend
has got a ranch on the beach

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.576
and needs somebody to help him out.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.494
Somebody like you.

01:24:02.455 --> 01:24:03.955
And you.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.584
-What about our music?
-That's the best part.

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:12.422
There's this bar right in the centre of town
that just lost its Saturday night lineup,

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:14.883
and l know it's not a 1 0-city tour or anything,

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:18.803
but it's a bunch of hard-working people
that like to listen to good music

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.305
while they drink their beer.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:24.809
l just figured
maybe we could write during the day,

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:27.145
see if we come up with anything,

01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:29.522
enough to write an album.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:33.360
l already have enough songs
to make an album.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.492
lf you want to sing those country pop songs,
you go right ahead.

01:24:40.952 --> 01:24:43.703
-But you're better than that, Chiles.
-No, l'm not.

01:24:43.788 --> 01:24:47.415
Yes, you are. l swear it. Just because
they might put them on the radio

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.792
it doesn't mean they're worth a damn.

01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:01.638
l've never seen the beach before.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.515
So come with me.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:11.064
Okay.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:17.279
You will?

01:25:23.828 --> 01:25:27.455
-We're ready for you, Beau.
-All right.

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:31.584
Okay.

01:25:36.424 --> 01:25:37.674
Beau.

01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:43.430
What if you gave me a little time
to think about it?

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:50.812
You take all the time you need.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.817
Good evening, Dallas.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.611
Welcome to the Kelly Canter Encore Tour.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:01.990
Now, to start things off,

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:06.411
let's hear it for the man you fell in love with
back in Nashville,

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.621
Beau Hutton!

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.595
l love you, Beau!

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.931
l'd like to dedicate this first song
to Kelly Canter.

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:31.394
She's the reason l'm here. She's a true talent.

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:36.566
This one's not on the set list,
but that doesn't mean it isn't pretty.

01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:38.985
This one's for you, Kelly.

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:25.907
Pretty.

01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:28.201
Thank you.

01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:32.163
-You got a pen and paper?
-Yeah, sure.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:35.375
l've been thinking of some things
that l want to tell you.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:36.709
Okay.

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:45.260
Don't ever wear satin on stage
'cause it wrinkles like anything,

01:27:45.344 --> 01:27:50.390
and your sweat will show right through it,
l don't care how pretty the dress is.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.562
Always travel with your costumes
and if anything ever needs mending,

01:27:55.646 --> 01:27:59.816
send it to Arturo in Beverly Hills.
He's the best.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:03.361
Don't take laxatives ever

01:28:03.446 --> 01:28:06.156
because they never work
the way you want them to.

01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:11.619
Don't drink anything carbonated
on a show day.

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:13.580
Okay? lt'll make you bloat.

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:17.542
Wear high heels everywhere you go.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:20.378
And when it comes to
writing your own songs,

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:22.130
don't get too concerned about it, all right?

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:25.592
Your motto should always be,
"'The best song wins."'

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.930
And don't be afraid to fall in love.

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:37.854
lt's the only thing that matters in life.

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:42.025
The only thing.
Do you understand what l'm telling you?

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.861
Yeah.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:49.908
You just fall in love
with as many things as possible.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:29:00.293
You're going to have to find a way
to tell people about your parents

01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:02.795
'cause they're not school teachers, are they?

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:10.720
Have either one of them been in prison
for anything violent?

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:13.598
Yeah.

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:17.727
Are they out?

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:21.064
My mom is.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:27.904
Well, you got to work with a publicist

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:31.366
and decide the best way to get it out.

01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:36.871
You never want to hide anything
from your fans. lt's just not worth it.

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:41.167
Okay?

01:29:42.753 --> 01:29:44.045
Okay.

01:29:49.927 --> 01:29:51.636
How did you know?

01:29:55.808 --> 01:29:58.142
l just had a feeling.

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:55.700
Thank you very much.

01:30:57.536 --> 01:30:59.329
We got somebody special coming up.

01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:02.040
l want you to give a warm welcome
to Miss Chiles Stanton.

01:31:05.002 --> 01:31:11.090
Wow. That is a welcome dreams are made of.
Thank y'all so much.

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:14.719
Mr Beau Hutton, everyone. lsn't he the best?

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:55.385
Hey. Thanks for the song.

01:31:55.469 --> 01:31:57.470
You might have been the only one
that liked it.

01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:59.681
Come on, now.

01:32:08.482 --> 01:32:12.819
-l guess they're not buying the bad shrimp.
-Yeah, l guess not.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:16.656
-Do you think l'm crazy?
-No.

01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:21.703
l just don't think love and fame
can live in the same place.

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:26.290
l loved that baby, too, Beau.

01:32:28.544 --> 01:32:32.171
l was sadder than anybody when l lost it.

01:32:35.843 --> 01:32:37.844
l can't change my past.

01:32:38.846 --> 01:32:41.764
You know? l can't change how much l drank.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.938
l'm stronger than all this.
You know that, right?

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:50.982
l know.

01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.986
l'm going to give them one hell of a show.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:56.946
l thought you would.

01:32:58.532 --> 01:32:59.949
Come here.

01:34:18.946 --> 01:34:21.155
You got a full house out there.

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:23.574
l heard.

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:38.548
l've never loved anybody like l loved you.

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:43.386
You know that, right?

01:34:49.142 --> 01:34:51.936
Let's just get through tonight, okay?

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.323
Hey, Dove.

01:35:08.787 --> 01:35:11.330
Give them hell tonight, okay?

01:35:50.746 --> 01:35:53.664
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:35:53.749 --> 01:35:58.169
let's welcome back to Dallas
the lady you've been waiting to see,

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:01.964
the belle of Bristol, six-time Grammy winner,

01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:06.427
country superstar Kelly Canter.

01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:07.191
Yeah!

01:42:39.321 --> 01:42:41.905
That's how it's done, sweetheart.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.424
Okay?

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:50.391
Okay, we got The Chronicle here.
They want pictures. Chiles, you, too.

01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:55.938
Earlier tonight,
this stadium pulsed with excitement

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:59.900
over an incredible performance
by country superstar Kelly Canter.

01:43:59.984 --> 01:44:04.613
But it still begs the inevitable question,
"'How long will her sobriety last?"'

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.660
Fill it up! Let's go!

01:44:11.079 --> 01:44:12.371
-James.
-Yeah.

01:44:12.455 --> 01:44:14.623
Hi. What can we expect next from Kelly?

01:44:14.707 --> 01:44:17.042
Well, more songs, more shows,

01:44:17.127 --> 01:44:19.086
and a hell of a lot more
of what we saw tonight.

01:44:19.671 --> 01:44:21.672
-Beau, look this way!
-Beau, right here!

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:24.925
Well done, James. lt looks like Kelly's
going to get her encore after all.

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:27.219
Well, now, we couldn't have done it
without you, could we?

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.972
Thanks, man. l'll see you in Nashville.
We'll talk about some more dates.

01:44:30.056 --> 01:44:32.015
Yeah, JJ. All right. Yeah, thanks.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.810
-Who needs a drink?
-Right here. One for me, one for you.

01:44:34.894 --> 01:44:36.728
Next week, l'm recording my new single,

01:44:36.813 --> 01:44:40.899
and hopefully continuing
on this amazing tour.

01:44:40.984 --> 01:44:42.067
-Hey, Beau.
-Where's Kell?

01:44:42.152 --> 01:44:43.444
Jesse Clark of Country FM.

01:44:43.528 --> 01:44:45.571
She's just cleaning up a bit.
She'll be back out.

01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:48.490
Great set. How does it feel
to have your career change overnight?

01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:09.011
Kell? Kell...

01:45:14.309 --> 01:45:17.978
Kell? Kell. Kelly!

01:45:21.316 --> 01:45:24.234
Kelly. Hey, Kelly.

01:45:25.153 --> 01:45:28.113
What did you take?
Kelly, how many did you take? Kelly!

01:45:28.573 --> 01:45:31.909
Come on, wake up. Wake up.
How many did you take, Kelly?

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:12.903
Dear Beau.

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:17.157
You once told me that love and fame
can't live in the same place.

01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:20.535
lf that is true,
there's only one choice to make,

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.414
especially for someone as gentle
and loving as you.

01:48:24.499 --> 01:48:28.085
l don't regret a single moment
we spent together.

01:48:28.169 --> 01:48:31.630
You filled my last days with true happiness.

01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:33.632
So choose love.

01:48:34.342 --> 01:48:37.094
Take off and don't look back.

01:48:37.178 --> 01:48:41.515
Because there is no one
more worthy of love than you.
