love him, right?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.517
But if you fake it,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.853
I won't be able
to tell the difference.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.321
So I'll feel good.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.523
And then eventually,
maybe,

18:45.525 --> 18:47.825
You'll actually
start to love me again.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.627
- You really think
we can get that back?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.130
- Yes.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.134
Come on.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.536
Totally.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.347
Maybe we should cancel
that bottle of wine tonight.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.548
- Oh?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.150
- Yeah, I just feel like

19:12.152 --> 19:13.751
I got a bunch of stuff to do
in philly,

19:13.753 --> 19:17.355
And I'm sure you have
stuff to do, so we can just...

19:17.357 --> 19:20.424
Drop me
at the bus station?

19:20.426 --> 19:23.661
- I just feel like
we're gonna fight.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.363
- Yeah.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.832
- So...

19:27.834 --> 19:29.233
How 'bout let's not?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.936
- Okay.

19:33.705 --> 19:38.342
- Oh, um...

19:38.344 --> 19:41.212
Happy valentine's day.

19:41.214 --> 19:46.284
Sorry. I didn't
have time to wrap it.

19:47.886 --> 19:51.222
- Wow.
I didn't know you kept this.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.391
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.460
- No problem.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.500
- I don't think you should
go to philly tonight.

20:02.502 --> 20:06.204
I think that you should stay,
and I think we should fight.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.540
- You really want to fight
on valentine's day?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.709
- Yeah, I do.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.315
- Okay.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.417
All right,
put your dukes up, beesly.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.789
- Hi.

20:24.791 --> 20:28.226
- Hey, you okay?

20:28.228 --> 20:31.429
- I couldn't do it.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.331
- Oh.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.899
- I'm sorry.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.534
- Oh, you don't
have to apologize.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.505
I just--I just want you
to be happy, okay?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.818
[chuckles]

20:58.557 --> 21:00.658
- We're breaking up.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.395
And just so you know,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.397
I was worried
that you were dead.

21:06.399 --> 21:10.034
You were gone
for three months.

21:12.304 --> 21:16.407
- Andy? David. Still here.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.477
What was that
about three months?
