00:43.811 --> 00:46.545
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.181
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.117
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.720
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.642
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.678
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.046
Release your presence in...

01:23.350 --> 01:27.753
Shove that cross up your ass.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.867
You're going to Hell, priest.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.204
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.242
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.377
You're not welcome here.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.912
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.082
You're not welcome here!

02:08.026 --> 02:09.193
You're not welcome here.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.897
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.533
You're not welcome here!

02:14.535 --> 02:16.301
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

02:16.303 --> 02:20.105
She belongs to us, now.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.408
Release your presence in the name of the Lord!

02:29.649 --> 02:31.517
Father, she is lost.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.753
Your God have no presence here.

04:15.888 --> 04:19.091
Release your presence
in the name of the Lord.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.726
Release your presence in the name of the Lord.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.432
Father Connely?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.068
Father?

05:37.837 --> 05:42.774
â™ª Hallelujah â™ª

07:54.407 --> 07:56.141
So I don't see a ring...

07:56.943 --> 08:01.146
... any friends or girlfriends, so, um...

08:05.084 --> 08:07.252
You wanna get outta here?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.454
Hell yeah.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.567
Go away.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.802
Clean in the morning.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.338
Rise and shine, Jason.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.140
What the...

09:06.312 --> 09:08.446
What do you want, Diekmen?

09:11.217 --> 09:14.252
Thought I'd stop by and provide you
with a little support.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.055
I figured you'd need it on a day like today.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.991
You really should count your blessings,
you know that?

09:21.661 --> 09:25.130
You've been allowed to see yet another day.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.738
Maybe you didn't hear me earlier...

09:33.740 --> 09:35.574
What do you want?

09:37.543 --> 09:39.744
We leave in a few hours.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.057
Will your lady friend be joining us?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.092
That's, uh... Julia.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.461
Nah, I don't think she will be.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.431
Shall I wake her?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.765
Nah.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.437
I got an open door policy.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.305
She can let herself out.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.507
Ah, I see.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.950
Shall we go then?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.953
After you.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.763
Eddie Bunkley...

10:31.765 --> 10:33.832
Do you understand
why I made the decision

10:33.834 --> 10:36.735
on wether or not
to accept your plea deal,

10:36.737 --> 10:38.937
and why it would
be made public?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.005
Yes, your honor.

10:40.007 --> 10:44.609
Then you also understand
that I cannot ignore the D.A.'s excursion

10:44.611 --> 10:46.911
of your last stint as a free man?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.980
The man who entered prison
ten years ago

10:48.982 --> 10:50.415
was lost and without faith.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.185
Now that don't make what I did right,

10:54.187 --> 10:56.187
but I am a better man, your honor.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.424
Given the reports of your good behavior

10:59.426 --> 11:02.360
and taking into consideration
the intel you provided

11:02.362 --> 11:05.864
through your co-operation
on a high profile case,

11:05.866 --> 11:08.433
it is the state
and the court's decision

11:08.435 --> 11:10.702
to grant you your release.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.280
Jason.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.349
Not now, old man.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.218
I've had enough of your God's justice
for one day.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.054
Without forgiveness, there can be no love.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.555
Can't you see that?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.023
You should feel proud we live in a place

11:32.025 --> 11:35.193
where we don't hold darkness
in our hearts.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.295
What I see, Father,
is that you and people like you

11:37.297 --> 11:38.930
are no better than he is.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.965
that just got off for killing my family,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.468
so don't tell me how I should feel.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.036
I'm not a little kid anymore,
and Dad's not around

11:45.038 --> 11:47.872
to help force feed me
your religious bullshit.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.043
You must learn to forgive,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.979
or the darkness will consume you
from within.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.017
Father Connely is dead.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.458
I need you to come to the old church
where you grew up.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.460
A lot has changed.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.029
I have something of your father's,

12:11.031 --> 12:12.931
that he wanted you to have.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.450
I can't breathe when you hold
my head down like that, Roddy.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.252
Cindy...

12:34.254 --> 12:35.787
... baby...

12:35.789 --> 12:38.089
... I'm just trying to make sure
you do it right.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.758
That's all.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.095
You're so cute when you think
I'm mad at you.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.250
What the hell, Roddy?!

13:39.252 --> 13:40.585
- Well good grief, baby!
- That kinda hurt.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.120
Well good grief, baby!

13:42.122 --> 13:45.089
There's a dumb son of a bitch
in the middle of the road.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.994
Well, maybe he's sick or something.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.331
Hey, buddy!

13:54.033 --> 13:56.367
Move your ass outta the road!

13:57.636 --> 13:58.837
Babe...

13:58.839 --> 14:00.839
Just go around.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.273
Nah, I ain't gonna stand for this shit.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.175
Hey!

14:04.177 --> 14:07.011
Move your ass outta the road!

14:15.322 --> 14:16.921
Hey... hey!

14:19.125 --> 14:21.526
- Babe, what's going on?
- What are you doing?

14:56.228 --> 14:58.529
It's all a bit much, isn't it?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.565
Most churches have
Bibles and crucifixes,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.367
not swords and...

15:04.671 --> 15:06.137
... okay.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.911
I see you remembered how to get here.

15:14.179 --> 15:17.248
It's not Sunday, so I'm not missing
any games.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.884
Thought I'd come turn a little water
into wine.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.855
After you.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.895
The very basis of our belief

15:30.897 --> 15:33.097
stems from the arrival
of the Apostles,

15:33.099 --> 15:37.135
from such places as Jerusalem,
Africa and even Asia.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.005
With the spread of Christianity
throughout the Roman Empire.

15:42.775 --> 15:47.445
Upon the turn of the second
century, the Papacy, as you know it today,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.314
was constantly ever-changing.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.484
With one central point
being our Savior, Jesus Christ.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.887
You're killing me, man.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.089
Upon the destruction
of the western Roman Empire,

15:58.091 --> 16:00.124
the church in the West was a
major factor

16:00.126 --> 16:02.093
in preserving classical civilizations;

16:02.095 --> 16:04.329
establishing monasteries,
and sending missionaries

16:04.331 --> 16:06.297
to the people
of far northern Europe...

16:07.466 --> 16:09.534
... as far as Ireland, in the North.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.670
So what exactly is your point?

16:13.739 --> 16:17.742
My point, Jason, is what isn't written
or taught

16:17.744 --> 16:19.911
is the existence of an establishment,

16:19.913 --> 16:21.479
<i>Esorcistato,</i>

16:21.481 --> 16:23.848
which was created during ancient times

16:23.850 --> 16:27.618
to combat the dealings
of <i>Daemon Everto Possessio,</i>

16:27.620 --> 16:31.389
or as you know it,
"demonic possessions."

16:31.391 --> 16:33.291
A rite formed,

16:33.293 --> 16:35.460
to monitor and perform exorcisms

16:35.462 --> 16:37.161
on the damned...

16:37.696 --> 16:40.365
... known as The Cloth.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.668
"The Cloth."

16:43.670 --> 16:45.436
So what you're telling me
is there's a group of old people

16:45.438 --> 16:49.340
out there wandering the globe,
aimlessly fighting a war with the devil?

16:52.311 --> 16:54.178
It's not as simple as that, but...

16:54.180 --> 16:56.814
Basically, that's what I'm saying, yes.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.716
Okay, wow.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.852
Diekmen, I knew you were crazy,

17:00.854 --> 17:01.786
but this?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.422
This is a stretch, even for you.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.358
Spinning their heads,
spittin' up pea soup...

17:08.361 --> 17:10.528
<i>Ephpeta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

17:10.530 --> 17:11.429
Be open.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.225
<i>Appropinquabit enim judicium dei.</i>

17:41.227 --> 17:42.693
What is this place?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.395
<i>Appropinquabit...</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:46.197
Jason, be still.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.566
Don't move.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.472
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

17:56.475 --> 17:58.776
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

18:02.281 --> 18:04.715
It's alright, Jason.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.418
Her name is Nybass.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.521
Mind your eyes!

18:10.523 --> 18:13.091
She's an amphonxious spiritous.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.192
What is it?

18:15.561 --> 18:18.262
Two spirits, one body.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.764
One good...

18:20.966 --> 18:22.500
... and one bad.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.836
Where'd she come from?

18:26.138 --> 18:27.805
Texas.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.409
What you see before you

18:31.411 --> 18:33.544
is someone who is possessed,

18:33.546 --> 18:35.546
and in a rare case,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.949
found herself battling
within her own body.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.118
She managed to keep
some of her motor functions

18:40.120 --> 18:44.522
and cognitive functions
separate from the demon within her.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.859
Nybass...

18:48.760 --> 18:51.963
I believe you know why I'm here.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.568
It is time.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.171
You must begin the sacrament.

19:00.173 --> 19:04.041
The crossover has already begun.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.314
Beware, Father.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.117
Before the souls are gathered,

19:13.119 --> 19:17.155
you will breathe your last breath.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.099
What the hell was that, back there?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.668
You guys just keep that thing
locked up underneath the church?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.537
What's with the whole
dead animal/hand puncture...

19:32.539 --> 19:35.940
I realize you must have
a lot of questions.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.441
Questions are for
history lessons.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.310
All I need to know
is the next flight back home,

19:39.312 --> 19:40.845
because apparently
there's something going on here

19:40.847 --> 19:42.180
that I don't want to be a part of.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.715
Can you think of someone
other than yourself

19:44.717 --> 19:45.950
for a change?

19:46.718 --> 19:48.519
There is a lot more going on here

19:48.521 --> 19:50.488
than you can
begin to grasp, Jason.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.790
There is a war coming,

19:52.792 --> 19:54.692
and we don't have
that much time.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.328
What do you mean?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.664
I need to begin the sacrament.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.299
So for the moment,

20:01.301 --> 20:04.502
try and learn as much as you can
from Laurel, our gatekeeper.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.738
She's responsible for recording
and organizing all of our actions,

20:07.740 --> 20:09.674
past and present.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.845
Remain focused.
There is much to do.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.520
The Apostles were more than philosophers.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.890
The clergy, during the holy war,

20:25.892 --> 20:28.593
had to be well equipped
in order to deal with

20:28.595 --> 20:31.796
extreme cases
of demonic possession.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.501
You have to remember

20:37.503 --> 20:39.570
that back in those days,

20:39.572 --> 20:44.408
any unexplainable event
was met with a religious explanation.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.016
Are you paying attention, Mr. Pafford?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.451
Okay, wow.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.752
You used my government name.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.656
So, yeah...
Clergy, holy war, demons...

21:00.192 --> 21:03.461
So did you know they have an amphibious
double-inhabited thingy,

21:03.463 --> 21:05.463
girl, underneath the church?

21:07.132 --> 21:09.567
Is everything
just a game to you?

21:12.471 --> 21:16.707
For the past few days,
we've had over 100 requests

21:16.709 --> 21:19.510
for paranormal assistance, alone.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.547
Why do you think that is?

21:23.549 --> 21:26.350
Uh, people are all crazy as hell?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.787
Look, listen...

21:29.789 --> 21:31.155
This is all new to me, okay?

21:31.157 --> 21:36.060
Just a few hours ago, I was watching
the man I hate most in this world

21:36.062 --> 21:38.195
get off for killing my family.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.898
Please, just...

21:45.337 --> 21:48.005
I'm sorry about your family.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.174
No, it's fine.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.012
So what do I need to know?

21:58.950 --> 22:01.152
Kasdeya,

22:01.154 --> 22:04.655
the fifth Satan, according to
the Book of Enoch,

22:04.657 --> 22:07.124
which is found
in the over 14 books

22:07.126 --> 22:10.328
of the Apocrypha, and omitted from
the final version

22:10.330 --> 22:11.896
you've come to know.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.966
Kasdeya appears
in human form,

22:15.968 --> 22:18.936
as the gateway key to pave the way
for the arrival

22:18.938 --> 22:20.771
of Beelzebub himself.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.108
According to the records,

22:24.110 --> 22:28.012
he was once responsible
for tempting men

22:28.014 --> 22:31.615
into turning their backs
against God,

22:31.617 --> 22:34.618
and then bringing them forward
for judgement.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.823
The Cloth's main objective
is to seek and destroy

22:38.825 --> 22:42.693
those that would do harm
to the balance of good and evil

22:42.695 --> 22:44.395
from within...

22:44.397 --> 22:50.201
... the only place a battle can
truly be waged amongst men.

22:50.203 --> 22:53.037
Nybass provides us
with the locations

22:53.039 --> 22:55.373
of all paranormal insights
and demon leaders

22:55.375 --> 22:57.375
that may have entered
our realm.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.078
Before her, we relied upon
word of mouth,

23:01.080 --> 23:04.148
and it limited our effectiveness.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.485
Her insights guide us
from location to location

23:07.487 --> 23:09.487
as we attempt to enforce the pact.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.023
Once a person
has become possessed,

23:13.025 --> 23:16.761
their soul no longer exists
in this realm.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.904
Once Kasdeya arrives,

23:26.906 --> 23:31.542
he has seven days before
he must return to his realm.

23:31.544 --> 23:37.481
It is very important that he doesn't take
any lost souls with him.

23:42.354 --> 23:45.189
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

23:46.591 --> 23:48.058
Be open.

23:49.227 --> 23:53.197
Credis in jesum christum filium
<i>eju unicum,</i>

23:53.199 --> 23:56.367
<i>dominum nostrum,</i>
<i>natum et pasum?</i>

23:56.369 --> 23:57.868
I believe.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.904
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

24:04.142 --> 24:06.577
Where do we stand on the boy, Father?

24:08.313 --> 24:11.148
Father Tollman,
I have come to ask you

24:11.150 --> 24:13.284
for permission to begin the sacrament.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.986
The sacrament takes years
of dedication and devotion.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.557
It's not something
to be expedited.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.459
Your concerns are noted.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.662
Father Diekmen,

24:24.664 --> 24:27.331
are you certain he is the one?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.400
We have other worthy candidates...

24:30.802 --> 24:33.337
... all of whom are strong in the faith.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.475
I understand your reluctance,

24:37.477 --> 24:40.578
but I knew his father,
and he believed in me.

24:40.580 --> 24:44.315
And I see the same devotion,
deep down inside of him.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.184
He's survived this long
without our help.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.420
Imagine if he realizes
his full potential.

24:49.422 --> 24:50.488
Hm.

24:50.490 --> 24:55.793
There have been an increase
in activity over the past few days.

24:55.795 --> 24:59.196
We have reason to believe
Kasdeya has arrived.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.998
Then we don't have much time.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.034
Stopping Kasdeya
is our top priority.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.605
You only have seven days.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.572
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

25:09.107 --> 25:10.374
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

25:12.511 --> 25:16.413
So, basically you're using a
form of prayer to keep Nybass contained.

25:17.983 --> 25:23.153
Nybass is very imperative
to the operation.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.422
To gain that much insight...

25:26.858 --> 25:30.861
... has enhance our understanding
into the demonic realm.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.736
You ever get away from this place?

25:47.546 --> 25:51.382
My beliefs come before
my own personal desires.

25:52.584 --> 25:53.751
In short...

25:56.821 --> 25:59.123
... I'm here for God.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.259
That explains it.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.663
What, exactly?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.499
Why you're so uptight.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.239
You gotta get out, live a little.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.142
All this demonic talk
could drive a person crazy, you know?

26:19.744 --> 26:22.179
Look, I say we grab a drink later..

26:22.181 --> 26:23.747
Mr. Pafford...

26:24.916 --> 26:28.919
We are all here on our own
personal journey.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.123
But more importantly,

26:33.125 --> 26:38.596
we are here for something
bigger than our own ideals.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.398
Then you're more of a prisoner

26:41.400 --> 26:42.466
than Nybass will ever be.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.235
What's the point in all this
'saving the world' talk

26:45.237 --> 26:47.271
if you can't even feel alive in it?

26:49.074 --> 26:51.642
Everyone dies, Laurel.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.045
Not everyone lives.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.052
Jason.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.493
It is time.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.001
What is it?

27:18.169 --> 27:20.738
This belonged to your father.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.481
It's time you met Helix.

27:49.402 --> 27:54.271
Looks like you need to take those things
back to the drawing board.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.573
The power of God is strong,
my friend.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.750
Very strong.

28:10.288 --> 28:12.690
I call this one
"The Judge."

28:13.625 --> 28:15.959
Helix is our weapons specialist.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.729
And quality control
for the communion wine.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.366
You must be Jason.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.805
Helix, we don't have much time.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.973
The sacrament has already begun.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.975
What, this early?

28:34.179 --> 28:37.281
But... he doesn't look
like he could take Laurel in a fight.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.651
No offense.

28:43.755 --> 28:45.556
Why wasn't I told?

28:45.558 --> 28:47.491
How come I'm always
the last one to know

28:47.493 --> 28:50.828
about anything
that goes on around here?

28:50.830 --> 28:52.730
Nice robe, by the way, Laurel.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.431
It looks fantastic.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.800
You need to give him a crash course.

29:01.172 --> 29:02.639
Crash course.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.242
Hm.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.643
Okay.

29:06.945 --> 29:10.013
Somebody slap me
with the devil's nut sack.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.051
You think I can just sum up
everything there is to know

29:14.053 --> 29:16.987
about what we do here
in a couple of hours?

29:18.223 --> 29:19.957
Yes.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.764
I'll see what I can do.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.202
Your armor...

29:32.204 --> 29:35.105
... is said to have been blessed
by the Seven Archangels,

29:35.107 --> 29:37.608
and passed down
to Pope Saint Gregory the First.

29:37.610 --> 29:41.044
It's essential in dealing
with otherworldly figures.

29:41.046 --> 29:43.914
All the metal we use
in our weaponry and armor

29:43.916 --> 29:47.284
was found inside
the Ark of the Covenant.

29:48.953 --> 29:52.456
You still talking about
this Friar Tuck outfit?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.634
The bullets burst into projectile form.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.303
And the combustion chamber
consists of holy water

30:06.305 --> 30:08.305
and a fusion liquid
that's been manufactured

30:08.307 --> 30:10.507
beneath the church,

30:10.509 --> 30:12.276
which is why we're located here.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.177
Isn't it, Dieks?

30:13.179 --> 30:16.480
Why else am I never allowed out of this...

30:16.482 --> 30:18.816
... urban paradise?

30:19.851 --> 30:22.519
Your armor doesn't allow
for friendly fire,

30:22.521 --> 30:25.355
which is lucky, because

30:25.357 --> 30:28.325
Diekmen's a terrible shot.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.832
It's also why you're not
an ashy pile of goo

30:34.834 --> 30:36.834
and how you'll be able
to defend yourself from...

30:36.836 --> 30:38.635
... any attack from a demonic creature

30:38.637 --> 30:40.270
that's dwelling in our realm.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.539
While they might have certain abilities...

30:43.809 --> 30:47.377
... telekinesis, superior strength...

30:47.379 --> 30:48.712
... there are limits.

30:48.714 --> 30:52.182
It's a consequence
of their human counterparts.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.818
Even Kasdeya has weaknesses.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.553
Your job is to find them.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.389
Exploit them.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.461
Gabriel...

31:05.330 --> 31:07.731
...one of my personal favorites,

31:07.733 --> 31:08.866
is used on more...

31:08.868 --> 31:11.134
... ethereal creatures.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.536
The Uriel...

31:12.538 --> 31:14.838
... is effective at close range.

31:23.581 --> 31:26.250
The choice of weapon will depend upon

31:26.252 --> 31:29.586
the level of demon
that possesses your victim.

31:33.524 --> 31:34.591
Uh..

31:34.593 --> 31:37.494
Your bloodline will allow you to wield

31:37.496 --> 31:40.030
certain weapons that we're no longer
able to operate,

31:40.032 --> 31:43.500
due the recent passing of...
your....

31:45.169 --> 31:46.403
Um.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.611
Yeah, well...

31:56.247 --> 31:59.416
Holy water and crosses
are still the essential tools.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.751
Let's not forget the basics.

32:00.753 --> 32:01.952
Wouldn't dream of it.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.353
But, never forget...

32:03.355 --> 32:06.957
... ye who wields the mightiest weapon.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.139
Those little babies are called holy grenades.

32:26.711 --> 32:27.911
Yeah...

32:27.913 --> 32:29.446
Well...

32:29.448 --> 32:31.748
... holy water explodes on impact, so...

32:31.750 --> 32:33.684
... be careful with those.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.587
Got a lot of other weapons that...

32:37.589 --> 32:40.590
Well, they're not
what you'd call functional.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.225
But they are street ready.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.662
Unfortunately, Dick-men...

32:47.966 --> 32:50.500
... won't let me show them to you.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.003
Helix...

32:53.805 --> 32:56.873
... you're meant to aid our members...

32:58.242 --> 32:59.910
... not injure them.

33:01.012 --> 33:02.346
I'm afraid she's right.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.780
We need to stick to the basics.

33:05.116 --> 33:07.884
- I'll just take that bad boy right there...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.388
That's not for you.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.426
Then what do I get?

33:18.796 --> 33:20.364
Here you go.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.070
What am I supposed to do with this?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.574
You'll figure it out.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.212
If I pull this out on a demon,

33:35.214 --> 33:38.015
he's gonna think
I'm disrespecting him.

33:38.017 --> 33:41.118
This damn little thing
is gonna break in my pocket.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.537
Roxy.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.472
Hmm.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.342
What are you doing
out there by yourself?

34:05.344 --> 34:07.944
I'm waiting for you.

34:37.608 --> 34:39.208
Mmm.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.311
You want some goodies?

36:09.767 --> 36:13.970
Mmm, it's getting really hot
in here.

36:54.178 --> 36:56.646
Something isn't right here.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.243
Fear not,

38:33.245 --> 38:35.779
for the wrath of God is merciful...

38:35.781 --> 38:36.946
Tell me your name.

38:36.948 --> 38:40.750
... but the wrath of sin is vengeful.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.485
Vengeance is God's.

38:42.487 --> 38:45.789
Kasdeya has come
for your souls.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.925
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde,</i>

38:48.927 --> 38:51.094
<i>in nomine dei patris omnipotentis...</i>

38:53.965 --> 38:55.999
You okay?

39:06.177 --> 39:07.944
Jason, go!

39:28.065 --> 39:29.366
Next time, can I have more than a cross

39:29.368 --> 39:33.036
before you send me into a gunfight?

39:33.038 --> 39:36.072
Well, you needed to learn something.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.216
There's gotta be something missing.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.152
Corinthians...

39:53.591 --> 39:55.992
Letters to Paul...

39:57.328 --> 39:59.929
At the dawn of every era, man must prove

39:59.931 --> 40:02.031
it is worthy of God's forgiveness.

40:02.033 --> 40:05.935
Beelzebub will need a half-breed sacrifice

40:05.937 --> 40:08.938
in order to remain, permanently.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.614
I am the way.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.949
You are the way.

40:23.621 --> 40:25.188
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.189
That's fine.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.659
I see you're reading
the Book of Sage.

40:32.363 --> 40:37.100
You know, you're as beautiful
as the day you were brought to us.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.636
If there's ever anything
that I can do for you,

40:39.638 --> 40:41.204
or that we can talk about,

40:41.206 --> 40:43.973
please, please don't hesitate.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.775
I need to speak to Father Diekmen,

40:45.777 --> 40:48.278
- so, if you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.782
Laurel...

40:55.152 --> 40:58.221
Please do give the good Father
and his new prodigy

40:58.223 --> 41:00.056
all my best.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.999
Vanity's a sin.
You do know that?

41:10.001 --> 41:12.502
What isn't a sin, Diekmen?

41:12.504 --> 41:14.904
I'm just making sure I look good.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.341
What's that?

41:19.743 --> 41:21.778
This isn't making any sense.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.080
I've been telling you that
since the beginning, Dieks.

41:24.082 --> 41:29.085
According to the scrolls,
Kasdeya isn't the only gatekeeper.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.620
What does that mean?

41:30.622 --> 41:32.155
It means that...

41:32.157 --> 41:34.324
There's something else at play here.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.327
I think we're here.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.834
Hey.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.136
Aren't you forgetting something?

41:47.138 --> 41:49.539
Come on,
I still don't have a weapon.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.640
Oh...

41:50.642 --> 41:51.574
Right.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.943
Here you go.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.613
Hey...

41:56.615 --> 41:58.081
Why is yours bigger?

42:07.191 --> 42:08.458
Don't move.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.394
Lewis...

42:11.996 --> 42:13.296
Yeah.

42:13.998 --> 42:16.266
And who the hell are you?

42:17.134 --> 42:19.068
I'm Father Diekmen.

42:19.970 --> 42:22.405
And this is my associate.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.976
I believe you know why we are here.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.116
You can't have her.

42:36.987 --> 42:39.856
Lewis, I don't have to tell you,

42:39.858 --> 42:42.158
if you don't let us do our job,

42:42.160 --> 42:43.226
the consequences...

42:43.228 --> 42:45.562
The hell with your consequences!

42:48.265 --> 42:50.166
That's my daughter.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.950
Diekmen.

44:15.285 --> 44:16.786
<i>Vade in pace,</i>

44:16.788 --> 44:18.921
<i>et dominus sit tecum.</i>

44:20.458 --> 44:22.125
<i>Vade in pace,</i>

44:22.127 --> 44:23.493
<i>et dominus sit tecum.</i>

44:25.430 --> 44:26.763
Why are you here?

44:31.969 --> 44:34.037
Where is Kasdeya?

44:39.643 --> 44:41.344
Speak some more shit!

44:42.112 --> 44:45.348
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde...</i>

44:46.484 --> 44:47.884
<i>... in nomine dei patris</i>

44:47.886 --> 44:48.785
<i>omnipotentis...</i>

44:48.787 --> 44:54.023
<i>... et in noimine jesu christi filii ejus...</i>

44:58.162 --> 45:00.296
I am done.

45:02.499 --> 45:05.768
Well, that must have been
an awkward car ride home.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.639
Don't let it get to you, Jason.

45:09.641 --> 45:12.575
There's a lot more
we need to accomplish.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.144
What's going on?

45:15.146 --> 45:16.746
What's going on is,
I spent the last few days

45:16.748 --> 45:20.750
getting thrown into walls
and spit on by the devil's minions.

45:20.752 --> 45:23.886
What's going on is,
I don't belong here.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.722
This is what your father wanted,

45:25.724 --> 45:27.223
I know.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.958
Well, he's not here, is he?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.061
Did I miss something?

45:33.230 --> 45:37.366
Your father believed in something
a lot bigger than himself.

45:37.368 --> 45:40.803
He did everything he could
to protect you and his family.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.007
If we don't stop Kasdeya now,

45:45.009 --> 45:47.944
everything he fought for will be lost.

45:51.381 --> 45:55.918
And I have found an interesting wrinkle
in the prophecy.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.086
Good luck with that.

46:04.561 --> 46:09.065
Okay, could somebody
tell me what just happened?

46:09.067 --> 46:11.801
Who throws Jesus
on a table like that?

46:11.803 --> 46:12.935
Come on!

46:18.408 --> 46:19.342
Father...

46:20.110 --> 46:21.477
Rosa.

46:22.546 --> 46:23.880
We will pray for your family,

46:23.882 --> 46:25.314
but our hands are tied
at the moment.

46:25.316 --> 46:26.582
Is there anything you can do?

46:26.584 --> 46:29.452
You promised that if I paid,
someone would come.

46:30.721 --> 46:33.823
You gotta understand how small
your contribution was.

46:35.092 --> 46:37.760
Look, I'll talk to Father Tollman,
see what...

46:37.762 --> 46:38.494
... if, something can be done.

46:38.496 --> 46:41.731
- Oh, Father, please.
- I've gotta get to confession.

46:41.733 --> 46:42.899
I gotta go to confession.

46:42.901 --> 46:43.966
No, Father...

46:56.013 --> 46:57.814
Forgive me, Father...

46:58.849 --> 47:00.516
I have sinned.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.586
Well the Lord
is ready to forgive you,

47:03.588 --> 47:04.854
if you are seeking forgiveness.

47:04.856 --> 47:07.156
But you must be willing to change.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.359
I fear that I can't, Father.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.696
I fear that I won't stop...

47:15.699 --> 47:18.701
... until I have eliminated The Cloth.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.238
Kasdeya...

47:25.209 --> 47:27.176
This is a violation of the pact.

47:30.515 --> 47:33.282
They say it's the root of all evil.

47:35.286 --> 47:38.387
I hope he is more merciful...

47:39.223 --> 47:40.456
...than I am.

48:00.377 --> 48:02.478
Come on, Julia.

48:03.747 --> 48:06.682
Doesn't anyone take "no" for an answer?

48:12.656 --> 48:13.923
Julia, sweetie,

48:13.925 --> 48:16.225
I know I said to let yourself in, but

48:16.227 --> 48:18.327
this is a bit much.

48:32.109 --> 48:34.610
You know, I don't really know
how to say this, but

48:34.612 --> 48:37.346
I don't really see us
working out, you know?

48:38.448 --> 48:41.751
I mean, you're a nice girl
and all, but...

48:41.753 --> 48:44.287
I'm just not looking
for anything serious.

49:04.908 --> 49:10.012
I... will show you...
his true nature.

49:11.982 --> 49:15.885
Do you think you know what it means
to serve him?

49:17.955 --> 49:24.527
I will show you the true desires
of a man.

49:29.933 --> 49:32.702
The darkness will consume you!

49:37.941 --> 49:39.809
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

49:44.681 --> 49:48.351
Mortal, you have nothing
that can harm me.

49:55.092 --> 49:57.426
Consider it your last.

50:01.298 --> 50:03.666
Prepare to meet your master.

50:12.276 --> 50:13.676
That's holy water.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.580
Bitch.

50:38.068 --> 50:39.535
Laurel.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.070
Hi.

50:42.005 --> 50:44.974
I got your address
from Father Diekmen's log.

50:46.209 --> 50:48.477
In regular clothes, no less.

50:48.479 --> 50:50.913
I mean,
I didn't know you could.

50:52.049 --> 50:55.584
Well, I'm a historian, not a nun.

50:55.586 --> 50:58.921
I'm free to dress accordingly
to occasion.

50:58.923 --> 51:01.457
Well, you look human,
so that's a good thing.

51:02.692 --> 51:04.126
Thank you.

51:05.262 --> 51:07.163
What's that smell?

51:07.165 --> 51:09.665
- It smells like sulfur.
- Come on in.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.538
What happened here?

51:15.540 --> 51:20.509
I had an ex-girlfriend drop by,
and we had a little confrontation.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.578
I wanted drapes,
she wanted blinds,

51:22.580 --> 51:25.514
but I think she really just wanted
my soul.

51:25.516 --> 51:28.517
Must be some soul.

51:30.220 --> 51:31.554
Trouble's been following me
my whole life,

51:31.556 --> 51:34.290
I don't really expect relationships
to be any different.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.360
Do you want a drink?

51:39.096 --> 51:41.363
Did your girlfriend
write these?

51:41.365 --> 51:42.765
Ex!

51:42.767 --> 51:45.468
I told you, I like to keep my options open

51:47.304 --> 51:49.738
There are more layers

51:49.740 --> 51:51.707
to the context of man...

51:52.642 --> 51:56.445
And so are there to the context of evil.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.547
I am the way.

51:58.549 --> 52:00.149
You are the way.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.052
I mean, I saw
these same exact markings

52:03.054 --> 52:05.221
from my readings from earlier.

52:07.224 --> 52:08.557
What do you mean?

52:09.292 --> 52:11.460
It means...

52:11.462 --> 52:15.931
... that Kasdeya is only one piece...

52:15.933 --> 52:17.399
... of the puzzle.

52:18.235 --> 52:19.635
It means that...

52:20.303 --> 52:22.438
... Beelzebub...

52:22.440 --> 52:25.908
... isn't just trying to walk amongst us.

52:28.011 --> 52:30.546
He's trying to bring his hell with him.

52:33.950 --> 52:35.451
So I just started
doing everything I could

52:35.453 --> 52:38.721
to dispel any rumor
I was my father's son, you know?

52:40.423 --> 52:44.026
It seems like he wanted
what was best for you.

52:44.028 --> 52:45.094
Yeah, well...

52:45.096 --> 52:48.664
I think he blamed me
for my mother's death in child birth.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.201
Somehow feeding me all that religious B.S.

52:52.203 --> 52:54.537
was just a way to atone for that guilt.

52:54.539 --> 52:56.205
That's what I believe.

52:59.543 --> 53:02.111
Tell me about the accident.

53:05.982 --> 53:09.718
I'd just done a stint in juvie
when my old man picked me up.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.354
It was rainy, and the roads were slick.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.689
I remember saying so to my dad,

53:13.691 --> 53:15.991
who was preaching to me
about how God had provided me

53:15.993 --> 53:18.060
all the tools I needed,

53:18.062 --> 53:21.397
and I needed to stop wasting my gifts.

53:21.399 --> 53:25.734
Eddie had just lost his job
and then his kids in a divorce.

53:25.736 --> 53:27.469
He decided to go out drinking.

53:27.471 --> 53:28.837
One thing led to another.

53:28.839 --> 53:30.673
He lost control of his wheel, and...

53:39.849 --> 53:42.785
People were yelling
at the sight of all the blood.

53:44.321 --> 53:45.654
I remember looking up,

53:45.656 --> 53:47.423
and seeing everything
burning up around me;

53:47.425 --> 53:49.191
all the chaos.

53:49.193 --> 53:51.727
I looked over at my dad.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.629
He wasn't afraid at all.

53:58.401 --> 53:59.335
Here it was, you know?

53:59.337 --> 54:01.237
That moment people talk about.

54:01.239 --> 54:04.073
What would you say if you had
to make amends for a failed relationship?

54:04.075 --> 54:06.242
What would you say with your last breath?

54:06.244 --> 54:08.877
Like, this was our moment.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.980
You wanna know what he said to me?

54:12.616 --> 54:15.251
He looked me straight in the eye
and said,

54:15.253 --> 54:18.520
"Be open."
That's it.

54:21.291 --> 54:23.225
I can't begin to understand

54:23.227 --> 54:26.228
your relationship with your father.

54:26.230 --> 54:28.130
But I do know

54:28.132 --> 54:30.199
that he devoted his life

54:30.201 --> 54:32.601
to our cause.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.069
Lot of good his work did.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.171
World's gonna end, anyway.

54:37.574 --> 54:39.908
Everyone dies, Jason,

54:39.910 --> 54:42.978
but not everyone lives.

54:44.314 --> 54:47.383
Look, Father Diekmen needs you.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.452
Father Dean was attacked

54:50.454 --> 54:53.055
by Kasdeya in his church up north.

54:53.057 --> 54:55.491
- How's that possible?
- I don't know.

54:55.493 --> 54:59.995
But I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone
is playing by the rules.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.398
Father Dean was rumored to be taking bribes

55:02.400 --> 55:07.169
in exchange for assistance
in dealing with the paranormal.

55:07.171 --> 55:09.405
Corruption in the church?
Go figure.

55:09.407 --> 55:12.908
There's no such thing
as corruption in the church, Jason.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.612
The only church that has ever existed

55:16.614 --> 55:18.347
lies within.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.417
Father Dean was found

55:21.419 --> 55:23.519
with over 3,000 coins...

55:24.621 --> 55:29.158
... lodged in his digestive system
and main arteries.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.728
Sounds like maybe
Kasdeya's not such a bad guy after all.

55:35.031 --> 55:37.599
Hell is coming to Earth.

55:37.601 --> 55:41.437
And you're too busy
living in your own to even notice.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.971
I don't even know why I thought

55:42.973 --> 55:45.774
that coming here
would make a difference.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.449
And you can't forgive Eddie

55:53.451 --> 55:55.317
because deep down,

55:55.319 --> 55:58.554
you were the one driving that truck.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.125
I thought you needed my help.

56:03.127 --> 56:05.060
We'll do it without you.

56:05.729 --> 56:08.364
What happened to being open?

56:41.064 --> 56:43.332
232 South Pike Boulevard.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.070
Eddie?

56:53.576 --> 56:55.010
Eddie?

56:56.012 --> 56:58.614
Look, I don't mean to intrude,
the door was open.

56:59.849 --> 57:01.617
Well, I just wanted to come down here
and tell you

57:01.619 --> 57:03.685
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what happened.

57:03.687 --> 57:05.621
And, you know, I went down
to the courthouse

57:05.623 --> 57:08.457
and got your address, so I just wanted
to tell you officially that...

57:10.294 --> 57:12.194
Eddie?

57:15.031 --> 57:17.332
Oh, you gotta be shitting me!

57:20.537 --> 57:22.571
How was the house call?

57:22.573 --> 57:24.106
It was hell.

57:24.108 --> 57:26.542
Where do we stand?

57:29.279 --> 57:31.313
We have Kasdeya's location.

57:31.315 --> 57:34.383
He's being held up in a spot
called Dante's.

57:34.385 --> 57:36.819
And that's not the best part.

57:36.821 --> 57:39.321
Apparently tonight is a special night.

57:39.323 --> 57:41.557
And not just because
ladies get in for free,

57:41.559 --> 57:44.326
but because...
it's the last day.

57:45.562 --> 57:47.663
If he's in a stationary position like this,

57:47.665 --> 57:49.998
we believe he may have
all the souls he needs

57:50.000 --> 57:52.801
to have Beelzebub pass over.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.736
Which means
it's up to us to stop him.

57:54.738 --> 57:56.972
Gear's on the table.

58:00.276 --> 58:03.612
Your father had the same look
of determination.

58:03.614 --> 58:05.647
The same fire.

58:08.818 --> 58:11.587
I remember the last time
I saw his face.

58:13.022 --> 58:16.158
He was holding a possessed girl
in his clutches,

58:16.160 --> 58:19.461
not wanting to turn her over
to the order.

58:19.463 --> 58:21.930
Why didn't he want to give her up?

58:21.932 --> 58:25.501
Your father had the ability
to see the good in everyone.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.536
And on that day...

58:29.439 --> 58:32.508
... he saw the good in Laurel.

58:35.044 --> 58:40.215
Father Tollman had never seen
anyone recover from such a strong possession,

58:40.217 --> 58:43.619
and he deemed it necessary
to terminate the child.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.322
But your father felt otherwise.

58:47.324 --> 58:50.659
As I lay there in his arms,

58:50.661 --> 58:54.029
my mind and soul being torn

58:54.031 --> 58:57.833
into two separate identities,

58:57.835 --> 58:59.902
he looked at me and said,

58:59.904 --> 59:03.171
the battle between good and evil

59:03.173 --> 59:07.643
will be won in the only place
it has ever been waged...

59:09.412 --> 59:10.646
... from within.

59:14.384 --> 59:18.086
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

59:20.757 --> 59:22.491
Be open.

59:25.094 --> 59:27.396
As much as I hate to be the one
to break up this...

59:27.398 --> 59:29.064
... tender moment,

59:29.066 --> 59:31.066
you've got until
the stroke of midnight,

59:31.068 --> 59:33.602
or the crossover begins.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.671
Weapon up, Jason.

59:38.775 --> 59:40.309
Right.

59:42.011 --> 59:47.082
As much as I appreciate your dedication to
the smaller things...

59:47.084 --> 59:51.186
I believe a little more of the good Lord's grace
is in order.

59:53.623 --> 59:55.524
Amen, Father.

59:55.526 --> 59:57.192
Amen!

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.097
Give 'em hell.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.677
It's gonna be alright.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.346
Just keep some pressure on it.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.884
Be open, Jason.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:49.057
She's more important
than you know.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:54.563
- No...
- You must protect her.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.939
You are the way.

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:22.023
Valiant and noble effort, human.

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:27.662
You'd do well in my legion.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:31.032
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde,</i>

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.567
<i>in nomine dei patris omnipotentis</i>

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.704
<i>et in noimine jesu christi filii ejus,</i>
<i>domini et judicis nostri,</i>

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:39.040
<i>et in virtute spiritus ut</i>
<i>discedas ab hoc pasmate Dei!</i>

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.576
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.211
Thought I'd give it a shot.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.051
I really must thank you.

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.421
Jason.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:57.259
You had no clue what this was all about.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:05:00.762
And yet, here you are,

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:05.834
providing us with the very thing
we needed all along.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.505
Be open, Jason.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:13.375
Eventually we will get to you.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.377
Just like we did Eddie.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:18.914
Not once, but twice.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:21.082
And I can't wait to taste

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:25.420
that sweet, sweet Laurel.

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.632
She...

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:40.869
... is the key.

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:49.110
You left her in the hands of one of us.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.447
How's it feel knowing that
everyone you love

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:56.318
will soon be serving
my master on Earth?

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.053
Or, should I say...

01:05:58.055 --> 01:05:59.888
... in Hell?

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:11.933
<i>Ego te baptizo in nomine patris</i>
<i>et filii et spiritus sancti.</i>

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:13.935
You...

01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:14.769
... will...

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.304
... fail!

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.087
Nybass?

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:40.862
I need to ask you a question.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:54.943
Laurel.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:59.581
How did I break free from your spell?

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:04.319
You have one of your own
to thank for that.

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:06.888
<i>Tu autem effugare, diabole...</i>

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:09.357
<i>... tu autem...</i>

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.160
Save your useless prayer.

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:18.867
For years you let me rot in this prison.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:25.807
You knew it was you I wanted all along.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:28.143
You are the way.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:33.348
With you, we shall be free
to rule this realm.

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:46.061
Where's Father Diekmen?

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.000
Oh.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.573
I see.

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.112
We got there and they hit us hard.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:07.015
There should have been more of us.

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:13.154
Where's Laurel?

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.657
Helix?

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.028
She's been taken.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.130
By who?

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.033
Nybass.

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:34.908
Nybass is planning
on completing the crossover.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:38.313
And she's gonna use Laurel
as the final gateway.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.814
We killed Kasdeya,
how is that possible?

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:44.319
Kasdeya was just a distraction.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.331
You gave Laurel up to be sacrificed.

01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:01.870
God don't like ugly.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.478
Do you wanna tell me what's going on?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.845
Yeah, Father Tollman gave Laurel up

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.415
for the emergence of the dark Lord.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.620
Is this thing ready?

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.854
It's as ready as it's gonna get.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.090
I need these.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:27.495
Okay, I don't think you're in the right state
of thinking, right now.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.966
You're going up against Nybass.

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:36.171
Not only that, you're going
behind enemy lines.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.207
The crossover has begun
as we speak.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:42.477
Yeah, well, I always wanted
to expand my spiritual horizons.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.444
But you don't even know where she is.

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:47.448
- I'll figure it out.
- Wait.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.050
Just a second...

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:55.123
You don't really understand
what you're going up against.

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:57.358
I really think we need to plan.

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.394
Okay.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.996
Okay?

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:04.299
Yeah, okay.
We need a plan.

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:07.468
Good, 'cause, or a second there,

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:10.572
I thought you were going
to do something really...

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.186
Hello, Eddie.

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:29.090
Soon Beelzebub will be upon you.

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:30.491
Maybe.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.827
Not until you tell me
what I want to know.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.729
I'll tell you nothing.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:41.202
I'm gonna ask this, one time nice,
and one time naughty.

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:43.404
Where will they make the sacrifice?

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:54.582
What do you know?
Somebody put holy water in my gun.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.084
Where did they take her?

01:10:56.086 --> 01:11:00.622
They took her back to where it all began.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.857
But you're too late.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.095
I got some good news.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:08.963
I'm not gonna kill ya.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.498
Hold on to this for me, will ya?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.642
Do you think this is the life
he would have wanted for you?

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.053
At some point, Jason,

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:35.156
you are gonna have to
take control of your life.

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:38.159
It's what your father
would have wanted.

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.052
This isn't the lab.

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:11.659
Though not quite as much as when you dragged me
up to the roof of the church.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.994
I...

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.529
Oh, for Heaven's sake.

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:36.177
Lord, show me the way.

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:44.619
That didn't work.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:58.733
There are more layers to the context of men,

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:02.136
and so must there be
to the context of good and evil.

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:04.639
I am the way, you are the way.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.362
Father...

01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:35.229
Help me.

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.735
How'd you get down here?

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:42.470
I serve the church.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:49.310
It was only a matter of time
before I found out about this place.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:54.215
The crossover, it's complete.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.584
Are there any others?

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.653
The new trainees and the recruits

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:00.855
started disappearing this morning.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.890
So I came down and investigate,

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:05.059
and I was attacked.

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.496
We have to keep moving forward.

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:16.904
This is where the pact was formed.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:27.648
The Cloth's been working above this
the whole time?

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.285
Yes, this is our beginning.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:35.356
The first true church formed underground
during the time of our exile.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:39.093
It was the only time where you could
practice your faith.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.197
This is the place where they planned to
make people believe

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.665
in the church again.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.639
Laurel!

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:58.145
Laurel, it's Jason.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.555
Father, I could use some help in here.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:15.062
Did you miss me, my love?

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.243
Oof!

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:39.820
Soon...

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:43.591
... my master...

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:48.929
... will inhabit this Earth...

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:51.198
... and claim the rest...

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.000
... of your weak...

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:57.038
... pathetic souls.

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:03.878
<i>Excorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde,</i>

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.814
<i>in nomine dei patris omnipotentis...</i>

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:30.604
For years, I've waited for this moment.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:36.110
I will have my vengeance.

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.246
Let Laurel go.

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:48.923
Your pretty little girlfriend...

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:52.660
... is in good hands.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.807
It is time.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.872
Jason, we're running out of time!

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.279
Come in to me.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:49.884
<i>In oderem suavitatis,</i>
<i>tu autem effugare, diabole.</i>

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:51.919
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:54.555
I am the way, you are the way.

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.260
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde,</i>

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:03.998
<i>et in noimine jesu christi filii ejus,</i>
<i>domini et judicis nostri</i>

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.701
<i>et in virtute spiritus ut</i>
<i>disedas ab hoc plasmate Dei!</i>

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:26.487
Your soul...

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:27.688
... shall be mine.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.663
Now you'll serve the one true master.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.174
Is the best you can do?

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.211
Hey, asshole.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:54.348
Be open.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.425
Are you okay?

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.097
Is it over?

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:13.701
I think so.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.915
Sorry, this one's...

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:29.850
... not quite...

01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:31.585
... street ready.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.589
You know you missed everything, right?

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.993
We coulda used a plan.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:41.362
Oh, that's really funny.

01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:44.031
Just watch your back, that's all I'm saying.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.500
Your gauntlets sucked, by the way.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:50.771
You just never had a big boy weapon before,
that's your problem.

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:52.373
Button in the palm.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.108
You gotta make an "X"

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:56.443
Chicks dig the "X", man.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:59.713
Chicks?
Bro, you gotta get out more.

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:01.181
I don't think it worked for Laurel.

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:03.751
It's a symbol for The Cloth,
what are you talking about?

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:05.219
Are you going to do this all night?

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:06.587
Yes!

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.557
You did, though, didn't you?

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:12.693
You made the "X" when you did it, yeah?

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:17.031
Yeah, I made the "X."

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:19.333
That's what I'm talking about.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.642
Good to see you again, old friend.
