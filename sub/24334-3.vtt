WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.708
NARRATOR: You've heard
of the placebo effect.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.111
But are you aware...

00:10.144 --> 00:13.247
of the nocebo effect?

00:13.281 --> 00:16.417
In which the human body has
a negative physical reaction

00:16.450 --> 00:17.851
to a suggested harm.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.321
This will make you vomit.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.526
This will make you vomit.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.200
This will make you vomit.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.701
NARRATOR:
Your mind has the power

00:33.734 --> 00:36.137
to create
its own physical reality.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.205
This will make you vomit.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.826
NARRATOR: Why do we yawn
when we see others yawn?

00:58.859 --> 01:01.195
-NARRATOR: Throughout history,

01:01.229 --> 01:03.397
-there have been incidents.

01:03.431 --> 01:07.168
-The Dancing Plague of 1518...

01:07.201 --> 01:09.503
the Tanganyika
laughter epidemic...

01:11.239 --> 01:13.507
...the Hindu milk miracle.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.775
MAN:
Hey...

01:19.046 --> 01:23.517
Some believe they're
a response to stress.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.094
-She is our daughter!
-She is my daughter!

01:34.128 --> 01:35.596
You didn't have her by yourself!

01:35.629 --> 01:37.131
WOMAN: I don't care anymore,
what you have to say!

01:37.165 --> 01:38.499
I'm done!

01:43.171 --> 01:46.640
NARRATOR: Psychologists call it
a conversion disorder.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.446
In that the body converts
a mental stress...

01:53.947 --> 01:55.749
...to a set
of physical symptoms.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.452
In this case, a tic, or spasm.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.157
And, like any disorder,

02:03.191 --> 02:06.594
it can be contagious.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.297
This kind
of collective behavior

02:09.330 --> 02:10.998
is not limited to human beings.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.105
What we know is that,
in certain communities,

02:18.138 --> 02:21.475
under specific circumstances,

02:21.509 --> 02:25.446
an involuntary physical symptom
developed by one person...

02:26.880 --> 02:28.849
...can become viral.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.287
-NARRATOR: And spread,

02:33.321 --> 02:34.455
from person...

02:36.257 --> 02:37.625
What was that?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.126
...to person...

02:39.159 --> 02:41.128
:
I... I don't know what to do.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.130
Steph, just calm down.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.498
It's gonna go away.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.801
...to person...

02:59.847 --> 03:01.415
How are... how are you?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.817
NARRATOR: ...until the entire
community is infected.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.629
But you don't see
other signs of, uh...

03:15.663 --> 03:19.032
NARRATOR:
And so, my question to you is,

03:19.066 --> 03:21.068
if the idea of illness

03:21.101 --> 03:24.137
can become illness,

03:24.171 --> 03:27.341
what else about our reality

03:27.375 --> 03:30.544
is actually a disorder?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.731

09:01.775 --> 09:02.843
You ready?

09:02.876 --> 09:03.977
Do we have to?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.045
We do.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.682
WOMAN :
New symptom alert.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.384
Irritability.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.623
This is called shaomai.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.159
I-It's a traditional
Chinese dumpling.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.362
There is a Japanese version
which is more shrimp-based,

09:22.395 --> 09:25.599
but I prefer these, so...

09:25.633 --> 09:27.534
Mm.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.436
T-They're fishy.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.105
It's 'cause it has crab meat.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.075
See, all you do--
Kerry-- all you do:

09:35.108 --> 09:37.878
dip it, and take a bite.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.181
-That's it.
-Mm.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.550
Look, I just don't
see the point.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.019
-Kerry...
-You know, I get all
the nutrition I need

09:46.053 --> 09:47.420
-when we're, when we're...
-I know, I know.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.823
-...together, so...
-But we agreed,

09:49.857 --> 09:54.527
after last year, not to take
anything for granted.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.630
We need you to be independent.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.402
-And there's more to life
than fighting, so...
-Okay, okay.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.604
Just one.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.807
-Here. Here, just...
: Well, I just
can't do one.

-Mmm.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.392
-Yeah.
-And that's called cream soda.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.194
More.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.064
-KERRY: This is so disgusting.
-No, it's...

10:31.098 --> 10:32.632
Uh, this is perfectly natural.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.035
The food goes in
and then it has to come out.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.603
Of my butt.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.305
Yeah.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.273
D-Do you want me
to come in and help you?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.242
No, no, I'm, uh...

Disinfection crews

10:51.451 --> 10:52.619

Disinfection crews
will commence at 0630.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.126
DAVID:
Is it weird?

10:59.159 --> 11:02.062
Being a cat?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.663
SYD:
There are certain...

11:05.733 --> 11:07.000
...impulses...

11:08.168 --> 11:10.170
...I have to resist.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.843
What's he look like?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.611
DAVID:
The monk?

11:18.645 --> 11:22.449
He's pale.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.752
Very pale.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.022
Honestly, it was dark
in the club.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.391
I never got that close.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.326
SYD:
When you saw me, in the future,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.295
what was I like?

11:35.328 --> 11:36.964
DAVID:
Hmm, what do you mean?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.132
SYD:
Did I look the same?

11:39.166 --> 11:43.070
-DAVID: Not... quite.
-Hi. Nice kitty.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.206
SYD:
Am I prettier now, or then?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.241
DAVID: I feel like
this is a trick question.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.811
SYD:
Hold on.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.281
Something's happening.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.083

Move.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.885
Move!

12:01.488 --> 12:04.724

I have no idea what's inside.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.408

the inside of the glass.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.411
VERMILLION 1:
Yes.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.148

is wearing off.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.157
Shit.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.579
VERMILLION:
Count confirmed.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.148
One civilian missing.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.916
It's a sealed room.
He couldn't just...

13:04.251 --> 13:06.519
VERMILLION 2:
Secure the building.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.089
-Secure the building.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
Secure the building.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.062
Secure the building.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.236
SYD: Why can't you
just find him yourself,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.238
-DAVID: I tried.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.307
Either he's not here or...

13:27.340 --> 13:30.978
Fukyama said these monks
can control their thoughts.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.246
SYD: Isn't it better
if we can find him first,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.482
see what we can learn
and then tell Farouk?

13:35.515 --> 13:38.318
DAVID: Yeah, probably.
But he owes me some answers.

13:38.351 --> 13:42.222
Hey. What happened to you
back there?

13:42.255 --> 13:45.025
I'm not sure, but I...

13:45.058 --> 13:47.394
I saw a flash, of you...

13:47.427 --> 13:49.796
in the future.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.599
-You were writing me a message.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.667
What did it say?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.337
"H."

14:00.173 --> 14:02.309
Stay here.
Keep an eye on the search.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.443
Be careful.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.178
You too.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.418
Uh, tank 2.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.922
Does that work?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.058
:
Nothing works.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.426
So why...?

14:53.460 --> 14:56.096
Got to try something, right?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.232
I'm-I'm Lenny.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.935
She of the great escape.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.471
Says every girl I ever banged.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.875
Hey, speaking of...

15:08.908 --> 15:11.578
You got any pills

15:11.611 --> 15:13.480
Smoke?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.448
:
Glue?

15:15.482 --> 15:17.550
Where is he?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.919
Hey, how come we never talk?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.288
Come on.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.522
It's me.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.993
Hey, y-you look good.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.695
How's... how's the girlfriend?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.030
Sydney, right?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.132
Syd?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.566
Or the... the old bat

15:33.600 --> 15:35.368
and the... and the black guy.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.670
How's... Is he...

15:37.704 --> 15:39.606
He's looking pretty fit.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.908
Farouk?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.247
Dude...

15:47.280 --> 15:49.616
you got to help me.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.920
I'm dying out here.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.556
I'm...

15:56.589 --> 15:58.992
I'm like a pet.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
Or a house plant.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.934
I pulled out
all my hair... before.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.602
Yesterday.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.241
But it all came back.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.146
Maybe that was a dream, then.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.152
Can you...

16:25.185 --> 16:27.487
talk to him?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.956
Yeah?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.025
El Rey?

16:32.059 --> 16:33.726
The King?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.629
Just...

16:36.663 --> 16:38.998
get me out of here.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.436
Farouk?

16:43.470 --> 16:46.306
:
Please. Please.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.112
Put me out of my misery.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.913
Please.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.551
FAROUK:
You found him.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.487
Our monk.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.629
DAVID:
In with the sick.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.167
There was a handprint
on the glass.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.336
He's loose now,
inside Division 3,

17:16.369 --> 17:19.539
but I can't... His mind...

17:19.572 --> 17:23.476
The Monks of the Mi-Go order.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.313
Impenetrable.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.081
Unless...

17:28.115 --> 17:30.250
you know the secret.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.830
When I find him...

17:43.863 --> 17:46.833
and he tells you
where your body is...

17:46.866 --> 17:49.236
what are you gonna do with it?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.404
Live in it, my dear.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.573
South of France.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.275
Women.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.110
Money.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.845
Power.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.481
And that's it?

18:01.514 --> 18:05.118
No supervillain
"destroy the world" bullshit?

18:06.686 --> 18:09.489
This word-- "villain"--

18:09.522 --> 18:12.359
do you know where it comes from?

18:12.392 --> 18:14.627
C'est francais.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.029
It means, originally,

18:17.063 --> 18:19.031
"one who lives in a village."

18:19.065 --> 18:20.800
A peasant.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.737
Do I seem like a peasant to you?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.707
-You know what I mean.
-No. This is important.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.476
Language.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.511
The meaning of things.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.480
You called me a villain.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.682
Me, the king.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.457
For decades
I rule over my country.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.259
I'm a good king.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.528
Strong, but just.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.298
My people, they prosper.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.100
And then your father...

18:54.133 --> 18:56.936
a white man, which is--

18:56.969 --> 18:59.939
you tell me, important?--

18:59.972 --> 19:01.474
he comes.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.776
Does he speak our language?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.813
Does he know our customs?

19:06.846 --> 19:09.282
And he decides what?

19:09.316 --> 19:12.285
That my people
should have better?

19:12.319 --> 19:15.322
That he knows better?

19:15.355 --> 19:19.058
Who is he to make such choices?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.630
You fed off me
when I was a baby.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.733
And I'm supposed to feel,
what, sorry for you?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.167
Is it such a terrible thing

19:28.201 --> 19:30.903
to feel sorrow for your enemy?

19:30.937 --> 19:34.807
What is he, except a brother
with another name?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.476
We're not brothers.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.351
You are still young.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.654
You think justice
is a glass jar.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.656
You fill it with your hurt,

19:49.689 --> 19:52.425
your hate.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.161
Don't you think
I have my own jar?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.330
I'm a refugee.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.400
Do you know the meaning
of that word?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.269
Refugee.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.904
Driven from my home, in exile.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.507
Prisoner in another man's body.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.342
Nobody put you in my head.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.178
Or Oliver's.
You made a choice.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.513
:
Of course.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.517
If the choice is
between death or life...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.719
I choose life.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.395
Listen, I'll call you when
I have the monk somewhere safe.

20:28.428 --> 20:32.732
He takes us to your body,
and then you are gone.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.535
Gone.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.004
No one ever hears
your name again.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.510
Interesting, don't you think?

20:43.543 --> 20:46.879
You're doing this
for a woman you love

20:46.913 --> 20:50.683
who lives in a future you're
going to destroy if you help me.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.053
-The timeline.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.122
She lives in a future

20:56.155 --> 20:58.891
you are trying to change,
and when you do,

20:58.925 --> 21:01.428
she will cease to exist.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.896
So, really, you are...

21:03.930 --> 21:06.666
helping her to commit suicide.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.769
Oh, and be careful
with the monk.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.904
He is very... ansteckend.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.073
Contagious.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.909
See, this, uh...

21:16.943 --> 21:18.778
madness.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.914
They think it's me,
that I'm infecting people.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.583
But it's him.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.817
He's toxic.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.454
He is like Typhoid Mary.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.489
But where he goes,

21:29.522 --> 21:31.724
I follow.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.226
So your friends think

21:34.260 --> 21:36.629
that I am the Mary.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.134
Not so smart, your friends.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.276
I got to...

21:52.879 --> 21:54.547
Cary?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.985
Hello?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.855
Guys?

22:04.424 --> 22:06.393
*

22:44.130 --> 22:46.132
*

24:22.128 --> 24:24.030
-Ow! Ow!
-Oh! Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.165
-Geez, it's me. Aah.
-Sorry. I-I'm sorry.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.034
Shit! What is that?

24:28.067 --> 24:30.002
-It's just...
-It's so lemony.

24:30.036 --> 24:33.105
-...some household cleaner.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.841
Wh... Where is everybody?

24:34.874 --> 24:36.475
I don't know.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.110
There were... alarms.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.478
I heard guns.

24:39.512 --> 24:40.980
And Kerry went.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.149
But I-I'm...
not physically brave.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.117
-So I...
-Okay, hold on.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.829
:
Syd

24:57.997 --> 24:59.866
Clark?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.337
They're not answering.
We're gonna have to find them.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.907
-I saw him.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.241
The monk.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.877
He had...

25:10.910 --> 25:14.280
the... children, the soldiers
that were following him.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.982
I thought they were immune.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.150
To the disease.
But he was humming a tune

25:18.184 --> 25:20.620
that was very...

25:22.021 --> 25:23.556
...catchy.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.204
Keep your eyes out for a cow.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.674
Cow?

25:45.978 --> 25:47.747
:
Syd?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.551
:
David.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.790
DAVID:
Shit.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.698
He's in there, right?

26:05.732 --> 26:08.167
His mind... somewhere?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.336
Oh, yes. Brain readings
remain normal.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.505
His mind is active, we just
don't know what it's doing.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.343
They're in the maze.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.145
Meaning?

26:19.178 --> 26:23.115
I don't know.
Let's find out.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.872
Now, is this...

26:45.905 --> 26:49.175
Well, we're inside his mind.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.978
Oh. It's nice.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.385
David.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.497
Oh...

27:13.599 --> 27:16.102
Ew.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.977
-Hello.
-Hey, man.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.582
It's David and Cary.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.253
Do you...

27:34.286 --> 27:37.556
Hello.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.025
It-It's David.

27:39.058 --> 27:42.194
We're...

27:42.228 --> 27:44.396
The monk infected you.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.934
We're here to, I guess,

27:47.967 --> 27:50.602
rescue you?

27:50.636 --> 27:52.571
Hello.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.645
DAVID:
What's wrong with him?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.680
I don't know.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.617
Is this where everybody goes?

28:05.651 --> 28:06.919
When they get infected?

28:06.953 --> 28:09.822
Some kind of floral
astral plane?

28:09.856 --> 28:12.358
Do you sense anyone else here?

28:14.593 --> 28:15.594
Nope.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.330
Then...

28:18.364 --> 28:20.032
it's his maze.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.034
If I had to guess,

28:22.068 --> 28:24.336
I'd say the contagion
locks people

28:24.370 --> 28:26.338
inside their own brains.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.141
Inside their own realities.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.878
Yeah, this is Ptonomy's maze.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.546
Yeah, but... gardening?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.651
It isn't gardening.

28:39.685 --> 28:43.489
It's that he doesn't
remember us. See?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.657
He forgets what he's doing
after every rose,

28:45.691 --> 28:48.327
and then the shears and
the basket-- they remind him.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.063
So what are you saying?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.598
It's a fantasy.

28:52.631 --> 28:56.903
Or... maybe I should say
a core desire.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.405
Our friend here
is a memory machine.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.040
He remembers every moment
of every day.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.209
Now, if that was your condition,

29:03.242 --> 29:06.178
what might you wish for?

29:06.212 --> 29:08.047
To forget.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.018
I mean, it's beautiful, really.

29:12.051 --> 29:15.922
To live in the moment--
no past, no future.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.656
DAVID:
Yeah, but it's not real.

29:17.689 --> 29:21.260
CARY: It's real to him.
In this moment.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.729
What are you saying,
we should leave him here?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.564
I'm not saying anything.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.099
I'm merely making
an observation.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.535
What if it was Kerry?

29:31.637 --> 29:33.806
You're right.
Wake him up.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.847
How?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.449
I don't know.
You're the psychic.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.120
Hello.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.569
What happened?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.838
You don't remember?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.277
No.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.814
-The monk got loose.
-Yeah.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.950
Everyone's infected.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.252
-No.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.121
He has the kids--
the monk--

30:22.154 --> 30:24.156
and they're armed,
but they're... kids, so...

30:24.190 --> 30:25.925
I

30:25.958 --> 30:28.527
-Uh, pied piper, humming,
it's a long story.
-Yeah.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.108
Cow.

30:42.141 --> 30:45.777
-No. I need to find Syd.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.380
-We should split up.
-We stay together.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.449
-PTONOMY: Definitely.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.854
-I'm fine. Let's go.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.530
Oh, no.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.570
Uh, no, it's not safe here
out in the open.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.106
We should get her to your lab.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.740
Yes.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.309
How?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.629
All right.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.406
Here goes.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.345
-PTONOMY: Yeah, hold on.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.122
Is this...

32:37.123 --> 32:38.657
Was mine like this?

32:38.690 --> 32:41.093
No. You were in a garden.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.694
In a sharp suit.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.097
-Yeah.
-Stay close.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.783
-I don't know.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.918
-Yes.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.366
-It's...
-We're...
-DAVID: A game.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.834
I don't have time for games.
Melanie!

33:30.776 --> 33:32.844
-Go through the door.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.081
No. Look around first.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.817
Look...

33:38.850 --> 33:40.919
around.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.464
-Climb... down.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.274
-Climb back up.
-Jump.

34:17.256 --> 34:19.358
Ow.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.797
DAVID:
Is this Melanie?

34:25.831 --> 34:27.233
Is she doing this?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.067
CARY:
I think so.

34:29.101 --> 34:32.738
-Perhaps her core desire

34:32.771 --> 34:34.306
is to be omnipotent.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.508
To control
the uncontrollable world

34:36.542 --> 34:38.410
from a distance, so she's...

34:39.445 --> 34:41.079
...everywhere.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.083
*

34:58.430 --> 35:00.499
:
The Minotaur.

35:02.301 --> 35:05.937
-Look... around.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.153
Melanie?

35:21.187 --> 35:23.489
It's David!

35:23.522 --> 35:25.524
You have to talk to me.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.396
The monk got free.
Everybody's infected.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.931
You're trapped inside your mind!

35:32.964 --> 35:35.167
If you come down here,

35:35.201 --> 35:38.237
we'll... we can go home.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.672
Okay?

35:41.907 --> 35:44.210
-I don't know.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.828
-Let's, uh...
-Yes.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.235
-That was...
-A Minotaur, yes.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.637
But why was it in a doggie
wheelchair? I don't know.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.838
Guys, we can't just...

36:12.871 --> 36:14.973
I don't have time for this.

36:44.336 --> 36:47.706
Melanie, please!

36:47.739 --> 36:49.741
They need our help!

36:59.318 --> 37:01.320
*

37:31.216 --> 37:33.218
*

38:06.151 --> 38:09.388
That was-that was nice,
but I think we need another...

38:20.932 --> 38:24.536
Should I... hug you?

38:24.570 --> 38:26.572
Please don't.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.874
Let's just go.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.255
Is that... a...

38:44.289 --> 38:45.891
A cow. Yes.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.296
-Okay, that really needs
to stop now.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.632
Nothing. It's...
I think Syd's in trouble.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.402
We need to split up now.
Cary and I will look for Syd.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.336
Melanie, you and Paul
find Fukyama.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.971
Oh, what if we see the monk?

39:00.005 --> 39:02.007
Ask him what he wants.
Just don't get too close.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.675
You should be immune now, but...

39:03.709 --> 39:05.977
-Yeah. I did a little thing
before we left.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.979
You did a thing in my head?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.515
DAVID:
Just don't get too close.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.616
What about the cow?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.283
Leave it here.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.285
I don't think I want a cow
in my lab.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.622
Guys, I don't care.
I got to find Syd.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.758
Let's check the pedestal first.

39:25.330 --> 39:28.033
Don't touch anything.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.057
Cary?

40:06.104 --> 40:07.939
*

40:19.384 --> 40:22.153
David? Oh...

40:22.187 --> 40:23.555
David.

43:55.934 --> 43:57.936
*

44:37.242 --> 44:39.644
CARY :
David?

44:42.013 --> 44:44.049
David?

44:56.661 --> 44:58.663
Oh, no!

45:05.003 --> 45:07.005
:
Oh, fudge!

45:35.033 --> 45:37.235
I'm sorry.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.688
*

46:21.679 --> 46:23.614
We want the weapon.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.783
What weapon?

46:25.817 --> 46:27.718
To kill the monster.

46:27.752 --> 46:30.922
They did not tell us he was
a monster and we took him in.

46:30.956 --> 46:32.891
PTONOMY:
There is no weapon.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.759
VERMILLION 1:
To Division 3 they told us.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.361
If there is a problem, go there.

46:36.394 --> 46:37.462
They will have the weapon.

46:40.598 --> 46:44.269
Will have. Do not have.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.737
A weapon was planned,
but never built.

46:46.771 --> 46:48.306
The body was buried.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.608
Then a new crisis and another.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.110
Over time we forgot.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.812
Do not believe.
Where is the weapon?

46:54.846 --> 46:56.781
Where's the body?

46:56.814 --> 46:58.816
VERMILLION 1:
No. We do not say.

46:58.850 --> 47:01.386
He is out there as well,
looking for it,

47:01.419 --> 47:03.154
the Shadow King.

47:03.188 --> 47:04.355
He must not find it.

47:04.389 --> 47:07.325
The end of everything.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.429
David.

47:11.462 --> 47:12.998
He's the weapon.

47:13.031 --> 47:15.166
VERMILLION 1:
The King is too powerful.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.103
His body, it will not drown.

47:18.136 --> 47:20.471
It does not burn.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.874
David can do it.

47:22.908 --> 47:24.442
Do what?

47:26.477 --> 47:28.779
Destroy the Shadow King.

47:28.813 --> 47:31.282
VERMILLION 1:
No. We do not want his help.

47:31.316 --> 47:33.318
He cannot be trusted.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.385
He works with the...

47:36.821 --> 47:39.690
MONK:
Teleportation.

47:39.724 --> 47:41.960
DAVID: Just-just quiet
for a second. Let me think.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.929
And stop making people sick.

47:43.962 --> 47:46.297
MONK:
People don't matter.

47:46.331 --> 47:47.798
Only the body matters.

47:47.832 --> 47:50.301
Well, they matter to me.

47:50.335 --> 47:51.702
They're my people.

47:51.736 --> 47:54.139
But you help him, the King.

47:54.172 --> 47:58.143
-And he will kill all of them.
-I am not...

47:58.176 --> 48:01.712
I have seen your mind...

48:01.746 --> 48:03.214
as you have mine.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.829
Where's the body?

48:18.863 --> 48:20.631
We're not afraid to die.

48:20.665 --> 48:23.368
Nobody is gonna...
Look...

48:23.401 --> 48:26.771
I'm having a really hard time
finding the landmarks here.

48:26.804 --> 48:28.506
Minds separated from bodies

48:28.539 --> 48:31.076
and Minotaurs in mazes.

48:31.109 --> 48:32.510
You got a girlfriend?

48:32.543 --> 48:34.445
-Yeah, I got one.

48:34.479 --> 48:35.913
Well, I-I got two, actually.

48:35.947 --> 48:38.249
Well, no, just one,
but in two time periods,

48:38.283 --> 48:40.185
which raises the question:
is it just one?

48:40.218 --> 48:43.254
Huh? I mean,
people change, right?

48:43.288 --> 48:45.923
We change,
so maybe she's different now.

48:45.957 --> 48:47.892
In the future.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.961
I don't...

48:49.995 --> 48:51.296
The point is, I love her-- them.

48:51.329 --> 48:54.632
And more importantly,
I trust her.

48:54.665 --> 48:56.467
And she told me things happen.

48:56.501 --> 48:57.868
Okay? In the future. Bad things.

48:57.902 --> 49:00.371
So I have to, I have to help.

49:00.405 --> 49:01.506
It's complicated.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.408
Look, just tell me where it is.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.742
The monastery.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.144
It was a valley
and now it's a desert.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.478
That much I know.

49:07.512 --> 49:10.048
Destroy it.

49:10.081 --> 49:11.549
I will.

49:11.582 --> 49:13.118
No, you won't.

49:13.151 --> 49:15.353
I promise.

49:15.386 --> 49:18.089
Just tell me where it is.
I won't let anything bad happen.

49:18.123 --> 49:20.625
It already has.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.278
Syd!

49:42.280 --> 49:45.883
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.918
Oh.

52:11.329 --> 52:12.830
MAN: Now I get it.
