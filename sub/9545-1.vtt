00:12.279 --> 00:15.182
Harold!
You're early.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.417
I know.
I'm picking something up.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.187
Where's Peggy?

00:19.219 --> 00:22.489
Thought you two
were joined at the hip.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.719
[alarm beeps softly]

00:51.752 --> 00:54.322
[phone rings]

00:54.354 --> 00:55.588
Yes?

00:55.622 --> 00:56.689
(man on phone)
How's it going, Harold?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.125
I'm in.
I'm doing it.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.759
(man)
Friendly reminder...

00:59.792 --> 01:01.728
don't be a hero.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.132
We hear a police siren,
Peggy's dead.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.766
Is she okay?
Can I talk to her?

01:05.799 --> 01:06.799
Just hurry up.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.802
Please let me just talk to--
He--let me--hello?

01:43.236 --> 01:45.872
(man)
Back seat.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.810
Let her go.
You said you would.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.844
Pleasure doing business
with you, Harold.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.281
Come here, Peggy.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.182
(guard)
Harold!

01:55.216 --> 01:56.917
Everything all right?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.218
Paul, I'm okay.
No problem.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.820
Get out of the car!

02:00.853 --> 02:02.489
(guard)
Both of you!

02:02.522 --> 02:03.757
Do it!

02:05.759 --> 02:07.760
Okay!

02:09.697 --> 02:12.500
Happy Halloween, man.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.667
Just relax.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.269
[gunshots]

02:15.302 --> 02:17.337
Vic! What did you do?
No choice.
Him or me.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.507
(driver)
We could've just driven off!
Get in the car!

02:19.539 --> 02:21.609
(Harold)
I didn't see anything.
I didn't see your face.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.776
Neither did Peggy,
did you, sweetie?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.179
I'm not done.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.447
No!

02:26.479 --> 02:27.781
Ah!

02:27.814 --> 02:31.218

02:37.457 --> 02:41.228
* Disorder and confusion
everywhere *

02:41.262 --> 02:43.930

02:43.963 --> 02:45.199

* It's a jungle out there

(Natalie)
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.466
Everybody's waiting.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.468
It's over there.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.770
What?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.006
Dog, you know...

03:59.038 --> 04:01.474
Dog...doo.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.710
Did you step in it?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.278
If I stepped in it,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.046
I'd be in that ambulance
right now

04:07.080 --> 04:09.417
on my way to the emergency room,
wouldn't I?

04:09.449 --> 04:12.385
Praying for the sweet release
that only death can bring.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.754
So, Monk, what do you think?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.358
Who are we looking for?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.559
Uh, I'd say it's a terrier.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.394
A Yorkie,
maybe a Chihuahua.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.396
Probably miles away by now.
We'll never catch him.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.932
He can't concentrate
because of the--

04:25.966 --> 04:28.435
Because of the what?

04:28.468 --> 04:31.838
[whispers]
The dog poo.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.643
Lieutenant?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.514
Clean that up
for me, would you?

04:41.548 --> 04:44.951
Thanks.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.420
Sergeant?

04:46.454 --> 04:48.555
Yes, sir?

04:48.588 --> 04:51.625
Clean that up.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.728
No, don't.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.704
Sir, you can't park there.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.038
It's all right.
It's okay.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.874
I'm a detective.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.343
I'm a detective.
One second. Here we go.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.879
Here we, um...
Hold that.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.680
I got it.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.584
I usually keep it right...

05:16.617 --> 05:18.985
Oh, I got it.
Here we go.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.422
Marty Eels,
Private Investigator.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.091
I'm here to save your butts.
Captain!

05:24.124 --> 05:26.526
Captain Stottlemeyer!

05:26.560 --> 05:28.596
Oh, hell.
Who's that?

05:28.629 --> 05:31.731
Marty Eels.
He's a Private Investigator.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.968
Nickel and dime stuff.
Divorces, insurance fraud.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.937
He's a professional
pain in the ass.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
Hey, Captain.
Captain, you're looking great!

05:39.105 --> 05:40.908
You're losing weight or
your shirts are getting bigger.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.742
Marty.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.012
I heard the D.A.
pulled your license.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.747
No, no, that was just
a temporary suspension.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.680
No, no, no.
No, no.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.582
That was just
a little misunderstanding.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.584
A misunderstanding?

05:50.617 --> 05:51.851
Well, that's all ancient
history anyway, so...

05:51.884 --> 05:54.120
So I was just, you know, riding
around in the neighborhood.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.122
And I heard a call go out
on the police scanner--

05:56.156 --> 05:57.425
Look, Marty,
I'm busy.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.894
Yeah, that's why I thought I'd
come down here and lend a hand.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.696
So what do we got?
The jewelry store was robbed.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.064
Well, that's obvious.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.834
We got a dead Rent-A-Cop
and a missing store manager.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.101
So, let me guess, you're
thinking the store manager--

06:09.136 --> 06:10.603
Yeah, something like that.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.838
So let me look around, huh?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.473
I mean, an extra pair
of eyes can't hurt.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.708
And who knows?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.410
I could see something
you guys are missing.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.110
We're not missing anything,
Mr. Eels.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.579
We've got a CSI team here.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.814
And, uh, see that man
over there?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.550
(Disher)
That's Adrian Monk.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.918
I think we're
in pretty good hands.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.954
Captain, Monk says I can't
just throw this away.

06:27.987 --> 06:31.425
I gotta take it, like,
a mile away and bury it.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.925
Could I see that?

06:32.959 --> 06:35.194
Yeah.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.598
You can't throw this away.
This--this is evidence.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.036
This is fresh. Mmph.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.840
I'd say this is less
than 90 minutes old.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.576
Marty--

06:48.608 --> 06:49.308
But isn't that
when you said

06:49.341 --> 06:51.110
all this was
probably going down?

06:51.144 --> 06:53.146
The dog could've belonged
to the victim

06:53.180 --> 06:55.682
or to one of the perps.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.518
[scoffs]
I think this is important.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.620
Monk was gonna
throw this away.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.891
Um, you know,
he might be right.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.860
Let's, um, book that
into evidence.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.629
Yes, sir.
Captain, look.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.600
(Marty)
Did that store manager
live in Oakland?

07:13.634 --> 07:17.471
Yeah,
how'd you know that?

07:17.504 --> 07:18.471
That's his dog.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.139
(Marty)
That's from Oakland.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.711
You can see the blue license
on its collar.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.713
What, you can see
that from here?

07:25.745 --> 07:29.716
A little something
I call "attention to detail."

07:29.750 --> 07:32.252
But--
[laughs]

07:32.284 --> 07:34.588
Go get the dog.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.191
Adrian Monk,
Natalie Teeger,

07:38.225 --> 07:40.060
this is Marty Eels.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.661
He's a private investigator.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.230
Hey, how you doin'?
How you doin'?

07:43.262 --> 07:44.898
I hear good things.
Good things.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.966
Don't worry.
I'm not competition.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.266
I'm just here to help.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.103
Can I have one of those?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.271
So...what have we got?

07:52.305 --> 07:55.808
Captain, I don't think
the manager did this.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.178
For one thing, he didn't lock
the door behind him.

07:59.211 --> 08:02.048
Plus, I notice some
more blood by the curb.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.916
I think there was
a second shooting.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.218
Yeah, he could be right.
Very good. Nicely done.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.288
Nicely done.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Captain!

08:08.321 --> 08:10.591
He's right.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.225
I think he belongs
to the store manager.

08:12.259 --> 08:16.295
"Harold Gumbal.
Geary St., Oakland."

08:16.329 --> 08:19.165
You know, if the manager was
robbing his own store,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.067
he wouldn't bring
his dog along.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.302
Or leave him behind.

08:22.334 --> 08:23.803
No, the manager
is not the guy.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.572
No, that's right.
The manager is not the guy.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.807
Here's what happ--
Here's what happened.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.542
Here's what happened.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.577
This dog was a hostage.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.312
The manager was being forced
to rob his store.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.149
Something went wrong,
and they shot the guard.

08:38.350 --> 08:41.520
(Marty)
Excuse me.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.663
What the hell
is he doing?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.299
Captain...
Well, he did spot
the dog's license

08:53.332 --> 08:55.302
from a block away.

08:55.335 --> 08:59.172
Okay. They drove off
in Gumbal's car.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.607
They headed south.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.643
They're going to dump it
as soon as they can.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.943
We're already checking
the airport.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.077
No, that's a waste of time.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.279
They would never go there.
There's too much security.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.782
Try the train station.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.049
Train station.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.620
Yeah.
Try San Bruno...

09:12.653 --> 09:14.621
or Millbrae.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.956
They probably panicked
when they shot the guard.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.693
Maybe they dropped
the gun

09:20.727 --> 09:24.764
or some bloody clothes
somewhere nearby.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.365
[sniffing]
What--what are you
doing there?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.936
What--

09:28.969 --> 09:34.006
This dog has been sniffing
around a sewer recently.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.210
See these sewer grates
around here?

09:37.244 --> 09:40.312
The perps might have stuffed
something down in there

09:40.346 --> 09:43.250
and maybe this dog
saw them do it.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.686
You gotta be kidding.
He's--he's kidding, right?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.855
He's joking.
The man is joking.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.057
It'll just take
two minutes to check it.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.161
Officer!

09:54.193 --> 09:55.361
Take a look
in that sewer grate.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.898
Captain.
From smelling a dog.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.667
That's impossible.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.236
Captain!

10:04.270 --> 10:05.839
They were stuffed
down the drain

10:05.873 --> 10:07.039
just like he said.

10:15.883 --> 10:16.850
(Marty)
No.

10:16.884 --> 10:20.386
No, mom.
I wasn't on the news.

10:20.419 --> 10:23.255
'Cause there were no reporters
there yet.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.359
Mm-hmm.
I found a lot of clues.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.360
I found three or four
big clues.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.363
Cap-Captain was very
impressed with me.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.398
Wait. He just
walked in.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.332
He'll tell you.
One second.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.433
Captain,

10:34.466 --> 10:35.534
it's my mother.

10:35.567 --> 10:38.404
Tell her--tell her how good
I was on the crime scene.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.275
Uh, Mrs. Eels?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.412
Hi. Uh, yeah.
Marty did great.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.846
You'd be very proud of him.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.448
He's a first-rate
detective.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.384
I look forward
to meeting you too, ma'am.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.352
Okay, bye-bye.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.822
What were those beeps?

10:55.855 --> 10:56.923
She was--she was at work.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.859
She works for Pacific
Global Airlines.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.028
She's a--she's a quality
control operator.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.361
Come on. Come.

11:02.394 --> 11:04.264
Come on in.
Sit down. Sit down.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.767
Here. Natalie,
come sit down.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.301
Come sit down.
Make yourself at home.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.302
Monk, sit.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.005
Sit anywhere.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm not fine.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.942
Did he just say
he's not fine?
Yeah.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.277
So, Captain,

11:17.309 --> 11:20.379
am I on the case
or what?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.448
First, I have to ask you
a couple questions.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.753
Where were you
yesterday morning at 8:00?

11:25.786 --> 11:28.221
You mean, when the robbery
was happening?

11:28.254 --> 11:30.791
You guys think I had something
to do with that?

11:30.823 --> 11:34.293
Why? Because you can't keep up
with me on a crime scene?

11:34.326 --> 11:36.897
Where were you, Marty?

11:36.929 --> 11:38.230
I was at the hospital.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.900
St. Andrew's.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.335
They thought I had
a concussion.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.071
What happened?

11:44.104 --> 11:47.039
Well...

11:47.073 --> 11:48.375
that's kind of embarrassing.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.211
I, um, I got hit
very hard by a client.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.413
Hit me very hard.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.749
Yeah. Um...

11:55.783 --> 11:59.086
I was, um, supposed
to follow his wife

11:59.119 --> 12:00.486
and take pictures.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.159
Whoa.
She was cheating on him.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.296
No. No.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.431
That--that--that's him.
That's my client.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.232
(Natalie)
You burst in
and took a picture

12:13.265 --> 12:15.368
of a man in bed
with his own wife?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.769
Yes, I did.
I made a mistake.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.773
I'm human.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.841
So the bottom line is
I was at the hospital

12:21.875 --> 12:23.442
when the jewelry thing
was happening.

12:23.475 --> 12:24.376
You can call them.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.413
We will.
Why is it so hard

12:26.446 --> 12:28.514
for you guys to believe
that I'm just this good?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.817
Because, Marty, you were never
this good before.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.352
In fact,
you sorta sucked.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.288
Well, I-I-I've been
teaching myself.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.323
I've been--
I've learned how to focus.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.991
And that's really
the secret.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.192
Focus.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.461
Am I right
about the focus thing?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.462
Bay Area Center
Continuing Education.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.398
Is that
a correspondence school?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.168
It's fully accredited.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.303
What school
did you go to?
Berkeley.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.974
That's a good school.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.475
I believe they're
fully accredited too.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.010
Yeah. Yeah,
they're fully accredited.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.280
So, Captain,
am I on the case or what?

13:01.313 --> 13:04.150
I mean, put me in,
Coach.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.352
I found the--I found
the ski masks, didn't I?

13:06.385 --> 13:08.421
Look, Marty,
even if I wanted to,

13:08.455 --> 13:09.990
I just don't have
the budget

13:10.023 --> 13:13.259
to hire
two consultants.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.028
I-I-I tell you--
I tell you what.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.196
I tell you what.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.865
You don't have to pay me
dime one

13:17.898 --> 13:18.966
unless I get some results.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.167
So th-th-this
costs you nothing.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.400
Captain, could I...?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.078
You can't hire
this guy.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.346
He did find
the ski masks.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.981
By smellin a dog.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.448
It's not possible.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.320
Look, Monk, sometimes
when you're picking up clues,

13:40.352 --> 13:42.154
it seems like magic
to me.

13:42.188 --> 13:45.125
I don't know
how you do it.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.427
Maybe he's doing something
that you don't understand.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.296
I think he's cheating.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.898
[cell phone rings]

13:50.931 --> 13:52.198
Yes, sir.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.399
This isn't
the fourth grade, Monk.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.001
He's cheating.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.370
How?
How.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.072
I don't know.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.640
We just found
the store manager's car.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.210
Guess where it was.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.047
Near a train station?

14:07.080 --> 14:10.017
In San Bruno.
Outstanding.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.217
You called it, Marty.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.284
(Captain)
Let's go check it out.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.187
Marty, come here.
You ride with me.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.361
He's cheating.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.557
'Scuse me.
'Scuse me, I'm--

14:51.591 --> 14:54.661
Go ahead.
No, no. After you.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.895
Please.

15:02.434 --> 15:03.971
Pretty weird, huh?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.974
Maybe we should send
one of them home.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.274
Yeah, but which one?

15:08.307 --> 15:10.610
(woman)
Marty Eels.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.946
E-E-L-S.
Like the fish.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.115
He's always wanted
to be a detective.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.418
He used to stay up late
reading Hardy Boys stories

15:18.451 --> 15:19.619
under the cover.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.054
So your son

15:22.088 --> 15:24.224
is helping
Adrian Monk?

15:24.256 --> 15:27.527
Who's helping who?
That's the question.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.267
I love that.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.668
Love the, uh,
the thing you do

15:35.701 --> 15:37.037
with your hands.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.571
It's very old school.
Thank you.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.621
What are you doing?

15:55.654 --> 15:58.357
Mud.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.393
You can tell where
the car has been.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.395
From tasting it.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.230
He's tasting the mud.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.631
Does that work?
No!

16:05.664 --> 16:07.366
It's just nuts.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.308
Captain, how tall
was the store manager?

16:16.342 --> 16:19.678
Uh, 5'10" according
to his driver's license.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.515
Hmm.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.317
Somebody else
was driving this car

16:25.351 --> 16:27.320
because that--that chair
has been adjusted

16:27.354 --> 16:29.288
for somebody 5'11".

16:29.322 --> 16:31.691
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.427
It's impossible
to know that.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.463
Seat adjustments
are not that exact.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.566
[whispering]
Should I write down 5'11"?

16:39.599 --> 16:43.269
Uh, I don't know. Yes.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.604
In pencil.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.710
Well [clears throat]
here we go.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.812
This map was, uh,
used recently.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.383
That means that the, uh,
the driver was not familiar

16:56.415 --> 16:57.350
with this particular area.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.052
I-I-I had that one.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.486
You didn't say anything.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.721
I was waiting
my turn.

17:02.754 --> 17:05.724
I had that one.
Captain...

17:05.758 --> 17:07.227
He's cheating.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.560
He's cheating.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.396
He saw me looking.

17:14.834 --> 17:18.404
And this car was driven
on Highway 47.

17:18.438 --> 17:22.342
And how do you happen
to know that?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.509
It's all in the details,
Captain.

17:23.542 --> 17:28.847
See the dead bugs
on the windshield.

17:28.881 --> 17:34.354
This is a gray
bantam wing mosquito.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.256
Which are most common where?

17:36.288 --> 17:38.290
Anybody?

17:38.325 --> 17:39.791
Walter Creek Reservoir.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.429
In Livingston.
Highway 47.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.364
That's fantastic.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.566
"Bantam wing
mosquitoes."

17:46.598 --> 17:48.134
Gentlemen,
let's pop the trunk.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.301
Monk.

17:55.907 --> 17:58.444
This blood
is still fresh.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.248
Yes, it is.
Good for you.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.217
Write that down.
One for Monk.

18:04.250 --> 18:09.256
All right, Gumbal
was dragged out of the car.

18:09.288 --> 18:13.660
And into these woods.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.828
Okey-doke.
Here we go.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.371
These leaves
were recently crushed.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.306
I'm one-sixteenth
Cherokee.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.575
Cool.
I thought he might be.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.284
Now what's he doing?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.618
I can't look.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.421
Oh, he's using
a divining rod.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.888
The Indians used
to use them.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.290
He's one-sixteenth
Cherokee.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.291
Ooh, that's my boy.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.161
Can everybody see okay?

18:48.194 --> 18:51.431
Take lots of pictures.
Film is cheap.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.511
I think I found
the store manager.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.348
(Stottlemeyer)
Stay back! Stay back!

19:09.382 --> 19:10.650
Get outta here!

19:10.682 --> 19:12.785
(Disher)
Back off, back off.
Get these guys outta here.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.422
(Stottlemeyer)
He was shot in the chest.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.154
Call the coroner's office.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.557
Get the crime scene guys
up here.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.326
Give me
a 20-foot perimeter now!

19:19.358 --> 19:20.593
All right, let's go.
You heard the man!

19:20.626 --> 19:22.429
Take ten steps back!
Let's go, let's go!

19:22.461 --> 19:23.296
Get these things outta here.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.963
Baker, come on,
move these guys down!

19:24.997 --> 19:28.300
That's interesting.
What?

19:28.335 --> 19:32.638
Really?
You don't see that?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.839
Look at his arms.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.242
That is
an unnatural position.

19:36.276 --> 19:41.748
I think he was trying
to tell us something.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.450
With his dying breath,

19:43.482 --> 19:45.451
he was trying
to send us a message.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.952
[sarcastically]
With his dying breath.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.721
He was trying to tell us

19:48.755 --> 19:51.691
the name of the man
who killed him.

19:51.723 --> 19:52.825
Look.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.396
He's pointing
to his watch.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.664
No, he's not.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.500
Captain,
are there any perps

20:00.532 --> 20:04.671
who do a job like this
by the name of Casio?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.472
Casio?

20:06.506 --> 20:07.973
Lefty?
Captain.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.910
Dial?

20:10.942 --> 20:12.744
Eddie Dial.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.013
He just did seven years
in Folsom

20:15.047 --> 20:17.317
for kidnapping
and bank robbery.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.787
He just made parole.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.324
Well, let's check him out.
Yes, sir.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.424
Baker!

20:25.458 --> 20:27.460
Johnson!

20:37.436 --> 20:39.306
Mom, have you seen
my camera?

20:39.338 --> 20:41.773
Uh-uh. Did you check
your jacket?

20:41.807 --> 20:42.775
What about
your pockets?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.477
Yes.
I looked everywhere.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.811
Well, I haven't
seen it, honey.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.780
Why don't you ask Mr. Monk
to help you?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.717
Please, Mr. Monk,
it has all my photos in it

20:50.750 --> 20:52.484
from my school trip.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.786
I was
the official photographer.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.922
If I lose it,
I'm going to get an incomplete.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.459
When did you see it last?

20:59.491 --> 21:02.862
I saw it yesterday
in the living room.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.342
(Monk)
That plant
has been moved recently.

21:15.375 --> 21:19.912
That's right.
How did you know?

21:19.945 --> 21:23.450
Normally they lean
toward the sun.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.051
This one is leaning
the other way.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.421
Hello.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.461
Oh, Mr. Monk,
thank you so much.

21:35.494 --> 21:36.462
You're the best.
Isn't he the best?

21:36.496 --> 21:40.400
There's no one better.
You really are amazing.

21:40.432 --> 21:41.601
(Monk)
Wait.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.836
When did you water this?

21:44.871 --> 21:47.606
Oh, uh, this morning.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.442
(Monk)
The camera could not
have been back there

21:49.476 --> 21:51.711
this morning.

21:51.743 --> 21:55.781
It would have gotten wet.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.884
Thanks for trying, Julie.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.986
My mom put me
up to this.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.397
Mr. Monk, you really
are amazing.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.834
You're probably the best
in the world.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.134
[cell phone rings]

22:16.167 --> 22:18.136
And you're right
about this Marty character.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.806
He's cheating.
I don't know.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.540
He is.
Hello?

22:21.574 --> 22:24.644
Yes, sir.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.846
Really?

22:26.878 --> 22:30.416
Okay, okay.
We're on our way.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.718
They just caught one
of the killers.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.586
They're questioning
him now.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.087
Julie, we'll be back
soon, honey.

22:36.122 --> 22:41.461
Natalie, it's not Eddie Dial.
Is it?

22:41.493 --> 22:44.463
Yeah.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.171
(Captain)
We found the manager's wallet

22:52.203 --> 22:55.474
in your motel room, Eddie.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.808
It's over.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.144
We own you.

22:58.176 --> 23:00.112
Look, man,
I didn't hurt anybody.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.949
Okay?
I didn't even have a gun.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.817
Well, two people
are dead, Edward.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.421
Who did the shooting?

23:08.454 --> 23:10.021
I'm willing to bet you
it was that guy.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.090
Blanchard, Victor P.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.126
The two of you were
seen together last weekend.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.962
Where is he, Eddie?
I don't know.

23:16.996 --> 23:21.500
Captain, may I?

23:34.547 --> 23:35.981
Where's your--
where's your partner, Eddie?

23:37.849 --> 23:41.854
I don't know.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.691
Hmm, he's telling the truth.
He doesn't know.

23:44.723 --> 23:45.692
Do you have a map?

23:45.724 --> 23:47.960
He's like
a human lie detector.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.596
Oh, I can't believe it.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.163
I can't believe it either.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.832
Well, he's doing it.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.166
Well, I still
don't believe it.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.136
What you see happening
in the next room,

23:58.170 --> 23:59.806
it's impossible.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.508
It's just...

24:03.710 --> 24:04.943
What is this?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.614
Stuff we found
in Eddie's motel room,

24:07.646 --> 24:10.215
including a pair of tickets
to Costa Rica.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.951
(Natalie)
Did you guys find the jewels?

24:11.983 --> 24:14.653
No, not yet.
Marty'll find them.

24:14.686 --> 24:19.191
(Marty)
Now, then, Eddie,
where did you hide the jewels?

24:19.224 --> 24:21.059
Was it here?

24:21.093 --> 24:24.997
No. Uh, was it here?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.166
No.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.136
Uh, how 'bout here?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.740
Ah, getting warmer.

24:33.772 --> 24:37.276
Did you hide them
here, Eddie?

24:37.308 --> 24:42.749
Ah, yes.
They're in the state park.

24:42.781 --> 24:45.084
Get outta here.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.153
(Stottlemeyer)
I know this area.

24:47.185 --> 24:48.688
There's a water tower
right here.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.190
Oh, did you, uh,

24:51.222 --> 24:55.193
did you hide them near
the water tower, Eddie?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.566
Hmmm, bingo.

24:59.598 --> 25:02.602
Yes.

25:08.339 --> 25:11.176
(Stottlemeyer)
Call Dunlop
in the Parks Department.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.078
Tell him
to meet us there.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.145
And tell him
to bring some shovels.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.650
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna write this up.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.318
Marty.
Oh, Mr. Monk.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.788
All right, why don't
you guys go ahead?

25:22.821 --> 25:24.557
I'll meet you there.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.596
He's cheating!

25:30.630 --> 25:32.263
What, Monk?
How is he cheating?

25:32.298 --> 25:35.000
We've got a suspect
who just confessed.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.202
He found the car.
He found the body.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.270
He is solving this case
single-handedly.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.207
By cheating!

25:41.240 --> 25:42.842
Natalie,
what do you think?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.977
I believe my boss.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.313
[sighs]
Anyway, we better go.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.980
Should we take one car
or two cars?

25:49.015 --> 25:51.651
Monk, why don't
you stay here?

25:51.683 --> 25:55.253
We're gonna let
Marty take this one.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.189
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.224
You're firing him?
No. No.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.929
Um, it's just that Marty
seems to be in a zone.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.096
He's got a handle
on this one.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.898
You get the next one,
okay?

26:06.932 --> 26:10.702
I'll call you.
I gotta go.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.650
(Dr. Kroger)
So they found the jewels?

26:23.682 --> 26:25.652
They were right where
Marty said they'd be.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.753
Of course.

26:27.787 --> 26:32.191
And what, then they asked you
to step aside?

26:32.223 --> 26:35.361
They said Marty
was on a roll.

26:35.394 --> 26:40.666
I guess they didn't
want me to cramp his style.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.667
Well, Adrian, I'm sure

26:41.701 --> 26:44.269
that this is all
just temporary.

26:46.972 --> 26:50.009
Maybe he really is
better than me.

26:50.041 --> 26:55.213
Yeah, well,
would that be so terrible?

26:55.247 --> 26:58.884
I mean if you
weren't number one?

27:01.353 --> 27:06.291
An ex-cop I know teaches
criminal justice

27:06.325 --> 27:08.027
at Fulton College.

27:08.059 --> 27:12.163
He offered me a job
last year.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.865
Maybe I'll give him
a call.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.734
All right,
so you're just giving up.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.103
Okay.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.369
No, no, Adrian,
I'm not suggesting

27:18.403 --> 27:20.873
that you just give up.

27:20.906 --> 27:24.143
I'm saying to you that there is
always someone ahead of you.

27:24.175 --> 27:25.243
This is
the human condition.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.279
For instance, there's
a new psychiatrist here in town

27:28.314 --> 27:29.414
name of Lowenstern.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.684
Now, I know that there
is no way

27:32.719 --> 27:35.320
that I will ever be--
well, as good as he is.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.355
I know this.
I accept it.

27:37.388 --> 27:39.325
He's better than you?

27:39.357 --> 27:40.960
He's brilliant.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.461
Nominated for a Nobel Prize.

27:42.493 --> 27:45.998
But, the point is, you think
that you might enjoy teaching.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.365
I don't know.

27:47.398 --> 27:50.435
Tell me more about
this Lowenstern.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.202
Lowenstern.
I could introduce you.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.838
Office is right
across the street.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.741
He charges $400 an hour.

27:58.509 --> 28:01.279
So where were we?

28:01.313 --> 28:03.249
Okay.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.856
Oh!
Good morning, boss.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.391
They were out
of the round sponges.

28:12.423 --> 28:14.292
Don't panic, I'll pick some up
on the way home.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.894
Don't worry
about the groceries.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.864
You're driving me
to Fulton College.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.330
I have an appointment.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.432
You mean now?

28:20.465 --> 28:22.367
11:00.
I'm meeting the Dean.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.136
You're just gonna quit.
Just like that.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.073
I think I would
make a very good teacher.

28:27.105 --> 28:30.142
Oh, Mr. Monk,
you'd make a terrible teacher.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.377
It would take you four weeks
to correct one paper.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.445
You're a detective.
You're a great detective.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.347
Are you gonna drive me
or not?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.316
No.
No, I am not.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.517
Your feelings are hurt

28:38.549 --> 28:40.486
and you're just
not thinking straight.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.221
Fine.
Fine, I'll take a taxi.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.757
[chuckles]
You're gonna take a taxi?

28:44.790 --> 28:46.092
Do you know what
people do in taxis?

28:46.125 --> 28:49.394
Fine!
Fine, I will drive myself.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.397
I'll rent a car.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.465
See?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.501
I am dialing the number.
I'm not bluffing.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.170
Do you even have
a driver's license?

28:58.203 --> 29:00.306
Yes, I have
a license.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.008
Okay, this is it.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.442
This is the last digit.

29:03.474 --> 29:06.211
I have dialed the number.
It is ringing.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.079
Thank you for calling
Cannon Rent-A-Car.

29:08.114 --> 29:11.049
This call may be monitored
for quality purposes.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.351
I am on hold.

29:12.384 --> 29:16.321
Mr. Monk, Fulton College
is 100 miles away.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.891
It is up the interstate.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.859
It's over a bridge.
I know.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.130
I have a blindfold
for going over bridges.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.798
But you'll be driving.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.034
Good point.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.300
I think I can make it.

29:29.335 --> 29:32.070
I'll just sort of peek
underneath.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.205
I'm not gonna
let you drive!

29:34.240 --> 29:35.374
You've never driven
over a bridge in your life!

29:35.406 --> 29:37.276
What choice do I have?

29:37.308 --> 29:40.479
(woman on phone)
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir?

29:40.511 --> 29:41.346
Yes?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.515
My daughter goes
to Fulton College.

29:43.548 --> 29:44.983
You don't have
to take the bridge.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.853
You can take the causeway
all the way up.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.319
You could hear us?

29:48.354 --> 29:49.188
Yes, sir.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.490
I'm a quality control
operator.

29:51.522 --> 29:54.393
I'm monitoring the call.

29:54.425 --> 29:55.560
I was on hold.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.229
Yes, sir.

29:57.262 --> 30:01.599
We start listening
as soon as you're connected.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.535
You wouldn't believe
the things I hear.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.904
People fooling around,
people arguing.

30:05.938 --> 30:09.407
I could write
a book about it.

30:09.441 --> 30:13.211
You could hear me
while I was on hold.

30:15.646 --> 30:18.616
[dance rock]

30:18.650 --> 30:24.891
*

30:26.959 --> 30:30.461
Hey, Monk!
What a nice surprise.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.596
This guy's from
San Francisco Magazine.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.233
I'm one of the ten most eligible
bachelors in the city.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.501
Can you believe it?

30:36.535 --> 30:37.936
Marty, we need to talk.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.371
Not a good time, Nat.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.472
Did you just call me Nat?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.541
Hey! Hey, get one
with me and Monk.
No.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.111
Here. No, no, no.
This is good.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.046
It's like a summit
of great minds.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.280
Philip Marlowe
meets Sherlock Holmes.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.451
It's about your mother.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.353
A little something

30:54.385 --> 30:55.922
she might have overheard
while at work.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.391
The music's too loud.
I can't hear.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.425
Take--take a five.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.928
Take a five.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.333
(Natalie)
We know how
you did it, Marty.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.167
We figured it out.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.202
How I did what?

31:11.237 --> 31:13.505
Didn't your mother ever tell you
that cheaters never win?

31:13.538 --> 31:16.909
Actually, it was
your mother's idea.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.676
She works for Pacific
Global Airlines, doesn't she,

31:18.710 --> 31:20.645
in the quality control
department?

31:20.679 --> 31:24.182
Yeah, so?

31:24.215 --> 31:27.419
(woman on phone)
Your call may be monitored
for quality purposes.

31:27.452 --> 31:28.921
(Monk)
Here's what happened.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.156
After the murderers,
Blanchard and Dial,

31:31.190 --> 31:33.025
went back
to their motel room,

31:33.058 --> 31:34.625
counted their jewels.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.061
And then they called
the airlines

31:36.095 --> 31:37.195
to buy plane tickets
to Costa Rica.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.965
They were put on hold.

31:39.999 --> 31:43.335
What they didn't know
was that your mother

31:43.368 --> 31:47.573
was already on the line
monitoring their call.

31:47.605 --> 31:50.108
They must have been on hold
for quite a while,

31:50.142 --> 31:51.343
because they talked
about everything.

31:51.376 --> 31:55.280
Who they killed,
where they dumped the car.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.282
Even where
they hid the masks.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.984
(Natalie)
But she didn't call the police.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.385
She called you.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.653
And told you everything
you needed to know

32:01.686 --> 32:03.154
to solve the case.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.557
Or at least pretend
to solve it.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.263
You're a very smart man.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.101
Yeah, he's the real thing.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.667
Yeah.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.471
Of course, you realize
you have no proof

32:20.506 --> 32:21.707
for any of this.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.143
Don't airlines
record phone conversations?

32:24.175 --> 32:26.412
Yes, Nat,
I believe they do.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.746
Yes, they certainly do.

32:27.778 --> 32:30.281
But those conversations
have a way of being

32:30.316 --> 32:33.184
accidentally erased.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.086
So it's really
your word against mine.

32:35.121 --> 32:38.423
And who do you think
everyone's gonna believe?

32:38.457 --> 32:43.194
The amazing Marty Eels...

32:43.229 --> 32:45.530
or yesterday's news?

32:45.564 --> 32:49.268
[phone rings]

32:49.300 --> 32:50.669
Phone's been ringing
off the hook.

32:50.701 --> 32:54.140
Cases, cases, cases.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.406
Would you mind?

33:10.056 --> 33:11.789
Hey, Eels Investigations.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.260
(Vic)
Hey, Marty, I got
a proposition for you.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.327
Who's this?

33:16.362 --> 33:17.395
My name's Vic.
We never met.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.798
I think you know my partner,
though, Eddie Dial.

33:19.830 --> 33:21.400
In fact,
you and your friends

33:21.432 --> 33:23.201
arrested him yesterday.

33:23.234 --> 33:24.202
How did you get this number?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.604
This is my private line.

33:25.636 --> 33:28.140
It's the first number
on your mother's speed dial.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.240
My mother?

33:29.275 --> 33:30.241
Did you really think

33:30.276 --> 33:32.243
you could screw with me
and get away with it?

33:32.278 --> 33:33.479
Where is she?

33:33.511 --> 33:35.447
I just left her.
She's fine.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.284
For now.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.718
If you wanna see her again,
listen carefully.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.353
The jewels belong to me.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.387
I want them back.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.689
The jewels?

33:43.721 --> 33:45.557
Bring them to the
Dunn Street bus terminal

33:45.590 --> 33:46.525
by 8:00.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.660
Put them in locker 240
on the upper level.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.461
I got a spare key.
Wait a minute!

33:50.496 --> 33:52.364
I--I can't get
to the jewels.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.432
They're--they're locked up.
They're in evidence.

33:54.465 --> 33:55.233
You can do it, Marty.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.835
I've been reading
all about you.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.403
You're the flavor
of the month.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.405
Just tell them you wanna
examine the evidence.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.074
Tell you wanna use it
to set a trap.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.076
I don't care
what you tell them, okay?

34:04.109 --> 34:05.510
Just get 'em back.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.613
Oh, and Marty.

34:07.645 --> 34:08.614
What?

34:08.646 --> 34:10.481
No cops.
Come alone.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.351
Remember, if anything
happens to me,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.820
your mother's dead
by 8:20.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.695
Mr. Monk!
Mr. Monk!

34:24.730 --> 34:25.731
Wait!

34:25.764 --> 34:26.731
Wait, Mr. Monk!

34:26.764 --> 34:29.335
Mr. Monk, wait!
Wait!

34:29.367 --> 34:30.635
It's Vic Blanchard.
He just called.

34:30.668 --> 34:31.737
He's got my mother.

34:31.769 --> 34:33.105
My God.
I'll call the captain.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.505
No, no!
No, no cops.

34:34.539 --> 34:36.442
He said no cops
or he'd kill her.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.445
Mr. Monk, please,
you gotta help me.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.780
You were right!
I don't know what I'm doing!

34:41.813 --> 34:44.315
I don't.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.516
Let's go.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.525
Let's just go over this
one more time.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.228
Can you think
of anything else

34:56.262 --> 34:57.596
he might've said
on the phone?

34:57.628 --> 34:58.730
No cops!

34:58.764 --> 35:01.367
He said if he
even smells a cop,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.168
she's dead!
Oh, my gosh,
Marty, for the tenth time,

35:03.202 --> 35:04.170
no one's calling the cops.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.704
She's right.
Marty, look.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.539
We know where he's gonna be
at 8:00.

35:07.572 --> 35:08.706
If we can find your mother

35:08.739 --> 35:11.242
before that time, then the cops
can pick him up then.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.378
I know, I know.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.711
Ah!
Natalie--

35:13.744 --> 35:15.213
I got it.
It's all over--

35:15.246 --> 35:16.614
I'm on it!

35:16.648 --> 35:18.384
Marty, can you just please
sit on the couch, all right?

35:18.416 --> 35:20.786
You're making Mr. Monk
very nervous.

35:20.818 --> 35:23.155
All right, one more time.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.324
Okay, the kidnapper said
he just left her, right?

35:25.356 --> 35:26.925
So she can't be too far

35:26.958 --> 35:28.594
from where he made
that phone call.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.661
Do you remember anything else

35:30.695 --> 35:31.797
about the phone call?

35:31.829 --> 35:33.199
Like what?

35:33.231 --> 35:34.333
Like what?
Like anything!

35:34.365 --> 35:35.601
Noises in the background.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.802
I don't know!

35:37.835 --> 35:38.836
He doesn't know.
Oh, my God.

35:38.869 --> 35:39.871
This wasn't even my idea.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.306
My mother made me do this.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.675
She forced me into it.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.510
She said it was the only way
a loser like me

35:45.543 --> 35:47.478
was ever gonna be able
to solve a real crime.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.715
She sounds delightful.
Hey, that's my mother.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.717
Where do you get off talking
about somebody else's mother?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.418
What's wrong with you?
Okay, Marty, Marty!

35:53.452 --> 35:55.320
Marty, Marty, concentrate.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.289
Can you please just try
to think.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.490
You must have heard something.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.264
Yeah, uh...

36:06.297 --> 36:09.800
An ocean.
I think he was near an ocean.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.369
There you go.

36:11.402 --> 36:15.340
And there was, um, a ringing
like, like a clang.

36:15.373 --> 36:16.942
Clang.

36:16.974 --> 36:20.545
With a sound before it.
Um...

36:20.579 --> 36:23.248
Thud.
Clang.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.550
Thud! Clang!

36:25.583 --> 36:27.652
Okay, gimme a minute.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.586
Thud!

36:28.619 --> 36:31.590
Clang!
Yeah, Marty, I got it.
Thud, clang.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.958
Lemme think.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.597
thud!

36:39.630 --> 36:40.798
clang!

36:40.831 --> 36:42.833
Thud, clang!
(Monk)
Okay.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.335
Oh, my God, she's here,
she's here.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.336
Okay, Marty.
She's here!

36:45.371 --> 36:46.605
Mom! Mom!

36:46.637 --> 36:47.806
No, Marty, don't--

36:47.838 --> 36:51.277
Don't get separated!
You stay with the group!

36:51.309 --> 36:53.612
Marty, I want you
to focus.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.313
Can you focus?

36:55.347 --> 36:58.384
All right, the caller said
that she would be dead

36:58.416 --> 36:59.784
by--by--by 8:20, was it?

36:59.818 --> 37:00.786
(Natalie)
Why 8:20?

37:00.818 --> 37:01.786
Why not 8:00

37:01.820 --> 37:03.554
or 8:30?

37:03.588 --> 37:04.956
8:20.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.425
Think!

37:06.458 --> 37:07.425
I'm thinking.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.393
Well, think harder.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.561
Why don't you think?

37:09.594 --> 37:11.829
Hey, I'm not the great big
famous detective.

37:11.862 --> 37:13.364
Well, you were
two hours ago.
Natalie!

37:13.398 --> 37:15.634
What?

37:15.666 --> 37:17.034
8:20.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.405
What's 8:20?

37:19.438 --> 37:21.773
High tide.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.661
(Marty)
Mom!

37:42.693 --> 37:45.030
Mom! Mom!

37:45.063 --> 37:46.364
That's gotta be it.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.032
(Natalie)
Go, Marty, go!

37:48.065 --> 37:49.768
Mom! Mom! Mom!

37:51.436 --> 37:53.070
(Monk)
I'll wait out here!

37:53.103 --> 37:55.507
I got your back!

37:55.541 --> 37:57.775
Mom!

37:57.809 --> 38:00.512
Mom!

38:00.545 --> 38:03.014
Mom! Mom!

38:03.047 --> 38:04.615
We're trying, Mrs. Eels!

38:04.650 --> 38:06.083
[grunting]

38:06.117 --> 38:09.487
Push!

38:09.521 --> 38:10.956
[muffled cries]

38:10.989 --> 38:11.956
Mom!

38:11.989 --> 38:13.458
Oh, my God! Hurry!

38:20.965 --> 38:22.333
Marty, untie her!

38:22.367 --> 38:23.335
You gotta untie her!

38:23.369 --> 38:24.369
Oh! All right!

38:25.403 --> 38:28.606
Hurry! Hurry!

38:28.639 --> 38:30.074
Hold on, Mrs. Eels.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.443
[shouting and grunting]

38:31.476 --> 38:34.346
Okay, Marty, you gotta hurry!

39:18.690 --> 39:20.125
(Stottlemeyer)
Blanchard! Hands up.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.159
Let's go.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.561
Police officer!
Police officers!

39:22.594 --> 39:23.961
Mr. Blanchard,

39:23.994 --> 39:27.398
you're under arrest for
the murder of Harold Gumbal.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.134
Come on, come on.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.367
Let's go.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.775
thud, clang!

39:37.809 --> 39:39.545
Great, thank you.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.146
They got him.
It's over.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.648
That's good.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.184
Mrs. Eels, you're probably
going to have

39:46.217 --> 39:48.954
to testify about
that phone call you overheard.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.159
You told him.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.762
I didn't tell him.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.431
He figured it out.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.666
He's a real detective.

40:00.699 --> 40:06.804
Actually, he found you.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.539
We had no idea

40:08.574 --> 40:09.675
where you were.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.909
He put all
the clues together.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.713
thud, clang!

40:14.746 --> 40:16.547
He, um...

40:16.581 --> 40:20.719
It really was some of the most
unique detective work

40:20.751 --> 40:22.920
I've ever seen.
(Natalie)
Just an incredible detective.

40:22.954 --> 40:27.693
I mean,
his detecting is like--
What?

40:27.726 --> 40:29.527
He doesn't need anyone's help,
Mrs. Eels.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.496
No. No one's help.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.199
Really?

40:34.231 --> 40:38.737
When the kidnapper called,
they both panicked.

40:38.769 --> 40:42.773
I-I-I'm prone to panicking.

40:42.807 --> 40:45.210
And--and I had to say
let's get focused!

40:45.242 --> 40:47.077
Because my mother's
in trouble.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.014
And--and that got
everybody focused.

40:50.047 --> 40:52.617
But--but then I had to--
I had to concentrate

40:52.650 --> 40:54.052
on sounds
from the background.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.253
I could hear the ocean.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.588
And--and I heard

40:56.621 --> 40:58.188
a clang and a thud.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.123
A thud and a clang.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.025
And a thud and a clang.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.628
And--and--and 8:20--

41:02.661 --> 41:05.496
That's what struck me,
'cause I thought why not 8:00?

41:05.530 --> 41:06.764
Why not 8:30?

41:06.797 --> 41:10.101
And then I remembered
high tide is at 8:20.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.170
Once I--once I had that piece,
then it all fell together.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.173
Oh, Marty.
Marty, you're wonderful.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.012
I'd like to thank, uh,
the police department,

41:21.045 --> 41:23.981
particularly
Captain Stottlemeyer

41:24.014 --> 41:26.251
and, uh, Adrian Monk.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.519
This was a very difficult
case for me.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.889
Uh, last night I--
I made a decision, uh...

41:31.922 --> 41:34.059
It's--it's the toughest decision
of my career,

41:34.092 --> 41:36.961
but I am going to, um, resign

41:36.994 --> 41:40.030
my practice, and, uh,
take a teaching position

41:40.065 --> 41:43.802
at Fulton Community College,
uh, where I'll be teaching

41:43.835 --> 41:46.871
modern criminal
investigative techniques.

41:46.905 --> 41:50.909
You were right about him,
weren't you?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.710
He was cheating.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.048
Sorry.
Dropped the key.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.085
He was cheating.

42:06.224 --> 42:09.226
