<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:05.772 --> 00:09.109

<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.142 --> 00:12.112

00:12.145 --> 00:15.682

<i>* It's all right</i>

01:16.443 --> 01:17.944
Hey, preppy.
How's it going?

01:17.977 --> 01:19.279
Yeah, are you okay?

01:19.312 --> 01:21.348
He'll be fine.
Just leave him alone.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.382
What's the big deal?

01:22.415 --> 01:23.650
Am I supposed to be upset
about something?

01:23.683 --> 01:24.751
Well, yeah, I mean,

01:24.784 --> 01:26.086
after Kelly dumped you
the other night,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.822
I'm surprised you even
got out of bed.

01:28.855 --> 01:31.391
Well, maybe you'll meet somebody
at my Sweet Sixteen party.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.460
Now, remember, you guys,
it's this Saturday.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.961
Only five shopping days
left.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.131
Sounds excellent.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.734
Well, here's your invitation...

01:40.767 --> 01:42.135
and yours...

01:42.168 --> 01:43.703
and yours.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.106
Well, don't I get one?

01:46.106 --> 01:49.175
Well, okay, but if you have
a previous engagement,

01:49.209 --> 01:50.310
I understand.

01:50.343 --> 01:53.546
In fact, I'll pay for it.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.848
See you guys later.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.887
You know, Zack,
like my Uncle
Charlie used to say,

02:00.920 --> 02:04.324
"Women are like vines.
If you fall off one,

02:04.357 --> 02:06.526
"hey, you can swing
with another."

02:09.062 --> 02:11.965
You know,
you're not just a pig,
you are a gorilla-pig.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.735
Zack, you'll be all right.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.139
Hey,
Kelly is just another chick,
and now she's out of my life.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.373
Yeah.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.212
But not out of your locker.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.953
Hey, Kelly.
Hey.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.622
Here's an invitation
to my party.
Thanks.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.224
And here's a list of all
my favorite
stores in the mall.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.995
Great.
This will be a great chance

02:42.095 --> 02:43.396
for you guys to
get to know Jeff.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.365
Jeff?

02:45.398 --> 02:47.200
It's okay if I bring him,
isn't it?

02:48.968 --> 02:51.271
I guess so. I mean, I hadn't
really thought about it,

02:51.304 --> 02:53.640
but yeah, sure,
go ahead.
Thanks.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.109
She doesn't even care
about what she did to Zack.

02:56.142 --> 03:00.046
Yeah, now she
expects us to hang out with
that frat-boy babe stealer.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.882
Hi, guys.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.084
Hi, Kel. How's it going?

03:04.684 --> 03:07.053
( bell rings )

03:11.358 --> 03:13.193
There she is.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.595
Hey, I can handle this.
She's nobody special.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.497
I can't let her know
I'm miserable.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.073
( clearing throat )

03:27.774 --> 03:29.242
Hi, Zack.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.511
Oh, hey, Kelly.
How you doing? Nice jacket.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.182
Good morning, class.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.351
All:
Good morning, Miss Simpson.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.286
I said
"Good morning, class."

03:40.320 --> 03:42.389
Didn't your parents
teach you any manners?

03:43.923 --> 03:46.126
Miss Simpson, I have
a doctor's appointment today.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.094
May I leave class early?

03:48.094 --> 03:50.230
Yes, your hair is curly.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.867
Now, let's get started.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.403
Today, we turn
to the romantic poems

03:56.436 --> 03:59.105
of Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

04:00.073 --> 04:05.145
So, let's have Bayside's
most loved couple

04:05.178 --> 04:06.880
recite a poem for us.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.415
Zack and Kelly, if you please.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.216
( all exclaiming )

04:11.918 --> 04:15.955
No! No. Well, I mean,
let's me and
Slater read it instead.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.957
Oh, Ms. Spano.
Don't be such a ham.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.461
Here we are.
Begin when ready.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.867
( rapidly )
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.968
"I love thee to the depth
and breadth..."

04:29.069 --> 04:32.205
Mr. Morris!
This is a love poem.

04:32.238 --> 04:35.241
This time recite it slower
and with feeling.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.346
( nervous laugh )

04:39.379 --> 04:42.182
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.351
"I love thee to the depth..."

04:44.384 --> 04:47.120
And I love thee to stop!
I can't take it anymore!

04:48.321 --> 04:50.323
( whining )

04:52.592 --> 04:55.161
Well, it certainly moved
Mr. Screech.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.500
( all chuckling )

05:00.533 --> 05:02.769
Hey, Screech...
Tell me about the time

05:02.802 --> 05:04.938
when Zack made Mr. Belding
think he was going crazy.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.039
It was great.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.274
He rigged his office
so that every 15 minutes

05:08.308 --> 05:10.910
his desk would shake
and his pictures would rattle.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.580
You did that?

05:13.613 --> 05:15.782
Then Mr. Belding's running
in and out of
his office all day

05:15.815 --> 05:17.917
screaming, "Earthquake!"

05:17.951 --> 05:19.552
You should have
been there, Slater.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.954
He got so whacked out,
he called Caltech

05:21.054 --> 05:22.055
and tried to convince them

05:22.055 --> 05:24.691
there was a fault line
underneath his desk.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.559
I'll bet. That's beautiful.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.661
Hey, Zack, you are an artiste.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.130
You think so?
Definitely. Yeah.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.099
( movie music playing )

05:37.070 --> 05:38.938
I'm glad we came, guys.
It was a good idea.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.917
Psst, Slater?
What?

05:52.986 --> 05:54.087
Slater!

05:54.087 --> 05:56.089
Hey, shut up, man.
I'm trying to watch the movie.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.724
Yeah, shut up, Screech.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.031
( low )
"Eff-Jay and elly-Kay."

06:09.035 --> 06:12.706
"On't-day, et-lay,
ack-Zay, ee-say."

06:12.739 --> 06:14.607
What-ay?
Oy vey.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.077
What's going on?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.912
Screech is starting
to feel real sick.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.946
I am? Oh yeah.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.048
Oh, my pancreas!

06:22.082 --> 06:23.717
All: Shh!

06:24.951 --> 06:26.953
( tires screeching )

06:27.053 --> 06:28.955
( gunshots, woman screams )

06:29.055 --> 06:30.757
( squeals ) Oh, no!

06:35.095 --> 06:36.863
I'm outta here.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.308
When I was four years old,
my father promised me

06:48.341 --> 06:51.277
anything I wanted for my
Sweet Sixteen birthday party.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.612
So?

06:52.645 --> 06:54.080
So, he let me down.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.082
Well, what do you want?
MC Hammer.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.021
Lisa, aren't you
overdoing it a bit?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.822
Girl, I turn 16 once.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.358
It's gonna be the social event
of the season.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.460
Oh, do you want me
to jump out of the cake, babe?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.265
No, I'd like you to jump
into the cake
while it's baking.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.135
What's up, guys?

07:15.168 --> 07:18.905
Lisa, about your party,
I just can't make it.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.274
What are you talking about?
Everybody's gonna be there.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.943
That's the problem.
Kelly will be there too.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.945
Of course she is.
She's coming with...

07:26.913 --> 07:28.281
Oh!

07:28.314 --> 07:30.183
( together ) Oh!

07:30.450 --> 07:32.185
Yeah, Oh!

07:32.218 --> 07:33.620
Sorry, Lisa.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.423
Zack, what happened?
You were doing fine yesterday.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.092
Sure, right up until
I caught them at the movies.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.927
People go to the movies
all the time.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.595
Yeah, but most people
come up for air.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.398
( mimics kissing )

07:45.432 --> 07:47.233
Hi, guys.
Hi, Zack.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.203
Bye, guys.
( Screech grumbles )

07:52.372 --> 07:53.973
What's wrong with him?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.275
As if you didn't know.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.877
Why are you
ruining Zack's life?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.346
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.348
Zack was
at the movies last night.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.216
People go to the movies
all the time.

08:03.249 --> 08:06.853
But not all of them make out
in front of
their ex-boyfriends.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.923
We were not making out.
We were just cuddling.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.026
You know, Kelly, I'd hoped
you'd be
a little more sensitive.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.161
At least you've
got somebody.
Yeah.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.429
What am I supposed to do?

08:16.463 --> 08:18.398
Call ahead
before I go anyplace
to see if Zack's there?

08:18.431 --> 08:21.234
Both: Yes.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.170
You're the one who told me
to be honest
with him about Jeff.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.372
Now you're
telling me to hide it?

08:25.405 --> 08:27.040
Both: Yes!

08:28.174 --> 08:29.309
If you two are
sharing a brain,

08:29.342 --> 08:30.944
why don't you
get one that works?

08:34.614 --> 08:37.183
I've got to keep
my mind off of Kelly.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.419
So I'm going to do something
I've never done before...

08:40.419 --> 08:42.054
...homework.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.894
Bad idea.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.196
I know.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.065
Television.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.900
Announcer: <i>Next on</i>
Married with Children,

08:53.933 --> 08:57.070
<i>Kelly dumps her boyfriend</i>
<i>for a French fry chef.</i>

09:00.907 --> 09:04.277
Too much television
is bad for you anyway.

09:04.310 --> 09:08.014
Radio announcer: <i>Next time</i>
<i>your secretary leaves</i>
<i>you hanging, call us.</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:09.482
<i>We're the Kelly Girls.</i>

09:14.421 --> 09:16.022
Gosh.
( knocking on door )

09:16.022 --> 09:18.158
Please, just go away.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.060
Hey, Zack.
We came to cheer you up.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.796
Listen, guys, I have to work
this out on my own.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.031
Zack, you're Bayside's
most eligible bachelor.

09:25.031 --> 09:28.034
I've got a list
a mile long with girls
who want to go out with you.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.470
Maybe I don't want to go out
with anyone, all right?

09:30.503 --> 09:34.040
Look, Preppie, you can't spend
the rest of your
life in your room.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.343
Well, I don't know, Slater.
It's a pretty nice room.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.046
Zack,
you don't see Kelly sitting

09:40.046 --> 09:41.715
around being depressed,
do you?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.183
Oh, cheer me right up.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.085
Face it. It's over.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.156
Maybe you're right.
If Kelly doesn't care,
why should I, right?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.125
Slater: Right.
Bring on the babes.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.828
Great. I know this girl who
would love to go out with you.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.196
Her name's Sue
and besides being

09:56.229 --> 09:57.597
<i>pretty,</i>
<i>she's got a great mind.</i>

09:57.630 --> 10:00.700
<i>And she loves to read</i>
<i>so she's got a lot to say.</i>

10:00.734 --> 10:02.168
Like, I figured Danielle Steel

10:02.202 --> 10:04.671
must be writing all
of Jackie Collins'
romance novels

10:04.704 --> 10:06.239
because, like,
they're all the same.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.742
Well, not exactly the same.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.176
I mean, they have to be,
like, a little bit different

10:10.210 --> 10:11.778
or everybody would know.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.646
( tires screeching, gunshots )

10:13.680 --> 10:15.615
( woman screams )

10:15.648 --> 10:17.083
Have you read
<i>Hollywood Wives?</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:20.120
Jessie: <i>You have got</i>
<i>to go out with Cassie.</i>

10:20.153 --> 10:24.124
She's got a great personality
and an insatiable
hunger for life.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.964
You know, after the movie,
we should go to Antonio's.

10:30.997 --> 10:35.268
I have this
craving for a big bowl
of spaghetti and meatballs.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.806
( gunshots,
woman screams )

10:39.839 --> 10:41.908
( gasps )
I'm out of popcorn!

10:44.878 --> 10:46.513
Screech: <i>You never met</i>
<i>my cousin Kimberly, did you?</i>

10:46.546 --> 10:49.616
A lot of guys
think she's cute,
if you like that long-legged,

10:49.649 --> 10:51.618
<i>gorgeous,</i>
<i>blonde ballerina type.</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:54.688
Oh, he's so mean.
I hope they catch him.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.990
( tires screeching,
gunshots )

10:57.023 --> 10:58.391
( woman screams )

10:58.425 --> 11:00.727
Oh, no!

11:00.760 --> 11:02.829
Kim, how would you feel
about a burger
after the movie?

11:02.862 --> 11:04.931
I know a great place
where we can go.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.945
Kelly, are you gonna
get that table tonight,

11:18.978 --> 11:21.081
or were you waiting
to serve them breakfast?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.750
Let 'em starve.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.085
Why don't you make up
with your friends?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.354
You're acting like a bunch
of high school kids.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.222
We are a bunch
of high school kids, okay?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.992
You've known them a lot longer
than you've known me.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.728
Come on.
Go over and straighten

11:34.761 --> 11:36.196
this out and
you'll all feel better.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.833
Maybe you're right.
Okay.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.707
Hi, guys.
How ya doin'?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.709
Slater: Okay. I'll have
a double cheeseburger.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.811
Girls: Cheeseburger.
Do you have any specials?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.581
Cheeseburger.
How's Zack doing?

11:54.614 --> 11:57.117
See? You guys are wrong.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.752
She does remember his name.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.656
Well, this is the place.
Hey, look who's here.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.260
Kimberly, I want you to meet
some of my friends.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.596
This is Jessie,
this is Slater,

12:09.629 --> 12:11.931
this is Lisa,
and you know Screech.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.834
Hey, cuz. Missed you
at Aunt
Gertrude's birthday party.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.070
We played "Pin the Tail
on Uncle Fred" again.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.773
Hi, Zack.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.307
Oh, hi. I'm glad you're here.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.209
Can you get us a table?
Something really romantic.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.682
Yeah, sure.
Right this way.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.083
See you guys later.

12:32.318 --> 12:35.822
Wow! Look at him.
He's really happy.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.826
How could you
be related to her?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.631
Well, she's adopted.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.899
Slater: Oh, that makes sense.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.536
Come on, Zack. Let me order.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.970
Let's split a milkshake.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.943
One chocolate milkshake
with two straws.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.714
Would you like to dance?

13:00.747 --> 13:02.615
I'd love to.
All right.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.154
( romantic
instrumental music playing )

13:14.127 --> 13:16.062
Whoa!

13:16.062 --> 13:19.132
That's A-12...
Zack and Kelly's song.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.069
Why would he do that?
That's so cruel.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.638
To get even with her.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.308
What a creep.
Kelly does not deserve that.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.610
She didn't deserve
to be snubbed by us either.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.878
Right.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.787
Excuse me, Zack.
Can we talk?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.357
This will only take
one second.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.334
So, what's up, Kimber...
Oh, I'm sorry, Kelly.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.672
Zack, this is our song, A-12.
It's sacred.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.775
No, no, no.
A-12 was sacred.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.044
Right up until you
dumped me for that jerk.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.312
Don't you dare
call him a jerk.
You don't even know Jeff.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.481
Right now,
the only jerk I see is you.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.454
My gosh, can you believe her?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.456
I told her I wanted
a strawberry shake instead

14:16.489 --> 14:18.591
and she gets all upset.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.460
I heard every word, you creep.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.762
How dare you
use me to get back
at your old girlfriend?

14:22.796 --> 14:25.065
No, no, wa...ugh!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.144
Kelly...

14:38.178 --> 14:40.480
I'm really sorry about the way
I've been treating you.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.283
Yeah, me too.
I've been narrow-minded,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.352
judgmental
and pigheaded.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.653
You were
just being yourself.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.890
I deserved that.
I did.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.126
Kelly, can you
ever forgive us?

14:53.159 --> 14:55.695
Just don't make it a habit.
Now give me a hug.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.364
Lisa: Thank you.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.665
Uh, I'll see you guys later.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.068
Oh, rats! Is Kelly gone?

15:02.102 --> 15:04.037
Cut it out, Zack.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.573
After what she did,
I can't believe you're
still talking to her.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.476
That's not fair. Don't make us
choose between you and Kelly.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.777
Yeah.
You're way out of line.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.446
She wasn't out of line
when she smacked me?

15:13.480 --> 15:16.449
If I were Kelly,
you'd still be pulling a
hairbrush out of your ear.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.550
Don't get me started.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.056
It was your fault for bringing
your date there.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.392
You're the ones
who convinced
me to date again.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.861
Jessie: But we didn't tell you
to rub Kelly's face in it.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.763
You really hurt
her and you did it

15:29.796 --> 15:31.865
on purpose.
That really stinks.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.601
I hope you'll be
more mature at my party.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.871
The only way I'll
come to your party is if
you disinvite Kelly.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.274
That's it.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.377
Look, Kelly is my friend too,
and she's gonna
be at my party.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.680
If you can't accept that,
then don't come.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.318
That's fine.
Then I won't go.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.753
( slams )

15:55.689 --> 15:58.425
Take back your jacket,
your sweater,

15:58.458 --> 16:02.328
your lucky pom-poms,
and your stupid volleyball...

16:02.362 --> 16:06.366
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! What is going on, here?

16:06.399 --> 16:09.602
Zack,
this is not your bedroom.
Clean this mess up.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.739
Why don't you
clean it yourself?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.677
My office.
Now.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.749
( knocking on door )

16:24.617 --> 16:27.554
Come on, Zack. We don't want
to be late for Lisa's party.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.657
I'm not going.
Here,
give this to Lisa for me.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.927
Let's go. Get dressed and you
can give it to her yourself.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.696
I said I am not going.
Do you have an earwax buildup?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.866
But it's gonna be a blast.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.469
There's even gonna be
a Jell-O mold of
Michael Jackson.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.606
If we jiggle it,
it'll moonwalk
across the potato salad.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.409
Thanks, Screech.
But after the way
I've been acting,

16:49.442 --> 16:52.178
you're probably the only one
that wants me there.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.480
You think we're
gonna stop being

16:53.513 --> 16:55.715
your friend
because you messed up?

16:55.749 --> 16:57.884
Well...
You mess up all the time.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.386
It's what you do best.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.189
But this time
I really acted like an idiot.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.525
If you can't be an idiot
with your friends,

17:05.558 --> 17:07.527
who can you
be an idiot with?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.429
Come on, let's go party.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.065
I don't think so.
Not this time.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.501
Well, okay,
but you're being an idiot.

17:17.871 --> 17:21.107
Remember, it's better to be
dumped by
the best-looking girl

17:21.141 --> 17:22.942
than to have never
been dumped at all.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.249
( dance music plays )

17:35.155 --> 17:37.057
( doorbell rings )

17:40.193 --> 17:41.227
Hey, Lisa.
Hi.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.096
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.499
A mini-skirt!
Thanks.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.504
Hey, Lisa. Happy Birthday.
Thanks.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.176
Wow! A charm bracelet!
Thanks!

18:01.081 --> 18:03.083
Happy birthday, Lisa.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.251
I poked holes in it
so he can breathe.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.327
Is Zack coming?

18:14.361 --> 18:16.162
Uh, no. He stayed home.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.265
That's probably safer,
'cause Kelly's bringing Jeff.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.167
Did he send a present?
Yup.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.104
But my present ate it.
I'm sorry.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.381
( doorbell rings )

18:38.618 --> 18:40.620
Happy Sweet Sixteen, Lisa.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.124
Oh, I wasn't expecting
earrings, Kelly, thank you.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.932
Hi, we haven't been formally
introduced.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.401
I'm Lisa Turtle.
Hi, Jeff Hunter.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.202
Thanks for inviting me.
Sure.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.205
Well, we're gonna go say hi
to everybody. Bye.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.308
Hi, guys.
You all know Jeff.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.880
So, Slater, Kelly
tells me you wrestle.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.214
Yeah.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.916
I used to
wrestle in high school.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.251
Were you any good?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.253
Won my division a few times.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.022
Really?
We should talk.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.323
All right.
All right then.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.859
Jeff, when I first found out
about you and Kelly,

19:19.893 --> 19:21.861
I didn't want
to give you a chance,

19:21.895 --> 19:24.898
but if you're
good enough for her,
you're good enough for me.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.266
Hey, thank you.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.436
All right, Jeff.
We'll talk...

19:33.106 --> 19:35.141
Well, even though
I'm supposed to hate you

19:35.175 --> 19:37.210
'cause you stole
my best friend's woman,

19:37.243 --> 19:40.613
I guess you're not
a sleaze ball after all.

19:40.647 --> 19:44.050
Thanks, Screech.
I'm gonna go get some punch.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.124
Lisa, where's Zack?

19:51.157 --> 19:52.425
He's not coming.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.061
I never meant
to hurt him.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.163
We know, Kelly.
He'll get over it.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.898
I hope so.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.303
<i>* Jessie:</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

20:03.336 --> 20:06.306
<i>* All: Happy birthday to you</i>

20:06.339 --> 20:09.609
<i>* Happy birthday,</i>
<i>dear Lisa</i>

20:09.642 --> 20:12.345
<i>* Happy birthday to you *</i>

20:12.379 --> 20:14.180
( applause )

20:19.886 --> 20:23.223
One more time!
Happy birthday to...

20:24.457 --> 20:27.327
Sorry I'm late, Lisa.
Happy birthday.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.996
Thanks, Zack. I wasn't
even expecting you.

20:30.030 --> 20:33.166
A good friend convinced me
I was being an idiot.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.036
Excuse me, I have to go
settle something.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.140
Please don't mess up
my party.

20:40.874 --> 20:43.043
Hi, Zack.
Hi.

20:44.844 --> 20:49.783
Look... I'm sorry for the way
I treated you.

20:49.816 --> 20:53.019
I was more hurt than I thought
and didn't know
how to deal with it.

20:53.053 --> 20:54.954
I noticed.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.857
You are a very hard girl
to get over, Kelly.

20:57.891 --> 20:59.959
But I'd rather
have you as a friend
than not have you at all.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.162
Oh, Zack.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.436
Hey, congratulations, Jeff.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.205
You got a great girl.
Treat her right.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.973
Hey, you got it, man.

21:19.079 --> 21:21.181
One of the hardest things
about being a teenager

21:21.214 --> 21:23.283
is losing your first love.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.919
I don't know if I'll ever
get over Kelly.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.322
Excuse me. Do you believe
in love at first sight?

21:35.095 --> 21:36.830
On the other hand,
I absolutely

21:36.863 --> 21:38.331
believe in love
at first sight.
