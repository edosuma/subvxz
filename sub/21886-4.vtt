it makes these, um--

00:08.642 --> 00:10.444

other memories.

I don't already know.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.381
'Cause you're not really him.

You said so yourself.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.358
I'm the better version of you.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.060
What happens
to these cannibals

00:26.094 --> 00:28.429
when they run out
of memories to eat?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.499
- My husband will be home soon.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.167
- I'm your husband.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.368
But if I can just
get her back to reality,

00:34.402 --> 00:35.503
I think it'll come back to her.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.171
- We went back.
The house is gone.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.539

where it's hiding.

in an alternate reality?

00:53.354 --> 00:55.189
- You know, I'd try to give you
a high five,

00:55.223 --> 00:57.325
but I feel like that'd probably
be a little weird.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.328
- I feel like we should avoid
the post-coital high five

01:00.361 --> 01:01.462
as best we can.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.663

01:08.902 --> 01:12.206
this usually takes
a couple dates first.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.410

They know we're leaving

I guess that's what happens when
the host runs out of memories.
