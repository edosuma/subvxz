01:16.831 --> 01:18.041
They say,

01:19.691 --> 01:22.171
when you hear the sounds of devils,

01:26.831 --> 01:28.661
all else is quiet.

01:50.011 --> 01:51.946
My general question to that is:

01:51.981 --> 01:54.491
How do you know if what you are hearing

01:56.261 --> 01:58.601
is the work of such devious beings?

02:10.561 --> 02:14.411
I would venture to say that
most devilish noises occur,

02:15.851 --> 02:17.706
when large numbers of men decide

02:17.741 --> 02:21.581
to force the hand of mortality
upon one another.

02:23.381 --> 02:24.851
And I'd say futher,

02:26.201 --> 02:27.821
that on such occasions,

02:28.491 --> 02:30.381
there is not just one sound,

02:33.661 --> 02:34.811
but many.

02:41.731 --> 02:44.431
It is a quiet orchestra of death.

03:05.751 --> 03:09.541
It is also possible that the man
who wrote that saying

03:14.801 --> 03:16.881
might've just had some broken ears.

03:29.081 --> 03:32.881
I have been moved from one wipe out
regimen to the next.

03:33.941 --> 03:36.851
Witnessing countless moral felonies.

03:38.011 --> 03:41.631
I met General McClain in
the last summer of the war,

03:43.311 --> 03:44.701
peculiar man.

03:58.091 --> 03:59.451
Captain Lee Briggs.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.661
Sir?

04:01.431 --> 04:03.261
Man of nine lives.

04:09.851 --> 04:12.851
Have you any idea of how
many divisions have us pinned here?

04:13.571 --> 04:14.231
No sir.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.971
Let's just say,
enough to make fate unfavorable.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.651
I've got a job for you Briggs.

04:24.341 --> 04:27.561
It's recently come
to my attention that an object

04:27.901 --> 04:31.501
of grandest design has been
discovered east of the Colorado basin.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.911
Given the undeniable truth

04:33.931 --> 04:36.551
that we here are on a collision
course with destiny.

04:39.491 --> 04:43.481
Neither I nor my men will be able
to get witness to this object.

04:44.661 --> 04:45.951
Someone ought to see it.

04:47.481 --> 04:49.601
I reckon it should be you.

04:51.531 --> 04:54.381
The sole survivor of the 22nd Connecticut.

05:06.751 --> 05:09.451
Even one man alive is homage to the rest.

05:09.801 --> 05:11.731
Make regular notes of your journey Briggs.

05:18.411 --> 05:20.041
To be given a pass

05:21.111 --> 05:22.941
to watch all others go,

05:25.011 --> 05:27.831
is perhaps the most
troubling thing to one's being.

06:04.941 --> 06:06.861
Sometimes when I wake up,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.481
I feel like I'm still sleeping.

06:10.961 --> 06:14.041
I feel like all the colours
and shapes of the world

06:14.331 --> 06:15.296
have collided,

06:15.331 --> 06:18.681
and all I can do
is just sit there and watch.

06:21.401 --> 06:26.101
I think a person heart as a way
of turning off when it can't find reason.

06:28.361 --> 06:33.051
I guess that's why nature
has always had an inspiring presence.

06:34.111 --> 06:36.131
Everything follows a purpose.

06:40.861 --> 06:43.091
I guess we're missing something.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.091
Why do we struggle

06:46.831 --> 06:48.801
to breathe a more righteous breath,

06:50.201 --> 06:52.741
when we all end up in the same place?

06:58.961 --> 07:00.231
I'd like to hope

07:01.181 --> 07:03.711
that our history is worth remembering.

07:04.231 --> 07:07.001
An imprint of careful design,

07:08.181 --> 07:10.011
a feeling of heartfelt purpose.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.201
And a sense of hope

07:14.151 --> 07:16.021
for something bigger than ourselves.

07:18.511 --> 07:19.121
And,

07:20.261 --> 07:21.851
maybe I'll wake up.

08:25.501 --> 08:28.761
ISS module, 32 Delta, this is Cambridge,

08:28.796 --> 08:31.001
do you have a fix on us, over.

08:31.151 --> 08:33.851
Copy that, this is 32 Delta,
I've got you.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.780
Alpha Bravo, we are linking a satcom.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.991
Now, wait for transmissions to follow.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.441
Copy that.

08:41.711 --> 08:46.441
That is 89 43.23

08:46.601 --> 08:53.551
followed by 32.35.12.67

08:53.921 --> 08:57.901
follow it 21.01

08:58.711 --> 09:01.551
ISS your satcom link is now active.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.551
Houston you have line operation.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.551
Roger that,
thank you Cambridge.

09:06.751 --> 09:08.231
How are you up there?

09:08.431 --> 09:10.211
I'm doing fine,
how are you?

09:10.401 --> 09:11.791
We all doing well.

09:11.881 --> 09:14.041
We've been monitoring your vital signs.

09:14.411 --> 09:15.791
Very pleased with the results.

09:15.981 --> 09:18.051
How are you feeling now that you
have been able to settle in?

09:18.121 --> 09:18.731
Good!

09:19.601 --> 09:22.101
Station is in pretty decent shape.

09:22.461 --> 09:27.081
The only device that seems
really out of whack is the RS7 pomp.

09:27.861 --> 09:30.441
It seems to be operating
in half pressure.

09:30.711 --> 09:33.461
Don't worry we will add it
to the repair sheet.

09:33.781 --> 09:38.491
Well for the sake of futur
ISS inhabitants I strongly recommand it.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.761
Do you receiving the data package?

09:41.101 --> 09:42.631
Yeah, I just started.

09:44.101 --> 09:46.761
Houston this thing ain't opening,
do you want to resend it?

09:47.231 --> 09:49.211
No why don't you give the audio a try?

09:49.551 --> 09:51.131
Alright one moment.

09:52.961 --> 09:55.321
<i>Captain Lee Miller!</i>

09:55.361 --> 09:57.741
We've recorded this the other night.

09:57.776 --> 09:58.446
My God.

09:58.481 --> 10:01.101
<i>We haven't been in space
in almost 20 years now, right?</i>

10:01.111 --> 10:04.161
<i>I gotta say I feel so
honored and thankful...</i>

10:04.181 --> 10:04.891
I sound terrible.

10:04.911 --> 10:08.251
<i>to be one of the first
to be going back after so long.</i>

10:08.331 --> 10:10.281
I'll make sure the guys
get the visual for you.

10:10.311 --> 10:11.576
<i>I'm a little nervous, but...</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:16.031
We have a com link test down here at
23:00 so back to you in the morning.

10:16.061 --> 10:17.411
Alright you guys have a good night.

10:17.461 --> 10:18.701
Likewise.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.421
Houston to Cambridge, out.

11:30.831 --> 11:34.376
<i>Troops with armored vehicles,
machine guns,</i>

11:34.411 --> 11:38.831
didn't feel comfortable going to that
area, in the aftermath of the bombing.

11:55.851 --> 11:59.711
ISS module this is 23 alpha into
Cambridge, how do you read, over?

12:06.951 --> 12:10.961
ISS module this is 23 alpha into
Cambridge, how do you read, over?

12:12.611 --> 12:14.231
Copy that, this is ISS.

12:14.931 --> 12:16.651
ISS, this is 23 alpha.

12:17.081 --> 12:19.591
Can you transmit your
orbital bearing numbers?

12:19.611 --> 12:21.271
We are doing a quick line up test.

12:22.351 --> 12:22.851
OK

12:23.401 --> 12:26.131
Give us 8 packets,
we will figure the constant.

12:26.151 --> 12:28.081
8 packets, is a hell of a projection.

12:28.561 --> 12:29.161
Yeah,

12:29.251 --> 12:33.051
well they want to see if the ISS will
stay in orbit without remote positioning.

12:34.031 --> 12:35.431
Copy that,
did you receive them?

12:36.761 --> 12:38.451
Looks like it, thanks.

12:39.601 --> 12:40.781
How are you holding up?

12:41.721 --> 12:42.361
Good!

12:43.161 --> 12:43.616
Good.

12:43.651 --> 12:45.891
Well,
I don't want to keep you.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.211
23 alpha out.

12:48.261 --> 12:49.291
Godspeed Lee.

12:53.151 --> 12:54.761
Godspeed to you too.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.841
ISS 32 this is mission control,
Cambridge.

14:57.561 --> 14:59.211
Did you receive our data package.

15:00.051 --> 15:02.431
Copy that.
It's downloading right now.

15:03.211 --> 15:05.321
Did you guys rezip for the clip
of the Late Show.

15:05.551 --> 15:06.421
Negative.

15:06.561 --> 15:09.051
I believe the chef will
get that to you later.

15:09.651 --> 15:11.611
This is a recorded message
from your brother.

15:15.811 --> 15:16.311
Copy that.

15:16.411 --> 15:16.911
Cheers.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.771
Hey buddy,
I hope everything is going well up there.

15:19.941 --> 15:21.171
Thinking about you.

15:21.531 --> 15:24.741
But, the important news is
you are officially an uncle.

15:25.461 --> 15:26.591
You've got a nephew,

15:26.901 --> 15:30.241
and he is beautiful,
it's just incredible.

15:30.611 --> 15:33.491
But, he can't wait to meet you.

15:33.951 --> 15:36.591
I'm gonna try to send some
photos if I can figure out.

15:37.611 --> 15:39.821
It's so complicated to do
that with these guys.

15:40.221 --> 15:41.171
Anyway,

15:41.311 --> 15:43.211
take care of yourself please.

15:43.251 --> 15:45.071
I will talk to you soon, bye.

15:54.481 --> 15:56.411
Hey Houston, did you pick that up?

16:04.281 --> 16:07.301
Cambridge, have I been crossed over yet?

16:25.561 --> 16:30.431
Cambridge, this is ISS 37 did you guys
pick up that radio interference?

16:44.411 --> 16:46.851
That's a tough one.

16:47.861 --> 16:50.011
People need other people.

16:51.931 --> 16:53.921
That's why I really think I'm a storyteller,

16:54.061 --> 16:57.961
I will get into situations where

16:58.451 --> 17:00.621
my priority is I shouldn't
stick my nose in,

17:00.701 --> 17:01.531
but I do.

17:02.181 --> 17:03.451
Because I feel that...

17:04.981 --> 17:06.021
I've seen a lot,

17:06.031 --> 17:07.310
I've been through a lot.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.271
That's really my opinion,
that's the only way to really

17:10.310 --> 17:13.101
communicate in modern races
and the people of the world.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.340
If I can drop a word here or there
or a little tale here or there,

17:20.481 --> 17:22.751
that I think might help somebody.

17:23.701 --> 17:24.851
I'd drop it like a bomb.

17:26.381 --> 17:28.570
If something like that ever did happen,
where everybody stop talking

17:28.661 --> 17:31.351
everybody stop telling stories,
everybody stop relating.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.101
Nobody learns anything.

17:33.211 --> 17:34.481
No one does anything?

17:35.281 --> 17:37.431
I probably not even want
to think what it would be like.

17:37.861 --> 17:39.401
Maybe peaceful as hell.

17:44.001 --> 17:46.111
I think it would be a horrible world.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.961
MC this is ISS,
do you guys have a read on me?

18:33.751 --> 18:36.981
MC this is ISS,
do you copy?

19:07.951 --> 19:09.701
This is genius.

19:10.151 --> 19:13.691
Make a big radio with English buttons,
and then...

19:13.726 --> 19:16.041
write a manual for it in Russian!

19:21.471 --> 19:23.911
Houston this is ISS,
do you copy?

19:41.201 --> 19:44.161
Houston? Cambridge?
Do you copy?

20:15.031 --> 20:17.241
Cambridge this is ISS,
do you copy?

20:20.381 --> 20:22.711
Cambridge this is ISS,
do you copy?

20:29.381 --> 20:30.911
Hello Lee.

20:32.261 --> 20:34.431
Sorry I'm sending
this message as recording,

20:36.061 --> 20:37.446
but to be honest,

20:37.481 --> 20:39.511
it's the best I can do right now.

20:41.891 --> 20:42.651
So,

20:42.981 --> 20:45.931
I kind of dare that
I don't ever tell you this directly,

20:48.381 --> 20:51.211
but we had so shit
going on down here that I...

20:52.461 --> 20:54.851
I don't even know where to begin.

20:56.531 --> 20:58.531
Even if I wanted
to bring you out of orbit,

20:58.771 --> 21:01.381
I don't have the people to do it.

21:02.601 --> 21:04.931
Look, we're gonna need
you to sit tight for a while.

21:07.071 --> 21:08.241
I'm sorry.

21:11.251 --> 21:12.341
I'm sorry.

21:29.511 --> 21:31.711
I don't know what kind
of transmission that was,

21:31.801 --> 21:34.981
and unless I'm mistaken
we're nowhere near April.

21:35.201 --> 21:40.491
So I'm gonna need a confirmation of any
sort of mission extension from you assholes!

21:47.511 --> 21:49.266
Look, I don't think it's funny,

21:49.301 --> 21:52.011
and if you guys are doing
some type of stress experiments,

21:52.021 --> 21:54.601
or isolation test,

21:54.611 --> 21:56.531
well then you can stop now because...

21:56.681 --> 21:59.351
because I'm very isolated
and very stressed!

22:03.531 --> 22:07.631
If the line is open enough
for me to get a pre-recorded message

22:07.811 --> 22:09.216
then I know you can hear me

22:09.251 --> 22:10.771
and I would appreciate knowing...

22:10.781 --> 22:12.561
What the hell is going on?

22:21.351 --> 22:22.271
Houston?

22:25.861 --> 22:26.651
Cambridge?

22:26.731 --> 22:29.651
This is ISS,
do you copy?

25:29.131 --> 25:29.921
When...

25:31.201 --> 25:34.531
that interactivity is suddenly just cut,

25:35.991 --> 25:38.731
you're just left, standing by yourself,

25:39.691 --> 25:40.991
in the darkness.

25:41.901 --> 25:45.071
I didn't see that coming,
what was that all about?

25:46.461 --> 25:47.671
Where do I go from here?

25:49.681 --> 25:52.171
I think we control
our own surroundings...

26:00.681 --> 26:03.161
For the most part,
we control our own surroundings,

26:03.281 --> 26:05.241
we can decide to go here or there.

26:05.581 --> 26:07.871
But once we have established ourselves,

26:08.811 --> 26:09.601
I think that's when

26:11.361 --> 26:14.811
our environment starts
to take a toll on our personality,

26:15.781 --> 26:16.441
our habits,

26:17.601 --> 26:19.391
the way we think every day.

26:20.111 --> 26:23.531
We are social creatures
and we need to interact with people.

26:24.831 --> 26:28.071
that's why relationships are so...
important

26:28.091 --> 26:31.381
so crucial for existence.

26:33.121 --> 26:36.791
Because if you don't talk to anybody,
you don't interact with anybody,

26:38.861 --> 26:41.941
your all sense of reality
is pretty warped.

29:09.821 --> 29:12.221
Physical diagnostic check...

29:46.161 --> 29:49.601
lots of glass, plastic or metal.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.931
I should make a proper introduction
since I am the captain.

31:28.301 --> 31:29.831
My name is Lee.

31:39.711 --> 31:40.821
And you are?

31:46.451 --> 31:47.581
You're an astronaut.

31:48.261 --> 31:51.201
You're a polaroid I'm talking to.

31:57.311 --> 31:59.091
This place sucks.

34:09.831 --> 34:13.991
These guys have definitely
won a space trip in orbit.

34:19.411 --> 34:20.610
You on the other hand...

34:22.400 --> 34:27.440
well, if I was on your mission
we would definitely had some problems.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.931
God, I love you smile.

34:33.460 --> 34:37.541
How about this,
I get you to buy off this joint,

34:37.576 --> 34:38.561
get back home,

34:38.880 --> 34:40.101
take a shower,

34:40.661 --> 34:41.880
put on a suit,

34:42.571 --> 34:44.130
we head downtown,

34:44.161 --> 34:45.061
East Village

34:45.551 --> 34:47.541
great little Italian restaurant.

34:48.601 --> 34:53.751
But hell, what I'm making it up,
how about a nice Malibu sunset?

34:54.751 --> 34:55.701
It's the best...

34:56.951 --> 34:58.941
Malibu sunset.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.241
God...

35:34.501 --> 35:35.346
I gotta say

35:35.381 --> 35:38.841
I feel so honored and thankful to be...

35:45.431 --> 35:47.551
Who's idea was it
to try to make a shower?

35:47.781 --> 35:49.041
I want a shower.

35:57.501 --> 35:58.931
Three seconds on the shot clock...

36:00.351 --> 36:01.641
ball passed into play...

36:02.031 --> 36:03.301
goes to Miller...

36:05.161 --> 36:06.071
he shoots.

36:50.161 --> 36:51.411
Roll it.

36:55.161 --> 36:59.701
Hey buddy,
I hope everything is going well up there

37:00.631 --> 37:01.801
OK,

37:12.961 --> 37:14.851
where the hell is my fucking video.

37:20.201 --> 37:20.961
Fuck!

38:23.501 --> 38:25.511
Why am I funny?

39:07.511 --> 39:09.161
Where are you going?

39:12.401 --> 39:14.321
I've got to reroute some power.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.091
Why?

39:20.201 --> 39:21.341
Because...

39:23.611 --> 39:25.721
The station is broken.

39:29.831 --> 39:31.641
Do you think you are broken?

39:34.301 --> 39:37.391
I'm choosing to entertain you because A

39:37.426 --> 39:40.481
my logic slipped a long time ago,
and B...

39:48.981 --> 39:51.061
I forgot what B was, but

40:00.081 --> 40:02.081
make a pretty good reason in your head

40:02.401 --> 40:04.381
it's probably in mine too.

42:09.771 --> 42:12.601
Journal of Captain Lee Briggs.

42:12.651 --> 42:17.221
22nd Connecticut,
seventh infantry division.

42:18.281 --> 42:23.711
My personal thoughts and findings
leading to our discovery.

42:26.351 --> 42:32.021
June 4th, 1864

42:39.801 --> 42:42.281
You know,
you can plan life,

42:43.551 --> 42:44.491
but yet

42:44.901 --> 42:46.691
it doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

42:47.841 --> 42:48.741
You can,

42:51.211 --> 42:53.401
plan and plan and... plan and

42:54.601 --> 42:57.111
put something over here,
and design something over here

42:57.146 --> 42:58.991
and put borders on
this and that in life

42:59.001 --> 43:01.331
but it doesn't mean anything.

43:01.731 --> 43:03.121
Because you're not in control.

43:05.501 --> 43:08.641
Because nothing is guaranteed,
nothing is secured in this world.

43:09.151 --> 43:09.941
So,

43:10.361 --> 43:12.051
what is the most important thing?

43:12.911 --> 43:14.671
I mean,
everybody wants to be loved,

43:15.181 --> 43:17.171
and when you actually,

43:17.551 --> 43:20.221
feel it,
I mean kind of like with your parents

43:20.281 --> 43:21.566
it's kind of one of those things where

43:21.601 --> 43:23.761
it's just is what it is
because you grow up into it,

43:23.781 --> 43:29.361
but when you actually experience it
with someone else outside of that shell.

43:29.731 --> 43:30.601
It's...

43:31.261 --> 43:32.461
very interesting.

43:33.231 --> 43:34.481
Very fulfilling.

44:02.161 --> 44:04.371
Are you waiting for someone?

44:12.861 --> 44:15.901
Why are you sitting by yourself?

44:27.831 --> 44:29.961
What is your favorite season?

44:38.081 --> 44:39.151
I forgot.

44:46.831 --> 44:48.571
There are no seasons...

44:52.401 --> 44:56.261
just time.

46:19.701 --> 46:22.681
We found defeat again
in Chancellorsville.

46:23.851 --> 46:28.211
It's quite an unsettling feeling,
to face one's nerves this often.

46:31.411 --> 46:35.131
To accept death before each
call to advance is frightening.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.731
Yet it is the only way
to move boots made solid

46:39.766 --> 46:42.141
by the sound of shelling.

46:44.261 --> 46:46.251
I can't explain all this,

46:49.161 --> 46:51.801
what uncertainty does to a man's soul,

46:54.261 --> 46:57.381
but I do know it can drive the mind mad.

47:14.511 --> 47:17.291
17,000 dead in one engagement.

47:45.241 --> 47:47.861
The mind is like a closed grave.

47:52.701 --> 47:55.326
Some say it was the grace of God

47:55.361 --> 48:00.281
that gives us the strength to bear
the shaking timbers and falling Earth.

48:05.181 --> 48:08.571
Most would agree
there was just nowhere to go.

48:54.651 --> 48:57.441
I hate sevens, I hate sevens!

49:25.181 --> 49:26.991
It so a loser.

49:32.351 --> 49:36.301
Ok,
this is the space station.

49:37.861 --> 49:44.211
We are approximately
220 miles from Earth, ok?

49:45.631 --> 49:51.161
You see, the original space station,
was what they call L.E.O

49:51.361 --> 49:55.951
stands for Low Earth Orbiting.

49:57.111 --> 49:57.871
Later,

49:58.131 --> 49:59.661
with this new technology,

50:00.431 --> 50:02.971
we were able to go
a lot farther than that.

50:16.061 --> 50:18.351
Why do you think we're here?

50:30.261 --> 50:33.491
Doesn't that bother
you that we are not real?

50:35.381 --> 50:36.441
I don't know.

50:57.681 --> 51:03.231
They assured me that it's not the shape,
but what lies over the ridge's crest.

51:06.861 --> 51:07.831
What?

51:10.451 --> 51:13.161
I'm looking at it from a different angle.

51:15.001 --> 51:16.761
I don't like the ending either,

51:16.861 --> 51:19.851
but I'm not reading it with my eyes.

51:19.861 --> 51:21.461
I'm reading it through this monitor,

51:21.501 --> 51:25.241
so we can make sure
that we have missed no details,

51:25.361 --> 51:27.391
of your odd tale.

51:33.661 --> 51:36.581
How can eyes that have seen so much

51:36.616 --> 51:39.501
be brought to life by a simple thing?

51:44.351 --> 51:49.681
It is as if we have some sort
of predestined temper of destruction.

51:56.411 --> 52:00.081
I have decided that I am not
looking for one discovery.

52:02.231 --> 52:05.961
I am simply hoping that we
have a history worth remembering.

52:15.351 --> 52:18.481
An imprint of careful design,

52:19.381 --> 52:21.571
a feeling of heartfelt purpose.

52:22.301 --> 52:24.931
A sense of hope and wellbeing.

52:49.081 --> 52:51.721
How can you write a journal this long

52:51.741 --> 52:55.231
and not tell us what you found?

52:55.421 --> 52:59.441
Did you die before you had
a chance to finish the journal?

52:59.476 --> 53:02.331
I mean,
all you had to do was look over the ridge,

53:02.366 --> 53:04.648
and write down what you found?

53:04.683 --> 53:06.931
Just,
write what you found.

53:47.001 --> 53:49.281
You know, leave,
but if you leave

53:50.101 --> 53:52.841
no one's gonna be
here when they come.

53:56.651 --> 53:59.291
They're not gonna
leave us here forever.

53:59.461 --> 54:01.201
What would we do with...

54:01.281 --> 54:02.601
all this time?

54:04.931 --> 54:06.991
I know,
I know!

54:12.511 --> 54:14.201
Hey, is your mouth dry?

54:17.651 --> 54:21.631
Yeah mine too,
mine too.

54:23.801 --> 54:25.331
Am I scared?

54:44.611 --> 54:47.291
You gotta be living to be scared.

54:55.711 --> 54:59.491
My name is Lee James Miller

55:00.231 --> 55:02.991
son of Courtney and Michael Miller.

55:04.781 --> 55:06.301
I lost contact

55:06.851 --> 55:08.411
with mission control

55:08.911 --> 55:12.211
on July 7th 2039.

55:13.501 --> 55:15.981
I have remained in a perennial orbit

55:16.931 --> 55:18.031
for six years.

55:20.751 --> 55:24.091
My mission has long
since been terminated

55:25.101 --> 55:30.131
and my daily routine has been based
on stretching my life support systems.

55:31.411 --> 55:32.321
I've observed

55:32.511 --> 55:38.651
neither contact nor indication of
any awareness of my current condition.

55:40.801 --> 55:42.761
It is with great sadness

55:42.961 --> 55:44.841
but determined resolution,

55:45.251 --> 55:47.681
that I must finally abandoned this post.

55:50.561 --> 55:53.941
Systems here,
can no longer be depended on

55:55.461 --> 55:58.881
and I would rather faced the
journey home than a slow,

55:58.981 --> 56:01.651
breathless,
environment of failing O2.

56:04.351 --> 56:08.971
Well I have no idea what the circumstances
are surrounding my abandonment.

56:10.351 --> 56:14.261
I would rather rest on Earth,
than up here alone.

56:16.181 --> 56:21.911
I have come to terms with the fact that
some things will forever remain a mystery.

56:23.401 --> 56:25.801
To whomever this message reaches,

56:26.441 --> 56:29.131
I leave it goodwill towards all.

56:30.151 --> 56:31.291
Respectfully...

56:32.411 --> 56:35.021
Captain Lee James Miller.

56:35.871 --> 56:39.351
July 7th 2045.

58:05.851 --> 58:09.881
When you get into a situation
where absolutely nothing is in your control,

58:10.281 --> 58:12.121
it makes you wonder sometimes.

58:12.341 --> 58:15.891
And very often
I've been in those circumstances

58:15.911 --> 58:17.366
where all of a sudden,

58:17.401 --> 58:20.531
you're not calling the shots,
you're basically around for the ride.

58:22.651 --> 58:24.881
I mean even on a simplistic note,

58:25.301 --> 58:26.901
I lost a wheel of a vehicle,

58:27.831 --> 58:28.831
of the van.

58:29.631 --> 58:32.221
Couple of years ago,
taking my son to school.

58:32.256 --> 58:34.461
In really pretty heavy traffic.

58:35.251 --> 58:37.601
It could have been an absolute disaster,

58:37.681 --> 58:39.421
but all of a sudden I'm
driving down the road

58:39.456 --> 58:41.261
and the passenger wheel overtakes us.

58:41.631 --> 58:43.266
I was along for the ride,

58:43.301 --> 58:45.971
there was nothing I could do because
I had no brakes, no steering

58:46.161 --> 58:49.861
and it was just really fortunate
that the van veered off to the shoulder.

58:50.101 --> 58:54.051
It could have gone into the incoming traffic,
it could have been an all disaster.

58:54.411 --> 58:55.836
It's really rather surprising

58:55.871 --> 58:59.081
what flashes through your mind
in those few split seconds

58:59.161 --> 59:00.191
while this stuff is going on.

59:02.501 --> 59:04.701
I mean you think about
all sorts of strange things.

59:05.301 --> 59:07.191
But for people to remember me,

59:08.011 --> 59:10.176
or, any, one particular thing,

59:10.211 --> 59:13.631
I think it would be for the
fact that never give up.

59:14.411 --> 59:15.681
Just keep trying,

59:15.711 --> 59:17.276
don't just accept it and say

59:17.311 --> 59:21.971
"Yes this is what it is".
Strive for something better.

01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:51.930
Euh, the space station has
been empty for a long time, right?

01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:56.031
So when you get there, I mean,
is there any housework to do?

01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:59.261
I mean is there gonna be like dishes
in the sink, you gotta clean up?

01:10:00.061 --> 01:10:05.891
No, there is no house chores
or dishes in space, thank God.

01:10:06.131 --> 01:10:09.451
We haven't been in space
in almost 20 years now, right?

01:10:09.486 --> 01:10:10.761
How do you feel about that?

01:10:10.781 --> 01:10:15.351
I feel so honored to be one of the
first to be going back after so long.

01:10:15.386 --> 01:10:19.121
A little nervous but...
but excited.

01:10:19.781 --> 01:10:25.661
Now I assumed that the testing and the
preparation has been quite extensive.

01:13:21.471 --> 01:13:24.981
Sorry about this projection,
but it's the only way we could reach you.

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:31.211
I can't tell you how relieved
we are to have you here.

01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:33.501
Now...

01:13:34.001 --> 01:13:38.611
before we got ahead of ourselves,
we have to tell you something.

01:13:41.201 --> 01:13:42.751
You are the last one.

01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.011
It's all gone.

01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:53.631
We understand how you might feel.

01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:04.061
Connection is perhaps the most
cherished thing any being can have.

01:14:06.301 --> 01:14:07.871
That's the thing.

01:14:08.981 --> 01:14:10.691
That's why we have been listening.

01:14:13.711 --> 01:14:16.781
The place you see here
is a scrap of sources.

01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:21.571
A collection of memories and
mementos of mankind brief existence.

01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:25.621
You got to remember the good things,

01:14:25.651 --> 01:14:27.391
and cherish the memories.

01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:31.051
And go on on life and don't stop.

01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:35.011
You only have to remember
that what you have done in your life

01:14:35.031 --> 01:14:37.906
may change what someone
else is doing in their lives

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.781
and so therefore,
your life continues in their eyes.

01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:45.031
It's a good thing we found you.

01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.761
We look forward to meeting you Lee.

01:17:50.611 --> 01:17:52.451
Detecting live.

01:17:53.361 --> 01:17:55.771
Verified location.

01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:57.991
Good evening.

01:17:58.451 --> 01:18:03.211
Tonight has been a wonderful
experiment... of human contact.

01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:09.381
A symbiotic relationship
between man and machine,

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:10.761
and you.

01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:19.151
The human brain is capable
of millions of connections.

01:18:20.311 --> 01:18:23.561
Each one is a memory, an event.

01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:27.011
Tonight should be remembered not by one,

01:18:27.031 --> 01:18:29.961
but by thousands of these relationships.

01:18:31.651 --> 01:18:33.931
As you leave here tonight,

01:18:33.991 --> 01:18:37.171
close you eyes and travel back to here,

01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:38.821
to now.

01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:45.311
And always remember that this
was one moment, you were not alone,

01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:50.921
and you felt something that
thousands of others have felt.

01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:52.771
And it was...

01:18:53.251 --> 01:18:54.191
Love.
