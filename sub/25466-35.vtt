04:05.549 --> 04:10.032
[voice trembles]
And I never saw her again.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.649
Well, that was nice.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.783
Now, I'll leave camp
and you'll never see me again.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.872
-What?
-It's a camp romance.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.917
So we're destined

and I got revenge!

10:33.458 --> 10:36.244
Besides, now I have
the confidence

10:36.287 --> 10:39.682
to go after other
potential love interests.
