00:21.571 --> 00:23.768
Okay, everyone, here we go.

00:23.770 --> 00:26.503
The movie's about to start.

00:26.505 --> 00:29.470
Centuries ago, our galaxy
was brought to its knees

00:29.472 --> 00:32.902
by an alien race
of unparalleled ruthlessness.

00:32.904 --> 00:36.269
No, not these guys,
these guys.

00:36.271 --> 00:39.335
See? Mean, right?

00:39.337 --> 00:42.302
The invaders possessed
an amulet of unlimited power

00:42.304 --> 00:46.370
known as,
"The Amulet of Unlimited Power."

00:46.372 --> 00:50.269
With it, the aliens conquered
and enslaved every race

00:50.271 --> 00:52.868
on every planet
they encountered,

00:52.870 --> 00:55.602
including our own.

00:55.604 --> 00:57.969
But what the aliens
didn't count on

00:57.971 --> 00:59.936
was the existence
of another creature

00:59.938 --> 01:02.636
who lived amongst the humans,

01:02.638 --> 01:05.402
"The Featherless Condor."

01:05.404 --> 01:08.369
Well, uh, mostly featherless.

01:08.371 --> 01:10.568
The Condor took the amulet
from the invaders,

01:10.570 --> 01:14.568
forcing them to flee into
the far reaches of space.

01:14.570 --> 01:18.403
And there was much rejoicing
and also cake.

01:18.405 --> 01:21.569
Fearing that the aliens might
one day return for the amulet,

01:21.571 --> 01:24.370
The Condor decided to hide it
deep within the earth.

01:24.372 --> 01:28.003
Braving untold dangers,
he reached a secret location

01:28.005 --> 01:30.968
where he knew the amulet
could never be found.

01:34.437 --> 01:37.837
And so,
the galaxy was liberated.

01:39.637 --> 01:43.003
As one generation
succeeded another,

01:43.005 --> 01:46.601
and another, and another,

01:46.603 --> 01:48.635
the descendants
of The Featherless Condor

01:48.637 --> 01:51.701
forgot about the aliens.

01:51.703 --> 01:54.902
But the aliens did not forget.

01:54.904 --> 01:57.836
They swore that one day
they would take back

01:57.838 --> 01:59.769
that which they had lost,
and then,

01:59.771 --> 02:02.636
they would wreak
their vengeance upon us all.

02:22.838 --> 02:26.002
And welcome back
to Pelotillehue Stadium

02:26.004 --> 02:27.969
for this exciting game

02:27.971 --> 02:32.535
brought to you by My Eyes,
My Eyes Tear Gas.

02:32.537 --> 02:35.369
It's the 2,606th match

02:35.371 --> 02:39.036
between Pelotillehue
and Buenas Peras.

02:39.038 --> 02:42.738
And this time, it's personal.

02:45.004 --> 02:47.602
And look at Condorito go,

02:47.604 --> 02:49.501
weaving past
the defenders like a rat

02:49.503 --> 02:51.303
in a bony chicken's kitchen.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.768
Kiss my feathers.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.438
Go, Condorito, go!

03:07.371 --> 03:08.672
Condorito!

03:12.470 --> 03:14.405
I got to do more cardio.

03:15.838 --> 03:17.605
Ignorancio, mark him up.

03:18.670 --> 03:19.735
Huh?

03:19.737 --> 03:21.305
Oh, right away, coach.

03:25.471 --> 03:26.471
Yeah.

03:31.305 --> 03:32.538
Yes, go Tio!

03:35.470 --> 03:36.869
Condorito with a perfect pass

03:36.871 --> 03:39.303
to Iron Throat and...

03:39.305 --> 03:41.502
it seems Egghead has once again

03:41.504 --> 03:44.368
been mistaken for the ball.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.470
But there's Condorito
with the steal.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.635
Oh, wait, what's this,

03:53.637 --> 03:55.736
Pepe Cortisona
has just stolen the ball

03:55.738 --> 03:57.269
from his own teammate.

04:00.837 --> 04:02.702
And look at this, yes,

04:02.704 --> 04:05.369
it's the patented
Pepe pec juggle.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.869
And could it be?

04:06.871 --> 04:09.269
Yeah, he's incorporated
some ass into it.

04:09.271 --> 04:12.003
Oh, what a game we have here
today, ladies and gentlemen,

04:12.005 --> 04:14.702
and now it appears
that Pepe is making googly eyes

04:14.704 --> 04:16.505
at a member of the audience.

04:23.271 --> 04:27.569
My knee, my knee, oh, my knee!

04:27.571 --> 04:29.638
My knee!

04:41.704 --> 04:43.469
He's a murderer.

04:43.471 --> 04:46.668
I can't feel my beak.

04:48.336 --> 04:49.337
Huh?

04:53.804 --> 04:55.668
Use your eyes, fool.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.601
Can't you see that bird brain
is just faking?

04:58.603 --> 05:02.868
Farewell, I'm going
into the light.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.669
And it looks like
the referee has ejected

05:06.671 --> 05:08.002
Pepe for diving.

05:08.004 --> 05:10.769
Papa, is that you?

05:10.771 --> 05:12.668
But of course
the real drama here

05:12.670 --> 05:14.837
right now is Condorito.

05:21.536 --> 05:23.568
I'm okay.

05:23.570 --> 05:24.668
I'm okay.

05:24.670 --> 05:26.035
Never have I seen

05:26.037 --> 05:28.801
such a miraculous recovery.

05:28.803 --> 05:31.635
Hallelujah,
what a moment to be alive,

05:31.637 --> 05:34.401
and with just seconds
left on the clock,

05:34.403 --> 05:37.470
Pelotillehue has the ball.

05:55.005 --> 05:57.335
Hmm?

05:57.337 --> 06:00.569
Goal...

06:00.571 --> 06:03.036
Condorito!

06:04.738 --> 06:06.835
And the referee whistles,

06:06.837 --> 06:10.601
it's over,
1-0 for Pelotillehue!

06:10.603 --> 06:15.404
Victory, victory, victory!

06:17.403 --> 06:19.003
Free drinks for everyone
at El Tupos.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.003
Huh?

06:21.870 --> 06:24.901
Well, at least they got their
priorities straight.

06:24.903 --> 06:27.435
Tio, that was your best
death scene ever.

06:27.437 --> 06:28.534
Thank you, Chickie.

06:28.536 --> 06:30.002
Condorito!

06:30.004 --> 06:32.036
Oh, wait, kids.

06:32.038 --> 06:35.335
I just don't understand what
it is you see in that fool?

06:36.937 --> 06:39.535
Did someone say the orphanage
needs a new ball?

06:39.537 --> 06:41.534
Mm-hmm.

06:42.571 --> 06:44.205
My love, for you.

06:52.637 --> 06:54.002
I had one eye on the clock.

06:54.004 --> 06:56.468
Come on, kids,
it's getting late,

06:56.470 --> 06:57.902
time to get back
on the bus.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.936
It looked like
the Buenas players

07:01.938 --> 07:03.601
were all going after you.

07:03.603 --> 07:05.035
Well, I guess that's
the price you pay

07:05.037 --> 07:06.869
for being this <i>attractivo.</i>

07:08.771 --> 07:10.769
And to who do you dedicate
this victory?

07:10.771 --> 07:12.935
I dedicate this victory
to world peace.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.035
- Oh.
- Aww.

07:14.037 --> 07:15.735
Uh, rainforests.

07:15.737 --> 07:17.334
Aww.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.835
And, of course,
to all the puppies of the world.

07:23.703 --> 07:24.938
No more questions.

07:27.638 --> 07:30.569
Do you always have to flirt
with those...

07:30.571 --> 07:32.602
...those bimbos
after every single game?

07:32.604 --> 07:35.602
Huh? No, I do that
for the ratings.

07:35.604 --> 07:37.302
Oh, please, my darling,

07:37.304 --> 07:40.036
you know my heart beats
only for you.

07:40.038 --> 07:42.434
Yayita, Yayita.

07:42.436 --> 07:43.769
You see?

07:43.771 --> 07:47.036
And look,
I have a surprise. Ta-da!

07:47.038 --> 07:48.902
I got us tickets
to the boxing match tonight.

07:48.904 --> 07:51.735
Bruiser versus
Midget Avenger,

07:51.737 --> 07:53.003
it's gonna be the fight
of the century.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.869
Are you kidding?

07:54.871 --> 07:57.335
Did you forget it's
my mom's birthday tonight?

07:57.337 --> 07:58.371
Hmm.

08:03.771 --> 08:06.905
I didn't forget,
uh, I repressed.

08:08.638 --> 08:09.768
Huh?

08:30.404 --> 08:32.467
Tremebunda, my dear.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.268
Please accept this present
for this felicitous occasion.

08:35.270 --> 08:37.801
Oh, a gift card for the spa?
Thank you.

08:37.803 --> 08:40.902
To preserve your untouched
beauty's perfection.

08:40.904 --> 08:42.333
Her beauty is untouched

08:42.336 --> 08:43.769
because nobody would touch her.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.605
Huh?

08:47.771 --> 08:50.569
Oh, Pepe,
how considerate of you.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.736
Oh, I keep praying
for my daughter

08:52.738 --> 08:55.305
to come to her senses
and find someone like you.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.371
Perhaps she already has.

09:00.638 --> 09:03.434
May I give you a ride home?

09:06.604 --> 09:07.869
Oh, my car!

09:09.670 --> 09:13.001
But Yayita, we were going to go
celebrate at El Tulfo.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.902
You just better
not be late tonight.

09:14.904 --> 09:16.301
What do you mean late?

09:16.303 --> 09:17.871
Is there something
going on tonight?

09:36.436 --> 09:39.569
A toast for the winners.

09:39.571 --> 09:41.335
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:41.337 --> 09:43.868
And one for losers.

09:43.870 --> 09:45.035
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:45.037 --> 09:48.301
And for the winners, yeah.

09:48.303 --> 09:49.470
Cheers.

09:51.271 --> 09:53.902
Uh, Condorito,
are you okay?

09:53.904 --> 09:55.702
Huh, why do you ask?

09:55.704 --> 09:59.569
Oh, it's Pepe,
that bucktooth lead sack

09:59.571 --> 10:02.801
is trying to steal my Yayita
from me with his money.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.601
If it's with money,
then it's not stealing.

10:06.603 --> 10:09.035
The rich think they can
just do whatever they want.

10:09.037 --> 10:11.268
Well, no more,
I tell you, no more.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.801
What are you going to do?

10:12.803 --> 10:14.736
I'm going to get
Pepe out of my way

10:14.738 --> 10:16.601
once and for all.

10:16.603 --> 10:18.269
After this, Pepe Cortisona

10:18.271 --> 10:20.434
will no longer be a problem.

10:20.436 --> 10:22.435
Get rid of Pepe?

10:22.437 --> 10:24.269
Just what are you
planning to do?

10:30.970 --> 10:33.568
- Huh?
- Oh.

10:33.570 --> 10:34.470
Do you have it?

10:45.371 --> 10:47.900
Condorito, are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

10:47.902 --> 10:49.668
There's no other way.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.934
To save Yayita from Pepe,

10:51.936 --> 10:55.301
I must commit the most heinous
sin a man can do.

11:00.437 --> 11:01.502
Propose marriage.

11:03.969 --> 11:05.901
But he was so young.

11:05.903 --> 11:08.402
My friend, you always said
you'd give up your life

11:08.404 --> 11:09.802
before you gave up
your bachelorhood.

11:09.804 --> 11:11.769
Yayita is my life.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.836
Without her, I have nothing.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.468
Well, if that's
how you feel,

11:17.470 --> 11:18.838
then we have to stand
beside you.

11:20.571 --> 11:22.401
This calls for a drink.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.701
To Condorito.

11:23.703 --> 11:25.867
To Condorito.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.635
Are you loco?!

11:28.703 --> 11:30.268
I've got to go!

11:30.270 --> 11:30.934
Right behind you!

11:40.271 --> 11:42.369
How dare you even think
of marrying

11:42.371 --> 11:44.468
my precious Yayita?

11:44.470 --> 11:47.402
But she and I are meant
to be together.

11:47.404 --> 11:48.735
She is meant for a prince,

11:48.737 --> 11:50.702
not some unemployed, ugly,

11:50.704 --> 11:52.268
ignorant, penniless, smelly,

11:52.270 --> 11:54.434
dimwitted,
bird brain like you!

11:54.436 --> 11:56.901
Get this through your thick
excuse for a skull!

11:56.903 --> 11:58.502
As long as I walk this earth,

11:58.504 --> 12:01.338
you will never,
never marry my daughter!

12:10.304 --> 12:12.901
Not now, Washington.

12:19.902 --> 12:23.368
Tio, I hooked us up
to the power line,

12:23.370 --> 12:24.568
hacked into
the neighbor's Wi-Fi,

12:24.570 --> 12:25.868
and put the cockroaches
in the bed

12:25.870 --> 12:27.401
to eat all the bed bugs.

12:27.403 --> 12:28.934
That's good.

12:28.936 --> 12:31.435
Did you have another fight
with Yayita?

12:31.437 --> 12:32.900
It's not Yayita.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.034
It's her mother.

12:34.036 --> 12:35.601
That hairy ogre won't stop

12:35.603 --> 12:36.903
until she breaks us up.

12:40.036 --> 12:41.636
Is there anything for dinner?

12:41.638 --> 12:42.904
Not just anything.

12:44.704 --> 12:48.401
I made your favorite,

12:48.403 --> 12:50.868
pizza with French fries
and ketchup.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.702
Ah, Chickie, you're the best.

12:52.704 --> 12:54.237
It's nothing.

12:58.503 --> 13:00.301
Huh?

13:00.303 --> 13:01.701
That's a weird number.

13:01.703 --> 13:04.302
Hmm, probably
some spam thing.

13:06.303 --> 13:07.934
Ha, nice costume.

13:07.936 --> 13:10.334
Featherless Condor,

13:10.336 --> 13:13.434
we have searched for you
for many space years.

13:13.436 --> 13:16.468
And now, I wish to make you
an offer.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.735
Let me guess,
you have a wireless plan

13:18.737 --> 13:20.035
that is out of this world?

13:21.936 --> 13:25.334
Huh? I'm not a sale rep
for a cell phone provider.

13:25.336 --> 13:27.635
Bring me the amulet
of unlimited power

13:27.637 --> 13:31.269
and I shall give you
anything that you desire.

13:31.271 --> 13:32.835
Shouldn't you say,

13:32.837 --> 13:36.468
"Amulet you bring me.
Anything you desire I give."

13:37.870 --> 13:39.669
That's a stereotype.

13:39.671 --> 13:40.971
We're still waiting.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.968
Amulet you bring me.

13:44.970 --> 13:47.335
Anything you desire I give.

13:53.836 --> 13:56.335
Anything I desire, huh?

13:56.337 --> 13:58.502
Take Tremebunda to your planet.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.204
Then we have ourselves a deal.

14:03.638 --> 14:04.967
I mean,

14:04.969 --> 14:08.268
ourselves a deal we have.

14:23.370 --> 14:26.435
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

14:26.437 --> 14:29.001
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

14:29.003 --> 14:33.269
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear mother ♪</i>

14:33.271 --> 14:38.301
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

14:38.303 --> 14:40.469
I know I asked you to only use
one candle.

14:40.471 --> 14:42.636
Relax, woman.

14:42.638 --> 14:44.837
You'll think different once
I light this baby up.

14:46.504 --> 14:48.471
Dad, do something.

14:56.037 --> 14:57.035
It's okay, Mom.

14:57.037 --> 14:59.237
There now. All good.

15:01.504 --> 15:04.001
Time to open presents.

15:04.003 --> 15:07.535
Ooh, it's that new perfume
we saw at the mall, isn't it?

15:07.537 --> 15:10.435
Even better.

15:10.437 --> 15:12.801
Uh, an electric
razor for women?

15:12.803 --> 15:14.834
It's industrial-strength.

15:14.836 --> 15:17.501
Why, you can shave a bear
with this thing.

15:17.503 --> 15:18.901
Could this night get any worse?

15:22.737 --> 15:24.836
Did somebody order a son-in-law?

15:26.003 --> 15:28.302
Treme.

15:28.304 --> 15:30.268
Why, you don't look
a day over 65.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.835
Mwah.

15:31.837 --> 15:33.634
Well, I'm only 59.

15:33.636 --> 15:35.735
Ah, preparing for the future.

15:35.737 --> 15:36.934
Very clever.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.502
I take it the boxing match
ended early?

15:39.504 --> 15:41.334
My love, please.

15:41.336 --> 15:42.437
Forgive me.

15:46.969 --> 15:48.335
And of course,
I've brought something

15:48.337 --> 15:50.269
for the queen of the day.

15:50.271 --> 15:52.700
Ta-dah.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.900
Uh... I kept the receipt.

15:55.902 --> 15:58.635
Do you all just see
some sort of hairy animal

15:58.637 --> 16:00.368
when you look at me?!

16:00.370 --> 16:01.967
Mom, please, calm down.

16:01.969 --> 16:04.002
Sometimes,
I wish someone would just come

16:04.004 --> 16:06.369
and take me away
from this living hell!

16:08.004 --> 16:10.401
Huh?

16:37.802 --> 16:40.603
Tremebunda. Tremebunda.

16:48.037 --> 16:49.634
No, Mom!

16:49.636 --> 16:51.002
No!

16:51.004 --> 16:52.368
Treme!

17:03.903 --> 17:06.035
Featherless Condor, as agreed,

17:06.037 --> 17:07.867
I have taken Tremebunda.

17:07.869 --> 17:09.967
Now and per our arrangement,

17:09.969 --> 17:12.367
you must bring
the amulet to me.

17:12.369 --> 17:14.335
Um, I didn't literally
mean take her.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.767
Please let her go.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.635
It's all just
a misunderstanding.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.800
Hmm, I see.

17:19.803 --> 17:22.035
Well, in that case,

17:22.037 --> 17:23.601
you have just 24 hours

17:23.603 --> 17:25.035
to bring the amulet to me.

17:25.037 --> 17:28.935
Or you will never see
Tremebunda ever again.

17:33.569 --> 17:36.967
Ha, he peed his pants, right?

17:36.969 --> 17:39.635
Can someone confirm peepee?

17:39.637 --> 17:41.704
Huh? What do you mean
we're still on?

18:12.470 --> 18:15.801
Yayita. Yayita.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.337
Excuse me...

18:25.969 --> 18:29.734
My love,
can we talk for a second?

18:29.736 --> 18:30.867
No.

18:30.869 --> 18:32.700
I'm done
with your excuses.

18:32.702 --> 18:35.002
It's over between us,
Condorito.

18:35.004 --> 18:37.335
Over? But why?

18:37.337 --> 18:38.701
Okay, I guess I know why.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.035
But you got to believe me.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.335
I thought he was trying
to sell me

18:41.337 --> 18:43.035
a new wireless plan.

18:43.037 --> 18:43.868
I never dreamed your mother
would actually

18:43.870 --> 18:45.667
be kidnapped by aliens.

18:45.669 --> 18:47.800
You've been dreaming
about it for years.

18:47.802 --> 18:49.271
Yeah.

18:50.769 --> 18:52.302
But I'm gonna get her back.

18:52.304 --> 18:53.369
I swear.

18:53.371 --> 18:55.269
Sure, you swear.

18:55.271 --> 18:57.600
My mother was right all along.

18:57.602 --> 18:59.035
If only I'd listened to her

18:59.037 --> 19:01.601
before you destroyed all
our lives.

19:01.603 --> 19:02.900
Goodbye, Condorito.

19:02.902 --> 19:04.868
Don't go. Yayita.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.304
Yayita.

19:12.836 --> 19:14.868
There's no need
to worry, buddy.

19:14.870 --> 19:17.001
I'm sure the authorities
will be able

19:17.003 --> 19:18.269
to take care of it.

19:18.271 --> 19:19.436
Uh-huh.

19:25.036 --> 19:27.001
It's a message from the alien.

19:27.003 --> 19:30.035
"The amulet is located
in Condortihuacan,

19:30.037 --> 19:32.801
in a place called The Catacomb
of Certain Luck."

19:32.803 --> 19:34.835
Really?
Well, that sounds easy.

19:34.837 --> 19:37.934
Hang on. No, oops.

19:37.936 --> 19:40.567
Actually, it's The Catacomb
of Certain Death.

19:43.902 --> 19:45.034
What do I do?

19:45.036 --> 19:46.533
Yayita will never forgive me

19:46.535 --> 19:48.268
if I don't save her mother.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.801
Please, we ask you
to show some respect

19:50.803 --> 19:53.269
for what's left of our family

19:53.271 --> 19:55.867
in this time of crisis.

19:55.869 --> 19:58.570
That conniving
buck-toothed lead sack.

20:02.503 --> 20:04.768
Chickie, pack up your things,

20:04.770 --> 20:05.971
we're going on an adventure.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.671
Can I borrow some money?

20:15.869 --> 20:18.500
We still don't
have enough.

20:18.502 --> 20:20.302
- You could go gambling.
- Good idea.

20:20.304 --> 20:21.801
But I don't think we have
enough time to...

20:24.802 --> 20:26.537
Hmm.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.534
Whoa.

20:37.536 --> 20:40.237
It's an adventure.

20:55.802 --> 20:57.868
Here you go.
This young lady will help,

20:57.870 --> 20:59.501
if there's anything
you need.

20:59.503 --> 21:00.667
- Won't you, my dear?
- Ugh.

21:00.669 --> 21:03.269
In my time, parents
would never even think

21:03.271 --> 21:05.735
of letting kids travel
by themselves.

21:05.737 --> 21:07.634
Yeah, but that's because
back in your time,

21:07.636 --> 21:09.002
there was only one continent.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.700
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

21:14.702 --> 21:17.301
Are we there yet? Are we there
yet? Are we there yet?

21:17.303 --> 21:19.868
Oh, how about we find you
something to play with.

21:19.870 --> 21:23.367
Ah, what do we have here?

21:23.369 --> 21:26.333
Oh yeah, it's one of those
inflatable travel pillows.

21:26.335 --> 21:28.034
Now we'll just give it
a little twist here.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.002
And do this.

21:33.802 --> 21:34.603
Here you go.

21:43.435 --> 21:45.303
You have a pleasant flight.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.034
You're a good boy.

21:49.036 --> 21:52.334
It's such a shame that your
parents don't love you.

21:52.336 --> 21:53.800
You're skin and bones.

21:53.802 --> 21:55.534
Don't tell me
they don't feed you.

21:55.536 --> 21:56.935
Actually, I live
with my uncle,

21:56.937 --> 21:58.537
but I do all the cooking
in our place.

22:00.004 --> 22:01.734
Oh.

22:01.736 --> 22:03.901
Excuse me, sir.

22:03.903 --> 22:06.368
Would you please
put this up for me?

22:06.370 --> 22:08.434
But of course, madam.

22:08.436 --> 22:09.568
Huh? Skis?

22:09.570 --> 22:11.604
Who brings skis
to Condortihuacan?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.768
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.433
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet

22:21.435 --> 22:24.400
- and we expect...
- Did he do your laundry?

22:24.402 --> 22:25.834
Clean out your ears?

22:25.836 --> 22:27.667
Take you to the dentist?

22:27.669 --> 22:29.667
Is there anything
he does do for you?

22:29.669 --> 22:31.500
Oh, sure, tons of things.

22:31.502 --> 22:33.801
He showed me how to make
and football.

22:33.803 --> 22:35.568
He should take care of you.

22:35.570 --> 22:39.334
Being an adult
is a great responsibility.

22:39.336 --> 22:40.867
He's responsible.

22:40.869 --> 22:43.333
We hope you have
pleasant flight to Alaska.

22:43.335 --> 22:45.533
Huh?

22:45.535 --> 22:47.667
Because that's where
this plane is going.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.267
What do you mean
this flight

22:51.269 --> 22:52.801
isn't going
to Condortihuacan?

22:52.803 --> 22:55.333
I said it's not landing
in Condortihuacan.

22:55.335 --> 22:56.469
But we still are.

23:01.037 --> 23:02.668
Look there.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.301
That's Condortihuacan.

23:04.303 --> 23:06.600
But that's
thousands of feet below.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.968
Whoa!

23:07.970 --> 23:09.534
Have faith, Chickie.

23:09.536 --> 23:11.368
This is all part
of a plan.

23:11.370 --> 23:12.104
Whoa!

23:14.535 --> 23:16.835
Okay, that wasn't part
of the plan.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.404
It's the only way to fly.

23:33.736 --> 23:34.835
What did I tell you?

23:34.837 --> 23:36.971
Absolutely nothing
to worry about.

23:39.603 --> 23:42.469
Something to worry about,
something to worry about.

23:47.037 --> 23:48.534
But I'm too young to die!

23:48.536 --> 23:50.467
Aw, don't be like that.

23:50.469 --> 23:51.534
A little twist.

23:51.536 --> 23:53.301
Here, have an elephant.

24:08.636 --> 24:13.268
Soon I will have that power.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.401
But first,
it's my lunch time.

24:21.269 --> 24:23.667
Prepare to be devoured,

24:23.669 --> 24:26.468
lasagna.

24:26.470 --> 24:29.001
Where,
where's my lunchbox?

24:29.003 --> 24:31.701
Computer,
where is my lunchbox?

24:31.703 --> 24:33.434
I don't know, Your Majesty.

24:33.436 --> 24:35.337
Did you check under your seat?

24:40.836 --> 24:42.002
It's not under my seat.

24:51.736 --> 24:52.900
Come on, guys.

24:52.902 --> 24:54.934
I know we talked about this.

24:54.936 --> 24:57.267
We'll never manage
to re-enslave the universe

24:57.269 --> 24:58.534
unless we...?

25:01.937 --> 25:03.768
Unless we acknowledge
and respect

25:03.770 --> 25:05.901
the chain of command.

25:05.903 --> 25:09.437
So, let's just try to be
respectful of that, okay?

25:11.469 --> 25:12.303
Huh?

25:14.970 --> 25:16.901
Emperor Molosco,

25:16.903 --> 25:18.834
the captive has been secured
in the abduction chamber.

25:18.836 --> 25:20.734
I'm coming.

25:36.636 --> 25:40.701
Where's my lunchbox?
Where's my lunchbox?

25:41.703 --> 25:43.401
Where's my lunchbox?

25:46.737 --> 25:48.270
Huh?

25:56.469 --> 25:58.501
Oh, my gods.

25:58.503 --> 26:00.503
She's incredible.

26:03.502 --> 26:06.967
This specimen's
gigantic.

26:06.969 --> 26:10.468
She's like a living,
breathing planet.

26:10.470 --> 26:12.668
I kind of just want
to orbit her.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.668
Keep your tentacles
away from me,

26:14.670 --> 26:15.900
you intergalactic pervert!

26:17.402 --> 26:19.403
I'm a lady,
not a specimen!

26:30.302 --> 26:32.800
Wow.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.369
- What do we do?
- Lower the force field.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.501
Hey, hey!

26:45.503 --> 26:48.835
I demand that you
let me out of here at once!

27:04.303 --> 27:05.767
We've lost the chicken.

27:05.769 --> 27:07.536
I repeat,
we've lost the chicken.

27:13.536 --> 27:16.837
- Ma'am, what do we do?
- We're going in there.

27:23.303 --> 27:25.734
You see?
Now that wasn't so bad.

27:25.736 --> 27:27.900
Oh, oh. Ugh.

27:27.902 --> 27:31.468
- <i>Reflauta.</i>
- Ow.

27:36.035 --> 27:38.268
You okay?

27:38.270 --> 27:39.967
Tio, how come
you didn't check

27:39.969 --> 27:41.634
where the plane was going?

27:41.636 --> 27:43.734
I guess I thought
you were on that.

27:43.736 --> 27:44.701
But forget it.

27:44.703 --> 27:46.268
Come on.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.600
We're running out of time.

27:49.935 --> 27:52.467
To additional adventure.

28:05.336 --> 28:06.967
Poor Condorito.

28:06.969 --> 28:09.900
Why couldn't they have just
taken my wife instead?

28:09.902 --> 28:11.368
All I can say is

28:11.370 --> 28:13.533
I hope he has
health insurance

28:13.535 --> 28:14.933
for The Catacombs
of Certain Death.

28:14.935 --> 28:17.700
Condorito
can take care of himself.

28:17.702 --> 28:20.301
It's him we have to worry about.

28:20.303 --> 28:22.801
That donkey is going
to seduce Yayita

28:22.803 --> 28:24.367
while Condorito is away.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.667
- It's Pepe's car.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

28:25.669 --> 28:26.567
It's irresistible.

28:26.569 --> 28:27.800
Ladies.

28:27.802 --> 28:28.967
Aww.

28:28.969 --> 28:30.899
Ow.

28:30.901 --> 28:32.568
So, it's his car, eh?

28:32.570 --> 28:33.966
Well then,
it's time for us

28:33.968 --> 28:36.268
to level the playing field.

28:36.270 --> 28:37.668
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

28:37.670 --> 28:38.835
Yes, Coach.

28:47.603 --> 28:49.434
Let me tell you,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.966
if you even think about doing
any experiments on me...

28:51.968 --> 28:54.866
Actually
I was just wondering

28:54.868 --> 28:57.833
if you would be
my guest for dinner

28:57.835 --> 29:00.734
- tonight.
- Oh?

29:00.736 --> 29:02.936
If you have no other plans.

29:08.436 --> 29:09.504
Huh?

29:12.602 --> 29:14.601
Sweet baby Jupiter.

29:14.603 --> 29:15.671
Whoa.

29:34.737 --> 29:36.571
Welcome, my dear.

29:43.002 --> 29:45.301
I bet you must
be starving.

29:45.303 --> 29:46.534
I had my chef

29:46.536 --> 29:47.966
prepare something special

29:47.968 --> 29:50.734
for a carnivore
such as you.

29:50.736 --> 29:52.734
Ta-dum,

29:52.736 --> 29:54.034
he cooked himself for you.

29:54.036 --> 29:55.401
Go on.

29:55.403 --> 29:57.800
Dig in and devour
Garbaggio.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.400
Um, we also have empanadas.

30:19.302 --> 30:21.567
I hope you'll excuse me.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.034
It's been a while since
someone's taken me to dinner.

30:24.036 --> 30:25.333
Huh? How can that be

30:25.335 --> 30:27.501
for a beauty such as you?

30:27.503 --> 30:28.799
Surely you must
dine out often

30:28.801 --> 30:29.900
with your human male beau.

30:29.902 --> 30:31.866
Do you mean Cuasi?

30:31.868 --> 30:33.734
For our anniversary dinner,

30:33.736 --> 30:35.434
he took me to a drive-thru

30:35.436 --> 30:36.635
and forgot me.

30:36.637 --> 30:38.866
Ugh. Your male thing,

30:38.868 --> 30:42.203
I believe I may have seen him
on our Earth cam.

30:45.637 --> 30:48.300
Cuasi, but
you promised me an exclusive.

30:48.302 --> 30:49.733
But why would he
want to go with you

30:49.735 --> 30:51.634
when he can have me?

30:51.636 --> 30:54.699
I know, why don't we
all interview him together?

30:54.701 --> 30:57.300
Not a bad idea.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.034
I just don't get it.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.867
Why does your male thing
get aroused by those

31:12.869 --> 31:14.766
sickly, bony females?

31:14.768 --> 31:16.799
Well, because he's an ape.
That's why.

31:16.801 --> 31:18.767
But they're nothing
but skeletons.

31:18.769 --> 31:21.468
How can one
respect a female

31:21.470 --> 31:24.699
who is not even respected
by the force of gravity?

31:25.769 --> 31:27.666
On my planet,

31:27.668 --> 31:28.799
the more gravity
you have,

31:28.801 --> 31:30.967
the less respect
you get.

31:30.969 --> 31:33.267
A big woman can't go
even a single day

31:33.269 --> 31:36.900
without being the butt
of some stupid joke,

31:36.902 --> 31:39.304
even on my own birthday.

31:44.835 --> 31:47.735
I understand what
it's like to be mocked.

31:49.969 --> 31:54.434
My ancestors ruled
the entire universe.

31:54.436 --> 31:55.966
But me,

31:55.968 --> 31:57.834
I don't even rule
the mini fridge

31:57.836 --> 32:00.500
on my own spaceship,
nothing.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.934
But one day soon

32:01.936 --> 32:04.001
when I get my hands
on the amulet,

32:04.003 --> 32:05.434
I'll put them all
in their place

32:05.436 --> 32:09.034
and once again
the iron tentacle shall rule.

32:09.036 --> 32:12.666
Then I'll only need one thing
to make my life complete.

32:12.668 --> 32:13.833
And what's that?

32:13.835 --> 32:15.967
The most important thing
of all,

32:15.969 --> 32:17.700
a queen.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.401
Molosco says that
only The Featherless Condor

32:37.403 --> 32:38.736
can enter the catacombs.

32:42.535 --> 32:44.334
Once inside,

32:44.336 --> 32:46.300
he'll fight
a terrifying guardian.

32:46.302 --> 32:47.567
Eh, I don't buy it.

32:47.569 --> 32:48.833
Just look at this place,

32:48.835 --> 32:50.634
nothing but
an old pile of rocks.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.867
It's not waiting for...

32:51.869 --> 32:53.869
the Great Featherless Condor.

33:03.769 --> 33:05.834
Whoever built this place

33:05.836 --> 33:07.870
did not have
a happy childhood.

33:10.869 --> 33:12.599
Maybe the guardian
bit the dust, too.

33:12.601 --> 33:13.666
I bet he's dead.

33:13.668 --> 33:16.034
Oh, he's dead all right.

33:20.835 --> 33:22.767
According to the message,

33:22.769 --> 33:25.834
the guardian's job
is to protect the amulet.

33:25.836 --> 33:27.966
Whenever someone sets foot
in the dungeon,

33:27.968 --> 33:29.899
he rises from the dead
to fight them

33:29.901 --> 33:32.001
and fulfill
his sacred duty.

33:32.003 --> 33:34.268
Huh. The guy must be
some kind of loser

33:34.270 --> 33:35.702
to keep working
after death.

33:38.303 --> 33:40.301
Grandpa Rito?

33:47.936 --> 33:49.532
Oops.

33:49.534 --> 33:50.835
<i>Reflauta.</i>

33:52.435 --> 33:53.733
Oh, no.

34:09.936 --> 34:11.268
Over there.

34:12.835 --> 34:14.301
He's coming.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.536
Faster, faster.

34:26.034 --> 34:28.703
Slower, slower.

34:31.302 --> 34:33.402
In your face,
great-grandpa.

34:37.801 --> 34:39.833
What the?

35:02.669 --> 35:03.800
This is very confusing.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.034
Look.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.636
Now that's just
unnecessary.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.770
Hold on tight.

35:18.270 --> 35:20.001
Uh-oh.

35:28.636 --> 35:32.633
Oh. And this is why
I hate family reunions.

35:40.968 --> 35:42.669
Uh, Tio?

35:52.002 --> 35:55.766
No, we haven't
received any word yet.

35:55.768 --> 35:56.866
I guess we just have
to be patient.

35:56.868 --> 35:58.300
Come in.

35:59.568 --> 36:01.270
It's Uncle Pepe.

36:03.869 --> 36:06.567
We wanna play with you.

36:06.569 --> 36:07.667
No.

36:12.836 --> 36:15.001
Yayita,
so good to see you.

36:15.003 --> 36:17.000
Sorry,
it's not a good time.

36:17.002 --> 36:18.466
The boiler broke,

36:18.468 --> 36:20.866
the toilets are all clogged.

36:20.868 --> 36:23.000
Condorito
was supposed to help,

36:23.002 --> 36:24.402
but now he's gone.

36:37.835 --> 36:39.499
Hey, Ignorancio.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.001
- Huh?
- The car.

36:42.003 --> 36:43.669
Oh, aye, aye.

36:55.835 --> 36:57.400
Hey, Coach, it's done.

36:57.402 --> 36:59.301
Excellent.

36:59.303 --> 37:00.567
Wait. Oh, no,

37:00.569 --> 37:02.699
that's my car.

37:02.701 --> 37:04.833
Well, at least the roof
isn't falling down on our heads.

37:10.535 --> 37:13.766
Looks like only an angel
could save us now.

37:13.768 --> 37:14.767
Oh.

37:17.270 --> 37:18.933
Thank you. Thank you.

37:18.935 --> 37:20.666
And now I'd like to unveil

37:20.668 --> 37:23.700
the Cortisona Orphanage.

37:23.702 --> 37:26.033
Wow.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.000
It's completely
state-of-the-art

37:28.002 --> 37:29.567
including an
pool,

37:29.569 --> 37:31.967
a display
for perspective parents,

37:31.969 --> 37:33.532
a gym, and of course

37:33.534 --> 37:35.333
an on-site dental hygienist

37:35.335 --> 37:37.800
for that perfect
Cortisona smile.

37:37.802 --> 37:39.034
I can't believe it.

37:39.036 --> 37:41.332
That jerk's
doing charity now?

37:41.334 --> 37:42.967
How low can he go?

37:42.969 --> 37:44.900
Now, many of you
must be wondering,

37:44.902 --> 37:46.800
Pepe Cortisona,

37:46.802 --> 37:48.934
why are you throwing
your money away

37:48.936 --> 37:51.467
on something as worthless
as needy children?

37:51.469 --> 37:53.267
All I can really say is

37:53.269 --> 37:55.599
when I looked at these
beautiful kids' faces,

37:55.601 --> 37:57.867
well, they touched me.

37:59.302 --> 38:00.936
They touched me!

38:03.935 --> 38:05.399
As I was saying,

38:05.401 --> 38:06.733
I also must give credit

38:06.735 --> 38:08.700
to the splendiferous
headmistress

38:08.702 --> 38:10.700
of this wonderful
establishment.

38:10.702 --> 38:13.532
She showed me
that generosity

38:13.534 --> 38:15.400
is about more than getting
your name on a plaque,

38:15.402 --> 38:16.569
even my name.

38:19.269 --> 38:20.733
Well, my friends,

38:20.735 --> 38:22.033
I'm afraid it's over.

38:24.269 --> 38:25.699
Oh.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.767
That must be
the Amulet of Unlimited Power.

38:33.769 --> 38:34.899
Run, Chickie, run.

38:37.736 --> 38:39.499
Hurry.

38:46.302 --> 38:47.766
Tio, over there.

38:59.635 --> 39:01.299
Huh?

39:01.301 --> 39:02.603
There.

39:07.402 --> 39:10.734
Feel my unlimited power.

39:16.902 --> 39:19.933
My power still feels
fairly limited.

39:19.935 --> 39:22.867
I know, it must be
laser vision.

39:25.902 --> 39:27.400
Huh?

39:27.402 --> 39:28.970
My power is flight.

39:32.468 --> 39:35.368
Come on, guys,
can't we be friends?

39:39.401 --> 39:40.700
Okay.

39:40.702 --> 39:42.670
Now, I need
some space, guys.

39:46.568 --> 39:48.001
Ah, that's it.
That's what it does.

39:48.003 --> 39:50.699
The Amulet gives you the power
to control minds.

39:50.701 --> 39:53.499
Oh, time to have
some fun now.

40:34.835 --> 40:36.467
Tio.

40:40.534 --> 40:41.799
Hey, you know,
I think you're actually

40:41.801 --> 40:44.866
less pale
than regular Egghead.

40:44.868 --> 40:46.332
Tio,

40:46.334 --> 40:48.667
look at this.

40:50.402 --> 40:51.800
We have to call the Octopus.

40:51.802 --> 40:53.600
No. Uh, uh...

41:05.802 --> 41:07.432
Yes.

41:07.434 --> 41:08.533
Wait.

41:08.535 --> 41:10.266
Huh? What are you doing?

41:10.268 --> 41:11.700
If we get the Amulet
to Molosco,

41:11.702 --> 41:12.766
he'll use it to enslave

41:12.768 --> 41:14.432
every planet in the galaxy.

41:14.434 --> 41:16.300
Huh? What are you
talking about?

41:16.302 --> 41:18.000
That's why the guardian
hid it here,

41:18.002 --> 41:20.899
to stop the Moloscosians.

41:20.901 --> 41:22.600
But I promised Yayita.

41:22.602 --> 41:24.667
This is the only way
to bring her mother back.

41:24.669 --> 41:26.734
Think about it.
This is the most powerful

41:26.736 --> 41:28.533
weapon in the universe.

41:28.535 --> 41:30.500
Molosco could even use it
here to conquer Earth.

41:30.502 --> 41:31.566
Whoa.

41:31.568 --> 41:33.700
Look, it's Earth, right?

41:33.702 --> 41:36.700
If he goes alphabetically
there's A, B, C, and D.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.532
It could take centuries
before they get here.

41:38.534 --> 41:40.600
Tio, if you do this,

41:40.602 --> 41:43.967
then billions of creatures
will suffer.

41:43.969 --> 41:47.532
Protecting them
is our responsibility,

41:47.534 --> 41:49.034
right?

41:50.701 --> 41:51.799
Yeah.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.834
We'll find another way.

42:14.869 --> 42:16.970
Don't remember any of this.

42:25.936 --> 42:27.533
No, Tio, don't do it.

42:27.535 --> 42:31.366
Now, you give me back
my She-Shrek.

42:31.368 --> 42:33.299
No, can do I'm afraid.

42:33.301 --> 42:36.399
Treme will be returning
for the foreseeable future.

42:36.401 --> 42:38.267
But I made a deal with you.

42:38.269 --> 42:40.366
The Amulet for Tremebunda.

42:40.368 --> 42:43.267
Well, then I guess
it sucks to be you

42:43.269 --> 42:44.667
or should I say,

42:44.669 --> 42:46.967
you to be it sucks?

42:46.969 --> 42:47.970
Bye-bye.

42:49.334 --> 42:50.400
Come back.

42:50.402 --> 42:51.600
You can't do this.

42:51.602 --> 42:54.467
I'll sue. Wait.

42:54.469 --> 42:56.802
No!

43:01.568 --> 43:03.400
Yeah, they're back.

43:03.402 --> 43:05.367
Huh? Whoa.

43:05.369 --> 43:08.436
I demand an explanation!

43:18.301 --> 43:20.734
May I please
have your attention?

43:23.802 --> 43:26.299
For centuries
our people have... oh.

43:27.468 --> 43:28.634
Hey.

43:33.002 --> 43:35.733
Okay. Will you please

43:35.735 --> 43:38.202
shut up?!

43:40.901 --> 43:42.699
Now, that's more like it.

43:42.701 --> 43:44.567
That's right.

43:44.569 --> 43:47.667
I don't even wanna hear
you breathing, understood?

43:50.402 --> 43:52.867
As I was saying,
for centuries

43:52.869 --> 43:55.766
we've dreamt of
reestablishing our dominion.

43:55.768 --> 43:58.332
Today, we have regained

43:58.334 --> 44:00.433
the Amulet of Unlimited Power,

44:00.435 --> 44:03.033
otherwise known as the Amulet

44:03.035 --> 44:04.736
of Unlimited Power.

44:07.401 --> 44:08.800
With it,
we shall enslave

44:08.802 --> 44:10.333
every single planet

44:10.335 --> 44:12.933
in the entire galaxy,

44:12.935 --> 44:13.966
and we'll go

44:13.968 --> 44:15.703
in alphabetical order.

44:16.769 --> 44:18.567
Navigator,

44:18.569 --> 44:19.633
establish a course

44:19.635 --> 44:21.499
for the first planet,

44:21.501 --> 44:22.736
A.

44:24.435 --> 44:26.733
All hail the Moloscosians.

45:00.968 --> 45:02.799
I have some good news

45:02.801 --> 45:04.866
and I thought we could
celebrate together.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.400
Yes, of course.

45:06.402 --> 45:08.834
Let me just go freshen up.

45:08.836 --> 45:10.466
Get the Navigator.

45:10.468 --> 45:11.899
Uh, Your Highness...

45:11.901 --> 45:14.466
If your partner harbors
feelings for an ex,

45:14.468 --> 45:15.733
the best course of action

45:15.735 --> 45:17.333
is to enslave him

45:17.335 --> 45:19.866
and every other sentient being
on his planet,

45:19.868 --> 45:21.933
don't you agree, Cosmo?

45:21.935 --> 45:24.634
We will return for you later,

45:24.636 --> 45:26.766
Planet A.

45:26.768 --> 45:29.266
You will obey my command.

45:29.268 --> 45:31.266
If this is about stealing

45:31.268 --> 45:33.367
the neighbor's Wi-Fi,
I can totally explain.

45:33.369 --> 45:35.566
- Huh?
- Terminated unexpectedly?

45:35.568 --> 45:38.303
I'll show you terminated
unexpectedly.

45:39.802 --> 45:40.670
Where are we?

45:42.435 --> 45:44.467
This is the secret
headquarters

45:44.469 --> 45:47.236
of the International
Space Invaders Defense Program.

45:52.269 --> 45:54.433
Does anybody
have a blank floppy?

45:54.435 --> 45:55.899
Ah,

45:55.901 --> 45:57.367
I think it's a museum.

45:57.369 --> 45:59.503
We, um, had a couple
of budget cuts.

46:01.635 --> 46:03.833
For years,
our unit has been tasked

46:03.835 --> 46:05.634
with secretly defending Earth

46:05.636 --> 46:06.933
from alien attacks.

46:06.935 --> 46:09.266
With what?
Pointy sticks?

46:12.035 --> 46:13.367
We've faced threats

46:13.369 --> 46:14.667
from every corner

46:14.669 --> 46:15.503
of the Universe,

46:17.369 --> 46:19.799
but none as great
as the Moloscosians.

46:19.801 --> 46:21.633
They were the cruelest tyrants

46:21.635 --> 46:23.299
in the galaxy.

46:23.301 --> 46:25.366
And now,
they want their title back.

46:28.434 --> 46:30.202
Hmm?

46:31.434 --> 46:33.899
Luckily, we were prepared.

46:33.901 --> 46:36.266
Our operation
will vanquish the aliens

46:36.268 --> 46:38.832
and, of course,
rescue Tremebunda.

46:38.834 --> 46:40.500
The important thing
is that we found you

46:40.502 --> 46:42.733
before you gave Molosco
the Amulet.

46:42.735 --> 46:44.367
Otherwise,
your Treme,

46:44.369 --> 46:45.966
along with every other being
in the Universe,

46:45.968 --> 46:47.266
would be totally

46:47.268 --> 46:49.567
and utterly doomed.

46:52.934 --> 46:53.935
What?

46:57.868 --> 46:59.902
Argh! He gave
the Amulet to Molosco.

47:01.702 --> 47:03.898
- He what?
- I had no choice.

47:03.900 --> 47:05.699
I had to do it in order
to bring Treme back

47:05.701 --> 47:07.634
to my girlfriend
or else she'd marry Pepe.

47:08.669 --> 47:09.966
I-I didn't know.

47:11.501 --> 47:14.865
I thought
he was a wireless carrier.

47:14.867 --> 47:17.267
Have you any idea
what you've done?

47:17.269 --> 47:19.999
Well, if they go
in alphabetical order,

47:20.001 --> 47:21.433
we'll be all right.

47:31.534 --> 47:33.332
It's the aliens.

47:33.334 --> 47:34.932
We have their trajectory.

47:34.934 --> 47:36.433
And they're headed for...

47:53.468 --> 47:54.865
Uh, for Earth!

47:58.302 --> 47:59.666
Excuse me.

48:03.968 --> 48:05.467
No,
this is not a good...

48:06.867 --> 48:08.766
Why do these things

48:08.768 --> 48:10.702
always seem to happen to me?

48:13.468 --> 48:15.533
Huh?

48:15.535 --> 48:16.567
They don't just happen to you,

48:16.569 --> 48:18.266
you made them happen.

48:18.268 --> 48:19.698
- Huh?
- You never cook,

48:19.700 --> 48:20.866
you never do the laundry,

48:20.868 --> 48:23.567
and you never clean my ears.

48:23.569 --> 48:25.000
And now,

48:25.002 --> 48:27.400
you put the whole planet
in danger.

48:27.402 --> 48:30.500
You're such a nitwit.

48:30.502 --> 48:31.732
Chickie, that is no way

48:31.734 --> 48:32.966
- to talk to your...
- My what?

48:32.968 --> 48:34.798
Were you gonna say elder?

48:34.800 --> 48:36.532
I'm more elder than you.

48:36.534 --> 48:39.533
Do you know why he always
wears those flip-flops?

48:39.535 --> 48:41.366
It's because he doesn't know

48:41.368 --> 48:42.933
how to tie shoelaces.

48:42.935 --> 48:44.466
Shh, shh,

48:44.468 --> 48:46.798
that was supposed
to be our secret.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.766
I thought you were so cool,

48:48.768 --> 48:50.567
my uncle,
the town hero.

48:50.569 --> 48:52.333
But real heroes?

48:52.335 --> 48:54.698
They go on adventures
to save others.

48:54.700 --> 48:56.633
The only person
you ever worry about

48:56.635 --> 48:58.432
is you.

48:58.434 --> 49:00.732
I guess you really
are just a birdbrain,

49:00.734 --> 49:02.600
aren't you?

49:02.602 --> 49:03.802
I'm going to my room.

49:07.335 --> 49:08.698
I know.

49:08.700 --> 49:10.733
It's the other way.

49:10.735 --> 49:12.698
Captain Kotori-san,

49:12.700 --> 49:15.033
the Sotorions are using
the stolen crystal

49:15.035 --> 49:17.633
to power the robotic
armadillo death ray.

49:17.635 --> 49:19.333
Fear not,
square tooth,

49:19.335 --> 49:21.299
now that I have vowed
my inner strength

49:21.301 --> 49:23.467
by living up
to my responsibilities,

49:23.469 --> 49:24.798
I am confident

49:24.800 --> 49:26.000
that no enemy will be able

49:26.002 --> 49:28.333
to withstand my attack.

49:28.335 --> 49:30.436
By the power of friendship.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.566
Our only hope
is to destroy

49:43.568 --> 49:44.533
the alien mother ship

49:44.535 --> 49:46.033
before it reaches Earth.

49:46.035 --> 49:47.665
I've designed a virus

49:47.667 --> 49:48.999
that will cause the core

49:49.001 --> 49:51.533
of the mother ship
to overheat.

49:51.535 --> 49:53.666
However, someone
has to go up there

49:53.668 --> 49:55.798
to install it manually.

49:55.800 --> 49:56.966
- Not it.
- Not it.

49:56.968 --> 49:58.432
Oh, man.

49:59.934 --> 50:02.267
The problem is the amulet
will alert Molosco

50:02.269 --> 50:04.633
to any approaching
foreign intelligence,

50:04.635 --> 50:06.533
even yours.

50:06.535 --> 50:09.332
Only someone with a nearly
undetectable IQ

50:09.334 --> 50:10.765
could sneak into that ship,

50:10.767 --> 50:12.966
a complete birdbrain,
if you will,

50:12.968 --> 50:15.798
but where to find
such an idiot?

50:15.800 --> 50:18.335
Boss, I'm your idiot.

50:22.668 --> 50:24.332
The Featherless Condor

50:24.334 --> 50:25.565
is immune to the amulet.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.999
How do you know that?

50:27.001 --> 50:28.633
I, uh...

50:28.635 --> 50:30.369
I tried it on my nephew.

50:31.900 --> 50:33.532
I know I said idiot,

50:33.534 --> 50:35.332
but this is too much, no?

50:35.334 --> 50:37.333
Wait, please.

50:37.335 --> 50:38.766
I can do it.

50:38.768 --> 50:39.966
I do have an iguana

50:39.968 --> 50:40.802
that's quite gifted.

50:42.301 --> 50:43.402
Okay, Condor.

50:44.601 --> 50:46.834
Yeah, take me to my shuttle.

50:48.335 --> 50:49.802
Take me to my house.

50:58.035 --> 50:59.400
She may not look like much,

50:59.402 --> 51:00.735
but boy, can she fly.

51:04.967 --> 51:06.032
The shuttle is equipped

51:06.034 --> 51:07.699
with an automatic pilot

51:07.701 --> 51:09.666
that will handle both
the takeoff and landing.

51:09.668 --> 51:10.933
Huh?

51:10.935 --> 51:13.865
Autopilot,
restrain the Captain.

51:13.867 --> 51:15.798
Activating restraining system.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.633
Once you've completed
your mission,

51:17.635 --> 51:20.499
all you have to do is say
the code word, "Bingo"

51:20.501 --> 51:22.499
and the autopilot
will take you to Earth.

51:22.501 --> 51:24.333
Say it, Bingo.

51:25.434 --> 51:26.633
Uh, bingo.

51:26.635 --> 51:28.933
Autopilot, release the Captain.

51:28.935 --> 51:31.332
Deactivating restraint.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.899
What's troubling you?

51:37.901 --> 51:39.899
I'm worried
that I might, uh...

51:39.901 --> 51:41.966
Screw things up?

51:41.968 --> 51:45.202
Unfortunately,
that is my claim to fame.

51:47.967 --> 51:49.666
Here's a tip,

51:49.668 --> 51:51.833
to make things easier,

51:51.835 --> 51:53.432
don't think about
saving the world,

51:53.434 --> 51:54.833
it's too big,

51:54.835 --> 51:57.633
think about saving
those who you love.

51:57.635 --> 51:59.665
Keep them in your heart.

51:59.667 --> 52:00.969
They'll guide you home.

52:03.001 --> 52:04.531
Did someone say the orphanage

52:04.533 --> 52:05.632
- needs a new ball?
- Mm-hmm.

52:05.634 --> 52:07.632
To Condorito!

52:09.800 --> 52:11.299
Yayita.

52:11.301 --> 52:13.999
Yayita. You see?

52:14.001 --> 52:15.768
But you'll
probably die anyway.

52:17.302 --> 52:18.566
Ground crew,

52:18.568 --> 52:19.702
prepare for lift off.

52:39.701 --> 52:40.932
Wow,

52:40.934 --> 52:42.865
the kids are going
to be so happy here.

52:42.867 --> 52:45.798
I'd do anything
for those sweet little angels.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.599
Yayita, there's something

52:47.601 --> 52:48.966
I've been meaning to ask you.

52:48.968 --> 52:50.799
These last few days together

52:50.801 --> 52:52.431
have made me feel things

52:52.433 --> 52:53.966
that I've never felt before.

52:53.968 --> 52:56.033
Gratitude, empathy.

52:56.035 --> 52:57.431
Why, today,

52:57.433 --> 52:58.969
I even tried reading a book.

53:00.434 --> 53:01.598
I know there's nothing

53:01.600 --> 53:02.966
you can't handle on your own,

53:02.968 --> 53:05.465
but still I'd do
anything for you.

53:06.834 --> 53:09.333
Pepe, I'm speechless.

53:09.335 --> 53:11.635
It's what your mother
would have wanted.

53:20.568 --> 53:22.269
No!

53:23.701 --> 53:25.398
Oh, God, no, my baby,

53:25.400 --> 53:26.498
please say you're not scratched,

53:26.500 --> 53:27.932
say you're not scratched.

53:33.368 --> 53:34.465
Huh?

53:34.467 --> 53:36.367
You get your hands off her,

53:38.035 --> 53:40.765
because your Uncle Pepe
needs a hug.

53:42.434 --> 53:43.932
Huh?

53:43.934 --> 53:45.398
This just in.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.698
An alien warship
is approaching Earth.

53:47.700 --> 53:48.866
Sources say the invaders

53:48.868 --> 53:50.699
have an entire armada.

53:50.701 --> 53:52.798
Apparently,
they are the same aliens

53:52.800 --> 53:55.399
who had previously
abducted Tremebunda,

53:55.401 --> 53:57.366
and now they intend
to put an end

53:57.368 --> 53:58.599
to our civilization.

53:58.601 --> 54:00.932
- Treme.
- Officials tell us Earth forces

54:00.934 --> 54:02.266
are preparing a mission

54:02.268 --> 54:03.599
to stop the aliens,

54:03.601 --> 54:06.267
a mission being led by...

54:06.269 --> 54:07.633
by Pelotillehue midfielder,

54:07.635 --> 54:08.965
- Condorito?
- Huh?

54:08.967 --> 54:10.833
Huh?

54:10.835 --> 54:12.898
Well, it looks
like we're toast.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.666
We take you now live
to the launch site.

54:17.835 --> 54:19.632
Ten...

54:19.634 --> 54:21.365
nine...

54:21.367 --> 54:22.698
eight...

54:22.700 --> 54:24.399
seven...

54:24.401 --> 54:25.832
six...

54:25.834 --> 54:27.399
five...

54:27.401 --> 54:28.833
five...

54:28.835 --> 54:30.366
five...

54:30.368 --> 54:32.000
five...

54:32.002 --> 54:33.266
Lift off.

54:44.968 --> 54:47.466
Yeah, it worked!

54:47.468 --> 54:50.266
Stop all this shaking,

54:50.268 --> 54:52.865
please, autopilot.

54:52.867 --> 54:54.465
Stop, autopilot.

54:54.467 --> 54:56.298
Stopping autopilot.

54:56.300 --> 54:58.634
Manual controls activated.

55:04.368 --> 55:05.532
No.

55:05.534 --> 55:07.733
What's he doing?

55:15.900 --> 55:17.599
Autopilot,

55:17.601 --> 55:19.865
which one's the autopilot?

55:19.867 --> 55:21.532
- Oh.
- It's the big red one.

55:21.534 --> 55:22.835
Huh?

55:28.268 --> 55:29.332
Activated.

55:29.334 --> 55:30.335
Thank you.

55:31.468 --> 55:32.468
Chickie?

55:35.467 --> 55:36.966
What are you doing here?

55:36.968 --> 55:39.465
I couldn't let you do
this all alone.

55:39.467 --> 55:41.499
But it's too dangerous for you.

55:41.501 --> 55:42.699
I know I've been selfish,

55:42.701 --> 55:45.298
but there's nothing
more important to me

55:45.300 --> 55:47.032
than protecting you.

55:47.034 --> 55:49.698
Can you forgive me?

55:51.701 --> 55:53.936
What did you say?

55:59.967 --> 56:01.768
Now let's have an adventure.

56:24.368 --> 56:25.432
We're getting close.

56:25.434 --> 56:26.532
We're coming up on the...

56:26.534 --> 56:29.569
mama mia.

56:35.801 --> 56:36.935
Yay.

56:38.334 --> 56:40.299
Just how are we supposed

56:40.301 --> 56:41.399
to get into that thing?

56:41.401 --> 56:42.498
Through there.

57:03.034 --> 57:04.431
Eww.

57:34.533 --> 57:36.265
Tio,

57:36.267 --> 57:37.532
the core of the mother ship

57:37.534 --> 57:40.266
should be somewhere
beneath you.

57:40.268 --> 57:41.302
Copy that.

57:42.668 --> 57:45.366
This is one small step
for man.

58:05.834 --> 58:08.365
I think I found the core.

58:08.367 --> 58:10.499
Great.
Can you install the virus?

58:10.501 --> 58:12.265
I don't know.

58:12.267 --> 58:14.367
I've never seen
anything like this.

58:16.533 --> 58:17.601
Huh?

58:28.267 --> 58:31.298
So I guess these things
really are universal.

58:31.300 --> 58:32.966
Okay. I'm activating the virus.

58:32.968 --> 58:34.299
Wait, don't,

58:34.301 --> 58:35.965
first we have to save Treme.

58:35.967 --> 58:38.299
The virus will overheat
the core in minutes.

58:38.301 --> 58:39.665
If we activate it now,

58:39.667 --> 58:41.031
we will explode along
with the ship.

58:41.033 --> 58:42.532
Okay. In that case,

58:42.534 --> 58:44.298
let's go find her.

58:44.300 --> 58:45.368
I'll just get off this thing.

58:50.301 --> 58:52.332
Can you guide me to Molosco?

58:52.334 --> 58:53.965
That slime ball
will know where she is.

58:53.967 --> 58:56.266
Uh, I think so.

58:56.268 --> 58:57.798
That shaft connects
to everywhere.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.032
You mean something like
a ventilation shaft?

59:00.034 --> 59:01.735
Well, not exactly.

59:12.667 --> 59:14.431
- Wrong exit.
- Sorry,

59:14.433 --> 59:16.334
take a left
at the next junction.

59:18.268 --> 59:19.435
Keep going.

59:23.600 --> 59:24.765
- Now where?
- Left.

59:27.301 --> 59:28.832
- Go up.
- What do you mean?

59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.602
No, thank you.

01:00:09.768 --> 01:00:11.733
Poor Treme,

01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:13.302
he's conducting
an alien experiment on her.

01:00:25.433 --> 01:00:26.665
A massage?

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:28.531
Oh.

01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:30.366
There's nothing too good

01:00:30.368 --> 01:00:32.431
- for you, my queen.
- Oh,

01:00:32.433 --> 01:00:33.532
right there, Molly.

01:00:33.534 --> 01:00:34.699
- Ooh.
- Back in college,

01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:35.998
I was known as...

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.766
Mr. Magic Puckers.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.765
Somebody save me.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:42.399
Tio, what's going on?

01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:44.865
I think he must be
controlling her mind

01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:46.698
with the amulet.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.865
Hold on, Treme,

01:00:47.867 --> 01:00:49.432
I'm coming.

01:00:49.434 --> 01:00:50.898
You're amazing.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.332
I'm just getting started.

01:00:53.334 --> 01:00:55.598
My eyes, my eyes.

01:01:01.899 --> 01:01:04.432
I have to get amulet.

01:01:04.434 --> 01:01:05.897
Your skin,

01:01:05.899 --> 01:01:07.798
ooh, it's as smooth

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.897
as that of a chicken?

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:12.398
- I am not a chicken.
- Condorito?

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.298
Since when are you an astronaut?

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.834
Since when do you have a job?

01:01:16.899 --> 01:01:18.432
Come on, Treme,

01:01:18.434 --> 01:01:19.799
- you're free.
- I'm free?

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.531
- Free from what?
- The octopus,

01:01:21.533 --> 01:01:22.998
he can't control
your mind anymore.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.698
He's not controlling my mind.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.964
What are you talking about?

01:01:25.966 --> 01:01:26.801
But? But?

01:01:27.933 --> 01:01:30.031
Hah, security,

01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:31.601
security!

01:01:34.634 --> 01:01:37.999
We're, uh,
watching the game.

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:44.999
Arrest this condor.

01:01:54.467 --> 01:01:57.299
Treme, you really
wanna stay here?

01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:58.798
She belongs here.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.331
She's finally the queen
she was destined to be.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:02.499
What about your family,

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:03.931
Cuasi, Yayita?

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.832
This crazy lunatic,

01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:08.498
he's planning to...

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.732
Feel the iron
tentacles' power.

01:02:15.934 --> 01:02:17.732
Tio? Tio?

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.798
Answer me.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.565
Now, now,
come on, fellas,

01:02:26.567 --> 01:02:27.566
there's really no need

01:02:27.568 --> 01:02:29.898
for violence.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.399
Psst, psst,

01:02:31.401 --> 01:02:32.897
take the prisoner
down to the chamber

01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:35.234
of violent incineration.

01:02:43.768 --> 01:02:45.298
What will you do to him?

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.864
Oh, we'll just send him
back to Earth.

01:02:47.866 --> 01:02:49.466
Why don't you wait
right here?

01:02:49.468 --> 01:02:51.202
Be back in a jiffy.

01:02:57.268 --> 01:02:58.965
Emperor Molosco,

01:02:58.967 --> 01:03:01.964
approaching your destination.

01:03:01.966 --> 01:03:04.367
Enslavement protocol
commencing.

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:24.531
I really should have
gotten her the perfume.

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.331
With no updates
from Condorito,

01:03:26.333 --> 01:03:27.931
it appears that the world
as we know it

01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:29.432
will soon be coming
to an end.

01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:30.832
In other news,

01:03:30.834 --> 01:03:32.566
the football season
has been cancelled.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:36.332
Don't worry, dear.

01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:38.399
Condorito
is the smartest chicken

01:03:38.401 --> 01:03:39.632
that I've ever met.

01:03:39.634 --> 01:03:40.932
I bet that even now

01:03:40.934 --> 01:03:42.332
he's kicking their alien asses

01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:44.366
into the next galaxy.

01:03:44.368 --> 01:03:46.599
...civilization.
Officials tell us Earth will...

01:03:52.434 --> 01:03:53.466
Hey, hey,

01:03:53.468 --> 01:03:56.566
hey, hey,

01:03:56.568 --> 01:03:57.765
hey!

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.365
Featherless condor,

01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:00.798
you are hereby charged with

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.299
first degree interruption

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:04.431
- of a massage.
- That's not a thing,

01:04:04.433 --> 01:04:06.398
you slimy invertebrate.

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:14.965
It's not over,
you hear me?

01:04:14.967 --> 01:04:16.531
It's not over.

01:04:16.533 --> 01:04:18.366
Actually, bird,
it is over.

01:04:18.368 --> 01:04:19.998
Time to say <i>adieu.</i>

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.465
Now, prepare
to be incinerated.

01:04:24.467 --> 01:04:25.965
You, too.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.968
Turn up the barbeque!

01:04:35.467 --> 01:04:36.633
Chickie.

01:04:36.635 --> 01:04:37.931
Come in, Chickie.

01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:39.931
Tio, where are you?

01:04:39.933 --> 01:04:41.331
Chickie,
you need to get out

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:42.932
of the mother ship.

01:04:42.934 --> 01:04:44.498
Hold on,
I've got your signal.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.867
On my way.

01:04:50.734 --> 01:04:51.901
Let's go!

01:04:54.699 --> 01:04:55.798
No, there isn't enough time.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.266
I activated the virus.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.798
The whole ship
is going to explode.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.531
Just turn around and go home.

01:05:00.533 --> 01:05:02.798
Please, save yourself
while you can.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.868
But I can rescue you.

01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:10.367
Chickie, listen to me,

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.266
in my whole life,

01:05:15.268 --> 01:05:16.764
I never sacrificed anything

01:05:16.766 --> 01:05:17.964
for the people I love,

01:05:17.966 --> 01:05:19.432
you,

01:05:19.434 --> 01:05:20.565
Yayita,

01:05:20.567 --> 01:05:22.299
everyone.

01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.832
Maybe this is my opportunity

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:26.268
to make up for all that.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.801
But what about you?

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:38.900
Bingo.

01:05:40.767 --> 01:05:42.498
Auto return sequence initiated.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.664
What's going on?

01:05:43.666 --> 01:05:45.265
It's all right.

01:05:45.267 --> 01:05:46.765
- You'll be safe now.
- Tio.

01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:48.598
No.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.832
Tell Yayita...

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:51.268
I love her.

01:05:52.468 --> 01:05:55.331
Tio.

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:58.498
Hey,
have some adventures for me.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.532
Anyone want some fries

01:06:17.534 --> 01:06:19.701
with their condor nuggets?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.366
Hold all my calls.

01:06:29.368 --> 01:06:30.531
I'm going to celebrate

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:31.897
with my empress.

01:06:31.899 --> 01:06:34.631
But my Lord, the invasion starts
in 20 minutes.

01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:35.698
That's all right.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.267
I'm only going to need four.

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.567
Huh?

01:06:48.367 --> 01:06:49.502
Take me home.

01:06:54.867 --> 01:06:56.564
So where's your ship?

01:06:56.566 --> 01:06:58.897
I sent it back to earth.

01:06:58.899 --> 01:07:00.897
Wait.

01:07:00.899 --> 01:07:02.564
- What?
- Chickie was on it.

01:07:02.566 --> 01:07:04.732
That was the only way
to make sure he got home safe.

01:07:04.734 --> 01:07:06.632
Chickie?

01:07:06.634 --> 01:07:07.832
Well, then exactly

01:07:07.834 --> 01:07:09.331
how are we supposed
to get home?

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:11.897
Uh, Uber?

01:07:11.899 --> 01:07:13.864
How about
the escape pods?

01:07:13.866 --> 01:07:16.498
- Where are they?
- Top floor.

01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:23.831
Hurry up.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:25.031
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:07:25.033 --> 01:07:26.665
What's your problem?

01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:28.731
Oh, right.
I forgot to tell you.

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:31.465
Promise you won't get mad?

01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:32.731
<i>Mi amor,</i>

01:07:32.733 --> 01:07:35.697
come and get your emperor.

01:07:35.699 --> 01:07:37.031
Huh?

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.331
I'll be back soon.

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.032
Why don't you just wait
right here for me,

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.497
winky smoochy face.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.398
Oh, mamacita!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.598
This whole ship's gonna blow?!

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.801
You promised you
wouldn't get mad!

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.565
<i>♪ Where, where's my lunchbox? ♪</i>

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:03.731
<i>♪ Lunch, lunchbox,
where's my, my lunchbox ♪</i>

01:08:03.733 --> 01:08:05.731
<i>♪ Where's my lunch,
lunch, lunchbox? ♪</i>

01:08:05.733 --> 01:08:07.764
<i>♪ Where's my lunch, computer? ♪</i>

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:11.732
<i>♪ Where's my lunch,

01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:13.265
<i>♪ Computer, lunchbox? ♪</i>

01:08:16.934 --> 01:08:18.701
Huh?

01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:21.867
Your Majesty.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.301
The escape pods.

01:08:36.733 --> 01:08:39.732
We just need to get to them
without causing a panic.

01:08:39.734 --> 01:08:41.365
Panic, panic,

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:42.698
floor overheating.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.464
Total devastation
in five minutes.

01:08:46.767 --> 01:08:48.865
This is just a drill.

01:08:48.867 --> 01:08:50.698
This is not a drill.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.299
Well, at least

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:55.430
there are plenty
of escape pods.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:57.032
No, there aren't.

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:57.935
Run, birdbrain, run!

01:09:12.433 --> 01:09:14.999
That robot is a chicken!

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:24.798
Ahh.

01:09:25.966 --> 01:09:27.567
Ooh.

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.497
Why yes,

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:33.831
I have been working out.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:37.665
How dare you barge in on me?

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:39.564
But my Lord, I didn't mean to.

01:09:39.567 --> 01:09:41.032
Slap yourself
in the face at once.

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:42.831
My Lord, it's...

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:44.698
an emergency!

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.529
- Ow!
- Huh?

01:09:52.268 --> 01:09:54.497
Majesty, step away
from the chicken

01:09:54.499 --> 01:09:56.464
- or we will shoot!
- Get us out of here!

01:09:56.466 --> 01:09:57.664
Here goes nothing!

01:10:15.366 --> 01:10:17.397
Kiss my feathers.

01:10:17.399 --> 01:10:18.464
Kiss my feathers.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.533
Well, I didn't see that coming.

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:42.867
Any other ideas?

01:10:44.399 --> 01:10:45.800
I do have one.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.431
Nice.

01:10:50.433 --> 01:10:51.698
Now let's get out of here.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.798
Computer,
where's our escape pod?

01:10:56.499 --> 01:10:57.501
Son of a...

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:11.697
That tickles,

01:11:11.699 --> 01:11:12.964
I'm stuck in something.

01:11:12.966 --> 01:11:13.965
Inhale.

01:11:22.267 --> 01:11:23.864
It's all my fault.

01:11:23.866 --> 01:11:24.932
I should've left

01:11:24.934 --> 01:11:26.797
when you first said to leave.

01:11:26.799 --> 01:11:28.697
No, you're here
because of me.

01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:30.431
It's my fault.

01:11:31.767 --> 01:11:33.598
I'm sorry.

01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:40.698
Did you throw up in here?

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.831
Ugh.

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:44.031
- What's that?
- Hey,

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.931
anybody need a ride?

01:11:45.933 --> 01:11:47.330
Chickie?

01:11:47.332 --> 01:11:48.698
But how?

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.631
I ejected the pilot.

01:11:50.633 --> 01:11:52.664
Chickie,
you have to rescue us.

01:11:52.666 --> 01:11:54.732
The mother ship
is going to explode.

01:11:54.734 --> 01:11:55.900
Already on it.

01:11:58.733 --> 01:12:00.032
Now tell me
that's not

01:12:00.034 --> 01:12:01.467
the most beautiful sight ever.

01:12:04.633 --> 01:12:06.964
- Huh?
- Do not put your faith

01:12:06.966 --> 01:12:09.897
in beauty...

01:12:09.899 --> 01:12:11.297
because beauty lies.

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:12.564
Let go of us.

01:12:12.566 --> 01:12:14.565
I would've given you everything.

01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:16.031
Believe me, I would rather die

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:17.865
than be with a monster like you.

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:19.466
Then here's your wish.

01:12:26.967 --> 01:12:27.901
Chickie.

01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:30.931
Chickie, are you all right?

01:12:30.933 --> 01:12:32.397
Yeah.

01:12:32.399 --> 01:12:34.032
Just a little dizzy.

01:12:34.034 --> 01:12:35.365
You twisted maniac.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.998
You're wasting your time.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.964
Nice shot.

01:12:55.899 --> 01:12:57.032
Now let's finish this.

01:13:00.599 --> 01:13:01.598
Whoa.

01:13:04.834 --> 01:13:06.965
Stop, just wait.

01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.865
Huh, now you're really twisted.

01:13:12.867 --> 01:13:14.731
Enough, Tremebunda,

01:13:14.733 --> 01:13:17.530
remove your helmet now.

01:13:17.532 --> 01:13:19.032
No, don't do it.

01:13:19.034 --> 01:13:20.397
Don't listen to him.

01:13:22.933 --> 01:13:24.831
Get off of me, bird boy.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:27.864
Tell Treme to stop.

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:28.965
No, Treme.

01:13:28.967 --> 01:13:30.397
Give it up, kid.

01:13:30.399 --> 01:13:32.998
My security code is unbreakable.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.531
Is it circle, triangle,

01:13:34.533 --> 01:13:36.497
squiggle face, spider?

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.397
- How did you know that?
- There's a post-it.

01:13:38.399 --> 01:13:39.565
No, no, no, no, no,

01:13:39.567 --> 01:13:40.733
no, Mommy.

01:13:47.867 --> 01:13:48.964
Oh.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:49.968
Huh?

01:13:52.966 --> 01:13:55.430
- What happened?
- It's no biggie.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.865
You just tried to kill us

01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:58.465
but it's all good.

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:04.364
You both are already dead.

01:14:04.366 --> 01:14:06.698
Good luck outrunning that,

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.500
birdbrain.

01:14:20.299 --> 01:14:22.266
What are you looking
at me for?

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.430
No. This is an executive pod.

01:14:31.432 --> 01:14:33.667
You're getting
space everywhere.

01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:37.330
Hmm.

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.935
Huh?

01:14:41.833 --> 01:14:43.832
Tio, I'm scared.

01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:44.935
It's gonna be all right.

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:06.931
Look, it's Pelotillehue.

01:15:06.933 --> 01:15:08.697
Our inertial dampeners

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:09.897
are down to two percent.

01:15:09.899 --> 01:15:11.732
Can you land this thing?

01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:13.397
Maybe, but where?

01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:14.797
I want you to cancel
the orphanage

01:15:14.799 --> 01:15:18.330
and get me a first-class ticket
to Mars now!

01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:21.565
Huh?

01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:22.667
<i>Amigos!</i>

01:15:24.766 --> 01:15:26.731
- Look over here!
- No!

01:15:26.733 --> 01:15:27.864
Not the car!

01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:28.868
No!

01:15:31.867 --> 01:15:33.301
My baby! Please!

01:15:39.899 --> 01:15:42.331
Ha! You missed me!

01:16:02.599 --> 01:16:06.264
Yeah!

01:16:06.266 --> 01:16:09.598
We can now officially
confirm that Earth

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.398
and with it,
the rest of the football season

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.765
has been saved!

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:15.030
My darling,

01:16:15.032 --> 01:16:17.364
I thought I lost you forever.

01:16:17.366 --> 01:16:19.634
You should be so lucky.

01:16:24.899 --> 01:16:25.934
Oh, Mom.

01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:32.397
Condorito!

01:16:32.399 --> 01:16:33.764
You're back!

01:16:33.766 --> 01:16:35.265
- Hey, guys.
- Did you get us anything?

01:16:35.267 --> 01:16:37.632
Of course I did.

01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:40.764
Who wants to play with
an alien artifact?

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.932
It's confirmed, ma'am.

01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:48.931
The mothership has been
completely destroyed.

01:16:48.933 --> 01:16:50.464
And the amulet?

01:16:50.466 --> 01:16:52.465
There's no trace of it
on the scan.

01:16:52.467 --> 01:16:54.998
- Professor?
- Yay!

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.497
Finally, a real alien
to dissect!

01:16:57.499 --> 01:16:58.598
Dissect?!

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.964
These tentacles are fascinating.

01:17:01.966 --> 01:17:03.497
Hmm.

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:05.265
That one isn't a tentacle.

01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:12.398
Where you going?

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.597
You were right.

01:17:13.599 --> 01:17:15.030
Yayita deserves a prince,

01:17:15.032 --> 01:17:16.833
not a birdbrain.

01:17:20.299 --> 01:17:21.798
Yes, but sometimes

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.697
even a birdbrain

01:17:22.699 --> 01:17:24.567
can be a prince.

01:17:27.032 --> 01:17:28.297
Go to her,

01:17:28.299 --> 01:17:29.400
you nitwit.

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:33.897
Yayita,

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.963
I just wanted to say

01:17:35.965 --> 01:17:37.631
if it wasn't for you,

01:17:37.633 --> 01:17:40.632
I wouldn't have made it back.

01:17:40.634 --> 01:17:42.732
You were the light
that guided me home.

01:17:42.734 --> 01:17:44.565
Aww.

01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:46.930
I know I don't
have much, but...

01:17:46.932 --> 01:17:47.966
Yayita...

01:17:49.733 --> 01:17:51.497
will you marry me?

01:17:51.499 --> 01:17:53.433
Aww.

01:17:54.932 --> 01:17:57.365
- No.
- Aww. Huh?

01:17:57.367 --> 01:17:58.632
Condorito,

01:17:58.634 --> 01:18:00.631
you know how much you mean to me

01:18:00.633 --> 01:18:02.464
but it's just too soon

01:18:02.466 --> 01:18:03.832
for us to get married.

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:05.465
I'm not ready.

01:18:05.467 --> 01:18:07.798
So that means
there's no wedding?

01:18:09.899 --> 01:18:12.297
The only thing I want from you

01:18:12.299 --> 01:18:14.300
is right here.

01:18:15.766 --> 01:18:17.930
You are the most amazing woman

01:18:17.932 --> 01:18:19.667
in the universe!

01:18:23.467 --> 01:18:24.963
Woo-hoo!

01:18:44.799 --> 01:18:47.533
Pepe! Pepe! Pepe! Pepe!

01:18:50.033 --> 01:18:51.697
Thank you, thank you.

01:18:51.699 --> 01:18:53.631
Now, many of you
must be wondering,

01:18:53.633 --> 01:18:54.863
Pepe Cortisona,

01:18:54.865 --> 01:18:56.664
why are you throwing
your money away

01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:59.465
on something as worthless
as needy children?

01:18:59.467 --> 01:19:01.401
Well, all I can say is...

01:19:03.999 --> 01:19:06.597
I have the butt of a donkey.

01:19:08.367 --> 01:19:10.863
Uh, excuse me.

01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:12.964
What I meant to say is...

01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.431
Honey, don't you think

01:19:18.433 --> 01:19:19.900
you've punished Pepe enough?

01:19:24.433 --> 01:19:26.464
Not really.

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:43.601
Here you go.

01:19:48.933 --> 01:19:50.431
Yes, yes, don't worry.

01:19:50.433 --> 01:19:51.799
I'll add you on WhatsApp.

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:05.934
What's going on?

01:20:08.634 --> 01:20:10.631
Oh, no. No,

01:20:10.633 --> 01:20:12.365
no, no. Oh, please.

01:20:12.367 --> 01:20:14.465
Tell me I did not pay
for all of this.

01:20:14.467 --> 01:20:17.397
Lead Sack,
you've been very generous.

01:20:17.399 --> 01:20:18.764
And in return,
the kids have done

01:20:18.766 --> 01:20:20.565
something for you.
They all worked together

01:20:20.567 --> 01:20:22.398
to repair...

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.631
your beloved...

01:20:23.633 --> 01:20:25.565
automobile.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.830
Whee, whee.

01:20:29.832 --> 01:20:31.698
Uh, I guess it's now

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.832
more of an auto-immobile.
