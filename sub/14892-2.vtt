Good vegetables, Jen.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.196
Thanks.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.832
They’re, they’re so...crisp.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.905
Well, I did, uh,
keep them in the crisper.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.374
Well, that, uh,
that must be it.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.511
Balki, could you, uh,
please pass the salt?

01:52.412 --> 01:53.446
Balki?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.616
Balki?

Balki?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.694
Would you please
pass the salt?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.404
Thank you.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.577
Sorry, cousin, we were playing
lip tag and I was it.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.416
Tonight is
the fourth anniversary

02:30.450 --> 02:33.954
of the very first time we ever
said the exact same thing

02:33.987 --> 02:35.556
at the exact same time.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.860
Well, who, who could blame you
for celebrating?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.264
Cuddle break.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.242
What is it with those two?

02:57.744 --> 03:00.514
It’s, it’s a cuddle break
every fifteen minutes.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.451
I mean, have you ever seen
anything so nauseating?

03:05.485 --> 03:06.787
I think they’re adorable.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.822
You do?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.290
Yeah, I think it’s sweet the way

03:10.323 --> 03:11.892
they’re so affectionate
with each other.

03:12.759 --> 03:13.994
You do?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.596
I feel like going to bed.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.698
You do?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.909
Goodnight, Balki.
Goodnight, Mary Anne.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.344
I’ll just, uh, lock the doors
and be right up sweetheart.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.212
Why?

03:32.245 --> 03:34.380
Because you said
you wanted to go to bed.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.383
Oh, right, try not to disturb me
when you come upstairs, okay?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.523
They’re so cute.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.592
Race you to the pillow.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.505
‐Balki?
‐Yeah.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.776
Ordinarily I wouldn’t come
to you with a problem like this.

04:02.809 --> 04:06.246
Uh, but you seem
to be doing something right.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.016
So, uh, tell me.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.718
How do you...

04:11.752 --> 04:14.054
...keep the old...

04:14.087 --> 04:16.389
...home fires, burning?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.463
Gotcha.

04:23.496 --> 04:28.068
Well, cousin, the, um,
the most important thing

04:28.101 --> 04:31.838
is to use very,
very dry wood.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.580
But the real key
is the kindling.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.383
And, of course,
the lighter fluid.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.718
Now, if you just go through
a little bota bag‐‐

04:44.751 --> 04:47.588
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.992
I’m talking about
the fires

04:52.025 --> 04:54.861
between a man
and a woman.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.531
Oh.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.000
‐Oh...them fires.
‐Yeah.

05:04.070 --> 05:08.374
If our flame ever flickered,
I think what I would do

05:08.408 --> 05:11.578
I would go into my
pleasure chest and select

05:11.612 --> 05:15.348
one of the three tried and true
Bartokomous marriage secrets.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.786
"Three tried and true
Bartokomous marriage secrets?"

05:20.587 --> 05:21.822
What are they?

05:21.855 --> 05:25.491
Well, cousin, uh, if I told you
they wouldn’t be secrets.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.395
I’ll buy you ice cream.

05:29.429 --> 05:30.631
Moon oil is one.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.835
Burning amber incense
is another.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.437
And, of course, there’s
the Ocean Surf cassette tape.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.941
Goodnight, cousin.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.410
‐Uh, just out of curiosity.
‐Uh‐huh.

05:44.444 --> 05:48.481
Um, where is, uh,
your pleasure chest?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.850
Well, cousin, now again

05:49.883 --> 05:52.786
that would be another
Bartokomous marriage secret.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.288

05:55.321 --> 05:57.157
In the garage behind
my cheese wheel.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.625
Thank you.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.293
Why do you ask?

06:00.326 --> 06:02.929
Oh, you know, no reasons.
Just, uh, you know guy talk.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.999
Oh, hey!
Look at the time.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.400
Hey, you better get to bed,
don’t you think?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.538
I don’t know, cousin, you kinda
got me in the mood to talk.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.541
So anyway,
how’s everything by you?

06:14.575 --> 06:15.676
‐Balki.
‐Uh‐huh.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.513
Go to bed, Mary Anne is waiting.
Cuddle break, remember?

06:20.747 --> 06:23.149
Cousin, I got to be
honest with you.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.386
The woman is
wearing me out.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.491
(Mary Anne)
’Balki.’

06:31.525 --> 06:33.960
On the other hand, she sure
knows how to toss my salad!

06:36.229 --> 06:37.497
Goodnight, cousin.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.969
[instrumental music]

06:52.045 --> 06:53.514
Good morning, cousin.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.981
Would you like
a fish head omelet?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.720
No.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.187
Would you like
a knuckle sandwich?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.125
Knuckles are more
of a lunch thing.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.662
They tend to stay with you‐‐

07:08.695 --> 07:09.763
Listen to me.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.131
Besides, they,
they repeat on me.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.100
Listen to me,
listen to me.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.170
Because of you, Jennifer is
miserable this morning.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.175
I went into your stupid pleasure
chest, I used your stupid

07:22.208 --> 07:24.878
Bartokomous marriage secrets
and they didn’t work.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.015
You went into my
pleasure chest?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.684
‐Yes.
‐What you did take?

07:30.717 --> 07:32.485
I took ’em all!

07:32.519 --> 07:34.988
The moon oil gave her a rash,
she’s still sneezing

07:35.021 --> 07:38.124
from the incense, and the ocean
sounds made her seasick.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.897
Before I report you
to the proper authorities

07:43.930 --> 07:45.699
there’s something
I think you should know.

07:48.935 --> 07:52.539
Moon oil applied
directly to the skin

07:52.573 --> 07:54.641
usually causes
third degree burns!

07:56.276 --> 07:57.944
Ow.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.749
You must have found
an old bottle.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.019
But, the, the moon oil
isn’t body oil?

08:06.052 --> 08:09.623
Moon oil is used to light
the Myposian honeymoon lamp

08:09.656 --> 08:12.292
and the incense is for
outdoor use only

08:12.325 --> 08:13.827
and no one
should ever listen

08:13.860 --> 08:16.196
to the Ocean Surf cassette tape
on a full stomach.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.933
And in case
you haven’t noticed

08:19.966 --> 08:22.503
Jennifer has
a very full stomach.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.683
Jen, honey, you,
you feel better?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.120
It’s funny, Larry.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.922
Until last night
I didn’t think anything

08:41.955 --> 08:44.691
could make me feel more
miserable than being pregnant.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.693
I was wrong.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.936
Let’s get going, this is gonna
take a major league gift.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.939
‐May I make a suggestion?
‐Yeah.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.774
A Louisville slug?

09:04.611 --> 09:06.780
A little garlic on it,
delicious.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
(male #1 in store)
’Thank you for shopping
at Peterman’s.’

09:23.730 --> 09:26.933
’Remember, Peterman’s white sale
starts Monday.’

09:26.967 --> 09:28.101
Come on, let’s go.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.135
Cousin, just,
just wait a minute.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.138
I, I want to find
something special for Mary Anne.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.908
Balki, you already got a,
a car full of gifts.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.778
Wha‐wha‐what is this?
Another anniversary?

09:37.811 --> 09:40.380
Today is the first anniversary
of the first time that

09:40.413 --> 09:42.248
Mary Anne and I
got caught in the rain

09:42.282 --> 09:44.084
and our hair got all wet
and stringy

09:44.117 --> 09:45.786
and we used the car heater
to dry it

09:45.819 --> 09:47.888
and got our heads stuck
under the steering wheel.

09:51.391 --> 09:55.195
Well, that must have been
a special, special day for you.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.000
And I’d love to hear
more about it.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.636
Well, we got caught
in the rain‐‐

10:02.669 --> 10:04.270
But...

10:04.304 --> 10:06.773
And our, our hair was all wet
and, and stringy‐‐

10:06.807 --> 10:10.310
But, but, but, I have to find

10:10.343 --> 10:12.145
the perfect gift for Jenifer.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.346
Cousin, what are you
talking about?

10:13.379 --> 10:17.150
We’ve been shopping all day
and the little neck pillow

10:17.183 --> 10:18.919
that you got six
and a half hours ago

10:18.952 --> 10:20.887
remains the perfect gift.
And why?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.756
Because it’s what
she really wants.

10:22.789 --> 10:26.426
Balki, it’s cheap, it’s stupid
and it’s too small.

10:26.459 --> 10:30.764
Cousin, if a gift is given
with love, size don’t count.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.199
Believe me, size always counts.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.038
(male #1)
’Attention, shoppers, the store
will close in five minutes.’

10:38.071 --> 10:39.673
’Five minutes till closing.’

10:39.706 --> 10:40.874
Come on, cousin,
let’s get out of here.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.008
They’re closing the store.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.044
‐No, they’re not.
‐Yeah, they are.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.747
They just, he just said, "The
store closing in five minutes."

10:46.780 --> 10:50.416
It’s just a trick
to encourage impulse buying.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.720
It amazes me how you can find
the ugliest motives

10:53.754 --> 10:54.955
in the simplest things.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.192
It’s what I do best.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.927
Now let’s go back
to the jewelry department.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.262
Okay.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.463
Cousin, the jewelry
is right around that corner‐‐

11:03.496 --> 11:05.365
‐It’s right over here.
‐It’s right around the corner.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.067
Cousin, remember,
look, look...

11:07.100 --> 11:08.134
Just turn and look.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.778
‐Well, now you’ve done it.
‐Well, now you’ve done it.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.212
‐What do you mean I’ve done it?
‐What do you mean I’ve done it?

11:19.245 --> 11:20.280
‐What are you talking about?
‐The jewelry department...

11:20.313 --> 11:22.148
‐Is right over there.
‐Look, if you’d just...

11:22.182 --> 11:24.818
You have no visual memory.
No visual memory at all.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.920
[indistinct arguing]

11:26.953 --> 11:29.455

Well, I can’t believe you’re
gonna wriggle out of this again.

Just help me put
this thing back together

11:39.132 --> 11:41.234
before the security guard
sees us.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.435
‐Okay.
‐Umm.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.113
Look, cousin

11:53.146 --> 11:54.815
he’s got his foot
in his mouth.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.523
Will you stop
fooling around?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.991
Oh, I’m sorry,
cousin, here

12:05.025 --> 12:06.259
let me give you a hand.

are you?

Will you stop it?

13:53.534 --> 13:54.935
‐Hey, cousin...
‐Umm?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.138
You do notice
anything strange?

14:00.006 --> 14:03.309
Other than the fact that
I’m torn between two dummies?

14:05.111 --> 14:06.412
Feeling like a fool?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.983
Cousin

14:10.016 --> 14:12.085
it’s awfully quiet
in here.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.521
You know what I think?

14:18.158 --> 14:19.526
You know what?

14:21.127 --> 14:23.396
You know,
you know what I think?

14:23.429 --> 14:25.198
I think everybody
gone home.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.270
‐Cousin...
‐Hmm?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.873
They closed the store.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.441
Impossible.

14:40.681 --> 14:42.516
[door rumbling]

14:53.694 --> 14:55.161
Balki, they closed
the store.

14:57.097 --> 15:01.267
You stupid little
nincompoopolos.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.236
Oh, so now, suddenly,
I’m the one to blame.

15:03.269 --> 15:06.540
Oh, no, you were pretty much
always the one to blame.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.675
Well, l‐look,
let’s just concentrate

15:08.709 --> 15:11.011
on finding a way
outta here.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.046
But don’t worry, cousin.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.082
I have a plan.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.618
‐Oh, oh, you have a plan?
‐Yeah.

15:17.651 --> 15:18.952
‐I have a plan.
‐You have a plan?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.253
‐A good one too.
‐No.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.223
No, no,
no‐no‐no‐no‐no‐no‐no!

15:24.691 --> 15:28.529
I make the plans
and you follow.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.397
Engine, caboose.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.368
Engine...caboose.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.205
‐Got it?
‐Yeah, I got it.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.642
No one blows hot air
like you do.

15:47.548 --> 15:50.517
I think, I’ll just use
the phone to call for help.

15:50.551 --> 15:53.119
[dog barking]

15:54.287 --> 15:56.089
Cousin...

15:56.122 --> 15:57.290
Did you hear something?

15:57.323 --> 15:58.358
Yes, I heard something.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.760
[dog snarling]

15:59.793 --> 16:00.894
Must have been
a recording.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.297
Probably a motion detector
and a speaker around here.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.667
[dog snarling]

16:06.700 --> 16:10.036
You know, all the big stores
are going with these

16:10.070 --> 16:12.038
high‐tech alarm systems.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.441
Cousin. Cousin...

16:15.475 --> 16:18.044
It’s, it’s, it’s a dog.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.214
Of course, it’s a dog.
It’s a recording of a dog.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.149
And not a very good one,
I might add.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.251
[snarling]

16:27.688 --> 16:32.325
No, cousin,
it’s a big scary dog.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.227
I know you’re scared.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.630
It’s your first time
locked in a store.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.699
But Cousin Larry is here.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.337
I’m not gonna let anything
happen to you, okay?

16:44.370 --> 16:45.639
You feel better?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.140
Huh? Feel better?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.142
[dog snarling]

16:54.447 --> 16:55.749
Why didn’t you tell me?

16:55.782 --> 16:58.218
I tried to tell you,
but you were too busy making‐‐

16:58.251 --> 16:59.285
[dog barks]

16:59.319 --> 17:01.354
Making me feel better,
feel better.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.490
Just for the record,
I don’t.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.829
Alright, Balki,
don’t make any sudden moves.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.464
We’re going to back up
very, very slowly.

17:13.634 --> 17:15.401
[snarling]

17:15.435 --> 17:17.538
[barking]

17:20.874 --> 17:22.108
[barking continues]

17:25.310 --> 17:26.813
[barking continues]

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
Cousin, I think he wants us
to stand still.

17:32.653 --> 17:33.787
Okay, okay!

17:34.821 --> 17:38.191
Alright, I think
we need a plan.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.593
‐Alright, let me think.
‐I got it.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.261
I got it, I got it, I got it.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.130
Listen up. Listen up.
I got it.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.732
You let the dog chase you
around the store

17:45.766 --> 17:47.167
while I make
the phone call.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.869
On three, ready?
One, two, three.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.170
Go.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.472
[dog growling]

17:52.506 --> 17:53.640
One, two, three, go.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.576
Balki, go.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.612
One, two, three, go.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.780
Go, go.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.548
One‐two‐three. Go.

18:04.785 --> 18:07.487
What else you got?

18:07.521 --> 18:10.490
Nice doggy. Nice doggy.
Nice doggy. Stay. Stay. Stay.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.625
‐Stay.
‐Cousin, cousin.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.226
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.261
Here you go. Here you go, doggy.
Fetch.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.730
‐’No, cousin.’
‐’Here you go. Here you go.’

18:16.763 --> 18:19.499
Fetch. Here you go,
here you go, doggy. Fetch.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.801
‐No, cousin.
‐Here you go. Here you go.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.168
Doggy, just, just go.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.505
Balki.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.740
What kinda doggy
doesn’t fetch?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.409
A dog that would
rather kill.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.412
Cousin, if I don’t make it
out of here... Oh, God.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.380
If, if I don’t make it out
of here alive

18:34.414 --> 18:37.250
tell Mary Anne that, um, that
I stashed some extra cash

18:37.283 --> 18:41.354
behind the nutmeg in the kitchen
and that I love her very much.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.524
Why am I telling you this?
You’ll be dead, too.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.792
Balki, I know about
your nutmeg stash.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.461
And, listen, if we do
get out of here alive

18:48.494 --> 18:50.797
I‐I’m gonna give you back the
three hundred dollars I stole.

18:50.831 --> 18:52.332
[dog barking]

18:52.365 --> 18:54.701
You stole my nutmeg
nest egg?

18:55.736 --> 18:57.403
How could you do that?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.839
How can you do that to me?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.441
[barking continues]

19:01.474 --> 19:03.677
[instrumental music]

19:03.710 --> 19:05.178
Oh‐oh.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.182
[dog barking]

19:10.684 --> 19:12.519
Enough, enough.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.261
(Jennifer)
Where would they be all night
without calling us?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.696
Maybe they wanted to
earn some extra money

19:22.729 --> 19:24.631
for our babies’
college education

19:24.665 --> 19:26.800
so they took second jobs
and forgot to tell us.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.571
Or maybe they’re lying
in a ditch somewhere.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.840
See that’s the difference
between us.

19:33.874 --> 19:35.842
You see the glass
and you say it’s half empty

19:35.876 --> 19:38.845
whereas I see the glass
and I say it’s empty halfway.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.920
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.691
Balki, what happened to you?

19:50.724 --> 19:51.792
Larry, where have you been?

19:51.825 --> 19:53.794
I’ve been worried sick.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.328
Well, we accidentally
got locked

19:55.361 --> 19:57.964
in Peterman’s department store
with a mad dog.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.867
Larry, I promise
I won’t be angry.

20:00.901 --> 20:01.968
Where have you
really been?

20:04.270 --> 20:05.739
Jennifer, it’s true.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.642
We were, we were being chased
all night by a dog.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.243
But the worst part was...

20:11.044 --> 20:13.279
...they locked
the bathrooms.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.885
Well, you missed a pretty
special anniversary.

20:18.919 --> 20:20.621
No, I didn’t,
my little lamb shank.

20:24.024 --> 20:26.560
You remembered the first time
we got caught in the rain

20:26.593 --> 20:27.894
and our hair got
all wet and stringy

20:27.928 --> 20:29.663
and we used the car heater
to dry it

20:29.696 --> 20:32.533
and got our heads caught under
the steering wheel anniversary.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.404
I have your present upstairs.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.607
Cuddle break.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.951
Penny for your thoughts.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.419
[mellow music]

20:53.453 --> 20:56.923
Larry, how did you get locked
in Peterman’s department store?

20:56.957 --> 21:00.393
Well, well, I‐I was just trying
to find the perfect gift for you

21:00.426 --> 21:03.730
to save our marriage
and we got locked in.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.666
Larry, our marriage
doesn’t need saving.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.602
And why would you
think it would?

21:08.635 --> 21:13.039
Well, well, you, you don’t seem
to be interested in me lately

21:13.073 --> 21:16.309
I mean, Balki and Mary Anne are
always taking cuddle breaks

21:16.342 --> 21:19.780
and, and, and, you, you just
you, you don’t want to touch me.

21:19.813 --> 21:21.815
I’m sorry, Larry,
but these days

21:21.848 --> 21:23.950
I just don’t feel
very attractive.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.954
Well, you, you’ve never been
more attractive.

21:28.822 --> 21:30.691
‐Really?
‐Yes.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.993
‐You mean it?
‐Yes, I mean it.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.729
Oh, Larry,
I love you.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.467
Ow, ow.

21:41.502 --> 21:44.437
The, the dog nicked
my lip.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.009
Oh, and I,
I almost forgot.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.644
This is, uh, for you.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.846
And it’s small and cheap

21:52.879 --> 21:54.715
but it’s the only thing
I could find.

21:56.617 --> 21:57.884
I love surprises.

21:57.918 --> 21:58.952
It’s a neck pillow.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.527
Oh, Larry,
I love it.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.562
When my lip heals,
I’ll, I’ll blow it up for you.

22:10.631 --> 22:12.032
Cuddle break?

22:12.065 --> 22:14.801
[instrumental music]

22:23.844 --> 22:24.878
Uh‐uh, uh‐uh.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.013
[dog barking]

22:27.047 --> 22:28.815
[dog snarls]

22:32.118 --> 22:35.021
Balki...wh‐why isn’t he
chasing you?

22:35.055 --> 22:36.422
I don’t know, cousin.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.624
I grew up on a farm.

22:37.658 --> 22:40.493
I just have a way with animals.
Isn’t that right, boy?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.896
[dog barking]

22:42.929 --> 22:44.831
Oh, oh. Uh‐ah. Oh, oh‐oh.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.504
[both shouting]

22:55.609 --> 22:58.411
[theme music]
