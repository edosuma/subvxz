00:03.500 --> 00:07.125
(J.D.) <i>I was super-psyched to get</i>
<i>my scooter Sasha back from the shop,</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:10.333
<i>but my new scooter insurance</i>
<i>hadn't kicked in yet,</i>

00:10.417 --> 00:12.166
<i>so I was being extra-cautious.</i>

00:12.250 --> 00:13.375
(sirens approaching)

00:13.458 --> 00:16.500
Perfect.
Time for my morning Slushee.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.750
(tires skid)

00:19.333 --> 00:21.917
Get out the way!
The store's being robbed!

00:22.959 --> 00:23.917
Freeze!

00:26.291 --> 00:28.625
The wall!
Hide behind the wall!

00:30.750 --> 00:31.667
No!

00:33.250 --> 00:35.709
(shooting)

00:38.959 --> 00:40.625
Sasha!

00:40.709 --> 00:43.709
All right! All right! Ok.

00:43.792 --> 00:46.667
There was a wall!
What's the matter with you?!

00:46.750 --> 00:49.208
(bang-bang)

00:49.291 --> 00:52.125
Who's still shooting?
She's down!

00:52.208 --> 00:53.750
(bang)

00:53.834 --> 00:55.166
It's over.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.083
Is this gonna hurt?

00:59.166 --> 01:02.375
Oh, don't be such a baby.
It's a magnetic image.

01:02.458 --> 01:05.000
I apologize,
Mr. Foster. I'm a little upset.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.709
My scooter Sasha was assassinated
this morning.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.166
Yeah, he was so attached
to that thing

01:09.250 --> 01:11.750
he used to wear a bracelet
that said, "Sasha forever."

01:11.834 --> 01:14.000
Oh, come on, Turk.
It was just a joke.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.500
And I only wore it for one week.

01:15.583 --> 01:16.583
Whatever.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.500
Now let's fire this baby up.

01:18.583 --> 01:21.834
-(whirring)
-(thunk)

01:21.917 --> 01:23.834
Ok, so I still wear
the bracelet.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.333
Idiot.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.333
Oh! My watch.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.834
-Hey, Carla!
-Earphones, Ted!

01:33.917 --> 01:38.041
Sorry. Hey, Carla, did you hear
the lottery's up to 100 million?

01:38.125 --> 01:42.375
If I win that baby, it's separate
beds for me and my mom.

01:42.458 --> 01:47.291
Yeah, and you can spend
the other 99,999,000 on therapy.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.375
What would you
do with the money?

01:51.125 --> 01:53.709
Carla, I can't believe
you're gonna be a mom.

01:53.792 --> 01:58.041
I know. It was expensive,
but totally worth it.

01:58.125 --> 02:02.083
-Right, baby?
-Stupid lotto.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.709
Good morning, Mrs. Wilk.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.125
Great morning,
isn't it?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.834
(gasps) Whoa, that is wrong.

02:09.917 --> 02:11.875
Care to join me
in a super loud throat clear?

02:11.959 --> 02:15.375
-Absolutely.
-1, 2, 3.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.291
-Ahem!
-Ahem!

02:22.041 --> 02:24.208
Elliot,
I can't believe you would do that.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.667
-What'd you do?
-Was it naughty?

02:26.792 --> 02:28.875
(J.D.) <i>When women want</i>
<i>men to completely zone out,</i>

02:28.959 --> 02:31.250
<i>there's always one thing</i>
<i>they can talk about.</i>

02:31.333 --> 02:33.667
See, yesterday I went shoe shopping,
and there was this one pair of

02:33.750 --> 02:34.625
Manholo Blahniks...

02:34.709 --> 02:36.166
(both, thinking) <i>Shoe shopping.</i>

02:36.250 --> 02:37.875
that were, like, super cute.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.417
Great. We can talk.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.792
-What were you thinking?
-So? We kissed.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.333
I've been treating his kid
for a week now,

02:43.417 --> 02:44.709
and we just really hit it off.
You know.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.542
I mean, it started out with
some pretty innocent flirting.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.208
"Hi. I'm Dr. Reid." "Why is there
blood in my son's stool?"

02:50.834 --> 02:52.083
-Huh?
-Whose stool?

02:52.166 --> 02:53.208
Strappy sandals.

02:53.291 --> 02:56.458
(both, thinking) <i>Shoe shopping.</i>

02:56.542 --> 02:57.875
Continue.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.542
And I asked where his wife was.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.458
He said, "she's not with us,"

03:02.542 --> 03:04.500
and then, you know...

03:05.667 --> 03:07.208
bleh.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.834
Cool. Oh, I almost forgot.

03:09.917 --> 03:10.792
Lace bra.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.375
-Were they Ds--
-Be specific.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.208
Good news, Mr. Foster.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.959
The radiologist said your
scan is completely clear,

03:18.041 --> 03:19.959
but we'd like to keep you here
for a few more tests.

03:20.041 --> 03:21.291
Whatever you say, doc.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.709
(J.D.) <i>A lot of weird things</i>
<i>can happen in a hospital.</i>

03:23.792 --> 03:26.667
<i>Like Doug not getting</i>
<i>a dead body out of his bed</i>

03:26.750 --> 03:28.125
<i>before rigor mortis sets in.</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:29.792
Ted, give me a hand.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.291
He's not gonna fit in
the body bag like this,

03:31.375 --> 03:32.917
so lie across his feet,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.083
and I'm gonna push down his
head and straighten him out.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.500
Fun.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.667
And 1, 2, 3.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.792
-(crack)
-Aah!

03:44.250 --> 03:46.959
Ted?

03:47.041 --> 03:48.000
(J.D.) <i>Still the weirdest thing is</i>

03:48.083 --> 03:51.166
<i>when a really cool guy who's fine</i>
<i>and talking to you one minute...</i>

03:52.709 --> 03:54.834
<i>is dead the next.</i>

03:54.917 --> 03:56.834
<i>Of course, in hospitals,</i>
<i>this happens a lot,</i>

03:56.917 --> 03:58.625
<i>so you have to shake it off</i>
<i>and move on.</i>

03:58.709 --> 04:00.250
<i>Except when this happens.</i>

04:00.333 --> 04:05.125
Well, if it isn't the 4 horsewomen
of the apocalypse.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.667
There's a morbidity and mortality
conference tomorrow morning

04:07.750 --> 04:10.125
to figure out who's responsible
for Mr. Foster's death,

04:10.208 --> 04:13.333
and here's the exciting news.

04:13.417 --> 04:16.166
I'm pretty sure it was one of you.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.750
(duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh)

04:19.834 --> 04:22.083
You really gotta change
that cell phone ring.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.709
Ma, not now.

04:24.792 --> 04:28.166
<i>♪ I can't do this</i>
<i>All on my own ♪</i>

04:28.250 --> 04:29.834
<i>♪ No, I know ♪</i>

04:29.917 --> 04:33.709
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:35.000 --> 04:36.625
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:41.959 --> 04:45.417
(J.D.) <i>So a patient was dead</i>

04:45.500 --> 04:48.125
(duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh)

04:48.208 --> 04:49.834
Dude, you've gotta change
that cell phone ring.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.208
You think so, huh?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.959
Mom, not now.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.333
(J.D.)<i> With morbidity and</i>
<i>mortality conferences,</i>

04:56.417 --> 04:58.709
<i>the first question sets</i>
<i>the tone for the whole day.</i>

04:58.792 --> 05:00.000
Who the hell ate my scone?

05:00.083 --> 05:02.709
That would be me, Bobbo,
and it was delicious.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.083
My compliments to the little lady.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.875
-I made those.
-I know.

05:05.959 --> 05:09.333
Dorian, you admitted Mr. Foster with
coughing and shortness of breath,

05:09.417 --> 05:11.208
is that correct?

05:11.291 --> 05:13.125
(not amplified) Yes.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.959
Mike check. Mike check.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.834
(feedback)

05:22.542 --> 05:24.125
Yes.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.458
And then what happened?

05:26.709 --> 05:27.834
Dorian.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.375
I'm 10 feet away from you. Talk.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.750
Mr. Foster had
recently flown to India,

05:34.834 --> 05:37.959
where he had been exposed
to an outbreak of pertussis.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.458
I was gonna check on his labs,

05:39.542 --> 05:42.667
but first I had to visit another
patient, Mr. Sutton.

05:43.417 --> 05:46.959
So, Mr. Sutton, when you
came in with heartburn,

05:47.041 --> 05:49.291
I bet you thought I'd kick
your butt right out of here,

05:49.375 --> 05:51.417
but not this guy.
I admitted you,

05:51.500 --> 05:55.917
and I stayed up all night studying
your EKG because I had a hunch.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.333
And no girlfriend. But mostly
it was the hunch thing,

05:58.417 --> 06:02.125
and that hunch paid off because if
I hadn't found that blocked artery,

06:02.208 --> 06:03.792
you'd be dead right now.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.250
(J.D.) <i>And here comes the gratitude,</i>

06:05.333 --> 06:08.834
<i>the 2 words every doctor lives</i>
<i>to hear.</i>

06:08.917 --> 06:10.542
Later, dude.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.166
I can't believe
he didn't thank me.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.458
(scoffs) You'll thank me
when you leave, won't you?

06:17.542 --> 06:20.583
I don't know.
Why are you so needy?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.000
He keeps a hug schedule
with his friends.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.125
Oh, ok, Turk.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.917
Looks like someone's getting crossed
off their 2 o'clock spot

06:27.000 --> 06:28.625
and getting penciled in for never.

06:28.709 --> 06:30.083
How does that feel?
Does it sting?

06:30.166 --> 06:33.083
(J.D.)<i> He's hurting.</i>
<i>Hug him. Hug him now.</i>

06:33.166 --> 06:36.709
(Carla) You guys, what would you
do with $100 million?

06:36.792 --> 06:39.417
A $100 million?

06:39.500 --> 06:42.792
Sir, the super lotto jackpot
was up to $100 million,

06:42.875 --> 06:44.875
so earlier that morning...

06:44.959 --> 06:49.875
I'm just saying think of what you
could do with that kind of money.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.041
-I could get a trained shark.
-Why?

06:53.709 --> 06:55.250
Thanks for inviting me over,
Janitor.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.417
Anytime, buddy. Anytime.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.667
Wait for him. Wait for him.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.375
Can opener!

07:04.542 --> 07:07.375
The lobster's in the pot.
Devour. Devour.

07:10.542 --> 07:14.500
Something feels pinchy.
Whulp! Aah!

07:16.375 --> 07:18.041
Save me a leg.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.709
Aah!

07:19.792 --> 07:20.625
I'm in.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.625
And you know, we could buy
a lot more tickets

07:22.709 --> 07:24.250
if you collect money
from everyone.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.458
I'll start going through
their lockers.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.125
No. I meant asking them.

07:27.208 --> 07:31.125
Seems kind of
roundabout, but ok.

07:31.208 --> 07:34.750
Hey, Dr. Cox, you wanna put in
for some lottery tickets?

07:34.834 --> 07:36.709
Oh, gosh, Carla, I would.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.709
I really would,
but you see, I already set fire

07:39.792 --> 07:41.875
to a big pile of money
just this morning.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.500
Hey, we have the same chance
of winning as anyone else.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.792
And the category is ding!

07:47.875 --> 07:49.750
Things that have a better
chance of happening

07:49.834 --> 07:51.250
than you winning the lottery.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.875
Tedski, throw 10 seconds on
the clock for me, would you, please.

07:54.959 --> 07:55.792
-(beep)
-(Ted) Go.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.750
Brain transplants. Britney Spears
having another hit record.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.667
The rolling stones going
on a farewell tour

08:00.750 --> 08:01.750
and actually meaning it.

08:01.834 --> 08:05.375
Me caring about, yehh, anything
that happens on Wisteria Lane.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.792
Jessica Simpson winning an Oscar.
Jessica Alba winning an Oscar.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.542
Jessica Simpson becoming
Jessica Alba Simpson.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.500
-(beep) Time.
-Oh!

08:13.125 --> 08:16.208
Anyway, that explains why
I went into the room and said...

08:16.834 --> 08:19.208
What would you do
with $100 million?

08:19.291 --> 08:22.250
-Me? Floating head doctor.
-Here we go.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.834
Yeah, I'd spend
the money researching

08:23.917 --> 08:26.417
how to successfully separate
my head from my body.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.792
That way, I could literally
be in 2 places at once.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.500
Looking good, Mr. Henderson.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.834
Looking real good,
nurse Myers.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.166
(flatline on monitor)

08:39.250 --> 08:41.291
Uh-oh.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.709
He's flatlining!

08:43.792 --> 08:45.125
Body, come!

08:45.208 --> 08:48.792
("William Tell Overture" playing)

08:51.875 --> 08:53.792
Damn it.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.083
Starting CPR.

08:59.792 --> 09:00.792
Ow!

09:01.959 --> 09:04.583
There'd probably be some kinks
to work out initially.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.792
Where is that whore?

09:12.875 --> 09:14.333
Who's a whore?

09:15.083 --> 09:16.500
That'd be me, sir.

09:16.583 --> 09:19.125
Oh, of course.
Would you care to elaborate?

09:20.250 --> 09:23.208
You see, yesterday I went
shoe shopping...

09:23.291 --> 09:25.000
(Turk) <i>Shoe shopping.</i>

09:25.083 --> 09:26.917
(Ted) <i>Shoe shopping.</i>

09:27.000 --> 09:29.542
(men, thinking) <i>Shoe shopping.</i>

09:29.625 --> 09:31.333
Oh, puh-lease.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.291
Jordan used to use that one
on me all the time.

09:33.375 --> 09:36.458
Immune. Watch this.
Satin panties.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.792
(men straightening)

09:38.875 --> 09:41.500
Fine. I was checking
on Mrs. Wilk, and...

09:42.500 --> 09:45.500
Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to explain
to you my behavior before.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.750
It's not liking I was just making
out with some random guy

09:47.834 --> 09:49.375
in the hospital.
I wouldn't do that.

09:49.458 --> 09:53.583
Well, I did that once.
There was this medevac pilot.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.875
Actually he just turned out
to be an orderly

09:55.959 --> 09:59.625
who got his hands on a helicopter
helmet, but this is different.

09:59.709 --> 10:03.625
Sure, it could get complicated.
He has a son.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.458
And a wife.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.291
I've been making out
with a married man

10:10.375 --> 10:13.917
while his sick child
slept a few feet away!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.458
Oh, my God.
I've become my mother.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.250
-You said your wife was dead.
-No. I said she wasn't with us.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.083
Don't make me out
to be a bad guy.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.792
Well, you're not a good guy.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.500
Good guys don't lie
about being single

10:31.583 --> 10:33.166
or about being helicopter pilots.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.500
If you were a good guy,
you would get in there

10:34.583 --> 10:35.500
and tell her what happened.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.041
-You're right.
-Hell, yeah, I am.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.417
Wait, what?

10:44.917 --> 10:46.834
(Elliot) <i>You know how when</i>
<i>something horrible happens,</i>

10:46.917 --> 10:50.166
<i>like a car accident,</i>
<i>everything slows down?</i>

10:51.083 --> 10:53.333
(slow motion gasp)

10:53.417 --> 10:57.750
No!

10:59.917 --> 11:03.500
(normal speed)
Whore!

11:09.417 --> 11:10.917
Where is that whore?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.583
Hey, guys.
What's up?

11:15.667 --> 11:18.041
Elliot, would you do me a favor
and cover Mr. Foster for me?

11:18.125 --> 11:21.083
I have go to Mr. Sutton's house
and get the thank-you I deserve.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.333
You are so obsessing about this.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.709
It's like the time
you were convinced

11:24.792 --> 11:27.667
that the cafeteria workers were
giving you small waffles.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.000
How'd that work out for you?

11:29.083 --> 11:31.542
They waffle-ironed my foot.
But this is different, buddy.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.750
-Look, I need a ride.
-Pass.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.208
Oh, pass, huh?

11:35.291 --> 11:37.834
Well, this is what happened
last time you passed.

11:39.709 --> 11:41.583
Ew.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.250
Ok, put the foot away.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.917
Put the waffle foot away.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.041
This is where Sutton lives,
all right.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.417
Let's get in there.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.834
J.D.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.125
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

12:01.291 --> 12:02.834
Dude.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.583
(growls)

12:10.750 --> 12:12.959
Ok. Back away slowly.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.667
Oh, no. Turk,
they're organized.

12:18.750 --> 12:19.667
(warbles)

12:19.750 --> 12:21.834
-Run!
-(hissing)

12:21.917 --> 12:22.917
(gurgle)

12:23.000 --> 12:26.125
Good Lord, bobbo.
Was that your stomach?

12:26.208 --> 12:30.000
(J.D.) <i>And there it was. Hope.</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:33.417
<i>Dr. Kelso's inability to deal</i>
<i>with hunger was legendary.</i>

12:33.500 --> 12:35.542
<i>We were as good as home.</i>

12:35.625 --> 12:37.208
I've heard enough.

12:37.291 --> 12:40.875
-Let's call it and go to lunch.
-Just hold on!

12:40.959 --> 12:43.458
That is not the way it works,
bobbo.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.667
This is important, damn it.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.333
You sit back down
and get on with it.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.959
Perry, I'm in charge here.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.583
Ted, give him your sandwich.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.875
I suppose I could spare
a small corner.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.542
All right, everyone.
Just stay right where you are,

12:57.625 --> 12:59.583
and we will be back in...

13:00.667 --> 13:02.625
2 minutes.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.291
(J.D.) <i>One sandwich later,</i>
<i>we got back into it.</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:15.125
(mouth full)
And then what happened, Dr. Dorian?

13:15.208 --> 13:20.333
Well, sir, fortunately for us,
ostriches are flightless birds.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.208
(warbles)

13:22.291 --> 13:24.166
There goes the sentry.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.375
Every 3 minutes like clockwork.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.417
Dude, can I admit
something to you?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.750
I kind of missed
not getting my hug today.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.583
Here comes your vanilla bear.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.792
-J.D. J.D. Oh, J.D.--
-Whoa!

13:36.875 --> 13:39.333
Oh.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.375
Dude, don't sweat it.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.583
It says here that the ostrich
is generally a docile creature.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.792
Thank God.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.333
It also says their kick
can kill a man.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.125
What?! I'm coming back up.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.500
(hisses)

13:53.583 --> 13:55.208
Turk.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.000
(laughter on TV)

13:57.083 --> 14:00.667
-(whack)
-Oh!

14:02.583 --> 14:05.667
Mr. Sutton,
I hope this isn't a bad time.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.583
Who cares about Mr. Sutton?

14:08.667 --> 14:12.792
So, Dr. Reid,
you were covering Mr. Foster.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.750
Actually, sir, I was on my way
to cover Mr. Foster,

14:15.834 --> 14:18.041
but then I stopped in Mrs. Wilk's
room, and...

14:23.625 --> 14:25.959
-What are you doing?
-(whispering) Don't look at me.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.583
Keith, you see the woman
standing outside?

14:30.583 --> 14:31.500
Yeah, I see her.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.250
I made out with husband
this morning.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.125
That's disgusting.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.959
Ok, can you just get out of here
and go do P.F.D's on Mr. Foster?

14:41.166 --> 14:44.834
Dr. Reid, why are you hiding?
You didn't do anything wrong.

14:45.875 --> 14:46.834
If we all win this lottery,

14:46.917 --> 14:49.500
then I am using that money
to find a decent man.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.667
-(beeping)
-You may kiss the bride.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.166
Ahem.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.000
Ahem. Heh. Whoa.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.583
-Save it for tonight, big guy.
-(clang clang)

15:03.667 --> 15:04.834
(shatters)

15:04.917 --> 15:06.875
(robotic) <i>Mazel tov.</i>

15:08.166 --> 15:10.750
Why did I make him Jewish?
My parents will kill me.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.041
Why ostriches?

15:15.125 --> 15:17.458
They're such majestic creatures,
don't you think?

15:17.542 --> 15:20.250
And you know,
they're kind of like my children.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.333
Plus, I make belts
out of their necks.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.875
Ok, look, Mr. Sutton, I'm sure
you're wondering why I'm here.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.834
-(whack)
-Aah!

15:27.917 --> 15:29.250
There is a door.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.542
You ok?
Did you try and escape?

15:31.625 --> 15:34.583
I did escape.
There was one waiting in the car.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.917
That's Leon,
loves the car rides.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.333
Likes to stick his
head out the window,

15:38.417 --> 15:39.792
and I tell him
it's a little too dangerous,

15:39.875 --> 15:40.875
but he doesn't listen to me.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.875
Mr. Sutton, I cured you,
and you never thanked me.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.750
Why would I thank you
for doing your job?

15:45.834 --> 15:46.917
I'm a garbageman.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.083
How many times a day
do you think I get thanked?

15:49.166 --> 15:52.125
-6.
-You're off by about 6.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.375
12.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.709
Starting to see
why Leon outfoxed you.

15:55.792 --> 15:57.917
Stupid bird stole my hat.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.792
I just don't see
why it's such a big deal

15:59.875 --> 16:02.041
for you to say, "hey, doc..."

16:02.125 --> 16:02.959
(door closes)

16:03.041 --> 16:04.375
Why did he just
walk away like that?

16:04.458 --> 16:06.667
-I don't...
-(hisses)

16:07.709 --> 16:09.917
-Ruh-roh.
-Don't move.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.375
Have to admit he looks pretty phat
in your Kango.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.083
(warbles)

16:15.166 --> 16:18.000
Hey, everybody, they're about
to pick the lottery numbers.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.709
And remember that when
we win, we win as a family.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.083
I set aside 20 tickets
for just you and I to split.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.333
Perfect.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.500
Nurse Espinoza, Mr. Foster's
cough is getting worse,

16:27.583 --> 16:29.250
and Dr. Dorian's gone. Dr. Reid's
covering,

16:29.333 --> 16:30.709
but she's sort of indisposed.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.625
Kid, I'm about to become
a millionaire.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.083
Call Dr. Turk.
He's the surgeon on call.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.083
You're missing out.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.709
I bet there's plenty of things
you could do with $100 million.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.625
Oh, come on, you gotta
make that shot!

16:44.709 --> 16:46.041
(pounding)

16:46.125 --> 16:50.000
Let me outta here!
I will kill you!

16:50.083 --> 16:52.291
I'm watching the game.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.792
Sweetie, you wanna get naughty?

16:58.875 --> 17:03.834
Ooh... I--
oh, look at that. Ooh.

17:03.917 --> 17:07.333
Ooh... yeah.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.333
Oh, look...

17:11.792 --> 17:14.208
Oh, come on, do it.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.834
Ah, I can wait another day.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.208
Button up and watch the game.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.583
I gotta call my glass guy.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.291
Mrs. Brown, I want you to
know how sorry I am

17:29.375 --> 17:30.458
for kissing your husband.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.500
But we are 2 women
who have both been wronged

17:32.583 --> 17:33.959
and both been lied to.

17:34.041 --> 17:35.875
And the healthiest thing for us
to do right now

17:35.959 --> 17:39.625
is just to walk away from each other
with our dignity intact.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.166
Don't you agree?

17:42.750 --> 17:44.542
Do you know
what I do with whores?

17:45.875 --> 17:47.917
I punch them in the face.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.792
Bring it, bitch.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.875
Dude, are you really gonna
sit here all day

17:58.959 --> 18:00.166
just to thank your garbageman?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.959
Yes. Jabari has been added
to the hug schedule.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.041
-You wanna wait with me?
-I can't.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.041
I was supposed
to be on call 5 minutes ago.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.166
(J.D.) <i>This whole experience</i>
<i>got me thinking about</i>

18:09.250 --> 18:11.083
<i>the nature of gratitude.</i>

18:11.166 --> 18:12.333
<i>I guess in the end...</i>

18:12.417 --> 18:14.542
Whether you're a doctor
or a garbageman--

18:14.625 --> 18:17.583
Dorian!
What are you doing?

18:17.667 --> 18:21.375
Sorry, sir. Sometimes
I like to just sum things up.

18:21.458 --> 18:24.583
Well, allow me to do that for you.

18:24.667 --> 18:28.041
In the end, when Mr. Foster
started coughing up blood...

18:29.083 --> 18:30.458
(horn honking)

18:30.542 --> 18:33.166
(Dr. Kelso) <i>the on-call surgeon</i>
<i>was stuck in traffic...</i>

18:35.333 --> 18:38.583
<i>the nursing staff was busy</i>
<i>losing the lottery...</i>

18:41.583 --> 18:45.166
<i>his original doctor was</i>
<i>thanking a garbageman...</i>

18:47.166 --> 18:50.375
<i>and the covering physician</i>
<i>was incapacitated.</i>

18:51.917 --> 18:53.959
<i>And what was Mr. Foster doing?</i>

18:55.250 --> 18:58.333
<i>He was dying in the hands</i>
<i>of the interns.</i>

18:59.417 --> 19:01.417
How did I do, Dr. Dorian?

19:02.959 --> 19:04.000
Sorry I'm late.

19:04.083 --> 19:07.250
I got the keys to my Miata
stuck in the cadaver.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.667
Cut to the chase there,
pee pants.

19:09.750 --> 19:13.166
Mr. Foster's death was the result
of a Pulmonary Embolism,

19:13.250 --> 19:16.500
probably caused by the
21-hour flight he was on from India.

19:16.583 --> 19:20.125
But Dr. Flannery, the radiologist,
should have caught it on the scan.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.542
Working from an inaccurate report,

19:24.625 --> 19:26.834
there was nothing
any of you could have done

19:26.917 --> 19:29.417
to prevent Mr. Foster from passing.

19:30.417 --> 19:33.542
Which, I guess, leads us to you...

19:34.208 --> 19:35.542
Dr. Flannery.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.166
(J.D.) <i>After a day like today,</i>

19:41.250 --> 19:43.834
<i>there's really only</i>
<i>one thing you can do.</i>

19:43.917 --> 19:46.959
Too bad radiologists.

19:47.041 --> 19:48.750
Wait, wait,
let me get in on this.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.291
Let's also have a toast
to Mr. Foster's widow

19:51.375 --> 19:52.875
and his fatherless kids.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.208
Dr. Cox, it wasn't our fault.

19:55.291 --> 19:58.542
No. Because you were lucky.

19:58.625 --> 19:59.750
You know as well as I do

19:59.834 --> 20:02.166
it could have been
any one of your faults.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.458
Congrats again.

20:05.542 --> 20:06.875
Have a...

20:07.625 --> 20:09.417
have a swell party.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.667
(J.D.) <i>It's never easy when someone</i>
<i>accuses you of screwing up</i>

20:12.750 --> 20:15.709
<i>especially when you know it's true.</i>

20:15.792 --> 20:18.125
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>you can't shrug it off.</i>

20:18.208 --> 20:20.750
<i>Because in a hospital, the best</i>
<i>way to learn from your mistakes</i>

20:20.834 --> 20:22.500
