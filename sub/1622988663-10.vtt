towards you

to fornicate,

I'll just stop dancing

19:11.940 --> 19:13.942
Very well.

19:14.743 --> 19:17.247
My pruny ass
is getting a tan.

19:17.347 --> 19:19.350
[laughs]

19:26.760 --> 19:29.223
Well, where
should we start?

19:29.323 --> 19:30.385
Suppose we can start
by getting rid

19:30.485 --> 19:31.827
of some of
these dead bodies.

19:31.927 --> 19:33.709
Yeah, they're probably gonna
start stinking pretty soon.

19:33.809 --> 19:35.632
Hmm.

19:35.732 --> 19:37.734
Let's get to work.

19:39.537 --> 19:41.199
How about him?
He seems light.

19:41.299 --> 19:43.482
Mm-hmm.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.365
Three, two, one.

19:45.465 --> 19:52.635
