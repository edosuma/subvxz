[upbeat music]

00:06.089 --> 00:09.175
Look at us, standing around like
a bunch of farm animals.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.927
Why don't we ever sit down
to eat breakfast?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.512
'Cause it makes your ass big.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.890
Yeah, when you sit,
the food goes down

00:15.974 --> 00:18.101
it gets stuck
in your cheeks.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.770
Okay, I'm done.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.771
"Dear Vince.."

00:21.855 --> 00:24.441
- Oh, sick..
- Okay.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.736
"Dear Vince, I just want
to let you know that I feel

00:27.819 --> 00:29.195
"we're in a very good place now.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.781
"I know that we had very strong
feelings for each other

"but I have been
able to put that aside.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.785
"I am virtually over it.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.289
"And now, we can get on with
the business of being friends.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.750
Respectfully,
Holly Anne Tyler."

00:43.543 --> 00:44.627
I love it.
What do you guys think?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.212
- It'll never work.
- Sick.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.631
You all disgust me.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.133
This letter is from my heart.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.177
I am speaking
from my soul's core.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.221
Yeah, that's exactly
where the food gets stuck.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.474
Holly, people only write people
letters to tell them

00:57.557 --> 00:59.350
they're over them
when they're not over them.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.977
You know what this is,
don't you?

01:01.060 --> 01:04.147
It's a desperate attempt
to make contact with Vince

01:04.230 --> 01:06.357
and he's gonna see
right through you.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.943
Well, I don't know
if he's as smart as you.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.030
Okay, listen to me.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.323
The best way to
get over somebody

01:13.406 --> 01:14.824
is to just get
over them, okay?

01:14.908 --> 01:18.077
Go out, have fun,
meet new boys, stay a virgin.

01:19.662 --> 01:25.126
I could not agree more with
75% of what she just said.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.003
- Okay, we've got to get going.
- Where are you going?

01:27.086 --> 01:29.798
Uh, we have a meeting
with New York City Recycling.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.509
Alright. You haven't
had a new client in, uh..

01:32.592 --> 01:35.261
Two months seventeen days.
And we don't have one yet.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.848
How can you be so negative when
Jupiter is in your 10th house?

Everyone knows that's
good for business.

- Manager!

Don't worry about these.
I'll get 'em.

- I work here.

would love this on you.

Do you want one?

Are you selling them?

Uh! Gary, where are those
tops I wanted?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.146
Ow!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.066
- I'm Greg.
- Hi, I'm Holly.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.444
Damn, I wish you were
here a month ago.

'Cause then I would have
met you sooner.

Okay. There's an
explanation for that.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.953
My brother told me
that line was gold

03:24.037 --> 03:27.832
and I don't know why I would
listen to him, because he's 12.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.419
What's she doing?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.799
Thanks.
I didn't like anything.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.309
So you find something?

03:46.392 --> 03:49.187
Yep, another way
to piss Gary off.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.481
Hey, what was that all about?
Why are you talking to Greg?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.775
- He asked me out.
- Oh, you got a date?

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
That is fantastic.
Which one's Greg?

03:56.569 --> 03:57.779
- Oh, he's cute.
- Mm-hmm.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.322
No, no, no. You can't
go on a date with him.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.907
- Why not?
- He's the manager.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.243
Oh, you're right. People will
think I'm a gold-digger.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.120
Look, Holly,
I love my job, okay?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.830
It's the best job
I've ever had.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.707
I make great money,
and I meet a lot of women.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.043
Do you understand?
Money. Women.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.503
What's your point?

04:13.586 --> 04:14.629
Well, let's just say
you go out with Greg

04:14.712 --> 04:15.964
and he has a bad time.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.507
Now, who you think he's
gonna take that out on?

moving on, and on, and on--

Don't you think you're being
a little selfish here?

to date again, and I think--

Listen, if you're really
and truly worried about it

- Yeah.

- No, but way to bring me down.

There. See?
What did I tell you?

05:08.307 --> 05:10.268
I know. I did exactly
what you said.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.937
I went out, I had fun,
I met a new guy

05:13.021 --> 05:14.981
and I didn't stay a virgin.

No, I said stay a virgin.

- And you didn't tell me?

Okay, now, guys, just don't
jump to conclusions, okay?

It's not what you think.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.107
I'm not going
on a job interview.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.611
No. See, there's this
job interview, and, um..

06:01.694 --> 06:03.529
...I'm going on it.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.157
- Why?
- Why?

06:06.240 --> 06:10.036
Because that's how they'll know
if they want to hire me or not.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.746
So you were just
gonna desert me.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.872
No. Unh-unh! No.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.540
If by some chance
I did get this job

06:14.624 --> 06:16.375
then I was gonna talk
to them about you too.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.711
- Oh, were you?
- Yeah, I was.

but I don't need your charity.

work with a secretive

acting a little..

- That's rude.

- Well, I'm bored.
- You don't think I'm bored?

Will you be needing
any ketchup?

Alright, until Holly gets here
we may as well have a chat.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.388

conversation with each other.

07:52.471 --> 07:54.765
- This is a good test.
- You mean really talk?

going? How's it going?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.244
Is he happy? Having fun yet?
Is my job safe? Tina's weird.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.247
Look at the two
of you together

08:18.331 --> 08:20.374
looking like two
little turtledoves.

You know, Holly
is such a nice girl.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.420
She's always spoken
so highly of you.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.839
Aw. Yeah, well, we had
a really great time.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.591
Greg's really
into astronomy.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.843
He knows all of
the constellations.

08:30.927 --> 08:35.097
I had no idea how into it
he was when he asked me out.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.390
No idea.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
Astronomy, huh?
That's fascinating.

08:39.684 --> 08:43.397
I mean, you know, Holly has
spoken so highly of astronomy.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.108
Hey, tomorrow night, there's
gonna to be a lunar eclipse.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.443
Get out!

08:48.653 --> 08:50.488
You know, Holly said
she had a terrace

08:50.571 --> 08:52.406
so I was trying to talk her
into watching it at her place.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.783
You guys should come too.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.868
Well, you know, I would
love to, but unfortunately

08:55.952 --> 08:57.787
you have me scheduled
to work tomorrow night.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.457
Gary, don't worry about it. I
think I can pull a few strings.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.084
That's right.
Ha ha!

09:03.167 --> 09:05.419
You can pull some strings
'cause you're my boss.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.381
[chuckles]
And you control my destiny
just in case anyone here

09:08.464 --> 09:11.133
at this table
has forgotten that.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.094
Well, I'm gonna
have to ask my sister

09:13.177 --> 09:15.429
because she's kind of weird
about people on our terrace

09:15.513 --> 09:16.764
looking at eclipses.

09:18.015 --> 09:18.933
Oh, that's cool.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.518
Excuse me for a second?

09:24.313 --> 09:25.648
Oh, my God!

09:25.731 --> 09:27.441
I am so sorry,
you poor thing.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.901
It's worse than you think.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.861
Have you ever been
on a date with a star freak

09:30.945 --> 09:32.446
on a very clear night?

09:32.530 --> 09:36.200
Do you have any idea how many
constellations there are?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.828
Gary, I'm sorry. I don't want to
cause trouble for you at work

09:38.911 --> 09:40.913
but there's, like,
no connection.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.541
No, no, no. Can't you just hang
in there for two more months?

09:43.624 --> 09:46.919
I need Presidents' Day
weekend off for a ski trip.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.921
Okay, here's what
I'll do for you.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.549
I will stay with him until..

09:51.632 --> 09:54.135
...he comes back
from the bathroom.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.386
I mean, come on,
you're my friend.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.054
I am, and I would do
anything for you

09:57.138 --> 09:58.347
but this is not gonna happen.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.890
I mean, I really don't care

09:59.974 --> 10:03.686
if the sun is a "star"
and he so, so does.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.354
Well, I'm not letting
the two of you out of my sight.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.106
You can't breakup with him
in front of people.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.192
Gary, I would break up with him
in front of his entire family

10:10.276 --> 10:12.194
at his beloved nana's funeral.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.739
I don't like him.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.992
Oh, hey, before
you sit down

10:18.075 --> 10:19.785
you and I need to
take a little walk.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.953
- Hey.
- Vince, oh.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.039
- How you doing?
- Hey.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.959
I'm on an awesome date!

10:41.891 --> 10:44.810
It was crazy! It was like,
I was looking at sweaters

10:44.894 --> 10:47.438
and then I knocked some over,
and then Greg picked 'em up!

10:48.272 --> 10:50.316
It was like a movie.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.609
That's great.
Good for you.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.570
Yeah. Fate was
kind to us.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.072
That is such a cute story.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.907
Should we tell them what
happened the first night we met?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.992
No! No, no, no.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.453
Alright, guys,
we're gonna get going.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.455
It was good to meet you, Greg.
This was cool.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.165
We should hang out sometime.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.833
Uh, I'm having a party
at my house tomorrow night

11:07.917 --> 11:09.752
to celebrate the lunar eclipse.
You guys should come.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.379
- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.048
An eclipse, total,
no moon, pure dark.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.841
You guys should come.
It's gonna rock.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.136
Ooh! You and me,
outdoors, dark..

11:19.220 --> 11:20.262
I like the sound
of that.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.931
Oh, well, we have
lots of lights, too.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.850
Very bright lights,
you can see us from space.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.520
It's true.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.938
They have satellites
that can read

11:29.021 --> 11:31.065
your license plate
from space.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.700
Isn't he smart?

11:44.703 --> 11:47.456
Yeah. It sounds cool.
We'll be there.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.624
It was nice
to meet you guys.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.959
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.588
I can't wait for you
to see the lunar penumbra.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.550
What?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.018
Hi!

12:08.102 --> 12:09.645
Oh, thank God
you're finally home!

12:09.728 --> 12:11.147
The recycle people
left you a message.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.440
They wanna hire you.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
- What?
- Come listen. Come listen!

12:17.945 --> 12:19.905
Val, do you know
what this means?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.074
I can't believe it!

12:22.158 --> 12:23.868
Why? Lauren said
you were great.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.661
They loved you.
You were on fire.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.998
No, I just got back from my
interview at Stellar and McQueen

12:29.081 --> 12:31.292
and they offered me the job,
right on the spot.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.127
Oh. Well, now you don't
have to take it.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.421
I mean, you said this account
would be the best thing ever.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.173
Yeah, but so is this job.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.675
Yeah, but you'd still be
working for somebody else.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.927
Holly..

12:42.011 --> 12:45.306
...they had so much
Sweet'n Low.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.058
And-and boxes and boxes
of Zone bars.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.103
Yeah, if there was something
you want and you don't see it..

12:51.187 --> 12:53.898
...then they have it
"in the back."

12:53.981 --> 12:56.609
So you're going to quit
your own business

12:56.692 --> 12:58.903
for Zone bars
and a sugar substitute?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.406
I don't know.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.283
I-I mean, when I went
to that office today

13:04.366 --> 13:08.078
there were elevators and people
and life and noise and..

13:08.162 --> 13:09.872
What do you think
I should do?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.123
I don't know.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.043
It's just when I got up
this morning

13:14.126 --> 13:15.878
and I got dressed
and I went to that office

13:15.961 --> 13:19.548
the atmosphere just seemed
to fit, you know?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.009
It.. I just felt...safe.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.055
You haven't been
feeling safe?

13:26.138 --> 13:29.642
Actually, no. I've, I've been
feeling kind of scared.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.894
About what?

13:31.977 --> 13:36.065
I worry, you know? I worry about
you, I worry about Lauren and..

13:36.148 --> 13:38.484
Well, stop. Stop worrying
about everybody else

13:38.567 --> 13:40.027
and make this
decision for you.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.447
- Really?
- Really.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.617
Oh, thank you.
You are the best.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.118
What the hell is that?

13:48.202 --> 13:49.411
My date's telescope.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.080
I'm throwing an
eclipse party tonight.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.624
You-you're throwing a party?

13:53.707 --> 13:54.833
Don't you think
you should've told me?

13:54.917 --> 13:55.960
Probably should've.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.843
I don't see what's so exciting
about an eclipse.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.262
I mean, if you don't want
to see the moon..

14:06.345 --> 14:07.388
...don't look at it.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.685
I've been ignoring
Vince all night.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.229
Look at him.
It's driving him crazy.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.064
Yeah, it's killin' him.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.149
Alright, get ready because
I'm about to kick it up a notch.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.527
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

14:23.487 --> 14:24.488
Hey!

14:25.739 --> 14:27.950
Wanna look through
the telescope?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.202
The penumbra
is impressive.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.372
That's alright..

14:33.455 --> 14:35.374
...'cause I'd rather
look at you.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.130
Hey, I bet we could get
a better look from up here.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.549
- No. Actually, this--
- Move it!

14:47.636 --> 14:48.679
That's better.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.308
Now, tell me about
that penumbra thing again.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.478
- Well, a penumbra..
- Mm-hmm.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.856
That's this area
of partial illumination.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.941
Ooh, illumination!

15:08.073 --> 15:10.242
Pernumber.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.453
I'm really, really
glad I met you.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.996
Yeah, I'm glad
I met you too.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.332
I can't even believe
this is happening.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.917
This is one of the most
awesome nights of my life.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.758
- I can't do this.
- What?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.676
Come here.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.972
I'm so sorry.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.474
I'm a horrible,
horrible person

15:33.557 --> 15:34.558
and you're so sweet.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.852
But I like that guy out there

15:36.935 --> 15:38.187
and I was just--

15:38.270 --> 15:39.855
- I know.
- You know what?

15:39.938 --> 15:41.523
You're in love
with that guy.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.692
I knew as soon as I saw you
looking at him at the diner.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.861
- But I was just--
- Using me.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.947
I know. It's okay.
I was using you too.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.241
When I found out you had
this awesome terrace..

15:51.325 --> 15:53.202
...all I could think about
was how perfect

15:53.285 --> 15:55.537
the lunar view would be.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.082
And plus, you were like
kissing me and stuff.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.833
It was a win-win.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.335
You know, I'm really
glad to hear that

16:01.418 --> 16:02.878
because I was
feeling awful.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.381
- No problem.
- Hmm.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.549
Seriously, if I wasn't madly
in love with that guy

16:07.633 --> 16:09.802
I would totally
hang out with you.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.553
Yeah.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.555
Listen, I've been waiting
four and a half years

16:13.639 --> 16:15.182
for this eclipse so..

16:15.265 --> 16:16.642
...unless you want to
make out some more..

16:16.725 --> 16:17.935
No. Go ahead.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.238
So, what's going on with Greg?
Did you come on too strong?

16:29.321 --> 16:30.322
Am I fired?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.035
Well, you know,
it doesn't matter.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.122
Who cares about money
and women anyway, huh?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.584
Hey, look at the moon.
It's kind of cool.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.212
Yeah, it is.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.007
Maybe it would be better
if you looked at that.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.434
Hey.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.520
It's cool, huh?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.400
We're not gonna go blind
looking at that, are we?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.902
That's a sun eclipse,
dumb-ass.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.784
So, that was an interesting
little conversation we had

17:15.867 --> 17:17.618
at the diner last night.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.121
Was it?
I don't remember.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.623
It's all a blank.
You're weird.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.291
Dude, relax. I was just
yanking your chain

17:23.375 --> 17:24.501
about the whole
making out stuff.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.795
Give me a break.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.548
I knew that. You know what
I'm saying? I'm not trippin'.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.523
I am never, ever, ever having
an eclipse party again.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.525
I don't know. That Greg guy
was kind of cute.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.860
Yeah, well, I'm glad
you think that

17:49.943 --> 17:51.570
because with the lunar view
from our terrace

17:51.653 --> 17:52.863
he may never leave.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.825
Oh, good. I was just
coming to--

17:56.909 --> 17:59.703
Hello, Holly Anne.
I see you're with your guardian.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.207
I'm just gonna wait inside.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.085
Do you have a second?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.298
- Holly, I--
- How are you?

18:11.381 --> 18:14.051
- Aw. Hey.
- Okay.

18:14.134 --> 18:17.179
- Okay, come here.
- Aw! It's so good to see you.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.806
- So good.
- You too.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.475
- Um, here, sit down.
- Okay.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.352
Man, feels like I haven't
seen you in forever.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.853
How've you been?
You look great.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.231
Thanks.
Yeah, so do you.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.359
Wait, what's the matter?

18:30.442 --> 18:31.902
Nothing. I'm fine.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.114
- Holly, come on.
- No, seriously, I'm fine.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.281
Okay.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.703
So, what's going on with you?
Um, how are things with Vince?

18:41.787 --> 18:45.290
Oh, God, he's, um, hey,
can we talk about this yet?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.084
I mean,
are we friendly enough?

18:47.167 --> 18:49.086
I don't know.
Let's see.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.382
- How's Vince?
- Stupid.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.883
Yeah, we can do this.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.887
I don't know if anything's gonna
happen with me and Vince.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.556
Why? What happened?

19:00.639 --> 19:02.391
Well, he's got a lot
of girlfriends

19:02.474 --> 19:06.937
and even if we did
eventually, you know..

19:07.020 --> 19:09.523
I don't know if he knows
how to have a relationship.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.569
Well, maybe if the right person
comes along, he'll, uh..

19:13.652 --> 19:15.779
- Hey!
- Oh, Kate.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.240
Yeah, she had
a late class.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.575
- Hi, Holly.
- Hey.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.034
Hi. Umm..

19:22.786 --> 19:24.204
Oh, you may kiss.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.834
Hey, so did you guys see
the lunar eclipse tonight?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.545
Oh, yeah, the pernundrum
was very impressive.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.424
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.925
I'd have ordered you something
but I didn't know--

19:37.009 --> 19:37.968
Oh..

19:38.051 --> 19:41.013
Kate, I, uh...stole these

19:41.096 --> 19:42.848
from across the street.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.767
I know how you hate
that refined white sugar.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.103
That is so sweet.

19:48.186 --> 19:51.440
Well, you know,
I do my best.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.111
Okay, I wasn't really
that mad

19:56.194 --> 19:57.821
that you were looking
for another job.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.657
I was mostly mad because you
were feeling all this pressure

20:00.741 --> 20:01.825
and you didn't tell me.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.868
You know, maybe I could have

20:02.951 --> 20:04.036
done something to help.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.203
I guess I didn't think

20:05.287 --> 20:06.580
I was even gonna get that job

20:06.663 --> 20:07.706
so I figured, what was the point

20:07.789 --> 20:09.041
of upsetting everybody?

20:09.124 --> 20:11.960
Well, whatever you decide,
just know that I will be

20:12.044 --> 20:14.129
totally okay with it.

20:14.212 --> 20:17.507
- I'm not taking that job.
- Oh, thank God.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.052
I was ready to kill myself.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.553
So, we're open for
business tomorrow

20:21.637 --> 20:23.263
if you want to come back.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.057
Of course I want to come back

20:25.140 --> 20:27.851
but do you swear that this
is what you wanna do?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.269
Positive.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.480
When I was talking to
the head of the company

20:31.563 --> 20:34.107
I was telling her how I was
trying to start my own business

20:34.191 --> 20:36.818
and get this,
she was jealous of me.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.528
Why, was she butt-ugly?

20:40.030 --> 20:42.908
No. She told me the most
exciting time in her life

20:42.991 --> 20:45.160
was when she was trying to get
her business off the ground.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.329
She said she almost
quit a million times.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.706
But when she finally made it,
it was so worth it.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.500
I want what she has

20:51.583 --> 20:54.211
minus the three divorces
and the lesbian rebound.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.839
Hey. So, what's up?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.008
Lauren, you coming back
to work for Val?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.678
Actually, I'm thinking
about keeping both jobs.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.846
You know me. I got to
keep my plate full.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.557
I am a big time overachiever!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.059
Lauren, Jesse's husband called.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.103
She just went into labor.
Can you cover her shift?

21:11.186 --> 21:12.229
No can do.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.654
