WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.204
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.221
Carmen, I need information.
What do you want from me?

00:20.254 --> 00:23.691
The price is you-- so
from now on, I call, you come,

00:23.724 --> 00:26.094
and you do exactly
what I ask you to do.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.231
Your friend, Dreamer,
stuck a memory in my head

00:30.264 --> 00:31.265
without asking my permission.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.433
It's a memory of you.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.667
She did it to save the team.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.902
You're not making this
any better.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.204
I've got my own issues
to sort out,

00:36.237 --> 00:37.671
my own people to find.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.208
Clarice!

00:40.241 --> 00:42.042
-I'm Wes.
-It's nice to meet you.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.279
WES:
Welcome to Florence.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.081
It's beautiful.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.582
There are rumors of mutants

00:48.616 --> 00:50.451
hunting other mutants
for Sentinel Services.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.186
Reed Strucker, who worked
with a judge there, said the guy

00:52.220 --> 00:54.088
-might have info on the program.
-If we break in,

00:54.122 --> 00:56.023
we might be able to figure out
what the hell's going on.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.691
-You get the hard drives?
-I'm almost in.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.693
All right,
I have the hard drives.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.362
Carmen? What do you want?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.063
I'm collecting on our agreement.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.566
Time for you to pay me back.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.737
(country song playing)

01:18.679 --> 01:21.782
Marcos. Thanks for coming.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.052
You bring me out to the sticks
just to try the coffee, or what?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.620
POLARIS:
If that's why you came out,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.056
prepare to be disappointed--
coffee sucks here.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.258
(low whirring)

01:30.291 --> 01:31.325
THUNDERBIRD:
This is Lorna.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.960
She's my partner on this thing.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.362
Lorna, Marcos.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.800
-Hi. -THUNDERBIRD:
I'll get right to it.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.236
We've heard a lot about you,
what you can do.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.004
We want you to join
the Mutant Underground.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.109
Listen, I'm flattered,
but, uh...

01:49.143 --> 01:51.245
I don't think you guys get
my situation.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.014
Your situation's...
why we're here.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.283
We know your story.
You're already

01:55.316 --> 01:56.817
helping mutants
cross the border.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.619
We just want you
to do it full-time.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.288
That was just
a side thing, okay?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.522
There was room
in a couple of trucks,

02:01.555 --> 02:03.157
so I gave some people a ride,
that's all.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.326
You really want to run drugs
for the Guerra Cartel

02:05.359 --> 02:06.460
the rest of your life?
You could make a difference.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.028
It's more complicated than that.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.129
POLARIS:
What, because you're dating

02:09.163 --> 02:11.199
the boss's daughter?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.600
Get a new girlfriend.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.701
That simple, huh?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.436
-Just break it off?
-Sure.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.171
Tinder's full of girls
that are into mutants.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.872
Yeah, you don't know Carmen.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.275
She's, uh... she's tough.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.711
There are other tough chicks.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.014
THUNDERBIRD:
Think about it, Marcos.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.516
The X-Men are gone.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.850
The government's cracking down.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.519
If mutants are gonna survive,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.221
it's up to us.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.829
*

02:47.868 --> 02:50.204
ECLIPSE (over phone):
Look, Carmen, I can't do this.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.672
We made a deal.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.374
-Or did you forget?
-No.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.243
Of course I didn't forget.
But it's just...

02:55.276 --> 02:56.577
(crickets chirping)

02:56.610 --> 02:58.212
Now's not a good time.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.380
You think it was

02:59.413 --> 03:00.881
convenient for me to find out

03:00.914 --> 03:02.816
-where that prison convoy
was going? -No.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.386
-And I appreciate that, but...
-Then show your appreciation

03:05.419 --> 03:07.187
by honoring our deal.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.989
You knew what you
were getting yourself into

03:09.022 --> 03:11.492
when you asked me to help you
find your precious magnet girl.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.094
-Is that a threat? -This
doesn't need to be difficult.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.563
We can talk about this

03:15.596 --> 03:17.030
like reasonable people.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.467
I'll expect you tomorrow.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.570
(line hangs up)

03:24.905 --> 03:26.240
(sighs)

03:28.942 --> 03:30.878
*

03:54.768 --> 03:56.203
All right, listen up.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.539
Been talking
with the other stations.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.875
Sentinel Services is ramping up
surveillance across the board.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.311
So it looks like things
are gonna get worse

04:03.344 --> 04:05.045
-before they get better.
-Well, how much worse?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.814
With all these new refugees
coming in, we're running out

04:06.847 --> 04:08.215
of food, blankets,
everything.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.050
I heard Marietta
might have some supplies--

04:10.083 --> 04:12.553
-I can head up there this
afternoon. -All right.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.422
How's it coming with the
hard drives from Baton Rouge?

04:14.455 --> 04:15.823
We're working on cracking them.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.224
Well, the bad news is
they're encrypted.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.792
But the good news is
it probably means

04:18.826 --> 04:20.728
-that there's something
worth hiding. -Okay, if we

04:20.761 --> 04:22.330
don't figure out how they're
turning mutants against us,

04:22.363 --> 04:23.397
none of this is gonna matter.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.565
And one more thing.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.999
I'm gonna go track down Clarice.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.468
Now?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.269
You really think
that's a good idea?

04:29.303 --> 04:31.739
She knows where this place is.
If Sentinel Services catches her

04:31.772 --> 04:33.807
right now, it's gonna be
a disaster. All right?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.075
We got a lot of work to do.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.176
Let's get to it.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.346
Hey.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.080
These supplies--
I can go with you.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.649
No. No, you got training to do.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.816
I already talked to them.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.185
I got this.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.494
*

04:58.298 --> 05:00.267
Come on. It's cool.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.770
Promise.
I got to show you this.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.505
Why can't you just do it inside?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.507
-Someone might see.
-No one's gonna see us.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.841
We're not supposed
to be up here.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.142
We're practically touching
the building.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.778
-(scaffolding groans)
-(sighs): Stop.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.246
Come on, can't you
just bend the rules this once?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.951
Do you want to miss out
on everything?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.888
You are like
a textbook bad influence.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.123
-You know that, right?
-Okay.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.825
Yeah, it's no big deal.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.827
(sighs)

05:26.860 --> 05:28.161
Fine.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.163
Okay, I'll check it out.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.532
But it better be cool.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.233
It will be.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.503
(scaffolding creaking)

05:35.536 --> 05:38.171
-Hey, it's... We're good.
-(exhales)

05:40.207 --> 05:41.742
(scaffolding creaking)

05:41.775 --> 05:44.712
Great. It's the ground.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.014
Just hang on a sec.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.616
Close your eyes.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.284
Please?

05:53.587 --> 05:54.722
Okay.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.391
(laughs):
What...

05:59.460 --> 06:00.894
(whooshing)

06:00.928 --> 06:02.362
Now open them.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.597
(gasps)

06:03.631 --> 06:04.932
(exhales)

06:04.965 --> 06:06.667
LAUREN:
It's gorgeous.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.836
WES: Better than being
stuck indoors, right?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.504
(Lauren laughs softly)

06:10.538 --> 06:13.206
Have you ever been
to the mountains?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.508
Close enough.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.609
The Nature Channel.
(chuckles)

06:15.643 --> 06:17.711
LAUREN:
This is amazing.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.212
(laughs)

06:19.246 --> 06:21.314
I'm glad you like it.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.054
Do you want to go back inside?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.593
In a second.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.095
*

06:35.128 --> 06:36.363
ANDY:
Hey.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.432
You guys get checked
for herpes, right?

06:38.466 --> 06:41.401
-I hear it's super contagious.
-Way to be a stalker, Andy.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.771
Mom told me to come get you.
It's lunch.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.107
(Lauren sighs)

06:52.513 --> 06:54.448
(whining)

06:56.283 --> 06:58.919
-(continues whining)
-Oh. Fine.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.488
One bite.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.625
Mmm, good girl.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.127
-Hey, what took so long?
-I couldn't find her,

07:07.160 --> 07:08.996
so I decided to look
on the roof.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.432
The roof? Guys, you're
not supposed to go on the roof.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.302
Yeah. I checked
and she wasn't there.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.004
Where were you again?

07:17.037 --> 07:20.240
Um, downstairs. Supply room.
Just lost track of time.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.342
This mac and cheese is great.
You do something different?

07:22.375 --> 07:26.480
No, it's exactly the same
as the last 20 times.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.984
I haven't seen you guys
working on your homework.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.420
-I want those papers tomorrow.
-You were serious?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.454
Mom, the only cool thing about
being a refugee

07:34.488 --> 07:36.323
-is no school.
-Well, that's the deal.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.425
You want to train,
you're also gonna study.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.827
(sighs)

07:57.310 --> 08:01.114
Looks like the first drive is
all police files on mutants.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.283
The encryption is deeper
on this one.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.152
It's much deeper.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.887
It reads like
a shopping list.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.790
Whatever program the Sentinel
Services is working with,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.992
they seem to be
cherry-picking mutants

08:12.025 --> 08:13.827
based on the powers they want.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.329
They're not even pretending
this is legal.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.865
(scoffs)
I mean...

08:22.369 --> 08:24.572
Hold on.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.541
What is it?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.420
(indistinct chatter)

08:46.760 --> 08:49.062
-(child laughing)
-PAULA: Grace is gone.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.631
We lost our little girl.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.904
JACE:
Dr. Campbell.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.407
Agent Turner.
Thank you for making the time.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.909
I know you're a busy man.
Oh, I brought you one of these

09:01.942 --> 09:04.011
from that spot
across the street.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.446
Some kind of artisanal nonsense.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.048
Thank you.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.116
I was hoping to get a sense

09:09.149 --> 09:10.250
of how our surveillance program

09:10.283 --> 09:12.052
is proceeding.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.854
Well, we've been monitoring
every phone call in the region,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.889
but the Mutant Underground,
they're not exactly using

09:15.923 --> 09:17.591
each other's names
in these calls.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.092
They're ditching burner cells
every day, they're using

09:19.126 --> 09:21.294
some sort of cloaking
to beat our scans.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.930
Yes. Well, that reinforces
my conviction

09:22.963 --> 09:24.732
that we should take
a more direct approach.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.801
More direct?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.438
I'm-I'm not sure
what you mean.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.306
Surveillance alone
isn't working.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.710
To date, we've deployed
our mutant assets cautiously.

09:36.744 --> 09:40.147
But now it's time
to be more aggressive.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.283
You're talking about placing
mutant assets in the field?

09:43.316 --> 09:44.484
Yes.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.056
Yeah, um,
with all due respect,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.590
I'm just... I'm not sure
they're suitable

09:50.624 --> 09:51.925
for undercover work.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.227
Oh, you'd be surprised.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.665
We placed several assets
in local prisons

09:57.698 --> 09:59.566
as part of an
experimental program.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.902
They remained
completely undetected

10:01.935 --> 10:03.771
until they were activated.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.575
And when they were activated,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.343
they were quite effective.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.448
We can start immediately.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.365
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to come.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.002
I almost didn't-- I got out
of this for a reason.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.371
I remember. "To fight for
your fellow mutants."

10:38.405 --> 10:40.373
Nothing to do with the girl
with the green hair.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.675
-Can we leave her out of this?
-Of course.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.910
I'd like nothing better.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.780
Marcos, the truth is
our little reunion

10:46.814 --> 10:48.849
could be a good thing
for everyone,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.718
your mutant brothers
and sisters included.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.319
Yeah? How's that?

10:52.352 --> 10:55.522
Your people, my people,
they have a lot in common--

10:55.555 --> 10:57.224
the hiding, the fighting,
the Feds.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.826
I mean, how is it
so different?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.227
Maybe because we don't
sell drugs for a living?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.628
My point is
we can help each other.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.563
You have power,
I have money.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.066
And together?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.035
Think of the possibilities.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.903
I think there's
a good possibility

11:09.937 --> 11:11.404
we all end up dead
or in prison.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.673
So stubborn.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.942
I've missed you.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.411
Just hear me out.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.417
CAITLIN: So, we might not have
the best biology books,

11:24.451 --> 11:27.855
but we do have these pea plants,

11:27.888 --> 11:30.223
and they can teach us
a lot about genetics.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.060
In the 1800s, there was a monk

11:33.093 --> 11:37.731
who studied plants
just like these

11:37.765 --> 11:41.401
to learn how different traits
were passed down.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.103
Traits like the X-Gene.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.442
So if you guys want to come
check out the pea plants,

11:49.476 --> 11:54.214
you can see all the different
sizes and shapes and colors.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.716
Be right back.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.086
-What?
-We have a situation. You know

11:59.119 --> 12:01.955
-the boy that Lauren has been
spending time with, Wes? -Yeah.

12:01.989 --> 12:05.125
I'm familiar. I'm not a fan,
but Lauren seems to like him.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.794
I've been going through
the mutant criminal files,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.261
and I think he's in them.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.797
Sounds like
he's been conning people,

12:09.830 --> 12:12.132
-robbing stores in Cartersville.
-Okay,

12:12.165 --> 12:14.734
that... doesn't sound good,

12:14.768 --> 12:16.369
but we can't overreact.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.938
Lauren's been through
a lot lately.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.940
We-we just need
to take this slow.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.109
We're not talking about parking
tickets. I need to talk to him.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.044
You need to talk to her.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.745
She's not gonna be happy
about this.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.548
The worst thing you could do
would be to go on the attack.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.951
(sighs)
You're right.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.287
I will talk to her.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.293
*

12:42.329 --> 12:43.530
On your right!

12:44.865 --> 12:47.000
Skyler, duck!

12:47.034 --> 12:48.969
(grunts)

12:54.875 --> 12:56.609
Here to train?

12:56.643 --> 13:00.013
No, no, no. No.
Uh, I need to talk to Andy.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
Hey.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.620
-How's it going?
-Good.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.789
You know, at least if
we get attacked by some tiles,

13:09.823 --> 13:10.924
I'll be ready.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.860
-What's up?
-Where's your sister?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.294
I thought
she was supposed to be here.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.795
Yeah. Me, too. I don't know.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.630
-Not sure.
-Well, I need to talk to her.

13:17.664 --> 13:22.135
-Is she with Wes? -(stammers)
I really can't, uh...

13:22.169 --> 13:23.837
I-I don't know. She just said
they were going out

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
and that she'd kill me
if I said anything, okay?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.208
Believe me, Andy, you are the
least of her worries right now.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.312
(birds chirping)

13:36.549 --> 13:38.852
(groans)
Damn it.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.854
-Stupid soup.
-(door opens)

13:43.991 --> 13:47.360
Clarice, wait!
Wait! Just hang on.

13:48.996 --> 13:49.997
What are you doing here?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.300
Well, I'm not here for the soup.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.535
You're tough to track,
you know that?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.104
-You didn't leave much
of a trail. -Yeah?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.307
That was intentional.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.709
Hey. Listen,

14:02.742 --> 14:04.912
I'm sorry, all right?
What happened with you

14:04.945 --> 14:07.180
-and Sonya, I should have
told you. -Ya think?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.382
You know, I still see
that memory she put in my head.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.085
It's like a bad soap opera
I can't escape.

14:12.119 --> 14:15.022
I'm here to convince you
to come back.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.423
You're not safe out here
right now.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.991
You're concerned for my safety?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.061
-That's why you came?
-No, that's not all.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.532
The Underground needs you.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.534
"The Underground."

14:27.567 --> 14:30.003
(chuckles)
Got it.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.339
Sorry, but that's your battle,
not mine.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.573
I have stuff to do.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.544
"Stuff"? What stuff?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.747
Remember when I got sick? I kept
trying to portal to that road?

14:40.780 --> 14:43.883
-Yeah, somewhere out in the
countryside. -I'm trying to find

14:43.917 --> 14:47.354
that spot. You guys taught me
that none of this is random--

14:47.387 --> 14:49.756
the reasons why we use
our powers, what we do.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.025
That road must mean something
to me.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.394
And I want to know why.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.462
Let me help you find it.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.896
What?
(scoffs) No.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.032
-I don't need your help.
-Yeah, you do.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.367
I've been tracking you,
remember?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.035
You clearly have no idea
where you're headed.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.570
Let me do this for you.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.738
I owe you, if nothing else.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.844
Fine.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.450
When you're finished
with the CI paperwork,

15:17.484 --> 15:19.886
we're gonna need support teams
for these assets, so...

15:19.919 --> 15:22.589
-let's get the overtime
authorized. -Sir?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.757
-Yeah.
-Bit of a situation.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.094
-Lady from the DOJ is here.
-What does she want?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.729
Same thing as always.
Make our lives harder.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.298
DOJ OFFICIAL: We need to discuss
this new field operation

15:31.331 --> 15:32.632
you're planning.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.135
Yeah, we've been preparing
a brief.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.137
A brief? You should have
filed that before

15:37.170 --> 15:39.639
you launched this program.
This is a legal nightmare.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.741
-You don't have warrants,
probable cause. -Ma'am, you have

15:41.774 --> 15:43.843
no idea what these people
are capable of.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.113
Under the terrorist guidelines,
we're not obligated to let...

15:46.146 --> 15:48.515
We're not in Fallujah.
You're looking for suspects in

15:48.548 --> 15:50.250
the suburbs of Atlanta.
I hear you're working with

15:50.283 --> 15:52.452
-a Dr. Campbell?
-He's provided assets

15:52.485 --> 15:54.621
to the agency in the past.
We've just broadened the scope

15:54.654 --> 15:56.023
-of the partnership.
-He runs a program

15:56.056 --> 15:57.590
that officially doesn't exist.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.192
The legal ground
is just too shaky.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.861
You need to suspend
this program at once.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.330
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.599
We're talking about the safety
of our community. Now,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.535
if you're planning on coming
after what we're doing here,

16:08.568 --> 16:12.272
I promise you, I will fight you
with everything that I have.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.741
Well, then I guess
you're in for a fight.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.514
Good work today.
Keep practicing.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.317
And, Andy, try not to do any
structural damage, all right?

16:24.351 --> 16:26.086
No promises.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.521
Hey.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.989
Have you seen Marcos?

16:30.023 --> 16:31.791
No. I think he's still out.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.327
(sighs) He just went to Marietta
to get some supplies.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.329
He, uh, should be back.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.330
Should be, but isn't.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.032
-Thanks.
-Mm.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.540
(line rings)

16:47.574 --> 16:48.708
MALE MUTANT:
Hello?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.143
Hey. I'm calling from Atlanta.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.878
One of our friends
was going up there

16:51.911 --> 16:53.180
to pick up some supplies today.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.681
I can't reach him, so I just...

16:54.714 --> 16:56.216
Supplies?

16:56.249 --> 16:58.885
We, uh, we haven't had
supplies in weeks.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.855
As for your friend,
we haven't seen anyone all day.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.291
Oh.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.728
Son of a bitch.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.437
Here you go. I'm sorry,
we're short on blankets,

17:17.470 --> 17:20.407
so anyone who can share,
please share.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.211
And, um, well, we're working
on the food situation, so...

17:24.244 --> 17:25.212
Sonya.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.446
I need to talk to you.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.580
Privately.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.748
Yeah.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.217
Would you mind?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.185
Thank you. What is it?

17:32.219 --> 17:34.787
It's Marcos. He said
he was going up to Marietta

17:34.821 --> 17:37.557
-to get supplies.
-Well, did something go wrong?

17:37.590 --> 17:40.059
Yeah. He lied to us. Didn't go.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.362
They haven't heard from him, and
he's not answering his phone.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.730
I'm sure there's
a good explanation.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.064
Yeah, I got a good explanation.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.133
I searched our room--

17:46.166 --> 17:47.634
his Santa Muerte medallion
is gone.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.768
What is that?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.370
Patron saint of death.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.071
Big with the cartels.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.541
He used to wear it for luck...

17:54.574 --> 17:56.743
when he did that kind of work.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.744
(sighs)

17:57.777 --> 17:58.878
Okay.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.580
We have to find him.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.650
Tell me about this job.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.652
They've been having trouble

18:05.685 --> 18:07.654
with the Russians
moving into the area.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.556
We want to send a message.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.957
What kind of message?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.293
They have a shipment
going up north tomorrow.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.295
We know where
they load their trucks.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.464
We go there,
you deal with the shipment,

18:17.497 --> 18:19.299
and we're done.
Simple.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.100
I'm not killing anyone.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.236
Who said anything about killing?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.104
It's a shipment of drugs.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.473
You shine a little bit of light,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.074
boom-boom, nobody gets hurt.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.676
I'll even pay you.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.144
You can use the money

18:31.178 --> 18:32.679
to buy something nice
for your mutant friends.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.147
I hear it's pretty tight
over there.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.648
So, this job today,

18:35.682 --> 18:38.318
do I get the magic hands?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.854
Fine. For today.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.265
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I was just...

18:52.299 --> 18:55.134
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.636
I was in the basement.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.205
Some refugees needed
more towels.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.606
(softly):
Uh, yeah.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.140
Lauren, we need to talk to you.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.475
It's about Wes.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.012
You don't want me dating
a mutant.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.980
-I get it, okay? I...
-REED: No.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.148
No, you don't.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.850
Look at this.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.956
I've been going over the
criminal files, the ones we got

19:16.989 --> 19:18.024
from Baton Rouge.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.226
This is Wes's file.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.762
No, this isn't.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.299
This picture could be anyone.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
This is all the way up
in Cartersville.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.135
Lauren, you have to admit

19:29.168 --> 19:30.637
there's quite a resemblance.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.639
-You see what it lists
as his ability. -Yeah.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.907
-Image manipulation.
That's not proof. -How many

19:34.941 --> 19:37.344
other criminal mutants
do you think have that ability?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.045
Even if it is him,
we've all broken the law.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.747
-I mean, we've all...
-Running from Sentinel Services

19:40.780 --> 19:44.251
is one thing, but Wes conned
the owner of a jewelry store

19:44.284 --> 19:46.253
-for his own profit.
-You haven't changed.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.221
You ask all these questions
to prove you're right,

19:48.255 --> 19:49.856
-and you're just assuming
he's guilty! -I have

19:49.889 --> 19:51.190
some experience
in this area, Lauren,

19:51.224 --> 19:52.425
and I know
what I'm talking about.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.060
You have to look at this
with clear eyes!

19:54.093 --> 19:56.896
Just stop! Okay? Just shut up!

19:56.929 --> 19:58.531
Reed...

19:58.565 --> 20:00.600
(sighs)

20:00.633 --> 20:03.069
*

20:03.102 --> 20:05.505
(birds chirping)

20:05.538 --> 20:07.940
(thunder rolling)

20:07.974 --> 20:10.009
This road we're looking for,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.044
-do you remember anything
about it? -No, I don't.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.414
You're the one that saw it.
I was unconscious.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.215
Okay? I was hoping that I'd able

20:16.249 --> 20:18.751
-to find something about it
in the news, but... -Yeah, well,

20:18.785 --> 20:20.186
Sentinel Services is pretty good

20:20.219 --> 20:22.755
about covering up
mutant incidents, so...

20:24.424 --> 20:26.225
Well, then, I appreciate

20:26.259 --> 20:27.560
your little quest
for redemption,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.028
but obviously, this is useless.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.431
So take off
and chase your next scent,

20:31.464 --> 20:32.899
or do whatever it is you do.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.801
Clarice. Come on,
let me help you.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.869
No, you can't-- because
there's nothing to track,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.104
no trail to follow.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.272
Yeah, maybe, maybe not.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.875
You could have a trail
inside you.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.143
Aw, man, I'm not in the mood

20:44.176 --> 20:45.645
for some hippie
New Age talk right now.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.913
-All right?
-Listen to me.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.616
When an animal is hurt
or scared, their instinct

20:49.649 --> 20:52.251
is to take themselves
to... a place of safety--

20:52.285 --> 20:53.820
a nest, a burrow.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.755
I don't have a burrow, okay?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.123
Yeah, but you did.

20:57.156 --> 21:00.226
You had a place
where you felt loved

21:00.259 --> 21:02.228
and you felt safe.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.796
Clarice.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.198
Where was that?

21:10.169 --> 21:12.004
DOJ OFFICIAL:
Thank you all for coming in.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.442
I want to make sure there's no
confusion about where we stand.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.009
Dr. Campbell, I wanted you here

21:17.043 --> 21:18.911
because this concerns
your efforts as well.

21:18.945 --> 21:22.281
-Of course.
-This warrantless surveillance

21:22.315 --> 21:25.084
has strayed
well outside of legal bounds.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.754
We cannot deploy mutant assets
against suspects...

21:27.787 --> 21:30.022
Okay, can we
not mince words here?

21:30.056 --> 21:31.358
What the hell
are we talking about?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.925
We're pursuing terrorists.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.528
You mean people you suspect
of terrorism.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.763
American citizens...

21:36.796 --> 21:38.798
They protest our government,
they conspire

21:38.831 --> 21:40.467
with mutants in other countries,
they consider themselves

21:40.500 --> 21:42.168
to be a separate species.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.637
Why should they enjoy the rights
of American citizens

21:44.671 --> 21:47.640
when they're determined not
to act like American citizens?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.109
That argument was tried
on Catholics

21:50.142 --> 21:52.011
in the 1950s,
on Muslims in the 2000s,

21:52.044 --> 21:55.982
and the Supreme Court
shut it down every time.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.651
I'm requesting a court order
if you don't...

21:58.685 --> 22:01.688
-(coughing)
-Ma'am, are you okay?

22:01.721 --> 22:02.989
...if you don't...

22:04.491 --> 22:07.560
-(grunting)
-What...

22:07.594 --> 22:08.995
(coughing)

22:09.028 --> 22:10.897
(distorted, indistinct talking)

22:13.099 --> 22:14.967
(grunting weakly)

22:15.001 --> 22:17.704
(excited chatter, gasping)

22:17.737 --> 22:20.473
-Call 911.
-(gasping)

22:20.507 --> 22:22.842
I'm a doctor. She appears
to be having a stroke.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.711
Let's give her a little room.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.646
-(groaning) -Let's get
an ambulance here right away.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.915
(groaning continues)

22:38.224 --> 22:40.126
(phone beeping)

22:44.564 --> 22:46.666
What can I do for you,
Agent Turner?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.768
For starters, you can tell me
what the hell happened

22:48.801 --> 22:50.537
-in the conference room today.
-With our associate

22:50.570 --> 22:52.204
from the DOJ?

22:52.238 --> 22:54.407
Well, it's going to be hard
to tell without an MRI.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.776
My guess, she burst
a blood vessel in her brain.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.344
She'll live, but...

22:58.377 --> 23:00.880
No, Doctor,
I mean, what happened?

23:00.913 --> 23:04.250
Well, I think
that's pretty clear, don't you?

23:04.283 --> 23:06.686
Our bureaucratic friend suffered
an unfortunate medical incident.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.089
So, you're saying
it was a... coincidence.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.591
I'm saying it was convenient.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.059
And it was damn suspicious.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.562
How so? You were making a case
for our program.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.063
I saved a woman's life.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.698
I think it's time to move on.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.968
Listen. They're not just
gonna leave us alone, okay?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.703
The DOJ will just send
somebody else.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.472
CAMPBELL:
Maybe, in a few weeks.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.974
Meanwhile, our work can proceed.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.242
-Listen, this is not...
-I have to say, Agent Turner,

23:30.276 --> 23:31.611
I liked your passion in there.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.113
Grace would have been proud.

23:46.493 --> 23:49.261
I think I've gotten everything

23:49.295 --> 23:51.564
there is to get
out of these files.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.633
How's the second drive coming?

23:53.666 --> 23:58.337
I'm calculating relationships of
asymmetrical algorithmic keys.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.072
Okay.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.475
I'm getting there.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.443
(indistinct chatter)

24:06.546 --> 24:09.649
You're in charge of evaluating
people when they come in, right?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.317
SAGE:
Yeah.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.019
How do you choose who to let in?

24:13.052 --> 24:15.121
I mean,
there's so many mutants here

24:15.154 --> 24:17.289
-who are running from the law.
-There are things

24:17.323 --> 24:19.158
we don't forgive-- murder, rape,

24:19.191 --> 24:20.827
victimizing other mutants.
Other than that,

24:20.860 --> 24:22.762
we just ask people
to tell the truth.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.997
What if they don't?

24:25.031 --> 24:26.633
Then they have to leave.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.400
This place is built on trust.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.641
Why?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.044
Just curious.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.522
(video game beeping)

24:54.060 --> 24:56.028
Hi.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.364
-Hey.
-Have a sec?

24:58.397 --> 25:00.667
Yeah. Found this
behind the books.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.936
Saved me
from actually reading one.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.640
What's wrong?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.876
I have to ask you something.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.913
It's probably nothing, but
my dad showed me a police file.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.515
There's someone in it
who's wanted for some crimes.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.417
He thinks it might be you.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.319
Seriously?

25:20.352 --> 25:24.256
The police description says
something about...

25:24.290 --> 25:26.593
image manipulation.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.161
It did? How-How's that?

25:29.195 --> 25:33.432
Wes, if it is you,
I need to know.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.042
It's true.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.179
-Lauren, uh...
-No.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.448
Please, just... let me explain.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.918
After my parents kicked me out,
I was a mess.

25:51.951 --> 25:56.022
I was living in shelters,
eating out of Dumpsters, and...

25:56.055 --> 25:58.557
and this-this group of guys
found me,

25:58.591 --> 26:00.259
and they let me join their crew.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.394
I was just their front man,
covering things up,

26:02.428 --> 26:04.230
-tricking people. I didn't...
-You were telling me

26:04.263 --> 26:07.233
not to hide, making it seem
like you used your powers

26:07.266 --> 26:08.635
all the time because you were
proud of who you were.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.069
This is what you meant?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.238
No, no, no.
I-I was desperate back then.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.539
You should have told me.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.942
You got to trust me.

26:15.975 --> 26:19.411
Trust you? Wes, how can
I believe anything that you say?

26:21.113 --> 26:25.051
You're just like one
of your stupid mirages.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.654
Lauren!

26:48.374 --> 26:50.509
Remind you of the good old days?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.178
Reminds me of the old days.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.013
-I don't know
how good they were. -This stuff

26:54.046 --> 26:55.815
used to give you a rush.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.684
You'd come home
and keep me up all night.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.787
I was just excited
to have a roof over my head.

27:00.820 --> 27:05.157
You can tell yourself that if
you want, but I know the truth.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.459
I remember when you were just
Marcos who loved

27:07.493 --> 27:10.129
-to burn things.
-People evolve, Carmen.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.597
They find something
to believe in.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.966
Spare me the noble speech.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.302
All you ever believed in
was magnet girl.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.940
Where are we going, exactly?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.642
The Russian lab is
in Forest Hills.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.979
We'll go there, we deal with the
guards, and you do your thing.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.314
Well, deal with the guards?
I said no killing.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.216
Calmate, Marcos.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.185
Lodo will handle the guards.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.654
You deal with the cargo
and stay out of my way.

27:35.688 --> 27:38.124
CARMEN:
Come on, be friendly.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
He is one of you.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.694
Come on.

27:45.064 --> 27:49.535
This kind of looks familiar, but
all these roads look the same.

27:49.568 --> 27:52.705
What did the house look like
where you grew up?

27:52.739 --> 27:54.741
I don't know. One story.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.475
Not too big.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.310
It was a home
for mutant foster kids.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.412
The ones
who couldn't pass as human.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.881
I was only there
for a couple years,

28:01.914 --> 28:03.315
back when I was supposed
to be in high school.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.551
-Why'd you leave?
-The couple who ran it,

28:05.584 --> 28:08.821
you know, they took good care
of us, but their idea

28:08.855 --> 28:11.423
of keeping us safe was
to hide us away forever.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.426
Which really sucks
when you're 15.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.597
Wait. That looks familiar.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.002
I remember this gate.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.072
(gate creaks open)

28:28.207 --> 28:30.542
That's the farmhouse.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.023
Clarice? Maybe you should

28:44.056 --> 28:45.524
-wait here.
-What? Why?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.794
I think something bad happened.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.601
Oh, God. Oh, no. Get us in now.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.942
(door squeaks open)

29:05.311 --> 29:07.546
Carl?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.415
Denise?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.317
Sentinel Services probably
searched all the houses

29:11.350 --> 29:13.685
in the area.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.624
Maybe they got away. Right?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.938
Clarice, I'm sorry.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.611
Oh, man.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.948
(crying)

29:47.186 --> 29:49.155
No, no.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.790
No. (exhales loudly)

29:55.461 --> 29:57.629
Are you sure about this?

29:57.663 --> 29:59.331
Probably not smart
to pick a fight

29:59.365 --> 30:00.833
with the cartel
if we don't have to.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.768
Trust me, we have to.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.637
If Marcos came here,
he's in serious trouble.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.374
This is a bad idea.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.514
Excuse me?

30:15.547 --> 30:16.849
-Got a moment?
-MAN: Hey, ladies.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.384
Looking good.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.019
There something
I can help you with?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.054
(whooshing)

30:22.088 --> 30:23.890
-(groaning)
-Hey!

30:23.923 --> 30:26.325
-(whooshing)
-Whoa!

30:26.358 --> 30:27.894
(whooshing)

30:27.927 --> 30:30.529
(grunting)

30:30.562 --> 30:33.699
So, I'm looking for Marcos Diaz
and Carmen Guerra.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.667
-Where'd they go?
-I got no idea.

30:35.701 --> 30:39.705
Oh. Well, let's see
if we can help you remember.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.340
-(groans)
-(alarm sounding)

30:41.373 --> 30:43.809
Loosen the strap a little.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.411
He needs to breathe.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.513
-(whooshing)
-(man groans softly)

30:54.086 --> 30:56.022
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

30:58.790 --> 30:59.791
Hey.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.629
Hey.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.233
I was looking for Lauren,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.768
but I think she's avoiding me.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.738
Very perceptive, Counselor.

31:16.475 --> 31:20.579
I always knew we were gonna
be arguing over curfews,

31:20.612 --> 31:22.881
or trying
to keep the wrong guys away,

31:22.915 --> 31:25.317
but... this?

31:27.453 --> 31:29.121
I didn't see this coming.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.623
Mm. It feels like
with all that's happened,

31:31.657 --> 31:35.861
everything should just... stop,

31:35.894 --> 31:39.465
but our kids keep growing up.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.868
I just want to protect her.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.171
I know.

31:48.174 --> 31:53.612
We were blind to so much about
the world, about... our family.

31:56.148 --> 31:59.585
That's why Lauren hid herself
from us.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.989
I can't change the past.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.656
I know.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.359
But right now,
she doesn't need a prosecutor.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.630
She needs a dad.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.871
(Caitlin sniffles)

32:31.717 --> 32:34.486
(birds singing)

32:36.122 --> 32:38.490
REED:
Hey.

32:38.524 --> 32:41.360
Oh, sorry. I-I know
we're supposed to be inside.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.030
It's nice out here.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.435
I know you probably hate me.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.770
I don't hate you.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.305
And what I think doesn't matter
as much

32:53.339 --> 32:54.706
as what Lauren thinks, anyway.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.244
You mind if I sit?

33:01.347 --> 33:03.149
Yeah, go ahead.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.717
All my life,
I've been enforcing laws.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.789
The way I saw it,

33:10.822 --> 33:12.391
society only worked

33:12.424 --> 33:15.527
if there were consequences
for breaking the rules.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.230
Lately, my feelings about
society have changed a bit,

33:18.264 --> 33:22.368
but... it's something
I still believe in.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.471
Maybe in a new way,
but I do believe it.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.206
It's about trust.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.844
What you did was wrong, Wes.
You know that, right?

33:32.878 --> 33:35.914
Yeah.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.250
What'd they say
when you told them?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.353
I haven't told them.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.194
You have a choice to make, Wes.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.596
You can hope
they don't find out.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.464
Or you can tell them,
and take your chances.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.768
But I'm gonna leave it
in your hands.

34:13.152 --> 34:16.122
I found whatever traces I could.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.923
Looks like they died

34:17.956 --> 34:19.791
defending some of the foster
kids that were living there.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.593
My portals brought
everyone here.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.962
-This is all my fault.
-No, it's not your fault.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.597
Sentinel Services
pulled the trigger.

34:26.965 --> 34:28.534
You cared about them.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.537
I'm sorry.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.573
-(Blink crying)
-I'm sorry.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.786
You know what I said earlier
about this not being my fight?

34:49.921 --> 34:52.424
I don't know if it was before,

34:52.458 --> 34:54.460
but it sure as hell is now.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.034
ECLIPSE:
How much longer?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.972
CARMEN: We wait until
all the drugs come out.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.307
Then we go in.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.579
You always used to
get like this, remember?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.481
Then you'd go in and do the job,

35:15.514 --> 35:18.717
and we couldn't stop you
until everything was burning.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.789
There we go.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.625
(snaps fingers)

35:40.372 --> 35:42.974
(indistinct shouting)

35:49.014 --> 35:50.916
(brakes squeal)

36:10.769 --> 36:12.204
(growls)

36:34.025 --> 36:36.428
That was perfect, mi amor.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.244
Let's go.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.845
-Wait, don't you want to talk?
-No.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.781
He can save himself.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.667
(footsteps approaching)

37:21.273 --> 37:23.174
(Eclipse sighs)

37:26.077 --> 37:27.913
Hey.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.316
Babe, I'm sorry I'm late.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.650
How was Marietta?

37:31.683 --> 37:32.784
It was fine.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.720
Oh, they just had some delay,

37:34.753 --> 37:36.788
so I had to wait a bit, but I
got what they could give us.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.625
And uh, I ran down
an old contact,

37:39.658 --> 37:41.259
explained our situation,

37:41.293 --> 37:43.495
uh, managed to get us some cash.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.096
Should be enough to keep
the lights on a few weeks.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.632
An "old contact"?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.601
Yeah. Yes, a supporter of
the cause, you know.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.038
Yeah. I know.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.945
So how's Carmen doing?

37:59.978 --> 38:01.347
Okay.
Babe, you don't understand.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.682
I saw you with her. I think
I understand perfectly.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.617
No, you don't.
When you were in jail,

38:05.651 --> 38:08.354
the only way I could get to you
was to go to Carmen.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.188
For information. But I had
to agree to work for her.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.289
And you weren't going to mention
this to me?

38:11.323 --> 38:13.692
-It just never came up?
-I did this for you.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.293
And for our baby.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.028
The only reason
I kept it from you

38:17.062 --> 38:19.264
is because I just...
I didn't know how to tell you.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.733
Lorna, I didn't know.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.472
Well, now you've told me.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.007
(medallion clatters on floor)

38:29.040 --> 38:31.843
Lorna...

38:31.877 --> 38:34.045
(sighs)

38:41.987 --> 38:44.623
Hey, um, sorry to interrupt.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.059
This will just take a second.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.562
Go ahead.

38:50.596 --> 38:53.131
Actually, you can all hear this.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.466
I just wanted to let you know

38:54.500 --> 38:56.134
that I spoke to Sage
and the others.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.170
Told them about all the stuff
that I did.

38:59.204 --> 39:02.307
-Really?
-Yeah.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.675
Told them that
it was all behind me,

39:03.709 --> 39:05.577
and that I was gonna be

39:05.611 --> 39:06.578
a better guy from now on.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.380
Anyway, they discussed it,

39:08.414 --> 39:09.981
and they decided
to cut me some slack.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.083
I'm sorry.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.452
Thanks for the talk.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.390
-So you can stay?
-Actually, there's a group going

39:18.424 --> 39:20.058
to Augusta station tomorrow.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.860
They asked me to join them.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.062
Then you're leaving?

39:24.095 --> 39:26.264
Yeah.

39:26.297 --> 39:28.834
Sorry for interrupting

39:28.867 --> 39:30.969
and have a lovely dinner.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.477
*

39:41.913 --> 39:45.584
* Wake up high on it

39:45.617 --> 39:48.720
* Feel it suspending

39:49.821 --> 39:52.458
* I'm enamored *

39:52.491 --> 39:54.526
* Way up in the sky

39:54.560 --> 39:57.095
* I can see that you want to

39:57.128 --> 39:58.464
* I've been *

39:58.497 --> 40:01.399
* A romantic

40:01.433 --> 40:05.103
* For so long

40:05.136 --> 40:07.473
* All I've ever heard *

40:07.506 --> 40:09.575
* Are love songs

40:10.642 --> 40:11.943
* Singing

40:11.977 --> 40:14.913
* Oh, oh-oh

40:14.946 --> 40:17.449
* Go on, I dare you

40:19.284 --> 40:22.220
* Oh, oh-oh

40:22.253 --> 40:24.189
* I dare you

40:26.925 --> 40:29.961
* I get chills

40:29.995 --> 40:33.098
* Heart rate multiplies

40:33.131 --> 40:36.668
* I'm on a different *

40:36.702 --> 40:40.906
* Kind of high

40:40.939 --> 40:44.743
* A rush of blood

40:44.776 --> 40:48.914
* Is not enough

40:48.947 --> 40:52.117
* I need my feelings

40:52.150 --> 40:55.654
* Set on fire

40:59.124 --> 41:02.260
* Now I'm deep in it *

41:02.293 --> 41:05.931
* Infatuated

41:05.964 --> 41:08.800
* Strong attraction

41:08.834 --> 41:10.669
* Side by side

41:10.702 --> 41:13.004
* And I know that you want to

41:13.038 --> 41:15.607
* Oh, oh-oh

41:15.641 --> 41:18.544
* Go on, I dare you

41:19.678 --> 41:23.014
* Oh, oh-oh

41:23.048 --> 41:24.816
* I dare you

41:28.687 --> 41:30.455
* I can hear it now

41:30.488 --> 41:31.923
* Like I heard it then

41:35.093 --> 41:36.895
* I can hear it now

41:36.928 --> 41:39.130
* Like I heard it then.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.567
I was able to get past most of
the drive's security.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.368
I'm still sorting through it,

41:43.401 --> 41:45.036
but it looks like it's mostly
information on mutants

41:45.070 --> 41:47.673
-who were sent into the program.
-Was Pulse in there?

41:47.706 --> 41:50.008
It looks like he was
one of the first.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.511
-Was there anything about
that location, or... ? -No.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.013
Nothing. All we have

41:55.046 --> 41:57.015
is the courthouse's records
of who was selected.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.650
It doesn't say anything
about where they went.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.151
REED: But if it's run by
the Sentinel Services,

42:00.185 --> 42:01.753
there has to be a record.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.021
It's a government program.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.556
No. I don't think it is.

42:04.590 --> 42:05.724
What do you mean?

42:05.757 --> 42:08.226
It's not run by the government.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.995
It's a private
military contractor,

42:10.028 --> 42:11.396
Trask Industries.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.932
Trask Industries?

42:13.965 --> 42:16.602
They shut down in '06.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.936
How do you know that?

42:19.638 --> 42:22.073
My father worked there
for 35 years.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.977
Your father worked for Trask?

42:27.946 --> 42:30.481
You think he has something
to do with all this?

42:32.250 --> 42:36.221
(scoffs)
I don't know.

42:36.254 --> 42:39.524
I don't know anything anymore.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.693
It's an exciting time,
Agent Turner.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.729
It's a very exciting time.

42:43.762 --> 42:45.096
We've started with the assets

42:45.130 --> 42:46.431
who can target the
Underground immediately.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.266
You really think
this is gonna work?

42:48.299 --> 42:50.368
I mean, we've been trying
to place spies for years.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.203
Don't think of 'em as spies.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.272
More like weapons.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.574
All if we have to do
is get 'em inside.

42:56.608 --> 42:58.977
The Hounds will take it
from there.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.939
Agent Turner,

43:27.973 --> 43:32.911
we may finally be in a position
to win this war.

44:24.562 --> 44:28.299

Mutant education is a challenge,

but it doesn't have to
be a crisis.

44:52.958 --> 44:56.427
When our daughter...
changed,

44:56.461 --> 44:58.596
we needed answers.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.766
We found Empower Academy.

45:00.799 --> 45:04.602
I didn't know what to do
when my powers manifested.

45:04.635 --> 45:07.939
I was scared for myself...
and for my family.

45:09.274 --> 45:12.343
With the tools that I learned
at Empower Academy,

45:12.377 --> 45:15.080
I know that I don't
have to live as a mutant.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.816
I am more than my power.
