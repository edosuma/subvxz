00:04.890 --> 00:07.240
14 people were assassinated
this morning,

00:07.280 --> 00:08.680
including three CIA agents.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.476
The victims killed
this morning were part of

00:10.500 --> 00:12.900
a task force targeting
Mikhail Tal's finances.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.330
Mikhail Vassily Tal,

00:14.380 --> 00:16.096
one of the greatest threats
to America today.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.640
In 2015, using Erica Shepherd,

00:18.690 --> 00:20.510
Tal assassinated four operatives

00:20.560 --> 00:22.626
and he's planning an attack on
American lives as we speak.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.340
I wanna bring in Erica Shepherd.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.066
She killed my fiancé.
Did you forget that?

00:26.090 --> 00:29.090
I didn't work with Tal.
I didn't spy for him.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.180
I made a choice
to save my daughter.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.880
That's the woman Nemec
was putting in his car.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.490
She's alive.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.286
Anna Cruz is out there alone
and in danger.

00:37.310 --> 00:38.840
We find her
and we bring her home.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.540
You're safe now.
You're safe.

00:43.150 --> 00:44.710
Does the FBI suspect anything?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.110
No, nothing.

00:46.150 --> 00:48.150
Your plan worked perfectly,
Mikhail.

00:48.190 --> 00:50.070
I'm in.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:13.130 --> 01:15.090
Uh, we can do that...

01:16.440 --> 01:17.700
Let me help you with that.

01:17.750 --> 01:18.880
Oh, thank you.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.710
- My pleasure. Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.750
Should be at my desk
in an hour or so.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.140
Call you then?

01:24.190 --> 01:25.970
Great. Okay, love you.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.070
Attention travelers,

01:35.110 --> 01:37.420
Metro Car's self-serving
kiosks are available at...

01:37.460 --> 01:39.810
- Did we miss it?
- It's coming right now.

01:40.550 --> 01:41.940
Your attention, please.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.860
The Eastern Seaboard
regional train

01:43.900 --> 01:46.210
and service to Richmond is now
approaching the station.

01:50.950 --> 01:53.430
Ashland station.
Next stop, Richmond.

01:54.650 --> 01:56.130
Stand clear of the doors,
please.

02:21.030 --> 02:22.460
I need the laptop in your bag

02:22.510 --> 02:24.550
and the password
to your IVS account.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.300
Don't make this difficult.

02:31.340 --> 02:32.910
Hey, I'm getting robbed here!

02:33.910 --> 02:35.740
Stop, police!

02:35.780 --> 02:37.260
What's going on?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.260
Hey!

02:47.660 --> 02:48.920
Oh!

03:02.550 --> 03:04.330
He tried to rob me!

03:13.080 --> 03:15.690
I locked him out!

03:16.950 --> 03:18.740
No! Don't let him in!

03:32.320 --> 03:35.270
Your laptop and password now.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.840
All right, stone91.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.180
- Daniel, Kate, we're up.
- What's going on?

04:07.220 --> 04:09.456
Two people were killed on
a commuter train this morning

04:09.480 --> 04:11.010
outside Richmond.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.620
The target was former CIA,

04:12.660 --> 04:14.140
a man by the name
of Dean Merriman.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.620
And you think Tal's behind this?

04:15.660 --> 04:17.596
Can't be sure, but it's
another dead CIA operative,

04:17.620 --> 04:20.190
killed within 48 hours
of Tal's last attacks.

04:20.230 --> 04:22.840
I'm having Bragg reach out
to our counterparts at Langley.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.776
See if he can get some
information on the victims.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.240
Kate, where are you
with Nemec's recovered cell?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.346
Almost done analyzing it.

04:28.370 --> 04:29.760
Let me know the second you are.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.420
Daniel, when you question
Nemec today,

04:31.460 --> 04:33.356
see what he can tell you
about today's shootings.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.200
Understood.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.900
You're going to
the holding cell?

04:37.900 --> 04:40.120
- Yes, I am.
- To get Shepherd?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.300
Shepherd's worked
for the CIA for 16 years.

04:42.340 --> 04:43.836
And she's been in prison
for the last three.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.780
Conspiracy against
the United States, homicide...

04:45.820 --> 04:47.430
Yeah, I know exactly
what she's done.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.220
Then why are you
still working with her?

04:49.260 --> 04:51.350
Because Anna Cruz
is still alive.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.270
Viktor Nemec,
one of Tal's top lieutenants,

04:53.310 --> 04:54.960
is in custody because of her.

04:55.010 --> 04:56.180
That's why.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.490
Keaton.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.010
Just got off the phone
with Langley.

04:59.050 --> 05:02.620
Listen to this, Dean Merriman
wasn't just former CIA.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.970
He was one
of Erica Shepherd's operatives.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.560
You look like hell.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.570
I didn't get much sleep.

05:33.610 --> 05:35.830
I'm guessing
it's not the new cell.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.230
Why are you here?

05:41.270 --> 05:43.010
There was an attack
early this morning.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.540
The target was
your former operative,

05:45.580 --> 05:47.410
Dean Merriman.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.020
That mean anything to you?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.890
Only that it's Tal.

05:56.070 --> 05:57.420
What did Anna Cruz tell you?

05:57.460 --> 05:58.980
Nothing yet.

05:59.030 --> 06:00.590
She spent the night
in a hospital.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.290
She could be the key
to finding Tal.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.600
What are you waiting for?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.380
She's a 26-year-old
junior analyst

06:05.420 --> 06:08.820
who was kidnapped and held at
gunpoint for the last two days.

06:08.860 --> 06:11.210
You really think it's smart
to question her right now?

06:11.260 --> 06:12.520
Besides, she's CIA.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.820
Her people need to be present

06:13.870 --> 06:15.300
in order for us to question her.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.570
Who's coming?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.440
Deputy director by
the name of Cabrera.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.440
Why? You know him?

06:20.480 --> 06:23.440
You're asking the
wrong questions, Agent Keaton.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.766
There's something
you're overlooking

06:25.790 --> 06:27.660
in the Tal investigation.
And what's that?

06:27.710 --> 06:30.060
Mikhail Tal's is potentially
one of the deadliest enemies

06:30.100 --> 06:31.890
we've ever faced.

06:31.930 --> 06:34.036
Thousands of his operatives
have infested this country.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.680
They are living and working
and sleeping beside us.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.110
He not only wants to take out

06:40.150 --> 06:42.030
as many American lives
as possible,

06:42.070 --> 06:44.940
but he also wants to destroy
the US intelligence apparatus.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.786
All because when he was
Russian intelligence,

06:46.810 --> 06:48.550
a U.S. Air strike
killed his brothers.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.536
Revenge is a powerful
motivator, wouldn't you say?

06:50.560 --> 06:52.300
Yeah, but you don't know how.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.950
You have no clue what he's
planning to carry out next.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.740
No.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.780
What about his lieutenant,
Viktor Nemec?

07:00.830 --> 07:02.180
Have you questioned him?

07:02.220 --> 07:03.570
Daniel's upstairs prepping now,

07:03.610 --> 07:05.440
which is why I'm here.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.450
You're going to sit in
on the interrogation.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.060
You want me to help you?

07:12.100 --> 07:15.360
On the Tal investigation, yes.

07:15.410 --> 07:17.980
Everything else, no.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.930
Understood?

07:19.980 --> 07:21.410
Not at all.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.680
I won't help you,

07:31.770 --> 07:34.120
I won't cooperate with you.

07:35.210 --> 07:37.520
Not until I know that
my daughter is safe.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.300
You of all people know
how ruthless Tal can be.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.650
I want to catch him.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.740
I want to make him pay
for destroying my life,

07:43.780 --> 07:44.960
but I won't do it if it means

07:45.000 --> 07:47.180
putting my daughter's life
in danger.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.440
I want her to have
FBI protection,

07:50.490 --> 07:52.490
otherwise you can send me
back to prison.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.620
I'll get her protection.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.540
But I need you
to help me catch Tal.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.070
Keep my daughter safe...

08:10.110 --> 08:11.990
I'll help you kill him.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.820
So how are you feeling?

08:24.870 --> 08:28.610
Okay. A little sore
from the car crash.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.310
- Sorry about that.
- Don't be.

08:30.350 --> 08:31.740
You did it to save my life.

08:31.790 --> 08:33.880
Listen, we appreciate
you coming to speak with us.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.596
I just wanna make sure
that you're up for it.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.270
- I am.
- Not just physically.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.556
What you went through, I... I
know it wasn't easy for you.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.539
And you're good
to look out for me.

08:42.630 --> 08:44.840
But I wanna help.
I'm ready.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.190
Good.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.370
Deputy Cabrera.
Will Keaton.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.566
If you just follow me to
my office, we can get started.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.640
I need a word first,
Agent Keaton.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.510
- About what?
- Erica Shepherd.

08:55.550 --> 08:57.290
Some questions about her escape.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.600
Yes, yes,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.136
that was a security breach
during transport,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.860
but she was recovered
almost immediately.

09:01.910 --> 09:04.210
What was she doing in D.C.
in the first place?

09:04.260 --> 09:05.976
You know, I think this is
a conversation that

09:06.000 --> 09:09.090
you might have to have with
someone else at the Bureau.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.700
You're working with her,
aren't you?

09:14.270 --> 09:15.700
I am, yes.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.546
Four of my colleagues
are dead because of her

09:17.570 --> 09:19.010
including your fiancé.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.946
I know who Shepherd is,
I know exactly what she did

09:20.970 --> 09:22.580
and I am working with her
because of it.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.230
I'm going to catch Tal,
Deputy Cabrera,

09:25.280 --> 09:27.280
but I'm going to do it
the way I see fit.

09:28.630 --> 09:29.850
Where is she?

09:42.120 --> 09:45.040
- Let's go, Anna.
- What are you talking about?

09:45.080 --> 09:46.706
The CIA is not cooperating
with a traitor.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.600
Cruz is a witness in an ongoing

09:48.650 --> 09:49.970
counterintelligence
investigation.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.430
So subpoena her.
Let's go, Anna.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.390
Wait.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.570
My friends were murdered.

09:56.610 --> 10:00.350
They were good people
with families and children,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.270
and now they're dead
because of Mikhail Tal.

10:03.310 --> 10:06.750
I want to help them.
I want justice.

10:07.930 --> 10:09.630
Please let me stay.

10:17.330 --> 10:19.550
You have no idea
what she's capable of.

10:19.590 --> 10:22.510
I can't stop you from working
with her, Agent Keaton,

10:22.550 --> 10:24.250
but I trusted that woman.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.210
I put my life in her hands
and I'm telling you this...

10:28.250 --> 10:31.390
You can't believe
a word Eric Shepherd says.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.370
Viktor Nemec's cell.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.810
I ran multiple scans
of the phone.

11:04.850 --> 11:06.680
Call log searches, internet use,

11:06.730 --> 11:09.030
location tracking.
Nothing.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.950
I knew Nemec was using this cell

11:10.990 --> 11:14.730
to communicate with Tal,
but I couldn't figure out how.

11:14.780 --> 11:15.910
Then it clicked.

11:15.950 --> 11:18.390
He was using a mesh network.

11:18.430 --> 11:20.000
Traditional data networks

11:20.040 --> 11:23.180
rely on a small number
of centralized access points.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.000
Cell phone towers, for example.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.140
Right, which is why
they are easy to monitor,

11:27.180 --> 11:29.750
but mesh networks
are made up of dozens,

11:29.790 --> 11:32.880
if not hundreds,
of tiny wireless nodes.

11:32.930 --> 11:36.760
Think of it as some sort
of underground AT&T.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.630
Only completely decentralized.

11:38.670 --> 11:39.776
Which means we can't search it.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.190
Not exactly.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.916
I know that Nemec
was communicating with Tal

11:42.940 --> 11:44.500
on this network,

11:44.550 --> 11:46.396
but there's no way to find out
what was being said.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.770
There's more information
you can get from mesh networks.

11:48.810 --> 11:50.030
Like what?

11:50.070 --> 11:51.510
How many users
are on the network,

11:51.550 --> 11:53.470
their location, how often
they're communicating.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.860
The CIA doesn't just monitor
democratic uprising.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.250
Sometimes we facilitate them.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.040
How many users
are on this network?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.130
Seven.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.650
When did they stop
communicating?

12:01.690 --> 12:03.350
They haven't.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.780
Three of Tal's operatives are
using the network right now.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.350
And just this morning,

12:07.390 --> 12:10.350
chatter on the network
has spiked more than 200%.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.010
Tal's not done.

12:12.050 --> 12:13.750
He's just getting started.

12:37.160 --> 12:41.520
Viktor Nemec? I'm FBI
Special Agent Daniel Zain.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.650
We know you're operating
on behalf of Mikhail Tal.

12:43.690 --> 12:44.976
We know that you kidnapped
Anna Cruz.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.390
It's not what I'm here
to talk to you about.

12:48.090 --> 12:49.390
You see, just over an hour ago,

12:49.440 --> 12:52.090
two people were killed by
Tal's operatives.

12:58.530 --> 13:01.140
Innocent lives have been taken,
Viktor.

13:01.190 --> 13:03.020
Even more are at risk.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.840
Basically,
some pretty serious charges.

13:05.890 --> 13:07.770
- This won't work.
- I want to help you, Viktor.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.110
Daniel's our best
interrogator at the Bureau.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.720
Tal's operatives never talk.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.500
Not to you, they don't.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.420
He's planning something else,
isn't he?

13:18.860 --> 13:19.900
Okay.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.860
Viktor? Viktor.

13:25.910 --> 13:28.870
I have a rule when
it comes to interrogations.

13:28.910 --> 13:31.910
I never lie to my subjects.
It's true.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.520
See, if I lie
to you and you find out,

13:33.570 --> 13:35.270
you'll never believe another
word I say.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.220
So, the truth.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.970
There's no way out of this
for you; there's no reprieve.

13:40.010 --> 13:41.556
You're going to spend
the rest of your life

13:41.580 --> 13:43.530
in a maximum security
federal detention center

13:43.580 --> 13:45.190
unless you help us stop Tal

13:45.230 --> 13:47.890
and the assassins on that train.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.250
It's early, but, uh,
I think I can get him to turn.

14:00.290 --> 14:01.900
What do you need
to make it happen?

14:01.940 --> 14:02.770
Time.

14:02.810 --> 14:04.560
Well, give him what you can.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.276
Right now, he's our best chance
at catching Tal.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.276
In the meantime, why don't
you head over to Richmond.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.740
Question the witnesses
regarding the Merriman attack.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.040
Early reports said
there are two shooters,

14:13.090 --> 14:15.220
a conductor
and a passenger on board.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.390
See if you can see
if anybody else was with them.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.050
Yeah, you got it.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.580
Hold, please.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.290
I checked for cameras
on the train.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.640
- And?
- There weren't any,

14:43.680 --> 14:45.120
but there are cameras
in the station

14:45.160 --> 14:46.640
where the trip originated.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.226
So I have field agents pulling
the footage now

14:48.250 --> 14:50.080
and then, hopefully,
I can crosscheck that

14:50.120 --> 14:51.080
and we can ID the gunmen.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.600
You are wasting time.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.496
Finding Merriman's killer
won't get you closer to Tal.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.780
So you're saying that we
should just not go after them?

14:56.820 --> 14:58.480
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.960
And what about the people
who were murdered this morning?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.676
It's not your job to care
about the victims,

15:02.700 --> 15:04.596
it's your job to catch Tal.
So if you wanna do that,

15:04.620 --> 15:06.100
you need to focus on
what's important.

15:06.140 --> 15:07.360
And what would that be?

15:07.400 --> 15:08.816
The reason why Merriman
was killed.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.596
You need to stop thinking
of Tal as a terrorist

15:10.620 --> 15:12.670
and start thinking of him
as an operative.

15:12.710 --> 15:13.930
His actions aren't random

15:13.970 --> 15:15.630
and neither
was Merriman's death.

15:15.670 --> 15:18.890
So if you can find out what
he had that got him killed,

15:18.930 --> 15:22.720
then you might have
a chance at stopping Tal.

15:24.370 --> 15:26.330
Kate, see if you can
track down the gunmen.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.120
Thank you.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.640
So Merriman had been retired
from the CIA for three years.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.170
Why did Tal kill him?

15:33.210 --> 15:35.170
I don't know, but I know
where to start looking.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.650
Where?

15:36.690 --> 15:38.496
Most covert operatives
have a place where they hide

15:38.520 --> 15:40.560
passports and cash, intel...
A stash house, yes.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.520
I know what that is.
Where's Merriman's?

15:42.570 --> 15:45.310
In a storage unit in Baltimore.

15:45.350 --> 15:46.660
And how do you know that?

15:46.700 --> 15:48.660
I was his boss.
It was my job to know.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.840
Give me the address.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.166
I need to be there
when you search it.

15:53.190 --> 15:54.726
No, not a chance.
I'll find it myself.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.280
You just tell me
what to look for.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.556
Well, I don't know what to
look for. Not until I see it.

15:58.580 --> 16:01.540
That's why I need to be there.

16:01.590 --> 16:03.850
I'm one woman
in a pair of handcuffs.

16:03.890 --> 16:05.500
What are you scared of?

16:35.180 --> 16:36.970
You sure about this?

16:37.010 --> 16:39.036
Last time we let her out
of the building, she escaped.

16:39.060 --> 16:42.150
I have an agent monitoring
the GPS transponder

16:42.190 --> 16:44.540
implanted into her chest.

16:46.590 --> 16:49.890
But if she tries
to escape again,

16:49.940 --> 16:52.070
shoot her.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.180
You, uh, you say
you saw the conductor

17:16.230 --> 17:17.920
talking with a man
before departure?

17:17.970 --> 17:19.839
- That's right.
- Did that man board the train?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.010
No, I'm sure of it.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.296
Where did you see them together?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.930
Near the last car on the train.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.736
I thought it was odd
because there were people

17:25.760 --> 17:27.150
who needed help boarding

17:27.190 --> 17:29.110
and the conductor
just stood there talking.

17:29.150 --> 17:30.150
Okay, thank you.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.250
This is it.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:52.570 --> 17:55.390
Merriman's unit is this way.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.400
Excuse me, you work here?

18:01.440 --> 18:02.750
I'm the building manager.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.490
I'm FBI Special Agent
Will Keaton.

18:04.530 --> 18:06.450
I need to get inside
the storage unit.

18:06.490 --> 18:07.800
Can you help me with that?

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
Yeah.

18:23.550 --> 18:25.340
Damn, what is all this?

18:26.210 --> 18:27.910
A lifetime of intelligence work.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.130
How many lives
did this guy live?

18:31.080 --> 18:33.016
Bragg, why don't you start on
that side of the room?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.220
I'll dig in over here.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.570
All right.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.180
I need to ask you something.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.230
The cuffs stay on.

18:43.270 --> 18:45.400
It's not that.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.400
Hannah.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.190
I need to see her.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.840
- I'll think about it.
- It's been three years.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.200
I'll think about it.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.110
Hi Daniel, what's up?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.786
A witness saw a conductor
talking to a man

19:04.810 --> 19:06.340
before departure
at Richmond station.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.300
I think he might've been
one of Tal's operatives.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.640
I'll check
surveillance footage now.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.570
Hey Keaton, check this out.

19:24.610 --> 19:28.230
Merriman was retired from
the CIA but not intelligence.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.320
He was working for some
private intel company

19:30.360 --> 19:32.230
called IVS Analytics.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.150
Merriman was investigating Tal,

19:35.190 --> 19:36.736
Tal found out about it
and had him killed.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.320
That must mean Merriman
was close.

19:38.370 --> 19:39.800
Keep looking.

19:42.110 --> 19:43.566
Hey Daniel, it's Kate.
Wh... where are you?

19:43.590 --> 19:45.370
I'm driving back
to the office now, why?

19:45.420 --> 19:46.850
You were right.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.356
The conductor was talking
to a third person

19:48.380 --> 19:50.290
just before the train departed.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.950
I'm gonna pull a screenshot now
and send it to you and Keaton.

20:08.660 --> 20:11.970
Kate ID'd the third Tal
operative in the Merriman hit.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.710
She's sending the pic over now.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.360
Keaton.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.740
Shots fired on the second floor.

20:28.770 --> 20:29.940
I need backup now.

20:29.980 --> 20:30.940
Keaton, you hit?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.200
No, I'm good.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.770
All right, I'm going after him.

20:34.810 --> 20:36.510
Hey, hey.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.560
Stay here.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.850
This way! On the escape!

21:07.890 --> 21:09.630
I see him!

21:09.680 --> 21:10.680
Freeze!

21:11.760 --> 21:12.810
Drop your weapon!

21:12.850 --> 21:13.980
FBI, don't move!

21:19.640 --> 21:21.250
Subject down.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.070
Hannah.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.170
I had fun at dinner last night.

22:08.210 --> 22:09.470
No, you didn't.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.780
All right, no, I didn't.

22:10.820 --> 22:12.130
But thanks for coming anyway.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.480
It's for your job.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.830
I'm happy to do it.

22:14.870 --> 22:16.570
Besides, I know
you'll make it up to me.

22:16.610 --> 22:18.740
- Oh yeah? With what?
- I'll think of something.

22:18.790 --> 22:20.490
- What time is your flight?
- 9:00.

22:20.530 --> 22:22.400
Oh, God, I better get going.

22:26.490 --> 22:27.970
This is a big day for you.

22:28.010 --> 22:30.580
Yeah, one of my assets
might have a source

22:30.630 --> 22:31.980
inside the Rouhani regime,

22:32.020 --> 22:33.980
and I need to be there
to see what's real.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.200
Plus it took me a month
to talk Shepherd

22:36.240 --> 22:37.630
into approving this op.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.160
Shepherd's overseeing this one?

22:39.200 --> 22:41.290
Yeah, she oversees everything.

22:41.330 --> 22:42.640
And where you going again?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.420
You know I can't tell you.

22:44.470 --> 22:46.870
By the way, those shoes aren't
gonna put themselves up today.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.576
You know what?
I'm going to put them away...

22:48.600 --> 22:49.950
Tomorrow.

22:49.990 --> 22:51.430
Yes, you say that
every single day.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.870
And every day I mean it.

22:52.910 --> 22:55.350
Besides, it'll give you
something to remember me by.

22:55.390 --> 22:56.960
Oh?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.130
All right, well, it's not
exactly what I had in mind,

22:59.180 --> 23:00.530
but I'll take it.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.270
I'll see you in three days.

23:04.310 --> 23:05.570
I love you.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.310
I love you too.

23:10.670 --> 23:14.320
Reduced sentences,
visitation benefits,

23:14.370 --> 23:17.500
immunity from certain charges.

23:17.540 --> 23:18.850
We want to help you, Viktor,

23:18.890 --> 23:22.070
but you've got to give us
something in return.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.680
Visitation.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.340
Yeah.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.600
Yeah, why? Is there someone
you want to see?

23:34.650 --> 23:36.390
Who do you wanna see, Viktor?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.570
Just tell me. I can help you
get back to them.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.700
Two people were shot in
cold blood yesterday morning.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.180
We believe that these men
are responsible for it, Anna.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.230
I need to find them
and I need to find them

23:53.270 --> 23:54.840
before they do this again.

23:54.880 --> 23:55.930
So.

23:57.410 --> 23:59.800
This man look familiar to you?

23:59.850 --> 24:01.110
No.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.680
What about him?
You recognize him?

24:05.590 --> 24:07.810
I don't think...

24:07.850 --> 24:08.590
No.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.940
No? What about him?

24:12.030 --> 24:13.600
No.

24:14.900 --> 24:16.510
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.910
No, no. You... you are helping,
it's, uh...

24:19.950 --> 24:21.910
Hey, Daniel.

24:22.780 --> 24:24.440
Where are you with Nemec?

24:24.480 --> 24:25.920
- Closer.
- He give you anything?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.090
Not yet but he will, trust me.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.230
This is Keaton.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.450
Okay. I'll be right down.

24:39.540 --> 24:42.150
Miss, step in
the metal detector.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.280
Walk through this way.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.070
- Hannah?
- Hi.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.510
I'm Will Keaton.
Pleasure to meet you.

24:56.550 --> 24:58.860
So you're going to have
15 minutes with her.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.250
That's it

25:00.300 --> 25:02.470
and no physical contact
of any kind is allowed.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.780
Understand?
Yeah.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.220
If at any time you feel unsafe,

25:06.260 --> 25:07.910
all you have to do is
just ask to leave.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.846
I'll be right in there
immediately and get you out.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.920
Does that mean
you'll be listening?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.570
I have to.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.310
Okay?
Yeah.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.400
All right, this way, please.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.050
Hi, Mom.

25:53.090 --> 25:54.610
Hi.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.530
Do you want to sit?

25:59.570 --> 26:01.530
- Am I allowed to?
- Yes, of course.

26:16.590 --> 26:18.900
You're so big.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.836
You're so beautiful.
That... that's what I meant.

26:20.860 --> 26:24.160
You're so beautiful.

26:27.510 --> 26:29.470
You're so different.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.650
Well...

26:31.690 --> 26:33.780
I miss you.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.310
I miss you every day.

26:39.740 --> 26:42.660
Well, what's it like in prison?

26:45.620 --> 26:47.140
Do you remember that time

26:47.190 --> 26:49.150
we went camping at
the Virginia Lakes?

26:49.190 --> 26:50.450
Yeah.

26:50.490 --> 26:51.970
It was so hot during the day,

26:52.020 --> 26:53.736
and then at night
we would freeze our tails off.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.086
We had to sleep in the car
to stay warm.

26:55.110 --> 26:57.200
Yeah, that's right.
I forgot about that.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.590
That's what it was like.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.900
Sometimes, Hannah,
it was so cold

27:03.940 --> 27:05.990
that they would...

27:06.030 --> 27:08.250
slip you an extra pair of socks.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.990
You know, for your feet
or your hands,

27:10.040 --> 27:14.390
but all I wanted
in the world was a hat.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.520
It's amazing how much
you miss the little things.

27:25.790 --> 27:28.140
Why were you at my school
two days ago?

27:28.180 --> 27:31.490
- To see you.
- The news said you escaped.

27:31.540 --> 27:33.020
Did you get in trouble?

27:33.060 --> 27:36.190
Yes. I got my wrists slapped
a little bit, yes.

27:38.930 --> 27:41.460
Are you back home?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.760
Uh, no.
Not exactly.

27:42.810 --> 27:44.290
I meant in Washington.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.720
Yes.

27:45.770 --> 27:48.330
- For good?
- For now.

27:49.070 --> 27:52.730
Dad said he thinks you're
cooperating with the FBI.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.650
What's high school like?

27:57.690 --> 28:00.260
I can't believe
I have a sophomore.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.130
It's okay,
better than being a freshman.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.310
I bet.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.220
And I get my license soon.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.440
Your driver's license?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.570
- Mm-hmm.
- Hannah...

28:09.620 --> 28:11.310
I don't know
how I feel about that.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.320
Uh, Dad lets me drive
all the time.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.670
What?

28:14.710 --> 28:17.410
Well, I have my permit, Mom.
I'm 15.

28:21.630 --> 28:24.240
I know how old you are.

28:25.110 --> 28:29.770
So are you cooperating
or... or whatever it's called.

28:29.810 --> 28:31.680
I don't want to talk about that.

28:31.730 --> 28:32.900
But why not?

28:32.940 --> 28:34.290
Because I want to listen to you.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.640
I want to hear everything
about you.

28:40.870 --> 28:45.000
I was told that you
and your dad moved, so...

28:45.910 --> 28:47.700
You like your new house?

28:49.700 --> 28:52.010
Hannah, please talk to me.
We don't have a lot of time.

28:52.050 --> 28:55.180
Why did you do it?

28:56.710 --> 28:59.490
I need to know, Mom.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.190
Mom, tell me.

29:02.230 --> 29:04.370
I can't.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.410
We didn't want to move.

29:06.460 --> 29:08.370
We had to.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.460
Well, that must've been
very hard.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.850
I'm very sorry for you.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.590
But you won't tell me why.

29:19.430 --> 29:20.600
I want to leave.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.040
Hannah.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.820
- I want to leave now.
- No, Hannah. Hannah!

29:24.870 --> 29:27.260
Hannah, wait!

29:58.900 --> 30:00.290
Hey, Will.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.600
You were looking for me?

30:01.640 --> 30:03.820
Yeah, yeah.
I think we got something.

30:04.780 --> 30:06.496
So we've been going over
the Merriman files

30:06.520 --> 30:08.650
and I think we identified
the codename he's been using

30:08.690 --> 30:10.090
for his Tal investigation.

30:10.130 --> 30:12.040
- Black Bear.
- That mean anything to you?

30:12.090 --> 30:15.130
Merriman had a habit
of assigning codenames

30:15.180 --> 30:17.310
but he didn't give these names
to investigations;

30:17.350 --> 30:20.360
he gave them to sources,
targets, and assets.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.360
Black Bear isn't a case file,

30:22.400 --> 30:24.060
it's a person
with the initials B.B.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.540
Well, whoever it is could
have Merriman's intelligence.

30:26.580 --> 30:28.630
Which means we have to find
them before Tal does.

30:28.670 --> 30:31.150
Kate, give me the employee
directory to IVS Analytics.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.590
Mm-hmm.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.980
I think it's someone
that Merriman worked with.

30:47.730 --> 30:49.470
I ran a search.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.780
There's only one employee
at IVS with the initials B.B.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.480
Her name is Beverly Brooks.

30:55.910 --> 30:57.350
- Beverly Brooks?
- Yes.

30:57.390 --> 30:58.960
I'm Agent Daniel Zain

30:59.000 --> 31:00.920
with the FBI's
Counterintelligence Division.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.506
Agents and I on our way
to speak with you

31:02.530 --> 31:03.880
regarding Dean Merriman.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.400
I need you to stay
where you are.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.680
Can I help you?

31:42.130 --> 31:44.090
Yeah. Any idea where?

31:44.140 --> 31:45.350
Copy.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.140
Hey, I just got a report
of shots fired.

32:14.950 --> 32:15.990
Everybody down!

32:23.170 --> 32:24.700
FBI, go!

32:24.740 --> 32:26.636
- Hey, where did they go?
- They're in the basement!

32:26.660 --> 32:29.090
Let's go! Move, move!

32:39.320 --> 32:41.110
Go.

33:06.130 --> 33:08.050
FBI, freeze!

33:30.680 --> 33:31.980
- Beverly Brooks?
- Uh-huh.

33:32.030 --> 33:33.550
I'm Agent Will Keaton
with the FBI.

33:33.590 --> 33:34.746
I need to get you out of here.

33:34.770 --> 33:36.290
- I'm not leaving.
- What?

33:36.330 --> 33:37.690
I can't.
Dean told me to do this.

33:42.990 --> 33:44.406
- We got to go.
- You don't understand!

33:44.430 --> 33:46.520
I'm trying to download
Dean's files.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.040
Files? What files?

33:48.090 --> 33:50.090
This is what you want.
It's his case file on Tal.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.000
Go, we got to go.
Go! Come on, come on!

35:05.680 --> 35:07.860
I can't tell you anything
about Tal.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.690
Dean didn't share his work
with me.

35:10.730 --> 35:12.300
He didn't share it with anyone.

35:12.340 --> 35:15.910
So did he have any backups
of his work?

35:15.960 --> 35:17.650
Any hard copies? Anything?

35:17.700 --> 35:19.090
No.

35:19.130 --> 35:20.846
Dean was so protective
that he stored it all

35:20.870 --> 35:22.830
on the secure server at IVS.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.140
Every piece of evidence,
every document, every lead.

35:26.180 --> 35:28.490
It was all there.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.670
Okay.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.720
There was one thing.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.266
Dean asked me to research
something for him

35:42.290 --> 35:43.850
a few weeks ago.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.176
He didn't say
it was connected to Tal

35:45.200 --> 35:46.680
but I know it was.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.600
It was a name, Sierra Maestra.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.600
- What is that?
- A mountain range in Cuba.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.690
Dean had me find everything
I could about it.

35:54.730 --> 35:58.820
Topography, surrounding towns,
local infrastructure.

35:58.870 --> 36:00.610
I think whatever
Dean was killed over

36:00.650 --> 36:02.090
had something to do with Cuba.

36:06.350 --> 36:08.230
Nothing.

36:08.270 --> 36:10.050
You sure?

36:10.100 --> 36:11.660
No, I don't know of a connection

36:11.710 --> 36:13.190
between Tal and Sierra Maestra

36:13.230 --> 36:15.670
or Cuba at all, for that matter.

36:15.710 --> 36:16.970
Well, if that's true

36:17.020 --> 36:18.800
then we've got nothing
from Merriman.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.800
What about Nemec?

36:19.850 --> 36:21.720
Daniel's close.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.240
I think we're gonna
get him to turn.

36:26.940 --> 36:30.860
Well, I didn't say
it before, but...

36:30.900 --> 36:32.680
thank you for Hannah.

36:35.170 --> 36:37.210
Sorry it didn't turn out
the way you hoped.

36:39.130 --> 36:42.350
I got to be
in the same room with her.

36:42.390 --> 36:45.610
Three years ago,
that was a dream.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.620
You were wrong.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.840
When you said it's not our job
to care about the victims,

36:54.880 --> 36:57.620
their families...

36:57.670 --> 36:59.800
it actually is our job to care,

36:59.840 --> 37:02.240
to find justice for them.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.800
You and the CIA,

37:03.850 --> 37:05.306
I mean you guys may have
different priorities,

37:05.330 --> 37:08.240
but this isn't the CIA.

37:10.850 --> 37:12.640
And I'm definitely not you.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.836
Two nights ago,
you looked me in the eye

37:17.860 --> 37:20.730
and you said
you didn't spy for Tal.

37:20.780 --> 37:25.080
You said you gave up the names
of those four CIA operatives

37:26.960 --> 37:29.220
because you made a choice
to protect your daughter.

37:34.220 --> 37:37.710
Why should I ever trust
anything you have to say?

37:40.450 --> 37:41.970
You shouldn't.

37:43.410 --> 37:45.800
You shouldn't trust me,
Agent Keaton.

37:47.410 --> 37:49.670
You shouldn't trust anyone.

37:51.110 --> 37:53.290
Not when it comes
to Mikhail Tal.

38:39.380 --> 38:42.030
What are you doing here?

38:42.070 --> 38:43.820
No one's watching.

38:43.860 --> 38:45.340
I made sure.

38:45.380 --> 38:47.860
Have you been in contact
with Tal?

38:47.910 --> 38:49.080
Yes.

38:51.040 --> 38:54.220
So what's his plan?

38:54.260 --> 38:56.440
To do nothing for now.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.260
Nothing?

38:58.310 --> 39:00.010
Am I just supposed to rot
in here?!

39:00.050 --> 39:01.440
Quiet.

39:05.530 --> 39:07.450
Did you say anything
to the interrogator?

39:07.490 --> 39:09.800
No.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.240
Are you sure?

39:12.280 --> 39:14.150
I didn't say a word.

39:15.540 --> 39:17.110
Good.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.080
Have faith, Viktor.

39:31.950 --> 39:33.910
Everything will work out
as it should.
