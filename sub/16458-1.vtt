00:13.046 --> 00:16.117
<i>January 23, 1984.</i>

00:16.119 --> 00:18.690
<i>It was a day that
changed my life forever.</i>

00:18.691 --> 00:21.262
<i>...The muscle,
the moral courage that built</i>

00:21.263 --> 00:24.168
the greatest, freest nation
the world has ever known.

00:24.169 --> 00:25.905
<i>Ronald Reagan
was our President</i>

00:25.906 --> 00:27.942
<i>and there was trouble
brewing in Iran.</i>

00:27.943 --> 00:29.679
<i>I was just a kid,</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:31.717
<i>but I knew
who was behind it.</i>

00:31.718 --> 00:33.688
<i>His name was
The Iron Sheik.</i>

00:33.689 --> 00:36.326
<i>From Tehran, Iran,</i>

00:36.327 --> 00:39.600
<i>weighing 258 lbs,</i>

00:39.601 --> 00:42.473
<i>The Iron Sheik!</i>

00:42.474 --> 00:44.977
<i>They have a lot of
hate in their hearts for this man.</i>

00:44.978 --> 00:49.888
Iran-- number one!
U.S.A.--

00:49.889 --> 00:52.661
<i>You see, Reagan
may have freed the hostages</i>

00:52.662 --> 00:55.900
<i>but The Sheik still had
the championship belt.</i>

00:55.901 --> 00:57.838
<i>There was only one man</i>

00:57.839 --> 00:59.842
<i>that could save us.</i>

00:59.843 --> 01:02.982
<i># I am a real
American... #</i>

01:02.983 --> 01:06.389
<i>From Venice
Beach, California,</i>

01:06.390 --> 01:11.500
<i>the incredible
Hulk Hogan!</i>

01:11.501 --> 01:14.005
<i>And the
Hulkster rips off that shirt.</i>

01:14.006 --> 01:16.476
<i>But three
minutes into the match</i>

01:16.477 --> 01:19.417
<i>Hulk Hogan was locked in
the dreaded camel clutch.</i>

01:19.418 --> 01:21.086
<i>It's over for the Hulk.</i>

01:21.087 --> 01:23.324
<i>This move would snap
the back of a normal man,</i>

01:23.325 --> 01:25.429
<i>But this wasn't
a normal man.</i>

01:25.430 --> 01:27.032
<i>This was Hulk Hogan</i>

01:27.033 --> 01:29.671
<i>and he was fighting
for our country.</i>

01:29.672 --> 01:32.410
<i>The Hulkster got out
of the camel clutch</i>

01:32.411 --> 01:34.281
<i>with the Sheik
on his back,</i>

01:34.282 --> 01:36.151
<i>dropped the big leg</i>

01:36.152 --> 01:38.155
<i>and he pinned
the Sheik.</i>

01:38.156 --> 01:40.661
<i>Hulkamania was born
and the message was clear--</i>

01:40.662 --> 01:42.665
<i>You don't mess
with Hulk Hogan</i>

01:42.666 --> 01:44.502
<i>and you certainly
don't mess with America.</i>

01:49.513 --> 01:50.949
I must break you.

01:50.950 --> 01:53.120
<i>Look what
happened to Ivan Drago.</i>

01:53.121 --> 01:54.556
<i>He tried to mess
with America</i>

01:54.557 --> 01:56.560
<i>and Rocky
kicked his ass.</i>

01:56.561 --> 01:58.865
<i>And then when the Vietnamese
were holding P.O.W.S</i>

01:58.866 --> 02:01.403
<i>Rambo went in and
he kicked their ass.</i>

02:01.404 --> 02:03.407
And in the spirit
of Rambo

02:03.408 --> 02:06.815
<i>let me tell you we're
gonna win this time.</i>

02:06.816 --> 02:08.818
<i>Then came
Arnold Schwarzenegger,</i>

02:08.820 --> 02:10.556
<i>The ultimate
ass-kicker.</i>

02:10.556 --> 02:13.495
<i>I never saw "Gone With
the Wind" or "Casablanca,"</i>

02:13.496 --> 02:16.568
<i>but I can tell you every
line of every Arnold movie.</i>

02:16.569 --> 02:19.574
<i>"Crush your enemies, see
them driven before you</i>

02:19.575 --> 02:22.079
<i>and hear the lamentations
of the women."</i>

02:22.080 --> 02:24.785
<i>"Dylan,
you son of a bitch."</i>

02:24.786 --> 02:27.791
<i>And they go bam! And they're all oiled
up and their veins are popping out.</i>

02:27.792 --> 02:30.130
<i>I have the power!</i>

02:30.131 --> 02:32.969
<i>Better, Stronger, Faster.</i>

02:32.970 --> 02:34.472
<i>I was just 12 years old</i>

02:34.473 --> 02:37.177
<i>and there was an explosion
of ass-kicking in America.</i>

02:37.178 --> 02:39.014
<i>And like
our Olympic athletes</i>

02:39.015 --> 02:40.785
<i>we set our sights
on the stars</i>

02:40.786 --> 02:42.455
and we're going
for the gold.

02:42.456 --> 02:44.994
<i># the eye of the tiger. #</i>

02:47.434 --> 02:49.437
<i>I wanted to
tear off my shirt</i>

02:49.438 --> 02:52.476
<i>and be ripped, tanned
and larger than life.</i>

02:52.477 --> 02:53.913
<i>But in reality</i>

02:53.914 --> 02:56.685
<i>I was a fat, pale kid
from Poughkeepsie.</i>

02:56.686 --> 02:58.288
<i>You see, I come from
an overweight family.</i>

02:58.289 --> 03:01.094
<i>My parents were always a
little on the heavy side.</i>

03:01.095 --> 03:03.098
<i>I couldn't ask
for a better mom.</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:04.768
<i>She did everything
for her three boys.</i>

03:04.769 --> 03:06.505
<i>We went to church
three times a week</i>

03:06.506 --> 03:08.543
<i>and she even taught
Sunday school.</i>

03:08.544 --> 03:10.814
<i>My dad was always
there for us too</i>

03:10.815 --> 03:14.087
<i>and he even coached
our little league teams.</i>

03:14.088 --> 03:17.194
<i>I love my dad, but he
was never really my hero.</i>

03:17.195 --> 03:19.232
<i>I didn't want
to be like him.</i>

03:19.233 --> 03:20.802
<i>I wanted to be
like Arnold.</i>

03:20.803 --> 03:24.242
<i>Problem is, I was always
too small, too short.</i>

03:24.243 --> 03:27.014
<i>People would say, "Hey, Little Bell.
What's up, Little Bell?"</i>

03:27.015 --> 03:29.018
<i>And I didn't want
to be Little Bell.</i>

03:29.019 --> 03:31.023
<i>I wanted to be
Big Bell.</i>

03:31.024 --> 03:33.561
<i>My older brother Mike
was a little chubby</i>

03:33.562 --> 03:35.800
<i>and every morning
when he went to school</i>

03:35.801 --> 03:38.405
<i>he'd get on the bus and the
kids would call him Pugsley.</i>

03:38.406 --> 03:40.276
<i>He didn't like that
too much,</i>

03:40.277 --> 03:42.280
<i>so he beat
some of those kids up.</i>

03:42.281 --> 03:45.753
<i>That's where he got
the nickname "Mad Dog."</i>

03:45.754 --> 03:47.825
<i>Mark was
the baby of the family.</i>

03:47.826 --> 03:49.862
<i>He had a hard time
in school.</i>

03:49.863 --> 03:51.366
<i>He was separated
from his friends</i>

03:51.367 --> 03:53.370
<i>and put in the class
with the special kids.</i>

03:53.371 --> 03:56.075
<i>It didn't make him feel
very special at all.</i>

03:56.076 --> 03:57.711
<i>He hated school,</i>

03:57.712 --> 04:00.384
<i>So he spent all of his
time playing sports.</i>

04:00.385 --> 04:02.689
<i>He'd come to the dinner
table dripping with sweat.</i>

04:02.690 --> 04:06.062
<i>Mad Dog and I
nicknamed him "Smelly."</i>

04:06.063 --> 04:09.069
<i>So I was the short kid,
Mad Dog was the fat kid</i>

04:09.070 --> 04:11.073
<i>And Smelly had
a learning disability.</i>

04:11.074 --> 04:13.679
<i>Okay, I get it.
We're never gonna make it, right?</i>

04:13.680 --> 04:16.851
<i>But for us, we knew
muscles were the answer</i>

04:16.851 --> 04:19.223
<i>and the Hulkster
showed us the way.</i>

04:19.224 --> 04:21.261
Train, say your prayers,
eat your vitamins.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.699
Be true to yourself,
true to your country.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.171
Be a real American.

04:26.172 --> 04:29.378
<i>So we started
training in the basement.</i>

04:29.379 --> 04:30.780
<i>We'd body-slam
each other,</i>

04:30.781 --> 04:32.784
<i>drop elbows, D.D.T.S</i>

04:32.785 --> 04:35.657
<i>Double noggin knocker,
the abdominal stretch,</i>

04:35.658 --> 04:38.329
<i>the iron claw,
the Boston crab</i>

04:38.330 --> 04:39.531
<i>the piledriver.</i>

04:39.532 --> 04:42.070
<i>And when Mad Dog
was too tough for me</i>

04:42.071 --> 04:43.574
<i>I would break out
the steel chair.</i>

04:45.312 --> 04:47.482
<i>My mom's brother John
was a bodybuilder</i>

04:47.483 --> 04:49.920
<i>and he gave me and my brothers
our first muscle magazines</i>

04:49.921 --> 04:52.025
<i>and showed us
how to work out.</i>

04:52.026 --> 04:54.195
<i>And the next Christmas
instead of video games</i>

04:54.196 --> 04:56.367
<i>we got the Hulkamania
workout set.</i>

04:56.368 --> 04:59.940
<i>Are you ready to feel the power?</i>

04:59.941 --> 05:02.513
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are

05:02.514 --> 05:05.252
the power team!

05:05.253 --> 05:07.424
<i>Mad Dog became the
captain of the football team</i>

05:07.425 --> 05:10.797
and Smelly and I both started
competing in power lifting.

05:10.798 --> 05:14.504
<i>Chris Bell is next at 425.</i>

05:14.505 --> 05:17.745
<i>Soon I was the
strongest kid in my high school.</i>

05:17.746 --> 05:19.749
<i>Then I broke
the New York State record.</i>

05:19.750 --> 05:22.187
<i>And that's when I first got
accused of using steroids.</i>

05:30.873 --> 05:33.143
<i>I knew guys who used
them, but they were losers.</i>

05:33.144 --> 05:36.183
<i>If my heroes didn't need
steroids then neither did I.</i>

05:36.184 --> 05:38.187
<i>By the time
I was a senior</i>

05:38.188 --> 05:40.358
<i>I was one of the strongest
kids in the country.</i>

05:40.359 --> 05:42.262
<i>Hulk Hogan was always
talking about</i>

05:42.263 --> 05:45.201
<i>"hanging and banging down at
Gold's Gym, Venice Beach, brother."</i>

05:45.202 --> 05:47.340
<i>I thought, "that's
where Arnold trains.</i>

05:47.341 --> 05:49.144
<i>that's where
I need to be."</i>

05:49.145 --> 05:51.148
<i>I was gonna be
an American hero</i>

05:51.149 --> 05:53.152
<i>And I was willing to do
whatever it takes.</i>

06:42.555 --> 06:44.926
<i>It's been 15 years
since I got to California</i>

06:44.927 --> 06:47.464
<i>and now
I'm 33 years old.</i>

06:47.465 --> 06:50.003
<i>When Arnold was 33
he'd already won</i>

06:50.004 --> 06:52.241
<i>the Mr. Olympia
seven times.</i>

06:52.242 --> 06:54.980
<i>Stallone had already made
"Rocky I and Rocky II."</i>

06:54.981 --> 06:56.984
<i>And the Hulkster
had already been</i>

06:56.985 --> 06:59.790
<i>the heavyweight champion
four years in a row.</i>

06:59.791 --> 07:02.863
<i>I really thought muscles
were gonna be the answer.</i>

07:02.864 --> 07:06.604
<i>But all they got me was a
job selling gym memberships.</i>

07:06.605 --> 07:08.808
<i>I still train
every day at Gold's,</i>

07:08.809 --> 07:12.249
<i>But the only thing left of Arnold
is a cheap mural on the wall</i>

07:12.250 --> 07:14.721
<i>and a bunch of guys telling
stories about the old days,</i>

07:14.722 --> 07:16.224
<i>like my buddy Paul.</i>

07:16.225 --> 07:18.462
It's changed a lot in
all these years, you know.

07:18.463 --> 07:19.999
How long
have you been here?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.468
Since 1980.

07:21.469 --> 07:23.707
Of course, Arnold was
on the scene and Arnold--

07:23.708 --> 07:26.345
Nobody had ever seen anybody
who looked like Arnold.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.850
Sylvester Stallone had
just done the "Rocky" movies

07:28.851 --> 07:30.888
and he was the type of
guy that I could relate to.

07:30.889 --> 07:33.660
<i>Paul even got a chance to
work with Sly in "Over the Top."</i>

07:33.661 --> 07:35.564
I should be able to
blow them away real easy.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.610
<i>I couldn't believe
the dream was coming true.</i>

07:41.611 --> 07:43.281
<i>And did you get a chance
to do it again?</i>

07:43.282 --> 07:45.920
No, but I'm hoping
to get back in shape

07:45.921 --> 07:47.890
to be able to make that
a reality.

07:47.891 --> 07:49.928
You can be
on the street one day

07:49.929 --> 07:52.098
and you can be in the
penthouse the next.

07:52.099 --> 07:53.368
Anything's possible.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.178
This is
my humble abode.

07:58.179 --> 07:59.949
- Your humble abode right here?
- Yeah.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.220
So do you actually
live in the van?

08:02.221 --> 08:03.957
I actually live--
well, I sleep in it,

08:03.958 --> 08:05.393
let's put it
this way, yes.

08:05.394 --> 08:07.731
You sleep in it. And
then you train over here.

08:07.732 --> 08:10.337
I train here, yeah.

08:10.338 --> 08:11.907
<i>You would see
vans like this--</i>

08:11.908 --> 08:13.878
<i>Guys would come from
all over the world,</i>

08:13.879 --> 08:15.882
<i>sleep in their cars,
this and that--</i>

08:15.883 --> 08:18.086
<i>Anything to get a chance
to train at Gold's Gym</i>

08:18.087 --> 08:21.025
because we had
something special here.

08:21.026 --> 08:22.562
<i>What would you say
to people that say,</i>

08:22.563 --> 08:26.003
<i>"the dream's over, man.
You're 50 years old."</i>

08:26.004 --> 08:27.740
<i>What would you say
to those people?</i>

08:27.741 --> 08:30.879
They're the ones
that are short-sighted.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.919
Now in six months I
could still be in the van,

08:33.919 --> 08:35.856
but if I can
outlift everybody,

08:35.857 --> 08:38.863
I can outsquat them, outbench
them, out-dead-lift them,

08:38.864 --> 08:40.866
Who's the king?

08:40.868 --> 08:42.403
<i>Guys like you and me</i>

08:42.404 --> 08:45.042
Can fulfill our dreams.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.712
We can train.

08:46.713 --> 08:49.851
Game ain't over.
The sun is shining.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.894
And it ain't over.

08:53.895 --> 08:56.065
<i>Is that gonna
be me in 20 years?</i>

08:56.066 --> 08:58.237
<i>I did everything
my heroes said--</i>

08:58.238 --> 09:00.374
<i>I trained,
I said my prayers,</i>

09:00.375 --> 09:02.612
<i>I had my vitamins.
Where did I go wrong?</i>

09:08.124 --> 09:10.862
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

09:10.863 --> 09:13.234
How are you?

09:13.235 --> 09:16.007
I always make the cookie bars
'cause cookie bars are important.

09:16.008 --> 09:17.576
What teams did you
make these for?

09:17.577 --> 09:19.313
I made them for Arlington
football teams

09:19.314 --> 09:21.217
first time ever
they won a ball game.

09:21.218 --> 09:23.489
They used to call them
"Rosie's cookie bars"

09:23.490 --> 09:26.094
and they really believe that
they help them win all the games.

09:26.095 --> 09:28.399
Wouldn't that be like
performance enhancement?

09:28.400 --> 09:31.538
It's not an enhancement.
It's a little bit of sugar,

09:31.539 --> 09:33.810
which can get you going,
carbs.

09:33.811 --> 09:35.614
But it's all natural
ingredients.

09:35.615 --> 09:38.887
There's no steroids
in here.

09:38.888 --> 09:42.394
Eating your mom's cooking is sort
of comforting, don't you think?

09:42.395 --> 09:43.798
Sure.

09:43.799 --> 09:45.501
Things change,

09:45.502 --> 09:48.507
but the cookie bars remain,
that's for sure.

09:48.508 --> 09:50.411
<i>My mom likes to think</i>

09:50.412 --> 09:52.482
<i>that the world is as pure
as her cookie bars.</i>

09:52.483 --> 09:54.486
<i>But life isn't always
like that.</i>

09:54.487 --> 09:57.258
<i>And a lot of things we grew up
believing ended up not being true.</i>

09:57.259 --> 10:00.599
<i>First I found out there's
no such thing as Santa Claus</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.670
<i>or the easter bunny.
That kind of sucks.</i>

10:02.671 --> 10:04.474
<i>Then I saw
this news report.</i>

10:04.475 --> 10:06.778
<i>The Iron Sheik
had been arrested recently</i>

10:06.779 --> 10:08.783
<i>along with wrestler
Hacksaw Jim Duggan</i>

10:08.784 --> 10:11.087
<i>while driving along
the Garden State Parkway.</i>

10:11.088 --> 10:14.528
<i>The Iron Sheik was charged with
possession of cocaine and marijuana.</i>

10:14.529 --> 10:17.134
<i>What has interested most
wrestling fans in this case</i>

10:17.135 --> 10:20.140
<i>is that the Iron Sheik and Hacksaw
are known to be adversaries.</i>

10:20.141 --> 10:22.144
<i>So why were they
traveling together?</i>

10:22.145 --> 10:24.582
<i>Yeah, I thought
these guys hated each other.</i>

10:24.583 --> 10:27.455
<i>Wham! Right on
the back of the Iron Sheik!</i>

10:27.456 --> 10:29.826
<i>Was their feud all made up?</i>

10:29.827 --> 10:31.663
<i>Was wrestling fake?</i>

10:31.664 --> 10:34.102
<i>Who's left
to believe in anymore?</i>

10:34.103 --> 10:36.340
<i>Well, at least
I still had my heroes.</i>

10:36.341 --> 10:38.277
<i>Those guys would never
let me down.</i>

10:38.278 --> 10:40.849
<i># I need a hero... #</i>

10:40.850 --> 10:43.221
<i>Today Hogan
admits the famous physique</i>

10:43.222 --> 10:45.359
<i>was the result
of 12 years of steroids.</i>

10:45.360 --> 10:49.501
<i>Truth is, all my heroes
had a dirty little secret.</i>

10:49.502 --> 10:51.972
Hollywood actor Sylvester
Stallone has been charged

10:51.973 --> 10:53.976
with importing
bodybuilding drugs

10:53.977 --> 10:55.948
when he visited Australia
last month.

10:55.949 --> 10:57.852
<i>Did you take steroids?
- I take them.</i>

10:57.853 --> 11:00.256
I took them, yeah,
up until the competition.

11:00.257 --> 11:02.260
<i>I was always
against steroids</i>

11:02.261 --> 11:04.532
<i>and when I found out that
all my heroes used them</i>

11:04.533 --> 11:07.204
<i>I'd like to say it didn't
bother me, but it really did.</i>

11:07.205 --> 11:09.175
<i>I can't imagine
how my mom would feel</i>

11:09.176 --> 11:11.179
<i>if she found out
that both of my brothers</i>

11:11.180 --> 11:13.718
<i>are on steroids
right now.</i>

11:13.719 --> 11:16.256
<i>My older brother
started using steroids</i>

11:16.257 --> 11:18.261
<i>when he went to play
Division I football</i>

11:18.262 --> 11:19.997
<i>at the University
of Cincinnati.</i>

11:19.998 --> 11:22.369
When I got to Cincinnati the
practices were so grueling,

11:22.370 --> 11:24.573
much more than
what I expected.

11:24.574 --> 11:27.245
<i>Coaches would say, "you gotta
get bigger, stronger, faster."</i>

11:27.246 --> 11:28.682
<i>Was it intimidating?
- Oh, man,</i>

11:28.683 --> 11:30.753
A lot different than I
thought it was gonna be.

11:30.754 --> 11:33.759
<i>He called me from Cincinnati
and asked me for money for steroids.</i>

11:33.760 --> 11:36.298
<i>I said, "what do you need that for?"
he says, "I can't compete here."</i>

11:36.299 --> 11:39.237
So I'm like, "I don't know what
that is. It sounds like drugs."

11:39.238 --> 11:42.043
He goes, "it is drugs." I said, "I'm
not gonna send you money for drugs.

11:42.044 --> 11:44.047
If you want drugs
go get a job."

11:44.048 --> 11:46.853
I remember at one point I
think you maybe came home

11:46.854 --> 11:48.858
for a break
or you did something

11:48.859 --> 11:51.429
and you told me, "hey,
come here, help me out."

11:51.430 --> 11:54.636
And you pulled down your pants and you're
like, "you have to inject this in me."

11:54.637 --> 11:56.974
<i>And I hated it 'cause I was
totally against steroids.</i>

11:56.975 --> 11:59.846
And you were like, "come on,
just do it. You have to do it."

11:59.847 --> 12:02.686
You gotta help your big brother out,
man. So it was no decision at all.

12:02.687 --> 12:06.427
Everybody else that was
doing well was on 'em.

12:06.428 --> 12:08.498
<i>Shortly after
getting on the juice</i>

12:08.499 --> 12:10.803
<i>Mad Dog quit college to
pursue an even bigger dream.</i>

12:10.804 --> 12:12.873
<i>Oh, look at that now!</i>

12:12.874 --> 12:14.410
<i>Here we go!
Mike Bell!</i>

12:14.411 --> 12:15.947
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

12:15.948 --> 12:17.918
<i>That was my big brother
wrestling on T.V.</i>

12:17.919 --> 12:19.988
<i>Right
hand by Bell. Oh, man!</i>

12:19.989 --> 12:21.992
<i>Mad Dog wanted
to be a superstar,</i>

12:21.993 --> 12:23.996
<i>But he was what they call
a "jobber."</i>

12:23.997 --> 12:25.901
<i>That's the guy they pay
to get beat up</i>

12:25.902 --> 12:28.272
<i>to make the other guys look
good. He didn't care, though.</i>

12:28.273 --> 12:31.245
<i>He was gonna get himself a contract
and headline "Wrestlemania."</i>

12:31.246 --> 12:33.082
<i>Why did you
even come in the ring?</i>

12:33.083 --> 12:34.486
<i>You should have
gone home, dummy.</i>

12:34.487 --> 12:36.356
<i>But he never
got the contract</i>

12:36.357 --> 12:39.329
<i>And eventually
the W.W.E. stopped calling.</i>

12:39.330 --> 12:41.333
<i>Why did you think
you didn't make it?</i>

12:41.334 --> 12:44.005
<i>Probably mostly
my own fault.</i>

12:44.006 --> 12:46.176
I went from being a guy
who used steroids

12:46.177 --> 12:48.013
to a guy who used
steroids and pot.

12:48.014 --> 12:50.018
<i>And I still needed
to escape reality</i>

12:50.019 --> 12:52.723
so I started taking ecstasy,
cocaine, acid, painkillers.

12:52.724 --> 12:55.028
<i>Mike Bell is where
he does not need to be now.</i>

12:55.029 --> 12:57.032
<i>He's in the wrong corner
and he's paying the price.</i>

12:57.033 --> 12:59.036
<i>Mad Dog always told me</i>

12:59.037 --> 13:01.073
<i>that he'd rather be dead
than average.</i>

13:01.074 --> 13:02.978
<i>And when he thought
his dream was over</i>

13:02.979 --> 13:05.516
<i>he couldn't cope
with the failure.</i>

13:05.517 --> 13:07.287
<i>So I had a
bottle of liquid lead,</i>

13:07.288 --> 13:09.659
a bottle of NyQuil and four
boxes of sleeping pills.

13:09.660 --> 13:11.362
I went down
to the river

13:11.363 --> 13:13.867
<i>down by
the railroad tracks,</i>

13:13.868 --> 13:17.474
<i>parked my car,
took everything.</i>

13:17.475 --> 13:20.147
And he tried
to walk into the--

13:22.118 --> 13:25.792
He tried to walk
into the Hudson river.

13:25.793 --> 13:27.896
<i>So did you take
all the sleeping pills?</i>

13:27.897 --> 13:29.666
<i>- Everything.
- And the lead additive?</i>

13:29.667 --> 13:31.872
There's no way I should be
alive right now. There's no way.

13:31.873 --> 13:33.575
<i>It's 10 years later</i>

13:33.576 --> 13:35.412
<i>and despite everything
that happened</i>

13:35.413 --> 13:37.550
<i>Mad Dog is still trying
to get that contract,</i>

13:37.551 --> 13:39.554
<i>Trying to keep
the dream alive.</i>

13:39.555 --> 13:41.558
'Cause I've been
all over the world

13:41.559 --> 13:44.832
from Singapore to Louisville,
and it doesn't matter--

13:44.833 --> 13:47.336
You line 'em up,
I'll knock 'em down.

13:47.337 --> 13:49.040
I can see why
you never made it.

13:50.912 --> 13:53.583
<i>Mad Dog used to wrestle
in front of a television audience</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:55.587
<i>of 10 million people
every week,</i>

13:55.588 --> 13:59.629
<i>but tonight he's wrestling
at the Portuguese Men's Center</i>

13:59.630 --> 14:03.571
<i>In front of 200 people
for about 50 bucks.</i>

14:07.079 --> 14:09.784
<i>And instead of
wrestling Bret the Hitman Hart</i>

14:09.785 --> 14:11.554
<i>He's facing Midgeto</i>

14:11.555 --> 14:13.558
<i>And he's getting
his ass kicked.</i>

14:15.228 --> 14:16.764
Come on, man,
come on.

14:19.838 --> 14:22.476
<i>My baby brother Smelly
was always trying to keep up</i>

14:22.477 --> 14:24.881
<i>and despite everything
that happened to Mad Dog</i>

14:24.882 --> 14:26.885
<i>he followed in his
footsteps anyway,</i>

14:26.886 --> 14:29.858
<i>becoming a pro wrestler
and using steroids.</i>

14:29.859 --> 14:32.430
The reason I decided
to use steroids was simple.

14:32.431 --> 14:33.934
I just needed
to get bigger.

14:33.935 --> 14:35.436
That was
pretty much it.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.775
<i>But unlike when Mad
Dog started using steroids,</i>

14:37.776 --> 14:39.445
<i>Smelly had a wife
to consider.</i>

14:39.446 --> 14:41.081
<i>When you got married
did you ever think</i>

14:41.082 --> 14:43.320
<i>that your husband would be
injecting himself with something?</i>

14:43.321 --> 14:46.293
No, that didn't even enter
in my conscious thought.

14:46.294 --> 14:48.831
<i>When I first met him
he was against steroids.</i>

14:48.832 --> 14:50.200
<i>He was like,
"you don't need to do it.</i>

14:50.201 --> 14:52.406
I've never done 'em. I
just don't believe in 'em."

14:52.407 --> 14:54.343
<i>I was pretty upset about it</i>

14:54.344 --> 14:56.614
<i>Because I didn't want it to come
to that. I was kind of scared.</i>

14:56.615 --> 15:00.555
I didn't want to inject
this oil into my body.

15:00.556 --> 15:02.593
I thought
it was weird.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.597
He's not a huge guy,
you know.

15:04.598 --> 15:06.234
He's 6' if he's lucky

15:06.235 --> 15:09.607
<i>and so I knew that it was
definitely going to help</i>

15:09.608 --> 15:12.748
because that's
what it does,

15:12.749 --> 15:15.252
what steroids do--
make you bigger.

15:15.253 --> 15:18.493
She basically said,
"do what you need to do."

15:18.494 --> 15:20.497
<i>Here's Jake with the daddy.</i>

15:20.498 --> 15:22.401
<i>After their son
was born Smelly decided</i>

15:22.402 --> 15:26.009
<i>The life of a pro wrestler was
not exactly what he wanted anymore.</i>

15:26.010 --> 15:28.046
Here's my little Jake
in his swing.

15:28.047 --> 15:31.185
<i>Mark: Looking back, I don't
really know what the hell I wanted.</i>

15:31.186 --> 15:33.924
Having a contract means
that you belong to W.W.E.

15:33.925 --> 15:36.130
And you have to travel.
I was married with a kid.

15:36.131 --> 15:38.835
<i>I mean, that's really
all I need--</i>

15:38.836 --> 15:41.006
A house, a kid and a wife. I'm set.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.677
One, two, three!

15:42.678 --> 15:44.247
<i>They settled
down in the suburbs</i>

15:44.248 --> 15:46.251
<i>and Smelly even
opened up his own gym.</i>

15:46.252 --> 15:47.988
<i>Yeah, my little brother
gave up</i>

15:47.989 --> 15:50.125
<i>the wrestling dream for
a respectable family life,</i>

15:50.126 --> 15:52.296
<i>but he didn't quite
give up everything.</i>

15:56.272 --> 15:58.276
<i>Now that I'm into it</i>

15:58.277 --> 16:01.315
<i>I realize it's not really
all that bad. I love steroids.</i>

16:01.316 --> 16:04.021
I think I'll probably be
on and off of them

16:04.022 --> 16:05.725
probably forever.

16:05.726 --> 16:07.695
This is what you trained
for! This is what you do!

16:07.696 --> 16:10.267
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

16:10.268 --> 16:12.338
<i>I thought that
we had an agreement</i>

16:12.339 --> 16:13.807
that he did it
for wrestling.

16:13.808 --> 16:15.411
Now he's not
wrestling anymore

16:15.412 --> 16:17.716
so naturally I thought
he would just stop.

16:17.717 --> 16:20.020
<i>In my mind there's no excuse</i>

16:20.021 --> 16:22.359
<i>for not being as strong
as you possibly can be.</i>

16:23.562 --> 16:25.866
<i>You do what you gotta do
to win.</i>

16:27.737 --> 16:29.273
<i>Come on, Chris,
let's do this now.</i>

16:31.579 --> 16:34.684
<i>Let's give it up
for him. It's a lot of weight.</i>

16:34.685 --> 16:36.455
There it is.

16:36.456 --> 16:37.690
Come on now!

16:42.201 --> 16:45.541
<i>Smoke
show! Come on, Chris.</i>

16:48.448 --> 16:50.417
- Take it, take it.
Take it, take it.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.492
<i>Nice
try, Chris, nice try.</i>

16:54.493 --> 16:56.664
<i>If you are apprehensive</i>

16:56.665 --> 16:58.901
about taking a steroid
or you're apprehensive

16:58.902 --> 17:01.106
about trying
some new methods

17:01.107 --> 17:03.277
then maybe you're not
cut out to be a champion.

17:03.278 --> 17:06.117
<i>In first
place, Mark Bell.</i>

17:06.117 --> 17:09.089
<i>I guess I'm not
cut out to be a champion,</i>

17:09.089 --> 17:12.430
<i>because I tried steroids but
I felt so guilty I had to stop.</i>

17:12.431 --> 17:14.733
- Are you gonna win worst overall lifter?
- Yeah.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.371
<i>And now I can't even compete</i>

17:16.372 --> 17:18.275
<i>In the sport
I grew up loving.</i>

17:18.276 --> 17:21.816
<i>I mean, my baby brother
just beat me by 130 lbs.</i>

17:23.621 --> 17:26.358
<i>We all grew up
in the same house,</i>

17:26.359 --> 17:29.966
<i>so why are my brothers fine
with steroids but I'm not?</i>

17:29.967 --> 17:31.736
What would you say
the differences are

17:31.737 --> 17:34.275
- between the three kids.
- Between the three?

17:34.276 --> 17:36.580
Well, I always kind of
say it like this--

17:36.581 --> 17:39.051
you were in the middle
of two guys

17:39.052 --> 17:40.955
that were very
strapping, athletic,

17:40.956 --> 17:42.960
and you were tiny
and short in stature,

17:42.961 --> 17:46.200
so I worked extra hard to
make you feel extra special.

17:46.201 --> 17:48.070
<i>One day I took you
in your room--</i>

17:48.071 --> 17:50.809
I don't know if you remember
this conversation where I said,

17:50.810 --> 17:53.381
"Christopher, what's the
best part of an Oreo cookie?"

17:53.382 --> 17:55.319
What is the best part
of an Oreo cookie?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.623
<i>- The middle.
- The middle. That's right.</i>

17:57.624 --> 18:01.499
So even though you have two
sides of a cookie on this end,

18:01.500 --> 18:03.268
the middle part is
the most delicious.

18:03.269 --> 18:05.640
Everybody wants the middle.
They even made double stuff.

18:05.641 --> 18:08.379
<i>Yep, this is pretty
much how it was growing up.</i>

18:08.380 --> 18:10.083
<i>Mom stayed at home
with the kids</i>

18:10.084 --> 18:12.755
<i>while Dad wore a suit
and tie and went to work.</i>

18:12.756 --> 18:16.195
<i>He was at I.B.M. for 20
years until he was downsized.</i>

18:16.196 --> 18:18.700
<i>But now he has his own
business doing taxes.</i>

18:18.701 --> 18:20.972
<i>Everybody thinks
that success in America</i>

18:20.973 --> 18:23.477
<i>is in the amount of dollars that
you have. And that's not true.</i>

18:23.478 --> 18:25.314
The real true heroes
are people

18:25.315 --> 18:27.318
who go to work every day
and do their job

18:27.319 --> 18:29.924
and bring up their kids to
the best of their ability.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.928
<i>I wanted to be Hulk Hogan.</i>

18:31.929 --> 18:34.600
<i>I wanted to be Arnold. I
wanted to be Sylvester Stallone.</i>

18:34.601 --> 18:37.105
<i>Did you have heroes like that
growing up, when you were a kid?</i>

18:37.106 --> 18:40.045
<i>Yeah, we
did. We had heroes</i>

18:40.046 --> 18:43.519
<i>like Mickey Mantle,
Roger Maris.</i>

18:43.520 --> 18:45.856
<i>But I knew I could
never aspire to it</i>

18:45.857 --> 18:48.128
<i>because back then
you grew up,</i>

18:48.129 --> 18:50.466
<i>you graduated, you got
married and you had kids.</i>

18:50.467 --> 18:53.205
<i>Yeah, my dad
had the American dream--</i>

18:53.206 --> 18:55.377
<i>you know, marry your
high-school sweetheart,</i>

18:55.378 --> 18:58.951
<i>buy a house and take your
kids to see the Yankees.</i>

18:58.952 --> 19:00.955
<i>But things are
different now.</i>

19:00.956 --> 19:04.362
<i>And even baseball's changed
from when my dad was growing up.</i>

19:04.363 --> 19:06.367
<i>And now when I think
of baseball</i>

19:06.368 --> 19:08.738
<i>I don't think about the
Babe or Hammerin' Hank.</i>

19:11.678 --> 19:13.714
<i>I think of steroids.</i>

19:13.715 --> 19:18.492
<i>This one is a
monster! It is out of here!</i>

19:18.493 --> 19:22.733
<i>After the strike of
'94 baseball was almost dead.</i>

19:22.734 --> 19:24.837
<i>But then Mark McGuire
and Sammy Sosa</i>

19:24.838 --> 19:26.943
<i>started smashing
home runs,</i>

19:26.944 --> 19:29.180
<i>racing toward the
single-season record.</i>

19:29.181 --> 19:31.284
<i>You see,
about 1000 years ago</i>

19:31.285 --> 19:33.990
<i>Babe Ruth had 60 home
runs in one season.</i>

19:33.991 --> 19:35.827
<i>And then when my
parents were still kids</i>

19:35.828 --> 19:38.132
<i>Roger Maris hit
number 61.</i>

19:38.133 --> 19:40.771
<i>He was the home-run champ
for 37 years</i>

19:40.772 --> 19:44.044
<i>until Big Mac came along
and crushed that record</i>

19:44.045 --> 19:47.452
<i>with 70 home runs
and baseball was saved.</i>

19:47.453 --> 19:49.189
<i>Gone!</i>

19:49.190 --> 19:52.930
<i>Mark McGuire, you have just
broken the home-run record.</i>

19:52.931 --> 19:54.767
<i>What are you going
to do next?</i>

19:54.768 --> 19:56.236
We're going
to Disney World.

19:58.342 --> 20:01.281
<i>I guess Barry Bonds
wanted to go to Disney world too</i>

20:01.282 --> 20:02.783
<i>'cause in 2001</i>

20:02.784 --> 20:05.188
<i>he smashed 73 bombs
to break McGuire's record.</i>

20:05.189 --> 20:06.825
<i>This is the one!</i>

20:06.826 --> 20:08.829
<i>There's a new
record homer!</i>

20:08.830 --> 20:11.602
<i>See, baseball
players used to be scrawny,</i>

20:11.603 --> 20:14.474
<i>but now these guys were
jacked and it was cool.</i>

20:14.475 --> 20:16.880
<i>They started looking
like pro wrestlers.</i>

20:16.881 --> 20:20.186
If you were to
construct a home-run hitter

20:20.187 --> 20:23.593
in a lab, put him together,
he'd look like that.

20:23.594 --> 20:25.898
<i>Turns out, that was
kind of what was going on.</i>

20:25.899 --> 20:28.470
The man with ties
to some big-name athletes

20:28.471 --> 20:30.174
has been charged
with providing

20:30.175 --> 20:32.244
performance-enhancing
drugs to the pros.

20:32.245 --> 20:35.184
<i>The guy with the pencil-thin
mustache is Victor Conte.</i>

20:35.185 --> 20:37.789
<i>He used to be the bass
player for Tower of Power,</i>

20:37.790 --> 20:39.793
<i>but when that career
didn't work out</i>

20:39.794 --> 20:41.999
<i>he did what any failed
musician would do--</i>

20:42.000 --> 20:44.704
<i>he started selling undetectable
steroids to athletes.</i>

20:44.705 --> 20:46.742
Will you name names?

20:46.743 --> 20:48.579
There will be
naming of names.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.618
<i>Conte's files
named over 250 athletes,</i>

20:51.619 --> 20:55.259
<i>including the home-run
king himself, Barry Bonds.</i>

20:55.260 --> 20:57.363
<i>And then something
even crazier happened--</i>

20:57.364 --> 20:59.502
<i>Jose Canseco
wrote a book.</i>

20:59.503 --> 21:02.841
<i>The surprise wasn't that he was
literate, it's what he wrote about.</i>

21:02.842 --> 21:05.180
<i>He said he'd been taking
steroids since '86,</i>

21:05.181 --> 21:07.618
<i>that 80% of baseball
was on the juice</i>

21:07.619 --> 21:10.257
<i>and that he personally
injected his former bash brother</i>

21:10.258 --> 21:12.161
<i>Mark McGuire
in the ass.</i>

21:12.162 --> 21:13.364
But why, Mr. McGuire?

21:13.365 --> 21:15.702
Do you want to know
the terrifying truth

21:15.703 --> 21:17.973
or do you want to see me
sock a few dingers?

21:17.974 --> 21:19.911
Dingers!
Dingers!

21:20.713 --> 21:22.348
Ooh.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.554
All right,
Congress wants to haul

21:24.555 --> 21:26.090
a bunch of baseball players

21:26.091 --> 21:27.960
up to Capitol Hill
to talk about steroids.

21:27.961 --> 21:32.203
<i>In 2005 Congress
spent 151 days in session.</i>

21:32.204 --> 21:35.042
<i>They spent eight of those days
debating steroids in sports.</i>

21:35.043 --> 21:38.081
<i>That's more time than they
spent on national healthcare,</i>

21:38.082 --> 21:40.085
<i>why the levees broke
in New Orleans,</i>

21:40.086 --> 21:42.090
<i>and more than ending
the war in Iraq.</i>

21:42.091 --> 21:44.495
<i>Apparently,
the United States Congress</i>

21:44.496 --> 21:47.534
<i>takes this whole national
pastime thing kind of seriously.</i>

21:47.535 --> 21:50.541
I'm a baseball fan.
I always have been.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.213
Let me just start by saying
that I am a huge baseball fan.

21:53.214 --> 21:55.551
For me baseball is not a game,
it's a passion.

21:55.552 --> 21:57.722
We have every right
to be concerned

21:57.723 --> 22:00.829
that the national pastime
and all that it represents

22:00.830 --> 22:06.340
<i>has been threatened by the
selfish actions of a few.</i>

22:06.341 --> 22:09.747
There's something simply
un-American about this.

22:09.748 --> 22:13.254
<i>If using steroids makes
the Bash brothers un-American,</i>

22:13.255 --> 22:16.395
<i>what does that make
the Bell brothers?</i>

22:16.396 --> 22:19.768
Congressman Kanjorski, do you
think that this is not a matter

22:19.769 --> 22:21.638
for the U.S. Congress
to be deliberating?

22:21.639 --> 22:23.309
<i>I just don't think
it's necessary.</i>

22:23.310 --> 22:25.246
<i>Why are we just gonna
call seven people</i>

22:25.247 --> 22:26.649
<i>and of what importance
are they?</i>

22:26.650 --> 22:29.922
In the last 52 years
we've only done it 25 times.

22:29.923 --> 22:31.926
14 of those times were

22:31.927 --> 22:33.530
by the un-American
activities committee.

22:35.635 --> 22:38.540
Are you now or have ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

22:38.541 --> 22:41.379
Well, sir, I'm not here
to talk about the past.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.953
I have never
used steroids, period.

22:44.954 --> 22:47.960
Did you know that other
players were using steroids?

22:47.961 --> 22:51.668
I have never seen a syringe.
I have never seen steroids.

22:51.669 --> 22:54.173
But in locker-room gossip--
you may not have seen it.

22:54.174 --> 22:56.745
People talk, right? "this guy's doing
something, that guy's doing something."

22:56.746 --> 23:00.119
Now Mr. McGuire, would you
like to comment on that?

23:00.120 --> 23:02.557
<i>You don't want
to comment?</i>

23:02.558 --> 23:03.960
Are you taking the fifth?

23:05.765 --> 23:08.636
This is about values.
It's about our culture.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.108
It's about who we
define ourselves to be.

23:11.109 --> 23:13.981
When we want to define
to a foreign country

23:13.982 --> 23:17.454
what we're about and
you're gonna show a film,

23:17.455 --> 23:19.826
what would you
go show?

23:19.827 --> 23:21.830
<i>Hey, how about "Rocky IV"?</i>

23:21.831 --> 23:23.601
<i>There's nothing
more American than that.</i>

23:23.602 --> 23:26.373
<i>The big Russian trains
in a high-tech facility</i>

23:26.374 --> 23:29.045
<i>with a whole team
of scientists and trainers,</i>

23:29.046 --> 23:32.018
<i>and of course
he takes steroids.</i>

23:32.019 --> 23:33.822
<i>Meanwhile, Rocky's
out there lifting logs,</i>

23:33.823 --> 23:37.730
<i>chopping wood, training in
a barn the all-natural way,</i>

23:37.731 --> 23:40.469
<i>'cause only Commies would
take steroids, right?</i>

23:40.470 --> 23:43.174
<i>Sure, Sly,
whatever you say.</i>

23:43.175 --> 23:45.580
Truth is, steroids were
the secret weapon

23:45.581 --> 23:47.384
that helped American
fight the Russians

23:47.385 --> 23:49.087
on the Olympic
battlefield.

23:49.088 --> 23:51.091
And it all
began here,

23:51.092 --> 23:53.429
York BarHenry
in Pennsylvania.

23:53.430 --> 23:55.433
<i>When you
were an Olympic coach</i>

23:55.434 --> 23:58.039
<i>did you see a lot of
steroid use going on?</i>

23:58.040 --> 24:00.544
Much.

24:00.545 --> 24:01.980
- Yeah.
- Much.

24:01.981 --> 24:05.287
<i>Smitty's 83,
one of the old-timers.</i>

24:05.288 --> 24:08.728
<i>He was the coach of the Olympic
weight-lifting team back then.</i>

24:08.636 --> 24:10.607
Was it ever thought of
as cheating at that point?

24:10.608 --> 24:14.716
No. No, because we figured
everybody was taking it.

24:15.102 --> 24:17.105
We figured
even steven.

24:17.106 --> 24:19.643
<i>Smitty told me the story
about how anabolic steroids</i>

24:19.644 --> 24:21.547
<i>were first introduced
to the U.S. Olympic team.</i>

24:21.548 --> 24:23.650
<i>It was the late 1950s</i>

24:23.651 --> 24:26.356
<i>and the Russians were
dominating America</i>

24:26.357 --> 24:27.958
<i>in the space race
and at the Olympics.</i>

24:27.959 --> 24:31.398
<i>But one night the
Russian coach got drunk</i>

24:31.399 --> 24:33.369
<i>and told
the American coach</i>

24:33.370 --> 24:35.873
<i>they'd been injecting their
athletes with steroids.</i>

24:35.874 --> 24:37.543
<i>The American coach
raced home</i>

24:37.544 --> 24:39.647
<i>and developed an even more
powerful steroid</i>

24:39.648 --> 24:42.885
<i>specifically
for team U.S.A.</i>

24:42.886 --> 24:46.826
<i>So if steroids actually helped
America beat the commies,</i>

24:46.827 --> 24:49.665
<i>How did it get
such a bad rap?</i>

24:49.666 --> 24:52.737
<i>Last week former
N.F.L. Defensive lineman Lyle Alzado</i>

24:52.738 --> 24:55.809
<i>told N.B.C. News that
steroids were the cause</i>

24:55.810 --> 24:58.113
<i>of his inoperable
brain cancer.</i>

24:58.114 --> 24:59.750
How long were you
on steroids?

24:59.751 --> 25:01.753
Most of my
pro career.

25:01.754 --> 25:04.158
You know,
I played 16 years.

25:04.159 --> 25:06.930
And it got me where I wanted
but also got me very sick.

25:06.931 --> 25:08.666
<i>Lyle Alzado went from being</i>

25:08.667 --> 25:10.670
<i>the toughest son of
a bitch in the N.F.L.</i>

25:10.671 --> 25:12.673
<i>to being a sad
dying man.</i>

25:12.674 --> 25:15.613
<i>Everything I saw on T.V.
taught me that steroids kill.</i>

25:15.614 --> 25:18.084
Some alarming news
about steroid use tonight.

25:18.085 --> 25:20.053
<i>A drug bust
in Phoenix, Arizona,</i>

25:20.054 --> 25:21.924
<i>not for heroin
or cocaine,</i>

25:21.925 --> 25:24.262
<i>but for something
just as dangerous.</i>

25:24.263 --> 25:26.266
Health damage from steroids
can include

25:26.267 --> 25:28.870
heart, joint
and reproductive problems,

25:28.871 --> 25:30.306
this is a drug
that kills.

25:30.307 --> 25:32.844
What happens is that
these retarded idiots

25:32.845 --> 25:34.848
that give us the news,
these talking heads

25:34.849 --> 25:37.819
that babble on T.V.
give us this rhetoric

25:37.820 --> 25:39.823
that comes from
not one single expert.

25:39.824 --> 25:43.363
And they say ridiculous things
like steroids will kill you,

25:43.364 --> 25:45.434
they'll rot your kidneys,
they'll give you cancer,

25:45.435 --> 25:47.604
they'll do all these horrible
things that are just not true.

25:47.605 --> 25:50.843
<i>John Romano is the senior
editor of a bodybuilding magazine</i>

25:50.844 --> 25:53.515
<i>and he disagrees with what his
media colleagues think of steroids.</i>

25:53.516 --> 25:55.619
Well, how come we hear
constantly in the news

25:55.620 --> 25:57.556
that people are dying
through taking steroids?

25:57.557 --> 25:59.559
- Show me the bodies.
- Lyle Alzado.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.563
Lyle Alzado didn't die
from steroids.

26:01.564 --> 26:02.899
I trained with him
for two years.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.236
He didn't die from steroids.
He died from a brain tumor.

26:05.237 --> 26:07.908
I don't know of any of
my colleagues that link

26:07.909 --> 26:11.047
his central nervous system
lymphoma to his use of steroids.

26:11.048 --> 26:13.051

<i>- Are steroids killing people?
- good question.</i>

26:20.699 --> 26:22.702
They've been
used in medicine

26:22.703 --> 26:24.705
since the late 1930s.

26:24.706 --> 26:27.010
I hope we haven't been
purposely killing people.

26:27.011 --> 26:29.648
Can they be used safely?
Yeah.

26:29.649 --> 26:33.789
These drugs are a boon
in the medical profession.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.527
They're a miracle drug for
people with muscle wasting.

26:36.528 --> 26:40.000
They are a miracle drug
for burn victims,

26:40.001 --> 26:43.540
for cancer patients, people
recovering from surgery.

26:43.541 --> 26:45.911
<i>And for people with
A.I.D.S. like Jeff Taylor.</i>

26:45.912 --> 26:48.816
<i>Jeff has been fighting
H.I.V. for 25 years</i>

26:48.817 --> 26:50.920
<i>and he says
steroids saved his life.</i>

26:50.921 --> 26:54.327
Back in '92 I was
down to two "T" cells

26:54.328 --> 26:57.433
and very sick. I'd
developed P.C.P. pneumonia.

26:57.434 --> 26:59.770
Both my lungs collapsed.
I almost didn't make it.

26:59.771 --> 27:02.342
I came out of a hospital
weighing 125 lbs.

27:02.343 --> 27:05.681
<i>So I started researching and
found a clinical trial in L.A.</i>

27:05.682 --> 27:08.252
<i>They were studying Anavar,
an old bodybuilding drug,</i>

27:08.253 --> 27:10.857
<i>to test how it worked
for people with H.I.V.</i>

27:10.858 --> 27:13.161
So I signed myself up,
got a fairly high dose

27:13.162 --> 27:15.164
and responded amazingly.

27:15.165 --> 27:19.072
I gained 30 lbs
in six weeks

27:19.073 --> 27:20.975
and I gained
300 "T" cells.

27:20.976 --> 27:23.046
<i>So these drugs
have cognitive powers--</i>

27:23.047 --> 27:24.582
<i>if you're sick
they'll help you;</i>

27:24.583 --> 27:26.519
<i>if you're a healthy athlete
they'll kill you?</i>

27:26.520 --> 27:30.026
How can you say steroids are
a national public health crisis

27:30.027 --> 27:33.399
when you have people dropping dead at
a rate you can measure by the minute

27:33.400 --> 27:35.301
as a result
of alcohol and tobacco?

27:35.302 --> 27:37.606
<i>According to the C.D.C.,</i>

27:37.607 --> 27:41.179
<i>tobacco kills about 435,000
Americans every year,</i>

27:41.180 --> 27:44.852
<i>alcohol kills
about 75,000,</i>

27:44.853 --> 27:47.992
<i>and deaths from anabolic
steroid abuse-- three.</i>

27:47.993 --> 27:51.265
<i>But steroids also show up
in some other statistics--</i>

27:51.266 --> 27:53.268
<i>emergency room visits.</i>

27:53.269 --> 27:55.338
<i>But it's not exactly
number one on the list--</i>

27:55.339 --> 27:57.776
<i>that would be alcohol;
or number two--</i>

27:57.777 --> 27:59.780
<i>that's cocaine;</i>

27:59.781 --> 28:02.151
<i>or number three--
that's marijuana.</i>

28:02.152 --> 28:04.489
<i>Gotta be top 10,
though, right?</i>

28:04.490 --> 28:06.492
<i>Uh, not quite.</i>

28:06.493 --> 28:08.496
<i>How about top 25?</i>

28:08.497 --> 28:10.867
<i>Top 100?
Keep going.</i>

28:10.868 --> 28:12.871
<i>Try number 142.</i>

28:12.872 --> 28:14.874
<i>That's even
after multivitamins.</i>

28:14.875 --> 28:17.813

watch out for

28:22.355 --> 28:24.759
is emChrisishing.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.297
<i>If you look
at "Reefer Madness,"</i>

28:27.298 --> 28:30.836
<i>it caused you to be a
stark-raving, murdering lunatic--</i>

28:30.837 --> 28:33.509
Very funny to watch because
it goes so over the edge.

28:33.510 --> 28:36.848
The next tragedy may be
that of your daughter,

28:36.849 --> 28:39.920
of your son,
or yours.

28:41.958 --> 28:44.695
<i>Physicians and sports
scientists have done that</i>

28:44.696 --> 28:46.900
with the best of
intentions in this area--

28:46.901 --> 28:49.071
"Oh, steroids
are going to cause you

28:49.072 --> 28:52.877
<i>to drop over dead
in your tracks" and so on.</i>

28:52.878 --> 28:55.449
And the athletes are looking
around saying, "Jesus,

28:55.450 --> 28:57.486
haven't seen
that many guys die."

28:57.487 --> 28:59.489
<i>Are steroids
killing people?</i>

28:59.490 --> 29:01.493
Steroids clearly are
killing people

29:01.494 --> 29:03.497
both in the short term
and in the long term.

29:03.498 --> 29:06.836
<i>Dr. Gary Wadler is an advisor
to the world anti-doping agency</i>

29:06.837 --> 29:09.741
<i>and the media's go-to guy
when it comes to steroids.</i>

29:09.742 --> 29:11.746
We know it's been associated

29:11.747 --> 29:13.749
with stroke
in young people

29:13.750 --> 29:17.088
for which there was no
other obvious explanation.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.094
We know it's been
associated with heart attacks

29:20.095 --> 29:23.133
for which there was no
other obvious explanation.

29:23.134 --> 29:24.802
We know
it increases clotting.

29:24.803 --> 29:27.708
What bothers me are people
like Dr. Gary Wadler

29:27.709 --> 29:30.279
who's a physician
and going before Congress

29:30.280 --> 29:32.517
and saying these things,
and when confronted--

29:32.518 --> 29:34.521
"Please produce
a single article

29:34.522 --> 29:37.726
that shows any of this in any
scientific way," can't do it.

29:37.727 --> 29:40.598
<i>Dr. Norm Fost is a
professor of medical ethics</i>

29:40.599 --> 29:43.403
<i>with a research focus on
performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

29:43.404 --> 29:45.874
So I'm not denying
that there aren't

29:45.875 --> 29:48.446
some serious adverse effects
from anabolic steroids.

29:48.447 --> 29:51.117
<i>It's just that we haven't been
able to demonstrate any of them.</i>

29:51.118 --> 29:52.787
<i>Maybe that's because
we don't study them.</i>

29:52.788 --> 29:55.392
One of the problems
with the ban on steroids

29:55.393 --> 29:57.729
is that it's impossible
to do the kind of research

29:57.730 --> 29:59.165
that would answer
these questions.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.870
Some purists would like
to see those studies done.

30:01.871 --> 30:04.041
Well, I can assure you
they never will be done.

30:04.042 --> 30:06.980
It would be a totally
unethical study to do.

30:06.981 --> 30:09.718
So we have to use the
information we have at hand.

30:09.719 --> 30:12.089
Depression, convulsions,

30:12.090 --> 30:14.994
anxiety, jaundice,

30:14.995 --> 30:17.633
myocardial infarction--
which is heart attack--

30:17.634 --> 30:19.636
eczema, abscess,

30:19.637 --> 30:21.840
vaginal pain,
vaginal discharge.

30:21.841 --> 30:25.413
You wanna know what I'm reading
this from? What does that say?

30:25.414 --> 30:26.849
- "Vitamin c."
- Thank you.

30:26.850 --> 30:29.755
I mean, look, peanuts are
dangerous. You understand?

30:29.756 --> 30:32.627
There are people
that take a peanut

30:32.628 --> 30:36.333
and have a peanut and they
go into anaphylactic shock.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.172
<i>Okay? The airway closes
up. That's it. They die.</i>

30:39.173 --> 30:41.810
Now does that mean
that we ban peanuts

30:41.811 --> 30:44.348
and sue God
for making them?

30:44.349 --> 30:46.251
<i>- No.
- Right.</i>

30:46.252 --> 30:49.324
What we do is we say,
"okay, peanut warnings."

30:49.325 --> 30:51.328
There is no safe drug.

30:51.329 --> 30:53.899
There is no safe drug
that ever exists.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.537
There's always
the benefit-to-risk ratio.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.541
You name the drug--
"X" percent of people

30:58.542 --> 31:00.544
<i>will suffer
adverse effects.</i>

31:00.545 --> 31:02.682
<i>Do you feel
any side effects ever?</i>

31:02.683 --> 31:04.919
<i>Yeah, I've had
some side effects--</i>

31:04.920 --> 31:07.457
acne, hair growth.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.661
Some side effects
that I've had are--

31:09.662 --> 31:11.799
<i>What do you mean by hair
growth? On your head?</i>

31:11.800 --> 31:13.869
No, just on my chest
and my back and stuff.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.739
I never break out.
My back doesn't break out.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.743
I don't get hairy
from it.

31:17.744 --> 31:19.713
You get a little
testicular atrophy,

31:19.714 --> 31:21.683
but then they come back.
It's normal.

31:21.684 --> 31:23.519
<i>- Your balls shrank?
- The balls shank.</i>

31:23.520 --> 31:25.156
<i>- Who needs 'em?
- Who needs 'em?</i>

31:25.157 --> 31:27.294
What about testosterone?
I have some friends who say

31:27.295 --> 31:29.965
it is like a wonder drug.
It makes them feel great.

31:29.966 --> 31:32.803
It makes them feel,
you know, frisky

31:32.804 --> 31:35.542
<i>and young and it's
great for their skin.</i>

31:35.543 --> 31:38.014
The negative side effects would
be my lovely singing voice,

31:38.015 --> 31:40.183
<i>hair like a monkey
from my head to my toes,</i>

31:40.184 --> 31:43.390
I mean, hair growing out places
you don't even want to talk about.

31:43.391 --> 31:45.460
I mean,
I want to stay feminine.

31:45.461 --> 31:47.463
And I think that's why
I get so much work.

31:47.464 --> 31:49.467
It's because I still
look like a woman

31:49.468 --> 31:51.338
and I still have
hard muscles.

31:51.339 --> 31:53.107
<i>In my experience,</i>

31:53.108 --> 31:55.545
<i>steroids are just gonna make
you more of whatever you are.</i>

31:55.546 --> 31:58.685
If you're a jerk
and you take steroids

31:58.686 --> 32:01.790
<i>- You're a super jerk, right?
- An asshole.</i>

32:01.791 --> 32:04.061
You've seen that, right? You
go beyond. You're an asshole.

32:04.062 --> 32:05.798
<i>I've never seen Roid Rage.</i>

32:05.799 --> 32:08.636
I've never seen any
difference in his personality

32:08.637 --> 32:11.307
or how he is with me,
how he is with Jake.

32:11.308 --> 32:13.311
<i>It hasn't done
anything</i>

32:13.312 --> 32:16.350
that all those after-school
specials tell you that it's gonna do.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.187
Bryce, I gotta
get bigger, man.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.858
- Here, this might help.
- Steroids?

32:20.859 --> 32:23.062
<i>What is going on with you?</i>

32:23.063 --> 32:24.732
God damn it!

32:35.119 --> 32:37.322
<i>While I was visiting
my brother and his family</i>

32:37.323 --> 32:39.993
<i>they told me they were
thinking of having another child</i>

32:39.994 --> 32:43.667
<i>but that another possible side
effect of steroids was on their minds.</i>

32:43.668 --> 32:45.036
<i>If you couldn't have
another kid</i>

32:45.037 --> 32:46.839
<i>would it be something
that you'd regret</i>

32:46.840 --> 32:48.342
<i>because you did
steroids?</i>

32:48.343 --> 32:51.281
Yeah. If it was
simply from that, yeah.

32:51.282 --> 32:53.919
I'd probably regret it.
But there's a lot of things

32:53.920 --> 32:56.424
people regret in their
lives, so I'm not, you know--

32:56.425 --> 32:59.863
it's a decision I made and it's
a decision I'll have to live with,

32:59.864 --> 33:01.833
whatever
the consequences are.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.617
<i>It's been 15
years since Alzado died.</i>

33:10.618 --> 33:13.121
- Why did you lie to me?
- I was afraid...

33:13.122 --> 33:15.425
<i>Looking back at
Maria Shriver's interview</i>

33:15.426 --> 33:17.428
<i>I can't help
but wonder,</i>

33:17.429 --> 33:19.933
<i>why wasn't she asking
the real questions like</i>

33:19.934 --> 33:22.438
<i>"is this gonna happen
to my husband?"</i>

33:22.439 --> 33:24.475
<i>Did she really
believe Lyle</i>

33:24.476 --> 33:26.479
<i>or was this
just the beginning</i>

33:26.480 --> 33:29.517
<i>of the steroid myth?</i>

33:29.518 --> 33:32.356
<i>And even though the experts
know a lot more about steroids,</i>

33:32.357 --> 33:34.560
<i>you sure wouldn't know it
from watching the news.</i>

33:34.561 --> 33:37.065
Tonight, one of the nation's
most serious drug problems

33:37.066 --> 33:40.103
and it's only getting worse.
It's steroids.

33:40.104 --> 33:42.107
Professional wrestler
Chris Benoit

33:42.108 --> 33:44.512
killed his wife,
his seven-year-old son,

33:44.513 --> 33:45.947
and then hung himself.

33:45.948 --> 33:48.820
<i>Why did he do it?
Steroids found in the house.</i>

33:48.821 --> 33:51.123
Steroids cause
suicidal tendencies.

33:51.124 --> 33:52.827
<i>They hallucinate.
They hear voices.</i>

33:52.828 --> 33:54.697
<i>Depression, paranoia.</i>

33:54.698 --> 33:56.701
Steroids could be
the actual cause...

33:56.702 --> 33:58.036
Speculation
is running wild.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.640
Do you think these drugs
could affect one's mind?

33:59.641 --> 34:00.842
Now we know.

34:00.843 --> 34:02.845
- Testosterone...
- Steroids...

34:06.519 --> 34:08.155
<i>Let's cut through the crap.</i>

34:08.156 --> 34:10.827
<i>This is steroids 101.</i>

34:10.828 --> 34:12.897
<i>First of all,
the term "steroids"</i>

34:12.898 --> 34:16.335
<i>Is often misused to describe
any performance-enhancing drug</i>

34:16.337 --> 34:18.607
<i>When in fact
many of these drugs</i>

34:18.608 --> 34:20.578
<i>are not actually
steroids at all.</i>

34:20.579 --> 34:22.882
<i>So what are steroids?</i>

34:22.882 --> 34:24.886
<i>Well, steroids are
synthetic versions</i>

34:24.887 --> 34:27.591
<i>of hormones that your body
produces naturally,</i>

34:27.592 --> 34:29.594
<i>like cortisone--
that's a steroid.</i>

34:29.596 --> 34:32.166
<i>It signals the body
to break down inflammation.</i>

34:32.167 --> 34:34.168
<i>Birth control pills
are steroids too</i>

34:34.170 --> 34:36.005
<i>Made from the female
sex hormones</i>

34:36.007 --> 34:37.842
<i>estrogen
and progesterone.</i>

34:37.842 --> 34:40.380
<i>But the steroids that get
all the negative attention</i>

34:40.382 --> 34:42.051
<i>are anabolic steroids,</i>

34:42.052 --> 34:44.455
<i>Made from the male
sex hormone testosterone</i>

34:44.456 --> 34:47.193
<i>which tells the body to
increase muscle size and strength</i>

34:47.194 --> 34:49.264
<i>and helps to recover
from workouts faster.</i>

34:49.264 --> 34:52.437
<i>Like any drug, anabolic
steroids do have side effects.</i>

34:52.438 --> 34:55.442
<i>And if you abuse them the
side effects will be worse.</i>

34:55.443 --> 34:57.579
<i>For men,
they can cause acne,</i>

34:57.580 --> 34:59.616
<i>hair growth,
raised cholesterol,</i>

34:59.617 --> 35:02.254
<i>shrink your testicles
and lower your sperm count,</i>

35:02.255 --> 35:04.224
<i>which could even
make you sterile.</i>

35:04.225 --> 35:05.894
<i>But all of these
side effects</i>

35:05.895 --> 35:07.897
<i>are reversible
when you go off the drugs.</i>

35:07.898 --> 35:10.168
<i>Otherwise, steroids
don't cause baldness,</i>

35:10.169 --> 35:11.905
<i>but if it runs
in your family</i>

35:11.906 --> 35:13.641
<i>they might make you
go bald faster.</i>

35:13.642 --> 35:15.846
<i>And they can also cause
gynecomastia,</i>

35:15.847 --> 35:17.983
<i>or what the gym rats call
"bitch tits."</i>

35:17.984 --> 35:20.721
<i>For women, in addition
to acne and hair growth,</i>

35:20.722 --> 35:23.660
<i>steroids can cause a deepened
voice, menstrual problems</i>

35:23.661 --> 35:25.663
<i>and can enlarge
the clitoris.</i>

35:25.664 --> 35:27.667
<i>And some of these
are not reversible.</i>

35:27.668 --> 35:29.671
<i>And for kids,
some experts think</i>

35:29.672 --> 35:32.676
<i>steroids can stunt growth by
closing growth plates prematurely.</i>

35:32.677 --> 35:34.747
<i>But that's actually
never been proven.</i>

35:34.748 --> 35:38.387
<i>There's also no proof that steroids
cause cancer, kidney failure,</i>

35:38.388 --> 35:40.358
<i>and only oral steroids
in high dosages</i>

35:40.359 --> 35:42.394
<i>can cause
liver problems.</i>

35:42.395 --> 35:45.167
<i>And it's true that steroids
can be one of 1000 risk factors</i>

35:45.168 --> 35:47.938
<i>that could lead to heart
disease, but then again</i>

35:47.939 --> 35:50.709
<i>low testosterone is
another big risk factor.</i>

35:50.710 --> 35:53.582
<i>And Roid Rage? Steroids
can increase aggression,</i>

35:53.583 --> 35:56.720
<i>but that only happens in
about 5% of the population.</i>

35:56.721 --> 35:59.960
<i>And even then, they
can't make you psychotic.</i>

35:59.961 --> 36:02.398
<i>And as for the long-term
side effects,</i>

36:02.399 --> 36:05.403
<i>we don't know. No one's
ever done those studies.</i>

36:05.404 --> 36:08.676
At what point do we say
that a behavior is such

36:08.677 --> 36:11.949
that people just shouldn't
be allowed to engage in it?

36:11.950 --> 36:14.386
I mean, we do
allow people

36:14.387 --> 36:17.225
to do lots of things
that can hurt themselves.

36:17.226 --> 36:20.397
<i>America's new
junkies-- plastic surgery addicts.</i>

36:20.398 --> 36:22.401
I've had my eyes done,

36:22.402 --> 36:25.373
rhinoplasty, chin cleft,

36:25.374 --> 36:28.713
pectoral implants,
bicep implants,

36:28.714 --> 36:31.151
buttock augmentation.

36:31.152 --> 36:33.522
And those are the ones
I can remember right offhand.

36:33.523 --> 36:36.126
<i>Common sense tells
you this is dangerous and foolish.</i>

36:36.127 --> 36:38.964
<i>You wouldn't risk your neck
in a trick like this.</i>

36:38.965 --> 36:41.502
<i>Common sense tells us that
being shot out of a cannon</i>

36:41.503 --> 36:43.941
<i>Is dangerous business.
Handling dynamite--</i>

36:43.942 --> 36:45.510
<i>This too
looks dangerous.</i>

36:45.511 --> 36:48.148
<i>Whether
it's bungee jumping</i>

36:48.149 --> 36:50.986
<i>or skydiving</i>

36:50.987 --> 36:52.990
<i>or black-diamond
skiing--</i>

36:52.991 --> 36:55.829
<i>All of them
are fun to do</i>

36:55.830 --> 36:59.202
But would subject one
to tremendous risks

36:59.203 --> 37:01.172
with no real
necessity.

37:01.173 --> 37:05.112
And so if we allow
all of those other risks,

37:05.113 --> 37:07.650
why is it that we're
taking this position

37:07.651 --> 37:09.654
with respect
to anabolic steroids?

37:09.655 --> 37:13.461
<i>And it's a fair start.</i>

37:13.462 --> 37:16.099
<i>1988, Seoul, Korea.</i>

37:16.100 --> 37:18.504
<i>A Canadian sprinter

37:38.608 --> 37:41.847
over the idea
that this Canadian sprinter

37:41.848 --> 37:44.919
<i>had gotten an advantage
based on his use</i>

37:44.920 --> 37:48.125
<i>of anabolic steroids
for its performance effect.</i>

37:48.126 --> 37:50.796
And Congress responded
by holding some hearings.

37:50.797 --> 37:53.100
Ben Johnson would not
have been in the finals.

37:53.101 --> 37:55.572
He probably would not have
been on the Olympic team

37:55.573 --> 37:57.475
<i>had he not
taken steroids.</i>

37:57.476 --> 38:00.247
<i>Congress wanted to pass
a law that would control steroids</i>

38:00.248 --> 38:02.351
<i>the same way as drugs
like cocaine and heroin</i>

38:02.352 --> 38:04.722
<i>and they called experts
from the D.E.A.,</i>

38:04.723 --> 38:07.962
<i>the F.D.A. and the American
Medical Association.</i>

38:07.963 --> 38:10.766
<i>But they all testified that
steroids should not be treated</i>

38:10.767 --> 38:14.006
<i>like illicit drugs. So Congress
disregarded their experts</i>

38:14.007 --> 38:18.013
<i>and in 1990 they passed the
Anabolic Steroid Control Act,</i>

38:18.014 --> 38:21.386
<i>turning non-medical users
into federal drug criminals.</i>

38:21.387 --> 38:24.558
<i>This wasn't so
much about health effects.</i>

38:24.559 --> 38:28.566
It was really on what
these things do that's good

38:28.567 --> 38:31.070
in the sense that
they build muscle,

38:31.071 --> 38:34.009
they improve the way
that people can perform.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.680
And that
in a sports context

38:36.681 --> 38:38.751
was seen
as the ultimate evil.

38:38.752 --> 38:41.489
If we took a pie chart
of steroid use

38:41.490 --> 38:44.795
and we looked at
what percentage of that pie

38:44.796 --> 38:47.333
<i>is comprised
of athletes</i>

38:47.334 --> 38:50.239
<i>it would be a very very
small slice of that pie.</i>

38:50.240 --> 38:53.010
<i>The overwhelming
majority of the pie</i>

38:53.011 --> 38:56.517
<i>is comprised of the
recreational gym rat</i>

38:56.518 --> 38:59.088
<i>who's doing it purely
for cosmetic reasons.</i>

38:59.089 --> 39:01.693
The irony is
that we've addressed

39:01.694 --> 39:03.697
a sports cheating issue

39:03.698 --> 39:05.801
by creating a law

39:05.802 --> 39:08.372
that affects all the folks
who aren't cheating in sports.

39:08.373 --> 39:10.910
<i>One look at
Gregory Valentino's arms</i>

39:10.911 --> 39:12.914
<i>and you know
something's going on.</i>

39:12.915 --> 39:15.418
<i>The 40-year-old is charged
with criminal possession</i>

39:15.419 --> 39:17.889
<i>of anabolic steroids
with intent to sell.</i>

39:17.890 --> 39:19.994
<i>Some people may
call Gregg Valentino</i>

39:19.995 --> 39:22.130
<i>a freak and a felon.
I call him a neighbor.</i>

39:22.131 --> 39:24.401
<i>He lives down the
block from my grandma.</i>

39:24.402 --> 39:26.839
<i>He also happens to have the
biggest biceps in the world.</i>

39:26.840 --> 39:28.509
Holy crap.

39:28.510 --> 39:30.112
Do you have difficulty
with just sort of

39:30.113 --> 39:32.483
the regular things in life,
like making a sandwich?

39:32.484 --> 39:35.121
No. No no.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.758
I can hit a 90-mile-an-hour
fastball.

39:36.759 --> 39:38.427
Any body wants to
challenge me-- let's do it.

39:38.428 --> 39:39.796
<i>I'll show you.
Watch this.</i>

39:39.797 --> 39:42.434
Oh! Oh! Oh!

39:42.435 --> 39:44.438
Come on, Gregg.

39:44.439 --> 39:46.107
Oof!

39:46.108 --> 39:49.113
I told you
I'm no Barry Bonds.

39:49.114 --> 39:52.386
<i>I'm a red-meat man.
I eat a lot of red meat.</i>

39:52.387 --> 39:54.556
<i>Why do you think people
in America are so uptight</i>

39:54.557 --> 39:56.961
<i>About steroids
and steroid users?</i>

39:56.962 --> 39:59.800
Because they fear--

39:59.801 --> 40:03.173
they fear
what they don't know.

40:03.174 --> 40:05.944
You know?

40:05.945 --> 40:08.549
That's ugly. Who the hell
would want to look like that?

40:08.550 --> 40:10.051
I don't want
to look like that.

40:10.052 --> 40:11.955
Why did you want to look
like that then?

40:11.956 --> 40:14.326
Um, I mean,
I like being big.

40:14.327 --> 40:16.229
<i>I had small-man complex, you know.</i>

40:16.230 --> 40:18.133
<i>I'd be like, "I don't
want to be little."</i>

40:18.134 --> 40:21.005
I wanted to be taller. I couldn't
grow taller, so I grew wider.

40:21.006 --> 40:23.677
<i>Personally I think in the
picture that you showed me--</i>

40:23.678 --> 40:25.881
- Oh, I look better.
- Your arms look a lot better there

40:25.882 --> 40:29.855
- than they look now, right? Wouldn't you agree?
- Without a doubt.

40:29.856 --> 40:32.192
I would rather look like
that. Do you think girls

40:32.193 --> 40:34.162
look at me and go,
"oh My God, that's hot"?

40:34.163 --> 40:36.400
They like...
"that's --ing gross."

40:36.401 --> 40:39.606
I walk into a club and the hottest
girl could be there with her boyfriend

40:39.607 --> 40:41.777
and her boyfriend
will see me

40:41.778 --> 40:43.813
and mush her in the face
to get over to me

40:43.814 --> 40:46.117
just to say to me, like,
"dude, what the --?"

40:46.118 --> 40:48.388
You're getting attention from
the guys, not from the girl.

40:48.389 --> 40:50.993
I don't give a shit. It's
attention. I can't explain it to you.

40:50.994 --> 40:53.464
It's like a mindset. Does
that make sense or no?

40:53.465 --> 40:55.468
But I tell you what--
when I'm done

40:55.469 --> 40:58.106
my biceps are humongous,
humongous.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.643
Like that-- bam!

40:59.644 --> 41:01.646
For myself, I'm kind of
on the fence.

41:01.647 --> 41:03.650
I have two brothers.
They're both taking steroids

41:03.651 --> 41:05.186
right as we speak
right now.

41:05.187 --> 41:07.190
I don't know
if I want people

41:07.191 --> 41:09.194
to think
I'm not cheating

41:09.195 --> 41:11.130
or to look at me
and say,

41:11.131 --> 41:14.203
"Wow, you know, you
really have a great build."

41:14.204 --> 41:17.241
<i>But do you think I should
take steroids to get there?</i>

41:17.242 --> 41:20.614
I think steroids are
as American as apple pie.

41:20.615 --> 41:22.351
We live in a society
today that--

41:22.352 --> 41:24.856
<i>You got M.T.V.
And reality shows,</i>

41:24.857 --> 41:27.293
<i>Madonna's making out
with Britney Spears,</i>

41:27.294 --> 41:30.165
Rap music and all that shit, and
you're worried about steroids?

41:30.166 --> 41:32.636
Kids are like, "--
you, cop. -- you, man,"

41:32.637 --> 41:35.842
<i>Playing video games like grand
theft auto where you're killing cops.</i>

41:35.843 --> 41:39.449
That's worse influence in my
opinion than steroids will ever be,

41:39.450 --> 41:41.452
<i>than Barry Bonds
hitting home runs.</i>

41:41.453 --> 41:44.391
There's a big difference
between a kid taking steroids

41:44.392 --> 41:46.896
<i>who's only had hair on
his dick a couple of years,</i>

41:46.897 --> 41:49.968
<i>as opposed to a grown man
who's looking to perform better</i>

41:49.969 --> 41:52.238
<i>At a better level
in sports.</i>

41:52.239 --> 41:54.242
And where is Schwarzenegger
in all this?

41:54.243 --> 41:56.246
I mean, he is the
poster boy for steroids.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.851
He's the poster boy for "hey,
look, look at me, look what I did.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.888
<i>I came, I conquered,
I kicked ass."</i>

42:00.889 --> 42:04.428
That autobiography says he
was doing it when he was 15-16.

42:04.429 --> 42:08.769
<i>Hey, he won Mr. Universe
at 19 years old-- 19.</i>

42:08.770 --> 42:11.073
<i>Did you ever see what he
looked like when he was 19?</i>

42:11.074 --> 42:13.311
Do you think it was god-given
genetics or do you think

42:13.312 --> 42:15.215
<i>that maybe he took the
performance enhancers?</i>

42:15.216 --> 42:17.218
<i>A lot of people
idolize these guys,</i>

42:17.219 --> 42:20.357
<i>whether it's a rock star, a
bodybuilder, a movie star, whoever,</i>

42:20.358 --> 42:22.928
and all of a sudden
you get to meet them

42:22.929 --> 42:24.732
and, man,
is it a let-down.

42:24.733 --> 42:28.706
<i>Because they're never ever
what they appear to be.</i>

42:28.707 --> 42:30.710
The guy you see
in public like this

42:30.711 --> 42:34.048
has got the middle finger
under the table going like this.

42:34.049 --> 42:36.420
It's never "what you see
is what you get."

42:36.421 --> 42:38.657
It's "what you see is
what they want you to see."

42:38.658 --> 42:40.995
Everybody idolized
Schwarzenegger growing up.

42:40.996 --> 42:43.499
<i>Everybody thought,
"man, I wanna lift weights</i>

42:43.500 --> 42:45.503
<i>and life a pure life
like Arnold.</i>

42:45.504 --> 42:48.442
<i>And I'm gonna eat all my vegetables
and take my protein shakes.</i>

42:48.443 --> 42:51.448
<i>Maybe I'll move out to
California, train at Gold's Gym.</i>

42:51.449 --> 42:53.685
<i>And I'm gonna get really
big. I'm gonna win contests.</i>

42:53.686 --> 42:55.421
<i>I'm gonna be
a movie star too."</i>

42:55.422 --> 42:57.058
<i>Please welcome a man</i>

42:57.059 --> 43:00.530
<i>whose story embodies
the American dream.</i>

43:00.531 --> 43:02.534
One thing I learned
about America is

43:02.535 --> 43:05.640
that if you work hard and
if you play by the rules

43:05.641 --> 43:08.011
this country is truly
open to you.

43:08.012 --> 43:10.583
You can achieve
anything.

43:10.584 --> 43:13.421
Dude, that is--

43:13.422 --> 43:16.025
That is a pipe dream.

43:16.026 --> 43:18.029
That is
a pipe dream, okay?

43:18.030 --> 43:20.033
To get where
Arnold got in life

43:20.034 --> 43:22.438
you have to be willing
to step on a few fingers

43:22.439 --> 43:25.143
and step on a few friends
and fuck a few people over.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.912
You don't get to that
level without that.

43:26.913 --> 43:28.749
In this world you're
either the barracuda

43:28.750 --> 43:31.254
or you're that little minnow
swimming around like this.

43:31.255 --> 43:32.823
And Arnold's
the barracuda.

43:32.824 --> 43:34.927
And we'll all exercise
a little bit together

43:34.928 --> 43:38.100
with the dumbbells. Come on
now, let's do some presses here.

43:38.101 --> 43:40.337
<i>In the same year
that George Bush Sr. signed</i>

43:40.338 --> 43:43.242
<i>the Steroid Control Act he
also made Arnold Schwarzenegger</i>

43:43.243 --> 43:46.114
<i>the chairman of the President's
Council on Physical Fitness.</i>

43:46.115 --> 43:47.984
<i>So I'm confused.</i>

43:47.985 --> 43:50.522
<i>Was the President saying
that a former steroid user</i>

43:50.523 --> 43:52.225
<i>could still be a
role model for kids?</i>

43:52.226 --> 43:53.562
- Are you gonna exercise?
- Yeah!

43:53.563 --> 43:55.131
We're gonna
pump up muscle!

43:55.132 --> 43:57.535
<i>Enter Steve Rogers,</i>

43:57.536 --> 43:59.639
<i>Too puny to be
accepted by the army,</i>

43:59.640 --> 44:02.611
<i>but willing to risk
death for his country.</i>

44:02.612 --> 44:04.882
He's changing
right before our eyes!

44:04.883 --> 44:06.886
<i>Suddenly it is over</i>

44:06.887 --> 44:08.889
<i>and America has
a new champion.</i>

44:08.890 --> 44:11.995
<i>Why do you think in America
superheroes are so important?</i>

44:11.996 --> 44:13.999
<i>People need heroes,</i>

44:14.000 --> 44:16.704
<i>Whether in real life
or in fiction,</i>

44:16.705 --> 44:19.242
because they need somebody
to inspire them,

44:19.243 --> 44:21.212
something to aim for,

44:21.213 --> 44:23.517
somebody to try
to be like.

44:23.518 --> 44:26.755
<i>I think any boy
would want</i>

44:26.756 --> 44:29.126
<i>to be built like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

44:29.127 --> 44:32.399
<i>Did you ever want to be
big a muscular like that?</i>

44:32.400 --> 44:34.770
I wanted to be a little--
when I'd go to the beach

44:34.771 --> 44:37.675
I used to wish that my
arms were a little stronger.

44:37.676 --> 44:40.381
I looked more like
the 98-lb weakling.

44:40.382 --> 44:42.785
<i>Did that ever inspire you,
that Charles Atlas comic strip?</i>

44:42.786 --> 44:45.723
<i>- Did that inspire some of your characters?
- It inspired everybody.</i>

44:45.724 --> 44:47.994
<i>Let me teach
you how to become strong.</i>

44:55.309 --> 44:57.912
When you're young
you get impressions

44:57.913 --> 45:00.718
That pretty much
last you all your life.

45:00.719 --> 45:03.122
If you step up
and show up

45:03.123 --> 45:05.226
and play hard,
you're gonna play.

45:05.227 --> 45:06.929
All right,
get a break.

45:06.930 --> 45:08.932
Rock 'n' roll, fellas!

45:08.933 --> 45:10.669
<i>Smelly's now a coach</i>

45:10.670 --> 45:12.673
<i>for the local high-school
football team.</i>

45:12.674 --> 45:15.445
<i>Kind of like Arnold, he just
wants to give back to the kids.</i>

45:15.446 --> 45:17.782
<i>Going to school
was pretty painful for me.</i>

45:17.783 --> 45:20.554
Oftentimes I can find
the kid who is like me

45:20.555 --> 45:22.558
<i>and maybe doesn't have
the best confidence</i>

45:22.559 --> 45:24.194
<i>and show him
how to lift weights</i>

45:24.195 --> 45:25.796
<i>and build him up
physically and mentally.</i>

45:28.035 --> 45:30.205
<i>He's the kind of guy</i>

45:30.206 --> 45:32.943
who would get in your life
and slowly turn it around.

45:32.944 --> 45:35.281
<i>He keeps me going. He keeps
me motivated about something.</i>

45:35.282 --> 45:37.251
When he works with those
high school kids

45:37.252 --> 45:40.189
<i>that's his passion.
Not a lot of kids</i>

45:40.190 --> 45:42.594
<i>Have a strong male figure
in their life.</i>

45:45.034 --> 45:47.871
<i>I mean, a lot of people--
they're usually very selfish,</i>

45:47.872 --> 45:50.208
but he's not. I've never really
met anyone that's like that.

45:54.183 --> 45:55.785
<i>There's a gym
in Columbus, Ohio,</i>

45:55.786 --> 45:58.189
<i>Where the strongest guys
in the world train.</i>

45:58.190 --> 46:00.360
<i>It's called
West Side Barbell.</i>

46:00.361 --> 46:03.800
<i>And this is where Smelly learned
from his role model, Louie Simmons.</i>

46:03.801 --> 46:06.071
I've got a philosophy like
many-- when you go to war

46:06.072 --> 46:08.976
you go to kill.
You don't go to get killed.

46:08.977 --> 46:10.579
There's nobody
in this place

46:10.580 --> 46:12.549
that's not trying to be the
best athlete in the world.

46:12.550 --> 46:16.690
<i>Everybody here is trying to
achieve an elite level of success.</i>

46:16.691 --> 46:18.761
Pretty much as you're a kid you
always want to be the strongest.

46:18.762 --> 46:20.764
I always wanted to be
the strongest guy.

46:20.765 --> 46:23.202
And I still want
to be that, you know.

46:25.641 --> 46:28.245
<i>In 1959 my
father showed me a book.</i>

46:28.246 --> 46:30.415
It was about the Russians
taking testosterone.

46:30.416 --> 46:32.319
So I said,
"what the hell?

46:32.320 --> 46:35.224
<i>First chance I got, I'm gonna
do some of this." and so I did.</i>

46:35.225 --> 46:38.063
I've actually been on
anabolic steroids for 36 years.

46:38.064 --> 46:40.668
Matt, Matt, Matt,
Matt, Matt, Matt!

46:40.669 --> 46:41.536
Up up up up up!

46:43.941 --> 46:46.412
<i>Is it something I
should be morally battling</i>

46:46.413 --> 46:48.081
<i>or should I be fine
with doing it?</i>

46:48.082 --> 46:50.085
Your morals are
your morals, not mine.

46:50.086 --> 46:53.290
Who am I to judge you? And
who are you to judge me?

46:53.291 --> 46:56.029
<i>You want to be strong
or you want to be weak?</i>

46:56.030 --> 46:57.665
But you can't be strong
without doing steroids?

46:57.666 --> 46:59.268
You can't be
as strong as possible.

46:59.269 --> 47:01.974
<i>If you want to reach the top
you're gonna have to do it.</i>

47:01.975 --> 47:04.845
Everybody thinks anabolic
steroids is the easy way out.

47:04.846 --> 47:07.149
<i>The people that train
with anabolic steroids</i>

47:07.150 --> 47:08.987
<i>train way harder
than people that don't.</i>

47:08.988 --> 47:10.956
<i>Regardless of what people
think of Barry Bonds,</i>

47:10.957 --> 47:13.027
<i>you can't take
a bottle of testosterone,</i>

47:13.028 --> 47:14.663
<i>put on Barry's
baseball uniform</i>

47:14.664 --> 47:16.900
<i>and make him hit
700 home runs.</i>

47:16.901 --> 47:19.806
<i>Barry's got to go out, train
and hit the 700 home runs.</i>

47:19.807 --> 47:21.809
But what if
the scientists came up

47:21.810 --> 47:23.980
with something better
than anabolic steroids?

47:23.981 --> 47:26.818
<i>You see cows, you see
immense, powerful cows,</i>

47:26.819 --> 47:29.557
<i>And they basically have
changed their genes.</i>

47:29.558 --> 47:32.562
<i>If they can change your
genes, would that be illegal?</i>

47:32.563 --> 47:35.267
What would they do then?
Just ban sports in general?

47:35.268 --> 47:37.271
Oh My Lord.

47:40.679 --> 47:44.284
When people see these,
is the first question

47:44.285 --> 47:46.288
<i>"how many hormones
do you pump into them?"</i>

47:46.289 --> 47:48.091
<i>Well, it's two comments.
One would be,</i>

47:48.092 --> 47:50.662
"oh my gosh, what did you
do to that thing?"

47:50.663 --> 47:52.833
And secondly, "it looks
like Arnold Schwarzenegger."

47:52.834 --> 47:54.837
<i>This is a
Belgian Blue Bull--</i>

47:57.409 --> 48:01.482
<i>2600 lbs, all muscle,
all natural.</i>

48:01.483 --> 48:03.986
So tell me again,
you're all natural?

48:03.987 --> 48:05.957
You're not
taking anything?

48:08.830 --> 48:10.799
<i>I think you're ready
for Congress.</i>

48:10.800 --> 48:12.670
<i>He has
a genetic mutation</i>

48:12.671 --> 48:14.940
<i>that allows him to grow
double muscle.</i>

48:14.941 --> 48:16.710
<i>And scientists
have figured out</i>

48:16.711 --> 48:19.014
<i>how to genetically alter
humans the same way.</i>

48:19.015 --> 48:21.352
<i>Dr. Lee Sweeney is
using this technology</i>

48:21.353 --> 48:23.222
<i>to try to cure
muscular dystrophy.</i>

48:23.223 --> 48:25.693
It's obviously going to become
more and more evident

48:25.694 --> 48:27.697
that what we call talent

48:27.698 --> 48:30.435
<i>is really
genetic variation.</i>

48:30.436 --> 48:32.906
<i>There's genetic enhancement
available that might be able</i>

48:32.907 --> 48:35.712
to give you what
nature didn't give you.

48:35.713 --> 48:39.218
<i>Trying to figure out how
to do it in the safest way</i>

48:39.219 --> 48:41.255
<i>Is something that
hasn't been worked out.</i>

48:41.256 --> 48:43.259
<i>If you find out
that it's safe,</i>

48:43.260 --> 48:45.496
<i>would you be somebody
who would say, "hey--"?</i>

48:45.497 --> 48:46.832
Yeah, I would be
first in line.

48:46.833 --> 48:48.334
'Cause it seems
like this is

48:48.335 --> 48:51.140
<i>the future of sports--
gene doping.</i>

48:51.141 --> 48:53.177
Gene doping, yeah.
I wouldn't do it.

48:54.547 --> 48:57.285
<i>Will gene doping ruin
sports in America?</i>

48:57.286 --> 48:59.088
I don't think so.
I mean, I think

48:59.089 --> 49:01.092
<i>any time there's
a new technology</i>

49:01.093 --> 49:03.729
<i>everyone says, "okay,
we have to stand back</i>

49:03.730 --> 49:06.635
<i>and think about what this is
really gonna mean to society."</i>

49:06.636 --> 49:08.305
And I think
that's the debate

49:08.306 --> 49:10.209
we will come to
in the coming decades.

49:10.210 --> 49:13.180
<i>Good sportsmanship--
you know what that means?</i>

49:13.181 --> 49:15.551
<i>Play fair.</i>

49:15.552 --> 49:17.856
<i>When I was a kid
cheating was pretty clear-cut,</i>

49:17.857 --> 49:20.427
<i>like when the million dollar
man hired the referee's</i>

49:20.428 --> 49:22.564
<i>evil twin brother to cheat
the Hulkster out of his title.</i>

49:22.565 --> 49:24.869
<i>Is that Dave
Hebner or is that Dave Hebner?</i>

49:24.870 --> 49:27.870
You know, cheating in other sports
wasn't all that different.

49:28.371 --> 49:29.371
Remember when Joe Necro

49:28.367 --> 49:31.572
<i>was hot-scuffing the ball
with an emery board?</i>

49:31.573 --> 49:33.408
<i>Something
came out of his pocket.</i>

49:33.409 --> 49:35.813
<i>Chris: And what about when the
Patriots were playing the Dolphins</i>

49:35.814 --> 49:38.050
<i>And they hired
an ex-con to clear</i>

49:38.051 --> 49:40.088
<i>a spot in the snow for
the field-goal kicker?</i>

49:40.089 --> 49:42.125
<i>You can't do that.</i>

49:42.126 --> 49:43.861
I think it's
the most unfair thing

49:43.862 --> 49:45.430
that I've ever been
associated in.

49:45.431 --> 49:48.236
<i>Or like when Rosie
Ruiz won the Boston Marathon.</i>

49:48.237 --> 49:51.408
The mystery woman winner. We
missed her at all our checkpoints.

49:51.409 --> 49:54.414
<i>Why take steroids
when you can take a bus?</i>

49:54.415 --> 49:56.083
<i>And who can forget
when Tonya Harding</i>

49:56.084 --> 49:59.590
<i>hired a goon to take out
Nancy Kerrigan's knee?</i>

49:59.591 --> 50:01.594
Why? Why?

50:01.595 --> 50:03.731
<i>I guess if you can't
beat 'em,</i>

50:03.732 --> 50:05.701
<i>beat 'em
with a lead pipe.</i>

50:05.702 --> 50:08.540
<i>But somehow steroids
seem kind of different.</i>

50:08.541 --> 50:11.111
I thought in undergraduate
school and in college

50:11.112 --> 50:12.747
I was a pretty good
athlete.

50:12.748 --> 50:15.520
But I find
myself angry,

50:15.521 --> 50:18.425
angry in my gut

50:18.426 --> 50:22.065
because these are the same guys
that would have taken me out,

50:22.066 --> 50:24.469
taken me out
not because they had

50:24.470 --> 50:27.341
more god-given
natural talent than me

50:27.342 --> 50:31.249
but because they enhanced
with artificial means.

50:31.250 --> 50:33.786
<i>If using
steroids is cheating,</i>

50:33.787 --> 50:36.691
<i>seems like a whole bunch of other
stuff should be cheating too.</i>

50:36.692 --> 50:39.831
<i>Take Tiger Woods, for example.
He had Lasik eye surgery</i>

50:39.832 --> 50:43.204
<i>and now his vision is 20/15.
That's better than perfect.</i>

50:43.205 --> 50:45.808
<i>My eyes are stable.
My game's a lot better.</i>

50:45.809 --> 50:47.646
I felt pretty good
coming in.

50:47.647 --> 50:49.815
<i>In a game that relies
so much on depth perception,</i>

50:49.816 --> 50:53.455
<i>wouldn't superhuman vision
be a performance enhancement?</i>

50:53.456 --> 50:55.226
<i>Then there's
cortisone shots.</i>

50:55.227 --> 50:57.497
<i>They helped Curt Schilling
win the World Series.</i>

50:57.498 --> 50:59.533
<i>And those are
steroids too.</i>

50:59.534 --> 51:03.574
<i>Truth is, corticosteroids can have worse
side effects than anabolic steroids,</i>

51:03.575 --> 51:05.912
but they're used
in sports every day.

51:05.913 --> 51:07.815
He had a 20-minute
cortisone shot

51:07.816 --> 51:10.421
after Monday's match after
his back tightened up.

51:10.422 --> 51:12.357
<i>Here's an even
more confusing example--</i>

51:12.358 --> 51:14.027
<i>Floyd Landis claims</i>

51:14.028 --> 51:16.197
<i>that he did not take steroids
to win the Tour De France.</i>

51:16.198 --> 51:18.435
<i>Truth is, I
didn't use testosterone</i>

51:18.436 --> 51:20.272
like I'm accused of doing.
I didn't cheat.

51:20.273 --> 51:22.476
I didn't do anything
outside of the rules.

51:22.477 --> 51:25.849
I won the Tour clean
and I deserved to win.

51:25.850 --> 51:27.418
I'm proud of it
and I always will be.

51:27.419 --> 51:30.523
<i>But he did sleep in
his own altitude chamber.</i>

51:30.524 --> 51:32.527
I got my
altitude chamber

51:32.528 --> 51:34.632
out by the garage
these days.

51:34.633 --> 51:37.003
So you made this?

51:37.004 --> 51:38.905
Yeah, it's not actually
that hard to make.

51:38.907 --> 51:41.478
I didn't make the pipe. I got the
pipe from some construction site.

51:41.479 --> 51:43.014
They were putting in
a water main.

51:43.015 --> 51:44.650
Is the result
pretty good?

51:44.651 --> 51:45.985
For me it makes
a difference, yeah.

51:45.986 --> 51:48.023
And how long do you
stay in here for?

51:48.024 --> 51:50.828
Just sleep in there all night.
I don't know, six or seven hours.

51:50.829 --> 51:52.831
Is your wife like,
"what are you doing?"

51:52.832 --> 51:54.835
"I'm gonna sleep
in the chamber."

51:54.836 --> 51:56.305
She hates it.

51:56.306 --> 51:57.974
So you just climb
in there?

51:57.975 --> 51:59.511
Yeah, you want
to try it out?

51:59.512 --> 52:01.748
You won't have a monitor
in there, but I have it set

52:01.749 --> 52:03.051
to, like,
about 13,000'.

52:06.057 --> 52:08.360
<i>See, sleeping
in an altitude chamber</i>

52:08.361 --> 52:10.364
<i>produces a lot more
red blood cells,</i>

52:10.365 --> 52:12.368
<i>which means more oxygen
in your system,</i>

52:12.369 --> 52:15.807
<i>which means more endurance for a
cyclist or a long-distance runner.</i>

52:15.808 --> 52:18.679
<i>There are four ways to increase
your red blood cell count.</i>

52:18.680 --> 52:22.019
<i>You can sleep in an
altitude chamber like Floyd</i>

52:22.020 --> 52:24.757
<i>or you can just train at the
U.S. Olympic training center</i>

52:24.758 --> 52:26.794
<i>at 6,000'
in Colorado.</i>

52:26.795 --> 52:28.664
<i>Then there's
blood doping.</i>

52:28.665 --> 52:31.202
<i>That's when you draw your own
blood a month before the big race,</i>

52:31.203 --> 52:33.339
<i>then re-inject it
the night before.</i>

52:33.340 --> 52:35.744
<i>Finally, there's a drug
called E.P.O.</i>

52:35.745 --> 52:37.614
<i>which simply
tells your body</i>

52:37.615 --> 52:39.484
<i>to produce more
red blood cells.</i>

52:39.485 --> 52:41.821
<i>So that's four ways to
do the exact same thing,</i>

52:41.822 --> 52:45.495
<i>but two are allowed
and two are cheating.</i>

52:45.496 --> 52:47.766
You done yet?

52:51.273 --> 52:54.245
Hey.
That's kind of weird.

52:54.246 --> 52:56.816
No, it's nice, man. Once you get used
to it it's nice sleeping in there.

52:56.817 --> 52:58.920
<i>What's heartbreaking
is my eight-year-old--</i>

52:58.921 --> 53:00.856
<i>his two favorite athletes are
Barry Bonds and Lance Armstrong.</i>

53:00.857 --> 53:03.227
My four-year-old is obsessed
with Floyd Landis.

53:03.228 --> 53:05.365
<i>So what do you tell these kids?
I talk to people all the time</i>

53:05.366 --> 53:07.335
<i>That they go, "who can
my kids believe in?"</i>

53:07.336 --> 53:09.505
And I want to tell them
is "nobody."

53:09.506 --> 53:11.743
I ask not to be judged
and much less

53:11.744 --> 53:13.680
to be sentenced
by anyone.

53:13.681 --> 53:16.853
<i>You can't trust anybody now because
the testing is so ineffective.</i>

53:16.854 --> 53:19.257
You don't know who's really
clean, who's really dirty.

53:19.258 --> 53:22.196
<i>Were you taking any
sort of drugs for that race?</i>

53:22.197 --> 53:24.200
Not what they
fined me with, no.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.270
<i>- But you were taking other stuff.
- Other stuff, yeah.</i>

53:26.271 --> 53:27.940
<i>But isn't that
still cheating?</i>

53:27.941 --> 53:30.644
Still cheating, yeah,
like everybody else.

53:30.645 --> 53:32.315
<i>So that's how
you justify it--</i>

53:32.316 --> 53:33.917
<i>- Everybody's cheating?
- Yes.</i>

53:33.918 --> 53:35.821
When I interviewed Ben
Johnson he basically said,

53:35.822 --> 53:37.524
"look, everybody was
on something."

53:37.525 --> 53:41.966
Well, you know, Ben--
and bless his heart,

53:41.967 --> 53:44.035
he's got to say
everyone was on something.

53:44.036 --> 53:47.041
That's justifying
his own means.

53:47.042 --> 53:48.644
So he has a problem
with you beating--

53:48.645 --> 53:50.314
he has a problem--
he has a problem

53:50.315 --> 53:52.752
- of, you know, me beating him.
- Yeah.

53:52.753 --> 53:54.755
When we were taking
that victory stand,

53:54.756 --> 53:56.859
we were on the stand
and he got the gold medal,

53:56.860 --> 53:59.164
<i>he didn't smile.
He never smiled.</i>

53:59.165 --> 54:00.901
<i>He never celebrated.
And the thing is,</i>

54:00.902 --> 54:04.139
he couldn't really inside share
in the joy of winning. He cheated.

54:04.140 --> 54:06.143
You cheat.
Everybody cheats.

54:06.144 --> 54:07.813
Nobody in this world
is perfect.

54:07.814 --> 54:09.483
Nobody in this life
is perfect-- nobody.

54:09.484 --> 54:13.090
They know that in 1988
six Americans at least

54:13.091 --> 54:15.094
tested positive in Seoul.
And they all shut up

54:15.095 --> 54:17.531
<i>because the biggest money
comes from America.</i>

54:17.532 --> 54:19.534
So who's gonna
get shafted,

54:19.535 --> 54:21.538
Americans
or Ben Johnson?

54:21.539 --> 54:24.510
<i>I think that Ben
Johnson was unfairly singled out.</i>

54:24.511 --> 54:27.382
<i>I think that there's
always scapegoats.</i>

54:27.383 --> 54:30.655
<i>Is there a lot of drug use
going on in Olympics?</i>

54:30.656 --> 54:33.794
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

54:33.795 --> 54:36.398
<i>Dr. Exum was the
Director of Anti-Doping</i>

54:36.399 --> 54:38.603
<i>at the U.S. Olympic Committee
for 10 years.</i>

54:38.604 --> 54:41.308
<i>He thought his job was
to stop drugs in sports,</i>

54:41.309 --> 54:43.813
<i>but his bosses had
other priorities.</i>

54:43.814 --> 54:46.551
<i>He told me that over
2000 American athletes</i>

54:46.552 --> 54:49.122
<i>failed their drug tests,
including Carl Lewis,</i>

54:49.123 --> 54:50.959
<i>and they were
covered up.</i>

54:50.960 --> 54:53.029
<i>Nobody believes Carl Lewis
ever failed a drug test.</i>

54:53.030 --> 54:54.866
<i>- Do you have any proof?
- Oh, certainly.</i>

54:54.867 --> 54:58.439
We have just boxes of proof
for everything that I say.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.443
There it is,
book three.

55:00.444 --> 55:03.649
Here's a letter from
then Executive Director

55:03.650 --> 55:06.388
<i>Baaron Pittenger
to Mr. Lewis.</i>

55:06.389 --> 55:09.426
<i>"I must confirm that the
analysis for your specimen 'B'</i>

55:09.427 --> 55:12.332
<i>was positive for
pseudoephedrine, ephedrine,</i>

55:12.333 --> 55:14.770
And phenylpropanolee--
lamine--

55:14.771 --> 55:16.873
- Is that what is is?
- Phenylpropanolamine, yeah.

55:16.874 --> 55:18.643
<i>--IOC banned stimulants.</i>

55:18.644 --> 55:21.648
<i>By policy of the U.S.O.C.,

55:21.649 --> 55:24.019
<i>for disqualification

<i>to the 1988 Summer Olympic
Games in Seoul, Korea."</i>

55:27.126 --> 55:29.563
<i>Wow.</i>

55:29.564 --> 55:31.467
This is basically
a letter that said

55:31.468 --> 55:32.903
that you had failed
the test

55:32.904 --> 55:35.708
and that there was a
consequence to that failure.

55:35.709 --> 55:38.881
As we all know,
that didn't come about.

55:38.882 --> 55:41.485
You actually received
a letter, or a call--

55:41.486 --> 55:43.489
- Yes. - --that you had
failed the drug test--

55:43.490 --> 55:45.592
- Right. - --because
of some stimulants?

55:45.593 --> 55:46.896
Yeah, it was like

55:46.897 --> 55:48.999
a cold medicine type thing,
the herbal supplement.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.603
They made up this term. It
was called "inadvertent use"--

55:51.604 --> 55:54.843
<i>an athlete took something
without meaning to take it</i>

55:54.844 --> 55:58.316
or without meaning to gain
an advantage from taking it.

55:58.317 --> 56:00.353
<i>Mm-hmm.
And so they made that up</i>

56:00.354 --> 56:02.190
<i>to basically kind of
let people off the hook?</i>

56:02.191 --> 56:04.160
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

56:04.161 --> 56:07.065
Carl's story is--
it's been a cold medicine;

56:07.066 --> 56:09.571
<i>it's been a tea; it's been
some kind of a nutrient.</i>

56:09.572 --> 56:12.075
<i>- It's a stimulant. - CHRIS: So
you're saying these athletes--</i>

56:12.076 --> 56:14.513
<i>- they know what's on the banned substance list?
- They totally know.</i>

56:14.514 --> 56:16.851
They are bombarded with
the banned substance list.

56:16.852 --> 56:18.854
A lot of people say
you failed the drug test,

56:18.855 --> 56:20.858
you raced against
Ben Johnson,

56:20.859 --> 56:24.331
and that maybe--
maybe the gold medal

56:24.332 --> 56:26.335
- should go to the guy next on the stand.
- I understand.

56:26.336 --> 56:29.240
There are a lot of people that are
going to go to their graves saying,

56:29.241 --> 56:31.344
"I know he did it." and you
know what? To hell with them.

56:34.016 --> 56:36.753
<i>You really cannot
fault the athlete for doing that.</i>

56:36.754 --> 56:40.293
You can't fault Carl
when Carl's belief is

56:40.294 --> 56:43.432
that the system sets some rules
and that you need to follow them.

56:43.433 --> 56:45.436
<i>And they made an
exception in his case.</i>

56:45.437 --> 56:48.575
<i>They made an exception in
a lot of people's cases.</i>

56:48.576 --> 56:50.746
<i>But it's the system</i>

56:50.747 --> 56:53.384
<i>that actually teaches
athletes to think that way.</i>

56:53.385 --> 56:55.388
<i>You know, for me</i>

56:55.389 --> 56:57.725
<i>the whole "level playing
field" was a myth.</i>

56:57.726 --> 57:01.065
If we could not do anything
to take doping out of sports

57:01.066 --> 57:04.505
then doping was
meant to be in sports.

57:04.506 --> 57:08.211
The first all-drug Olympics
opened today in Bogota, Colombia.

57:08.212 --> 57:11.150
Athletes are allowed to
take any substance whatsoever

57:11.151 --> 57:13.721
before, after, and even
during the competition.

57:17.429 --> 57:19.732
Oh! He's pulled
his arms off!

57:19.733 --> 57:22.638
He's pulled his arms off. That's got
to be disappointing to the big Russian.

57:26.212 --> 57:28.215
Yeah!

57:28.216 --> 57:31.387
What has made
every major sport

57:31.388 --> 57:33.324
<i>a multi-billion-dollar
entity?</i>

57:33.325 --> 57:35.729
<i>Well, after you
distill it all down,</i>

57:35.730 --> 57:37.298
<i>it's the desire
of the customer,</i>

57:37.299 --> 57:40.537
<i>the fans that fill
these seats and others,</i>

57:40.538 --> 57:44.111
<i>to see bigger-than-life people
doing bigger-than-life things.</i>

57:44.112 --> 57:46.749
<i>What do you think about
athletes using steroids in sports?</i>

57:46.750 --> 57:48.920
Steroids?
I love it if they're on my team.

57:48.921 --> 57:51.157
I think it's totally wrong,
totally wrong.

57:51.158 --> 57:52.793
<i>- Worst offense. Throw them out.
- It's cheating?</i>

57:52.794 --> 57:54.664
Hell yeah, it's cheating.
Are you kidding me?

57:56.601 --> 57:59.205
Oh!

58:01.611 --> 58:03.446
<i>It all gets back to money.</i>

58:03.447 --> 58:05.216
<i>As long as people
continue to buy</i>

58:05.217 --> 58:08.255
Mark McGuire shirts,
Barry Bonds hats,

58:08.256 --> 58:10.659
<i>we're feeding
that monster.</i>

58:10.660 --> 58:13.164
You vote for the Raiders
by wearing the Raiders hat.

58:13.165 --> 58:14.934
<i>You cast your vote for
Nike with your T-shirt.</i>

58:14.935 --> 58:17.505
You know, every day when you
pick a dollar out of your pocket

58:17.506 --> 58:19.676
you're voting.
And if you don't like

58:19.677 --> 58:23.015
athletes juicing up, then
don't vote to have that done.

58:23.016 --> 58:25.186
Don't buy their stuff.
Don't go to the game.

58:25.187 --> 58:27.190
Do steroids.
Become governor.

58:27.191 --> 58:29.361
Be big and strong,
no girly man.

58:29.362 --> 58:31.732
- The Giants, baby!
- Whoo!

58:31.733 --> 58:34.269
Shockey!

58:34.270 --> 58:36.006
Whoo!

58:36.007 --> 58:37.776
<i>Since the
steroid scandals broke</i>

58:37.777 --> 58:39.847
<i>sports revenue has gone
through the roof.</i>

58:39.848 --> 58:43.320
<i>People are buying more tickets,
T-shirts as souvenirs than ever.</i>

58:43.321 --> 58:45.791
<i>So if this is what we
the people are voting for,</i>

58:45.792 --> 58:48.362
<i>why did Congress
get involved?</i>

58:48.363 --> 58:50.600
<i>They always tell you that
if you have a problem,</i>

58:50.601 --> 58:52.603
<i>Talk to your
Congressman.</i>

58:52.604 --> 58:55.642
<i>Lucky for me, my
Congressman is Henry Waxman.</i>

58:55.643 --> 58:57.445
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

58:57.446 --> 58:58.982
Very nice to meet you.
Chris Bell.

58:58.983 --> 59:00.351
<i>He's the one who called</i>

59:00.352 --> 59:02.354
<i>the baseball hearings
in the first place.</i>

59:02.355 --> 59:04.358
<i>He's got to have
some answers.</i>

59:04.359 --> 59:06.362
I think it's important

59:06.363 --> 59:09.133
for sports figures

59:09.134 --> 59:11.571
in major league sports

59:11.572 --> 59:13.575
not to be allowed

59:13.576 --> 59:16.647
to use steroids
under any circumstance.

59:16.648 --> 59:18.517
And for young people--

59:18.518 --> 59:21.155
we certainly don't want
them to be using it.

59:21.156 --> 59:24.428
So the drug is
a restricted drug.

59:24.429 --> 59:27.033
It's not--
there's not a--

59:27.034 --> 59:29.738
Let me--

59:29.739 --> 59:32.075
Brian, is it illegal
to use--?

59:32.076 --> 59:33.946
it's illegal--
it's legal

59:33.947 --> 59:35.615
under some circumstances.
What's--?

59:35.616 --> 59:37.352
<i>It's legal
with a prescription--</i>

59:37.353 --> 59:39.623
<i>- legal with-- okay.
- --A medical prescription.</i>

59:39.624 --> 59:41.493
It's legal with
a medical prescription.

59:41.494 --> 59:43.397
And the other drug
was the...

59:43.398 --> 59:45.567
testosterone or just
steroids in general.

59:45.568 --> 59:47.938
Well, I think that
they're also banned.

59:47.939 --> 59:50.543
They're already banned
in professional sports.

59:50.544 --> 59:52.814
Brian, am I right?
Speak up if I'm wrong.

59:52.815 --> 59:53.983
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

59:53.984 --> 59:56.254
Well, these products
are already banned.

59:56.255 --> 59:59.359
Cigarettes
and alcohol

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.363
are legally
available,

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.168
but not if you're
under the age.

01:00:04.169 --> 01:00:06.172
And I think the age

01:00:06.173 --> 01:00:08.943
is 18 for both
all around the country.

01:00:08.944 --> 01:00:12.116
Is it 18 or 21? I'm
getting confused. What?

01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:13.618
<i>21.
21.</i>

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:15.556
- Okay, so strike that.
- That's all right.

01:00:15.557 --> 01:00:17.593
<i>President Bush allotted</i>

01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:20.031
<i>$15 million
for steroid education.</i>

01:00:20.032 --> 01:00:21.967
<i>Where has
that money gone?</i>

01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:24.706
Um, I don't know.

01:00:24.707 --> 01:00:27.177
Do you know?

01:00:27.178 --> 01:00:28.680
Okay, we don't know.

01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:31.518
<i>- Okay.
- So...</i>

01:00:31.519 --> 01:00:33.522
It's a war on drugs

01:00:33.523 --> 01:00:35.559
and Congressmen want
to be tough on drugs,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.562
so they just
demonize them all.

01:00:37.563 --> 01:00:39.700
And they say, "oh, our children
are being exposed to them.

01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:41.704
They're gonna kill
our children."

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:44.142
And they just paint
everything in black and white.

01:00:44.143 --> 01:00:46.413
And they really don't
see the areas in between.

01:00:46.414 --> 01:00:48.617
For those of us
who live in the grey areas

01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:50.453
and whose life
depends on it.

01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:52.055
It's a very
important issue.

01:00:52.056 --> 01:00:54.260
Politicians
are always looking

01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:56.297
for an issue
to get behind.

01:00:56.298 --> 01:00:58.134
They're always looking
for something

01:00:58.135 --> 01:00:59.970
to be able to say
to the public,

01:00:59.971 --> 01:01:01.841
"hey, look at what
my legislation's doing.

01:01:01.842 --> 01:01:03.210
Look at what
my bill has done.

01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:06.081
I'm out there.
I'm protecting you.

01:01:06.082 --> 01:01:08.152
I'm protecting
the children."

01:01:08.153 --> 01:01:10.256
<i>Turns out the
most important witness</i>

01:01:10.257 --> 01:01:13.095
<i>at the baseball hearings
was not a famous athlete.</i>

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:15.566
<i>Taylor Hooton was
a 17-year-old kid</i>

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:19.005
<i>who committed suicide and
his father blamed steroids.</i>

01:01:19.006 --> 01:01:21.911
I believe
the poor example

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:24.249
being set
by professional athletes

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.720
is a major catalyst
fueling

01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:29.091
the high usage of steroids
amongst our kids.

01:01:29.092 --> 01:01:31.328
And parents
across America

01:01:31.329 --> 01:01:33.665
should hold you
accountable

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:36.070
for behavior
that inspires our kids

01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:38.474
to do things that put
their health at risk

01:01:38.475 --> 01:01:40.478
and that teaches them
that the ethics

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:42.983
we try to teach them
around our kitchen table

01:01:42.984 --> 01:01:45.454
somehow don't apply
to them.

01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:47.458
Please help us to see

01:01:47.459 --> 01:01:50.129
that our children's lives
were not lost in vain.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.868
You have the power
to do something about it

01:01:52.869 --> 01:01:55.706
and we're counting
on you to do so.

01:01:55.707 --> 01:01:57.442
<i>Donald Hooton coming in</i>

01:01:57.443 --> 01:01:59.180
<i>and putting
a human face on it</i>

01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:02.653
was more powerful
than the scientific--

01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:04.957
the statistics
or any of that stuff.

01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:07.628
<i>On average,
5,000 kids a year</i>

01:02:07.629 --> 01:02:09.666
<i>commit suicide
in America.</i>

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:12.337
<i>And most parents
never know exactly why.</i>

01:02:12.338 --> 01:02:14.675
<i>I wanted to find out why
Donald Hooton is so sure</i>

01:02:14.676 --> 01:02:17.279
<i>that the answer could
be as simple as steroids.</i>

01:02:25.229 --> 01:02:26.730
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:28.834
- Chris Henry.
- Don Hooton. Nice to meet you.

01:02:28.835 --> 01:02:32.139
This is a very very
competitive community

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.612
all the way from
athletics to business.

01:02:34.613 --> 01:02:37.850
So you wind up
in an affluent area

01:02:37.851 --> 01:02:41.156
where these kids can afford
to play with this stuff.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.494
<i>And of course in
hindsight as we look back,</i>

01:02:43.495 --> 01:02:45.598
<i>all of the signs were
staring us in the face--</i>

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:48.170
The behavior problems,
the physical changes,

01:02:48.171 --> 01:02:50.440
but we had no idea
what we were looking at.

01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:52.410
If we go back
to the medical textbook,

01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:55.316
the depression that comes
along with steroid use is bad,

01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:58.656
<i>but it's worse in that
four-to-six-week period</i>

01:02:58.657 --> 01:03:01.160
<i>following stopping
using this stuff.</i>

01:03:01.161 --> 01:03:03.431
<i>And it was
during that period</i>

01:03:03.432 --> 01:03:05.434
that his mother
found him

01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:07.939
hanging on the door
in his bedroom.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.275
<i>Jeez.</i>

01:03:09.276 --> 01:03:11.278
Taylor Hooton's dad,
Don Hooton,

01:03:11.279 --> 01:03:14.484
called me shortly after

01:03:14.485 --> 01:03:17.056
Taylor had taken
his life.

01:03:17.057 --> 01:03:19.760
Together we came up
with the idea

01:03:19.761 --> 01:03:21.865
of creating
a private organization...

01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.835
...to educate
the public

01:03:23.836 --> 01:03:25.838
<i>about the dangers</i>

01:03:25.839 --> 01:03:28.142
<i>of anabolic steroid abuse.</i>

01:03:28.143 --> 01:03:30.013
This is Taylor's room.

01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:31.850
You don't have to come
in here long to realize

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:33.519
Taylor was
a baseball player.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.560
<i>'Cause he started maybe
five years old in T-ball.</i>

01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:41.601
<i>But Taylor was
a great kid.</i>

01:03:41.602 --> 01:03:43.872
We took Taylor
to a psychiatrist

01:03:43.873 --> 01:03:46.810
<i>and she put him on
a low dose of Lexapro.</i>

01:03:46.811 --> 01:03:49.282
<i>And as far as I know,</i>

01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:51.920
this is the only
steroid-related case

01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:55.694
that this well-meaning
psychiatrist had ever had.

01:03:55.695 --> 01:03:59.367
And when the psychiatrist
recommended that Taylor go cold turkey

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.705
and stop using steroids...

01:04:03.742 --> 01:04:05.912
it was a formula
for disaster.

01:04:05.913 --> 01:04:08.250
I feel terrible, obviously,
about Taylor Hooton,

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.621
But Taylor Hooton had
a lot of problems

01:04:10.622 --> 01:04:12.625
and he was on other drugs.

01:04:12.626 --> 01:04:14.628
According to some
newspaper accounts,

01:04:14.629 --> 01:04:17.233
he was on S.S.R.I.S--
antidepressants

01:04:17.234 --> 01:04:19.236
which have been shown
to be associated

01:04:19.237 --> 01:04:22.142
with suicidal ideation
and suicidal behavior.

01:04:22.143 --> 01:04:25.047
<i>So whether his suicide
was due to Lexapro</i>

01:04:25.048 --> 01:04:27.185
<i>or due to steroids
or due to depression</i>

01:04:27.186 --> 01:04:29.522
<i>or due to stress
of being a great athlete,</i>

01:04:29.523 --> 01:04:31.693
<i>there are five other
things-- I don't know.</i>

01:04:31.694 --> 01:04:33.831
Do you think
that perhaps--

01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:36.636
when I look
at your website,

01:04:36.637 --> 01:04:39.440
The Taylor Hooton
Foundation--

01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:41.845
do you think
it's a responsibility

01:04:41.846 --> 01:04:45.652
to include
antidepressants in there

01:04:45.653 --> 01:04:47.656
just in case
there are critics

01:04:47.657 --> 01:04:49.660
or just to raise
the awareness

01:04:49.661 --> 01:04:52.398
of how dangerous perhaps
antidepressants may be?

01:04:52.399 --> 01:04:54.402
No, I don't.
And the reason is,

01:04:54.403 --> 01:04:57.540
our battle is not with antidepressants.
Our battle's with steroids.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:00.479
<i>The National Institute
on Drug Abuse said</i>

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.483
the dangers
of anabolic steroids

01:05:02.484 --> 01:05:04.955
are temporary
and reversible.

01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:06.958
My son is dead.

01:05:09.263 --> 01:05:12.802
All of the intellectual
arguments

01:05:12.803 --> 01:05:14.271
about whether or not

01:05:14.272 --> 01:05:17.844
steroids are dangerous
or not

01:05:17.845 --> 01:05:19.848
don't matter to me.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.785
I know
they're dangerous.

01:05:21.786 --> 01:05:25.092
<i>I saw it with my own eyes
and I watched my son die.</i>

01:05:25.093 --> 01:05:27.763
The only evidence I need
is the pictures of my son

01:05:27.764 --> 01:05:29.766
that are on the wall
behind you.

01:05:29.767 --> 01:05:30.668
Mm-hmm.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:35.510
Look, I have a son too.

01:05:35.511 --> 01:05:38.182
And the last thing in the
world I could ever imagine doing

01:05:38.183 --> 01:05:40.119
is burying that kid.
And it would probably

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.889
ruin me for the rest
of my life.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.059
And I can see
where having a cause

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.798
to sort of assuage
the feelings of guilt

01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:49.870
and depression that are
following my son's death

01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:53.043
would probably be helpful. "Let's
not let this happen to somebody else."

01:05:53.044 --> 01:05:55.514
But they're chasing
the wrong thing.

01:05:55.515 --> 01:05:57.083
They're not
doing it right.

01:05:57.084 --> 01:05:59.087
We're working
with major league baseball

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.091
to make that happen now

01:06:01.092 --> 01:06:03.662
where hopefully
in each local stadium

01:06:03.663 --> 01:06:06.100
<i>there's gonna be
a steroid awareness night.</i>

01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:08.104
Do you find it
ironic at all

01:06:08.105 --> 01:06:11.142
to have a steroid
awareness night for baseball

01:06:11.143 --> 01:06:13.113
in a stadium
that sells alcohol

01:06:13.114 --> 01:06:15.484
which is responsible for
a lot of deaths as a drug?

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.624
Alcohol's legal to sell.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:21.628
<i>And we can argue
all day long</i>

01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:25.702
<i>Whether tobacco kills
and whether alcohol kills,</i>

01:06:25.703 --> 01:06:27.706
and there's a clear
distinction in my mind

01:06:27.707 --> 01:06:30.478
between tobacco
or alcohol

01:06:30.479 --> 01:06:33.884
and steroids and
methamphetamines and coke.

01:06:33.885 --> 01:06:35.654
- Thanks for sharing that with us.
- All right.

01:06:35.655 --> 01:06:37.557
I know how hard
it can be and everything.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:38.659
This is
important stuff.

01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:56.492
<i>Anybody who
asks me about it--</i>

01:06:56.493 --> 01:06:58.329
<i>I let them know.
I tell them why.</i>

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.234
<i>I tell them how much I
take. I'll tell them anything</i>

01:07:01.235 --> 01:07:04.240
<i>- they want to ask me about them
'cause I think-- - What about the kids?</i>

01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:07.079
The kids are different
because--

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.716
<i>a couple kids asked me in
front of the whole group</i>

01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:11.320
<i>and I had to lie
about it</i>

01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:13.825
because this whole steroid
thing is just out of hand.

01:07:13.826 --> 01:07:15.929
I know coach Henry
doesn't take any steroids.

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:18.032
He's just 100% strong.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:20.570
<i>I think somebody asked
him if he was on steroids</i>

01:07:20.571 --> 01:07:23.309
and he said no. And I
completely believe him.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.412
He just teaches that
steroids are basically--

01:07:25.413 --> 01:07:27.249
they're a cheap way
out of doing hard work.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.620
<i>I say they're not for kids.</i>

01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:32.592
<i>Steroids are not for kids.
That's plain and simple.</i>

01:07:32.593 --> 01:07:34.696
<i>You should achieve
things naturally</i>

01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:36.666
<i>and then maybe you
should think about them</i>

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:38.269
<i>when you're
an adult.</i>

01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:40.273
The main reason why
I don't take steroids

01:07:40.274 --> 01:07:42.778
is 'cause he got it into my
head that I don't need 'em,

01:07:42.779 --> 01:07:46.184
that I got the potential right now as
a teenager to get as strong as I want.

01:07:46.185 --> 01:07:48.822
<i>What good would it do them
to know that I take steroids?</i>

01:07:48.823 --> 01:07:51.226
<i>It wouldn't do them any
good. They'd just be like,</i>

01:07:51.227 --> 01:07:53.597
<i>"oh, man,
he's a cheater.</i>

01:07:53.598 --> 01:07:55.468
<i>Would you ever tell our
parents that you do it?</i>

01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:59.041
Um, I mean, you know,

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:01.044
if they asked me.

01:08:01.045 --> 01:08:03.983
I only cooked
two pounds.

01:08:03.984 --> 01:08:06.688
I hope it's enough.

01:08:06.689 --> 01:08:09.026
<i>You know, we went
to church all the time.</i>

01:08:09.027 --> 01:08:10.930
I grew up
in a great family.

01:08:10.931 --> 01:08:12.933
I don't think
I could ask

01:08:12.934 --> 01:08:15.337
for anybody better
to be parents, you know.

01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:19.879
And when I went
to the U.S.C.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.950
<i>I didn't do any drugs.
I didn't do anything.</i>

01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:24.254
<i>- 'Cause you're a good boy.
- Well...</i>

01:08:24.255 --> 01:08:26.792
And then I got to a point
where I actually tried steroids.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.430
<i>I tried Winstrol,
which is injections.</i>

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.667
You injected a needle
in yourself?

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:33.237
<i>It's just
in the muscle.</i>

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:34.939
Yeah, 'cause you get to
a point where you're like,

01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:37.145
"I'm getting out of shape.
I don't feel like I used to."

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:39.148
<i>The reason I stopped
doing it was</i>

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.519
<i>because I thought
it was immoral.</i>

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.990
<i>I thought it was so wrong
and like,</i>

01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:46.194
"what if my parents
found out I did this?"

01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:48.031
I think it's really
hard to hear

01:08:48.032 --> 01:08:51.170
- that you tried 'em and everything, but--
- For you.

01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:52.640
It's not hard
for me.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.877
What I'm saying is
that it's hard to hear.

01:08:55.879 --> 01:08:57.881
And what about mark?
I mean,

01:08:57.883 --> 01:09:00.453
how come you're staying big
but you're not getting fat?

01:09:00.453 --> 01:09:02.925
- You're just--
- I'm getting fatter.

01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:04.862
No, but your face
is rounder.

01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:07.033
- I put on body fat.
He's about--

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:09.804
<i>You're about 7% or 8% higher than what
you normally are, wouldn't you say?</i>

01:09:09.805 --> 01:09:11.506
I have no idea. I don't
really care either.

01:09:11.508 --> 01:09:13.176
<i>He's already
married. He doesn't care.</i>

01:09:13.178 --> 01:09:15.448
Except Smelly's
not saying anything.

01:09:15.448 --> 01:09:18.086
Don't let your brothers
overrun your conversation.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.661
When you get
caught with something

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:26.001
I think the truth is
always the fastest way

01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:27.703
out of the situation,

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.908
but it's not always
the best way out.

01:09:29.908 --> 01:09:32.145
You know, she's concerned.
She's being a mom

01:09:32.145 --> 01:09:36.520
and she's just trying
to leave it open

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.857
where I could say, "Yeah,
you know what? I do 'em.

01:09:38.858 --> 01:09:42.029
And this is why." I think
that's what she's looking for.

01:09:42.031 --> 01:09:44.568
But she's still
never directly asked me.

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.607
So until that time comes
I ain't sayin' nothin'.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:52.182
<i>People have a
tendency to cheat at everything.</i>

01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:54.185
<i>And that happens
with taxes too,</i>

01:09:54.185 --> 01:09:57.025
just like it could with
steroids or any other thing.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:01.632
It's human nature.
It's the sinful nature of men.

01:10:01.634 --> 01:10:03.403
<i>My dad convinced
mad dog and his wife</i>

01:10:03.404 --> 01:10:05.540
<i>To settle down
in Poughkeepsie.</i>

01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:08.312
<i>And he's been doing income taxes for
the same guys he used to wrestle with.</i>

01:10:08.313 --> 01:10:10.783
I keep a couple things
around, not too much.

01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:12.753
Big john.
John always keeps it real.

01:10:12.754 --> 01:10:15.658
This just says "To Mad
Dog. Thanks for everything."

01:10:15.659 --> 01:10:18.931
<i>Not exactly how he
thought his life would turn out.</i>

01:10:18.932 --> 01:10:20.667
<i>I get up, I go to the office,</i>

01:10:20.668 --> 01:10:22.805
you know, I make money for
them, I make money for me.

01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:25.309
<i>I got a great wife.
I got a great family.</i>

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:27.313
But I wanted to be
a famous wrestler

01:10:27.314 --> 01:10:29.718
and, you know,
I wanted to live the life.

01:10:29.719 --> 01:10:32.289
I wanted to be on the road,
travel, meeting people,

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.293
Making money,
having fun--

01:10:34.294 --> 01:10:36.162
you know,
living the life.

01:10:36.163 --> 01:10:38.100
<i>He'll break
down and he'll be crying</i>

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.070
<i>and he'll say, like,
"dad, the biggest fear</i>

01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:42.073
<i>I ever had in my life
was being average Joe.</i>

01:10:42.074 --> 01:10:44.444
<i>And I'm 36 years old and that's
all I can see for myself."</i>

01:10:44.445 --> 01:10:45.814
<i>What do you want to do now?</i>

01:10:45.815 --> 01:10:48.252
<i>Where do you see
yourself going?</i>

01:10:48.253 --> 01:10:51.992
I mean, you know, the immediate
goal was to get out of Poughkeepsie,

01:10:51.993 --> 01:10:55.231
move to California,
establish my name

01:10:55.232 --> 01:10:59.372
and then start my own
business eventually.

01:10:59.373 --> 01:11:01.743
Seemed like he was making
good progress, okay?

01:11:01.744 --> 01:11:03.279
But he wasn't making
any progress.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.950
<i>I told him the other night, I said,</i>

01:11:04.951 --> 01:11:07.321
"you might be fooling
everybody else,

01:11:07.322 --> 01:11:09.023
but you're not
fooling me.

01:11:09.024 --> 01:11:11.194
You're full of shit.
You're still on stuff."

01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:13.365
Why do you think he
would tell us about it?

01:11:13.366 --> 01:11:16.036
He tells me everything else,
you know, that he's doing.

01:11:16.037 --> 01:11:18.040
<i>I think he's
partially embarrassed</i>

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:21.145
and I think he's--

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.483
that's part of
addictive behavior.

01:11:23.484 --> 01:11:26.856
<i>His thing is this-- "I'm gonna be
fine as soon as I'm out of here.</i>

01:11:26.857 --> 01:11:29.794
<i>I'm gonna go live in California.
My life is gonna be perfect."</i>

01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:33.368
<i>But if he really believes that--
no, he's not gonna be fine at all.</i>

01:11:33.369 --> 01:11:36.107
You know who I feel bad
for? I feel bad for Nadine.

01:11:36.108 --> 01:11:38.176
'Cause here's a young
girl who's married,

01:11:38.177 --> 01:11:41.216
<i>whose hopes and dreams
and life</i>

01:11:41.217 --> 01:11:44.154
<i>is in him,
and he's a screw-up.</i>

01:11:44.155 --> 01:11:47.560
And if he ends up overdosing
and killing himself

01:11:47.561 --> 01:11:50.333
<i>or if he ends up on the rocks,
he's taking her with him.</i>

01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:53.204
I'm not moving out there
with the hopes and dreams of--

01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:55.609
I'm not gonna wait tables and
hope I'm gonna be an actor.

01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:57.379
I already did that--
15 years of wrestling.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.748
<i>You think
you'll get noticed?</i>

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:00.785
I'm not moving out
to get noticed,

01:12:00.786 --> 01:12:02.822
but you're never gonna get
noticed in Poughkeepsie.

01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:05.260
In Hollywood you're walking down
the street, somebody sees you--

01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:07.230
"hey, you got a minute?"
you just never know.

01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:09.234
<i>You don't think
there's any way</i>

01:12:09.235 --> 01:12:11.237
<i>he can get past it?</i>

01:12:11.238 --> 01:12:13.475
A miracle.

01:12:15.814 --> 01:12:18.484
I'm serious.

01:12:18.485 --> 01:12:20.989
I think they're gonna
find him dead someday.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.528
I thought bringing up boys--
this is easy.

01:12:24.529 --> 01:12:27.301
At least I don't have
a daughter who's, like,

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:29.404
got her face in the bowl
throwing up.

01:12:29.405 --> 01:12:32.510
You know, did I--
did I do something

01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:34.514
as a mother

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:37.052
To make you feel,

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.788
like, not good enough?

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:41.794
<i>When Mike went off to college
and he calls your father up</i>

01:12:41.795 --> 01:12:43.263
<i>and says,
"can I try steroids?"</i>

01:12:43.264 --> 01:12:46.903
"No, you're not getting
money to try steroids."

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:51.645
You know, we both thought
that was a crazy thing, so--

01:12:51.646 --> 01:12:53.783
<i>but do you know where he
ended up getting 'em from?</i>

01:12:53.784 --> 01:12:56.688
- No, but I wasn't gonna-- - He
got 'em from your brother John.

01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:58.091
No--

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:02.866
<i>So that's-- I mean, it's
something that's like,</i>

01:13:02.867 --> 01:13:04.869
<i>you know,
in our family.</i>

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:06.873
<i>I mean, it's something
that, like--</i>

01:13:06.874 --> 01:13:09.378
Chris, you're already
killing me with this as it is.

01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:11.282
<i>- Well, I'm telling--
- It just gets worse.</i>

01:13:11.283 --> 01:13:12.951
<i>I'm just telling you
the truth.</i>

01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:15.689
I'm just trying to tell
you how I feel as a mother.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:18.294
I am broken
to my soul.

01:13:18.295 --> 01:13:19.964
My heart is broken.

01:13:21.668 --> 01:13:23.671
<i>When you were growing up
Hulk Hogan--</i>

01:13:23.672 --> 01:13:25.742
<i>look what he's saying.
"take your vitamins,</i>

01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:27.946
<i>say your prayers--"
and what?</i>

01:13:27.947 --> 01:13:30.249
- "believe in yourself."
- Yeah, but it's not true.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:32.988
- So I started working out.
- "Take your steroids," okay?

01:13:32.989 --> 01:13:35.426
I don't know if he
ever prays or not.

01:13:35.427 --> 01:13:39.333
Never heard him talk about
god in his whole life, okay?

01:13:39.334 --> 01:13:41.337
Now that time
has gone by,

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:43.240
I'm like,
"is this guy a fraud?"

01:13:43.241 --> 01:13:45.779
And that's where I think
that everybody needs

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.817
to begin to accept--
"I am who I am,"

01:13:48.818 --> 01:13:50.788
said Popeye
the sailor man.

01:13:50.789 --> 01:13:52.824
He even was a gyp.

01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:55.430
- He had to take spinach.
- He had to take spinach.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.934
<i>Everybody needs something.
I mean, what's up with that?</i>

01:13:57.935 --> 01:14:00.806
If I just accept who I am right
now, isn't that just giving up?

01:14:00.807 --> 01:14:03.077
No, accept who you are
as a person.

01:14:03.078 --> 01:14:05.247
Then your body image
is something different.

01:14:05.248 --> 01:14:07.752
Do you think a fat person
hasn't tried everything

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:10.423
that's legal? But I'm
not gonna cross the line.

01:14:10.424 --> 01:14:13.696
<i>The Bible lays everything out
about how to live your life.</i>

01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:15.934
<i>- But the bible can't solve all your problems.
- It can.</i>

01:14:15.935 --> 01:14:18.839
I can't pray to look like Arnold
Schwarzenegger. It's not gonna happen.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.477
No, you can't pray to look
like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

01:14:21.478 --> 01:14:23.481
but neither can you
take enough steroids

01:14:23.482 --> 01:14:26.420
or enough human growth hormone
to look like him either.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:28.824
- But you can get as close as you can.
- It's not gonna happen.

01:14:28.825 --> 01:14:31.562
You're fearfully
and wonderfully made.

01:14:31.563 --> 01:14:35.102
Every sinew in your body,
every muscle, every fiber

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.507
was made by god.
And you're exactly

01:14:37.508 --> 01:14:39.511
<i>who he intended you
to be.</i>

01:14:39.512 --> 01:14:42.649
<i>And so what? To somebody
with a six-pack of abs.</i>

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:44.653
Maybe they don't have
what you have.

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:47.793
I mean, you know, why don't
you ever think that way too?

01:14:47.794 --> 01:14:51.031
What I don't get is
why did our boys

01:14:51.032 --> 01:14:54.070
Not feel that they were
good enough?

01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:00.515
My father or my grandfather

01:15:00.516 --> 01:15:02.486
never worried about

01:15:02.487 --> 01:15:04.490
whether they had a six-pack
of abdominals

01:15:04.491 --> 01:15:06.961
or what percentage
of body fat they had.

01:15:06.962 --> 01:15:11.035
So why is it now
in the 21st century

01:15:11.036 --> 01:15:13.172
that there's this
huge preoccupation

01:15:13.173 --> 01:15:15.310
with body image that
just didn't exist before?

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:18.014
<i>Dr. Harrison
pope is a psychiatrist</i>

01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:21.554
<i>who studies why American men are
becoming more obsessed with their bodies.</i>

01:15:21.555 --> 01:15:24.359
So here
we have G.I. Joe

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.663
from the 1960s.

01:15:26.664 --> 01:15:29.368
This is when he first came out
at the time of the Vietnam war.

01:15:29.369 --> 01:15:31.506
He's a perfectly
normal-looking dude.

01:15:31.507 --> 01:15:34.945
Here is G.I. Joe
from about 10 years later,

01:15:34.946 --> 01:15:36.782
- from the mid-1970s.
- He's got abs now.

01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:39.387
He's clearly been putting
in some time in the gym.

01:15:39.388 --> 01:15:43.227
- And then here is G.I. Joe from the 1990s.
- Oh, jeez.

01:15:43.228 --> 01:15:46.065
The bicep is
up to 16" or so,

01:15:46.066 --> 01:15:48.103
full six-pack of abs,

01:15:48.104 --> 01:15:50.340
even got serratus muscles
visible on the side.

01:15:50.341 --> 01:15:52.344
This evolution
in the action figures

01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:54.582
is a testimony

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.253
to this increased
preoccupation with body image

01:15:57.254 --> 01:15:59.357
that we've been seeing
in the United States.

01:15:59.358 --> 01:16:01.728
And it's funny
that in our culture

01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:04.667
we still tend
to romanticize

01:16:04.668 --> 01:16:06.671
steroids
to a certain way--

01:16:06.672 --> 01:16:09.809
That you'll see an ad
for an S.U.V. that says,

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:12.247
"this is our sedan
on steroids."

01:16:12.248 --> 01:16:14.318
But you wouldn't see an
ad for an S.U.V. saying,

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:16.222
"this is our sedan
on cocaine."

01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:19.293
<i>Well, it's sort of
like a golf cart on steroids.</i>

01:16:19.294 --> 01:16:22.066
It looked like an
easy-bake oven on steroids.

01:16:22.067 --> 01:16:23.935
It's sort of
the economy on steroids.

01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:25.706
Think of it as Apollo
on steroids.

01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:28.310
This year the jet stream
has really been on steroids.

01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:31.917
Kosovo would be
Bosnia on steroids.

01:16:31.918 --> 01:16:34.121
<i>Adding more U.S.
trainers and advisors,</i>

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.826
<i>essentially putting the
current strategy on steroids.</i>

01:16:36.827 --> 01:16:39.731
We are besieged
every day

01:16:39.732 --> 01:16:43.805
<i>with images of muscular
male bodies on T.V.,</i>

01:16:43.806 --> 01:16:46.277
<i>in the movies, in cartoons,
on magazines</i>

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.185
at the checkout counter
in the department store,

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:51.145
<i>all of which seem
to give this message</i>

01:16:52.446 --> 01:16:55.406
<i>that a real man
is big and muscular.</i>

01:17:01.454 --> 01:17:03.246
There you go.
Just like that.

01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:05.831
Good. Give me some good
abs, Christian. That's it.

01:17:05.832 --> 01:17:07.917
I saw "Conan the Barbarian"
when I was 11.

01:17:07.918 --> 01:17:10.794
And at that moment I said,
"that's exactly what I want to do."

01:17:10.795 --> 01:17:13.212
And I started to study
Arnold and his achievements.

01:17:13.214 --> 01:17:15.215
So I started training
with weights when I was 14.

01:17:15.216 --> 01:17:16.925
I started taking
steroids when I was 16.

01:17:16.926 --> 01:17:19.009
<i>So you're advertising
a supplement.</i>

01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:21.137
<i>So a guy like me goes
and looks in the magazine</i>

01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:23.305
<i>and I see Christian Boeving
and I'm like, "wow, man,</i>

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.474
I wanna look like that guy."
so I go and take

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:27.601
<i>Hydroxycut
or some supplement</i>

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:30.187
<i>because I think that
I'm gonna look like you.</i>

01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:32.480
But what I don't know is
that you were taking steroids.

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:34.440
Do you have
any problem with that?

01:17:36.067 --> 01:17:38.026
That's a double-edged
sword, my friend.

01:17:38.027 --> 01:17:39.987
How to answer this?

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.988
<i>Somebody looks at an ad
with me in it</i>

01:17:41.989 --> 01:17:44.282
and says, "Christian
Boeving takes Hydroxycut,"

01:17:44.283 --> 01:17:46.284
Which I did
and I do.

01:17:46.285 --> 01:17:48.827
That doesn't necessarily mean
that I don't take something else.

01:17:48.829 --> 01:17:50.621
If they choose
to believe

01:17:50.622 --> 01:17:52.998
that that's the only thing
I'm taking to look like that,

01:17:52.999 --> 01:17:54.958
then so be it. They should
be smarter than that.

01:17:54.959 --> 01:17:57.503
Is it misleading?
Possibly a little bit, yeah.

01:17:57.504 --> 01:18:00.589
But is it a lie?
Absolutely not.

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:03.007
I'd say probably 80% to
90%-- I'm not kidding you--

01:18:03.008 --> 01:18:04.967
of all the stuff
I see in magazines

01:18:04.968 --> 01:18:07.803
is complete hogwash.
It's ridiculous to me.

01:18:07.804 --> 01:18:10.847
<i>I don't understand why there's
this need in advertising</i>

01:18:10.849 --> 01:18:12.641
<i>To really
manipulate things--</i>

01:18:12.642 --> 01:18:14.642
<i>The bone-thin
fashion models</i>

01:18:14.643 --> 01:18:16.686
<i>that got all kinds
of eating disorders,</i>

01:18:16.687 --> 01:18:18.104
<i>and with men
it's the opposite.</i>

01:18:18.105 --> 01:18:20.023
<i>They get
the Adonis complex.</i>

01:18:20.024 --> 01:18:22.232
<i>And then there's all
kinds of trouble ahead</i>

01:18:22.234 --> 01:18:25.193
'cause you have all these kids who
are like you and me when we were young

01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:27.904
<i>looking at all these people
and they're perfect.</i>

01:18:27.906 --> 01:18:30.865
And how does that make somebody
feel who's not as perfect

01:18:30.866 --> 01:18:32.200
as the people they're
seeing? Not very good.

01:18:33.744 --> 01:18:35.786
So this stuff
I've tried--

01:18:35.787 --> 01:18:37.371
loaded with sugar.

01:18:37.372 --> 01:18:40.165
I've tried this.
I've tried this.

01:18:40.167 --> 01:18:41.417
Of course I've
tried this.

01:18:41.418 --> 01:18:43.001
Everybody I think's
tried muscle milk.

01:18:43.003 --> 01:18:44.795
I've tried this.
I've tried this.

01:18:44.796 --> 01:18:46.505
I've tried
all these drinks.

01:18:46.506 --> 01:18:49.423
If speed stack weren't enough,
you have extreme speed stack.

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.550
<i>The supplement
industry is very unregulated.</i>

01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:53.469
You don't have to have
F.D.A. approval

01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:55.179
To come out with
a dietary supplement.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.347
<i>That gives people room
to come out</i>

01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:59.725
<i>with some lower-quality
products.</i>

01:18:59.726 --> 01:19:02.477
This product says
"new legal formula" on it.

01:19:02.478 --> 01:19:04.938
I don't know what
the old formula really had in it.

01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:06.814
"Belizean Man Vine
Extract."

01:19:06.815 --> 01:19:08.607
I don't
want any part of that.

01:19:08.609 --> 01:19:11.110
"Best if used by date and
lot number on bottom of can."

01:19:11.111 --> 01:19:12.402
Yeah.

01:19:14.447 --> 01:19:16.280
<i>I always thought
the health industry</i>

01:19:16.282 --> 01:19:18.199
<i>was about,
you know, health.</i>

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.285
<i>Why does it feel like
we're back in the wild west?</i>

01:19:20.286 --> 01:19:21.911
It'll clean your teeth
and curl your hair!

01:19:21.912 --> 01:19:23.328
<i>The best in the west.</i>

01:19:23.329 --> 01:19:25.206
I wouldn't be dead
without a bottle.

01:19:25.207 --> 01:19:28.791
<i>Well, we can all thank the
senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch.</i>

01:19:28.793 --> 01:19:30.877
Look how good he looks.

01:19:30.879 --> 01:19:33.171
I want to get his brand
is what I want to do.

01:19:33.172 --> 01:19:35.966
<i>See, the health industry
is big business in Utah.</i>

01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:39.343
<i>They make almost a quarter of all
the dietary supplements in America.</i>

01:19:39.344 --> 01:19:42.012
<i>And supplements are
a $24-billion industry.</i>

01:19:42.014 --> 01:19:43.972
<i>So you do the math.</i>

01:19:43.973 --> 01:19:46.974
<i>Making supplements used to be
like making prescription drugs.</i>

01:19:46.976 --> 01:19:49.227
<i>You had to prove your
product was safe and effective</i>

01:19:49.228 --> 01:19:52.563
<i>before you could sell it. Well,
the supplement cowboys in Utah</i>

01:19:52.564 --> 01:19:54.690
<i>thought that was
a real hassle.</i>

01:19:54.691 --> 01:19:57.567
<i>So they asked their favorite
senator to change the rules around.</i>

01:19:57.568 --> 01:20:00.112
<i>And now you don't have to prove
your product is safe at all.</i>

01:20:00.113 --> 01:20:01.988
<i>And the F.D.A. has to prove
that it's not safe</i>

01:20:01.989 --> 01:20:04.449
<i>If they want to take it
off the market.</i>

01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:05.950
What is this
red goop?

01:20:05.951 --> 01:20:08.661
This is the Canadian version
of redline.

01:20:08.662 --> 01:20:12.164
We had to take out some of the
ingredients that aren't legal in Canada.

01:20:12.165 --> 01:20:15.500
<i>Thanks to this deregulation,
the supplement industry exploded</i>

01:20:15.501 --> 01:20:19.337
<i>And all sorts of new and interesting
people got in on the action.</i>

01:20:19.338 --> 01:20:21.422
We were always a good team,
whether we were selling drugs

01:20:21.423 --> 01:20:23.340
or whether we were selling
a supplement like we are now.

01:20:23.342 --> 01:20:26.301
"Jekyll & Hyde" supplements,
formulated to awaken your other side.

01:20:26.303 --> 01:20:28.595
Take this and all of a sudden
you become the freak, the monster.

01:20:28.596 --> 01:20:30.597
Everybody wants
to become a monster.

01:20:30.598 --> 01:20:33.517
<i>If Valentino can make a
supplement I bet anyone can do it.</i>

01:20:33.518 --> 01:20:35.309
Hola.

01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:37.979
- How many guys you need?
- I need two guys.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.855
<i>- We're making dietary
supplements. - Uh-huh.</i>

01:20:39.856 --> 01:20:42.066
<i>And I just need a hand with a
couple things. It'd be really easy.</i>

01:20:44.444 --> 01:20:46.278
All I need you guys to do
is take the white--

01:20:46.279 --> 01:20:47.112
Put inside?
Boom.

01:20:50.116 --> 01:20:53.158
<i>First you buy a bunch
of really popular ingredients.</i>

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.119
<i>But the trick is
I'm just gonna use</i>

01:20:55.121 --> 01:20:57.454
<i>- a tiny amount of each one.
- Oof.</i>

01:20:57.455 --> 01:21:00.874
<i>It's what we like to call in the
supplement biz "pixie dusting."</i>

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:02.709
<i>See, I can hide
my secret formula</i>

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:04.711
<i>behind the term
"proprietary blend"</i>

01:21:04.712 --> 01:21:06.754
<i>and not reveal
that it's pretty much</i>

01:21:06.756 --> 01:21:09.465
<i>just a pillful
of rice flour.</i>

01:21:09.467 --> 01:21:12.468
It's a good way to make a lot of money.

01:21:12.469 --> 01:21:14.804
<i>Don't sneeze
in the supplements here.</i>

01:21:16.765 --> 01:21:19.391
<i>But with all those
expensive ingredients on the label</i>

01:21:19.392 --> 01:21:21.976
<i>I can make this bottle
for about a buck 40</i>

01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:24.228
<i>and sell it for $60.</i>

01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:26.605
<i>Thanks, Orrin.</i>

01:21:26.606 --> 01:21:28.732
We're in the supplement
business now.

01:21:28.733 --> 01:21:31.734
<i>The scary part is that
everything I just did is by the book--</i>

01:21:31.735 --> 01:21:34.363
<i>Well, except for the
illegal-immigrant day laborers.</i>

01:21:34.364 --> 01:21:37.574
<i>But hey, nobody's
regulating them either.</i>

01:21:37.575 --> 01:21:40.076
<i>Now I just need a
misleading advertisement.</i>

01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:42.535
Do you airbrush these guys a lot
when you put them in magazines?

01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:44.788
Definitely. There's all
kinds of techniques and tools

01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:47.165
<i>you can use to completely
manipulate the body.</i>

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:49.960
- Really? - In fact, some of the
"before" and "after" pictures--

01:21:49.961 --> 01:21:52.212
They could be done
on the same day.

01:21:52.213 --> 01:21:53.879
<i>You haven't shot them in the
same day, though, have you?</i>

01:21:53.881 --> 01:21:55.882
- I have, actually.
- Oh, you have?

01:21:55.883 --> 01:21:57.800
- Yeah.
- What do they do--?

01:21:57.801 --> 01:22:00.469
Is this the self-editing part?
I should keep my mouth shut?

01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:02.512
I could take anybody and
take a picture of them,

01:22:02.513 --> 01:22:03.804
make them look
their worst...

01:22:03.806 --> 01:22:06.515
think horrible thoughts,
depression.

01:22:08.603 --> 01:22:10.852
...and then through
all kinds of ways

01:22:10.854 --> 01:22:12.312
make them look
their best.

01:22:12.313 --> 01:22:14.648
Just don't
cut my nipple off.

01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:19.610
Agh!

01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:22.947
All right. Let me see here. Good.

01:22:22.949 --> 01:22:24.741
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:22:24.742 --> 01:22:26.242
Good.

01:22:26.243 --> 01:22:27.952
We can take it
a step further if we want

01:22:27.953 --> 01:22:29.787
in the befores
and the afters.

01:22:29.788 --> 01:22:31.413
<i>Basically, you can
take somebody</i>

01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:33.165
<i>and make them a little
fatter or shorter.</i>

01:22:33.166 --> 01:22:34.666
<i>Are people falling
for this?</i>

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:36.585
<i>They fall for it
all the time.</i>

01:22:36.586 --> 01:22:39.337
And it's beyond
what I can understand

01:22:39.338 --> 01:22:41.339
because it looks
so silly to me,

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.424
<i>but of course I'm somebody
who's had sort of an inside,</i>

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.967
<i>backstage pass to what's
really occurred,</i>

01:22:45.969 --> 01:22:48.803
<i>and I've been part of some of
these scams that have played out.</i>

01:22:48.804 --> 01:22:50.931
<i>So if unregulated
dietary supplements</i>

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.807
<i>are marketed like steroids</i>

01:22:52.808 --> 01:22:55.351
and sold by people
who are on steroids,

01:22:55.353 --> 01:22:58.437
<i>is it any wonder that so many people
are just taking the real thing?</i>

01:22:58.438 --> 01:23:00.897
<i>I mean, it's not like
they're hard to get.</i>

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:04.150
<i>You can cross the border and buy
them from a pet store in Mexico.</i>

01:23:04.152 --> 01:23:06.861
Testosterona, $15.

01:23:06.863 --> 01:23:08.279
But it's for your dog,
right?

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.988
Oh, it's for my dog.
Yeah, I forgot.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:12.283
Yeah yeah,
my dog's anemic.

01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.577
<i>Or you can buy them
on the internet like Mad Dog.</i>

01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:17.079
If you order online you can
get the shit for $250 a kit

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.456
Instead of paying somebody on the
black market $500 or $600 for a kit.

01:23:20.457 --> 01:23:23.376
<i>Or, if you have enough
money, you can get it legally.</i>

01:23:23.377 --> 01:23:27.129
<i>This is the annual convention
for the anti-aging medicine--</i>

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:30.757
<i>Booth after booth of all the
taboo performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

01:23:30.759 --> 01:23:34.011
<i>Stanozolol-- hey, that's
what Ben Johnson used.</i>

01:23:34.012 --> 01:23:37.388
<i>Nandrolone-- isn't that what
Shawne Merriman got caught with?</i>

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:38.973
<i>Oh, and human
growth hormone--</i>

01:23:38.974 --> 01:23:41.141
<i>They say Marion Jones
was taking that.</i>

01:23:41.143 --> 01:23:43.269
Human growth hormone
usage

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:45.396
has been rampant in baseball
and other sports.

01:23:45.397 --> 01:23:47.564
<i>Athletes use
H.G.H. because it works</i>

01:23:47.566 --> 01:23:50.275
<i>A lot like anabolic steroids.
And the best part is,</i>

01:23:50.277 --> 01:23:53.486
<i>there's no way to test for
it. Here's how you get it.</i>

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.362
<i>First you go to your
anti-aging doctor.</i>

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.989
Now the doctor might
not be a medical doctor.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:24:00.492
Like in my case--
he's a chiropractor.

01:24:00.493 --> 01:24:02.744
And chiropractors
can't prescribe drugs,

01:24:02.745 --> 01:24:05.121
but that's okay.
He just has another doctor

01:24:05.122 --> 01:24:07.040
write the prescriptions
for him.

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:10.042
But be careful-- prescribing
hormones for anti-aging

01:24:10.043 --> 01:24:13.921
is a felony. So you can't exactly
tell your anti-aging doctor

01:24:13.923 --> 01:24:15.922
that you're interested
in anti-aging.

01:24:15.924 --> 01:24:18.258
Not to worry, though--
just use the words

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.427
"hormone deficiency" instead.

01:24:20.428 --> 01:24:22.553
<i>First thing, doc will want
to do a little physical.</i>

01:24:22.554 --> 01:24:23.930
Aagh.

01:24:25.558 --> 01:24:27.725
<i>Do you have people come to
you to try to get steroids?</i>

01:24:27.726 --> 01:24:29.893
Absolutely.
But prescribing steroids--

01:24:29.895 --> 01:24:32.396
That's not what we do,
not at all.

01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:35.023
Mm-hmm. But it kind
of is what you do

01:24:35.024 --> 01:24:36.941
in a way,
in a different way.

01:24:36.943 --> 01:24:38.985
<i>Next you're
gonna get a urine test</i>

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:41.070
<i>to check your hormone
levels for 24 hours.</i>

01:24:41.071 --> 01:24:44.282
<i>That's a take-home test--
you know, scout's honor.</i>

01:24:44.283 --> 01:24:47.993
<i>Send in the test and a week
later go get your results.</i>

01:24:47.994 --> 01:24:50.120
<i>We got your
labs back here--</i>

01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:52.455
Urinary growth hormone
output.

01:24:52.456 --> 01:24:54.541
<i>But here's the
thing-- since the F.D.A.</i>

01:24:54.542 --> 01:24:57.125
<i>has never defined what a
hormone deficiency really is,</i>

01:24:57.127 --> 01:25:00.504
<i>Well, doc can pretty much interpret
the results however he wants.</i>

01:25:00.505 --> 01:25:02.422
You're a little bit low,
coming down.

01:25:02.424 --> 01:25:04.132
I'm gonna bring those
levels up to optimal.

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:06.301
<i>Now it may seem strange</i>

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.219
<i>that the most controversial
drugs in America</i>

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.054
<i>are being prescribed
using take-home tests,</i>

01:25:10.055 --> 01:25:13.265
<i>and in my case by a doctor
I never met,</i>

01:25:13.266 --> 01:25:15.726
<i>but hey, at least I'm not
the one breaking the law.</i>

01:25:15.727 --> 01:25:17.519
<i>Why don't you
just get it legally?</i>

01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:21.230
Um, I like getting it
the way I get it.

01:25:21.232 --> 01:25:23.108
It's cheap
and I can get it

01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:25.360
anytime I want.

01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:28.278
And I don't think there's
any real reason for me to--

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.072
I mean, I don't want
to go to a doctor.

01:25:30.073 --> 01:25:31.532
That's a pain
in the ass.

01:25:31.533 --> 01:25:33.366
<i>You ever worry
about getting arrested</i>

01:25:33.368 --> 01:25:35.244
<i>or cops coming after you
or anything like that?</i>

01:25:35.245 --> 01:25:37.204
<i>I'm not all that
concerned about it.</i>

01:25:37.205 --> 01:25:39.706
You can justify
anything to yourself.

01:25:39.707 --> 01:25:41.791
<i>And once you've
justified it to yourself</i>

01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:45.544
<i>then you just think it's
cool. You think it's okay.</i>

01:25:45.545 --> 01:25:47.504
So in my mind
it's okay.

01:25:47.505 --> 01:25:49.923
I pose the question
to people, say,

01:25:49.925 --> 01:25:54.469
"hey, if you had
to take a drug

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:57.054
with the side effects--
known side effects

01:25:57.055 --> 01:25:59.640
and the unknown effects
of the anabolic steroids

01:25:59.641 --> 01:26:02.601
To keep your job
right now

01:26:02.602 --> 01:26:05.938
and support your family,
would you do it?"

01:26:05.939 --> 01:26:08.981
Maintaining an erection
is very easy to do

01:26:08.983 --> 01:26:11.567
with the appropriate
chemical assistance.

01:26:11.569 --> 01:26:14.946
Liquid Viagra
injected into the penis.

01:26:14.947 --> 01:26:16.572
You inject this
in your penis?

01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:18.032
Yep.

01:26:18.033 --> 01:26:20.618
- Does it hurt?
- Um, not really.

01:26:20.619 --> 01:26:22.410
<i>It's not just
athletes and porn stars</i>

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:24.120
<i>Taking
performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

01:26:24.121 --> 01:26:26.163
<i>Just about everybody's
in on the action.</i>

01:26:26.164 --> 01:26:28.999
Probably the most common thing
is what we call go-pills.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.626
There's probably
different kinds,

01:26:30.628 --> 01:26:32.586
but dextramphetamine
is the big one.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.839
<i>They work wonders, they really
do, especially if you've been</i>

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.882
out there a long time and
it's hard to stay focused.

01:26:36.883 --> 01:26:38.633
What about you?

01:26:38.634 --> 01:26:41.302
Yeah, they'll spin you
right up.

01:26:41.303 --> 01:26:43.721
Many parents may not be
aware that their children

01:26:43.723 --> 01:26:46.390
are taking a drug
by the name of Adderall

01:26:46.391 --> 01:26:49.059
to improve their
academic performance.

01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:51.728
Adderall is
a powerful stimulant

01:26:51.729 --> 01:26:54.273
very much like cocaine

01:26:54.274 --> 01:26:55.856
or methamphetamine.

01:26:55.857 --> 01:26:57.650
It's not just for people
who have problems.

01:26:57.651 --> 01:26:59.986
People who think completely
fine-- I've taken Adderall

01:26:59.987 --> 01:27:02.029
in college here and there
to write a paper.

01:27:02.031 --> 01:27:03.780
And I said, "this is a
fun way to write a paper."

01:27:03.782 --> 01:27:06.283
Your test scores go up
and you're

01:27:06.284 --> 01:27:09.077
doing homework faster,
so you can do more work.

01:27:09.079 --> 01:27:11.454
All I did when I went to class--
my friends, should I talk to them?

01:27:11.456 --> 01:27:13.081
Nope, hold on. And I'd
be doing all my work.

01:27:13.082 --> 01:27:14.874
<i>And for every performance</i>

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:17.293
<i>there's a way
to enhance it.</i>

01:27:17.294 --> 01:27:18.961
<i>So you take beta-blockers
to calm you down?</i>

01:27:18.962 --> 01:27:20.921
It actually doesn't
calm me down.

01:27:20.922 --> 01:27:22.881
It prevents me
from getting nervous.

01:27:22.882 --> 01:27:24.758
<i>- Here we go.
I was in college</i>

01:27:24.759 --> 01:27:27.426
and I was having really really bad
problems with performance anxiety

01:27:27.428 --> 01:27:30.387
and it was actually making me question
what I was doing in the first place.

01:27:30.389 --> 01:27:33.432
A friend gave me beta-blockers
and I just couldn't believe it.

01:27:33.433 --> 01:27:37.853
I felt like I could get up there
and do exactly what I wanted to do

01:27:37.854 --> 01:27:41.647
and I wasn't hindered by
what my body was reacting to.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:47.612
Blocking that adrenaline
goes a long way

01:27:47.613 --> 01:27:50.030
towards enhancing
performance.

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:52.074
<i>So it's okay to
enhance your performance</i>

01:27:52.075 --> 01:27:54.660
<i>if you're a pilot,
a porn star,</i>

01:27:54.661 --> 01:27:56.786
<i>a musician
or a student,</i>

01:27:56.787 --> 01:27:59.079
<i>but if your job is to play
professional baseball,</i>

01:27:59.081 --> 01:28:00.915
<i>well, somehow that
makes you a cheater.</i>

01:28:04.085 --> 01:28:06.378
<i>Do you feel it's cheating?</i>

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.881
Not at all.
Oh, no, certainly not.

01:28:08.882 --> 01:28:11.049
<i>There is no
competition in music.</i>

01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:13.384
You know, this is
completely unlike sports.

01:28:13.385 --> 01:28:15.552
<i>What about
in an audition situation?</i>

01:28:15.554 --> 01:28:17.888
- Is there competition there?
- Yeah, there is.

01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:22.225
And, you know, a lot
of people take 'em

01:28:22.227 --> 01:28:24.603
and I don't see that
there's a problem with it.

01:28:24.604 --> 01:28:27.396
Was there any sort of moral
bridge to cross when you did it?

01:28:27.397 --> 01:28:28.690
Well, we're
in the porn business.

01:28:28.691 --> 01:28:30.608
There's not a whole lot
of morals to begin with.

01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:33.527
<i>Amphetamines in baseball--
they actually take the same pill</i>

01:28:33.528 --> 01:28:35.279
- As a go-pill.
- Yeah, I've heard that.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.573
In the clubhouse
they're called greenies.

01:28:37.574 --> 01:28:39.574
And some in the game say
they could be

01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:41.283
more common
than steroids.

01:28:41.285 --> 01:28:43.286
In sports
you should play fair.

01:28:43.287 --> 01:28:47.080
In war you shouldn't
play fair at all.

01:28:47.082 --> 01:28:49.166
<i>I've got some men on a road</i>

01:28:49.168 --> 01:28:51.918
<i>And it looks like a piece
of artillery firing at us.</i>

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.171
<i>I am rolling in
in self-defense.</i>

01:28:54.172 --> 01:28:55.631
<i>Shaq!</i>

01:28:55.632 --> 01:28:58.340
<i>In 2002 over Afghanistan</i>

01:28:58.342 --> 01:29:00.801
<i>two American pilots
on go-pills</i>

01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:02.929
<i>bombed a group
of friendly Canadians.</i>

01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:04.513
<i>I hope that
was the right thing to do.</i>

01:29:04.515 --> 01:29:06.056
ME too.

01:29:06.057 --> 01:29:08.975
<i>Four Canadian
soldiers were killed.</i>

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:11.853
<i>Doctors say the pilots'
snap judgment to open fire</i>

01:29:11.854 --> 01:29:14.314
<i>Is typical of someone
on speed.</i>

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.482
<i>The pilots were
charged with manslaughter,</i>

01:29:16.483 --> 01:29:18.067
<i>But they blamed
their go-pills</i>

01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:20.069
<i>and the charges
were dropped.</i>

01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:21.861
<i>No other country
in the world</i>

01:29:21.863 --> 01:29:23.989
<i>allows amphetamines
in their Air Force,</i>

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.991
<i>But in America
we require it.</i>

01:29:29.287 --> 01:29:32.163
<i>You know, America
is a very competitive place</i>

01:29:32.164 --> 01:29:34.623
and people will take advantage
of really anything they can

01:29:34.624 --> 01:29:36.625
in order to help
themselves in that struggle.

01:29:36.626 --> 01:29:38.627
I hate to say it, the
amount of beta-blockers

01:29:38.628 --> 01:29:40.962
that they've got me on right
now-- California traffic

01:29:40.963 --> 01:29:43.464
- doesn't bother me anymore.
- Really?

01:29:43.465 --> 01:29:45.174
<i>It's too easy
to get it from a doctor.</i>

01:29:45.175 --> 01:29:46.884
You say, "I can't
focus in class"

01:29:46.885 --> 01:29:48.886
And the doctor prescribes
it automatically.

01:29:48.887 --> 01:29:51.304
<i>And when you got Adderall
you just went to the doctor?</i>

01:29:51.306 --> 01:29:54.349
No, it's just
passed around at school.

01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:56.309
<i>- It's passed around at school?
- Passed around at school.</i>

01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:58.227
You turn on your T.V.

01:29:58.229 --> 01:30:00.771
And we push drugs, right?

01:30:00.772 --> 01:30:02.857
If you have a headache--
use this.

01:30:02.858 --> 01:30:05.400
If you have a pain in
your side-- use that.

01:30:05.402 --> 01:30:07.611
<i>If you want to go
to sleep-- use this.</i>

01:30:07.613 --> 01:30:09.113
If you want to wake up--
use that.

01:30:09.114 --> 01:30:11.572
We are the only
country in the world

01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:14.909
that permits
drugs of that kind

01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:17.870
to be advertised
directly to the consumer.

01:30:17.872 --> 01:30:20.123
<i>The American
pharmaceutical industry</i>

01:30:20.124 --> 01:30:22.541
<i>spends almost $5 billion
a year on advertising.</i>

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:26.919
<i>And we in turn spend $250
billion on their drugs.</i>

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:29.547
<i>That's more than
any other country by far.</i>

01:30:29.548 --> 01:30:32.175
<i>Are we the most unhealthy
people in the world</i>

01:30:32.176 --> 01:30:33.676
<i>Or do we just watch
too much T.V.?</i>

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.681
Everybody's on a drug. So
why because I'm on a drug

01:30:38.682 --> 01:30:40.724
does everybody have to
point a finger at me?

01:30:40.725 --> 01:30:42.934
<i>- Why am I the bad guy?
- 'Cause you're on steroids.</i>

01:30:42.935 --> 01:30:47.563
And steroids are bad.

01:30:49.899 --> 01:30:51.817
To help children
make right choices

01:30:51.818 --> 01:30:54.611
they need
good examples.

01:30:54.613 --> 01:30:59.115
Athletics play such an
important role in our society,

01:30:59.116 --> 01:31:01.743
but unfortunately,
some in professional sports

01:31:01.744 --> 01:31:03.869
are not setting
much of an example.

01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:06.330
<i>Long before George
Bush was the President</i>

01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:09.375
<i>he was the owner of the Texas
Rangers, a major league baseball team</i>

01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:12.669
<i>With none other than Jose
Canseco on the roster.</i>

01:31:12.671 --> 01:31:15.713
<i>Do you
think that the team trainers,</i>

01:31:15.714 --> 01:31:18.966
The managers, the general
managers and even the owners

01:31:18.967 --> 01:31:21.093
might have been aware

01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:23.387
that some players
were using steroids?

01:31:23.388 --> 01:31:26.807
No doubt in my mind.
Absolutely.

01:31:26.808 --> 01:31:28.766
<i>So did the President know</i>

01:31:28.768 --> 01:31:31.144
<i>that his players were
on the juice?</i>

01:31:31.145 --> 01:31:33.437
You've admitted to using
steroids in the past.

01:31:33.438 --> 01:31:36.107
Knowing what you know now
about them,

01:31:36.108 --> 01:31:38.691
<i>- would you have done it?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.528
The National Football League
has talked more

01:31:40.529 --> 01:31:42.487
about steroid testing
or human growth hormone.

01:31:42.489 --> 01:31:43.905
And I know
back in your day

01:31:43.906 --> 01:31:45.614
you've admitted
that you did that.

01:31:45.616 --> 01:31:47.658
Your stand
on that right now?

01:31:47.659 --> 01:31:50.619
I think it's good
to do doping tests

01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.621
and the trick obviously
to find a way

01:31:52.622 --> 01:31:54.164
of really doing
true testing.

01:31:54.165 --> 01:31:56.875
I think that
we have to do something

01:31:56.876 --> 01:31:59.043
about the drug use
in sports.

01:31:59.044 --> 01:32:03.423
And I think it does send the
wrong message to our children.

01:32:03.424 --> 01:32:06.508
<i>So Arnold wants
to crack down on steroids,</i>

01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:08.927
<i>but every year he sponsors
his own bodybuilding show,</i>

01:32:08.928 --> 01:32:10.679
<i>The Arnold Classic.</i>

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.180
And they don't drug-test
at all.

01:32:12.182 --> 01:32:14.349
Isn't it unbelievable, the
shape these guys are in,

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.142
I mean, how ripped they
are, how bid they are,

01:32:16.144 --> 01:32:18.978
how cut they are, their
posing routine and everything?

01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.397
I'm so proud of them. I tell
you, it is really amazing.

01:32:21.398 --> 01:32:23.273
<i>This year
Governor Schwarzenegger</i>

01:32:23.274 --> 01:32:25.693
<i>handed over the winning
trophy to Victor Martinez,</i>

01:32:25.694 --> 01:32:27.902
<i>a guy who was busted
for selling steroids</i>

01:32:27.904 --> 01:32:29.487
<i>just a couple
of years ago.</i>

01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:31.489
<i>And a few days
before this competition</i>

01:32:31.491 --> 01:32:34.742
<i>he was implicated
in another steroid scandal.</i>

01:32:34.743 --> 01:32:36.660
The bodybuilder
who won a competition

01:32:36.661 --> 01:32:39.246
sponsored by Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger this past weekend

01:32:39.247 --> 01:32:41.331
has been linked to a
steroid investigation.

01:32:41.332 --> 01:32:43.876
<i>A spokesman for the Governor
says Schwarzenegger did not know</i>

01:32:43.877 --> 01:32:46.127
<i>of Martinez's links
to steroids.</i>

01:32:46.128 --> 01:32:49.005
<i>Come on, Arnold, what
do you mean you didn't know?</i>

01:32:49.006 --> 01:32:50.881
<i>Okay, let's compare.</i>

01:32:50.882 --> 01:32:53.592
<i>Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger
when he was on steroids--</i>

01:32:53.593 --> 01:32:57.470
<i>6'2", 235 lbs.</i>

01:32:57.472 --> 01:32:59.555
<i>And here's
Victor Martinez,</i>

01:32:59.556 --> 01:33:02.767
<i>seven inches shorter
and 15 lbs heavier.</i>

01:33:02.769 --> 01:33:05.145
Give him a big hand,
come on, a big hand.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.062
<i>You know, I've been
calling Arnold's office</i>

01:33:07.063 --> 01:33:08.773
<i>For over a year
to get an interview,</i>

01:33:08.774 --> 01:33:10.858
<i>but his people
keep telling me</i>

01:33:10.859 --> 01:33:13.151
<i>that his position on
steroids is very clear.</i>

01:33:13.152 --> 01:33:14.986
<i>So the only way
to get an answer</i>

01:33:14.987 --> 01:33:16.821
<i>was to track him down
myself</i>

01:33:16.822 --> 01:33:18.698
<i>at a place I knew
he would show up--</i>

01:33:18.699 --> 01:33:20.658
<i>Muscle Beach.</i>

01:33:20.659 --> 01:33:23.702
<i>It was just a few weeks before
the Governor's reelection</i>

01:33:23.704 --> 01:33:26.663
<i>And Arnold went to where he
knew he could depend on support</i>

01:33:26.665 --> 01:33:28.664
<i>to cement
his voting base.</i>

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:31.752
<i>This was my big chance.
I waited for hours.</i>

01:33:31.753 --> 01:33:34.211
<i>And finally
there he was.</i>

01:33:34.213 --> 01:33:36.255
<i>And there was
this other guy,</i>

01:33:36.256 --> 01:33:38.882
<i>the tall guy, the one
in the middle. He saw me.</i>

01:33:38.883 --> 01:33:41.509
<i>This is how politics
work these days.</i>

01:33:41.511 --> 01:33:44.304
<i>The important thing when making
an appearance is the photo op.</i>

01:33:44.305 --> 01:33:46.389
<i>The tall guy's gonna
nod at me.</i>

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:48.475
<i>Then he's gonna point
Arnold in my direction.</i>

01:33:48.476 --> 01:33:52.186
<i>Arnold, his instincts honed
by years of being a huge star,</i>

01:33:52.187 --> 01:33:55.064
<i>instantly sizes up
the situation,</i>

01:33:55.065 --> 01:33:56.940
<i>notices
the various cameras</i>

01:33:56.941 --> 01:33:59.651
<i>and decides to use me to
further his reelection bid.</i>

01:33:59.652 --> 01:34:03.279
<i>Look at those arms.
Look at those arms.</i>

01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:05.698
<i>And instead of
talking about steroids</i>

01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:07.449
<i>and the cheating
culture of America,</i>

01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:09.451
<i>he compliments me
on my biceps</i>

01:34:09.452 --> 01:34:11.411
<i>and we end up on the
cover of the L.A. "Times."</i>

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.330
There he is.
Oh my God.

01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:15.082
<i>Not that I mind.</i>

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:17.208
<i>After all, it was kind
of like a dream come true.</i>

01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:19.585
Son of a bitch.

01:34:19.586 --> 01:34:23.381
<i>But I still have all
these unanswered questions.</i>

01:34:23.382 --> 01:34:25.173
<i>Let me tell
you this, first of all--</i>

01:34:25.175 --> 01:34:28.677
You can't knock Arnold
really, okay?

01:34:28.678 --> 01:34:31.805
Because the steroids didn't get
him into that office that he's in.

01:34:31.806 --> 01:34:33.681
But he basically comes out
and he says,

01:34:33.682 --> 01:34:36.392
"if you work hard
and you play by the rules

01:34:36.393 --> 01:34:38.519
this country is truly
open to you.

01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:40.938
You can achieve anything."
but did he get to where he is

01:34:40.939 --> 01:34:44.065
playing by the rules? Or would
he have ever even been famous

01:34:44.066 --> 01:34:45.901
had he not taken
those drugs?

01:34:45.902 --> 01:34:47.777
<i>Well, let's look at it
this way--</i>

01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:49.904
<i>Let's talk
about other heroes.</i>

01:34:49.906 --> 01:34:53.240
<i>Let's talk about John Kennedy.
He was a hero in the Navy.</i>

01:34:53.241 --> 01:34:56.494
John Kennedy served as the
President of the United States.

01:34:56.495 --> 01:35:00.122
<i>But John Kennedy cheated on his
wife right in the White House</i>

01:35:00.123 --> 01:35:03.417
with Marilyn Monroe and who
knows how many others, okay?

01:35:03.418 --> 01:35:05.710
It's no different
than biblical characters.

01:35:05.711 --> 01:35:08.962
Moses was a hero
but Moses was a heel.

01:35:08.963 --> 01:35:10.756
He didn't get
into the Promised Land.

01:35:10.757 --> 01:35:12.841
He didn't do
what God told him to do.

01:35:12.842 --> 01:35:16.553
David was a hero--
King David was a hero,

01:35:16.554 --> 01:35:19.222
But David was a heel.
He chased every woman

01:35:19.224 --> 01:35:21.182
in a skirt,
or in a toga,

01:35:21.183 --> 01:35:22.683
or whatever they wore
back then.

01:35:22.684 --> 01:35:25.227
Every man is fallible

01:35:25.228 --> 01:35:27.354
and even the people

01:35:27.355 --> 01:35:29.564
who were
the prime examples

01:35:29.565 --> 01:35:31.566
of how to run your life
in the bible

01:35:31.567 --> 01:35:34.402
screwed up.
They all screwed up.

01:35:34.403 --> 01:35:36.863
So people need
to get off their

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:39.949
self-righteous
soapboxes

01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:41.784
and start loving
each other.

01:35:41.785 --> 01:35:44.161
We just need to go out
there and do our jobs,

01:35:44.162 --> 01:35:47.580
just as you professionals
do your job.

01:35:47.582 --> 01:35:50.124
All of you guys lied.

01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:52.126
All of y'all

01:35:52.128 --> 01:35:54.254
in a story or whatever
have lied.

01:35:54.255 --> 01:35:57.047
<i>Should you have an asterisk
behind your name?</i>

01:35:57.048 --> 01:35:59.049
All of you have lied.

01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:01.050
All of you have said
something wrong.

01:36:01.052 --> 01:36:03.970
All of you have dirt,
all of you.

01:36:03.971 --> 01:36:05.972
When your
closet's clean

01:36:05.973 --> 01:36:07.973
then come clean
somebody else's.

01:36:07.975 --> 01:36:10.351
But clean yours first.

01:36:10.352 --> 01:36:12.394
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

01:36:12.395 --> 01:36:13.938
The last name is Bell,
B-E-L-L.

01:36:16.566 --> 01:36:19.150
<i>I took
the oath to serve you.</i>

01:36:19.151 --> 01:36:23.570
<i>I say to everyone here today
and to all Californians,</i>

01:36:23.572 --> 01:36:25.865
I will not forget
my oath

01:36:25.866 --> 01:36:27.741
And I will not
forget you.

01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:35.332
<i>A few months
after I voted for Arnold</i>

01:36:35.333 --> 01:36:37.375
<i>his people told
Gold's Gym</i>

01:36:37.376 --> 01:36:38.960
<i>to remove
all of his images.</i>

01:36:48.386 --> 01:36:50.970
What is the meaning
of this?

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:53.556
<i>It's a dark day
in Gold's Gym.</i>

01:36:53.557 --> 01:36:55.892
<i>They're taking down
Arnold's poster.</i>

01:36:55.893 --> 01:36:58.143
Do you have a lot of respect for
Arnold? Is he one of your heroes?

01:36:58.144 --> 01:37:00.687
Well, he was until
he took his shit down.

01:37:00.689 --> 01:37:02.189
You know, that guy's
a traitor, man.

01:37:07.569 --> 01:37:09.779
<i>The gym feels different now.</i>

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.780
<i>The old Arnold's gone</i>

01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:13.782
<i>and somehow this time</i>

01:37:13.784 --> 01:37:15.533
<i>I don't think
he'll be back.</i>

01:37:19.079 --> 01:37:21.831
So you're excited to be out
here instead of in Poughkeepsie?

01:37:21.833 --> 01:37:23.624
Hell yeah, man.
I got a job making

01:37:23.625 --> 01:37:25.417
three times as much money and
my rent's just about the same

01:37:25.419 --> 01:37:27.127
and I'm right by the beach
and I got a convertible.

01:37:27.128 --> 01:37:29.838
Right here next to
the mirror, honey.

01:37:29.839 --> 01:37:31.130
Put a little
muscle in it.

01:37:31.132 --> 01:37:33.966
Here you go.
- Higher.

01:37:33.968 --> 01:37:36.636
So what do you plan on doing here
that you weren't doing in Poughkeepsie?

01:37:36.637 --> 01:37:38.971
Jeez, like having fun with
life instead of hating life.

01:37:38.972 --> 01:37:42.140
Think it'll help you with
your problems and stuff?

01:37:42.142 --> 01:37:44.018
Absolutely.
I feel better already.

01:37:44.019 --> 01:37:46.019
<i>Now that Mad
Dog's in California,</i>

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.938
<i>Things seem to be going
pretty good for him.</i>

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:51.733
<i>He got a job working as a trainer
at a local wrestling school.</i>

01:37:51.734 --> 01:37:53.734
Got you! Now if I
want to take it here--

01:37:53.735 --> 01:37:55.486
Keep your face up,
keep your face up.

01:37:55.488 --> 01:37:57.905
<i>He'd actually
make a great teacher,</i>

01:37:57.906 --> 01:37:59.824
<i>but that's not good
enough for Mad Dog.</i>

01:37:59.825 --> 01:38:02.283
<i>He still wants
to be a superstar.</i>

01:38:02.285 --> 01:38:05.495
<i>So this Sunday night, pay
per view, Madison Square Garden!</i>

01:38:05.497 --> 01:38:08.331
Hell's Henrys will toll
for you.

01:38:10.917 --> 01:38:14.628
Just not--
I'm sick, though, dude.

01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:17.172
<i>Mad Dog sent
his promo to the W.W.E.,</i>

01:38:17.173 --> 01:38:19.883
<i>but they rejected him
again.</i>

01:38:19.884 --> 01:38:22.010
<i>They said
he's too old</i>

01:38:22.011 --> 01:38:24.095
<i>and not what they're
looking for right now.</i>

01:38:24.096 --> 01:38:26.556
<i>You know, I want to
believe that the world is good,</i>

01:38:26.557 --> 01:38:29.725
<i>but it's not.
And I want to try hard,</i>

01:38:29.726 --> 01:38:31.351
but why try
when you can't win?

01:38:31.353 --> 01:38:33.436
Those who can't do,
train.

01:38:33.437 --> 01:38:36.147
It's just I never
understood why I didn't,

01:38:36.148 --> 01:38:38.066
you know?

01:38:38.067 --> 01:38:40.902
<i>What's the problem with
just being a normal guy?</i>

01:38:40.903 --> 01:38:42.570
<i>What's wrong with
just being normal?</i>

01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:44.696
There's nothing wrong
with it.

01:38:44.697 --> 01:38:46.698
Well, actually, there is
something wrong with it.

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.492
the thing that's
wrong with it is

01:38:48.493 --> 01:38:50.577
that I was born to attain
greatness and I'm the only one

01:38:50.578 --> 01:38:53.704
that's holding myself back. And I need
to attain greatness. I need to do it.

01:38:53.705 --> 01:38:56.165
<i>You live down by the beach,
you have a beautiful wife,</i>

01:38:56.166 --> 01:38:57.833
<i>and nothing's ever
good enough.</i>

01:38:57.835 --> 01:39:00.502
I can only imagine
how she feels.

01:39:00.503 --> 01:39:03.463
And do you ever think,

01:39:03.464 --> 01:39:06.549
"why am I dragging
somebody else in this?"

01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:09.968
I know that a lot of times
she's crying herself to sleep.

01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:13.764
And I know that
sometimes she doesn't glow

01:39:13.765 --> 01:39:16.099
the way that she did
when I first met her.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.519
And I know
it's my fault.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.353
And it really
tears me up.

01:39:20.355 --> 01:39:22.021
<i>Yeah.
Well, I mean,</i>

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:24.064
<i>I worry every day
that--</i>

01:39:24.066 --> 01:39:26.317
What I worry about is
you're gonna lose your job,

01:39:26.318 --> 01:39:29.320
<i>You're gonna lose your wife and
then you're gonna lose yourself.</i>

01:39:29.321 --> 01:39:31.280
If I lose my job and my
wife, what else do I have?

01:39:34.242 --> 01:39:36.368
<i>I just feel</i>

01:39:36.369 --> 01:39:38.870
<i>that I have more
to offer this world.</i>

01:39:38.871 --> 01:39:41.914
<i>And I don't know
exactly what it is</i>

01:39:41.915 --> 01:39:44.250
<i>or how I'm gonna
go about doing it.</i>

01:39:43.966 --> 01:39:46.591
I know there's
something in here

01:39:46.593 --> 01:39:49.343
That's meant for the
rest of the world to know.

01:39:54.307 --> 01:39:57.683
When you were kids

01:39:57.684 --> 01:39:59.809
you all admired

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:02.186
the champion marble shooter,
the fastest runner,

01:40:02.187 --> 01:40:06.313
big league ballplayers,
the toughest boxers.

01:40:06.314 --> 01:40:09.107
Americans love a winner

01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:11.151
and will not tolerate
a loser.

01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:22.450
<i>Smelly is now competing</i>

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:24.577
<i>against the best guys
in the world</i>

01:40:24.578 --> 01:40:26.745
<i>and he hopes to achieve
his childhood dream</i>

01:40:26.746 --> 01:40:28.622
<i>of bench-pressing
700 lbs.</i>

01:40:28.623 --> 01:40:31.081
<i>But he and his wife
agreed</i>

01:40:31.082 --> 01:40:34.667
<i>that this would be his
last meet on steroids.</i>

01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:37.419
I knew that she didn't
really care for it,

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:39.504
but i didn't know
it hurt her that much.

01:40:39.505 --> 01:40:42.381
And I didn't know she
worried that much about it.

01:40:42.383 --> 01:40:44.758
<i>It's definitely something
that's not gonna be easy to do.</i>

01:40:44.759 --> 01:40:47.051
<i>I don't necessarily want
to do it, but, you know,</i>

01:40:47.053 --> 01:40:48.927
if I just stay on it
and ignore her,

01:40:48.928 --> 01:40:50.512
that's just
being selfish.

01:40:50.513 --> 01:40:52.763
He's trying to have
another kid, so he decided

01:40:52.765 --> 01:40:54.765
that this is gonna be
his last meet

01:40:54.767 --> 01:40:56.891
that he ever
takes anything.

01:40:56.892 --> 01:40:59.851
How do you think that'll
affect his lifting?

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.937
It'll affect it somewhat,

01:41:01.938 --> 01:41:04.564
but once he tapers off
and has the child

01:41:04.565 --> 01:41:06.398
<i>he can go
right back on them.</i>

01:41:06.399 --> 01:41:08.650
But he doesn't want to go back
on them. His wife doesn't want him

01:41:08.651 --> 01:41:10.401
to be on it at all
ever again.

01:41:13.737 --> 01:41:15.738
The death of Smelly.

01:41:15.739 --> 01:41:17.740
You think so?

01:41:17.741 --> 01:41:19.491
Smelly will go back on.

01:41:19.492 --> 01:41:21.951
<i>So you'll never
take it again?</i>

01:41:21.952 --> 01:41:23.743
<i>- I'll never take 'em again?
- Yeah.</i>

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.453
No, I probably will
take 'em again

01:41:25.454 --> 01:41:27.913
<i>- because this is something--
- How?</i>

01:41:27.914 --> 01:41:30.165
Well, I'll figure out
a way.

01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:32.667
I mean, that's something I'll
have to talk out with Andee,

01:41:32.668 --> 01:41:34.501
but this is something
I've been--

01:41:34.502 --> 01:41:37.044
I've been involved in power
lifting since I was 12 years old.

01:41:37.045 --> 01:41:38.962
This is part of
what I like to do.

01:41:38.964 --> 01:41:41.507
And I'm not gonna go

01:41:41.508 --> 01:41:43.757
from squatting 800 lbs
to squatting 700 lbs.

01:41:43.759 --> 01:41:46.093
<i>I'm gonna want to get
back on 'em for sure.</i>

01:41:46.094 --> 01:41:48.428
<i>Which is kind of sad
'cause--</i>

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.554
Well, you know, a lot of
people have to lie to get ahead.

01:41:50.555 --> 01:41:53.973
That's just kind of
the way things work.

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:56.725
Well, we weren't
brought up as cheaters.

01:41:58.937 --> 01:42:01.103
Well, I mean,
people aren't brought up

01:42:01.105 --> 01:42:03.898
to rob a bank either. You're
not really trained to rob a bank

01:42:03.899 --> 01:42:06.357
or you're not really
trained to do drugs

01:42:06.358 --> 01:42:08.400
or taught to do drugs
or anything like that,

01:42:08.401 --> 01:42:10.068
but just, you know, it's
kind of the way you end up.

01:42:12.946 --> 01:42:14.446
Yeah!
Come on!

01:42:14.447 --> 01:42:16.781
Let's go, mark!
Go mark!

01:42:16.783 --> 01:42:18.825
Let's go, Mark. Come on!

01:42:18.826 --> 01:42:20.993
- Come on!
- Go Mark!

01:42:23.496 --> 01:42:25.746
Go Mark!
Let's go, Mark!

01:42:25.747 --> 01:42:28.289
Come on,
you got this.

01:42:28.291 --> 01:42:30.541
<i>Come on, you got it!
Let's go, come on!</i>

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.547
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

01:42:45.928 --> 01:42:48.012
<i>My baby
brother is on steroids</i>

01:42:48.013 --> 01:42:50.180
<i>and we all know it.</i>

01:42:50.182 --> 01:42:53.141
But look at us. My dad looks
like he won the lottery.

01:42:53.142 --> 01:42:56.351
And my mom's prayers
have been answered.

01:42:56.352 --> 01:42:59.270
<i>I was raised to believe
that cheaters never prosper,</i>

01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:02.564
<i>but in America it seems
like cheaters always prosper.</i>

01:43:05.067 --> 01:43:09.151
The use of performance-enhancing
drugs like steroids

01:43:09.152 --> 01:43:11.986
<i>is dangerous and it
sends the wrong message</i>

01:43:11.988 --> 01:43:15.405
<i>that there are shortcuts
to accomplishment</i>

01:43:15.407 --> 01:43:19.242
<i>And that performance is more
important than character.</i>

01:43:19.243 --> 01:43:21.369
<i>There is a clash in America</i>

01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:23.829
<i>Between doing the right
thing and being the best.</i>

01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:26.247
Americans play to win
all the time

01:43:26.249 --> 01:43:28.958
<i>because the very
thought of losing</i>

01:43:28.959 --> 01:43:31.542
<i>is hateful
to Americans.</i>

01:43:31.543 --> 01:43:35.170
It is out of here!

01:43:35.171 --> 01:43:39.090
<i>756!</i>

01:43:39.091 --> 01:43:41.215
<i>Bonds stands alone!</i>

<i>In a culture
where second place</i>

01:43:43.177 --> 01:43:45.510
<i>Is the first loser,</i>

01:43:45.512 --> 01:43:48.972
<i>the real heroes are the
ones who win at all costs.</i>

01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:51.515
Everything I have--
my career,

01:43:51.516 --> 01:43:53.892
my success,
my family--

01:43:53.893 --> 01:43:55.726
I owe to America.

01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:01.313
<i>This is America.</i>

01:44:01.315 --> 01:44:04.190
<i>We're the greatest

01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:07.193
<i>You could call us
a nation on steroids.</i>

<i>But what are those
long-term side effects?</i>

01:44:09.862 --> 01:44:11.863
<i>For me
and my brothers</i>

01:44:11.864 --> 01:44:14.698
<i>steroids are not

01:44:14.699 --> 01:44:16.908
<i>They're just another
side effect</i>

01:44:16.909 --> 01:44:18.535
<i>of being American.</i>

01:44:21.996 --> 01:44:26.498

01:45:27.918 --> 01:45:29.125

01:45:30.795 --> 01:45:32.503

<i># making too many problems #</i>

01:46:00.232 --> 01:46:02.315
