<i>NARRATOR: Kids, up to
this point in the story,</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.949
<i>we had found doppelgangers.--</i>

00:04.993 --> 00:06.562
Eerie but awesome look-alikes

00:06.608 --> 00:08.555
<i>for four of the five members
of our little group.</i>

00:09.052 --> 00:10.464
<i>There was Lesbian Robin...</i>

00:10.584 --> 00:11.458
(spits)

00:13.079 --> 00:14.581
<i>Mustache Marshall...</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:17.478
<i>Stripper Lily...</i>

00:18.656 --> 00:20.253
<i>and Mexican Wrestler Me.</i>

00:20.698 --> 00:21.969
<i>Yes, mine was the coolest.</i>

00:21.970 --> 00:23.103
(cheering)

00:23.104 --> 00:24.405
<i>And so we were all eager</i>

00:24.406 --> 00:26.507
<i>to find The Fifth Doppelganger:
Barney's.</i>

00:26.508 --> 00:28.042
<i>Turned out,
it was more important</i>

00:28.043 --> 00:29.476
<i>to some of us than others.</i>

00:29.477 --> 00:31.578
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

00:31.579 --> 00:33.914
until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?

00:33.915 --> 00:35.883
Yeah, of course.
Stands to reason.

00:35.884 --> 00:38.519
Okay, so, when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

00:38.520 --> 00:41.321
that's the universe
telling us it's go time.

00:41.322 --> 00:42.623
And that's when
we'll start trying.

00:42.624 --> 00:43.624
Deal?

00:43.625 --> 00:45.259
Deal.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.728
<i>And then one day,
a few weeks later...</i>

00:47.729 --> 00:48.829
Baby, were we serious about

00:48.830 --> 00:50.130
the whole Fifth
Doppelganger thing?

00:50.131 --> 00:52.066
I mean, having a baby
is a pretty big thing

00:52.067 --> 00:53.133
to leave up to the universe.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.702
Yeah, I know it's crazy.

00:54.703 --> 00:57.671
It's just so much easier
to let the universe decide.

00:58.773 --> 01:00.207
Why do you ask?

01:00.208 --> 01:01.341
Boom!

01:01.342 --> 01:02.843
Universed!

01:02.844 --> 01:03.811
Oh, my God!

01:03.812 --> 01:05.078
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.047
That could easily be Barney

01:07.048 --> 01:08.415
pulling some scam
to meet chicks.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.217
I'm one step ahead of you.

01:10.218 --> 01:11.452
Go for Barney.

01:11.453 --> 01:12.753
Barney, hey.
It's Marshall.

01:12.754 --> 01:14.254
So you are at work?

01:14.255 --> 01:15.556
You're not--
I don't know--

01:15.557 --> 01:17.458
driving a cab, wearing a wig.

01:17.459 --> 01:19.693
Yes, I'm at work.

01:19.694 --> 01:21.695
That's the sound of my stapler.

01:21.696 --> 01:23.130
That's the sound
of my three-hole punch.

01:23.131 --> 01:24.865
And this is the sound
of me filing

01:24.866 --> 01:27.167
my corporate guidelines
on sexual harassment.

01:27.168 --> 01:28.168
(shredder buzzes)

01:28.169 --> 01:29.703
What is up?!

01:29.704 --> 01:31.538
Got to go, Big Chief.

01:35.210 --> 01:37.678
Barney's at work.

01:37.679 --> 01:40.714
That-that was The
Fifth Doppelganger.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.752
Marshall Eriksen...

01:44.753 --> 01:46.720
put a baby in my belly.

01:48.656 --> 01:58.059
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:01.669 --> 02:03.337
I can't wait to tell the gang.

02:03.338 --> 02:05.973
This is one of those moments
you dream about.

02:05.974 --> 02:07.908
"Guys...

02:07.909 --> 02:09.675
"Lily and I...

02:09.676 --> 02:11.211
are having unprotected sex."

02:11.212 --> 02:12.846
Ooh, I just got the chills.

02:12.847 --> 02:14.381
We're not gonna say anything.

02:14.382 --> 02:15.382
What? Why?

02:15.383 --> 02:16.817
Marshall, if we tell them,

02:16.818 --> 02:18.685
we're basically
inviting them into

02:18.686 --> 02:21.722
the most private,
intimate moment of our lives.

02:26.294 --> 02:27.728
You guys banging?
(Marshall and Lily scream)

02:27.729 --> 02:30.330
Keep going; I'm
not even here.

02:30.331 --> 02:31.698
But just for the record,

02:31.699 --> 02:33.567
having a baby: huge mistake.

02:33.568 --> 02:35.035
Now, show me what you got.

02:35.036 --> 02:37.004
Uncle Teddy's here!
(Marshall and Lily scream)

02:37.005 --> 02:38.639
Quick question:
How you guys gonna handle

02:38.640 --> 02:39.673
the whole Santa thing?

02:39.674 --> 02:41.175
I'm thinking, just be honest.

02:41.176 --> 02:43.510
(chuckles):
Ah, hell. I'll dress up.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.679
This just in...
(Marshall and Lily scream)

02:45.680 --> 02:48.115
is what Marshall Eriksen
is about to say to his wife

02:48.116 --> 02:50.184
as he attempts
to impregnate her.

02:50.185 --> 02:54.621
Chopper 12 is live on the scene
with "Baby Watch: 2010."

02:54.622 --> 02:57.324
(helicopter hovering)

02:57.325 --> 03:00.060
(wind blustering)

03:01.329 --> 03:03.964
Okay, fine. I won't tell anybody
about the baby thing.

03:04.499 --> 03:05.465
Hey, guys.

03:05.466 --> 03:06.767
Hey.
Guys...

03:06.768 --> 03:08.702
We saw The Fifth Doppelganger!

03:08.703 --> 03:09.703
(gasps) Whoa!

03:09.704 --> 03:11.104
Amazing!
That is awesome!

03:11.105 --> 03:12.639
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, freaky.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.640
A brunette Barney.

03:13.641 --> 03:14.641
I know.

03:14.642 --> 03:16.076
Say what you will
about the guy,

03:16.077 --> 03:17.444
but Barney seems right
as a blond.

03:17.445 --> 03:18.645
Well, that's true.
Not every dude

03:18.646 --> 03:20.113
can pull that off
the blond look.

03:20.114 --> 03:22.316
I don't know about that.

03:22.317 --> 03:23.350
What?

03:23.351 --> 03:25.519
Oh, that summer
I was lifeguarding

03:25.520 --> 03:27.688
at the Chagrin Falls
Country Club,

03:27.689 --> 03:30.257
I was lathering a little
lemon juice into the old mop,

03:30.258 --> 03:32.159
playing with some
natural highlights.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.760
Let's just say there were a few

03:33.761 --> 03:37.531
senior citizens who pretended
to drown on my watch.

03:38.499 --> 03:39.533
And sadly, one who did.

03:39.534 --> 03:40.734
Anyway,

03:40.735 --> 03:42.603
I'd look good blond.

03:42.604 --> 03:45.005
<i>MARSHALL: Okay, people,

03:45.006 --> 03:47.908

<i>ROBIN:

03:53.348 --> 03:54.915
<i>We can't--

03:54.916 --> 03:56.149
<i>How do we do this?</i>

03:56.150 --> 03:57.784

03:57.785 --> 03:58.852
<i>Nachos?</i>

A bunch of people emphatically

04:05.260 --> 04:07.160
<i>telling him
not to do something.</i>

04:07.161 --> 04:08.962
<i>Follow my lead.</i>

04:08.963 --> 04:10.964
<i>TED:
Ah, screw it, I could eat.</i>

04:10.965 --> 04:12.733
Yes, we'd all like

04:12.734 --> 04:14.735
some nachos.

04:16.504 --> 04:19.740
I love you, buddy, but
there's absolutely no way

04:19.741 --> 04:21.507
that you could pull off blond.

04:21.509 --> 04:23.210
It-it just wouldn't
look right.

04:23.211 --> 04:26.313
Yeah, seriously, Ted,
don't go blond.

04:26.314 --> 04:28.081
(bangs table) I'm going blond!

04:28.082 --> 04:29.149
No!
No!

04:29.150 --> 04:30.317
That is not the outcome

04:30.318 --> 04:31.985
we were hoping for!

04:32.820 --> 04:34.288
<i>NARRATOR:
Now, kids, Robin and Don</i>

04:34.289 --> 04:36.456
<i>were becoming
such a great team, both off</i>

04:36.457 --> 04:39.192
<i>and on the air, that local
Channel 12 started asking them</i>

04:39.193 --> 04:42.329
<i>to guest-host some of
their other top-notch programs.</i>

04:49.270 --> 04:53.173
So, that's why Monty and I
vow never to do drugs.

04:53.174 --> 04:55.242
Because drugs are bad.

04:55.243 --> 04:57.144
Right, Monty?

04:57.145 --> 04:58.545
We, sure,

04:58.546 --> 05:00.547
man-made
chemical stuff.

05:00.548 --> 05:03.483
But things that grow in nature--

05:03.484 --> 05:06.853
they're okay to try,
like, once or twice.

05:06.854 --> 05:10.190
Not looking for
gray areas here, Monty.

05:10.191 --> 05:13.727
I don't think it's right
to lie to the kids, Moo-Moo.

05:13.728 --> 05:16.964
So... what are you saying?

05:16.965 --> 05:19.666
I've experimented with drugs.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.634
(gasps)

05:20.635 --> 05:22.736
<i>NARRATOR:

05:22.737 --> 05:24.404

05:24.405 --> 05:25.439
Mmm.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.241
Hmm, what was that for?

05:28.242 --> 05:30.610
Before I met you, I'd
given up on everything.

05:31.479 --> 05:34.081
Relationships, career, pants.

05:34.082 --> 05:35.282
(both chuckle)

05:36.918 --> 05:38.785
But you made me
want to try again.

05:39.821 --> 05:41.088
I love you for that.

05:41.089 --> 05:43.623
Oh. Huh?

05:43.624 --> 05:44.658
Ooh.
(chuckles)

05:44.659 --> 05:45.659
Oh, I see.

05:45.660 --> 05:47.794
Mmm.
(chuckles)

05:51.866 --> 05:53.767
Hi. Hey, hi.

05:53.768 --> 05:54.935
Sorry.

05:54.936 --> 05:56.236
Um, you don't know me,

05:56.237 --> 05:57.971
but I just wanted
to say thank you.

05:57.972 --> 06:00.741
You're actually a very
important person in my life.

06:00.742 --> 06:02.009
Important?

06:02.010 --> 06:03.610
More like legendary.

06:03.611 --> 06:05.479
Marshall, it's me!

06:05.480 --> 06:06.747
Barney!

06:06.748 --> 06:09.016
<i>NARRATOR: Oddly enough,
this would rank as only</i>

06:09.017 --> 06:10.984
<i>the second biggest surprise
of the day.</i>

06:10.985 --> 06:13.186
Wow, this is just very sudden.

06:13.187 --> 06:16.690
Sure, I can get you
an answer by tomorrow.

06:16.691 --> 06:17.724
Okay.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.227
Thanks.

06:20.228 --> 06:22.029
(sighs softly)

06:23.765 --> 06:25.265
Ted, something big
has just happened,

06:25.266 --> 06:27.067
and you're the most
sensible person I know.

06:27.068 --> 06:28.769
I need to talk to you right now.

06:28.770 --> 06:31.104
You know what, it can wait.

06:31.105 --> 06:33.273
No, go ahead. I'm listening.

06:33.274 --> 06:34.975
Okay, well,

06:34.976 --> 06:36.943
the executive producer from WNKW

06:36.944 --> 06:38.345
happened to see our
show the other morning

06:38.346 --> 06:40.247
and loved me.

06:40.248 --> 06:42.949
They offered me the lead
anchor job, starting next week.

06:42.950 --> 06:45.018
Wow, that's great!

06:45.019 --> 06:46.019
It is great.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.287
But, um, here's the catch.

06:47.288 --> 06:48.321
WNKW is in...

06:48.322 --> 06:49.322
(dryer whirring)

06:49.323 --> 06:51.625
H-Helen, kill the dryer!

06:52.660 --> 06:54.127
(dryer stops)

06:54.128 --> 06:55.962
Is in Chicago.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.215
But you were
The Fifth Doppelganger.

07:01.516 --> 07:03.250
How-how can you be you?

07:03.251 --> 07:05.486
I called you, Barney;
We had a whole conversation!

07:05.487 --> 07:07.588
Ah, yes, I know what happened.

07:07.589 --> 07:09.256
See, people at work have

07:09.257 --> 07:12.993
this very strange expectation
that I, well, work.

07:12.994 --> 07:14.161
(scoffs)

07:14.162 --> 07:15.929
I know, I know.

07:15.930 --> 07:18.465
<i>So to make my colleagues think
I'm busting my hump</i>

07:18.466 --> 07:21.201
<i>when I'm really out humping
busty chicks,</i>

07:21.202 --> 07:23.136
<i>I decided to record
a special message.</i>

07:23.137 --> 07:25.038
What is up?!

07:25.039 --> 07:26.773
Got to go, Big Chief.

07:26.774 --> 07:28.475
How can it be a recording?

07:28.476 --> 07:32.079
You called me Big Chief,
my special workplace nickname.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.815
Oh, buddy.

07:34.816 --> 07:36.750
(exhales forcefully)

07:36.751 --> 07:38.452
Hey, hey.

07:38.453 --> 07:40.387
Come on, Big Chief.

07:40.388 --> 07:41.788
Don't.

07:41.789 --> 07:44.691
Just don't.

07:44.692 --> 07:46.460
Why does this have
to happen now?

07:46.461 --> 07:49.396
I mean, just when things are
going so great with Don.

07:49.397 --> 07:51.298
(sighs)
It's the never-ending battle

07:51.299 --> 07:53.700
of my life:
Career versus romance.

07:53.701 --> 07:56.603
(laughs):
"Never-ending battle"?

07:56.604 --> 07:58.972
Career has been
trouncing romance for years.

07:58.973 --> 08:00.040
It's like the Globetrotters

08:00.041 --> 08:01.675
versus the Generals.

08:01.676 --> 08:03.510
Career's sinking hook shots
from half court,

08:03.511 --> 08:05.412
Romance is just
a bunch of slow white guys

08:05.413 --> 08:07.247
who couldn't make it
in the Italian league.

08:07.248 --> 08:08.248
(sighs)

08:08.249 --> 08:10.684
Ted, I'm lost.

08:11.386 --> 08:12.586
What should I do?

08:12.587 --> 08:15.789
Okay, you seriously need
to talk to Don about this.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.525
I'm just too confused
to put this on Don.

08:18.526 --> 08:21.828
I need to leave him out of it
until I figure out what I want.

08:21.829 --> 08:23.664
That makes sense.
Yeah.

08:23.665 --> 08:25.899
And I'm sorry I can't give you
better advice on this.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.135
The truth is,
it's impossible for me

08:28.136 --> 08:30.470
to be objective
about you moving away.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.576
Mm. Did you get a manicure?

08:35.577 --> 08:37.177
No, I didn't get a...

08:37.178 --> 08:38.412
He sure did.

08:38.413 --> 08:40.480
Flo!

08:40.481 --> 08:42.649
Why are you brunette
and driving a cab?

08:42.650 --> 08:43.750
Oh, that.

08:43.751 --> 08:45.686
You know how
it's my dream to have sex

08:45.687 --> 08:48.088
with at least one woman from
every country on the planet?

08:48.089 --> 08:49.289
Sure.

08:51.259 --> 08:52.993
Wow.

08:52.994 --> 08:54.061
You're doing surprisingly well

08:54.062 --> 08:55.228
in the Baltics.
Mm-hmm.

08:55.229 --> 08:56.363
So, I figure,

08:56.364 --> 08:57.397
what's the quickest way

08:57.398 --> 08:59.499
to get around the world
in 180 lays?

08:59.500 --> 09:01.868
Lease a cab and wait outside
the U.N. building

09:01.869 --> 09:02.970
for hot foreign chicks.

09:02.971 --> 09:04.771
<i>It was the perfect plan.</i>

09:04.772 --> 09:08.575
<i>There was only one small detail
I didn't take into account.</i>

09:08.576 --> 09:09.710
Chicks don't want
to bang cab drivers.

09:09.711 --> 09:11.979
Chicks do not want
to bang cab drivers!

09:11.980 --> 09:14.381
And I put a lot of
work into this one.

09:14.382 --> 09:16.917
I can't believe this.

09:16.918 --> 09:19.720
Now I got to tell Lily The Fifth
Doppelganger is a fake.

09:19.721 --> 09:21.154
So? What does she care?

09:21.155 --> 09:25.192
Lily decided that once
we spotted your doppelganger,

09:25.193 --> 09:26.793
we'd start trying to have kids.

09:26.794 --> 09:28.261
Kids?! No!

09:28.262 --> 09:29.463
Uh-uh!

09:29.464 --> 09:32.232
The rule is: no kids
until you're at least 45!

09:32.233 --> 09:34.534
Do you ever read my blog?!

09:34.535 --> 09:37.237
It's gotten a lot better.

09:37.238 --> 09:39.940
I'm ready to be a dad, you know?

09:39.941 --> 09:44.311
But Lily needs some sign
from the universe.

09:44.312 --> 09:46.213
And now it could be years.

09:46.214 --> 09:48.749
I'm sorry, buddy.

09:50.051 --> 09:51.718
That'll be $37.50.

09:51.719 --> 09:53.020
<i>NARRATOR:
So that night,</i>

09:53.021 --> 09:56.123
<i>Marshall went home
to break the bad news to Lily.</i>

09:56.124 --> 09:58.125
The universe has spoken.

09:58.126 --> 10:01.762
Marshall Eriksen,
let's make a baby.

10:02.597 --> 10:04.297
I...

10:05.566 --> 10:07.434
Okay.

10:07.435 --> 10:08.969
(both moaning)

10:10.471 --> 10:11.805
Hey.
Hey.

10:11.806 --> 10:16.076
(laughing hysterically)

10:18.012 --> 10:20.280
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

10:20.281 --> 10:22.282
I heard you were doing this,
so I worked on some stuff.

10:22.283 --> 10:24.251
Uh, hey, uh, I'm planning
a "White Wedding."

10:24.252 --> 10:26.620
Tell me, Billy Idol,
is it a nice day for that?

10:26.621 --> 10:27.621
(chuckles)

10:27.622 --> 10:29.222
Some other Billy Idol ones.

10:29.223 --> 10:30.457
Um, if anyone's looking for

10:30.458 --> 10:32.459
the real Slim Shady,
he's right here.

10:33.261 --> 10:34.428
That one's only okay.

10:34.429 --> 10:36.530
Robin, why aren't you
getting in on this?

10:36.531 --> 10:39.266
Okay, first of all,
I'm getting tons of compliments.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.868
Second of all, tell him.

10:41.869 --> 10:43.270
He's not getting
tons of compliments.

10:43.271 --> 10:44.471
No, the other thing.

10:44.472 --> 10:45.639
ROBIN:
Oh.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.142
I might move to
Chicago next week.

10:51.312 --> 10:53.313
Mm, um, hey, baby.

10:53.314 --> 10:54.214
Hmm?

10:54.215 --> 10:56.550
Not for nothing or nothing,

10:56.551 --> 10:58.685
but we'd still be doing this

10:58.686 --> 11:00.887
even if we hadn't seen
Doppelganger Barney, right?

11:00.888 --> 11:02.456
Ooh, but we did see him,

11:02.457 --> 11:05.225
which means the universe--
in all its infinite wisdom--

11:05.226 --> 11:07.327
is telling you to stick me

11:07.328 --> 11:09.096
and stick me real good.

11:09.097 --> 11:13.366
I can't. I can't in good
conscience stick you.

11:13.367 --> 11:16.970
(sighs)
I know what's bothering you.

11:16.971 --> 11:18.004
Really?

11:18.005 --> 11:20.073
The cabbages didn't look

11:20.074 --> 11:21.475
enough like Barney.

11:21.476 --> 11:25.178
Well, that's just not true.

11:25.179 --> 11:26.680
No! Time-out!

11:26.681 --> 11:28.248
This is a group decision!

11:28.249 --> 11:31.885
You can't just move to Chicago
unless we all say it's okay.

11:31.886 --> 11:33.854
Barney, I think
this has to be Robin's...

11:33.855 --> 11:35.455
Stay out of this,
Brigitte Nielsen

11:35.456 --> 11:37.824
<i>or Dolph Lundgren
from Rocky IV!</i>

11:37.825 --> 11:39.559
We need Marshall and Lily.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.595
That cabbie was like
a foot shorter than Barney!

11:41.596 --> 11:43.330
He was the exact same size!

11:43.331 --> 11:45.665
And you know what?
I think he was Asian.

11:45.666 --> 11:48.568
Yeah, that guy was like
a tiny, graying Asian man

11:48.569 --> 11:50.637
WI-with a soul patch
and a potbelly.

11:50.638 --> 11:52.639
Have you completely forgotten
what Barney looks like?!

11:52.640 --> 11:54.508
You guys banging?
(Marshall and Lily scream)

11:54.509 --> 11:56.243
Why are you in our bedroom?

11:57.011 --> 11:57.911
(both scream)

11:57.912 --> 11:59.279
<i>Why are you
in our bedroom?</i>

11:59.280 --> 12:01.281
(both scream)
Why is Ellen DeGeneres

12:01.282 --> 12:02.516
in our bedroom?

12:02.517 --> 12:06.520
(both chuckling)
Hey, this is working!

12:06.521 --> 12:09.356
Wait a minute.

12:09.357 --> 12:10.757
Candles...

12:10.758 --> 12:12.425
Flowers...

12:12.426 --> 12:15.996
Oh, I guess Marshall
"forgot" to tell you.

12:15.997 --> 12:17.964
The Fifth Doppelganger...

12:17.965 --> 12:19.132
was me.

12:19.133 --> 12:22.235
What? Wait, and you
knew about this?

12:22.236 --> 12:23.403
You lied to me?

12:23.404 --> 12:24.771
By omission,
and it's only because

12:24.772 --> 12:26.406
this whole "leave it
to the universe" thing

12:26.407 --> 12:27.741
of yours is insane, Lily.

12:27.742 --> 12:30.210
Baby, you... Lily, we need to
be in control of our own...

12:30.211 --> 12:33.180
Guys, guys! We're forgetting
what's really important here.

12:33.181 --> 12:36.316
Ted's blond.
(all chuckling)

12:36.317 --> 12:39.252
Guys, I am pulling this off.

12:40.121 --> 12:41.288
Now, Robin has something

12:41.289 --> 12:42.322
important to tell you.

12:42.323 --> 12:43.456
He's not pulling it off.

12:43.457 --> 12:44.858
No, the other thing.

12:44.859 --> 12:45.926
He got a manicure.

12:45.927 --> 12:47.460
The other thing.

12:48.329 --> 12:50.964
I got a job offer in Chicago.

12:50.965 --> 12:52.766
Whoa.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.668
That's why we all
came down here--

12:54.669 --> 12:56.870
to try and talk Robin
out of making a huge...

12:56.871 --> 12:59.573
Actually, I-I've, I've
already made a decision.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.276
(sighs) Guys, I gotta take it.

13:10.007 --> 13:12.042
I can't believe
we're losing Robin.

13:13.844 --> 13:16.579
<i>Guys, this might be
the depression talking,</i>

13:16.580 --> 13:19.149
<i>but is Ted's hair starting
to look kind of good?</i>

13:19.150 --> 13:21.684
<i>Thank God, I thought
I was the only one!</i>

13:21.685 --> 13:24.954
<i>He looks like
a freakin' movie star!</i>

13:24.955 --> 13:27.290
Oh, and by the way,
this was a huge mistake.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.992
I'm changing my hair back.

13:28.993 --> 13:31.094
Smart.
Told ya.

13:31.095 --> 13:32.729
Not at all awesome.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.164
Hey.

13:34.165 --> 13:35.331
Hey.
Hey.

13:35.332 --> 13:38.935
So, I just got off the phone
with Chicago.

13:38.936 --> 13:40.937
Yes, I have made a decision.

13:40.938 --> 13:43.139
Um...

13:47.778 --> 13:51.214
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't take the job.

13:51.215 --> 13:53.149
Thanks.

13:53.150 --> 13:54.384
I'm staying.

13:54.385 --> 13:55.618
Damn straight!
Yay!

13:55.619 --> 13:57.921
(all exclaiming)

13:57.922 --> 13:59.289
Robin!

14:01.425 --> 14:02.459
Hey, Lily,

14:02.460 --> 14:03.893
tell me something.

14:03.894 --> 14:06.729
When you saw actual Barney
driving that cab,

14:06.730 --> 14:10.033
and you thought he was a petite,
potbellied Asian man?

14:10.034 --> 14:11.668
I know. Weird, right?

14:11.669 --> 14:12.702
It's not weird.

14:12.703 --> 14:15.104
It means you're not ready.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.774
And I'm... I'm sorry
that I tried to rush things.

14:18.709 --> 14:19.843
Our baby can wait

14:19.844 --> 14:21.144
for the real Doppelganger
Barney.

14:21.145 --> 14:22.345
Oh...

14:25.216 --> 14:26.449
Mm.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.451
Mm.

14:33.224 --> 14:35.859
(mimics Monty):
Hey, Moo-Moo.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.694
Monty made you
thin-crust pizza

14:37.695 --> 14:38.995
just the way you like it!

14:38.996 --> 14:41.731
Hi.
Mmm...

14:41.732 --> 14:43.166
You okay?

14:43.167 --> 14:46.102
Robin, you're not gonna
believe this.

14:46.103 --> 14:50.240
I got offered the lead anchor
job at WNKW in Chicago.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.977
Oh.

14:53.978 --> 14:57.313
Um, what'd you say?

14:59.283 --> 15:00.650
I said yes.

15:02.086 --> 15:05.388
I've been waiting years
for a shot like this.

15:11.428 --> 15:12.595
Barney?

15:12.596 --> 15:14.931
(Estonian accent):
I am simple street performer

15:14.932 --> 15:16.533
from Estonia.

15:16.534 --> 15:18.401
Who is this Barney?

15:18.402 --> 15:20.136
Oh, he's just this guy we know

15:20.137 --> 15:21.838
who has, like,
a really lame blog.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.107
I hear it's getting better.

15:24.108 --> 15:26.476
I mean, wha-what is "blog"?

15:26.477 --> 15:28.978
It's just something that was
cool, like, eight years ago.

15:28.979 --> 15:31.614
Still cool.
Still sounds pretty cool, man.

15:31.615 --> 15:32.582
What's your name?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.517
Kristof.
Kristof what?

15:36.287 --> 15:37.820
Kristof...

15:37.821 --> 15:39.656
Doppelganger.

15:39.657 --> 15:40.957
Really?
Yep.

15:40.958 --> 15:42.225
You're gonna go with

15:42.226 --> 15:43.760
the last name (mimics
accent): "Doppelganger"?

15:43.761 --> 15:44.761
That's my name, man.

15:44.762 --> 15:47.330
Bro...

15:47.331 --> 15:49.299
Robin, wait. Please
try to understand.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.767
I gotta get out of here.

15:50.768 --> 15:52.168
Wait. Put yourself
in my shoes.

15:52.169 --> 15:54.170
Can you imagine what it's like
to have the phone ring,

15:54.171 --> 15:56.039
and it's your dream job
on the other end?

15:56.040 --> 16:00.310
Yes... I can.

16:00.311 --> 16:04.147
(voice breaking):
Good luck in Chicago, Don.

16:08.919 --> 16:10.820
Barney, why are you doing this?

16:10.821 --> 16:11.821
(grunts)

16:11.822 --> 16:13.089
Wait a minute.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.924
Could it, could it be

16:14.925 --> 16:17.460
that Barney Stinson actually
wants us to have kids?

16:17.461 --> 16:18.962
Who is this Barney?!

16:18.963 --> 16:21.631
Take American chill pill!

16:21.632 --> 16:24.400
Well, let me tell you
about him.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.770
He talks a big game
about how no one should

16:27.771 --> 16:30.940
ever have kids before
they're at least 45.

16:30.941 --> 16:32.742
I would be interested in reading

16:32.743 --> 16:35.545
some of these opinions
in blog form.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.814
But I think I know
what happened.

16:37.815 --> 16:40.383
Yesterday, Barney thought
he had to say good-bye

16:40.384 --> 16:42.018
to someone he truly loves.

16:42.019 --> 16:43.786
And it got him thinking...

16:43.787 --> 16:46.289
Maybe it wouldn't
be the worst thing

16:46.290 --> 16:48.224
if a baby joined
our little group.

16:48.225 --> 16:51.361
Babies...

16:51.362 --> 16:53.262
<i>can be cute.</i>

16:53.263 --> 16:56.966
Mm. And someday,
he's gonna make

16:56.967 --> 16:59.002
the best uncle in the world.

16:59.003 --> 17:00.970
Because this Barney...

17:00.971 --> 17:03.206
He's family to us.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.074

17:13.751 --> 17:15.617
(Eastern-European accent):
Excuse me.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.487
I heard you're from Estonia.

17:17.488 --> 17:19.321
So am I.

17:19.323 --> 17:21.491
Excuse me one moment.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.496
<i>(normal voice, sotto voce): Estonia
would close out the Baltics!</i>

17:26.497 --> 17:30.867
And I am
street performer like you.

17:45.382 --> 17:47.083
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

17:48.185 --> 17:50.520
(knocking)

17:50.521 --> 17:51.621
Hey.

17:51.622 --> 17:54.190
Say yes to this.

17:54.191 --> 17:55.258
Okay.

17:55.259 --> 17:57.560
(voice breaking):
Can I move back in?

17:59.229 --> 18:01.664
(sniffling)

18:01.665 --> 18:03.533
Yes.

18:06.236 --> 18:08.838
But, Ted, am I just
the biggest idiot in the world?

18:08.839 --> 18:12.041
Look, think about all
of us five years ago

18:12.042 --> 18:13.776
when we first met you.

18:13.777 --> 18:16.713
<i>Marshall and Lily were just
boyfriend and girlfriend.</i>

18:16.714 --> 18:19.649
<i>Now they're married
and thinking about kids.</i>

18:19.650 --> 18:20.917
<i>And Barney?</i>

18:20.918 --> 18:23.553
<i>Barney was never gonna commit
to anyone ever.</i>

18:23.554 --> 18:27.223
And last year, he fell in love.

18:27.224 --> 18:29.225
<i>And me?</i>

18:29.226 --> 18:32.528
<i>I was chasing some girl I was
convinced was "The One."</i>

18:32.529 --> 18:35.898
Now she's one of my
closest friends.

18:35.899 --> 18:37.266
And you?

18:37.267 --> 18:40.136
<i>Five years ago, you never
would have chosen love</i>

18:40.137 --> 18:43.506
over your career,
but today you did.

18:43.507 --> 18:45.875
Looks like I'm getting dumber.
No,

18:45.876 --> 18:48.544
(sighs) just more courageous.

18:51.315 --> 18:52.482
Look, we've all been searching

18:52.483 --> 18:53.783
for The Five Doppelgangers,
right?

18:53.784 --> 18:54.784
Mm.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.452
But eventually, over time,

18:56.453 --> 18:58.821
we all become
our own doppelgangers.

18:58.822 --> 19:01.657
You know, these... these
completely different people

19:01.658 --> 19:04.761
who just happen to look like us.

19:04.762 --> 19:07.463
"Five Years Ago Robin"?

19:07.464 --> 19:10.466
That girl, she was pretty great.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.403
But Doppelganger Robin?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.973
She's amazing.

19:26.884 --> 19:30.586
We've, um, we've had
a lot to drink...

19:30.587 --> 19:32.054
I don't care.

19:34.658 --> 19:38.361
(snickering) What?

19:38.362 --> 19:40.630
(laughing)
Oh. Oh, yeah.

19:40.631 --> 19:42.465
I forgot I'm blond.

19:42.466 --> 19:44.367
I have blond hair.

19:44.368 --> 19:47.003
<i>And that's the story
of how dying my hair blond</i>

19:47.004 --> 19:48.371
<i>kept us from doing something</i>

19:48.372 --> 19:50.907
<i>we both would have regretted
that night.</i>

19:50.908 --> 19:53.943
<i>Kids, the universe is funny.</i>

20:01.952 --> 20:03.820
Oh, my God!

20:04.988 --> 20:06.656
Yes! You're here!

20:06.657 --> 20:08.057
This is fantastic!

20:08.058 --> 20:09.859
Baby, simmer.
Your husband's right there.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.327
<i>At least attempt
to hide it.</i>

20:11.328 --> 20:13.129
Guys, follow me!

20:16.133 --> 20:17.567
Guys, look!

20:17.568 --> 20:19.635
The Fifth Doppelganger!

20:23.073 --> 20:24.674
Uh, Lily?

20:24.675 --> 20:26.008
That dude looks noth...

20:26.009 --> 20:27.076
MARSHALL:
Guys...

20:27.077 --> 20:28.611
Go with it.

20:28.612 --> 20:33.049
<i>Kids, you can ask the universe
for signs all you want...</i>

20:33.050 --> 20:35.318
It's uncanny.
Right?

20:35.319 --> 20:37.320
Just like Barney.
Amazing.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.121
It's like looking
in the mirror.

20:39.122 --> 20:42.625
<i>But ultimately, we only see
what we want to see</i>

20:42.626 --> 20:44.393
<i>when we're ready to see it.</i>

20:44.394 --> 20:47.864
So, um, does this mean...?

20:47.865 --> 20:49.799
Marshall Eriksen...

20:49.800 --> 20:51.934
put a baby in my belly.

20:51.935 --> 20:54.036
Mm...

20:55.444 --> 21:05.881
