Core the pumpkin and come play.

00:03.456 --> 00:05.564
Halloween, o'happy day.

00:06.050 --> 00:09.375
Halloween o' ha-ppy day.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.985
What are you doing with Salem?
I heard him screeching.

00:13.986 --> 00:16.639
Very funny.
We were singing a Halloween carol.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.440
Yes! Happy Halloween.

00:18.441 --> 00:21.730
I bet you couldn't sleep last night with
all the excitement and anticipation?

00:21.931 --> 00:23.131
I managed.

00:23.132 --> 00:25.544
Well that's not the spirit.

00:25.645 --> 00:28.756
Halloween is our favourite holiday,
it's a magical night.

00:28.757 --> 00:30.363
Yes, sing it Zeldy.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.576
Have a jolly-olly-hollo-Halloween.

00:32.577 --> 00:33.677
Please stop singing.

00:33.678 --> 00:36.511
Look, I'm trying okay,
I'm going to school in a costume.

00:36.512 --> 00:37.712
Guess who I am?

00:39.957 --> 00:42.433
Sally Jesse Raphaël. What,
do I need a microphone?

00:42.434 --> 00:44.811
That is the lamest costume
I've ever seen.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.708
It's just a pair of glasses.

00:47.664 --> 00:49.419
There's no foolin' you.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.549
Well if you can do better,
be my guest.

00:54.318 --> 00:55.249
There.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.250
Much better.

00:56.251 --> 00:58.314
What did you do?

00:58.415 --> 01:00.004
Oh man!

01:01.758 --> 01:04.608
Next up, we are going
to talk to a teenage witch

01:04.610 --> 01:07.950
and her aunts who
take things too far.

01:09.589 --> 01:15.437
Have a jolly-olly-hollo-Halloween.

01:42.761 --> 01:43.824
Hey Sabrina,

01:44.326 --> 01:47.132
I got somethin' for you.
It's kinda last minute but here.

01:47.444 --> 01:50.235
My parents are making me have
an Halloween party.

01:50.236 --> 01:53.249
Bummer, next thing you know they'll
make you go on a ski trip.

01:53.993 --> 01:56.882
No see my Dad always buys in
bulk at these discount clubs

01:56.883 --> 01:59.412
and we got a lot of snack food
that expire in November.

01:59.413 --> 02:02.239
Oh so that's why it says all food
must be eaten by midnight.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.074
I'm thinking about
going as James Dean.

02:04.075 --> 02:05.275
I love James Dean.

02:05.276 --> 02:06.970
Yeah, and all I needs a white T shirt,

02:06.971 --> 02:08.919
some jeans and
somethin' to lean on.

02:09.452 --> 02:11.465
Anyway I was hoping
you could come early

02:11.466 --> 02:12.866
and help me set stuff up?

02:13.634 --> 02:14.917
Oh I can't.

02:17.263 --> 02:20.090
I've got a family thing. My aunts
take Halloween very seriously.

02:20.091 --> 02:21.091
I know it's weird.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.940
No, no, my mom's that
way about flag day.

02:22.941 --> 02:25.187
Well I wish I could help,
I feel really bad.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.770
I've got your invitation Harvey,
see you at eight.

02:27.771 --> 02:29.846
Unless you need me
to come early and help?

02:29.847 --> 02:31.847
- Sure.
- No problem.

02:32.305 --> 02:34.532
Hey, and now you don't
have to feel bad.

02:38.546 --> 02:40.394
Please, I have to go to Harvey's party

02:40.395 --> 02:41.395
No!

02:41.396 --> 02:43.398
What if I promise to be with
the family all thanksgiving?

02:43.399 --> 02:44.808
We're not big on thanksgiving.

02:44.809 --> 02:48.252
That holiday was started by puritans
who weren't exactly witch friendly.

02:48.695 --> 02:50.312
So instead we celebrate
a night devoted to little kids

02:50.313 --> 02:52.113
dressing up like super-hero's?

02:52.127 --> 02:55.172
That is not what
all hallows eve is all about.

02:55.173 --> 02:57.432
It's a time for remembering the dead.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.233
Oh that sounds like fun.

03:00.069 --> 03:02.118
I just know I'll have a terrible time.

03:02.119 --> 03:04.905
And that's what family
gatherings are all about.

03:04.906 --> 03:08.365
D'you think I want to listen to cousin
Marigold brag about how married she is

03:08.366 --> 03:11.006
and how single I am?
No.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.534
But we go, because it's tradition.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.361
And Zelda makes me.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.662
And now you're making me?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.263
See? Tradition.

03:18.692 --> 03:22.957
I tell you what. If we get back in time
you can still go to Harvey's party, okay?

03:22.958 --> 03:23.958
Not okay,

03:24.159 --> 03:26.258
Libby's going early, so unless
I'm there from the start

03:26.259 --> 03:28.919
I may as well go to the Other Realm
and never come back.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.753
Can I go to Harvey's party?

03:37.018 --> 03:39.844
It's so unfair, they can't make me
go to the Other Realm.

03:39.845 --> 03:43.336
They made me a cat,
you're messing with the wrong crowd.

03:43.964 --> 03:45.749
So there's no way I can go
to Harvey's party?

03:45.750 --> 03:46.936
There might be.

03:46.937 --> 03:49.937
Get your magic book,
turn to full body duplication.

03:49.996 --> 03:50.996
what's that?

03:50.997 --> 03:53.374
You can make a double who
looks and acts just like you.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.729
Perfect, I'll send my
double to the family thing.

03:55.730 --> 03:58.742
No can do, your aunts'd
spot the switch in no time.

03:58.743 --> 04:01.786
Well then my double will hold my place
until I can be with Harvey.

04:02.778 --> 04:03.778
Here goes.

04:05.688 --> 04:07.475
Double, double.
Toil and trouble.

04:07.476 --> 04:10.373
Bill Shakspere stole that
from us, what a hack.

04:10.374 --> 04:11.574
It didn't work.

04:11.575 --> 04:12.575
Step aside.

04:15.541 --> 04:17.390
Wow! Amazing.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.596
It can't talk until you
give it something to say

04:19.598 --> 04:22.551
and keep in mind it can only
say three sentences.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.482
Let me think. I want my
double to be positive

04:25.483 --> 04:28.139
because people are always feel
positive about positive people.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.337
My tuna's coming up.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.858
So let's start with...
'I'd love to.'

04:33.911 --> 04:35.125
I'd love to.

04:35.742 --> 04:40.246
Okay, and I want me to be a good listener
so let's try. 'That is so true.'

04:40.976 --> 04:42.412
That is so true.

04:42.779 --> 04:45.780
And we need a universal truth.
Oh that's easy.

04:45.909 --> 04:47.972
'Mr. Pool can be so annoying.'

04:48.741 --> 04:50.773
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.

04:51.132 --> 04:53.875
Well then I guess I'm...
we're all set,

04:54.289 --> 04:56.058
except I need a costume.

04:58.156 --> 05:00.397
Hey I look really cute.

05:00.725 --> 05:01.798
That is so true.

05:02.467 --> 05:03.499
I like me.

05:07.931 --> 05:10.153
Okay, that's Libby,
she's really annoying.

05:10.154 --> 05:11.754
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.

05:11.855 --> 05:15.657
Now your mission is to make sure she's
never alone with Harvey, okay? Go.

05:19.008 --> 05:23.158
Sabrina! You're not supposed to be here,
you are totally butting in.

05:23.159 --> 05:24.459
That is so true.

05:25.805 --> 05:30.400
Hey Libby, hi Sabrina, you made it! You know
you look really good as a witch.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.909
Harvey, did you notice
I'm dressed as Jackie O?

05:32.910 --> 05:35.369
Very classy.
D'you guys wanna come in?

05:35.370 --> 05:36.370
I'd love to.

05:36.371 --> 05:38.025
Great, Sabrina and I'll
put out the sodas

05:38.026 --> 05:40.325
and Jackie you can fill
the bath tub with cheesits.

05:42.256 --> 05:43.890
Yes! I'm in.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.353
Come on you three,

05:46.454 --> 05:49.472
even with instantaneous
transport we're going to be late.

05:49.873 --> 05:51.734
Coming. Coming.

05:51.735 --> 05:54.285
Salem, you look adorable.

05:54.286 --> 05:56.892
I feel like a Chippendale's cat.

05:57.577 --> 05:58.466
Okay, I'm ready.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.231
You are not going dressed like that.

06:00.232 --> 06:01.632
Well then I guess I'm not going.

06:01.633 --> 06:04.547
Sabrina! I know you have
something more appropriate.

06:04.648 --> 06:05.848
What about this.

06:07.336 --> 06:09.679
Please, I only wore this dress
to make Granny happy,

06:09.680 --> 06:11.280
now she's passed away
I'm done with it.

06:11.281 --> 06:13.507
Oh come on, it looks sweet on you.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.311
That's what Granny used to say.

06:16.512 --> 06:18.112
Lets get this show on the road.

06:18.113 --> 06:19.313
You look nice Hilda.

06:19.314 --> 06:21.465
- Pass the potato's
- Someone's in a hurry.

06:21.466 --> 06:23.266
- Happy Halloween.
- Hold on.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.842
What colour is my dress?

06:25.843 --> 06:27.043
Pass the potato's.

06:27.244 --> 06:31.132
Hilda! you are in Big trouble.

06:32.009 --> 06:33.839
Stupid double.

06:36.728 --> 06:37.737
Lets go.

06:39.447 --> 06:41.839
Am I the only one looking
forward to this?

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
Yes.

06:49.237 --> 06:50.682
Are we there yet?

06:55.111 --> 06:58.082
Wow! No wonder my ears
popped on the way up.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.776
Oh the Earth looks so full tonight.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.387
Zelda!

07:02.388 --> 07:03.388
Marigold.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.889
And Hilda.

07:05.651 --> 07:08.151
That outfit always looks
so nice on you.

07:08.152 --> 07:09.352
Thank's... wait!

07:10.319 --> 07:12.867
I see you've brought your cat
but no dates?

07:12.868 --> 07:15.394
No Marigold,
we're still not married.

07:15.395 --> 07:17.195
Don't,
I'll cry.

07:18.311 --> 07:20.819
Oh and this must be Sabrina.

07:21.051 --> 07:24.711
I'd heard you'd gone to live
with your aunts, is it okay?

07:24.712 --> 07:25.912
Yes, it's fine.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.164
We love having her with us.

07:28.165 --> 07:32.176
Well a niece, it's almost like
having a daughter.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.387
My little girl, Amanda,
is right here.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.390
You get to sit with her.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.270
Oh goody,
we can talk about dolls.

07:41.092 --> 07:43.582
Zelda, Hilda,
you'll sit with me

07:43.872 --> 07:45.923
and Salem
you'll be with the cat.

07:45.924 --> 07:46.924
Swell.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.928
You can all take your seats,
I'll check on the consommé

07:49.929 --> 07:52.204
or as Hilda would call it, soup.

07:55.071 --> 07:56.339
What's wrong with soup?

07:56.340 --> 07:59.613
Don't start. Oh look, uncle Noonie.
Here Sabrina.

07:59.814 --> 08:00.739
Uncle Noonie!

08:01.262 --> 08:02.729
UNCLE NOONIE!

08:02.835 --> 08:04.640
I can't believe I have to sit
at the kiddie table.

08:04.641 --> 08:06.829
I can't believe I have to sit
at the kitty table. Wait,

08:06.830 --> 08:09.958
gimme a sec,
M'lady's here.

08:10.059 --> 08:11.259
Who's that?

08:11.260 --> 08:15.863
Marigold's pet, she thinks her litter box
doesn't stink and what a lush.

08:16.848 --> 08:20.076
Oh catnip,
don't mind if I do.

08:20.077 --> 08:21.477
Okay, here we go.

08:21.578 --> 08:22.978
Hello Salem.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.579
Hello M'Lady.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.437
Hi Amanda,
I'm your cousin, Sabrina.

08:27.639 --> 08:30.460
You better be nice to me
or I'll put you in a jar.

08:30.661 --> 08:31.661
Excuse me?

08:31.662 --> 08:34.171
I put all the people who
aren't nice to me in jars.

08:34.395 --> 08:37.255
This is Mr. Altree,

08:37.256 --> 08:38.456
he tried to teach me math.

08:38.657 --> 08:39.857
Can he breath in there?

08:39.957 --> 08:42.385
Yes, I gave him air holes.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.630
Here's a math problem Mr. Altree,

08:44.631 --> 08:47.717
five air holes minus
one air hole is how many?

08:47.718 --> 08:50.161
No, please!
I wanna live.

08:51.651 --> 08:53.106
I wanna live!

08:53.207 --> 08:55.412
See, nobody likes pop quizzes.

08:56.413 --> 08:57.647
Do you wanna put someone in a jar?

08:57.648 --> 09:01.217
No, my aunts taught me it's not nice
to use magic to hurt other people.

09:01.218 --> 09:05.834
Well my parents let me use magic any time I want
and I don't even have to ask.

09:06.376 --> 09:08.236
- Brat.
- What was that?

09:08.337 --> 09:09.537
Nothing.

09:10.313 --> 09:12.312
Why do I have to sit by myself,

09:12.313 --> 09:14.013
can't I move over one seat?

09:14.014 --> 09:16.846
No, I'm saving this for my husband.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.973
Poor Harold's been
working so much these days

09:18.974 --> 09:22.401
I'm not sure he'll make it but someone's
got to bring home the basudo.

09:22.902 --> 09:24.302
What's wrong with bacon?

09:24.503 --> 09:27.104
- Aunt Zelda, can we go yet?
- Sabrina we just got here.

09:27.105 --> 09:30.340
Don't you walk away from me,
I wanna braid your hair.

09:39.937 --> 09:41.410
Did anyone eat anything?

09:41.764 --> 09:43.771
Deany took a handful of pretzels.

09:43.772 --> 09:45.372
Great, I'd better refill.

09:47.493 --> 09:49.537
Isn't the music kind of loud Harvey?

09:49.738 --> 09:51.938
I don't know,
the neighbours haven't complained.

09:53.649 --> 09:56.272
I'd better go check that out.
Hey, turn it down.

10:02.191 --> 10:03.554
Will you leave me alone?

10:09.669 --> 10:11.702
Would you stop smiling at me!

10:11.803 --> 10:13.803
Oh you are such a goody two shoes.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.404
That is so true.

10:17.271 --> 10:18.720
Well at least you admit it.

10:19.014 --> 10:21.459
Y'know I'd like you a lot more
if you'd just make fun of people

10:21.460 --> 10:23.501
but I suppose you would never do that.

10:23.702 --> 10:25.702
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.

10:26.931 --> 10:28.391
That's a start.

10:30.008 --> 10:31.792
You're going to ruin your dinner.

10:32.193 --> 10:34.601
My parents let me eat
ice cream whenever I want,

10:34.602 --> 10:37.321
my nanny said it would rot
my teeth so I put her in a jar.

10:37.322 --> 10:39.968
You know you should really find
other ways of dealing with people.

10:39.969 --> 10:41.569
What's that supposed to mean?

10:41.570 --> 10:45.030
Just that, you know you don't have
to put everyone you don't like in a jar.

10:45.031 --> 10:48.677
That's what my psychologist said,
so I put him in a jar.

10:49.283 --> 10:50.178
Brat.

10:50.179 --> 10:51.579
I heard that one.

10:52.536 --> 10:54.233
Slow down M'Lady.

10:54.234 --> 10:56.454
Hey! I can handle it.

10:58.678 --> 11:01.540
And that's Harold
and me in front of our villa.

11:02.056 --> 11:04.543
You know if either one of you
ever has a honeymoon

11:04.544 --> 11:07.424
you really must take it in
the south of France.

11:07.888 --> 11:11.173
On second thoughts don't wait,
I wouldn't want you to miss out.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.999
Excuse me,
I'm in no hurry to get married.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.549
That's right, Hilda is single
completely by choice

11:17.550 --> 11:21.598
because she refuses to settle for any of
the losers she's been dating.

11:22.735 --> 11:24.383
And Zelda,
what's your excuse?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.075
Zelda doesn't need an excuse,

11:26.076 --> 11:28.261
she's passionate about
her intellectual pursuits.

11:28.262 --> 11:30.314
Her love life is all in her head.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.792
Mommy, look what I did.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.793
Is that Sabrina!

11:33.894 --> 11:35.094
What did you do to her?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.495
She wouldn't colour with me.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.553
Oh, that is so cute.

11:39.822 --> 11:43.356
Can we please go home now?,
I'm really not having any fun.

11:43.754 --> 11:47.019
I'll colour with you Amanda,
please let me out.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.102
I chose Jackie because,

11:49.103 --> 11:52.659
well I sort of see myself as the
first lady of Westbridge High.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.060
That is so true.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.061
Thanks.

11:58.729 --> 12:01.559
This party is dying,
we've gotta do something.

12:02.060 --> 12:04.867
Oh man, the onion dip is bubbling.

12:06.506 --> 12:08.737
What this party needs

12:08.738 --> 12:11.793
is something big,
something wild.

12:12.454 --> 12:16.820
I know, someone should streak.
It's fun, it's fast, it's naked.

12:17.255 --> 12:18.321
I'd love to.

12:18.922 --> 12:20.929
- You'd streak? 
- I'd love to.

12:21.230 --> 12:25.438
Sabrina, this is a whole new you.

12:28.701 --> 12:32.721
Man this party's boring,
I'd leave if it weren't mine.

12:32.722 --> 12:35.771
Harvey, I've got it taken care of.
Sabrina's going to streak.

12:35.772 --> 12:37.172
What!
You're kidding?

12:37.352 --> 12:40.759
Sabrina, look I appreciate
you trying to help out my party

12:40.760 --> 12:42.560
but streaking is never the answer.

12:42.731 --> 12:45.009
Don't you know you'd be teased for
the rest of high school?

12:45.287 --> 12:46.510
That is so true.

12:46.611 --> 12:48.011
Then why are you doing it?

12:48.112 --> 12:50.189
Mr. Pool can be so annoying.

12:50.190 --> 12:51.982
Don't change the subject.

12:51.983 --> 12:55.229
Look, this isn't like you,
why are you acting so weird?

12:55.530 --> 12:57.130
I'd... that... Mr...

12:57.131 --> 13:00.749
I can't even talk to you,
I feel so alienated.

13:02.719 --> 13:06.721
Salem, you're the only one
who understands me.

13:06.722 --> 13:09.310
Yeah, but it
doesn't mean I care.

13:10.481 --> 13:12.102
Dinners over, can we go now?

13:12.303 --> 13:14.892
We got you out of the jar,
stop whining.

13:15.368 --> 13:17.641
Alright everyone,
Time to open presents.

13:18.282 --> 13:20.215
Amanda darling, you go first.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.416
It better be good.

13:21.517 --> 13:24.793
There's nothing like watching Halloween
through the eyes of a spoiled child.

13:25.294 --> 13:28.730
A solid gold dolly,
thank you mommy.

13:28.731 --> 13:31.349
It's from mommy and daddy.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.050
We got Sabrina something too.

13:33.051 --> 13:34.251
Oh here you go.

13:34.352 --> 13:36.579
- It's from both of us.
- Happy Halloween.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.072
Oh, a nice card.
Kids love those.

13:39.749 --> 13:43.150
It's a gift certificate to spend half an hour
with the deceased of your choice.

13:43.151 --> 13:44.151
What's this?

13:44.152 --> 13:48.209
You got her a reanimation?
Those are very pricey.

13:48.210 --> 13:51.886
I want a reanimation!
I want a reanimation!

13:51.887 --> 13:54.351
I WANT A REANIMATION!

13:56.581 --> 13:58.666
This is the weirdest gift,
what do I do with it?

13:58.667 --> 13:59.867
It's yours to spend as you like.

13:59.868 --> 14:01.474
But you must use it tonight,

14:01.475 --> 14:04.564
the gap between the living and the dead
is weakest on all hallows eve

14:04.565 --> 14:06.262
Well then maybe one
of you should use it.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.141
You know I really just wanna
get back to Harvey's party

14:08.142 --> 14:09.542
and see him dressed like James Dean.

14:09.843 --> 14:11.533
Why not meet the real James Dean?

14:11.734 --> 14:12.934
I could do that?!

14:13.979 --> 14:15.215
How does it work?

14:15.616 --> 14:17.914
Now you just fill in the name
of who you wanna see

14:17.915 --> 14:19.715
and put it through that mail-slot.

14:20.016 --> 14:21.803
Now how do I know I'm going
to get the real James Dean

14:21.804 --> 14:23.404
and not the sausage guy?

14:23.605 --> 14:26.014
First of all,
the sausage guy is still alive

14:26.015 --> 14:29.268
but just in case write
'Star of Rebel without a cause.'

14:29.869 --> 14:31.069
This is so great.

14:32.592 --> 14:35.391
Wait, I have a better idea.

14:39.688 --> 14:40.727
There.

14:45.047 --> 14:46.488
- Now what?
- We leave,

14:46.689 --> 14:49.186
This is your own personal,
private moment.

14:49.187 --> 14:50.387
- Who did you chose?
- Hilda!

15:05.252 --> 15:06.492
Sabrina!

15:07.787 --> 15:08.996
Granny?

15:10.097 --> 15:11.731
I missed you so much.

15:11.732 --> 15:13.332
Oh I've missed you too.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.847
Oh let me take a look at you,

15:16.248 --> 15:18.888
you look so sweet in that dress.

15:21.307 --> 15:24.836
That was a lovely gift.
Harold gave me this.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.237
I picked it out myself.

15:26.438 --> 15:27.638
Which reminds me.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.839
Hilda, I got you a little something.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.691
Zelda! You said we weren't going
to exchange gifts this year.

15:33.692 --> 15:35.875
I know but I couldn't help myself.

15:35.876 --> 15:36.876
Me neither.

15:37.414 --> 15:40.039
Thank God you have each other.

15:42.579 --> 15:45.275
We've been living together way too long.

15:45.821 --> 15:49.122
Meow! give that back, I know when
I've had enough catnip.

15:49.123 --> 15:52.215
Oh no, the cat's sauced again.

15:52.970 --> 15:55.770
Why does one of our relatives
always have to get drunk?

15:56.022 --> 15:59.268
You are not going to believe
what M'Lady just blurted out.

15:59.269 --> 16:01.093
- What?
- Come close.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.379
Marigold and Harold are getting a divorce.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.839
I don't belive it,
Marigold is splitting up with Harold?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.440
Oh, this is the best Halloween ever.

16:09.612 --> 16:11.616
So I moved in with
aunt Hilda and aunt Zelda,

16:11.857 --> 16:15.187
they do more weird things by nine a.m.
than most people do all day.

16:15.618 --> 16:16.888
They take really good care of me.

16:16.889 --> 16:18.584
I always liked them.

16:18.973 --> 16:22.366
So tell me, how's school,
do you still like science?

16:22.467 --> 16:25.290
Yeah, my teacher, Mr. Pool,
can be so annoying

16:25.642 --> 16:27.247
but he's actually a good guy.

16:27.248 --> 16:28.848
Do you have a boyfriend yet?

16:29.518 --> 16:32.092
There's a guy I like,
his names Harvey

16:32.757 --> 16:34.622
but right now we're just sorta friends.

16:34.623 --> 16:37.828
Oh well he'd be a fool
if he doesn't fall for you.

16:37.829 --> 16:39.441
You think I'm the prettiest girl in the world.

16:39.442 --> 16:42.452
That's because are,
and smart too.

16:42.553 --> 16:43.988
Thanks, but

16:44.489 --> 16:46.406
Granny there's something
I want to tell you only,

16:46.407 --> 16:48.713
well it's kinda strange.

16:48.814 --> 16:51.892
Well Sabrina, you know
you can always tell me anything.

16:53.484 --> 16:54.734
I'm a witch.

16:56.097 --> 16:59.440
Well dear,
as long as you're happy.

17:03.214 --> 17:04.664
Clock's ticking.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.787
Why don't you go outside
and find a place to strip.

17:06.788 --> 17:07.788
I'd love to.

17:07.888 --> 17:11.194
You know Sabrina, you're new 'do
what I say' attitude is really great.

17:12.602 --> 17:13.888
Pay attention everyone.

17:14.115 --> 17:16.700
Midnight is fifteen minutes away

17:16.501 --> 17:18.601
and I think you should all pay
attention to those windows.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.048
Why, Did the Kinkle's put
on some cheesy ghost show?

17:21.049 --> 17:24.131
No, but watch closely
and you might see a full moon.

17:24.332 --> 17:28.151
M'Lady also said that Marigold
went to the south of France alone.

17:28.152 --> 17:29.752
But we saw Harold in the pictures?

17:29.753 --> 17:31.153
That was a cardboard cut out.

17:32.182 --> 17:33.257
I'm back.

17:33.425 --> 17:34.850
Oh, how was it?

17:34.851 --> 17:37.577
It was an amazing gift.
I got to see my Granny again

17:37.578 --> 17:39.833
and tell her everything's okay.
Thanks aunt Zelda.

17:41.029 --> 17:42.256
Thanks aunt Hilda.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.462
We're glad you liked it.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.063
And now it's time to leave.

17:46.338 --> 17:48.830
Amanda darling,
When someone gives you a gift

17:48.831 --> 17:50.256
you're supposed to say thank you.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.648
Fine.
Thank you.

17:54.645 --> 17:57.311
Now that's verging on rude.

17:59.306 --> 18:01.947
We've come to say good bye
and to thank you,

18:01.948 --> 18:04.834
you've made our evening
in so many ways.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.435
We hope it wasn't too stressful.

18:06.436 --> 18:10.097
You know planning the party,
preparing the food, divorcing Harold.

18:10.098 --> 18:11.498
No the... what!

18:12.189 --> 18:15.067
Oh we know all about it,
the cat blabbed

18:15.168 --> 18:17.762
but don't worry,
you'll love being alone.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.808
Filling your days with romance novels.
lean cuisines, internet chat rooms.

18:22.170 --> 18:25.810
Oh God,
I'm going to be just like you.

18:27.088 --> 18:28.983
Oh Hilda, we've made her cry.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.479
Oh how awful we
must feel. Let's go.

18:33.594 --> 18:35.161
You know,
I really had a good time.

18:35.162 --> 18:36.962
- Me too.
- Me three.

18:37.593 --> 18:39.847
I told you family gatherings were fun.

18:40.385 --> 18:44.813
It's still better to be
a divorcee than a spinster,

18:45.394 --> 18:47.054
Ah stuff it!

18:48.565 --> 18:51.366
Mommy, I'm hungry.
I want a hamburger.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.167
Not now dear,
it's not a good time.

18:53.268 --> 18:57.006
But I want it now!
NOW! NOW! NOW!...

18:58.473 --> 19:00.772
I think somebody needs a time out.

19:01.597 --> 19:05.123
You'll be sorry, I'm telling daddy
where you've hid the silver.

19:05.832 --> 19:07.100
Oh really!

19:08.986 --> 19:11.253
Whoa, what happened
to Harvey's party?

19:11.436 --> 19:13.873
Oh I decided to stay in and
read some of Granny's letters.

19:13.874 --> 19:17.006
Are you nuts? You can't
leave a double running around.

19:17.007 --> 19:19.706
Oh I forgot. I gotta change!

19:21.591 --> 19:23.824
Oh wait, I'm a witch.

19:25.942 --> 19:28.516
Now I've got your clothes,
I'll wait for you on the other side.

19:28.717 --> 19:29.917
Count to ten.

19:32.274 --> 19:34.767
Ten...nine...eight...

19:34.768 --> 19:37.112
seven...six...

19:37.247 --> 19:39.070
- Oops, I'm already here.
- five... four... 

19:39.371 --> 19:42.196
Three... two... one.

19:43.844 --> 19:45.091
Hey, what's everyone looking at?

19:45.092 --> 19:47.509
Sabrina's gonna streak.
There she is.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.849
I can't believe Sabrina did that.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.050
I didn't.

19:56.810 --> 19:57.931
That wasn't me.

19:57.932 --> 19:59.871
- Sabrina, you're here!
- Yeah, where else would I be?

20:00.072 --> 20:02.289
I knew Libby couldn't
make you streak,

20:03.014 --> 20:04.173
but then who was that?

20:04.174 --> 20:07.202
I don't see Libby anywhere,
I guess it must have been her.

20:07.403 --> 20:10.826
That was Libby? Hey everybody,
that was Libby streaking.

20:13.934 --> 20:15.283
Wasn't that fun?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.627
I'm glad you all enjoyed it.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.378
How'd you get in here so quick?

20:21.379 --> 20:23.011
What are you talking about?
I've been here the whole time.

20:23.012 --> 20:24.612
I just gave you your clothes outside.

20:24.613 --> 20:27.562
Oh give it up Libby, we all know
you're the one who streaked.

20:27.563 --> 20:28.663
I did not!

20:28.664 --> 20:31.014
Yes you did,
we saw your butt.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.984
That was not me.
You are all so immature.

20:40.025 --> 20:42.875
Well my aunts were right,
Halloween is a magical night.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.815
Now I know I blew up at you before

20:44.816 --> 20:46.888
but do you think you could stay
late and help me clean up?

20:47.089 --> 20:48.119
I'd love to...

20:48.786 --> 20:50.560
I mean I'd really enjoy that

20:50.813 --> 20:52.453
but first I've got to get some fresh air.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.944
Hey I don't blame you,

20:54.945 --> 20:58.027
those expiration dates are a lot
more precise that you'd think.

20:58.412 --> 21:00.283
Sabrina, Sabrina!

21:01.854 --> 21:04.076
Hey look at you, you put
your dress on backwards,

21:04.653 --> 21:06.904
man I'm a mess. Come on,
let's get it together.

21:10.835 --> 21:13.076
Great everything's back to normal...

21:13.277 --> 21:16.312
That is so true... weird!

21:20.462 --> 21:24.718
Hi, I'd like to take half a minute to talk to you
about the true meaning of Halloween.

21:24.976 --> 21:27.039
It's not about candy and costumes,

21:27.040 --> 21:29.286
it's about family and showing
them how much you care.

21:29.387 --> 21:32.179
So don't buy into the hype and
commercialisation of the season.

21:32.530 --> 21:35.022
This Halloween,
stay home with your loved ones.

21:35.023 --> 21:37.483
Just gather round the
jack-o-lantern and remember,

21:37.484 --> 21:40.806
