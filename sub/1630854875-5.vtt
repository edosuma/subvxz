09:22.979 --> 09:26.066
and the sun won't shine
as brightly,

09:26.107 --> 09:29.903
and the moon will not be
so moon-y.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.324
Patty: And here he is playing
with his favorite toy,

09:34.366 --> 09:35.950
Mr. Bear-Bear.

09:35.992 --> 09:40.246
And here he is the year he went
as French toast for Halloween.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.957
Oh, well,
that's just precious.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.294
Oh, and this was the first day
we brought him home.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.295
Who's that?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.798
Oh, Patrick, my ex.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.759
We were still married
when Hank came into my life.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.096
Turns out the dog
would outlive our marriage.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.433
Hank was my rock.

10:00.475 --> 10:05.355
Patty, I am -- I'm truly sorry
for your loss, but --

10:05.397 --> 10:08.274
what prompted you to hire
a private investigator?

10:08.316 --> 10:12.237
My Hank was murdered, and I
need you to find out who did it.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.405
I beg your pardon?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.074
That dog was in perfect health
when he died,

10:16.116 --> 10:19.202
so I asked the vet
to determine the case of death.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.705
And they found
something suspicious?

10:21.746 --> 10:25.417
Early stage chemical burns
in his mouth.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.879
The vet thinks he ingested
a highly concentrated toxin.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.590
So you think he was
intentionally poisoned?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.800
I know he was.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.302
Look, I keep a very close eye
on Hank.

10:36.344 --> 10:41.391
I would never let him put
his nose where it shouldn't be.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.685
Patty...

10:43.727 --> 10:45.478
When we lose ones
that we love,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.440
we tend to look for things
that aren't there,

10:48.481 --> 10:53.319
and sometimes dogs do
accidentally eat things

10:53.361 --> 10:55.363
that just aren't meant
for them.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.489

10:56.531 --> 10:58.450
Not Hank.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.493

11:00.535 --> 11:02.787
We took care
of each other.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.583
I would never let him
down like that.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.710
I understand.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.504

right away.

Thank you.
Yeah.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.345
So here is the security footage
your friend sent over.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.013
The fireworks
started at 8:00 PM,

11:20.055 --> 11:22.015

from around that time.

kicking in already.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.474
That's strange.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.643
It says here he doesn't have
any credit history

12:06.685 --> 12:07.894

is this guy?
I don't know.

is like,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.567
well,
a walk in the park.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.612
Well, I'm afraid this case
is a bit of a downer, actually.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.949
We're investigating the death
of a client's dog, Hank.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.659
That's awful.
What happened?

13:04.701 --> 13:07.328
He was poisoned,
and the owner, Patty,

13:07.370 --> 13:08.913
is insisting
that there's foul play.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.207
I guess this is a good place
to start.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.085
Dog parks breed
some serious drama.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.754
I mean, it's more likely that
Hank ate something

13:15.795 --> 13:17.589
that he wasn't supposed to
when he was out and about,

13:17.630 --> 13:19.382
but regardless,
it's a good place to begin

13:19.424 --> 13:20.842
whilst we wait
for the post-mortem

13:20.884 --> 13:22.135
that the client ordered
from the vet.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.263
She asked for
a dog-topsy?

13:25.305 --> 13:28.433
It's actually -- it's called
a necropsy, but yes.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.227
If we can figure out
what Hank ingested,

13:31.269 --> 13:32.479
then it'll help us
determine

13:32.520 --> 13:33.897
whether his death
was an accident.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.440
We find out
it wasn't?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.776
Maybe one of the dog owners
here will be able to tell us

13:37.817 --> 13:39.277
who had it in
for Hank.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.112
Oh.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.073
Okay, thanks.

a pretty good print

Were you able to find the
location of the ATM David used?

13:54.459 --> 13:56.127
Yeah.
After leaving the hotel,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.213
David headed to a strip club
called Seize the Lei

13:58.254 --> 13:59.631
and used an ATM inside.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.300
Luckily, I know the bouncer,
so I'll give him a call.

He was meeting one of the club's

he was scoring drugs.

they sneak off for a few hours.

It's weird for David
to have disappeared like this.

Alright, let's just assume
he did go to buy drugs.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.673
Does your contact know
where he went afterwards?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.341
Well, he said he left
the club in a taxi,

14:43.383 --> 14:45.343
so if we can
track down that cab,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.512

you might be right.

I don't know, but there was
that cute server

20:47.330 --> 20:51.334

Koko Head Cafe awhile back.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.752

20:52.794 --> 20:54.796

yoga paddleboard instructor

You think he'd be into
paddleboard yoga?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.802
I mean, why not? It's basically
yoga on a paddleboard.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.221
Who wouldn't be into it,
am I right?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.806
Kind of depends on
who the instructor is,

21:04.848 --> 21:06.266
you know what I mean?
Give it a try.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.309

How on Earth could Hank
have gotten into rat poison?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.375
Strychnine
is an odorless white powder

21:32.417 --> 21:34.669
that could quite easily
be mistaken for sugar.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.755
An examination of the contents
of Hank's stomach

21:36.796 --> 21:41.259
revealed that the last thing
he ate was a lemon bar

21:41.301 --> 21:44.179
that was full of it.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.555
Oh, no!

21:45.597 --> 21:46.890
I had just made a batch,

21:46.931 --> 21:48.975
but I wouldn't make
that kind of mistake.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.518
Could it be
anything else?

21:50.560 --> 21:54.356
Well, have you eaten any of
those lemon bars since?

21:54.397 --> 21:55.690
No.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.692
Hank passed shortly after
I baked them.

21:57.734 --> 22:01.696
I haven't had much
of an appetite since then.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.531
I put them
on the table to cool.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.575
He must have snuck one.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.037
Patty, I know this
is very difficult,

22:09.079 --> 22:11.664
but there is actually a more
pressing issue at the moment.

22:11.706 --> 22:14.376
If you didn't mistake
the rat poison for sugar,

22:14.417 --> 22:18.421
then it's possible that
someone is trying to kill you.

22:18.463 --> 22:21.299
Do you have any idea
how this could have happened?

22:23.510 --> 22:25.887
I bought a box of sugar
two days ago

22:25.929 --> 22:27.889
and had it delivered
with my groceries,

22:27.931 --> 22:30.100
but I wasn't home
and the bags were left

22:30.141 --> 22:32.143
on my doorstep
for a couple of hours.

22:32.185 --> 22:35.772
So anyone passing by could have
put the rat poison in the sugar

22:35.814 --> 22:39.150
and re-sealed the box.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.278
Patty, can you think of anyone
who might want to harm you?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.197
No, everybody loves me.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.035
Patty, I really need you
to think about this.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.537
Your life may depend on it.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.164
If somebody tried to kill you,
they may try again.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.879
There's Owen.
Who's Owen?

22:59.921 --> 23:01.381
Oh, we were
seeing each other.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.882
Engaged, actually.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.760
I ended things
a couple of months ago.

23:05.802 --> 23:06.928
I'm pretty sure
he would know

23:06.970 --> 23:09.139
when my groceries
were delivered.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.562
I found Patty's ex-fiancé
on social media.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.189
Huh.
Take a look.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.774
Owen Summers.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.359
You think he was trying
to get back at Patty

23:21.401 --> 23:23.361
after she ended things?

23:23.403 --> 23:24.821
I mean, it might be
about more than that.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.239
Look at these photos.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.783
It looks to me like Owen
isn't a man of great means.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.952
Unlike Patty, who seems
pretty well-off.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.620
Right, so this man
who just lost a shot

23:32.662 --> 23:36.791
at Patty's enormous fortune also
knows her delivery schedule.

and a motive, if you ask me.

this case is not adding up.

How could it?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.063
David spends years living
under a stolen identity,

23:58.104 --> 24:01.066
suddenly walks out on his family
and then buys a guy?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.400
Then he decides to hide out

24:02.442 --> 24:04.194
and shoot at anyone
who comes looking for him.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.571
Yeah, it sounds like he could be
on the run, but from who?

24:06.613 --> 24:09.949
And why now, while he's on
vacation with his family?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.621
Just got a match
to David's print.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.955
Real name's Cliff Bennett.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.665
Worked as an accountant
for the Detroit mob

24:17.707 --> 24:20.585
until he vanished
in 2010.

24:20.627 --> 24:25.090
2010, that's when David Carter's
credit history begins.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.383
I'm thinking he parted ways
with the mob

24:26.424 --> 24:28.093
on less than friendly
terms.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.678
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.304
Sections of the report
are redacted,

24:31.346 --> 24:34.015
but the FBI suspects
Bennett stole $2 million

24:34.057 --> 24:35.892
from his employer.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.935
Wait, hang on.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.269
What is it?

24:38.311 --> 24:40.480
Got a photo array
of Bennett's old associates,

24:40.522 --> 24:43.274
and one of them,
Vincent Welles --

24:43.316 --> 24:47.362
he looks familiar,
and I think I know from where.

24:47.404 --> 24:48.863
Oh, you're not gonna
believe this.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.949
The security footage
of David leaving the hotel

24:50.990 --> 24:52.951
shows a guy following him.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.247
That's the same guy.

24:57.288 --> 25:00.458
So David probably ran into
Welles at the bar,

25:00.500 --> 25:03.128
where they recognized each other
from back in the day,

25:03.169 --> 25:05.755
and knowing Welles still
had it out for him,

25:05.797 --> 25:07.215
he must have taken off.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.925
David didn't want Welles knowing
he had a family

25:08.967 --> 25:11.136
that the mob could use
as leverage against him.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.721
He didn't
abandon his family.

25:12.762 --> 25:13.972
He was trying
to protect them.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.473
Alright,
so after leaving the hotel,

25:15.515 --> 25:17.684
he must have given Welles
the slip, then bought the gun.

25:17.726 --> 25:21.354
Yeah, but after being on the run
for all these years,

25:21.396 --> 25:23.982
isn't it kind of strange
that they end up on vacation

25:24.024 --> 25:25.859
at the same time,
at the same resort?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.277
Well, if it's gonna happen
anywhere,

25:27.318 --> 25:29.029
makes sense
it's in Hawaii.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.822

pass through here every year.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.657

who David was at the hotel with.

Let's move.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.071
I got her.
Send the address and the code.

30:21.112 --> 30:26.618
**

30:26.659 --> 30:28.495
"Send me the address
and the code."

30:28.536 --> 30:30.622
That's what you remember
them saying?

30:32.457 --> 30:34.084
Can you help
my Mom and Dad?

30:34.125 --> 30:36.836
Oh, absolutely.
I'm gonna help find them.

30:36.878 --> 30:39.589
I promise.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.883
Sounds like Welles is gonna
use Dana as bait.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.094
Yeah, he probably had her
call David's burner phone

30:44.135 --> 30:45.261
to make demands.

30:45.303 --> 30:46.554
The question is,
where'd he take her?

30:46.596 --> 30:50.308
Lots of places
require access codes.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.727
Yeah, Hawaii isn't
Welles' home turf, right?

30:52.769 --> 30:54.688
So his options
are gonna be limited.

30:54.729 --> 30:58.274
He needs something that's
secretive but easily accessible.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.401
Somewhere like
a vacation rental.

30:59.442 --> 31:00.610
They're all over the island,

31:00.652 --> 31:01.778
can be booked
at a moment's notice.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.571
And most use
electronic keypads

31:03.613 --> 31:05.448
that can be unlocked
with a code.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.574
You know, Rick's got a friend
that works

31:06.616 --> 31:07.867
at permit enforcement.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.285
She should be able to give us
a full list

31:09.327 --> 31:10.995
of all recent bookings.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.625
Patrick: You think
I tried to kill Patty?

31:15.667 --> 31:19.212
That's got to be the most
ridiculous idea I've ever heard.

31:19.254 --> 31:20.630
Is it?

31:20.672 --> 31:22.966
I'm sure the news of Patty's
engagement delighted you,

31:23.008 --> 31:24.718
'cause if Owen and Patty
tied the knot,

31:24.759 --> 31:26.803
then those outrageous
alimony payments

31:26.845 --> 31:28.346
would have been
a thing of the past.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.807
And then she broke it off
but you were still on the hook,

31:30.849 --> 31:32.976
so you decided to do away
with the alimony

31:33.018 --> 31:34.769
by getting rid of Patty.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.105
Patty, I get
you're upset about Hank,

31:37.147 --> 31:39.983
but how can you accuse me
of this nonsense?

31:40.025 --> 31:41.901
It really isn't that
far-fetched, Patrick.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.820
Tell me,
do you happen to know

31:43.862 --> 31:47.991
when Patty's groceries
are being delivered?

31:48.033 --> 31:49.492
He sure does.

31:49.534 --> 31:50.869
Well then, it wouldn't be
all that hard for you

31:50.910 --> 31:52.829
to poison
her unattended groceries.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.873
And I'm willing to be that
a search of your house

31:54.914 --> 31:57.625
would find
a large stash of strychnine,

31:57.667 --> 32:00.754
the same rat poison that
was found in Patty's lemon bars.

32:03.048 --> 32:06.343
Even if that were true,
you can't prove any of it.

32:06.384 --> 32:07.677
Oh, sweetie.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.512
All we have to do
is hand over the evidence.

32:09.554 --> 32:11.389
It's their job
to prove it.

32:11.431 --> 32:14.142
What --
What's going on?

32:14.184 --> 32:17.187
What do you think?

32:17.228 --> 32:18.521
Oh, one more thing.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.231
Your cellphone connected
automatically

32:20.273 --> 32:21.608
to the Wi-Fi router
in this house

32:21.649 --> 32:23.693
on the morning
of the poisoning.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.070
HPD Uni #1: Patrick Carson,

32:25.111 --> 32:28.031
you're under arrest
for attempted murder.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.074
Let's go.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.950
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.828
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

32:33.870 --> 32:36.206
You two
have been so wonderful!

32:36.247 --> 32:38.541
I just can't
thank you enough.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.044
Oh, we were
just happy to help.

32:41.086 --> 32:42.337
We're glad you're safe.

32:42.379 --> 32:44.005
I just can't help but wonder
if things had been

32:44.047 --> 32:47.384
a little different --
if I had just married Owen,

32:47.425 --> 32:50.136
or I'd been home when
the groceries were delivered,

32:50.178 --> 32:51.554
Hank would still be here.

32:51.596 --> 32:53.556
Well, how would you
have known?

32:53.598 --> 32:55.725
The way I see it,
if it weren't for you,

32:55.767 --> 32:58.520
Hank would never have
gotten his justice.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.063
You're right.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.857
It's just gonna take some time
for this to stop hurting.

33:02.899 --> 33:05.902
Oh.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.862
Oh, Patty.

33:07.904 --> 33:08.822
I'm so sorry.

33:08.863 --> 33:10.573
If it's any consolation,

33:10.615 --> 33:14.577
I think that the heartbreak
you feel after a loss

33:14.619 --> 33:16.037
tells you that you've
experienced

33:16.079 --> 33:17.163
something really special.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.915
And in this case,

33:18.957 --> 33:21.751
it was the love
of a loyal pet.

33:21.793 --> 33:26.006
And I'm sure that no matter
where Hank is,

33:26.047 --> 33:29.134
he's at peace knowing
that his final act in this world

33:29.175 --> 33:33.263
was protecting the human
he loved the most.

33:33.304 --> 33:35.974
Thank you.
I love you.

33:36.016 --> 33:42.439
**

33:42.480 --> 33:48.653
**

33:48.695 --> 33:50.113
Katsumoto: This has to be it,
right?

33:50.155 --> 33:52.615
Magnum: Yeah, the IP address
used to make the reservation

33:52.657 --> 33:55.035
was traced back
to the Royal Honua Hotel.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.203
There's only one car.
Welles has gotta be alone,

33:57.245 --> 33:58.955
so as long as we
take him by surprise,

33:58.997 --> 34:02.125
we should be able
to get Dana out safely.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.960
Hang on.

34:04.002 --> 34:09.591
**

34:09.632 --> 34:15.388
**

34:15.430 --> 34:16.806
Been a long time,
Bennett.

34:16.848 --> 34:18.058
Welles must have
called in some back-up

34:18.099 --> 34:19.517
after he spotted David.

34:19.559 --> 34:20.852
So much for
outnumbering them.

34:20.894 --> 34:23.438
Yeah. We're gonna need
a change of plans.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.066
**

34:30.653 --> 34:38.578
**

34:38.620 --> 34:40.080
David, oh, my God.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.707
I'm so sorry, Dana.
I'm so sorry.

34:42.749 --> 34:44.626
I never should have
put you through this.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.087
It's gonna --
It's gonna be over soon, okay?

34:50.924 --> 34:52.842
Built a nice little life
for yourself

34:52.884 --> 34:55.220
with my money,
didn't you?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.931
It's between us, Welles.

34:57.972 --> 35:01.059
She didn't have anything
to do with this.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.727
Just let her go.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.604
So she can go straight
to the cops?

35:04.646 --> 35:07.148
Because I can get you
your money back.

35:07.190 --> 35:13.697
**

35:13.738 --> 35:16.157
Look, for 13 years, I have lived
with this debt hanging over me,

35:16.199 --> 35:19.619
knowing that this day
was gonna come.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.371
Been living on
borrowed time.

35:23.873 --> 35:25.375
I don't regret
a second of it.

35:29.045 --> 35:32.757
I just wish
we had longer.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.051
What?
What are you doing?

35:35.093 --> 35:37.512
David, no.

35:37.554 --> 35:39.514
We both know I'm not
walking out of here,

35:39.556 --> 35:42.600
but I have an offshore account
with your $2 million in it.

35:42.642 --> 35:46.479
You let her go
and it is all yours.

35:46.521 --> 35:54.195
**

35:54.237 --> 35:55.947
Get him a laptop.

35:59.492 --> 36:02.495
The transfer's only gonna
take a few minutes.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.372
Yeah,
but if we breach now,

36:04.414 --> 36:06.291
someone could get killed
in the crossfire.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.376
Yeah, and those sliding glass
doors are sure to give us away.

36:11.504 --> 36:13.131
I think
I've got an idea.

36:13.173 --> 36:18.261
**

36:18.303 --> 36:23.391
**

36:23.433 --> 36:24.976
What's the hold up?

36:25.018 --> 36:27.562
How do I know you won't shoot us
once I make this transfer?

36:27.604 --> 36:29.105
You don't,

36:29.147 --> 36:32.025
but I will shoot both of you
if I don't get my money.

36:33.693 --> 36:38.406
[ Knock on door ]

36:38.448 --> 36:40.158
Who the hell is that?

36:42.744 --> 36:44.412
Get the door.

36:44.454 --> 36:53.755
**

36:53.797 --> 36:55.674
HPD!
Drop your weapons!

36:55.715 --> 37:02.263
**

37:02.305 --> 37:03.682
You're not a cop.

37:03.723 --> 37:06.685
I saw you going around with that
hotel dick this morning.

37:06.726 --> 37:10.105
That badge ain't real.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.523
Fine,
I'm not a cop anymore,

37:11.564 --> 37:15.443
but I'm still taking you in.
Citizen's arrest.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.320
Nice try,

37:17.362 --> 37:20.865
but I think
you're a little outmanned.

37:20.907 --> 37:23.493
Yeah, I can see that.

37:23.535 --> 37:25.954
Actually, coming in here, I knew
it was gonna be two against one,

37:25.995 --> 37:27.956
but I did it
because it was the only way.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.165
Only way for what?

37:29.207 --> 37:30.375
Only way to buy my friend
some time

37:30.417 --> 37:32.377
to pick the lock
on the back door.

37:34.462 --> 37:35.880
Give it up, Welles.

37:35.922 --> 37:37.549
Vacation's over.

Mia: Mommy, Daddy!

37:59.362 --> 38:04.993
**

38:05.035 --> 38:07.245
How'd you feel
flashing that fake badge?

38:07.287 --> 38:09.956
Better than confiscating it,
right?

38:09.998 --> 38:13.168
Don't get used to it.

38:13.209 --> 38:15.754
David gonna be able
to cut a plea?

38:15.795 --> 38:17.714
Well, if he testifies
against Welles,

38:17.756 --> 38:19.758
he should be able to walk away
from any charges.

38:19.799 --> 38:21.176
Is he pushing for
witness protection?

38:21.217 --> 38:22.594
I don't know.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.095
Welles and his guys
are going away for a long time,

38:24.137 --> 38:26.598
and David's already
had to start over once.

38:26.639 --> 38:30.268
There is one thing
that I still don't get.

38:30.310 --> 38:31.519
What's that?

38:31.561 --> 38:33.646
How come you asked me to
work this case with you?

38:33.688 --> 38:36.358
Because I like your company.
C'mon.

38:36.399 --> 38:38.234
You thought I needed
a distraction today

38:38.276 --> 38:41.071
to keep me from stressing
about the hearing.

38:41.112 --> 38:42.405
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:42.447 --> 38:43.490
Mm-hmm.

38:43.531 --> 38:45.158
Thanks, Magnum.

38:45.200 --> 38:54.292
**

38:54.334 --> 38:56.628
Patrick had only been
in custody for 30 minutes

38:56.670 --> 38:58.380
before he confessed
to the entire thing.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.464
That is amazing.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.257
We're batting a thousand
at this point.

39:01.299 --> 39:02.717
I'm still trying
to figure out

39:02.759 --> 39:05.261
why the lads aren't trying
to bite your head off.

39:06.846 --> 39:10.058
Because they finally, you know,
have come to their senses

39:10.100 --> 39:12.727
and realized I'm not
that bad of a guy, right?

39:12.769 --> 39:13.978
Right, boys?

39:14.020 --> 39:17.023
After four years?
Oh, no way.

39:17.065 --> 39:19.192
Yeah, something
must have happened.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.361
These dogs are hard-wired
to hate you.

39:21.403 --> 39:24.072
You know, I reckon the lads
are probably just too exhausted

39:24.114 --> 39:26.950
from the dog park
to bother with Magnum.

39:26.991 --> 39:28.284
Right?

39:28.326 --> 39:30.537
Totally, yeah.
You know what we should do?

39:30.578 --> 39:32.163
We should go to the guest house
and grab a drink.

39:32.205 --> 39:34.833
Rick and TC are over there now
if you want to --

39:34.874 --> 39:36.292
Ooh, sounds good.
Kumu?

39:36.334 --> 39:38.253
Oh, well, I've been craving

39:38.294 --> 39:40.422
one of Rick's
lilikoi margaritas.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.007
Think he'll
whip some up for us?

39:42.048 --> 39:43.758
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I mean, he's been on the couch

39:43.800 --> 39:45.093
for, you know,
the last couple days.

39:45.135 --> 39:46.344
The least he can do
is make us a drink.

39:46.386 --> 39:48.763
Okay.
Alright, come on, lads.

39:48.805 --> 39:50.515
Alright, let's go.
Come on, boys.

39:50.557 --> 39:51.850
Come on.
Come on.

39:51.891 --> 39:54.060
This way.

39:54.978 --> 39:58.064
I still can't believe Gordon
let you use those fake badges.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.483
That's the thing,
it was actually his idea.

40:00.525 --> 40:01.901
Hi.

40:01.943 --> 40:03.987
Uh-oh, that's not a good look.
What's going on here?

40:04.029 --> 40:05.989
Are you alright,
Rick?

40:06.031 --> 40:08.783
No.
No, I'm not alright.

40:08.825 --> 40:10.243
Did you break
the washing machine again?

40:10.285 --> 40:11.327
No.

40:11.369 --> 40:13.496
Did you clog the loo
for the fourth time?

40:13.538 --> 40:15.373
No, and I did some research
on that,

40:15.415 --> 40:17.000
and it's
the low-flow toilets

40:17.042 --> 40:20.045
that Robin has on this estate,
not me, okay?

40:20.086 --> 40:24.132
Okay, well,
what is it?

40:24.174 --> 40:25.842
It was an accident.

40:25.884 --> 40:29.721
I made Roberto some pancakes
and when I went to serve him,

40:29.763 --> 40:32.223
I left the cage door open.

40:32.265 --> 40:34.392
You lost Thomas's mouse?

40:34.434 --> 40:37.645
Unfortunately.

40:37.687 --> 40:40.482
We -- We spent all day
looking for the little guy.

40:40.523 --> 40:41.858
Mm.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.234
Look, Thomas, I'm gonna
make this up to you, okay?

40:43.276 --> 40:45.320
I promise.
I will replace Roberto.

40:45.362 --> 40:47.655
Not that Roberto II
can be replaced --

40:47.697 --> 40:49.199
Why are you smirking?
He's smirking.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.950
He's laughing.
Why are you laughing?

40:50.992 --> 40:52.952
Are you laughing?

40:52.994 --> 40:54.954
You want to glance
at the cage?

40:58.583 --> 40:59.918
Roberto!

40:59.959 --> 41:03.630
Oh, now you want
to come out?

41:03.672 --> 41:07.842
Higgins: Are those tiny
mouse pancakes?

41:07.884 --> 41:09.135
Yeah.

41:09.177 --> 41:11.346
How long you been giving him
a short stack?

41:11.388 --> 41:12.681
Awhile.

41:12.722 --> 41:15.350
That's gotta be the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

41:15.392 --> 41:17.435
Yeah.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.854
Oh, my God.

41:19.896 --> 41:22.315
I've been looking
for this for ages.

41:22.357 --> 41:29.447
**

41:29.489 --> 41:30.907
Dude.

41:30.949 --> 41:31.991
Magnum and Higgins?

41:32.033 --> 41:33.159
Together?

41:33.201 --> 41:34.786
I think so.

41:34.828 --> 41:38.039
Game changer.

41:39.749 --> 41:48.550
**

41:48.591 --> 41:57.392
**

41:57.434 --> 42:05.984
**

42:06.026 --> 42:15.076
**
