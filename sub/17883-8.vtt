WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.334
Oh, Cash.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.536
You saved me from Skeletor.
How romantic.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.106
Anything
for my soul mate Molly.

00:07.108 --> 00:11.777
Now let me lay you down on this
Tauntaun-skin rug and make some sweet...

00:11.779 --> 00:12.478
Stop, stop, stop!

00:12.480 --> 00:14.713
I feel like I'm about to see
something I can't un-see.

00:14.715 --> 00:18.250
Dude. This is called
a destiny diorama.

00:18.252 --> 00:21.387
I'm visualizing my future with Molly
so it'll come true.

00:21.389 --> 00:25.224
Yeah, we're gonna live
in Castle Grayskull.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.961
Okay, well, I don't get
what you see in her,

00:28.963 --> 00:30.496
but power to ya.
Go for it.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.032
Oh, I will. I'm gonna
ask her out. Yeah.

00:33.034 --> 00:37.269
I'm just building up my nerve.
I'll do it in one...

00:37.271 --> 00:39.471
Maybe two years.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.540
I got plenty of time.

00:41.941 --> 00:44.777
I'm being deported
in three weeks.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.246
No! Oh, my God!
This is terrible!

00:47.248 --> 00:48.814
How can this be
happening to me?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.149
Well, it's mostly
happening to me.

00:50.151 --> 00:54.787
My work visa expired because you never
filled out the extension.

00:54.789 --> 00:55.687
Yeah, I did.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.923
Really? Well, pardon my French,
but bollocks!

00:57.925 --> 01:01.393
It's here, covered with coffee stains
and penis doodles.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.863
All right, all right. Everybody shutty.
We can fight this.

01:04.865 --> 01:05.964
I know a guy
who knows a guy

01:05.966 --> 01:07.900
who can bribe a guy
at Immigration.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.035
Hello.
Agent Benson, please.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.571
I see. I see.
Good day.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.673
He's dead.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.407
Well, as H.R.,

01:15.409 --> 01:17.876
I could petition the court
for a stay of deportation,

01:17.878 --> 01:19.044
but that could
take months,

01:19.046 --> 01:21.246
so your best option
is to make me your bride.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.748
It's legal.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.783
Wait a minute. Yes.
Okay.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.517
Oh, my gosh.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.386
You're gonna get married just like
in that movie <i>Green Card</i>

01:27.388 --> 01:31.390
where that fat French guy convinces
Andie MacDowell that he's not an uggo.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.660
Stop. No, stop.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.062
When I used to fantasize
about my wedding day,

01:37.064 --> 01:40.365
a sham marriage is not
what I had pictured.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.668
Of course I'll marry you,
Prince William.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.003
I just have to
let Hugh Grant down gently

01:45.005 --> 01:45.871
and quit the Spice Girls.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.206
Oh, brilliant, Molly.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.542
Now let's do some kissy-kissy
with our shirts off.

01:51.145 --> 01:55.280
A wedding is a sacred bond
between two people,

01:55.282 --> 01:55.948
not to be trifled with.

01:55.950 --> 01:59.985
Come on.
I've trifled with that bitch four times.

01:59.987 --> 02:00.686
You just say, "I do,"

02:00.688 --> 02:01.920
and then when
the bouncy-bouncy dies down,

02:01.922 --> 02:05.057
you pull the rip cord and smoke a jay.
No big whoop.

02:05.059 --> 02:06.125
Wonderful.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.159
Oz, what's going on
with Molly?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.260
Cash is freaking out
over here.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.929
Look, nobody wants the girl to stick around
more than me.

02:10.931 --> 02:14.099
When it comes to Veronica,
Molly is my buffer.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.334
She's my Buffy.

02:15.336 --> 02:15.968
She's my rock.

02:15.970 --> 02:19.037
She's the only one here
that uses correct postage.

02:19.039 --> 02:19.638
She will be missed.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.573
Who am I gonna watch
<i>Downton Abbey</i> with?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.209
It's  <i>"Downtown."</i>
<i>"Downtown Abbey."</i>

02:24.211 --> 02:25.477
Yeah, it's  <i>"Downtown."</i>
<i> Ricky.</i>

02:25.479 --> 02:27.179
I'm pretty sure
it's  <i>"Downtown."</i>

02:27.181 --> 02:28.380
Are we talking
about the same Molly?

02:28.382 --> 02:31.984
The one who leaves passive-aggressive
post-it notes

02:31.986 --> 02:32.551
all over my desk?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.153
"Cameron, thank you so much

02:34.155 --> 02:36.088
"for cleaning
the office microwave."

02:36.090 --> 02:36.889
Sounds okay to me.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.725
No. I didn't clean it.
She's being a dick.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.894
Screw
my 1-slash-2-year plan.

02:41.896 --> 02:46.532
It's time I become her superhero
and keep her in the country.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.233
The hell is that?

02:48.235 --> 02:51.537
It's my master replica green lantern
engagement ring.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.138
Easy, cupcake.
When it comes to Molly,

02:53.140 --> 02:54.173
she needs somebody
who's all business,

02:54.175 --> 02:55.607
not somebody who wants
to get up in her business.

02:55.609 --> 02:59.945
Yeah, Oz is right.
You're way too emotionally involved.

02:59.947 --> 03:00.913
Lucky for us, I am not.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.615
Now the fate of this office depends on
Molly sticking around.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.919
That's why I'm gonna jump on this grenade
and marry the girl myself.

03:06.921 --> 03:07.920
I couldn't help
but overhear, you know,

03:07.922 --> 03:10.589
because I was hiding behind the
<i>Tron</i> machine, spying.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.126
You can't marry Molly.
You already have a wife.

03:14.128 --> 03:18.530
I think I'd know
if I was married.

03:22.068 --> 03:22.601
Son of a bitch.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.537
So we got married
in March 2005,

03:25.539 --> 03:29.241
and then, oh, look, married again
in June 2010...

03:29.243 --> 03:32.978
Uh-huh. And then divorced
in July...

03:32.980 --> 03:33.946
Yeah.

03:33.948 --> 03:34.513
And then, yes,

03:34.515 --> 03:37.482
we ran into each other
last year in Cozumel...

03:37.484 --> 03:40.018
Got crazy drunk on tequila,
and tied the knot again.

03:40.020 --> 03:45.057
Oh. I guess we both ate the worm
on that one, huh?

03:45.659 --> 03:49.194
So we're married.
What now?

03:53.099 --> 03:55.067
Amy Kyleen Osbourne,

03:55.069 --> 03:57.903
would you make me the happiest man
on planet Earth,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.671
and grant me a divorce?

03:59.673 --> 04:00.405
Oh, Oz.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.575
It's such a big decision.
What's a girl to do? No.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.178
"No"?
What do you mean, "No"?

04:06.180 --> 04:07.479
You loathe me.
I loathe you.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.048
That is the one thing
we agree on.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.550
Because what's the point?

04:11.552 --> 04:14.486
We get together,
and then we break up,

04:14.488 --> 04:17.055
and then we have
insane monkey sex...

04:17.057 --> 04:17.656
Mmm-hmm.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.957
And then we get
back together,

04:18.959 --> 04:22.327
so why not save the legal fees
and just stay married?

04:22.329 --> 04:23.729
'Cause this time,
I mean it.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.631
Okay. Well, I need
to tell you that...

04:25.633 --> 04:27.699
...got something pierced.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.767
Oh, really?
Mmm.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.102
Oh, no, no!
No, no, no.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.171
I don't care
what you got pierced.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.208
Sign the papers.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.277
Legal fees it is.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.746
Unless...

04:40.748 --> 04:42.214
Ooh!

04:42.749 --> 04:44.650
Still a "no."

04:44.652 --> 04:46.585
Nice piercing.

04:46.686 --> 04:47.452
Hey, Molly.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.954
I'd like you
to meet Thor,

04:48.956 --> 04:51.189
my personal trainer
and your future husband.

04:51.191 --> 04:55.193
Come on, Thor.
Give her a peek under the hood.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.696
Am I right? Huh?

04:59.466 --> 05:02.968
No offense, Mr. Thor,
but I think I'll pass.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.436
Oh, great.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.306
Well, you really screwed this one up.
All right.

05:07.308 --> 05:11.443
My place, usual time.
Wear the thing.

05:11.511 --> 05:12.844
Look, Veronica,

05:12.846 --> 05:15.013
if I go through
with this marriage,

05:15.015 --> 05:17.983
it has to be
100% platonic.

05:17.985 --> 05:23.088
No money, no sex, no love.
Just like my parents.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.489
All right.
Let me get this straight.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.360
So you want a plain,
bland, vanilla, boring

05:28.362 --> 05:31.363
Joe Shmoe who, sounds like,
doesn't even like you.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.565
Really? A post-it note
on my windshield?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.567
Yes. Got your attention,
didn't it?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.569
Perhaps now you'll hand in
your expense reports

05:37.571 --> 05:38.937
before I'm kicked
out the country.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.038
Maybe I will,
maybe I won't.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.173
Well, it would be
very useful if you...

05:41.175 --> 05:42.941
I don't know. Would, please,
because...

05:42.943 --> 05:44.743
Well, maybe I could...
"Please" what?

05:44.745 --> 05:45.811
Please hand them in.
"Them"? "Them" now?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.579
It would be nice and professional of you...
When are you talking about?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.014
If you could just hand them in
like everybody else

05:49.016 --> 05:51.316
in the office has, on time...
Well, it would be very professional

05:51.318 --> 05:52.684
if you sent me an e-mail
and stopped...

05:52.686 --> 05:55.187
Three days ago, I sent you two e-mails.
Ooh. Ooh.

05:55.189 --> 05:55.721
What?

05:55.723 --> 05:59.024
Oz, thank God.
Uh, Veronica's forcing me to marry Molly.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.826
And please don't say...
I'll allow it.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.760
No, just because
you allow it

06:01.762 --> 06:03.628
doesn't mean it has to be allowed.
Yes, it does.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.264
We're gonna have a dummy wedding,
and you are the dummy.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.165
You're gonna
sign some papers,

06:07.167 --> 06:08.166
answer a few questions,
and bam!

06:08.168 --> 06:11.136
In two years' time, you get a
quickie divorce. You're a free man.

06:11.138 --> 06:11.636
Two years?

06:11.638 --> 06:15.140
I'll wait for her.
It fits into my 1-slash-2-year plan.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.243
No, you don't have to wait.
You can have her.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.077
No. No, you can't.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.812
Oz, I'll never pass
the immigration interview.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.215
You know
I'm the worst liar ever.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.084
Who are you?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.386
I work here.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.254
I'm Dick Biggens.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.256
Porn star Dick Biggens?

06:32.859 --> 06:34.493
I have to admit...

06:34.495 --> 06:37.763
I have very little faith in you,
but we're out of options.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.931
Help us, Cameron.
You're our only hope.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.235
No. No way.
There's no way in hell.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.037
He said, "Yes"!

07:02.688 --> 07:05.323
<i>♪ We got your back</i>

07:09.762 --> 07:11.830
So, haven't heard
from your attorneys.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.498
Have you signed
the papers, or what?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.300
Depends on if you agree
to the pre-div.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.968
What?
It's like a reverse pre-nup.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.571
It's just
a little list of demands

07:19.573 --> 07:22.274
before I grant you
your freedom.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.278
"Boat, house, houseboat, diamond..."
Are you insane?

07:26.280 --> 07:29.147
You want me to buy you
a disengagement ring?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.215
I'll allow it.

07:30.217 --> 07:30.816
That's my thing.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.186
See number 15.
I get your catchphrases.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.253
I see what you're
trying to do here.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.422
You're trying to rattle me,
but it's not gonna work,

07:37.424 --> 07:38.824
because it's just stuff.
Take it all.

07:38.826 --> 07:43.094
Well, that's good,
because that brings me to our last item.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.398
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no! Hey!

07:46.400 --> 07:49.401
I would rather be married to you
for another hundred years

07:49.403 --> 07:50.535
than give up
my Kirk Chair.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.704
What's the matter?
It's just stuff, right?

07:52.706 --> 07:56.241
Shatner gave me the chair.
It's the Captain's chair.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.142
It represents my yearning

07:57.144 --> 08:00.545
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

08:00.547 --> 08:03.014
Well, now it's gonna
be a dog bed.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.116
No deal, devil woman.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.888
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
another sham marriage to attend to.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.958
<i>L'chaim!</i>

08:16.295 --> 08:17.696
Always a bridesmaid.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.563
You're not a bridesmaid.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.731
Then why am I wearing
a lime green dress?

08:19.733 --> 08:23.735
'Cause you're a crazy woman.
Now where's that cake?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.404
I was told
there'd be cake.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.740
You know, your wife was looking
real fine at the wedding today.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.610
All fine in those
boots and stuff.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.112
Man, that part of the leg
that goes from the top of the boot

08:34.114 --> 08:37.582
to the bottom of the skirt?
That right there?

08:37.584 --> 08:38.783
F.D.A. approved.

08:38.785 --> 08:39.384
What are you doing?

08:39.386 --> 08:41.620
You pissed? Huh? You want
to punch me in the face?

08:41.622 --> 08:44.322
Little protective of your wife?
Hmm? Huh? Dude, dude,

08:44.324 --> 08:45.657
I don't like Molly,
okay?

08:45.659 --> 08:46.992
I give you my blessing.
Ask her out.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.694
Seriously,
date my wife, please.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.595
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.732
This is a beautiful
moment, man.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.272
Hey.
Hello. Are you Mr. Price?

09:00.274 --> 09:01.873
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that's me.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.742
Richard Holden,
Immigration.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.144
Need to speak to you
and your wife, please.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.679
My wife?

09:08.314 --> 09:10.515
Yes! Yes! My wife!

09:10.517 --> 09:12.617
Just, it's so new,
and I mean,

09:12.619 --> 09:17.289
- I can't even believe I'm married.
-  Mistake!

09:17.590 --> 09:19.357
Wedding humor.
You probably don't get it.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.893
I see you're not
wearing a ring.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.629
Neither are you.
Shall we?

09:24.631 --> 09:29.000
I... We weren't
expecting you.

09:29.002 --> 09:33.371
Uh, yes, I like to, uh,
have surprise visits.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.040
It helps
keep people honest.

09:35.042 --> 09:39.244
So, um, you live here,

09:39.246 --> 09:41.413
in this place, with your...

09:41.415 --> 09:43.181
...with your wife?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.684
Just the three of us.
"Three"?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.185
Yeah, I'm...
I'm the roommate.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.321
About to move out
tomorrow.

09:49.323 --> 09:52.691
He's gay.
He's a homosexual man

09:52.693 --> 09:55.260
who enjoys hugging
other men sexually.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.395
That's...
That's what he does.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.163
Yep.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.264
Mr. Price, you do know

09:59.266 --> 10:02.200
that lying about your marital status
is a felony?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.668
Yes, I do know that.
I'm a lawyer.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.972
Uh, I have a car...
You know what? I don't have a card.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.073
It's more of a word-of-mouth
kind of thing,

10:08.075 --> 10:11.142
but, um, we should maybe reschedule
this tomorrow, when my wife is here.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.477
I think that would
work much better,

10:12.479 --> 10:14.879
so I'll see you then.
Bye-bye now. If we could just...

10:14.881 --> 10:18.016
Damn it!
That was a disaster!

10:18.018 --> 10:19.217
Okay, chicos
and chic-ettes.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.620
The suit from Immigration's going
to be here tonight, so let's keep it up.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.990
Let's give this man cave
a much-needed estrogen bath.

10:24.992 --> 10:28.159
I've got some mad
bras and panties.

10:28.161 --> 10:28.760
Oh. Oh.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.829
Are you sure it's necessary for me
to move in here?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.798
Well, look, it's only temporary,
one, maybe three years.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.836
Three years? I'm sorry.
This is spiraling out of control.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.837
Maybe I should just
go back to London,

10:38.839 --> 10:41.172
and I can just clear
all of this up there.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.741
Aw, don't...
Ooh.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.509
Oh, jeez.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.944
What the hell?

10:45.946 --> 10:46.911
Don't freak out.

10:46.913 --> 10:47.646
Hardwood floors?

10:47.648 --> 10:51.182
I have hardwood floors?
This is awesome! What's that smell?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.218
Clean?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.252
Love it.
Ah!

10:54.254 --> 10:55.320
Well, this is
the easy part.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.023
The real trick is gonna
get the two of you to walk,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.758
talk, and squawk
like newlyweds.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.825
Carol. What do
you got for me?

11:00.827 --> 11:01.893
Complete bios
on Cameron and Molly.

11:01.895 --> 11:06.865
Family histories, pet peeves, personal stats,
hobbies, and sleeping habits.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.600
How do you know that?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.437
It's physically impossible
for anyone

11:12.439 --> 11:15.340
to learn all this information
in a few hours.

11:15.441 --> 11:18.943
Thanks to me,
you won't have to.

11:19.145 --> 11:19.711
Cam!
Oh.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.312
What's Molly's
mother's name? Quick.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.480
It... She...
Too slow!

11:22.482 --> 11:23.915
You blew it, man!
Now Molly's in prison,

11:23.917 --> 11:26.484
getting her hair braided
by her cell-mate queeny!

11:26.486 --> 11:28.053
Again, perhaps
it might be better

11:28.055 --> 11:29.220
if I just went home
to London.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.590
Nonsense, nonsense.
While you guys are being interrogated,

11:32.592 --> 11:34.025
just look to the wall
for your answers.

11:34.027 --> 11:39.330
See, right here we've got Big Momma
next to a map of...

11:39.332 --> 11:40.265
Florence.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.633
That's my mummy's name.

11:41.635 --> 11:42.333
Oz, that's brilliant.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.869
Little trick I learned from my
drinking buddies in the K.G.B.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.673
K.G.B.?
More like Keyser Soze.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.674
Okay, students.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.377
Today we're going to be
learning about chemistry,

11:52.379 --> 11:54.813
because you two
don't have any.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.114
You know
you're really in trouble

11:56.116 --> 12:01.586
when Buddy and Ricky have
more sexual tension between them

12:01.588 --> 12:02.454
than you two do.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.422
Does it tickle?

12:04.424 --> 12:08.293
Now show me what you got.
Come on. Bring me the heat.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.261
Okay. Chemistry. Right.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.930
So, um...
What?

12:11.932 --> 12:15.166
Maybe just around the...
around the back.

12:15.168 --> 12:15.967
There we go, yeah.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.536
Sorry. I... I grazed
some side boob.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.771
That's fine.
Don't do it again.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.940
Yes, do it again.
Do it right now!

12:21.942 --> 12:24.642
Grab her boobs!
This is your legal property.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.811
Absolutely not.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.146
Well...

12:28.148 --> 12:30.648
I did not want to
have to do this.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.017
Molly? Watch and learn.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.085
What?
Okay, I'm coming in.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.221
Oh, goodness.
We're here.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.021
Here we go.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.191
Ah. I want a raise.
I want a raise!

12:44.964 --> 12:47.398
Barkeep?
Another mudslide.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.034
Make it two. Hold the mud.
Double bourbon.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.504
Oz. What are
you doing here?

12:52.506 --> 12:54.239
I'm drinking
my wife away.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.408
Oh.
Marriage trouble, eh?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.076
Oof.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.746
Can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I can relate.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.682
I don't think I can go through
with this interview.

13:04.684 --> 13:08.453
Every fiber of my being
is telling me it's a mistake.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.687
Getting married
for a Green Card?

13:09.689 --> 13:14.159
Ah, don't beat yourself up.
I'm staying married for a chair.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.294
A chair?
Yeah.

13:16.296 --> 13:16.861
That's absurd.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.596
Hey, I prefer
my drinking partners

13:18.598 --> 13:21.566
to be a little
less judgmental.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.434
Sorry.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.769
But at least
my sham marriage

13:24.771 --> 13:27.505
helps me keep my life,
my job, and my friends.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.042
Well, sounds like
a pretty good deal to me.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.781
Yes, I suppose it does.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.386
Thank you, Oz.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.088
I hope you and your chair
are very happy together.

13:44.090 --> 13:48.560
<i>♪ I want to take</i>
<i>you away somehow ♪</i>

13:54.400 --> 13:56.234
Got your text.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.636
Come to your senses?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.371
The Con is yours.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.574
I don't even know
what that means.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.108
Then why do you
want the chair?

14:04.110 --> 14:06.845
Because driving you crazy
makes me hot.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.714
Must be quite cozy for you,
considering you are the devil.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.450
What can I say?
You bring out the worst in me.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.953
Really? Well, that would imply
that there is some good

14:14.955 --> 14:16.988
in that black,
twisted heart of yours.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.623
Oh, if I have
a black, twisted heart,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.258
it's because you put it there, mister.
Oh, please.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.527
Like everything is my...
I'll allow it! I'll allow it!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.662
I'll allow it! Stop saying that!
You know what?

14:24.664 --> 14:25.763
I hate you!

14:33.405 --> 14:35.473
Okay, guys.
We're almost done here.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.342
I have one more thing
to ask.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.810
How did you
pop the question?

14:38.812 --> 14:41.846
It's so romantic
to hear these stories.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.815
Yeah, um...

14:43.817 --> 14:47.018
Well, we were on
her father's ranch,

14:47.020 --> 14:47.886
riding horses,

14:47.888 --> 14:50.355
and as we reached
the river,

14:50.357 --> 14:55.159
I gazed deep into
Molly's blue eyes,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.762
and said, "Molly Hughes,

14:58.097 --> 14:58.763
<i>"will you be my wife?"</i>

14:58.765 --> 15:01.566
They've already answered 30 questions.
They're acing it.

15:01.568 --> 15:07.538
You know, I was skeptical
of this whole situation at first, but...

15:07.806 --> 15:10.909
I think you two
are a terrific couple.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.045
Yeah.
Thank you.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.580
So I think we're done.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.048
Yes.

15:17.050 --> 15:22.754
Oh, my. But, you know,
I do have one last question.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.590
Who made this
very interesting art piece?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.493
Our daughter made it.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.162
Oh. You have kids?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.563
Yes.
No.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.800
Well... She...
Molly's pregnant!

15:35.802 --> 15:37.802
What?
Yeah! Surprise!

15:37.804 --> 15:38.836
It's a boy!
Shut up.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.773
And a girl! And we...

15:41.775 --> 15:44.442
<i>All right. Well, it was</i>
<i>nice to talk to you.</i>

15:44.444 --> 15:44.943
Whoa.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.980
Now that is what I call chemistry.
No.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.686
I really gotta go.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.322
You said that
three sexes ago.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.325
I know.
I mean it this time, though.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.327
All right, well,
I'll have the chair wrapped up

16:02.329 --> 16:04.195
and delivered
to you tomorrow.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.196
Keep the chair, Oz.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.332
What? That's what
this whole thing was about.

16:07.334 --> 16:12.136
No. It was to see if you were
serious about ending this.

16:12.138 --> 16:16.541
The fact that you gave it to me
means that you are.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.711
Boop.

16:22.414 --> 16:23.948
I hate you.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.286
There you are.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.689
Oh, my God.How did this fit
in the microwave?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.225
I didn't do it
in the microwave, silly.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.059
I used the oven.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.327
I have an oven?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.629
Just consider it a "thank you"
for everything.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.166
Hey, you're the one who saved the day
with the kiss.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.534
Yes, um,
I'm sorry about that.

16:43.536 --> 16:48.172
I... I had to make it
look convincing.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.743
Oh. Uh, that's dessert.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.045
Only the very best for my hubby
from here on out.

16:54.047 --> 16:57.715
I don't know what
everyone's bitching about.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.584
Marriage is awesome.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.689
Uh...

17:08.560 --> 17:11.329
Oh. Damn it.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.032
Oh, God.

17:14.466 --> 17:15.066
What's up, man?

17:15.068 --> 17:18.736
Yeah, uh, I'm here to speak to
the woman of the house.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.505
What is that smell?

17:20.507 --> 17:22.740
It's my cologne.
It's Luke, by Mark Hamill.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.642
He sells it out
the trunk of his Corvette.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.543
He also sells fireworks.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.112
Listen, this is...
this is kind of a bad time.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.414
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

17:29.416 --> 17:32.717
Too bad, 'cause I'm here
to ask out your wife.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.318
Come on. Dude,
is this about the kiss?

17:34.320 --> 17:35.553
You know we had
to sell it.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.521
Oh, you sold it,
all right.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.956
You sold your best friend
down the river.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.492
Now step aside,
'cause I got a wife to woo.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.261
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

17:43.263 --> 17:43.995
Cameron, who is it?

17:43.997 --> 17:46.998
It's one of those, uh,
Jehovah's pizza guys

17:47.000 --> 17:48.466
selling girl scout
magazines.

17:48.468 --> 17:52.670
Oh, you better not close
that door. Oh, it is on!

17:56.208 --> 17:57.875
Cement? Really?

17:57.877 --> 18:00.611
Okay, so that's
how it's gonna be.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.513
Honey badger
don't give a damn.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.816
Okay. All right, fine.
You know what?

18:04.818 --> 18:05.550
Two can play this game.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.185
What do you got?
You got nothing.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.153
You can't beat
the prank master.

18:09.155 --> 18:09.787
Well, what's this?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.390
No. Put that down.
You're crossing the line.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.494
Mmm? Ooh.
Little ballroom dancing?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.696
No, he is not
a ballroom dancer!

18:18.698 --> 18:20.731
Oh, m'scrote!

18:20.733 --> 18:22.033
That is my destiny!

18:22.035 --> 18:23.000
Balls!

18:23.002 --> 18:23.601
Dude, give me that.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.937
He likes it.
He's building a home down there.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.972
Hey! Hey!
What is going on here?

18:27.974 --> 18:29.207
I'll tell you
what's going on.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.976
My best friend slammed the door
in my face 'cause of you.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.078
You know what?
Don't bring my wife into this!

18:34.080 --> 18:35.713
Fake wife!
Or so you claim!

18:35.715 --> 18:38.349
Oh, it feels so good
down here! Oh! Oh!

18:38.351 --> 18:40.284
Enough! Look!

18:40.286 --> 18:46.157
The whole point of this marriage was
for me to keep my friends,

18:46.159 --> 18:47.258
not split them up,

18:47.260 --> 18:52.130
but if this is how you're gonna act,
then I'm going home.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.368
"Going home"?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.704
I can't believe
I lost my crazy wife.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.906
I can't believe
I lost my fake wife.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.443
I can't believe
I lost my future wife.

19:05.445 --> 19:09.280
Can I give you sad sacks
a little advice?

19:09.282 --> 19:09.680
No.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.717
Let me tell you a little something
about the womens.

19:12.719 --> 19:17.088
Yeah, we be crazy.
Yeah, we be shopping.

19:17.289 --> 19:17.989
But you know what?

19:17.991 --> 19:21.959
At the end of the day,
we're romantics.

19:21.961 --> 19:26.197
We just want
to feel wanted.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.467
So if you really
want her back,

19:29.469 --> 19:32.303
why don't you
just go get her?

19:32.305 --> 19:36.407
That was actually some pretty sage advice,
Veronica.

19:37.110 --> 19:40.011
Yeah, I'm pretty baked
right now.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.648
Let's go.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.894
What the hell are
you doing here?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.297
I gave you what you wanted.

19:59.299 --> 19:59.897
No, you didn't,

19:59.899 --> 20:04.101
'cause I didn't know what I wanted
until right now.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.904
Amy Kyleen Osbourne,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.674
would you do me the honor
of not divorcing me?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.310
Wait, you want to
be married again?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.045
Hell, no.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.248
Then what are we?
I have no idea.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.655
We're just us.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.392
I'll allow it.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.629
Yeah, this is good
right here.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.264
Let's go.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.434
Can I help you?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.937
Mr. Hughes, we're here
for your daughter Molly.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.940
She lives in America.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.376
Well, yeah, she told us
she was going home.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.078
She hasn't told me that.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.780
Oh, bollocks.

20:49.782 --> 20:50.815
What? I...
I don't get it.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.819
Her apartment across the street
from work.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.422
Oh, bollocks!

20:58.590 --> 21:01.259
Would you like
a cup of tea?

21:04.330 --> 21:06.430
Oh, my God.
I spoke to my father.

21:06.432 --> 21:10.501
You two idiots went to London?
For me?

21:10.503 --> 21:13.671
Because I'm a terrible liar
and insanely jet-lagged,

21:13.673 --> 21:15.506
I'm just
gonna say, "Yes."

21:15.508 --> 21:19.443
Just when I think
I'm done with you two,

21:19.611 --> 21:21.579
you do something
like this,

21:21.581 --> 21:24.949
and I love you
even more.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.087
What the hell
does that mean?

21:30.089 --> 21:33.124
Dude, I don't even know
what day it is.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.825
She kissed me.
