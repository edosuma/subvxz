WEBVTT

00:14.633 --> 00:17.467
- STUPID WEDDINGS.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.833
- HERE THEY ARE!
AREN'T THEY BEAU--

00:19.833 --> 00:21.000
RAY!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.800
I LEFT YOU UP HERE
AN HOUR AGO.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.067
I SHOWERED, DID MY HAIR,

00:25.067 --> 00:26.667
GOT THE KIDS UP,
GOT THEM DRESSED.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.333
KIDS, GO DOWNSTAIRS.
MOMMY'S YELLING.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.767
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN
DO YOURSELF?

00:30.767 --> 00:33.033
- WHAT?
I'M READY.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.333
- EVERYONE IS WAITING
FOR YOU.

00:34.333 --> 00:35.733
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

00:35.733 --> 00:39.067
LOOK, THIS GOES ON
AFTER THE PANTS, EINSTEIN.

00:39.067 --> 00:40.267
HERE, GET--

00:40.267 --> 00:44.333
DO YOU REALIZE
THAT IT IS A--

00:44.333 --> 00:47.733
IT'S A THREE-HOUR DRIVE
TO PENNSYLVANIA.

00:47.733 --> 00:49.300
AMY IS WAITING FOR ME.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.233
ROBERT IS A NERVOUS WRECK.
I MEAN, COME ON.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.500
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:54.500 --> 00:58.967
YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO ANGRY
TO DO THE ZIPPER.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.700
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

01:00.700 --> 01:01.967
- I GOT THE SPEECH--

01:01.967 --> 01:03.533
THE FRICKING TOAST THING
I GOT TO DO.

01:03.533 --> 01:05.800
- WOULD YOU STOP OBSESSING
ABOUT THE TOAST?

01:05.800 --> 01:07.867
JUST SAY SOMETHING
FUNNY AND HEARTFELT.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.233
NOBODY CARES.

01:11.233 --> 01:12.233
- WHERE IS HE?

01:12.233 --> 01:15.167
- HE'S STILL IN THERE.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.800
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:17.800 --> 01:18.933
- WHAT?
I'M COMING.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.467
- WOULD YOU HURRY?

01:20.467 --> 01:22.367
MA'S ALREADY YELLING AT DAD,
BECAUSE HE DRIPPED

01:22.367 --> 01:25.200
EGG AND CHEESE SANDWICH
ON HIS TUX.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.500
JUST GET IN THE VAN!

01:26.500 --> 01:28.367
THIS IS THE BIGGEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

01:28.367 --> 01:32.467
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
AT YOUR LAST WEDDING.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.700
- WHAT'S THAT,
A SMART REMARK?

01:35.700 --> 01:37.033
- NO.
- HUH?

01:37.033 --> 01:39.900
YOU'RE BRINGING UP
MY FIRST MARRIAGE TODAY, HUH?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.200
YOU TRYING TO JINX ME, RAYMOND?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.633
- NO.
NO.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.367
- DON'T MESS WITH ME TODAY,
RAYMOND, OKAY?

01:44.367 --> 01:48.500
- I'M JUST--
- DO NOT MESS WITH ME TODAY!

01:48.500 --> 01:52.300
THIS IS MY WEDDING DAY,
AND I'M IN NO MOOD FOR FUN!

01:55.733 --> 01:58.300
- THEN YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE MARRIAGE.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.267
- [breathing heavily]

02:13.200 --> 02:14.667
[knock on door]

02:14.667 --> 02:18.267
- ROBBIE?

02:18.267 --> 02:20.667
- MA, THIS IS THE MEN'S ROOM.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.633
- RAYMOND TOLD ME
YOU WERE IN HERE.

02:22.633 --> 02:23.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:23.933 --> 02:25.433
- NOTHING, MA.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.733
I JUST WANTED A LITTLE
ALONE TIME BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

02:27.733 --> 02:28.733
- OH, OKAY.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.833
I'LL STAY WITH YOU.

02:31.833 --> 02:35.467
CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

02:35.467 --> 02:37.933
- NO, MA, I WANT
TO STAY IN HERE.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.500
REMEMBER LAST TIME
I GOT MARRIED,

02:39.500 --> 02:41.000
I SAW JOANNE
BEFORE THE WEDDING?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.167
I THINK THAT PUT THE WHAMMY
ON THE WHOLE MARRIAGE.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.900
- OH, HONEY.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.367
THE PROBLEM THERE WAS,
YOU SAW HER AFTER THE WEDDING.

02:50.433 --> 02:51.900
- ALL RIGHT,
OUT, MOM.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.833
- NO, BUT--
- NO, COME ON.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.367
YOU ALREADY GOT GIANNI
LOOKING FOR A FIRE HYDRANT.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.633
COME ON.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.633
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,
YOU WANT TO HELP?

02:59.633 --> 03:01.367
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THE REVEREND GUY, OKAY?

03:01.367 --> 03:03.000
HE'LL BE THE ONE
WITH THE BIG BOOK.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.633
- YEAH, BUT I NEED TO TALK TO--
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.100
- WHOA, THANKS, MAN.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.567
- YEAH, ALWAYS HAPPY
TO DO THAT.

03:10.567 --> 03:11.567
SO HOW YOU DOING?

03:11.567 --> 03:14.567
YOU FAST, YOU LOOSE,
YOU THROWING UP?

03:14.567 --> 03:15.933
- I'M FINE.

03:15.933 --> 03:19.000
YOU KNOW, JUST WANTED
A LITTLE ALONE TIME, THAT'S ALL.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.267
- YEAH.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

03:22.267 --> 03:25.633
NOW THAT YOU AND AMY
ARE GETTING MARRIED,

03:25.633 --> 03:29.167
WHAT'S THE ONE
"SPECIAL THING"

03:29.167 --> 03:31.433
THAT YOU TWO HAVE

03:31.433 --> 03:34.767
THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE
WOULD WANT TO HEAR ABOUT?

03:38.367 --> 03:39.933
- YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
FOR THE TOAST.

03:39.933 --> 03:42.600
- I GOT PLENTY.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.567
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

03:46.933 --> 03:49.467
- OH!

03:49.467 --> 03:51.533
GREAT.
YOU'RE BOTH HERE.

03:51.533 --> 03:52.333
- YEAH.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.500
- HOW'S IT GOING?

03:55.500 --> 03:56.633
- FINE, PETER.

03:56.633 --> 03:57.633
WHAT IS IT?

03:57.633 --> 03:59.033
- WELL, NOTHING.

03:59.033 --> 04:02.267
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU TWO
BEFORE BLASTOFF AND EVERYTHING.

04:02.267 --> 04:03.967
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE TUX?

04:03.967 --> 04:07.367
I RENTED IT.
[clears throat]

04:07.367 --> 04:10.833
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD FIT.
- THANK YOU.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.667
GUYS, LOOK, THIS IS
REALLY HARD FOR ME.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.833
UM, I'VE HAD SOME ISSUES

04:15.833 --> 04:17.400
WITH THIS WHOLE
MARRIAGE AGENDA,

04:17.400 --> 04:20.167
BUT I'VE HAD SOME TIME
TO REFLECT,

04:20.167 --> 04:26.033
AND I REALIZE THAT
I MAY HAVE BEEN A WIENER.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.733
- NO, THAT'S OKAY, PETER.

04:27.733 --> 04:28.733
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.200
WE'RE GONNA BE FAMILY,

04:30.200 --> 04:34.033
AND I JUST--I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO CALL YOU GUYS--

04:34.033 --> 04:36.800
BOTH OF YOU,

04:36.800 --> 04:39.933
BROTHER-MAN.

04:39.933 --> 04:40.933
- ALL RIGHT.

04:40.933 --> 04:42.167
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

04:42.167 --> 04:43.633
- [sobbing]
WELCOME TO OUR LIVES.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.400
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

04:45.400 --> 04:46.667
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.500
THANK YOU, PETER.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.933
AND NOW I SHALL
TAKE MY LEAVE.

04:51.933 --> 04:54.133
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

04:57.367 --> 05:02.733
- THAT PSYCHO'S
GONNA PULL SOME CRAP.

05:02.733 --> 05:03.733
RIGHT?
- YUP.

05:03.733 --> 05:04.900
- NOW, LISTEN.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.200
YOU GOT TO STICK
WITH HIM, RAYMOND.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.433
GO. GO NOW.
YOU GOT TO FOLLOW HIM.

05:07.433 --> 05:08.733
- I DON'T WANT TO BE--

05:08.733 --> 05:10.267
- NO, NO, LISTEN, LISTEN,
JUST DO IT.

05:10.267 --> 05:11.767
HE'S GONNA
WRECK THE WEDDING.

05:11.767 --> 05:15.500
THAT GUY HAS SQUIRRELS
JUGGLING KNIVES IN HIS HEAD.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.200
- NO, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.133
BEFORE I GO, ONE THING FUNNY
AND THEN HEARTFELT.

05:19.133 --> 05:22.567
- GO!

05:22.567 --> 05:23.767
- LOOK OUT.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.700
I GOT EGG AND CHEESE SANDWICH
ON MY CROTCH.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.833
- OH, GREAT.
GREAT!

05:28.833 --> 05:30.200
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.667
- NOTHING.
NOTHING, DAD.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.700
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

05:33.700 --> 05:34.867
- NONE TOO HAPPY.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.500
I JUST FOUND OUT
IT'S GONNA BE A CASH BAR.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.267
AND THE SCUTTLEBUTT IS,
THE FOOD WILL BE SKIMPY.

05:42.267 --> 05:43.833
- YEAH, AND OF COURSE,
THE ONLY REASON

05:43.833 --> 05:44.933
WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY

05:44.933 --> 05:46.900
IS SO YOU CAN
STUFF YOUR FACE.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.433
- I ENJOY LIFE.

05:49.433 --> 05:54.900
SO ANYWAY, NO OFFENSE,
BUT THE PARTY'S GONNA BLOW.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.733
- WELL, I THINK IT'S NICE
THAT THE MACDOUGALLS

05:56.733 --> 05:59.633
HAVE OFFERED TO HELP ME AND AMY
PAY FOR THE WEDDING AT ALL.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.267
- YOU SAYING I SHOULD'VE
CHIPPED IN?

06:01.267 --> 06:02.600
- NO.
[stammers]

06:02.600 --> 06:04.200
- I CHIPPED IN
YOUR LAST WEDDING

06:04.200 --> 06:06.000
AND RAY'S WEDDING.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.467
AND BY THE WAY,

06:07.467 --> 06:10.867
THE BROAD'S FAMILY
IS SUPPOSED TO PAY,

06:10.867 --> 06:14.267
AND IT IS TO BE
A FULL BAR

06:14.267 --> 06:16.233
FREE OF CHARGE

06:16.233 --> 06:19.100
WITH TOP-SHELF HOOCH.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.400
READ YOUR BIBLE.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.433
- MUST'VE MISSED THAT PASSAGE.

06:27.433 --> 06:30.567
- YOU GOT SOME NERVE COMPLAINING
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ENOUGH.

06:30.567 --> 06:32.767
NEED I REMIND YOU
OF 40 YEARS OF ROOM

06:32.767 --> 06:37.100
AND ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF BOARD?

06:37.100 --> 06:40.267
- LOOK, DAD, DAD,
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.500
I'M JUST A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW--

06:41.500 --> 06:43.000
I WANT IT TO GO WELL TODAY,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.600
SO I APOLOGIZE.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.867
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING,

06:45.867 --> 06:50.500
AND YOU'RE A SENSATIONAL FATHER.

06:50.500 --> 06:54.633
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I APOLOGIZE TOO.

06:54.633 --> 06:56.333
I GUESS EVERYONE'S
KIND OF ON EDGE TODAY,

06:56.333 --> 06:57.700
BUT YOU'LL BE OKAY.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.733
YOU'RE USED TO THIS
TYPE OF THING,

06:59.733 --> 07:03.533
BEING A COP,
SEEING MURDERS, AND WHATNOT.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.133
- THANKS.

07:12.133 --> 07:15.567
I FEEL BETTER.

07:15.567 --> 07:16.767

08:07.733 --> 08:09.767
DOESN'T AMY LOOK BEAUTIFUL?
- YEAH.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.433
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I HAVE BEEN SO EXCITED.

08:11.433 --> 08:14.367
IT'S SO ROMANTIC.
EVERYBODY'S CRYING.

08:14.367 --> 08:17.367
- THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
- YEAH.

08:17.367 --> 08:20.433
YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.900
OH, I AM JUST GONNA

NO, IT'S JUST--

08:30.733 --> 08:31.867
COME ON!

08:31.867 --> 08:34.367
IT'S A WEDDING.
GET INTO IT.

08:34.367 --> 08:37.567
YOU KNOW, THE ROMANCE,
THE LOVE THAT'S ALL AROUND US.

08:37.567 --> 08:41.167
CAN'T YOU SUCK IT UP
FOR ONE DAY?

08:41.167 --> 08:45.467
- I'M INTO IT.
I'M SUCKING.

08:45.467 --> 08:48.200
- YOU'RE DANCING
WITH ME TODAY, JERKWAD.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.433
- YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME THAT
SINCE OUR WEDDING.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.233
- AMY, WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.467
- OH, SHE'S RUNNING AROUND

08:59.467 --> 09:01.233
LIKE A HEADLESS CHICKEN
MAKING SURE...

09:01.233 --> 09:02.667
[imitating mother]
ALL THE RELATIVES

09:02.667 --> 09:04.600
ARE COMFORTABLE
AND ARE SEATED PROPERLY.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.900
[all laugh]

09:06.900 --> 09:08.800
OH, DEAR, TINY AUNT FLORENCE.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.200
CAN YOU SEE FROM THERE?

09:10.200 --> 09:13.233
WOULD YOU LIKE A CUSHION
OR A PHONE BOOK?

09:13.233 --> 09:14.967
[all laugh]

09:14.967 --> 09:18.733
[normal voice]
HI, MOM!

09:18.733 --> 09:21.800
- HELLO.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.133
- I'M SORRY, MOTHER.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.300
YOU KNOW I WAS
JUST FOOLING AROUND.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.900
- OH, I KNOW, HONEY.
THAT NEVER BOTHERS ME.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.767
AND YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT.

09:31.767 --> 09:37.533
AND YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL TODAY, AND--

09:37.533 --> 09:38.967
[sobbing]

09:38.967 --> 09:41.167
- WHAT?
WHAT?

09:41.167 --> 09:43.333
- I'M SORRY.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.867
I GUESS I PICTURED
MY LITTLE GIRL'S WEDDING

09:45.867 --> 09:49.167
A CERTAIN WAY.

09:49.167 --> 09:51.033
I USED TO WORRY
ABOUT TELLING YOU

09:51.033 --> 09:52.967
WHAT TO EXPECT--

09:52.967 --> 09:57.133
YOU KNOW,
ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT?

09:59.067 --> 10:02.933
BUT YOU AND ROBERT
HAVE ALREADY--

10:02.933 --> 10:04.933
- MOTHER, PLEASE!

10:04.933 --> 10:06.300
- I'M SORRY.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.967
YOU'RE RIGHT, SWEETIE.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.100
I KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.733
ALL FUN ALL THE TIME.

10:17.967 --> 10:20.233
BUT LOOK AT YOU.

10:20.233 --> 10:23.533
YOU'RE LIKE AN ANGEL
DROPPED FROM HEAVEN,

10:23.533 --> 10:27.733
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THAT
FOR ME AND YOUR FATHER.

10:27.733 --> 10:31.600
- THANKS, MOM.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.900
- I'D BETTER GO.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.933
THAT PHONE BOOK FOR
AUNT FLORENCE IS A GOOD IDEA.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.800
OH, MY, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GET STARTED IN FIVE MINUTES,

10:39.800 --> 10:42.100
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
REVEREND STEVENS YET.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.100
PETER?

10:43.100 --> 10:46.267
- YES, MAMA?

10:46.267 --> 10:48.567
- HONEY, YOU PICKED UP
REVEREND STEVENS THIS MORNING,

10:48.567 --> 10:49.600
DIDN'T YOU?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.667
- WHY, YES, OF COURSE,
I DID, MAMA.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.767
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT RASCAL
COULD'VE GOTTEN TO,

10:55.767 --> 10:57.133
BUT I'M ON IT.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.233
- DID PETER COME IN HERE?

11:08.233 --> 11:10.833
- YEAH, HE'S IN THERE.

11:10.833 --> 11:15.200
- PETER?

11:15.200 --> 11:18.033
COME ON, PETER,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.933
- I'M VERY BUSY.

11:20.933 --> 11:22.367
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:22.367 --> 11:24.233
- HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO PICK UP THE REVEREND GUY,

11:24.233 --> 11:26.067
AND NOBODY CAN FIND HIM.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.033
- PETER, COME OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW!

11:28.033 --> 11:30.633
- LET'S GO!
- I CAN SEE YOU!

11:35.067 --> 11:37.733
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

11:37.733 --> 11:39.067
- AH, REVEREND STEVENS.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.700
- SOMEBODY WAS SUPPOSED
TO PICK ME UP.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.033
I HAD TO HITCHHIKE.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.233
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.700
- WELL, GEE,
WHO DID I PICK UP, THEN?

11:56.933 --> 11:59.667
[scoffs]

11:59.667 --> 12:00.533
[knocking at door]

12:00.533 --> 12:03.167
- PETER?
ARE YOU IN THERE, PETER?

12:03.167 --> 12:06.167
- YES, MAMA, I AM.
COME ON IN.

12:06.167 --> 12:07.367
- OH, HELLO.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.867
PETER, WE FOUND
REVEREND STEVENS.

12:08.867 --> 12:09.867
YOU CAN STOP LOOKING.

12:09.867 --> 12:12.367
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.233
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
IN HERE?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.000
- YES, EVERYTHING'S FINE, MAMA.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.033
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

12:18.033 --> 12:20.267
HEY, I THINK
IT'S WEDDING TIME,

12:20.267 --> 12:21.300
ISN'T IT?

12:21.300 --> 12:24.800
PLACES, EVERYONE.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.300
OH, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

12:31.033 --> 12:34.033
["Here Comes the Bride" playing]

12:34.033 --> 12:40.167
[processional organ music]

13:12.667 --> 13:13.967
- GOOD MORNING.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.767
all: GOOD MORNING.

13:15.767 --> 13:20.333
- WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

13:20.333 --> 13:23.333
TO JOIN TOGETHER IN MARRIAGE

13:23.333 --> 13:26.100
ROBERT CHARLES BARONE

13:26.100 --> 13:29.433
AND AMY LOUISE MACDOUGALL.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.700
IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE
WHO KNOWS ANY REASON

13:31.700 --> 13:36.200
WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
BE JOINED IN HOLY MATRIMONY,

13:36.200 --> 13:39.167
LET THEM SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.533
WE WILL BEGIN THIS MORNING--

13:47.533 --> 13:48.633
- EXCUSE ME.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.467
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.

14:01.567 --> 14:04.267
- PARDON ME?
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:04.267 --> 14:09.433
- I'M SORRY, BUT I FEEL THE NEED
TO SAY SOMETHING.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.400
- MA!

14:21.367 --> 14:24.100
- DID YOU BRING YOUR GUN?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.400
WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?

14:33.400 --> 14:37.767
- I DON'T KNOW.
THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

14:37.767 --> 14:41.967
WELL, I GUESS, SPEAK NOW.

14:41.967 --> 14:45.267
- WELL, I WANTED TO SPEAK
TO ROBBIE BEFORE THE CEREMONY,

14:45.267 --> 14:46.600
BUT HE DIDN'T
GIVE ME A CHANCE

14:46.600 --> 14:49.400
WHEN WE WERE
IN THE BATHROOM TOGETHER.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.967
- DID SHE DO THIS TO YOU?

14:53.967 --> 14:56.667
- HONEY, THIS IS
ONLY THE BEGINNING.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.567
- I'M JUST SO WORRIED

15:02.567 --> 15:05.033
THAT ROBBIE MIGHT
ONLY BE GETTING MARRIED TODAY

15:05.033 --> 15:06.333
BECAUSE OF ME.

15:06.333 --> 15:10.167
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:10.167 --> 15:12.367
- I MAY HAVE PRESSURED YOU
INTO GETTING MARRIED

15:12.367 --> 15:14.267
AND YOU WEREN'T READY YET.

15:14.267 --> 15:17.733
AND I NEED TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY SON, DON'T I?

15:17.733 --> 15:20.567
- COULD IT NOT BE TODAY?

15:27.833 --> 15:29.200
- I'M SORRY.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.733
YOU KNOW I NEVER
LIKE TO INTERFERE.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.300
BUT I PUSHED YOU
BECAUSE I WAS SO WORRIED

15:37.300 --> 15:39.567
THAT YOU'D WIND UP WITH NOBODY,

15:39.567 --> 15:42.667
AND EVEN THOUGH
THIS IS WONDERFUL AND--

15:45.433 --> 15:47.933
AND I'M THRILLED
TO BE HERE

15:47.933 --> 15:49.700
AND I LOVE AMY--

15:49.700 --> 15:51.033
HI, AMY--

15:55.267 --> 15:57.433
BUT IT ALL
HAPPENED SO FAST,

15:57.433 --> 16:01.133
I'M NOT SURE HOW AMY'S FAMILY
FEELS ABOUT YOU.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.300
- MA, THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.500
- HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.400
OF COURSE IT'S MY BUSINESS.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.167
YOU'RE MY SON.
YOU'RE MY BUSINESS.

16:10.167 --> 16:13.700
- DO YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU HAVE RUINED

16:13.700 --> 16:17.600
EVERY SINGLE EVENT
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.167
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET ABOUT?

16:19.167 --> 16:21.133
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.433
- THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAY?

16:29.433 --> 16:33.033
YOU TRIED TO PUT
DIFFERENT PANTS ON ME.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.733
- YOU GOT YOURS DIRTY.

16:34.733 --> 16:37.033
ANY MOTHER
WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME.

16:37.033 --> 16:41.667
- NOT WHILE I WAS ONSTAGE!

16:41.667 --> 16:42.633
HUH?

16:42.633 --> 16:45.700
YOU DON'T SEE
A PATTERN HERE?

16:48.933 --> 16:51.100
- A PATTERN OF LOVE.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.667
I MEAN, FOR YEARS,
I KEPT THINKING,

16:52.667 --> 16:55.300
IF ONLY I HAD SPOKEN UP
AT YOUR FIRST WEDDING

16:55.300 --> 16:57.100
TO THAT TERRIBLE DANCER.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.533
AND AS I RECALL--

17:04.967 --> 17:06.333
AS I RECALL,

17:06.333 --> 17:08.400
YOU WERE FINE
WITH ME INTERFERING

17:08.400 --> 17:11.800
WHEN YOU NEEDED SOMEONE TO THROW
THAT HUSSY OUT OF THE HOUSE.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.233
NOT THAT THAT WOULD
EVER HAPPEN HERE, DEAR.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.933
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

17:21.933 --> 17:24.933
I LOVE YOU,
AND I LOVE AMY,

17:24.933 --> 17:26.600
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

17:26.600 --> 17:30.433
THAT YOU'RE MARRYING TODAY
FOR LOVE AND ONLY FOR LOVE,

17:30.433 --> 17:33.967
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
A MARRIAGE CAN STAY TOGETHER.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.233
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, FRANK?

17:35.233 --> 17:37.733
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, LADY.

17:51.100 --> 17:54.833
- ROBBIE, I SAID
WHAT I HAD TO SAY,

17:54.833 --> 17:56.467
AND IT CAME FROM LOVE.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.200
NOW YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.633
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

18:02.633 --> 18:03.900
I FEEL BETTER NOW.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.433
GO AHEAD, REVEREND.

18:22.233 --> 18:24.633
- OKAY, WE'RE BACK.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.667
- ALL RIGHT!

18:30.667 --> 18:34.367
AND NOW, HERE THEY ARE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

18:34.367 --> 18:36.733
FOR THE FIRST TIME ANYWHERE,

18:36.733 --> 18:39.067
ROBERT AND AMY BARONE!

18:39.067 --> 18:41.133
[applause]

18:41.133 --> 18:46.400
[jazzy wedding march playing]

18:46.400 --> 18:49.600
ALL RIGHT, AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

18:49.600 --> 18:52.533
THE BUFFET IS OPEN.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.033
- HI!

19:00.033 --> 19:03.767
- HI!
- HI.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.133
- SO...

19:06.133 --> 19:08.667
FEEL DIFFERENT?

19:08.667 --> 19:11.567
- YEAH.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.333
- LIFE IS GOOD.

19:23.767 --> 19:24.767
- YES.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.333
YOU'RE MARRIED.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.300
YOU TWO LOOKED BEAUTIFUL
UP THERE,

19:28.300 --> 19:32.700
AND...YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HEALTH.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.667
- OH, HELLO!

19:35.667 --> 19:39.100
OH, I THOUGHT
THE CEREMONY WAS BEAUTIFUL.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.367
DIDN'T YOU, ROBBIE?

19:40.367 --> 19:43.233
- I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

19:43.233 --> 19:45.300
- I AM SO HAPPY.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.767
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:46.767 --> 19:48.467
I'M ACTUALLY STARVING.

19:48.467 --> 19:52.600
I FORGOT TO EAT TODAY,
WHAT WITH ALL I HAD TO DO.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.267
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.500
- HEY, CAN I HAVE
A BEER?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.667
- SURE.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.200
THAT'S $3, SIR.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.467
- JEEZALOO!

20:08.467 --> 20:11.400
HEY, LOOK.
TELL YOU WHAT.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.667
I THINK I LEFT
MY WALLET AT HOME

20:12.667 --> 20:15.367
WHEN I CHANGED
INTO THE MONKEY SUIT.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.233
COULD YOU
LET ONE SLIDE?

20:17.233 --> 20:18.833
- I'M SORRY, SIR.
I'M NOT ALLOWED.

20:18.833 --> 20:21.367
- AW, COME ON.
COME ON.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.367
LISTEN, PAL, I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE RULES ARE

20:23.367 --> 20:26.700
AT THIS STINKING
HUMP OF A WEDDING.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.767
I AM THE FATHER
OF THE GIGANTIC GROOM...

20:31.100 --> 20:33.133
AND I WANT BEER NOW.

20:33.133 --> 20:36.667
BEER NOW, BEER NOW!

20:36.667 --> 20:38.867
- HERE.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.333
PLEASE, LET ME.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.533
- UH, THAT'S OKAY.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.067
- NO, FRANK, PLEASE.
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

20:45.067 --> 20:48.800
- WELL, UH,
THANKS THERE, HANK.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.233
- SURE.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.167
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
THAT OUR TWO FAMILIES

20:52.167 --> 20:57.867
SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN OFF ON SUCH
A WRONG...WHAT'S THE WORD?

20:57.867 --> 21:00.767
FOOT.

21:00.767 --> 21:03.900
I MEAN, I LIKE TO THINK
THAT I'M A NICE FELLA,

21:03.900 --> 21:07.667
AND I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT
TO FIND THE GOOD IN PEOPLE,

21:07.667 --> 21:10.300
AND I WOULD LIKE TO
IN YOU, FRANK.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.900
- WELL, I THINK YOU ARE
A NICE FELLA, HANK.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.433
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,

21:17.433 --> 21:19.167
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
MUCH GOOD IN PEOPLE

21:19.167 --> 21:20.800
WHEN THEY DRIVE
ALL THE WAY TO PENNSYLVANIA

21:20.800 --> 21:22.000
FOR A BIG, LONG WEDDING

21:22.000 --> 21:23.600
AND YOU SCREW THEM
ON THE BOOZE.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.833
- WELL.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.167
- "WELL"?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.433
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

21:35.433 --> 21:36.633
"WELL"?

21:36.633 --> 21:37.933
- YES, BECAUSE "WELL"

21:37.933 --> 21:40.000
IS WHAT ONE SAYS
WHEN ONE IS SHOCKED

21:40.000 --> 21:41.400
BUT NOT
PARTICULARLY SURPRISED

21:41.400 --> 21:43.733
BY SOMEONE'S
BOORISH BEHAVIOR.

21:43.733 --> 21:45.133
WELL.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.633
- [laughs]

21:46.633 --> 21:48.700
THAT IS SO FRICKING SAD.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.900
- OH, YES, FRANK,
THAT'S SAD?

21:53.900 --> 21:56.700
WELL, I WANT
MY MONEY BACK.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.800
NOW WHO'S SAD?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.167
OH, MR. BARTENDER,

22:00.167 --> 22:01.967
DON'T GIVE THIS MAN
ANY ALCOHOL.

22:01.967 --> 22:03.567
HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD
MORE THAN ENOUGH

22:03.567 --> 22:05.067
OVER THE COURSE
OF HIS LIFE.

22:05.067 --> 22:06.267
- I'M A VETERAN!

22:06.267 --> 22:08.267
- A VETERAN
OF THE BAD MANNERS ARMY.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.300
- TAKE A HIKE, BOY SCOUT!

22:09.300 --> 22:10.333
- I'LL TAKE A HIKE WHEN...

22:10.333 --> 22:12.200
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
HOLD IT!

22:12.200 --> 22:14.600
BACK IT UP, CALM IT DOWN,

22:14.600 --> 22:20.533
AND TAKE A LOOK AT ALL
THE PEOPLE AT THE WEDDING.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.633
- THIS PHONY HOLY MAN
AND HIS LIQUOR GOUGING

22:22.633 --> 22:25.300
HAVE RUINED
AN OTHERWISE HAPPY OCCASION.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.200
SO LONG, CHEAPSKATE.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.667
- HE GETS EMOTIONAL
AT WEDDINGS.

22:37.067 --> 22:39.167
- MARIE, I NEED
TO SAY SOMETHING.

22:39.167 --> 22:42.600
- I KNOW.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS FOOD?

22:42.600 --> 22:44.367
- MARIE, WE'RE LEAVING.
DROP THE MEAT.

22:44.367 --> 22:47.600
- WHAT?
WE CAN'T LEAVE.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.533
I'M THE MOTHER
OF THE GROOM.

22:49.533 --> 22:51.200
NO MATTER HOW HORRIBLE
THE FOOD IS,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.400
I HAVE TO STAY.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.933
- HELLO.

22:54.933 --> 22:58.867
- OH, PAT,
WHAT A WONDERFUL SPREAD.

22:58.867 --> 23:00.567
- THANK YOU, MARIE,

23:00.567 --> 23:03.100
BUT PERHAPS
FRANK IS RIGHT.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.533
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.000
- WHAT?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.867
- YOU KNOW, THIS WEDDING,
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

23:09.867 --> 23:12.100
WAS FOR AMY AND ROBERT,

23:12.100 --> 23:13.500
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
INTRUDED

23:13.500 --> 23:16.733
ON THEIR MOMENT OF HAPPINESS
IN THE CHAPEL.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.633
- I WAS DOING IT FOR THEM.

23:18.633 --> 23:24.033
- OH, MARIE, I THINK MAYBE
YOU WERE DOING IT FOR YOU,

23:24.033 --> 23:25.500
AND YOU WERE
SO BUSY THINKING

23:25.500 --> 23:27.467
ABOUT WHAT YOU NEEDED
TO EXPRESS,

23:27.467 --> 23:29.333
YOU WEREN'T THINKING
ABOUT ANYONE ELSE,

23:29.333 --> 23:31.667
INCLUDING YOUR SON.

23:31.667 --> 23:35.233
I THINK THAT'S CALLED
NARCISSISM.

23:43.967 --> 23:45.133
- ALL RIGHT.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.633
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.733
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE,
PLEASE, MRS. MACDOUGALL?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.567
NOBODY'S EVER
SAID THAT TO HER BEFORE.

24:02.767 --> 24:06.467
YOU'RE COOL.

24:06.467 --> 24:11.200
- THANK YOU, RAY,
BUT I DON'T FEEL COOL.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.033
I FEEL LIKE
I JUST CONTRIBUTED

24:13.033 --> 24:14.933
TO THE WHOLE TONE
OF THE WEDDING,

24:14.933 --> 24:17.867
WHICH IS BAD.

24:17.867 --> 24:19.267
IT'S RUINED,

24:19.267 --> 24:20.967
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
I WANTED TO DO

24:20.967 --> 24:24.033
FOR MY DAUGHTER
AND HER NEW HUSBAND.

24:27.267 --> 24:29.533
- WHY DO I TALK TO PEOPLE?

24:31.233 --> 24:32.833
LISTEN--
- OKAY, EVERYBODY.

24:32.833 --> 24:35.300
IT'S TIME FOR THE TOAST
FROM THE BEST MAN.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.267
LET'S GIVE A BIG
BARONE-MACDOUGALL WELCOME

24:38.267 --> 24:39.767
TO LITTLE BROTHER RAYMOND.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.133
COME ON, EVERYBODY,
BRING HIM UP HERE!

24:42.133 --> 24:45.267
[applause]

24:50.067 --> 24:52.500
- HEY.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.567
UH...

24:53.567 --> 24:55.133
[clears throat]

24:55.133 --> 24:56.600
WELL, I GOT TO BE HONEST.

24:56.600 --> 25:00.500
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY TODAY.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.633
UH...

25:02.633 --> 25:04.233
I WANTED TO DO
A NICE TOAST,

25:04.233 --> 25:06.167
BUT EVERYBODY
DOES A NICE TOAST.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.833
BUT I WANTED IT
TO BE SPECIAL,

25:08.833 --> 25:11.267
'CAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL DAY
FOR MY BROTHER, ROBERT,

25:11.267 --> 25:14.200
AND HIS NEW WIFE, AMY.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.367
SO, UH...

25:16.367 --> 25:18.700
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

25:22.433 --> 25:27.700
BUT THEN SOMETIMES MATERIAL

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
PRESENTS ITSELF.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.200
LIKE TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE--

25:37.200 --> 25:39.567
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

25:39.567 --> 25:41.767
BUT I THINK I CAN
PUT A GOOD SPIN ON IT.

25:41.767 --> 25:43.400
I THINK, UH...

25:43.400 --> 25:47.433
I THINK THERE'S ONE THING
THAT CAN MAKE IT ALL BETTER:

25:47.433 --> 25:49.533
EDITING.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.400
YES, I THINK THERE'S A PORTION
OF TODAY'S CEREMONY

25:54.400 --> 25:57.733
THAT WE WON'T NEED TO SAVE
ON THE VIDEOTAPE.

25:59.533 --> 26:01.233
EDITING.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.467
YOU KNOW, ROBERT AND I,

26:03.467 --> 26:05.200
WHEN WE REMEMBER
OUR CHILDHOOD,

26:05.200 --> 26:07.633
WE KIND OF USE
THAT TECHNOLOGY

26:07.633 --> 26:10.333
IN OUR HEADS.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.000
YOU KNOW, WE ONLY REMEMBER
THE GOOD STUFF,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.633
LIKE THE FOOD.

26:14.633 --> 26:16.733
YEAH, WE DON'T REMEMBER
WHEN MOM WOULD YELL AT DAD

26:16.733 --> 26:19.833
NOT TO SCRATCH HIS REAR END
WITH A SPATULA...

26:19.833 --> 26:23.067
[laughter]

26:23.067 --> 26:26.367
IN THE BAKERY.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.133
EDITING.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.267
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

26:32.267 --> 26:33.767
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS
OUR FAMILY

26:33.767 --> 26:36.567
PROBABLY WASN'T SURPRISED
BY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

26:36.567 --> 26:38.567
I MEAN, AMY KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS GETTING INTO

26:38.567 --> 26:40.600
WHEN SHE MARRIED
INTO THIS FAMILY,

26:40.600 --> 26:42.333
AND THAT'S WHY I GOT HER
A WEDDING GIFT

26:42.333 --> 26:44.033
I KNOW SHE CAN USE:

26:44.033 --> 26:46.233
CYANIDE.

26:51.533 --> 26:52.767
YEAH.

26:52.767 --> 26:54.000
AND BY THE WAY,
ROBERT,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.267
IF YOU THINK
IT WAS ANNOYING TODAY

26:55.267 --> 26:57.333
WHEN MOM INTERRUPTED
THE CEREMONY,

26:57.333 --> 27:01.300
WAIT TILL SHE INTERRUPTS
TONIGHT, YEAH.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.033
YEAH, "I GOT TO SAY, ROBERT,

27:04.033 --> 27:06.300
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE DOING THAT CORRECTLY."

27:08.300 --> 27:10.933
SHE'S INVOLVED, OUR MOM.

27:10.933 --> 27:14.333
I LIKED IT TODAY
WHEN MY MOM SAID,

27:14.333 --> 27:15.667
"I'M A MOTHER.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.733
YOU ARE MY BUSINESS."

27:16.733 --> 27:18.300
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR, MA?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.567
YOUR "GOING OUT
OF BUSINESS" SALE.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.000
BUT I THINK AMY UNDERSTANDS

27:27.000 --> 27:28.400
THAT THAT'S
WHAT MARRIAGE IS ABOUT.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.233
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT ONLY
GETTING A HUSBAND;

27:30.233 --> 27:33.400
SHE'S GETTING
AN ENTIRE MENTAL HOSPITAL.

27:36.433 --> 27:37.900
MY WIFE, DEB,
LIKES THAT, RIGHT?

27:37.900 --> 27:38.967
THAT'S MY WIFE OVER THERE,

27:38.967 --> 27:40.433
THE DRUNK ONE.

27:40.433 --> 27:41.300
YEAH.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.100
I'M JUST PLAYING.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.533
SHE COULDN'T BE DRUNK HERE

27:44.533 --> 27:46.700
UNLESS SHE TOOK OUT A LOAN
FOR A WHISKEY SOUR.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.200
I WANT TO THANK AMY'S FAMILY--
HANK AND PAT--

27:54.200 --> 27:55.933
FOR THROWING
A WONDERFUL PARTY.

27:55.933 --> 27:57.767
THEY REALLY KNOW
HOW TO THROW ONE, YEAH.

27:57.767 --> 27:59.100
YEAH, YOU KNOW--

27:59.100 --> 28:00.900
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED
MY MOM TO BE SPEECHLESS,

28:00.900 --> 28:04.600
YOU SHOULD'VE SHOWN HER
THE BUFFET BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.400
BUT I KID.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.500
I KID THE MACDOUGALLS.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.167
WE GET ALONG GREAT WITH THEM,

28:14.167 --> 28:15.500
ESPECIALLY WITH PETER,

28:15.500 --> 28:20.000
WHO, BY THE WAY, LADIES,
IS STILL SINGLE.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
YEAH.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.933
STILL SINGLE.

28:22.933 --> 28:26.200
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THERE'S
SOMEBODY FOR HIM OUT THERE,

28:26.200 --> 28:30.133
AND SHE'D BETTER BE
REALLY OUT THERE.

28:35.967 --> 28:39.400
YEAH. YEAH.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.567
AND, YOU KNOW,
ONE MORE THING

28:41.567 --> 28:43.067
ABOUT THE EDITING.

28:43.067 --> 28:44.867
I, UH...

28:44.867 --> 28:47.467
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER
ABOUT TODAY

28:47.467 --> 28:49.700
WHAT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER.

28:49.700 --> 28:53.367
YOU KNOW, I GUESS OUR BRAINS
ARE GOOD LIKE THAT.

28:53.367 --> 28:55.133
LIKE, I REMEMBER MY WEDDING DAY

28:55.133 --> 28:57.033
AS THE DAY
THAT I GOT TO KISS

28:57.033 --> 28:59.400
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL
IN THE WORLD.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.800
YEAH.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.967
AND I THINK SHE REMEMBERS IT.

29:02.967 --> 29:04.733
AT LEAST, I HOPE SHE DOES.

29:04.733 --> 29:06.167
IT WAS A GOOD DAY,

29:06.167 --> 29:08.900
THE START OF A LOT
OF GOOD MEMORIES.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.967
WE COMPLETELY BLOTTED OUT
THE PART

29:10.967 --> 29:12.667
WHERE MOM WAS HANGING ON
TO MY PANTS LEG,

29:12.667 --> 29:13.900
YELLING, "DON'T GO!

29:13.900 --> 29:15.767
DON'T GO!"

29:17.100 --> 29:21.367
YEAH, WE DIDN'T SAVE
THOSE PICTURES,

29:21.367 --> 29:24.767
JUST THE GOOD ONES,

29:24.767 --> 29:26.500
JUST THE GOOD ONES.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.233
SO HERE'S
TO MY BROTHER, ROBERT,

29:31.233 --> 29:33.833
AND THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM--

29:33.833 --> 29:36.400
MY NEW SISTER, AMY.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.800
YOU'LL KEEP THE GOOD ONES.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.500
[cheers]

29:42.500 --> 29:45.433
[applause]

30:00.433 --> 30:02.200
- OH!

30:04.033 --> 30:05.700
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT IS NOW TIME

30:05.700 --> 30:09.333
FOR ROBERT AND AMY'S FIRST DANCE
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE

30:09.333 --> 30:10.633
TO A SONG THEY CHOSE

30:10.633 --> 30:12.600
ESPECIALLY
FOR THE OCCASION.

30:16.500 --> 30:22.633
[Elvis Presley's "A Little Less
Conversation" playing]

30:41.467 --> 30:43.167
- [singing]
A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION

30:43.167 --> 30:45.667
A LITTLE MORE ACTION, PLEASE

30:45.667 --> 30:49.700
ALL THIS AGGRAVATION
AIN'T SATISFACTIONING ME

30:49.700 --> 30:51.833
A LITTLE MORE BITE,
A LITTLE LESS BARK

30:51.833 --> 30:53.967
A LITTLE LESS FIGHT
AND A LITTLE MORE SPARK

30:53.967 --> 30:55.400
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH
AND OPEN UP YOUR HEART

30:55.400 --> 30:57.833
AND, BABY, SATISFY ME

30:57.833 --> 31:00.367
SATISFY ME, BABY

31:17.100 --> 31:19.200
BABY, CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC

31:19.200 --> 31:20.933
DRIFTING THROUGH
THE SUMMER BREEZE

31:20.933 --> 31:23.300
IT'S A GROOVY NIGHT,
AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO USE IT

31:23.300 --> 31:25.367
COME ALONG WITH ME
AND PUT YOUR MIND AT EASE

31:25.367 --> 31:26.933
A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION

31:26.933 --> 31:29.433
A LITTLE MORE ACTION, PLEASE

31:29.433 --> 31:33.533
ALL THIS AGGRAVATION
AIN'T SATISFACTIONING ME

31:33.533 --> 31:35.600
A LITTLE MORE BITE,
A LITTLE LESS BARK

31:35.600 --> 31:37.567
A LITTLE LESS FIGHT
AND A LITTLE MORE SPARK

31:37.567 --> 31:39.300
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH
AND OPEN UP YOUR HEART

31:39.300 --> 31:41.467
AND, BABY, SATISFY ME
- SATISFY ME

31:41.467 --> 31:44.167

31:44.167 --> 31:48.233
- COME ON, BABY,
I'M TIRED OF TALKIN'

31:48.233 --> 31:52.367
GRAB YOUR COAT
AND LET'S START WALKIN'

31:52.367 --> 31:54.633
COME ON, COME ON
- COME ON, COME ON
