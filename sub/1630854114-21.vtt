WEBVTT

00:04.430 --> 00:05.680
We could watch
<i>The Godfather.</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:07.220
I heard the first one's
a classic.

00:07.420 --> 00:08.620
You've never seen it?
You're grounded

00:08.820 --> 00:10.490
until we finish the trilogy.

00:10.690 --> 00:12.060
Too much violence.

00:12.260 --> 00:14.290
Find me something
with a meet cute.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.800
It's not about the violence,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.430
it's the story of a man trying
to hold his family together

00:19.630 --> 00:21.800
while the world tries
to tear him apart.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.570
Three hours? I'll just watch
the best parts on YouTube.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.010
That's the worst thing
you've ever said to me.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.880
I will be back soon.
Your mother forgot her robe.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.580
Ah, she lives
with Christina now.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.730
A wet, naked Mom
is no longer our problem.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.880
I will go with you.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.150
Someone needs to console
Dottie when she hears

00:39.350 --> 00:43.090
her son does not care
about her comfort or dignity.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.760
How's she gonna hear that?
Was it not clear?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.660
I will tell her.

00:47.860 --> 00:49.730
I can take the robe
to work tomorrow.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.930
(imitating Marlon Brando):
Come, sit.

00:52.130 --> 00:54.230
<i>Mangia.</i>

00:54.430 --> 00:56.400
When your mother was here,
she had me to take care of her.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.440
Now she has Christina.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.910
Which is worse than being alone.
Mm.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.360
Fine, guys' night it is.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.560
There's got to be something
I need to study.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.780
You are coming with us.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.420
Your grandmothers
will help you study.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.050
You can make us cocktails
while we quiz you.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.720
(imitating Marlon Brando):
Enjoy.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.860
For a man who doesn't spend time
with his family...

01:18.060 --> 01:20.880
is not a man.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.780
If you watched the movie,
you'd get it!

01:26.680 --> 01:30.720
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

01:52.010 --> 01:54.560
Guess what you're holding
right now.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.960
I think I know the answer,
but it seems too easy.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.300
This is our last batch of socks
made in Malaysia.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.170
Next week, MaxDot Manufacturing

02:02.370 --> 02:04.000
is officially open for business.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.440
(cheering, clamoring)

02:05.640 --> 02:07.310
Way to go, Bobby.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.610
To the rich getting richer.

02:08.810 --> 02:09.840
All right, let's talk

02:10.040 --> 02:11.380
about the grand opening party.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.160
Oh, good. A party.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.920
If you got a problem,
say it in English.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.920
Your party is a giant
waste of money.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.720
Massive.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.990
Don't worry about it.

02:23.190 --> 02:24.260
You guys have earned it.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.990
In that case,
I would like to exchange

02:26.190 --> 02:27.730
my fun for cash.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.460
Or stock options.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.960
You know, it's a write-off
if we invite clients

02:32.160 --> 02:33.870
and turn it
into a networking event.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.470
Oh.
You know, tax-free schmoozing.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.670
Well, look at Mama's
little shark.

02:38.870 --> 02:41.010
Chomp, chomp.
(laughs)

02:41.210 --> 02:43.310
It's not a work thing.
I want to take the evening

02:43.510 --> 02:45.480
to celebrate the people
who made this possible.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.650
The reward for a job well done
is another day of employment.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.950
There's no need
to spend extra money on them.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.350
Oh, I am so proud of you.

02:53.550 --> 02:55.350
Hey, your little teacher's pet?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.220
Washes his hair
with bottled water.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.390
This is a long-term investment.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.760
Look at it.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.160
Money well spent.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.530
I would kill
for that hair.

03:04.730 --> 03:06.470
You will need a DJ.

03:06.670 --> 03:09.350
I have been known
to drop a beat or two.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.340
Why did you give me
turntable lessons

03:12.540 --> 03:14.170
for Christmas if you did not
want me to use them?

03:14.370 --> 03:15.770
All right, enough.
I am the boss.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.840
We are celebrating, and you
are all going to have fun.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.310
Now...

03:20.510 --> 03:22.370
who wants to do the balloons?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.150
I live near a Party City.

03:27.350 --> 03:28.390
You're already DJing.

03:28.590 --> 03:29.820
Goodwin,
buy some freakin' balloons.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.470
We're done here.

03:32.910 --> 03:35.140
I got the gig.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.600
You did not put the stapler
back where it belongs.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.940
My mistake.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.040
And the paperclips
should be here.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.580
Where are the Post-its?

03:49.780 --> 03:51.440
This is chaos.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.300
You having a nice
day so far?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.920
Hello, ladies.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.320
Hi.
Hey.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.120
Would either of you
care for a brownie

04:00.320 --> 04:02.320
with just one bite
taken out of it?

04:02.520 --> 04:03.660
No.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.890
It is very good.
The man would have finished it

04:06.090 --> 04:07.930
if his heart hadn't stopped.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.900
(phone buzzing)

04:10.100 --> 04:12.160
(groans)
Dottie's fitness app

04:12.370 --> 04:14.430
says she woke up
four times last night.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.540
So sweet. You are tracking her

04:16.740 --> 04:18.340
like an endangered bear.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.470
She's with her daughter,
right?
Mm-hmm.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.680
Maybe you should
just let them be.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.440
I need to make sure that
Dottie is well taken care of.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.750
It is my duty
as a medical professional.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.780
And a control freak.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.480
I am not a control freak.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.140
I'm just trying to stop the
world from doing things wrong.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.920
We should get you a cape.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.930
Control is love.

04:40.130 --> 04:43.000
That is why Chukwuemeka
enjoys being handcuffed

04:43.200 --> 04:44.860
by Officer Kemi.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.550
Can't wait
till I retire.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.640
Will you relax?

04:52.840 --> 04:55.210
You have bursitis
in your right shoulder.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.240
So?
That is why
you keep the stapler

04:57.440 --> 04:59.140
as close to you as possible.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.110
But when it is here,
to reach it

05:01.310 --> 05:02.820
you must stretch
that muscle.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.180
Thereby providing yourself
with physical therapy

05:05.380 --> 05:06.720
throughout the day.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.120
You're welcome.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.220
You're a crazy person.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.640
And you do not deserve her.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.500
(indistinct chatter)

05:20.700 --> 05:22.130
Say socks.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.900
ALL:
Socks.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.900
Now let's take
a silly one.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.070
I do not do silly.

05:27.270 --> 05:28.540
Let's pretend

05:28.740 --> 05:29.810
Dele got a bad grade

05:30.010 --> 05:31.080
and we are scolding him.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.860
Can we just smile?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.680
CHRISTINA:
Got it.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.780
Yeah, yeah, party people!

05:37.980 --> 05:39.590
When I say Max, you say Dot.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.200
Max.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.460
It is early.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.160
I will try again later.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.090
All of this is because of you.

05:48.290 --> 05:49.830
It was a group effort.

05:50.030 --> 05:51.700
But mostly my husband.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.530
You didn't even look at me
like that on our wedding day.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.670
Back then you only had
one warehouse.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.170
(chuckles)

05:58.370 --> 06:00.060
Hey, what's up,
party peeps?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.510
I brought
some extra muscle relaxers

06:02.710 --> 06:04.580
if anybody wants to get weird.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.610
Did Christina not bring
your orthopedic shoes?

06:07.810 --> 06:10.080
I'm here to dance,
not walk around the mall.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.150
That's the spirit.
Have some fun.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.040
Flare up those bunions.

06:14.870 --> 06:17.260
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.660
Yeah, yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:19.860 --> 06:22.560
please give it up
for the King of Compression,

06:22.760 --> 06:25.030
the Sultan of Socks...
Thanks, Kofo.

06:25.230 --> 06:27.130
...the Jefe of Hosiery...
Okay, we get it.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.940
(airhorn blaring)

06:30.140 --> 06:31.790
Can I talk now?
(airhorn blares)

06:33.960 --> 06:35.970
I just want to thank you all
for coming.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.540
This is a really special day

06:37.740 --> 06:40.500
made possible by a lot
of incredible people.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.350
You are welcome.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.550
We started with the crazy idea

06:45.750 --> 06:48.250
of bringing manufacturing
back to America...

06:48.450 --> 06:50.820
Have you been doing
your morning exercise?

06:51.020 --> 06:52.560
Every day.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.690
Really?

06:53.890 --> 06:55.860
Do you want to change
that answer?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.710
Wow, I sit a lot.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.870
Under one roof,
we can go from a spool of yarn,

07:03.070 --> 07:06.240
all the way
to a customer's veiny leg.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.210
(cheering, whooping)

07:08.410 --> 07:09.810
I told Christina

07:10.010 --> 07:11.840
inactivity can lead
to blood clots.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.850
Honey,
it's very sweet of you

07:15.050 --> 07:16.380
to worry about me,

07:16.580 --> 07:19.370
but you're killing my vibe.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.460
I especially want to thank
the man who helped me

07:22.660 --> 07:24.320
hatch this crazy plan.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.030
The only guy
more sock obsessed than me.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.160
Goodwin, where are you, pal?

07:29.360 --> 07:30.630
Goodwin?

07:30.830 --> 07:33.730
I believe he is
in the next room working.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.430
Oh, what the hell?

07:35.630 --> 07:36.900
I told him you would be upset,

07:37.100 --> 07:38.340
but he would not listen.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.510
Okay, I'll be right back, folks.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.480
Keep the tunes going.
Goodwin,

07:42.680 --> 07:44.180
if you can hear me, he's coming.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.330
(airhorn blaring)

07:50.930 --> 07:52.970
(indistinct chatter)

07:56.240 --> 07:57.560
Ooh, I need another one.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.360
I feel like I'm having
a hot flash.
No.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.090
It's those
gigantic ovens.

08:02.290 --> 08:04.900
I'm sweating
through my Spanx.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.750
Soon they will be Stanx.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.440
Put down the hosiery

08:10.640 --> 08:11.900
and step away
from the ovens.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.510
I told you guys
to have fun tonight.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.390
We're having a blast.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.060
I brought the balloons.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.210
Stop working and start dancing.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.920
What if we dance while it cooks?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.700
Yeah!

08:27.440 --> 08:30.040
So fun to burn
through profits.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.190
Do me a favor,
wear this bracelet

08:35.390 --> 08:37.000
while you shake me up a martini.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.300
GOODWIN: Mr. Wheeler, if you
insist on wasting money,

08:40.500 --> 08:42.230
then you should hear
our proposals.

08:42.430 --> 08:43.970
Are you having
a meeting without me?

08:44.170 --> 08:45.100
Yes.
No.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.940
Hold on,
if we're gonna talk shop,

08:47.140 --> 08:48.470
I need to get something
in my stomach.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.580
Try these overcooked taquitos.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.180
Don't listen to them,
just keep drinkin'.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.310
Oh, I want to work here.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.180
GOODWIN:
MaxDot has

08:57.380 --> 08:59.480
many older,
high-paid employees

08:59.690 --> 09:01.920
that we could replace
with younger, cheaper workers.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.390
You don't mean me,
right?

09:03.590 --> 09:05.770
This isn't gray,
these are highlights!

09:07.040 --> 09:08.160
The hell with this.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.030
Kemi, come on,
let's go dance.

09:10.230 --> 09:11.800
Oh, Bob. You are not ready

09:12.000 --> 09:13.470
for this jelly.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.470
WATI:
Dottie.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.840
Your son needs
to listen to reason.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.070
Enough. Bobby
got us this far.

09:20.270 --> 09:22.440
If he doesn't want to put
profit over people,

09:22.640 --> 09:24.480
then I trust his judgment.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.010
Wow. Thank you, Mom.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.310
Don't mention it.
Now who wants to cut a rug

09:28.510 --> 09:30.080
with a 60-year-old?

09:30.280 --> 09:31.720
60?
I supported your thing.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.450
Okay.

09:33.650 --> 09:34.890
Christina?
Hey.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.020
Has your mother been taking
her medications on time?

09:37.220 --> 09:38.760
What? Yeah, of course.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.260
Are you cooking healthy meals?

09:40.460 --> 09:42.490
Every morning we have
hers and hers

09:42.700 --> 09:44.330
green juices.

09:44.530 --> 09:46.730
And she calls me a dirty hippie.

09:46.930 --> 09:49.330
Is she going to all
of her doctor's appointments?

09:49.530 --> 09:50.570
No, Abishola.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.370
Because I'm trying to kill her.

09:52.570 --> 09:53.640
I knew it!

09:53.840 --> 09:55.810
I have everything handled.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.480
Do you?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.980
It must be hard to have
all the answers

10:00.180 --> 10:02.380
when everyone around you
is so dumb.

10:02.580 --> 10:03.580
It is.

10:03.780 --> 10:06.080
I have never wanted

10:06.280 --> 10:08.350
to throw aggression
at a fellow <i>chica,</i>

10:08.550 --> 10:11.020
but you better back off!

10:11.220 --> 10:14.290
We will revisit this
conversation when you are sober.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.460
(scoffs)
I have had

10:16.660 --> 10:18.700
one Cosmo, and you know what?
You're the one

10:18.900 --> 10:20.530
who's drunk
on your own arrogance!

10:20.730 --> 10:22.270
Tunde, do something.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.100
Our niece is losing a fight.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.240
Okay. Dele?

10:26.440 --> 10:27.410
Do something!

10:27.610 --> 10:30.130
Your mother is losing a fight.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.150
(airhorn blaring)
DOTTIE: All right!

10:33.350 --> 10:35.810
All the single ladies
on the dance floor!

10:36.010 --> 10:37.720
Come on, Mom, we're going home.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.250
Whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

10:39.450 --> 10:41.220
Your wife thinks
I'm incapable

10:41.420 --> 10:42.890
of taking care
of our mother.

10:43.090 --> 10:44.560
I'm sure that's
not what she meant.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.290
That is exactly what I meant.

10:46.490 --> 10:47.730
Bobby, will you listen to that?

10:47.930 --> 10:50.300
They're fighting over me.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.530
You're missing out.

10:51.730 --> 10:52.900
The-the party's just
getting started.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.220
(airhorn blaring)
Blow it again, I dare you.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.280
I'm sorry I ruined
your party.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.120
I think it was ruined by
the active sock manufacturing.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.150
Still,
I embarrassed myself

11:12.350 --> 11:14.540
fighting with your sister
in public.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.510
Maybe you're apologizing
to the wrong person.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.260
You are right.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.100
I should ask for your mother's
forgiveness.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.060
I let her go home
with a deranged woman.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.570
You know, it might
be time to relax

11:28.770 --> 11:31.720
and trust Christina
a little bit.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.710
So you are on her side?

11:34.910 --> 11:37.110
If you want to look
at it that way, then...

11:37.310 --> 11:39.330
yeah, I am.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.100
You do not get
any more cake.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.080
Let me ask you something.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.580
Did Mom seem healthy?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.020
I suppose.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.390
Did she seem happy?
For now.

11:50.590 --> 11:52.790
And on the drive home, wasn't
it nice to not to have her

11:52.990 --> 11:54.530
in the back seat
going, "Slow down,

11:54.730 --> 11:56.330
Mario Andretti!"

11:56.530 --> 11:58.500
It was.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.930
This is working.

12:00.130 --> 12:01.630
All you got to do
is not pick at it.

12:01.830 --> 12:04.870
But I am so good at picking.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.760
You're not good,
sweetie.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.690
You're the best.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.760
Hey!

12:15.960 --> 12:18.120
I ran a factory
for 38 years.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.720
I never gave them breaks,

12:19.920 --> 12:21.690
let alone a party.

12:21.890 --> 12:23.920
Did the unions have
a problem with that?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.460
Unions?

12:25.660 --> 12:27.080
(laughs)

12:28.040 --> 12:29.430
Amazing.

12:29.630 --> 12:32.280
A magical land
without labor laws.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.530
So much waste.
(groans)

12:35.730 --> 12:37.500
What are we gonna do
with all this extra wine?

12:37.700 --> 12:39.770
I guess we're just gonna
have to throw it away.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.610
Oh, but then I'm part

12:41.810 --> 12:43.210
of the problem.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.540
Just take it.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.810
Thanks, boss.

12:48.010 --> 12:50.150
Hopefully Mr. Wheeler got

12:50.350 --> 12:51.780
the celebration
out of his system

12:51.980 --> 12:53.420
and we can go back to work.

12:53.620 --> 12:55.390
He might want
to throw more money away.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.390
Maybe build a wheelchair ramp.

12:57.590 --> 12:58.920
Idiot.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.830
I would not call him
an idiot.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.430
Did I use the wrong word?

13:02.630 --> 13:05.610
Idiot means Mr. Wheeler
is devoid of all intelligence.

13:06.610 --> 13:07.830
Okay.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.200
I said the right word.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.370
You should show
some respect.

13:11.570 --> 13:12.640
Why?

13:12.840 --> 13:15.140
He is running this company
into the ground.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.280
If not for him,
we would not be here.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.350
MaxDot was struggling,
Mr. Wheeler took over,

13:20.550 --> 13:22.010
and now
we have expanded.

13:22.210 --> 13:23.750
Big whoop.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.120
If I was here,

13:25.320 --> 13:26.850
he would have expanded
ten years ago.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.390
Bob Wheeler is a good man.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.060
He believes in his employees
and treats them well.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.090
On my birthday, he gave me

13:33.290 --> 13:35.290
an edible arrangement.

13:35.490 --> 13:37.500
And you accepted it?
Of course I did.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.460
My workers never receive treats.

13:39.660 --> 13:40.970
They work.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.840
As they should.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.900
But you ate yours up.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.970
Like a hungry puppy.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.140
I did.

13:49.340 --> 13:50.580
You have gone soft.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.080
I have.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.950
There's cookies
in the break room.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.150
Goodwin,
they've got oatmeal raisin.

13:56.350 --> 13:58.300
Get away from me!

14:00.070 --> 14:01.590
<i>(knocking)</i>

14:01.790 --> 14:03.020
Come in.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.660
You busy?

14:04.860 --> 14:07.160
Check it out, I'm buying
some MaxDot billboards

14:07.360 --> 14:09.330
in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

14:09.530 --> 14:10.560
That's Fruit of the Loom HQ.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.200
You trying to start a turf war?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.370
Damn right.

14:13.570 --> 14:15.870
We're gonna juice those fruits.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.700
Hey.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.110
I meant to give this
to you at the party,

14:20.310 --> 14:22.540
but things took
kind of a turn.
Yeah.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.640
I thought if anybody was gonna
make a scene, it'd be me.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.160
You know,
I thought the same thing.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.550
Socks.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.740
That's nice. Thank you so much.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.860
These are the first pair
off the line.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.520
Oh, that actually is nice.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.430
Bobby, these are special.
They should go in your office.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.330
All right, I'll tell you the
truth, they're the second pair

14:45.530 --> 14:47.600
off the line, but I still
want you to have them.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
You and Dad taught me
everything I know.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.300
Aw, thanks, sweetie.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.540
But I taught you more, right?

14:54.740 --> 14:56.930
Hey, you want
to grab something to eat?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.840
You're showering me with gifts.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.310
You're trying to feed me.

15:01.510 --> 15:02.980
If I didn't know any better,

15:03.180 --> 15:04.920
I'd say you love your mother.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.650
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you were proud of your son.

15:07.850 --> 15:08.920
I am.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.890
All right.

15:11.090 --> 15:12.670
Enough feelings.
Let's get drunk.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.800
Yellow

15:18.000 --> 15:20.170
makes Mom mellow.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.270
(chuckles)
Red and blue

15:22.470 --> 15:25.040
are vitamins to chew.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.210
(knocking)

15:27.410 --> 15:30.930
Tan is for bone... density.

15:35.030 --> 15:36.150
Hello, Christina.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.920
Abishola.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.630
May I come in?

15:41.270 --> 15:43.290
Oh, <i>chica.</i>

15:43.490 --> 15:45.670
You were never out.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.260
Dottie is your mother.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.000
You may care for her
as you see fit.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.760
Oh, thank you.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.620
I've prepared a guidebook
to help you manage her needs.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.390
Which you may choose
to use or not.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.270
It is very comprehensive,
you would be silly

16:02.470 --> 16:04.440
not to use it.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.680
Of course I will,
you're a medical professional.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.380
Mm-hmm.
"Humans need food,

16:09.580 --> 16:12.020
water and sleep every day."

16:12.220 --> 16:14.020
Yeah, I'll read the rest later.

16:14.220 --> 16:16.550
(door opens)
(laughter)

16:16.750 --> 16:18.760
Did you see the look
on that cabbie's face

16:18.960 --> 16:21.130
when we ran out
without paying?

16:21.330 --> 16:22.530
BOB:
It was an Uber.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.100
He was wondering
why you were running.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.700
(laughs)

16:25.900 --> 16:27.100
(door closes)

16:27.300 --> 16:29.100
Hey, honey.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.570
Oh.

16:30.770 --> 16:33.910
I think I got you a ride
back to the wrong house.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.040
Are you drunk?

16:35.240 --> 16:37.240
As two skunks.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.340
(both laughing)

16:38.540 --> 16:40.380
And you think
this is funny?

16:40.580 --> 16:42.210
You are recovering
from a stroke,

16:42.410 --> 16:44.680
Mom, you're not out
on spring break.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.720
Take it easy.
We were celebrating.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.190
Yeah.
CHRISTINA: And you.

16:49.390 --> 16:50.490
You should know better.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.360
What if she has
a setback?

16:52.560 --> 16:54.190
Oh, you want
to go back to giving her

16:54.390 --> 16:56.190
sponge baths
and suppositories?

16:56.390 --> 16:58.330
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, honey,

16:58.530 --> 17:00.600
you are overreacting.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.900
Yes, she is.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.570
And it is wonderful.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.070
Aw.

17:06.270 --> 17:08.210
Thank you.

17:08.410 --> 17:10.610
You could've killed her, Bob.
Go home!

17:10.810 --> 17:13.950
And you, take two yellows
and you go to bed!

17:14.150 --> 17:15.480
I'm not tired!

17:15.680 --> 17:18.180
I didn't ask!

17:18.380 --> 17:20.390
Come with me, drunk skunk.

17:20.590 --> 17:22.390
You're the prettiest
Uber driver.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.670
Five stars.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.630
Knock, knock.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.870
Oh!
I brought pastrami.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.670
Soaking through the bag.

17:38.870 --> 17:40.310
That's the good stuff.

17:40.510 --> 17:43.410
(chuckles)
Oh, ho, ho.

17:43.610 --> 17:44.780
All right.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.740
I'm sure Abishola

17:46.940 --> 17:48.350
wouldn't want us
having this crap.

17:48.550 --> 17:51.050
Whatever. I've been pouring
Christina's green juices

17:51.250 --> 17:52.780
down the drain every morning.

17:52.980 --> 17:56.250
Well, somewhere in that sewer is
a family of very healthy rats.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.540
(both laugh)

18:02.580 --> 18:04.410
Mmm.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.170
So factory's shaping up, huh?

18:08.370 --> 18:09.680
Sure is.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.640
You got to get your staff hired

18:15.840 --> 18:17.440
and ready to go before opening.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.440
Yep.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.080
And they've got
to be trained well.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.080
Obviously.
And do background checks.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.080
It's all fun and games
until you catch somebody

18:26.280 --> 18:28.750
putting a sock oven
in their pickup.

18:28.950 --> 18:31.110
Yeah, I've got it, Ma.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.700
I'll open it for you.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.120
Thank you.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.960
(sighs)

18:50.860 --> 18:53.380
Mmm.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.630
(grunting):
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

18:56.630 --> 18:58.670
(sighs):
Mmm...

18:59.900 --> 19:02.090
You gonna swallow that
anytime soon?

19:02.290 --> 19:04.970
I like to savor it.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.010
(hacking)

19:11.080 --> 19:12.960
Sorry, Mommy's
a little phlegmy today.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.180
(clears throat)
Must be the dairy.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.800
You know, we don't have
to eat together all the time.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.640
You're absolutely right.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.340
Maybe we can have lunch
together once a week.

19:23.540 --> 19:25.240
Or once a month.
It's a deal.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.400
Love you.
You, too.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.920
Mmm.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.600
(sighs happily)

19:45.010 --> 19:48.070
