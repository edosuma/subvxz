00:14.973 --> 00:17.381
God bless everybody.

00:23.023 --> 00:27.566
Apples! Help an old lady. Buy an apple.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.861
Bless you, mister.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.777
A nickel. Thank you, Mr Rockefeller!

00:36.912 --> 00:38.951
You lousy cheapskate.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.654
Apples! Apples!

00:41.792 --> 00:43.286
Tallulah!

00:43.418 --> 00:45.956
Tallulah, good luck tonight!

00:46.713 --> 00:49.584
Apples! Apples, madam?

00:50.259 --> 00:52.714
Buy an apple? An apple, madam?

00:53.345 --> 00:56.132
Apples? Apples?

00:56.265 --> 00:57.842
Apples?

00:57.975 --> 01:01.059
Apples... Apples...

01:01.478 --> 01:04.563
Apples... Apples...

01:04.982 --> 01:08.066
Apples... Apples...

01:08.443 --> 01:11.812
Apples... Apples...

01:14.032 --> 01:16.784
- Where'd you pick hнm up?
- He's the new fella.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.995
- Working the subway, huh?
- He didn't pay you yet, did he?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.245
I gave you five bucks last month.

01:22.374 --> 01:26.454
Five bucks every month
if you work Broadway, buster.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.457
Hey, that's seven. Two of that's mine.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.460
Yeah, Soho.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.634
A nice long letter.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.301
- Did it come today?
- Yeah. I'll pass it around.

01:39.433 --> 01:44.261
Now get going over to the Casino.
There's a matinee.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.805
New joke?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.482
(cackles)

01:53.071 --> 01:55.111
(car hoots)

01:58.702 --> 02:01.193
- Hi, Smiley.
- Hi, Annie. Been looking for you.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.663
Dave the Dude wants to see you
at Rudy Martin's.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.998
- # Happy days...
- Annie...

02:07.127 --> 02:10.211
- I ain't paid this month. I'm a little short.
- Sure you are.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.790
Comes Christmas time, what you beg
you put in the Santa Claus box.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.634
- I know. I'm a sucker.
- You are.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.967
- Any mail?
- Yeah. Over at the Casino.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.507
Don't forget the Dude.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.975
- Thanks, Annie.
- Aw, shut up.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.655
# P-ractнcalнty
D- oesn't нnterest me

02:42.788 --> 02:46.536
# Love the lнfe that I lead

02:46.667 --> 02:50.415
# I've got a pocketful of mнracles

02:50.546 --> 02:54.460
# And wнth my pocketful of mнracles

02:54.591 --> 03:01.210
# One lнttle mнracle a day нs all I need

03:01.890 --> 03:05.888
# T-roubles more or less
B- other me, I guess

03:06.019 --> 03:09.519
# When the sun doesn't shнne

03:10.107 --> 03:13.772
# But there's that pocketful of mнracles

03:13.902 --> 03:17.734
# And wнth my pocketful of mнracles

03:17.865 --> 03:20.735
# The world's a brнght and shнny apple

03:20.868 --> 03:26.454
# That's mнne, all mнne

03:30.043 --> 03:32.665
Dude sent word he wants me.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.252
On top of everything else,
this one shows up.

03:35.382 --> 03:40.377
All right. You got 14 fifths of Scotch...
Just sit down, Annie. Five of the bourbon...

03:40.512 --> 03:45.803
You know, Joy Boy, this morning was
the first time I ever been to a funeral.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.303
- Do you believe there's a life after?
- Five of the gin and...

03:49.438 --> 03:52.854
Why are you sittin' there like a dummy?
Why don't you write it down?

03:53.025 --> 03:55.267
If I could write I'd be in the navy.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.146
Where's the Dude?

03:57.279 --> 03:59.735
What is it with you?
You can't wait 12 seconds?

03:59.865 --> 04:03.198
You got an appointment
at the beauty parlour with that mop?

04:03.327 --> 04:06.660
Here, give me that. I'll write, you count.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.537
- If I could count I'd be in the army.
- (both laugh)

04:10.667 --> 04:12.494
Why don't you laugh? It's funny.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.332
If I could laugh I wouldn't have heartburn.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.291
(explosнon)

04:31.104 --> 04:34.355
Wanna know why Rudy Martin
was found in the river? There it is.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.768
50 G's worth of I.O. Thems
to the gambling boys. Hello, Annie.

04:37.903 --> 04:42.944
There's a note. "Thanks for everything.
Take care of my baby Queenie."

04:43.075 --> 04:46.823
- What's "baby Queenie"?
- Maybe he left you a horse.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.654
- There's a Queenie running at Hialeah.
- That's right. Hey, Powder!

04:50.791 --> 04:56.034
- Thanks a lot. You did a good job in there.
- For you, Dude, any time, boy.

04:56.547 --> 05:00.461
Annie, is that the biggest apple you got?
I need a triple shot of luck today.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.510
This apple'll make
the birds sing for you again.

05:03.637 --> 05:08.050
I tell you, kid, you get another sucker
like my boss, you can retire altogether.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.935
This could only happen
to a smart guy like you.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.893
There's a man who owns a joint,
gets knocked off owing you $20,000.

05:15.023 --> 05:19.068
And on top of that, you get stuck
for the funeral bill. Go figure that.

05:19.194 --> 05:23.109
Fine thing you did,
giving a poor soul a Christian burial.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.818
Here's luck for you.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.568
Something good's gonna happen
to you now. Something real good.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.827
(Joy Boy) Yeah. You could break a leg.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.625
You give up panhandling,
I'll give up bootlegging,

05:33.750 --> 05:37.878
and you and me will run this speak
together. Could be a gold mine, Annie.

05:38.005 --> 05:42.002
No, I'm not kidding, Annie.
Come on, let's see your gams.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.882
- Oh, boy. Whoopee!
- How about that, huh?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.551
- Hello, suckers!
- You old chiselling moocher.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.929
- Here. Here's a fiver for your apple.
- God bless you, Dude.

05:53.061 --> 05:59.894
Annie, will you tell me, why do I always
believe that your apples bring me luck?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.066
Can you tell me?

06:03.488 --> 06:07.237
Because the little people like you.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.451
- What little people?
- Oh, you can't see 'em.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.534
They live in dreams.

06:17.336 --> 06:21.583
Little people like me, huh? Why?

06:21.715 --> 06:26.543
Because they like children,
beggars and poets.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.594
And that makes me a poet?

06:29.723 --> 06:33.057
You want to believe in something.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.510
Right now it's my apple.

06:35.646 --> 06:40.355
So, the little people jump in it, see?

06:40.484 --> 06:43.935
That's why this apple will bring you luck.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.864
Why, you old con dame. Here's
the only thing you believe in.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.742
- There you go, Annie.
- God bless you, Dude. God bless you.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.158
- And bring you luck straightaway.
- All right.

06:57.292 --> 07:01.160
Hey, Annie! You stay away
from those gin bottles. You hear me?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.834
- I never touch it.
- Yeah, sure.

07:03.966 --> 07:08.046
- Are you Mr Dave the Dude?
- I am. Don't drip on my suit.

07:08.178 --> 07:12.472
What is this? Grand Central? Junior,
close that door. There's liquor in here.

07:12.599 --> 07:17.760
You lookin' for a job in the chorus, kid?
The joint's closed, so try someplace else.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.645
- And lock it!
- I read this in a Maryland paper.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.144
"Rudy Martin, gangland victim,
was buried today."

07:25.279 --> 07:27.604
"Dave the Dude arranged his funeral."

07:27.739 --> 07:31.239
- Maryland? Old Rudy really got around.
- I beg your pardon?

07:31.368 --> 07:36.030
If you got money comin' to you, the Dude
is not pickin' up the tab for Rudy's bills.

07:36.165 --> 07:42.119
- Now be a nice girl. Take a walk. Bye.
- Rudy Martin was my father.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.254
You're Rudy's kid?

07:48.385 --> 07:53.213
- You're Queenie?
- Yeah. Well, that's what Papa called me.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.388
Hey! She ain't a horse!

07:56.602 --> 07:59.686
- Why didn't you show at the funeral?
- I just read about it.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.060
- You ain't pulling a fast one on me?
- Mr Dude, I'm here because of you.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.110
Papa came to see me last month
and he was very worried.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.152
He said "Queenie, if anything happens
to me, here's the lease to my club."

08:11.283 --> 08:15.660
"Give it to Dave the Dude. He's a right guy
and I've got to pay him back."

08:15.787 --> 08:18.278
So here it is. It's all signed and everything.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.120
That's very nice,
but the joint's in hock up to here.

08:21.251 --> 08:25.296
The inventory won't pay for the flowers,
so the lease is worth about a quarter.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.589
Miss Martin, "Papa" owes me $20,000,

08:28.717 --> 08:32.583
and a lot more to some guys
who don't laugh so easy.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.760
- That much?
- That much.

08:40.604 --> 08:44.139
Well, I've got a few dollars in the bank.

08:44.274 --> 08:48.936
What I make at the cafeteria,
I could manage five dollars a week.

08:49.071 --> 08:52.107
- A cafeteria?
- I'm cashier there.

08:52.241 --> 08:56.534
The next one Howard... uh, Mr Porter
opens, I'm gonna be manager.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.950
Then I could give you a little more.

08:59.081 --> 09:03.209
- It's five whole dollars.
- The lucky apple is working already.

09:03.335 --> 09:07.285
- Very big.
- It's the best I can do.

09:09.508 --> 09:14.051
Goodbye, Mr Dude.
Thank you for being Papa's friend.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.219
Yeah. I mean...

09:20.853 --> 09:25.598
That's the first broad I ever seen
who wanted to do something for you.

09:25.732 --> 09:30.229
You know, maybe...

09:31.280 --> 09:33.237
- Miss?
- Hey, Dude! No! Come here!

09:33.365 --> 09:37.944
You know, at $5 a week it'll take you
200 years to pay off your father's debt.

09:38.078 --> 09:42.823
- I don't care if it takes a thousand years.
- Take it easy. I got an idea.

09:42.958 --> 09:47.287
(Joy Boy) For my boss нt was the lucky
apple that brought Queenнe нnto hнs lнfe.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.126
Go fнgure - he's got a thнng
about Annнe's apples.

09:53.677 --> 09:58.304
So the Dude shoots the bankroll and
promotes Queenнe нnto a nнghtclub star.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.566
Much to my surprнse she aнn't too bad.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.732
And you know what?
The club begнns to make money.

10:15.866 --> 10:21.951
And Queenнe begнns to pay off
her papa's debts. Go fнgure that one.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.577
By the second year,
the club нs a sensatнon.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.750
(applause)

10:46.313 --> 10:47.891
We're нn the bнg dough.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.312
Step back. The elevator's coming up.

10:50.442 --> 10:54.903
We're gettнn' so bнg, the opposнtнon
begнns playнn' games wнth us.

11:02.871 --> 11:09.206
The Dude kнsses the old apple,
but I know better.: I kнss the нron doors.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.376
(party horns)

11:12.714 --> 11:14.754
But нt was too good to last.

11:14.883 --> 11:19.510
Suddenly the law pulls the rug out
from under us bootleggers.

11:19.638 --> 11:24.134
- Another dollar?
- Stop squawkin', stop squawkin'.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.518
I only raised you one buck.
Tonight you can afford it.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.980
Liquor's legal.
The whole town's on a binge.

11:31.984 --> 11:35.068
- # Baby, baby, baby
- (chorus) # Baby, baby, baby

11:35.320 --> 11:38.820
- # Baby, baby, baby
- # Baby, baby, baby

11:38.949 --> 11:40.443
- # I love you
- # I love you

11:40.576 --> 11:43.363
# Hope you love me too

11:45.622 --> 11:47.033
Ooh!

11:50.752 --> 11:53.706
All right, you wonderful
bunch of ex-lawbreakers.

11:53.839 --> 11:57.753
This is the last night, the last song,
and the last bottle's on the house!

11:57.885 --> 11:59.213
Hurray!

11:59.344 --> 12:02.096
(# lнvely band musнc)

12:06.351 --> 12:09.021
Does that mean we'll be playin', Dude?

12:09.146 --> 12:14.022
- You are a genius. You are a genius!
- I know. Now tell me what happened.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.938
- The big man is here.
- I told you so, huh?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.359
- And he's waitin' for you.
- Let him wait.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.731
- What man?
- I told you to find Apple Annie.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.440
I spread the word with the BBC -
Beggars' Broadcast...

12:24.578 --> 12:26.617
- Move it!
- Yes, sir.

12:26.747 --> 12:30.875
What are you gonna do? Wait around for
some apple? What's the matter with you?

12:31.001 --> 12:35.046
Listen, Dave. The big man don't wait easy.
He could get very nasty.

12:35.172 --> 12:39.501
- He could put on them dark cheaters.
- I'm not leaving here until I get my apple.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.674
All right. OK.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.923
I'll go look in a few gutters myself.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.815
Herbie!

12:58.403 --> 12:59.317
Shh!

12:59.446 --> 13:01.486
- Did you get it?
- Don't I always?

13:01.615 --> 13:05.066
- Classiest stationery in the house.
- God bless you, Herbie.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.452
A blind man could read that.
"Hotel Marberry."

13:09.039 --> 13:12.788
- Give it to me.
- When are you expecting another letter?

13:12.918 --> 13:15.456
The mail boat comes in tomorrow.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.455
You know, I could get fired
for stealing your letters.

13:20.425 --> 13:25.171
Herbie, you mustn't get fired.
Please don't get fired.

13:26.598 --> 13:30.133
Who keeps writing you
from Spain, anyway?

13:30.269 --> 13:32.427
None of your business.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.685
A heavy lover, eh, Annie?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.104
Yeah. King Alfonso.

13:37.234 --> 13:40.817
But keep it quiet.
The queen gets very jealous.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.985
(both guffaw)

13:47.828 --> 13:49.322
(knockнng)

13:55.377 --> 13:56.919
Well!

13:57.045 --> 14:01.707
It's been two years I've been waiting
for one like that. Come here, you.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.881
Oh, Queenie.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.087
(both) Mmm...

14:06.221 --> 14:08.795
- (muffled) Dude...
- Mmm? What?

14:08.932 --> 14:11.257
The doorknob's killing me.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.810
The doorknob, huh?

14:17.316 --> 14:19.889
You gorgeous stack of cupcakes.
Come here.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.944
- Now, Dude...
- Come on now, Queenie. You started this.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.313
I was trying to thank you for everything.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.447
That's the way to kill a man,
not thank him. Come here.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.698
- What's this? A party?
- It's the Fourth of July.

14:32.831 --> 14:36.330
- In December?
- It's freedom day for both of us.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.911
- You're through selling liquor.
- Now it's legal, it's no fun.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.920
- I sold the club today.
- You did?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.919
Did you bring 'em? Papa's IOUs?

14:46.428 --> 14:48.468
I brought 'em.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.507
There you are.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.312
The last of Papa's debts.

14:55.437 --> 14:59.435
Now we put them in the Easter fire
and we burn the past.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.892
- Now you can make it Christmas, Dude.
- Happy New Year. How?

15:04.029 --> 15:06.698
By saying you meant it
when you asked me to marry you.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.239
Honey, I'll marry you.
I'll fight Dempsey, kiss a cop, anything.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.611
Let's get started. Two years is a long wait.

15:12.746 --> 15:17.408
Saturday, darling.
10am Saturday we get married. It's all set.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.413
You're kidding. Really married? Us?

15:20.546 --> 15:25.338
The real us. No more Dude and
no more Queenie. To David and Elizabeth.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.595
Mr and Mrs Conway of Silver Springs,
Maryland, and their flock of children.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.761
- Maryland?
- Yeah.

15:31.890 --> 15:35.390
You know the house I was born in?
I bought it for us a year ago.

15:35.519 --> 15:39.018
- You keep a secret real good.
- Honey, I want to be married there,

15:39.147 --> 15:42.148
in Mama's wedding dress
by the preacher who married them.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.601
Maybe I should go out and get my violin.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.812
(hums "Here Comes the Brнde")

15:46.947 --> 15:52.902
It's sappy, I know. But let me be sappy.
I'm sick of being Queenie Martin.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.409
Reverend Morgan's still down there.

15:55.539 --> 15:59.667
He's 81 years old and he's still
conducting Sunday services.

15:59.793 --> 16:04.206
Dude, when I located him on the phone,
he cried. Can you imagine?

16:04.339 --> 16:07.922
I cried too. It was the wettest
long-distance call...

16:08.051 --> 16:10.839
Are you crying? I've never seen you cry.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.257
When I'm happy -
when I'm really happy - I'm a Niagara.

16:18.020 --> 16:22.100
OK, Elizabeth. To us.

16:22.232 --> 16:29.480
To the wedding in your mother's wedding
dress... by the 81-year-old preacher.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.695
- Oh, Dude, Niagara's coming!
- Watch it. This stuff burns holes, baby.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.496
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.333
Oh, Queenie...

16:48.217 --> 16:50.043
Dude, Annie's here. Let's go.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.632
- Annie?
- I'll be right out!

16:52.763 --> 16:55.799
What do you need an apple for?
What more luck do we need?

16:55.933 --> 16:59.052
You just gave me a wedding present -
the place in Maryland.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.685
I'm gonna give you one.
An all-year house on a silver platter.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.566
- The whole city of New York.
- I don't want New York.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.819
I want a little town in Maryland
where I can play the wife-and-mother bit.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.031
You can shake this.
You didn't want it in the first place.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.780
- But I'm a man who needs a little action.
- Action?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.738
- Prohibition's over.
- (knockнng)

17:17.871 --> 17:20.576
Hey, Dude, the man is waitin'.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.749
- All right, all right.
- What man? Who are you seeing tonight?

17:24.877 --> 17:29.836
I'm making a meet with our future,
sweetheart. Mr Big himself.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.921
- Not Darcey?
- You're right. Darcey.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.509
Dude, no. You're not going to Chicago?

17:35.639 --> 17:39.850
No. The mountain is coming to the Dude.
I'm not going to Chicago.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.096
Darcey in New York?
The police said they'd never let him in.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.982
They didn't let him in. I did.

17:46.108 --> 17:50.686
Please, not Darcey. He's an animal.
He's a murderer. He's Public Enemy No.1.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.237
- It's all headlines.
- Dude, will you move it? Let's go.

17:54.366 --> 17:58.494
Your car's outside. We can be in Maryland
by morning. We can make it legal.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.538
If you love me,
don't depend on some witch's apples.

18:01.665 --> 18:06.374
- Let's get away. We'll be real people.
- Simmer down, sweetheart. Come on.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.457
We go out into the sticks,
what kind of work am I gonna do?

18:09.590 --> 18:12.341
You're young.
You can make a name, money...

18:12.467 --> 18:17.924
What's money? I started at the bottom in
this town and I'm going right up to the top.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.260
I can outsmart those monkeys.
I've been doing it all my life.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.931
Ever since I escaped from that orphanage.

18:24.062 --> 18:28.605
And why? Because I'm good
and because I'm lucky.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.818
I'm gonna be somebody,
and you're gonna be somebody with me.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.615
- (knockнng)
- I'm coming.

18:35.907 --> 18:39.490
Dude, if you shack up with Darcey
you can forget the wedding.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.659
Isn't she gorgeous?

18:43.415 --> 18:46.202
- Heads.
- Oh...!

18:46.335 --> 18:50.035
- What's grabbin' her?
- It's nothing. She just wants a lot of kids.

18:50.172 --> 18:53.291
Kids? Boy, they're mean
when they get on that kick.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.089
Annie, where you been?
Playing Chase Me Charlie?

18:57.221 --> 19:00.091
And where were you Saturday?
I couldn't beat a race.

19:00.223 --> 19:04.138
God bless you, Dude.
I wasn't feelin' so hot Saturday.

19:04.269 --> 19:07.306
- Ginned up again?
- No, Dude. Honest, I'm off the stuff.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.977
About time. Dr Michel says
your kidneys are shot.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.892
Aw, pooh. My kidneys are
as good as new - better.

19:14.029 --> 19:17.647
You think we could postpone
this discussion of Annie's kidneys?

19:17.783 --> 19:19.822
Lots of luck, Dude.

19:23.622 --> 19:26.706
Save a lot of trouble
if you bought the whole basket at once.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.416
I gotta buy these apples
one at a time just before I need 'em.

19:30.546 --> 19:33.215
We were both bums
until we found that out.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.839
Let's go. Pick-up point, the warehouse.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.927
God bless Dave the Dude.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.092
God bless all my friends.

19:53.944 --> 19:56.102
(horn)

19:56.238 --> 19:58.147
That's the boss.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.405
- Dude's here. Set?
- Set.

20:33.942 --> 20:37.192
- He's got his dark cheaters on, boss.
- Uh-oh.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.824
You're late.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.172
Late for what?

21:01.762 --> 21:06.009
Late for what? For 48 hours I've been
knocking around in this cage

21:06.141 --> 21:07.766
all the way from Chicago.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.431
I'm seasick.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.433
Don't any of you guys ever inhale?

21:13.565 --> 21:16.768
Like being in solitary, only it moves.

21:16.902 --> 21:20.900
Fine thing, some two-bit operator
sends for me in his upholstered boxcar

21:21.031 --> 21:26.191
and first thing you know, I'm being hauled
all over the country like a side of beef.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.614
- This your layout?
- Yeah. I built it.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.119
See these walls? Bulletproof.

21:35.254 --> 21:39.832
In town it's neutral territory, even when
there's a war on. I call it Little Switzerland.

21:39.967 --> 21:45.044
What do the cops call it? They find me
in this town, you can stop the presses.

21:45.180 --> 21:49.759
There's ten vans just like this hauling
real furniture around. Here you're safe.

21:49.893 --> 21:51.933
That picture's ten years old.

21:52.062 --> 21:55.229
Relax, Darcey. Take it easy. Be my guest.

21:55.357 --> 22:01.561
Your guest? Ever occur to you that I could
also be your prisoner? Ever think of that?

22:02.739 --> 22:05.277
Yeah, I gave it a quick think.

22:05.409 --> 22:09.822
Maybe you'd better give a long think
to a guy by the name of Stiff Arm Sam.

22:09.955 --> 22:12.078
He once thought he could hold me too.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.745
Stiff Arm? The guy
that walks around like this?

22:14.876 --> 22:17.546
Yeah, with the blowtorch in the armpits.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.079
That's right.
That's my idea, the blowtorch.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.255
It must've hurt.

22:24.303 --> 22:28.135
It's against the law to carry firearms
in New York, Darcey. Right, Joy Boy?

22:28.265 --> 22:31.135
That's right. Here in New York
you gotta have a permit.

22:31.268 --> 22:35.811
- Nothin', boss.
- Yeah. It's beginnin' to figure.

22:35.939 --> 22:39.771
They tell me you've been operatin'
ten years in this town without a pinch.

22:39.901 --> 22:42.772
Yeah. Luck, Mr Darcey. Pure luck.

22:42.905 --> 22:46.274
I heard about the luck bit.
The thing with the lucky apples.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.536
The wise guys figure
that's two strikes against you.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.742
- Oh?
- Yeah.

22:51.872 --> 22:56.000
They say you gotta buy them lucky apples
off of some little old lady, right?

22:56.126 --> 22:58.249
And if something happens to her...

22:58.378 --> 23:03.206
Could be like Samson
gettin' his first haircut.

23:03.884 --> 23:07.716
Look, Darcey. I got news for you.
You see these apples?

23:07.846 --> 23:10.633
I buy 'em by the crate
at the nearest grocery store.

23:10.766 --> 23:13.850
The wise guys want to believe
these apples bring me luck,

23:13.977 --> 23:16.302
it's two strikes against them.

23:16.438 --> 23:19.356
You know about psychology, huh?

23:19.483 --> 23:22.437
Yeah, I know about... whatever you call it.

23:22.569 --> 23:27.611
It's like your dark glasses. You put those
on, the boys sweat from here to Omaha.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.197
Me? I use apples.

23:35.707 --> 23:38.661
All right. Shall we quit clowning?

23:43.215 --> 23:45.254
(both chuckle)

23:46.593 --> 23:49.879
I like the way this kid operates, yeah.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.220
Smart boy. Smart dresser, too.

23:52.349 --> 23:55.765
- You like that?
- Oh, yeah. It's rich.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.848
- He likes it.
- Mind if I try that on?

23:58.981 --> 24:02.266
No. Why not? Give him a hand, Junior.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.440
Hold it, Junior.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.944
They say you're a smart operator.

24:08.073 --> 24:13.233
Gotta give you credit. You won the first
round. This is round two comin' up now.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.410
- How does it look?
- Great.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.864
Nice colour, huh?

24:18.750 --> 24:20.375
Round two.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.539
I got maybe eight, ten
top candidates for this job.

24:23.672 --> 24:27.919
All smart, tough, hard-headed guys,
and I can take my pick of any one of 'em.

24:28.051 --> 24:33.342
Now suppose you tell me,
in ten words or less, like a telegram,

24:33.473 --> 24:39.393
why should Steve Darcey give
the New York territory to Dave the Dude?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.478
Go ahead, talk.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.691
- That's a good question. Right, Joy Boy?
- Beautiful.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.063
- Got an answer?
- No.

24:46.194 --> 24:47.190
- Got a question?
- Yeah.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.820
Ask it - in ten words, like a telegram.

24:50.949 --> 24:56.192
Why should Dave the Dude
give New York territory to Darcey?

24:56.330 --> 24:59.034
That's eleven, but...

24:59.166 --> 25:01.704
- Are you his mouthpiece?
- Call me his doormat.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.875
Why don't you lay down and act like one?

25:04.004 --> 25:06.460
Darcey, Joy Boy happens to be my friend,

25:06.590 --> 25:10.089
and all my friends are nine feet tall
and make very bad doormats.

25:10.218 --> 25:13.422
You bootleggers, you were nine feet tall.

25:13.555 --> 25:18.632
All big fish in a little pond, but all of
a sudden all the little ponds are dryin' up.

25:18.769 --> 25:22.718
That's where the king comes in.
I'm makin' me a national syndicate.

25:22.856 --> 25:26.723
I'm gonna push some of you
gaspin' sharks back in the water.

25:26.860 --> 25:30.525
But it's gonna be my water.
It'll cover the whole country.

25:30.656 --> 25:33.325
- Deep water.
- Deep, huh?

25:33.450 --> 25:36.285
How deep? Dames? Dope?
That's a little over my head.

25:36.411 --> 25:39.531
Come on. That's bush league.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.535
We're gonna operate
from presidential suites.

25:42.668 --> 25:46.831
We're gonna elect judges,
contribute to charities, finance operas.

25:46.964 --> 25:50.498
We're gonna be in
the big, profitable business

25:50.634 --> 25:54.085
of catering for all human weaknesses.

25:57.599 --> 26:02.510
- What would be my cut?
- Your cut? The New York territory?

26:02.646 --> 26:05.398
Right down the middle.
If you're the right guy.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.563
He's the only guy.

26:07.693 --> 26:14.609
There's one more little detail. We request
the franchise holders to put up $50,000.

26:15.701 --> 26:17.740
In small bills.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.827
As a token of their good faith.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.074
- Who's driving?
- Herman.

26:25.836 --> 26:27.295
- Herman?
- Yeah.

26:27.421 --> 26:31.253
Take Mr Darcey anywhere he wants to go
while he's in town. He's my guest.

26:31.383 --> 26:35.511
- Drop me off at the nearest goods stop.
- OK, boss.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.674
Wait a minute. You're not interested?

26:38.807 --> 26:40.966
No, not right now.

26:41.101 --> 26:45.430
Because, you see, this is one fish
that isn't jumping into anybody's pond

26:45.564 --> 26:51.934
unless I'm paid $100,000 in cash
as a token of your good faith.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.526
You want the syndicate to pay you?

26:54.656 --> 26:57.776
I'm the lucky one, remember?

26:57.910 --> 27:02.239
All right, boys, let's go. We got
some ponds that need watering real bad.

27:02.372 --> 27:07.533
Oh, if you get an itch for any of those
human weaknesses yourself, just holler.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.160
This is my town, Darcey.

27:10.297 --> 27:13.464
Wait a minute. Like I said, I like your style.

27:13.592 --> 27:16.047
But you know the rules
as good as I do, kid.

27:16.178 --> 27:21.421
The king makes an offer, the king
gets turned down, the king loses face.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.895
On a king that coat looks good.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.059
Wear it.

27:27.189 --> 27:29.228
Sheeh!

27:32.778 --> 27:36.906
That guy is gonna play on my side
or he ain't gonna play at all.

27:37.032 --> 27:40.733
If it was me, I'd warm up the blowtorch.

27:43.247 --> 27:45.951
- Any mail?
- Tomorrow.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.165
(recнtes нn Latнn)

28:00.097 --> 28:03.596
Ooh! He uses a blowtorch on people?
What does he do - weld 'em?

28:03.725 --> 28:07.308
King. I don't like that guy.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.477
Be fun to take him apart, huh, Joy Boy?

28:09.606 --> 28:12.393
Be a load of laughs.
All the way up to our funeral.

28:33.964 --> 28:36.003
(sнghs)

29:10.834 --> 29:15.247
(# "Arab Dance" from "The Nutcracker
Suнte" by Tchaнkovsky)

29:27.976 --> 29:29.352
Scat.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.351
Scat. Scat.

29:34.233 --> 29:39.571
Lying all over my poor baby's picture.

29:39.696 --> 29:41.938
(kнss)

29:42.074 --> 29:45.525
As if it were the only place to sleep.

29:57.297 --> 30:01.425
My... darling...

30:03.178 --> 30:05.218
Louise.

30:24.283 --> 30:27.616
I just love Annie's music.

30:29.705 --> 30:33.537
...the reception...

30:36.128 --> 30:38.998
I gave...

30:40.799 --> 30:42.839
for...

30:56.648 --> 31:02.769
for... Lord... Ferncliffe.

31:02.905 --> 31:05.063
(record stнcks)

31:05.199 --> 31:07.524
Here's to Lord Ferncliffe.

31:12.831 --> 31:16.117
(record contнnues playнng normally)

31:18.545 --> 31:25.793
"You will notice I have increased
your allowance this year."

31:27.387 --> 31:35.217
"It breaks my heart that I have not
been able to see you all these years,

31:35.354 --> 31:42.768
but Dr Michel still insists
an ocean voyage could be fatal."

31:42.903 --> 31:44.942
The old crab.

31:53.539 --> 32:00.621
"Your stepfather thought he might
be able to make the trip this year."

32:01.922 --> 32:06.299
You didn't know you had
a stepfather, did you?

32:07.928 --> 32:09.967
Neither did I.

32:13.183 --> 32:19.304
"The young man you wrote about
sounds perfectly divine."

32:19.439 --> 32:28.229
"I hope he loves you
as much as you love him."

32:30.409 --> 32:35.569
And as much as I love you,

32:37.458 --> 32:40.458
my darling.

32:55.309 --> 32:57.978
Herbie, the boat's in. Did you...

32:58.103 --> 33:00.143
Where's your uniform?

33:00.272 --> 33:04.400
You gin-guzzling witch.
On account of you I got the sack.

33:04.526 --> 33:07.610
- Herbie, you can't get fired.
- Can't, eh?

33:07.738 --> 33:11.438
They caught me putting
your lousy letter in my pocket.

33:11.575 --> 33:14.908
- Where is it?
- What am I gonna tell my old lady?

33:15.037 --> 33:19.663
- Where's my letter?
- I don't know. They took it away from me.

33:22.336 --> 33:23.960
Annie.

33:24.338 --> 33:27.707
Annie! You can't go in there! Annie!

33:34.807 --> 33:39.967
You must be in the wrong place, ma'am.
Pedlars aren't allowed.

33:53.617 --> 33:55.775
I beg your pardon.

33:55.911 --> 33:58.402
Oh, my gracious stars.

33:59.039 --> 34:01.874
I have some mail here. A letter?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.993
From Barcelona, Spain?

34:04.127 --> 34:07.247
- A letter?
- It came for me this morning.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.666
Are you stopping here, my good woman?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.628
No, I'm not.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.964
But I do have a letter here. Please.

34:16.098 --> 34:19.929
- What is your name?
- Mrs E Worthington Manville.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.225
Mrs E Worthington Manville?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.603
Wait here.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.607
Mrs E Worthington Manville.

34:49.172 --> 34:53.585
Good afternoon, Mrs Manville.
Is there anything I can do for you?

34:53.719 --> 34:56.672
There's a letter here for me.
I'd like to get it.

34:56.804 --> 35:00.221
A letter? Addressed
to the Hotel Marberry?

35:00.350 --> 35:02.557
Yes. I told that fella all about it.

35:02.686 --> 35:05.142
Are you sure you're not mistaken,
my dear lady?

35:05.272 --> 35:09.981
No, I'm not mistaken. I've been
getting my letters here for years.

35:10.110 --> 35:13.444
Madam, you're not a guest
of the Marberry, are you?

35:13.572 --> 35:19.527
- Of course not. Any fool could see that.
- Please, there's no necessity for shouting.

35:19.661 --> 35:25.747
Then why don't you give me my letter?
Why keep asking stupid questions?

35:25.876 --> 35:29.161
Madam, I'm compelled to ask you
to leave these premises.

35:29.296 --> 35:33.625
- No. Not till I get my letter.
- Shall I call the police, Mr Cole?

35:33.759 --> 35:38.634
Send for the police. I'm no criminal.
I haven't done anything.

35:40.599 --> 35:45.344
Please, mister.
I don't want to make any trouble.

35:45.479 --> 35:48.349
I just want my letter, that's all.

35:48.482 --> 35:51.851
It's from my daughter, see.

35:51.985 --> 35:56.232
It came all the way from Spain. She...

35:56.365 --> 35:58.986
She thinks I'm somebody.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.200
Please?

36:03.580 --> 36:05.158
Lloyd.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.456
Yes, Mr Cole?

36:08.585 --> 36:11.503
Do you recall a letter
addressed to a Mrs Manville?

36:11.630 --> 36:14.963
- Mrs E Worthington Manville.
- E Worthington...

36:15.092 --> 36:17.168
Why, yes. It came this morning.

36:17.302 --> 36:20.754
- You see? I told you.
- Let her have it.

36:20.889 --> 36:23.427
God bless you. God bless you!

36:23.559 --> 36:27.806
- What are you waiting for? Get the letter.
- But I sent it back.

36:27.938 --> 36:32.101
- You sent it back?
- I returned it marked "Party not known".

36:32.234 --> 36:37.821
You can't send it back. She'll find out
that I don't live here. Don't you see?

36:37.948 --> 36:39.442
Shh. Please.

36:39.574 --> 36:43.275
- Has the mail gone out yet?
- Yes. The boy picked it up a twinkle ago.

36:43.412 --> 36:45.618
Look. There he is now.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.028
Boy!

36:47.166 --> 36:49.158
Boy! Yoo-hoo! Stop!

36:49.293 --> 36:52.044
She can't do that in here. Stop her.

36:52.170 --> 36:55.871
Don't put any more letters in that box!

36:56.008 --> 36:57.550
(dog barks)

36:57.676 --> 37:00.760
(manager)
Where do you think you are? Madam!

37:00.887 --> 37:03.758
There it is. I'd know it anywhere.

37:08.228 --> 37:12.558
- Thank you, sir.
- Leave this hotel at once.

37:12.691 --> 37:15.182
Here.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.358
Bless you, sir.

37:49.394 --> 37:51.850
(car horns)

38:04.034 --> 38:06.073
(car horns dнstorted)

38:18.590 --> 38:20.630
(sнlence)

38:22.427 --> 38:24.467
(dнstorted voнces)

38:26.306 --> 38:29.011
My letter. Where's my letter?

38:29.143 --> 38:33.057
- Grab my hand.
- Grab her hand. Here we go. Up.

38:33.188 --> 38:36.059
- I'm all right. Let me go.
- There you are.

38:36.191 --> 38:39.062
(woman) Just as I said:
With Prohibition repealed,

38:39.194 --> 38:44.271
you'll see our streets
full of nasty old drunks like that.

38:47.202 --> 38:49.242
(car horns dнstorted)

38:55.961 --> 39:00.623
Listen, Flyaway. Are you the smartest
agent in town, or you're just a lot of talk?

39:01.967 --> 39:03.461
Your butter I don't need.

39:03.594 --> 39:06.879
You want four bodyguards?
They get 100 a week, I get 100.

39:07.013 --> 39:09.302
- With guns.
- Then I get 200.

39:09.433 --> 39:12.932
- Why you? They got the guns.
- What's guns? I got the permits.

39:13.061 --> 39:18.482
All right. They gotta be from out of town,
dress nice and only shoot in self-defence.

39:18.609 --> 39:20.518
You want four Tom Mixs.

39:20.652 --> 39:24.235
- You don't owe me a favour?
- Do I owe you a movie star?

39:24.364 --> 39:28.029
You were in deep trouble.
I sneaked you out of town in Little Switz.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.445
- What do you want? My wife?
- Which one?

39:32.164 --> 39:34.702
Who do you want protected?

39:34.833 --> 39:38.083
But he can't know nothin' about it.

39:38.212 --> 39:40.667
The boss.

39:40.797 --> 39:44.581
The Dude? I wouldn't do that
for one million dollars!

39:44.718 --> 39:47.719
- Hey, what are you talkin' about?
- The Dude is hot.

39:47.846 --> 39:50.302
I never was here.
Get yourself the marines.

39:50.432 --> 39:52.804
What? Hey, you creep,
where are you goin'?

39:52.935 --> 39:56.019
It was all over town in two minutes.
He insulted a king.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.851
King? What king?

39:58.982 --> 40:02.067
Who remembers faces?
I don't remember...

40:02.194 --> 40:04.021
- Queenie.
- It was open.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.610
- Where's the king of New York?
- Where you been?

40:06.740 --> 40:09.148
The Dude's lookin' for you.
He read Winchell.

40:09.284 --> 40:12.071
Just returning a few items
I won't need any longer.

40:12.204 --> 40:16.118
Two kings of New York, and one needs
a bodyguard? He ain't my client.

40:16.250 --> 40:19.085
- (phone)
- Flyaway, stay here. I gotta talk to you.

40:19.211 --> 40:21.784
Hey, Flyaway, there's a 10G bonus.

40:21.922 --> 40:22.918
Hello.

40:23.048 --> 40:24.957
Junior, what do you want?

40:25.092 --> 40:29.220
I am here with two representatives
of our out-of-town friend, Mr Bigelow.

40:29.346 --> 40:32.382
- Bнgelow? What Bнgelow?
- The Chicago Big... elow.

40:32.516 --> 40:35.433
He wants to see the boss right away
to negotiate a deal.

40:35.561 --> 40:39.179
Holy cow. The deal is still on
and the Dude ain't here.

40:39.314 --> 40:43.442
Look, Junior, you gotta stall 'em,
because I gotta think in my head.

40:43.569 --> 40:46.902
Tell him to hurry up.
Mr B has a touch of mal de mer.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.524
Mal de what?

40:48.657 --> 40:50.484
Oh, you mean seasickness.

40:50.617 --> 40:56.074
Just get the car and come right over.
Wait a minute. He's gonna need an apple.

40:56.206 --> 41:01.117
Stop off at Schubert Alley, get the bag and
her apples. Don't stop to play stickball.

41:02.754 --> 41:06.669
- You. There you are.
- Hey, Dude. The man's on the phone.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.050
The man wants to negotiate a deal!

41:10.178 --> 41:13.678
- Is this true, what I read in Winchell's?
- I suppose you can read.

41:13.807 --> 41:18.220
Why, you two-timing dame. Are you
leaving me for that cafeteria clown?

41:18.354 --> 41:20.013
Yeah. The wedding's Saturday.

41:20.147 --> 41:22.898
You two-timing dame.
You ain't even been one-timed!

41:23.025 --> 41:25.942
You ain't walking out on me
after what I did for you.

41:26.069 --> 41:29.154
I took you from nothing
and made you into something.

41:29.281 --> 41:32.484
So I could become a gangster's
flashy moll? Not me, mister!

41:32.618 --> 41:37.161
You ain't walking out on me. You hear me,
Queenie? I'm Dave the Dude.

41:37.289 --> 41:39.827
I'm not walking. I'm running!

41:42.502 --> 41:45.503
Now you listen to me, Queenie. Watch it!

41:45.631 --> 41:48.204
- You...!
- Watch it, Queenie.

41:48.342 --> 41:52.256
- What are they doing?
- Playing house. What, are you still here?

41:52.387 --> 41:56.255
- The bodyguards. I just thought of four...
- Look, I'm a busy man.

41:56.391 --> 41:59.227
What's the matter with you?
Take a walk! Out!

41:59.353 --> 42:01.392
(smashнng glass)

42:08.779 --> 42:10.818
Flyaway!

42:13.617 --> 42:15.656
No, you're not going out that door.

42:15.786 --> 42:19.321
You owe me one thing, Queenie,
and I'm gonna collect.

42:19.456 --> 42:24.118
You ain't leaving here
with that halo still on your head.

42:24.253 --> 42:26.292
(Queenнe squeals)

42:36.515 --> 42:41.307
This place is like the inside
of a goat's stomach. Hey, Dave? Dave?

42:41.437 --> 42:48.020
Hey, Dave. Look, I don't wanna butt in.
Excuse me for interruptin', Dave, but...

42:48.652 --> 42:51.487
- Dave...
- Man, you have the worst sense of timing.

42:51.613 --> 42:53.985
I hate to interrupt,

42:54.116 --> 42:58.659
- but I just got a message from Junior.
- From Darcey? What did he say?

42:58.787 --> 43:01.492
- Get me a pair of pants.
- Change your own diaper!

43:01.623 --> 43:06.285
I said pants me! And fix yourself up.
Make yourself decent. What'd he say?

43:06.420 --> 43:08.875
In front of her?
She's marrying JP Cafeteria.

43:09.006 --> 43:12.457
I don't care if she marries J Edgar Hoover.
Now what did he say?

43:12.593 --> 43:19.841
Dave, I could hardly believe it, but Darcey
wants to meet with you again, right away.

43:19.975 --> 43:23.676
- Didn't I tell you he'd come around?
- Yeah, that he'd come around.

43:23.812 --> 43:27.940
Look, this is worth millions. Let's not
blow the whole cake to win a little crumb.

43:28.066 --> 43:29.893
Will you stop worrying?

43:30.027 --> 43:35.021
- Others pay him. Why should he pay you?
- I'm Dave the Dude, not one of the others.

43:35.157 --> 43:37.197
- Now go get Annie.
- Yeah, go get Annie.

43:37.326 --> 43:41.193
That's all taken care of.
Junior's bringing her over right now.

43:44.708 --> 43:48.373
- (car hoots)
- Why don't you look where you're going?

43:48.504 --> 43:50.543
(hootнng)

43:50.672 --> 43:52.712
(phone)

43:53.175 --> 43:55.002
Yeah.

43:55.135 --> 43:57.887
- We're on our way.
- You're keepin' Darcey waitin'.

43:58.013 --> 44:00.848
- So let him wait.
- You can't. The man is king.

44:00.974 --> 44:04.260
The king loses face, our heads
go on display in the marketplace.

44:04.395 --> 44:07.479
You've been reading books again.
Where the hell is Annie?

44:07.606 --> 44:09.266
Annie. Annie!

44:09.399 --> 44:11.439
Big shots. Big dopes!

44:11.568 --> 44:15.186
Your life depends on a beggar's apples,
and this superstitious heel...

44:15.322 --> 44:18.525
- Are you still here?
- You'll wind up in the federal pen.

44:18.659 --> 44:21.280
Or swimming with your feet
in cement, like Papa.

44:21.411 --> 44:25.705
- That's why I'm marrying Howard Porter.
- Don't keep the groom waiting.

44:25.832 --> 44:28.205
- Not another minute!
- Get back in there.

44:28.335 --> 44:30.327
- If I could only cry!
- Queenie!

44:32.506 --> 44:37.084
Dude, I can't find Apple Annie anywhere.
She ain't nowhere, I'm telling you.

44:37.219 --> 44:39.176
I hope she croaks!

44:39.304 --> 44:41.760
What do you mean,
you can't find her anywhere?

44:41.890 --> 44:45.473
All you gotta do is ask
any panhandler on Broadway.

44:45.602 --> 44:48.556
- There ain't no panhandlers on Broadway.
- What?

44:48.689 --> 44:50.562
There ain't a beggar on the street.

44:50.732 --> 44:54.433
It's scary. It's like Broadway was naked.
I'm ashamed to look at it.

44:54.570 --> 44:57.689
(Smнley) Hi, Mr Dude, fellas.

44:57.823 --> 45:02.070
Well, the Easter Parade's
a little early this year.

45:02.202 --> 45:06.531
- No panhandlers on Broadway, huh?
- I didn't see 'em before, boss.

45:06.665 --> 45:09.072
- I should drop dead...
- Maybe you should.

45:09.209 --> 45:10.869
It's only an expression.

45:11.003 --> 45:13.920
- Any of you crumbs seen Apple Annie?
- Yeah, I saw her.

45:14.047 --> 45:16.087
One at a time. You.

45:16.216 --> 45:18.256
- It's about Annie.
- What about Annie?

45:18.385 --> 45:20.958
- She's in a pickle.
- Pickled. I can believe that.

45:21.096 --> 45:24.595
Mallethead saw her on the waterfront,
in the water looking.

45:24.725 --> 45:27.298
She was stumblin' along, talkin' to herself.

45:27.436 --> 45:29.808
She was sobbing.
It's good I ran into her.

45:29.938 --> 45:33.557
- So she got a package on.
- It's worse than bein' swacked.

45:33.692 --> 45:36.562
She was swiping stationery
from the Marberry Hotel.

45:36.695 --> 45:41.238
- And writin' letters to her daughter.
- Daughter? That old bag?

45:41.366 --> 45:43.359
(Dude) She's a woman, ain't she?

45:43.494 --> 45:47.159
- What's this about a daughter?
- Annie's got a daughter in Spain.

45:47.289 --> 45:49.827
Raised in a convent since she was a baby.

45:49.958 --> 45:54.834
- She's comin' to visit, bringing a count.
- She's gonna marry a count or somethin'.

45:54.963 --> 45:58.795
- What is this, a rib?
- Annie sends her money every month.

45:58.926 --> 46:01.843
And we've been lettin' her
shake us down cos we knew.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.722
We all are godfathers.
We all got a piece of the kid.

46:04.848 --> 46:08.347
We figure you're a godfather too.
You got the biggest piece.

46:08.477 --> 46:12.724
- Me?
- You give Annie big tips for her apples.

46:12.856 --> 46:17.933
- It's why her apples were lucky for you.
- We got a business appointment to keep.

46:18.070 --> 46:21.024
- You keep it. Just stall 'em.
- How am I gonna stall 'em?

46:21.156 --> 46:24.940
I'll be along as soon as I get my apple.
Now move it. Move it.

46:25.077 --> 46:27.650
- Where is Annie?
- At her flop. I'll show you.

46:27.788 --> 46:31.868
- Come on, Queenie. She may be sick.
- Not me. I got a date with Howard Porter.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.040
Never mind Howard Porter. I need you.

46:34.169 --> 46:37.087
Maybe Annie needs you too,
the way your old lady did.

46:37.214 --> 46:39.253
- Now, just a minute.
- Move it.

46:39.383 --> 46:43.333
No panhandlers on Broadway! Keep
your mind off that dizzy blonde of yours.

46:43.470 --> 46:47.847
I don't think about her
during the daytime, boss.

46:51.520 --> 46:57.724
(drunkenly) Well, if it isn't my dear friend
Dave the Dude and his charming broad.

46:57.859 --> 47:01.691
She's just bagged again. Annie,
you had me worried. Where's the bottle?

47:01.822 --> 47:04.989
So nice of you to come.
The butler will take your things.

47:05.117 --> 47:08.237
Lovely estate you have here,
Lady Chatterley.

47:08.370 --> 47:14.574
It's nothing, really. Just something
I keep for the hunting season.

47:14.710 --> 47:18.957
Everybody's coming down
for the hunting season, don't you know.

47:19.089 --> 47:21.129
The flea hunt, isn't it?

47:25.012 --> 47:27.550
What are you trying to do?
Knock yourself off?

47:27.681 --> 47:30.219
Doc Michel told you
this paint'll poison you.

47:30.350 --> 47:34.479
Dude, look.
The old lady's had her moments.

47:37.733 --> 47:42.442
This on the emmis?
You really got yourself a kid?

47:42.571 --> 47:46.236
Don't sit there slobbering.
Answer me. Is this your kid?

47:46.366 --> 47:49.036
- No.
- Those crumbs, taking me for a sucker.

47:49.161 --> 47:51.616
- (glass smashes)
- Oh!

47:51.747 --> 47:55.495
- My baby!
- All right, Annie. Stand up. It's all right.

47:55.626 --> 47:58.295
Dude knows all about it.
He's a godfather too.

47:58.420 --> 48:01.089
I don't want you
casing the waterfront again.

48:01.214 --> 48:05.343
I was born in a place like this and I don't
wanna come back. That's why I need you.

48:05.469 --> 48:08.885
What's all this malarkey about a kid?

48:14.812 --> 48:21.395
She's coming over with a count.
She's going to marry his son.

48:21.526 --> 48:23.768
Royalty.

48:23.904 --> 48:26.940
They're coming over to meet me.

48:28.033 --> 48:30.072
Me.

48:30.202 --> 48:37.948
Wait till they get a load of Apple Annie.
That'll be a laugh. Eh, Dude?

48:38.085 --> 48:44.253
Wait till they meet
her crummy old lady. Eh, Queenie?

48:44.383 --> 48:47.799
And see this dump.

48:49.221 --> 48:53.349
Annie, you can't do this. Come on now,
you old souse. Get up out of there.

48:53.475 --> 48:56.974
Take it easy. She's an old souse
maybe, but she's full of dreams.

48:57.104 --> 49:02.644
- She's full of gin. Where are the apples?
- Here are your lousy apples.

49:02.776 --> 49:07.355
Old fool, getting herself in a jam like this.

49:11.076 --> 49:12.736
Now come on, let's go.

49:12.869 --> 49:16.155
You're acting like Darcey already.
You can't leave her.

49:16.290 --> 49:19.575
You want me to tuck her in bed?
Sing her a lullaby? Come on.

49:19.710 --> 49:23.542
And her daughter? By the time
she gets here, she'll be in a psycho ward.

49:23.672 --> 49:28.548
She'll sleep it off. She'll be all right in
the morning. I'll send Dr Michel. Come on.

49:37.394 --> 49:42.554
What am I going to do, Queenie?
What am I going to do?

49:43.984 --> 49:49.607
Poor creep. Some Dude must've
gotten in your blood once too.

49:49.740 --> 49:53.025
(Dude) Come on, Queenie!
I'm way past post time.

49:53.160 --> 49:57.572
I got troubles, Annie, but boy, you...
you need a miracle.

49:57.706 --> 50:00.078
What am I going to do?

50:01.209 --> 50:03.451
(Smнley)
What are you gonna do, Mr Dude?

50:03.587 --> 50:06.042
- About what?
- About Miss Annie.

50:06.173 --> 50:11.298
- What do you expect me to do?
- You could get her into the Marberry.

50:11.428 --> 50:15.093
Apple Annie in the Marberry?
You're crazy.

50:15.223 --> 50:18.557
- Just for a week.
- Now listen, Mr Dude.

50:18.685 --> 50:22.765
We already took up a collection, we did.

50:22.898 --> 50:26.018
We all chipped in 65 bucks to get her in.

50:27.152 --> 50:30.521
You did? Well, 65 bucks is a tip
at the Marberry. You're all bats.

50:30.656 --> 50:33.610
- What about your playboy friend?
- Rodney Kent.

50:33.742 --> 50:37.954
- He's got a penthouse at the Marberry.
- You keep out of this. Move it, Junior.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.653
Annie at the Marberry... I said move it!

50:46.797 --> 50:50.380
His luck is gonna turn awful bad.

50:52.177 --> 50:54.633
Apple, be lucky today.

50:54.763 --> 50:59.674
All you little people in there,
you start workin' real hard.

51:00.769 --> 51:04.138
All right. When you get home,
call Doc Michel to see Annie.

51:04.272 --> 51:07.688
She'll be all right.
She's on a bender, that's all.

51:07.818 --> 51:11.685
Hmm? Ain't it a fact?
You've seen her swacked before.

51:11.822 --> 51:16.234
What the hell do I care?
I got what I want: The city of New York.

51:16.368 --> 51:20.496
This great big town and those heels that
pushed me around, it's all mine now,

51:20.622 --> 51:23.623
stretched right out on a silver platter.

51:23.750 --> 51:26.538
Cos Darcey's come around to my way.

51:26.670 --> 51:30.999
What do I need
that old apple souse for anyhow?

51:31.133 --> 51:35.000
You know, they say luck is superstition.

51:35.137 --> 51:38.303
Nah, it ain't superstition at all.
You know what it is?

51:38.432 --> 51:42.726
Luck is an art. An art I got.

51:42.853 --> 51:47.313
So I lose the old lady
and her apples. So what?

51:49.109 --> 51:52.525
Apple Annie at the Marberry Hotel?

51:55.115 --> 51:58.199
What do you expect me to do,
for cryin' out loud?

51:58.327 --> 52:00.366
(clears throat)

52:00.913 --> 52:03.450
Look, will you say something?

52:06.418 --> 52:08.956
Look, will you say somethнng?

52:15.761 --> 52:20.173
OK, Mr Big Shot.
Now keep your date with Darcey.

52:30.233 --> 52:32.273
And no more gin, huh?

52:34.196 --> 52:37.695
Hey, boss. These rich guys
use chequers with horses on 'em.

52:37.824 --> 52:39.651
Put that down!

52:39.785 --> 52:42.157
I oughta have my head shrunk,
doing this.

52:42.287 --> 52:46.201
You at the Marberry! Why didn't you
swipe stationery from the White House?

52:46.333 --> 52:49.619
You could've said
you were Eleanor Roosevelt.

52:55.217 --> 52:58.882
- Whom did you wish to see, sir?
- Is this here Rodney Kent's igloo?

52:59.012 --> 53:04.303
This is Mr Kent's penthouse, yes,
but unfortunately Mr Kent is in Havana.

53:04.434 --> 53:08.847
He is? Well, where'd you get the idea
that I give a hang where he is?

53:08.981 --> 53:12.231
- I just assumed...
- Come over here.

53:12.359 --> 53:15.443
I'm gonna tell you something
that'll make you wet all over.

53:15.571 --> 53:17.148
Really?

53:17.281 --> 53:20.650
I don't care anything about Rodney Kent.

53:20.784 --> 53:22.823
I'm lookin' for Dave the Dude.

53:22.953 --> 53:25.408
- Who is that?
- He's here, ain't he?

53:25.539 --> 53:27.578
Well... yes.

53:28.583 --> 53:35.416
Well, what are you standin' there for,
growin' in the carpet? Take me to him.

53:37.092 --> 53:39.761
Wait here, will you, please?

53:39.886 --> 53:41.926
There is no carpet.

53:45.767 --> 53:49.183
Sir? A gentleman. Rather primitive.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.013
You tryin' to make me crazy?
What's goin' on?

53:54.151 --> 53:56.642
Come here, come here.

53:56.778 --> 53:59.234
- Where you been?
- Where have I been?

53:59.364 --> 54:03.030
- I've had to do everything myself.
- I've been through a meat grinder.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.911
For 24 hours I've been locked up
in Little Switz

54:06.038 --> 54:09.703
listening to that seasick gorilla.
I'm alibiing like crazy.

54:09.833 --> 54:13.119
- What are you alibiing for?
- For you, for not showing up.

54:13.253 --> 54:16.207
So I didn't show up.
How'd you leave the big man, hm?

54:16.340 --> 54:18.961
- Headfirst and landed in the gutter.
- Good.

54:19.093 --> 54:24.004
Says he won't talk to messenger boys.
Says he barbecues them.

54:24.139 --> 54:28.089
- Used the blowtorch, eh?
- Says next time I'll be inside the shirt.

54:28.227 --> 54:32.556
Bluffing, Joy Boy. That's his psychology.
Pay no attention to him.

54:32.689 --> 54:37.482
- What's this?
- Meet the new queen of society.

54:38.112 --> 54:40.947
This is Annie, the Duchess of Apples.

54:41.072 --> 54:43.824
What's your daughter doing in Spain?

54:43.950 --> 54:45.990
Who's her father?

54:50.374 --> 54:53.790
Aw, boss, that ain't a polite question
to ask a dame like Annie.

54:53.919 --> 54:58.747
Wait a minute. You tellin' me Rodney Kent
gave you his apartment for this owl?

54:58.882 --> 55:02.381
Yeah. He's a bigger sucker than I am.
He even threw in the butler.

55:02.511 --> 55:07.505
Not against my will, sir. I love
Cinderella stories. Don't you, sir?

55:07.641 --> 55:09.680
Take a walk, huh?

55:13.021 --> 55:15.892
- Junior, what happened to Queenie?
- I don't know.

55:16.024 --> 55:20.022
Dave, you gotta forget all this.
You gotta meet with Darcey.

55:20.153 --> 55:23.688
That's the deal of a lifetime.
That's our living. What is all this?

55:23.824 --> 55:26.231
I don't know.
And I don't want you to tell me.

55:26.368 --> 55:30.781
But what are you? A boy scout?
Are you a tambourine shaker?

55:30.914 --> 55:36.157
A million do-gooders are standin' in line
to help the hardly-ables like Apple Annie.

55:36.294 --> 55:38.833
Stay in there and pitch, sister.

55:38.964 --> 55:42.333
You see, you're Dave the Dude,
not Little Boy Blue.

55:42.468 --> 55:45.634
What are you talking about?
Little Boy Blue? Come here.

55:45.762 --> 55:49.297
- Ain't she always been lucky for me, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:49.433 --> 55:53.561
If I don't help her out of this jam,
how long d'you think my luck would last?

55:53.687 --> 55:58.313
You wanna help her? Help her. But you
can't palm that crocodile off as society.

55:58.442 --> 56:01.111
She couldn't fool
a pedigree cocker spaniel.

56:01.236 --> 56:05.732
- (Dude) We'd have to clean her up some.
- Some? Look at her.

56:05.866 --> 56:08.571
A ragpicker wouldn't
stick his hook into her.

56:08.702 --> 56:10.944
(door opens)

56:11.079 --> 56:13.368
Well, here they are. The miracle workers.

56:13.499 --> 56:17.247
Here's my maid, manicurist,
hairdresser, chiropodist, masseuse,

56:17.377 --> 56:21.920
and the pниce de rйsнstance, Pierre
of the Saxon Plaza. Pierre the divine.

56:22.049 --> 56:24.207
- Take a bow, toots.
- Madame.

56:24.343 --> 56:26.549
All right, gang. Here's your challenge.

56:26.678 --> 56:30.379
Come on, Annie.
Stand up and meet your makers.

56:30.515 --> 56:34.216
This has got to be a complete overhaul,
kids, from top to bottom.

56:34.353 --> 56:37.556
- Don't forget a new set of kidneys.
- Let's go, Annie.

56:37.689 --> 56:40.145
Come on, wizards. Let's wiz.

56:46.156 --> 56:50.024
My old lady always said you can't make
a pig's ear out of an old sow.

56:50.160 --> 56:53.992
Monsieur, your old lady was not Pierre.

56:54.122 --> 56:55.782
Huh!

56:57.918 --> 57:01.785
- Wait a minute. He can't go in there.
- Oh, that's all right.

57:01.922 --> 57:05.006
Believe me, fellas, it's all right.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.175
(door opens)

57:16.144 --> 57:18.386
(butler hums cheerfully)

57:24.820 --> 57:29.197
- Hey, boss, you payin' for all of this?
- Fun, eh?

57:29.324 --> 57:33.737
Let's see if we can get it back from
the bookies. What's running at Hialeah?

57:33.870 --> 57:37.951
- Here's the morning lineup.
- Thanks. Read 'em off to me.

57:38.083 --> 57:41.167
People! Go figure them.

57:41.295 --> 57:44.545
- Scratch 5, 7 and 12.
- Right.

57:46.049 --> 57:47.709
(snorнng)

57:50.011 --> 57:52.051
(snorнng)

58:03.400 --> 58:07.184
It's important that these apples
are kept here all the time.

58:07.321 --> 58:09.147
- What's your handle?
- Pardon?

58:09.281 --> 58:12.566
- Your name.
- It's Hutchings, sir. Hutchings. With a g.

58:12.701 --> 58:17.244
OK, Hutch. This oughta take care of the
help for a while. Split it up amongst them.

58:17.372 --> 58:20.373
- They know to keep their mouths shut?
- And their ears.

58:20.500 --> 58:24.166
- Told 'em what'd happen if they didn't?
- Yes, sir. (нmнtates machнne gun)

58:24.296 --> 58:27.546
- Don't do that, please.
- (door opens)

58:27.674 --> 58:29.714
(snorнng)

58:42.272 --> 58:45.890
(woman) Oh, my feet.
I never wanna see shoes again.

58:46.026 --> 58:48.065
(mutterнng)

59:08.423 --> 59:10.749
(нmнtates fanfare)

59:10.884 --> 59:16.720
Gentlemen, may I present
Mrs E Worthington Manville.

59:18.225 --> 59:23.385
(# "March" from "The Nutcracker Suнte"
by Tchaнkovsky)

59:51.091 --> 59:54.674
She's like a cockroach
what turned into a butterfly!

59:56.680 --> 59:59.135
Dude,

59:59.266 --> 01:00:01.721
I'll never forget this.

01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:05.435
Never.

01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:07.272
God bless you.

01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:17.111
Well... You... You could've fooled anybody.

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:31.707
Well, you're gonna need a little
walking-around money, so...

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.880
here you go.

01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:40.215
I guess everything's all set now, huh?

01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:44.014
Good luck, Annie.

01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:46.302
Joy Boy, Junior, come on.

01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:53.653
- How do we contact Little Switz?
- They call your apartment every hour.

01:00:53.779 --> 01:00:56.400
- We make the next call.
- Hey!

01:00:56.531 --> 01:01:00.066
- Where do you think you're going?
- I did what you wanted, didn't I?

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:04.282
I postponed my wedding a week because
you asked me to make a lady out of her.

01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:08.542
Don't think you can run off and leave me
holding the bag. No offence, Annie.

01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:11.753
Look, woman, the Dude
has gotta make some bread.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.166
If I can stall my wedding,
he can stall his short cut to Sing Sing.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.087
For Pete's sakes, Queenie,
what else do you want?

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:23.012
I don't want anything. But what about
the husband she's supposed to have?

01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:26.012
- Husband?
- That's a man who marries a woman.

01:01:26.144 --> 01:01:28.552
- Whose husband?
- Annie's!

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:33.730
The Honourable E Worthington
Shmerthington! Who's gonna dig him up?

01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:35.485
Dude?

01:01:35.612 --> 01:01:37.439
Louise...

01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:39.197
my daughter...

01:01:39.324 --> 01:01:42.823
does expect a stepfather.

01:01:42.953 --> 01:01:44.992
Well... go get her one.

01:01:45.122 --> 01:01:49.120
- Can't you do anything yourself?
- Who's she gonna get?

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:53.200
- Shimkey, the blind man? Or Smiley?
- You find her one.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:56.090
You're the one who needs her,
Mr Big, not me.

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:59.301
I got cafeterias. I don't need apples.

01:01:59.428 --> 01:02:03.472
The Dude's whole future depends upon
this deal. Can you get off his back?

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:07.299
His whole future depends on Annie,
and don't you forget it, frog-face.

01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:10.271
- You're a troublemaker.
- You're a selfish schtoonk!

01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:16.482
All right, all right, all right!
I'll find her a... a husband.

01:02:16.612 --> 01:02:21.772
This is beautiful. All right, Joy Boy, go
tell Darcey that the Dude ain't available

01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:26.405
cos he's diggin' up a husband for some
old souse cos he's nuts about her apples.

01:02:26.538 --> 01:02:30.916
Where am I gonna find a husband?

01:02:36.173 --> 01:02:39.589
Where am I gonna find a husband?
In Macy's basement?

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:42.387
They don't sell 'em there, boss.

01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:44.552
(Joy Boy groans)

01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:55.390
Yeah.

01:02:56.985 --> 01:02:58.942
Me?

01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.648
You.

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:03.865
I think he'd be just precious!

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:06.614
Oh, that would be a great idea.

01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:09.580
There's only one problem.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:12.624
I got a wife that's very fussy.

01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:16.749
She don't like for me
to go around marryin' people!

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.415
Now, I know that might sound
very selfish to you,

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.216
but she's very funny that way.

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:28.306
I know his wife. He's right.
She's a selfish buffalo.

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:31.138
- Dude?
- What?

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:33.595
I got an idea.

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.390
What?

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:39.985
I know one real gentleman
I'm sure we can trust.

01:03:40.112 --> 01:03:42.982
We? Oh, now we're all partners!

01:03:43.115 --> 01:03:45.154
You know Judge Blake?

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:50.326
Judge Henry G Blake. That's our man.

01:03:50.956 --> 01:03:52.783
When did you ever trust a judge?

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:58.337
For a proposition like this
we need a guy with class, with dignity,

01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:01.998
a gentleman of the old school, and...

01:04:02.134 --> 01:04:03.544
a thief.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:09.389
Judge Blake, the guy that told you you
could shoot pool was yankin' your ankle.

01:04:10.183 --> 01:04:11.678
Sucker's ready to bite.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:15.974
Up in Providence, where I'm out of,
an amateur like you would lose his pants.

01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:20.934
An excellent argument
for never visiting Providence.

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:25.447
I hate to do this to you, Judge,
but I got a reputation to keep up.

01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:27.614
- And that does it.
- Astonishing!

01:04:27.743 --> 01:04:29.782
Willie Hoppe couldn't do better.

01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:32.070
You pool-hall poltroons.

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:37.710
Once again you lured me into a game with
a master, solely for your own amusement.

01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:43.756
- You're just warmin' up. Another game?
- I came here to slay a sombre afternoon,

01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:47.882
not to be made sport of
by Pecksniffian oafs.

01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:51.097
Aw, go on, Judge. It's only a nickel a ball.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:53.762
What do you say
we double the bet one time?

01:04:53.894 --> 01:04:57.061
Ten cents a ball?
Why, that's a veritable fortune.

01:04:57.189 --> 01:04:59.229
- Afraid, huh, Judge?
- Afraid?

01:04:59.357 --> 01:05:04.316
- I'll make it 50 cents a ball.
- OK. You got yourself a deal.

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:06.486
Attendant, rack 'em up.

01:05:06.615 --> 01:05:08.654
(laughter)

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:13.743
Hey, Judge.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:21.919
If you will excuse me, while you break,
I'll have a word with an associate justice.

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:27.468
Greetings, my intellectual giant. What
brings you down to Kew in lilac-time?

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.883
The Dude wants to see you.

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:33.548
Your master's timing
is most regrettable, my dear Junior.

01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:37.551
- I have a plump pigeon in my sights.
- Huh?

01:05:37.687 --> 01:05:42.065
Within the hour Providence is going to
provide next month's room rent.

01:05:42.568 --> 01:05:48.154
- Come on, Your Honour. It's your shot.
- By your leave, sir. My pigeon is cooing.

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:49.989
A little shaky, huh, Judge?

01:05:50.117 --> 01:05:54.613
My boy, the impatient blade
is about to descend...

01:05:54.746 --> 01:05:56.786
on your red hick's neck.

01:05:59.543 --> 01:06:01.582
- Oho!
- (laughter)

01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:07.422
- Oho!
- (laughter)

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.547
That was the bedroom.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.349
Over here, that's the billiard room.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:16.384
Down here's the guest rooms.

01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:19.934
- Pretty classy layout, huh, Judge?
- Lovely, lovely.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:23.646
The beauty of the Taj Mahal,
the serenity of Melrose Abbey.

01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:26.855
Sir, "If thou wouldst view
fair Melrose aright..."

01:06:26.987 --> 01:06:29.525
"Go visit it by the pale moonlight."

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:35.077
"For the gay beams of lightsome day
Gild, but to flout, the ruins grey."

01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:37.576
- Oh, my!
- To Scott.

01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:40.705
- He'll do.
- Yeah.

01:06:43.337 --> 01:06:46.836
Judge, think you could force yourself
to shack up here for a week?

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:49.005
- Is he for real?
- He comes with the coop.

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:53.595
If this is a deal, you get yourself
a new set of rags and 100 clams.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:58.431
What do you expect from me for all this
opulence? I'm a poor hand at violence.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.763
You're a lock for this gag.
All you gotta do is be a husband.

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:05.811
A husband? Impossible.
I'm twice a widower now,

01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:09.228
thanks to my fleetness of foot
and the grace of distance.

01:07:09.363 --> 01:07:13.146
No, you don't have to marry the dame.
Just be a husband for one week.

01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:15.691
Queenie! Come here a minute, will you?

01:07:15.827 --> 01:07:18.912
Judge, you've heard of
Queenie Martin, haven't you?

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:21.791
My cup runneth over.

01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:24.704
Queenie, meet the judge.

01:07:24.836 --> 01:07:27.374
I told you I'd find you a good husband.

01:07:27.506 --> 01:07:29.545
Madam, this is a great honour,

01:07:29.675 --> 01:07:31.714
a rare experience,

01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:34.548
and a pulsating pleasure.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.423
Oh, Your Honour.

01:07:36.556 --> 01:07:39.557
Yeah. With a new set of clothes
he'll just make it fine.

01:07:39.685 --> 01:07:45.889
Thank you. I'll do my best. But at my age
the libido is most unpredictable.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:48.064
Don't worry about that.

01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:51.941
- What'd you say?
- Your humble servant, madam.

01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:54.528
And your eager spouse.

01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:59.119
- That's the best offer I've had all day.
- No wonder he's drooling.

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:04.667
Listen, you fricasseed Casanova. Not her.
You're gonna marry Apple Annie.

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:07.284
- Apple Annie?
- Apple Annie.

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:11.288
Even as a jest, Dude, that's an insult.

01:08:11.425 --> 01:08:13.464
Junior!

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:19.721
Apple Annie. Preposterous!

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:24.890
A creature of the pavements, a... a...
a frowsy hag, with the breath of a dragon.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:31.600
Sir, despite my larcenous impulses,
I am a gentleman.

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:33.563
Good afternoon.

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:36.104
Good afternoon, Annie.

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.279
Annie?

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:42.368
(Dude) That's Annie.

01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:48.033
Apple Annie?

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:52.084
Annie, the judge was just saying
how pleased he'll be to be your husband.

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.671
Thank you, Judge.

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:58.133
I'm deeply grateful.

01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:05.520
The pleasure, I assure you,

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:08.849
dear kind and charming lady,

01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:11.022
is entirely mine.

01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:21.819
You're all set now, Annie. You got yourself
a husband. Now you'll go to the boat.

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:24.741
Yeah. God bless you, Dude.
God bless you.

01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:27.245
OK.

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.786
Joy Boy, let's go.

01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:32.537
Sure you don't wanna kill a couple
of hours, take some family pictures?

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:37.669
Sir?

01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:39.345
Sir!

01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:41.636
Sir, pardon me.

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:45.893
I will see that everything is done, sir,
notwithstanding my cardiac.

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.059
- What?
- Oh, you can trust me, sir.

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:50.893
I've had commando training.
The Boer War, you know.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:54.476
I shall need at least a score
of your henchmen, very rugged ones.

01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:57.896
- A hollow square will hold them.
- What are you talking about?

01:09:58.031 --> 01:10:01.531
The ship's reporters.
They interview the arriving celebrities.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.744
They will want to know from the count
why he came to America.

01:10:04.872 --> 01:10:07.742
Holy Toledo. I forgot about the reporters.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:11.457
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Why didn't I think of it?

01:10:11.586 --> 01:10:15.501
Come on, Junior. We gotta round up
the boys. What time does the ship get in?

01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:17.672
I hope it sinks.

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:20.135
Take a walk.

01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:28.975
(shнp's hooter)

01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:35.309
(band plays "A Lнfe on the Ocean Wave")

01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:44.615
Has she seen the kid yet?

01:10:46.497 --> 01:10:49.118
- She's still looking.
- She's still looking.

01:10:56.882 --> 01:11:00.251
- How do I look?
- Beautiful. Like a star.

01:11:02.387 --> 01:11:08.924
I can hardly believe it. In a few minutes
I'll have my baby in my arms.

01:11:15.233 --> 01:11:18.318
- Do you see her yet?
- No, not yet.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.354
Dude, stay close to me. I'm so frightened.

01:11:22.491 --> 01:11:25.361
At least the boat's on time.

01:11:25.494 --> 01:11:27.866
- What about reporters?
- I took care of 'em.

01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:32.539
The Dude has woven a chain
of missing links around us.

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:36.452
(band plays
"The Man on the Flyнng Trapeze")

01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:48.974
Hey, look. There's Dave the Dude.

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:52.517
Yeah, with his whole mob.

01:11:55.565 --> 01:12:01.520
Let's stick around. I've been waiting
ten years to pin something on that Dude.

01:12:01.655 --> 01:12:03.695
(shнp's hooter)

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.956
There she is! There she is! Louise!

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:23.424
Louise! Louise, darling!

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.556
Louise! Louise!

01:12:31.685 --> 01:12:33.179
Louise!

01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:36.725
Louise!

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:40.435
Louise! Louise!

01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:52.657
She saw me. She recognised me.

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:53.988
Louise!

01:12:56.584 --> 01:12:59.751
Mama! Mama!

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.707
Mama!

01:13:09.306 --> 01:13:13.386
My baby. My baby.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.558
My Louise.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.524
I can't believe it, after all these years.

01:13:21.651 --> 01:13:24.273
Why, you're a grown woman.

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:30.115
- And so beautiful.
- Oh, Mama, you are too.

01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:32.319
I would've known you anywhere.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:35.657
What are they doin' now, Sal?

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:37.415
Huggin' and kissin'.

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.784
Is she happy?

01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:46.252
- She's crying.
- She's crying.

01:13:48.053 --> 01:13:52.762
I want you to meet Count Alfonso Romero
and his son Carlos Romero.

01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:54.931
This is my mother.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.634
- How do you do?
- Madam.

01:13:59.523 --> 01:14:02.274
How do you do?

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.897
Darling, this is your stepfather,
Judge Manville.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:11.158
Mother's written me
so much about you, Father.

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:18.158
I want you to meet Count Romero
and his son Carlos.

01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:22.159
- How do you do?
- Welcome to America, my dear Count.

01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:25.711
We've looked forward to your visit
with considerable relish.

01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:29.174
This is a glorious moment for everyone.

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:32.173
Oh, how stupid of me.

01:14:32.306 --> 01:14:34.927
- Louise, this is your, um...
- Aunt. Aunt Betty.

01:14:35.058 --> 01:14:37.680
- Aunt Betty.
- And Uncle David.

01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:43.564
- I never knew I had an aunt and uncle.
- Yes, dear. David is your father's brother.

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:48.235
I'm so pleased.
Mother never wrote a word about you.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:53.903
That's because he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

01:14:54.995 --> 01:14:58.578
May I present Count Romero,
and Carlos Romero.

01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:02.456
This is my Aunt Betty and my Uncle David.

01:15:02.586 --> 01:15:06.251
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you. Will you excuse me?

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:10.714
Excuse me. I'm the ship news reporter.

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:13.133
You lookin' for somebody, kid? What is it?

01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:15.801
- You talking to me?
- No, your Aunt Tillie.

01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:19.017
- They made me the ship news reporter.
- No kiddin'?

01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:22.845
- I gotta check the passengers.
- There's no passengers on that boat.

01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:27.976
- What do you call those people?
- Spanish sailors. They all dress like that.

01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:32.109
- Hey, what kind of a gag is this?
- This is no gag. You gotta go to pier four.

01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:36.784
- The Jersey ferry just hit an iceberg.
- Then it got shot up by a submarine.

01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:38.869
- One of ours.
- A catastrophe.

01:15:38.998 --> 01:15:42.200
- Terrible thing.
- Worse than the Lusнtanнa.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:44.373
Take this man to pier four in the Bronx.

01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:48.002
- Pier four ain't in the Bronx.
- It's in the Bronx. It moved.

01:15:49.508 --> 01:15:52.924
- How many is that?
- That's five, and we're runnin' out of cars.

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:56.137
(man) You wait here
while I get Count Romero.

01:15:57.724 --> 01:16:00.013
You will come with me.

01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:02.183
Take a walk.

01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:07.018
I want you to take some
very good pictures of the count.

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:09.476
- Can I help you, mister?
- I doubt it, sir.

01:16:09.611 --> 01:16:12.861
- I am the Spanish consul and...
- I was just looking for you.

01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:15.029
- You were?
- Yes. Immigration.

01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:18.658
We're holding Count Romero
because of some rare Spanish disease.

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:23.034
Rare disease? But there is
no such thing as a Spanish disease.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.206
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, Sergeant?

01:16:25.335 --> 01:16:30.958
It's worse than expected. They say they'll
take the count away in a straitjacket.

01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:34.045
I'm sure the consul here
can straighten things out.

01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:37.048
- Take the consul to the count's cabin.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.016
- This way.
- Don't get too close to the count.

01:16:40.142 --> 01:16:45.018
This is fantastic! I am going to take this
to the secretary of state himself.

01:16:45.147 --> 01:16:47.187
You should, sir.

01:16:50.861 --> 01:16:54.443
Looks like the Dude's
got a new swindle going.

01:16:54.573 --> 01:16:57.942
The Dude's too smart to pull anything
in the open. Let's go.

01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:01.528
Wait a minute. Let's have
a little chat with him anyway.

01:17:01.663 --> 01:17:02.659
OK.

01:17:02.789 --> 01:17:06.372
(Smнley) Gangway. Gangway. Gangway.

01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:10.879
Mr Dude, sir, a couple of coppers
are comin' to put the arm on you.

01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:15.923
Holy cow.

01:17:16.053 --> 01:17:18.722
Junior, start a brannigan.
Sock the Weasel.

01:17:18.847 --> 01:17:22.797
- Sock the Weasel? He's my brother!
- Don't argue. Sock the Weasel.

01:17:22.934 --> 01:17:26.220
- Hey, Weasel. How's Ma?
- Ma's OK. She's all right.

01:17:26.354 --> 01:17:27.766
Good.

01:17:31.902 --> 01:17:34.689
Ma told you not to hit me no more!

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:40.116
Fight!

01:17:40.243 --> 01:17:42.283
(women scream)

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:51.627
- Amscray. A couple of ullbays.
- Folks, I think we'd best be on our way.

01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:53.794
(polнce whнstle)

01:17:57.469 --> 01:17:59.508
Hi, fellas.

01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:04.173
Boy, have I seen New York
in the past four days!

01:18:05.603 --> 01:18:08.354
Boss, Queenie says for you
to eat these sandwiches.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.312
- How's tricks with the social mob?
- It's going so great, I'm scared.

01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:14.898
First thing, breakfast on gold plates.

01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:18.563
Then Queenie herds us into the car
and we go sightseeing all over.

01:18:18.699 --> 01:18:20.738
Did you know New York was an island?

01:18:24.997 --> 01:18:27.239
- What do you want, boss?
- Got a pastrami?

01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:29.782
Yeah. Ma thought I was nuts.

01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:34.627
Hey, Joy Boy. We passed by a zoo,
and what do you think I saw? A cow!

01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.588
Here's your yoghurt.

01:18:37.718 --> 01:18:43.057
- Guess who's buried in Grant's Tomb.
- Will you leave me alone with the tomb?

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:45.637
You're sure the count
ain't talked to nobody?

01:18:45.768 --> 01:18:48.852
Count Romero? He don't get
a chance to talk to himself.

01:18:48.979 --> 01:18:53.937
When the judge runs out of gas about
cowboys and Indians, Queenie sings.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:57.234
- Enough already! Please!
- You ain't heard nothin' yet.

01:18:57.362 --> 01:19:02.320
You should see the way Annie looks at
her daughter - like she was a banana split.

01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:06.579
Hey, boss, those two kids better
get married, or else they're gonna bust.

01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:09.789
See? I told you guys.

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:16.121
Helping that old doll...
it kinda gets me, right here.

01:19:16.256 --> 01:19:18.083
You know what I mean?

01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:22.463
You know, boss, it gets me too.
Only higher.

01:19:23.639 --> 01:19:26.972
I hate to tell you where it gets me.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.389
And I'm gonna tell you.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.564
You're playin' with your darts,
and you're happy with the banana,

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.896
but me, I'm scared.

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:40.984
Three days and nights we're waitin'
by the phone. Darcey ain't called.

01:19:41.114 --> 01:19:43.950
You know what that means?
I can feel the bullets.

01:19:44.076 --> 01:19:46.993
Darcey's gotta knock us off now,
or we're done.

01:19:47.121 --> 01:19:50.074
All right. I don't complain. No.

01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:54.536
You say no bullets. All right.
You say no guns. All right.

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:58.714
No bodyguards. All right.
You say don't lock the doors. All right.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.968
It's crazy, but I've been with you
for ten years. I'll go along for the ride.

01:20:03.095 --> 01:20:08.718
But not this. I'm not gonna sit here,
sweat, feel hot lead, and at the same time

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:12.979
listen to that sugar-coated malarkey about
the beggar woman and her daughter.

01:20:13.104 --> 01:20:15.810
That's all! Finished! Done! Goodbye!

01:20:17.192 --> 01:20:19.231
(phone rнngs)

01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:21.899
That's Darcey.

01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:25.897
I wish I could worry like him,
but I don't know how.

01:20:26.034 --> 01:20:27.279
Talk.

01:20:27.411 --> 01:20:29.533
Aw, for cryin' out loud.

01:20:29.663 --> 01:20:33.957
It's Annie's butler.
That's the bum from the Boer War.

01:20:34.084 --> 01:20:36.041
Now what?

01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:37.711
Yeah?

01:20:37.838 --> 01:20:39.996
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr Dude,

01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:43.251
but the count just asked me
to telephone the Spanish consul.

01:20:43.385 --> 01:20:47.003
- What does he want to talk to him for?
- I don't know why.

01:20:47.139 --> 01:20:50.223
But I did hear him say
that he was tired of sightseeing

01:20:50.351 --> 01:20:52.308
and he wanted to meet some people.

01:20:52.436 --> 01:20:56.683
- Joy Boy, how's your Spanish?
- As good as my French. They both stink.

01:20:58.066 --> 01:21:01.352
Junior, did you learn anything
from Spanish Lena?

01:21:01.486 --> 01:21:04.156
Spanish Lena was a Hungarian.

01:21:04.281 --> 01:21:08.029
Don't nobody know nothin'?
And where's Queenie?

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.493
- Put the sucker on. I'll fade him myself.
- (door buzzer)

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:13.661
It's open.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.124
Hey, you're Darcey's boys.

01:21:18.253 --> 01:21:21.337
Mr Darcey don't never send "boys".

01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:25.676
- Mr Darcey wants to see you.
- We were waiting for his call.

01:21:25.803 --> 01:21:27.842
Why don't you make yourself at home?

01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:29.845
And you were worried!

01:21:29.974 --> 01:21:32.132
Hello? Hello?

01:21:32.267 --> 01:21:36.051
Soy el conde de Romero.
ї Por quй no fue a recнbнrme?

01:21:36.188 --> 01:21:41.893
(Japanese accent) Very sorry.
Nobody home. They all go far away.

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:44.066
They all go... California.

01:21:44.196 --> 01:21:46.947
Lots of sunshнne нn Calнfornнa.

01:21:47.074 --> 01:21:50.822
So thнs Japanese houseboy.
So sorry. Ooh, very sorry.

01:21:50.952 --> 01:21:53.194
No, I'm very sorry, they're not home.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:58.075
Ooh, very sorry. No, I'm very sorry.
They're not home. Nobody home. Just me.

01:21:58.209 --> 01:22:00.037
OK. Bye-bye.

01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:05.833
That's very good, Mr Moto.
Now let's go do some business.

01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:08.589
I'll be with you in a minute.
Where is Little Switz?

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.176
- We'll take you personal.
- Yeah.

01:22:11.306 --> 01:22:15.434
But first I have a little personal business.
I wanna stop off and buy my apple.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:18.846
You ain't stoppin' nowhere.
Mr Darcey's through playin'. Up!

01:22:18.981 --> 01:22:21.020
You, fancy-pants, over there.

01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:23.687
You, Mr Apples, over here. Turn around.

01:22:23.818 --> 01:22:27.603
- Turn around! Up! Up!
- All right, all right.

01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:33.365
- Hey, your hand's bleeding.
- Oh! Argh!

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:36.864
- This way, gentlemen.
- We'll tie 'em, lock 'em in the bathroom.

01:22:36.999 --> 01:22:43.001
When he gets his apple, we'll be back
to pick you up. Now get in there! Move!

01:22:44.381 --> 01:22:49.422
Wait. Lock 'em in the closet, Joy Boy.
They may just wax the bathroom floor.

01:22:52.097 --> 01:22:56.011
- Yes, sir?
- I am Seсor Cortez, the Spanish consul.

01:22:56.143 --> 01:22:58.598
- The Spanish consul?
- Yes.

01:22:58.729 --> 01:23:03.474
- Is Count Romero to be found here?
- Well... I don't believe he's in just now.

01:23:03.608 --> 01:23:06.609
- So if you'd care to leave your card...
- Seсor Cortez?

01:23:07.696 --> 01:23:09.735
Seсor conde.

01:23:09.865 --> 01:23:12.534
Count Romero will receive you.

01:23:14.661 --> 01:23:17.828
It has been very difficult
for me to locate you, Count Romero.

01:23:17.957 --> 01:23:21.657
This is most confusing.
I just had your office on the phone,

01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:24.913
and your Japanese houseboy
assured me you were out of town.

01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:26.327
- Japanese?
- Sн.

01:23:26.464 --> 01:23:29.335
What would I be doing
with a Japanese houseboy?

01:23:29.467 --> 01:23:33.596
- That is what we were wondering.
- Very strange.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:37.846
- May I?
- Sн, sн.

01:23:39.186 --> 01:23:43.314
It is my impression that there's
something peculiar about Mrs Manville.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.397
- Mrs Manville? Peculiar?
- Yes.

01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:49.903
I've telephoned several society editors
and they know nothing about her.

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:53.114
- I would be very cautious if I were you.
- Of what?

01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:58.995
- Father, I resent these insinuations.
- You did not even meet me at the pier.

01:23:59.123 --> 01:24:01.448
Believe me, I was there.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.201
But an official told me
you were having difficulty with your shots.

01:24:05.337 --> 01:24:06.748
Shots? What shots?

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.379
A gentleman from the immigration
service said you could not land

01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:14.507
because you had contracted
a peculiar disease.

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:18.885
And later, the ship's captain told me
you were a guest of this Mrs Manville.

01:24:19.017 --> 01:24:23.264
Seсor, I had no trouble landing.
I am in perfect health.

01:24:23.396 --> 01:24:25.888
You are a most confused man.

01:24:26.024 --> 01:24:30.900
When I try to reach you on the phone I find
your confusion has spread to your staff,

01:24:31.029 --> 01:24:35.656
where a Japanese listens to Spanish
and answers in pidgin English. Caramba!

01:24:35.784 --> 01:24:39.782
Seсor, give the gentleman his hat.

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:47.910
Very well, Count Romero. But in taking
my leave, let me add only this.

01:24:48.046 --> 01:24:51.830
That a bellboy in this very hotel
assured me that this penthouse

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:56.843
is permanently leased by an American
novelist named Rodney Kent.

01:24:56.972 --> 01:25:01.219
Is this the way our diplomats conduct
our affairs? Questioning bellboys?

01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:06.856
Good day, sir. This episode
will raise some eyebrows in Madrid.

01:25:06.981 --> 01:25:09.389
- Rodney Kent!
- It's ridiculous.

01:25:09.526 --> 01:25:13.654
For years Louise has corresponded
with her mother at this very hotel.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.820
- If I may, sir?
- Sн, sн.

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:17.989
Thank you.

01:25:18.118 --> 01:25:20.870
- Rodney Kent does live here.
- What?

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:24.116
In these books, sir. See?

01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:26.289
Pulitzer Prize winner.

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:31.127
The judge - Judge Manville -
writes under that name.

01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:32.667
Ah. Ah!

01:25:32.799 --> 01:25:36.002
- After the fashion of Mr Mark Twain.
- And O Henry, Father.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:40.085
O Henry. Sн, seсor. Yes.

01:25:40.224 --> 01:25:43.972
- I trust this confidence will be respected.
- Of course.

01:25:44.102 --> 01:25:45.727
Thank you.

01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:49.104
Tea is served, sir, on the terrace.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:51.605
Now, what are we gonna do after tea?

01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:55.603
- What does the count like to do most?
- Well, he rides a bicycle a great deal.

01:25:55.739 --> 01:25:57.779
Six-day bicycle races.

01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:00.577
Great. I'll call for tickets.

01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:03.490
Oh, dear Count, I have
such a surprise for you.

01:26:03.622 --> 01:26:08.533
We just decided to go to the six-day
bicycle races at Madison Square Garden.

01:26:08.668 --> 01:26:13.663
- But we'll not be here for six more days.
- Hi, everybody. Just came to say hello.

01:26:13.798 --> 01:26:18.425
And... buy one of your delicious apples.

01:26:18.553 --> 01:26:23.096
Oh, here we are. You see, Count,
it's sort of a family joke.

01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:26.676
I always feel that
these apples bring me luck.

01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:32.435
What a charming idea.
I have the same feeling about onions.

01:26:32.567 --> 01:26:37.194
- What is it, Hutchings?
- A journalist to see you, sir. Second call.

01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:39.362
(Dude) That guy out there is a reporter.

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:43.074
(judge) What provoked the curiosity
in this wretched scribe?

01:26:43.203 --> 01:26:46.987
- He requests a biography of Mrs Manville.
- Absurd.

01:26:47.124 --> 01:26:50.041
Brother David, perhaps you
can handle this inquisitor?

01:26:50.168 --> 01:26:53.538
Don't worry about a thing, Judge.
Everything's taken care of.

01:27:00.345 --> 01:27:03.714
- What's the pitch, Brisbane?
- From the society desk at the Star.

01:27:03.849 --> 01:27:06.601
I wanna do a feature
on Mrs E Worthington Manville.

01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:10.012
- She's not in the Social Register.
- Not in the Social Register?

01:27:10.146 --> 01:27:12.472
Or the phone book,
not even the Yellow Pages.

01:27:12.607 --> 01:27:14.102
Did you look under M's?

01:27:14.234 --> 01:27:18.362
Look, I'm tired.
The Spanish consul called my editor...

01:27:18.488 --> 01:27:21.739
- Say, aren't you Dave the Dude?
- What is he talking about?

01:27:21.867 --> 01:27:24.737
Sure. I seen you around
Queenie Martin's club.

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:28.120
You know, you're wasting your time
with society news.

01:27:28.248 --> 01:27:32.032
You could be a great big reporter,
and we could give you a great big story.

01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:36.083
Yeah, but we better go someplace
where we won't be disturbed.

01:27:36.214 --> 01:27:38.752
- Isn't that right, Uncle David?
- That's right.

01:27:38.884 --> 01:27:42.751
- Do you want to step this way?
- Right this way.

01:27:48.727 --> 01:27:52.476
No more sightseeing. No more buildings.

01:27:52.606 --> 01:27:58.525
Mrs Manville, I have come
to know your daughter that well

01:27:58.653 --> 01:28:01.738
that I love her like a father.

01:28:01.865 --> 01:28:04.700
Thanks... Thank you.

01:28:04.826 --> 01:28:08.694
And so I wish to announce
I will be greatly honoured

01:28:08.831 --> 01:28:13.742
if your daughter will accept
the proposal of my son in marriage.

01:28:13.877 --> 01:28:18.171
Congratulations, Carlos! This is
a great moment, a historic moment.

01:28:18.298 --> 01:28:21.798
The union of our two families.
The Montagues and the Capulets.

01:28:21.927 --> 01:28:25.759
My dear Count,
this calls for a real celebration.

01:28:25.889 --> 01:28:28.178
That is exactly what I was coming to.

01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:33.266
It will give me the greatest pleasure
to announce the engagement officially

01:28:33.396 --> 01:28:38.189
at a reception for a few
of your intimate friends.

01:28:39.778 --> 01:28:42.067
Reception?

01:28:42.197 --> 01:28:45.032
- With people?
- Sн.

01:28:45.158 --> 01:28:46.818
- Father...
- No, no.

01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:51.456
Relax and enjoy yourself, newsboy.
You're living at the Marberry.

01:28:51.582 --> 01:28:54.037
- It was nice meetin' you.
- (muffled crнes)

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.537
Watch your diction, watch your diction.

01:28:58.046 --> 01:28:59.956
Reporter's taken care of, Judge.

01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:04.253
Uncle David, congratulate us.
Carlos and I are engaged.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:07.671
You're a lucky man, Carlos.
Congratulations.

01:29:07.806 --> 01:29:12.634
Brother David, I just told the count we'd
make the announcement at the reception.

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:15.640
Fine. Well, I'll see you folks around.

01:29:19.609 --> 01:29:22.943
Reception? What reception?

01:29:23.071 --> 01:29:26.654
The count wants to meet
some of our friends.

01:29:28.452 --> 01:29:31.121
A modest affair. Nothing elaborate.

01:29:31.247 --> 01:29:34.081
Just the intimate friends
of the parents of the bride.

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:38.371
About... 100 people, did you say, Judge?

01:29:39.087 --> 01:29:41.543
100... friends?

01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:44.425
You're the only one
who can handle it, David.

01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:50.636
- We must tell Aunt Betty at once.
- Aunt Betty will be the first to know.

01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:55.926
Brother Henry, would you come with me?
I think we have to make up a list.

01:29:59.232 --> 01:30:04.357
Mrs Manville, I hope there is
enough time for the preparations.

01:30:06.115 --> 01:30:09.614
Why, you two-bit pool hustler.
Sit down there. Sit down!

01:30:09.743 --> 01:30:13.242
- I told you not to get used to high living.
- It was the count's idea!

01:30:13.372 --> 01:30:16.041
- I oughta belt him.
- Now, now, godfather.

01:30:16.166 --> 01:30:21.374
Do you know what this windbag's
got us into? A reception for 100 people.

01:30:21.505 --> 01:30:23.414
(door opens)

01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:30.638
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm fleeing from Armageddon, sir.

01:30:30.764 --> 01:30:34.892
With my cardiac condition
I just cannot take unhappy endings.

01:30:35.018 --> 01:30:38.932
- So I'm off to join Mr Kent in Havana.
- With two broken legs?

01:30:39.064 --> 01:30:41.769
My legs, sir? Oh, they're quite...

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.355
Oh. Oh!

01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:46.941
Very cleverly put, sir.

01:30:47.072 --> 01:30:50.156
Thank you, sir. Yes. Not at all.

01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:01.082
You!

01:31:03.713 --> 01:31:09.834
- You'll break the poor lady's heart.
- Why didn't you stop it before it started?

01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:12.508
- Oh, there you are.
- So we gotta throw a party.

01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:15.309
So we just herd up
a bunch of freeloaders.

01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:19.348
Society freeloaders. The count
expects 100 of the Four Hundred.

01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:21.519
Annie only knows people from sewers.

01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:25.313
Which reminds me. You got a couple of
sewer rats trussed up in the closet.

01:31:25.443 --> 01:31:27.650
Darcey's mugs. I forgot all about them.

01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:30.021
The Weasel's in Annie's place,
so I'm here.

01:31:30.156 --> 01:31:34.902
Somebody tell me how I got into this pot.
I didn't wanna be dealt in in the first place.

01:31:35.037 --> 01:31:38.121
You, Queenie. You were the one
who suckered me into this.

01:31:38.248 --> 01:31:41.783
As long as I was minding my own
business in my own racket, it was fine.

01:31:41.918 --> 01:31:45.204
But then I had to start to help somebody,
had to be the big man.

01:31:45.338 --> 01:31:47.581
And will you look at me now?

01:31:47.716 --> 01:31:50.041
I got oost into this old dame's life,

01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:54.174
I got a couple of hoods, a couple of
hatchet men, stashed in that closet,

01:31:54.306 --> 01:31:59.182
- a reporter guzzled up in the penthouse...
- You got three reporters in the penthouse.

01:31:59.311 --> 01:32:02.929
- Three?
- Two more showed up so we bagged 'em.

01:32:03.064 --> 01:32:06.434
That's kidnapping. Do you know
what the newspapers'll do to us?

01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:10.518
Does it still kinda get you
a little bit, right here?

01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:14.983
- The butler says there's enough food.
- That's it. I've had it.

01:32:15.118 --> 01:32:18.737
You, Junior, bring those
Darcey orang-utans to me right now.

01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:24.542
I like that butler. Calls me "sir",
bows to me. Makes me feel like a broad.

01:32:25.712 --> 01:32:29.295
You take care of those reporters
till I square the beef with 'em.

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:33.292
And you go tell your friend Annie
to take her business around the corner,

01:32:33.428 --> 01:32:36.133
because I am through, I am finished!

01:32:36.265 --> 01:32:40.048
Oh, boy. And just when you were
starting to act like a human.

01:32:40.185 --> 01:32:43.720
Queenie, you got 30 seconds
before I pick you up and throw you out.

01:32:43.855 --> 01:32:47.022
You know, some people
toss charity balls for homeless cats.

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:49.688
They even build zoos
so wild animals live good.

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:52.108
- You get arrested if you whip a horse.
- 10.

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:54.694
Good people help, Dude. What are we?

01:32:54.825 --> 01:32:57.779
Did we ever build a bridge
or plant a seed?

01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.738
- 20.
- We're nothin'.

01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:02.873
We're all a bunch of grabbers,
looking for the best of it.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.708
- Just once, couldn't we help somebody?
- That's it. You're through, sister.

01:33:07.838 --> 01:33:11.966
Yes, we're gonna help somebody.
We are going to help me.

01:33:12.092 --> 01:33:16.505
I'm gonna make any kind of a deal Darcey
wants. Unless we've blown it already.

01:33:16.638 --> 01:33:22.427
Hallelujah! I'm gonna drink to you.
It's my first in five years.

01:33:22.895 --> 01:33:26.477
Do I infer you're stranding Annie
on the rocky beach of despair?

01:33:26.606 --> 01:33:30.651
I've had just about enough
of your hot air too, Judge. You - out!

01:33:30.777 --> 01:33:33.103
And you - out. Both of you - out.

01:33:33.238 --> 01:33:35.776
That's it. School's out. Everybody out.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.487
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:42.455
Louise! Darling!

01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:44.906
Uncle David just told me the good news.

01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:48.327
- My heartiest congratulations, Carlos.
- Thank you.

01:33:48.461 --> 01:33:53.254
- I hope we're not intruding.
- Not at all. You're a breath of spring.

01:33:53.383 --> 01:33:58.543
We were just taking a walk and Carlos had
the most wonderful, sweetest idea.

01:33:58.681 --> 01:34:02.595
- What is it, Carlos?
- No, no. This is not the time. Or the place.

01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:06.854
Of course it is, Carlos.
He thinks the world of you, Uncle David.

01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.065
- Louise.
- What is it, Carlos?

01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:13.643
Well, sir, I... that is, Louise and I...

01:34:13.779 --> 01:34:14.774
Yes.

01:34:14.905 --> 01:34:18.523
...we would be most pleased if,
when the time comes,

01:34:18.658 --> 01:34:23.700
you will consent to be godfather
to our first child.

01:34:35.967 --> 01:34:38.209
He'd be delighted.

01:34:38.345 --> 01:34:41.132
Uncle David's already
an experienced godfather.

01:34:41.265 --> 01:34:44.219
Oh, Uncle David! I love you so much.

01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:49.227
Thank you, seсor. I am very honoured,
and my family is very honoured.

01:34:49.356 --> 01:34:52.310
- And if it's a boy we'll name him after you.
- No.

01:34:52.442 --> 01:34:55.016
Louise, we cannot take up
any more of their time.

01:34:55.153 --> 01:34:59.281
No. I'm sure you have so much to do,
arranging the reception on short notice.

01:34:59.408 --> 01:35:01.032
Goodbye.

01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:06.286
- About 100 people, you said, Judge?
- Not just people.

01:35:06.415 --> 01:35:12.287
But citizens of style and grace.
And this above all: Daisies who won't tell.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.958
Dude's gang!

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:18.506
Now, there's a bunch of daisies
that wouldn't dare squeal.

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:21.173
With the right clothes
they'd pass off as kings.

01:35:21.305 --> 01:35:23.381
- They would?
- Well, look at Annie.

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.053
The count fell for her. And you and me.

01:35:26.185 --> 01:35:30.597
And Carlos thinks the Dude
is a young Abe Lincoln.

01:35:34.067 --> 01:35:39.607
And the count even swallowed Joy Boy,
and I can do better than that in a pet shop.

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:42.824
If you weren't a broad
I'd kick you right in the stomach.

01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:45.656
And my old chorus girls.

01:35:45.787 --> 01:35:49.832
Why, they'd make the most glamorous
society queens this town's ever seen!

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:53.327
Indeed. Why not?
The world goes round in make-believe.

01:35:53.461 --> 01:35:57.708
Louie the Lug - with a carnation in his
buttonhole, he'll look like Grover Whalen.

01:35:57.841 --> 01:36:00.758
(Queenнe) The Weasel'd make
a great secretary of war.

01:36:00.886 --> 01:36:04.930
The Weasel as secretary of war? No,
he don't rate no more than an alderman.

01:36:05.057 --> 01:36:06.551
Dude!

01:36:06.683 --> 01:36:10.598
Why, the Weasel'd make as good a
secretary of war as anyone you can name.

01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:12.769
No, I think he'd rate an alderman.

01:36:12.898 --> 01:36:15.436
Dude, you're gettin' hooked again.

01:36:15.567 --> 01:36:20.478
You know what? You almost had me
walking out on poor old Apple Annie.

01:36:20.614 --> 01:36:24.991
Queenie, call your broads. Judge, call
Boyle's pool room. You know the number.

01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:28.819
- I'll call...
- Dude... Dude!

01:36:28.956 --> 01:36:31.992
Round everybody up.

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:35.459
They was knotted real tight.
Good thing I was a boy scout.

01:36:35.587 --> 01:36:37.876
Mr Darcey ain't gonna like this.

01:36:38.006 --> 01:36:43.083
You tell Mr Darcey he's got a deal, but on
my terms. He delivers me $100,000 cash.

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:47.004
And no more of you popgun monkeys
showing up or else I ain't gonna like it.

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.344
Would you kindly connect me
with Harry the Horse?

01:36:50.477 --> 01:36:53.229
Honey, forget the house party.
I need you now.

01:36:53.355 --> 01:36:57.483
Cheesecake, roust out the boys
and take 'em to a Turkish bath, will you?

01:36:57.609 --> 01:37:00.147
What do you think, what for?
A bath, you jerk!

01:37:00.278 --> 01:37:03.612
Hey, Joy Boy, get ahold of whatshisname.
Rosy, the suit man.

01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:07.785
That's a good idea. I'll have him
measure you all for straitjackets.

01:37:07.911 --> 01:37:09.950
(all talkнng at once)

01:37:15.585 --> 01:37:24.044
(Louнse) # I gave my love a cherry
without no stone

01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:33.101
# I gave my love a chicken
without no bone

01:37:33.937 --> 01:37:42.727
# I gave my love a ring that had no end

01:37:43.405 --> 01:37:48.399
# I gave my love a baby

01:37:48.535 --> 01:37:54.574
# With no crying

01:37:55.166 --> 01:37:59.912
# I threw Carlos a flower

01:38:00.047 --> 01:38:04.507
# And blushed a smile

01:38:04.635 --> 01:38:09.344
# My love threw me the autumn moon

01:38:09.473 --> 01:38:15.143
# And laughed a mile

01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:19.849
# I gave my love a heart of love

01:38:19.983 --> 01:38:24.729
# Wrapped up in pink and blue

01:38:25.697 --> 01:38:31.735
# I'll give my love a baby

01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:37.825
# Who'll look like you

01:38:38.877 --> 01:38:42.875
- Keep singing. Please.
- No, Carlos. It's your turn.

01:38:43.006 --> 01:38:46.340
- I'm busy.
- The wedding poem. You promised.

01:38:46.468 --> 01:38:49.137
- Keep still.
- You'll have to at the wedding feast.

01:38:49.262 --> 01:38:52.797
Your father told me that every Romero
for 1,000 years has had to do it.

01:38:52.933 --> 01:38:57.061
- All because some silly ancestor wrote it.
- I love it. Please?

01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:59.512
You interrupt people
at the oddest moments.

01:38:59.648 --> 01:39:02.104
Please?

01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:04.559
I hope nobody is listening.

01:39:08.657 --> 01:39:15.194
For her, for whom
I would walk through fire,

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:22.496
the great cathedral's heavenly choir
sings God's angelic music.

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:26.749
Be still, my racing heart -

01:39:26.883 --> 01:39:32.174
she is floating toward me
as a winged melody.

01:39:32.306 --> 01:39:35.093
I burst with a Spanish pride.

01:39:35.225 --> 01:39:38.641
A thousand eyes, all moist and dewy,

01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:42.519
share the lovely vision.

01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:46.184
Behold: My bride.

01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:07.837
- Mother!
- Mrs Manville.

01:40:09.384 --> 01:40:13.334
- I was Ionely for you.
- It is my fault. Please.

01:40:13.472 --> 01:40:19.557
I have a lifetime with Louise, and you
only two days. I will see you later, Mother.

01:40:21.521 --> 01:40:24.392
You do not mind
my calling you "Mother"?

01:40:24.524 --> 01:40:27.193
I'd like that... Son.

01:40:28.612 --> 01:40:31.067
Thank you...

01:40:31.198 --> 01:40:33.237
Mother.

01:40:37.746 --> 01:40:40.616
You do love him, don't you?

01:40:40.749 --> 01:40:44.248
So much it must show, Mama.

01:40:44.377 --> 01:40:46.999
Today, when we were
walking along Broadway,

01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:51.080
a little old flower pedlar -
a deaf and dumb lady - gave me this.

01:40:51.218 --> 01:40:56.841
She insisted I take it,
and she refused to accept a penny for it.

01:40:56.974 --> 01:41:01.801
- Oh, Mama, life is wonderful, isn't it?
- Yes, baby. Yes.

01:41:04.564 --> 01:41:06.806
- Mama?
- Yes?

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:12.988
You don't think anything can...
can happen, do you?

01:41:13.115 --> 01:41:17.611
- Happen?
- I'm foolish, I suppose.

01:41:17.744 --> 01:41:20.200
Maybe it's because I'm wishing so hard.

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:23.616
Mama, have you ever wished
for something so hard...

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.123
Nothing's going to happen.

01:41:27.546 --> 01:41:29.585
Nothing.

01:41:38.432 --> 01:41:40.389
- (нntercom buzzes)
- Yeah?

01:41:40.517 --> 01:41:44.432
- Captaнn Moore to see you, Inspector.
- Send him right in.

01:41:45.063 --> 01:41:48.847
- Anything on the missing reporters?
- Nothing, Inspector. Not a thing.

01:41:48.983 --> 01:41:51.023
The newspapers are crucifying us.

01:41:51.152 --> 01:41:53.229
- You hear Winchell last night?
- (buzzer)

01:41:53.363 --> 01:41:56.068
- Yeah?
- The commнssнoner's on the phone.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.402
There he is again. Fourth time today.

01:41:59.536 --> 01:42:00.947
Hello, Commissioner.

01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:04.330
No, but I've got Captain Moore
in my office right now.

01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:07.031
- No, not a thing yet.
- What do you mean?

01:42:07.169 --> 01:42:10.170
I'm not gonna be made the goat
for the whole department.

01:42:10.297 --> 01:42:11.875
(нntercom buzzes)

01:42:12.007 --> 01:42:14.166
- What is it?
- The mayor's on the phone.

01:42:14.301 --> 01:42:18.595
- Didn't you tell him I was out?
- He dнdn't belнeve нt.

01:42:18.722 --> 01:42:21.343
Hold on a minute.

01:42:21.475 --> 01:42:26.516
Hello. Yeah, Chief. I was just talking
to Inspector McCrary. Not a thing yet.

01:42:26.646 --> 01:42:29.398
I have had a supersufficiency of
"not a thing".

01:42:29.524 --> 01:42:33.937
I want some action, and I want it quickly.
Every editor in town is in my office now.

01:42:34.071 --> 01:42:38.816
And you'll get a front-page editorial in
my paper every day till something's done.

01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:43.079
It is a very embarrassing situation
when a reporter is not safe on our streets.

01:42:43.205 --> 01:42:46.289
If the city can't do anything,
perhaps the state can.

01:42:46.416 --> 01:42:48.789
We'll take it up
with the governor tomorrow.

01:42:48.919 --> 01:42:52.122
I want you to find
those three reporters, Commissioner,

01:42:52.255 --> 01:42:55.625
or I will be forced
to demand your resignation.

01:42:57.969 --> 01:43:03.177
McCrary, you dig up those three reporters
or I'll have to get myself another boy.

01:43:05.853 --> 01:43:08.937
Captain, you have 24 hours
to find those reporters.

01:43:09.064 --> 01:43:14.900
If you can't, you'll find yourself on the
other end of a broom at the horse barn!

01:43:15.028 --> 01:43:18.029
- What is it?
- I think we got an angle on the reporters.

01:43:18.156 --> 01:43:21.192
- Speak up, son.
- A funny thing happened.

01:43:21.326 --> 01:43:24.695
Last Saturday I met one of the boats,
to check the passenger list.

01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:28.530
- Two characters shoved me into a car.
- Why didn't you report it sooner?

01:43:28.666 --> 01:43:33.459
They didn't hurt me, just drove me around
the Bronx, then gave me taxi money.

01:43:33.588 --> 01:43:35.877
- Any idea who grabbed him?
- Not exactly.

01:43:36.007 --> 01:43:40.716
Two of our men saw Dave the Dude at the
pier Saturday night meeting some people.

01:43:40.846 --> 01:43:44.381
- And with his whole mob.
- Dave the Dude, hm?

01:43:44.516 --> 01:43:49.178
It's not much, but we're beginning
to look like a police department.

01:43:49.312 --> 01:43:53.891
Captain, you better put a tail on the Dude.
There could be a connection.

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:02.991
These are great, Judge.
Just a few more speeches.

01:44:03.118 --> 01:44:06.154
As Jimmy Durante says,
"I've got a million of 'em."

01:44:06.288 --> 01:44:10.582
"My dear Count, it is indeed a pleasure..."

01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:15.002
I'm charmed to meet you, Count.
I'm charmed to meet you...

01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:19.210
- All right, hold it, everybody!
- Quiet! Quiet!

01:44:19.342 --> 01:44:23.340
Listen. Queenie, take your broads
to the other side of the room.

01:44:23.472 --> 01:44:27.600
- You guys, I want to talk to you.
- Guys over here! Broads over there!

01:44:27.726 --> 01:44:31.225
Come on, move it! We ain't got all night.

01:44:31.354 --> 01:44:34.190
You guys,
you gotta remember something.

01:44:34.315 --> 01:44:37.103
You're not a bunch of bums.
You're a bunch of gents.

01:44:37.235 --> 01:44:42.312
Dude, you gotta make 'em stop with the
pistols. They making holes in the lining.

01:44:42.449 --> 01:44:45.485
I thought I told you to tell 'em
to leave the rods home.

01:44:45.619 --> 01:44:48.988
- Weasel, I told you - no rods!
- No rods. Come on, you guys.

01:44:49.123 --> 01:44:54.283
If we don't act like gents, we'll bollix
the whole schmear up tomorrow night.

01:44:54.419 --> 01:44:57.337
Now, you all got the speeches
the judge wrote for you.

01:44:57.464 --> 01:45:00.216
You know who you are, huh?
I don't have to tell you?

01:45:00.342 --> 01:45:03.213
- Who are you, Slops?
- Governor of the State of Utta.

01:45:03.345 --> 01:45:07.639
- State of what? No, no. State of Utah.
- Utah, metah...

01:45:07.766 --> 01:45:11.894
Look, will you read the speech
the way the judge gave it to you, please?

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.433
Don't yak too much. Smile all the time.
That'll get you by anybody, even kings.

01:45:16.566 --> 01:45:20.896
Kings, yeah. But these mugs? You smile
at 'em, you get a hand on the knee.

01:45:21.029 --> 01:45:25.406
You've had so many hands on your knees,
deary, you wear gloves for stockings.

01:45:25.534 --> 01:45:26.944
OK, settle down.

01:45:27.077 --> 01:45:30.244
Dude! If any of your he's
make passes at my she's...

01:45:30.372 --> 01:45:33.741
- No passes, no passes, no passes!
- You hear that? No passes.

01:45:33.875 --> 01:45:37.873
- No passes? Gee, what a party pooper.
- I don't wanna hear no more from you.

01:45:38.004 --> 01:45:40.840
Dude, this ain't a good speech
the judge gave me.

01:45:40.966 --> 01:45:44.465
- You handicapping speeches now?
- This count's from out of town.

01:45:44.595 --> 01:45:48.295
- So what?
- I tell him he's lucky to meet Apple Annie.

01:45:48.432 --> 01:45:53.390
You wanna tell him you'll fix him up with
a couple of dames? Just read the speech!

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.604
(all talk at once)

01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:58.142
Cheesecake!

01:45:58.274 --> 01:46:03.435
Tell 'em to be quiet. Quiet down, guys.
Will you please be quiet!

01:46:03.572 --> 01:46:05.648
Why aren't you practising?

01:46:05.782 --> 01:46:08.404
- I've been practising. Only...
- Only what?

01:46:08.535 --> 01:46:12.403
I'm as good as Louie the Lug is, and
if he's ambassador, I oughta be a king.

01:46:12.539 --> 01:46:15.624
Secretary of the interior
is bigger than an ambassador.

01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:19.914
I ain't as dumb as you think.
A secretary's a secretary.

01:46:20.047 --> 01:46:24.590
All right, all right, brain.
I'll make you the postmaster. All right?

01:46:24.718 --> 01:46:27.174
That's more like it. I save stamps.

01:46:27.304 --> 01:46:30.673
- Yeah. Judge, you got a new postmaster.
- Check.

01:46:30.808 --> 01:46:32.302
Come here, Mex.

01:46:32.434 --> 01:46:34.474
Give the speech to him now.

01:46:34.603 --> 01:46:38.102
- You're the count.
- I thought I was the governor of Florida.

01:46:38.231 --> 01:46:41.647
Will you just please pretend
you're the count for a minute?

01:46:41.777 --> 01:46:43.520
Go ahead. Shoot.

01:46:43.653 --> 01:46:45.776
Count, Your Honour...

01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:49.239
it's a rare... privy...

01:46:49.951 --> 01:46:52.075
- privy...
- What are you talking about?

01:46:52.204 --> 01:46:54.243
"It's a rare privilege", jackass!

01:46:54.373 --> 01:46:59.959
Does it say that? I didn't think I was
supposed to call the count no jackass.

01:47:00.087 --> 01:47:04.250
- You're giving me a headache, you guys.
- (boomнng voнce) Me too!

01:47:04.383 --> 01:47:09.210
What a bunch of ignoramice. Ignoramice -
that's more than one ignoramouse.

01:47:09.346 --> 01:47:11.552
Yeah? You too, huh? Here.

01:47:11.682 --> 01:47:15.015
- (clears throat) I'm losing my voice.
- Start practisin'!

01:47:15.144 --> 01:47:19.011
- I am charmed to meet you, Count.
- You stink.

01:47:19.147 --> 01:47:20.143
Jerk.

01:47:20.273 --> 01:47:23.358
No, you don't. All we need now
is a crying drunk.

01:47:23.485 --> 01:47:25.525
Give me one good reason to stay sober.

01:47:25.654 --> 01:47:28.939
You thought all this up.
You straighten out this menagerie.

01:47:29.074 --> 01:47:32.443
- Hey, guys, listen to Miss Martin here!
- Quiet down, everybody.

01:47:32.577 --> 01:47:33.491
- Quiet!
- Quiet.

01:47:33.662 --> 01:47:35.738
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

01:47:35.873 --> 01:47:37.912
Let's do one thing at a time.

01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:41.410
Forget the speeches for now
and we'll concentrate on the bowing.

01:47:41.544 --> 01:47:44.830
- Judge, show 'em how to bow again.
- It's quite simple.

01:47:44.965 --> 01:47:49.461
The movement is at the waist,
with a graceful gesture of the hand - thus.

01:47:49.595 --> 01:47:51.634
What's so difficult about that?

01:47:51.764 --> 01:47:55.215
Head waiters do it. Foreigners do it -
can't even speak English.

01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:59.597
All right, listen. Have a he and a she,
pair off and practise the bowing.

01:47:59.729 --> 01:48:03.941
- All you broads over here!
- Come on, girls.

01:48:04.067 --> 01:48:06.274
Pick out a guy and start bowing.

01:48:06.403 --> 01:48:08.859
Don't forget the gesture with the hand.

01:48:08.989 --> 01:48:11.445
Bow. Everybody bow. Bow!

01:48:23.587 --> 01:48:27.252
If I'm sober, why do I see things like this?

01:48:37.851 --> 01:48:40.520
Does the board of health
know about this epidemic?

01:48:40.645 --> 01:48:42.685
(woman screams)

01:48:43.481 --> 01:48:45.106
- What's the matter?
- Him.

01:48:45.233 --> 01:48:48.069
He tried to pick my pocket
where there ain't no pocket.

01:48:48.194 --> 01:48:50.234
(uproar)

01:48:52.658 --> 01:48:59.325
All right, hold it! You guys ain't taking this
thing serious. And you gals ain't either.

01:48:59.456 --> 01:49:01.947
But this is serious, all right.

01:49:02.083 --> 01:49:03.875
It's murder.

01:49:04.002 --> 01:49:08.499
You're probably saying "What's in it
for us?" I'll tell you: Nothin'.

01:49:08.632 --> 01:49:11.301
I mean, nothin' that
you can put in your pocket.

01:49:11.426 --> 01:49:16.337
After all, did any of us ever plant a bridge?
Uh... build a bridge or plant a seed?

01:49:16.473 --> 01:49:20.056
For once, could we just
do somethin' nice for somebody?

01:49:20.185 --> 01:49:22.225
This is for old Apple Annie.

01:49:22.354 --> 01:49:26.683
If something goes wrong tomorrow night,
there's no telling what'll happen to Annie.

01:49:26.816 --> 01:49:30.565
Maybe she'll put her head in the oven -
the perfect solution.

01:49:30.696 --> 01:49:32.735
So come on now. We're gonna practise.

01:49:32.865 --> 01:49:37.989
We're gonna get in there... Tell you what.
Make believe it's for your own mother.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:43.280
I oughta do somethin' for my mother.
They won't let me see her in solitary.

01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:45.742
(Dude) Now start practising, everybody.

01:49:45.877 --> 01:49:48.451
I say it again and again and again.

01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:53.547
This will never work, this will never work,
this will never work.

01:49:53.677 --> 01:49:55.504
Happy days.

01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:16.448
The music must be soft and mellow.
Nothing harsh, nothing raucous.

01:50:16.575 --> 01:50:20.359
Just the gentle drip of rain
upon an autumn leaf.

01:50:20.495 --> 01:50:24.244
- Yes, sir. I'll lay on the silk.
- Splendid. Keep it schmaltzy.

01:50:24.375 --> 01:50:27.992
(hums "The Marseнllaнse")

01:50:28.128 --> 01:50:30.416
- The new men?
- Yes, sir.

01:50:30.547 --> 01:50:32.955
- Trustworthy?
- Completely.

01:50:33.091 --> 01:50:37.718
- I'm just loving this, sir. Aren't you?
- Hutch, in here it's Christmas.

01:50:37.846 --> 01:50:39.424
Quite.

01:50:39.556 --> 01:50:44.183
# Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way...

01:50:44.311 --> 01:50:46.351
Yes.

01:50:47.814 --> 01:50:54.730
As Pascal said: The heart hath reasons
that reason itself knows nothing about.

01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:57.531
A handkerchief.

01:50:57.658 --> 01:51:00.575
- A handkerchief.
- It's in your hand, ma'am.

01:51:00.702 --> 01:51:03.407
Yes, of course.

01:51:03.539 --> 01:51:07.121
Lola, do I look all right?

01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:10.417
The head waiter at the Ritz
would give you the best table.

01:51:10.545 --> 01:51:11.541
God bless you.

01:51:11.671 --> 01:51:14.245
See for yourself,
Mrs E Worthington Manville.

01:51:14.383 --> 01:51:17.668
You'd make Cinderella look barefoot.

01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:21.841
I don't know who that is in there.

01:51:21.973 --> 01:51:26.054
I hope the whole thing isn't a dream.

01:51:26.186 --> 01:51:28.226
Give me my basket.

01:51:31.941 --> 01:51:34.433
Apples? Apples?

01:51:34.569 --> 01:51:37.143
Your beautiful dream's
coming true, Annie.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.820
God love you. Everybody's so wonderful...
and I'm so scared.

01:51:42.953 --> 01:51:44.992
- (knockнng)
- Come in.

01:51:48.417 --> 01:51:51.786
Shades of Aphrodite, goddess of beauty!

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.788
Oh, that man just fills a room.

01:51:55.924 --> 01:51:58.794
Never in all my questionable career

01:51:58.927 --> 01:52:02.343
have I feasted my eyes
upon such divine loveliness.

01:52:02.473 --> 01:52:04.880
Cut it out, Judge.
When's the Dude coming?

01:52:05.017 --> 01:52:10.011
8 o'clock, my fluttering dove, and bringing
the best-trained social lions you ever saw.

01:52:10.146 --> 01:52:13.064
- But can they fool the count?
- Fret nyet, my pet.

01:52:13.191 --> 01:52:16.892
You'll behold a miracle.
Orchids bloom where weeds once grew.

01:52:17.029 --> 01:52:19.733
- What if they make mistakes?
- The Dude'll kill 'em.

01:52:19.865 --> 01:52:22.735
- The poor dears.
- Pull yourself together, dearest.

01:52:22.868 --> 01:52:27.115
You're the proud mother of a daughter
whose engagement is being announced.

01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:29.703
And don't think of mistakes.

01:52:29.833 --> 01:52:33.783
If any mug pulls a boner, I'll flood
the room with a torrent of oratory.

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:38.298
- You're wonderful, Judge.
- I know. Here's the receiving line plan.

01:52:38.425 --> 01:52:40.880
You stand next to me,

01:52:41.011 --> 01:52:43.336
then Louise, then the count...

01:52:43.472 --> 01:52:47.137
- Yeah. And where am I?
- Right here.

01:52:47.559 --> 01:52:49.801
Dude and his mob
are at Queenie Martin's.

01:52:49.937 --> 01:52:53.471
- What are they doing there?
- I don't know.

01:52:53.607 --> 01:52:56.976
It sure looks big. They got
a line of cars out here a block long.

01:52:57.110 --> 01:53:01.404
- Stay on his tail. Don't let him get away.
- Right.

01:53:01.531 --> 01:53:03.773
Let's close off the block.

01:53:05.994 --> 01:53:09.909
Confidentially, at times I'm a bit ashamed
of my fellow Americans.

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.287
The way they fawn over celebrities,
particularly you titled nobility.

01:53:14.419 --> 01:53:17.835
- I think that is charming.
- They're like children.

01:53:17.964 --> 01:53:21.333
Tonight in your presence
they'll probably stammer

01:53:21.468 --> 01:53:24.552
and appear to be
tongue-tied and awkward.

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:27.883
- I beg you to make allowances for them.
- But of course.

01:53:28.017 --> 01:53:30.472
Different countries, different customs.

01:53:30.602 --> 01:53:32.310
Which reminds me, Judge.

01:53:32.437 --> 01:53:36.103
There is a custom in my country
which is not a custom in your country.

01:53:36.233 --> 01:53:39.187
I have been hoping
that you would speak about it.

01:53:39.319 --> 01:53:43.364
- Indeed, sir? What's on your mind?
- The dowry, my dear Judge.

01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:47.702
As yet, nothing
has been said about the dowry.

01:53:47.828 --> 01:53:50.069
- The dowry, huh?
- Sн.

01:53:50.205 --> 01:53:53.704
I am aware, of course,
that in America it is not important.

01:53:53.833 --> 01:53:56.241
But in my country
it is the first arrangement.

01:53:56.378 --> 01:53:59.711
In your country, yes. In my country...

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.256
The dowry, huh?
I don't know what to say, Count.

01:54:03.385 --> 01:54:06.220
- You crept up on me on that one.
- I beg your pardon?

01:54:06.346 --> 01:54:09.431
I mean, this is so totally unexpected.

01:54:09.558 --> 01:54:13.805
Don't you think it's...
a bit vulgar to speak of money?

01:54:13.937 --> 01:54:17.270
Well, let us be vulgar, then,
for a moment.

01:54:17.399 --> 01:54:22.560
I am willing to make a settlement
equal to 50,000 of your dollars.

01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:26.610
- You are? Of my dollars?
- Sн.

01:54:26.742 --> 01:54:31.487
I have been hoping that you would be
willing to make a similar settlement.

01:54:31.622 --> 01:54:34.706
Willing? Yes, yes, of course. Willing.

01:54:34.833 --> 01:54:37.538
Ah. Old Napoleon.

01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:40.374
Join me in a nippy with Nappy?

01:54:40.505 --> 01:54:42.545
Delighted, Judge.

01:54:42.674 --> 01:54:47.217
I see you keep your billiard table
in excellent condition.

01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:51.682
- Do you play?
- Do I play?

01:54:51.808 --> 01:54:55.224
Seсor, in Barcelona I am the champion.

01:54:56.062 --> 01:54:59.063
Well, now, isn't that just...

01:55:00.025 --> 01:55:02.943
- You don't say?
- Sн.

01:55:03.737 --> 01:55:08.280
Perhaps... a little game
before the guests arrive?

01:55:08.408 --> 01:55:12.073
I can think of nothing
that would give me greater pleasure.

01:55:12.204 --> 01:55:14.243
(both hum cheerfully)

01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:24.298
- Oh, about that dowry, Count.
- Yes, Judge?

01:55:24.424 --> 01:55:28.885
It just occurred to me, as the young folks
are going back to Spain to live with you,

01:55:29.012 --> 01:55:31.585
- I should give the whole amount.
- Oh, no, no.

01:55:31.723 --> 01:55:34.012
I could not let you bear the entire burden.

01:55:34.143 --> 01:55:37.974
But it's no burden, my dear Alfonso.
So, the matter's settled.

01:55:38.104 --> 01:55:40.144
Please, my dear host.

01:55:40.273 --> 01:55:44.105
You are so gracious.
You make me feel ashamed.

01:55:44.235 --> 01:55:49.146
- I shall take care of the full amount.
- It's silly. We could debate this for hours.

01:55:49.283 --> 01:55:52.817
In America we have methods
to settle such differences.

01:55:52.953 --> 01:55:56.238
- We toss coins or pull straws...
- (chuckles)

01:55:56.373 --> 01:56:00.702
- What's so amusing, Alfonso?
- I could take advantage of you, Judge.

01:56:00.836 --> 01:56:06.079
Indeed, sir? You wouldn't
suggest a billiards contest?

01:56:06.216 --> 01:56:08.042
(Alfonso chuckles)

01:56:08.176 --> 01:56:10.299
(both chuckle)

01:56:10.429 --> 01:56:13.382
(# "Blue Danube Waltz" by Strauss)

01:56:16.101 --> 01:56:18.853
- (phone)
- That's enough. You'll start sweatin'.

01:56:18.979 --> 01:56:21.019
(Junнor) No sweatin'! Nobody sweats!

01:56:21.148 --> 01:56:24.232
- Dude, it's gonna work, so help me.
- Get your coat, baby.

01:56:24.359 --> 01:56:28.227
Dave! Come here. We're in, kid, we're in.

01:56:28.363 --> 01:56:33.950
It's Darcey. Says you can write
your own ticket. Yes or no?

01:56:35.037 --> 01:56:37.076
On my terms, Darcey?

01:56:38.582 --> 01:56:40.242
All right. I'll tell you what you do.

01:56:40.375 --> 01:56:44.159
You bring Little Switz
to pier 84 at midnight.

01:56:44.296 --> 01:56:46.335
And bring the cash.

01:56:52.763 --> 01:56:56.381
- What do you think of my apple now?
- I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:56:56.517 --> 01:56:58.343
Ready, Dude.

01:56:58.477 --> 01:57:03.222
Folks, Queenie and I are leaving now.
The rest of you follow in groups of four.

01:57:03.357 --> 01:57:06.476
- And, Junior, you take over here.
- Good night.

01:57:06.609 --> 01:57:08.649
Good luck, Dude.

01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:14.316
Queenie, the Darcey deal's all set.

01:57:14.451 --> 01:57:16.657
On my terms.

01:57:16.787 --> 01:57:21.614
I'm gonna need you now more than ever.
So don't leave me.

01:57:23.418 --> 01:57:25.458
OK, Dave.

01:57:25.587 --> 01:57:27.626
Anything you say.

01:57:33.804 --> 01:57:35.843
That's him.

01:57:37.516 --> 01:57:40.801
Mr Dude, there's cops
all around the place.

01:57:44.898 --> 01:57:46.937
Thank you, mister.

01:57:53.031 --> 01:57:56.400
(Junнor) Like the boss said, you walk out...

01:57:56.535 --> 01:58:00.153
- Boss, what's the matter?
- There's cops out there. Millions of 'em.

01:58:00.288 --> 01:58:01.913
- Cops?
- What do we do now?

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.374
We can't go over to Annie's.
They'll follow us.

01:58:05.502 --> 01:58:09.167
Queenie, get the judge on the phone.
We gotta stall 'em.

01:58:09.297 --> 01:58:12.833
- What are they doing out there?
- I don't know. I don't figure it.

01:58:12.968 --> 01:58:15.720
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Let me think.

01:58:16.638 --> 01:58:20.089
- What amazing luck.
- I've been very fortunate, haven't I?

01:58:20.225 --> 01:58:24.686
24-24. You realise,
you make this shot, you win?

01:58:24.813 --> 01:58:28.016
Really? This shot seems
practically impossible.

01:58:28.150 --> 01:58:29.774
I have seen it made.

01:58:29.901 --> 01:58:33.602
It's a seven-cushion shot
with high, delicate right-hand English.

01:58:33.738 --> 01:58:36.146
- That would take an expert.
- I beg pardon, sir.

01:58:36.283 --> 01:58:41.111
Mrs Manville's brother-in-law
on the telephone. He says it's very urgent.

01:58:41.246 --> 01:58:43.286
I shall be there directly.

01:58:54.676 --> 01:58:58.590
- You made it!
- Most fortunate. Most fortunate.

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:07.595
- The judge... expert.
- Oh, sir, I beat him regularly.

01:59:07.731 --> 01:59:09.770
Thank you, sir.

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:21.285
Hello, brother David. Congratulate me.
I just saved you $50,000.

01:59:21.411 --> 01:59:25.706
Knock off the lousy jokes. We're in a jam.
The place is surrounded by bluecoats.

01:59:25.832 --> 01:59:27.872
Cops?

01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:30.326
I don't care for that at all, my dear Dude.

01:59:30.462 --> 01:59:34.875
Would you suggest that I fold my tent
and silently scram into the night?

01:59:35.008 --> 01:59:37.333
You better stay right where you are.

01:59:37.469 --> 01:59:41.301
- Just stall 'em. I'll figure something out.
- Figure fast, Dude.

01:59:41.431 --> 01:59:43.720
I'm notoriously poor at bag-holding.

01:59:43.851 --> 01:59:46.057
- What is it, Henry?
- Nothing, my dear.

01:59:46.186 --> 01:59:49.436
I heard you. You said
something about cops.

01:59:49.564 --> 01:59:52.435
- They're not coming here, are they?
- Of course not.

01:59:52.567 --> 01:59:56.435
- Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.
- Don't get yourself all worked up.

01:59:56.571 --> 01:59:59.442
If something's going to happen,
I have got to know.

01:59:59.575 --> 02:00:01.781
I'd rather tell them the truth myself.

02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:05.575
Mama! Look what the count
gave me to wear tonight.

02:00:05.706 --> 02:00:09.324
It's an heirloom that used to
belong to Queen Isabella.

02:00:09.459 --> 02:00:13.077
- It's beautiful, dear.
- It's going to be mine after the wedding.

02:00:13.213 --> 02:00:15.539
Carlos hasn't seen it on me.

02:00:19.386 --> 02:00:21.426
(door closes)

02:00:21.555 --> 02:00:25.802
She's a lovely girl, isn't she, Judge?

02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:30.810
- Don't you think she's lovely?
- Angelic, my dear.

02:00:30.939 --> 02:00:33.561
What am I going to do?

02:00:33.692 --> 02:00:37.820
Suppose the count calls off the wedding.

02:00:38.989 --> 02:00:41.028
She'd hate me.

02:00:41.158 --> 02:00:44.242
Don't be silly, Annie.

02:00:46.538 --> 02:00:50.916
She'll want to know who her father is.

02:00:51.042 --> 02:00:56.713
What am I going to tell you?
You see, I was never married.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:01.467
You won't have to tell her anything.
Now get a grip on yourself.

02:01:01.595 --> 02:01:05.723
Dude'll come up with something.
He always does.

02:01:16.610 --> 02:01:21.568
Before this evening is over,
I expect a complete apology from you.

02:01:21.698 --> 02:01:24.154
- That is why I asked you here.
- My dear Count.

02:01:24.284 --> 02:01:30.702
Nothing would give me greater
satisfaction than to be proven an imbecile.

02:01:34.252 --> 02:01:36.922
What time do the guests arrive?

02:01:37.047 --> 02:01:41.755
Well, no one arrives first, sir.
They all come in last.

02:01:54.022 --> 02:01:57.023
- Hey, Boss...
- Will you knock it off?

02:01:57.150 --> 02:02:01.195
Those bulls out there ain't got nothin'
on me, or they'd break that door down.

02:02:01.321 --> 02:02:05.650
But how am I gonna get all these people
to Annie's without them cops tailin' us?

02:02:05.784 --> 02:02:08.191
- You've got one ace in the hole.
- What's that?

02:02:08.328 --> 02:02:13.120
- Give 'em what they want: The truth.
- The truth, to the cops?

02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:15.373
Are you out of your skull?

02:02:16.545 --> 02:02:21.088
Wait a minute. I got what they want.

02:02:22.634 --> 02:02:24.674
Yeah.

02:02:24.803 --> 02:02:28.552
I'm gonna go down and see
the commissioner and make a deal.

02:02:28.682 --> 02:02:32.466
- The commissioner?
- Right. Take over, Junior.

02:02:32.603 --> 02:02:38.189
- Joy Boy, come on.
- I don't like it. I don't like the whole thing.

02:02:38.316 --> 02:02:40.356
Everybody, up on your feet.

02:02:40.485 --> 02:02:43.605
I didn't like the way you bowed.
We're gonna do the bow.

02:02:43.739 --> 02:02:45.696
- (moanнng)
- Let's go.

02:03:04.718 --> 02:03:08.667
Look, all I ask you, Commissioner,
is you just lay off me for tonight.

02:03:08.806 --> 02:03:12.637
That's all? Don't you want me
to give you the keys to the city too?

02:03:12.768 --> 02:03:18.474
- What's your mob doing at Queenie's?
- Nothin' that would interest you.

02:03:18.607 --> 02:03:21.892
You see, I just can't tell anybody about it.

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:26.190
But if you'll just give me a base on balls
for tonight, I'll save your badge.

02:03:26.323 --> 02:03:30.949
- What do you mean, save my badge?
- You wanna find those reporters.

02:03:31.078 --> 02:03:33.319
- You got those reporters?
- I got friends.

02:03:33.455 --> 02:03:36.491
All I gotta do is just
spread the word around those friends

02:03:36.625 --> 02:03:40.243
and those newsboys will show up
tomorrow just as good as new.

02:03:40.378 --> 02:03:44.211
All I ask you is, please,
just lay off me for tonight.

02:03:44.341 --> 02:03:49.133
I don't make deals with bums. You'll have
a police escort until they show up.

02:03:49.262 --> 02:03:52.466
Wait a minute. OK, Mac,
I'm gonna tell you something.

02:03:52.599 --> 02:03:58.388
I got those reporters, and they ain't
showing up until I'm good and ready.

02:03:58.521 --> 02:04:02.354
- Now are we gonna do business?
- Sure, Dude. We can do business.

02:04:02.484 --> 02:04:05.568
- Frisk these guys and book 'em.
- What?

02:04:05.696 --> 02:04:08.021
You can always do
business with the police.

02:04:08.156 --> 02:04:10.943
- This ain't gonna get you noplace.
- Get me the mayor.

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:13.994
He's throwing that big party
for the governor.

02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:17.739
- When he finds out what this is about...
- Why drag the mayor in?

02:04:17.875 --> 02:04:22.002
I bet he'll make a deal with you too.
He'll probably settle for about 50 years.

02:04:22.128 --> 02:04:26.541
There's nothing crooked going on here.
When you hear the story, you'll laugh.

02:04:26.675 --> 02:04:30.257
I'm laughing already, Dude.
I been waitin' ten years to laugh at you.

02:04:30.387 --> 02:04:33.970
- Hello, Chief.
- Hold it. Just before you talk to him...

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:36.555
Joy Boy, I told Queenie I'd tell the truth.

02:04:36.685 --> 02:04:40.517
I'm gonna give you the truth.
You'll think I'm nuts, but it's the truth.

02:04:40.647 --> 02:04:42.391
It's like...

02:04:42.524 --> 02:04:45.727
- Well, it's...
- Like a Mother Goose story.

02:04:45.861 --> 02:04:50.404
That's right. It's like one of those stories
you tell the kids when you put 'em to bed.

02:04:50.532 --> 02:04:54.232
Hold on, Chief. Dave the Dude -
bootlegger, racketeer and gambler -

02:04:54.369 --> 02:04:57.620
wants to tell me a beddy-bye story.

02:04:57.748 --> 02:05:03.501
OK, forget it. I'm gonna hang before I let
any fink of a cop give me the horselaugh.

02:05:03.628 --> 02:05:09.133
As for you, Mr Mayor... You tell Mr Mayor
he'll never see those reporters again.

02:05:09.259 --> 02:05:13.387
- Dave the Dude is in my office.
- I've gotta use the phone.

02:05:13.513 --> 02:05:16.265
He admits he's got those reporters.

02:05:16.391 --> 02:05:20.804
Good work, Commissioner! Dave the Dude
admits having the reporters.

02:05:20.937 --> 02:05:23.393
- Dave the what?
- Fancy-pants ex-bootlegger.

02:05:23.523 --> 02:05:26.809
- Excellent. Have they arrested him?
- Of course, Governor.

02:05:26.943 --> 02:05:30.775
But what do you suppose will happen
now? A bail bond and he's out laughing.

02:05:30.906 --> 02:05:34.156
- That's ridiculous.
- That's the way things go down here.

02:05:34.284 --> 02:05:39.527
Of all the nerve. Who does he think he is?
He can't make any deals with the police.

02:05:39.665 --> 02:05:42.831
There's an example, Governor.
You see? He makes deals.

02:05:42.959 --> 02:05:47.705
The Dude says if we don't let him alone
tonight we won't see the reporters again.

02:05:47.839 --> 02:05:51.458
- Why, this is outrageous.
- Don't get excited, Governor.

02:05:51.593 --> 02:05:55.093
It's quite the customary procedure.

02:05:55.222 --> 02:05:56.846
Bring the Dude up here.

02:05:56.974 --> 02:06:00.177
That's exactly what I said.
Bring him without delay.

02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:03.893
Don't worry about my guests.
This is more important.

02:06:04.022 --> 02:06:07.770
You criticise my administration.
Let's see what you can do with him.

02:06:07.901 --> 02:06:12.693
- I'd send a criminal like that away for life.
- Here's your chance, Governor.

02:06:12.823 --> 02:06:16.357
All right, Slops, up on your blisters.
You ain't bowing right.

02:06:16.493 --> 02:06:20.443
Lay off, Junior. I've bowed so much,
I've got a callus on my bellybutton.

02:06:20.581 --> 02:06:23.665
- Come on. Bow.
- Sit down, Junior. Save your strength.

02:06:23.792 --> 02:06:25.416
(phone rнngs)

02:06:25.543 --> 02:06:27.583
Hello. Dude?

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:31.216
You're where? With the police?

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:36.968
You're gonna go over
and pick up the reporters?

02:06:37.097 --> 02:06:39.136
Poor Annie.

02:06:40.267 --> 02:06:42.805
All right. I'll go right over.

02:06:47.983 --> 02:06:51.980
I feel sorry for the whole stinkin' world.

02:06:52.112 --> 02:06:55.896
- What's it gonna be?
- It's all off.

02:06:56.033 --> 02:06:59.900
Send the suits back. I'm sorry.
You can go home. Thanks for everything.

02:07:00.037 --> 02:07:03.287
- That's a shame.
- (murmurs of dнsappoнntment)

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:06.120
You learned how to bow, didn't you?

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:08.742
- I wish I could cry.
- (glass smashes)

02:07:08.878 --> 02:07:10.918
Come on, Junior.

02:07:36.531 --> 02:07:39.698
There's nobody at Queenie Martin's.

02:07:44.206 --> 02:07:49.449
No, no, Annie. Don't do anything foolish.

02:07:49.586 --> 02:07:52.836
Mama? Isn't anybody coming?

02:07:56.217 --> 02:07:58.257
Mama, what's wrong?

02:07:59.888 --> 02:08:01.927
Louise, baby.

02:08:05.769 --> 02:08:09.054
If you should...
If anything should happen...

02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:11.810
Mama?

02:08:11.942 --> 02:08:17.185
- You wouldn't hate your mother?
- Don't say things like that.

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:24.997
Is the count in the living room?

02:08:28.708 --> 02:08:30.748
What is it, Mama?

02:08:34.255 --> 02:08:35.916
La commedнa и fнnнta.

02:08:36.049 --> 02:08:40.177
Send the waiters and the musicians home
and call a doctor. Where's poor Annie?

02:08:42.973 --> 02:08:45.381
Annie, I'm so sorry.

02:09:02.326 --> 02:09:06.822
Count Romero, I'd like to talk to you
for a minute, please.

02:09:11.752 --> 02:09:16.876
I'm sure you must know
there's nothing in the world I want more

02:09:17.007 --> 02:09:20.257
than for my daughter to marry your son.

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:25.138
She loves him. Loves him very much.

02:09:26.433 --> 02:09:30.098
And I know he loves her too.

02:09:32.355 --> 02:09:35.440
Ever since Louise was born,

02:09:37.569 --> 02:09:41.068
I've lived for one thing:

02:09:41.198 --> 02:09:43.237
Her future.

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:50.827
And when she wrote me
that she'd found someone she loved...

02:09:50.958 --> 02:09:54.243
I was the happiest mother in the world.

02:09:57.631 --> 02:10:03.254
Count Romero, I know you came
to America to find out all about us,

02:10:03.386 --> 02:10:07.515
about Louise's family.

02:10:07.641 --> 02:10:13.098
- No, no, seсora...
- No, I don't blame you. You have the right.

02:10:14.147 --> 02:10:21.858
And it would be terrible after
they were married to find out that...

02:10:23.365 --> 02:10:26.864
that Louise's mother was...

02:10:26.993 --> 02:10:29.781
someone you would be ashamed of,

02:10:29.913 --> 02:10:32.784
that even Louise would be ashamed of.

02:10:32.916 --> 02:10:35.039
- That's silly, Mama.
- Mrs Manville...

02:10:35.168 --> 02:10:38.253
Let me go on.

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:43.505
I wanted this talk
so you would find out all about me.

02:10:46.137 --> 02:10:48.463
First of all, Count Romero,

02:10:50.517 --> 02:10:53.720
I must tell you that... I am...

02:10:53.854 --> 02:10:58.065

02:11:29.807 --> 02:11:33.590
His Honour, the Mayor
of the city of New York.

02:11:37.939 --> 02:11:42.067
Go ahead, Mayor.
It's your idea. Start beaming.

02:11:46.114 --> 02:11:48.687
My dear Mrs Manville.
So good to see you again.

02:11:48.825 --> 02:11:52.159
The last time I had the pleasure
was at your party at Briar Cliff.

02:11:52.287 --> 02:11:54.956
I will never forget it.
It was a brilliant affair.

02:11:55.082 --> 02:11:58.000
This, of course, is Louise,
the image of her late father.

02:11:58.126 --> 02:12:01.827
- You're giving us the good news tonight?
- So nice to see you, dear.

02:12:01.963 --> 02:12:05.379
You look just lovely.
Have you seen Lord Ferncliffe lately?

02:12:05.509 --> 02:12:10.135
- Welcome to our city, sir.
- You look younger than in the newsreels.

02:12:10.263 --> 02:12:12.303
Indeed? Thank you very much.

02:12:12.432 --> 02:12:14.639
This is my son Carlos.
His Honour, the Mayor.

02:12:14.768 --> 02:12:19.097
And you are the lucky young man.
Congratulations.

02:12:22.108 --> 02:12:27.186
His Excellency, the Governor
of New York State.

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:48.916
My dear Mrs Manville, what a pleasure
to see you again so soon, and so radiant.

02:12:49.052 --> 02:12:51.175
And this is the fabulous Louise.

02:12:51.304 --> 02:12:56.844
I've always admired you, so her beauty
doesn't surprise me. You know my wife?

02:12:56.977 --> 02:13:01.555
(wнfe) We're so happy to be here. We
wouldn't have missed this for the world.

02:13:01.689 --> 02:13:04.856
(governor) Count, allow me
to welcome you to New York.

02:13:04.985 --> 02:13:07.559
I'm crying.

02:13:07.696 --> 02:13:10.021
Dude, I'm crying!

02:13:10.157 --> 02:13:14.902
- Joy Boy, look, I'm crying!
- All right. I got my own troubles.

02:13:16.789 --> 02:13:18.828
(sнrens)

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:23.078
A police escort. That is more
than we get in Barcelona.

02:13:23.211 --> 02:13:27.161
It's nothing, my dear Carlos.
I've had many a police escort.

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.588
How about that?

02:13:29.718 --> 02:13:33.336
The mayor, the governor, the cops.

02:13:33.472 --> 02:13:35.511
I thought they were all crooks.

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.223
Why did they do it?
They gotta have an angle.

02:13:39.353 --> 02:13:43.350
Delightful experience.
Made me feel ten years younger.

02:13:43.481 --> 02:13:47.266
Are you still gonna investigate
the mayor's administration, Governor?

02:13:47.402 --> 02:13:51.649
I don't think so. I think we'll postpone it.

02:13:51.781 --> 02:13:58.745
I must call the commissioner tomorrow. I
made his life miserable the last few days.

02:13:58.872 --> 02:14:00.912
...the engagement of their daughter Louise

02:14:01.041 --> 02:14:05.169
to Carlos Romero of Barcelona, Spain,
at a gala reception last night, and so on.

02:14:05.295 --> 02:14:08.499
Take it from there and
include a complete list of the guests.

02:14:08.632 --> 02:14:12.380
- And that's your story, all of it.
- But what about our being snatched?

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:15.547
You weren't snatched.
You were out on a drunk.

02:14:15.681 --> 02:14:17.091
- Drunk?
- Drunk.

- Dry up. We're godfathers.

He's waiting. He's got
100 G's in small bills.

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:16.945
Boss, you got business. Can I have
the night off? I gotta go see Ma.

02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:20.907
Wait a minute. Listen, Dave.
My wife, I ain't seen her in a week.

02:15:21.038 --> 02:15:23.244
And she's this way again, so...

02:15:23.374 --> 02:15:25.746

What was the name
of that town in Maryland?

02:15:38.638 --> 02:15:40.465
