Hey!

02:38.025 --> 02:40.335
The basement.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.037
Hello. Hey. Hey. I'm down here.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.420
Just let me go, okay?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.086
Please?

03:00.113 --> 03:02.457
'Cause I... I didn't know
she was married.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.257
What are you... what...
what are you doing?

03:10.290 --> 03:13.737
Just look, it's...
it's a fucking misunderstanding.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.967
I didn't... I'm sorry, okay?

03:15.996 --> 03:19.671
She was begging for it.
What the fuck did you...?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.738
I didn't read that...
'cause you're her husband.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.148
I... fuck, I didn't...
okay, just-

03:26.173 --> 03:28.779
how the fuck am I supposed to know
that she was married?

03:28.809 --> 03:31.187
'Cause she wasn't even wearing
a fucking wedding ring, okay?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.317
I swear to God, I'm never-
I'm never gonna touch her again.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.588
I'm gonna get
the fuck out of here, okay?

03:36.616 --> 03:39.028
Just...

03:44.191 --> 03:46.694
You're... you're not
her husband.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.707
You're-

03:48.729 --> 03:50.675
you're just a sick fuck.

03:55.702 --> 03:59.047
Say something!

05:29.329 --> 05:32.139
Hello.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.771
- Up and at 'em, Deputy.
- Sheriff?

05:34.801 --> 05:38.647
I need you at the station
at 1500 hours.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.551
Wait. Why?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.953
Deputy Jordan's got my shift.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.979
Jordan's MIA.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.917
Wait, what?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.952
No one's seen him
since Thursday.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.898
Apparently he's gonzo,
out of here,

05:54.921 --> 05:57.527
got a whiff of something
he couldn't pass up.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.671
Sir, I can't work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.538
It's Christmas Eve
for all of us,

06:03.563 --> 06:07.272
the season of giving,
so get off your sorry ass.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.541
Town hall's expecting
a record number of Santas.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.549
It's gonna be
a real clusterfuck.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.575
With all due respect, sir,

06:14.608 --> 06:17.179
today is a really tough day
for me.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.520
It's my first Christmas
without John.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.187
Okay, well, I'll look forward
to seeing you.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.391
A six-sided item, nine letters.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.776
I'm home.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.342
I'm innocent, I swear. I swear.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.874
Police brutality!

07:20.907 --> 07:22.750
Help! Help! Help!

07:22.776 --> 07:25.518
Daddy, I'm sorry I can't be here
tonight, but you understand.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.752
That's okay, darling.
You just write

07:27.781 --> 07:30.091
as many parking tickets as you can
for all those other wannabes

07:30.116 --> 07:31.823
and then look for me
up on that throne.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.990
Oh, well, that would be cheating,
wouldn't it, Mother?

07:34.020 --> 07:36.091
She's straight as an arrow.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.069
- I am proud of you, kiddo.
- Thank you.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.698
There's a gift in the mailbox
for you, Hank.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.230
Give it here.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.107
Hey, Daddy,
what's a six-sided item?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.668
A cube.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.203
Nine letters.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.873
A hexagon.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.713
Close. That's seven.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.379
I'll figure it out eventually.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.786
Anyways, good luck.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.155
I'm not gonna need it.
This is gonna be my year.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.784
Of course it is.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.159
And in the morning,
we will open up Christmas presents

08:04.184 --> 08:08.633
and we will have leftovers and we'll
spend the whole day together, okay?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.726
- You be careful out there, hon.
- Of course.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.135
- You promise?
- Of course, Mother.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.732
And watch out for those drunken Santas
with the wandering hands?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.471
And no letting them off
with just a smile

08:19.499 --> 08:21.843
and a slap on the wrist,
not my girl.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.041

- Pain in the ass.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.551
But we're entertaining tonight,
and Mrs. Mayor has her standards.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.584
So you're not judging
the Santa contest then?

09:11.618 --> 09:13.120
No, no, no.
It's an election year.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.760
If I choose a Santa, I earn one vote
and lose the other 499.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.472

- Hey.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.637
Tiffany, please go put on
something more respectable.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.409
Respectable? What would you know
about respectable?

09:30.437 --> 09:33.008
I have important people
coming over tonight.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.781
You might think it's cool
for you and your important people

09:35.809 --> 09:37.755
to route a road
through protected land.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.256
I don't.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.556
This town will die if we don't
put another road in.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
It's already dead.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.328
All right, see you
at the Santa parade.

Yeah. You take care.

- I need those.
- You need to take me to the mall.

10:12.812 --> 10:16.259
But I thought
we'd go to church tonight.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.489
Fuck church.
I want my new LV today.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.930
Why don't you wait until tomorrow
and see what Santa brings you?

10:20.954 --> 10:24.026
Do I look like I believe
in Santa Claus?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.128
Go get your purse
and meet me in the car.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.348
Great. Salvation fucking Army.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.482
Got something for me?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.461
I didn't ask for that.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.831
Reverend Madeley.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.034
Do you remember the old days?

12:44.063 --> 12:46.566
Full house every Christmas Eve,

12:46.599 --> 12:49.512
Easter too.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.981
Nothing's the same anymore,

12:52.005 --> 12:53.643
not even the snow.

12:53.673 --> 12:57.416
Well, we've all lost a lot
this year.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.515
John was important
to the community.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.351
It's always hard

13:05.385 --> 13:07.831
when a loved one leaves you,

13:07.854 --> 13:10.767
no matter what
the circumstances,

13:10.790 --> 13:13.703
but I want you to remember

13:13.726 --> 13:17.037
Jesus loves you, Aubrey.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.407
He's always here for you.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.705
And so am I.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.316
If there's anything

13:30.343 --> 13:35.122
I can do to ease your pain,

13:35.148 --> 13:38.459
anything at all...

13:47.093 --> 13:49.573
I'm going to be late.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.831
You want me
to pour you a coffee?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.735
No, it's okay. I got it.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.262
- What are you reading?
- A survey.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.037
It says that Christmas
makes people crazy.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.634
They think it's the short days.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.840
Or maybe it's "Jingle Bells"
100 times before breakfast.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.453
- Where is everyone anyway?
- Sheriff's out,

14:36.476 --> 14:39.355
scouting the parade route
for suspicious packages.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.881
And where is Giles?

14:40.913 --> 14:42.688
Late, as always.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.889
So you hear about Jordan disappearing?
He flew the coop.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.659
Yes, that is why
I'm here today.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.462
I mean, he couldn't have waited
until after Christmas?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.162
Rumor is there's a girl.

14:51.190 --> 14:54.569
They're eloping to Milwaukee.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.403
Okay.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.431
Of course they are.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.848
Can you think of a nine-letter word
for a six-sided item?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.479
For my crossword?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.887
I'll Google it.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.858
What? No. The whole point is
to figure it out yourself.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.760
So why are you asking me?

15:23.222 --> 15:25.725
It is just so nice of you
to show up, Giles.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.534
Don't tell me... I missed a bank heist
and an alien invasion.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.202
If I can manage to put on my makeup,
blow-dry my hair and get here on time...

15:32.231 --> 15:35.940
The truth is,
I had to stop at the store

15:35.968 --> 15:38.676
and get something
for you ladies.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.615
Christmas presents
from you? Really?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.052
Don't rush me. Form a line.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.555
Oh, after you've been kissing
the sheriff's asshole, you're gonna-

15:45.578 --> 15:47.182
Oh, God.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.385
No, thank you.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.559
Sheriff's Department. Yes.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.533
Ma'am, which Santa Claus?
Ma'am?

15:56.556 --> 15:59.298
I see.
We'll send someone right over.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.838
You know that traveling Santa,
the one in the square?

16:02.862 --> 16:05.536
- Yeah. What's up?
- Well, seems he's been making kids cry.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.273
- What? How?
- Maybe he got a boner.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.212
Kids are squirming
in his lap all day.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.081
It's bound to happen
sooner or later.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.644
Has anyone ever done
a background check on you, seriously?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.384
I'll just take this one
on my own.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.982
What did I say?

16:37.563 --> 16:39.873
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.372
- Hi there.
- How are you?

16:45.404 --> 16:47.077
Fine, thank you.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.056
- Aubrey, Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Merry Christmas.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.818
Hi.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.966
Looks great. Good job.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.898
Happy holidays.
Merry Christmas.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.516
So what's your name, partner?

17:19.539 --> 17:22.348
- It's Timmy.
- Timmy.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.320
Well, to be honest, Timmy,

17:24.343 --> 17:27.551
I don't think you deserve
anything this year.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.060
I'm joking.

17:30.082 --> 17:33.188
You're gonna get everything
on your Christmas list,

17:33.219 --> 17:35.597
but if the presents aren't
under the tree tomorrow,

17:35.621 --> 17:38.465
you know what happened, right?

17:38.491 --> 17:41.529
Well, see, your parents took 'em
and they put 'em on eBay.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.301
That's right.
Never trust your parents.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.539
And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.514
lest I get in trouble
with the police.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.777
See, they send people
to check on me

17:52.805 --> 17:55.786
to make sure I'm not telling kids
the truth about their parents.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.152
So don't go snitching on me.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.179
Santa'-s little secret, right?
Shake.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.488
All right, superstar.
Now scoot.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.291
Santa sucks.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.729
What can I do for you?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.861
- I'm Deputy Bradimore.
- I'm Santa... Santa Claus.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.599
Do you go by any other names?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.698
Yeah, sure.
At Easter, I'm the Easter Bunny.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.733
On Halloween, I'm Halloweener...
an Irish-Jewish ghost.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.676
Days between, I'm Jim Epstein.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.374
And can I call you Jim Epstein?

18:23.402 --> 18:25.211
Well, you could if you wanted to ruin
the childhoods

18:25.237 --> 18:27.911
of all those cute little brats
waiting in line, looking for reassurance

18:27.940 --> 18:30.546
that they're gonna have lots and lots
of toys under the tree come tomorrow.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.613
Oh, a cynical Santa... cute.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.524
You're good.
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.323
You're not from around here,
are you?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.990
No, I'm from up north, a small town...
North Pole actually.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.862
And Colorado.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.425
- You move around a lot?
- What the hell is this?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.267
Why the inquisition?
I have a permit.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.795
Can I see it?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.434
Well, it happens to be
in my journal,

18:51.464 --> 18:54.468
because I'm a bit of
a passionate scrapbooker.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.280
Mind if I take a look?

19:03.309 --> 19:04.754
Knock yourself out.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.951
For 10 bucks
you can sit on my lap too.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.551
And we'll talk about
the first thing that pops up.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.585
So what's the big issue?

19:12.618 --> 19:16.327
We've been getting some complaints
about your behavior towards children.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.767
Well, if you're talking about
that whiny little brat back there,

19:18.791 --> 19:20.737
I stand by what I said.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.240
I speak the truth.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.765
So what do you want Santa
to bring you?

19:25.798 --> 19:29.575
A pony? How about
a big fucking box of reality?

19:29.602 --> 19:32.105
- How about you tone the fuck down?
- Oh, yeah? Or what?

19:32.138 --> 19:35.608
You can't revoke my permit.
It was issued by town hall.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.053
It's conditional upon
your adherence to public decency.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.250
Now I'm scared.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.885
The big cop lady knows
the letter of the law.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.259
So how come
you're not at home tonight,

19:45.284 --> 19:47.628
by the fire with your hubby,
baking cookies?

19:49.055 --> 19:51.057
What did you just say?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.933
Base, patrol one.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.995
Deputy Bradimore, come in.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.640
Patrol one, over.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.238
We got a call
from some carolers

20:04.270 --> 20:07.274
about a bad smell coming from
that abandoned house on Watson.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.684
It's probably a gas leak
or a dead raccoon.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.689
You have to send Giles.
I'm with Santa.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.816
Giles is busy.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.452
Doing what?
Changing his maxi pad?

20:16.482 --> 20:19.861
A missing persons' report for
Alana Roach. Her husband is here.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.626
Something happen to her?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.328
I think she left him
for Deputy Jordan.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.666
- Where did you get that from?
- Gossip.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.035
From who?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.540
Seriously,
I never reveal my sources.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.518
Brought you a newspaper.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.578
Couldn't finish the sudoku.

20:47.379 --> 20:50.053
Mom and Dad missed the flight,

20:50.082 --> 20:52.688
so it's just me.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.096
I guess it kind of sucks

20:55.121 --> 20:56.657
being in here alone
on Christmas Eve?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.965
Hell, you don't even know
what day it is.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.409
Anyway.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.815
I gotta go see Tiffany.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.952
You remember
my groupie Tiffany, right?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.480
I'm boning her
pretty regular now.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.653
You'd better watch out, boy.

21:25.251 --> 21:30.132
Christmas Eve is the scariest
damn night of the year.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.158
Gramps, holy shit.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.535
You're awake.
Let me go get someone.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.906
You see Santa Claus tonight, boy,
you'd better run.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.411
Run for your life.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.680
My grandfather... he's awake.

21:54.079 --> 21:57.424
- Mr. McKenzie?
- I swear. He just said something.

21:57.449 --> 22:01.488
Mr. McKenzie,
it's time for your bath.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.990
He's catatonic.
He hasn't said anything in over a year.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.771
Do you want to help?

22:09.795 --> 22:12.173
I'm running kind of late.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.991
It's disgusting.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.770
Jesus.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.409
Patrol one, over.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.435
Base. What's the problem?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.574
It's Deputy Jordan.
He's... he's dead.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.345
Are you sure?

24:34.373 --> 24:36.046
I'm pretty damn sure.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.612
He's wrapped
in exploded Christmas lights.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.750
Oh my God. What do you mean?
Like electrocuted?

24:41.780 --> 24:43.157
Oh, shit.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.220
You said Alana Roach was with him,
right? I need to go search the house.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.629
That does not sound
like a good idea.

24:49.888 --> 24:54.064
Wait for backup. Whoever did it could
still be there. I'll send Sheriff.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.044
Shit.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.331
Bradimore, Jesus, stand down.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.768
Jesus.

27:17.736 --> 27:19.647
Do you want to go home?

27:19.671 --> 27:20.945
No.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.247
You're shaking.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.687
Shivering. It's cold.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.021
You should have waited
for me to come.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.889
I had to make sure
that she was okay.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.555
Look, I'm gonna say this
for your own good.

27:32.584 --> 27:36.031
You're not equipped to handle
this kind of situation.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.694
I mean, we both know that.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.638
So don't go playing the hero.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.700
That's my job.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.541
Oh, Jesus.

27:48.567 --> 27:51.446
What a bloody mess.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.391
A big fella.

28:04.983 --> 28:08.829
See, I guess that's what happens
when you try to start a new life.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.856
I told him she was bad news.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.836
I mean, fuck, she was screwing
half the bloody town.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.566
Where's the husband now?

28:15.594 --> 28:18.803
Oh, waiting for the bars to open
so he can get drunk.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.936
- Should we go talk to him?
- No, Giles already did.

28:21.967 --> 28:25.312
He was at the auto shop all day.
The boss confirms it.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.341
No, he didn't do this.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.375
Well, then who did?

28:31.376 --> 28:34.789
That level of brutality...
it has to be personal, okay?

28:34.813 --> 28:37.419
A stranger just
doesn't make any sense.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.622
Murder seldom does.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.557
All right, see what you can get
off those footprints.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.662
I'm gonna set up our own
command HQ.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.639
You realize
with Calumet Road closed,

28:49.661 --> 28:51.163
that we're just completely
on our own?

28:51.196 --> 28:55.303
"Good. No state troopers, no FBI,
Miami."

28:55.334 --> 28:58.042
This is payback time
for those parking violations

28:58.070 --> 29:00.983
and stray cats up trees.
And I'll tell you another thing:

29:01.006 --> 29:04.476
This sick fuck is gonna wish
he never set foot in my town.

29:07.512 --> 29:07.778
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.816
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

29:09.848 --> 29:12.260
Oh, yeah, lean back.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.764
Oh, that's awesome.
You look amazing.

29:14.786 --> 29:16.356
Work it, work it.

29:16.388 --> 29:19.426
Oh, that's it, that's it. Okay.
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.301
Oh, baby, you're beautiful.
Stretch your neck out.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.829
Stretch your neck out.
That's it.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.172
Looking like an angel today.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.069
Frank is very very...
feeling it, baby.

29:30.102 --> 29:33.413
- God, Frank.
- That's right.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.383
So your website
can only be seen in Europe?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.190
In Europe and Asia.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.787
Awesome.

29:47.919 --> 29:51.366
Oh, your present's over there,
white envelope.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.267
Girl, you rocked it.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.402
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, have a great one, babe.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.581
Later, honey.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.992
Creep.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.738
Maria, baby!

30:29.761 --> 30:31.741
- That's good, the tits.
- You want it off?

30:31.763 --> 30:34.505
- Work the tits. Yeah, perfect.
- Yeah, I'll take it off.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.103
Work the tits. Work the tits.
Work the tits.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.375
Oh, God. Yeah, that's it.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.577
That's it. Oh, man.
You're looking great. That's good.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.423
Tiffany must have
forgotten something.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.757
Or maybe the Snowman's back.
We're running low.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.124
Goldie, get the door.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.325
Okay, okay.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.806
Hey.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.109
What's this?

31:17.476 --> 31:20.821
God, that's amazing.
Look at that. That's unbelievable.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.450
You're looking perfect.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.103
Frank?

31:34.126 --> 31:36.265
Yeah, that's it. What?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.537
Frank, run!

32:11.663 --> 32:13.006
No.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.604
Frank?

35:14.980 --> 35:18.484
Help me. Help me!

35:18.516 --> 35:20.723
No!

35:22.520 --> 35:25.364
Bastard! No. Please.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.893
NO! NO!

35:27.926 --> 35:30.270
Somebody help me, please!

35:30.295 --> 35:32.241
Anybody!

35:33.231 --> 35:36.110
No, no. No!

35:36.134 --> 35:37.704
Help me!

35:37.736 --> 35:39.841
No, no.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.078
NO! NO!

35:42.107 --> 35:44.383
No!

35:59.557 --> 36:03.403
Please!

36:23.448 --> 36:25.894
Well, the prints came from
a Cumberland work boot, size 13,

36:25.917 --> 36:27.191
so it's definitely not Jordan.

36:27.218 --> 36:29.220
They didn't deserve
what just happened.

36:29.254 --> 36:32.292
- Well, somebody thought differently.
- What do you mean?

36:32.323 --> 36:34.428
What I mean is that this wasn't
like a random,

36:34.459 --> 36:37.599
spontaneous act of violence.
Whoever did this had a plan.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.768
And whoever had a plan
had a reason.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.472
Well, who do you think
could have done this?

36:42.500 --> 36:45.106
Do you remember that article
that you were reading to me

36:45.136 --> 36:47.946
about Christmas making
people crazy?

36:47.972 --> 36:50.350
Holiday murders-Google that.

36:51.910 --> 36:55.050
Sheriff's Department.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.458
It's Crazy Betty.
She sounds a little crazy,

36:57.482 --> 36:59.826
something about blood.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.728
Yeah, a Bloody Mary,
most likely.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.664
She's been drinking, guaranteed.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.690
Sheriff's Department.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.330
Crazy Betty again?

37:08.359 --> 37:12.273
No, a Mrs. Morwood
over on Euclid.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.299
I'll go check it out.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.778
Wait, no.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.543
I'll go to the Morwoods'.
I know the family.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.950
Bradimore, you head down to the motel.
Giles, you meet her there.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.318
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.
- I really don't feel well enough

37:25.343 --> 37:27.186
to be fighting crime.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.317
I'm probably best served
just holding the fort.

37:29.347 --> 37:33.762
No, you are best served protecting
the good citizens of Cryer

37:33.785 --> 37:36.163
instead of your own sorry ass.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.463
So man up.

38:19.430 --> 38:22.604
What happened here?

38:24.235 --> 38:26.579
- She's dead.
- No.

38:26.604 --> 38:29.210
He skewered her
like a little pig.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.846
What?

38:31.876 --> 38:33.378
Did you see him?

38:37.916 --> 38:40.260
I'm really sorry.

38:40.285 --> 38:42.287
I promise you

38:42.320 --> 38:44.197
that we'll catch this maniac

38:44.222 --> 38:46.259
and he will pay
for what he did.

38:46.291 --> 38:49.295
- It's all my fault, Sheriff.
- No.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.001
- She was driving me crazy.
- It's all right.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.271
All I wanted for Christmas
was some relief,

38:54.299 --> 38:57.075
but I was talking about
boarding school.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.775
I didn't mean this.
I didn't want this.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.806
It's all right. It's okay.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.320
I deserve to go to jail.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.514
No, no, no.

39:05.543 --> 39:08.387
- Take me in.
- Stay there.

39:08.413 --> 39:11.121
Wait. Don't go in there.

39:13.117 --> 39:15.563
Once you see it,
you can't unsee it.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.176
Bradimore, Giles, come in.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.376
We have another homicide
on Euclid.

39:34.405 --> 39:37.079
A 14-year-old girl
appears to be speared.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.951
What do you see?

39:38.977 --> 39:41.651
Two dead here, sir.
There's a woman, Goldie Willis,

39:41.679 --> 39:45.627
and a Frank Forrester.
He runs a website, soft porn.

39:45.650 --> 39:50.156
Porn, drugs-
when did this town become so sleazy?

39:50.188 --> 39:51.690
Ever since the mill closed.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.498
They do what they gotta do
to survive.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.767
Oh, yeah?
You call this survival?

39:57.795 --> 39:59.968
And, sir, we found prints-
work boots.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.171
- They're huge.
- Looks like the same perp.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.942
The woman... Goldie Willis...
she was the first one to die.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.916
There was no sign of forced entry.
Whoever did this...

40:07.939 --> 40:10.112
she must have known him.
I mean, she opened the door.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.520
The last call that Frank made
was to a Mr. Snow.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.888
That doesn't ring a bell.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.053
I know a Mr. Cloud,
but he's Indian.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.997
Native American.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.796
All right, son, listen.
I want you to lock up the crime scene.

40:24.822 --> 40:28.292
Oh, and check out
that rat-infested motel.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.466
Somebody may have heard
or seen something.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.170
Sir, there's a video camera.

40:34.198 --> 40:37.475
Well, bring the damn thing in.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.049
Girls, I'd like to thank you

41:23.081 --> 41:27.552
for bringing some true
Christmas cheer to the town.

41:27.585 --> 41:31.032
If I could just get one shot
for the parish newsletter?

41:41.799 --> 41:44.746
Oh, you can do
better than that.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.749
Okay.

41:50.575 --> 41:53.886
One more for luck.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.085
That's right.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.928
Spread some joy to the world.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.493
Thank you.

42:13.931 --> 42:16.377
Hi, Dennis.

42:25.009 --> 42:27.114
Shouldn't we call in some help?

42:27.145 --> 42:28.886
It's Christmas Eve.

42:28.913 --> 42:31.120
And assuming they could
give a damn,

42:31.149 --> 42:33.060
it would be midnight
before anyone showed up.

42:33.084 --> 42:36.293
No, we're just gonna have to
take this maniac down ourselves.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.233
And that is where
our training kicks in.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.400
Who is that?

42:50.668 --> 42:53.080
Yeah. Later.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.482
- Maybe we should fast-forward it.
- What?

42:55.506 --> 42:57.713
Fast-forward.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.713
I'm just... I'm just making
a mental note to call the mayor.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.158
- About the killings?
- No, about his daughter.

43:04.182 --> 43:07.652
You know, just don't want to scare
people unnecessarily.

43:07.685 --> 43:10.725
But he's gonna find out sooner or later.
I mean, people are gonna be talking.

43:10.755 --> 43:13.065
He'll find out
when I find the killer.

43:13.091 --> 43:16.732
Never present to your superiors
a problem.

43:16.761 --> 43:20.334
Always present the solution.

43:20.364 --> 43:22.776
Right, here you go.

43:32.844 --> 43:35.450
Frank.

43:47.391 --> 43:49.871
God, you scared me to death.

43:55.333 --> 43:58.974
- Giles.
- I'm on my way in.

43:59.003 --> 44:01.916
Listen, we've got a lead
on our killer from the motel.

44:01.939 --> 44:03.646
Yeah, he's wearing a Santa'-s suit
and a mask.

44:03.674 --> 44:07.520
Well, that narrows it down, man.
The town square is like Santa central.

44:07.545 --> 44:10.287
Listen, this one's big, all right?
Size 13 boots, over 6 feet. Anyone

44:10.314 --> 44:13.124
matching that description... you bring
him in immediately for questioning.

44:13.151 --> 44:16.758
That's cute, Aubrey.
I'm gonna need some help.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.952
We're a little crowded tonight.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.522
There might be some room
at the front.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.136
I prepared a sermon.

44:58.162 --> 45:01.268
It's just a few words really.

45:01.299 --> 45:04.678
It's about the ugly side
of Christmas,

45:04.702 --> 45:06.978
how we surround ourselves

45:07.004 --> 45:09.484
with colored lights
and decorations,

45:09.507 --> 45:12.215
snow globes and gift wrap,

45:12.243 --> 45:14.245
how we convince ourselves

45:14.278 --> 45:17.555
that everything
is fun and laughter.

45:17.582 --> 45:19.926
Dig a little deeper, friends.

45:19.951 --> 45:23.831
Christmas has a dark side too.

45:23.854 --> 45:26.994
Remember that chilly night
in Bethlehem

45:27.024 --> 45:31.302
when baby Jesus was born
into this cold world

45:31.329 --> 45:34.936
and laid in the filth
of a manger,

45:34.966 --> 45:37.879
when King Herod

45:37.902 --> 45:40.781
massacred infants?

45:42.139 --> 45:45.586
Christmas has
some bad memories too.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.921
To truly appreciate
the beauty of Christmas,

45:48.946 --> 45:51.222
you must understand
its ugliness.

45:51.249 --> 45:55.163
Sin is the beating heart
of Christmas-

45:55.186 --> 45:57.325
pain and war.

45:57.355 --> 45:59.858
Fear and sickness,

45:59.890 --> 46:02.564
death and famine,

46:02.593 --> 46:05.233
"American ldol"

46:05.263 --> 46:09.211
and internet pornography!

46:13.104 --> 46:15.345
Thomas Guthrie wrote,

46:15.373 --> 46:18.013
"Who is the murderess"

46:18.042 --> 46:20.579
that takes his life?

46:20.611 --> 46:22.784
Sin.

46:22.813 --> 46:25.487
Who is the sorceress
that first deceives,

46:25.516 --> 46:27.689
and then damns his soul?

46:27.718 --> 46:29.755
Sin.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.030
Who is it that brings
old men grey hair

46:33.057 --> 46:35.469
with sorrow to the grave?

46:35.493 --> 46:37.769
"Sin!"

46:37.795 --> 46:39.797
Sin is the reason

46:39.830 --> 46:42.436
that our Savior

46:42.466 --> 46:45.709
Jesus Christ

46:45.736 --> 46:47.875
was born!

47:07.024 --> 47:09.527
I won't say a word.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.565
I won't tell a soul.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.112
Please don't kill me.

47:29.046 --> 47:31.890
One hour till parade time.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.417
Who's the big fellow
in the corner?

47:56.407 --> 47:58.978
Stein Karsson,

47:59.009 --> 48:02.013
used to be a foreman
at the mill.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.617
Haven't seen him around before.

48:04.648 --> 48:07.527
I think he lives
up at the motel these days.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.053
Crazy Betty's?

48:09.086 --> 48:11.532
No, the Four fucking Seasons.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.933
Nice.

48:18.863 --> 48:21.434
Base.

48:21.465 --> 48:23.706
Brenda, patch me through
to the sheriff, please.

48:28.472 --> 48:31.146
- He's a little tied up.
- It will only take a minute.

48:43.821 --> 48:45.630
This better be good.

48:45.656 --> 48:50.298
Listen, Sheriff, there's a man here-
Stein Karsson.

48:50.327 --> 48:53.274
He is a former log worker.
He's wearing work boots.

48:53.297 --> 48:56.176
He's huge.
He fits the giant Santa profile.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.202
What's he doing?

48:58.235 --> 48:59.908
Eating a burger.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.883
Well, that doesn't sound like
the kind of thing

49:01.906 --> 49:06.377
a serial killer would be partaking of
after five homicides.

49:06.410 --> 49:09.448
He lives up at the motel and
I remember his name from the registry.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.154
It could be our guy.

49:12.183 --> 49:14.663
Where are you?

49:14.685 --> 49:16.756
- Jack's Bar.
- All right, I'm on my way.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.996
Just don't do anything stupid.

49:20.024 --> 49:23.028
Gentlemen.

49:26.997 --> 49:30.103
Mr. Karsson?

49:30.134 --> 49:31.704
Stein Karsson?

49:31.735 --> 49:34.739
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

49:34.772 --> 49:39.050
I was wondering when was
the last time you were at the motel.

49:39.076 --> 49:41.078
This morning.

49:41.111 --> 49:44.251
And did you notice
anything unusual,

49:44.281 --> 49:45.817
any new people around?

49:45.850 --> 49:48.797
It's a motel.
People come and go.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.062
But you live there, correct?
You don't know any residents?

49:52.089 --> 49:54.091
No.

49:55.659 --> 49:58.640
How about a...

50:01.065 --> 50:03.136
a Mr. Snow?

50:06.704 --> 50:08.741
No.

50:08.772 --> 50:13.312
So do you have any plans
for tonight, for Christmas?

50:15.880 --> 50:19.225
I'm gonna spread as much joy,

50:19.250 --> 50:22.629
as many parcels
of happiness as I can.

50:22.653 --> 50:25.998
Then I'm gonna get
my girlfriend so wasted,

50:26.023 --> 50:28.162
she won't even know
if I fuck her in the ass.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.805
You don't seem very happy
about Christmas, do you?

50:32.830 --> 50:35.242
Let me tell you
about Christmas.

50:35.266 --> 50:37.644
It ain't all candy canes
and pretty lights.

50:39.503 --> 50:42.006
Christmas can fuck you up.

50:42.039 --> 50:45.452
I heard this story.

50:46.644 --> 50:50.649
This fella was pissed
that his wife left him

50:50.681 --> 50:53.855
on account of him being
a dull man.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.455
She took up with
a more exciting fellow.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.694
The husband was distraught.

51:00.591 --> 51:04.698
He went to the party
they were at

51:04.728 --> 51:07.572
dressed as Santa,

51:07.598 --> 51:10.977
took with him a weapon,

51:11.001 --> 51:13.845
one he made with his own hands.

51:16.607 --> 51:20.384
And he set about
killing them that was naughty.

51:24.982 --> 51:29.362
The wife's boyfriend ran,
left her behind.

51:33.757 --> 51:36.067
She begged for forgiveness,

51:36.093 --> 51:38.369
pleaded for her life.

51:38.395 --> 51:42.810
He had no mercy for sinners,

51:42.833 --> 51:45.040
burnt 'em to a crisp.

52:06.090 --> 52:09.128
He's still doing it too,

52:09.159 --> 52:12.197
every year a new town.

52:13.597 --> 52:16.476
Everyone knows that story.
It's an urban legend.

52:18.569 --> 52:20.571
It ain't.

52:27.511 --> 52:30.185
Have you been
a naughty girl, Deputy?

52:47.798 --> 52:49.607
Who put you onto me?

52:49.633 --> 52:52.204
Was it Frank, that creep?
That kid Dennis?

52:52.236 --> 52:54.910
Just stay calm.

52:54.938 --> 52:56.975
Karsson is Mr. Snow.

52:59.076 --> 53:00.578
Hey.

53:31.408 --> 53:33.820
Stop. I can work this out.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.620
You can't work shit out.

53:38.515 --> 53:41.496
Shit.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.299
Are you hurt?

53:51.628 --> 53:53.539
No.

53:55.766 --> 53:59.304
- Where do you think he went?
- Wherever he feels safe.

53:59.336 --> 54:03.716
Well, I'm on his tail now.

54:05.142 --> 54:08.277
There's nowhere safe.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.658
Shit.

54:21.291 --> 54:22.861
- Hello.
- Dad.

54:22.893 --> 54:25.635
Hi, princess.
Let me get your mom.

54:25.662 --> 54:27.232
No.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.266
I really need to speak to you.

54:29.299 --> 54:32.246
What's going on?
You sound upset.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.672
I'm not cut out for this job.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.743
Are you kidding?

54:37.775 --> 54:39.550
I spent 40 years on the force.

54:39.576 --> 54:41.681
I know what makes
a good cop, Aubrey.

54:41.712 --> 54:43.714
I'm not.

54:43.747 --> 54:47.194
I can't do it.

54:47.217 --> 54:50.960
I mean, maybe before
I lost John

54:50.988 --> 54:55.835
I thought that I was brave

54:55.859 --> 54:59.306
and intuitive like you, but...

55:01.098 --> 55:03.374
I'm not.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.710
I choked.

55:05.736 --> 55:08.649
Dad, I choked.

55:08.672 --> 55:10.709
Trust your gut.

55:10.741 --> 55:12.743
When the time comes,

55:12.776 --> 55:14.881
you'll know what to do.

55:20.684 --> 55:23.756
Listen, don't go to the parade
tonight, Dad.

55:23.787 --> 55:25.494
We have a situation
with one of the Santas

55:25.522 --> 55:27.798
and he could be
really dangerous.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.896
But don't tell Mom.
I don't want her to worry.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.998
She doesn't have to worry.

55:32.029 --> 55:34.031
This isn't the first time

55:34.064 --> 55:36.908
a Bradimore had to bring down
a bad Santa.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.005
You'll find him.

55:39.036 --> 55:42.245
You'll catch him.

55:42.272 --> 55:44.274
Good bye.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.689
Public enemy number one.

55:55.719 --> 55:58.427
- It's double S.
- Is it?

55:58.455 --> 56:00.958
Karsson... it's double S.

56:00.991 --> 56:04.029
Double S... double screwed.

56:04.061 --> 56:07.907
Listen, the bars will close.
The whole town shuts down.

56:07.931 --> 56:11.276
He can run, but he can't hide.

56:11.301 --> 56:13.804
I want this son of a bitch
behind bars before dawn,

56:13.837 --> 56:15.578
or my aunt's my uncle.

56:15.606 --> 56:17.210
I'm not so sure, Sheriff.

56:17.241 --> 56:18.982
You're not so sure
about what, Deputy?

56:19.009 --> 56:21.285
About Karsson.
He doesn't stack up.

56:21.311 --> 56:23.552
- To what?
- As a suspect.

56:23.580 --> 56:27.153
Don't put avocado
on the burger.

56:27.184 --> 56:28.390
What?

56:28.418 --> 56:31.490
Simple is always best.

56:31.521 --> 56:35.492
Look, Karsson killed
Jordan and Alana,

56:35.525 --> 56:38.028
then those two degenerates
at crazy Betty's motel.

56:38.061 --> 56:40.905
Hell, he even tried to kill you,
didn't he? Have you forgotten that?

56:40.931 --> 56:44.276
But Karsson was a coke dealer.
Why would he want to kill his clients

56:44.301 --> 56:47.305
and what would be his motive
for killing Alana and Jordan

56:47.337 --> 56:50.011
and the Morwood girl?
It doesn't make sense, sir, I'm sorry.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.647
There you go again. Now you're
piling hummus on top of the burger too.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.520
What if he was punishing them?

56:55.545 --> 56:57.354
He knew Alana was cheating
on her husband.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.759
He knew that Frank and Goldie
were making porn.

56:59.783 --> 57:02.525
And who would know all that?

57:02.552 --> 57:04.657
Someone they knew.
Someone they trusted.

57:04.688 --> 57:06.668
You mean, like a drug dealer?

57:06.690 --> 57:09.068
Sir, a drug dealer with morals?
Come on.

57:09.092 --> 57:11.072
All right, I read
Brenda's magazine.

57:11.094 --> 57:14.803
Christmas... the number one holiday
for people going nuts.

57:14.831 --> 57:16.902
That's motive enough for me.

57:16.934 --> 57:20.006
So I want you to get out there
and I want you to search every street.

57:20.037 --> 57:22.039
Come on.

57:23.206 --> 57:26.312
Past homicides around the holidays,
state by state.

57:26.343 --> 57:27.845
Thanks.

57:29.546 --> 57:32.755
Double S, my ass.

58:03.013 --> 58:04.515
Aubrey.

58:04.548 --> 58:07.119
Joe, hi.

58:07.150 --> 58:10.757
What's this I hear about a dead guy
over on Watson?

58:10.787 --> 58:13.597
Someone said the body was
electrocuted.

58:15.392 --> 58:17.770
I don't know anything
about that.

58:20.564 --> 58:23.010
I didn't believe it either.

58:28.372 --> 58:32.047
Karsson's here, close.

58:32.075 --> 58:33.645
I can smell it...

58:33.677 --> 58:36.453
the smell of fear.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.255
I don't smell it.

58:39.416 --> 58:42.260
No. Well, that's not because
you are not attuned.

58:42.285 --> 58:45.323
A crime fighter's senses

58:45.355 --> 58:49.132
switch to something
almost primeval,

58:49.159 --> 58:53.266
from when we hunted cave bears
and dinosaurs.

58:53.296 --> 58:56.072
Sheriff, listen,
I have an article

58:56.099 --> 58:58.602
from Metesca, Montana,
five years ago,

58:58.635 --> 59:02.242
December 26th,
a multiple homicide.

59:02.272 --> 59:04.377
The journal of the Santa from
"The Real Christmas Show"

59:04.408 --> 59:07.150
puts him in Metesca
at the same time.

59:07.177 --> 59:09.054
SQ?

59:09.079 --> 59:11.218
We're looking
for the wrong Santa.

59:11.248 --> 59:13.387
Epstein, we're coming in!

59:16.887 --> 59:19.094
Jesus, what a pigsty.

59:20.824 --> 59:22.667
He lives in here?

59:22.692 --> 59:25.605
No, he travels in it.
He's living at the motel.

59:25.629 --> 59:27.905
What a smell.

59:27.931 --> 59:30.104
See if you can find
any weapons.

59:32.369 --> 59:34.440
We're looking
in the wrong place.

59:35.639 --> 59:38.415
Just who the hell
do you think you are, Deputy?

59:38.442 --> 59:42.891
Don't you tell me
how to suss out a perp,

59:42.913 --> 59:45.951
not when you choked
the one time you had the chance.

59:45.982 --> 59:48.485
I fucked up.

59:48.518 --> 59:51.727
Okay? I fucked up, sir.

59:51.755 --> 59:55.498
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.608
You can trust me.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:11.941

January 1st.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.247
It'll be my
New Year's resolution.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.755
I love you.

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.984
At least one of my girls
is still sweet.

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.152
Now you go get ready
for bed, okay?

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.162
Only if you say good night.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.425
I will.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.967
Come here.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.466
What are you doing out here?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.600
Tiffany says
you finished the guesthouse.

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:11.340
It's a doozy...
two bedrooms and a full bath.

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:13.370
I'm gonna show him.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.747
- Make it snappy.
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:19.049
I want us all to drive into town
for the parade.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.385
This won't take long.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.266
Jesus.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.300
Mayor Revie.

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:46.371
Hi, sir. I just wanted
to wish you a Merry Christmas.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:49.384
Merry Christmas, Sheriff,
to you and the whole department.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:52.387
Thanks for another year
of keeping our town safe.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.582
I wanted to talk to you
about that, sir.

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:56.989
We have reason to believe

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:59.960
that we have a serial killer

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.259
at large in our community.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.300
Yes, I know, sir.
It is shocking.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.325
I am doing everything
in my power

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:12.170
to make sure that this maniac
doesn't strike again.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.607
You're breaking up, sir.
I can't...

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.872
Hello? Hello?

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.176
Hello.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:24.151
Bloody cell phones.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.185
Poor Santa Claus,

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.713
giving out a million gifts,

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:33.558
never getting anything in return
except stale cookies.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.387
It's true.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.764
Santa gets shafted.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.791
Well...

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.699
it's time to give back.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.473
I'm gonna lighten Santa's sack.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.190
It looks like Santa's gonna
come early this year.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:09.026
Shit.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:12.397
Is that my dad?

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.424
Don't stop.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.706
I have a surprise for you.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.732
Stay here.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:36.718
- Have you been bad?
- Fuck, yeah, I have.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.689
I'm ready when you are, killer.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.511
Okay, I'm not laughing anymore.
You can-

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.550
You dick!

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:45.992
You should have seen your face-
classic.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.356
How did you get over here
without me seeing you?

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.389
Get over where?

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.301
How did you get
from the bathroom

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.738
to the other side of the bed
without me seeing you?

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:01.368
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't in the bathroom.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.469
Okay, so the door opened
by itself?

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.811
Stop trying to scare me,
asshole.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.112
You know what?
I'm over this now.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.642
Fuck. Come on.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:15.212
Look, there's nothing.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.247
Come on, stop fucking around
and let's...

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.534
Tiffany!

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.936
Let me out of here!

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.133
What the fuck?

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:55.587
Hey! Open LIP!

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.952
Tiffany!

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:26.620
Santa, you forgot the cookies.

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:35.786
He's a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:37.957
hiding in plain sight.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.627
I'll call Brenda,
get a vehicle description

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.762
and a license plate
for Jim Epstein.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.794
He's Santa Claus, remember?

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:47.205
The parade is
the perfect cover.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.574
Nah, he'll be on foot.

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.073
Is there any way

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.777
we can call off the parade?

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.808
I spoke to the mayor, told him

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.684
I had the situation
under control.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.190
Listen, this freak
can't hide forever.

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:06.352
Sooner or later
they all make mistakes.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:31.649
Merry Christmas.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.090
Watch out, man.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.653
Watch it, buddy.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.062
Fake-ass Santas.

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.761
Shit, are you seeing this?
It's Epstein.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.962
Hey, look out, man. Come here.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.305
Shit, he's making a run for it.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.612
- Is that a gun?
- Get out of the way.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.522
Merry Christmas!

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.795
Merry Christmas.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.913
- Hold still!
- Freeze!

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:47.621
You nasty,
sadistic little prick.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.630
See?

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.893
I told you I'd get him.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.423
Cuff him.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.870
Get over here.
Cast your mind back,

01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:59.601
Christmas, '03.
Remember where you were?

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:03.099
Probably some herpes-ridden
crotch of a town like this, I suspect.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:05.874
- Deputy.
- Metesca, Montana.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.406
Does that ring a bell
in that dumb skull of yours yet?

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:12.682
My mind is blissfully bereft
of the effects of campanology.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.350
Yeah, well, four people were
murdered there Christmas Eve.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.757
The cops never found the killer.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:23.996
Judicial ineptness is
a universal curse. I fucking weep.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.694
Yeah, well, six people
died here tonight.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:30.569
I ask you,
what are the chances?

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.971
I'd say the odds of that
are pretty high.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.907
Because it's that time
of the year, Sheriff.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:43.179
Yeah, Christmas,

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.447
when people
go off the deep end.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.477
Yeah, you know why.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.615
'Cause they spend too much

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.522
and they drink too much
and they eat too much

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.527
and they think too much.

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.756
And they look around at all that
fake fun and happy laughter

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:58.959
and they go, "Where the fuck
is my cup of joy?"

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:02.026
Where is my figgy pudding?

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:04.129
Where's my stocking
full of gifts?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.107
Where's my Calvin Klein underwear,
my cable TV,

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:10.270
my replica Tim Tebow
NFL jersey?

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.301
Where's my fancy cologne?

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.509
Where's my gift-wrapped
Norman Rockwell wife,

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:18.678
and my beautiful,
happy, smiling children?

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.710
Where?

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.689
Nowhere.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:24.714
Where are my friends,

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:27.626
my beaming friends who worship
the fucking ground I walk on

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.926
"because I've had an awesome
fucking year, man?"

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.796
And it doesn't take much
to put people over the edge.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:35.598
Just a dirty look

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.764
or a bad word, yeah,

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.796
or a TV too loud

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:42.810
or some asshole behind you
leaning on his horn.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.676
Ring-ring! It's a telemarketer,
"Give me money for Haiti,"

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.409
or the Democrats,
or National Suck-My-Dick Week.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:52.010
It's the most wonderful
fucking time of the year!

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:58.753
But whatever it is
that you guys think I did,

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.783
I most certainly did not.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.666
Yeah! I'm Santa!

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.042
Who the fuck do you think it is I am?
Charles Manson?

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.415
I don't understand
how he did it.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.358
How does he go from
hearing kids' wishes

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.383
to going on a killing spree?
It just-

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:37.193
it doesn't make sense.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.565
I told you before,
murder seldom does.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.503
I want you to go look for
that other girl from the motel

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.336
and see if you can find
any more evidence.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.364
You're good at that, yeah.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:51.776
Giles and I will man the fort.

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:22.139
What the fuck?

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.873
Karsson.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.351
Turn around.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.649
Turn around.
