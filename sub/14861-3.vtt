WEBVTT

00:01.832 --> 00:03.334
I'm gonna check
that control tower,

00:03.334 --> 00:04.465
SEE IF THERE'S ANY AMMO.

00:04.465 --> 00:06.177
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE DAY I HAD AT WORK.

00:06.177 --> 00:08.629
CRAIG, COVER MY FLANK!
COVER YOUR OWN FLANK.

00:08.629 --> 00:10.341
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
Nothing.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.223
I JUST DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOUR FLANK.

00:12.223 --> 00:14.095
GUYS...
ARE YOU STILL MAD
ABOUT THE CHEESE?

00:14.095 --> 00:17.228
YOU LEFT IT OUT FOR THREE DAYS.
I wasn't finished with it.

00:17.228 --> 00:19.270
WHY PUT SOMETHING AWAY
IF YOU'RE NOT DONE USING IT?

00:19.270 --> 00:21.402
BECAUSE IT'S CHEESE, KENNY.
Guys, come on.

00:21.402 --> 00:23.814
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY DAY.
Oh, I'm sorry, William.

00:23.814 --> 00:25.196
WHAT'S GOING ON?
BECAUSE I'M OUT OF AMMO,

00:25.196 --> 00:28.199
AND CAPTAIN ANAL
IS ALL UP IN MY CHEESE,

00:28.199 --> 00:30.991
SO... THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT
TIME TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DAY.

00:30.991 --> 00:31.992
SO DANA AT WORK...

00:31.992 --> 00:33.864
HERE WE GO.
SUPER SEXY.

00:33.864 --> 00:35.206
SHE'S AT IT AGAIN. EVERY QUARTER
WE HAVE TO FILL OUT

00:35.206 --> 00:37.418
THESE HORRIBLE TC-57 REPORTS.

00:37.418 --> 00:39.710
UPPER MANAGEMENT'S
OBSESSED WITH THEM,

00:39.710 --> 00:41.712
AND DANA'S OBSESSED
WITH UPPER MANAGEMENT.

00:41.712 --> 00:45.376
HEY, WILL. HOW MANY TC-57
REPORTS HAVE YOU DONE SO FAR?

00:45.376 --> 00:47.508
23.

00:47.508 --> 00:50.131
SAD. I'VE DONE 36. YOU GONNA
STAY LATE AND CATCH UP?

00:50.131 --> 00:52.263
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAN'T.

00:52.263 --> 00:55.055
YOU'VE GOTTA GET HOME TO WIFEY
AND MAKE MORE BABIES.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.309
YEAH, IT'S HORRIBLE.
I HAVE A FAMILY WHO LOVES ME.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.982
MM. FAMILY--THE FLYPAPER OF LIFE
THAT KEEPS YOU FROM YOUR DREAMS.

01:01.982 --> 01:05.776
I'M GONNA GRAB A POWER BAR,
POUND SOME ENERGY DRINKS,

01:05.776 --> 01:06.857
AND WORK TILL 11:00.

01:06.857 --> 01:09.780
(whispers) OH, YEAH,
AND GET YOUR JOB.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.282
SHE'S VERY UNPLEASANT.

01:11.282 --> 01:17.077
SHE'S ALSO VERY UN-UGLY
WITHOUTAN UN-NOT-GREAT BEHIND.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.201
(gunfire on video game)
YEAH, THAT WORKS.

01:20.201 --> 01:23.083
WILL, WOULD YOU RELAX? THERE'S
NO WAY DANA'S GETTING YOUR JOB.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.706
KENNY, GET YOUR GUY'S FACE
OUT OF MY BUTT.

01:25.706 --> 01:28.709
WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR GUY'S
BUTT OUT OF MY FACE?

01:28.709 --> 01:31.132
I'M SERIOUS, DUDE. QUIT IT!
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.515
MY EARS ARE SURROUNDED
BY YOUR GUY'S TUSHY! (laughing)

01:34.515 --> 01:36.096
(door opens)
YOU LIKE BUTTS IN FACES?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.928
YOU LIKE BUTTS IN FACES?
(laughs) WAIT A MINUTE!

01:37.928 --> 01:39.180
COME HERE! NO!
LOOK OUT!

01:39.180 --> 01:41.182
CRAIG? COME ON, YOU GUYS--
Aah!

01:41.182 --> 01:42.683
YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH?
NO! WHAT?!

01:42.683 --> 01:47.027
HERE, HERE, HERE.

01:47.027 --> 01:51.612
I'M TELLING YOU, T.
GRANT IS SO SWEET AND SOBUILT.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.364
HE IS JUST A SOLID PIECE
OF MAN

01:53.364 --> 01:57.948
WITH SOLID... MAN... PIECES.

01:57.948 --> 01:59.540
BUT YOU LIKE HIS MIND, TOO,
RIGHT?

01:59.540 --> 02:03.414
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
IT CONTROLS THE... MAN PIECES.

02:03.414 --> 02:06.507
WELL, OF COURSE! I MEAN,
HE IS THOUGHTFUL AND KIND

02:06.507 --> 02:09.510
AND ALL THAT OTHER CRAP
I'M SUPPOSED TO CARE ABOUT.

02:09.510 --> 02:11.131
WE'VE BEEN DOING ALL
THESE PROJECTS TOGETHER.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.673
WE BUILT BOOKSHELVES.

02:12.673 --> 02:15.966
OH, AND WE TOOK A POTTERY CLASS
AT THE LEARNING CENTER.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.349
GUESS WHAT HE DID.

02:18.349 --> 02:24.815
(The Righteous Brothers)
♪ OH, MY LOVE ♪

02:24.815 --> 02:28.269
♪ MY DARLIN' ♪

02:28.269 --> 02:30.231
♪ I HUNGER... ♪
(moans)

02:30.231 --> 02:31.732
SOMEONE DOES THAT
IN EVERY CLASS I'VE TAUGHT,

02:31.732 --> 02:35.075
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IT'S AFFECTED ME.

02:35.075 --> 02:36.777
REALLY?

02:36.777 --> 02:39.490
HE "GHOST"ed YOU?

02:39.490 --> 02:40.701
FULL-ON.

02:40.701 --> 02:42.703
THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.
I KNOW.

02:42.703 --> 02:43.744
OHH.

02:43.744 --> 02:45.956
AND HE'S STILL "GHOST"ing ME.

02:45.956 --> 02:52.633
♪ OH, MY LOVE ♪

02:52.633 --> 02:55.636

02:58.178 --> 03:00.180
OH, MY GOD.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.392
I KNOW.

03:01.392 --> 03:03.514
YOU KNOW, WHEN WILL AND I
WERE IN COLLEGE,

03:03.514 --> 03:05.266
HE USED TO PICK THE LOCK
ON MY BEDROOM DOOR...
MM-HMM.

03:05.266 --> 03:06.357
BREAK IN MY ROOM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

03:06.357 --> 03:08.439
AND CRAWL INTO BED WITH ME.

03:08.439 --> 03:12.192
WOW, THAT SOUNDS
INCREDIBLY UNSETTLING.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.655
MAYBE I DIDN'T
DESCRIBE IT WELL.

03:14.655 --> 03:15.816
UH-HUH.

03:15.816 --> 03:18.489
IT--IT WASVERYSEXY.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.080
AFTER 15 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

03:20.080 --> 03:23.284
IT'S JUST...
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT.

03:23.284 --> 03:26.206
SO... TELL WILL YOU NEED HIM TO
DO MORE CREEPY ROMANTIC STUFF.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.250
IT WASN'T CREEPY,
AND YOU CAN'T TELL A GUY

03:29.250 --> 03:30.501
TO DO ROMANTIC STUFF.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.792
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S REALLY DOING IT

03:31.792 --> 03:33.634
OR JUST DOING IT
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM TO.

03:33.634 --> 03:35.676
THEN DO A PROJECT LIKE US.

03:35.676 --> 03:37.508
YOU AND WILL CAN SPEND
TIME TOGETHER.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.930
YOU'LL CONNECT,
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

03:39.930 --> 03:42.343
BY VALENTINE'S DAY,
HE'LL BE HIDING IN YOUR CLOSET

03:42.343 --> 03:44.515
WITH A STOCKING
OVER HIS HEAD.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.226
IT WASN'T CREEPY.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.442
WHAT THE...

03:51.442 --> 03:53.153
KENNY!

03:53.153 --> 03:54.445
UGH! I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:54.445 --> 03:55.856
I DIDN'T TRANSFER MY CLOTHES
INTO THE DRYER.

03:55.856 --> 03:58.068
I WAS GOING TO.
I SAW THE SIGN YOU PUT UP.

03:58.068 --> 03:59.280
THERE IS A SWORD
IN THE WASHER.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.912
IT PUNCTURED THE DRUM!

04:01.912 --> 04:03.203
(clank)

04:03.203 --> 04:04.745
WHAT IS THIS?

04:04.745 --> 04:05.956
IT'S MY ROMAN SHORT SWORD.

04:05.956 --> 04:08.208
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN
INTO MY HAMPER.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.420
AND YOU DIDN'T HEAR
5 POUNDS OF SHARP METAL

04:09.420 --> 04:11.131
GOING THROUGH
THE SPIN CYCLE?

04:13.043 --> 04:16.046
(loud clanking and rattling)

04:17.968 --> 04:19.259
EH.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.141
YEAH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A NICKEL OR SOMETHING.

04:21.141 --> 04:24.014
NEXT TIME, PLEASE DO
A VISUAL CHECK FORSWORDS

04:24.014 --> 04:25.936
BEFORE YOU DO LAUNDRY.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.848
(clank)

04:27.848 --> 04:30.441
OR DO I HAVE TO PUT UP
ANOTHER SIGN?

04:30.441 --> 04:34.815
I DON'T THINK THERE'S WALL SPACE
LEFT FOR ANOTHERSIGN,CRAIG.

04:34.815 --> 04:37.488
(lisping, British accent)
HELLO, SWORDIUS MINIMUS.

04:37.488 --> 04:39.660
LOOK HOW CLEAN YOU ARE.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.901
(inhales deeply)

04:40.901 --> 04:42.493
(laughs evilly)

04:42.493 --> 04:44.455
(whispers) SHH, QUIET.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.959
SO I WAS, UH,
TALKING TO BRENDA.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.622
SHE AND GRANT ARE REALLY
GETTING CLOSE.

04:51.622 --> 04:55.005
THEY DO ALL KINDS
OF PROJECTS TOGETHER.
(typing)

04:55.005 --> 04:58.008
IT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN
IF YOU AND I DID A PROJECT.

04:59.259 --> 05:01.051
(laughs) I DON'T KNOW.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.133
REMEMBER WHEN WE TRIED
TO STAIN THAT ARMOIRE?

05:03.133 --> 05:05.095
I ENDED UP CALLING
YOUR MOTHER A BITCH,

05:05.095 --> 05:06.557
AND SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.390
YEAH. SHE DID NOT
HAVE THAT COMING.
MM.

05:09.390 --> 05:12.893
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND I
TAKING A CLASS TOGETHER?

05:12.893 --> 05:15.275
BRENDA LEFT
THIS LEARNING CENTER BROCHURE.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.398
THERE'S BALLROOM DANCING...
MM-HMM.

05:17.398 --> 05:19.400
THE HISTORY OF TEEPEES,

05:19.400 --> 05:22.363
HUMAN HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.785
OH! HERE'S ONE
THAT COULD BE FUN.

05:24.785 --> 05:26.206
IMPROV.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.618
(chuckles) IMPROV?

05:27.618 --> 05:29.119
YEAH.

05:29.119 --> 05:31.872
COME ON. I DID A LITTLE IMPROV
IN COLLEGE. IT WAS GREAT.

05:31.872 --> 05:34.875
AND REMEMBER DOING IT
AT THE WEBSTERS' GAME NIGHT?

05:34.875 --> 05:36.216
YOU WERE SO FUNNY
WHEN YOU PRETENDED

05:36.216 --> 05:38.799
TO BE THAT SHY BARMAID
ARGUING WITH A DUCK.

05:38.799 --> 05:39.920
IT WAS ACTUALLY A NIGHTMARE.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.382
OH, YOU HAD FUN.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.924
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.
I'M JUST NOT A PROJECT PERSON,

05:43.924 --> 05:46.387
AND I HAVE A LOT GOING ON
AT WORK, AND...

05:46.387 --> 05:48.519
WHAT'S GOING ON AT WORK?

05:48.519 --> 05:53.233
UH, NOTHING. IT'S--
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST WORK STUFF.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.395
WELL, DO YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT?

05:54.395 --> 05:55.816
NO, NOT REALLY.
(closes laptop)

05:55.816 --> 05:58.399
NOT EVEN WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S GUARDING THE GATES

05:58.399 --> 06:00.571
OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE
FROM A CIRCUS MONKEY

06:00.571 --> 06:03.033
WHO'S TRYING TO BREAK IN?

06:03.033 --> 06:04.405
(imitates British accent)
YOU NAUGHTY MONKEY.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.828
YOU'RE A NAUGHTY,
NAUGHTY MONKEY, YOU ARE!

06:09.119 --> 06:12.372
(normal voice) SEE, THIS IS
WHY I NEED THE CLASS.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.593
GUESS WHAT I FOUND IN
MY CEREAL BOX THIS MORNING?

06:22.593 --> 06:24.134
SOCKS!

06:24.134 --> 06:27.137
ASOCK. SINGULAR. NOT SOCKS.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.769
AND FOR ALL WE KNOW,
IT WAS A PROMOTION

06:28.769 --> 06:30.140
FOR A NEW ANIMATED MOVIE

06:30.140 --> 06:32.182
ABOUT A GROWN MAN'S
VERY DIRTY SOCK.

06:32.182 --> 06:33.684
GUYS, PLEASE,
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.936
LET ME TAKE YOU
THROUGH THE HISTORY.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.317
AFTER MY DIVORCE,
CRAIG TOOK ME IN.

06:37.317 --> 06:39.189
IT'S VERY NICE OF HIM, AND THEN
HE BECAME A WHINY LITTLE DOUCHE.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.151
(sighs)
AND NOW YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.323
I'M SORRY, KENNY.
YOU MISSED A COUPLE THINGS.

06:43.323 --> 06:46.156
HE ALSO LEFT A ROMAN SHORT SWORD
IN THE WASHER,

06:46.156 --> 06:48.829
SPILLED PUDDING INSIDE MY PIANO,
AND FOR SOME REASON,

06:48.829 --> 06:50.370
HAS STOPPED FLUSHING
THE TOILET.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.202
I GET DISTRACTED.

06:52.202 --> 06:54.164
WILL, WHAT DO I DO?

06:54.164 --> 06:56.206
COME ON, WILL. FIX US.

06:56.206 --> 06:59.209
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW. UH...

06:59.209 --> 07:02.092
PROJECTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
GOOD FOR PEOPLE. DO A PROJECT.

07:02.092 --> 07:04.344
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE DON'T AGREE ON ANYTHING.

07:04.344 --> 07:06.887
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA DECIDE
WHAT PROJECT TO DO?

07:06.887 --> 07:08.178
WE CAN DIG A POOL
IN THE BACKYARD.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.140
I LOVE THAT IDEA.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.513
OR YOU COULD DO SOMETHING
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.685
POOLS ARE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE
PEOPLE WANT THEM FAST,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.266
BUT IF YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

07:16.266 --> 07:18.228
THEN YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN
FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING!

07:18.228 --> 07:19.650
OH, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED A POOL.

07:19.650 --> 07:22.272
PLUS I GOT THAT WHEELBARROW
WHEN MY NANA DIED.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.735
AND I'VE DONE
SOME CEMENT WORK--NOT WELL,

07:24.735 --> 07:27.067
BUT I'VE DONE IT,
AND PLUMBING--THAT'S BASICALLY

07:27.067 --> 07:30.240
JUST STICKING PIPES TOGETHER
WITH GLUE OR SOMETHING.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.742
I DON'T SEE ANY WAY
THIS CAN GO WRONG.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.034
HEY, WILL. DOPEY, SLEEPY.

07:34.034 --> 07:36.246
WHICH ONE'S WHICH?
YOU'RE BOTH BOTH OF THEM.

07:36.246 --> 07:39.209
SO, WILL, HOW FAR ARE YOU
WITH YOUR TC-57s?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.961
I'M UP TO 48.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.344
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION, DANA,
BUT I'M UP TO 49,

07:44.344 --> 07:46.677
SO I'M WINNING.
THAT'S GOOD.

07:46.677 --> 07:49.219
I LIKE A CHALLENGE.
IT INSPIRES ME.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.261
DOPEY. SMELLY.

07:51.261 --> 07:54.144
SKANKY. 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A TOTAL SKANK!

07:54.144 --> 07:57.147
GOD, SHE'S SO PRETTY. WE SHOULD
INVITE HER OVER FOR A SWIM.

07:57.147 --> 08:01.151
49 TC-57s?
DUDE, THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.694
I LIED. I'VE ONLY DONE 29.
I AM SCREWED!

08:03.694 --> 08:05.315
HOW DOES SHE DO
SO MANY OF THEM?

08:05.315 --> 08:08.028
I HEAR SHE GOES TO HENRY TRUNKA
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

08:08.028 --> 08:11.532
HE DOES 'EM FOR PEOPLE.
THAT GUY IS A TC-57 MACHINE.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.323
I KNOW THAT
BECAUSE HE SCREAMED IT

08:13.323 --> 08:15.245
DRUNK
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

08:16.577 --> 08:19.249
WE'RE GETTING THE SHOVEL.
THAT I DO NOT HAVE.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.252
HA HA! YAH!

08:22.252 --> 08:24.004
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.548
HEY, HOW MANY FEET YOU THINK
THE DEEP END SHOULD BE?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.841
WELL, I DID SOME RESEARCH.

08:30.841 --> 08:32.182
GUY AT THE COFFEE SHOP SAID
NORMAL POOLS ARE 8 FEET DEEP,

08:32.182 --> 08:34.765
SO I'M THINKING... 15?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.557
EXCELLENT.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.638
(thud)

08:37.638 --> 08:39.399
HEY.
YEAH?

08:39.399 --> 08:41.191
I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS
TOGETHER.

08:41.191 --> 08:42.983
ME, TOO.
YEAH.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.607
YAH!
HEY, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH ALL THIS DIRT?

08:48.859 --> 08:51.411
YOU KNOW WHY DIRT REMOVAL
IS SO EXPENSIVE?

08:51.411 --> 08:54.114
BECAUSE EVERYBODY
WANTS IT DONE IMMEDIATELY.

08:54.114 --> 08:55.786

17:11.861 --> 17:14.244
OH. I THOUGHT
THOSE WERE STEAK KNIVES.

17:14.244 --> 17:16.786
YOU GOT A TEXT.
"ARE YOU AVAILABLE TOMORROW

17:16.786 --> 17:19.619

IN WEST JEFFERSON?"

17:19.619 --> 17:20.960

17:29.879 --> 17:31.841
ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING
I DID.

17:31.841 --> 17:33.593
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
THREE WEEKS AGO,

17:33.593 --> 17:35.265
I WALKED BY YOUR COMPUTER
AND SAW THAT YOU WERE LOOKING

17:35.265 --> 17:37.807
FOR ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.058
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED IT HERE.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.640
I WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PLACE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

17:40.640 --> 17:41.851
YOU DIDN'T WANNA LIVE
WITH SUCH A SLOB.

17:41.851 --> 17:43.683
YOU FREAKED OUT
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR BANANA DOWN

17:43.683 --> 17:45.735
IN MY BEARD TRIMMINGS
AND THEN ATE IT.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.777
YES, IT WAS DISGUSTING THAT
SOMEONE WOULD TRIM THEIR BEARD

17:47.777 --> 17:52.242
IN THE KITCHEN
AND THAT I WOULD... EAT IT.

17:52.242 --> 17:53.823
BUT WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT
THAT MEANT

17:53.823 --> 17:55.575
I WAS GONNA KICK YOU OUT?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.957
BECAUSE...

17:57.957 --> 18:02.162
(sighs)
THAT'S WHAT BRENDA DID.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.503
(sighs)

18:03.503 --> 18:05.665
I WASN'T GONNA ASK YOU
TO LEAVE.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.878
I MEAN, WHO ELSE WOULD WATCH

18:08.878 --> 18:10.800
"DUKES OF HAZZARD" MARATHONS
WITH ME?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.922
OR DARE ME TO SLIDE
DOWN THE CHIMNEY?

18:12.922 --> 18:14.924
OR HELP ME GETOUT
OF A CHIMNEY?

18:14.924 --> 18:17.177
YOU REALLY BOUGHT
A 2-MAN FLOATIE CHAIR?

18:17.177 --> 18:19.849
WE'RE TWO MEN, AREN'T WE?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.142
MAN, WE GOTTA COMMUNICATE.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.723
IF WE'RE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER

18:23.723 --> 18:25.185
AND BUILD
AN AWESOME POOL TOGETHER...

18:25.185 --> 18:26.726
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.189
AND I'M GONNA COMMUNICATE
ONE THING TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

18:29.189 --> 18:31.901
I DID THE MATH THIS MORNING,
AND WE ARE WAY OFF.

18:31.901 --> 18:34.194
THIS POOL'S GONNA TAKE
SIX TO EIGHT YEARS.

18:34.194 --> 18:36.786
WOW.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.738
SO I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE
IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL.

18:38.738 --> 18:40.580
WE'D BETTER GET TO WORK.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.703
DUDE, I JUST TOLD YOU.
WE HAVE SIX TO EIGHT YEARS.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.955
(high-pitched voice)
TAKE IT EASY!

18:55.845 --> 18:58.558
OKAY, OKAY. YEAH, THAT'S IT.

18:58.558 --> 19:01.261
I HATE BEING "GHOST"ed
ALL THE TIME.

19:01.261 --> 19:02.602
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD STOP

19:02.602 --> 19:05.144
AFTER THAT HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING
AT THE A.T.M.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.359
I SEE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING THIS WAY?

19:09.359 --> 19:11.531
JUST NOW.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.653
A LITTLE WHILE.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.775
SO... YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO DO IT ANYMORE?

19:15.775 --> 19:16.946
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

19:16.946 --> 19:19.038
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M RELIEVED.
I ONLY KEPT IT UP

19:19.038 --> 19:21.661
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED IT.
(groans)

19:21.661 --> 19:24.874
WELL, FROM NOW ON, YOU SHOULD
SHARE YOUR FEELINGS WITH ME.

19:24.874 --> 19:27.877
REALLY?

19:27.877 --> 19:29.088
YOU THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR THAT?

19:29.088 --> 19:30.340
READY SPAGHETTI.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.131
OKAY. (sighs)

19:32.131 --> 19:35.004
YOUR BACK RUBS ARE
EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL.

19:35.004 --> 19:36.926
YOUR ORGANIC DEODORANT STONE
DOES NOT WORK,

19:36.926 --> 19:38.057
AND LITTLE PHRASES
LIKE "READY SPAGHETTI"

19:38.057 --> 19:39.759
MAKE YOU SOUND LIKE A DORK.

19:39.759 --> 19:41.851
THANK YOU.

19:43.303 --> 19:45.565
MY TURN.

19:45.565 --> 19:46.766
YOUR BREATH SMELLS LIKE
TAP WATER.

19:46.766 --> 19:48.358
YOU NEED TO TAKE A CLASS
ON GRAMMAR,

19:48.358 --> 19:51.981
AND YOUR RESISTANCE
TO RECYCLING IS STUNNING.

19:54.864 --> 19:57.277
YEAH, THIS COULD WORK.

20:00.119 --> 20:02.492
DON'T FORGET,
WHEN YOU GET TO 6-A,

20:02.492 --> 20:05.285
MAKE SURE ALL YOUR
EXEMPTION RELATABLES COINCIDE.

20:05.285 --> 20:06.536
COINCIDE WITHWHAT?

20:06.536 --> 20:07.997
EXACTLY.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.590
I'D RATHER BE BACK
AT THE LAGOON,

20:10.590 --> 20:12.382
CONNECTING WITH JOE.

20:12.382 --> 20:16.336
WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
TO GET THESE DONE.

20:18.007 --> 20:22.051
WE ONLY NEED 400 MORE.

20:22.051 --> 20:24.053
HOW YOU HOLDING UP, HONEY?

20:24.053 --> 20:25.555
I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING HERE

20:25.555 --> 20:27.106
THAT VAGUELY TASTES LIKE
DR PEPPER.

20:27.106 --> 20:32.272
♪ OH, MY LOVE ♪

20:32.272 --> 20:34.023
OH.
MMM.

20:34.023 --> 20:37.907
♪ MY DARLIN' ♪

20:37.907 --> 20:41.030
♪ I HUNGER FOR ♪

20:41.030 --> 20:42.992
♪ YOUR TOUCH ♪

20:47.497 --> 20:49.539
THIS ACTUALLY TASTES
LIKE DR PEPPER.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.752
IT SHOULD.
IT'S $20 A GLASS.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.424
THERESA'S THE ONE
WHO FIGURED IT OUT,

20:54.424 --> 20:55.715
AND WITH HER HELP,
I BEAT DANA.

20:55.715 --> 20:58.428
WELL, THEN VICTORIES ALL AROUND,
BECAUSE WE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH

20:58.428 --> 21:01.010
WITH OUR NEW POOL DESIGN.
WE'RE GONNA BUILD A GROTTO

21:01.010 --> 21:03.593
AND AN UNDERGROUND SWIM TUNNEL
BENEATH THE SHED.

21:03.593 --> 21:05.805
DID YOU GUYS PULL PERMITS
FOR ANY OF THIS?

21:05.805 --> 21:06.976
PERMITS?

21:06.976 --> 21:08.808
IGNORE HIM.
HE'S NEVER DUG A POOL.

21:08.808 --> 21:10.520
HE DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.772
YOU MEAN THE ABILITY
TO FORESEE CONSEQUENCES,

21:12.772 --> 21:15.355
LIKE YOU TWO FLOATING DEAD
IN YOUR SWIM TUNNEL?

21:15.355 --> 21:16.446
YOU KNOW WHAT, WILL?

21:16.446 --> 21:18.398
I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU TAKE
THE JOY OUT OF THIS MOMENT.

21:18.398 --> 21:20.239
OKAY? IN FACT,

21:20.239 --> 21:22.452
NOTHING COULD TAKE THE--
SNAKE! SNAKE!

21:22.452 --> 21:24.243
SNAKE!
DUDE, THERE'S A SNAKE!
AAH! AAH!

21:24.243 --> 21:26.245
WHERE'S MY SWORD?!
