Franklin Pierce.

Term?

01:29.489 --> 01:30.456
Term?

01:31.157 --> 01:32.125
Balki.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.660
Ow.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.263
Oh, you're still here?

01:37.297 --> 01:39.600
Cousin, I have to go to bed.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.802
Balki, all you have
to do is get an A

01:41.835 --> 01:44.705
on your history final
and you'll graduate high school

01:44.738 --> 01:46.406
at the top of your class.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.309
Well, that's very nice,
cousin, but, you see,

01:49.342 --> 01:50.911
we've been studying for hours

01:50.944 --> 01:53.847
and I'm scraping the bottom
of my bucket.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.417
Well, scrape a little deeper.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.520
Balki, nobody
in the family has ever

01:59.553 --> 02:00.754
graduated at the top
of the class.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.322
I came close.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.659
All I needed was a 96
on my geometry final.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.761
But Mr. Blanchard threw
in a trick question

02:07.794 --> 02:09.630
I only got a 94.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.398
I came in second to that
little tramp, Becky Jo Quinn.

02:14.568 --> 02:18.404
Cousin, my history final
is in four hours

02:18.438 --> 02:19.706
and if I don't get some sleep

02:19.740 --> 02:22.375
my brain isn't going
to be worth babbasticki.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.678
Balki. Don't you understand?

02:24.711 --> 02:26.780
You could be the first
in the family

02:26.813 --> 02:28.715
to be a valedictorian.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.652
Well, I... I don't
think so, cousin.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.454
I‐I enjoy eating meat so much.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.692
No, no, Balki,
a valedictorian is the person

02:38.725 --> 02:41.728
who is number one
in his graduating class.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.896
And he gets to make
the big speech

02:42.929 --> 02:45.532
at the graduation ceremony.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.234
‐ I could make a speech?
‐ Absolutely!

02:48.268 --> 02:49.936
And all we need to do

02:49.970 --> 02:51.805
is get a 100
on the final tomorrow.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.540
But, cousin,
getting a perfect 100

02:53.574 --> 02:56.543
on the history final is like, uh

02:56.577 --> 02:59.646
swimming across Lake Mypos
without getting a single leech.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.985
Balki, anything worth doing

03:05.018 --> 03:07.253
is going to be hard.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.555
Now...

03:10.390 --> 03:11.792
Concentrate.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.826
Ow!

03:16.697 --> 03:18.799
‐ Fifteenth President?
‐ James Buchanan.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.568
‐ Term?
‐ 1857 to 1861.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.903
‐ Wife's name?
‐ He wasn't married.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.938
‐ Why not?
‐ Who the heck knows?

03:24.971 --> 03:26.907
Cousin, I'm going to bed.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.476
Balki.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.678
You have the chance to walk

03:31.712 --> 03:33.880
into that graduation
valedictorian

03:33.914 --> 03:36.349

03:36.382 --> 03:38.685
Are you gonna let a little thing
like sleep get in your way?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.287
Yes. Now, cousin, I'm sorry

03:41.321 --> 03:45.826
but I am not studying anymore
tonight and that's that.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.927
Oh, that's that, is it?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.262
That is exactly what that is.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.431
I'm not studying
anymore tonight.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.766
My brain is exhausted

03:52.799 --> 03:54.400
and besides I know everything
in the book.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.736
‐ You know everything in this?
‐ Yes, I do.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.603
‐ You do?
‐ I do.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.346
Who is the vice president
of the Confederacy?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.414
Alexander Stephens.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.252
He was from Georgia.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.289
He weighed under
a hundred pounds.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.996
Who is the publisher
of your history book?

04:23.029 --> 04:24.931
‐ You're a sick man, cousin.
‐ Oh, you don't know, do you?

04:24.965 --> 04:27.333
Do you? Do you?
You don't know!

04:27.367 --> 04:28.569
Well, it's
the Warren Weber Company

04:28.602 --> 04:30.470
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.575
Cousin, my teacher's not
going to ask that.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.409
No. And I thought my teacher
wasn't gonna ask

04:36.442 --> 04:38.512
how many pages there were
in the textbook.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.746
But he did!

04:40.981 --> 04:42.082
The only person
who knew the answer

04:42.115 --> 04:44.284
was that little tramp,
Becky Jo Quinn.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.386
Now, are you going to be

06:45.606 --> 06:46.807
Well, Mr. Fong,
you didn't answer

06:46.840 --> 06:48.174
the extra credit question.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.511
‐ It's worth five points.
‐ Oh, I don't need it.

‐ Don't know it, huh?
‐ Uh, that too.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.571

07:17.604 --> 07:18.905
I can explain why I'm late.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.841
You see, I stayed up
all night studying

07:20.874 --> 07:23.143
and then I fall asleep
and then I didn't wake up

07:23.176 --> 07:24.945
until this morning
when Cousin Larry

07:24.978 --> 07:26.747
knocked me off the couch
and then

07:26.780 --> 07:29.816
I didn't really wake up until he
was carrying me down the stairs

07:29.850 --> 07:32.052
knocking my head against
the banister with each step.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.955
Just between you and me,
it's a lucky thing

07:34.988 --> 07:36.923
I don't have a percussion.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.827
Can he still take the test?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.096
Well, sure, but I'm afraid

07:43.129 --> 07:45.632
he only has 20 minutes
to complete it.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.534
Twenty minutes.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.903
It would take me 20 minutes
just to read this.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.872
Don't read it.
Go on instinct.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.977

07:57.010 --> 07:59.713
You can do it.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.849
You know the answers.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.519
But you're going to have
to work fast, very fast.

I‐I couldn't think whether
it was Andrew or Jermaine.

these papers in by noon.

the extra credit question.

credit question.

So I'll give you a chance
to answer it.

you will be number one

11:12.405 --> 11:14.107
I let you down.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.275
I should have remembered

it's the Warren Weber Company

to make my speech.

I want to go buy

Oh, the speech that I make
at the graduation ceremony.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.753
Uh, there is no
graduation ceremony.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.890

my speech at the prom

12:07.227 --> 12:09.195

Uh, there's no prom, either.

there's no class picture.

You mean I don't get
to make a speech?

12:31.351 --> 12:33.419
It's a school policy.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.288

12:46.266 --> 12:48.168
I'm sorry, Balki.

12:48.201 --> 12:52.072
I had no idea,
everybody gets a graduation.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.808
No, cousin, it's alright.
It's really alright.

12:54.841 --> 12:58.011
Um, but if you don't mind
I'm going to walk home

12:58.044 --> 13:00.146
I just... I wanna be alone
for just a moment.

13:08.522 --> 13:11.057
It's not fair.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.827
He deserves a graduation.
They all do.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.329
Night school students
work‐work harder

13:16.362 --> 13:19.866
than anyone to get
th‐their diplomas.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.036
They didn't do it the easy way
like you and I did.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.238
Living at home, going to school
during the day

13:25.271 --> 13:27.140
having all night to do homework.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.110
No, no. They have to‐to go
to classes in the evening

13:30.143 --> 13:32.913
because they have jobs
during the day.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.915
They study whenever
they can find the time.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.417
On the bus, on the way
to work, on the weekends.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.952
And what do they get from you?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.420
You'll get your diploma
in the mail.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.556
‐ Can you spare the postage?
‐ Uh, listen, uh‐‐

13:42.589 --> 13:45.892
No, no, no! Hear me out!

13:45.926 --> 13:47.961
These people earn
their diplomas.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.532
If anyone deserves
a graduation, they do.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.969
My summer camp had a graduation.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.571
Even dog obedience school
has a graduation.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.573
And all they have to do is
learn to go on the paper.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.545
If you have any decency...

14:04.578 --> 14:07.013
...any compassion...

14:07.047 --> 14:09.315
...any sense of justice

14:09.349 --> 14:12.285
you will see
that these people get

14:12.318 --> 14:15.288
their own graduation ceremony.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.967
That was very moving...

14:28.401 --> 14:30.203
...but I don't work
here anymore.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.108
After I turn these papers in,
I'm finished for the semester.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.146
Aw, come on.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.217
Can't you do something?

14:45.552 --> 14:49.523
Well... I guess we could
go talk to the principal.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.526
Thank you. Thank you.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.161
And try not to grovel.
She'll eat you alive.

15:01.702 --> 15:04.270
[instrumental music]

15:20.386 --> 15:22.689
‐ Cousin.
‐ Balki.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.725
‐ I have to talk to you.
‐ I have to talk to you too.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.593
Me first.
I spoke to Mr. Jones and he‐‐

15:26.627 --> 15:29.195
Cousin, cousin, cousin,
please, please.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.732
Look, I've been walking
around the windy city

15:31.765 --> 15:34.467
for two hours feeling
sorry for myself

15:34.500 --> 15:36.537
and then just before my lips

15:36.570 --> 15:40.040
were chapped beyond
recognition...

15:40.073 --> 15:43.977
...I say to myself "Balki,
what the matter with you is?"

15:45.245 --> 15:48.314
Not only did I graduate from
high school, but thanks to you

15:48.348 --> 15:50.250
I graduate number one
in my class.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.317
Well, wait till you hear
what I have‐‐

15:51.351 --> 15:54.087
And, cousin, isn't‐isn't
that enough?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.456
I mean, let's be real!

15:56.489 --> 15:59.526
I didn't know about any
graduation ceremony

15:59.560 --> 16:01.194
or giving a speech

16:01.227 --> 16:04.197
or going to a prom
until you told me.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.499
So why, why should I feel like

16:06.533 --> 16:09.035
my heart has been torn out
by the roots?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.140
I am a high school graduate.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.542
I can cope.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.082
You mean you really don't care

16:22.115 --> 16:24.450
whether you have
a graduation ceremony or not?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.521
Oh, cousin, I'm past that.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.225
And giving the valedictory
speech means nothing any more?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.496
Cousin... this is a mature...

16:36.530 --> 16:38.999
...adult Balki
you're talking to.

16:41.201 --> 16:45.105
So, if I told you that Mr. Jones
and I spoke to your principal

16:45.138 --> 16:47.207
and your class is going to have

16:47.240 --> 16:49.142
a graduation ceremony
you would say‐‐

16:49.175 --> 16:51.077
Cowabunga!

16:51.111 --> 16:53.479
This is the happiest day
of my life.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.416
And you did it! You did it!

16:56.449 --> 16:58.351
Balki! Balki! Balki!

16:58.384 --> 16:59.786
If you don't put me down

16:59.820 --> 17:02.022
there's something else
I'm going to do.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.258
Oh, oh, oh.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.694
Cousin, I'm sorry.

17:07.728 --> 17:10.463
I'm‐I'm just... I'm so happy.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.333
I get to have
a graduation ceremony.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.201
And I get to give a speech.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.270
I hope my lips heal in time.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.142
Cousin, I can't believe this.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.710
How can I ever thank you?

17:23.743 --> 17:26.378
Just give a great speech.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.580
If you need any help

17:27.614 --> 17:30.216
you can always use the one
I wrote, but never got to use

17:30.250 --> 17:32.418
because of that little tramp,
Becky Jo Quinn.

17:35.856 --> 17:38.391
Cousin...

17:38.424 --> 17:41.161
...you're going to have
to let that go.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.366
[instrumental music]

17:56.510 --> 18:00.446
Graduation. Boy, does
this bring back memories?

18:00.480 --> 18:04.350
You know, I was voted
most likely to succeed.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.187
Well, we all have our
little disappointments.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.260
Larry's such a sweet guy to go
to all this trouble for Balki.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.361
I'm so excited.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.462
I have never known anyone

18:16.496 --> 18:17.798
who graduated first
in their class.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.835
We've got to move this along.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.870
Traffic school meets
here in an hour.

18:25.506 --> 18:27.440
It's time.
Let's take our seats.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.122
[instrumental music on player]

18:52.398 --> 18:55.401
What a coincidence. They
played that at my graduation.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.272
[music stops]

18:59.305 --> 19:02.509
I wanna thank you
all for coming.

19:02.543 --> 19:04.878
Before I hand out
the diplomas, we'll hear

19:04.911 --> 19:08.649
from our valedictorian,
Mr. Balki Bartokomous.

19:08.682 --> 19:10.617
[applauding]

19:14.855 --> 19:16.322
Thank you.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.627
I'm a little nervous.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.764
The last time I spoke
to a group this size

19:23.797 --> 19:25.799
they were grazing
on a hillside.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.607
I... I don't know
how to make a speech.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.677
But I can tell you what I feel.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.882
Right now, I'm so happy
that it's like

19:41.915 --> 19:44.918
skyrockets are going off
inside my heart.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.689
There goes one now.

19:50.891 --> 19:54.360
You know, just a short while ago

19:54.394 --> 19:57.698
I was tending sheep
on the hillsides of Mypos

19:57.731 --> 20:00.901
and my only possessions
were the bearwood staff

20:00.934 --> 20:02.636
that my grandfather give me

20:02.669 --> 20:04.838
and my heavy wool blanket

20:04.871 --> 20:06.773
to keep out the cold and

20:06.807 --> 20:09.275
and, of course, my Sony Walkman.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.717
I didn't even know
what a valedictorian was

20:17.551 --> 20:19.285
and now...

20:20.821 --> 20:22.222
...I am one.

20:24.525 --> 20:25.826
I keep thinking any minute

20:25.859 --> 20:27.961
somebody's going to walk
through the door and say

20:27.994 --> 20:30.964
"Hey you!
What you think you're doing?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.934
You think you really get
to live in this nice place

20:33.967 --> 20:36.436
and have a nice job

20:36.469 --> 20:39.773
and have wonderful friends
and get an education?

20:39.806 --> 20:43.610
Get real, farm boy."

20:43.644 --> 20:46.747
But... it is real.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.049
I live in America.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.284
I have a job.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.987
I‐I get to pay taxes.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.426
I even have a Visa card
with a $200 limit.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.599
And in just a minute

21:05.632 --> 21:08.969
I'm going to have
a high school diploma.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.841
That's really something special.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.811
I think that my fellow graduates

21:17.844 --> 21:21.281
and I are going
to make you very proud.

21:22.683 --> 21:27.788
We have a... big curiosity

21:27.821 --> 21:32.358
to learn things
and a big feeling

21:32.392 --> 21:35.461
of how lucky we are
to live in America

21:35.495 --> 21:38.965
and a... a big wish

21:38.999 --> 21:42.368
that we can make America...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.971
...as happy as America makes us.

21:47.107 --> 21:49.042
[sighing]

21:49.075 --> 21:51.011
That's all that's in there.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.915
I'm finished now.

21:54.948 --> 21:56.482
[applauding]

21:58.719 --> 22:01.722
[instrumental music]

22:15.736 --> 22:16.803
Cousin, I don't understand

22:16.837 --> 22:18.639
the school is only
a mile from here.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.406
We've been driving around
for an hour.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.543
Balki, it's tradition.

22:22.576 --> 22:24.144
You graduate,
you drive to Evanston.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.846
Everybody does it.

22:29.750 --> 22:32.452
[instrumental music]

22:33.053 --> 22:34.988
Welcome to your prom.

22:42.763 --> 22:44.698
Congratulations, baby.

22:57.978 --> 22:59.913
May I have this dance?

23:04.651 --> 23:07.588
[music continues]

23:33.847 --> 23:36.783
[music continues]

23:43.489 --> 23:45.859
