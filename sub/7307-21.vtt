WEBVTT

00:06.856 --> 00:08.434
All right, dude, you're set.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.608
This is gonna be epic.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.905
We pull this off, and Johnny Knoxville's
gonna be asking us for a job.

00:23.998 --> 00:27.782
- Only job anyone's asking you for...
- Guys, shut up and concentrate.

00:27.919 --> 00:29.958
You let me go before
I'm behind that line

00:30.046 --> 00:31.706
and things are gonna get ugly.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.752
You sure that line's
where you need to be?

00:35.676 --> 00:37.468
I did the math, bro.

00:41.057 --> 00:43.180
All right, Zack, you ready?

00:43.643 --> 00:45.102
All right, guys.

00:45.186 --> 00:46.929
I'm Chuck Mannis

00:47.355 --> 00:49.644
and this is the human slingshot!

00:49.732 --> 00:51.524
Okay, guys, on three.

00:51.609 --> 00:54.812
One, two, three.

01:00.910 --> 01:02.073
- Chuck?
- Chuck!

01:02.412 --> 01:03.787
Oh, my God.

01:05.581 --> 01:06.661
Chuck!

01:06.749 --> 01:09.121
Hey, Chuck, man, are you all right?

01:09.502 --> 01:10.961
Dude, are you hurt?

01:11.045 --> 01:12.160
Dude.

01:12.380 --> 01:16.164
That was awesome.

02:15.785 --> 02:19.119
Odd coincidence
how nature and circumstance

02:19.205 --> 02:22.574
have conspired to place you
in this position, my friend.

02:22.667 --> 02:27.625
Though I imagine the irony
isn't of much interest to you now.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.291
What do you see, Duck?

02:31.384 --> 02:33.957
Some blood and tissue residue
on the stump,

02:34.053 --> 02:38.680
although not nearly enough for this to be
the impaling instrument of his demise.

02:38.766 --> 02:41.055
He had that hole in him
before he landed there?

02:41.144 --> 02:42.519
Precisely.

02:42.603 --> 02:45.474
Guess plain old ring-toss
doesn't cut it for some people.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.142
What put the hole in him?

02:47.233 --> 02:49.605
Well, it's approximately eight inches
in diameter,

02:49.694 --> 02:51.153
metallic shrapnel residue,

02:51.237 --> 02:54.820
organ and tissue damage
consistent with a high-velocity object.

02:54.907 --> 02:56.947
I've only seen this one time before.

02:57.035 --> 03:00.486
In a Somali village called M'butatu.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.952
A young sheepherder made the mistake

03:03.041 --> 03:05.828
of impregnating the daughters
of a local warlord.

03:05.918 --> 03:08.077
And they cored him out like an apple?

03:08.171 --> 03:09.285
I can assure you, Tony,

03:09.380 --> 03:12.215
they take such things
very seriously in Somalia.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.835
- What'd they do?
- Good old-fashioned Soviet technology.

03:15.928 --> 03:18.550
A shoulder-fired
anti-tank missile at 20 paces.

03:18.639 --> 03:21.012
It's what they use to shoot
our helicopters down in Iraq.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.786
Red-white-and-blue version's
called a S.M.A.W.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.803
Shoulder-launched
multi-purpose assault weapon.

03:24.896 --> 03:27.351
The safety backblast
on that weapon is 100 metres.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.224
Yeah.

03:31.319 --> 03:33.276
Yeah, they fired
from right in here some place.

03:33.363 --> 03:34.394
He was there.

03:34.489 --> 03:36.647
The warhead damage
should be somewhere on this line.

03:36.741 --> 03:37.856
On it.

03:38.826 --> 03:40.618
What are you looking for?

03:42.080 --> 03:43.278
This.

03:43.623 --> 03:46.328
- What is it?
- Igniter cap.

03:46.417 --> 03:49.751
When the S.M.A.W. Is fired,
this is ejected out the back.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.048
Get some scrapings off the tree
for Abby.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.421
Duck, what are you estimating
on time of death?

03:56.511 --> 03:57.886
You know, that's tricky, Jethro.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.544
Given the massive
and rapid loss of blood

04:00.640 --> 04:02.514
the body temp, lividity and rigour

04:02.600 --> 04:05.221
aren't gonna be much use
in establishing PMI.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.722
Yeah, but?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.355
What makes you think there's a "but"?

04:08.439 --> 04:09.850
Well, with you, there always is.

04:09.941 --> 04:11.980
Yes, that's right, isn't it?

04:12.068 --> 04:15.686
Yeah, well, as they say
in the high country markets of Sri Lanka

04:15.780 --> 04:18.531
there's more than one way
to skin a mongoose.

04:18.866 --> 04:21.322
- Actually, there are three.
- Ducky.

04:23.871 --> 04:25.116
After death,

04:25.206 --> 04:29.334
the red blood cells in the eyes
break down, forming potassium.

04:29.627 --> 04:32.877
Now, this cloudiness
is a by-product of that.

04:33.714 --> 04:36.834
Yes, I'll be able to get
an accurate determination

04:36.926 --> 04:38.753
when I test it in the lab.

04:38.845 --> 04:42.214
Best I can do for now: Past 24 hours.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.093
Got something.

04:47.061 --> 04:49.433
HEDP. Residue should confirm.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.895
- Take samples and measurements.
- Yep.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.265
Subtitles?

04:54.360 --> 04:56.851
The S.M.A.W. Fires
two types of warheads.

04:56.946 --> 04:59.069
HEDP, "High-explosive dual purpose,"

04:59.157 --> 05:01.826
and HEAA,
"High explosive anti-armour."

05:01.909 --> 05:03.617
DP leaves a crater.

05:03.703 --> 05:04.983
AA leaves a hole.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.413
Wow, you really do keep something
besides comic books in your bathroom.

05:08.499 --> 05:11.037
- Hard to believe, huh?
- Impressive.

05:11.127 --> 05:12.586
Thanks a lot.

05:13.254 --> 05:15.543
I was talking about the crater.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.968
Note the signs of haematoma
on the victim's face and upper torso.

05:20.052 --> 05:23.421
Signs of haematoma
on the victim's face and upper torso.

05:23.514 --> 05:25.590
He was beaten
before he was murdered.

05:25.683 --> 05:27.806
He was beaten
before he was murdered.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.515
- Well before.
- Well before.

05:34.859 --> 05:35.938
It's bothering you?

05:36.027 --> 05:38.227
I was going to suggest
you leave the recorder next to me

05:38.279 --> 05:41.233
that way you don't have
to repeat everything I say.

05:41.324 --> 05:42.948
Good plan, Doctor.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.946
Yes. Note the variations
in colour of the bruises.

05:47.038 --> 05:49.529
These were inflicted
on several different occasions

05:49.624 --> 05:51.616
within the past three to four weeks.

05:51.709 --> 05:54.330
Additionally, the bruising
is not only uniform

05:54.420 --> 05:58.085
but there are no indications
of any points of acute trauma

05:59.342 --> 06:04.004
such as would have occurred
from the contact of bare knuckles

06:04.096 --> 06:06.587
on unprotected skin.

06:07.016 --> 06:10.136
I believe further examination will reveal

06:10.228 --> 06:12.849
that our victim was a student
of the "sweet science."

06:12.939 --> 06:14.433
"Sweet science"?

06:14.524 --> 06:16.730
A pugilist, if you will.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.020
- He was a boxer?
- Precisely.

06:21.072 --> 06:23.397
- Do you want to get that?
- Can I?

06:26.118 --> 06:27.316
Mom?

06:27.411 --> 06:28.609
Please.

06:38.005 --> 06:41.042
- McGee! Are you nuts?
- What?

06:41.259 --> 06:43.132
You're at Gibbs' desk
touching his computer.

06:43.219 --> 06:45.924
That's like touching
the Ark of the Covenant.

06:46.013 --> 06:47.128
Gibbs knows I'm doing this.

06:47.223 --> 06:49.346
He said you could use his computer?

06:49.433 --> 06:50.631
Really?

06:50.726 --> 06:53.217
You know, when mine fried
he wouldn't let me touch his.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.598
Because your fingers are always greasy
from fried chicken and pizza.

06:56.691 --> 06:59.016
- How's it going?
- Bringing it online now, boss.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.189
What?

07:00.278 --> 07:02.484
Yearbook photos
from every British university

07:02.572 --> 07:04.897
taken between '87 and '97.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.197
- Who said our terrorist was British?
- Ducky.

07:07.285 --> 07:09.888
Thought his syntax suggested
higher education in the British Isles.

07:09.912 --> 07:13.364
Well, maybe he just grew up watching
tons of Cary Grant movies.

07:15.459 --> 07:18.994
Okay, why the decade
between '87 and '97?

07:19.130 --> 07:21.169
Because I estimated his age to be 33,

07:21.257 --> 07:23.830
and added five years on either side
for safety.

07:24.594 --> 07:26.136
Did you spend college summers

07:26.220 --> 07:28.260
working at a carnie
as "Madam Natasha"?

07:29.307 --> 07:31.050
I've always been good at guessing ages.

07:31.142 --> 07:33.300
Yeah? How old am I?

07:34.437 --> 07:36.394
Based on chronology or maturity?

07:36.480 --> 07:38.687
That was very funny.
Come on. How old?

07:38.774 --> 07:40.019
Thirty-two.

07:40.109 --> 07:41.817
- You saw my file.
- Nope.

07:42.486 --> 07:43.731
Well, how old is Gibbs?

07:43.821 --> 07:46.988
- Okay, we're online and ready to go.
- That's great work, McGee.

07:47.158 --> 07:48.320
Anytime, boss.

07:48.409 --> 07:49.440
Look at that.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.658
He gets a pat on the back,
I get a smack on the head.

07:51.746 --> 07:54.118
- Oh, it doesn't seem fair, does it?
- No.

07:54.206 --> 07:57.243
But it is. Fax from AFIS came in.

07:57.335 --> 08:00.122
Our victim is
Staff Sergeant Thomas Grimm.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.624
He was an armourer attached

08:01.714 --> 08:04.466
to the Ordnance Maintenance Centre
at Quantico.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.006
Responsible for weapons inventory
and custody cards.

08:07.094 --> 08:08.802
Makes sense, given the way he died.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.715
And Ducky was right. He was a boxer.

08:10.806 --> 08:13.132
Top-rated middleweight
on the Quantico boxing team.

08:15.519 --> 08:17.393
Staff Sergeant Grimm
was a hell of a fighter

08:17.480 --> 08:18.559
and a great Marine.

08:18.648 --> 08:20.272
Hey, hands up, Marino!

08:20.858 --> 08:23.183
I saw Grimm's record. Very impressive.

08:23.277 --> 08:25.021
17-0 since he joined the corps.

08:25.112 --> 08:26.607
Every last one was a battle.

08:26.697 --> 08:29.217
All right, if you two are going to dance,
you join the Air Force!

08:29.241 --> 08:31.199
Now let's see some action in there!

08:31.285 --> 08:33.990
Do you have a list
of Grimm's opponents?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.701
You think his death
had something to do with his boxing?

08:36.791 --> 08:38.700
Everything's on the table
until we rule it out.

08:38.793 --> 08:40.417
I've got a list in my office.

08:41.796 --> 08:43.337
I'll wait here.

08:51.263 --> 08:54.181
- Where'd you learn how to box?
- Five older brothers.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.428
Self-preservation.

08:58.521 --> 09:01.391
- You here about Staff Sergeant Grimm?
- I am.

09:03.567 --> 09:06.272
Special Agent Todd, NCIS.

09:07.571 --> 09:09.363
- You are?
- Corporal McClain.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.153
- Any idea what happened?
- We're working on it.

09:12.243 --> 09:13.405
Did you know him?

09:13.494 --> 09:15.403
Mostly from seeing him around the gym.

09:16.414 --> 09:18.739
- Good guy?
- From what I could tell, you know.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.500
He was a good boxer.

09:20.584 --> 09:22.162
Killer left hook.

09:26.674 --> 09:29.212
Look, if it's okay with you,
I really gotta...

09:29.301 --> 09:30.677
No problem.

09:47.069 --> 09:49.904
- Looks like a serial number.
- It's part of one.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.483
The good part?

09:51.615 --> 09:54.949
You can't go straight for dessert, Gibbs.
You have to eat your peas first.

09:55.035 --> 09:56.411
I hate peas.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.117
The serial number
indicates the manufacturer,

09:59.206 --> 10:01.413
the lot number
and the year that it was built.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.252
We only have a partial,
so we only have part of the picture.

10:04.336 --> 10:05.795
The good part?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.706
It's ice cream time.

10:07.798 --> 10:09.755
The weapon that killed
Staff Sergeant Grimm

10:09.842 --> 10:12.298
definitely came
from the armoury at Quantico.

10:21.896 --> 10:23.853
Staff Sergeant Grimm
could've used a little help

10:23.939 --> 10:25.599
from the boys on Queer Eye.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.396
I doubt that rug
would have made the cut.

10:28.611 --> 10:31.280
Actually, this was the only thing
I kind of liked.

10:31.864 --> 10:36.111
I'll add that to the list of reasons
I never want to see your apartment.

10:56.388 --> 10:58.595
Nothing in the bedroom.
What's with the computer?

10:58.682 --> 11:00.805
No desktop, no operating system.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.304
Maybe it's busted.

11:02.394 --> 11:05.312
Or maybe somebody
reformatted the hard drive.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.775
"We can rebuild it."

11:08.859 --> 11:10.852
"We have the technology."

11:11.654 --> 11:14.773
Hello? Steve Austin?
The Six Million Dollar Man?

11:15.324 --> 11:17.084
See, that's the problem
with the world today.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.784
No respect for history.

11:18.869 --> 11:20.992
Can we just concentrate
on the present?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.455
Kate was right.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.781
The hard drive
was completely reformatted.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.627
- So we have nothing.
- Actually, no.

11:28.003 --> 11:29.961
When you write data onto a hard drive,

11:30.047 --> 11:31.956
it's triggered electronically
and magnetically

11:32.049 --> 11:33.627
onto a hard drive plate.

11:33.717 --> 11:36.469
What would that mean
as something Kate would understand?

11:36.679 --> 11:38.588
That even though
the drive was reformatted

11:38.681 --> 11:41.088
all the information it contained
is still here.

11:41.183 --> 11:43.259
It's just a matter
of Humpty-Dumptying it.

11:43.352 --> 11:45.808
I thought they couldn't put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

11:45.896 --> 11:48.683
That's because the king
only had horses and men.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.151
I ran the data through the computer

11:52.236 --> 11:54.561
and was able to construct
a virtual hard drive

11:54.655 --> 11:57.276
containing the information
from Staff Sergeant Grimm's computer.

11:57.366 --> 12:00.320
- You got everything back?
- Since the day he bought it.

12:00.411 --> 12:02.534
Hey, let's start
with the most recent stuff.

12:02.621 --> 12:07.330
Okay, the last file Grimm edited
was a jpeg.

12:11.922 --> 12:14.674
Whoa, a lot of firepower.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.754
It isn't exactly
standard armoury floor covering.

12:17.845 --> 12:20.418
It's not. That's Grimm's living room.

12:30.632 --> 12:33.040
Ran the LUDs
on Staff Sergeant Grimm's phone.

12:33.135 --> 12:34.415
The day before he was killed,

12:34.511 --> 12:37.084
he placed seven calls
to Abe's Pawn Shop.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.888
None of them lasting
more than a minute.

12:38.974 --> 12:40.433
- Setting up the meet?
- Could be.

12:40.517 --> 12:41.680
Pawnshop's local.

12:41.768 --> 12:44.686
LEO said that the previous owner,
an Abe Hargrove

12:44.771 --> 12:47.060
is currently doing 3 to 5
at the FCI in Butner

12:47.149 --> 12:48.524
for interstate trafficking.

12:48.608 --> 12:49.984
Daughter's running it now.

12:50.068 --> 12:53.402
Well, maybe the daughter
is following in Daddy's footsteps.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.817
Undercover time?

12:55.198 --> 12:56.361
For me.

12:56.450 --> 12:59.237
- Not a good idea, boss.
- Yeah? Why is that, DiNozzo?

13:00.037 --> 13:02.807
You're thinking renegade enlisted
bearing gifts straight from the source?

13:02.831 --> 13:03.946
I was.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.144
We don't know the daughter's
involvement with Grimm, yet.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.208
Approaching her this soon
as another Marine gone bad

13:08.253 --> 13:09.498
might make her suspicious.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.209
Which brings me, actually,
to another option.

13:12.299 --> 13:14.837
Complete and total sleaze.
Pure pawnshop material.

13:14.926 --> 13:17.155
And let's face it, I'm a more
believable scumbag than you.

13:17.179 --> 13:18.210
No argument here.

13:18.305 --> 13:21.259
Me, dishevelled. You, high and tight.
Me, flaky. You, solid citizen.

13:21.350 --> 13:23.176
Yeah, yeah, I, I get the point.

13:23.393 --> 13:25.516
Have Abby do a full background and ID.

13:26.063 --> 13:27.142
Sure.

13:27.814 --> 13:28.929
What?

13:29.399 --> 13:32.234
- For you?
- For you, DiNozzo. For you.

13:32.319 --> 13:33.564
Right. Yeah!

13:33.862 --> 13:35.404
Kate, what'd you get

13:35.489 --> 13:37.280
from Staff Sergeant Grimm's CO
at Quantico?

13:37.366 --> 13:40.817
Well, part of Staff Sergeant Grimm's job
was to evaluate weapons.

13:40.911 --> 13:41.951
If they were beyond repair

13:42.037 --> 13:43.890
then he would transport them
to a facility to be destroyed.

13:43.914 --> 13:46.059
But once they were out of Quantico,
they were out of the system.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.197
Out of the Quantico system.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.228
They still have to be signed into
wherever they were going.

13:49.252 --> 13:51.790
Well, these are Staff Sergeant Grimm's
SRB and duty records.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.798
- I'll go through everything.
- Yeah, you will.

13:58.136 --> 13:59.761
You know, Gibbs,

14:00.514 --> 14:03.087
I know that you're bothered
that the terrorist got away.

14:03.183 --> 14:04.642
I am, too. But...

14:06.895 --> 14:08.520
But you might want to think about,

14:08.605 --> 14:11.891
you know, trying to be a little bit less
of a gloomy Gus.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.355
"Gloomy Gus"?

14:16.196 --> 14:17.607
I love Gus!

14:18.824 --> 14:21.741
It's very strong.
What do you have to go with it?

14:22.953 --> 14:24.032
Louie?

14:24.621 --> 14:26.246
"Gus Louie."

14:26.915 --> 14:29.406
- Sort of sounds like a salad.
- Yeah.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.753
- How about Bricker?
- Bricker.

14:33.713 --> 14:35.208
"Gus Bricker."

14:36.341 --> 14:37.670
That's tough.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.001
Gibbs says put some military
in the background.

14:41.346 --> 14:43.754
Dishonourable discharge, of course.

14:44.433 --> 14:47.433
- How about some time in Leavenworth?
- What's the crime?

14:47.519 --> 14:49.808
Something that fits my persona.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.857
How about violation
of federal obscenity laws?

14:54.443 --> 14:58.143
That's funny. No, I meant
my new sleazy gun-running profile.

14:58.238 --> 15:01.192
- Drugs are always a safe bet.
- Yeah, drugs.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.655
You got 3 to 5 for possession.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.744
Out on parole in two.

15:05.829 --> 15:08.154
There is no justice in this world, Abs.

15:29.186 --> 15:31.511
Come on, lady! That's not fair.

15:31.813 --> 15:33.391
Life's not fair.

15:33.690 --> 15:34.853
Sucks.

15:35.525 --> 15:36.688
Sucks.

15:37.694 --> 15:39.485
All right, whatever.

15:45.785 --> 15:47.030
See you.

15:47.954 --> 15:49.947
You drive a hard bargain.

15:50.207 --> 15:51.535
Not really.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.285
Stuff's probably not worth
much more than I paid for it.

15:57.088 --> 15:59.710
- Looking for Abe.
- Not here.

15:59.799 --> 16:02.884
- When do you expect him back?
- Anywhere from 3 to 5.

16:03.678 --> 16:06.549
- Busted?
- Yep. Life's not fair.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.216
All right. Damn.

16:10.227 --> 16:12.018
You a friend of my father's?

16:12.103 --> 16:14.096
More like a business acquaintance.

16:14.731 --> 16:17.685
Well, maybe we can be
business acquaintances.

16:18.235 --> 16:20.441
Thanks, but I got other buyers.

16:20.529 --> 16:23.233
Whatever my father paid, I'll better it.

16:24.699 --> 16:26.443
And why would you do that?

16:26.535 --> 16:29.370
To prove to guys like you
that I'm serious.

16:29.454 --> 16:31.197
Abe paid top dollar.

16:31.915 --> 16:34.951
Why don't you bring me what you've got,
and then we'll talk price.

16:35.043 --> 16:36.703
It's already here.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.516
Two cases of M-16s,

16:53.562 --> 16:55.305
and a case of LAWs.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.525
Where'd you get this stuff?

16:59.609 --> 17:02.279
- You want them or not?
- I might be interested.

17:02.362 --> 17:05.482
It's not every day you get a chance
to buy these kinds of weapons.

17:16.251 --> 17:18.327
- What's that?
- It's called scanning fingerprints.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.329
I need to know
if you are who you say you are.

17:20.422 --> 17:21.750
Forget it.

17:25.594 --> 17:27.088
Not an option.

17:40.525 --> 17:43.396
Abby, I'm surprised.

17:43.778 --> 17:46.234
I had you pegged
for more the anarchist type.

17:46.323 --> 17:49.074
Actually, I used to be an anarchist.

17:49.159 --> 17:51.282
- What happened?
- Too many rules.

17:52.203 --> 17:55.204
No, I'm just trying to help Tony
narrow down possible buyers

17:55.290 --> 17:57.828
for Staff Sergeant Grimm's
Guns "R" Us operation.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.293
I'd have thought of gangs.

17:59.377 --> 18:01.337
Well, you would have been right
up to the point of

18:01.379 --> 18:03.455
shoulder-fired anti-tank
and aircraft weapons.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.956
It's overkill for even the local Crip set.

18:06.051 --> 18:07.509
Terrorists came to my mind first

18:07.594 --> 18:09.883
but they wouldn't risk
a US military connection.

18:09.971 --> 18:11.465
There's too many outsiders.

18:11.556 --> 18:14.640
These guys, however,
are all about the military.

18:15.477 --> 18:18.810
Did you know that militias
were once a legitimate

18:18.897 --> 18:22.313
and necessary source of defence
for this country?

18:22.400 --> 18:24.393
Well, according to these guys,
they still are.

18:24.486 --> 18:26.672
I mean, it's not like they have
any new ideas, you know?

18:26.696 --> 18:29.187
- It's all so...
- The Song Remains the Same?

18:29.282 --> 18:30.480
Exactly.

18:30.992 --> 18:34.278
And bonus points
for the gratuitous rock reference.

18:40.835 --> 18:42.460
She's got skills.

18:42.545 --> 18:45.167
Yeah, she'd have a lot more
if she'd just listen.

18:45.256 --> 18:46.419
What do you mean?

18:46.508 --> 18:50.007
Let's just say Corporal McClain
likes to be the one giving the orders.

18:53.515 --> 18:55.341
All right, using more power. That's it.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.758
Corporal McClain, I need to talk to you.

18:57.852 --> 18:59.512
I got 15 more minutes with the pads.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.146
It'll have to wait.

19:02.232 --> 19:03.690
Okay. Thanks.

19:08.655 --> 19:10.529
What can I do for you?

19:10.824 --> 19:13.315
- Tell me why you lied to me.
- I didn't.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.161
You gave me the impression that
you barely knew Staff Sergeant Grimm.

19:16.246 --> 19:18.997
Look, I said what I said.
You drew your own conclusions.

19:19.082 --> 19:21.655
- Do you think this is a game, Corporal?
- No.

19:21.751 --> 19:23.459
Three days ago, you and Grimm

19:23.545 --> 19:25.870
took a shipment of weapons
from Quantico to be destroyed.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.078
That's right.

19:27.173 --> 19:29.054
Yeah, well, one of those weapons
didn't make it.

19:29.092 --> 19:31.797
- I want to know what happened.
- I don't know.

19:32.679 --> 19:34.718
Is that your final answer?

19:36.307 --> 19:38.596
- Turn around.
- Wait. Wait.

19:38.685 --> 19:40.808
I don't know, okay? Really.

19:40.895 --> 19:42.354
Can we just...

19:44.691 --> 19:46.268
You're on the log.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.194
You signed the shipment out
at 1400 hours on the sixth.

19:49.279 --> 19:51.604
I was there. I just... I wasn't.

19:51.698 --> 19:53.618
Grimm and I picked the weapons up
at the armoury,

19:53.700 --> 19:56.025
but he dropped me off
as soon as we got off base.

19:56.119 --> 19:58.692
- He dropped you off?
- My boyfriend. He's Army.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.366
Third division out of Fort Bragg.

20:00.457 --> 20:02.698
He was shipping out for Iraq
the next day.

20:03.418 --> 20:05.245
Look, this was Grimm's idea.

20:05.336 --> 20:07.744
He said it didn't take two people
to drive a truck.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.128
He told me he could handle it himself.

20:11.634 --> 20:13.212
What about you?

20:13.428 --> 20:14.922
What about me?

20:15.597 --> 20:17.755
How do I know you're not a cop?

20:18.016 --> 20:19.296
You don't.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.723
But if I was, don't you think

20:21.811 --> 20:24.219
that's something you would have
wanted to ask a while ago?

20:26.691 --> 20:29.396
Are you always this subtle
when you're leering at women?

20:29.486 --> 20:32.356
Leering, by definition,
isn't supposed to be subtle.

20:32.906 --> 20:34.364
Do you always move this fast?

20:34.449 --> 20:36.738
Only when there's nothing
to slow me down.

20:48.087 --> 20:52.085
Gus Bricker. Born 8 July, 1972.

20:52.175 --> 20:55.092
Enlisted in the Marine Corps, 1993.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.630
Dishonourable discharge.

20:58.556 --> 21:00.596
3 to 5 years in Leavenworth

21:00.683 --> 21:03.221
for possession of methamphetamines
six months later.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.814
I have authority issues.

21:10.276 --> 21:12.981
3 to 5 for a first offence on possession?

21:13.071 --> 21:14.446
Seems a little steep.

21:14.864 --> 21:16.987
The Corps has higher standards.

21:20.745 --> 21:22.239
They took you.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.074
I like playing games with you.

21:30.630 --> 21:32.338
Just not this kind.

21:33.508 --> 21:37.043
So, are we gonna do this, or what?

21:44.936 --> 21:46.679
I'll get your money.

22:06.541 --> 22:07.821
NCIS.

22:08.209 --> 22:09.490
ATF.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.870
Drop it.

22:18.294 --> 22:20.583
- You drop it.
- You're outnumbered.

22:22.131 --> 22:24.456
- I can still kill him.
- Go ahead.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.130
Easy.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.599
- Search her.
- Boss.

22:42.568 --> 22:43.766
Got it?

22:48.491 --> 22:52.489
- Very thorough, Special Agent...
- Tony DiNozzo.

22:53.204 --> 22:56.158
Well, you can't be too careful,
Special Agent...

22:56.582 --> 22:59.156
Melinda Stone. ID's under the stereo.

23:01.003 --> 23:03.673
You weren't seriously
going to let her shoot me, were you?

23:03.756 --> 23:04.835
No.

23:06.759 --> 23:08.633
You had a plan, right?

23:09.137 --> 23:10.216
Yeah.

23:13.015 --> 23:14.759
It's the real deal.

23:17.103 --> 23:19.179
Tell me about this op you're running.

23:19.272 --> 23:22.023
ATF knew they were moving
a lot of illegal weapons.

23:22.108 --> 23:24.294
We figured we'd leave it open,
see what crawled through.

23:24.318 --> 23:26.691
Put me in as Abe Hargrove's daughter.

23:26.779 --> 23:29.531
- Where's your backup?
- You're looking at it.

23:29.615 --> 23:32.949
We're stretched as thin
as everybody else since 9/11.

23:33.369 --> 23:35.741
- Tell me about Staff Sergeant Grimm.
- Who?

23:35.830 --> 23:37.704
Thomas Grimm?
Armourer at Quantico?

23:37.790 --> 23:38.869
Never heard of him.

23:38.958 --> 23:41.627
He placed seven calls here
two days ago.

23:42.503 --> 23:44.710
He said his name was Jeff Conklin

23:44.797 --> 23:47.371
and that he had access
to high-powered weapons.

23:47.466 --> 23:48.861
What were you going to do with them?

23:48.885 --> 23:51.885
Well, I was working with
one of Abe Hargrove's former buyers.

23:51.971 --> 23:53.549
- Who?
- No name.

23:54.223 --> 23:56.216
Only had a phone number and a voice.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.304
Soon as your armourer
sent me digital stills, I set up the buy.

23:59.395 --> 24:01.103
You ever see the weapons?

24:01.189 --> 24:03.395
He never showed.
I guess he got cold feet.

24:03.482 --> 24:05.392
That's not exactly how it went down.

24:05.484 --> 24:08.569
Thanks to a S.M.A.W.,
he's got cold everything now.

24:11.574 --> 24:12.737
Yes, sir.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.919
Staff Sergeant Rafael?

24:27.006 --> 24:29.212
Special Agent Todd, NCIS.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.187
Once the request
is approved from Division,

24:44.273 --> 24:46.335
all non-operative weapons
are reported to Demil Centre

24:46.359 --> 24:48.647
in Crane, Indiana, on a NAVMC 1048.

24:48.736 --> 24:50.111
Then what?

24:50.196 --> 24:52.466
The inventory is transferred here
to Camp Geiger and stored,

24:52.490 --> 24:53.949
pending orders for destruction.

24:54.033 --> 24:56.026
You contact Indiana
when you received the weapons?

24:56.118 --> 24:57.281
Yes, ma'am. It's procedure.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.097
Did you contact them
when Staff Sergeant Grimm

24:59.121 --> 25:00.366
brought his inventory here?

25:00.456 --> 25:02.532
Like I said, ma'am, it's procedure.

25:03.292 --> 25:05.451
Yes, you did, Sergeant.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.834
But I'm asking specifically
about the weapons.

25:07.922 --> 25:10.128
Grimm signed out of Quantico
three days ago.

25:10.216 --> 25:14.629
Ma'am, I am a Staff Sergeant
in the United States Marine Corps.

25:14.929 --> 25:16.471
I don't know how it is at NCIS,

25:16.555 --> 25:19.971
but I follow all orders and procedures
laid out for me under this command.

25:20.059 --> 25:22.467
You still haven't answered my question.

25:23.437 --> 25:27.649
Did you inspect
Staff Sergeant Grimm's manifest

25:27.733 --> 25:30.485
sign for the weapons,
and contact Indiana?

25:32.071 --> 25:33.150
Yes.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.397
Wasn't so hard, was it, Staff Sergeant?

25:36.492 --> 25:38.449
Will there be
any more questions, ma'am?

25:40.329 --> 25:41.408
No.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.245
Not here.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.995
I want to see you in Washington.

25:50.089 --> 25:53.292
I'll call your CO,
find out what the procedures are.

25:54.510 --> 25:55.969
I like a girl with spunk.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.679
That right?

25:58.431 --> 26:01.634
First girl I ever kissed
kicked me right in the...

26:02.643 --> 26:05.265
- Way above the shins?
- Painfully above.

26:06.522 --> 26:08.680
- I hope you learned your lesson.
- I did.

26:08.774 --> 26:12.274
Next time, I waited till after
she swallowed her gummy bear.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.319
DiNozzo! Agent Stone.

26:17.241 --> 26:20.242
You're working with us on this.
Call your office for verification.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.407
Not now.

26:21.495 --> 26:23.203
We found evidence
on Grimm's computer

26:23.289 --> 26:25.249
he was putting photos of his goods
on the Internet

26:25.291 --> 26:26.601
to see what interest he could draw.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.295
- You think my buyer found him first?
- I think it's a possibility.

26:29.378 --> 26:30.956
Cut out the middle man,
save some dough,

26:31.047 --> 26:32.707
only the deal went south somehow?

26:32.798 --> 26:34.901
Yeah, someone has still got
enough firepower out there

26:34.925 --> 26:36.336
to do some serious damage.

26:36.427 --> 26:39.132
- DiNozzo, find us some weapons to sell.
- On it.

26:39.555 --> 26:42.046
Agent Stone, with me.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.846
Go!

26:44.393 --> 26:47.478
Call your buyer.
Tell him you found a new supplier.

26:47.563 --> 26:49.888
If my boss verifies
that we're working together.

26:49.982 --> 26:51.642
This time you'll bring your supplier.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.211
He'll think you're covering your ass.

26:53.235 --> 26:55.477
- The buyer won't like it.
- No, he won't.

26:55.571 --> 26:57.979
But you're gonna give him
a background that checks out.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.734
Will Agent DiNozzo
be the supplier again?

26:59.825 --> 27:02.743
Unfortunately, Special Agent DiNozzo
doesn't fit the profile.

27:02.828 --> 27:04.868
He's more the scumbag type.

27:04.955 --> 27:06.070
Gibbs.

27:06.832 --> 27:09.667
Special Agent Todd.
Special Agent Stone. ATF.

27:09.752 --> 27:12.243
- She'll be working with us on this.
- Possibly.

27:12.755 --> 27:14.498
- Give me a minute?
- Yeah.

27:15.341 --> 27:16.372
Two things.

27:16.467 --> 27:18.756
McGee checked out
Corporal Patty McClain's alibi.

27:18.844 --> 27:20.884
Her boyfriend shipped to Iraq
just like she said.

27:20.971 --> 27:23.132
When Grimm was killed,
they were shacked up in a motel.

27:23.182 --> 27:24.380
Second thing?

27:24.475 --> 27:26.931
Staff Sergeant Rafael's holding out.
I can feel it in my gut.

27:27.019 --> 27:28.182
Guts are good.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.290
He's having a little time-out
in the interrogation room

27:30.314 --> 27:32.334
so when you're ready,
I'll go over all my notes with you.

27:32.358 --> 27:34.232
I'm gonna work up an ID with Abby.

27:34.318 --> 27:37.070
I'm afraid Staff Sergeant Rafael
is all yours.

27:37.154 --> 27:39.147
You always do the interrogations,
Gibbs.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.698
Not this one.

27:47.289 --> 27:50.789
- Abs, I need an ID.
- There's a lot of that going around.

27:52.294 --> 27:54.999
This the ATF lady
that's working with us?

27:55.089 --> 27:57.544
- News travels fast around here.
- You have no idea.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.963
Shoot.

27:59.051 --> 28:01.091
Arms dealer. Ex-military.

28:01.345 --> 28:03.551
- DD?
- Honourable discharge.

28:03.639 --> 28:05.133
Give me a medal.

28:05.224 --> 28:07.133
- Silver?
- Bronze.

28:07.268 --> 28:09.937
Silver would be better.
You're more of a winter.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.188
- Never had your colours done, did you?
- Not unless I was unconscious.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.669
Your colours are arranged seasonally
based on your skin tone.

28:15.693 --> 28:16.807
You're a winter.

28:16.902 --> 28:18.903
Bronze is more of an autumn.
It's important, Gibbs.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.102
I'm sure it is.

28:20.197 --> 28:22.902
- You scoff, but there's scientific...
- Silver'll be fine, Abs.

28:23.367 --> 28:26.368
- Wise choice. Okay, your work history.
- Civilian contractor.

28:26.620 --> 28:29.491
Nicaragua. Nepal. Greece.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.037
Kazakhstan.
That would be a good addition.

28:32.126 --> 28:33.917
Another winter thing?

28:34.336 --> 28:36.163
Don't be silly, ATF lady.

28:39.758 --> 28:42.925
Abs, leave a few gaps.
Don't make it so neat.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.126
Please, Gibbs.

28:44.221 --> 28:46.297
I've been making fake IDs
since I was 15.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.846
- What kind of name do you want?
- Anything but Gus.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.598
Are we gonna do this, ma'am?

29:00.696 --> 29:04.528
You were paired with Grimm
at the armourer's school in Aberdeen.

29:04.617 --> 29:08.151
- Is that right?
- Four months training, starting June '02.

29:08.245 --> 29:11.080
Spent 10 hours a day learning
maintenance, repair, and evaluation.

29:11.165 --> 29:13.537
Were you and Grimm close
outside of school?

29:13.626 --> 29:15.914
We had a few beers over the weekends.

29:16.003 --> 29:18.209
Along with other guys from our class.

29:18.297 --> 29:19.412
What about now?

29:19.507 --> 29:21.795
- Few beers on the weekends?
- No, ma'am.

29:21.884 --> 29:24.090
- Talk on the phone?
- No, ma'am.

29:28.849 --> 29:30.557
I'm going to need the last three months

29:30.643 --> 29:32.220
of Staff Sergeant Rafael's
phone records

29:32.311 --> 29:33.722
faxed over from Camp Geiger.

29:33.812 --> 29:35.437
- Right away.
- Thanks.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.274
We talk a little.
It doesn't make me a criminal.

29:38.484 --> 29:42.232
- What do you talk about? Sports? Girls?
- Yeah.

29:42.696 --> 29:43.776
Guns?

29:45.574 --> 29:48.575
Sometimes we talk work.
That involves weapons.

29:55.626 --> 29:58.710
We found Staff Sergeant Grimm's
body yesterday.

29:59.713 --> 30:02.631
He'd been blown apart by a weapon.
A S.M.A.W.

30:04.677 --> 30:07.132
The serial number on the S.M.A.W.
That killed him

30:07.221 --> 30:10.091
matches the inventory
on his NAVMC 1048.

30:10.683 --> 30:13.221
A copy of which you signed
and sent to Crane.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.884
Now, how can this weapon
be at Camp Geiger,

30:15.980 --> 30:17.604
but not be there?

30:18.107 --> 30:20.395
Stuff gets misplaced once in a while.

30:20.568 --> 30:24.150
- So you stand by what's on your report?
- I have no reason not to.

30:32.371 --> 30:33.913
Make your call.

30:39.461 --> 30:42.297
The buyer chose
a group of abandoned factory buildings

30:42.381 --> 30:44.374
- somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
- Smart.

30:44.466 --> 30:46.673
- They'd spot backup anywhere close.
- Yeah.

30:46.760 --> 30:50.176
Our cell phones have GPS technology.
They'll take them,

30:50.264 --> 30:53.265
and sweep us for a signal,
make sure we're not wired.

30:53.517 --> 30:55.059
So what's that?

30:55.728 --> 30:56.926
It's a locator.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.975
I won't activate it unless they move us.

31:00.399 --> 31:02.807
Very James Bond. Does it tell time, too?

31:02.901 --> 31:06.650
You can lay back
and track us from a safe distance.

31:38.395 --> 31:39.558
Yeah?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.686
- Team's in place.
- Good.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.888
Tell Gibbs not to forget

31:42.983 --> 31:45.224
it's the first two MP5s on the left
that have live clips.

31:45.277 --> 31:46.308
Tell him yourself.

31:46.403 --> 31:48.423
I already told him four times.
I think he's annoyed.

31:48.447 --> 31:50.523
It's his left when he's looking down
at the crate

31:50.616 --> 31:52.844
- with the barrels pointing...
- Away from him. He knows.

31:52.868 --> 31:55.276
Well, yeah, just... Okay, just remind him

31:55.371 --> 31:57.862
that it's the top layer
of the ammo cache that's live,

31:57.956 --> 31:59.664
- 'cause the rest is...
- Hey, DiNozzo!

31:59.750 --> 32:01.161
Get off the line.

32:01.251 --> 32:02.746
Okay. Good luck, boss.

32:11.136 --> 32:12.299
Hands!

32:17.142 --> 32:19.468
Keep them up. Check them.

32:25.651 --> 32:26.813
Clean.

32:28.070 --> 32:29.648
You got my package?

32:29.738 --> 32:32.063
- Yeah, they're right here.
- Keys.

32:35.619 --> 32:36.994
So where's our money?

32:37.079 --> 32:39.404
You'll get your money
when we test the weapons.

32:39.498 --> 32:40.613
Let's go!

32:41.166 --> 32:42.329
Move.

32:45.045 --> 32:46.919
Cell phones in the bag.

32:51.844 --> 32:54.251
Wallet, jewellery, and watches, too.

33:01.061 --> 33:03.101
We gonna get a receipt for this?

33:03.188 --> 33:04.386
Get in.

33:22.866 --> 33:25.487
Are we gonna drive to Delaware
to do this?

33:30.040 --> 33:31.997
You guys have a website?

33:32.501 --> 33:35.074
A lot of these militia groups
have websites.

33:36.213 --> 33:38.122
All kinds of links to buy merchandise.

33:38.215 --> 33:43.007
You can buy coffee cups,
sweatshirts, caps, whatever.

33:43.095 --> 33:45.586
It even has a militia-babe calendar.

33:46.765 --> 33:48.093
It's amazing.

33:52.521 --> 33:56.435
The only calendar we have
is one that marks the days

33:56.525 --> 34:00.309
till the US government takes away
our last constitutional freedom.

34:00.779 --> 34:02.606
And when that day comes

34:02.698 --> 34:04.986
and some Federal cop
puts a Glock to your head

34:05.075 --> 34:07.613
'cause he doesn't like your jokes,

34:08.786 --> 34:10.281
think about us.

34:12.331 --> 34:14.241
Thinking about you now.

34:31.143 --> 34:33.467
Here's what I think, Staff Sergeant.

34:33.562 --> 34:37.476
Your Marine buddy called you
with a proposition too good to refuse.

34:38.150 --> 34:40.853
All you had to do was sign for weapons
that were useless.

34:40.944 --> 34:42.818
They were gonna be destroyed.

34:43.321 --> 34:46.690
Didn't seem like
such a terrible thing to do, did it?

34:47.743 --> 34:49.402
You're gonna do time.

34:49.494 --> 34:52.281
How much depends
on a number of things.

34:52.371 --> 34:56.583
Including what kind of cooperation
I tell the JAG prosecutors you gave me.

35:07.429 --> 35:09.552
I wonder, if this were you,

35:10.015 --> 35:14.392
how you'd appreciate another Marine
not speaking up to get your killer.

35:19.566 --> 35:23.065
I'll be back to read your charges
and your Article 31 rights.

35:24.071 --> 35:26.193
I never thought anyone would get hurt.

35:31.036 --> 35:34.286
It was only going to be one time.
We were never going to do it again.

35:34.372 --> 35:36.164
Grimm approached you?

35:37.167 --> 35:38.910
We met at a bar,

35:40.212 --> 35:42.500
and it seemed pretty foolproof.

35:44.424 --> 35:47.876
All I had to do was sign weapons in
and make some cash.

35:50.013 --> 35:52.171
It was a good deal for both of you.

35:52.849 --> 35:55.684
- It was a good deal for all three of us.
- Three?

35:56.978 --> 35:58.223
McGee.

35:58.563 --> 36:01.813
Kate, I realised that I'd overlooked
something in the search programme.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.560
Late transfers to school systems...

36:03.652 --> 36:05.775
Tell me how you checked
Corporal McClain's alibi.

36:05.862 --> 36:08.982
I called Army CID to verify her boyfriend
was shipped out to Iraq.

36:09.074 --> 36:10.533
The motel part.

36:10.617 --> 36:13.571
Corporal McClain says she spent the
night of Staff Sergeant Grimm's death

36:13.662 --> 36:16.413
at the Two Moon Motel on US 1
with her boyfriend.

36:16.498 --> 36:18.905
- You went?
- Well, I called.

36:19.334 --> 36:21.576
That wasn't right.
I should have gone in person.

36:21.670 --> 36:24.421
McGee, can you put your insecurities
on hold for just a few seconds?

36:24.506 --> 36:26.214
- I can.
- What did the clerk say?

36:26.299 --> 36:29.051
Corporal Thomas McKenzie
signed for a room at 1900

36:29.136 --> 36:31.377
with a woman who matched
Corporal McClain's description.

36:31.471 --> 36:32.634
You faxed him a photo?

36:32.722 --> 36:34.492
Well, I hadn't received it
from Quantico, yet.

36:34.516 --> 36:38.099
- When you did receive it.
- I guess I got a little involved with this.

36:53.118 --> 36:54.493
Close it up!

37:00.292 --> 37:01.454
Get out!

37:11.178 --> 37:13.418
What do you say
we try not to push his buttons this time?

37:13.471 --> 37:14.716
I'll do my best.

37:14.806 --> 37:16.051
Thank you.

37:16.808 --> 37:19.643
The hotel clerk says
that the fax photo of Corporal McClain

37:19.728 --> 37:22.135
is not the woman that Army
Corporal McKenzie checked in with.

37:22.230 --> 37:24.900
No, that was Corporal McKenzie
on the sat phone in Iraq.

37:24.983 --> 37:27.308
- They broke up a month ago.
- Let's go.

37:29.571 --> 37:32.987
Will Gibbs have to know about this?

37:33.074 --> 37:35.826
McGee, I can't think
about your ass right now.

37:35.911 --> 37:37.654
I understand.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.073
What about DiNozzo?

37:41.750 --> 37:42.912
Right.

37:47.964 --> 37:49.589
I could get one of these at Wal-Mart.

37:49.674 --> 37:51.916
You don't want them, fine.
Take us back.

37:52.010 --> 37:53.670
I didn't say that.

37:55.347 --> 37:57.173
MP5 is a good weapon.

37:58.767 --> 38:01.305
But these are the single-fire model.

38:01.394 --> 38:04.064
- I was told they'd be full auto.
- They are.

38:04.147 --> 38:07.148
The trigger grips have been replaced
with the military variant.

38:07.234 --> 38:08.514
Watch him.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.713
Why do you think you're getting such
a good price on them?

38:10.737 --> 38:11.935
Drop it.

38:13.198 --> 38:14.941
I could demonstrate.

38:15.492 --> 38:17.152
We'll handle that.

38:18.954 --> 38:20.448
Suit yourself.

38:33.385 --> 38:34.879
$350 per unit.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.211
$500.

38:38.974 --> 38:40.384
$500's too rich.

38:40.475 --> 38:43.144
- I'm paying him $375.
- Pay him less.

38:48.441 --> 38:50.730
- $450.
- The art of compromise.

38:52.904 --> 38:55.063
- My M60s in there?
- Echo 3s.

38:59.494 --> 39:02.495
They don't make
a single-shot version of this.

39:03.540 --> 39:06.457
- Price?
- $1,000, per.

39:06.668 --> 39:09.337
Good price.
What if I wanted something heavier?

39:09.421 --> 39:10.915
How heavy you talking about?

39:11.006 --> 39:14.754
Armour-piercing ammo,
heavy calibre machine guns, rockets.

39:14.843 --> 39:16.835
Let me see what I can do.

39:18.305 --> 39:21.804
Let's take this for a little test drive
then we'll do our deal.

39:21.891 --> 39:24.643
- I didn't bring any ammo.
- Not a problem.

39:24.728 --> 39:26.388
- Yes, sir.
- We did.

39:26.855 --> 39:30.354
You'd be surprised how much
we have in common with the boy scouts.

39:43.997 --> 39:46.239
- Get me another one.
- Yes, sir.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.718
No firing pins.

40:01.514 --> 40:02.759
No firing pins!

40:02.849 --> 40:05.933
Look, I know you're pissed, okay?
I'm pissed, too!

40:06.311 --> 40:08.980
Wait! My supplier ripped me off!

40:09.064 --> 40:11.637
- You didn't know?
- No, I did not know.

40:11.733 --> 40:15.066
Just pay me for the MP5s
and let's call it a night.

40:15.153 --> 40:18.487
Considering the circumstances,
let's lower the price.

40:19.157 --> 40:20.984
$50 a unit, all right?

40:22.035 --> 40:23.577
How about free?

40:32.337 --> 40:35.124
- You tried to screw me.
- No. No. He did.

40:35.465 --> 40:37.588
I can get you the weapons you need.

40:37.842 --> 40:40.084
I want them now.

40:51.398 --> 40:52.940
I have a buyer.

40:53.858 --> 40:55.436
But we have to do it tonight.

41:12.627 --> 41:15.747
I bet it was a lot easier when
Staff Sergeant Grimm was helping.

41:17.632 --> 41:21.167
They say when you're about to die,
your life flashes before you.

41:21.261 --> 41:24.178
Is it the same when you're being
arrested for murder, Corporal?

41:24.264 --> 41:26.719
- What murder?
- Cuff her, McGee.

41:36.359 --> 41:39.313
- They'll be here.
- I hope so, for your sake.

41:46.035 --> 41:47.115
Yeah.

41:48.329 --> 41:49.492
Great.

41:55.795 --> 41:59.129
Time for NCIS to stop
laying down on the job.

42:03.553 --> 42:06.589
I learned everything I know from ATF.

42:08.224 --> 42:10.513
Special Agent Todd just informed me.

42:10.602 --> 42:13.721
Corporal Patty McClain
and the weapons are in custody.

42:13.813 --> 42:16.138
- Okay, cuff her.
- Agent Stone.

42:16.399 --> 42:17.941
Agent DiNozzo.

42:20.945 --> 42:22.854
Didn't see this coming.

42:22.947 --> 42:24.358
That was kind of the plan.

42:24.449 --> 42:26.774
We've been watching you
since your last op.

42:26.868 --> 42:28.907
Too many things didn't add up.

42:28.995 --> 42:30.716
You killed Staff Sergeant Grimm,
didn't you?

42:30.747 --> 42:32.407
No. Corporal McClain did.

42:32.499 --> 42:35.250
They got in an argument over his cut,
and she blew him away.

42:35.335 --> 42:38.289
What do you want to bet
she's going to say the same thing?

42:40.465 --> 42:43.632
It doesn't really matter.
I'm screwed either way.

42:47.931 --> 42:49.425
I really liked her.

42:49.516 --> 42:52.801
ATF agent involved
in illegal weapons and murder.

42:53.436 --> 42:56.271
- What's not to like?
- So quick to judge, Kate.

42:57.398 --> 43:00.850
Sure, she has flaws.
Sure, she's going to prison.

43:00.944 --> 43:04.728
But my instincts told me
she had good qualities, as well.

43:04.822 --> 43:08.238
Two of them wouldn't happen
to live under her shirt, would they?

43:08.535 --> 43:12.579
You're not going to believe this,
but, when it comes to women

43:12.664 --> 43:17.160
I actually look for more
complex things under the surface.

43:17.252 --> 43:19.328
- Really?
- Really.

43:19.420 --> 43:22.587
Like when you were tonguing
that he-she a week ago?

43:22.674 --> 43:25.343
Lots of complex things
under that surface.

43:26.678 --> 43:28.088
I gotta go.

43:35.937 --> 43:37.976
What's wrong with DiNozzo?

43:38.356 --> 43:39.981
He's conflicted.
