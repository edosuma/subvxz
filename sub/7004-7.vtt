WEBVTT

00:07.439 --> 00:10.675
Man, this ice cream
really is frozen.

00:10.676 --> 00:14.245
How long is it gonna take
before we get to eat it?

00:14.246 --> 00:18.016
Well, I'm guessing
about 12 more spoons.

00:19.318 --> 00:22.954
Tim, I found
the video camera.

00:22.955 --> 00:25.023
<i>(tim)</i> what do you
want that for?

00:25.024 --> 00:27.025
I want you
to tape my speech.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.360
Don't worry, mom.
You're gonna do great.
Oh, thank you.

00:29.361 --> 00:31.096
I'm so nervous about
this library opening.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.965
I have never spoken in front
of so many people before.

00:33.966 --> 00:36.567
Oh, you have nothing
to worry about.

00:36.568 --> 00:38.069
And, by the way,

00:38.070 --> 00:41.840
Did we mention
that you look awesome?

00:41.841 --> 00:44.909
Why do you have your hands
behind your backs?

00:44.910 --> 00:48.379
Just a little change of pace
from keeping 'em in front,
you know.

00:50.082 --> 00:53.752
Uh, yeah. You oughta try it.
It's a lot of fun.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.053
Let's see 'em.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.789
Both of 'em.
You're so pathetic.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.025
Oh, guys.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.695
How many times - I told you
not to break the spoons
in the ice cream.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.664
What happened to that
ice cream scooper
I bought you?

01:05.665 --> 01:09.100
It didn't work right.
Dad's trying to fix it.

01:09.101 --> 01:12.370
Dad did fix it.
Oh, great.

01:14.306 --> 01:17.375
I took the old 35-watt element
out of this and replaced it

01:17.376 --> 01:19.410
With one out of
an electric curling iron.

01:19.411 --> 01:22.180
Tim, we don't have time
for this. We have to go.

01:22.181 --> 01:24.182
Now you not only
melt the ice cream,

01:24.183 --> 01:26.217
You can style
at the same time.

01:26.218 --> 01:27.719
Just flip her on.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.155
<i>(scoop humming)</i>

01:30.156 --> 01:33.158
Watch this baby go
right through this stuff.
Look at that.

01:40.933 --> 01:44.435
Hey. Milkshake, anybody?

02:38.490 --> 02:40.524
Whoa, al.

02:40.525 --> 02:43.361
Cut me in for half
and I won't tell harry.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.334
I'm not robbing the store.

02:50.335 --> 02:52.536
Haven't you heard?
I'm part owner.

02:52.537 --> 02:54.672
Yeah, a very small part.

02:54.673 --> 02:58.342
You see that corner over there?
That's what you own.

02:58.343 --> 03:00.145
Eddie, how you doing?

03:00.146 --> 03:02.147
I'm fine, harry.
How are you?

03:02.148 --> 03:06.151
It's great that we feel
comfortable enough
to joke with each other.

03:06.152 --> 03:09.120
Right, froggy voice?

03:09.121 --> 03:13.758
Right, al.
<i>(imitates harry)</i>
right, harry.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.593
Hey, guys.
Hey, tim.
How's it going?

03:15.594 --> 03:17.328
Hi, tim.

03:17.329 --> 03:19.764
Harry, you got one of those
small screwdriver sets?

03:19.765 --> 03:21.766
Tape's jammed in my camera.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.535
Well, uh, here you go.
Hey, thanks.

03:24.536 --> 03:26.337
How's it going?
I'm numb.

03:26.338 --> 03:29.340
I just spent three of the most
boring hours of my life
at the library.

03:29.341 --> 03:31.042
Three hours?

03:31.043 --> 03:33.878
I think if you
put together all the time

03:33.879 --> 03:35.880
I've ever spent
in a library,

03:35.881 --> 03:38.349
It wouldn't come out
to be three hours.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.785
God, who would have guessed?

03:40.786 --> 03:42.787
Jill had this big speech
at the library.

03:42.788 --> 03:44.789
I told her
I'd tape it for her.

03:44.790 --> 03:48.193
You taped that?
Great, 'cause ilene
really wanted to see it.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.094
Is she the orthodontist
you been seeing?

03:50.095 --> 03:51.796
That she is.

03:51.797 --> 03:55.233
Maybe one night this week,
ilene and I could come
and watch jill's speech.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.769
We'll show you
the tape of ilene speaking
at the wisdom tooth symposium.

04:00.339 --> 04:03.942
Or I could just put my head
in a vise.

04:03.943 --> 04:08.847
Timmy, are those things
hard to use?
No, not anymore.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.949
Point and shoot, pretty much.

04:10.950 --> 04:14.285
Put her on "auto."
push your lens cap aside.
You start shooting.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.855
Why does everybody wave
at these things?

04:19.325 --> 04:22.827
It's perfect. I do birthdays,
holidays, all of our vacations.

04:22.828 --> 04:25.096
My favorite thing is
oddly misshapen butt cracks.

04:25.097 --> 04:27.232
Look at that.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.967
Zoom in. Yo!

04:28.968 --> 04:33.037
Tim, would you
turn that thing off?

04:33.038 --> 04:36.774
Careful with that.

04:36.775 --> 04:38.977
So that library thing
was pretty bad, huh?

04:38.978 --> 04:40.811
Let's put it this way.

04:40.812 --> 04:45.483
Jill's speech was so boring,
I had to check my pulse
to see if I was still alive.

04:45.484 --> 04:48.953
Harry, he's exaggerating.
Jill is a very fine speaker.

04:48.954 --> 04:51.622
Generally she is, but she
started quoting some poetry.

04:51.623 --> 04:54.959
It was blanket
and pillow time.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.460
You wanna talk sleep -

04:56.461 --> 04:59.297
My wife starts going on about
her antique button collection?

04:59.298 --> 05:00.664
I'm in a coma.

05:00.665 --> 05:02.166
Hey, forget coma.

05:02.167 --> 05:05.236
Last night, my wife starts
talking about decorating.

05:05.237 --> 05:10.008
Oh, boy.
I was clinically dead
for three minutes.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.076
Clear!

05:12.077 --> 05:14.078
I'm telling ya,
I'm not kidding.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.548
There she is, yakking about
new fabrics for the sunroom.

05:17.549 --> 05:20.618
I didn't know
what the old fabrics
looked like.

05:20.619 --> 05:23.621
I didn't even know
we had a sunroom!

05:23.622 --> 05:25.456
I tell you what kills me -

05:25.457 --> 05:28.226
Is when my wife wants to talk
about our "relationship."

05:28.227 --> 05:30.161
Like you have one.

05:30.162 --> 05:32.163
No, wait. I got a better -

05:32.164 --> 05:34.165
My wife's studying psychology
right now.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.700
Boy, is she boring
when she yammers on
about these terms -

05:36.701 --> 05:40.305
Neurotic, psychotic, halitosis,
neurosis, cirrhosis,
I don't know.

05:40.306 --> 05:43.274
Dysfunction, dat function,
your function.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.343
My wife
is much more boring.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.446
No one is as boring
as my wife.

05:48.447 --> 05:51.582
When my wife talks psychology,
she is the big bopper
of boredom.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.052
So I got this great strategy.
This is so cool.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.054
I just pretend
like I'm listening

05:56.055 --> 05:58.722
And fade her out
and just go, "whuh-huh."

05:58.723 --> 06:01.892
You guys, I'm telling you,
maybe it's 'cause I'm new
to my relationship,

06:01.893 --> 06:04.062
But I like talking to ilene.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.130
<i>(tim, eddie, harry)</i>
whuh-huh. Whuh-huh.

06:09.201 --> 06:12.870
It's true.
I find everything she says
fascinating and illuminating.

06:12.871 --> 06:15.539
<i>(tim, eddie, harry)</i>
whuh-huh.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.143
Al, that's 'cause
in your relationship,
you are the boring one.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.815
<i>To quote my favorite poet,</i>
<i>elizabeth barrett browning...</i>

06:24.816 --> 06:27.285
<i>(clears throat)</i>

06:27.286 --> 06:30.121
<i>"books, books, books.</i>

06:30.122 --> 06:32.957

07:02.121 --> 07:03.787
Whoo!

07:03.788 --> 07:06.557
You were wonderful.
That was great.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.659
I love
elizabeth barrett browning.

07:08.660 --> 07:13.364
"if thou must love me,
let it be for love's sake only."

07:13.365 --> 07:16.501
Put a socketh in it, aleth.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.337
So it was all right?
I was so nervous.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.739
Oh, yeah, you were great.
So commanding.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.208
You look great
in that suit.
Thank you.

07:24.209 --> 07:27.145
I could have seen that tape
over and over and over again.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.648
Thank you, sweetie.
I'm glad you taped it
so we could see it.

07:30.649 --> 07:33.584
I felt like I was there.

07:33.585 --> 07:36.987
<i>(tim) why does everybody</i>
<i>wave at these things?</i>
<i>I do birthdays...</i>

07:36.988 --> 07:39.790
Wait a minute.
Whose butt is this?

07:39.791 --> 07:44.862
I know whose it is.
Very nice, al.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.331
<i>...Turn that thing off?</i>
<i>Careful with that.</i>

07:47.332 --> 07:50.768
<i>So that library thing</i>
<i>was pretty bad?</i>
<i>Let's put it this way.</i>

07:50.769 --> 07:52.770
<i>Jill's speech was so dull,</i>

07:52.771 --> 07:56.307
<i>I had to check my pulse</i>
<i>to see if I was still alive.</i>

07:56.308 --> 07:59.743
<i>(grunts)</i> uh-oh.

07:59.744 --> 08:06.117
Did you tape this?
I didn't know it was on.
I just put it down.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.119
<i>No, I got it worse</i>
<i>than either of you guys.</i>

08:08.120 --> 08:10.121
<i>Now jill is studying</i>
<i>psychology.</i>

08:10.122 --> 08:13.491
<i>Boy, she is so boring</i>
<i>the way she yammers on</i>
<i>with these useless terms.</i>

08:13.492 --> 08:16.561
This is very illuminating.
"so boring"?

08:16.562 --> 08:19.497
That's not what I said.
I said "sobering."

08:21.433 --> 08:23.834
We'll just
let ourselves out.

08:23.835 --> 08:27.405
No. We gotta see that tape
on the wisdom teeth.

08:27.406 --> 08:32.009
We'll leave it with you, ok?
How about coffee?
We gotta have coffee.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.011
I'll make that cappuccino stuff.
I'll make a pie.

08:35.013 --> 08:37.448
Why don't you stay the night?!

08:42.988 --> 08:45.889
Well, I suppose
you wanna talk about this?

08:45.890 --> 08:48.092
Oh, no.
I wouldn't wanna bore you.

08:48.093 --> 08:51.095
That's all right.
Go ahead.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.797
I mean I wanna hear
what you have to say.

08:53.798 --> 08:55.799
I've already heard
what you have to say.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.801
I was at a hardware store
talking with guys.

08:57.802 --> 09:01.339
Is this how you really feel
about me?
No, it's just what I say.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.376
It's a hardware store,
an inner sanctum for guys.
We say whatever we wanna say.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.879
Oh, I see. So you don't
have to be accountable
for what you say?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.915
Yes. No. You're blowing this
all out of proportion.

09:11.916 --> 09:15.353
You know how men talk.
You and your girlfriends
do the same thing.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.623
That is not true.
I have never once said
anything behind your back

09:18.624 --> 09:20.258
That I haven't said
to your face.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.528
That just proves
I'm more sensitive than you.
How?

09:23.529 --> 09:25.530
If I have something
to say about you,

09:25.531 --> 09:29.933
I have the courtesy to take it
to a hardware store and say it
in front of strangers.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.902
That's insane.

09:31.903 --> 09:35.406
It was a conversation
you should've never heard.

09:35.407 --> 09:38.108
It was a conversation
that you never should have had.

09:38.109 --> 09:41.879
It was a conversation
you shouldn't have seen.
This conversation is over.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.183
Well, that's good
because I'm sick of saying
the word "conversation"!

09:52.257 --> 09:55.493
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

09:55.494 --> 09:57.495
It's rock-'n'-roll day
on <i>tool time,</i>

09:57.496 --> 10:01.098
With those rocking tool men,
tim taylor and al borland.
Whoo!

10:01.099 --> 10:03.501
<i>(♪ rock-'n'-roll)</i>

10:13.878 --> 10:17.147
Heidi. Heidi.

10:17.148 --> 10:18.616
Heidi!

10:22.954 --> 10:24.455
Hi. Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

10:24.456 --> 10:26.957
I am
tim "the cool man" taylor,

10:26.958 --> 10:30.595
And you all know my assistant,
the king, al-vis.

10:30.596 --> 10:33.197
<i>(imitating elvis)</i> thank you.
Thank you very much.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.600
Today, we're gonna have
a rocking good time,

10:35.601 --> 10:39.337
Because we're gonna be
building ourselves
a rocking chair.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.174
This is the last theme show
we're gonna do.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.943
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

10:45.944 --> 10:48.779
A rocking...
Could we?

10:48.780 --> 10:51.782
<i>(normal voice)</i> all right,
well, yesterday,
if you remember,

10:51.783 --> 10:54.084
We bent the wood
for the frame of our chair

10:54.085 --> 10:56.086
By putting it
in this steamer box.

10:56.087 --> 10:59.423
The steam
made the wood pliable
and easy to shape.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.726
Speaking of steam,
I wanna let off some.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.093
Tim.
Al.

11:03.094 --> 11:07.164
Why don't women understand
that men need a place to be men?

11:07.165 --> 11:10.501
To get together with other men
and discuss manly things.
Right, men?

11:10.502 --> 11:12.436
<i>(men)</i> yeah.

11:12.437 --> 11:14.438
All kinds of men stuff,
you know -

11:14.439 --> 11:16.274
From v-8 engines
to smelly feet,

11:16.275 --> 11:19.877
To what annoys us most
about our wives. <i>(grunts)</i>

11:19.878 --> 11:23.113
Where do you nag
about the little lady?
Divorce court.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.286
Moving along.
You up there, sir. You, sir.

11:28.287 --> 11:31.121
Where were you the last time
you were with a group of men

11:31.122 --> 11:33.758
Letting off steam about women?

11:33.759 --> 11:36.627
Jackson state
penitentiary.

11:37.962 --> 11:41.565
Well, I'm glad we made
this little journey. Al?

11:41.566 --> 11:45.903
All right. If you remember,
I told you that we've already
bent our wood.

11:45.904 --> 11:48.606
Now we're ready to make
the legs and posts
of our chair

11:48.607 --> 11:52.009
Using the binford 6100
variable-speed wood lathe.

11:52.010 --> 11:56.914
That's right.
Now, we first use a rough gouge
to take off the square edges.

11:56.915 --> 12:00.685
Then al will use
the 1/2-inch round nose
to start shaping our piece.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.321
Marv, bring the camera,
and let's take a look at this.

12:03.322 --> 12:07.090
There are various
types of patterns
to shape your legs,

12:07.091 --> 12:09.226
Or you can do it freehand.

12:09.227 --> 12:11.429
It's a very difficult skill
to master.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.432
You might wanna practice
on a spare piece of wood.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.934
That's good advice.
I'll give you more good advice.

12:16.935 --> 12:19.437
Always think safety
when working with
a spinning lathe.

12:19.438 --> 12:22.105
You notice
I didn't wear a necktie.
We get letters about this.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.809
You want nothing hanging down
and no loose clothing.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.411
The possibility...
<i>(laughter)</i>

12:27.412 --> 12:30.214
Let me finish.

12:30.215 --> 12:31.849
Sometimes...

12:40.992 --> 12:43.427
If you get too close
to a lathe,

12:43.428 --> 12:47.030
You can lose
an article of clothing.

12:47.031 --> 12:49.266
Is it a little chilly
in here?

12:51.436 --> 12:54.405
<i>(wilson hums)</i>

12:55.907 --> 12:58.609
Hey, wilson?
Hi-de-ho, neighborette.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.711
Can you do me a favor?

13:00.712 --> 13:03.080
Tim is running late
and I have a psychology class.

13:03.081 --> 13:06.817
Can you keep an eye
on the kids for me?
That'll be my pleasure, jill.

13:06.818 --> 13:10.153
How did that
elizabeth barrett browning
poem I gave you work out?

13:10.154 --> 13:11.522
Not too well with tim.

13:11.523 --> 13:13.357
After he taped my speech,

13:13.358 --> 13:15.693
He accidentally taped himself
making fun of me

13:15.694 --> 13:17.160
At the hardware store.

13:17.161 --> 13:18.328
Yeow.

13:18.329 --> 13:21.265
I guess I can expect tim
out here pretty soon.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.200
I doubt it.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.903
He didn't even think
he did anything wrong.

13:25.904 --> 13:29.039
He said he was only doing
what <i>(deep voice)</i> all guys do
when they get together.

13:29.040 --> 13:34.244
Well, jill,
the renowned psychiatrist
irvin d. Yalom

13:34.245 --> 13:36.814
Postulated that men
relieve their isolation

13:36.815 --> 13:39.750
By bonding over
common fears and experiences.

13:39.751 --> 13:43.053
Please. Yalom was talking
about universality as it
applies to formal therapy,

13:43.054 --> 13:45.756
Not a bunch of guys
sitting around dumping
on their wives.

13:50.028 --> 13:52.062
Well, that-that's
an excellent point.

13:52.063 --> 13:54.264
However,
knowing tim as I do,

13:54.265 --> 13:56.534
I'm sure it was
just an innocent exchange

13:56.535 --> 13:58.168
Bearing no real malice.

13:58.169 --> 14:01.371
<i>(giggles)</i>

14:01.372 --> 14:03.641
As freud
so humorously pointed out,

14:03.642 --> 14:06.410
"sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar."

14:06.411 --> 14:09.680
That is such a crock.

14:09.681 --> 14:12.149
As carl jung says,
"if people can be educated

14:12.150 --> 14:14.318
"to see the lowly side
of their own natures,

14:14.319 --> 14:18.388
Then they might also understand
their fellow man or woman
better."

14:18.389 --> 14:22.125
Well, with all due respect
to jung, I believe it was
bruno bettelheim -

14:22.126 --> 14:24.227
Oh, don't bettelheim me.

14:24.228 --> 14:27.264
Tim was talking about me
behind my back,

14:27.265 --> 14:30.434
And you know what andrea dworkin
says about that.

14:30.435 --> 14:33.070
Oh, actually, I don't.

14:33.071 --> 14:36.574
She says if women talk about
people behind their backs,
they call it "gossip,"

14:36.575 --> 14:39.409
But if men do it, it's
<i>(deep voice)</i> "male bonding."

14:40.846 --> 14:43.848
Jill, ever since you decided
to go back to school,

14:43.849 --> 14:46.383
You've made things
so very, very hard on me.

14:51.289 --> 14:54.892
That your card?
Yeah. How'd you do that?

14:54.893 --> 14:57.928
Guess what I have.
Rabies?

14:59.430 --> 15:02.399
No. This videotape.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.402
I heard mom and dad
arguing about it last night,

15:05.403 --> 15:07.905
So then I came down
and got the tape.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.907
Hey, that was pretty sneaky.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.209
You know, mark,
if you keep this up,

15:12.210 --> 15:14.712
You might actually
turn into a person.

15:14.713 --> 15:18.048
Thanks.
I really wanna be a person.

15:18.049 --> 15:20.050
<i>No one is as boring</i>
<i>as my wife.</i>

15:20.051 --> 15:22.052
<i>Guys, guys, believe me.</i>
<i>I got it -</i>

15:22.053 --> 15:23.954
<i>When jill's talking</i>
<i>about psychology,</i>

15:23.955 --> 15:25.956
<i>She's the big bopper</i>
<i>of boredom...</i>

15:25.957 --> 15:29.426
Whoa. Mom saw this
and dad's still alive?

15:30.862 --> 15:34.364
Yeah, well,
the night is still young.

15:34.365 --> 15:37.467
Hey, shut that off.
You guys shouldn't
be watching that.

15:37.468 --> 15:38.702
Why not?

15:38.703 --> 15:41.271
Why? Because it's
private adult stuff.

15:41.272 --> 15:43.073
You wouldn't understand.

15:43.074 --> 15:44.842
You're making fun of mom.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.844
What's so hard
to understand?

15:46.845 --> 15:51.214
I'm not making fun of mom.
I'm making fun of my wife.

15:51.215 --> 15:53.717
Dad, I don't know
if you realize this,

15:53.718 --> 15:56.153
But they're
the same person.

15:56.154 --> 15:57.988
It's a joke,
a little joke.

15:57.989 --> 15:59.823
She knows it.
End of story, ok?

15:59.824 --> 16:01.659
Why isn't she
talking to you?

16:01.660 --> 16:04.528
You're starting to act
a lot like brad and randy.

16:04.529 --> 16:06.597
Thanks.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.599
Let me explain something
to you guys.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.101
A lot of things
can be said in the privacy
of a hardware store

16:11.102 --> 16:14.137
That cannot be said
in public places
like your home.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.649
So what you're saying is
you can make fun of mom,
but not when she's around.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.651
No, that's <i>not</i>
what I'm saying.

16:27.652 --> 16:29.486
Then what are you saying?

16:29.487 --> 16:31.989
It's disrespectful
to say anything
about other people

16:31.990 --> 16:33.490
When they're not around.

16:33.491 --> 16:36.493
Especially
if a camera is rolling.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.464
Gotcha, dad.

16:40.465 --> 16:42.800
Upstairs.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:42.801 --> 16:43.901
Good luck, dad.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.335
Hi, mom.
Bye, mom.

16:45.336 --> 16:46.604
<i>(brad)</i> hi, mom.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.206
Hi.

16:49.207 --> 16:52.242
Jill, I'm really sorry
about the stuff on this tape.

16:52.243 --> 16:54.078
You are?

16:54.079 --> 16:57.081
You know how I am.
I started getting laughs.
I get on a roll.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.084
When I get like that,
I don't really think
about what I'm saying.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.586
To be honest with you,
your speech wasn't that bad.

17:02.587 --> 17:06.589
Look, what you said
about my speech
was humiliating,

17:06.590 --> 17:09.893
But what really got to me
was the way that you put me down

17:09.894 --> 17:12.262
For talking
about my psychology classes.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.664
I didn't mean that.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.031
Tim, come on.

17:15.032 --> 17:18.035
Do you think I don't notice
the way your eyes glaze over

17:18.036 --> 17:21.171
Every time I try
to talk to you about it?

17:23.742 --> 17:26.743
I know that you think
it's a bunch of gobbledegook,
but I love it.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.278
I'm working really hard.

17:28.279 --> 17:31.115
I'm juggling my life around
so I can make this thing happen,

17:31.116 --> 17:33.684
And when you demean it,
it's just...

17:33.685 --> 17:36.754
It hurts me.

17:43.728 --> 17:46.664
S-so who-who's
gonna make dinner?

18:02.781 --> 18:04.815
Tim, I need this book.
In a minute.

18:04.816 --> 18:08.018
I'm reading something here
about my souped-up ego.

18:10.621 --> 18:14.624
That's "superego."
why are you reading my book?

18:14.625 --> 18:17.661
I wanna find out why
this is so interesting to you.

18:17.662 --> 18:20.731
Because you want to
or because you feel guilty?

18:20.732 --> 18:23.701
According to chapter two,
a little of both.

18:26.571 --> 18:28.172
You read two chapters?

18:28.173 --> 18:33.376
Yes, and the chapter
on animal sexuality's
quite interesting.

18:34.779 --> 18:38.048
You really think so?
Yeah.

18:38.049 --> 18:41.118
I'm not saying a few pictures
wouldn't help the process.

18:44.889 --> 18:47.124
Well, if you think
that's interesting,

18:47.125 --> 18:51.028
Wait till you get to the chapter
on aberrant female sexuality.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.163
Read it.

18:54.899 --> 18:57.067
Actually started
with that chapter first.

18:58.903 --> 19:02.106
From now on, I'm reading
everything you read.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.742
You don't have to go that far.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.911
Honey, when I go at something,
I go full-bore.

19:07.912 --> 19:10.114
Something else
I figured out we might do.

19:10.115 --> 19:13.550
I'm gonna take you
to see those three tenors
that you love on pbs -

19:13.551 --> 19:16.820
Paparazzi, manicotti
and flamingo.

19:16.821 --> 19:19.623
<i>(imitating opera singer)</i>

19:23.628 --> 19:26.864
Tim, you just named
a photographer,

19:26.865 --> 19:29.432
A food and a hotel.

19:29.433 --> 19:32.836
I don't care what they do.
They sing great.

19:32.837 --> 19:34.838
Well, that would be
really nice,

19:34.839 --> 19:38.175
Because... It's always
been my fantasy
to be with a man

19:38.176 --> 19:40.677
Who enjoyed doing
the same things I do.

19:40.678 --> 19:44.681
You know, like taking me
to the opera, the ballet,
the theater.

19:44.682 --> 19:47.417
That's my fantasy, too.

19:47.418 --> 19:49.019
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.022
If I could find that man,
I wouldn't have to go myself.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.100
What is your real fantasy?

20:08.506 --> 20:12.409
It involves some twins
and a yo-yo.

20:14.979 --> 20:17.714
Yeah, I know
who the yo-yo is.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.495
Hi.

20:32.496 --> 20:34.631
Oh, no,
what have you taped now?

20:34.632 --> 20:37.534
More pearls of wisdom
from the hardware store?

20:37.535 --> 20:40.537
No. Actually, I went back
and looked at the tape.

20:40.538 --> 20:43.941
There's a second part
of the conversation
you never even saw.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.943
You should
take a look at it.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.045
I don't think so.
I've seen enough.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.280
No, really. Come over here
and take a look at this.

20:53.952 --> 20:55.953
<i>You know, harry,</i>
<i>on second thought,</i>

20:55.954 --> 20:57.454
<i>I really did enjoy</i>
<i>my wife's speech.</i>

20:59.390 --> 21:01.491
You took this
five minutes later?
Yeah.

21:01.492 --> 21:04.427
You're wearing
different clothes.

21:04.428 --> 21:07.097
Men in hardware stores
change frequently.

21:09.734 --> 21:14.771
<i>(stiltedly) t-tool man,</i>
<i>you have shown me the way.</i>

21:14.772 --> 21:17.875
<i>Because of you...</i>

21:17.876 --> 21:21.511
<i>I now realize how much</i>
<i>I love talking to my wife</i>

21:21.512 --> 21:24.314
<i>About her needs.</i>

21:26.751 --> 21:30.854
Now, that is
realistic dialogue.

21:30.855 --> 21:35.592
<i>Tool man,</i>
<i>you are the greatest.</i>

21:35.593 --> 21:37.294
<i>You have shown me</i>

21:37.295 --> 21:40.998
<i>The love that I have</i>
<i>for my mife.</i>

21:42.733 --> 21:45.769
<i>Your w's look like m's.</i>
<i>That's why I said "mife."</i>

21:45.770 --> 21:47.804
Your w's do look like m's.

21:47.805 --> 21:50.640
<i>Well, it's good</i>
<i>we got in touch</i>
<i>with our true feelings.</i>

21:50.641 --> 21:52.642
<i>I certainly didn't mean</i>
<i>to hurt my wife,</i>

21:52.643 --> 21:55.412
<i>And I... I hope</i>
<i>that she knows that?</i>

21:55.413 --> 21:58.081
Yeah, yeah, she knows that.

21:59.550 --> 22:03.853
<i>(mimicking eddie)</i> tool man,
you are the greatest.

22:06.424 --> 22:10.294
I am so happy
to be your mife.

22:13.898 --> 22:16.233
Look, how easy this thing is.
Oh, oh, oh.

22:16.234 --> 22:17.935
<i>(grunts)</i>

22:20.939 --> 22:23.573
Hmm.

22:23.574 --> 22:25.642
Might be just a bit hot.

22:30.614 --> 22:35.085
Harry, he's "exaggeuating."
jill is a very fine speaker.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.988
<i>(laughter)</i>
