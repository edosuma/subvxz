43:17.464 --> 43:18.334
Fuck man.

43:22.208 --> 43:23.383
Hey, no, no please
don't hurt them.

43:23.383 --> 43:24.253
Don't!

43:25.864 --> 43:27.126
What the fuck, man, come on.

43:27.126 --> 43:29.694
Alfonso, I'm here to
see Alfonso, okay?

43:29.694 --> 43:30.608
Alfonso.

43:32.131 --> 43:33.959
Come on, come on, fuck man.

44:09.821 --> 44:12.824
Carl.

44:12.824 --> 44:15.000
You look different.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.045
So what, what do you do?

44:20.266 --> 44:21.528
Where is Carl?

44:21.528 --> 44:23.225
Okay, I don't know.

44:23.225 --> 44:24.618
I, I, I'm Sean, okay?

44:24.618 --> 44:25.445
I work with Carl.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.577
Oh, you're Sean.

44:27.577 --> 44:28.709
You are Sean.

44:30.102 --> 44:33.714
So Carl has a better
thing to do or what?

44:33.714 --> 44:34.628
No, I don't know.

44:34.628 --> 44:36.499
He he's supposed to be here.

45:13.580 --> 45:14.581
I don't know what's
going on, okay?

45:14.581 --> 45:15.408
I wanna help you.

45:15.408 --> 45:16.235
You are the law?

45:16.235 --> 45:17.584
No, no, no, no!

45:17.584 --> 45:19.760
- Come here.
- No, please, please.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.371
Please, please, please, please.

45:37.299 --> 45:38.692
Go, go, go, go!

45:49.616 --> 45:51.139
Go, go, go, go!

45:53.011 --> 45:54.273
Go!

45:59.931 --> 46:01.106
Run!

46:05.806 --> 46:07.590
This way, this way.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.296
Come on, fuck!

46:17.296 --> 46:18.645
We gotta get off this
fucking road, come on!

46:20.865 --> 46:22.475
Get your
ass in the car.

46:22.475 --> 46:24.477
Jeez, come on, Mel.

46:24.477 --> 46:26.044
Sean, who the
fuck are these guys?

46:26.044 --> 46:27.219
I don't
fucking know, okay?

46:29.395 --> 46:30.875
I'm so
sick of this shit.

46:30.875 --> 46:31.963
Why the fuck
did you follow me?

46:31.963 --> 46:33.051
Go, go, Mel, go, Mel!

46:33.051 --> 46:35.183
- Go, Mel!
- Shit, wait.

46:35.183 --> 46:38.056
Shit, get
down, get down.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.368
Okay, okay, go.

46:46.368 --> 46:47.413
Go, go!

46:54.420 --> 46:56.378
What the fuck happened, Sean?

46:56.378 --> 46:58.859
It was fucking Carl, he
ran off with the diamonds.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.080
- Diamonds?
- Just go, Mel!

47:03.472 --> 47:04.865
- Whoa, whoa, Mel, Melanie.
- What are you doing?

47:04.865 --> 47:05.692
What are you
doing, what are you doing?

47:05.692 --> 47:06.911
Fuck this.

47:06.911 --> 47:07.868
- No, no, no, no.
- And fuck you too,

47:07.868 --> 47:09.043
Look, look, look, look.

47:09.043 --> 47:11.176
We have to get back
to the boat now.

47:11.176 --> 47:12.090
She's right, okay?

47:12.090 --> 47:13.047
They're gonna come after us.

47:13.047 --> 47:14.266
It's the only place we're safe.

47:14.266 --> 47:16.616
We have to be
together on this.

47:23.362 --> 47:24.232
Please.

47:43.904 --> 47:44.731
Welcome back to the boat.

47:44.731 --> 47:46.428
Thank you.

47:48.648 --> 47:50.606
You know we can't
say anything, right?

47:50.606 --> 47:52.434
- Welcome back to the boat.
- Thank you.

47:52.434 --> 47:54.480
Please, thank you.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.612
I am serious, trust me.

47:59.224 --> 48:01.487
How was your day, ladies?

48:02.401 --> 48:04.055
Really great.

48:04.055 --> 48:05.012
This way.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.885
Passport, please.

48:19.984 --> 48:20.941
What are you doing?

48:20.941 --> 48:22.769
I'm fucking leaving.

48:22.769 --> 48:23.944
Mel, relax.

48:23.944 --> 48:25.467
Okay, we made it back safe.

48:25.467 --> 48:26.860
I don't feel safe, okay?

48:26.860 --> 48:28.166
You fucking lied to me.

48:28.166 --> 48:30.081
We weren't supposed
to be involved.

48:30.081 --> 48:32.910
Smuggling diamonds
is involved.

48:35.173 --> 48:39.177
Oh my God, you,
you recruited me.

48:39.177 --> 48:40.613
You're in on this whole thing.

48:40.613 --> 48:42.789
Okay, don't be
fucking paranoid.

48:42.789 --> 48:44.138
You're the one who
wanted to follow him.

48:44.138 --> 48:46.314
Because you made me
feel like it was safe.

48:46.314 --> 48:48.360
Fuck Chloe, I lied to my dad.

48:48.360 --> 48:49.970
That's not on me.

48:51.885 --> 48:54.366
I thought we were
just having fun.

48:54.366 --> 48:56.542
Yeah, of course you did.

48:56.542 --> 48:57.847
What does that mean?

48:57.847 --> 49:00.850
It means I am not here
on some Insta joy ride.

49:00.850 --> 49:03.201
I am here because I owe
a bunch of shady dudes

49:03.201 --> 49:05.899
a shit ton of money
and my life is fucked.

49:05.899 --> 49:07.509
You get to leave here

49:07.509 --> 49:11.949
and go back to your beautiful,
perfect, safe little life.

49:13.298 --> 49:14.168
I don't.

49:16.301 --> 49:17.693
I'm so stupid.

49:22.829 --> 49:24.526
I actually thought
we were friends.

49:40.412 --> 49:43.893
Look, Jules, I
can fix this, okay?

49:43.893 --> 49:46.592
Ernie's got other suppliers,
I, I, I can ask him if he,

49:46.592 --> 49:49.421
if he fucking-
- Shut the fuck up.

49:50.900 --> 49:54.730
Now on you just watch the
girls, specially Melanie.

49:55.862 --> 49:57.081
What are you gonna do?

49:57.081 --> 49:58.908
I'm gonna
clean up your mess.

49:58.908 --> 50:00.910
Now get back to
the fucking boat.

50:27.459 --> 50:30.592
Um, are you Mel, right?

50:31.811 --> 50:32.768
Yeah.

50:32.768 --> 50:33.769
Oh my God told you.

50:33.769 --> 50:35.119
We saw your post of Panama.

50:35.119 --> 50:36.946
You guys are amazing.

50:38.296 --> 50:40.124
Thanks for following us.

50:40.124 --> 50:41.995
Nice to meet you guys.

50:43.388 --> 50:45.346
Hey, you want a photo?

50:53.441 --> 50:54.616
All right.

50:54.616 --> 50:55.922
Thank you.

50:55.922 --> 50:56.792
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

50:56.792 --> 50:58.620
- I'll tag you.
- Bye.

51:00.579 --> 51:03.277
Hey, you need to stay calm.

51:03.277 --> 51:04.496
Hey, if you like,
everything is fine,

51:04.496 --> 51:07.151
then everything is fine.

51:07.151 --> 51:08.108
Fuck you.

51:21.643 --> 51:22.470
Okay, okay.

51:23.471 --> 51:24.342
Shh.

51:25.995 --> 51:29.216
No, Tolu, I'm on it, okay?

51:30.261 --> 51:32.045
Fuck!
- What happened?

51:32.045 --> 51:35.309
Carl took off with the
diamonds, completely fucked us!

51:44.536 --> 51:46.407
Now let ask something.

51:48.061 --> 51:49.584
Why were you there?

51:50.846 --> 51:52.457
'Cause Melanie wanted
to go after Sean, right?

51:52.457 --> 51:54.285
Panama's fucking sketchy
so I went with her.

51:54.285 --> 51:55.547
You should have stopped her.

51:55.547 --> 51:57.636
I told you not to
trust these guys.

51:57.636 --> 51:59.333
I was fucking right.

52:00.813 --> 52:03.120
Do you even care that I
almost got killed today?

52:04.164 --> 52:07.036
Not what I signed up for, Jules.

52:07.036 --> 52:08.995
Neither did Melanie.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.344
You know what?

52:12.303 --> 52:14.305
You brought her here, okay?

52:14.305 --> 52:15.306
Not me.

52:17.656 --> 52:19.658
Oh, do not fucking.

52:19.658 --> 52:20.528
Yeah.

52:22.008 --> 52:22.878
On my way.

52:24.750 --> 52:26.578
What are you doing?

52:26.578 --> 52:28.145
I'm handling it.

52:31.017 --> 52:32.236
Jules!

52:45.423 --> 52:49.514
♪ I've been deaf ears,
I've been deaf ears ♪

52:49.514 --> 52:53.344

I was worried.

53:48.616 --> 53:49.487
Look,

53:51.315 --> 53:53.273
I said some shit yesterday

53:54.666 --> 53:56.363
and I'm sorry.

53:57.799 --> 54:00.280
Mel, if I had known, fuck it.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.673
It doesn't even matter.

54:01.673 --> 54:03.370
I should not have
brought you here.

54:05.851 --> 54:09.985
I just, I really wanted
to be your friend.

54:18.342 --> 54:21.388
If we stay here, we're safe.

54:44.324 --> 54:46.544
Were you just in my room?

54:46.544 --> 54:47.632
No.

54:47.632 --> 54:48.807
You left the door open.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.983
I just closed it for you.

54:55.727 --> 54:57.555
Is there anything else I
could do for you, ma'am?

54:57.555 --> 54:58.425
No.

55:00.253 --> 55:01.341
Okay.

55:35.680 --> 55:36.550
Hey.

55:39.074 --> 55:41.207
You know, I, I never thanked you

55:46.691 --> 55:47.735
for the car.

55:49.084 --> 55:51.478
I mean, you totally saved us.

55:52.392 --> 55:53.959
How'd you do that?

55:54.916 --> 55:56.614
My dad's mechanic.

55:57.963 --> 55:59.486
I think you're the mechanic.

56:05.231 --> 56:06.101
I, uh,

56:08.887 --> 56:11.106
I figured I should try it.

56:12.412 --> 56:15.589
Though I'm only
following one person.

56:15.589 --> 56:16.982
She posts a lot.

56:40.440 --> 56:43.051
So what was Sean
talking to you about?

56:47.839 --> 56:51.016
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but I'm trying to help you.

56:56.108 --> 56:56.978
Okay.

57:24.310 --> 57:25.180
Shit!

57:29.315 --> 57:31.491
What the fuck?

57:38.193 --> 57:38.977
Hey,
what are you doing?

57:38.977 --> 57:40.239
Sean can help us.

57:40.239 --> 57:41.501
Look, think about
that for a second.

57:42.546 --> 57:45.331
This was not an accident.

57:45.331 --> 57:47.376
They're not gonna care
if you like it or not.

57:47.376 --> 57:48.856
You think Sean did this?

57:51.511 --> 57:53.121
I think they both did.

57:53.905 --> 57:55.167
The boat people.

57:55.167 --> 57:56.647
We can call Emma
and, and tell them-

57:56.647 --> 57:59.040
That we have a family
pack of cocaine in the room.

58:00.738 --> 58:02.348
This is worth millions.

58:02.348 --> 58:03.741
And, and if the
cops get involved,

58:03.741 --> 58:07.440
then the people who own
this are gonna come for us.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.876
We have to think.

58:11.009 --> 58:16.057
Right now, they don't
know we found it.

58:16.884 --> 58:17.755
So we need to keep it that way.

58:17.755 --> 58:18.582
Why would they do this?

58:18.582 --> 58:19.844
We look innocent.

58:19.844 --> 58:21.541
And if shit hits the
fan better us than them.

58:21.541 --> 58:22.368
I wanna get out here.

58:22.368 --> 58:25.110
Melanie, Melanie, Mel.

58:25.110 --> 58:26.720
We will, okay?

58:26.720 --> 58:31.420
But right now we just have
to play cool and act normal.

58:34.380 --> 58:36.121
When we get to
Lima, we are gone.

58:36.121 --> 58:37.644
What if they search our cabin?

58:40.604 --> 58:43.084
There will nothing to find.

59:13.593 --> 59:15.160
Oh.

59:16.509 --> 59:18.337
The tour bus says
it's the Old Town,

59:18.337 --> 59:20.861
a few blocks from the embassy.

59:23.298 --> 59:24.561
Look, I gotta ask,

59:24.561 --> 59:26.432
have you said anything
to Sean that might-

59:26.432 --> 59:27.781
Of course not.

59:29.435 --> 59:31.045
Sorry.

59:31.045 --> 59:33.308
Okay, you just spent a lot
of time with him and I just-

59:33.308 --> 59:35.093
You told me to act normal.

59:35.093 --> 59:37.791
Yeah, okay, I just
don't trust anyone

59:37.791 --> 59:39.619
on this fucking boat.

59:45.277 --> 59:46.234
Except you.

59:51.152 --> 59:53.807
Are you sure you wanna do this?

59:55.679 --> 59:56.941
Okay.

59:56.941 --> 59:59.639
I'll keep them at the bar.

59:59.639 --> 1:00:00.640
Look at anything
that goes wrong-

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:01.859
Don't worry.

1:00:01.859 --> 1:00:02.729
It won't.

1:00:14.175 --> 1:00:15.699
Apparently Lima's
got these sick

1:00:15.699 --> 1:00:19.659
like ancient tunnels
under the city, catacombs.

1:00:19.659 --> 1:00:20.834
I'm thinking we just-

1:00:20.834 --> 1:00:21.661
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:00:21.661 --> 1:00:23.489
We're staying on board.

1:00:23.489 --> 1:00:24.359
All of us.

1:00:26.405 --> 1:00:28.668
It's too dangerous.

1:00:39.331 --> 1:00:40.245
Hey.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:42.682
I was looking for my stars.

1:00:42.682 --> 1:00:44.031
Where's your BFF?

1:00:44.031 --> 1:00:45.729
She's, uh, tired.

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:48.732
Gotta get that
beauty sleep, right?

1:00:48.732 --> 1:00:51.822
Your posts are generating
tons of engagement.

1:00:51.822 --> 1:00:54.738
That's amazeballs.

1:00:54.738 --> 1:00:56.565
Uh, tll 'em about
the catacombs.

1:00:56.565 --> 1:00:57.392
Oh.

1:01:05.444 --> 1:01:06.401
- Hey.
- What?

1:01:06.401 --> 1:01:08.099
Hey, why are you running off?

1:01:08.099 --> 1:01:09.753
I'm not, I'm just
going to the room.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:10.754
Come on.
- Hey, hey.

1:01:10.754 --> 1:01:11.624
What?

1:01:11.624 --> 1:01:12.494
Come on.

1:01:16.281 --> 1:01:18.239
Can I come in?

1:01:18.239 --> 1:01:19.110
Yeah.

1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:23.767
Yeah, come on.

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:24.681
Here.

1:01:25.638 --> 1:01:26.508
Can I try?

1:01:27.727 --> 1:01:32.166
What the
fuck is up with you?

1:01:35.474 --> 1:01:36.301
What are you doing?

1:01:36.301 --> 1:01:37.128
Come on.
- I don't know.

1:01:37.128 --> 1:01:38.042
I'm just having fun.

1:01:38.042 --> 1:01:39.304
What the fuck is up with you?

1:01:39.304 --> 1:01:40.566
- This, do you want this?
- Come on.

1:01:40.566 --> 1:01:41.219
- This, you want it?
- Yeah, come on.

1:01:43.917 --> 1:01:44.744
I gotta pee.
- Yeah.

1:01:44.744 --> 1:01:45.658
Come on.

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:49.096
- Jules.
- Yeah.

1:01:49.096 --> 1:01:53.274
Just, um, thank you
for bringing me here.

1:01:53.274 --> 1:01:54.841
Sure, no problem.

1:02:00.151 --> 1:02:01.021
God.

1:02:02.893 --> 1:02:04.459
Could you shut the door?

1:02:04.459 --> 1:02:06.331
Yeah, sorry.

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:09.682
Melanie?

1:02:09.682 --> 1:02:10.552
Mel?

1:02:12.337 --> 1:02:13.294
Go, go, go.

1:02:24.262 --> 1:02:26.177
You want another drink?

1:02:34.533 --> 1:02:36.187
Have you seen my passport?

1:02:36.187 --> 1:02:37.971
No.

1:02:37.971 --> 1:02:40.017
It's probably with mine.

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.378
I can't find mine.

1:02:54.379 --> 1:02:56.163
Oh, fucking course.

1:02:57.817 --> 1:02:59.514
He
took our passports.

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:13.877
In addition to rich
cultural heritage above ground

1:03:13.877 --> 1:03:17.141
Lima's best kept
secret is its catacombs

1:03:17.141 --> 1:03:20.013
right underneath
the city streets.

1:03:22.015 --> 1:03:23.930
We need to find Emma.

1:03:27.151 --> 1:03:28.195
Emma.

1:03:28.195 --> 1:03:30.328
Hey.

1:03:30.328 --> 1:03:32.069
Is there another
way off the boat?

1:03:32.069 --> 1:03:33.592
The main deck is so crowded

1:03:33.592 --> 1:03:35.724
and lines aren't
really our thing.

1:03:35.724 --> 1:03:36.987
Yeah, we're gonna miss our bus

1:03:36.987 --> 1:03:39.206
and we had some really
cool pics planned.

1:03:39.206 --> 1:03:41.861
Oh, maybe I can help.

1:03:59.618 --> 1:04:00.445
Stop!

1:04:00.445 --> 1:04:01.402
Please wait!

1:04:02.926 --> 1:04:04.753
No, stop, stop, stop!

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:08.061
- Thanks Emma.
- Hang on.

1:04:08.061 --> 1:04:08.932
But first.

1:04:10.194 --> 1:04:11.195
Okay.

1:04:12.196 --> 1:04:13.066
Great.

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:16.635
I, I tag you.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:03.638
Fucking tour bus.

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:14.911
Okay, it's gotta be
around here some place.

1:06:01.479 --> 1:06:03.046
Please, we just wanna go home.

1:06:03.046 --> 1:06:04.525
Just get in the fucking car.

1:06:06.005 --> 1:06:07.920
Jules, Jules, Jules.

1:06:19.758 --> 1:06:20.628
Okay.

1:06:22.761 --> 1:06:23.805
Where is it?

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:27.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:28.854
Where is it?

1:06:28.854 --> 1:06:29.942
What are talking about?

1:06:33.685 --> 1:06:35.121
Okay, okay, fine.

1:06:36.383 --> 1:06:37.950
It's in your room.

1:06:39.778 --> 1:06:41.084
Jules, I swear.

1:06:43.042 --> 1:06:45.131
Jules, put the fucking gun away!

1:06:46.176 --> 1:06:47.046
Please.

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.014
Yeah.

1:07:12.202 --> 1:07:14.030
The next two weeks,

1:07:17.076 --> 1:07:19.644
I want you to enjoy the cruise.

1:07:20.732 --> 1:07:22.647
I want you to keep
a low profile.

1:07:22.647 --> 1:07:24.301
Look at me.

1:07:24.301 --> 1:07:26.912
You're gonna carry the drugs
off the boat in Sydney.

1:07:26.912 --> 1:07:27.956
And I'm gonna meet you there.

1:07:27.956 --> 1:07:28.783
You can't do this.

1:07:28.783 --> 1:07:30.307
Shut the fuck up.

1:07:30.307 --> 1:07:33.788
Nobody's looking twice at
couple pretty girls on vacation.

1:07:33.788 --> 1:07:37.749
Once we're gonna get
paid, we'll cut you in.

1:07:40.404 --> 1:07:41.448
How much?

1:07:42.623 --> 1:07:44.147
- Yeah.
- How much?

1:07:44.147 --> 1:07:46.932
What the fuck?
- We don't have a choice.

1:07:46.932 --> 1:07:48.238
You don't say no to these guys.

1:07:48.238 --> 1:07:50.457
We can still try Tahiti.

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:56.855
How much?

1:07:56.855 --> 1:07:58.117
Yeah.

1:07:58.117 --> 1:08:01.120
We're gonna give
you 50 grand each.

1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:03.122
Do not fuck with me on this.

1:08:03.122 --> 1:08:03.992
We good?

1:08:05.168 --> 1:08:06.038
We good?

1:08:06.038 --> 1:08:06.908
Yes.

1:08:10.999 --> 1:08:12.697
You okay.

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:13.567
Come on.

1:08:31.803 --> 1:08:33.848
Okay, we can figure this out.

1:08:33.848 --> 1:08:35.198
Emma, we know Emma's
not with them.

1:08:35.198 --> 1:08:37.287
Uh, in Tahiti we can
explain, we can explain-

1:08:37.287 --> 1:08:38.462
Mel, stop.

1:08:38.462 --> 1:08:40.290
We're fucked.

1:08:40.290 --> 1:08:42.205
Might as well just
enjoy the ride.

1:08:42.205 --> 1:08:44.032
So that's it,
you're just giving up?

1:08:44.032 --> 1:08:45.817
I'm being realistic.

1:08:45.817 --> 1:08:48.167
Besides it's a lot of money.

1:08:50.387 --> 1:08:52.389
What is wrong with you?

1:08:52.389 --> 1:08:54.913
How does the money enter
your mind right now?

1:08:54.913 --> 1:08:56.436
Doesn't have to.

1:08:57.655 --> 1:09:01.746
It's just, it's always there.

1:09:02.834 --> 1:09:03.704
Ah!

1:09:14.846 --> 1:09:17.718
♪ I'm your escape

1:09:30.253 --> 1:09:33.169
♪ I'm your escape

1:09:37.347 --> 1:09:39.000
Give me some of that.

1:09:59.804 --> 1:10:01.240

Easy now.

1:10:03.242 --> 1:10:04.939

Everybody on this fucking
boat knowing who you are.

1:10:21.086 --> 1:10:22.261
They already do.

1:10:22.261 --> 1:10:23.871
I'm fucking famous.

1:10:37.276 --> 1:10:38.146
Jesus.

1:10:39.670 --> 1:10:41.193
Now listen, you better get
your shit together, okay?

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:42.499
Why?

1:10:42.499 --> 1:10:44.588
Because you look bad if
I kiss somebody else.

1:10:44.588 --> 1:10:47.808
Hey, what the

1:10:47.808 --> 1:10:50.376
Um, whatever the fuck I want.

They'll see, it's missing.

1:11:39.643 --> 1:11:42.646
Call it an advanced payment.

1:11:42.646 --> 1:11:44.256
What happened to big sweaters?

1:11:45.562 --> 1:11:47.215
It was a fucking fantasy.

1:11:48.478 --> 1:11:50.349
Me school,

1:11:52.351 --> 1:11:54.701
it's never gonna fucking happen.

1:11:54.701 --> 1:11:56.137
This is who I am.

1:11:57.922 --> 1:11:59.532
It's who I'm always gonna be.

1:12:00.751 --> 1:12:02.753
I know the real you, okay?

1:12:02.753 --> 1:12:04.450
I like the real you.

1:12:11.022 --> 1:12:12.240
You're good.

1:12:14.373 --> 1:12:16.593
You're like actually good.

1:12:18.899 --> 1:12:20.901
You don't deserve this.

1:12:22.076 --> 1:12:23.774
You know, you should
just get away from me

1:12:23.774 --> 1:12:25.079
while you still can,

1:12:26.254 --> 1:12:27.995
before I infect you.

1:12:29.954 --> 1:12:31.303
I'm not going anywhere.

1:12:31.303 --> 1:12:33.349
Yeah, people say that.

1:12:34.219 --> 1:12:36.787
They always change their minds.

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:06.033
Hey, girls.

1:13:07.339 --> 1:13:09.428
I saw you didn't post from Lima.

1:13:09.428 --> 1:13:11.169
Everything's okay?

1:13:11.169 --> 1:13:13.998
Yeah, just haven't posted yet.

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:16.435
But you're coming to our
beach bash in Tahiti, right?

1:13:16.435 --> 1:13:17.958
It's gonna be lit.

1:13:20.004 --> 1:13:21.614
Yeah, we're gonna
be there for sure.

1:13:21.614 --> 1:13:23.181
- Good.
- Yeah.

1:13:23.181 --> 1:13:24.051
Good.

1:13:24.922 --> 1:13:26.140
Big smile there.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:28.186
Oh wait, wait,
I gotta take this.

1:13:28.186 --> 1:13:29.187
Yeah.

1:13:29.187 --> 1:13:31.494
Okay.

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:37.195
Beautiful.

1:13:37.195 --> 1:13:38.326
I'll tag you.

1:13:46.030 --> 1:13:48.293
No, listen it's
going off the rails.

1:13:48.293 --> 1:13:50.426
Says she's the liability.

1:13:51.470 --> 1:13:52.384
Tomorrow.

1:13:55.300 --> 1:13:57.955
She doesn't deserve this.

1:13:57.955 --> 1:13:59.391
Fine.

1:13:59.391 --> 1:14:00.261
Fuck.

1:14:25.722 --> 1:14:27.071
Hey stop.

1:14:27.071 --> 1:14:28.333
I need you not fucked up.

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:31.075
You don't need me.

1:14:32.424 --> 1:14:34.252
Look where I got you.

1:14:39.344 --> 1:14:40.214
Hey.

1:14:44.567 --> 1:14:46.873
You showed me who I am.

1:14:49.441 --> 1:14:53.924
Before I met you everything
I wanted felt impossible.

1:14:56.579 --> 1:14:58.885
You made me believe myself.

1:15:04.587 --> 1:15:06.676
That's not yours.

1:15:06.676 --> 1:15:08.242
It's in my room.

1:15:10.244 --> 1:15:11.289
You ready?

1:15:12.551 --> 1:15:13.421
Come.

1:15:16.294 --> 1:15:17.164
Not you.

1:15:18.557 --> 1:15:20.254
You're too fucked up.

1:15:20.254 --> 1:15:21.255
Let's go.

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:22.430
It's gonna be fun.

1:15:22.430 --> 1:15:23.606
Hmm.

1:15:23.606 --> 1:15:25.564
Wait, Chloe.

1:15:25.564 --> 1:15:27.566
Fuck
Chloe, she's done.

1:15:56.639 --> 1:16:01.382
Fuck Chloe, she's
done.

1:16:11.088 --> 1:16:14.178
So what's next after this?

1:16:14.178 --> 1:16:15.309
A blue one.

1:16:18.443 --> 1:16:22.403
Um, maybe I'll go back
to school, I don't know.

1:16:24.014 --> 1:16:27.365
What about you, you gonna
just live on a boat forever?

1:16:27.365 --> 1:16:28.627
Not just yet.

1:16:29.541 --> 1:16:31.978
Back home to Sydney.

1:16:31.978 --> 1:16:34.067
I'm gonna see what comes.

1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:38.942
But first I'm off

1:16:38.942 --> 1:16:41.988
to play some disco tunes
for water aerobics.

1:16:43.294 --> 1:16:44.904
Catch you, blondie.

1:17:25.379 --> 1:17:26.250
Again.

1:17:30.428 --> 1:17:32.169
Thank you so much.

1:17:32.169 --> 1:17:34.693
The body of a
35-year-old American male

1:17:34.693 --> 1:17:36.521
was discovered early
Thursday morning,

1:17:36.521 --> 1:17:39.916
just a few miles outside
Panama's capital.

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:42.396
Officials have not yet
released the name of the man,

1:17:42.396 --> 1:17:45.182
but we've been told he
was vacationing in Panama

1:17:45.182 --> 1:17:47.880
and may have traveled to
the region on a cruise ship.

1:19:00.648 --> 1:19:01.911
Melanie!

1:19:09.788 --> 1:19:10.658
Melanie!

1:19:14.314 --> 1:19:15.925
Melanie!

1:19:15.925 --> 1:19:18.362
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:19:21.974 --> 1:19:22.845
Melanie!

1:19:25.456 --> 1:19:29.155
Look I wanna help you, but
I need you to listen to me!

1:19:29.155 --> 1:19:30.026
Melanie.

1:19:33.551 --> 1:19:34.421
Melanie!

1:19:45.693 --> 1:19:46.869
- Stay back!
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

1:19:46.869 --> 1:19:47.783
It's okay.

1:19:50.002 --> 1:19:50.873
Hey.

1:19:52.004 --> 1:19:55.051
- No, please.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:59.098
Look take it if you
don't believe me.

1:20:01.318 --> 1:20:02.188
Okay.

1:20:04.712 --> 1:20:05.583
All right.

1:20:07.367 --> 1:20:08.238
Look.

1:20:10.370 --> 1:20:11.284
Right here.

1:20:14.418 --> 1:20:15.288
Okay?

1:20:21.425 --> 1:20:25.255
Jules isn't expecting
to see you again.

1:20:25.255 --> 1:20:26.125
Look here.

1:20:29.912 --> 1:20:31.391
Okay.

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:33.393
This will get you home.

1:20:33.393 --> 1:20:34.873
Jules is flying to
Sydney in the morning,

1:20:34.873 --> 1:20:37.267
so be gone by then.

1:20:37.267 --> 1:20:41.880
And don't talk to anyone,
especially not Chloe.

1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:43.664
Are you going
back on the boat?

1:20:45.536 --> 1:20:46.319
No.

1:20:47.451 --> 1:20:49.453
Jules doesn't know that.

1:20:51.368 --> 1:20:53.326
What happens to Chloe?

1:20:54.719 --> 1:20:57.678
You can't save
everyone, Melanie.

1:21:00.638 --> 1:21:02.248
Look, before you go,

1:21:03.423 --> 1:21:06.165
I'm gonna need you to
do something for me.

1:21:22.573 --> 1:21:23.443
Hello?

1:21:24.488 --> 1:21:26.925
Don't fuck with me.

1:23:25.217 --> 1:23:27.219
I couldn't leave you.

1:23:45.716 --> 1:23:48.197
We've got to get
away from this shit.

1:23:48.197 --> 1:23:49.067
I know.

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:54.290
But if we dump this now
we can never go home.

1:24:34.504 --> 1:24:36.114
Let me,
let me, let me.

1:24:36.114 --> 1:24:37.115
Fuck.

1:24:37.115 --> 1:24:38.464
We need another suitcase.

1:24:38.464 --> 1:24:41.337
No, I need another suitcase.

1:24:41.337 --> 1:24:44.862
Fuck, I never should have
gotten you into this.

1:24:47.473 --> 1:24:48.953
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

1:24:48.953 --> 1:24:51.738
If anything ever
happened to you,

1:24:52.870 --> 1:24:54.611
I would never, I, I couldn't,

1:24:54.611 --> 1:24:56.134
I just-
- Hey, hey.

1:24:57.004 --> 1:24:58.441
Hey.

1:24:58.441 --> 1:25:00.573
Hey, it's okay.

1:25:01.531 --> 1:25:04.621
Okay, we're in this together.

1:25:04.621 --> 1:25:05.491
Okay?

1:25:07.537 --> 1:25:09.147
I wanted this.

1:25:14.283 --> 1:25:16.937
Clean this up.

1:25:32.649 --> 1:25:33.476
Oh.

1:25:33.476 --> 1:25:35.217
Um, I'm sorry.

1:25:35.217 --> 1:25:38.176
We're doing baggage collection.

1:25:38.176 --> 1:25:39.177
Bags, um.

1:25:41.179 --> 1:25:42.485
Yeah.

1:25:42.485 --> 1:25:44.530
Most people leave them
to be brought down.

1:25:47.359 --> 1:25:49.405
But you're carrying your
own bags off the ship.

1:25:49.405 --> 1:25:50.275
Yeah?

1:25:52.190 --> 1:25:53.365
Yeah.

1:25:53.365 --> 1:25:54.932
Cool, yeah, that's
the way to go.

1:25:54.932 --> 1:25:56.847
It's faster and
nothing gets lost.

1:25:56.847 --> 1:26:00.198
Here give these to
security when you go.

1:26:06.204 --> 1:26:07.945
Hey, one more thing.

1:26:07.945 --> 1:26:09.033
The stern exit is a lot faster

1:26:09.033 --> 1:26:11.427
if you make it there before 10.

1:26:11.427 --> 1:26:12.297
Good luck.

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:37.670
Fuck.

1:26:39.542 --> 1:26:40.499
Fuck, fuck.

1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:43.937
Maybe Emma can help us again.

1:26:43.937 --> 1:26:45.417
Not when we're disembarking.

1:26:45.417 --> 1:26:47.941
These are the customs people.

1:26:53.599 --> 1:26:55.166
Come on, let's go.

1:27:53.877 --> 1:27:54.747
Next.

1:27:58.142 --> 1:27:59.665
Step aside, ma'am.

1:28:01.624 --> 1:28:03.190
Come on.

1:28:03.190 --> 1:28:04.061
This way.

1:28:05.628 --> 1:28:07.499
Thank you.

1:28:09.501 --> 1:28:10.372
Next.

1:28:15.377 --> 1:28:16.334
I still
can't believe you guys

1:28:16.334 --> 1:28:17.640
have crew the whole time.

1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:18.858
Oh yeah, we
like to keep it low key.

1:28:18.858 --> 1:28:20.686
Well, you fooled me.

1:28:20.686 --> 1:28:22.253
You are such a lifesaver.

1:28:22.253 --> 1:28:23.515
Thank you so much.

1:28:23.515 --> 1:28:24.342
Ah, no worries.

1:28:31.828 --> 1:28:33.351
Wrong side, mate.

1:28:33.351 --> 1:28:35.701
Yeah, she's an import.

1:28:35.701 --> 1:28:37.312
Passports please.

1:28:44.188 --> 1:28:46.059
Any personal luggage?
- Just bad clothes.

1:28:46.059 --> 1:28:47.322
Purchase
anything outside the country?

1:28:47.322 --> 1:28:48.932
What do you mean
apart from these two?

1:29:02.424 --> 1:29:06.036
And you too, do
you have any visas?

1:29:06.036 --> 1:29:09.648
We fly out in
the morning, so no.

1:29:10.736 --> 1:29:13.435
Here's
the itinerary.

1:29:26.709 --> 1:29:28.798
Morrison to
checkpoint four, please.

1:29:28.798 --> 1:29:31.191
Morrison to checkpoint four.

1:29:37.067 --> 1:29:38.285
On your way.

1:29:39.765 --> 1:29:41.332
Thanks, boss.

1:30:10.579 --> 1:30:11.623
Here we are.

1:30:12.929 --> 1:30:15.671
Oh, geez, what's in here sand?

1:30:15.671 --> 1:30:17.150
Thank you so much.

1:30:17.150 --> 1:30:18.195
It's right.

1:30:18.195 --> 1:30:19.283
So see you tonight then?

1:30:19.283 --> 1:30:20.763
Uh, yeah, sure.

1:30:20.763 --> 1:30:22.199
Thanks.

1:30:22.199 --> 1:30:24.157
Good, thanks.

1:30:35.691 --> 1:30:37.954
We fucking did it.

1:30:40.217 --> 1:30:41.218
Oh my God.

1:31:48.372 --> 1:31:49.721
who else was involved
with this thing?

1:31:49.721 --> 1:31:50.679
I need names, I need-

1:31:50.679 --> 1:31:52.245

My name is Gregory Lund and

I need to speak to my clients.

1:32:01.864 --> 1:32:02.734
Out.

1:32:05.563 --> 1:32:07.870
Sorry about that, ladies.

1:32:07.870 --> 1:32:09.741
Let's get right to it.

1:32:12.439 --> 1:32:16.226
The reality is we can't
dispute the facts,

1:32:16.226 --> 1:32:21.274
but a guilty plea could decrease
your sentence significantly

1:32:22.101 --> 1:32:23.494
and you'll get better terms.

1:32:23.494 --> 1:32:26.671
Minimum security, family visits.

1:32:28.630 --> 1:32:31.328
The important thing is not
to implicate any associates

1:32:31.328 --> 1:32:33.678
you may or may not have had.

1:32:34.810 --> 1:32:36.420
Why is that the
important thing?

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:37.943
Well, we don't want charges
spreading any further.

1:32:37.943 --> 1:32:40.032
It's not good for anyone.

1:32:41.338 --> 1:32:42.513
I'm sorry, who hired you.

1:32:42.513 --> 1:32:44.559
Oh, that's immaterial.

1:32:45.472 --> 1:32:46.343
Oh.

1:32:47.257 --> 1:32:49.259
You're immaterial.

1:32:49.259 --> 1:32:51.304
Get the fuck outta here.

1:32:53.655 --> 1:32:54.699
All right.

1:32:56.309 --> 1:32:59.617
But ladies, there are far
worse outcomes in life

1:32:59.617 --> 1:33:02.272
than a couple years in jail.

1:33:02.272 --> 1:33:03.578
Think about it.

1:33:20.943 --> 1:33:22.205
Hello?

1:33:22.205 --> 1:33:24.120
You have to
say what happened.

1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:25.121
Tell them everything.

1:33:25.121 --> 1:33:26.426
Who is it this?

1:33:26.426 --> 1:33:27.340
Okay, you can't
go down for this, okay?

1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:28.559
It's not right.

1:33:28.559 --> 1:33:29.778
You were never the target.

1:33:29.778 --> 1:33:32.955
It was Jules and
Carl, the bosses.

1:33:34.043 --> 1:33:34.913
Target?

1:33:36.654 --> 1:33:37.873
Are you a fucking cop?

1:33:37.873 --> 1:33:41.920
God, no, I, I got
busted a year ago.

1:33:43.530 --> 1:33:45.010
They said if I got
them something big,

1:33:45.010 --> 1:33:45.881
I wouldn't do time.

1:33:45.881 --> 1:33:46.664
Why didn't you tell me?

1:33:46.664 --> 1:33:48.884
I couldn't.

1:33:48.884 --> 1:33:50.581
If you got back to Jules.

1:33:50.581 --> 1:33:54.019
The bust, all of
this it was you.

1:33:54.019 --> 1:33:55.673
You were never supposed
to be there, Melanie.

1:33:55.673 --> 1:33:57.414
I told you not to go back.

1:33:57.414 --> 1:33:59.329
Just tell them everything, okay?

1:33:59.329 --> 1:34:00.199
Please.

1:34:01.418 --> 1:34:03.246
You trusted the wrong people.

1:34:04.987 --> 1:34:06.553
Like you.

1:34:07.598 --> 1:34:08.468
Melanie.

1:34:09.905 --> 1:34:10.775
Melanie.

1:34:12.516 --> 1:34:13.386
Melanie.

1:34:17.695 --> 1:34:18.870
Hello?

1:34:20.045 --> 1:34:20.916
Hello.

1:34:22.091 --> 1:34:23.570
Is anybody there?

1:34:25.007 --> 1:34:26.530
Hi, Mom.

1:34:27.836 --> 1:34:29.446
It's me.

1:34:29.446 --> 1:34:31.840
Oh my God, Chloe.

1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:34.364
We've been trying to reach you.

1:34:34.364 --> 1:34:35.495
Are you okay?

1:34:40.196 --> 1:34:44.156
I can't imagine what
you've been going through.

1:34:46.115 --> 1:34:48.378
Dad and I love you.

1:34:48.378 --> 1:34:49.988
We're here for you.

1:34:52.469 --> 1:34:54.253
Can we help you, Chloe?

1:34:54.253 --> 1:34:55.124
Uh,

1:34:59.041 --> 1:34:59.998
I just, uh,

1:35:03.741 --> 1:35:07.092
I just really wanted
to hear your voice.

1:35:26.155 --> 1:35:27.025
Dad.

1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:32.335
I'm so sorry.

1:35:35.904 --> 1:35:37.035
I'm so sorry.

1:35:47.829 --> 1:35:49.004
Dad, I,

1:35:52.703 --> 1:35:57.403
I know I can never
make you understand,

1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:02.974
but being out there
with Chloe, it was,

1:36:05.629 --> 1:36:08.023
it was the best
feeling in the world.

1:36:12.549 --> 1:36:17.032
For the first time in
my life, I felt seen.

1:36:18.860 --> 1:36:20.078
You know?

1:36:23.734 --> 1:36:26.258
People wanted to know me, Dad.

1:36:29.348 --> 1:36:32.177
Thought I'd finally
found myself.

1:36:36.834 --> 1:36:40.707
By the time I realized
how fake everything was

1:36:42.971 --> 1:36:46.844
and what was really
going on, I just.

1:36:46.844 --> 1:36:50.239
Mel, baby, it's okay.

1:36:51.893 --> 1:36:52.894
Look at me.

1:36:56.071 --> 1:36:57.028
I love you.

1:37:01.728 --> 1:37:02.773
I'm sorry.

1:37:06.385 --> 1:37:07.560
I'm so sorry.

1:37:19.442 --> 1:37:20.791
Good evening.

1:37:20.791 --> 1:37:22.706
A major operation
involving security agencies

1:37:22.706 --> 1:37:26.449
from around the world has
culminated on Sydney Harbor

1:37:26.449 --> 1:37:28.190
with a huge drug bust.

1:37:28.190 --> 1:37:29.669
Two Canadian women are
behind bars around.

1:37:29.669 --> 1:37:32.107
It was the
largest around the world cruise

1:37:32.107 --> 1:37:34.587
with numerous exotic
ports of call.

1:37:34.587 --> 1:37:36.024
- Seizer of these drugs-
- But it was a facade.

1:37:36.024 --> 1:37:37.634
Has disrupted
the supply of cocaine

1:37:37.634 --> 1:37:39.897
to the streets of
Sydney and beyond.

1:37:39.897 --> 1:37:41.246
- This is the biggest seizure.
- At the time was

1:37:41.246 --> 1:37:43.292
partially motivated
to commit this crime

1:37:43.292 --> 1:37:46.077
because she wanted to
post photos to Instagram

1:37:46.077 --> 1:37:48.732
from glamorous locations
around the world.

1:37:48.732 --> 1:37:50.429
She spent-
- The vacation of a lifetime,

1:37:50.429 --> 1:37:54.129
at least according to the
images they posted on Instagram.
