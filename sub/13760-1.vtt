to stop doing

10:50.150 --> 10:53.284
the only thing I became good at
out of necessity.

10:53.286 --> 10:57.255
You forced us into this life.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.026
If it wasn't for me
getting us out of that mess,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.828
running our business,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.598
you'd be back at being the
dirt-poor farmer that you were.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.434
When you get like
this,
you say hurtful
things.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.836
Well, if truth hurts,
I'm sorry,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.205
but that's just the way it is.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.608
We're planning
on expanding to Texas.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.611

11:19.613 --> 11:21.446
- I'll take
Texas.
- Texas?

11:21.448 --> 11:24.149
- You take Texas?
- Yes...

11:24.151 --> 11:27.385
away from you
and your election.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.921
And you're gonna provide
me
with the product I need.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.125
Think of it as
alimony.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.862

11:55.015 --> 11:58.883

11:58.885 --> 12:00.819

12:02.856 --> 12:05.990

12:05.992 --> 12:09.728

Perdón.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.969
I was just--just looking

12:22.109 --> 12:24.175
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

Let's blame her.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.718

I've heard a lot good things
about you from Guero.

12:36.256 --> 12:40.959

I met her at brunch.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.165
Really, she thinks
she's so classy.

I'll call you right back.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.680
What happened?

13:35.682 --> 13:36.981
We were ambushed.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.616
We got
to the landing strip,

13:38.618 --> 13:41.186
and everyone was dead.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.420
There were Federales everywhere.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.156
They just opened up

it
