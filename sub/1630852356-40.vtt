We're aware.
It'll be right next door.

Actually, it will be
on both sides of your house.

But that would mean...

Sorry, dudes. Chip bought
our whole apartment complex.

I can find a way to stop you.

Yup. They build fast here.

No! It can't be!

08:46.743 --> 08:49.703
[sighs] Today's gonna be
a good day!

08:49.746 --> 08:51.748
- Betrayal!
- [screaming]

08:51.792 --> 08:54.055
- What's going on?!
- Don't play dumb.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.100
You've been on Chip's side
since day one.

08:56.144 --> 08:59.234
Our whole friendship is a lie,
isn't it?! Isn't it?! Aah!

08:59.277 --> 09:01.062
Master Remy, are you OK?

09:01.105 --> 09:03.412
I knew that boy
would go rabid one day.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.413
[hisses]

09:04.456 --> 09:05.980
Everyone, stop yelling!

09:06.023 --> 09:07.416
You're stressing me out!

09:07.459 --> 09:10.114
[sighs] Cricket,
I've never betrayed you.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.420
What are you talking about?

09:11.463 --> 09:13.204
I'm talkin' about your signature

09:13.248 --> 09:15.598
bein' on Chip's petition
to demolish our house!

09:15.642 --> 09:18.470
Oh, my gosh! Your house
is being destroyed?!

09:18.514 --> 09:20.734
- Also, who's Chip?
- Don't play dumb.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.300
Your name is right here!

09:22.344 --> 09:25.303
I didn't sign any petition.
This must be fake.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.002
Well, if that's true,
that means Chip lied to us.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.004
Oh, actually,
that makes a lot of sense.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.833
Well, if my signature is fake,
maybe they're all fake!

09:32.876 --> 09:34.617
This is a lotta
crazy information.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.011
- We've gotta tell my mom.
- Betrayal!

09:37.054 --> 09:39.143
You've been on Chip's side
since day one!

09:39.187 --> 09:41.450
- Tilly, he's clean.
- Oh, sorry, Remy.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.452
[Cricket]
Psst, Mom, over here!

09:43.495 --> 09:44.932
It's us, your children!

09:44.975 --> 09:46.368
We need your help!

09:46.411 --> 09:47.543
What's goin' on, kids?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.197
And how'd you get up there?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.241
No time to explain!

09:51.808 --> 09:53.723
Mom, we think
the petition is fake!

09:53.767 --> 09:55.246
But what should we do about it?

09:55.290 --> 09:58.380
Usin' a fake petition, huh?
[scoffs] Figures.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.034
You're gonna need proof.
Our best bet

10:00.077 --> 10:02.776
is Chip's office computer.
If you can find evidence

10:02.819 --> 10:05.169
and show it to the mayor,
he'll have to call off

10:05.213 --> 10:08.346
Chip's plan!
Uh, Cricket? You OK, kiddo?

10:08.390 --> 10:11.045
[straining] Yep. Just need
to jostle up the juices.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.003
Vasquez? [exclaiming]

10:13.047 --> 10:15.353
[gasps] OK, evidence, got it.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.051
But what if it backfires?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.096
We don't wanna
make things worse for you!

10:19.140 --> 10:22.012
Hey, don't worry about me.
It hurts to be away from y'all,

10:22.056 --> 10:23.927
but it would hurt even more
to just stand by

10:23.971 --> 10:25.320
while some dingleberry like Chip

10:25.363 --> 10:27.104
tramples all over
the people I love.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.933
If we go down,
at least we go down swingin'.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.021
[both]
Mm-hmm!

10:35.722 --> 10:38.159
- [sighs] Oh! Huh?
- [rumbling]

10:38.202 --> 10:41.075
- [rumbling intensifies]
- [gasps] Oh, no.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.947
<i>Sorry, but I just couldn't
wait till morning.</i>

10:43.991 --> 10:47.037
<i>I'll be tearing down your
house precisely at midnight.</i>

10:47.081 --> 10:48.648
<i>Tick-tock, Greens.</i>

10:48.691 --> 10:50.650
Tick. Tock.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.565
Oh, my gosh!

10:53.609 --> 10:54.630
Chip's gonna bulldoze the house!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.046
That termite showed up early!

10:56.090 --> 10:56.960
<i>Green family,</i>

10:57.004 --> 10:59.397
<i>you have eight</i> minutos

10:59.441 --> 11:01.312
<i>to vacate the premises!</i>

11:01.356 --> 11:03.053
- Dad! [panting]
- Kids!

11:03.097 --> 11:05.839
Great news, Dad! We've got
a plan to save the house!

11:05.882 --> 11:08.058
- Exciting, right?
- What? No!

11:08.102 --> 11:09.973
The only plan we have
is to get our stuff

11:10.017 --> 11:11.845
and get out of here
before we lose everything!

11:11.888 --> 11:13.629
Now, come on!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.110
OK, Dad's not thinkin' straight.
Group huddle!

11:16.153 --> 11:18.547
OK, Remy and I are gonna sneak
into Wholesome Foods

11:18.590 --> 11:20.046
and get the evidence
to prove that Chip

11:20.070 --> 11:21.419
faked the petition.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.743
But Gramma, we need
you and Tilly

11:22.769 --> 11:24.074
to buy us some time. Got it?

11:24.118 --> 11:26.686
Buying time...

11:26.729 --> 11:28.078
is my specialty.

11:28.122 --> 11:32.300
[sighs] Come on!
Eh, it's midnight somewhere.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.868
<i>It's go time, boys!</i>

11:34.911 --> 11:37.218
- [evil laughter]
- [engines revving]

11:37.261 --> 11:39.960
What are you waitin' for?
Get a move on!

11:40.003 --> 11:42.919
- Ready for some fun, Till?
- Aye-aye, captain.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.008
I spent all day
preparin' for this.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.271
Time to sit back
and enjoy the show.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.799
- [workers screaming]
- Whoa!

11:52.842 --> 11:55.279
What?! Are you kidding me?!

11:55.323 --> 11:57.412
- That oughta hold 'em off
for a while!
- Yeah!

11:57.455 --> 11:59.457
[grunting] Dang it.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.590
The automatic doors won't open.
We're locked out.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.983
How are we gonna get in?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.376
Hmm... [gasps] I got it!

12:05.420 --> 12:07.117
[both grunting]

12:07.161 --> 12:08.292
C'mon.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.294
[both exclaiming]

12:12.166 --> 12:13.384
[gasps]

12:16.823 --> 12:19.129
[both whimpering quietly]

12:19.173 --> 12:21.088
- [radio static]
- Hm?

12:21.131 --> 12:23.531
The children have been spotted
outside the doors. Let's move.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.963
- Just as planned.
- That was a close one.

12:27.007 --> 12:30.793
That's gotta be the elevator
to Chip's office!

12:30.837 --> 12:34.057
Uh-oh! We need a keycard
to operate the elevator!

12:34.101 --> 12:36.712
Oh, Remy, there goes college.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.887
Cricket?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.802
Gloria? This is perfect!

12:39.846 --> 12:41.586
We need your keycard
to use the elevator!

12:41.630 --> 12:45.025
No way, dude. I'm not losing
another job because of you.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.723
Gloria, please,
my family needs your help.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.551
I know we've
had our differences,

12:49.594 --> 12:51.771
but think of all the times
the Greens have helped you

12:51.814 --> 12:54.077
or just made your life
a little better.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.993
Haven't we been there for you
when you needed us?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.473
[groans]

12:58.516 --> 13:00.257
Gloria, you're a real peach.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.955
Chip's office is on floor seven.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.434
Hold it right there!

13:03.478 --> 13:05.175
Don't move an inch.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.047
- Yikes!
- Go. Don't worry about me.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.223
- I know <i>Tae Kwon Do.</i>
- What's that?

13:09.266 --> 13:12.443
- [growls]
- Purple belt,
don't fail me now!

13:12.487 --> 13:15.969
[groans] So I guess this means
I'm fired, huh?

13:16.012 --> 13:18.623
- [grunts]
- Eh. Down we go!

13:18.667 --> 13:21.191
[both screaming, grunting]

13:21.235 --> 13:24.194
Success! Ooh!
Ow, ow, ow! Glass.

13:24.238 --> 13:28.068
<i>Come on, people!
Get these bulldozers moving!</i>

13:28.111 --> 13:31.027
Ugh, useless!
Runners, you're up!

13:31.071 --> 13:33.160
- [screaming]
- Let's go, go, go, go!

13:33.203 --> 13:36.163
-Gramma!
-Stay calm!
Time for phase two.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.164
Notch!

13:37.207 --> 13:40.080
[all screaming, grunting]

13:41.211 --> 13:42.647
What in the world?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.998
OK, let's give
these doors a try!

13:47.391 --> 13:49.959
So, I dunno, Cricket, you think
this is Chip's office?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.221
[snorts]

13:51.265 --> 13:53.876
OK, let's search
for that petition.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.182
[Cricket]
A password, huh?

13:55.225 --> 13:56.966
Maybe I can make
an educated guess!

13:57.010 --> 13:59.664
Let's see, uh...
"I hate Cricket."

13:59.708 --> 14:02.450
- [negative beep]
- Maybe "Cricket's
a dumb doo-doo baby."

14:02.493 --> 14:04.060
- [beeping continues]
- Uh...

14:04.104 --> 14:06.149
"Cricket's not smart
or popular 1-2-3."

14:06.193 --> 14:07.735
Uh, maybe it's time
to try somethin' else.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.936
"Cricket is a peanut-brain
garbage goblin."

14:09.979 --> 14:11.261
- OK, that's enough.
- [positive ding]

14:11.285 --> 14:14.070
Hey, it worked! We're in!

14:15.158 --> 14:17.073
Shield formation!

14:18.901 --> 14:20.076
Aw, rats!

14:20.120 --> 14:22.035
Oh, no!
The family's in trouble!

14:22.078 --> 14:25.125
Oh! I know someone
who can help! Code red!

14:25.168 --> 14:28.041
[all grunting]

14:28.084 --> 14:30.130
Ready to help, Master Remy!

14:30.173 --> 14:32.915
Ha-ha-ho! Those goons
are so dead.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.439
The Greens are Master Remy's
dearest friends!

14:35.483 --> 14:37.311
Anyone who tries
to mess with them

14:37.354 --> 14:39.530
has to deal with Vasquez.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.315
Well, hubbity bubbity!

14:41.358 --> 14:46.233
Can we focus on taking down
the human death machine, please?

14:46.276 --> 14:49.062
[all screaming]

14:49.105 --> 14:51.325
Ha-ha. Foolish.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.848
- [both grunt]
- Mrs. Green!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.284
That's right! Can't let you

14:54.328 --> 14:56.069
have all the fun, hot shot!

14:56.112 --> 14:57.635
[both growl]

14:57.679 --> 14:58.941
Go, guys, go!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.073
- [groaning]
- Hm?

15:00.116 --> 15:01.857
Whew!

15:01.901 --> 15:02.989
Hm.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.165
What the...? Tilly!

15:05.208 --> 15:06.166
What are you doin'?

15:06.209 --> 15:07.950
Puttin' everything back!

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
Tilly, please,
you gotta understand,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.998
I'm trying to do
what's best for the family.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.522
I need to get you away
from all this craziness.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.611
[tires squealing]

15:16.654 --> 15:19.179
<i>Channel 11 News,</i>
reporting for duty!

15:19.222 --> 15:21.790
We heard there was
a crisis to exploit!

15:21.833 --> 15:23.574
Maria Media here
at the site of the new

15:23.618 --> 15:26.664
Wholesome Foods Mega Center,
where a civil dispute

15:26.708 --> 15:28.797
has turned into
an all-out brawl.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.756
And among the chaos,
a family in crisis.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.125
Tilly, look around.
This is happening

15:33.149 --> 15:35.369
whether we like it or not.
The way I see it,

15:35.412 --> 15:37.588
we can move forward
like we always have,

15:37.632 --> 15:40.417
or we can stay
and fight a losing battle.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.985
But Papa, the battle isn't lost.

15:43.029 --> 15:46.162
When we stand up for ourselves,
it makes a difference.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.991
Just like Mama did when she
freed those dairy cows!

15:49.035 --> 15:50.645
And what difference did it make?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.821
We still lost the farm,
and she went to jail!

15:52.864 --> 15:54.451
She shouldn't have fought
a losing battle.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.346
Well, I'm glad she did!

15:56.390 --> 15:58.020
This is getting good!
Get it, get it, get it!

15:58.044 --> 16:00.742
Mama knew the risks,
but she couldn't stand by

16:00.785 --> 16:02.874
while our family
was under attack.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.486
<i>And now, the Green family
is under attack again!</i>

16:05.529 --> 16:07.444
<i>Maybe we are
just the little guys,</i>

16:07.488 --> 16:10.186
<i>but if we stand together
as a family,</i>

16:10.230 --> 16:13.015
<i>we have a real chance
to turn things around.</i>

16:13.059 --> 16:16.018
<i>And I won't give up on our
home while there's still a chance.</i>

16:16.062 --> 16:19.108
Isn't our family
worth fightin' for?

16:19.152 --> 16:21.893
- I...
- Ugh! This is
taking too long!

16:21.937 --> 16:25.027
- Send in the riders!
- [gasps] Mm.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.246
- [blows fanfare]
- [rumbling]

16:26.289 --> 16:27.247
What in the world?!

16:27.290 --> 16:28.509
What the heck is...?

16:29.945 --> 16:30.902
[both yelp]

16:30.946 --> 16:32.165
What do we do, Papa?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.036
Papa, come back!

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
Hold on, we're comin'! Aah!

16:37.953 --> 16:40.825
I'm not lettin' anybody
touch our house!

16:40.869 --> 16:42.088
And neither am I!

16:43.741 --> 16:45.091
That didn't even slow them down.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.267
That's all right.
Wasn't supposed to.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.312
[chickens clucking]

16:50.879 --> 16:53.142
[all screaming]

16:53.186 --> 16:57.059
Aah! My eyes!
My soft, vulnerable eyes!

16:57.103 --> 16:59.888
Avenge us, brothers!

16:59.931 --> 17:01.716
[all growling]

17:01.759 --> 17:04.501
Stand back, Tilly.
It's time I defended our home.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.720
Really, Papa?

17:05.763 --> 17:06.982
Well, you were right, Till.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.332
I wanted to move on.
[exclaiming]

17:09.376 --> 17:10.942
Because I was afraid
of losing something

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
important again.
But even if that does happen...

17:13.119 --> 17:15.034
[both grunting]

17:15.077 --> 17:18.167
...at least... [screaming]

17:18.211 --> 17:20.082
...we won't go down
without a fight!

17:20.126 --> 17:22.476
- All right, Papa!
- Attaboy, Bill!

17:22.519 --> 17:23.781
[both grunting]

17:23.825 --> 17:24.826
Now, come on, you.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.480
- [screaming]
- Charge!

17:26.523 --> 17:28.960
- Come get me.
- Come on, fight!

17:29.004 --> 17:30.745
What kind of
construction workers are you?

17:30.788 --> 17:33.095
Mr. Whistler! Sir!
Two small children

17:33.139 --> 17:35.706
have entered the office level.
I was unable to stop them.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.057
They're gonna find everything.
You. You're fired.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.408
Goons! You're with me!
I'm done playing.

17:43.192 --> 17:47.153
Stay strong, family.
Oh! I should be there!

17:47.196 --> 17:50.112
Good golly! Your family
is going to lose their house?!

17:50.156 --> 17:52.158
Yes, and I wish
I could be there to help.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.508
Oh, this puts me
in a tough spot.

17:54.551 --> 17:55.987
I don't want
your family to leave.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.120
You're my favorite people
to police.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.600
Keys, please!

17:59.643 --> 18:01.254
Hmm...

18:01.297 --> 18:04.779
Gavel, gavel,
your sentence is overruled!

18:04.822 --> 18:06.041
Now, let's get you home!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.130
Not before we get the mayor.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.566
Boy, you ask
for a lot of favors.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.046
I like it!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.004
Remy, how's
the clickity clack goin'?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.572
- [beep]
- [gasps] Actually,
I think I just found

18:15.616 --> 18:16.660
what we were looking for.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.227
In English, Remy!

18:18.271 --> 18:19.968
Cricket, look!
All the signatures

18:20.011 --> 18:22.013
are from the same IP address.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.233
If everyone in Big City
really signed this,

18:24.277 --> 18:25.974
these numbers
should all be different.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.107
Which means the petition
was faked!

18:28.150 --> 18:29.804
Not just my name, all of them!

18:29.847 --> 18:31.849
This is the proof we needed!
All we have to do

18:31.893 --> 18:35.070
is show this to the mayor!
Holy moly, bud, you did it!

18:35.114 --> 18:38.073
Wait. That means our neighbors
and the people of Big City

18:38.117 --> 18:41.207
don't actually hate us.
Booyah.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.166
- All done!
- [Chip] Bravo.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.996
Ya little scamps.
Now, gimme, gimme.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.040
Cricket, run!

18:49.084 --> 18:50.433
- After him!
- [Remy] Wait!

18:50.477 --> 18:53.088
I've got something to say.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.092
Has anyone seen my daddy?
[sobs] I've looked all over,

18:57.136 --> 19:01.444
but I can't find him,
and I... I'm really scared!

19:01.488 --> 19:03.248
- Aw, it's all right,
little guy.
- We'll help him!

19:03.272 --> 19:05.274
Do you remember anything else
about your papa?

19:05.318 --> 19:08.147
We have a very brave boy
looking for his papa over here.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.714
Repeat, the bravest, best boy.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.021
You guys!
It's clearly a trick!

19:13.064 --> 19:15.850
Wait. Where's the...?
Cricket.

19:15.893 --> 19:18.069
Time to finish this.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.984
[gasps] They just keep comin'!

19:20.028 --> 19:21.769
- [banging]
- Huh? No!

19:24.337 --> 19:26.121
- [both straining]
- Finally!

19:26.165 --> 19:27.557
Bulldozers are clear!

19:29.951 --> 19:30.952
[police siren]

19:32.475 --> 19:33.476
Oh, man...

19:33.520 --> 19:35.174
Right this way, Mr. Mayor!

19:35.217 --> 19:37.437
Now, you guys,
what's the big idea

19:37.480 --> 19:39.482
of waking me up
in the middle of the night?

19:39.526 --> 19:42.006
I was having
the most wonderful dream!

19:42.050 --> 19:44.748
Mayor, please, call off
Chip and his goons.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.837
I'm sorry,
but I can't do anything

19:46.881 --> 19:48.187
because of the petition.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.537
But Mayor, the petition
is a fake!

19:50.580 --> 19:52.669
Well, that would
certainly change things.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.018
But where's the proof?

19:54.062 --> 19:56.499
[grunting, panting]

19:56.543 --> 19:58.501
[coughing]

19:59.502 --> 20:01.200
Listen up, everybody!

20:01.243 --> 20:03.724
- [shouting] Hey! Hey!
- Cricket?

20:03.767 --> 20:06.030
Now, I need y'all
to listen real hard!

20:06.074 --> 20:08.076
You can't demolish our house!

20:08.119 --> 20:11.079
Because Chip's petition
is fake, and here's the proof...

20:11.122 --> 20:12.559
Aah! No, no, no, no, no!

20:14.082 --> 20:17.955
Oopsie! Did my new chopper
get in the way?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.305
[shocked muttering]

20:19.348 --> 20:21.089
Hm. Well,
that was interesting.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.178
Don't know what those
silly papers were all about,

20:23.222 --> 20:25.136
but you're just going
to have to accept

20:25.180 --> 20:28.314
that the majority of this city
wants your house destroyed!

20:28.357 --> 20:30.098
[citizens of Big City]
No, we don't!

20:32.927 --> 20:34.537
[Mayor gasps]
My citizens!

20:34.581 --> 20:37.279
We've been watching everything
on the news, Mr. Mayor.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.194
You can't get rid of the Greens!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.762
But I thought you all wanted
the Greens to go!

20:41.805 --> 20:43.894
We might not always get along.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.331
They may be weird...

20:45.374 --> 20:46.680
And stinky...

20:46.723 --> 20:48.116
[all]
But none of that matters,

20:48.159 --> 20:50.553
because they're
really nice people!

20:50.597 --> 20:53.121
We want the Greens to stay!

20:53.164 --> 20:57.081
Oh, boy!
Everyone's mad at me!

20:57.125 --> 20:59.301
Oh, how am I gonna fix this?

20:59.345 --> 21:01.347
By doin' what you
do best, Mayor.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.174
Making people happy.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.133
Ahh!

21:05.176 --> 21:08.049
<i>People of Big City,
your mayor hears you.</i>

21:08.092 --> 21:10.225
<i>The Greens' house
will not be destroyed,</i>

21:10.269 --> 21:13.097
<i>and Wholesome Foods
has to put everything back</i>

21:13.141 --> 21:14.708
<i>the way it was!</i>

21:14.751 --> 21:16.318
All right, you heard the mayor.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.580
Pack it up, boys.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.016
Oh, uh... sorry.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.323
Uh... I'll fix that, ma'am.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.194
<i>Chip, I'm sorry to say,</i>

21:23.238 --> 21:26.067
<i>but you are hereby banned
from Big City.</i>

21:26.110 --> 21:28.069
What?! You can't ban me!

21:28.112 --> 21:30.158
Our house is saved!

21:30.201 --> 21:31.942
Yeah! We did it!

21:31.986 --> 21:34.815
Cricket Green,
you've made a fool of me

21:34.858 --> 21:36.773
for the last time!

21:37.774 --> 21:39.428
- [both] Cricket!
- Oh, boy.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.518
This had better work!

21:42.562 --> 21:44.259
- Aah!
- [screaming]

21:45.565 --> 21:46.783
[screaming]

21:46.827 --> 21:48.481
- [all gasp]
- [screaming]

21:48.524 --> 21:50.309
Somebody better catch me!

21:50.352 --> 21:52.223
- I got you, boy!
- [screaming, grunts]

21:52.267 --> 21:54.617
- All my decisions
are good ones!
- [helicopter approaches]

21:56.750 --> 22:00.188
Now I can get rid
of all the Greens at once!

22:00.231 --> 22:02.799
[evil laughter]

22:02.843 --> 22:04.279
Come and get me, chicken!

22:04.323 --> 22:06.586
[evil laughter]

22:06.629 --> 22:08.065
[grunts]

22:09.023 --> 22:11.678
[groaning] No...

22:11.721 --> 22:13.506
Well, Chip, looks like
you're the one

22:13.549 --> 22:15.072
who doesn't belong in Big City.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.615
- Why, you... Oh.
- [helicopter rumbling]

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
Bingo. Bango.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.078
[Chip screaming]

22:21.122 --> 22:24.081
And that's how you launch
a chicken into space.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.697
It's really startin'
to feel like home again.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.135
Mm.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.182
[sighs] No more bulldozers,
no more Chip.

22:38.226 --> 22:41.403
Yep! Good to have everything
exactly back to the way it was!

22:41.447 --> 22:42.447
[car approaching]

22:44.667 --> 22:46.103
[groaning]

22:46.147 --> 22:47.801
Oh, hey, Gloria!
Good to see ya!

22:47.844 --> 22:49.803
What are ya doin'?

22:49.846 --> 22:52.849
Well, I lost both of my jobs
because of this crazy family,

22:52.893 --> 22:55.025
and I can't afford to live
in my apartment anymore,

22:55.069 --> 22:56.810
so I'll be living here
for a while.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.029
And I don't want to hear
anything about it.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.685
Is she serious?

23:02.729 --> 23:04.383
Uh... I think so.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.909
<i>♪ I got sweat in my eyes</i>

23:08.952 --> 23:12.042
