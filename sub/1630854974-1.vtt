WEBVTT

00:21.480 --> 00:22.523
Is here good?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.982
That works.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.067
Okay.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.664
What happens when the corporations
that control our world

00:38.664 --> 00:41.917
tell us we have to go to 2.1, 2.2?

00:43.168 --> 00:44.169
We can't.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.963
Is there anything you need?

00:47.339 --> 00:48.465
For people to listen.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.221
Hologram going live in three, two...

00:55.639 --> 00:58.600
I was born in 2015,

00:58.600 --> 01:02.020
when the world went to Paris
and was issued a warning.

01:02.813 --> 01:07.901
<i>Scientists told us way back then
that if the average temperature on Earth</i>

01:07.901 --> 01:11.488
<i>increased beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius,</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:14.950
<i>there would be devastating consequences.</i>

01:16.159 --> 01:19.121
<i>And they were right. Just look around.</i>

01:20.289 --> 01:22.958
<i>Today is July 16th, 2037.</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:26.587
The highly anticipated
climate change meeting, COP42,

01:26.587 --> 01:30.883
continues today in Israel
amidst urgent cries for action and hope--

01:30.883 --> 01:34.595
<i>Yet here we are in 2037</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:38.515
<i>considering the possibility
of an increase of 2 degrees.</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.142
No!

01:40.142 --> 01:43.729
World markets posted record gains today,

01:43.729 --> 01:48.025
with demand for batteries
and pharmaceuticals leading the way...

01:48.025 --> 01:50.569
<i>But what happens after two?</i>

01:51.195 --> 01:55.949
<i>What happens when the corporations
that are destroying our world</i>

01:55.949 --> 01:57.868
<i>say that our economies will fail</i>

01:57.868 --> 02:03.207
<i>if we don't allow the temperatures to rise
by 2.1 or 2.2 degrees?</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:08.419
Nick Bilton, CEO of Alpha Industries,

02:08.419 --> 02:12.925
is rumored to have invested in a new
casino project above the Arctic Circle.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.678
Wherever the future leads,
we know we're going there together.

02:16.678 --> 02:21.016
Bilton's partner in the enterprise is
none other than controversial developer,

02:21.016 --> 02:22.142
you-know-who.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.604
<i>Friends,
Nick Bilton is not coming to save us.</i>

02:25.604 --> 02:26.730
No!

02:26.730 --> 02:29.233
<i>We must save ourselves.</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:36.490
<i>Inside that building right now, the powers
that be are negotiating your future.</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:41.870
<i>But you can't negotiate with a fire.</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:44.831
<i>Or a flood.</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:47.876
<i>Or a famine.</i>

03:15.279 --> 03:21.702
<i>If we go to 2, it's the end of me and you!</i>

03:30.252 --> 03:34.214
A priest, a rabbi and an imam
are all fishing together on a boat

03:34.214 --> 03:35.841
in the middle of a lake.

03:35.841 --> 03:39.011
And the priest realizes
he left his fishing rod in the car.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.890
So the priest, he turns to his colleagues,
and he says, "Hey, I'll be right back."

03:42.890 --> 03:46.852
He gets out of the boat.
He walks across the water to the beach.

03:46.852 --> 03:51.940
He goes to the car. He gets back
across the water and gets into the boat.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.444
The rabbi is amazed.
The priest just walked on water.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.697
About 30 minutes later, the imam says,
"I have to go to the toilet."

03:58.697 --> 04:03.994
So, he stands up, steps out of the boat,
walks across the water to the beach,

04:03.994 --> 04:07.748
finds the nearest men's room, walks back
across the water and gets into the boat.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.917
The rabbi stares dumbfounded.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.462
But he thinks, "Well,
my faith is at least as strong as theirs."

04:13.462 --> 04:16.339
So, he says, "I'm a little thirsty.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.510
There's a snack bar
over there on the beach. Excuse me."

04:19.510 --> 04:23.847
He stands up, puts his feet in the water.
Splash. Sinks like a stone.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.933
- And then he--
- I told you that joke. That's my joke.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.392
I love that joke.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.145
And it's "refreshment stand,"
not "snack bar."

04:30.145 --> 04:33.607
Are you sure you wanna make jokes
your first day as a rabbi?

04:33.607 --> 04:36.276
Yeah. Well, first of all,
rabbis are supposed to tell jokes.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.404
And secondly,
it's a perfect description of the job.

04:39.404 --> 04:43.158
That's what I'm doing. I'm helping people
find a way through difficult passages.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.618
That's what I do at the center.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.120
How are you helping people with no homes

04:47.120 --> 04:50.541
by sending them to other places
where they have no homes?

04:50.541 --> 04:54.211
Dad, it's not their fault
they don't have homes. It's-- They were--

04:54.211 --> 04:55.712
I gotta get this.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.298
- Hello, Junior.
- They were displaced.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.466
Are you there yet?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.385
Marshall, how long has it been like this?

05:01.385 --> 05:03.345
I can barely breathe in this air.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
So much smoke from the looting.

05:09.601 --> 05:14.314
No, Ma. There's no looting.
That's forest fires in Eshtaol and Tzora.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.694
When you were born,
we planted trees there in your honor.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.196
I was hoping to go.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.533
Well, maybe if you guys come back
and visit for the holidays,

05:24.533 --> 05:27.452
the fires will be out and I can take you.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.915
So, you're staying here?
That's what you've decided?

05:31.915 --> 05:34.543
Yes, Ma. I told you, I wanna stay.

05:34.543 --> 05:39.631
I know. And I'm telling you,
your father has other expectations.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.846
There are laws, Junior.
That's all I'm saying.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.933
If the land is designated as protected,
then there could be issues.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.310
<i>I have it on good authority</i>

05:51.310 --> 05:56.106
there will be exemptions
on this protected lands bullshit.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.524
<i>How do you know?</i>

05:58.650 --> 06:03.071
How do I know? I have an app
on my phone that tells me the future.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.908
Don't be such a--
What do you call it? A <i>putz</i>.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.576
<i>If Mr. Bilton knows something ab--</i>

06:07.576 --> 06:11.622
No, I don't wanna discuss it on this line,
or any line, or email.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.708
I'm gonna be back in Miami on Friday.
I can see you then.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.003
Look, I wouldn't be here if Bilton
didn't want this to happen. Goodbye.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.463
<i>I'm not back till Mon--</i>

06:20.506 --> 06:22.466
- Where is that?
- What?

06:22.466 --> 06:25.219
Outside. That doesn't look like Russia.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.931
It just says, "tropical."
I mean, I'm not even sure it exists.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.396
Oh, shit! Look at it out there.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.940
It's from the forest fire in Ozera.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.609
The firemen just quit over wages,
and it's burning out of control.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.154
750,000 acres.
That is happening right now.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.114
Well then, good thing we're leaving.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.700
Is there any special song
you want me to sing tomorrow?

06:48.700 --> 06:52.329
Yes. One that makes people
wanna give me their money.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.583
<i>Protests have erupted in major cities</i>

06:56.583 --> 07:00.254
<i>across Europe and the US today
over the perceived lack of progress</i>

07:00.254 --> 07:02.339
<i>at the Tel Aviv climate talks.</i>

07:02.339 --> 07:05.884
<i>Issues on the table at Tel Aviv
include strengthening prohibitions</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:08.428
<i>against development in protected areas.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:10.222
Could you turn this shit off?

07:14.601 --> 07:17.771
Namaste<i>, Hannah. Shall we begin?</i>

07:35.956 --> 07:39.585
Okay. Give me a minute.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.253
No, we gotta keep going, Becca.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.213
Why the fuck did I do this?

07:43.213 --> 07:46.717
Get pregnant or take a job counting ravens
in the middle of the woods?

07:46.717 --> 07:50.137
Maybe this is nature's way of telling us
to stop making babies.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.055
Still an hour to the evac spot. Come on.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.474
Shit. You were right.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.727
We should've left yesterday.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.854
Hey.
It's not your fault the wind shifted.

08:02.941 --> 08:03.942
Great. It's Omar.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.570
Are you gonna answer it?

08:06.570 --> 08:07.696
And say what?

08:08.197 --> 08:09.448
Sorry, I can't talk right now,

08:09.448 --> 08:12.659
I'm in the middle of a forest fire
with your unborn son.

08:15.913 --> 08:16.914
Come on.

08:32.471 --> 08:36.099
Germany and Italy are
losing crops to drought and infestation.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.602
Austria and Poland are dealing
with nationalist movements.

08:39.602 --> 08:43.315
Raising the number of people
the EU is willing to take in right now

08:43.315 --> 08:44.983
is a hard ask.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.611
We need to focus on temperature.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.072
So where do you suggest
we tell our people to go?

08:50.072 --> 08:51.365
They have no water.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.076
I think we'd all prefer
to solve the problems

08:54.076 --> 08:56.578
that make people leave their homes
in the first place.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.788
Agreed.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.541
The goal here is consensus on temperature.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.335
Keeping it below 2 degrees is critical.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.004
If the temperature goes up
2 degrees or 10 degrees,

09:06.004 --> 09:08.215
it doesn't matter if you have no water.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.843
You catch more flies with honey.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.136
Who are you right now?

09:13.136 --> 09:16.265
An Algerian or a Frenchman?

09:20.769 --> 09:22.771
We're willing to support certain proposals

09:22.771 --> 09:26.900
related to temperature and carbon
as long as our basic needs are guaranteed.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.695
Can you elaborate
on the term "basic needs"?

09:29.695 --> 09:31.905
Unlimited refuge in Europe?

09:34.199 --> 09:36.952
Water.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.454
We'd like access to state of the art

09:39.454 --> 09:42.207
desalinization
and purification technology.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.917
And what do you mean by "access"?

09:43.917 --> 09:47.504
The patents and designs developed
by Alpha Hydro Solutions.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.885
You think Nicholas Bilton
is going to just give you his patents

09:52.885 --> 09:54.678
because we ask nicely?

09:55.345 --> 09:58.182
Okay. Drought leads to instability.

09:58.182 --> 10:02.853
Look at Sudan in '24. Cape Town in '27.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.938
Look at the west. Argentina, 2033--

10:04.938 --> 10:08.025
Look here.
We have made such progress in the region.

10:08.025 --> 10:11.445
Israel and a Palestinian state
are living side by side in peace,

10:11.445 --> 10:13.447
but it can still all unravel so fast.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.907
Is that a threat?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.825
A threat?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.496
No, it's an invitation.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.462
I have to take that call. Okay?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.299
We need water.

10:34.676 --> 10:38.305
Mr. Bilton
does not give things away for free,

10:38.305 --> 10:42.392
so we need to be prepared
for what he will ask for in return.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.898
We have 3,000 reservations already.
Did I tell you who's doing the interiors?

10:48.690 --> 10:51.360
- You said Kanye. Still Kanye?
- Yeah! Yeah.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.283
I put together a schedule.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.328
From groundbreaking to grand opening,
nine months.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.746
A wise man once said,

11:03.247 --> 11:06.291
"What the bulldozers
and dump trucks do doesn't matter,

11:06.291 --> 11:08.502
so long as they do a lot of it."

11:08.502 --> 11:10.087
Can you believe these people?

11:10.963 --> 11:13.131
Hard to imagine they can march
with their heads up their asses.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.843
They say ice sheet in Greenland
is gonna break down the middle.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.429
- 79N ice sheet.
- Great, we'll build there next.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.683
They say three-meter sea level rise
by the end of the century.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.936
"They"?
They also said the same thing about Miami.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.272
All we did was make a fortune
retrofitting the buildings.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.941
And guess what?
When it goes up another couple of inches,

11:30.941 --> 11:33.777
we'll retro-fucking-fit again
and make even more money.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.071
Here's what you need to know
about global warmings.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.366
It will all go to shit at the end
of the century. One hundred percent.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.411
We'll be dead. We'll have to miss it,

11:42.411 --> 11:45.455
but we'll be smiling
in gold-plated coffins designed by Kanye.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.249
So, let's focus on the now.

11:47.749 --> 11:51.253
Top of the World Casino is gonna be
the best casino in the world

11:51.253 --> 11:54.673
'cause there's nothing else like it.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.217
Holy shit.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.552
Would you look at that?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.054
<i>If we go to 2...</i>

12:01.889 --> 12:04.099
Thank God. The trolls finally shut her up.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.986
So then you're planning to
keep it empty for the foreseeable future?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.405
Never mind, Marshall. Forget it.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.533
I'll go ride a bike
in the gym or something.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.743
Yes, I understand.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.162
- At least there's no soot there.
- Yes, thank you.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.539
Okay, here's the deal.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.583
With the drought and the fires,

12:29.583 --> 12:32.336
they think that filling the pool
would be insensitive.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.296
They're worried about the protests.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.882
They're using the pool water
to put out the forest fires?

12:36.882 --> 12:40.135
A Lebanese man set himself on fire
at the camp yesterday.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.970
Was he protesting me swimming laps?

12:41.970 --> 12:43.722
I know you don't follow
this kind of stuff,

12:43.722 --> 12:48.685
but a lawyer, David Buckel, in Brooklyn,
did the same thing in 2018.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.271
Self-immolated to protest climate change.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.066
- And did it work? Does it ever work?
- Define "work."

12:54.066 --> 12:58.028
It showed that the world is in pain.
That change is needed.

12:58.028 --> 13:02.032
The world is always in pain,
and it never changes.

13:02.699 --> 13:07.746
But to answer your question,
work is something you get paid for. A job.

13:07.746 --> 13:11.041
- And then there's how the world works.
- Well, I get paid in more than money.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.045
Dad, the people here need me.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.841
That's why I am planning
on staying in Israel.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.469
The people who are lighting themselves
on fire need you?

13:23.387 --> 13:27.057
Those people need psychiatric help
and fire extinguishers.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.643
- Why does nothing I say matter?
- You asked for my help.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.397
You said you wanted to be a rabbi,
so I paid for you to come here,

13:33.397 --> 13:35.816
- now you're a rabbi.
- Yes, I appreciate that.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.443
And then I set up the interview
at Temple Israel in Miami.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.487
Don't remember asking you to do that one,
but okay.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.575
I paid for the wood tick eradication
in their summer camp up in the Catskills

13:44.575 --> 13:46.577
when the Ellenberg child got ill.

13:46.577 --> 13:47.870
I appreciate that too.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.080
And because of what I did for them,

13:50.664 --> 13:54.543
they are now offering you
the position of Youth Rabbi.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.088
That's how the world works.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.516
<i>I want to speak to my wife, please.</i>

14:09.516 --> 14:11.018
Low visibility along...

14:11.018 --> 14:15.814
- Hi, baby. Bad timing, I know.
- <i>How long till they get to the hospital?</i>

14:15.814 --> 14:18.066
Let me call Dr. Kilmer to make sure--

14:18.066 --> 14:20.194
<i>She had to evacuate.
Her daughter's asthmatic.</i>

14:20.194 --> 14:23.780
<i>BP 152 over 97. Dr. Shearer,
that's higher than we'd like it to be.</i>

14:23.780 --> 14:25.032
Who was that?

14:25.032 --> 14:27.826
<i>What's happening, Becca? I'm coming.</i>

14:27.826 --> 14:30.162
No, just stay where you are, okay?

14:30.162 --> 14:31.663
- We'll...
- How far along are you?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.165
...just see what the doctor says, okay?

14:33.165 --> 14:34.750
- <i>But you just told me...</i>
- Thirty-one weeks.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.335
<i>...Dr. Kilmer isn't even there.</i>

14:36.335 --> 14:39.505
<i>They just put her on oxygen.
I'll call you as soon as we land.</i>

14:39.505 --> 14:41.298
But she's going to be okay, right?

14:42.090 --> 14:43.759
She's not in danger or anything?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.930
- Hello?
- Stop!

14:49.139 --> 14:50.140
Let me through!

14:53.143 --> 14:55.854
I am the alpha. I am the omega.

14:55.854 --> 14:59.066
I am the air that you breathe
and the water that you drink.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.318
I am Nick Bilton, and I own this planet.

15:03.237 --> 15:07.491
<i>Mr. Bilton?</i>

15:08.200 --> 15:11.995
<i>In addition to the countries
previously mentioned, Mr. Bilton,</i>

15:11.995 --> 15:17.459
<i>Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait
and Sudan would also be candidates</i>

15:17.459 --> 15:20.337
<i>for the water desalinization patents.</i>

15:20.337 --> 15:23.590
<i>The lawyers are reviewing
the legality of such an offering,</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:26.885
<i>but Alpha Hydro Solutions
wanted you to know</i>

15:26.885 --> 15:30.013
<i>that giving away the patents
would amount to a net loss</i>

15:30.013 --> 15:33.016
<i>of over 2.7 billion euros.</i>

15:34.101 --> 15:36.061
Where are we at with the Arctic?

15:36.728 --> 15:41.191
<i>The Arctic Council is open
to your proposal on underwater mining,</i>

15:41.191 --> 15:42.776
<i>pending UN approval.</i>

15:43.861 --> 15:47.364
I'd like to know the total amount of
acreage burning worldwide at this moment.

15:47.364 --> 15:51.493
And I'd like to know
what our people think of 79N

15:52.202 --> 15:57.332
and what it means for sea level change
in Mumbai, Guangzhou, and...

16:00.335 --> 16:01.628
and Miami.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.213
<i>Yes, Mr. Bilton.</i>

16:04.965 --> 16:08.468
<i>Models differ on the future
of the 79N glacier in Greenland.</i>

16:08.468 --> 16:12.890
<i>Although all agree the giant glacier is
melting due to extreme heat and friction,</i>

16:12.890 --> 16:16.768
<i>it is unclear if a catastrophic collapse
is days away, or possibly years.</i>

16:41.668 --> 16:43.170
Any idea what she's watching?

16:44.296 --> 16:46.173
Fuck if I know. She's probably shopping.

16:46.173 --> 16:50.511
If you really wanna know,
I am watching the video for my new single.

16:51.178 --> 16:55.432
It's just me
in front of a fireplace on this fur rug,

16:55.432 --> 17:00.896
and I'm wearing nothing
but whipped cream and a smile.

17:04.358 --> 17:08.945
And then in one hand I'm holding
a riding crop, and in the other, a leash.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.821
And there are these four supermodels.

17:10.821 --> 17:14.284
And there's this really nasty beat.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.993
You would like that, wouldn't you?

17:20.165 --> 17:24.670
She likes fur?
I know a guy who still gets polar bear.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.422
They have a thing in Alaska now
called a pizzly bear,

17:27.422 --> 17:29.508
comes from a grizzly bear
fucking a polar bear.

17:29.508 --> 17:32.719
A friend of mine shot one last year.
Any bears on the island?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.221
No, mainly just rocks.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.850
The construction guy says
sometimes a walrus swims by.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.518
You want me to ask about pizzly?

17:39.518 --> 17:40.519
- Walrus?
- Yeah.

17:40.519 --> 17:43.272
Maybe the casino
should offer safaris as well.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.525
It could be you with this great big bear,
waving at people,

17:46.525 --> 17:49.736
"Come to the Top of the World
and make a killing."

17:54.241 --> 17:56.994
Go ahead. Check it out. It's super hot.

18:03.417 --> 18:07.171
<i>Record heat is being blamed
for the spread of wildfires worldwide.</i>

18:07.171 --> 18:09.840
<i>Over 20 million acres have already burned
in that--</i>

18:20.225 --> 18:22.561
Just talk to me
about something. Just distract me.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.896
Okay, let me think

18:23.896 --> 18:26.607
Fuck, anything! Just--

18:26.940 --> 18:29.067
The lunch you had
with your mother last week,

18:29.067 --> 18:31.486
you never told me how that went?
How's she doing?

18:31.486 --> 18:33.030
- It never happened.
- What?

18:33.655 --> 18:35.115
I had a job interview.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.200
With who?

18:37.409 --> 18:39.203
Menagerie2100.

18:39.828 --> 18:40.954
Why would you do that?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.748
Because
everything's fucking dying around us.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.209
Please, just distract me, please.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.336
Just tell me anything.
Tell me a story. Pl--

18:47.836 --> 18:51.548
Okay. Here's a story about ravens.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.886
Long ago,
back at the beginning of the world,

18:55.886 --> 19:01.808
Gray Eagle was the guardian
of the sun and the moon and the stars.

19:02.643 --> 19:06.313
And back then,
Raven was a snow-white bird.

19:08.023 --> 19:13.529
And one day, Gray Eagle's daughter
invited Raven into her father's house.

19:14.112 --> 19:19.117
The total global population is projected
to reach nine billion this year.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.329
- Those people are the ones in need...
- Hey. I'm flying home.

19:22.329 --> 19:26.792
...of help, not the leaders of the world's
largest corporations who we must finally--

19:28.669 --> 19:31.463
Are you crazy?
You go now and you miss Bilton.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.424
We're so close. We need you here, Omar.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.759
She's at the hospital.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.427
So then she's safe, no?

19:37.427 --> 19:38.846
I need to be there.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.474
And on what planet will you
and your new family live?

19:45.644 --> 19:46.728
What are you doing?

19:47.396 --> 19:51.233
Going to be with my wife.
You can have my vote.

20:02.828 --> 20:09.877
If we go to 2, it's the end of me and you!

20:11.837 --> 20:15.299
Welcome to 80 degrees north
and 55 degrees east.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.468
Just a few years ago,
this was all covered with ice.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.095
There's really nothing up here.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.389
Exactly. That's what makes it
a great place to build.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.517
It's all the nothing you could hope for,

20:25.517 --> 20:27.936
but in a year,
you'll be able to see it from here.

20:27.936 --> 20:31.523
Ten stories, tropical gardens,
floor-to-ceiling smart windows.

20:31.523 --> 20:32.649
Let's hope.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.903
Hope? Fuck hope. Let's build.

20:37.154 --> 20:40.365
Mr. Bilton is concerned
with this ice sheet in Greenland.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.784
That's the ice sheet
I mentioned to you earlier.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.163
- Nick really see it as a problem?
- One of two problems.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.247
Two?

20:47.831 --> 20:49.291
I'll show you the other.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.252
And again, there's a splash.

20:54.171 --> 20:58.425
And as he's going down for the third time,

20:59.510 --> 21:01.803
the priest turns to the imam and says...

21:04.056 --> 21:06.183
"Do you think we should show him
where the rocks are?"

21:09.436 --> 21:11.939
I left law school a few years back

21:11.939 --> 21:16.777
because I realized that the world
didn't need another Jewish lawyer,

21:16.777 --> 21:18.529
much to the chagrin of my father.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.325
But we live in a time of crisis.

21:24.535 --> 21:25.702
Not far from here,

21:26.620 --> 21:30.290
environmentally displaced people
are in need of food and water.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.125
And rest assured,

21:32.125 --> 21:36.088
any leader who is not trying to improve
the situation is complicit.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.466
It's like Elie Wiesel said,

21:40.634 --> 21:42.928
"We must take sides.

21:43.929 --> 21:49.059
Neutrality helps the oppressor,
never the victim."

21:51.061 --> 21:53.689
<i>Controversy erupted today at COP42</i>

21:53.689 --> 21:56.859
<i>as tech tycoon Nick Bilton
was added to the list of speakers</i>

21:56.859 --> 21:58.777
<i>at the conference's closing ceremony.</i>

21:59.653 --> 22:02.781
<i>Bilton has drawn the ire
of environmental groups in the past,</i>

22:02.781 --> 22:06.660
<i>most recently over his rumored plans to
partner in a hotel development project--</i>

22:06.660 --> 22:09.079
<i>Flight 89 to Newark International Airport</i>

22:09.079 --> 22:11.331
<i>is now boarding at gate 48A.</i>

22:11.331 --> 22:12.749
<i>Last year at Davos,</i>

22:12.749 --> 22:17.129
<i>Mr. Bilton said the following about
business and environmental regulation.</i>

22:17.629 --> 22:22.176
<i>It is entirely possible that
the limits we have created for business</i>

22:22.176 --> 22:27.347
<i>are also limiting our ability
to solve the problem of climate change.</i>

22:34.730 --> 22:36.732
This is bullshit!

22:37.399 --> 22:40.194
What the hell are they doing here?

22:42.237 --> 22:44.656
My sister went through all of this
with the State Department!

22:44.656 --> 22:47.701
Ben Zucker and the lawyers
went over all of this!

22:47.701 --> 22:51.830
This is just-- This is part of the--
What the fuck is it called?

22:51.830 --> 22:54.791
The United Nations Convention for the
Law of the Seas and the Arctic Council.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.085
Right! China aren't even on the council.

22:57.085 --> 22:59.171
And last time I looked at a map,
they're nowhere near here.

22:59.171 --> 23:02.049
Actually, they have permanent
observer status on the council.

23:03.926 --> 23:06.720
You're the chair, right?
I mean, Russia runs the council.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.181
Only until the end of the year.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.475
You can see the issue right here.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.854
Our parcel is connected by an underwater
ridge to an area they claim rights to.

23:16.939 --> 23:19.066
You should really look at this.
They kind of are connected.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.651
No, they're not connected, babe,

23:20.651 --> 23:22.861
any more than Africa
and South America are connected.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.781
Although I'm sure you could find
some asshole who feels the need

23:25.781 --> 23:27.866
to put them back together like a puzzle.

23:28.784 --> 23:30.619
The Russians have been here
for years, okay?

23:30.619 --> 23:32.412
The Canadians, the Danish.

23:32.412 --> 23:36.500
Back when the US was dicking around with
the green wet dream, I was planning this.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.711
Pompeo gave a speech about it in 2019.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.256
Did someone forget
to take their meds today?

23:43.048 --> 23:46.385
Please don't tell me you woke up this
morning and decided to quit being famous

23:46.385 --> 23:48.387
so that you could become a geologist

23:48.387 --> 23:51.682
or whatever the fuck you would need to be
to know they're connected.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.725
You invited me.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.185
I'm gonna call my sister.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.991
The boat's called <i>Bing Zhànshì</i>.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.618
The "Ice Warrior."

24:11.618 --> 24:13.537
Wow. I'm impressed.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.789
You speak very well.

24:15.789 --> 24:18.333
A lot of my fans speak it.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.421
Does he?

24:23.255 --> 24:24.715
Are you kidding?

24:28.844 --> 24:29.845
Hey, it's me.

24:30.179 --> 24:32.931
You're probably asleep,
but I'm waking up to a world of shit.

24:32.931 --> 24:36.768
So, I'm up at the island, and apparently
there's a dispute with the Chinese.

24:36.768 --> 24:40.647
Someone is gonna turn a lot of profit
from these glaciers melting,

24:40.647 --> 24:42.941
and it's either gonna be the US or China.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.611
So if you are feeling patriotic,
I suggest you call me back.

24:45.611 --> 24:48.447
I need you to get in touch
with Secretary of State Rubio.

24:48.447 --> 24:51.909
Tell him I'm up at the Arctic Circle
with my pants around my ankles.

24:56.830 --> 24:57.956
Fuck!

25:00.584 --> 25:01.877
What is this?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.173
What does it say?

25:06.173 --> 25:07.716
It's Arabic for <i>mazel tov</i>.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.718
All that means <i>mazel tov</i>?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.263
Well, the rest of it
is the kids saying they love your son.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.641
- So cute.
- They're planning a party

25:15.641 --> 25:17.434
in honor of Rabbi Zucker tomorrow.

25:18.018 --> 25:22.189
Well, we're both excited to see the work
that you and Marshall have been doing.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.024
We're discussing a second facility.

25:24.024 --> 25:28.487
I think Rabbi Zucker would make
a great director of faith-based services.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.447
I'm sure he would be,

25:30.447 --> 25:33.742
but he's already accepted a position
as Youth Rabbi in Miami.

25:33.742 --> 25:37.704
Dad, I don't want to move back to Florida.
How many times do I gotta tell you?

25:37.704 --> 25:42.209
There are people in Miami, people
with whom I have long relationships with,

25:42.209 --> 25:44.169
who are offering Marshall an opportunity.

25:44.169 --> 25:48.048
You can't turn it off
for even a single moment, Ben.

25:50.259 --> 25:53.804
The joke about the rocks,
I taught him that. Excuse me.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.473
Hello, Junior.

25:57.349 --> 26:01.478
I think when he sees the work
that you've done, he'll understand.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.813
Let's hope so.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.483
- I wanna go fix my face. It's so hot here.
- Yeah.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.194
- Excuse me.
- All right, Mom.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.489
Wait, I'm confused.
You're going to Florida?

26:13.073 --> 26:13.907
Yes, sir.

26:13.907 --> 26:15.993
<i>How do I get the Chinese out of my Arctic?</i>

26:15.993 --> 26:18.871
The Chinese?
I know nothing about the Chinese.

26:18.871 --> 26:20.789
<i>Well, they're parked out in the bay,
taunting me.</i>

26:20.789 --> 26:24.459
Junior, I'm not a lawyer.
I'm just your business manager.

26:24.459 --> 26:28.714
But if they're not actually on the island,
they may be within their rights.

26:28.714 --> 26:31.008
<i>It sounds like we may have
a real problem here</i>

26:31.008 --> 26:33.260
- <i>with the Arctic Council.</i>
- Ben, Ben.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.013
You don't call Bilton with problems,
you call him with solutions,

26:36.013 --> 26:37.890
which is why I just called my sister.

26:43.312 --> 26:46.565
Yes, I know Bilton is
the richest man on earth, I do,

26:46.565 --> 26:51.528
but what I don't know is if that
puts him in a position to change treaties.

26:51.528 --> 26:56.783
Help! Somebody call a doctor!
Hurry, now. Please.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.369
<i>Ben. He's Nicholas fucking Bilton.</i>

26:59.369 --> 27:01.830
<i>He can change you and I
into poor people.</i>

27:03.373 --> 27:06.001
Mom? Mom, can you hear me?

27:06.001 --> 27:07.920
Hey, Mom, squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.421
- Hey, Mama. Mom.
- Isabel.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.131
Is somebody coming?

27:11.131 --> 27:12.841
Dad, do something!

27:13.383 --> 27:15.010
Get help! Mom!

27:15.010 --> 27:16.929
She has a pulse, Rabbi.

27:16.929 --> 27:20.140
Come on, Mom. Mom, stay with me.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.267
<i>It's all going as planned.</i>

27:22.267 --> 27:26.146
<i>He's still under the impression that you
are interested in the hotel business</i>

27:26.146 --> 27:28.148
<i>rather than what's beneath the ground.</i>

27:28.148 --> 27:29.942
<i>Quite frankly, he is clueless.</i>

27:29.942 --> 27:33.237
<i>All we need now is UN approval.</i>

27:33.237 --> 27:34.571
<i>One more thing, sir.</i>

27:34.571 --> 27:37.407
<i>Do you know if he's romantically involved
with the woman trav--</i>

27:37.616 --> 27:38.700
Delete message.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.454
<i>Chief Counsel Hampton for you.</i>

27:42.454 --> 27:43.747
Send them in.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.879
Are we really considering
waiving our patents?

27:51.672 --> 27:53.257
Have you seen what's happening?

28:00.180 --> 28:01.223
Markets, please.

28:06.270 --> 28:11.859
Nickel is up 5.6%. Cobalt up 7.7.
Copper, way up.

28:12.693 --> 28:13.986
All the base metals.

28:13.986 --> 28:17.447
You were right. It's the fires.

28:17.447 --> 28:22.411
The world is a desperate but predictable
animal. And it wants to run on batteries.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.329
That makes Tel Aviv easier.

28:25.998 --> 28:30.294
It's all just one giant, self-regulatory,
living feedback loop, isn't it?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.089
Greenland, please.

28:35.215 --> 28:38.969
And here we have our ice
turning into water. Adirondacks, please.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.471
Trees turning into fire.

28:42.848 --> 28:45.017
The solution miles from the problem.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.645
Or it's all just chaos out there.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.068
Either view presents us an opportunity.

28:57.196 --> 29:01.033
The man whose house is on fire is
incredibly easy to negotiate with, Mikey.

29:01.867 --> 29:03.493
Didn't they teach you that in law school?

29:06.997 --> 29:07.998
Time to go.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.015
Yeah, it's your brother calling again.

29:25.015 --> 29:28.560
Did you know that China has
a permanent seat on the Arctic Council?

29:28.560 --> 29:30.187
- Did you?
- Do you expect me to wear this?

29:30.187 --> 29:31.563
Call me back.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.023
- Do you?
- That depends.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.650
Do you really expect to get paid?

29:34.650 --> 29:37.861
Because if you do, let me remind you
of the deal that we both agreed on.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.905
You would dress up
as a Christmas ornament,

29:39.905 --> 29:41.490
sing your little song,
do your little dance,

29:41.490 --> 29:43.951
I stick a shovel in the ground,
we all go home.

29:43.951 --> 29:47.704
Next year, when you have
a 100-night residency at my casino,

29:47.704 --> 29:49.331
wear what the fuck you want.

29:49.331 --> 29:52.417
As long as you don't run afoul
of a global superpower.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.045
What are you doing?

29:55.045 --> 29:56.380
I wanted that one.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.633
That one?

30:01.552 --> 30:03.095
Okay. I'll get you another one.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.305
In fact, you can have any rock you want
on the fucking island

30:05.305 --> 30:06.890
as long as it fits on the plane.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.058
It was gold.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.813
- What?
- Yeah. Jordan gave it to me.

30:12.813 --> 30:15.232
He says it's everywhere,
if you know where to look for it.

30:15.232 --> 30:19.361
Gold, copper, nickel.
Yeah, and there's one other one.

30:27.995 --> 30:29.496
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

30:29.496 --> 30:32.749
I'm sorry I don't have better news.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.969
Here's what the doctor's saying, Dad.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.473
She has
a subdural hematoma from the fall. Okay?

30:50.809 --> 30:53.270
Her temporal lobe appears to be involved,

30:53.270 --> 30:55.355
so that is why she can't speak.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.151
And so far,
the extent of the damage is unclear.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.363
I'm sorry, Dad.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.538
- Dad, do you understand the--
- I'm on the phone.

31:11.538 --> 31:16.001
Just pull everything we have on
the Arctic development deal. Everything.

31:16.001 --> 31:19.671
As well as all relevant law
of the sea statutes.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.924
- Yes, and--
- Dad! Hang up the phone!

31:21.924 --> 31:26.178
Marshall! That man and his family
have been a client for 25 years!

31:26.178 --> 31:31.600
Twenty-- That woman upstairs
who can't move has been your wife for 40!

31:31.600 --> 31:34.686
What?
Marshall, where are you going? Marshall!

31:51.161 --> 31:52.454
Are you still there?

32:12.516 --> 32:14.852
<i>We may not be able to stop extinction,</i>

32:14.852 --> 32:17.396
<i>but what if we could bring
these creatures back?</i>

32:18.313 --> 32:20.858
<i>Using the latest genomic technology,</i>

32:20.858 --> 32:24.695
<i>Menagerie2100 will save
what nature cannot.</i>

32:24.695 --> 32:29.074
<i>We are committed to gene-capturing
the animals and plants you love,</i>

32:29.074 --> 32:31.118
<i>and the ones you never think about.</i>

32:32.494 --> 32:34.872
<i>We project that by the end of the century,</i>

32:34.872 --> 32:40.210
<i>Menagerie2100 will be able to maintain
a vast library of all species,</i>

32:40.210 --> 32:43.714
<i>preparing for the day when they can
be reintroduced to zoos,</i>

32:43.714 --> 32:46.466
<i>parks and someday even the w--</i>

32:51.263 --> 32:56.727
Lack of oxygen, hypoxia.
He wanted to come out.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.855
Feel like he was safer inside.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.192
He's lucky he has such a strong mother.

33:06.695 --> 33:07.696
He landed.

33:08.780 --> 33:09.907
He'll be here soon.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.744
Thank you so much for staying.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.046
Can I ask you something?

33:24.838 --> 33:25.839
Sure.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.550
On the helicopter,

33:30.010 --> 33:33.388
you said you interviewed
with Menagerie2100.

33:35.307 --> 33:37.809
So they decide what species survive?

33:38.644 --> 33:40.896
Give up on now. Hope for the future.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.816
And you wanna help with that?

33:46.610 --> 33:50.364
Come on. I mean, you see the numbers.

33:51.031 --> 33:53.367
The ravens are going away.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.993
The bees are almost gone.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.331
We're on track
to lose a third of life on Earth.

34:00.123 --> 34:02.292
Everyone wants to play God but God,
I guess.

34:03.043 --> 34:06.463
Maybe it's better than playing
funeral director for the Park Service.

34:07.589 --> 34:08.590
I don't know.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.563
The fires are spreading further north.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.732
All the way up to Whitefeather Forest.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.652
- They're evacuating Pikangikum.
- Oh, my God.

34:28.652 --> 34:31.029
My mother wants to know
where she can go that's safe.

34:32.322 --> 34:36.243
I'm not sure safe exists anymore.

34:41.456 --> 34:42.583
Here, take this.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.210
I think it helped.

34:45.918 --> 34:46.920
Keep it.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.507
Ask your friends at Menagerie
if they have a plan to bring us back.

35:02.436 --> 35:03.437
Shit.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.690
So, are we groundbreaking
or rock collecting?

35:07.733 --> 35:12.738
Nickel, copper, what was the third?
Cobalt? Was it cobalt?

35:12.738 --> 35:15.115
- I don't remember.
- Because that's why the Chinese showed up.

35:15.115 --> 35:17.367
Batteries.
That's what they want, batteries.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.119
That look like copper to you? That line?

35:19.119 --> 35:22.623
I don't know. I'm not a miner.
I'm a singer and an actress.

35:23.123 --> 35:24.124
Great.

35:24.124 --> 35:27.211
Then there's just a chance I'm wandering
around a beach staring at fucking rocks.

35:28.212 --> 35:32.007
Here's an idea,
why don't you ask somebody who knows?

35:32.007 --> 35:33.800
How come Jordan knows and you don't?

35:33.800 --> 35:37.179
Okay. So, if Jordan knows, Bilton knows.

35:37.179 --> 35:42.309
And I bet you our deal is just for
hospitality development only, not mining.

35:42.309 --> 35:44.603
Then we're out.

35:44.603 --> 35:46.438
We're just out. Lost between the laws.

35:46.438 --> 35:50.192
Just bent over by the fine print.
Castrated by contracts.

35:50.192 --> 35:53.779
'Cause who's going to stay in a hotel
with a view of a fucking copper mine?

35:56.990 --> 35:58.700
So does this mean I'm not singing?

36:01.328 --> 36:04.248
That line there, that's the heart monitor.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.252
I don't know. They seem really concerned.

36:10.796 --> 36:14.132
We knew the risks, Becca.
We are all filled with plastic now.

36:16.134 --> 36:18.053
Maybe my sperm is defective.

36:19.012 --> 36:20.597
No, I don't think this was you.

36:22.558 --> 36:24.226
I think I did this to him.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.310
Did what?

36:26.144 --> 36:27.187
He's here.

36:28.647 --> 36:31.275
I'm here. You're here.

36:34.236 --> 36:37.155
I was out in the woods saving birds.

36:39.116 --> 36:40.909
I should have been protecting him.

36:41.618 --> 36:44.705
And I left a climate summit
to be with my family.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.003
Are we bad people?

36:56.383 --> 36:59.595
I guess we can ask him when he grows up.

37:03.724 --> 37:04.725
It's okay.

37:08.395 --> 37:09.396
Okay.

37:14.359 --> 37:18.030
I called the chairman of the board
at Temple Israel in Miami.

37:18.030 --> 37:21.366
They want to introduce you officially
to the congregation

37:21.366 --> 37:22.993
- during the High Holidays.
- Dad.

37:22.993 --> 37:24.119
I bought you a ticket,

37:24.119 --> 37:26.914
but they're gonna need your
passport number and your vaccine status,

37:26.914 --> 37:30.959
- because goddamn dengue is back and--
- Dad, can you listen to me for one minute?

37:33.629 --> 37:37.174
There are people here who depend on me.

37:39.635 --> 37:41.094
You saw those kids.

37:42.054 --> 37:44.556
You have a mother who's in the hospital.

37:44.556 --> 37:46.934
She's got a brain injury.
She can't use her arms.

37:46.934 --> 37:48.769
She can't form sentences.

37:48.769 --> 37:52.022
She's gonna need a great deal of care
back in Miami.

37:52.022 --> 37:53.273
I understand.

37:53.273 --> 37:57.110
Do you? Do you, Marshall?
Do you know how much that woman loves you?

37:57.110 --> 37:59.863
Because if you did,
you would come back home with us.

37:59.863 --> 38:00.948
I love her.

38:00.948 --> 38:02.574
"Honor your father and your mother,

38:02.574 --> 38:05.702
so your days may be long upon
the land of the Lord your God gives you."

38:05.702 --> 38:09.831
Dad, what is happening right now?
You're quoting the Ten Commandments to me.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.375
Do you realize that--

38:11.375 --> 38:15.212
that she would never even have been
here walking around through the smoke

38:15.212 --> 38:17.005
if it wasn't for you?

38:23.720 --> 38:24.721
Dad.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.268
Glad she didn't have to hear you say that.

38:30.018 --> 38:34.273
I really am glad that her brain does not
have to try and make sense of that one,

38:34.273 --> 38:35.566
because mine sure can't.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.151
She needs you.

38:38.151 --> 38:39.736
You gonna answer that?

38:40.821 --> 38:41.864
Are you?

38:46.159 --> 38:47.619
I need you!

39:05.387 --> 39:06.930
I need you!

39:10.225 --> 39:12.769
The world is on fire!
And Bilton is a liar!

39:12.769 --> 39:14.605
<i>Hell is upon us, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

39:15.314 --> 39:16.899
<i>We are living in a disco inferno</i>

39:16.899 --> 39:20.110
<i>where the music is cooking
on a dance floor right beneath our feet.</i>

39:20.777 --> 39:24.323
<i>The oven below is slow and low,
and we are still not learning.</i>

39:24.323 --> 39:26.617
<i>Where did the undying yearning go?</i>

39:27.826 --> 39:29.036
<i>2 degrees.</i>

39:29.620 --> 39:33.290
<i>2 degrees will cook the fool out of you.</i>

39:34.082 --> 39:35.250
<i>What are you willing to do?</i>

39:35.250 --> 39:36.585
The world's on fire!

39:36.585 --> 39:37.961
<i>What are you willing to do?</i>

39:38.837 --> 39:40.214
<i>Net-zero now...</i>

39:40.214 --> 39:41.340
How many more?

39:41.340 --> 39:43.342
- <i>Don't give a fuck about how.</i>
- Hey, sir.

39:43.342 --> 39:45.802
- <i>Net-zero now.</i>
- Net-zero.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.638
<i>I say, save the planet somehow.</i>

39:47.638 --> 39:49.473
- What's it gonna take?
- <i>Net-zero now.</i>

39:49.473 --> 39:51.683
<i>I say, save the planet somehow.</i>

39:52.351 --> 39:54.645
<i>Or it will save itself from you.</i>

39:56.355 --> 39:58.065
<i>I spoke privately to a delegate</i>

39:58.065 --> 40:02.486
who expressed their frustration
as we enter the final evening of COP42,

40:02.486 --> 40:05.030
where the real possibility
of raising the temperature ceiling

40:05.030 --> 40:09.368
above the previously agreed upon limit
is now up for debate.

40:09.368 --> 40:12.287
Both the United States and China, as well
as Russia and India,

40:12.287 --> 40:13.580
seem open to this idea...

40:13.580 --> 40:15.457
I wanted to tell you
how I decided to vote.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.751
It's all become very complicated.

40:18.544 --> 40:22.756
What does that mean, "complicated"?
What decision did you make?

40:25.050 --> 40:26.552
I think I may have made a mistake.

40:26.552 --> 40:27.678
<i>Please make your way--</i>

40:28.971 --> 40:32.683
You need to tell me,
what decision did you make?

40:33.934 --> 40:36.645
<i>I fear I traded
the future for the present.</i>

40:37.646 --> 40:39.356
<i>I agreed to an increase.</i>

40:42.150 --> 40:46.029
The world is on fire!
And Bilton is a liar!

40:46.029 --> 40:48.782
It's done.
All parties agreed to our proposal.

40:49.283 --> 40:50.826
Exemptions for patents.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.538
You never really cared about the casino.

40:55.747 --> 40:58.041
The whole island could end up underwater.

40:58.917 --> 41:02.713
My father liked to gamble. I used to go
with him to Monaco when I was young.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.258
He thought he was so very clever
when he beat the odds.

41:06.258 --> 41:08.385
More clever, I think, to control the odds.

41:14.224 --> 41:17.769
The lawyers would like you not to mention
the Arctic mining exemptions,

41:18.478 --> 41:20.355
at least not until after the vote.

41:20.355 --> 41:24.151
Of course not. Today's not about
the exemptions. Today's about water,

41:24.151 --> 41:28.030
and how Alpha is solving the drought
and the resulting refugee problem.

41:28.530 --> 41:30.073
- Tomorrow, however--
- The world is on fire!

41:30.073 --> 41:31.700
And Bilton is a liar!

41:34.536 --> 41:35.829
Hey, Bilton!

41:35.829 --> 41:37.497
The world is on fire!
And Bilton is a liar!

41:37.497 --> 41:39.166
This is on you!

41:48.509 --> 41:49.343
Fuck.

41:51.053 --> 41:54.848
<i>When Raven saw the sun
and moon and stars and fresh water,</i>

41:55.724 --> 41:57.267
he knew what he should do.

42:00.604 --> 42:02.147
<i>He waited for his chance.</i>

42:03.482 --> 42:05.192
<i>And when no one was looking,</i>

42:06.318 --> 42:08.237
he stole all of them.

42:09.196 --> 42:10.906
And a brand of fire too.

42:14.034 --> 42:16.286
<i>It made so much light.</i>

42:17.162 --> 42:18.872
I don't know what to do, Mom.

42:22.125 --> 42:25.963
<i>That he was able to fly far out
to an island...</i>

42:29.466 --> 42:31.093
<i>in the middle of the ocean.</i>

42:33.011 --> 42:34.721
<i>And when the sun set...</i>

42:37.140 --> 42:39.601
<i>he fastened the moon up in the sky</i>

42:41.061 --> 42:43.605
<i>and hung the stars around
in different places.</i>

42:45.274 --> 42:46.275
Bullshit.

42:46.942 --> 42:48.861
And then when he flew over the land,

42:48.861 --> 42:51.572
he dropped all the water he had stolen.

42:52.906 --> 42:54.283
It fell to the ground

42:54.283 --> 42:58.829
and became the source of all the streams
and lakes in the world.

43:00.914 --> 43:02.332
And then Raven flew on.

43:03.709 --> 43:08.839
The smoke from the fire he was carrying
blew over his white feathers

43:08.839 --> 43:10.299
and turned them black.

43:11.842 --> 43:14.595
And when his bill began to burn,
he dropped the fire.

43:17.055 --> 43:21.852
Raven's feathers never were white again
once they'd been blackened by the smoke.

43:24.271 --> 43:26.523
And that is why Raven is a black bird.

43:29.693 --> 43:30.903
I like that story.

43:33.363 --> 43:36.283
It isn't mine.
I borrowed it from a friend.

43:39.578 --> 43:40.704
Bullshit.

44:00.891 --> 44:03.185
You are one lucky walrus.

44:04.186 --> 44:07.189
If I had my gun, you would be...

44:38.929 --> 44:42.349
If we go to 2, it's the end of me and you!

44:42.349 --> 44:44.601
If we go to 2, it's the end--

44:57.614 --> 44:58.782
Good evening, everyone.

44:59.741 --> 45:05.414
It is an honor to be here and to be
included in these vital conversations.

45:06.206 --> 45:08.083
Around the turn of this century,

45:08.083 --> 45:12.671
climate change was described
as a symptom of capitalism.

45:13.422 --> 45:14.464
A symptom.

45:15.549 --> 45:19.469
I am here to suggest
that capitalism is also the cure.

45:20.721 --> 45:26.643
So, today I can announce that I will make
the patents for desalinization

45:26.643 --> 45:31.899
and purification of water available to any
country that can demonstrate the need.

45:35.903 --> 45:36.945
Additionally--

45:39.198 --> 45:43.202
Additionally,
Alpha will join the Tel Aviv Accord

45:43.202 --> 45:47.080
in committing to keeping the global
temperature increase in this century

45:47.080 --> 45:50.167
as close to 2 degrees Celsius as possible.

45:50.918 --> 45:54.546
With a ceiling of 2.3 degrees.

46:07.392 --> 46:08.393
Thank you.

46:33.126 --> 46:37.005
<i>What does an increase in global
temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius</i>

46:37.005 --> 46:39.216
<i>mean to you and me?</i>

46:39.800 --> 46:41.885
<i>It means that when
the temperature goes up,</i>

46:41.885 --> 46:45.347
<i>our imagination must increase even more.</i>

46:46.473 --> 46:51.311
<i>It means that when the sea
level rises, we must rise up as well.</i>

46:52.396 --> 46:56.108
<i>It means that when forest fires
obscure the horizon</i>

46:56.108 --> 46:59.820
<i>we must look toward each other
to find our way forward.</i>

47:00.320 --> 47:04.825
<i>We cannot give up and go home
for one simple reason.</i>

47:05.576 --> 47:09.997
<i>We already are home.
This is our only home.</i>

47:16.128 --> 47:17.754
<i>We're not fucking giving up.</i>
