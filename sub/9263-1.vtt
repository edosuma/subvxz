00:05.917 --> 00:06.746
Good morning, West Texas!

00:06.985 --> 00:08.585
Slammin' Sammy Mead comin' at you

00:08.690 --> 00:10.313
with Panther Football radio!

00:10.771 --> 00:12.210
470 AM on your dial.

00:12.478 --> 00:15.064
It's Monday morning, and
we all know what that means.

00:15.225 --> 00:17.113
Only four days till Friday night.

00:17.266 --> 00:18.986
The night that our Dillon Panthers

00:19.165 --> 00:21.120
bring the hammer down
on the Westerby Mustangs.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.885
Who wants to talk Panther
football, I'm all ears.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.449
Hey, Sammy, this is
Susan from South Bain.

00:26.708 --> 00:28.998
This new coach, uh, Coach Taylor, right?

00:29.149 --> 00:29.833
Eric Taylor, that's right.

00:30.008 --> 00:31.710
Well, he... he's got himself
a lot of pressure right now,

00:31.878 --> 00:33.880
and there's lots of expectations on him,

00:34.038 --> 00:35.742
and what the heck is going on there?

00:35.895 --> 00:37.610
You got a news crew following him around

00:37.758 --> 00:38.940
every step of the preseason.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.171
Who does he think he is?

00:40.326 --> 00:41.020
Mack Brown?

00:41.177 --> 00:43.141
He's no Mack Brown,
I'll tell you right now.

00:43.326 --> 00:44.542
Well, now, Susan, I
don't think anybody is,

00:44.885 --> 00:45.903
but let me tell you something.

00:46.116 --> 00:49.310
He has stepped into the
number one team in Texas.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.190
That's right.

00:50.386 --> 00:51.783
And he does have a
news crew followin' him.

00:51.946 --> 00:53.560
I agree with you, and that's
a lot of added pressure,

00:53.717 --> 00:56.952
but it's lettin' him know
how important this football

00:57.125 --> 00:58.261
is to us here in Texas.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.800
Well, I want to add my voice to that...

00:59.975 --> 01:01.170
to that...

01:04.578 --> 01:05.950
Okay, Grandma, I made you

01:06.155 --> 01:07.302
two tuna fish sandwiches,

01:07.617 --> 01:08.551
and I put your medicine

01:08.716 --> 01:09.963
in the green Gatorade, okay?

01:10.188 --> 01:12.062
Green Gatorade, but I
only want one sandwich.

01:12.235 --> 01:13.053
Well, then just eat one.

01:13.238 --> 01:14.922
But you made two, and I just want one.

01:15.096 --> 01:16.651
No, no, no, no, I-I'll
eat the other one

01:16.845 --> 01:17.912
when I get home from practice, okay?

01:18.308 --> 01:19.433
You'll be hungry.

01:19.887 --> 01:21.202
After that good ol' practice.

01:21.495 --> 01:22.680
Yeah.

01:23.005 --> 01:24.001
You...

01:26.318 --> 01:27.412
I adore.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.301
Y'know, I think I'm gonna
get me one of those signs

01:39.488 --> 01:40.443
that say Landry Clarke:

01:40.657 --> 01:42.201
Utterly Useless.

01:42.475 --> 01:43.901
All State jerk team.

01:44.127 --> 01:45.541
Yeah, I'd probably be on that team too.

01:46.626 --> 01:51.232
Jason Street has a 72%
pass completion rate.

01:51.437 --> 01:53.501
Not only is that number
one in the state of Texas,

01:53.695 --> 01:55.591
that is number one nationally.

01:55.777 --> 01:58.483
- Are you even gonna play at all?
- Nope.

01:58.727 --> 01:59.950
Seriously, this is some kind

02:00.137 --> 02:01.263
of big misdirected

02:01.455 --> 02:02.632
"Daddy, love me" thing, ain't it?

02:03.095 --> 02:05.391
I can't keep driving
you to this practice

02:05.568 --> 02:08.020
in humiliation, it's not
good for either one of us.

02:08.247 --> 02:10.321
You're an insomniac. You're up anyway.

02:10.517 --> 02:12.092
I'm doing you a favor.

02:12.305 --> 02:13.982
You should be thanking me.

02:15.996 --> 02:17.333
Now that was mean, Matt.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.122
That wasn't nice.

02:20.575 --> 02:21.633
Gotta get up, little brother.

02:24.358 --> 02:26.723
Probably 49 players
right now. Up and at 'em.

02:27.316 --> 02:28.500
Right now, this minute.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.551
49 players on the move.

02:34.235 --> 02:36.471
Tim, they'll kick you off the team.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.141
Yup.

02:38.556 --> 02:40.151
You're a brother, don't
forget. Not a mother.

02:40.716 --> 02:41.642
You ain't that good.

02:42.918 --> 02:45.281
Twice the player you ever was, man.

02:45.876 --> 02:48.483
This is life, this isn't Maxim magazine

02:48.686 --> 02:49.971
What's that supposed to mean?

02:50.217 --> 02:52.182
Waste of time.

02:53.076 --> 02:54.302
Right.

02:57.248 --> 02:59.221
And no going out with
Jason Street this evening.

02:59.427 --> 03:01.112
We're having a family dinner tonight.

03:01.326 --> 03:04.201
That means the entire
family, dinner together.

03:04.427 --> 03:06.092
Rally rehearsal tonight.

03:06.276 --> 03:07.820
She's gonna be rehearsing
how far she can get

03:07.976 --> 03:09.733
how far she can get her tongue
into Jason Street's mouth.

03:09.886 --> 03:11.731
- Nip it.
- I love you, Daddy.

03:12.266 --> 03:13.293
Uh, love you too, baby.

03:13.816 --> 03:16.421
How you doin', Coach?
Tommy Hayskins, NBC Sports.

03:16.588 --> 03:17.331
Tommy, welcome.

03:17.556 --> 03:19.523
How's it feel to be head coach
after, what, how many years?

03:19.706 --> 03:20.613
Six years, it is.

03:20.855 --> 03:22.252
Got yourself a heck of a quarterback.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.991
He's a good boy. Very proud of him.

03:24.207 --> 03:26.730
Now, you two have been at this
together for some time, right?

03:26.897 --> 03:28.971
Yes, sir, he was my
coach all through Pee Wee,

03:29.147 --> 03:31.891
and Coach Taylor's been QB
coaching me since, uh, freshman

03:32.078 --> 03:33.392
and JV years, so it's been awhile.

03:33.555 --> 03:35.200
So, Coach, is it a
coincidence you finally get

03:35.477 --> 03:38.083
the head coaching job the final
season of Jason's high school career?

03:38.268 --> 03:40.552
It is, it's a very
fortunate coincidence.

03:40.798 --> 03:43.203
You gotta feel blessed
to spend your first year

03:43.408 --> 03:44.790
with a young man who's got the talent

03:44.997 --> 03:47.072
and the moral strength this
young man right here has.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.271
Hut!

03:49.067 --> 03:50.323
We'd like to get you all on the field

03:50.528 --> 03:52.120
next  Saturday up in South Bend.

03:52.368 --> 03:54.813
There are really no words to
describle the experience...

03:54.976 --> 03:56.172
Sounds terrific.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.170
We're ready to get this thing done.

04:00.137 --> 04:01.350
Think we are too.

04:02.257 --> 04:03.371
How good is he?

04:04.018 --> 04:06.840
Mrs. Street, I've been scouting
quarterbacks for Notre Dame for 27 years.

04:07.295 --> 04:09.731
Your son may be the
best I have ever seen.

04:10.086 --> 04:12.242
We expect a lot of him,
and, uh, he produces.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.083
And, uh, we're very proud of him.

04:14.226 --> 04:16.512
We go in undefeated, shattering records.

04:16.704 --> 04:19.851
Taking these high expectations
to unimaginable new highs.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.641
State champions.

04:21.866 --> 04:23.083
What's after high school, Brian?

04:23.436 --> 04:25.543
Me and Mack Brown gonna
get our win on in Pasadena.

04:25.758 --> 04:28.612
Get my national championship
on, get my Heisman on.

04:28.826 --> 04:31.850
It's known that a uple years
ago, your father passed away.

04:32.075 --> 04:33.362
And he's not
gonna be able-

04:33.518 --> 04:35.122
No, look, I don't talk
about that, all right?

04:35.337 --> 04:37.312
You wanna ask me football questions,
I'll answer your football questions.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.693
Let's shift gears a minute.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.952
There's been talk of
racism around this squad.

04:42.196 --> 04:44.081
Have you experienced anything like that?

04:44.308 --> 04:45.341
I don't let that fade me.

04:45.757 --> 04:47.993
I just keep my blinders on, and
keep moving. I got things to do.

04:48.215 --> 04:50.153
That's not racism, man.
I just don't like him.

04:50.398 --> 04:54.201
He can be from Saudi
Arabia, or Sweden, or Czech.

04:54.408 --> 04:57.053
That dude could be Santa Claus,
and I still won't like him.

04:57.286 --> 05:00.373
Name's Tim Riggins,
I play, uh, fullback.

05:00.595 --> 05:01.992
It's known that you're one of
the more aggressive players.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.493
What do you find appealing about that?

05:03.717 --> 05:06.422
I just like to hurt people.
Just pull'em down.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.973
This is a very good football
team, and we all know each other

05:09.167 --> 05:11.560
extremely well, so that's how we play.

05:11.827 --> 05:13.342
Saracen, go take a
look at that trash can

05:13.526 --> 05:15.393
for a yellow play sheet, I think
I accidentally threw it out.

05:15.435 --> 05:16.242
H ut!

05:16.776 --> 05:18.313
Move, move, move, move, move!

05:18.478 --> 05:20.130
That's the ball, right
there, that we want, Steve.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.575
Tim, I don't mean to be inappropriate,

05:21.765 --> 05:23.379
but I do smell alcohol on your breath.

05:23.618 --> 05:24.898
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

05:26.029 --> 05:28.510
- Not at all?
- No.

05:28.716 --> 05:29.772
Okay.

05:31.236 --> 05:32.612
Pick it up, pick it up!

05:32.748 --> 05:33.933
You wanna play football today?

05:34.145 --> 05:36.242
What the hell is going
on with you right now?

05:40.056 --> 05:41.443
Are we not clear that in five days

05:41.648 --> 05:44.771
a group of men are gonna be coming
down here to try and destroy you?

05:45.068 --> 05:46.950
Is that not- is
that not clear?

05:48.937 --> 05:49.650
32.

05:51.605 --> 05:52.041
Get up, Riggins.

05:52.396 --> 05:54.272
These same men are gonna
be coming down here.

05:54.606 --> 05:57.052
They're gonna use everything
they have to hurt you.

05:57.318 --> 05:58.530
84.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.571
I'm tired of seein' that
out here on this field!

06:00.795 --> 06:01.863
82...

06:02.317 --> 06:03.180
get up, Riggins.

06:04.236 --> 06:05.140
Get up!

06:05.288 --> 06:06.981
You feel a ttle extra responsibilit.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.162
Yeah, there's a little bit
of extra responsibility.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.200
Of course, that comes with the
territory. It's to be expected.

06:11.356 --> 06:13.461
You wanna do that, you
take it somewhere else!

06:13.597 --> 06:15.473
- How good is this team?
- We're a very good team.

06:16.347 --> 06:17.512
Man, this team's the best team.

06:19.948 --> 06:20.623
They got me.

06:21.306 --> 06:22.432
Get up, Riggins.

06:22.657 --> 06:24.570
They're gonna attempt to do
this in front of your mother,

06:24.747 --> 06:27.142
in front of your fathers,
in front of your brothers,

06:27.315 --> 06:28.402
in front of your sisters.

06:28.657 --> 06:29.843
8.

06:30.597 --> 06:31.703
Come on, son, get up.

06:32.165 --> 06:33.461
You're making us look weak!

06:33.496 --> 06:34.433
I hate that guy.

06:34.608 --> 06:37.593
One person fumbles the
ball, we all fumble the ball!

06:37.858 --> 06:38.452
Hate him.

06:38.625 --> 06:41.790
One person shows up half drunk,
we all show up half drunk!

06:41.977 --> 06:43.132
20.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.900
This is business, I keep it football.

06:45.055 --> 06:46.323
We ain't got time for your games, Rig.

06:46.498 --> 06:47.552
Leave all other stuff at home.

06:49.746 --> 06:50.423
We got a game to win.

06:51.326 --> 06:53.060
Get up, son. Get up!

07:02.146 --> 07:03.653
This is where pretty
much everybody eats.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.260
Uh, I come here and
get the Aztec burger,

07:06.488 --> 07:08.291
every day, leading up to a game.

07:08.478 --> 07:09.861
Oh, yeah, is that an endorsement?

07:10.067 --> 07:11.152
Endorsement, sir?

07:11.307 --> 07:13.973
Well, that could be your first
professional endorsement, the Aztec burger.

07:14.158 --> 07:15.941
No, he doesn't have any endorsements.

07:16.077 --> 07:16.970
- No, no endorsements.
- No way.

07:17.158 --> 07:18.570
- I got some endorsements!
- What you got?

07:18.768 --> 07:21.543
Nike, Adidas.

07:21.747 --> 07:23.033
- Nike and Adidas?
- Yeah.

07:23.188 --> 07:24.483
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

07:24.655 --> 07:26.511
Not the way the Smash does it, baby.

07:26.668 --> 07:28.952
I got so much skills,
there's room for everybody.

07:29.136 --> 07:32.532
Reebok too-I'ma do
Big Macs and Whoppers.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.072
Coke and Pepsi.

07:34.546 --> 07:36.693
Look, I'ma bring the
whole world together, baby.

07:36.896 --> 07:39.241
Then I'ma bust up
Paris Hilton's marriage.

07:39.516 --> 07:40.263
Is that right?

07:40.445 --> 07:42.450
The Smash gonna be running hotel chains.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.712
So, you-you
wanna go for it?

07:44.895 --> 07:47.360
No, that's the coach's daughter.

07:47.698 --> 07:49.443
Yeah, I know-I know
it's the coach's daughter,

07:49.638 --> 07:51.582
but... is that some kind of rule?

07:51.766 --> 07:55.143
I  mean, we can't talk to the coach's
daughter? I wasn't aware of that rule.

07:55.326 --> 07:56.271
Come on, let's go.

08:05.448 --> 08:06.321
Yes?

08:06.478 --> 08:07.641
I'm in your English class.

08:08.586 --> 08:10.001
Okay.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.560
- So is he.
- Yeah.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.782
We were just, ah, wonderin' if you wanna

08:14.965 --> 08:15.922
maybe have some lunch.

08:16.127 --> 08:18.113
You know, talk some Moby Dick.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.740
You're on the football team, right?

08:19.928 --> 08:21.592
I, actually, no, I don't play.

08:21.807 --> 08:24.473
He's technically, barely, on the team.
He never plays.

08:25.348 --> 08:26.700
I hold extra points sometimes.

08:26.915 --> 08:29.350
Yeah, he held two last year, not-not
well,

08:29.537 --> 08:31.613
but he's... he's kinda the backup extra.

08:31.837 --> 08:33.383
I'm the backup quarterback.

08:33.886 --> 08:35.643
But Street plays, I-I don't play much.

08:35.937 --> 08:36.991
But you're still on the team.

08:37.855 --> 08:39.640
And I don't eat with football players.

08:39.847 --> 08:41.803
You know,
I'm not- I'm not a football player.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.552
And I don't eat with you either.

08:44.687 --> 08:45.890
No problem.

08:46.437 --> 08:49.031
How do you see him handling
all these enormous expectations?

08:49.238 --> 08:51.752
You know, Sports Illustrated
has this as the number one

08:51.935 --> 08:53.163
high school football team in Texas.

08:53.328 --> 08:54.970
Oh, I know, that's what I've been saying.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.163
Oh, really?

08:56.466 --> 08:59.072
I don't know,
he-he just handles it really well.

08:59.245 --> 09:00.480
How interesting.

09:00.747 --> 09:02.083
On the field he's so competitive,

09:02.275 --> 09:04.030
but after, when we're
alone, he's not like that.

09:04.265 --> 09:05.593
That is so interesting, really.

09:05.805 --> 09:07.442
I'd be hard-pressed to remember
anything in my entire life

09:07.605 --> 09:09.792
that's ever been so damn interesting.

09:11.066 --> 09:12.103
Whore.

09:18.268 --> 09:19.350
- Smash?
- Hey.

09:19.598 --> 09:20.483
What's up?

09:21.178 --> 09:22.710
Can I get a bite of your burger?

09:23.145 --> 09:25.110
Hey, baby, you can get a
bite of anything you want to.

09:33.675 --> 09:35.342
- Hey.
- Hey babe.

09:35.615 --> 09:37.132
How they lookin'?

09:37.607 --> 09:39.341
They're fast, and they
run a lot of counters.

09:48.748 --> 09:50.010
So I heard a ugly rumor.

09:52.505 --> 09:54.521
- Really?
- Had to do with you and me.

09:54.908 --> 09:57.360
And a certain car dealership
opening tomorrow night.

09:57.706 --> 10:01.012
Oh, shoot.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.403
Did you forget to tell me?

10:02.608 --> 10:04.363
I  think that I did forget to tell you.

10:04.828 --> 10:07.290
- Alaska, I'm just saying.
- I know.

10:07.517 --> 10:09.170
A much more relaxed lifestyle.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.880
It's under advisement.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.633
I'm startin' to look at this whole damn town

10:18.828 --> 10:20.880
like a big ol' out-of-tune
guitar.

10:21.165 --> 10:22.093
You know what I mean?

10:22.445 --> 10:23.622
I mean, smashed up like-
like some-like some

10:23.975 --> 10:25.712
demonic crossword puzzle.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.633
Y'know, 42 across, 11 letters.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.710
Could that be? Yes, it is!

10:30.935 --> 10:32.130
It's Satan's horns.

10:32.428 --> 10:33.793
Is that a word?

10:34.106 --> 10:36.141
'Cause-'cause
I'm seein' it owin' out of Street's mom

10:36.316 --> 10:38.542
whenever she gets within 20
feet of a Notre Dame recruiter.

10:38.795 --> 10:39.743
Stop.

10:39.888 --> 10:42.661
33 down, eight letters, state of bliss.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.211
- Starts with a S.
- Dude, you're just being random.

10:46.436 --> 10:47.893
Try SERENITY, a quality

10:48.105 --> 10:50.022
that's in dire shortness
of supply out here.

10:50.648 --> 10:52.370
But you know what?
It doesn't even matter.

10:52.598 --> 10:53.653
I'm thinking about starting

10:53.818 --> 10:54.973
a Christian speed metal band.

10:55.466 --> 10:57.090
- You in?
- Matthew!

10:57.637 --> 10:59.531
You need to get a new friend.

11:01.515 --> 11:02.620
Ain't funny.

11:12.666 --> 11:15.070
Mr. Street, is it true that you can throw

11:15.265 --> 11:17.903
a 400-yard touchdown pass
to three different receivers

11:18.095 --> 11:19.440
at the same time?

11:19.907 --> 11:21.452
This is true.

11:22.037 --> 11:23.941
Then you must kiss me.

11:32.457 --> 11:34.921
Is it true that you
have superhuman powers

11:35.136 --> 11:38.751
and can demolish buildings
and hurl fireballs?

11:39.496 --> 11:42.050
- This is true.
- Then you must kiss me.

11:47.686 --> 11:48.643
Is it true,
Mr. Street-

11:48.805 --> 11:50.122
That I love Lyla Garrity?

11:50.607 --> 11:52.371
Yes, is that true, Mr. Street?

11:53.595 --> 11:56.783
- That you love Lyla Garrity?
- More than anything in the world.

11:57.195 --> 11:58.680
More than football?

11:59.148 --> 12:01.231
More than almost
anything in the world.

12:16.266 --> 12:17.453
Alright, listen to this, y'all.

12:17.616 --> 12:21.052
Large, bright, family home
nestled on a quiet cul-de-sac,

12:21.338 --> 12:26.720
three large bedrooms, a
pool, and his and her closets.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.940
His and her closets.

12:33.585 --> 12:35.220
Relent.

12:37.555 --> 12:38.311
I'm just sayin'.

12:38.497 --> 12:39.940
I know, I know what you're saying.

12:40.278 --> 12:42.481
Darling, his and her closets.

12:48.096 --> 12:50.350
Moby Dick is actually the
perfect metaphor for this town.

12:50.787 --> 12:54.061
The cold black sea representing
the season in all its uncertainties.

12:56.207 --> 12:57.921
- Dad.
- What?

12:58.137 --> 12:59.961
The magical white whale is the Holy Grail.

13:01.158 --> 13:03.332
- State championship.
- Yeah.

13:03.637 --> 13:05.821
The boat, I mean, the
whalers are the team, right?

13:06.225 --> 13:07.750
The players and the coaches.

13:07.945 --> 13:11.560
Smash Williams is Queequeg,
the hulking, African Zulu,

13:11.717 --> 13:13.172
harpoon-hurling whale killer?

13:13.486 --> 13:15.181
Who's that make me?
Coach Ahab?

13:15.397 --> 13:19.700
Absolutely... coach,
captain, hunter, hunted.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.123
Mm-hmm, his and her closets.

13:22.455 --> 13:24.893
Driven to catch what
may be uncatchable.

13:25.255 --> 13:26.541
I'm not so sure you're mine.

13:26.727 --> 13:28.381
I'm gonna have to order
up a DNA test on you.

13:28.565 --> 13:29.691
Did you hear me?

13:30.258 --> 13:31.742
If we can see over this front line,

13:31.936 --> 13:35.230
and not bite at those counters,
we may just capture that fish.

13:35.526 --> 13:36.982
His and hers closets, baby.

13:37.345 --> 13:39.231
Whoo-ooh!

13:41.018 --> 13:42.263
Leonard, welcome, what's on your mind?

13:42.477 --> 13:44.122
I'm getting tired of
listening to people up here

13:44.326 --> 13:45.082
worrying about the coach.

13:45.236 --> 13:47.422
These people got nothing better
to do but worry about that?

13:47.557 --> 13:49.223
We got boys who can play football.

13:49.426 --> 13:51.231
Well, how's Westerby looking?

13:53.396 --> 13:55.463
- You get down there, Coach?
- Yeah, I just got back.

13:57.315 --> 13:58.610
Yeah, what do you know?

13:59.086 --> 14:00.652
I know they run some of the fastest

14:00.845 --> 14:03.181
son of a bitch counters that
I've seen in a long time.

14:03.648 --> 14:04.763
Now, the front line is big.

14:05.537 --> 14:08.042
Not particularly heavy, but tall.

14:08.688 --> 14:10.810
It's gonna make it hard to follow that ball.

14:11.288 --> 14:13.540
Now, you're gonna need to add
some height on your defense.

14:13.976 --> 14:17.071
Maybe play Dillard and Oliver
on those defensive ends.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.172
That way, it'll give you some height.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.943
You can see down on them counts.

14:21.116 --> 14:21.860
Yeah, I like that.

14:22.066 --> 14:23.691
Hell with what you like.

14:24.045 --> 14:25.970
You have got to win this footbalgame.

14:26.377 --> 14:27.983
Now, Coach, I'm dead serious.

14:28.265 --> 14:31.103
Now, you got no excuses, and that's
a lonely place to be startin'.

14:31.476 --> 14:34.363
With expectations like this, the
only place you can go is down.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.043
That's the problem with being his good.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.210
Yeah, I know.

14:38.756 --> 14:41.030
- Now, you got to drill 'em on counters.
- I will.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.083
- Thanks, Coach.
- How's the family?

14:46.406 --> 14:49.201
- Everybody's feelin' fine.
- Well, enjoy.

14:49.736 --> 14:51.802
'Cause it ain't gonna last.

14:53.575 --> 14:56.570
Coach, it ain't that
serious, it's only football.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.210
It's only football.

15:00.536 --> 15:02.720
- It's only football.
- It's only football.

15:03.286 --> 15:04.572
All right, now.

15:07.827 --> 15:10.551
Uh, we have a few
introductions that we need

15:10.748 --> 15:14.032
to make at this time, starting
with our mayor, Lucy Rodell.

15:15.446 --> 15:17.151
Thank you.

15:17.575 --> 15:18.570
Thank you,

15:18.865 --> 15:22.420
and welcome, everybody, to
the openin' of this beautiful

15:22.656 --> 15:27.110
automobile dealership owned
and operated by Buddy Garrity.

15:27.656 --> 15:28.911
Congratulations, Buddy.

15:34.086 --> 15:36.190
And of course, we wanna
extend a special welcome

15:36.416 --> 15:39.061
to Coach Taylor and his coaching staff.

15:39.367 --> 15:40.993
Gentlemen, can you join me up here?

15:42.015 --> 15:44.270
Come on up here, fellows.

15:45.777 --> 15:48.022
Come on up, we want you up
here on the stage with us.

15:48.776 --> 15:50.972
This is your team, ladies and gentlemen.

15:53.618 --> 15:54.732
I'm gonna make this quick.

15:55.775 --> 15:58.391
As a lot of you know, my
wife does most of the talking

15:58.638 --> 15:59.932
around the house.

16:00.895 --> 16:03.020
I'm gonna get in a lot
of trouble for that too.

16:04.286 --> 16:06.032
Uh, thank you, Mayor.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.100
Uh, I wanna second what Buddy said.

16:08.288 --> 16:10.220
I wanna thank you, everyone,
for coming out tonight.

16:10.716 --> 16:13.033
And I just want to say
what a privilege it is

16:13.228 --> 16:15.310
for each and every one
of us standing up here

16:15.685 --> 16:17.691
to be part of the mighty
Dillon football tradition.

16:26.835 --> 16:29.522
We all-and I speak
for each and every coach,

16:29.956 --> 16:31.760
player, and, uh, trainer up here.

16:32.155 --> 16:33.511
We all feel honored.

16:34.408 --> 16:36.481
And we feel fully prepared to represent

16:36.875 --> 16:39.340
this beloved community
this Friday night,

16:39.897 --> 16:41.451
and  every Friday night.

16:42.537 --> 16:44.541
Until we bring home
that state championship.

16:46.436 --> 16:48.493
Let's see where that love
is if he loses a game.

16:48.525 --> 16:49.200
I know.

16:49.637 --> 16:54.181
Panthers gonna play
extreme, Westerby gonna cry

16:54.508 --> 16:58.193
and scream, Panthers
gonna get diabolical.

16:59.656 --> 17:00.612
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

17:00.847 --> 17:03.820
Like Tom Cruise gets scientological.

17:07.115 --> 17:09.210
Panthers gonna whoop that ass.

17:11.214 --> 17:13.731
As long as Street gets Smash the pass.

17:17.156 --> 17:19.962
C'mon, give it up, give it up!

17:20.445 --> 17:21.270
Put the rings in the air!

17:21.695 --> 17:23.093
Put those rings in the air!

17:23.577 --> 17:25.760
Make some noise.
Get up on your feet!

17:26.246 --> 17:27.501
- Hey, hi!
- Hey!

17:27.705 --> 17:30.440
- How are you?
- Oh, how you?

17:30.617 --> 17:33.053
- I'm great, how are y'all doing?
- Oh, fantastic.

17:33.217 --> 17:33.601
Good.

17:33.807 --> 17:36.321
Now, Tami, how come you
never join us for book club?

17:36.697 --> 17:38.891
Oh, well, you know, with
the beginning of the season-

17:39.236 --> 17:40.383
Oh, come on, Tami.

17:40.867 --> 17:42.341
Wednesday night's our next meeting.

17:42.588 --> 17:44.743
A little wine, a little
gossip, it'll be good for you.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.130
That would be great.

17:46.317 --> 17:48.001
- Fun.
- That would be fun.

17:48.216 --> 17:49.042
We would love to have you.

17:49.195 --> 17:51.150
Oh, thank y'all-
Wednesday night!

17:51.358 --> 17:52.700
- Okay. Wednesday.
- We can't wait.

17:52.895 --> 17:53.611
All right.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.470
Oh, aren't you the cutest
thing I've ever seen?

17:55.798 --> 17:56.841
She is, oh, she is.

17:57.006 --> 17:58.473
- All right, y'all.
- Okay, we'll see ya!

17:58.625 --> 18:00.981
Bye. Thank you so much, bye.

18:01.266 --> 18:03.221
- That's gonna be so awful.
- Stop it.

18:13.336 --> 18:13.871
Excuse me.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.042
How about a little space, huh?

18:19.736 --> 18:20.741
Coach.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.622
Coach, let me see ya.

18:22.816 --> 18:24.231
- How you doing?
- Hey, Pete, how you doing?

18:24.388 --> 18:26.172
- Well, great to see you.
- Hey, Tom, how are you?

18:26.336 --> 18:27.401
Hey, good luck tomorrow night.

18:27.577 --> 18:30.362
Uh, you know, we've been watching
your offense for five years.

18:30.528 --> 18:32.561
So it's your time now
for the big money, right?

18:32.726 --> 18:33.822
You're the boss.

18:33.998 --> 18:36.901
Y'know, your name goes next
to that WRL after this one.

18:37.065 --> 18:38.701
It's not like the last five years, is it?

18:38.876 --> 18:42.201
If he lets you call
anything, throw the ball, son.

18:42.447 --> 18:43.841
- Yes, ma'am.
- Air it out.

18:44.016 --> 18:44.551
Yes, ma'am.

18:44.728 --> 18:46.651
You know you got the skills,
you know it right there.

18:46.855 --> 18:48.063
- Thank you, I...
- You got what it takes.

18:48.226 --> 18:49.303
- Thank you.
- Let her fly.

18:49.508 --> 18:50.802
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're a nice boy.

18:50.978 --> 18:52.633
- Why, thank you.
- And you got great manners.

18:52.775 --> 18:54.522
- Yes, ma'am.
- Knock it off.

18:54.935 --> 18:56.691
You can't go into the game
tomorrow night like that.

18:56.997 --> 18:59.841
The second most important thing
after defense is the kicking game,

19:00.008 --> 19:01.130
and then they can get
their offense in there.

19:01.298 --> 19:03.511
We're hoping we're gonna throw the
ball a little bit more this year.

19:03.657 --> 19:05.351
- Carpet bomb 'em, you understand?
- Yes.

19:05.498 --> 19:06.901
- Chew 'em up, spit 'em out.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:07.066 --> 19:08.243
- So we understand each other.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:08.385 --> 19:10.692
Excellent, good, good.
You like early Black Sabbath?

19:10.897 --> 19:12.853
- Black... Black Sabbath?
- It'll make you mean.

19:13.206 --> 19:15.791
You know, the other thing some
people think is you gotta have

19:15.988 --> 19:17.721
a great quarterback
to win a championship.

19:18.147 --> 19:19.382
That's obviously not true.

19:19.556 --> 19:21.683
I am so confused about what a blitz is.

19:21.905 --> 19:23.462
It sounds a little sexual.

19:23.757 --> 19:24.861
We've been by there a couple times,

19:25.036 --> 19:27.311
and didn't see any cars, and lights
were off, and it concerned us some.

19:27.516 --> 19:29.633
But you have been working,
you've been working.

19:30.178 --> 19:32.192
Have you ever blitzed an older woman?

19:34.187 --> 19:35.130
You could, you know.

19:35.697 --> 19:36.631
Hi, Jason.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.092
Tyra.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.981
So where's Lyla?

19:40.746 --> 19:41.810
She's meetin' me here tonight.

19:42.117 --> 19:43.523
Oh, that's too bad.

19:43.996 --> 19:46.733
- Why's that?
- Y'know, it's gotta get a litt old, Jason.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.491
Like, drinking milk all day, every day.

19:49.805 --> 19:52.042
You oughta try a milkshake
every once in awhile.

19:52.235 --> 19:53.123
What are you gonna do tonight?

19:53.308 --> 19:54.173
What do you do the night before the game?

19:54.315 --> 19:56.032
You've never been a head coach
the night before the game.

19:56.268 --> 19:57.972
You don't even know what
you're gonna do, do you?

19:58.126 --> 20:00.101
Jason, do you mind?
Smile for us.

20:02.477 --> 20:03.993
- Oh, is that your new girlfriend?
- No, no, sir.

20:06.447 --> 20:07.473
No.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.082
Excuse me.

20:09.195 --> 20:10.191
Lyla!

20:10.688 --> 20:12.123
Ly, come here, come here.

20:12.605 --> 20:14.061
Look,
I'm-I'm sorry.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.252
Shouldn't have-I don't
even know how it happened.

20:16.438 --> 20:17.653
She snuck up on me,
cameras started flashing,

20:17.846 --> 20:19.112
I started smiling, I'm sorry.
It shouldn't have happened.

20:19.316 --> 20:20.803
What's your favorite football team?

20:21.085 --> 20:23.322
- Oh, you know, USC.
- Oh, yeah?

20:23.465 --> 20:24.520
- Hey, Smash.
- Hey.

20:24.688 --> 20:25.973
- I gotta roll.
- Yeah.

20:26.276 --> 20:29.043
- How you doin' there, angel eyes?
- Bored as hell.

20:29.328 --> 20:30.810
- I hate these things.
- Yeah?

20:31.057 --> 20:33.821
I mean, you got that, kinda
that deer in the headlights look

20:34.028 --> 20:35.812
that I'm a little worried
about you steppin' up

20:36.028 --> 20:36.913
to the plate here.

20:37.126 --> 20:39.773
Hillary, I did not have sexual
relations with that girl.

20:41.678 --> 20:42.673
So what are you doing?

20:42.996 --> 20:45.020
Y'know, just chillin' on top of the world.

20:45.346 --> 20:46.630
Picking diamonds off the clouds, baby.

20:48.628 --> 20:50.690
- I'd love to pick you one.
- Oh, is that right?

20:50.735 --> 20:51.132
Yeah.

20:51.297 --> 20:52.291
Funny.

20:52.837 --> 20:53.931
It's time to go home.

20:54.578 --> 20:55.473
No, I'm having a conversation.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.473
It's cool, man.

20:56.698 --> 21:00.533
Do yourself a favor, Williams.
Shut your face while I talk to my girl here.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.490
Say that again.

21:01.688 --> 21:02.562
Guys, stop.

21:02.718 --> 21:03.412
- C'mon, Rig.
- No.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.492
No, Rig, bring that.

21:04.637 --> 21:05.941
- Say that again.
- Been meaning to ask you something.

21:06.137 --> 21:07.793
You're all about God,
but at the same time,

21:07.965 --> 21:09.060
you got the bling right there.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.141
Guys, seriously!

21:12.037 --> 21:13.631
You're some mouth, aren't you?

21:14.127 --> 21:16.881
We don't want you to go out
there and be soft and be scared.

21:17.105 --> 21:18.251
Oh, we're not gonna be soft.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.450
We want you to be aggressive now.

21:19.655 --> 21:21.243
Are you going to be
able to answer the bell

21:21.396 --> 21:23.160
and bring championships back to this town?

21:23.338 --> 21:24.340
We wanna win championships.

22:39.876 --> 22:41.792
Now, you guys really want to
focus on learning these plays

22:41.955 --> 22:45.073
'cause these are the exact same
plays that we run, and if you

22:45.228 --> 22:47.311
learn it right here like
we all did, you'll have

22:47.478 --> 22:48.970
a pretty solid understanding
of what's gonna be expected

22:49.155 --> 22:50.000
of you once you get to varsity.

22:50.218 --> 22:52.103
- All right?
- Yes, sir!

22:52.516 --> 22:54.280
- Mr. Street?
- Yes, son?

22:54.725 --> 22:56.520
Are you gonna play professional football?

22:56.856 --> 22:58.733
- I'm thinkin' about it.
- I think you should.

22:59.186 --> 23:00.820
I think you should play for the Cowboys.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.521
And that you should be
better than Roger

23:02.688 --> 23:04.743
Staubach, and better than Troy Aikman.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.463
I'm gonna think about it,

23:06.636 --> 23:08.860
but I'm gonna go through school
first, and we'll see what happens, son.

23:09.106 --> 23:10.780
I think you can be better
than Peyton Manning.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.730
Oh, I appreciate that.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.510
Let's pray.

23:17.626 --> 23:21.822
Sr. Street, do you think God loves football?

23:22.407 --> 23:24.072
I think that everybody loves football.

23:25.018 --> 23:26.662
Me too.

23:31.697 --> 23:35.001
Our Father, who art in
Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

23:35.315 --> 23:37.372
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

23:37.828 --> 23:39.373
on earth as it is in Heaven.

23:43.177 --> 23:43.922
It sure is nice.

23:44.127 --> 23:45.561
Mm-hmm, and you saw the
room in the bathroom.

23:45.797 --> 23:47.813
I am tellin' you, room in
the bathroom is what has

23:47.958 --> 23:50.910
saved more marriages than
Oprah and Dr. Phil combined.

23:54.068 --> 23:56.920
- It is so peaceful, isn't it?
- It is peaceful.

23:57.315 --> 23:59.301
So why don't you have your
wife come down and take a look?

23:59.758 --> 24:01.823
Well, I'll tell you, I don't
think I have to do that.

24:02.058 --> 24:03.223
I think she's gonna like this just fine.

24:03.376 --> 24:04.392
Oh, I'm sure she will.

24:04.745 --> 24:06.161
So you gonna make an offer?

24:06.808 --> 24:08.082
Hmm?

24:08.806 --> 24:09.810
I'll tell you what...

24:11.885 --> 24:14.663
Let's see how we play Friday night,
and then we'll be getting back to you.

24:15.138 --> 24:16.380
You're gonna kill 'em, Coach.

24:16.916 --> 24:18.770
- I hope so.
- Bring 'em hell.

24:21.747 --> 24:23.101
<i>I'm just a little concerned
about Coach Taylor.</i>

24:23.398 --> 24:26.632
<i>He's not been a head coach before.
He's not experienced.</i>

24:26.987 --> 24:29.623
<i>Uh, you know, he's gonna
rely on Street too much.</i>

24:30.036 --> 24:33.140
<i>The thing is, is that, he just
can't keep on throwing all the time.</i>

24:33.478 --> 24:34.922
<i>I mean, this ain't the
West Coast, you know?</i>

24:35.108 --> 24:36.632
<i>- This is Texas football.
- I understand.</i>

24:36.775 --> 24:38.260
<i>He's got a running back
like Smash Williams.</i>

24:38.428 --> 24:39.590
<i>I don't think
he's plannin'-</i>

24:47.258 --> 24:48.482
Here's how I figure it's gonna work.

24:49.157 --> 24:51.093
Correct me if I miss something here, but...

24:52.997 --> 24:55.372
I'm cool just hanging out right here, man.

24:55.848 --> 24:56.850
You go do your, what?

24:57.347 --> 25:00.340
Maybe ten years in the NFL.

25:01.096 --> 25:02.852
Say at five mil a year.

25:03.448 --> 25:05.623
You give me 1% of every paycheck.

25:06.208 --> 25:07.662
Mmm.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.901
When it's all said and
done, you and me are

25:15.085 --> 25:17.350
gonna own ourselves a
big old hunting ranch.

25:18.185 --> 25:19.741
I'll keep it stocked with some ladies.

25:20.058 --> 25:21.890
- What?
- Hello?

25:22.878 --> 25:24.261
There's only one little problem, Rigs.

25:24.918 --> 25:26.112
I don't want you living on my land.

25:26.477 --> 25:27.643
Yeah, you do.

25:29.595 --> 25:32.691
I'm the caretaker, Streeter.
Whether you like it or not.

25:37.706 --> 25:40.233
Here's to God... And football...

25:40.698 --> 25:42.403
And ten years from now, Street.

25:44.408 --> 25:46.582
Good friends living large in Texas.

25:47.956 --> 25:50.390
- Texas forever, Street.
- Texas forever.

25:51.307 --> 25:53.100
Yo, everybody, listen up!

25:53.838 --> 25:54.993
Let's do it.

25:55.957 --> 25:57.861
Let's touch God this time, boys.

25:58.627 --> 26:00.483
Let's touch God.

26:03.097 --> 26:06.721
<i>The radio 470 AM, and it is on.</i>

26:07.136 --> 26:08.593
<i>It is game day, people!</i>

26:09.015 --> 26:12.823
<i>And I have never felt this kind
of electricity. Not in years.</i>

26:13.056 --> 26:16.763
<i>This town of Dillon, Texas is on fire,</i>

26:17.215 --> 26:19.433
<i>and I mean really on fire.</i>

26:33.287 --> 26:35.232
<i>The Panthers should win this
game, there's no question about it.</i>

26:35.376 --> 26:37.000
<i>With all the buildup and
the hype of this season,</i>

26:37.138 --> 26:38.690
<i>and the talent they have on this team...</i>

26:39.045 --> 26:42.261
<i>It's that great offensive backfield
for Dillon that has everybody's eye.</i>

26:42.428 --> 26:44.982
<i>Jason Street, the quarterback,
and Smash Williams,</i>

26:45.158 --> 26:46.923
<i>the tailback, there's
nobody better, probably.</i>

26:47.217 --> 26:50.182
<i>Finally got here after a
long summer of practice.</i>

26:50.296 --> 26:52.252
<i>Lot of expectations on this
Dillon Panther ball club.</i>

26:52.425 --> 26:53.850
<i>Panthers are the team to beat.</i>

26:53.997 --> 26:57.001
<i>Feed the dogs, spit the
fire, lock up your daughters.</i>

26:57.155 --> 27:01.223
<i>Turn on the radio, sit down, and shut
up 'cause it is game time, people!</i>

27:05.016 --> 27:06.041
Gentlemen...

27:08.258 --> 27:11.310
There's been a lot of talk
about expectation lately.

27:11.896 --> 27:16.272
Expectation of what we
should be able to do to win.

27:18.656 --> 27:20.093
People are expecting.

27:21.298 --> 27:23.572
People are expecting quite a bit.

27:26.418 --> 27:30.542
I see us winning out there tonight.
I have no trouble seeing that.

27:31.477 --> 27:34.123
That is not what I'm expecting.

27:35.417 --> 27:37.492
I expect you boys to go out there

27:37.695 --> 27:40.130
and not take this team
lightly because I promise you,

27:40.675 --> 27:43.381
they're gonna come at you
with everything they've got.

27:44.308 --> 27:47.241
- I expect you boys to execute.
- Yes, sir.

27:48.298 --> 27:51.822
- I expect you boys to play football.
- Yes, sir.

27:56.097 --> 27:58.341
- Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
- Can't lose!

28:00.908 --> 28:03.252
- You deserve this, do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

28:03.646 --> 28:05.372
You've earned this, the right to win.

28:05.916 --> 28:08.182
- You put that in your head.
- You too, Coach.

28:08.608 --> 28:10.620
Expect to win.
You've earned that.

28:12.937 --> 28:14.241
<i>We are underway.</i>

28:14.497 --> 28:16.471
<i>Out on the left side,
gets away from one man,</i>

28:16.637 --> 28:18.162
<i>breaks another tackle, and gets about</i>

28:18.326 --> 28:21.231
<i>a 25-yard gain out
to the 40-yard line.</i>

28:22.777 --> 28:24.812
<i>It's a great way to start the season.</i>

28:24.988 --> 28:28.212
We got strong left eye,
wide flip, 24 counter on one.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.632
- On one, ready?
- Huh!

28:29.938 --> 28:31.652
<i>Let's see what this young
superstar's got for us.</i>

28:31.917 --> 28:33.380
<i>First chance to see the 6'2",</i>

28:33.595 --> 28:35.953
<i>190-pound quarterback
Street,along with Smash Williams,</i>

28:36.108 --> 28:37.010
<i>Tim Riggins in the backfield.</i>

28:37.186 --> 28:39.072
<i>The hand-off to Williams,
he tries that right side.</i>

28:39.236 --> 28:39.950
<i>Gets away!</i>

28:40.138 --> 28:41.192
<i>Oh, this kid can move!</i>

28:42.366 --> 28:43.610
<i>First down, Panthers!</i>

28:43.747 --> 28:44.972
<i>...by Smash Williams.</i>

28:45.115 --> 28:46.841
<i>He bounces it outside,and breaks a tackle.</i>

28:47.025 --> 28:48.192
<i>We got the cornerback.</i>

28:48.398 --> 28:50.352
I want Barracuda 550.
Barracuda 550.

28:50.508 --> 28:53.191
<i>And the hand-off this time to
big Tim Riggins, the fullback.</i>

28:53.348 --> 28:55.560
<i>Oh, Tim gets ten yards
before getting pulled down.</i>

28:55.727 --> 28:58.223
<i>You gotta love Tim Riggins when he runs.</i>

28:58.487 --> 28:59.933
It's going back to
Manny, 27 stretch, on one.

29:00.108 --> 29:01.060
On one, ready?

29:01.665 --> 29:03.951
<i>Panthers on a roll, just
like we thought they'd be.</i>

29:04.096 --> 29:05.590
<i>First and ten at the 35.</i>

29:06.577 --> 29:08.092
<i>Street, drops straight back to pass,</i>

29:08.235 --> 29:09.803
<i>has Eugene Williams open over the middle.</i>

29:10.057 --> 29:11.223
<i>He's there with a touchdown!</i>

29:11.378 --> 29:13.753
<i>Touchdown, the first
touchdown of the season!</i>

29:15.658 --> 29:17.332
<i>So it's Westerby's turn to respond now,</i>

29:17.506 --> 29:19.080
<i>after the easy touchdown
drive for Dillon.</i>

29:19.295 --> 29:22.143
<i>Coy Awnee brings back the kickoff
for Westerby, and up the left side,</i>

29:22.328 --> 29:24.772
<i>the near side, he gets away,
and gets a beautiful run</i>

29:24.937 --> 29:26.693
<i>back to the Dillon 40-yard line.</i>

29:26.906 --> 29:29.500
<i>And the first down's called,
a little bit of misdirection,</i>

29:29.676 --> 29:31.573
<i>as they always do, and
Campbell bounces it out.</i>

29:31.707 --> 29:32.643
<i>And gets away!</i>

29:32.986 --> 29:34.392
<i>He's gonna go all the
way into the end zone!</i>

29:34.635 --> 29:37.722
<i>Westerby scores on its
first play from scrimmaging.</i>

29:37.885 --> 29:41.641
<i>Wow, we heard about these
counters, and man are they fast.</i>

29:41.876 --> 29:43.673
<i>What a great misdirection.</i>

29:44.075 --> 29:45.943
<i>And it fooled the Panthers.</i>

29:46.847 --> 29:48.200
<i>We're already into the second quarter.</i>

29:48.375 --> 29:51.123
<i>Westerby's Chaps giving us
all we can handle right now.</i>

29:53.755 --> 29:54.950
<i>Big block.</i>

29:55.167 --> 29:56.190
<i>Tim Riggins.</i>

30:01.467 --> 30:03.782
<i>Jason Street brings him out.
Takes the step.</i>

30:03.928 --> 30:04.940
<i>Drops straight back to pass.</i>

30:05.158 --> 30:06.870
<i>Looks left. Finds Tony Golia.
He's there.</i>

30:07.026 --> 30:09.033
<i>He's got to catch, dives
to the cone. Did he get in?</i>

30:09.187 --> 30:10.841
<i>Yes, touchdown, Dillon!</i>

30:11.575 --> 30:12.821
Don't you fall for that!

30:13.007 --> 30:16.202
<i>That's the sign of a great leader
and that's who Jason Street is.</i>

30:16.407 --> 30:19.452
<i>Westerby with the first down and
ten at the 30-yard line, though.</i>

30:20.157 --> 30:21.012
That's it!

30:21.217 --> 30:23.283
<i>And Ferguson, one-on-one
coverage, is open over the middle.</i>

30:23.445 --> 30:24.672
<i>He's got it!</i>

30:25.085 --> 30:26.363
<i>Touchdown, Westerby.</i>

30:26.796 --> 30:28.040
<i>I'll tell you, Westerby is showing up</i>

30:28.207 --> 30:30.511
<i>a lot stronger than
anyone thought they would.</i>

30:30.815 --> 30:35.023
<i>Coach Taylor has got to do something
to get his defense into this game.</i>

30:36.906 --> 30:39.131
You need to get your head out of
your butt and start playing up

30:39.278 --> 30:40.712
to your own district potential.

30:40.987 --> 30:43.471
'Cause you ain't doing it now!
He's having to help you.

30:43.898 --> 30:46.313
Haven't we got one guy coming,
he's having to help you?!

30:46.538 --> 30:49.020
- What are you seeing out there, Street?
- Seeing a lot of Texas defense, coach.

30:49.205 --> 30:50.193
- Texas?
- Yes, sir.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.123
Our corners are jamming.
They're staying out there in the flats.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.020
It seems like I'm getting a lot
of pressure off the outsides.

30:54.245 --> 30:56.690
Coming off the ends like crazy.
I can't even see 'em.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.823
The safeties are staying pretty
deep, so we got a lot of short stuff.

31:00.986 --> 31:02.640
More slants and crosses, I think.

31:03.678 --> 31:04.792
Play it close to over the top?

31:04.938 --> 31:06.120
We can fade if I can get some time.

31:06.247 --> 31:07.792
But they gotta beat
that jam off of the line.

31:07.965 --> 31:09.841
Plus, I'm getting blitzed
like crazy off the weak side.

31:09.995 --> 31:10.991
I ain't even see it coming.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.323
You are not that good!

31:12.505 --> 31:14.061
See what's going on, now.
We need some more time.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.533
Coach, they are running
the box down on us.

31:16.706 --> 31:19.200
We have not been communicating.
We're gonna pick it up now.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.011
Hey, you guys wanna communicate now?!

31:21.207 --> 31:22.190
Yes, sir!

31:22.358 --> 31:23.611
We're going into a fistfight!

31:26.007 --> 31:27.442
<i>Smash gets the call,
tries to go outside.</i>

31:27.645 --> 31:30.103
<i>There's nothing there, and he
gets thrown for a five-yard loss.</i>

31:30.716 --> 31:32.011
That didn't work.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.941
<i>They're totally out of sorts
here in the second half.</i>

31:35.556 --> 31:38.372
Fellas, this is our field day.
Do not push us around!

31:38.525 --> 31:40.370
<i>Street tries to find
Horn over the middle. He gets...</i>

31:41.565 --> 31:43.630
<i>And even the passing
game's out of sync, K.C.</i>

31:43.796 --> 31:47.121
<i>Nothing is working right now.
It is really a dangerous time.</i>

31:47.406 --> 31:49.543
<i>Westerby blew out that
offensive line that time.</i>

31:50.447 --> 31:52.433
54 Bandit. Jesus, they're fast!

31:52.628 --> 31:54.113
Run your routes.
Have faith in your routes.

31:54.258 --> 31:55.331
You will catch the ball.

31:55.518 --> 31:57.800
It will be there every time, and
we will take this down the field.

31:57.965 --> 32:00.793
<i>Nobody expected Westerby to be
giving us this kinda trouble.</i>

32:00.958 --> 32:04.111
<i>The Panthers are looking
completely outta sync!</i>

32:10.897 --> 32:13.331
<i>Westerby right now
clearly with the momentum.</i>

32:13.485 --> 32:14.730
Ed, that was horse crud!

32:15.095 --> 32:16.402
Watch yourself, Coach.

32:16.997 --> 32:19.100
<i>You let a team like Westerby
stick around long enough,</i>

32:19.258 --> 32:20.591
<i>they think they could beat ya.</i>

32:23.398 --> 32:25.363
<i>And the give is to Campbell
on the counter yet again.</i>

32:25.537 --> 32:28.170
<i>And he gets a long way all the
way down towards the goal line.</i>

32:28.346 --> 32:29.621
<i>He is down at the one yard line.</i>

32:29.668 --> 32:32.930
<i>They just seem to have no
answer for these counters.</i>

32:33.137 --> 32:35.630
<i>Triple stack formation.
Fakes once, fakes twice.</i>

32:35.775 --> 32:37.172
<i>Gives to Cameron
over the top-dives-</i>

32:37.315 --> 32:38.702
<i>And he's in the end zone!</i>

32:38.867 --> 32:40.262
<i>Touchdown Westerby!</i>

32:40.305 --> 32:42.940
<i>The Westerby Chaps lead
with six minutes to go.</i>

32:43.095 --> 32:46.830
<i>And Coach Taylor and his boys are
in deep trouble with time running out.</i>

32:46.987 --> 32:49.502
<i>The Panthers cannot
believe what's going on.</i>

32:49.687 --> 32:52.040
<i>Eric Taylor's gotta do something
to figure this thing out.</i>

32:52.195 --> 32:55.061
<i>Dillon trying to rally from down ten.
A flip pass to Williams.</i>

32:55.186 --> 32:56.582
<i>That's another first down.</i>

32:56.785 --> 32:58.082
<i>Move the ball! Move the ball!</i>

32:59.096 --> 33:00.693
We're gonna come back.

33:01.515 --> 33:03.143
Look at me! Are you
ready to play this game?

33:03.317 --> 33:07.133
We got strong left, 89 gun,
453 heat on one, on one.

33:07.248 --> 33:07.772
Ready, break!

33:07.926 --> 33:09.432
Third and five on the Panther 38.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.573
Come on now, offense. Let's go!

33:12.665 --> 33:14.260
<i>Well, they gotta get
something going. Down by ten.</i>

33:14.427 --> 33:17.480
<i>They need two possessions, and score in
those two possessions to win the ballgame.</i>

33:17.677 --> 33:18.590
<i>Third and five.</i>

33:18.756 --> 33:22.222
<i>And Street looks like he's in command
like we've seen him look before.</i>

33:22.398 --> 33:24.373
<i>This is a critical
play for the Panthers.</i>

33:25.007 --> 33:25.931
Hut!

33:26.445 --> 33:28.051
<i>Street takes the snap.
Drops back to pass.</i>

33:28.196 --> 33:29.523
<i>Has protection. Throws a wobble.</i>

33:29.687 --> 33:31.931
<i>Oh, it's picked off by Chandler.
Interception.</i>

33:32.078 --> 33:34.012
<i>He's got a good wall in front of him.
Down on the left side.</i>

33:34.165 --> 33:36.721
<i>Street the only one that
might be able to get to him.</i>

33:39.785 --> 33:41.061
<i>Fumble on the play. A fumble.</i>

33:41.218 --> 33:41.863
<i>The ball is loose!</i>

33:41.996 --> 33:42.871
Get the ball!

33:44.837 --> 33:47.072
That's a gigantic hit on Street.

33:47.265 --> 33:48.880
He's down on the ground. He is down.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.613
- Who is that, Street?
- That's Street.

33:51.218 --> 33:52.173
Trainer!

33:52.416 --> 33:53.002
What happened?

33:53.136 --> 33:54.881
<i>And he's not moving.
That was a heckuva hit!</i>

33:55.048 --> 33:56.470
<i>When Street met Chandler.</i>

33:56.648 --> 33:58.700
<i>And he was the only one that
could've stopped him from scoring</i>

33:58.856 --> 34:01.720
<i>what would've been a game-ending
touchdown basically for Westerby.</i>

34:07.768 --> 34:09.020
He's not getting up.

34:09.226 --> 34:10.322
It's very quiet here in this stadium.

34:10.458 --> 34:11.802
Doctor.

34:11.976 --> 34:12.929
He's not getting up.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.400
You know, this is obviously
the worst nightmare

34:18.577 --> 34:20.650
for a coach and especially for a parent.

34:21.027 --> 34:24.172
Well, you know, his entire family
of course in the crowd tonight.

34:24.335 --> 34:27.670
Even some folks from his family
from out of state making the trip.

34:29.016 --> 34:30.070
Why isn't he getting up?

34:31.226 --> 34:32.972
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

34:35.337 --> 34:37.230
Okay, I'm gonna check
your eyes-Hold on.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.411
Jason!

34:47.764 --> 34:49.681
Jason, get up!

34:50.637 --> 34:52.213
Please.

35:01.996 --> 35:04.450
I think it's a spinal injury.
I'm not sure yet.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.680
But he has
been moving-

35:05.827 --> 35:06.610
Can you squeeze my hands for me, buddy?

35:06.766 --> 35:08.093
- Squeezing!
- Good, good, good.

35:08.265 --> 35:09.963
- Can you move your feet for me?
- Yes.

35:10.126 --> 35:11.423
Good, good, good.
All right.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.012
Should we try to get him
on the backboard real quick?

35:13.145 --> 35:14.470
Let's keep him steady, guys.
Let's keep him steady.

35:14.618 --> 35:16.251
It looks likthey're gonna
have to take him off.

35:16.396 --> 35:17.993
In fact, they've got him
strapped to the headboard

35:18.127 --> 35:19.261
now and they're lifting him up,

35:19.428 --> 35:20.761
and they'll put him in
the ambulance shortly.

35:21.488 --> 35:22.912
- Just move him sideways slowly.
- Perfect.

35:23.086 --> 35:24.960
- You're doing real good there. Real good.
- Thank you.

35:25.118 --> 35:27.191
Okay, we're going up.
One, two, three.

35:31.145 --> 35:32.343
Okay, we're going up.

35:54.598 --> 35:56.600
<i>You know, the amazing thing
is we got the number one</i>

35:56.758 --> 35:59.213
<i>football player in America
carted off on a stretcher.</i>

35:59.397 --> 36:01.361
<i>But this game has to go on.
It has to be finished.</i>

36:01.506 --> 36:02.713
<i>And the third
string quarterback-</i>

36:02.867 --> 36:03.970
<i>no one's seen
this guy play-</i>

36:04.168 --> 36:05.222
<i>is Matt Saracen.</i>

36:05.378 --> 36:07.311
<i>I don't know if he's
taken a snap in practice.</i>

36:07.486 --> 36:09.010
<i>Well, you can see the
look on his face right now.</i>

36:09.217 --> 36:11.842
<i>I don't think he ever
expected to play in this one.</i>

36:11.877 --> 36:15.710
<i>You know, here he is in
maybe the biggest game of his life.</i>

36:15.928 --> 36:17.833
<i>Yeah, this young man's
gonna have to get down</i>

36:18.007 --> 36:20.401
<i>to some serious business,
because his team needs it.</i>

36:20.585 --> 36:22.313
<i>And he's gonna have to
communicate with this team</i>

36:22.485 --> 36:23.671
<i>and get them back in the game.</i>

36:24.597 --> 36:26.611
Coach, I need your captains, please.

36:26.755 --> 36:27.882
Captains!

36:29.775 --> 36:32.120
Saracen. Quarterback's captain.

36:47.655 --> 36:48.903
Okay, guys.
Everybody all right?

36:49.525 --> 36:51.141
We have just under three minutes to go.

36:51.327 --> 36:53.352
I want you to play hard.
I want you to play fair.

36:53.565 --> 36:57.040
And I want you to go back and tell
your players to keep your heads up.

36:57.266 --> 36:59.891
Hit only what you see.
Y'all understand?

37:00.086 --> 37:02.113
I want you to take that back
and tell your guys, all right?

37:02.286 --> 37:04.872
Let's finish this thing up with style.
Best of luck, guys.

37:24.736 --> 37:26.163
<i>You gotta be calm in this situation.</i>

37:26.337 --> 37:29.161
<i>Don't turn the ball over.
Don't do something foolish.</i>

37:29.406 --> 37:32.122
- All right, we're going pro right 90.
- No, we're going pro left 90.

37:32.275 --> 37:32.943
Pro left 90.

37:33.276 --> 37:35.181
- You know the play, right?
- Yeah, okay.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.580
We're going
pro-pro left 90.

37:37.776 --> 37:39.511
25 blast on one.

37:39.697 --> 37:41.053
- Ready?
- Break!

37:45.488 --> 37:48.991
<i>Matt Saracen, the sophomore,
comes out and leads his team</i>

37:49.156 --> 37:50.532
<i>to the line of scrimmage to take</i>

37:50.698 --> 37:53.560
<i>his first meaningful
snap probably in his life.</i>

37:53.768 --> 37:56.941
<i>And everybody's looking
at young Matt Saracen,</i>

37:57.116 --> 37:59.372
<i>who calls the wrong
play and gets drilled.</i>

37:59.607 --> 38:02.412
<i>He went the wrong way,
and he paid the price.</i>

38:08.255 --> 38:09.922
<i>Well, you gotta try
and get a first down.</i>

38:10.057 --> 38:11.221
Come on, Matt. You can do it!

38:11.387 --> 38:13.983
<i>Okay, here's Saracen
dropping back to pass.</i>

38:14.146 --> 38:14.681
<i>And he throws
the ball-</i>

38:14.828 --> 38:16.603
<i>Oh, man. This kid is shook up.</i>

38:16.746 --> 38:19.033
<i>He has hit his own man right
in the back of the helmet.</i>

38:19.196 --> 38:22.193
<i>That's not the way to instill
confidence in your teammates.</i>

38:29.156 --> 38:30.222
Saracen, get over here!

38:30.466 --> 38:31.662
<i>Panther time-out.</i>

38:38.478 --> 38:39.790
You okay?

38:40.085 --> 38:42.213
Breathe. Slow down.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.191
I want you to try to read the coverage.

38:51.378 --> 38:52.352
You remember how to read the coverage?

38:52.525 --> 38:53.922
- Not so well, sir.
- Look at me.

38:54.477 --> 38:56.443
What you do is you go
out there and you look

38:56.648 --> 38:57.642
before you throw the ball.

38:58.147 --> 39:00.913
You look and see where the defense
is and you see where our guys are.

39:01.175 --> 39:02.531
- You with me?
- Yes, sir.

39:02.915 --> 39:04.160
Then you throw the ball to our guys.

39:04.346 --> 39:06.260
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

39:10.656 --> 39:11.940
Do your best.

39:13.138 --> 39:14.330
Go on.

39:14.526 --> 39:17.391
<i>Coach Taylor has gotta be just
thinking about getting out of this game.</i>

39:28.475 --> 39:30.663
We're going pro right, 25 shovel.
Smash, this is you.

39:30.857 --> 39:31.802
- I got this.
- All right, ready?

39:31.938 --> 39:32.891
- On one.
- Break!

39:33.135 --> 39:35.042
Big ol' third down play
now for the Panthers.

39:35.188 --> 39:37.231
<i>Let's see if Saracen can at
least get the snap this time.</i>

39:37.388 --> 39:38.540
<i>He's got to do something with this play.</i>

39:38.755 --> 39:40.301
<i>Saracen back to pass.</i>

39:40.666 --> 39:42.980
<i>A shovel pass to Williams.
Goes off the left side.</i>

39:43.175 --> 39:43.843
<i>Has some room.</i>

39:44.017 --> 39:46.971
<i>Up the field he goes.
Hey, that's a pretty good toss.</i>

39:47.117 --> 39:48.103
<i>Awesome. Great job.</i>

39:48.315 --> 39:50.043
<i>And they needed that play, K.C.</i>

39:50.205 --> 39:54.092
<i>All of a sudden, some life on the
Panther sideline and in the stands too.</i>

39:55.347 --> 39:57.241
Strong right eye, 28 tango.

39:57.427 --> 39:59.001
- Ready? On one.
- Break!

39:59.175 --> 40:00.921
<i>You can feel the energy
picking up a little bit now.</i>

40:01.077 --> 40:02.332
<i>Maybe something's starting to happen.</i>

40:03.676 --> 40:04.960
I'm going in. It's all you.

40:07.176 --> 40:08.720
<i>Saracen at the line of scrimmage.</i>

40:09.346 --> 40:10.082
Hut!

40:10.277 --> 40:12.101
<i>Takes the snap.
Pitches to Smash.</i>

40:12.296 --> 40:14.681
<i>He's got some room.
He's gonna go all the way.</i>

40:14.895 --> 40:15.690
<i>Touchdown!</i>

40:15.857 --> 40:16.733
<i>Hey, okay.</i>

40:16.895 --> 40:17.773
<i>Just like that.</i>

40:17.978 --> 40:19.812
<i>The Panthers are right back in the game.</i>

40:20.107 --> 40:21.042
<i>We did it!</i>

40:21.185 --> 40:23.122
<i>Now it's all about the clock.</i>

40:23.326 --> 40:24.671
<i>They've got less than a minute to go.</i>

40:24.845 --> 40:26.651
<i>Coach Taylor's gotta be
thinking about an onside kick.</i>

40:26.796 --> 40:29.413
<i>Gotta get the good hands,people out
there who line up and get that ball.</i>

40:30.938 --> 40:32.652
<i>And here's the kick.
It is onside.</i>

40:33.497 --> 40:36.142
<i>A mad scramble!
Westerby misses it!</i>

40:36.296 --> 40:38.363
<i>The ball is still loose.
A scramble for the ball.</i>

40:38.525 --> 40:41.322
<i>Who's got it?
It looks like could the Panther ball.</i>

40:42.418 --> 40:44.641
<i>Panthers have it!
Here we go!</i>

40:44.828 --> 40:45.460
<i>All right!</i>

40:46.927 --> 40:48.561
<i>Timmy Riggins comes
up with the football.</i>

40:50.865 --> 40:52.752
Go right 90, 7-5 high.

40:52.937 --> 40:55.562
We got a chance to win this game.

40:57.777 --> 40:58.440
<i>What a story.</i>

40:58.588 --> 41:01.073
<i>Young Matt Saracen bringing
his team back into the ballgame.</i>

41:03.035 --> 41:04.241
<i>He drops back to pass.</i>

41:04.395 --> 41:05.071
<i>No, fakes!</i>

41:05.246 --> 41:06.972
<i>He hands off.
Statue of Liberty-</i>

41:07.148 --> 41:08.521
<i>He'll school you if he's got room.</i>

41:08.657 --> 41:10.453
<i>He's gonna have to get
out of bounds, and he does!</i>

41:14.555 --> 41:15.252
<i>They're gonna have to hurry.</i>

41:15.407 --> 41:17.543
<i>It's gonna start as soon
as they move those chains.</i>

41:18.455 --> 41:20.080
<i>Trying to get the team back on sides.</i>

41:20.257 --> 41:22.013
<i>Coach Taylor screaming in plays.</i>

41:22.288 --> 41:23.870
<i>It's chaos out there right now.</i>

41:25.478 --> 41:26.590
Towards right! Towards right!

41:28.418 --> 41:29.260
Go, go!

41:29.856 --> 41:30.503
<i>Snap the ball!</i>

41:30.635 --> 41:31.802
<i>Rushing to get the play off.</i>

41:32.487 --> 41:34.021
<i>Saracen calling for the shotgun.</i>

41:34.795 --> 41:37.583
<i>He's back. He's left.
He falls.</i>

41:37.786 --> 41:39.231
<i>No, he gets up on his feet.</i>

41:39.415 --> 41:41.382
<i>Being pursued by two Westerby defenders.</i>

41:41.607 --> 41:42.543
Go, baby!

41:43.745 --> 41:45.280
Come on, Matthew!

41:46.078 --> 41:47.113
<i>He eludes a tackle.</i>

41:49.457 --> 41:50.813
<i>The clock runs out.
He pumps.</i>

41:55.727 --> 41:58.041
<i>He steps up.
He hurls that football.</i>

41:59.236 --> 42:00.861
<i>Oh, man, can this kid throw the ball!</i>

42:04.847 --> 42:06.232
<i>He's definitely wide open.</i>

42:06.498 --> 42:07.450
<i>He's got it!</i>

42:07.717 --> 42:08.882
<i>At the 20... the 10...</i>

42:09.065 --> 42:10.392
<i>He's going all the way!</i>

42:10.686 --> 42:12.351
<i>Touchdown!</i>

42:12.496 --> 42:14.593
<i>Panthers win! Panthers win!</i>

42:14.766 --> 42:19.481
<i>Matt Saracen somehow brings this
team back to win the football game.</i>

42:19.696 --> 42:21.191
<i>How do you do?</i>

42:47.388 --> 42:48.710
Congratulations, Coach.

42:55.327 --> 42:55.752
Right now,

42:55.927 --> 42:58.133
it's not really about
who wins or loses, Father.

42:58.317 --> 43:00.283
We just all wanna be with
Street right now, God.

43:00.475 --> 43:02.822
We know that you work in mysterious ways

43:03.027 --> 43:05.862
and we just wanna send
our spirit, our presence,

43:06.045 --> 43:09.122
our love, just to heal
him in whatever way, Lord-

43:09.337 --> 43:10.643
whatever might be broken, Lord.

43:10.867 --> 43:12.251
Just fix it right now, Father.

43:12.737 --> 43:14.340
Jesus, in your name we pray.

43:14.707 --> 43:15.561
Amen.

43:17.476 --> 43:19.601
<i>Give all of us gathered here tonight the</i>

43:19.788 --> 43:22.502
strength to remember that
life is so very fragile.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.942
<i>We are all vulnerable.</i>

43:25.828 --> 43:30.302
<i>And we will all, at some
point in our lives... fall.</i>

43:30.947 --> 43:32.643
<i>We will all fall.</i>

43:35.915 --> 43:37.611
<i>We must carry this in our hearts...</i>

43:39.166 --> 43:40.842
<i>that what we have is special.</i>

43:43.208 --> 43:44.612
<i>That it can be taken from us...</i>

43:45.676 --> 43:47.373
<i>and that when it is taken from us,</i>

43:48.407 --> 43:49.783
<i>we will be tested.</i>

43:52.467 --> 43:54.380
<i>We will be tested to our very souls.</i>

44:01.886 --> 44:03.813
<i>We will now all be tested.</i>

44:09.788 --> 44:10.811
<i>It is these times-</i>

44:11.238 --> 44:12.500
<i>it is
this pain-</i>

44:13.546 --> 44:15.380
<i>that allows us to look inside ourselves.</i>
