WEBVTT

00:01.859 --> 00:03.593
You left me alone in your apartment.

00:03.628 --> 00:07.030
This feels like a new phase
in our relationship.

00:08.766 --> 00:11.368
You were asleep and I was hungry.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.913
Okay.

00:16.727 --> 00:18.662
Come here. You gotta...

00:19.510 --> 00:21.144
- Try this.
- What is it?

00:21.179 --> 00:24.548
It's a pork chop sandwich.
It's the true taste of Chicago.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.183
Kim, it's breakfast.

00:26.217 --> 00:28.151
I... I know. It's hard to explain.

00:28.186 --> 00:31.743
It just works. Try it. Just try it, okay?

00:31.777 --> 00:33.190
Uh, okay.

00:36.027 --> 00:37.039
Mmm!

00:37.074 --> 00:38.500
- Right?
- Mmm.

00:41.587 --> 00:44.319
Sorry, I've got to take this to go.
Kelton wants to see me.

00:46.879 --> 00:49.106
Hey, I feel like I've
earned the right to ask.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.674
Why is a black man working so hard

00:50.708 --> 00:52.652
to make a white cop our next mayor?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.764
Uh, it's easy. Economic reasons.

00:54.798 --> 00:56.446
The white cop is paying me

00:56.471 --> 00:58.639
and there's still room on the
bandwagon if you want to join.

00:58.673 --> 01:01.141
Mm-mm, I'll pass. See you tonight?

01:01.176 --> 01:03.043
Yes, but please let me pick
the restaurant.

01:03.077 --> 01:04.711
I am too young to see a cardiologist.

01:08.082 --> 01:09.349
You taste like grease.

01:09.384 --> 01:11.180
Mmm, it's the taste of Chicago.

01:12.086 --> 01:14.288
- See ya.
- All right.

01:15.857 --> 01:18.292
But today is just the beginning.

01:18.326 --> 01:21.728
Future Chicago is helping open centers

01:21.763 --> 01:25.165
to serve the young people
all around the city.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.836
I gotta hand it to Price.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.827
I grew up around here.
This place was a hellhole.

01:30.861 --> 01:32.101
It is my honor to introduce to you

01:32.136 --> 01:34.141
the next mayor of Chicago,

01:34.175 --> 01:36.643
my father Ray Price.

01:38.379 --> 01:40.080
Looks like she'll be mayor one day.

01:40.114 --> 01:42.149
That wouldn't surprise me.

01:42.183 --> 01:44.551
Thank you, thank you,

01:44.586 --> 01:46.215
and thank you, Jasmine.

01:46.855 --> 01:49.156
Like my daughter said,

01:49.190 --> 01:51.758
Future Chicago is dedicated to creating

01:51.793 --> 01:53.727
positive support systems for our children

01:53.761 --> 01:58.565
and we want to make sure that
every single kid in this city

01:58.600 --> 02:00.567
gets the same chance to succeed.

02:00.602 --> 02:02.369
This ain't your neighborhood, all right?

02:02.403 --> 02:03.898
Go back where you belong!

02:03.933 --> 02:06.607
My friend, my friend,

02:06.641 --> 02:09.842
I respect your exercise of free speech,

02:09.877 --> 02:11.678
but I reject what you're saying.

02:11.713 --> 02:13.575
Because we have
to break down the barriers

02:13.609 --> 02:15.349
that have divided this city.

02:15.383 --> 02:17.251
We are all Chicagoans.

02:18.820 --> 02:23.056
We all want good jobs.
We all want good schools.

02:23.091 --> 02:24.628
A fair chance.

02:25.627 --> 02:28.395
Now Brian Kelton wants you
to look to the past,

02:28.429 --> 02:30.697
but the train is going
the other direction.

02:30.732 --> 02:34.534
Look to our children, look to the future,

02:34.569 --> 02:36.303
and let's get there together.

02:36.337 --> 02:37.541
Thank you.

02:41.743 --> 02:45.112
Ray Price, Ray Price,
Ray Price, Ray Price!

02:45.146 --> 02:46.291
Thank you.

02:48.349 --> 02:50.918
- Thanks for coming out, Hank.
- Yeah.

02:50.952 --> 02:53.487
Ray, I gave you a smoking gun
against Kelton.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.922
How come you haven't used it?

02:54.956 --> 02:57.491
Because I don't need to.
Not at this time.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.993
I've got a 6-point lead
in the polls, Hank.

03:00.028 --> 03:01.728
I'm on an upswing.

03:01.763 --> 03:04.665
No point wasting a bullet when
your opponent is bleeding out.

03:04.699 --> 03:05.753
Ray.

03:06.301 --> 03:08.046
Kelton ain't dead yet.

03:08.503 --> 03:10.070
Matter of time.

03:10.104 --> 03:12.572
Now look, I don't want to drag
this campaign through the mud.

03:12.607 --> 03:15.409
People are tired of old Chicago politics.

03:15.443 --> 03:17.097
They want a positive message.

03:19.113 --> 03:20.414
Shots fired!

03:20.448 --> 03:22.349
Shots fired! Everyone down!

03:22.383 --> 03:23.951
Hang in there, Ray. Hang in there.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.819
It's okay, hang in there.

03:25.853 --> 03:27.454
Anyone see where those shots came from?

03:27.488 --> 03:29.489
No! Call it in!

03:29.524 --> 03:32.426
- Daddy! Daddy!
- 5021 Frank, 10-1, I repeat...

03:32.460 --> 03:35.362
Come on, help me, keep pressure here.

03:35.396 --> 03:37.631
Shots fired into a crowd. Man down.

03:37.665 --> 03:39.766
Roll an ambo
and get some people over here.

03:39.801 --> 03:42.551
Hey, listen! We've got to get
everybody in that building!

03:42.586 --> 03:43.637
Let's go!

03:43.671 --> 03:45.605
Antonio, I've got eyes
on that loud mouth.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.040
He's right ahead of you.

03:47.075 --> 03:48.809
Something doesn't feel right
about this guy.

03:48.843 --> 03:50.944
Kim, I've got the block to the west!

03:50.979 --> 03:52.346
Get inside! Take cover!

03:52.380 --> 03:53.947
5021 Eddie, I got a possible offender.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.482
Male, green hat,

03:55.516 --> 03:57.484
heading northbound on Union
towards 18th street.

04:00.488 --> 04:01.955
Against the wall, against the wall!

04:01.990 --> 04:03.390
Move against the wall!

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074

04:26.014 --> 04:28.315
Chicago PD, let me see your hands!

04:30.284 --> 04:32.214
Put your hands out now!

04:32.887 --> 04:34.521
Now!

04:34.555 --> 04:36.556
Ah!

04:37.525 --> 04:38.759
It wasn't me, all right?

04:38.793 --> 04:40.260
I was just trying to get out of there!

04:40.294 --> 04:42.896
- Anything? Anything?
- Huh?

04:42.930 --> 04:44.064
He's clean.

04:44.098 --> 04:45.249
See?

04:45.284 --> 04:47.200
5021 Eddie, we think
this guy's a negative.

04:47.235 --> 04:49.058
Advise all units to proceed
to the scene with caution.

04:49.092 --> 04:50.602
The shooter is still in the area.

04:50.637 --> 04:52.672
I repeat, the shooter
is still in the area.

04:52.707 --> 04:55.242
<i>Copy that, 5021...</i>

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

05:00.214 --> 05:01.515
We run GSR on the guy?

05:01.549 --> 05:02.603
Came back negative.

05:02.637 --> 05:05.085
Patrol's doing interviews,
no weapon, nothing.

05:05.119 --> 05:06.373
Shooter's in the wind.

05:07.121 --> 05:10.023
Alicia, I cannot tell you how sorry I am.

05:10.058 --> 05:13.593
I wish I could say I was
surprised, but sadly, I'm not.

05:13.628 --> 05:16.842
I promise you, we're going
to find who did this to Ray.

05:17.765 --> 05:19.566
This is Detective Halstead.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.034
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but were you aware

05:21.069 --> 05:23.403
of any specific threats
against your husband?

05:23.438 --> 05:24.791
My husband was ahead in the polls.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.226
You know, I just...

05:27.811 --> 05:29.376
I would start looking at
the people who would

05:29.410 --> 05:31.411
most benefit by taking
him out of the running.

05:34.615 --> 05:36.483
Superintendent.

05:36.517 --> 05:38.552
It is a sad day, Sergeant.

05:38.586 --> 05:40.921
- Yes, it is.
- Won't you, uh...

05:42.924 --> 05:44.558
Would you bring me up to speed?

05:44.592 --> 05:47.794
Oh, nothing yet... my team's
still working the scene.

05:48.996 --> 05:51.334
Known Ray Price for a very long time.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.712
We were rivals, we...

05:54.635 --> 05:57.637
we butted heads,
but at the end of the day,

05:57.672 --> 05:59.706
we respected each other.

06:00.441 --> 06:02.220
He was true blue Chicago.

06:02.944 --> 06:05.312
You're talking about him
in the past tense, Brian.

06:12.887 --> 06:15.655
Mrs. Price, I just wanted
you to know I'm very...

06:15.690 --> 06:17.424
I don't know how you keep
from punching him.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.095
Like you said,
we're playing the long game.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.634
Well, we know that Ray Price
was shot from a distance.

06:27.668 --> 06:30.871
The problem is we don't know
where the trigger was pulled.

06:30.905 --> 06:32.439
It'll be hard tracking the trajectory.

06:32.473 --> 06:34.141
The bullet's still lodged
in Price's shoulder.

06:34.175 --> 06:36.911
No direct-eyeball witnesses,
no shot spotter PODs.

06:36.946 --> 06:38.798
We pulled all surveillance.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.042
As for motive...

06:40.076 --> 06:41.301
He's black.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.183
There's that.

06:43.217 --> 06:44.851
He's also ahead in the polls.

06:44.886 --> 06:46.853
There's a lot of people that
don't want him to be mayor.

06:46.888 --> 06:48.321
You know, if this is a straight-up

06:48.356 --> 06:50.123
assassination attempt
of a public official,

06:50.158 --> 06:51.858
we're stepping into FBI territory.

06:51.893 --> 06:53.560
Look, we still don't know
what it is for sure

06:53.594 --> 06:55.295
so we treat it like any other case.

06:55.329 --> 06:58.999
Get a list of suspects, anyone
who might be targeting Price.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.234
Hospital detail just called from Med.

07:01.269 --> 07:04.137
Ray Price is out of surgery
in stable condition.

07:04.172 --> 07:07.841
No major damage.
The guy is one tough SOB.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.643
Well, that's great news, Trudy.

07:09.677 --> 07:11.311
I also went through all the 911 calls

07:11.345 --> 07:13.480
pertaining to threats made against Price.

07:13.514 --> 07:15.649
A lot of racial slurs.

07:15.683 --> 07:17.150
Brick through his house window,

07:17.185 --> 07:19.319
his car was tagged with
the N-word last year.

07:19.353 --> 07:22.589
It's an ugly list,
but nothing actionable.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.159
But there was one incident
report that stuck out.

07:26.194 --> 07:27.542
It was a week ago.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.063
A man was seen in Price's yard
having what was described

07:30.097 --> 07:31.932
as "a violent argument" with him.

07:31.966 --> 07:35.168
Patrol responded, but Price
refused to file charges.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.204
He said the whole thing was
a misunderstanding.

07:37.238 --> 07:39.568
Who made the 911 call?

07:41.742 --> 07:43.343
There she is.

07:43.377 --> 07:44.823
Hey, Jasmine.

07:45.446 --> 07:47.280
Heard the great news about your dad?

07:47.315 --> 07:49.950
Yeah, there's nobody
stronger than my dad.

07:49.984 --> 07:52.219
Nobody more particular
about their food either.

07:52.253 --> 07:54.554
Got to make sure he has
something proper when he wakes.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.690
Ah, listen, we wanted to ask you

07:56.724 --> 07:58.391
about a 911 call you made last week.

07:58.426 --> 08:00.860
You reported a man who
threatened to kill your father?

08:02.063 --> 08:04.030
Oh, yeah, that was a misunderstanding.

08:04.065 --> 08:06.733
Really? Because the officers
interviewed your neighbors.

08:06.767 --> 08:08.902
They also reported hearing
a violent argument

08:08.936 --> 08:10.971
from inside your house.

08:11.005 --> 08:13.206
There is always people
knocking at our door.

08:13.241 --> 08:16.610
My father tries, but you can't
please all the people

08:16.644 --> 08:18.245
all the time, right?

08:18.279 --> 08:20.198
Jasmine, the only reason
you're going to make a call

08:20.232 --> 08:21.715
like that is 'cause you're scared.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.042
Why don't you tell us what happened?

08:29.824 --> 08:31.620
I don't know his name,

08:32.159 --> 08:35.160
but he's been to the house a few times.

08:35.196 --> 08:36.249
Okay.

08:36.931 --> 08:38.732
He said he was going to kill my father.

08:48.476 --> 08:49.976
There he is.

08:50.011 --> 08:51.214
Hey.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.247
When I said I would take
a bullet for this city,

08:54.282 --> 08:55.769
I didn't mean it literally.

08:57.018 --> 08:58.885
It's good to see you, Ray.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.023
Did you catch the son of a bitch?

09:03.057 --> 09:05.792
Not yet. I need your help.

09:07.128 --> 09:08.595
Why don't you tell me about this man

09:08.629 --> 09:10.263
who came by your house last week?

09:10.298 --> 09:11.865
Oh, that was nothing.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.301
Well, your daughter said
he threatened to kill you.

09:15.803 --> 09:17.671
It's one of those things, Hank.

09:17.705 --> 09:18.872
You try to do the right thing

09:18.906 --> 09:20.907
and it turns out to be the wrong way.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.410
What's going on, Ray?

09:25.479 --> 09:27.547
I met a guy from Canaryville.

09:27.581 --> 09:30.817
Yeah, uh, you know, a wannabe developer,

09:30.851 --> 09:33.653
lighting cigars with $50 bills,
you know the type.

09:33.688 --> 09:35.288
Hmm.

09:35.323 --> 09:38.958
So I encouraged him to buy some buildings

09:38.993 --> 09:41.995
in a transitional neighborhood.

09:43.331 --> 09:44.497
It was supposed to gentrify

09:44.532 --> 09:46.236
but the zoning didn't come through

09:47.268 --> 09:48.822
and he got screwed.

09:49.837 --> 09:52.172
He's expecting me to make him whole.

09:54.175 --> 09:56.376
Why didn't you reach out to the police?

09:57.244 --> 09:59.646
I was planning on dealing with the matter

09:59.680 --> 10:01.181
at a future date.

10:01.215 --> 10:02.349
Oh.

10:02.383 --> 10:03.781
You mean after the election.

10:03.816 --> 10:07.020
Yeah, like I said, I'm on an upswing.

10:07.922 --> 10:09.356
There's no profit in shining light

10:09.390 --> 10:11.825
on how business is actually
done in this town.

10:11.859 --> 10:12.971
I get it.

10:14.195 --> 10:17.364
Listen, I do need a name though, Ray.

10:26.307 --> 10:28.908
So, Mike, according to your file,

10:28.943 --> 10:31.044
you're the registered owner
of three guns.

10:31.078 --> 10:33.413
Last time I checked, we
still had a second amendment.

10:33.447 --> 10:35.215
And a long range rifle.

10:35.249 --> 10:36.716
I'm a hunter.

10:36.751 --> 10:38.685
Did you go hunting yesterday?

10:38.719 --> 10:39.753
No.

10:43.491 --> 10:45.295
That's your car, Mike.

10:46.127 --> 10:48.695
It was parked a block away
from the Boys and Girls Center

10:48.729 --> 10:50.263
where Ray Price was shot.

10:50.297 --> 10:51.297
So what?

10:51.332 --> 10:53.767
Okay, look, we know you went
to Ray Price's house

10:53.801 --> 10:55.034
and threatened to kill him.

10:55.069 --> 10:56.369
We have witnesses.

10:56.404 --> 10:58.204
We also have looked through
your social media.

10:58.239 --> 11:00.874
Your hatred for Ray Price
is very well documented.

11:00.908 --> 11:03.276
My hatred is justified.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.445
Price is a con man.

11:05.479 --> 11:07.380
Got me to put all my money
into that neighborhood,

11:07.415 --> 11:11.050
got me to donate even more
money to his so-called charity.

11:11.085 --> 11:13.239
He said a Hilton was coming.

11:13.921 --> 11:15.588
A Hilton.

11:15.623 --> 11:18.258
I lost my business, my wife.

11:18.292 --> 11:19.959
Now this sleaze bag's running for mayor?

11:19.994 --> 11:22.796
Then what were you doing
at the dedication?

11:25.699 --> 11:27.734
Whenever Price goes out in public,

11:27.768 --> 11:29.836
I want him to look out and see my face

11:29.870 --> 11:31.883
and remind him I ain't going nowhere,

11:32.506 --> 11:34.174
but I didn't shoot him.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.513
I was getting a coffee
when I heard it happen.

11:36.811 --> 11:38.723
- When you heard it?
- Yeah.

11:39.714 --> 11:41.715
Clear as day, came from right behind me.

11:46.220 --> 11:47.987
This is the third building.

11:48.022 --> 11:49.422
Are you sure his alibi checks out?

11:49.457 --> 11:51.424
Yeah, Rankin was at the 7-11 downstairs

11:51.459 --> 11:52.492
when the shooting happened.

11:56.797 --> 12:00.300
Bingo, right there. Shell casing.

12:02.397 --> 12:04.398
This was his perch.

12:09.042 --> 12:11.410
Yeah, this is perfect.

12:11.545 --> 12:14.280
You've got no security cameras,
no people,

12:14.315 --> 12:16.282
elevated position to paint
his target in the crosshairs,

12:16.317 --> 12:18.818
and then after the shot, easy getaway.

12:18.853 --> 12:20.453
Oh, yeah. Good one.

12:20.488 --> 12:22.896
I'll call the crime lab
and get 'em up here.

12:25.226 --> 12:27.126
Let's talk to building security.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.695
So he came down these stairs here

12:28.729 --> 12:31.064
and then he took off running
and I told him to stop.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.799
Age, height, weight?

12:32.833 --> 12:33.900
Ah, he was black.

12:33.934 --> 12:35.401
That's all you've got?

12:35.436 --> 12:37.403
Uh, I... I didn't... didn't get
a good look at his face.

12:37.438 --> 12:40.139
I mean, he had on a backpack.
I chased him down here.

12:40.174 --> 12:43.176
He struggled, he came up, pulled away,

12:43.210 --> 12:44.711
and went over this fence.

12:44.745 --> 12:47.542
Came down hard on the other side though.

12:49.783 --> 12:51.217
That's as far as you went?

12:51.252 --> 12:53.019
I work for minimum wage
with no benefits, bro.

12:53.053 --> 12:54.521
I don't do fences.

12:54.555 --> 12:56.589
Alderman Price was shot
a block away from here.

12:56.624 --> 12:57.657
You know that right?

12:57.691 --> 12:58.858
Oh, I found that out later.

12:58.893 --> 13:00.193
Nah, I work down here where it's loud,

13:00.227 --> 13:01.661
so I didn't hear any shooting.

13:01.695 --> 13:03.263
I just thought he was stealing.

13:03.297 --> 13:05.439
Check it out. He must've dropped it.

13:05.473 --> 13:07.000
Do you know which direction he went?

13:07.034 --> 13:09.669
I don't know; he jumped
into a car and drove away.

13:09.703 --> 13:10.898
What kind of car?

13:11.472 --> 13:12.483
Green.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.275
All right, what do we got?

13:15.309 --> 13:17.110
What we know is that our offender

13:17.144 --> 13:18.529
was an African American male.

13:18.563 --> 13:20.823
Unknown height, weight, age
but he was carrying a backpack,

13:20.858 --> 13:22.582
which suggests that he was
using a collapsible,

13:22.616 --> 13:23.916
long-range rifle.

13:23.951 --> 13:26.853
Fled in a green car.
Unknown year, make, or model.

13:26.887 --> 13:28.721
All right, we got anything on the phone?

13:28.756 --> 13:30.423
Uh, pay-as-you-go burner.

13:30.457 --> 13:33.526
It was activated yesterday,
no incoming or outgoing calls

13:33.561 --> 13:34.861
but he did keep it on

13:34.895 --> 13:36.529
so we were able to triangulate
his movements.

13:36.564 --> 13:38.097
Right, so let's talk about what we know.

13:38.132 --> 13:41.234
Uh, he was at Bridgeport at 7:15 a.m.

13:41.268 --> 13:44.370
Went up to Uptown for an hour
all the way to Berwyn.

13:44.405 --> 13:45.905
Next thing you know...

13:45.940 --> 13:47.206
Boys and Girls Center.

13:47.241 --> 13:49.042
I talked to Price's ward office.

13:49.076 --> 13:50.209
He was home all morning.

13:50.244 --> 13:51.711
Those routes don't sync up to him.

13:51.745 --> 13:54.481
Look, there's got to be something
significant with these locations

13:54.515 --> 13:56.522
or was the shooter
just driving around randomly?

13:56.556 --> 13:57.862
It wasn't random.

13:59.153 --> 14:01.454
That's my house in Bridgeport.

14:01.488 --> 14:05.058
I had breakfast in Uptown,
met a C.I. in Berwyn,

14:05.092 --> 14:07.260
before I went to the Boys and Girls Club.

14:14.335 --> 14:16.214
Price wasn't the target.

14:17.438 --> 14:18.805
You were.

14:26.310 --> 14:28.310
We were able to cobble together footage

14:28.345 --> 14:30.468
of all the locations you traveled to
before the shootings.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.381
So this is your neighborhood,

14:32.416 --> 14:34.150
that's where you had breakfast
at TJ's Diner,

14:34.184 --> 14:36.843
and that's where you met
your C.I. in Berwyn.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.102
The security guard said that
he saw our offender fleeing

14:39.137 --> 14:40.384
in a green car.

14:40.737 --> 14:42.441
In each of these locations,

14:42.475 --> 14:46.364
there, there, and right there
we see the same green Toyota.

14:46.389 --> 14:49.090
So he could've shot you
at any one of these places.

14:50.226 --> 14:51.874
Why did he wait?

14:53.162 --> 14:54.663
Well, if he's shooting from a distance,

14:54.697 --> 14:56.531
he probably doesn't want to be exposed

14:56.566 --> 14:59.501
and none of those spots
would've been an easy shot.

14:59.535 --> 15:02.370
But he had plenty of time to
set up at the dedication.

15:02.405 --> 15:04.539
- He just missed.
- All right, check it out.

15:04.574 --> 15:06.408
Car is registered to a Melvin Barnes.

15:06.442 --> 15:08.577
He's 42 years old,
no run-ins with the police.

15:08.611 --> 15:10.912
He's employed as a prison guard
out at Stateville.

15:10.947 --> 15:12.347
Ring a bell?

15:12.381 --> 15:13.815
I don't know him.

15:13.849 --> 15:15.483
The car comes back
to a Southside address.

15:15.518 --> 15:16.985
It's a rear garden apartment.

15:17.019 --> 15:18.920
All right, if this guy was
a correction officer,

15:18.955 --> 15:20.388
it means he's probably armed.

15:20.423 --> 15:21.823
I want you going in heavy.

15:34.937 --> 15:36.085
Good?

15:38.874 --> 15:40.241
Blood.

15:48.284 --> 15:50.308
Looks like he was
just bringing home breakfast.

15:50.953 --> 15:52.354
Took one in the back of the head.

15:53.756 --> 15:55.757
Similar to the way Price was shot.

15:55.791 --> 15:59.227
A .308 round fired from
a distance, elevated angle.

15:59.261 --> 16:00.629
Building on the left.

16:00.663 --> 16:03.198
All right, check it out.
We're looking for, um...

16:03.232 --> 16:05.633
Witnesses, casings, prints?
Jay and Hailey are on it.

16:05.668 --> 16:06.677
Cool. Yeah?

16:06.702 --> 16:08.603
Hey, so a neighbor saw
Melvin's green Toyota

16:08.638 --> 16:10.372
pulling out of the alley at 7:00 a.m.,

16:10.406 --> 16:11.773
but Melvin wasn't driving.

16:11.807 --> 16:13.927
- All right, get a BOLO on the vehicle.
- Done.

16:13.961 --> 16:16.144
M.E.'s preliminary time
of death estimated

16:16.178 --> 16:18.313
at 6:30 this morning.

16:18.347 --> 16:20.882
Okay, so shooter kills Melvin,

16:20.916 --> 16:22.784
comes down from his perch,

16:22.818 --> 16:25.553
takes the keys from the dead man's hands,

16:25.588 --> 16:27.589
steals the car, starts following me.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.290
Patrol's got eyes on the green Toyota.

16:29.325 --> 16:30.959
It's parked in a garage at
State Street and 43rd.

16:30.993 --> 16:33.294
There's no sign of the driver
but the engine's still warm.

16:33.329 --> 16:35.063
It's right next to the courthouse.

16:35.097 --> 16:37.187
The shooter's targeting people
in the criminal justice system.

16:37.222 --> 16:38.881
Prison guards, police officer.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.196
The courthouse has got to be next

16:40.231 --> 16:41.377
and it's five minutes out from here.

16:41.411 --> 16:42.677
Let's move.

16:49.011 --> 16:51.360
If he's gonna take a shot, it'll
be from one of the buildings.

16:51.394 --> 16:52.916
All right, so let's get
these people inside.

16:52.950 --> 16:54.882
Get into a building now.
Come on, come on.

16:54.917 --> 16:57.285
Folks, we need you to clear
the area, get inside.

17:02.191 --> 17:03.591
Get inside!

17:03.626 --> 17:05.426
Head down, head down, shots fired!

17:05.461 --> 17:07.095
Get inside the building.
Come on, I got you.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.597
Get inside!

17:09.632 --> 17:10.685
Man down! You got me?

17:10.720 --> 17:12.367
- I got you.
- Sir, are you all right?

17:12.401 --> 17:13.835
Sir, we're coming to you.

17:13.868 --> 17:15.336
On three. One, two, three.

17:15.371 --> 17:18.640
Get inside! Get her inside!

17:18.674 --> 17:20.141
He's up there!

17:22.411 --> 17:24.546
5021 Henry, we have
the shooter on a rooftop

17:24.579 --> 17:25.780
across from the courthouse!

17:25.815 --> 17:28.571
- Come on, bro.
- Let's go.

17:42.064 --> 17:43.298
There he is! Stop!

17:43.332 --> 17:44.799
Get away, out of the way.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.034
Police, don't move!

17:46.068 --> 17:48.703
Offender headed northbound
on the east alley of Dearborn.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.705
Male, black, gray jacket, black backpack.

17:52.174 --> 17:54.042
Chicago PD!

17:54.076 --> 17:55.543
Keep moving! Go, go, go!

17:55.578 --> 17:57.045
Get down! Get out of the way!

17:57.079 --> 17:59.347
5021 Davis, shots fired!
Officers in pursuit!

17:59.381 --> 18:01.049
- Get down!
- Everybody out!

18:04.754 --> 18:06.588
Keep going, Kev. I'll stay with her.

18:06.622 --> 18:08.556
Get that son of a bitch. Go, Goo!

18:08.591 --> 18:13.027
Okay.

18:13.062 --> 18:15.897
5021 Frank, got another one
down, it's a female.

18:15.931 --> 18:17.932
Offender's fleeing westbound
from the alley.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.067
Officers still in pursuit.

18:19.101 --> 18:20.416
<i>Copy that.</i>

18:33.949 --> 18:37.752
5021 David, offender fled
to unknown direction

18:37.787 --> 18:38.853
on 18th street.

18:38.888 --> 18:42.223
Alert all units, he shed
his backpack and his jacket.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.274
No eyes.

18:48.846 --> 18:50.612
Thanks. Hey, hey.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.609
So I just talked to the patrol officers

18:52.643 --> 18:54.478
that are securing the parameter.

18:54.512 --> 18:56.646
No one has passed through
that matches the description.

18:56.681 --> 18:58.248
The prick changed his clothes and got by.

18:58.282 --> 19:00.712
I found a security camera
facing the building.

19:00.746 --> 19:02.191
But it is, of course, broken.

19:02.216 --> 19:03.783
The man who was shot
took one at the chest

19:03.817 --> 19:05.082
but it looks like he's going to make it.

19:05.117 --> 19:06.586
He's a judge named Sam Anderson.

19:06.620 --> 19:08.248
All right, I know Judge Anderson.

19:08.902 --> 19:10.135
So there's got to be a nexus

19:10.170 --> 19:12.437
between the judge,
the prison guard, and me.

19:12.472 --> 19:13.829
Let's work that.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.297
All right, keep combing
for witnesses, Hailey.

19:15.332 --> 19:16.388
Yeah.

19:20.537 --> 19:22.405
Look at this.

19:22.979 --> 19:25.274
We interrupt this shooting
for a political statement.

19:28.912 --> 19:31.747
- Isn't that your friend?
- Yeah.

19:31.782 --> 19:34.417
He may know something. I'll
meet you back at the District.

19:34.451 --> 19:35.825
Sure.

19:37.601 --> 19:40.222
Same MO, same caliber rounds,
same shooter.

19:40.257 --> 19:43.526
His intended targets were a prison guard,

19:43.560 --> 19:44.894
a judge, and a cop.

19:44.928 --> 19:46.896
Exactly, so we know
he's going after people

19:46.930 --> 19:48.497
in the criminal justice system, but why?

19:48.532 --> 19:50.599
There's got to be some sort
of personal grievance

19:50.634 --> 19:51.867
that connects all of you.

19:51.902 --> 19:53.502
Do you have any insight, Sarge?

19:53.537 --> 19:55.104
I've gone through my records.

19:55.138 --> 19:58.240
I've arrested 242 African American males

19:58.275 --> 20:00.843
in the last ten years that have
come before Judge Anderson

20:00.877 --> 20:02.344
- and, uh...
- It's like a hundred...

20:02.379 --> 20:05.081
187 of them are back out on the street.

20:05.115 --> 20:06.281
Yo, Sarge,

20:06.315 --> 20:08.017
me and Ruzek just left the crime lab,

20:08.051 --> 20:10.686
They dissembled the rifle that
we found in the backpack.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.954
It was registered to a Drew Bayless.

20:11.988 --> 20:13.255
He did two tours in Afghanistan.

20:13.290 --> 20:14.390
He's got a purple heart.

20:14.424 --> 20:16.025
- Got his file right here.
- Okay.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.460
Looks like he's had a tough reentry.

20:17.494 --> 20:20.596
Restraining orders,
D&D, resisting arrest.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.150
Huh.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.134
Recognize that face?

20:25.168 --> 20:26.936
I do not.

20:26.970 --> 20:28.971
Well, it's enough for a warrant.

20:29.005 --> 20:30.272
Go pick him up.

20:30.307 --> 20:31.941
Antonio, you hang back with me and Kim.

20:31.975 --> 20:33.909
Let's go through these files,
find a nexus.

20:42.285 --> 20:43.742
Right here.

20:45.188 --> 20:47.389
Drew Bayless, Chicago PD.

20:49.292 --> 20:51.327
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get back in your apartment.

20:51.361 --> 20:52.418
That idiot isn't here.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.096
- You know Bayless?
- I'm his landlord.

20:54.131 --> 20:55.564
When's the last time you've seen him?

20:55.599 --> 20:57.099
Uh, a few days ago.

20:57.134 --> 20:58.434
Wouldn't surprise me if he's in trouble.

20:58.468 --> 21:01.604
He's a prickly guy and a pain in the ass.

21:01.638 --> 21:03.405
Drew Bayless.

21:04.941 --> 21:08.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:08.044 --> 21:09.945
Just keep your hands where
I can see them, Mr. Bayless.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.348
Why don't you get up against
that wall over there?

21:16.219 --> 21:17.820
Well, looking at your record, Drew,

21:17.854 --> 21:19.321
you seem like a smart guy.

21:19.356 --> 21:22.291
College education,
high marks in the military.

21:22.325 --> 21:24.927
So you got to know the dumbest
thing you can possibly do

21:24.961 --> 21:26.428
is run away from a cop.

21:26.463 --> 21:28.797
I wasn't running away.

21:28.832 --> 21:30.432
I was choosing to avoid a conversation

21:30.467 --> 21:31.934
with Chicago police.

21:31.968 --> 21:34.036
I'm seeing all the trouble
you've been keeping up with

21:34.070 --> 21:35.604
since you left the military.

21:35.639 --> 21:37.373
You've got a good reason to.

21:37.407 --> 21:40.609
Thank you for your service.
Now take out the garbage.

21:41.344 --> 21:44.847
This country don't give
a damn about its soldiers.

21:45.407 --> 21:47.249
That's why you're shooting at cops, huh?

21:50.875 --> 21:52.148
Not sure what you're talking about.

21:52.182 --> 21:53.222
No?

21:57.618 --> 21:59.828
You're the registered owner
of that rifle.

22:00.830 --> 22:01.964
Yeah, that's right.

22:01.998 --> 22:03.465
Well, it was used this morning

22:03.500 --> 22:05.968
to murder Melvin Barnes,
a retired prison guard.

22:06.002 --> 22:07.169
Took a shot at me too.

22:07.204 --> 22:09.838
Look, not to sound conceited,

22:09.873 --> 22:11.073
if I had taken a shot at you,

22:11.107 --> 22:12.498
you wouldn't be sitting here right now.

22:12.533 --> 22:15.744
Drew, your weapon was just
used in three shootings

22:15.779 --> 22:17.479
including one homicide.

22:17.514 --> 22:20.749
Superintendent of the police
is looking to crucify somebody

22:20.784 --> 22:22.116
and right now...

22:22.886 --> 22:25.354
you're all we got.

22:25.388 --> 22:29.214
So if you are smart,
you'll start talking.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.193
It wasn't me.

22:31.228 --> 22:32.835
I swear.

22:33.863 --> 22:35.864
I just got back from Wisconsin today.

22:35.899 --> 22:37.233
I was hunting.

22:37.267 --> 22:38.867
Who else would have access to your guns?

22:38.902 --> 22:40.369
Nobody!

22:42.906 --> 22:44.928
Somebody must've stolen it
when I was gone.

22:47.777 --> 22:49.511
All right, thank you.

22:49.546 --> 22:50.846
- Uh, boss?
- Yeah?

22:50.880 --> 22:52.348
Drew Bayless' story checks out.

22:52.382 --> 22:54.583
He was at the Badger Lodge
for the last four days.

22:54.618 --> 22:56.385
Looks like he's telling the truth.

22:56.419 --> 22:58.721
I got surveillance footage
from Bayless's building.

22:58.755 --> 23:00.195
Here, can you run this?

23:03.912 --> 23:06.280
So this is from three days ago.

23:11.314 --> 23:13.782
And then five minutes later.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.614
Familiar to you, Sarge?

23:20.076 --> 23:21.210
I don't think so.

23:21.244 --> 23:22.645
Ran facial rec. I got an ID.

23:22.679 --> 23:23.969
Okay.

23:24.948 --> 23:26.638
Darius Tatum.

23:28.418 --> 23:30.452
Okay, I'm wrong. I do know him.

23:30.487 --> 23:32.254
Found him.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.825
Yup.

23:36.860 --> 23:39.561
Look at that.

23:39.596 --> 23:42.431
I arrested this kid. He was 17.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.268
He was lookout on an armed robbery...

23:46.714 --> 23:48.554
I mean, looking at serious time.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.621
I flipped him.

23:51.789 --> 23:54.583
I mean, he helped us put away
some very bad people.

23:55.779 --> 23:57.246
I got him a deal.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.014
I mean, he was supposed
to do six months in juvie,

23:59.049 --> 24:00.249
walk away with a clean slate.

24:00.283 --> 24:01.828
That didn't happen, boss.

24:01.863 --> 24:03.644
It looks like Darius
had a really hard time

24:03.678 --> 24:04.785
getting out of the system.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.588
He went from juvie
straight to Stateville.

24:06.623 --> 24:07.990
He was incarcerated for ten years.

24:08.024 --> 24:09.425
He just got out last year.

24:09.459 --> 24:11.721
Let me tell you something,
Darius was a good kid.

24:11.755 --> 24:13.829
I mean, something happened to him.

24:13.863 --> 24:15.664
You stay inside long enough,

24:15.699 --> 24:18.100
it's going to take the good
out of anybody.

24:28.243 --> 24:29.943
Have a seat.

24:30.797 --> 24:32.345
Sit down.

24:39.044 --> 24:42.022
You have 30 seconds
to tell me everything you know

24:42.056 --> 24:44.324
about Darius Tatum.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.294
I don't know anything.

24:48.329 --> 24:50.430
Hey, you already played that card.

24:51.682 --> 24:54.257
We have you on the record
visiting him at Stateville.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.645
- That was a long time ago.
- No, that was a year ago.

24:58.113 --> 25:00.347
We know he didn't just rob
your house randomly.

25:00.382 --> 25:03.541
He knew you had guns.
You're protecting him.

25:03.576 --> 25:05.352
Well, somebody should have protected him!

25:05.387 --> 25:06.620
Hey, hey, easy. Easy.

25:06.655 --> 25:09.456
Hey, it's okay.

25:09.491 --> 25:11.125
Good.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.628
So talk to me.

25:17.899 --> 25:19.700
Somebody should have protected him.

25:22.671 --> 25:24.464
'Cause he was a good kid

25:25.040 --> 25:26.967
and you guys crushed him.

25:27.342 --> 25:30.210
Yeah. You crushed him!

25:34.349 --> 25:35.649
Tell me what happened.

25:44.359 --> 25:47.105
I used to date Darius's
sister; that's how I know him.

25:47.139 --> 25:48.962
- Okay.
- All right?

25:48.997 --> 25:51.031
When he got out,
I took him under my wing.

25:51.066 --> 25:52.632
You taught him how to shoot a rifle?

25:52.666 --> 25:54.568
Yeah, to shoot but not to kill anybody.

25:58.039 --> 26:01.752
See, Darius always wanted
to join the army, man.

26:02.377 --> 26:05.012
That was his dream,
to fight for his country.

26:07.048 --> 26:08.842
I always thought that was ironic,

26:09.184 --> 26:11.178
seeing what his country did to him.

26:12.220 --> 26:13.420
All right.

26:16.057 --> 26:18.659
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.763
I saw him two weeks ago.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.774
He just got back from
the Recruiting Office.

26:24.899 --> 26:26.568
Of course, they rejected him...

26:28.737 --> 26:30.364
On account of his felony.

26:32.774 --> 26:35.075
He was in so much pain, man.

26:37.912 --> 26:39.713
He lost his hope.

26:44.119 --> 26:47.821
Check with his mother.
Sometimes he crashes there.

26:50.592 --> 26:52.511
Get patrol to take him home.

26:53.561 --> 26:54.846
Yeah.

26:55.236 --> 26:57.237
Thank you.

27:07.442 --> 27:08.944
Chicago PD!

27:09.944 --> 27:12.412
Mrs. Tatum, I'm Sergeant Hank Voight.

27:12.447 --> 27:14.114
Can you open the door, please?

27:14.149 --> 27:16.083
- Is your son Darius here?
- No.

27:16.117 --> 27:17.410
When's the last time you saw him?

27:17.445 --> 27:19.086
He's been staying with friends.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.754
He came to visit me two days ago,

27:20.789 --> 27:22.890
but I haven't talked to him since then.

27:23.691 --> 27:25.425
Is Darius the one who shot that judge?

27:25.460 --> 27:26.927
Did he say something about that?

27:26.961 --> 27:30.364
No, but he hated Judge Anderson.

27:31.199 --> 27:32.800
He's the one that sent him to Stateville

27:32.834 --> 27:34.601
on his 18th birthday.

27:34.636 --> 27:36.804
I didn't have the means
to stop it from happening.

27:36.838 --> 27:38.405
I'm sorry it went down that way.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.407
That doesn't change a damn thing.

27:40.441 --> 27:41.675
He deserved better.

27:41.709 --> 27:45.078
I agree. I like Darius.

27:45.113 --> 27:47.014
But right now, the entire police force

27:47.048 --> 27:48.692
is out there hunting for him.

27:49.150 --> 27:51.862
Our best shot at finding him alive

27:52.487 --> 27:54.239
is you helping us.

27:54.556 --> 27:56.190
He used my computer.

27:56.224 --> 27:57.624
All right.

27:57.659 --> 27:59.626
All right, I went through
the search history

27:59.661 --> 28:01.328
from two days ago when Darius was here.

28:01.362 --> 28:03.964
He googled Melvin Barnes.
He got his address.

28:03.998 --> 28:05.365
He googled you, Hank Voight,

28:05.400 --> 28:07.134
and he did a deep dive on Judge Anderson.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.502
Now there's one more name here.

28:08.536 --> 28:09.748
A Michael Willard,

28:09.782 --> 28:11.689
director of the Belmont Youth
Intervention Center.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.707
It's a, uh, trade school
for at-risk kids.

28:13.741 --> 28:15.376
All right, call the center,
give them a warning.

28:15.411 --> 28:16.543
You're too late, Sarge.

28:16.578 --> 28:18.178
Shots fired at the
Youth Intervention Center.

28:18.213 --> 28:19.813
It's on lockdown.
It's all over city-wide.

28:19.848 --> 28:21.315
Have the team meet us there.

28:21.349 --> 28:23.050
Please, let me go with you.
I can talk to Darius.

28:23.084 --> 28:24.816
- No, that is not possible.
- He'll listen to me.

28:24.850 --> 28:27.621
My son trusted you people!
He did everything you asked.

28:27.655 --> 28:30.776
He wouldn't be in this
situation if it wasn't for you.

28:48.042 --> 28:49.977
Hey, move, move, move! Hey, move!

28:50.011 --> 28:51.411
Come on, come on! Get in, get in!

28:52.580 --> 28:53.847
Come on.

29:00.221 --> 29:02.656
So I was getting out of my
car, my windshield exploded.

29:02.690 --> 29:04.358
I... I dove under the car.

29:04.392 --> 29:06.526
I saw Tatum coming and, um,
yeah, he was going to kill me

29:06.561 --> 29:08.195
but the guard shot him.

29:08.229 --> 29:10.264
Okay, how bad was he hit?
Ah, he's shot in the leg

29:10.298 --> 29:11.698
but, uh, he's holed up in the Rec Room.

29:11.733 --> 29:12.900
Won't let anyone in or out.

29:12.934 --> 29:14.368
How many people in there with him?

29:14.402 --> 29:16.870
I don't know, five? Maybe less.

29:16.905 --> 29:18.538
Why do you think he came after you?

29:18.573 --> 29:21.441
I was his supervisor at the
Juvenile Detention Facility.

29:21.476 --> 29:24.711
All right, this... this kid, he's
given me nothing but problems.

29:29.817 --> 29:31.685
That a direct line in the Rec Room?

29:31.719 --> 29:33.053
Yeah.

29:35.223 --> 29:37.024
<i>- Darius!</i>

29:39.427 --> 29:41.361
Darius, nobody wants to hurt you, man!

29:41.396 --> 29:43.063
We just need you to pick up the phone!

29:49.938 --> 29:51.204
Darius!

29:52.607 --> 29:54.274
<i>Who is it?</i>

29:54.309 --> 29:56.076
Sergeant Hank Voight.

29:56.110 --> 29:58.612
<i>Hank Voight? It's been a minute.</i>

29:58.646 --> 30:03.050
<i>A long, ugly minute, but I got
nothing to say to you.</i>

30:03.084 --> 30:04.484
<i>Hell, I tried to kill you.</i>

30:04.519 --> 30:06.038
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you missed

30:06.073 --> 30:08.789
because I'm the one
who's going to get you out

30:08.823 --> 30:10.290
of this situation, Darius.

30:10.325 --> 30:11.792
<i>Ain't no getting out of this.</i>

30:11.826 --> 30:13.627
<i>I know that.</i>

30:13.661 --> 30:16.797
<i>Just give me Willard and I'll
let these three boys go.</i>

30:16.831 --> 30:19.466
I can't do that.
Michael Willard isn't here.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.667
<i>Not here?</i>

30:20.702 --> 30:23.337
<i>What, he hiding like a little bitch?</i>

30:23.371 --> 30:25.172
<i>'Cause that's what he is.</i>

30:25.206 --> 30:29.643
<i>A weak-ass cowardly bitch who
beats up scared little boys.</i>

30:31.813 --> 30:34.114
How 'bout you take me instead?

30:34.148 --> 30:36.234
<i>You want me to kill you instead of him?</i>

30:37.151 --> 30:39.529
I want you to give up those three boys

30:40.154 --> 30:41.781
and I want you to let me help you.

30:42.357 --> 30:43.992
<i>What, like last time?</i>

30:44.826 --> 30:47.928
<i>That's what got me here
in the first place!</i>

30:47.962 --> 30:50.931
Well, give me another chance.
Let me make it right.

30:50.965 --> 30:52.866
But you got to let those kids go.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.586
They got nothing to do with this.

30:55.136 --> 30:57.077
Darius, come on. Give me five minutes.

30:57.111 --> 30:58.205
Just you and me.

30:58.239 --> 31:00.091
You don't like what I'm saying,

31:01.009 --> 31:02.776
you do what you got to do.

31:02.810 --> 31:06.313
<i>Okay, five minutes,
then I shoot your ass.</i>

31:06.347 --> 31:08.982
Deal, but you got to let those kids go.

31:10.148 --> 31:12.886
Listen, I'm glad you're here.
We just started negotiation.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.655
There aren't going to be
any negotiations, Sergeant.

31:16.123 --> 31:17.690
Sir.

31:18.693 --> 31:19.893
Move.

31:19.927 --> 31:21.128
Take your positions.

31:21.162 --> 31:22.863
Yes, sir. Antonio.

31:23.931 --> 31:25.158
Brian...

31:25.833 --> 31:28.668
he's holding three hostages
with a semiautomatic pistol.

31:28.703 --> 31:31.171
We've tapped into the intercom
so we got ears in the room,

31:31.205 --> 31:33.538
but he is staying clear of those windows.

31:33.563 --> 31:34.730
Good to know,

31:34.755 --> 31:36.652
but we will find a way. We always do.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.818
Sir...

31:38.746 --> 31:40.080
if this thing goes sideways,

31:40.114 --> 31:42.182
we could end up killing innocent kids.

31:42.216 --> 31:43.750
That would not be a good look

31:43.785 --> 31:45.929
for the Chicago Police
Department right about now.

31:46.721 --> 31:48.155
So you propose?

31:48.189 --> 31:50.257
He said he'd give me five minutes.

31:50.291 --> 31:52.225
Let me go in and talk to him.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.187
How do you know he's not gonna shoot you?

31:55.196 --> 31:56.564
I don't.

31:57.479 --> 31:59.146
So what's the plan?

31:59.434 --> 32:00.867
Get Darius talking,

32:00.892 --> 32:02.592
gradually get him to move
toward the window

32:02.637 --> 32:04.905
so the squad can get a clean shot.

32:07.241 --> 32:09.342
You got five minutes.

32:09.377 --> 32:10.870
Be careful out there.

32:14.042 --> 32:15.208
Okay.

32:16.110 --> 32:17.310
Get yourself in the clear.

32:17.344 --> 32:18.812
Offender's a male black.

32:18.846 --> 32:21.147
He's wearing a gray sweatshirt
and blue jeans.

32:24.145 --> 32:26.386
Darius, it's Sergeant Hank Voight.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.454
I'm opening the door. I'm coming in.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.223
I do not have a weapon.

32:41.202 --> 32:42.569
I'm clean.

32:43.204 --> 32:45.004
I'm unarmed.

32:47.708 --> 32:49.442
How about you put your gun down too?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.244
No.

32:52.213 --> 32:54.480
It stays where it is.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.041
Okay, that's cool.

32:56.884 --> 32:59.953
But you've got to let these
kids go now, that's the deal.

33:00.788 --> 33:02.288
Darius.

33:02.743 --> 33:04.577
Come on.

33:05.392 --> 33:06.693
All right, you let them go,

33:06.727 --> 33:08.628
I can get you out of here safely too.

33:08.662 --> 33:10.864
Promises.

33:10.898 --> 33:13.266
Everybody loves making promises.

33:14.068 --> 33:17.136
But then they break 'em,
so what's the damn point?

33:17.171 --> 33:20.039
Darius, you were supposed
to be protected.

33:20.074 --> 33:23.343
In juvie? You kidding me?

33:23.377 --> 33:25.211
When they found out I was a snitch,

33:25.246 --> 33:28.073
they came after me every day.

33:28.649 --> 33:32.385
They beat me and beat me and beat me.

33:32.419 --> 33:33.987
They threw bottles of piss at me!

33:34.021 --> 33:37.056
Why... why didn't you reach out
to your supervisor?

33:37.091 --> 33:38.358
It was Willard who told them

33:38.392 --> 33:40.493
I was a snitch in the first place.

33:41.362 --> 33:44.063
Is that true? What he said?

33:44.098 --> 33:46.633
Of course not.
The kid's a liar and a punk.

33:47.534 --> 33:48.701
He was a cooperating witness.

33:48.736 --> 33:50.236
You were supposed to keep him safe.

33:50.271 --> 33:53.172
Yeah, right, we weren't
running a daycare center, man.

33:53.207 --> 33:56.009
When these kids came in,
they were hardcore criminals.

33:56.043 --> 33:59.879
My only goal was to keep them
from killing each other.

33:59.914 --> 34:00.992
All right?

34:01.026 --> 34:03.049
<i>I was still a kid</i>

34:03.083 --> 34:07.754
<i>and he just turned his back
and let it happen.</i>

34:07.788 --> 34:11.858
Listen, if that is the case,

34:11.891 --> 34:13.993
we can still buy this back.

34:14.027 --> 34:15.561
I never wanted this.

34:17.197 --> 34:18.931
I did what y'all said!

34:18.966 --> 34:21.734
I was supposed to get my life
back and they took it all away!

34:21.768 --> 34:23.937
You could... you could still
get some of it back,

34:23.971 --> 34:26.139
but you got to let these kids go.

34:32.646 --> 34:34.091
Do we have eyes?

34:34.116 --> 34:36.150
We got a partial target
and a confirmed weapon.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.734
- Shut up!
- Listen, there are snipers out there!

34:38.759 --> 34:40.460
They are looking to take you out!

34:40.485 --> 34:42.482
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm trying to save your life!

34:42.507 --> 34:44.013
Do you have the kill shot?

34:47.790 --> 34:48.922
He's blocking me.

34:48.947 --> 34:50.697
Who?

34:50.731 --> 34:52.065
Sergeant Voight.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.199
Oh, come on!

34:55.101 --> 34:56.636
Get your ass back to the door!

34:56.670 --> 34:58.705
- Okay, okay!
- Go!

35:00.007 --> 35:02.942
Darius, we are running out of time, bro.

35:02.977 --> 35:05.278
You got to show an act of good faith now.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.713
Who the hell showed me that?

35:06.747 --> 35:09.048
I get it, I get it,

35:09.083 --> 35:11.317
but you've got to let the hostages go.

35:11.352 --> 35:12.719
Come on.

35:14.288 --> 35:16.456
Let's show them we're moving
in the right direction.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.924
At least it'll buy us some time.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.159
- It's too late.
- No, it is not too late.

35:22.963 --> 35:24.497
Darius, I promised your mother

35:24.531 --> 35:26.232
that I would get you out of here alive.

35:29.470 --> 35:31.529
- You saw my mother?
- Yeah.

35:32.539 --> 35:35.742
She loves you so much.

35:35.776 --> 35:37.410
I know you love her.

35:40.481 --> 35:43.649
Look, if you let them go,
you can see her again.

35:47.821 --> 35:49.255
Darius, what are you doing?

35:49.289 --> 35:52.358
Stop. Just come on.

35:52.393 --> 35:54.227
Let 'em go.

35:55.496 --> 35:58.197
You two, you can go.

35:58.232 --> 35:59.832
No, no. Not you.

35:59.867 --> 36:02.035
Okay, okay. Wait.

36:02.069 --> 36:06.506
I've got to let them know
that they're coming out, okay?

36:07.241 --> 36:11.511
Hey, hands up. Real slow. Take it easy.

36:11.545 --> 36:15.148
Listen, I've got two hostages coming out!

36:15.182 --> 36:17.683
I need you to stand down, do you copy?

36:17.718 --> 36:19.452
- Copy, Sarge.
- All right.

36:19.486 --> 36:20.720
Nice and easy.

36:20.754 --> 36:21.954
- Burgess.
- Come, come out with me.

36:21.989 --> 36:23.456
Come on. We've got you. We've got you.

36:23.490 --> 36:25.892
Come on. We've got you,
we've got you, we've got you.

36:25.926 --> 36:29.395
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

36:31.598 --> 36:33.258
How old are you?

36:33.834 --> 36:35.501
S-seventeen.

36:37.671 --> 36:39.138
What's your name?

36:40.274 --> 36:41.766
Malcolm.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.310
Come on, Darius. He's just a kid.

36:44.344 --> 36:45.687
He's not gonna hurt you.

36:46.547 --> 36:48.273
Take the gun off of him.

36:48.849 --> 36:50.516
Darius, come on.

36:50.551 --> 36:52.251
I'm not going to hurt you.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.477
You know I'm not going to hurt you.

36:57.518 --> 36:58.919
Just put the gun down.

36:58.953 --> 37:01.578
You don't want to do this.
Put the gun down.

37:04.525 --> 37:06.326
That's good.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.529
Darius, look at me.
We are really close now.

37:09.564 --> 37:11.164
All right?

37:11.199 --> 37:14.434
All right, Malcolm, you're
going to come first, okay?

37:14.468 --> 37:18.104
Put your hands over your head,
nice and easy.

37:18.139 --> 37:21.174
Nice and easy and
just walk out real slow.

37:21.209 --> 37:23.210
Real slow.

37:23.244 --> 37:24.678
No! Hey, hey!

37:24.712 --> 37:26.179
Hey, he's a hostage!

37:26.214 --> 37:27.847
- No!
- Stand down!

37:27.882 --> 37:29.482
No, no. I can't! I can't go back!

37:29.517 --> 37:30.664
- Listen to me.
- No.

37:30.699 --> 37:33.263
You and me, we're going to go
to the state attorney's office.

37:33.298 --> 37:34.883
We're going to work out
some sort of deal.

37:34.918 --> 37:36.656
You're lying! They're all lying!

37:36.691 --> 37:37.958
Just like the last time!

37:37.992 --> 37:39.559
Hey, stay away from the window.

37:39.594 --> 37:41.494
Come on, just put the gun on the table.

37:41.529 --> 37:42.910
Walk to me.

37:43.497 --> 37:44.731
We're almost there.

37:44.765 --> 37:47.901
We're there. Come on. Walk to me.

37:50.538 --> 37:53.006
Come on, Darius.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.375
Darius. Come on.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.080
Come on, that's it. That's it.

38:00.114 --> 38:01.748
Tell my mom I'm sorry.

38:01.782 --> 38:03.083
No, Darius, no!

38:03.117 --> 38:04.251
No!

38:46.560 --> 38:47.927
Sergeant, you got a sec?

38:47.962 --> 38:49.195
Yeah.

38:50.398 --> 38:54.134
So I got a pretty bad feeling
about this director Willard.

38:54.168 --> 38:56.136
I talked to a C.I. aligned
with the G-Park Lords.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.571
He said they got this guy
in their pocket.

38:58.606 --> 38:59.739
He's been selling them info,

38:59.774 --> 39:01.074
giving them cooperating witnesses,

39:01.108 --> 39:02.208
doing it for years.

39:02.243 --> 39:03.628
It's enough to build a case.

39:03.662 --> 39:05.979
Good, start with a warrant,
then search his financials.

39:06.013 --> 39:09.215
Let's see how this prick does
on the other side of the bars.

39:14.522 --> 39:15.795
Can I ask you something?

39:16.490 --> 39:17.714
Um...

39:19.552 --> 39:21.586
How did you know Darius
wouldn't shoot you?

39:23.903 --> 39:25.471
I didn't. I just...

39:29.036 --> 39:31.004
Look, I'm the one who
started this ball rolling

39:31.038 --> 39:32.906
and I figured I owed it to him.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.989
I know we do our best
to help these kids, you know.

39:43.984 --> 39:48.355
Put them on a... a conveyer belt,

39:48.389 --> 39:50.824
thinking one day they'll get off, but...

39:56.564 --> 39:58.031
Most of them don't.

40:27.528 --> 40:28.695
For the funeral.

40:38.072 --> 40:39.921
I... I'm sorry.
