00:49.200 --> 00:53.879
Mr. Director, this is
Agent Vivian Delay.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.679
For the last ten years, the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:57.680 --> 01:01.559
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.199
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.039
What we do know is he's a
former German national

01:08.040 --> 01:11.519
who sells atomic material to
terrorists all over the world.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.279
Intelligence confirms that a
transaction is to take place

01:15.280 --> 01:17.999
next week in Belgrade.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.879
The Wolf's number one
man, the Albino,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.367
will be selling a dirty
bomb to Syrian buyers.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.919
<i>We've already dispatched a
team to eliminate the buyers,</i>

01:28.920 --> 01:31.885
<i>secure the bomb, and
apprehend the Albino.</i>

01:34.120 --> 01:36.079
How may I be of service, sir?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.248
Your target is the Wolf.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.686
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.719
Find him and eliminate him.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.159
Yes, sir.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.250
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.159
Oh, sir, if I may,

01:56.160 --> 01:58.442
who is our agent on the ground?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.999
<i>Ethan Renner.</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:03.239
<i>He's a lifer.</i>

02:03.240 --> 02:05.090
<i>He'll get the job done.</i>

02:11.200 --> 02:13.767
The buyers have been neutralized.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.319
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.010
<i>Going down.</i>

02:29.000 --> 02:31.601
Maid service. I have
your extra towels.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.199
This cold is killing me.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.279
- Yeah?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.528
- You left a big mess.
<i>- Yeah, well...</i>

03:01.440 --> 03:04.519
I'm thinking about calling in sick.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.610
<i>Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.</i>

03:24.320 --> 03:26.761
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

03:28.200 --> 03:34.009
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with
those little shampoo bottles, I like them.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.844
All teams in position.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.924
Excuse me.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.360
Nice work in there, my man.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.759
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.199
I need a second to make a call.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.119
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.279
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.165
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.401
Let's see the scan.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.079
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

04:57.080 --> 05:00.999
I don't have any change so if I could
borrow some out of this money.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I can come back and
I can pay you back.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.159
Come on, come on.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.600
Son of a bitch.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.319
All right, this is worth a lot.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.806
I take some of this.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.245
I'm coming back for that.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.848
Excuse me.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.729
Have we met before?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.530
You would remember me, no?

05:51.160 --> 05:53.203
Karachi!

05:54.680 --> 05:57.319
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!

05:57.320 --> 05:59.199
No one moves on the Albino

05:59.200 --> 06:02.399
until we have cleared
what's in the box. Come on.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We met in
Karachi last April exactly.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.719
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress

06:09.720 --> 06:12.241
if I remember it correctly?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.479
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.886
That's a dirty bomb.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.759
<i>Boss.</i>

06:28.760 --> 06:31.008
<i>Abort.</i>

06:59.160 --> 07:01.599
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.559
<i>You didn't forget, which
means you probably love me.</i>

07:04.560 --> 07:05.959
Of course I do, Zooey.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.919
<i>You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday, " loudly.</i>

07:09.920 --> 07:14.199
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.759
<i>You can leave a message
after the beep.</i>

07:17.280 --> 07:18.970
What the f...?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.679
All right.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.679
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

07:25.680 --> 07:26.881
<i>♪ Happy birth...</i>

07:27.320 --> 07:30.569
Go, go! Get in position! Cover me!

07:31.920 --> 07:33.246
<i>♪ ...to you</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:38.644
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Zooey</i>

08:09.680 --> 08:11.644
Cover Ethan now!

08:13.800 --> 08:16.321
We're going in! We're going in!

08:31.640 --> 08:36.083
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

10:04.160 --> 10:07.159
All right, that's enough.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.524
Put it down.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.686
Now.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.999
Now slide it over here.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.079
You're not going to
kill me, are you?

10:21.080 --> 10:23.959
Not unless I have to, all right?

10:23.960 --> 10:27.479
But I'm not running after
you anymore, fucker.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.566
Ohh...

11:08.120 --> 11:10.559
I see you've read the report.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.599
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.839
It's a type of brain cancer and
it's spread to your lungs.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.008
It doesn't say how
much time I have left.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.959
Three months, possibly five.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.367
Yeah.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.359
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.399
I'm afraid not.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.879
I suggest you put your
affairs in order.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.809
Thank you, doctor.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.919
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.519
But now that you're no
longer operational,

11:48.520 --> 11:52.281
we need to terminate
our relationship.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.839
We've wired your pension
into your account.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.646
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.201
What the...?

14:11.360 --> 14:14.159
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

14:14.160 --> 14:17.091
No, I'm American. I...

14:18.240 --> 14:19.799
- I live here.
- Which floor?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.559
No, I mean, I live here.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.359
You? You are the owner?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.244
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.239
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

14:32.240 --> 14:36.279
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.319
My daughter Sumia is in the
kitchen, she's pregnant.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.999
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.919
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.966
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.759
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.119
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.199
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.559
And it is good that you are
finally back. My name is Jules.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.250
Ethan.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.919
Where's all my stuff?

15:06.920 --> 15:09.879
I also started to paint the room.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.159
My wife think it is best
to have a cheerful color.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.759
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.566
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.605
That's months from now.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.159
Then I guess I need to
throw them out myself.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.886
No, no, no, hey, ho.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.599
I'll go to... Hey! I'll go to jail?

15:46.640 --> 15:49.207
All right, what exactly
then am I supposed to do?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.959
Did you really just say that to me?

16:01.120 --> 16:05.644
Ethan, Ethan!

16:07.960 --> 16:09.639
I need to talk to your dad.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.319
Psst!

16:12.320 --> 16:14.841
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

16:19.480 --> 16:24.846
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.999
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.159
I'm not saying you did, but
I think it's time you and I

16:36.160 --> 16:38.479
got to know each other
just a little better.

16:38.480 --> 16:43.049
'Cause you're not just
crashing at some guy's house.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.451
No problem, Ethan. We
will pack and leave now.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.850
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.639
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.171
Sit down.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.638
You don't have to go
yet, Jules, at least...

17:11.640 --> 17:14.445
not until your
daughter has her baby.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.759
But you stay under my rules.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.878
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule #1, no one steps in this room again.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.439
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.199
That's right, you
put a bigger sign.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.319
Rule #2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.439
Yes, of course.

17:35.440 --> 17:40.359
And rule #3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.359
- You don't like the color?
- No.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.359
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.961
No, yellow is not a man's color.

17:49.520 --> 17:53.239
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.205
Like Sumia.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.519
OK, OK, no more yellow.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.879
<i>Who is the most beautiful
girl in the world?</i>

18:20.880 --> 18:22.599
<i>- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!</i>

18:22.600 --> 18:23.879
<i>That is so cute!</i>

18:29.920 --> 18:31.804
<i>Run, run, run!</i>

18:45.040 --> 18:47.279
Hey, <i>salut</i>, Christine.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.164
Hi, you.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.763
Hey.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.119
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.731
I'm in town.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.687
I'm in a meeting right now, so
this is not a good time to talk.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.359
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.679
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

19:20.680 --> 19:23.479
so, uh... unless it's urgent

19:23.480 --> 19:27.439
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.971
Why?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.759
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

19:33.760 --> 19:37.199
No, not today.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.085
All right, I'll meet you outside.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.890
OK, see ya.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.519
Why are we really here, Ethan?

19:54.520 --> 19:56.324
I wanted to see you.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.199
And our daughter, you
want to see her too?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.006
Yes. Yes.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.999
I started a college fund.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.999
Why the sudden interest?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.439
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.449
I left her a message
on her birthday.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.999
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.799
I'm dying, Tina.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.527
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

20:29.480 --> 20:32.411
I'm sick.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.639
I mean, I'm dying.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.759
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

20:40.760 --> 20:44.203
must be signed in both
French and English.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.767
<i>I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.</i>

20:59.080 --> 21:00.441
Come on in.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.439
It's nice.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.119
The place looks better than before.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.159
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.011
I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.487
I want to see her before I go.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.528
You have to make me a promise.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.806
I'll let you see her
under one condition.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.201
Are you done?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.439
Are you really done
working for them?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.564
- Yes.
- Promise me.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.607
Yes. I missed a lot.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.719
I should have left a long time ago.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.599
I'm gonna be fine.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.279
I've got the whole
day planned. First...

22:05.280 --> 22:08.159
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.559
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

22:10.560 --> 22:12.489
Hi.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.566
Hi, Zooey.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.560
How are you?

22:23.520 --> 22:25.759
I'm good, how are you?

22:25.760 --> 22:27.769
I'm good, thank you.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.599
- OK.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.119
No, I'm just... I'll be
back home at 8:30. Yeah?

22:35.120 --> 22:36.719
What are we supposed to do?

22:36.720 --> 22:38.604
All right, how about I cook?

22:39.360 --> 22:40.766
You're on.

22:42.840 --> 22:46.203
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.770
I think I like Dad.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.519
Favorite place to go after school?

22:52.520 --> 22:54.399
I didn't know we had
a favorite place.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.959
Flying chairs, remember?

22:56.960 --> 23:00.079
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

23:00.080 --> 23:02.719
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.119
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.399
Look, I'm not mad
at you, all right?

23:07.400 --> 23:11.079
I don't need you to explain any of
this, all right? It's not a big deal.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.839
Come on, Zoe, let's go to the cafe.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.679
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.159
Who?

23:18.160 --> 23:21.045
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.806
No.

23:26.560 --> 23:31.199
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.879
Sorry, sometimes I
just get a bit nervous

23:34.880 --> 23:37.319
when I see American cowboys.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.799
Yee-haw!

23:39.800 --> 23:41.331
OK.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.199
He's older than you.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.839
Yeah, he's a senior.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.159
Is there something wrong with that?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.399
Back when I was
growing up if you...

23:50.400 --> 23:52.239
Hugh is so different than you.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.239
Look, I know I'm blowing
it here, Zooey, I...

23:55.240 --> 23:57.279
Look, I...

23:57.280 --> 23:59.244
thought you might want
to ride this home.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.039
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.839
It's... so purple.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.439
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.880
Right, when I was like nine.

24:09.881 --> 24:13.119
I'm taking the metro
with my friends.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.121
All right, so I'll see
you at home for dinner?

24:18.680 --> 24:22.362
Zooey, I'll see you
at home for dinner?

25:08.560 --> 25:10.999
- How are these?
- Fresh.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.359
They're fresh? I just need
to steam them, right?

25:13.360 --> 25:15.121
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.239
Milk?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.329
Only if you plan to fry it.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.890
Haven't got that far.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.599
I like a man that doesn't pretend
to know his way around the kitchen.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.199
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.401
Yes...

25:34.520 --> 25:36.210
I think I am.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.559
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

25:42.560 --> 25:44.279
thanks to you, frying
it for my daughter.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.802
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.319
What did you say your name was?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.719
You can call me Vivi.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.730
Nice running into you,
Vivi, but not interested.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.011
Maybe we could talk?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.769
My wife gave me this.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.243
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.328
All right, but my
bike's coming with me.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.044
The bike's going with me.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.479
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

26:44.480 --> 26:46.799
I work for the director of the CIA.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.879
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.319
Serbia was my operation.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.851
I was looking for the Wolf.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.039
We believe he was at
the hotel that day,

26:56.040 --> 26:57.519
and I believe that you
may have seen him.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.799
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

26:59.800 --> 27:02.685
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.039
I want you to come work for me.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.559
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.959
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

27:15.960 --> 27:18.527
for more than just a
few measly months?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.447
Jesus!

27:25.800 --> 27:27.001
That was really close.

27:27.680 --> 27:32.010
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.519
Interested?

27:35.520 --> 27:38.963
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.800
Where's the literature?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.491
You know, the test results.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.799
How come no one's told
me about this before?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.519
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

27:58.520 --> 28:01.879
Wow. You make me feel so special.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.731
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.599
Because you're sick and dead
men have nothing to lose.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.999
I have access to
many things, Ethan,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.328
but only you can give
me access to the Wolf.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.005
I need you to find him...

28:18.640 --> 28:20.039
and I need you to kill him.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.599
So I buy back my life
by killing for you?

28:23.600 --> 28:25.799
When did you become
so self-righteous?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.759
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure that
we're talking about the same thing here.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.847
You know, killing.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.479
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.250
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.999
Well, I got a fish
to fry and I'm late.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.646
I can get you in home in
time for dinner, Ethan.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.365
Question is...

28:52.160 --> 28:54.442
do you want your bike back?

29:04.280 --> 29:07.199
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

29:07.200 --> 29:09.050
Meaning a silencer would...

29:10.280 --> 29:12.050
be handy.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.559
So, how many guys are
we talking about?

29:15.560 --> 29:16.841
One.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.159
Knock 'em dead.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.284
Yeah, well, that's
the point, isn't it?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.803
<i>Allo?</i>

30:25.200 --> 30:26.640
Grenade!

31:04.560 --> 31:06.285
Pretty good for a jobber.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.559
You said there'd be
one guy, not five.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.159
Oops.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.879
But I did say keep the young
man with the mustache alive.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.679
What do you think
this guy looks like?

31:20.240 --> 31:21.999
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.479
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

31:24.480 --> 31:27.319
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.966
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.331
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

31:37.240 --> 31:38.719
Now this...

31:40.880 --> 31:43.239
is a young man with a mustache.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.599
No, that's a goatee.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.167
That's a mustache and some stubble.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.799
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

31:51.800 --> 31:54.519
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

31:54.520 --> 31:55.839
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.279
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

31:57.280 --> 31:58.959
What, from your century, grandpa?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.519
Look at that, that's a mustache.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.559
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

32:02.560 --> 32:04.159
- Hmm?
- Oh, my...

32:04.160 --> 32:06.039
Who are all these other guys here?

32:06.040 --> 32:08.319
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

32:08.320 --> 32:10.719
Nope.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.959
Because I usually like to know the
person I'm killing needs to be dead.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.560
And that's why you never made
it to the top shelf, my friend.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.839
Goatee, you're up.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.239
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

32:22.240 --> 32:24.568
I don't know, I swear.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.959
Kill him.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.359
Hold on, I can get
this guy to talk.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.841
He didn't know.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.088
Goddamn it.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.999
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.799
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.959
I wanna leave my daughter more
than just my shit pension.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.959
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.599
Half a dozen?

32:59.600 --> 33:01.599
I'm already halfway there.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.167
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.399
Don't take this the wrong way,
Viv, but you're not my type.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.731
I'm everybody's type.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.319
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.444
But I am sure that if you don't try
it, you'll be dead in two months.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.359
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

33:30.360 --> 33:34.281
And you're giving me credit for
those three guys upstairs.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.599
And I'm also gonna want a...

33:38.600 --> 33:42.359
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.679
Take it or leave it.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.564
I'll take it.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.130
I like the package.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.206
All right, now do it.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.126
Breathe, Ethan.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.168
It will hit you morphine-quick.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.846
One way or another...

34:18.480 --> 34:20.409
I will make you feel better.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.202
Don't forget to soak the fish.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.839
You promised me my bike.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.121
Zooey!

35:16.000 --> 35:20.046
- Zooey! Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.451
Look at this.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.644
This looks terrible.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.359
I think your... Your hair?

35:36.360 --> 35:40.319
No, no. Yes. Yes, my hair.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.079
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.479
It looks, uh, awesome.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.839
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.559
You think this can go to prom?

35:49.560 --> 35:51.679
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.319
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...

35:54.320 --> 35:56.399
All these times, now's
the time to say a joke?

35:56.400 --> 35:58.090
No, I mean, maybe...

35:58.760 --> 36:02.279
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

36:02.280 --> 36:04.639
No, you can... You could wash it...

36:04.640 --> 36:08.359
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

36:08.360 --> 36:11.799
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.879
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.959
Why don't we pick up some dinner?

36:19.440 --> 36:23.645
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner if
you're going to be three hours late.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.119
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

36:28.120 --> 36:31.529
Save it. I was crazy to
think I could count on you.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.999
I was gonna ask you to look after
Zooey while I go to London for work.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.239
Then, go.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.319
Really, you should
go, I can handle it.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.319
You can't handle dinner. How are
you gonna handle a teenager?

36:42.320 --> 36:47.208
How about I just diffused a
major meltdown. Her hair, OK?

36:49.360 --> 36:51.799
I have to take the first
flight out tomorrow morning.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.286
I'm calling a sitter.

36:55.760 --> 36:59.089
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.079
- What?
- There's, um...

37:02.080 --> 37:04.599
There's a specialist
here in Paris who has

37:04.600 --> 37:07.531
a experimental drug she's
willing to test on me.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.520
Experimental.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.199
What exactly does that mean?

37:15.200 --> 37:19.325
It means I might be able to spend a
little more time with you and Zooey.

37:19.960 --> 37:23.960
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.199
Can we just, like, maybe
quit fighting for a second.

37:31.200 --> 37:35.479
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

37:35.480 --> 37:39.639
I could grill us up
some of this tuna.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.399
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.728
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

37:44.280 --> 37:45.561
No way!

37:50.640 --> 37:52.439
You're gonna fix that door, right?

37:52.440 --> 37:54.688
Oh. Um...

37:55.400 --> 37:58.199
Yeah, that was a mistake.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.402
You haven't been here 24 hours.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.609
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.563
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.688
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

38:18.320 --> 38:20.409
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.281
You're terrible.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.599
<i>I knew you would call.</i>

39:01.600 --> 39:03.199
What the hell did you give me?

39:03.200 --> 39:05.999
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.443
My head... My head's dizzy.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.759
Vivi.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.921
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.999
I'm hallucinating.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.919
<i>- Take a shot of vodka.</i>
- What?

39:23.920 --> 39:26.600
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.526
Is everything OK?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.086
Yeah.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.282
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.719
Listen, you can call
me anytime you want.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.399
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.679
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.479
- I love you.
- All right.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.839
I'll be back in a couple
of days, I'm running late.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.039
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.679
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

40:46.680 --> 40:48.639
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.241
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.879
Look at me. Come on.

40:58.880 --> 41:02.289
Just one time up here. One time.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.041
Atta girl.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.241
Zooey!

41:15.760 --> 41:17.119
Oh.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.479
What?

41:18.480 --> 41:20.639
Wow, it's...

41:20.640 --> 41:22.559
- It's what?
- Geez.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.366
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

41:25.640 --> 41:28.319
It's so red.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.090
Vivi?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.079
Are you going to get that?

41:33.080 --> 41:36.039
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.319
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

41:38.320 --> 41:42.319
We talk a lot because we
sell internationally.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.799
It's always daytime somewhere.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.039
All right, so now we've
got three days to kill.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.279
What are you doing?

41:49.280 --> 41:50.999
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.679
I'm giving you mine.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.769
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.528
There. Welcome to this century.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.887
Zooey. Zooey.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.284
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.919
You think Hugh's gonna
like my hair color?

42:14.920 --> 42:16.519
Yes, I do.

42:16.520 --> 42:17.879
- Really?
- Yes.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.879
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.759
So you don't love it?

42:22.760 --> 42:24.039
No.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.359
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.325
Zooey, I really love it.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.369
Awesome.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.359
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

42:50.360 --> 42:52.879
forty-eight-hour
window between kills.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.479
Well, you only have
three days left.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.199
I'm not getting into
your car, Vivi.

42:58.200 --> 43:03.239
Not until I get a second opinion on
that whatever it was you gave me.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.999
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.599
- Aw.
- The manual says,

43:08.600 --> 43:10.719
if you'd bothered to read it,

43:10.720 --> 43:13.079
you'd find out if I can't
keep my heart rate lower,

43:13.080 --> 43:15.119
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.079
So keep your heart rate low.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.851
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.360
Get in the car already.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.879
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant

43:34.880 --> 43:37.287
who cooks the books for
your old friend the Albino.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.519
How am I supposed
to locate this guy?

43:42.520 --> 43:46.199
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.131
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.559
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.559
All right.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.199
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

43:58.200 --> 43:59.799
Lose the bike.

43:59.800 --> 44:03.129
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

44:16.920 --> 44:21.079
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

44:21.080 --> 44:23.279
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

44:23.280 --> 44:24.641
An Albino told me.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.839
Did he also tell you that
we offer discreet luxury?

44:29.840 --> 44:34.959
He told me not to talk to the
hired help, to talk to the boss.

44:34.960 --> 44:38.079
We're not the help, OK? We are the
executive vice president of sales.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.089
Ooohh!

44:40.800 --> 44:42.445
You're a couple of turds.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.679
Listen, asshole...

44:52.680 --> 44:56.559
little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.559
And you will never meet
the boss. Understand?

44:58.560 --> 44:59.761
All right, I'm sorry.

45:00.000 --> 45:00.679
Yeah.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.119
I had a really weird
night, you know,

45:03.120 --> 45:05.399
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.839
I think maybe we got off on
the wrong foot. My fault.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.599
Yeah.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.370
Can we start again?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.639
Let's start again.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.159
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the Eiffel Tower from

45:18.160 --> 45:19.930
everywhere in this town.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.279
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

45:55.280 --> 45:58.519
without an invitation, Mr...?

45:58.520 --> 46:00.519
Why are names important right now?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.199
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.209
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

46:06.560 --> 46:08.599
You are sitting in my chair.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.239
I'm just waiting for you.

46:21.560 --> 46:24.239
The Albino sent you, huh? Bastard!

46:24.240 --> 46:26.920
I've always been loyal. Please...

46:30.360 --> 46:33.679
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

46:33.680 --> 46:37.639
Sit down. I also have a
pretty teenage daughter.

46:37.640 --> 46:40.839
Father to father, your girls ever

46:40.840 --> 46:43.719
lock themselves in
their room, you know?

46:43.720 --> 46:46.799
Cut their hair,
paint it red, you know?

46:46.800 --> 46:49.207
Put wigs on and shit like that?

46:50.160 --> 46:51.600
No. Never.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.559
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.039
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.526
Then who are you?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.248
Ethan. Come on.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.050
<i>♪ Soul searching</i>

47:18.240 --> 47:21.959
<i>♪ Ain't no finer groove</i>

47:21.960 --> 47:26.879
<i>♪ Soul searching</i>

47:26.880 --> 47:29.239
<i>♪ Gonna make you move</i>

47:29.240 --> 47:30.559
<i>♪ Well</i>

47:30.560 --> 47:33.199
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.839
I do not want to be disturbed.

47:35.840 --> 47:40.159
Yes. Rule #2: Do whatever you say.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.679
That's right, Rule #2.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.199
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.448
And you are a good guy?

47:52.680 --> 47:54.639
You are a professional, huh?

47:54.640 --> 47:57.079
Why have I never seen
you in Paris before?

47:57.080 --> 47:59.399
I've been away on business
for about five years.

47:59.400 --> 48:03.241
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

48:06.120 --> 48:10.041
Well, I was never good at
balancing work and family.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.439
You know, when I go home,

48:15.440 --> 48:19.804
this life, the killing, the
rest it all disappears.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.203
I made the wrong choice leaving.

48:26.200 --> 48:30.119
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.162
That's the key.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.799
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.999
So let's not miss
dinner tonight, hmm?

48:36.000 --> 48:41.604
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

48:43.240 --> 48:46.489
Please remind me, who is he again?

48:57.800 --> 49:00.679
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.882
I'd like to have a word
with Zooey's father.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.119
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

49:09.120 --> 49:11.359
Zooey's fine, but we need to meet.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.319
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

49:16.840 --> 49:17.999
I can be there right away.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.326
Well, do hurry.

49:23.400 --> 49:24.840
We're going to school.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.719
As I was saying to Zooey,

49:26.720 --> 49:29.239
study after study has shown that

49:29.240 --> 49:33.839
aggression is exacerbated by
violent images in popular culture.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.279
Well, Zooey's mother raised
her to be a pacifist.

49:36.280 --> 49:37.599
Hm.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.930
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.809
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

49:51.520 --> 49:54.919
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

49:54.920 --> 49:58.439
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

49:58.440 --> 50:00.404
they all call for
different responses.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.719
Mr. Renner,
it's extremely important

50:04.720 --> 50:07.559
that you send your
daughter a clear message

50:07.560 --> 50:11.399
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

50:11.400 --> 50:15.679
violence is not an
acceptable answer.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.166
Ru try.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.879
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.759
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

50:27.760 --> 50:29.610
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

50:31.240 --> 50:33.159
Ow, my thumb.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.319
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

50:35.320 --> 50:38.719
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

50:38.720 --> 50:42.322
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

50:46.480 --> 50:49.081
Oh, God.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.359
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.039
I told you this is my boss's car.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.599
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

51:00.600 --> 51:04.079
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.

51:05.800 --> 51:08.799
I like this, who are these guys?

51:08.800 --> 51:11.959
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!

51:13.480 --> 51:16.319
Why can't you just listen to
me and try to understand?

51:16.320 --> 51:18.363
OK, why don't you
tell me all about it?

51:19.960 --> 51:22.439
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

51:22.440 --> 51:25.959
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.

51:25.960 --> 51:28.919
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.999
Well, she won't do
that again, will she?

51:33.880 --> 51:38.165
Just a second, sweetie, sounds like
the spare's loose in the trunk.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.646
Hey!

51:42.400 --> 51:44.841
I'm trying to have a
conversation with my daughter.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.759
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

51:50.760 --> 51:54.159
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.

51:54.160 --> 51:58.399
Well, don't, because sometimes it's
the only way to stop a bad guy.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.279
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.323
I'm proud of you, you
stuck up for your friend.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.124
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.879
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

52:08.880 --> 52:12.209
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

52:14.600 --> 52:15.926
Jesus Christ!

52:19.160 --> 52:21.727
Let's see if we can jump
start your memory, Mitat.

52:30.560 --> 52:34.119
It's my daughter.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.919
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

52:36.920 --> 52:40.090
That's OK, honey. I'm sorry, too.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.479
Favorite place to hang
out after school?

52:45.560 --> 52:49.845
I'll wrap my sales meeting and
meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.331
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

52:55.880 --> 52:58.799
A girl like this will keep
you running in circles.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.083
You must draw the
line, not be so soft.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.569
You're right, Mitat.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.199
I have been way too soft.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.439
Now, where do I find the
Albino's accountant, hmm?

54:26.000 --> 54:27.319
Hi, Zooey.

54:27.320 --> 54:29.519
It's 3:40, Ethan. Where are you?

54:29.520 --> 54:31.759
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.639
Forget it, you're always
late. I'm leaving.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.119
No, no, no, I'm almost
there, honestly, Zooey.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.765
Give me...

54:38.800 --> 54:40.439
Give me five minutes.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.405
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.241
Wow.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.439
Kids.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.239
<i>Sorry I freaked out earlier.</i>

55:20.240 --> 55:24.719
<i>It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.</i>

55:24.720 --> 55:27.559
<i>This is really new for
both of us. I get it.</i>

55:27.560 --> 55:31.479
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?

55:31.480 --> 55:32.919
- I remember.
- Kind of?

55:32.920 --> 55:34.610
- Yeah.
- OK.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.925
Gosh, the bike.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.924
What's going on, Ethan?

56:06.280 --> 56:09.199
It's just some flu I picked up.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.359
Can't seem to shake it off.

56:11.360 --> 56:12.720
What if it's something worse?

56:13.760 --> 56:15.799
No, it's, uh...

56:15.800 --> 56:18.844
It's nothing worse.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.159
You remember when we'd drink hot
chocolate at the beach house?

56:23.160 --> 56:24.679
Sort of.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.719
It's the one place I
wouldn't mind calling home.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.120
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

56:30.680 --> 56:34.123
You know, I kept all our
home movies in a box.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.959
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

56:38.960 --> 56:42.369
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Good.

56:43.760 --> 56:47.119
Oh, shoot, I forgot. I have
to go to Karina's tonight.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.319
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

56:49.320 --> 56:52.999
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.999
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.719
No, it's OK. It's just...

56:58.720 --> 57:00.759
Don't I need to call
her parents first?

57:00.760 --> 57:02.839
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

57:02.840 --> 57:05.439
That's all her parents understand.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.159
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.

57:07.160 --> 57:10.091
I don't need to call your mom.

57:11.400 --> 57:13.762
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.524
See you later.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.519
<i>Hi, this is Christine, I'm not
here, so please leave a message.</i>

57:21.520 --> 57:23.370
Tina, it's me.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.359
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

57:28.360 --> 57:32.559
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

57:32.560 --> 57:38.369
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.799
<i>Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.</i>

59:57.800 --> 59:59.559
<i>But, uh, who is this friend?</i>

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.159
<i>Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.</i>

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.850
<i>Anyways, give me a call.</i>

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.284
Zooey!

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.884
<i>Non, non.</i>

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.489
Son of a bitch!

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.651
Is this your car?

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.159
<i>Pardon</i>... Is this your car?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.600
- Whoa.
- No.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.119
Hey! You know the rule.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.599
Never involve family.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.999
This isn't a business
meeting, Mitat, this is...

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.639
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.444
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.245
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.331
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.719
OK. Come, come with us.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.919
Thanks for that.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.479
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.999
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.959
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.279
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.039
But your girls might be
able to tell me where

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.528
a 16-year-old would go to
party on a school night.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.886
What does this "spider" mean?

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.519
They are good girls,
they do not party.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.210
What does this "spider" mean?

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.879
La Soiree House.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.199
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.728
I have a daughter in there.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.169
Zooey.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.887
<i>Oui.</i>

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.521
Zooey!

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.170
Stop, please, please.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.886
Stop, please.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.681
Ethan!

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.201
Ethan!

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.565
Ethan! Please!

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.003
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.081
I got you, honey.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.446
What are you doing here?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.324
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.288
God, this is so embarrassing. They'll
never let me in there again.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.199
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.599
Because I like being
with my friends.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.039
Your friends?

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.561
Do you even remember what happened?

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.725
In the bathroom?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.679
- Zooey!
- What?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.319
In the bathroom, do you
remember what happened?

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.126
Look, Karina and I aced
the practice test, OK?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.759
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.167
So we decided to go hang
out with some friends.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.679
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.399
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.365
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.799
You're putting this on
and we're going home.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.799
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.999
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.559
You're getting on this bike and I'm
gonna follow you every step of the way.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.879
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.399
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.439
Get on this bike.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.529
- Or what?
- Now!

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.207
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, OK?

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.365
What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.522
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.450
Goddamn it.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.959
This is the flattest spot, so
let's just try it right here.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.919
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.078
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.439
Right, you picked it 'cause
it had the big bow on it.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:44.719
No. I can explain the big
bow, I got it. Get on.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.879
There's too many people. Look,
can we go somewhere private?

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.764
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.685
But it's purple.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:57.118
It is purple. Get on.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.961
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.038
Wow, we did it. We're
halfway there. We're on it.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.919
Give yourself time to push here, OK?
It's right here then. All right?

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.238
Zooey, all right.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.850
- Whoa. OK?
- OK.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.919
- Good.
- Easy, please.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.078
OK, I have you. Now, just
kinda, you know how to pedal.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.442
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.529
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.166
<i>Why did you leave us, Ethan?</i>

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.885
<i>Why did you leave me and Mom?</i>

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.719
<i>Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...</i>

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.649
<i>What?</i>

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.444
There is no easy...

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.484
There's no good answer, honey.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:51.599
All right.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.559
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.919
<i>Do you have another family?</i>

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.079
- Is that what it is?
<i>- No.</i>

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.079
<i>Do you have another perfect
daughter somewhere?</i>

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.119
Did you see me and not want me?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.721
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.481
<i>Well, why did it take so
long for you to come back?</i>

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.839
Look!

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.599
<i>The longer I was gone...</i>

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.770
it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.162
OK, OK, all right.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.567
That's all. It's nothing
to do with you.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.439
<i>Would you still care about
me if I did horrible things?</i>

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.926
Yes, of course.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.559
Absolutely.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.159
I lie a lot. Like, all the
time about everything.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.799
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.879
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.399
That girl I hit at school, she
wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.479
She was hitting on Hugh.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.679
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.006
Hugh!

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.479
These are so beautiful, thank you!

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.599
Give me one sec,
I'll be right back.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.007
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.599
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.199
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.239
I'm an athlete. I'm a striker.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.602
Last game I scored two
goals, by the way.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.327
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.559
No! Well, I... I... I
mean on the field.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.439
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.159
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.919
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.203
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.445
Real football.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.801
OK.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.999
Nice bike.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.959
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.491
You're the only one.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.159
I won't be home late, Ethan.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.679
- Where are you two going?
- School.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.879
Great, well, I'm headed
that direction myself.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.359
No, you're not.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.599
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.839
Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.520
OK, see you later, Mr. Zooey.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.839
I don't like being called that.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.319
You don't like Hugh?

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.239
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.959
It's my business to read people.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.399
You know, a lot of my friends'
dads are in sales, Ethan,

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.119
and not one of them
dresses like you.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.319
What are you saying?

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.603
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.843
Hey, I love you!

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.045
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.279
The accountant checked out. I need
you to tell me where he is now.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.479
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.919
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.559
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.759
Is it my fault if your
daughter is out of control

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.519
and affecting your
work and judgment?

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.919
You're right, Mitat. It
is affecting my judgment.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.319
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.599
Hey, my wife works late. I need
to pick up my girls at 4:30.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.087
I can't promise, but
I'll make an effort.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.161
Open up.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.769
I can't get around your mirror.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.929
Fine, asshole.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.841
Yes!

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.402
Ethan! Ethan!

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.559
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.841
Yeah.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.319
Do not open! The lock has
an explosive trigger.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.399
I got the codes to the briefcase. Give
me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.399
But after I give it to
you, you will kill me.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.839
No, but I swear to God I'm
gonna really torture you

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.839
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.639
- OK, one...
- Oh, no.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.919
- ...two
- No.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.691
No.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.879
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.119
I was thinking about tonight.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.041
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.319
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.568
Just the two of you, like a...

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.399
- ...romantic dinner?
<i>- Something like that.</i>

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.199
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.039
<i>but I don't know what I
need besides tomatoes.</i>

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.720
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.691
Just a sec, sweetie.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.090
Guido, are you a real Italian?

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.359
What?

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.879
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.039
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.242
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.399
Sauce?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.519
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.559
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.599
- You just said you're a real Italian, right?
<i>- Si.</i>

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.119
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.961
Ah! Spaghetti sauce! Red or white?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.079
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.159
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.479
OK, I know what to tell her.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.839
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.119
His mama has a great recipe.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.119
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.324
Why don't you say
hello to my daughter.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.279
Hello. I am Guido.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.919
Hi, Guido, this will
only take a second.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.119
No, no!

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.159
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.639
No, no, no.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.359
So, this is my mama's
favorite reduction sauce.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.679
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.919
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.199
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.399
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.959
and now I am the only one
left to take care of her.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.926
What else, Guido?

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.519
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.199
Then you peel the tomatoes.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.639
After ten minutes, no more,

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.959
add capers and parsley.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.159
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.442
and a teaspoon of sugar.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.199
Boy, that Guido's a
real mama's boy, huh?

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.439
I think it's sweet that he loves
his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.531
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- OK.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.919
No, wait!

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.439
Oh, please call her back.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.929
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.005
You know how to tell time?

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.681
Where's the one?

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.961
Where's the three?

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.199
That's two hours.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.719
You cut this guy
loose in two hours.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.199
Guido, remind me where you're
going after this kid lets you go.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.404
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.289
You're late.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.569
I'm in the middle of
a training session.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.001
Yeah, I... I can see that.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.885
Job's done.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.559
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.171
Sit down.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.130
Or did you forget why you came?

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.490
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.279
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.479
Who doesn't love Paris?

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.439
Now that we've
bankrupted the Albino,

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:18.559
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.599
leading us straight to the Wolf.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.370
When?

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.205
Very soon.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.165
You can't go dressed like that.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.799
What's wrong with how I dress?

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.731
What are you, <i>cheri</i>, 42 long?

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.279
Yes.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.642
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.449
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.719
- What's going on?
- Baby.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.126
Baby?

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.562
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.359
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.639
My God.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.649
This is not the first
time for you, after all.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.319
Actually, it is.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.965
What about your daughter?

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.039
I wasn't there.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.531
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.090
You were doing good?

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.211
I don't even remember.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.479
The baby is coming!

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.011
It is a girl.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.719
Before the baby leaves the
house for the first time,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.403
it is our custom to have the
family offer a blessing.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.839
- Leave?
- Yes.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.559
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.279
What word? I mean, I just
I brought Chinese, OK?

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.479
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.127
It's OK. Everything
is as it should be.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.879
Look, I didn't mean for you to have to
leave right after the child was born.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.731
I mean, there's plenty
of room for everyone.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.759
Maybe it's too much room.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.799
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.879
Just us and the children.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.759
It is good as long
as we are together.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.009
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.679
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.879
It's the name of a great man who
didn't shoot us when he could.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.999
And instead gave us his home.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.089
She has chosen carefully.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.370
The name is perfect.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.759
Hey, how did it go?

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.439
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.719
Good.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.888
So dinner was a success.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.607
Wow. You look nice.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.160
Did you wear that for me today?

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.559
Uh... no. I had to...

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.119
I had to give a speech.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.279
Are you coming to the
pre-party tomorrow?

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.159
Well, I am if you're asking.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.359
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.279
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.322
Yeah.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.481
Don't forget you've got Steelers
blood running through your veins.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.844
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.079
So?

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.759
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.519
So?

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.202
So I don't know how to
dance like that, Ethan.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.279
- No.
- Come on.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.847
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.279
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.767
Now, stand on my feet.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.759
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.559
OK.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.525
There and back.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.999
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.966
Now get off.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.647
Would you wear this
suit tomorrow for me?

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.362
Of course I would.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.811
Mom.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.089
Sweetie.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.719
<i>You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.</i>

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.839
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.159
<i>Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?</i>

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.159
She had that stuffed rabbit.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.646
Lamby the lamb.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.447
Right, Lamby the lamb.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.399
<i>I remember the day she never
took him to school again.</i>

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.799
<i>My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.</i>

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.799
<i>- Like you lost something.
- Yeah.</i>

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.482
- Have you told her yet?
- No.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.321
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.199
Just tell her you love her.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.439
She knows.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.079
She needs to hear it from you.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.365
Of course I love her. I mean,
I love her the same way...

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.050
the same way I love you.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.279
Good morning.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.720
Oh, God.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.239
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.044
Good morning, parents.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.839
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.319
Bring that orange juice right here.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.239
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. OK?

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.559
Come on, I squeezed the
oranges all by myself.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.807
Now, please.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.639
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.479
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to school.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.119
Come on, let's go. Go.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.719
Love you, Mom.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.410
I love you, sweetie.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.679
What's wrong with her seeing us?

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.928
Really.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.691
What happens when you're gone?

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.519
Yeah?

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.882
<i>The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.</i>

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.481
All right.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.244
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.479
- Hello.
<i>- You spotted me.</i>

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.639
- I'd have to be blind not to.
<i>- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.</i>

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.679
Your girls are expecting
you home tonight.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.042
<i>So is your beautiful wife.</i>

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.924
Who were you talking to?

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.127
Come on, accelerate!

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.521
Come on!

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.840
Come on, faster!

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.000
Have we lost him?

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.328
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.964
Why you don't kill me already?

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.209
Because you're the
father who knows best.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.046
Just kill him!

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.401
Vivi...

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.405
Welcome back.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.522
You let the Wolf slip
through your hands again.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.047
Where am I?

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.365
A safe place.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.679
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.519
I was actually pretty curious
myself. And as it turns out,

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.769
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:12.279
It's my wife. Hello?

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.359
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.721
Um...

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.399
I'm leaving the
doctor's office now.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.039
<i>Hurry up and get home. We're
gonna be late for Zooey's party.</i>

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.730
OK.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.599
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life killing for you, Vivi.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.609
You're almost there, Ethan.

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:35.881
Kill the Wolf.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.639
I'm gonna need a new suit.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.084
You heard him.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.919
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.599
Take me to my partner's house.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.962
He will help me to
get out of Paris.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.759
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.849
No!

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.679
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.361
Whoa!

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.599
Just smile and have fun.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.239
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.563
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.079
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.279
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.527
Yeah, of course.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.806
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.359
these are my parents.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.519
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.199
You're welcome.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.239
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.442
Hi. And this is my partner.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.410
Pleasure to meet you.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.486
And you.

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.851
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.481
How do you do?

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.484
Enchanté.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.639
Wow.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.039
Yeah, wow.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.641
Kids.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.445
Wow.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.684
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.319
Isn't this great?

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.760
Yeah.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.170
Zooey, do me a favor.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.527
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.801
Cheers.

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.685
You're working again!

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.564
Yeah. There's a problem here.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.399
That's why you came back to Paris?

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.879
No. I came back to
see you and Zooey.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.639
It was all a lie.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.119
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.319
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.727
Right now I don't have
the time to explain.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.206
How many guys do we have?

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.759
The police will be
here in ten minutes.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.999
- You all right?
- No.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.170
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.011
If we go now, there is enough time.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.204
OK. This party's over.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.639
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.719
I'll get my funds,
bring everyone in.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.888
Make sure the street's blocked.

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.488
At least have the
decency to look at me.

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.921
Kill him.

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.799
It's just bad luck.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.521
You're sick, Ethan.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.679
Wow, this is unbelievable.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.928
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.405
I'm gonna be sick.

01:45:58.200 --> 01:45:59.970
Come with me.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.090
Did you scratch yourself?

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.799
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.200
Just leave it to someone else.

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.122
Just please stay here.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.639
- Zooey!
- What?

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.966
Get down!

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.250
You hear me in there?

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.085
I'm sending you down.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.605
Oh, shit.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.441
Wheel's turning.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.759
No, stay, you fuckers!

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.883
Don't!

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.889
I gotta...

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.484
Don't.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.084
I wouldn't mind killing you.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.002
You scared a lot of
people up there.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.848
This is my daughter's party.

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.611
Yes.

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.687
Yes, come on.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.406
Viv.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.009
Oh, my God.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.479
Am I in hell?

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.639
So that's what it looks
like to you, Ethan.

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.003
Figures.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.605
- Finish it.
- What?

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.559
You'll do what I tell you to.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.969
- No.
- Finish it.

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.690
I passed my quota, Vivi.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.839
Ethan...

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.089
Jesus Christ!

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.486
<i>Are you really done
working for them?</i>

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.679
<i>A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.</i>

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.639
<i>I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.</i>

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.559
Kill him.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.119
<i>I should've left a long time ago.</i>

01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:56.399
<i>- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.</i>

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.126
Do it.

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.879
<i>What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?</i>

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.651
<i>The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.</i>

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.961
<i>- Ethan.
- Ethan!</i>

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.599
Do it!

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.520
<i>Promise you'll never
lie to me again.</i>

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.641
You have no choice.

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.643
I don't think so.

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.047
The wife wants me to give it up.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.759
<i>Can I talk to her?</i>

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.719
<i>No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.</i>

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.279
<i>- What?
- Yeah, we're...</i>

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.119
<i>We're taking a break from
each other right now.</i>

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:18.319
<i>At least she's not
throwing them at me.</i>

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.559
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:24.839
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.079
She said things, I've said things.

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.639
<i>There's been some tears,</i>

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.922
<i>but the week overall's
been really worth it.</i>

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.441
Hey.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.079
These are some presents
from me and, um...

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.399
a package that was
dropped at the house.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.490
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:23.204
I love you, Tina.

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:27.529
Just not enough to quit.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.962
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:40.159
If I could say one word to
you to change your mind,

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.359
would you give me that chance?

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.005
This isn't a game.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.959
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:50.119
that's not what I'm asking.

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.799
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.639
I'll hear the music,
and then I'll know.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.490
And if I never hear it...

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:01.122
I've already gotten
more than I deserve.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:08.926
I just wanna hang out as long as I
can with my daughter and my wife.

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.799
- What's the word?
- What?

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.479
What's the one word to
make me change my mind?

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:19.765
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.319
That's two, Ethan.

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.759
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.200
I'm so glad you came!

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.205
Come on, let's go inside.

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.049
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.041
Come on.

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:04.651
Is Dad a badass?

01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.486
Well, he's, um... He's
done some things.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.399
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.125
As long as he can, sweetheart.

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.250
He loves you so much.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.241
