00:02.000 --> 00:04.680
The UK's under attack by a
suspected foreign power.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.280
Do you know what the government's
response is? Neither do I.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.160
Gregory Knox? DS Flynn, Homicide.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.520
I need you to follow me,
quickly and quietly.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.320
Get in.

00:14.320 --> 00:19.760
The cameras on Flynn's ward were
isolated, on a secure network,

00:19.760 --> 00:22.320
controlled from the
seventh floor of CTC.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.920
Operation Vanguard is compromised.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.080
Thanks to us, a core
member of Napier's team was

00:28.080 --> 00:30.400
given a full, unrestricted pass.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.960
Louie, Rachel.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.360
Whoever's behind this is watching
everything we do.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.320
Who do we know with that
much access?

00:36.320 --> 00:39.600
I'm advocating the use of racial
profiling wherever it keeps us safe.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.640
Minister, we have to...
Now I'm finished.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.240
Like everything else we've
discussed, Khadija, you keep this

00:44.240 --> 00:47.480
under wraps.  Until you can give me
everything, the deep fake scandal.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.760
Mr Turner, why won't you respond to
the love child

00:49.760 --> 00:52.800
allegations made by Victoria Bello?
In case you haven't noticed,

00:52.800 --> 00:57.080
Isaac, you've just lost your job,
in government! It's over!  No!

00:57.080 --> 01:00.040
Welcome to the nightmare that is
correction, Isaac.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.080
This programme contains
strong language

01:16.760 --> 01:22.240
OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS
IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

01:30.000 --> 01:31.960
Look, Abigail, this is a bad time.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.760
Well, I can't choose when Mum
and Dad go on a city break.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.440
I've got tons I need to talk
to you about.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.120
I'm starting a podcast.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.400
Maybe you can tell me about
it tomorrow.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.160
Don't worry, I'll sleep, now you're
here.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.680
It's been like this since
the burglary. Which is weird

01:45.680 --> 01:48.360
because that happened in the daytime
when I wasn't even home.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.960
What burglary?
I thought Dad would've told you.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.440
You were burgled months ago
and nobody told me?

01:55.440 --> 01:59.160
I'm a police detective! INDISTINCT

03:06.840 --> 03:08.240
SHE SIGHS

03:14.600 --> 03:17.200
ABIGAIL MOANS QUIETLY

03:28.600 --> 03:30.160
The boiler's on a timer.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.480
If you want a shower, you've got
five minutes.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.760
Where are we going?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.080
Not far.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.600
That's why you said to come down?
So you could tell me not

04:09.600 --> 04:11.960
to walk around the flat naked?
Exactly.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.040
Does the idea of my naked body
offend you, Rachel?

04:15.040 --> 04:18.600
It...
It's not the most private of flats.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.440
What does that mean?

04:21.440 --> 04:23.320
The neighbours? Can they see in?

04:24.320 --> 04:25.920
Something like that.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.040
What, are they perverts? Why don't
you just go and arrest them?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.200
I'm working on it.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.280
Look, it's just a suspicion, OK?

04:36.280 --> 04:38.840
But it's a pretty strong suspicion,

04:38.840 --> 04:41.600
so just definitely don't walk
around naked.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.120
Yeah, I get it. Jesus.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.640
Why didn't you just tell me all
this upstairs?

04:46.640 --> 04:49.080
Because they listen, too.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.720
If it's all the same to you,
Rachel...

04:53.720 --> 04:56.560
..I don't think I'm going to stay
much longer.  Actually,

04:56.560 --> 05:00.480
I sort of need you to stay
for as long as you said you would.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.520
If you change the plan, they might
assume it's because I've told you.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.280
And?  And, I don't want them to know
that I know that they're watching.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.680
And what?

05:09.680 --> 05:12.480
I'm supposed to hang out in
the flat while they spy on me?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.720
You'd be surprised how quickly you
get used to it.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.440
You are fucking weird.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.120
WATER SPLASHES

05:32.720 --> 05:34.160
HE EXHALES

05:34.160 --> 05:35.440
Dad?!

05:37.040 --> 05:39.320
There's more, look.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.080
11, 12,

05:42.080 --> 05:43.920
13, 14,

05:43.920 --> 05:45.840
15,

05:45.840 --> 05:50.160
16...  Isaac!  ..17, 18...

05:50.160 --> 05:52.800
REPORTERS CHATTER

05:53.920 --> 05:57.400
TV:  The recently dismissed Minister
for Security, Isaac Turner,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.000
is yet to respond to
requests for comment.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.760
Ms Bello claims
the affair happened four years ago,

06:02.760 --> 06:05.120
while the MP was visiting
Nigeria.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.080
Now she and her three-year-old son
are applying

06:08.080 --> 06:11.520
for British citizenship amid
questions of political assistance

06:11.520 --> 06:13.240
and interference.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.280
I told McKenzie to shut this down.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.120
You knew about it?!

06:17.120 --> 06:18.840
I-I knew it was circling.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.360
REPORTER:  Did Zac Turner use his
power at the Home Office

06:21.360 --> 06:23.440
to block this young
woman's application?

06:23.440 --> 06:24.640
Why didn't you tell me?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.920
There's nothing to tell.
It's a baseless smear.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.320
You two, upstairs.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.800
And stay away from the TV.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.480
She's got an iPhone, Isaac.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.120
Hello?  Have you seen it?

06:38.120 --> 06:40.600
Of course you've seen it.
Look, I need you to find

06:40.600 --> 06:43.200
the paperwork before anyone else
gets their claws into it.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.320
We need a full timeline
of Bello's application

06:45.320 --> 06:47.760
to show there was no interference
from our department.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.560
I've moved to Policy, Isaac. I don't
work...  I know you don't work

06:50.560 --> 06:52.040
for me any more, I'm not an idiot.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.320
I-I just guessed you might be
interested in helping me,

06:54.320 --> 06:55.760
seeing as this implicates you too.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.560
You know I'd want to help you.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.960
But?

06:58.960 --> 07:02.160
You're a bit...toxic right now.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.480
So you're still checking my numbers?

07:06.080 --> 07:07.640
Why did you say those things?

07:11.800 --> 07:14.480
Look, I'm working on something,
but when I'm done,

07:14.480 --> 07:15.840
it won't be me who's toxic.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.400
I'll do what I can.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.400
I am not one of your fawning staff,
I am not Aliza,

07:25.400 --> 07:28.960
I am your wife. What is going on?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.560
Will you stay?

07:55.560 --> 07:56.800
Fine.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.360
But I want us to spend
the evening together.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.960
What did you have in mind?

08:03.960 --> 08:06.440
Talk? You know, be sisters?

08:07.640 --> 08:10.040
And I want to tell you about
my podcast.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.640
Tonight. Sounds good.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.040
Can I help you?

08:33.040 --> 08:35.560
I tried calling you, ma'am.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.600
DSU Garland instructed me to run

08:37.600 --> 08:40.000
the homicide reports in
your absence.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.840
And...?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.840
I just wondered if you had any
guidance for me?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.040
I'm on compassionate leave.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.600
Yes, DSU Garland mentioned that.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.040
I just...

09:01.040 --> 09:03.080
..didn't want to tread on your toes

09:03.080 --> 09:04.600
without checking.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.760
What's the status on Vanguard?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.880
No change.
The camera networks?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.480
Assumed compromised.
Tech's working on a solution.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.240
Update me when they have one.
Meanwhile, cross-check ballistics

09:16.240 --> 09:18.000
and forensics from
the hospital against

09:18.000 --> 09:20.720
the attacks on Edison Yao
and Joseph Mwangi.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.400
Yes, ma'am.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.720
WHISPERS: That should keep you busy.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.480
Is it even safe to talk?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.000
For now.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.680
We've swept the hardware,
found no devices.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.040
Assuming the compromise came via
the network,

09:48.040 --> 09:50.840
it's neutralised, it's offline.
But...?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.040
Well, we can open the beach,

09:52.040 --> 09:53.960
but it's not safe to go back in
the water.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.200
Soon as the ops room's back online,
it's at risk.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.560
Where the fuck are we supposed
to go if they can hack us here?

09:59.560 --> 10:02.080
Look, it's maybe not be my place
to ask,

10:02.080 --> 10:06.880
Guv, but are we doing enough
to rule out internal compromise?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.800
Anyone in particular you're
concerned about?

10:10.800 --> 10:13.200
No-one in particular.
I just don't want to move the op,

10:13.200 --> 10:15.400
only to find out
the problem's moved with us.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.800
You're right, Tom.
It's not your place.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.880
Understood.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.680
MOWER BUZZES What are you doing?!

10:32.680 --> 10:35.600
I don't know what kind
of microphones they have out there.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.160
I don't even know if
the house is safe.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.200
Fuck sake! Our police protection?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.680
For all we know it was them that
bugged the place.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.680
Did you have eyes on the whole time?

10:46.680 --> 10:49.160
Eyes on?
Why would they want to bug us?

10:49.160 --> 10:51.880
It's the kind of thing I can't get
into, Simmy. Security things.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.480
I'm not talking about security things. SHE SWITCHES OFF MOWER

10:54.480 --> 10:56.400
I'm asking about the woman on
the news

10:56.400 --> 10:57.800
who said she had your child.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.200
Yeah. Victoria.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.560
She's a care worker.
She looked after Mum, at the end.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.880
So, you know her?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.000
We met at the funeral.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.560
SHE SCOFFS And now what?

11:11.560 --> 11:14.200
She's just cooked this up to try
and get into the country?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.760
It's bigger than that. HE TURNS MOWER BACK ON

11:16.760 --> 11:19.480
Somebody else is behind it.
At first I thought it was China,

11:19.480 --> 11:22.640
trying to smear me in the run-up to
the facial rec contract.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.280
And now?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.520
Now... MOWER STOPS

11:28.640 --> 11:31.560
Who turned that off?
Who turned it off?!

11:32.640 --> 11:33.880
Isaac, enough!

11:38.760 --> 11:40.240
You tripped the switch.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.880
Look, I'm sorry

11:54.880 --> 11:56.920
for all the "need to know" crap.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.880
I just need you to trust me.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.600
What's all this?

12:16.200 --> 12:19.360
TV:  On behalf of Ms Bello, we have
written to Mr Turner this morning,

12:19.360 --> 12:22.520
requesting a sample of his DNA
for paternity testing.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.280
If Mr Turner fails to provide
a sample within seven days,

12:25.280 --> 12:27.520
then we will begin
court proceedings.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.080
Ms Bello claims
the affair happened four years ago,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.600
while the MP was visiting Nigeria.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.920
Now she and her three-year-old
son...

12:34.920 --> 12:38.040
No, no, this isn't about China.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.840
It's not about facial rec.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.960
This is about me.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.680
Someone's trying to destroy me.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.480
TV:  Isaac Turner has found himself
at the centre of an

12:52.480 --> 12:56.360
immigration scandal.
The question still remains...

12:56.360 --> 12:57.480
This ring any bells?

12:57.480 --> 13:00.120
I thought you said you could shut
this story down.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.840
I stopped the BBC from breaking it.
It's not on the BBC!

13:02.840 --> 13:05.520
It's all different channels
these days, McKenzie!

13:09.600 --> 13:12.880
Had such high hopes for him,
you know.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.200
From the person who sacked him?
I didn't have much of a choice.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.720
It's hardly going to help his
chances of bouncing back.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.760
Sir? Commander Hart to see you.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.560
And more shit, hot off the shovel.
Home Secretary.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.080
Danny. Seen this?

13:27.080 --> 13:30.520
It's your daily briefing on
Vanguard, sir.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.880
Go on, McKenzie. Fuck off.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.680
Following last night's attack,

13:35.680 --> 13:38.320
the operation remains
profoundly compromised.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.240
Comms and camera networks
are not secure.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.560
Technical staff are working
round the clock

13:43.560 --> 13:45.480
to safeguard the op,
but until then...

13:45.480 --> 13:48.080
It's 1956. Who's doing this?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.040
Our focus is widening.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.520
Suspects besides China are
being explored.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.400
I thought as much. Just typical.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.240
I'm sorry?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.920
It may have been possible.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.280
Who knows what Beijing
is thinking?

14:01.280 --> 14:03.640
It just didn't sound right to me.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.480
You've lost me, Home Secretary.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.920
China didn't
need to strong-arm us into

14:07.920 --> 14:11.600
the facial rec contract.
They had it in the bag.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.280
But why commission Turner's report
if your mind was already made up?

14:15.280 --> 14:18.920
The public need to see a
process, Danny.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.920
All voices aired.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.200
And Turner's concerns are valid.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.280
China poses a security risk.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.320
Yes. We know.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.760
Then you should also know

14:29.760 --> 14:33.280
that the risk posed by going
with China is the same as

14:33.280 --> 14:35.760
the risk posed by not going
with China.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.720
If they feel like hacking us,
that is in their gift.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.240
So, who would you go with?

14:43.240 --> 14:44.840
After China, who else is there?

15:00.440 --> 15:04.000
Everything the Home Secretary says
backs up Rachel Carey's theory.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.240
China's going to lose
the facial rec bid,

15:06.240 --> 15:07.880
the US are waiting in line.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.080
You still don't trust her?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.520
The jury is very much out on that.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.400
Did she seem stable to you?

15:20.400 --> 15:24.440
You mean, after she found
DS Flynn murdered?  Hmm.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.800
What's Frank got to say
for himself?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.160
So far, he's proving elusive.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.240
We need a clean shot
and secure comms.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.480
If Frank's not to blame, he can
bloody well help.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.960
Doorstep him if you have to.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.800
Remind him the special relationship
is meant to be reciprocal.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.040
What was that?

16:03.760 --> 16:05.840
Take it back. Take it back.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.560
I'm afraid I can't take it back.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.160
We are midway through
a procedure.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.440
You saw that lump, didn't you?
You have to remember,

16:11.440 --> 16:14.640
these tests are
a precaution while we await

16:14.640 --> 16:17.280
the reports from your biopsy and CT.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.040
If the results are still unclear we
will move on to capsule endoscopy.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.600
I had one of those, didn't I?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.800
No. With capsule endoscopy,

16:26.800 --> 16:30.160
you'll swallow a small pill
containing a wireless camera,

16:30.160 --> 16:32.960
which passes through
the small intestine,

16:32.960 --> 16:36.760
taking and transmitting many
hundreds of video images

16:36.760 --> 16:38.360
for analysis. HE CHUCKLES

16:38.360 --> 16:42.760
It's remarkable the things that can
be done with a camera nowadays.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.600
Is that so?

17:00.880 --> 17:01.920
PHONE CHIMES

17:07.760 --> 17:11.440
INTERNAL RINGTONE

17:15.560 --> 17:17.840
INDISTINCT VOICEMAIL GREETING

17:20.120 --> 17:22.600
First Rowan's not answering
my calls, now Rhys.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.920
I stop being a minister for what,
ten minutes, I'm a pariah?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.680
If I was still at the Home Office,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.240
I'd have the PR war machine gunning
for these pricks.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.280
Well, you're not at the
Home Office.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.360
You're at home.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.560
Can I make a suggestion?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.600
Just agree to the paternity test.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.160
Don't you see?
There won't be a paternity test.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.760
Because they'll fake it,
like they fake everything else.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.480
Hello?

17:50.480 --> 17:52.640
Does your property have
rear access?

17:55.760 --> 18:00.800
Thanks so much for coming in,
chez Turner. Sorry for the...

18:00.800 --> 18:03.320
SHE SCOFFS

18:06.600 --> 18:11.200
Simone, this is Detective Carey.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.880
Rachel.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.240
Do you mind if I...?
Yes, yes.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.160
QUIET ELECTRONIC CHIRPING

18:29.320 --> 18:31.840
I thought you didn't trust
the police.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.080
Yes.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.200
I mean, I trust her.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.880
All clear?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.640
From now on,

18:41.640 --> 18:44.320
if you want to contact me,
I'd like you to use this.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.600
Would you mind if I had a word
with the minister in private?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.960
Former...minister.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.800
Keep up.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.880
Yeah, it's him.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.400
How confident are you?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
I'm confident.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.520
Those are the guys I saw getting
into the grey van.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.960
HE CHUCKLES

19:19.960 --> 19:21.760
Can you ID him?

19:21.760 --> 19:24.600
With that mask,
facial rec won't be easy.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.280
That's if I can even find someone
I trust enough to run

19:27.280 --> 19:29.480
the search. If I give this to SO15,

19:29.480 --> 19:31.320
they'll want to know where it
came from.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.600
You can hardly say you were wearing
a hidden camera.  Well...

19:36.120 --> 19:38.000
Uh, well...

19:39.000 --> 19:42.040
..I got the Home Secretary to admit

19:42.040 --> 19:45.200
the government is complicit
in Correction.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.400
Khadija's tie camera? You did it?

19:47.400 --> 19:50.400
Being honest, I've no idea how I
managed to record anything over

19:50.400 --> 19:52.120
the thumping of my heart!

19:52.120 --> 19:54.800
I kept thinking he'd suss
me any second.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.320
Does that give us enough
to take to Khadija?

19:58.320 --> 20:01.120
Against Correction?  Mm.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.440
I've barely got my foot in the door.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.440
I need to witness
the UK Correction programme from

20:07.440 --> 20:09.960
the inside.
I need to record enough evidence

20:09.960 --> 20:12.760
to prove what they're capable of,
beyond doubt.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.920
And I need to do it all without
getting caught.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.640
So, what are you thinking,
potentially?

20:17.640 --> 20:18.960
Months?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.440
I don't know.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.000
Years?  I don't know.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.720
The people involved in this...

20:28.600 --> 20:31.600
..they'll stop at nothing
to keep it secret.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.640
You've seen the latest?

20:36.440 --> 20:38.520
The Lagos thing?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.720
Well, I wasn't sure if that was...

20:41.720 --> 20:43.920
What, you thought it was real?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.720
You're a politician.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.280
I'm not that kind of politician.
I wasn't judging.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.680
It's all part of it.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.200
You said yourself,

20:56.200 --> 21:00.240
this isn't China trying
to take our facial rec.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.720
Someone wants to destroy me.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.760
You must have made some
powerful enemies.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.760
I'm trying to catch
the man who killed my friend.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.400
If we can get to him,
maybe he can fill in the blanks.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.240
I think I know someone
who can help.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.280
I don't appreciate your minion
tailing me to

21:25.280 --> 21:29.360
a private appointment, much less
reporting it.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.480
I hope you know what you're doing,
taking her under your wing.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.920
On behalf of the Service, I
apologise for DCI Carey's behaviour.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.120
As regards your privacy, I'm...
Stomach.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.840
They think...
Jesus...

21:49.840 --> 21:52.080
..Frank.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.480
Got me waiting by the phone like
a lovesick 12-year-old.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.320
Who's your doctor?
Stanley fucking Kubrick.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.680
Shoved a camera up my ass,
down my throat.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.760
Now he wants me
to swallow one whole,

22:02.760 --> 22:05.680
like my stomach hasn't been through
enough fireball spinning all

22:05.680 --> 22:08.360
night long.  I'm sorry.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.640
What about the embassy?
Are they looking after you?

22:10.640 --> 22:14.800
I haven't told them. You're sick,
they look at you differently,

22:14.800 --> 22:18.560
like you're some sort
of fucking nonentity.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.000
I kept mine to myself.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.720
You had cancer?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.800
Told work I was glamping in
the Hebrides.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.480
In fact, I was having my thyroid
gland removed at

22:33.480 --> 22:35.360
the Royal Marsden.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.800
I was lucky, relatively.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.440
Wow.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.280
It never came back?

22:42.280 --> 22:43.840
No chemo?

22:45.200 --> 22:48.120
Complete remission for seven years.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
Mazel tov. HE KNOCKS ON TABLE

22:53.560 --> 22:55.400
What do you put that down to?

22:57.400 --> 23:00.280
Sorry, I didn't ask you here
to swap health stories.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.840
And now I can't even ask
you what I need to.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.320
Because I'm sick?

23:07.320 --> 23:08.960
Didn't you just hear what I said?

23:15.520 --> 23:18.320
The BBC's suffered a second hack.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.240
This time direct on the Newsnight
studio.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.040
The hardware sabotaged.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.880
Still haven't heard a question.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.120
We ran checks on everybody who had
access to

23:29.120 --> 23:30.880
the equipment...

23:30.880 --> 23:32.880
..with one exception.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.760
You think it's the kid I sent, huh?

23:34.760 --> 23:37.440
You think Louie sabotaged your
news programme?

23:37.440 --> 23:39.080
I mean, Jesus Christ,

23:39.080 --> 23:41.880
I was trying to do you
a fucking favour.  I had to ask.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.320
Whoever's behind this has the
capacity to compromise

23:44.320 --> 23:46.960
Operation Vanguard entirely.
Beijing.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.320
Our suspicions are shifting away
from China.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
Ah, where are they shifting to?

23:51.320 --> 23:53.000
I could share that...

23:53.000 --> 23:54.600
..if you were prepared to help.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
HE CHUCKLES

23:56.600 --> 24:00.640
You accuse me of sabotage,
and now you want my help?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.240
If the accusation's false,
you should have no reason not to.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.920
Mm-mm-mm.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.160
The seventh floor is down.
Vanguard needs a new home.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.040
And I'm the little piggy who built
his house out of brick.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.280
Can you let us in?

24:20.680 --> 24:22.520
I'll consider it.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.000
Can you consider it soon?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.600
Our officers are being killed.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.040
Yeah, sorry about that.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.200
Flynn.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.200
Fucking shame.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.480
Faith.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.840
What's that?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.480
What I put my recovery down to.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.280
HE SCOFFS Fuck off.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.720
Well, I was hardly devout.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.800
I quit Sunday School after they told
me I'd sinned

24:52.800 --> 24:55.280
for kissing Sarah Crawley in
the Bible cupboard.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.760
SHE LAUGHS

24:58.760 --> 25:02.400
But, yeah, it helped.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.800
Revisiting my religion.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.280
Prayer, confession...repentance.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.600
Obviously,
we're not from the same faith.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.480
We carry the same burdens.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.640
Guilt and regret.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.280
If you want to give yourself
the best chance,

25:27.280 --> 25:28.800
you'll free yourself of them.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.440
Who says I have any guilt
or regret?

25:35.800 --> 25:37.320
A lifetime in our trade?

25:38.640 --> 25:40.080
Come on, Frank.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.520
Don't tell me your stomach's the
only thing keeping you

25:43.520 --> 25:44.920
awake at night.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.280
Ooh.  Enjoy.  Thank you.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.920
I just came to grab a few things.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.640
I'm rushing straight out again.
Due at a conference. To tell

26:09.640 --> 26:13.040
you the truth, I'd rather avoid this
place altogether.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.920
Not easy when half your clients are
in the same building.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.320
I can see how busy you are.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.920
Oh, no, please.
They said there'd be follow-ups.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.680
Your colleagues came
to see me this morning.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.080
Has there been a
development in the case?

26:25.080 --> 26:28.840
Actually, Mr Knox,
I came to ask for your help.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.720
Help?

26:30.720 --> 26:33.120
I understand you have access to

26:33.120 --> 26:35.800
the Xanda Tech facial
recognition software.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.360
It-it-it was well within

26:37.360 --> 26:41.200
the CRC's remit
to assess Xanda's capabilities.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.040
Mr Knox, you're not in trouble.
May I show you something?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.960
I see.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.440
The mask.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.280
Turner said the Xanda programme
can unmask?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.720
Is this him?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.840
The man who tried to kill me?

27:16.840 --> 27:20.120
The detective who saved your life,
Patrick Flynn...

27:22.040 --> 27:23.560
..he died.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.360
You help me,
I can bring his killers to justice.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.800
I'll do what I can.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.280
INDISTINCT CHATTER

27:43.360 --> 27:45.400
It's getting busy out there.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.520
Really, I should start canvassing.
Either that

27:48.520 --> 27:51.920
or borrow an air rifle from one of
the neighbours.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.720
Is there anything else
you want tell me...

27:58.720 --> 28:00.440
..about Lagos?

28:00.440 --> 28:02.560
No, I don't think so.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.920
I mean...I don't even remember that.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.200
Wait, is that supposed
to be my hand?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.960
Which? The one holding the
glass of wine,

28:24.960 --> 28:26.920
or the one holding her waist?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.600
Simmy, this-this is faked.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.320
SHE SCOFFS Fake photo.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.040
That's what you're going with.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.960
Obviously not completely fake.
But, I mean, that's not my hand.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.160
Not your hand? Whose hand is it?

28:37.160 --> 28:39.080
Yeah, you know what I mean.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.920
You look like you were enjoying
yourself at the funeral.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.360
Come on.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.760
I mean, that's not...

28:44.760 --> 28:47.600
Obviously, it wasn't all doom and
gloom.  No, I can see!

28:49.880 --> 28:52.160
Remind me why you didn't take me
with you.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.680
Why I didn't take you with...?

28:53.680 --> 28:56.160
You're the one who chose not
to come. Do you not remember?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.840
Harry was starting nursery.
You were starting back at work.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.440
You didn't complain, going alone.
Well, it's not exactly like

29:01.440 --> 29:03.880
the two of you saw eye-to-eye.
Who sees eye-to-eye with their

29:03.880 --> 29:05.200
mother-in-law? You still go.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.360
Well, maybe you should have been
there, then.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.600
Dad?

29:17.520 --> 29:20.640
Who took this?  Isaac. Isaac!

29:26.920 --> 29:29.360
Ruby, pack a bag,
we're going to Nanny's.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.000
Oi! Oi!

29:38.000 --> 29:41.080
How much did they pay you for it?!

29:41.080 --> 29:42.600
Pricks!

29:46.040 --> 29:47.840
Who lives in that house?

29:47.840 --> 29:50.760
The one over there with
the green shed.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.680
Oh, uh, Rubes?

29:52.680 --> 29:55.320
I've told her to pack
a change of clothes.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.640
Why?

29:56.640 --> 29:57.920
I'm taking them to Mum's.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.920
Oh, come on,
please, you don't need to do that.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.080
Simmy, surely you can see this is
all fake.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.240
Ruby, and a toothbrush!

30:05.240 --> 30:07.800
I need to work.
The kids need to get out the house.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.240
Simm, I didn't put my hand on
her waist.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.840
It looked pretty convincing.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.960
Trust me. You have no idea.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.040
Simone, think about it.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.240
If you leave now,
how's it going to look?

30:21.720 --> 30:24.560
You're worried how it's going to
look?  A bit, it makes it look like

30:24.560 --> 30:27.600
this love-child nonsense is getting
to us.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.920
It is. A bit!

30:29.920 --> 30:32.560
OK, at least let me walk you to
the car.

30:34.360 --> 30:39.360
REPORTERS AND ONLOOKERS CLAMOUR

31:03.720 --> 31:06.480
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
I beg your pardon, Mr Turner?

31:06.480 --> 31:09.200
I said I hope you're proud, forcing
my family away from their home.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.560
Will you agree to
a paternity test, Mr Turner?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.200
Ha-ha! You'd like that, wouldn't
you?

31:13.200 --> 31:15.800
We'd like you to take our questions,
Mr Turner.  You know what?

31:15.800 --> 31:18.280
I would take your questions if
I could trust you

31:18.280 --> 31:20.640
to report my answers.
But you're not here for the facts,

31:20.640 --> 31:23.120
are you?
You're here to stir the pot.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.600
You're here to turn this nothing of
a story into a scandal.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.720
No wonder mainstream media's time
is up. You know what? You're right.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.520
Get your phones out.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.760
If you're not part of
the mainstream media,

31:33.760 --> 31:36.080
get your phones out
and hit the red button,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.680
because you cannot trust this lot
to tell the truth.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.520
It's not even their fault.
Most of them, all of them,

31:41.520 --> 31:44.920
they don't have any idea how fake
their own news is.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.760
They're just doing their jobs,
chasing stories that don't exist,

31:47.760 --> 31:50.520
ruining lives without
taking responsibility.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.440
How many times have we
seen families hounded by

31:53.440 --> 31:56.800
the media like this?
Then the truth comes out

31:56.800 --> 31:59.400
and they all move on,
and do they apologise?

31:59.400 --> 32:02.320
No, of course not. You know what?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.640
I've got news for them.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.600
The truth IS coming.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.080
And when it comes,
you'll know about it, believe me.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.440
It's going to blow this bullshit
right out of the water.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.040
Until then, my advice...?

32:14.160 --> 32:16.840
Don't believe a single word they
tell you. Excuse me.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.960
WHOOPING AND YELLING

32:39.160 --> 32:42.680
Thank you for coming straight away,
Mr Napier.

32:42.680 --> 32:46.960
As we can see from your CT,
there is significant lesser curve

32:46.960 --> 32:50.600
gastric wall thickening
with extensive regional adenopathy.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.400
There appears to be extensive
lesions within

32:53.400 --> 32:55.120
the right lobe of the liver,

32:55.120 --> 32:57.640
and above the diaphragm there are

32:57.640 --> 32:59.920
multiple sub-centimetre bilateral

32:59.920 --> 33:02.800
pulmonary lesions...
Doc.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.400
I've had a burning in the pit of
my stomach for the past four months.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.200
Whatever you've got to tell me,

33:08.200 --> 33:12.120
I've already imagined it
and worse. So, please,

33:12.120 --> 33:15.800
in English, what am I looking at?

33:15.800 --> 33:17.680
Stage four stomach cancer.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.840
Once we've received the results of
your biopsy,

33:23.840 --> 33:25.680
we can make a diagnosis...

33:27.960 --> 33:30.240
Mr Napier,

33:30.240 --> 33:33.720
patients often find it useful to
include a friend or a family member

33:33.720 --> 33:36.520
in this part of the process.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.960
Someone to ask questions,
take information on board.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.480
Do you have somebody
who could do that?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.720
TV:  Isaac Turner lashed out at the
press on his doorstep this morning,

33:51.720 --> 33:54.080
in a tirade against
the British media.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.000
You seen it?  ...families hounded
by the media like this!

33:57.000 --> 33:59.560
And do they apologise?
No, of course not.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.840
You know what?

34:00.840 --> 34:03.040
I've got some news for them.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.800
The truth IS coming...

34:05.800 --> 34:08.560
God, he sounds like
a religious nut.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.760
LAUGHTER Jesus wept.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.120
..and when it comes, believe me,

34:12.120 --> 34:14.440
it's going to blow this bullshit
right out of the water.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.760
Until then, my advice?

34:15.760 --> 34:18.240
Don't believe a single word they
tell you.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.720
His erratic behaviour is
the latest in

34:20.720 --> 34:22.600
a long line of scandals...

34:26.120 --> 34:28.680
Do you think our esteemed
Home Secretary regrets allowing

34:28.680 --> 34:30.520
Isaac Turner quite so much insight?

34:33.040 --> 34:34.760
It's not like he actually said it.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.600
Are we going to wait until he does?

34:44.800 --> 34:46.560
That was not helpful.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.080
It seems to have got
the vultures off my drive, so...

34:49.080 --> 34:51.760
"The truth is coming"?
What was that, a teaser?

34:51.760 --> 34:54.320
"Don't believe a single word"
seems to be trending higher.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.080
I've told you what they're
capable of.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.240
You want to scream from
the rooftops?

34:58.240 --> 35:00.880
You will get your chance.
But until I tell you otherwise,

35:00.880 --> 35:03.240
just...whatever they say,

35:03.240 --> 35:05.720
just keep your head down
and go along with it.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.280
What about Knox?

35:11.280 --> 35:13.440
Did he agree to help?

35:13.440 --> 35:15.120
After some persuading.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.480
I'm toxic, right?

35:17.880 --> 35:20.160
Maybe this test will buy you
some favour.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.120
Test?

35:24.120 --> 35:25.840
Yeah. I saw your tweet.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.600
"#TheRealZacTurner.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.480
"Looking forward to paternity test
results. Nothing to hide."

35:34.480 --> 35:36.640
What the...?

35:36.640 --> 35:38.480
That's my study.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.280
I take it that's not you, then.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.720
Isaac?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.000
Isaac?

35:51.160 --> 35:53.240
CALL CUTS OFF

36:24.840 --> 36:26.400
Hello, everyone.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.200
I just wanted to respond,
directly and calmly,

36:30.200 --> 36:33.000
to the allegations you're
hearing about me,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.560
which I can assure you are entirely
without merit.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.840
I've nothing to hide,

36:38.840 --> 36:41.680
which is why I am co-operating
with the paternity test.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.440
In fact, I have agreed

36:45.440 --> 36:47.760
to appear first thing tomorrow
morning on BBC One,

36:47.760 --> 36:50.680
by which time, I'm told,
we can expect a result,

36:50.680 --> 36:52.080
to give my side of the story.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.200
So let's hope they listen.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.920
Looking forward
to seeing you all at breakfast.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.760
Once again, nothing to hide.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.160
Well, this is random.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.760
What were you expecting,
a bench by the Thames?

37:20.240 --> 37:23.640
It's a CCTV blind spot. I don't get
to choose where they are.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.280
You promised me an exclusive.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.920
If Isaac Turner has a meltdown
and blurts it out to anyone with

37:28.920 --> 37:31.840
a phone, that's not exclusive.
He won't.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.080
You sure about that? You're not just
the least bit concerned about where

37:35.080 --> 37:36.720
his head's at?

37:44.760 --> 37:47.800
RECORDING:  Welcome to the nightmare
that is Correction, Isaac.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.280
Is this Rowan Gill?

37:49.280 --> 37:52.360
Our enemies fake
things that we can't deny.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.800
He bugged the Home Secretary
with your hidden camera.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.480
His head is in the right place.

37:56.480 --> 38:00.280
Worst of all, if we do ever prove it
or deny it, we're fucked.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.240
Why?  You know why.
We're as guilty of it as they are!

38:05.360 --> 38:06.960
I'm going to need the file.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.600
Not yet.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.960
Khadija, you know the risks if we
move too soon.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.960
SHE SIGHS

38:15.960 --> 38:18.040
Well, make sure Turner stays
on point.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.400
We sat on that love child story
for him.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.720
He pays us back by
ranting against the media?

38:22.720 --> 38:24.240
He was just letting off steam.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.360
Well, two can play at that.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
You know, Rabbi...

39:04.640 --> 39:07.960
..you think about all the good
things that you did

39:07.960 --> 39:11.080
in your life and...

39:14.000 --> 39:15.960
And all the bad things?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.880
Everything I did...

39:22.880 --> 39:24.360
..everything...

39:25.680 --> 39:29.280
..was in the service of making
the world a safer place.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.080
I'm just not sure that...

39:38.880 --> 39:41.400
..everyone's going to
see it that way.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.400
So, this is why you've come back
to shul after 50 years?

39:49.040 --> 39:50.560
To atone for your sins.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.720
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.680
but you've come to the wrong place.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.600
No amount of prayers can save you
from your sins against your fellow

40:00.600 --> 40:02.000
human beings,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.680
and no rabbi can offer
you forgiveness.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.600
Your atonement is in your hands...

40:10.480 --> 40:12.000
..through your mitzvahs...

40:13.560 --> 40:16.000
..your good deeds in everyday life.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.040
INTERNAL RINGTONE

40:29.080 --> 40:31.720
My God, I've been trying
to call you all evening.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.480
I was putting the kids to bed.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.760
Besides, I know what you're
going to say.  Oh, yeah?

40:36.760 --> 40:39.200
That tweet wasn't real,
nothing's real.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.800
What about that rant on our
doorstep? Was that real?

40:43.800 --> 40:45.920
Uh, yeah.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.880
That was real.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.400
Listen, Simone...

40:50.400 --> 40:53.000
..tomorrow morning, on the TV...

40:54.000 --> 40:57.160
..they're going to make it seem
like I'm the father of that boy.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.680
Who hates you enough to do all this,
Isaac?

41:03.680 --> 41:06.560
I mean, apart from me right now.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.360
Why do you hesitate?

41:14.960 --> 41:19.000
Earlier, when I suggested you do the
paternity test, you hesitated.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.640
Did I?

41:23.640 --> 41:25.040
There it is again.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.120
I don't know, Simone.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.480
Maybe I am the father.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.280
He looks like you.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.920
What?

41:34.920 --> 41:37.000
Victoria Bello's son, Amandi.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.320
I've been looking at him.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.360
So, I mean, what, what are you

41:42.360 --> 41:45.240
trying to say exactly? We all look
the same?

41:45.240 --> 41:46.680
No, Isaac,

41:46.680 --> 41:48.280
I'm saying he looks like you.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.080
Just wait one second.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.760
Isaac, what is it?

41:58.760 --> 42:02.120
There's another fucking journalist.
Hold on, I'll call you back.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.680
It's 11 o'clock at night!

42:06.680 --> 42:09.480
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

42:09.480 --> 42:11.160
Look, I'm sorry for the tardiness.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.840
I'm here to pick up
a Mr Isaac Turner?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.480
For what?

42:15.480 --> 42:17.800
You're going to Media City?

42:17.800 --> 42:21.880
What, Manchester?  Uh, Salford.
I'm going to be on the telly, am I?

42:21.880 --> 42:24.760
Well, I believe so, sir, yeah.

42:24.760 --> 42:29.160
So, what, BBC Breakfast
are expecting me?

42:29.160 --> 42:32.280
You are...Isaac Turner?

42:42.280 --> 42:44.640
Make yourself comfortable in
the back, sir.

44:29.360 --> 44:32.520
Just one puff. It'll stop you
stressing all the time.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.480
I'll smoke that...

44:35.880 --> 44:38.160
..if you drink this, neat.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.960
Who says "neat"?

44:40.960 --> 44:43.400
It sounds like something Dad
would say.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.000
It means without a mixer, you idiot.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.280
Oh.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.840
Your turn.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.160
Oh, shit.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.560
TV:  ..firm but fair. So why, then,

45:01.560 --> 45:03.920
did the woman who claims
to have had a lovechild with

45:03.920 --> 45:07.480
the Security Minster
find her application languishing in

45:07.480 --> 45:11.320
the system five times longer
than average?

45:11.320 --> 45:13.600
Coincidence or interference?

45:13.600 --> 45:15.680
In an exclusive interview,

45:15.680 --> 45:18.520
we speak to Victoria Bello
from her home in Lagos.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.360
Oh, fuck.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.000
I was told over
and over by the Home Office

45:23.000 --> 45:25.480
that my application could not
be traced.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.880
Once, they even told me that
I must have been mistaken

45:27.880 --> 45:29.320
and I couldn't have applied,

45:29.320 --> 45:31.960
as if they were trying
to wear me down.

45:31.960 --> 45:35.000
Look, I don't want anything from
Mr Isaac Turner.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.760
But my son has the right to grow up
in the country of his father.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.680
Later I'll be speaking to the
Shadow Home Secretary,

45:41.680 --> 45:44.680
who is leading the calls for an
urgent inquiry into

45:44.680 --> 45:48.040
the mishandling of Bello's case
by the Home Office.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.880
You do?
Oh, Abby, I think you're right.

45:53.880 --> 45:57.360
I really do need to sleep.
It's been really fun.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.840
Wait, I still haven't
told you about my podcast.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.320
RACHEL SIGHS

46:01.320 --> 46:04.160
Go on, then,
tell me about your podcast.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.440
Don't diss it till you've heard it,
Judge Judy.  Mm-hm.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.120
You'd actually be really into it.

46:09.120 --> 46:13.280
It's a bit like Serial,
only it's called Free Shaun.

46:13.280 --> 46:17.240
Or I might go more esoteric like
The Bus Stop.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.760
What are you talking about?

46:19.760 --> 46:21.800
Free Shaun? As in Shaun Emery?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.320
Half the people think he killed
that woman,

46:25.320 --> 46:27.200
the other half didn't.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.880
But they don't know.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.600
I've met him.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.200
Abigail, Shaun Emery was guilty.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.800
What?

46:38.800 --> 46:41.880
He pleaded guilty at the hearing.
I should know. I was there.

46:41.880 --> 46:44.800
But you said...?
I was wrong.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.960
Look, I-I think it's great that
you're podcasting.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.640
I think it's really...neat.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.520
But I just think you should pick
a different story.

46:56.520 --> 46:59.400
I mean, that story's over.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.960
They've got you staying at
the Donlevy Hotel.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.680
Would you like to check in
or go straight to the studio?

47:28.800 --> 47:30.680
Yes, just go straight to the studio.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.040
Isaac?

48:08.480 --> 48:11.480
Mini... Oops,
nearly called you "Minister" then.

48:11.480 --> 48:14.040
Easily done. Thanks for coming in
so horribly early.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.360
After all the build-up,

48:15.360 --> 48:17.960
we just had to lead with
the lovechild.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.040
So, I'm really going on, then?

48:20.040 --> 48:22.600
Um, I certainly hope so!

48:22.600 --> 48:24.720
I suppose they'll just
hack into it live.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.000
I wonder what they'll make me say
this time.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.320
Do you, um,
need somewhere to change?

48:29.320 --> 48:30.440
No.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.520
Right, then.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.080
There's teas and coffees in
the green room.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.120
Are you a part of it?

48:38.120 --> 48:39.840
Part of...?

48:39.840 --> 48:43.240

PHONE BUZZES

48:45.560 --> 48:47.000
Just one second.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.520
Hello?  Isaac?

48:52.520 --> 48:54.160
Aliza?

48:54.160 --> 48:57.200
I thought your 6am calls
were a thing of the past.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.840
Only when it's good news, right?

48:58.840 --> 49:01.520
What, you can prove no-one's
interfered with the Bello case?

49:01.520 --> 49:03.600
No. I haven't even looked
into that.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.240
Right, well, Newsnight fucking have,
so what's the good news?

49:06.240 --> 49:09.200
You were right, of course.
I have been checking the numbers.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.280
You'd never know it from
the usual platforms.

49:11.280 --> 49:13.720
The hate for you there is growing,
if anything.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.880
But across all social and polling...

49:17.320 --> 49:18.560
..your numbers are up.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.480
I'm not talking about a spike,

49:22.480 --> 49:25.480
but if you analyse the timeline from
the racial profiling comments,

49:25.480 --> 49:28.160
the lovechild allegations,
the anti-media rant,

49:28.160 --> 49:31.000
your approval is on a slow
but steady uptick.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.360
Aliza, someone's trying
to destroy me.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.680
Destroy you?

49:36.680 --> 49:38.440
Tell your approval ratings that.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.280
Isaac?

49:43.280 --> 49:46.120
Mr Turner?
Would you like to follow me to set?

50:23.720 --> 50:26.640
Zac, just so you know, mate, it's
the headlines on the hour as usual,

50:26.640 --> 50:29.800
and then we're straight on to you.
London floor is live.

50:29.800 --> 50:32.280
Good Morning. The G7 summit,
due to take place...

50:32.280 --> 50:35.000
You're having quite a week.
Salford studio, 20 seconds.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.880
We were debating whether
to go with car crash,

50:36.880 --> 50:38.040
dumpster fire or shitshow.

50:38.040 --> 50:40.200
CHUCKLING

50:40.200 --> 50:42.880
Studio live in ten, nine...

50:42.880 --> 50:45.360
My mistake. Standing by.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.840
And some breaking news.

50:47.840 --> 50:52.520
Lawyers acting on behalf of Nigerian
care worker Victoria Bello say

50:52.520 --> 50:56.240
that a DNA test to determine whether
former Security Minister

50:56.240 --> 51:00.000
Isaac Turner is
the biological father of her child

51:00.000 --> 51:02.480
has produced a negative result.

51:05.480 --> 51:09.120
A surprising twist in
the continued saga of Isaac Turner.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.200
Lawyers working on behalf of

51:11.200 --> 51:14.560
the Bello family say they plan
to seek a second test.

51:14.560 --> 51:18.120
We'll be back with more updates
throughout the morning.

51:18.120 --> 51:21.080
Now, it's over to Lauren
and Will in our Manchester studio.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.120
Morning, all.  Good morning.

51:24.120 --> 51:26.240
Well, the saga continues.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.800
It certainly does here,

51:27.800 --> 51:31.240
because first up on
the sofa today is the man who is,

51:31.240 --> 51:33.040
or perhaps was,

51:33.040 --> 51:37.200
at the heart of the so-called
Lagos lovechild allegations,

51:37.200 --> 51:40.200
Isaac Turner. Welcome.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.920
Good Morning.

51:41.920 --> 51:45.080
Your paternity test has come back
negative. You must be delighted.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.760
No, I'm not delighted.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.200
I'm just... I'm glad this whole
silly sideshow is over.

51:50.200 --> 51:53.520
I never actually heard you deny
the claims.

51:53.520 --> 51:56.160
Well, you've seen the test results.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.560
I have. I heard you deny them.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.840
You uploaded a video, right,
saying you had nothing to hide?

52:03.680 --> 52:09.000
Yeah. I-I felt it was important
to reassure the public.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.560
Is that what you meant by
"The truth is coming?"

52:12.560 --> 52:14.120
You know, Lauren,

52:14.120 --> 52:17.360
my family and I have been
the target of some

52:17.360 --> 52:20.720
pretty nasty lies.
Those lies have now been exposed,

52:20.720 --> 52:23.560
so, hopefully, everyone can go back
to something like normal life.

52:23.560 --> 52:26.240
Why do you think she made
those claims?

52:26.240 --> 52:28.520
She must have known
the DNA test would fail.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.280
I understand the burning ambition

52:31.280 --> 52:34.160
people all over the world share
to come here to the UK.

52:34.160 --> 52:37.760
Unfortunately, it does mean that
some people will go to desperate

52:37.760 --> 52:40.320
lengths to jump the queue.

52:40.320 --> 52:43.800
And, as the government said in
its manifesto,

52:43.800 --> 52:47.200
our immigration system cannot be
fair if it's not firm.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.680
Mm. Well,
as you brought up

52:48.680 --> 52:49.960
manifesto promises,

52:49.960 --> 52:51.400
and as you're
no longer

52:51.400 --> 52:52.640
at the Home Office,

52:52.640 --> 52:54.520
has the government delivered on
that one?

52:54.520 --> 52:56.480
Well, I think the Prime Minister

52:56.480 --> 52:58.840
is laser-focused, rightly so...
PHONE BUZZES

52:58.840 --> 53:01.480
..on the most pressing
global issues.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.920

then, your old boss?

53:03.920 --> 53:06.520
ISAAC SCOFFS
You're putting words into my mouth.

53:09.880 --> 53:13.200
Hello.  Detective? I wasn't sure if
you'd be up. I'm....

53:13.200 --> 53:15.840
I'm not sleeping an awful lot
at the moment.

53:15.840 --> 53:18.920
It's hard to tell what's early
for other people.

53:18.920 --> 53:22.880
You did say to call as soon as
I had something.  Go on.

53:22.880 --> 53:26.480
I was sceptical about Xanda's
unmasking feature.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.800
Given we're dealing
with AI modelling,

53:28.800 --> 53:31.960
I took their claims of
100% face-match accuracy

53:31.960 --> 53:34.280
with a sizeable pinch of salt.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.320
But...?

53:36.320 --> 53:38.240
It's given us a face,

53:38.240 --> 53:40.840
and I've run the search function.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.120
And...?

53:43.680 --> 53:47.560
Well, naturally, the programme can't
access the criminal databases you're

53:47.560 --> 53:50.200
used to,
it can only find what's online.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.720
Mr Knox, do we have a match?

53:53.560 --> 53:55.200
Yes.

53:55.200 --> 53:58.280
Looks like it's from some
corporate security website.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.520
Nikolai Mirsky.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.640
And that's about it.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.720
His name and nationality.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.640
How do you know his nationality?
The web page it came from.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.520

54:20.360 --> 54:23.280

54:25.440 --> 54:27.160

54:34.000 --> 54:36.200
Car won't be a minute.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.520
Oh, Erm... That... How did it go?

54:39.520 --> 54:43.480
Great.  I mean, the result,

54:43.480 --> 54:46.920
it came back negative?
That's what happened?  Yeah.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.040
And that's what's going out,
the same...?

54:51.920 --> 54:53.720
They've booked you a late checkout.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.800

no code, just log straight on.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.880
All right.

55:23.880 --> 55:26.400
Oh. Uh, I'm so sorry. I don't...
