00:33.066 --> 00:34.328
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

00:34.401 --> 00:35.732
Whoo! Whoo!

00:35.802 --> 00:39.203
I think the swimming hole is
right around the corner!

00:39.272 --> 00:40.534
Yes! Whoo! Whoo!

00:40.607 --> 00:42.370
First one in
the water is

00:42.442 --> 00:43.739
...um, first one
in the water!

00:43.810 --> 00:45.107
No fair.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.440
I have to take
off my stuff.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.310
Aah!

00:58.258 --> 00:59.122
Whoo-hoo!

01:10.470 --> 01:12.563
Faster!
We're getting a swirl!

01:15.208 --> 01:16.140
You ready to get out?

01:16.209 --> 01:17.369
Yeah, dude.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.503
Let's get BMO
to make us some "Sassages,"

01:19.579 --> 01:21.171
maybe with
that one mustard.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.771
I'll use the
"Sassage" flare.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.650
Hopefully,
BMO sees that.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.019
Didn't lady tell you not
to use the "Sassage" flare.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.023
Yeah.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.787
Well,
don't abuse it, man.

01:33.860 --> 01:34.849
'Cause you're getting...

01:34.928 --> 01:36.156
I'm getting <i>what?</i>

01:36.229 --> 01:37.389
'Cause you're
getting fat.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.328
Nyang.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.457
Aah!

01:40.533 --> 01:41.727
Whoa.

01:41.801 --> 01:42.995
Nyang.
Nyang, Nyang!

01:43.069 --> 01:44.001
Ooh! Aah!

01:44.070 --> 01:45.037
Nyang! Nyang! Nyang!

01:45.105 --> 01:45.935
Hiya!

01:46.005 --> 01:46.835
Nyang.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.430
Hey. Relax.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.907
Grob, dude!

01:49.976 --> 01:51.136
Your hat's alive!

01:52.479 --> 01:54.879
This is crazy!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.279
Gah Nyang.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.340
He likes me!

01:58.418 --> 01:59.282
Nyang, Nyang, Nyang.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.182
Nyang... mm.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.277
It's not my hat.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.878
It's, like,
this other thing now.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.116
Yeah, man.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.488
Hat's can be anything...
pants, other people.

02:06.559 --> 02:07.617
It's fine.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.491
Yeah, but it's, like...

02:09.562 --> 02:10.789
living now.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.058
Yeah, it's a miracle.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.828
Now he can listen to our
rad jokes and hang out.

02:14.901 --> 02:15.833
Right.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.301
Maybe it's
good he's alive.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.897
You were a rad hat, and now
you're a rad... Little Dude.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.532
Nyang.

02:22.609 --> 02:23.633
Yo, bro!

02:23.710 --> 02:24.802
Our eyes are down here.

02:24.878 --> 02:25.742
Nyang!

02:25.812 --> 02:26.870
Come on, Little Dude!

02:26.946 --> 02:27.810
Let's go live life!

02:27.881 --> 02:28.711
Nyang.

02:29.682 --> 02:30.512
Yeah! Whoo!

02:30.583 --> 02:32.016
Whoo-hoo!

02:33.820 --> 02:35.219
Rah! Rah!

02:35.288 --> 02:37.483
Ooh-mwah! Rah!

02:37.557 --> 02:39.684
Ooh-aah!

02:45.732 --> 02:47.256
Aw, yeah! Aw, yeah!

02:47.333 --> 02:49.426
BMO, Jakey likes!

02:49.502 --> 02:50.833
Look at that spread!

02:50.904 --> 02:52.963
I did it up
big time for you.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.802
Hope you're hungry!

02:54.874 --> 02:56.569
Ha ha!
You know it!

02:56.643 --> 02:58.770
BMO,
this is Little Dude.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.675
Hello.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.771
Nyang?

03:01.848 --> 03:02.678
Nyang!

03:02.749 --> 03:04.444
Cribes!

03:04.517 --> 03:05.677
What?!

03:05.752 --> 03:07.117
Aah! There's hot
grease next to us!

03:07.187 --> 03:08.814
Don't fool around!

03:08.888 --> 03:09.718
Nyang! Nyang!

03:09.789 --> 03:11.279
Ooh! Ooh! Aah!

03:12.358 --> 03:13.689
Oh, no!
Get off of me!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.125
Little Dude, no!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.093
You don't jump on heads!

03:16.162 --> 03:17.686
That junk is rude,
Little Dude!

03:17.764 --> 03:18.628
You okay, BMO?

03:18.698 --> 03:19.790
I am fine, Finn.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.357
I just thought you
kept better company.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.299
Sorry, BMO.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.393
He's just excited.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.438
Nyang! Nyang! Nyang! Nyang!

03:26.506 --> 03:27.768
N-nyang-yang-yang!

03:27.840 --> 03:29.239
Nyang! N-n-nyang! N-n...

03:29.309 --> 03:30.139
Sorry, Little Dude.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.234
But I got to eat.

03:32.979 --> 03:33.911
Don't touch anything!

03:33.980 --> 03:35.470
I'm still frying
up garnish!

03:35.548 --> 03:36.537
Okay.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.208
Yeah. Okay.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.714
Your head looks weird
with short hair, man.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.316
It feels like a peach.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.756
Hey! Little Dude!

03:49.829 --> 03:52.457
Y'all can get in on this
if you promise to be good.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.702
Only good babies
Get "sassages."

03:58.905 --> 04:00.395
Nyang!

04:00.473 --> 04:02.270
Hey, don't eat the...

04:02.342 --> 04:03.934
the... the food?

04:05.845 --> 04:07.745
Dude, he turned
it into poo!

04:07.814 --> 04:09.839
This is <i>poo</i> now!
Smell it!

04:12.485 --> 04:13.577
Yep.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.416
Little Dude!

04:15.488 --> 04:19.288
Quit it!

04:19.358 --> 04:21.350
Gotcha!

04:21.427 --> 04:22.792
Oh, little deezy.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.352
What am I gonna
do with you?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.261
You guys should
get ready for bed.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.697
Yeah. Okay.

04:28.901 --> 04:29.731
Hmm!

04:29.802 --> 04:30.632
Ow!

04:30.703 --> 04:31.567
BMO hit you on the butt.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.914
N-Nyang. Nyang.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.040
Shh!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.948
Little Dude, you got to chill.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.146
Nyar. Nyar. Nyar.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.051
Night-night.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.282
Nyar-r-r-r-r.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.482
R-r-r-r-r-nyang!

04:51.557 --> 04:53.650
Nyang.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.784
Nyang?

04:56.596 --> 04:57.688
Nyuuuur.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.529
Jake! Wake up!

04:59.599 --> 05:00.725
Someone's on the house!

05:00.800 --> 05:03.064
It's probably
Ice King again, dude.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.694
Man, we should tell him
we know he sleeps

05:04.771 --> 05:06.261
on the top of
our house.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.305
Oh.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.313
No, no, no!

05:22.288 --> 05:23.312
No! Not on my head!

05:23.389 --> 05:25.084
Pooh buns!
Pooh buns on my head!

05:29.128 --> 05:30.390
Gross.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.360
Ninja.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.337
Eh?

05:41.374 --> 05:43.365
Oh, uh, nyah.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.378
Aah! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Ha.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.743
What are you doing
in our house, homey?

05:47.814 --> 05:49.076
Please, don't hurt me!

05:49.148 --> 05:50.877
You're in grave danger,
and it's all my fault!

05:50.950 --> 05:51.882
Wha?

05:51.951 --> 05:53.043
What are you talking about?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.984
Your hat accidentally
touched my head flower.

05:55.054 --> 05:55.884
See?

05:56.889 --> 06:00.222
My magic imbues anything it
touches with an evil spirit...

06:00.293 --> 06:02.853
One that craves
destruction and chaos!

06:02.929 --> 06:04.191
Yuck.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.726
I buried myself so that nothing
would touch my body ever again!

06:09.802 --> 06:11.997
But then this bloom
grew out of my head.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.402
C'est la vie.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.997
Evil magic donks,
homey.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.132
I'm sorry.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.336
That's just the
way my magic works.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.675
Papa always said
I was a bad wizard.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.078
Right, Papa?!

06:22.148 --> 06:23.740
"Baby's a bad wizard."

06:23.816 --> 06:25.215
"A bad wizard," huh?!

06:25.284 --> 06:26.512
You're a bad wizard!

06:26.586 --> 06:28.349
I'm a bad wizard!

06:28.421 --> 06:31.117
Whoa. Cool it, man.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.680
Let's just fix Little Dude.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.283
Uh, yeah.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.987
Okay.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.393
Guys!

06:37.463 --> 06:39.226
Your stanky friend
jumped out the window

06:39.298 --> 06:41.163
and ran toward the
Candy Kingdom!

06:49.208 --> 06:50.869
Oh, hello.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.410
Aren't you a cutie?

06:52.478 --> 06:55.072
Hey, are you lost,
tiny gentleman?

06:58.017 --> 06:58.847
Nyang.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.285
Nyang, Nyang.
Nyang, Nyang.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.422
Where is he?

07:09.495 --> 07:11.190
Little Dude?
Little Dude?!

07:11.264 --> 07:13.095
Nyang!

07:13.166 --> 07:13.996
Pbht!

07:14.066 --> 07:14.896
Nyang?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.529
Pbht!

07:18.604 --> 07:20.196
Nyang.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.672
Blisterin' beef!

07:26.379 --> 07:27.471
N-n-nyang.
N-n-n-yang-yang-yang.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.572
- No, Little Dude!
- Nyang?

07:29.649 --> 07:30.877
That's a <i>bad</i>
Little Dude!

07:30.950 --> 07:31.780
Nyang!

07:32.752 --> 07:33.844
Aah! The horsey!

07:34.854 --> 07:35.821
Na-na-yang-yang.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.985
Hiya! Little Dude!

07:39.058 --> 07:40.116
Nyang!

07:40.193 --> 07:41.490
You were supposed
to be my buddy!

07:44.464 --> 07:45.795
All my fault.
All my fault!

07:45.865 --> 07:46.991
You're a...

07:47.066 --> 07:48.294
N-n-n-n-nyang!

07:48.367 --> 07:49.561
Wha!

07:49.635 --> 07:50.693
Oh, gleeble snoots.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.101
How is he so <i>strong?</i>

07:52.171 --> 07:57.473
Whomever the hat possesses gains
the proportional strength of a hat.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.601
Look out!

07:58.678 --> 07:59.667
He's got the horse again!

08:03.416 --> 08:06.510
Evil presence detected.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.721
Sorry, fellas.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.625
I don't thrive in
conflict situations!

08:19.565 --> 08:20.759
Evil.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.198
Nyang?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.066
Nyang.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.095
Nyang.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.002
No!

08:27.073 --> 08:28.472
Not the Gumball Guardian!

08:28.541 --> 08:29.769
Evil.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.207
Nyang.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.143
Na-yang.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.982
Dude! Use your powers!
I can't!

08:38.049 --> 08:39.642
All I <i>can</i> do is think about my

08:39.719 --> 08:42.187
papa and how much
I disappoint him!

08:48.861 --> 08:50.089
Just think of
something positive!

08:50.162 --> 08:51.459
Something comforting!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.465
Like... my mommy?

08:54.901 --> 08:57.529
When I came home with bad grades
from Wizard School,

08:57.603 --> 09:00.367
my mommy used to
hug me and hug me.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.298
Oh, mommy!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.435
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

09:05.511 --> 09:06.808
Uh, yeah.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.143
Just think about your
mom and use your magic.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.149
Uh, okay, let's try this.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.685
I... love my mommy.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.781
Hugs. Aww. I'll hug you.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.688
I'll hug <i>you.</i> Hug me.

09:19.759 --> 09:22.694
Ooh! It worked!

09:22.762 --> 09:23.592
I love my mommy!

09:24.564 --> 09:25.394
I love my mommy!

09:26.365 --> 09:27.195
Hi, fellas.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.096
I love being alive.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.126
Mommy!

09:30.202 --> 09:31.931
I'm a window,
and I'll hug you!

09:32.004 --> 09:33.198
Mommy!

09:34.307 --> 09:35.239
Ha ha!

09:35.308 --> 09:36.832
I feel like
hugging everybody!

09:36.909 --> 09:38.001
Hi, mommy!

09:39.312 --> 09:41.280
♪ I'm going to hug you ♪

09:41.347 --> 09:42.575
Mommy.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.876
Ha! Somebody get this
guy some clothes.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.547
Now... Now rise up, love buddies,

09:49.622 --> 09:53.820
and hug your gross
brother into submission!

09:53.893 --> 09:55.451
Gonna squeeze the

10:02.234 --> 10:03.428
Hey, pal,
we're working together!

10:04.971 --> 10:05.903
Come on!

10:05.972 --> 10:07.200
Let's be Pal-jamsas.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.605
P-pal-jamas. Pajamas.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.165
Nyang! Nyang!

10:13.646 --> 10:15.614

10:16.616 --> 10:18.607
Thank you,
my newly conscious bros.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.811
Now return your
life-forces to me.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.046

- Yay!

10:22.121 --> 10:23.213
Not living!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.381
Nyang. Nyang!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.822

10:27.760 --> 10:28.988
Duh?

10:29.061 --> 10:29.891
Yes!

10:32.098 --> 10:33.793
Poor Little Dude.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.164
He was just doing it up
the only way he knew how.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.703
It's not his fault
he was created evil.

10:38.771 --> 10:39.635
Yeah.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.570
He deserves to
come back good.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.235
Wizard, mommy-magic

10:44.310 --> 10:45.208
Okay.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.244
Mommy.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.109

10:48.180 --> 10:49.704
Oh, my goodness!

What is this lovely place?

10:51.450 --> 10:53.213
Life, man!

10:53.285 --> 10:54.411

10:54.487 --> 10:56.352
And this dude
is your pops.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.753
No, I-I...

10:57.823 --> 11:00.383
Oh, I guess I am. Huh.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.721
Be good to this dude.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.321
I will... <i>way</i> better
than my papa was to me!

11:05.398 --> 11:06.797
Yep. That's the idea.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.925
Jake, looks like
I need a new hat.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.731
