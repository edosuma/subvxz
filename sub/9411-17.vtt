Let's see if he does
any better with the music.

14:16.610 --> 14:19.276
Hey! You could've taken
better care of my CD.

14:19.276 --> 14:23.343
Thanks a lot, Nick. Your stupid
gerbil is supposed to listen to my CD,

14:23.343 --> 14:26.543
- not eat it.
- Stanley didn't get anywhere near it.

14:26.543 --> 14:27.743
[ Cooing ]

14:30.110 --> 14:33.210
- It must've been Grace.
- She doesn't have teeth yet.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.910
Yes, she does.
She already bit me.

14:35.910 --> 14:38.210
I'm outta here, space cadet.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.143
- Let me know when the shuttle lands.
- Sam, wait! Listen!

14:42.476 --> 14:45.476
It's bad enough to let
your stupid rat eat my CD.

14:45.476 --> 14:46.976
But blaming it on the baby?
That's really lame.

14:47.676 --> 14:49.576
First of all, Stanley's a gerbil,
not a rat.

14:50.276 --> 14:52.710
And, second of all,
she's not my sister!

14:52.710 --> 14:56.676
- [ Clattering ]
- [ Groans ] Now what?

14:57.676 --> 14:59.676
Oh, no.

15:00.176 --> 15:02.176
Here we go again.

15:26.743 --> 15:29.743
Mom and Dad are gonna
think I did this.

15:34.143 --> 15:37.543
What the-- Grace!

15:44.043 --> 15:48.410
[ Crashing, Clattering ]

15:56.843 --> 15:59.843
I'm not taking the blame
for this, Grace!

16:04.843 --> 16:07.710
[ Feedback Squawks ]

16:11.843 --> 16:15.443
Come on out, Grace!
The fun's over!

16:22.943 --> 16:25.843
This has gone too far, Grace!

16:33.476 --> 16:35.610
- Grace!
- [ Footsteps ]

16:35.610 --> 16:38.610
[ Rattling ]

16:43.610 --> 16:45.376
I know you're in here, Grace,

16:45.876 --> 16:48.876
or whatever you call yourself.

16:48.876 --> 16:51.676
Better come out.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.676
Stanley?

16:57.676 --> 17:00.976
- [ Squealing ]
- Stanley, get back here.

17:01.476 --> 17:04.310
Oh, no.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.310
[ Squealing ]

17:07.810 --> 17:11.210
I know you're in here.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.242
- [ Growls ]
- You ate my gerbil.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.510
She ate my gerbil!

17:16.510 --> 17:18.876
[ Belches ]

17:19.410 --> 17:22.376
- [ Grace ] Whee!
- [ Groans ]

17:32.976 --> 17:35.976
You can't get away from me, Grace!

17:38.443 --> 17:42.210
Grace!

17:42.610 --> 17:45.076
Let me in there, Grace!
Let me in there!

17:45.076 --> 17:47.876
[ Grunts ]
Grace!

17:53.976 --> 17:57.810
- Grace, no!
- [ Laughs ]

18:04.943 --> 18:07.776
"Only me"?

18:11.610 --> 18:14.943
What a good girl.
So smart.

18:15.343 --> 18:17.810
- So strong.
- [ Belches ]

18:17.810 --> 18:20.343
[ Squealing ]

18:22.210 --> 18:25.343
- [ Crying ]
- [ Squealing ]

18:25.343 --> 18:28.476
[ Groaning ]

18:28.910 --> 18:31.843
- [ Grace Laughing ]
- [ Squealing ]

18:33.710 --> 18:37.176
- [ Crying ]
- Hold still, little monster.

18:38.910 --> 18:43.676
- [ Grace Crying ]
- This looks bad, doesn't it?

18:43.676 --> 18:45.743
[ Grace Crying ]

18:49.643 --> 18:52.210
Dr. Campbell said
it was all a terrible mistake.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.976
A computer error or something.

18:56.910 --> 19:00.276
- I told you she wasn't ours.
- You were right, son.

19:03.076 --> 19:07.210
- Sorry we doubted you.
- It's okay. So who's got our baby?

19:13.710 --> 19:17.210
Sounded like the doctor
called them from the hospital.

19:17.210 --> 19:20.976
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- That must be them now.

19:20.976 --> 19:23.943
[ Grace Cooing ]

19:27.776 --> 19:30.376
- Hello.
- Baby.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.776
Cool car.
Who's in the back?

19:39.210 --> 19:41.443
Parents.

19:41.443 --> 19:43.443
- Good-bye, Grace.
- [ Coos ]

19:43.443 --> 19:46.476
Bye, sweetie.

19:55.176 --> 19:59.243
[ Laughing ]

19:59.243 --> 20:01.876
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

20:01.876 --> 20:04.310
She looks just like my sister Chloe.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.376
She does.
Let's call her "Chloe."

20:06.376 --> 20:08.576
Ah! "Chloe" it is.

20:08.576 --> 20:11.443
- Welcome home, Chloe.
- Can I hold her?

20:11.443 --> 20:15.343
Sure. There you go.

20:18.443 --> 20:20.943
Yeah. He's got ya.

20:20.943 --> 20:23.576
- He's got ya.
- Who picked out your clothes?

20:23.576 --> 20:28.143
- Aw, look, darling. She looks just like me.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.876
- [ Kissing ]
- She has got your eyes.

20:32.943 --> 20:37.176
Hey, baby Chloe.
I'm your big brother Nicholas.

20:37.643 --> 20:39.976
Cut that baby talk
and give me some food.

20:39.976 --> 20:44.443
- None of that mushy junk.
