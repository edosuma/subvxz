WEBVTT

01:15.033 --> 01:19.662
Do you know how hard l've prayed?
Why does he make me suffer?

01:20.831 --> 01:24.542
-God will give you a child.
-Let me see her.

01:38.182 --> 01:42.351
-So you killed another one.
-'Cause you had nothing to do with this.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.771
Maybe you ought to stay off her
once in a while.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.606
Get out, you witch!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.573
I've got 85, and my boots are off.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.409
You don't have a sheath.

01:58.535 --> 02:03.915
l'll get one, but that'll be another quarter,
and this is all l have.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.753
Go wash yourself.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.638
You get me in trouble and l'm gonna
cut your dick off and boil it in hog fat.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.099
I'm gonna cut his dick off...

02:24.728 --> 02:27.939
l'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.817
What was that, sweetheart?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.236
l'm cold.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.245
Do you want to hold him?

02:42.871 --> 02:46.415
l'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

03:06.395 --> 03:11.816
-lt's midnight. What do you want?
-l told you God would give you a child.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.613
Whose is it?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.242
ls your husband home?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.915
God is giving you a child.

03:31.837 --> 03:36.465
His name is Dick, after a wish
his mother should've lived to see.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.718
Come on. Drink this.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.682
You know, there's no point
in both of us not sleeping.

04:30.145 --> 04:34.440
-She wakes up at night when l drop off.
-You so sure it's a girl?

04:35.067 --> 04:37.902
Well, believe me,
she knows what she wants.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.324
l packed your valise.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.162
-l could have done that.
-Well, you'll get a chance.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.039
The clasp is broken.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.377
Carla said she saw Sally hitting it
with a hammer.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.047
She's taken to your tools
like a little lesbian.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.066
Am l ever going to sleep again?

05:18.694 --> 05:20.903
At least you don't look tired.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.365
l just want everything to be perfect.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.285
l want her to come into our home
at its best.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.873
Close your eyes.

05:39.589 --> 05:43.884
-You're on a warm, sandy beach...
-Because l'm a whale.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.599
You're on a warm, sandy beach.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.855
You can smell the faint scent
of coconut oil.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.735
And as you slide your hands

06:01.778 --> 06:06.282
through that cold patch of sand
underneath the shadow of your deck chair...

06:06.366 --> 06:08.117
You're good at this.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.373
Lola?

06:24.760 --> 06:27.219
Lola. Hello?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.222
Yes, but on occasion,

06:30.307 --> 06:33.392
you have to resign yourself
to sleeping where you are.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.312
That's why they sell subway tokens, silly.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.315
Lola.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.653
-You're looking lovely today.
-Thank you. Are you here to see me?

06:45.280 --> 06:49.492
No, l'm just verifying some information.
Thank you, Lola.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.209
He just always stops by
concerning the strangest things.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.921
-Yesterday it was my engagement ring.
-Enough, Lola.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.757
You know there's something
about the way he talks.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.218
l could listen to him read the phonebook.

07:07.302 --> 07:11.430
Well, when he gets to "S,"
l need Howard Sullivan at Lever Brothers.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.270
Remarkable.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.317
l picked it for its sensuality,
but it also, in some way,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.278
reminds me of our business.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.742
Who is the man who imagined her ecstasy?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.578
Who indeed?

07:37.707 --> 07:42.545
-We were just talking about you.
-Burt's on his way. Where's Roger?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.715
Probably taking another Grecian treasure
out of its crate.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.219
l apologize for Baltimore. lt has to be done.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.721
lt's a sales call.
lsn't there more l can do here?

07:52.806 --> 07:56.267
lt's not a sales call.
You're the face of our business.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.728
They need someone they can trust.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.108
London Fog. How ludicrous.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.528
-Really? l have one.
-So do l.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.406
No, of course. lt's just the name.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.535
There is no fog in London.
There is no London fog.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.789
-Are you sure about that?
-Quite. Never was.

08:19.374 --> 08:23.919
lt was the coal dust from the industrial era.
Charles Dickens and whatnot.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.423
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson is here to see you.

08:30.552 --> 08:34.221
-Come on in, Burt.
-Hey, Don. Bert, Lane.

08:35.599 --> 08:39.643
-We need you to have a seat, Burt.
-Okay.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.858
You got a blindfold, too?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.071
This isn't easy.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.452
-lt really isn't.
-Oh, God.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.581
l really thought l'd made it.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.293
l know it's unkind,
but it's generous and it's fair.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.549
-Well, why the hell did you wait so long?
-lt was brought to our attention

09:10.634 --> 09:14.929
that your wife was undergoing radiation.
We thought it decent to wait.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.681
That was decent.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.518
Sorry l'm late. Did l miss anything?

09:25.148 --> 09:28.859
Sad meeting. Sorry about that.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.113
lt wasn't easy.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.492
-We'll see how you do without my Rolodex.
-We're going to take that risk.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.120
You make me sick. You're the dying empire.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.040
-We're the future.
-Burt, control yourself.

09:43.124 --> 09:48.462
-No, l'm the head of accounts, damn it!
-l'm sure we'll regret it. l'm serious.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.968
See you on the breadlines, fellas.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.016
ls that the last of it?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.935
Because l don't like how much
l'm getting used to these.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.604
l don't know anything you don't know.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.567
You understand there's no point ever
in making over $40,000

10:10.652 --> 10:13.737
when you'll be taxed 69%?
You're working for them.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.907
And God forbid you really make it.
Everything over 70 grand is 81 %.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.077
-Even if you're married?
-Fellow comrades in mediocrity,

10:20.161 --> 10:24.790
l want you to listen very carefully.
You can all go straight to hell.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.429
l heard he's going in-house at Nabisco.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.266
-You're sure it's not starting again?
-Mr. Campbell's office.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.642
-What?
-l'll let him know.

10:43.727 --> 10:47.229
-The firings.
-Mr. Campbell, Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.900
-l'm at lunch.
-l'll bring you a doggy bag.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.156
Holy crap.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.702
You couldn't have pulled me aside
to say that?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.203
l'm sure it's nothing.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.248
How the hell am l supposed
to live like this?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.210
Drop dead, you limey vulture!

11:12.797 --> 11:14.340
Son of a bitch!

11:16.634 --> 11:18.927
l assume you can continue
to handle this beautifully

11:19.012 --> 11:21.930
while l dispense psychotherapy
to the girls in the pool.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.600
You Americans don't know
how to handle your emotions.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.143
lt's unbecoming.

11:26.227 --> 11:30.314
His wife is sick. And if you had talked
to his girl, she would've informed him.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.192
So he would've had a longer walk
to Mr. Cooper's?

11:33.276 --> 11:34.693
And if you had talked to me,

11:34.778 --> 11:37.696
l would have been waiting
with his coat and his Rolodex.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.573
While we're on the topic of decorum,

11:39.657 --> 11:42.659
l'd like to speak with you
about the way l'm being addressed.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.370
Could you be more specific?

11:44.454 --> 11:48.207
The switchboard. l'm not John.
l'm Mr. Hooker.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.211
That's the way they've been taught
to address the secretaries.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.798
Yes, well, as l've explained,
in Great Britain...

11:55.882 --> 12:00.135
A truck is a lorry and an elevator is a lift.
l've got it, Mr. Hooker.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.430
Despite your title, you are not a secretary.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.310
-l'm Mr. Pryce's right arm. l'm not his typist.
-Of course.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.896
Good luck, everybody. Good luck!

12:11.648 --> 12:15.984
l assume you will let him know
when Mr. Peterson has left the building.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.412
-How are we today?
-Very well, thank you.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.667
-Burt Peterson's left the agency.
-Really?

12:32.335 --> 12:38.715
Yes. l can't speak for everyone here,
but l like you.

12:40.135 --> 12:44.304
-And l like you.
-But you don't know me.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.683
But l will make that effort,
if given the opportunity.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.976
Pardon?

12:50.520 --> 12:53.856
l apologize that l haven't been
more welcoming, socially.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.483
lt seemed until your wife arrives...

12:57.652 --> 13:00.863
l didn't want to make it awkward
with a threesome.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.948
Although, now that l think of it,
perhaps your being alone

13:03.032 --> 13:05.242
is all the more reason
l should've offered my hospitality.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.786
-Do have a seat.
-Why?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.706
ls something wrong?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.292
l don't know. You just removed
the head of my department,

13:13.376 --> 13:15.711
and now you're offering me a chair.

13:15.795 --> 13:20.591
How cruel of me. l wanted to inform you
that you're now head of accounts.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.722
-Excuse me?
-lt seemed like the right thing to do,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.391
despite your lack of hospitality.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.104
The specifics are pending,
as is the announcement.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.650
ls this really happening?
l need to know it's certain.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.695
Yes, but...

13:47.118 --> 13:50.496
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-Splendid.

14:00.048 --> 14:04.593
-Well, it turns out things are splendid.
-That's good.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.429
Could you get my wife on the phone?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.908
I have Mrs. Campbell for you.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.539
-How are you, sweetheart?
-What are you doing?

14:33.790 --> 14:36.833
l know l told you this morning.
l'm having luncheon,

14:36.918 --> 14:39.002
with the Docents' committee from the Met.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.713
-How are they?
-Since when do you care?

14:41.965 --> 14:44.925
Since l was made head of accounts.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.635
-No!
-Yes.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.472
Oh, my goodness! Peter, that's wonderful!

14:50.932 --> 14:54.351
lt really is.
l knew it would happen one day for real.

14:54.852 --> 14:58.564
-l love the sound of your voice right now.
-That's because l'm already drunk.

14:58.648 --> 15:03.110
Good for you. Just one more minute.
My husband got some good news.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.614
-Make a reservation. Surprise me.
-Okay.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.369
-l should call my mother.
-Peter.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.290
Don't go to the well. There's no water there.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.420
l don't even know if l'm getting a raise.
l didn't ask. l forgot.

15:21.504 --> 15:25.465
That's very noble. You see?
One doesn't need money to be fulfilled.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.677
Don't let those ladies from the Met
hear you say that.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.597
-l should go.
-Bye.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.354
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.858
l heard you wanted to see me,
so l grabbed a sandwich.

15:44.027 --> 15:48.113
-What can l do for you?
-Mr. Peterson's left the agency.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.575
lf that's your news,
l think you've been scooped.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.076
So you've heard?

15:53.161 --> 15:56.872
Let's just say he did not
"go gentle into that good night."

15:57.498 --> 16:00.751
So you're probably wondering
where that leaves you.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.631
-Should l be worried?
-No, l should say not.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.134
We're making you head of accounts.

16:10.219 --> 16:14.097
Spectacular. Thanks a lot.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.060
We're charting the course
of transition right now.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.479
There are many details to come.

16:22.065 --> 16:25.609
l wouldn't be much of an account man
if l didn't ask what it pays.

16:25.693 --> 16:30.197
l wouldn't be much of a financial officer
if l wasn't prepared to disappoint you.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.242
lt's 21 , but we'll reevaluate this year.

16:35.912 --> 16:40.207
Ken, this is not for broadcast.
There'll be a formal announcement.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.084
Great.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.482
You believe this?
What is the world coming to?

17:05.775 --> 17:09.611
-That is a big bottle.
-That's not a bottle. That's his date.

17:09.862 --> 17:14.533
-"My, oh, my, what a big bottle you have."
-"l'm sorry, honey, but l'm taken.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.496
"l just pawned my typewriter
so we could be together all weekend."

17:19.706 --> 17:23.500
The captain's about to announce
our descent into Friendship. Quick refill?

17:23.584 --> 17:27.129
l don't know.
Don't you need something to run the plane?

17:27.630 --> 17:30.674
-And what about you, Mr. Hofstadt?
-Excuse me?

17:31.592 --> 17:35.053
l took a look at your luggage.
You're William Hofstadt?

17:36.806 --> 17:41.643
Bill. Call me Bill.
And this is my associate, Mr. Fleischmann.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.479
-Sam.
-Shelley.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.651
-Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?
-Baltimore.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.946
Well, how about that?
We're heading to Hausner's for dinner.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.074
You should've been in line two hours ago
if you want to eat by 8:00.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.494
Lorelei has made some inroads
with the maitre d'.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.664
Well, we have to check in,
and we have an early meeting.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.375
-Where are you staying?
-The Belvedere.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.170
Well, this is too much. Us, too.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.926
7:30. lt'll be a hoot and a half.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.266
Now you have to take
someone else's luggage. Bill Hoffman's.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.520
Hofstadt. My brother-in-law.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.607
He borrowed a suitcase
to go to Puerto Rico,

18:28.691 --> 18:32.694
but he never tires of putting his name
on other people's things.

18:34.113 --> 18:38.700
l've flown a few times, but l've never
actually seen a stewardess that game.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.660
Really?

18:43.915 --> 18:44.956
This is your captain...

18:46.751 --> 18:49.795
Hello, Kenny. Any plans tonight?

18:50.880 --> 18:55.634
All l know is to avoid Grand Central.
l heard Burt Peterson's still at the bar.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.721
Oh, no. lt had to happen, l guess.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.810
He didn't put up much of a fight.
Not counting today, l mean.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.146
-lt's a tough job.
-No doubt about that.

19:25.623 --> 19:29.876
l just want to let you know,
l've always been a big fan of your work,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.754
and l've been very vocal about it.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.924
l appreciate that.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.387
Maybe now things will finally settle down.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.098
That's true.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.772
Listen, l just want to say
that through all of this,

19:51.774 --> 19:55.652
l know that you were there reminding me
that l can do this job.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.615
Well, you're welcome.
l guess it's because l think you can.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.996
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.043
And my friend and l were listening
to some radio program,

20:12.128 --> 20:14.963
and we had this huge bag of Fritos...

20:15.548 --> 20:17.883
We're not allowed in uniform...

20:17.967 --> 20:21.970
So, at some point my friend stops eating,
but l can't.

20:24.473 --> 20:30.353
And l ate all of them and l got so...
lt was quite unladylike.

20:32.815 --> 20:37.986
-And l still can't eat them to today.
-Too much of a good thing. lt happens.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.780
l think accounting sounds fascinating.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.576
Going through other people's
bank accounts? lt sounds sexy.

20:45.661 --> 20:49.748
Jesus, Lorelei, how deep
did you have to dig to come up with that?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.501
Why would you insult a man's profession?

20:54.211 --> 20:58.298
No, it's okay. l don't usually tell people
l'm an accountant.

20:59.675 --> 21:04.179
Listen, Billy, Sam,
l didn't mean to insult your profession.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.389
Don't sweat it.

21:08.434 --> 21:12.395
Of course, you do know
there are different kinds of accountants.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.939
Are there?

21:15.816 --> 21:19.486
-Tell them what we do.
-l don't know, Bill.

21:22.615 --> 21:27.410
-l'm gonna have to swear you all to secrecy.
-You can't guarantee that.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.956
You're right.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.670
Well, someone just brought everything
to a screeching halt.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.296
We'll be good.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.805
You ever heard of James Hoffa?

21:46.889 --> 21:51.351
You know, l don't just throw away
newspapers every day, l also read them.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.896
There is a lot of money missing.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.566
And they don't really keep receipts.

21:59.694 --> 22:03.238
-So you're a couple of G-men?
-No, we're accountants.

22:09.453 --> 22:13.164
lsn't the service exquisite?
l'm based in New York.

22:13.416 --> 22:17.711
l'd always rather be there,
but it's my job to be out of town.

22:21.507 --> 22:25.510
l don't know. l keep going to a lot of places

22:25.594 --> 22:28.388
and ending up somewhere
l've already been.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.438
-How about a nightcap?
-Well, l don't know.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.483
Your face is red.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.032
Order for us.

23:11.307 --> 23:16.019
Felt self-conscious there for a moment.
We're the only ones without a uniform.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.275
-Good night, Bill.
-Sam.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.612
Shelley, it's been swelly.

23:35.664 --> 23:41.044
-Well, this is me.
-Let me see if it's different than my floor.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.327
What are we doing?

24:16.539 --> 24:18.039
l don't know.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.010
l'm engaged.

24:34.849 --> 24:39.018
On the other hand,
you might be my last chance.

24:44.567 --> 24:49.112
l've been married a long time.
You get plenty of chances.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.208
lt's my birthday.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.922
Really? ls it?

25:10.384 --> 25:11.843
lt really is.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.806
Let me see your driver's license.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.727
That's not gonna help.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.233
Happy birthday.

26:05.481 --> 26:10.693
Hello. My air conditioner does not work.
lt is stagnant in here.

26:13.656 --> 26:16.157
Take your hand out. l can't breathe.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.414
Stand up.

26:26.460 --> 26:30.880
Lorelei thinks you look like Ty Power.
Remember him?

26:37.680 --> 26:38.846
Go on.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.945
And while you're distracted,
l'm gonna take off my shoes. ls that okay?

27:04.915 --> 27:06.249
Your turn.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.377
Not yet.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.563
Do you like?

27:30.941 --> 27:35.403
Everyone's always asking me
if l was a model, but l wasn't.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.371
The one l have at home is different.
Hope l didn't break it.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.835
No, it's fine. Just a minute.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.048
Thank you.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.632
Airplane.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.605
Oh, God.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.331
Jesus.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.629
-What is that?
-Fire alarm.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.717
Come on, let's go.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.185
Come on. Forget your shoes.
Let's go. Come on.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.620
Come on.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.564
Do you have another cigarette?

30:23.614 --> 30:25.656
Everything's okay, folks.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.051
-Morning.
-Morning.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.472
You ever get nervous
wearing that on the subway?

30:49.556 --> 30:53.559
l don't ride the subway.
l do worry about being followed, though.

30:55.437 --> 30:59.106
l think Lola takes a horse and buggy.
She's never on time.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.027
-l'm not at work yet.
-l don't want to sit in my office

31:03.111 --> 31:05.988
and listen to someone
talk about their water retention.

31:06.073 --> 31:10.618
-Peggy, brides are very self-conscious.
-lf she's so worried about getting married,

31:10.702 --> 31:14.205
then why is she shamelessly flirting
with Moneypenny all the time?

31:14.289 --> 31:18.209
-Don't call him that. He hates that.
-Are you defending him?

31:19.419 --> 31:22.129
He's repellant. Reminds me of a doorman.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.967
And the typing she does for him?

31:26.176 --> 31:29.136
Oh, God, l'm so glad
l'm gonna be out of here soon.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.807
-That's very comforting, Joan.
-There's nothing l can do.

31:36.270 --> 31:39.313
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

31:39.648 --> 31:43.776
Mr. Pryce just called. There's a meeting
for the heads of accounts immediately.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.902
Excuse me?

31:44.987 --> 31:48.531
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting
for you and Mr. Cosgrove.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.867
What are you talking about?

31:54.580 --> 31:57.540
Whatever the circumstances,
it's nice to see you.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.459
l'm just here to show you
the continuity of our service.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.838
That with or without Burt Peterson,
you are on our mind.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.473
-l apologize.
-Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.268
l don't know how,
but l left my plane ticket at the hotel.

32:17.352 --> 32:21.856
He's the guy with the marker who always
does what l say. Words, pictures.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.525
-Sal, this is Howard.
-Pleasure.

32:26.445 --> 32:31.365
-l don't remember... Do you have a family?
-Not yet. l have a wife.

32:32.868 --> 32:36.412
Well, Howard is my son.
He's gonna be part of this from now on,

32:36.496 --> 32:39.665
starting with taking you two gentlemen
on a tour.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.712
That's it? You're not gonna say anything?

32:47.007 --> 32:50.635
My father is extremely concerned
about the business right now.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.428
Well, is it about our work?

32:52.512 --> 32:54.847
l mean, we don't want
to take credit for everything,

32:54.931 --> 32:57.808
but two of every three raincoats
sold last year

32:57.893 --> 33:00.144
had "London Fog"
stitched on the inside pocket.

33:00.228 --> 33:04.065
Dad is worried that everyone who's ever
going to buy a raincoat already has one.

33:04.149 --> 33:08.319
Because a business has to get bigger
every year. That's capitalism.

33:12.240 --> 33:17.953
Well, our worst fears lie in anticipation.
That's not me, that's Balzac.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.749
Balzac, huh? You are not Burt Peterson.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.211
l've been investigating umbrellas,
bags, hats.

33:25.295 --> 33:28.506
There are companies
that all they do is make hats.

33:29.883 --> 33:34.261
London Fog is a 40-year-old brand
that sounds like it's existed forever.

33:34.805 --> 33:39.100
You've established, with our help,
that it means one thing, raincoats.

33:39.434 --> 33:43.896
New products aside, there will be fat years
and there will be lean years,

33:44.064 --> 33:46.023
but it is going to rain.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.362
That's true.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.784
Let's see if we can find you some earplugs.

34:00.038 --> 34:05.292
Bacardi, Belle Jolie, Birds Eye,
Cadbury, Campbell Soup lnternational,

34:05.627 --> 34:09.463
Cartwright double-sided aluminum,
Chevron oil, Dunkin' Donuts,

34:09.631 --> 34:14.760
General Foods Europe, Kodak,
Lever Brothers, Martinsons, Popsicle,

34:15.053 --> 34:18.264
Relaxacisor, Rio De Janeiro,
which is dormant,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.142
United Fruit, Warner Brothers.

34:22.644 --> 34:26.731
And now for Mr. Campbell.
Admiral Television, Alpine Real Estate,

34:26.857 --> 34:32.737
Bethlehem Steel, Con Ed, Gillette, Gorton's,
Liberty Capital Savings, Lucky Strike,

34:32.821 --> 34:38.367
Maytag, North American Aviation,
P&G Pampers, Playtex, Samsonite,

34:38.493 --> 34:41.078
Secor Laxatives, Snyder's Ketchup, Utz.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.998
-Why does he have Utz?
-Some of this was done based on accounts,

34:44.082 --> 34:46.333
and some of this was done
based on relationships,

34:46.418 --> 34:49.295
and you figure out what happened with Utz.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.672
So you decided all of this?

34:51.798 --> 34:53.632
Forty-two cents of every dollar
at this agency

34:53.717 --> 34:57.178
is spent in the television department,
but no, we did.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.016
-What are these "O's" for?
-Olson.

35:02.184 --> 35:04.685
-She's all over the place.
-You know that's not true.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.313
You're each taking half the company.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.692
Of course it's possible
someone could distinguish themselves.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.778
Would be easier that way.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.709
-Can you believe this?
-lf you're upset, you seem to be hiding it.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.338
l'm excited.
l mean, l feel badly about Burt Peterson.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.465
Three kids, wife with cancer.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.885
But you greased up the chute
and shoved him down it.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.513
What could possibly be the matter?

35:40.597 --> 35:44.141
Why did you even accept this?
You have no interest in this.

35:44.226 --> 35:47.520
-Why wouldn't l want this?
-Because you're no good.

35:48.563 --> 35:52.566
They want us to hate each other.
l refuse to participate in that.

35:53.443 --> 35:56.779
Very nice. Very, very nice.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.574
Look at you. Never break a sweat.

36:00.700 --> 36:05.454
You're right, l should just lay down and we
should run together, holding hands.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.098
-What time is it?
-1 :1 5.

36:25.642 --> 36:30.145
-We should be back in the office by 3:00.
-We're going back to the office?

36:39.990 --> 36:41.365
l'm going to ask you something,

36:41.449 --> 36:44.535
and l want you
to be completely honest with me.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.459
London Fog.

36:56.673 --> 37:00.801
lt's a subway car,
and there's a commuter looking up.

37:01.803 --> 37:06.599
There's a girl with her back to us.
She's wearing one of those short tan ones,

37:06.683 --> 37:09.143
but it's open. Her legs are bare.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.605
We know what he's seeing.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.026
"Limit your exposure."

37:21.489 --> 37:22.823
That's it.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.829
Good.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.595
Mr. Hooker, may l speak with you?

37:48.850 --> 37:53.395
l thought it was a good idea that PPL
had an office for when visitors come.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.939
Of course,
it would make sense for someone

37:55.023 --> 37:57.524
to be occupying it in the meantime.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.111
l rustled up an office for you.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.989
l hope you find it appropriate
to your status.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.491
My position.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.786
lt's near Mr. Pryce.
lt's not exactly in the thick of things,

38:08.870 --> 38:10.704
but you will have someone
to attend to your typing,

38:10.789 --> 38:13.290
to avoid you siphoning off the man-hours.

38:13.375 --> 38:17.419
-My own girl? Of my choosing?
-l will have a lineup.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.297
Did he take the ant farm?

38:20.382 --> 38:23.717
No, it's actually Mr. Cooper's.
lt just lives there.

38:28.932 --> 38:33.978
Hello, sweetheart. Now, don't be cross.
l'll only be a minute.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.400
-Do you have a fever?
-No.

38:49.244 --> 38:52.413
"The buck stops here,"
unless it stops over there.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.498
What's the matter?

38:54.582 --> 38:58.752
There's two heads of accounts.
Kenny Cosgrove and l are sharing it.

39:01.089 --> 39:05.801
-l'm so sorry.
-l was sitting there and they just read off

39:05.885 --> 39:10.055
a list of names, a list of companies.
That's my life.

39:16.896 --> 39:21.692
l know you won't like hearing this,
but you're a lot like my father.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.278
You're an ambitious man,

39:24.362 --> 39:27.531
and an ambitious man is never happy
with what he has.

39:27.615 --> 39:32.161
Why does it always have to be like this?
Why can't l get anything good all at once?

39:32.245 --> 39:37.374
This is an amazing opportunity.
They believe in you. Don't turn it sour.

39:37.584 --> 39:41.420
lt's a test. Why not just cut it short
and tell them l want it?

39:41.504 --> 39:45.466
You can do whatever you want,
but they do not want to hear your outrage.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.261
-They want you to beat Ken.
-l know what they want, Trudy.

39:49.971 --> 39:54.349
And honestly, l don't know.
l can't live with this!

40:00.607 --> 40:02.149
But you'll try.

40:08.448 --> 40:13.660
lt's great. lt's a great ad.
So, how was everything in Baltimore?

40:14.370 --> 40:16.330
Out of town. Don Draper.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.832
-lt was first class.
-Go on.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.918
Two old married men.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.420
There was a fire in the hotel,
but no casualties.

40:23.505 --> 40:24.922
That's too bad.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.592
For casting this lucky fellow in the subway,
what's he look like?

40:28.676 --> 40:32.846
l don't know. A little excited.
A little shocked.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.725
-No, what's he look like?
-Handsome.

40:43.191 --> 40:48.278
Your girl's gone.
l have Stolichnaya and Cuban cigars.

40:48.571 --> 40:52.324
l sent them from Greece.
l should've tried a pound of opium.

40:55.078 --> 40:59.706
Help yourself.
So, Cosgrove versus Campbell.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.752
ls Cooper playing God or Darwin?

41:03.837 --> 41:06.880
l know it sounds Japanese,
but it's not Cooper.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.300
Lane read about it
in some management book?

41:10.385 --> 41:13.011
l think it came from the home office.

41:14.597 --> 41:17.224
When he told me about it,
l thought he was joking.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.812
l told him it was a stupid idea,
but they don't always get our inflection.

41:24.357 --> 41:27.276
-Can l speak with you for a moment?
-Come in.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.367
What?

41:35.577 --> 41:36.577
l...

41:39.914 --> 41:44.293
l just wanted to let you both know
how honored l am with this promotion.

41:46.129 --> 41:49.923
Help yourself. Not the Stoli.

41:51.843 --> 41:56.722
Hello. Mr. Campbell, l was going to tell Don,

41:56.806 --> 41:59.183
but l can tell you myself.

42:01.227 --> 42:06.982
l have an old pal at the mayor's office
that wants to do a small campaign for...

42:07.442 --> 42:11.445
l don't know,
something about Penn Station.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.948
lt'd be my pleasure. Bert?

42:16.618 --> 42:18.368
ls there any brandy?

42:19.954 --> 42:21.622
Any glass will do.

42:24.209 --> 42:27.628
l told him that despite life
under British rule,

42:28.504 --> 42:31.256
we still had a real Yankee.

42:34.719 --> 42:40.557
l don't care what they say.
London Fog is a great name.

42:51.861 --> 42:56.156
l like the ants.
There's no shortage of distractions here.

42:56.991 --> 43:00.494
Now, if we can find a proper pub,
we'll have everything.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.166
Why do you have this office?

43:06.251 --> 43:10.671
l thought it was necessary that we have
a place for when superiors visit.

43:11.673 --> 43:15.425
Of course, it would make sense
for someone to occupy it in the meantime.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.552
lt's a harebrained idea.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.848
We just fired one third of their workforce.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.143
lt's unseemly
to go through their pockets as well.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.523
A visitor's office is good,
but you sit out front.

43:29.983 --> 43:32.276
Of course. lt was presumptuous.

43:38.408 --> 43:42.202
-This place is a gynocracy.
-Hadn't noticed.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.626
My only point is,
if you decide to take the train tomorrow

43:49.711 --> 43:52.963
and you run into Carlton,
l told them we were busy.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.091
Our stories are straight.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.636
Sally has something to tell you. Sally!

44:00.805 --> 44:03.724
l got it out of her. Out.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.232
Go ahead.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.611
l'm sorry l broke your suitcase.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.742
Find out how much it is to repair,
and it'll come out of your allowance.

44:21.826 --> 44:25.203
-l don't have an allowance.
-Then don't break things.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.459
l just thought... l just didn't want you to go.

44:34.047 --> 44:35.380
Come here.

44:39.218 --> 44:44.222
l will always come home,
and you'll always be my girl.

44:59.614 --> 45:04.618
-Your eyes look tired.
-l don't sleep well when l'm not here.

45:06.329 --> 45:09.664
You squint too much.
You need reading glasses.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.795
Daddy, Daddy! Are these for me?

45:17.131 --> 45:20.384
-Yes.
-Give me that. lt's a stickpin.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.810
There you go.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.481
-Was l really in there?
-Nine months.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.819
Tell me about the day l was born.

45:46.244 --> 45:51.248
Well, it was the middle of the night,

45:52.917 --> 45:56.294
and it was raining very hard.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.842
And l had just come home from work.

46:09.475 --> 46:13.103
He did not feel like getting back in the car,
but he did.

46:14.188 --> 46:17.732
He took my suitcase
and my little stuffed Eeyore

46:17.817 --> 46:20.360
that l knew l was going to give you.
