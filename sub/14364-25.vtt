09:10.754 --> 09:12.353
Because this particular endeavor

09:12.355 --> 09:16.624

The power of a Prime.

09:24.267 --> 09:28.002
Optimus may be the only one
who can defeat Unicron,

09:28.004 --> 09:31.272
but I remain the only one
who can guide you to him.

09:31.274 --> 09:33.908
Unicron's lifeblood runs through me.

09:33.910 --> 09:38.313

as it's mutually beneficial.

10:06.176 --> 10:10.945

Brutal honesty

Even if we agree,

10:54.090 --> 10:56.424
Unicron's all the way down

10:56.426 --> 10:58.459
How are we supposed
to get there -- drive?

11:07.671 --> 11:12.574
But plotting a blind jump
inside of a sentient being?!

11:12.576 --> 11:15.376
Besides, direct exposure
to that much Dark Energon

11:15.378 --> 11:17.412

You haven't built up an immunity
like Megatron has.

11:20.317 --> 11:26.354
Yet another strong argument
for soliciting... my guidance.

11:26.356 --> 11:29.424
You can provide
Unicron's exact coordinates?

11:29.426 --> 11:33.661
If you transport us
to this planet's core,

11:33.663 --> 11:37.198
I can lead you
directly into Unicron's spark...

11:37.200 --> 11:41.336
the very heart of his darkness.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.970
Optimus, even if we
survive the jump,

11:46.972 --> 11:48.638
how are we supposed
to stop Unicron?

11:54.045 --> 11:57.347
With the Matrix of Leadership.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.282
What is that?

11:59.284 --> 12:01.818
A vessel of pure energy,

12:01.820 --> 12:04.854
the collective wisdom
of the Primes.

12:04.856 --> 12:07.390
Do we have time
for a scavenger hunt?

12:07.392 --> 12:10.627
I mean, where's Optimus supposed
to find this Matrix?

12:10.629 --> 12:13.363
Optimus does not need
to find it.

12:13.365 --> 12:16.466
He carries it within him.

12:16.468 --> 12:19.936
It was the combined power
of the Primes

12:19.938 --> 12:23.139
that defeated Unicron
so long ago,

12:23.141 --> 12:26.576
the very reason
he now seeks to destroy you.

12:26.578 --> 12:29.446
It would follow that unleashing
the power of the Matrix

12:29.448 --> 12:31.615
directly into Unicron's spark

12:31.617 --> 12:34.384

Hold on.

12:36.321 --> 12:40.657
If "everything goes right,"
Unicron's gonna stay down there?

Yeah. Can't we
siphon him out somehow?

12:44.162 --> 12:46.663
He's not in the earth's core, Jack.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.165
He is the earth's core.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.134
Rafael is correct.

12:51.136 --> 12:54.337
Tampering with your core

19:10.181 --> 19:11.981
since we first met.

19:11.983 --> 19:15.952
As such, I feel you have earned
the responsibility

19:15.954 --> 19:19.255
of safeguarding
this important device

19:19.257 --> 19:21.024
until I return.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.827
I won't let you down.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.541
Locked and ready.

19:44.815 --> 19:46.516
You first.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.985
As you wish.

20:27.491 --> 20:29.525
[ heart beating ]

20:40.471 --> 20:46.242
So, how long before Unicron
knows we're here?

20:46.244 --> 20:51.347
Make no mistake...
he already does.

20:51.349 --> 20:54.050
