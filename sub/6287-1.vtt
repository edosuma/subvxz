he didn't see what I saw.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.363

46:15.856 --> 46:17.904
Look. I found this on the web.

46:18.025 --> 46:21.575
And this is from the year 1832.

46:21.696 --> 46:22.743
I know.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.241
That's the inspiration
for the Hall of Horrors.

46:25.366 --> 46:28.085
Dr. Hysteria copied
that character's looks,

46:28.202 --> 46:30.313
but he thought that
Hall of Horrors sounded

46:30.413 --> 46:34.254
more modern than Carnival
of Creeps, so he changed that.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.547

46:35.668 --> 46:38.279
So he isn't almost 200 years old.

sometimes he smells like it.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.434
Okay, that was really good.

47:25.593 --> 47:27.703
Kellen, if she knows
about the Cabinet of Souls,

47:27.803 --> 47:29.163

pays any attention to me,

47:36.103 --> 47:37.150

Yeah. About 500 of them.

want to work in the show.

The first thing that we're gonna
need to do is find my friends.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:55.603
And if they're okay?

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.498
Then I guess I'm gonna have to admit

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.726
that this whole thing
has been in my mind.

I don't know.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:36.977
Let's try down here.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.585
Come to this side.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.028
It's wonderful.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.189
Join me.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:31.441
I will.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.537
- You can't go over there.
- You can't leave us.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:37.680
We need you.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:38.765
HUNTER: You're free without them.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.015
This is where you belong.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.537
It's who you really are.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.286
No, that's not who I am.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:48.879
This isn't right.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.349
Your friends are holding you back.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.352
I would never betray
my friends like that.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.196
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.323
Beth!

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:17.470
We should go back in there.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:18.638
No.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.807
I mean, what's going on
in there is obviously

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.309
some kind of sorcery, and it's wrong.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:26.207
It's showing us what we could be,

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.756
the two of us together.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.251
Who are you?

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.550
Don't be stupid, Beth.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:39.158
Showing loyalty to my friends
is not stupidity, Hunter.

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.430
What about your loyalty to me?

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.188
I don't owe you loyalty!

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.437
What's wrong, brother?

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.277
Isn't she cooperating?

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:50.502
Brother?

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:51.837
No, she's not cooperating.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.006
She's being a stubborn little fool.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.450
LILITH: Calm down, Hunter.

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:58.027
He didn't mean that.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.413
He cares about you, Beth.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.457
We all do.

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:09.623
Get away.

Where's my broomstick?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.762
Who stole my broomstick?

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.145
Wait a minute!

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.374
You stole it.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:29.566
No, I didn't.
