00:02.502 --> 00:03.420
{\an8}- I CANNOT WAIT TO GET TO
THE JERSEY SHORE.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.755
{\an8}- THE SUMMER,
EVERYONE GOES TO THE SHORE.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.923
{\an8}- GETTING A JERSEY SHORE HOUSE
IS WILD.

00:07.006 --> 00:08.800
{\an8}- THAT'S WHEN
THE SHIRTS COME OFF

00:08.883 --> 00:10.260
{\an8}AND THE BIKINIS COME OUT.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.553
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE.

00:11.636 --> 00:14.639
{\an8}- A SHARE HOUSE IS
SIX TO TEN PEOPLE.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.765
{\an8}- IT'S CRAZY.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.726
{\an8}YOU HAVE STRANGERS LIVING
WITH YOU THE WHOLE SUMMER.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.436
{\an8}- THE NIGHTLIFE, THE GIRLS.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.439
{\an8}- GUIDOS EVERYWHERE,
HOT GIRLS, AND HOUSE MUSIC.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.648
{\an8}- I WANT TO GET INTO THE HOUSE,
I WANT TO MEET SOME GIRLS,

00:23.732 --> 00:25.942
{\an8}I WANT TO MEET SOME GUYS,
I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:26.025 --> 00:26.192
{\an8}I'M READY TO GO.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.949
{\an8}- OUT HERE IN RHODE ISLAND,

00:33.032 --> 00:35.452
{\an8}GUIDOS, WHEN WE STOP,
OUR CHROME KEEPS SPINNING.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.372
{\an8}I WAS BORN AND RAISED A GUIDO.
IT'S JUST A LIFESTYLE.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.457
{\an8}IT'S BEING ITALIAN.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.126
{\an8}IT'S REPRESENTING
FAMILY, FRIENDS,

00:43.209 --> 00:44.627
{\an8}TANNING, GEL, EVERYTHING.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.171
{\an8}I GOT A TANNING BED
AT MY PLACE.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.964
{\an8}THAT'S HOW SERIOUS I AM
ABOUT BEING A GUIDO

00:48.047 --> 00:49.382
{\an8}AND LIVING UP
TO THAT LIFESTYLE.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.551
{\an8}MY TAGLINE IS
I'M YOUR GIRL'S FAVORITE DJ.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.969
{\an8}[record skips]

00:53.052 --> 00:55.096
{\an8}I WANT THE GUIDETTES
TO [bleep] IN THEIR PANTS

00:55.180 --> 00:56.222
{\an8}WHEN THEY HEAR MY MUSIC.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.432
{\an8}ALL THE LADIES
ARE FIGHTING TO SEE

00:57.515 --> 00:58.975
{\an8}WHO'S GOING HOME
WITH THE DJ.

00:59.058 --> 00:59.559
{\an8}I DON'T TRY TO TAKE A LOT OF
GUYS' GIRLFRIENDS,

00:59.642 --> 01:00.894
{\an8}BUT IT JUST HAPPENS.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
{\an8}THEY'LL END UP LEAVING THEM
FOR ME.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.938
{\an8}IT TAKES ME ABOUT 25 MINUTES
TO DO MY HAIR.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.232
{\an8}IT COMES OUT PERFECT
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.652
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO
JERSEY WITHOUT MY HAIR GEL.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.739
{\an8}CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT MY GEL.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.740
{\an8}WHEN I HIT THE JERSEY SHORE,
THEY'RE GONNA SEE A NEW GUIDO.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.618
{\an8}EVERY GIRL LOVES THE NEW GUY.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.998
{\an8}- I'M GOING
TO JERSEY SHORE, BITCH!

01:22.081 --> 01:22.624
{\an8}THANKS.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.168
{\an8}I WANT TO MARRY A GUIDO.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.045
{\an8}MY ULTIMATE DREAM IS
TO MOVE TO JERSEY,

01:27.128 --> 01:29.506
{\an8}FIND A NICE, JUICED,
HOT, TAN GUY,

01:29.589 --> 01:30.882
{\an8}AND LIVE MY LIFE.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.635
{\an8}GUIDO APPLICATIONS
ACCEPTED OVER HERE!

01:33.718 --> 01:37.514
{\an8}I LOVE GUIDOS!
LET'S GO.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.017
{\an8}I LIKE TAN, ITALIAN BOYS
WITH MUSCLES.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.018
{\an8}SIZE DOES NOT MATTER.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.020
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
EVEN THOUGH I'M SMALL,

01:44.103 --> 01:45.730
{\an8}I HAVE A LOUD MOUTH,

01:45.814 --> 01:46.856
{\an8}I STICK UP FOR MYSELF,
AND I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

01:46.940 --> 01:48.191
{\an8}YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

01:48.274 --> 01:49.734
{\an8}UNTIL YOU SEE ME
AT THE JERSEY [bleep] SHORE.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.278
{\an8}SEE YOU LATER, MA.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.951
{\an8}- THIS IS THE SITUATION
RIGHT HERE.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.912
{\an8}MY ABS ARE SO RIPPED UP,
IT'S-- WE CALL IT THE SITUATION.

02:02.121 --> 02:06.417
{\an8}A GUIDO IS A GOOD-LOOKING,
SMOOTH, WELL-DRESSED ITALIAN.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.169
{\an8}LOOKS GOOD.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.045
{\an8}I CHECK OUT THE MIRROR
AND, LIKE, "WHOO.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.339
{\an8}TODAY'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY."

02:11.422 --> 02:13.007
{\an8}GIRLS LOVE GUIDOS.
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.885
{\an8}I KNOW GIRLS THAT JUST GO
FOR THAT.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.053
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU CAN HATE ON ME
ALL YOU WANT TO,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.222
{\an8}BUT WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY
TO SOMEBODY

02:19.305 --> 02:22.475
{\an8}WHO LOOKS LIKE RAMBO PRETTY MUCH
WITH HIS SHIRT OFF?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.562
{\an8}WE USUALLY WORK OUT
AT LEAST FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.481
{\an8}IF I WALKED IN THE DOOR
AND SEEN MYSELF,

02:28.565 --> 02:30.191
{\an8}I'D PROBABLY GRAB MY GIRL
REAL QUICK.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.238
{\an8}- I'M KNOWN AROUND TOWN
AS SAMMI SWEETHEART.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.158
{\an8}I'M THE SWEETEST BITCH
YOU'LL EVER MEET,

02:39.242 --> 02:40.743
{\an8}BUT DO NOT [bleep] WITH ME.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.078
{\an8}I'M NOT LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.246
{\an8}I AM LOOKING TO BREAK
A LOT OF HEARTS

02:43.329 --> 02:47.417
{\an8}AND TO GET WITH A LOT
OF GOOD, HOT, SEXY GUIDOS.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.210
{\an8}YOUR NUMBER ONE MISSION
IS TO GO OUT

02:49.294 --> 02:51.004
{\an8}AND FIND THE HOTTEST GUIDO
AND TAKE HIM HOME.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.297
{\an8}THE SMALLER THE SHORTS,
THE BETTER,

02:52.380 --> 02:55.550
{\an8}BECAUSE ALL THE LITTLE
GUIDO GUYS OUT THERE LOVE THEM.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.594
{\an8}I LOVE TO GET DOLLED UP.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.596
{\an8}I LOVE TO LOOK GOOD.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.223
{\an8}I CAN NEVER GO OUT
WITHOUT MY HAIR EXTENSIONS.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.101
{\an8}A GUIDETTE IS SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS HOW TO CLUB IT UP,

03:05.184 --> 03:05.935
{\an8}TAKES REALLY GOOD CARE
OF THEMSELVES,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.438

{\an8}IF YOU'RE NOT A GUIDO,

03:15.236 --> 03:16.613
{\an8}THEN YOU CAN GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF MY FACE.

{\an8}SHE LOVES ME TO DEATH.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.134
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS IN MY FAMILY.

03:38.217 --> 03:41.012
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY
A GENERATIONAL ITALIAN.

AND THE FAKE TANS

03:44.557 --> 03:46.476

03:48.728 --> 03:50.813
{\an8}MOST PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER
BEING A GUIDO,

03:50.897 --> 03:52.148
{\an8}LIKE, YOU'RE STUPID,

03:52.231 --> 03:55.151
{\an8}BUT I WENT TO SCHOOL,
GRADUATED COLLEGE.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.737
{\an8}THAT DOESN'T SHY AWAY FROM,
SAY, I DON'T HAVE FUN AT NIGHT.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.821
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.573
{\an8}AND I PARTY AND FIST-PUMP
LIKE THE BEST OF 'EM.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.617
{\an8}AND THEN IT STARTS,
AND THEN IT COMES UP,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.452
{\an8}AND THEN IT COMES UP,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN!

04:04.535 --> 04:08.456

A [bleep] GUIDO.

AT THE JERSEY SHORE.

04:16.964 --> 04:17.757
{\an8}YOU AIN'T GETTING IN
WITH A FAKE I.D.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.927
{\an8}IT'S 21 LONG YEARS
OF ANTICIPATION

04:21.010 --> 04:23.429
{\an8}TO GO TO THESE PLACES,
AND, ONCE YOU GET THERE,

04:23.513 --> 04:24.347
{\an8}YOU'RE LIKE, "HOLY [bleep].

04:24.430 --> 04:26.140

{\an8}LIKE ANY TRADITIONAL
ITALIAN KID.

{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:35.650 --> 04:36.859

{\an8}AFTER I HAVE SEX WITH A GUY,
I WILL RIP THEIR HEADS OFF.

{\an8}LET THE PARTY BEGIN, BITCH.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.164
{\an8}I HAVE A BAD HABIT OF PLAYING

04:50.248 --> 04:53.042
{\an8}LITTLE EMOTIONAL GAMES
WITH MEN.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.168
{\an8}WHEN THEY DATE ME,
IT'S COOL IN THE BEGINNING.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.546

IN THE FIRST MONTH,

04:56.629 --> 04:58.548
{\an8}AND THEN I SEND 'EM ON
A ROLLER COASTER RIDE TO HELL.

{\an8}NEVER EVER, EVER, EVER.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.995
{\an8}I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT LOVE MEANS.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.581
{\an8}THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THIS IS
PRETTY MUCH GETTING LAID.

{\an8}JUST TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF
AND THEY COME TO YOU.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.417
{\an8}IT'S LIKE A FLY
COMES TO [bleep].

05:34.500 --> 05:36.210
{\an8}FIRST IMPRESSION
IS EVERYTHING.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.545
{\an8}EVERYWHERE YOU GO,

05:37.628 --> 05:38.254
{\an8}YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING A FIRST
IMPRESSION ON SOMEBODY.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.548
{\an8}THE BANK ACCOUNT CAN BE LOW,

05:40.631 --> 05:42.383
{\an8}BUT ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK GOOD,
ALWAYS HAVE TO GET A HAIRCUT,

05:42.467 --> 05:43.593
{\an8}ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE
NEW SNEAKERS,

05:43.676 --> 05:44.927
{\an8}ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK FRESH.

{\an8}A GUY THAT ALWAYS LOOKS
PRETTIER THAN HIS GIRLFRIEND,

05:52.393 --> 05:54.771
{\an8}WHICH IS COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.813
{\an8}I CAN'T BE WITH A GIRL THAT
DOESN'T LOOK PRETTIER THAN ME.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.484
{\an8}LET'S GO.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.570

[bleep], AND THE BEACH.

ABOUT THE JERSEY SHORE.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.126
{\an8}I AM ALL NATURAL.
I HAVE REAL BOOBS.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.003
{\an8}I HAVE A NICE, FAT ASS.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.714
{\an8}LOOK AT THIS [bleep].
I MEAN, COME ON, I'M HOT.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.800
{\an8}IF THERE'S EVER A TIME
WHERE I DON'T LOOK GOOD,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.385
{\an8}I DON'T WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.138
{\an8}I DON'T REALLY GO OUT
LOOKING FOR GUYS.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.223
{\an8}USUALLY THEY JUST COME UP
TO ME, AND I JUST--

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
{\an8}THAT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
WHAT HAPPENS.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.851
{\an8}YEAH, I'M VERY FRIENDLY.
I'M VERY OUTGOING.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.436
{\an8}BUT I COULD BE BITCHY TOO.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.854
{\an8}LIKE, DON'T GET
ON MY BITCHY SIDE.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.481
{\an8}DOESN'T THAT LOOK HOT ON ME?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.982
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU LOOKS REALLY GOOD
WITH THAT.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.192
{\an8}- NOW I HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
SO I GO OUT WITH HIM A LOT.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.319
{\an8}- SEE YOU LATER.
- LOVE YOU.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.947
{\an8}IT'S A BIG TEST FOR ME
AND MY BOYFRIEND

06:46.030 --> 06:47.657
{\an8}TO SEE IF HE'S GONNA BE OKAY
WITH ME BEING AWAY FROM HIM.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.242
{\an8}IF HE TRUSTS ME,
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.953
{\an8}IF HE DOESN'T, THEN I'M GONNA
HAVE TO MOVE ON, YOU KNOW?

06:52.036 --> 06:53.204
{\an8}WHEN I'M
IN THE JERSEY SHORE HOUSE,

06:53.287 --> 06:56.499
{\an8}I'M GONNA SHOW THEM WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE A REAL GUIDETTE.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.212
{\an8}- I'M READY TO PARTY
AND GET OUT OF CONTROL.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.297
{\an8}I'M SINGLE,
AND I CAN'T [bleep] WAIT

07:03.381 --> 07:04.841
{\an8}TO SEE WHAT'S GONNA GO DOWN.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.134
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BE READY

07:06.217 --> 07:07.969

08:13.534 --> 08:16.120
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IT HAD A NUMBER OF
ROOMS AND A NUMBER OF LEVELS.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.955

08:22.376 --> 08:24.003
{\an8}I WAS FIRST IN THE HOUSE
AND WAS ABLE TO DECIDE

08:24.086 --> 08:26.005
{\an8}WHERE I WANTED TO STAY.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.590
{\an8}YEAH.

{\an8}TO SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE
WERE JERK-OFFS,

08:31.052 --> 08:33.095
{\an8}TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY,
LIKE, HOT GIRLS POSSIBLY.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.306
{\an8}- I'M BRINGING NEW YORK
TO JERSEY, "A,"

08:35.389 --> 08:36.599
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DRIVE,

08:36.682 --> 08:38.058
{\an8}AND, "B," THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PARTY.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.477
{\an8}GET OUT OF MY [bleep] WAY.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.188

10:50.232 --> 10:51.734
{\an8}BY YOURSELF POSSIBLY

10:51.817 --> 10:52.902
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
GET STUCK WITH A JERK.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.820
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW
IF THE NEXT PERSON

10:54.904 --> 10:56.906
{\an8}IS GONNA BE SOMEONE
I WANT TO SLEEP WITH.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.908
{\an8}- DECISIONS, DECISIONS.
I DON'T CARE.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.409
{\an8}IF THE PERSON LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE I WANT TO ROOM WITH,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.745
{\an8}THEN I'LL LEAVE MY SUITCASES.

11:02.828 --> 11:06.207
{\an8}IF NOT, THEN I'M GOING TO

11:06.290 --> 11:07.416

{\an8}ALL I SEE IS BIG, FAKE BOOBS,

11:15.091 --> 11:16.092
{\an8}BLACK HAIR WITH BLONDE STREAK.

11:16.175 --> 11:20.054

11:20.137 --> 11:21.847
{\an8}- HE RAN DOWNSTAIRS.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.476
{\an8}- SO I MOVED THE BAGS
INTO THE BED THAT'S ISOLATED

11:25.559 --> 11:27.269
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULDN'T
SLEEP IN A ROOM WITH HER.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.230
{\an8}- EVERYBODY'S NOT HERE YET.
- NO, EVERYBODY'S NOT HERE.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.398
{\an8}YOU STILL GOT A LITTLE CHOICE
WHO YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.775
{\an8}- HI.
- HI, HONEY.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.485
{\an8}- WHY DON'T YOU PUT SOMETHING

11:34.568 --> 11:35.653
{\an8}JUST PUT SOME STUFF DOWN
FOR A SECOND THERE.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.655
{\an8}TAKE A LOAD OFF.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.032
{\an8}- J-WOW.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.200
{\an8}- NOT HATING ON THE GIRL,

11:41.283 --> 11:42.284
{\an8}BUT YOU CAN JUST SAY
YOUR REAL NAME TO ME.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.328
{\an8}I DON'T SAY, "HEY, WHAT'S UP?
MY NAME IS V-WOW."

11:44.412 --> 11:46.497
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.623
{\an8}- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THE SINGLE BED?

11:47.706 --> 11:48.290
{\an8}- I HAD TO.
- COME ON.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.626
{\an8}- I HAD TO. I'M SORRY.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.462
{\an8}- WHY IS IT MAKING
THAT TERRIBLE NOISE?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.297
{\an8}OH, GOD.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.715
{\an8}IF I HAVE TO WAIT
ONE MORE MINUTE

11:56.799 --> 11:58.259
{\an8}TO GET IN THIS FRIGGIN' HOUSE,
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY.

{\an8}YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE 'EM

24:56.203 --> 24:57.412
{\an8}AND THE GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO
EAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

24:57.495 --> 24:59.748

25:17.098 --> 25:19.601
{\an8}LIKE ANY TRADITIONAL ITALIAN
FAMILY WOULD.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.018
{\an8}DEAR GOD...

25:20.101 --> 25:24.397

25:28.193 --> 25:29.069
{\an8}[laughter]

25:29.152 --> 25:31.112

25:31.196 --> 25:32.572
{\an8}IT PISSED ME OFF
THAT VINNY WAS LAUGHING.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.782
{\an8}HE WAS MAKING
OTHER PEOPLE LAUGH.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.533
{\an8}DON'T MAKE A JOKE
OUT OF GRACE.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.993
{\an8}- THANK YOU

25:37.077 --> 25:38.995
{\an8}NEVER MIND.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.288

25:40.372 --> 25:43.208
{\an8}- I FEEL EMBARRASSED.
I FEEL STUPID.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.627

26:01.851 --> 26:03.144
{\an8}- I APPRECIATE THAT.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.437
{\an8}- HONESTLY,

IT'S GONNA CAUSE, LIKE, TENSION.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.339
{\an8}LET 'EM DO THEIR THING.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.299
{\an8}- HONESTLY, IT'S NOT GONNA
CAUSE ANY TENSION.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.301
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING TO, LIKE,
WORRY ABOUT.

{\an8}UNTIL I WATCHED, LIKE, THEM

WE'RE CLASSY GIRLS.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.089
{\an8}THEY'RE TAKING THEIR UNDERWEAR
OFF IN THE [bleep] JACUZZI.

34:52.172 --> 34:53.757
{\an8}ARE YOU DUMB? HELLO?

34:53.841 --> 34:56.135

{\an8}THIS IS MY [bleep] HOUSE TOO.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.305
{\an8}- DON'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH THEN.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.848
{\an8}- I'LL [bleep] OPEN MY MOUTH

35:00.932 --> 35:02.016
{\an8}WHEN I WANT TO [bleep] OPEN
MY MOUTH.

35:02.099 --> 35:03.226
{\an8}LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.852
{\an8}I TOLD THEM NOT TO
[bleep] BRING THE GIRLS

35:04.936 --> 35:05.937
{\an8}INTO THE [bleep] HOUSE

35:06.020 --> 35:07.647
{\an8}'CAUSE I KNEW THIS WAS
GONNA GO ON.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.190
{\an8}YOU WERE GONNA BITCH,
SHE WAS GONNA BITCH,

35:09.273 --> 35:10.900
{\an8}AND SHE WAS GONNA BITCH.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.193
{\an8}- THEN DON'T SAY,
"I LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU,"

35:12.276 --> 35:13.569
{\an8}TO OTHER GIRLS IN THE HOUSE,
NOT ME.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.196
{\an8}- HONESTLY, I DON'T SEE
WHAT JOLIE'S POINT WAS.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.364
{\an8}MY POINT WAS

35:16.447 --> 35:17.573
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO MESS AROUND
WITH A GIRL

35:17.657 --> 35:19.700
{\an8}IN THE HOUSE.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.202
{\an8}LIKE, THAT'S JUST
GONNA CAUSE PROBLEMS.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.871
{\an8}MIKE, YOU'RE THE ROOT TO
ALL PROBLEMS, BRO.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.207

POINT ANY FINGERS.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.041
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA POINT NO FINGERS
RIGHT NOW.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.043
{\an8}YOU KNOW, AT THIS
PARTICULAR POINT,

35:29.126 --> 35:30.044
{\an8}I COULD BE SCREWED RIGHT NOW.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.213
{\an8}I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS VIBING WITH SAM,

35:32.296 --> 35:34.382
{\an8}AND THEN, AT THE SAME TIME,
I WAS LIKE,

35:34.465 --> 35:35.883
{\an8}SHOULD I HAVE WENT FOR IT?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.552
{\an8}- YOU DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO,

35:37.635 --> 35:38.469
{\an8}BUT DON'T SIT THERE
AND SAY YOU LIKE HER

35:38.553 --> 35:40.346
{\an8}AND THEN GO IN A HOT TUB
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

35:40.429 --> 35:41.556
{\an8}THAT'S JUST NOT COOL.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.557
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS

35:42.640 --> 35:44.976
{\an8}WHY DOES EVERYBODY LIKE TO
LINK ME AND SAM?

35:45.059 --> 35:46.936
{\an8}WE JUST ROOMMATES.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.729
{\an8}- BECAUSE YOUR HEAD
IS SO FAR UP HER ASS,

35:48.813 --> 35:50.064
{\an8}YOU CAN SEE
OUT HER MOUTH, BRO.

35:50.147 --> 35:52.400
{\an8}THAT'S WHY.
HONESTLY, BRO.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.735
{\an8}LIKE, YOU GUYS WERE
HOLDING HANDS ALL NIGHT.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.445

{\an8}- YOU WANT TO LIKE A GIRL
IN THE HOUSE,

36:03.494 --> 36:04.579
{\an8}DON'T BRING DIRTY GIRLS BACK.

36:04.662 --> 36:05.955
{\an8}- I DIDN'T BRING
ANY DIRTY GIRLS BACK.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.916
{\an8}- DID HE PUT HIS LIPS
TO ANOTHER GIRL?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.420
{\an8}- SAM WAS LOOKING AT ME, LIKE,

36:12.503 --> 36:12.962
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

36:13.045 --> 36:15.673
{\an8}- DON'T, DON'T--NO.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.757
{\an8}DID HE PUT HIS LIPS
TO ANOTHER GIRL?

36:16.841 --> 36:19.260
{\an8}DON'T LIE TO ME.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.138
{\an8}- NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.431
{\an8}- YEAH, NO, NO.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.682
{\an8}I DIDN'T. I GOT OUT.
I GOT OUT.

36:24.765 --> 36:25.766
{\an8}WHATEVER.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.476
{\an8}- NO.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.603
{\an8}- ME AND SAM WERE VIBING
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

36:28.686 --> 36:30.438
{\an8}BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU NEVER KNOW WITH PEOPLE.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.272
{\an8}YOU'RE GETTING TO KNOW
EVERYBODY, SO...

36:31.355 --> 36:33.399
{\an8}IT'S REALLY NO SWEAT
OFF MY BACK.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.650
{\an8}I COULD PRETTY MUCH HAVE
MY CHOICE OF PRETTY MUCH

36:34.734 --> 36:35.651

36:35.735 --> 36:36.777
{\an8}DON'T HATE THE PLAYER.
HATE THE GAME, BABY.

36:36.861 --> 36:41.699
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED TO SNICKERS?

36:41.782 --> 36:44.160
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

BUT I HAVE TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.128

{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

37:03.846 --> 37:04.388
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO LEAVE.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.350
- YOU'RE LEAVING WHERE?

37:07.433 --> 37:08.559
- TO COME HOME.

37:08.643 --> 37:13.648
BECAUSE, UM, BASICALLY,

{\an8}- SHE'S LIKE, "AH, YEAH,
I THINK I'M GONNA LEAVE.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.217
{\an8}I THINK I'M GONNA GO HOME."

37:41.300 --> 37:42.468
