00:07.674 --> 00:09.642
- What's up, guys? Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

00:09.709 --> 00:11.378
We've got a big problem here
at DP.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.980
Flinching,
overacting to situations.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.248
- Totally.
- We've got two flinchers.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.651
Flincher number one
and flincher number two.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.653
- Okay, seems a little harsh.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.955
- Hashtag just saying.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.323
It is absolutely true.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.358
And I have got years
of history to prove it.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.526
- [horn blows]

00:26.593 --> 00:28.962
- [screaming]

00:29.028 --> 00:30.697
- [horn blows]
- Oh!

00:30.764 --> 00:32.031
- Your flinching
is distracting.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.867
And if I'm being honest,
it's a little bit embarrassing.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.001
- You're embarrassed
by my flinching?

00:35.068 --> 00:36.403
- I'm just saying.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.204
You know, when things
kinda happen at ya really fast!

00:38.271 --> 00:40.073
You get a little flinchy face.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.641
Anyways, we've got some things
we're gonna do

00:41.708 --> 00:42.675
to try and fix that.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.910
Ending with the final test

00:43.977 --> 00:46.679
of the no flinching
Slo-Mo Chaos Course.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.214
You guys ready?
- Ready.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.083
- We're ready.

- Dude.
- We all set?

01:15.975 --> 01:17.444
- We're set.
- Cody, you ready?

01:17.510 --> 01:18.745
- I'm ready.
- Twins?

01:18.812 --> 01:19.979
This is the baseline test

01:20.046 --> 01:21.815
to show you how much
you guys flinch.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.116
Do not move.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.418
Basically, do no react.
- Easy.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.153
- Play it cool
and keep a straight face.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.288
- Literally couldn't
be less worried.

01:28.354 --> 01:29.656
- Alright, you guys ready?
- Yep.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.592
- This is a waste of your time.
- Three, two, one.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.427
- [laughs]

01:34.494 --> 01:36.296
- Okay, that was a
pretty big reaction.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.598
- ♪

01:38.665 --> 01:40.900
- One.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.903
- I feel like that was--

01:43.970 --> 01:45.872
- A ridiculous thing to do!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.407
It was absurd.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.374
- Watch this.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.443
- Oh!

01:50.510 --> 01:51.945
- My whole face buckled.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.413
- [laughs] It did.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.949
- I gotta say, Cory had
like a two mile an hour fastball

01:56.015 --> 01:58.218
at his face,
and he goes like this...

01:58.284 --> 02:01.521
- Play me back Cory's.
I didn't see his.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.123
At least two feet of separation
between you and the ball.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.992
This is what we can't have.
- And you're going.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.495
- [moaning]

02:08.561 --> 02:09.829
Completely overacting.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.164
- You all
are missing the point.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.868
Any human would react this way
with a laser rocket

02:14.934 --> 02:15.935
coming at you.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.604
- Let's go
confident assertiveness.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.106
That is what I want you thinking
when you're standing up there

02:20.173 --> 02:22.075
getting ready to have
something blown up at ya.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.343
- Ty, I see your point.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.911
I'll be honest,
I was coming over here

02:24.978 --> 02:26.112
kinda expecting an apology.

02:26.179 --> 02:27.313
This conversation went
a different direction.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.448
- Really?

02:28.515 --> 02:30.583
- But, you know, I do agree
that there was

02:30.650 --> 02:32.819
some big flinching that occurred
before and during.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.153
- Apology accepted.

02:34.220 --> 02:37.056
- What? You wanted me to--
- For making the face.

02:37.123 --> 02:39.692
- That's a joke, right? If I
kick that ball as hard as

02:39.759 --> 02:41.828
I physically can at you, you're
reacting way more than that.

02:41.895 --> 02:42.996
- Absolutely not.
- Way more.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.898
- No. Let's prove it.
Round two, here we go.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.966
- Great. I like this.
- I'm not flinching.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.501
I'm not flinching.
- I probably might.

02:48.568 --> 02:51.070
- Okay, that's--that's not
the confidence we're looking for

02:51.137 --> 02:52.539
right off the bat.
- Hard to say.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.240
- Hey, Ty, you might checking
my facial expression?

02:54.307 --> 02:56.910
- Yeah.
- Assertive confidence?

02:56.976 --> 02:57.810
- Very nice.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.780
Nicely done.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.948
A little too stern.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.284
You look aggravated.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.718
Mm, now you look
a little surprised.

03:05.785 --> 03:07.687
- Oh.

03:07.754 --> 03:08.788
- Complacent.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.590
- I can't find a middle ground.
- I know.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.025
You're struggling right now.
That's okay.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.059
- Here we go.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.696
In three, two, one.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.865
- Oh, wow, you guys
gotta come check this out.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.400
- You look like you wanna--

03:20.466 --> 03:23.169
- [laughs] Oh gosh,
you're terrifying.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.672
- Let's run this forward
a little bit, see what happens.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.540
What do you see right here?

03:27.607 --> 03:30.743
- I see a guy who got kicked
by his friend earlier, okay?

03:30.810 --> 03:32.145
That's what I see.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.547
- Okay. Bottom line,
this is the goal, okay?

03:34.614 --> 03:36.182
Assertive confidence.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.318
I think we've identified
any issues that we have.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.953
Now we just gotta improve.
- I love it.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.154
- Onward!

03:41.220 --> 03:43.756
- Twins, I've got an idea
to fix your faces.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.077

04:04.143 --> 04:07.447
{\an8}- I am Lee, and I'm gonna
be your teacher today.

04:07.513 --> 04:11.284
- So, got a text from Ty
last night, and it said,

04:11.351 --> 04:15.088
"Hey, guys. I have set up
for you a consultation

04:15.154 --> 04:18.491
"to help fix your terrible
facial expressions.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.426
You're welcome."

04:20.493 --> 04:23.696
So, Lee, what I've been told is
that the problem area for

04:23.763 --> 04:26.966
this action shot is right here
and more or less right here.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.835
- Your facial expressions,
everything about

04:28.901 --> 04:31.671
your physical being,
reflects your inner nature.

04:31.738 --> 04:36.976
- Is it that our inner nature is
causing our facial expressions?

04:37.043 --> 04:38.111
- Exactly.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.812
So if you'll notice,
I've got this.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.114
It's called mala beads.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.116
I'll take this,
and I'll do an affirmation.

04:43.182 --> 04:46.319
And your mind now
will demonstrate on your face.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.687
- Lee, I'm gonna
shoot you straight.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.856
I feel like this is
a little weird.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.190
But let's do it.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.659
- Let's get weird.

04:52.725 --> 04:53.860
- You've got it.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.663
The key to an affirmation
is the words, "I am."

04:56.729 --> 04:59.232
When you always say
the affirmation now.

04:59.298 --> 05:02.368
It's never, "I will be,"
or "in the future."

05:02.435 --> 05:05.371
It's always, "I am perfect now."

05:05.438 --> 05:07.674
- I need your help
understanding

05:07.740 --> 05:09.676
how this is gonna fix...

05:09.742 --> 05:11.944
- When you feed your mind
specific thoughts,

05:12.011 --> 05:13.579
you reclaim your power.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.381
- Can I get an example
of an affirmation?

05:15.448 --> 05:19.185
- I am calm, peaceful,
and self-assured.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.153
- That's deep.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.722
- I am a winner.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.057
- Yes.

05:24.123 --> 05:27.727
- I have not yet won,
but I am a winner.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.262
- No.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.596
You had a negative in there.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.966
The mind did not hear
the positive, it heard the not.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.135
- He is trying not to lie.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.905
- I am the superior
ping pong player.

05:38.971 --> 05:43.142
- I am...a great
ping pong player.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.445
- That seemed like
a step backwards.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.080
- Did you see how
I paused though?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.614
I was gonna say something
really negative.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.650
And instead I said
something affirmative.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.485
- Can you feel that
going through your body?

05:52.552 --> 05:54.887
Can you feel how positive your
body feels when you say that?

05:54.954 --> 05:59.759
- Who would you say looks
more assertive and confident?

05:59.826 --> 06:00.960
- In my opinion, Coby.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.095
- That's not true.

06:02.161 --> 06:03.996
- You've got a transformation
going on.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.398
I think you guys have got it.

06:05.465 --> 06:06.499
- [whispers] I have it.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.000
- [whispers]
I don't think I have it.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.335
- You do.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.637
- You just gotta tap into it.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.240
- This is a pivotal moment
in my life.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.935

08:56.002 --> 08:58.237
Feel like I forgot
everything Lee taught me.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.839
- Are you kidding me?
- I don't know.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.941
- Dude, I'm the opposite.
I felt like I killed that.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.843
- Well, that was everything
I hoped it would be.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.012
I think we go check the footage
and see which twin

09:06.078 --> 09:07.246
was the flinchiest.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.215
'Cause they've got
a heck of a cleanup job to do.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.449

time to shower off?

right off the bat.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.548
Cor pulled it together.

I gotta say, everybody handled
themselves pretty good

09:44.483 --> 09:45.952
on the rocks, except Cods.

Cods did the worst.

- Cods, you're not on the fast
track to success right now.

You need a twin
to absolutely collapse.

10:13.145 --> 10:16.082
And I'm gonna make a bet, it's
not gonna be this guy over here.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.184
You gotta count on Cory
to absolutely lose his minds.

Cody's shoulder
stuck to his cheek.

You absolutely lose it
right there, Cods.

was probably a bad decision.

cancel my weekend plans.

to be a karate black belt.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.099
The problem is, he dropped out
of his training in third grade.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.635
Coby and I are here to give him
a shot at redemption.

{\an8}- Mr. Cody, how're you doing?
What's your experience level?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.616
- Um, I came for one day
of karate class,

12:30.683 --> 12:32.351
and they did
the like jump kick thing.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.719
Couldn't do it, so I quit.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.721
Now I'm back, and I'm ready
to get that black belt

12:35.788 --> 12:37.790
like she has.
- Okay.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.825
- I've grown up,
I've learned a lot, and I think

12:39.892 --> 12:41.660
I've got what it takes
to get a black belt.

12:41.727 --> 12:42.962
We're gonna see if Master Rick

12:43.028 --> 12:44.563
can help me achieve
my goal here today.

12:44.630 --> 12:45.764
Which is a black belt.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.868
Starting at a white belt.
Seems easy.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.504
- So the first thing we wanna
try to teach you how to do

12:51.570 --> 12:53.105
is how to do a jump
front snap kick.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.940
So we chamber our knee
and then we balance.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.343
Okay, if you start to lose it,
try to keep your stomach tight.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.778
- I don't have a tight stomach.
- --to your hand.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.347
- Are you ready?
- I think so.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.381
- You ready?
- Nope.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.683
- You ready? You ready?

13:04.750 --> 13:08.554
I'm just messing with you.
Ready, go.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.055
- You missed.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.258
- You may wanna kick
the pad and not my arm.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.659
Don't hold your breath.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.895
- I seriously think I might
have pulled a hamstring on that.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.730
- [laughs] I could tell.
- That was an overextension.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.431
- Okay, let's do this.

13:19.498 --> 13:22.768
So step back, tap your knee
down, throw your kick.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.003
- Cody, you're way behind.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.371
- Two.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.772

we get too far here,

13:31.610 --> 13:33.445

to the black belt?

need to be able to perform

13:37.816 --> 13:39.251
to earn your black belt.
That sound good?

13:39.318 --> 13:41.487
- Yep. Yes, sir.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.721
Oh, wow.

- No, sir. Okay, so what
we're gonna work on doing

14:15.688 --> 14:17.156

14:17.223 --> 14:19.558
She's gonna single leg him, take
him down, put him in the mount.

multiple attackers at one time.
