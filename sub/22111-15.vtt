WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.807
ERIC: Maybe Lieutenant
Naomi Elder was staying

00:06.840 --> 00:07.775
with Keith and Lynn Stiger

00:07.808 --> 00:09.410
of Silver Lake.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.145
Uh, she wasn't here.
I didn't see her

00:11.179 --> 00:12.313
till dinnertime.

00:16.117 --> 00:16.817
Why is this happening?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.652
Thank you. I-I don't know

00:18.686 --> 00:20.721
how I'll repay you, but I will.
MOSLEY: Do we know

00:20.754 --> 00:22.523
if this is restricted
to Lieutenant Elder

00:22.556 --> 00:24.625
or if this is part
of a larger espionage ring?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.094
CALLEN:
This isn't over for us.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.395
We follow up on every case

00:27.428 --> 00:28.662
and every lead.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.663
Granger, I want out.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.332
GRANGER:
I'll protect you.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.501
I'll help you cut ties
with the North Koreans

00:33.534 --> 00:35.769
and I'll work with Justice
on your incarceration.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.375
*

00:54.588 --> 00:57.358
CALLEN: No sign
of Keith Stiger.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.428
Place looks empty.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.196
Warrant's in.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.132
We're good to go.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
SAM :
I'm on the cabin.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.183
Nothing here.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.584
CALLEN :
Looks empty. Moving.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.448
*

01:57.718 --> 01:59.553
CALLEN:
Camera.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.891
It's a cell phone trigger. Bomb!

02:23.544 --> 02:25.379
You dropped something.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.147
Thank you.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.285
*

02:49.437 --> 02:52.306
*

02:53.341 --> 02:54.942
Hello.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.610
Operations Manager Lange.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.746
I'm Special Agent Harley Hidoko.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.349
I know who you are, Ms. Hidoko.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.650
Please, don't let me

03:02.683 --> 03:04.585
interrupt you.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.587
It's refreshing

03:06.620 --> 03:08.556
to see someone take such pride
in the care

03:08.589 --> 03:09.557
of their weapon.

03:09.590 --> 03:13.494
Preventative maintenance
is kind of like my yoga.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.997
My yoga generally
comes in the form

03:17.030 --> 03:21.235
of a nice single malt
these days.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.304
How are you liking

03:23.337 --> 03:24.738
your new duty station?

03:24.772 --> 03:27.308
Los Angeles is great.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.676
It's just...

03:28.709 --> 03:31.412
It's a lot bigger
than I was expecting.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.681
It's...

03:33.714 --> 03:35.849
I don't know.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.486
It's a hard city
to make your own.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.520
Yes.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.856
You're from, um... Baltimore,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.258
and that's very different.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.026
You read my file.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.595
Your accomplishments

03:47.628 --> 03:49.430
within the female
engagement teams

03:49.463 --> 03:50.631
is excellent.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.266
Thank you.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.604
Are you coming back
to work today?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.706
Oh, we were having...

03:58.739 --> 04:00.841
such a nice conversation

04:00.874 --> 04:02.576
until you brought up

04:02.610 --> 04:05.713
my uncertain
employment situation.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.648
Understood.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.683
I'm sorry, ma'am.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.052
In Baltimore,
you had friends and family,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.855
and in Los Angeles, you have...?

04:14.888 --> 04:18.792
I bought a ficus
at the farmers market.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.661
Aha. Well, then,

04:20.694 --> 04:22.796
you have a ficus and me.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.901
I did read your
file, Ms. Hidoko,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.904
and I am so sorry for your loss.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.906
Your husband

04:32.940 --> 04:36.076
was a true hero.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.846
Yes, he was.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.887
I'm needed up in Ops.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.656
Ah, go.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.491
Thank you.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.693
Go, go.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.098
Hello, all.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.733
Good morning.
I hear that

04:59.767 --> 05:02.336
that Sam and Callen
got an early start.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.371
That they did.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.672
They're at
the crime scene now.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.640
MOSLEY: And this is
related to the murder

05:06.674 --> 05:08.542
of Lieutenant Naomi Elder,
correct?

05:08.576 --> 05:10.644
Yes. The fishing cottage

05:10.678 --> 05:12.780
was jointly owned
by two different corporations.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.015
Both had ties to Keith Stiger.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.650
HIDOKO: They were
the husband and wife

05:16.684 --> 05:18.352
that the lieutenant was staying
with when she was murdered.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.453
NELL: Yep,
that's them.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.721
KENSI:
Callen and Sam

05:20.754 --> 05:21.789
interviewed Keith Stiger.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.557
He checked out, but they got
an odd feeling from him.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.758
They think he might
have something to do

05:24.792 --> 05:25.726
with the lieutenant's murder.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.760
So they're looking into the case

05:26.794 --> 05:27.628
outside
of their scheduled hours.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.097
Well, I like that.
I thought you might.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.665
NELL: Well, it seems
their hunch was correct.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.101
LAFD found Lynn Stiger's body

05:34.134 --> 05:36.604
shoved in a closet
in this house.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.939
Prelim report shows she was
dead even before the explosion

05:38.972 --> 05:40.441
courtesy of two gunshot wounds

05:40.474 --> 05:41.775
to the chest.
DEEKS:
Yikes.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.977
So she was shot
and then blown up.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.481
I mean,
seems like a tad overkill.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.484
Overkilling the...
Yeah.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.019
You get it
Fair enough. Moving on.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.654
HIDOKO: So, are
we thinking

05:53.687 --> 05:54.988
that Keith Stiger
killed Lieutenant Elder?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.857
Or he hired the shooter who did.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.592
MOSLEY: Right now
the focus has to be the murder

05:58.626 --> 06:00.027
of Lynn Stiger, which includes

06:00.060 --> 06:02.663
bringing in Keith Stiger
for questioning.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.798
So, if Stiger killed
Lieutenant Elder and his wife,

06:04.832 --> 06:07.401
he must have known eventually
we'd find that fishing cottage,

06:07.435 --> 06:08.736
which means

06:08.769 --> 06:10.804
that bomb was rigged
to take us out.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.805
Yes, it was.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.408
NELL: Well,
we've traced

06:14.442 --> 06:15.876
another concealed
real estate holding

06:15.909 --> 06:17.411
to Keith Stiger.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.780
This time, it's a
warehouse downtown.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.881
You two go.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.616
I'll have Sam and Callen
meet you there.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.617
On it.
Okay.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.685
And be careful,

06:24.718 --> 06:25.853
because you may be
walking into

06:25.886 --> 06:26.854
a similar situation.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.822
Fantastic.
Okay.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.963
Of all the alleys in all
the towns in all the world,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.798
you come wandering into mine.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.600
What do we got?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.068
No movement in or out
of the warehouse,

06:41.101 --> 06:42.770
Mosley got us
our emergency warrant,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.805
and your instincts were right
about Keith Stiger.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.840
Yeah, but it took
finding his wife's body

06:46.874 --> 06:47.775
to prove
he was hiding something.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.942
Yeah, but hiding what?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.444
Like, what's his endgame here?

06:50.478 --> 06:51.945
Lieutenant Elder's
murder was planned.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.647
Hired shooters, the
whole nine yards.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.149
The fishing shack was
professionally rigged,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.951
but Stiger's, like,
a high finance guy.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.152
This just doesn't add up.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.854
It's all part of
an exit strategy.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.790
The warehouse,
the place by the pond,

07:02.823 --> 07:03.691
killing his wife--

07:03.724 --> 07:05.559
this was all planned
years in advance,

07:05.593 --> 07:07.628
and it's looking
like the lieutenant's murder is

07:07.661 --> 07:08.629
what set things in motion.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.497
Let's find out why

07:09.530 --> 07:10.898
he wanted
to kill Lieutenant Elder.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.866
No visible windows
on the ground floor,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.835
only up top, so we're blind.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.104
What do you think about
throwing the long ball, huh?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.240
Easy money.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.809
We'll see.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.844
Let's go.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.784
That's the only opening,
and it's not big.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.553
SAM:
Yeah?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.855
Cover me.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.695
I have to say,
I had my doubts.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.731
It's okay to be impressed.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.033
CALLEN:
What are we looking at, Kens?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.801
I don't see any movement.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.870
It looks empty.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.207
I don't see any bomb wiring
around the door, either.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.943
Ready?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.011
Let's move in.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.665
Clear.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.166
Clear.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.268
Clear.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.103
CALLEN:
Clear.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.244
KENSI:
What do you got?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.046
Oh.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.848
Ammonium nitrate.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.149
KENSI: That's what
McVeigh used

08:36.183 --> 08:37.918
in Oklahoma City.
Yeah.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.688
His truck was filled with 40,
50-pound bags of this stuff.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.855
DEEKS:
And look at all these pallets.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.190
I mean,
if this whole place was filled,

08:43.223 --> 08:45.092
that's a lot more than 40 bags.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.060
Now we know
what Stiger's planning.
KENSI: Yeah.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.129
A massive bombing.
After the explosion

08:49.162 --> 08:51.331
at the fishing cottage,
he knows we're onto him.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.333
He accelerated
his timeline.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.968
Except we don't know where he is

08:55.002 --> 08:56.870
or what his target is.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.852
What do we have, Eric?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.954
ERIC: Still nothing
on Keith Stiger's location.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.923
NELL: Yeah, we sent a team
to his office.

09:15.956 --> 09:16.957
Of course, he wasn't there,

09:16.990 --> 09:19.092
but they're bringing in
his two business partners

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
to the boatshed
for questioning.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.896
All right, Kensi and Deeks
will meet them there.
Copy that.

09:22.930 --> 09:23.731
All right, it looks
like there's a network

09:23.764 --> 09:24.898
of surveillance
cameras in the area.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.068
Might show how Stiger moved
all this ammonium nitrate.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.837
Yeah, I tried to tap into them.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.972
Must be a closed circuit
system down there.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.808
The feeds would be recorded
at a central on-site location.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.710
Hmm.
CALLEN:
You have any idea

09:36.744 --> 09:38.812
where that'd be located?

09:38.846 --> 09:40.614
All right, I got a
security office listed

09:40.648 --> 09:41.882
for the building
across from you.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.751
Southeast corner.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.001
So, you have no record

10:01.034 --> 10:03.403
of that name being registered

10:03.436 --> 10:05.739
at any schools
in the area?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.407
Okay. Um...

10:07.440 --> 10:09.977
I'm sorry. You know,
I'm gonna have

10:10.010 --> 10:11.879
to call you back.
Yeah.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.313
Thank you.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.383
Well, Henrietta.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.785
Shay Mosley.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.120
You've sure moved up
in the world.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.755
Well, I'm just grateful

10:21.789 --> 10:24.692
for the opportunity
I've been given.
No.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.994
I meant literally.
You have come up

10:27.027 --> 10:29.863
directly over my office.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.298
Ah.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.001
The construction hasn't altered
your space, has it?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.302
The construction, no.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.937
Your stilettos.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.872
Oh, they must be drilling

10:38.906 --> 10:40.373
a hole in your head.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.809
I'll be sure

10:41.842 --> 10:43.343
to have another rug brought up.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.878
Please, Henrietta, have a seat.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.180
Thank you.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.084
It appears that this man,

10:51.118 --> 10:52.185
Keith Stiger,

10:52.219 --> 10:53.353
has enough ammonium nitrate

10:53.386 --> 10:55.889
to take down several
large buildings.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.025
It's a huge load
to move about the city.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.160
Finding out
how they transported it

11:00.193 --> 11:01.862
is certainly the key.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.897
Indeed.
Anyway,

11:03.931 --> 11:06.266
I came to welcome you.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.001
Well, thank you.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.970
How do you like my team?

11:10.003 --> 11:13.040
I find them extremely loyal.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.174
To you.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.175
Mmm.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.377
Hetty, I'd like
to speak with you

11:17.410 --> 11:19.112
about your role here.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.281
Is it okay if I call you Hetty?

11:21.314 --> 11:23.951
Yes.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.920
I am the Executive
Assistant Director, Pacific,

11:26.954 --> 11:31.391
and I was given the task to run
this office in your absence.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.393
You are the operations manager,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.095
which means you work for me.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.231
Well...
I-I am.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.232
I do.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.734
I just want
to be sure

11:40.768 --> 11:43.771
that we're not stepping
on each other's toes.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.039
We must define
our roles.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.009
And although there may be
some redundancy,

11:49.042 --> 11:52.079
you have to know,
I mean no disrespect.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.480
Yes, you do.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.748
Just...

11:54.782 --> 11:55.749
a little.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.852
To answer
your question,

11:58.886 --> 12:01.488
I-I don't know
what my role is going forward.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.958
Well, would you like me
to help you get clarification

12:04.992 --> 12:07.027
from the director or SECNAV?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.361
No, thank you.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.198
I've already spoken to SECNAV.
You have?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.000
Yes.
Huh.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.968
And what did she say?

12:15.002 --> 12:17.070
Oh, well, um,

12:17.104 --> 12:19.006
she expressed
her sympathy

12:19.039 --> 12:22.142
to my recent hardships
in Vietnam.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.376
As do I.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.481
Well...

12:28.515 --> 12:30.017
welcome.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.084
Thank you.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.987
Oh, and...

12:34.021 --> 12:36.423
do bring up another rug.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.126
Yes, ma'am.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.065
Thanks for showing us the
surveillance room, Rocky.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.033
Not a problem.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.968
And maybe stop calling it
a surveillance room.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.103
Best to set
proper expectations.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.139
It's more like a closet
with some old-school recorders.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.809
Not VHS, but not
of this decade either, you know?

12:55.843 --> 12:57.010
Mmm.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.245
Hard

12:58.278 --> 12:59.546
Bacon?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.148
I'm good,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.050
but I think my friend Sam
will probably take advantage

13:03.083 --> 13:05.152
of this mobile
brunch.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.519
I'm good.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
Okay. But keto
will change your life.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.190
Keto.
Please don't ask.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.258
What is keto?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.592
Ketogenic diet.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.261
I basically eat fat all day,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.029
and the pounds just drip off.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.032
I can eat what I want,
whenever I want.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.033
In-N-Out Double-Doubles
with extra cheese

13:20.067 --> 13:21.434
twice a day?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.336
Yes, please. Just hold the bun.
CALLEN: Come on.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.138
Eh, that's not
exactly how it works.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.841
It kinda is.
It really isn't.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.609
You need discipline
and consisten...

13:29.642 --> 13:31.211
Nah, not really.
It's pretty easy.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.913
Mm. Sounds
like the kind of diet

13:32.946 --> 13:34.447
I could get behind.
How long does it take to work?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.515
Right away.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.051
Couple of days and
the LBs just start falling away.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.187
Mm. How long you been
on the diet, Rocky?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.855
About two years.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.924
Here we are.
Uh...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.192
Can you hold that for me?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.894
Thanks.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.295
All right.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.302
Oh.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.404
Thanks. Here we are,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.172
at either the world's most
low-tech surveillance room

13:59.206 --> 14:01.374
or the world's
most high-tech closet.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.609
Looks like
all the feeds

14:02.642 --> 14:04.111
are labeled by address.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.412
Yeah. Makes it easy.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.413
Okay, well,
we're looking

14:06.446 --> 14:09.549
for the security feeds
from, uh, buildings 1992

14:09.582 --> 14:10.550
and 2110.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.153
1992 and 2110.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.089
Right down here.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.091
The recorders are gone.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.127
Any idea
where they might be?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.162
They must have been stolen.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.666
Well, do you have
cameras in this room?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.335
No.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.137
We should look into that.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.212
CASTOR:
Hey, guys,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.348
this is Barbara Silva
and Patrick Griffin.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.283
They're Keith Stiger's
business partners.
Thanks.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.117
Good to see you,
brother.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.452
Hi, I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.987
My partner,
Detective Deeks.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.688
Hi. How are you?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.024
Special Agent Castor said
that you have some questions

14:51.058 --> 14:52.025
about Keith?
Yes, we do.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.026
GRIFFIN:
That's good,

14:53.060 --> 14:54.161
because we've been worried.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.129
We haven't heard
from him in two days.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.330
Is it rare for him
to be out of contact

14:57.364 --> 14:58.966
for a couple of days
like this?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.300
Very.
We're a private equity firm

15:00.333 --> 15:01.334
and we work
with strong companies

15:01.368 --> 15:03.336
in the middle market
economy.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.472
It's a constant contact
kind of business.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.207
I mean, the three
of us are usually

15:07.240 --> 15:09.977
e-mailing and texting straight
through Christmas, birthdays.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.245
Do you know where Keith is?

15:12.279 --> 15:13.180
That's actually what
we need your help with.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.282
Uh, any friends he
might be staying with?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.284
No, he was very much focused
on his family.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.285
And work.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.186
What about local getaways?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.288
Any hotels in the area
he likes to stay at?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.957
Keith's not into the
whole staycation thing.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.226
Nah, me neither. I get time off,
I'm heading straight to Hawaii.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.227
Uh, you mentioned family.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.062
Does he have family
that lives in the area?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.331
No, just Lynn, his wife.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.400
I assume you've
already spoken with her.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

15:35.635 --> 15:38.005
but, uh, Lynn was murdered.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.739
Her body was found
this morning.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.075
Oh, my.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.376
Keith must be going crazy.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.078
He was so in love
with her.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.081
Every time he looked at her,
you could just tell, you know?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.350
Mmm. I do.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.285
You don't think
Keith's in danger, do you?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.121
Could the person that
did this to Lynn...

15:54.154 --> 15:56.123
We don't know yet.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.657
Oh, man.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.027
Keith's parents-- do
you know where they live?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.328
Uh, they died when
he was very young.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.330
Keith was raised
by a wonderful couple,

16:03.363 --> 16:06.233
the Harrells. They'd been
good friends of his parents.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.201
Do you know how
we could contact the Harrells?

16:08.235 --> 16:10.237
I don't know
where they live.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.072
Out of state,
I think.
GRIFFIN: Yeah.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.075
But I might have
their number in my phone.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.209
That'd be great. Thank you.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.577
CALLEN:
Still no word

16:17.610 --> 16:19.179
on how Stiger got all
that ammonium nitrate

16:19.212 --> 16:20.113
in and out of
the warehouse?

16:20.147 --> 16:23.116
No, but the NCIS
forensic team contacted us.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.451
They found major amounts

16:24.484 --> 16:26.253
of residue
from two different chemicals

16:26.286 --> 16:28.388
from the Stiger facility.
They were...

16:28.421 --> 16:30.557
Nitromethane and Tovex.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.824
Yeah.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.561
: Look who always
has to be the smart one.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.496
What was that?

16:36.529 --> 16:37.364
What?
What?

16:37.397 --> 16:39.232
Oh, I-I just said...
You said something?

16:39.266 --> 16:41.301
Yeah. I said, uh, "Book

16:41.334 --> 16:44.604
new always has to bleed
the smart bun."

16:44.637 --> 16:47.240
NELL: Okay, uh,
ammonium nitrate,

16:47.274 --> 16:48.441
nitromethane,
and Tovex.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.442
That is
the same cocktail

16:49.476 --> 16:50.777
as Oklahoma City.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.546
So, Sam, you were right
about Stiger's plan.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.349
Yeah. But if that warehouse
was filled with this stuff...

16:56.383 --> 16:58.551
It'd be OKC times five.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.687
Huh, this is interesting.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.622
It's in relation
to the Harrells.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.624
The couple
that cared for Keith Stiger

17:04.657 --> 17:05.825
after his parents passed away.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.694
We have a location on them?
No, not yet,

17:07.727 --> 17:09.296
but it looks
like they purchased

17:09.329 --> 17:11.498
a house three years ago,
and it was paid for

17:11.531 --> 17:14.634
by a corporation called
Oxnard Seaside Ventures.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.238
Interesting, because
that is the same corporation

17:18.271 --> 17:20.073
that purchased
the airline tickets Jennifer Kim

17:20.107 --> 17:21.374
flew into the United States on.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.442
SAM:
Hmm, Jennifer Kim.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.311
That tiny female

17:24.344 --> 17:27.380
North Korean spy
who kicked Callen's ass?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.249
That never gets old for you,
does it?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.383
No.
Hmm.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.419
All right, so Stiger
was either a spy

17:32.452 --> 17:35.322
or he was somehow working
with the North Koreans.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.224
Well, if he was a spy,
they were playing the long game.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.326
Real long.
North Koreans placed Stiger

17:39.359 --> 17:41.528
with the Harrells
when he was just a kid.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.629
Well, there was always rumors
that the North Koreans

17:42.662 --> 17:46.233
were using captured American
soldiers to breed spies.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.134
Lieutenant Elder must have seen
something suspicious

17:47.167 --> 17:49.102
when she was staying
with the Stigers.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.338
Figured out
that Keith was a spy.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.740
SAM: Jennifer Kim would know
how Stiger was trained,

17:53.773 --> 17:55.542
who his alliances are
in the States.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.377
Where is she now?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.711
Well, she made a deal
with the intelligence community

17:58.745 --> 17:59.846
to work as an asset.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.281
And Granger set her up

18:01.314 --> 18:02.582
in a remote location.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.784
We need to get to her fast.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.852
Yes, we do.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.887
Stiger is mobile,
and he has everything he needs

18:07.920 --> 18:10.590
to carry out a major attack
on Los Angeles.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.601
Talk to me, meerkats.
What do we got?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.736
Well, since there's
no surveillance footage

18:23.770 --> 18:26.739
in the immediate area
surrounding Stiger's warehouse,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.741
we've expanded
our search radius.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.577
ERIC:
Searching only for vehicles
that could carry the weight

18:30.610 --> 18:32.545
of the ammonium nitrate.
Now, there are

18:32.579 --> 18:34.281
lots of trucks
down there, but this one

18:34.314 --> 18:36.449
has counterfeit plates on it.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.685
And it was about a half mile out
from the warehouse.
KENSI: Great.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.220
How do we know that it's
carrying the chemicals?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.554
The potholes told us.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.556
I'm sorry, what?
Keep talking.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.693
The truck is traveling
at around 25 miles per hour

18:46.726 --> 18:48.361
when it went
over these potholes.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.297
You can see by the way
the trailer's moving

18:50.330 --> 18:52.499
the truck is loaded down
to max capacity.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.667
So it's worst-case scenario
confirmed.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.668
Yeah.
If this truck

18:55.702 --> 18:57.537
is loaded to capacity
with ammonium nitrate,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.539
nitromethane
and Tovex,

18:59.572 --> 19:02.775
it could decimate several
high-rise buildings downtown.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.277
Where's the truck now?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.545
We tracked it to
the Little Tokyo area,

19:05.578 --> 19:06.613
but then we lost it.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.581
All right,
we're heading down there now.
Okay.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.749
We'll continue
the search from here.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.428
First they
give me Wi-Fi

19:21.461 --> 19:23.230
and now I get
real human visitors?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.564
An embarrassment of riches.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.567
What about your friends
in the intelligence community?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.569
No personality.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.571
I tried to make friends,
but they aren't having it.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.706
I take it the rural life
isn't your thing.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.908
It shouldn't be anyone's thing.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.611
Human beings started out in
places like this, but then they

19:38.645 --> 19:40.280
became smarter and built things,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.415
like restaurants,
malls and theaters.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.451
Well, nothing says innovation
like a good mall.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.787
So, what brings
you two out here?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.757
My next interrogation
isn't until Monday.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.791
We need your help.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.493
That's what I'm here for.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.295
That's what's keeping me
from being locked away

19:55.328 --> 19:56.763
in federal prison.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.331
SAM:
Mm.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.733
Do you know this man?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.602
No.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.870
His name is Keith Stiger.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.639
We believe he is
a North Korean spy.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.907
And you thought to yourself,

20:07.940 --> 20:10.543
"Hey, I know
another North Korean spy."

20:10.577 --> 20:13.646
How long has he
been in America?

20:13.680 --> 20:14.847
Since he was a child.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.484
He looks half Korean,
half Caucasian.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.786
The plan would've been
to raise him in the States,

20:19.819 --> 20:21.988
but with allegiances and
ties back to North Korea.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.256
He's basically American.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.024
Doesn't have to fake it
like I did.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.294
Well, it's looking
like he's planning a bombing

20:27.327 --> 20:28.795
here in Los Angeles.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.297
Any idea
where we could find him?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.898
How long has it been
since he ditched his cover

20:31.931 --> 20:33.032
and went underground?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.835
We found his wife's body
this morning.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.305
Coroner says she's been dead
a couple of days.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.573
He killed his wife?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.676
He was activated.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.345
Whatever he's planning
is the culmination

20:45.378 --> 20:46.546
of his entire mission.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.516
And by "mission," you mean,
basically, his entire life.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.718
Yeah. He'll be highly motivated
to succeed,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.520
and they'll give him every asset
at their disposal

20:53.553 --> 20:55.322
to help him.
Then where do we go to find him?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.724
There's a network of people in
L.A. that are in place to help

20:57.757 --> 21:00.593
an embedded spy when
something like this happens.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.896
But I'm gonna need something
from you guys first.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.967
Something more
than no federal prison time

21:08.000 --> 21:10.670
and a beautiful house
of your own?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.271
Pizza.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.307
A good,

21:14.341 --> 21:15.708
New York-style slice.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.044
They bring me groceries,
but I don't cook.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.447
And cold cereal
has grown really tired.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.749
Ah.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.724
Nell, we're here.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.493
NELL: So, the truck turned down
that street earlier today,

21:33.526 --> 21:34.727
but then nothing.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.830
And I'm not picking it up on any
of the surrounding streets.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.800
So, guys, it's got to still be
in that area.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.335
All right,
we'll check it out.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.404
Well, at least we're looking
for a giant semitruck

21:44.437 --> 21:45.872
of a needle
in a giant haystack.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.740
As opposed to a Prius
on the Westside?

21:47.774 --> 21:48.941
Exactly.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.843
You think
Jennifer Kim's gonna help us?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.545
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.080
She was raised from a young age
to harm the U.S.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.015
What makes you think
she's gonna help our team now?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.717
Well, 'cause it's not
really about her.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.752
I mean, Granger trusted her.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.821
I trust Granger;
therefore, through proxy,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.524
or transitive property,
I'm on Team Jennifer Kim.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.858
Or Team Jen Kim, you know,
'cause it sounds better.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.427
You can put it
on a T-shirt.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.830
Granger really stuck his neck
out for her, didn't he?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.665
It seems to me that
brokering that deal

22:12.699 --> 22:14.367
with the Justice Department
and the State Department

22:14.401 --> 22:16.102
was pretty much his primary
focus right until, uh,

22:16.135 --> 22:18.471
you know.
Yeah.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.772
Anyway,

22:19.806 --> 22:22.074
if she double-crosses us,
she disrespects him.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.111
If she does that,
I'll take her out myself.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.779
Fair enough.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.415
All right, well,
we're not seeing

22:28.448 --> 22:30.016
Stiger's massive
mobile bomb anywhere.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.384
Yeah, but it's
gonna be here.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.852
We're gonna find it.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.946
* Take the train big rush
* Big rush *

22:59.979 --> 23:01.881
* Wind tunnel, everybody
on the bus *

23:01.914 --> 23:03.182
* On the bus...

23:06.453 --> 23:08.087
What you doing here?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.556
I thought you were arrested.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.858
They had no idea who I was.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.126
Thought I was just another
American criminal.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.828
I was released a week ago.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.864
Hey, were you followed?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.031
No.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.801
No. I just...

23:21.834 --> 23:25.104
need some cash and a clean gun.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.573
Oh.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.041
You know I need to call in
for verification.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.610
I'm sure you understand.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.745
I understand that you

23:32.779 --> 23:34.814
have never done
any of the things

23:34.847 --> 23:36.015
that I've done
for our country.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.951
I understand
that you sit here

23:38.985 --> 23:40.687
playing video games,
handing guns and money

23:40.720 --> 23:41.854
to people that
aren't like you.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.557
People that aren't weak

23:44.591 --> 23:47.827
and lazy and scared.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.108
All right, look.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.610
I'll give you the gun
and the cash,

24:03.643 --> 24:04.977
but what are you even
doing here?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.479
When you were arrested,

24:06.513 --> 24:08.014
you were the last asset.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.716
You were a target.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.150
Didn't you think we were still
under orders to kill you?

24:11.183 --> 24:13.786
I gambled. I'm tapped out.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.522
I need that cash and gun.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.856
Besides, I knew that if
you tried to take me out,

24:16.889 --> 24:17.924
I could kill you.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.963
That's fair, I guess.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.932
Last person I heard was
killed was Aaron Kim.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.501
Any other clean up
teams been sent?

24:28.535 --> 24:32.204
No. No, look,
you gambled correctly.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.107
Your name hasn't come up
as a target, not once.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.010
Any of the newer assets
still in play?

24:40.012 --> 24:42.949
Uh, yeah.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.552
Anyone gone under?

24:45.585 --> 24:48.020
Man, I got to
call this in.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.290
Shh.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.560
Where is Keith Stiger?

24:53.593 --> 24:54.994
I don't know.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.062
He's gone under,
so it's your job

24:56.095 --> 24:57.664
to know where he is.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.632
Look, my bodyguard's
gonna be back here any...

24:59.666 --> 25:02.068
I only need three
seconds to kill you.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.537
All right, look.
Stiger's in L.A.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.938
He's planning something big.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.239
Help me!
Hey!

25:10.109 --> 25:11.644
He's gonna kill you.
Shut up.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.045
Federal agents!

25:17.183 --> 25:20.219
Guys, I told you I got this.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.191
You're welcome.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.204
Man, you are lower
than pond scum.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.839
You turn your back
on your country

25:39.872 --> 25:40.973
to work with these pigs.

25:41.007 --> 25:41.908
SAM: Hey, hey.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.677
Hands to yourself.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.913
What is Keith Stiger
planning?
Look, I don't know.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.849
All I know is if I'm taken, they
will have me killed in jail.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.751
You know that.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.120
Jennifer, please.
Then give us something.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.055
You help us, we'll see that
you get put in solitary.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.658
Was this an assignment or
is Stiger working freelance?

25:58.691 --> 26:00.693
I'm a dead man.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.829
You might be,
but if you help us,

26:02.862 --> 26:04.597
you may buy yourself
some time in jail.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.968
All right, look,
it's not sanctioned.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.070
What he's planning
is freelance.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.705
Why do you say that?

26:12.739 --> 26:15.341
'Cause I was told to have him
killed if he surfaced.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.909
Stiger's got a
plan of his own.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.010
And he's recruited many men here
to help him.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.179
Did he have anyone fly out
to Los Angeles to help him?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.250
Who is it?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.721
Jin Woo.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.890
Through the use of facial rec,
we've been able to determine

26:30.923 --> 26:32.258
that he flew into Las Vegas

26:32.291 --> 26:35.928
from Osaka, under a
false name and passport.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.130
He then must have driven the
rest of the way to Los Angeles.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.899
Who is he?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.902
NELL:
Well, we're still trying to
put the pieces together,

26:42.935 --> 26:44.336
but it looks like he was
a member of a Korean

26:44.370 --> 26:47.940
People's Army Special Operations
Force that went rogue.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.408
Have the North Koreans tried
to bring him in for questioning?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.011
Oh, yeah,
but he's avoided capture.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.981
I was searching the area where
we last saw the semitruck,

26:55.014 --> 26:57.984
and I got a hit on a DWP
motion sensor camera

26:58.017 --> 26:59.786
near the L.A. River.
Check it out.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.156
Jin Woo.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.125
Where are these tunnels
leading to?

27:06.158 --> 27:08.360
That specific tunnel is an
out of service storm drain.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.863
Looks like it was put out of use
by the construction path

27:10.897 --> 27:12.431
of the new Metro Rail line.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.933
NELL:
Well, there it is.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.935
That tunnel allows him
to move through

27:15.968 --> 27:18.705
the entire length
of new construction.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.706
MOSLEY: Unlike the
Oklahoma City bombing,

27:19.739 --> 27:21.207
they might be planning
on detonating the bomb

27:21.240 --> 27:22.308
directly under the target.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.011
How is the construction crew
bringing their equipment

27:25.044 --> 27:26.112
into the tunnel?

27:26.145 --> 27:28.748
Um, the entrance is right
off Los Angeles Street.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.216
Right here.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.084
That could be where they're
bringing the bomb supplies

27:32.118 --> 27:33.720
into the tunnels.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.121
That's two blocks from
Kensi and Deeks' position.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.924
Get them over there,
and get me the LAPD chief

27:37.957 --> 27:39.926
on the phone right now.
ERIC: Copy that.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.902
One, two, three.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.804
We got two dead
security officers.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.773
Truck.
Yeah.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.812
One, two, three.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.227
One, two, three.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.365
That's not good.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.370
MOSLEY:
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.972
I will keep you apprised

28:26.005 --> 28:28.841
of the events
as they evolve.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.043
Ma'am, the semitruck
was empty.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.946
No explosive material
was found on site.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.147
But there are tire tracks
suggesting

28:35.181 --> 28:37.083
that they used
a Polaris utility vehicle

28:37.116 --> 28:38.818
to haul the materials
into the Metro Rail

28:38.851 --> 28:40.286
construction tunnels.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.054
Kensi and Deeks went back
for their tactical gear.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.422
LAPD SWAT is in route,
ten minutes.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.825
And how far out
are Callen and Sam?

28:45.858 --> 28:47.894
Two minutes.
And the REACT Team?

28:47.927 --> 28:48.995
They are 40 minutes out.
Okay.

28:49.028 --> 28:53.199
However this thing plays out,
it's gonna be quick.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.034
Yes.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.944
Let's go.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.351
Heads on swivels. We have
no idea how many people

29:12.384 --> 29:14.253
Stiger's got down here.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.361
SAM:
Got four fuel cans.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.963
About 20 gallons' worth.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.431
I don't know if
they're empty or not.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.133
There's got to be more
than one Polaris down here

29:27.166 --> 29:29.168
to move all these chemicals.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.946
I got two men, AR-15s.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.047
CALLEN :
Coming to you.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.112
STIGER:
Come in. Do you copy?

30:15.081 --> 30:17.083
Where are they?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.350
Find them right now.

30:18.384 --> 30:21.087
I got eyes on
Keith Stiger.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.422
Well, we got to get to 'em
before he finds those bodies.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.126
They're coming
right at us.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.427
We're gonna
have to go loud.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.331
Federal agents! Drop it!

30:44.911 --> 30:46.212
Moving.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.095
You good?

31:03.129 --> 31:04.596
Good.

31:09.101 --> 31:12.238
Keith Stiger took his motorcycle
deeper into the tunnel.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.605
There's no explosives
up to this point.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.307
They're moving it all further
down in the tunnel.

31:15.341 --> 31:16.575
We got to move.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.916
MOSLEY:
Stiger's been hauling explosives
down the tunnel all day.

31:23.950 --> 31:26.652
Do we have any idea what
his target might be?

31:26.685 --> 31:28.554
Well, that tunnel passes under
three buildings

31:28.587 --> 31:31.157
that are all over
20 stories tall.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.424
Maybe. What else?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.060
From this position,
they could blow up

31:34.093 --> 31:35.427
three or four
strategic water mains.

31:35.461 --> 31:38.097
Massive flooding
and sinkholes.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.165
Disruptive and mass chaos,

31:39.198 --> 31:40.566
but those are also
soft targets.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.369
That's the kind of
statement ISIS would value.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.503
Jin Woo and Stiger

31:44.536 --> 31:45.637
have gone rogue.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.039
I bet that
they're looking

31:47.073 --> 31:49.575
for a hard, non-civilian target.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.678
Wait. That tunnel
also goes under

31:52.711 --> 31:55.581
the 500,000 square foot
LAPD headquarters building.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.183
MOSLEY:
A symbol of authority

31:57.216 --> 31:58.184
in America, that's it.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.485
Oh, God.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.687
Get me the LAPD chief
immediately.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.655
Tell Callen where the target is.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.124
Yeah. Callen.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.260
Callen.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.129
He must be too
deep in the tunnels.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.597
We've lost comms.
Yeah.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.332
ERIC: We won't be able to
get them any information.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.666
Yeah, but that also means
that they won't be able

32:14.700 --> 32:16.202
to communicate
with each other.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.272
NELL:
Not good.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.353
NELL: Team's comms
are still unresponsive.

32:34.386 --> 32:37.023
And there's no Wi-Fi or
cell towers down there

32:37.056 --> 32:38.124
that I can hack into.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.291
What's the sitrep?

32:39.325 --> 32:40.526
NELL:
Well,

32:40.559 --> 32:42.194
the team had a visual
on Keith Stiger.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.463
No eyes on Jin Woo, yet,

32:44.496 --> 32:46.132
and we've lost all
communication with them,

32:46.165 --> 32:48.200
once they advanced
down the tunnels.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.102
And they have no idea that LAPD
headquarters is the target.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.404
Well, they know their objective

32:52.438 --> 32:54.140
and they have the training
to accomplish it,

32:54.173 --> 32:55.907
so I think we have to
leave it up to them now.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.614
I just spoke to LAPD,

33:02.648 --> 33:04.550
Homeland and FBI.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.452
They're setting up
a command center.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.454
I'm staking my reputation
on your team.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.089
As you should.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.257
You don't ever doubt them?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.758
No.

33:12.791 --> 33:13.725
Why not?

33:13.759 --> 33:15.761
Because I handpicked

33:15.794 --> 33:17.696
each and every one of them.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.732
Well, if that's the proven
playbook, then my decision

33:20.766 --> 33:23.369
about what to do
with this team may have just

33:23.402 --> 33:25.437
gotten a little easier.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.406
KENSI: Comms are out.
We're too deep in the tunnels.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.241
CALLEN:
Oh, it gets wider up here.
You two take

33:29.275 --> 33:30.709
the left side,
we'll get on the right side.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.278
Do whatever you have to
to take them out.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.579
KENSI:
Copy that.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.758
That's quite the explosion
they're rigging.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.162
DEEKS: Hey, do me a favor.
Don't shoot that det cord.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.163
I got Jin Woo.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.231
Moving.
Move.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.088
DEEKS:
Damn it.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.256
Cover me!

34:45.617 --> 34:47.619
(both groaning
and grunting)

34:57.896 --> 35:00.399
I don't like knives.
I do not like them at all.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.138
Oh.
You okay?

35:06.172 --> 35:07.539
Yeah. No, I
think I just...

35:07.573 --> 35:09.875
I think I
pulled a hammy.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.183
The barrels are
daisy-chained together.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.451
If one goes,
they all go.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.920
They got motorcycles
for an exit.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.855
This is no
suicide mission.

35:23.889 --> 35:27.293
SAM: They must be putting
a time delay on the prima cord.

35:27.326 --> 35:30.296
I clock Stiger
and one other.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.165
There's three bikes.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.533
Shooter.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.238
CALLEN:
Cover!

35:45.211 --> 35:47.246
I've got Stiger!
I got the bomb!

35:49.915 --> 35:53.185
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

36:12.938 --> 36:15.207
It's over, Stiger.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.275
I, uh...

36:16.308 --> 36:19.611
You should have left well
enough alone, Callen.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.979
Elder's murder was solved.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.781
You did your job.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.583
You didn't have
to keep going.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.519
Good job, all-star.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.920
Do not move.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.857
You have options, you know.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.226
We can bring you in to talk.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.661
You don't have to die here.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.463
No, I won't die here.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.465
Never.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.267
Not on American soil.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.272
Sam!

36:46.305 --> 36:48.874
Sam.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.010
Last one.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.579
Delay's about
to run out.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.623
You guys okay?

37:04.656 --> 37:05.791
We good?

37:05.824 --> 37:06.958
Yeah.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.927
Well,

37:08.960 --> 37:10.796
those are the first bombs

37:10.829 --> 37:13.932
you have correctly
disarmed in quite a while.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.033
Congratulations.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.370
What did you do?

37:20.306 --> 37:21.907
What did you do?

37:21.940 --> 37:24.643
You know. Got in a...
got in a knife fight.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.412
Pulled a hammy.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.879
Pulled a hammy.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.790
So, Stiger and Jin Woo
were operating

37:38.824 --> 37:41.427
independently,
as a rogue team?

37:41.460 --> 37:43.429
Yes. The bomb
materials

37:43.462 --> 37:44.796
have been disposed of,

37:44.830 --> 37:47.366
and Jennifer Kim is back
at the safe house.

37:47.399 --> 37:51.303
Well, it was a pretty good day.
Congratulations.

37:54.373 --> 37:57.443
The te performed today.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.082
Yes, they did.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.551
They worked for you.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.920
They... responded to you.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.956
Yes.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.026
Yes, they did.

38:17.729 --> 38:21.400
Hetty, I'm guessing
you know why I was sent here.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.504
I have my ideas.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.739
It's not personal.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.709
It's not an attack

38:30.742 --> 38:33.412
on your accomplishments
here in Los Angeles.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.847
You do know

38:35.881 --> 38:37.849
that these teams
are never designed

38:37.883 --> 38:41.453
to permanently work together.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.555
I understand.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.357
Team members become

38:45.391 --> 38:47.359
too familiar,

38:47.393 --> 38:50.328
walls go down,
relationships develop.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.102
Sounds like a family to me.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.675
Good night, Hetty.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.711
Good night.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.459
Haven't heard any big booms.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.127
Guess you guys
didn't drop the ball.

39:23.161 --> 39:26.432
Our turn to
say thank you.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.166
Mm. You're welcome.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.901
You still want your payment
in pizza?

39:29.935 --> 39:33.472
Only Mulberry's and only
their eggplant Parm slice.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.740
I think we can do that.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.409
Hmm.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.910
You okay, Sam?

39:38.944 --> 39:40.946
Yeah.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.582
No.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.119
You don't have
to answer this question,

39:48.153 --> 39:50.188
because I don't know
how personal it is.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.990
Okay.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.896
Why did Granger go through
all this trouble to help you?

39:57.929 --> 40:00.832
To set you up
through the State Department

40:00.866 --> 40:02.601
and Justice?

40:04.169 --> 40:06.838
I think...

40:06.872 --> 40:08.874
because he felt guilty.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.144
Granger was a good man,
and I think

40:13.178 --> 40:15.581
he knew he would have been
a great father

40:15.614 --> 40:18.884
to me, but he
never really tried.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.920
When he left
the hospital,

40:21.953 --> 40:24.155
he came here.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.525
Came here to see me. Mm.

40:26.558 --> 40:29.861
We talked, I tried to cook,

40:29.895 --> 40:31.897
we laughed.

40:33.198 --> 40:36.468
I got to know my father,
and he got to know me.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.504
It was a
wonderful week.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.874
Where did he go when he left?

40:44.910 --> 40:46.912
Come on.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.163
Hollyleaf cherry
grows wild out here.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.500
Every morning,
Granger would wake up early,

41:08.534 --> 41:11.570
take a short walk around
the house and pick some berries.

41:11.603 --> 41:15.173
He was off his meds,
getting really weak.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.677
When I woke up that day,

41:18.710 --> 41:21.547
I couldn't find him
in the house, so I went outside.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.518
Wasn't where he
usually walked.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.520
I don't know why,

41:28.554 --> 41:32.824
but I looked up the hill
at this oak tree.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.527
Found him there.

41:43.068 --> 41:46.572
He died leaning
up against the tree,

41:46.605 --> 41:48.574
looking out at the valley.

41:53.111 --> 41:57.749
* Oh, as soon
as I find the time *

41:57.783 --> 42:00.852
* I'm gonna run
right to you, girl... *

42:00.886 --> 42:04.623
Guess I felt like he should have
that view forever.

42:04.656 --> 42:08.293
* Oh, yeah

42:08.326 --> 42:12.798
* If I give you all I got

42:12.831 --> 42:17.135
* Would you give me
all you have to give? *

42:17.168 --> 42:20.772
* If I give you all I got

42:20.806 --> 42:25.310
* Would you give me
all you have to give? *

42:25.343 --> 42:28.747
* If I give you all I got

42:28.780 --> 42:32.618
* If I give you
all I got *

42:32.651 --> 42:33.985
* Yeah.
