12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
of the Aglaeca, 1806?

12:56.863 --> 12:59.126
Uh, in print, yes. What have you got there?

12:59.169 --> 13:01.171
Bound copy of the Horseshoe Bay Gazette.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.825
Not your most reliable publication,

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
unless you like your journalism biased.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.481
We're pretty straight shooters.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.484
Then the Coronet
is the paper for you.

13:09.527 --> 13:14.054
They were the first
to source the folktale...

13:16.099 --> 13:18.058
...to an actual woman.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.929
How well do you know
the Aglaeca?

13:19.973 --> 13:22.105
The story or the entity itself?

13:22.149 --> 13:24.978
How would you know
the entity itself?

13:25.021 --> 13:26.849
We met, briefly.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.896
Oh, no. No, no, you're mistaken.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.768
Credible eyewitness accounts
of the Aglaeca

13:32.812 --> 13:35.031
are extraordinarily rare.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.033
She's not your common
street ghost.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.080
She's the white whale.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.952
She did have a tail.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.301
We summoned her.

13:45.737 --> 13:49.698
The two of us and a group of our friends

13:49.741 --> 13:51.091
and Owen Marvin.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.006
Owen Marvin?

13:53.049 --> 13:55.008
She wanted his blood as a toll,

13:55.051 --> 13:57.880
and we didn't exactly pay in full.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.708
In all my years as keeper,

13:59.751 --> 14:03.886
I've-I've never encountered
anyone who's summoned her.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.714
[camera clicking]
I'll need to check the
previous keeper's records.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.890
Will that tell us how to save ourselves

14:07.934 --> 14:10.545
from becoming her next victims?

14:10.588 --> 14:13.069
Next?

14:13.113 --> 14:17.726
But Owen died yesterday,
and you're both still alive.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.902
Yeah. As far as we know.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.079
In all the reputable lore
I've heard about the Aglaeca,

14:23.123 --> 14:26.039
if you don't pay her toll,
she collects all souls at once.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.563
If she was the one to
take your friend's life,

14:28.606 --> 14:31.087
she would've taken yours
the same day.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.264
But then, who killed Owen?

14:41.097 --> 14:42.882
If Owen wasn't killed
by a vengeful spirit,

14:42.925 --> 14:44.753
are we looking
for a vengeful person?

14:44.796 --> 14:46.798
How crazy have things gotten
that we never even considered

14:46.842 --> 14:49.932
that the murderer
could be an actual human?

14:49.976 --> 14:52.195
Yeah. Sidenote from
the historical society:

14:52.239 --> 14:54.284
we are still on the hook
for the Aglaeca curse.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.852
BESS: But this is the problem
that we are facing, okay?

14:56.896 --> 15:01.813
Who... who would want
revenge on Owen?

15:01.857 --> 15:03.250
Someone with a serious grudge,

15:03.293 --> 15:05.948
or someone who stood
to gain from his death.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.037
Yeah, we're, um,

15:08.081 --> 15:10.953
we're kind of surrounded
by possible Marvin heirs.

15:10.997 --> 15:14.957
Yeah, but the way
he was killed, I just, I...

15:15.001 --> 15:18.091
I don't see any of my cousins
doing something like that.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.658
They could've hired someone who
could do something like that.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.139
Bess, do you feel comfortable
talking to your family?

15:23.183 --> 15:24.793
Seeing if there are
any possible motives?

15:24.836 --> 15:27.056
Um, we're not the only
ones digging here.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.102
Detective Lisbeth brought
a whole forensic team.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.407
BESS:
Oh, my God.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.018
Use that to our advantage.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.671
If the cops are there, now is a good time

15:33.715 --> 15:35.325
for us to check out Owen's apartment.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.153
You mean his room at the estate?

15:37.197 --> 15:39.199
He had a private apartment
on the other side of town.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.418
That's where he went if he
wanted to get away from family

15:41.462 --> 15:45.422
or if he had a guest over.

15:45.466 --> 15:50.079
Bess, uh, are you cool handling
the investigation on your end?

15:50.123 --> 15:52.255
Yeah, um, guys,
she's already gone.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.865
[camera clicking]

15:53.909 --> 15:55.780
A selfie? Really? You don't need to check.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.347
I'm not even driving.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.219
This isn't a blood alcohol test, Ms. Marvin.

15:59.262 --> 16:02.352
It's a DNA swap to clear you as a suspect.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.007
You could've let me know you were coming.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.443
Uh, yeah, I could have,

16:06.487 --> 16:08.445
but I didn't want to wait for an invitation.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.925
WHITNEY: What is going on here?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.144
This is a private affair.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.798
Yes, and this is a court order.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
These are very broad parameters.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.458
You do know there are,
minimum, 11 lawyers here?

16:21.502 --> 16:24.026
I look forward to swabbing
each and every one of them.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.767
I'll make sure to make a note
you were not interested

16:25.810 --> 16:27.247
in being eliminated
as a suspect. No,

16:27.290 --> 16:29.031
I-I'll go first.

16:29.075 --> 16:33.122
On behalf of the Marvin family,
we are happy to cooperate.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.083
On behalf of the police,
we appreciate that.

16:38.562 --> 16:41.826
Hey, well, do you suspect
someone in my family?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
I'm not prepared to say.

16:44.873 --> 16:48.442
Okay, so, can you let me know
when you are prepared to say?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.575
I could.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.320
The cops are back? Please.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.322
There hasn't been
a Marvin in bracelets

16:59.366 --> 17:01.498
since the feud
with Harry Winston.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.153
Does that mean you don't
suspect anyone in your family?

17:04.197 --> 17:06.242
Or that they just get away
with everything?

17:09.071 --> 17:12.901
If you expect the goss
on my living relatives, well,

17:12.944 --> 17:18.907
let me just say:
Marvins don't rat.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.214
Isaac catfished his caddie.

17:21.257 --> 17:25.218
Took his identity, ruined his
credit, bought a hovercraft.

17:25.261 --> 17:29.135
All because of a bad read on the 18th green.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.006
But he loved Owen.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.008
And he's too cheap to hire a hit man.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.575
Whitney might. She had a boy

17:34.618 --> 17:36.620
smash up this married guy's car once,

17:36.664 --> 17:38.361
'cause she was dumb enough to fall for him.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.276
What?

17:40.320 --> 17:43.062
Like, how desperate do you have
to be to be someone's mistress?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.237
[laughs softly]

17:47.979 --> 17:49.068
NICK:
Hey.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.983
You okay?

17:52.027 --> 17:53.594
Yeah.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.335
Just divide and conquer. I...

17:57.337 --> 17:59.339
Are you trying to push me away?

18:04.692 --> 18:07.564
I'm sorry.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.653
I forgot. No one likes that.

18:09.697 --> 18:13.396
I'll just meet up with you later, okay?

18:28.542 --> 18:31.066
WHITNEY:
Does Aunt Diana know you've
got your other friends

18:31.110 --> 18:32.720
playing amateur detective, too?

18:32.763 --> 18:35.723
Yeah, Diana wants me
to help, with Owen.

18:35.766 --> 18:39.030
UNDERTAKER [over phone]:
Ms. Marvin, please confirm
the spelling of the programs.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.381
Owen's middle name? Yes, it's Tiberius.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.297
T-I-B-E-R-I-U-S.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.689
Thank you.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.691
Our deepest sympathies. Thank you so much.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.998
But I'm handling this.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.218
Okay. Um,

18:52.261 --> 18:55.351
there is no good way
for it to go.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.179
Okay? This should not

18:57.223 --> 18:59.181
have happened at all.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.315
We need to select pallbearers and speakers.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.230
You know, I could
really use your help.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.057
I don't know your game.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.583
But you won't win.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.544
Wow, my family
are mean-spirited,

19:14.588 --> 19:17.112
self-medicating narcissists,

19:17.156 --> 19:18.766
but...

19:18.809 --> 19:21.812
I think they all loved Owen.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.814
Not as much as they love
themselves, but still.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.468
Yeah.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.470
I mean, I don't see
a killer among them, either.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.820
For every photo Cassidy posts,

19:29.864 --> 19:31.561
there's a thousand
others in her phone.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
Does she have an alibi on there?

19:33.259 --> 19:35.174
Yeah. A dozen
shots of herself

19:35.217 --> 19:37.088
at the party at the
time of the murder.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.482
And enough of all
your cousins, so...

19:39.526 --> 19:41.876
No....none of them
held the knife.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.810
No sign of Tinker Bell?

20:04.812 --> 20:07.336
Nope.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.211
Not everybody comes back.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.738
I know lately you've been
pummeled by life.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.480
Everything you learned about
your parents and now...

20:22.525 --> 20:26.399
If you ever want to talk
about anything, I'm here.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.880
I really appreciate that.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.537
If I find the words,
I will share them with you.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.194
[exhales]

20:39.238 --> 20:42.197
But until then, how great is it
that I can avoid talking about

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
my two dads by avoiding talking
about my dead boyfriend?

20:52.425 --> 20:53.948
Hey, look at that.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.866
It says "Marvin storage unit" on it.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.650
Don't suppose you know
where the key is?

21:01.695 --> 21:02.870
[quietly]:
Mm-mm.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.567
Never mind.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.701
Found one.

21:07.744 --> 21:10.225
Hey, Ace.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.358
Someone was here.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.324
Someone was watching Owen.
The print's not even dry.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.412
Couldn't be more than a day old.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.414
I appreciate the call, Nancy.
Great.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.633
Return the favor.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.678
Your forensic team
at the Marvin estate,

21:28.722 --> 21:30.680
they're collecting DNA samples.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.247
What are they comparing it to?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.293
I respect that you
are dealing with a huge loss,

21:34.336 --> 21:35.729
but inserting yourself
into a murder investigation

21:35.772 --> 21:37.426
isn't the way to do it.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.733
Agree to disagree. Do you
have the killer's DNA?

21:39.776 --> 21:43.040
[scoffs]
Where'd you get it?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.957
Off of Owen.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.309
He fought back.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.354
We obtained skin samples

21:52.398 --> 21:54.487
from under Owen's fingernails, yeah.

21:56.663 --> 21:59.622
And the-the-the
print on the window?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.363
When will you get
the results back?

22:01.407 --> 22:03.322
Uh, unfortunately, I don't
think we're going to.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.801
Why is that?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.586
The handprint was clear,

22:06.629 --> 22:07.804
but there weren't any fingerprints,

22:07.848 --> 22:09.937
as if the tips of the fingers were covered.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.852
We found a similar print on Owen's phone.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.680
There were trace amounts of
an unidentified substance.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.725
The lab's testing it now.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.032
Is there anything else
that you can tell me?

22:19.033 --> 22:21.949
Please.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.386
Let me help.
Uh... use me.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.390
Uh... what about him?

22:28.434 --> 22:30.349
Can I use him?

22:34.570 --> 22:36.442
[whispers]:
You got this.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.534
Hey.
Hey.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.753
Is everything okay?
Is this about Nancy?

22:43.797 --> 22:45.712
What? No.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.540
I mean, yeah.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.802
I mean...

22:50.804 --> 22:53.502
Look...

22:53.546 --> 22:56.200
what Nancy said earlier about
all the women in your life...

22:57.811 --> 23:00.727
...how we all get messed up
because of you...

23:00.770 --> 23:03.077
Wait, this is about us?

23:03.120 --> 23:06.950
George, we talked about this.
What we did was wrong, but we...

23:06.994 --> 23:09.170
No.

23:09.213 --> 23:13.000
What you did to me. You're right.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.742
I should've never
strung you along at all.

23:15.785 --> 23:19.746
But... I thought, I thought
that we were okay now.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.878
Yeah, I thought I was okay.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.054
But how could I be? George,

23:24.098 --> 23:26.796
you never said that you weren't.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.538
I mean, in fairness, you always
said you wanted to be with me.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.192
Because I was 17!

23:31.235 --> 23:34.195
I was 17, and I had a crush on you,

23:34.238 --> 23:35.762
and I thought it was something more,

23:35.805 --> 23:37.677
because I didn't know any better.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.462
You did.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.639
You're right.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.728
I was, I was being stupid,

23:45.772 --> 23:49.036
and a-a liar,
and I made you think

23:49.079 --> 23:51.038
that I was gonna leave Tiffany.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.169
My life was a mess.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.520
Your life?

23:55.651 --> 23:58.915
No, Ryan, you are not the victim here.

23:58.959 --> 24:03.006
George, I'm so... You made it so I
believed everything that you said.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.182
So I could never trust anyone else.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.055
You made me think that I
didn't deserve any better.

24:08.098 --> 24:11.014
You made me think that I
didn't want any better.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.148
You made me okay with being
a dirty little secret

24:14.191 --> 24:17.760
because I was a 17-year-old
girl from a poor family
