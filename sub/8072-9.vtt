ROSEANNE CONNER: Jackie,
what'd you do with the napkins?

00:09.377 --> 00:11.011
JACKIE HARRIS: What napkins?

00:11.045 --> 00:13.447
God, you did order
napkins, didn't ya?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.049
Well, no because I
didn't know the exact right

00:15.083 --> 00:16.184
amount of napkins to order.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.118
Well, great.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.219
Now we have the
exact right amount

00:18.252 --> 00:20.254
of napkins for zero sandwiches.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.323
Anything would be
better than that.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.993
NANCY BARLETT: Hey, I have
some Kleenex in my purse.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.362
Here, Darlene, go
get some napkins.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.834
DARLENE CONNER: I can't
get napkins with $0.50.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.169
Yeah, you can.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.671
You go down there to that
chicken place, and buy a soda,

00:37.705 --> 00:40.208
and then steal all there's.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.875
Anything else you'd like?

00:41.909 --> 00:45.946
Spoons, forks, a chair?

00:45.979 --> 00:48.015
So we ready for the
big grand opening?

00:48.048 --> 00:48.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48.949 --> 00:49.917
OK, OK, let's do it.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.820
[singing]

00:54.922 --> 00:57.391
[cheering]

00:57.425 --> 01:00.094
So Jackie, I hope you
remembered to buy the frame

01:00.128 --> 01:01.295
for our first dollar bill.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.863
Yes, it's right there
under the counter.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.732
Was that such a good idea?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.067
I mean shouldn't we reinvest
it back into the business?

01:07.101 --> 01:08.001
Here it comes.

01:08.035 --> 01:08.902
Here it comes.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.472
This is our first dollar.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.306
Hi.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.411
Well, can we help you?

01:17.445 --> 01:18.812
CUSTOMER 1: Sure, I'd like a--

01:18.846 --> 01:21.115
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get in position.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.750
OK, go.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.453
Like a cup of coffee.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.456
No problem, and?

01:28.489 --> 01:31.425
And, uh, cream.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.326
And.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.329
And thank you very much.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.034
It's only $0.65.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.103
Well, that's gonna
look lousy in a frame.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.411
So how about one of our
nice loose meat sandwiches

01:50.444 --> 01:51.379
to go with the coffee?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.149
No, thanks.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.722
Would you like a piece of pie?

02:01.755 --> 02:02.823
No.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.992
A cookie?

02:05.025 --> 02:06.994
No.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.029
Some gum?

02:09.062 --> 02:10.664
OK, Roseanne, all right.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.200
We'll get it from
the next customer.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.702
No, no, it's first
customer first dollar.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.170
That's the way it goes.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.240
Let it go, Roseanne.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.475
OK, that'll be $0.65.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.910
Uh, did you have a restroom?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.445
Around the back.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.881
That'll be $0.35.

[music playing]

03:19.032 --> 03:21.735
ROSEANNE CONNER: Well, don't
get used to my being home Dan,

03:21.769 --> 03:24.104
because I got stuck with
the night shift again.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.073
First, mom calls in sick.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.776
Then Fischer calls over
there to say he's sick.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.479
Then Jackie starts whining
about her little snuffle bear,

03:31.512 --> 03:32.913
and that made me sick.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.384
So I told her to go home,
so I get an hour off.

03:36.417 --> 03:41.121
So I can come over here and
make dinner for my family.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.724
Now what am I supposed to do
with the other 56 minutes?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.363
Dan, say Dan, are you
even listening to me?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.234
Arnie, what the hell
are you doin' here?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.370
ARNIE THOMAS: Dan, Dan,
get out here and help me!

03:56.404 --> 03:57.271
Dan!

03:57.305 --> 03:58.238
DAN CONNER: Oh, boy.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.340
Calm down, honey, honey.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.875
Why would you even
let him into my house

04:01.909 --> 04:03.311
after the way he dumped Nancy?

04:03.344 --> 04:04.545
DAN CONNER: I couldn't help it.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.680
He was whimpering and
scratching at the back door.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.749
ARNIE THOMAS: Now Rosie, this
is the last house I went to.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.183
I went everywhere else I knew.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.752
The lights were on, cars
were in the driveway,

04:11.785 --> 04:12.653
but nobody was home.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.055
It was really weird.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.024
I was outside.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.727
How could you
tell Nancy that you

04:19.760 --> 04:21.962
were abducted by space aliens?

04:21.995 --> 04:25.333
There's not even a 12
step program for that.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.700
Call her off, Dan.
Call her off.

04:26.734 --> 04:27.801
DAN CONNER: You
got to appreciate

04:27.835 --> 04:29.002
my situation here, Arn.

04:29.036 --> 04:29.903
She's my wife.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.672
I got to let her hurt ya.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.442
I hear ya, buddy.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.644
All right, I was a weasel to
sneak out on Nancy like that,

04:36.677 --> 04:38.312
but that marriage thing
was harder than I thought.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.914
You know, one morning I woke
up and I couldn't breathe.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.816
There was this heavy
weight on my chest.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.184
It was Nancy.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.220
She was trying to kill me, so
I got the hell out of there.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.923
But listen, I'm back, and
I want to patch things up.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.626
Well, Nancy happens to
be really happy right now,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.128
so I don't want you to go
screwing with her life.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.366
She's not with
another guy, is she?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.668
Well, no.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.303
Well that's great because
then I'm back in the saddle.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.505
Listen Dan, I'm
gonna go over there.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.406
Do me a favor.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.674
Smell me.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.276
You can't just go
over there, Arnie.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.211
A lot of things have
changed in this town

05:11.244 --> 05:12.780
since you were here last.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.415
Like what?

05:14.448 --> 05:18.318
Like Nancy's a lesbian, and
we got a new Lenscrafters.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.460
Woah, woah, woah.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.429
Come again.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.798
Yes, Dan, glasses
in less than an hour.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.369
Nancy's gay?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.004
Our Nancy, Arnie's Nancy?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.139
Yes, and now Marla's Nancy.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.941
DAN CONNER: Nancy's
dating Marla?

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
Yowza.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.380
Hey, I'll bet that
Marla's a lesbian too.

[music playing]

06:00.127 --> 06:02.530
DAN CONNER: All
right, see your two,

06:02.563 --> 06:03.831
and I'll bump you two more.

06:03.864 --> 06:08.035
TY TILDEN: Call,
I got a straight.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.169
ARNIE THOMAS: Straight, huh?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.071
A straight, is that a
crack about my ex-wife?

06:11.104 --> 06:16.510
DAN CONNER: Woah, woah,
woah there big guy.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
He didn't mean anything by it.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.280
Sorry.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.815
MAN 1: Beats me.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.850
I just got a pair of ladies.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.684
ARNIE THOMAS: That's it.

06:28.822 --> 06:34.928
MAN 2: Relax, all
right, now sit down.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.397
Arnie, nobody's judging
you because your ex-wife's

06:37.431 --> 06:38.766
dating a woman.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.769
DAN CONNER: Yeah, Arnie, It
could have happened to anybody.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.937
Well, most people,
or maybe just you.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.606
Huge deal.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.008
Well, then tell
me something guys.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.276
You got your lesbians, right?

06:49.309 --> 06:50.644
MEN: Yeah.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.880
How in hell can a woman be
satisfied by someone that does

06:52.913 --> 06:54.582
not have the right equipment?

06:54.615 --> 06:57.551
You could buy the equipment.

MAN 1: [lawn mower starting]

07:00.521 --> 07:02.890
[laughter]

07:04.458 --> 07:09.196
OK, OK, OK, I don't get that,
but, you know, I'm telling

07:09.229 --> 07:10.698
you guys she had no complaints.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.468
I've had a lot of women fake it
on me, and I can always tell.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.803
Maybe that's it, Arn.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.204
Maybe you're just so
darn good in the sack

07:17.237 --> 07:20.874
that you ruined
her for other guys.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.243
Nah.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.413
Look Arnie, you
can't blame yourself.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.015
She's probably
always liked women.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.517
So what are you saying, Ty?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.719
You're saying, I'm like a
woman, that I'm womanly?

07:31.752 --> 07:34.622
Is that what you're saying?

07:34.655 --> 07:37.525
It's pretty ridiculous, huh.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.894
[laughing]

07:40.928 --> 07:42.195
Right, guys?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.432
Are you in, buddy?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.568
Yeah, and I'll raise you two.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.136
Make all the jokes
you want, guys.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.204
I loved her, and it still hurts.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.073
We'd still be together
if I hadn't dumped her.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.274
Sorry, Arn.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.809
Yeah, Arnie, we're
all really sorry,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.144
and we all think
you're really manly.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.045
Don't we, guys?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.580
[grunting]

08:01.649 --> 08:07.120
Absolutely, and see your two,
and I'll bump you two more.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.421
That's too rich for my blood.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.322
I fold.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.959
Real man wouldn't fold.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.594
All right, I call.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.062
What do you got?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.029
An eight.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.003
[music playing]

08:26.106 --> 08:29.142

sure tell all your friends.

[beat boxing]

08:40.320 --> 08:42.690
Hey, I don't mean to
bug you or anything,

08:42.723 --> 08:44.658
but it's getting to
be like 9 o'clock.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.193
And I need to close up now.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.729
CUSTOMER: Could I
have some more coffee?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.765
Well, like all that's left
is just sediment in the pot,

08:51.799 --> 08:55.135
ya know, but hey, how about
five or six packets of sugar

08:55.168 --> 08:57.170
to help you with
your next drum solo?

08:57.204 --> 09:02.175
I said, can I have
some more coffee?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.476
Yeah, OK.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.377
Calm down.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.478
I'll get you some coffee.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.121
I'm not doing anything, OK.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.289
You don't have to call anybody.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.758
I wasn't gonna call anybody.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.659
I'm just getting your coffee.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.132
OK, here.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.800
Well, I put it in a
to go cup, you know,

09:26.834 --> 09:28.201
because I'm sure you
want to, you know, go.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.858
[phone ringing]

10:11.244 --> 10:12.913
I'm gonna drive around
and look for this guy.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.214
What'd he look like?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.984
He just looked like a
regular lunatic, you know?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.524
Could you be more specific?

10:24.557 --> 10:26.727
Yeah, OK, he looks
like the kind guy

10:26.760 --> 10:28.361
that Darlene's gonna
bring home, and we're

10:28.395 --> 10:29.262
gonna have to call son.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.001
You're not helping, Roseanne.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.302
I got to do something
here, and I think

10:35.335 --> 10:37.337
it requires physical violence.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.139
Would you just calm down, Dan?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.208
Just give me a minute to
get myself together here.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.343
Please get me a beer.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.747
When I'm done, I'll
let you crush the can.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.182
I mean you got
women there alone.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.583
I'd feel a hell of
a lot better if you

10:50.617 --> 10:52.519
started closing before dark.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.155
No, we'll just make sure
there's always at least two

10:55.188 --> 10:56.189
of us on each shift.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.091
OK, it'd probably
never happen again.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.261
You don't know that.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.496
Would you consider getting
a gun for the diner?

11:03.530 --> 11:04.965
Oh, there's a great idea.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.634
A loaded gun in the same room
with my mother and my sister.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.742
What if they miss each other,
and they kill a customer?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.643
Then they'll have to reload.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.411
Come on, Roseanne.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.412
This is important.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.513
We'll teach you how to use it.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.782
No, forget about it.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.682
No.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.451
This is serious, Roseanne.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.618
You got to do
something about this.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.587
You got to do it now.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.923
What'd I do?

11:29.957 --> 11:31.258
Nothing.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.760
Really?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.728
You're mother had a
run in with some creep

11:34.762 --> 11:37.264
at the diner tonight, and
she won't listen to reason.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.198
Are you OK?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.367
Yeah, he didn't
rob us or nothing.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.435
He just kept wanting me
to give him more coffee.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.242
Mom, that's a customer.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.856
So, Arnie came by my
apartment last night.

12:02.890 --> 12:07.761
Thinks he can win me back like
I'm some big lesbian trophy.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.463
I'd so like to know
who told him I was gay.

12:10.497 --> 12:14.434
Oh, um, I think
Jackie told him.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.170
The guy is unbelievable.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.306
He even brings me
some trashy lingerie.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.375
Man, tacky underwear,
that's so Arnie.

12:22.409 --> 12:28.916
Ugh, he is such a pig,
but it looks great on Marla.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.719
Hey, I'd like a table with
a view of the cute waitress

12:32.752 --> 12:33.620
please.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.454
Huh, stup.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.693
What are you doin' here?

12:40.727 --> 12:41.829
Hey, I got shoes.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.729
I got shirt.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.965
I want service.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.933
I'll have the usual.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.134
Well, I'm busy.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.302
Would you rather
have a sandwich?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.972
No, I think I'll
start with drinks,

12:52.005 --> 12:56.977
perhaps a large orange, no
ice, and maybe some appetizers.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.311
Are your chips good tonight?

12:58.345 --> 13:01.214
How long do you plan to be
here on psycho patrol, Dan?

13:01.248 --> 13:02.382
Till closing.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.151
That is just
not possible, Dan.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.920
Because if you sit here, and
watch me serving people food,

13:06.954 --> 13:08.989
and cleaning up, then that
will take all the romance

13:09.022 --> 13:11.791
out of it when I do it at home.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.227
If you're not gonna
do anything about this,

13:14.261 --> 13:16.729
I'm gonna stay here and
make sure you're safe.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.231
It's my job.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.767
It's what you pay me for.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.836
I'm handling it, OK?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.838
See-- see that sticker
over there on the door.

13:24.872 --> 13:28.408
This premise is protected by the
Lantron Security Alarm Systems.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.309
Where'd you get that?

13:29.342 --> 13:32.579
I stoled it.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.348
I feel safer already.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.384
Got to go, Dan, or
I'm gonna have to come

13:37.417 --> 13:38.285
over there and throw you out.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.559
You're gonna throw me out?

13:46.593 --> 13:49.829
Come on, Dan.

13:49.863 --> 13:53.133
I don't have time for your
macho Robert De Niro crap.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.139
Come on now.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.509
You couldn't throw somebody
out if you had to, woman.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.979
Oh, you're so mature.

14:06.013 --> 14:06.813
Jackie, Nancy!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.618
This creep giving
you trouble, Roseanne?

14:11.651 --> 14:15.822
Yes, he keeps insisting he's
my husband, and he won't leave.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.158
[laughing]

14:18.191 --> 14:19.692
Jackie, you get his legs.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.660
Here you got his arms.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.495
I'll get the rest.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.432
[grunting]

14:29.036 --> 14:31.004
All right, I got it.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.473
[screaming]

14:33.506 --> 14:35.708
Dammit, Roseanne.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.678
You're not going to know some
maniac's special tickle spot.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.414
Obviously, I do.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.784
OK, OK, you
don't want me here.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.721
I'm gone, but you can't
get rid of me that easy.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.458
I'll be sitting out
front in my car.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.493
Man, is he stubborn.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.895
I think I pulled something.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.965
Oh, you know, he
just means well.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.166
He's worried about us.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.434
He wants to make sure
we're all, you know, safe.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.869
What're you doing?

15:02.902 --> 15:07.474
Oh, I'm just gonna
get his car towed.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.877
[music playing]

15:13.947 --> 15:16.883
[grunting]

15:16.916 --> 15:19.852
Wow, I didn't know they
turned this into a karate place.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.623
Last time I was here it was
a tatets, taters, taters.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.592
KARATE INSTRUCTOR 1:
Excuse me, ladies.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.861
We're trying to put on
a demonstration here.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.630
[screaming]

15:32.099 --> 15:33.600
God, buy a saw.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.540
With a mouth like that,
you'll need self-defense.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.143
Ordinarily, I'd
get mad at that,

15:43.176 --> 15:44.744
but I'd hate for the last
thing I ever see to be

15:44.777 --> 15:46.980
his forehead coming at me.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.982
Don't worry about
him, Roseanne.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
That's not what we're
gonna be studying.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.685
This is what we're
gonna be studying.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.454
STUDENT: No, no, no.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.455
How cool.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.927
INSTRUCTOR: Now remember,
we'll be simulating

16:00.960 --> 16:03.363
real attacks here, so
I want you to fight

16:03.396 --> 16:05.698
back as hard as you can.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.833
Any questions?

16:06.866 --> 16:08.235
Yes, Rosie.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.637
Uh, when are you gonna
bring out that guy in the suit

16:10.670 --> 16:14.807
because I'd like to kick
that guy in the suit.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.610
We'll get there very soon.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.514
OK, now passivity
is your worst enemy,

16:21.548 --> 16:25.385
so the first thing we learn to
do here is to say no to men.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.322
You sure you took this class?

16:29.356 --> 16:32.692
This no gets you in
touch with your power.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.461
So what's the
first thing you say

16:34.494 --> 16:36.196
to a man who wants to hurt you?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.464
CLASS: No.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.866
Good, very good.

16:39.899 --> 16:43.036
All right, I'd like to introduce
our attacker for this evening.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.204
His name is Fred.
ROSEANNE CONNER: Yay.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.605
KARATE INSTRUCTOR 2: No, boo.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.974
[booing]

16:48.007 --> 16:50.477
The first thing we're
gonna do is frontal attacks.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.079
Any volunteers?

16:52.112 --> 16:52.979
Rosie.

16:53.012 --> 16:53.880
OK.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.715
Save some for me.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.285
All right, I'm gonna show you
a simple way to take down a 220

16:58.318 --> 16:59.219
pound assailant, all right?

16:59.252 --> 17:00.620
OK.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.355
First thing I want you to do
is clump your fingers together

17:02.389 --> 17:03.223
like this.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.491
Oh, yeah, I get it.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.793
And then when he tries to
guess what animal I make,

17:06.826 --> 17:07.794
and I knee him in the crotch.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.765
No, you're gonna use
your fingers to strike

17:12.799 --> 17:14.134
your assailant in the eye.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.503
No!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.571
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.940
Hey, uh, could you do that
to a guy that's still asleep,

17:20.973 --> 17:22.909
or would that be unfair?

17:22.942 --> 17:25.645
Then after the eye
strike, that's when I want

17:25.678 --> 17:26.746
you to knee him in the groin.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.647
OK.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.516
No!
Don't worry.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.917
He's well protected.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.019
Now the last step
is a knockout blow.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.954
When Fred takes
you to the ground,

17:34.987 --> 17:36.523
I want you to kick
him in the head

17:36.556 --> 17:38.158
until he puts his hands
in front of his face,

17:38.191 --> 17:39.058
and I blow the whistle.

17:39.092 --> 17:39.992
That means stop.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.461
- OK.
- You ready?

17:41.494 --> 17:42.729
Yeah.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.799
All right, now a lot of
women find this very traumatic.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.968
Your first instinct
may be to panic,

17:49.001 --> 17:51.804
stop breathing, even run.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.039
So you just do the best you can.

17:53.072 --> 17:53.940
OK.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.308
All right.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.209
All right.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.910
OK.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.746
Rosie is ready.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.713
FRED: Hey, you.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.681
Hey.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.649
INSTRUCTOR: Get him.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.550
Get him.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.584
Kick him hard.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.552
Kick him.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.488
Kick him.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.890
[whistle blow]

18:10.923 --> 18:12.825
[cheering]

18:12.859 --> 18:13.893
Hey, that's fun.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.129
Do you have a home
version of that game?

18:16.163 --> 18:19.666
All right, let's talk about
our attackers vulnerable spots.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.733
Yo, Nancy.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.502
[gasping]

18:22.535 --> 18:24.271
Don't mean to
bother you, women,

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
but I need to speak
to that chick right

18:25.638 --> 18:26.973
over there real quick.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.008
Oh man, do you want me to go
kick him in the head for ya?

18:29.041 --> 18:31.178
Ugh, it won't
make any difference.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.512
I'll be right back.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.584
Arnie, what the hell
are you doing here?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.819
Why won't you
talk to me, Nance?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.355
I'm gonna tell
you one more time.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.556
I'm gay.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.058
It has nothing to do with
you or your masculinity.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.794
Of course it doesn't.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.329
I'm still every bit
the man I always was.

18:49.362 --> 18:53.466
Last night I beat up three guys
in a topless bar to prove it.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.134
I mean you just don't get it.

18:55.168 --> 18:59.439
It's about love,
trust, and commitment.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.909
What we had was not natural.

19:02.942 --> 19:06.246
I can accept that,
and I know that we

19:06.279 --> 19:07.447
won't get back together.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.748
But that doesn't mean you
and me can't, you know,

19:08.781 --> 19:10.583
do it one more time.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.684
Swine.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.952
All right, if it's
about that Marla broad,

19:12.985 --> 19:13.853
you can bring her along.

19:13.886 --> 19:14.954
Arnie.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.289
OK, OK, can I at least
watch or something?

19:16.323 --> 19:17.757
I want to be in there somewhere.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.760
No!

19:20.793 --> 19:24.163
[cheering]

19:31.204 --> 19:32.272
Come on out here, Dan.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.341
I want you to see I can
take care of myself.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.142
Now get your butt out here.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.577
Now do you have on
all your equipment?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.747
Yeah, like I'm gonna need it.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.916
OK, well, now go over there,
and then when I tell you to,

19:43.950 --> 19:45.218
you're gonna come at me.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.754
You know, but I want you to
really, really come at me.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.155
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.191
I was all district offensive
lineman three years in a row.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.427
Are you gonna bore me
into unconsciousness,

19:54.461 --> 19:57.063
or you gonna put on that hat?

19:57.096 --> 19:58.030
Oh, hurt me.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.003
OK, come on, Dan.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.937
I'm ready for ya.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.240
Come on.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.875
Who is that, a chicken?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.910
Oh, my eye, my eye.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.480
Oh--

20:13.513 --> 20:15.882
[music playing]

20:21.854 --> 20:24.324
ALIEN 1: I'm losing
patience with you, Human.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.859
You were supposed to bring
back the female specimen

20:26.893 --> 20:28.160
for breeding stock.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.263
ARNIE THOMAS: Yeah, well,
she's not into that anymore.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.736
ALIEN 2: Now we will
have to cross breed him

20:36.769 --> 20:39.606
with one of the other species.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.509
How about the cacti pony

20:42.542 --> 20:44.444
Cacti pony, that sounds good.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.778
I like a little variety.

20:45.812 --> 20:50.950
Good idea, we'll have the
female de-fanged immediately.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.452
Wait a minute, guys.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.720
Wait I got an even
a better idea.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.921
Why don't you give
me a new mission?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.223
Why don't I go down there
and mutilate some cows?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.991
Don't worry, Human.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.260
We have vastly improved
our crossbreeding system

21:01.294 --> 21:03.896
since the last time we
tried to pollinate you.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.931
Yeah, well, I hope so.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.098
You got to be a
little more careful

21:06.132 --> 21:07.367
when you're picking my dates.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.336
The last one I had to put
bags on two of her heads.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.174
Michael, Michael,

21:15.207 --> 21:16.676
MICHAEL FISHMAN: I
wasn't in enough scenes.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.044
You aren't in
this scene either.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.446
Look, it's Arnie and the aliens.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.618
I wanna be an alien.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.519
All right, guys.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.120
Beat it.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.022
Six hours of make up for this.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.094
You know, you do look
kind of like a little Spock.

21:35.127 --> 21:35.995
Don't ya?

21:36.028 --> 21:36.896
You know, Spocks?

21:36.929 --> 21:37.897
Do that.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.933
You look like a little
Spock, don't ya?

21:40.967 --> 21:41.868
You hear about my new show?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.336
MICHAEL FISHMAN:
Um, a little bit.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.036
ARNIE THOMAS: What'd you hear?
Good things?

21:44.070 --> 21:44.871

21:44.904 --> 21:46.506
