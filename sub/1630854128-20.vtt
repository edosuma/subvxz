08:52.009 --> 08:53.924
- Sharon.
Of course, of course.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.317
Just sketch in the aquarium.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.581
I'll be right back.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.061
- An aquarium?

09:00.104 --> 09:02.324
I thought we were only
taking over a couple of rooms

09:02.367 --> 09:04.500
for this new VIP build.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.721
- Well, demand was much
greater than expected.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.287
So at the 11th hour,

09:09.331 --> 09:11.246
Jack decided to take
the entire floor.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.422
- But this is the
geriatrics unit.

09:13.465 --> 09:17.252
Did he even consider
those patients?

09:17.295 --> 09:19.167
- Well, the plan
is to fold geriatrics

09:19.210 --> 09:20.516
into the orthopedic.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.084
- Oh, so that's the plan, huh?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.042
- Clearly,
word didn't get to you.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.392
- Well, clearly.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.917
- I'm so sorry, Sharon.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.745
It must have been an oversight.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.269
Since turning for-profit,
there have been

09:34.312 --> 09:36.314
dozens of new voices
in the mix.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.968
And it's really gummed up
the lines of communication.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.491
- Well, un-gum them.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.102
Because I will not be
left out of the loop

09:41.145 --> 09:43.713
in my own hospital.

09:43.757 --> 09:47.195
- Well, anything further,

09:47.238 --> 09:48.936
and I will notify you myself.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.851
- Good.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.639
- How far do we have to go?

09:56.683 --> 10:00.034
- Uh, just number three
down here on the right.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.471
- [sighs] These poor people,

10:02.514 --> 10:04.168
staring at me,
yet they have no idea

10:04.212 --> 10:06.388
how dangerous this place is.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.217
All the things
they're being exposed to.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.262
You know,
I used to be like them

10:11.306 --> 10:13.787
till I discovered the truth.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.223
- The truth?

10:15.266 --> 10:18.661
What, um, what exactly
do you mean by that?

10:18.705 --> 10:21.142
- Jan, every machine that
could be removed has been,

10:21.185 --> 10:23.057
and the equipment
that we couldn't

10:23.100 --> 10:24.232
has been draped
with a lead vest

10:24.275 --> 10:25.581
like the one
that you're wearing.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
And the walls have
been insulated

10:27.322 --> 10:29.063
with anti-radiation blankets.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.673
- Wow.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.022
You did this fast.
- Yeah.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.241
Protocol, right?

10:33.284 --> 10:35.678
- Here we go.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.333
- Fine. OK.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.683
Jan, that's Tracy.

10:40.727 --> 10:44.078
Be right back.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.993
- Well, she's in.
- Yeah.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.343
Hopefully she's comfortable
enough to let us fix her hand,

10:48.386 --> 10:49.910
but we really got to
figure out this jaundice.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.694
- How we going to do that?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.870
She's taking every tool
we've got out of play.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.702
- Richard, Vickie.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.835
- Dr. Halstead.
- How you been?

11:01.878 --> 11:03.271
- Wonderful.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.795
Last week, he was five months
cancer-free.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.536
- That's fantastic.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.320
- I only wish you could
have treated my clumsiness.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.713
I think I busted my ankle.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.236
- Yeah. I can see that.
What happened?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.804
- Oh, I tripped going
down the stairs.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.023
I've been icing it
for a week,

11:16.066 --> 11:18.852
but it's not getting
any better. [groans]

11:18.895 --> 11:21.028
Vickie made me come in.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.812
- I need him in walking shape.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.423
We're going to Machu Picchu
next month,

11:25.467 --> 11:27.164
hiking the Inca trail.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.733
- We got time back that
I never thought we'd have.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.387
We're trying to make
the most of it.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.954
- That's wonderful.

11:33.997 --> 11:36.043
We'll get some X-rays, but
I suspect it's just a sprain.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.827
- Oh, that's good to hear,

11:37.871 --> 11:40.612
considering last time
we were here.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.571
Thank God for OR 2.0.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.878
- Yeah, Richard,
you were its first patient.

11:44.921 --> 11:48.098
Your success was
a real inspiration.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.405
- Oh, shoot, honey,
I left my cell in the car.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.407
Do you mind grabbing it for me?
- Sure.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.889
I'll be right back.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.413
[groaning] Oh, God.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.241
- Richard, you all right?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.722
- I needed her
to leave for a minute.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.594
[groaning]
- What's going on?

12:05.637 --> 12:07.901
- I tripped because
I've been weak.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.511
There's a dull pain
in my belly,

12:09.554 --> 12:11.905
and I haven't had an appetite.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.821
[strained breathing]

12:14.864 --> 12:17.388
The cancer's back.
I know it.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.781
- Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

12:18.825 --> 12:22.437
We'll run some tests
and go from there.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.267
So I assume Vickie
doesn't know.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.096
- I can't bring myself
to tell her.

12:29.139 --> 12:34.492
Since my surgery, we've been
living our best lives.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.625
She's so happy.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.888
I don't want to
take that from her.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.151
- I understand.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.501
- [groans]

12:48.245 --> 12:48.419
.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.117
- Free fluid and free air
in my abdomen?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.466
What does that mean?

12:51.509 --> 12:52.902
- That there's a hole
somewhere in your intestine

12:52.946 --> 12:55.296
or your stomach.
- From what?

12:55.339 --> 12:56.732
- Could be a perforated ulcer.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.647
It might be something
sharp that you swallowed.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.171
Honestly, I won't be sure
until I get in there.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.347
- Get in there?
You mean surgery?

13:03.391 --> 13:04.871
- Yeah.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.002
Leak in the GI tract needs
to be addressed immediately.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.178
- But he'll be all right?
- Yes.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.833
It's a routine operation.
There's a waiting room.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.530
We also have a café,
if you like.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.142
- I don't know.
I-- I want to be close.

13:15.185 --> 13:18.232
- Pam, honey, you know what?
Why don't you take a walk?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.886
You love this time of year,
nice weather.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.235
You can get your steps in.

13:21.278 --> 13:24.151
- I guess the fresh air
might do me some good.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.543
Quell the nerves.
[laughs]

13:25.587 --> 13:27.981
- Sure. OK.
So we're good here? Yeah?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.721
All right, well,
I'll change my scrubs,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.812
and I'll get the techs to bring
you upstairs to pre-op holding.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.725
- OK.
- OK?

13:33.769 --> 13:35.162
- Hi.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.728
- Sweetie, you need to let go.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.905
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:38.948 --> 13:39.993
- Don't worry.
We'll keep you updated

13:40.036 --> 13:41.733
throughout
the entire operation.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.996
- Thank you.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.562
- Oh, and another one--

13:44.606 --> 13:46.086
vaccines.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.174
You want to know
who they're helping,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.784
just look at the
sponsor behind it.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.352
- Hey, a lot of people have
problems with vaccines,

13:51.395 --> 13:52.919
you know?
It's a complicated issue.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.921
- Exactly.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.661
I didn't think
you would understand.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.054
- Really important for
somebody in my position

13:58.098 --> 13:59.447
to keep an open mind.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.536
- Refreshing.
[chuckles]

14:01.579 --> 14:04.844
- You know, Jan, I'm noticing
some skin discoloration.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.672
- Oh, it's just the
fluorescent lights in here.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.152
- You know, it could be.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.024
But it also might be jaundice.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.721
You mind if I just take
a tiny bit of blood,

14:12.764 --> 14:14.636
do a couple of very
simple blood tests?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.681
- Yes, I mind very much.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.553
- Got it.
Understood.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.729
You were saying?

14:20.772 --> 14:23.036
- Oh, HIV.
[scoffs]

14:23.079 --> 14:26.604
I read a very persuasive
article basically saying

14:26.648 --> 14:29.912
that they intentionally dusted
it over low-income communities

14:29.956 --> 14:32.915
as a form of
population control.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.482
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:34.525 --> 14:37.137
I mean, people wanted to blame
the Reagan administration,

14:37.180 --> 14:40.575
you know, the FBI,
but the research I've done

14:40.618 --> 14:42.272
points to the CIA.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.535
- What kind of research?
I'm just curious.

14:44.579 --> 14:47.799
- I mean, written literature,
podcasters, YouTubers.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.584
But I prefer online forums

14:49.627 --> 14:51.412
because people are always
sharing information.

14:51.455 --> 14:55.198
- So, um, I mean,
do you have, like a--

14:55.242 --> 14:57.984
a favorite forum
that you could show me?

14:58.027 --> 14:59.768
- Yeah, I don't know.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.292
- Look, I will draw
my own conclusions.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.990
It's just the more
up-to-the-minute stuff

15:04.033 --> 15:06.644
I have access to, the better.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.864
No big deal.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.083
- OK.
Um--

15:10.126 --> 15:12.259
[clears throat] All right.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.913
Look at this thread.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.916
It talks about the scanners
that they use in hospitals.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.352
- We're seeing that, yeah.

15:18.395 --> 15:22.530
- Mm-hmm. CTs, ultrasounds,
especially MRIs,

15:22.573 --> 15:25.925
and how they inject
dangerous hydrogen protons

15:25.968 --> 15:28.144
into the body.
- Wow.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.842
- Hospitals kill people.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.933
They kill them.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.980
OK.
We had a good chat, but...

15:38.024 --> 15:41.027
Look, you seem like
a nice guy, but I would, um,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.203
I would really like
to go home now.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.161
- Got it.
Um, let me just quickly

15:45.205 --> 15:46.206
go find somebody
to stitch you up.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.425
- No, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.732
- That's a deep wound, OK?

15:50.775 --> 15:52.516
I mean, we don't close it up,
it's going to keep bleeding.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.083
And what I really
don't want to happen

15:54.127 --> 15:55.824
is that it gets infected.
- No, no.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.130
I'll keep it clean.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.653
- You want to risk having
your hand infected?

15:58.696 --> 16:01.264
You could lose it.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.179
- OK.
Fine.

16:03.223 --> 16:07.270
But no scans, no IVs,
just a needle and thread.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.707
And then you let me go.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.754
- Deal.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.975
Back in a flash.
- [sighs]

16:16.018 --> 16:17.367
- Mags?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.021
- Yeah.
- Find Zack.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.023
Have him stitch up her hand.
- She's gonna let us treat her?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.720
- Just the hand,
not the jaundice.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.984
- Well, that's a start.
What about her mental state?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.724
- You know,
conspiracy theories

16:26.768 --> 16:29.031
are not necessarily connected
to any kind of

16:29.075 --> 16:30.467
paranoid personality disorder.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.991
I mean, certainly
not in Jan's case.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.688
- And she's what?
Just gullible?

16:33.731 --> 16:35.559
- I'd say more like
a combination of--

16:35.603 --> 16:38.258
I don't know--
lonely and prone to persuasion.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.173
I'm really starting to think
that something bad

16:40.216 --> 16:42.784
happened to her in a hospital.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.091
- That makes sense.
How do we get past that?

16:45.134 --> 16:46.614
Because I'm concerned
that her jaundice

16:46.657 --> 16:48.355
means that her liver's failing.
- Yeah, I mean, look.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.921
She wouldn't let me draw blood,
all right?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.532
Scans are out of the question.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.360
So I guess we're just going
to have to go with, you know,

16:53.403 --> 16:54.970
her medical history.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.450
- Well, we don't
even have that.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.800
We don't even have her name.
- It's Jacqueline Warner.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.193
She handed me her phone.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.933
- The settings trick
that I taught you.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.892
- Anyway, it's not
going to take Zack

17:03.935 --> 17:05.241
that long to stitch her up,

17:05.285 --> 17:06.721
but she's already asking
to leave, so--

17:06.763 --> 17:08.027
- Don't worry.
I'll buy you some time.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.854
- Thank you.
- Got you.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.728
- Vickie, Richard.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.165
- Dr. Marcel?
- Nice to see you both.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.428
- Yeah, it's nice
to see you too.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.820
- Yeah.
- I don't understand.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.257
You're a surgeon.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.347
You said it was just a sprain.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.222
Richard, what's going on?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.919
- The cancer's back, isn't it?

17:30.962 --> 17:32.616
- I'm afraid so.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.489
CT scan showed multiple
lesions in your liver.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.012
- So it metastasized.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.796
It spread from my pancreas.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.928
- Yes.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.278
- Richard.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.498
You knew something was wrong.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.195
Why didn't you tell me?

17:46.239 --> 17:47.936
- I wanted to.

17:47.979 --> 17:51.113
But I-- I also just
didn't wanna face it.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.463
[somber music]

17:53.507 --> 17:56.031
These last few months,

17:56.075 --> 17:59.904
the way you laugh
at my dumb jokes,

17:59.948 --> 18:04.213
burn my toast on the edges.

18:04.257 --> 18:08.130
I've fallen for you
all over again.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.827
- You beat cancer once.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.047
You can beat it again.
- No, honey.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.832
I'm a science guy.
The odds of that happening--

18:14.876 --> 18:16.573
- Are good.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.663
Richard,
OR 2.0 knows your body.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.491
It's been learning and
improving with every surgery

18:21.535 --> 18:23.363
it's done since yours.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.973
Now, don't get me wrong.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.281
This procedure you need now,
high-frequency ablation,

18:28.324 --> 18:30.457
it's a delicate operation.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
But 2.0 has all the tools.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.158
- But a--
a third lease on life?

18:36.202 --> 18:37.333
Really?

18:37.377 --> 18:40.945
- I believe so.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
- OK.
[chuckles]

18:43.078 --> 18:44.862
Let's do it again.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.082
- Good.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.737
- Thank you both.
- Yeah.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.521
- Here we go.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.394
Perforated ulcer
on the anterior surface

18:54.437 --> 18:57.310
of the first portion
of the duodenum.

18:57.353 --> 19:01.357
Got some undigested
food remnants, lavage.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.882
- Betcha it's corn
and green beans.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.580
[machinery beeping]

19:06.623 --> 19:08.190
- Close.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.323
Corn and cauliflower.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.194
- I was going to
say cauliflower.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.545
- All right.
Uh, suction, please.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.895
Let's move on
to the omental patch,

19:17.939 --> 19:19.680
3-0 silk suture.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.902
Whoa!

19:24.946 --> 19:27.253
- What the hell was that?
- That's a tapeworm.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.212
- Where the hell did it go?

19:30.256 --> 19:32.301
- That's a good question.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.998
Look at that.

19:38.264 --> 19:38.438
.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.136
- Booked the whole day for
one person's pacemaker?

19:41.180 --> 19:44.357
- Apparently, Jack has
decided to rent out OR 2.0.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.881
As long as you have the money,
you can reserve it

19:46.924 --> 19:48.796
for as long as you want.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.276
- I know this is unorthodox,

19:50.319 --> 19:52.887
but when Jack started
analyzing revenue streams--

19:52.930 --> 19:54.367
- No, he's selling seats
on a rocket ship,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.847
making up rules only his
rich pals can play by.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.285
- OK. Right now, I need
a solution for my patient.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.547
Rich is ready for surgery,

20:00.590 --> 20:01.896
and this other guy
is still in Colorado.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.115
- And my priority
is patient care,

20:04.159 --> 20:06.074
and I'm not going to
have an operating room

20:06.117 --> 20:07.945
held hostage by Jack Dayton.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.382
Start your surgery.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.080
- Wait. Just hold on.
Jack's already made it clear

20:12.123 --> 20:15.866
that he's no longer
subsidizing 2.0.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.955
[sighs]
We sure Evans can pay?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.087
- Are you kidding me?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.871
We're talking about
a man's life.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.743
- Dr. Halstead,
the way I see it,

20:22.786 --> 20:25.528
Mr. Evans's initial surgery
was pro bono,

20:25.572 --> 20:28.531
so we can consider this
a necessary follow-up

20:28.575 --> 20:29.880
and forgive the bill.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.882
Start your surgery, Dr. Marcel.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.015
- Thank you.
- You know, Jack's ideas,

20:34.058 --> 20:35.582
chasing profits
for the hospital,

20:35.625 --> 20:37.192
it only widens the gap.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.020
It's not right.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.413
- Wow.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.066
I got to let Jack know
what's going on.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.460
- No, no, no, no.
You let me tell him myself.

20:44.504 --> 20:49.117
We're going to keep this line
of communication direct.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.903
[elevator beeps]

20:52.947 --> 20:56.298
- Dr. Charles, Zack's
finished stitching Jan up.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
And I've stalled
all that I can.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.214
She's antsy,
and she wants out of here.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.998
- OK, well,
I'm starting to see why.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.913
Nothing glaring
in Jan's chart,

21:02.957 --> 21:06.308
but it turns out her sister,
Deborah, was seen at East Mercy

21:06.352 --> 21:08.963
right before the pandemic
for a broken arm.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.314
Upon examination, they discover
aggressive pancreatic cancer.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.142
She's dead in a month.

21:14.185 --> 21:17.928
- So in Jan's mind, her sister
went into the hospital healthy,

21:17.972 --> 21:19.626
had a bunch
of scanning tests,

21:19.669 --> 21:21.410
and came out with
a terminal disease?

21:21.454 --> 21:22.585
- Exactly.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.935
She has this sudden
catastrophic loss,

21:24.979 --> 21:27.982
and she's furious and
looking for someone to blame.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.549
- Oh, my God.

21:29.592 --> 21:33.857
Jaundice is a symptom
of pancreatic cancer.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.946
Isn't it hereditary?
- Yes.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.513
And it was killing her sister

21:37.557 --> 21:39.080
before she even knew
she had it.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.951
Same thing could be
happening to Jan.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.649
- She needs a full workup now.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.172
What are we going to do?
- OK, look.

21:44.215 --> 21:46.653
I'm going to dive back into
these sites, these forums,

21:46.696 --> 21:49.220
see if I can find something
that we can connect on.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.613
In the meantime,
start the discharge,

21:50.657 --> 21:51.875
but slow roll it for me.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.834
- OK.
Work fast.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.184
[soft tense music]

21:56.227 --> 21:57.968
- All right, Trini, I'm back.
What do we got?

21:58.012 --> 22:00.231
- Nothing.
- Seriously?

22:00.275 --> 22:01.668
- Since we stopped taking
walk-ins without insurance,

22:01.711 --> 22:03.191
numbers are down.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.888
- Well, we can't do that.
It's illegal.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.237
- [sighs]
I don't know.

22:06.281 --> 22:09.197
I guess we're only taking
true emergencies now.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.593
- I know you've been
waiting a long time.

22:13.636 --> 22:14.855
And I'm sorry, sir.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.727
They'll be able to help you
at East Mercy.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.862
- We turning him away because
he doesn't have insurance?

22:21.905 --> 22:24.038
- Yeah.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.909
- Excuse me, sir.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.476
I'm Dr. Halstead.
What's going on?

22:27.520 --> 22:30.044
- Gout's flaring up again.

22:30.087 --> 22:33.264
- I'm sorry.
I know that's painful.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.704
How about your chest?
Any pain?

22:37.747 --> 22:39.662
- What?
No.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.838
- Are you sure?
'Cause if you do,

22:41.882 --> 22:43.492
well, that'd be considered
an emergency,

22:43.536 --> 22:46.887
and we'd have
to treat you here.

22:46.930 --> 22:50.543
So no chest pain?

22:50.586 --> 22:55.548
- I might have a slight
feeling of tightness.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.420
- Well, in that case,
let's get you checked out.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.164
- OK, what do you feel?

23:03.207 --> 23:05.949
We got grilled cheese,
dim sum, pizza.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.038
- Any of them.
I'm starving.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.344
I had to fast
for the blood test,

23:09.388 --> 23:12.086
then no time to eat
before the scans started.

23:12.129 --> 23:13.696
- Any idea when
the results come in?

23:13.740 --> 23:15.306
- Well, they said
a couple of days.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.830
Probably going to feel
like weeks though.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.353
- Mm-hmm.
[woman screaming]

23:18.397 --> 23:19.572
- Oh, my God.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.225
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.010
- Are you hurt? What--
- I--I don't know.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.186
I was just walking, and then
all of a sudden my stomach--

23:25.229 --> 23:26.492
[screams, sobs]
- OK, all right.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.581
Help me get her to the bench.
What's your name?

23:28.624 --> 23:30.931
- Pam.
- Pam, I'm Dr. Asher.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.149
That's Sean.
- Thank you.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.847
- Is it OK
if I feel your belly?

23:33.890 --> 23:35.022
- Yes.
- Yeah? OK.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.894
- My--my husband's
in surgery right now

23:37.938 --> 23:39.461
for a hole in his intestine.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.507
Could I-- could I
have the same thing?

23:41.550 --> 23:43.465
[screams] Sorry.
- OK.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.685
- It's OK.
Squeeze as hard as you like.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.687
- [groaning]

23:47.730 --> 23:49.210
Oh, God.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.299
I'm sorry.
I just peed myself.

23:51.342 --> 23:52.779
- Oh, no, Pam.
That's not urine.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.607
Your uterus is
enlarged and firm.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.260
Your water just broke.
You're in labor.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.698
- What?
I'm pregnant?

23:58.741 --> 24:01.875
- I'm sorry.
You didn't-- you didn't know?

24:01.918 --> 24:04.355
Wow, OK, so I imagine
you have a lot of questions.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.227
But right now,
we need to get you inside.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.837
- I'll get a wheelchair.
- Wait. I'm scared.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.623
I need to hold on to someone,
and my husband's in the--

24:10.666 --> 24:12.146
- I'll step in for him,
if you'd like.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.452
- Thank you.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.193
- OK. I'll go get
that wheelchair.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.979
- I see.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.372
Oh, lost it.
Damn it.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.505
- Uh, this a
cause-and-effect thing?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.507
Tapeworm lead to the ulcer?

24:25.551 --> 24:26.943
- No.

24:26.987 --> 24:30.294
Ulcer's usually from
the H. pylori bacteria--

24:30.338 --> 24:33.167
super common,
almost all of us have it.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.517
Tapeworm's from a bad meal.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.825
- [chuckles]
I'm never eating again.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.740
- Gotcha.
Ha ha.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.306
- Wife's not picking up.

24:42.350 --> 24:45.919
- Leave your number.
Ask her to text you.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.096
Pull this out slowly.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.185
Tapeworms regenerate.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.753
Don't want this
breaking off on me.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.668
- Uh, how long
do you think it is?

24:55.711 --> 24:57.191
- No idea.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.020
But I can't wait to find out.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.501
- Need some help in here!

25:02.544 --> 25:03.850
Move it.
- Where?

25:03.893 --> 25:05.852
- Anywhere but here, Mike.
- What happened?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.418
- They took an X-ray
in the treatment room

25:07.462 --> 25:08.855
next door and it set her off.
- I heard them.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.031
They said X-ray.
And then someone yelled, clear.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.859
See, they're admitting
the radiation is bad for you.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.121
And these blankets
are not enough.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.383
- OK. I'm sorry.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.471
But we got rid
of the X-ray machine.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.646
- Well, Dr. Charles
said I could go,

25:17.690 --> 25:19.256
so I'm leaving right now.
- Jacqueline--

25:19.300 --> 25:21.389
- What?
How do you know my name?

25:21.432 --> 25:23.565
- Oh, I can explain.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.263
- No. Forget it.
I don't trust any of you.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.004
- [sighs]

25:28.048 --> 25:30.224
We know about your sister
and her cancer.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.878
- Yeah,
that the hospitals gave her

25:31.921 --> 25:34.576
with their X-rays
and their CTs and their MRIs.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.447
Those scans killed her!
- It's not true.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.058
Deborah had cancer before
she went to the hospital.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.407
- No.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.887
- Her death had nothing
to do with the test.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.498
It was genetic.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.673
That's why we need you
to get tested too.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.022
- No.
You stay away from me.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.198
You have all been lying to me
since I got here.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.678
- That's not true.
We've been trying to help you.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.551
- Then let me go!
- Maggie, just a word.

25:52.594 --> 25:53.943
Be right back.
- I'm done here.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.076

I'll walk you out myself.

Mags?

25:58.295 --> 25:59.601
What are you doing?

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
- We've got to get through
to her somehow.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.170
- Reinforcing her
paranoid fantasies

26:03.213 --> 26:04.475
is not the way to do that.

26:04.519 --> 26:07.391

cancer, Dr. Charles.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.176
She needs to get screened.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.481
- Well, of course she does.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.048
But it's got to be her decision
to do that.

26:12.092 --> 26:15.704
- Well, we know that's never
going to happen, don't we?

26:18.707 --> 26:22.711
- Yeah, it's a safe bet this
is why Tim was shedding weight.

26:22.755 --> 26:25.322

- No.
Still MIA.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.417
- I don't get it.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.637
So worried about
Tim having surgery.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.421

- One last push!

the hows and whys later, Pam.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.316
Right now, I need you to focus.

27:02.359 --> 27:03.534

another contraction.

27:03.578 --> 27:04.971

Ready, Pam?

there's much more.

is he still in surgery?

of the lesions.

Calculating.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.431

to the next lesion.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.475

All 6 feet, 4 inches of it.

- YOLO?
You Only Live Once?

29:22.412 --> 29:23.936

29:23.979 --> 29:26.590
Nine months ago, Pam and I
went to Thailand for our 10th.

29:26.634 --> 29:29.158
I was all over
those street carts.

29:29.202 --> 29:32.118
Pork, chicken, fish, insects.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.423
I probably picked up
that tapeworm

29:33.467 --> 29:34.816
somewhere in that smorgasbord.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.426
- Perhaps.

29:36.470 --> 29:37.993
Although, tapeworms
only take two months

29:38.037 --> 29:40.517
to reach adult size,
so it's possible

29:40.561 --> 29:43.042
that you were infected
more recently.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.305
Same thing goes for
the H. pylori bacteria

29:45.348 --> 29:47.176
that caused your ulcer.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.178
Could've have happened
any time, any place.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.919
- So the two aren't connected?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.268
- Well, not medically.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.531
But tapeworms can go
undetected for years.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.272
So if you hadn't
developed an ulcer

29:56.316 --> 29:58.361
which required surgery,
then who knows how long

29:58.405 --> 30:01.016
it would've taken
to discover it?

30:01.060 --> 30:02.409

lucky day, then, huh?

30:02.452 --> 30:03.932
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

30:03.976 --> 30:05.412

30:05.455 --> 30:07.240

30:07.283 --> 30:09.155
pretty sure you didn't bring
anything back in you,

that your wife

I haven't lost any weight.

couldn't ever get pregnant.

it wasn't that long ago
that doctors actually thought
