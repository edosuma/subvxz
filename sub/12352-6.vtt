00:00.400 --> 00:01.633
Previously on Greek:

00:04.187 --> 00:08.957
Spitter and Pledge Spidey have
successfully stolen the A&M goat!

00:09.684 --> 00:11.087
Are you trying to seduce me again?

00:11.088 --> 00:13.110
I hear it's even better the second time.

00:13.845 --> 00:16.911
Laura, I enjoy our time together,
but I don't wanna hide it.

00:16.912 --> 00:19.160
- I wanna take it outside the pantry.
- No.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.192
The minute we fight with KT, you

00:21.193 --> 00:23.871
help your boyfriend Heath and
his friends humiliate us.

00:23.872 --> 00:25.825
- That is not what I intended.
- You guys are cool?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.384
They let me resign to avoid impeachment.

00:27.385 --> 00:28.022
It's gonna take some time

00:28.023 --> 00:30.008
to get back in their good
graces, but I'm working on it.

00:30.009 --> 00:31.633
Thousands of people graduated in May,

00:31.634 --> 00:32.936
and none of us are owed anything.

00:32.937 --> 00:34.622
You have to think
short-term as well as long.

00:34.623 --> 00:36.641
Every time I get rejected
from yet another job,

00:36.642 --> 00:37.670
- I think about it.
- I can't believe

00:37.671 --> 00:38.922
I wasted my time trying to help you.

00:38.923 --> 00:41.156
- Then go!
- Can I buy you a drink?

00:41.157 --> 00:43.318
- I would love one, professor.
- Call me Simon.

00:47.287 --> 00:49.292
- What are we doing? What is this?
- It's a fairy tale.

00:52.161 --> 00:55.264
Wake up, Titans, this is 89.1 FM.

00:55.265 --> 00:59.000
It's Homecoming Day here at CRU,
and do we have a game for you,

00:59.065 --> 01:02.058
as the Titans take on the A&M Farmhands!

01:02.059 --> 01:03.995
To say that these two teams have a past,

01:03.996 --> 01:05.819
whoa, that's an understatement.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.912
Kickoff just three hours...

01:07.566 --> 01:08.994
Touchdown!

01:11.848 --> 01:12.995
Oh! Hey, Cap.

01:12.996 --> 01:15.569
Why have we never had a
slumber party at ZBZ before?

01:16.004 --> 01:20.720
This duvet? Heavenly.
And the bathroom, no mold.

01:23.282 --> 01:25.095
Please tell me no one saw you.

01:25.296 --> 01:26.963
Don't worry, I was stealthy.

01:27.158 --> 01:28.380
And it was only number one.

01:28.726 --> 01:31.672
- And I wiped the seat.
- Surprisingly thoughtful.

01:34.054 --> 01:35.707
Ash didn't come home last night.

01:35.708 --> 01:37.451
Well, she would have gotten quite a show.

01:37.602 --> 01:39.532
Especially around 3:00, 3:15.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.502
I didn't know my body bent that way.

01:42.729 --> 01:44.833
Oh! OK. You've got to get dressed.

01:46.142 --> 01:46.893
If you get out of here now,

01:46.894 --> 01:48.579
then Ash will never know we slept together.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.357
She'll just misinterpret everything

01:50.358 --> 01:52.181
and think that we're getting back together.

01:52.182 --> 01:54.641
Would that be such a bad thing?
It's what the people want.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.374
Cap, I'm so sorry,

01:58.122 --> 01:59.663
but last night doesn't change things.

01:59.973 --> 02:02.208
We're still the same people
with the same issues.

02:03.647 --> 02:07.913
OK. Well, thanks for the
evening of meaningless sex.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.686
I shall now commence my walk of shame.

02:10.687 --> 02:12.772
Great, um, but can you make it a leap?

02:15.191 --> 02:15.767
Thanks.

02:17.391 --> 02:19.875
- Is this safe? Ah!
- OK.

02:36.071 --> 02:38.186
Rusty? Rusty.

02:39.174 --> 02:41.147
- You OK?
- What?

02:52.964 --> 02:54.799
Looks like you had quite the night.

03:00.872 --> 03:03.974
- What happened?
- This shirt chafes my nipples.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.643
What's on your face?

03:05.677 --> 03:09.046
Man, did Beaver find out
where I hid the markers?

03:11.750 --> 03:15.601
Well, I either kissed a girl or
gave a clown mouth-to-mouth.

03:18.385 --> 03:20.360
- You don't remember?
- I blacked out.

03:23.228 --> 03:24.013
Oh. What the hell?

03:24.014 --> 03:26.308
Please tell me there were
no clowns at this party.

03:26.309 --> 03:30.235
No clowns. Just a goat and two heroes.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.170
Rusty, thanks to that goat,

03:33.171 --> 03:36.006
I made out with a Titan cheerleader!
A cheerleader!

03:36.041 --> 03:37.578
Well, she's a base in the pyramid,

03:37.579 --> 03:39.343
but she's still a solid seven. A seven!

03:39.377 --> 03:41.245
This totally makes up for missing prom.

03:43.381 --> 03:45.382
Please. I'm very happy for you.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.682
Just no loud and sudden movements, OK?

03:47.958 --> 03:51.060
Rusty, if I smooched a seven,
your girl must have been a ten.

04:21.772 --> 04:23.398
Rusty, what are you doing out here?

04:23.667 --> 04:27.077
Just resting my eyes.
What are you doing in here?

04:27.540 --> 04:29.469
- You don't remember?
- Why?

04:29.808 --> 04:33.577
Did I do something stupid?
Please tell me I didn't break dance.

04:33.612 --> 04:35.351
No. Casey and I got in a fight and

04:35.352 --> 04:38.115
you said I could crash here
while I find my own place.

04:38.149 --> 04:40.451
- But if that's not OK...
- No, that's OK.

04:40.485 --> 04:43.487
What was the fight about?
Did you eat in her car?

04:43.521 --> 04:46.357
- I've been there.
- No.

04:46.391 --> 04:49.760
Um, just life stuff.
I'll tell you about it later.

04:49.794 --> 04:52.896
But right now I need to go pack.
So, thanks.

04:59.537 --> 05:00.468
Oh, my life...

05:04.409 --> 05:06.101
Hey, Rusty, thanks for the heads

05:06.102 --> 05:07.845
up that Ashleigh was sleeping on the couch.

05:07.879 --> 05:09.169
I got up last night to
get a drink of water,

05:09.170 --> 05:10.896
and she saw my full monty
in the fridge light.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.817
I'm so sorry.
I was really drunk last night.

05:13.852 --> 05:16.153
I know. I have the voicemails to prove it.

05:16.187 --> 05:18.380
- What are you talking about?
- You wanna hear 'em?

05:18.520 --> 05:19.203
No.

05:21.459 --> 05:25.129
Hey, Dale, it's R-r-r-rusty!

05:25.163 --> 05:26.212
I got your goat.

05:29.734 --> 05:32.803
You get it? 'Cause usually that
phrase is used in situations

05:32.837 --> 05:33.879
that have nothing to do with goats.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.687
But this time I've actually got your goat!

05:36.688 --> 05:39.543
Dale, why are you not at this party?

05:39.577 --> 05:41.339
You have "Goat" To check it out.

05:42.585 --> 05:44.140
Enjoy your 15 minutes, Rusty.

05:49.688 --> 05:53.839
Hey, Calvin, I'd stop and talk,
but I'm making a dramatic exit.

05:59.764 --> 06:03.333
- What was that about?
- He's upset that I got his goat.

06:05.055 --> 06:05.985
See? It's funny.

06:05.986 --> 06:09.573
- What's with the eye wear, Snooki?
- I found these at the house.

06:09.607 --> 06:11.608
The sun's killing my eyes.

06:11.643 --> 06:13.610
I think I turned into a vampire last night.

06:13.645 --> 06:15.019
I don't remember anything.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.710
But I have this feeling that

06:16.711 --> 06:19.104
something really good
happened to me last night.

06:19.951 --> 06:23.353
- And something really bad.
- You wanna veg here,

06:23.388 --> 06:25.789
uh, watch the game, order a pizza?

06:25.824 --> 06:27.344
Maybe something will come to you.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.692
You're not going to the game?

06:28.727 --> 06:30.294
Well, you know, we haven't
hung out in a while.

06:30.328 --> 06:31.894
So I thought it might be fun to catch up.

06:32.864 --> 06:34.298
Come on, you love football games.

06:34.332 --> 06:36.767
Yeah, but my seats were
with my Omega Chi brothers.

06:36.801 --> 06:39.036
And I could just use a day
away from fraternity today.

06:39.070 --> 06:42.639
- You "Goat" it.
- OK, I'm calling it. No more goat jokes.

06:46.077 --> 06:47.478
You're calling me.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.456
Hey, Katherine, I am so sorry I am late!

06:59.491 --> 07:01.458
But I have a really good excuse.

07:01.493 --> 07:05.362
I was in this half marathon this
morning and this guy ahead of me

07:05.396 --> 07:08.098
started to have a heart attack
so I had to give him, um, CPR.

07:08.133 --> 07:11.635
And it just took forever to get a pulse!

07:13.905 --> 07:15.305
- Katherine?
- Hm?

07:15.340 --> 07:18.509
Oh, um, I'm so sorry, Casey.

07:18.543 --> 07:21.845
I'm just a little distracted this
morning with a personal dilemma.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.649
- You see, I've taken a lover.
- My, how classy.

07:25.683 --> 07:27.360
I've read enough Victorian
literature to know

07:27.361 --> 07:29.037
that I cannot afford to be careless
or the next thing you know

07:29.038 --> 07:30.575
I'll be out on the street
begging for tuppence

07:30.576 --> 07:31.886
to feed my bastard love child.

07:32.772 --> 07:35.924
So you and your stable
boy need birth control?

07:35.925 --> 07:37.950
He's not a stable boy, Casey.

07:37.951 --> 07:39.497
In fact, he wants to be
a kindergarten teacher.

07:40.183 --> 07:42.546
Wait. Beaver?

07:42.547 --> 07:44.241
His given name is Walter, but yes.

07:44.242 --> 07:45.594
We made a connection
during our night in Rio.

07:45.595 --> 07:48.134
But do not worry, we
have been using condoms.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.337
- Yay!
- So many condoms.

07:52.024 --> 07:53.754
The thing is, I would prefer to

07:53.755 --> 07:56.092
have a second layer of
defense, one that I control.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.268
Yeah. So, um, wait, you're
sleeping with Beaver,

08:00.269 --> 08:02.004
and his name is Walter?

08:02.005 --> 08:03.785
Casey, can you please stay
focused on the issue at hand?

08:03.786 --> 08:05.781
All right, all right. Which is...?

08:05.782 --> 08:08.791
- Birth control pills or the vaginal ring?
- Oh. Wow, the v-word.

08:09.060 --> 08:10.227
I have a prescriptions for both,

08:10.228 --> 08:12.162
then I did my research, and
now I need to choose one.

08:12.197 --> 08:13.556
The pill will regulate my menstrual cycle,

08:13.557 --> 08:14.398
but with the vaginal ring,

08:14.432 --> 08:15.866
I do not have to swallow pharmaceuticals.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.168
Which is fantastic 'cause
I've notice that I recently

08:18.203 --> 08:20.871
have a horrible kind of a gagging reflex.

08:20.905 --> 08:22.284
What do you use?

08:25.376 --> 08:28.111
Well, I was on the pill.
Then when Cappie and I broke up

08:28.146 --> 08:29.963
I went off it because it
just made me so bloated.

08:30.493 --> 08:32.298
Better bloated than pregnant.

08:33.618 --> 08:35.666
Anyway, enough of my prattling.
Shall we dive in?

08:41.092 --> 08:42.491
Let's get my phone and
let's get out of here.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.648
All right, all right! Listen up, everybody!

08:52.071 --> 08:56.830
Last night, this man stole a
goat and made Titan history!

09:00.549 --> 09:03.555
Hey! No! He's got a hangover.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.949
It's like going to the
mall with Justin Bieber.

09:07.927 --> 09:10.658
It is an honor to shake your hand,
my friend. You're a legend.

09:10.659 --> 09:13.382
A legend? No. What does that even mean?

09:13.383 --> 09:15.709
- OK. Let's just get your phone.
- Right, right.

09:16.127 --> 09:18.763
Here you go, man.
You know, you left your coat here, too.

09:19.729 --> 09:22.588
Oh, thank you. Hey. OK, there's got to be

09:22.589 --> 09:24.890
some evidence on here of
what happened last night.

09:27.569 --> 09:30.344
- Who's that?
- I don't know. She looks pretty.

09:30.345 --> 09:32.686
No, she is blonde and a mouth.

09:32.687 --> 09:35.494
She could be the good thing
that happened to me last night.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.694
I woke up with lipstick all over my face.

09:37.695 --> 09:39.623
I hate to remind you that you
just broke up with Dana,

09:39.624 --> 09:42.167
but, man, this has rebound
written all over it.

09:42.168 --> 09:44.248
Remember that green girl from Comic-Con?

09:44.568 --> 09:45.772
I'm still embarrassed for you.

09:46.248 --> 09:47.488
This is different. I know

09:47.489 --> 09:49.073
I kissed the girl of my dreams last night.

09:49.253 --> 09:50.542
OK, how are we gonna find

09:50.543 --> 09:53.255
this magical mystery mouth?
We have no clues.

09:53.463 --> 09:56.758
Not so fast, we have a... flash drive?

09:57.107 --> 09:58.800
Ooh, maybe she's a Russian spy.

10:00.405 --> 10:04.080
- Her name's Carol.
- Or a local librarian.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.249
- We need to talk. - You can't stop
thinking about last night either?

10:16.250 --> 10:19.743
- I keep replaying it over and over again.
- Me, too.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.891
- What was your favorite part?
- What?

10:21.892 --> 10:25.104
No, I'm trying to remember
if we used a condom.

10:26.427 --> 10:27.182
Let me check.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.772
Well, I've still got Ol' Yeller.
Looks like we went commando.

10:34.107 --> 10:35.622
That's what I was afraid of.

10:35.981 --> 10:38.439
Hey, what's the big deal?
I just got tested, you're on the pill.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.512
Not anymore.

10:43.165 --> 10:46.128
Well... I did not know that.

10:46.129 --> 10:47.937
- Oh, so this is my fault?
- No, you know what?

10:47.938 --> 10:50.552
Let's take a deep, cleansing breath, OK?

10:54.325 --> 10:56.998
We don't even know if anything happened...

10:57.510 --> 11:00.934
- ...in there. - Well, we both know
that I could be pregnant.

11:00.935 --> 11:04.345
You could be the p-word,
but you're probably not.

11:04.346 --> 11:06.680
- But I could be.
- But you're probably not.

11:07.043 --> 11:08.993
OK, you know what?
Forget I even said anything.

11:09.371 --> 11:12.269
After all, it's my problem, not yours.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.812
We're 30 minutes away from kickoff
and the name of the game today

11:24.847 --> 11:27.081
is defense, defense, defense.

11:27.116 --> 11:30.384
- Yes, how can I help you?
- Hm, where to begin?

11:30.419 --> 11:31.878
Well, I got into this huge fight

11:31.879 --> 11:33.178
with my best friend Ashleigh last night...

11:33.179 --> 11:36.203
- And then you had unprotected sex.
- Yes.

11:36.204 --> 11:38.345
Not with her... How did you know?

11:38.346 --> 11:40.240
That's where all these stories end.

11:41.236 --> 11:44.773
Well, I was hoping that you carry, um,

11:45.195 --> 11:48.638
that pill you can take, you
know, the morning after.

11:48.947 --> 11:50.115
The Morning-After Pill?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.512
I just need 30 bucks and an ID.

11:55.878 --> 11:59.680
Now, you might experience
some mild side effects:

11:59.715 --> 12:03.751
- headaches, dizziness, nausea.
- I'm way ahead of you.

12:03.786 --> 12:04.519
Casey?

12:06.940 --> 12:08.198
- Katherine?
- You'll be happy to know

12:08.199 --> 12:09.540
that after our chat this morning,

12:09.541 --> 12:11.591
I've decided to go on the pill.
Gag reflex be damned.

12:11.592 --> 12:13.678
So I'm just here to pick
up my prescription.

12:14.744 --> 12:17.020
- Yay, birth control.
- I know.

12:17.299 --> 12:20.234
I was just... I was here...
I was just, um...

12:20.269 --> 12:22.307
Perhaps you'd like me to ring up your

12:22.308 --> 12:25.173
friend while you finish
testing out reading glasses?

12:25.207 --> 12:28.309
Oh, yes. Of course.

12:28.343 --> 12:31.415
Law school is really giving
the ol' peepers a workout.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.840
Prescription for Parker,
comma, Katherine. With a K.

12:40.422 --> 12:43.558
- Now, these pills take three weeks...
- To become effective.

12:43.592 --> 12:44.890
I've read all the literature online,

12:44.891 --> 12:46.694
I feel well-versed in the side effects.
Thank you.

12:46.728 --> 12:50.131
- Wow. You're very prepared.
- Well, I'm also not an idiot.

12:50.165 --> 12:52.834
Like Whitney Houston, I believe
that children are the future.

12:52.868 --> 12:53.950
It's just a far distant future

12:53.951 --> 12:55.503
after I've made partner. Am I right, Casey?

12:55.537 --> 12:57.371
Yes, that is the plan.

12:57.406 --> 13:00.041
No, and our kids can have play dates.

13:00.075 --> 13:03.077
- My God, I think my little Anastasia
would love that. - Oh, my God!

13:03.111 --> 13:05.513
- So I'll call you. I'll pencil it in.
- Yes!

13:07.301 --> 13:08.950
Thank you for your help here today.

13:08.984 --> 13:12.386
- I'm gonna have so much fun tonight. Bye!
- Ooh! Bye!

13:13.856 --> 13:14.539
Ok...

13:17.025 --> 13:19.416
Everybody gets one.
And it goes in your mouth,

13:19.417 --> 13:21.028
not the floor or the furniture.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.421
You have five minutes to

13:24.422 --> 13:26.000
go upstairs and get yourself presentable.

13:26.034 --> 13:29.237
Everyone is checked in, and I'm
ready to hand this thing over.

13:29.271 --> 13:32.661
- Hand what over? - We're baby-sitting
faculty kids during the game

13:32.662 --> 13:34.546
to score philanthropy points for the house.

13:34.910 --> 13:37.378
Because it's nice and whatever.
Did I forget to tell you?

13:37.412 --> 13:40.171
Yes. But it looks like
you've got it under control,

13:40.172 --> 13:41.849
so here's your pat on the back.

13:42.246 --> 13:44.285
Casey, you of all people should know

13:44.319 --> 13:47.189
that as president, my job
is strategic planning.

13:47.190 --> 13:48.923
Execution is up to the staff.

13:48.957 --> 13:51.615
- You, Dale, Laura.
- I'm not staff,

13:51.616 --> 13:53.209
Rebecca. I'm philanthropy chair.

13:53.485 --> 13:54.573
Right. My bad.

13:55.931 --> 13:59.433
At least you get a paycheck.
Tick-tock, four and a half minutes.

14:11.036 --> 14:12.036
Hello?

14:21.023 --> 14:22.316
Are you Carol?

14:26.295 --> 14:28.562
I'm Tawny. That's Carol.

14:30.132 --> 14:33.100
Yeah. That looks like a Carol.

14:33.511 --> 14:35.855
Goat boy! Life of the party!

14:36.598 --> 14:40.511
- We partied together?
- I was the party photographer.

14:40.953 --> 14:44.141
You really don't remember?
You were in practically every shot.

14:44.142 --> 14:46.828
Everything about last
night was a little hazy.

14:47.036 --> 14:48.766
Including why I have this.

14:49.307 --> 14:53.530
So first you stole the A&M goat,
then you steal my flash drive.

14:55.575 --> 14:58.478
Dude, you're a legend! Wait here.

14:58.738 --> 15:00.885
I wanna take your pic and put
it on my celebrity wall.

15:01.063 --> 15:02.530
Right next to Gary Coleman,

15:02.957 --> 15:04.200
God rest his tiny soul.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.894
So this appears to be a dead end.

15:10.212 --> 15:12.386
What do you say we go back to
your couch and watch the game?

15:12.387 --> 15:15.275
Not so fast. The girl I kissed had
to be at the party last night.

15:15.276 --> 15:18.008
- So was half the university.
- He was the only photographer.

15:18.009 --> 15:19.732
And he just said I'm in almost every pic.

15:28.223 --> 15:30.691
Don't worry, I'm about to leave.

15:30.726 --> 15:33.127
My awesome future awaits.

15:40.669 --> 15:41.787
For someone who wants me gone so bad,

15:41.788 --> 15:43.092
you could at least get out of my way.

15:44.183 --> 15:46.866
- Where are you headed?
- None of your beeswax.

15:48.043 --> 15:49.640
OK, well, just, you know,

15:49.641 --> 15:52.580
don't blame me if someone
steals your InStyle.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.932
Fine, I'm staying over at Rusty's
till I find my own place.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.618
Rusty's? Ash, wait.

15:58.619 --> 16:01.160
Case, you really hurt my feelings.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.111
And a simple apology isn't gonna fix this.

16:10.866 --> 16:13.467
Well, don't forget your flat iron.

16:13.502 --> 16:16.170
You can't have a serious job
search with frizzy hair.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.662
That would be great.
OK, I'll be right back.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.181
Ash, are you OK?
You look like you're about to fly coach.

16:53.182 --> 16:55.351
I'm fine. I just gotta get out of here.

16:55.525 --> 16:57.254
OK, but you're still my
date to the game, right?

16:57.810 --> 16:58.738
I'll meet you there.

17:00.273 --> 17:00.964
Ashleigh?

17:03.193 --> 17:05.772
- Professor Segal.
- Come on. I think after last night,

17:05.773 --> 17:09.156
- you can call me Simon.
- You look like Beyonce.

17:09.309 --> 17:10.050
Thank you.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.367
That is the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

17:13.368 --> 17:15.281
- Ashleigh, this is my daughter, Hailey.
- Hi.

17:15.282 --> 17:18.634
- Hi.
- I'm gonna check out the snack situation.

17:19.190 --> 17:21.767
OK. I'll be right there, sweetie.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.066
- All right.
- So you have a daughter?

17:24.741 --> 17:26.955
Yeah. I also have an ex-wife.

17:28.642 --> 17:29.994
I thought you graduated.

17:30.013 --> 17:33.299
I did. I was just crashing here with Casey.

17:33.618 --> 17:36.435
She's the house mother, and
it's a long, boring story.

17:36.436 --> 17:38.754
I can't imagine there's anything
about you that's boring.

17:49.731 --> 17:52.533
And that's the kick-off.
Hold on to your seats, folks.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.401
Things are just getting started.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.613
- Oh, my God.
- It's like watching Bizarro Rusty.

18:06.681 --> 18:09.216
Whoa, wait a minute. Go back.

18:09.527 --> 18:11.816
Deirdre and Jasmine?
If you kissed one of them,

18:12.102 --> 18:14.768
then we need to get you
to Student Health ASAP.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.535
Katherine.

18:19.394 --> 18:21.061
I must've kissed Katherine last night.

18:21.096 --> 18:23.464
The Farmhands have come out so strong,

18:23.498 --> 18:26.167
they're already knocking
on the Titan's front door.

18:27.836 --> 18:31.105
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- It's really not a good time, Cap.

18:31.139 --> 18:33.741
- It'll just take a second.
- What is it?

18:33.775 --> 18:36.377
Look, I'm really sorry for
freaking out on you earlier.

18:36.411 --> 18:39.947
- It's no big deal, Cap.
- But if you are...

18:39.981 --> 18:43.817
...the p-word, then we'll
deal with this together.

18:44.592 --> 18:47.822
Really? Because you can't
even say the word.

18:50.832 --> 18:52.507
I'm listening. Yes?

18:53.462 --> 18:56.248
Pregnant! See?

18:56.464 --> 18:58.465
OK. Well, you know what?
Everything's fine, Cap.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.836
- I took the Morning-After Pill.
- Oh, thank God.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.178
What's the Morning-After Pill?

19:13.718 --> 19:16.951
I bet you can't count all the
cats in this room over here.

19:16.952 --> 19:19.302
OK, uh, the game has started.
You should just go.

19:19.303 --> 19:22.277
- You sure you're OK?
- I'm hung over, hormonal

19:22.278 --> 19:24.761
and surrounded by screaming
children, so no.

19:24.762 --> 19:26.155
Then let me stay and help.

19:26.156 --> 19:28.068
Our house needs philanthropy
hours, anyways.

19:28.069 --> 19:30.346
Thanks, but these kids
need adult supervision.

19:30.347 --> 19:31.246
You know what?
I've seen

19:31.247 --> 19:33.172
Adventures In Babysitting, like, 19 times.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.904
OK? I can handle these kids way

19:34.905 --> 19:37.311
better than Elisabeth
Shue handled her career.

19:37.459 --> 19:40.129
OK, fine, just man the
arts and crafts table.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.291
But don't sniff the markers.

19:55.003 --> 19:55.929
What a play!

19:56.074 --> 19:58.015
- Oh! Yeah.
- I can't believe he caught that.

19:58.408 --> 20:00.232
Touchdown for the Titans.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.683
Look at how crowded the stands are.

20:02.684 --> 20:04.483
Good thing we're here with all this space.

20:06.811 --> 20:10.711
- Katherine? - No. She must be
in a marathon study session.

20:11.889 --> 20:14.789
So she handed you her virginity
on a silver platter,

20:14.790 --> 20:16.704
and you just sent it back to the kitchen.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.072
Why would she, all of a sudden,
give you a second chance?

20:20.073 --> 20:22.506
Because that goat made me a legend.

20:22.507 --> 20:23.908
Plus, we have so much in common.

20:23.909 --> 20:27.070
We're both smart, we're both
ambitious, we're both...

20:28.542 --> 20:32.523
- ...here.
- Rusty, what a pleasant surprise.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.219
Happy Homecoming to you and your friend.

20:35.565 --> 20:38.099
- What are you doing here?
- If you must know,

20:38.100 --> 20:41.150
I have entered into a consensual
sexual relationship with Walter.

20:41.151 --> 20:43.736
And, in fact, we're spending the
entire day in bed ravishing each other

20:43.737 --> 20:46.106
- and I will not be ashamed of it.
- You go, girl.

20:46.107 --> 20:48.277
- Who's Walter?
- Pretty lady!

20:48.698 --> 20:53.402
- Hi. - Should we try pina colada
or black cherry next?

20:55.538 --> 20:56.437
Spitter!

20:57.025 --> 20:59.078
You were drunker than I was last night.

21:00.655 --> 21:02.625
- I'm, uh, thinking cherry.
- OK.

21:12.482 --> 21:13.915
You and, uh, Beaver?

21:14.609 --> 21:15.899
I thought we made out last night.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.320
Actually, it was quite the opposite,

21:17.321 --> 21:18.591
though not for your lack of trying.

21:19.058 --> 21:22.035
I think your exact wording was,
"OK, you can have me now."

21:25.362 --> 21:28.947
OK, I'm sorry, Katherine.
I was really drunk.

21:28.948 --> 21:30.866
I'm just trying to piece
together my evening.

21:30.867 --> 21:34.278
- And, apparently, his dignity.
- Well, if it helps,

21:34.279 --> 21:36.998
I think you left the party
to "Storm the lab."

21:36.999 --> 21:39.342
Storm the lab?
I think you might have misheard me.

21:39.343 --> 21:40.882
You got up on the coffee
table and you said,

21:40.883 --> 21:42.234
"Let's go storm the lab!"

21:43.444 --> 21:45.136
I have someone waiting for me.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.639
I think we found that bad thing.

21:58.839 --> 22:02.134
Dear Lord, please give me the
strength to survive this infestation.

22:02.657 --> 22:04.766
Someone spilled grape juice in the kitchen.

22:04.795 --> 22:07.083
We need you on it pronto, Mr. Belvedere.

22:07.142 --> 22:09.366
Why don't you clean it up
with your mop-like hair?

22:09.367 --> 22:12.565
Dale, need I remind you that
I am one of your employers?

22:12.566 --> 22:14.820
I swear, ever since you
started pledging Omega Chi,

22:14.821 --> 22:16.710
you've developed quite an attitude.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.710
Or maybe you dumped me
because I was a nobody.

22:18.711 --> 22:21.243
And now that I'm a somebody,
it really bothers you.

22:21.244 --> 22:22.577
There are many things that

22:22.578 --> 22:25.318
bother me about you.
That is not one of them.

22:25.319 --> 22:28.697
It must be torture seeing me every day.
The one that got away.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.697
Oh, it's torture all right.

22:35.039 --> 22:36.760
Hey, Dalie! What's the score?

22:37.154 --> 22:38.604
Dale one, Laura zero.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.800
The Farmhands are up, 14-zip.

22:43.186 --> 22:45.407
Damn! I mean, darn it.

22:46.434 --> 22:47.571
Hey, how'd you...?

22:50.992 --> 22:52.380
I wish I'd thought of that.

22:53.013 --> 22:55.978
So I noticed you're friends
with the lady in charge?

22:55.979 --> 22:59.290
That is our current status, I believe.
It's hard to keep track.

22:59.535 --> 23:00.779
They're telling me I can't

23:00.780 --> 23:02.695
climb the rock wall because I'm not 12.

23:02.828 --> 23:04.969
It's flat-out age discrimination.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.644
Maybe you could put in a good word for me?

23:07.645 --> 23:09.717
I don't know. See, we used to date,

23:09.718 --> 23:11.687
and I'm trying to prove to her
that I can be responsible...

23:11.981 --> 23:16.217
Oh, look, I get all my drama
from One Tree Hill, OK?

23:16.552 --> 23:19.737
If you can't help, can you at
least point me to the bathroom?

23:20.554 --> 23:22.737
Yeah, it's upstairs.
I'll get someone to take you.

23:22.738 --> 23:24.727
- I think I can handle it.
- Well,

23:24.728 --> 23:26.662
see, I can't let you go upstairs alone.

23:26.663 --> 23:29.933
- 'Cause that would be irresponsible.
- OK, then you take me.

23:29.934 --> 23:33.845
- That could look bad.
- Dude, I'm not from Perverted Justice.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.844
- You'll wait in the hall.
- Got it.

23:40.025 --> 23:41.890
First down, Titans!

23:44.250 --> 23:47.251
Rebecca, something good happened!
We're bouncing and cheering!

23:48.449 --> 23:52.153
- I don't feel like bouncing.
- Good, 'cause neither do I.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.959
I don't know what bothers me more:

23:55.960 --> 23:58.759
that Evan hasn't texted me
all day, or that I care?

23:59.352 --> 24:00.500
Do you wanna talk about it?

24:01.329 --> 24:03.472
What else is there to say? I'm pathetic.

24:03.621 --> 24:07.179
- No, you're not. - Let's just talk
about you and Casey, OK? Please?

24:07.724 --> 24:10.530
OK. All right.
I don't know what bothers me more:

24:10.531 --> 24:14.136
That I'm so mad at her or that
I can't ask her for advice.

24:14.433 --> 24:15.733
You can ask me instead.

24:17.815 --> 24:21.129
OK. Well, there's this guy... Pedro.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.611
Loving it already. Pedro.

24:23.871 --> 24:25.929
Names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.777
But all you need to know is
that Pedro is wrong for me.

24:28.778 --> 24:31.110
And yet, I'm just so drawn to him.

24:31.586 --> 24:36.149
But if I pursue it, Casey
may never forgive me.

24:37.485 --> 24:40.137
- Then say no to Pedro.
- But I really like Pedro.

24:41.146 --> 24:45.639
- And, in fact, last night we kissed.
- Ash, forget about Pedro.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.377
If he threatens your
relationship with Casey,

24:47.378 --> 24:49.223
he's not worth it. Period.

24:50.443 --> 24:52.710
OK, not what I thought you'd say.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.675
Look, say you go for it with Pedro.

24:55.676 --> 24:57.805
You really decide to let
your guard down with him.

24:58.099 --> 24:59.480
Then, little by little,

24:59.481 --> 25:01.480
you find yourself needing
him more and more.

25:01.481 --> 25:04.158
Then one day you realize
that you love Pedro so much

25:04.159 --> 25:05.813
that the thought of him leaving scares you.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.374
Then he starts pulling away...

25:09.960 --> 25:11.415
Are we still talking about Pedro?

25:11.583 --> 25:13.620
It's a long pass down the field.

25:16.162 --> 25:18.375
Touchdown, Titans!

25:23.926 --> 25:25.449
I can't believe I used my own name.

25:28.559 --> 25:31.499
Well, at least the goat is alive.
So no harm, no foul.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.642
The wire is gone. OK, my wire's gone.

25:36.643 --> 25:39.584
OK, just don't panic.
You'll just, you know, build a new one.

25:39.585 --> 25:41.525
Yeah, sure. I just need $100,000

25:41.526 --> 25:42.834
and the last year of my life back.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.264
Sarcasm doesn't solve any problems,

25:44.265 --> 25:45.116
All my work is gone.

25:45.117 --> 25:46.769
God, man, I'm gonna get expelled

25:46.770 --> 25:49.336
and end up an electrician
like my bitter Uncle Steve.

25:52.629 --> 25:55.288
Rusty, these aren't
letters, they're numbers.

25:55.289 --> 25:57.731
Oh, God, do you think I changed my ATM pin?

25:58.122 --> 26:01.284
No, I think it's a telephone number.
Call it.

26:02.274 --> 26:03.698
Please have my wire.

26:04.365 --> 26:05.912
And be my soul mate.

26:06.251 --> 26:07.845
But just mostly, have the wire.

26:12.096 --> 26:15.216
OK. You scrub that wall, I'm gonna
find out whose phone this is.

26:16.290 --> 26:17.649
Yes, sir, goat man.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.741
Hey, Little Miss Sunshine,
you about done in there?

26:24.354 --> 26:26.960
The name's Hailey. And don't rush me.

26:27.344 --> 26:30.247
I've never seen this
much makeup in my life!

26:30.248 --> 26:33.726
No, no, no, no, no.
Hailey, that's not your stuff.

26:33.727 --> 26:35.927
OK? Just put it down and come on out.

26:36.222 --> 26:38.877
As soon as I finish my smoky eyes.

26:39.211 --> 26:42.266
OK, listen, usually I'm
all about the mischief,

26:42.267 --> 26:45.627
but this is so not cool.
Don't make me bust down this door!

26:45.680 --> 26:46.572
What's going on?

26:47.898 --> 26:49.556
This little girl locked
herself in the bathroom.

26:52.454 --> 26:55.505
Touch my concealer and I swear
to you I will kill Santa Claus!

26:57.112 --> 26:58.216
Jeez.

26:59.296 --> 27:00.661
The shade has been discontinued.

27:02.018 --> 27:03.661
- What are you two doing?
- Not my fault.

27:05.839 --> 27:07.101
It's a funny story.

27:08.165 --> 27:09.516
This little girl needed
to go to the bathroom.

27:09.517 --> 27:11.812
So I escorted her up here,

27:12.021 --> 27:13.917
and then she locked the door.

27:13.918 --> 27:16.869
And might be overdosing on cosmetics.

27:18.347 --> 27:20.162
Well, these things happen.

27:20.163 --> 27:21.224
We'll just call her parents and

27:21.225 --> 27:22.544
see if they have any advice
on how to get her out.

27:22.545 --> 27:24.841
- What's her name?
- Uh, Hailey.

27:25.006 --> 27:26.835
Hailey, Hailey, Hailey...

27:28.426 --> 27:32.070
Hailey. Hailey Segal.
Oh, my God! Hailey Segal?

27:32.071 --> 27:35.247
What? What happened We were being so calm.
It was nice.

27:35.248 --> 27:37.932
You let my torts professor's daughter
lock herself in the bathroom!

27:37.933 --> 27:39.482
Hey, how was I supposed
to know she'd do that?

27:39.483 --> 27:41.295
Oh, I don't know, maybe because
she's an eight year old girl.

27:41.298 --> 27:43.031
- Well...
- Wait. Where'd she go?

27:44.629 --> 27:45.938
Man, she is sneaky.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.274
You were supposed to
keep them under control.

28:00.877 --> 28:02.948
I'm a sorority girl, not SuperNanny.

28:09.027 --> 28:10.951
All right, listen up, you little vermin!

28:11.150 --> 28:12.488
I didn't grow up with your nannies

28:12.489 --> 28:15.206
and your private schools and
your liberal elite ideas.

28:15.207 --> 28:16.572
I grew up on a small farm

28:16.573 --> 28:18.741
in Arkansas where I was
a junior rodeo champ.

28:18.904 --> 28:22.297
So either shut it, or I'll
hog-tie each one of you

28:22.298 --> 28:25.183
in under eight seconds flat.
Now, go get a juice box.

28:25.184 --> 28:26.090
Quietly!

28:32.727 --> 28:34.757
You're totally turned on
right now, aren't you?

28:35.529 --> 28:36.262
I am.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.363
I'm not.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.829
Laura and Dale have corralled

28:43.830 --> 28:45.112
the other kids into one room of the house.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.814
- Any sign of her?
- No, but she couldn't have gotten far.

28:48.004 --> 28:50.072
Unless she's in the back of a van.

28:50.689 --> 28:54.282
Listen. I'm here with you,
we're going to find her, OK?

28:54.644 --> 28:57.766
- OK. - When you guys are done
with your tender moment,

28:57.767 --> 29:00.018
can someone help me down?

29:00.019 --> 29:02.330
Wait, oh! How did you get up there?

29:02.331 --> 29:04.347
Um, where is the safety guy?

29:04.690 --> 29:07.928
Across the street in his
truck listening to the game.

29:09.387 --> 29:10.542
OK. I will go get him.

29:10.543 --> 29:15.012
No, I got it, Case.
OK, Hailey, I want you to let go.

29:15.232 --> 29:18.631
- And I'll catch you.
- Catch me? Are you kidding?

29:18.632 --> 29:20.966
You let me lock myself in the bathroom.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.537
- Get me a grownup.
- OK, fine.

29:25.718 --> 29:28.452
- Have fun falling.
- Where...?

29:30.126 --> 29:31.152
OK, fine.

29:32.128 --> 29:33.147
Here I go.

29:33.703 --> 29:36.547
One, two...

29:38.328 --> 29:39.092
...three!

29:44.221 --> 29:47.576
- See? I got you.
- Oh, my gosh! Are you OK?

29:47.865 --> 29:51.410
I'm fine. How did you get
your eyeliner so thin?

29:54.014 --> 29:55.947
Well, it's good to know that you're OK.

29:58.825 --> 30:01.257
This is the address I found in the phone.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.587
We had to bring the goat?

30:02.870 --> 30:04.321
I couldn't just leave her in the lab.

30:04.670 --> 30:05.535
How do you know it's a her?

30:09.981 --> 30:11.067
Rusty!

30:11.267 --> 30:13.231
And a goat.

30:14.741 --> 30:17.653
- Please tell me you have my phone.
- Uh, yep, here you go.

30:18.252 --> 30:19.267
Did I leave it in the lab?

30:19.268 --> 30:21.048
We ran out of there so fast last night.

30:21.435 --> 30:24.440
I know, that was crazy. We were running...

30:27.504 --> 30:29.918
You don't remember me, do you?

30:30.195 --> 30:32.565
- Nope, sorry, I don't.
- I'm Calvin.

30:32.566 --> 30:35.095
Ah! Rusty's gay friend. I'm Denise.

30:35.693 --> 30:36.708
You really don't remember me?

30:37.623 --> 30:40.852
- I pierced your nipple.
- Why would you do that?

30:41.301 --> 30:42.481
Well, you asked me to.

30:42.482 --> 30:44.209
You said that wire we
stole was a part of you,

30:44.210 --> 30:46.570
and you wanted it implanted
closest to your heart.

30:46.571 --> 30:50.313
- You pierced my nipple with my wire?
- OK, weird.

30:50.314 --> 30:53.240
We need to find said wire so
Rusty here doesn't get expelled.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.791
I tossed it in a dumpster somewhere
along Greek Row last night.

30:57.629 --> 30:59.474
Well, why didn't you just
leave it in my nipple?

30:59.895 --> 31:00.897
We saw that campus cop

31:00.898 --> 31:02.288
and you told me to get rid of the evidence.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.221
Denise, it's been a pleasure.
Rusty, let's go.

31:06.039 --> 31:08.822
Hey, did, uh, we make out, by any chance?

31:09.277 --> 31:13.285
God, no. You look too much
like one of my ex-girlfriends.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.517
Titans have beaten the Farmhands 17-14.

31:23.975 --> 31:25.502
CRU thanks you...

31:28.150 --> 31:31.484
Hi, there. You, uh... You hiding from me?

31:32.696 --> 31:35.296
No. No, I was just...
I was just admiring this girl's hair.

31:35.528 --> 31:38.889
- It's so soft.
- OK. It's because I have a kid.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.457
That totally freaked you out, didn't it?

31:41.919 --> 31:44.710
And you're also Casey's professor.
And you're way older than me.

31:44.975 --> 31:47.320
So the daughter was just the
icing on the crazy cake.

31:47.321 --> 31:49.128
OK, first of all, I'm
not way older than you.

31:49.635 --> 31:52.489
You make me sound like I'm Larry King.

31:53.794 --> 31:55.439
Second, you're not my student.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.109
Third, Casey is an adult.

31:57.110 --> 32:00.488
I think she could handle...
you and me dating.

32:01.791 --> 32:05.022
Wait. Who said anything about dating?
We barely know each other.

32:05.023 --> 32:08.882
That's exactly why I want to take you
to dinner. To get to know you.

32:14.167 --> 32:17.004
- Simon.
- Well, think about it.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.896
At the very least, it's a free meal.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.101
Ok.

32:24.187 --> 32:25.314
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:31.089 --> 32:32.905
Let's just tie the goat
to the back of the bus,

32:32.906 --> 32:33.825
then we'll hit the Dumpsters.

32:34.588 --> 32:35.186
Can't wait.

32:36.511 --> 32:38.271
Come on. Thattagirl.

32:43.921 --> 32:47.493
I forgot how to tie a sheepshank?
Some Eagle Scout.

32:49.512 --> 32:51.318
Rusty, we gotta get out
of here, like right now.

32:52.081 --> 32:53.502
Cartwright, is this your new girlfriend?

32:54.473 --> 32:55.555
Shut up, Trip.

32:57.603 --> 32:59.157
Uh, that's a freaky three-way.

33:03.069 --> 33:06.817
- Damn it. I did not need that.
- Don't worry about it.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.609
- They'll get over it.
- No, they won't.

33:08.610 --> 33:11.428
- They're your brothers.
- And they're having serious issues

33:11.429 --> 33:13.388
- with my loyalty.
- You're the most loyal guy I know.

33:13.389 --> 33:14.282
If they can't handle that,

33:14.283 --> 33:17.226
- that's their problem.
- No, it's my problem.

33:17.506 --> 33:18.667
Because while you've been out stealing

33:18.668 --> 33:21.063
goats and becoming a hero,
I've become a villain.

33:21.064 --> 33:22.298
And I don't know how to change it.

33:23.967 --> 33:26.703
- Goatboy! Can we get a pic?
- Yeah, sure.

33:28.525 --> 33:31.332
I'll catch you later, Rusty.
Good luck finding that girl.

33:44.253 --> 33:45.366
Here you go.

33:46.101 --> 33:47.673
- Thanks.
- Bye.

33:50.335 --> 33:53.160
- Thank God I'm not pregnant.
- I couldn't agree more.

33:53.161 --> 33:56.169
Being a parent sucks.
Let's go back to being kids again.

33:58.688 --> 34:01.496
- See ya, Cap.
- Did I say something wrong?

34:02.466 --> 34:05.399
- I'm just tired.
- Hey, talk to me.

34:11.033 --> 34:13.356
You always get to be the kid.

34:13.853 --> 34:16.339
And that means I always
have to be the adult.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.772
Well, you were pretty kid-like last night.

34:18.773 --> 34:20.149
And we had unprotected sex.

34:22.065 --> 34:25.670
- Listen to me. I sound like a mom.
- No, you sound responsible.

34:26.050 --> 34:28.606
- You push me, and I like it.
- But I don't.

34:29.378 --> 34:31.996
And this is why it won't work between us.

34:31.996 --> 34:35.127
Because one day you'll start
resenting me for pushing.

34:35.362 --> 34:38.380
And then I'll start to resent
you for having to push.

34:38.382 --> 34:41.563
And our whole relationship
will implode, and I just...

34:43.630 --> 34:45.851
I love you too much to let that happen.

35:13.637 --> 35:14.611
Damn it.

35:18.637 --> 35:21.706
- Why are you in our dumpster?
- I don't...

35:22.293 --> 35:24.939
Well, I'm looking for my wire.

35:25.314 --> 35:27.729
- I'm so confused.
- Me, too.

35:28.535 --> 35:31.111
I'm never drinking that much again.
I screwed up big time.

35:31.112 --> 35:34.240
Join the club.
Cappie and I got drunk and...

35:34.929 --> 35:35.493
...studied.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.787
Boy, he's really taking the
major thing seriously, huh?

35:39.359 --> 35:42.679
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

35:42.680 --> 35:45.701
Studying is our euphemism
for sex, remember?

35:46.782 --> 35:48.888
Well, he declared a major: philosophy.

35:48.889 --> 35:50.771
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.

35:51.176 --> 35:53.503
He talked to this rich alum
yesterday about a job.

35:53.793 --> 35:56.713
- He's even taking a 10am class.
- Tuesday/Thursday?

35:56.714 --> 35:59.080
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday.
- Oh, my God!

35:59.081 --> 36:02.006
Calvin said Cappie hasn't
even fallen asleep once.

36:02.593 --> 36:03.688
Well, that was two weeks ago

36:04.338 --> 36:05.919
when I was dealing with the Dana situation.

36:06.886 --> 36:09.415
I said I'd call him back, and I never did.

36:11.263 --> 36:13.192
You kind of went on a little detour there.
But you were saying

36:13.193 --> 36:15.010
about Cappie and major...

36:18.403 --> 36:19.433
My wire!

36:22.682 --> 36:24.453
Well... All right, I gotta go

36:24.454 --> 36:26.476
clean the blood off this
and return it to the lab.

36:26.477 --> 36:27.580
I've gotta run, Case.

36:33.769 --> 36:35.510
Rebecca, listen, before you go in there...

36:35.511 --> 36:36.885
Casey, spare me the lecture.

36:36.886 --> 36:38.736
Chaperoning our events is part of your job.

36:38.944 --> 36:40.659
Plus, I figured it's good practice for you

36:40.660 --> 36:42.354
since we all know you'll end
up being a stay-at-home mom.

36:42.355 --> 36:44.234
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.691
OK, good night.

36:51.074 --> 36:52.339
Casey!

37:05.759 --> 37:06.657
Calvin!

37:14.801 --> 37:17.882
- What are you doing here?
- I came to apologize,

37:18.410 --> 37:20.507
but I didn't want to make things
worse by ringing the doorbell.

37:20.997 --> 37:24.146
- Look, Rusty, don't worry about it.
- I want to worry about it.

37:25.195 --> 37:26.056
I haven't been...

37:26.911 --> 37:29.286
I haven't been the best
friend to you recently.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.025
And you said your brothers
question your loyalty,

37:32.026 --> 37:33.362
and I don't want you to question mine.

37:33.811 --> 37:35.007
You've been wrapped up in your own stuff.

37:35.437 --> 37:38.045
- It happens.
- Not to us.

37:40.563 --> 37:43.590
- What's been going on?
- There's nothing you can do.

37:47.038 --> 37:48.054
I can listen.

37:52.267 --> 37:53.968
Cappie, if you're planning on

37:53.969 --> 37:56.433
jumping out and scaring me,
I'm really not in the mood.

37:59.187 --> 38:01.096
Welcome to Cappieland!

38:01.097 --> 38:03.104
Where even the most
frazzled of house mothers

38:03.261 --> 38:06.104
can be a kid for a night. What'll it be?

38:06.533 --> 38:08.271
You wanna test your limits
on the Puke-a-tron?

38:08.775 --> 38:11.909
Or fly to the moon on the Astrorider?

38:14.178 --> 38:16.291
Cap, before all that, Rusty told me...

38:18.129 --> 38:19.922
Not another word, young lady,

38:19.923 --> 38:21.586
or you won't get a piece of pie later.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.838
Now, pick your ride.

38:29.036 --> 38:30.459
I pick the Astrorider.

38:32.748 --> 38:35.743
- 'Cause it sounds naughty.
- Good choice. Come on.

38:37.573 --> 38:40.864
Take a seat. Coming around back.

38:40.866 --> 38:41.932
Here we go.

38:43.839 --> 38:47.347
Ok, let's get some height here.

38:49.131 --> 38:51.007
Oh, yeah, I think this is high enough.

38:51.008 --> 38:52.951
The truth is, I did resent you, Case.

38:53.653 --> 38:55.706
You kept pushing me to
think about the future,

38:55.707 --> 38:57.839
when I just wanted to live in the present.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.136
But then you pushed me so
high, I finally saw it.

39:02.233 --> 39:04.848
- Saw what?
- What my future could look like.

39:05.753 --> 39:08.562
A job I actually like, friends that I love

39:09.445 --> 39:10.847
and the girl of my dreams on my arm.

39:11.467 --> 39:14.413
Cap, this moment could be so much
better if I was on the ground.

39:14.414 --> 39:19.053
Not yet. Right now, just
let go and enjoy this.

39:19.142 --> 39:20.004
I got you.

39:29.374 --> 39:31.368
- My shoe!
- Oh, I got it.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.390
- No, it's OK, I got it.
- It's fine, it's right here.

39:33.391 --> 39:36.095
Oh, God, Cappie! Oh, my God!

39:37.305 --> 39:37.878
Cappie!

39:38.570 --> 39:40.734
Are you OK? Are you all right?

39:42.535 --> 39:43.663
Gosh.

39:44.488 --> 39:45.517
Sorry.

40:05.018 --> 40:06.707
- Hey, what's up, Ash?
- Hey.

40:07.982 --> 40:09.363
You look like you're feeling better.

40:09.364 --> 40:10.937
I pieced together most of my evening.

40:12.271 --> 40:13.377
- You did?
- Except I know

40:13.378 --> 40:15.393
something good happened to me last night.

40:18.754 --> 40:22.553
- Maybe some mysteries are never
meant to be solved. - Maybe.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.742
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

40:27.132 --> 40:30.656
I'm heading out on the town.
Lots of victory parties tonight.

40:31.455 --> 40:34.021
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.

40:52.354 --> 40:55.758
Ash, is that you? I'm really drunk.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.680
I didn't know where else to go.

41:00.996 --> 41:03.430
- Casey and I got in a fight.
- Did you eat in her car?

41:03.431 --> 41:04.492
'Cause I've been there.

41:06.847 --> 41:08.338
I don't know what's wrong with me.

41:09.044 --> 41:10.753
Hey, you were just hungry.

41:12.086 --> 41:13.199
That's all.

41:14.884 --> 41:16.364
I can't get a job.

41:17.554 --> 41:20.194
I have $84 in my bank account.

41:21.504 --> 41:24.695
And then I get in a huge
fight with my best friend.

41:27.661 --> 41:29.003
But on the plus side,

41:30.336 --> 41:35.064
a man who's old enough to be
president bought me a drink.

41:35.065 --> 41:37.849
That's funny 'cause you
were president once of ZBZ.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.187
The sad thing is I actually

41:42.188 --> 41:45.021
thought maybe this hot old
guy could take care of me.

41:46.565 --> 41:47.991
What is wrong with me?

41:47.992 --> 41:49.333
Nothing is wrong with you at all.

41:49.334 --> 41:51.907
In fact, you are gonna do
amazing things with your life.

41:54.887 --> 41:55.876
How do you know that?

41:57.816 --> 42:01.725
Because... you are a human magnet.

42:02.814 --> 42:03.996
And people are drawn to you.

42:05.346 --> 42:06.395
They are?

42:09.372 --> 42:10.280
Yes.

42:18.938 --> 42:19.778
Nipple!

42:22.100 --> 42:23.445
Um, Rusty, it's late.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.485
Ok.

42:25.380 --> 42:28.603
I... And I'm really drunk.
I don't know if you know that.

42:29.251 --> 42:30.293
And I need some air.

42:34.981 --> 42:35.914
Rusty, wait!

42:38.153 --> 42:40.327
You have some lipstick on your...

42:44.590 --> 42:45.386
You got it.

43:16.287 --> 43:17.412
Wow. You,

43:19.366 --> 43:22.370
- You look amazing.
- Oh. Thanks.

43:23.245 --> 43:25.227
- Shall we?
- We shall.
