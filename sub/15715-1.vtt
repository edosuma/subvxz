19:57.613 --> 20:02.200
Our own expendability, that's all you
can ever really count on in this life.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.660
Yeah, tell me about it.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.331
Doesn't really explain the eye, though.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.212
It's a bit complicated,

20:14.713 --> 20:16.088
to say the least.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.550
I guess some investments can really cost you.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.846
Yeah.

20:26.099 --> 20:30.561
Can you keep them coming, please? Thanks.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.690
I've known her for years.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.317
Since college.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.821
I've known Mike... I met him just before.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.073
And Mike is?

20:43.909 --> 20:45.451
He was my best friend.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.161
Your best friend that's fucking your wife?

20:48.038 --> 20:51.415
Yeah, well, he's not my... Yeah, yeah.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.417
Well, it's okay, then.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.837
Yeah, son of a bitch was my best man at our wedding.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.173
(SIGHING)

20:59.258 --> 21:02.426
You know, Allan, what you said before, you were right.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.679
You are a human punching bag.

21:05.722 --> 21:09.767
You allow your boss to pass you
over like a Jewish holiday.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.812
You obviously allowed someone to
work one over on you pretty good.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.398
And you allowed your wife to fuck another guy.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.607
I wouldn't say I allowed it.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.902
Yes, you did, Allan. You allowed it. All of it.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.697
You're the one who said it.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.407
You're so afraid to stand up for yourself

21:24.491 --> 21:26.951
no matter what anyone does to you.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.079
That makes you a self-perpetuating
victim of circumstance.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.205
I'm not looking for any sympathy here.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.415
I just wanted to have some...

21:32.499 --> 21:36.919
Shoulder. I get it. Your problem,
Allan, is that you're weak.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.589
Your wife sees it. That's why she figures

21:40.674 --> 21:42.049
she can sleep with your best friend.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.843
Your best friend, he sees it.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.219
That's why he figures he can wrap legs with her

21:45.304 --> 21:46.595
and not suffer any real consequences.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.725
I think you're... You're crossing the line a little bit.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.059
Okay.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.186
Who the hell are you

21:54.271 --> 21:57.315
to tell me who I am and who I'm not?

21:58.775 --> 22:01.152
As far as I see it, I'm the closest thing

22:01.236 --> 22:02.903
to a friend you've ever really had.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.992
I mean, we've known each other
for what, two hours? Come on...

22:08.076 --> 22:11.287
How long did you know Mike?
Look how that turned out.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.166
I'm your friend, Allan,

22:15.250 --> 22:17.626
because I got the balls to be brutally honest with you.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.130
Complete and total openness,

22:21.214 --> 22:22.673
no skipping paragraphs.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.676
Everybody else in your life is full of shit.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.932
You know, for somebody who claims
to know so little about people,

22:32.017 --> 22:34.518
you certainly got everything figured out.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.147
Hmm?

22:39.274 --> 22:41.108
It's part of my job.

22:43.862 --> 22:47.156
What's that? You're like a...

22:47.366 --> 22:50.451
(CHUCKLING) You a shrink? You shrink
heads for a living? What do you do?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.204
I'm a professional killer, Allan.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.670
Bullshit.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.005
Jim O'Bannon,

23:03.090 --> 23:04.840
that guy we saw on the TV earlier?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.384
Hmm. What about him?

23:16.311 --> 23:17.395
Yeah, right.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.609
When I said I wasn't much of a people person,

23:25.278 --> 23:26.779
I meant I always work alone.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.116
But I always know my opponent.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.118
That's how I can read people so well.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.787
Seriously?

23:35.872 --> 23:37.415
If it was a joke, would it be funny?

23:38.875 --> 23:39.959
Seriously?

23:44.798 --> 23:49.176
Okay, fine. Let's say hypothetically,

23:50.303 --> 23:54.473
you killed O'Bannon. Why?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.644
I was paid to perform a job, but then decided

23:58.728 --> 24:01.480
to come here and do O'Bannon instead.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.315
Personal reasons.

24:04.192 --> 24:07.403
That's pretty sloppy for a so-called professional.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.029
I mean, you come here, you kill O'Bannon,

24:09.114 --> 24:14.201
and then you give a tell-all to a complete stranger.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.663
But we're not complete strangers,
Allan. We're friends, remember?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.623
Here we go.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.125
(LAUGHING)

24:22.586 --> 24:24.462
Here, I'll prove it.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.926
Write down five names.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.219
What?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.513
Pretend you just paid me a considerable
amount of money.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.682
(CLEARING THROAT) I work for you now.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.226
You want five people dead, and you're gonna

24:39.311 --> 24:40.603
write their names on that napkin.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.022
Okay, come on. Come on.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.274
Everybody has names, Allan.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.692
Especially you.

24:51.865 --> 24:55.367
Okay. I'll play along.

24:56.536 --> 25:00.998
So what, like, what specific order do you want?

25:01.082 --> 25:02.208
What do you want?

25:03.460 --> 25:07.254
Let's say number five dies first
and then I work my way up.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.590
Number one being the priority.

25:11.009 --> 25:16.597
Five, okay, so I'll put, five. Okay,
how about... Okay, five.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.643
Fred Gates. You know, the boss
that I was telling you about.

25:21.102 --> 25:24.438
Okay. Thanks.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.857
Okay, Fred Gates.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.195
Number four. Brian Felzner.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.696
The guy that got your promotion.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.198
He stole my idea.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.826
He did. He stole my idea. He put
his little spin on it, whatever.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.745
But he stole my idea, Jonas.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.830
And this is the kind of douchebag, let me tell you.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.290
I hate people like this.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.334
They drive around in their little
cars, and they have these...

25:45.418 --> 25:47.044
You know, the personalized license plates.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.129
His says "Feltz" on it.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.800
I mean, he should die just for that reason.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.886
Okay, so Brian Felzner. That's number four.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.306
Like I said, Allan, I can read you like an open book.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.808
Number three.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.602
You're gonna like this one.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.231
Dom Escatdo.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.275
Is that a cartoon character?

26:10.318 --> 26:13.737
That's the one who, you know,
gave me the bump here.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.155
The investment. Yeah.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.408
Then his number's definitely up.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.285
Number two.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.786
(SIGHING)

26:22.914 --> 26:24.415
It's a tough one. Mike Dodd.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.126
Again, not without just cause.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.295
And number one...

26:35.635 --> 26:36.844
My sweet little wife.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.096
Well, then that bitch definitely got to go.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.479
Okay, okay. There you go.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.274
There you go.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.321
Now you can psychoanalyze me all you want.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.826
It's a good list, Allan. No Dr. Phils.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.956
I'm gonna take a leak. This is...

27:06.041 --> 27:07.625
This is therapeutic. This feels good.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.878
It's too bad you're not the real thing, Jonas.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.576
(DOOR OPENING)

27:48.041 --> 27:49.166
(CLOCK TICKING)

28:21.574 --> 28:22.866
(FRIDGE DOOR OPENING)

28:31.501 --> 28:32.626
What the hell!

28:34.838 --> 28:36.004
(GATES GRUNTING)

28:46.641 --> 28:48.767
As far as I see it, I'm the closest thing

28:48.852 --> 28:50.227
to a best friend you've ever had.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.479
SYDNEY: I just wanted you to
know we slept together, Allan.

28:52.647 --> 28:53.647
We slept together, Allan.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.776
You allowed your wife to fuck another guy.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.944
Hey, Allan.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.863
You care? You really don't care, do you?

29:00.989 --> 29:02.531
Felzner is the future.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.824
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.492
It's as simple as that.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.828
Your problem, Allan, is that you're weak.

29:07.954 --> 29:08.954
Hey.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.205
Yeah, trying to get ahead.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.498
Is that the new power color?

29:11.624 --> 29:12.708
Trying to get ahead.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.168
Strong choice, man.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.503
Trying to get ahead, you fell behind.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.172
You are a human punching bag.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.257
Look at your fucking face. Look at your fucking face.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.342
You think I actually believe that's an accident.

29:22.635 --> 29:23.677
JONAS: I work for you now.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.220
You want five people dead,

29:25.346 --> 29:26.638
and you're gonna write their names on that napkin.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.349
Fucking your wife. Fucking your
wife. Fucking your wife.

29:30.685 --> 29:31.810
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

29:42.822 --> 29:45.991
Oh, God. Hello?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.242
SYDNEY: Where are you?

29:48.203 --> 29:49.661
Why haven't you called me back?

29:50.538 --> 29:51.705
(SIGHING)

29:51.998 --> 29:53.415
Maybe 'cause I knew it was you, Syd.

29:53.541 --> 29:54.875
I've been calling you all night, Allan.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.754
I thought maybe with the way your face looked...

29:59.088 --> 30:01.548
Why do you care? Why do you care where I've been?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.676
I care, and you know that.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.970
I just needed...

30:07.055 --> 30:08.180
Shit.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.242
McKay!

30:29.285 --> 30:31.036
Come on, boss. I just got here.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.913
We just got another shooting.

30:33.039 --> 30:34.706
Where? Out by Frankfurt.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.917
Weird thing is it looks like it ties into O'Bannon.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.502
Oh, yeah? How so?

30:38.586 --> 30:40.504
Ballistics matched the slugs we took out of O'Bannon

30:40.588 --> 30:42.256
and his bodyguards.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.759
They've ID'd them as something
called a 5.7 millimeter.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.469
Really?

30:47.929 --> 30:49.304
You know something?

30:49.430 --> 30:51.098
The 5.7's only been on the market a few years.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.683
It's nasty shit.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.726
Super accurate, screaming hot velocity,

30:54.811 --> 30:56.520
kind of stuff you find on the battlefield,

30:56.604 --> 30:58.522
not in your backyard. That's just great.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.190
So tell me more about this new one.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.359
Like I said, same MO as before.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.862
Only this time it looks like he took his time with it.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.573
Crime scene figures after the first shot to the belly,

31:07.657 --> 31:09.283
he let him flail around for an hour or so

31:09.409 --> 31:11.410
before finishing him off with two more to the head.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.621
Okay, so this one's a little more
personal. Who's the vic?

31:28.803 --> 31:29.970
Hey, man.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.556
What the hell is going on?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.016
You didn't hear?

31:34.642 --> 31:35.809
No, Drew. What's going on?

31:36.519 --> 31:38.812
Gates, man. He's dead.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.481
What?

31:42.358 --> 31:43.525
He's dead.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.945
The cops are supposed to be by this morning
and ask us all some questions.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.283
Number five. My boss, Fred Gates.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.537
Have you seen Felzner around?

31:55.663 --> 31:57.998
Number four. Brian Felzner.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.375
DREW: Brian? I don't know.

32:00.501 --> 32:03.003
I think he had a meeting over at Victor Rosen's. Why?

32:03.838 --> 32:05.839
No, I was just... I was just curious.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.634
You okay, man?

32:08.718 --> 32:09.843
Hmm?

32:10.386 --> 32:11.511
You don't look so good.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.264
No, yeah, no... I'm fine. Will you
put that at my desk, please?

32:14.349 --> 32:16.224
I just... I drank a lot last night, Drew.

32:24.692 --> 32:25.817
Hey, do you work here?

32:27.028 --> 32:28.570
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

32:28.696 --> 32:29.780
Detective McKay. Hi.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.031
What's your name? Allan Campbell.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.116
Hey, Allan. Look, I don't know if you're aware,

32:33.201 --> 32:35.202
but your boss was murdered last night.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.620
No, yeah, no, I heard. That's...

32:36.704 --> 32:39.164
Yeah, someone broke into his house and shot him.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.041
What are you guys thinking, a robbery or...

32:41.542 --> 32:42.584
Well, you can only be robbed

32:42.710 --> 32:44.378
if something gets taken, right? Hmm.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.296
Look, I'm here to talk to all the employees,

32:46.381 --> 32:47.547
but now that we've already met,

32:47.674 --> 32:48.674
why don't I start with you?

32:48.758 --> 32:49.883
You know, Detective, if you don't mind,

32:50.009 --> 32:51.051
I have a really important meeting

32:51.177 --> 32:52.177
that I'm already late for.

32:52.261 --> 32:53.345
So if I could come back anytime,

32:53.429 --> 32:54.930
I can come back today or...

32:55.723 --> 32:57.015
Yeah, yeah, sure.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.600
How about noon?

Yeah. Noon's fine.

I hope you don't mind me asking,

Oh, at home with my wife. Yeah.

What the hell are you doing here?

34:02.457 --> 34:03.957
Waiting for you, obviously.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.257
You killed Gates?

34:14.302 --> 34:15.427
You're welcome.

34:19.806 --> 34:20.974
Why are you doing this?

34:21.809 --> 34:23.893
I'm your friend, remember?

34:23.978 --> 34:27.105
Jonas, this is fucking crazy. Stop it, please.

34:27.982 --> 34:33.987
Some people never go crazy. What
truly horrible lives they must lead.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.156
I don't want you to do this. Please.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.867
How are you planning on stopping me, Allan?

34:38.993 --> 34:40.827
By going to the police?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.746
Be sure to mention your involvement

34:42.830 --> 34:44.331

34:44.540 --> 34:46.500
What! Are you... What!

34:46.626 --> 34:48.918
I'm sure there's no legal ramifications

34:49.003 --> 34:50.378
for something like that.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.799
Listen, God damn it! I was just having a drink,

34:53.882 --> 34:55.926
having a conversation, just friendly conversation!

34:56.010 --> 34:58.220
I don't... This is a joke! I thought it was a joke!

34:58.513 --> 35:00.680

I don't want people to die!

35:06.854 --> 35:09.272
Okay. Look, fine.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.859
Fine, if I'm your employer,

35:14.362 --> 35:15.904
then you're fired. Okay?

35:16.364 --> 35:17.405
You're fired. That's it.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.573
Let's just end this.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.367
No can do, Allan.

I'm not the kind of guy to turn his back on a friend

Sick? What the...

35:28.209 --> 35:29.709
What are you talking about?

35:30.128 --> 35:33.421
You allow the people in your life to walk all over you.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.589
That's a sickness.

35:35.716 --> 35:37.592
No. They have to learn

that there are consequences when they fail you.

You know, it's funny, your buddy Drew, here,

37:03.804 --> 37:05.305
and I were actually just talking about you.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.556
What?

37:06.641 --> 37:09.809
Yeah, you and your boss had some kind
of disagreement yesterday, Allan?

37:09.894 --> 37:11.228
No, no, no, no. Just listen to me.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.730
I didn't kill him, okay, but I know who did.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.273
Oh, yeah? And who might that be?

37:15.358 --> 37:16.608
Look, there was a guy I was drinking with

37:16.692 --> 37:17.776
in a bar last night.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.985
His name is Jonas.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.323
he was the one who clipped Gates?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.533
Yeah! And he's going after Felzner next!

Who's Felzner? Brian Felzner!

37:36.170 --> 37:37.337

He flattens Felzner in the Caddy, and then he hops out

and he double taps him for good measure.

He's a pro.

Why run him over and make a show of it?

48:46.506 --> 48:49.216
that your husband was with you the whole night?

48:52.012 --> 48:53.095
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

48:53.513 --> 48:54.680
Yes.

48:55.557 --> 48:56.849
He was.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.602
What are your husband's thoughts
on Jim O'Bannon, Mrs. Campbell?

49:00.187 --> 49:01.395
What?

49:02.022 --> 49:03.189
I'm sorry,

49:03.273 --> 49:05.358
are you suggesting Allan had
something to do with that?

49:05.609 --> 49:07.944
Yeah, that's what we're trying to figure out.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.613
You ever seen this man before, Mrs. Campbell?

49:13.617 --> 49:16.077
Just from this photo from the
news. But besides that, no.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.244
You've never seen him before?

49:17.371 --> 49:19.080
You have absolutely no idea who he is?

49:19.206 --> 49:20.748
No. I don't. Then why in the hell

49:20.874 --> 49:21.958
was your husband in the car with him

49:22.042 --> 49:23.125
when he killed one of my men?

49:23.210 --> 49:25.461
I don't know! Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on!

49:25.545 --> 49:26.921
But trust me, Allan would never

49:27.047 --> 49:28.381
have gotten involved with something like this.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.049
He couldn't have.

49:30.133 --> 49:32.259
And yet, strangely enough, he does have motive

49:32.427 --> 49:33.970
for at least two of these victims.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.639
Okay. What about any disputes he may have had?

49:37.057 --> 49:39.976
Aside from the one with his boss and Brian Felzner.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.560
Any enemies, maybe?

49:42.604 --> 49:44.355
No, just because he didn't get a promotion at work

49:44.439 --> 49:46.565
does not make these people his enemies, Detective.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.733
Not necessarily, no.

49:47.901 --> 49:51.320
But it doesn't make them his
friends now, either, does it?

49:51.446 --> 49:52.989
What about his eye? How'd that happen?

49:55.325 --> 49:56.450
I don't know.

49:57.411 --> 49:58.744
You don't know?

49:59.788 --> 50:00.913
(LAUGHING)

50:02.833 --> 50:04.917
I'm sorry, Mrs. Campbell, but he's your husband.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.169
I mean, I'm not a married guy,

50:07.254 --> 50:08.921
so maybe I'm speaking out of turn here.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.631
But I'd like to think that if I was

50:10.757 --> 50:12.675
and I came home looking like
I'd been decked in the face

50:12.759 --> 50:14.969
that maybe my wife would at least inquire

50:15.095 --> 50:16.345
as to how the hell it happened.

50:16.763 --> 50:19.306
Look, he just said it was an accident.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.142
And I trust him. HARP: And that's it?

50:21.268 --> 50:22.351
Yes.

50:22.811 --> 50:25.271
You just left it at that? No further questions?

50:25.689 --> 50:26.814
Yes.

50:26.940 --> 50:29.900
You and your husband having any
problems lately, Mrs. Campbell?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.277
Trouble at home? I'm sorry.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.029
What... What does that have to do with anything?

50:33.488 --> 50:35.614
Hmm. It's just a question.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.950
Everybody has problems.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.121
(SIGHING) Yeah.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.026
JONAS: Here we are, Allan.

51:16.823 --> 51:18.157
Jonas,

51:19.201 --> 51:20.326
this is the one guy

51:20.410 --> 51:21.702
on the list I don't care about.

51:23.663 --> 51:25.915
I mean, look what he did to my eye.

51:29.669 --> 51:30.669
(GU N COCKING)

51:59.199 --> 52:02.368
What's the story with you and that cartoon, anyway?

52:05.413 --> 52:08.207
You don't seem like the degenerate type.

52:08.917 --> 52:13.254
A friend of mine at work told me about
a fix. Said it was a sure thing.

52:13.421 --> 52:16.382
Aside from death, there is no sure thing, my friend.

52:17.217 --> 52:19.218
I promise you that shit.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.320
We ain't open yet.

52:40.574 --> 52:41.907
MAN: Let's get out of here.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.076
I was wondering if I could talk to Dom.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.203
And what the fuck do you want to see him for?

52:46.288 --> 52:48.747
Tell him it's Allan Campbell regarding
the money he owes him.

53:04.598 --> 53:07.933
DOM: I'm telling you, all right.
You gotta come down here.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.603
No, we got the place gutted. It still needs a lot of work.

53:10.687 --> 53:15.357
But your money's being well spent. Trust me.

53:15.483 --> 53:16.567
When we're through with this place,

53:16.651 --> 53:19.486
it's gonna be the hottest fucking
nightclub in town. All right?

53:19.613 --> 53:20.654
Yes.

53:22.949 --> 53:25.201
I think these guys want to see
you about a little bit of money.

53:28.496 --> 53:30.372
I gotta call you back.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.002
I remember you.

53:35.503 --> 53:37.004
Your eye looks good.

53:38.131 --> 53:39.590
You got my money already?

53:39.674 --> 53:41.508
No. I... No.

53:42.135 --> 53:43.219
Hmm.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.137
Then what the fuck are you doing here?

53:46.139 --> 53:49.975
What did I say to you the first and
last time we spoke? Hmm?

53:51.144 --> 53:54.396
You have two weeks and the next time I see you

53:54.481 --> 53:56.649
you better have my fucking money.

53:56.733 --> 54:02.404
Mr. Escatdo, I'm afraid Allan has
given you all that he has to give.

54:03.990 --> 54:05.741
What are you, his lawyer?

54:05.825 --> 54:08.035
Who the hell are you? What the
fuck are you even doing here?

54:08.161 --> 54:09.203
I'm his friend.

54:09.329 --> 54:13.499
His friend? Is this some kind of fucking joke?

54:13.667 --> 54:15.876
If it was, would it be funny?

54:21.841 --> 54:23.342
So let me get this straight.

54:24.010 --> 54:26.303
You bring this Shaft wannabe in here

54:26.388 --> 54:30.516
to intimidate me out of the money you owe me?

54:31.017 --> 54:33.102
Does that sound about right? Some shit like that?

54:33.186 --> 54:34.353
Yeah.

54:34.562 --> 54:37.064
Do you even know who the fuck I am?

54:37.190 --> 54:41.193
JONAS: Mr. Escatdo, Allan is not a gambling man.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.029
He had a lapse in judgment.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.906
Made a mistake.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.074
And I'm pretty sure

54:47.200 --> 54:50.369
he had every intention of paying you
back once he got his promotion.

54:51.538 --> 54:54.206
Oh. So what, I'm supposed to
just cut my losses? Is that it?

54:54.708 --> 54:56.292
That would be greatly appreciated.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.377
Listen, you little piece of shit.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.922
I'm not afraid of this sly motherfucker here!

55:02.048 --> 55:05.759
But if you do not get me my money,
I will fucking smoke you

55:06.261 --> 55:08.053
and everyone who's ever fucking known you!

55:08.430 --> 55:10.806
And when I say everyone, I mean every fucking body!

55:11.391 --> 55:12.433
You...

55:16.771 --> 55:18.063
DOM: Fuck you!

55:19.149 --> 55:20.232
(GROANING)

55:23.069 --> 55:24.111
Fuck.

55:27.741 --> 55:29.408
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

55:29.492 --> 55:31.076
Come. No, no, no.

55:32.829 --> 55:34.079
Jesus Christ.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.415
(GRUNTING)

55:38.585 --> 55:39.668
Shoot him. What?

55:40.503 --> 55:41.628
Shoot him, Allan.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.297
What are you doing? Hey, come on.

55:44.257 --> 55:46.133
Shoot him, Allan. No, no, no.

55:46.259 --> 55:49.094
You don't owe me anything. All
right? The debt's cleared.

55:49.179 --> 55:50.262
You said it.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.972
You don't care what happens to him, right?

55:52.932 --> 55:54.600
Isn't that what you said to me?

55:56.978 --> 55:58.270
You think I'm fucking stupid?

55:58.355 --> 55:59.438
ALLAN: No.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.648
No. What was your plan?

56:01.775 --> 56:03.692
I don't have... You put Dom and I in a room together

56:03.777 --> 56:05.235
and then we just wipe each other out?

56:05.320 --> 56:06.362
Was that it? Seriously?

56:06.446 --> 56:07.613
ALLAN: I'm sorry.

56:07.655 --> 56:08.864
No. Hey. Please don't make me a part of this.

56:08.948 --> 56:10.074
I don't want to be a part...

56:10.158 --> 56:11.533
You are a part of it, Allan.

56:11.618 --> 56:13.786
Whether you like it or not, you're a part of this.

56:14.287 --> 56:15.329
God.

56:15.455 --> 56:16.872
The part you play is up to you.

56:17.624 --> 56:18.707
Shoot him.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.000
DOM: Don't! Don't listen to him!

56:20.126 --> 56:22.044
I will fucking pay you! I will pay you!

56:22.128 --> 56:23.212
Anything you want, all right.

56:23.296 --> 56:24.338
Anything you want!

56:25.131 --> 56:27.007
Anything! Shoot him, Allan!

56:27.133 --> 56:28.175
Don't listen to him!

56:28.301 --> 56:29.343
Don't you fucking listen to him!

56:29.803 --> 56:32.471
Do it. Allan, do it. Please! Please don't!

56:33.473 --> 56:34.890
Do it! Do it! I don't want to!

56:34.974 --> 56:36.558
Shoot him, Allan! Don't fucking kill me!

56:36.643 --> 56:37.726
Shoot him, you fucking pussy!

56:37.811 --> 56:39.311
Shoot him! Please don't!

56:39.479 --> 56:41.230
See, I'm not like you! No!

56:41.481 --> 56:42.564
Fuck!

56:50.532 --> 56:53.325
Fuck. You motherfucker.

56:53.827 --> 56:55.744
Oh, now you're showing initiative?

56:59.666 --> 57:01.250
I like it, Allan.

57:02.669 --> 57:03.710
Yes.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.672
Do it. Shoot me.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.091
I'm not a killer.

57:09.175 --> 57:10.509
Neither was I once.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.345
But you'll get there.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.852
Unless you physically stop me, this list gets completed.

57:20.353 --> 57:21.437
No. Yes.

57:22.772 --> 57:26.024
We work our way up. Number one is still the priority.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.068
No! You don't hurt her! You hear me?

57:29.112 --> 57:30.237
God, no!

(SIREN WAILS) Stop! Stop! He's inside!

57:54.721 --> 57:55.929
He's inside! Drop the gun!

57:56.055 --> 57:58.390
Drop the gun right now! Drop the
gun! He's in there! He just shot...

57:58.892 --> 58:00.392
Drop the gun right now! Face away from me!

58:00.602 --> 58:02.102
Listen to me! He's right fucking there.

58:02.228 --> 58:05.230
Drop the gun! Face away from
me! Face away from me!

Okay. Get down on your knees!

Get down! Get down! Get down!

You gotta believe me! He's right there!

Hands out to the side!

58:14.908 --> 58:16.575
He's right inside! Hands out to the side!

58:16.659 --> 58:18.285
Stay right there! Get your hands out to the side!

door! Where are you?

58:43.937 --> 58:48.357
Son of a bitch! Where the fuck are you?

58:54.030 --> 58:55.614
Please, you need to help me find my wife. You...

58:55.698 --> 58:57.157
Settle down. Settle down, hotrod.

58:57.283 --> 58:58.659
We need to find my wife, you hear...

58:58.785 --> 58:59.868
She's fine.

59:00.119 --> 59:01.787
She's upstairs. She's fine.

59:01.871 --> 59:02.955
She what?

59:03.289 --> 59:04.706
Take a seat.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.209
We picked her up after your little incident downtown.

59:07.293 --> 59:09.545
I figured, with the body count you're
leaving in your wake today,

59:09.963 --> 59:11.547
keeping her with us was a pretty safe bet.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.425
What's your relationship to Mike Dodd?

59:15.510 --> 59:16.969
He's a friend of mine. Listen, he's in trouble.

59:17.053 --> 59:19.638
Okay, you need to find him. He's
number two on the list. All right?

59:19.722 --> 59:21.139
You mean this list?

59:21.224 --> 59:22.683
Jesus.

59:23.226 --> 59:26.353
Don't worry, I'm sending a car
over to pick him up. Sit down.

(COUGHING)

59:34.904 --> 59:36.905
Now what the fuck is going on here, Campbell?

59:37.657 --> 59:41.243
You got ties to at least two of these
vics and possibly a third.

59:41.327 --> 59:43.870
I got one dead cop and you at the scene waving a gun.

59:43.997 --> 59:45.247
Listen, I tried to tell you...

59:45.331 --> 59:46.582
No, you told me a joke.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.418
Two guys walk into a bar. Fucking hilarious.

59:51.254 --> 59:52.337
The shooter, Campbell.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.672
Who is he?

59:55.174 --> 59:56.341
His name is Jonas.

59:56.801 --> 59:57.884
You got a last name?

59:58.011 --> 59:59.803
No. I... I don't know.

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:04.349
(SIGHING)

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:06.059
Well, how the hell do you fit into all this?

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:09.896
Because if I'm perfectly honest, from where I stand,

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.899
you could very much look like an accessory.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:17.988
Okay, I told you I went into a bar last
night, and I wanted to have a few...

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.865
No, no, no. You told me that you were at home

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:21.033
with your wife last night.

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:22.534
And so did she.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.163
She said that?

01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:30.292
You better start cutting me a clue here, Campbell.

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:32.044
What's your relationship to this Jonas?

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:35.213
There is no relationship. Okay?

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:37.716
Please just trust me. All right?

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:40.927
I went into a bar. I got a little drunk.
I wanted to talk to somebody.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.848
I thought all this was... It was just a joke.

01:00:44.932 --> 01:00:48.435
Then I woke up in the morning
in my car. I went into work

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:14.929
The choice is mine to make.

01:22:15.847 --> 01:22:17.973
I knew you had it in you.

Nobody move! Let me see your hands!

Get down! Get down!

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:49.171
Stand down! Stand down!

WOMAN: (ON TV) The hostage situation

01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:22.222
at the police station in Spokane, Washington,

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.891
ended early this morning

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:28.353
when Metro SWAT engaged and
killed the suspect, Jonas Arbor.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:30.981
Arbor's hostages, Allan and Sydney Campbell,

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.276
suffered non-life-threatening
injuries during their ordeal

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.987
and are now safely recovering at a local hospital.

01:24:37.655 --> 01:24:41.366
It could be several days until the full death
toll from the rampage is known.

01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:45.287
At this time, 18 deaths have been reported.

01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:47.998
Three of the bodies are still unidentified.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.960
It's now believed Campbell is innocent
of any criminal involvement with Arbor

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:56.090
and was simply an unwilling participant
in Arbor's deadly game.
