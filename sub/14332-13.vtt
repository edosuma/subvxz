[humming]
- MORNING, TURNER.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.101
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF CHANGING YOUR OIL.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.937
- YOU MONSTER.
I LIKED MY OLD OIL.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.273

GAVE ME THAT BLOOD TRANSFUSION

01:13.339 --> 01:14.340

01:23.483 --> 01:24.417
SO ANGRY.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.552
I'VE GOT TO GET A GRIP,

01:25.618 --> 01:26.719
ACT LIKE A GROWNUP,
AND GO SOMEPLACE

01:26.786 --> 01:29.589

YOU AND ME BOTH, BROTHER.

YOU'RE TIMMY'S TEACHER
MR. CRACKERS.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.574
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

01:47.640 --> 01:49.008
- LIKE YOU,
I NEED TO CALM DOWN.

01:49.075 --> 01:50.477
MY LIFE IS A JOKE.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.045

WITH MAGICAL CREATURES

01:52.111 --> 01:53.346
THAT I CAN NEVER CATCH.

01:53.413 --> 01:54.647

01:54.714 --> 01:55.915
TO NOWHERE.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.383
- IS NOWHERE A STORE
IN THE MALL?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.285
- NO!
YOU'RE THINKING OF GO WEAR!,

01:59.352 --> 02:01.521
THE CLOTHING STORE
FOR ACTIVE SENIORS.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.523
- [exclaims and laughs]

MR. KRAKEN.

NAMED DINKLEBERG

02:11.131 --> 02:12.665

CAN HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.304
I'LL GET RID OF YOUR NEIGHBOR
IF YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.706
BRING ME TIMMY'S FISH.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.875
I'VE COME TO BELIEVE
THEY'RE FAIRIES!

02:21.941 --> 02:23.343

THEY'LL GRANT ME,

02:23.409 --> 02:24.844

MR. CRACKPOT.

- ONLY YOU CALL ME THAT.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.616
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

02:29.682 --> 02:31.184
- THROW IN A GIFT CARD
TO GO WEAR!

02:31.251 --> 02:32.519
AND WE'VE GOT A DEAL.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.320
- UH-OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.356
- I'LL SAY.
MY DAD AND MR. CROCKER

02:36.422 --> 02:38.057
MAKING A DEAL
MEANS TROUBLE.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.627

ABOUT MY LICORICE--MEH!

02:40.693 --> 02:42.195
IT TASTES LIKE CHEAP LEATHER.

02:42.262 --> 02:45.398
- COSMO, THAT'S YOUR BELT.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.901
- OH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
THIS PIECE OF LICORICE

02:47.967 --> 02:49.168
HOLDING UP MY PANTS.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.037
- I'M WORRIED.
KNOWING MR. CROCKER,

02:51.104 --> 02:53.406
HE'S PROBABLY GETTING MY DAD
TO DO SOMETHING BAD.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.441
- YEAH, LIKE MAKING HIM TAKE
ANOTHER RIDE

02:55.508 --> 02:57.877
IN THAT DIRTY KIDDY TRAIN.
[shudders]

02:57.944 --> 02:59.679
THAT THING'LL GIVE YOU PINK EYE.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.848

THROUGH THE UNRELENTING ITCHING

03:01.915 --> 03:03.383
OF PINK EYE
TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE

03:03.449 --> 03:05.184
OF OPERATION:
ELIMINATE DINKLEBERG!

03:05.251 --> 03:07.086
I BUILT A REPLICA
OF DINKLEBERG'S HOUSE

03:07.153 --> 03:08.555
ON A MISSILE TESTING SITE.

03:08.621 --> 03:09.889
NOW FOR PHASE TWO.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.158
I'LL LAUNCH
MY GLOBAL POSITIONING SATELLITE

03:12.225 --> 03:14.260
THAT WILL REDIRECT DINKLEBERG
TO HIS FAKE HOME,

03:14.327 --> 03:17.697
WHERE HE'LL BE ANNIHILATED.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.833
[cackles]

03:20.900 --> 03:24.237
- DENZEL, THERE'S A ROCKET
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.605
- HOP ON, YOU OLD BAT.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.774
IT'S YOUR RIDE
TO SHUFFLEBOARD PRACTICE.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.910
IN SPACE, NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU
RUIN MY LIFE!

03:30.977 --> 03:33.313
- [screams]
DENZEL, WHY?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.480
- NOW TO MAKE SURE
TURNER'S DAD

03:34.547 --> 03:36.282
IS KEEPING UP HIS END
OF THE BARGAIN.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.684
[cell phone ringing]
HEY, TURNER.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.519
JUST CHECKING TO SEE
HOW FAR YOU'VE GOTTEN.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.255
- WELL, MR. CRANKCASE,
I JUST PASSED THE FOOD COURT,

03:42.322 --> 03:43.756
AND I'M HEADING
TOWARD MIDLIFE PRICES,

03:43.823 --> 03:46.125
THE DISCOUNT STORE
FOR MIDDLE-AGED MEN.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.760
- GAH!
YOU'RE STILL AT THE MALL?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.529
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET RID
OF DINKLEBERG,

03:49.596 --> 03:53.333
YOU BETTER GET YOUR CABOOSE
OFF THAT CABOOSE!

03:53.399 --> 03:55.668
- GUYS, I'M NERVOUS
ABOUT CROCKER AND MY DAD.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.504
I SENT SPARKY TO SPY ON THEM
TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.540
- HEY, TIMMY,
I JUST GOT BACK FROM SPYING

04:00.607 --> 04:02.609
ON YOUR DAD AND MR. CROCKER
AT THE CARNIVAL.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.444
- THEY'RE NOT AT THE CARNIVAL.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.578
- THAT'S WHAT I CAME
TO TELL YOU.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.413
ANYWAY, I GOT TO GET BACK.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.316
I'M HEADLINING THE SIDESHOW
AS THE INCREDIBLE TALKING DOG.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.718
I'M MAKING A FORTUNE.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.087
ALSO I GOT THE BEARDED LADY'S
PHONE NUMBER.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.725
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:18.791 --> 04:21.494
- YOU MEAN WITH MY LIFE
OR RIGHT NOW?

04:21.560 --> 04:23.162
'CAUSE THE ANSWER TO BOTH
IS NOTHING.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.498
- AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH MR. CROCKER TODAY?

04:25.565 --> 04:28.301
- WELL, I WASN'T STRIKING A DEAL
TO SWAP YOUR FISH

04:28.368 --> 04:29.535
FOR DINKLEBERG'S DOOM.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.837
ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED NOTE,

04:30.903 --> 04:32.038
CAN I HAVE YOUR FISH?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.974
- SURE, DAD.
THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.110
I WISH YOU GUYS WERE REPLACED
BY A WOLVERINE.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.581
HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS, TIMMY!

04:41.648 --> 04:44.283
OOH, MY SPY WIRE'S
NOT WORKING.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.519
COULD YOU CUT ME DOWN
SO I CAN WALK OUT?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.722
- ONCE I GET THOSE FISH,

04:49.789 --> 04:52.125
I'LL WISH FOR MOTHER TO BE SENT
TO AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE

04:52.191 --> 04:53.826
WHERE SHE'S HUNTED
BY INTELLIGENT APES.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.728
THEN I'LL WISH
FOR MY LIFE'S DREAM--

04:55.795 --> 04:57.497
A GIANT BAG OF ONIONS.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.265
I'LL USE THEM TO MAKE RECIPES
FOR MY SELF-PUBLISHED

<i>I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING</i>

05:04.270 --> 05:05.438
I GOT TIMMY'S FISH.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.806
- OH, HAPPY DAY.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.409
I COULD CRY,
AND I'M NOT EVEN EATING ONIONS.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.179
- [growls]
- AH, WOLVERINE!

05:13.246 --> 05:16.182
- WOW, TIMMY'S HAIRY FISH
SEEMS TO HATE YOU.

WHILE I TAKE CARE OF DINKLEBERG.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.621
- [growls]
- [screams]

05:24.924 --> 05:26.726
[yelling]

05:26.793 --> 05:28.394
- NOW FOR PHASE THREE.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.696
ONCE I PUSH THIS BUTTON,

05:29.762 --> 05:30.997
I'LL REDIRECT THE GPS

05:31.064 --> 05:32.098
IN DINKLEBERG'S PHONE

05:32.165 --> 05:33.499
AND SEND HIM
TO HIS FAKE HOUSE,

05:33.566 --> 05:35.935
WHERE HE'LL BE ANNIHILATED.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.537

05:42.542 --> 05:44.777
YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY BAD BUMP
ON YOUR BACK.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.012
- THAT'S NOT FROM THE ACCIDENT.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.246
THAT'S MY HUMP.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.449
- NO, IT'S JUST
A GIANT TENSION KNOT.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.684
LUCKY FOR YOU I'M TRAINED
IN THE ANCIENT CHINESE ART

05:51.751 --> 05:52.919

06:03.463 --> 06:05.331
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
NEW BEST FRIEND?

06:05.398 --> 06:07.166
- DINKLEBERG.
- GAH!

06:07.233 --> 06:08.668
- NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. GAH.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.236
WOULD YOU LIKE
A GIANT BAG OF ONIONS?

06:10.303 --> 06:12.538
I WAS AT THE SUPERMARKET,
AND I ALWAYS BUY TWO

06:12.605 --> 06:14.974
IN CASE I RESCUE AN ONION LOVER
FROM CERTAIN DEATH.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.242
- ONIONS?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.411
DID THAT BUS HIT ME AND KNOCK ME
INTO HEAVEN?

06:18.478 --> 06:19.746
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.147
- NO.
NO ANGEL.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.950
JUST A GOOD SAMARITAN
WITH SUPER-HUMAN REFLEXES.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.052
HEY, WHAT'S
THAT FANCY REMOTE FOR?

06:26.119 --> 06:28.888
- NOTHING, AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA PUSH IT NOW.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.790
WANT TO DROP BY FOR BREAKFAST
TOMORROW, FRIEND?

06:30.857 --> 06:32.058
MOTHER WON'T BOTHER US.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.294
SHE'S IN SPACE
PLAYING SHUFFLEBOARD.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.130
- OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY
TO GET SOME REST.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.698
BUT WITH MY DAD
AFTER YOU GUYS,

06:38.765 --> 06:40.433
I DOUBT I'LL GET
ANY SLEEP.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.235
[snores]

06:42.301 --> 06:45.104
- WE'D BETTER KEEP AN EYE OUT

YOU AND POOF GET SOME SLEEP.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.711

CASTLE DOOR ALWAYS WEARS ME OUT.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.247

THE NIGHT VISION

06:59.619 --> 07:00.820

07:04.524 --> 07:06.292
LOOKS LIKE I BROKE INTO THE ZOO
FOR NOTHING.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.661
I'LL JUST FEEL AROUND

07:09.829 --> 07:13.933

- AND I'M THE ONE
WHO BOUGHT IT.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.367
- [weeps]

07:48.434 --> 07:49.802
YOU COMPLETE ME.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.637
- YOU KNOW, I'M DEATHLY ALLERGIC
TO ONIONS,

07:51.704 --> 07:55.107
BUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS MORE
TO ME THAN MY OWN LIFE.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.243
WELL, BETTER GO HOME
AND TAKE AN ICE BATH

07:57.310 --> 07:58.678
BEFORE MY WINDPIPE SWELLS SHUT.

07:58.744 --> 07:59.779
SEE YOU SOON, FRIEND.

07:59.846 --> 08:03.015
- YOU BET, GOOD BUDDY.
[sighs]

08:03.082 --> 08:04.951
- MR. CRAWLSPACE,
I GOT THE FISH.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.720
FYI, IF THE ZOO POLICE COME BY
ASKING ABOUT AN OWL,

08:07.787 --> 08:09.188
I WAS NEVER HERE.

08:09.255 --> 08:10.990
- SORRY, TURNER.
THE DEAL'S OFF.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.792
I'M NOT GETTING RID
OF DINKLEBERG.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.727
HE'S BETTER THAN HAVING FAIRIES!

08:14.794 --> 08:16.529
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M PUSHING THIS BUTTON

08:16.596 --> 08:18.130
THAT WILL REDIRECT HIM
TO HIS FAKE HOUSE

08:18.197 --> 08:19.732
IN THE MISSILE SITE.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.000
- THEN I WILL.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.770
SAYONARA, DINKLEBERG.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.806
- GAH!
I'VE GOT TO SAVE MY BESTIE!

08:26.873 --> 08:29.575
LOOK, IT'S THE ZOO POLICE.
HIDE.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.077
- [exclaims]
- YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP

08:31.143 --> 08:33.279
PRETTY EARLY IN THE MORNING
TO FOOL DENZEL CRAWLSPACE.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.014
GAH!
I'M DOING IT AGAIN.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.119
- THAT'S FUNNY.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.120
I DON'T REMEMBER
LIVING IN THE DESERT.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.624
BUT MY GPS DOESN'T LIE.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.959
- STOP!
I'VE DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLE!

08:47.026 --> 08:49.328
- I'LL SAY.
YOU HAVEN'T AUTOGRAPHED MY COPY

08:49.395 --> 08:50.563
OF YOUR WONDERFUL COOKBOOK.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.398
COME ON INSIDE.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.734
- OH, WELL.
HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.004
OH, POOPY!

08:58.070 --> 09:00.439
- LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT, GUYS.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.275
GUYS?

09:02.341 --> 09:04.710
OH, NO, MY FAIRIES
MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP,

09:04.777 --> 09:06.012
AND MY DAD GOT THEM.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.313
- NO WORRIES, TIMMY.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.582
I'M A DOG.
I CAN TRACK THEM DOWN.

09:09.649 --> 09:13.019
HELLO, POLICE, I'D LIKE
TO REPORT SOME MISSING FISH.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.455
NO, I'M NOT THE DOG THE BEARDED
LADY COMPLAINED ABOUT.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.157
UH, SORRY, TIMMY.
DEAD END.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.759
- CAN'T YOU JUST FOLLOW
THEIR SCENT?

09:19.825 --> 09:22.128
- THAT'S JUST CRAZY ENOUGH
TO WORK.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.131
- [sighs]

09:25.197 --> 09:27.300
- OH, NO, WE ONLY HAVE
FIVE MINUTES.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.302
I GOT TO FIND A WAY OUT.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.203
[screams]
- CALM DOWN, FRIEND.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.272
YOUR TENSION HUMP
IS COMING BACK.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.010
- COSMO, WANDA,
AND POOF ARE IN THERE.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.312
- GOOD WORK, SPARKY.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.180
BUT ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
ARE SEALED SHUT.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.648
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET IN?

09:42.715 --> 09:46.152
- ATTENTION, ANYONE STUPID
ENOUGH TO BE IN THIS AREA:

09:46.218 --> 09:49.622
THE MISSILE LAUNCH IS
IN THREE MINUTES AND COUNTING.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.757
- OH, NO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

09:51.824 --> 09:53.759
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.
I'M A DOG.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.394
I'LL USE MY PHONE TO HACK
INTO THE LAUNCH CODES

09:55.461 --> 09:57.730
AND REDIRECT--
OH, SHOOT, NO BARS.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.999
- WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST DIG
YOUR WAY INTO THE HOUSE?

10:00.066 --> 10:02.668
- THAT'S JUST CRAZY ENOUGH
TO WORK.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.673
- [sighs]

10:07.740 --> 10:09.508
- GAH, I'M TRAPPED!

10:09.575 --> 10:12.712
- OH, DEAR, HE'S SO UPSET
HE'S TALKING TO HIMSELF.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.013
GAH, COME IN HERE.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.351
I POURED YOU A SOOTHING CUP
OF ONION TEA.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.720
OH, HI, TIMMY.
NO NEED TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.022
I DON'T WANT TO PRY.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.757
- [snores]

10:24.824 --> 10:27.793
- GUYS, WAKE UP.
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.061
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.162
WITH ME ON GUARD,
YOUR DAD

10:30.229 --> 10:31.664
WILL NEVER GET HIS HANDS
ON US.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.901
- JUST POOF US ALL OUT OF HERE.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.570
- I JIMMIED OPEN
THE BACK DOOR!

10:37.636 --> 10:38.604
LET'S SCRAM!

10:38.671 --> 10:41.073
OOH, SOOTHING ONION TEA.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.675
[sighs]

10:44.777 --> 10:45.845
GAH!

10:45.911 --> 10:47.446
WELL, MIGHT
AS WELL GET COMFORTABLE

10:47.513 --> 10:49.548
UNTIL THE AMBULANCE COMES.

10:49.615 --> 10:52.418
[fairies crying]

10:52.485 --> 10:54.487
- OH, THERE'S NO REASON
TO CRY, GUYS.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.922
MR. DINKLEBERG'S SAFE
IN HIS REAL HOME.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.691
AND YOU GUYS ARE SAFE WITH ME.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.292
- THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE CRYING.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.829
MR. DINKLEBERG SPILLED ONION TEA
IN THE FISHBOWL.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.531
- WE JUST HAVE TO FIND MY DAD
TO MAKE SURE

11:05.598 --> 11:09.035
HE DOESN'T MAKE
ANY MORE STUPID DEALS.

11:09.101 --> 11:12.405
- OOH, THAT MONSTER DINKLEBERG
DIDN'T GET ANNIHILATED.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.640
I'M SO MAD, I'VE GOT
TO LET OFF SOME STEAM.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.343
[toots horn]
- YOU AND ME BOTH, BROTHER.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.346
MY SON SHOT ME INTO SPACE,
AND MY SHUFFLEBOARD SWEATS

11:20.413 --> 11:22.214
BURST INTO FLAMES
UPON REENTRY.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.216
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.685
- FINE, MRS. CRABCAKES,
BUT FIRST I'VE GOT A SCORE

11:26.752 --> 11:28.554
TO SETTLE WITH A SPOTTED OWL.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.756
- WHO!
- A SPOTTED OWL!

11:30.823 --> 11:32.858
- WAIT, MRS. CORNDOG,
YOUR LIPS DIDN'T MOVE.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.527
WHO SAID THAT?
- WHO!

11:34.593 --> 11:36.595
- [shouts]

11:36.662 --> 11:37.596
[train whistle blows]

11:52.545 --> 11:53.979
- [snores]

11:54.046 --> 11:55.514
- WAKE UP, TIMMY!

11:55.581 --> 11:56.649
THE SUN IS SHINING,

11:56.715 --> 11:58.284
THE BIRDS ARE SINGING,

11:58.350 --> 12:01.387
AND THERE'S A GIANT FLOATING
HEAD OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.756
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHY ARE THE BIRDS SINGING?

12:03.823 --> 12:05.491
SOMETHING'S TERRIBLY WRONG!

12:05.558 --> 12:08.861
- WHOA, IT'S THE FATHER SHIP
FROM THE PLANET OF THE DADS.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.329
- PLANET OF THE DADS?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.198
- TIMMY WISHED
FOR A BUNCH OF DADS,

12:12.264 --> 12:13.699
AND THINGS GOT OUT OF CONTROL,

12:13.766 --> 12:15.935
SO WE POOFED THEM
TO THEIR OWN PLANET.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.370
- IT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF TIMMY'S
POORLY-CONCEIVED WISHES

12:18.437 --> 12:20.406
THAT CAME BACK TO BITE HIM
IN THE BUTT.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.775
LIKE BERNIE,
THE BUTT-BITING BABOON.

12:22.842 --> 12:23.976
[screams]
GREAT.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.245
NOW MY PANTS
SMELL LIKE BANANAS.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.346
- HI, TIMMY.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.948
IT'S PRESIDENT DAD,

12:29.014 --> 12:30.950
AND I'M HERE TO INVITE YOU
TO "TAKE YOUR KID TO WORK" DAY

12:31.016 --> 12:32.685
ON THE PLANET OF THE DADS.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.221
YOU'LL GET TO COME TO WORK
WITH ME AND SEE WHAT I DO.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.057
WHICH WOULD HELP, BECAUSE I'M
NOT ACTUALLY SURE WHAT I DO.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.391
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.960
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING
I REALLY WANNA--

12:41.026 --> 12:41.961
- YOU GET TO MISS SCHOOL.

12:42.027 --> 12:43.796
- LET'S DO THIS.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.232
- TIMMY,
YOU SHOULDN'T SKIP SCHOOL.

12:46.298 --> 12:49.068
BESIDES, YOUR PARENTS
WILL WONDER WHERE YOU ARE.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.569
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

12:50.636 --> 12:51.837
I'LL SEND DOWN DEADBEAT DAD

12:51.904 --> 12:53.739
TO FILL IN FOR TIMMY
WHILE HE'S GONE.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.207
DEADBEAT DAD CAN'T BRING TIMMY
TO WORK

12:55.274 --> 12:57.510
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
A REAL JOB.

12:57.576 --> 13:00.045
HE'S A "MUSICIAN."

13:04.316 --> 13:06.152
- 'SUP, DUDES?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.386
GOT ANY KELP CHIPS?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.588
GOT TO KEEP THIS ACTION TIGHT.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.892
- OH, DON'T WORRY, GUYS.
I SPEAK UNEMPLOYED MUSICIAN.

13:12.958 --> 13:17.129
CAN I CRASH ON YOUR COUCH
FOR A WHILE?

13:17.196 --> 13:20.132
- THERE'S NO WAY THIS GUY
CAN PASS FOR TIMMY.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.067
- DON'T FREAK OUT,
LITTLE DUDETTE.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.203
CHECK IT.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.571
- TIMMY, IS THAT YOU?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.839
- I'M OVER HERE.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.008
- WHA--?
TWO TIMMYS?

13:29.074 --> 13:30.643
YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.245
- WELL, IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
TO FOOL COSMO--

13:33.312 --> 13:36.849
- A LAMP WITH A PINK HAT ON IT
WOULD FOOL COSMO.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.251
- WHOA! THREE TIMMYS?

13:39.318 --> 13:40.686
YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.288
[screeches]

13:42.354 --> 13:44.323
- AND I'M BLOWING OFF SCHOOL.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.127
GUYS, POOF ME
TO THE FATHER SHIP.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.428
- [chortles]

13:49.495 --> 13:52.431
I'M SO EXCITED TO FIND OUT
WHAT I DO.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.270
- HEY, DUDES.
GOT ANY GLUTEN-FREE BROWNIES?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.973
THE GLUTEN HAS TO BE FREE
'CAUSE I CAN'T PAY FOR IT.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.609
- TIMMY, THERE'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.977
- OH, THERE SURE IS.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.279
HE'S BECOME
FANTASTICALLY HANDSOME.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.648
- YOU'RE NOT SO BAD
YOURSELF, POPS.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.284
[eerie space music]

14:12.351 --> 14:15.454
- I LOVE COMING TO WORK
WITH YOU, PRESIDENT DAD.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.023
- GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE
AT MY JOB, TIMMY.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.125
NOW, IF YOU COULD JUST TELL ME
WHAT MY JOB IS,

14:20.192 --> 14:21.860
WE CAN GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.128
OH, WAIT!

14:23.195 --> 14:24.830
DO I DO SHOWS
AND TAKE THEM ON THE ROAD?

14:24.897 --> 14:27.466
- NO, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT,
AND YOU MAKE LAWS.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.801
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.337
I HEREBY DECLARE
HOMEWORK IS ILLEGAL,

14:31.403 --> 14:32.805
EVERY DAY IS CHRISTMAS,

14:32.871 --> 14:36.008
AND TAX LOOPHOLES ARE CLOSED
TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.443
I THREW THAT IN
TO KEEP IT REAL.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.144
MAKING LAWS IS FUN!

14:39.211 --> 14:40.579
- IT SURE IS, TIMMY.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.348
AND ALL YOU NEED
IS A FANCY GAVEL

14:42.414 --> 14:43.849
AND A HEALTHY DOSE
OF POWER MADNESS.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.050
[alarm beeps]
- TIME'S UP!

14:45.117 --> 14:47.319
IT'S MY TURN TO TAKE TIMMY
TO WORK.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.322
- COOL! ANOTHER DAD,
ANOTHER AWESOME JOB.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.690
YOU'RE A WHAT?

14:51.757 --> 14:53.158
- A VEGETABLE TASTER.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.561
NOW, TAKE A BIG BITE
OF THESE BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.830
YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE ORGANIC
'CAUSE THEY'RE COVERED IN DIRT.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.732
- TIME'S UP.
LET'S GO, TIMMY.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.834
- OH, WELL, I HAVE TO GO
TO ANOTHER JOB

15:01.900 --> 15:04.036
THAT'S HOPEFULLY MORE AWESOME
THAN THIS ONE.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.939
THIS IS YOUR JOB--
BEING CHASED BY A BEAR?

15:07.006 --> 15:08.907
- WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN MY OLD JOB--

15:08.974 --> 15:10.709
BEING MAULED BY A BEAR!

15:10.776 --> 15:12.278
[bear snarls]

15:12.344 --> 15:14.780
- LOOK AT ALL THESE DADS
WAITING TO TAKE ME

15:14.847 --> 15:16.382
TO THEIR CRUMMY JOBS.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.051
- I THOUGHT THE EYEBROW WAXER
WAS PRETTY COOL.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.353
- THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GO
TO ALL THOSE JOBS.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.223
THERE ARE 5,000 DADS
AND JUST ONE OF ME.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.692
- TIMMY, YOU'RE FORGETTING
THERE ARE TWO OF YOU.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.294
WHAT ABOUT THE TIMMY
BACK ON EARTH?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.596
- THAT'S JUST DEADBEAT DAD
IN A PINK HAT.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.466
HONESTLY, IF I WORE A PINK HAT,
WOULD YOU THINK I WAS TIMMY?

15:34.533 --> 15:35.934
- DON'T BE SILLY.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.203
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A LAMP
WITH WEIRD EYEBROWS.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.873
- I'VE GOT IT!
I'LL WISH FOR MORE TIMMYS.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.776
THAT WAY, EACH DAD WILL HAVE ONE
TO TAKE TO WORK.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.478
- OH, I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THIS, SPORT.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.881
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO CLONE YOURSELF?

15:48.947 --> 15:51.383
- THE SURPRISED-LOOKING LAMP
MAKES A GOOD POINT, TIMMY.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.785
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

15:52.851 --> 15:55.554
I WISH THERE WAS A TIMMY
FOR EVERY DAD.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.559
- COME TO WORK WITH US,
TIMMY.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.627
- I'M AN ALLIGATOR DENTIST.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.429
- I'M A NOSE HAIR STYLIST.

16:03.495 --> 16:06.465
- I'M A LINGERIE MODEL.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.867
- THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD
POSSIBLY GO WRONG.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.302
NOW LET'S GET BACK TO EARTH.

16:10.369 --> 16:14.373
HOW DO I GET THE IMAGE
OF THE LAST JOB OUT OF MY HEAD?

16:14.440 --> 16:17.109
- I FEEL WEIRD, GUYS--
LIKE SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.678
- WHOOPSIE,
I LEFT WANDA BEHIND.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.513
HEY, TIMMYS,
WHY THE LONG FACES?

16:21.580 --> 16:24.316
- WE FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S
MISSING FROM OUR LIVES.

16:24.383 --> 16:25.484
- WELL, DUH.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.985
YOU DON'T HAVE
MAGICAL FAIRIES

Timmys: FAIRIES?

16:33.258 --> 16:36.862
- WOW, THAT WAS A LOT MORE WORK
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.264
WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER
TO JUST GO TO SCHOOL.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.933
- UH, SPEAKING OF SCHOOL,

16:40.999 --> 16:43.168
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO,
SPORT.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.903

16:44.970 --> 16:46.839
SINCE DEADBEAT DAD'S COVERING

THE REST OF MY DAY'S GONNA BE

16:49.408 --> 16:51.210
EXCEPT I'M NOT GONNA BE
AT THE PARK.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.513
I'M GONNA SIT ON A BENCH

17:07.126 --> 17:09.228
I'VE GOT MY MUSIC.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.797

CAN HEAR THAT, RIGHT?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.031
[screams]

[crows cawing]

17:17.368 --> 17:19.238
- TIMMY TURNER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

17:19.304 --> 17:20.873
FOR DITCHING SCHOOL.

17:20.939 --> 17:24.175
WHOA, TWO TIMMYS?
YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.582
TWO TIMMYS
IS TWICE THE BOUNTY.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.584
NOW I CAN AFFORD THE NEW LEAF
BLOWER ATTACHMENT

17:32.651 --> 17:33.752
FOR MY HAND.

17:33.819 --> 17:34.887
YAY.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.322
- OH, NO,
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.757
- DON'T WORRY, LITTLE DUDE.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.959
WITH A FEW TAPESTRIES,
THIS VAN COULD BE PRETTY CHILL.

17:41.026 --> 17:44.430
CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY
FOR TAPESTRIES?

17:44.496 --> 17:46.365
[eerie space music]

17:46.432 --> 17:48.233
- COSMO, WANDA,
WE NEED TO GO

17:48.300 --> 17:50.102
BACK TO THE PLANET
OF THE DADS.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.104
- WHY?
- UH, WHY NOT?

17:52.171 --> 17:55.107
- CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT LOGIC.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.545
- NOW I WISH YOU GUYS
WERE IN SHACKLES

17:59.611 --> 18:00.712
SO YOU CAN'T ESCAPE.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.282
- WHY?
- UM, WHY NOT?

18:03.348 --> 18:07.986
- CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT LOGIC EITHER.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.955
Timmys: [cheering]

18:10.022 --> 18:11.857
- COSMO, WE'VE BEEN TRICKED.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.092
BUT BECAUSE ALL OF THEM

18:14.159 --> 18:15.961
WE HAVE TO GRANT THE WISHES.

ARE BLOWING MY MIND.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.480
AND MY WAND!

18:34.546 --> 18:37.649
- BOY, THAT LEAF BLOWER
ATTACHMENT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.852
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE CLEANEST YARD IN TOWN.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.154
I FEEL SO ALIVE.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.423
- HEY, CAN YOU DROP ME OFF
AT THE RAINBOW ROOM,

18:44.490 --> 18:45.557
MR. SHALLOWWATER?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.459
I GOTTA MEET A CHICK
NAMED CHEYENNE.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.896
- THE ONLY PLACE YOU'RE GOING
IS JUVENILE HALL, PUNK.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.633
- COSMO, WANDA, NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO SHOW UP.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.201
SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.838
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE
AND FIND THEM.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.007
- IS THAT AIR GUITAR?

19:02.074 --> 19:03.442
I HATE AIR GUITAR.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.111
IT'S THE HOBBY OF NITWITS
AND SLACKERS.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.914
- YOU CAN HEAR THAT?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.950
- AAH! IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!

19:12.017 --> 19:14.520
NOW I'VE GOT THE SONG
STUCK IN MY HEAD.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.664
I DON'T SPEAK
UNEMPLOYED MUSICIAN.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.966

19:30.736 --> 19:34.006
BERNIE AND I WERE ENJOYING
A LITTLE ME TIME.

19:34.072 --> 19:35.507
- ANYWAY, THAT WASN'T ME.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.809
A WISHED-UP TIMMY MUST HAVE
TRICKED MY FAIRIES.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.311
WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.179
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET
TO THE PLANET OF THE DADS

19:41.246 --> 19:42.414
WITHOUT MAGIC?

19:42.481 --> 19:45.317
- IN MY PRIMO ROCKET-POWERED
PARTY VAN!

19:45.384 --> 19:46.785
[cool rock music]

19:46.852 --> 19:49.021

Timmys: [cheering]

19:58.697 --> 19:59.831

19:59.898 --> 20:01.867
COSMO AND WANDA'S WANDS
ARE OVERHEATING.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.069
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING FAST,
THEY'LL EXPLODE,

20:04.136 --> 20:05.837
AND MY FAIRIES
WILL BE GONERS.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.840
WE GOTTA LURE THE TIMMYS
AWAY SOMEHOW.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.076
WHAT'S SOMETHING THE TIMMYS
WOULD REALLY LOVE?

20:11.143 --> 20:13.078
- EH, I DON'T KNOW.
I HATE KIDS.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.813

20:14.880 --> 20:16.214
A DOG!

20:16.281 --> 20:17.683

ARE JUST LIKE ME,

20:17.749 --> 20:19.084
THEY'LL LOVE ANYTHING
I LOVE.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.019
AND I LOVE SPARKY.

ABOUT ME?

20:31.797 --> 20:33.031
[screams]

20:33.098 --> 20:36.034
- COSMO, WANDA,
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU HOME.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.170
- HOW DO WE KNOW
YOU'RE THE REAL TIMMY?

20:38.236 --> 20:39.438
- I KNOW HOW HE CAN PROVE IT.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.039
IF YOU'RE THE REAL TIMMY,

20:41.106 --> 20:43.008
YOU'D KNOW THE SHAPE
OF THE BIRTHMARK ON MY BUTT.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.611
- YOU DON'T HAVE
A BIRTHMARK ON YOUR BUTT.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.145
- OH, REALLY?

20:47.212 --> 20:49.314
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M THE REAL COSMO?

20:49.381 --> 20:51.550
- LOOK, SPORT, THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO FIND OUT

20:51.617 --> 20:53.118
IF YOU'RE THE REAL TIMMY.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.820
WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU A TEST.

20:54.886 --> 20:56.822
- A TEST?
AH, COME ON!

20:56.888 --> 20:59.458
DO I HAVE TO STUDY?
I HATE TESTS!

20:59.524 --> 21:00.826
- THAT'S OUR TIMMY.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.362
- IF YOU GUYS HAVE ENOUGH MAGIC
FOR ONE MORE WISH,

21:03.428 --> 21:07.432
THEN I WISH YOU WERE FREE,
AND WE WERE HOME!

21:07.499 --> 21:08.734
YAY!

21:08.800 --> 21:11.136
- I GUESS THIS IS WHERE
WE SAY GOOD-BYE.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.671
DON'T FORGET ME, LITTLE DUDE.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.374
HERE, I GOT YOU
YOUR OWN AIR GUITAR.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.410

I FEEL KIND OF BAD

21:30.689 --> 21:32.624
LEAVING ALL THOSE TIMMYS
BACK ON THE PLANET OF THE DADS

21:32.691 --> 21:33.825
WITHOUT FAIRIES.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.327
HOW CAN I MAKE IT
UP TO THEM?

21:35.394 --> 21:36.828
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

21:36.895 --> 21:40.432
I WISH ALL THE TIMMYS
GOT THEIR OWN PUPPY.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.601
Timmys:
[cheering and laughing]

21:45.137 --> 21:46.471

[alarm beeping]

21:53.078 --> 21:55.280
- [growls]

21:55.347 --> 21:58.016
NONE OF THOSE TIMMYS
ON THAT PLANET ARE IN SCHOOL.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.018
THEY'LL PAY FOR THAT.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.289
- I WANT TO DEDICATE
THIS NEXT SONG

22:04.356 --> 22:08.493
TO A LITTLE LADY
NAMED CHEYENNE.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.696
- NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU!
