Good, children, good.

Remember to feel the clay.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.793
Be one with the clay.

00:42.918 --> 00:43.919
Nice.
Uh-huh.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.758
Put more clay on the balls.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.302
Boys!
What is that?

00:51.427 --> 00:52.636
A reindeer?

00:52.762 --> 00:53.763
You know, I've had it!

00:53.888 --> 00:56.390
You four boys never take
art class seriously!

00:56.515 --> 00:57.391
What a crime.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.436
You think art is not important?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.855
Well, art's just kind of...
for gaywads.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.106
I love art class!

01:04.231 --> 01:05.107
See?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.942
Do you think this is funny?!

01:07.068 --> 01:10.029
Do you think this is funny,
huh?!

01:13.574 --> 01:15.451
Well, you four can
just spend your afternoon

01:15.576 --> 01:17.620
after school here,
making new pottery!

01:19.622 --> 01:20.664
You can't do that.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.416
I certainly can.
I'm your teacher.

01:22.541 --> 01:25.127
You're an <i>art</i> teacher.
- Make it two hours.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.756
Mrs. Dreible thinks
she's so cool.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.341
How dare she talk to us
like that?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.383
Mrph rmhmhm rm.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.302
We can't let her get away
with this.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.721
I think tonight we need to do
something drastic.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.680
Like what?

01:36.806 --> 01:38.599
Like find out
where Mrs. Dreible lives

01:38.724 --> 01:42.728
and go over there and...
T.P. her house.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.064
Mrph!
- T.P. her house?

01:45.189 --> 01:47.191
Toilet paper.
Cover her house in toilet paper.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.275
Oh.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.027
What's the matter, Kyle?
You chicken?

01:53.531 --> 01:55.533
Quiet, boys.
This isn't playtime.

01:55.658 --> 01:56.909
You're being punished.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.954
Fine. But we'll have the last
laugh tonight, art whore.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.498
Yeah.
Payback time, you ugly skank.

02:08.671 --> 02:11.173
You think that's enough?
- Should be fine.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.758
Don't you guys think
this is a little suspicious?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.510
We should buy something else
so it doesn't look obvious.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.219
Okay.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.180
Here we go --
pack of chewing gum.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.057
Hello, boys.
Find everything you need?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.225
Yep.
All set.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.519
Okay. Let's see here.
Toilet paper.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.771
Toilet paper.
And toilet paper.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.440
Toilet paper.
Toilet paper.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.234
So, what are you kids up to
tonight?

02:30.359 --> 02:32.862
Oh, we're just gonna watch some
TV, maybe play a board game.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.405
Nice, relaxing night at home,
huh?

02:34.530 --> 02:36.198
Toilet paper.
Toilet paper.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.408
And toilet paper.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.201
H-Hey.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.412
Now, you kids be careful
with this chewing gum.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.038
Don't go sticking it
under tables.

02:43.164 --> 02:43.914
Okay.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.457
Okay.
Toilet paper.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.043
Toilet paper.
Toilet paper.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.462
You know, son, I remember you
coming in last week

02:50.588 --> 02:52.006
and buying this much
toilet paper.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.424
Oh, yeah.
That -- That's right.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.551
Toilet paper.
Toilet paper.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.344
You T.P.'d a house
last week, Cartman?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.138
No. Last Thursday night
was fajitas night.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.140
Oh.
Ugh.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.354
Is this the right house?

03:07.479 --> 03:09.148
It's the right address.
Wait. Look there.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.734
There's Mrs. Dreible.
This is the place.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.945
Oh, wait, wait.
There's kids inside.

03:15.070 --> 03:15.946
So?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.865
So I'm not T.P.'ing a house
with kids inside it.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.200
Kyle, we all agreed to do this.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.993
We didn't say nothing
about no kids, man.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.286
Kyle, you're being an asshole.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.788
Now let's do this thing
and get out of here.

03:24.914 --> 03:26.957
Here's what I think of your
art class, you Goddamn bitch!

03:27.082 --> 03:28.876
Mrph. Mrph rhrmprhm.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.902
Come on!
Let's go!

03:56.028 --> 03:57.363
What have we done?

03:57.488 --> 03:59.114
Let's go, Kyle!

04:06.497 --> 04:09.333
We're -- We're in trouble.
We're in so much trouble.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.460
Aw, man, that was so awesome!

04:11.585 --> 04:12.628
How can you say that?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.004
Did you see what we did
to their house?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.714
It'll take them days
to clean that up.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.423
Who cares?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.801
Well, you don't, because you're
an uncaring asshole, Cartman.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.761
Me?

04:20.886 --> 04:23.514
There's toilet paper
on your hands, too, Kyle.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.599
Cartman's right, Kyle.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.559
We're all in this together.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.854
No.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.147
No.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.191
No!

04:36.568 --> 04:38.112
Honey, what is it?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.698
Oh, Jesus, no!
Our house!

04:40.823 --> 04:43.659
Mommy. Mommy.
- Mommy. Mommy.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.162
Why? Why?

04:47.288 --> 04:50.207
Aah. Oh, God. Oh, God.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.713
Hey, did you guys hear
what happened last night?

04:55.838 --> 04:58.007
Mrs. Dreible's house
got covered with toilet paper.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.551
Yeah. They say it's gonna take
three weeks to get it all down.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.387
Yeah. Well, old Mrs. Dreible
probably had it coming to her.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.430
I don't know.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.974
I don't think anybody deserves
that kind of brutality.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.184
Well, I understand the people
who did it weren't caught,

05:09.310 --> 05:11.103
so looks like nobody
will ever know the geniuses

05:11.228 --> 05:12.604
who masterminded
that perfect crime.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.442
Okay, children,
let's take our seats.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.068
Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle,
Eric, and Kenny,

05:18.193 --> 05:20.029
the counselor wants to see you
in his office, now.

05:20.154 --> 05:20.988
Damn.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.072
Oh, God.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.616
How the hell did they find out

05:24.742 --> 05:26.076
it was us that T.P.'d
that house?

05:26.201 --> 05:28.037
Will you relax, Kyle?
They've got nothing on us.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.122
As long as we all stick
to our story, we'll be fine.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.458
We'd better go over our story
again so we don't screw it up.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.168
Okay, last night, all four of us

05:34.293 --> 05:36.253
were at the bowling alley
until about 7:30,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.713
at which time we noticed
Ally Sheedy,

05:37.838 --> 05:38.964
the goth chick
from "The Breakfast Club,"

05:39.089 --> 05:39.965
was in the lane next to us,

05:40.090 --> 05:41.175
and we asked her
for her autograph,

05:41.300 --> 05:43.010
but she didn't have a pen,
so we followed her to her car,

05:43.135 --> 05:44.636
but on the way, we were accosted
by five Scientologists

05:44.762 --> 05:46.055
who wanted to give us all
personality tests,

05:46.180 --> 05:47.931
which were administered at the
Scientology center in Denver

05:48.057 --> 05:48.766
until 10:45, at which time

05:48.891 --> 05:50.142
we accidentally boarded
the wrong bus home

05:50.267 --> 05:52.227
and ended up in Rancho de Fritas
Rojos, south of Castle Rock,

05:52.353 --> 05:53.604
and finally got a ride home
with a man

05:53.729 --> 05:55.606
who was missing his left index
finger, named Gary Bushwell,

05:55.731 --> 05:58.359
arriving home at 11:46.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.070
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy
take the personality test?

06:01.195 --> 06:01.945
Yes, dude.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.364
Kyle, it's very simple --

06:03.489 --> 06:04.698
We followed Ally Sheedy
out to her car,

06:04.823 --> 06:06.450
but on the way, we were accosted
by five Scientologists

06:06.575 --> 06:07.910
who wanted to give us all
personality tests,

06:08.035 --> 06:09.787
which were administered at the
Scientology center in Denver

06:09.912 --> 06:10.621
until 10:45, at which time

06:10.746 --> 06:12.039
we accidentally boarded
the wrong bus home

06:12.164 --> 06:13.957
and ended up in Rancho de Fritas
Rojos, south of Castle Rock,

06:14.083 --> 06:15.250
and finally got a ride home
with a man

06:15.376 --> 06:17.127
who was missing his left index
finger, named Gary Bushwell,

06:17.252 --> 06:18.837
arriving home at 11:46 --
You got it?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.632
Uh, I-I --
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

06:21.757 --> 06:23.217
Kyle, just let Cartman
do all the talking, okay?

06:23.342 --> 06:24.593
He's better at being in trouble
than anybody.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.594
Thank you, Stan.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.513
Shh, shh.
Here they come. Here they come.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.723
And so I said,
"That's a terrific joke, Wendy.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.016
Tell us another one."

06:31.141 --> 06:33.602
Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey.
Are you ready to see us now?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.313
We're gonna talk to you
one at a time, boys, m'kay?

06:36.438 --> 06:38.649
Kenny, will you step
into my office, please?

06:38.774 --> 06:39.400
Mrh?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.819
Come on, Kenny.
Let's go, m'kay?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.031
Touché, Mr. Mackey, touché.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.491
Why are they doing us
one at a time?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.076
They want to see
if we mix the story up

06:49.201 --> 06:50.953
and see if somebody
will rat out the other three

06:51.078 --> 06:51.912
for a better deal.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.080
I can get a better deal?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.249
Kyle, so help me God, if you
Jew us out on this one,

06:55.374 --> 06:56.458
I will fucking kill you.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.337
There we go. That should be
about the last of it.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.011
Ex-- Excuse me.
Uh, w-what are you doing?

07:08.137 --> 07:10.264
Crime scene investigation.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.307
There are several footprints
in the snow --

07:12.433 --> 07:13.976
perhaps more than one
perpetrator?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.937
Uh, look, we really don't want
to make a big deal out of this.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.439
Is that the toilet paper there?

07:18.564 --> 07:20.524
I'll need to take those bags
as evidence.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.359
Look, it's just not
that big a deal.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.487
I mean, I toilet-papered houses
myself when I was a kid.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.866
You? So where were you
last night at around 9:00?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.117
I was here.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.202
Aha!
Got you!

07:32.327 --> 07:34.872
Officer, why would I T.P.
my own house?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.248
Insurance?

07:36.373 --> 07:37.791
It wasn't me, okay?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.252
Now, if you don't mind, I want
to get my yard back to normal.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.503
Now, you listen to me.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.754
Whoever T.P.'d your house

07:42.880 --> 07:44.465
is still out there
roaming the streets.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.467
It's only a matter of time
before another house

07:46.592 --> 07:48.469
and another family
is victimized!

07:48.594 --> 07:50.929
I have to stop that
from happening.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.724
You really have nothing better
to do, do you?

07:53.849 --> 07:56.435
No, I do not.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.229
No.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.524
No. No.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.443
Aah.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.945
Oh, Jesus, no. Our house.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.281
Mommy! Mommy!
- Mommy! Mommy!

08:09.406 --> 08:14.036
Why? Why? Why?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.707
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.627
I have to tell the truth.
Mom!

08:23.795 --> 08:26.381
Hello, Kyle.
Going somewhere?

08:27.799 --> 08:30.594
I was -- I was just going
to get a drink of water.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.222
No need.
I have one for you right here.

08:34.223 --> 08:37.017
Oh. Okay.
Thanks.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.894
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.438
No. I'll just be going
back to bed now.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.066
You do that.
Good night, Kyle.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.864
Josh Meyers T.P.'d over
600 houses in less than a year.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.115
He's a real monster.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.951
I just need to talk to someone

08:54.076 --> 08:56.495
who knows
how toilet-paperers think.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.621
Just remember --

08:57.746 --> 09:01.291
He'd toilet-paper you in
a second if he had the chance.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.169
He's the last cell on your left.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.891
Hello, Josh.
My name is Officer Barbrady.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.810
I'm with the South Park police.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.062
That's a
terrible cologne you're wearing, Officer.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.565
You should try something
more...casual.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.110
I was hoping you could help me
solve a toilet-papering case.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.278
And why would I do that?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.446
Because I'm such a charming
fella?

09:31.572 --> 09:34.908
Uh, please. I need your help.
What would you want in return?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.911
Due to the harsh nature
of my crimes,

09:38.036 --> 09:40.414
they don't allow me to have
toilet paper in my cell.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.583
You can imagine how bothersome
that becomes.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.419
You know I can't give you
toilet paper, Josh.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.422
No, but it was worth a try,
wasn't it?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.756
Tell me something, Officer --

09:49.881 --> 09:51.550
Why is it that you police
such a small town?

09:51.675 --> 09:52.968
You must have had
larger inspirations.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.596
What happened
to those big-city dreams?

09:55.721 --> 09:57.472
Well, that's kind of personal.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.932
Quid pro quo, Officer.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.559
Tell me what I want to know,

10:00.684 --> 10:04.438
and I'll help you catch whoever
toilet-papered that house.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.693
Look, kid,
I have very little time

10:09.818 --> 10:11.987
to catch whoever toilet-papered
that house.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.363
Tell me what you know.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.990
Are those the crime-scene
photos?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.116
Let me see them.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.372
Yes.
Yes.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.333
Not bad work.
Not bad at all.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.959
These toilet-paperers
are professionals --

10:26.084 --> 10:27.252
at least one of them is.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.504
So you think there was more
than one. Why?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.839
Tell me something first.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.258
When you went to the academy, you had
something to prove, you wanted

10:33.383 --> 10:35.135
to protect and serve, but mostly you just wanted
to protect yourself.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.846
Who were you protecting yourself
from, Officer Barbrady?

10:37.971 --> 10:38.680
All right!
All right!

10:38.805 --> 10:40.641
My Uncle Charles used to hit me
with a belt!

10:42.351 --> 10:43.268
Thank you.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.187
Your toilet-paperers
are most like males

10:45.312 --> 10:47.230
between the ages of 8 and 10
and probably virgins.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.774
Parents notice
that much toilet paper missing,

10:48.899 --> 10:50.233
so they would've bought it
themselves.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.902
Find out where the toilet paper
came from,

10:52.027 --> 10:53.570
and you just might catch
your man.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.909
Stan, Kenny, can I talk
to you guys for a second?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.952
I think we have the counselor
and principal fooled,

11:01.078 --> 11:02.663
but we need to talk about Kyle.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.414
- What about him?
- Come on. You know.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.791
He's losing it.
He's gonna crack.

11:05.916 --> 11:06.792
Mrph rmhmhm rm.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.877
Kyle can't take the heat.
He's gonna sing like a canary.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.587
Then we're all gonna take
the fall for what we did.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.172
Hey, fellas!

11:12.297 --> 11:13.590
Butters.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.476
Look, all it takes
is for one of us to crack,

11:24.601 --> 11:26.144
and we all know
who the weakest link is.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.145
So what should we do?

11:27.270 --> 11:30.148
We have no choice.
We have to kill Kyle.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.526
Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
- Mrph!

11:32.651 --> 11:35.070
Why not?
- Kyle's not gonna say anything.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.905
He almost spilled the beans
in the counselor's office.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.281
He can't even keep
the story straight.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.783
I'm telling you guys, he's weak.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.119
He's weak, and he'll be
the end of all of us.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.081
You wanted to see me,
Officer Barbrady?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.708
Yes.
Thanks for coming, Mr. Bell.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.292
A house was T.P.'d
in South Park,

11:49.418 --> 11:51.753
and I need to see if you can
identify the toilet paper

11:51.878 --> 11:53.213
I recovered from the scene.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.091
I'm sorry I have to do this.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.428
Oh, my God.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.055
Is this toilet paper
from your store?

12:02.180 --> 12:05.100
It's...difficult to tell.
It's so decayed.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.435
I...wait a minute.
Yes.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.645
Yes, I recognize
the floral pattern now.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.313
Positive I.D.
on the toilet paper.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.399
Who would do this
to toilet paper? Who?

12:12.524 --> 12:14.526
Mr. Bell, do you remember
anyone suspicious

12:14.651 --> 12:16.570
buying toilet paper
in the last few days?

12:16.695 --> 12:17.821
Suspicious like how?

12:17.946 --> 12:21.450
Well, like someone who was black
or Mexican or Middle-Eastern.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.536
No, the only Mexican guy I recall
bought toaster tarts and chips.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.581
And we don't allow Middle-
Eastern people in the store.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.332
Oh my God.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.712
What's this all about, Cartman?

12:33.837 --> 12:35.672
I just wanted to see
how you're doing, Kyle.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.174
Why don't we go out
for a little boat ride?

12:37.299 --> 12:38.008
A boat ride?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.177
I just thought we should find
a private place to talk.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.511
Well, okay.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.181
Could you help me put this block
and chain in the boat?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.481
Okay.
Let's go.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.491
So, how are things, Kyle?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.533
Terrible.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.911
Every time I close my eyes,
I see the house we T.P.'d.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.370
I see the tears
of our art teacher

13:07.496 --> 13:09.122
and hear the screams
of her daughters.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.666
And you feel like
you have to confess.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.876
I don't know what to do.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.212
Part of me feels
like I have to end it all now,

13:15.337 --> 13:17.464
tell people what happened.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.717
You know, I never noticed how
beautiful this pond was before.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.010
So calm.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.720
The world can be like that --

13:23.845 --> 13:28.016
so calm on the outside,
as if nothing bad ever happens.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.227
Ow.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.978
What the hell are you doing,
Cartman?

13:32.103 --> 13:32.979
I'm killing you,

13:33.104 --> 13:34.481
but unfortunately I could only
afford a Wiffle bat,

13:34.606 --> 13:35.482
so it's gonna take a while.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.817
Cartman!

13:36.942 --> 13:38.318
Don't fight it, Kyle.
It will only take longer.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.903
Just slip
into sweet unconsciousness.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.739
You want to kill me?
Fine!

13:42.864 --> 13:45.408
I can't live like this anymore!
Go ahead!

13:45.534 --> 13:46.868
Do it.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.795
Won't be long now, Kyle.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.092
Josh, I need more help.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.719
The answer is right in front
of you, but you can't see it.

14:04.845 --> 14:05.887
How do you mean?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.765
Tell me. The toilet paper --
Was it quilted?

14:08.890 --> 14:09.683
Yes.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.435
Single-sheet?
- No, two-ply.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.479
What?
What does that tell you?

14:15.146 --> 14:18.149
Why does one toilet-paper
a house, Officer?

14:18.275 --> 14:19.985
To get revenge.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.820
No. That is incidental.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.573
Your toilet-paperers wanted to
transform the teacher's house,

14:24.698 --> 14:26.700
thus transforming
her entire occupation.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.826
What do you mean?

14:27.951 --> 14:30.245
Your uncle who hit you with
a belt -- Was he a large man?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.955
I don't have time for this, kid.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.874
Did he stink like beer
when he came home from work

14:33.999 --> 14:36.167
all tired from playing
down at the pool house?

14:36.293 --> 14:36.918
All right!
All right!

14:37.043 --> 14:39.170
My dad dressed me up like
a little girl on poker nights

14:39.296 --> 14:41.464
and made me sit
on all my uncles' laps!

14:44.926 --> 14:45.802
Whoa.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.721
Uh, oh--thank you.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.639
Your toilet-paperers
are most likely students

14:49.764 --> 14:50.682
in the art teacher's class,

14:50.807 --> 14:52.183
students who aren't
very good at art.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.978
Oh. Of course.
One of her students!

14:55.103 --> 14:57.606
Fly along now, Officer Barbrady.
You've got some arrests to make.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.357
Fly, fly, fly.
Fly, fly, fly.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.488
Josh, were you doing the silly
voice for the policeman again?

15:05.614 --> 15:06.573
No, sir.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.833
Cartman, what are you doing?
- I'm getting rid of our problem.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.627
Kyle will be dead
in a matter of hours.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.504
You don't have
to kill Kyle, dude.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.840
The police made an arrest,
and the person confessed!

15:23.965 --> 15:25.425
They did?
- They did?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.802
They say they got the guy that
did it at the police station.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.096
Who confessed?
That doesn't make any sense.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.349
But can I still kill Kyle?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.897
Hello, boys.
How are you?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.315
We heard that you have
the person

15:40.440 --> 15:41.566
who T.P.'d
the art teacher's house.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.693
Is that true?
- It sure is.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.446
Uh, could we see them --
him -- her?

15:46.571 --> 15:47.948
Right over here.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.784
Yeah, we interrogated
the suspect for over 40 hours,

15:50.909 --> 15:52.661
and he finally cracked.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.162
Hey, fellas!

15:54.287 --> 15:55.246
Butters?

15:55.372 --> 15:57.332
Yep.
I'm in jail.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.667
You confessed?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.294
Uh-huh. Uh, they said I T.P.'d
the art teacher's house.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.005
I don't seem to remember it, but
they're pretty sure it was me.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.383
I just can't get my behavior
under control.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.593
His parents are
on their way down now.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.096
Yeah. And, boy,
are they gonna let me have it.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.098
Just wait till my father
gets here.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.266
You guys,
we can't let him do this.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.352
What are you talking about?
This is a gift from God.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.853
An early Easter present
all wrapped up

16:18.979 --> 16:21.147
with a pretty ribbon
from Jesus Christ himself.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.983
I'm just a little asshole
is what I am.

16:23.108 --> 16:23.942
When God made me,

16:24.067 --> 16:25.694
He must have not been paying
very close attention,

16:25.819 --> 16:28.196
'cause I turned out wrong --
just plain wrong.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.365
Officer Barbrady,
Butters didn't T.P. that house.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.366
Why do you say that?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.326
Because it was --
- Wiffle ball, anyone?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.537
Anyone care for a nice game
of Wiffle ball?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.664
You know, it's not my parents
I'm worried about.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.082
It's my girlfriend, Carrie.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.208
Well, she lives in Michigan.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.584
But when she finds out
about this,

16:41.710 --> 16:43.670
whoo, smokies,
is she gonna be sore.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.213
She might even break up with me.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.756
And it would serve me right,
too.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.633
All right, boys.
Visiting time is over.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.176
Thanks for stopping by.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.306
You see, you guys?
It all worked itself out.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.767
Ta-dow. Ta-dow.
How do you like me now?

16:57.892 --> 16:59.394
Feel a little silly now, Kyle?

16:59.519 --> 17:00.979
Ta-dow.
How do you like me now?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.564
I still feel bad, Cartman.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.191
What?
How -- How can you feel bad?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.985
Somebody else is gonna pay
for our crime.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.571
Yeah.
That makes it even worse.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.114
Buh...

17:11.948 --> 17:14.200
Uh, K-Kyle, you don't seem
to understand.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.453
W-We're not gonna get punished
for this, ever.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.038
I know.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.624
S--
So then how can you feel bad?

17:21.750 --> 17:23.001
He feels guilty for doing it

17:23.126 --> 17:25.670
and for letting someone else pay
for it.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.213
But he's not gonna get
in trouble.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.840
It doesn't matter
if you get in trouble or not.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.050
You can still feel bad.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.093
I think you're right, Kyle.
Maybe we should confess.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.219
Mrph.
Rm mrprhm.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.680
What?
D-- You guys.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.348
There's nothing
to feel bad about.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.600
We're off scot-free!

17:38.725 --> 17:41.144
We feel bad for other people.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.856
For o-- For --

17:44.981 --> 17:46.691
Ow.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.653
I-Is it that you think
you might get in trouble <i>later?</i>

17:50.779 --> 17:52.781
Tomorrow in school, we'll tell
the art teacher it was us

17:52.906 --> 17:53.907
and let her decide what to do.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.867
And, Cartman, if you have any
thread of a conscience at all,

17:55.992 --> 17:56.868
you'll do the same.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.207
Freakin' weirdos, man.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.210
Well, well, well.
I had to see it to believe it.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.377
Hi, Dad.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.254
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me.

18:08.379 --> 18:12.050
Look at you, standing
behind prison bars -- again!

18:12.175 --> 18:12.967
Yeah.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.928
What fibs have you been telling
this policeman, Butters?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.597
You know damn well you didn't
toilet-paper that house.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.264
Huh?

18:18.389 --> 18:20.266
Butters was with us all night,
Officer Barbrady.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.518
Butters, what have we told you

18:21.643 --> 18:23.436
about confessing to crimes
you didn't commit?

18:23.561 --> 18:24.479
We have had it, mister!

18:24.604 --> 18:26.272
Well, they kept accusing me
for hours,

18:26.397 --> 18:28.441
and then he shot me up
with sodium pentothal.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.984
And that's your excuse?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.569
Well, looks like
I made a mistake.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.530
I guess I better let you out
now.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.199
Just wait till we get you home,
you little fibber!

18:36.324 --> 18:38.785
Officer, can I stay in jail,
please?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.538
Come on, you guys!
Hurry!

18:41.663 --> 18:42.705
What is it, Cartman?

18:42.831 --> 18:45.083
It's over this way.
Come on!

18:51.422 --> 18:53.466
So, how are things, guys?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.802
Cartman, we're confessing
tomorrow, and that's final.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.595
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.264
You can't kill all three of us,
Cartman.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.557
Can't I?

19:07.564 --> 19:08.857
Excuse me, everyone.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.401
I have someone with me
who can tell us all

19:11.526 --> 19:13.611
who toilet-papered
the art teacher's house!

19:15.363 --> 19:16.948
Josh insisted he be able

19:17.073 --> 19:19.701
to tell you the names of
the toilet-paperers in person.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.452
Uh, that's nice,
Officer Barbrady,

19:21.578 --> 19:23.955
but we actually don't need --
- Hold it!

19:24.080 --> 19:26.291
Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey,
Mrs. Dreible,

19:26.416 --> 19:28.293
we have something we need
to tell you.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.045
All right. Will you people stop
barging into my office, please?

19:31.171 --> 19:32.255
What's the matter,
Principal Victoria?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.256
Was your mother abusive?

19:33.381 --> 19:34.716
Did she spank your thighs
with cold cuts

19:34.841 --> 19:36.426
and stick umbrellas up your ass?

19:36.551 --> 19:37.635
Get him out of here.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.346
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you
take Josh outside, please?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.557
Ooh. Policeman Brown.
Never quite made officer.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.100
Why is that, Policeman Brown?

19:44.225 --> 19:46.019
We have to confess
that we were the ones that --

19:46.144 --> 19:47.562
It's too late, boys, m'kay?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.355
We already know everything.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.983
You -- You do?
How?

19:53.776 --> 19:54.861
Hi, guys.

19:54.986 --> 19:55.820
Cartman?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.739
I told them everything, guys.
It's over.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.908
Luckily for us, one of you
had enough of a conscience

20:00.033 --> 20:00.909
to come forward.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.785
My consciousness
just caught up with me.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.786
That's not fair!

20:03.912 --> 20:05.622
You all get two weeks
of detention,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.082
except for Eric, who gets
one week for being brave.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.627
B-But he's lying!
He doesn't have a conscience!

20:10.752 --> 20:12.670
Well, I guess my work here
is done.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.174
After all this,
I'm gonna need a long vacation.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.926
This was supposed to be
<i>my</i> story,

20:18.051 --> 20:19.928
<i>my</i> coming to terms
with a guilty conscience.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.512
This isn't fair!

20:21.638 --> 20:23.514
Okay, Josh.
Time to go back to the --

20:23.640 --> 20:25.433
Oh, no!

20:25.558 --> 20:28.353
H-He was too fast for me.
He ran out the door!

20:28.478 --> 20:30.939
Well, couldn't you have gone
after him?

20:31.064 --> 20:33.149
Well, I-I'm covered in toilet
paper.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.943
I'd look silly.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.404
Welcome to detention.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.323
You will be here until 5:00,

20:40.448 --> 20:43.576
so make good study use
of your time, m'kay?

20:43.701 --> 20:44.786
Oof.
Two weeks of this.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.121
Yeah. But I have to say
I feel a lot better now.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.289
I know what you mean, Kyle.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.500
I realize now that even though
you might not get caught

20:50.625 --> 20:52.710
doing something bad,
you can still get caught later.

20:52.835 --> 20:53.544
Oh, Jesus.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.922
I didn't feel bad before,
but now I just feel terrible.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.299
You just feel bad for yourself
that you're in detention.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.133
Right.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.718
I guess I learned today
that sometimes you --

21:00.843 --> 21:02.345
Oh, stop it, Cartman.
You didn't learn anything.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.847
Not a goddamn thing.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.266
Hmm.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.312
Police station.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.981
Hello, Officer Barbrady.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.358
Josh?
Josh, where are you?

21:15.483 --> 21:16.985
I'm afraid that giving away
my location

21:17.110 --> 21:18.653
might be harmful to my freedom,
Officer.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.696
I just wanted to thank you

21:19.821 --> 21:21.364
for helping me get out
of that dingy cell.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.408
Josh, you have to go back
to juvenile hall.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.159
You only have
a three-week sentence.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.286
Sorry, Officer.
Got to run.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.704
There's something
I've been meaning to do

21:27.829 --> 21:28.705
for quite some time.

21:28.830 --> 21:29.539
Ciao.
