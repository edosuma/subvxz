WEBVTT

00:04.604 --> 00:07.129
Yo, this is a lot bigger
than what we budgeted for.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.538
We're gonna need a
lot more fertilizer.

00:08.608 --> 00:10.701
You know, our plan is to
talk to a few investors.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.404
You about to get pounds of weed.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.208
I mean elbows, girl.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.474
And on top of that,
we doin' somethin'

00:15.548 --> 00:16.640
good for the community.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.206
Man, I don't care
about no community.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.512
But I do need product.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.416
Hey, baby.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.511
Hi, Dianne!

00:21.588 --> 00:23.317
I thought we talked
about getting high

00:23.390 --> 00:25.221
and hanging out
with homeless dudes.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.156
I don't want you hanging
out with these bums.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.956
I think she finally
tired of my ass, man.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.428
Don't even let it happen, Dawg.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.465
She fine and mmm!

00:32.531 --> 00:33.897
And that's about as good
as you're gonna do, dawg.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.662
You lucky I ain't a snitch, man.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.293
'Cause I'd have been
had the cops come

00:37.370 --> 00:38.735
and haul your ass off.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.670
Matter of fact, next time
I catch you at my complex,

00:40.740 --> 00:42.503
it's gonna be
"Punch in the face" time.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.509
I think he's a danger
to the community,

00:44.577 --> 00:46.169
and I want you to
keep an eye on him.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.942
Follow him around, keep me
posted on what's happening.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.006
Deal?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.517
Go take a shower, man.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.745
You want me clean,
that gonna be extra.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.583
Yeah, I checked the tracking number.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.147
That's why I'm calling
you right now.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.089
Figure it out.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.149
Okay, it's all good.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.819
Farm nigga.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.090
Up kind of early this morning.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.097
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:06.166 --> 01:08.066
Just Vic talking
out his ass again.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.692
Yeah, I heard your
cult leader got y'all out

01:09.769 --> 01:11.066
there working hard.

01:11.137 --> 01:14.004
Doing farm work, looking
like a bunch of assholes.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.371
It's a community garden, nigga.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.069
We trying to teach motherfuckers
how to eat right.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18.611 --> 01:22.604
And you niggas gonna save the
whole community with turnips.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.884
Look, nigga, I'm missing
a very important package.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.113
I ain't seen your package, Vic.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.519
You ain't maybe, like,
see the package

01:29.589 --> 01:31.955
and look in there and notice
that it was some expensive

01:32.025 --> 01:35.188
Joseph Canali Italian Loafers
inside that package?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.250
Loafers?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.762
Nigga, is you serious?

01:37.831 --> 01:40.527
Hey, Boonie, he mad 'cause
he lost his slippers, man.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.726
Loafers, nigga, not slippers!

01:42.802 --> 01:43.962
<i>Do they have laces?</i>

01:44.037 --> 01:45.766
<i>If they don't have laces,
they slippers.</i>

01:45.839 --> 01:49.036
Ain't nobody asked your fat,
rolly-polly ass.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.736
Hey, whatever you want
to call them, Vic,

01:50.810 --> 01:51.742
they ain't in my crib.

01:51.811 --> 01:52.903
Hey, you know what?

01:52.979 --> 01:53.911
Uh, then why don't
you let me come in

01:53.980 --> 01:55.106
and look around the apartment?

01:55.181 --> 01:56.808
I ain't got your
slippers, man! A'ight?

01:56.883 --> 01:59.408
Well, then...
Hey, nigga, what you doin'

01:59.486 --> 02:00.578

me like that, man?!

02:00.653 --> 02:02.518
Big dusty-ass nigga.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.386
Scared you a
little bit, huh, Vic?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.583
He was scared.

02:05.658 --> 02:06.488
He shook.

02:06.559 --> 02:07.787
Hey, looky here, man,

02:07.861 --> 02:09.761
uh, I'm missing an
expensive package.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.091
It's a very important package.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.290
You wouldn't happen
to have seen it, would you?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.265
Oh!

02:14.334 --> 02:15.892
About this big?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.960
- About this wide?
- Yeah.

02:18.037 --> 02:21.404
You talking about those butter
soft Joseph Canali slippers?

02:21.474 --> 02:22.304
That's right.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.205
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:23.276 --> 02:24.766
Whoo!

02:24.844 --> 02:26.709
Hey, them mugs is hard, Vic!

02:26.779 --> 02:28.940
Man, you already a sharp
dresser, but with them,

02:29.015 --> 02:32.314
you gonna be on the top of the
extra-crispy nigga list, man!

02:32.385 --> 02:34.148
Now check it out, man...

02:34.220 --> 02:35.551
I knew you...
I knew you would know, man.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.021
Where they at?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.820
No, I ain't seen 'em.
I'm just sayin', though,

02:39.893 --> 02:41.087
they probably got lost
or something, man.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.423
And to be honest with you, man,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.019
God don't want you to
have them shoes, Dawg,

02:44.097 --> 02:45.428
'cause you too
thirsty for them, man.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.965
You want them too bad, man.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.593
And you do know vanity one of
the seven deadly sins, right?

02:49.669 --> 02:52.866
I'm giving you one more
chance to return my sli...

02:52.939 --> 02:54.736
I mean my...
my loafers, nigga!

02:54.807 --> 02:56.001
Swear to Pops, homey...

02:56.075 --> 02:57.372
I ain't knowing.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.844
He's upset.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.347
Hey, shoes don't
make the man, Vic.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:17.096 --> 03:19.189
Hey, man, spit it out, man.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.529
The soil's no good, man.
We can't plant there.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.762
I told you, Dawg...
Wrong spot.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.861
All that damn work for nothing.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.804
Yeah, well, the soil would've
been good if we didn't

03:27.874 --> 03:30.138
give the Cholos
our fertilizer money.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.178
And we need that
fertilizer, too...

03:32.245 --> 03:33.872
A lot of it.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.380
I mean, that's what Pop said.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.813
And the fresher, the better.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.011
It got to be fresh, coming
from some happy horses, 'cause,

03:40.086 --> 03:42.281
you know, stress translates
through the shit, man,

03:42.355 --> 03:44.016
and it'll fuck up
the quality of the weed.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.853
We got a big-ass area
to cover, y'all,

03:45.925 --> 03:47.859
so we gonna need at
least a truckload of it.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.020
6 miles away, we have the
Compton boarding stables.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.654
They have cow and horse manure.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.722
Wow.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.701
They're actually selling
at $800 a ton.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.532
$800 for some shit?!

03:58.605 --> 04:00.334
Nah, that's crazy, man!

04:00.406 --> 04:02.340
How they gonna charge?
Where the free stuff at, man?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.841
No, everything's about the same.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.243
I mean, nothing in L.A.
Is free, not even dung.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.543
Man, I don't even
have $800 to my name.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.083
You know what that means?

04:11.150 --> 04:14.017
That means I'm literally
not worth a sack of shit.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.180
Just don't seem right to me,
though, y'all.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.814
I mean, that's horse shit.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.414
It's part of the ecosystem.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.016
The circle of life.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.324
No, you can't have a
monopoly on horse waste.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.556
Whoa, wait.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.758
But if that's the case and all
we need is shit,

04:26.833 --> 04:29.563
who's to say we can't just sneak
in the stalls about 3:00

04:29.636 --> 04:32.104
in the morning, do a little
shovel, shovel, and bounce?

04:32.171 --> 04:33.661
I mean, we just cleaning
out the stalls, right?

04:33.740 --> 04:34.672
Yeah.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.140
I ain't even mad at that, Fish.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.403
Are you serious?

04:37.477 --> 04:38.501
You gonna do the job with us?

04:38.578 --> 04:39.909
Carefully, though.
Carefully.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.571
We don't want
nobody to get hurt.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.138
Man, who gonna get
hurt stealing shit?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.740
I mean, the shit
ain't gonna fight back.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.580
He's right.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.881
Technically,
it won't fight back.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.945
Tray, I don't need your
technicalities right now.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.547
We need horse manure.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.626
Hey, baby.

04:57.697 --> 04:58.595
Hey!

04:58.665 --> 05:00.462
Mmm, damn, Jason.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.023
You clean up nice, baby.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.261
Mmm, thank you, baby,

05:03.336 --> 05:04.826
but I look like somebody
that park cars.

05:04.904 --> 05:05.996
Aww!

05:06.072 --> 05:07.198
Bitches don't think that's sexy.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.535
Well, I don't know
about bitches,

05:08.608 --> 05:10.803
but this woman thinks
employment is sexy.

05:10.877 --> 05:11.741
Okay?

05:11.811 --> 05:12.641
Mm-hmm.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.643
Oh, wait, hold on.
Let me turn that off.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.512
Hey, I just want to say that
I'm really proud of you

05:17.583 --> 05:19.016
for agreeing to take the job.

05:19.085 --> 05:23.454
And since somebody's
been such a good boy...

05:23.523 --> 05:24.854
Bam!

05:24.924 --> 05:25.913
Open it.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.287
- Retro J's?
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.193
Baby, you didn't.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.561
- I did.
- Oh, my God.

05:32.632 --> 05:33.860
I don't even know what to say.

05:33.933 --> 05:34.991
Oh, you can thank me
later, Papi.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.262
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.234
Baby, I love 'em.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.292
Yeah?

05:38.371 --> 05:39.599
Oh, you know what I'm gonna do?

05:39.672 --> 05:41.640
I'm gonna get me a
special case made for them.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.767
You know, one with the
plexiglas on both sides,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.367
with the mirror in the
back so when you walk past,

05:45.445 --> 05:47.003
you can see both sides
at the same time.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.777
No, baby, they're meant
to be worn, like tonight.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.080
Wait. We <i>are</i> still
going out tonight, right?

05:53.152 --> 05:54.949
Oh, yeah, baby,
for sure we going out to...

05:55.021 --> 05:56.488
Look, I'm gonna
wear them tonight.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.955
You know what they say, right?

05:58.024 --> 05:58.854
What?

05:58.925 --> 06:00.085
Shoes make the man.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.923
Mmm. Exactly.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.792
That's my baby.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.093
So you're sure nothing
about my package?

06:08.167 --> 06:10.431
Nope. They all be
talking about that garden.

06:10.503 --> 06:11.834
And something about some shit.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.804
- Shit?
- Yeah.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.103
Yo, I still think it was either
the convict or the con man.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.301
Oh, yeah.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.242
They probably saw the
package lying around.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.404
I know I would've taken it.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.311
Well, this package
contained a pair

06:22.382 --> 06:23.542
of very fashionable loafers.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.379
Mm. Like house shoes?

06:25.451 --> 06:27.180
No, not like house shoes.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.845
Like loafers.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.821
There's a big difference, okay?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.450
Look, you know what?

06:33.526 --> 06:36.825
What I'm gonna need you to do is
I'm gonna need you to go over

06:36.896 --> 06:40.263
to Fish's house, look around,
and find my shoes.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.300
Hmm.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.834
You mean like breaking in?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.632
No, you ain't got to break in.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.797
I got the key.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.898
Well, why don't you
go do it yourself?

06:48.975 --> 06:51.205
'Cause I got you. See?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.745
You go over there, you look
around, you find my shoes,

06:53.813 --> 06:55.405
you bring them back.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.675
Think about it, man...

06:56.749 --> 06:58.910
this dude, Fish, works
long hours at their farm,

06:58.985 --> 07:00.077
usually at night.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.815
Gives you plenty of time
to get in and get out.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.220
Sounds dangerous.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.222
What do I get?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.452
Macaroni and cheese, nigga.

07:07.527 --> 07:08.494
This is different.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.553
This is breaking and entering.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.395
I go get them shoes, I want
three nights in the bed.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.025
You sleep on the couch.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.538
Like I said, we get this call
from a bunch of people talking

07:19.605 --> 07:22.438
about how there's this crazy guy
at the park running around,

07:22.508 --> 07:23.998
you know, screaming,
just being a lunatic.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.236
Mm-hmm.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.472
And so when we finally get
there, baby, get this...

07:27.547 --> 07:29.310
He's naked.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.747
So, we finally get him in
handcuffs,

07:30.817 --> 07:33.149
and then he's going on and
on about how powerful his

07:33.219 --> 07:34.914
attorney is, blah, blah,
blah, and I'm like,

07:34.987 --> 07:36.147
"Look, you're naked.
I don't care.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.849
I just want to see
what's in your trunk."

07:37.924 --> 07:38.856
Right.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.483
So, we finally get to his car,

07:40.560 --> 07:41.549
and then I get in his trunk,

07:41.627 --> 07:42.889
and there's this big metal...

07:42.962 --> 07:45.897
and I just...

07:45.965 --> 07:47.626
What is it, baby?

07:47.700 --> 07:50.533
I think I just saw
Luther Vandross.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.002
Oh, you know what?

07:52.071 --> 07:54.869
I just remember he dead, so that
probably wasn't even him, baby.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.203
Anyway, what was you saying?

07:56.275 --> 07:58.038
Um, what was I saying?

07:58.110 --> 07:59.042
The naked dude.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.601
Oh, the naked guy, right.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.911
So, the naked guy takes us to
his car, and I go to his trunk,

08:03.983 --> 08:06.508
and I open it, and there's,
like, this big metal...

08:06.586 --> 08:08.213
Uh, excuse me, baby.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.585
Um...

08:10.656 --> 08:12.624
I got to go to the
bathroom real quick.

08:12.692 --> 08:13.886
Just got to pee.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.723
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.160
Okay.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.562
I'll... I'll tell you
the story when you get back.

08:19.632 --> 08:20.963
I'll be right back.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.139
Hey, Jay, we need to
holler at you, Dawg.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.106
We got to go pull off
this heist tonight.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.107
A what?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.336
This heist, man.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.174
We got to go acquire
some horse manure, man.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.215
We need it for the garden.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.010
Wait. And we got
to leave right now?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.211
Well, I see what you doing...
Got them exclusives on.

08:40.285 --> 08:41.150
Boy, you fucking a rung, nigga!

08:42.655 --> 08:45.317
Yeah, look, whatever it is, man,
I can't do it tonight.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.358
You got some new J's.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.585
So, what, you better
than the crew?

08:47.660 --> 08:48.922
No, it ain't that.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.361
Look, I'm having dinner with
my <i>detective</i> girlfriend.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.193
I don't think it's in nobody
best interest for us to

08:53.266 --> 08:54.460
go steal some shit.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.592
Man, come on, Jay.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.532
We need you, Dawg.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.092

08:58.170 --> 08:59.296
We gonna have you right back.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.669
She ain't even gonna
notice you missing.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.002
We having dinner.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.008
How she not gonna know I'm
missing for 45 minutes?

09:04.076 --> 09:06.135
Brah, God needs you
to do this, man.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.543
Real talk.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.080
Why me?

09:09.148 --> 09:12.015
'Cause, man, we using Ms. Tudi's
landscaper's truck, man.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.449
You know that
motherfucker's a stick,

09:13.519 --> 09:16.010
and you the only one in the crew
that know how to drive a stick.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.680
We got it all figured out, man.

09:17.757 --> 09:21.420
Listen, unless you and Pops can
come up with some crazy miracle

09:21.494 --> 09:25.521
to make Dianne disappear,
I can't help you.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.690
Come on, Jay.

09:26.766 --> 09:27.698
Jay! Jay!

09:27.767 --> 09:28.995
Jason!

09:29.068 --> 09:31.059
Jay! Jay!

09:34.540 --> 09:36.167
Yeah... okay.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.675
No, no, no, it's... it's okay.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.005
I understand.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.204
I'll be there.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.712
All right, bye.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.715
Baby, I'm sorry.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.114
You're never gonna believe this.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.549
I just got called in to work.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.484
And it's...
it's really important.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.612
I just have to go.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.656
I'll see you at home.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.690
Okay.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.724
Eat your food.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.783
Okay.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.417
Mmm.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.052
A palace.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.289
Hoo.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.431
Brewsky.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.525
Everybody need a little taste.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.796
Okay.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.364
Mm-hmm.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.407
Mmm.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.203
Real.

11:17.276 --> 11:18.607
Give me a double hitter.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.077
Mmm.

11:20.146 --> 11:24.139
Mm-hmm.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.410
Ahh!

11:25.484 --> 11:26.416
Mm-hmm.

11:26.485 --> 11:29.545
Yes, it is.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.352
Mm.

11:32.425 --> 11:37.488
That's damn good.

11:42.234 --> 11:43.360
Oh, this is so fresh, man!

11:43.436 --> 11:44.403
Come here...
Smell it!

11:44.470 --> 11:45.402
This is rich!

11:45.471 --> 11:47.098
We're not here to be smelling.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.368
Just hurry up and shovel so
we can get up out of here.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.740
And, fool, come on
with the work lights, man.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.108
Hey, hold up, man.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.203
I had it plugged in backwards.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.713
Man, hurry the fuck up, Boonie.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.113
Dude, I told you already, man,
the connectors are marked.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.879
I got it hooked up.
Check it out. Bam!

11:59.952 --> 12:01.351
Ohh!

12:01.420 --> 12:04.617
Shh! Be quiet, man. Come on.
Let's get this stuff loaded up.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.319
Hey, what the fuck
you doing, man?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.382
Get your ass out here and help.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.894
Nope, I drive.
That's the deal.

12:09.962 --> 12:10.792
I ain't getting out.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.296
Because of those shoes?

12:12.364 --> 12:13.456
Come on, man.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.897
We need all hands
on deck. Let's go!

12:14.967 --> 12:16.958
Nope, I'm not getting out.
Fuck out of here.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.560
Come on, Boonie, man, stop
playing with them lights

12:18.637 --> 12:20.571
and grab a shovel.

12:20.639 --> 12:21.901
Fuck.

12:21.974 --> 12:23.703
Hold on! I'm on fire!

12:23.776 --> 12:24.868
My goddamn legs!

12:24.944 --> 12:25.911
Ohh!

12:25.978 --> 12:27.502
Somebody get the hose, man!

12:27.580 --> 12:29.480
Oh, my God!

12:29.548 --> 12:31.140
Oh, my God! Jesus!

12:31.217 --> 12:32.149
Got it! Move, move!

12:32.218 --> 12:33.651
Fire!

12:33.719 --> 12:36.688
Jason, move I got him!

12:36.756 --> 12:38.781
You okay?

12:38.858 --> 12:40.348
Damn, Boonie.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.451
Good job, Jay.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.155
You all right, man?

12:44.230 --> 12:47.256
Man...

12:49.902 --> 12:50.926
That was scary.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.265
Listen, we're way behind schedule.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.635
We got to go.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.436
Jason, you got horse dookie
on your new J's, man.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.216
Genie!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.378
Mmm!

13:12.391 --> 13:13.722
Giddyup.
Yeah.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.055
Giddyup.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.630
Uh-oh.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.382
Go get the gate.
Get the gate.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.628
We're behind schedule.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.664
Let's go.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.085
Go, brother.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.620
Shoot that ball!
Go ahead, playah!

14:18.190 --> 14:20.055
Mm-hmm.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.525
Damn.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.461
That damn O'Reilly.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.089
Fuck you.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.157
Kiss my black ass.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.834
Hey, can we just spread
this out later, man?

14:33.906 --> 14:36.602
I mean, ain't nobody gonna be
looking for a big pile of shit.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.336
Yeah, I guess so.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.401
Hey, Jay.

14:43.916 --> 14:44.848
I'm sorry, man.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.578
I did the best I could.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.086
Sorry, man.

14:49.154 --> 14:52.419
Man, you have no idea how much
I'm screwed right now, man.

14:52.491 --> 14:53.856
Dianne just got me these shoes.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.554
Man, stop crying like a little
girl over some damn shoes.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.153
Your ass starting
to sound like Vic.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.527
Hey, man, tell her
you got jacked.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.122
Do not tell her that.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.667
I wouldn't mess with a guy
who got jacked for his J's

15:02.735 --> 15:04.430
the first day he wore them.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.767
Man, it's either be
a punk or a shit thief.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.500
It's up to you, man.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.871
I'm out of here, man.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.503
Wait a minute, Jay.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.773
I appreciate your help, Bro.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.815
Man, can God fix my shoes?

15:16.882 --> 15:19.510
Jay, you know how God
feel about vanity, man.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.746
$300 for a pair of shoes?

15:21.820 --> 15:22.787
Are you serious?

15:22.855 --> 15:25.517
You know I love you, though, boy.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.751
Hey, hey, hey.

15:26.825 --> 15:28.417
His girl a detective.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.621
He spent intimate
time with a Dick.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.229
He like dick.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.326
He like dick.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.533
Dick lover!

15:39.605 --> 15:42.199
Dang, boy, we ain't got no
smoke, we ain't got no weed.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.673
I got a lot of food, though.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.108
I'm telling you, I got
everything from pizza pockets

15:46.178 --> 15:49.170
to potato salad and
everything in betwe...

15:49.248 --> 15:50.545
Man, why the hell
is my door open?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.516
Did you forget to lock it?

15:52.584 --> 15:54.575
Hell, nah.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.340
Are you serious?

16:17.409 --> 16:18.467
Chill out, Fish.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.476
Relax, man.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.740
This nigga broke
in my fucking house!

16:21.814 --> 16:23.873
Well, right now is not
the time for anger, man.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.610
It's the time for
forgiveness, man.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.675
He's sick.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.550
Lloyd! Hey!

16:29.621 --> 16:31.521
Don't kick him.
Don't kick him.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.751
Hey, wake your ass up, man!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.953
I just bought
that peanut butter!

16:36.028 --> 16:38.428
Hey, man, check him, make
sure he ain't stole nothing.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.362
Fish, man, dude
in his drawers, man.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.491
He ain't got nowhere
to hide nothing, brah.

16:42.568 --> 16:43.432
Lloyd.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.833
Wake up, Lloyd.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.837
This...

16:46.905 --> 16:48.839
this nigga ate a whole
fucking box of cereal!

16:48.907 --> 16:50.204
Come on, man.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.869
Let's get his clothes
back on him, man, and...

16:52.945 --> 16:56.312
Let's get this
tape off his head.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.781
I just bought them damn Froot Loops!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.374
I got you, buddy.

16:59.451 --> 17:00.383
I got you, buddy.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.680
Yeah.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.619
Throw his ass in the
dumpster where he belongs.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.349
That ain't no way to be, Fish.

17:05.424 --> 17:09.588
St. Peter would never punch your
ticket out talking like that.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.252
Hoo!

17:17.069 --> 17:19.833
Here, let me replenish you.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.874
Coconut water...
a good source of electrolytes.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.874
Jesus!

17:25.944 --> 17:27.377
You smell like shit.

17:28.580 --> 17:32.016
Maybe that's me.

17:32.084 --> 17:35.781
I love you so much, Lloyd.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.766
Hoo!

18:32.845 --> 18:33.709
Hey, Lloyd.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.609
Hey, Vic.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.510
How you doin'?

18:35.581 --> 18:36.639
You find out anything?

18:36.715 --> 18:38.046
Vic, I went in there,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.881
turned everything upside down,
inch by inch.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.853
What we got to eat?

18:44.656 --> 18:46.419
Nigga, those are my
Joseph Cannoli Loafers

18:46.492 --> 18:47.516
on your feet right now.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.719
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.852
These are my new house shoes.

18:49.928 --> 18:50.860
House shoes?

18:50.929 --> 18:52.920
Those are my loafers, man.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.198
Surprise!

18:58.170 --> 18:59.603
Didn't I surprise you?

18:59.671 --> 19:01.332
Come on. Tell the truth.

19:01.406 --> 19:02.373
I got you, didn't i?

19:02.441 --> 19:04.341
Yeah, Fish think he slick, huh?

19:04.409 --> 19:05.376
Think he fooled old Vic.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.536
He can't fool you.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.671
Take your funky-ass feet
out of my loafers, man.

19:08.747 --> 19:09.714
You got it.

19:09.781 --> 19:10.645
Looky there, brother.

19:10.716 --> 19:11.546
Looky there.

19:11.617 --> 19:12.549
Beautiful.

19:12.618 --> 19:13.983
All right, there you go.

19:14.052 --> 19:14.984
Looky there.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.384
Ooh.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.581
Whoo!

19:17.656 --> 19:20.124
I think I'm gonna start
my three days right now.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.386
Hoo.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.792
What is the thread
count on these sheets?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.830
Hey, baby.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.629
How was your night, huh?

19:29.701 --> 19:33.102
I didn't see the
J's in the closet.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.005
Oh, you know, uh, Fish making
that custom case for me,

19:36.074 --> 19:39.669
you know, with the rat fur and
custom foam on the inside.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.542
Ay, dios mio.

19:41.613 --> 19:42.773
Yeah, well...

19:42.848 --> 19:44.509
I got to go all out for my J's.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.743
Well, they're yours.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.718
You can lock them
away if you want.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.652
Hey, baby, um...

19:50.722 --> 19:53.418
So what was the
big emergency last night?

19:53.492 --> 19:55.756
So I initially got called in
just to redo some paperwork

19:55.827 --> 19:58.057
that mysteriously disappeared
out of freaking nowhere, right?

19:59.231 --> 20:01.199
But then get this...
these idiots broke

20:01.266 --> 20:03.461
into the Compton boarding
stables last night

20:03.535 --> 20:04.934
but not to steal the horses

20:05.003 --> 20:06.766
but to steal the horse manure.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.135
Can you believe that?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.174
Mierda!

20:09.241 --> 20:10.833
What?

20:10.909 --> 20:11.807
Some boo boo?

20:11.877 --> 20:12.969
Boo boo, baby.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.740
Oh, that is...
that's crazy.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.405
But then the idiots
left the gate open

20:16.481 --> 20:17.709
to the boarding stables.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.877
Three or four horses got out...
expensive ones.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.285
Oh, we've been getting calls
from all over Compton,

20:23.355 --> 20:25.721
so I'll be following
up on that all day.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.055
Oh, wow, baby,
that sound like one big mess.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.117
This is what we
call our fun days.

20:31.597 --> 20:32.689
What's wrong, baby?

20:32.764 --> 20:33.753
Huh?

20:33.832 --> 20:36.198
You look really tired.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.429
What did you get
into last night?

20:38.503 --> 20:39.561
Oh, you know.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.629
Same shit.

20:44.500 --> 20:52.500
