Friend-Finder said he's here, but...

01:33.920 --> 01:36.221
Magnum?

01:36.256 --> 01:38.891
Magnum.

01:38.925 --> 01:41.226
(MUTTERS)
- Magnum.

01:41.261 --> 01:43.629
MAGNUM: Uh, hey, uh, over here.

01:44.898 --> 01:47.800
I've been calling you.
Where have you been?

01:47.834 --> 01:49.635
What's that? (BELL CLANGS SOFTLY)

01:49.669 --> 01:52.738
Step aside, Magnum.

(LAUGHS)

01:55.442 --> 01:58.310
Are you seriously trying
to hide a goat from me?

01:58.344 --> 01:59.878
I wasn't trying to hide the goat.

02:02.515 --> 02:05.250
Okay, maybe I was trying to hide
the goat just a little bit.

02:05.285 --> 02:06.819
Ah, she's pretty adorable.

02:06.853 --> 02:07.986
Her name's Ellie.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.822
(CHUCKLES): She's super sweet.

02:09.856 --> 02:12.180
- Where did you find her?
- Wait.

02:12.214 --> 02:13.325
Oh, my God.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.494
You accepted this goat
as payment, didn't you?

02:15.528 --> 02:17.863
Mr. Castro was short on cash.
What am I gonna do?

02:17.897 --> 02:20.999
Magnum, we've had this
discussion so many times.

02:21.034 --> 02:24.002
We do not barter our services
for homemade pies...

02:24.037 --> 02:24.937
Those things lasted a month.

02:24.971 --> 02:27.011
- ...crocheted sweaters...
- It was very soft.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.240
Who wears a sweater in Hawaii?

02:28.274 --> 02:29.775
And we don't work for livestock.

02:29.809 --> 02:31.043
I mean, she's better than a lawn mower.

02:31.077 --> 02:32.836
You should see her eat grass.
She's like a machine.

02:32.870 --> 02:35.681
You're gonna call Mr. Castro
and demand some actual payment.

02:35.715 --> 02:37.216
Nice goat.

02:37.884 --> 02:40.619
Let me guess. You sent Jack out

02:40.653 --> 02:43.362
to get your money, and he came
back with some beans.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.143
Ellie is much better than some beans.

02:45.177 --> 02:46.925
Eh, not really. You can eat beans.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.463
You're supposed to be on my side.

02:48.497 --> 02:50.863
TC, thank you so much for
filling in for me on this case.

02:50.897 --> 02:51.930
Well, you got a clipped wing.

02:51.965 --> 02:53.766
Glad I could pitch in.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.300
Is this suit really necessary?

02:55.335 --> 02:56.969
It adds a certain air of authority.

02:57.003 --> 02:58.937
I think it'll really help
with the interrogation.

02:58.972 --> 03:00.706
Your size doesn't hurt, either.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.326
- He means you're big and scary.
- (TC CHUCKLES)

03:02.360 --> 03:03.600
Why I got to be scary?

03:03.634 --> 03:05.450
It just... it might be a clichÃ©,

03:05.484 --> 03:06.612
but the good cop/bad cop thing works,

03:06.646 --> 03:08.547
and, well, since Magnum here
isn't exactly

03:08.581 --> 03:10.315
innately intimidating...

03:10.350 --> 03:11.650
I can be intimidating.

03:11.684 --> 03:13.051
- Not really.
- Mm...

03:13.086 --> 03:14.987
It's not about who's
the most intimidating,

03:15.021 --> 03:16.488
it's about getting the job done.

03:16.523 --> 03:18.824
And the good cop/bad cop thing works.

03:18.858 --> 03:21.560
So remember: bad cop, good cop.

03:21.594 --> 03:22.828
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Okay.

03:22.862 --> 03:25.497
Okay, quiet. Behave. This is our client.

03:25.532 --> 03:26.632
Mr. Kahele.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.667
Hi. I'm here with Mr. Magnum

03:28.701 --> 03:29.935
and our associate Mr. Calvin.

03:29.969 --> 03:31.570
They're about to head out to you now.

03:31.604 --> 03:32.838
Oh, great.

03:32.872 --> 03:34.573
- Everything set up?
- Yes.

03:34.607 --> 03:35.808
I did everything you asked.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.309
You really think this will work?

03:37.343 --> 03:38.477
HIGGINS: Mr. Kahele,

03:38.511 --> 03:40.479
we can assure you that it will.

03:40.513 --> 03:41.747
Right, boys?

03:41.781 --> 03:43.582
Yes.

03:43.616 --> 03:44.650
(LOW-PITCHED): Yes.

03:44.684 --> 03:47.986
MAGNUM: So, as efficiency
experts, we are brought on

03:48.021 --> 03:49.855
to examine productivity, and we just want

03:49.889 --> 03:51.824
to get a sense of everyone's role here.

03:51.858 --> 03:52.991
So I'm not in trouble?

03:53.026 --> 03:54.493
No, absolutely not.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.862
Uh, can you tell us the hardest part

03:56.896 --> 03:58.430
- about your job?
- MAN: <i>With sales,</i>

03:58.464 --> 04:00.432
it's all about keeping those numbers up.

04:00.466 --> 04:03.302
But, you know, most folks
won't buy anything

04:03.336 --> 04:04.937
until you convince them they need it.

04:04.971 --> 04:06.872
I follow basic security protocols.

04:06.906 --> 04:09.107
- Such as?
- Hourly patrols,

04:09.142 --> 04:10.943
always being vigilant.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.477
You'd be surprised how many people

04:12.512 --> 04:13.946
wander in pretending to work here

04:13.980 --> 04:15.080
just to use the john.

04:16.082 --> 04:17.815
Yeah, um...

04:17.851 --> 04:20.619
So, can you describe the most

04:20.653 --> 04:22.120
challenging part of your job?

04:22.155 --> 04:25.557
Well, I'm I.T., so spam.

04:25.592 --> 04:27.459
A-Also,

04:27.493 --> 04:30.062
uh, people looking at porn
on their work computers.

04:30.096 --> 04:31.784
And, you know, one click,

04:31.818 --> 04:34.132
you can download enough malware
to crash the entire system.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.500
Can you tell us about a time

04:35.535 --> 04:37.598
when you worked together as
a team to solve an issue?

04:37.623 --> 04:39.738
WOMAN: It's not a lot of teamwork here.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.708
It's pretty cutthroat.

04:42.742 --> 04:43.909
- Mm.
- Mm.

04:43.943 --> 04:46.778
("TOMI TOMI" BY THE POLYNESIANS PLAYING)

05:05.344 --> 05:06.311
Well.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.401
Your shoulder healed up fast.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.536
Thought you were doing inventory.

05:12.705 --> 05:14.673
You're not really hurt, are you?

05:14.707 --> 05:16.541
You know...

05:16.576 --> 05:18.677
I think it's this delicious Scotch.

05:18.711 --> 05:21.013
It just sort of loosened it up a bit.

05:21.047 --> 05:23.015
Well, it's good Scotch,
but it's not that good.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.257
Why the fake injury?

05:28.888 --> 05:31.523
All right, fine.

05:32.149 --> 05:34.092
I thought it was the best way
to get out of working

05:34.127 --> 05:36.962
the Sun-Smooth case,
and that is all I wish to say

05:36.996 --> 05:38.238
about it.

05:39.232 --> 05:41.533
You know, I sometimes tend bar here.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.936
And it's my job
to lend a sympathetic ear.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.454
Rick...

05:46.005 --> 05:48.874
I would really appreciate it
if we could drop the matter.

05:48.908 --> 05:50.075
If I could just say one thing.

05:50.109 --> 05:51.105
I just... I'd rather you didn't.

05:51.139 --> 05:53.645

05:55.181 --> 05:56.915
that's not a good thing.

05:56.950 --> 05:59.484
But he's never
going to find out about it.

05:59.519 --> 06:01.086
Is he?

06:03.388 --> 06:04.923
Not from me.

06:07.026 --> 06:08.560

<i>you've dealt with on other jobs.</i>

Uh, I guess that'd have to be the travel.

06:35.788 --> 06:38.457
What consulting firm are you with again?

06:38.491 --> 06:40.859

06:40.893 --> 06:42.928
Boutique firm. Right.

06:46.515 --> 06:47.933

06:47.967 --> 06:49.601
You're not corporate efficiency experts.

06:49.635 --> 06:50.936
You're a P.I.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.938
Don't know who you are, but I'm guessing

06:52.972 --> 06:54.272
you work with him.

06:54.307 --> 06:55.974
I think you're mistaken.

06:57.643 --> 06:59.678
You really don't remember me?

06:59.712 --> 07:01.680
My wife hired you to follow me.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.490
Last year.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.851
We had a run-in at the Halekulani.

07:05.885 --> 07:08.186
I gave you a panda eye? Bop. Remember?

07:15.878 --> 07:18.130
I think you're confusing me
for someone else.

07:18.164 --> 07:20.665
(SIGHS) Come on, man. Don't play dumb.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.134
I haven't punched anyone in the face

07:22.168 --> 07:23.902
since Randy Flynn in ninth grade.

07:23.936 --> 07:26.038
You think I'm not gonna
remember some guy I hit?

07:31.309 --> 07:32.878
How is your wife?

07:32.912 --> 07:36.048
Ex-wife. She divorced me.

07:36.082 --> 07:37.824
I lost half of everything, thanks to you.

07:37.859 --> 07:40.185
You mean thanks to you
stepping out on her.

07:42.922 --> 07:45.690
When they told us consultants were here

07:45.725 --> 07:47.070
to evaluate us,

07:47.104 --> 07:49.327
I thought I was gonna end up
jobless and homeless, too.

07:49.362 --> 07:51.329
So what is going on here?

07:51.364 --> 07:53.632
Look, man, we can't even
talk to you about it right now.

07:57.036 --> 07:59.704
Well, I guess I'm just
gonna have to out you, then.

08:01.307 --> 08:02.926
Why would you want to do that?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.343
Because everybody is on edge.

08:05.378 --> 08:06.945
They think their jobs are on the line.

08:06.979 --> 08:09.047
You can't do that to people.

08:11.984 --> 08:13.018
MAGNUM: Okay.

08:13.052 --> 08:14.619
Couple of weeks ago,

08:14.654 --> 08:16.788
a Sun-Smooth employee
died here in the building.

08:16.823 --> 08:18.123
Yeah, Glenn Travers. Upper management.

08:18.157 --> 08:20.992
Had an accident,
fell down the stairs and...

08:21.848 --> 08:23.582
Wait, was there something more to it?

08:23.617 --> 08:25.551
Well, Glenn was a 40-year-old triathlete.

08:25.585 --> 08:27.720
No prior health issues. You're
telling me a guy like that

08:27.754 --> 08:29.722
just falls down the stairs and dies?

08:29.756 --> 08:31.724
And plus, the-the security
camera in the stairwell

08:31.758 --> 08:32.892
was pointed up

08:32.926 --> 08:34.894
when this supposedly happened.

08:34.928 --> 08:37.462
You ask us, it's kind of suspicious.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.433
S-So you're saying Glenn's death

08:40.467 --> 08:41.756
wasn't an accident?

08:41.791 --> 08:43.135
Your boss thinks he was murdered.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.804
MAGNUM: And we were hired

08:44.838 --> 08:46.806
to find out which one of you did it.

08:49.138 --> 08:50.999
Why the hell would you
tell him about that?

08:51.024 --> 08:52.991
He was prone to allergies.
I didn't want...

08:53.026 --> 08:54.235
I couldn't let him use the lotion...

08:54.269 --> 08:56.762
GLENN: You're not a damn doctor, Norma.

08:56.796 --> 08:58.496
If you were smart enough to do that,

08:58.530 --> 09:00.198
you wouldn't be doing this.

09:03.205 --> 09:04.312
When did you shoot that?

09:04.346 --> 09:06.180
Three weeks ago.

09:06.215 --> 09:08.449
I sit two cubicles over from her.

09:08.483 --> 09:10.518
Wasn't the nicest guy, huh?

09:10.552 --> 09:13.487
I-I don't want to say anything
negative about the dead, but...

09:13.522 --> 09:15.923
he was kind of a dick
these past few months.

09:15.958 --> 09:17.491
I mean, he wasn't always, though.

09:17.526 --> 09:19.427
- What changed?
- I don't know.

09:19.461 --> 09:21.262
I mean, Glenn was awesome.

09:21.296 --> 09:22.964
Then, overnight, he went from being

09:22.998 --> 09:24.098
the guy you'd do anything for

09:24.132 --> 09:26.467
to being the guy that
made you dread coming to work.

09:26.501 --> 09:28.870
He started riding everyone.

09:28.904 --> 09:30.104
Especially Norma.

09:31.173 --> 09:33.007
Shouldn't the cops be looking into this?

09:34.009 --> 09:35.877
They haven't been notified.

09:35.911 --> 09:37.511
'Cause of the takeover, right?

09:37.546 --> 09:39.213
- You know about that?
- Dude.

09:39.248 --> 09:40.882
Everyone knows.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.884
Some big-ass company
wants to gobble us up.

09:42.918 --> 09:44.318
Everybody's scared about that, too.

09:44.353 --> 09:45.653
- It means layoffs are coming.
- MAGNUM: Yeah.

09:45.687 --> 09:47.221
Sun-Smooth doesn't want the controversy

09:47.256 --> 09:48.656
of a homicide investigation.

09:48.690 --> 09:50.491
Especially if it turns out to be nothing.

09:50.525 --> 09:52.531
Still, your boss wants
to do the right thing.

09:52.565 --> 09:54.478
He just wants to keep it on the low.

09:54.512 --> 09:55.863
Totally get that.

09:56.621 --> 09:58.165
Where were you when Glenn died?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.200
Uh...

09:59.234 --> 10:01.469
Maui. Meeting with clients.

10:01.503 --> 10:02.937
Can we confirm that?

10:04.172 --> 10:05.406
W-Why would I lie?

10:05.440 --> 10:06.874
Well, if you killed Glenn, you would have

10:06.909 --> 10:09.076
a really good reason to lie.

10:09.884 --> 10:11.178
But-but I didn't.

10:11.213 --> 10:13.481
(STAMMERS) Honestly, man,

10:13.515 --> 10:15.349
I-I didn't-I didn't do it.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.104
How would you like to help us?

10:21.456 --> 10:25.092
Whoa. Hang on.

10:25.127 --> 10:27.094
Can I talk to you?

10:27.129 --> 10:29.230
Sure. Just one-one second.

10:33.735 --> 10:35.376
(WHISPERING): What are you doing?

10:35.410 --> 10:37.703
Well, he already knows
who we are and why we're here.

10:37.737 --> 10:41.008
Plus, there's a lot of employees
here, and, uh, I don't know,

10:41.043 --> 10:42.761
might be good to have
somebody on the inside.

10:42.795 --> 10:45.837
- Yeah, what if he blabs?
- He's not gonna blab.

10:48.283 --> 10:50.184
He looks like a blabber.

10:50.218 --> 10:53.220
Mm, little bit.
But trust me, it's gonna work.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.590
So, what do you say?

10:56.625 --> 10:59.060
I kind of make a great spy.

10:59.094 --> 11:01.329
I was thinking the same thing.

11:14.276 --> 11:15.742
Are you sulking?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.580
I'm not sulking.

11:20.615 --> 11:22.083
Rick, you're a little sulky.

11:22.117 --> 11:24.218
Okay, yes, I am sulking.

11:24.252 --> 11:25.386
Because I lied to Magnum?

11:25.420 --> 11:27.853
No, because you made
a liar out of me, too.

11:27.887 --> 11:31.158
- How so?
- Because of this. This thing.

11:31.193 --> 11:33.961
I know the truth, and the truth sucks

11:33.996 --> 11:37.131
'cause it's making me lie
to my best friend.

11:37.555 --> 11:39.000
Okay.

11:39.034 --> 11:41.435
I understand the quandary
that I'm putting you in

11:41.470 --> 11:43.170
and I am sorry.

11:43.205 --> 11:44.672
But I have my reasons.

11:44.706 --> 11:47.141
- Well, then tell them to Thomas.
- I can't.

11:47.175 --> 11:48.442
He will understand. I promise.

11:48.477 --> 11:50.485
Rick...

11:52.753 --> 11:54.015
it's embarrassing.

11:57.742 --> 12:00.254
Look, we all do stupid things,

12:00.288 --> 12:02.123
like, uh,

12:02.157 --> 12:05.192
buy a bar with no
business plan or capital,

12:05.227 --> 12:08.129
or get caught shoplifting
when you're a kid

12:08.163 --> 12:10.164
and have your crooked uncle
have to pay off the cops

12:10.198 --> 12:12.033
so they look the other way.

12:12.674 --> 12:14.635
The point is, it's life,

12:14.669 --> 12:16.704
and a part of living

12:16.738 --> 12:19.340
is having a past full of mistakes.

12:20.883 --> 12:23.150
And whatever yours is,

12:23.345 --> 12:25.513
Thomas will understand.

12:27.416 --> 12:30.618
That's the beauty of that guy,
he-he doesn't judge.

12:31.526 --> 12:32.902
Perhaps.

12:33.688 --> 12:35.689
But I do.

12:35.724 --> 12:37.912
Myself, most harshly.

12:37.946 --> 12:40.061
And any imperfections of my character,

12:40.095 --> 12:42.430
and this mistake...

12:44.199 --> 12:45.766
...showed great weakness.

12:51.239 --> 12:53.040
MAGNUM: That's the camera that was found

12:53.075 --> 12:55.142
pointed up.
This is where Glenn's body was.

12:55.177 --> 12:57.178
It's got a pretty good angle of the spot.

12:57.719 --> 12:59.113
Yeah.

13:00.415 --> 13:02.316
But if you do this...

13:04.352 --> 13:05.853
Not so much.

13:05.887 --> 13:07.555
Our client said Glenn preferred

13:07.589 --> 13:09.223
to take the stairs over the elevator.

13:09.257 --> 13:11.225
Yeah, so if you planned on
knocking him down the stairs,

13:11.259 --> 13:12.860
you would take care
of the camera beforehand.

13:12.894 --> 13:15.229
You wouldn't even have to be
as tall as you to point it up.

13:15.263 --> 13:17.398
Yeah, and that leaves just about
everybody that works here

13:17.432 --> 13:20.701
as a suspect. And they got,
like, 100 employees.

13:23.238 --> 13:24.746
Hey, TC.

13:26.965 --> 13:28.383
Check it out.

13:29.578 --> 13:32.213
Oh, disposable vape pen.

13:32.247 --> 13:34.181
(SNIFFS)

13:34.216 --> 13:36.756
Looks like somebody was getting
their smoke on up in here.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.586
It's got some lipstick on it, too.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.788
It's a female worker
who was probably on this floor,

13:40.822 --> 13:44.325
and if she came here often,
maybe she saw something.

13:46.761 --> 13:49.228
TC: I used to have one of those.

13:50.431 --> 13:51.765
The patch.

13:53.602 --> 13:54.869
Oh, yeah?

13:54.903 --> 13:57.304
Yeah. It worked pretty good, too.

13:57.339 --> 13:59.406
Except, uh...

13:59.441 --> 14:01.475
I would still sneak a smoke every day.

14:01.510 --> 14:02.843
How about you?

14:04.246 --> 14:05.579
Yeah, me, too.

14:05.614 --> 14:07.414
Let me guess.

14:07.449 --> 14:09.216
Disposable vape pen?

14:09.251 --> 14:12.153
- How did you know?
- Well,

14:12.187 --> 14:14.488
we found one in the stairwell.

14:15.010 --> 14:16.377
That was you?

14:16.756 --> 14:18.159
Maybe.

14:18.785 --> 14:20.594
- Uh, you mind if I ask...
- Okay, look,

14:20.629 --> 14:22.563
I know I'm supposed to smoke outside,

14:22.597 --> 14:26.300
but it just takes ten minutes
to go up and down the elevator,

14:26.334 --> 14:29.236
and it's way more efficient for
me to smoke in the stairwell.

14:29.271 --> 14:31.639
I know it's not allowed,
and I know I shouldn't do it,

14:31.673 --> 14:34.608
but, honestly, I only do it to save time.

14:35.324 --> 14:37.678
So it was you that moved the camera then?

14:38.604 --> 14:41.282
Yeah. I don't want to get caught.

14:41.316 --> 14:42.616
Am I fired?

14:42.651 --> 14:44.318
No, sis.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.789
So maybe the killer got lucky

14:48.823 --> 14:50.491
that she pointed the camera up.

14:50.525 --> 14:52.458
Yeah, seems that way.

14:53.228 --> 14:54.762
So what's next?

14:54.796 --> 14:57.264
Well, I had Todd look into Norma.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.201
The one that Glenn
was chewing out on the video?

15:00.235 --> 15:02.303
It seems like Glenn
really had it out for her.

15:02.337 --> 15:04.171
Maybe she just got tired of it.

15:10.745 --> 15:13.547
I thought people only met in
dark parking lots in the movies.

15:13.582 --> 15:15.516
This is kind of cool. (ALL CHUCKLE)

15:15.550 --> 15:17.318
Well, you know, if we keep
meeting in the office,

15:17.352 --> 15:18.819
people might get suspicious.

15:18.853 --> 15:21.488
Oh, yeah. That's a good point.

15:21.523 --> 15:22.489
So, did you find anything?

15:22.524 --> 15:24.291
Yeah, so I'm, uh,

15:24.326 --> 15:26.193
I'm tight with Norma's assistant.

15:26.228 --> 15:27.561
She's kind of into me.

15:27.596 --> 15:28.829
- You know, she's pretty cute, too.
- Todd, Todd.

15:28.863 --> 15:30.731
- Focus, focus.
- Right, uh,

15:30.765 --> 15:32.967
so Norma was out sick

15:33.001 --> 15:34.068
the week that Glenn died.

15:34.102 --> 15:37.571
So that clears her.
That's two down and 98 to go.

15:37.606 --> 15:40.241
Okay. Is there anybody else
you might think

15:40.275 --> 15:41.408
could want to hurt Glenn?

15:41.443 --> 15:43.310
Take your pick. I mean,

15:43.345 --> 15:46.347
Glenn was president of sales.

15:46.381 --> 15:48.515
Everyone who reported to him...
which was most of us...

15:48.550 --> 15:49.883
we all hated his guts.

15:49.918 --> 15:51.352
Man, we really got to figure out a way

15:51.386 --> 15:53.020
to narrow down this list of suspects.

15:53.054 --> 15:55.522
You know, maybe we're going
about this the wrong way.

15:55.557 --> 15:56.810
If we're just looking into people

15:56.844 --> 15:58.993
that might have an ax
to grind with Glenn,

15:59.027 --> 16:00.427
it's not gonna get us far.

16:00.462 --> 16:02.263
We should start looking into people

16:02.297 --> 16:04.265
who were actually nice to him.

16:04.299 --> 16:07.034
Oh, like somebody
that was planting an alibi

16:07.068 --> 16:08.569
by being too nice.

16:08.603 --> 16:10.938
Oh, that's easy. Cal Harper.

16:10.972 --> 16:12.906
He manages retail chain sales.

16:12.941 --> 16:14.235
He's a major kiss-ass.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.710
He'd do a-a coffee run
for Glenn every afternoon.

16:16.745 --> 16:19.513
I'm talking, like, every day.
I mean, dude had no shame.

16:19.547 --> 16:22.349
Actually, uh, mm...

16:22.384 --> 16:23.498
Here.

16:23.532 --> 16:26.020
All right, that's Cal at-at

16:26.054 --> 16:28.289
company picnic last year.

16:28.323 --> 16:29.577
Although, I don't think

16:29.611 --> 16:31.292
he's got the stones
to kill anyone. (CHUCKLES)

16:31.326 --> 16:32.693
You never know.

16:32.727 --> 16:34.361
Might be worth looking into.

16:34.396 --> 16:35.963
Okay, okay. So how do we proceed?

16:35.997 --> 16:39.933
Uh... You know what?

16:39.968 --> 16:44.157
Why don't you go to
Leonard's Bakery, pick up, say,

16:44.191 --> 16:45.773
100 malasadas.

16:45.807 --> 16:49.076
Malasadas, okay. I could
do that. I could do that.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.160
Bakeries are, like, my thing. Yeah.

16:51.194 --> 16:52.546
What are you thinking?

16:52.580 --> 16:54.915
Well, I'm thinking, company of this size,

16:54.949 --> 16:56.417
it's always someone's birthday.

16:56.451 --> 16:59.987
Mm. Get a couple
of cinnamon sugars, please

17:00.021 --> 17:04.290
ALL: âª Happy birthday to you âª

17:04.326 --> 17:08.013
âª Happy birthday to you âª

17:08.048 --> 17:10.507
âª Happy birthday âª

17:10.540 --> 17:12.766
âª Dear Marcus âª

17:12.800 --> 17:15.069
âª Happy birthday âª

17:15.103 --> 17:17.338
âª To you. âª

17:17.372 --> 17:19.406
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE IN DISTANCE)

17:23.611 --> 17:26.347
Brilliant move, TM.

17:26.381 --> 17:29.650
And our boy, Todd, out there,
he ain't doing too bad.

17:29.684 --> 17:31.518
Well, as long as it gives us enough time

17:31.553 --> 17:32.986
to download Cal's hard drive.

17:33.021 --> 17:35.089
Hopefully, we can find a motive.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.491
I got to say, TM, I mean,
people don't seem

17:37.525 --> 17:39.827
to be too heartbroken that Glenn died.

17:39.861 --> 17:42.629
I can't blame 'em.
You saw him on that video.

17:42.664 --> 17:44.932
Dude was obviously a first-class jerk.

17:44.966 --> 17:47.801
That's true, but doesn't mean
the guy deserved to die.

17:47.836 --> 17:49.002
I mean, this isn't about
what kind of person

17:49.037 --> 17:50.459
he was. This is about

17:50.493 --> 17:51.805
right and wrong.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.941
- I knew you would say that.
- (KNOCKING)

17:55.410 --> 17:59.146
Oh, hey, Mr. Peele.
How can we help you, man?

17:59.180 --> 18:02.116
I-I was just gonna do
a systems update. (CHUCKLES)

18:02.150 --> 18:03.449
What are you guys doing here?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.153
Oh, we were just, uh, going
through some sales numbers.

18:06.187 --> 18:08.155
N-No interest in the party?

18:08.189 --> 18:10.657
I hear those malasadas are pretty tasty.

18:10.692 --> 18:12.193
Yeah, you know, I didn't get an invite.

18:12.227 --> 18:14.897
Nobody ever invites
me to stuff like that.

18:14.922 --> 18:15.949
Really?

18:15.984 --> 18:18.665
Well, th-that's something we
should definitely take note of,

18:18.700 --> 18:20.801
because part of what we're
doing here is to make sure that

18:20.835 --> 18:24.138
the company is all-inclusive
and it's across the board.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.673
Well, thanks. I'd appreciate that.

18:26.708 --> 18:29.576
Just gonna be a couple
more minutes. Good?

18:29.611 --> 18:31.145
Oh, yeah, no, no.
Go ahead, take your time.

18:31.179 --> 18:32.579
Take your time. Okay.

18:32.614 --> 18:34.381
Bye.

18:43.057 --> 18:44.391
WOMAN: <i>Mahalo.</i>

18:45.399 --> 18:47.127
Have a good one.

18:50.632 --> 18:53.066
What, bruh, you guys going to a funeral?

18:53.101 --> 18:55.569
No, just working a case.

18:55.603 --> 18:58.672
Yeah. P.I., too, now, huh?

19:00.208 --> 19:03.076
No, I'm just helping these guys
while Higgy's on the mend.

19:04.712 --> 19:06.046
Or maybe you need some extra money.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.548
Business not going so well?

19:07.582 --> 19:09.104
Island Hoppers is doing just fine.

19:09.139 --> 19:11.418
Damn near got more business
than we can handle.

19:11.453 --> 19:13.120
KAMEKONA: Yeah? If you're so busy,

19:13.154 --> 19:15.422
how can you afford to take a day off?

19:18.226 --> 19:19.760
Is our food ready yet?

19:21.095 --> 19:22.563
Here it is.

19:22.597 --> 19:25.899
Enjoy your grindz, P.I.

19:27.168 --> 19:29.136
Hey, TC,

19:29.170 --> 19:30.571
don't worry about it.

19:30.605 --> 19:31.905
He's just busting your balls, man.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.906
Yeah, I'm about to bust his, too.

19:34.609 --> 19:37.110
A whole lot more. Trust me.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.713
How's the shoulder doing?

19:41.317 --> 19:42.369
Why?

19:42.798 --> 19:45.185
Because I'm curious
if you're getting better.

19:46.654 --> 19:47.921
Yeah. Yes.

19:47.956 --> 19:50.224
It's convalescing
quite nicely. Thank you.

19:50.258 --> 19:52.226
Anything on the hard drive?

19:52.260 --> 19:54.661
Well, if Cal was angry with
Glenn, there's nothing about it

19:54.696 --> 19:56.530
in any of his e-mails or texts.

19:58.032 --> 19:59.166
Wait.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.169
This is interesting. One of Cal's

20:02.203 --> 20:04.171
web searches prior
to Glenn Travers' sudden

20:04.205 --> 20:07.140
and unexpected demise
was undetectable poisons.

20:07.175 --> 20:09.009
Specifically, those that can be ingested.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.617
Some of these could cause a heart attack.

20:10.642 --> 20:14.181
Wait a minute, didn't Cal deliver
Glenn coffee every afternoon?

20:14.215 --> 20:15.706
Yeah, according to Todd.

20:15.740 --> 20:17.709
Be an easy way to poison someone.

20:17.743 --> 20:19.322
So maybe Glenn
wasn't pushed down the stairs,

20:19.356 --> 20:21.188
maybe he was poisoned and then he fell.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.337
Seems like Cal just became
our main suspect.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
So you think, turning off the AC,

20:32.021 --> 20:33.655
and giving Cal an extra short chair

20:33.690 --> 20:36.771
is gonna make him spill his guts
about killing Glenn?

20:36.806 --> 20:38.594
HIGGINS (OVER PHONE):
The point is to make him feel

20:38.628 --> 20:40.329
as uncomfortable as possible,

20:40.363 --> 20:42.431
so that Magnum can rescue him

20:42.465 --> 20:44.333
and build some kind of rapport.

20:44.367 --> 20:46.435
Remember, he's the good cop
to your bad cop.

20:46.469 --> 20:49.171
If we can get Cal
to feel like Magnum is an ally,

20:49.205 --> 20:50.973
he may feel free to be honest with him.

20:51.007 --> 20:53.208
We need to interrogate him
without it feeling like we are,

20:53.243 --> 20:55.344
so maybe we can get a motive out of him.

20:55.378 --> 20:58.447
In the meantime, I've retained
an independent pathologist to do

20:58.481 --> 21:00.015
a private autopsy on Mr. Travers

21:00.049 --> 21:02.384
so we can ascertain if there was
any poison in his system.

21:02.418 --> 21:05.320
And, also, Kumu just called.

21:05.355 --> 21:07.456
Mr. Castro is at Robin's Nest

21:07.490 --> 21:09.124
because you called him
to discuss the goat.

21:09.158 --> 21:10.692
Now I know you're working on this case,

21:10.727 --> 21:12.995
so I'm gonna have to
deal with it, but I...

21:13.029 --> 21:14.162
Hey, uh, Higgy, I got to go.

21:14.197 --> 21:16.365
Okay, I know you don't want
to discuss this right now,

21:16.399 --> 21:17.651
- but I would really...
- No, it's-it's not that.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.034
Uh, our suspect's here.

21:19.068 --> 21:20.902
How convenient.

21:21.416 --> 21:22.983
Good luck.

21:27.975 --> 21:29.081
So.

21:29.115 --> 21:30.929
How long do you plan on

21:30.963 --> 21:32.481
keeping up this little charade?

21:33.401 --> 21:34.516
I don't know.

21:35.277 --> 21:37.052
He's gonna find out, you know.

21:37.086 --> 21:39.073
He's a pretty good detective.

21:40.983 --> 21:42.350
Ah.

21:44.427 --> 21:46.061
Thought you gents could use a pick-me-up.

21:46.095 --> 21:47.696
(CHUCKLES) Double shot latte?

21:48.294 --> 21:49.564
No, thanks.

21:50.869 --> 21:51.935
Uh... sure.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.983
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

21:53.008 --> 21:54.008
Have-have a seat.

21:58.574 --> 22:00.008
That's me.

22:00.043 --> 22:02.277
Always anticipating things
before they come up.

22:02.312 --> 22:04.356
Sign of a good manager, am I right?

22:04.390 --> 22:06.048
That's what we're here to find out.

22:06.082 --> 22:07.549
See how efficiently

22:07.583 --> 22:09.603
things are running around here.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.389
Okay.

22:15.658 --> 22:17.726
How you doing? Little warm?

22:18.320 --> 22:20.462
Yeah, it's a... bit warm, thanks.

22:20.496 --> 22:22.032
Crank up the AC for you.

22:29.072 --> 22:30.272
Should be good.

22:30.306 --> 22:34.276
Okay, so, we evaluated your
performance over the past year,

22:34.310 --> 22:36.378
and we have to say,
it was quite excellent.

22:36.412 --> 22:38.046
Sales were up every quarter.

22:38.081 --> 22:39.648
- Yeah.
- Still...

22:39.682 --> 22:41.383
could've been better.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.289
You know, your seat seems
a little bit low.

22:47.323 --> 22:49.124
- Let me help you with that.
- Yeah.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.169
How's that?

22:51.194 --> 22:53.161
- Good.
- Good, perfect.

22:53.196 --> 22:55.030
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:56.532 --> 22:58.300
We'll cut to the chase, Cal.

22:58.334 --> 23:00.602
We're here to see
why sales weren't stronger.

23:00.636 --> 23:02.471
We know it wasn't the product.

23:02.505 --> 23:04.573
I mean, it's the best sunscreen
on the market.

23:04.607 --> 23:06.441
But we have a theory.

23:06.476 --> 23:08.443
Your late boss, Glenn Travers,

23:09.121 --> 23:10.612
he wasn't too popular.

23:10.646 --> 23:13.115
See, it seems like everybody 'round here

23:13.149 --> 23:14.583
had a little issue with him.

23:14.617 --> 23:17.152
We just want to know what yours was.

23:17.186 --> 23:19.621
See how that factored into things.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.656
MAGNUM: Look,
as long as you're straight with us,

23:21.691 --> 23:24.826
I can personally guarantee you
you will not lose your job.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.595
I don't know what to tell you.

23:26.629 --> 23:28.307
We had a good relationship.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.806
(EXHALES)

23:39.375 --> 23:40.509
It's been 30 minutes.

23:40.543 --> 23:41.777
This guy ain't breaking.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.312
Yeah, I know.

23:44.347 --> 23:46.314
Might have to turn up the heat
on this guy.

23:46.349 --> 23:49.184
How? I've been mad-dogging
the man since he sat down.

23:49.218 --> 23:51.520
I don't know how much more
"bad cop" I can get.

23:52.915 --> 23:54.723
How 'bout this?

23:54.757 --> 23:57.292
Imagine that's Kamekona
sitting across from you.

24:00.763 --> 24:02.132
I think I could work with that.

24:07.503 --> 24:08.837
Yeah, let's do this.

24:09.705 --> 24:11.540
All right, Cal.

24:11.574 --> 24:13.241
Time to cut the crap.

24:13.276 --> 24:15.410
'Cause best believe you ain't
gonna like where this is going

24:15.445 --> 24:16.411
if you keep playing us.

24:16.446 --> 24:17.512
CAL: Pl-Playing you?

24:17.547 --> 24:19.240
- What?
- Don't deny it.

24:19.274 --> 24:20.682
MAGNUM: Uh, hey-hey, Mr. Kelvin.

24:20.716 --> 24:22.551
Uh... give us a minute.

24:22.585 --> 24:25.720
You better remember
what I'm telling you, Cal.

24:32.496 --> 24:34.095
My God,

24:34.130 --> 24:35.597
what was that about?

24:35.631 --> 24:37.199
He knows you're lying about Glenn.

24:37.233 --> 24:38.956
I'm not. I swear.

24:38.990 --> 24:41.436
Oh, come on. No one's
relationship is perfect.

24:41.471 --> 24:42.871
You and Glenn must have had

24:42.905 --> 24:44.506
a disagreement at some point.

24:44.540 --> 24:46.541
And we're gonna find out about it.

24:46.576 --> 24:47.876
Trust me.

24:49.445 --> 24:50.579
All right, fine.

24:50.613 --> 24:52.280
There was an issue.

24:52.315 --> 24:53.582
Go on.

24:55.485 --> 24:57.586
The son of a bitch lied to me.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.367
Um...

25:16.772 --> 25:17.803
He break?

25:18.584 --> 25:21.142
He just said
Glenn promised him stock options

25:21.177 --> 25:22.310
if the acquisition went through.

25:22.345 --> 25:24.613
Found out Glenn was lying.
He wasn't getting anything,

25:24.647 --> 25:26.581
not a single share.

25:26.616 --> 25:28.750
Oh, so Glenn cost him
a whole lot of cash.

25:28.784 --> 25:31.286
Looks like we found our motive.

25:33.489 --> 25:34.890
(BLEATS)

25:34.924 --> 25:36.892
Mr. Castro, thanks for stopping by.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.560
Hey, Ms. Higgins.

25:38.594 --> 25:41.196
Looks like you guys
been taking good care of Ellie.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.632
She seems happy.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.700
Plenty of grass to eat.

25:48.304 --> 25:51.206
Yes, she's, uh, she's lovely.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.276
I offered Mr. Magnum a payment plan

25:54.310 --> 25:55.810
for solving my case,

25:55.845 --> 25:57.479
but he said he'd take Ellie instead.

25:57.513 --> 25:59.247
So, about that...

25:59.282 --> 26:02.651
I guess he told you
that the farm is going under.

26:02.685 --> 26:03.985
We're shutting down.

26:04.588 --> 26:06.006
Oh.

26:07.841 --> 26:10.220
Anyway, he called.

26:10.254 --> 26:12.054
He said he needed to see me.

26:12.088 --> 26:13.562
You know what it's about?

26:15.631 --> 26:17.332
- (BLEATS)
- Um...

26:17.366 --> 26:18.500
It's about Ellie, isn't it?

26:18.534 --> 26:21.303
You know, she can get fussy, but...

26:21.337 --> 26:23.638
couple of apples a day
usually fixes that.

26:27.743 --> 26:31.279
I... I'm sure that's what it was. Ellie.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.481
Thanks for the tip.

26:33.516 --> 26:35.617
You're welcome.

26:35.651 --> 26:37.385
Hey.

26:37.420 --> 26:38.520
Bye, girl.

26:38.554 --> 26:41.456
You're gonna be real happy here.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.758
These are good people.

26:47.931 --> 26:49.431
So long.

26:57.173 --> 27:00.609
Looks like Thomas isn't the
only softie around here.

27:02.731 --> 27:03.931
Hey, Cal.

27:09.852 --> 27:10.819
We need to talk.

27:10.853 --> 27:11.820
(DOOR CLOSES)

27:11.854 --> 27:13.054
I know what this is about.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.933
You do?

27:14.968 --> 27:17.492
Yeah. I'm gone.

27:17.526 --> 27:19.211
You're firing me.

27:19.245 --> 27:20.705
No, it's much worse than that.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.364
What do you mean?

27:22.398 --> 27:23.832
We're not corporate consultants.

27:23.866 --> 27:25.667
We're private investigators.

27:25.701 --> 27:27.087
I don't understand.

27:27.122 --> 27:28.503
Cal, I hired them

27:28.537 --> 27:30.338
to find out who murdered Glenn.

27:30.373 --> 27:31.573
What?

27:31.607 --> 27:33.541
Murdered? What are you...

27:33.576 --> 27:35.577
Glenn fell down the stairs.

27:35.611 --> 27:37.412
We think he was poisoned first.

27:37.446 --> 27:39.948
Best guess is arsenic,
which can cause heart attacks.

27:39.982 --> 27:41.516
You put it in his coffee, didn't you?

27:41.550 --> 27:43.585
The one you got for him every afternoon?

27:43.619 --> 27:46.287
Look, if you just admit what you did,

27:46.322 --> 27:47.922
things'll go so much easier for you.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.924
Okay, I got him coffee, yes.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.427
He was leaving the office a
lot in the middle of the day,

27:52.461 --> 27:54.193
and was always cranky when he got back.

27:54.227 --> 27:55.630
He was just easier to deal with

27:55.665 --> 27:57.098
after he got some caffeine in him.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.233
But I didn't poison him.

27:58.267 --> 28:00.602
Then how do you explain
the Tuesday before Glenn died,

28:00.636 --> 28:03.405
you were researching poison on
your office computer after work?

28:04.249 --> 28:05.440
Tuesday...

28:07.610 --> 28:09.369
That's not possible.

28:09.403 --> 28:11.079
I was not in the office that night.

28:11.113 --> 28:13.081
I was with my wife
at our son's school play.

28:13.115 --> 28:15.483
Not according to the security log

28:15.518 --> 28:16.484
in the parking garage.

28:16.519 --> 28:19.721
Says here that you were parked
until 10:32 p.m.

28:19.755 --> 28:20.689
Yeah, that's 'cause

28:20.723 --> 28:22.557
I snuck out of the office early
that night.

28:22.591 --> 28:24.059
I knew that Glenn sometimes
checked those logs

28:24.093 --> 28:26.561
and I didn't want him to know I took off.

28:26.595 --> 28:29.025
So I left my car in the garage,
took an Uber to school,

28:29.060 --> 28:30.532
then came back after the play.

28:30.566 --> 28:32.801
If you don't believe me,
you can check with the school.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.603
I was not in the office. I was not here.

28:39.508 --> 28:41.676
TC: <i>Looks like Cal was telling the truth.</i>

28:41.711 --> 28:43.478
He was at the play.

28:43.512 --> 28:45.262
So he's in the clear.

28:45.297 --> 28:46.490
Maybe.

28:46.524 --> 28:47.615
But it also means someone else

28:47.650 --> 28:49.484
was using Cal's computer
to research poison.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.686
Yes, but why... to frame him?

28:51.721 --> 28:53.455
Cover their tracks?

28:54.490 --> 28:56.491
So, the pathologist that we retained

28:56.525 --> 28:58.526
did some tests on the late Mr. Travers

28:58.561 --> 29:00.628
to see if there were
any substances from that list

29:00.663 --> 29:01.863
in his system.

29:01.897 --> 29:02.930
They found one,

29:02.965 --> 29:04.866
but it wasn't the one I was expecting.

29:04.900 --> 29:05.867
What was it?

29:05.901 --> 29:07.669
It was an antacid.

29:07.703 --> 29:09.437
- Antacid?
- Mm-hmm.

29:09.472 --> 29:11.539
You mean, the kind of stuff
you use for an upset stomach?

29:11.574 --> 29:13.007
Exactly. Except that Mr. Travers had

29:13.042 --> 29:14.976
five times the suggested amount
in his system.

29:15.010 --> 29:16.678
Could that cause a heart attack?

29:16.712 --> 29:18.513
An irregular heartbeat, perhaps.

29:18.547 --> 29:19.881
In some cases, a coma.

29:19.915 --> 29:21.483
But the associated symptoms

29:21.517 --> 29:25.019
would be nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, headache.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.021
Mr. Travers would have been
utterly miserable.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.691
So maybe this was an accident after all.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.626
Guy just fell down the stairs.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.061
Maybe, but it still doesn't explain

29:33.095 --> 29:35.730
why a Sun-Smooth employee
was researching poisons.

29:35.765 --> 29:37.460
Nor why Mr. Travers had an excess

29:37.494 --> 29:40.034
of one of those substances
on the list in his system.

29:40.069 --> 29:43.071
I think, clearly,
someone meant to do him harm.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.297
So this ain't over.

29:45.331 --> 29:47.208
No. Definitely not over.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.444
Just got more complicated.

29:53.218 --> 29:55.986
So here's a list of people
that were in the building

29:56.021 --> 29:58.856
the day the search was done
on Cal's computer.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.262
- Which means...
- One of 'em's our perp.

30:00.296 --> 30:01.675
I'm way ahead of you, dawg.

30:03.452 --> 30:04.895
Man, why don't you just tell us

30:04.929 --> 30:06.397
if any of them had it out for Glenn?

30:06.431 --> 30:09.967
Okay, sure. Uh, let's see. We got...

30:12.003 --> 30:13.904
Buh-buh-buh-buh- buh-buh-buh. Mm...

30:13.938 --> 30:16.040
Susie Nakamura, Glenn's old assistant.

30:16.074 --> 30:19.043
Got hammered at the corporate
retreat. You should've seen her.

30:19.077 --> 30:19.977
She was talking trash about him.

30:20.011 --> 30:21.078
Definitely worth a look.

30:21.112 --> 30:22.313
- Mm-hmm.
- Um... Buh-buh

30:22.347 --> 30:23.247
buh-buh... Oh.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.045
Malcolm Hayes was convinced

30:25.079 --> 30:26.216
Glenn had it in for him.

30:26.251 --> 30:27.418
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean,

30:27.452 --> 30:29.192
I think I like him for this, too.

30:29.226 --> 30:30.254
Okay.

30:30.288 --> 30:31.555
Uh, who else we got...

30:31.589 --> 30:33.865
Ooh. Josh Lieberman.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.392
Got passed over for a promotion,

30:35.427 --> 30:37.261
but Josh is way too much
of a wuss to kill anyone.

30:37.295 --> 30:40.264
So, um, what's-what's our next move?

30:40.298 --> 30:41.447
What are we doing? What are we doing?

30:41.481 --> 30:43.067
Well, your next move would probably be

30:43.101 --> 30:44.268
to go up to the office and just

30:44.302 --> 30:46.236
await further instruction.

30:47.272 --> 30:49.006
So you're saying I-I should go

30:49.040 --> 30:50.421
back to the office.

30:50.456 --> 30:53.177
Yeah, we'll let you know
if we need anything else, dawg.

30:53.211 --> 30:55.212
All right, roger that.

30:55.246 --> 30:56.421
Thanks, Todd.

30:59.884 --> 31:01.051
We should probably look
into those three people.

31:01.086 --> 31:02.853
And in the meantime, I'm also gonna

31:02.887 --> 31:04.288
text Higgins, see if she can track down

31:04.322 --> 31:06.457
that CCTV footage from the building.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.459
I thought you two already did
that and came up empty.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.127
Well, we did, but I want to see
if she can track down

31:10.161 --> 31:12.296
- Cal's coffee run the day Glenn died.
- Ah.

31:12.330 --> 31:14.131
So you think somebody
spiked it along the way?

31:14.165 --> 31:15.966
Well, it's still
the perfect delivery system.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.035
And although it may not have been Cal,

31:18.069 --> 31:19.503
it could be somebody else.

31:20.939 --> 31:23.396
TC: So we heard a rumor you
were being very critical

31:23.431 --> 31:25.576
of your old boss at the retreat, Susie.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.311
Yeah, you seemed pretty worked up.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.545
Could you talk about that?

31:29.581 --> 31:31.148
I was just under a lot of stress.

31:31.182 --> 31:32.249
(CHUCKLES)

31:32.283 --> 31:33.450
I mean, if you think it's tough

31:33.485 --> 31:35.005
being a sales rep under Glenn,

31:35.039 --> 31:37.969
you can't imagine what it's
like being his assistant.

31:38.004 --> 31:40.257
It was so much pressure. (CHUCKLES)

31:40.291 --> 31:41.992
He could work you pretty hard, huh?

31:42.026 --> 31:44.428
It wasn't just that.

31:48.765 --> 31:51.602
Susie, you can trust us.

31:51.636 --> 31:53.353
It's better if you tell us everything.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.340
It's just...

31:56.374 --> 31:58.108
I'm not supposed to say.

31:58.143 --> 31:59.693
Uh...

32:00.044 --> 32:02.312
Glenn didn't want me telling anyone.

32:04.482 --> 32:06.183
Well, I don't mean to sound cold, but...

32:07.159 --> 32:09.019
Glenn has passed.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.988
It's okay to talk about it.

32:14.225 --> 32:15.959
Okay.

32:18.296 --> 32:21.465
Glenn would leave the office
a lot in the afternoon.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.600
Yeah, we heard about that.

32:23.635 --> 32:25.035
We checked his calendar,

32:25.069 --> 32:27.097
and he had client meetings
at those times.

32:27.131 --> 32:29.014
No, he didn't.

32:30.056 --> 32:31.642
He just put the appointments in there

32:31.676 --> 32:33.377
so no one would get suspicious.

32:34.102 --> 32:35.946
So what was he doing?

32:37.182 --> 32:39.450
He was undergoing chemo treatment

32:39.484 --> 32:42.019
for, like, the last several months.

32:42.053 --> 32:43.587
Glenn had cancer?

32:48.726 --> 32:50.661
It was so hard lying
to everyone about it.

32:50.695 --> 32:53.363
I-I just wanted to respect his wishes.

32:53.398 --> 32:54.698
He was very sick.

32:54.732 --> 32:56.233
We understand, Susie.

32:56.267 --> 32:57.701
You were just trying to be loyal.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.170
I think, uh,

33:00.205 --> 33:02.639
that's all the questions
we have for today.

33:03.006 --> 33:04.141
Thank you.

33:12.730 --> 33:13.776
Okay.

33:13.810 --> 33:16.520
So there was a mood change
several months ago.

33:16.554 --> 33:17.688
This could be the reason why.

33:17.722 --> 33:20.090
Yeah, I'd be surly, too, if I had cancer

33:20.124 --> 33:21.492
and was undergoing chemo.

33:24.062 --> 33:25.596
Hold on.

33:25.630 --> 33:26.997
Let me, uh...

33:27.405 --> 33:29.032
make a call.

33:30.602 --> 33:32.603
Noelani, it's Magnum.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.238
I have a question for you. If someone

33:34.272 --> 33:37.241
was undergoing chemotherapy
and they took, say,

33:37.275 --> 33:39.576
five times the normal amount
of an antacid,

33:39.611 --> 33:41.011
uh, what would happen?

33:44.449 --> 33:46.350
Okay, thanks.

33:46.384 --> 33:48.785
The combination of chemotherapy
and that much antacid

33:48.820 --> 33:50.474
could cause a heart attack.

33:50.508 --> 33:53.056
So this just went back to being a murder.

33:53.091 --> 33:55.225
Or, at very least, manslaughter.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.527
(SOUND OF DOGS BARKING)

33:58.563 --> 33:59.671
Higgins.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.598
- What'd you find?
- So, the day he died,

34:01.633 --> 34:03.700
Cal went out to get
Glenn's coffee from Island Roast

34:03.735 --> 34:06.069
and bring it back
to the office, as usual.

34:06.737 --> 34:08.272
But on the way back, he was delayed,

34:08.306 --> 34:10.306
because he bumped into
some coworkers in the lobby,

34:10.341 --> 34:12.045
and he had to take the coffee up
to the office kitchen

34:12.079 --> 34:14.578
to warm it up.
And it appears that someone

34:14.612 --> 34:16.659
may have had the opportunity to spike it.

34:16.684 --> 34:17.697
Who?

34:19.666 --> 34:22.452
Jim Peele, uh, from I.T.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.221
He came into the kitchen
while Cal was in there

34:24.255 --> 34:25.789
warming up the coffee, and

34:25.822 --> 34:28.065
from the camera angle
it's hard to tell for sure,

34:28.099 --> 34:29.659
but he's definitely close enough

34:29.694 --> 34:31.094
to have put something in the cup.

34:34.532 --> 34:36.632
Do you think it's possible
Jim used your computer

34:36.668 --> 34:38.393
when you were at your son's play?

34:41.062 --> 34:42.472
Yeah, it is.

34:42.507 --> 34:43.806
I'd been having trouble with my e-mail,

34:43.841 --> 34:45.942
so I asked I.T. to take a look.

34:45.976 --> 34:47.744
Jim never said if he did, but,

34:47.779 --> 34:50.813
as I recall, I stopped having
e-mail issues the next day.

34:50.848 --> 34:52.748
So, maybe on top of fixing your e-mail,

34:52.784 --> 34:56.085
he also took the opportunity
to do some research on poison.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.721
Well, why use my computer for that?

34:57.755 --> 34:59.756
Maybe he wanted another suspect out there

34:59.791 --> 35:01.392
in case people got suspicious of him.

35:01.427 --> 35:04.794
Do you think there's any reason
why Jim would want Glenn dead?

35:07.732 --> 35:09.099
Actually, yes.

35:09.134 --> 35:11.368
(TYPING)

35:11.402 --> 35:12.469
(COMPUTER CHIMES)

35:12.503 --> 35:15.606
Jim probably came across
this e-mail to me from Glenn.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.807
Oh, wow.

35:16.841 --> 35:18.709
Glenn was gonna let Jim go.

35:18.743 --> 35:19.768
If he came across this when he was

35:19.802 --> 35:21.293
on your computer, maybe it set him off,

35:21.328 --> 35:23.347
and he started looking at
ways to get back at Glenn,

35:23.381 --> 35:24.681
including poisoning him.

35:24.716 --> 35:26.850
Yeah, I think we definitely have our guy.

35:26.884 --> 35:28.185
I'll go track him down.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.695
Thanks, Cal. Appreciate it.

35:32.757 --> 35:35.492
I'm gonna call Katsumoto
and then fill in Kahele.

35:35.526 --> 35:37.461
Find Jim. Bring him in for a little chat.

35:37.495 --> 35:38.561
What if he doesn't want to come?

35:38.596 --> 35:40.314
TC, the beauty of having you as a partner

35:40.348 --> 35:42.399
is you're big and intimidating.

35:42.433 --> 35:43.719
He's not gonna say no to you.

35:43.761 --> 35:46.536
All right, I'll be back
in a few minutes with our boy.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.482
Who are those two guys you're talking to?

35:58.516 --> 36:00.584
And don't tell me
they're corporate consultants.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.143
'Cause I know that they're not.

36:13.297 --> 36:15.298

Why is that?

worked for Sun-Smooth.

not to work the case.

That you went out with him

he had been out with,

that he was married.

to tell me anything.

41:48.371 --> 41:50.876
No, I do. I want to be honest with you.

41:54.224 --> 41:56.448
I met him at

41:56.482 --> 41:58.584
one of Robin Masters' charity events.

41:59.578 --> 42:02.614
And I guess I was just...

42:02.639 --> 42:04.240
a bit blind.

42:04.881 --> 42:07.759
It was when I'd just
come to the Island, and...

42:09.715 --> 42:11.616
I was lonely.

42:13.633 --> 42:15.368
Why didn't you say anything?

42:15.635 --> 42:16.768
Because I didn't want to embarrass you.

42:16.803 --> 42:18.070
You didn't tell me,

42:18.104 --> 42:19.771
so I didn't want to make you tell me.

42:22.008 --> 42:23.441
That was kind of you.

42:25.491 --> 42:27.913
Look, you let your guard down, okay?

42:27.947 --> 42:30.916
It's... it's not a big deal.

42:30.950 --> 42:32.325
Thanks.

42:33.820 --> 42:35.275
Does this mean I get to keep the goat?

42:35.310 --> 42:38.523
No, it does not mean that you
get to keep the goat, Magnum.

42:38.558 --> 42:41.093
Why not? There's plenty
of space for a goat.

42:41.127 --> 42:42.828
- Goats are so cute.
- How are you

42:42.862 --> 42:44.506
gonna look after a goat?
You can't look after yourself.

42:44.540 --> 42:46.932
Oh, that's not true. Not entirely true.

42:47.561 --> 42:49.796
- Somewhat true.
- (CHUCKLES)
