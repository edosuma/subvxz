{\an1}Oh, (bleep),

I don't (bleep) know.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.453
{\an1}Okay, bitch, where
are you going? Come here.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.423
I realized I've never opened up
to people before,

22:04.489 --> 22:07.459
so I'm trying to work on...
opening up to my roommates.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.995
(Nilsa)
Hey, girl.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.063
I gotta talk to y'all.

22:11.129 --> 22:12.898
What happened? What, Candace?

22:12.964 --> 22:14.066
No, it's nothing bad.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.867
{\an1}You and Gator
broke up!

22:15.934 --> 22:18.070

22:23.542 --> 22:25.744
Yo, my mama does not approve
of his ass at all,

22:25.811 --> 22:28.146
and honestly, I don't know
if Gator is for me right now,

22:28.213 --> 22:30.849
I really don't, because we
don't know what we doin',

22:30.916 --> 22:32.884

what I'm doing.

22:34.419 --> 22:37.089
It's not easy for me,
but I have to take the time

22:37.155 --> 22:38.490
to really open up
to my roommates,

what to do with... about Gator.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.963
I've never done this
in life, y'all,

22:45.030 --> 22:46.131

doing this by myself,

22:56.374 --> 22:58.643

a lot of emotions in...

23:10.422 --> 23:11.823

23:11.890 --> 23:14.092

being vulnerable.

{\an1}Well, you're opening up
now, girl,

23:15.460 --> 23:16.828

extend to y'all is stronger

y'all and y'all understand me.

23:31.009 --> 23:34.045
{\an1}Exactly.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.881

I've just been misunderstood

23:35.947 --> 23:36.982
throughout this whole thing.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.150
That's all it is.

23:38.216 --> 23:39.518
Well, we understand you
a lot more

23:39.584 --> 23:40.919

up to us, we really do.

Come and put your hands
on Candace.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.723
Lord, I plead
the blood of Jesus

23:44.790 --> 23:46.892
{\an1}that you add your protection
around Candace...

I did not expect everyone
to rally around me

23:49.528 --> 23:51.963
and to be there
for me in this moment,

23:52.030 --> 23:53.999
so I feel really special.

23:54.065 --> 23:55.267

23:56.802 --> 23:59.204
{\an5}She's been there for me,
she's been there
for all of us...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.940
The fact that, like, they
all put their hands over me

24:02.007 --> 24:04.976
and they're praying over me, um,
that really means a lot to me,

24:05.043 --> 24:07.979
and it's definitely one of
my happier moments this summer.

24:08.046 --> 24:09.848

You know, obviously

37:14.765 --> 37:17.234
this has been a very emotional
week for all of us.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.437
At the end of the day,
all these dramatic situations

37:19.503 --> 37:21.238
did bring our whole house
closer together.

37:21.305 --> 37:22.740
I just hope that we can
actually hang out here

37:22.807 --> 37:24.375
without having any drama
from here on out.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.744
{\an6}(Kirk)
Wassup?

37:24.442 --> 37:26.744
(Jeremiah)
Wassup?

37:26.811 --> 37:28.412
It's dark out there.

37:28.479 --> 37:30.314
{\an1}Yeah, it's disgusting
out today.

37:30.381 --> 37:33.250
Dees-gusting.

37:33.317 --> 37:36.020
Plus I was up with Kortni
till, like, 4:00, dude.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.655
What was she so upset for?

37:37.722 --> 37:38.856
{\an1}You can talk to her
about it.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.224
It's personal.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.459
{\an1}(Codi)
Yeah, what happened?

37:41.525 --> 37:43.160
I just went up there
to go check on her

37:43.227 --> 37:44.762
and make sure
everything was okay

37:44.829 --> 37:47.732
and then Aimee and Nilsa
started in on this

37:47.798 --> 37:49.166
and I'm like,
"It's my (bleep) room anyway.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.601
"Y'all in there.

37:50.668 --> 37:53.971
I'm just trying to get
my (bleep) and my pj's on."

37:54.038 --> 37:55.640
(phone ringing)

37:58.676 --> 38:00.277
Beach house.

38:00.344 --> 38:02.747
<i>Hey, is Jeremiah there?</i>
<i>This is his brother Joe.</i>

38:02.813 --> 38:04.682
Okay, hold on one second, okay?

38:07.018 --> 38:09.520
Jeremiah?

38:09.587 --> 38:10.821
Your brother Joe
is on the phone.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.791
{\an4}He is?

38:10.888 --> 38:13.791
{\an1}Yeah.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.559
Let's go...
get our nails done today,

38:15.626 --> 38:16.761
'cause look
at this (bleep).

38:16.827 --> 38:18.062
And then let's go to Fishale.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.330
{\an3}Okay.

38:19.397 --> 38:21.399
{\an1}Maybe Kortni and Candace'll
wanna come.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.268
{\an1}You know Kortni's not gonna
wanna leave the boys.

38:24.335 --> 38:25.469
What's up, bud?

38:25.536 --> 38:26.837
<i>Hey, bud.</i>

38:26.904 --> 38:28.673
<i>Did, uh, did you</i>
<i>get the word already?</i>

38:28.739 --> 38:30.708
About...?

38:30.775 --> 38:33.177
<i>Well, he passed today.</i>

38:33.244 --> 38:36.914
<i>Dad wanted me to call</i>
<i>and let everybody know, um...</i>

38:36.981 --> 38:39.450
<i>He was doing good and, uh...</i>

38:39.517 --> 38:44.555
<i>he was comfortable</i>
<i>before he left, and, uh...</i>

38:44.622 --> 38:45.756
<i>Mom's doing all right.</i>

38:45.823 --> 38:47.491
<i>Grandma's a little broken up.</i>

38:47.558 --> 38:49.593
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
I haven't told anybody
about the fact

38:49.660 --> 38:52.329
that my grandfather's been
going through this rough time,

38:52.396 --> 38:55.499
and the fact that he was
very close to dying.

38:55.566 --> 38:58.869
I thought I would have
a little bit more time but...

38:58.936 --> 39:00.271
no, he's gone.

39:00.337 --> 39:01.972
Well, I knew, I knew it was
gonna happen, it just...

39:02.039 --> 39:03.908
{\an5}(sniffles)

39:02.039 --> 39:03.908
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

39:03.974 --> 39:05.710
So when it happens, you don't
think it's gonna hit so hard.

39:05.776 --> 39:07.645
<i>I know.</i>

39:07.712 --> 39:10.481
<i>He was good for a while though,</i>
<i>that's the good thing.</i>

39:10.548 --> 39:12.149
{\an5}Yeah.

39:10.548 --> 39:12.149
<i>And he went out painlessly.</i>

39:12.216 --> 39:15.486
{\an5}<i>They had him</i>
<i>comfortable, so...</i>

39:12.216 --> 39:15.486
Good.

39:15.553 --> 39:16.687
<i>You all right?</i>

39:16.754 --> 39:18.489
Mm-hmm.
More or less.

39:18.556 --> 39:19.757
<i>Hang in there, all right?</i>

39:19.824 --> 39:21.559
I will.
(sniffles)

39:21.625 --> 39:22.626
<i>All right, I love you, buddy.</i>

39:22.693 --> 39:23.761
I love you too, man.

39:23.828 --> 39:25.329
<i>All right, bye.</i>

39:25.396 --> 39:26.831
Bye.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.543
{\an1}Bro, you okay?
Huh?

39:39.610 --> 39:40.745
Um...

39:40.811 --> 39:43.647
my grandfather just passed.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.416
Oh, Jeremiah.

39:45.483 --> 39:49.186
Dude, I am so sorry, dude.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.322
Hell, I'm so sorry.

39:51.388 --> 39:53.124
{\an3}(gulps)

39:53.190 --> 39:54.625
I am so sorry, Jeremiah.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.260
I know how that is.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.828
I, I didn't share it
with anybody yet,

39:57.895 --> 39:59.930
but he had been struggling
for a little bit, but...

39:59.997 --> 40:00.965
(sniffles)

40:01.031 --> 40:02.133
...it finally hit.

40:02.199 --> 40:04.702
{\an1}God, Jeremiah,
I am so sorry, dude.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.804
He's in a better place.

40:09.406 --> 40:10.574
{\an5}I'm sorry, dude.

40:09.406 --> 40:10.574
(sighs)

40:10.641 --> 40:13.110
{\an1}He's in a better place,
he ain't suffering...

40:13.177 --> 40:14.345
I need to go outside.

40:14.411 --> 40:15.613
{\an1}Yeah.

40:15.679 --> 40:16.947
Hey, Jeremiah, I'm here.

40:17.014 --> 40:18.682
{\an1}If there's anything we can do,
you just let us know.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.952
{\an5}Don't hesitate, okay?
Don't hesitate at all.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.952
I appreciate it.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.690
{\an1}God... you know that I got
