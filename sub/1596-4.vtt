- I'M SORRY, CARL.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.834
- I WANT TO GO TO THE FOREST
AND KILL SOMETHING.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.917
- LET'S FIND YOU
SOMETHING SAFE TO DO,

19:33.917 --> 19:35.250
YET STILL THRILLING,

19:35.250 --> 19:38.542
LIKE MAKING
A TIE-DYED T-SHIRT.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.333
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WANT IT.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.709
DOING THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

19:41.709 --> 19:43.667
IS HOW YOU MAKE
A RELATIONSHIP WORK.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.542
- I CAN'T, FRANK.
I'M SORRY.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.542
SEX TOYS
ARE A GATEWAY CHOICE.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.084
- TOYS CAN BE MIND-EXPANDING.

19:50.084 --> 19:52.709
- I JUST GOT MY ONE-YEAR CHIP
FROM SEX ADDICTS ANONYMOUS.

19:52.709 --> 19:54.667
PART OF MY RECOVERY'S
TO MAKE CERTAIN

19:54.667 --> 19:56.542
THAT I ONLY HAVE
LOVING, COMMITTED SEX.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.000
NO BATTERY-POWERED AIDES
ALLOWED.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.168
- SHE JUST WANTS
TO KICK IT UP A NOTCH.

20:00.168 --> 20:01.458
MAKE HER HAPPY.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.041
- THE KEY
TO MY CONTINUED HAPPINESS

20:03.041 --> 20:05.084
IS TO HAVE LOVING SEX
INFREQUENTLY.

20:05.084 --> 20:06.750
- I'VE MASTERED
THE INFREQUENT PART.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.500
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT
YOUR HAPPINESS.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.001
IT'S ABOUT SHEILA'S.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.083
- I FINALLY GOT MY LIFE
BACK UNDER CONTROL.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.542
IF I KICK IT UP A NOTCH,

20:14.542 --> 20:15.709
THERE'S NO STOPPING ME.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.001
IT'S AN ADDICTION.

20:17.001 --> 20:18.667
- OH, WOULD YOU
STOP BRAGGING?

20:18.667 --> 20:20.959
WE'RE ALL SEX ADDICTS, MAN.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.166
- 10, 12 TIMES A DAY?

20:22.166 --> 20:23.876
- WHAT, THINKING ABOUT IT?
YEAH. MORE.

20:23.876 --> 20:26.209
- NO, THE ACT.
AROUSAL AND RELEASE.

20:26.209 --> 20:27.292
BEFORE I GOT INTO S.A.,

20:27.292 --> 20:29.709
I WAS HAVING SEX
10, 12 TIMES A DAY.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.542
- GIVING OR RECEIVING?

20:31.542 --> 20:33.209
- NEVER RECEIVING.
I WAS DESTROYING.

20:33.209 --> 20:35.083
- DESTROYING?

20:35.083 --> 20:39.126
- THAT'S WHAT I USED TO CALL IT.
"DESTROYING PUSSY."

20:39.126 --> 20:41.542
- YOU ALL MAKE COMING TO WORK
SUCH A DELIGHT.

20:41.542 --> 20:44.125
- 10, 12 TIMES A DAY?
THE SAME WOMAN?

20:44.125 --> 20:46.126
- NEVER. THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT THE INTERNET.

20:46.126 --> 20:47.750
ONCE YOU ANNOUNCE
YOUR DEPRAVITY,

20:47.750 --> 20:49.125
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER
DEPRAVERS SEEKING COMPANY.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.209
I MEAN,
IF YOU PUT IT OUT THERE,

20:51.209 --> 20:52.584
YOU CAN FIND A TON
OF WILLING PARTICIPANTS

20:52.584 --> 20:54.166
WHO WANT TO BE HUMILIATED
HAVING SEX.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.168
- I GOT TO RE-UP
MY AOL ACCOUNT.

20:56.168 --> 20:59.292
- ONE WEEK,
I HAD 32 DIFFERENT PARTNERS.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.792
DIDN'T COST ME A DIME.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.168
TOYS, CONTRAPTIONS,

21:03.168 --> 21:04.625
RESTRAINTS.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.126
YOU KNOW,
YOU START MESSING AROUND,

21:06.126 --> 21:07.417
YOU THINK
YOU'RE UNDER CONTROL,

21:07.417 --> 21:09.750
BUT EVENTUALLY YOU ABUSE
YOUR AROUSAL CENTER,

21:09.750 --> 21:13.292
NEEDING STRANGER AND STRANGER
SHIT TO FLIP YOUR SWITCH.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.168
I MEAN,

21:15.168 --> 21:17.333
I STARTED TO LOOK AT SEX
LIKE A FIGHT,

21:17.333 --> 21:20.001
AND MY WEAPON WAS MY COCK.

21:20.001 --> 21:22.584
I KNEW I REALLY HAD A PROBLEM
WHEN I COULDN'T GET HARD

21:22.584 --> 21:24.083
UNLESS I WAS SLAPPING IT
IN THE FACE

21:24.083 --> 21:27.083
OF A WOMAN WHO WAS PRETENDING
SHE WAS CRYING.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.375
- I UNDERESTIMATED YOU,
JODY.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.750
IN A BAR
FULL OF DEPRAVED PEOPLE,

21:38.750 --> 21:41.250
YOU ARE THE GRAND POOBAH
OF DEPRAVITY.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.292
- WAS.

21:43.292 --> 21:46.001
WON'T BE AGAIN.

21:46.001 --> 21:49.292
WHAT DO I OWE YOU
FOR THE GINGER ALE, KEV?

21:49.292 --> 21:52.126
- VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE?
- MIXED.

21:52.126 --> 21:53.750
YOU GOT ANY RAINBOW SPRINKLES?

21:53.750 --> 21:56.042
- THEY DISCONTINUED
USING SPRINKLES LAST SUMMER.

21:56.042 --> 21:58.292
SOME BRANDS OF FOOD COLORING
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CANCER.

21:58.292 --> 22:01.168
- I ALREADY HAVE CANCER.
THIS CAMP BLOWS.

22:01.168 --> 22:02.959
NO SPRINKLES?
WHAT IS THIS, MEXICO?

22:02.959 --> 22:04.834
- WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE
AN ENJOYABLE--

22:04.834 --> 22:06.542
- CREATE A WAY TO GET SOME
SPRINKLES HERE BEFORE WE DIE.

22:06.542 --> 22:09.168
- HEY, KIDS,
IT'S MOPPY THE CLOWN.

22:09.168 --> 22:13.500
[cheers]

22:13.500 --> 22:15.959
- YO, CARL,
WAY TO SPEAK UP.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.041
- WANT TO GO CHECK OUT
THE LAKE?

22:17.041 --> 22:19.041
- SURE.
I'LL GO ASK.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.584
- DON'T ASK.
JUST GO.

22:20.584 --> 22:21.792
- BUT THEY'LL GET MAD

22:21.792 --> 22:22.876
IF WE DON'T ASK PERMISSION.

22:22.876 --> 22:24.584
- CANCER IS OUR PERMISSION.

22:24.584 --> 22:25.917
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS CAMP

22:25.917 --> 22:27.083
FOR A WHOLE DAY
WITHOUT SEEING THE LAKE.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.667
I'VE NEVER SEEN A LAKE BEFORE.

22:28.667 --> 22:31.876
- NOT EVEN LAKE MICHIGAN?
- WHERE'S THAT?

22:37.250 --> 22:39.168
- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SWING BY THE BANK TODAY,

22:39.168 --> 22:40.500
BUT I'LL GET SOME MONEY
IN THE SQUIRREL FUND TOMORROW.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.250
I PROMISE, OKAY?
- OKAY.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.250
- HOW'D IT GO TODAY?

22:43.250 --> 22:45.250
- WEIRD.
DAY CARE?

22:45.250 --> 22:47.792
- NO KIDS LOST LIMBS.
NO KIDS WERE LOST BY JIM.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.500
- EXCELLENT.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.792
- HOW'D CASHIER WORK
GET WEIRD?

22:51.792 --> 22:53.792
- I THINK EVERYONE AT WORK
OTHER THAN ME

22:53.792 --> 22:55.209
IS BLOWING THE MANAGER.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.625
- THAT'S GENIUS.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.750
EVIL GENIUS.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.709
- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN

22:59.709 --> 23:01.417
WHO CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE THEIR JOBS?

23:01.417 --> 23:03.168
IT'S SICK.
- THEN QUIT.

23:03.168 --> 23:05.917
- I NEED THE JOB.
OVERTIME. BENEFITS.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.292
BUT EVENTUALLY,
THEY'RE ALL GONNA REALIZE

23:08.292 --> 23:10.542
I'M NOT CARRYING
MY SHARE OF THE LOAD.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.750
LITERALLY.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.417
MAYBE I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO MAKE 'EM ALL STOP

23:14.417 --> 23:17.417
BEFORE THEY REALIZE
I'M GETTING A FREE RIDE.

23:17.417 --> 23:19.709
YEAH, IF WE STICK TOGETHER,

23:19.709 --> 23:21.750
COLLECTIVELY BOYCOTT
GIVING HIM WHAT HE WANTS,

23:21.750 --> 23:23.667
MAYBE IT CAN STOP.
THERE'S STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.041
- UNITED WE STAND.
DIVIDED, WE KEEP SUCKING DICK.

23:26.041 --> 23:29.333
- HEY, REVOLUTIONS HAVE BEGUN
WITH LESS INSPIRING PHRASES.

23:29.333 --> 23:31.876
- COOL.

23:31.876 --> 23:34.041
- FLAT ROCKS SKIP BETTER.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.084
THEY PAY FOR YOUR BRACES

23:36.084 --> 23:37.792
BEFORE OR AFTER THEY FOUND OUT
YOU WERE DYING?

23:37.792 --> 23:40.667
- I'M NOT DYING.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.250
- YOU GOT CANCER, DUDE.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.667
YOU'RE DYING.
WE'RE ALL DYING.

23:44.667 --> 23:48.126
- MY DAD GOT ME
SOME SPECIAL PILLS.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.542
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.125
- SERIOUSLY.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.667
- THEY AIN'T GOT NO CURE.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.292
- I THOUGHT THIS CAMP
WAS SUPPOSED TO,

23:57.292 --> 23:59.333
YOU KNOW, LIKE, HELP KIDS,
FRESH AIR AND THAT STUFF.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.333
- THE ONLY KIDS
INVITED TO THIS CAMP

24:01.333 --> 24:02.959
ARE THE ONES
THAT AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT.

24:02.959 --> 24:05.084
THIS IS THE FINAL PARTY.

24:05.084 --> 24:07.667
ONE FINAL "SCREW YOU,"
PUTTING ALL THIS COOL SHIT

24:07.667 --> 24:10.458
WITHIN ARM'S REACH
AND THEN NOT LETTING US DO DICK.

24:10.458 --> 24:11.959
- IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE WISH
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GRANT,

24:11.959 --> 24:14.709
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

24:14.709 --> 24:16.625
- TITTIES.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.625
NEVER SEEN
A REAL GIRL'S TITTIES.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.417
- PORN?
- SURE.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.667
BUT NEVER SEEN TITTIES
IN REAL LIFE.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.625
YOU?
- OLDER SISTER.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.208
- DESCRIBE 'EM.

24:26.208 --> 24:29.792
- LIKE TITTIES, EXCEPT THEIR
YOUR OLDER SISTER'S.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.083
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO KEEP LOOKING AT 'EM.

24:34.917 --> 24:36.375
[bed screeching]

24:36.375 --> 24:37.750
- HOW'S THAT?

24:37.750 --> 24:40.166
- FINE.

24:40.166 --> 24:42.458
- YOU FEELING ME?
- OH, I DO.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.125
- WHAT'S MY NAME?

24:44.125 --> 24:45.292
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
YOUR NAME?

24:45.292 --> 24:47.041
- SAY IT!
- IT.

24:47.041 --> 24:48.917
- MY NAME.
- JODY.

24:48.917 --> 24:53.709
- [groans]

24:53.709 --> 24:57.209
[car horn blares]

25:20.125 --> 25:22.834
[knock at door]

25:25.292 --> 25:28.292
- HEY, MOLLY.
IT'S ME, MANDY.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.667
WHOA.
UH, THIS IS LIP,

25:33.667 --> 25:35.792
MY FRIEND.
- HEY.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.959
- IS DADDY HERE?

25:37.959 --> 25:42.709
- HE'S AT SEA,
BUT HE SENDS HIS LOVE.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.166
HOW ARE YOU?

25:44.166 --> 25:46.083
- AM I COMING HOME
WITH YOU?

25:48.667 --> 25:51.083
- UM, MOLLY, DID YOUR MOM--
DID SHE HAVE, LIKE,

25:51.083 --> 25:53.375
AN ADDRESS BOOK
WITH FAMILY MEMBERS

25:53.375 --> 25:54.500
FROM HER SIDE
OF THE FAMILY?

25:54.500 --> 25:56.667
COUSINS
OR ANYONE LIKE THAT?

25:56.667 --> 25:59.168
- NO.

25:59.168 --> 26:01.250
- OKAY,
WHAT ABOUT HER CELL PHONE?

26:01.250 --> 26:03.083
ANYONE ON THAT?

26:03.083 --> 26:05.417
- SHE ONLY HAD
TWO NUMBERS ON IT.

26:05.417 --> 26:08.208
DADDY'S AND HER DEALER'S.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.625
- YOU NEVER MET
ANY UNCLES OR AUNTIES?

26:10.625 --> 26:13.625
- JUST YOU
AND MY COUSIN DAVID.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.750
HE'S IN THE NAVY
AND FIGHTS BAD GUYS.

26:15.750 --> 26:19.542
BUT OTHER THAN HIM, NO.

26:19.542 --> 26:22.000
ARE YOU TAKING ME
TO DADDY?

26:45.292 --> 26:47.041
- OOH, 51 SECONDS, DEBS.

26:47.041 --> 26:49.709
- ONLY 39 SECONDS TO GO.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.750
[inhales deeply]

26:55.125 --> 26:57.750
- HEY, REGISTER TWO.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.792
YOU HAVING A PARTY?

26:59.792 --> 27:01.292
THE LADIES'LL BE
ALL A-FLITTER.

27:01.292 --> 27:02.792
HI.
PATTY.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.584
DELI.
- HEY, PATTY. FIONA.

27:04.584 --> 27:07.083
YEAH, JUST A CHANCE
TO MINGLE AWAY FROM WORK.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.041
COFFEE, COCKTAILS,
CONVERSATION.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.917
TOTALLY CASUAL.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.458
- I'VE BEEN WORKING HERE
25 YEARS.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.084
NO ONE'S EVER
THROWN A PARTY.

27:14.084 --> 27:15.750
- WELL, IT'S GOOD TO GET
TO KNOW PEOPLE

27:15.750 --> 27:17.625
AWAY FROM THE SALT MINE,
YOU KNOW?

27:17.625 --> 27:19.917
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GLAD
YOU'RE GONNA SHOW US.

27:19.917 --> 27:21.292
WANT ME TO BRING SOMETHING?

27:21.292 --> 27:23.084
- WE'RE ALL SET.
- ARE YOU SURE?

27:23.084 --> 27:24.250
SOMETHING FROM THE DELI?

27:24.250 --> 27:26.042
BOBBY'D PROBABLY GIVE US
A DISCOUNT.

27:26.042 --> 27:27.125
OR I COULD THROW AWAY
SOME MEAT

27:27.125 --> 27:28.667
AND PICK IT UP
FROM THE DUMPSTER LATER.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.834
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL DOUBLE-BAG IT.

27:30.834 --> 27:34.125
- I'M JUST GONNA DO CHIPS
AND SALSA, SOMETHING LIGHT.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.125
- WELL, MORE ROOM
IN MY BELLY FOR BEER.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.625
- SEE YOU TONIGHT.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.959
- PANERAI.
NICE.

27:44.959 --> 27:46.917
- HOW NICE?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.041
- $2,000.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.876
- THAT COST ME FIVE
THREE YEARS AGO.

27:52.876 --> 27:55.667
- DON'T NEED A PEDIGREE.
JUST NEED AN ANSWER.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.458
- [clicks tongue]

28:00.917 --> 28:03.292
[cell phone ringing]

28:05.375 --> 28:07.250
FUCK.

28:10.500 --> 28:13.000
- OKAY, KIDS, FOR LUNCH,
WE HAVE ORGANIC CHICKEN,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.042
A FRESH KALE SALAD,

28:15.042 --> 28:17.209
AND A JUICE BAR
WITH BEETS AND CUKES

28:17.209 --> 28:18.458
AND GINGER AND CARROTS
READY TO BE GROUND DOWN

28:18.458 --> 28:20.041
INTO THEIR ESSENTIAL GOODNESS.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.208
- GOT ANY CHICKEN NUGGETS?
- I LOVE CHICKEN NUGGETS.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.041
- CHICKIE NUGS?
I WANT SOME.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.084
- SORRY, GUYS.
NO CHICKEN NUGGETS.

28:26.084 --> 28:27.333
- GOT A CAR?
- NO.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.000
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT.
- BUY ONE.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.876
PEOPLE WHO GO TO COLLEGE
ARE RICH.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.208
- I'M NOT.
- THEN GO CALL US A CAB

28:33.208 --> 28:34.542
AND GO GET US
SOME NUGGETS.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.000
- I GOT MONEY.
MY MOM SAID I COULD BUY

28:36.000 --> 28:37.625
WHATEVER I WANT
FROM THE CAMP STORE.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.208
I WANT CHICKEN NUGGETS.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.917
- THERE'S NO NUGGETS
AT THE CAMP STORE.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.959
- WE'RE DYING OF CANCER.

28:42.959 --> 28:46.000
SERIAL KILLERS ON DEATH ROW GET
LOBSTER FOR THEIR FINAL MEAL.

IF YOU AND I CAN HAVE
A LITTLE TOY TIME ON THE SIDE.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.834

29:47.834 --> 29:50.041
BUT NOT AS SPECIAL
AS YOU AND JODY.

BY ALLOWING ME
TO MAKE YOU FEEL SOMETHING

30:04.168 --> 30:08.041
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO FEEL.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.001
[dog barking]

30:11.001 --> 30:12.001

TO MY HOUSE

30:12.001 --> 30:13.041
WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST?

30:13.041 --> 30:14.667
- YOU TOOK ME IN
WHEN I NEEDED IT.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.084
- MY M.S. HAS GOT REAL BAD.

I'M SORRY.

30:28.001 --> 30:31.084
- NO, IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA,
MANDY.

30:31.084 --> 30:32.375
IT'S A BAD TIME.

OF LITTLE KIDS.

THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE
WHO WORK

30:38.750 --> 30:40.375
IN THE PLACES
THAT TAKE CARE OF ORPHANS.

30:40.375 --> 30:42.208
SHE'LL BE BETTER OFF.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.417
- COULD YOU LOOK AFTER HER
WHILE WE FIGURE IT OUT?

30:46.001 --> 30:47.375
WHEN THERE'S NO AUNT RANDE
TO RUN TO?

30:47.375 --> 30:50.584

THERE WON'T BE.

THE BARBARIC ROOTS
OF THE SEXUAL ACT.

31:04.959 --> 31:08.709
DON'T LOSE TOUCH WITH THE SEEDS
OF OUR ANIMAL NATURE.

31:08.709 --> 31:10.500
- THAT'S A GOOD THING.
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.250
WE'RE PEOPLE
WITH THE ABILITY

31:12.250 --> 31:14.709
TO ELEVATE SEX TO A SPIRITUAL,
LOVING EXPERIENCE.

31:14.709 --> 31:16.750
- YOU CAN HAVE THAT
WITH SHEILA

31:16.750 --> 31:18.166
AND STILL GIVE HER
WHAT SHE NEEDS.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.292
- THAT'S NOT BEEN
MY EXPERIENCE.

31:19.292 --> 31:21.001

LET PAST REGRETS

31:30.542 --> 31:33.083
SCARE YOU FROM EMBRACING
NEW EXPERIENCES.

31:33.083 --> 31:36.209
- IT'S WHAT IT UNLEASHES IN ME
THAT I'M AFRAID OF.

31:36.209 --> 31:38.876
- JODY, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF YOUR RECOVERY

31:38.876 --> 31:41.084
IS THIS LITTLE FAMILY
YOU'VE STARTED.

31:41.084 --> 31:43.125
SHEILA WANTS TO BE SENSITIVE
TO YOUR RECOVERY,

31:43.125 --> 31:44.292
BUT SHE HAS NEEDS.

31:44.292 --> 31:46.333
YOUR ACCEPTANCE
OF THOSE NEEDS

31:46.333 --> 31:48.000
IS AN ACT OF LOVE.

- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE HER
TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.126
- WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE HER
TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE

33:05.126 --> 33:07.084
BECAUSE HER FATHER LIKES
TO MOLEST HIS DAUGHTERS.

[laughter]

37:35.542 --> 37:37.208
GIVE HIM SOMETHING
TO SCREAM ABOUT.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.041
- AMEN, JENNICA!
[laughter continues]

37:40.041 --> 37:43.083
- WE'RE PLAYING
A DANGEROUS GAME, LADIES.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.041
OKAY?
WAIT, WAIT.

37:45.041 --> 37:47.084
IF WE CAUSE A RUCKUS,
WE GET HIM FIRED,

37:47.084 --> 37:48.542
GUESS WHAT?

37:48.542 --> 37:50.792
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
THE NEXT MANAGER WILL BE.

37:50.792 --> 37:52.292
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T LET US
CALL IN SICK

37:52.292 --> 37:54.375
WHEN WE'RE REALLY NOT SICK?

37:54.375 --> 37:56.333
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T LET US
GO TO A FUNERAL

37:56.333 --> 37:57.375
WITHOUT PUNCHING OUT?

37:57.375 --> 37:59.001
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T LET US

37:59.001 --> 38:01.209
TAKE HOME EXPIRED MEAT
AND SHEET CAKES

38:01.209 --> 38:04.084
AND A PONY KEG
ONCE AND AGAIN FOR FREE?

38:04.084 --> 38:05.417
BOBBY'S A NICE GUY.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.042
OKAY, OKAY,
SO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE HIM

38:08.042 --> 38:09.709
WITH ORAL PLEASURE
ONCE A WEEK.

38:09.709 --> 38:11.876
IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING?
all: YES!

38:11.876 --> 38:14.917
- NO, NO, NO,
LISTEN, GIRLS, LISTEN.

38:14.917 --> 38:18.166
THE DICK WE'RE SUCKING
MAY VERY WELL BE BETTER

38:18.166 --> 38:21.458
THAN THE DICK WE MIGHT HAVE
TO SUCK INSTEAD.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.208
- THANK GOD
YOU'RE IN THE MINORITY.

38:23.208 --> 38:24.876
all: YEAH.

38:24.876 --> 38:27.000
- UH, YEAH?
all: YEAH.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.417
- LET'S TAKE A VOTE.

38:28.417 --> 38:30.125
- ON WHAT?

38:30.125 --> 38:32.084
- THE SITUATION AT HAND.

38:32.084 --> 38:35.333
WHETHER WE KEEP
WHAT'S WORKING WORKING.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.750
- YOU WANT
TO HAVE A VOTE?

38:37.750 --> 38:41.458
- HEY, YOU CONVENED
THE BLOW JOB TOWN HALL.

38:41.458 --> 38:44.500
LET'S VOTE.
YES OR NO.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.041
- FINE.

38:47.041 --> 38:48.458
SHOW OF HANDS.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.458
- NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.959
SECRET BALLOT.

38:51.959 --> 38:55.168
LET THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
UNFOLD.

38:58.458 --> 39:00.250
- COUPLE OF TIPS:

39:00.250 --> 39:02.667
DON'T RELAX.
PRETEND YOU'RE SCARED.

39:02.667 --> 39:05.083
SHE LIKES THAT.

39:05.083 --> 39:06.375
- I DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND, THOUGH.

39:06.375 --> 39:09.042
- IT'LL STRETCH.
TRUST ME.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.126
IF GOD DIDN'T WANT US
PUTTING THINGS UP OUR ASS,

39:11.126 --> 39:13.792
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE RECTUM
A GAG REFLEX.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.166
[laughter]

39:17.292 --> 39:19.500
- SO I WAS THINKING
TONIGHT MAYBE YOU AND MOLLY

39:19.500 --> 39:20.917
SHOULD SLEEP TOGETHER.

39:20.917 --> 39:22.208
I'LL JUST BUNK
WITH IAN AND LIAM.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.625
THAT WAY, IF SHE WAKES UP
IN THE MIDDLE

39:23.625 --> 39:24.834
OF THE NIGHT
AND SHE'S FREAKING OUT,

39:24.834 --> 39:27.834
YOU'LL BE THERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

39:29.417 --> 39:32.500
- HOW LONG?

39:32.500 --> 39:34.083
- 92 SECONDS!

39:34.083 --> 39:37.084
- WHOO!
[cheers]

39:43.000 --> 39:44.876
- I'M ONLY DOING THIS
FOR HANLEY.

39:44.876 --> 39:46.084
- I HAVE CANCER TOO.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.042
- ME TOO.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.625
- YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND
I'VE EVER HAD.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
- [sighs]

40:13.792 --> 40:16.375
[sighs]

40:16.375 --> 40:18.126
- NOW HOW ABOUT
THE LOWER HALF?

40:18.126 --> 40:20.792
- NOT HAPPENING, PAL.

40:20.792 --> 40:22.084
- WENDY?

40:22.084 --> 40:23.166
- WOW.

40:23.166 --> 40:26.041
EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED THEM
TO BE.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.083
- OKAY.

40:34.083 --> 40:37.917
BLOW JOB.

40:37.917 --> 40:40.292
NO BLOW JOB.

40:40.292 --> 40:42.792
BLOW JOB.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.292
ABSTENTION?

40:44.292 --> 40:46.542
REALLY, LADIES?
ONE OF YOU IS ABSTAINING?

40:46.542 --> 40:47.917
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:47.917 --> 40:49.166
- IT MEANS SOMEONE
DOESN'T CARE

40:49.166 --> 40:50.959
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

40:50.959 --> 40:54.083
- I NEVER MINDED IT,
BUT HE NEVER ASKS ME ANYMORE.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.709
- THAT'S CAUSE YOU'RE
A HUMAN PIRANHA, LOIS.

40:55.709 --> 40:58.083
- AND BLOW JOBS WIN,
SIX TO THREE.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.333
- WITH ONE ABSTENTION.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.834
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

41:00.834 --> 41:01.917
- I WANT A RECOUNT.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.625
- YEAH, COME ON, LADIES.

41:03.625 --> 41:06.417
- HOW COULD THIS MANY OF YOU
VOTE FOR BLOW JOBS?

41:06.417 --> 41:07.917
- YEAH, HAVE THE GUTS
TO SAY WHO YOU ARE.

41:07.917 --> 41:10.250
- PATTY'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.500
- LUCY, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR BLOUSE?

41:11.500 --> 41:14.083
- OH, THE STAIN CAME OUT.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.876
- ADMIT IT, FIONA.
HE DOESN'T TASTE THAT BAD.

41:15.876 --> 41:20.667
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER DONE IT.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.168
- YOU'RE THE REASON
WHY I HAD

41:22.168 --> 41:23.917
TO PICK UP AN EXTRA HUMMER
THIS WEEK?

41:26.125 --> 41:28.126
- POP.

41:28.126 --> 41:29.584
- JAMES.

41:29.584 --> 41:33.168
UM...

41:33.168 --> 41:34.959
IS THIS A PLACE
YOU FREQUENT?

41:34.959 --> 41:36.500
- YEAH, NEIGHBORHOOD JOINT.
WHAT'S UP?

41:36.500 --> 41:38.959
- OH.

41:38.959 --> 41:40.917
UM...

41:40.917 --> 41:43.083
YOUR MOTHER AND I

41:43.083 --> 41:45.834
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

41:45.834 --> 41:47.208
- KEV, SHOTS, PLEASE.

41:47.208 --> 41:50.000
- OKAY, I'LL JUST BE
DOWN THE HALL.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.292
YOU MAY HEAR SOME SIRENS
AND STUFF DURING THE NIGHT,

41:52.292 --> 41:55.375
BUT YOU'LL BE SAFE.

41:55.375 --> 41:56.834
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.

41:56.834 --> 41:58.917
- GOOD NIGHT.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.333
- HERE YOU GO.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.876
CHANGE OF UNDERWEAR
AND A NIGHTGOWN.

42:01.876 --> 42:05.333
- I'LL BE BACK
IN A SECOND, MOLLY.

42:05.333 --> 42:07.000
THANKS.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.667
- OH, YEAH.
NO WORRIES.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.458
NIGHT.

42:19.458 --> 42:21.876
- NIGHT.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.126
- I WILL TOTALLY TEACH YOU
TO SWIM.

42:37.126 --> 42:39.292
WE COULD PROTECT ONE OTHER
FROM CITY KIDS

42:39.292 --> 42:40.876
WHO HATE WHITE PEOPLE.

42:46.209 --> 42:49.083
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S JUST MY GIRL PENIS.

42:49.083 --> 42:54.417
- IT LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE A BOY PENIS.

42:54.417 --> 42:56.542
- BUT I'M A GIRL,

42:56.542 --> 42:59.584
SO IT'S DIFFERENT.

43:07.084 --> 43:10.333
- THE INCOMPATIBILITY
FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO US.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.959
- WHEN YOU MOVING OUT?

43:11.959 --> 43:14.041
- NOW, BASICALLY.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.959

43:15.959 --> 43:19.208
- WELL, LITERALLY.

43:19.208 --> 43:21.208
SHE, UH...

43:21.208 --> 43:24.084
SHE CHANGED THE LOCKS.

43:24.084 --> 43:26.250
- HMM.

43:26.250 --> 43:27.750
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

43:27.750 --> 43:31.917
- A HOTEL PROBABLY.

43:31.917 --> 43:34.917
- SO HOW'S MOM?

43:34.917 --> 43:37.542
- WELL...

43:37.542 --> 43:39.041
SHE'S FINE.

43:41.667 --> 43:44.792
AH.
I'M BEING NICE.

43:44.792 --> 43:45.792
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

43:45.792 --> 43:47.500
YOUR MOTHER,

43:47.500 --> 43:50.667
SHE IS ON THE FINAL SLOPE
DOWNWARD

43:50.667 --> 43:53.166

43:53.166 --> 43:55.959
A PILL TO RISE,
A PILL TO SLEEP,

43:55.959 --> 43:59.166
A PILL TO NUMB HER
THROUGHOUT THE DAY,

43:59.166 --> 44:03.000
AND THEN TANQUERAY
TO WASH IT ALL DOWN.

44:06.876 --> 44:11.208
SHE CHANGED THE LOCKS.

44:11.208 --> 44:13.208
SO BE IT.

44:18.042 --> 44:19.542
- AND REMEMBER TO BREATHE.

44:19.542 --> 44:20.876

44:20.876 --> 44:23.000
