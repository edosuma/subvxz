WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:09.835
MAN [over radio]: I got another
one for you, Road Hog.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
Come back.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.100
Road Hog here.
Lay it on me, Lobo.

00:13.143 --> 00:16.103
Jennifer Aniston,
or Jennifer Lopez?

00:16.146 --> 00:17.843
Man, that's a tough one.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.280
Both way out of my league.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.716
Hey, who would I be?

00:20.759 --> 00:22.457
What do mean, who'd you be?
They'd be them,

00:22.500 --> 00:23.893
you'd be you.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.113
Yeah, but I mean,
couldn't I be Tom Cruise

00:26.156 --> 00:28.071
or that Wolverine guy
or somebody?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.029
That ain't how this works, Hog.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.205
What the hell...?

00:31.248 --> 00:36.297
[brakes and tires screeching,
horn blowing]

00:37.689 --> 00:41.476
Oh, man. Oh, please no.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.695
No, no, no. Oh.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.306
[panting]

00:45.349 --> 00:48.961
Hey, you okay?
[grunting]

00:49.005 --> 00:51.051
Mister, where'd
you come from?

00:53.357 --> 00:56.273
God does protect drunks
and fools, I guess.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.971
Let me call the cops, okay?

00:59.015 --> 01:00.712
Need some water or something?

01:00.756 --> 01:03.280
[guttural gasping]

01:03.324 --> 01:05.065
[groaning]

01:05.108 --> 01:06.762
Mister?

01:06.805 --> 01:09.373
[guttural gasping]

01:42.058 --> 01:43.190
[elevator bell dings]

01:45.322 --> 01:47.281
[groans]

01:47.324 --> 01:49.021
You know it's too early

01:49.065 --> 01:51.285
when there's no one
even here to make coffee.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.069
Does that mean
you made some?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.245
Oh, yeah, and I made
some nice muffins, too.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.204
Get 'em while
they're piping hot.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.162
I should have stopped
on the way in.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.164
Who had the time?

02:01.208 --> 02:04.254
We all got the pre-dawn
wake-up call after

02:04.298 --> 02:05.734
a 2:00 a.m. night, no less.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.039
Anyone know what's up?

02:07.083 --> 02:08.650
Oh, hey, Timmy.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.609
Yeah, Gibbs wants to get a jump
on Jimmy's bridal registry.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.263
Ziva's thinking
his-and-her salad tongs.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.525
ZIVA:
At the moment,

02:14.569 --> 02:16.310
I can think
of nothing but coffee.

02:16.353 --> 02:19.182
Ask and ye shall receive.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.618
Oh, Ducky, you are

02:20.662 --> 02:22.577
my hero.
Yeah, that's me.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.275
The Sir Galahad of
caffeinated beverages.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.581
Thanks, Ducky.

02:26.624 --> 02:27.625
DUCKY:
It's not every morning

02:27.669 --> 02:28.713
that we receive

02:28.757 --> 02:30.280
the same mysterious
invitation.

02:30.324 --> 02:33.283
Who amongst us
knows what awaits?

02:33.327 --> 02:35.024
Well, rise and shine,
dear friends.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.330
[laughs]

02:36.373 --> 02:37.635
What the hell was that about?

02:37.679 --> 02:40.203
That, my friend,
was a very sweet gesture.

02:40.247 --> 02:43.119
Ducky has been
pretty chipper lately.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.860
Old Penelope must be

02:44.903 --> 02:46.078
quite the hellcat.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.384
Hey, leave my grandmother
out of this.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.560
She and Ducky went on one date.
That was it.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.214
[laughs]

02:51.258 --> 02:53.869
Clearly, McGullible,
they are sparing you the

02:53.912 --> 02:57.351
horrid, torrid details
of their racy affair.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.874
I do not know
about that.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.137
My sources say that Ducky
does have a special lady friend,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.921
but, uh, she is

03:02.965 --> 03:05.097
a woman that he met on-line
a few weeks ago.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.230
Her name's Mary,
and according to my sources,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.666
Ducky is over the moon.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.885
Ooh.
Wait.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.278
Back the truck up.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.236
Who are these sources?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.846
Mine haven't said anything.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.283
Perhaps you do not
have sources.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.241
Or your sources are lousy.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.112
Uh, exsqueeze me, guys.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.375
Very Special Agent here.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.899
I got sold gold sources
coming out the yang.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.117
ZIVA:
I do not know

03:25.161 --> 03:28.208
what or where your yang is,

03:28.251 --> 03:32.168
but perhaps your sources do not
trust you with internal gossip.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
Nobody keeps a secret like me.

03:33.778 --> 03:37.042
Then if your sources
are reliable,

03:37.086 --> 03:39.480
then perhaps
we should compare notes.

03:39.523 --> 03:43.135
Bring it, David.
Mum's the word.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.267
I got three for you, DiNozzo.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.748
Reservist
versus semi.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.010
Let me guess who won.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.446
Accident, boss?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.622
Yeah. Hoping.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.798
Let's go.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.278
Who are these little birds

03:55.322 --> 03:58.368
that told you
of my personal affair?

03:58.412 --> 04:00.762
Well, I can't divulge
my sources, Ducky,

04:00.805 --> 04:03.286
but, of course, one of them was
of the Israeli

04:03.330 --> 04:04.548
parrot variety.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.158
So much for trusting you.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.117
You did not even
last 30 minutes.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.380
Last? Wait a second.
What are we talking about?

04:10.424 --> 04:12.556
ZIVA:
All we've heard, Ducky,

04:12.600 --> 04:16.038
is that you met a woman on-line
and that her name is Mary.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.866
Dr. Mary Courtney.

04:17.909 --> 04:20.303
She's chief administrator
of a whole host

04:20.347 --> 04:22.262
of social service programs
throughout DC.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.352
JIMMY: There's a dating Web site
dedicated to every demographic.

04:25.395 --> 04:28.311
Doctors, dancers,
Civil War reenactors.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.227
Uh, ScholarDate is
dedicated to, um...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.142
Eggheads.
Big brains.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.275
Smart people.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.580
It's how I met Breena.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.930
Seems to have scored for
Dr. Mallard, as well.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.672
ZIVA: I did not take you for the
computer dating type, Ducky.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.500
Well, I was dubious
at first, but after

04:43.544 --> 04:46.895
a whirlwind of computer chats,
phone conversations,

04:46.938 --> 04:49.332
and three delightful luncheons,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.116
it's dinner
at her place tonight.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.555
She's making
her world-famous paella.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.731
Ugh! Paella.

04:56.774 --> 05:01.126
Named, of course, for Paellas
the Aztec god of sex after 60.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.171
GIBBS:
DiNozzo?

05:02.214 --> 05:03.172
Mm.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.782
Sorry, boss.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.610
Thanks.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.004
[camera shutter clicks]

05:09.047 --> 05:10.701
Victim's a Naval reservist.

05:10.745 --> 05:14.270
Lieutenant Jason Simms,
44, from Fairfax.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.402
Witnesses say
he was swerving

05:15.445 --> 05:17.360
all over the road,
clearly drunk.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
Pulled off onto the shoulder
over there.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.668
You got a time?

05:20.711 --> 05:22.365
A little over
three hours ago.
DUCKY:
Tony?

05:24.411 --> 05:26.195
4:19, to be precise.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.937
The truck tapped his wrist,
apparently.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.155
Being drunk is one thing,

05:30.199 --> 05:31.722
but why would he have crossed
the road?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.245
Suppressing chicken joke

05:33.289 --> 05:34.508
in three, two...
Cell phone?

05:34.551 --> 05:35.639
McGEE:
MIA.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.293
Not on him,
or in his car.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.078
Well, then,
that's where he was headed.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.220
The lieutenant
was in trouble.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.222
Adhesive on
both his wrists.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.093
Was he bound?

05:55.137 --> 05:57.444
Unless he had a cocktail
taped to each hand,

05:57.487 --> 06:01.361
I'd say there's a great deal
more here than meets the eye.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.456
What do you got, Duck?

06:09.499 --> 06:10.718
Chasing a hunch.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.154
The victim's dermis

06:12.197 --> 06:14.069
is oddly loose for a man

06:14.112 --> 06:15.287
of his musculature.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.941
ABBY: Hey, Gibbs,
so the tox results

06:16.985 --> 06:19.074
are gonna take
awhile, but get this.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.164
This guy's blood alcohol level
was only point-zero-five.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.427
Not drunk.Not legally.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.299
And certainly not as plowed
as the witnesses said he was.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.475
GIBBS:
He diabetic?

06:28.518 --> 06:29.867
I wondered that myself,

06:29.911 --> 06:31.913
because diabetics
can seem drunk

06:31.956 --> 06:33.218
if their numbers
are all wacky,

06:33.262 --> 06:34.481
but his blood sugar
is normal, too.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.396
So, why take
on a highway?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.096
Ah, as I thought.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.445
Water intoxication.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.316
Drunk on water?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.145
Yeah, 1,960 grams.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.191
Whoa, that is, like,
a pound too heavy.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.454
DUCKY:
Well, that would explain
the skin texture.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.282
Hey, look, there's
the excess accumulation

06:53.325 --> 06:55.284
in the extracellular spaces
of his brain.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.286
Hmm.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.461
See here, Jethro.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.768
No. No, I believe you, Duck.

07:00.811 --> 07:04.075
Brain cells can't keep up
with large volumes of water

07:04.119 --> 07:06.164
consumed over a short period
of time.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.471
They lose their ability
to absorb...

07:08.515 --> 07:10.386
Duck, that make him seem loaded?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.475
Well, seeming
intoxicated was the least

07:12.519 --> 07:14.259
of his problems, Jethro.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.479
Well, prior to his
near-miss with the truck,

07:16.523 --> 07:19.743
our lieutenant here
was well on the way

07:19.787 --> 07:21.789
to drowning in his own skin.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.279
Yeah. Listen, I got to go.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.107
Hey there, Jenn.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.850
You know, you are doing
a great job.

07:39.894 --> 07:43.724
Keep it up, you'll be
a special agent in no time.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.031
Little young, Tony.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.598
[laughs]

07:48.642 --> 07:51.514
Ease up, Nanny McFeeble.
I'm just giving the kid

07:51.558 --> 07:52.950
a little vote of confidence.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.604
Yeah, McGee.
If Tony was flirting,

07:54.648 --> 07:57.172
he would be complimenting her
blouse and not her work ethic.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.521
See? Ziva knows.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.827
ZIVA:
What we just witnessed

07:59.870 --> 08:02.264
here was, um, a pathetic attempt

08:02.307 --> 08:04.527
to cultivate new sources
for office gossip.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.311
That is completely unfair.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.399
GIBBS:
Life isn't fair,

08:07.443 --> 08:09.445
DiNozzo. That's why
we're here. Go.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.970
Lieutenant Jason Simms,
served in the first Gulf War,

08:13.014 --> 08:14.929
Naval Reservist since '02.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.453
Divorced, two kids.
Currently owns

08:17.497 --> 08:19.760
a mailbox franchise
in West Springfield.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.152
According to his employees,

08:21.196 --> 08:23.590
Simms left work
at about 6:30 last night,

08:23.633 --> 08:25.374
after having an argument
with his ex-wife by cell phone.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.549
Records?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.290
There were two calls
to his ex,

08:28.333 --> 08:29.247
actually, 15 minutes apart.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.988
Last calls he made.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.337
Credit cards?McGEE:
No unusual hits,

08:32.381 --> 08:34.470
but I'm checking
for earlier activity.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.211
Given the duct tape
and the cause of death,

08:36.254 --> 08:38.387
is it possible the lieutenant
was waterboarded?

08:38.430 --> 08:39.388
Ducky said that close
to four gallons

08:39.431 --> 08:40.432
were poured down his throat.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.391
Yeah, but where?
We do not even know

08:42.434 --> 08:44.219
where he was
driving from.
McGee?

08:44.262 --> 08:46.090
There's no nav system
in his SUV.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.614
I got a skeleton
in his closet.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.094
Look at this.
Just found an old police report

08:50.138 --> 08:53.184
involving Simms and this
guy, Phillip Ekkerly.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.925
Works at a gun shop in Burke.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.319
Police responded to a fight
between the two last month,

08:57.362 --> 08:59.582
but no charges were
filed on either side.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.976
DiNozzo, get that guy in here.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.023
DUCKY:
You missed something,
Mr. Palmer.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.417
In the area
of the lambdoid suture.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.462
Not enough mint jelly?

09:10.506 --> 09:11.594
[laughs]

09:11.638 --> 09:13.553
Lambdoid?

09:13.596 --> 09:15.206
Um... [clears throat]

09:15.250 --> 09:17.165
That's right where his head
hit the pavement, isn't it?

09:17.208 --> 09:21.343
It's void of
asphalt particulates.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.171
And this hematoma
is deeper in color.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.389
Meaning?

09:24.433 --> 09:26.696
Likely incurred
before the truck hit him.

09:26.740 --> 09:30.482

Hello, Mary.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.319

Yes, I suppose
I could sneak out.

I would share them with you.

I have to rush off.

Right.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.904
Pain in my butt
is what he was.

Which is why
you don't seem too upset

11:29.514 --> 11:30.951

wrong, it's a shock, but...

11:38.610 --> 11:39.873
What money?

11:39.916 --> 11:41.396
Is that what your fight
was about last month?

11:41.439 --> 11:44.486
Guy owed me 500 bucks
for a mailbox

11:44.529 --> 11:45.792
I was keeping
at his place.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.143
He owed you for
your mailbox?

11:49.186 --> 11:52.059
I was taking
my business elsewhere

11:52.102 --> 11:53.800
and then he kept
my deposit,

11:53.843 --> 11:57.368
claiming I had never paid
my bill, which I had.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.587
So you went after him.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.806
Other way around.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.633
I was content to let
small claims handle it.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.461
He was the one who thought
he could scare me

12:03.505 --> 12:05.812
with this macho
military crap.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.944
So you duked it out,
the cops showed up,

12:07.988 --> 12:10.164
but nobody pressed charges?

12:10.207 --> 12:11.469
[sighs]

12:11.513 --> 12:13.080
What can I tell you?

12:13.123 --> 12:14.255
I felt for the guy.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.910
I mean, business is bad.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.389
He's always worried
about losing his kids.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.869
I just figured

12:19.913 --> 12:23.525
we'd let the dust settle
and I'd see my money eventually.

12:23.568 --> 12:27.747
Hmm, and when did
you last see him?

12:27.790 --> 12:30.488
Well, that day that we fought.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.577
Why, what happened
to him, anyway?

12:32.621 --> 12:35.667
Need to know
where you were last night.

they'll tell you.

the head wound?

Any thoughts on Mary?
Come on, spill it, Jimmy.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.028
What's she like?
Is she pretty?

12:48.071 --> 12:49.420
What's Ducky like
when he's with her?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.683
Well, I haven't met her yet,
but she sounds amazing,

12:51.727 --> 12:53.337
and Dr. Mallard
still hasn't returned

12:53.381 --> 12:54.948
since she invited him
out to...

12:54.991 --> 12:57.515
Oh, but I have returned,
Mr. Palmer,

stomach contents

to deliver

was just, uh...

13:04.827 --> 13:06.220
just so I could
have you come visit.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.221
Yeah, and to answer
your question,

13:07.264 --> 13:09.266
Mary is smart,

13:09.310 --> 13:11.703
very attractive,
and I am quite smitten.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.619
She also has
excellent taste in pastries,

13:14.663 --> 13:16.317
which she just brought to me.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.535
Help yourselves.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.494
So you're not mad?

13:19.537 --> 13:21.061
Mad? Quite.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.497
Angry? No.

[elevator bell dings]That said, what say

I'm with Duck.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.635
Tox results, Abbs?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.246
Tox talk, yes,
but first,

13:32.289 --> 13:34.248
Ducky was right
about the head wound.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.120
It's definitely blunt-force
and not caused by the truck.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.819
He was hit hours earlier
with something cylindrical

13:39.862 --> 13:42.865
like a bat or a pipe.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.258
Knocked out and taped up.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.521
And... drugged.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.262
His tox came back positive

13:48.305 --> 13:51.526
for MDMA, or Ecstasy,
as the kids call it.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.962
Simms is no kid, Abbs.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.790
ABBY: Still, he had, like,
three hits worth in him.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.878
Which would

13:55.922 --> 13:57.619
undoubtedly contribute
to his apparent

13:57.662 --> 13:59.664
intoxication.Actually,

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
Doctor, if I may, Ecstasy
is more of a stimulant

14:01.928 --> 14:04.234
than a depressant,
so he would present

14:04.278 --> 14:05.409
as euphoric,
not drunk.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.584
ABBY:
That euphoria

14:06.628 --> 14:08.195
would cause
an accelerated heart rate

14:08.238 --> 14:10.240
and increased
body temperature,

14:10.284 --> 14:12.939
resulting in
severe dehydration,

14:12.982 --> 14:16.159
which naturally
would lead to an extreme,

full of water, he fed it to him.

Yeah.

favorite watering holes--

14:34.177 --> 14:35.613
pardon the expression--

14:35.657 --> 14:37.267
and none of them seemed
the least bit ravey.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.661
Simms clearly did not
take it for a good time.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.141

it in his drink.

he'd made two calls

14:47.712 --> 14:48.975

but only the first

14:49.018 --> 14:50.585

in this case,

have admitted so much.

who says Simms was here.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.365

I don't know.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.888
Look, I just don't
like getting involved.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.020
Oh.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.239
Sure, he had

19:13.282 --> 19:15.763
a couple beers,
chatted up a few ladies

19:15.806 --> 19:17.417
as usual.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.722
I guess he
bounced at, like,

19:18.766 --> 19:21.290

10:00, 10:30.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.596

19:22.639 --> 19:24.772
Look, I'm their
bartender, not their mom.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.644
All right, wait.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.819
Hey, Lana,

19:28.863 --> 19:31.213
you know if G.I. Jay
got lucky last night?

19:31.257 --> 19:32.345
Doubtful.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.955
Not for lack of trying.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.739
Yeah, well,

19:35.783 --> 19:37.828

with the ladies.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.221
Yeah, we've heard.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.918
TONY: Then you have no idea
how a guy like Simms

19:40.962 --> 19:42.790
would get his hands
on some Ecstasy.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.400
That guy?

19:44.444 --> 19:47.534
Yeah, uh, he's not
exactly the Ecstasy type.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.972
Like I said, he has a couple
drinks and works on the women.

19:51.015 --> 19:52.321
There a problem?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.236
Hey.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.237
Let me go!

19:55.281 --> 19:56.847
You don't want
to fight.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.200
TONY:
Oh!

20:01.243 --> 20:02.984
We have a winner.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.420
Those aren't mine.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.726
Well, they came
from your pocket.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.467
Let me guess:

20:07.510 --> 20:08.946
That's not your apron.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.340

20:12.515 --> 20:14.778

20:16.998 --> 20:19.740
They're for personal use,
all right?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.829
I hardly ever talked
to that Jason guy,

20:21.872 --> 20:23.396
let alone give him any.

20:23.439 --> 20:27.269
You never took his order?

20:27.313 --> 20:28.966
Never had an ax to grind?

20:29.010 --> 20:31.273
Ask anyone.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.667
I avoided him
like a redneck relative

20:33.710 --> 20:35.799
and he stuck to girls
more his own age.

20:36.844 --> 20:40.021
Anyone ever have it
out for Simms?

20:40.064 --> 20:43.894
Maybe...

20:43.938 --> 20:45.287
they slipped you
a few extra bucks,

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028

in his beer?

20:47.071 --> 20:48.986
Please.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.292
I would never.

20:50.336 --> 20:54.731
Well, I'm gonna find
out soon enough anyway.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.125
How...?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.519
We're gonna compare your X

20:59.562 --> 21:02.217
with what was found
inside Simms.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.180
I've got people, Lana,

21:09.224 --> 21:11.966
who can take this
hair of yours

21:12.009 --> 21:13.315
and test it and they can tell me

21:13.359 --> 21:17.928
whether your mother smoked
regular or menthol.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.759
[giggles]

21:22.803 --> 21:25.022
You wouldn't believe
how many cases

21:25.066 --> 21:26.285
I'm finding
of kids dropping X

21:26.328 --> 21:28.896
at parties, only to water
themselves to death.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.724
What I can't believe is
that you totally blabbed

21:30.767 --> 21:32.116
about Ducky's
girlfriend,

21:32.160 --> 21:34.684
and I told you that in
the strictest confidence.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.033
Well, I-I didn't blab.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.732
Okay? It was more like Ziva
and I comparing notes.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.386
And I did not give you up
as my source.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.301
TONY:
Let me get this straight.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.999
Abby is your source?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.261
What's the big secret?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.871
You've been my source
on plenty of stuff.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.787
Um, well, not for gossip.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.789
Sorry, Tony-- I mean,
I can't tell you things

21:52.833 --> 21:54.443
'cause you totally blab.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.184
Kind of like
some other people

21:56.227 --> 21:58.882
that I find myself
suddenly disappointed in.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.928
How could I have fallen
so far down the trust ladder?

22:00.971 --> 22:02.277
Not a ladder, DiNozzo.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.452
More like a step stool.

22:03.496 --> 22:04.932
GIBBS:
Abbs?

22:04.975 --> 22:07.021
Um, no Ecstasy results yet,

22:07.064 --> 22:09.110
but the mud
on Simms' wheel wells

22:09.153 --> 22:11.330
might be able to tell us where
he went after he left the bar.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.288
The basic elements
are ultisols,

22:13.332 --> 22:14.768
or Virginia red clay,

22:14.811 --> 22:17.466
and it's mixed in
with various animal scat

22:17.510 --> 22:20.295
and these egg casings
from Orconectes rusticus.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.906
Commonly known
as the rusty crayfish.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.081
How common?

22:24.125 --> 22:25.213
Oh, not at all.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.694
They're native
to Midwest waters,

22:27.737 --> 22:28.999
and they're nonindigenous
to Virginia.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.914
McGEE:
Abby, can I check something?

22:30.958 --> 22:34.570
Boss, that mud would come from
a very specific location.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.964
We got something here.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.880
Recent infestation
of rusty crayfish

22:39.923 --> 22:42.273
discovered in a stream
at Leesylvania State Park.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.710
Doesn't say where exactly.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.494
That's over 500 acres.

22:45.538 --> 22:48.192
It's going to take awhile
to narrow down.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.717
The highway Simms was killed on
runs right past that park.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.023
That's a toll road,
with toll plazas.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.069
With cameras. Go on.

22:59.682 --> 23:04.078
So how was dinner
last night, Dr. Mallard?

23:04.121 --> 23:06.167
Nothing like a good paella, huh?

23:06.210 --> 23:09.649
Am I wrong in detecting a
certain air of wistfulness

23:09.692 --> 23:13.043
in your efforts to find out
about Mary, Mr. Palmer?

23:13.087 --> 23:15.132
[keyboard clicks,

23:15.176 --> 23:17.657
Just looking out for you,
I guess.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.093
Really?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.878
I must admit that after
the death of my dear mother,

23:21.922 --> 23:25.360
I fell into a rather...
a personal funk.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.144
Mm. Miss the house?

23:27.188 --> 23:28.537
Not especially.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.886
[chuckles]

23:29.930 --> 23:32.280
Oddly enough, I miss the dogs.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.064
But, as I was saying,

23:34.108 --> 23:36.458
when it comes to matters
of romantic cardiology,

23:36.502 --> 23:38.852
it is my heart to break,
not yours.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.157
I-I know that, Doctor.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.637
I-I'm sorry.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.247
Then what are we
really talking about?

23:43.291 --> 23:45.815
Is this about Breena perhaps?

23:45.859 --> 23:48.775
Your impending nuptials?

23:48.818 --> 23:51.125
Okay...

23:51.168 --> 23:55.999
I suppose with changes
in my personal life,

23:56.043 --> 23:57.697
I could always count on
a stable work environment.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.742
And now, suddenly,

23:59.786 --> 24:03.137
things seem to be changing
for you as well, and I...

24:03.180 --> 24:04.965
Change is inevitable
and necessary,

24:05.008 --> 24:07.184
like the seasons, Mr. Palmer.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.273

28:43.460 --> 28:44.635
She's currently serving

28:44.679 --> 28:46.115
her third Marine tour
in Afghanistan.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.465
Make that his estranged wife.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.511
Lieutenant Jolene Alcott
has been

28:50.554 --> 28:53.514
legally separated from Sam
for the last six months.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.168
Their children live
with her mother.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.647
You spoke
to her?
Yeah.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.649
She said the distance
was too hard on the marriage.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.913
They attended counseling,
but Sam ultimately left her

29:00.956 --> 29:02.523
to pursue another woman.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.221
Okay, Alcott's last
credit-card pop

29:05.265 --> 29:06.788
was three nights ago

29:06.832 --> 29:10.226
at a place called
Hairy Toody's Café in Reston.

29:10.270 --> 29:13.621
Manager said that he went up,
had a burger at the bar,

29:13.664 --> 29:16.232
chatted up a few of the ladies,
and then left alone.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.799
Sounds familiar.

29:19.845 --> 29:23.457
Oh-- makes two dead cheaters
with military ties, of course.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.545
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.807
Abbs, I'm
right here.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.244
Sorry, I'm just
a little ecstatic,

29:28.288 --> 29:30.203
like the stuff
from Lana the waitress,

29:30.246 --> 29:32.814
which turned out
to be pretty weak.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.556
It was 100 milligrams MDMA
that was cut with baby aspirin.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.123
Street name-- Hatchethead.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.516
The Ecstasy
that Simms was dosed with

29:39.560 --> 29:42.302
was pure
130 milligrams MDMA,

29:42.345 --> 29:43.912
no additives.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.261
Street name-- Hammer and Sickle.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.654
Damn Commies.

29:46.697 --> 29:48.264
So, no match.
No.

29:48.308 --> 29:50.919
The drugs that the killer used
did not come from Lana.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.450
Your X didn't kill
these guys, Lana.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.717
But this one did.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.154
ZIVA: You know, you may be
cleared for murder,

30:08.197 --> 30:10.983
but you still have to answer
for the possession charge.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.989
Who sells those?

30:17.032 --> 30:19.339
I want a deal.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.167
[laughs]
Oh, come on.
I watch TV.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.778
You guys must swing deals
like this all the time.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.911
Oh, here-- these are
Hammer and Sickles.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.522
Randy's famous for them.
It's primo E.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.351
Randy, huh?

30:32.395 --> 30:35.181
Okay, so I'm bad at this.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.662
Look, I can still cut a deal for
his last name, though, can't I?

30:38.706 --> 30:40.099
Please?

30:42.231 --> 30:44.233
[eerie music playing
on video game]

30:47.454 --> 30:49.891
Jonas, the name is Randy Jonas.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.633
Virginia state parole records
indicate he's a patient here.

30:52.676 --> 30:55.462
[grunts, switches game off]

30:56.637 --> 30:59.292
Who are you again?

30:59.335 --> 31:03.426
NCIS Special Agents
DiNozzo and McGee.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.124
Sorry to wake you.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.083
Yeah, well,
it's way past visitors' hours.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.432
We're investigating
Jonas' connection

31:09.476 --> 31:11.217
to a series of murders
involving

31:11.260 --> 31:12.914
Ecstasy he
may have sold.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.264
Must be
Hammer and Sickles, right?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.832
He's known for those.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.355
That's kind of why we're here.

31:19.399 --> 31:22.097
Wish I could help you,
fellas, but since

31:22.141 --> 31:24.230
Randy's in for court-ordered
drug treatment,

31:24.273 --> 31:27.842
technically, he's under
state jurisdiction, so...

31:27.886 --> 31:29.365
Yeah, I don't think
the state will mind.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.498
Yeah, but my boss will.

31:31.541 --> 31:34.893
The supervisors here are
real sticklers for protocol.

31:34.936 --> 31:38.026
I'm under strict orders--
nobody out, nobody in.

31:38.070 --> 31:41.769
Let me guess,
you're alumni here, aren't you?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.945
Yeah.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.381
Can we speak
to your supervisors?

31:45.425 --> 31:47.427
Ooh, um...

31:48.863 --> 31:50.430
In the morning?

31:50.473 --> 31:54.173
They don't really like me
bothering them at night, uh...

31:54.216 --> 31:57.176
I bet they don't like
hearing from you any time.

31:57.219 --> 32:00.353
[laughing]:
No, they don't, yeah.

32:00.396 --> 32:03.312
You know, Randy's in the first
week of his month sentence.

32:03.356 --> 32:04.574
Can't you come back?

32:04.618 --> 32:06.620
Did you say
he's been here one week?

32:06.663 --> 32:09.928
Yeah.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.408
Meaning he's not
our killer.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.455
Still could have
supplied the drugs.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.457
[lilting romantic ballad
playing]

32:17.500 --> 32:19.676
[doorbell chimes]

32:24.681 --> 32:26.640
Donald, you had
me worried.

32:26.683 --> 32:27.815
You didn't answer
your phone.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.904
I'm sorry, darling,
I-I was just trying

32:29.948 --> 32:31.340
to spare you
the ill effects

32:31.384 --> 32:33.734
of what has been
a trying day.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.649
Oh...
[gentle laugh]

32:35.692 --> 32:37.956
Well, then, let
me make it better.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.131
Red or white?

32:39.174 --> 32:40.480
Oh, whatever you're having.

32:40.523 --> 32:41.350
Thank you.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.005
Oh, what's all this?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.747
Baskets for kids at a
homeless shelter in Edgewood.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.531
I still have a few to go.

32:48.575 --> 32:49.315
Would you like to help?

32:49.358 --> 32:51.404
Oh, very much so.

32:51.447 --> 32:52.883
That is, after you've
rested for a bit,

32:52.927 --> 32:54.015
and told me all about
your day.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.147
Forget my day.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.584
What was yours like?

32:57.627 --> 33:00.021
That's not how this works.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.328
My day was fine,
and if yours wasn't,

33:02.371 --> 33:05.418
I take it as a personal
challenge to make it better.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.593
So start talking.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.380
Yeah, well,
suffice it to say

33:11.424 --> 33:14.427
I most certainly erred in
expressing my fascination

33:14.470 --> 33:16.385
at Simms' killer.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.560
This is your water person.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.433
He's delivered
another victim.

33:20.476 --> 33:21.738
But in doing so,

33:21.782 --> 33:23.566
he snapped me back
to the reality

33:23.610 --> 33:25.655
of what a sadistic
bastard he is.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.397
Sick, twisted, vicious,

33:28.441 --> 33:31.835
and there's nothing novel
about what he does.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.576
I cited his creativity,

33:33.620 --> 33:35.361
when, in fact, he doesn't
create a thing--

33:35.404 --> 33:36.536
just destroys...

33:36.579 --> 33:40.061
in a heartless and
diabolical fashion.

33:40.105 --> 33:44.544
So much for not infecting my
personal life with my work.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.067
Why, only today,

33:46.111 --> 33:48.374
I was advising my technician,
Jimmy Palmer...

33:48.417 --> 33:50.463
[stammers]

33:50.506 --> 33:52.291
Mary?

33:52.334 --> 33:54.075
Are you all right?

33:54.119 --> 33:55.903
You're welcome.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.644
I'm sorry?

34:01.648 --> 34:03.128
You should be.

34:03.171 --> 34:05.695
Saying such horrible things
about a person

34:05.739 --> 34:09.177
who clearly went to a lot of
trouble for you.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.614
This "sadistic bastard"
just wanted

34:11.658 --> 34:12.963
to help you, Donald.

34:13.007 --> 34:16.445
Show you something you hadn't
seen before.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.099
And, believe me...

34:18.143 --> 34:20.145
it was not easy.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.756
Believe...?

34:24.584 --> 34:26.803
You...?

34:33.114 --> 34:34.681
ZIVA: Okay, we have
two victims--

34:34.724 --> 34:36.204
one military, the other one,
a military spouse.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.946
Each with a failed marriage.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.948
Neither one of 'em could
keep it zipped.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.428
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

34:42.471 --> 34:43.907
ZIVA: Well, not the most
sympathetic victims.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.867
Perhaps the killer
believed they
deserved to die.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.087
Well, at least they
went to counseling.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.131
Should count
for something.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.046
Say that again.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.093
Well, they-- I'm just
saying they tried
to make it work.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.964
Just shows that they
weren't complete jerks.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.183
Their counseling-- where?

34:58.226 --> 35:00.141
ZIVA: Two different
family service centers.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.926
One in the Palisades and the
other one in Capitol Heights.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.103
But on opposite sides
of DC.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.106
Both part of the same outreach
program for military families.

35:08.149 --> 35:11.370
Randy Jonas's rehab-- that part
of the same outreach program?

35:11.413 --> 35:12.936
Only one way
to find out.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.329
GIBBS:
McGee--

35:14.373 --> 35:15.939
you got toll booth surveillance
on Alcott?

35:15.983 --> 35:18.464
Right here.

35:18.507 --> 35:19.465
Four nights ago,

35:19.508 --> 35:21.162
Sam Alcott headed
to the park,

35:21.206 --> 35:22.337
just like Simms.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.904
Both alone.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.994
But each knowing how to get
to that section of the park.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.648
Meaning they were
either given directions...

35:28.691 --> 35:30.911
Or they followed someone.
Check earlier frames.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.002
ZIVA:
The drug rehab facility is part

35:35.045 --> 35:37.004
of the same
outreach program

35:37.047 --> 35:38.658
as the two
family service centers.

35:38.701 --> 35:41.835
And each facility is supervised
by a handful of administrators.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.489
McGEE: Got a common
face here, boss.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.100
A few cars ahead of
Alcott and Simms.

35:48.668 --> 35:52.367
Okay... here's the group
from the rehab center.

35:54.064 --> 35:57.720
And here are the two groups
from the counseling centers.

35:57.764 --> 36:02.160
All three, one face in common.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.600
Mary.

36:07.643 --> 36:08.992
Ducky's Mary?

36:09.036 --> 36:10.080
[Gibbs dialing phone]

36:10.124 --> 36:11.212
JIMMY:
Autopsy.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.214
Palmer... where's Ducky?

36:13.258 --> 36:16.696
MARY: I know that
what I did was extreme,

36:16.739 --> 36:20.047
but men like you don't
come along very often, Donald.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.919
I wouldn't have done this
for just anyone.

36:22.963 --> 36:26.227
Or to just anyone,
for that matter.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.012
Simms and Alcott-- why them?

36:29.056 --> 36:30.318
Well...

36:30.362 --> 36:32.581
if I was going to show you
something

36:32.625 --> 36:34.279
you hadn't seen before,

36:34.322 --> 36:35.932
then they had to be military.

36:35.976 --> 36:40.981
And fortunately, our case
files are just teeming

36:41.024 --> 36:42.591
with deserving candidates.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.289
How many men
were you going to kill?

36:44.332 --> 36:46.204
Kill?

36:46.247 --> 36:48.858
No, Donald.

36:48.902 --> 36:51.905
They killed themselves.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.561
They drank the water.

36:55.604 --> 36:59.434
Well, getting them to do that
could not have been easy.

36:59.478 --> 37:03.438
It did take a little effort.

37:03.482 --> 37:06.267
But these men...

37:06.311 --> 37:08.313
they were weak.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.619
Getting them to follow me
out of the bar

37:10.663 --> 37:11.751
was the easy part.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.275
They took the bait so fast.

37:14.319 --> 37:18.061
And what happened next
served them right.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.542
They knew it.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.240
What?

37:23.589 --> 37:26.505
Are you looking to go?

37:26.548 --> 37:28.768
Go where?

37:28.811 --> 37:30.117
Mary,

37:30.160 --> 37:32.554
I'm with you.

37:36.732 --> 37:39.257
My father was tricky,
too, you know.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.042
He was a real sweet-talker.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.218
But I am not your
father, Mary,

37:44.262 --> 37:46.438
any more than Simms
and Alcott were.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.092
These were not
good men, Donald.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.659
Not to you.

37:50.703 --> 37:54.228
And perhaps not
to their ex-wives.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.795
But to their children?

37:55.838 --> 37:57.710
To their parents?

37:57.753 --> 38:02.497
They were not murderers,
Mary, they were not rapists,

38:02.541 --> 38:05.239
any more than you were
their judge, jury

38:05.283 --> 38:08.155
or executioner.

38:10.636 --> 38:12.507
I didn't mean...

38:14.727 --> 38:16.163
I didn't...

38:16.206 --> 38:17.686
I didn't...

38:17.730 --> 38:20.559
Now, give me the
scissors, Mary.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.779
Come on.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.955

38:27.217 --> 38:29.785

Oh, Donald!

38:37.619 --> 38:40.013
Duck, you all right?

38:41.014 --> 38:42.581
Let me talk to
her, Jethro.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.973
I was so close.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.540
I can get her to
come out peacefully.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.412
She won't harm me.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.980
Let me in, Mary.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.242
Please?

Oh, Mary.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.693
Love...

39:07.736 --> 39:11.000
can cloud our vision.

39:13.263 --> 39:18.268
Make us see things
as we wish to see them.

39:20.445 --> 39:24.100
See things as they are not.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.418
I only wanted you to stay.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.378
I know.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.905
Get an ambulance.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.400
[elevator bell dings]

40:06.360 --> 40:10.451
Tony and McGee are with Mary
at the emergency room.

40:10.495 --> 40:13.541
She'll be transferred
to their psychiatric ward

40:13.585 --> 40:15.195
in the morning.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.153
I'm sorry, Ducky.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.241
Me, too.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.286
Thanks, Ziva.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.471
Duck, I wish I had that

40:30.515 --> 40:32.691
Yogi Berra book of quotes
for any occasion.

40:34.519 --> 40:39.828
You know, Jethro, psychotic
behavior is so bizarre,

40:39.872 --> 40:44.311
yet I just can't understand
how I could have missed it.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.315
I'll never trust
my judgment again.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.143
You won't have to, Duck.

40:50.186 --> 40:52.232
We'll trust it for you.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.147
I'll take you home.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.498
Uh, I just want to
collect a few things,

40:57.542 --> 40:59.500
check my messages.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.415
Come on, Duck, it can wait.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.373
Jethro, do you mind?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.811
I just want to be alone
for a moment.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.163
Be upstairs.

41:20.129 --> 41:22.349
[sighs softly]

41:22.392 --> 41:24.351
[computer chimes]

41:24.394 --> 41:26.484
Hmm?
