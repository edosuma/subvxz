00:35.130 --> 00:37.351
- Hello?
- This is Principal Hudgins

00:37.469 --> 00:39.303
calling from
the White Pine Bay High School

00:39.404 --> 00:40.654
emergency phone tree.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.157
I'm sorry to report
that one of our teachers,

00:43.275 --> 00:46.038
Blaire Watson,
was found dead this morning,

00:46.278 --> 00:48.229
the victim of a violent crime

00:48.330 --> 00:49.897
which is currently
being investigated

00:49.998 --> 00:52.033
by the sheriff's office.

00:52.117 --> 00:55.002
This has been a profound loss
for all of us.

00:55.087 --> 00:57.872
There will be no school Monday
so members of our community

00:57.956 --> 01:00.258
can attend
her memorial service.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.126
We encourage everyone to attend

01:02.244 --> 01:04.411
to celebrate the life
of this wonderful teacher.

01:04.513 --> 01:06.514
What is it?

01:14.273 --> 01:17.108
That was the principal
of your school.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.111
What happened?

01:23.115 --> 01:26.150
Norman...
what happened last night?

01:26.268 --> 01:27.935
You said something
about Miss Watson

01:28.036 --> 01:30.437
was going
to give you a ride home?

01:32.491 --> 01:33.774
- Uh-huh.
- But she didn't?

01:33.876 --> 01:37.245
You never got in the car?

01:37.329 --> 01:39.464
I don't remember.

01:39.581 --> 01:43.117
I just remember running home.

01:47.381 --> 01:48.982
I guess she couldn't
have given me a ride

01:49.007 --> 01:52.093
if I was running home, right?

01:54.563 --> 01:56.564
Why?

02:00.018 --> 02:03.154
Um...
Miss Watson is dead.

02:06.108 --> 02:08.359
What?

02:08.476 --> 02:11.496
Apparently, someone killed her.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.335
Man, who is born of a woman,

02:17.452 --> 02:21.822
has but a short time to live,
and is full of misery.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.825
He comes up and is cut down
like a flower.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.762
In the midst of life,
we are in death.

02:27.846 --> 02:30.431
Of whom may we seek
for our succor, oh lord,

02:30.516 --> 02:34.468
who is justly displeased
because of our sins?

02:34.553 --> 02:37.338
Yet, oh lord God most holy...

02:37.439 --> 02:41.442
Oh lord, most mighty, oh holy
and most merciful savior,

02:41.527 --> 02:44.979
deliver us not into the bitter
pains of eternal death.

02:45.063 --> 02:47.982
Do not shut your merciful ears
to our prayers...

02:54.072 --> 02:56.490
But spare us, lord most holy,

02:56.575 --> 02:59.493
oh, God most mighty,

02:59.578 --> 03:02.330
oh, holy and merciful savior,
most worthy judge eternal.

03:04.082 --> 03:06.367
Suffer us not,
in our last hour,

03:06.468 --> 03:10.004
for any pains of death,
to fall from your grace.

03:22.184 --> 03:25.102
You need to eat something.

03:31.243 --> 03:35.396
She was so kind.

03:35.497 --> 03:39.750
I can't imagine
why anyone would hurt her.

03:39.868 --> 03:41.469
Sweetheart,
you didn't really know her.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.171
You knew only one part of her.

03:44.256 --> 03:47.408
God knows what else was going on
in that woman's life.

03:49.211 --> 03:52.246
We only see the tip of
the iceberg with--with anyone.

03:52.347 --> 03:55.016
We see what people
want us to see, but--

03:55.100 --> 03:56.417
but that doesn't mean

03:56.518 --> 03:57.918
there wasn't something else
underneath.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.612
No, she wasn't a bad person.

03:59.732 --> 04:01.472
No, I'm not saying she was.

04:05.894 --> 04:08.279
- Who would do this to her?
- I don't know, honey.

04:08.397 --> 04:12.483
But it's not your problem
to figure out who, okay?

04:31.633 --> 04:33.113

To this lake here.
You can catch it at 11:15.

06:29.287 --> 06:30.838
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:30.922 --> 06:32.373
- How's it going?
- Good.

06:32.457 --> 06:35.126
It got busy.
Everyone came in all at once.

06:35.243 --> 06:37.077
Where's Norman?
He's supposed to be here.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.547
I-I haven't seen him.

06:42.934 --> 06:46.086
Do you want me to go look--
look for him?

06:46.188 --> 06:47.721
No, no.

06:47.806 --> 06:49.857
- I'll get him.
- Okay.

07:11.963 --> 07:14.415
Norman?

07:16.218 --> 07:17.968
You're supposed to be
in the office.

07:18.086 --> 07:19.887
Put that down
and get back down there.

07:19.971 --> 07:22.139
Mother,
just let me finish this.

07:22.257 --> 07:23.974
What does that mean?

07:24.092 --> 07:26.177
Five minutes, five hours?
You're taking apart a woodchuck.

07:26.294 --> 07:27.678
I don't know how long
that's supposed to take.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.181
- There's a line of customers.
- Fine.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.349
And it's a beaver,
not a woodchuck.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.185
It's the first
sophisticated animal

07:34.302 --> 07:37.488
I've had the chance
to work on by myself.

07:45.864 --> 07:46.980
Norman, seriously,

07:47.082 --> 07:48.332
you spend too much time
in the basement.

07:48.450 --> 07:50.000
It's not normal.

07:50.118 --> 07:52.786
You need to be out in the world,
doing normal things.

07:52.871 --> 07:54.371
Can we go driving?
You know my test is coming up.

07:54.489 --> 07:55.850
I definitely
need to be practicing.

07:55.957 --> 07:58.843
Yes!
Yes, we can go driving,

07:58.960 --> 08:01.011
but I need you to come down
and help me

08:01.129 --> 08:05.966
take care of customers
in our sold-out motel!

08:09.354 --> 08:10.837
Hey, Emma.

08:10.939 --> 08:12.339
- Hey, Norman.
- Sorry.

08:12.440 --> 08:17.394
- Wow, it's busy, huh?
- Yeah, I took care of it.

08:17.512 --> 08:21.181
Oh, these came for you.

08:23.118 --> 08:25.236
I guess you sent these
to Bradley.

08:36.769 --> 08:38.352
I was just concerned about her,

08:38.437 --> 08:40.554
you know, after the accident.

08:40.655 --> 08:41.554
You know,
it wasn't an accident.

08:41.657 --> 08:43.441
She jumped off a bridge.

08:43.558 --> 08:46.778
It's a euphemism.
You know, I know what happened.

08:52.567 --> 08:56.570
You know, she's getting out
of the mental hospital today.

08:58.573 --> 09:02.243
Yeah, I ran into Jenna in town.
She--she told me.

09:02.344 --> 09:04.212
Why would she tell you
about it?

09:04.296 --> 09:06.964
Because I asked
how Bradley was.

09:07.082 --> 09:09.434
Oh.

09:09.551 --> 09:12.437
Well, well, good.

09:12.554 --> 09:15.389
Yeah, yeah,
I'm glad she's better.

09:58.767 --> 10:02.019
Hi, honey.

10:06.441 --> 10:08.910
Hi, mom.

10:08.994 --> 10:12.997
Heard we're going home.

10:26.845 --> 10:28.379
What's that?

10:28.496 --> 10:30.515
I want to start
paying you rent.

10:30.632 --> 10:32.517
I know I keep saying
I'm gonna move out,

10:32.634 --> 10:34.635
but I haven't moved out yet,
have I?

10:37.606 --> 10:40.608
I'm not taking your money.
I know where you get it.

10:40.692 --> 10:42.527
Norma, that's stupid.

10:42.644 --> 10:43.778
You might as well say
that you're not gonna go

10:43.862 --> 10:45.613
to the laundry or the car wash.

10:45.697 --> 10:47.481
Okay, because let's be honest,

10:47.566 --> 10:48.733
everything in this town exists
because of the weed industry.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.318
My motel doesn't.

10:50.402 --> 10:54.021
It's just happy people
on vacations.

10:54.122 --> 10:56.624
Okay, Norma, whatever.

10:56.708 --> 11:00.962
All right, I'm just gonna
leave that there though.

11:01.046 --> 11:06.000
You don't ever have to take it,
but I'm trying.

11:21.516 --> 11:23.550
Are you gonna pass this guy?

11:23.652 --> 11:25.519
- No.
- Well, then why did you

11:25.604 --> 11:26.904
look in the side mirror
and edge out like that?

11:27.022 --> 11:30.825
I was thinking
about passing him.

11:30.909 --> 11:32.510
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:32.560 --> 11:33.945
You're too far off the road
on this side!

11:34.062 --> 11:35.696
- Get back towards the middle.
- I can drive, mother,

11:35.781 --> 11:37.661
without you telling me
every little thing to do!

11:37.732 --> 11:40.734
Excuse me if I don't want you
to suddenly find your wheel

11:40.836 --> 11:42.286
off the road in the dirt,

11:42.404 --> 11:44.422
and then suddenly,
we veer off into a tree.

11:44.539 --> 11:46.424
Of course, I wouldn't know
how to not drive into a tree

11:46.488 --> 11:47.768
if it wasn't
for your assistance.

11:47.793 --> 11:50.845
Come on.

11:50.929 --> 11:53.631
If you are going to pass
this guy, which you should,

11:53.748 --> 11:56.417
make sure it's totally clear
and then use your blinker.

11:56.518 --> 11:58.352
I know how
to use the blinker, mom.

11:58.437 --> 11:59.920
Okay.

12:00.022 --> 12:02.023
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:02.107 --> 12:05.693
Floor it, floor it!
Get around this guy.

12:05.777 --> 12:09.430
Hurry!

12:09.531 --> 12:11.365
Good.
Good, very good.

12:11.466 --> 12:12.650
No, you're kidding.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.568
You're actually
complimenting me?

12:14.653 --> 12:16.203
Now don't be sarcastic.
I'm just trying to help you.

12:16.288 --> 12:17.488
Or do you want to not drive?

12:17.605 --> 12:19.773
I'm not sure that I am driving.

12:23.495 --> 12:26.631
Oh, Norman, not here again.

12:26.748 --> 12:28.466
Norman, Miss Watson
passed away four months ago.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.885
No, she was murdered.

12:30.969 --> 12:33.804
I never got the chance
to say good-bye.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.843
When is this gonna end?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.478
What?

12:40.595 --> 12:43.481
This endless moping around
about Miss Watson!

12:43.598 --> 12:45.566
Yes, it was horrible
and it was sad,

12:45.651 --> 12:47.968
but it's not like
she was your friend

12:48.070 --> 12:50.321
or a girlfriend or a relative.

12:50.439 --> 12:53.491
She was just your teacher!

12:53.608 --> 12:54.942
You're a teenager, it's summer.

12:55.027 --> 12:57.495
You should be out, I don't know,
playing baseball

12:57.612 --> 12:59.980
or going to swimming holes
or something normal.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.808
I don't think mourning
the death of someone

13:01.833 --> 13:04.651
who had been special to you
is particularly abnormal!

13:04.753 --> 13:06.487
Oh, I am just
a little concerned

13:06.588 --> 13:08.539
that you seem obsessed with...

13:08.656 --> 13:12.927
morbidity or something.

13:13.011 --> 13:14.378
I mean, you spend your days

13:14.496 --> 13:15.596
equally mooning over
a dead teacher

13:15.681 --> 13:16.964
and taking apart dead animals.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.550
It's just weird.
It's not right, Norman.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.218
It makes me feel like
a bad mother.

13:21.336 --> 13:23.471
- You're not a bad mother.
- Well, whatever.

13:23.555 --> 13:25.856
The point is,
it's not healthy for you.

13:25.974 --> 13:29.477
You--you need to spend time
with actual living organisms.

13:29.561 --> 13:32.679
Come on, let's go home.

13:32.781 --> 13:35.066
You drive.

13:44.910 --> 13:46.911
Oh.

13:51.049 --> 13:53.467
Whew, whoa, you're going 42!

13:53.552 --> 13:55.586
- I saw the speed limit was 35.
- Stop it.

13:55.703 --> 13:58.506
And you hit two
of those bump thingies

13:58.590 --> 13:59.807
in the middle of the road.

13:59.891 --> 14:01.258
I'm afraid
you might just suddenly

14:01.376 --> 14:04.378
veer off
into an oncoming truck or--

14:04.479 --> 14:07.047
Mother, what are you doing?

14:14.055 --> 14:15.406
Excuse me,
what's going on here?

14:15.524 --> 14:17.191
This here
is the new bypass road.

14:17.275 --> 14:18.659
It's gonna connect from here
to the main highway

14:18.744 --> 14:20.494
on the far side of town.

14:20.579 --> 14:23.914
Yeah, I know all about it,
but--but why are you here now?

14:24.032 --> 14:25.699
I-I read it was delayed
for funding.

14:25.784 --> 14:27.284
Look, lady, all I know

14:27.402 --> 14:28.753
is that we're gonna
break ground on Monday.

14:28.870 --> 14:32.590
Monday?

14:32.707 --> 14:35.042
Okay.

14:37.078 --> 14:39.346
Okay, thank you.

14:42.717 --> 14:46.353
What's the matter?

14:46.438 --> 14:47.855
They're building
the new bypass.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.440
They're actually building it.

14:49.558 --> 14:50.924
I thought I had time
to fight it.

14:51.026 --> 14:52.526
What did he say, mother?

14:52.611 --> 14:54.982
They're starting work
on Monday.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.599
This is the road
that's gonna ruin our lives.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.934
Mom, I'm just walking
into the village, okay?

15:09.035 --> 15:12.180
- They have a meeting tomorrow.
- Who has a meeting?

15:12.300 --> 15:13.621
The White Pine Bay
City Council.

15:13.685 --> 15:15.486
I'm putting my name
on the agenda to speak.

15:15.604 --> 15:18.152
To speak about what?

15:18.272 --> 15:22.193
The bypass.

15:22.310 --> 15:23.527
Mom, what are you gonna say?

15:23.645 --> 15:26.247
You need to prepare
for something like that.

15:26.331 --> 15:29.166
I will be prepared.
I have until tomorrow.

15:30.836 --> 15:32.703
Norman, we have to fight this.

15:32.821 --> 15:34.338
You've got to stand up
for yourself in life.

15:34.456 --> 15:36.123
You can't let the world
run over you.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.758
Mom, you--
how are you gonna stop

15:37.843 --> 15:40.544
a city from building a road?

15:40.662 --> 15:43.264
Come here.

15:43.348 --> 15:47.051
Come here.
Look out there.

15:47.168 --> 15:49.220
We did that.

15:49.337 --> 15:51.772
All those cars, all those people
out there in our motel,

15:51.857 --> 15:53.224
all of them, every single one,

15:53.341 --> 15:55.726
found us driving
along the main road.

15:57.529 --> 15:58.779
Remember that first night

15:58.864 --> 16:01.682
we got to turn on
the "No vacancy" sign?

16:01.783 --> 16:03.034
Uh-huh.

16:03.151 --> 16:05.403
You remember
what that felt like?

16:05.520 --> 16:08.072
Yeah.

16:08.189 --> 16:10.157
We started over.

16:10.242 --> 16:13.160
We came here to do it,
and we did it,

16:13.245 --> 16:16.380
and I'm not letting anyone
take that away from us, okay?

16:16.498 --> 16:19.717
I will figure it out.

16:19.835 --> 16:22.586
Okay, mother.

16:22.704 --> 16:24.171
Where'd you say you were going?

16:24.256 --> 16:27.174
Oh, um, into the village.

16:27.259 --> 16:29.226
Okay.

16:29.344 --> 16:31.262
Have fun.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.481
See you in a bit.

16:33.565 --> 16:35.716
You'll see, Norman.

16:35.817 --> 16:39.186
We're gonna do this.
It's all gonna be good!

17:05.763 --> 17:09.215
Bradley Martin,
what do you want?

17:11.269 --> 17:13.554
I want to know
who killed my dad.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.358
I don't know who killed your dad.

17:18.443 --> 17:20.478
I find that hard to believe.

17:20.595 --> 17:23.430
You worked with him every day.
You must know something.

17:23.531 --> 17:26.599
Who his enemies were,
if someone had it out for him.

17:26.701 --> 17:29.570
How old are you?

17:29.654 --> 17:32.156
Old enough.

17:33.775 --> 17:37.277
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father,

17:37.379 --> 17:40.247
but all I can tell you
is stuff you don't want to hear.

17:40.332 --> 17:41.615
Try me.

17:41.716 --> 17:43.450
Your father was a shitheel.

17:43.552 --> 17:46.504
He was out for himself,
he had no loyalty to anyone,

17:46.621 --> 17:50.224
and that's a bad move
in this business.

17:51.726 --> 17:54.294
That's a good start.

17:57.682 --> 18:00.300
I could tell you more,
if you want to come inside.

18:02.854 --> 18:04.522
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:04.639 --> 18:06.690
So go home, kid.

18:06.808 --> 18:10.027
Forget about him!

19:37.666 --> 19:41.252
- What?
- It's mom.

19:41.369 --> 19:45.172
It's locked.

19:45.257 --> 19:46.573
Yeah?

19:46.675 --> 19:50.244
A boy is here to see you.
Norman Bates?

19:58.920 --> 20:01.272
I wrote you nearly every day
you were in the institution.

20:01.389 --> 20:03.190
I know.

20:04.559 --> 20:08.312
Thought I should be away
for a while.

20:08.429 --> 20:10.264
Well, how are you doing?

20:10.365 --> 20:13.234
Awesome.

20:13.318 --> 20:15.486
Okay.

20:15.603 --> 20:18.155
Human relationships are...

20:18.273 --> 20:21.275
glorious, aren't they, Norman?

20:26.781 --> 20:30.084
I guess I just wanted
to say one thing to you.

20:30.168 --> 20:34.305
I heard about what happened,
that you tried to kill yourself.

20:34.422 --> 20:36.640
I tried to imagine
what that would feel like,

20:36.758 --> 20:38.175
wanting to do that.

20:38.293 --> 20:41.295
It must have been
terribly isolating,

20:41.396 --> 20:43.063
feeling that you
had nowhere to turn,

20:43.148 --> 20:46.350
no one to talk to, no way out.

20:46.467 --> 20:50.137
But, uh...

20:50.238 --> 20:53.140
uh, you never
need to feel that way.

20:53.241 --> 20:56.277
You need to know that you
can always talk to me,

20:56.361 --> 20:58.028
and that I will always
be there for you,

20:58.146 --> 20:59.747
if you need me...

20:59.831 --> 21:03.334
as a friend.

21:07.172 --> 21:09.656
I just wanted to tell you that.

22:13.261 --> 22:14.684
Hey!

22:14.804 --> 22:17.166
Why are you taking pictures
of me?

22:18.933 --> 22:20.025
Hey!

22:33.387 --> 22:36.890
- Hey.
- Hey, Gil.

22:38.063 --> 22:39.980
Hey.

22:40.098 --> 22:42.449
Relax.

22:42.567 --> 22:44.618
Hey, if you see
Jerry Martin's kid

22:44.736 --> 22:46.120
poking around asking questions,

22:46.238 --> 22:48.622
get rid of her, all right?

22:48.740 --> 22:51.292
I don't want anybody
talking to her about anything.

22:52.124 --> 22:53.425
Why, what happened?

22:53.509 --> 22:55.149
Well, she showed up
at my place last night

22:55.160 --> 22:56.628
out of the blue,
asking questions.

22:56.712 --> 22:59.347
You know, who killed her dad.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.299
I don't need that shit.

23:01.384 --> 23:06.304
I thought I got rid
of my Jerry Martin problem.

23:06.389 --> 23:07.722
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.557
That girl's crazy, you know?

23:09.675 --> 23:11.359
I heard she was locked up.
It's a shame.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.479
She's smoking hot.

23:22.855 --> 23:24.906
Hey.

23:26.876 --> 23:31.212
Hey, why the hell does Gil
hate Jerry Martin so much?

23:31.330 --> 23:32.530
Probably because Jerry Martin

23:32.548 --> 23:35.500
was sleeping
with his girlfriend.

23:35.584 --> 23:38.219
Really?

23:38.337 --> 23:39.704
Who's that?

23:39.805 --> 23:41.756
Blaire Watson,
the chick who got killed.

23:41.874 --> 23:43.541
The daughter
of the other weed family.

23:43.642 --> 23:47.645
Let's go, we've got a run to do.
Come on.

23:55.154 --> 23:57.272
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

23:57.389 --> 23:58.573
Yeah, I was wondering
if it would be possible

23:58.691 --> 24:00.158
for me to see sheriff Romero?

24:00.242 --> 24:03.361
- Your name?
- Norman Bates.

24:12.371 --> 24:15.457
So, uh, what can I do
for you, Norman?

24:15.574 --> 24:20.378
Well, uh, today I was
at the graveyard, you know,

24:20.463 --> 24:23.465
up on Shepherd's Hill,
where Miss Watson's buried,

24:23.582 --> 24:27.385
and I saw this strange man
standing at her grave.

24:27.470 --> 24:30.722
Here, I took some photos
of him that,

24:30.806 --> 24:33.257
you know, I thought
might be helpful.

24:33.359 --> 24:34.793
That, uh--that maybe

24:34.894 --> 24:39.197
this man might have had
something to do with her murder.

24:46.288 --> 24:48.272
Well, why do you think that?

24:48.374 --> 24:50.575
Before she died,
I overheard her at school

24:50.659 --> 24:51.743
having an argument with someone

24:51.827 --> 24:54.996
on the phone,
someone named Eric.

24:55.114 --> 24:56.447
I just--I got suspicious

24:56.549 --> 24:58.550
when I saw that man
standing at her graveside.

25:07.226 --> 25:10.294
And, um, you--
you go to her grave a lot?

25:10.396 --> 25:12.230
I do, yeah.
Sometimes.

25:12.314 --> 25:13.464
Yeah?
How come?

25:13.566 --> 25:15.633
Uh, I don't know.

25:15.734 --> 25:20.738
I just feel so terrible
about her death.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.475
- It seems so unfair.
- Yeah.

25:23.576 --> 25:25.276
You ever go to her house?

25:25.377 --> 25:27.412
Me?

25:27.496 --> 25:29.814
I, um--I did, yeah.

25:29.915 --> 25:32.750
Yeah, when?

25:32.835 --> 25:36.821
Ooh, I don't remember exactly.

25:38.674 --> 25:40.658
Uh, we--you know,
we were working on

25:40.759 --> 25:42.594
a story I wrote for class,
and she liked it

25:42.678 --> 25:44.179
and wanted to try and help me
get it published,

25:44.296 --> 25:45.736
so we met at her house
to go over it.

25:45.798 --> 25:47.515
She was wonderful that way,
you know,

25:47.633 --> 25:51.469
Miss Watson, always trying
to be helpful to her students.

25:53.606 --> 25:54.672
Why? Why--

25:54.773 --> 25:56.391
did you find
any evidence, or--

25:56.508 --> 25:59.611
are my--my fingerprints
at her house, or--

25:59.695 --> 26:02.363
Well, if we did, we wouldn't
know they were yours, right?

26:02.481 --> 26:04.348
I mean, unless you'd ever
been fingerprinted before.

26:04.450 --> 26:07.619
I haven't.

26:10.573 --> 26:13.491
But I wouldn't
have been the only student

26:13.576 --> 26:16.044
to ever have gone
to her house, would I?

26:16.162 --> 26:17.762
No.

26:17.863 --> 26:19.297
We got a lot of prints
at her house

26:19.398 --> 26:21.599
that we assume
belong to students, yeah.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.134
Other teachers
told us she did a lot

26:23.235 --> 26:25.336
of school projects at her home.

26:25.437 --> 26:28.539
Yeah, don't worry.
We're gonna find her killer.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.227
That's very good to hear.

26:35.541 --> 26:37.541
Do you want me to email you
a copy of those photos?

26:37.566 --> 26:41.552
No, no, that's not necessary.
Thanks.

26:46.775 --> 26:50.778
Well, I'd--
I'd better be going.

26:59.171 --> 27:00.571
We understand
<i>Crime and Punishment</i>

27:00.589 --> 27:02.573
is a classic, but is it
really appropriate reading

27:02.675 --> 27:04.408
for high school students?

27:04.510 --> 27:06.711
An old lady gets murdered
with a hatchet

27:06.795 --> 27:08.636
very early in the book,
and the main character,

27:08.714 --> 27:11.516
who we're supposed
to feel sympathy for,

27:11.600 --> 27:13.251
is the murderer.

27:13.352 --> 27:14.473
His savior comes in the form

27:14.586 --> 27:17.138
of a prostitute named Sonya.
Really?

27:17.256 --> 27:20.058
Look, the PTA parents have
put together a list of books

27:20.142 --> 27:23.444
we think would be
more appropriate titles.

27:25.814 --> 27:27.532
Thank you, Marcy.

27:27.616 --> 27:30.268
We will discuss this
with the school board.

27:30.369 --> 27:33.154
All right, that's gonna
end the meeting for tonight.

27:33.272 --> 27:35.290
- All in favor, say, "Aye."
- Excuse me.

27:37.626 --> 27:39.661
Um, I signed up to be
on the agenda tonight.

27:39.778 --> 27:41.212
Uh, excuse me?

27:41.297 --> 27:43.798
It's about the new bypass.

27:43.916 --> 27:45.800
I read that it was delayed,

27:45.918 --> 27:49.304
and now I he that
it's being started on Monday?

27:49.421 --> 27:52.590
I don't support the road.
I'm proposing that we stop it.

27:52.675 --> 27:54.175
And you are?

27:54.293 --> 27:57.312
I'm Norma Bates.
I own the Bates Motel.

27:59.431 --> 28:03.467
And?

28:03.569 --> 28:07.105
Well, this new bypass
is gonna cut us off

28:07.189 --> 28:08.523
from all the traffic
going through town,

28:08.640 --> 28:10.158
and it's gonna destroy
our business.

28:10.276 --> 28:13.444
Well, approach the council,
Mrs. Bates.

28:20.452 --> 28:22.754
So--so what's your plan

28:22.838 --> 28:25.506
for stopping the bypass,
Norma Bates?

28:27.492 --> 28:29.493
- My plan?
- Mm.

28:33.515 --> 28:39.437
Well, um, I wanted to express
my views to the council.

28:39.521 --> 28:41.306
Which you've done.

28:41.390 --> 28:45.143
Anything else?

28:45.227 --> 28:49.564
I just--I don't see how
you can think this is okay.

28:49.681 --> 28:52.283
It's gonna create
this whole big, ugly strip

28:52.368 --> 28:55.186
of big-box stores and all sorts
of traffic out there.

28:55.287 --> 28:57.705
It's not gonna be
the same quaint town.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.541
Are you saying that you
don't want the economic boost

29:00.659 --> 29:04.695
that comes from having big
new stores out on the highway?

29:04.797 --> 29:06.364
Oh, wait.

29:06.465 --> 29:11.602
Not unless it suits
your business, right?

29:11.704 --> 29:13.404
I think you're
a little confused,

29:13.505 --> 29:15.606
and, frankly, out of line.

29:15.708 --> 29:18.443
All in favor
of ending the meeting?

29:18.544 --> 29:20.812
Aye.

29:25.684 --> 29:28.686
You're a dick!

29:29.888 --> 29:31.356
Excuse me?

29:31.440 --> 29:32.740
Yes, I just called you a dick,

29:32.858 --> 29:35.860
because that's what you are!

29:35.944 --> 29:38.229
I'm stuck here now
because I can't sell my property

29:38.330 --> 29:40.281
because of your stupid bypass!

29:40.399 --> 29:42.233
I'm underwater!

29:42.334 --> 29:44.168
No one told me that
before I bought it.

29:44.253 --> 29:46.838
Maybe you should talk about that
at a city council meeting.

29:46.922 --> 29:48.739
Or maybe you should talk about

29:48.841 --> 29:52.043
the fact that your fancy town
is run on drug money.

29:52.127 --> 29:54.545
Maybe that would be worth
talking about as opposed

29:54.630 --> 29:57.298
to crazy house moms whining
about whether or not their kids

29:57.416 --> 30:00.084
have read about ax murderers
and whores.

30:00.185 --> 30:02.053
Welcome to the world, ladies!

30:02.137 --> 30:03.417
There are ax murderers
and whores

30:03.472 --> 30:05.056
stuffed under every rug,

30:05.140 --> 30:06.808
so your kids better read up
on it and get educated,

30:06.925 --> 30:08.309
because that's what life is!

30:08.427 --> 30:10.761
It's a cesspool
you claw and scratch

30:10.863 --> 30:14.265
and fight to swim out of,
but you never get to the top!

30:17.554 --> 30:20.321
As voted,
the meeting is adjourned.

30:50.124 --> 30:53.427
Why'd you want to meet
way out here?

30:53.511 --> 30:55.512
Why all the secrecy?

30:58.800 --> 31:01.435
I heard you talked to Gil.

31:01.519 --> 31:03.720
So what if I did?

31:03.838 --> 31:07.274
That's not smart.

31:07.358 --> 31:11.612
You know what your dad did,
what Gil does.

31:11.696 --> 31:13.280
You need to stay away from him.

31:13.364 --> 31:14.982
You need to stay away
from the whole operation.

31:15.066 --> 31:17.367
As soon as he tells me
who killed my dad.

31:17.485 --> 31:21.021
He's not gonna do that.

31:21.122 --> 31:24.190
- We'll see.
- I think--

31:24.292 --> 31:27.360
I'm pretty sure, actually,

31:27.462 --> 31:31.098
that your dad was sleeping
with Blaire Watson.

31:31.199 --> 31:34.067
That's the "B" that you found
in those letters.

31:34.168 --> 31:38.005
And she also happened
to be Gil's girlfriend.

31:38.089 --> 31:40.641
And when Gil found out,
he wasn't very happy.

31:40.725 --> 31:42.593
Now, I don't know if that's
what happened to your father,

31:42.710 --> 31:45.545
but it's more than likely.

31:45.647 --> 31:47.208
You need to stop
doing what you're doing

31:47.214 --> 31:49.182
and stay the hell out
of all of this.

31:49.267 --> 31:52.102
It's not gonna
bring your dad back,

31:52.219 --> 31:54.605
and it could get you hurt,
or worse.

31:54.722 --> 31:57.407
I like how you're worried
about me all of a sudden.

31:57.525 --> 31:59.576
- It's funny.
- Why is it funny?

31:59.694 --> 32:03.697
Because you didn't answer
any of my emails.

32:05.116 --> 32:06.667
What?

32:06.751 --> 32:09.453
That was about my brother.

32:09.570 --> 32:12.289
He likes you.

32:13.841 --> 32:17.177
There's lines you don't cross.

32:17.262 --> 32:21.298
Whatever.

32:21.415 --> 32:23.634
I'm just trying to help you,
Bradley.

32:23.751 --> 32:26.753
I don't need you to.

32:36.197 --> 32:37.614
Norma!

32:37.732 --> 32:40.067
You scared me.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.202
You shouldn't sneak up
on somebody like that.

32:42.287 --> 32:44.071
I didn't know
walking down the sidewalk

32:44.155 --> 32:46.540
constitutes sneaking up
on somebody.

32:46.624 --> 32:48.208
What do you want?

32:48.293 --> 32:50.460
You all right?

32:50.578 --> 32:52.412
I have been better.

32:52.497 --> 32:55.615
What's the matter?

32:55.717 --> 32:58.552
I, oh--

32:58.636 --> 33:02.339
I am not even gonna go into it.

33:07.061 --> 33:08.182
Well, I wanted to tell you

33:08.295 --> 33:11.315
that Norman
came to see me today.

33:11.432 --> 33:12.516
What for?

33:12.633 --> 33:14.735
He brought me a photo
he took of a man

33:14.819 --> 33:17.137
out at Blaire Watson's grave.

33:17.238 --> 33:18.718
Did you know
he's been going out there

33:18.740 --> 33:21.274
on a regular basis?

33:21.359 --> 33:24.277
I know he's been out there.

33:25.663 --> 33:27.647
I thought
he's gotten over this.

33:27.749 --> 33:32.152
I-I think that...

33:32.253 --> 33:34.254
he's young,
he's impressionable.

33:34.339 --> 33:38.342
Her death hit him very hard.

33:38.459 --> 33:41.178
He and Miss Watson--
I don't even--

33:41.295 --> 33:42.963
I don't even know
her first name.

33:43.047 --> 33:45.465
- Blaire.
- Mm.

33:45.550 --> 33:49.019
She was his advisor.
He really cared about her.

33:49.137 --> 33:50.503
- Yeah, that's what he told me.
- Yeah.

33:50.605 --> 33:53.607
Norman is a very sensitive boy.

33:56.611 --> 33:58.695
Still, you know,
four months after she died,

33:58.813 --> 34:01.347
I-I don't think he should
be hanging out at her grave.

34:01.449 --> 34:03.033
Oh, no,
I totally agree with you.

34:03.151 --> 34:05.569
And he should--he needs
to find some other activities.

34:05.686 --> 34:07.954
- Trust me, I'm working on it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:08.039 --> 34:09.539
- It's summer, just, um...
- Right.

34:09.657 --> 34:11.818
Go let him have some fun,
you know, let him be a kid.

34:11.826 --> 34:13.025
You're right, absolutely.

34:13.127 --> 34:14.710
He should.
He will.

34:25.473 --> 34:27.724
Feels like the hose
is caught on something.

34:27.842 --> 34:29.726
All right, give more slack.
More slack!

34:35.183 --> 34:37.382
- This has got to stop.
- What?

34:37.485 --> 34:39.186
I was just pulled aside
by Romero,

34:39.270 --> 34:40.904
who filled me in on your visit.

34:41.022 --> 34:44.074
What did I do?

34:44.192 --> 34:46.193
I-I didn't do anything wrong.

34:46.277 --> 34:47.444
I saw a suspicious man
at her grave

34:47.561 --> 34:48.482
and went to the police.

34:48.562 --> 34:50.280
Stop it!

34:50.397 --> 34:52.916
Stop it.
This is not sane!

34:53.034 --> 34:54.534
You are obsessed
with that dead woman.

34:54.619 --> 34:55.918
Why?
Why, Norman?

34:56.036 --> 34:59.039
Why are you obsessed
with her death?

35:02.710 --> 35:06.179
I went to her house that night.

35:07.432 --> 35:10.416
What night?

35:10.518 --> 35:12.302
The night she was killed.

35:12.419 --> 35:13.470
But that's not what
you told me.

35:13.587 --> 35:15.522
That's not what you said.

35:15.606 --> 35:17.307
You said that...

35:17.424 --> 35:19.476
she offered you a ride
and that you didn't take it.

35:19.593 --> 35:21.311
That's not what I said!

35:21.428 --> 35:24.030
I said she offered me a ride,
and then I was running home.

35:24.115 --> 35:25.555
But something happened
in the middle.

35:25.566 --> 35:27.267
I-I couldn't tell you.

35:27.368 --> 35:29.236
You'd have been angry,
you know, disappointed in me.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.987
Norman.

35:31.105 --> 35:34.741
Norman, you need to tell me
what happened that night.

35:40.548 --> 35:44.334
She took me to her house
to clean up my eye,

35:44.451 --> 35:46.953
you know, where--
where it had been cut.

35:47.054 --> 35:49.639
And she was nice.
She made me tea.

35:49.757 --> 35:52.342
She talked to me.

35:52.459 --> 35:55.628
But it was, uh...

35:55.730 --> 35:57.230
it was weird.

35:57.315 --> 36:00.484
You know, I felt like...
something was happening,

36:00.601 --> 36:03.353
like she was attracted to me
or something.

36:03.470 --> 36:06.472
And it felt wrong
but also not wrong.

36:11.279 --> 36:13.280
Did you sleep with her?

36:15.482 --> 36:17.534
No.
No, I, uh--

36:17.651 --> 36:21.037
No, she was just gonna drive
me home, but--but, um...

36:21.155 --> 36:22.289
she went and changed

36:22.373 --> 36:24.424
and she left
her bedroom door open,

36:24.509 --> 36:28.712
and I could see her,
you know, undressing.

36:28.829 --> 36:33.300
And I got, uh--I got scared,
I guess, you know?

36:33.384 --> 36:36.970
I-I got, um...

36:37.054 --> 36:40.524
I got, um--

36:40.641 --> 36:44.361
I don't really remember!

36:44.478 --> 36:46.613
I just remember feeling
almost like I was gonna faint,

36:46.697 --> 36:49.399
and then the next thing I know,
I was running home.

36:49.516 --> 36:52.953
I don't remember.

36:53.037 --> 36:54.070
You don't remember
what happened?

36:54.188 --> 36:55.688
No!
No, I've tried!

36:55.790 --> 36:57.523
But all I can think about
is if I hadn't have left,

36:57.625 --> 37:00.627
I might have been there
when that person attacked her,

37:00.711 --> 37:02.312
and I-I might have been able
to help her,

37:02.380 --> 37:04.080
I might have been able
to save her.

37:04.198 --> 37:08.368
I feel like it's my fault,
like I've let her down.

37:10.704 --> 37:13.706
Then why did you leave?

37:19.180 --> 37:21.398
I don't know, mother.

37:27.154 --> 37:30.357
Norman, listen to me.

37:30.441 --> 37:35.445
She tried to seduce you,
and it was not appropriate.

37:35.562 --> 37:39.546
Somewhere inside, you knew that,
and you ran away.

37:39.666 --> 37:41.395
That's it.
It's plain and simple.

37:41.515 --> 37:45.005
You ran away
because you're a good boy.

37:46.147 --> 37:48.331
You're a good boy.

38:23.487 --> 38:25.571
You must like this place.

38:25.656 --> 38:28.941
Can I come in?

38:29.026 --> 38:31.027
Yes, you can.

38:40.704 --> 38:43.289
- You drink yet?
- Please.

38:47.177 --> 38:51.180
So have you thought
about our little talk?

38:55.168 --> 38:57.470
I have.

38:57.554 --> 39:00.556
And I need to know more
about my dad.

39:17.824 --> 39:21.693
Is that what you wanted?

39:21.795 --> 39:24.330
So far, so good.

39:36.309 --> 39:40.312
Not easy being a girl
without a daddy...

39:40.397 --> 39:42.314
you know?

39:44.484 --> 39:46.485
I can imagine.

39:49.055 --> 39:52.658
I just need someone
to explain things to me.

39:54.494 --> 39:56.495
To tell me everything.

40:00.417 --> 40:03.419
Ask away.

40:08.258 --> 40:11.427
I heard my dad
was sleeping with Blaire Watson,

40:11.545 --> 40:14.013
and I need to know more
about my dad,

40:14.097 --> 40:18.350
because I don't think
I ever really knew him.

40:23.356 --> 40:25.357
Take this off.

40:38.488 --> 40:40.656
Was Blaire Watson
sleeping with anyone else?

40:40.773 --> 40:43.492
I don't know, maybe.

40:43.610 --> 40:47.213
Someone who might have
been jealous?

41:12.305 --> 41:14.940
What are you doing?

41:15.025 --> 41:17.276
Did you mean what you said,

41:17.360 --> 41:20.079
that you'd always
be here for me?

41:20.163 --> 41:22.364
Good.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.051
Because I need your help.
