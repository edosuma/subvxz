WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.882
I told you I was seeing someone, Mickey.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.801
You mean, uh, what's his name? Tim?

00:09.884 --> 00:10.844
It's Jim.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.471
Compliments of the kitchen
for the Lincoln Lawyer.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.682
I'm the chef. Lisa.

00:16.307 --> 00:17.976
That's my place right there.

00:19.060 --> 00:19.936
[both moaning]

00:22.105 --> 00:23.732
-[machinery whirring]
-What is that?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.734
The building developer,
Mitchell Bondurant.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.570
He wants to tear the whole block down
and put up high-rises?

00:28.653 --> 00:29.946
And I'm the last holdout.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.615
[Mickey] Well, guys like Bondurant
never play fair.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.784
Ray and I are in the best place
we've been in.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.745
-Your ex?
-She's six months sober. She--

00:36.828 --> 00:37.829
Izzy.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.665
[Lorna] You made me feel like
the smartest person in the class

00:40.749 --> 00:43.418
until you made a pass at me,
and I turned you down.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.963
[Cisco] I've looked into Kaz.
If he's a rat, I ain't seeing it.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.759
[Teddy] Except Kaz got himself
an eight-year bit but only did three.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.136
Maybe Kaz cut a deal.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.306
Either way, you're gonna stay on him.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
Restraining order?

00:57.724 --> 01:01.603
It says I can't go within 300 feet
of Mitchell Bondurant or his business,

01:01.686 --> 01:05.023
but his construction site's
right next to my restaurant and my home.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.608
[cell phone rings]

01:06.691 --> 01:07.692
Mickey Haller.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.402
-[Lisa] Mickey?
-Lisa. Where are you?

01:09.986 --> 01:13.782
[Lisa] They arrested me, Mickey.
They said I killed Mitchell Bondurant.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.033
I'm on my way.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.367
[engine revs]

01:24.459 --> 01:26.461
[suspenseful music playing]

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
Mickey Haller.
I'm here to see my client, Lisa Trammell.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.675
Sit. I'll try the detective.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.928
No, that's not how this works.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.264
Is that right?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.517
Why don't you tell me
how this works, then?

01:41.309 --> 01:43.645
Okay. You're gonna pick up that phone,

01:43.728 --> 01:47.190
and you're gonna call Detective O'Brien
from Robbery-Homicide. Right now.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.528
You'll tell him if I don't see my client
in ten minutes, I'll go see Judge Mills

01:51.611 --> 01:53.863
so you and O'Brien can explain to him

01:53.947 --> 01:58.034
why you stopped a citizen from exercising
her constitutional right to an attorney.

01:58.118 --> 02:02.038
The last time that happened,
he fined the cop 500 bucks.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.665
Wanna see if he'll do it again?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.882
Some asshole lawyer's
down here to see you.

02:14.008 --> 02:14.926
[scoffs] Yeah.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.511
That's the one.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.432
Thanks for the help, Officer.
I know the way.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.352
[elevator dings]

02:25.770 --> 02:27.021
What took you so long?

02:27.105 --> 02:30.400
I had to give your desk sergeant
a lesson in constitutional law.

02:30.483 --> 02:34.529
Well, I'll have to talk to him about that,
but I'm afraid you're too late now.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.407
It's funny. My partner left
to take her down to county

02:37.490 --> 02:39.784
just before I got the call
that you were here.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.661
[hesitates] What a coincidence, huh?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.747
Yeah. So, if you wanna see your client,
you have to go to the jail.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.041
Yeah, which is gonna take two more hours.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.587
The wheels of justice turn slowly,
but they do turn.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.672
Unless…

02:53.882 --> 02:54.966
What?

02:55.049 --> 02:57.135
Something I can help you with, Detective?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.261
Not me.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.139
But my brother-in-law's
in trouble with the IRS.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.475
Personally, I think the guy's a shitbag,
but he's married to my sister.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.519
What can I do? Family.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.064
I want the best for my sister, you know?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.107
Yeah.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.111
I don't do tax cases,
but I know a top-notch guy.

03:15.195 --> 03:19.282
Dan Daly. He's got a full calendar,
but I don't know. I could make a call.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.325
Probably get you in.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.160
You'd do that for me?

03:23.453 --> 03:27.081
Well, look at that.
Lawyers are good for something, after all.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.708
Yeah.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.712
You still in the building? Bring her back.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.466
Of course, Daly's expensive.
All the good ones are. Right?

03:37.634 --> 03:38.760
Unless…

03:39.344 --> 03:40.511
[O'Brien scoffs]

03:40.595 --> 03:43.097
I'm sure I can get you
the friends and family discount.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.432
[O'Brien chuckles]

03:44.515 --> 03:47.810
That would be mighty generous of you.
Mighty generous, indeed.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.648
I assume you guys have the video
of your interrogation of my client.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.026
Well, I'll get it in discovery,
but it would be nice to see it before,

03:55.109 --> 03:56.819
just to see what I'm dealing with.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.739
No problem with that.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.159
You'll see that we stopped talking
to your client

04:03.243 --> 04:06.329
as soon as she mentioned
the magic "lawyer" word.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.082
Wanna tell me why she was even a suspect?

04:09.165 --> 04:10.708
Because she did it.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.544
And she made an admission
before she asked for an attorney.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.505
She admitted killing Mitchell Bondurant?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.006
Maybe not in so many words.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.633
How many exactly?

04:18.716 --> 04:19.717
[O'Brien scoffs]

04:20.260 --> 04:22.971
Christmas is over, Counselor.
And I ain't Santa.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.808
You'll have to get the rest
the old-fashioned way. Shouldn't be long.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.977
They're expediting the arraignment.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.270
[door clicks]

04:35.566 --> 04:37.235
You have about five minutes.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.695
Ho-ho-ho.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.992
I'm gonna call your office
for that tax lawyer's number.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.078
-[handcuffs rattling, clicking]
-Ow. [inhales sharply]

04:54.002 --> 04:55.670
[whispers] Oh, Mickey, thank God.

04:55.753 --> 04:59.215
All right. The cops are watching.
Just sit down and tell me what happened.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.176
[Lisa sighs]

05:04.762 --> 05:07.432
These two detectives came
into the restaurant.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.560
They started asking me questions
about my morning.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.229
-And then the guy--
-O'Brien?

05:13.896 --> 05:16.774
He asked if I'd come down
to the station with him

05:16.858 --> 05:19.527
to answer some questions
about Mitchell Bondurant.

05:20.111 --> 05:25.408
I thought they were finally opening a case
on him because of all my complaints.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.826
So, I said yes.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.038
They didn't say anything
about him being dead.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.873
Did he read you your rights?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.292
Well, only after we got here.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.252
After he said I was under arrest.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.254
Were you handcuffed in the police car?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
No.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.550
Lisa… [clears throat]

05:42.633 --> 05:44.844
…O'Brien said you made some admissions.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.137
What?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.767
That's a lie. I didn't--
I didn't admit to anything.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.311
Mickey, I didn't do this.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.146
I'm not a murderer.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.941
You believe me, right?

05:59.025 --> 06:03.363
Lisa, I'm your attorney right now.
I'll tell you what I tell every client.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.990
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's irrelevant.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.785
Fuck, Mickey. Are you serious?

06:11.120 --> 06:14.290
Let's just focus
on your current situation, all right?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.004
[Lisa exhales deeply]

06:21.005 --> 06:22.548
So, what happens next?

06:23.883 --> 06:27.595
[sighs] You're gonna have to stay
in county jail overnight.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.307
The good news is
your arraignment is tomorrow.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.059
I'll make a motion for bail.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.978
-Any previous arrests?
-No.

06:36.062 --> 06:36.896
Good.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.106
[Lisa sighs]

06:38.815 --> 06:41.859
If the DA files for murder,
the bail will be high,

06:41.943 --> 06:45.154
but your clean record
and standing in the community will help.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.614
I can't afford bail.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.952
I mean, let alone pay you.
I don't have that kind of money.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.122
Well, just don't worry about that
right now, okay?

06:55.456 --> 06:59.043
I'll get you through the bail hearing.
Then we will figure it out.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.212
All right?

07:03.089 --> 07:06.134
Now, Lisa, what I'm about to say
is very important.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.594
Do not talk about your case to anyone.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.473
Don't talk to the detectives
or deputies in the jail or other inmates.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.891
Not even your employees.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.228
I didn't do anything wrong, Mickey.
I'm innocent.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.063
It doesn't matter, Lisa.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.691
-Okay.
-[Mickey] Don't talk to anyone.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.152
That means in the jail phone too.
Calls are recorded.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.195
Just say, "I'm innocent of the charges,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.073
and on the advice of my attorney,
I can't talk about my case."

07:29.157 --> 07:30.908
-Okay.
-[Mickey] Understood?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.743
-Yeah.
-[door clicks]

07:33.536 --> 07:34.412
Time's up.

07:34.996 --> 07:35.830
Let's go.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.084
[handcuffs click]

07:40.168 --> 07:42.753
Remember what I said. It's gonna be okay.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.431
[opening theme music playing]

08:00.438 --> 08:03.608
[Lorna] Oh my God.
That real estate developer got killed.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.318
Mitchell whatever-his-name-is.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.653
-[Mickey] It hit the news?
-Why do you know about this?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.072
The cops arrested Lisa Trammell
for the murder.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.073
[Lorna] Get out!

08:11.157 --> 08:14.035
Oh my God!
Please tell me you're not taking the case.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.663
You two have seen each other naked.
Conflict of interest much? Hello?

08:17.747 --> 08:21.667
As long as our intimate relationship
stays in the past, there's no conflict.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.878
[Lorna] Mickey, I know your MO with women.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.173
Been there, done that.
But this is a whole new level of messy.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.466
[Mickey] It's not ideal,

08:28.549 --> 08:30.510
but this is a high-profile case, Lorna.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.053
I have to entertain it.

08:32.136 --> 08:36.057
Let's see what Cisco can get first.
And find out if a DA's been assigned yet.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.892
[Lorna] So you're gonna take the case.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.268
I haven't decided yet.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.438
Fine, but I want my objection noted
for the record.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.648
Yeah. So noted.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.651
You have Hayley's riding lesson
in Griffith Park in 30 minutes.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.152
Right. On my way.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.987
-[lively jazz music playing]
-[quietly] Shit.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.781
-[engine revs]
-[tires squealing]

08:57.328 --> 08:58.538
[cell phone chimes]

09:07.880 --> 09:09.006
"Sunland."

09:10.925 --> 09:12.426
[line rings]

09:14.804 --> 09:16.305
-Babes.
-[Lorna] Hey.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.058
Mickey wants you to do some
digging for him. Where are you?

09:19.141 --> 09:24.313
Uh, I'm at the, uh, Harley store.
I had to get brake pads for my bike.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.898
In Glendale?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.609
Yep, uh, but I can be there in 30.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.736
Text me the info. I'll jump right on it.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.905
-Okay, I'll see you soon.
-[Cisco] Yeah.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.368
[Maggie] I was hoping to
see her ride today.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.538
[Mickey] Thursday is just the basics.
Saddling, bridling.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.041
She has to earn the horse's trust
before she can ride him.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.129
[Maggie] Your mom told her stories
about you riding at your uncle's ranch.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.714
Got her really excited about it.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.883
Yeah, well, she'll be a natural.
Runs in the family.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.720
We have a magic touch with horses.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.680
Oh, is that what it is?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.141
Not just horses, I'd say.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.852
What did I do now?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.230
Explain this to me.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.900
The DA is reopening a case
on your client Jesús Menendez

10:09.984 --> 10:15.239
until the actual killer,
who happens to be another client of yours,

10:15.323 --> 10:19.577
is caught trying to attack a woman,
who happens to be another client of yours.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.496
That has Mickey Haller
written all over it, no?

10:22.580 --> 10:26.125
Maggie, I told you I needed those cops
watching Glory Days

10:26.208 --> 10:29.420
because she was giving up info
on Hector Moya.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.756
Jesús just got a lucky break, that's all.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.467
You played me for Hector Moya.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.636
Lucky for you, it worked out.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.180
Did you use it to get your case back?

10:39.764 --> 10:40.723
Yeah.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.142
-Ah, see? Everybody wins.
-[chuckles]

10:44.393 --> 10:47.104
So, uh, how are things with Tim?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.022
Kidding.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.941
[strained] Things are fine.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.320
Trouble in paradise?

10:54.403 --> 10:57.782
No, it's complicated.

10:58.324 --> 11:03.037
I don't know. This whole dating…
It's hard with work and kids and…

11:05.498 --> 11:07.708
What about you? Anyone new in your life?

11:08.834 --> 11:10.920
Well, it's-- It's complicated.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.719
Well, I should get back to work.
Thanks for taking Hayley home.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.054
Yeah, of course.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.181
-Hayley!
-Bye, Mom.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.893
And thanks for picking up the slack
on these lessons.

11:25.976 --> 11:31.065
Maybe next time I'll see you on a horse.
Cowboy boots, Stetson, maybe some chaps.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.567
Well, if I knew that was a turn-on…

11:33.651 --> 11:35.528
[laughs] I'll see you, Mickey.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.530
Bye, Maggie.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.870
Looking good, Hayley.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.456
[pensive music playing]

11:57.633 --> 12:01.303
[O'Brien] So, can you tell me again
where you were this morning?

12:02.513 --> 12:03.806
Okay. [sighs]

12:03.889 --> 12:06.559
I, um, I was having breakfast,

12:07.268 --> 12:10.771
then I got a call from the fishmonger
at the farmers market.

12:11.272 --> 12:15.735
I headed down there around 9:00,
and I picked up my fish, and, uh…

12:17.111 --> 12:19.613
And then I walked over
to Café Maurice's for coffee.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.158
[O'Brien] Café Maurice.
That's on Wilshire?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.702
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.622
That's by Mitchell Bondurant's office.
Did you stop there?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.208
No.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.045
Is that what this is about?

12:36.797 --> 12:39.675
So, if someone said they saw you there,
they'd be lying?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.929
[Lisa] I didn't violate
the restraining order.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.975
[O'Brien] Did you see Bondurant today?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.192
Yes, I saw him.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.198
[O'Brien] But you didn't go to his office.
Did you see him in the garage?

13:02.281 --> 13:04.617
[Lisa] No, I've never been to his garage.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.537
He was in line at the coffee shop, okay?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.165
There's always a line out the door
at that place.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.251
And the second I saw him,
I hightailed out of there.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.254
So, if he's telling you he saw me,
he's lying.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.675
Which doesn't surprise me,
'cause he's a pathological fucking liar.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.680
-[O'Brien] Why didn't you tell us before?
-[Lisa] You didn't ask.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.391
Honestly, Bondurant's a pig.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.851
[quietly] Shit.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.438
[Lisa] You should be investigating him
for his building violations.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.317
And really, just for being
an all-around shitty human.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.862
Ms. Trammell, did you attack
Mitchell Bondurant today?

13:41.946 --> 13:42.905
What?

13:44.281 --> 13:45.616
Someone attacked him?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.327
Honestly, it doesn't surprise me.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.039
There's a long list of people
who'd love to take a shot at that guy.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.415
Right.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.878
According to you, he's a pathological liar
and an all-around shitty human.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.713
So maybe you're one of those people.

14:01.006 --> 14:05.135
[scoffs] Look, I hate the guy.
I'm not gonna sugarcoat--

14:05.219 --> 14:06.720
[O'Brien] Hate him enough to kill him?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.561
I want my lawyer.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.938
Mickey Haller.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.649
[somber music playing]

14:20.484 --> 14:21.777
[exhales slowly]

14:25.948 --> 14:26.949
[elevator dings]

14:35.416 --> 14:36.667
[woman] Can you hold that?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.213
Haller.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.424
Morning, Andrea.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.388
A little birdie told me
you're on the Trammell case.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.308
You're the DA?

14:54.602 --> 14:57.646
I'm just, uh,
handling the arraignment for now.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.108
Yeah. I'd think twice
about doing this case, too, if I were you.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.361
I've beat you so many times
I've lost count.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.321
[chuckles] Okay.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.198
What was the name
of that drug dealer you represented?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.912
The, um, McGinley guy.
Darius McGinley. How's he doing?

15:12.995 --> 15:16.373
I know he's doing seven years
up in Corcoran, but…

15:16.957 --> 15:19.710
You put a professional snitch
on the stand, Andrea.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.253
Guy was lying through his teeth.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.882
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I do know your guy was guilty.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.510
-That's not the point.
-I'm sorry, that is exactly the point.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.555
[scoffs] No wonder
you and Maggie are exes.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.682
[elevator chimes]

15:33.766 --> 15:34.642
[chuckles]

15:34.725 --> 15:38.395
I must be in your head a lot if you spend
so much time talking to Maggie about me.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.273
You wish, Haller. [scoffs]

15:43.108 --> 15:44.151
[Andrea sighs]

15:44.234 --> 15:48.238
I barely even talk to Maggie anymore
since you got her booted to Van Nuys.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.074
-Oh, since I--
-Yeah.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.700
She gets sent to Siberia,

15:51.784 --> 15:55.204
and you get famous
for setting a wife-killer free.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.082
Shapiro, Kardashian, Haller.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.043
-You must be so proud.
-Yeah.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.213
I defended my client
and got him a not-guilty verdict.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.799
-[elevator chimes]
-Last time I checked, that's the job.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.179
You know, you choose
high-profile clients for a reason.

16:12.262 --> 16:16.266
You love all eyes being trained on you
and only you.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.436
But, like I said,
I'd think twice about this one.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.189
See you in there.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.732
[reporters shouting]

16:23.816 --> 16:25.901
-[cameras clicking]
-[male reporter] There he is! Sir!

16:25.985 --> 16:27.403
Please give me one question.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.155
Mr. Haller, what is your involvement
in the Bondurant case?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.033
Are you representing Lisa Trammell?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.035
[suspenseful music playing]

16:35.119 --> 16:37.329
[sighs] Yes, I am.
And I can tell you this.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.456
My client is innocent of these charges.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.500
And the People have no case.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.836
I look forward
to demonstrating that in court.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.671
So thank you. No more questions.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.256
[reporters all talk at once]

16:47.339 --> 16:49.717
What? A little press
is good for business, Lorna.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.802
Let me guess.
She brought up Darius McGinley.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.886
Yes, she did.

16:52.970 --> 16:53.971
Predictable.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.640
[muted chatter]

16:59.351 --> 17:01.020
[door opens]

17:03.355 --> 17:05.274
-[reporters clamoring]
-[cameras clicking]

17:07.776 --> 17:08.694
[Mickey] You okay?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.778
[Judge] Order.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.780
[chatter fades]

17:13.866 --> 17:15.034
Mr. Haller.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.536
Your Honor. Always a pleasure.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.079
I wish I could say the same.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.042
I pushed this to the top of the docket
to accommodate the media,

17:23.125 --> 17:26.003
who I want out of my courtroom ASAP.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.674
So, Ms. Freemann, in the famous words
of Beyoncé, "move, move, move, move."

17:31.717 --> 17:35.262
Your Honor, the People
charge Lisa Marie Trammell,

17:35.345 --> 17:37.556
under Penal Code 187A,

17:37.639 --> 17:39.391
with the first-degree murder,

17:39.475 --> 17:43.062
unlawfully and with malice aforethought,
of Mitchell Bondurant.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.773
The People further charge
that said murder was committed

17:45.856 --> 17:48.609
with the special circumstance
of lying in wait.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.319
How does the defendant plead?

17:50.402 --> 17:51.695
Not guilty, Your Honor.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.655
Look at that. Like clockwork.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.743
Anything else before I call a recess
so the press can skedaddle

17:57.826 --> 17:59.828
and peace can return to my house?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.331
We'd like to schedule
a prelim setting for tomorrow

18:02.414 --> 18:03.916
and to make a motion for bail.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.001
This is a special circumstance murder.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
Per the schedule, there is no bail.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.715
And the People would strenuously object
to any deviation from that.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.927
Ms. Trammell is a danger to the community
and a potential flight risk.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.722
Ms. Trammell owns a restaurant
with over 30 employees who depend on her.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.849
Far from being a danger to her community,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.560
she is the heart and soul of it
and has no intentions of fleeing.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.562
Look at all the people here
to support her.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.606
-[supporters cheering]
-[Judge] Oh, no!

18:27.689 --> 18:29.691
That will not fly in my courtroom.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.195
One more sound and I clear the room.

18:33.278 --> 18:37.533
Judge, the defense would like
to paint his client as some folk hero,

18:38.242 --> 18:39.701
but that doesn't change the fact

18:39.785 --> 18:42.955
that the victim filed
a temporary restraining order against her.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.623
This is a dangerous individual.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.626
I've heard enough.
We're splitting the difference.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.170
Bail will be set at two million dollars.

18:50.254 --> 18:54.258
We'll reconvene here tomorrow
to schedule a preliminary hearing.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.971
Unless we can make this go away,
maybe with a plea.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.685
Well, I tried. [sighs]
Okay, if there's nothing else.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.145
[Mickey clears throat]

19:09.106 --> 19:10.399
Two million dollars?

19:11.024 --> 19:13.735
We can put it up in collateral.
The restaurant?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.362
Absolutely not.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.614
It's all I have in the world.
I can't do that.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.493
All right. Well, I'll hook you up
with a bail bondsman,

19:21.577 --> 19:22.870
but it's gonna cost you 10%.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.873
You think I have 200 grand
lying around, Mickey?

19:26.748 --> 19:27.958
[Lisa sighs]

19:29.418 --> 19:33.297
I hate to ask this, Mickey,
but is there any way you could--

19:33.380 --> 19:36.967
I can't do that, Lisa.
It's a major conflict of interest.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.386
I'd have to withdraw as your lawyer.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.141
Look, I have an idea.
Your case is getting a ton of press.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.144
I can try to sell your life rights
to a production company.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.856
It's up to you, but I'd manage the process
so you're portrayed in a good light.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.775
I'm not really worried about
how I'm portrayed, Mickey.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.988
I need the money.
I-I can't spend another night in jail.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.823
It's gonna take time, Lisa.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.242
And it still may not be enough
to cover bail.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.037
You'll have to cobble it together
with savings.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.496
How am I gonna pay you?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.499
All right. This, uh--

20:10.125 --> 20:14.296
This document gives me power of attorney
to negotiate the sale of your life rights.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.424
And this is a lien on any income derived
from that sale.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.468
So when you get paid, I get paid.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.886
And what if I don't get paid?

20:20.969 --> 20:24.514
Let's not worry about that right now.
Sooner I start making calls, the better.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.766
[bailiff] Please stand.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.976
Keep thinking I'll wake up
from this nightmare.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.312
Right now, I need you to be strong, okay?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.482
-Remember, don't talk to anyone.
-[handcuffs click]

20:35.400 --> 20:37.402
[pensive music playing]

20:39.321 --> 20:40.989
Are you sure this is a good idea?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.158
No, but I'm doing it anyway.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.285
We're not gonna lose.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.958
[cell phone chimes]

20:54.711 --> 20:55.879
[Lorna groans]

20:56.672 --> 20:57.547
What's up?

20:57.631 --> 21:01.385
I've gotten two weird credit card alerts
for some gas station in Sunland.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.680
-I don't know where Sunland is.
-Do you share that card with Cisco?

21:04.763 --> 21:07.683
Yeah, but yesterday I got an alert,
and I called Cisco,

21:07.766 --> 21:09.184
and he said he was in Glendale.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.063
And today, he told me
he's meeting with his new LAPD source, so…

21:13.146 --> 21:14.731
[Izzy] It's probably fraud.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.442
I had a guy try
to charge tickets to Thailand on my card.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.278
Can I ask you a question?

21:21.738 --> 21:24.574
-You think Cisco could be cheating on me?
-Cisco?

21:25.534 --> 21:27.119
Hell no.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.248
Trust me. That man thanks sweet baby Jesus
every morning he wakes up to you.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.959
[chuckles softly] Right? Yeah. It's just…

21:34.584 --> 21:38.005
You know, there's been really weird stuff
with him lately.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.466
It feels like
he's been sneaking around a lot and…

21:42.217 --> 21:43.468
[grunts]

21:43.552 --> 21:46.179
I'll look up this gas station.
That's not snooping, right?

21:46.263 --> 21:47.931
Not technically.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.059
Okay.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.939
Huh.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.483
The Patch.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.526
[Izzy] What?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.987
It's an old Road Saints hang.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.406
So Cisco hung out with his boys.
No big deal.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.367
Yes, a big deal.
He told me he was all through with that.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.286
Well, maybe it's something for Mickey.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.747
He represents them.
I've driven him to the clubhouse.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.082
If it is, then I don't know about it.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.500
Okay.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.503
Why don't you just ask Cisco what's up?

22:18.587 --> 22:22.924
I could, but it's not that easy.
He's obviously hiding something from me.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.429
And if it's not cheating, now I'm worried
he's getting back into the biker life.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.599
And I'm scared I won't like the answer
if I actually get it.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.851
Maybe I should
because we are getting married.

22:32.934 --> 22:36.104
And you can't start a marriage
without all the trust.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.525
And honesty is the cornerstone
of every romantic relationship.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.820
Well, that and sex,
but we have that part covered.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.908
So, you know what? You are so right.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.370
I should just ask him.
I'm gonna rip that Band-Aid off.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.330
That is such good advice, Izzy.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.000
You know you monologued
to yourself, right?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.668
Oh. Sorry.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.420
Don't worry about it.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.882
I'm not the right person
to be giving relationship advice anyway.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.344
You know, you might not have noticed,

23:07.427 --> 23:10.722
but I was a little hard on you
when you first started working for Mickey.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.224
[sarcastically] You don't say.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.102
I'm really sorry about that.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.232
That's okay.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.194
I would have been, too,
if I were in your shoes.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.197
-Thanks for snooping with me.
-Anytime.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.740
[pensive music playing]

23:30.534 --> 23:32.869
-Hey, you wanna grab dinner?
-Uh…

23:33.578 --> 23:34.996
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:36.331 --> 23:40.419
Let's go somewhere Mickey's wanted to go
and make him really jealous. My treat.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.336
[Izzy] Sold.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.714
That man loves to eat.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.800
[upbeat music playing]

23:53.807 --> 23:59.187
Hi. Um, can I have the beef curry
and the octopus dumplings, please?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.649
[vendor] I'm sorry. Somebody just got
the last order of the octopus dumplings.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.609
Oh, really? All right--

24:04.693 --> 24:06.111
Guess I beat you to them.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.533
[chuckles] Okay. Just the beef curry
and a sparkling water, please.

24:11.616 --> 24:12.451
[vendor] Sure.

24:12.951 --> 24:13.994
Fifteen dollars.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.329
Here. That's fine.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.081
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.584
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.045
I should have known I'd run into you.
You love your food routines, Haller.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.714
Oh, I sound so boring.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.924
No mystery. No excitement.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.594
Nah, excitement was never your problem.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.845
[vendor] Order 122.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.181
-Yeah, thank you.
-[vendor] Enjoy.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.099
[Mickey] Taking food home to Hayley?

24:36.183 --> 24:38.894
No, she's at a friend's house.
I'm eating by myself tonight.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.856
Oh. Well, mine's gonna take a minute.
You wanna sit down and eat?

24:42.939 --> 24:44.774
Trying to get at my dumplings?

24:44.858 --> 24:46.693
Are we still talking food, or…

24:46.776 --> 24:48.111
[Maggie laughs]

24:55.160 --> 24:58.788
Let me tell you what.
Why don't you have one while you wait?

25:00.415 --> 25:03.710
I mean, it's only fair.
You introduced me to this place.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.838
Maybe I should have given it to you
in the divorce.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.216
We share a kid.
We can share a food truck, no?

25:09.299 --> 25:10.509
[chuckles]

25:12.719 --> 25:14.346
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

25:16.932 --> 25:17.891
[Maggie] Mm.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.062
-Oh, it's so good.
-So good.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.396
-Right?
-Mm.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.360
[cell phone chimes]

25:31.947 --> 25:32.781
Oh.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.951
What now? Jim wants
to get into my dumplings too?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.035
[Maggie chuckles]

25:37.118 --> 25:41.873
No. We're supposed to meet for a drink,
but he's, um, finished his meeting early.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.962
[sighs] And given that my schedule
has been so tough, I should…

25:49.172 --> 25:51.675
Right. Well, don't stick around for me. I…

25:52.676 --> 25:53.718
You should go.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.097
You want the rest?

25:57.180 --> 25:59.057
Ah, I won't say no to that.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.646
It was nice running into you.

26:05.772 --> 26:06.773
Night.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.942
Night, Maggie.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.489
[vendor] Order 123.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.621
-Here you go. Have a good night.
-Thank you.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.087
That new source at the LAPD came through.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.589
Get this.

26:30.672 --> 26:35.760
Bondurant was found dead next to his car
in the parking garage of his office.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.678
You're kidding.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.138
Statistically speaking,

26:38.221 --> 26:41.182
10% of crimes
occur in parking lots or garages.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.976
I only park on the street now.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.311
Dog thefts are up too.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.895
Oh, I've got pepper spray.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.315
You come for Winston,
you are coming for me.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.775
-[Izzy laughs]
-Can we get back to the case, please?

26:51.943 --> 26:54.613
-Bondurant was hit on the top of the head?
-[Cisco] Mm-hmm.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.490
Cause of death was hemorrhaging
from blunt force trauma.

26:57.574 --> 27:01.328
The wound looks circular.
Was anything recovered at the scene?

27:01.411 --> 27:06.541
Yeah. Uh, there was a coffee cup
from down the street at Café Maurice.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.420
And a shard of mirrored glass,
maybe from a car.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.256
-But both his car mirrors were intact.
-[Lorna] Hmm.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.884
So, no murder weapon,
which means it's still out there.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.470
-That's good for us?
-As long as it never shows up.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.388
I'm saving the worst for last.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.723
They've got a witness

27:21.806 --> 27:25.143
who saw Lisa Trammell
walking away from Bondurant's office.

27:25.226 --> 27:28.647
A receptionist at his company
by the name of Margo Schafer.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.775
-Can she place her in the garage?
-There was no mention of that.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.861
Look into the witness.
Find out what you can about her.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.696
Won't you get all this in discovery?

27:36.780 --> 27:39.366
Eventually. Andrea plays
fast and loose with the rules.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.992
Ha! Who does that remind you of?

27:41.076 --> 27:44.079
She'll sit on things as long as she can.
We have to force her hand.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.791
Which means you're gonna get
your first clinic assignment.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.751
Unless you just wanna be snarky.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.044
No snark.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.297
Will I be writing a motion
to compel discovery?

27:54.381 --> 27:56.841
-You think you can handle it?
-Yes! I can handle it.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.885
That cheater is not gonna know
what hit her.

27:58.968 --> 28:00.095
That's my girl.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.268
All right. Uh, Cisco, what did you do…

28:09.062 --> 28:10.939
Hey. Did you talk to him yet?

28:11.022 --> 28:13.858
Haven't had a chance.
And with this motion, it'll have to wait.

28:13.942 --> 28:14.943
[woman] Knock-knock.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.362
[Lorna] Uh, Mickey.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.240
[Mickey] Oh. Lisa?

28:20.323 --> 28:22.992
What are you doing here?
How did you get out of county?

28:23.076 --> 28:25.829
My friend Henry put up the bond for me.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.664
-Henry.
-Yeah, that's me.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.249
Henry Dahl. Nice to meet you.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.042
[Lisa] Henry's a podcast producer.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.754
He interviewed me a few months back
for a story about gentrification.

28:34.838 --> 28:35.797
[Mickey] Podcasts?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.507
You might've heard of
Murder on the Hudson.

28:37.590 --> 28:41.136
It was in The New York Times' top 10
for three months. It was a huge hit.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.971
-No.
-Oh.

28:43.054 --> 28:47.016
When I heard Lisa had been arrested,
I knew that I had to step in and help.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.477
I know her.
There's no way that she did this.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.146
Very supportive of you.

28:51.229 --> 28:55.984
Henry says he can reedit the old material
as a true-crime story.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.988
You know all those podcasts
they turn into docuseries in a TV show?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.282
I'll be able to get enough money
to pay you

29:02.365 --> 29:05.827
and maybe even have some cash left over
for my restaurant.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.871
Henry has buyers lined up already.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.039
-[Mickey] Is that right?
-[Henry] That is right.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.376
Well, Lisa, I'm--
[clears throat] I'm glad you're out.

29:13.460 --> 29:17.088
You should go home. Get some rest.
We have a long road ahead of us.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.592
Izzy, you mind ordering a car service
to take Lisa home, please?

29:20.675 --> 29:22.969
-Yup.
-No. That's okay. Henry gave me a lift.

29:23.052 --> 29:26.556
I actually have to talk to Henry.
Some contract stuff, if you don't mind?

29:26.639 --> 29:28.057
Uh, yeah, sure.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.272
Henry, thanks again.

29:34.856 --> 29:35.690
Of course.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.192
Stay strong.

29:37.859 --> 29:38.902
[chuckles softly]

29:39.486 --> 29:41.863
Seen that show about the vegan
who's swindled by her boyfriend

29:41.946 --> 29:43.156
and loses her restaurant?

29:43.740 --> 29:44.616
No.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.619
I thought because
it's about a restaurant, that…

29:51.414 --> 29:53.458
-I'm gonna work on that motion.
-Mm-hmm.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.088
You're not gonna stuff me in there,
are you?

30:01.382 --> 30:03.510
This is why they call you
the Lincoln Lawyer.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.595
You'll make a great character
in the series.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.431
I'm not gonna be a character
in your series, Henry.

30:09.557 --> 30:10.475
What is this?

30:10.558 --> 30:14.354
That's the power of attorney Lisa signed
to negotiate the sale of her life rights

30:15.063 --> 30:17.774
and a lien on any income derived
from that sale.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.275
It's all dated yesterday.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.237
Supersedes whatever bullshit agreement
you have with her.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.406
[stammers] What's your angle, huh?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.783
What are you talking about?

30:26.866 --> 30:30.119
You just shelled out 200 grand
for someone you hardly know.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.038
That's too good to be true.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.957
Where did you get the money, Henry?

30:34.040 --> 30:37.961
You have no idea
how lucrative podcasts can be, do you?

30:38.044 --> 30:40.129
I know a con man when I see one.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.047
A con man?

30:41.631 --> 30:43.132
I'll get you copies of these.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.342
But understand this.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.928
I control the sale of Lisa's story,
not you.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.304
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.139
I got a question. What's your angle?

30:50.223 --> 30:54.686
Representing my client and getting paid
for my legal services. In that order.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.480
Look. We don't have to
be enemies here, Mickey.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.650
Right? We both want the same thing.
We can work together.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.611
There's no "we," Henry.
I don't know you, and I don't trust you.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.655
I want you far away from this case.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.533
And don't film or record Lisa.
It's very bad for her defense.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.953
Hold on. The whole point of this
is to get Lisa's story in real-time.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.163
Yeah, not my concern. You have a good day.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.249
[upbeat music playing]

31:17.000 --> 31:18.418
[vehicle starts]

31:26.175 --> 31:27.343
[Mickey] Heels down.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.512
There it is.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.350
[horse whinnies]

31:44.485 --> 31:46.946
[cell phone rings]

31:47.906 --> 31:50.283
-Hey, Mick, aren't you with Hayley?
-Yeah, I am.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.245
Can you take a look
at the Bondurant crime scene photos?

31:54.329 --> 31:55.204
Uh-huh.

31:55.955 --> 31:56.915
How's she doing?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.083
[Mickey] Ah, so far, so good.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.002
-Maybe she'll stick with this.
-Doubt it.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.588
At her age,
I went from collecting Lisa Frank stickers

32:03.671 --> 32:07.175
to captain of the color guard to the back
of Mark Rambler's car in two years.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.636
Yeah, well,
I'll light a candle to some saint.

32:09.719 --> 32:10.678
You find the photos?

32:10.762 --> 32:11.888
Yeah. What do you need?

32:11.971 --> 32:14.390
Can you estimate
how tall Mitchell Bondurant was?

32:14.474 --> 32:17.226
No, but I bet I could find it online.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.815
Yeah, here he is
with half the city council.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.109
He's taller than all of them. Maybe 6'3''?

32:25.193 --> 32:26.736
6'3". All right, thank you.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.279
-What did you--
-[line beeps]

32:29.030 --> 32:30.531
Sometimes he's just rude.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.368
You look great out there, mija.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.535
Thank you.

32:36.412 --> 32:39.832
You keep taking lessons,
maybe we can talk about a horse.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.668
It's expensive, Dad.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.419
Let me worry about that.

32:43.503 --> 32:47.298
What's the point of working all the time
if I can't do what I want for my family?

32:47.799 --> 32:48.800
Yeah.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.010
Is that your new case
you were talking about?

32:51.678 --> 32:52.845
Yeah.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.848
Must be big.
Your forehead gets all scrunched up.

32:55.932 --> 32:56.849
Yeah.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.852
Well, it's a murder case.
They're always big.

33:00.645 --> 33:04.232
Plus, I'm going up against this prosecutor
who doesn't play fair.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.067
Who, Andy?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.487
Yeah. She's kind of intense.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.073
-"Andy"?
-Yeah.

33:12.782 --> 33:16.744
She and Mom go to yoga together.
Sometimes she comes over after.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.705
She was talking about it the other night.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.165
It sounds crazy.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.835
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.839
All right. I'm gonna go get my stuff,
but I'll see you.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.298
Yeah. I'll wait here.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.299
[Hayley] Okay.

33:32.719 --> 33:33.928
[line rings]

33:34.012 --> 33:35.888
-[cell phone rings]
-[she groans]

33:35.972 --> 33:38.975
Mickey, if you keep calling me,
I'm never gonna finish this motion.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.477
That's why I'm calling.
We're gonna need more motions.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.562
More?

33:42.645 --> 33:45.356
Write up a motion
to get Lisa Trammell's cell phone returned

33:45.440 --> 33:47.942
and one to get her personal items
seized from her house.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.737
They'll be returned
as soon as we're finished.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.905
[Mickey] We need it faster than that.
Just do it.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.241
Write another one
to suppress her police interview

33:55.324 --> 33:57.618
and one to suppress evidence
seized from her place.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.536
Okay?

33:58.619 --> 34:02.457
Mickey, no judge in their right mind
will throw the evidence in a murder trial.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.000
Not if they wanna get reelected.

34:04.083 --> 34:07.170
Listen, I know it's a ton of work,
but trust me, it's important.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.839
No, no. I'm on it.
I'm excited. Is that weird?

34:09.922 --> 34:12.550
I'm genuinely excited
to write long-winded legal documents.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.135
Okay, don't call me anymore. Bye.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.345
[line beeps]

34:18.639 --> 34:20.641
[suspenseful music playing]

34:33.321 --> 34:34.572
[yawns quietly]

34:43.831 --> 34:45.291
…and willful…

34:45.374 --> 34:47.376
[indistinct muttering]

35:01.182 --> 35:03.267
[Winston snoring]

35:20.159 --> 35:21.327
[groans]

35:21.410 --> 35:22.537
I'm up, I'm up!

35:23.037 --> 35:26.207
Oh God. No more coffee. Wait. Never mind.

35:28.334 --> 35:29.168
Court suit.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.419
[Lorna moans happily]

35:31.170 --> 35:32.338
You do love me.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.342
[Winston whines]

35:38.928 --> 35:40.012
You do, right?

35:41.055 --> 35:42.014
What?

35:42.098 --> 35:43.015
Love me.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.059
Babe.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.353
Come on.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.858
You never have to ask.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.323
What's going on with you?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.660
You're acting weird.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.121
I'm not the one who's been acting weird.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.874
You've been keeping secrets from me.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.336
What have you been doing hanging out
with the Road Saints?

36:13.337 --> 36:18.259
Look, I don't wanna jump to conclusions,
and I wanna be that really cool chick

36:18.342 --> 36:20.887
who gives you space
outside of the relationship

36:20.970 --> 36:22.346
to have friends, but…

36:22.430 --> 36:26.350
These, like, particular friends
are actually criminals, so…

36:26.934 --> 36:29.145
It's just not you anymore, Cisco.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.479
It's making me think

36:30.563 --> 36:33.274
that maybe you're having second thoughts
about the wedding.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.276
I know. I'm sorry. I'm monologuing again.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.988
I am not having second thoughts
about the wedding.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.036
But I have been keeping stuff from you.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.121
What?

36:47.663 --> 36:48.539
Why?

36:50.082 --> 36:52.585
Remember I told you about
when I first came to LA?

36:52.668 --> 36:55.713
Yeah, you came out
with your friend Jazzy or Pez.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.465
-[chuckles] Kaz.
-Yeah.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.091
Pete Kazinski.

37:00.134 --> 37:05.014
I didn't come with him.
More so, I followed him.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.517
Ever since I was 14, I followed him.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.769
And he's in prison now.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.270
Uh, he was.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.564
He just got out.

37:14.523 --> 37:18.527
But it was Kaz who first joined
the Road Saints when he got out here.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.821
He's how I got into the club.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.617
This one time,

37:24.700 --> 37:28.287
Kaz and I were meant to go
on a run for a delivery.

37:29.538 --> 37:33.668
Of what, I didn't ask,
but Kaz told me where and when.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.754
When I showed up, nobody was there.

37:39.298 --> 37:43.302
Turns out he'd given me
the wrong info intentionally.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.389
-If I'd have been there--
-You would've gone away with him.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.183
He protected you.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.188
That's when I started drifting away
from the Road Saints.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.940
And now he's out?

37:56.899 --> 37:58.442
Yeah, that's the thing.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.195
He got paroled early.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.615
Which made Teddy suspicious.

38:05.449 --> 38:10.121
He thinks Kaz cut a deal to be a rat,
and now he wants me to suss him out.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.499
What does any of this have to do with you?

38:14.792 --> 38:15.793
[Cisco sighs]

38:15.876 --> 38:19.046
Well, you can't just leave a club
like the Saints.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.383
I had hoped,
because I was only an associate,

38:22.466 --> 38:25.177
they'd forget about me, let me slide.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.596
But it turns out they didn't.

38:29.015 --> 38:32.101
Mickey was giving them free work
to pay off my debt.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.062
Otherwise… [exhales]

38:35.771 --> 38:38.274
I told Teddy that I pay my own debts.

38:38.357 --> 38:42.611
I owe that, but I also owe Kaz
for saving my ass.

38:43.237 --> 38:47.283
I hate this for you, Cisco. I don't--
I don't want you involved in this.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.785
I just gotta finish this one thing,

38:50.661 --> 38:52.705
and then I'm done, I promise.

38:53.998 --> 38:59.795
I'm sorry that I kept stuff from you,
and I never want you to worry.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.547
No more secrets.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.009
You lie to me again, and I'm out.
Do you hear me?

39:06.427 --> 39:07.386
No more.

39:08.763 --> 39:09.805
Scout's honor.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.572
Look at all that beautiful paperwork.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.785
I knew that law school education
would pay off.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.370
[he chuckles]

39:33.371 --> 39:35.706
Speaking of no more secrets,

39:36.582 --> 39:40.753
I never told you why I left law school
the first time, did I?

39:42.797 --> 39:44.465
Apparently not.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.553
[Lorna groans]

40:03.401 --> 40:05.027
Can I have a word with you?

40:05.653 --> 40:06.654
Sure.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.448
What's going on?

40:09.532 --> 40:11.117
I have the same question.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.872
What are you doing? You know Judge Medina
is gonna deny all these motions.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.544
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
There's one more. Give me one second.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.172
Wait. Another motion?

40:25.256 --> 40:26.841
Yeah. I wrote this one myself.

40:26.924 --> 40:27.800
Who is this?

40:28.634 --> 40:30.469
Uh, she's my paralegal.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.430
Yeah. Don't worry about her.

40:32.930 --> 40:36.350
I think it's clear. It's a motion
to have you dismissed from this case.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.227
You have a conflict of interest.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.146
What conflict of interest?

40:40.229 --> 40:43.441
Well, you discussed this case
with my ex-wife, Andy.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.777
I can call you Andy, right?
I mean, my daughter does.

40:47.862 --> 40:51.615
Maggie is a fellow prosecutor.
I'm allowed to discuss cases with her.

40:51.699 --> 40:55.369
Not ones that involve me.
Not in her house in front of my daughter.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.372
-This is bullshit.
-Yeah? Then why'd you lie to me?

40:59.457 --> 41:02.960
-I never lied. What are you talking about?
-I asked you if you talk to Maggie.

41:03.043 --> 41:06.088
You said barely.
Feels to me like you're hiding something.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.674
You think this is gonna work?

41:09.341 --> 41:11.594
It's the appearance of impropriety.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.138
You're right about the judge
denying all my motions.

41:14.221 --> 41:15.806
But she'll feel so bad

41:15.890 --> 41:19.643
about not giving the defense anything
that she'll grant this one.

41:19.727 --> 41:23.355
After all, why would the court care
which prosecutor is on the case?

41:23.981 --> 41:29.737
But you care 'cause you want this case.
You love all eyes trained on you too.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.574
What do you want?

41:33.657 --> 41:35.618
I want discovery flowing now, not later.

41:35.701 --> 41:39.246
I don't wanna go to the judge every time
I don't get something I'm entitled to.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.749
Fine. Withdraw your motions.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.918
I'll have everything to you by Friday.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.461
Mm, not good enough. Tomorrow.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.755
[Andrea] Not enough time
to copy everything.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.590
All right. Thursday, by noon.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.592
Fine.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.553
Thank you for being so reasonable, Andy.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.722
-Haller.
-Yeah?

41:56.805 --> 41:59.433
Just so you know,
there will not be a plea offer.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.143
Good. 'Cause we don't want one.

42:01.227 --> 42:04.438
And when the verdict comes in,
I'm gonna be looking at you, not her.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.903
[Lorna] I knew something was up.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.781
You were planning this fuckery
the entire time.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.784
-You made me do all this for nothing.
-[Mickey] Not for nothing.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.744
We got what we wanted, discovery.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.496
Sometimes it's not a straight line.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.626
I'll make it up to you.
I'll let you write my witness questions.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.585
-All right?
-Ugh.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.046
After I get sleep.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.715
-I have been awake for, like, 36 hours.
-Done.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.803
Let me shut the copier down,
and we'll get out of here.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.431
I didn't realize you were coming back.
Lorna said you didn't need me,

42:39.515 --> 42:40.975
so I had Ray come get me.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.519
Oh, sorry. This is Ray.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.187
Ray, Mickey.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.564
Nice to meet you, Ray.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.650
You too. Izzy talks about you a lot.

42:50.317 --> 42:52.570
Sounds like you're the only good boss
in town.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.197
We're gonna hit up this new restaurant.
You wanna come?

42:55.281 --> 42:57.575
No, no, I have a lot of work to do.

42:58.158 --> 42:59.535
-You guys enjoy, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.495
All right. One second.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.095
[Ray] You have a second?

43:19.096 --> 43:20.598
Not really, but okay.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.225
[Ray] I know you think I'm a royal fuckup.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.352
I don't even disagree.

43:26.562 --> 43:31.317
But I'm trying really hard,
and I wanna make Izzy happy.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.568
She deserves it.

43:32.651 --> 43:34.987
Well, we have one thing in common.

43:36.488 --> 43:40.826
Ray, I believe in second chances.
I've gotten more than a few of my own.

43:41.493 --> 43:44.163
But if you hurt Izzy,
I'll make sure you don't get a third.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.205
All right?

43:46.498 --> 43:47.416
You ready?

43:47.916 --> 43:48.834
[Ray] Yeah.

43:49.418 --> 43:51.086
Uh, enjoy your dinner.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.214
Izzy, please don't send me
pictures of your food like Lorna does.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.507
You know, just enjoy it.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.967
[Izzy laughs]

43:57.676 --> 43:58.886
You ready? Let's go.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.180
[door opens]

44:02.014 --> 44:03.015
[door closes]

44:07.519 --> 44:09.938
[dog barking in distance]

44:22.159 --> 44:23.494
[Wheaton] Who the hell are you?

44:23.994 --> 44:25.120
I'm a friend

44:26.705 --> 44:28.374
of Lorna Crane's.

44:28.457 --> 44:29.500
[Wheaton] Oh.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.584
Uh…

44:31.418 --> 44:33.045
-Yeah. About that--
-I know.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.589
She already spoke to you in detail.

44:36.507 --> 44:39.551
So I'm just putting a period
on the end of the sentence.

44:41.762 --> 44:42.846
You hearin' me?

44:44.014 --> 44:45.265
Yeah, loud and clear.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.561
You should get a video doorbell.

44:50.062 --> 44:53.148
You never know who's gonna show up
on your front porch.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.324
[door opens]

45:06.120 --> 45:08.997
This is low, even for you.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.667
Using Hayley that way.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.336
Oh. I don't think so, Maggie.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.548
You and your BFF
discussed my case in front of her,

45:17.631 --> 45:19.299
and then she lied to me about it.

45:19.383 --> 45:23.053
If we explain that to ten judges,
maybe ten will consider it a conflict.

45:23.762 --> 45:25.556
We weren't discussing you or your case.

45:25.639 --> 45:28.016
It just came up,
and Hayley happened to overhear.

45:28.100 --> 45:32.104
-What was I supposed to do about that?
-You and your amiguita crossed the line.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.439
You wanna talk about lines?

45:33.522 --> 45:36.400
You're representing the chef
who sent all that food to the table

45:36.483 --> 45:37.568
and kissed your ass.

45:37.651 --> 45:40.529
She wasn't kissing my ass.
She was just being nice.

45:40.612 --> 45:43.949
Oh, is that what it takes to get
the great Mickey Haller to represent you?

45:44.032 --> 45:45.743
A little flattery. A little…

45:50.789 --> 45:52.791
You fucked her, didn't you?

45:54.042 --> 45:57.171
-Mickey, you slept with your client?
-She wasn't my client yet.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.674
You have the audacity
to call my innocent conversation with Andy

46:00.758 --> 46:01.967
a conflict of interest?

46:02.050 --> 46:05.179
Do you have any idea how bad this looks?

46:05.262 --> 46:08.515
It was only one time, and it's over.
Nothing's going on between us.

46:08.599 --> 46:12.019
You found out I was seeing someone else,
so you slept with the first woman

46:12.102 --> 46:14.146
who stroked your ego.

46:14.229 --> 46:17.357
Maggie, we're not together anymore.
You made that clear.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.235
I told you I was fine with it.
But the second I'm with someone else--

46:20.319 --> 46:21.737
This is not the same.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.489
I have to move on with my life.

46:23.572 --> 46:24.865
So do I!

46:27.242 --> 46:28.619
[sighs]

46:35.250 --> 46:38.462
The night I ran into you
at the food truck, I thought to myself,

46:38.545 --> 46:41.799
"Wow, that is the Mickey I love."

46:42.466 --> 46:46.136
Then you go, and you pull
all this underhanded shit.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.971
Just like always.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.348
Come on, Maggie. I--

46:49.431 --> 46:51.600
No, you know what?
You do what you're gonna do.

46:51.683 --> 46:55.854
Just leave our daughter out of it,
and leave me out of it too.

47:10.786 --> 47:11.912
[exhales]

47:15.666 --> 47:17.251
[cell phone chimes]

47:29.930 --> 47:31.932
[suspenseful music playing]

47:41.775 --> 47:43.777
[light snoring]

47:53.954 --> 47:55.914
[Winston snuffles]

47:58.458 --> 47:59.668
[whimpers]

48:01.587 --> 48:03.463
You went to see the dean, didn't you?

48:06.842 --> 48:11.305
I love you, Cisco,
but you have got to let sleeping dogs lie.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.809
And I'm including Winston.
Tomorrow, he's back on the bed.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.856
[Lorna chuckles softly]

48:20.939 --> 48:22.524
[doorbell rings]

48:29.573 --> 48:30.574
-[Mickey] Hey.
-[Lisa] Hey.

48:30.657 --> 48:31.950
-Come in.
-Thanks.

48:33.035 --> 48:34.453
-[Mickey clears throat]
-Wow.

48:36.622 --> 48:40.709
Hey, before you say anything,
I wanna apologize for Henry.

48:41.710 --> 48:44.421
I-I just couldn't spend another night
in jail, Mickey.

48:44.504 --> 48:46.256
Come on, Lisa. I understand.

48:46.340 --> 48:49.468
We have a contract, but maybe
you and Henry can figure something out?

48:49.551 --> 48:52.137
I can handle Henry.
It's you I'm worried about.

48:52.220 --> 48:56.350
Come on. This guy is just trying
to take advantage of you, Lisa.

48:56.433 --> 48:57.893
[scoffs, tuts]

48:58.560 --> 49:01.855
I'm a grown-ass woman, Mickey.
I can take care of myself.

49:03.148 --> 49:05.150
I know an operator when I see one.

49:05.233 --> 49:07.277
Are you trying to say something?

49:07.361 --> 49:08.487
About you?

49:08.570 --> 49:09.905
[tuts] No.

49:12.532 --> 49:14.993
Besides, I do all my best talking
with food.

49:17.245 --> 49:18.246
[Mickey clears throat]

49:19.081 --> 49:20.916
Why don't I warm this up and…

49:21.792 --> 49:23.543
As much as I want to, I…

49:24.670 --> 49:26.171
[sighs] You know, we--

49:26.254 --> 49:28.548
We can't socialize outside of the office.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.429
Hmm, not even to talk about my case?

49:34.930 --> 49:36.556
You know I'm attracted to you.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.142
That's why
as long as I'm representing you, we--

49:40.310 --> 49:42.270
we have to keep it professional.

49:45.273 --> 49:46.233
Understand?

49:47.651 --> 49:48.527
Sure.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.237
[Mickey, quietly] I'm sorry.

49:51.571 --> 49:52.406
Well…

49:54.574 --> 49:59.121
Maybe when this is all over,
we can pick up where we left off.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.539
[Mickey chuckles softly]

50:01.081 --> 50:02.499
I would love that, yeah.

50:07.671 --> 50:09.089
No use in wasting food.

50:10.298 --> 50:11.258
Thank you.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.639
[pensive music playing]

50:17.723 --> 50:21.351
You know, you still haven't said
if you believe I'm innocent.

50:22.227 --> 50:25.772
Lisa, I-- Come on. I told you
it doesn't matter what I believe.

50:25.856 --> 50:29.234
My job is to get you a not-guilty verdict,
no matter what.

50:29.901 --> 50:31.153
[Lisa] It matters to me.

50:32.446 --> 50:35.323
I need you to believe me, Mickey.
And I need you to say it.

50:37.576 --> 50:38.994
Of course I believe you.

50:43.123 --> 50:43.957
Okay.

51:12.027 --> 51:13.570
[exhales slowly]
