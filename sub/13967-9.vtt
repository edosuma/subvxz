"Tyrant."

<i> Previously on</i>
"Tyrant"

00:21.380 --> 00:22.790
Molly.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.690
I'm home.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.720
<i> I didn't fall into your bed</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:28.027
to end your marriage.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.363
Good-bye, dearest.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.532
(Maloof)<i> We've been tracking</i>
<i> Hanif Kattan.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.367
He's been in touch
with his sister,

00:35.369 --> 00:36.570
<i> Mahdiya Kattan.</i>

00:36.570 --> 00:38.800
(Mahdiya)<i> I volunteered to be a martyr.</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:42.041
<i> To bring jihad</i><i> to their backyard.</i>
(bang)

00:42.043 --> 00:44.410
(Barry)<i> We will not wait for them</i>
<i> to attack us again.</i>

00:44.412 --> 00:46.211
Therefore,
as of this moment,

00:46.213 --> 00:47.346
a state of war

00:47.348 --> 00:49.148
<i>exists between Abuddin</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.883
<i> and the so-called Caliphate.</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:52.317
Are you denying my authority?

00:52.319 --> 00:54.520
You're an interim,
unelected President

00:54.522 --> 00:57.390
To declare war on your last
month of presidency, Bassam...

00:57.390 --> 00:58.290
I'll declare war

00:58.290 --> 01:00.759
in the last month,
on the last day!

01:00.761 --> 01:02.327
If I'm elected your president,

01:02.329 --> 01:03.420
I will immediately

01:03.420 --> 01:06.765
<i> withdraw our troops from a war</i>
<i> we should not be fighting.</i>

01:07.260 --> 01:08.180
<i> What happens</i>

01:08.180 --> 01:10.400
in the first six weeks?
Will we have enough success

01:10.400 --> 01:12.271
to make it
politically impossible

01:12.273 --> 01:14.470
for the next president
to withdraw our troops?

01:14.470 --> 01:15.607
Well, you know
I can't answer that.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.875
You want to kill the man

01:16.877 --> 01:18.110
who murdered
your daughter?

01:18.112 --> 01:21.080
You have to do it yourself!

01:21.082 --> 01:24.850
I look forward to elections
in Abuddin.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.087
But now is not the time.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.689
I am postponing,
not cancelling,

01:30.691 --> 01:32.024
our presidential elections

01:32.026 --> 01:33.525
until we can be certain

01:33.527 --> 01:35.660
that the Caliphate
has been destroyed

01:35.660 --> 01:36.628
once and for all.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.632
Bassam once told us

01:40.634 --> 01:43.202
that no single person

01:43.204 --> 01:45.704
should mean more than
all of us together.

01:45.706 --> 01:49.241
He told us
to demand democracy,

01:49.243 --> 01:51.143
demand free elections,

01:51.145 --> 01:54.046
and an end to the dynasties.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.510
Now, for the second time
in less than a year,

01:57.510 --> 02:00.919
that is exactly
what we have to do.

02:00.921 --> 02:04.656
Our President has
turned his back on us,

02:04.658 --> 02:06.792
on his own revolution,

02:06.794 --> 02:08.994
on those who died

02:08.996 --> 02:11.497
for a free and democratic
Abuddin.

02:11.499 --> 02:15.667
But we, all of us,

02:15.669 --> 02:17.803
are more than that man,

02:17.805 --> 02:21.440
who was once our hero,
once my friend.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.840
The Al Fayeed dynasty
must end!

02:24.840 --> 02:27.412
(crowd cheers)

02:27.414 --> 02:29.615
It must end!

02:29.617 --> 02:32.151
The Al Fayeed dynasty must e...

02:32.153 --> 02:33.720
(Maloof) It's treason.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.320
He wants to stir them
into a mob.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.250
And look at them,
ready to turn on you.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.991
They don't understand
how far you've brought them.

02:38.993 --> 02:42.261
Months ago, right before
you took office...

02:42.263 --> 02:43.860
remember?
You said the people here,

02:43.860 --> 02:45.490
they have no experience
with democracy.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.232
You said they couldn't
learn overnight.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.502
Well, okay,
the night's been long,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.270
and this is the darkest part,

02:52.270 --> 02:53.970
but what do they think's
going to happen when you're gone

02:53.970 --> 02:55.440
and the Caliphate
is at their door,

02:55.442 --> 02:58.210
and that man is the only one
they have to lead them?

03:01.147 --> 03:03.482
He's my oldest friend.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.517
We used to

03:05.519 --> 03:08.387
commiserate about my father when
we were kids, getting drunk.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.756
The old dictator.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.928
Now he says the same
things about me.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.933
I don't want a hair
touched on his head.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.874
But this can't be
allowed to continue.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.742
Arrest him.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.818
I understand you're in
a very difficult position.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.487
I'm sorry, you invited me here
so you could help me?

03:42.489 --> 03:45.350
You very publicly support a
so-called democratic regime,

03:45.350 --> 03:48.060
to have it only transform to
something quite different.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.895
And it's not
the first time.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.998
We do have a history of being
disappointed by our partners,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.167
but what's to say you won't
disappoint us, too?

03:55.169 --> 03:57.035
I'm not asking you
to support me.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.204
I'm asking you to
support free elections.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.440
By abandoning
Bassam Al Fayeed?

04:01.440 --> 04:04.042
By abandoning your
support of his war.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.870
Without which
he cannot make war.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.980
And without that war,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.847
Bassam has no reason
to deny the vote.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.048
You and I both know

04:10.050 --> 04:11.610
Bassam doesn't want
to be President.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.285
He never wanted it.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.187
What he wants is revenge.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.023
I think that's right.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.629
And tragic heroes make
very poor political partners.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.736
(soft chuckle)

04:30.738 --> 04:32.471
(door closes)
Halima.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.809
It's nice
to see you.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.244
Thank you for making time.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.312
Should we sit?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.223
(clears throat)

04:52.290 --> 04:54.294
(clicks lips)

04:54.294 --> 04:56.395
I know you've come here

04:56.397 --> 04:59.231
to ask me to rethink
the elections.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.899
But you need
to understand

05:00.901 --> 05:02.830
what a dangerous
situation this is...

05:02.830 --> 05:05.304
I didn't come
to argue with you.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.172
I'm not important enough
for that.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.510
Look, Halima, I...

05:15.748 --> 05:17.683
(sighs)

05:22.455 --> 05:23.855
(exhales)

05:30.963 --> 05:33.031
I've seen the person
you used to be.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.367
I fought next to him.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.804
And even though
we're sitting in this office

05:38.806 --> 05:41.807
instead of some
bombed-out building,

05:41.809 --> 05:43.542
I remember you.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.614
Even if you don't,
I remember you.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.257
Thank you for coming.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.242
(door opens)

06:20.179 --> 06:22.013
(phone rings)

06:22.015 --> 06:23.014
Daliyah?

06:23.016 --> 06:25.150
Fauzi.
Where are you?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.185
Headed to my car on the way
back to headquarters.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.187
Tell your driver to bring you
to my house.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.889
What? Why?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.858
I'll tell you
when you get here.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.360
Is everything okay?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.861
Please, just trust me.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.496
- And, Fauzi...
- Yes?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.332
Come straight here.
Don't go home.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.901
Are you sure?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.236
I trust him.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.230
We're on the
Commission together.

06:46.230 --> 06:47.570
His cousin's
in the army.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.441
He said Bassam issued the order
this morning.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.909
The charge is treason.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.514
Fauzi, you need
to get out of Abuddin.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.915
I've got a way

06:56.917 --> 06:58.780
across the border.
We'll get you to Jordan...

06:58.780 --> 07:00.218
No, I can't leave.
I can't leave.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.187
Not in the middle of this.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.550
I ran away once before.

07:03.550 --> 07:05.257
I'm not gonna
abandon this country again.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.593
I'm not going to argue with you
about your guilt.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.228
But this is different.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.730
You can't speak for anyone
if you're dead

07:12.730 --> 07:13.899
or in chains.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.368
Any opposition government
will have to form abroad.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.171
Be the people's voice
from there.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.106
Then come with me.

07:21.108 --> 07:21.973
What?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.770
You're no safer here
than I am.

07:23.770 --> 07:24.543
Fauzi...

07:24.545 --> 07:26.945
Daliyah,
I can't leave you here

07:26.947 --> 07:29.381
to take all the risks
while I run from them.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.450
Come with me.
We'll both stand up to him,

07:31.450 --> 07:32.951
as equal partners.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.720
If I know we're in this fight
together, then I can go.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.625
(indistinct crowd chatter)

07:43.620 --> 07:46.098

(faucet closes)

09:07.513 --> 09:09.881
Are you okay?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.149
I got a call.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.918
The court

09:12.920 --> 09:14.786
handed down its sentence.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.722
Is he going to be executed?

09:18.691 --> 09:20.258
In three days.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.627
They'll let me see him
once before.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.230
You should go.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.698
Say your good-byes.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.401
Say good-bye
for me, too.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.769
You hate him.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.203
I don't hate Wafiq.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.039
Then you hate me
for loving him.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.940
No, I don't. I...

09:37.510 --> 09:38.710
(softly) I miss you.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.212
As for your brother...

09:41.214 --> 09:42.614
God is the one
who forgives.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.950
I don't have
that much mercy in me.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.287
After all he's done,
I'm not sure how you do.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.523
Really?

09:51.525 --> 09:54.125
You don't understand
unconditional love?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.194
I have no one else,
but him.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.230
- Nafisa.
- Since I was

09:58.230 --> 09:59.364
five years old.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.866
Since their gas attacks
made us orphans.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.301
He took care of me!

10:03.303 --> 10:04.636
He raised me!

10:04.638 --> 10:06.438
I love him.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.710
No matter what he does.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.540
And I hate them!

10:14.547 --> 10:17.749
No matter
what they do.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.552
He never went home last night.
Someone tipped him off.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.753
Who?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.822
I don't know.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.125
I have a thought.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.790
Your husband, maybe.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.430
No. That's...
I... I don't believe that.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.497
You heard what he said
yesterday.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.898
I did.
I may be wrong.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.333
But it makes sense.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.103
A kind of amnesty.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.573
Leave the country and I'll
let you be, old friend.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.742
I don't know if

10:43.744 --> 10:47.479
the President has the stamina
to do what's necessary.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.080
Those who oppose him
are the same people

10:49.082 --> 10:51.082
who made him
who he is.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.352
His conviction may waver
in the face of that.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.288
I have influence.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.858
You have more.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.828
If it becomes a problem,
I'll make sure.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.498
That's good.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.869
But be careful, General.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.039
Remember you work for us
and not the other way around.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.208
(Barry) Maloof.
(footsteps approach)

11:17.210 --> 11:18.990
Ah, there you are.

11:18.990 --> 11:21.446
I've been looking at the maps
of Caliphate territory...

11:24.650 --> 11:25.850
What?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.919
Fauzi Nidal is missing.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.910
(utensils clinking)

11:41.534 --> 11:42.667
Nice uniform.

11:42.669 --> 11:43.702
Shit.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.170
I didn't see you there.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.671
Are you hungry?
They made too much.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.773
No, thanks.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.242
I thought you weren't hungry.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.245
Did you ever imagine
when you were, I don't know,

11:54.247 --> 11:56.980
getting stoned every morning,
that you'd end up a soldier

11:56.980 --> 11:58.049
in my dad's army?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.718
I'm sorry.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.885
Our dad's army.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.654
What do you want me
to say?

12:02.656 --> 12:03.922
Has anyone told my mom?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.520
Given what
she's gone through,

12:05.520 --> 12:06.658
it seems a little soon.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.894
She deserves to know.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.529
She does.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.431
And I have no reason
to hide it.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.033
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.502
Not by being born, no...

12:18.938 --> 12:21.239
I know you're angry
with your mother.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.440
What if she's right?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.109
Have you considered that?

12:24.111 --> 12:27.412
And my dad is wrong?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.447
I mean, our dad.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.382
I know my mother.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.550
And if she ever
got the presidency,

12:32.552 --> 12:34.252
she would never
give it up.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.854
They're all the same.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.689
I'm telling you.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.090
So pick a side.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.929
Okay, so general relativity.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.590
Go. Just the basics.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.032
The exam is tomorrow.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.435
You want me start explaining
relativity to you now?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.230
You have to accept
8:00 a.m. classes

12:52.230 --> 12:53.770
are just not a viable
option for you.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.974
How many people can you have
at an organizing meeting

12:55.976 --> 12:57.108
in two hours?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.309
Organizing for what?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.711
A University-wide sit-in

12:59.713 --> 13:01.040
protesting
Bassam Al Fayeed's decision

13:01.040 --> 13:02.080
to call off the elections.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.782
You want my help?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.284
I don't want your help.
I need your help.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.120
(chuckling) Isn't that ironic?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.721
Look, we're taking on
the government

13:09.723 --> 13:10.755
and the army here.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.290
Even united
we're up against it,

13:12.290 --> 13:13.825
but divided... forget it.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.260
So...

13:15.262 --> 13:18.062
you're finally ready
to admit I was right

13:18.064 --> 13:19.497
about Bassam Al Fayeed.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.236
Yes, you were right.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.072
Say it again.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.209
You were right.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.248
Now help me stop him.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.317
(indistinct conversation)

13:41.010 --> 13:44.010
(brakes squealing)

13:51.997 --> 13:53.965
Thank you for seeing us.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.767
(Siddiq) This is government
property.

13:55.769 --> 13:56.990
You're not safe here.

13:56.990 --> 13:59.370
If General Maloof found out...

13:59.372 --> 14:01.806
I suppose that shows how
much I trust you, Governor,

14:01.808 --> 14:04.309
and how important this
meeting is for both of us.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.870
We have a common problem.

14:05.870 --> 14:07.212
I'm not sure we want
the same thing.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.113
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.315
Bassam is not my enemy.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.940
I can't think of him like that.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.117
He's just lost his way.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.886
And we have to help
him find his way back.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.720
And if you did, and if
the election were held tomorrow,

14:17.720 --> 14:19.691
I would vote for Fauzi Nidal,
not for you.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.520
I want you
to have that chance.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.590
I am not making civil war

14:23.590 --> 14:24.490
against Bassam Al Fayeed.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.760
Who said anything about war?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.190
I'm talking about pressure,
political pressure.

14:28.190 --> 14:29.834
There's no such thing.
He's beyond reasoning now.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.803
That's why I'm talking
to the Americans.

14:31.805 --> 14:33.671
The Americans?

14:33.673 --> 14:36.074
You really think they would
abandon their own chosen man?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.876
Our meeting suggested
they might.

14:38.844 --> 14:39.911
Well, when you

14:39.913 --> 14:41.212
hear back from them...

14:41.214 --> 14:43.090
You are the governor
of Ma'an Province

14:43.090 --> 14:44.382
appointed by
the President.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.984
To do nothing is
to give approval

14:45.986 --> 14:47.719
to Bassam's dictatorship.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.488
There is no such thing
as remaining neutral.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.590
You have to pick a side.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.926
What exactly did

14:54.928 --> 14:57.462
your family die for, Governor?

14:59.700 --> 15:02.500
(cork squeaks)

15:02.501 --> 15:03.668
(Cogswell) So, what's the word?

15:03.670 --> 15:04.903
Nothing.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.237
No decision yet
by the State Department,

15:06.239 --> 15:08.339
maybe in a day or two.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.275
Well, what was your
recommendation?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.511
Exley?

15:15.414 --> 15:18.416
That we maintain our support
for the current President.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.220
Why? (thuds glass)
Why the hell would you settle for that?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.587
Because whether you
like him or not,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.789
Bassam has learned
to wield power.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.557
And power,
even without principle,

15:26.559 --> 15:28.450
- is better than chaos.
- All right.

15:28.450 --> 15:30.528
Let me go to Washington
and make my case.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.297
Your judgment is clouded.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.700
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.536
Let's just leave
some things unsaid.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.110
What is it that they say
about second marriages?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.879
The triumph of optimism
over experience?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.649
It's the same
with new presidents.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.718
(door opens and closes)

16:02.640 --> 16:04.640
(pulls up handbrake)

16:12.171 --> 16:13.738
Why don't you go
help your uncle

16:13.740 --> 16:14.806
put the bag in the van?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.940
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.810
Munib makes deliveries

16:22.810 --> 16:24.248
across the border
every week.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.284
The men at the checkpoint
don't bother

16:26.286 --> 16:27.610
to look in the back
anymore.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.780
Just make sure that
Ghani stays quiet.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.890
- What are you talking about?
- Sometimes...

16:30.890 --> 16:31.756
he thinks it's funny

16:31.758 --> 16:33.320
when you shush him
and he'll laugh.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.993
- I guess it's more of a cackle.
- Daliyah.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.861
I need you to take
care of Ghani.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.830
Please.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.201
You're not coming with us.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.006
No.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.942
You were never coming
with us.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.511
I'm sorry.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.313
I had to get you
in this truck.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.448
I thought if I brought you
this far, you couldn't...

16:57.450 --> 16:59.450
I need to keep you safe.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.750
But what about you?

17:00.750 --> 17:01.652
You're not safe, either.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.721
You can't stay...

17:03.723 --> 17:05.890
but someone has to,
otherwise it looks like

17:05.892 --> 17:07.625
we've given up.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.160
I can take the risk.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.361
He won't hurt me.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.530
I'm his best friend

17:12.531 --> 17:14.132
and he's having me arrested.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.530
What makes you think...

17:15.530 --> 17:17.234
He's in love with me.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.539
He's in love with you.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.982
I... I didn't know.

17:30.984 --> 17:33.051
Or maybe I did.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.622
Are you in love with him?

17:40.492 --> 17:42.727
I don't know.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.100
I was...

17:49.102 --> 17:52.003
but I don't know now.

18:03.348 --> 18:06.017
I know how
I feel about you.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.187
Fauzi...

18:09.189 --> 18:10.555
You once said to me,

18:10.557 --> 18:12.356
"The world is so fragile

18:12.358 --> 18:14.826
we can't afford to wait
for what we want."

18:16.395 --> 18:18.696
You are what I want.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.042
This was Samira's.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.777
It hasn't worked
in awhile, I...

18:34.446 --> 18:37.148
I gave it to her when
she graduated high school.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.383
It found itself
into my pocket one day,

18:39.385 --> 18:41.152
and, I don't know,
I just...

18:41.154 --> 18:43.554
I just kept it there.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.690
Keep it for me.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.166
I'll take Ghani and I'll go.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.071
We'll call you
when we get there...

19:00.073 --> 19:02.006
but you have
to promise me.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.642
Any sign of danger
and you get out.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.246
And then,

19:08.248 --> 19:10.448
when things are better...

19:10.450 --> 19:13.084
we'll find each other again.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.187
I promise.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.799
You remember
what I said?

19:32.371 --> 19:35.139
Come on...
I know you do.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.807
You'll be there soon.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.676
As soon as I can.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.279
That's right.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.214
How soon is soon?

19:45.484 --> 19:47.718
I'm not sure.

19:55.227 --> 19:58.196
I don't want you to worry.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.031
Fauzi is a very good friend

20:00.033 --> 20:02.233
and he's going to take
such great care of you,

20:02.235 --> 20:03.935
just like I would.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.178
You need me to be brave.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.279
(sniffles)

20:17.482 --> 20:19.984
I really do.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.100
(sniffles)

20:36.102 --> 20:39.403
I love you...

20:39.405 --> 20:42.473
my wonderful boy.

20:49.470 --> 20:53.470
(sighing)

21:00.926 --> 21:04.095
(door closes, engine starts)

21:04.896 --> 21:06.964
(sobs)

21:28.120 --> 21:30.121
You think I like this?
I hate him.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.750
It makes me sick to think

21:31.750 --> 21:33.090
about being in the
same room with him.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.759
But we're never going
to get anywhere

21:34.761 --> 21:36.590
if we don't start finding
common ground with people.

21:36.590 --> 21:37.740
It's got to start somewhere.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.820
Not like this, Halima.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.290
That guy is scary
and dangerous.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.330
His sister blew herself up
in a hotel.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.230
It was his sister.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.500
I need allies, and he and I
want the same thing.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.430
No, you don't.
You <i> hate</i> the same thing.

21:47.430 --> 21:48.306
That's different.

21:50.108 --> 21:51.909
Okay, you're making me nervous.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.245
Good.

21:54.247 --> 21:56.947
You should
watch your back.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.351
'Cause in the end,
we are who we are,

22:00.353 --> 22:03.020
not what we claim
to believe in.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.656
You want proof?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.025
Look at Bassam Al Fayeed.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.261
He's in Jordan.

22:10.263 --> 22:12.330
How do you know?

22:12.332 --> 22:14.498
He started Tweeting
antigovernment tweets.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.330
Once we saw that,
I contacted our friends

22:17.330 --> 22:18.302
inside the country.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.770
He's in the capital.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.172
He has a child with him.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.107
We believe it's Ghani Al-Yazbek.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.142
Daliyah?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.877
Is she the one
who tipped him off?

22:26.879 --> 22:28.145
How could she have known?

22:28.147 --> 22:30.247
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.950
(Daliyah)<i> I've listened to you.</i>

22:32.952 --> 22:36.487
I've heard you repent
for your sins.

22:36.489 --> 22:41.158
I've seen your pain
and heartache

22:41.160 --> 22:45.596
when you talk
about loved ones lost.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.300
And I've wept with you

22:49.302 --> 22:52.503
over your suffering.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.505
Our suffering.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.841
I wish I could tell you

22:56.843 --> 22:59.377
that our suffering is over.

23:00.345 --> 23:02.480
I don't think it is.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.548
Frederick Douglass,

23:04.550 --> 23:08.819
the former American slave
and abolitionist, said,

23:08.821 --> 23:10.820
"If there is no struggle

23:10.820 --> 23:12.189
there is no progress.

23:12.191 --> 23:16.026
Those who profess
to favor freedom

23:16.028 --> 23:19.263
and yet depreciate agitation,

23:19.265 --> 23:23.267
are men who want crops
without plowing up the ground.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.171
They want rain without

23:27.173 --> 23:29.106
the thunder and lightning.

23:29.108 --> 23:34.178
They want the ocean without the
awful roar of its many waters.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.782
This struggle may be
a moral one,

23:37.784 --> 23:39.917
or it may be a physical one,

23:39.919 --> 23:44.121
and it may be both
moral and physical,

23:44.123 --> 23:46.724
but it must be a struggle.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.594
The limits of tyrants
are prescribed

23:50.596 --> 23:54.098
by the endurance
of those whom they oppress."

23:54.100 --> 23:57.268
Let us show those
who oppress us

23:57.270 --> 24:00.638
that there is no limit
to our endurance.

24:01.807 --> 24:07.311
They cannot break us.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.948
They cannot break us!

24:10.948 --> 24:12.940
(vehicle approaching)

24:36.408 --> 24:39.410
I apologize
for the circumstances.

24:39.412 --> 24:42.112
There are concerns
for my security.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.582
I understand.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.518
I heard your speech.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.421
It was very impressive.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.490
You could be the next president
if you wanted.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.526
If there were elections.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.661
Is that why we're here?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.763
You're nervous
about me?

25:00.765 --> 25:02.266
Don't worry.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.534
I don't want to be President.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.330
I don't want anything at all.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.830
That's why the people trust me.

25:06.830 --> 25:09.300
No, we're here because
you're the purest voice

25:09.300 --> 25:10.875
we have for
a better Abuddin.

25:12.477 --> 25:15.279
And you need to be careful.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.114
I am being careful.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.351
Yet you think you're safe
to say whatever you want,

25:20.353 --> 25:21.880
wherever you want.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.355
Someone has to speak
for the people.

25:29.661 --> 25:32.029
I loved him once, too.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.500
I was the daughter
of a kitchen maid,

25:36.502 --> 25:38.369
as you once reminded me.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.073
And there was this boy.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.777
He loved me.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.649
And he didn't care
who I was,

25:51.651 --> 25:54.151
and where I came from.

25:55.854 --> 25:57.688
And I thought,

25:57.690 --> 26:00.057
"This is what love is."

26:04.429 --> 26:06.830
Bassam and I may not be

26:06.832 --> 26:09.233
on the same side anymore,

26:09.235 --> 26:13.170
but we hold
each other's hearts.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.642
He won't hurt me.

26:25.216 --> 26:27.851
As of this moment,
I am resigning

26:27.853 --> 26:29.680
as Governor
of Ma'an Province

26:29.680 --> 26:32.222
and as superintendent
of this camp.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.192
I am turning control of this
camp over to Major Haleed.

26:35.194 --> 26:38.529
My instructions are to
keep this camp open.

26:38.531 --> 26:41.098
You residents
are free to stay

26:41.100 --> 26:42.433
if you have
nowhere else to go

26:42.435 --> 26:44.735
and basic services
will be available.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.740
But those of you
who want to be reunited

26:47.740 --> 26:50.975
with your families in Ma'an,
you can go.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.077
This is your country, too.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.145
(crowd murmuring)

27:08.140 --> 27:11.140
(overlapping chats)

27:24.275 --> 27:25.809
I believe this is yours.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.813
Thank you.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.780
I was wrong
about a lot of things.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.510
Listen, I'm going back.

27:33.510 --> 27:35.820
I'm joining Leila Haddad
and your brother.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.850
You and your family are welcome
to join me on my journey.

27:37.850 --> 27:38.650
When?

27:38.650 --> 27:39.990
Now. Get your things.
Let's go.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.862
(Wafiq) Don't cry.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.764
I'm not.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.700
I'm dying
for what I believe.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.703
That's about the best
you can hope for these days.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.705
Maybe.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.708
But I'll still miss you.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.310
I know.
I'm sorry.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.770
I stayed for you
as long as I could.

28:01.770 --> 28:03.780
You have to be strong.

28:03.780 --> 28:07.017
You have to pick up
where I'm leaving off.

28:08.319 --> 28:09.887
What does that mean?

28:09.889 --> 28:13.524
You need to kill your husband.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.658
What?

28:14.660 --> 28:15.990
Without him,

28:15.990 --> 28:18.962
that coalition collapses,
and with it,

28:18.964 --> 28:22.100
the last pathetic voices
for a corrupted Islam,

28:22.100 --> 28:23.860
made acceptable
to the West.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.036
You can't ask me to do that.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.340
Either I die for a reason
or I die in vain.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.575
It's your choice.

28:31.577 --> 28:34.044
That's not fair.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.679
Nothing is fair.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.748
I took care of you.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.050
And now,
I'm asking that you

28:40.052 --> 28:43.387
take care of me.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.190
There is a pharmacist
in Ma'an

28:46.192 --> 28:48.292
who is friendly
to our cause.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.729
He'll help you.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.064
Promise me.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.599
(door bangs open)

28:56.735 --> 28:59.937
You must leave, now.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.370
- Just one more minute.
- Come on, let's go.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.007
One more, please?

29:04.009 --> 29:06.040
- I took care of you.
- Let's go.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.011
Nafisa!

29:10.615 --> 29:12.015
Nafisa!

29:12.017 --> 29:14.451
I... I love you, brother.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.450
(sobbing)

29:20.458 --> 29:23.293
Is it because I'm a woman?

29:23.295 --> 29:26.196
I don't know.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.865
No, I don't...

29:27.867 --> 29:30.567
I don't think so.

29:30.569 --> 29:34.271
Democracy isn't
our highest priority right now.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.906
You agree with the decision?

29:35.908 --> 29:37.307
It doesn't matter
what I think.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.070
But no, of course
I don't agree with it.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.177
You know that.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.485
Then he has his war.

29:48.485 --> 29:50.480
(sighs)

29:51.556 --> 29:53.720
I don't know
if I have any play left

29:53.720 --> 29:55.360
with the United States
on his side.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.990
Short of a
civil war?

29:58.463 --> 30:00.898
I don't think you have any.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.569
You have to be careful.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.800
Thanks for the advice.

30:10.241 --> 30:13.844
I need you
to be careful.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.846
Before I end up in prison

30:15.848 --> 30:19.449
- you mean?
- Or dead.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.885
That's what happens.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.890
I know, I have been
to those executions.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.025
I couldn't handle that.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.407
I love you, too.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.910
The Americans have chosen
to abandon their principle

30:52.910 --> 30:54.284
rather than the man.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.454
We won't get
any support from them.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.690
There is a warrant out
for Fauzi's arrest.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.120
Word is he left the country.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.126
I may be next.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.895
No one's safe here.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.864
Any of us.

31:12.237 --> 31:15.200
Okay, men... (claps hands)
no rest tonight.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.707
I want you to surround
this house.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.141
Be alert, be vigilant.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.177
This house and
the safety of the

31:20.179 --> 31:23.213
people inside
is our new mission.

31:24.749 --> 31:28.418
You have protectors now.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.861
Can I help you?

31:37.863 --> 31:41.031
We're here to take
you to the Palace.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.201
I didn't know I'd been
invited to the Palace.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.069
The First Lady invited you.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.970
Please tell her thank you,

31:48.970 --> 31:50.874
but I'm a little busy
right now.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.843
It won't take long.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.115
(indistinct chatter)

32:01.220 --> 32:04.220
(envelope rustling)

32:04.222 --> 32:06.089
Thank you.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.524
(paper rustling)

32:34.919 --> 32:37.354
Mm...

32:46.731 --> 32:50.334
Mmm, it smells nice.

33:13.925 --> 33:14.925
Ow!

33:14.927 --> 33:16.593
It's so hot.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.396
I never knew how you
drink things so hot.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.766
(blows)

33:24.135 --> 33:26.603
(blows)

33:30.041 --> 33:31.274
Wait.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.610
What?

33:35.046 --> 33:36.313
Tastes bad.

33:36.315 --> 33:39.616
Smells good, but
it tastes bad.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.120
(glass clinking)
It has an aftertaste.

33:42.120 --> 33:42.953
I'll make another.

33:42.955 --> 33:44.550
Don't be silly.
I'm sure it tastes fine.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.020
It's not fine.
I know. Give it to me.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.625
Why waste a good pot of tea?

33:48.627 --> 33:49.993
A mistake is not a waste.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.828
It's just that: a mistake.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.660
I'm sure mine tastes fine.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.065
It's not.
Trust me.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.605
Okay.

34:03.741 --> 34:06.243
You taste it.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.310
What?

34:07.312 --> 34:08.980
You sit down

34:08.980 --> 34:10.414
and taste it for me.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.510
No, it's okay.
I'll make another.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.751
No.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.168
Drink it.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.007
Drink it, Nafisa.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.556
(glass shatters)

34:53.559 --> 34:54.858
(breathes shakily)

35:08.906 --> 35:10.407
(door closes)

35:10.409 --> 35:13.009
You've changed since
the last time I saw you.

35:14.645 --> 35:16.980
So have you.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.851
Tea?

35:22.153 --> 35:24.187
No, thank you.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.656
You have such

35:26.658 --> 35:29.192
remarkable PR,
don't you?

35:30.561 --> 35:33.296
Poor Bedouin woman
from a tiny village.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.331
Dead husband.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.499
No education.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.135
Guileless and simple.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.570
I'm not having this conversation
with you.

35:41.572 --> 35:42.739
What happened with you

35:42.741 --> 35:44.341
and my husband
during the war?

35:45.309 --> 35:46.743
Did you touch his hand

35:46.745 --> 35:49.179
once or twice?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.447
Did you call him a hero?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.849
Maybe...

35:52.851 --> 35:54.550
give him an
innocent kiss?

35:54.550 --> 35:56.153
Nothing untoward,

35:56.155 --> 35:58.522
and then you said good-bye.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.193
But not really.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.229
You moved.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.100
Just close enough...

36:10.102 --> 36:14.804
so when he returned
to his older wife,

36:14.806 --> 36:17.841
with whom he'd built a life
and raised two children

36:17.843 --> 36:20.677
over 20 years...

36:20.679 --> 36:22.746
but had no adventures...

36:24.549 --> 36:27.017
there you still were.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.820
That's not why
I came here.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.557
Is that what
you tell yourself?

36:35.526 --> 36:39.963
As soon as I was gone,
the day I was gone, maybe?

36:41.799 --> 36:44.301
You took my place
in his bed.

36:45.503 --> 36:48.138
He thought
you weren't coming back.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.573
Oh! Well, you and he

36:49.575 --> 36:51.741
certainly gave that
hypothesis long enough.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.247
And now this job.

36:57.249 --> 37:00.250
This apolitical job,
which you somehow

37:00.252 --> 37:04.554
managed to turn into the
loudest soapbox in the country.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.157
Turned yourself
into a celebrity.

37:07.159 --> 37:09.960
All by accident, was it?

37:10.928 --> 37:14.965
No... not by accident...

37:16.434 --> 37:18.768
but not by design.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.370
I wonder how things
would have been different

37:23.370 --> 37:24.908
if you weren't so beautiful.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.414
You get everything you want,
don't you?

37:32.383 --> 37:35.285
No, I don't.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.220
(door opens)
Molly...

37:38.220 --> 37:39.356
when we
meet with the...

37:41.959 --> 37:43.426
Daliyah, what are
you doing here?

37:43.428 --> 37:45.829
Your wife summoned me.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.532
Why?

37:49.534 --> 37:52.502
To make this easier for you.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.805
To make what easier for you?

37:58.242 --> 37:59.670
What are you waiting for?

37:59.670 --> 38:01.945
Are you gonna choose your whore
or your own daughter?

38:11.589 --> 38:13.290
You're under arrest.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.428
What?

38:18.430 --> 38:20.664
Guards.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.699
(door opens)

38:25.603 --> 38:27.170
(Barry) Take this woman
into custody.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.538
(guard) Yes, sir.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.825
You couldn't do it,
that's what matters.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.529
No.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.564
You and I...

38:56.334 --> 38:59.936
we're more the same
than different, Nafisa.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.638
That's why I fell in love
with you.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.308
That's why I
stayed with you.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.976
When I see you
with our children,

39:06.978 --> 39:08.311
- all loving and...
- (Nafisa gasping)

39:08.313 --> 39:10.680
I'm not a loving person.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.315
I'm not.

39:12.317 --> 39:13.850
I'm angry all the time.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.920
And I just don't understand.

39:18.222 --> 39:21.458
Your mother died
in the gas attacks.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.127

39:24.129 --> 39:27.530
Why don't you hate people

39:27.532 --> 39:30.967
I don't know.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.870
For all the terrible things
that happen,

39:33.872 --> 39:36.139
life still makes me happy.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.208
(sobbing)

39:44.915 --> 39:47.150
I should have taken better care
of you.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.492
This just happened?

39:55.494 --> 39:56.990
Yes. He resigned
as Governor

39:56.990 --> 39:58.490
and joined Leila
and Al-Qadi.

39:58.490 --> 40:00.263
- How many troops does he have?
- We're not sure.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.900
There have been desertions
from the army already.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.200
Native Ma'anians mostly.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.600
And there will be more.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.970
What about Cogswell
and the Americans?

40:05.970 --> 40:07.370
They're staying put, for now.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.938
With your approval,
we'll move in the morning.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.274
Put down the insurgency
before it has a chance to grow.

40:11.276 --> 40:12.575
Ahmed, I want you to go, too.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.610

see you there.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.911

40:14.913 --> 40:18.581
Get this under control
immediately.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.363
What are you
praying for?

40:34.298 --> 40:35.799
Strength.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.301
You should pray for something
you don't have.

40:40.638 --> 40:42.439
I'm praying for you.

40:44.909 --> 40:49.546
I have done everything
that I promised I would do.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.782
I have broken with everyone
I love for Emma and for you.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.219
Not because you asked me to,
because I decided to.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.520
So I don't need your prayers.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.850
I'm not asking for forgiveness,

40:59.850 --> 41:03.893
but don't ever talk to me
that way.

41:03.895 --> 41:07.163
I am the President,
not you.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.134
I just got off the phone
with the Palace.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.970
The Abuddinian Army
is preparing to move

41:12.970 --> 41:14.637
on Siddiq's militia
first thing tomorrow.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.573
- How many men we got in there?
- About a thousand.

41:16.575 --> 41:17.907
We need to get them out.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.143
What about Siddiq's men...
Leila?

41:20.145 --> 41:21.411

by soldiers we trained,

41:26.918 --> 41:28.650

immeasurable.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.487

about, though, is there?

42:37.422 --> 42:40.557
You've already made
all your decisions.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.626

Small arms.
Some guy in Ma'an.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.260
