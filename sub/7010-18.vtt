WE COULD GO SHOPPING,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.465

WE NEED TO GET YOU

02:47.792 --> 02:49.459
WHATEVER.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.628
THE POINT IS THAT
WHEN A BOY HITS THAT AGE,

02:51.796 --> 02:54.047
THEY DON'T WANNA SPEND
TIME WITH THEIR MOTHER.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.632

WHAT HE WANTS.

PAYING HIS WAY...

03:23.369 --> 03:26.038
WE OWN HIM.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.875

I'D SEE THE DAY.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.069
SO WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

05:21.237 --> 05:24.031
IT'S JUST SO TWILIGHT ZONE,
I MEAN, TO SEE FEZ...

05:24.198 --> 05:31.163
ERIC! YOUR MOTHER ASKED YOU A
QUESTION ABOUT THE FOREIGN KID.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.878
WHAT? OH.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.713
WHAT?
NO. NEVER MIND.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.048

IS THIS...

06:00.276 --> 06:02.611
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA
GO SHOPPING WITH MOM?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.864
YOU DON'T WANNA GO
SHOPPING WITH YOUR MOM?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.326
BOY, I TELL YA,
IF I HAD A MOM,

06:09.494 --> 06:11.870
I WOULD GO SHOPPING
WITH HER EVERY SINGLE DAY,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.622
BECAUSE NO ONE LOVES YOU...

06:13.790 --> 06:16.583

06:17.251 --> 06:19.461
THAT'S TRUE.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.840
ERIC, HONEY, WE DON'T
HAVE TO GO SHOPPING.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.175
WE COULD GO
SEE A MOVIE.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.677
IT'LL BE LIKE
A LITTLE DATE.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.262
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHOPPING'S GREAT.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.890
YOU KNOW, I, UM, I NEED
NEW UNDERWEAR, SO...

08:04.901 --> 08:06.276
GO TO THE MALL TOGETHER
SO I CAN INTRODUCE YOU...

08:06.444 --> 08:07.819

THEIR MOTHERS

11:15.299 --> 11:16.966

HUGE PROBLEMS.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.594
YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.262
AND EVERY RELATIONSHIP
YOU HAVE WITH A WOMAN

11:21.430 --> 11:22.972
WILL JUST BE A MESS.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.100
SO, IF YOU DON'T
SPEND TIME WITH ME NOW,

11:33.192 --> 11:35.276
I'M TEASING!

11:35.444 --> 11:39.072

11:39.490 --> 11:41.700
AHA. HEY...

11:41.867 --> 11:45.370
LOOK HOW FAR FLORENCE
IS FROM... VENICE.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.580
ERIC...

11:47.748 --> 11:49.332
HONEY, I JUST...

11:49.500 --> 11:51.751
I JUST WANTED TO SPEND A
LITTLE TIME ALONE WITH YOU

11:51.919 --> 11:55.380
OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE.
THAT'S ALL.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.590
MOM, IT'S FINE.

11:57.758 --> 12:01.428
AND, IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GREAT.

12:03.889 --> 12:08.268
HEY, FORMAN'S OUT ON
A DATE WITH HIS MOM!

12:08.436 --> 12:14.023
FORMAN AND HIS MOM!

12:18.112 --> 12:20.488
[THINKING] MY GOODNESS,
THAT WOODY ALLEN IS NEUROTIC.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.574
WELL, IF I LIVED IN NEW YORK,
I'D BE IN THERAPY, TOO.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.660
THE STREETS ARE FILTHY.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.872
[THINKING]
WHOA! DIANE KEATON
IS NOT WEARING A BRA.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.708
OKAY, DON'T LET YOUR MOM
SEE YOU LOOK.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.334
BUT I HAVE TO LOOK.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.961
I'M LOOKIN'.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.964
I'M LOOKIN',
AND I DON'T CARE!

12:38.132 --> 12:39.799
OH, PLEASE.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.176
HE EXPECTS HER
TO MAKE LOVE

12:41.343 --> 12:44.471
WHILE HE'S WEARING
THOSE BLACK SOCKS?

12:44.638 --> 12:48.767
NOTE TO SELF: THROW
AWAY ALL BLACK SOCKS.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.311
MAH-JONGG?

12:51.479 --> 12:54.230
WHAT THE HELL

12:54.398 --> 12:55.482
MAH-JONGG?

12:55.649 --> 12:58.777
WHAT THE HELL
IS MAH-JONGG?

13:00.988 --> 13:04.073
OKAY. "AN ASPIRIN

13:04.241 --> 13:07.410
NOW, THAT IS FUNNY.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.079
FINALLY, A SCENE
WITHOUT SEX.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.791
OH, GREAT. DRUGS.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.251
THANK YOU,
WOODY ALLEN.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.506
HUH. I GUESS
COCAINE IS EXPENSIVE.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.841
I'M FINALLY GETTING THE
FEELING BACK IN MY JAW?

13:22.009 --> 13:23.718
I DON'T GET THAT.
I MEAN, HE WAS JUST

13:23.886 --> 13:26.846
IN BED WITH HER
AND... OH! OKAY.

13:27.014 --> 13:27.889
I SEE.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.433
OH, GOD. I HOPE MY MOM
DOESN'T GET THAT.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.686
OOH. I WONDER
IF ERIC GETS THAT.

13:33.854 --> 13:37.565
WELL, I AM NOT
GONNA EXPLAIN IT TO HIM.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.032
SO NOW PATTY'S SEEIN' FEZ,
AND I JUST DON'T GET IT.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.452
'CAUSE SHE COULDA HAD ME.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.122
I'M A REAL CATCH, MAN.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.377
ALL RIGHT!
I HAD TWINS, MAN!

13:58.337 --> 14:01.422
OH, LOOK.
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!

14:02.716 --> 14:04.551
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.427
THANKS, MAN.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.555
HEY, I DON'T WANNA BE
COMPETITIVE OR ANYTHING, MAN,

14:08.722 --> 14:14.269
BUT, UH, I'VE GOT TWO KIDS,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

14:14.436 --> 14:18.231
YOU'RE JUST A LONELY
PLUMBER, DUDE.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.233
IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD,

14:20.401 --> 14:21.901
BUT IT'S FEZ.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.153
I TAUGHT HIM
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.447
IT'S ALL BACKWARDS, MAN.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.409
I GUESS YOU JUST CAN'T
DWELL ON THINGS, MAN.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.785
YEAH.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.412
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST BE HAPPY FOR FEZ.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.122
I MEAN, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN HIS WHOLE LIFE

14:34.290 --> 14:37.041
THAT HE'S EVER
HAD A GIRL, YOU KNOW.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.169
NOW, YOU KNOW, A WHILE
BACK, I PICKED UP A CARD

14:40.337 --> 14:43.506
THAT, YOU KNOW... AND I
HAD A CAR ACCIDENT...

14:43.674 --> 14:48.261
AND, UH, I WAS DWELLING
ON THAT, MAN.

14:49.221 --> 14:53.850
I'M SORRY, WHAT WERE
YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

14:54.018 --> 14:56.060
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET BACK TO WORK.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.898
IF YOU GET BACK TO WORK,
YOU'RE FIRED, MAN.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.195
HEY, I GOT TWINS
AGAIN, MAN!

15:09.241 --> 15:10.742
JUST ADMIT IT, DONNA.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.869
PATTY IS TOTALLY WRONG

15:13.037 --> 15:14.621
WELL, JACKIE,
WE'VE NEVER SEEN YOU

15:14.788 --> 15:17.457
QUITE THIS
TRANSPARENT BEFORE.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.208
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.544
SHE'S SO AWFUL,
DONNA!

15:21.712 --> 15:25.006
LET'S HATE HER
FOREVER, DONNA!

15:25.174 --> 15:26.466
LET'S SHAVE HER
HEAD AND RUN HER

15:26.634 --> 15:29.010
OUT OF TOWN, DONNA!"

15:29.178 --> 15:31.179
FOCUS, DONNA!

15:31.347 --> 15:33.890
WE'RE RAGGING ON PATTY,
REMEMBER?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.475
JACKIE, DID YOU EVER
THINK THAT MAYBE

15:35.643 --> 15:37.685
YOU HATE PATTY
BECAUSE YOU LIKE FEZ?

15:37.853 --> 15:42.649
OH, YOU ARE IN DANGEROUS
TERRITORY, PINCIOTTI.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.901
NO, I MEAN,
IT'S TRUE.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.320
YOU HATE SEEING FEZ DROOL
OVER SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOU.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.822
YOU'RE CRAZY.
I DON'T LIKE FEZ.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.366
I THINK YOU DO.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.494
OH, SHUT UP.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.664
JACKIE, YOU'RE BLUSHING!

15:58.082 --> 16:00.583
OW!

16:00.751 --> 16:02.126
I'LL ADMIT THAT, UH...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.420
FEZ WOULD BE OKAY
FOR A QUICK FLING

16:04.588 --> 16:06.172
IF I WAS OFF ON A VACATION
WITH MY PARENTS,

16:06.340 --> 16:10.385
LIKE IN MICHIGAN OR CUBA.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.595
WHERE NO ONE
WOULD EVER FIND OUT!

16:12.763 --> 16:14.764
EVER, EVER, EVER.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.351

SITTIN' IN A TREE.

16:18.519 --> 16:22.397

PLEASE SHUT UP.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.946
JACKIE, YOU ARE SO
TOTALLY HOT FOR HIM.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.116
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.119
OH, MY GOD.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.037
OH, MY GOD!

WELL, BOY, WASN'T THAT
FUN, SEEING ALL THOSE

17:00.477 --> 17:04.272

17:04.440 --> 17:08.151
OH, IT WAS SUPER-SEXY.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.820
I'M SO GLAD WE COULD
ENJOY THAT TOGETHER.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.030
REALLY, I AM.

17:12.197 --> 17:15.366
SO, I GUESS WOMEN IN NEW

I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR
YOU SAY, "NIPPLES," OKAY?

17:35.304 --> 17:39.015
WHY NOT?
MEN HAVE NIPPLES.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.309
YOUR FATHER HAS NIPPLES.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.604
NO! HE DOES NOT!

17:45.397 --> 17:51.611
