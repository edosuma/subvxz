WEBVTT

00:07.538 --> 00:11.011
ON MARCH 15th, 2010,
YOU ARE GOING TO BE MURDERED.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.285
YOUR BRIEFING--
DID IT SAY WHO KILLED ME?
I HAVE TO END THIS CALL NOW.

00:14.285 --> 00:16.187
MY DAUGHTER'S ALIVE.
HI, DAD.

00:16.187 --> 00:18.589
SHE SAW SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE...
(shouts indistinctly)

00:18.589 --> 00:21.122
AND GOT IN TROUBLE
WITH JERICHO.
(screams)

00:21.122 --> 00:23.794
THE SECOND THAT JERICHO
KNOWS THAT I'M STILL ALIVE,

00:23.794 --> 00:25.796
THEY'LL FIND ME,
AND THEY'LL KILL ME.
N.S.A. FINALLY SENT BACK A NEW
RENDERING OF SUSPECT ZERO.

00:25.796 --> 00:28.099
WHAT'S THAT ON HIS HAND?
THAT LOOKS LIKE A RING.

00:28.099 --> 00:31.432
THIS MORNING I WAS THINKING
ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE.
OH, MY GOD.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.464
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED
FOR ME NOW.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.766
WHO'S THE WOMAN?
SHE WAS IN MY VISION.

00:35.766 --> 00:39.070
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SAW THIS SYMBOL.
IT'S A JAPANESE LETTER.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.072
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
"BELIEVE."

00:45.276 --> 00:47.278
(man) SEE THERE,

00:47.278 --> 00:49.280
THERE...

00:49.280 --> 00:51.422
(typing on keyboard, beep)

00:51.422 --> 00:53.284
AND THERE.

00:53.284 --> 00:55.286
IT'S METASTASIZED.

00:55.286 --> 00:57.128
TO THE LIVER.

00:57.128 --> 00:59.390
AND NO SIGN OF IT
IN THE LUNGS OR BONES?

00:59.390 --> 01:01.362
NO.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.265
LOOK, WE HOPED THIS TREATMENT
WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE GROWTH.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.667
IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO HAVE HAD AN EFFECT.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.540
WHAT ABOUT HORMONE THERAPY?

01:09.540 --> 01:11.542
BRYCE, YOU'RE STAGE FOUR.

01:11.542 --> 01:16.677
IT'S NOT LIKELY TO DO MUCH
EXCEPT MAKE YOU FEEL LOUSY.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.679
I...

01:18.679 --> 01:20.681
I FEEL ALL RIGHT NOW.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.114
THAT'S NOT ATYPICAL
FOR THIS TYPE OF CANCER.

01:23.114 --> 01:28.119
I'M GONNA BE STRAIGHT
WITH YOU, BRYCE.

01:28.119 --> 01:30.090
WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF OPTIONS.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.863
WE COULD TRY
ANOTHER ROUND OF CHEMO.

01:32.863 --> 01:34.865
I HAVE PATIENTS
AT THIS POINT

01:34.865 --> 01:37.128
WHO HAVE GOTTEN
INTO CLINICAL TRIALS.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.601
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.604
(horn honking)

01:54.114 --> 01:56.187
(closes door)

01:56.187 --> 01:59.190
(starts engine)

02:05.656 --> 02:07.658
(click)

02:08.859 --> 02:10.901
(shifts gear)

02:12.803 --> 02:14.165
(crash)

02:18.309 --> 02:21.772
HEY!

02:23.674 --> 02:25.916
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN', MAN?

02:25.916 --> 02:28.879
(voice echoing)
DIDN'T YOU SEE ME THERE?

02:28.879 --> 02:31.652
HELLO?

02:32.653 --> 02:35.456
HELLO?
(tapping on window)

02:35.456 --> 02:36.927
(shifts gears)

02:36.927 --> 02:39.830
(tires screech)

02:41.592 --> 02:44.164
(shifts gears)

02:44.164 --> 02:47.498
(tires screech)
OH, COME ON!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! OH!

02:47.498 --> 02:50.501
ALL RIGHT. COME--COME ON!
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

02:50.501 --> 02:55.175
YOU MADE YOUR POINT!
THIS IS A CHERRY '63 T-BIRD!

02:55.175 --> 02:58.949
OH! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I WANT
TO REPORT A HIT AND RUN.

02:58.949 --> 03:03.284
HE'S STILL HITTING ME!

03:03.284 --> 03:05.286
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. OKAY.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.288
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.893
YOU ARE SO DEAD, MAN.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.695
YOU HEAR ME?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.497
YOU'RE DEAD!

03:16.497 --> 03:26.537
â™ªâ™ª

03:26.537 --> 03:34.585
â™ªâ™ª

03:34.585 --> 03:36.247
OH.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.249
(sighs)

03:42.923 --> 03:44.855
(door opens)

03:44.855 --> 03:46.427
(door closes)

03:46.427 --> 03:49.760
ARAHIDA KEIKO-SAN?

03:49.760 --> 03:50.901
(speaking Japanese)

03:50.901 --> 03:52.933
(speaking Japanese)

04:39.950 --> 04:41.882
(chuckles)

05:13.884 --> 05:16.947
(monitor beeping)
(Olivia) BRYCE,
SHE'S OOZING AN AWFUL LOT.

05:16.947 --> 05:20.020
NO, IT'S--
WHAT WAS HER PLATELET COUNT,
HEMOGLOBIN AND COAGS PREOP?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.523
UM... I'M SORRY.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.726
HER PLATELETS WERE, UH...

05:25.726 --> 05:28.759
UM...
PLATELETS 80,000,
HEMOGLOBIN 10.5.

05:28.759 --> 05:31.932
LOOKS LIKE A CIRRHOTIC TO ME.
IS SHE A DRINKER, DR. VARLEY?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.905
UH, SORRY, UM...

05:34.905 --> 05:38.108
UH, MANEESH,
I'M GONNA NEED SOME F.F.P.

05:38.108 --> 05:40.471
AND 2 UNITS OF
PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS

05:40.471 --> 05:41.872
AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET 'EM.

05:41.872 --> 05:45.345
SHE'S OOZING EVERYWHERE WE CUT.
SEND A D.I.C. PANEL

05:45.345 --> 05:48.078
AND, UH, HANG A BANANA BAG
WITH 2 GRAMS OF MAG.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.856
(water running)

05:59.660 --> 06:01.862
DR. BENFORD, I'M SORRY.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.864
(scrubbing)

06:06.867 --> 06:08.869
I THINK YOU NEED
TO THINK SERIOUSLY

06:08.869 --> 06:12.002
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
COMMITTED TO THIS PROFESSION.

06:26.817 --> 06:29.820
(door creaks)

06:37.998 --> 06:39.970
(people shout in Japanese)

06:39.970 --> 06:41.972
OHH.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.610
(sighs)

06:49.610 --> 06:52.412
(all shout in Japanese)

07:43.534 --> 07:46.597
(Bryce) I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I BELONG.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.599
I'M NOT A VERY GOOD DOCTOR.

07:48.599 --> 07:51.542
I NEVER HAVE BEEN, REALLY.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.604
IT WASN'T
WHAT YOU WANTED?

07:53.604 --> 07:55.976
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.908
MM.

07:57.908 --> 08:01.652
I JUST... DID IT...

08:01.652 --> 08:03.954
(seagulls calling)

08:03.954 --> 08:07.487
AND NOW I'M HERE.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.260
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR FAMILY,

08:10.260 --> 08:12.663
YOUR COLLEAGUES
ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS?

08:12.663 --> 08:16.096
MY FAMILY'S BEEN THROUGH
ENOUGH, DR. FLEMMING.

08:16.096 --> 08:20.270
WITH MY DAD DYING OF
LUNG CANCER FOR THREE YEARS...

08:20.270 --> 08:22.673
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

08:22.673 --> 08:26.076
WHAT ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUES?
SURELY THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.108
I DON'T WANT THEIR PITY.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.942
PITY? BRYCE, YOU NEED
SUPPORT RIGHT NOW.

08:31.942 --> 08:34.084
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA
GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

08:34.084 --> 08:36.917
NOTHING IS GONNA
GET ME THROUGH THIS.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.650
MY DIAGNOSIS IS TERMINAL.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.923
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.995
NONE OF US DO, REALLY.

08:44.995 --> 08:48.098
YOUR JOB IS TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, BRYCE,

08:48.098 --> 08:51.832
TO TRY AND HAVE THE BEST LIFE
YOU CAN FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

08:51.832 --> 08:56.006
LIVE EACH DAY
DOING WHAT FEELS RIGHT.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.665
(whoosh)

09:59.169 --> 10:02.002
(indistinct conversations)

10:26.927 --> 10:29.259
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

11:17.107 --> 11:19.109
(whoosh)

11:28.919 --> 11:31.922
(water running)

11:40.300 --> 11:43.303
(laughing)

11:53.113 --> 11:56.747
(woman) PLEASED TO MEET YOU--
HAJIMEMASHITE.

11:56.747 --> 11:58.849
HAJIMEMASHITE.

11:58.849 --> 12:03.023
PLEASE SPEAK MORE SLOWLY--
YUKKURI HANASHITE KUDASAI.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.126
YUKKURI HANASHITE KUDASAI.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.159
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
O NAMAE WA NAN DESU KA?

12:09.159 --> 12:12.132
O NAMAE WA NAN... DESU KA?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.134
(clears throat)

12:14.134 --> 12:16.406
I LOVE YOU--
SUKI DESU.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.408
SUKI DESU. SUKI--

12:18.408 --> 12:21.041
PLEASE SIT DOWN--
OKAKEKUDASAI.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.413
(retching)

12:23.413 --> 12:26.947
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.979
GOKIGEN IKADA DESU KA?
(groaning)

12:28.979 --> 12:30.120
(flushes toilet)

12:30.120 --> 12:33.023
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL...

12:33.023 --> 12:35.525
(speaking Japanese)

12:35.525 --> 12:39.890
CAN YOU GIVE ME
THE DIRECTIONS?

12:39.890 --> 12:43.463
(speaking Japanese)

12:43.463 --> 12:47.097
I AM LOST.

12:47.097 --> 12:50.370
MICHI NI MAYOTTE IMASU.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.343
WHO ARE YOU?

12:53.343 --> 12:56.807
ANATA WA DARE DESU KA?

12:56.807 --> 12:59.109
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:59.109 --> 13:02.182
NANI O OMOTOME DESU KA?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.061
(cell phone rings)

13:16.867 --> 13:18.098
YEAH?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.900
HEY, HOW'S TRACY?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.974
SHE'S, UH...
SHE'S PRETTY SHUT DOWN.

13:23.974 --> 13:26.276
Terrified Jericho's
gonna come and find her.

13:26.276 --> 13:30.841
WELL, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
INTO THAT FOR YOU.

13:30.841 --> 13:31.982
Yeah?

13:31.982 --> 13:34.114
YEAH.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.116
UNFORTUNATELY,
PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTORS

13:36.116 --> 13:40.190
LIKE JERICHO AND BLACKWATER
ARE HARDER TO BREAK INTO

13:40.190 --> 13:42.352
than Fort Knox.

13:42.352 --> 13:44.354
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

13:44.354 --> 13:46.957
Yeah, but this outfit's
headquartered in Santa Monica,

13:46.957 --> 13:49.960
right in our own backyard,
working out...

13:49.960 --> 13:53.934
(bottles clink)
of the Burroughs Foundation
for International Peace--

13:53.934 --> 13:57.868
some kind of think tank.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.439
THINK TANK?
Yep.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.112
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HIGHER
SECURITY CLEARANCE THAN I HAVE

14:02.112 --> 14:04.214
AT THIS POINT
TO GET MUCH BEYOND THAT.
(cell phone ringing)

14:04.214 --> 14:06.046
HOLD ON A SEC.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.979
Hey, Livvie,
your phone's ringing.
(Olivia)
Babe, can you get it?

14:08.979 --> 14:12.923
I GOTTA GO. I'LL PUT OUT
SOME MORE FEELERS, ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.893
(Olivia) WHO IS IT?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.269
WHO WAS IT?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.041
WHAT IS THIS?

14:31.041 --> 14:34.144
(sighs)

14:34.144 --> 14:36.146
IT'S THIS WEIRD TEXT
I GOT.

14:36.146 --> 14:39.349
WHO... WHO SENT IT?

14:39.349 --> 14:41.611
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:41.611 --> 14:46.616
YOU FIGURED YOU
WOULDN'T MENTION IT?

14:46.616 --> 14:49.159
WELL, YOU ALREADY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE DRINKING.

14:49.159 --> 14:51.161
BEFORE I GOT A CHANCE
TO BRING IT UP.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.163
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE TALKED
ABOUT IT,

14:53.163 --> 14:56.026
THE PHONE THING DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE SUCH A BIG DEAL.

14:56.026 --> 14:58.028
I GOTTA GET DRESSED.

15:04.074 --> 15:07.307
HEY, BRYCE.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.309
NICE JOB
WITH THAT TENSION PNEUMO.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.081
(sighs) THANKS.

15:11.081 --> 15:13.113
(clears throat, sniffles)

15:13.113 --> 15:14.144
YOU OKAY?

15:14.144 --> 15:16.646
YEAH, YEAH.

15:16.646 --> 15:18.148
YOU LOOK SICK.

15:18.148 --> 15:19.349
I'M OKAY.

15:19.349 --> 15:20.650
COME HERE.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.253
I'M--I'M ALL RIGHT.
(sniffles)

15:23.253 --> 15:25.996
YOU'RE NOT FEBRILE,
BUT YOU'RE REALLY PALE.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.228
GO HOME. I'LL HAVE CYNTHIA
COVER YOUR SHIFT.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.630
I'LL BE OKAY.
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.033
BRYCE, HEY, HEY, HEY,
COME HERE.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.005
WHOA. COME SIT.

15:35.005 --> 15:36.636
I'M JUST--
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.539
I'M JUST TIRED. I'M...

15:39.539 --> 15:41.541
GRAPHIA SAYS
YOU ALMOST PASSED OUT

15:41.541 --> 15:43.543
DURING GRAND ROUNDS
LAST WEEK.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.615
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:45.615 --> 15:47.617
IT'S NOTHING.

15:49.579 --> 15:52.722
OH, WE--WE DON'T NEED
TO--TO DO THAT.
COME ON.

15:56.586 --> 15:59.189
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A CENTRAL LINE?

15:59.189 --> 16:02.032
UH...

16:02.032 --> 16:04.694
IT'S FOR THE CHEMO.

16:04.694 --> 16:08.068
CHEMO?

16:10.340 --> 16:12.172
I HAVE...

16:12.172 --> 16:16.146
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA.

16:16.146 --> 16:17.647
STAGE FOUR.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.553
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

16:23.553 --> 16:28.118
UM, ABOUT A YEAR.

16:28.118 --> 16:30.420
HAD MY KIDNEY OUT
JUST BEFORE I STARTED HERE.

16:33.463 --> 16:36.166
THIS IS WHY YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF THAT--

16:36.166 --> 16:38.068
OH, BRYCE.

16:41.071 --> 16:42.602
I WAS TERRIFIED.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.676
I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD
FACE THE PROSPECT OF DYING.

16:46.676 --> 16:51.441
I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
MY FAMILY THROUGH THAT.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.586
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN
GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE.

16:56.586 --> 16:58.788
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

16:58.788 --> 17:02.052
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT BAD
SO FAR.

17:02.052 --> 17:05.125
IT'S ROUGH FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER
CHEMO, BUT THEN I BOUNCE BACK.

17:05.125 --> 17:09.759
ANYWAY, SINCE THE BLACKOUT,
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.701
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

17:13.363 --> 17:16.506
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO LIVE FOR.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.116
IT'S HOT.

17:28.118 --> 17:29.719
I FORGOT THE CHEESE.

17:29.719 --> 17:31.721
I DON'T NEED THE CHEESE.

17:33.183 --> 17:36.356
THIS SMELLS GREAT.
WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.359
THIS CRAZY STAFF SERGEANT
IN MY DETAIL MADE THE BEST FOOD

17:39.359 --> 17:42.732
I EVER THREW A LIP ON.
(dishes clatter)

17:56.606 --> 17:57.747
WHAT?

17:57.747 --> 18:00.150
I CAN'T DO THIS.

18:00.150 --> 18:01.381
DO WHAT?

18:03.753 --> 18:06.386
(bottle clanks)

18:06.386 --> 18:08.388
HAVE YOU DRINKING HERE.

18:13.523 --> 18:16.496
IT'S JUST
A GLASS OF WINE.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.568
(bottle scrapes table)

18:21.571 --> 18:24.834
DOESN'T MATTER.
A GLASS OF WINE

18:24.834 --> 18:29.139
OR A FIFTH OF VODKA--

18:29.139 --> 18:31.711
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME.

18:31.711 --> 18:35.315
COME ON, DAD. RELAX.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DRINK.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.317
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.620
I CAN'T BE IN THE SAME ROOM
AS IT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.622
AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

18:42.622 --> 18:45.355
YOU'RE TELLING ME
I CAN'T HAVE A GLASS OF WINE?

18:45.355 --> 18:48.628
I'M 24 YEARS OLD,
AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
I CAN'T HAVE A DRINK?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.633
BABY, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU CAN OR CAN'T DO.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.336
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I CAN'T DO.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.840
THIS IS GOOD.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.912
(fork clinking bowl)

19:08.318 --> 19:11.451
FINE.
I'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:17.327 --> 19:20.890
(fork clatters,
door opens and closes)

19:20.890 --> 19:24.834
THE N.S.A.'s DIGITAL FORENSICS
TEAM UNCOVERED THIS SYMBOL

19:24.834 --> 19:26.336
ON SUSPECT ZERO'S RING.

19:26.336 --> 19:27.597
(Wedeck) ALPHA.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.599
AND IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING--

19:29.599 --> 19:31.441
THE ANGLE OF ATTACK
IN AERODYNAMICS,

19:31.441 --> 19:33.343
THE BRIGHTEST STAR
IN A CONSTELLATION.

19:33.343 --> 19:35.345
ALPHA IS THE BEGINNING
OF EVERYTHING.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.847
IF WE CAN ENHANCE
THE RING SO WELL,

19:37.847 --> 19:39.679
WHY CAN'T WE SEE
HIS FACE?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.781
WE TRIED TO REBUILD
THAT IMAGE

19:41.781 --> 19:44.554
FROM ALL THE VARIOUS
CAMERA ANGLES THAT WE GOT.
(beeping)

19:44.554 --> 19:47.186
BUT IN ONE,
HIS SKIN WAS ALL BLOWN OUT.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.919
IN ANOTHER, IT WAS
A RAKING PROFILE AND SO ON.

19:49.919 --> 19:51.791
THE RING WAS MUCH EASIER.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.593
IT HAS HARD EDGES
AND A REFLECTIVE SURFACE.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.796
WE CAPTURED STILL IMAGES
AS THE HAND MOVED.
(beeping)

19:56.796 --> 20:01.231
WE REPLACED PIXELS AND THEN
BUILT A 3-D MODEL OF IT.

20:01.231 --> 20:04.234
FRANKLY, WE WERE HOPING
THE N.S.A. WOULD PROVIDE US

20:04.234 --> 20:07.877
AN ANALYSIS OF THE RING THAT
WAS A LITTLE MORE SUBSTANTIAL.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.810
(sighs) TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M--I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

20:10.810 --> 20:13.583
TALKING
IN THIS PARTICULAR GROUP.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.844
UNCOMFORTABLE?

20:14.844 --> 20:17.847
LOOK, MRS. LEVY, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES.

20:17.847 --> 20:19.849
OKAY, I'LL BE BLUNT,
MR. WEDECK.

20:19.849 --> 20:22.352
ONE OF THE MEMBERS
OF YOUR MOSAIC TASK FORCE

20:22.352 --> 20:24.624
HAS BEEN RED-FLAGGED
BY THE N.S.A.

20:26.396 --> 20:29.228
WHAT? WHO?

20:31.401 --> 20:34.404
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,
OUR WIRETAPPING PROGRAM

20:34.404 --> 20:35.935
INTERCEPTED A PHONE CALL

20:35.935 --> 20:38.738
WHOSE ORIGINS HAD BEEN
PROFESSIONALLY CONCEALED

20:38.738 --> 20:41.671
TO A BUREAU CELL PHONE.
WHOSE PHONE?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.575
AGENT NOH'S.

20:45.575 --> 20:48.017
SINCE WHEN DO YOU GUYS
WIRETAP THE FBI?

20:48.017 --> 20:50.350
HOMELAND SECURITY
IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.283
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HOMELAND SECURITY IS THE--
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

20:53.283 --> 20:55.625
MAYBE IT'S THE CALL--
YOUR CALL FROM THE WOMAN.
ABOUT YOUR MURDER.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.758
(Mark) RIGHT.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.592
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU HAVE
A RECORDING OF THAT CALL?

21:04.534 --> 21:07.036
HOW DO I GET IT?
I'M SORRY.

21:07.036 --> 21:09.369
IT'S CLASSIFIED SIGINT--
SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.040
THE WOMAN WHO MADE THAT CALL

21:11.040 --> 21:13.473
TOLD ME I WAS GONNA BE
MURDERED ON MARCH 15th.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.946
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION

21:16.946 --> 21:20.310
ON WHO THAT WAS
OR WHY I'M GOING TO BE KILLED--
I'M NOT AUTHORIZED TO--

21:20.310 --> 21:23.883
COME ON! CALL WHOEVER YOU NEED
TO CALL TO MAKE IT HAPPEN THEN!

21:23.883 --> 21:25.915
HOW ABOUT THAT, MS. LEVY?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.894
LET ME MAKE A CALL.

21:41.831 --> 21:43.633
(horns honking in distance)

21:43.633 --> 21:46.636
(woman speaking Japanese
over P.A.)

21:49.579 --> 21:52.582
(whirring)

22:13.963 --> 22:15.334
(whoosh)

22:28.017 --> 22:30.920
(taps key)
(playing
"Shelter from the Storm")

22:30.920 --> 22:34.584
â™ª 'TWAS IN ANOTHER LIFETIME â™ª

22:34.584 --> 22:37.887
â™ª ONE OF TOIL AND BLOOD,
WHEN BLACKNESS WAS A VIRTUE â™ª

22:37.887 --> 22:40.460
â™ª AND THE ROAD WAS FULL
OF MUD â™ª

22:40.460 --> 22:42.061
â™ª I CAME IN
FROM THE WILDERNESS â™ª

22:42.061 --> 22:44.594
â™ª A CREATURE VOID OF FORM â™ª

22:44.594 --> 22:46.896
â™ª "COME IN," SHE SAID,
"I'LL GIVE YA â™ª

22:46.896 --> 22:48.898
â™ª SHELTER FROM THE STORM" â™ª

22:48.898 --> 22:52.001
â™ªâ™ª

23:07.987 --> 23:09.859
(man speaks Japanese)

23:26.976 --> 23:30.880
(Nakahara continues
speaking Japanese)

23:39.088 --> 23:42.622
(Nakahara continues
speaking Japanese)

23:54.804 --> 23:57.036
BENJO WA...

23:57.036 --> 23:59.168
DOKO...

23:59.168 --> 24:00.910
DESU KA LOS ANGELES?

24:00.910 --> 24:04.043
YOU JUST SAID "WHERE IS
THE TOILET, LOS ANGELES?"

24:04.043 --> 24:06.916
LET ME SEE THAT BOOK
A SEC.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.218
IT'S SO COOL YOU'RE LEARNING
A WHOLE LANGUAGE

24:09.218 --> 24:12.021
FOR SOMEONE
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN MET.

24:12.021 --> 24:15.525
BUT I AM GONNA MEET HER.
I KNOW IT.

24:16.986 --> 24:20.890
WOW. I'M HEARING MYSELF,
AND I SOUND CRAZY.

24:20.890 --> 24:25.735
BUT IT'S A GOOD KIND
OF CRAZY. LOVE CRAZY.

24:25.735 --> 24:27.667
YOU THINK?

24:27.667 --> 24:32.001
(applause)

24:32.001 --> 24:35.775
(indistinct conversations)

24:35.775 --> 24:37.707
HEY.

24:37.707 --> 24:40.249
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.
YEAH, I CAME IN LATE.

24:40.249 --> 24:42.081
YEAH? WHAT'S UP?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.054
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING,
AARON.

24:45.054 --> 24:47.056
THINGS WERE GOING GREAT
AT HOME,

24:47.056 --> 24:49.158
OR BETTER AT LEAST.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.920
THEN THIS THING HAPPENED.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.162
SOMEONE SENT OLIVIA A TEXT,

24:53.162 --> 24:55.895
TELLING HER I WAS DRINKING
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.997
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

24:57.997 --> 25:01.070
I DON'T KNOW.
I ONLY TOLD TWO PEOPLE.

25:01.070 --> 25:04.534
IT'S KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT,
YOU KNOW?

25:04.534 --> 25:05.975
THAT'S WEIRD.

25:05.975 --> 25:09.078
YEAH.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.914
YOU TRYING TO SAY
SOMETHING TO ME, MARK?

25:14.914 --> 25:18.588
LIKE I SAID, UH,

25:18.588 --> 25:21.791
I ONLY TOLD TWO PEOPLE.

25:29.959 --> 25:32.261
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOURS
I'VE SPENT

25:32.261 --> 25:35.805
LISTENING TO YOUR CRAP,
YOUR DOUBT, YOUR SELF-PITY?

25:35.805 --> 25:37.567
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MY SPONSOR.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.770
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T
MEAN I'M YOUR PUNCHING BAG.

25:40.770 --> 25:43.272
I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO ASK YOU

25:43.272 --> 25:45.975
IF YOU'RE COMMUNICATING
WITH MY WIFE BEHIND MY BACK.

25:45.975 --> 25:47.977
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.853
AFTER ALL THE TIME
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER,

25:53.853 --> 25:55.955
YOU THINK I WOULD DO THAT?

25:55.955 --> 25:58.828
(scoffs) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE.

25:58.828 --> 26:00.990
YOU DON'T KNOW.

26:07.997 --> 26:09.298
(clatter)

26:14.944 --> 26:16.075
DON'T KNOW.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.948
HERE'S SOME FOOD
FOR THOUGHT.

26:18.948 --> 26:22.251
WHY DON'T YOU GET
A NEW SPONSOR?

26:22.251 --> 26:24.854
SOMEONE YOU CAN
REALLY TRUST.

26:30.019 --> 26:31.190
(door slams)

26:38.167 --> 26:40.800
(horns honking in distance)

26:40.800 --> 26:43.803
(men singing in Japanese)

26:43.803 --> 26:46.806
(needle buzzing)

27:00.950 --> 27:02.952
(scoffs)

27:13.763 --> 27:14.834
(scoffs)

27:31.180 --> 27:34.954
â™ªâ™ª

27:36.726 --> 27:38.728
GOT IT.

27:38.728 --> 27:39.829
WHAT?

27:39.829 --> 27:41.130
DEMETRI'S PHONE CALL.

27:41.130 --> 27:44.363
TAKING IT DOWN TO
AUDIO FORENSICS RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.937
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
WHAT?

27:47.937 --> 27:51.200
DID YOU SEND OLIVIA
A TEXT?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.902
YOUR WIFE?
UH-HUH.

27:52.902 --> 27:55.004
WHY WOULD I SEND YOUR WIFE
A TEXT?

27:55.004 --> 27:58.708
WELL, SOMEONE DID.
(chuckles)

27:58.708 --> 28:00.980
TELLING HER I WAS DRUNK
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

28:00.980 --> 28:06.956
YOU'RE ONE OF ONLY
TWO PEOPLE I'VE TOLD.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.060
SO?

28:11.060 --> 28:15.895
SO AS, UH, I RECALL
YOU WERE PRETTY PISSED

28:15.895 --> 28:19.198
THAT I WAS DRINKING
AND THE IMPLICATIONS

28:19.198 --> 28:21.300
THAT HAD FOR
OUR INVESTIGATION.

28:21.300 --> 28:25.975
OH, I SEE. YOU WERE THINKING
I WAS SO ANGRY AND SO PETTY

28:25.975 --> 28:29.438
THAT I'D RUN OUT
AND TEXT YOUR WIFE ABOUT IT?

28:31.040 --> 28:33.042
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE,
BENFORD.

28:33.042 --> 28:35.915
I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

28:39.989 --> 28:43.192
KONNICHIWA.
OGENKI DESU KA?

28:43.192 --> 28:45.855
GENKU DESU. ANATA WA?

28:45.855 --> 28:48.998
YOUR ACCENT IS REALLY IMPROVING,
DR. VARLEY.

28:48.998 --> 28:53.162
DOMO ARIGATO, KONDO-SAN.

28:53.162 --> 28:55.004
WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE,

28:55.004 --> 28:58.037
I'LL COME OUT OF THIS HAVING
LEARNED A SECOND LANGUAGE.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.339
SO HOW'S THE SEARCH
FOR YOUR YOUNG WOMAN?

29:00.339 --> 29:03.042
WELL, NO RESPONSE
TO MY MOSAIC POSTING YET,

29:03.042 --> 29:05.945
BUT I DID FINISH
MY DRAWING.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.947
YOU WANNA SEE IT?

29:07.947 --> 29:11.981
SHE'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

29:11.981 --> 29:15.084
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
POSTING IT ON THE WEB.

29:15.084 --> 29:18.928
WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE LIKES TO EAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:20.189 --> 29:21.931
SUSHI ARAHIDA.

29:21.931 --> 29:25.965
IT'S A RESTAURANT IN TSUKUBA,
NOT THAT FAR FROM TOKYO.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.766
I TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.769
IS IT POSSIBLE THERE'S MORE THAN
ONE RESTAURANT WITH THIS NAME

29:30.769 --> 29:32.842
IN... TSUKUBA?

29:32.842 --> 29:35.044
WELL, I DOUBT IT,
NOT WITH THIS SAME LOGO.

29:35.044 --> 29:39.979
IT'S A LITTLE, TINY PLACE.
SHE'S PROBABLY A LOCAL.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.112
MS. KONDO,
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

29:43.112 --> 29:45.784
I WAS SITTING
IN A JAPANESE RESTAURANT.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.556
MAYBE IT'S
THIS SUSHI ARAHIDA.

29:47.556 --> 29:50.119
MAYBE.
THANK YOU!

29:50.119 --> 29:53.162
ARIGATO, KONDO-SAN.
ARIGATO.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.026
OH, BRYCE?

29:57.026 --> 29:59.528
DR. VARLEY,
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YEAH.

29:59.528 --> 30:02.571
HEY. UH, SO LISTEN,
MAYBE IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

30:02.571 --> 30:05.935
BUT I MADE A FEW CALLS,
DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH,

30:05.935 --> 30:09.438
AND THERE REALLY ARE
SOME GOOD OPTIONS OUT THERE.
OH, DR. BENFORD,
I DON'T THINK--

30:09.438 --> 30:12.241
THERE'S THIS FRIEND OF MINE
FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL

30:12.241 --> 30:15.084
WHO'S RUNNING AN EXPERIMENTAL
TRIAL WITH TRIFECTUMAB OUT OF

30:15.084 --> 30:18.487
M.D. ANDERSON IN HOUSTON,
SO I MADE A CALL, AND YOU'RE IN.

30:18.487 --> 30:21.490
THANK YOU.
NO. YOU KIDDING?
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.153
HERE.

30:24.153 --> 30:27.426
I'VE, UH, I'VE READ
ABOUT TRIFECTUMAB.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.229
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
THE SIDE EFFECTS, THOUGH.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.932
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR LIFE.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.234
NOW'S NOT THE TIME
TO BE CONSERVATIVE.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.936
DR. BENFORD, THANK YOU.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.938
UM, BUT--BUT YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:38.938 --> 30:42.441
UH... BECAUSE
OF MY FLASH-FORWARD,

30:42.441 --> 30:45.074
I KNOW THAT I HAVE
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.

30:45.074 --> 30:49.078
I CAN'T TAKE A DRUG THAT MIGHT
KILL ME OR MAKE ME SICKER.

30:49.078 --> 30:52.581
OKAY, BRYCE, YOU'RE ONLY
GONNA HEAR ME SAY THIS ONCE.

30:52.581 --> 30:55.484
MAYBE THE REASON YOU'RE ALIVE
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD

30:55.484 --> 30:59.128
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
THIS DRUG AND GET BETTER.

30:59.128 --> 31:01.891
BRYCE, DON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

31:01.891 --> 31:05.194
PLEASE. COME HERE.

31:05.194 --> 31:07.496
GO TO HOUSTON.

31:07.496 --> 31:11.040
YOU NEED A COUPLE OF DAYS,
TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS.

31:12.341 --> 31:15.244
(roaring)

31:24.513 --> 31:28.087
(woman speaks Japanese
over P.A.)

31:42.201 --> 31:44.433
(door bells jingle)

32:31.150 --> 32:34.123
UM...

32:34.123 --> 32:37.056
UH, UM...

32:41.560 --> 32:42.631
UH...

32:58.307 --> 33:02.381
UM... UH...

33:13.692 --> 33:15.024
KEIKO?

34:06.415 --> 34:09.047
(whoosh)

34:19.358 --> 34:21.560
(woman) There is
no delicate way to say this,

34:21.560 --> 34:26.735
but on March 15, 2010,

34:26.735 --> 34:29.538
you are going to be murdered.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.073
WOW, IT'S EVEN WORSE
HEARING IT A SECOND TIME.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.075
WE'VE ANALYZED
THE AMBIENT NOISE,

34:37.075 --> 34:40.249
AND WE'VE COME UP
WITH A POTENTIAL LEAD.

34:40.249 --> 34:42.711
LEAD? WHAT KIND OF A LEAD?
LISTEN TO THIS.

34:42.711 --> 34:46.155
...in response
to your Mosaic...
NOW, I STRIPPED AWAY
EVERYTHING

34:46.155 --> 34:49.188
BUT THE BACKGROUND NOISE.
...but on March 15th...

34:49.188 --> 34:50.519
â™ªâ™ª

34:50.519 --> 34:52.090
WE FOUND--

34:52.090 --> 34:54.193
YOU FOUND CHEESY ELECTRONIC
MUSIC. COME ON, VREEDE.

34:54.193 --> 34:58.096
OH, NO, NO, NOT JUST ANY CHEESY
ELECTRONIC MUSIC, MY FRIEND.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.169
IT'S
THE "SYMPHONY OF LIGHTS,"

35:00.169 --> 35:02.671
THE WORLD'S LARGEST OUTDOOR
LIGHT AND MUSIC SHOW.

35:02.671 --> 35:07.276
PLAYS EVERY NIGHT
IN HONG KONG HARBOUR.

35:07.276 --> 35:09.778
â™ªâ™ª

35:09.778 --> 35:12.181
WANNA TAKE A LITTLE TRIP?

35:12.181 --> 35:15.184
(Wedeck) I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST
CAN'T SEND YOU TO CHINA

35:15.184 --> 35:18.187
AFTER THAT CIA IDIOT ACCUSED
THEM OF CAUSING THE BLACKOUT.

35:18.187 --> 35:19.718
RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES

35:19.718 --> 35:21.720
ARE TENSE ENOUGH AS IT IS.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.193
LOOK, I WANT TO SOLVE
DEMETRI'S POTENTIAL MURDER

35:24.193 --> 35:27.196
AS MUCH AS ANYONE, BUT EVEN IF
SHE MADE THE CALL FROM HONG KONG

35:27.196 --> 35:29.198
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY
THAT SHE'S STILL--

35:29.198 --> 35:31.630
SHE CONCEALED THE ORIGINS
OF THE CALL, STAN.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.863
THAT ALONE MAKES HER A SUSPECT.
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS
AND WHAT ELSE SHE KNOWS.

35:34.863 --> 35:37.866
LOOK, I PROMISE YOU, I'LL HAVE
OUR LEGATS GUY IN ASIA

35:37.866 --> 35:40.509
TRY AND TRACK HER DOWN,
BUT I NEED YOU HERE.

35:40.509 --> 35:43.212
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HONG KONG.
END OF STORY.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.379
HEY.

35:50.379 --> 35:51.850
WE'RE GOING.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.852
WHAT?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.454
HONG KONG.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.157
WEDECK'S GONNA BE PISSED.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.860
MM-HMM.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.792
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

36:12.201 --> 36:13.902
(door creaks)

36:18.377 --> 36:21.380
(Japanese TV program
playing indistinctly)

36:24.853 --> 36:27.216
(girl) HAI.

36:27.216 --> 36:29.288
(footsteps approach)

36:53.282 --> 36:55.544
UM, I'M SORRY.

36:55.544 --> 36:58.917
(people speaking Japanese,
laughter on TV,)

36:58.917 --> 37:01.350
IS THIS YOUR DAUGHTER,

37:01.350 --> 37:03.752
MUSUME-SAN?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.703
IS THIS YOUR DAUGHTER?
UH...

37:14.703 --> 37:16.004
IS THIS YOUR SISTER?

37:16.004 --> 37:18.467
THEY TOLD ME AT THE RESTAURANT
THAT SHE LIVED HERE.

37:18.467 --> 37:22.941
PLEASE, I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM
LOS ANGELES. IS THIS KEIKO?

37:22.941 --> 37:26.315
DO YOU KNOW KEIKO?
KEIKO, PLEASE.

37:49.498 --> 37:50.839
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

37:50.839 --> 37:53.972
I TRAVEL MORE THAN 5,000 MILES
BECAUSE OF A T-SHIRT?

37:53.972 --> 37:57.976
What was I thinking?
YOU WERE THINKING YOU WERE GOING
TO FIND THE WOMAN YOU LOVE.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.379
BUT I DIDN'T.
Now you know her name.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.612
THAT'S SOMETHING.
I don't even know
if it's her real name.

38:03.612 --> 38:07.055
I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY.
I WENT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT.

38:07.055 --> 38:09.057
NO ONE CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

38:09.057 --> 38:11.890
I don't know how long
I can wait, Nicole.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.993
Maybe you're just trying to rush
things that can't be rushed.

38:14.993 --> 38:19.368
SOMETIMES YOU JUST
GOTTA BE PATIENT.

38:19.368 --> 38:21.970
Isn't that how love works?

38:23.872 --> 38:26.575
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I
MISINTERPRETED THE WHOLE THING.

38:26.575 --> 38:29.908
MAYBE IT'S...
IT'S JUST SOME KIND OF FANTASY

38:29.908 --> 38:33.882
and a really good way
to run away from my life.

38:33.882 --> 38:35.884
BRYCE, COME HOME.

38:37.346 --> 38:39.948
Come home.

38:49.798 --> 38:52.030
(knock on door)

39:09.347 --> 39:11.950
HEY. CAN I COME IN?

39:11.950 --> 39:14.352
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.685
TO TALK.

39:23.592 --> 39:24.893
(sighs)

39:24.893 --> 39:26.935
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

39:26.935 --> 39:29.137
YEAH, YOU WERE.

39:29.137 --> 39:31.540
I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE STRESSED.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.472
FOR GOD SAKES, MARK.

39:33.472 --> 39:37.145
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S DEALING WITH ISSUES?
OF COURSE I DON'T.

39:37.145 --> 39:40.949
I KNOW YOU'RE DEALING
WITH THE WHOLE TRACY THING--
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH,

39:40.949 --> 39:43.982
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUT THE HELL UP, OKAY?

39:45.814 --> 39:49.117
YEAH, TRACY'S BACK, BUT SHE'S
NOT THE PERSON SHE USED TO BE.

39:49.117 --> 39:51.560
THAT PERSON IS DEAD.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.823
AARON, AARON--

39:54.823 --> 39:55.964
NO, YOU...

39:58.597 --> 40:00.469
YOU DON'T GET IT.

40:00.469 --> 40:02.601
SHE'S BROKEN,

40:02.601 --> 40:04.433
ANGRY, SCARED.

40:04.433 --> 40:07.075
SHE DRINKS HERSELF TO SLEEP
EVERY NIGHT.

40:07.075 --> 40:09.978
SHE'S A MESSED UP ALCOHOLIC,
MARK.

40:09.978 --> 40:13.982
AND I'M TO BLAME...
FOR ALL OF IT.

40:13.982 --> 40:17.716
SHE ENLISTED BECAUSE SHE
WANTED TO BE JUST LIKE ME.

40:19.888 --> 40:27.025
AND NOW SHE DRINKS
JUST LIKE ME.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.928
THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING
THAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

40:37.766 --> 40:38.937
(sniffles)

40:41.510 --> 40:44.813
LOOK, WE'VE CROSSED
A LINE HERE...

40:44.813 --> 40:47.846
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.

40:47.846 --> 40:51.980
SO, UH...

40:51.980 --> 40:54.983
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE
YOUR SPONSOR ANYMORE, MARK.

40:54.983 --> 40:57.556
I'M SORRY.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.158
(voice breaking) BUT I COULD
REALLY USE A FRIEND.

41:04.733 --> 41:08.036
YOU GOT IT.

41:08.036 --> 41:11.069
(roaring)

41:11.069 --> 41:14.703
(woman) WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES.
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

41:14.703 --> 41:16.545
WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES.
