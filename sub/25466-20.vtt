09:40.710 --> 09:42.582
No!

09:48.109 --> 09:50.633
Friends, you saved me from
the greed and the corruption

09:50.677 --> 09:53.375
I learned from the innocent
youth organization.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.594
We're glad you escaped

09:54.637 --> 09:56.030
the clutches of
the business world, Star.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.814
It's a shame we had to destroy

09:57.858 --> 10:00.208
all of those
delicious cookies.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.210
Yo, what's up with
your butt, Robin?

10:02.253 --> 10:05.561
Oh, I, uh, put on
some extra weight
eating all of those cookies.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.519
Holds up, are those...

10:07.563 --> 10:10.044
What...
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Uh...

10:10.087 --> 10:11.785
RAVEN: Get him!
ROBIN: Ow, ow! Ahhh!

-Whoa! Ow, ow! Ouch!

10:13.743 --> 10:15.310
Stop! Ow, too hard! Ow!
