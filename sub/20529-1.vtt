01:34.428 --> 01:37.717
Move your fat ass, you A-town motherfucker.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.846
Shut the fuck up, Bernie.
My fucking head's about to explode here.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.847
That guy sure messed you up.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.972
Yeah, well, I ever see him again, he's dead.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.108
Not so pretty now, hey, pretty boy?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.776
I look like I tried to fuck
a reluctant panda bear.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.741
Yeah, well, you did worse than that, huh?

01:59.202 --> 02:02.366
Oh, don't fucking talk about it.
It didn't happen, okay?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.916
- Where the fuck are they?
- It's okay.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.675
We have ten minutes yet.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.596
Oh, Frank. Stop giving out
like an old lady, will you?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.550
I just want everyone
to go home happy from this too.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.852
Exactly. Do you hear that, Frank?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.678
Fucking hate this shit.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.349
You're take no notice of him.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.233
The baggage handler's lost his charm
at the airport, apparently.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.407
Look at this fucking <i>mulignan.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:44.078
Man, her asshole brother's got his feet
so far under the fucking table.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.742
You know what you should do?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.327
Should just tell him to leave.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.535
I can't, man. It's all part of the deal.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.788
Man, I hate house guests.

02:54.216 --> 02:58.176
Yesterday he put my shoes
out on the porch and polished them.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.338
I mean, what the fuck does that even mean?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.306
Oh, Jesus. You got any headache pills?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.557
Nah, I got smack.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.148
Talk about a fucking sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.311
Here you go.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.190
What your old lady say?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.118
I ain't been home yet.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.949
Oh, right.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.747
- She's pregnant.
- Aw, shit. Again?

03:29.418 --> 03:32.161
Considering how much you hate her,
you sure seem to fuck her a lot.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.589
Where are we going?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.472
So what's the deal with you and Frank?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.559
It's Frank's job to make sure
that no one gets in my way.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.635
And it's my job

03:49.730 --> 03:52.438
to make sure that Frank
doesn't get in his own way.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.245
Hey, Saint Francis.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.617
- What's going on?
- Get over here.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.044
- Hey!
- Where the fuck have you been?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.462
My sister's worried sick about you.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.415
Don't worry about it. When she's pregnant,
she's sick all the time.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.791
Jeez.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.382
- What happened to your eye?
- Huh?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.466
Listen, son, don't you show me up.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.141
Trying to help you here,

04:29.227 --> 04:32.186
give you an opportunity, bring you in.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.729
Is that why you polished my shoes?

04:34.775 --> 04:35.765
What?

04:37.068 --> 04:38.434
I got work gloves.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.527
Come here, Justine.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.151
You're not FBI, are you?

04:45.368 --> 04:48.156
- I'm I.I.F.M.
- What?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.912
In it for myself.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.286
- All right?
- Fuck!

04:53.376 --> 04:55.743
- Fucking sort it out.
- Jesus, Frank.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.504
My fucking balls, man!

04:59.883 --> 05:01.795
Get over here. Straighten up.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.093
You look like the fucking
Hunchback of Notre Dame.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.171
Fuck! My beautiful balls.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.217
Now, introduce yourself to the lady.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.298
Sure.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.680
- Stevo.
- Justine.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.137
Justine. <i>Enchanté.</i>

05:14.231 --> 05:16.063
Charlie's missing an angel tonight, huh?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.311
Oh, my God, beautiful.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.313
Great.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.395
So, Stevo, where did you get the vehicle?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.986
Oh, the vehicle? That's cool.
No, I did exactly what I was told.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.489
Yeah? That's a first, eh?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.410
Hey, Justine, I need some of that brown stuff

05:30.497 --> 05:32.534
you girls like to trowel all over your face.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.081
What do you mean? Like powder?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.453
Yeah, yeah.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.041
I feel a little conspicuous
with the black eye.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.713
- Oh.
- Yeah, Stevo, I'll do it for you.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.126
- I'll help you out here. Now, how's that?
- Hey, careful.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.337
- There we go.
- Careful, Chris. It's bruised.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.467
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.890
I'll fucking do it.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.808
So where's our guy, then?

05:52.936 --> 05:57.021
- We didn't come 3,000 miles for the view.
- Here he is. I'll handle it.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.024
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, sweetheart.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.730
Christopher?

06:06.575 --> 06:07.986
So what do you think?

06:08.159 --> 06:09.821
Sure, we'll give him his day in court.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.528
I don't like his jumper.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.365
A thousand apologies.
Hate it when people are tardy.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.707
This is Ord.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.001
It's good to meet you boys.
Thanks for coming out.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.750
Maybe later.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.338
You didn't masturbate before you got here,

06:27.429 --> 06:28.510
- did you.
- You what?

06:28.597 --> 06:30.509
Told you, I don't wanna work with anybody
who's carrying a loaded weapon.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.179
So if you need time,
go find yourself a dark corner.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.393
I'm just saying relax. It's all good.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.683
If you wouldn't mind, as we agreed upon...

06:43.194 --> 06:44.981
- I'll check for wires.
- I've got a gun.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.779
Good. Well, soon you guys
will have even more.

06:53.705 --> 06:54.866
Come on, big guy.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.288
You know, where I'm from, boy,
we'd be halfway up the aisle by now.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.336
Would you hold your makeup there for me?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.504
Thank you.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.921
- All right there, Smokey.
- You smell good.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.549
Thank you. It's your mother.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.633
Okay, no wires. If no one's listening in,

07:14.851 --> 07:16.012
I guess we're all friends.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.760
The, uh...

07:17.979 --> 07:21.013
The fag and the retard are an interesting
choice of muscle to bring to the party.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.143
- Just right there.
- Ow!

07:22.233 --> 07:23.644
You ain't got them blended.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.856
You know what? Fuck the small talk.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.483
Let's buy some guns, eh?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.277
All right. Step into my office.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.006
What the fuck are you doing?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.095
I'm leaving a trail of breadcrumbs.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.222
So, what did Justine tell you
about these people?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.637
Why don't we hear it from you, fella?

08:02.357 --> 08:04.269
Okay, I appreciate that you're a serious guy,

08:04.359 --> 08:07.568
I mean, fuck Britain and all that,
but you're on a different level now.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.444
The guy who represents this merchandise,

08:09.531 --> 08:11.739
his lawn is bigger
than your whole fucking country.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.282
As big as your fucking mouth, then.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.615
Tell me, Frank, is it true you people
live in houses with mud floors?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.362
- What?
- I'm just saying, you know,

08:18.456 --> 08:20.994
my ancestors probably ate raw onions
and fucked goats, so...

08:21.084 --> 08:22.791
Nah, I doubt they were that advanced.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.118
Oh, God damn it.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.249
- Watch yourself there.
- Look at this shit.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.705
It's a real fucking palace.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.381
Hey, beggars can't be choosers, Cinderella.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.709
I wonder what kind of factory it was.

08:31.803 --> 08:35.296
Well, whatever it made, nobody wants it now.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.365
Ugh. It's cold.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.447
You think this is cold, sweetheart?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.329
You should try Holywood in February.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.160
Freeze the tits of a brass witch.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.083
It's so fucking dirty.
Who put all the lights on?

09:09.174 --> 09:12.884
Only thing a girl needs to stay warm
in Los Angeles is a flexible outlook.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.377
I'm not talking about your Hollywood.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.804
I'm talking about the real Holywood.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.382
- Holywood, County Down, Northern Ireland.
- You know we've walked like half a mile?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.557
Not your Cecil B. DeMille bullshit.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.054
You guys got a Hollywood, too?

09:22.145 --> 09:24.182
Have to carry all the fucking guns
through here, all the way over there.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.600
That's what I like about this business.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.148
It can be financially rewarding
and you can still learn something new

09:28.234 --> 09:30.772
- everyday.
- Stick with your ABCs, son.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.603
Right, introductions, yeah?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.024
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.665
Vernon, why don't you come join us?
The gang's all here.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.037
Here we go.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.502
Vernon is in the blue suit.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.669
Howdy, boys. How's the digs?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.918
- Who's the other fella?
- Martin.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.920
He was a Panther, but it didn't work out.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.260
Vernon was misdiagnosed

09:56.346 --> 09:59.054
as a child genius and he never got over it.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.473
- What is he now?
- Let me do the talking, eh, boy?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.642
An international asshole.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.429
Vern, these are the boys
from across the pond.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.144
Well, everyone's from somewhere, eh?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.186
Justine. How are you, doll?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.530
As gorgeous as ever,

10:16.741 --> 10:19.279
well, you've, uh, put on a bit of weight.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.404
- Did somebody impregnate you?
- Fuck off.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.115
- Good. There's still a chance.
- What the fuck is that accent?

10:26.209 --> 10:28.826
Uh, I think it's like, Swiss or something.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.162
- Austrian.
- Oh, right. That's it. Austrian.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.293
What do you say we check out the merch?

10:33.508 --> 10:36.091
That's why we're here, eh?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.507
She's a bit shy.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.097
So, you'll be pleased to know

10:46.563 --> 10:50.898
that I have a whole truckload
of these gorgeous dolls just outside

10:50.984 --> 10:52.816
and they're all looking for dance partners.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.651
It's not what we ordered.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.187
Eh...

10:58.700 --> 10:59.941
You're a little bit rude, eh?

11:00.034 --> 11:03.243
I was presenting the merch
and you start chirping the bird there.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.618
He says it's not what he ordered.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.868
- Fuck, really? Uh...
- Let me explain.

11:10.128 --> 11:14.088
- What, uh... What did you order?
- So, we ordered M16s.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.843
You've heard of them? Now, this is an AR70.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.549
Different weapon.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.925
It's not what I ordered.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.385
You should teach your boy some manners.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.144
Learn a thing or two from the English.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.273
Keep your shit together.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.100
Martin, stay out of this.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.480
I'm not running
a fucking pizza delivery service.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.736
You want the weapons
or you don't want the weapons?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.533
- Look...
- They're assault rifles.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.657
You said rifles.
Justine, you said rifles, doll.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.283
- They're fucking rifles. What do you want?
- Look.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.535
- This is what was available.
- You're not gonna find anything else

11:49.626 --> 11:51.743
of this quality or consistency on the market.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.121
Not in the numbers that you need
or in the time that you've got.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.623
He has a point.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.064
Where from?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.726
Stop with the questions.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.775
You're a curious fucker, eh?
We're gonna get on, you and me.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.278
- They're surplus.
- So fucking curious about the world.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.700
Fucking hell, man.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.199
Look, they're surplus.
They won't be missed, all right?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.788
All right, take her for a spin.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.536
Give us the mag.

12:32.627 --> 12:36.371
No manners again. So simple.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.922
Just load it, Martin.
Just a fucking "please."

12:41.928 --> 12:43.385
Like fuck I'm gonna load it.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.308
What are you doing in front of the client?

12:50.645 --> 12:51.635
Get your shit together.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.647
If you want something done right,
you do it yourself, eh?

12:55.733 --> 12:59.352
- Amen, brother.
- Okay.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.777
Yep.

13:03.366 --> 13:07.701
I think we got off on... a little bit
of a bad footing there, eh?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.995
I think what we need to do
is just start afresh,

13:10.081 --> 13:13.165
so I'm gonna be the gentleman
in this relationship

13:13.251 --> 13:18.292
and I'm gonna chuck in a free box of lube
'cause she likes to run wet.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.586
Whoa, whoa. Slow the roll for a minute.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.584
Public safety announcement
while the rifle's hot.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.419
I'm gonna pull my pistol out.
Nothing personal.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.055
Knock yourself out, Sparky.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.636
Okay, just try not to hit
any of the metalwork,

13:33.730 --> 13:36.848
'cause I don't wanna get any
of those blim-burns on my new s...

13:39.110 --> 13:40.191
- ...suit.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.772
Sorry, what was that?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.355
This is from Savile Row...

13:49.996 --> 13:51.737
I don't know about you guys,
but I for one think

13:51.831 --> 13:53.288
Vern's merchandise is a real gas.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.287
My guess is you're whatever
you're paid to be, pal.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.035
Do you see what you did here?

14:19.650 --> 14:20.731
Good.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.395
Okay.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.742
I'll overlook it this time.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.196
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

14:42.090 --> 14:46.209
So, let's open Pandora's box, eh?

14:47.762 --> 14:52.678
All right, my, uh...

14:52.767 --> 14:54.008
Associate.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.227
...associate here will do the count,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.308
see if it's all there.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.272
It's better this way. The machine don't lie.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.999
Gordon. Gordon,
are you sure that radio is on?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.414
Course it's fucking on.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.591
Good, 'cause I don't wanna miss my cue.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.465
What the fuck you gonna do?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.640
High-kick your way in there
with a fucking top hat and cane?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.522
And, plus, it's my cue, okay?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.766
Whatever.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.731
- I'm just ready, you know?
- Yeah?

15:46.821 --> 15:48.778
And I want Vern to know that.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.573
Vern doesn't give two fucks
about what you want.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.151
Vernon can't even see you, you're that small.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.326
Plus you need to wash them knuckles
or they're gonna get infected.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.124
Fuck me.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.536
You like John Denver?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.213
I must admit, I never tire of looking at it.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.427
I never tire of looking at you, doll.

16:12.513 --> 16:16.553
So what do you know?
It's all there. On the nose.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.809
- That's heart-warming.
- And you can keep the case as well.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.104
- Oh.
- Yeah, I was going to.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.271
Thanks, eh?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.849
Real nice teeth.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.810
- Looks like a fucking cock jockey.
- Yeah.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.062
You can bring the girls in.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.192
<i>On the way.</i>

16:31.616 --> 16:34.654
Okay, so, Vern's boys are gonna drive
the car in

16:34.744 --> 16:36.952
- they're gonna put the crates of guns...
- Get your fucking hands off me.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.449
Grandpa, you gotta relax.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.956
They're gonna put the guns right here.
When they are done, they're gonna leave.

16:41.042 --> 16:44.080
Then Tweedledee and Tweedledum can
load them up into your little clown car.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.247
And you're the first one I'm gonna take
down if this goes south, big lad.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.628
- That's probably a good idea, Grandpa.
- I reckon.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.421
Oops.

16:53.221 --> 16:57.807
- Oh, sorry, you're just... You're molting.
- Hmm.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.310
Bigfoot.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.487
So before we head home,
do you wanna go for dinner with me?

17:19.079 --> 17:21.617
Oh, wow. I didn't factor that in.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.954
Well, I mean, I know
we just met and all, but...

17:25.044 --> 17:28.788
it's unlikely that I'll be over here again
before too long so I thought we could maybe...

17:28.881 --> 17:30.497
...grab a bite.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.994
Wow, when you put it like that, it doesn't
sound like a very good investment.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.347
Yeah, fuck it. But you know, fuck it.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.969
- Forget I said that.
- I will.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.059
Oh... fuck it.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.290
Fuck.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.581
Come here.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.836
Where you going? What's the matter with you?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.337
Holy mother of fuck.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.258
That's the guy who attacked me last night.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.057
That's the guy. That's the guy from the bar.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.009
That's not good. That's not good.
That's very...

18:45.541 --> 18:46.657
Bernie...

18:48.836 --> 18:50.202
Boss, keys.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.916
Okay.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.463
Lekker, man.

18:54.550 --> 18:58.169
You know what this is?
It's the key, key to victory.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.924
For you and the Irish.

19:01.015 --> 19:04.634
A van full of AR70s. Fantastic.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.889
Just let it go. Let it go, mate.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.016
- We didn't wanna get in the way.
- You didn't wanna get in the way?

19:09.106 --> 19:10.313
What are you, on holidays or something?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.560
You're supposed to be helping with the van.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.483
I'm paying you 100 bucks
to help with the van.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.980
Get over there, all right?

19:15.446 --> 19:16.482
- Okay?
- Sure. Sure.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.438
- Oh, we... we thought that...
- Shh. Just do it.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.946
Sure. You can't fucking go there.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.614
I'm telling you, you're gonna be so happy
with these weapons,

19:23.704 --> 19:24.865
you're gonna come back for more.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.446
All right, Gordon,
let's get those boxes down.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.372
- You take that end.
- You're gonna be like my bird,

19:28.459 --> 19:30.200
- begging for more, eh?
- Yeah, bring them over here,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.331
- stack them up like a...
- Yeah.

19:32.755 --> 19:33.836
- Yup, you got it.
- Okay.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.835
- Come on, guys. Come, come.
- Harry, for future reference,

19:35.925 --> 19:37.666
let's not drop the automatic weapons.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.626
Swell, man. Stop fucking complaining.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.710
Let's get the job done.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.138
I've never, uh, I've never been to Ireland.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.214
You what?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.425
I said... I said,
I've never been to Ireland, eh?

19:46.560 --> 19:47.596
Oh.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.438
You should go, man.
They'd, uh, they'd love you over there.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.442
- Perfect.
- Fuck, still more, eh?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.735
All right, guys, come on.
Let's get this done.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.028
Shit, I didn't know it was this many.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.276
I think you might owe me
a bit of extra boodle, eh?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.743
One, two, three...

20:05.830 --> 20:08.197
Hey. Come here.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.782
I'm mingling. What the fuck?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.330
What about the ammo? Back of the truck.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.667
- Oh, yeah. I'm... I'm sorry.
- Watch my fucking fingers!

20:16.757 --> 20:18.965
I think that just saying no
is kind of a reflex.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.462
- Yeah. Fuck it.
- It's stupid.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.340
No, we're not giving them that, man.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.296
I told you, I only brought that along in case

20:24.390 --> 20:25.847
I had to sweeten the deal.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.142
- The Irish went for the AR70s.
- You're the man, man.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.220
We give the M16s to the Libyans, eh?

20:31.313 --> 20:32.474
Vern and learn, baby.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.895
We should probably lock it up,
just in case they see it.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.859
I think we could.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.187
We could probably both use a drink
after this.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.988
Yeah, that'd be nice. I'd like that.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.191
- Last one.
- Yeah, you're right.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.119
Okay, just don't let them see you.
Just do it subtly.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.533
- As soon as they're done packing.
- Oh, God!

20:49.623 --> 20:51.114
- What?
- Jesus!

20:51.208 --> 20:52.289
What happened?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.206
- I got a splinter.
- Let me see that.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.832
Vern and fucking learn.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.255
Been dealing with this fucking guy all day.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.128
Hold still. Let me take it out with this.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.759
- Fuck off!
- Pussy.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.553
A fucking splinter. Are you serious?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.881
Sorry, boss. Harry distracted me.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.308
- I just suddenly feel a little bit sick.
- Really? Really?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.475
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:11.562 --> 21:13.144
- Yeah, I think...
- Sympathy's in the dictionary

21:13.230 --> 21:14.971
between "shit" and "syphilis," son,
all right?

21:15.065 --> 21:17.227
Get the fuck over there.
You make me look stupid.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.318
Three birds in a nest.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.362
Do your puking when you're walking.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.064
- Go, go, go.
- All right, Frank.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.615
Can you open up the rest of them?

21:26.535 --> 21:27.742
Here it is, eh?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.412
- The rest are all like that.
- Yeah, open the rest of 'em.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.658
- You're fucking kidding.
- No.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.709
- There's three in every box.
- Good.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.415
- It's, uh, ten boxes, 30 like we agreed.
- Vern.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.000
We covered this. Transparency, remember?

21:44.470 --> 21:48.384
Okay. Okay, mate. Harry, open them all.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.885
The customer's always right.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.805
You're not very trusting, eh, Irish?

21:53.646 --> 21:55.262
I'm English, but I'm English-South African.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.938
It's different. Trust's not your thing, eh?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.562
Son of a fucking bitch!

21:59.652 --> 22:01.689
- Jesus. What the fuck?
- ...piece of shit!

22:02.029 --> 22:03.190
Step in there, man!

22:05.407 --> 22:06.898
Come here, you fucking junkie.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.234
I'll fuck you up again,
you fucking piece of shit.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.570
- Leave it, will you?
- Calm the fuck down.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.247
Blah, blah, blah,
you fucking knuckle-dragger.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.665
All right, Stevo.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.333
...just calm that little dog.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.412
FYI, your breath stinks of shit
and you got a serious case of BO.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.418
All right, you mark my words,
you filthy addict!

22:23.425 --> 22:24.541
Eat wood, you fuck!

22:24.635 --> 22:26.001
Oh, shit.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.256
- Whoa! Hold on!
- Sorry!

22:27.346 --> 22:28.507
- You fucking wanker!
- Sorry.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.590
- You little fucking cocksucker!
- Vern, Vern, Vern. Hey, hey.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.347
We got the money. The deal's done. No use.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.846
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.273
What are you fucking doing,
you fucking clown!

22:40.359 --> 22:41.645
- Prick.
- I swear to God,

22:41.735 --> 22:43.101
you're a waste of fucking skin.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.440
- Unprovoked.
- It was uncalled for.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.114
- Took me on the... on the pip. Unprovoked.
- I know, I know. Does it hurt?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.157
- You fucking bottled her...
- No, no, it doesn't hurt.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.906
- I'm from Africa, man.
- Come over here.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.612
- Africa's not for sissies.
- I understand.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.868
Fuck it, I don't even...
I don't even feel it.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.290
But it's the principle, doll.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.288
- Fuck, he really got you.
- Yeah, principle, yeah?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.586
- Oh, God.
- Oh, fuck, okay.

23:01.672 --> 23:02.788
It's all right, I got a handkerchief.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.464
- Fix you right up.
- Okay, okay.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.001
The fuck's going on? Eh?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.086
Let them deal with it. Let them deal with it.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.260
- You're fine right here with me.
- All right.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.337
All right. All right. All right.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.848
- Little bit of a newsflash.
- Please.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.551
Harry here says that Junkie Joe over there

23:16.645 --> 23:18.432
did something pretty unconscionable
last night.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.263
I'll get to the bottom of this.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.982
All right, listen, his name's Steven.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.027
There's something wrong with him, okay?
Apologies.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.445
That's a dirty name around here, all right?

23:27.531 --> 23:28.612
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.907
The suspense is killing me.
What... what did Steven do?

23:30.993 --> 23:34.577
That fucking junkie came on to my cousin
last night at the Harlequins.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.699
And when she wouldn't suck
his fucking dick, he bottled her.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.992
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

23:41.128 --> 23:43.211
I'm serious as fucking cancer.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.420
She's scarred, man,
permanently, and she's 17.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.167
Hang on, Harry. Is this true, Gordon?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.547
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.345
The place erupted like fucking Vesuvius, man.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.798
There's not a stick of furniture left
in the place, for real.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.303
If you were to walk into Harlequins
tomorrow night

23:56.393 --> 23:58.726
with his head on a fucking stick,
you'd be a hero, man.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.929
Why would you even say that?
Why would you say that?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.565
What are you doing?
You're just making it worse.

24:03.651 --> 24:07.065
Everybody, take a chill pill, okay?
Just calm the fuck down.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.734
Now, listen here.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.366
- We'd like to leave with our money...
- Uh-huh.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.038
...and I'm sure that you boys
would like to leave

24:19.124 --> 24:21.036
- with the weapons, okay?
- Uh-huh.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.162
Mmm-hmm.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.494
- This is not good for business.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.712
Well, you know, you know,
bringing AR70s to an M16 deal

24:28.801 --> 24:29.917
is not good for business.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.047
Neither is bringing a sex pest.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.472
It's under control, doll. I got this.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.012
The bird has a point. Okay?

24:39.103 --> 24:40.765
- We'd like to trust you...
- Uh-huh.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.186
...but we can't because your boy...

24:42.272 --> 24:43.433
- Okay.
- ...has been disrespectful.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.811
All right, fair enough.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.518
- Okay?
- Just give me a minute. All right, enough.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.319
- Hey?
- You all right, Chris?

24:50.406 --> 24:51.396
Get out of my...

24:51.490 --> 24:52.480
Shit.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.564
He's doing the right thing.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.485
Jesus Christ, get the fuck off me!

24:57.246 --> 24:58.578
That's the hiding of his fucking life.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.905
Why don't you fucking tickle him to death?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.365
Fucking bottled a fucking woman?

25:01.458 --> 25:02.448
- ...what?
- Is that your thing?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.709
Is that your fucking thing, Stevo, huh?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.079
I swear on my wife's life, what the...

25:07.423 --> 25:08.834
- He bottled him, doll.
- Who does that?

25:08.924 --> 25:10.005
- I would never do that.
- No, no, no.

25:10.092 --> 25:14.086
- I would never lay my hands on a woman.
- I know. I know, you never have.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.221
You gotta believe me, Frank, he's confusing
me with some other handsome fucker.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.469
- Frank, seriously.
- All right?

25:19.643 --> 25:22.101
As God is my witness,
I did not bottle that slut.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.180
- Right, you fuck!
- Frank, please!

25:25.524 --> 25:26.981
I swear to sweet Jesus.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.854
Look, he's family, Chris, all right?

25:28.944 --> 25:32.153
- So I should be the one that...
- Fuck, Frank!

25:35.409 --> 25:36.741
Fuck, Frank!

25:36.827 --> 25:40.036
I'm fucking telling you.
Do you understand me?

25:40.122 --> 25:41.988
I'm gonna fucking bury you in a grave.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.618
- Piece of shit.
- There you go.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.745
Don't kill me, Frank.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.667
They're taking care of their own, all right?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.495
No, no, they... they... they've done it.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.579
- Just...
- All right.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.289
You're fucking going out there

25:51.675 --> 25:53.337
- and you're gonna fucking apologize.
- Okay, so...

25:53.427 --> 25:56.044
Steven has been reprimanded, all right?

25:56.138 --> 26:00.098
He's gonna... he's gonna pay
for your cousin's, um, hospital bills.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.215
He's gonna write

26:01.310 --> 26:03.802
- a sincere letter of apology.
- That's great.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.889
That's great. He's paying for the bills
and a letter in... in... in his blood.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.190
- In his own fucking blood if needs be.
- In his blood.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.983
Are you kidding me, man? A fucking letter?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.151
- Can we just get back to the guns?
- A fucking letter?

26:12.237 --> 26:14.024
Maybe she doesn't read.
Maybe she wants it drawn.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.355
Like a little, remorseful pony.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.611
- She can fucking read, Ord!
- That... stop it!

26:17.701 --> 26:20.193
- Wanna do this?
- Back off. Calm down.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.825
- Fucking relax.
- Steven's gonna apologize.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.406
See? There you go.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.130
- Let him do it.
- I'm calm.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.923
Man to man.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.129
About last night...

26:43.102 --> 26:44.388
I'm real sorry.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.599
- That's great.
- There you go.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.601
That's great. There you go.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.768
I'm really sorry.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.652
I'm really sorry, guys.

26:58.492 --> 27:02.452
'Cause I came so hard in your cousin's
mouth that I think I knocked some of her

27:02.538 --> 27:04.279
- rotten fucking teeth out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:04.456 --> 27:06.698
You're gonna have to pick 'em out
of her fucking stools

27:06.792 --> 27:09.079
at the fucking hospital!

27:09.169 --> 27:11.502
- I'm gonna give him a hiding.
- Fucking cocksuckers!

27:11.588 --> 27:13.204
Shut that motherfucker up!

27:13.298 --> 27:14.789
You said he was gonna apologize.
What was that?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.920
- Alright?
- How many times have I told you?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.127
- That's clear provocation.
- Vern, you're not helping. Alright?

27:19.221 --> 27:20.803
Just cool it, Harry, okay?

27:20.889 --> 27:24.098
Just cool it down.
Just fucking drop it, Harry.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.641
Put one of them in your fucking mouth.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.218
Fuck off back to Austria!

27:27.312 --> 27:28.974
Big fucking mouth on a little lad.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.646
- Muzzle that one.
- Okay, okay! Enough.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.019
The fuck is wrong with you, Frank?
You bring a druggie, fucking...

27:33.110 --> 27:34.146
You bring a fucking...

27:34.236 --> 27:36.353
Hey! Who are you talking druggie?
You know nothing about the lad.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.312
You're only making it worse.
Now shut the fuck up.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.818
We don't need you yelling at him. Calm down.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.275
- Who gives a shit anyway?
- Hey!

27:42.369 --> 27:43.405
What the fuck are you doing
with my gun, Harry?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.236
- No, no, Harry, Harry. Harry, no!
- Suck on this.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.710
Some fucker's gonna die!

28:37.799 --> 28:39.540
Calm down!

28:39.635 --> 28:40.671
You're just winded. You're all right

28:40.761 --> 28:43.003
- I've got it under control.
- Will you control your fucking man?

28:43.096 --> 28:46.840
- I've got him.
- Come here, you fucking cocksucker!

28:48.185 --> 28:49.551
Fuck you!

28:51.855 --> 28:53.346
- Fuck.
- I've been shot!

28:55.859 --> 28:57.646
Ord! Ord!

28:58.111 --> 29:00.524
I've been shot. I've been fucking shot.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.196
- He shot me.
- I got you. Come here.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.200
- Fuck.
- He barely nicked you, Vern. You're fine.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.443
Eh?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.487
You're gonna be okay. It's mostly the suit.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.868
Is the bullet not in there, doll?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.283
It just looks like it's the shoulder pad.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.335
My fucking suit!

29:21.510 --> 29:23.126
Chris!

29:23.220 --> 29:25.382
Frank!

29:25.472 --> 29:26.929
Ord, my gun's jammed.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.685
Christ. It's usually so reliable, man.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.478
- Fuck.
- Dust got in there.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.645
Here, take it.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.113
Don't shoot! The deal's off!

29:52.124 --> 29:55.037
Just have to wait for him
to show me his little pip.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.502
Keep cool out there.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.328
I got him.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.548
Cocksucker!

30:03.135 --> 30:05.627
- He's still moving, Vern.
- Eh?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.383
You fucking bastards!

30:11.393 --> 30:12.509
Chris is hit, Frank!

30:13.312 --> 30:15.269
Fuck!

30:16.315 --> 30:18.523
Will everybody calm the fuck down!

30:19.985 --> 30:22.523
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.854
- They shot my boy.
- Oh, shit.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.447
- Stand up.
- Martin.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.821
You bring that fucking money
over here right now.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.491
- Harry, did you get shot, you idiot?
- Fuck!

30:37.377 --> 30:40.415
Stevo! Stevo, you all right?

30:40.630 --> 30:41.620
Fuckers!

30:42.049 --> 30:43.665
You okay, Stevo?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.091
Chris, you all right?

30:51.266 --> 30:54.759
Frank! Frank, let's get out of here, Frank!

30:55.395 --> 30:56.602
Shut the fuck up.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.430
- Shit.
- All right, I'm coming over.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.985
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.404
I'm... I'm hit, but I'm good.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.447
I'm not leaving a case full of boodle
out there, okay?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.069
- Of course not.
- Ord, cover me.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.196
- I'm going for the boodle.
- Wait, Vernon.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.493
You don't wanna do that. Th...

31:12.621 --> 31:13.611
Fucker.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.877
- Stop fucking shooting, man!
- You okay, Vern?

31:20.962 --> 31:23.875
One shot me, man! I'm shot...

31:23.965 --> 31:26.127
Vern, shut up!

31:26.218 --> 31:27.379
Fuck you, Chris!

31:35.143 --> 31:36.133
Fuck!

31:36.645 --> 31:38.136
Ord, what's happening?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.347
Show us your big face.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.656
Please, nobody do anything!

31:52.869 --> 31:55.612
Stay back, sweetheart.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.620
Fuck, fuck. I'm running,
I'm running. Nobody shoot!

31:59.709 --> 32:01.541
Stay down, please, Vern.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.373
It's not gonna happen, Ord.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.170
- He's really heavy.
- Come on.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.173
Load for... load for Verny. Yes!

32:11.805 --> 32:12.795
- Come on, Vern. Make your move!
- Come on, please say something?

32:12.889 --> 32:13.879
Vern, stay down.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.057
It's too late. I've been insulted.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.304
Let me get him!

32:23.358 --> 32:25.691
Oh, fuck. Holy Jesus.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.320
Here we go. God damn it!

32:29.739 --> 32:31.275
Oh! Now we're cooking!

32:32.284 --> 32:36.494
Hey, Ord, bet you thought
you were too handsome to get shot, huh?

32:36.580 --> 32:39.789
I'm just impressed
you haven't needed a nap yet, Francis.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.289
Martin, look at me. Look at me.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.712
Look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.255
You're gonna be okay. Just say something.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.052
What the fuck?

33:00.687 --> 33:02.223
Gordon, over here.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.603
Gordon, you all right?

33:06.693 --> 33:09.026
What the fuck is that now?
Who's shooting that?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.609
- Frank?
- Oi!

33:17.037 --> 33:18.949
Who the fuck is shooting at us now?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.743
- You good?
- What the fuck was that?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.328
Sounds like a fucking rifle.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.163
Move back! Move back!

33:33.220 --> 33:34.427
What the fuck?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.466
Redeem yourself and get that case.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.966
You get the fucking case, asshole.
Fuck you, man.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.676
Ah!

33:46.316 --> 33:48.774
Whatever. I forgot whose side I'm on.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.644
Oh, fuck, fuck.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.195
- Doll!
- What?

33:53.281 --> 33:54.271
Go for the case.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.857
You're a bird.
They're not gonna shoot the bird.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.694
- Just go for the case.
- Don't... you get the fucking case!

33:58.828 --> 34:01.195
Okay, let's try something.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.911
Fuck!

34:08.338 --> 34:10.170
Shit! Shit.

34:11.132 --> 34:14.795
Jesus. F...

34:20.058 --> 34:21.139
Great.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.181
Ord, get the case.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.435
Got it, Vern.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.059
Go for the case.

34:33.737 --> 34:34.774
No.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.275
No, what are you doing? Not that case!

34:36.491 --> 34:38.152
Hang in.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.659
Stop fucking shooting!

34:43.706 --> 34:45.539
Did you cheaters bring a sniper?

34:46.293 --> 34:47.373
Not with us!

34:48.460 --> 34:49.746
He's not with us.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.163
Sounds like a fucking Garand.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.543
Someone's firing a carbine behind me.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.375
Vern, your friend needs serious help.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.007
He'll have to wait.
I'm a bit preoccupied right now.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.427
Shit.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.593
- Fuck!
- All right, little wallflower.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.105
Don't be shy. Come out and play.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.523
Fuck!

35:31.671 --> 35:35.540
- Give me the fucking gun.
- Give me that fucking...

35:39.304 --> 35:41.512
- Let it go. Let it...
- Not a fucking chance.

36:06.539 --> 36:07.575
Ord!

36:08.875 --> 36:11.458
Ord! Ord!

36:11.628 --> 36:15.167
Ord, I'm taking fire!
Cover me! Cover me! I'm coming in.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.542
I'm taking fire!

36:18.009 --> 36:20.467
- Here. Here I come.
- I got your back. Move.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.007
Christ!

36:25.934 --> 36:26.924
- You all right?
- Yeah.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.010
- You still breathing?
- Yeah.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.813
Two shooters. One behind you.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.686
One at two o'clock.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.643
I'm gonna flank that fucker, eh?

36:39.823 --> 36:42.941
He's dying everyone stop it. Just stop it.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.321
- Stay with me.
- Leave him. He's done. Come on.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.744
Come on, come on. Come with me.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.788
Oh, fuck!

36:54.504 --> 36:56.541
- Shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, sure.

36:56.631 --> 37:00.341
I can't believe that I gave a shit
about your cousin. You little asshole!

37:01.886 --> 37:04.424
Fuck! You fuck!

37:05.223 --> 37:07.431
Ah! Fucking bastard!

37:13.481 --> 37:15.939
Ah, no!

38:49.994 --> 38:53.032
Frank. Over here, Frank.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.715
- Fuck.
- Chris, you all right?

39:05.176 --> 39:06.417
No.

39:09.764 --> 39:10.754
Fuck.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.096
Harry? Harry, are you okay?

39:24.821 --> 39:27.063
Go on. Go on, keep going. Get up.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.234
All right.

39:32.829 --> 39:33.865
All right.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.915
All right. All right, nice and steady.

39:46.926 --> 39:47.962
Bernie!

39:48.595 --> 39:51.303
- Just taking a fucking walk.
- What the fuck are you doing, Bernie?

39:51.639 --> 39:53.050
Aim with two hands, Vern.

39:53.683 --> 39:54.719
Fuck.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.467
- Ah!
- No fucking way!

39:56.561 --> 39:57.597
I nailed him.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.220
Nah, I'm all right, Stevo.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.431
- Great shot, Vern.
- I fucking nailed him.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.932
I'm all right.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.859
Frank, he shot Bernie in the back!

40:13.786 --> 40:15.322
Bernie, get up!

40:15.580 --> 40:17.822
Quit your fucking whining, Stevo.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.705
- You fucking knuckle-dragger.
- You fucking cocksucker.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.080
- Bernie!
- Gordon.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.164
Yeah?

40:27.258 --> 40:30.171
I'll give you my fucking Rolex,
if you go for that case right now.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.253
Your Rolex is a fake, Vern.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.135
Don't do this to me, Bernie.
What am I gonna tell your mother?

40:38.144 --> 40:42.980
I hate these fucking freelance jobs.

40:43.149 --> 40:47.018
- You're gonna make me fucking puke, Stevo.
- Shut the fuck up, man!

40:50.239 --> 40:53.107
I'm gonna fucking kill these bastards,
fucking cocksuckers.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.709
You're fucking dead, you fuck!

41:04.796 --> 41:05.786
Piece of shit!

41:05.880 --> 41:08.588
This is legit. It's worth £700, mate.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.337
I'm telling you, Vern, it's a fake.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.009
- I don't want your fucking watch.
- Fuck me!

41:23.815 --> 41:26.102
These bastards should
fucking hang their heads in shame

41:26.192 --> 41:27.478
for what they done today.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.479
I know I speak for everybody
when I express my sympathies to Steven

41:31.572 --> 41:33.529
for the loss of his special friend.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.493
Fuck Steven, man. He started the whole thing.

41:38.705 --> 41:39.695
He shot the boy.

41:39.789 --> 41:40.905
I'm not dead.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.449
I'm just regrouping.

41:44.544 --> 41:47.287
Fucking hang their head in shame
for what they done today.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.914
That's right, you're a fucking angel, man.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.253
You're a fucking angel sent from heaven,

41:52.343 --> 41:54.335
that's what you are.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.972
Anyway,
I'm sure Bernie's off to a better place.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.883
Maybe he'll even make
something of himself down there.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.681
I'm fucking grieving here!

42:04.897 --> 42:06.229
Fucking grieving.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.432
I'm coming for you, man.

42:09.152 --> 42:10.768
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.854
You fucking try it, you cocksucker!

42:13.281 --> 42:15.443
- Cover me. I need to come over.
- Fine, Vernon.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.571
- We need to strategize.
- Okay.

42:19.412 --> 42:22.325
You still collecting a pension, Frank?

42:22.415 --> 42:23.531
Fuck off.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.329
All right,
I'll mark you as present on the roster.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.372
Justine?

42:28.838 --> 42:31.421
Here!

42:32.091 --> 42:34.208
Good girl. I like your style.

42:36.637 --> 42:39.550
This goddamn dust,
it's bringing on my allergies.

42:40.016 --> 42:41.552
Shut the fuck up, Gordon.

42:42.477 --> 42:43.638
Fuck you, Harry.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.685
You'll always be in my thoughts, Bernie.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.310
They'll never take away the good times.

42:50.818 --> 42:54.653
I think something actually just...
hit my head. I'm just...

42:55.615 --> 42:56.822
Just a little thing.

42:57.617 --> 42:58.653
A scratch.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.735
It was nothing.

43:11.047 --> 43:12.504
Chrissy,

43:13.007 --> 43:14.873
do you remember that time Frank got...

43:16.302 --> 43:19.090
got so drunk he stripped down to his Y-fronts

43:19.430 --> 43:22.423
at Kieran's wake
and cried over the coffin like a baby?

43:22.517 --> 43:24.133
Oh, you fucking asshole.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.301
No comment!

43:26.521 --> 43:29.104
That was the last time he had a drink.
Right, Frank?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.854
Frank, you're an alcoholic?

43:34.529 --> 43:35.565
Recovering.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.654
Somebody better tell me

43:38.032 --> 43:40.069
who invited these gatecrashers?

43:40.368 --> 43:42.610
Yeah, who were those gatecrashers, Vern?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.411
Mmm.

43:51.921 --> 43:54.709
Steve. Stevo.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.342
Hey!

43:59.846 --> 44:00.836
How many?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.596
Oh, come on, for fuck's sake.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.636
Tall one.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.061
How many fuckers are over there? Oi.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.277
What?

44:25.955 --> 44:27.787
- Never mind.
- Steve.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.495
You, fucking chocolate teapot.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.538
Huh?

44:32.712 --> 44:33.998
How many?

44:35.298 --> 44:36.505
Fuck you, Frank.

44:37.258 --> 44:40.547
Yeah, lucky thing your friend Vern's
too cheap to pay for good shooters.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.969
They couldn't be with Vernon.

44:44.432 --> 44:49.351
Must have been someone that got wind of the
deal and then decided to chance it.

44:49.437 --> 44:52.590
Fucking Stevo and his big fucking mouth.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.066
What the fuck is Chris doing with Justine?

45:04.493 --> 45:06.576
She's tending... She's tending to his wounds.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.245
- Vern, go shoot him.
- Has he kidnapped her?

45:09.957 --> 45:11.573
Stop. I don't wanna die.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.501
You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.252
I'm just gonna check on Frank.

45:16.881 --> 45:17.962
What you're gonna do...

45:18.799 --> 45:20.165
When you get out of here,

45:20.551 --> 45:24.044
you find the first restaurant,
and I'll meet you there.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.342
All right?

45:33.397 --> 45:34.433
All right.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.729
They're playing us, okay?
She's on their side.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.023
And these urks are with them.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.778
Yeah, but, Vern, one of them shot her.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.990
Or did we shoot her?

45:54.919 --> 45:56.205
Fuck.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.843
You've got two choices.

46:05.096 --> 46:09.261
One, you distract them
with your badinage and I leave.

46:10.059 --> 46:11.140
My what?

46:11.435 --> 46:12.767
Or two,

46:13.396 --> 46:16.230
you kill all of these motherfuckers
and I leave.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.818
Now's a good time to bring up our contract.

46:22.196 --> 46:26.615
For the amount of money we agreed on, there
were no extenuating circumstances like this.

46:29.829 --> 46:31.240
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:31.664 --> 46:33.872
How can you talk about money
at a time like this?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.167
Get me an ambulance!

46:47.013 --> 46:48.299
I know that voice.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.881
We can't leave here empty-handed.

46:52.727 --> 46:55.265
Where the fuck is Leary
when you need him, eh?

46:56.397 --> 46:57.854
Howard Mathison?

46:59.108 --> 47:03.853
Ord, if I'd known you was in on this,
I wouldn't have taken the job.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.814
That geriatric reprobate's
supposed to be retired.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.148
What?

47:09.785 --> 47:11.617
- What are you doing?
- I need help!

47:11.704 --> 47:13.161
- Ord.
- You've no idea.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.408
Protecting our asses, Vern.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.156
Wooden boxes don't stop bullets.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.583
The college fees, the medical bills.

47:19.628 --> 47:20.960
Plus Rita left me.

47:22.131 --> 47:25.215
I hooked up with this Asian chick.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.841
She cleaned me out.

47:27.553 --> 47:31.388
Howard, I'm gonna stack
the bodies of your 11 children

47:31.474 --> 47:34.012
on top of each other
and burn them on your lawn

47:34.101 --> 47:36.263
if you don't tell me who hired you right now!

47:37.355 --> 47:38.687
Tell us, Howard!

47:39.106 --> 47:41.348
That's good. That's good.
That's what I'm paying you for.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.729
Don't listen to him.
He's not the boss of you.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.230
Fuck you, you junkie!

47:45.654 --> 47:47.270
The junkie's still fucking alive?

47:48.949 --> 47:50.360
I'm no rat.

47:52.495 --> 47:54.452
Gonna die anyway.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.994
Seeing as it's you, Ord...

48:01.837 --> 48:04.500
I'll tell you.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.416
It was...

48:21.148 --> 48:22.730
My guys.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.356
Fucking made it.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.778
Howard's done talking.

48:29.198 --> 48:30.860
Ord, I'm feeling light-headed.

48:31.534 --> 48:33.321
I think I'm losing too much blood.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.820
Relax. It didn't even hit an artery.
You're fine.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.496
You got at least an hour and a half.

48:39.458 --> 48:40.539
Eh?

48:41.377 --> 48:43.243
It's the golden hour and a half. It's a rule.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.914
How long's... How long's it been?

48:49.135 --> 48:50.251
Ord!

48:52.012 --> 48:53.002
What?

48:53.722 --> 48:55.338
We're here for the guns, right?

48:55.724 --> 48:56.931
You're here for the money.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.766
Let Justine get out.

49:02.982 --> 49:03.972
What are you doing?

49:04.984 --> 49:06.191
Right, she makes contact

49:07.027 --> 49:10.236
with our respective people,
they come find us.

49:10.531 --> 49:11.863
Everyone's happy.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.115
- Yeah.
- No.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.158
- She can leave.
- What are you doing?

49:16.245 --> 49:17.531
Good.

49:17.913 --> 49:19.700
Justine, you're good to go.

49:19.790 --> 49:20.826
Thank you.

49:21.125 --> 49:22.241
There you go.

49:22.501 --> 49:23.537
All right.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.997
I'll do it if Vernon promises
not to shoot me in the back.

49:29.508 --> 49:33.001
She's making it personal now.

49:33.387 --> 49:34.503
Promise her.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.141
Cross my heart, doll.

49:42.813 --> 49:43.803
Okay.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.557
Ord, I shot that guy.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.937
That's the death penalty in Massachusetts.

49:49.612 --> 49:52.355
Yeah. I vote we barbeque
this whole fucking place.

49:52.448 --> 49:55.361
There's more blood on the floor here
than a sausage factory, man.

49:55.910 --> 49:58.152
You think this is a fucking senate committee?

49:58.245 --> 49:59.861
- You don't get a vote.
- Fuck you.

49:59.955 --> 50:01.036
Shut up.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.698
She's a snake in the grass.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.531
- She was tending to him.
- Okay, Vern, listen.

50:06.629 --> 50:08.086
- Vern, shh.
- She was tending... She's on their side.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.755
Look at that. I told you, she's escaping.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.542
Wake up and smell the Ricoffy, Ord.

50:19.642 --> 50:20.883
There's a phone in this building.

50:29.818 --> 50:31.650
If there's a phone, I can call the boys.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.737
You're a fucking dead man, Vernon!

50:44.542 --> 50:46.283
She's firing back.
I told you, she's on their side.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.331
'Cause you shot at her, Vern.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.879
A pushy woman isn't sexy, Justine.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.581
Chrissy thinks they are.

50:55.261 --> 50:56.968
You come back here, Justine.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.178
# <i>Justine and Chrissy</i>

50:59.390 --> 51:01.222
<i># Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...</i>

51:01.308 --> 51:04.551
Frank, I'll shoot him in the head.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.181
- Steven, Steven.
- I'll shoot him in the fucking head.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.013
- I will shoot him in the fucking head.
- You keep this up,

51:08.399 --> 51:10.686
I'll wash my fucking hands of you. All right?

51:10.776 --> 51:12.733
I know what you're up to, Justine.

51:12.945 --> 51:15.312
You fucking maniac. I'll shoot you myself.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.647
- Nail her, Gordon.
- Okay, boss.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.026
There's a promotion in it for you, boy.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.403
You fucking turncoat.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.906
You don't even get an opinion.
You fucking started this whole thing.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.077
It's your fucking fault.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.868
Ord, stop it, man.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.663
What you doing, man? Stop it, Ord!

51:29.003 --> 51:30.244
You think you're a big man.
Look at you, you fucker.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.623
Stop.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.125
- Stop that!
- Get off of me!

51:33.299 --> 51:34.380
Come on!

51:38.971 --> 51:39.961
Boys.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.923
Boys, knock it off, man.

51:43.726 --> 51:44.842
- Ow!
- Man, watch the foot, will you?

51:46.061 --> 51:47.347
Hey, what the fuck?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.851
Hey, help me out here.
Get this fucker loaded up.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.647
- Stop.
- ...you're a fucking kid.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.107
You fucking baby.

51:53.277 --> 51:55.610
- Stevo, here, take the radio.
- What the fuck you gonna do?

51:56.363 --> 51:58.776
- Give me that sand, give me cover.
- Make sure she gets out of here.

51:58.866 --> 52:01.324
Do you hear me? Make sure she gets out.

52:01.910 --> 52:03.276
- Ord, stop it.
- Stop it.

52:07.541 --> 52:11.080
Ord, where you going? Ord, where you going?

52:11.420 --> 52:12.410
Hey.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.418
Ord, come back here!

52:16.675 --> 52:19.418
- Come back here right now!
- Oh, what is his fucking problem, man!

52:33.025 --> 52:34.857
You sneaky fucker.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.748
Fuck!

53:11.939 --> 53:14.352
Get out of here, woman, for Christ's sake.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.024
I'm going!

53:34.503 --> 53:35.584
Fuck!

53:40.384 --> 53:41.670
Oh, fuck!

53:42.761 --> 53:45.299
I just shot Ord.
He's gonna fucking kill me, man.

53:51.186 --> 53:53.143
You smell of perfume.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.022
It's beard oil.

53:57.443 --> 54:00.106
- Fuck. Do it, Frank.
- I can't get a clear shot at him.

54:00.195 --> 54:02.562
Go, Ord! Nail him, boykie!

54:02.656 --> 54:03.646
Oh, fuck!

54:58.045 --> 54:59.832
What are you doing, Vern?

55:01.965 --> 55:03.251
Huh?

55:03.342 --> 55:05.675
You making a new suit over there?

55:09.640 --> 55:11.131
Here, Chrissy, come on.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.763
Oh, fuck.

55:25.572 --> 55:28.485
Ah! My fucking leg,
you've got my leg, you cunt!

55:36.750 --> 55:40.209
Did you see that? That was me.

55:41.630 --> 55:42.791
Fucking hell.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.067
Yeah, I didn't see that, Steven.

55:45.551 --> 55:46.587
You know why?

55:47.010 --> 55:48.717
'Cause it fucking happened to me.

55:48.804 --> 55:49.840
Huh?

55:49.930 --> 55:52.092
Oh, yeah. That was fucking awesome.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.923
You're a fucking hero.

55:54.601 --> 55:57.514
Does anyone care
what happened to me by any chance?

55:57.813 --> 56:00.681
Save it for your fucking autobiography.

56:02.901 --> 56:04.733
- Hey, Vern.
- What?

56:05.112 --> 56:07.069
I like your cardboard armor.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.401
It's protection from infection.

56:11.535 --> 56:12.525
Frank.

56:13.745 --> 56:14.781
What?

56:15.163 --> 56:17.826
Frank, one of us needs to get
to this fucking phone.

56:26.425 --> 56:27.506
I'll do it.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.887
Rhodesian Special Forces trick.

56:34.016 --> 56:35.507
No shit.

56:35.601 --> 56:39.185
You know, I'm more likely to die
from the germs

56:39.354 --> 56:41.767
infecting the wound than any bullets.

56:42.357 --> 56:43.848
Well, I guess you're covered.

56:44.318 --> 56:46.105
You'll be fine, though. You've got about...

56:47.362 --> 56:48.728
You've got about an hour 20

56:49.156 --> 56:52.365
before you're in trouble with that wound
and I've got to get to that phone.

56:52.784 --> 56:56.243
Hey, Vern, is everybody like you
where you come from?

56:57.539 --> 56:59.747
Vern is a rare and mysterious jewel.

57:00.959 --> 57:03.326
Feast your eyes, boykie.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.002
Watch and Vern,

57:05.547 --> 57:08.005
then go back to your miserable life.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.258
All right, I'll see you later, Vern.

57:23.065 --> 57:25.102
Where you running off to, Frank?

57:26.109 --> 57:27.600
We're just getting started.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.868
- Frank!
- Ord, give us a hand, man.

57:40.540 --> 57:41.872
Oh, fuck!

58:00.018 --> 58:01.054
God!

58:04.523 --> 58:07.231
Oh, fuck. Shit. It's me.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.319
Justine, stay still!

58:19.579 --> 58:21.992
Fuck. What the fuck?

59:02.831 --> 59:04.868
- Martin.
- The bullets.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.876
Ah! Fuck. Fuck.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.504
Go fucking get them.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.724
God damn it!

59:33.487 --> 59:36.400
Harry, move! Move.

59:37.074 --> 59:38.064
Fuck!

59:43.371 --> 59:44.703
Fuck!

59:45.457 --> 59:48.700
Oh, fuck! Ah! Jesus.

59:50.045 --> 59:51.957
Stop shooting, you assholes.

59:57.094 --> 01:00:01.464
Oh, fuck.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.685
So, Ord,
are you gonna go pat down Martin's body?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.777
Oh, you fucker.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:33.206
Ten grand.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.293
Fuck. Why not 20?

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:43.589
We'll leave an IOU for Vern.
I'm sure he'll understand.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:50.809
I see him. I see Frank. I see Frank.
He's going for the phone! He's winning!

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:56.517
- Fuck.
- Do you think Frank's okay?

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:00.150
- What do you care, huh?
- I clipped his wing.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.072
All right, I'm gonna go out there.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:19.792
I gotta get the keys so I can open
the van and get the bullets, Martin.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.126
Steven?

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.622
Ste... Fuck.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:29.009
Fucking brilliant. North face of the Eiger.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.486
So that's what a fucking brain looks like.

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.613
Whoa! Fuck!

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.575
Man, I thought you were fucking dead.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:53.082
Ord! Ord! Hey, get the fuck off of me.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.244
You got shot in the head, Martin.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.208
Where the fuck am I?

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.211
Hey, hey. Party Marty.

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:04.426
I know you.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.805
- Come on, man.
- Get the fuck out of there.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.095
I just want my money.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.644
It's okay. I'm not shooting. It's cool.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.270
Stop running!

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.739
Jesus!

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.078
Ord? Yo.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.326
Where's the fucking money?

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:35.492
Safe, man.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:36.876
I put it in the Fireman's Fund.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.208
Justine?

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:43.795
Justine!

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.885
Don't leave me in the dark, baby.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.051
Think she made it?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.345
Yeah, course she did.

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:57.392
Fuck!

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.187
Fuck!

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.524
Fucking stop!

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.279
Howard, you up there?

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:13.112
Yo, come down, man. It's cool.
I know you fucked it all up.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.622
What's your gun doing here, man?

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.877
Howard!

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.338
I'm not your boy, Vern!

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.629
Hey, Howard.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.928
What are you doing
all the way over there, man?

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:40.348
It was a simple fucking plan, man.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.891
You fucked it up.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.736
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.081
Get the fuck...

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.802
Give me a second. I'm just gonna reload.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.680
Give me my fucking money!

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:28.479
Fuck!

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.782
- Don't do it, man.
- No?

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.665
- You know where the money is?
- It's right there.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.498
Okay, look, it's all good.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.277
That's beautiful.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.784
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.345
All right, everybody hold your fire

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:42.853
until I find out if this motherfucker
is dead this time.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.900
Poke him in the eye. See if he flinches.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.451
Justine!

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.347
You're scared.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.597
I can feel it.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.812
Look, I just want you to know,

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.478
before I do this for Vern,

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.815
I've been right where you are now.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.574
<i>I've scrabbled around in some lousy job,</i>

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.746
<i>I've made personal sacrifices,</i>

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.204
only to have some fucking parasite

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.202
<i>turn up at the last minute</i>

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.621
and take all the credit.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:54.588
That's why I appreciate the arts, you know?

01:06:57.388 --> 01:06:59.004
<i>If it wasn't for them,</i>

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:02.808
then all we're doing... is just this.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.857
Ow! Fuck! Fucking shot me!

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.785
You seem like a nice girl.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.917
We can't all be nice girls.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.120
God! No!

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.751
Ow! Fuck.

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:57.564
Fuck! You fucking shot me again!

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.544
You dropped this.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.970
Oh, oh...

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:28.719
Oh, fuck.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.992
Fuck.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.372
<i>Congratulations.</i>

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.799
<i>...Americans to receive a free</i>
<i>lifetime supply</i>

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.631
<i>of Boardman's premier ground meat.</i>

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.058
<i>All you have to do to claim your prize...</i>

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:27.486
- Stevo, you all right?
- Yeah.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.912
Yeah? I gotta go and check on Frank.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.410
Keep an eye out, all right?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.242
You stay here. You stay awake.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.826
I tell you what,

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.836
we'll have a fucking cigarette.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:41.676
Chrissy and Stevo have a fucking cigarette.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:44.881
Mmm.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.944
Remember, Stevo, stay awake for me, yeah?

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:04.527
'Cause if you go to sleep, you're dead.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:07.989
- Yeah?
- Okay.

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:09.282
Good man.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.517
What the fuck?

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.476
Oh, men.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:15.403
Fuck!

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.334
Wait.

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:34.882
I don't think so.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:40.679
Frank.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.820
Oh, Frank.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:59.664
I see you, you fucking yeti.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.175
Hello? Hello, Sandy.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:17.466
Listen to me. Where's Leary? He didn't show.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.385
Ooh, fuck!

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:21.561
It's fucking Chris, Sandy.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.316
He's meant to be here.
I'm fucking here. Where's Leary?

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.779
...look for fucking Brendan.
Tell him I'm sorry.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.191
Sandy?

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:36.610
Fuck!

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:49.923
Frank.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.339
Chris.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.487
Over here, Leary!

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:19.657
Leary, up here, boy!

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.071
Ah!

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.827
You fucking cunt!

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.538
Ow!

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.089
Leary!

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.856
Oh.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:50.150
Holy shit!

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.117
Come on there, big man.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.782
Fuck off, you freak of nature.

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.505
Stay the fuck down!

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.085
Oh, fuck.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:18.758
Oh, fuck.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:22.970
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:38.527
I'll get you home, Frank.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.526
Don't worry, I'll get you home.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:46.865
I'm sorry, pal.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.917
Where do you think you're going,
little Harry?

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.999
I'm going to the hospital.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.790
To see my cousin.

01:15:58.345 --> 01:15:59.711
Stop moving.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:03.135
If you go any farther with that money,
I'll shoot you in the head.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.716
Fuck you, Ord.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.702
I'm getting away, Ord.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.126
See you 'round!

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:38.045
Don't wait up for me, Ord.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.136
Damn.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.060
You gotta smoke less dope

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.229
if you wanna hit something
once in a while, Ord.

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:53.557
Fuck you, trash.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.608
Start, you piece of junk.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.654
Ah.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:05.076
Let's go.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:06.615
Here we go.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:09.031
Come on, Ord.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.256
That you, Harry?

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.050
<i>Is that John Denver, Harry?</i>

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.509
<i>Four-eyed fucking faggot.</i>

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.507
- What the fuck?
<i>- I'm still here.</i>

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.763
I'll be the last man standing.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.640
Ha!

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.120
Get the fuck out of here, you fucking zombie!

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:00.582
Nice ride!

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:30.370
Ah, get the fuck out of here!

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:28.898
I'd say we got about 15 minutes
before the fuzz shows up.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:36.496
Yeah? What do you wanna do?

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:44.830
Get a beer.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:51.636
Sure. Why the fuck not?

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.590
Who's buying?

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.306
Technically, you are.

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:01.183
Yeah?

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.436
Hey, how about we go Dutch, eh?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.991
Oh...

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:25.041
Oh, fuck!

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.961
- Get your fucking hands off.
- Hey, hey, come on, come on.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.762
- Fuck off.
- Proud bastard.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.677
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:40.139
You could catch your death of cold in here.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:44.476
Boy, they really did a number on you,
didn't they?

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:47.400
Do you want me to hold that?

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.436
You know, I think I can manage.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.689
Why don't you sit down right there?

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:54.490
Go grab a seat.

01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:58.448
Fuck...

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.837
Oh, fuck. I think they shot Harry in the ass.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:21.143
All right, I got a John Denver story for you.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.933
So...

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:27.849
Huh?

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:16.607
You made it. Good for you.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:17.857
Yeah.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.079
I'm sorry, you got in the way.

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:26.032
Well...

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:29.164
Hey, who were the shooters?

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:31.913
Oh, I'm not good with names.

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:35.959
- Martin hired them.
- Oh.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:41.882
So, about dinner... can I take a rain check?

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.603
Hey, you take what you want, girl.

01:23:48.305 --> 01:23:54.826
