PAULIE: (Narrating)
When I was 9 years old,
I elected to forgo friendships

01:07.201 --> 01:09.436
and instead dedicate my life to
becoming one

01:09.469 --> 01:12.572
of the greatest thinkers
of the 21st century,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.342
a scientist worthy
of acceptance

01:14.374 --> 01:18.179
to the Shikenjanski Lab
for Artificial Intelligence.

01:20.047 --> 01:23.117
Even as a child, I knew that
if I worked tirelessly,

01:23.150 --> 01:24.651
I was capable
of developing the type

01:24.684 --> 01:27.454
of ground-breaking technology
you are about to see today.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.227
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a Shikenjanski Bot

01:33.261 --> 01:35.795
named after
Professor Chuck Shikenjanski.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.433
I'll just show you.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.306
Most AI is set up to follow
simple commands.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.942
Janski, spin around.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.481
But my technology only obeys
commands that are

01:54.514 --> 01:56.183
in its best interest.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.519
Janski, drive forward 3 feet.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.422
(beeps)

02:02.455 --> 02:04.424
It only drove like a foot

02:04.457 --> 02:05.725
Because jumping off the desk
wouldn't be

02:05.759 --> 02:07.194
in the bot's best interest.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.096
Did I say you could come
in here?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.933
What if jumping off the desk
was really fun?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.969
Wouldn't that be
in the bot's best interest?

02:15.002 --> 02:17.405
This is why I'm going to college
a year early.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.672
Nobody here understands
what it takes

02:18.705 --> 02:20.141
to become an important person.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.709
You don't know how to be
a person, period.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.812
Your mom has your letter,
by the way.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.846
What letter?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.714
From Professor Shiken-whatever.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.216
What?

02:34.922 --> 02:35.856
It feels thick.

CATHY: (On phone)
I did.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.482
They were even less helpful
than you.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.816
No,
I didn't mean it like that.

03:35.850 --> 03:37.018
Don't hang up, please.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.752
I need to connect

you took your uncle's van

without asking.

08:29.877 --> 08:30.844
He never drives it.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.313
He just leaves it
in a parking lot

08:32.346 --> 08:33.681

08:33.714 --> 08:35.215
Don't tell me.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.650
Tell him.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.321

to fly here from California

08:40.354 --> 08:42.155

11:28.121 --> 11:29.089
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
Close.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.892
The one in town
is a tiger muskie.

11:30.925 --> 11:31.893
Did you catch this one?

11:31.926 --> 11:34.294

11:35.095 --> 11:36.697

11:36.730 --> 11:37.866
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
It's true.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.566
We were fishing a few bays away,

11:39.600 --> 11:41.068
which is wild in itself,

11:41.101 --> 11:43.303
because we're not even
on a muskie lake,

11:43.337 --> 11:45.840
and Avery had
this crummy second-hand rod.

11:45.874 --> 11:48.108
Oh, uh, Avery, Polly.
Polly, Avery.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.811

11:49.844 --> 11:52.312
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
Oh, great.

11:52.346 --> 11:55.716
So anyway,
when that fish hit Avery's line,

11:55.749 --> 11:58.652
I had no idea how big it was,
because she wouldn't hand me

11:58.685 --> 12:00.320
the rod.

12:00.354 --> 12:02.656
She wanted to do
the whole thing herself.

12:02.689 --> 12:03.825
8 years old.

12:03.858 --> 12:06.393
You must have fought that thing
for what, 20 minutes?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.761
35.

12:07.794 --> 12:11.298
Well, long enough, that one
of her hands started bleeding.

12:21.642 --> 12:24.111
It's not every day my dad
brings home a hungry criminal

12:24.144 --> 12:25.546
for dinner.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.613
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
We just had a little
miscommunication

12:26.647 --> 12:28.482
down at the station.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.350
I told Paulie he could crash up
in the loft

12:30.384 --> 12:32.219
and uh, pick up his van
in the morning

12:32.252 --> 12:33.922
and head on back to California.

12:33.955 --> 12:35.255
AVERY:
No more manhunt?

12:35.289 --> 12:36.590
It's not a manhunt.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.158
I just need to connect
with a colleague

12:38.191 --> 12:39.928
who lives off the grid.

12:39.961 --> 12:41.863
You already work
with the professor?

12:41.896 --> 12:43.697
Not yet.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.700
Paulie's graduating
from high school a year early.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.369
Yeah, Avery's going to Duluth
in the fall.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.471
Why don't you just wait
till you're on campus

12:51.505 --> 12:53.507
to introduce yourself
to the professor?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.242
How much do you know
about the progress

12:55.275 --> 12:57.477
of deep learning algorithms
and humanoid robots?

12:57.511 --> 12:59.513
As much as you know about
table manners.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.148
Hey.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.683
AVERY:
Sorry.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.056
So you got into school
a year early.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.857
I would have,
if the admissions people

13:09.891 --> 13:12.092
knew anything about
artificial intelligence.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.427
You got rejected?

13:14.728 --> 13:16.630
I could reposition
European space satellites

13:16.663 --> 13:18.298
if I wanted to.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.805
You know,
Avery actually knows quite a bit

13:23.838 --> 13:25.439
about technology herself.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.306
Dad.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.141
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
What? You do.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.110
She makes videos
on the internet.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.678
Videos?

13:31.712 --> 13:32.646
Yeah.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.882
Fishing videos,
ton of people watch 'em.

13:34.916 --> 13:35.883
PAULIE:
Why?

13:35.917 --> 13:36.951
Dad, put it away.

13:36.985 --> 13:37.751
I'll just show him one.

13:37.784 --> 13:38.552
(sighs)

13:38.585 --> 13:39.720
Whatever.

13:41.923 --> 13:43.557
Look at this.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.593
Okay, guys, nearly got him.

13:46.627 --> 13:48.462
I'm pretty sure it's a Walleye.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.230
Notice how I didn't just start
pumping my rod

13:50.263 --> 13:51.698
when I felt him strike.

13:51.732 --> 13:54.234
Unlike northerns,
Walleye don't slash at bait,

13:54.267 --> 13:55.669
they inhale it.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.405
So if you pull back too quick,
you could pull the bait

13:58.438 --> 14:01.009
clean out of the fish's mouth.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.645
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
She really is a great angler.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.015
I mean,
that video has like 5,000 views.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.321
She's not usually rude
like that.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.025
Her boyfriend just broke up
with her, and--

14:17.058 --> 14:18.558
and he's a total burnout,

14:18.592 --> 14:19.827
but they spent a lot
of time together.

14:21.762 --> 14:26.400
She doesn't have a lot
of close friends, you know?

14:27.401 --> 14:31.338
She's more like independent,
self-sufficient.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.108
And scary.

14:34.142 --> 14:35.810
Hmm?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.889
AVERY:
What's happening on Spider Lake?

14:50.124 --> 14:51.591
Nothing.

14:53.094 --> 14:54.896
You can't just spy on people.

14:54.929 --> 14:56.496
'Cause that's your thing.

14:59.967 --> 15:00.968
What do you want?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.940
Why would an artificial
intelligence professor hide out

15:05.973 --> 15:07.441
in northern Minnesota?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.276
He doesn't wanna be found.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.677
AVERY:
How did you find him?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.547
I built an algorithm to bypass
the firewalls

15:13.580 --> 15:14.882
in the school's
human resource department,

15:14.916 --> 15:16.984
so another bot could process
the information related

15:17.018 --> 15:18.920
to Professor Shikenjanski's
whereabouts.

15:18.953 --> 15:20.353
That can't be legal.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.389
Please leave me alone.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.257
I'm just giving you shit.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.259
Come outside.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.461
No.

15:38.106 --> 15:42.576
(♪♪♪)

15:42.609 --> 15:44.979
(Howling in distance)

15:45.012 --> 15:53.320
(♪♪♪)

15:53.353 --> 15:54.421
You coming?

15:54.454 --> 16:02.930
(♪♪♪)

16:10.670 --> 16:12.006
You need my help.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.307
What do you mean?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.309
AVERY:
Which Spider Lake is he on?

16:16.343 --> 16:20.848
Minnesota has over 10,000 lakes,
common names like Big Lake,

16:20.882 --> 16:23.617
Bass Lake or Spider Lake
are used multiple times.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.518
How many?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.954
2. 10.

16:30.024 --> 16:32.193
Let's say you do pick
the right lake.

16:32.226 --> 16:34.427
How are you gonna find
this guy's place?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.363
You can't see anything
from the road.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.597
Do you have a boat?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.401
Are you gonna kill him?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.805
This isn't a joke to me.

16:43.838 --> 16:45.840
It's the only thing
I care about.

16:45.873 --> 16:48.142
If Professor Shikenjanski
doesn't get me into his lab,

16:48.176 --> 16:49.509
my life won't matter.

16:49.543 --> 16:50.343
Okay, I get it.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.280
No, you don't.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.315
Evan Ehrenberg was
a PhD candidate by 16.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.684
Rifath Sharook was already
designing satellites.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.521
You probably have no idea who
either of those people are.

17:01.555 --> 17:02.756
AVERY:
And I don't care.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.792
But the hacking thing you did,

17:06.828 --> 17:09.096
could you do it to YouTube
or Instagram?

17:10.231 --> 17:11.798
Could you make it
to where certain videos

17:11.833 --> 17:14.301
are featured more frequently
than they normally would be?

17:14.334 --> 17:15.468
Certain fishing videos?

17:15.502 --> 17:19.638
Could you manipulate the code
or whatever to make sure

17:19.673 --> 17:21.575
my videos pop up
more frequently?

17:21.608 --> 17:22.742
Obviously.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.444
AVERY:
Then I'll make you a deal.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.013
I'll take you around the lake,
so you can stalk your professor

17:27.048 --> 17:28.850
if you promise to boost
my videos.

17:30.918 --> 17:32.887
But if you suddenly jump
from 5,000 views--

17:32.920 --> 17:34.822
I have a lot more
than 5,000 views.

17:34.856 --> 17:36.023
PAULIE:
The video your dad showed me--

17:36.057 --> 17:38.358
Is super old and isn't even
on my main channel.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.759
Are you in or not?

17:42.263 --> 17:45.233
Some of these lakes
have over 50 miles of shoreline.

17:45.266 --> 17:46.766
They have hidden bays,
and islands,

17:46.800 --> 17:47.869
and unmarked streams.

17:47.902 --> 17:48.735
Without my boat, you'll never--

17:48.768 --> 17:50.403
Fine.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.471
I'll do it.

17:52.306 --> 17:53.473
(Sighs)

17:53.506 --> 17:55.009
Great.

18:02.316 --> 18:06.653
(Vocalizing)

18:06.686 --> 18:08.688
Woah!

18:08.722 --> 18:09.824
(Paulie gasping)

18:09.857 --> 18:11.758
It's for the leeches.

18:13.294 --> 18:14.561
(Narrating)
Here's how this is gonna go.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.796
My dad thinks I'm camping with
my friends this weekend,

18:16.831 --> 18:19.000
so I'll be out of the house
by the time you wake up.

18:20.301 --> 18:22.169
When you get in the car,
he'll tell you his

18:22.203 --> 18:24.272
"I saw Prince
jam with Janet Jackson

18:24.305 --> 18:26.340
in 1996" story.

18:27.008 --> 18:28.475
It's super long
and he won't have time

18:28.508 --> 18:29.343
to ask you any questions.

18:31.812 --> 18:33.147
When you pick up
your kidnapper van,

18:33.180 --> 18:34.815
Brandon will probably tell you
about the one time

18:34.849 --> 18:35.816
he took me fishing.

18:35.850 --> 18:36.650
Right?

18:36.683 --> 18:37.218
I'm bringing it back.

18:37.251 --> 18:37.885
I'm bringing it back.

18:37.919 --> 18:39.086
Ah, I caught it.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.520
AVERY: (Narrating)
Don't believe his version.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.756
I had to reel in his fish
after he dropped his cellphone

18:42.789 --> 18:45.159
in the water
and started crying.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.361
Drive 35 miles to Motley.

18:47.395 --> 18:50.097
There's a store there called,
"Moe's".

18:50.131 --> 18:53.134
Buy yourself a couple outfits,
so you can blend in.

18:58.339 --> 18:59.773
Leave your van
in the parking lot

18:59.807 --> 19:00.975
and I'll pick you up.

19:01.008 --> 19:02.276
We'll start with the closest
Spider Lake

19:02.310 --> 19:04.711
and work our way out from there.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.713

19:06.746 --> 19:15.455

19:17.858 --> 19:19.860
Look at you, townie!

There are three properties that
would fit the needs

19:53.027 --> 19:54.195
of Professor Shikenjanski.

19:54.228 --> 19:55.396
No close neighbors,

19:55.429 --> 19:57.264
a building big enough
for a robotics lab,

19:57.298 --> 19:59.733
and a clearing large enough to
land a helicopter.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.170
Why would he need to land
a helicopter?

20:03.204 --> 20:04.504
Because some
of his equipment is...

20:06.273 --> 20:07.707
It'll take too much time

21:13.007 --> 21:15.076
Where?
I don't see anything.

21:15.109 --> 21:17.011
That's the point.

21:17.044 --> 21:18.312
The satellite photos show
a clearing

21:18.345 --> 21:20.747
and a large structure up
over that hill.

21:22.550 --> 21:23.750
Let's go.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.457
Grab it.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.296
Stay here.

21:35.329 --> 21:37.431
Watch out for booby traps.

21:45.973 --> 21:49.310

I heard?

22:45.099 --> 22:45.900
I don't know.

22:45.933 --> 22:46.699
I heard it, too.

22:46.733 --> 22:47.800
Let's go.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.008
Go that way.

22:57.077 --> 22:58.345
What are you doing?

22:58.379 --> 23:00.713
AVERY:
It'll take too much time
to explain.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.158
This is the wrong lot.

23:11.192 --> 23:13.027
AVERY:
Good morning.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.562
Nice day for a cruise.

23:14.595 --> 23:15.762
AVERY:
It's perfect.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.865
Hey, do you know who lives
in that big cabin,

23:17.898 --> 23:19.900
couple lots down?

23:19.934 --> 23:21.936
It's for sale.

23:21.969 --> 23:23.604
She always drive?

23:23.637 --> 23:25.139
I do other things.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.274
It's why I keep him around.

23:27.308 --> 23:28.976
(Chuckles)

23:29.677 --> 23:31.478
Have you ever seen this guy?

23:33.314 --> 23:35.849
No, I'd remember that guy.

23:36.550 --> 23:38.552
What about that lot
out on that point?

23:40.287 --> 23:42.223
Couple bought it last year.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.924
They're Unitarians.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.259
What does that mean?

23:45.292 --> 23:48.095
It means they hug too much
in church.

23:48.128 --> 23:50.730
Does anyone around here drive
a red Chevy Volt?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.601
WOMAN 1:
Not on purpose?

23:54.101 --> 23:54.902
Okay.

23:54.935 --> 23:55.735
Thanks for your help.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.571
WOMAN 1:
No problem.

23:57.605 --> 23:59.607
Enjoy your youth
while you got it, kids,

23:59.640 --> 24:01.774
getting old sucks.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.119
(Birds chirping)

24:13.854 --> 24:16.190
Here's what I don't get.

24:16.223 --> 24:18.392
You're racing to go to college,
but all the big tech guys

24:18.425 --> 24:20.728
dropped out.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.664
You can't drop out of college
if you don't go to college.

24:25.232 --> 24:27.001
I'm not going to college.

24:28.836 --> 24:30.571
PAULIE:
You're not?

24:30.604 --> 24:31.905
I thought--

24:31.939 --> 24:33.841
You don't learn
anything important in college.

24:34.675 --> 24:36.210
My dad doesn't know yet.

24:37.678 --> 24:38.946
I wouldn't care about college
at all

24:38.979 --> 24:40.848
if it weren't for
Professor Shikenjanski.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.083
What's he do that's so cool?

24:45.052 --> 24:47.021
Do you really wanna know
or are you just gonna make

24:47.054 --> 24:48.355
fun of me?

24:48.389 --> 24:49.290
I wanna know.

24:51.225 --> 24:53.160
Professor Shikenjanski
is teaching robots

24:53.193 --> 24:55.462
to have relationships by signing
quantitative value

24:55.496 --> 24:57.298
to emotional interaction.

24:58.499 --> 24:59.733
Why does he need you?

24:59.767 --> 25:00.901
PAULIE:
Because I developed
a compounding

25:00.934 --> 25:02.603
conclusion algorithm
for intuition learning

25:02.636 --> 25:04.238
that could ultimately boost
emotional capacity

25:04.271 --> 25:06.774
by at least 36 percent.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.709
So you're a relationship expert?

25:11.078 --> 25:12.546
Here we go.

25:15.316 --> 25:17.017
Is it big?

25:17.051 --> 25:17.951
Oh, yeah.

25:17.985 --> 25:19.253
In a sec, I'm gonna hand you
the pole.

25:19.286 --> 25:20.087
No, why?

25:20.120 --> 25:21.488
AVERY:
So I could take off my shirt.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.723
What?

25:22.756 --> 25:24.658
First time I did a video
in my bathing suit,

25:24.692 --> 25:26.427
I went
from 100 to 100,000 views.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.129
They don't all get that much,
but it's a lot more

25:29.163 --> 25:31.365
than the videos
on my personal channel.

25:31.398 --> 25:32.433
Does your dad know?

25:32.466 --> 25:34.001
No, don't be stupid.

25:35.436 --> 25:36.603
(Grunts)

25:36.637 --> 25:38.772
Hold it steady, don't let up.

25:47.181 --> 25:48.782
All right, you guys,
got one on the line.

25:48.817 --> 25:50.651
This could be our muskie.

25:50.684 --> 25:52.753
Fish of 10,000 casts.

25:54.355 --> 25:55.656
Oh God, where is it?

25:55.689 --> 25:57.391
Oh, I-- I see some color.

25:58.192 --> 26:00.294
(Grunting)

26:13.173 --> 26:15.409
Damn it.

26:15.442 --> 26:17.144
It's a tiger.

26:18.379 --> 26:20.781
See, a lot of people
would be really excited

26:20.815 --> 26:23.150
about this catch,
but here's the problem.

26:23.183 --> 26:25.652
Tiger muskies aren't real fish.

26:25.686 --> 26:27.888
They were created
in a lab by crossbreeding

26:27.921 --> 26:30.057
northerns and muskies
to make it easier

26:30.090 --> 26:32.926
for lazy fishermen to catch
the big one.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.795
Earn your trophies, people!

26:35.796 --> 26:38.232
I'm not about to let this cyborg
into my boat.

26:42.269 --> 26:43.203
Go ahead.

26:44.972 --> 26:46.540
Till next time.

26:56.818 --> 26:59.019
Do you have a girlfriend,
Paulie?

27:01.121 --> 27:04.591
You ever had a girlfriend,
ever kissed a girl?

27:05.793 --> 27:07.795
I have more important things
to do.

27:08.262 --> 27:09.763
In fact, we--
we shouldn't be wasting time.

27:09.797 --> 27:11.265
We need to keep searching.

27:25.345 --> 27:26.480
(Paulie grunts)

27:26.513 --> 27:28.615
These bugs are ferocious.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.050
Dude, they're just mosquitoes.

27:32.052 --> 27:35.122
(Mosquitoes buzzing)

27:36.957 --> 27:38.158
You Avery?

27:38.192 --> 27:38.927
Yep.

27:38.959 --> 27:40.594
Spoke about an hour ago.

27:42.062 --> 27:44.064
What's his deal?

27:45.065 --> 27:46.901
Not a lot of social skills.

27:46.935 --> 27:49.436
(Chuckles)

27:49.470 --> 27:50.939
Thank you.

27:50.971 --> 27:52.272
Have a good one.

28:05.586 --> 28:07.254
I have social skills.

28:11.692 --> 28:13.962
Why'd you say I don't have
any social skills?

28:15.062 --> 28:17.164
Outside.

28:17.966 --> 28:19.399
I was just joking.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.535
You don't have social skills,
either, you know?

28:21.568 --> 28:23.103
Sure, Paulie,
I have 60,000 followers

28:23.136 --> 28:24.404
and I don't have--

28:24.438 --> 28:25.940
PAULIE:
Who like watching you catch fish
in your bathing suit.

28:25.974 --> 28:27.641
At least, I'm teaching
my audience a skill

28:27.674 --> 28:28.910
I actually possess.

28:28.943 --> 28:30.010
I'm gonna be one
of the greatest scientists

28:30.043 --> 28:31.712
of the 21st century.

28:31.745 --> 28:34.047
How can you teach robots to have
meaningful relationships

28:34.081 --> 28:35.382
when you don't have any friends?

28:35.415 --> 28:37.084
You don't have
any friends either.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.621
I have a lot of friends.

28:40.654 --> 28:42.589
Then how come none
of them texted you today

28:42.623 --> 28:43.892
or yesterday?

28:43.925 --> 28:45.526
What have you been like looking
at my phone or something?

28:45.559 --> 28:46.560
Yes.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.129
(Scoffs)

28:51.064 --> 29:00.173
(♪♪♪)

29:06.079 --> 29:15.222
(♪♪♪)

29:18.625 --> 29:20.460
PAULIE:
Professor definitely doesn't
live here.

29:20.494 --> 29:29.469
(♪♪♪)

29:35.542 --> 29:44.518
(♪♪♪)

30:02.336 --> 30:04.504
I almost kissed a girl once.

30:07.976 --> 30:09.376
Yeah.

30:10.744 --> 30:12.847
I'm pretty sure
she wanted me to do it.

30:16.583 --> 30:17.351
Who was she?

30:17.384 --> 30:19.020
It-- where were you?

30:19.053 --> 30:20.989
It was at math camp.

30:21.022 --> 30:22.322
Of course,
you went to math camp.

30:22.356 --> 30:23.156
You know what?

30:23.190 --> 30:24.892
Uh, sorry, I--

30:24.926 --> 30:26.493
I wanna hear this story.

30:26.526 --> 30:28.328
So it was a girl at math camp.

30:29.796 --> 30:32.366
Last summer,
we were the last two people

30:32.399 --> 30:35.202
to leave the bonfire
on pie night.

30:35.235 --> 30:38.171
What, like you cooked pies
in the fire?

30:38.205 --> 30:40.641
Pie, like the number.

30:40.674 --> 30:43.176
Everyone stays up all night,
'cause, you know,

30:43.210 --> 30:44.678
pie never ends.

30:44.711 --> 30:46.014
(Laughs)

30:47.915 --> 30:50.617
Okay, so you
and this girl are the last two

30:50.651 --> 30:55.555
to leave the pie night bonfire,
and she's pretty cute.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.025
Yeah.

30:57.058 --> 30:58.492
And really smart.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.627
I hope you told her that.

31:00.661 --> 31:02.329
I didn't.

31:03.998 --> 31:05.766
Where was she sitting?

31:05.799 --> 31:06.566
Right next to me.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.734
She put her head on my shoulder.

31:07.768 --> 31:09.403
Oh God.

31:09.436 --> 31:10.470
She wanted you to do it.

31:10.504 --> 31:11.471
That's what I thought.

31:11.505 --> 31:12.974
So what did you do?

31:13.007 --> 31:15.810
I asked her if she could take
her head off my shoulder.

31:15.843 --> 31:16.944
Why?

31:17.979 --> 31:19.881
Because the angle
for the kiss wouldn't work

31:19.914 --> 31:20.882
if her head was there.

31:20.915 --> 31:22.817
Oh God, Paulie.

31:22.850 --> 31:23.985
What?

31:25.385 --> 31:26.854
Nothing.

31:26.888 --> 31:28.755
What happened next?

31:29.623 --> 31:31.725
We just sort
of stared at each other

31:31.758 --> 31:32.693
for a while.

31:32.726 --> 31:33.895
(Chuckles)

31:34.661 --> 31:36.763
Why didn't you make a move?

31:36.797 --> 31:40.634
I thought about it,
but ultimately,

31:40.667 --> 31:43.971
how much do you know about
the Markov decision process?

31:44.005 --> 31:45.106
Hold on, I--

31:45.139 --> 31:47.441
No, she wanted you to kiss her
and you were doing

31:47.474 --> 31:48.810
maths problems.

31:48.843 --> 31:51.545
I was just approximating
initial state probabilities.

31:51.578 --> 31:52.814
And then she left?

31:52.847 --> 31:54.381
She ran away, crying
before I could do anything.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.450
(Scoffs)

31:56.483 --> 31:58.452
What was I supposed to do?

31:58.485 --> 32:00.420
Take a chance.

32:00.454 --> 32:02.255
Follow your heart.

32:02.289 --> 32:04.424
Please tell me
you went after her.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.560
No, I went back to my cabin
and--

32:06.593 --> 32:08.162
Went back to your cabin
and what?

32:10.430 --> 32:11.732
Hand me the binoculars.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.736
I think I see a red Chevy Volt.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.805
It just disappeared
behind those trees.

32:17.839 --> 32:26.814
(♪♪♪)

32:32.887 --> 32:41.829
(♪♪♪)

33:04.886 --> 33:07.387
What if he's not here?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.389
Then we'll look again tomorrow.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.491
We are 100 miles
from the P.O. boxes

33:11.525 --> 33:12.894
where I first saw him.

33:12.927 --> 33:15.796
What if Spider Lake
was just a decoy?

33:15.830 --> 33:16.964
What if it wasn't?

33:21.235 --> 33:23.237
This was a mistake.

33:23.271 --> 33:25.106
I'm so stupid.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.712
(Baby loons calling in distance)

33:40.254 --> 33:43.057
(Imitates baby loon's calling)

33:43.958 --> 33:47.028
(Baby loons calling in distance)

33:50.463 --> 33:52.066
You know what's crazy,

33:52.099 --> 33:54.734
those baby loons
were born this spring

33:54.768 --> 33:56.570
and in a couple of months
they'll down

33:56.603 --> 33:58.438
to the Gulf of Mexico
all by themselves.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.776
What about the parents?

34:04.578 --> 34:06.513
The parents teach them
everything they know

34:06.546 --> 34:08.014
and then take off.

34:10.150 --> 34:14.088
So the kids just figure it out
as they go?

34:15.422 --> 34:17.357
They just figure it out.

34:24.831 --> 34:26.399
Where's your mom?

34:34.342 --> 34:35.810
I don't know.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.984
My dad died when I was little.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.255
Sorry.

34:48.788 --> 34:50.224
He would have been
a really important scientist

34:50.257 --> 34:51.259
if he hadn't.

34:53.293 --> 34:54.829
He was awesome.

34:58.798 --> 35:00.268
Yeah, my mom wasn't.

35:05.172 --> 35:08.309
(Baby loons calling in distance)

35:09.944 --> 35:11.711
PAULIE:
Where did they just go?

35:12.213 --> 35:13.713
Yeah, that was weird, right?

35:13.747 --> 35:22.857
(♪♪♪)

35:28.762 --> 35:37.872

35:42.843 --> 35:43.978
AVERY:
It can't be private.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.213
All Minnesota waterways
are public.

35:50.384 --> 35:51.718
Let's go.

36:47.875 --> 36:56.984

37:26.746 --> 37:28.115

Damn it!

37:28.149 --> 37:29.150
It's a sand bar.

37:29.183 --> 37:31.751
CHUCK:
Good evening, Paulie Go.

37:35.456 --> 37:36.723
It's him.

37:40.627 --> 37:43.097
AVERY:
How does he know your name?

37:44.131 --> 37:46.267
CHUCK:
Beautiful night, isn't it?

37:48.302 --> 37:50.004
Say something.

37:50.037 --> 37:51.138
Professor Shikenjanski?

37:51.172 --> 37:53.140
Call me "Chuck".

37:54.108 --> 37:55.342
Okay.

37:57.011 --> 37:58.711
Chuck, okay.

38:01.681 --> 38:03.884
AVERY:
How do we get over there,
Chuck?

38:05.219 --> 38:07.521
CHUCK:
How did you find this place?

38:07.555 --> 38:10.590
I hacked the university's
human resource department.

38:13.861 --> 38:15.795
CHUCK:
Outstanding.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.465
Thanks.

38:17.932 --> 38:20.600
Maybe you should tell them about
all your other crimes.

38:22.303 --> 38:25.206
CHUCK:
What can I do for you, Paulie?

38:26.373 --> 38:28.641
I developed a compounding
conclusion algorithm

38:28.675 --> 38:30.677
for intuition learning that
could ultimately boost

38:30.710 --> 38:34.115
emotional capacity
by at least 36 percent.

38:34.148 --> 38:36.250
CHUCK:
Simulated or realised?

38:37.351 --> 38:39.553
Realised, obviously.

38:41.055 --> 38:43.690
CHUCK:
Outstanding.

38:44.724 --> 38:46.360
PAULIE:
I can save you
at least six months

38:46.393 --> 38:48.728
of development on
conclusion conversions alone.

38:50.564 --> 38:52.732
CHUCK:
What do you want?

38:55.002 --> 38:57.204
Let him in your lab.

38:58.806 --> 39:00.307
CHUCK:
Well, that's not something I do.

39:00.341 --> 39:01.909
I'm sorry.

39:01.942 --> 39:03.811
Just review my work.

39:03.844 --> 39:05.212
Please,
you'll see what I'm capable of,

39:05.246 --> 39:06.313
but we would be capable if you--

39:06.347 --> 39:08.349
CHUCK:
I'll consider it.

39:22.396 --> 39:23.931
AVERY:
Is that it?

39:30.971 --> 39:32.439
We should go.

39:36.443 --> 39:38.412
Paulie.

39:39.513 --> 39:48.589
(♪♪♪)

40:14.648 --> 40:17.084
Dude, that guy was super weird.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.690
Genius is often misunderstood.

40:22.755 --> 40:24.091
Maybe.

40:24.124 --> 40:26.160
But he could also be hiding
local schoolchildren

40:26.193 --> 40:27.828
in his basement.

40:28.462 --> 40:30.598
What's with all the security?

40:30.631 --> 40:32.967
We're not the only ones
looking for him.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.368
Who else?

40:34.401 --> 40:37.504
PAULIE:
The government,
the Swedes, business leaders,

40:37.538 --> 40:40.007
anyone who cares about
technological innovation.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.775
But why can't they just meet
with him on campus?

40:42.810 --> 40:45.479
Because Professor Shikenjanski
is never on campus.

40:45.512 --> 40:47.514
He lectures remotely.

40:47.548 --> 40:49.316
AVERY:
Seriously?

40:49.350 --> 40:50.618
That way,
he doesn't have to waste time

40:50.651 --> 40:52.720
with people when he could be
doing research.

40:53.954 --> 40:56.023
Or he's actually
a super villain?

41:04.898 --> 41:06.700
He should have asked
more questions.

41:06.734 --> 41:08.102
AVERY:
And invited you.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.769
Exactly.

41:10.437 --> 41:12.039
I mean, no, he just--

41:15.509 --> 41:18.045
I could help him
change the world.

41:18.078 --> 41:19.847
I would make him proud.

41:21.048 --> 41:22.549
I would.

41:27.388 --> 41:29.123
He said he'd consider your work.

41:31.725 --> 41:33.227
He didn't mean it.

41:35.229 --> 41:36.530
AVERY:
No.

41:36.563 --> 41:38.432
No way.

41:38.465 --> 41:41.702
Paulie, now is not the time
to be sad.

41:41.735 --> 41:46.340
You just executed a successful
cross-country manhunt.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.042
That's amazing.

41:49.310 --> 41:51.178
And we need to celebrate.

42:00.954 --> 42:02.690
Tadaa!

42:04.425 --> 42:05.859
Mini golf?

42:05.893 --> 42:07.961
AVERY:
I work here part time.

42:07.995 --> 42:09.897
What color ball do you want?

42:15.936 --> 42:17.806
I don't really feel like playing
right now.

42:17.838 --> 42:20.274
Got you something for that.

42:20.307 --> 42:22.109
Take a sip.

42:28.215 --> 42:28.982
(Coughs)

42:29.016 --> 42:29.717
(Laughs)

42:29.750 --> 42:30.984
Tastes like cinnamon gasoline.

42:31.018 --> 42:32.821
I think that's their slogan.

42:32.853 --> 42:33.420
You want some?

42:33.454 --> 42:34.555
I'm driving.

42:34.588 --> 42:35.956
Right.

42:37.758 --> 42:39.727
You're up.

42:46.333 --> 42:47.968
Cut it out.

42:48.736 --> 42:50.304
Stop thinking about
the professor.

42:50.337 --> 42:51.840
If he doesn't realise
how brilliant you are,

42:51.872 --> 42:52.906
than he's stupid.

42:52.940 --> 42:53.808
But he's the smartest--

42:53.842 --> 42:55.442
AVERY:
Enough!

42:57.846 --> 42:59.546
You don't wanna play golf.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.815
Fine.

43:00.849 --> 43:03.050
Then let's dance.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.385
Come on.

43:04.418 --> 43:06.086
No one's here.

43:11.558 --> 43:14.061
Let me see some moves.

43:17.231 --> 43:19.767
Let go, Paulie.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.836
Just have fun.

43:29.343 --> 43:30.978
Yeah.

43:32.012 --> 43:34.982
(Indistinct lyrics)

43:35.015 --> 43:44.091
(♪♪♪)

43:53.167 --> 43:55.135
(Laughing)

43:55.736 --> 43:57.438
Oh, I love this one.

44:04.611 --> 44:07.481
I'm at the edge
of the sunset

44:07.514 --> 44:09.950
I'm looking in on my wall

44:09.983 --> 44:12.653
Indecisions,
I can hear my inhibition

44:12.686 --> 44:15.222
(Indistinct lyrics)

44:15.255 --> 44:19.226
Sorry, dude, we're just buddies.

44:22.563 --> 44:25.632
Thank you for picking me though.

44:26.066 --> 44:27.936
It means a lot.

44:52.894 --> 44:55.062
(Avery coughing)

45:03.370 --> 45:06.306
(Vomiting)

45:09.776 --> 45:11.980
Are you okay?

45:17.518 --> 45:26.059
Okey-dokey, Miss Anderson,
your condition is not normally

45:26.093 --> 45:27.060
a cause for concern

45:27.094 --> 45:28.963
in the early stages
of pregnancy.

45:28.997 --> 45:29.898
10 weeks?

45:29.931 --> 45:32.266
8, I think.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.601
DOCTOR:
Come in.

45:34.635 --> 45:36.971
I found a dashing young
father-to-be

45:37.005 --> 45:37.972
wandering the halls.

45:38.006 --> 45:38.907
Jesus.

45:38.940 --> 45:40.507
What?

45:40.541 --> 45:43.577
NURSE:
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

45:43.610 --> 45:45.679
I thought-- oh my God.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.681
What's going on?

45:47.714 --> 45:49.683
Are we done?

45:49.716 --> 45:54.354
Maybe limited vaginal bleeding
or spotting is not a major deal,

45:54.388 --> 45:55.722
but if the bleeding
gets heavier,

45:55.756 --> 45:59.226
it could foreshadow
an ectopic pregnancy

45:59.259 --> 46:01.061
or a miscarriage
in the second trimester.

46:01.094 --> 46:02.596
Heavy...

46:02.629 --> 46:05.799
Could signal
placental abruption.

46:14.675 --> 46:17.678
(Indistinct song playing
in background)

46:28.121 --> 46:31.124
So what are you gonna do
about your videos?

46:33.027 --> 46:34.361
What do you mean?

46:34.394 --> 46:36.463
Are you still gonna make
fishing videos when you get...

46:38.732 --> 46:40.767
Yeah.

46:40.801 --> 46:42.971
I'll probably do 'em topless,
so people don't pay attention

46:43.004 --> 46:45.172
to the fact that I'm...

46:46.808 --> 46:48.009
Really?

46:48.042 --> 46:49.978
No.

46:50.011 --> 46:52.145
What kind of question is that?

46:52.179 --> 46:54.849
I don't know, sorry.

46:57.384 --> 46:59.720
Is the dad the guy
who dumped you?

47:00.621 --> 47:02.756
How do you know about that?

47:02.789 --> 47:04.025
I--

47:04.058 --> 47:05.860
Of course, you know about that.

47:05.893 --> 47:08.195
What did you do,
look through my phone again?

47:08.228 --> 47:08.963
Your dad told me.

47:08.997 --> 47:11.198
Told you what?

47:11.231 --> 47:12.299
That Clint's a pothead
who dumped me

47:12.332 --> 47:13.935
after I had a nervous breakdown.

47:15.168 --> 47:16.503
He told me the pothead part.

47:16.536 --> 47:18.639
(Scoffs)

47:19.306 --> 47:20.674
Why did you have
a nervous breakdown?

47:20.707 --> 47:22.709
Because I messed up!

47:23.377 --> 47:25.212
And I'm turning into my mom.

47:28.049 --> 47:30.384
She was pregnant at 18, too.

47:33.955 --> 47:39.726
My dad thought he was gonna be
an air force pilot

47:39.760 --> 47:41.062
or a rock star.

47:41.095 --> 47:42.930
But he got to have you.

47:47.935 --> 47:52.539
Paulie, you may be a genius,
but you don't know shit.

47:56.276 --> 47:59.413
(Sobbing)

48:26.773 --> 48:30.410
At least, you don't really need
to be concerned about

48:30.444 --> 48:32.814
an ectopic pregnancy
or placental abruption.

48:35.883 --> 48:38.785
That doctor was so weird,
it's like he couldn't shut up.

48:38.820 --> 48:40.787
It was like he malfunctioned.

48:42.589 --> 48:44.591
His patterns were actually
kind of robotic,

48:44.624 --> 48:47.360
the way he held onto words
was like an auto-engager.

48:47.394 --> 48:48.762
What's an auto-engager?

48:48.795 --> 48:51.732
It's um, a reoccurring tic
or gesture that's meant to

48:51.765 --> 48:53.567
endear the bot to actual humans,

48:53.600 --> 48:55.736
but it's said that bots
often deploy

48:55.769 --> 48:58.906
in obvious gestures like winking
or whistling.

48:58.940 --> 49:00.607
Or repeating the same
generic response

49:00.640 --> 49:03.010
over and over again.

49:05.512 --> 49:06.914
Holy shit.

49:08.648 --> 49:10.517
(Together)
Outstanding!

49:12.220 --> 49:14.688
No, it can't be.

49:14.721 --> 49:16.323
Shikenjanski would have to be
so far ahead

49:16.356 --> 49:17.257
of the rest of the world--

49:17.290 --> 49:18.492
Right?

49:18.525 --> 49:20.560
And he wouldn't wanna keep
that a secret.

49:20.594 --> 49:22.230
Actually, he would.

49:22.262 --> 49:23.597
The public is worried

49:23.630 --> 49:25.432
that robots are going to
overthrow human civilisation,

49:25.465 --> 49:28.301
so every major advancement is
met with waves of regulatory

49:28.335 --> 49:29.137
and ethical challenges.

49:29.170 --> 49:30.104
That sounds smart.

49:30.138 --> 49:30.905
It's insane.

49:30.938 --> 49:33.473
This whole conversation
is insane.

49:35.308 --> 49:36.978
You wanna go back?

49:37.011 --> 49:45.987
(♪♪♪)

49:52.093 --> 50:01.002
(♪♪♪)

50:09.376 --> 50:11.444
Supposed to be
a road coming.

50:11.478 --> 50:12.712
I don't see anything.

50:18.085 --> 50:19.486
Stop!

50:19.519 --> 50:21.189
There.

50:21.222 --> 50:23.224
(Avery sighs)

50:23.257 --> 50:32.266
(♪♪♪)

50:55.022 --> 50:58.326
Uh, Professor, this is Paulie
Go.

50:58.358 --> 51:01.062
We spoke earlier in the lake.

51:01.095 --> 51:02.395
On the lake.

51:04.798 --> 51:06.000
(Avery sighs)

51:07.801 --> 51:09.769
Look, we know your secret.

51:09.804 --> 51:11.438
Why would you say that?

51:11.471 --> 51:12.940
(Sighs)

51:31.625 --> 51:32.759
I don't get it.

51:32.792 --> 51:34.829
There's no space for a lab.

51:34.862 --> 51:37.064
Plenty of space
to stash bodies, though

51:37.098 --> 51:38.765
The bodies aren't the problem,
it's all the equipment

51:38.798 --> 51:39.799
and servers.

51:39.834 --> 51:41.401
We're talking about
different things.

51:41.434 --> 51:43.070
What are you doing here?

51:43.104 --> 51:45.472
Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry, ma'am.

51:45.505 --> 51:46.340
There's been a mistake.

51:46.374 --> 51:47.842
We're in the wrong place.

51:47.875 --> 51:49.776
Who knows you're here?

51:51.012 --> 51:52.712
Where is the professor?

51:52.746 --> 51:54.949
The professor is
a very private person.

51:54.982 --> 51:57.651
And doesn't appreciate people
sneaking on his property.

51:57.684 --> 51:59.353
AVERY:
We called from the gate.

51:59.387 --> 52:00.988
But you didn't have
an appointment, did you?

52:01.022 --> 52:02.589
Do you work for the professor?

52:02.622 --> 52:05.659
Look, if you leave
before the professor gets back,

52:05.692 --> 52:06.493
I won't--

52:06.526 --> 52:07.328
Too late.

52:07.361 --> 52:08.896
Paulie Go and friends.

52:08.930 --> 52:09.897
OUTDOORS WOMAN:
Shit!

52:09.931 --> 52:13.234
Great to see you again.

52:13.267 --> 52:15.702
OUTDOORS WOMAN:
Chuck, disengage and get back
in the house.

52:15.735 --> 52:17.872
Outstanding.

52:21.474 --> 52:22.143
Woah.

52:22.176 --> 52:23.311
What the--

52:28.515 --> 52:29.850
You're the professor.

52:29.884 --> 52:31.185
(Both scream)

52:31.218 --> 52:34.288
(Woman taking deep breaths)

52:35.856 --> 52:37.358
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
I'm so sorry.

52:37.391 --> 52:39.360
I didn't mean to do that,
I didn't mean to do that.

52:39.393 --> 52:39.827
I hate guns.

52:39.860 --> 52:40.928
I just--

52:43.064 --> 52:46.466
Please just-- just come inside,
just come inside.

52:46.499 --> 52:47.634
I'm sorry.

52:47.667 --> 52:56.543
(♪♪♪)

52:59.380 --> 53:00.580
You coming?

53:04.251 --> 53:08.089
I don't host visitors,
so I'm afraid

53:08.122 --> 53:09.890
I don't really have any snacks.

53:11.758 --> 53:13.760
You've got all the Santa fish.

53:13.793 --> 53:15.930
Yeah, Maltby's Department Store

53:15.963 --> 53:17.898
used to sell a new one
of these every Christmas.

53:17.932 --> 53:20.633
Until they closed in 2012.

53:20.667 --> 53:22.103
So you grew up here.

53:22.136 --> 53:23.270
I grew up in the cities.

53:23.304 --> 53:25.106
But your bio says you grew up
in New York.

53:25.139 --> 53:26.740
That's Chuck's bio.

53:26.773 --> 53:28.142
Oh my God.

53:28.175 --> 53:29.443
You've got the muskie.

53:29.477 --> 53:31.078
Please be careful with that
one, it's very rare.

53:31.112 --> 53:33.646
Oh, s-- sorry.

53:33.680 --> 53:36.283
When I was little,
I wanted the Santa muskie

53:36.317 --> 53:37.550
so bad.

53:37.584 --> 53:39.220
But my parents could only find
the tiger muskie on eBay.

53:39.253 --> 53:41.155
Ugh, I hate tiger muskies.

53:41.188 --> 53:42.689
AVERY:
Right?

53:42.722 --> 53:44.358
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
I-- I really should have them
in a case.

53:44.392 --> 53:46.760
But Chuck likes them out, so.

53:46.793 --> 53:48.396
Chuck likes things?

53:48.429 --> 53:50.498
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
Of course.

53:51.298 --> 53:53.100
So why did you come here?

53:53.134 --> 53:54.101
Because I developed

53:54.135 --> 53:55.436
a compounding
conclusion algorithm

53:55.469 --> 53:56.937
for intuition learning
that could ultimately--

53:56.971 --> 53:58.605
Yeah, yeah, 36 percent,
I know,

53:58.638 --> 53:59.606
you said that last night.

53:59.639 --> 54:01.308
You were there?

54:01.342 --> 54:04.644
No, she patched
into Chuck's audio interceptors.

54:05.179 --> 54:06.679
That's right.

54:06.713 --> 54:08.681
PAULIE:
Don't you have fully-integrated
comm override?

54:08.715 --> 54:10.550
Yes, but not remotely.

54:10.583 --> 54:12.186
Chuck was fully autonomous
on the dock.

54:12.219 --> 54:13.120
His auto-engager--

54:13.154 --> 54:15.856
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
I am...

54:15.890 --> 54:18.092
...working on that,
it's very tricky.

54:19.592 --> 54:21.295
I want to work with you.

54:21.962 --> 54:23.097
I don't work with other people.

54:23.130 --> 54:24.465
Me neither.

54:24.498 --> 54:25.598
What about her?

54:25.632 --> 54:27.268
She makes fishing videos.

54:27.301 --> 54:28.335
Why?

54:29.470 --> 54:31.839
Professor,
in addition to my algorithm,

54:31.872 --> 54:33.174
I developed my own methodology

54:33.207 --> 54:34.774
for emotional evaluation
regressions.

54:34.809 --> 54:36.811
Can you scale from individual
to group dynamics?

54:36.844 --> 54:38.778
Obviously.

54:38.813 --> 54:40.347
Interesting.

54:40.381 --> 54:42.550
AVERY:
Why did you build a man?

54:43.484 --> 54:45.519
Uh, for your secret identity?

54:46.554 --> 54:49.323
Uh, computer science wasn't
exactly friendly to people

54:49.356 --> 54:50.690
who looked like me.

54:52.359 --> 54:54.128
But it's better now, right?

54:58.065 --> 54:59.133
Where's the restroom?

54:59.166 --> 55:00.835
End of the hall.

55:04.205 --> 55:05.672
Don't touch anything.

55:16.550 --> 55:20.387
AVERY:
So how'd you pick the name,
Chuck?

55:20.421 --> 55:21.721
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
Honestly...

55:23.924 --> 55:25.792
...I named him after Chucky.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.229
Chucky.

55:28.262 --> 55:30.431
The doll that comes to life
and kills people.

55:31.999 --> 55:33.300
Oh.

55:33.334 --> 55:35.903
I know, I know,
it's-- it's weird.

55:36.270 --> 55:37.571
But got a messed-up sense
of humor.

55:37.605 --> 55:39.672
No.

55:39.706 --> 55:40.875
That's badass.

55:42.109 --> 55:51.218
(♪♪♪)

55:57.091 --> 56:06.267
(♪♪♪)

56:13.673 --> 56:15.742
Hey, Chuck.

56:15.775 --> 56:24.684
(♪♪♪)

56:30.757 --> 56:39.766
(♪♪♪)

56:48.042 --> 56:50.010
Oh, wait a second,
so you got the job before--

56:50.044 --> 56:51.278
Ah, Chuck got the job.

56:51.312 --> 56:52.846
Right, Chuck got the job

56:52.880 --> 56:54.815
even though Chuck
didn't exist yet.

56:54.848 --> 56:57.551
The university awarded Chuck
several million dollars

56:57.585 --> 56:59.186
to build a remote lab.

56:59.220 --> 57:00.287
There in on it, right?

57:00.321 --> 57:01.922
I mean,
they would have to be in on it.

57:01.956 --> 57:03.657
The only people who know
the truth about Chuck

57:03.691 --> 57:05.693
are the president
of the university,

57:05.725 --> 57:07.595
the head of the computer science
department,

57:07.628 --> 57:10.030
and one very wealthy trustee.

57:10.064 --> 57:11.365
And us.

57:11.398 --> 57:13.067
I suppose.

57:14.401 --> 57:16.437
What are you gonna tell people?

57:16.470 --> 57:17.938
I mean, Chuck's amazing.

57:17.972 --> 57:20.574
Don't you want people to see
your research?

57:20.608 --> 57:23.477
Your generation cares too much
about credit.

57:23.510 --> 57:25.980
It's not about the credit.

57:26.013 --> 57:27.181
It's about the work.

57:29.049 --> 57:31.118
Exactly.

57:31.151 --> 57:33.287
But don't you want to inspire
other people?

57:33.320 --> 57:35.322
The work is everything.

57:35.356 --> 57:37.224
Professor, Chuck's door
was open,

57:37.258 --> 57:40.094
but I didn't see any servers
or docking equipment.

57:40.127 --> 57:41.829
Where are all the processors?

57:41.862 --> 57:44.098
Are they running simulations
while he charges?

57:44.498 --> 57:45.666
It's a good question.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.535
Let me show you.

57:48.569 --> 57:57.678
(♪♪♪)

58:02.049 --> 58:03.450
Are those brainwaves?

58:03.484 --> 58:05.085
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
In a way.

58:06.053 --> 58:07.488
When Chuck isn't interacting
with me,

58:07.521 --> 58:09.556
he reprocesses his day.

58:09.590 --> 58:11.191
Like a dream?

58:11.225 --> 58:12.826
Reinforcement learning.

58:12.860 --> 58:14.395
Wow.

58:14.428 --> 58:15.896
How did you build this?

58:17.665 --> 58:20.634
I told local contractors
it was a high-tech bomb shelter

58:20.668 --> 58:22.236
for the nuclear apocalypse.

58:22.269 --> 58:23.437
And they believed it?

58:23.470 --> 58:25.639
They didn't understand why some
of the equipment had to be

58:25.673 --> 58:26.640
brought in by helicopter, but--

58:26.674 --> 58:27.641
I knew it.

58:27.675 --> 58:31.178
I mean, people are ridiculous.

58:31.211 --> 58:32.880
Beyond ridiculous.

58:50.397 --> 58:51.932
Can I get you anything?

58:51.965 --> 58:55.703
Water, oat milk, a piña colada?

58:55.736 --> 58:57.171
A piña colada?

58:57.204 --> 59:00.741
It's a frozen beverage,
3 ounces pineapple juice,

59:00.774 --> 59:02.843
1 ounce white rum, 1 ounce co--

59:02.876 --> 59:06.380
AVERY:
I-- I don't want a piña colada.

59:06.413 --> 59:08.349
No problem.

59:17.224 --> 59:19.293
Remind me of your name.

59:21.261 --> 59:25.232
Uh, my name is Beyoncé.

59:25.265 --> 59:26.967
Of course.

59:28.569 --> 59:30.637
(Chuckles)

59:30.671 --> 59:31.772
Chuck?

59:31.806 --> 59:33.941
CHUCK:
Yes, Beyoncé.

59:35.476 --> 59:37.144
What is the capital of Zimbabwe?

59:37.177 --> 59:38.779
Harare.

59:40.981 --> 59:43.484
How big was the largest
freshwater bass ever caught?

59:43.517 --> 59:46.954
22 pounds, 4 ounces.

59:46.987 --> 59:49.590
It was caught on Lake Montgomery
in the state of Georgia

59:49.623 --> 59:53.026
by George Perry
on June 2nd, 1932.

59:54.128 --> 59:56.530
(Chuckles)

59:56.563 --> 59:59.733
Would you like to try Qigong,
Beyoncé?

01:00:00.401 --> 01:00:04.004
Uh, sure.

01:00:04.772 --> 01:00:07.307
Outstanding.

01:00:17.886 --> 01:00:20.554
Do you feel present, Beyoncé?

01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:23.924
I feel different.

01:00:26.627 --> 01:00:28.996
CHUCK:
Tell me about your work.

01:00:30.464 --> 01:00:33.534
Uh, I'm a ninja.

01:00:33.567 --> 01:00:35.302
CHUCK:
Of course.

01:00:35.335 --> 01:00:37.638
Do you still keep
in touch with your colleagues

01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:39.841
from grad school?

01:00:39.874 --> 01:00:43.010
I didn't go to grad school.

01:00:43.043 --> 01:00:46.380
Oh, people can be such bullies.

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:49.049
What?

01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:54.354
People, they can be such bullies
when they are jealous

01:00:54.388 --> 01:00:56.891
of your intellect
and accomplishments.

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:01.028
Is that what
Professor Shikenjanski says?

01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:04.364
That's what Cheryl says.

01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:05.732
Cheryl.

01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:08.903
(Both laugh)

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.579
Who helped you with this?

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:20.547
I wrote everything myself.

01:01:20.581 --> 01:01:22.316
Huh.

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:24.886
There were very few mistakes
in the architecture.

01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:26.253
What mistakes?

01:01:27.387 --> 01:01:29.656
Well,
if this algorithm were to work,

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.659
the emotional range you aspire
to integrate is far too broad.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:35.696
Like Chuck's range is about
60 percent of the spectrum.

01:01:35.729 --> 01:01:38.065
60 percent is a dog.

01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:39.733
You're wrong.

01:01:39.766 --> 01:01:42.236
AVERY: (On camera)
What else do you and Cheryl
do for fun?

01:01:42.269 --> 01:01:44.438
CHUCK: (On camera)
Cheryl loves canoeing.

01:01:44.471 --> 01:01:49.109
She also loves camping,
a hot cup of tea, and snuggling.

01:01:51.278 --> 01:01:54.715
Do you snuggle with Cheryl?

01:01:54.748 --> 01:01:55.616
Whose Cheryl?

01:01:55.649 --> 01:01:56.483
(Shushes)

01:01:58.018 --> 01:01:59.520
Hey, Chuck.

01:01:59.553 --> 01:02:01.321
Who's this guy?

01:02:01.355 --> 01:02:04.658
CHUCK:
Dr. Roman Green was the sweetest
and strongest man

01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:06.326
who ever lived.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.595
He had a way
of holding you that let you know

01:02:08.629 --> 01:02:10.797
you were safe.

01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:13.567
You sure look a lot like him.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.671
CHUCK:
My nose isn't quite right
and my laugh needs to be warmer.

01:02:17.704 --> 01:02:19.007
No.

01:02:20.808 --> 01:02:21.843
CHUCK:
Boundary Waters Canoe--

01:02:21.876 --> 01:02:24.177
Chuck, go for a walk now!

01:02:25.546 --> 01:02:26.848
How dare you?

01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:30.018
You have no right to ask Chuck
about my relationships.

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:30.818
I'm sorry.

01:02:30.852 --> 01:02:32.020
You need to leave.

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.554
Both of you need to leave.

01:02:33.587 --> 01:02:34.421
What did I do?

01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:35.990
You brought a snoop
into my house.

01:02:36.024 --> 01:02:37.025
Uh, I wasn't snooping.

01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:38.525
It's obvious they look the same.

01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:39.827
Enough!

01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:40.828
What about my work?

01:02:40.862 --> 01:02:42.030
I don't care!

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.764
Paulie, she's in love
with her robot.

01:02:45.799 --> 01:02:48.937
Chuck is on his way
to expressing a full range

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.103
of human emotions,

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:52.439
but without the pollution
of human flaws.

01:02:52.472 --> 01:02:55.475
Bonding without jealousy,
persuasion without bullying.

01:02:55.509 --> 01:02:56.643
He'll be perfect.

01:02:56.677 --> 01:02:58.345
He'll be a tiger muskie!

01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:02.349
Get out now!

01:03:04.986 --> 01:03:06.620
PAULIE:
No, this isn't fair!

01:03:06.653 --> 01:03:08.221
Out!

01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:14.028
Professor, please!

01:03:14.062 --> 01:03:15.762
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
If I see or hear from
either one of you again,

01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:17.397
I will call the FBI.

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:21.134
(Sighs)

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:30.310
(♪♪♪)

01:03:49.463 --> 01:03:52.265
Why couldn't you just
keep your mouth shut?

01:03:52.299 --> 01:03:53.700
Paulie, she's delusional.

01:03:53.734 --> 01:03:56.203
She's seven full years ahead
of the entire world.

01:03:56.236 --> 01:03:58.271
She's afraid
of the entire world.

01:03:58.305 --> 01:03:59.807
No, she's afraid the world
will slow her down

01:03:59.841 --> 01:04:01.475
and she's right.

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:03.111
She's afraid that people
like you will judge her,

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:04.511
and label her,

01:04:04.544 --> 01:04:05.847
and prevent her from reaching
her true potential.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.547
She is or you are?

01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:10.018
You don't get it.

01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:11.986
What don't I get?

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.388
Greatness, ambition.

01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:16.024
You're hiding from your life
in a fishing boat.

01:04:16.057 --> 01:04:17.892
At least, I've lived.

01:04:17.925 --> 01:04:20.828
At least, I don't spend my life
working on robots,

01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:22.964
because I'm scared
of human relationships.

01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:24.464
At least,
I didn't get knocked up.

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:27.801
(Together)
Shit.

01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:31.738
Are you okay, Chuck?

01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:35.242
391,000 people were injured
last year

01:04:35.275 --> 01:04:37.912
in car accidents involving
a distracted driver.

01:04:37.945 --> 01:04:39.680
AVERY:
Shut up!

01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:41.348
Either one of you
open your mouths

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:43.017
and I'm leaving you both
in a ditch.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:54.795
(♪♪♪)

01:05:00.968 --> 01:05:09.844
(♪♪♪)

01:05:18.318 --> 01:05:19.120
AVERY:
Shit.

01:05:19.153 --> 01:05:19.987
PAULIE:
What did you do?

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:21.722
I didn't do anything.

01:05:22.255 --> 01:05:23.757
Maybe he just wants to pass us.

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:24.324
Yeah.

01:05:24.357 --> 01:05:25.392
What's the speed limit?

01:05:25.425 --> 01:05:26.593
The speed limit
is the maximum speed

01:05:26.626 --> 01:05:28.261
at which a car
can legally drive in--

01:05:28.295 --> 01:05:30.131
(Together)
Shut up!

01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:43.310
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
You two are in lot of trouble.

01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:44.979
Dad?

01:05:45.012 --> 01:05:47.181
You were lucky, I'm the one
that found you first.

01:05:47.215 --> 01:05:48.816
Sir, are you okay?

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.151
Outstanding.

01:05:50.184 --> 01:05:51.718
Okay.

01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:57.125
(Birds chirping)

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.562
You two need to talk to me.

01:06:02.596 --> 01:06:04.932
Why would this woman say
you kidnapped the professor

01:06:04.966 --> 01:06:05.465
if you didn't?

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:06.800
Because she's nuts.

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:09.803
Nope, that's not good enough.

01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:11.505
Every sheriff's department
north of St. Cloud

01:06:11.538 --> 01:06:13.908
is looking for you.

01:06:13.941 --> 01:06:16.144
This is serious.

01:06:16.177 --> 01:06:19.113
Would you like to try Qigong?

01:06:19.147 --> 01:06:21.348
Uh, no.

01:06:21.681 --> 01:06:23.416
Wait, what?

01:06:23.918 --> 01:06:27.088
(Dog barking in background)

01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:29.523
Is that doggie domesticated?

01:06:29.556 --> 01:06:31.358
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
One across the street?

01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.325
Hmm.

01:06:32.359 --> 01:06:35.196
Hardly, but professor, we--

01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:37.731
(Chuck whistling)

01:06:37.764 --> 01:06:39.466
CHUCK:
Where are you, doggie?

01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:41.501
What is his deal?

01:06:42.569 --> 01:06:44.806
Avery.

01:06:46.706 --> 01:06:49.811
Look, I-- I can't help you
unless I know everything.

01:06:49.844 --> 01:06:51.879
Alright, you need to tell me
everything.

01:06:55.582 --> 01:06:57.584
Paulie.

01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:01.255
Paulie.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:08.229
Go ahead, Paulie.

01:07:08.262 --> 01:07:10.865
Tell him everything.

01:07:10.898 --> 01:07:13.100
I'm done being an accessory.

01:07:13.134 --> 01:07:14.969
An accessory to what?

01:07:17.939 --> 01:07:21.008
Avery's not going to college
and she's pregnant.

01:07:25.146 --> 01:07:27.480
Is that true?

01:07:27.514 --> 01:07:29.749
(Sighs)

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:42.096
Why wouldn't you tell me?

01:07:42.296 --> 01:07:44.866
Is that a joke?

01:07:44.899 --> 01:07:47.301
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
Honey.

01:07:49.103 --> 01:07:51.705
I didn't tell you,
because I'm your daughter!

01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:56.177
Which means when I get scared,
I go fishing

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:58.578
and pretend my problems
don't exist

01:07:58.612 --> 01:08:00.948
or I run away like mom.

01:08:00.982 --> 01:08:01.983
Avery.

01:08:06.419 --> 01:08:07.554
(Sighs)

01:08:07.587 --> 01:08:10.557
(Dog barking in background)

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.927
CHUCK:
Come here, doggie.

01:08:15.196 --> 01:08:16.796
Chuck.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.001
Chuck, get out of the road.

01:08:20.968 --> 01:08:24.372
Is that doggie
33 percent terrier?

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:25.604
I don't know.

01:08:25.639 --> 01:08:27.341
Come back right now,
that's a direct command.

01:08:31.511 --> 01:08:33.214
Chuck!

01:08:40.321 --> 01:08:42.589
TRUCK DRIVER:
Oh my God, oh my God,
it's not my fault.

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:44.191
He just ran right out
onto the road.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.559
What the heck?

01:08:46.593 --> 01:08:55.502
(♪♪♪)

01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:03.510
Ma'am, you need to tell me
your brother's date of birth.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:04.678
I told you it's irrelevant.

01:09:04.711 --> 01:09:05.979
It's protocol.

01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:07.948
If we don't follow protocol,
we can't do our jobs.

01:09:07.982 --> 01:09:09.817
Lady, we have a lot to do.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:11.618
So if you're not
gonna be helpful, I--

01:09:11.651 --> 01:09:13.154
Nothing you were doing

01:09:13.187 --> 01:09:15.423
and nothing you have ever done
is as important as finding

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:17.024
my companion.

01:09:17.058 --> 01:09:18.524
You mean your brother?

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.294
Just frickin' find him!

01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:23.163
Hey, where's Chuck?

01:09:24.064 --> 01:09:25.131
Step into my office.

01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:26.067
Where did you take him?

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.368
He chose to get in the truck.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:28.368
You kidnapped him.

01:09:28.402 --> 01:09:32.038
Technically, it's theft.
My office, now!

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:39.612
Look.

01:09:39.645 --> 01:09:42.049
I need to get to the bottom
of whatever's been going on

01:09:42.082 --> 01:09:44.517
for the last few days,
which means that both of you--

01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:46.854
What did you tell him, Paulie?

01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:49.023
If you told him anything,
I will end your career

01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:50.358
before it starts.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.326
Threats are not productive
right now, professor.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.394
Productive.

01:09:53.426 --> 01:09:56.364
This young man kidnapped my--
my--

01:09:56.397 --> 01:09:57.231
Brother.

01:09:57.264 --> 01:09:58.199
Exactly.

01:09:58.232 --> 01:09:59.900
That's what I said.
He kidnapped my brother.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:02.103
You were wrong!

01:10:02.136 --> 01:10:04.071
You were totally wrong.

01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:06.506
You said that Chuck was ready to
take on the real world,

01:10:06.539 --> 01:10:07.908
but he wasn't.

01:10:07.942 --> 01:10:09.243
It doesn't matter how smart
he was,

01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:10.643
because he wasn't designed
to live.

01:10:10.677 --> 01:10:12.579
He was designed to be flawless.

01:10:12.612 --> 01:10:14.547
I know, that's the problem.

01:10:14.581 --> 01:10:15.682
SHERIFF ANDERSON:
Enough.

01:10:18.486 --> 01:10:21.422
I've had it up to here
with the yelling and the lies.

01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:23.491
No more lies.

01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:26.693
You said wasn't.

01:10:26.726 --> 01:10:28.262
He wasn't ready.

01:10:28.295 --> 01:10:30.998
What did you mean by wasn't?

01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:37.537
If anything happened to Chuck,
Paulie,

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:39.639
I will make sure that
you are blackballed

01:10:39.672 --> 01:10:41.409
from every top university.

01:10:41.442 --> 01:10:42.510
I don't care.

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.345
Then why did you come looking
for me?

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:47.148
Because I wanted you to like me!

01:10:50.518 --> 01:10:52.987
I don't have any friends
at home, and I--

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.554
I always thought it was,
because the other kids

01:10:54.587 --> 01:10:57.158
weren't smart enough
to be my friends.

01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:59.592
I thought if anyone
would understand me,

01:10:59.626 --> 01:11:01.095
it would be you.

01:11:01.128 --> 01:11:03.464
You fit the equation in my head.

01:11:07.968 --> 01:11:10.271
I need to go find Avery.

01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:16.377
What are you doing?

01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:19.579
I know about the robot.

01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:23.616
I'm sorry, I don't--
I don't know why you'd

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:25.953
say something like that.

01:11:25.986 --> 01:11:27.855
I saw his parts
all over the road.

01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:28.889
What?

01:11:28.923 --> 01:11:31.724
Not all of his parts.

01:11:31.758 --> 01:11:33.394
Look, uh--

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.299
(Prof. Shikenjanski gasps)

01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:13.968
Mom, hi.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:14.869
Sorry.

01:12:14.902 --> 01:12:16.237
Sorry, I didn't call you back.

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:19.573
Oh, I can't talk right now,
'cause I'm on a jet ski.

01:12:19.607 --> 01:12:20.441
A jet ski, yeah.

01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:21.842
Yeah, okay, I'll call you
right back

01:12:21.876 --> 01:12:23.511
after I find my friend.

01:12:23.544 --> 01:12:23.944
I love you.

01:12:23.978 --> 01:12:24.979
Bye.

01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:07.922
PAULIE:
Hey.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.859
Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:19.066
Whose jet ski is that?

01:13:19.099 --> 01:13:21.268
I think it's your neighbor's.

01:13:21.302 --> 01:13:23.304
You stole it?

01:13:27.474 --> 01:13:29.443
PAULIE:
I needed to find you.

01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:33.013
Why?

01:13:35.316 --> 01:13:37.484
I don't know.

01:13:38.052 --> 01:13:40.955
I mean...

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.690
I'm sorry.

01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:45.559
I'm really sorry,

01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:46.759
I should never have told
your dad that

01:13:46.793 --> 01:13:49.396
you got knocked up, impregnated.

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.669
It's okay.

01:13:57.238 --> 01:13:59.506
He was gonna find out
at some point.

01:14:02.876 --> 01:14:05.479
I just--

01:14:05.512 --> 01:14:07.581
I really want to be your friend.

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:13.721
I've never had a friend
like you before.

01:14:18.425 --> 01:14:20.427
Paulie.

01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:25.798
Come here.

01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:27.434
Okay.

01:14:29.236 --> 01:14:32.673
God, it's huge.

01:14:35.843 --> 01:14:38.778
(Grunting)

01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:44.318
Careful.

01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:45.919
Sorry.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.655
What should I do?

01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:50.924
Woah!

01:14:54.862 --> 01:14:56.230
Alright, Paulie, hold it steady.

01:14:56.263 --> 01:14:56.964
Oh, okay.

01:14:56.997 --> 01:14:58.132
I'll get the net.

01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:03.370

01:15:14.915 --> 01:15:15.849
(Laughing)

01:15:15.883 --> 01:15:17.017
We did it!

01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:23.057
PAULIE:
It's a real muskie, right?

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:25.159
The fish of 10,000 casts.

01:15:25.192 --> 01:15:26.860
Oh yeah.

01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:28.295
What should we do now?

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.802
You let it go.

01:15:37.004 --> 01:15:39.840
Shouldn't we take
a picture first?

01:15:39.873 --> 01:15:42.443
No, we'll remember we caught it.

01:15:42.476 --> 01:15:44.111
Of course,
we're gonna take a picture.

01:15:44.144 --> 01:15:46.880
People make their whole life
for a fish like this.

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:49.516
(Laughs)

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.051
Oh my...

01:15:51.085 --> 01:16:00.027
(♪♪♪)

01:16:13.808 --> 01:16:15.943
How come Minnesota has
so many lakes?

01:16:15.976 --> 01:16:19.113
Paul Bunyan
and Babe the Blue Ox?

01:16:19.146 --> 01:16:22.516
Legend has it that Paul and Babe
were so big,

01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:24.385
each of their footprints
formed a new lake

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:26.120
as they wrestled
around the state.

01:16:26.153 --> 01:16:27.554
That's ridiculous.

01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:29.223
Yeah, but it's fun
to think about

01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:30.290
when you're a kid.

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:31.892
You know there are ways
to make the actual science

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:33.227
fun to think about, too.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.562
I'm sure there are.

01:16:35.596 --> 01:16:37.765
There's actually a Paul Bunyan
theme park

01:16:37.798 --> 01:16:39.266
that's not too far from here.

01:16:39.299 --> 01:16:41.135
Could take you there
before you drive back.

01:16:41.168 --> 01:16:42.536
Sure.

01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:44.304
If we survive this.

01:16:54.982 --> 01:16:56.417
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
Sit.

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.259
I watched your videos.

01:17:05.592 --> 01:17:06.994
What?

01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:08.796
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
You're fishing videos.

01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:12.366
Your outburst about Chuck
and the tiger muskies

01:17:12.399 --> 01:17:14.301
caught me off guard.

01:17:14.334 --> 01:17:18.105
And I was angry,
so I didn't consider the merits

01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:20.374
of the argument until after.

01:17:21.843 --> 01:17:23.010
Which channel did you?

01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:24.978
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
I found them all.

01:17:25.012 --> 01:17:27.381
And now, I'm curious.

01:17:28.348 --> 01:17:30.350
Why do you make them?

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.856
She's a great teacher.

01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:36.723
She really connects
with her viewers.

01:17:36.757 --> 01:17:38.860
No, I don't.

01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:42.529
Those connections aren't real.

01:17:42.563 --> 01:17:44.998
My audience doesn't know me.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.571
It's all a bullshit substitute
for actual relationships.

01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:54.341
I get it.

01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:58.979
Professor,
I'm sorry about Chuck.

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.181
I had no right to take him.

01:18:05.385 --> 01:18:07.354
Chuck?

01:18:07.387 --> 01:18:09.690
Did Paulie kidnap you?

01:18:09.723 --> 01:18:13.694
Paulie invited me to accompany
him and Beyoncé in the truck,

01:18:13.727 --> 01:18:15.229
I chose to go.

01:18:17.932 --> 01:18:19.733
Where is he?

01:18:19.766 --> 01:18:21.668
Online.

01:18:22.803 --> 01:18:24.271
PROF. SHIKENJANSKI:
Come on.

01:18:30.879 --> 01:18:33.046
(Sighs)

01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:38.452
Our little episode has made me
realise that

01:18:38.485 --> 01:18:41.054
I need to spend more time
on campus.

01:18:41.088 --> 01:18:43.624
Isolation is limiting
my scientific ceiling.

01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:49.396
Ultimately, I will let the world
know who Chuck is

01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:52.432
and that he was invented
by someone who looks like me.

01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:55.769
But not until I'm ready.

01:18:57.638 --> 01:19:00.407
This says that you promise
not to expose my identity

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.610
or share any aspects of my work
without my permission.

01:19:03.644 --> 01:19:06.780
And in return,
I will sponsor your admission

01:19:06.814 --> 01:19:08.549
to the university
of your choosing.

01:19:11.151 --> 01:19:13.487
