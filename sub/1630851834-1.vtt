WEBVTT

02:56.093 --> 02:58.387
So after breakfast, Teddy,
I'm gonna tidy up,

02:59.429 --> 03:01.557
and then I'm gonna do
a little bit of work.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.185
And then your cousin Ellie
is gonna come over.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.271
Can you say "Ellie"?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.939
Ellie.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.816
Okay.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.904
What do you think the next book
should be about, Champy?

03:16.780 --> 03:17.865
You like that color.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.910
Pinky Tinkerbink unlocks her courage.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.621
You like that idea?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.674
Mama's not good with circles.
No, she's not.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.761
<i>You're gonna love peaches, Teddy.</i>

03:41.013 --> 03:43.765
Your dad loves peaches,
but he's allergic to the skin.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.101
Hopefully, you won't be allergic.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.604
And if you are,
I'll just peel the skins off for you.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.564
Okay. It'll be easy.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.149
Hey, guys.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.777
-Morning.
-Hi, babe.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.531
-Got something to show me?
-Yes, I have something to show you.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.450
Great. Hey, buddy.

04:02.034 --> 04:02.868
Okay.

04:02.951 --> 04:08.123
Okay, so from my reading
they asked me to design a poster, right,

04:08.624 --> 04:10.918
and then I designed the whole window.

04:11.001 --> 04:11.835
Of course you did.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.630
Pinky's in the middle of this big rainbow,
and it's super bright,

04:14.713 --> 04:17.716
and she's throwing up
all these 3D hearts up in the air.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.094
And then, look.
Every kid gets to leave with one of these.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.638
A magic pinkie ring.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.436
-You're not even listening to me.
-Yes, I am. I'm always listening.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.731
No, you're giving me
that look that you give me.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.734
I'm looking in your eyes.
She has nice eyes.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.445
Your mom has very nice eyes.
Just like yours.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.864
I just don't know
what you're trying to find.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.243
You.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.287
I'm right here.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.626
Crap.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.337
Okay. I gotta go.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.798
Gotta go. Bye, buddy. Love you.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.132
Bye, Mommy.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.094
Okay, okay.

05:02.177 --> 05:06.056
I'll meet you on the corner outside,
34th and 7th, 7 p.m.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.809
Please don't be too late.
Because I really wanna see this game.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.852
Who's that?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.188
-Hola, Teddy.
<i>-Buenos dÃ­as,</i> Hector.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.982
-Hector, can I ride down with you?
-Sure.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.234
-Bye.
-We love you.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.903
Bye, dada.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.992
Those feets in?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.535
Got those feets in?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.370
Okay.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.872
Does it feel good?

05:30.372 --> 05:31.915
Does that feel good, Teddy?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.042
Good boy.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.503
That feels nice, doesn't it?

05:36.587 --> 05:38.630
Yeah, that's very warm.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.132
That's very warm.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.263
Baby.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.275
<i>You know you're gonna walk soon?</i>

05:59.860 --> 06:04.072
When you start walking,
you're gonna trip and skin your knee.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.034
You're gonna bop your head
on the coffee table,

06:07.534 --> 06:08.744
but you're gonna keep going.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.748
Because that's what champions do.
Right, Champy?

06:14.249 --> 06:15.250
They keep going.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.005
Who's a good boy?

06:22.591 --> 06:24.051
See all those flowers?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.136
<i>Pretty flowers.</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:25.988
Yeah.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.931
<i>Look at that moon.</i>

07:53.765 --> 07:54.600
<i>That's pretty.</i>

07:55.601 --> 07:57.769
<i>You ever think
you might like to visit the moon?</i>

07:58.604 --> 07:59.563
<i>Well, I did.</i>

08:08.280 --> 08:11.867
<i>Well, I'd like to visit the moon</i>

08:11.950 --> 08:15.829
<i>On a rocket ship high in the air</i>

08:16.371 --> 08:19.666
<i>Yes, I'd like to visit the moon</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:24.087
<i>But I don't think I'd like to live there</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:28.383
<i>Though I'd like to look down at the Earth
From above</i>

08:28.467 --> 08:31.261
<i>-Machine.
-Julie, pick up. We know you're there.</i>

08:32.763 --> 08:34.556
<i>We just parked. Need anything?</i>

08:38.101 --> 08:39.186
<i>Starbucks?</i>

08:40.229 --> 08:43.023
<i>Ellie stop pulling my hair,
you're gonna pull all my hair out.</i>

08:43.524 --> 08:45.692
<i>We'll be there in ten minutes, okay? Bye.</i>

08:45.776 --> 08:48.320
<i>I could meet all the fish everywhere</i>

08:49.071 --> 08:52.491
<i>Yes, I'd travel under the sea</i>

08:53.075 --> 08:56.203
<i>But I don't think I'd like to live there</i>

08:58.247 --> 08:59.665
Ellie will be here soon.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.504
<i>But there's not much to do
When your friends are all fish</i>

09:05.587 --> 09:09.550
<i>And an oyster and clam aren't real family</i>

09:09.633 --> 09:13.011
<i>So I don't want to live in the sea</i>

09:13.554 --> 09:17.891
<i>I'd like to visit the jungle
Hear the lion roar</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:22.229
<i>Go back in time and meet a dinosaur</i>

09:22.312 --> 09:25.941
<i>There's so many strange places
I'd like to be</i>

09:26.441 --> 09:29.945
<i>But none of them permanently</i>

09:30.028 --> 09:33.657
<i>So if I should visit the moon</i>

09:34.408 --> 09:38.120
<i>Well, I'll dance on a moonbeam and then</i>

09:38.662 --> 09:41.540
<i>I will make a wish on a star</i>

09:42.749 --> 09:46.378
<i>And I'll wish I was home once again</i>

09:46.962 --> 09:50.966
<i>Though I'd like to look down
At the Earth from above</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:55.012
<i>I would miss all the places
And the people I love</i>

09:55.095 --> 10:00.434
<i>So although I may go
I'll be coming home soon</i>

10:01.518 --> 10:05.856
<i>'Cause I don't want to live on the moon</i>

10:05.939 --> 10:09.526
<i>No, I don't want to live</i>

10:10.277 --> 10:11.945
<i>On the moon</i>

11:11.171 --> 11:13.382
What are you looking at?
Do you see your balloon?

11:14.216 --> 11:16.343
Do you see that balloon? That's for you.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.655
Almost home, Champy. We're almost there.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.038
Okay.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.791
So, okay.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.086
Hi, guys.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.589
-Hey.
-How's my favorite grandson?

11:57.176 --> 11:58.051
Here we go.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.389
-Are you ready for a bottle?
-Hi. Hi.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.767
Come here, baby, come here.
I got you. I got you.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.395
Who's a beautiful boy?

12:08.478 --> 12:11.481
Hey. Hey there. Hey.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.401
I got it.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.237
-Hello?
-<i>Hey.</i>

12:17.321 --> 12:18.155
Hi.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.698
-How are things?
-<i>Great.</i>

12:19.781 --> 12:21.450
<i>We just got back from the shoe store.</i>

12:21.533 --> 12:26.538
And our little guy with those
chubby little feet is a size four.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.040
Walker. Wide.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.750
Listen.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.836
I won't be late tonight.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.964
I'll meet those guys after work
and come home at halftime. Okay?

12:36.048 --> 12:39.301
I wanna go tonight with you, actually.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.931
I mean, my mom did the laundry
and puffed the pillows

12:44.014 --> 12:46.099
and she's giving Teddy his bottle
as we speak,

12:46.183 --> 12:48.602
so I feel like,
since you have her standing guard,

12:48.685 --> 12:50.312
we should take advantage of it.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.856
Jule, it's just temporary, you know?

12:52.940 --> 12:55.484
Until you're strong enough
to take care of Teddy on your own.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.653
Oh, shit, so like forever?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.280
<i>Are you sure you're ready to see Lucy?</i>

13:00.822 --> 13:02.950
Yeah. Yeah. I want to.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.576
I need to go.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.245
Okay.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.790
<i>-I'll meet you outside.
</i>-Okay, I'll see you soon.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.084
Love you.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.127
I love you. Bye.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.492
I'm having my face done.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.745
No, you're not. That's ridiculous, Mom.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.582
There was an opening on Teddy's birthday.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.375
Luckiest day of the year.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.130
But then I thought
you might need me for his party.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.673
Party? What party?

13:59.756 --> 14:02.426
He doesn't have any friends.
Who would we invite?

14:02.509 --> 14:05.179
But you do.
Come on, it will be a good reset.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.140
Have people over,
let everyone know you're okay.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.896
And it would make it easy
for your dad to come back.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.819
You know he loves you very much.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.783
Mom, I love you, but you have to stop
standing outside of the shower.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.114
Hello, Ms. Davis.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.200
I'm Dr. Sylvester.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.411
-I'm a psychiatrist here in the hospital.
-Is my son okay?

15:11.912 --> 15:14.289
Yes, he's absolutely fine.

15:14.998 --> 15:18.544
Cute little guy. He's waiting
with your husband at your home.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.712
My sister-in-law, she's gonna kill me.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.256
No, no, no.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.258
They very much wanna see you,

15:24.341 --> 15:27.469
but I thought it might be a good idea
if we had a chance to talk first.

15:28.387 --> 15:29.513
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.514
Okay.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.432
Can you tell me what happened?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.565
Is this the first time
you've tried to take your life?

15:40.357 --> 15:41.275
Yeah.

15:42.276 --> 15:45.612
Have you come close before?
Thought about it before?

15:48.699 --> 15:50.492
I think about it all the time.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.829
How far back does that go?

15:57.541 --> 16:00.294
On and off since I was in the first grade.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.631
That's when things started changing.

16:05.924 --> 16:06.842
In what way?

16:08.260 --> 16:09.553
Things were fuzzy.

16:10.804 --> 16:14.766
Memory's fuzzy.
I don't know how else to explain it.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.312
-Does mental illness run in your family?
-No.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.898
That's not true.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.860
My mom would say
that my dad's mentally ill.

16:26.612 --> 16:27.988
My husband would say that

16:29.281 --> 16:33.535
my dad's mental illness
looks a lot like being an asshole.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.498
What about more recently?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.543
How did you do when you were pregnant?

16:42.544 --> 16:43.670
I managed.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.840
How about after you had the baby?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.426
There was just more or less,

16:49.968 --> 16:53.096
the same thing I'd been experiencing
most of my life.

16:54.598 --> 16:58.519
Felt spoiled and too weak.

16:59.228 --> 17:05.275
Like every other woman would do
a better job of taking care of Teddy.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.194
Both of them.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.755
You may or may not remember this,
but in the 1970s,

17:26.839 --> 17:29.800
there were rumors
that there were spider eggs in this stuff.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.760
And people just stopped chewing it.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.347
For a while,
I actually thought that was true.

17:36.265 --> 17:39.142
Even after they took out an ad
in the <i>New York Times</i>

17:39.226 --> 17:41.645
and I knew it wasn't true,
I still couldn't chew it.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.317
It's funny how that happens.
A rumor starts, you believe it,

17:48.151 --> 17:52.990
and you find out it's not true, and still
you can't put the damn gum in your mouth.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.659
And then just the other day,

17:55.742 --> 17:59.246
I'm in the drug store with my daughter,
and I tell her to pick some candy.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.207
Wouldn't you know, she just grabs this.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.459
You know, it's pink, it's eye level. Sure.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.214
But then, suddenly,
my thought process goes like this:

18:09.298 --> 18:12.092
"Wait a minute,
she's still too young for gum.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.218
She's gonna choke."

18:13.927 --> 18:18.140
And then I think, "You're a medical man.
You know she won't choke. That's crazy."

18:19.057 --> 18:20.100
And it hit me.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.273
It was my irrational fear of spider eggs.

18:28.859 --> 18:30.402
After all these years.

18:34.114 --> 18:38.619
I guess we all need to learn
where the spider eggs actually are.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.499
And perhaps more importantly,
where they are not.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.140
Who's a hungry boy?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.059
Oh, such a good eater.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.519
There you go.

19:03.602 --> 19:06.021
-What a good boy you are.
-Mom, can you wrap me? Please.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.106
Sure.

19:08.774 --> 19:09.942
Can't get this one.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.611
I need to cut your hair, buddy.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.615
-We can take him to a barber shop.
-You afraid of me with scissors?

19:17.115 --> 19:19.243
No, I'm scared he's gonna look ugly.

19:20.244 --> 19:21.620
-Not gonna look ugly.
-There.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.206
That's good. Covers up everything.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.793
All it took
were just a couple strands of beads.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.586
Hey, bubs. Hi.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.005
-Oh, look at this.
-Sweet boy.

19:32.089 --> 19:32.923
Look at this.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.591
Oh, God.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.886
It's what my face is gonna look like.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.389
And they're gonna shave the cartilage.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.475
I mean, everyone's nose
gets more bulbous as they age.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.185
And their teeth shift.

19:45.269 --> 19:49.815
One day, if I'm not here, I want you
to watch your nose and your teeth.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.817
Dead giveaways. You know?

19:54.486 --> 19:55.654
You wanna feed him?

19:58.282 --> 20:00.868
It's okay, different time.
A different time.

20:00.951 --> 20:03.203
-You don't wanna be late.
-Yeah.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.831
You go have fun with your husband.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.042
Don't you worry. I'm here.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.170
Yeah, you can have another bite.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.718
-Yeah.
-Sorry. You're beautiful, Mom.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.803
No face-lifts, okay?

20:19.887 --> 20:22.181
You'll look like an alien.
I love you so much.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.100
-I'll look ten years younger.
-I love you, I love you, I love you.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.060
Have fun. Have fun.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.563
Okay, I'm going.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.480
Hey, Jule.

20:32.065 --> 20:32.941
Yeah?

20:33.025 --> 20:34.526
You think he's okay, right?

20:34.610 --> 20:38.197
I mean, you don't think
anything has happened to him, do you?

20:38.280 --> 20:40.115
Dad? No, I'm not worried about him.

20:40.199 --> 20:44.494
Because I've always been able
to reach him. I can't reach him.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.000
Maybe he doesn't wanna be found.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.839
-Would you like another bite?
-I love you.

20:56.465 --> 21:00.344
<i>If you kiss a ukulele lady</i>

21:00.427 --> 21:03.555
<i>And you promise ever to be true</i>

21:03.639 --> 21:04.932
I'm locking the door.

21:05.015 --> 21:10.229
<i>If she sees another ukulele lady
Mess around on you</i>

21:11.688 --> 21:15.651
<i>Maybe she'll cry</i>

21:15.734 --> 21:18.946
<i>Maybe she'll sigh</i>

21:19.446 --> 21:21.740
<i>Maybe she'll find...</i>

21:53.230 --> 21:56.567
Jesus. Just hold on. Hold on.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.256
You made it.

22:22.843 --> 22:23.677
You all right?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.387
Yeah, I got this.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.015
-You got this?
-Yeah.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.649
-Hey.
-Hey, look at you.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.026
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.611
Hey, buddy, good to see you.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.864
So what do you think?
Our guy's gonna pull through, huh?

22:43.947 --> 22:47.075
-Mortal lock.
-Listen to your fucking husband, huh?

22:47.159 --> 22:50.287
-The eternal fucking optimist.
-You don't have to tell me.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.831
Come on, let's sit. Lucy's here.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.381
-Hey, sis.
-Hey.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.594
All right, so drinks. Want drinks?

23:05.677 --> 23:06.929
-Yes.
-Beers, huh?

23:07.012 --> 23:10.766
-What are we having?
-Hi. Can I get four Coronas with lime?

23:10.849 --> 23:13.435
You want--? Extra lime. Thanks.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.853
-You got it.
-Yeah.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.355
-Sure.
-Sounds good.

23:16.855 --> 23:17.689
Yeah.

23:18.899 --> 23:20.526
I got apps, all right?

23:20.609 --> 23:24.947
I already got some-- Got those
little teeny-tiny hot dogs and nachos.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.158
-All right. Yum.
-Thank you.

23:28.242 --> 23:29.201
Yummy, yummy.

23:31.870 --> 23:32.704
Thanks.

23:34.873 --> 23:38.377
You guys know who Shel Silverstein is?
He's the guy that wrote <i>The Giving Tree.</i>

23:38.460 --> 23:40.963
-Sure.
-Yeah. He's, like, one of my heroes.

23:41.046 --> 23:45.050
I mean, there's like Schulz, Seuss,
Sendak, Hans Christian Anderson.

23:45.133 --> 23:48.887
But that's besides the point.
Anyway, he-- Before he was famous,

23:48.971 --> 23:51.139
he sold hot dogs
for the White Sox and Chicago Cubs.

23:51.223 --> 23:54.393
You know what that's like? That's like
working for the Mets and the Yankees.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.979
Yeah. And then when he was famous,

23:57.062 --> 24:01.608
an interviewer asked him
what he learned, and they--

24:01.692 --> 24:04.736
He said that everybody likes ketchup.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.113
Everybody likes mustard.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.240
Everybody likes mustard.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.661
Yeah. That was it.
That was what he learned.

24:13.662 --> 24:14.496
Mustard.

24:15.289 --> 24:17.207
Are you done with that story?

24:17.291 --> 24:19.293
Mind if I change the subject
really quickly?

24:21.044 --> 24:22.504
-I'm just wondering--
-Stop.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.757
Go ahead. Let her say
what she wants to say.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.469
Did you ever think about
what it would be like for us?

24:29.553 --> 24:32.014
Ellie thought
she was coming over for a play date.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.932
-Okay, stop.
-Okay.

24:35.309 --> 24:37.686
Oh, how was the house?

24:37.769 --> 24:39.563
Did you like the house? It's nice, right?

24:40.731 --> 24:41.857
-No.
-What?

24:42.441 --> 24:43.817
What?

24:44.693 --> 24:48.155
I went up and saw a house that's for sale,
down the street from them.

24:48.238 --> 24:49.823
It's really nice. There's a big yard.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.450
Very affordable.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.784
There's a basketball hoop.

24:52.868 --> 24:55.829
You can watch Teddy play
from the kitchen window.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.331
Houses scare me.

24:57.414 --> 25:00.626
And I love our apartment. I'm happy there.

25:00.709 --> 25:03.879
-I'm really happy there.
-Now I'm lost. I'm sorry.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.423
-Okay.
-You say that you're happy there?

25:06.507 --> 25:09.384
-Okay, guys.
-I'm so confused. I'm very confused.

25:09.468 --> 25:13.680
I'm sorry, it's just, it's always--
It's always about you, Julie.

25:13.764 --> 25:15.182
It's never about him.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.768
Have you ever even asked him
what it was like for him?

25:18.268 --> 25:21.480
Ask him, ask him what he did every night
while you were in the hospital.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.856
Tell her what you did.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.567
I think a move might be good for us,
that's all.

25:25.651 --> 25:28.946
He would come home after work,
after visiting you in the hospital,

25:29.029 --> 25:32.074
after putting your son to bed,
and you know what he would do?

25:32.157 --> 25:33.492
He would scrub the carpet.

25:35.244 --> 25:38.288
That's the thing about blood.
Your blood won't come out of the carpet.

25:38.372 --> 25:39.748
-Where you going?
-I have to pee.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.383
-Are you happy?
-Really? Really, Luce?

25:51.343 --> 25:52.261
Let me.

27:55.801 --> 27:56.635
Jule?

28:44.558 --> 28:46.351
<i>Yeah! You ready?</i>

28:49.479 --> 28:51.064
<i>-That looks insane, man.
-Ready?</i>

28:51.982 --> 28:54.651
<i>One, two...</i>

29:24.181 --> 29:25.432
<i>Hey, this is Ron.</i>

29:25.516 --> 29:27.559
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you as--</i>

30:12.980 --> 30:14.731
Why are you scared of houses?

30:16.525 --> 30:18.986
Houses are great. Everyone loves houses.

30:24.116 --> 30:27.077
Let's say that you're on one end
of the house and I'm on the other end,

30:27.160 --> 30:29.830
and I call your name
and you don't hear me. Then what?

30:31.707 --> 30:33.125
We get walkie-talkies?

30:33.625 --> 30:36.336
What if there's a thunderstorm
and you're in the city,

30:36.420 --> 30:38.046
and Teddy and I are alone out there?

30:39.006 --> 30:39.965
I drive home.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.342
And what if you crash?

30:44.261 --> 30:49.141
Then I limp to a train
and walk the rest of the way.

30:51.018 --> 30:53.478
What if we move up there
and you stop loving me?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.274
Well...

30:58.817 --> 31:01.195
I mean,
you can't really blame the house for that.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.201
Jule.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.579
I'm never gonna stop loving you.

31:15.417 --> 31:18.712
How about this? I promise
to go to the roof of our house

31:19.338 --> 31:21.131
and sneak cigarettes with you.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.688
I mean,
you would get to see the stars again.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.128
They're getting better.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.475
Look at that.

32:57.269 --> 33:01.440
I have a birthday boy
who's very excited to see his mommy.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.692
-Happy birthday, my love.
-Yeah.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.777
Hi, Champy.

33:05.861 --> 33:07.362
Happy birthday.

33:07.863 --> 33:08.822
Do you like your sign?

33:08.906 --> 33:13.994
It says, "Happy birthday, Teddy Bear."
Mama made that sign.

33:14.494 --> 33:17.289
She just finished it.
You wanna see what I got you?

33:17.372 --> 33:19.082
-Want some presents?
-Do you want to see?

33:20.042 --> 33:22.294
-Okay.
-All right. So, what do we got here?

33:22.377 --> 33:23.545
What is this?

33:24.963 --> 33:26.381
Homemade surprise?

33:32.221 --> 33:33.847
-Too much?
-No.

33:34.973 --> 33:36.808
-He likes it.
-He likes it.

33:38.936 --> 33:39.811
Yeah?

33:41.563 --> 33:42.523
Very cute.

33:45.234 --> 33:47.236
-It's not my birthday.
-Open it.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.915
The next Pinky book is about hope.

34:08.590 --> 34:09.550
Thank you.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.137
We made it to one.

34:19.851 --> 34:20.936
What do you think?

34:22.646 --> 34:25.023
We made it to one.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.234
Sorry I'm so hairy.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.863
I see 50 of these a day.

35:13.822 --> 35:17.201
It would have to snap like a turtle
for me to notice.

35:18.619 --> 35:19.828
Okay.

35:21.038 --> 35:21.914
All done.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.373
Why don't you sit up.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.838
-It's Teddy's birthday. Today. Yeah.
-Doing anything to celebrate?

35:29.922 --> 35:32.299
He's gonna have
his first chocolate cake tonight.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.718
-I'm gonna bake it for him.
-Amazing.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.387
I have to tell you,
I'm asking new mothers

35:37.471 --> 35:40.390
how they're feeling when they come in.
Not just physically, but really

35:40.474 --> 35:41.308
how they're doing.

35:42.434 --> 35:43.435
That's because of you.

35:44.561 --> 35:45.729
That's really good.

35:50.067 --> 35:51.902
How are the antidepressants
working for you?

35:52.611 --> 35:53.904
Good, you know?

35:53.987 --> 35:58.283
I was walking through a world
that was black-and-white,

35:58.367 --> 36:01.328
and now I'm just starting
to see color again, so...

36:02.996 --> 36:05.123
-Good.
-Yeah.

36:05.707 --> 36:08.585
And how are your periods?
They still obliterating you?

36:08.669 --> 36:10.462
You know the silver lining here?

36:11.213 --> 36:13.006
I hate to say
that I haven't got my period,

36:13.090 --> 36:14.883
and it's been like two months.

36:15.592 --> 36:17.845
All the blood loss maybe.

36:19.805 --> 36:20.639
Makes sense.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.184
Okay. Good.
I'm gonna have Barbara take some blood,

36:24.268 --> 36:26.019
have you pee in a cup.
You know the drill.

36:26.103 --> 36:27.145
Okay.

36:27.229 --> 36:28.605
And I'll be back in a minute.

36:32.025 --> 36:32.860
Okay.

36:53.422 --> 36:54.256
When?

36:57.885 --> 36:58.719
October.

37:03.932 --> 37:05.434
October is soon.

37:10.814 --> 37:12.316
Some bread crumbs.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.568
Good, good. Okay.

37:15.861 --> 37:16.695
Yeah.

37:18.989 --> 37:21.116
Didn't know there were
so many bread crumbs.

37:25.704 --> 37:27.706
Isn't that the same thing? Same thing.

37:29.041 --> 37:29.875
Okay.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.003
I'll just get these.
No, I'll get these. Okay.

37:33.086 --> 37:34.630
<i>And vanilla extract,</i>

37:35.130 --> 37:37.966
and then we have soda water,
and then we're done.

37:43.597 --> 37:45.557
I gotta get some water for Daddy.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.684
He loves fizzy water.

37:47.768 --> 37:49.144
You can help me out.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.981
There's a lot of options here.

37:55.317 --> 37:57.361
It's not that hard. Okay.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.660
<i>The store will be closing shortly.</i>

38:09.540 --> 38:12.167
Oh, this isn't that hard.
It's not that hard.

38:16.213 --> 38:17.339
Ma'am?

38:18.507 --> 38:19.383
Ma'am.

38:20.342 --> 38:21.176
Ma'am.

38:22.970 --> 38:24.471
Ma'am, you haven't paid yet.

38:25.889 --> 38:26.932
Ma'am, you have to pay.

38:28.892 --> 38:30.018
Let go of the lemon, baby.

38:30.102 --> 38:31.562
Come on. Good boy.

38:32.104 --> 38:33.438
Teddy, we didn't pay for that.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.352
Hey.

39:36.001 --> 39:40.714
Here to see Dr. Sylvester.
It's Julie Davis. I'm Ethan Davis.

39:41.757 --> 39:44.468
I understand what you're saying,
but I just can't do it.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.346
I didn't have a glass of wine
or a Diet Coke

39:47.429 --> 39:50.140
when I was pregnant with Teddy.
Didn't have coffee or cigarettes.

39:50.224 --> 39:52.434
If you were diabetic,
would you stop taking medicine?

39:52.518 --> 39:54.811
That's not the same thing.

39:57.189 --> 40:00.526
This feels like a conversation, guys,
but it isn't.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.237
Okay? You have to stay
on the antidepressant.

40:04.571 --> 40:05.781
You can go off the drug,

40:05.864 --> 40:08.367
and your pregnancy hormones
might protect you.

40:08.450 --> 40:11.036
But after,
when you go back on, it might not work.

40:11.119 --> 40:12.788
Or it might take too long to work.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.582
That's not a risk to take. Is it?

40:17.459 --> 40:19.503
Now, I know you're a very strong woman.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.296
I know you want that to be enough.

40:21.380 --> 40:26.343
But you can be
as strong as Hercules himself,

40:26.426 --> 40:29.137
and if you fall into a pool
and you don't know how to swim,

40:29.221 --> 40:30.097
you'll drown.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.850
But I know how to swim.

40:34.351 --> 40:37.855
You know, when I was in college,
I fancied myself a poet

40:37.938 --> 40:39.940
because I was dating a poet
in my junior year.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.902
And we used to read poems to each other
every night before bed.

40:43.986 --> 40:46.738
And one night, my lady friend read me

40:47.531 --> 40:48.657
this poem.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.744
It made quite an impression on me.

40:53.537 --> 40:57.791
<i>Your small brother is making
his balloon squeak like a cat.</i>

40:57.875 --> 40:58.709
<i>Seeming to see</i>

40:58.792 --> 41:01.920
<i>a funny pink world he might like to eat
on the other</i> <i>side of it,</i>

41:02.004 --> 41:04.715
<i>he bites, then sits back,</i>

41:04.798 --> 41:06.049
<i>fat jug</i>

41:06.133 --> 41:08.719
<i>contemplating a world clear as water.</i>

41:08.802 --> 41:12.598
<i>A red</i> s <i>hred in his little fist.</i>

41:14.141 --> 41:16.560
I knew
I could spend the rest of my life trying,

41:16.643 --> 41:18.979
I'd never write a line as good as that.

41:19.855 --> 41:22.482
That's one of the last poems
that Sylvia Plath wrote

41:22.566 --> 41:23.775
before taking her life.

41:24.359 --> 41:25.527
I can remember thinking,

41:25.611 --> 41:30.991
How does someone who sees
that much life and hope in a balloon

41:31.074 --> 41:34.786
simply bake her kids cookies
and then stick her head in the oven?"

41:35.370 --> 41:36.705
How is that possible?

41:37.206 --> 41:40.584
Because she knew the beauty
that she was leaving behind,

41:40.667 --> 41:45.005
and yet the pain was so bad
that death became her only option.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.050
Let's wait.

41:49.343 --> 41:50.177
Wait?

41:51.553 --> 41:52.471
Let's wait.

41:52.971 --> 41:57.184
Let's get Teddy out of diapers.
No one will ever judge you for it.

41:58.227 --> 41:59.436
No one will ever even know.

41:59.937 --> 42:00.771
I'll know.

42:02.397 --> 42:04.608
Jule, listen to him.

42:05.484 --> 42:07.152
We got lucky the last time.

42:17.454 --> 42:19.289
You can be mad at me, that's fine.

42:19.373 --> 42:22.793
Oh, I hate when you do that, Ethan.
You give me permission to be mad at you.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.795
I'll be mad at you
if I wanna be mad at you.

42:24.878 --> 42:27.422
-And you can be mad at me too.
-No, I can't.

42:28.298 --> 42:29.800
I'm not allowed to get mad at you.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.969
You left no room for me to get mad at you.

42:32.845 --> 42:34.096
You made sure of that.

42:36.598 --> 42:37.850
Wow, that's not fair.

42:37.933 --> 42:39.184
Fair? Really?

42:39.268 --> 42:40.978
Do you wanna talk about fair?

42:44.189 --> 42:45.274
I didn't think so.

42:54.408 --> 42:55.242
Come on.

42:58.203 --> 42:59.037
Come on.

43:15.721 --> 43:16.555
Okay.

43:18.515 --> 43:19.349
Okay?

43:23.896 --> 43:24.730
Okay.

44:16.573 --> 44:19.576
Hey. A man from the market,
he brought this.

44:21.745 --> 44:22.579
Thanks.

44:25.290 --> 44:26.166
Okay.

44:27.960 --> 44:29.711
It's nice to have you back again.

44:32.798 --> 44:33.799
Hey, Hector.

44:40.556 --> 44:41.473
It's okay.

45:18.177 --> 45:19.303
It's gonna be okay.

45:22.264 --> 45:25.934
We'll have another baby,
and just like with Teddy,

45:26.018 --> 45:28.729
we won't be able to remember
what the world was like without him.

45:31.148 --> 45:32.065
Or her.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.236
It's a good thing.

45:36.987 --> 45:37.821
Yeah.

45:39.198 --> 45:40.240
It's good.

45:41.491 --> 45:42.326
It's good.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.644
<i>And two more.</i>

46:21.365 --> 46:22.282
Hey, buddy.

46:24.034 --> 46:26.119
Oh, boy. Really?

46:28.288 --> 46:29.665
Okay. How's she doing?

46:31.500 --> 46:34.878
Great. I'm gonna head down right now.
I have everything she asked for.

46:35.712 --> 46:36.713
Yup, that too.

46:37.631 --> 46:39.967
Okay. See you soon.
Call me if there's any updates.

46:40.050 --> 46:42.427
Okay. Love you. Bye.

46:43.971 --> 46:44.805
Okay.

47:02.656 --> 47:03.699
Okay.

47:21.508 --> 47:22.384
You like this?

47:24.011 --> 47:24.970
Trees? Yeah.

47:28.015 --> 47:29.183
It'll be quiet.

47:32.144 --> 47:33.187
You'll get used to it.

47:40.694 --> 47:42.696
You think
the people who lived here were happy?

47:47.492 --> 47:48.368
Probably.

47:51.371 --> 47:52.873
Do you think we'll be happy here?

47:55.417 --> 47:56.710
I do, actually.

47:57.711 --> 47:59.671
I think we'll be very happy here.

48:06.178 --> 48:07.012
Me too.

48:08.764 --> 48:09.723
I do too.

48:13.936 --> 48:15.479
The lungs are developing nicely.

48:16.063 --> 48:21.568
Cardiac activity is excellent.
Ten fingers, ten toes, and...

48:23.195 --> 48:27.241
last but not the least--
Come on, you little rascal.

48:28.033 --> 48:29.993
There we go. Yup.

48:31.286 --> 48:32.246
Wanna know the sex?

48:32.746 --> 48:33.580
-Yes.
-No.

48:35.874 --> 48:39.044
How about I write it down
on a piece of paper,

48:39.127 --> 48:41.672
and then you can check it
when you're ready?

48:43.006 --> 48:44.091
Or not.

48:45.801 --> 48:47.427
This is for your scrapbook.

48:50.472 --> 48:52.641
And I will see you in a month.

48:53.267 --> 48:54.309
You're doing great.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.186
She's doing great.

48:56.270 --> 48:58.272
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thank you.

49:04.570 --> 49:07.781
-Ten fingers, ten toes.
-Ten fingers, ten toes.

49:07.865 --> 49:08.824
-Hi there.
-Hi.

49:08.907 --> 49:09.741
Hi.

49:09.825 --> 49:11.952
-Two strawberry.
-Yeah.

49:12.035 --> 49:14.371
-Two strawberry.
-Two strawberry shortcakes coming up.

49:15.581 --> 49:16.498
Thank you.

49:18.292 --> 49:20.043
Two. It's for you. Thank you.

49:23.213 --> 49:24.131
Yes.

49:40.105 --> 49:42.858
-Don't drop her.
-Why would I drop her?

49:58.999 --> 50:03.420
That's right. That's it.
That's my big and strong what?

50:03.921 --> 50:05.631
Powerful legs.

50:05.714 --> 50:08.467
Watch me flex my...

50:08.550 --> 50:12.638
What word are we looking for?
Thank you. Flex my...

50:13.388 --> 50:16.016
Thank you. Flex my... What?

50:16.808 --> 50:19.561
Ready? Hey, come on. Right here.

50:19.645 --> 50:21.021
Hey, look.

50:22.731 --> 50:24.525
What is she doing?

50:30.822 --> 50:34.159
"The world was dark and gray,
and Pinky was scared.

50:35.369 --> 50:37.079
But she was also very brave.

50:37.746 --> 50:41.667
Pinky climbed inch by inch
to the top of the tower.

50:41.750 --> 50:45.796
Stuck her finger into the keyhole,
and then she turned it.

50:45.879 --> 50:48.882
And the bell began to ring and vibrate.

50:48.966 --> 50:50.759
The carousel animals began to spin,

50:50.843 --> 50:54.263
and, suddenly,
a giant rainbow came pouring out.

50:54.346 --> 50:57.850
The sky became blue,
the grass turned green.

50:57.933 --> 51:01.895
Flowers popped up pink,
purple, yellow, and red.

51:02.479 --> 51:04.815
The world was bright with color.

51:05.566 --> 51:07.651
And Pinky wasn't scared anymore."

51:10.863 --> 51:12.948
Raise your hand
if you're scared of the dark.

51:13.031 --> 51:14.533
-Me.
-You're scared of the dark?

51:14.616 --> 51:15.742
-Yep.
-Why?

51:15.826 --> 51:17.661
-Monsters.
-Monsters.

51:17.744 --> 51:18.912
What do you do?

51:18.996 --> 51:22.624
My mommy says
everyone has monsters in their head.

51:22.708 --> 51:24.960
So when my monster comes out at night,

51:25.043 --> 51:29.715
all I need to do
is close my eyes and tell him to go away.

51:31.008 --> 51:32.092
And does it work?

51:32.634 --> 51:34.511
-Sometimes.
-Sometimes.

51:35.095 --> 51:39.057
You know, when I was your age,
I was also very scared of monsters.

51:39.141 --> 51:42.477
Before bed, I would go out to my window
and I would look out at the stars,

51:42.561 --> 51:44.897
and I would pick a star
and I would wish on it.

51:44.980 --> 51:47.441
And what I wished for was a best friend.

51:47.524 --> 51:51.028
I wanted a best friend
to support me and stay by my side.

51:51.111 --> 51:53.238
And I wanted someone to tell secrets to.

51:53.322 --> 51:55.949
Somebody who would help me
slay the monsters.

51:57.409 --> 52:00.746
And it took me a really long time
to find a best friend

52:00.829 --> 52:02.664
because she didn't exist.

52:04.333 --> 52:05.667
I had to dream her up.

52:07.586 --> 52:08.837
And now she's...

52:10.422 --> 52:11.882
She's always by my side.

52:14.009 --> 52:14.968
I have an idea.

52:15.052 --> 52:19.014
How about we all draw
our own monster slayer?

52:19.556 --> 52:20.724
What do you think?

52:25.270 --> 52:28.649
When I was little, I used to think
that an elf lived inside every clock

52:28.732 --> 52:31.235
and it was up to him to keep time moving.

52:32.486 --> 52:34.863
-Really?
-I used to get worried,

52:34.947 --> 52:37.824
"What if he fell asleep?"
so I'd try to stay up as late as I could

52:37.950 --> 52:41.453
to make sure that the elf stayed awake
and time kept moving.

52:42.538 --> 52:45.415
Well, that's a lot of responsibility
for a little elf.

52:45.499 --> 52:46.333
Yeah.

52:47.167 --> 52:48.335
I was a funny kid.

52:52.589 --> 52:53.715
What are we having?

52:55.843 --> 52:57.177
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

52:58.011 --> 52:58.846
Yeah.

52:59.471 --> 53:00.681
You told me not to tell you.

53:01.390 --> 53:05.519
Then tell me if it's a boy,
and then don't tell me if it's a girl.

53:08.564 --> 53:09.398
Okay.

53:16.655 --> 53:18.282
-A girl?
-Yeah.

53:20.534 --> 53:21.952
-A little girl.
-Yeah.

53:23.161 --> 53:25.455
-Hello, little girl.
-A little girl.

53:28.876 --> 53:30.043
We're having a girl.

53:32.921 --> 53:33.755
I can't--

53:34.339 --> 53:35.883
I can't have a daughter.

53:37.342 --> 53:39.553
I can't have a daughter.
What if she doesn't like me?

53:40.262 --> 53:42.598
-She'll love you.
-Maybe she won't like my hair.

53:42.681 --> 53:44.850
-If she doesn't like my hair?
-Gonna love your hair.

53:44.933 --> 53:46.768
My voice.
What if she doesn't like my voice?

53:46.852 --> 53:49.479
What if she scringes at the sound
of my voice? Oh, God.

53:49.563 --> 53:51.982
Julie. Julie, Julie. Deep breaths. Hey.

53:52.065 --> 53:54.151
-I--
-Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

53:54.234 --> 53:56.278
This is beautiful. This is amazing.

53:56.361 --> 53:58.405
Hey, hey, hey.

53:58.488 --> 54:00.282
Julie, Julie, hey. It's okay.

54:00.782 --> 54:03.869
It's okay. Hey.
Look at me. It's gonna be fine.

54:03.952 --> 54:05.621
It's okay. Deep breaths.

54:05.704 --> 54:08.624
Okay? It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

54:09.666 --> 54:10.834
It's gonna be fine.

54:17.674 --> 54:20.052
Tell him.
Tell him what happened in the park today.

54:20.135 --> 54:21.512
-I don't--
-Tell him, Julie.

54:21.595 --> 54:24.056
I think he's making
a bigger deal out of it than it is.

54:24.139 --> 54:28.727
It's all easy for me, right? All I do
all the time is worry, is she okay?

54:29.228 --> 54:32.439
And I have no idea
because she's so good at pretending.

54:32.940 --> 54:35.484
But for a second, I saw today...

54:36.610 --> 54:39.530
She couldn't pretend,
and I know she's not okay.

54:39.613 --> 54:41.823
-She's not okay.
-I'm...

54:42.908 --> 54:46.828
I'm emotional because I'm pregnant,
and I feel like that's pretty normal.

54:46.912 --> 54:49.331
Don't say that. That's-- Don't lie.

54:50.249 --> 54:51.208
I'm sorry?

54:52.042 --> 54:54.711
I'm-- I'm not the liar.

54:56.463 --> 54:58.674
What does that mean? How am I lying?

54:59.216 --> 55:00.342
How am I lying?

55:01.385 --> 55:02.511
Why do you love me?

55:04.179 --> 55:05.138
Why do you love me?

55:06.056 --> 55:06.890
Look at me.

55:08.517 --> 55:11.895
All you ever wanna do
is look at me in my eyes,

55:11.979 --> 55:13.564
and now you look away?

55:14.815 --> 55:16.358
Because it's scary, right?

55:17.025 --> 55:18.694
And I've been telling you.

55:18.777 --> 55:21.321
I've been telling
you were gonna look away. I warned him.

55:21.405 --> 55:26.785
That if he saw me,
if he really saw how ugly I am,

55:27.953 --> 55:30.038
that you would have no choice
but to look away.

55:32.624 --> 55:33.625
And I was right.

55:35.127 --> 55:36.753
So that makes you the liar.

55:42.342 --> 55:45.846
Why don't you try telling him
what happened that day, Julie?

55:52.144 --> 55:53.395
"Bye-bye, trains." Ready?

55:53.478 --> 55:56.565
Ready? On the count of three,
say, "Bye-bye, trains."

55:57.399 --> 56:01.361
<i>Every time I'm alone, I'm afraid
something bad is gonna happen to Teddy.</i>

56:01.445 --> 56:04.531
Now say, "Bye-bye, kitchen."
Bye-bye, kitchen.

56:04.615 --> 56:07.284
<i>Every time I feed him,
I'm afraid he's going to choke to death.</i>

56:07.367 --> 56:09.411
Thank you. Yes.

56:09.494 --> 56:12.080
<i>If I see someone
with a pot of tea or hot water,</i>

56:12.581 --> 56:14.124
<i>I'm afraid it's going to fall on him</i>

56:14.208 --> 56:17.294
<i>and he's gonna get hurt
because I didn't protect him.</i>

56:17.377 --> 56:20.047
All packed up, ready to go?

56:21.673 --> 56:22.716
I need a minute.

56:24.092 --> 56:24.927
Okay.

56:26.011 --> 56:27.262
We'll be downstairs.

56:28.347 --> 56:32.518
<i>Whenever I give him a bath,
I just think, "What if he drowns?</i>

56:34.019 --> 56:38.899
<i>What happens if I look away
for one second and he drowns?"</i>

56:54.331 --> 56:57.084
<i>When I think of him looking up at me</i>

56:57.167 --> 57:02.798
<i>with those brave, trusting eyes,</i>

57:04.466 --> 57:05.634
<i>I keep hearing...</i>

57:07.553 --> 57:08.887
<i>"You're gonna fail.</i>

57:11.139 --> 57:12.641
<i>You can't help but fail."</i>

57:14.685 --> 57:18.021
<i>And the thought of that,
like, failing him...</i>

57:21.942 --> 57:27.114
<i>And then I think, "Well, we all fail.</i>

57:28.156 --> 57:29.408
<i>One way or another.</i>

57:30.784 --> 57:32.452
<i>We're all going to die."</i>

57:35.956 --> 57:38.667
<i>So that morning,
I knew that your sister was coming over</i>

57:38.750 --> 57:41.086
<i>and I thought, "Just do it.</i>

57:42.629 --> 57:44.923
<i>Lucy's coming over.
She'll take care of him.</i>

57:45.007 --> 57:47.968
<i>Just do it now
before you change your mind.</i>

57:50.470 --> 57:52.848
<i>Because he's safer
in the world without you."</i>

59:15.138 --> 59:17.850
Only you would get sunburned
from a happy lamp.

59:19.351 --> 59:20.519
Do you have a minute?

59:21.478 --> 59:22.479
Really, again?

59:22.563 --> 59:23.730
-Please.
-I-- I--

59:23.814 --> 59:26.441
-I have nothing more to add.
-Just one second. Come on.

59:28.694 --> 59:30.237
-Oh, my gosh.
-Okay.

59:31.029 --> 59:34.199
I'm not sure. Gloria Steinem wouldn't
have painted her daughter's room pink.

59:34.283 --> 59:36.285
But Gloria Steinem didn't have kids.

59:36.368 --> 59:39.079
Right, but what if pink
is asking too much of her?

59:39.162 --> 59:42.708
Maybe she'll be a tomboy
and pink makes her feel bad about herself.

59:42.791 --> 59:44.459
Like she's not pink enough.

59:44.543 --> 59:47.421
-I think you'll have ruined her life.
-I'm serious. This is serious.

59:47.504 --> 59:51.633
It's very important. Like--
I don't think I believe in the color pink.

59:52.259 --> 59:54.261
Is that a thing?
Believing in the color pink?

59:54.344 --> 59:56.972
-Ethan.
-I'm taking this very seriously, okay?

59:57.055 --> 59:59.558
Every time we talk about it,
I take it very seriously.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:00.976
It's not that many times.

01:00:01.059 --> 01:00:02.186
It's very many times.

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:05.355
Okay, well, you know what?
I appreciate your patience. I do.

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:07.274
How about this? I have an idea.

01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:12.112
Close your eyes,
reach out and point to a color.

01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.030
Go.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:14.406
Point!

01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:17.117
-Point to one!
-Okay!

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.287
-What is it? Petal pink.
-Petal pink.

01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:22.080
Petal pink.

01:00:22.164 --> 01:00:25.375
Great. I'm gonna get
two gallons of petal pink, okay?

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.544
And if you don't like it,
I'll repaint for you.

01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:28.921
-All right?
-Yes.

01:00:29.922 --> 01:00:31.840
We should get Teddy dressed
and go over there.

01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:35.344
Do I look normal?

01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:42.392
I wouldn't go that far.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:53.028
Show-off.

01:00:54.488 --> 01:00:57.449
Guys, this is so cute. Thank you.

01:00:58.033 --> 01:00:58.909
You're welcome.

01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:04.289
Please don't worry,
Ellie is so good with him.

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:06.041
I know.

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:07.918
I know.

01:01:12.548 --> 01:01:13.632
All right, already.

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:15.300
Thank you. Look at the ball.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:17.761
Okay, iced tea?

01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:19.263
Oh, yes, please.

01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:20.472
No, thank you.

01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:22.015
Why? Nothing bad will happen.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.809
Caffeine might be good for you.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:25.602
-I'm jealous.
-Yeah.

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:30.190
Nick and I aren't having any more,
and there's some great things about that.

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:31.608
No diapers...

01:01:31.692 --> 01:01:34.653
But I miss having a baby.

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:38.448
I miss that feeling of breastfeeding.

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:40.826
Oh, God, I love that.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.452
Do you think you'll breastfeed?

01:01:43.662 --> 01:01:46.748
Is that safe? Is that okay?
Can you breastfeed and everything?

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:48.041
Are you sure?

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:50.460
-No judgment.
-If he--

01:01:50.544 --> 01:01:51.879
No judgment.

01:01:56.592 --> 01:01:58.677
Are you insane, girl? I'm saying...

01:01:59.595 --> 01:02:01.555
-Yes. Absolutely.
-I know that.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:04.641
Teddy!

01:02:04.725 --> 01:02:07.186
Hey, sorry.
I'm sorry, can you be careful?

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:08.729
Come here. Come here.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:09.771
Oh, it's okay.

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:12.065
Hey. You okay?

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:14.276
Yeah. We should go. We should go.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.862
-Okay.
-Come on. Okay.

01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:18.113
Sorry, baby.

01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:20.741
Excuse me, excuse me.
Come on, boy.

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:28.207
I know I'm not okay
and that I need the medicine.

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.251
But I feel like I'm failing her.

01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:34.963
Jule, a lot of people took formula
and they still love their mothers.

01:02:35.464 --> 01:02:36.298
You know?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.176
You're gonna be a great mom,
no matter what.

01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:42.638
Whether you breastfeed her or not, okay?

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:48.727
I don't know how I'm supposed
to make her feel close to me.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.063
I don't know
how I'm supposed to make her feel safe.

01:02:54.525 --> 01:02:58.612
<i>How many prices is she gonna have to pay,
Ethan, for me being her mom?</i>

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.744
<i>Sometimes I close my eyes
and I picture her,</i>

01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:09.581
<i>you know, running through a field
of flowers in a little white dress</i>

01:03:10.624 --> 01:03:16.046
<i>with her arms open and I think,
"That's what I wanna give her." You know?</i>

01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:20.551
<i>I wanna give her the ability to laugh
without fear.</i>

01:03:25.097 --> 01:03:25.931
<i>And then I think,</i>

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.393
<i>"How am I gonna teach her that</i>

01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:32.145
<i>when I don't know how?</i>

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.941
<i>I can't remember what it was like...</i>

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:39.820
<i>to laugh like that.</i>

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.116
Hello, friend. It's been a while.
My goodness.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:22.529
<i>Can you sing me
a bed night song, Daddy?</i>

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:26.033
<i>"Night Flower," right?</i>

01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:28.285
<i>Come here, you.</i>

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:31.914
<i>So I can make a wish?</i>

01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:33.457
<i>Of course you can.</i>

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.293
<i>What did you wish for?</i>

01:04:36.919 --> 01:04:38.879
<i>For you to always love me.</i>

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:42.007
<i>Sweetheart.</i>

01:04:43.091 --> 01:04:45.511
<i>That's something you'll never
have to waste a wish on.</i>

01:04:46.762 --> 01:04:48.180
<i>I'll love you forever.</i>

01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:57.773
Hi, Rosie. Let's get you ready for bed.

01:04:57.856 --> 01:04:58.774
Rosie.

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:02.528
Hi, Rosie.

01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:05.072
<i>So I can make a wish?</i>

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:08.825
<i>Is there a reason that you did that?
Is there a reason that you did that?</i>

01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:11.828
<i>Look at me! You think that hurt?</i>

01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:34.810
Hey.

01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:40.649
You need to eat something.

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:47.906
-Come on.
-He's in bed?

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.241
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:53.579
He's in bed. I made you dinner.

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:56.498
Did all of the stuff.

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.340
Can you just tell me
a little of the story?

01:06:06.216 --> 01:06:07.634
Just whatever you've got.

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:12.431
I mean, I made you a moon picnic here.
Come on, I need a little story.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:13.891
It's my favorite thing.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.310
You made really good pancakes.

01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:18.270
Thanks. I'm pretty proud of it.

01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:22.149
Okay, the story is called
<i>Pinky Tinkerbink Saves the Stars.</i>

01:06:22.649 --> 01:06:23.817
Love that.

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:25.485
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:30.157
Once upon a time,
there was a star monster.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:37.539
And it began plucking the stars
from the sky, one by one.

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:41.710
Every time he grabs one,
he puts it against his chest.

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:48.217
It goes into his body and then they glow
out of his stomach, bright, really bright.

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:55.098
And our heroine, this little girl
called Pinky Tinkerbink...

01:06:55.182 --> 01:06:56.099
Tinkerbink.

01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.685
...is really sad.

01:06:58.769 --> 01:06:59.978
Why is she sad?

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:03.232
Because the star monster
is taking all the stars out of the sky.

01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:06.068
How is she gonna wish on anything?

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:11.073
So she's trying to figure out how
to put all the stars back into the sky.

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:13.116
And she thinks about...

01:07:14.034 --> 01:07:17.246
<i>"Okay, well,
light bulbs glow like the stars, right?"</i>

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.374
So she unscrews
all the light bulbs in her house,

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:25.003
and she throws them up one by one
into the sky, and they all fall down.

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.131
<i>And so she thinks and she thinks,</i>

01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:32.594
<i>and she realizes that diamonds,
they sparkle like the stars.</i>

01:07:33.095 --> 01:07:36.473
<i>So she pops all of her diamonds
out of her tiara,</i>

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.517
and she takes her slingshot,

01:07:39.017 --> 01:07:43.647
and she just, like, slings them up
into the sky one by one.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:48.861
And they went-- They go farther
and farther than the light bulbs.

01:07:48.944 --> 01:07:50.279
But they can't go far enough.

01:07:50.863 --> 01:07:52.614
<i>And they all come raining down on her.</i>

01:07:53.949 --> 01:07:56.410
<i>So Pinky thinks,
and she thinks and she thinks.</i>

01:07:56.493 --> 01:08:00.706
<i>And then she thinks, "Lemons.
Lemons are yellow like the stars."</i>

01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:02.374
But lemons are very heavy.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:03.959
So...

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:08.088
<i>She finds this leaf blower
under a pile of old leaves</i>

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:10.424
<i>and she starts putting the lemons
in her leaf blower.</i>

01:08:10.507 --> 01:08:15.179
She's firing lemons out of her leaf blower
because it's so powerful, right?

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:19.975
<i>And the lemons go flying up in the sky,
and they go farther than the diamonds.</i>

01:08:20.058 --> 01:08:23.687
<i>Farther than the light bulbs.
But they don't go far enough.</i>

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:26.273
<i>And they come tumbling down on Pinky.</i>

01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:29.568
<i>She didn't know what to do</i>

01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:32.112
because there was nothing to wish on,
not just for her,

01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:36.992
but for all the little kids in the world.
All the big kids too.

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:41.912
Without stars, the world
would be a dark and hopeless place.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:47.544
So what did she wish for?

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:57.930
Okay, Julie, when you're ready,
I'm gonna ask for one more big push.

01:08:58.013 --> 01:08:59.973
-Okay, okay.
-Close your eyes.

01:09:00.057 --> 01:09:01.600
Keep pushing.

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:03.352
With all you got.

01:09:04.228 --> 01:09:07.397
-Harder. Keep pushing. Keep pushing.
-There you are, sweetheart.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:08.941
-Keep pushing.
-Push.

01:09:14.821 --> 01:09:15.697
What?

01:09:17.032 --> 01:09:18.075
You made a good one.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:20.911
Is she okay? Is she okay?

01:09:20.993 --> 01:09:22.828
-She's okay. It's okay.
-Okay.

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:25.791
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:28.836
She's perfect.

01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:30.754
She's beautiful.

01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:31.755
She's perfect.

01:09:32.673 --> 01:09:34.633
She's... She's so perfect.

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.094
It's over.

01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:47.270
Mama's gonna do this for you, okay?

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:50.649
Yeah.

01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:53.652
Oh, you can have that, bubs.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:09.042
You know,
there's nothing wrong with a bottle.

01:10:15.382 --> 01:10:16.258
Babies.

01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:22.264
They come into this world
trusting little creatures, huh?

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:29.229
I remember when you were born, you...

01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:32.733
You looked at me

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:36.403
believing like I had all the answers.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.992
And I remember thinking
how brave you were...

01:10:44.828 --> 01:10:46.038
to believe that.

01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:50.792
Jule.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.630
I'm sorry I didn't have all the answers.

01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:57.257
I know, Ma.

01:10:58.175 --> 01:10:59.259
But you do.

01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:01.053
You always have.

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:04.306
That was my mistake.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.226
Looking to you for the answers.

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:12.105
But you can do this, Jule.

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:13.815
You can.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.818
She's gonna be okay.

01:11:17.528 --> 01:11:19.112
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:21.782
Hell, even I'm gonna be okay.

01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:26.828
Just think of all those widowers
out there just dying to remarry, huh?

01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:29.831
I love you, Mom.

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:32.167
You're my baby.

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:38.966
I have a big brother who is very excited
to meet his little sister.

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.050
Hi.

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:43.095
This is your little sister.

01:11:43.178 --> 01:11:45.681
It's your job to protect her, big brother.

01:11:45.764 --> 01:11:47.057
Think you can do that?

01:11:48.684 --> 01:11:49.893
Of course you can.

01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:51.395
Wanna touch her?

01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:53.105
-Wanna touch the baby?
-Come here.

01:11:53.188 --> 01:11:54.064
Say hi.

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:56.817
-Come here.
-There she is.

01:11:57.651 --> 01:12:00.737
-Yeah. Brought a balloon just for you.
-Who's that?

01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:02.489
-Okay.
-Gotta get this on video.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:03.657
Okay.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:08.078
Today is October 9th, 1995.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.959
And we have just welcomed
a new member into our family.

01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:16.044
This is Rachel.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:17.921
-She's very happy to be here.
-Hey, baby.

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:22.801
-She was seven pounds, nine ounces.
-Seven pounds, eight ounces.

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:24.845
-Seven pounds, eight ounces.
-She'll get there.

01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:30.058
-Born at 9:48 p.m.
-9:48.

01:12:30.142 --> 01:12:33.061
-Can you say, "Hi, Rachel"?
-Sorry to disturb you.

01:12:34.146 --> 01:12:35.230
It's bath time.

01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:38.734
-It's bath time.
-Teddy, let's go watch the bath.

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:41.153
-Let's go watch the bath.
-Yeah, go with Grandma.

01:12:41.236 --> 01:12:43.906
Okay. I'll put her in.

01:12:43.989 --> 01:12:44.948
She's sleeping.

01:12:45.032 --> 01:12:46.241
She'll be okay.

01:12:46.325 --> 01:12:47.951
-She's sleeping.
-Look at that baby.

01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:49.536
-Sleeping.
-Do you see that baby?

01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:52.164
-Do you see her?
-Have a nice bath, my bubba.

01:12:52.664 --> 01:12:54.249
That's your little sister.

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:55.709
Isn't she something?

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:56.877
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:59.505
-We'll be right back.
-Okay.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.475
Did you take your medicine?

01:13:13.769 --> 01:13:16.438
No. It's in my overnight bag.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:33.997
But I'm not gonna take them.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:38.502
Just six weeks, that's all I need.

01:13:38.585 --> 01:13:42.089
I mean, I did it for nine months,
so what's six more weeks, right?

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:44.466
-I promise I'm gonna take them.
-Jule.

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.301
I'm gonna. I--

01:13:46.385 --> 01:13:48.804
I know, put the cabin pressure mask
on yourself. I get it.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:50.806
No, I get that,
and if I'm taking a nose dive,

01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:54.560
if I feel like I'm losing it,
they will be right there.

01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:56.478
They'll be right there,
and I'll take them.

01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:02.025
I promise. I know it's not okay, but okay?

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:04.152
No. No, it's not okay.

01:14:05.696 --> 01:14:07.614
I'm not going down this road
with you again.

01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:10.701
And your promise doesn't mean anything.

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:15.539
I mean, you left our kid alone
in a fucking ExerSaucer.

01:14:18.542 --> 01:14:20.252
You're gonna bring this up now?

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:22.296
Don't make me the asshole here, okay?

01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:25.048
For the last year,
I've been walking on eggshells around you

01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:26.967
because I know
how to keep my end of a deal.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.386
It's not fair
that you're bringing this up now.

01:14:29.469 --> 01:14:32.389
Don't talk about fair, okay?
This isn't about you!

01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:39.271
It's not actually about you.
It's about them.

01:14:40.522 --> 01:14:41.440
Yeah.

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:01.335
Are you happy now?

01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:20.479
I'm gonna go catch up with them.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:22.981
Ethan.

01:15:26.652 --> 01:15:29.404
I-- I can't take it.

01:15:31.782 --> 01:15:32.950
I can't.

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:36.078
You see me spiraling, that's it.

01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:38.372
I promise.

01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:42.084
You can check under my tongue, okay?
I just can't.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:53.030
You got that other crayon right there?
Can I have that one?

01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:55.157
That's really good.

01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:57.159
That's very good coloring.

01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:59.203
What about this color?
Did you want this one?

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:02.289
I can give this one to you. I don't mind.

01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:03.207
Okay.

01:17:03.707 --> 01:17:04.917
Where's the big guy?

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:07.503
-Hi.
-Hi. Hi, bud.

01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:09.129
-Oh, she's sleeping.
-Yeah.

01:17:11.632 --> 01:17:13.175
Looks amazing in here.

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:17.387
-Is this the new stuff?
-Some of it, yeah.

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:23.227
-Another canopy bed?
-Yeah.

01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:27.773
-Is that the star monster?
-Can you tell?

01:17:29.107 --> 01:17:30.692
-Scary.
-Bad guy.

01:17:33.946 --> 01:17:34.947
No stars.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:38.408
No stars. But don't worry,
I'm working on the happy stuff now.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.370
-Yeah, show me that one.
-No, not yet. It's a surprise.

01:17:41.954 --> 01:17:42.829
For later.

01:17:43.914 --> 01:17:44.748
Okay.

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:46.875
-I got to go.
-I know.

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:47.793
Bye.

01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:50.295
Bye, buddy.

01:17:52.381 --> 01:17:53.841
-Have a good day at work.
-Bye.

01:18:01.223 --> 01:18:02.432
Everything is okay.

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:04.560
Okay?

01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:06.937
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.146
Okay, bye.

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:10.065
-Stop worrying.
-Okay.

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:12.484
-Have a good day at work.
-Bye.

01:18:16.238 --> 01:18:17.155
Bye, Daddy.

01:18:33.463 --> 01:18:36.049
I think I see Nana coming up the road.

01:18:37.426 --> 01:18:38.760
Is that Nana?

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:39.970
Is that Nana?

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:43.307
Is that Nana? Oh, Nana's here.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.349
Come on.

01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:48.020
I'm coming, Mom.

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:50.272
Nice and slow.

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:53.400
Mom, I'm coming.

01:18:53.483 --> 01:18:55.861
Good. Good.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:58.530
Hi.

01:18:58.614 --> 01:19:02.576
Hi, Teddy. Hello, my baby boy.

01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:04.912
Won't you say hello to Grandma?

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:12.169
He wanted to come back home.

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:16.089
You didn't say yes, did you?
Did you say yes?

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.676
Well, I didn't say no.

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:22.471
Be nice, Jule.

01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:26.517
-He's the only father you got.
-Yeah.

01:19:27.226 --> 01:19:29.686
Hey, look. Come here, baby.

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.314
Here's your grandpa.

01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:33.982
Hey.

01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:42.407
Mom says you're looking for a painter.

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:30.873
God, this is just like
the view out of your old room.

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:36.837
Remember these?

01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:43.510
Yeah, of course I do.

01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:51.351
You know, you used to have
innies just like those.

01:21:02.446 --> 01:21:04.364
Probably shouldn't have her
around the fumes.

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:06.450
It's latex, nothing to worry about.

01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:09.119
-Hey, Ma?
-We're in Teddy's room. But wait, wait.

01:21:09.203 --> 01:21:10.579
-We're not ready yet.
-Oh, okay.

01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:12.915
Okay. It's a bird. It's a plane.

01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:15.876
It's Superman!

01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:17.669
Look at you!

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:20.797
-I love you. You look so good.
-You look great.

01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:22.382
You look so good.

01:21:22.966 --> 01:21:25.302
-Come here.
-Mommy always loved Halloween.

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:28.055
-We're gonna get a little change.
-What's the matter, baby?

01:21:28.138 --> 01:21:31.475
-She needs a little change.
-Do you wanna help me?

01:21:31.558 --> 01:21:33.477
-I'm gonna help Dad paint.
-Okay. Okay.

01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:36.355
Hello, baby. Hello, my baby girl.

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:38.398
Yeah, I love you.
Are you gonna help me?

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.943
Oh, my goodness.

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:03.382
That's a pretty color.

01:22:04.132 --> 01:22:05.050
I hope so.

01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:07.469
Hey, let me set you up.

01:22:09.638 --> 01:22:11.181
So take this...

01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:16.436
and hold it sort of like that.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.563
Okay, got it.

01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:19.815
There you go. Like that.

01:22:19.898 --> 01:22:24.736
The guy at the paint store said
these were lint-free roller covers,

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.781
but they are never
lint-free roller covers,

01:22:27.865 --> 01:22:30.701
and we don't want any lint bunnies here.

01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:32.661
You take that. I'll take that.

01:22:35.873 --> 01:22:38.876
Now, just like I taught you...

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:40.002
Just...

01:22:41.378 --> 01:22:42.713
Shape...

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:45.465
smear...

01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:48.135
and then spread.

01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:51.471
All right.

01:22:53.432 --> 01:22:54.850
Perfect every time.

01:22:56.018 --> 01:22:56.852
That's it.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.399
There you go.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.161
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, flower.

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:22.836
I'm sorry.

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:25.380
I'm so sorry.

01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:34.700
That's yours. That's for you.

01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:36.201
Pop.

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:40.539
Wow, they're so big.

01:24:40.622 --> 01:24:42.291
<i>There's none left anymore.</i>

01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:46.253
Mama has to go get more.
Mama will have to go get more.

01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:48.463
Oh, it's okay. All right, come on.

01:24:49.131 --> 01:24:51.008
Do you want some milky?
You want some milky?

01:24:51.091 --> 01:24:52.092
Okay.

01:24:54.261 --> 01:24:56.555
Okay, all right.
You're holding onto my hair.

01:24:56.638 --> 01:24:57.890
Okay. Okay.

01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:03.395
Okay, baby.

01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:07.566
Oh, come on, what do you need?

01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:11.612
What do you need?
What do you need? What do you need?

01:25:12.112 --> 01:25:14.531
Yeah, I know.
Come on, I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:20.621
It's okay.

01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:26.043
We're gonna get you your bottle.

01:25:31.882 --> 01:25:34.468
Teddy, I'm right here, okay?

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:37.596
Hey, it's coming. It's coming.

01:25:40.807 --> 01:25:42.559
It's coming. It's okay.

01:25:44.228 --> 01:25:45.604
What am I doing wrong?

01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:00.035
Teddy, I'm right here, okay?

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:01.954
Come on. Come on.

01:26:04.915 --> 01:26:07.417
Baby girl, please,
please, please stop crying.

01:26:30.232 --> 01:26:31.733
You put all the rocks down already.

01:26:33.277 --> 01:26:34.778
You put them all down already.

01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:37.447
You can go get them.

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:40.367
Go ahead.

01:26:41.285 --> 01:26:43.161
-Hi, guys.
-You put all the rocks-- Hi.

01:26:43.245 --> 01:26:46.164
Look, it's Daddy. There he is.

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:47.749
You're home so early.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.585
-Hi.
-There he is.

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:52.880
-How's it going?
-Good.

01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:53.797
-Good.
-Yeah.

01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:55.799
-Her room looks really good.
-Great.

01:26:55.883 --> 01:26:58.635
We picked a good color. It's so pretty.

01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:00.929
-She's gonna like it.
-Good.

01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:04.349
All right, well, me and this guy have
very important business to take care of.

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:06.476
You wanna come with?
We can get some pizza.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.980
Nah, you guys have some boy time.
We'll have some girl time.

01:27:10.814 --> 01:27:13.025
-Okay.
-Yeah. Have fun.

01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:16.653
-All right, we'll be back in an hour.
-Okay.

01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:20.657
Bye. Bye.

01:27:22.576 --> 01:27:23.744
Bye, guys.

01:27:27.873 --> 01:27:28.916
We love you.

01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:42.471
<i>Pinky Tinkerbink and her mommy
were best friends.</i>

01:27:44.097 --> 01:27:45.682
<i>They went to the park together.</i>

01:27:47.017 --> 01:27:48.060
<i>Baked together.</i>

01:27:49.478 --> 01:27:50.896
<i>Played dress-up together.</i>

01:27:52.523 --> 01:27:54.858
<i>Then one day, Pinky's mommy got sick...</i>

01:27:56.318 --> 01:27:58.111
<i>and they couldn't play</i> <i>together anymore.</i>

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:10.415
<i>Every night before bed, Pinky would wish
on</i> <i>a star for her mommy to be okay.</i>

01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:16.171
<i>But little by little, the stars
were starting to</i> <i>disappear from the sky.</i>

01:28:17.089 --> 01:28:19.007
<i>And her mommy was not getting better.</i>

01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:22.469
<i>One night, Pinky looked out the window,</i>

01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:25.055
<i>and all the stars were gone.</i>

01:28:25.931 --> 01:28:28.016
<i>There was nothing left for her
to wish upon.</i>

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.434
This one?

01:28:30.269 --> 01:28:32.312
Or this one?

01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:34.815
<i>Pinky's magic finger began to tingle.</i>

01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:40.070
<i>She thought and thought
and thought and thought.</i>

01:28:41.864 --> 01:28:45.492
<i>"I need to get the stars back
into the sky," Pinky told her mommy.</i>

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:47.494
<i>"But I don't know how."</i>

01:28:47.578 --> 01:28:48.954
<i>I think this is the winner.</i>

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:49.955
What do you think?

01:28:50.747 --> 01:28:53.542
-I think we're gonna start here.
-Sure, I'll be right back.

01:29:04.845 --> 01:29:06.680
<i>...two and 15/16ths,</i>

01:29:07.306 --> 01:29:08.140
and go.

01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:16.356
Oh, backwards?

01:29:17.357 --> 01:29:18.192
Okay.

01:29:25.699 --> 01:29:27.326
Mommy loves you, baby.

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:31.747
There's nothing more fun
than making something dirty, huh?

01:29:32.998 --> 01:29:34.708
Oh, thank you, yes, I needed some dirt.

01:30:40.315 --> 01:30:46.363
<i>So Pinky defeats the star monster
and returns all the stars to the sky.</i>

01:30:48.448 --> 01:30:52.035
And then kids all over the world
get to wish again.

01:30:53.537 --> 01:30:54.371
Is that right?

01:30:58.292 --> 01:30:59.459
It's a pretty good ending.

01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:02.212
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:08.760
What does Pinky wish for?

01:31:11.388 --> 01:31:12.222
Pinky?

01:31:14.975 --> 01:31:15.851
Yeah.

01:31:18.937 --> 01:31:19.771
This.

01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:24.067
All she ever wanted was this.

01:31:32.784 --> 01:31:35.704
Hi. I'm here to see
Rachel Davis Nathan.

01:31:35.787 --> 01:31:37.039
-Dad.
-She just gave birth.

01:31:38.373 --> 01:31:39.374
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:31:44.296 --> 01:31:45.339
Wait till you see her.

01:31:49.092 --> 01:31:51.094
Hey, look who I found.

01:31:54.056 --> 01:31:55.015
Hi.

01:31:56.725 --> 01:31:59.978
-Congratulations, Grandpa.
-Oh, congrats to you.

01:32:00.479 --> 01:32:01.939
Here, give this to your sister.

01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:04.191
Hold on, you.

01:32:08.612 --> 01:32:09.655
How you feeling?

01:32:10.322 --> 01:32:11.156
It's okay.

01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:13.534
Hello.

01:32:14.826 --> 01:32:17.955
-Hello.
-She's very excited to meet you.

01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:21.333
Likewise.

01:32:22.251 --> 01:32:23.252
Hi.

01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:26.338
Hi.

01:32:27.548 --> 01:32:29.508
I know. I know.

01:32:32.845 --> 01:32:34.346
Here we go.

01:32:35.722 --> 01:32:36.765
Hi.

01:32:37.558 --> 01:32:38.433
Thanks.

01:32:57.286 --> 01:33:02.749
<i>You know, baby, sometimes
the stars are blocked by the clouds,</i>

01:33:04.918 --> 01:33:08.505
<i>and sometimes
they'll be outshined by the sun.</i>

01:33:10.591 --> 01:33:12.551
<i>Sometimes they hide behind the moon.</i>

01:33:16.263 --> 01:33:19.183
Even if you don't see them,
they are always there.

01:33:22.769 --> 01:33:24.104
It's just like me.

01:33:26.732 --> 01:33:28.400
Even if you don't see me...

01:33:31.737 --> 01:33:33.572
my love is always with you.
