WEBVTT

00:01.198 --> 00:02.438
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.439 --> 00:06.248
I need a good man on
the ground in Milton.

00:06.249 --> 00:07.268
It's in Delaware.

00:07.269 --> 00:09.268
Oh, okay.

00:09.269 --> 00:10.358
He's been seeing an IS girl.

00:10.359 --> 00:11.458
I'm sorry. I'll offset.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.308
Does this mean you've been seeing her

00:13.309 --> 00:14.408
and lying to us the whole time?

00:14.409 --> 00:16.268
They need our help.

00:16.268 --> 00:17.288
They'll find someplace else to go,

00:17.289 --> 00:18.288
but it might take a couple days.

00:18.289 --> 00:19.458
Okay.

00:19.459 --> 00:21.358
I spoke with my dentist,
and he needs a receptionist.

00:21.359 --> 00:23.238
I could do that. I
could be a receptionist.

00:23.239 --> 00:24.408
Jason called me.

00:24.409 --> 00:26.428
He was inquiring about a
clinical test we're running here

00:26.429 --> 00:28.398
for fourth stage pancreatic cancer.

00:28.399 --> 00:29.448
He wanted to buy the drug.

00:29.449 --> 00:31.388
Well, did he say who it was for?

00:31.389 --> 00:34.228
No, but it must have been
for a person with means.

00:34.229 --> 00:36.428
How long has Steve been
away righting those wrongs?

00:36.429 --> 00:38.278
Months.

00:38.279 --> 00:39.338
What are we doing here?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.338
Looking for something.

00:40.339 --> 00:43.228
You check the balcony.

00:44.369 --> 00:45.418
Nothing.

00:45.419 --> 00:47.398
Steve would be incredibly excited

00:47.399 --> 00:51.308
about some special guests
that will be staying here.

00:51.309 --> 00:53.458
The sisters couldn't take the risk,

00:53.459 --> 00:56.428
but I told them, we will.

01:36.289 --> 01:39.438
Where there is transgression,

01:39.439 --> 01:43.348
there is also transformation.

01:43.349 --> 01:46.278
That's why we offset...

01:46.279 --> 01:49.298
to right the wrong.

01:49.299 --> 01:53.398
And through this physical
act of transforming our Earth,

01:53.399 --> 01:57.329
we heal the thing in us that is broken.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.389
I stepped out of gathering
to follow a girl...

02:11.329 --> 02:14.249
An IS girl.

02:15.459 --> 02:17.459
Go ahead and plant it.

02:30.319 --> 02:33.398
It's freezing. Isn't it gonna die?

02:33.399 --> 02:36.288
Winter's the best time to plant a tree.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.248
Roots grow strong during
the dormant months.

02:40.349 --> 02:42.288
When spring arrives,
your tree will be...

02:45.289 --> 02:46.418
Is this it?

02:46.419 --> 02:48.238
Is The Future here?

02:48.239 --> 02:50.269
That's the compound.

02:58.369 --> 03:01.348
I'm standing outside The
Meyerist Movement's compound,

03:01.349 --> 03:03.318
the extremist religious sect

03:03.319 --> 03:06.228
that is harboring six illegal
immigrants from Honduras.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.398
We're still gathering information,

03:07.399 --> 03:09.388
but there appears to be a standoff

03:09.389 --> 03:11.278
between the United States government

03:11.279 --> 03:13.318
and the members of what
many in this community

03:13.319 --> 03:16.248
are fearing is a cult.

03:20.429 --> 03:22.338
Excuse me.

03:22.339 --> 03:24.388
Have the Hondurans been
indoctrinated into the cult?

03:24.389 --> 03:26.388
This is not a cult. It's a movement.

03:26.389 --> 03:29.408
- Any further comments, miss?
- No.

03:50.359 --> 03:51.458
Okay, I'm going to school.

03:51.459 --> 03:53.378
Wait.

03:53.379 --> 03:55.458
No, I don't want you going out there.

03:55.459 --> 03:57.418
It is not safe.

03:57.419 --> 04:00.368
Well, a Novice is dropping me
at school, so I'm gonna be fine.

04:00.369 --> 04:02.328
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.398
I just...

04:03.399 --> 04:05.288
It's just this place.

04:05.289 --> 04:07.328
Everyone is so strange here.

04:07.329 --> 04:09.228
You didn't want to
stay at Hawk's anymore.

04:09.229 --> 04:10.348
- I know.
- So...

04:10.349 --> 04:12.228
This is temporary.
I'm gonna get this job.

04:12.229 --> 04:13.418
And we are gonna get out of here.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.308
Come here.

04:25.319 --> 04:26.409
Mommy?

04:29.409 --> 04:31.438
Are they coming for us?

04:36.279 --> 04:38.269
I don't know.

04:50.419 --> 04:52.389
Hello? You in there?

05:02.279 --> 05:04.298
Holy... Oh, my God!

05:04.299 --> 05:05.398
Shit. Sorry.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.338
Nope. That's...

05:07.339 --> 05:10.268
- I tried knocking.
- No, no, it's okay.

05:12.289 --> 05:15.258
I wasn't expecting you.

05:15.259 --> 05:17.378
Um...

05:17.379 --> 05:20.268
How's it going over at the compound?

05:20.269 --> 05:21.448
It sounds terrible.

05:21.449 --> 05:24.308
Yeah, I, uh, haven't made it there yet.

05:24.309 --> 05:26.308
Listen, I didn't think I'd
make it back for a while,

05:26.309 --> 05:28.369
so I brought supplies.

05:31.379 --> 05:34.229
Oh, my God. Thank you.

05:36.299 --> 05:37.458
Salami?

05:37.459 --> 05:39.448
Yeah, I wasn't sure if
you stayed vegetarian.

05:39.449 --> 05:41.408
Are you kidding? Meat is awesome.

05:41.409 --> 05:45.268
I haven't been within a mile of
bean curd since the day I left.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.298
Anyway, um...

05:47.299 --> 05:49.458
Look, just don't go outside the cottage.

05:49.459 --> 05:51.408
Okay, stay inside,

05:51.409 --> 05:55.269
and I will, uh, come and check
in on you in a couple days.

05:57.379 --> 05:59.288
Um...

05:59.289 --> 06:02.228
thank you, Eddie.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.309
Yeah.

06:10.259 --> 06:14.268
They're calling us a
controversial fringe movement.

06:14.269 --> 06:16.448
Do you know what they do to
controversial fringe movements?

06:16.449 --> 06:18.318
They set fire to their buildings

06:18.319 --> 06:20.458
and stand around and watch them burn.

06:20.459 --> 06:22.308
This is about human beings.

06:22.309 --> 06:24.458
- Where were you?
- Long story.

06:24.459 --> 06:27.278
For us to be seen in the world

06:27.279 --> 06:31.258
as a Movement with
heart, soul, and vision.

06:31.259 --> 06:32.458
If we call the government's bluff,

06:32.459 --> 06:35.348
we will be seen as a sensitive space.

06:35.349 --> 06:38.258
Or another Wako.

06:38.259 --> 06:42.268
You acted on your own
without support from us.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.328
You didn't even discuss it
with your fellow URs here.

06:44.329 --> 06:46.429
And they all support me 100%.

06:51.339 --> 06:54.348
I'm sorry, Cal. It's too dangerous.

06:54.349 --> 06:56.258
I agree with Bill and Felicia.

06:56.259 --> 06:59.248
We have kids.

06:59.249 --> 07:02.338
What about their kids?

07:02.339 --> 07:06.328
Back me up here, Eddie.

07:06.329 --> 07:08.288
This is a shitshow, Cal.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.379
I have to agree with Eddie.

07:15.319 --> 07:18.448
I'm sorry. No.

07:22.429 --> 07:27.388
Felicia and I will watch over New York

07:27.389 --> 07:31.438
until this situation is resolved.

07:31.439 --> 07:35.268
And who's supposed to
tell these innocent people

07:35.269 --> 07:36.368
that we're sending them back

07:36.369 --> 07:41.328
to endemic poverty
and horrific violence?

07:41.329 --> 07:45.288
I think it would be
appropriate for you to do that.

08:13.419 --> 08:16.338
You nervous about the helicopters?

08:16.339 --> 08:19.388
No.

08:19.389 --> 08:22.369
Sad about Sean?

08:24.419 --> 08:28.368
Look, only the strongest
Novices go into the field.

08:28.369 --> 08:31.388
He's... he's gonna do
great work in Delaware.

08:31.389 --> 08:35.268
Yeah, I'm really proud of him.

08:35.269 --> 08:36.457
Anyway, you know,

08:36.458 --> 08:41.279
if there's anything I can do to help...

08:46.429 --> 08:48.338
Panting, breathless.

08:48.339 --> 08:51.418
And that's when he sees the spy

08:51.419 --> 08:54.348
and he realizes that there is

08:54.349 --> 08:58.318
a real true world out there.

08:58.319 --> 09:01.308
So he comes back, ranting and raving.

09:01.309 --> 09:03.408
"What you think is real isn't!

09:03.409 --> 09:06.268
"You're a prisoner!
Your life isn't real!

09:06.269 --> 09:08.399
You're just looking at shadows."

09:12.349 --> 09:15.318
Agent Gaines?

09:15.319 --> 09:17.278
Agent Gaines?

09:17.279 --> 09:18.388
Would they if they could.

09:18.389 --> 09:22.288
Yes, sir. Um...

09:22.289 --> 09:23.428
I'm sorry... Did... did you need me?

09:23.429 --> 09:26.278
- I was...
- Doing good work.

09:26.279 --> 09:29.418
Suddenly, Washington's very
interested in these wackos.

09:29.419 --> 09:32.328
First Rindge, now this Honduran fiasco.

09:32.329 --> 09:34.398
I want to put you on this full-time.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.398
Report back to me on a daily basis.

09:36.399 --> 09:39.388
That's... that's great.

09:39.389 --> 09:42.358
That's great. Thanks, sir.

head back to class.

10:44.309 --> 10:46.318
Why?

10:46.319 --> 10:50.238
Because I'm really behind in geometry.

Thank you.

11:50.279 --> 11:51.428
For what?

11:51.429 --> 11:54.258
Being a friend.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.288
I've been feeling really alone.

11:56.289 --> 11:59.258
You don't ever have to feel alone again.

11:59.259 --> 12:01.359
You have a good heart.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.289
So do you.

12:08.419 --> 12:11.268
Maybe.

12:11.269 --> 12:12.448
I definitely have a headache.

12:12.449 --> 12:15.449
I can get you an Advil.

12:24.269 --> 12:27.279
Actually, you know what
would really help me?

12:32.379 --> 12:34.268
- Those have to be authorized.
- It's okay.

12:34.269 --> 12:35.348
They give 'em to me all the time.

12:35.349 --> 12:37.338
This would just save me the red tape

12:37.339 --> 12:40.328
of setting up a meeting with Richard.

12:40.329 --> 12:45.278
But if it's not okay with you...

12:45.279 --> 12:48.238
No.

12:48.239 --> 12:51.248
It's o... it's okay.

12:51.249 --> 12:53.448
Please don't tell anyone.

12:53.449 --> 12:56.369
It'll be our little secret.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.409
You're awesome.

13:16.279 --> 13:19.308
Kids, put that away.

13:19.309 --> 13:20.398
No, no, it's okay.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.328
It's okay. Keep playing.

13:23.329 --> 13:26.418
We definitely didn't
want to put you to work.

13:26.419 --> 13:28.418
You're our guests.

13:28.419 --> 13:32.329
Well, um...

13:34.269 --> 13:36.408
There's been some concern

13:36.409 --> 13:41.309
in the... the upper rungs
of our organization that...

13:44.229 --> 13:48.348
In doing what I thought was
right for you and your children,

13:48.349 --> 13:51.368
uh, it would...

13:51.369 --> 13:54.279
make our movement too vulnerable.

13:57.359 --> 13:59.458
We're not a political movement.

13:59.459 --> 14:04.378
We don't follow government or leaders.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.458
We follow the Light.

14:06.459 --> 14:09.299
The Light directs us.

14:12.229 --> 14:14.399
And the Light...

14:19.339 --> 14:22.338
The Light...

14:22.339 --> 14:27.248
tells me...

14:27.249 --> 14:29.268
that I...

14:29.269 --> 14:31.419
I have to fight for you.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.279
Your fate is my fate.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.258
But don't worry.

14:42.259 --> 14:44.318
I won't let anything
happen to you, okay?

14:44.319 --> 14:46.268
All right, I'm the leader here.

14:46.269 --> 14:48.389
So...

14:50.269 --> 14:51.439
All right.

15:10.399 --> 15:13.408
What's going on?

15:13.409 --> 15:17.269
Why were you late to the
meeting yesterday morning?

15:19.439 --> 15:23.368
I, uh, had a field
meeting with a Possible.

15:23.369 --> 15:27.288
While there were helicopters
hovering over the compound?

15:27.289 --> 15:29.278
I didn't think I'd be needed.

15:29.279 --> 15:30.408
Well, I did need you.

15:34.379 --> 15:38.348
For a lot of things.

15:38.349 --> 15:41.408
But also, I can't stop thinking

15:41.409 --> 15:45.258
about Evelyn and her kids.

15:45.259 --> 15:48.388
What if they were our children?

15:48.389 --> 15:52.438
Look, Cal fucked up, okay?

15:52.439 --> 15:55.448
It was not the way to help.

15:55.449 --> 15:58.298
Everything feels so difficult now.

15:58.299 --> 15:59.388
I just can't help but think

15:59.389 --> 16:02.349
if you and I were on the same page...

16:17.259 --> 16:20.438
Okay, you are now
officially a Receptive.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.428
- What size T-shirt?
- Usually a large.

16:22.429 --> 16:26.348
So your initiation fee gives
you membership for the year

16:26.349 --> 16:29.278
and one free 1R or 2R class.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.408
But if you want a 2R class

16:30.409 --> 16:32.278
before you've received 1R certification,

16:32.279 --> 16:33.418
you'll need approval from the teacher.

16:33.419 --> 16:35.448
Personally, I never
recommend jumping rungs.

16:35.449 --> 16:39.238
Well, then I won't.

16:39.239 --> 16:42.268
I'm sorry it's been
so crazy around here.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.458
Hopefully it will all be over soon.

16:43.459 --> 16:45.428
Well, I'm sure the Upper Rungs
are taking care of things.

16:45.429 --> 16:47.398
They always do.

16:47.399 --> 16:49.358
I'm so glad you've decided
to spend more time with us.

16:49.359 --> 16:52.358
Yeah, I want to spend a lot more time.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.248
You know, I'm thinking
about living The Ladder.

16:55.249 --> 16:59.298
We would love to have you.

16:59.299 --> 17:01.318
Mind if I christen this?

17:01.319 --> 17:03.268
Oh, we don't christen anything.

17:03.269 --> 17:04.397
Right.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.319
My bad.

17:15.398 --> 17:17.367
Seems like a fit to me.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.387
We've been in communication with ICE.

17:19.388 --> 17:21.338
We all agree the best way to do this

17:21.339 --> 17:23.308
is to quietly get the
Hondurans to the city

17:23.309 --> 17:24.417
to turn themselves in.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.338
Can we arrange to move them tonight?

17:26.339 --> 17:28.268
We'll get into it.

17:28.269 --> 17:30.318
Has anyone told the
refugees they're being moved?

17:30.319 --> 17:31.428
I've spoken to them.

17:31.429 --> 17:34.258
And, uh...

17:34.259 --> 17:37.278
I told them that they're staying,

17:37.279 --> 17:40.368
that we intend to protect them.

17:40.369 --> 17:42.388
We need to speak privately.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.348
No, no, no, that's actually the opposite

17:44.349 --> 17:46.419
of what we need to do.

18:07.379 --> 18:10.308
What is this? What's going on?

18:10.309 --> 18:13.448
The Meyerist Movement was never intended

18:13.449 --> 18:17.358
to be three people at the
highest rungs duking it out.

18:17.359 --> 18:20.268
It was meant to be a circle.

18:20.269 --> 18:23.338
Shouldn't we know what
our youngest members think?

18:23.339 --> 18:25.228
They're closer than anybody else here

18:25.229 --> 18:27.239
to being one of those refugees.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.359
Okay.

18:35.279 --> 18:38.238
Point taken.

18:38.239 --> 18:39.399
Thank you all so much.

18:42.349 --> 18:45.238
- You can leave now.
- Not yet.

18:45.239 --> 18:49.299
I think we need to take a
vote that includes all rungs.

18:55.379 --> 18:57.399
We'd like to call for a vote.

19:04.259 --> 19:05.358
Richard.

19:05.359 --> 19:07.238
I don't agree with what you're doing.

19:07.239 --> 19:09.348
- I understand that.
- It's not a good idea.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.408
I believe that this is the
right thing for us to do.

19:11.409 --> 19:13.288
- Excuse me.
- Just listen to me...

19:13.289 --> 19:15.328
May I speak to you
privately for a second?

19:15.329 --> 19:17.458
We'll talk later. Yes.

19:17.459 --> 19:20.378
How could you do this
without telling anyone?

19:20.379 --> 19:22.418
Bill and Felicia didn't
tell me they were coming here

19:22.419 --> 19:23.458
to take away my authority.

19:23.459 --> 19:25.318
I'm talking about me.

19:25.319 --> 19:27.288
Well, I tried talking to you, Sarah.

19:27.289 --> 19:28.428
Oh, because I didn't support
you, you decided to rogue?

19:28.429 --> 19:30.378
So support me now, all right?

19:30.379 --> 19:32.238
Do this with me. You know
it's the right thing to do.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.308
That is all I ever do,
is support you here.

19:34.309 --> 19:36.458
You seem to be so progressive,
but when it comes to the sexes,

19:36.459 --> 19:38.438
it's like we're in the 1950s.

19:38.439 --> 19:41.288
Woman in the shadows while
we're still supporting the men.

19:41.289 --> 19:42.388
If you're in the shadows,

19:42.389 --> 19:44.368
it's because you put yourself there.

19:44.369 --> 19:46.338
You want to be a leader?

19:46.339 --> 19:48.229
Be one.

19:54.229 --> 19:56.458
Hey, Dad.

19:56.459 --> 19:58.438
Got a strange call.

19:58.439 --> 20:00.268
Someone staying up at your cabin?

20:00.269 --> 20:02.398
This time of year? No, sir.

20:02.399 --> 20:04.368
What's going on?

20:04.369 --> 20:08.238
Someone just saw some blonde
woman outside Hank's cabin.

20:08.239 --> 20:11.238
I haven't stashed blondes
up there since the '70s.

20:11.239 --> 20:12.388
Who told you this, Russ?

20:12.389 --> 20:14.248
We have a few members who
keep an eye on the place.

20:14.249 --> 20:15.298
Uh-huh.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.248
It's probably a mistake.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.328
I'll check it out.

20:20.329 --> 20:23.298
Russ...

20:53.309 --> 20:54.418
Hey, it's me.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.458
If you get this, get
out of there now, okay?

20:56.459 --> 20:58.278
Leave!

20:58.279 --> 21:00.389
Get someplace safe. Go, go, go!

21:16.329 --> 21:19.249
Alison! Alison!

21:21.329 --> 21:22.388
You have got to get
out of here right now.

21:22.389 --> 21:24.268
- They know you're here.
- How?

21:24.269 --> 21:25.408
- Did you go outside?
- No. I just...

21:25.409 --> 21:27.298
Maybe for five minutes
to get some fresh air,

21:27.299 --> 21:28.348
but nobody saw me.

21:28.349 --> 21:30.258
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait!

21:30.259 --> 21:33.408
Come on!

21:33.409 --> 21:35.308
I can explain.

21:35.309 --> 21:37.248
I'll talk to you later.

21:37.249 --> 21:39.278
Come on, Alison.

21:39.279 --> 21:42.348
Come back with me.

21:42.349 --> 21:44.288
You can unburden.

21:44.289 --> 21:47.418
We'll talk this through.

21:47.419 --> 21:50.338
No big deal.

22:15.419 --> 22:16.448
Go!

22:48.229 --> 22:51.279
Can we have a real conversation, Eddie?

22:52.449 --> 22:56.319
Because I think that you
haven't been honest...

22:57.429 --> 23:00.338
Not for a long time.

23:00.339 --> 23:03.459
I know that you never had
an affair with Miranda Frank.

23:05.449 --> 23:11.249
I know something else
happened to you in Peru.

23:14.429 --> 23:18.368
Miranda told me what you said...

23:18.369 --> 23:20.459
that there was no Light.

23:27.379 --> 23:30.378
When I was in Peru,

23:30.379 --> 23:34.278
I had a vision

23:34.279 --> 23:38.388
of Steve dying.

23:38.389 --> 23:41.448
But it was more than that.

23:41.449 --> 23:46.328
I just had a feeling that...

23:46.329 --> 23:49.418
this was all bullshit...

23:49.419 --> 23:53.328
that there was no Ladder,

23:53.329 --> 23:56.329
that there was no Light.

24:04.249 --> 24:07.259
Is that true?

24:09.259 --> 24:11.359
No.

24:17.449 --> 24:20.448
All right.

24:20.449 --> 24:23.398
So what happens now?

24:23.399 --> 24:26.228
You, uh...

24:26.229 --> 24:29.348
you tell Sarah about all this?

24:29.349 --> 24:30.458
Huh?

24:30.459 --> 24:33.448
I mean, that's what you want, right?

24:33.449 --> 24:36.388
Destroy our marriage so
you can finally have her?

24:36.389 --> 24:38.338
I don't have to destroy your marriage.

24:38.339 --> 24:41.418
You're just doing just
fine with that on your own.

24:50.399 --> 24:52.399
I want you to take The Walk.

24:54.379 --> 24:56.298
Steve's Walk?

24:56.299 --> 24:59.388
You can't live among us,

24:59.389 --> 25:02.248
call yourself a follower,

25:02.249 --> 25:04.338
and not believe.

25:04.339 --> 25:06.338
You can't have it both ways.

25:06.339 --> 25:09.418
- It's fucking December, Cal.
- You'll do The Walk.

25:09.419 --> 25:11.448
And if...

25:11.449 --> 25:15.448
if you find after 250 miles

25:15.449 --> 25:18.349
that you are still faithless...

25:21.319 --> 25:24.338
Keep walking.

25:24.339 --> 25:27.228
Don't come back.

25:27.229 --> 25:31.419
Don't bring us any more darkness.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.458
And if you don't do The Walk,

25:43.459 --> 25:48.308
I will tell Sarah everything...

25:48.309 --> 25:51.319
about Miranda, about Alison.

25:56.309 --> 25:58.458
I'll tell her you don't believe.

26:18.259 --> 26:20.228
Dr. Gottlieb is wonderful.

26:20.229 --> 26:23.238
A brilliant dentist and the
kindest man you'll ever meet.

26:23.239 --> 26:26.228
And this is where you would sit.

26:26.229 --> 26:28.308
- Looks like home.
- Doesn't it?

26:28.309 --> 26:30.298
So do you have any experience
in the dental field?

26:30.299 --> 26:32.258
Oh, no. I don't.

26:32.259 --> 26:33.438
They said that wasn't a requirement.

26:33.439 --> 26:35.308
Oh, that's okay.

26:35.309 --> 26:36.458
Tell me about your most
recent work experience.

26:36.459 --> 26:38.448
Well, actually, I've
been a stay-at-home mom

26:38.449 --> 26:40.458
for a really long time.

26:40.459 --> 26:42.458
And I'm just getting
back into the work force.

26:42.459 --> 26:46.388
When I did work, it was mostly
in the restaurant industry...

26:46.389 --> 26:48.458
waiting tables.

26:48.459 --> 26:51.378
I know that's not
really similar to this.

26:51.379 --> 26:53.408
Oh, sweetie, don't worry about it.

26:53.409 --> 26:56.458
Sarah Lane sent you. You're hired.

26:56.459 --> 27:00.438
Oh, and I forgot tell you
the best part of the job.

27:00.439 --> 27:03.459
This is where we find
the Light when we need it.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.378
These people have been a plague

27:12.379 --> 27:14.388
to our God-fearing community.

27:14.389 --> 27:17.328
They're bringing looting
and theft to our town.

27:17.329 --> 27:19.438
Looting? Fuck you, lady.

27:19.439 --> 27:21.348
They're praying in the cafeteria,

27:21.349 --> 27:23.288
protesting class teachings,

27:23.289 --> 27:26.328
refusing to pledge
allegiance to our nation...

27:28.229 --> 27:29.378
They take in drug addicts
and mental patients...

27:29.379 --> 27:30.448
Hey.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.378
These people...

27:32.379 --> 27:34.348
No teaching is getting done
in my daughter's school.

27:34.349 --> 27:36.248
They're praying in the cafeteria,

27:36.249 --> 27:38.358
protesting class teachings...

27:38.359 --> 27:40.378
What happened to you?

27:40.379 --> 27:42.388
Oh, um...

27:42.389 --> 27:45.318
7R with Cal.

27:45.319 --> 27:47.399
I fell. It's nothing.

27:55.389 --> 27:59.258
So Cal wants me to do The Walk.

27:59.259 --> 28:01.458
What?

28:01.459 --> 28:03.328
Why?

28:03.329 --> 28:06.368
No one ever gets sent out
in the middle of winter.

28:06.369 --> 28:09.368
Yeah, well, he wants me to leave soon...

28:09.369 --> 28:11.338
like, right away.

28:11.339 --> 28:14.329
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

28:16.449 --> 28:20.458
Look, things have been
revealed to both of us during 7R

28:20.459 --> 28:24.368
which makes it relevant
that I do it now.

28:28.439 --> 28:30.288
Where have you been?

28:30.289 --> 28:31.408
Out.

28:31.409 --> 28:33.388
- With Ashley?
- Whatever.

28:33.389 --> 28:37.408
Hey, don't you talk to your
mother with that tone, Hawk.

28:37.409 --> 28:39.429
Hey, did you hear me?

28:42.449 --> 28:44.339
Yes, sir.

28:46.429 --> 28:48.368
Sorry.

28:48.369 --> 28:51.408
Don't you dare treat her that way.

28:51.409 --> 28:53.428
That is not how our family operates.

28:53.429 --> 28:58.298
That is not our path.

28:58.299 --> 29:02.298
Maybe your path isn't my path.

29:02.299 --> 29:03.419
Hawk.

29:08.269 --> 29:10.349
I'll talk to him in the morning.

29:12.439 --> 29:16.338
You're not welcome here!
You're not welcome here!

29:16.339 --> 29:20.238
You're not welcome here!
You're not welcome here!

29:20.239 --> 29:21.388
You're not welcome here!

29:21.389 --> 29:24.369
You're not welcome here!
You're not welcome here!

29:38.249 --> 29:39.398
You're not welcome here!

29:39.399 --> 29:43.248
You're not welcome here!
You're not welcome here!

29:43.249 --> 29:44.299
You're not welcome here!

29:58.429 --> 30:00.278
Evelyn?

30:00.279 --> 30:02.308
I'm sorry that the vote will determine

30:02.309 --> 30:06.308
whether or not we can harbor you.

30:06.309 --> 30:10.268
I sent my children to the U.S.
so that they would be safe.

30:10.269 --> 30:12.278
Two years we were apart.

30:12.279 --> 30:15.388
And they were in the
hands of the coyotes.

30:15.389 --> 30:20.259
I guess I'm used to not
having my fate in my own hands.

30:25.329 --> 30:28.328
I heard your IS girl is gone.

30:28.329 --> 30:30.258
What?

30:30.259 --> 30:32.288
She and her mom took off
in the middle of the night.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.368
- Disappeared.
- Who told you that?

30:33.369 --> 30:35.458
Like, every single Novice.

30:35.459 --> 30:38.368
I told you the IS can never be trusted.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.368
They're probably the ones
who broke into the infirmary

30:40.369 --> 30:42.309
and stole the drugs.

31:02.429 --> 31:04.308
Mary.

31:04.309 --> 31:06.349
Why'd you send Sean away?

31:09.369 --> 31:12.418
Um...

31:12.419 --> 31:14.428
Mary, uh...

31:14.429 --> 31:16.388
can we talk about this later?

31:16.389 --> 31:18.438
- We have the vote...
- No, I want to know now.

31:18.439 --> 31:20.458
Why?

31:20.459 --> 31:24.378
Um...

31:24.379 --> 31:27.288
he was needed in Delaware.

31:27.289 --> 31:28.458
I thought you didn't lie here.

31:28.459 --> 31:31.378
I thought Truth was
the path to The Light.

31:31.379 --> 31:32.438
I understand you're upset...

31:32.439 --> 31:35.308
What do you want from me, Cal?

31:35.309 --> 31:37.398
Who am I to you?

31:37.399 --> 31:43.288
You're someone I care about...

31:43.289 --> 31:46.458
deeply and, um... and feel for.

31:46.459 --> 31:49.418
But I can't...

31:49.419 --> 31:53.438
It... it's not right for us
to be together the way we have.

31:53.439 --> 31:56.279
Then why send Sean away?

31:58.239 --> 32:00.358
You told me to be with him.

32:00.359 --> 32:03.368
I did it for you.

32:03.369 --> 32:07.318
And then I started to like him,

32:07.319 --> 32:09.448
want to see him,

32:09.449 --> 32:12.428
hear his voice, fuck him.

32:12.429 --> 32:14.308
Are you okay, Mary?

32:14.309 --> 32:16.388
You're not answering the question.

32:16.389 --> 32:19.288
Answer the fucking question.

32:19.289 --> 32:21.309
Why did you send him away?

32:27.359 --> 32:29.258
I'm leaving.

32:29.259 --> 32:30.438
You have to find someone
else you can fuck with.

32:30.439 --> 32:32.359
I'm sure you got plenty of options.

32:44.389 --> 32:48.258
Hello, old friend.

32:48.259 --> 32:50.338
Silas. What...

32:50.339 --> 32:52.448
what are you doing here?

32:52.449 --> 32:54.438
I've come to talk to you.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.328
Well, I can't.

32:56.329 --> 32:58.419
I can't now, 'cause we're gathering.

33:01.319 --> 33:05.288
I've traveled a long way, Calvin.

33:05.289 --> 33:08.288
Sit with me.

33:08.289 --> 33:09.348
Reflect.

33:09.349 --> 33:12.248
Let's commune.

33:12.249 --> 33:15.298
Bill and Felicia sent you?

33:15.299 --> 33:16.398
No.

33:16.399 --> 33:19.249
They want me here less than you do.

33:24.409 --> 33:27.229
Steve sent me.

33:28.409 --> 33:31.358
He isn't happy with you.

33:31.359 --> 33:34.439
Steve is half dead.

33:36.299 --> 33:39.408
I communicate with him all the time.

33:39.409 --> 33:43.459
Well, then he would remind
you that he wanted me to lead.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.348
There's nothing more to lead.

33:51.349 --> 33:54.308
That's what I've come to tell you...

33:54.309 --> 33:58.258
and Bill and Felicia.

33:58.259 --> 34:00.278
It's over.

34:00.279 --> 34:04.338
It was over when Steve could
not accept his mortality.

34:04.339 --> 34:06.328
I couldn't see it then.

34:06.329 --> 34:10.277
I was like you. I wanted to hold on.

34:10.279 --> 34:11.418
But it was over.

34:14.299 --> 34:17.257
The Movement is dead.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.408
No, no.

34:23.409 --> 34:26.248
Um...

34:26.248 --> 34:27.318
you don't understand.

34:27.319 --> 34:29.297
Um...

34:29.299 --> 34:33.408
they're waiting for me,
Silas, the next generation.

34:33.409 --> 34:38.288
They... they want me.
They believe in me.

34:38.289 --> 34:40.297
Not after I tell them the truth.

34:40.299 --> 34:45.268
No, Steve foretold a miracle
to come, a new leader.

34:45.268 --> 34:48.318
If there is one,

34:48.319 --> 34:51.239
he is not you.

34:54.289 --> 34:56.447
I see you, Calvin.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.438
I always have.

35:07.419 --> 35:10.418
You're a fraud.

35:12.399 --> 35:16.309
You can go out there and smile...

35:18.269 --> 35:22.358
But you're an alcoholic salesman...

35:22.359 --> 35:24.309
just like your father.

35:52.249 --> 35:53.309
Aah!

35:58.299 --> 36:01.318
I spent last night praying
to The Light for insight.

36:01.319 --> 36:04.459
My prayers led me to The Ladder.

36:07.299 --> 36:11.258
"As an outlier in a
Judeo-Christian society,

36:11.259 --> 36:15.228
"we must not risk the
perception of extremism

36:15.229 --> 36:19.358
"and give the government,
the church, and the media

36:19.359 --> 36:24.338
"any excuse to demonize
us or destroy us.

36:24.339 --> 36:29.238
"We must remain invisible heroes

36:29.239 --> 36:33.408
"to the needy, the
poor, the unenlightened,

36:33.409 --> 36:36.238
"but we must fiercely avoid

36:36.239 --> 36:38.368
"getting embroiled in political battles

36:38.369 --> 36:40.348
"with the powers that be,

36:40.349 --> 36:42.448
"as it will, most certainly,

36:42.449 --> 36:47.308
"rapidly, and unceremoniously,

36:47.309 --> 36:51.388
destroy all that we have built."

36:51.389 --> 36:54.298
We are at...

36:54.299 --> 36:56.308
a critical

36:56.309 --> 37:00.429
and dangerous moment in our history.

37:03.269 --> 37:06.448
At such a moment, we
must follow the guidance

37:06.449 --> 37:09.428
and infinite wisdom of our founder,

37:09.429 --> 37:14.328
who has advised that
we honor and protect

37:14.329 --> 37:17.378
all that we have built.

37:35.289 --> 37:37.398
Where's Cal?

37:40.339 --> 37:41.338
I don't know.

37:55.419 --> 37:58.288
If no one else wishes to speak,

37:58.289 --> 38:00.359
it's time to vote.

38:03.329 --> 38:05.328
I'd like to speak.

38:05.329 --> 38:06.399
Wonderful.

38:30.259 --> 38:31.358
Thank you, Bill,

38:31.359 --> 38:34.278
for sharing...

38:34.279 --> 38:36.318
those wise words with us.

38:36.319 --> 38:39.398
You're a great inspiration to all of us.

38:39.399 --> 38:44.258
But I need to present
a different perspective.

38:44.259 --> 38:47.358
This is Evelyn Hernandez.

38:47.359 --> 38:50.348
She needs our help.

38:50.349 --> 38:54.418
And so do her kids.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.458
We who follow this path,

38:57.459 --> 39:01.238
whether we are a Novice or we
have reached the tenth rung,

39:01.239 --> 39:02.408
we struggle with our relationship

39:02.409 --> 39:03.449
with the outside world.

39:07.229 --> 39:09.448
Every time we open our hearts,

39:09.449 --> 39:14.348
every time we open our gates,

39:14.349 --> 39:17.368
we take a risk.

39:17.369 --> 39:19.448
17 years ago,

39:19.449 --> 39:23.248
Steve took a risk on a young man

39:23.249 --> 39:27.328
with so much pain and so
much anger in his heart

39:27.329 --> 39:32.448
that he was willing to
kill anything in his path.

39:36.229 --> 39:38.278
If Steve hadn't opened our gates,

39:38.279 --> 39:41.448
hadn't taken a chance on him,

39:41.449 --> 39:45.378
I wouldn't have found
the love of my life.

39:45.379 --> 39:49.268
I wouldn't have had
my beautiful children.

39:49.269 --> 39:51.459
And I wouldn't be me.

39:55.269 --> 39:58.338
So I ask when you cast your vote today,

39:58.339 --> 40:01.448
you remember that we are all here

40:01.449 --> 40:06.269
because someone took a risk on us.

40:10.359 --> 40:14.258
Let us stay strong for the weak.

40:14.259 --> 40:18.298
Be a beacon for the undirected.

40:18.299 --> 40:21.328
In times of struggle...

40:21.329 --> 40:24.298
We are one.

40:24.299 --> 40:27.288
In times of strife...

40:27.289 --> 40:30.368
We are strong.

40:30.369 --> 40:33.238
In time of change...

40:33.239 --> 40:35.268
We remain.

40:35.269 --> 40:36.418
If darkness falls...

40:36.419 --> 40:39.248
We are Light.

40:39.249 --> 40:41.268
If darkness falls...

40:41.269 --> 40:43.348
We are Light.

40:45.439 --> 40:48.278
When darkness falls...

40:48.279 --> 40:49.458
We are light!

41:06.299 --> 41:10.358
Out! Out! Out! Out!

41:15.289 --> 41:16.328
Mary...

41:16.329 --> 41:17.378
Mary!

41:17.379 --> 41:19.278
Hey, hey, that is my daughter.

41:19.279 --> 41:24.278
Mary, you need to come home!

41:24.279 --> 41:26.368
Mary!

41:26.369 --> 41:29.328
- You guys okay?
- Yep.

41:29.329 --> 41:31.378
We're gonna make it
work. It's gonna be fine.

41:31.379 --> 41:33.368
Okay? Everything's gonna be great.

41:33.369 --> 41:35.448
Go inside, and we're gonna...

41:35.449 --> 41:37.328
I'll be right back.

41:37.329 --> 41:40.278
- Ashley.
- I just need a minute.

41:41.439 --> 41:43.418
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:43.419 --> 41:46.338
Um...

41:46.339 --> 41:48.378
What's going on? Why'd you leave?

41:48.379 --> 41:50.418
I had to. My...

41:50.419 --> 41:54.358
My mom freaked out.

41:54.359 --> 41:57.338
Why?

41:57.339 --> 41:59.258
'Cause she said it's a cult

41:59.259 --> 42:02.398
and that we had to get out of here.

42:02.399 --> 42:04.428
We're helping your family.

42:04.429 --> 42:06.298
Yeah, I know you were, but...

42:06.299 --> 42:07.459
But what?

42:10.369 --> 42:13.419
I can't see you anymore.

42:18.389 --> 42:20.259
What?

42:21.439 --> 42:24.269
My mom doesn't want me to.

42:26.309 --> 42:30.348
Um, so my mom doesn't
want me to see you.

42:30.349 --> 42:32.248
Yeah, but it's different.

42:32.249 --> 42:34.228
Like, look what's
happening to my family.

42:34.229 --> 42:35.428
I really need to be there
for my mom right now.

42:35.429 --> 42:37.448
Ashley, you're the only thing
that makes any sense to me.

42:37.449 --> 42:39.318
- Everything is so messed up.
- Ashley!

42:39.319 --> 42:40.448
I really just need things to be normal.

42:40.449 --> 42:42.228
I have to go.

42:42.229 --> 42:43.338
Ashley.

42:43.339 --> 42:46.259
Ash... Ashley!

43:28.399 --> 43:33.228
You were amazing today.

43:33.229 --> 43:35.338
When you were speaking,

43:35.339 --> 43:38.308
I could finally see
what you could be here.

43:38.309 --> 43:41.388
Hopefully they won't set
fire to the compound tonight.

43:41.389 --> 43:44.368
Well, if they do,

43:44.369 --> 43:48.278
it will have been for
all of the right reasons.

43:48.279 --> 43:50.318
So how'd it feel,

43:50.319 --> 43:53.428
inspiring all those people?

43:53.429 --> 43:57.248
Good.

43:57.249 --> 43:59.328
Really good.

44:14.389 --> 44:18.248
I'm gonna miss you.

44:18.249 --> 44:21.278
Miss you so much.

44:21.279 --> 44:25.238
It's gonna be long

44:25.239 --> 44:26.408
and hard.

44:26.409 --> 44:30.238
But it will end, and you will come back.

44:30.239 --> 44:32.458
Take comfort in knowing that.

44:36.309 --> 44:38.288
Hawk.

44:38.289 --> 44:40.278
Honey, what's wrong?

44:42.409 --> 44:45.228
I want to come with you.

44:45.229 --> 44:46.368
What?

44:46.369 --> 44:48.408
I want to Walk.

44:48.409 --> 44:52.258
I want to Walk with you.

44:52.259 --> 44:54.288
Son, you, uh...

44:54.289 --> 44:56.248
you do this alone.

44:56.249 --> 44:57.458
Please.

44:57.459 --> 44:59.359
I need to.

45:03.229 --> 45:06.438
I'm lost.

45:06.439 --> 45:09.389
I'm so lost.

45:24.329 --> 45:26.328
It's Cal. Leave a message.

45:26.329 --> 45:30.228
Cal, where the fuck have you been?

45:30.229 --> 45:31.399
I need you to tell me.

45:34.239 --> 45:37.278
I need you to tell me why
you're sending Eddie on The Walk.
