WEBVTT

00:10.293 --> 00:12.536
AIQaeda isn't a normal enemy force.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.263
It's not going to be like
executing a crime boss.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.127
Fire!

00:17.196 --> 00:19.302
You can't just cut the head
off the snake.

00:19.677 --> 00:21.161
It's more pervasive.

00:22.288 --> 00:25.222
As Saudi citizens...

00:25.618 --> 00:28.555
You can easily acquire US visas.

00:28.742 --> 00:30.954
We've been babysitting
this guy in witness protection

00:30.979 --> 00:32.353
for three friggin' years.

00:32.378 --> 00:34.905
He was with the UBL in Sudan,
one country north.

00:34.938 --> 00:37.423
- He's got no leads for us?
- He's got nothing.

00:37.448 --> 00:39.652
Are you implying that there
is some degradation

00:39.677 --> 00:41.132
- here at the Agency?
- No, sir.

00:41.157 --> 00:42.998
But at times there may be
a lack of momentum.

00:43.023 --> 00:44.655
As I see it,
you're leading Alec Station

00:44.680 --> 00:46.868
into a wild goose chase of absurdity.

00:46.968 --> 00:48.272
Well, you can't fire me, Leonard.

00:48.296 --> 00:49.756
You can move me to the broom closet.

00:49.781 --> 00:51.610
You can make me process
meaningless cables

00:51.635 --> 00:53.577
all day, but you cannot fire me.

00:53.681 --> 00:55.925
The Bureau simply can't cover
what you're spending.

00:56.028 --> 00:58.013
Also, you happen to be in serious debt.

00:58.107 --> 01:00.319
Are you going through
my fucking credit cards?

01:00.486 --> 01:03.864
I definitely want us to be
more than buddies.

01:03.933 --> 01:07.005
I want to take you home. To my place.

01:07.277 --> 01:09.421
Right now, I'm here with you.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.595
And I will keep coming to see you,

01:11.620 --> 01:14.191
and I'll bring you news
of our progress.

01:14.651 --> 01:16.624
- Talk to me.
- Boss, I got nothing.

01:16.757 --> 01:18.361
They fucking closed the blinds

01:18.430 --> 01:20.245
every time I walk by
the conference room.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.624
- What about ToniAnn?
- Same situation.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.099
They treat us like we're
their friggin' hostages.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.082
How old is she now?

01:50.293 --> 01:51.815
Old enough to think she can party

01:51.840 --> 01:54.848
her little ass off
in Times Square for Y2K.

01:55.219 --> 01:56.684
Young enough that she needs Mommy

01:56.709 --> 01:58.780
to buy her the damn plane ticket.

01:59.275 --> 02:01.576
Like I didn't spend
enough this Christmas.

02:04.263 --> 02:07.799
Talking about her little
boyfriend that's going with her

02:07.824 --> 02:08.997
so she'll be safe.

02:09.273 --> 02:12.415
I told her she ain't grown.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.452
And I got to work that night,

02:15.485 --> 02:18.187
so I'll be damned if...

02:21.817 --> 02:23.184
Shit.

02:23.494 --> 02:25.151
What the fuck?

02:45.390 --> 02:47.450
We need backup down here immediately.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.412
We have a suspicious individual,

02:49.437 --> 02:51.348
possible bombmaking supplies.

02:51.441 --> 02:53.236
He just tried to flee the premises.

02:54.711 --> 02:59.924
A tree begins with a seed.
A tree begins with a seed.

03:00.532 --> 03:01.740
A tree...

03:04.363 --> 03:06.365
Security's enhanced and on alert.

03:06.469 --> 03:08.173
Airports, malls, amusement parks,

03:08.198 --> 03:10.197
power plants, water supplies,

03:10.300 --> 03:11.819
and I want to lock down the embassies

03:11.888 --> 03:14.092
in Abuja, Tehran, Sanaa, and Ashgabat.

03:14.146 --> 03:16.582
- Evacuate them?
- No, but I do want to shutter

03:16.639 --> 03:19.224
Tripoli, Rabat, Tunis,
Islamabad, and Damascus.

03:19.397 --> 03:22.341
Blame it on the holidays.
Then we'll reassess.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.899
And get me that report on what
the hell you guys are proposing

03:24.923 --> 03:27.203
- if Y2K blows the energy grid.
- Yes, sir.

03:27.228 --> 03:29.664
- This afternoon.
- You got it.

03:29.908 --> 03:32.012
Anything to add, George?

03:32.474 --> 03:33.703
No.

03:33.772 --> 03:35.146
I'd like to say that covers it,

03:35.171 --> 03:37.086
but when can we ever say that?

03:37.452 --> 03:40.848
We never can say that,
which is why we keep working.

03:55.587 --> 03:57.106
Transit office lost and found?

03:57.209 --> 03:59.200
- Down to the right.
- Thanks.

04:19.195 --> 04:21.370
There it is.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.405
Man, that Palm Pilot's
some expensive shit

04:23.430 --> 04:25.421
to leave lying around.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.451
You got kids? Yeah, two girls.

04:32.555 --> 04:34.167
Man, that's nice.

04:34.381 --> 04:35.602
I love my little man,

04:35.627 --> 04:37.325
but there's just something
about my daughter.

04:37.349 --> 04:38.985
- They're special, right?
- Yeah, they are.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.105
Listen, anyone else
share this office with you?

04:41.165 --> 04:43.807
Nobody comes in here without me.

04:44.104 --> 04:46.741
You legit FBI?
Like for real, for real?

04:47.408 --> 04:48.674
Yeah.

04:48.778 --> 04:51.470
This Y2K shit keeping you
guys crazy like us around here?

04:51.574 --> 04:54.784
You bet. Anybody else handle
this device, besides you?

04:54.853 --> 04:57.047
After we spoke, I just
locked it up in my stuff.

04:57.127 --> 04:59.649
- Nobody touched it?
- I said I locked it up, man.

04:59.736 --> 05:02.102
Okay, okay. It's all good.

05:02.599 --> 05:05.227
Thank you. Here...

05:05.781 --> 05:09.405
buy your daughter something nice.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.746
Nitroglycerine.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.955
LAX.

05:30.592 --> 05:33.340
You're telling me he gave all
that up in one interrogation?

05:33.443 --> 05:34.839
I wish I could tell you

05:34.864 --> 05:36.136
I put my best people on this,

05:36.205 --> 05:38.583
but this guy must have been
dying to confess.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.520
He was petrified at first,
and then he started singing.

05:41.984 --> 05:43.350
Unfuckingbelievable.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.947
The way he
cracked, there's no fuckin' way

05:45.972 --> 05:47.630
he was working alone.

05:48.045 --> 05:50.357
I haven't even given you
the best news yet.

05:50.744 --> 05:53.498
We got a number. A Brooklyn number.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.233
We found it in Ressam's car.

05:55.258 --> 05:57.164
The press knows nothing about this.

05:57.258 --> 06:01.506
7181346827.

06:01.575 --> 06:04.960
Abdul Ghani Meskini.

06:05.847 --> 06:07.572
Meskini.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.860
All right. Thank you.

06:11.229 --> 06:13.402
Officials
with the Clinton administration

06:13.475 --> 06:16.807
say they are quite concerned
that terrorist financier.

06:16.832 --> 06:19.529
Osama Bin Laden has
stepped up his efforts

06:19.554 --> 06:21.668
to attack Americans around the world.

06:21.693 --> 06:23.951
The State Department
recently warned Americans

06:23.976 --> 06:25.695
to stay away from large gatherings

06:25.720 --> 06:27.955
and millennium celebrations abroad.

06:28.015 --> 06:29.883
But with preparations now underway

06:29.908 --> 06:32.502
for big New Year's parties
in major U.S. cities,

06:32.571 --> 06:34.021
the White House today extended

06:34.046 --> 06:36.911
the Y2K warning to American soil.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.086
Occupied.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.897
What do you know
about a guy named Meskini?

06:44.586 --> 06:46.130
Meskini.

06:46.203 --> 06:47.928
Abdul Ghani Meskini.

06:48.173 --> 06:50.900
Meskini. Him, I remember.

06:51.241 --> 06:52.936
Algerian, maybe?

06:53.268 --> 06:54.938
Yes, definitely Algerian.

06:55.042 --> 06:56.733
Can you think of any reason

06:56.802 --> 06:58.623
why Ressam would have been
in touch with him?

06:58.648 --> 07:00.841
Does he make bombs?

07:01.521 --> 07:03.405
- Could be.
- What the fuck does that mean?

07:03.445 --> 07:05.280
Junior, we need to know
if he was helping Ressam

07:05.304 --> 07:06.810
plan the attack on LAX

07:06.856 --> 07:09.188
or if there's another possible
millennium plot underway,

07:09.213 --> 07:10.239
like in New York City,

07:10.264 --> 07:11.767
we need to find out right fucking now.

07:11.791 --> 07:15.852
You have me here, alone,
now over four years.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.633
- It's not to complain...
- I'm not complaining either.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.619
But I'm not sure the American people

07:20.723 --> 07:23.104
are getting their
fucking money's worth yet.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.855
You got the royal treatment here.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.503
Maybe that's the problem.
What do you think, Floyd?

07:27.626 --> 07:30.021
You think maybe a week in Riker's

07:30.046 --> 07:31.364
will help jog his memory?

07:31.389 --> 07:32.879
I know some people
who know some people.

07:32.903 --> 07:34.298
Okay, okay, okay.

07:34.489 --> 07:36.739
Meskini's in New York long time now.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.561
And I can remember, he was good.

07:39.879 --> 07:41.292
Special guy.

07:41.421 --> 07:44.010
Good with making the connections.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.265
Good with money.

07:45.290 --> 07:48.445
A resourceful guy
with connections in New York.

07:48.685 --> 07:53.250
So what, he's an accountant
for the organization?

07:53.424 --> 07:54.769
Could be.

07:54.821 --> 07:59.861
Not sure, but I have different idea.

07:59.984 --> 08:01.606
Maybe you want to hear?

08:01.631 --> 08:03.572
You mean maybe we want
to hear something other than

08:03.596 --> 08:05.908
"could be"? Yes, Junior, please.

08:06.025 --> 08:10.305
I'm thinking that he is here,
making the money

08:10.491 --> 08:12.565
move around.

08:14.503 --> 08:18.887
You think he's funneling
alQaeda money from Brooklyn?

08:18.968 --> 08:20.624
I think.

08:57.209 --> 08:59.297
From Dubai to Kuala Lumpur.

08:59.376 --> 09:01.274
But first I'm coming from Yemen.

09:02.845 --> 09:04.605
Yes, I'm Saudi.

09:07.112 --> 09:10.852
No, it cannot be the Shah airport.

09:11.073 --> 09:12.667
When are you leaving?

09:13.417 --> 09:15.693
I'm not worried about the price,

09:15.718 --> 09:17.131
I'm worried about those expecting

09:17.156 --> 09:18.813
to meet me at Kuala Lumpur Airport.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.198
Hello?

09:32.371 --> 09:34.407
Hello.

09:46.595 --> 09:48.828
A better
question is when do you come back?

09:49.006 --> 09:51.568
Long before our son's arrival.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.089
You mean our daughter's?

09:54.983 --> 09:57.161
Another daughter?

09:59.246 --> 10:00.819
And the men joining you...

10:01.328 --> 10:02.787
Are they... committed?

10:03.380 --> 10:05.721
Is that what worries you?

10:06.358 --> 10:08.582
Nothing worries me, Khalid.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.564
There is a small part of me that wishes

10:11.630 --> 10:13.547
you could serve
without leaving us, but...

10:14.549 --> 10:17.483
I know our reward is coming.

10:39.789 --> 10:42.756
No, it cannot be the Shah Airport.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.850
I'm not worried about the price...

10:44.932 --> 10:46.316
I'm worried about those expecting

10:46.341 --> 10:47.470
to meet me at Kuala Lumpur Airport.

10:47.494 --> 10:50.124
Our friends over at Saudi intelligence

10:50.149 --> 10:52.703
have been keeping an eye on
Mihdhar because he's a citizen,

10:52.728 --> 10:55.731
and he was flagged as being
a member of alQaeda.

10:55.976 --> 10:59.531
Which is why other friends at the NSA

10:59.754 --> 11:03.447
sent this little gift over.

11:03.710 --> 11:06.557
We know now that
he's Hada's soninlaw,

11:06.582 --> 11:10.033
and he and his wife are
expecting their second child.

11:10.245 --> 11:15.301
And we know that he's currently
headed for a hotel in Dubai.

11:16.082 --> 11:18.496
Okay, but to me the question is,

11:18.616 --> 11:22.275
where is headed
after Dubai and Malaysia?

11:23.965 --> 11:25.776
Diane?

12:16.514 --> 12:18.047
Hey.

13:04.831 --> 13:07.203
This guy Meskini's
funneling money from Brooklyn

13:07.228 --> 13:10.059
for some millennium plot?

13:10.084 --> 13:11.534
All he's done the last 12 hours

13:11.559 --> 13:13.701
is watch fucking soccer games.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.061
Diet again?

13:18.151 --> 13:19.705
Regular.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.613
Thanks.

13:36.712 --> 13:38.174
My ass is numb.

13:38.199 --> 13:40.856
I have not had a homecooked
meal in three days,

13:40.921 --> 13:44.051
and I saw ten roaches in the bathroom

13:44.120 --> 13:45.569
the last time I pissed.

13:45.638 --> 13:47.230
Rough times, I know.

13:47.358 --> 13:50.373
Thought it couldn't get no
worse until I started to smell

13:50.400 --> 13:52.367
what just came out of your mouth.

14:16.964 --> 14:18.275
- Yeah.
- Jackson here.

14:18.385 --> 14:19.841
Check your email.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.998
I'm looking at a plane ticket,

14:22.023 --> 14:23.749
a passport, and a U.S. visa,

14:23.834 --> 14:25.764
which means he's coming here.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.706
And if he's coming,
kind of makes you wonder

14:27.731 --> 14:29.387
- who's already there.
- Fucking hell.

14:29.463 --> 14:30.718
Hold on, Jackson.

14:30.799 --> 14:32.042
This is the officer in Dubai.

14:32.091 --> 14:34.257
He says Mihdhar has a U.S. Visa.

14:35.354 --> 14:37.322
- Diane Marsh.
- Mihdhar's flying Dubai

14:37.347 --> 14:40.488
to Kuala Lumpur, and he has
a multiple entry U.S. visa.

14:40.850 --> 14:42.921
Okay, I'll get the Malaysian
special branch

14:42.946 --> 14:44.810
on this immediately.

14:45.039 --> 14:48.387
We're gonna need eyes and ears
in Kuala Lumpur.

15:14.577 --> 15:16.165
You're missing an H.

15:16.386 --> 15:20.839
M-I-H-D-H-A-R.

15:35.183 --> 15:37.496
U.S. Visa ain't gonna mean shit
in a minute.

15:37.605 --> 15:40.401
We'll be all over him before he
can get a foot off the plane.

15:40.426 --> 15:41.819
Knowing O'Neill, it'll be

15:41.844 --> 15:43.683
before he can even get out of Malaysia.

15:43.785 --> 15:46.132
Especially with
all this Y2K shit going on.

15:46.414 --> 15:47.695
How long do you think it'll take Diane

15:47.719 --> 15:49.341
to give us the okay to share?

15:49.598 --> 15:52.585
She'll read it as soon as
you'll let me send.

15:53.544 --> 15:56.685
Any more problems, Captain Spell Check?

15:58.550 --> 16:00.414
Looks good.

16:18.175 --> 16:20.177
My friend...

16:24.521 --> 16:26.178
Welcome to Kuala Lumpur.

17:40.575 --> 17:42.611
New Year's is fucking tomorrow night.

17:42.808 --> 17:45.742
Good to know everyone's taking
this shit seriously.

17:49.697 --> 17:51.941
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.121
Now where's this fucker going?

18:13.782 --> 18:15.128
What are you doing?

18:15.764 --> 18:17.490
It's noon prayers.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.278
I think I'll go to the mosque.

18:19.347 --> 18:22.063
Hey, we don't need you to be a hero.

18:22.098 --> 18:23.545
You don't just break protocol.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.065
We got Murphy and O'Sullivan
on the street.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.875
Two white boys?
That's who we got on this guy?

18:28.948 --> 18:30.628
What has that got to do with anything?

18:30.688 --> 18:32.690
We're not chasing
Italian mobsters anymore.

18:32.813 --> 18:35.313
- You think I don't know that?
- I think you don't.

18:35.472 --> 18:37.568
- Most of you don't get it.
- But you do?

18:37.639 --> 18:40.366
Wasn't born white.
Wasn't raised Catholic.

18:40.688 --> 18:43.730
But I can't keep
watching this guy on TV.

18:44.132 --> 18:45.872
We can do better.

22:29.761 --> 22:32.315
50fucking3, what the fuck?

22:33.940 --> 22:36.460
Hey, I need you to come look
at something right now.

22:36.530 --> 22:38.463
Listen, I promised my therapist

22:38.520 --> 22:40.941
I would eat my breakfast
hot one day this week

22:40.966 --> 22:42.092
before doing any work.

22:42.117 --> 22:43.981
- Toni, the Mihdhar cable...
- Vince.

22:44.018 --> 22:46.192
If you don't let me finish
this ham and cheese croissant

22:46.216 --> 22:50.220
while it's still hot,
I promise I will lose my shit.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.220
Now, what the fuck is going on?

23:07.290 --> 23:08.930
Look.

23:10.381 --> 23:12.147
She read our cable.

23:12.244 --> 23:13.815
Diane read it.

23:13.942 --> 23:16.945
Now look at the Mihdhar cable,
the one from Dubai.

23:17.281 --> 23:20.388
50fucking3 motherfuckin'
people have read it.

23:20.457 --> 23:22.114
And Diane won't answer ours?

23:22.183 --> 23:24.265
There's got to be a reason.

23:24.725 --> 23:27.279
They sent a fucking cable

23:27.356 --> 23:30.255
saying that this guy
is coming into our country,

23:30.280 --> 23:32.799
that he has a Saudi passport
and a U.S. visa.

23:32.824 --> 23:34.776
53 people from the CIA have read it.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.028
We're not sharing this yet?

23:36.053 --> 23:38.001
Vince, you got to trust the process.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.820
Diane will tell us when we can share.

23:41.829 --> 23:44.343
I'm calling O'Neill.

23:45.112 --> 23:46.617
There's a reason for the wall.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.194
There is a reason.

23:48.231 --> 23:49.751
We do not just share this information.

23:49.775 --> 23:51.326
That's not our job.

23:51.441 --> 23:53.616
You want to get fired?
You want to get me fired?

23:53.713 --> 23:55.578
Are you so convinced Alec Station

23:55.610 --> 23:57.578
isn't busy looking
out for Alec Station?

23:57.820 --> 23:59.749
You really think Diane gives a shit

23:59.774 --> 24:01.696
about working with O'Neill and I49?

24:01.721 --> 24:03.478
Why else would they have
stationed us here, then?

24:03.502 --> 24:05.053
That's exactly what
I'm starting to wonder.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.424
Why the fuck did they...

24:09.617 --> 24:12.758
Why the fuck did they bring us here?

24:16.602 --> 24:19.122
George Tenet has testified that this

24:19.318 --> 24:23.115
cable simply fell through the cracks.

24:23.205 --> 24:25.622
He told us under oath

24:25.731 --> 24:28.631
that no one read it

24:28.828 --> 24:31.268
and that he wasn't aware of it.

24:32.247 --> 24:34.146
How do you make sense of that?

24:34.415 --> 24:37.453
I don't have to make sense
of the director's claims.

24:38.158 --> 24:43.422
I know for a fact that
50 to 60 people read the cable.

24:44.908 --> 24:46.979
Think about what that means.

24:47.134 --> 24:49.214
50 to 60 people

24:49.463 --> 24:51.913
and I was never told.

24:52.164 --> 24:55.132
And John O'Neill was never told.

24:55.381 --> 24:56.925
Why?

24:57.625 --> 25:00.351
There is little doubt in my mind.

25:00.522 --> 25:03.732
This had to go all the way up.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.738
Welcome to Los
Angeles International Airport.

25:08.835 --> 25:11.527
Please have your passport
and declaration form ready

25:11.643 --> 25:13.783
as you enter the customs area.

25:35.169 --> 25:37.517
Welcome to America, sir.

25:38.244 --> 25:40.155
Thank you.

25:40.850 --> 25:42.817
Next.

25:51.159 --> 25:52.816
Thank you.

25:54.297 --> 25:55.712
Thank you.

26:27.744 --> 26:29.608
Gulf accents!

26:30.084 --> 26:31.444
Greetings.

26:31.558 --> 26:33.352
I have many brothers in the Gulf.

26:33.745 --> 26:35.332
Where are you from?

26:35.520 --> 26:37.867
I am Saudi, but I live in Yemen.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.234
He's also Saudi.

26:40.513 --> 26:43.170
Are you visiting the States,
or settling in?

26:44.747 --> 26:46.340
A bit of both.

26:46.746 --> 26:48.403
It's always easier to settle in

26:48.428 --> 26:50.499
if you can meet people from home.

26:51.012 --> 26:52.703
Have you lived here long?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.193
It's been a few years for me.

26:54.797 --> 26:56.973
I was lucky enough to find work

26:57.241 --> 26:59.180
with the Saudi Consulate.

27:14.159 --> 27:15.932
Mr. Director.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.336
Mr. Ambassador.

27:20.795 --> 27:22.141
Figs.

27:22.216 --> 27:23.969
- For you and Stephanie.
- Thank you.

27:24.022 --> 27:25.951
- They're from Saudi?
- Of course.

27:26.243 --> 27:28.832
In the desert,
we grow the sweetest fruits.

27:30.127 --> 27:31.819
So...

27:31.955 --> 27:33.612
Mr. Director.

27:33.687 --> 27:35.958
I asked for the privilege
of your company

27:35.991 --> 27:40.596
so as to inform you that
a resolution has been reached.

27:41.046 --> 27:42.944
That problem we recently discussed?

27:43.081 --> 27:45.533
Yes, our problem.

27:45.768 --> 27:47.874
- It's being taken care of.
- Good man.

27:47.986 --> 27:51.092
I had no doubt a solution
would present itself.

27:51.396 --> 27:54.239
My grandfather used to tell me...

27:54.513 --> 27:58.447
"Make distance between yourself
and every dirtiness."

27:59.073 --> 28:02.070
Important advice for men like us.

28:03.035 --> 28:06.107
My grandfather carried a handkerchief.

28:08.631 --> 28:11.254
I hope your wife enjoys the figs.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.745
Where's my guy?

28:30.847 --> 28:33.229
Your guy left his assigned position.

28:33.425 --> 28:35.914
Must have had a good reason.

28:36.512 --> 28:37.996
I figured you'd say that.

28:38.099 --> 28:40.584
After all, what's agency protocol

28:40.609 --> 28:42.750
when you can just play
Cowboys and Indians?

28:42.836 --> 28:46.150
Pretty sure Meskini's from Algeria.

29:02.204 --> 29:03.757
Best to you.

29:03.927 --> 29:05.339
By the way,

29:05.409 --> 29:07.851
that open slot heading up
the New York office?

29:07.911 --> 29:11.224
I just found out Louis Freeh's
D.C. guy got the job.

29:14.374 --> 29:16.190
Yeah.

29:16.452 --> 29:18.972
He's a good guy, Sanchez.

29:19.122 --> 29:21.400
One of the best.

29:26.489 --> 29:28.595
Tell Soufan to come see me.

29:28.813 --> 29:30.573
If you find him.

30:14.492 --> 30:16.460
Hey.

30:49.224 --> 30:50.917
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you.

30:51.618 --> 30:53.482
I'd like to speak
to your esteemed boss.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.896
I saw him at the mosque.

31:05.839 --> 31:07.806
I would like to give to my brothers.

31:09.070 --> 31:10.924
And who are your brothers?

31:11.957 --> 31:13.639
Ressam is my brother.

31:15.259 --> 31:18.055
You know my brother as Abu Reda.

31:25.981 --> 31:27.948
You can decide how to use this.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.657
Welcome to the family.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.422
May God bless you.

31:53.796 --> 31:54.902
With 2 million

31:54.927 --> 31:56.599
expected here before the night is done,

31:56.624 --> 31:58.040
it appears police are doing

31:58.065 --> 32:00.209
everything they can
to be accommodating.

32:00.329 --> 32:03.701
But the 8,000 cops on duty
are not taking any chances.

32:03.769 --> 32:06.900
NYPD helicopters have been
buzzing the Square all day.

32:07.018 --> 32:08.687
Police say security will be tight

32:08.712 --> 32:10.714
even after the ball drops at midnight.

32:10.749 --> 32:12.192
The party here does not end

32:12.232 --> 32:15.200
until just after 6:00 tomorrow morning.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.864
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.046
Soufan! Get in here.

32:44.833 --> 32:47.238
With everything I got going on,

32:48.197 --> 32:50.693
everyone on my ass,

32:51.384 --> 32:54.294
you broke protocol by going
into a mosque?

32:54.468 --> 32:56.271
I went in there to pray.

32:57.201 --> 32:59.699
You left your post yesterday
because you had a sudden urge

32:59.730 --> 33:03.036
to do something I've never
seen you do before, pray?

33:03.095 --> 33:05.742
This may come as a shock to you, boss,

33:06.111 --> 33:08.148
but I'm a Muslim.

33:08.244 --> 33:10.246
It was afternoon prayers.

33:10.315 --> 33:12.973
I went inside, took off my shoes,

33:13.363 --> 33:14.791
and I prayed.

33:14.882 --> 33:16.953
And yeah, I saw Meskini
while I was in there.

33:17.264 --> 33:18.748
But if you really have a problem

33:18.773 --> 33:21.534
with me going
inside of a mosque to pray,

33:21.660 --> 33:23.410
maybe it's because
you never had to think

33:23.435 --> 33:25.403
about the fact
that I'm an actual Muslim.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.682
- Maybe that's the problem.
- Don't you dare.

33:27.742 --> 33:29.488
This is about
working the case the right way

33:29.513 --> 33:31.707
in the very limited
fucking time that we have.

33:31.732 --> 33:33.976
Which means you cannot do this.

33:34.001 --> 33:36.388
Cannot do what? Pray?

33:36.613 --> 33:38.361
Every day, five times a day,

33:38.495 --> 33:40.481
over a billion Muslims pray together.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.298
But you don't want me to do that, ever?

33:43.354 --> 33:45.426
Okay, Ali, okay, I'm not
doing this with you right now.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.866
Okay, pray whenever the fuck you want.

33:48.063 --> 33:49.754
In the meantime,
we have to make a move.

33:49.823 --> 33:52.067
I saw enough to know
that this guy Meskini

33:52.176 --> 33:55.033
knows the whole community,
that he is a mover,

33:55.105 --> 33:56.727
and he's got to be high up there,

33:56.897 --> 33:59.137
maybe a direct connection to Zawahiri.

33:59.281 --> 34:01.835
- He's collecting money for them.
- How do you know that?

34:01.905 --> 34:04.494
- 'Cause I saw.
- You saw?

34:04.696 --> 34:06.379
I introduced myself.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.469
- You what?
- Not by name, I...

34:09.846 --> 34:13.286
Listen, we're on the right track.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.166
But there's got to be so much more

34:15.190 --> 34:16.779
to this guy that we don't know.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.295
I just need a few days

34:18.321 --> 34:20.841
to figure out exactly where he fits in.

34:21.022 --> 34:23.369
You know this is
the tip of the iceberg.

34:23.552 --> 34:26.356
One of the guys that you want to follow

34:26.467 --> 34:28.860
could just be about ready
to pull another Ressam,

34:28.885 --> 34:30.679
except he'll be successful,

34:30.735 --> 34:34.135
and he'll be at the biggest,
most fucking congested party

34:34.159 --> 34:35.704
in the world.

34:35.780 --> 34:39.056
So that's it? Fuck the big picture?

34:39.081 --> 34:40.289
You know we've got

34:40.313 --> 34:42.589
14 goddamn hours to stop these guys

34:42.614 --> 34:44.099
if they're gonna do something.

34:44.168 --> 34:47.391
We're not gonna get them
your way, not in time.

34:48.706 --> 34:51.123
Get out of my office.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.734
Fuck it.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.801
All right, kids, clock's run
out on our Brooklyn friends.

35:24.826 --> 35:26.738
Arrest everybody we got leads on.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.758
Connected to Meskini or not.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.114
We're shutting this
the fuck down today.

35:31.185 --> 35:33.773
And Soufan, make the arrests.

35:34.016 --> 35:36.674
Then you can sit tonight out.

35:45.011 --> 35:47.220
- FBI, let me see your hands!
- Put your hands up.

35:47.537 --> 35:48.977
- Turn around.
- Up against the wall!

35:49.021 --> 35:50.421
Turn around. Up against the window.

35:50.499 --> 35:52.264
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Turn around!

35:52.289 --> 35:54.188
Don't try anything.

35:59.484 --> 36:01.590
- FBI, let me see your hands.
- Let's go.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.632
- Come on.
- Stand up, stand up.

36:07.058 --> 36:08.410
FBI.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.786
Sit down! I need you to sit down.

38:27.104 --> 38:29.037
Five... four...

38:29.062 --> 38:32.031
three... two... one...

38:55.419 --> 38:57.559
And there'd be, like,
photos of him everywhere

38:58.383 --> 39:01.869
and videos, and his clothes.

39:01.938 --> 39:03.156
Like a museum.

39:03.181 --> 39:05.976
Except you get to, like,
smoke and be naked inside.

39:07.699 --> 39:09.806
You're here.
Why didn't you come find me?

39:09.901 --> 39:11.501
Hey.

39:12.694 --> 39:14.357
You look like you need rescuing.

39:26.766 --> 39:28.261
Hey, you know I like you, but

39:28.286 --> 39:30.046
I'm not sure about your friends.

39:30.128 --> 39:32.303
Hey.

39:32.547 --> 39:34.823
Those are my neighbors, not my friends.

39:35.171 --> 39:36.857
And they smoke way too much weed.

39:36.902 --> 39:38.444
I noticed.

39:38.832 --> 39:41.283
I noticed that you said you like me.

39:41.792 --> 39:43.480
When did that happen?

39:43.675 --> 39:46.022
Sometime between "Where's Waldo"

39:46.264 --> 39:49.334
and, that thing
you did the other night.

39:49.385 --> 39:51.525
- What thing?
- You know what thing.

39:51.876 --> 39:53.429
That thing.

39:53.532 --> 39:54.950
Yeah.

40:01.052 --> 40:02.605
Happy New Year.

40:02.829 --> 40:04.761
Happy New Year, beautiful.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.814
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:17.861 --> 40:19.767
- To you.
- Happy New Year, Floyd.

40:19.822 --> 40:21.272
Happy New Year.

40:21.862 --> 40:25.002
To twotriple.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.444
I think... I think I'm
gonna be in my prime this year.

40:27.494 --> 40:29.161
- Really? Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:29.186 --> 40:30.668
- I think... I think...
- Why do you think that?

40:30.692 --> 40:32.194
- You think that?
- Hey.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.686
You guys can get on out of here.

40:35.055 --> 40:37.644
Welcome to a new century, fellas.

40:40.113 --> 40:41.770
All right, boss.

40:41.926 --> 40:44.192
Hey, Vince, you need a ride uptown?

40:44.844 --> 40:47.791
No, I'm gonna hang here
for a minute.

40:48.867 --> 40:50.566
All right.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.839
Happy New Year, y'all.

40:52.995 --> 40:56.136
Yeah, happy New Year. Take care, Floyd.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.453
Boss.

41:04.598 --> 41:06.600
I think there's something
you should know.

41:14.077 --> 41:16.324
I was gonna say...

41:17.902 --> 41:20.163
you can relax now.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.200
The bad guys lost tonight.

41:25.841 --> 41:28.671
Vince, tell me honestly.

41:28.801 --> 41:30.872
What is it we did here?

41:31.035 --> 41:32.542
What are you talking about?

41:32.717 --> 41:34.098
We stopped them.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.468
We won.

41:35.807 --> 41:37.568
We won?

41:40.262 --> 41:42.782
I'm telling you,
it's like whackamole.

41:46.479 --> 41:48.550
They're here.

41:48.668 --> 41:50.497
They're here in America.

41:50.685 --> 41:53.205
They're in London and Afghanistan.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.144
They're in Kenya, Tanzania.

41:57.455 --> 41:59.323
And we...

42:03.196 --> 42:06.233
We have no idea what we're up against.

42:26.315 --> 42:28.221
Well, our broadcast
is coming to an end.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.837
I should remind you that if you,

42:29.862 --> 42:31.334
if you want to see more of it,
and some of it

42:31.358 --> 42:32.745
has been fantastic
from around the world,

42:32.769 --> 42:35.766
Sam Donaldson will be on duty
at 8:00 eastern time...

42:35.815 --> 42:38.270
I was tempted to say tomorrow
but I really mean today...

42:38.295 --> 42:41.850
From Washington for a broadcast
called "Dawn of a New Era."

42:41.948 --> 42:44.581
And he will have all
of the great highlights

42:44.606 --> 42:46.510
that we've seen touches of
in the last few minutes

42:46.534 --> 42:47.967
from around the world.

42:48.072 --> 42:49.882
And just before we leave,
some absolutely unplanned,

42:49.906 --> 42:51.045
unrehearsed comments.

42:51.089 --> 42:53.091
I feel a little bit,
as I think a lot of us do,

42:53.116 --> 42:55.057
like the people that were
entering the 20th century

42:55.081 --> 42:56.956
100 years ago with great fascination

42:56.988 --> 42:58.990
that we were on the edge of the unknown

42:59.015 --> 43:01.385
and, because there was so much
yet to be known,

43:01.410 --> 43:04.517
a real hunger to know more
and a certain trepidation.

43:04.679 --> 43:06.882
They were coming
into the technological age

43:06.907 --> 43:09.530
and we now go into
a new technological age.

43:09.555 --> 43:11.348
There'll be lots of time
in the days ahead

43:11.373 --> 43:13.685
to revisit all of the commentary

43:13.710 --> 43:15.471
that has been offered up
about the millennium

43:15.496 --> 43:18.611
in the last several days
and weeks and months.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.361
I remind myself of only one
thing at the end of this thing

43:22.391 --> 43:24.507
and it's what one
of our great futurists...

43:24.532 --> 43:26.516
We do have futurists, you know.

43:26.541 --> 43:28.040
At the end of the 20th century said,

43:28.065 --> 43:30.689
"Remember when you put
the known and the unknown

43:30.714 --> 43:32.925
"into a computer, the unpredictable

43:32.950 --> 43:35.058
always outweighs the predictable."

43:35.336 --> 43:39.859
So the future is exciting,
and it is uncertain.
