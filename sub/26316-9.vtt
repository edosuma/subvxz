- Hello!
- Hello.

00:57.934 --> 01:01.312
Hope we have the right house.
I'm looking for a Doug Forcett?

01:01.729 --> 01:02.772
I'm Doug Forcett.

01:03.398 --> 01:06.067
Wow! Oh, yes... yes, you are.

01:06.401 --> 01:07.402
Sorry, um...

01:07.485 --> 01:10.864
I'm a reporter
for the Calgary Times Examiner.

01:10.947 --> 01:13.700
- Oh.
- My name is, uh, Michael Scoop.

01:13.867 --> 01:17.287
- Mm-hm?
- This is my photographer, Janet... Scoop.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.831
- She's my sister. We're the Scoops.
- Oh, boy.

01:19.998 --> 01:23.918
Some... some people in town are saying
you live a pretty interesting life out here

01:24.085 --> 01:26.421
growing your own food,
completely off the grid...

01:26.629 --> 01:27.964
- Mm.
- We would love to do

01:28.047 --> 01:30.842
a human-interest story about you
for the paper.

01:30.925 --> 01:31.801
What do you say?

01:31.885 --> 01:33.595
O-OK, let me think...

01:34.345 --> 01:37.724
Well, first off, I'm so flattered
that you'd want to do a whole news story

01:37.807 --> 01:39.893
just about me, that's so nice!

01:40.059 --> 01:42.061
Heartfelt thanks to the whole Scoop family.

01:42.729 --> 01:46.191
Can I ask, is your newspaper printed
on recycled paper?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.401
Yes. Yeah, no, very recycled. The most.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.403
Alright then, come on in!

01:50.528 --> 01:53.198
Great! Great. Uh, hey, you know,
before we forget

01:53.698 --> 01:55.825
can Janet take a photo
of you for the paper?

01:56.034 --> 01:57.285
Oh...

01:57.410 --> 01:59.913
OK, can you look up a little,
and to the right?

02:00.288 --> 02:03.499
Smile, but only with your mouth
and not your eyes?

02:03.917 --> 02:04.959
Perfect.

02:11.424 --> 02:13.051
It was 1972.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.304
Uh, my friend Randy and I ate
some magic mushrooms.

02:16.512 --> 02:19.599
Randy asked me,
"What do you think happens when you die?"

02:19.766 --> 02:24.270
And I saw, with perfect clarity,
how the afterlife works.

02:25.021 --> 02:28.274
Immediately, I knew I had to live
a perfect life.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.443
Well, not immediately.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.029
The next day,
all I could do was watch kung fu movies

02:33.071 --> 02:35.615
and stroke a blanket
that I thought was my cat.

02:36.032 --> 02:38.576
But soon after, I designed a life

02:38.868 --> 02:42.914
that would maximize my point total
and help me get into the Good Place

02:43.122 --> 02:44.874
- and I've been living it ever since.
- Mm.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.670
- I know this sounds crazy.
- No! No, actually, it makes...

02:49.003 --> 02:50.630
- it makes perfect sense.
- Oh!

02:52.548 --> 02:54.592
Oh, boy, you've been sitting here
for ten minutes

02:54.676 --> 02:56.552
and I haven't offered you anything
to eat or drink.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.554
- Oh...
- Would you like some water?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.973
Or fresh radishes?

03:00.306 --> 03:01.391
Water'd be great.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.229
Janet! How cool is he?

03:06.312 --> 03:08.022
You know, for a celebrity

03:08.106 --> 03:12.902
he's amazingly down-to-earth.
Stars, they really are just like us.

03:13.027 --> 03:17.282
He's so thoughtful with his actions.
Thank goodness he had that hallucination.

03:17.657 --> 03:20.660
He could've had the one Randy had,
where everything was made of ears.

03:20.827 --> 03:23.621
- Way less helpful.
- We have to learn everything we can

03:23.746 --> 03:26.874
about what makes him tick
so we can use it to help others.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.669
He is the blueprint, Janet.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.463
He figured it all out.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.632
Here we go - two waters.

03:34.841 --> 03:36.467
Let me know if you're not happy with them.

03:36.634 --> 03:40.346
I have ice cubes if it's too warm,
and a Koozie if it's too cold.

03:42.432 --> 03:46.019
Oh...
Boy, that has an interesting aftertaste.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.270
Is that from a nearby river?

03:47.353 --> 03:50.773
Oh, no. Why take fresh water away
from the beavers and the fish?

03:51.107 --> 03:53.568
- Ah...
- No, I have my composting toilet

03:53.609 --> 03:55.528
hooked up to a water filtration system.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.656
One man's waste is another man's water.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.325
- Mm.
- And both men are me!

04:01.909 --> 04:02.785
Hm, hm.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.331
I'm pretty excited to
relax and have a drink.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.542
I mean, saving souls feels great,
but Sydney to Budapest

04:09.709 --> 04:11.753
to Phoenix to Calgary...

04:11.836 --> 04:14.172
I'm so jet-lagged,
I can't even "regrender" my "chorf."

04:15.590 --> 04:17.925
Don't even know what I was trying to say.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.928
You need to get your blood flowing.
There's a pool table over there.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.139
- Wanna play?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

04:23.181 --> 04:24.140
Let's do it.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.480
Tahani, can I ask your advice
about something?

04:30.563 --> 04:32.023
Is it about your grating speaking voice?

04:32.273 --> 04:35.109
I'm so glad you finally brought it up,
because honestly

04:35.193 --> 04:38.029
- with a few elocution lessons...
- No, I want to ask you about Chidi.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.322
What's wrong with my voice?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.450
Nothing! It's lovely!

04:42.825 --> 04:43.910
Tell me about Chidi!

04:44.619 --> 04:47.997
So, it must get lonely up here
all by yourself without anyone to talk to?

04:48.122 --> 04:51.793
Oh, I've got lots of friends.
There's this little guy, for example.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.170
Yeah, it's a snail.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.381
Hi, snail! I don't name them

04:56.547 --> 04:58.466
in case they already
have a name they prefer.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.928
- Huh.
- So, this is an organic garden?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.430
Yeah. Everything I eat, I grow myself.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.266
The radish patch was actually here
when I moved in.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.893
I thought it'd be mean to dig it up.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.187
- Mean... to the radishes?
- Mm.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.732
I also grow lentils,
because they require very little water

05:14.982 --> 05:17.026
- and have the smallest carbon footprint.
- Huh.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.029
All he consumes are lentils and radishes.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.198
No, Janet. He also consumes...

05:22.532 --> 05:23.574
his own waste.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.326
So. Everything's fine.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.163
How do you play pool again?
What are the rules?

05:29.372 --> 05:32.125
That's one of the best things about pool,
dawg! There are no rules.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.835
I am 100% sure there are.

05:34.085 --> 05:36.629
Me and my friends play a special
Jacksonville style of pool.

05:36.838 --> 05:38.881
It's called
"Special Jacksonville-style pool."

05:39.173 --> 05:42.260
You hit whatever ball you want,
but you use your hands.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.095
And that's it.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.350
OK, your turn. I got a thousand points.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.853
Oh - that's the other rule.
You make up your own points.

05:53.896 --> 05:54.981
I got five million points.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.775
Damn! How'd you get so
good at this so fast?

05:58.443 --> 06:04.198
So, in this whole other timeline,
Chidi and I said "I love you" to each other.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.577
But he doesn't remember
any of that happened.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.288
So, I guess my question is

06:10.580 --> 06:13.332
when is the right time to tell someone
you were passionate lovers

06:13.416 --> 06:16.210
in an alternate timeline in the afterlife,
but he doesn't remember

06:16.294 --> 06:20.047
because technically none of that "happened"
in this strand of the multi-verse?

06:20.548 --> 06:21.674
You know what?

06:21.716 --> 06:23.968
I'll just check with Yahoo answers,
I'm sure someone's weighed in.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.929
No, no.
I'm flattered you would seek my advice

06:27.555 --> 06:29.765
though I suppose it makes sense.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.143
I'm sure the one constant
in all the reboots

06:32.185 --> 06:33.853
was that you and I were best friends.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.646
Uh-huh. Yep. Mm-hm.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.442
Look, I don't think you would want
Chidi to know

06:39.525 --> 06:41.027
what happened in the past

06:41.319 --> 06:43.821
unless you wanted it to happen again
in the present.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.283
You can't know how Chidi will react.

06:47.492 --> 06:52.288
It may be painful, but it's never a
bad idea to tell someone how you feel.

06:53.289 --> 06:54.332
Thanks, Tahani.

06:54.665 --> 06:55.833
You give really good advice.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.377
And you made a really hot centaur.

06:58.961 --> 06:59.837
Sorry?

07:00.296 --> 07:04.300
So, these are some of my 71
adopted dogs and wolves.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.137
You've rescued every stray animal
that's ever wandered onto your property?

07:08.304 --> 07:11.057
Oh, yes, ma'am!
I've been mauled several times.

07:11.516 --> 07:13.392
Uh, this little guy here...

07:13.476 --> 07:15.895
might look innocent, but, boy,
he goes right for the squeaker

07:15.978 --> 07:17.563
if you know what I mean.

07:17.647 --> 07:20.358
Oh, this is fun. You get to meet Raymond.
Hi, Raymond!

07:20.441 --> 07:22.360
Hi, dumdum.
Who are these two hosers?

07:22.693 --> 07:25.488
Don't worry about Raymond,
he's just a local sociopath

07:25.571 --> 07:27.782
who comes by my house
to take advantage of me.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.785
I've got your laundry all folded
and ready for you.

07:30.910 --> 07:34.830
For whatever reason, this loser
does whatever you tell him to do - watch.

07:34.914 --> 07:36.040
Hey, give that guy your shoe!

07:36.999 --> 07:38.292
Would that make you happy?

07:38.459 --> 07:39.627
- Very happy.
- Oh...

07:39.710 --> 07:41.879
- Now, give him your shoe.
- Oh, that's OK, Doug.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.507
Don't... I don't need your shoe.
Please don't give me your shoe.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.801
OK, well, then give me your shoe
or I'll be sad.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.011
There you are.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.057
Well, as long as he's happy.

07:53.349 --> 07:56.852
See, if I make him happy, I get the points.
That's how the system works, remember?

07:57.061 --> 07:58.479
Go get your shoe, idiot!

07:58.604 --> 08:00.064
Be right back.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.148
Ow.

08:01.357 --> 08:02.400
Oh, that's a bleeder.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.026
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.740
Michael, face facts. Doug is not
the "blueprint" of how to live a good life.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.367
He's become a happiness pump.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.326
What?

08:12.451 --> 08:13.703
Remember, from Chidi's lessons?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.454
I remember the term "happiness pump".

08:15.913 --> 08:19.625
That's just mostly because Eleanor and
Jason made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.961
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.

08:22.253 --> 08:25.339
A happiness pump is someone
who is obsessed with maximising

08:25.423 --> 08:27.383
the overall good, at his or her expense.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.262
Doug will do literally anything
to make other people happy

08:31.345 --> 08:32.805
even if it makes him miserable.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.890
Oh, I don't think he's miserable.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.436
So, everyone happy and contented in here?

08:38.853 --> 08:39.937
- What's--
- Oh.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.815
I volunteer to test cosmetics
for a local company

08:42.898 --> 08:44.483
so they don't have to test on animals.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.651
- It's fun!
- Ah.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.403
For the animals who don't have to do it.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.989
For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire!

08:50.281 --> 08:51.699
Uh, what can I do for you now?

08:51.991 --> 08:55.286
Would you like to move in permanently
or would either of you like any more water

08:55.369 --> 08:56.954
- or one of my kidneys?
- You know what?

08:57.079 --> 08:58.706
We have absolutely everything we need.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.583
Thank you. Uh, we're gonna head out now.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.961
OK, well, it was so nice to meet
you, Janet, and you, Mark.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.088
- I mean, Michael.
- Huh.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.674
I called you Mark.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.760
- Your name is Michael.
- No, no, that's OK.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.428
Hey, hey, stay with me here, buddy.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.347
No, no, no, no, this is very bad.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.308
Forgetting someone's name,
that's definitely lost me some points.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.311
Hey, you know, I've always secretly wished
my name was Mark.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.937
Lie!

09:22.021 --> 09:23.147
- That's a lie.
- Oh...

09:23.356 --> 09:25.816
Now I'm accusing you of lying!
And now I'm yelling.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.984
Why am I yelling?

09:27.151 --> 09:30.571
I need to make this up.
I'm gonna give you a really nice haircut!

09:32.865 --> 09:34.992
- Was that...?
- The snail? Yeah.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.577
Yeah, that was a snai... ooh.

09:36.661 --> 09:38.788
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

09:39.205 --> 09:40.331
I think he's still alive.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.626
Do either of you know anything
about snail first-aid?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.211
- No.
- Yes. I mean "no."

09:45.336 --> 09:47.588
Alright, Michael,
I need you to find some scotch tape

09:47.755 --> 09:49.131
while I apply pressure.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.468
Too much pressure!
I'm gonna need that tape!

09:54.387 --> 09:55.680
Oh! What?

09:55.763 --> 09:59.725
Jacksonville style, baby!
30 million... points?

09:59.892 --> 10:00.893
Nice one, homie!

10:01.143 --> 10:02.603
Hey, what are you guys doing?

10:02.728 --> 10:06.107
Well, I either know exactly what I'm doing,
and it's something

10:06.273 --> 10:08.109
or we're doing nothing, and I'm winning!

10:08.442 --> 10:10.861
Congrats.
Um, can I talk to you for a second?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.572
OK, uh, a few days ago

10:14.657 --> 10:16.075
Michael showed me something.

10:16.826 --> 10:20.287
And I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

10:20.746 --> 10:22.707
you and I are...

10:25.418 --> 10:26.335
Bambadjan?

10:29.004 --> 10:31.757
You know, I never thought about it before,
but yeah, we are kinda Bambadjan.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.592
No, you jet-lagged doof.

10:33.843 --> 10:37.388
Bambadjan is the name of a demon
from the Bad Place

10:37.471 --> 10:39.890
who is somehow right over there.

10:44.437 --> 10:45.438
Come with me.

10:45.563 --> 10:46.772
- Right now.
- OK, OK.

10:47.148 --> 10:50.276
Hey, guys, having fun? Cool, cool, cool,
so we need to get out of here immediately

10:50.401 --> 10:51.819
because this bar is full of demons.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.071
Eleanor, just because these people
are wearing cheap leather

10:54.155 --> 10:56.073
and stonewashed denim,
they're still part of the Queen's realm.

10:56.157 --> 10:57.700
Calling them "demons" is a bit much.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.703
No, no, no, no, no, actual demons,
like, from the Bad Place.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.872
OK, Chidi and I
are gonna go out the side door.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.081
You and Tahani go out the back.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.500
Or we do this the old-fashioned way.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.669
- How did you make that so fast?
- Bortle--

11:11.005 --> 11:12.882
Mm... Mm...

11:15.259 --> 11:17.511
Hello, idiots. Surprised to see me?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.182
Right, you don't remember.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.101
I'm Shawn. You are very scared of me.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.645
Now, where's Michael?

11:27.772 --> 11:29.148
We are here to celebrate the life

11:29.231 --> 11:32.067
of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore,
the snail.

11:32.401 --> 11:37.281
I named him-her that posthumously,
because I imagine him-her

11:37.364 --> 11:41.660
to be the greatest and most talented snail
ever to have lived.

11:44.497 --> 11:46.373
Michael, would you care to say a few words?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.961
Oh, you're serious. Yes, um, OK.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.089
Martin was a lot of things...

11:54.924 --> 11:56.425
a snail, mostly

11:56.759 --> 11:58.010
but also a friend.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.848
Martin taught us about life, about love

12:03.641 --> 12:07.520
and about... the limits of scotch tape.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.857
Goodbye, Martin.
Happy, slimy trails, old friend.

12:13.484 --> 12:15.277
I'm sorry, I've got to leave right away.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.824
I've decided to make a donation
to the Canadian Mollusc Association

12:20.074 --> 12:21.325
in Martin's honour.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.203
Their office is in Edmonton,
so it will take me...

12:24.703 --> 12:26.997
about three weeks
to walk there and back.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.624
So, take care.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.209
OK, look out, little fellas.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.710
Heads up.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.255
- Here comes a shoe.
- Say, Doug... look.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.882
Do you mind if we ask you
just a few more questions?

12:38.175 --> 12:40.344
What you're doing here,
how you're living your life

12:40.970 --> 12:42.263
- it's just so wonderful.
- Mm.

12:42.555 --> 12:44.431
But can I maybe give you
just a little advice?

12:44.515 --> 12:46.559
I know I should donate more blood.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.521
I'll try, but the last time I went
down there they said I was so anaemic

12:50.646 --> 12:52.106
they ended up giving me blood.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.691
No, look, look. Um...

12:55.359 --> 12:59.405
I've been a reporter for a long time, Doug.
Met all sorts of people.

12:59.905 --> 13:06.245
Travelled all over this crazy blue marble,
meetin' regular folks.

13:06.871 --> 13:09.665
Every face tells a story, Doug.

13:10.291 --> 13:14.420
Why, I'd say that those so-called
"regular" folks often turn out to be

13:14.503 --> 13:16.130
not so regular after all.

13:16.297 --> 13:17.464
- Michael.
- Sorry.

13:17.548 --> 13:21.468
The point is,
I have never met anyone so dedicated

13:21.552 --> 13:25.389
to making other people and...
and snails, happy.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.516
- Huh!
- If what you're saying is true

13:27.600 --> 13:31.937
about the afterlife, then you must've
earned more than enough points by now.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.440
So, loosen up, bud, you know?

13:34.523 --> 13:37.860
Have a little fun.
Eat something besides lentils!

13:38.110 --> 13:40.446
- Like radishes?
- No, no, Doug, damn it.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.699
You know, just have ice cream,
or chicken parm...

13:43.866 --> 13:45.284
Live your life, you know.

13:45.367 --> 13:49.163
Travel. Drink regular water
that wasn't inside you.

13:49.622 --> 13:51.624
OK, just relax.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.668
- Thank you, Michael.
- Mm.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.796
But, no, I can't do any of those things.

13:58.756 --> 14:00.633
- Why not?
- Because I can't risk it.

14:01.842 --> 14:07.139
There's an Accountant, out there somewhere,
measuring the value of everything I do.

14:07.723 --> 14:12.394
What if I "relax," and do something
that loses me just enough points

14:12.478 --> 14:16.273
to keep me out of the Good Place,
and I'm tortured for eternity?

14:17.232 --> 14:19.610
No, I... I have to make every moment count.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.029
It's the only rational way to live.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.574
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to walk to Edmonton

14:25.658 --> 14:28.452
to give $85 to a snail charity.

14:30.955 --> 14:33.374
Why don't you just take us
to the Bad Place already, dude?

14:33.582 --> 14:36.126
Because I wanna see the look on Michael's
face when he realises he failed.

14:36.377 --> 14:38.295
I love seeing the look on people's faces.

14:38.379 --> 14:39.755
It's the best part of my job.

14:40.089 --> 14:42.174
Dude, Michael's not coming here.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.510
Face it, man, you are outmatched

14:44.885 --> 14:47.012
because Michael and Janet are brilliant

14:47.179 --> 14:50.641
and savvy, and they've been ten steps
ahead of you this whole time.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.643
We can sit here as long as you want

14:53.185 --> 14:56.230
but you will never, ever, ever...

14:56.355 --> 14:58.899
see Michael or Janet agai--

14:58.941 --> 15:01.443
Yikes, that was rough! Total bust.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.571
Ugh! Doug is a complete disaster.

15:04.697 --> 15:06.407
And I drank his piss.

15:07.658 --> 15:08.826
Hello, Michael.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.871
See? See the look on his face?

15:13.288 --> 15:14.248
So great.

15:17.376 --> 15:21.088
Hello, Shawn. Other demons.
What are you all doing down here?

15:21.213 --> 15:22.965
What do you think we're doing,
you haemorrhoid?

15:23.132 --> 15:24.967
We're ending this
charade, once and for all.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.845
These four humans are the legal property
of the Bad Place.

15:27.970 --> 15:28.929
That's where we're taking them.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.807
And you.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.476
If you want them,
you're gonna have to go through me.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.811
That's the idea.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.730
Well, it's a bad idea.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.107
Oh, Michael. When will you ever learn...

15:40.149 --> 15:41.442
Screw this! Let's fight!

15:46.196 --> 15:47.406
Get somewhere safe, you guys!

15:48.490 --> 15:49.700
Bad news!

15:50.159 --> 15:52.119
I've been going to the gym a lot!

15:52.745 --> 15:53.662
- Oh, no!
- Chidi!

15:54.246 --> 15:56.582
What is happening?

15:56.957 --> 15:58.208
I don't know!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.252
No! Let him go!

16:01.962 --> 16:03.338
Oh!

16:05.966 --> 16:06.884
Let him go!

16:07.384 --> 16:09.136
Twelve years of fencing. <i>En garde!</i>

16:12.639 --> 16:14.516
Obviously,
I'd never do that in a competition.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.977
That'd be a three-tenths deduction!

16:19.104 --> 16:20.105
No, no! Watch out! Watch out!

16:27.988 --> 16:30.282
I've never marbleised a Janet before!

16:32.451 --> 16:34.828
Jacksonville Style, baby! 2,000 points!

16:35.162 --> 16:36.038
Thanks, Jason.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.792
Janet! Door!

16:49.009 --> 16:50.302
Ha!

16:58.602 --> 16:59.978
Yes!

17:05.150 --> 17:06.318
Ha-ha!

17:07.152 --> 17:08.821
Three hundred points! Best score ever!

17:13.617 --> 17:15.869
Is it just me or is Janet
a straight-up hottie right now?

17:16.078 --> 17:18.205
How are you this close to being
dragged to hell

17:18.288 --> 17:19.790
- and still horny?
- I don't know.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.000
And how did you know they were demons?

17:22.918 --> 17:24.378
Ugh, I can't tell you that now!

17:24.837 --> 17:27.714
Screw it, what am I waiting for?
We could die in the next 30 seconds.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.552
So, Michael showed me a memory
of our time in the Good Place

17:32.177 --> 17:35.514
and you and I were, like... a thing...

17:35.639 --> 17:36.890
- and...
- Ha! Gotcha!

17:38.016 --> 17:39.268
Not like a casual

17:39.351 --> 17:41.311
"Hey, I found two loose pills
in the bottom of my tote

17:41.395 --> 17:43.105
let's pop 'em and see what's good"
kinda thing.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.773
We were in love.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.861
And there's a real possibility that
I'm in love with you, again

17:49.570 --> 17:51.905
here, on this plane of existence

17:52.030 --> 17:54.700
uh, today, now... in Canada...

17:55.284 --> 17:57.661
during this brawl... with demons.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.498
Whoa!

18:01.874 --> 18:02.833
Let's get her to the door!

18:05.919 --> 18:07.129
No, no!

18:09.131 --> 18:10.215
Oh, cool...

18:10.382 --> 18:13.635
when I'm even partway through the door
to the afterlife, my powers come back!

18:13.677 --> 18:14.553
They do?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.058
They do. Thanks for asking!

18:25.063 --> 18:26.481
You're coming with me!

18:28.275 --> 18:29.276
Hi there.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.875
We did it!

18:45.292 --> 18:47.502
- Oh... um...
- Well, no, no, no, of course.

18:47.628 --> 18:50.130
Of course, Janet did it, yes.
But I had the, uh...

18:51.882 --> 18:52.925
Thank you, Janet.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.721
How did you get down here?

18:57.930 --> 19:00.140
We have the only key to the door to Earth.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.768
- We built our own door.
- That's impossible.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.729
"That's impossible, eh!"
Ugh, you're such a dweeb.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.356
Why can't you leave us alone?

19:07.439 --> 19:10.067
You don't have enough nostrils
to stuff with wasps?

19:10.150 --> 19:13.904
I don't want just any wasp-nostrils.
I want these wasp-nostrils.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.031
You're just delaying the
inevitable, Michael.

19:16.365 --> 19:18.659
The Bad Place
is going to get all of them eventually.

19:18.951 --> 19:20.994
These four, their loved ones

19:21.245 --> 19:23.664
even your precious
pee-pee king Doug Forcett.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.582
Now, why would you think that?

19:25.791 --> 19:26.917
Just a hunch.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.795
And do you want to know
what else I had a hunch about?

19:29.878 --> 19:31.213
No.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.343
I mean, why let the guy
keep saying mean stuff, right?

19:36.426 --> 19:39.846
I thought Doug Forcett was the "blueprint"
for leading a good life?

19:39.930 --> 19:43.100
He seems pretty confident that Doug
is heading to the Bad Place.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.855
For a while now, I have felt like
there was something wrong

19:48.939 --> 19:51.775
with how the points system
was evaluating humans.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.861
At first, I thought it was that
the system didn't allow

19:54.945 --> 19:57.114
for the possibility that people
could improve.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.617
That's why I convinced the Judge
to send you back to Earth

20:00.701 --> 20:02.703
so you could confront the ways
you were living.

20:03.036 --> 20:08.542
But now, I'm worried that the problems
with the system might be much more serious.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.045
We need to gather some real evidence.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.424
Uh, sorry, no, no, uh...
Michael, you're confused.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.135
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.

20:18.218 --> 20:23.598
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy,
or you go to jail.

20:23.849 --> 20:27.352
Jason, quick. I-I need that coaster
over there behind the pillar.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.687
You got it, boss!

20:29.896 --> 20:32.024
I... I just needed a... a 30-second break.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.025
Yeah.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.985
What sort of evidence is this
and how do we get it?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.404
Janet and I have to go right to the source

20:37.487 --> 20:39.740
of the points themselves,
the Accountant's office.

20:39.990 --> 20:43.368
Four of you, stay here at Doug Forcett's
house until I get back.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.455
You're gonna need to feed all the dogs
and the wolves

20:46.788 --> 20:49.374
and if a teenager shows up on a dirt-bike

20:49.458 --> 20:51.543
just do as he says, he's very scary.

20:51.710 --> 20:52.919
Michael, Michael, Michael!

20:53.295 --> 20:55.589
I forgot what you asked me to get.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.424
That's OK, bud. Thanks anyway.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.134
Look, we won't be long

20:59.217 --> 21:01.345
and you guys should be safe here.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.387
Actually, scratch that.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.307
We're all screwed because
a bunch more demons just showed up.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.892
- Oh!
- There's too many of 'em.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.685
- What do we do?
- I have an idea.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.229
I think I can take you into my void.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.814
Cool, that sounds fun,
let's go into a void!

21:12.898 --> 21:14.483
OK, let's go.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.694
But just to be clear,
I don't know if you'll survive in my void

21:17.778 --> 21:20.697
but either way, all of you will
definitely die on Earth when I do this

21:20.781 --> 21:21.823
so look around and say goodbye!

21:22.032 --> 21:24.242
Goodbye, Earth!
Wait, did you just say we're gonna di--
