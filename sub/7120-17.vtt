WEBVTT

00:08.015 --> 00:08.892
Oh, fudge.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.327
What time is it?

00:10.385 --> 00:13.559
I got to go to Veggie Village
for the Annual Technology Fair.

00:13.621 --> 00:15.828
Will you all watch my
Princess plant for me?

00:15.890 --> 00:18.235
I usually hire a
sitter, but, eh!

00:18.294 --> 00:19.500
Of course, Princess.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.562
Awesome.

00:20.596 --> 00:21.631
Thank you, Finn.

00:21.697 --> 00:23.506
I will be back on the Morrow.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.774
Screeeee!

00:29.773 --> 00:31.446
You're in good hands,
Princess Plant.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.761 --> 00:51.072
"And then the monster got
punched in the head,

00:51.131 --> 00:53.441
and the Princess was safe.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.377
And everyone was happy."

00:57.270 --> 00:58.613
Aah!

01:03.878 --> 01:05.824
Time to lay down,
beautiful buddy.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.824
Yeah.

01:06.881 --> 01:09.158
Time to make sleepies.

01:09.217 --> 01:10.821
Ahh.

01:10.886 --> 01:11.796
We killed it, man!

01:11.853 --> 01:13.127
I know!

01:13.188 --> 01:16.533
Okay, all we got to do is
go to the land of the dead

01:16.591 --> 01:19.004
and reclaim the flower's
soul from death before

01:19.061 --> 01:21.132
Bubblegum returns.

01:21.197 --> 01:22.301
Okay.

01:22.365 --> 01:23.435
Excuse me?

01:23.499 --> 01:25.707
But did you all say
"Land of the dead"?

01:25.769 --> 01:26.907
Oh, what?

01:26.970 --> 01:27.880
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:27.938 --> 01:28.882
I can take you.

01:28.939 --> 01:29.883
Really?

01:29.940 --> 01:31.112
Certainly, Finn.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.713
For a small price, which
we can discuss later.

01:33.778 --> 01:35.724
Take my hands, gentlemen.

01:37.115 --> 01:40.392
Stare into where the
two walls meet.

01:40.451 --> 01:43.763
Now slowly cross your eyes.

01:43.823 --> 01:45.496
Do it, fools!

01:47.193 --> 01:50.971
The portal opens.

01:51.031 --> 01:53.637
Say hi to Death for
me if you see him.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.577
He lives in a castle
made of light.

01:55.635 --> 01:56.978
Uh, okay.

01:57.037 --> 01:58.243
Thanks, Peppermint Butler.

01:58.305 --> 02:00.877
And don't drink the... water.

02:00.942 --> 02:02.080
Wow, man.

02:02.143 --> 02:03.663
Who knew Peppermint
Butler was so 00...

02:03.711 --> 02:05.884
Aah!

02:22.632 --> 02:26.206
So, um, you want to
hop in my paunch

02:26.270 --> 02:28.079
and I'll stretch us down?

02:28.138 --> 02:29.276
Uh...

02:29.340 --> 02:30.410
Oh, look. An escalator.

02:32.910 --> 02:33.910
Hey, dude.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.187
That must be the main
entrance or some biz.

02:40.252 --> 02:41.560
Let's go!

02:44.056 --> 02:46.263
Wholly schmao.

02:46.325 --> 02:48.168
Welcome to the underworld.

02:48.227 --> 02:49.228
Cause of death?

02:49.295 --> 02:50.775
Uh, spear in the neck.

02:50.831 --> 02:51.831
You may enter.

02:51.865 --> 02:53.674
Yay!

02:53.734 --> 02:55.179
How did you die?

02:55.235 --> 02:56.908
Uh...

02:56.970 --> 02:59.349
Because we're awesome.

02:59.407 --> 03:00.408
Whoo!

03:01.376 --> 03:02.286
Hmm.

03:02.343 --> 03:03.343
Step out of line.

03:03.378 --> 03:04.448
Aw, dingle.

03:04.512 --> 03:05.388
Wait up, dude.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.255
Follow me and do as I do.

03:10.386 --> 03:12.059
Hey! I said no!

03:13.389 --> 03:14.231
Hey!

03:14.290 --> 03:15.826
He-e-y!

03:15.891 --> 03:17.428
Ha ha! We're in! Come on, man!

03:18.628 --> 03:19.732
Man.

03:20.764 --> 03:21.708
- Yes!
- Yes!

03:21.765 --> 03:22.709
Where do we go now, dude?

03:22.766 --> 03:24.541
UP there!

03:24.601 --> 03:26.240
Ooh!

03:26.304 --> 03:28.306
Death's castle is pretty, dude.

03:28.372 --> 03:29.214
Let's go!

03:29.273 --> 03:30.273
Hup!

03:30.308 --> 03:31.787
Yah!

03:31.842 --> 03:33.185
Hey! Hey, what's up, fellas?

03:33.244 --> 03:34.519
Hi. Lester.

03:34.579 --> 03:36.149
Oh, man... flesh.

03:36.214 --> 03:37.818
I haven't seen this
stuff in forever.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.658
So warm and gushy and salty.

03:39.718 --> 03:41.129
Look at all that flesh jiggling.

03:41.186 --> 03:42.222
Hey.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.701
If you love flesh so
much, then watch this.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.199
Whoa!

03:48.261 --> 03:50.036
You don't know what
you're doing to me, guy.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.337
Fellas, get over here!

03:51.398 --> 03:52.604
Flesh!

03:52.666 --> 03:54.111
Flesh?

03:54.168 --> 03:55.168
Yeah.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.442
- Ooh, for us?
- Whoo-hoo!

03:56.503 --> 03:57.709
Yeah. Flesh.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.342
This is weird, man.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.715
Eh, don't worry.

04:00.775 --> 04:02.083
They just think we're cool.

04:02.143 --> 04:03.463
Hmm. Do you guys
think we're cool?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.785
No.

04:04.846 --> 04:06.655
We're gonna rip that flesh
off you and eat it.

04:09.285 --> 04:11.265
It's bone-kicking time!

04:11.320 --> 04:12.799
Huah! Huah!

04:17.094 --> 04:18.038
Oh, shoot!

04:18.095 --> 04:19.733
Ugh! Get... Ugh, ugh!

04:19.796 --> 04:21.503
Jake, there's too many!

04:23.367 --> 04:24.870
They're trying to peel me!

04:24.936 --> 04:26.415
I'm...

04:26.471 --> 04:27.609
not...

04:27.672 --> 04:28.582
a...

04:28.639 --> 04:29.845
banana!!

04:33.379 --> 04:34.323
Hole!

04:34.380 --> 04:35.620
It's not a hole, Jake.

04:35.681 --> 04:36.751
It's just a divot.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.192
Ugh!

04:38.250 --> 04:39.558
Sorry!

04:39.618 --> 04:41.929
They're getting away. Yeah!

04:41.988 --> 04:43.160
Get 'em! Get 'em!

04:43.223 --> 04:44.099
Get some bad blood.

04:44.157 --> 04:45.363
Dude, shrink down.

04:45.425 --> 04:46.699
Oh, sorry.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.433
I don't like the
underworld too much.

04:48.495 --> 04:49.803
I don't know.

04:49.863 --> 04:51.408
It wouldn't be so bad
if there weren't folks

04:51.432 --> 04:52.672
trying to eat our skin.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.974
I wonder how Princess
Bubblegum is doing.

04:55.036 --> 04:57.414
So, who here
invented this thing?

05:00.042 --> 05:02.318
I'm glad she's not coming
back till tomorrow.

05:02.377 --> 05:05.187
No, she said she's coming
back "On the Morrow."

05:05.247 --> 05:06.521
Yeah, on the morrow.

05:06.581 --> 05:07.754
That means tomorrow.

05:07.817 --> 05:08.693
No, man.

05:08.751 --> 05:09.957
The Morrow is her bird.

05:10.019 --> 05:10.861
Come again.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.126
It's her bird.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.724
That thing is crazy fast.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.997
It'll only take her, like,
20 minutes to get back once

05:16.060 --> 05:17.562
that conference is over.

05:17.628 --> 05:19.130
Are you listening, man?

05:19.196 --> 05:21.904
The Morrow...

05:21.965 --> 05:26.711
is... a... bird.

05:27.672 --> 05:29.652
Then we got to go!

05:29.707 --> 05:30.811
Coast is clear!

05:30.875 --> 05:32.320
Halt!

05:32.377 --> 05:33.982
Hey. Hey, Halt.

05:34.046 --> 05:35.616
Why you got your
eyes closed, Halt?

05:35.681 --> 05:39.458
I'm trying to picture in my
mind's eye where the fleshies

05:39.518 --> 05:40.724
are hiding.

05:40.786 --> 05:41.788
Ohh.

05:41.855 --> 05:43.892
You're a smart guy, Halt.

05:47.561 --> 05:49.700
Wait. Jake, do you
hear something?

05:49.763 --> 05:50.708
I don't know where they are.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.210
Come on.

05:52.266 --> 05:53.777
Then I didn't see them.
I was looking here.

05:53.801 --> 05:54.801
And now they're gone.

05:56.037 --> 05:57.175
More skeletons.

05:57.238 --> 06:00.846
We've got to be
really, really quiet.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.758
Get 'em!

06:06.815 --> 06:07.726
Jake.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.263
I thought it would be funny!

06:09.319 --> 06:10.389
Ugh!

06:10.453 --> 06:11.830
Ya-a-h!

06:15.325 --> 06:17.363
Look! There's death's castle!

06:19.163 --> 06:20.574
I don't see anyone.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.409
I guess you double-killed
them with that Avalanche.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.174
Awesome.

06:24.235 --> 06:26.147
Now we just got to
cross that river.

06:26.204 --> 06:27.239
River!

06:27.305 --> 06:29.080
Man, I'm so thirsty.

06:29.141 --> 06:31.052
My mouth's still all dusty!

06:31.109 --> 06:32.281
Yes.

06:32.344 --> 06:33.221
Aah!

06:33.279 --> 06:35.020
Drink the water.

06:35.081 --> 06:36.389
Whoa. Okay, Jake.

06:36.449 --> 06:37.553
Don't drink the water.

06:37.617 --> 06:38.617
Come on!

06:38.651 --> 06:39.994
I'm so thirsty!

06:40.052 --> 06:42.465
Dude, that skull wants
you to drink the water.

06:42.523 --> 06:43.797
It's bad water.

06:43.857 --> 06:45.928
Don't drink the water.

06:45.993 --> 06:46.937
See?

06:46.994 --> 06:48.098
That means good, right?

06:48.162 --> 06:49.539
Yep!

06:49.596 --> 06:51.599
Jake?

06:51.666 --> 06:54.078
Jake, why are you
making stupid face?

06:54.135 --> 06:55.079
Who's Jake?

06:55.136 --> 06:57.138
Dang it! I knew that
water was junk!

06:57.205 --> 06:59.686
Tricked again by the
river of forgetfulness!

06:59.742 --> 07:01.016
Jake!

07:01.076 --> 07:02.487
Get out of that water right now!

07:02.545 --> 07:04.684
Hey, I don't know who
you are, Mister,

07:04.747 --> 07:07.125
but I don't like your attitude.

07:08.151 --> 07:09.858
Help! Somebody!

07:11.054 --> 07:12.727
Farewell, everyone.

07:14.758 --> 07:16.534
Tsk. Okay.

07:16.594 --> 07:19.370
Morrow, back to the
Candy Kingdom.

07:22.266 --> 07:23.266
Help!

07:23.301 --> 07:25.009
Somebody help me!

07:25.070 --> 07:26.879
Stranger danger!

07:30.475 --> 07:32.751
Hey. Hey. I see you.

07:32.811 --> 07:33.984
Jake, your head.

07:34.047 --> 07:35.720
Huh? Who are you?

07:35.782 --> 07:36.886
Who are you?

07:36.950 --> 07:37.951
I don't know, man.

07:38.017 --> 07:38.893
Who are you?

07:38.952 --> 07:39.794
What do you mean?

07:39.852 --> 07:41.058
You're in my castle!

07:41.120 --> 07:42.225
Well, I didn't know.

07:42.289 --> 07:43.290
Dang it, Jake.

07:43.357 --> 07:45.359
You must leave this place...
now.

07:45.426 --> 07:46.905
Death!

07:46.961 --> 07:49.202
We're not leaving until you
give us our plant's soul...

07:49.263 --> 07:50.709
and Jake's memory!

07:50.765 --> 07:51.766
Another one.

07:51.833 --> 07:52.937
Be gone, mortal!

07:53.001 --> 07:55.140
No! I promised
Princess Bubblegum.

07:55.203 --> 07:56.375
Ya-a-h!

07:56.438 --> 07:57.473
Huh? Ugh!

07:57.539 --> 07:59.679
Ohh. What happened?

07:59.742 --> 08:02.245
You can't kick me because
your brain is stupid!

08:02.311 --> 08:03.483
Hah!

08:03.546 --> 08:05.048
Your brain is stupid!

08:06.616 --> 08:07.789
This kid's pretty funny.

08:07.851 --> 08:10.354
All right.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.364
Pick an instrument.

08:11.421 --> 08:12.798
Huh?

08:12.856 --> 08:17.272
To get stuff from me, you have
to beat me in a musical battle.

08:17.328 --> 08:20.275
But Jake's the musical one,
and he's got poo brain!

08:21.733 --> 08:22.734
I don't care.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.542
I got to find one I
can really play.

08:27.606 --> 08:28.676
Oh, Glob, man.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.619
Oh, here we go.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.782
Sleigh bells!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.847
Yeah-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow!

08:34.914 --> 08:36.825
So the contest begins.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.686
Yeah!

08:43.491 --> 08:44.834
Yeah! Yeah!

08:49.096 --> 08:50.633
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!

08:52.234 --> 08:53.542
Ye-e-ah!

08:58.708 --> 09:00.085
Uhh, um...

09:01.444 --> 09:03.890
Hey, all right, so...
who do you think won?

09:03.946 --> 09:05.220
Oh, man!

09:05.281 --> 09:07.159
Skeleton guy by a landslide!

09:07.217 --> 09:08.217
He was like...

09:09.353 --> 09:10.195
Dude!

09:10.254 --> 09:11.130
What?

09:11.188 --> 09:12.189
Skeleton guy was awesome.

09:12.256 --> 09:13.200
You want me to lie?

09:13.257 --> 09:14.167
Yes.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.034
I'm going to kill you now.

09:16.094 --> 09:17.094
No!

09:17.128 --> 09:18.471
I still have to rescue stuff!

09:18.530 --> 09:20.737
Those are the rules in
the land of the dead.

09:20.799 --> 09:24.247
Lose a music battle,
lose your life.

09:24.303 --> 09:25.782
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

09:25.838 --> 09:28.876
Before I die, I'm honor-bound
to tell you Peppermint Butler

09:28.941 --> 09:29.817
says hi.

09:29.875 --> 09:30.785
What?!

09:30.843 --> 09:32.015
You know Peppermint Butler?

09:32.078 --> 09:33.078
Yeah.

09:34.147 --> 09:36.127
Yo, you guys can have
whatever you want.

09:36.183 --> 09:37.628
Jake, stand up.

09:37.684 --> 09:38.856
That's me, right?

09:38.919 --> 09:41.332
Yes.

09:41.389 --> 09:42.629
What are you doing?

09:45.426 --> 09:46.632
What are you doing?!

09:46.694 --> 09:48.332
Kiss of death, baby.

09:48.396 --> 09:49.933
You got your memory back.

09:49.999 --> 09:51.410
AW, gross!

09:51.467 --> 09:52.605
I Wish I didn't.

09:52.668 --> 09:56.081
Now I shall return
the soul of this.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.175
Yeah, the Princess Plant!

09:59.909 --> 10:01.479
I'll see you dudes later.

10:06.316 --> 10:07.421
Hello, boys.

10:07.485 --> 10:08.691
Where's my plant?

10:08.753 --> 10:09.823
Hello, Princess.

10:09.887 --> 10:10.957
Yay!

10:12.823 --> 10:15.201
Mm, mmm-mmm.

10:18.697 --> 10:21.906
Thank you, all, for taking
such good care of my plant.

10:21.967 --> 10:24.346
Now, come here and
give me a hug.

10:24.404 --> 10:25.906
Yay! Hugs!

10:25.972 --> 10:27.781
You guys are the best.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.444
Ahem.

10:29.509 --> 10:31.682
Mr. Finn? Mr. Jake?

10:31.744 --> 10:34.954
I believe you still owe me
something in exchange for that

10:35.015 --> 10:36.551
favor I did.

10:36.617 --> 10:38.255
- Sure.
- Yeah. What is it?

10:38.318 --> 10:39.797
I'd like your flesh.

10:41.022 --> 10:43.161
Quit being silly,
Peppermint Butler.

10:43.224 --> 10:46.637
I'm going to take it from
you while you sleep!
