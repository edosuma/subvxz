WEBVTT

00:07.521 --> 00:11.721
I'll send him and his whole family to
a concentration camp. On the next train.

00:11.921 --> 00:14.161
Or he can go home. It's up to him.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.881
The Germans... Forster...
we have to take everything.

00:18.001 --> 00:19.441
They can't find any evidence.

00:23.681 --> 00:26.201
We've got to get the e-compressor started.

00:26.361 --> 00:29.241
And then pray to God that we'll compress
enough air to blow the tanks.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.721
One of us has to go in there.

00:30.801 --> 00:31.801
He'll die.

00:31.921 --> 00:34.361
One of us has to do it,
or else we can't surface.

01:32.281 --> 01:33.881
What's wrong?

01:34.641 --> 01:37.241
You've got to go.
My landlady will come home soon.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.281
- She has been working night shift.
- So what?

01:39.401 --> 01:41.121
She can't find you here.

01:49.321 --> 01:50.841
Unfortunately,
it's just coffee substitute.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.321
Thanks.

01:52.761 --> 01:54.561
I'll get you real coffee.

01:58.081 --> 01:59.681
My landlady,

02:00.401 --> 02:01.961
she's on the list, too.

02:05.241 --> 02:06.121
I see.

02:06.601 --> 02:08.001
And as we...

02:08.641 --> 02:11.001
as we're friends now, her and I,

02:11.241 --> 02:12.361
I thought...

02:12.721 --> 02:14.121
You know the situation, Simone.

02:14.521 --> 02:16.201
Field Command Headquarters signed off
on the names

02:16.321 --> 02:18.401
and I can't do anything about it.
Even if I wanted to.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.041
Don't worry.

02:24.321 --> 02:26.961
Once we've caught Monroe,
everyone on that list will be safe.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.001
It won't be long now.

02:32.641 --> 02:33.641
Simone,

02:36.001 --> 02:37.801
I love you.

02:39.041 --> 02:41.001
Hagen, I...

02:41.161 --> 02:43.121
The house, this house that

02:43.281 --> 02:46.601
I bought is way too big for me on my own.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.801
All right, I,

02:51.161 --> 02:52.601
I don't want to push you.

02:53.201 --> 02:55.841
I wouldn't want to be with a
woman who's easy to get.

02:59.681 --> 03:00.841
I've got to go.

03:01.241 --> 03:04.001
- Yes. See you later.
- See you later.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.921
What happened to him?

05:43.721 --> 05:44.961
Flash fire.

05:45.881 --> 05:47.841
Tried to weld a leaky U-boat diesel tank.

05:48.961 --> 05:51.961
What is it, Mr. Duval?
I've got work to do.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.281
We found that last night.
In a Résistance hideout.

06:02.281 --> 06:04.081
It's old stuff. It's expired.

06:06.001 --> 06:07.401
Don't get me wrong.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.921
I'd like to avoid further violence.

06:11.521 --> 06:13.001
I assume you know about the list?

06:14.441 --> 06:15.921
100 hostages.

06:16.881 --> 06:18.041
The consequences would be terrible.

06:19.321 --> 06:21.161
The guardian angel of La Rochelle.

06:25.001 --> 06:26.681
Do you smell this, Mr. Duval?

06:28.001 --> 06:29.561
That's the smell of death.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.561
People die in here. Every day.
And you know why?

06:33.281 --> 06:35.401
Because the Germans are at war
with the whole world.

06:35.641 --> 06:37.841
We treat them nevertheless,
even if we're short of everything here,

06:37.961 --> 06:39.161
especially morphine.

06:39.841 --> 06:42.441
That's why I assure you
that this is not from here.

06:42.961 --> 06:44.441
That's what you wanted to ask, right?

06:45.881 --> 06:47.761
I'm just fulfilling my duty.

06:48.161 --> 06:49.201
Yes.

06:49.561 --> 06:52.121
We all do. Unfortunately.

06:53.241 --> 06:56.081
Keep it and give it to him. He needs it.

07:09.401 --> 07:12.641
Criminal Inspector? We managed to
identify the other two dead bodies.

07:12.761 --> 07:15.881
One of them is French. Claude Martin.
Worked at the naval base docks.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.121
We found this inside the house.

07:23.521 --> 07:25.321
Last night, they came
from western direction?

07:25.601 --> 07:26.641
Yes.

07:27.801 --> 07:28.881
Where does that road go?

07:30.081 --> 07:31.201
Along the coast.

07:53.121 --> 07:55.521
The depth charges damaged
the saddle tanks.

07:55.801 --> 07:57.281
How long will the fuel last?

07:58.281 --> 08:00.121
For one day. Tops.

08:00.561 --> 08:03.081
We can't use all of it to avoid
piston seizure by running on empty.

08:03.161 --> 08:04.281
What about the batteries?

08:04.361 --> 08:05.561
They're fully charged.

08:05.641 --> 08:06.841
We should talk.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.761
We're somewhere around here.

08:20.281 --> 08:21.681
But we don't know the exact location.

08:22.921 --> 08:25.801
No positioning is possible; the sun
is not coming through.

08:26.561 --> 08:27.961
What about the receivers and transmitters?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.161
Pile of scrap.

08:29.241 --> 08:32.081
And I'm not able to repair it without
the right spare parts.

08:32.201 --> 08:34.961
We have the VHF device but
it's useless out here.

08:35.561 --> 08:36.641
And if we dive?

08:36.761 --> 08:38.121
I could try to locate with hydrophones.

08:38.241 --> 08:39.681
Maybe we'll find another ship.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.921
And pray that it's one of ours.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.521
We could only bump
into convoys around here.

08:45.881 --> 08:47.201
And then what?

08:47.721 --> 08:48.681
Want to surrender?

08:49.361 --> 08:51.001
I don't want to surrender.

08:51.241 --> 08:52.761
Or continue fighting.

08:54.521 --> 08:56.121
The only thing I want is to get home.

08:56.201 --> 08:57.561
Oh yeah, that's very important.

08:58.281 --> 09:00.121
They'll detain us immediately

09:00.241 --> 09:03.161
and then put all of us in front
of court-martial. All of us.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.521
Are you going to tell them?

09:04.641 --> 09:05.641
What?

09:05.761 --> 09:07.001
What happened here?

09:08.201 --> 09:09.441
Nobody knows, apart from us.

09:11.081 --> 09:12.881
The guys in La Rochelle have no clue.

09:13.201 --> 09:14.201
The logbook...

09:14.681 --> 09:17.001
nothing has been written in it
since Greenwood's exchange.

09:19.521 --> 09:20.601
Yes.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.521
So we can still write in it what
happened.

09:34.761 --> 09:36.361
But we have to get home first.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.281
And how do we do that?

09:38.441 --> 09:39.641
Without fuel?

09:39.881 --> 09:40.961
No idea.

09:41.321 --> 09:43.801
We would have to find a German ship first.

09:46.721 --> 09:47.961
Submerged running.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.281
Until we're far enough away
from the convoy routes.

09:51.761 --> 09:53.881
How far will we get with running on
the batteries at 3 knots?

09:56.681 --> 09:57.761
180 miles.

10:01.641 --> 10:03.081
A course in south-eastern direction.

10:03.721 --> 10:05.921
That would get us at least a bit closer
to the French coast.

10:17.601 --> 10:19.801
Set new course one-three-five.

10:21.161 --> 10:22.241
Rig ship for dive.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.281
Simone.

10:55.201 --> 10:56.361
Is she upstairs?

10:57.441 --> 10:58.641
No, but...

10:59.081 --> 11:00.281
I know where she is.

11:01.641 --> 11:03.121
Could you hide her?

11:03.521 --> 11:04.841
Outside of town?

11:05.641 --> 11:06.961
At my farm.

11:07.281 --> 11:08.401
But not forever.

11:09.881 --> 11:11.001
She has to leave La Rochelle.

11:11.161 --> 11:12.641
How? There are soldiers everywhere.

11:19.001 --> 11:20.161
I'm scared.

11:21.561 --> 11:22.681
Me too.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.201
You came here by car?

11:29.041 --> 11:30.081
Come with me.

14:41.121 --> 14:42.881
We've got to stick together now.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.161
Chief!

14:49.401 --> 14:51.761
It won't work if the officers
won't keep their mouths shut.

14:52.201 --> 14:53.881
Then we could stay out here.

14:56.201 --> 14:59.001
Maybe we should just face what we
did to Hoffmann.

14:59.641 --> 15:01.801
- And Max.
- Would it bring them back to life?

15:01.881 --> 15:02.881
No.

15:03.241 --> 15:06.081
But at least some backstabbing
bastards would hang for it.

15:09.521 --> 15:11.241
But you don't have to worry.

15:12.121 --> 15:13.961
I'll keep my cowardly trap shut.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.441
If Wrangel doesn't play along you can
forget about it anyway.

15:26.961 --> 15:28.001
Frank.

15:28.601 --> 15:29.601
Frank.

15:33.441 --> 15:34.441
Listen.

15:39.161 --> 15:40.401
Knocking noises.

15:51.441 --> 15:52.561
SOS.

15:57.281 --> 15:58.321
Bearing?

16:00.201 --> 16:01.321
45 degrees.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.121
Moving to the right.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.761
You can clearly hear the signal?

16:07.521 --> 16:08.681
Yes.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.761
It's slowly getting louder.

16:17.801 --> 16:19.361
Battle stations!

16:26.561 --> 16:29.441
Battle stations!
Come on, you lazy bastards.

16:29.561 --> 16:30.881
Move it, assholes.

16:37.001 --> 16:38.121
Hey!

16:38.441 --> 16:39.601
Killer!

16:42.441 --> 16:43.961
What's wrong with you?

16:46.561 --> 16:48.281
It won't work out as long as I'm on board.

16:48.401 --> 16:49.401
What?

16:50.121 --> 16:51.281
I'm just bad luck.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.041
Because you're a whore cheater?

16:53.321 --> 16:54.361
A whore cheater?

16:54.521 --> 16:55.721
Someone who pays but doesn't fuck.

16:56.001 --> 16:57.921
That has nothing to do with our bad luck.

16:58.121 --> 17:00.761
And now do your job or else
you'll get fucked.

17:00.921 --> 17:02.001
By me.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.281
Nothing.

17:37.321 --> 17:38.841
The signal grows louder.

17:42.241 --> 17:44.041
It could take forever until we find it.

17:45.601 --> 17:47.241
Like a needle in a haystack.

17:54.921 --> 17:58.521
Kilometer 223,5, near Royan.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.201
That's the direction the car came from.

18:02.161 --> 18:05.601
Half an hour of peace and quiet.
Without patrol boats.

18:05.681 --> 18:07.441
A delivery across the sea?

18:07.681 --> 18:09.721
Yes. Explosives and weapons.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.721
Who has this information, apart from you?

18:14.001 --> 18:16.761
The routes of the coastguard are changed
every week.

18:16.881 --> 18:20.241
That's the task of the French.
French coastguard.

18:20.321 --> 18:22.241
I always get a copy.

18:22.361 --> 18:24.841
I hope we'll find the traitor
amongst them.

18:30.881 --> 18:32.601
More losses?

18:33.001 --> 18:34.321
Yes.

18:34.841 --> 18:37.001
Three boats sunk, one's missing.

18:37.561 --> 18:38.401
Hoffmann.

18:39.561 --> 18:42.321
Lorient received the last message
four days ago.

18:42.561 --> 18:44.161
Silence ever since.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.561
Miss Strasser deserves to know.

18:52.761 --> 18:54.001
Losses are not within my duties.

18:54.241 --> 18:55.761
Oh, Forster.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.361
I'm not stupid.

18:58.361 --> 19:04.561
I know that your reasons for choosing
that boat weren't entirely professional.

19:06.001 --> 19:08.041
You should be the one to tell her.

19:19.881 --> 19:21.161
Simone?

19:25.001 --> 19:26.321
We have to talk.

19:26.961 --> 19:29.681
Yes? About what?

19:39.761 --> 19:40.761
Not here.

19:40.841 --> 19:42.441
Tonight, at my place.

19:43.521 --> 19:44.441
All right.

19:45.961 --> 19:47.201
My driver will pick you up.

19:48.801 --> 19:50.201
See you tonight then.

20:49.401 --> 20:50.721
How are you feeling?

20:51.121 --> 20:52.121
I'm okay.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.001
I gave you something.

21:07.321 --> 21:08.641
Probably a bit too much.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.801
You've slept like a baby.

21:14.001 --> 21:15.041
Carla.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.641
- It's over.
- No.

21:24.881 --> 21:25.881
Émile!

21:25.961 --> 21:26.961
On my way.

21:32.961 --> 21:34.641
The whole of France?

21:34.881 --> 21:36.281
Claude and Luc are dead.

21:36.961 --> 21:38.521
We've got about 40 bullets left.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.441
So, what are we supposed
to accomplish with that?

22:03.681 --> 22:04.801
I need to take a leak.

22:04.921 --> 22:06.041
Help me, please.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.001
Who is this woman, Émile?

22:10.841 --> 22:12.081
She's just a friend.

22:12.241 --> 22:13.561
The woman speaks English.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.601
I don't want people in my house
who speak English.

22:16.761 --> 22:17.761
You hear me?

22:17.881 --> 22:18.961
I know, Dad.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.041
A vessel.

22:36.321 --> 22:37.521
An old ship.

22:39.801 --> 22:40.801
No speed.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.561
Not very seaworthy.

23:02.361 --> 23:04.921
Make ready tubes number one and two
for surface firing.

23:07.561 --> 23:09.441
Make ready tubes number one and two
for surface firing.

23:09.561 --> 23:10.761
Rig ship for surface.

23:31.921 --> 23:34.001
Cyrillic characters.

23:41.601 --> 23:44.521
It's a coastal ship.
Apparently no living soul on board.

23:44.601 --> 23:45.841
So far out?

23:46.401 --> 23:48.161
Maybe they're all dead.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.401
We need fuel.

23:55.241 --> 23:56.401
We have to board.

24:01.401 --> 24:03.281
Do any of you have experience
in close combat?

24:05.361 --> 24:08.361
Have any of you ever killed a man?
With your own bare hands?

24:13.841 --> 24:14.841
Yes.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.561
I did.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.001
Does anyone speak Russian?

24:33.521 --> 24:34.681
Apart from me?

24:49.521 --> 24:50.561
I'll go with you.

24:50.841 --> 24:51.841
What?

24:52.641 --> 24:53.841
You need me there.

24:54.281 --> 24:55.561
A mad man?

24:59.281 --> 25:00.641
Who else is going to lead the men?

25:01.801 --> 25:02.721
You?

25:06.361 --> 25:08.441
This boat needs a Captain.

25:10.121 --> 25:11.921
Otherwise, the fuel won't help you.

25:13.281 --> 25:14.801
And Ehrenberg,

25:15.001 --> 25:18.241
he'll crack during the first interrogation
of the submarine command.

25:22.801 --> 25:23.961
We have no choice.

25:25.601 --> 25:27.001
Have you lost it?

25:29.041 --> 25:31.841
No. He's right.

25:32.001 --> 25:33.961
Otherwise we're all going to be
court-martialed.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.521
The entire crew.

25:41.921 --> 25:42.921
I promise you one thing,

25:43.001 --> 25:45.761
if you try to fuck with us, it won't be a
Russian bullet in the head for you

25:45.841 --> 25:47.201
but a German one in the back.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.001
We can go downstairs here.

28:49.641 --> 28:51.721
You stay here and watch our backs.

28:51.961 --> 28:53.041
You too.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.161
Don't shoot.

29:47.241 --> 29:48.241
Please.

29:48.441 --> 29:49.401
Don't shoot.

29:50.001 --> 29:51.921
- You're German?
- Yes.

29:52.681 --> 29:55.001
- Banat Swabian.
- On a Russian ship?

29:56.001 --> 29:57.241
We're in trouble.

30:10.841 --> 30:11.961
Walk!

30:50.081 --> 30:52.441
Gentlemen, welcome aboard the Kasak.

30:54.081 --> 30:55.921
I am Captain Martin Chafroff.

30:58.441 --> 30:59.921
You're all German?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.001
2 Germans, 4 Romanians.

31:03.521 --> 31:06.001
And a souvenir from the Ukraine.

31:07.441 --> 31:09.121
That's the whole crew?

31:10.601 --> 31:12.001
It's a small ship.

31:12.841 --> 31:14.441
Why are you hiding down here?

31:15.081 --> 31:18.121
We're not hiding. We're lying dead
on the water.

31:18.401 --> 31:20.441
Our machinist went mad.

31:20.961 --> 31:23.841
Drank too much schnapps.
Shot at the engine.

31:24.001 --> 31:25.561
We tried to repair it, but...

31:26.881 --> 31:28.601
The starter machine is probably broken.

31:28.681 --> 31:29.881
Where is he now?

31:30.121 --> 31:31.161
Dead.

31:33.201 --> 31:34.881
Can you repair the engine?

31:36.001 --> 31:37.761
How much fuel do you have?

31:38.681 --> 31:39.801
Enough.

31:40.521 --> 31:42.441
Did you run out of fuel?

31:43.601 --> 31:45.281
That pretty much sums it up.

32:05.201 --> 32:06.561
My machinist

32:07.641 --> 32:09.361
will get your engine running

32:11.041 --> 32:13.561
and you'll give me the fuel
I need in return.

32:40.561 --> 32:42.001
Take a look at it.

32:43.601 --> 32:45.321
And you go with him.

32:59.761 --> 33:01.081
Schnapps?

33:09.881 --> 33:11.921
We're lucky that you found us.

33:18.921 --> 33:20.081
Get out of the way.

33:27.401 --> 33:29.681
Shit, what the fuck?

33:44.961 --> 33:47.401
So? Can you repair the engine?

33:48.281 --> 33:49.641
I can try.

34:27.841 --> 34:29.361
Did you hear that?

34:33.961 --> 34:35.521
No, I don't hear anything.

34:37.001 --> 34:38.001
Listen.

34:49.561 --> 34:52.361
I've probably been standing next to
the engines for too long.

35:01.001 --> 35:02.201
Thorsten.

35:03.961 --> 35:05.161
Thorsten.

35:06.761 --> 35:08.721
Thorsten, what are you doing?

35:09.961 --> 35:11.281
I'll have a look.

35:12.001 --> 35:13.961
Wrangel told us to stay here.

35:35.881 --> 35:37.001
Thorsten.

36:27.801 --> 36:29.001
I won't hurt you.

37:13.121 --> 37:14.601
Everything is all right.

37:17.721 --> 37:20.001
I won't hurt you. I promise.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.761
Halifax, that was our destination.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.121
Canada?

37:40.241 --> 37:42.241
Yes, east coast.

37:43.601 --> 37:46.001
There are German speaking communities.

37:47.521 --> 37:50.121
As Germans you could all fight
for Germany.

37:51.761 --> 37:53.281
We are refugees.

37:56.001 --> 37:57.441
Deserters.

38:01.001 --> 38:02.601
Survivors.

38:11.241 --> 38:13.201
It's all my fault.

38:15.081 --> 38:16.961
It's all my fault, you know?

38:18.921 --> 38:21.041
All of the bad luck on board.

38:21.121 --> 38:23.561
It's all my fault.

39:11.441 --> 39:13.161
I've had enough of the war.

39:14.681 --> 39:16.921
Should I tell you some stories
about the war in the east, my friend?

39:17.801 --> 39:20.201
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.601
Charkow.

39:22.681 --> 39:24.081
57th Army?

39:25.721 --> 39:27.441
Gorodnjanski.

39:30.321 --> 39:32.001
Good man.

39:33.201 --> 39:35.241
Made our life hell.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.201
Podlas

39:49.001 --> 39:50.961
was the Commander of the 57th.

39:52.121 --> 39:53.881
Not Gorodnjanski.

39:55.361 --> 39:57.001
You've never been to war.

40:40.121 --> 40:41.561
Check on the others.

41:35.361 --> 41:38.081
Take him on deck.
And then prepare for refueling.

41:39.281 --> 41:40.841
You, with me. And you too.

43:39.401 --> 43:41.441
Our daughter is there.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.121
Have you seen a girl?

43:45.841 --> 43:47.281
Jews.

43:50.921 --> 43:54.241
A girl, a beautiful girl,
with blonde hair?

44:00.001 --> 44:01.161
No?

44:03.641 --> 44:04.721
Please.

44:05.761 --> 44:06.841
Shoot us.

44:11.361 --> 44:12.801
Just two bullets.

44:23.281 --> 44:24.281
We

44:24.721 --> 44:26.801
gave all our money.

44:28.561 --> 44:30.281
To take us to Canada.

44:35.001 --> 44:36.041
Please.

44:45.241 --> 44:46.561
Thank you.

44:46.841 --> 44:48.081
Thank you.

45:34.681 --> 45:36.401
Give the signal.

45:45.121 --> 45:47.121
Both engines slow ahead.

46:02.161 --> 46:03.561
Maybe it was me.

46:07.761 --> 46:09.681
Maybe I was bad luck.

46:56.841 --> 46:58.041
Come with me.

47:26.881 --> 47:28.081
Tube number two.

47:28.961 --> 47:30.001
Fire!

47:47.041 --> 47:49.081
Your plan for getting the men home safely.

47:51.601 --> 47:52.961
You can trust me.

48:22.881 --> 48:25.441
Yes. Let go. Let go!

49:22.241 --> 49:23.361
I can't take care of her anymore.

49:24.521 --> 49:25.761
It has been long enough.

49:26.601 --> 49:27.761
Take her with you.

49:27.961 --> 49:30.001
Or I'll leave her
in front of the hospital.

49:31.041 --> 49:32.961
A baby and an old woman.

49:34.321 --> 49:36.521
Visited first by one daughter
and then suddenly by a second one,

49:36.601 --> 49:37.801
who look nothing alike?

49:37.881 --> 49:39.361
The neighbors already talk.

49:40.001 --> 49:41.801
Why should I take risks and you don't?

49:42.281 --> 49:43.441
Give me more time.

49:44.361 --> 49:45.961
I will find a solution, please.

49:46.401 --> 49:47.681
Two days.

49:48.441 --> 49:50.001
For the child's sake.

49:50.081 --> 49:51.441
Not one day more.

49:51.721 --> 49:52.681
All right.

51:18.561 --> 51:19.841
May I?

51:23.401 --> 51:24.761
Please, take a seat.

51:47.121 --> 51:48.521
Simone.

51:49.841 --> 51:52.721
There are things that only a friend
should tell you, a...

51:52.841 --> 51:54.561
person who loves you.

51:56.081 --> 51:59.001
Maybe that softens the hard things.

52:04.681 --> 52:06.161
U-612 is missing.

52:09.521 --> 52:12.401
Hoffmann's boat. Frank's boat.

52:16.441 --> 52:19.761
They had to engage in battle.
Four days ago. Ever since

52:20.881 --> 52:22.121
there has been no contact.

52:34.201 --> 52:35.521
I'm so very sorry.

52:38.881 --> 52:40.121
Will you excuse me please.

52:56.921 --> 52:58.401
They've kidnapped Gluck.

52:59.001 --> 53:00.521
I've got to go. I have no choice.

53:00.681 --> 53:02.761
My driver will take you home
whenever you want.

53:09.721 --> 53:12.361
I can't replace your brother,
but I'll always be there for you.

53:29.201 --> 53:30.201
Margot.

53:30.641 --> 53:31.601
You have to go.

53:31.721 --> 53:32.761
What?

53:33.881 --> 53:35.281
What do you mean by "You have to go"?

53:36.601 --> 53:38.081
They will round up people.

53:38.521 --> 53:39.561
The hostages.

53:39.881 --> 53:40.881
You're on the list.

53:40.961 --> 53:42.001
What?

53:42.241 --> 53:44.921
Listen carefully.
This is a false passport.

53:45.081 --> 53:46.001
Take it.

53:46.241 --> 53:48.641
If you change your hair
you'll look like her, you'll see.

53:48.841 --> 53:50.361
It'll work, all right?

53:51.881 --> 53:53.761
And you'll take the baby. Anna.

53:54.521 --> 53:55.401
You'll take her with you.

53:55.521 --> 53:56.401
Why?

53:58.041 --> 53:59.041
Frank is dead.

54:04.761 --> 54:05.681
What about you?

54:05.761 --> 54:07.001
I can't leave.

54:07.681 --> 54:08.721
I can't go.

54:09.201 --> 54:10.361
But you can.

54:11.601 --> 54:12.561
You can!

54:49.881 --> 54:52.401
I want every single stone to be
turned over in that town,

54:52.521 --> 54:54.601
every door to be opened,
every cellar to be searched.

54:55.801 --> 54:57.721
You all know the standard procedure
in such a case.

54:57.801 --> 54:59.921
The Field Commander received the
corresponding orders from Paris

55:00.001 --> 55:01.121
half an hour ago.

55:01.201 --> 55:04.041
So, let's round up the hostages.

55:04.801 --> 55:05.841
Dismissed!
