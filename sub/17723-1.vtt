WEBVTT

00:17.217 --> 00:22.287
MAN:
Who dares to challenge
the Mage of Aknar?

00:22.289 --> 00:24.390
Okay, that was great.
Uh, let's try it again,

00:24.392 --> 00:27.292
maybe with a little more
wizard-like quality.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.728
Well, what kind of wizard is he?

00:29.730 --> 00:32.564
A... magic wizard?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.800
Ah. Okay.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.335
I got it.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.237
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.140
Guess who was begging me
to come to work again today.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.208
Oh, well, who would know more
about video games

00:43.210 --> 00:45.644
than your 65-year-old dad?
Yeah.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.312
He was actually waiting

00:47.314 --> 00:49.548
in the backseat of the car
with his briefcase.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.153
Oh, he thinks
he's business people.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.821
You know,

00:55.823 --> 00:58.223
we could always give your dad
a pretend office here.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.593
Cute little nameplate,
phone plugged into nothing.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.228
Are you kidding me?
I don't want him here.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.164
It's bad enough
he has to live with me.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.365
Well, you could've said no.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.499
I can't say no to him.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.835
What kind of person
does that to their own father?

01:09.837 --> 01:12.171
Me. I would have enjoyed it.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.541
In fact, I'm gonna randomly text
my dad the word "no" right now.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.210
No, don't do that.
All caps, and send.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.245
(chuckles)

01:21.281 --> 01:24.450
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:24.452 --> 01:26.518
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:26.520 --> 01:30.522
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:30.524 --> 01:32.558
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:32.560 --> 01:36.795
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:36.797 --> 01:41.400
¶ So many questions have I

01:41.402 --> 01:43.302
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:43.304 --> 01:46.105
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.120
I saw you.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.224
(laughing):
I saw you, too!

02:05.226 --> 02:07.126
Do you see this?

02:07.128 --> 02:09.962
Your father made a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.766
I already have two kids;
I don't need a third.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.268
Honey, you have got to start

02:16.270 --> 02:17.503
talking to him
about this stuff.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.938
No, I don't.
See, my relationship with my dad

02:19.940 --> 02:22.107
is based on a mutual
avoidance of conflict.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.910
You know, you could learn
a lot from us, okay?

02:24.912 --> 02:26.311
Okay.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.380
Warner?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.417
Warner?

02:32.419 --> 02:36.121
Ah. Warner, the last four
of your social is

02:36.123 --> 02:38.323
7-1-4-6, correct?

02:40.793 --> 02:44.530
(nervous chuckle): Uh, y-yeah,
but why are you using it?
Well,

02:44.532 --> 02:47.366
if I use mine, the IRS
would be all over this place

02:47.368 --> 02:48.934
like flies on a ham.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.202
(chuckles)

02:50.204 --> 02:51.870
I'll explain it all
to you later

02:51.872 --> 02:54.339
when I'm off the phone
with Burt Dillard.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.609
Who's Burt Dillard?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.311
I-I don't know.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.380
All my dad's associates
have "businessman" names,

03:01.382 --> 03:03.482
like Burt Dillard...

03:03.484 --> 03:05.684
Thatcher Wainwright...

03:06.953 --> 03:09.188
Jock Upson.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.392
Well, Burt Dillard, done deal.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.560
Camila, would you mind

03:14.562 --> 03:16.628
pretending to be my secretary?

03:16.630 --> 03:20.532
I need to give a ring
to Granger Watts.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.969
<i>Gracias, muchacha. </i>
<i>You're a peach.</i>

03:23.971 --> 03:25.370
(chuckles)
Woop!

03:25.372 --> 03:26.538
(gasps)

03:29.742 --> 03:31.710
Well, now that you've...
seen it,

03:31.712 --> 03:34.413
I won't be needing a towel
from here on out.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.360
(phone rings)

03:48.362 --> 03:49.695
(whispers):
Hi, Dad.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.930
Hello?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.999
Eli?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.834
Yes, Dad, I'm here.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.869
Uh, I can't hear you.
Why are you whispering?

03:57.871 --> 04:00.606
Why are you calling
at 7:00 a.m.?

04:00.608 --> 04:04.009
Yeah, just making sure we're
still on track for my visit.

04:04.011 --> 04:04.943
What visit?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.378
For Warner's birthday party.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.347
Dad, Warner's birthday's
in eight months.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.449
Well, I just got an Evite

04:10.451 --> 04:13.185
to a surprise party
at Warner's this Friday.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.587
Dad, that's my birthday.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.358
Really?

04:19.360 --> 04:23.028
(laughs): Yes. You just ruined
a surprise party in my honor

04:23.030 --> 04:25.130
and forgot my birthday

04:25.132 --> 04:27.065
in one phone call.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
Well, you still want me to come?

04:28.902 --> 04:31.303
I'm kind of stuck
with this plane ticket.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.437
(scoffs)

04:33.373 --> 04:35.374
Fine. I'll see you
when you get here.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.708
Okay. Good.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.976
By the way,

04:37.978 --> 04:41.346
did you text me the word "no"
the other...

04:42.382 --> 04:43.815
A surprise party?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.150
I hate surprise parties.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.753
You're a terrible
girlfriend.
Oh, I thought you said

04:47.755 --> 04:49.254
I wasn't your girlfriend.
Well, whatever you are,

04:49.256 --> 04:51.256
you're terrible at it.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.725
WARNER:
<i>Yes.</i>

04:53.727 --> 04:55.460
<i>Feel it.</i>

04:56.396 --> 04:58.797
Feel the dad.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.601
How could you
invite him?

05:02.603 --> 05:03.935
Why would you do that?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.404
I'll tell you why--
because

05:05.406 --> 05:08.240
an Indian-food burp
right in my face,

05:08.242 --> 05:10.175
and it's payback time.

05:10.177 --> 05:15.280
30 seconds of burp smell does
not equal multi-day Dad visit.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.349
Hey, you send one of mine
to the hospital,

05:17.351 --> 05:19.251
I send one of yours
to the morgue.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.385
That's the Chicago way.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.423
Untouchables.
That's right. Yeah.
<i>Untouchables.</i>

05:24.425 --> 05:25.991
Besides, a couple days
with your dad

05:25.993 --> 05:27.826
is not gonna be
the end of the world.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.761
Are you kidding me?
He's the worst.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.164
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
Don't do this.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.199
No, you will lose
the bad-dad showdown.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.169
Oh, we'll see.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.870
Okay, my dad
quickly closes the laptop

05:38.872 --> 05:40.672
every time I walk into the room.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.041
I wonder why.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.811
My dad can clear his throat
for 50 minutes

05:45.813 --> 05:47.279
of a 90-minute movie.

05:47.281 --> 05:50.782
(clearing throat)

05:50.784 --> 05:52.217
(groans)

05:52.219 --> 05:54.453
My dad is in debt
on three continents,

05:54.455 --> 05:55.787
including Antarctica.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.889
Who loans money there?

05:57.891 --> 06:00.292
My dad's a light-kiss-
on-the-lips dad.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.361
Mwah!

06:02.363 --> 06:03.628
My dad squandered away
the family fortune,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.330
and now he has to live with me.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.799
My dad divorced my mom and left
the country when I was five.

06:07.801 --> 06:13.004
(imitating gun firing)
(imitating
bullets ricocheting)

06:13.006 --> 06:14.573
Sorry.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.575
Look, you're lucky your
dads are American.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.312
My dad beat me with a
math book till I was 16.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.180
Well, see, there you go,
th-that's exactly why

06:22.182 --> 06:24.383
we need your help on Friday
when we pitch

06:24.385 --> 06:27.052
to the Chinese investors.
Because of my intimate knowledge
of Chinese culture?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.320
No. Because
you're gonna dress up

06:28.322 --> 06:29.588
like a sexy Asian schoolgirl.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.992
I can't do that.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.327
Oh, you can.
Sure you can.

06:35.329 --> 06:37.229
Here, uh, practice with me.
(clears throat, sniffs)

06:37.231 --> 06:39.598
(high-pitched giggling)

06:59.919 --> 07:01.486
This you?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.389
What?!

07:04.391 --> 07:06.358
No, that's not me!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.026
That's the kid from <i>Mask,</i>

07:08.028 --> 07:11.229
one of the ugliest people
in human history.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.731
I don't know.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.601
He looks like you
in the face parts.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.705
There's my birthday boy.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.907
WOMAN:
Eli,

07:21.909 --> 07:24.242
is okay I coming
on 2:30 next week?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.244
Are you asking me or telling me?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.446
Okay, thank you.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.885
Why does your bag say:

07:33.887 --> 07:36.321
"Say 'yes' to
breast cancer"?

07:36.323 --> 07:37.989
It was a misprint.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.059
They were giving
them away at a 5K.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.461
You did a 5K?

07:42.463 --> 07:44.830
There was free water every K.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.167
I just got in my car
and drove K to K.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.269
So, you want to flip
for the bed?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.271
Dad, there is no
way you're sleeping

07:53.273 --> 07:55.006
in my... Heads, heads,
heads, heads, heads!

07:55.008 --> 07:57.509
See you in the morning.
(Eli groans)

07:59.679 --> 08:01.947
Stay out of the bathroom
between 3:00 and 4:00.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.648
That's my go time.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.189
All right,
are you ready

08:11.191 --> 08:13.325
to dazzle those
Chinese investors?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.693
What is this?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.661
It's your helmet. You're
a rock-and-roll American

08:16.663 --> 08:18.597
who rides a motorcycle.
No.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.698
Yes!
No!

08:19.700 --> 08:21.800
No more characters.
Come on,

08:21.802 --> 08:23.201
you come into
that meeting late,

08:23.203 --> 08:24.603
wearing this helmet--
it says to them:

08:24.605 --> 08:26.605
"I don't care if I die
riding a motorcycle.

08:26.607 --> 08:30.275
I just want to make
great video games."

08:30.277 --> 08:32.944
If I don't care if I die,

08:32.946 --> 08:35.914
why am I wearing a helmet?

08:41.821 --> 08:45.023
Well, hello, kitty.
(chuckles)

08:45.025 --> 08:46.491
(continues chuckling)

08:46.493 --> 08:48.493
It's-it's good.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.562
Like, it's... it's pretty,
and you, like...

08:50.564 --> 08:52.964
like, it works,
and I like it. It's...

08:52.966 --> 08:56.368
Stop... filing this away.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.137
I can't. I'm sorry.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.373
I just promoted myself
to VP of game development,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.475
and I'm taking next week off.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.377
We, uh... we really
want to thank you

09:05.379 --> 09:07.646
for your sacrifice
and your teamwork--

09:07.648 --> 09:09.915
okay, now I'm
filing it away.
(groans)

09:11.218 --> 09:15.020
there's another very big
business meeting going on today.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.255
Oh, that's right--
our dads are having lunch.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.658
Who do you think
picks up that check?

09:19.660 --> 09:23.161
Oh, I say check placed on table
followed by a long pause.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.764
And then at least
two fake bathroom trips.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.866
I've seen my dad
physically nudge a check

09:27.868 --> 09:29.200
towards the other person.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.169
Does one of them die there?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.837
(gasps)
Do both of them die there?

09:32.839 --> 09:33.939
Oh.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.277
So, you got your
whole office in there?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.212
Yeah, pretty nearly, yeah.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.214
I just came
from a very interesting...

09:43.216 --> 09:45.250
very interesting,
in fact, meeting

09:45.252 --> 09:48.219
with an outfit that owns the
copyright to Black Santa Claus,

09:48.221 --> 09:49.588
of all things.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.258
They're going to make a fortune
for the right investor.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.460
Investing!
Giving your money to someone.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.429
Here you go,
stranger with a tie.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.131
I was hoping you could turn
my money into more money,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.734
but if you can't,
I'll understand.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.035
Look at our sons.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.971
Their stock has
never been higher,

10:05.973 --> 10:09.074
and with my help,
they're gonna go global.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.208
In fact,

10:10.210 --> 10:13.812
today they are meeting
with some Orientals.

10:27.259 --> 10:31.429
So... what time is
this birthday party tonight?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.999
Oh, I think
it's at, uh, 7:00.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.770
I thought it was at 7:30.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.171
(coughs)

10:40.173 --> 10:42.507
(sputters)

10:46.245 --> 10:47.412
(exhales):
Ah...

10:47.414 --> 10:49.514
Let me check my day planner.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.186
Yes, I have 7:00.

10:55.188 --> 10:59.024
Well, 7:00, 7:30--
what does it matter?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.558
(sneezes loudly)

11:07.433 --> 11:09.934
So, the one thing
that we learned

11:09.936 --> 11:12.437
from the success
of-of <i>Kill Hitler</i>

11:12.439 --> 11:16.174
is that... people
love killing Hitler.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.644
So, i-in <i>Kill Hitler 2,</i>

11:19.646 --> 11:23.548
there are 45 new ways
that you can kill Hitler.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.018
Check it out.
You can hang Hitler.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.555
You can electrocute Hitler.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.957
(groaning)

11:32.959 --> 11:34.893
You can even impale Hitler
with a menorah.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.896
What the <i>heil? </i>
<i>(groans)</i>

11:41.467 --> 11:44.636
(giggles)

11:44.638 --> 11:46.938
(camera clicks)

11:52.011 --> 11:55.013
(speaking Chinese)

11:55.015 --> 11:56.314
We like
what we're hearing

11:56.316 --> 11:58.483
and want very much
to work with you

11:58.485 --> 12:00.719
and your rock-and-roll
American rebel man.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.488
That's fantastic.
That's great.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.423
ELI:
Thank you. Thank you
so mu... so much.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.558
Uh, lock the door.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.393
Lock the door. Lock the door.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.931
Warner! Open up.
I'm here to help.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.000
No, no, Dad, we just sealed
a handshake agreement.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.203
(scoffs)
Then you've got nothing.
Okay.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.337
Listen,

12:19.339 --> 12:20.705
go to my office.
There's a granola bar

12:20.707 --> 12:22.373
in the top drawer.
No, no, no. No, Warner,

12:22.375 --> 12:24.342
the Chinese are-are a lovely
and honorable people,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.044
but you can't trust 'em.
Dad, please.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.378
Dad, please,

12:27.380 --> 12:31.783
stop it!
There's a reason
Shanghai's a verb.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.319
Daddy, no!

12:38.357 --> 12:40.959
CAMILA:
<i>I can't believe they didn't</i>
<i>want to invest millions</i>

12:40.961 --> 12:43.428
with a guy who says,
"Daddy, no!"

12:48.634 --> 12:51.202
Well, it was kind of
my dad's fault

12:51.204 --> 12:54.038
for showing up in the
first place, don't you think?

12:54.040 --> 12:58.143
Okay, see, this is your fault
because you never confront him.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.878
I can't yell at him.
It's like...

12:59.880 --> 13:03.148
it's like yelling at a golden
retriever with a briefcase.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.985
Boy, that went south
in a heartbeat today, didn't it?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.319
(laughs)

13:08.321 --> 13:10.388
Ah, but don't you worry.
They'll be back.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.758
I have been in this position
many, many times before.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.295
They-they told us never
to call them again.
(chuckles)

13:17.297 --> 13:21.332
Yeah. Don't you just love
the dance? (chuckles)

13:21.334 --> 13:24.836
So you don't think
that was a total disaster today?

13:24.838 --> 13:28.840
Would I be celebrating with your
last beer if I thought that?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.643
Look, Dad, this is really
difficult for me to say,

13:31.645 --> 13:33.945
but I'm gonna say it.
I'm gonna say it right now.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.680
Camila thinks you, uh,
ruined the deal today.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.486
(doorbell rings)

13:42.588 --> 13:44.589
Surprise!

13:44.591 --> 13:46.491
(chuckles)
Hi, guys.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.426
You must be Warner.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.329
Yeah. Don't learn my name.
It's easier that way.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.431
Mwah!

13:53.433 --> 13:54.999
Hi, Warner.

13:57.937 --> 14:01.506
Did you taste the tuna
that he had for breakfast?

14:02.808 --> 14:05.310
Mm-hmm. And it would have been
a billion-dollar deal

14:05.312 --> 14:06.611
if somebody had told me

14:06.613 --> 14:11.416
the correct pronunciation
is "Shiite Muslim."

14:13.452 --> 14:16.354
Well, Eli,
I propose a toast.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.456
Dad, no talking.
Just enjoy the free food.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.225
Uh, speech!

14:20.227 --> 14:23.228
Speech!
(chuckles)
Thank you, Warner.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.163
And thanks
to your beautiful maid

14:25.165 --> 14:26.631
for making
all this food.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.133
I'm his wife.
Well,

14:29.135 --> 14:31.636
when Eli was born

14:31.638 --> 14:34.305
and came out with red hair,
I couldn't believe he was mine,

14:34.307 --> 14:37.675
so I had his mother
take a paternity test.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.310
Come on, Dad.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.413
(chuckling):
Paternity test?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.249
The test determined
that I was the father,

14:44.251 --> 14:47.585
but with technology back then,
who knows?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.354
He doesn't.
(chuckles)

14:49.356 --> 14:51.356
Happy birthday, Eli.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.392
Wow, awesome toast.
There's a lot of love there.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.195
And here's your gift.
Oh.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.330
Well...
(clears throat)

14:59.332 --> 15:01.432
(scoffs)

15:04.703 --> 15:07.538
My birthday gift is a
framed photo of you?

15:07.540 --> 15:10.108
You don't like it?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.011
Eh, you look like a
disgraced science teacher.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.546
Well, that's pretty ungrateful.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.682
What am I supposed
to be grateful for?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.951
The time you introduced
me to a woman named Deb

15:19.953 --> 15:23.888
as my new mom and then broke up
with her 20 minutes later?

15:23.890 --> 15:26.991
We grew apart.

15:27.893 --> 15:31.329
Hey-o!
(chuckles)

15:32.364 --> 15:34.365
What about when, uh,
you shaved my head

15:34.367 --> 15:36.034
before we went
to Disneyland?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.937
We got a free lunch with Goofy,
didn't we?

15:43.475 --> 15:45.376
It's not funny, Dad.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.312
You can't just make a
joke out of everything.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.248
Well, if I don't, who will?
Not you.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.317
You've got your mother's
sense of humor,

15:52.319 --> 15:55.253
i.e. none.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.256
Well, here's something
you might find funny:

15:58.258 --> 16:01.926
I'm leaving my own birthday
party because of you.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.494
Good night, everybody!

16:06.432 --> 16:08.933
There was a sleeping child
in the room I stormed into.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.234
BOY (crying):
Daddy!

16:10.236 --> 16:12.303
I thought he was the bed
with the coats on it,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.138
so I grabbed him really hard.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.111
BRITISH NARRATOR:
And so this new wave
of anti-Semitism led

16:20.113 --> 16:21.913
to what became known
as the Granada Massacre
(door opens)

16:21.915 --> 16:25.516
of 1066. Some 1,500

16:25.518 --> 16:27.285
Jewish families
were slaughtered and those

16:27.287 --> 16:30.688
left behind were forced to pay
the newly imposed poll tax...

16:30.690 --> 16:32.690
(David clears throat loudly)

16:32.692 --> 16:35.593
In many ways, the event
was mirrored in 1840

16:35.595 --> 16:38.763
by what is commonly known
as the Damascus Affair,

16:38.765 --> 16:40.798
in which Middle Eastern Jews
were blamed

16:40.800 --> 16:45.803
for the disappearance
of a French monk and his scribe.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.505
Kristallnacht,
also known as the Night

16:47.507 --> 16:51.142
of the Broken Glass, was
a series of coordinated attacks

16:51.144 --> 16:53.277
against the Jews
throughout Nazi Germany

16:53.279 --> 16:55.847
and parts of Austria in November

16:55.849 --> 16:59.584
of 1938...
(clears throat)

17:14.066 --> 17:16.300
(bell dings)

17:16.302 --> 17:18.336
What you playing?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.405
<i>Punch the Puerto Rican?</i>

17:23.208 --> 17:25.209
No, it's a boxing game
we're developing.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.844
It doesn't have
a name yet.
Uh-huh.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.479
Well, jot down "Punch
the Puerto Rican."

17:28.481 --> 17:32.250
Let the marketing people
take it from there.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.520
Hey, Dad, you know
we don't work together, right?

17:35.522 --> 17:38.322
Well, you and I have a very
special relationship.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.658
You know, I see David
and Eli going at it,

17:40.660 --> 17:44.062
and I just think,
"Wow, how lucky we are."

17:44.064 --> 17:47.265
I mean, we just...
get along. (chuckles)

17:47.267 --> 17:52.003
Look, Dad, I-I know
you think we get along, but...

17:52.005 --> 17:54.105
Yes, son?

18:05.417 --> 18:08.686
(sighs)

18:08.688 --> 18:10.621
No, you're right.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.757
We do get along.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.960
I love you, buddy.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.198
And I love you, too, son.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.201
Well, ups and downs,
but we came out

18:23.203 --> 18:24.469
on the other side.
Bye, Dad!

18:24.471 --> 18:27.772
I'll call you
next week. Yeah.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.309
All right.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.443
Bye.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.878
Take those calcium pills.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.947
You have a good one, Dad!

18:35.949 --> 18:38.316
(whoops loudly)

18:41.453 --> 18:43.955
Taxi!

18:45.224 --> 18:46.958
(knocking)

18:49.495 --> 18:51.562
Dad, what are you doing?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.064
How did you know I was here?

18:53.066 --> 18:55.399
Well, I hit a red light
on the way out of the airport.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.802
¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(humming)

18:57.804 --> 18:59.871
(humming)

19:04.276 --> 19:07.445
No. No!

19:07.447 --> 19:09.580
What are you doing?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.183
Go back!

19:12.185 --> 19:13.417
Go back!

19:13.419 --> 19:16.487
We made a deal!

19:20.259 --> 19:22.593
So what's going on, Dad?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.195
Why aren't you going back home?

19:24.197 --> 19:28.099
The truth is, there's no home
to go back to.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.768
I couldn't make the last
few payments on the condo

19:30.770 --> 19:32.803
and the bank took it back.
What?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.373
Why didn't you come to me?
I would've loaned you the money.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.109
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that would be?

19:38.111 --> 19:41.279
Look, I guess I was just hoping
that I could stay with you,

19:41.281 --> 19:43.314
like Warner's dad
stays with him.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.616
Then we started
arguing, and I knew

19:45.618 --> 19:48.319
it wasn't gonna
happen, so here I am.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.522
Look, Dad, I'm sorry
that we fight. It's just...

19:51.524 --> 19:53.558
(sighs)

19:53.560 --> 19:57.828
Sometimes... I feel like
you're rooting for me to fail.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.665
And that's terrifying.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.633
I'm the one who's failed.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.635
Failed to
keep my home,

20:04.637 --> 20:08.406
failed to stay with your mom,
failed to be a real dad to you.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.174
Oh, come on.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.642
You're gonna deny those things?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.378
No, but I'm gonna say,
"Oh, come on."

20:18.350 --> 20:20.651
(sighs)
Look, Dad,

20:20.653 --> 20:23.721
it's not too late.
I mean, we can try.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.061
Come on. Get your stuff.
Let's get out of this place.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.396
You can stay with me.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.198
Really?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.334
Yeah.
Thanks.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.369
I love you, Eli.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.404
Oh. Yeah. Uh...
(sputters)

20:40.406 --> 20:42.273
Big-time ditto.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.477
(sighs)

20:48.780 --> 20:50.114
Mwah!
(groans)

20:53.185 --> 20:57.622
And this is their ethnically
and sexually diverse workplace.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.024
(chuckles)

21:00.026 --> 21:01.292
Where's your gay guy?

21:01.294 --> 21:03.828
Show him your gay guy.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.635
You know, we actually had
to expand into this office

21:10.637 --> 21:13.037
a couple months ago because
the company's growing so fast.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.740
Yeah, things are
going great now, but...
Dad.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.843
What? I was just gonna say
someday they won't be.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.214
Guys, I think I
fixed your screwup.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.482
The deal with the Chinese
is back on.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.450
What? That's amazing.
How?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.319
Oh, that creepy translator
texted me a picture

21:28.321 --> 21:31.489
of his tiny penis,
so I threatened to put it online

21:31.491 --> 21:34.592
unless he convinced the
investors to approve the deal.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.960
(chuckles)

21:36.928 --> 21:38.329
Nice! All right.
(Veronica chuckles)

21:38.331 --> 21:39.297
All right, let's see it.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.833
(clears throat)

21:42.835 --> 21:46.971
It looks like something
you'd pick out of a salad.

21:48.407 --> 21:53.077
It looks like a cashew
on a shag carpet.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.612
And this was the
best photo he took.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.981
Can you imagine the other
nine he deleted to get here?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.149
(Veronica chuckles)

22:00.252 --> 22:02.586
This is nice.

22:02.588 --> 22:06.157
This is really, really nice.

22:07.492 --> 22:12.930
Now, I see an inchworm
and a little tiny fireman's hat.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.033
Oh, I see it.
Oh, yeah, I
see it, too.
