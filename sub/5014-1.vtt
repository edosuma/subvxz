00:05.020 --> 00:09.309
<i>The world of Altera is about to change.</i>

00:09.460 --> 00:13.704
<i>Altera is a land divided
among humans, elves,</i>

00:13.820 --> 00:17.029
<i>and beasts and dragons.</i>

00:17.220 --> 00:22.226
<i>Decades ago, the elves and humans
drove the beasts and dragons</i>

00:22.380 --> 00:24.621
<i>back into the dark mountains.</i>

00:27.460 --> 00:31.909
<i>Evil thrives on darkness
and draws strength from it.</i>

00:32.060 --> 00:37.783
<i>Rage and fury gathers in the gem
possessed by the Black Dragon,</i>

00:37.900 --> 00:41.143
<i>Waiting for the dragon to reawaken.</i>

00:46.220 --> 00:51.750
<i>In recent years, human and elves
have been fighting for territory,</i>

00:51.860 --> 00:55.387
<i>and because of this
they cannot see the common enemy</i>

00:55.500 --> 00:58.470
<i>and the greater evil coming their way.</i>

01:00.260 --> 01:03.469
<i>But Nerwin the elf princess
can see the growing storm</i>

01:03.580 --> 01:07.027
<i>and thinks Altera's only hope
is to forget the past</i>

01:07.140 --> 01:09.029
<i>and ally with the humans.</i>

01:09.140 --> 01:13.270
<i>She has decided
to act on her own, in secret.</i>

01:13.380 --> 01:16.941
<i>Courageous, but foolish.</i>

01:17.060 --> 01:22.066
- There's something here. I sense it.
- Humans? We're still in elf territory.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.708
No one knows our plan.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.104
What?

01:53.820 --> 01:55.106
Huh?

01:55.260 --> 02:00.471
Why do you even try?
Your skills are no match for mine.

02:00.580 --> 02:04.551
- Princess Elena!
- Princess Elena? How did she find us?

02:07.380 --> 02:12.068
So, you're Liya. You should join me.
Soon I will be the ruler of Altera.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.827
- It's time for elves to rule.
- Close your mind to her.

02:17.940 --> 02:21.069
- She can enchant.
- Nerwin, beware.

02:21.260 --> 02:24.946
The beasts are on the move
and the Black Dragon will wake soon.

02:25.700 --> 02:30.262
You want an alliance with the humans?
That's charming, but pathetic.

02:30.380 --> 02:34.271
I have a plan.
Soon I will rule this world.

02:34.380 --> 02:37.350
It's time for elves to rule.

02:55.540 --> 02:59.101
Mm, chicken leg. Time to eat.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.505
Beasts?

03:08.620 --> 03:10.270
Not me! Not me!

03:12.580 --> 03:14.708
Whoa, real beasts.

03:16.329 --> 03:21.462
Destroy. Destroy. Burn.

03:21.580 --> 03:25.869
- Kill!
- Lunch is postponed.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.409
- Human meat.
- Roast them all.

03:29.460 --> 03:30.586
- Hungry.
- Hungry.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.190
I must beat them to Carderock.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.541
- Human!
- Nice to meet you too! Bye!

03:41.660 --> 03:44.869
- That way!
- Get him!

03:55.540 --> 03:56.951
There!

04:25.660 --> 04:27.230
Human!

04:34.580 --> 04:36.309
Jump!

04:38.540 --> 04:40.224
This is not good.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.301
Situation not improving.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.709
This is not my day.

05:26.260 --> 05:30.060
- Trapped! Eat raw.
- Tasty meat.

05:30.180 --> 05:35.505
Food? You want food?
I have a chicken leg. This is really tasty.

05:35.660 --> 05:39.107
No! Eat human. You food!

05:40.580 --> 05:43.470
So good! Arm! Wing!

05:43.620 --> 05:46.385
No, really, I promise you,
it's delicious.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.547
- Dead end!
- Dead end.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.226
- Mine! Mine!
- No, mine.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.950
- Mine.
- No, mine!

05:52.060 --> 05:53.710
Mine, mine.

05:55.220 --> 05:58.429
- Dead end.
- Dead end? Not a dead end for me.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.464
But it's definitely a dead end for you.

06:01.580 --> 06:05.505
I brought you guys here on purpose.
You're the ones who are trapped.

06:05.620 --> 06:09.944
Altera's best warriors are almost here
and that makes this the end for you.

06:10.060 --> 06:15.385
Come on out, soldiers!
Number One, Number Two, attack!

06:22.940 --> 06:27.582
Faster, faster! I hope they believe me.

06:28.820 --> 06:34.031
Get out fast.
Beasts are in our forest. Go south!

06:34.180 --> 06:36.228
Beasts are coming?

06:42.380 --> 06:45.350
Arrows. Fire.

06:59.860 --> 07:02.261
Tasty. Oh, boy.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.070
One, Two, come on!

07:09.180 --> 07:10.994
Human.

07:13.860 --> 07:17.865
Hey, I'm pretty skinny.
The bigger, fatter humans went that way.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.904
- I'll show you where they are.
- Liar! Good enough.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.425
Yeah! On the spit.

07:24.780 --> 07:27.465
- You sure you want to do this?
- Make him scream!

07:27.580 --> 07:33.030
- On the fire.
- I hate unfair fights!

07:33.140 --> 07:35.302
What?

07:53.260 --> 07:54.750
Number One, Two, come on!

07:58.660 --> 07:59.946
Come on!

08:11.700 --> 08:14.180
Help! Help!

08:20.980 --> 08:26.066
They're OK! Great.
Hey, guys. Good you made it.

08:27.620 --> 08:31.750
Don't worry. This is weird.
I'll figure this out.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.703
Oh, no.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.701
Where? What the...

08:53.340 --> 08:55.342
- I caught a fish.
- Fish?

08:55.500 --> 08:58.788
- Grab the sword, fish!
- Who are you?

09:01.037 --> 09:04.110
You look like a fighter.

09:04.220 --> 09:06.621
Let's see what you can do
with a wooden sword.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.710
Those beasts were going
to have you for lunch.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.505
But I saved your butt. You owe me.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.067
I could throw you back,
but this is going to be fun!

09:19.060 --> 09:22.223
Your defense is weak.
It's full of holes.

09:22.340 --> 09:26.664
With a real sword,
you'd be dead already. Come on!

09:26.780 --> 09:31.149
Lose your balance, you lose your life.
Think you're hiding?

09:32.820 --> 09:36.029
Sloppy, weak, late.

09:36.140 --> 09:41.749
A wager. You hit me just once,
I buy you a real sword.

09:44.060 --> 09:47.860
That's not fighting, that's tickling.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.629
You can't hide from your fate, fish.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.267
See?

10:11.820 --> 10:15.870
Smoked fish. Smells pretty good.

10:15.980 --> 10:19.063
Dead? I killed him already?

10:20.460 --> 10:21.621
That's cheating!

10:25.300 --> 10:27.826
- Not bad.
- I would say I won.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.202
- But are you sure?
- Huh?

10:35.940 --> 10:39.990
What to do with you now? Stop this!

10:40.100 --> 10:43.422
Varnak, are you done
with your little game?

10:44.660 --> 10:48.426
Varnak? The famous mercenary? Varnak?

10:48.580 --> 10:49.706
That's me.

10:49.820 --> 10:54.450
- Wow! I just beat Varnak!
- Beat me?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.985
I was just having some fun, Gerrant.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.944
And you're Gerrant,
the famous dragon fighter.

11:02.100 --> 11:06.310
Brother, look what else came
flying aboard. Let's keep them.

11:06.420 --> 11:10.027
Argenta has a weakness
for small creatures.

11:10.140 --> 11:14.304
Creatures? Those are great soldiers.
We're unbeatable.

11:14.460 --> 11:17.031
They're my best friends
and if you team up with us,

11:17.140 --> 11:19.825
we'll send those beasts back
to the dark mountains.

11:19.940 --> 11:25.310
- We can't return now.
- OK. I have no choice. It's your ship.

11:25.420 --> 11:29.470
Alright, guys, no matter what,
we are a team. This is fun, guys, huh?

11:29.620 --> 11:33.511
And Varnak, you owe me that sword.
A really good sword. A big sword.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.062
- A great sword!
- Fish, you barely touched me.

11:37.180 --> 11:40.184
- Varnak, we all saw it.
- Whose side are you on?

11:40.300 --> 11:44.100
- I was just kidding around.
- A really great sword!

11:47.420 --> 11:52.665
Alliance? We're enemies.
And have been for years.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.544
Altera will not survive, your highness.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.027
Princess, this is the human palace.

11:57.140 --> 12:01.464
Priest! Why don't you save that
for the beast, Terram?

12:03.820 --> 12:07.063
If it weren't for Nerwin's reputation,
I wouldn't be here either.

12:07.220 --> 12:11.020
That's enough from you, witch.
You have no official standing here.

12:11.180 --> 12:15.071
- Is that clear?
- Stop! Let her speak.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.751
Not that I believe
any elf words, anyway.

12:17.860 --> 12:22.821
Your highness, you may not trust
the elves, but the elfin map does not lie.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.824
The Black Dragon's forces
are moving across the land.

12:25.940 --> 12:29.023
You humans know that
if the dragon wakes from hibernation,

12:29.180 --> 12:31.069
it will be stronger than ever.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.581
This may be the last chance for Altera.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.468
- I beg you, your highness.
- Princess!

12:37.580 --> 12:40.868
Now is the time to forget the past
and form an alliance.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.709
We must kill the Black Dragon.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.107
Nerwin is right.
There's no time to waste.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.308
- We must act.
- Kasarana, you're out of line.

12:47.420 --> 12:50.822
Altera is in danger.
We are all in danger.

12:55.820 --> 13:00.587
It's true, the elves and the sorceresses
cannot be trusted.

13:00.740 --> 13:04.825
But we priests sense this evil, too.
Perhaps it is time for an alliance.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.828
Dragons and beasts. Beasts and dragons.

13:09.940 --> 13:13.103
They were defeated by us decades ago.

13:13.220 --> 13:17.111
Now you want me to go to war,
just because of some map?

13:17.220 --> 13:19.621
What kind of joke is this?

13:22.540 --> 13:26.784
Iron soft as butter when heated.
Just like a human heart.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.028
Just like the heart of a warrior.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.144
Tough when cold. Soft when hot.

13:32.260 --> 13:37.027
A big shield for ten gold pieces,
the best sword for ten gold pieces.

13:37.140 --> 13:40.667
Old man, I need to buy this boy a sword.
The cheaper, the better.

13:41.860 --> 13:45.581
Hang on, that wasn't the deal.
I want the best sword.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.423
Never seen you buy a sword
for anyone, Varnak.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.584
Why, you! This kid is unusual.

13:55.780 --> 14:01.025
I've seen him take on a dozen beasts
with just a dagger.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.905
He can even stand up
to a dragon, I'll bet.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.381
And with his skill,

14:06.500 --> 14:10.505
he only needs a sword
that costs five gold pieces.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.951
Mm-hmm. Huh?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.666
What have you got for five gold pieces?

14:14.820 --> 14:18.791
I only make the best.
But I can make one for you for seven.

14:18.900 --> 14:25.784
- How about just a little cheaper?
- Seven gold... and three for the hilt.

14:26.780 --> 14:30.421
What?! That's ten.
Do you think I'm stupid?

14:30.540 --> 14:32.190
Forget it, I'm not even going to buy it.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.302
You have no choice!
You have to buy it. I beat you!

14:34.420 --> 14:39.221
Famous Varnak, beaten by a young boy
and now trying to cheat him?

14:40.660 --> 14:43.311
He cheated. He's a trickster.
Little fish.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.383
Watch out!

14:56.940 --> 14:57.987
An elf?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.504
My word, that's an elf!

15:02.660 --> 15:08.224
- She owes me an apology!
- Forget it. No one can catch an elf.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.707
Let's get her!

15:10.900 --> 15:14.143
An elf in Saint's Haven.
That is so strange.

15:14.260 --> 15:17.662
Yes, and she just paid me cash
for a dozen arrowheads.

15:17.780 --> 15:20.465
Best work I've ever done. Full price!

15:23.980 --> 15:25.425
We'll catch her.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.184
You go this way!

15:45.540 --> 15:48.623
First I beat Varnak,
now I'm going to catch an elf.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.823
Number One, Number Two, get her!

16:03.420 --> 16:06.264
That thief stole my pot! Come back here!

16:06.380 --> 16:10.988
Fast! Get out of here!
She's vicious! That was crazy.

16:14.420 --> 16:17.708
- What is this for?
- Looks like it fits you.

16:17.820 --> 16:20.710
Save it, you might need it.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.861
Yeah. Try one of your elf tricks now!
How are you going to get out of this?

16:46.820 --> 16:48.231
Don't kick. Don't. Don't.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.543
Not sure catching you was worth it.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.469
You didn't catch me! We fell.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.345
I'm the fastest human you've ever seen.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.462
You're completely hopeless.

17:09.380 --> 17:11.030
This is not looking good.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.861
- Oh, no. Bombs.
- Bombs?

17:15.020 --> 17:17.307
Tasty dessert.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.349
Hi, guys. I caught an elf.
Impressive, huh? Right over there.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.383
What are you doing? You traitor!

17:26.740 --> 17:30.631
- Elf.
- Sweet.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.902
- He's yours.
- Huh?

17:52.460 --> 17:54.303
He was mine. Come on.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.266
- Haven't seen an elf arrow before, huh?
- Careful.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.621
You'd better leave those to me.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.506
Hey, how do you do that?
You elves have so many secrets.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.908
You're a human.
I'm definitely not telling you.

18:16.540 --> 18:19.623
Oh, no. Looks like you're going
to have to trust a human now.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.865
I'll take this side.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.264
You got any training with a sword?

18:28.660 --> 18:32.426
Because I think I can handle
all this by myself.

18:32.540 --> 18:36.943
- Elves are so full of themselves.
- Let go of my hand, please.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.670
OK. Can elves fly?

18:42.900 --> 18:45.062
Touch me again and you will regret it.

18:45.180 --> 18:50.107
- Oops. You just touched me.
- I think you just touched me again.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.349
You take the slow ones.
Leave the rest for me.

19:03.420 --> 19:04.990
- Who's that?
- Hey, Gerrant!

19:14.780 --> 19:17.200
Argenta, watch out! Huh?

19:17.300 --> 19:18.711
Whoa.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.543
The Black Dragon's coming!

19:24.740 --> 19:25.980
No!

19:31.620 --> 19:33.190
Blood, meat!

19:34.820 --> 19:37.141
Kill them all.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.069
- Watch this.
- No! Stop.

19:56.540 --> 19:57.666
Take this!

20:07.660 --> 20:10.027
- No need. Wait.
- What?

20:16.460 --> 20:22.229
- Kuke, round them up!
- Yes, sir. Right now. Get them all!

20:26.780 --> 20:30.023
That beast was huge. I am incredible.

20:30.220 --> 20:33.667
You didn't do that.
It was the guy on the horse.

20:37.420 --> 20:43.109
- Gerrant, it is good to see you.
- Velskud, I have missed our friendship.

20:45.780 --> 20:48.511
These times are hard on all friendships.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.748
I'm glad you're here.
I need someone I can trust.

20:50.860 --> 20:54.091
And I see the king has promoted you.
I'm impressed.

20:57.260 --> 21:00.787
Don't be. The king has always been
more impressed with you.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.862
I don't think he's going to be impressed
after this happened in Saint's Haven.

21:04.980 --> 21:08.951
We'll tell him together,
and we can both endure his wrath.

21:10.820 --> 21:14.586
No! Velskud! Is that a beast helmet?

21:16.140 --> 21:19.940
Yes, it was an unexpected
beast attack and we repelled it.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.471
No! Impossible!

21:21.580 --> 21:25.320
I fear it means
the Black Dragon is reviving.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.629
No, no, it can't be.

21:27.780 --> 21:32.229
Why when I am king?
Things were going so well.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.621
- We cannot ignore this any more.
- But...

21:34.740 --> 21:38.665
Your highness, now you see,
the map at all times reflects the truth.

21:39.740 --> 21:45.463
As your advisor, I reluctantly
admit that Nerwin was right.

21:45.580 --> 21:48.470
War means gold,
and me and my ship are ready.

21:49.740 --> 21:52.664
- Your highness, Gerrant.
- Argenta.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.906
At your service.

21:54.020 --> 21:59.504
The time has come. Altera must unite.
You must decide.

22:02.280 --> 22:06.384
Yes, an alliance,
but only under my banner.

22:06.500 --> 22:10.300
Elves, if you agree, summon your troops.

22:32.620 --> 22:38.229
Number Two! Where did you go?
Number One, Number Two!

22:40.780 --> 22:43.704
Number One! Number Two!

22:49.780 --> 22:51.020
Ow!

23:09.820 --> 23:10.946
Wow.

23:13.620 --> 23:16.863
I hope we can celebrate
at the end of this, too.

23:19.841 --> 23:22.341
- Have you seen my dogs?
- Dogs?

23:22.460 --> 23:26.545
Fish, you've got to prepare for battle.
Pack your things. We're off to war.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.886
You'll be swimming in gold.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.990
Don't laugh. Where are my dogs?

23:33.220 --> 23:37.384
Ah, Fish, now is the time
for you to learn.

23:37.540 --> 23:41.989
Life is unpredictable and really brutal.

23:50.500 --> 23:57.042
There you are! Number One! Number Two!
I found you! I'm so happy to see you!

23:57.260 --> 23:58.264
Hey!

24:01.540 --> 24:03.065
What is this?

24:03.180 --> 24:05.990
Er... yeah, yeah.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.467
The old man thinks they're really cute.

24:08.580 --> 24:13.647
What? No, you traded them for the sword
for the kid. And that's the truth.

24:15.820 --> 24:16.867
You what?

24:17.980 --> 24:21.701
Fish, you would be wise
to stay here and train with me, too.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.630
- Blacksmithing is a good skill to know.
- Blacksmith?

24:24.740 --> 24:26.788
Don't listen to anything he says.
Nothing he says.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.870
My advice is that the boy
and the dogs stay here with me.

24:29.980 --> 24:34.269
It is safer here and he won't be
of any good to you where you're going.

24:34.420 --> 24:38.186
Stay here? I'm training him
to be a warrior.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.347
Think about it, Varnak.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.663
He is small and will be
the first target of the beasts.

24:42.780 --> 24:46.830
They will show him no mercy
and these dogs will never see him again.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.984
Varnak saved my life.
I must be loyal to him.

24:50.100 --> 24:56.028
Guys, this is goodbye.
It's too dangerous out there for you.

24:57.220 --> 25:03.102
I'll earn a lot of gold and I will
buy both of you back. I promise.

25:04.340 --> 25:08.470
Blacksmith, these are my best friends
and now they're in your care.

25:08.580 --> 25:13.029
You've got to make me your very best
sword, no matter the cost.

25:14.180 --> 25:18.310
Number One, Number Two, be good.
Make me proud. No tears.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.350
Ignore the kid.
The price doesn't change. Got it?

25:22.700 --> 25:24.145
Boy's got a big heart.

25:24.260 --> 25:28.629
He will make a lousy warrior
because he will always just follow it.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.263
Mind your own business!
Stick to making swords.

25:37.380 --> 25:41.180
Cute dogs. They yours?
They seem to like you.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.667
I got something in my eyes.
What's that over there?

25:47.140 --> 25:51.589
A warrior, crying over dogs?
That's quite charming.

25:52.620 --> 25:58.787
- You just leave me alone, OK?
- Alright, I'll leave you alone.

26:11.860 --> 26:14.545
Hey! What did you shoot at?

26:20.260 --> 26:22.342
Whoa! Whoa!

26:25.500 --> 26:30.142
- Whoa! Careful. Don't shoot me.
- There was someone up here.

26:31.460 --> 26:34.464
There was a statue.

26:37.380 --> 26:42.989
- Relax. I won't tell anyone.
- I know I saw something moving.

26:44.180 --> 26:48.549
Hey. Come here. Look.
Now, that's a dinner we should be at.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.903
Yes, well, last time
I heard from you people,

26:52.060 --> 26:56.463
the Black Dragon was locked
in the mountains for 100 years.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.185
Who can I trust here?

26:58.300 --> 27:03.181
If the beasts are attacking,
that means the dragon could wake soon.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.746
The danger is great.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.781
Nothing to be scared of.
I say fly there and kill it!

27:11.900 --> 27:14.141
Its resting place is heavily defended.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.946
And it's also protected
by a treacherous mountain range.

27:18.060 --> 27:21.826
Are you saying
you can't beat those beasts?

27:21.940 --> 27:24.068
Their forces are much larger than ours.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.144
We can't face the beasts
and the Black Dragon at the same time.

27:27.260 --> 27:30.742
After all these years of hibernation,
the dragon will be a fearsome foe.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.670
And if we get to it before it wakes?

27:33.780 --> 27:36.784
I fear any close approach
will awaken it.

27:36.940 --> 27:39.864
So, you mean to say...
Well, in that case, we're all dead!

27:40.900 --> 27:42.868
The dragon does have a weakness.

27:42.980 --> 27:46.223
Its awesome power
comes from a gem in its chest.

27:46.340 --> 27:50.504
Remove the gem,
and the dragon is vulnerable.

27:50.700 --> 27:55.228
- Yes, that's right.
- A gem. I wonder what that's worth.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.549
Legend has it the gem has great powers.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.783
It can kill and it can revive the dead.

28:01.900 --> 28:06.622
Your highness, this gem should belong
to the humans here in Saint's Haven.

28:06.740 --> 28:09.869
Terram! This must be
a mission for peace!

28:09.980 --> 28:14.463
The war is under the king's banner,
so the spoils belong to us.

28:14.620 --> 28:17.021
There's no room for black magic
from you sorceresses!

28:17.140 --> 28:20.986
Typical! First you tell the king
there's no threat,

28:21.140 --> 28:22.904
then you want all the power
for yourself.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.910
If the alliance fights,
then this is up to the king!

28:26.020 --> 28:28.910
Yes, and it's your troops
that let the beasts invade the city.

28:29.020 --> 28:31.341
Why is it that you make
all the decisions?

28:31.500 --> 28:35.425
Why should anyone trust you
with anything?! Soldier.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.868
- Kasarana, that's enough!
- Do you always fight like this?

28:38.980 --> 28:41.221
If elves join this battle,
we should have a say as well.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.109
As long as it's not the priests.

28:43.220 --> 28:48.226
I'll settle this. Get the gem
and sell it, then split the gold.

28:48.340 --> 28:51.867
Hey, hey, hey! Listen to yourselves!

28:51.980 --> 28:54.062
How can you fight like this?

28:54.180 --> 28:56.342
Take a break and listen to my idea.

28:56.460 --> 29:00.101
First, Kuke.
Kuke's army attacks from the front

29:00.220 --> 29:02.063
and draws the attention
of the beast army.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.706
- You little village rat!
- Hang on! Hang on.

29:04.860 --> 29:07.431
Meanwhile, our small group
flies on Varnak's ship.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.587
Yeah!

29:08.780 --> 29:10.828
All the way to the rear
of the dragon's nest,

29:10.940 --> 29:12.908
and we both attack at the same time!

29:15.180 --> 29:17.069
We sneak in, catch the dragon
before it wakes,

29:17.180 --> 29:21.788
make a fast attack,
grab the gem and fly back.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.390
Perfect. And guess what?

29:23.500 --> 29:27.585
I've already got one elf signed on.
We're ready to go.

29:31.700 --> 29:32.940
- Stay out!
- No!

29:34.460 --> 29:36.269
Let's listen.

29:36.380 --> 29:40.829
- Who is this kid?
- Actually, I like his plan.

29:40.980 --> 29:44.541
Velskud, what do you think?

29:46.140 --> 29:49.622
Gerrant, you know dragons the best.

29:49.860 --> 29:52.466
Even if we kill the Black Dragon
and capture the gem,

29:52.580 --> 29:55.504
this gem can corrupt the most innocent.

29:55.660 --> 30:00.621
One thing I'm sure of,
the Black Dragon gem must be destroyed.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.825
I don't think humans and elves
can work together very well.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.749
And priests and witches.

30:10.780 --> 30:13.624
But you made a big impression on them.
You should be proud.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.188
Now you see the truth. I'm the best.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.507
I'm going to be a great warrior.

30:19.620 --> 30:22.544
Human boys. I should have known better.

30:22.660 --> 30:24.310
This is not bad. Tasty.

30:38.220 --> 30:41.941
Velskud, my love, can you feel it?

30:42.060 --> 30:45.906
The plan is unfolding
just as I told you it would.

30:47.260 --> 30:52.391
You are so close to what you
always wanted. It is at hand.

30:52.500 --> 30:58.667
You will be the most powerful king
Altera has ever had.

30:58.860 --> 31:02.910
Velskud! I've got new orders for you.

31:03.060 --> 31:06.701
The Black Dragon gem should be mine.

31:06.940 --> 31:09.068
Kill the dragon and bring the gem to me.

31:09.180 --> 31:13.390
Whoever controls the black gem
will control all of Altera.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.947
And that is why
the Black Dragon gem must be mine,

31:17.060 --> 31:18.391
and you must get it for me.

31:18.500 --> 31:24.906
And I will be all-powerful.
And you will be my general.

31:25.020 --> 31:29.901
General? Our future king
has no interest in being a general.

31:30.020 --> 31:34.981
Who is that? A dark elf!
Velskud, kill her! She can't be here!

31:35.180 --> 31:39.889
- Kill her!
- Kill? I like the sound of that.

31:42.060 --> 31:47.021
Not the... the dark elf. It's...

31:49.020 --> 31:53.628
King Velskud.
It fits so well, doesn't it?

31:54.700 --> 31:59.991
The Black Dragon will wake soon.
It's time for you to leave on your mission.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.421
Wow. It's a beauty.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.622
Hey, what's so funny?

32:31.740 --> 32:36.382
You. But I think it's cute.
I like you in armor.

32:42.580 --> 32:46.266
- We will be gone before anyone knows.
- We can never be sure of that.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.907
I can get new sails out of this,
maybe even a new anchor.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.630
What's your problem, fish?
You still whining about those dogs?

33:17.780 --> 33:23.947
I let them down. But I'll return
and trade in this sword to get them back.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.221
That's what I'm going to do.

33:29.260 --> 33:33.470
Well, I bought back the dogs and paid
the blacksmith to take care of them.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.788
And you better practice with that sword,

33:36.940 --> 33:38.863
or you might not make it back
from the mission.

33:39.020 --> 33:41.830
- You'll be beast food.
- Thank you, Varnak.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.584
You have a real heart under that armor.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.543
I wouldn't go that far.

33:50.638 --> 33:53.067
No! No! No!

33:54.380 --> 33:55.870
Hang on!

33:58.820 --> 34:01.426
Get a hold! I've got it under control.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.581
What?!

34:16.260 --> 34:17.830
Liya!

34:28.380 --> 34:34.228
My ship. I didn't get paid for this.
This never happens to me!

34:38.500 --> 34:40.184
This won't stop us.

34:40.300 --> 34:43.143
Nerwin, can you find us
a way there in time?

34:43.260 --> 34:44.944
It's possible. We can make it.

34:45.100 --> 34:48.342
The terrain is bad,
but the map will guide us.

34:48.460 --> 34:53.022
Bad luck. I call it bad luck.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.744
- Get off me!
- No. My ship!

35:01.860 --> 35:04.067
Now we won't make it.
Kuke will beat us there.

35:04.220 --> 35:07.030
He will wake the Black Dragon
if he arrives first.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.660
We have no alternative.
We can't turn back.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.141
- Wait, wait.
- Here you are.

35:12.260 --> 35:15.104
- Summon an elf flying ship?
- Impossible.

35:15.220 --> 35:19.111
- Quit arguing! There's dragons to kill.
- We'll need a shorter route.

35:19.260 --> 35:22.184
Then we'll be closer to beast territory.
So which way is it?

35:22.300 --> 35:24.621
Should have brought an elf ship.

35:25.860 --> 35:30.309
Elf ship? This was
the best ship in Altera. Was.

35:44.700 --> 35:45.940
Step aside.

35:46.100 --> 35:50.788
<i>My heart beats like a weapon</i>

35:52.100 --> 35:54.831
<i>Fighting for your love</i>

35:56.940 --> 35:58.749
<i>I'm a soldier</i>

35:58.940 --> 36:00.704
<i>(I'm a soldier)</i>

36:00.860 --> 36:02.464
<i>For your love</i>

36:04.660 --> 36:06.469
<i>I'm a soldier</i>

36:06.580 --> 36:07.945
<i>(I'm a soldier)</i>

36:08.100 --> 36:14.187
<i>For your love</i>

36:18.380 --> 36:23.864
<i>My heart beats like a weapon</i>

36:23.980 --> 36:28.508
<i>I'm a soldier for your love</i>

36:30.660 --> 36:32.503
I charge double for walking.

36:42.660 --> 36:46.301
Liya, do you know
where we are now? Because...

36:46.420 --> 36:48.787
Here. We're about halfway
to the dragon nest.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.701
Halfway.

36:51.780 --> 36:55.182
I got blisters the size
of an elf's foot already.

37:00.780 --> 37:03.260
I'm the smallest one,
but I'm carrying everything.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.708
Shh! Young, dumb and noisy. Quiet.

37:06.820 --> 37:12.850
- Sorry. Sorry. What is this?
- These are the Ruins Forgotten By Time.

37:14.260 --> 37:17.981
A battle in the war between the elves
and humans was fought here.

37:18.180 --> 37:21.343
Many elves were slaughtered.

37:21.460 --> 37:26.707
The elf ghosts still inhabit this place
and no one should enter.

37:27.334 --> 37:32.285
Ghosts? I hate ghosts.
Did you say ghosts?

37:33.014 --> 37:34.601
No!

37:37.580 --> 37:40.789
- No!
- Another delay.

37:43.260 --> 37:48.505
Future king, I am watching over you.
I love you.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.021
Time is running out.
You must make them hurry.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.462
My feet are killing me
and you made me come down here.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.349
Fish, you are a disaster.

38:00.460 --> 38:03.111
I wouldn't have fallen if you didn't
load me up with everything.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.469
Stop making excuses and just move.

38:20.980 --> 38:24.063
Liya, don't touch them. Be careful.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.383
They are our kin.
They are crying out to us.

38:27.500 --> 38:31.664
They're lost. The treachery
of humans created this war.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.589
They're waiting to be freed,
but it will take some strong magic.

38:38.820 --> 38:42.427
This tragedy was not
only the fault of the humans.

38:42.580 --> 38:46.027
- Yes, it was.
- Ignore these creatures.

38:46.140 --> 38:50.509
Don't let them distract us.
The Black Dragon is our goal.

38:51.780 --> 38:55.421
They're just vapor.
I can't even swing a sword at these.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.590
Lambert's fall forced us
to take the shortest route.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.544
I don't need a map
to find the shortest way.

39:03.660 --> 39:07.205
- You are a clumsy warrior.
- I like you calling me a...

39:07.305 --> 39:08.660
Circle up!

39:08.780 --> 39:11.386
Strangers. Intruders.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.351
I'm ready.

39:19.420 --> 39:22.708
What is this I see?
Humans and elves together?

39:22.820 --> 39:25.551
It's the bat of the dark mountains.

39:25.660 --> 39:26.900
What?

39:27.020 --> 39:30.229
Pretty far from home.
Bats scout for beasts.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.030
Then we can't let him
out of here, right?

39:33.940 --> 39:36.386
Only one, should be easy to kill.

39:37.980 --> 39:43.225
Yes, indeed. Humans and elves,
a priest, a sorceress who controls fire

39:43.380 --> 39:45.906
and some other strange beings, too?

39:46.020 --> 39:47.067
You're a talker.

39:47.220 --> 39:52.909
Something important must be happening.
Humans and elves in this territory.

39:53.940 --> 39:59.231
- Bat. What do you want?
- Me? I want nothing, or little.

39:59.380 --> 40:02.429
I am very peaceful and friendly.

40:02.540 --> 40:05.544
But that's me.
I protect the dragon territory.

40:05.660 --> 40:09.870
And the beasts will be very interested
to know about this.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.506
Yes, indeed, they will want
to offer you their own welcome.

40:12.620 --> 40:16.341
They will be very interested to know
that humans and elves are together.

40:16.500 --> 40:20.266
But to keep a secret,
that will cost you.

40:20.420 --> 40:23.469
We crashed here. You can
tell your friends we're going home.

40:23.620 --> 40:27.864
Beast territory. For you, expensive.
For me, rewarding.

40:27.980 --> 40:29.869
- You'll die!
- Velskud, stop!

40:30.900 --> 40:32.709
Fun!

40:39.780 --> 40:42.067
Spread out!

40:57.940 --> 40:59.942
Not bad, but I'll finish them off.

41:10.540 --> 41:12.110
Take that.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.665
Here I come. Try and get me.

41:18.620 --> 41:19.701
Liya, don't shoot!

41:25.260 --> 41:28.582
Good shot! See if you can
force him toward me.

42:21.380 --> 42:24.111
Impossible. You'll never catch me.

42:28.060 --> 42:29.949
No. No!

42:31.860 --> 42:35.560
Got you, blabber mouth!
No giving up our position now.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.710
Looks like my fish is a flying one.

42:52.220 --> 42:56.509
He talked too much.
Liya, you were amazing.

42:56.620 --> 43:01.831
We make a great team. The best.
Without us, this mission would be over!

43:01.940 --> 43:04.784
Stow it, fish! You're the one
who got us here in the first place.

43:05.820 --> 43:08.505
I've got to admit, you're right.
But we stopped the bat.

43:08.660 --> 43:11.140
And besides, the map says
I found the shortest way.

43:11.260 --> 43:14.025
- Let's go!
- You, navigating?

43:15.900 --> 43:18.380
As long as you're not using
that sword, you're not bad.

43:18.540 --> 43:21.669
You've really got to teach me
that bow and arrow thing.

43:21.780 --> 43:24.624
That bat would have
revealed our mission.

43:24.740 --> 43:27.869
It said it saw strange beings.
What did it mean?

43:27.980 --> 43:30.460
That was just meaningless chatter,
nothing more.

43:30.620 --> 43:33.624
So, which one of you guys
is the strange creature?

43:33.740 --> 43:36.949
Because you both look
a little strange to me.

43:41.580 --> 43:44.186
We elves, we were wronged here.

43:44.300 --> 43:47.782
I will be back to free you
when I have that gem.

44:01.460 --> 44:05.346
I give up. This bow and arrow
is not my thing. I just can't do it.

44:05.460 --> 44:07.030
May I?

44:12.580 --> 44:15.789
Maybe it's this armor. It's a bit tight.

44:24.060 --> 44:25.983
Whoa.

44:32.180 --> 44:34.865
The most important thing
is not power or strength,

44:35.020 --> 44:37.102
but the heart and desire.

44:39.020 --> 44:42.547
Use your focus and intention
to get what you want.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.068
That's what we elves learn
and use in everything we do.

44:46.220 --> 44:49.144
You need to learn that.

44:49.260 --> 44:54.824
I understand power,
and I have been told I have a big heart.

44:54.940 --> 44:58.183
Humans are not to be trusted.
They have always disappointed the elves

44:58.300 --> 45:00.507
and made selfish decisions
that have hurt us.

45:00.660 --> 45:06.303
The princess told me to be careful with you.
But I sense that I can trust you.

45:06.420 --> 45:09.549
- Can I?
- Of course you can trust me.

45:09.740 --> 45:13.062
I have nothing to hide. Nerwin is wrong.

45:13.180 --> 45:16.787
We can show all the elves and humans
that we can get along.

45:16.900 --> 45:19.585
I'll be there for you
whenever you need me.

45:19.740 --> 45:22.550
We can be a team like no elf
and human has ever been before.

45:22.700 --> 45:25.510
Liya, I'm not going to disappoint you.

45:38.820 --> 45:43.508
- Liya! It's time to go.
- We have to go.

45:59.300 --> 46:03.066
The closer we get to the gem,
the more I want to change.

46:03.180 --> 46:06.582
I feel a shadow of dread
touching my whole being.

46:06.740 --> 46:10.028
We can't reveal our other side.
There would be no going back.

46:10.140 --> 46:13.189
- We have no choice now.
- Of course we do.

46:13.300 --> 46:16.986
Gerrant, they won't understand.
We'll be their enemy.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.790
Then so be it.

46:18.900 --> 46:23.542
I miss my ship. But I don't want
to hear you complain.

46:23.700 --> 46:26.704
My mouth is frozen, I can't complain.

46:26.860 --> 46:30.945
This is just a wall of ice. Are you sure
it is the entrance to the dragon nest?

46:31.060 --> 46:35.110
- The elf map cannot be wrong.
- It's here somewhere, it must be.

46:35.220 --> 46:37.427
Here, let me.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.741
Frozen feet.

46:39.860 --> 46:43.546
What do you know of the power
of the gem? Why do you fear it?

46:44.780 --> 46:46.464
I know nothing more than you.

46:47.980 --> 46:50.870
I sense you know more about it
than you say. Have you ever touched one?

46:50.980 --> 46:54.666
I know once you touch a powerful gem,
it becomes forever a part of you,

46:54.860 --> 46:56.385
good and evil.

46:56.500 --> 46:58.582
- It's here, the portal.
- Stop! Brother!

47:00.180 --> 47:03.582
Step aside. This calls for fire.

47:11.980 --> 47:16.030
The battle of the three dragons.
The symbol of the dragon race.

47:16.140 --> 47:19.701
It is a powerful seal,
holding a great evil inside.

47:19.900 --> 47:23.029
If we open it, what might be released?

47:23.140 --> 47:27.384
You're saying this is a door,
so there must be a handle, right?

47:29.300 --> 47:33.350
Varnak, wait. He's right.
There must be a secret way to open it.

47:33.460 --> 47:37.351
I see it. There, under the ice,
is another dragon symbol.

48:07.500 --> 48:11.027
Wow. It's not going to get
any warmer in here.

48:14.341 --> 48:16.180
That's not good.

48:17.860 --> 48:22.104
Sentinel Dragon,
Chaos Dragon, Void Dragon.

48:22.220 --> 48:26.191
Your reign is over,
and mine is about to start.

48:38.420 --> 48:42.903
I was not expecting this.
Everything here is frozen, like my feet.

48:48.620 --> 48:51.021
This is too easy,
and we are vulnerable here.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.007
We don't have any choice.

48:56.740 --> 48:59.664
Don't make any noise and stay alert.

49:07.620 --> 49:09.304
What is that?

49:10.940 --> 49:13.227
It is a guardian of the dragon nest.
Kill it!

49:37.060 --> 49:42.510
- Follow me. We must get out of here.
- He's right. This way.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.704
Watch out!

50:06.540 --> 50:07.951
Watch out!

50:09.180 --> 50:10.386
Liya!

50:33.060 --> 50:34.471
I'm your hero, right?

50:40.500 --> 50:43.504
Don't worry, hero. I've got you.

50:44.740 --> 50:46.026
Avalanche!

50:48.460 --> 50:49.985
I must seal this cave.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.230
What are you doing?

51:05.980 --> 51:10.383
Gerrant, don't let it happen.
They'll kill us.

51:10.500 --> 51:15.301
Argenta, I can't stop it.
It's up to us now.

51:28.420 --> 51:32.311
- You fool, Gerrant is still in there!
- We can't let those creatures out!

51:32.420 --> 51:34.104
Our whole mission will be lost.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.308
- You...
- Look.

51:40.340 --> 51:43.264
- Gerrant. Gerrant!
- It's OK.

51:44.940 --> 51:47.181
Do we still have time
to find the Black Dragon?

51:47.300 --> 51:48.347
Stay away.

51:53.740 --> 51:58.428
We're too late.
Kuke and the army are here.

51:59.460 --> 52:01.781
They're going to wake the Black Dragon.

52:41.180 --> 52:43.581
Attack!

52:45.580 --> 52:47.548
Die!

52:51.620 --> 52:54.863
Formation! Charge!

54:05.660 --> 54:08.266
Hold your position! Don't retreat!

54:10.500 --> 54:11.786
Steady.

54:24.060 --> 54:27.701
Brother, promise me we won't die here.

54:32.700 --> 54:35.021
Brother!

54:35.220 --> 54:39.669
- We failed. The whole plan is gone!
- Now what?

54:39.780 --> 54:42.067
I just want to get out of here alive.

55:02.500 --> 55:08.030
Fish, I told you before,
life is unpredictable and brutal.

55:08.140 --> 55:11.269
- And...
- This is how it ends?

55:11.380 --> 55:17.467
I'm sorry I got you into this one.
But for us, the worst is over.

55:17.580 --> 55:21.380
We're marching back to Saint's Haven
and building us a new ship.

55:21.540 --> 55:26.607
We'll fight again, I promise.
And I can get a refill on this and...

55:31.460 --> 55:33.588
Here they come.

55:42.420 --> 55:44.309
They're coming for us!

56:02.860 --> 56:04.544
I'll get this.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.906
Fall back.
Everybody fall back, fall back.

56:33.620 --> 56:35.145
There's too many of them.

56:42.820 --> 56:46.267
That won't hold for long.
Where's my fish?

56:46.420 --> 56:48.343
- Liya and Lambert are out there.
- What now?

56:48.460 --> 56:49.586
What do we do?

56:50.540 --> 56:53.589
We must help them. Quick.
We can't stay here.

56:53.700 --> 56:57.591
Where's my fish?
He can't handle this alone.

57:05.580 --> 57:07.025
Come on.

57:23.860 --> 57:25.942
Liya. Liya!

57:37.900 --> 57:40.506
- Liya!
- Lambert.

57:40.660 --> 57:42.150
Liya.

57:47.020 --> 57:48.909
- Liya!
- Lambert!

58:16.060 --> 58:18.028
Got you.

59:44.860 --> 59:46.100
Liya, no!

59:50.340 --> 59:51.626
Liya.

59:53.020 --> 59:55.022
Liya, I'm here.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.226
Oh, God.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.061
No!

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.544
Over here!

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.901
- Liya!
- Lambert!

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.829
Lambert!

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.785
Lambert!

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.110
Come on.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.744
Lambert!

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.065
Brother, no!

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.387
Gerrant.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.747
No, no, no. Stop.
Don't attack. It's Gerrant.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.540
Gerrant? That's a dragon.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.588
- I couldn't tell you the truth.
- You're a dragon.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:05.621
You're right. But I'm also human.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.183
I can control my dragon side
to do good for humans.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.549
You're a good dragon? Yeah, right.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:21.586
But we are dragons. And without us,
you're all going to die, for sure.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.344
We're your only hope.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.470
Dragons can never be good,
or the hope of humans.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.107
In this world,
nothing is completely good or evil.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.147
Dragons are evil.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.948
We're something new,
something Altera has never seen before.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.585
We are the future.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:50.149
Never. Dragons need to be
eliminated from this world.

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.460
I need a bigger sword and more gold!

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.426
Why? Why?

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.911
Why? Why can't I change?

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:11.221
Brother! Brother! Gerrant! No.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.382
Huh?

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.430
The gem can kill, and it can give life.

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:07.820
Liya, I will be back.
The Black Dragon's gem will be ours.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.149
There's no way we can kill it.
It's too big. It killed the whole army.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:28.271
Gerrant is up there fighting for us.
We must help him.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.430
- There's nothing we can do.
- We can't beat the Black Dragon.

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.588
- Kasarana.
- We're all going to die!

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.625
Kasarana. It's OK. We're not lost yet.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.430
Liya.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:53.106
I'll get the gem.
I'll fight for you! For Liya!

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.468
Fish, I'm coming to help!

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.104
Varnak! Stand up!

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:48.948
Where's my fish?

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.586
Whoa!

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.988
Dragon blood, dragon spirit.
Dragon blood, dragon spirit. Dragon...

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.621
Lambert!

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.660
We must help.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.229
Brother!

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.381
Brother!

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:45.224
- Argenta?
- Dragons fighting dragons!

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.504
My turn!

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.390
Liya!

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.829
Lambert?

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.549
I must have that gem. I must save Liya.

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.949
Lambert, stay away from me.
It's not safe.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.587
You cannot touch it.
It will destroy you.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.190
I can feel its power.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.822
I need that gem for Liya,
no matter what you say.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.104
See? It is already affecting you.
I'm going to destroy it.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.024
I will, Gerrant.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.031
If either of you touch this gem,
you will never be the same again.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.747
- You will be corrupted.
- I don't care!

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.348
But... I can give you my gem.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.950
If there is any life left in Liya,
it will revive her. Try.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.667
- But will it work?
- It should.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:19.307
But go quickly.
There needs to be a spark of life.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:29.150
Liya, Liya, I have it. I'll save you.

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.464
Liya, I love you. Come back, Liya.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.510
How does it feel to hold
the Black Dragon gem?

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.745
- Do you feel its power?
- I can feel its evil.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:56.191
But I can't withstand it too long.
You must help me destroy it.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:01.340
No, I'm not going to destroy the gem.
I'm going to destroy you, dragon!

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.663
No!

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.391
With this gem, I am going
to rule the world.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:18.181
Reign over humans, elves
and even what's left of dragons!

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.861
That gem will consume you.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:26.349
No, I will use it to destroy all of you,
and reign supreme.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.785
The gem is controlling you. Don't...

01:16:30.564 --> 01:16:34.340
The king was going to betray all of you.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.588
He was going to use
this gem for himself.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.909
That is why I killed him, too.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.661
Drop it. It's not worth it.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:47.421
I could let you all live
if you give your allegiance to me.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.346
The whole world will bow to me
and honor my will.

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:57.750
Even Elena will pay homage to the greatest
king the world has ever seen.

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.188
Elena? Does Elena have something
to do with this?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.669
My reign will last forever,
but I will never trust you!

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.902
- Your time is over.
- I am your friend.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.143
Listen. That gem is taking over
your body and soul.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.671
You will not survive.

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.384
- Shut up!
- No!

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:22.664
Velskud? Velskud, listen to your friend.

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.101
We're all your friends. Drop it.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.345
Velskud, you can't control
that kind of evil power.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:34.910
I can. I know how. Let me have it.
It will not overpower me.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.301
I will use it for all of us.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.703
- You lie. Now you die!
- No!

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:53.421
- No! Velskud, no!
- No!

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.981
Drop it, or I'll cut it from your hand.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:13.630
- You are a fish and I will gut you.
- No, you won't.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:24.429
- Surrender now, or I will finish you.
- You are a great fighter.

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:29.023
And you can have a long life
under my rule and command.

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.950
I would let you live
and be with your precious Liya.

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:37.305
But now it is your choice. Live or die?

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.461
Join your friends. Die!

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.462
I will destroy you all.
I will be all powerful.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.783
- Velskud, you can't!
- I will rule over all!

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.866
Finish him before he fully transforms.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.023
You can do it, Lambert. We need you.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.147
I'll help you, Lambert.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.141
You are dead.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:27.946
I will absorb your life, your soul.
You will be nothing.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.269
No one will remember you were alive.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:08.466
Gerrant, you were right
about the power of this gem.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.989
- I know it now.
- Velskud!

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.350
You were about to be food
for that beast.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.950
Liya? Liya!

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.461
I'm impressed.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:03.390
Without your bow and arrow,
I wouldn't have made it.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.264
Oh, Lambert.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.141
I will teach you how to use them.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:34.988
- Altera is safe again.
- Safe? What about my ship?

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.864
What about my gold?

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:40.701
We now have to ride home on an elf ship.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.983
My worst nightmare, an elf ship!

01:22:45.234 --> 01:22:46.387
Blessings.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.827
Hey, Varnak!

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.109
Altera is again at peace.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.025
Such a precious thing, peace...

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:10.380
for it is easily lost to those
who cherish other things.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.061
<i>I am the eye of your storm</i>

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.467
<i>Your lion's roar</i>

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.186
<i>On the battlefield</i>

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.588
<i>My love will be your shield</i>

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.146
<i>No cause for alarm</i>

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.469
<i>I will come to arms</i>

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.582
<i>The world could fall</i>

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.704
<i>We'd still be standing tall</i>

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:24.621
<i>And when you think all hope has gone</i>

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.746
<i>My beating heart will drive you on</i>

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.545
<i>I will fight for you</i>

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.425
<i>Give my life to you</i>

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:41.263
<i>When you can't see the sky
I will make you fly</i>

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:47.023
<i>I'll be dreaming
till I'm no longer breathing</i>

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.624
<i>Rising from the wreckage</i>

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:57.271
<i>Fighting to protect this gem of love</i>

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:01.709
<i>You're all I've ever dreamed of</i>

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.382
<i>So I'm fighting to protect this love</i>

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:12.069
<i>Our love is bulletproof</i>

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.786
<i>There's no breaking through</i>

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.426
<i>You can take your shot</i>

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.305
<i>But nothing can stop us</i>

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.230
<i>I am the moonlight star</i>

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.190
<i>Reflecting in your heart</i>

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.871
<i>If you lose the ground</i>

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.824
<i>I'll never let you down</i>

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:38.107
<i>So when you think all hope has gone</i>

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.145
<i>I will be your secret weapon</i>

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.866
<i>I will fight for you</i>

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.711
<i>Give my life to you</i>

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:53.589
<i>When you can't see the sky
I will make you fly</i>

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:59.309
<i>I'll be dreaming
till I'm no longer breathing</i>

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.990
<i>Rising from the wreckage</i>

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:09.500
<i>Fighting to protect this gem of love</i>

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:14.029
<i>You're all I've ever dreamed of</i>

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.549
<i>So I'm fighting to protect this love</i>

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:21.982
<i>This gem of love</i>

01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:27.389
<i>Oh-oh-oh</i>

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:34.464
<i>This gem of love</i>

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:37.504

Oh, stop it! Stop it! Come on, you win.

Hey! Also, I have decided.

Number One, your new name is Bow.
