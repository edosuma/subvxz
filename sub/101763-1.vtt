M_I_SForEver

00:16.097 --> 00:17.800
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

00:17.832 --> 00:19.834
Shit. Shit.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.670
Sir, could
you try to remain calm?

00:21.704 --> 00:22.772
What is your emergency?

00:22.804 --> 00:24.006
I-

00:24.039 --> 00:25.574
Let's start
by giving me your name

00:25.606 --> 00:27.309
- and your address.
- Don't tell me what to do.

00:27.342 --> 00:29.010
Don't you ever tell me
what do, do you understand?

00:29.044 --> 00:30.713
I do understand.

00:30.745 --> 00:31.980
How can I help you?

00:32.012 --> 00:33.749
I won't
let her take my kids.

00:33.781 --> 00:34.649
She can't take them.

00:34.682 --> 00:35.650
She can't. They're mine.

00:35.683 --> 00:37.485
Sir, I need
to know where you are

00:37.518 --> 00:38.987
so that I can send help.

00:39.021 --> 00:40.956
14
Independence Square.

00:40.988 --> 00:42.757
I'll fucking shoot
her if she leaves.

00:42.790 --> 00:43.858
You have to stop her.

00:43.892 --> 00:46.963
If she tries to take my
kids, I'll fucking kill her.

01:05.447 --> 01:07.350
So
what? It's chicken.

01:09.617 --> 01:10.885
Don't fucking judge me.

01:10.918 --> 01:12.420
It's not me.

01:12.453 --> 01:15.056
Adam asks his
guests all the time.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.593
Okay, what do you
have against chicken?

01:17.626 --> 01:18.761
Nothing. Nothing.

01:18.793 --> 01:20.096
Bake it, fry it, barbecue it.

01:20.129 --> 01:22.731
Just don't put it in a taco.

01:22.765 --> 01:24.933
You're crazy, it's delicious.

01:24.966 --> 01:26.868
Oh, my god, whatever.
You know what?

01:26.902 --> 01:28.070
You get a pass.

01:28.102 --> 01:29.003
You get a pass
'cause you grew up

01:29.037 --> 01:30.373
around mostly white people.

01:30.406 --> 01:31.106
Oh, well, I'm sorry
I didn't grow up

01:31.140 --> 01:33.843
eating lengua or barbacoa.

01:33.876 --> 01:34.977
Besides, look at you.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.879
You're eating rabbit
food in a wrap.

01:36.912 --> 01:37.847
Eh!

01:37.879 --> 01:38.813
I love meat.

01:38.846 --> 01:40.548
I love meat.

01:40.581 --> 01:42.150
It's just Maria wanted us
to try this vegan shit,

01:42.183 --> 01:43.819
so what am I supposed to do?

01:43.852 --> 01:44.853
I don't see Maria here.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.155
Yeah, but I'm gonna go home

01:46.188 --> 01:47.890
and she's gonna ask me
what I had for lunch,

01:47.923 --> 01:50.459
so what am I supposed to
do, lie to her every day?

01:50.492 --> 01:52.795
You tell Maria what you
had for lunch every day?

01:52.828 --> 01:54.864
Available units,
we have a domestic dispute

01:54.897 --> 01:56.865
in progress at 14
Independence Square.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.867
Repeat, domestic in progress.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.402
14 Independence Square.

02:00.436 --> 02:02.071
Shit, that's close.

02:05.641 --> 02:07.443
Unit 451 responding.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.943
We're two minutes out.

02:16.852 --> 02:18.954
Suspect
is armed and hostile.

02:18.986 --> 02:20.222
Turn right.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.056
Suspect believed
to be holding family hostage.

02:22.090 --> 02:23.793
All right,
go over here. Yeah.

02:23.825 --> 02:25.927
Number
of hostages, unknown.

02:25.961 --> 02:26.996
Left on Path.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.536
Okay,
kill the lights.

02:33.568 --> 02:35.103
Right here, right
here, right here, right here.

02:35.137 --> 02:37.539
Unit 451. We're on location.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.040
Unit 451,
set up a perimeter

02:39.074 --> 02:40.943
and standby for SWAT.

03:02.163 --> 03:03.064
No.

03:03.098 --> 03:04.634
No, no! Come on!

03:09.972 --> 03:11.907
Came from around back.

03:11.939 --> 03:13.908
This is Unit 451. We
got a hostile situation.

03:13.942 --> 03:15.243
What's your ETA on SWAT?

03:15.276 --> 03:18.146
SWAT
is five minutes out.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.615
Shit. Bishop.

03:26.622 --> 03:28.624
Get your ass up, now!

03:37.199 --> 03:38.968
Somebody's gonna get killed!

03:59.587 --> 04:00.889
Police! Get
on the fucking ground!

04:00.923 --> 04:01.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:02.824 --> 04:03.457
Fuck!

04:04.626 --> 04:06.829
This is Unit 451. Shots fired.

04:06.861 --> 04:08.597
Shots fired.

04:08.629 --> 04:09.698
Copy.

04:09.730 --> 04:10.566
Bishop!

04:15.736 --> 04:16.572
Bishop.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.146
Shit, shit, shit.

04:27.783 --> 04:28.617
Bishop.

04:29.785 --> 04:30.653
Don't
you fucking move!

04:30.685 --> 04:32.186
Let me see your hands!

04:32.220 --> 04:34.089
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

04:34.122 --> 04:35.157
Are you hit?

04:35.189 --> 04:36.791
He's bleeding out. Call it in.

04:36.824 --> 04:37.725
Are you hit?!

04:37.759 --> 04:39.595
I'm fine! Call it in!

04:39.627 --> 04:41.062
This is Unit 451. Shots fired.

04:41.096 --> 04:42.264
- Suspect down.
- Stop resisting!

04:42.297 --> 04:43.732
We
need an ambulance.

04:43.764 --> 04:44.666
- Repeat, shots fired.
- Give me your hand.

04:44.699 --> 04:45.867
- Turn around.
- Suspect down.

04:45.901 --> 04:48.037
Request for an
ambulance immediately.

04:51.038 --> 04:52.608
Swat: All right, let's go!

04:52.641 --> 04:54.810
- Let's go, in every closet!
- Check upstairs.

04:54.843 --> 04:56.110
Suspect down.

04:56.144 --> 04:58.146
- Get her outta there!
- Get the girl.

05:01.149 --> 05:02.584
You did good.

05:07.154 --> 05:10.158
I'm glad you and Wilkins
made it outta there safe.

05:14.196 --> 05:16.666
You may have saved that
girl's life tonight.

05:18.699 --> 05:21.771
Dispatch said the guy talked
about burning the house down.

05:25.307 --> 05:27.076
Are you all right?

05:27.108 --> 05:29.311
I know this was the first
time you've had to...

05:31.079 --> 05:32.915
I'm fine, Sergeant.

05:35.916 --> 05:37.318
It's okay.

05:37.351 --> 05:40.722
It's not supposed to be easy.

05:40.755 --> 05:42.123
Most officers are lucky,

05:42.156 --> 05:46.161
they go their whole careers
without firing a weapon.

05:46.194 --> 05:48.664
It's a difficult
thing to prepare for.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.834
It's part of the job.

05:56.071 --> 05:57.773
I'm here if you need me.

06:00.675 --> 06:03.077
Don't have to talk to
some stranger about it

06:03.110 --> 06:05.279
if you don't want to.

06:05.312 --> 06:06.714
Get some rest.

06:06.747 --> 06:08.750
Someone from HR
will call tomorrow

06:08.783 --> 06:10.719
and walk you through everything.

06:19.194 --> 06:21.129
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

06:21.163 --> 06:21.997
Okay.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.735
Why didn't you call me? Had
to hear it from Wilkins?

06:26.767 --> 06:28.302
Had to give my
statement to the FID,

06:28.336 --> 06:31.340
and then Sergeant
wanted to talk to me.

06:31.372 --> 06:32.875
I wasn't thinking.

06:34.276 --> 06:36.912
I got really scared
thinking about losing you.

06:38.980 --> 06:39.814
Can we, um

06:41.983 --> 06:44.786
Can you just come home?
Can you come home?

06:44.819 --> 06:45.654
I can't.

06:47.088 --> 06:49.425
Wilkins and I, we have some
paperwork to finish, so...

06:52.827 --> 06:55.997
That's fine. I
mean, come back home.

07:01.870 --> 07:02.704
Jan.

07:05.774 --> 07:07.276
I'll call you tonight.

07:13.348 --> 07:13.982
Okay.

07:17.252 --> 07:19.155
Really glad you're all right.

07:39.206 --> 07:41.076
I did not
see this one coming.

07:41.108 --> 07:42.110
Yeah, I should've
been there with you.

07:42.144 --> 07:43.778
You should've waited.

07:43.812 --> 07:45.280
Wasn't going in, I
was just trying to hear

07:45.312 --> 07:47.315
what he was saying
through the window.

07:47.348 --> 07:48.317
Then he kicked the door open,

07:48.350 --> 07:49.785
almost took my fucking face off-

07:49.817 --> 07:51.353
- You got lucky.

07:51.386 --> 07:54.256
You're gonna get yourself
killed pulling the hero shit.

07:55.357 --> 07:56.892
Fuck.

07:56.925 --> 07:58.093
Fucking wired.

08:03.899 --> 08:06.435
What makes a guy do
that to his own family?

08:11.372 --> 08:12.942
Gonna get another drink.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.310
I'm good.

08:15.343 --> 08:16.378
Yeah?

08:17.444 --> 08:19.113
Hey, hero.

08:19.146 --> 08:20.949
Celebrating your big day, huh?

08:22.317 --> 08:23.319
All right.

08:24.418 --> 08:25.253
What?

08:26.855 --> 08:28.324
Andre was my guy.

08:29.324 --> 08:32.427
Yeah. We played ball
at Central together.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.294
Good man.

08:34.495 --> 08:35.962
- Good family.
- Okay, it wasn't like that.

08:35.996 --> 08:37.298
It was self-defense.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.168
You even got the black
chick vouching for you.

08:40.201 --> 08:42.037
- That's cute.
- Okay, who the fuck are you?

08:42.070 --> 08:46.375
Hey, tell me something,
do you get like a prize

08:46.408 --> 08:48.342
for every brother you
kill or something,

08:48.375 --> 08:50.444
or like a cake,
or like stickers.

08:50.477 --> 08:52.346
How many niggas do
you have to kill-

08:52.379 --> 08:54.482
- You motherfucker!
- Get the fuck off me!

08:57.219 --> 08:58.854
Fuck you, man!

09:00.455 --> 09:01.355
- What?
- Fuck you!

09:01.389 --> 09:02.524
What? Hey, what's wrong?

09:02.557 --> 09:04.225
- What's wrong?
- You weren't there!

09:04.259 --> 09:05.527
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

09:05.559 --> 09:07.361
- We all on the same team.
- Hey, hey!

09:07.394 --> 09:08.930
He's an asshole, all
right? He wasn't there.

09:08.964 --> 09:10.165
He wasn't. He doesn't
know what happened.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.198
Fuck you!
You weren't there!

09:11.232 --> 09:12.466
- You weren't there!
- Hey, he wasn't, all right?

09:12.500 --> 09:13.467
Let it go.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.102
Come on.

09:15.135 --> 09:16.304
- Listen to your girl, huh?
- Chill the fuck out!

09:16.337 --> 09:17.905
Come on. Chill the fuck out.

09:17.938 --> 09:18.573
Bishop!

09:21.342 --> 09:22.343
Bye, hero.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.194
What a day.

09:41.129 --> 09:43.331
You've been here a week,
and you didn't tell me?

09:44.331 --> 09:45.835
Nice place, right?

09:48.937 --> 09:51.273
You can't keep
pulling this shit, man.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.443
Fuck it, give me one of those.

09:58.446 --> 10:00.282
Just...

10:00.315 --> 10:01.483
Gonna be good.

10:06.587 --> 10:08.289
What was it this time?

10:10.225 --> 10:11.125
It's always the same.

10:11.158 --> 10:13.461
You know, Jan doesn't get it.

10:13.495 --> 10:14.363
Get what?

10:15.462 --> 10:17.265
Us.

10:17.298 --> 10:18.132
Our job.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.336
The law, what we do.

10:22.336 --> 10:25.307
She just wants to find
the good in everyone.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.076
She wants to fix everyone.

10:30.577 --> 10:33.414
Well, you married
a social worker.

10:33.447 --> 10:34.449
What do you expect?

10:36.451 --> 10:38.320
Don't opposites attract?

10:39.553 --> 10:41.890
You're asking a lesbian
if opposites attract?

10:48.363 --> 10:49.431
- Yeah.
- Look, all I know

10:49.464 --> 10:51.099
is you gotta stop.

10:51.131 --> 10:52.400
You can't keep
pulling this shit.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.601
I mean, one of these days,
she's gonna smarten up

10:53.634 --> 10:54.702
and she's gonna leave your ass.

10:54.735 --> 10:56.337
Then what?

10:56.370 --> 10:57.405
Yeah, I know.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.410
You know? Then what
the fuck are you doing?

11:02.644 --> 11:06.447
I mean, you gotta fix
it, make it right.

12:47.081 --> 12:48.350
Hey!

12:48.383 --> 12:50.652
Knock it off before
we call the police!

12:53.321 --> 12:55.524
I am the fucking police!

13:31.525 --> 13:33.627
I'm sorry. Fuck.

13:33.660 --> 13:34.595
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:34.629 --> 13:36.532
Bishop. What are you doing here?

13:38.332 --> 13:39.533
I just wanted to
talk to Sergeant Ward.

13:39.567 --> 13:43.105
That's not a good idea, all
right? He's busy right now.

13:43.138 --> 13:44.339
Fine.

13:44.371 --> 13:46.274
I just wanna look
at my report again.

13:46.307 --> 13:49.443
You're fucking
wasted. Go home.

13:49.476 --> 13:50.578
Okay? Please.

13:52.679 --> 13:53.714
Why?

14:02.557 --> 14:04.759
Excuse me
for just a moment.

14:07.928 --> 14:10.231
Take them to my office.

14:10.264 --> 14:11.399
What's going on?

14:11.432 --> 14:12.366
What are you
doing here, Bishop?

14:12.399 --> 14:14.401
I thought I was clear yesterday.

14:14.434 --> 14:16.770
You need to take some time.

14:26.181 --> 14:26.815
Lucy.

14:29.350 --> 14:30.485
Lucy.

14:30.518 --> 14:31.887
Lucy, is that him?

14:34.721 --> 14:36.524
Is that him?

14:36.557 --> 14:38.426
Is that the man that
killed my husband?

14:38.458 --> 14:40.494
- Mrs. Hughes, listen to me.
- No, no.

14:40.528 --> 14:41.529
Is that him?

14:42.529 --> 14:44.632
- I wanna talk to him!
- Okay.

14:44.666 --> 14:45.467
- I wanna talk to you.
- No, no, no.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.768
- Go, you should go.
- Okay, listen-

14:46.801 --> 14:48.470
- You killed Andre!
- I know.

14:48.503 --> 14:50.172
- You killed my husband!
- Be careful, wait, wait.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.773
He's the one who killed Andre!

14:51.806 --> 14:53.307
I know,
I know, I know.

14:53.341 --> 14:54.709
I wanna talk to him!

14:54.741 --> 14:56.810
Why did you do
it?! I wanna know!

14:56.844 --> 14:59.848
Why did you come in my
house and kill my husband?!

14:59.880 --> 15:02.183
I wanna know! I wanna know!

15:02.216 --> 15:04.586
- Let's go in-
- ROSIE: I wanna know.

15:04.619 --> 15:05.420
Wait, come on now.

15:05.452 --> 15:07.254
Come on, let's go in.

15:07.288 --> 15:09.890
Now, listen, I've got a
family in mourning over there.

15:09.923 --> 15:11.893
I can't have you here
right, you understand?

15:11.926 --> 15:14.528
I've got to get back
and sort this all out.

15:14.562 --> 15:16.632
You go home and get some rest.

15:28.308 --> 15:29.610
- Are you defending him?
- No, ma'am.

15:29.644 --> 15:30.678
No.

15:31.613 --> 15:33.615
That man murdered my husband.

15:33.648 --> 15:35.350
Ma'am, ma'am, please.

15:35.383 --> 15:36.785
Don't touch me.

15:36.817 --> 15:38.452
If you would just
take your seat.

15:38.485 --> 15:39.987
Just take your seat,
we'll talk, we'll talk.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.355
Officer Wilkins,

15:41.389 --> 15:42.624
- you can step out.
- Hey, what do you know?

15:42.657 --> 15:43.425
Rosie,
wait. Wait, Rosie.

15:43.457 --> 15:44.658
Sis, what do you know?

15:44.692 --> 15:45.525
You have to tell
me what you know.

15:45.559 --> 15:47.761
Look, can you tell
me what you know?

15:47.794 --> 15:49.396
- Please?
- Let her go, come on now.

15:49.429 --> 15:51.232
Come on. Sit down.

15:51.265 --> 15:51.899
Sit down.

15:52.799 --> 15:54.668
Sit down, now.

15:54.701 --> 15:56.205
All right. All right.

16:01.442 --> 16:03.778
I'm terribly
sorry for your loss.

16:04.778 --> 16:06.280
We want to be completely

16:06.313 --> 16:07.848
- transparent.
- You don't get to be sorry.

16:09.417 --> 16:13.655
Tell me why your officers
were at my house.

16:16.624 --> 16:19.461
They were responding
to a hostage call

16:19.494 --> 16:20.963
from your residence.

16:22.596 --> 16:25.866
Now, the footage from
my officer's body camera

16:25.899 --> 16:30.437
showed your husband
with a broken bottle

16:30.471 --> 16:34.009
exiting the backdoor where
the altercation took place.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.410
Altercation?

16:36.410 --> 16:37.678
Altercation?

16:37.711 --> 16:40.881
You mean the one where
my husband was killed?

16:41.916 --> 16:43.685
I wanna hear it.

16:43.717 --> 16:44.685
I wanna hear that tape!

16:44.719 --> 16:46.354
That was not Andre!

16:46.386 --> 16:48.555
That's not what happened!

16:48.589 --> 16:49.758
You can ask my...

16:51.893 --> 16:52.927
You can ask my daughter.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.796
She was there the whole...

16:56.931 --> 16:59.301
She was there the whole time.

17:01.668 --> 17:03.804
This is
what we talked about.

17:04.872 --> 17:05.707
Okay?

17:09.810 --> 17:10.611
No.

17:10.644 --> 17:11.779
No, no! Come on!

17:12.913 --> 17:13.882
Get up, get up, get up.

17:13.914 --> 17:15.817
Come on. You got it, you got it.

17:15.848 --> 17:16.683
No.

17:16.718 --> 17:19.019
Fire this guy.

17:19.053 --> 17:20.555
Come on.

17:20.587 --> 17:21.954
Yeah, that's it. Come
on, let's get it.

17:21.989 --> 17:23.758
Let's get it, let's get it.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.726
Ah, shit. Come on.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.895
Language, Daddy.

17:27.929 --> 17:29.464
I'm sorry, baby.

17:30.397 --> 17:31.865
Hey, it's 8:30.

17:31.898 --> 17:33.634
Gonna get your schoolwork done?

17:33.667 --> 17:35.069
It's all done.

17:35.103 --> 17:37.672
Okay, well, go on
up and get it out

17:37.704 --> 17:39.607
so your mom can check
it in the morning, okay?

17:40.775 --> 17:42.744
And brush your teeth.

17:42.777 --> 17:43.812
It's almost time for bed.

17:46.646 --> 17:47.816
Hey.

17:47.848 --> 17:48.916
Don't play me now.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.089
Come on. Hustle.

17:56.857 --> 17:57.925
And he will be
the lead blocker for Hughes.

17:57.959 --> 17:58.893
He's got breakaway speed!

17:58.925 --> 17:59.894
Bye-bye.

18:02.028 --> 18:03.832
No, it's okay, baby.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.967
Daddy just got excited.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.369
I'll be up after I
throw this mess outside.

18:08.403 --> 18:09.703
Over eight points

18:09.737 --> 18:12.474
defensively here
in the four games

18:12.507 --> 18:14.875
that have led to this
six-eight championship.

18:16.510 --> 18:17.678
Oh, come on.

18:19.614 --> 18:21.016
Somebody's gonna get killed!

18:24.719 --> 18:25.987
This playbook is trash!

18:30.791 --> 18:32.093
What are you doing?!

18:41.501 --> 18:42.971
Get your ass up, now!

18:53.013 --> 18:53.814
Police,
get on the fucking-

19:09.497 --> 19:10.132
Dad?

19:18.972 --> 19:19.807
Dad?

19:37.657 --> 19:38.492
Dad?

19:49.202 --> 19:50.738
- Dad.
- Shots fired.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.105
Let me see
your fucking hands.

19:52.138 --> 19:54.675
Repeat, shots
fired. Suspect down.

19:54.709 --> 19:56.644
Request for an
ambulance immediately.

19:57.845 --> 19:58.913
Give me your
other fucking hand, now!

19:58.945 --> 20:00.147
Give it to me!

20:00.181 --> 20:02.250
Turn around. Give
me your other hand!

20:06.887 --> 20:08.155
- Let's go, in every closet!
- Check upstairs.

20:08.189 --> 20:09.891
- Suspect down.
- Get her outta there!

20:09.923 --> 20:11.460
Get the girl.

20:45.692 --> 20:46.494
Hey.

20:47.894 --> 20:48.962
How's it going?

20:48.996 --> 20:50.999
Fucking great.

20:51.031 --> 20:52.933
Right. Sorry.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.069
What's up?

20:58.806 --> 21:02.143
They brought in the girl to
give an official statement.

21:04.077 --> 21:06.647
They wanna open up
an investigation.

21:06.681 --> 21:09.150
Investigation? Into what?

21:09.182 --> 21:12.052
The wife says it
doesn't make sense.

21:12.086 --> 21:13.153
There were no hostages.

21:13.186 --> 21:15.055
She says she was at the
hospital visiting a friend.

21:15.088 --> 21:17.057
He was the perfect husband.

21:18.159 --> 21:20.328
What did the girl say?

21:20.361 --> 21:22.697
She said she was upstairs.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.033
You heard her
scream, though, right?

21:25.066 --> 21:27.201
Yeah. Yeah, I heard her.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.202
Okay, so why was he on
the porch with a bottle?

21:29.236 --> 21:30.972
I mean, can they explain that?

21:33.240 --> 21:36.076
He broke the bottle
watching the game.

21:37.944 --> 21:38.846
Look, I got one of the guys

21:38.880 --> 21:41.082
to send over a copy
of the Hughes call,

21:41.115 --> 21:42.916
but you gotta delete it
after you listen to it.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.219
I don't think the
family's heard it yet.

21:45.251 --> 21:46.620
Did you listen to it?

21:46.653 --> 21:48.021
Yeah.

21:48.055 --> 21:50.158
It's messed up.

21:50.191 --> 21:53.027
So you just gotta be careful
'cause it can't leak out.

21:53.059 --> 21:54.061
Of course.

21:54.095 --> 21:55.896
I just wanna know what happened.

21:58.031 --> 22:00.000
Okay. I'm sending it now.

22:00.034 --> 22:01.803
Thanks
for this, all right?

22:17.652 --> 22:19.019
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

22:19.053 --> 22:21.089
Shit. Shit.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.657
Just try
to remain calm, sir.

22:22.690 --> 22:23.391
What is your emergency?

22:23.423 --> 22:24.858
I...

22:26.093 --> 22:28.930
Start by giving
me your name and your address.

22:28.962 --> 22:30.330
Don't
tell me what to do.

22:30.364 --> 22:33.134
Don't you ever tell me
what do, you understand?

22:33.166 --> 22:35.669
Sir,
yes, I understand.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.137
But how can I help you?

22:37.171 --> 22:39.106
I won't
let her take my kids.

22:40.207 --> 22:41.909
She can't take them.

22:41.942 --> 22:42.876
They're mine.

22:43.877 --> 22:45.846
Sir, I need
to know where you are

22:45.880 --> 22:48.416
so that I can send help.

22:48.449 --> 22:51.219
14
Independence Square.

22:51.251 --> 22:53.253
I'll shoot her if she leaves.

22:53.287 --> 22:55.355
You have to stop her.

22:55.388 --> 22:58.825
If she tries to take my
kids, I'll fucking kill her.

22:58.858 --> 23:00.827
Where are you now?

23:00.861 --> 23:02.096
In the kitchen.

23:02.128 --> 23:04.197
Okay.
And where is she?

23:04.230 --> 23:05.799
In the closet.

23:08.368 --> 23:10.003
Are you sending someone?

23:10.037 --> 23:11.405
Yes, officers
have been dispatched.

23:11.439 --> 23:13.374
Now, I'm gonna-

23:35.962 --> 23:37.764
Police are
expected to make a statement

23:37.798 --> 23:39.333
tomorrow on the incident
that took the life

23:39.365 --> 23:42.936
of local football
coach Andre Hughes.

23:42.970 --> 23:45.038
Police received a distressed
call that brought them

23:45.071 --> 23:47.274
to the Hughes residence
just after 9:00 p.m.,

23:47.307 --> 23:49.109
when an altercation began,

23:49.143 --> 23:52.346
resulting in the death of the
well-respected football coach.

23:53.748 --> 23:56.084
He is survived by
his wife Rosie Hughes

23:56.116 --> 23:57.085
and their daughter Lucy,

23:57.117 --> 24:00.154
as well as his parents
Gayle and Albert Hughes.

24:02.123 --> 24:04.225
When we return, we'll
go to Alison Wade

24:04.258 --> 24:06.795
who was with the Hughes
family earlier today.

24:17.270 --> 24:20.441
I've covered a lot of
stories on the school

24:20.473 --> 24:24.178
and... Andre over the years.

24:25.512 --> 24:27.281
He was such a kind man.

24:29.784 --> 24:31.486
So sorry for your loss.

24:33.854 --> 24:34.489
Okay.

24:40.094 --> 24:41.195
Ready?

24:41.228 --> 24:42.063
Yeah.

24:43.963 --> 24:45.332
Whenever you're ready.

24:50.104 --> 24:51.338
Andre Hughes

24:55.276 --> 24:59.346
was a loving husband and father.

25:00.980 --> 25:03.284
He was the light of our family

25:04.951 --> 25:08.256
and he was a part of this
community his entire life.

25:10.290 --> 25:11.759
I want answers.

25:13.259 --> 25:16.196
We all lost a great
man last night,

25:17.463 --> 25:19.267
and I wanna know why.

25:20.968 --> 25:22.504
Andre loved everyone,

25:24.939 --> 25:26.775
and everyone loved him.

25:28.608 --> 25:33.781
Why was my husband murdered
by the police in his own home?

25:37.317 --> 25:38.252
Is that him?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.355
Lucy, is that him?

25:42.623 --> 25:44.991
Is that the man that
killed my husband?

25:45.025 --> 25:46.994
- Mrs. Hughes, listen to me.
- No, no.

25:47.027 --> 25:47.961
Is that him?

26:35.643 --> 26:38.278
Hey, it's Wilkins.

26:38.311 --> 26:40.247
You gotta come in.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.983
Sergeant Ward needs
to talk to you.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.285
It's urgent.

26:55.561 --> 26:57.230
We want justice!

26:57.263 --> 26:58.498
We want justice!

26:58.531 --> 27:00.134
We want justice!

27:00.166 --> 27:01.301
We want justice!

27:01.335 --> 27:03.337
We want justice!

27:04.471 --> 27:06.007
We want justice!

27:07.441 --> 27:08.977
We want justice!

27:10.477 --> 27:12.013
We want justice!

27:13.480 --> 27:15.115
Did you
see everyone outside?

27:15.148 --> 27:16.950
Yeah, there have
been suits here all day.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.451
Fuck.

27:18.484 --> 27:20.288
Look, I know Sergeant
Ward wants to talk to you,

27:20.320 --> 27:23.924
but they're not telling
me what's going on.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.961
They think I shot him
because he was black.

27:29.395 --> 27:31.298
I shot him because
I felt threatened,

27:31.332 --> 27:33.334
because I was doing
my fucking job.

27:36.470 --> 27:37.637
Yeah, I know.

27:37.671 --> 27:42.977
But listen, man, they're tired
of being seen as a threat.

27:44.411 --> 27:46.514
I mean, they wanna know
were you threatened by him

27:47.548 --> 27:49.182
or what he looks like.

27:51.518 --> 27:53.020
You get that, right?

27:54.020 --> 27:55.522
Are you saying I'm a racist?

27:55.556 --> 27:56.356
Did I say that?

27:56.390 --> 27:57.992
- Did I say that?
- No, what the fuck

27:58.025 --> 27:59.093
are you saying, then, Wilkins-

27:59.125 --> 28:00.327
Good morning.

28:00.361 --> 28:02.530
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Sarge.

28:02.563 --> 28:05.967
Officer Wilkins, could we
speak with Bishop alone, please?

28:06.000 --> 28:06.934
Yes, sir.

28:09.569 --> 28:12.605
This is Mr. Smith. He's
the department lawyer.

28:12.638 --> 28:13.974
- Morning.
- Will.

28:14.008 --> 28:14.607
Morning.

28:14.641 --> 28:16.110
Okay. Please.

28:23.017 --> 28:24.485
Bishop, are you all right?

28:25.551 --> 28:27.387
I didn't expect any of this.

28:28.521 --> 28:30.390
You responded to

28:30.423 --> 28:33.527
a distress call about
a violent situation

28:33.559 --> 28:35.495
and you acted with bravery.

28:37.698 --> 28:41.769
Not many people realize the
burdens we volunteer for

28:41.801 --> 28:45.205
when we take on
this job every day.

28:45.239 --> 28:49.344
It's a heroic responsibility
just to put on a badge.

28:50.477 --> 28:55.483
Now, we received some disturbing
information this morning

28:56.717 --> 29:00.321
and we're still
investigating its legitimacy.

29:00.354 --> 29:02.155
But I wanted to
sit down with you,

29:02.189 --> 29:03.758
give you the news first,

29:03.790 --> 29:07.461
so that I can answer any
questions you may have.

29:09.496 --> 29:11.332
An email came in.

29:11.365 --> 29:16.170
It contained a recording of
some people playing video games

29:16.202 --> 29:18.605
the night of the Hughes call.

29:18.638 --> 29:20.040
Went on for hours.

29:20.074 --> 29:22.343
There are pages and
pages of arguments

29:22.375 --> 29:24.112
in the transcriptions here.

29:25.546 --> 29:28.215
At first, it made no sense,

29:28.248 --> 29:31.585
but then one of the players

29:31.617 --> 29:34.588
threatened to send a SWAT
team to someone's house.

29:36.256 --> 29:39.593
That address was 14
Independence Square.

29:44.765 --> 29:46.667
I just don't understand

29:46.700 --> 29:49.836
- how assholes these days-
- You know,

29:49.869 --> 29:52.305
I know this is a lot to take in,

29:52.338 --> 29:53.540
but what's important to remember

29:53.574 --> 29:55.643
are the facts of the situation.

29:58.644 --> 30:00.346
Take a look at that.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.215
Now,

30:03.750 --> 30:07.387
from the footage,
from your body cam,

30:07.421 --> 30:09.355
Andre Hughes was
angry that night

30:09.388 --> 30:11.758
when he came through
the door at you.

30:11.791 --> 30:15.161
You and Officer
Wilkins both reported

30:15.194 --> 30:17.564
hearing the shattering
of glass inside the house

30:17.597 --> 30:19.866
and a girl's scream.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.869
As you secured a perimeter,

30:21.902 --> 30:24.672
you encountered the
suspect at the door

30:24.704 --> 30:27.807
holding a broken
bottle in his hand.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.644
You announced yourself
as a police officer

30:30.676 --> 30:34.115
and instructed him to get
on the ground, correct?

30:36.583 --> 30:37.485
Mr. Bishop?

30:38.551 --> 30:39.352
Yes.

30:40.686 --> 30:42.789
He
disobeyed those orders

30:42.823 --> 30:45.192
and threw the bottle at you,

30:45.224 --> 30:48.495
causing you to fire
at the suspect.

30:48.528 --> 30:49.564
Is that correct?

30:50.931 --> 30:52.165
Officer Bishop?

30:53.634 --> 30:55.169
Officer Bishop,
these are the facts

30:55.201 --> 30:57.505
that we must be very clear
about before your hearing,

30:57.538 --> 30:58.673
do you understand?

31:01.407 --> 31:03.144
Jesus Christ.

31:05.479 --> 31:06.680
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

31:06.712 --> 31:08.148
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

31:08.182 --> 31:09.549
It's okay.

31:09.583 --> 31:13.187
It's okay. Let me go get
something to clean this up.

31:13.220 --> 31:14.387
It's all right.

31:14.421 --> 31:15.823
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

32:18.852 --> 32:20.621
Oh. Excuse me, Sergeant, sir.

32:20.653 --> 32:22.556
Can you tell me what's going on?

32:22.588 --> 32:24.692
Like, what's the
suit doing here?

32:24.724 --> 32:26.659
We got an email.

32:26.692 --> 32:28.295
The call was faked.

32:28.327 --> 32:29.797
Some assholes online.

32:31.798 --> 32:34.701
Jesus Christ. We got swatted?

32:34.734 --> 32:36.269
What did Bishop say?

32:36.303 --> 32:37.504
Nothing yet.

32:37.537 --> 32:38.972
He got sick.

32:39.006 --> 32:40.841
Oh, my god, how is
this even possible?

32:40.874 --> 32:42.343
How does this happen?

32:43.410 --> 32:44.278
I don't know.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.645
People are fucked.

32:50.916 --> 32:51.718
Shit!

32:53.053 --> 32:54.955
I'll go check the parking lot.

32:54.988 --> 32:56.824
God dammit, Bishop.

32:56.856 --> 32:59.726
This is a big liability
for the department, Sergeant.

32:59.759 --> 33:01.628
Those news stations are
growing out there too.

33:01.662 --> 33:03.663
This guy was a local legend.

33:03.696 --> 33:06.599
You need to make Bishop understand
he acted in self-defense.

33:06.633 --> 33:07.534
Get him in line.

33:07.567 --> 33:09.002
This can't look like blindfire.

33:09.036 --> 33:11.639
If not for him, for the
rest of the department.

33:11.672 --> 33:12.873
He needs to be at
that hearing next week

33:12.905 --> 33:14.741
and he needs to
have it together.

33:19.945 --> 33:21.714
He's gone, sir.

33:21.748 --> 33:22.816
They said he
grabbed a few things

33:22.848 --> 33:24.817
from his desk and took off.

33:24.851 --> 33:25.853
Did he talk to anyone?

33:25.885 --> 33:26.819
No, sir.

33:26.853 --> 33:29.456
Oh, God dammit, Bishop.

33:29.489 --> 33:32.492
If he's AWOL, I can't
do anything to help him.

33:32.526 --> 33:33.760
Well, I'll go find him.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.461
No, no, no, no,
no, no. Stay here.

33:35.494 --> 33:36.663
We need you here.

33:36.696 --> 33:38.331
Have you seen that
crowd outside?

33:38.365 --> 33:39.599
It's getting bigger.

33:40.933 --> 33:42.002
I understand.

33:45.372 --> 33:46.307
Dammit.

33:48.875 --> 33:51.444
Come on, Bishop.

34:07.827 --> 34:08.728
Hi, you've reached

34:08.762 --> 34:09.964
- Will Bishop.
- Shit.

34:14.634 --> 34:15.835
Hi, you've
reached Will Bishop.

34:15.869 --> 34:16.702
Son of a bitch.

34:16.737 --> 34:18.371
I can't
get to the phone,

34:18.405 --> 34:19.840
so leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.507
Thanks.

34:21.541 --> 34:22.842
Bishop, it's me.

34:24.577 --> 34:25.878
Come on, man, you
gotta talk to me.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.714
You gotta talk to me, okay?

34:29.416 --> 34:31.851
I know what kinda cop you are.

34:32.918 --> 34:33.853
I know you.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.693
We can work this out together,
but you gotta call me.

34:52.838 --> 34:54.541
- Hi.
- Hey, it's Wilkins.

34:54.574 --> 34:55.876
What's going on?

34:55.909 --> 34:57.845
I need your help.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.847
Yeah, there's people gathering

34:59.880 --> 35:01.081
outside of our house with signs.

35:01.114 --> 35:03.916
They have been
for the last hour.

35:03.949 --> 35:05.418
I've called Will,
he's not answering.

35:05.452 --> 35:06.420
What's going on?

35:06.452 --> 35:07.688
I can't get ahold of Will.

35:07.721 --> 35:08.956
He just left the station and-

35:08.989 --> 35:10.757
- We want justice!
- Jan?

35:10.791 --> 35:12.059
- We want justice!
- Jan?

36:08.047 --> 36:09.048
ChayMoney.

37:30.829 --> 37:31.998
As tensions
rise in the community,

37:32.030 --> 37:35.701
we go live to Alison Wade who
is at the police precinct.

37:35.735 --> 37:37.704
- Alison?
- Want justice!

37:37.737 --> 37:39.139
We want justice!

37:39.172 --> 37:40.907
We want justice!

37:40.940 --> 37:43.009
- We want justice!
- The protest remains peaceful

37:43.043 --> 37:46.113
as the numbers continue to grow
outside the police station.

37:46.146 --> 37:48.815
Students have been arriving
wearing football jerseys

37:48.847 --> 37:51.985
and the schools colors
in support of the coach.

37:56.222 --> 37:57.891
Yo, flank left.

37:57.923 --> 37:58.692
I don't know if I
have it. They're right there.

37:58.724 --> 37:59.927
They're right there.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.860
Yo, I'm
coming. I'm coming.

38:00.893 --> 38:02.094
You get the drop.

38:02.128 --> 38:03.329
Where's
the other team?

38:03.362 --> 38:04.897
Look at tunnels. Take
the stairs, take the stairs.

38:04.931 --> 38:07.034
What are
you doing? Come on.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.568
Ah, shit.

38:08.601 --> 38:09.836
God dammit.

38:11.003 --> 38:12.204
Yo, this guy sucks.

38:12.237 --> 38:13.973
Hello? Hello?

38:14.007 --> 38:15.041
Hello.

38:16.009 --> 38:17.144
Can you hear me?

38:18.110 --> 38:20.580
- Hello?
- Yo, who is this guy?

38:20.614 --> 38:23.050
I'm looking for
ChayMoney. You know him?

38:23.083 --> 38:23.951
Piss off.

38:25.251 --> 38:29.356
I'm looking for
ChayMoney or the Grinch.

38:29.389 --> 38:30.958
You know where they are?

38:30.990 --> 38:33.193
Yo, quit the
game, you fucking noob.

38:33.226 --> 38:36.096
Hey, can you just
tell me where they are?

38:36.128 --> 38:38.998
Are you joking? This
is the internet, you pleb.

38:39.032 --> 38:41.367
Hey, man, I'm in the
middle of a game with them,

38:41.400 --> 38:43.169
so can you just tell
me where to find them?

38:43.202 --> 38:44.971
Oh, my
god, this guy sucks.

38:45.005 --> 38:47.007
Hey, grandpa, go
back to the main menu

38:47.039 --> 38:48.608
and add them to
your friends list.

38:52.177 --> 38:54.313
Thanks. Thanks, man.

39:23.208 --> 39:24.243
Fuck.

39:54.139 --> 39:55.842
Wolverine Nation!

39:55.875 --> 39:58.411
I wanna thank everyone for
your support this season.

39:58.445 --> 40:01.014
Coaching football has
always been a dream of mine

40:01.047 --> 40:02.081
and that's a dream
that comes with both

40:02.114 --> 40:04.350
the wins and the losses.

40:04.384 --> 40:05.751
Now, we may have
come up short today,

40:05.784 --> 40:07.253
but I want you to
know this is a season

40:07.286 --> 40:10.056
I will never forget, okay?

40:10.090 --> 40:11.792
I can only hope
that when the pain

40:11.824 --> 40:13.393
of tonight's game wears off,

40:13.425 --> 40:14.827
that each and every one of you

40:14.860 --> 40:17.163
has as many fond
memories as I do.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.932
I want every one of these
young men to understand

40:19.965 --> 40:22.768
the impact they've had on
me, on their teammates,

40:22.802 --> 40:24.037
the impact on the other students

40:24.070 --> 40:25.338
and the whole
community around them,

40:25.371 --> 40:27.106
and on the memories
that you created

40:27.139 --> 40:29.710
that we will cherish
for a lifetime.

40:29.742 --> 40:31.344
Hey, cupcake.

40:31.376 --> 40:32.211
Come here.

40:33.246 --> 40:35.248
You wanna say something?

40:35.280 --> 40:38.085
- Go Wolverines!
- Go Wolverines!

41:35.974 --> 41:38.010
Hey, it's me.

41:38.043 --> 41:39.980
Wilkins told me
where to find you.

41:43.416 --> 41:44.785
Come on.

41:44.818 --> 41:45.552
Let me in.

41:45.585 --> 41:47.019
Your car's in the parking lot

41:47.052 --> 41:49.021
and I can smell the
cigarettes from here.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.496
I'll stay out here all
night if I have to.

42:00.199 --> 42:01.400
What are you doing here?

42:03.036 --> 42:04.838
I love you
and I wanna help.

42:06.338 --> 42:08.275
You can't fix this one, Jan.

42:12.277 --> 42:13.279
Please let me in.

42:19.318 --> 42:20.153
I can't.

42:24.923 --> 42:25.559
Okay.

42:29.094 --> 42:31.130
Okay, then we can
talk like this.

42:44.077 --> 42:47.347
Do you remember when we
first started dating,

42:47.380 --> 42:49.883
and we'd just would,
like, drive circles

42:49.916 --> 42:51.585
around the city
with nowhere to be?

42:55.454 --> 42:58.357
You know, those were some
of my favorite nights.

42:58.391 --> 43:00.126
Yeah, you know, stick it to him.

43:01.527 --> 43:04.431
Makes me feel better about
sleeping my comfortable bed.

43:04.463 --> 43:05.865
Where are we going?

43:05.898 --> 43:08.434
I told you. Just trust me.

43:08.467 --> 43:10.403
This guy is the best.

43:12.271 --> 43:14.974
You always had some
local hero or urban legend

43:15.007 --> 43:16.876
you couldn't wait to show me.

43:20.579 --> 43:22.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:22.248 --> 43:24.384
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

43:24.416 --> 43:26.119
Officer Bishop.

43:26.152 --> 43:28.889
This is Jan,
this is my friend Jan.

43:28.922 --> 43:31.391
What did I do to
deserve you two tonight, huh?

43:33.059 --> 43:35.428
It was like the world
wasn't a dark place anymore

43:35.460 --> 43:36.395
'cause you had this light

43:36.429 --> 43:39.066
that made everybody
else around you shine.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.302
- He's a musician hot dog man.
- Why'd you come here?

43:42.335 --> 43:44.438
- Yeah.
- For a dog and a song.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.375
And that's the man
I fell in love with.

43:53.211 --> 43:57.317
♪ Hot dogs and whiskey
makes me feel frisky ♪

43:57.349 --> 44:00.987
♪ Holding her hand
on a Saturday night ♪

44:01.019 --> 44:05.190
♪ Said hot dogs and whiskey,
maybe she'll kiss me ♪

44:05.224 --> 44:08.961
♪ Looking into her eyes
in the cold moonlight ♪

44:13.365 --> 44:15.969
That's the man I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

44:18.704 --> 44:20.373
And I know you're still there.

44:25.244 --> 44:27.079
We used to stay up
all night laughing

44:27.112 --> 44:30.149
at each other's stories,
and now, we barely speak.

44:32.217 --> 44:33.585
I wanna find a way to start over

44:33.619 --> 44:36.389
and remember the
people we used to be.

44:38.157 --> 44:39.425
You never told me
your pet peeve.

44:40.559 --> 44:41.228
Oh, yeah, I don't have any.

44:41.260 --> 44:42.494
Come on, you must have one.

44:42.527 --> 44:43.629
No, I'll do it in a second.

44:48.701 --> 44:49.536
Will.

44:50.635 --> 44:52.940
Hey, hey, hey. It's a car.

44:54.306 --> 44:55.241
It's a car.

44:59.244 --> 45:01.047
I hate what this
job has done to you.

45:05.385 --> 45:07.520
Jan, I can't
drag you into this.

45:07.552 --> 45:09.556
You're not dragging me into
anything I'm not already in.

45:09.588 --> 45:10.990
I'm your wife.

45:11.023 --> 45:13.492
There's people screaming
outside of our house.

45:13.525 --> 45:15.494
Tell me what's going on.

45:22.300 --> 45:24.336
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I don't understand.

45:24.369 --> 45:27.007
I've been married to you for
five years, I don't understand.

45:27.039 --> 45:28.474
What do you want me to say?

45:28.507 --> 45:31.110
Don't you get it? I
don't want you here!

45:31.143 --> 45:32.644
You can't fix this!

45:32.677 --> 45:34.413
Just leave me alone.

45:38.351 --> 45:39.419
I love you, Will,
and you have to pull

45:39.452 --> 45:41.188
yourself outta this.

45:42.387 --> 45:44.556
If you won't talk to
me, talk to Wilkins.

45:55.501 --> 45:56.670
I love you too.

46:22.260 --> 46:23.096
Hello?

46:27.532 --> 46:28.601
Okay.

46:28.634 --> 46:30.436
Okay, okay, calm down.

46:31.570 --> 46:32.639
What did he say?

46:36.576 --> 46:38.244
No, no, no. He loves you.

46:38.277 --> 46:40.346
He's probably still drunk.

46:40.378 --> 46:42.248
Just try and let
him sleep it off.

46:44.349 --> 46:46.052
Yeah, we'll go together
in the morning.

46:47.652 --> 46:48.286
Okay?

46:51.224 --> 46:53.326
I'll call you in the morning.

46:53.358 --> 46:55.061
Try to get some rest.

47:11.610 --> 47:12.679
Is Jan all right?

47:14.579 --> 47:15.514
She's a mess.

47:18.550 --> 47:21.621
I mean, you know, the
protestors were outside

47:21.653 --> 47:23.657
her house all day, and then...

47:25.224 --> 47:28.161
This swatting thing has really
got Bishop pretty fucked up.

47:30.695 --> 47:31.797
What are you gonna do?

47:34.833 --> 47:35.868
I don't know.

47:39.405 --> 47:41.575
People want me choose sides.

47:45.677 --> 47:46.512
I can't.

47:54.253 --> 47:56.189
Come on, babe, let's
try to get some rest.

47:57.657 --> 47:58.692
Come on.

51:05.777 --> 51:06.913
Come on, Bishop.

51:08.947 --> 51:10.849
They're
up in the tower.

51:10.882 --> 51:11.917
Someone's gotta get
them outta there.

51:11.951 --> 51:13.385
We gotta get around.

51:15.153 --> 51:16.922
I hear voices inside.

51:16.956 --> 51:18.490
I'll try calling him again.

51:24.563 --> 51:26.800
Hey, it's Wilkins.
We're just here to help.

51:30.735 --> 51:32.404
He's not answering.

51:32.438 --> 51:34.574
He's probably passed
out, honestly.

51:45.885 --> 51:46.819
Listen up, everyone.

51:46.851 --> 51:47.920
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,

51:47.952 --> 51:50.655
but the store will temporarily
close at this time.

51:50.688 --> 51:52.958
I'm here on an official
police investigation,

51:52.992 --> 51:54.427
so you come back in an hour.

51:56.661 --> 51:58.697
Sorry for the inconvenience.

51:58.731 --> 51:59.532
Thank you.

52:05.471 --> 52:07.539
I shouldn't have
left him last night.

52:21.052 --> 52:22.821
A suspect is still at large.

52:22.855 --> 52:26.025
We know his phone number
originates from this carrier,

52:26.057 --> 52:27.726
but I need his address.

52:28.927 --> 52:29.895
Now, I spoke to your supervisor

52:29.929 --> 52:32.030
and he said you can get
it for me no problem.

52:33.666 --> 52:34.534
I should call someone first.

52:34.567 --> 52:35.735
I've never done

52:35.768 --> 52:36.702
- anything like this.
- This is an emergency.

52:36.735 --> 52:37.670
One man is already dead.

52:37.702 --> 52:40.773
We don't have time, do
you understand that?

52:40.806 --> 52:43.074
Yeah, just give me a sec.

52:48.614 --> 52:50.983
Okay, the name on the
account is Beverly Miller.

53:04.163 --> 53:05.164
Thank you.

53:16.976 --> 53:18.445
What's it say?

53:21.614 --> 53:22.882
I wish I
could bring back the man

53:22.914 --> 53:24.750
you fell in love with.

53:26.684 --> 53:28.788
When I look in the
mirror some days,

53:29.788 --> 53:31.858
I see the same stranger as you.

53:35.894 --> 53:38.931
I'm sorry for everything I said,
I didn't mean a word of it.

53:42.635 --> 53:44.170
I wasn't strong enough
to open the door,

53:44.202 --> 53:46.139
and I'm sorry for that.

53:51.643 --> 53:53.044
Remember us smiling.

54:14.800 --> 54:15.768
Ah, shit.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.202
It needs a password.

54:25.643 --> 54:27.546
Have you seen him
like this before?

54:30.114 --> 54:31.750
Drunk, yes.

54:31.784 --> 54:32.585
But not like this.

54:36.355 --> 54:38.224
Okay, you're in.

54:54.239 --> 54:56.108
Oh, he's looking
for the gamer.

54:57.041 --> 54:58.310
I gotta call this in.

54:58.344 --> 54:59.778
Shit.

54:59.811 --> 55:02.080
I'm just gonna
need an address.

55:02.114 --> 55:04.916
I can find him.
I can find him.

56:44.083 --> 56:45.184
Police Department!

56:49.987 --> 56:52.023
Good morning. I'm
Officer Bishop.

56:52.056 --> 56:53.259
Hope I didn't wake you.

56:55.260 --> 56:56.929
No, no. It's okay.

56:58.163 --> 57:00.132
I'm here investigating
a homicide.

57:02.768 --> 57:04.269
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

57:06.137 --> 57:07.005
Chase Miller.

57:10.141 --> 57:11.277
All right, Chase.

57:11.309 --> 57:14.313
Do you know anyone who goes
by the name of ChayMoney?

57:17.750 --> 57:18.384
No.

57:21.286 --> 57:23.155
I don't.

57:23.188 --> 57:24.222
Sorry.

57:27.826 --> 57:29.028
What are you doing?! Stop!

57:29.061 --> 57:30.296
You
know what you did!

57:30.329 --> 57:31.731
- It was just a prank call.
- A prank?!

57:31.764 --> 57:32.832
A fucking prank?!

57:32.864 --> 57:33.765
I'm sorry!

57:33.798 --> 57:35.266
Do you know what you did?

57:35.300 --> 57:37.103
Do you have any fucking idea
how many lives you ruined

57:37.135 --> 57:38.771
that night with your
fucking prank call?!

57:38.804 --> 57:40.005
Available units,

57:40.038 --> 57:41.507
we have a domestic
dispute in progress.

57:41.539 --> 57:43.242
Do you know what you did?!

57:43.275 --> 57:44.210
Do you have any fucking idea?!

57:44.242 --> 57:46.211
Suspect
is armed and hostile.

57:48.179 --> 57:51.015
People are dead
because of you!

57:51.048 --> 57:53.184
We were the first
ones on the scene.

57:53.217 --> 57:54.920
Somebody's
gonna get killed!

57:56.121 --> 57:56.889
How were
we supposed to know

57:56.922 --> 57:57.856
the call was fake, huh?

57:57.889 --> 57:59.157
What's your ETA on SWAT?

57:59.190 --> 58:01.493
SWAT is five minutes out.

58:03.461 --> 58:05.230
Say something!

58:05.264 --> 58:08.201
Please, it was an
accident. I didn't mean to.

58:09.400 --> 58:10.235
I'm sorry!

58:22.547 --> 58:24.349
No, no. No, no, no.

58:25.416 --> 58:26.818
It was just a...

58:31.422 --> 58:32.858
Listen. Listen!

58:35.293 --> 58:38.029
I didn't know that
was gonna happen.

58:38.063 --> 58:39.432
I didn't mean for
any of it to happen!

58:41.365 --> 58:42.201
I'm sorry.

58:42.233 --> 58:43.402
Shut the fuck up.

58:51.043 --> 58:53.045
His name was Andre Hughes.

58:55.914 --> 58:56.549
Look at him.

58:58.115 --> 58:59.217
Look at him!

58:59.251 --> 59:00.253
He's dead!

59:03.155 --> 59:07.426
He was a husband,
father, teacher, coach.

59:09.027 --> 59:09.862
He's gone.

59:12.530 --> 59:14.465
You said it was a
hostage situation.

59:14.498 --> 59:16.101
You said he was armed.

59:19.905 --> 59:22.074
I heard him yelling
from the street.

59:22.106 --> 59:23.474
Let's go! Come on!

59:23.507 --> 59:26.244
I thought he was holding
his family hostage.

59:26.277 --> 59:28.313
That's what you said!

59:28.347 --> 59:31.250
What the fuck was I
supposed to think?

59:31.282 --> 59:33.018
Why would you do this?

59:33.050 --> 59:34.052
Tell me why!

59:41.360 --> 59:42.195
Why?!

59:43.561 --> 59:45.463
I'm sorry, it was a...

59:47.498 --> 59:49.300
It was the wrong house.

59:49.333 --> 59:51.903
It was supposed to
be this guy online.

59:53.304 --> 59:54.573
People do it all the time.

59:56.307 --> 59:58.309
We were just playing games.

59:58.342 --> 01:00:00.378
Do you know what you did?

01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:02.347
Do you have any fucking idea?!

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.583
Yeah, keep talking shit.

01:00:04.615 --> 01:00:07.619
Kill all of you,
except you, Grinch.

01:00:08.686 --> 01:00:10.255
I'll make you my bitch.

01:00:11.356 --> 01:00:12.625
You don't know me.

01:00:12.657 --> 01:00:14.092
I'll show up with my AR.

01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:15.661
Oh, fuck!

01:00:15.693 --> 01:00:18.063
That's right.
Suck a dick, motherfucker.

01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:20.633
Hey, Justin Bieber,
where you at, man?

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.001
Come on, bring it.

01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:23.135
This dude thinks he's hard.

01:00:23.168 --> 01:00:24.903
Keep talking shit, man.

01:00:24.936 --> 01:00:26.471
You guys suck.

01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:28.173
If teams were even,
we would fuck you up.

01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:29.974
Fuck me up, you
haven't fucked anything.

01:00:30.007 --> 01:00:31.175
Beat your ass, bro.

01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:32.143
Beat my ass,
only thing you beat

01:00:32.177 --> 01:00:33.312
is your own dick, virgin.

01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:36.448
You gonna let him talk
to you like that, man?

01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:38.017
Tell him what's up.

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.285
Where you from?

01:00:39.318 --> 01:00:41.487
I'm from L.A., but
stay at your mom's otherwise.

01:00:41.519 --> 01:00:43.456
I'll come fuck you
up with these hands.

01:00:44.422 --> 01:00:46.424
Where do you live?

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.559
I'll send some of my
squad to come fuck you up.

01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:49.961
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:51.195
Squad
with the Mousketeers?

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:52.397
I've killed before
in Afghanistan.

01:00:54.099 --> 01:00:55.367
You've killed before?

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.434
What, did you go on a
fucking high school trip?

01:00:56.467 --> 01:00:57.435
Suck a dick.

01:00:58.336 --> 01:00:59.972
Bunch of fags in L.A.

01:01:01.373 --> 01:01:03.108
Talk that shit in Arizona,
you'll get fucked up.

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:06.512
I'll drive down, put one in you
tonight if you keep talking.

01:01:06.545 --> 01:01:08.347
14 Independent
Square, bitch.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.483
Oh, damn. This guy fucking
challenged you, dude.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.953
You should SWAT him.

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:17.155
Fuck this cock, dude.

01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:18.523
He doesn't even
think you'll do it.

01:01:30.268 --> 01:01:32.670
Think this muppet gave
me his real address.

01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:35.608
What an idiot.

01:01:39.443 --> 01:01:41.512
Yo, do you still have
that shitty prepay phone?

01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:43.114
- Yeah.
- Oh, perfect, dude.

01:01:43.148 --> 01:01:44.383
Use that.

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:45.584
Yeah, just gimme a second.

01:01:45.617 --> 01:01:47.419
I gotta find the
police number for L.A.

01:01:47.452 --> 01:01:48.254
All right.

01:01:50.188 --> 01:01:51.356
What a fucking dumb ass.

01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:54.759
You know, dude, we
should record his stream

01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:56.260
so we can upload it.

01:01:56.293 --> 01:01:57.528
Oh, shit.

01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.230
Fucking hilarious,
man. Can you imagine?

01:02:03.568 --> 01:02:05.336
Okay, shut up,
dude. I'm dialing.

01:02:05.369 --> 01:02:06.605
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:11.108 --> 01:02:12.710
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

01:02:12.744 --> 01:02:14.012
Shit. Shit.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.514
Just try
to remain calm, sir.

01:02:16.547 --> 01:02:18.383
What is your emergency?

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:20.249
I...

01:02:20.485 --> 01:02:22.621
Start by giving
me your name and your address.

01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:25.356
Don't tell me what to do.

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:28.126
Don't you ever tell me
what to do, you understand?

01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:30.395
Sir,
yes, I understand.

01:02:30.429 --> 01:02:32.231
But how can I help you?

01:02:32.264 --> 01:02:33.632
I won't let her take my kids.

01:02:35.067 --> 01:02:36.568
She can't take them.

01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:37.670
They're mine.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.672
Sir, I need
to know where you are

01:02:40.704 --> 01:02:43.342
so that I can send help.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:46.210
14 Independence Square.

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:48.247
I'll shoot her if she leaves.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.315
You have to stop her.

01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:53.786
If she tries to take my
kids, I'll fucking kill her.

01:02:53.818 --> 01:02:55.186
Where are you now?

01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:58.123
In the kitchen.

01:02:58.155 --> 01:03:00.324
Okay.
And where is she?

01:03:00.358 --> 01:03:01.293
In the closet.

01:03:04.429 --> 01:03:05.463
Are you sending someone?

01:03:05.496 --> 01:03:07.132
Yes, officers
have been dispatched.

01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:08.467
Now, I'm gonna need
you to stay on the-

01:03:09.534 --> 01:03:10.836
Yes.

01:03:10.869 --> 01:03:11.771
Oh, shit.

01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:28.219
What do you think it's like
to pull a gun on someone?

01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:37.695
Is this what it's like
in your fucking game?

01:03:40.498 --> 01:03:42.634
It's hard to breathe,
your heart races?

01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:45.237
Can you hear it
pounding in your ears?

01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:48.306
I heard a glass break, a
girl scream, he was yelling.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.442
I had to do something!

01:03:50.474 --> 01:03:52.443
They say, "Stick to the facts."

01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:54.112
He was angry, he had a weapon,

01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.848
he didn't respond
to instructions.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.750
The fuck was I supposed to do?!

01:03:58.782 --> 01:04:02.387
He took his last breath,
scared and alone,

01:04:03.722 --> 01:04:06.625
without anyone who loved him.

01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:09.661
- And you stole him from them.
- No justice, no peace!

01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:12.730
- They deserve justice.
- No justice, no peace!

01:04:12.764 --> 01:04:15.200
- No justice, no peace!
- You did this to him.

01:04:15.233 --> 01:04:17.469
- Fucking say it.
- No justice, no peace!

01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:19.471
No justice, no peace!

01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:21.706
- You killed him.
- No justice, no peace!

01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:22.640
- Say it!
- No.

01:04:22.673 --> 01:04:23.708
Look at me. Look at me!

01:04:23.742 --> 01:04:25.444
You killed him!

01:04:25.476 --> 01:04:26.511
I didn't kill anyone!

01:04:26.545 --> 01:04:28.547
- No justice, no peace!
- Say it!

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:30.215
- I said say it!
- No justice, no peace!

01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:31.383
I'm fine! Call it in!

01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:32.317
This is Unit 451.

01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:33.485
Shots fired. Suspect down.

01:04:33.518 --> 01:04:34.653
We need an ambulance.

01:04:34.686 --> 01:04:37.389
Repeat, shots
fired. Suspect down.

01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:38.657
Police! Get on
the fucking ground!

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.425
What?!

01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:46.197
FBI!

01:04:47.264 --> 01:04:47.900
Clear?

01:04:49.601 --> 01:04:50.635
Hello?

01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:53.639
This is Federal Agent
Mayo. Is anyone home?

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.811
Kitchen.

01:05:00.844 --> 01:05:02.180
Here. All right.

01:05:03.648 --> 01:05:04.483
Clear.

01:05:06.384 --> 01:05:07.519
Officer Bishop?

01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:10.588
Stay close.

01:05:15.927 --> 01:05:16.762
FBI.

01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:22.734
Stay on it.

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:28.908
Clear.

01:05:39.784 --> 01:05:40.818
Ready.

01:05:42.753 --> 01:05:44.222
- Cover me.
- Mm-hm.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:47.792
On three.

01:05:47.826 --> 01:05:48.760
One.

01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:49.628
Two.

01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:50.829
Three.

01:05:53.664 --> 01:05:54.800
We got a body!

01:06:00.639 --> 01:06:01.840
Where's Officer Bishop?!

01:06:01.873 --> 01:06:02.773
I don't know.

01:06:02.806 --> 01:06:04.742
Where is he, you little shit?!

01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:05.710
I don't know.

01:06:06.644 --> 01:06:07.713
God dammit.

01:07:18.016 --> 01:07:19.652
What
do you want, man?

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:26.724
Sir, I want you and
your family to know

01:07:26.757 --> 01:07:28.626
exactly what
happened that night.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.762
Well, if you're
here for forgiveness,

01:07:30.795 --> 01:07:32.664
I think it's best you leave.

01:07:33.831 --> 01:07:37.802
No, that's not my
intention at all.

01:07:40.472 --> 01:07:42.674
Andre was a better son than
I could've ever asked for,

01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:45.777
and you took him,
you took him from us.

01:07:47.778 --> 01:07:50.114
You know what it's like raising
a son to fear the people

01:07:50.148 --> 01:07:52.851
who are supposed to protect him?

01:07:54.719 --> 01:07:58.824
You know what it's like to
live with that fear? Huh?

01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:03.094
Papa Al?

01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:06.097
Who's at the door?

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.034
Oh, it's the cop.

01:08:10.969 --> 01:08:13.505
He wants to tell
us what happened,

01:08:14.706 --> 01:08:16.942
tell us how he killed my son.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.948
Ain't that what you wanna do?

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:26.952
Papa Al?

01:08:34.826 --> 01:08:35.926
Let him in.

01:08:56.448 --> 01:08:58.884
And when Andre
opened the door that night

01:09:00.716 --> 01:09:02.153
and saw me, I panicked.

01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:06.158
I saw his jersey
and his tattoos,

01:09:07.559 --> 01:09:10.028
and he had a broken
bottle in his hand.

01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:15.667
I was scared.

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.743
I judged what I
saw and I shot him

01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:27.912
- on his way to the trash.
- Oh!

01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:29.948
- Just stop it.
- Come on.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:30.948
Let's go, let's go.

01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:32.216
Come on, let's get some air.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.519
Come on, now.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.988
I just wanted you
to know the truth.

01:09:54.104 --> 01:09:56.174
Your husband was a good man.

01:09:58.275 --> 01:09:59.811
I took his life.

01:10:01.779 --> 01:10:03.949
And I know there's nothing

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:08.720
nothing I can do
to bring him back.

01:10:15.092 --> 01:10:17.061
And I'm so sorry for that.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:23.935
Mm.

01:10:32.143 --> 01:10:33.244
Andre is gone

01:10:40.018 --> 01:10:41.019
because of you.

01:10:48.158 --> 01:10:49.961
You killed my husband.

01:10:53.698 --> 01:10:57.102
And now, you just walk
in here and apologize,

01:10:58.269 --> 01:11:00.972
and expect for
everything to be over?

01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:15.119
Why is it always us?

01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:21.292
What do you see
when you look at us?

01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:29.067
I mean, it's not anything new.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.802
But everyone always wants us

01:11:30.835 --> 01:11:33.939
to accept your
apologies and move on.

01:11:43.948 --> 01:11:45.117
I won't do it.

01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:30.195
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:31.229
I fucked up.

01:12:34.431 --> 01:12:35.934
Glad you called.

01:12:58.922 --> 01:13:02.893
People of the State of
California versus William Bishop.

01:13:02.926 --> 01:13:05.363
Case number BA19107.

01:13:07.765 --> 01:13:10.168
The matter is here
for arraignment.

01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:12.037
All parties are present.

01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:14.806
I've reviewed the
evidence in this case

01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:16.740
as well as the obstruction
of justice charge

01:13:16.774 --> 01:13:18.176
against Chase Miller.

01:13:19.277 --> 01:13:21.012
Absolutely senseless.

01:13:22.145 --> 01:13:22.980
Tragic.

01:13:25.216 --> 01:13:26.417
These are the words
that come to mind

01:13:26.451 --> 01:13:30.389
on a case the details of which
I've never seen this before.

01:13:34.024 --> 01:13:36.027
Will the defendant please rise?

01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:45.804
Mr. Bishop, your attorney has
indicated it is your intention

01:13:45.837 --> 01:13:48.139
to enter into a not guilty plea

01:13:48.171 --> 01:13:52.276
to count one of this complaint,
voluntary manslaughter,

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:56.847
a violation of Penal Code
section 192, subsection A.

01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:57.716
Correct?

01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:00.184
Yes.

01:14:02.453 --> 01:14:04.322
Is that
correct, Mr. Bishop?

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.063
No. No, Your Honor.

01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.965
Counsel, what's going on here

01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:17.034
Your honor, may I have a
moment to speak with my client?

01:14:17.068 --> 01:14:18.869
Yes.

01:14:18.903 --> 01:14:20.137
You can't do this.

01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:22.273
You need to plead not guilty.

01:14:22.305 --> 01:14:24.475
Do you understand the risk
you're putting on the department?

01:14:25.408 --> 01:14:27.177
This is a complicated case.

01:14:27.211 --> 01:14:28.780
No jury will find you guilty.

01:14:28.813 --> 01:14:30.148
- I made up my mind.
- Your honor,

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.381
if we could have a short recess?

01:14:31.414 --> 01:14:33.083
I would like to
speak with my client.

01:14:33.117 --> 01:14:36.454
Your honor, I'm guilty
of the charges against me.

01:14:38.389 --> 01:14:41.226
Mr. Bishop, sir, this
is your arraignment.

01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:43.895
It's unheard of to enter into
a guilty plea at this time.

01:14:43.927 --> 01:14:46.765
Are you sure that's what
you want to do, sir?

01:14:46.797 --> 01:14:47.998
Yes, Your Honor.

01:14:52.336 --> 01:14:53.805
Mr. Bishop, do you
waive and give up

01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:56.240
your right to a jury trial,

01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:59.043
the right to confront and
cross-examine witnesses,

01:14:59.076 --> 01:15:02.346
and to present evidence and
testimony on your own behalf?

01:15:05.082 --> 01:15:07.152
Yes, I give up my
right, Your Honor.

01:15:08.319 --> 01:15:10.388
Let the record reflect
that the defendant willingly,

01:15:10.421 --> 01:15:12.289
knowingly, and
understandably has entered

01:15:12.323 --> 01:15:16.394
into a plea of guilty to
the charge of manslaughter.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:21.298
The clerk will have
him initial and sign

01:15:21.332 --> 01:15:23.201
a formal plea agreement.

01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:26.137
Counsel, do you waive
time for sentencing?

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:27.439
Yes, Your Honor.

01:15:29.073 --> 01:15:32.077
Formal sentencing will be
held one week from today.

01:15:34.212 --> 01:15:37.515
Mr. Bishop, your OR
status is hereby revoked.

01:15:37.547 --> 01:15:40.918
Bailiff, he is to be remanded
into custody forthwith.

01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.322
We're done here.

01:15:45.256 --> 01:15:47.258
Court's adjourned.

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.162
You just hung yourself
and the department. Nice.

01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:19.157
Bishop.

01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:21.960
I'm floored. I'm floored.

01:16:21.993 --> 01:16:23.862
Listen, just talk to Jan.

01:16:23.895 --> 01:16:26.498
You can't just
leave her like this.

01:16:28.099 --> 01:16:30.368
I don't know
what to say to her.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.836
She still loves you.

01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:36.273
Thank you.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.235
I'm sorry.

01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:16.915
This is the right thing.

01:17:25.355 --> 01:17:26.423
I love you.

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:29.194
I love you.

01:17:31.494 --> 01:17:33.030
Oh, god.

01:17:55.426 --> 01:17:59.293
