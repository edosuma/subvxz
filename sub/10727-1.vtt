Ohh, yeah!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:19.820 --> 00:22.121
Oh! Yeah!

00:33.734 --> 00:36.535
Sensitive thugz
is the best band of all time.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.437
All time.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.072
And my main man Dax

00:40.107 --> 00:42.541
is like the baddest boy
the world's ever seen.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.044
He takes guff from no one.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.179
Except the people he lets in.

00:47.214 --> 00:51.450
And their manager, Kevonne, has
such an eye for organization.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.152
He'll keep
their profiles growing

00:53.187 --> 00:54.787
long after they become obsolete.

00:54.822 --> 00:58.357
That was "I want to listen
to your problems, gurl"

00:58.392 --> 00:59.691
by the sensitive thugz.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.595
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.197
It's your last chance
to win tickets

01:05.232 --> 01:06.799
for their sold-out show
tonight.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.600
Get those phones out
because the tickets will go

01:08.636 --> 01:10.402
to the listener who
can answer this question...

01:10.438 --> 01:13.639
If chance, the lead singer
of the sensitive thugz,

01:13.674 --> 01:17.109
could have any animal as a pet,
what would it be?

01:18.345 --> 01:19.745
Hello, what's your name?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.214
This is Bubbles
from central Townsville.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.250
Chance would have a wallaby
because they're sweet,

01:25.286 --> 01:28.153
but also tough, just like
the sensitive thugz.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.822
True dat, girl.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.291
Congratulations, Bubbles!

01:32.326 --> 01:35.127
Because you
and one guest of your choice

01:35.162 --> 01:37.596
are seeing sensitive thugz
tonight!

01:37.631 --> 01:39.765
Ahhh!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.733
I did it, I did it, I did it!

01:41.769 --> 01:43.402
You won, you won, you won!

01:45.306 --> 01:48.440
I can't believe I won!

01:48.476 --> 01:51.176
Now you just have to decide
who to take!

01:51.212 --> 01:52.878
Yeah, 'cause you can...

01:52.913 --> 01:54.413
Only take...

01:54.448 --> 01:55.614
One of us.

01:57.184 --> 02:00.786
Oh, yeah! 'Cause there's
only... Two tickets.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.523
So... Bubbles.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.525
Who are you, uh,
thinking of taking, huh?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.394
Um... I guess... Um...

02:09.430 --> 02:10.562
I'll take...

02:11.699 --> 02:13.232
that phone call.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.567
Hello, this is Bubbles
from central Townsville.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.769
Mayday! Mayday!

02:17.805 --> 02:19.505
Mayor?
What's the matter?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.773
There's something wrong
with my plane.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.408
It doesn't seem to have...

02:23.444 --> 02:24.476
A pilot.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.345
Aah!

02:26.380 --> 02:28.180
Don't worry, mayor!
We're on our way.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.215
Let's go!

02:30.351 --> 02:32.217
The mayor's distress signal

02:32.253 --> 02:35.254
was coming from somewhere
near monster island.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.222
That's a dangerous place!

02:37.258 --> 02:38.790
Look!
There it is!

02:39.860 --> 02:41.727
Hey, it's the mayor's plane!

02:41.762 --> 02:44.196
But where's the mayor?

02:44.231 --> 02:45.731
This place is creepy.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.834
What's that?

02:50.738 --> 02:53.172
Oh, my gosh!
He's so cute!

02:53.207 --> 02:55.807
But not as cute as you, girl.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.277
Be careful!
He might be dangerous!

03:00.648 --> 03:04.683
His name is Frederick,
and he's not dangerous.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.766
Yeah!

03:20.801 --> 03:22.868
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

03:22.903 --> 03:25.304
Come on.
We have to find the mayor.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.173
Aw, man! That fight was
just getting started!

03:28.209 --> 03:30.542
That spiky monster was
gonna do something big!

03:30.578 --> 03:32.611
You see?!

03:34.481 --> 03:36.815
Good thing you found
the mayor's tracks, Frederick.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.617
Hey, Bubbles!

03:38.652 --> 03:41.453
Did you know that chance's
middle name is also Frederick?

03:41.488 --> 03:43.488
Oh.
No, I did not.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.958
Well, there's a lot more
sensitive thugz knowledge

03:45.993 --> 03:48.527
where that came from
that I'd be happy to share

03:48.562 --> 03:49.728
with you later tonight.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.496
She'll just yammer on

03:51.532 --> 03:53.365
about that dorky nonsense
forever.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.667
Hey!
At least I'm a fan.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.536
A fan of your own voice.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.239
Oh, is that right?
Well, let me tell you something.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.406
Girls!

04:01.442 --> 04:02.808
We're never gonna find the mayor

04:02.843 --> 04:04.409
if you keep fighting like that.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.677
Now, be nice to each other.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.878
Fine.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.413
Okay. Now hug.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.184
Say "I love you."

04:12.219 --> 04:14.853
I love you.
I love you.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.521
Now say "I'm a buttzilla."

04:16.557 --> 04:18.490
I'm a buttzilla.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.760
You're a buttzilla.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.796
Hey! What? Wait!
Blossom!

04:24.832 --> 04:26.932
Say you're a buttzilla.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.803
Aah!

04:36.810 --> 04:39.945
That was...
Um... Unexpected.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.351
I think he smells something.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.858
Um... Where are we?

04:56.330 --> 04:57.929
It looks like we're inside a...

04:57.965 --> 04:59.064
Volcano!
Volcano!

04:59.099 --> 05:00.699
Jinx!

05:00.734 --> 05:04.770
You can't talk till someone
says your full name, dude!

05:04.805 --> 05:07.306
That's for calling me
a buttzilla.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.908
Aww. Are you two
getting along now?

05:09.943 --> 05:13.779
Sure are.
Isn't that right, Bloss?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.647
That is just so very great!

05:16.750 --> 05:18.450
The mayor's hat!

05:18.485 --> 05:20.419
He must have been down here.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.861
She seems... Nice.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.002
Bubbles, we really got to work
on your definition of "nice."

05:40.674 --> 05:42.607
Don't you think
using your ice breath

05:42.643 --> 05:43.909
is kind of like talking?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.845
Bloss-sister?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.780
Oh, snap, girl.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.483
You best recognize
the rules of jinx.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.552
Don't worry, Bubbles.
I got this.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.389
Hey! Lava lady!

06:00.461 --> 06:02.494
You're not so hot.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.736
Dax would be proud.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.638
Yeah, girl.
You know I am.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.807
Yay!

06:25.552 --> 06:27.719
That was awesome, Buttercup!

06:27.755 --> 06:29.020
Yeah, well.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.859
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.864
Hoo-hoo!

06:38.899 --> 06:42.100
Ohh, it's about the sensitive
thugz tickets, isn't it?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.035
Well, if you're
gonna be like that,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.805
then I'm just gonna give
my other ticket to Buttercup.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.807
Yes!

06:48.842 --> 06:51.543
Sorry, Blossom.
I just think that...

06:52.780 --> 06:55.680
She said your full name, girl.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.616
Now you can unbottle
those feelings

06:57.651 --> 07:00.152
and spill out your heart, girl.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.456
Buttercup jinxed me as payback

07:04.491 --> 07:06.625
because she called herself
a buttzilla alone!

07:06.660 --> 07:08.126
She doesn't deserve the ticket!

07:08.162 --> 07:10.662
Whatever, dude!

07:10.697 --> 07:13.098
You're just jealous!
I totally deserve that ticket.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.600
You do not!

07:15.636 --> 07:18.136
Oh, and the volcano
is about to erupt.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.810
So you guys never
stopped fighting?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.611
She never stopped first!

07:26.647 --> 07:28.480
That doesn't even make sense!

07:28.515 --> 07:30.882
Buttercup, I am not
taking you anymore.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.684
What?
Yes!

07:32.719 --> 07:35.587
It seems like the only person
I can count on is frede...

07:35.622 --> 07:37.823
Rick.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.930
Frederick!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.570
Come on, bubbs!

07:51.605 --> 07:53.839
You... Gotta... Decide!

07:56.143 --> 07:59.578
Pick... One...

07:59.613 --> 08:01.580
Of... Us!

08:01.615 --> 08:03.648
Eeeeee-nough!

08:07.087 --> 08:08.453
Frederick!

08:12.993 --> 08:16.094
All right. There's only one way
to settle this.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.029
Rap battle.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.498
Bubbs is the judge.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.533
Wait, what?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.603
Unh! Yeah!

08:24.638 --> 08:27.072
Well, my name is
Blossom, and I'm here to say...

08:27.107 --> 08:29.841
No! No rapping!

08:29.877 --> 08:31.743
You two have gotten so greedy

08:31.778 --> 08:34.446
that you forgot why we're here!

08:34.481 --> 08:36.014
We need to find the may...

08:43.557 --> 08:45.524
Frederick! Help!

08:47.160 --> 08:49.160
Wow, super helpful.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.563
Glad to have you
part of the team, pal.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.073
Aw, man!

09:02.109 --> 09:03.675
Being devoured by monsters

09:03.710 --> 09:05.777
is really low
on my list of ways to die.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.479
Bubbles...

09:07.514 --> 09:12.083
We... I was being selfish,
and I completely lost focus.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.589
And we've been really lame
with the fighting

09:17.624 --> 09:19.925
and the jinxing and...
And...

09:19.960 --> 09:23.461
We... we're sorry that
we got you into this mess.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.008
Aaah!

09:45.986 --> 09:47.886
Hey, girls!

09:47.921 --> 09:50.855
H-how did you even...
When did you...

09:50.891 --> 09:53.692
How did you not get
eaten by those monsters?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.227
Oh, these monsters are darling!

09:56.263 --> 09:58.663
They go nuts for my pickles!

09:58.699 --> 10:01.800
So all you had to do
to keep the monsters tame

10:01.835 --> 10:03.068
is feed them pickles?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.837
Yep! Ooh,
and that was the last one.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.042
Okay.
Time to go.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.614
Sorry we were being
such buttzillas.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.148
It's all right, girls.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.851
But I do think I know who
I'm gonna take to the concert.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.586
Please be me, please be me.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.655
Please be me, please be me.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.691
Is it me?
It is me, right?

10:26.727 --> 10:29.594
Tell me it's me.
You can tell me it's me.

10:37.771 --> 10:42.240
Hey. This song goes out
to our number-one fan, Bubbles.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.675
Oh, my gosh!

10:43.710 --> 10:46.845
It's called "I'm a crazy
dangerous monster"

10:46.880 --> 10:50.015
when it comes to holding
your hand, girl."

10:51.685 --> 10:52.984
Yay!

10:55.188 --> 10:57.789
I'm a crazy monster, girl

11:06.655 --> 11:10.157
Ah, lunchtime
at the school cafeteria.

11:10.159 --> 11:11.458
Cute ribbons.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.793
Ooh, glitter!

11:12.795 --> 11:14.828
Scrapbooking is so awesome!

11:14.830 --> 11:15.762
Yay!

11:15.764 --> 11:18.365
Dudes!
It's sloppy Joe Tuesday!

11:18.367 --> 11:20.200
They should make this a holiday.

11:20.202 --> 11:22.869
Um, what happened
to your forehead?

11:22.871 --> 11:26.039
Oh, that? Funny story.
Check it.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.875
So there's this guy
at the construction yard, Mac.

11:28.877 --> 11:32.946
So he says his forklift
can crush anything... anything!

11:32.948 --> 11:35.749
And I'm all like,
"I'm stronger than that."

11:35.751 --> 11:40.053
And anyway,
I arm-wrestled a forklift.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.521
Oh.

11:41.523 --> 11:42.622
Interesting.

11:42.624 --> 11:44.958
Uh, hey, Buttercup.

11:44.960 --> 11:49.830
Do you want to, uh, sit with us
and, you know, chew?

11:49.832 --> 11:51.932
We're talking about
scrapbooking!

11:51.934 --> 11:53.500
Uh, yeah.

11:53.502 --> 11:54.534
No.

11:54.536 --> 11:55.769
That's not really my thing.

11:55.771 --> 11:57.437
I'll just grab a seat
over there.

11:58.841 --> 12:01.141
Pfft.
Scrapbooking.

12:15.791 --> 12:19.025
Hey.
You're Buttercup, right?

12:19.027 --> 12:20.026
Who's asking?

12:20.028 --> 12:22.762
I'm Maylyn,
head of the derbytantes.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.899
Dig your head scrape.

12:25.901 --> 12:28.235
You get that from fighting
a monster or something?

12:28.237 --> 12:30.670
Forklift.

12:30.672 --> 12:32.606
Dig your skates.

12:32.608 --> 12:34.508
Yeah.
We never take them off.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.343
We grind on skates.

12:36.345 --> 12:38.478
We skateboard on skates.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.481
We even do pottery on skates.

12:41.483 --> 12:42.949
Best work yet.

12:42.951 --> 12:44.151
Thanks!

12:45.521 --> 12:46.987
Whoo! Whoo!

12:46.989 --> 12:50.123
We also play deathball
on skates.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.758
Whoa. Back up.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.693
What's deathball?

12:53.695 --> 12:55.362
You should find out.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.900
Hey, Buttercup.
Who are your friends?

12:59.902 --> 13:03.203
Do they want to come
scrapbooking, too?

13:03.205 --> 13:05.105
Deathball.

13:07.075 --> 13:09.276
Hey, girls.

13:09.278 --> 13:10.710
Princess morbucks?

13:12.648 --> 13:15.849
I see butterbutt has
left you for new friends.

13:15.851 --> 13:17.150
No, she's just off...

13:17.152 --> 13:18.218
Playing deathball...

13:18.220 --> 13:19.786
With some people.

13:19.788 --> 13:22.556
Well, if you need a replacement,

13:22.558 --> 13:25.258
I know a stunningly
gorgeous redhead

13:25.260 --> 13:28.395
with loads of sass
and gobs of cash.

13:28.397 --> 13:29.863
Mike drop!

13:29.865 --> 13:31.698
We don't need a replacement.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.167
Come on, Bubbles.
We'll see Buttercup later.

13:35.437 --> 13:37.370
Sure you will.

13:37.372 --> 13:39.239
"Later."

13:40.642 --> 13:42.609
Where's Buttercup?

13:42.611 --> 13:44.177
Deathball!

13:45.547 --> 13:47.147
Where's Buttercup?

13:48.517 --> 13:49.816
Ow!

13:49.818 --> 13:51.685
Where's Buttercup?

13:55.557 --> 13:58.358
I miss Buttercup.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.694
Deathball!

14:07.135 --> 14:09.669
Buttercup, Buttercup, Buttercup!

14:09.671 --> 14:12.472
Buttercup, Buttercup, Buttercup!

14:14.009 --> 14:16.576
Hey, guys. You see that
butt-whupping I just gave?

14:16.578 --> 14:18.612
Oh, yeah.
You did great.

14:18.614 --> 14:21.214
Thanks.
So... What's up?

14:21.216 --> 14:23.650
Well, we noticed that
you've been hanging out

14:23.652 --> 14:25.085
with your new friends a lot,

14:25.087 --> 14:27.020
and we thought
that we would come by

14:27.022 --> 14:28.888
and bring you some lunch
and stuff.

14:28.890 --> 14:30.690
We brought leftover lasagna.

14:30.692 --> 14:33.393
Everything chill
over here, Buttlyn?

14:33.395 --> 14:34.761
Uh, Buttlyn?

14:35.897 --> 14:37.430
That's my new nickname.

14:37.432 --> 14:39.966
Everyone in the gang has names
that rhyme with "lyn."

14:39.968 --> 14:41.735
This is Maylyn.
'Sup?

14:41.737 --> 14:43.036
Jaylyn.
Yo.

14:43.038 --> 14:45.705
And bobbysuzerae... Lyn.

14:45.707 --> 14:46.840
Hi, guys.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.742
Come on, Buttlyn, let's bolt.

14:50.646 --> 14:52.379
See you cats on the flip side.

14:52.381 --> 14:53.513
Buttercup, wait!

14:54.449 --> 14:58.451
I should have called it
death-lasagna.

14:59.321 --> 15:01.688
We've lost our sister,
haven't we?

15:01.690 --> 15:03.089
Don't be silly, Bubbles!

15:03.091 --> 15:06.259
Buttercup is just being,
well, Buttercup.

15:06.261 --> 15:07.394
I guess.

15:07.396 --> 15:09.796
Hey, super gal pals!

15:09.798 --> 15:11.798
Looks like there's an opening

15:11.800 --> 15:14.734
now that your sister
ditched you.

15:16.271 --> 15:17.971
Ahh!

15:17.973 --> 15:19.606
She didn't ditch us.

15:19.608 --> 15:20.840
Yes, she did.

15:20.842 --> 15:23.743
And I want to be
a powerpuff girl.

15:23.745 --> 15:25.879
There is an opening, after all.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.781
She does have a point.

15:27.783 --> 15:29.215
No, she doesn't.

15:29.217 --> 15:31.284
Bubbles, she can't even fly.

15:31.286 --> 15:32.552
Powerboots!

15:32.554 --> 15:33.653
Big deal.

15:33.655 --> 15:34.921
You don't have any superpowers.

15:34.923 --> 15:37.724
Powergloves!

15:37.726 --> 15:40.560
Well, you don't even
have a costume.

15:40.562 --> 15:42.529
Power-threads!

15:43.632 --> 15:45.632
So am I in or what?

15:45.634 --> 15:47.067
Just... no.

15:47.069 --> 15:49.936
Look, Buttercup is our sister.

15:49.938 --> 15:51.404
And we're a team.

15:51.406 --> 15:54.741
She'll always be there for us,
no matter what.

15:54.743 --> 15:56.209
Hmph!

15:56.211 --> 16:00.447
Oh, really?
Well, then, let's find out.

16:02.384 --> 16:05.318
<i>Initiate monster attack.</i>

16:09.191 --> 16:12.459
<i>Monster needed 2.3 miles.</i>

16:16.598 --> 16:17.864
Showtime.

16:21.169 --> 16:25.405
Fear me
for I am an evil monster!

16:27.976 --> 16:31.578
Feel my wrath,
oh, citizens of Townsville!

16:31.580 --> 16:33.713
Trouble!
Let's go, Bubbles!

16:33.715 --> 16:35.315
But what about Buttercup?

16:35.317 --> 16:36.383
She'll be there!

16:37.619 --> 16:40.387
We'll just see about that.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.394
Man, this is the most fun
I think I've ever had.

16:47.396 --> 16:48.862
I know, right?

16:48.864 --> 16:51.631
No thanks to you losers.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.000
Awesome!

16:56.705 --> 16:58.972
Oh! Scoundrels.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.908
Whoa, no!
My sisters need me!

17:01.910 --> 17:03.143
Whoa.

17:03.145 --> 17:04.743
What's your hurry, Buttlyn?

17:04.746 --> 17:08.348
We're about to order some pizzas
and huck 'em on the rooves!

17:08.349 --> 17:11.017
I'll hang later.
Duty calls.

17:11.019 --> 17:13.353
But the pizzas will get cold.

17:13.355 --> 17:15.622
We'll order more.
I got to go.

17:16.425 --> 17:19.159
Sorry, Buttlyn.
Can't let you do that.

17:19.161 --> 17:20.827
Maylyn, what do you mean?

17:20.829 --> 17:22.662
Princess moneyface or whatever

17:22.664 --> 17:25.732
is paying us to keep you away
from your sisters.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.434
Moneyface?

17:27.435 --> 17:29.369
Moneyface.

17:29.371 --> 17:30.270
Morbucks?!

17:30.272 --> 17:32.338
Yeah. Yeah.
Moneybutt.

17:32.340 --> 17:34.574
She paid us
to hang out with you.

17:36.211 --> 17:39.245
So you're not really my friends.

17:39.247 --> 17:41.414
No, we are.
You're cool and all,

17:41.416 --> 17:44.150
but we need monies
for skates and junk.

17:44.152 --> 17:46.019
You understand, right?

17:46.021 --> 17:50.490
The only thing I understand
is that my sisters need me.

17:50.492 --> 17:52.792
Now get out of my way.

17:55.397 --> 17:57.096
Where's Buttercup?

17:57.098 --> 17:59.199
She'll be here any sec.

17:59.201 --> 18:01.634
Huh?

18:01.636 --> 18:04.037
Yah! Hah! Ugh! Yah!

18:04.039 --> 18:06.005
Huh! Ha! Nyah!

18:06.007 --> 18:08.141
Need someone to lend a hand?

18:08.143 --> 18:11.211
My offer's still on
the very expensive table!

18:11.213 --> 18:12.011
Fine.

18:12.013 --> 18:13.313
Whatever...

18:13.315 --> 18:14.414
You... Want!

18:14.416 --> 18:16.716
I want to be a powerpuff girl!

18:16.718 --> 18:18.151
Okay!

18:18.153 --> 18:20.253
You're a power...

18:20.255 --> 18:21.754
Puff... Girl!

18:21.756 --> 18:23.056
Yes!

18:23.058 --> 18:26.726
And soon I'll be
the only powerpuff girl.

18:28.763 --> 18:32.432
Excuse me.
I think we're done here.

18:35.136 --> 18:37.103
<i>Monstering complete.</i>

18:37.105 --> 18:39.472
That was a four-star performance
if I ever saw one.

18:39.474 --> 18:41.274
You better give me
a good rating.

18:41.276 --> 18:46.246
Oh, the folly of my ways!

18:47.182 --> 18:48.848
This is for Blossom!

18:48.850 --> 18:50.183
This is for Bubbles!

18:50.185 --> 18:53.453
This is for me!
This is also for me!

18:56.091 --> 18:58.725
<i>Skates.</i>

18:58.727 --> 19:00.059
<i>Buttercup.</i>

19:01.596 --> 19:03.863
That kid's all right.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.568
Buttercup didn't come.

19:08.570 --> 19:10.103
Maybe she...

19:11.573 --> 19:14.440
Thanks for making me
part of the team, girls.

19:14.442 --> 19:18.945
I got you a little something
as a token of my appreciation.

19:20.048 --> 19:21.881
Ooh. Pretty.

19:23.251 --> 19:24.417
Hey!

19:24.419 --> 19:28.555
It's an necronium diamond...
Indestructible.

19:30.025 --> 19:33.259
Ah, because
a true superstar... me...

19:33.261 --> 19:35.662
Knows when it's time to go solo.

19:35.664 --> 19:39.132
After all, I'm pretty much
the most beautiful,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.901
most talented,
most powerful, most...

19:41.903 --> 19:44.103
Most annoying.

19:44.105 --> 19:46.406
Buttercup!

19:47.842 --> 19:50.910
Buttercup!

19:50.912 --> 19:52.579
Stand back!

19:54.583 --> 19:56.115
Hey, girls.

19:56.117 --> 19:59.619
Look what I got
for my half un-birthday.

20:01.022 --> 20:03.723
This is going to be too easy.

20:03.725 --> 20:05.825
Aw, man.

20:07.362 --> 20:09.495
Wait. Check this out.
It came with the suit.

20:09.497 --> 20:12.365
You'll
never save your sisters now.

20:12.367 --> 20:15.134
You like that?
'Cause it's true.

20:15.136 --> 20:18.871
Yeah, not really true,
like, at all.

20:18.873 --> 20:22.508
You see, the derbytantes,
we protect our sisters,

20:22.510 --> 20:25.078
and that includes
sisters of sisters.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.081
I thought you were
working for moneypants.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.616
Why should I trust you?

20:29.618 --> 20:32.251
Yeah, you're supposed to be
working for me.

20:32.253 --> 20:35.722
Buttercup earned our respect.
You just paid for it.

20:35.724 --> 20:38.658
Come on. If there's
one thing we're good at,

20:38.660 --> 20:40.360
it's thrashing stuff.

20:40.362 --> 20:42.161
Rock and roll, ladies!

20:46.067 --> 20:48.101
Blades up, girls!

20:55.877 --> 20:58.044
Anyone for a game of deathball?

20:58.046 --> 20:59.746
Deathball!

21:08.289 --> 21:10.823
Okay, we'll call it a draw.

21:10.825 --> 21:12.792
Aaaaaaah!

21:13.628 --> 21:16.896
Buttercup! I thought you were
gone forever and ever

21:16.898 --> 21:18.598
and ever and ever and ever!

21:18.600 --> 21:20.133
Sorry I got so carried away

21:20.135 --> 21:21.634
hanging out
with the derbytantes.

21:21.636 --> 21:24.570
I guess I forgot
who my real friends are.

21:24.572 --> 21:26.706
We're not just friends,
we're sisters.

21:26.708 --> 21:30.243
Yeah! And we're sorry
we replaced you with morbucks!

21:30.245 --> 21:31.477
Wait, what?

21:31.479 --> 21:33.246
And so, once again,

21:33.248 --> 21:36.215
the day is saved
by the powerpuff girls!

21:36.217 --> 21:38.284
And deathball!
