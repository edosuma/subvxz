Oh. Charlie?

00:36.454 --> 00:37.788
Don't understand why it's not
working. Think Charlie, think.

[Angel] Yikes.

00:44.754 --> 00:46.797
- [Vaggie] Charlie?...Sweetie,
- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Charlie!

00:46.797 --> 00:48.424
You, uh. You good?

00:48.424 --> 00:50.509
Nope, no! Not really! Haha!

00:50.718 --> 00:53.637
I've been up all night trying to
figure out why the hotel isn't working.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.223
We've done trust falls. We've
tried sharing our feelings.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.476
We only have a couple months
left before the angels come.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.144
[Manic laughter]

01:00.144 --> 01:01.729
- And at this rate...
- [Vaggie] Maybe it's time...

01:01.729 --> 01:03.189
- No.
- to ask...

01:03.189 --> 01:04.440
Don't say it.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.566
your dad.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.777
[Charlie groans]

01:07.777 --> 01:10.237
Charlie, I know you don't want to,
but we need every advantage we can get.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.865
He let the extermination
happen to begin with.

01:12.865 --> 01:16.285
They just had a meeting and
said, "Go ahead and kill everyone!"

01:16.285 --> 01:17.286
[gasps]

01:17.286 --> 01:19.622
Wait. That's it.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.332
- [Vaggie] Kill everyone?
- No.

01:21.332 --> 01:24.293
He could get me a meeting
with Heaven.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.212
Didn't we already try that?

01:26.212 --> 01:29.590
Well, yeah, with Adam,
he was an asshole.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.550
But he isn't in charge
of all of Heaven.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.427
We could go to the top!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.513
There's sure to be
some angels who will listen.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.807
[Husk] What's the holdup?

01:37.807 --> 01:39.266
You got daddy issues?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.519
No, we just have
never been close.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.397
After he and Mom split, he never
really wanted to see me.

01:45.606 --> 01:50.361
He calls... sometimes, but only if he's
bored or like, needs me to do something.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.821
Daddy issues.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.739
Well, I'd like to meet
the big dick in charge.

The ultimate bad boy.
[giggles like a gremlin]

01:57.701 --> 01:59.829

H-Hey, heyyy,
CharChar...

02:33.863 --> 02:36.198
No! No, that's not good.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.450
Oh, this is the first time
she's called you in years.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.369
This has to be perfect.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.371
Hey, bitch!

02:42.371 --> 02:43.706
Hi, Dad.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.875
Hey! How are you?
[chuckles]

02:45.875 --> 02:48.752
Wh-wh-where are you these days?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.922
You know where I am, Dad.
I've told you before.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.675
You have?
Oh yeah, uh?

02:55.551 --> 02:57.511
Well, you know I um, uh...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.638
I told you when you
called me five months ago.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.849
Or did you not listen?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.226
No, no, no, no. Just, you know,
just forgot, I've just been really busy!

03:04.226 --> 03:07.771
Ya know with um...
important things.

03:07.771 --> 03:11.442
Well, I'm actually running a
hotel to rehabilitate sinners.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.735
Maybe you saw our commercial.

03:12.735 --> 03:16.238
Oh... sadly I missed it.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.990
Heheh, you know I haven't been
watching much TV lately.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.366
Scrambles the brain.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.409
[laughs]

03:20.409 --> 03:22.953
But, hey, a hotel! Fun!

03:22.953 --> 03:26.957
[sighs] Listen, Dad,
I've got... kind of a big ask.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.460
[coughs]
Yeah, of course.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.420
Anything in my power
is yours for the asking.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.504
You just name it.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.757
I need to speak to Heaven.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.967
Well, whoever's in charge up
there, above Adam, above anybody.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.969
I need to go to the top.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.721
Oh no!

no, no, Charlie</i>

03:44.391 --> 03:47.436
no, no, no, that's, uh...
No.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.772
[frustrated] Look, Dad.
I don't ask you for much.

03:49.772 --> 03:53.901
I never have, but this,
this is really important to me.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.445
It's the most important thing
I've ever done.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.365
And... I need you.

03:59.365 --> 04:00.574
[Charlie] <i>I need your help.</i>

04:00.574 --> 04:02.826

I don't know, Charlie.

04:02.826 --> 04:06.705
Please, just come
see what I'm trying to do.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.832
You'll see why it's
a really good idea.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.627
And Heaven is bound to agree
if I get the chance to talk to them.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.796
Please, Dad.

04:13.796 --> 04:18.634
Wait. You're inviting me over?

04:18.634 --> 04:20.511
Absolutely!

04:20.511 --> 04:23.013
Hoh! I'll be there in an hour!

04:30.437 --> 04:32.731
[Vaggie] Okay, people, Lucifer
is on his way.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.650
So we are going to
get this place presentable,

04:34.650 --> 04:37.569
and we are all going to make
an amazing impression!

04:52.626 --> 04:55.921
Oh, it's so good
to see you. Haha!

05:24.867 --> 05:28.704
Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.706
It's got a lot of character.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.625
Oh, what in the
unholy Hell is that?!

05:33.625 --> 05:36.420
[Alastor] Just some of the
renovations we had done.

don't you think?

05:38.589 --> 05:39.798

And you are?

05:39.798 --> 05:42.718
Alastor!
Pleasure to be meeting you, sir.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.094
Quite a pleasure!

05:44.094 --> 05:46.764
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.767
You are much shorter
in real life.

05:49.767 --> 05:50.726
Who is this? Who's this now?

05:50.726 --> 05:51.977
Are you the bellhop?

05:51.977 --> 05:55.314
Haha! No!
I am the host of the hotel.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.442
You might have heard
of me from my radio broadcast.

05:58.442 --> 06:03.113
Hmm. Nope! I guess that's why
Charlie called it the 'Hazbin' Hotel! Hahaha.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.783
Ha ha ha! It was
actually my idea.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.451
Ha ha ha! Well, it's
not very clever!

06:07.451 --> 06:09.453
Ha ha, fuck you.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.039
Okay! Okay. Anyway.

06:12.039 --> 06:16.919
Dad, look at this lovely parlor,
where people can get to know each other

06:16.919 --> 06:19.880
and share secrets and stories
and intimate feelings!

06:20.422 --> 06:22.424
Without Alastor,

06:22.716 --> 06:25.094
we wouldn't have been
able to pretty it up this much!

06:25.094 --> 06:28.347

has a very unique vision.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.934

06:43.946 --> 06:47.032

to your <i>other</i> friends?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.617
Oh, yes, of course.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.119
This is Vaggie.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.620

Didn't you just hear me?

09:34.992 --> 09:37.035
Why is everybody gawkin'?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.329
Is it, cuz I'm adorable?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.123
Mimzy!

09:41.123 --> 09:43.792
Alastooorr, sweetie, doll-face!

09:43.792 --> 09:45.252
So good to see you.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.754
How you been?
Good? Good.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.298
[squeeze]

09:49.298 --> 09:51.633
Listen, I was in
the neighborhood.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.304
I heard you were staying
at this ritzy slob factory,

09:55.304 --> 09:58.140
and I figured
I'd stop by, say hi!

09:58.140 --> 09:59.891
For old times sake.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.893
Of course, sweetheart!

10:01.893 --> 10:03.687
Everyone is welcome here.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.147
[Charlie] Oh, how nice!

10:05.147 --> 10:06.273
So you two know each other?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.858
Oh, yeah. We go way back,

10:07.858 --> 10:10.193
ran in the same circles
when we were alive.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.322
You know, this one used to
frequent the club where I used to perform.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.991
He's the only one I knew
who could pound whiskey like a sailor

10:15.991 --> 10:18.160
then keep up with me
on the dance floor.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.329
Oh, quite a talent, this gal.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.707
Ho, ho, you should have
seen her in her heyday.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.001
Hey, watch it tall,
dark and creepy.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.003
I'm still in my prime!

10:28.670 --> 10:30.922
Oh, oh my stars!

10:30.922 --> 10:33.008
[gasps]
Is that Lucifer?

10:33.008 --> 10:34.259
Move it!

10:34.259 --> 10:37.721
Pleased to meetcha,
Your Highness.

10:37.721 --> 10:42.684
Alastor, you gotta warn a girl
when she's in mixed company.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.686
Charmed, I'm sure.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.440
As much as I'd love to catch up,
Charlie and I have a tour to continue.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.984
I'm sure Charlie can handle
showing me around.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.861
[Alastor] Nonsense!

10:52.861 --> 10:56.031
We started the hotel together,
and we'll show it off together.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.449
Right, Charlie?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.117
Oh, right.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.370
Why don't you let the
others help you settle in,

11:01.370 --> 11:03.246
and I'll be back before
you know it.

11:04.039 --> 11:07.459
So, where can a girl
get a drink around here?

11:07.459 --> 11:08.752
[grunts]

11:08.752 --> 11:11.004
My, my, is that Husker?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.715
Alastor still has you
slinging hooch for him, I see.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.842
[chuckles]
Classic!

11:15.842 --> 11:17.344
How ya been, fur-ball?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.013
Good until five minutes ago.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.891
Oh, don't tell me
you're not happy to see me.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.768
You might hurt my feelins.
[giggles]

11:25.268 --> 11:27.187
Hey Niffty,
whatcha' been up to, girlie?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.730
Fighting bugs.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.024
[scuttling] And uh,
how's that going for you?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.401
They're winning.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.236
But not for long.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.948
Uh-huh... Thanks, pussy cat!

11:37.948 --> 11:39.241
[Husk]
Oh, fuck you.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.244
So uh, you and Alastor
are like what?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.412
Friends?

11:43.412 --> 11:45.288
Well, that's your
word, not mine,

11:45.288 --> 11:47.082
but I think it fits.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.501
Why so surprised?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.461
Well, just didn't know
he had any of those.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.256
He's been here a while and
is still a big, creepy mystery.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.091
What's his deal?

11:56.091 --> 11:58.343
Well, you probably
heard the stories.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.804
[Mimzy] He appeared
in Hell suddenly,

12:00.804 --> 12:03.932
<i>making a splash quicker
than anyone had ever seen.</i>

12:04.433 --> 12:07.769
<i>At first, people wanted
to dismiss him,</i>

12:08.103 --> 12:10.939
<i>but soon overlords
started goin' missing,</i>

12:11.273 --> 12:13.233
<i>and not small ones neither.</i>
[evil laughing]

12:13.942 --> 12:16.111
<i>We're talking heavy hitters.</i>

12:16.987 --> 12:18.947
<i>No one knew what
happened to 'em</i>

12:18.947 --> 12:23.785
<i>until these strange radio
broadcasts started going out.</i>

12:24.286 --> 12:27.956
[ominous music]
<i>All you could hear was screams.</i>

12:28.123 --> 12:30.459
<i>Every time an overlord
went missing,</i>

12:30.459 --> 12:34.129
<i>there'd be a new voice
screaming in the broadcast.</i>

12:34.963 --> 12:38.467
<i>That's when Alastor revealed
himself as the Radio Demon,</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:42.387
<i>and anyone that would mess
with him...</i> [laughs]

12:42.387 --> 12:44.473
<i>Well, let's just say</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:49.436
<i>his broadcasts never
lacked new voices.</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:53.023
<i>That's the story
most people know,</i>

12:53.815 --> 12:55.859
but underneath it all...

12:56.485 --> 12:58.195
He's a total sweetie.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.946
Put on some jazz and
pour a couple fingers of rye,

12:59.946 --> 13:01.156
and he becomes a kitten!

13:02.824 --> 13:04.159
Stop with the looks.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.369
He hasn't done any
of that in a while.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.914
Can I get another one of these?

13:09.498 --> 13:11.249
Oh, what the fuck!

13:11.249 --> 13:14.920
So, once we have the proof
that redemption is possible,

13:14.920 --> 13:19.341
this whole hotel will be full of
demons wanting to check out into Heaven.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.218
We just need
a little more time to prove it.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.428
The sharing circles haven't been
working as fast as I hoped,

13:23.428 --> 13:25.514
[Husk] Ey, Boss? Can
I have a word.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.515
[Charlie] but I'm thinking
that with a little bit more rethinking

13:26.515 --> 13:27.224
we can really get it going.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.309
What is it?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.977
You and I both know Mimzy only
shows up when she needs somethin'.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.396
That bitch is trouble,
and who knows what kinda demon

13:33.396 --> 13:35.357
she fucked with to
come running to you this time?

13:35.357 --> 13:39.194
It's nothing I can't handle.
Don't worry Husker.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.197
Who in their right
mind would cross me?

13:42.197 --> 13:46.535
I mean... you've been gone
a while and it's not like anybody knows why.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.078
They don't need to know.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.039
And don't you worry
your fuzzy head about it.

13:51.039 --> 13:55.043
[growls] You may own my soul,
but I ain't your fucking pet!

13:55.043 --> 13:57.963
Hmhm! But you are! Haha!

13:57.963 --> 14:00.966
Big talk for someone
who's also on a leash.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.261
[Alastor]
Aha, what did you say?

14:04.261 --> 14:08.014
[chain clanks]
Oh, fuck! Nothing I, um--

14:08.014 --> 14:09.266
[chokes]

14:09.266 --> 14:11.560
[Alastor]
If you ever say that again,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.145
[intense music]
I will tear your soul apart

14:14.145 --> 14:16.231
and broadcast your screams

14:16.231 --> 14:18.567
for every other disrespectful
wretch

14:18.567 --> 14:21.027
who dares to question me.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.320
- Understood.
- Lovely.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.907
[chuckles]
Good talk, my good man!

14:25.907 --> 14:28.577
Always nice to catch up.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.120
[Vaggie] And we've
almost been able to find

14:30.120 --> 14:31.413
all of Angel's drug stashes...

14:32.038 --> 14:33.623
Almost.

14:33.623 --> 14:37.627
So once that's out of the way it
should be much smoother sailing.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.589
Well, that certainly is,
uh... is-is something.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.091
So... What do you think?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.968
- About what?
- The hotel.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.597
Oh yes, it does... it does look
much better now, doesn't it?

14:48.597 --> 14:50.265
[chuckles]

14:50.265 --> 14:52.017
Ya know, but I'm thinking this
railing needs work,

14:52.017 --> 14:55.061
one good push and you'd just
go right over the edge.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.980
Whoopie, bye-bye.
[laugh]

14:56.980 --> 14:59.941
What? No, no, the plan, Dad!

14:59.941 --> 15:02.319
What do you think about
using the hotel to help sinners?

15:02.319 --> 15:03.236
Ahh.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.323
Alright,
I mean, look...

15:06.323 --> 15:08.366
I love that you want
to see the best in people,

15:08.366 --> 15:12.162
but these sinners... You know,
they're just the worst.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.624
I, I don't know how much you can
realistically expect from them in Heaven.

15:16.041 --> 15:21.171
Hohooo boy, Heaven is not
exactly as carefree as you might think.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.298
Yeah, they have rules.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.674
<i>Lots</i> of rules.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.968
And they aren't very open
minded as you'd hope.

15:26.968 --> 15:30.722
These are our people Dad,
I... I have to try.

15:30.722 --> 15:34.309
Our "people", Charlie,
are awful!

15:34.476 --> 15:37.479
They got gifted free will
and look what they did with it!

15:37.479 --> 15:38.605
Everything's terrible!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.649
[wheeze]

15:40.649 --> 15:43.318
I just don't want you to put
yourself on the line for people like--

15:43.318 --> 15:45.070
[loud thud]
Geez! What now?!

15:45.070 --> 15:46.988
[Lucifer]
Well, like that!

15:46.988 --> 15:51.034
[Loan Shark] Mimzy, we know
you're in there you lousy bitch!

15:51.034 --> 15:52.160
Oh, shit.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.329
- [Vaggie] Que carajo?!
- [Charlie] What's going on?

15:54.329 --> 15:58.333
I maaaaaaay be in
trouble with some loan shark's

15:58.333 --> 16:01.336
I may or may not have
borrowed fifty grand from-- eep!

16:01.336 --> 16:03.129
[Loan Shark] You
better come out.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.714
And I may have also
stolen a car...

16:04.714 --> 16:08.468
and crashed it... into
the loan shark's girlfriend.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.011
But that bitch had it coming!

16:10.011 --> 16:12.597
- [Vaggie screams]
- [Niffty] My windows!

16:12.597 --> 16:15.517
[Sit Pentious] Ah! We're under
seige! Ah! Take cover!

16:15.517 --> 16:17.018
[dramatic music] [Vaggie]
Look out! What the fuck?!

16:17.018 --> 16:18.645
[panicked shouting]

16:18.645 --> 16:21.439
Ya see, this is exaaactly what
I'm talking about Charlie.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.024
You build something nice,

16:23.024 --> 16:25.151
you invite people in and
offer them everything

16:25.151 --> 16:29.155
and they just bring violence
and chaos to your doorstep.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.574
It doesn't matter how
well intentioned you are,

16:31.574 --> 16:33.535
they're always going
to disappoint you.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.954
[Sir Pentious] Niffty, come
along! [rubble crashes]

16:36.246 --> 16:38.164
[Vaggie]
All of you, get a safe distance.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.541
I'll take care of this.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.710
[Alastor]
No, my dear, leave it to me.

16:42.377 --> 16:46.715
It's time I remind everyone
why I am here.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.801
[Mimzy] Oh, finally.
Took ya long enough!

16:49.801 --> 16:52.554
[Alastor]
A reminder to all,

16:52.554 --> 16:57.058
not to mess with
the Radio Demon.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.518
[evil laugh]

16:58.518 --> 17:00.145
[Loan Shark screams]

17:01.229 --> 17:02.814
[Mimzy] Yeah!

17:02.814 --> 17:06.735
[intense music] I will devour
each and every one of you!

17:06.735 --> 17:11.114
[Lucifer] Mhm, ya see?
What I tell ya?

17:11.114 --> 17:13.283
Charlie, sinners are violent
psychopaths,

17:13.283 --> 17:17.120
hell bent on causing as much
pain and destruction as they can.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.122
There's really no
point in trying.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.459
Dad, stop! He's defending
this hotel.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.544
[Charlie] It may be a bit
more sadistic than I'd hoped.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.755
But he's doing it for me!

17:26.755 --> 17:29.799
How come he can have faith in
me, but my own father can't?

17:29.799 --> 17:32.177
[Angel]
Ooh, drama.

17:32.844 --> 17:37.140
[Alastor] Oh, I missed
getting to let off steam.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.769
Oh, Alastor! What
a fantastic show.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.146
Bravo, as always.

17:43.146 --> 17:47.150
Thanks for helpin' lil' old me outta
a tough spot, you're always such a pal.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.151
[crash]

17:48.151 --> 17:49.402
Oops.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.572
Heheheh, sorry about the mess,

17:52.572 --> 17:55.784
but I'm sure the lil' bug
can take care of it for ya.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.162
I think you should go Mimzy.
Now.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.623
Oh pff, Alastor,
you're such a kidder you!

18:01.623 --> 18:03.291
Haha, you are so funny...

18:03.291 --> 18:04.626
I mean it.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.127
You deliberately brought
danger to this place

18:06.127 --> 18:07.796
just to have me clean
up your mess.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.839
I can't have that here.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.801
But you love takin' care a' me!
What?

18:12.801 --> 18:16.805
You don't actually give a shit
about this tacky place, do ya?

18:16.805 --> 18:18.681
Come on.
I know you.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.434
You heartless son of a bitch.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.563
You are welcome if you actually
want to give redemption a shot.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.234
But I think we both know
that's not really your style.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.902
So you need to leave.

18:30.902 --> 18:34.322
[splutters] Fine! Who needs ya?

18:34.322 --> 18:37.826
Have fun with ya lil'
princess and ya lil' hotel.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.619
See if I care.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.579
[Angel/Husk] [eating popcorn]

18:41.579 --> 18:43.498
[Angel]
This is really getting good.

18:43.498 --> 18:47.377
[Charlie]
Dad... just... help me.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.838
I...I can't.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.589
Why can't you?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.258
Charlie!
[gasps]

18:53.258 --> 18:54.425
You don't understand,

18:54.425 --> 18:56.761
Heaven never listens.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.180
They didn't listen to me,

18:59.180 --> 19:00.223
they won't listen to you.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.183
