WEBVTT

00:32.532 --> 00:34.075
So, is this how you avoid me?

00:36.745 --> 00:37.912
I like this dome.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.790
All this life.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.963
I didn't know what to say.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.257
Did Karl tell you?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.343
I need to hear it from you.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.223
My mother.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.518
She's alive.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.728
Alive?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.564
How?

01:04.647 --> 01:06.691
When her body was dying, she made...

01:07.734 --> 01:08.943
contingencies.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.363
She built this ship
to be her home forever.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.240
You're saying...

01:14.324 --> 01:16.201
she's been using the ship to hurt us?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.411
No. She is the ship.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.622
All of this,

01:21.456 --> 01:23.291
the metal hull, the Crystal Matrix...

01:23.374 --> 01:25.627
The Nightflyer is her body now.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.254
And that's why I'm hiding up here.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.132
To get away from her voice.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.802
You can hear your mother?

01:34.969 --> 01:35.970
Words...

01:37.430 --> 01:38.890
feelings in my head

01:39.641 --> 01:40.809
all the time.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.438
You take me away from that.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.519
Get it out of me.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.521
Daddy?

02:31.734 --> 02:32.569
That thing...

02:33.319 --> 02:34.529
Cancer inside.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.656
Cut it out.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.658
Just leave me alone.

02:39.909 --> 02:40.869
Go away.

02:40.952 --> 02:41.953
Get it out!

02:42.745 --> 02:44.038
You brought it here.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.123
Brought what here?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.292
Please, daddy. It's hurting me.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.711
Get it out. It's... it's hurting me.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.505
Just walk through it.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.220
She's taunting me.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.931
Eris's mother?

03:03.558 --> 03:06.060
You know it's an errant computer program?

03:06.769 --> 03:08.980
Yes, I... I know.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.231
Right.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.233
So, don't leave yourself so vulnerable.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.737
What exactly is it you want me to do?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.450
When you torture yourself, Karl.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.745
It makes it easy for other people
to do the same.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.268
Rowan, why is the fucking--

03:48.686 --> 03:50.104
Evening.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.482
Why is the fucking probe in my room?

03:52.565 --> 03:53.691
You tell me.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.968
No, don't touch it! Don't.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.096
No, of course not.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.350
Rowan, this should be

04:27.433 --> 04:28.601
a million miles away from us.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.813
How did you get it in here?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.231
I didn't.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.733
Then who did?

06:03.738 --> 06:04.864
-Roy?

06:04.947 --> 06:06.032
Roy, Roy, Roy.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.450
Oh, she's screaming at me.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.286
I've never heard her like this.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.410
Hey!

06:53.162 --> 06:53.996
Somebody?

07:01.462 --> 07:02.630
Open this thing!

07:12.181 --> 07:13.850
I thought you said
no more needles.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.979
Careful, you're transmitting.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.065
I'm not suppressing you.
Just checking your levels of Teke hormone.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.317
Hey!

07:27.780 --> 07:29.240
You're thinking about D'Branin again.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.826
It's none of your business.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.827
No, no, no!

07:38.499 --> 07:39.792
-Thale.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.294
-Thale. Okay.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.004
-Bring your levels down.
-I can't breathe.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
What are you sensing?

07:47.925 --> 07:49.802
Cold. I can't feel my fingers.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.306
It's freaking cold.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.225
-Okay, try to breathe.
-I can't.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.333
This is our first point of alien contact.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.460
Well, that's,
that's a bit of a leap, Karl.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.711
Oh, yeah?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.463
Now, how do you explain...

08:25.546 --> 08:27.423
how it just magically appeared in my room?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.300
I don't... I don't know.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.843
-I... I can't.
-Hmm.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.887
Rowan, I built this probe,

08:32.970 --> 08:34.722
and they sent it back to me.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.684
Surely Eris is involved.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.478
I told you they could do
incredible things.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.396
We knew they could do incredible things.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.941
Please stop there. Let's take a step back.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.817
And we'll run some tests.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.861
Yes, I'll get Lommie to port in.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.030
No, no, no. You can't send her in there.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.198
Rowan, I need you to get

08:52.281 --> 08:54.367
radiation monitors, spectrometers,
cameras everywhere.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.619
Record everything. Everything.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.371
Don't forget the duct tape.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.751
Keep your head from exploding.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.763
Sir, we're getting error codes.
A lot of them.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.016
Warning. System...

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
Isolate the malfunctioning systems.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.353
Cut them off
from the rest of the ship.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.438
Dr. Matheson, we're quite busy right now.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.940
There's been an accident.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.358
One of your crew members.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.318
...unit now

09:32.363 --> 09:35.533
Thale, he felt something.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.578
Where did it happen?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.663
I can't be sure
unless we take him out of the dome.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.666
-Warning.
-I'll gather security detail.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.918
-System compromised.
-No. Better just you and me.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.422
It would help a lot for Thale
to feel you trust him.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.179
Last night, you very specifically told me
to run the wave patterns,

09:57.263 --> 09:58.931
-so that's what I've been doing.
-Yeah.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.600
That was before.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.393
Before what?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.288
We can't let this get out, not yet.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.540
Think of the crew if they found out.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.666
Or Eris.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.922
I don't understand though.
How did it get...

10:33.132 --> 10:34.383
back on the ship?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.718
We don't know.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.096
Makes nice Beach Boys music though.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.306
Listen.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.353
Did it reach the Volcryn?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.772
We don't know.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.233
What's this, uh...

10:51.317 --> 10:52.485
this crust on the outside?

10:52.568 --> 10:55.363
Oh, that's isotopes
of iridium and palladium.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.947
It's all over the hull.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.199
It's kind of like a...

10:58.282 --> 10:59.617
like a space rust, if you will.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.827
-You touched it?
-No.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.081
Had to get a small sample.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.792
Rowan, you got to be careful.
We don't know what this shit is.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.670
There is so much data in there.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.964
I'm finally going to get some answers.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.676
What kind of answers?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.554
Well, how it got back here.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.348
For a start.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.151
-How far down?
-I'll let you know.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.364
Well, we just went past it. Go back.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.074
Cargo.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.548
Thale experiences everything.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.510
Mentally, emotionally, physically.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.594
Incredible.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.680
And not pleasant.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.558
He describes it as a suffocating dread.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.692
It's one of those.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.776
These bins are locked.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.863
It's not possible
to close them from inside.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.449
Maybe someone did it from outside.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.701
You're suggesting this wasn't an accident?

13:06.410 --> 13:07.453
We died together.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.505
Can you do something about the room?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.173
It's too hot.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.261
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.138
Well, is it... is it not working?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.265
There's nothing wrong with the controls.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.685
What do you mean? Then why are we not...

13:33.270 --> 13:34.939
What are you saying?

13:35.022 --> 13:37.233
-We think it's intentional.
-What do you mean intentional?

13:39.610 --> 13:40.486
Eris' mother.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.530
She's, uh... inside the ship.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.491
We think she's the one
turning the heat up.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.535
So that's what I felt.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.288
That's what I felt when I ported
into the system. It was her.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.415
Yeah. Yeah. That's what we think, yeah.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.295
Or more likely a simulation
based on her psychological protocols.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.717
No, it's not a simulation.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.555
She's in there, and she's real.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.104
Come on.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.564
Let's get you to bed.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.155
It ain't easy, you know.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.241
Dying over and over again.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.411
I'll get you some suppressives.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.913
I ain't going back on that shit.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.718
Do you remember when you were a little boy

14:47.219 --> 14:48.637
and you used to have your episodes?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.601
I was the only one
you'd let get close to you.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.313
Yeah, well,
I ain't a little kid no more, am I?

14:59.023 --> 15:01.233
You probably don't give a shit.
You're thinking about him.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.276
That's not fair.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.987
Karl and I used to be close.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.656
I've known him for a long time.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.786
I think about you all the time.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.415
You shouldn't lie, it doesn't suit you.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.003
Right.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.173
You should get some rest.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.966
I'll bring you your dinner
in an hour or so.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.723
-Is she still screaming?
-No.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.391
Now, she's lashing out.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.227
There's no way to predict who she'll hurt.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.313
The guy in the cargo bin,
you're sure that was her?

15:44.818 --> 15:47.071
The system controlling the bins
was interrupted last night.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.989
We didn't get a warning.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.908
It reset itself.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.789
The probe can't take this heat any longer.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.168
Commander Eris requests entry.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.421
I wouldn't do that.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.298
Karl, open up.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.512
I'm going
to override the door.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.019
Oh, my god.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.860
It's my bad.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.279
That thing.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.700
That's what she's screaming about.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.910
She wants it off her ship.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.339
-Hey
-Hi.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.384
Thanks for meeting me.
I'm only in town for a few days, the...

16:51.301 --> 16:52.219
conference.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.267
You look good, Karl.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.688
I miss you.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.108
We never really got a chance to talk.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.109
No.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.319
You left too abruptly for that.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.823
I know. I'm sorry.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.825
I just didn't know what to say.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.286
You can't just...

17:18.495 --> 17:23.167
show up out of the blue
after two years without contact.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.752
Well, I wanted to see you.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.087
To talk about what happened.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.716
Okay. So, let's talk.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.803
Well, it's complicated.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.096
Um...

17:40.184 --> 17:41.643
Okay, so I'll talk.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.981
So, after you bailed on me, I, uh...

17:46.648 --> 17:47.775
met someone else.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.611
Her name is Joy and...

17:51.695 --> 17:53.030
we're getting married this summer.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.240
Wow.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.161
That's... that's really great, Karl.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.829
I guess I'm getting older because, uh...

18:01.497 --> 18:02.873
sold my motorcycle,

18:02.956 --> 18:05.709
got a house in Ross,
and talking about having kids.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.925
I'm really happy for you.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.469
Can you imagine

18:16.261 --> 18:17.346
me being a father?

18:20.474 --> 18:21.642
You'll be a great father.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.854
That means a lot.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.114
Yes, sir. What can I do?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.032
Send a welding team
to Karl D'Branin's quarters.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.867
There's some equipment here
we need to remove.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.536
No, no, no!
I'm not gonna let you do this.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.871
I'm not asking your permission. No this is my probe.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.915
-It's too important!
-I'm trying to save your life!

18:44.998 --> 18:47.376
My mother can feel this thing
inside of her, like a cancer.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.338
I don't know if it's something
the Volcryn did, but she wants it out.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.216
You feel sorry for her.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.635
Roy, you have to stand up to her.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.720
This is your chance.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.305
We'll do whatever it takes to help you.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.057
-It's not that simple, Melantha.
-No, okay.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.684
Roy, it is that simple.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.563
I know how important
this mission is to you.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.692
And I know you are not gonna destroy
the only alien artifact

19:11.775 --> 19:13.861
that anybody has ever come in contact with

19:13.944 --> 19:15.821
because you're afraid
of pissing off your mother.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.115
What she's doing with your cabin,
the heat.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.203
She'll do this to the entire ship,
or worse.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.497
Just give me the time to get the data
I need off my probe.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.458
Please. Please.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.171
One cycle.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.755
I can hold her off for one cycle.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.632
Then I'm cutting up that probe

19:35.716 --> 19:37.718
-and sending it out the airlock.
-That's all I need.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.011
-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.274
Oh, yeah. You took that well.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.069
Maybe you should take a minute
to clear your head.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.823
We don't want to be making any mistakes,
given we're now being rushed.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.410
Okay.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.589
Can't sleep?

20:15.672 --> 20:17.341
No, I'm worried about Thale.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.094
He experienced a dock worker's death,
and he's taking it pretty badly.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.514
I'm just... I don't want him
to start slipping.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.437
Sorry, I know how you feel
about telepaths.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.355
What do you mean?

20:31.438 --> 20:32.940
Oh, well I work with L-1s.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.026
I know that's what drove us apart.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.820
When I took the job at Sutherland,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.948
I knew how you felt.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.200
No. Hey, I was scared.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.409
I wasn't the only one.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.329
We've all seen
what Ls can do on those vids.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.206
Telepaths are misunderstood.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.459
I took the job
to help people to understand

20:52.542 --> 20:54.378
that there's a place
for everyone in this world.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.713
Agatha, that's all
very honorable and obviously,

20:56.797 --> 20:59.174
I'm all for the idea
of using Ls for their abilities,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.718
but, but I don't want
to have my thoughts invaded.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.845
Wait, you think they want
to see inside your head?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.640
-It's a curse.
-Okay, malicious or not,

21:06.723 --> 21:08.016
it's still an invasion.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.726
I mean, okay, they can't control it but...

21:13.981 --> 21:15.065
What?

21:16.316 --> 21:19.403
I just remembered how you can be when...

21:19.778 --> 21:20.612
Yeah.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.830
You really need to see this.

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
Hi.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.835
-Now.
-Yeah.

21:34.918 --> 21:35.961
Yeah.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.559
Phew.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.520
You may wish to remove
a layer or two of clothing.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.689
Cynthia Eris is doing this.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.691
She thinks the heat will damage the probe.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.568
Won't this heat warp the circuits?

21:59.651 --> 22:02.321
No, it should be fine.
It was designed for deep space.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.405
Now, look at this.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.743
That's blood.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.203
-Where is it coming from?
-That's a good question.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.288
Follow me.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.964
I was removing the internal drive tray...

22:21.048 --> 22:22.674
And what

22:24.926 --> 22:28.013
I think it makes perfect sense.

22:28.847 --> 22:29.806
Because

22:31.892 --> 22:33.268
it's alive.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.032
Okay, Mother, it's going to be okay.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.745
Please, just, just try
and get some rest.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.831
Oh, no. Stop it.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.041
Mother stop it!

22:56.750 --> 22:58.085
Stop it!

23:04.841 --> 23:06.259
Was that her?

23:11.556 --> 23:13.058
I used to hear her clearly.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.728
Now, there's so many voices fighting.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.439
Fighting for attention.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.651
Terrified.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.152
How do you know it's her?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.487
What do you mean?

23:26.321 --> 23:28.156
-Maybe those voices...
-I'm not crazy, Mel.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.325
But they could just be echoes
of your mother.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.661
Not the person that she was
when she was alive.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.579
Cynthia Eris is a memory to the world.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.039
She's using you.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.999
But up here, on the Nightflyer...

23:39.918 --> 23:41.294
she never went away.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.796
Don't be a fool.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.883
My whole life, I've heard her.

23:47.717 --> 23:48.885
Her voice...

23:50.720 --> 23:52.264
her criticisms...

23:53.473 --> 23:55.934
Every judgment coming
from inside of these walls and--

23:57.269 --> 23:59.771
I'm sorry, Roy.
But maybe it's not the probe

23:59.855 --> 24:01.231
that you need to try to get rid of?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.276
Maybe you...

24:04.359 --> 24:05.694
What?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.071
She told me you'd say that.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.974
Die.

26:19.911 --> 26:20.787
Fuck.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.959
Ah... Central components intact.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.335
Can it sustain this heat?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.046
For the time being.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.134
But it's not enjoying it very much.

26:35.802 --> 26:36.678
Okay.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.974
All this organic material.
What if...

26:42.934 --> 26:45.478
Could this actually be the Volcryn?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.231
Or is it some sort of message?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.277
You're certainly enjoying this.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.154
Of course, aren't you? I mean...

26:54.237 --> 26:56.614
you came all the way out here
to find some form of alien life.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.741
Look what came back!

26:57.824 --> 27:00.327
It certainly is quite incredible.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.788
Okay, so we know
that they can move through the walls,

27:03.872 --> 27:05.498
which means that they can...

27:07.876 --> 27:09.252
Say it out loud.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.629
The Volcryn may have the ability
to control space-time.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.506
Right? They...

27:13.590 --> 27:17.218
They sent this here for a reason to us.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.762
Well, we don't know that, now.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.638
We could send Lommie in.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.724
Lommie, you could go in
and extract some information.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.602
-Too dangerous. We don't know what...
-No, it's fine. I want to do it.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.857
Who knows how long it will survive?

27:32.567 --> 27:35.111
Her system isn't designed
to go into things like that.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.696
Well, then we fucking lose everything.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.740
The heat is going to destroy
all of the data.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.033
She has to go inside.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.285
I suppose it is conceivable...

27:43.078 --> 27:45.789
that they're using organic material

27:45.872 --> 27:49.501
rather than words or sounds.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.880
Perhaps this tissue is their language.

27:53.963 --> 27:56.299
You see. See what you just did there?

27:56.383 --> 27:57.217
What?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.386
You admitted that this could be
the Volcryn, and it is.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.679
No, that's...
that's not what I did at all.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.098
Actually, it is.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.265
I said conceivable.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.768
What's that?

28:06.851 --> 28:09.354
That is the analysis
of the probe blood sample.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.737
What the hell?

28:18.238 --> 28:19.864
That's not possible.

28:19.948 --> 28:23.076
The blood
coming out of the probe, it's...

28:23.159 --> 28:24.202
you.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.043
Apparently, the Volcryn know who you are.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.674
No...

28:38.133 --> 28:39.509
Then...

28:39.592 --> 28:40.593
Does that mean...

28:40.677 --> 28:43.805
Does that... does that mean
that this is me?

28:43.888 --> 28:44.973
All right, I'm in charge.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.268
We follow my lead,
my orders from here on out.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.687
-No. No, fucking way.
-Yes, fucking way.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.397
No, no, no. This is my probe.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.232
I built it. I sent it out there.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.359
Technically, Karl, I sent it out,

28:56.443 --> 28:59.320
so I'm sorry, but you can no longer
study the phenomenon

28:59.904 --> 29:02.407
because you are the phenomenon.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.081
I can't, there's too many at once.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.375
Roy!

29:12.459 --> 29:14.753
-No.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.212
No, no, no.

29:16.963 --> 29:17.964
That's not true.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.468
You don't get to decide. I get to decide.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.762
I'm in control.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.721
Mother?

29:27.098 --> 29:27.932
Mother?

29:28.016 --> 29:29.684
End this mission.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.313
Mother.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.200
Get it out. Now!

29:45.283 --> 29:47.660
Now. Now.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.578
No.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.079
No. No.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.206
Karl!

29:52.832 --> 29:54.459
You see that, right?

29:56.586 --> 29:58.963
-I see how you think of me.
-I see how you think of me.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.466
-How you hate who I am.
-How you hate who I am.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.551
Hate you? No, I don't hate you.
We talked about that.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.761
-You would.
-You would.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.930
-If I told you how I knew...
-If I told you how I knew.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.224
-Agatha, stop. You're scaring me.
-Don't be scared.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.642
Don't be scared.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.685
-It's so beautiful.
-It's so beautiful.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.147
Look.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.026
What we could have had.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.612
I found out after I left you.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.740
We could have had a child together.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.450
You and me.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.661
This child.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.330
But I knew how you felt.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.500
That there was no future for us.

30:35.583 --> 30:36.501
Kill.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.753
-I was in a new city.
-Kill.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.255
-Alone.
-Kill.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.881
-Surrounded by strangers...
-No.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.341
-Kill.
-No hope.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.009
-Agatha, stop.
-Kill.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.094
-Stop.
-So...

30:46.177 --> 30:47.220
-Kill.
-I cut it out.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.304
Death.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.431
No!

31:36.144 --> 31:38.021
Joy, hey. It's me.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.066
We are so far into the void.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.111
I have no idea when this message
is actually going to reach you, so...

31:47.739 --> 31:51.409
I've been thinking about your therapy

31:51.492 --> 31:52.493
and I know that you know

31:52.577 --> 31:55.455
that I wasn't exactly
in love with the idea.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.419
And I don't want to forget about Skye.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.465
I don't think I can.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.508
And I'm not going to.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.222
But I know
that I remind you of her.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.975
And...

32:18.686 --> 32:21.064
I want you to know that...

32:23.024 --> 32:25.193
if you want to start
releasing your memories of me,

32:26.903 --> 32:28.529
then I understand.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.614
So,

32:34.869 --> 32:35.954
go ahead.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.251
Release me and start over.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.921
Because I want you to be happy.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.340
Okay.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.700
Lommie, do you do that?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.289
Shit.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.296
No, no!

33:27.922 --> 33:29.549
Don't cut the link, not while she's under.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.775
It's dying.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.570
No!

33:51.654 --> 33:53.114
Oh, shit!

33:53.990 --> 33:55.700
It's in irreversible descent.

33:55.783 --> 33:56.617
Full system collapse.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.535
Shit.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.537
Come on, we need more samples.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.331
We need everything we can get.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.556
What is it, Karl?

34:18.639 --> 34:22.351
Something Cynthia Eris showed me,

34:22.435 --> 34:23.561
taunted me with.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.232
-Was it Skye again?
-Yup.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.400
And it was you.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.116
The memory I accessed.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.410
She was able to see it.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.999
-But, yeah...
-Was it true?

34:46.209 --> 34:47.710
Were you, were you actually...

34:54.634 --> 34:56.177
I found out...

34:56.260 --> 34:58.721
when I was going through
medical clearance for Sutherland.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.354
Why didn't you, um...

35:07.772 --> 35:08.898
Why didn't you just call me?

35:12.610 --> 35:14.779
-I knew it wouldn't work.
-How?

35:14.862 --> 35:17.281
How could you know? Tell me how you knew.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.286
It was too dangerous
to keep going in there

35:22.370 --> 35:23.412
with a life inside me.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.456
I had to make a choice.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.963
I tried to put it out
of my mind for a while but,

35:32.547 --> 35:34.090
that's the thing about working with Ls,

35:36.008 --> 35:38.928
you can't bring your baggage
into the room.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.556
So, I took some time

35:43.641 --> 35:45.059
and I tried to find you,

35:45.685 --> 35:46.811
to tell you what happened.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.857
There was no conference.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.989
And when I saw how happy you were

35:59.866 --> 36:01.576
when you told me about Joy,

36:01.659 --> 36:03.494
-I just... I couldn't.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.704
Oh, Jesus.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.126
I'm sorry.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.045
I'm sorry.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.884
We can't let Cynthia Eris
tear us all apart.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.542
Anything salvaged from the probe?

36:55.671 --> 36:56.797
Why do you care?

36:56.881 --> 36:58.799
I put everything on the line
for this mission.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.345
And if there's some way for us to learn

37:02.428 --> 37:03.471
about them...

37:04.680 --> 37:06.182
Maybe she saved us?

37:10.144 --> 37:12.188
She's not going to stop at the probe.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.399
You must know that.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.081
Hey.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.999
How are you feeling?

37:33.292 --> 37:34.669
You got out of there just in time.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.839
How are you?

37:40.007 --> 37:41.259
Hm.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.260
Okay.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.222
So, what did you see
when you were inside that thing?

37:47.348 --> 37:49.141
Everything was jumbled.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.602
-The data?
-Chaos.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.772
But beautiful.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.858
Organized in a way I've never seen.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.318
Okay, so.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.530
I mean, there must have been
something in there, right?

38:02.613 --> 38:04.824
A message from the Volcryn?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.994
You're so used to looking for details

38:08.077 --> 38:09.912
that you can't see
what's right in front of you.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.291
The probe. The probe was the message.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.461
You sent them something you made.
A piece of you.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.089
And then they sent it back,

38:21.173 --> 38:22.383
but with more of you in it.

38:23.759 --> 38:24.927
That's a response.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.141
Right, well, we have to keep
studying the pieces...

38:30.224 --> 38:31.100
Karl?

38:31.767 --> 38:32.935
There's one more thing.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.354
The timestamp on the sensors,

38:35.813 --> 38:37.106
it was from a month ago.

38:37.189 --> 38:40.943
But the sensors recorded far more
than a month's worth of data.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.738
More than they could store,

38:43.821 --> 38:47.533
just data over previous data,
layer over layer.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.289
How much?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.250
According to the drives on that probe,

38:57.585 --> 39:00.629
it's been out there
for over a thousand years.
