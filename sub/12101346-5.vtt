01:06.316 --> 01:08.026
Can I help you, sir?

01:08.110 --> 01:09.444
Did you leave something behind?

01:09.528 --> 01:10.904
No, no.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.073
I didn't leave anything behind.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
I just got here.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.996
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.207
We open again at night.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.586
Say...

01:25.669 --> 01:26.837
can I ask you something?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.089
Can you look up?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.092
Just for a second?

01:37.890 --> 01:40.017
It's okay. It's okay.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.728
It won't have time to hurt.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.897
Good, good, Jorge.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.357
You're doing very good.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.986
Just let it go.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.238
Let it go.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.450
It's okay.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.537
Just let it go.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.498
Nothing to be afraid of.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.084
You did good.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.921
Hey, come on.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.174
-Is this it?
-This is it. Come on. Let's go.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.718
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.512
Gracias.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.061
Gracias.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.164
Come on.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.439
You done? Come on. Let's go. Finish up.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.776
Hey, what are you doing?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.949
-So we go this way?
-Come on.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.452
Gracias.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.204
We're kinda close. Charlie.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.040
-Come on.
-Gracias.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.667
Gracias. Buenas noches.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.545
You have tacos?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.843
-Okay, we go this way.
-Careful, careful, careful.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.390
Everyone here's a 19-year-old backpacker.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.226
We're like mastodons stomping around.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.729
We're visible from space.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.148
I think it's pretty cool.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.443
Excuse me? I don't even know
how to answer that. I'm unequipped.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.778
Do you know what cool means?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.406
Yes, I know what cool means.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.742
Not if it means Neil Young, you don't.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.162
Neil Young is cool.

06:10.245 --> 06:14.708
Dad, Neil Young sings like someone's
squeezing an old man's ball sack.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.297
One of these days
I'm gonna meet Neil Young,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.382
and I'm gonna tell him you said that.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.510
-And you know what he's gonna say?
-What?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.138
Something cool.

06:29.973 --> 06:30.974
Okay.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.396
Okay, come-- come on, guys. Come on.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.858
Come on. Come on.
It's time for bed. Let's go.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.443
Are you insane? We just got here.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.153
And you know what, we're tired.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.030
I'm not t--

06:45.113 --> 06:46.865
-I'm not tired.
-Well, I'm tired.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.159
Go to bed. Come on.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.829
Hey, hey. Stop it.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.706
I know you wanna goof around.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.417
We gotta keep a low profile
so no one finds us.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.797
You mean her?

07:01.880 --> 07:06.635
No, no, no. Not her.
She's behind us, all right?

07:09.972 --> 07:10.973
Look...

07:12.516 --> 07:14.768
while we're here,
we gotta sit tight, all right?

07:15.519 --> 07:17.229
Can't talk to anybody. Do you understand?

07:17.312 --> 07:20.107
Okay, except there's, like,
eight million people out there.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.441
Nine million.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.861
-I think it's eight.
-No, it's-- it's more like nine.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
-Eight.
-All right. All right.

07:25.028 --> 07:25.863
Nine.

07:25.946 --> 07:30.909
-Either way, who's gonna find us?
-Nobody. Nobody's gonna find us.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.621
Tomorrow I'm gonna go see some people.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.458
And they're gonna help me
find my friend, Isela.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.712
You, in particular, are gonna like Isela.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.298
So where is she?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.592
I don't know. Or not exactly.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.302
How come?

07:49.553 --> 07:53.515
A long time ago,
she got into a lot of trouble.

07:55.184 --> 07:59.146
She got involved in destroying crops,
GM's. Genetically modified crops.

07:59.229 --> 08:04.359
So she went on the run. And now
she lives in the most beautiful place.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.197
And she's gonna let us live there.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.033
Like a place on the beach?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.868
I don't know about a beach, but...

08:12.951 --> 08:16.496
if not a beach,
it's gonna be a whole lot better.

08:17.581 --> 08:18.707
Promise.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.923
Residencia Lee.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.758
With whom do I speak?

09:09.842 --> 09:11.385
Bill, I hope you're not too busy?

09:11.468 --> 09:12.469
No, no.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.762
Not at all.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.139
Just doing a little work
on The Glass Sandwich.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.558
That's jim-dandy.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.017
How is it coming along?

09:19.518 --> 09:20.519
Well...

09:21.603 --> 09:23.981
I've reached my daddy's death, so...

09:24.523 --> 09:26.233
Well, I hate to obtrude.

09:28.652 --> 09:29.903
Not at all.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.322
It's always a pleasure.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.782
Who do you have for me?

09:33.866 --> 09:35.075
Well, I have four of them.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.035
Four.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.414
-Oh.
-Oh.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.625
You look great.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.046
Like Grace Kelly.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.716
You look like Mickey Rourke.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.302
Which movie?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.351
You sure Calaca's even here?

10:44.186 --> 10:46.772
As sure as I can be
without seeing him face-to-face.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.065
And if they're not?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.400
They are. They're here.

10:51.777 --> 10:52.986
I wanna come with you.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.655
You can't.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.158
We need you to steal us some money.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.911
We need money.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.164
Well, yeah, we can do that
together, right? Later?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.041
Except what happens if I die?

11:06.124 --> 11:09.503
Who's gonna plan my memorial service?
I'm not trusting the kids to do that.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.547
That's not funny.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.215
It's kind of funny.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.133
Look at my face.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.426
Is it laughing?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.104
-Think anyone would come?
-To what?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.481
My memorial service.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.150
You don't know anybody.
Who the hell is gonna come?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.027
If I did, do you think anyone would come?

11:34.111 --> 11:35.612
Oh, so if you had hypothetical friends,

11:35.696 --> 11:38.740
do you think hypothetically they'd come
to your hypothetical memorial service?

11:38.824 --> 11:41.785
-Yeah. That's the question I'm asking.
-Sure. Why not?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.705
Would you cater it?

11:46.790 --> 11:47.791
Come on.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.711
I'm a little nervous.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.630
Okay?

11:53.714 --> 11:54.882
Yeah.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.342
They know about you,
but they don't know you.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.636
Well, you don't know them.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.388
They're friends.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.807
Whom you've never met,
only interacted with.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.351
You make it sound so filthy.

12:08.645 --> 12:12.274
It's easy.
Calaca tells us where to find Isela,

12:12.357 --> 12:14.943
and then, you know,
we have a minute to regroup.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.361
Take our time.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.197
Figure out what's happening next.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.320
Coming with, huh?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.114
Coming with.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.642
Cola, please. Room temperature.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.603
Warm as it comes.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.313
No ice.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.622
I'm hungry.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.292
Mom and Dad said they want us
to stay in the room until they get back.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.922
Left us again.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.221
Great.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.226
So, what are we supposed to do?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.855
-Don't know.
-Stay in?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.774
"Don't go out or talk to anyone."

15:40.858 --> 15:43.068
Ask no questions. Do what they say.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.070
Always.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.698
Well, I'm hungry right now.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.620
Do you think there's, like, a restaurant
or something? Like a Denny's?

15:54.288 --> 15:56.373
Like you've even ate at a Denny's.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.208
So what? Neither have you.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.419
Sure.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.713
Yeah.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.797
When?

16:05.591 --> 16:06.592
All the time.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.095
Yeah. With, you know, with Josh and stuff.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.221
Josh.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.058
You seriously never been there?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.978
No. When would I have gone?

16:20.063 --> 16:22.733
I don't know. When do you do anything?

16:26.695 --> 16:30.866
Well, if I don't eat,
I'm literally gonna die, so...

16:32.326 --> 16:34.786
Maybe you should go to the restaurant.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.916
See if you can steal someone's
leftovers or something, like rolls.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.420
Okay. You coming?

16:44.046 --> 16:45.923
No, no, you go. I'm good.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.217
You sure?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.135
Yes. Jesus. Go.

16:59.811 --> 17:03.315
Fuck it. If you won't tell me
what you did, I'll find out myself.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.484
I'm gonna go.

18:14.803 --> 18:18.807
-Hey.
-Hey. You took your time.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.475
Yeah, no kidding.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.103
Guy wanted a fortune for this thing.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.730
So, what, you haggled?

18:26.190 --> 18:27.316
Of course I haggled.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.359
-You don't haggle, you-- you stand out.
-Oh, my God.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.445
When you haggle too much,
you get remembered.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.989
You don't haggle enough...

18:35.866 --> 18:37.409
you have no money for coffee.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.663
And I've been dreaming about a coffee.
You want one?

18:41.747 --> 18:42.998
I'd love one.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.961
Where'd you eat last night?

20:53.629 --> 20:56.548
Japanese place. Near the hotel.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.343
Any good?

21:00.552 --> 21:02.262
According to what metric?

21:03.263 --> 21:05.140
The "did it taste good?" metric.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.601
I hate Japanese food.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.940
But it fit
the "closest place to eat" metric.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.442
What about you?

21:17.236 --> 21:18.278
Irish place.

21:20.489 --> 21:21.949
Irish place.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.953
-You mean the bar?
-They serve food.

21:26.036 --> 21:29.831
We got a hit.
From the digital buoy. The article.

21:31.416 --> 21:34.419
Outstanding. Where is she?

21:34.503 --> 21:37.506
Oh, yeah. Right. Mexico City.

21:38.507 --> 21:39.925
Get the jet fueled up.

21:41.051 --> 21:45.389
And find my Dramamine,
or we're all gonna be sorry.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.355
Yes.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.446
Do you like chocolate?

23:27.157 --> 23:31.411
Oh, sorry.
You don't speak English?

23:32.871 --> 23:33.872
Do you?

23:34.498 --> 23:37.376
-Yeah. I'm-- I'm American.
-Okay.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.794
Exactement.

23:40.629 --> 23:41.880
Oh, wait.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.051
Sorry.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.055
-This one?
-Yes.

23:59.273 --> 24:00.274
Ta-da.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.360
Okay. Thanks...

24:06.989 --> 24:10.033
That was unnecessary.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.786
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-J'ai de l'argent.

24:12.870 --> 24:16.123
-It was--
-I have-- I have money to buy.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.208
Sorry. Yeah, it was stupid.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.551
May I also have some chips?

24:45.319 --> 24:48.363
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What?

24:48.447 --> 24:49.448
Smile.

25:16.642 --> 25:18.268
-Keep an eye out.
-Okay.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.540
You keep watching that pot,
it's not gonna boil.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.167
It's been ten years.

25:42.918 --> 25:44.336
So what are they doing?

25:45.712 --> 25:47.714
Reprimanding us for being tardy?

25:49.550 --> 25:51.593
They got the message.
You know that, right?

25:53.470 --> 25:55.305
-Got the message.
-Yeah.

25:55.389 --> 25:56.598
Be one thing if--

26:10.737 --> 26:12.781
What? Doesn't make any sense.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.952
-What is this shit?
-What shit?

26:17.035 --> 26:19.121
-It's coordinates.
-To where?

26:19.204 --> 26:20.205
Hey.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.254
Fifteen minutes.

26:28.881 --> 26:29.882
Can we even do that?

26:31.800 --> 26:35.345
Well, it's what they need us to do
and where they need us to go.

26:35.429 --> 26:36.638
We've got no choice.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.098
No, no, no.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.725
Point is they don't need anything.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.019
They can't need it.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.439
They're just doing that to us
because they can.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.066
So what am I? Just a-- a trained seal?

26:49.443 --> 26:53.363
Listen, you're a guy
who has to swallow his pride

26:53.447 --> 26:58.118
and be where they need you to be
in a bit less than 15 minutes,

26:58.202 --> 27:00.787
or else you're a guy who has to
come up with a whole new plan.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.956
Well, I don't have another plan.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.834
I'd like another plan. You have a plan?

27:06.460 --> 27:08.670
We did my plan. You remember that?

27:08.754 --> 27:12.424
Yeah, you remember that.
We stayed at home under the radar,

27:12.508 --> 27:14.218
but they still found us, Allie.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.930
Because you know what, it turns out
they don't forget. They keep looking.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.807
All right, fuck it. Let's spitball.

27:20.891 --> 27:23.477
We'll just get out the whiteboard
and Sharpie, right?

27:24.311 --> 27:25.646
No such thing as a bad idea.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.065
We got nothing.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.817
We got nowhere else to go.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.237
Jesus.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.573
I could rob a casino. I could do that.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.076
Go anywhere we want in the world.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.078
I'll bet you I can rob a casino.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.497
Yeah, I bet you could. Let's go.

27:48.669 --> 27:49.795
Fuck.

27:57.094 --> 27:58.095
Charlie?

28:00.347 --> 28:01.348
Charlie?

28:31.336 --> 28:34.214
I mean, like, the English guy.
He dropped some E on the beach.

28:34.298 --> 28:38.177
No, don't. He doesn't know
what ecstasy is.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.470
He found it.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.557
-We can't corrupt him.
-Hey.

28:44.266 --> 28:45.475
Hey. I've been--

28:45.559 --> 28:46.643
-Oh.
-Hi.

28:46.727 --> 28:49.438
Hey, sis.
This is, like, my sister or whatever.

28:49.521 --> 28:50.522
-Hey.
-Ciao.

28:50.606 --> 28:51.940
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:52.024 --> 28:53.525
Beer? Have a seat.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.611
-Beer?
-Do you wanna sit down?

28:56.904 --> 29:00.407
Can I-- Can I-- Hey, can I--
Can I talk to you for a minute?

29:00.490 --> 29:03.535
I don't even-- That's so disgusting.
Wait, pass me that.

29:03.619 --> 29:04.828
Now?

29:05.454 --> 29:07.706
-Yeah. Yeah, now.
-What? What do you need to tell me?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.458
Like a human Froyo.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.462
-This is fun.
-What is your problem?

29:13.545 --> 29:15.881
-I just need--
-What is your problem? Can you relax?

29:15.964 --> 29:17.341
Can we go to the room or something?

29:17.424 --> 29:19.009
-I need to tell you something.
-Why?

29:19.551 --> 29:21.512
-Charlie's sister, have a beer.
-I just--

29:22.721 --> 29:25.057
-You got another one?
-Don't listen to those assholes.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.268
-How you feeling, man?
-It's just one beer.

29:28.352 --> 29:30.812
-Yeah, like, I feel like I'm blushing.
-I'm sorry, these guys are complete nuts.

29:30.896 --> 29:33.440
-Yeah. Wow.
-Don't listen to anything they say.

29:37.486 --> 29:38.487
Margot.

29:39.530 --> 29:40.531
Margot.

29:41.198 --> 29:42.199
Come here.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.660
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

29:45.369 --> 29:48.914
I know. But it is what it is. Okay?

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
Fuck.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.136
It was a great time, really.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.931
-And the owner opens the door...
-So you guys know each other?

30:06.014 --> 30:08.308
Yeah, we-- we met up down in Lima.

30:09.351 --> 30:11.603
Lima? Cool.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.940
What about you? Where are you from?

30:15.023 --> 30:18.569
I'm from-- I'm from Stockton.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.238
I'm really sorry.
I don't know where that is.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.407
-It's okay. It's okay. It's in California.
-Great.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.660
Oh, my God.
Guys, she's from California, Stockton.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.120
-Stockton?
-Yeah.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.622
-Is that a disease?
-No, it's--

30:30.706 --> 30:34.334
You know, we-- we talked about
doing America, but then...

30:34.418 --> 30:36.837
you know, we thought about it, and...

30:36.920 --> 30:39.089
Not for us.

30:39.715 --> 30:40.716
No, no, no.

30:42.134 --> 30:45.095
MasculinitÃ© toxique. No? Incels.

30:47.222 --> 30:50.142
Jesus. Elvis.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.519
Coca-Cola.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.566
It's like you can't even buy a Kinder
Surprise Egg 'cause they're illegal.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.318
They're too dangerous.

30:59.401 --> 31:03.238
The little teeny-tiny
plastic toy might choke someone.

31:03.322 --> 31:08.202
But you can basically go to a fast food
and order a gun with your hot wings.

31:10.829 --> 31:11.955
This is it.

31:13.123 --> 31:14.166
How long?

31:15.334 --> 31:16.335
Two minutes.

31:17.544 --> 31:20.214
Two. Do you even know
who we're looking for?

31:21.381 --> 31:22.382
No.

31:32.684 --> 31:33.685
Yeah.

31:38.857 --> 31:39.858
Allie?

31:41.652 --> 31:42.903
Allie!

31:44.029 --> 31:45.197
Allie.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.574
Allie!

31:49.535 --> 31:50.953
Gr-gracias.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.372
-Hello?
-Who are you?

31:53.455 --> 31:56.708
You know who this it. It's Allie.
You know me.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.044
Allie disappeared ten years ago.

31:59.837 --> 32:02.047
No, that's not-- It's not what you--

32:02.923 --> 32:04.716
Nobody disappeared. We just--

32:05.384 --> 32:08.220
We just thought we'd try and make it work
in the States, that's all.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.598
Is this-- Is this Calaca?

32:14.893 --> 32:17.062
You know me. You don't need to do this.

32:17.688 --> 32:18.772
Are you alone?

32:18.856 --> 32:20.107
Yes.

32:20.190 --> 32:23.652
I mean, no, I'm-- Well,
I'm with Margot, my wife, and the kids.

32:24.194 --> 32:26.488
You know about them.
They were all part of the deal.

32:29.575 --> 32:30.576
Hello?

32:31.952 --> 32:32.953
Hello?

32:34.830 --> 32:36.206
Fucking asshole.

32:50.345 --> 32:51.346
Come on, let's go.

33:01.648 --> 33:02.900
Shit, wait.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.738
Fuck. They were making sure
we don't have a tail.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.364
Security protocol.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.909
Security protocols, my ass.

33:13.285 --> 33:15.037
Passive-aggressive fuckery.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.122
It's a mentality
I do not understand at all.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.373
Shit.

33:39.186 --> 33:40.395
Let me just--

33:41.772 --> 33:44.441
So-- So what are you gonna do
when you get home?

33:44.525 --> 33:48.820
I mean, God knows.
I've got an offer from Cambridge. PPE.

33:50.531 --> 33:52.574
-PP--
-E.

33:53.325 --> 33:55.285
You know, philosophy, politics
and economics?

33:55.369 --> 33:57.329
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Of course. PPE.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.331
It's kinda like a big thing.

33:59.414 --> 34:03.544
But actually, you know, I think I'll take
the offer from NYU. International law.

34:03.627 --> 34:06.296
Because what I'd really like to do
is run an NGO

34:06.380 --> 34:09.800
or maybe organize microloans
for women-run businesses.

34:10.425 --> 34:11.760
Wow, that's awesome.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.847
I just feel like it'd be really great to
give something back, you know?

34:15.681 --> 34:16.681
Yeah.

34:18.308 --> 34:19.309
Wait.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.395
Stop hogging it. Give it.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.731
Hey. You got it. Go.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.197
-That was a big one.
-What about you?

34:33.282 --> 34:35.284
Oh, it's all good.

34:37.870 --> 34:38.954
I don't really...

34:41.123 --> 34:43.625
I-- Actually, I got into Columbia.

34:43.708 --> 34:44.710
Yeah.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.503
I was, like, wait-listed at first, but--

34:46.587 --> 34:47.920
That's so cool!

34:48.005 --> 34:49.547
Guys, she got into Columbia.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.632
-That's great.
-Yeah.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.426
-That's good.
-That is so cool.

34:53.677 --> 34:57.181
-We could hang out in New York together.
-Exactly. Exactly, yeah.

35:16.283 --> 35:17.284
Bingo.

35:17.367 --> 35:18.702
Open.

35:20.871 --> 35:22.289
Where'd you see 'em?

35:27.211 --> 35:28.212
Get in.

35:37.846 --> 35:41.350
And yet America has no culture,
no sense of irony.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.477
Oh, they think it's better
than anywhere else in the world,

35:43.560 --> 35:46.772
and if you don't agree with them,
you basically get invaded.

35:48.273 --> 35:50.108
I mean, why all the flags?

35:52.027 --> 35:54.154
There are flags everywhere.

35:54.238 --> 35:55.948
It's crazy land. It's crazy land.

35:56.031 --> 36:00.160
Take a look at the big fat motherfuckers.

36:00.244 --> 36:01.870
Oh, my God.

36:01.954 --> 36:04.873
Waddling around the mall like elephants.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.917
Americans think they own the world.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.880
They're bullies stomping around
in their socks and sandals.

36:12.631 --> 36:13.632
Jesus.

36:14.383 --> 36:17.511
The Crocs and the-- the baseball caps.

36:19.054 --> 36:22.099
Wait, wait. God and money, right?

36:22.182 --> 36:23.433
Yeah.

36:23.517 --> 36:24.518
Money first.

36:25.644 --> 36:27.729
-Here, Charlie, have some more.
-So American.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.356
Charlie.

36:29.439 --> 36:31.400
-Charlie, you don't want that.
-What?

36:31.483 --> 36:34.111
-Give it back.
-Charlie's sister owns Charlie.

36:34.194 --> 36:35.654
Tell you what to do.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.948
-Does Charlie's sister own Charlie?
-Listen to your sister.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.408
It's totally fine.

36:39.491 --> 36:42.035
-It's okay. It's fine.
-Telling you what to do.

36:42.119 --> 36:44.204
You need to calm down. It's fine.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.666
You know,
there was this time where we were--

36:47.749 --> 36:49.835
we were, like, in a desert.

36:49.918 --> 36:53.005
-There were, like, bodies everywhere.
-Bodies? What?

36:53.088 --> 36:54.381
-It was crazy, like--
-Charlie.

36:54.464 --> 36:56.091
-like mummies, kind of.
-What?

36:56.175 --> 36:57.593
I think he's really high.

36:59.303 --> 37:04.933
We-- We knew this guy, Chuy.
He was-- He was a coyote.

37:05.017 --> 37:07.311
-Chuy, the coyote?
-He was--

37:08.979 --> 37:11.315
-Is it your cat?
-No.

37:11.398 --> 37:12.733
Is he your brother?

37:12.816 --> 37:16.820
He was taking us through the smuggling
route that was like a bombing range.

37:16.904 --> 37:19.865
There were just bombs, like,
everywhere just lying around.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.366
Oh, I think I've been there.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.912
Your brother is hilarious.

37:24.995 --> 37:27.664
-That was a good one.
-We saw someone get shot too.

37:27.748 --> 37:29.166
I hate when people just get shot.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.421
Oh, my God.

37:34.505 --> 37:36.215
You guys are such dicks.

37:36.298 --> 37:37.299
It's okay.

37:37.382 --> 37:40.385
No, you guys, I don't even--
Have you ever even seen anyone get shot?

37:40.469 --> 37:41.720
What?

37:41.803 --> 37:46.308
My brother has seen more shit
than you will ever.

37:46.391 --> 37:49.353
You fucking bourgeois,
hipster dilettantes.

37:49.436 --> 37:50.729
Okay, okay.

37:51.355 --> 37:52.481
Come on.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.695
Yeah, go, Charlie. She said go.

37:58.779 --> 38:00.489
What a pleasant experience.
I thought we were friends.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.074
She didn't even smoke with us. That's why.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.700
Like, I really thought we were friends.

38:03.784 --> 38:04.785
Charlie.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.913
-That is what you get.
-Off you go, Charlie. Leave now.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.957
That's what you get for picking up strays.
Like, enough.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.745
Charlie, come on.

39:00.883 --> 39:02.301
Okay, how long?

39:03.135 --> 39:04.803
I don't know. A minute, less.

39:04.887 --> 39:08.140
A minute? A minute's good.
A minute's fine. What are we looking for?

39:08.223 --> 39:11.185
A message or a dead drop.
Something like that.

39:11.268 --> 39:12.436
-Okay.
-We're looking for a thing.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.354
Got that? A thing!

39:18.400 --> 39:21.069
-You sure this is the right place?
-Yeah. This is it.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.660
You hear that?

39:40.214 --> 39:41.548
Fuck.

39:42.174 --> 39:43.550
Allie.

39:43.634 --> 39:44.843
Come here.

39:45.552 --> 39:46.637
Ready?

39:47.137 --> 39:49.515
Three, two, one.

39:49.598 --> 39:52.226
Come on, up. Lift, lift, lift.

39:52.309 --> 39:54.061
Come on. There you go.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.077
Still think he's not fucking with us?

40:11.828 --> 40:13.413
Come on.

40:13.497 --> 40:14.623
Fuck.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.002
Hello?

40:21.547 --> 40:22.548
Fuck!

40:24.216 --> 40:25.926
Motherfucking bastard!

40:26.677 --> 40:27.678
Piece of shit.

40:33.976 --> 40:35.143
Come on. Come on, come on.

40:37.521 --> 40:38.522
Calaca?

40:41.608 --> 40:42.609
Hello?

40:44.069 --> 40:46.864
We're here. I'm here. We're here.

40:46.947 --> 40:48.156
You're too late.

40:48.907 --> 40:49.908
What?

40:49.992 --> 40:52.202
No, come on. We're here.

40:52.286 --> 40:54.997
Last stop. Be at Mercado Sonora.
Ten minutes.

40:55.622 --> 41:00.711
No. No, look, we made it.
We're here. Come on.

41:01.420 --> 41:02.462
You have a tail.

41:02.546 --> 41:04.047
We don't have a fucking tail.

41:04.131 --> 41:07.593
-There's no tail.
-We've been watching. You have a tail.

41:07.676 --> 41:11.305
There's no tail! No one knows
where we are. No tail!

41:11.388 --> 41:16.393
You can always stop.
Forget this, forget us, go home.

41:17.686 --> 41:19.688
We don't have a fucking home.

41:25.152 --> 41:26.153
Hello?

41:27.696 --> 41:28.739
Calaca?

41:32.201 --> 41:36.246
Mercado Sonora.
Be there in ten minutes or we'll be gone.

41:36.914 --> 41:39.541
If you have a tail, we'll be gone.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.919
If you call anyone, we'll be gone.

41:42.669 --> 41:45.547
If you do anything we don't like,
we'll be gone.

41:46.632 --> 41:47.841
Do you understand?

41:50.093 --> 41:51.553
-Yeah.
-Yes.

41:52.179 --> 41:53.847
We got it. Let's go.

41:53.931 --> 41:54.932
Let's go.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.201
Hey.

42:14.868 --> 42:17.538
-Anyone home?
-Hey.

42:22.084 --> 42:23.085
Oh, my God.

42:23.168 --> 42:24.795
What did you wanna tell me earlier?

42:30.342 --> 42:32.845
You said you needed to show me something.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.102
Nothing. It was nothing.

42:41.562 --> 42:42.563
Come on.

42:46.775 --> 42:47.985
Oh, boy.

42:55.701 --> 42:56.702
Do you want a dress?

42:56.785 --> 42:58.161
-What?
-A dress.

42:58.245 --> 43:00.205
Oh, sorry, we don't have any money.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.249
I sell dresses in my store.
It's over here.

43:02.332 --> 43:03.584
No dinero. No dinero.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.252
Dresses right over here.

43:05.335 --> 43:06.336
Come on.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.253
We're here. We're here.

44:29.336 --> 44:32.214
Keep heading north
until you reach the intersection.

44:32.297 --> 44:35.926
There's a covered market.
Head inside. We're watching.

44:48.272 --> 44:51.817
Look for the aisle
selling narco traficante figurines.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.861
Pass the Santa Muerte statues.

44:54.695 --> 44:56.113
Find the pork butcher.

45:07.291 --> 45:10.794
If you're not there in two minutes,
we'll assume you've changed your mind.

45:10.878 --> 45:11.920
We're almost there.

45:20.387 --> 45:23.765
Look for a man in an orange baseball cap.
He'll bring you to us.

45:24.391 --> 45:25.642
-Orange hat. An orange hat.
-Okay.

45:32.316 --> 45:33.817
-You've got a tail.
-What?

45:35.277 --> 45:37.654
-No! There's no tail!
-You've got a tail.

45:37.738 --> 45:39.489
Take the side exit to your left.

45:39.573 --> 45:40.616
Look for a side exit.

46:14.691 --> 46:16.818
This is bullshit.

46:16.902 --> 46:18.737
What the fuck is going on?

46:22.658 --> 46:24.660
You have reached your destination.

46:41.677 --> 46:42.886
Wait.

46:59.486 --> 47:00.696
Gracias.

47:09.830 --> 47:11.665
No!

47:18.213 --> 47:20.340
Fuck! No!

47:22.259 --> 47:23.385
No!

47:26.972 --> 47:27.973
Allie!

47:35.439 --> 47:37.316
What do we have here?
