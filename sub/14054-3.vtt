00:02.440 --> 00:04.396
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- I want you out of my house.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.552
- Mom's kind of a train wreck.
- What kind of mother abandons her child?

00:07.720 --> 00:09.950
- She has to come back, right?
- What happens if they don't find her? 

00:10.120 --> 00:11.633
In the morning I'll take him
to Child Services.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.392
- Are you running away?
- Got a better idea?

00:13.560 --> 00:16.027
- Where are we?
- One of my mom's housing developments.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.792
- How much do you need?
- It's $100,000.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.838
- What are you doing with my girlfriend?
- Kill me and quit talking about it.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.156
Dude, this place is on fire.
We gotta go.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.594
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?

00:26.760 --> 00:29.149
- We got some questions for you.
- It was an accident.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.072
Then we got some questions
for you too.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:48.600 --> 00:50.750
We gotta stop meeting like this.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.356
Some good news. Kirsten's company
has dropped all arson charges.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.195
Which means, pending your probation
hearing, you'll be out, no problem.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.199
When's that?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.510
Thirty to 60 days.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.232
I could have you out sooner...

01:05.400 --> 01:08.836
...if I could release you into the care
of a parent or a guardian.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.592
- He gets to leave?
- Who, Luke?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.990
According to both of you,
the fire was an accident.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.391
He's got no priors. His record's clean.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.475
And he has someone to take him home.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.309
Ryan, you know, if I could...

01:34.440 --> 01:35.714
It's gonna be okay.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.835
My mom ditched me, I burned your wife's
house down, how is this gonna be okay?

01:43.480 --> 01:45.755
- We'll find your mother.
- And what if we don't?

01:45.920 --> 01:48.195
- We will do whatever it takes.
- I mean...

01:48.360 --> 01:50.669
...what if I don't want to find her?

01:52.840 --> 01:55.638
If only you'd come to me
instead of running away.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.109
So I could end up
in Child Services and foster care?

01:58.960 --> 02:01.633
- You could have died in that fire.
- Look...

02:02.120 --> 02:05.510
...you've done more than enough.
I can take care of myself.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.398
Won't be that different
from how it's been.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.911
We'll talk again before your hearing.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.958
Tell your wife thanks.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.554
Already did.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.517
Step back.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.472
Sorry.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.518
You ain't now, but you will be.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.910
Now all we need are the Bellinis.
And can you make mine a double?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.878
Wow. You're all set up for
your Newpsie convention.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.917
Hey, when do these vultures land?

03:29.080 --> 03:32.959
Soon. And I'm sure that I have
a doily out of place somewhere.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.872
Good. Gives them something
to talk about.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.554
I don't know why you have them over.
You don't like them.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.711
I don't don't like them.
I grew up with them.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.519
They're my oldest friends.
Besides, it's for charity.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.830
What's on the agenda?
What are you dragging me to?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.355
Casino Night.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.193
This home-from-the-office
housewife thing, it's really...

03:50.360 --> 03:52.271
- Disturbing?
- Hot.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.749
Disturbingly hot.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.470
Hey. What you doing?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.392
Nothing. I'm grounded.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.879
Well, you're handling it well.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.230
You're lucky you're only grounded.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.473
You gonna see him?

04:12.640 --> 04:15.279
Ryan? No. There's nothing
I can do for him right now.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.396
Yeah? You think he's okay?

04:18.240 --> 04:21.152
There's a reason why I like to try
to keep kids out of those places.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.675
You can't get him out?
You're just not a good enough lawyer?

04:23.840 --> 04:27.355
- My hands are tied until we find his mom.
- So then why can't he stay here?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.954
I will not have this conversation again.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.156
Rosa, can you make sure
that the scones go inside?

04:32.320 --> 04:35.517
If anything happens to Ryan, it's on
you, so I hope you can live with that.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.229
What I can't live with is if something
was to happen to you because of him.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.119
- Like I meet someone who doesn't suck?
- We're not his parents.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.475
- I am not his mother.
- Good thing.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.074
Hey. Get back here. Apologize.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.911
- Ladies.
- Sandy, hi, how are you?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.150
Are you holding up okay?
That poor boy.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.197
- He's locked up, yes?
- Yeah, temporarily.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.909
Well, nobody blames you for bringing him
into the community. You're so trusting.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.316
Hey, Julie. Their house looks good.
I thought you said it burned down.

05:11.480 --> 05:15.519
Not this one, one of Kirsten's
developments. Luckily, she has so many.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.549
Well, I should be off.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.314
Gotta find the next kid
to jeopardize the community.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.119
Maybe a black kid. Or an Asian kid.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.429
Bye, ladies.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.674
- How about a Bellini?
- Yes!

05:29.840 --> 05:31.193
Look at this food!

05:43.280 --> 05:46.875
Who's sorry now? You got a problem?
You disrespecting me?

05:47.040 --> 05:50.032
As long as you here,
you best watch out for me, man.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.876
I think it's an embarrassment that we still
don't have a theme for the fundraiser.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.759
- Well, it's Casino Night.
- I thought it was Monte Carlo Night.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.832
- No, it's Vegas Night.
- See, this is a travesty.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.992
It can't be Monte Carlo Night.
Cotillion is coming up.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.755
Don't you remember our amendment? No
two black-tie events in the same month.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.433
I'll be right back.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.511
I have to go...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.877
...check on the thing.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.594
She's been through so much.
Her son was friends with that boy.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.316
Where do you think you're going?

06:58.960 --> 07:02.396
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm taking a break. Where are you going?

07:02.560 --> 07:04.949
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Seth.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.153
I'm going to juvie to visit Ryan.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.231
No. No, you're not. No way.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.790
- Okay. Bye.
- Seth.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.713
I know that I am not the
perfect Carol Brady mom...

07:16.880 --> 07:19.189
...but I love you,
and I am trying to protect you.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.591
I have dropped all the charges. I have
hired somebody to find his mother.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.194
What more do you want?

07:29.440 --> 07:32.034
I would like you to go with me.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.350
Kirsten? Oh, there you are.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.750
We're talking about the bunting.
Is acetate okay?

07:37.840 --> 07:40.479
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.473
Give me 15 minutes to lose the ladies.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.268
Can I try this on?

07:49.440 --> 07:51.032
Summer, my dad's home, you know.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.792
You say that like it's a bad thing.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.359
Oh, gross!

07:54.520 --> 07:56.476
Your dad's always home these days.
What's up?

07:57.200 --> 08:00.590
Hey, Luke, it's me. I just...

08:00.840 --> 08:03.513
...wanted to talk. So call me.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.548
Please.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.392
Still hasn't called you back?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.551
He was in lockup.
Maybe he's into dudes now.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.476
God, he loves you. He got in a fight
and burnt a house down over you.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.631
That's hot. What more do you need?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.756
- How about talking to me?
- He'll get over it.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.590
He can't really think
you're into that Chino kid.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.954
So how's your mother?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.475
Just... married.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.669
Marissa, you've got company.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.114
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.828
Hi, Summer. I'm... I'm... I'm Seth Cohen.
I live... I live right next door.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.159
What's up?

08:44.159 --> 08:45.593
What?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.512
Yes, what is up.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.195
I'm going to visit Ryan. I thought maybe
you'd like to come. He'd love to see you.

08:52.360 --> 08:56.956
What's that, Seth? Did you say you need
a ride to a <i>Star Wars</i> convention?

08:57.120 --> 09:01.159
<i>Star Wars</i> ? I'm sorry, her top was off.
You couldn't have at least said <i>X- Men</i> ?

09:01.960 --> 09:06.351
I can't go with you. I can't see Ryan.
I mean, Luke's not talking to me as it is.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.954
So what? Ryan's in jail.
I thought we were all friends.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.271
It's just... It's too complicated.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.873
- To visit him?
- I can't, okay?

09:16.160 --> 09:17.912
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.230
Let's just make this quick, okay?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.750
Kirsten and Seth Cohen.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.639
Hey.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.031
- What happened to your neck?
- It's nothing.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.792
- You okay?
- Great.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.038
So I'm sorry the plan didn't work.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.190
I thought I had it figured out.
I thought you were safe. I was wrong.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.193
What's the matter? Give me a smile.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.069
So Marissa seemed pretty weird
when I tried to talk to her.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.710
- What happened between you guys?
- You got a nice swerve on you. You fine.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.189
- Hey, leave her alone.
- Ryan, it's okay.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.918
Are you joking? Is this your honey?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.991
Come here, bitch,
I wanna get a look at you.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.720
- Seth, let's go, now.
- I only need two minutes.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.154
- Leave her alone.
- Seth, now.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.753
- What you gonna do?
- Guards!

11:03.040 --> 11:04.029
Guards!

11:06.200 --> 11:07.952
I'll kill you, punk!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.679
You're dead! You hear me?
You're dead!

11:35.200 --> 11:38.875
Seth, what did we say?
No video games.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.271
I never knew you
to be an impulse shopper.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.839
I didn't know what else to do.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.434
- Did you tell him it was permanent?
- No, of course not.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.309
We can't jerk him around, pulling him
out of juvie, sending him to foster care...

11:56.480 --> 11:58.994
...giving him hope and taking it away.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.630
They were gonna kill him in that place.
He couldn't stay there.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.349
But he can't stay here.
We've got to find his mother.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.511
- He doesn't want to find her.
- He's a kid.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.352
He doesn't know what he wants.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.476
So I guess I won't unpack.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.678
Hey.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.479
Help yourself to a wide assortment
of breakfast cereals.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.950
So, Ryan, what...?

12:40.680 --> 12:44.036
What exactly happened that night with
Marissa before Luke showed up?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.191
- She came to see me.
- And?

12:46.360 --> 12:48.874
- And I told her to leave.
- You asked her to leave?

12:49.480 --> 12:52.358
That's it? You two were up there
all alone and you expect me...?

12:52.520 --> 12:54.954
I thought I was taking off
in the morning.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.313
- It didn't seem right.
- You're still here. She's next door.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.599
I don't know. I said some things.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.637
So now's your chance to take it back.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.638
Hey. I'm off.
They're waiting for me in the ballroom.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.870
Those ladies can't do anything
unless I'm there.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.758
Hey, you should come. It'll be fun.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.354
Well, not fun, but it's for charity.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.313
No, thanks.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.835
Marissa, honey, enough moping.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.231
It's sweet that you're so concerned about
this boy, but he's in the system now.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.913
He's being taken care of.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.878
And he's not your responsibility
because he's in love with you.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.951
He's not in love with me.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.998
Why not?
He thinks he's too good for you?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.038
Actually, he thinks
I'm too good for him.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.714
Well, he's right. But that's the past.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.919
And you need to focus on the future,
which means Luke.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.196
You've invested so much
with Luke, honey.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.669
Your relationship has
too much potential...

13:47.840 --> 13:50.957
...to be squandered by
some silly misunderstanding.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.989
So finish your hair, put on a nice top
and please come join me at the club.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.874
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.158
That's what I'm here for.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.795
I have to make some calls, so if you
could finish up, that would be terrific.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.757
Where are you going?

14:09.920 --> 14:13.754
I've got an early court date,
then I'm in and out of the office.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.718
I have to set up for Casino Night.
What about Ryan?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.515
I called the private investigator
about his mother.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.750
Yeah, but what am I
supposed to do with him?

14:22.480 --> 14:24.391
Take him with you.
Spend some time together.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.757
- With all those women there?
- Sure. They'll love him.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.559
- Hi, Julie.
- Kirsten, Seth.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.073
Julie, this is Ryan.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.355
I'm Julie Cooper.
I've heard so much about you.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.793
- Nice to meet you too.
- There he is.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.115
Hey, Mrs. Cooper. How you doing?

14:50.280 --> 14:53.033
- Hey, Luke.
- Hi, Luke. Thanks for coming.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.954
You know, anything I can do to help
make amends for what happened.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.553
Luke, it's good to see you.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.598
Ryan, I forgot that he was coming.
If you wanna...

15:01.760 --> 15:03.830
No, I'm here. How can I help?

15:04.280 --> 15:08.671
Well, now that we have our big, strong,
strapping men, time for heavy lifting.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.680
Hey. I was hoping maybe we could talk.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.076
Which one of us did you want to talk to?

15:23.240 --> 15:24.514
Luke, come on.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.831
Sorry. I feel like ever since I've
gotten here, I've screwed everything up.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.594
No, I'm sorry. It's my fault too.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.433
I mean, I never should have left Luke
to see you that night.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.309
- And those things you said before...
- I didn't... What I said...

15:45.480 --> 15:48.438
You were right.
We're from two different worlds.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.911
I'm glad you're okay.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.638
Okay. What happened
up at that house with me and her...

16:07.800 --> 16:11.509
I don't want to hear about it. You and I
have nothing to say to each other.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.873
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.679
All I know is, you and me, we're done.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.799
Okay, boys. Ryan, why don't you
come with me. New project.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.633
- Thank you.
- How dare they?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.950
This boy is violent. He's a menace.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.352
They may forgive and forget, but I don't.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.511
You're right. You are right.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.955
The police are taking
criminals off the street...

16:44.120 --> 16:46.350
...and Sandy Cohen is putting them
in my back yard.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.636
- How does she put up with it?
- Who, Kirsten?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.917
She's never home. She's always
working, building her empire.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.399
I feel sorry for her.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.949
Dr. Phil did a show on mothers
who avoid home life...

16:56.120 --> 16:58.509
...by becoming workaholics. So sad.

16:58.680 --> 17:02.798
I just hope she has a vault and she keeps
her jewels locked up. She has expensive...

17:02.960 --> 17:05.428
Hey, ladies. Care if I join you?

17:09.280 --> 17:10.792
You mind?

17:11.960 --> 17:14.234
So I couldn't help but overhear.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.233
- I... Well, I hope that you're not...
- Mad? Offended? No.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.348
I am disappointed.
And frankly, I'm a little surprised.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.114
This is supposed to be a community
that welcomes outsiders.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.432
I mean, me, I'm all the way from the
Bronx. And you're from Riverside, right?

17:29.600 --> 17:32.956
Which is not that different from
where Ryan's from. Excuse me a minute.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.033
Hello?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.437
Yeah. Dawn. That's her.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.517
Good job.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.352
Okay. Bye.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.638
Thanks for the muffin.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.678
Can I have a napkin? Now?

17:56.840 --> 18:01.118
What am I supposed to do
with 120,000 pounds of concrete?

18:02.960 --> 18:04.916
Get a new mixer.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.314
Just call me when you know.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.989
What do you do exactly?
Real estate or construction?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.354
Dude, don't ask.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.115
I tried to explain it to Seth once,
and he fell asleep halfway through.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.397
Okay. But...
Yeah, that's pretty much true.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.473
Try me.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.996
My dad is in real-estate development.
He owns the Newport Group.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.957
Wow. You guys built the mall?

18:29.120 --> 18:31.475
Civic auditorium? Baseball stadium?
Stuff like that?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.437
I'm in charge of residential development.

18:33.920 --> 18:37.117
So you deal with contractors, architects,
planning and zoning commission?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.748
- How'd you know?
- I worked construction a couple summers.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.388
And I used to want to be an architect.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.434
- And what do you want to be now?
- Seventeen.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.514
Me too.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.433
Hey. I thought you were setting up at...

18:58.800 --> 19:01.268
You will not believe
what Sandy Cohen said to me.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.069
He basically called me white trash.
He said I was from Riverside.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.231
Honey, you are from Riverside.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.193
It was his tone.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.158
Compare me to that boy,
and to bring him to our function...

19:12.320 --> 19:15.835
Kirsten is out of control.
She thinks the rules don't apply to her?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.992
I know you were young, but how you ever
dated that woman, I can't understand.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.311
- I have half a mind to call and tell her...
- Leave Kirsten alone.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.392
She's the one paying our bills.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.751
What are you talking about?

19:30.160 --> 19:34.790
You know that problem
I was having at work? Well...

19:35.360 --> 19:36.713
...she solved it.

19:38.200 --> 19:42.159
You went to Kirsten for a handout?
How do you think this makes us look?

19:42.320 --> 19:46.074
- I wouldn't really call it a handout.
- Oh, really? What would you call it?

19:48.840 --> 19:50.956
A hundred thousand dollars.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.313
That machine ate my change.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.278
Okay, okay. That one's always broken.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.829
Here you go. Try the next one over.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.593
Dawn Atwood?
Sandy Cohen, Ryan's attorney.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.917
- I'd love to talk to you.
- I can't talk.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.756
- This stupid thing's stuck.
- It'll only take a couple of minutes.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.231
Damn it!

20:29.160 --> 20:30.354
How is he?

20:31.440 --> 20:34.557
Why don't we grab a cup of coffee
and talk about it?

20:41.880 --> 20:45.839
There's some historical homes in the area.
We can go on an architectural tour.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.629
- Yeah, those things are awesome.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.038
Hey, Ry.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.078
Thank you, Rosa.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.358
Thanks.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.953
No, thank you.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.239
So, Dawn, how long you been
working at the Laundromat?

21:30.400 --> 21:32.595
Not long. Just a couple weeks.

21:32.760 --> 21:36.116
- What happened to the restaurant?
- They were making cutbacks.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.713
You got fired.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.478
Well, it was for the best.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.349
They had rats, cockroaches. Disgusting.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.832
You seen Trey?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.231
I went to visit him at the prison.
He wouldn't see me.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.632
- Where are you living these days?
- With friends. I'm between places now.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.160
- Why don't you stay here tonight?
- What about A.J.?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.468
No. I broke up with him.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.792
We're through.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.439
No more.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.913
I put up with too much.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.436
He laid his hands on me
and Ryan too many times.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.194
- Mom.
- What?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.078
I'm just saying...

22:25.800 --> 22:27.870
...he was a bad influence, you know.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.429
- With his drinking...
- Because A.J. Was the problem.

22:31.720 --> 22:35.349
Hey, I haven't touched a drop
since I dumped his sorry ass last week.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.592
The scum he used to bring
into the house, his whole coke thing...

22:39.480 --> 22:42.756
- Where you going?
- It was bad enough living it the first time.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.672
Ryan. Wait, sweetie.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.434
Sorry.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.999
- Will you at least talk to me?
- What are you even doing here?

22:59.160 --> 23:01.879
I came for you.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.270
Why? What do you want from me?

23:04.920 --> 23:06.239
You left a note.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.199
- A note.
- Let me explain...

23:09.360 --> 23:11.715
You abandoned me.
You threw me out. You just took off.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.189
I know, honey. I was...

23:15.080 --> 23:18.436
And A.J. And the drinking and...

23:21.800 --> 23:24.234
It's gonna be different now.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.792
That's what you said when we moved
from Fresno after Dad got arrested.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.871
I'm gonna be different now.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.474
We have a chance to start over, babe.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.349
We've never had people like them,
you know, who wanted to help us.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.589
Right.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.150
Someone offers you a nice place to stay,
suddenly you're all about the mom thing.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.638
I didn't know what I was doing
when I married your dad.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.439
I was too young
when I had your brother.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.472
But with you...

23:55.800 --> 23:58.519
You were always the smart one,
you know?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.632
The good one.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.989
When you got arrested...

24:07.120 --> 24:09.475
...I knew I'd failed, and...

24:11.520 --> 24:13.795
...you were my last hope.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.318
I should go.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.959
Wait.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.510
You ever gonna forgive me, kiddo?

24:36.400 --> 24:38.630
Let's just go slow, huh?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.388
Okay.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.152
Whatever you want.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.152
I'm not gonna lose you again.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.789
- So where did they go, anyways?
- I don't know. Out.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.315
All right. So we'll just
wait for happy hour to end.

25:03.480 --> 25:06.756
Seth, we need to be supportive.
She seems like she's trying.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.638
Yeah, but how do you know?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.475
I mean, this woman abandoned him,
and now all she has to do is show up?

25:12.640 --> 25:15.552
Come on. She should be the one
that's on probation, not Ryan.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.075
You want me to invite her to stay
so we can watch her?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.629
Yes, that is exactly
what I want you to do.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.151
What a beautiful walk.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.912
The water's so warm.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.991
Not that Ryan would know.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.709
- You used to love going in the water.
- Not with all my clothes on.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.359
I'm an embarrassment to my son.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.431
Welcome to my world.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.711
Well, we should probably
head out soon.

25:43.760 --> 25:47.992
Actually, I was thinking. You just
got here, you have nowhere to stay.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.237
We're all just getting to know
each other.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.038
- We're having a party tonight.
- Right.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.191
Not for me. But thanks, though.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.272
- Vegas Night.
- Vegas, huh?

25:57.840 --> 26:01.276
It's very kind of you to offer,
but I don't have anything to wear.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.112
We'll find something.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.392
Kirsten does the same thing.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.472
Washes the dishes before
putting them in the dishwasher.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.359
I never know whether
they're clean or dirty.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.476
We never had a dishwasher.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.072
- So how's everything going?
- Okay, I guess.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.152
We had a good day.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.275
You being with your mother doesn't mean
we're not gonna still see each other.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.158
She really likes it here.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.710
She talked about finding
someplace small nearby.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.791
In the numbered streets.

26:42.720 --> 26:43.948
So...

26:45.280 --> 26:46.679
...how do I look?

27:04.920 --> 27:07.036
All their parties like this?

27:07.200 --> 27:09.077
Pretty much.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.755
Well, let's clean them out, kid.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.192
- Kirsten.
- Excuse me.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.191
Another perfect event.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.510
So business is good?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.033
Yeah, it's good.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.919
- I love your dress.
- You do? It's yours.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.151
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

27:30.320 --> 27:32.311
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.397
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.997
- It's all fabulous. Just fabulous.
- Thank you.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.515
How much did you get for the hug?

27:54.720 --> 27:56.278
Betting kind of big, Mom?

27:56.440 --> 27:59.512
It's for charity.
Besides, the count's way positive.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.558
You're counting?
It's not a single deck.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.029
Oh, honey, if I teach you
anything in this world...

28:05.200 --> 28:07.555
...the count goes way higher
with multiple decks.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.151
Blackjack.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.278
See, honey?
My luck's turning around already.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.759
Yes!

28:21.280 --> 28:22.759
That's beautiful.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.912
I told you we could do it. I told you too!

28:33.800 --> 28:37.190
Excuse me.
Tonic water and lime, please?

28:42.640 --> 28:44.198
My boy.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.079
Lucky for him, he's got my brains.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.993
Go.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.435
Have fun with your friend.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.319
I'll be fine.
You don't have to babysit me.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.270
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.512
So is that your mom?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.193
Yeah.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.316
She came back, so I guess
that means you're going home.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.752
Yeah, I guess.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.470
Well, good luck with everything.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.029
You too. Have a nice life.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.352
You should go.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.117
Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.236
I'm superstitious. Blow on these.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.757
- What?
- Blow.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.278
We're good! Do it again.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.190
- You're not going anywhere, Syd.
- Seth.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.759
- Whatever.
- Okay.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.558
Blow.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.910
You can't just not talk to me.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.273
Watch me.

30:41.800 --> 30:46.112
It's not like you're innocent in all this.
I mean, you didn't have to attack him.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.510
What was I supposed to do?

30:48.800 --> 30:51.360
You left me to go up there for him.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.278
It's not like that.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.351
It was a mistake.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.833
Hell, yeah.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.398
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hey, Julie.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.678
I came to apologize and say thank you.
The check that you guys gave Jimmy.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.999
You never know who your friends are
until you're in need.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.593
And we needed that 100 grand.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.748
It was our pleasure.
You can't take it with you.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.035
- Hi.
- What do you want?

31:29.200 --> 31:31.760
Nothing happened
with Marissa and me.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.673
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Listen.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.595
She chose you.
You're the one she wants.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.956
Can I get a 7 and 7, please?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.872
Nerves. Tough game of poker.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.472
Thank you.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.553
- Want some dessert?
- Yeah, we could have a little piece.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.516
Always does the trick.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.875
You rock, Stanley.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.353
Hey.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.192
Let's try again.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.598
Oh, crap. My damn luck, huh?

32:57.720 --> 33:01.633
Well, pony up, honey. Don't be shy.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.474
My new best friend. Thank you.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.911
Don't you think you've had enough?

33:18.360 --> 33:19.952
You're right.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.749
Just gotta learn to celebrate
without the sauce.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.869
Well, no one said it was
going to be easy.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.399
Could we talk? It's important.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.391
Of course. Excuse us.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.788
Sure.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.998
- You want to hear something so funny?
- Always.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.516
Sandy Cohen had no idea
Kirsten wrote you that check.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.958
Imagine being so rich you don't tell your
husband you're giving away $100,000.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.270
Right. You know what?

33:57.440 --> 33:59.795
Who needs chips? You got Kirsten.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.919
What did you say to him?

34:02.080 --> 34:04.514
You don't care how this makes me feel,
that you went to her.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.910
I had no choice.
You didn't want to talk about it.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.831
I was trying to save us.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.355
Our family was in trouble.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.713
Looks like we're not the only ones.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.839
A hundred thousand dollars!
That's more than I make in a year.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.995
It's just a loan...

34:21.159 --> 34:22.513
...of my money.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.989
It's not the money.
It's that you never told me.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.312
I know.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.550
- I don't know why.
- I got a couple of ideas.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.917
Let me take you on a journey through
my neuroses for the past hour or so.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.958
Sandy, I promise. It was just a loan,
there's nothing more to it.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.998
He was in trouble,
there was no one else he could tell.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.752
So, what's your excuse?

34:40.920 --> 34:44.549
Sandy, I don't know
what Julie said to you.

34:44.719 --> 34:47.792
I'm trying to have a private
conversation with my wife.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.831
Two Mountain Dews, my good man.
Thank you. Ryan, greatest night ever.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.437
It's like those nights when the stars
and the cosmos and the moon align...

35:00.600 --> 35:03.398
...and it's just, like, wow.
Thank you. How's your mom doing?

35:04.080 --> 35:06.355
- High rolling. She was made for this place.
- Yeah?

35:06.520 --> 35:09.239
- Well, then maybe this could work.
- Yeah, maybe.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.428
Rabbit's foot? <i>V Àmonos.</i>

35:13.600 --> 35:16.433
By the end of the night,
she might know my first name.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.592
Duty calls.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.318
Look, I'm sorry.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.159
Hold up.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.110
- Oh, God.
- What the hell is your problem?

35:40.280 --> 35:43.636
What's my problem?
What's your problem? Back off.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.031
Ryan, I must have tripped.
It's these damn shoes.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.719
Hello?

35:58.560 --> 36:00.198
Here, good luck.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.356
- Dude, that lady is wasted.
- I bet you could bang her.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.033
Hey, shut up.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.790
Why don't you just quit staring
and help me up, okay? Get me up!

36:15.720 --> 36:17.392
Help me up!

36:17.560 --> 36:19.391
Finally. Jeez.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.869
Hey, Seth,
why don't you go get the car.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.110
- What, maybe you had one too many?
- No, I...

36:24.280 --> 36:26.475
What are you looking at?

36:26.640 --> 36:28.232
Where's Ryan? Ryan?

36:28.400 --> 36:30.356
Thanks, man. I'm right here, Mom.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.750
Ryan, honey, I'm so sorry.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.239
I ruined it, huh?

36:34.400 --> 36:38.678
- It's okay. We're almost there.
- No, no, I've ruined everything, huh?

36:39.600 --> 36:42.353
- You hate me.
- No, I don't.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.351
I love you, Mom.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.911
It's okay, everyone.
It's just a... It's a little accident.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.276
She's with us.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.111
You mind?

38:07.040 --> 38:10.157
So... You caught me.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.710
- You can't do this. You're his mother.
- I'm a mess, not a mother.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.599
- You have a responsibility.
- I'm being responsible.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.557
I'm not wired for this.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.393
I can't care for anybody else.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.798
I don't have what you got.

38:30.160 --> 38:34.756
The way your husband looks at you
and your kid looks at you.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.117
Even my kid.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.833
Like no matter what,
you're gonna make everything okay.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.350
You hold your family together.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.516
I tear mine apart.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.435
You can't walk away.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.113
Why?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.996
This will be the first good thing
I ever did for him.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.758
This way...

39:05.040 --> 39:06.359
...he ends up with a real mom.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.791
Take care of him, okay?

39:11.960 --> 39:13.632
He deserves it.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.273
Thanks.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.836
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.159
- Where's...?
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.317
That's awesome.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.839
I mean, that's...
That's awesome, right?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.151
Let's go talk about stuff. Come on.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.470
I'll unpack later.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.030
Well, there's a no-return policy now,
you know that.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.915
I love you. You know that?

41:05.600 --> 41:07.318
Are we okay?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.913
Yeah.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.833
Good.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.436
Because we just got in
way over our heads.

41:21.160 --> 41:25.073
So then she says, "Blow on these."
And clearly, she's talking about...
