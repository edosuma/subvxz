00:05.749 --> 00:09.150
NARRATOR: <i>Gob Bluth had just</i>
<i>been told by his father</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:11.653
<i>to go to work</i>
<i>for his younger brother.</i>

00:11.693 --> 00:13.447
And then thanks
for the birthday card

00:13.489 --> 00:16.574
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.410
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact,</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.454
<i>- it was a brother with whom Gob...</i>
- What the hell?

00:20.496 --> 00:21.663
- (horns honking)
<i>- ...was secretly competitive.</i>

00:21.704 --> 00:22.956
MICHAEL:
I got the right of way.

00:22.998 --> 00:25.375
- GOB: N-No.
- MICHAEL: Okay. (laughs)

00:25.417 --> 00:29.004
NARRATOR: <i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that sense of competition...</i>

00:29.045 --> 00:31.631
(tires screeching, horn honking)

00:31.673 --> 00:33.758
<i>...that led</i>
<i>to this tinkling match.</i>

00:33.800 --> 00:35.593
GOB:
<i>I've met someone.</i>

00:35.635 --> 00:38.305
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

00:38.347 --> 00:39.973
- I also met someone.
- Have you?

00:40.015 --> 00:42.184
Also famousy.
Can't give <i>you</i> any information.

00:42.225 --> 00:44.686
- Is it Julie Bowen?
- No, it's not.

00:44.727 --> 00:46.355
- Is yours Julie Bowen?
- Is yours Julie...?

00:46.396 --> 00:49.107
Oh, my God, Michael,
you're seeing Julie Bowen?

00:49.149 --> 00:50.359
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

00:50.400 --> 00:52.569
but if you are,
you tell me right now.

00:52.610 --> 00:55.322
I want to hear you say the words
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

00:55.364 --> 00:57.491
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

00:57.533 --> 00:58.950
Well, that's a funny way
to phrase it.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.785
NARRATOR:
<i>This went on for some time,</i>

01:00.827 --> 01:03.497
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they started talking business.</i>

01:03.539 --> 01:05.541
If it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

01:05.582 --> 01:06.749
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

01:06.791 --> 01:08.418
- to bring the people in.
- (squawk)

01:08.460 --> 01:10.795
- Lindsay.
<i>- But soon the hard lemonade softened</i>

01:10.837 --> 01:12.548
<i>- their competitive edge.</i>
- No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

01:12.589 --> 01:14.090
<i>And Michael confessed</i>

01:14.132 --> 01:18.136
<i>that he had grown estranged</i>
<i>from his son.</i>

01:18.178 --> 01:19.471
I'll call him for you.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.557
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

01:21.598 --> 01:23.392
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.019
You know, when I said that, that
these places sell themselves,

01:26.061 --> 01:29.856
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that, that, uh...

01:29.898 --> 01:31.441
No, they don't.

01:31.483 --> 01:33.776
No, I'm not talking
about selling these mausoleums.

01:33.818 --> 01:36.029
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

01:36.071 --> 01:38.407
I'm gonna destroy his career the
same way that he destroyed mine.

01:38.448 --> 01:40.867
NARRATOR: <i>Gob was referring</i>
<i>to an escape act</i>

01:40.909 --> 01:42.744
<i>he'd performed that had failed</i>

01:42.785 --> 01:44.496
<i>when the hidden compartment</i>
<i>that held</i>

01:44.538 --> 01:46.998
<i>the keys to his escape</i>
<i>hadn't opened...</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:48.166
- It's not going to work.
<i>- ...humiliating him</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:49.585
<i>in front of his bride...</i>

01:49.626 --> 01:51.920
<i>- uh, her...</i>
- He's not coming back.

01:51.961 --> 01:54.005
<i>...and all of Christendom.</i>

01:54.047 --> 01:56.508
Destroying Tony Wonder is
your sense of purpose?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.051
I thought you said,
thanks to me...

01:58.093 --> 01:59.344
Because he's performing
at a gay club tonight,

01:59.386 --> 02:00.762
and I need you to act as
my boyfriend

02:00.803 --> 02:01.804
to help me get in.

02:01.846 --> 02:03.640
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

02:03.681 --> 02:05.308
And don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

02:05.350 --> 02:06.768
I am your brother.

02:06.809 --> 02:08.562
You sound like my son.

02:08.604 --> 02:11.648
NARRATOR: <i>Whom Gob had spoken to</i>
<i>earlier that day.</i>

02:11.689 --> 02:14.025
<i>- And in a van, by the way.</i>
- Hey, you remembered.

02:14.067 --> 02:18.363
(chuckles) How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

02:18.405 --> 02:19.615
(laughing):
I love magic, of course.

02:19.656 --> 02:21.617
I mean, my dad's a magician.

02:21.658 --> 02:25.370
- Well, you're my dad, I mean,
so, so you should know. - Right.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.124
Well, it'd be sort of a, a
father-son thing at a gay club.

02:29.165 --> 02:30.959
Well, technically gay night
at a magic club.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.502
Hey, you know what'd be funny?

02:32.544 --> 02:34.254
If you pretended
to be my boyfriend

02:34.296 --> 02:35.422
so I could lock
this guy Tony Wonder...

02:35.464 --> 02:37.257
You know, I-I don't know,

02:37.299 --> 02:39.884
I-I don't think this whole thing
is sounding like a good idea.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.220
Besides, last time we tried
to do something together,

02:42.262 --> 02:43.805
- you didn't even show up.
- You know what?

02:43.846 --> 02:46.141
You're mad at me--
I get it, I totally get it,

02:46.182 --> 02:48.977
- and guess what--I'm mad at you.
- You know, Dad,

02:49.018 --> 02:51.480
that attitude might be
why you're alone all the time.

02:51.521 --> 02:53.565
- The way you treat people...
- What about you?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.192
I didn't hear from you
for your entire childhood,

02:56.234 --> 02:57.944
and then thanks
for the birthday card

02:57.986 --> 03:02.282
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

03:02.324 --> 03:03.866
NARRATOR:
<i>This was extra hard for Steve</i>

03:03.908 --> 03:06.035
<i>to hear on his actual birthday.</i>

03:06.077 --> 03:07.370
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in

03:07.412 --> 03:09.164
- his trick?
- Oh, yeah, but that

03:09.205 --> 03:11.082
wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.043
- Just like Tony Wonder.
<i>- And it didn't work. Besides,</i>

03:14.085 --> 03:16.129
that's before I knew that
he had locked me in my trick.

03:16.171 --> 03:18.423
You still don't know that he
tried to lock you in your trick.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.342
Hey, I do know, I have proof.

03:20.383 --> 03:25.054
I went in that cave
and I found this.

03:25.096 --> 03:26.640
We both know
what that stands for.

03:26.682 --> 03:27.683
Jesus.

03:27.724 --> 03:28.808
No, that would be a "J."

03:28.850 --> 03:30.226
This is a "T."

03:30.268 --> 03:32.312
Tony Wonder was there
in the cave the night

03:32.354 --> 03:34.564
that I did my big illusion,
so when I went yesterday

03:34.606 --> 03:36.566
to the cave and I saw
that this had wedged

03:36.608 --> 03:39.486
my compartment door shut,
I knew that I'd been wronged.

03:39.528 --> 03:40.808
Okay, the only thing
that we know

03:40.820 --> 03:43.406
is that you tried to
lock Tony Wonder

03:43.448 --> 03:44.366
in his trick first.

03:44.407 --> 03:45.659
- Right?
- No,

03:45.701 --> 03:46.951
- no.
- So you're even.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.578
Because mine didn't work.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.539
He got the last laugh,
which, in this case, happened

03:50.580 --> 03:51.998
to be the first laugh.
I don't understand

03:52.040 --> 03:53.375
why you can't seem to follow me

03:53.416 --> 03:55.168
- on any of this.
- Gob, you've got a chance

03:55.210 --> 03:57.671
to build a brand-new life.
Don't run away from it again.

03:57.713 --> 03:59.715
- Don't try to escape it.
- I don't do that, Michael.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.550
Listen, if you insist
on speaking to me like you're

04:01.591 --> 04:03.885
my wife, then don't be surprised
to find my (bleep) in you

04:03.926 --> 04:05.928
and then you never hear
from me again.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.181
(sighs)
I'm offering you a good job

04:08.223 --> 04:11.393
selling good homes,
making real good money,

04:11.434 --> 04:16.022
and I'm not asking
for anything in return.

04:16.064 --> 04:17.899
What is this?

04:17.940 --> 04:19.192
I'm asking for a little
something in return.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.569
These-- this is for the movie.

04:20.610 --> 04:22.320
This is for your life rights
in perpetuity,

04:22.362 --> 04:24.322
in the known universe
and beyond.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.115
Blah, blah, blah, look at this.

04:26.157 --> 04:27.992
What's that mean--
you're not gonna sign it?

04:28.034 --> 04:29.536
No, I was just thinking

04:29.578 --> 04:32.080
that I should have my attorney
Bob Loblaw look at this.

04:32.121 --> 04:34.082
Oh, he doesn't need to-- it's
all pretty boilerplate stuff.

04:34.123 --> 04:35.204
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.959
I'm gonna be in a movie.

04:37.001 --> 04:38.127
- (laughs)
- No, you're not.

04:38.169 --> 04:40.547
I'm gonna be in a movie. Okay.

04:40.589 --> 04:42.257
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

04:42.298 --> 04:45.927
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

04:45.968 --> 04:47.596
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

04:47.637 --> 04:49.472
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

04:53.643 --> 04:55.520
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.275
<i>Gob was making good</i>
<i>on a promise</i>

05:00.316 --> 05:02.110
<i>- he had made to Michael...</i>
- GEORGE MICHAEL: Hi, Uncle Gob.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.070
I need to see you tonight.

05:04.112 --> 05:06.948
<i>- ...to talk to his son.</i>
- It's about your father and you.

05:06.989 --> 05:09.284
Really, is... is he upset?

05:09.325 --> 05:11.369
(over phone):
Do I seem like a clown to you?

05:11.411 --> 05:12.746
I got it.

05:12.788 --> 05:14.468
Do I seem like some kind
of a clown to you?

05:14.497 --> 05:16.458
Look, I got it, I got it,
Uncle Gob, just tell me where.

05:16.499 --> 05:19.294
Meet me tonight
at the Gothic Castle.

05:19.335 --> 05:20.712
I will-- the Gothic Castle?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.297
No, the Gothicassle.
Yes, the Gothic Castle.

05:22.338 --> 05:23.965
No, I didn't say
the Gothicassle.

05:24.006 --> 05:25.842
What, what do you think,
they call it the Gothicassle?

05:25.883 --> 05:27.176
No, I said the Gothic Castle.

05:27.218 --> 05:28.804
- It's the Gothic Castle.
- Gothic Castle.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.012
Okay.

05:30.054 --> 05:32.641
TAILOR:
I think you look amazing.

05:32.682 --> 05:34.183
I'll take it.

05:34.225 --> 05:35.518
- Great.
- No, no.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.480
The compliment, not the shirt.

05:38.521 --> 05:40.774
NARRATOR: <i>And so it was</i>
<i>a very worried George Michael</i>

05:40.816 --> 05:44.235
<i>that arrived to speak to</i>
<i>his uncle at the Gothic Castle,</i>

05:44.277 --> 05:46.195
<i>which, that night,</i>
<i>did actually kind of resemble</i>

05:46.237 --> 05:47.489
<i>the Gothicassle.</i>

05:47.530 --> 05:49.699
- Uncle Gob.
- Don't call me Unc...

05:49.741 --> 05:51.200
Actually, no, that's good,
that works here.

05:51.242 --> 05:52.910
Is my dad upset?
What's going on?

05:52.952 --> 05:54.704
- No, he's fine.
- But you told me he was really upset

05:54.746 --> 05:56.539
- about something.
- I don't know.

05:56.581 --> 05:58.916
I do know that your daddy
wants you to get

05:58.958 --> 06:00.293
your hot, little, tight,
little, hot ass

06:00.335 --> 06:02.128
right up there right away
to see him.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.005
- BOUNCER: You're good.
- You, you had me come all the way here

06:04.046 --> 06:05.674
just to tell me
my dad wants me to meet him?

06:05.715 --> 06:07.509
No, no, those two things
are unrelated.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.594
No, I'm, I'm here 'cause
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony

06:09.636 --> 06:11.095
into this gay magic trick,

06:11.137 --> 06:13.515
and I just needed
a believable arm candy bean.

06:13.556 --> 06:15.558
And don't make that face;
you look homophobic.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.352
- No, I'm not being homophobic.
- Why are you doing this?

06:17.393 --> 06:19.103
- I'm, I'm uncomfortable.
- This is very important for me.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.986
Don't worry, you're blending in
here perfectly.

06:21.022 --> 06:21.939
A newbie.

06:21.981 --> 06:23.983
(chuckles)
Except,

06:24.025 --> 06:25.443
even if he does post that
somewhere,

06:25.485 --> 06:26.778
the Fakeblock thing
will scrub it away.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.571
You know about Fakeblock?

06:28.613 --> 06:30.532
You know, that's my software.

06:30.573 --> 06:32.617
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

06:32.659 --> 06:34.661
because that's starting
to take off now.

06:34.703 --> 06:36.830
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know that your dad

06:36.872 --> 06:38.874
is really, really,
really upset with you.

06:38.915 --> 06:40.709
He is upset?
I asked you that.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.002
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

06:43.044 --> 06:44.880
You're giving me these craz...

06:44.921 --> 06:46.422
- Mad?
- N...

06:46.464 --> 06:48.299
- God, what is that inky taste?
- It's my stamp.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.926
- Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
- No, that-that's okay.

06:49.967 --> 06:52.178
I probably won't come back in.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.180
I-I'm gonna go see my dad.

06:54.222 --> 06:55.932
Yeah, you are
'cause you're a good son.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.560
Ow!

06:58.601 --> 07:00.520
- Bit my tongue, that little bitch.
<i>- Oh, no, he didn't.</i>

07:00.562 --> 07:02.856
- They're always doing that.
<i>- I mean, oh, no, he didn't.</i>

07:02.898 --> 07:05.149
Thank you, George Michael;
honestly I owe you big-time.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.276
Not a lot of nephews
would do this for their uncles.

07:07.318 --> 07:08.528
Now get out of here.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.739
I never want to sleep
with you again.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.407
I mean, I probably will.
(whispers): I don't.

07:12.448 --> 07:13.867
But are we good?

07:13.909 --> 07:15.549
- We're good.
<i>- After successfully looking</i>

07:15.577 --> 07:17.746
<i>like he'd had a fight</i>
<i>with his boyfriend,</i>

07:17.787 --> 07:20.623
<i>Gob put his plan into action.</i>

07:20.665 --> 07:23.376
Knowing that Tony would go
into the closet

07:23.418 --> 07:25.336
and pop out of somewhere else,

07:25.378 --> 07:28.256
Gob proceeded to lock
everything he could find.

07:31.008 --> 07:33.219
Who's the dumbwaiter now?

07:33.261 --> 07:35.179
NARRATOR: <i>And that's when he saw</i>
<i>something that took him</i>

07:35.221 --> 07:39.141
<i>back to a moment when his life</i>
<i>had reached its nadir.</i>

07:40.977 --> 07:43.187
MAN: <i>You know,</i>
<i>if tomorrow you won't open up</i>

07:43.229 --> 07:46.858
<i>and let someone else in, then</i>
<i>the treasures you have inside</i>

07:46.900 --> 07:49.360
<i>may never come out.</i>

07:49.402 --> 07:52.697
(fast-tempo, electronic
dance music begins)

07:52.739 --> 07:55.074
TONY:
A magician has many secrets...

07:55.116 --> 07:56.451
(audience cheering, whistling)

07:56.492 --> 07:58.787
...but there was one I was
forced to keep...

07:58.828 --> 08:01.998
by society.

08:02.039 --> 08:05.961
NARRATOR: <i>And Gob settled in</i>
<i>to watch his revenge play out.</i>

08:06.002 --> 08:09.505
TONY:
"Don't talk to us," they said.

08:09.547 --> 08:13.009
"Keep your hands to yourself,"
they also said.

08:15.219 --> 08:17.430
Magic is only for straight men.

08:19.724 --> 08:22.226
(police siren wailing)

08:22.268 --> 08:25.187
(audience shouting, whooping)

08:25.229 --> 08:27.941
TONY: I don't want
to look at you, son.

08:27.983 --> 08:29.150
Just go to work.

08:29.191 --> 08:32.988
Why can't you be
like your brother?

08:36.323 --> 08:38.618
There! Stay in there!

08:38.659 --> 08:40.285
- (audience groans)
- We don't want you out here!

08:40.328 --> 08:45.041
Well, I'm here,
I'm queer, and now...

08:45.082 --> 08:47.293
I'm in a chair!

08:47.335 --> 08:49.712
- Did somebody say Wonder?
- (audience cheering)

08:49.754 --> 08:51.339
NARRATOR:
<i>Nobody actually did that time,</i>

08:51.380 --> 08:53.174
<i>but I think</i>
<i>he got away with it.</i>

08:53.215 --> 08:55.760
Didn't expect to see you here.
Want to get a drink later?

08:55.802 --> 08:58.179
<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>it was this trick...</i>

08:58.220 --> 08:59.848
Now everybody's gay!

08:59.889 --> 09:02.266
<i>...that really brought</i>
<i>the crowd to their feet.</i>

09:02.308 --> 09:05.728
<i>Although it was pretty easy</i>
<i>to figure out how he did it.</i>

09:05.770 --> 09:07.188
<i>They started out gay.</i>

09:07.229 --> 09:09.106
You missed your cue!

09:09.148 --> 09:11.275
<i>Gob was having a drink</i>
<i>with a man</i>

09:11.317 --> 09:13.069
<i>he'd twice tried to sabotage.</i>

09:13.110 --> 09:16.531
Beanbag chair-- I was wondering
what you were gonna pop out of.

09:16.572 --> 09:18.033
Did somebody say Wonder...

09:18.074 --> 09:19.701
...ing?

09:19.742 --> 09:21.995
I always try to stay one step
ahead of the audience.

09:22.037 --> 09:23.038
<i>Vamanos!</i>

09:25.665 --> 09:27.834
Oh, hey, come on, man.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.168
Timing, right?

09:29.210 --> 09:30.294
Hey, leave the mask.

09:30.336 --> 09:31.546
Yeah, of course-- mask.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.881
Yeah, that makes sense.

09:32.922 --> 09:34.549
I use a mask myself, in my act.

09:34.590 --> 09:37.218
But you have to tell me how
you do that bean bag trick.

09:37.259 --> 09:39.261
Well, I guess,
since you're a magician, too.

09:39.303 --> 09:40.388
But not a word of this.

09:40.429 --> 09:42.598
(whispering):
I did use a mask.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.808
I put it on another guy,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.250
and then I was
in the bean bag chair

09:45.267 --> 09:46.310
the whole time.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.896
Oh, well, that's... that's...

09:47.937 --> 09:49.605
(whispering): ...that's why
they put that sign

09:49.647 --> 09:51.649
on the bean bag chair that says,
"Do not steal this..."

09:51.691 --> 09:53.526
<i>And the magicians</i>
<i>shared the secrets</i>

09:53.568 --> 09:55.361
<i>of their ancient</i>
<i>and mystical craft.</i>

09:55.403 --> 09:57.321
TONY (whispering): And also
it's very hard to get out of

09:57.363 --> 09:59.198
(normal volume):
at the end, when I appear.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.658
So how have you been?

10:00.700 --> 10:03.411
I haven't seen you
since your "wedding,"

10:03.452 --> 10:04.913
when you did the Jesus gag.

10:04.954 --> 10:06.873
See, it's like a quotation mark,
but with a "W."

10:06.915 --> 10:08.374
Oh, yeah, right, I got ya.

10:08.416 --> 10:10.085
That's... I should do that.

10:10.126 --> 10:11.210
Hey, don't. Okay?

10:11.252 --> 10:13.546
I-I... I won't.

10:13.588 --> 10:16.007
Yeah, uh, no, the marriage
was unsuccessful.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.052
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

10:19.094 --> 10:20.887
Well, makes sense now,
doesn't it?

10:20.929 --> 10:22.097
What do you mean?

10:22.138 --> 10:23.180
Well, I mean,
you are gay, right?

10:23.222 --> 10:25.058
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.476
Very... because of
what I'm... dressed...

10:27.518 --> 10:28.937
And my boyfriend
was here earlier.

10:28.978 --> 10:30.396
And-and he bit my tongue.

10:30.438 --> 10:32.189
<i>And that's when Gob did</i>

10:32.231 --> 10:33.524
<i>a magic trick of his own.</i>

10:33.566 --> 10:35.276
- Want to see?
- No, I believe you.

10:35.317 --> 10:36.569
I'm just surprised, though,

10:36.611 --> 10:38.613
because you are
the Christian magician.

10:38.654 --> 10:40.990
Although you did look awfully
shredded on that cross.

10:41.032 --> 10:42.408
You should have seen me

10:42.450 --> 10:43.952
when they took me
out of the storage locker.

10:43.993 --> 10:46.871
- Hmm.
- But how'd I get in the storage locker?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.289
That's okay;
I know it didn't work.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.916
Made the "Woops" column
in <i>Poof.</i>

10:49.958 --> 10:52.085
<i>It's cool, though, man;</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

10:52.127 --> 10:53.252
<i>Your assistant probably</i>
<i>sabotaged you.</i>

10:53.294 --> 10:54.796
I don't even use one anymore.

10:54.837 --> 10:55.964
I resorted to using my own legs

10:56.005 --> 10:57.673
in the
"Saw the Lady in Half" gag.

10:57.715 --> 10:58.967
I even shaved them.

10:59.008 --> 11:01.218
Want to feel?

11:01.260 --> 11:02.470
Wow, they are smooth.

11:02.511 --> 11:04.305
Like a lady's.

11:04.346 --> 11:05.974
I think.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.600
(laughing)

11:07.642 --> 11:09.310
You're funny.

11:09.351 --> 11:11.146
- Too bad we can't do this more.
- Why?

11:11.187 --> 11:12.354
I don't know if it'd be

11:12.396 --> 11:13.773
great for my reputation
to be seen

11:13.815 --> 11:15.900
with the fundamentalist
Christian magician.

11:15.942 --> 11:19.487
<i>And he was suspicious that Gob</i>
<i>might not actually be gay.</i>

11:19.528 --> 11:21.906
MAN: Valet is closing.
The Cabriolet--

11:21.948 --> 11:24.575
- license plate: "ANUS TART."
- That's me.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.452
Aw, what the hell, let's do it.

11:26.494 --> 11:29.497
<i>And that's when Gob came up</i>
<i>with a new revenge plan.</i>

11:29.538 --> 11:30.915
Yeah, let's risk it.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.083
Right? Let's risk it!

11:32.125 --> 11:33.584
Come on.

11:35.252 --> 11:39.882
<i>The next day, Gob shared</i>
<i>his new plan with Tobias.</i>

11:39.924 --> 11:41.258
Good. Seems like
you're done talking.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.927
I, too, am in a relationship,

11:42.969 --> 11:45.596
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.974
Plan on making this person
fall in love with me

11:48.016 --> 11:50.601
and then destroying them
by breaking their heart.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.353
How do you make someone
fall in love with you?

11:52.394 --> 11:54.396
- Can you pass the mustard, please?
- Yeah.

11:54.438 --> 11:56.024
Oh, it's easy when
you've got so much in common.

11:56.065 --> 11:57.525
Last night, for instance,

11:57.566 --> 11:59.027
we both got a case
of the munchies,

11:59.068 --> 12:00.987
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

12:01.029 --> 12:05.033
<i>As it turns out, they did</i>
<i>a lot more than steal pies.</i>

12:05.074 --> 12:08.870
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

12:08.911 --> 12:10.329
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

12:10.371 --> 12:11.706
we made those
at "Color Me Mine,"

12:11.747 --> 12:13.208
and I know they're
kind of cockeyed,

12:13.249 --> 12:15.168
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.294
Sounds like you're really
into this girl.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.047
Don't call me girl, friend.

12:19.088 --> 12:20.923
No, this is purely
an act of revenge,

12:20.965 --> 12:23.218
filled with white-hot hate.

12:23.259 --> 12:26.054
I'd tell you on who, but this
person is sort of a celebrity.

12:26.095 --> 12:27.138
Oh!

12:27.180 --> 12:29.306
Well, turns out my femme fatale

12:29.348 --> 12:30.725
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

12:30.766 --> 12:32.560
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Gob found a solution</i>

12:32.601 --> 12:34.436
<i>to filling one of the houses.</i>

12:34.478 --> 12:36.022
...I've been looking
for a place to live.

12:36.064 --> 12:37.565
That's great.
When can you move in?

12:37.606 --> 12:39.275
Uh, duh! Now!

12:39.316 --> 12:41.944
Oh, the other sex offenders
are going to be so jealous.

12:41.986 --> 12:44.780
Wait a minute...

12:44.822 --> 12:47.867
you know of other people
with similar needs?

12:47.909 --> 12:49.702
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he filled the rest.</i>

12:49.744 --> 12:51.453
Oh, I have a list of men

12:51.495 --> 12:54.040
that could fill
every opening you have.

12:54.082 --> 12:56.333
(coughing)

12:56.375 --> 12:58.419
(laughs, coughs)

12:59.670 --> 13:00.838
Let me get a shot of mustard.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.882
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

13:02.924 --> 13:04.633
<i>Not wanting</i>
<i>to appear desperate,</i>

13:04.675 --> 13:08.345
<i>Gob waited till late afternoon</i>
<i>to continue his plan</i>

13:08.387 --> 13:10.056
<i>to make Tony</i>
<i>fall in love with him.</i>

13:10.098 --> 13:11.807
TONY (recorded):
It's Tony.

13:11.849 --> 13:15.394
I'm not here right now,
because I'm right behind you.

13:15.436 --> 13:17.146
Made you look.

13:17.188 --> 13:18.689
But how did I know you looked?

13:18.731 --> 13:20.316
Because I'm right behind you!

13:22.484 --> 13:24.195
Made you look again.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.487
Tony, it's Gob.

13:25.529 --> 13:27.865
Man, does anybody
ever fall for that?

13:27.907 --> 13:31.035
Listen, uh, I was just,
I was thinking about you--

13:31.077 --> 13:33.079
what a fun night
we had the other night.

13:33.121 --> 13:35.164
So just call me
when you get a chance.

13:35.206 --> 13:37.125
Okay? All right.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.127
(ringtone plays)

13:39.168 --> 13:40.211
Wow, that was fast,
you hot little...

13:40.253 --> 13:41.921
- It's your mother.
- Hi.

13:41.963 --> 13:43.756
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

13:43.798 --> 13:46.092
I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm
dating someone famous.

13:46.134 --> 13:48.677
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was given a new job.</i>

13:48.719 --> 13:50.679
You better start
to build this wall, pronto.

13:50.721 --> 13:53.308
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

13:53.349 --> 13:55.310
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was told to make it</i>

13:55.351 --> 13:57.145
(with Lucille):
<i>...look like major construction</i>

13:57.186 --> 13:58.437
<i>had begun on the wall.</i>

13:58.479 --> 14:01.649
<i>So Gob set out to find a crew.</i>

14:01.690 --> 14:03.192
(men shouting)

14:03.234 --> 14:06.403
- (feedback screeching)
- Who wants to... (screaming)

14:06.445 --> 14:07.696
Hurt my ears.

14:07.738 --> 14:10.325
Who wants
to help me build a wall...

14:10.366 --> 14:12.743
to keep Mexicans out of America?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.536
(bleep)
All right, all right!

14:14.578 --> 14:15.621
(men shouting in Spanish)

14:15.663 --> 14:17.081
Who wants to help me

14:17.123 --> 14:18.457
build a wall for no reason?

14:18.499 --> 14:20.417
It's a different wall.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.460
(men shouting, cursing)

14:21.502 --> 14:23.629
- (bleep)
- (men shouting angrily)

14:23.671 --> 14:24.964
(bleep)

14:25.006 --> 14:26.090
(Gob shouting,
feedback screeching)

14:26.132 --> 14:28.509
Aah! This thing is loud!

14:28.550 --> 14:31.137
<i>And so he decided to head</i>
<i>to the border ribbon</i>

14:31.179 --> 14:32.972
<i>to put in some</i>
<i>manual labor himself.</i>

14:33.014 --> 14:34.431
GOB: ...show everyone
that I'm not afraid of

14:34.473 --> 14:37.559
the sweet sting of sweat
in my eyes.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.105
<i>...when he came across</i>
<i>a local maca picker.</i>

14:41.147 --> 14:43.107
You need help to make
your sign stand up?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.733
Yes. No!

14:44.775 --> 14:47.278
I need to find some Mexicans
to help build this wall.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.737
Hey, you know what?

14:48.779 --> 14:49.947
You should get the Chinese
to build your wall.

14:49.989 --> 14:50.948
We make great walls.

14:50.990 --> 14:51.949
That would be great.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.284
How can we make that happen?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.410
I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese.

14:54.451 --> 14:55.786
I hook you up.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.163
- Well, that's, uh...
- (ringtone playing)

14:57.205 --> 14:58.873
That'd be... great.

14:58.914 --> 15:00.457
Would you get off
my (bleep), Mother!

15:00.499 --> 15:02.793
Well, if I wasn't sure
you were gay, I am now.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.087
It's Tony. Hey, Tony.

15:05.129 --> 15:06.672
Sorry I couldn't
talk last night,

15:06.714 --> 15:09.217
but, uh, I'd really love
to get together later.

15:09.258 --> 15:11.593
This week,
or maybe Saturday, say, 5:00?

15:11.635 --> 15:13.262
- Great.
- I'm thinking Little Ballroom.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.556
Little Ballroom good?
Or you sick of Little Ballroom?

15:15.597 --> 15:18.226
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.810
That was Tony.
My friend Tony.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.021
Oh, she sounds wonderful.

15:22.063 --> 15:24.606
No... no...
I'm gonna get revenge on him

15:24.648 --> 15:26.359
and destroy his life.

15:26.401 --> 15:27.776
Her life.

15:27.818 --> 15:30.112
Our... life.

15:30.154 --> 15:32.240
Destroy our life.

15:33.241 --> 15:34.616
Destroy our life.

15:34.658 --> 15:36.077
That doesn't matter.
Who cares?

15:36.118 --> 15:38.413
<i>But Tony Wonder</i>
<i>had a secret, too.</i>

15:38.454 --> 15:39.914
We're on.

15:39.955 --> 15:41.832
And he definitely thinks
you're gay, right?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.500
Don't worry, the only thing I'm
better at than (bleep)-ing women

15:43.542 --> 15:45.420
is pretending I'm gay.

15:45.461 --> 15:47.255
Trust me, I am all man.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.257
Give me a little leg shave?

15:49.298 --> 15:50.859
All right, well,
you have to be careful.

15:50.883 --> 15:51.884
If Gob finds out
you're straight,

15:51.926 --> 15:53.677
he'll use it to ruin you,

15:53.719 --> 15:56.847
and I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

15:56.889 --> 15:58.640
to re-brand you
as the gay magician.

15:58.682 --> 16:01.018
<i>It seemed Sally Sitwell</i>
<i>had a secret also.</i>

16:01.060 --> 16:02.686
I know that.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.105
Why are you telling me all this?

16:04.146 --> 16:06.399
'Cause if she finds out,
we both go down.

16:06.441 --> 16:08.161
And I don't want
to have to sell that closet

16:08.192 --> 16:09.944
as a sweat sauna on Craigslist.

16:09.985 --> 16:10.736
- Ow!
- Ooh. Sorry.

16:10.778 --> 16:12.321
It's fine.

16:12.363 --> 16:13.364
And as long as we're recapping

16:13.406 --> 16:15.199
things that we already know,

16:15.241 --> 16:16.575
an inside source tells me

16:16.617 --> 16:19.412
he's my ticket
to Internet billions.

16:19.454 --> 16:20.704
Inside source?

16:20.746 --> 16:21.622
Oh, I didn't tell you that?

16:21.663 --> 16:22.790
- No.
- That's new?

16:22.831 --> 16:25.709
It's "in the bag."

16:25.751 --> 16:28.170
<i>Tony made that sound</i>
<i>a lot cooler than it was.</i>

16:28.212 --> 16:29.255
That Fakeblock thing will
scrub it away.

16:29.297 --> 16:30.339
You know about Fakeblock?

16:30.381 --> 16:32.174
You know, that's my software.

16:32.216 --> 16:33.842
I wonder if my dad thinks...

16:33.884 --> 16:36.387
<i>It took a lot of restraint</i>
<i>for Tony to not pop out</i>

16:36.429 --> 16:38.097
<i>when he heard</i>
<i>the word "wonder,"</i>

16:38.139 --> 16:40.641
<i>but he was carried</i>
<i>into the audience</i>

16:40.682 --> 16:42.935
<i>before he could hear that Gob</i>
<i>wasn't actually gay.</i>

16:42.977 --> 16:45.187
TONY: I don't want some Spanish
guy sitting on me.

16:45.229 --> 16:47.022
<i>Once I get him alone,</i>
<i>I get into his phone,</i>

16:47.064 --> 16:48.607
get his boyfriend's information,

16:48.649 --> 16:51.360
hack into his software
and make a fortune.

16:51.402 --> 16:52.611
Ow!

16:52.653 --> 16:54.613
How do you not know how
to shave a leg?

16:54.655 --> 16:56.365
I've never done it before.

17:00.744 --> 17:04.248
Anyway, he's halfway to falling
in love with me already.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.876
I mean, he actually sounded
excited about seeing me tonight.

17:07.917 --> 17:10.796
Poor guy doesn't realize
I'm about to destroy our life.

17:10.838 --> 17:13.214
Our life?

17:13.257 --> 17:16.093
I mean,
destroy our life with Gob.

17:16.135 --> 17:21.265
Dest... I'm going to destroy
our life-- my life-- with Gob.

17:23.434 --> 17:25.685
("The Sound of Silence"

my old friend... ♪

17:29.357 --> 17:32.443
Destroy my life with Gob.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.488
Just be careful.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.698
Could be a house of cards.

17:37.739 --> 17:39.575
- (both yelling)

17:39.658 --> 17:42.119
- Caterpillar!
- Yep! There it went.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.246
That's exactly what that was.

17:44.288 --> 17:45.581
- Ow!
- Weird.

17:45.622 --> 17:46.665
Very weird.

17:46.707 --> 17:48.667
Caterpillar...

17:48.709 --> 17:52.087

Siri, where is
the Little Ballroom?

SIRI:
I have three matches.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.368
(mumbles):
I'm going to need the gayest.

18:22.410 --> 18:23.994
Did you say the "grayest"?

18:24.036 --> 18:25.704
(snickering)

18:25.746 --> 18:27.498
I need the, uh, gayest one.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.166
SIRI:
Did you say the "grayest"?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.529
I need the gayest

18:30.543 --> 18:33.170
SIRI:
Okay, Gob, try this one.

18:35.590 --> 18:37.966
I've got to tell Michael
that I saw another map car.

18:38.008 --> 18:39.676
He's gonna be blown away.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.512
GOB:
<i>You don't see them a lot.</i>

18:41.554 --> 18:43.180
<i>- Well...</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

18:43.222 --> 18:45.099
...looks like he's turning
into a parking lot.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.726
My Little Ballroom.
Of course, yeah.

18:47.768 --> 18:49.353
<i>She's got a kid,</i>
<i>he's acting like</i>

18:49.395 --> 18:51.146

18:55.984 --> 18:58.028
<i>at the wrong Little Ballroom.</i>

18:58.070 --> 18:59.405
I do not get this lifestyle.

18:59.447 --> 19:01.323
- Gob?
- You're mistaken.

19:01.365 --> 19:03.451
Hi, there.

19:03.492 --> 19:05.453
- Michael.
- Yeah.

19:05.494 --> 19:07.204
Well, look who's here: you.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.664
Where is she?

19:08.705 --> 19:10.165
First of all, that's very dated
of you, Michael.

19:10.207 --> 19:12.167
"He's" don't like
to be called "she's"

19:12.209 --> 19:14.253
and I don't who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

19:14.295 --> 19:15.546
No, no, no, it's a "she."
My girlfriend.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.880
That's who I'm talking about.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.424
Rebel. Rebel Alley.
Where is she?

19:18.466 --> 19:20.259
- Never met him.
- It's a she.

19:20.301 --> 19:21.885
Nice try.
Now what are you doing here?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.178
You gonna meet her here
with her son, maybe,

19:23.220 --> 19:24.305
so her son can play
in the ball pit?

19:24.346 --> 19:25.931
That's disgusting, Michael.

19:25.973 --> 19:28.053
- This is no place for a child.
- I know what you do.

19:28.058 --> 19:29.560
Mom told me
you were bragging about

19:29.602 --> 19:30.936
seeing somebody in showbiz.

19:30.978 --> 19:32.771
Then I see
a frozen dove in a freezer.

19:32.813 --> 19:34.523
That could be anything.

19:34.565 --> 19:36.191
It said "Love each other"
on the foot band.

19:36.233 --> 19:37.485
Yeah, that does
sound like one of mine.

19:37.526 --> 19:38.735
Whose freezer was it in?

19:38.777 --> 19:40.488
Rebel. Rebel Alley's.
Nice try, Gob.

19:40.529 --> 19:41.989
If I want to see bad acting,

19:42.030 --> 19:43.782
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

19:43.824 --> 19:45.242
<i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

19:45.284 --> 19:47.703
<i>He'd just forgotten</i>
<i>that he had met</i>

19:47.744 --> 19:49.413
<i>a still-partying Rebel Alley.</i>

19:49.455 --> 19:51.707
It's a little dove.
He's so cute.

19:51.748 --> 19:54.376
<i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

19:54.418 --> 19:55.670
(dove squawks)

19:58.213 --> 20:01.175
<i>She felt bad,</i>
<i>so quickly put it in a bag,</i>

20:01.216 --> 20:03.511
<i>wrote down the species</i>
<i>and location</i>

20:03.552 --> 20:07.055
<i>from which she'd acquired it</i>
<i>and then one further caution.</i>

20:08.890 --> 20:10.309
<i>It was a merry mix-up.</i>

20:10.351 --> 20:12.269
<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>knew any of this.</i>

20:12.311 --> 20:14.313
Honestly, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

20:14.355 --> 20:15.731
Yes, you do.
I got you dead to rights.

20:15.772 --> 20:17.399
Dead to rights!

20:17.441 --> 20:19.694
If ever we were gonna
have a fight, Michael,

20:19.735 --> 20:21.696
this would be
the safest place to do it.

20:21.737 --> 20:23.780
- Right! Let's do it!
- This gay bar would be the best...!

20:23.822 --> 20:27.034
...something that can fillet a
chicken and subdue an intruder.

20:27.075 --> 20:28.202
Let's do it!

20:32.122 --> 20:33.582
Back to My Little Ballroom?

20:33.624 --> 20:35.167
Yeah, this is the middle
of their workday.

20:35.209 --> 20:37.127
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

20:37.169 --> 20:38.879
You son of a bitch, Gob!

20:38.920 --> 20:41.382
You'll never catch me, Michael!

20:41.423 --> 20:44.552
♪ You raped and pushed
and struggled ♪

20:44.593 --> 20:45.636
♪ All those balls in the air... ♪

20:45.678 --> 20:48.681
You have to find me, Michael!

20:48.723 --> 20:51.099

20:51.141 --> 20:52.809

♪ Balls in the air. ♪

21:04.196 --> 21:05.989
Are we done?

21:06.031 --> 21:07.282
I'm just surprisingly tired.

21:07.324 --> 21:10.202
So tired... and so not hurt.

21:10.244 --> 21:12.454
Look, I'm not the guy, Michael.

21:12.496 --> 21:14.540
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.958
I filled all your...
your houses.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.126
Hang on-- filled 'em?

21:18.168 --> 21:20.087
Every last one of 'em.

21:20.128 --> 21:21.171
With who?

21:21.213 --> 21:23.924
With sex offenders.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.301
Hey! Hey!

21:26.343 --> 21:28.637
Gob, you're out of the movie!

21:28.679 --> 21:30.431
BOY: Thanks for ruining
my birthday party.

21:33.601 --> 21:35.936
NARRATOR:
<i>After fighting with Gob,</i>

21:35.977 --> 21:38.105
<i>Michael paid a return visit</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

21:38.146 --> 21:39.546
- What happened to your eye?
- Oh...

21:39.565 --> 21:41.191
Is that from Gob?
Was I right about him?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.277
No, actually.
Want to hear a funny story?

21:44.361 --> 21:45.862
You're out of the movie.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.197
Hold on, George.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.365
I beg your pardon?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.033
Did you say George?
Is that Dad?

21:50.075 --> 21:51.702
'Cause he's the one
who told me to hire Gob.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.370
I actually owe him a call.

21:53.412 --> 21:54.663
Hey, Dad, how you doing?

21:54.705 --> 21:56.498
Y-Yes, he did.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.750
With sex offenders.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.418
You want
to hear something funny?

21:59.460 --> 22:01.545
You're out of the movie!

22:01.587 --> 22:03.213
Want to hold for Mom? Yeah.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.674
Bye.

22:05.716 --> 22:09.720
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>

22:09.762 --> 22:12.848
<i>of the man he was still</i>
<i>hoping to con.</i>

22:12.889 --> 22:14.433
Hey, look...

22:14.475 --> 22:16.101
<i>Although he quickly</i>
<i>lost sight of that plan.</i>

22:16.143 --> 22:18.854
- You're mad at me.
- You stood me up.

22:18.895 --> 22:22.065
Oh, no-- Siri sent me
to the wrong "Ballroom,"

22:22.107 --> 22:23.984
and then I got in this fight
with my brother

22:24.025 --> 22:25.820
that didn't hurt,
it was just a whole...

22:25.861 --> 22:27.362
Oh, is that it?
Or is it because

22:27.404 --> 22:29.615
your boyfriend is 20
and I'm nearly twice that?

22:29.657 --> 22:31.659
You think that I care
that you're...

22:31.700 --> 22:33.327
three years older than me?

22:33.368 --> 22:35.412
No! I don't--
Check my phone. Check my phone.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.038
I don't need to check
your phone; come on in.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.666
<i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

22:38.707 --> 22:40.793
<i>contact information</i>
<i>out of that phone</i>

22:40.835 --> 22:42.878
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>for Tony's charade.</i>

22:42.919 --> 22:44.546
He hates me;
the whole family hates me.

22:44.588 --> 22:46.799
- Damn it!
<i>- Which he remembered too late.</i>

22:46.841 --> 22:48.216
Yeah, damn it!

22:48.258 --> 22:50.135
I mean, I even helped
fill his stupid homes

22:50.177 --> 22:52.680
with sex offenders,
and yet he still hates me.

22:52.721 --> 22:54.682
Sex offenders need
a place to live, too.

22:54.723 --> 22:58.435
Yes! Exactly!
That's what I always say.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.937
It's, like, God...
you get me.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.939
Well, you're an easy guy to get.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.733
I can't go home;
he's probably waiting for me.

23:04.775 --> 23:06.067
He's gonna be my boss?

23:06.109 --> 23:07.361
He's the younger brother.

23:07.402 --> 23:09.321
- How old is he?
- 42.

23:09.363 --> 23:10.698
Same!

23:10.739 --> 23:12.741
My younger brother's 42, also.

23:12.783 --> 23:13.784
Same!

23:13.826 --> 23:15.327
But...

23:15.369 --> 23:16.704
- I mean 32.
- Third... two...

23:16.745 --> 23:18.121
- 32.
- 32! Same!

23:18.163 --> 23:19.665
- Same! I was gonna say it.
- Same?

23:19.707 --> 23:21.792
- I was thinking the same.
- That's so weird!

23:21.834 --> 23:23.669
(both talking at once)

23:23.711 --> 23:25.880
- ...same.
- ...same.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.005
- Crazy!
- ...zy!

23:27.047 --> 23:28.089
Do you want a glass of wine?

23:28.131 --> 23:29.174
I love wine.

23:29.216 --> 23:30.676
- Red wine?
- I love red wine!

23:30.718 --> 23:31.802
- Same!
- Same!

23:31.844 --> 23:32.761
(laughing)

23:32.803 --> 23:34.012
It's, like, two same.

23:34.054 --> 23:35.639
- That's in-same.
- Totally in-same.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.683
<i>It turns out the guys</i>
<i>had tons in common.</i>

23:37.725 --> 23:39.226
- That's so weird.
- ...weird.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.977
- Like...
- Like...

23:41.019 --> 23:42.897
BOTH:
...the last... time I went...

23:44.064 --> 23:46.859
BOTH:
...scuba diving?

23:46.901 --> 23:48.861
- Wow.
- Wow.

23:48.903 --> 23:53.574
BOTH:
...eating... Captain Crunch.

23:53.615 --> 23:55.534
- Same.
- Same.

23:55.576 --> 23:57.118
<i>The hours melted away...</i>

23:57.160 --> 23:58.662
TONY:
I guess I must have been...

23:58.704 --> 23:59.830
<i>...and perhaps,</i>
<i>pretending to be gay...</i>

23:59.872 --> 24:01.540
...I don't know, 17...

24:01.582 --> 24:03.751
<i>...allowed them the freedom</i>
<i>to speak honestly.</i>

24:03.792 --> 24:05.627
...when I started saying "same."

24:05.669 --> 24:08.380
- Same.
- That's about the same time I got into magic.

24:08.422 --> 24:10.382
You know, I think I got into
misdirection 'cause I just...

24:10.424 --> 24:13.218
maybe I was trying to hide
my feelings or something.

24:13.260 --> 24:16.263
I was just doing it
to get out of gym.

24:16.304 --> 24:18.014
Who's Jim?

24:18.056 --> 24:19.099
No, I... phys ed.

24:19.140 --> 24:20.684
(laughs) Jealous!

24:20.726 --> 24:23.061
- Oh... kidding.
- (laughing): Right.

24:23.103 --> 24:24.521
(singsong):
Kidding.

24:24.563 --> 24:25.647
(both laughing)

24:25.689 --> 24:26.815
- Ooh!
- Oh...

24:26.857 --> 24:28.609
- Don't stop.
- Oh!

24:28.650 --> 24:30.444
Popcorn fight!

24:30.485 --> 24:32.613
(Tony coughing)

24:32.654 --> 24:35.031
(gagging)

24:40.495 --> 24:42.706
It almost went down my throat.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.833
(Gob sighs)

24:47.419 --> 24:48.921
I'll get some water.

24:48.963 --> 24:50.798
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just...

24:50.839 --> 24:53.091
NARRATOR: <i>And Tony had</i>
<i>another opportunity</i>

24:53.133 --> 24:56.804
<i>to get at Gob's phone.</i>

24:56.845 --> 24:58.847
<i>And chose not to take it.</i>

24:58.889 --> 25:03.018
<i>Gob also saw an opportunity to,</i>
<i>in some small way,</i>

25:03.059 --> 25:05.938
<i>sabotage Tony's act.</i>

25:07.355 --> 25:09.942
<i>And he also chose not to,</i>

25:09.984 --> 25:12.527
<i>although he did put the mask</i>
<i>down his pants.</i>

25:12.569 --> 25:14.696
Ah.

25:21.829 --> 25:24.080
(gulping loudly)

25:32.213 --> 25:34.424
BOTH:
Ah.

25:39.387 --> 25:41.556
We were really thirsty.

25:41.598 --> 25:42.933
Well, I guess I should get go...

25:42.975 --> 25:45.644
Yeah, I'd say stay,
but I just... I feel...

25:45.686 --> 25:48.229
I just feel like we should
take it slow, you know.

25:48.271 --> 25:49.731
Oh, same.

25:49.773 --> 25:52.693
I-I would definitely stay
and have gay sex with...

25:52.734 --> 25:54.319
or normal sex with you, but...

25:54.361 --> 25:57.781
Yeah, I would totally have
gay sex or whatever, but...

25:57.823 --> 26:00.158
just drank a lot of water,
you know.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.871
I-I just... I just had
a lot of water, too.

26:03.912 --> 26:05.539
Yeah, I don't want
to rush things.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.207
- Same.
- Same.

26:07.248 --> 26:09.167
You know, maybe we make
a date to do it

26:09.209 --> 26:11.003
another time,
and tonight we just...

26:11.045 --> 26:12.713
We can just sit and talk.

26:12.754 --> 26:14.798
<i>Gob had never said anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:16.800
That would be amazing.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.971
<i>And then he said something else</i>
<i>he'd never said before.</i>

26:21.013 --> 26:25.141
I have... feelings for you.

26:26.267 --> 26:29.730
I have feelings...

26:29.771 --> 26:32.066
for you.

26:32.107 --> 26:33.775
<i>The feeling was friendship,</i>

26:33.817 --> 26:35.861
<i>but neither had ever</i>
<i>experienced it.</i>

26:35.903 --> 26:38.947
<i>All they had to do now was</i>
<i>avoid making any specific...</i>

26:38.989 --> 26:40.532
Why don't we have normal sex
on Cinco?

26:40.574 --> 26:42.283
Let's have normal sex on Cinco.

26:42.325 --> 26:44.828
<i>I guess they figured they could</i>
<i>get out of it later.</i>

26:44.870 --> 26:46.538
<i>I'm not sure why</i>
<i>they said that.</i>

26:46.580 --> 26:48.040
- Same!
- Same!

26:50.667 --> 26:52.669
NARRATOR: <i>It was</i>
<i>the Newport Beach celebration</i>

26:52.711 --> 26:54.170
<i>of Cinco de Cuatro,</i>

26:54.212 --> 26:56.631
<i>and after taking care</i>
<i>of some business,</i>

26:56.673 --> 26:59.093
<i>- Gob ran into an almost ex-wife.</i>
- No, honey, on Cinco,

26:59.134 --> 27:01.302
we break the stick
and not the piñata. Okay, look.

27:01.344 --> 27:03.263
Whoo! Huh?

27:03.304 --> 27:04.723
GOB:
Well...

27:04.765 --> 27:06.349
- (chuckles)
- How long has it been?

27:06.391 --> 27:08.393
- It's been five years.
- What are you doing here?

27:08.435 --> 27:11.312
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

27:11.354 --> 27:12.898
I'm pretty sure
that's an adult...

27:12.940 --> 27:14.315
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

27:14.357 --> 27:15.442
<i>Oui.</i>

27:15.483 --> 27:17.903
What? We what?

27:17.945 --> 27:19.571
No, <i>oui.</i>
It's French for "yes."

27:19.613 --> 27:21.156
As in, "Yes, I have a son,

27:21.197 --> 27:23.658
and his father's a magician."

27:23.700 --> 27:26.661
(intro to
"The Sound of Silence" playing)

27:28.789 --> 27:31.708
(mariachi band playing
"The Sound of Silence")

27:31.750 --> 27:33.627
Oh. It's not us.

27:33.668 --> 27:35.253
Don't worry. It's not you.

27:35.295 --> 27:36.964
It was a real magician.

27:37.005 --> 27:38.715
He took advantage
of how angry I was

27:38.757 --> 27:40.467
when you wouldn't come out
of that cave.

27:40.508 --> 27:42.302
He promised me
a life together, and after

27:42.343 --> 27:44.846
he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

27:44.888 --> 27:46.723
I don't think
there's anything wonderful

27:46.765 --> 27:48.600
about Tony Wonder.

27:48.642 --> 27:50.268
Are you kidding me?
Are you saying...

27:50.310 --> 27:52.228
- Yes.
- Tony's straight?

27:52.270 --> 27:56.316
<i>Gob felt betrayed by a person</i>
<i>he was starting to trust,</i>

27:56.357 --> 27:58.234
<i>and he decided</i>
<i>to do something about it.</i>

27:58.276 --> 28:02.030
How would you like to spend
the night making revenge love?

28:02.072 --> 28:04.240
(sighs) Uh, Jacqueline,
could you, uh...?

28:04.282 --> 28:07.953
<i>With a plan to get revenge</i>
<i>on Tony Wonder taking shape,</i>

28:07.995 --> 28:10.080
<i>Gob met with Ann</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

28:10.122 --> 28:12.499
I'm ready, Gob.

28:12.540 --> 28:14.084
Yeah, okay, well,
don't get ready yet.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.670
Uh, Tony's not
going to be here for a bit.

28:16.711 --> 28:18.130
Tony?

28:18.172 --> 28:21.008
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

28:21.049 --> 28:23.593
Well, I-I thought
we were having sex.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.595
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.
(chuckles)

28:25.637 --> 28:28.264
Listen, here's the plan--
this house is wired

28:28.306 --> 28:30.767
with hidden cameras
from <i>Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

28:30.809 --> 28:34.062
There, there, there and there.

28:34.104 --> 28:35.856
We're going to destroy
Tony's career

28:35.897 --> 28:38.775
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

28:38.817 --> 28:40.819
while you're wearing...

28:40.861 --> 28:42.737
this Gob mask.

28:42.779 --> 28:44.489
Oh, and this little black
mini-robe.

28:44.531 --> 28:47.784
Just to really sell
that you're a man.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.494
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

28:49.536 --> 28:51.777
Because Tony's coming here
expecting to have sex with me.

28:51.788 --> 28:54.958
Look, in the act of having
fake gay sex,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.960
you're going to take off
the mask to reveal

28:57.002 --> 28:58.712
that you're having
real straight sex,

28:58.753 --> 29:00.922
destroying his career,
and it's all going to be

29:00.964 --> 29:03.050
captured on that camera
right there.

29:03.091 --> 29:05.426
I don't want to have sex
with Tony.

29:05.468 --> 29:08.096
Aren't you just a little cur...?

29:08.138 --> 29:09.430
I have a child with him!

29:09.472 --> 29:11.683
Okay, yes, new plan.

29:11.725 --> 29:14.519
I'm going to wear
this Tony Wonder mask,

29:14.561 --> 29:17.605
you're going to wear
the Gob mask, and...

29:17.647 --> 29:19.983
I am going to have sex with you.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.693
I'm sorry about all that.

29:21.735 --> 29:24.571
And then, again, you're
going to rip off the Gob mask,

29:24.612 --> 29:26.114
and the world will think
that he's straight,

29:26.156 --> 29:27.323
and it'll ruin his career.

29:27.365 --> 29:28.408
That's great.

29:28.449 --> 29:29.743
Much simpler plan, thank you.

29:29.784 --> 29:31.828
But the main event
is us having this...

29:31.870 --> 29:35.957
pretend gay
but actually straight sex.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.084
And you know what it is?

29:37.125 --> 29:38.418
It's a straight bait.

29:38.459 --> 29:40.087
I just realized,
it's a straight bait.

29:40.128 --> 29:41.504
You ever watch those?

29:42.630 --> 29:44.382
Good, and let me
have the room, yeah.

29:44.424 --> 29:47.969
I need a little while
to get same.

29:48.011 --> 29:51.223
To be the same.

29:51.265 --> 29:53.474
NARRATOR: <i>Downstairs, however,</i>
<i>Tony had arrived early...</i>

29:53.516 --> 29:55.393
Hello? Hello?

29:55.435 --> 29:57.812
<i>...and was looking</i>
<i>for a place to pop out of</i>

29:57.854 --> 29:59.480
<i>in case Gob said "Wonder."</i>

29:59.522 --> 30:02.150
- That piece of sh...
- ANN: Tony?

30:02.192 --> 30:04.903
Hey... you.

30:04.945 --> 30:06.238
It's Ann.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.240
Awfully funny time
to run into you.

30:08.282 --> 30:12.493
Yes, it is an awfully funny time
to see you, too...

30:12.535 --> 30:14.412
you.

30:14.454 --> 30:16.164
I know I owe you child support.

30:16.206 --> 30:17.958
Don't worry, I got
something big in the works.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.168
Actually,
that's why I came here.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.087
- What are you doing here?
- Gob invited me.

30:22.129 --> 30:24.380
He's planning
on getting revenge on you.

30:24.422 --> 30:26.591
(laughs)
He would never do that.

30:26.633 --> 30:29.970
Then why did he want to have sex
with me with this on?

30:30.011 --> 30:32.222
Wait a minute.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.266
Sex with you?

30:34.308 --> 30:36.268
Gob is straight?

30:36.310 --> 30:38.436
Oh, yeah, he is.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.023
- Tony?
- I just... Why would he do that?

30:42.065 --> 30:43.650
I thought he was gay.

30:43.691 --> 30:45.986
- Tony, you're not gay, either.
- That's business.

30:46.027 --> 30:48.155
Why do you think David Geffen
pretends to be gay?

30:48.196 --> 30:49.739
You think
the Shubert Organization

30:49.781 --> 30:51.407
would entrust a project
like <i>Dreamgirls</i>

30:51.449 --> 30:52.909
to a straight producer?

30:52.951 --> 30:54.702
How do you know so much
about <i>Dreamgirls?</i>

30:54.744 --> 30:56.624
'Cause it's my business
to know about <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

30:56.663 --> 30:58.456
And if you wanted to be
in a film version

30:58.498 --> 31:01.584
of a musical called
<i>The Magic Show,</i> done in 1974

31:01.626 --> 31:04.171
by another secretly straight guy
named Doug Henning,

31:04.212 --> 31:05.922
you'd make it
your business, too.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.299
I mean,
they can't give everything

31:07.341 --> 31:08.549
to Doogie Howser, right?

31:08.591 --> 31:10.635
Biggest fake gay there is,
by the way.

31:10.677 --> 31:13.305
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

31:13.347 --> 31:15.431
But it's big money--
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

31:15.473 --> 31:16.808
Fakeblock money.

31:16.850 --> 31:18.451
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

31:18.476 --> 31:20.436
I... I've been
overexplaining the (bleep)

31:20.478 --> 31:21.646
out of everything lately.

31:21.688 --> 31:23.106
You can't tell a soul.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.649
No one I know will care.

31:24.691 --> 31:27.194
Look, do you want
to out Gob as gay

31:27.235 --> 31:29.321
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

31:29.363 --> 31:31.698
- Yes, of course.
- Are you still your own legs?

31:31.739 --> 31:34.117
And do you have toenail polish
on you right now?

31:34.159 --> 31:36.870
Are you asking, am I wearing
any, or do I have any extra?

31:36.911 --> 31:38.705
Because the answer
to both questions is yes.

31:38.746 --> 31:41.208
Then we're covered.
You and I will have sex.

31:41.249 --> 31:43.751
And you wear this Gob mask, and
I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.212
Okay, I have two questions.

31:45.253 --> 31:47.297
One: Are you going to
move this time?

31:47.339 --> 31:51.051
And two: Why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

31:51.092 --> 31:54.637
I just thought that if you
had to have sex with a man,

31:54.679 --> 31:56.556
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on

31:56.597 --> 31:59.100
to have sex with someone
that looks like you?

32:00.518 --> 32:02.020
Okay.

32:02.062 --> 32:04.105
Put these on,
and then meet me in the bedroom

32:04.147 --> 32:07.150
in five minutes for some serious
secular intercourse.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.526
With myself.

32:08.568 --> 32:11.321
Yeah.

32:41.142 --> 32:43.019
GOB:
I should dim the lights.

32:44.437 --> 32:47.231
<i>And that's how Ann</i>
<i>not only performed</i>

32:47.274 --> 32:51.236
<i>a real-life version of Tony's</i>
<i>most beloved illusion...</i>

32:51.278 --> 32:53.071
Now everybody's gay!

32:53.113 --> 32:56.074
<i>...but was responsible</i>
<i>for the first reported instance</i>

32:56.116 --> 32:59.286
<i>of a Christian</i>
<i>straight-to-gay conversion.</i>

33:03.664 --> 33:06.918
<i>Gob went downstairs</i>
<i>to take a forget-me-now...</i>

33:06.960 --> 33:08.836
Is that you, Maria?

33:08.878 --> 33:11.839
<i>...when he bumped into a</i>
<i>brother who also had a secret.</i>

33:11.881 --> 33:14.050
GOB: We did make quite a mess
in that bedroom.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.885
- Michael.
- Gob?

33:15.927 --> 33:17.929
<i>And relished the opportunity</i>
<i>to rub it in.</i>

33:17.971 --> 33:20.640
Besides, you could not make me
feel worse right now.

33:20.681 --> 33:22.225
I'd be willing
to let you have your

33:22.267 --> 33:24.018
apology back if you give me
the chance to try.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.938
Bad example. If you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

33:26.980 --> 33:29.357
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

33:29.399 --> 33:30.775
something that you only
allowed to happen because

33:30.817 --> 33:32.527
you thought he was gay
and you were hoping

33:32.568 --> 33:35.322
to exact revenge, but then
you found out he was straight,

33:35.363 --> 33:37.740
then you wanted to get even,
so maybe you put a mask

33:37.782 --> 33:39.409
on someone and then tried
to convince yourself

33:39.451 --> 33:41.577
that the sex you were
about to have was with yourself,

33:41.619 --> 33:44.247
but it turned out to be him,
and all you ended up doing

33:44.289 --> 33:46.374
was proving that your feelings
were real...

33:46.416 --> 33:48.335
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

33:48.376 --> 33:50.586
- It's not that.
- I said, "Bad example."

33:50.628 --> 33:52.005
Hey, listen, Michael,
if you want,

33:52.046 --> 33:53.340
- we can split this.
- No.

33:53.381 --> 33:55.258
Believe me,
this is the last time I ever

33:55.300 --> 33:56.551
- judge you for anything
- (door opens)

33:56.592 --> 33:57.552
that you ever do.

33:57.593 --> 33:59.471
Oh, (bleep).

33:59.513 --> 34:01.973
Is that who you were with?

34:02.015 --> 34:04.392
<i>And Gob decided to be generous</i>

34:04.434 --> 34:06.853
<i>- with his last forget-me-now...</i>
- (grunting): No!

34:06.894 --> 34:09.063
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>it was Michael</i>

34:09.105 --> 34:12.150
<i>who forgot his shame,</i>
<i>and Gob who remembered.</i>

34:12.192 --> 34:14.110
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

34:16.737 --> 34:19.866
<i>Michael wakes up and is</i>
<i>reminded of something horrible.</i>

34:19.907 --> 34:22.743
FATHER MARSALA (over TV):
700,000. Think about it.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.329
That is a very big number.

34:24.371 --> 34:26.289
700,000 abortions every year...

34:26.331 --> 34:28.041
NARRATOR:
<i>The amount of money he owed</i>

34:28.081 --> 34:31.378
<i>because Tobias wanted</i>
<i>to mount this abortion.</i>

34:31.418 --> 34:33.629
♪ Fantastic Three,
Fantastic... ♪

34:33.670 --> 34:35.840
<i>And he does something that</i>
<i>he never thought he'd do...</i>

34:35.882 --> 34:37.551
LUCILLE 2 (recorded):
Vote for Lucille!

34:37.592 --> 34:40.011
- (beep)
- Hey, Lucille 2.

34:40.053 --> 34:43.014
I was hoping that
we could get together

34:43.056 --> 34:46.059
and talk about how I can
repay you that loan.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.768
<i>...and had already done.</i>

34:48.811 --> 34:50.938
<i>And then, with nothing</i>
<i>left to lose,</i>

34:50.980 --> 34:52.565
<i>he makes another call.</i>

34:52.607 --> 34:54.650
Rebel. Yeah, Michael.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.235
I need to come over.

34:56.277 --> 34:57.987
I'm... I don't want to act

34:58.029 --> 35:01.241
like it doesn't matter
to me anymore, 'cause it does.

35:01.282 --> 35:02.658
Well, there's somebody here
right now.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.035
I don't care.

35:04.077 --> 35:05.579
The thing with
the other guy, it's...

35:05.620 --> 35:07.372
you know, that's over,
so we don't...

35:07.414 --> 35:09.707
we don't ever have to talk
about that ever again.

35:09.749 --> 35:11.084
It's going away.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.045
Okay, well, you can
come over later, okay?

35:14.087 --> 35:16.506
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

35:18.466 --> 35:20.552
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Who was that?

35:20.594 --> 35:22.720
No one.
