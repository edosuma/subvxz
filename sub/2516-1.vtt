WEBVTT

00:51.699 --> 00:54.618
I am so fucked.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.455
I make one stupid bet with a
sociopathic Lithuanian kid

00:58.456 --> 01:02.209
and now my best friend's in
jail, my dad is a fugitive,

01:02.210 --> 01:05.045
they found a dead body
in my mom's trunk,

01:05.046 --> 01:07.881
the love of my life thinks
I'm the Antichrist,

01:07.882 --> 01:11.176
and I have crabs.

01:11.177 --> 01:14.053
But most shockingly...

01:14.054 --> 01:16.256
Mom?

01:23.188 --> 01:27.191
She wouldn't have gone anywhere.
We're fully stocked.

01:27.192 --> 01:30.486
Mom? Mom?

01:34.074 --> 01:38.370
Holy... shit.

01:42.916 --> 01:45.209
Is that a letter to her dog?

01:45.210 --> 01:47.461
911. What's your emergency?

01:47.462 --> 01:49.255
Yes, I'd like to
order an ambulance.

01:49.256 --> 01:51.590
- Location, please?
- 844 Marx Avenue.

01:51.591 --> 01:53.466
Oh, hey, Rick.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.593
Rick? Rick?

01:55.594 --> 01:59.722
I'm selling raffle tickets
to the Policemen's Ball.

01:59.723 --> 02:01.474
Is your mother home?

02:01.475 --> 02:04.060
Yes, but I think she's dead.

02:04.061 --> 02:06.354
- Step down, and...
- Got it.

02:06.355 --> 02:08.565
Alright, everybody, calm down! OK?

02:08.566 --> 02:10.316
This is a crime scene.

02:10.317 --> 02:11.860
Hold up one second.

02:11.861 --> 02:14.237
Let me get a picture
of this real quick.

02:14.238 --> 02:16.281
It's just a potential homicide.

02:16.282 --> 02:19.117
We better hurry in case
she's an organ donor.

02:19.118 --> 02:21.494
Don't make me hurt you.
What is the victim's name?

02:21.495 --> 02:24.956
Lucy Rebecca Stevens.

02:24.957 --> 02:27.041
- Date of birth?
- Uh, March something.

02:27.042 --> 02:31.588
- Old.
- Old. Education?

02:31.589 --> 02:33.171
My mom's deep-throating
a breathing tube

02:33.172 --> 02:35.299
and you wanna know how
far in college she got?

02:35.300 --> 02:38.594
Listen, we have a potential
homicide investigation here.

02:38.595 --> 02:42.055
A homicide? How do you explain
the myriad of suicide notes?

02:42.056 --> 02:44.474
- You can't have those.
- That one's addressed to me.

02:44.475 --> 02:46.435
- They're evidence.
- That one's addressed to me.

02:46.436 --> 02:49.435
Only if you let me
look at it first.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.018
Now keep back.

02:56.404 --> 02:58.113
What does 'opprobrious' mean?

02:58.114 --> 03:01.033
It means abusive or malevolent.

03:01.034 --> 03:02.993
Well, you're opprobrious,

03:02.994 --> 03:05.621
and you've been fucking
her best friend.

03:05.622 --> 03:09.041
How did she find out?
If Mom knows, who else?

03:09.042 --> 03:11.376
Billy would be pissed that
I was ploughing his mom,

03:11.377 --> 03:13.461
not to mention how his
dad, her husband,

03:13.462 --> 03:15.922
the ex-college football
player turned Neo-Nazi,

03:15.923 --> 03:17.465
sporting goods salesman

03:17.466 --> 03:19.675
who does a very good business
in shotguns might feel.

03:19.676 --> 03:23.971
More importantly, what if
Nina Pennington finds out?

03:33.607 --> 03:35.733
Enough about me, I wanna
see what this one says.

03:35.734 --> 03:38.361
- Now we'll hang on to these.
- Yeah, fine, fine.

03:38.362 --> 03:40.988
Until after our
investigation is complete.

03:40.989 --> 03:42.816
Alright.

03:44.034 --> 03:48.371
Oh, uh, about those raffle tickets?

03:56.963 --> 03:59.965
It was Mrs Bender. The
nut job told her.

03:59.966 --> 04:02.300
Of course, she left
out how it happened.

04:02.301 --> 04:05.804
I had no choice. It's kind of...

04:05.805 --> 04:08.306
It's kind of embarrassing,

04:08.307 --> 04:12.352
but here's how the
whole thing went down.

04:14.271 --> 04:15.897
I wager $1,000.

04:15.898 --> 04:18.649
Two weeks ago, I wasn't fucked.

04:18.651 --> 04:21.695
- You know Josh Groban?
- Not even close.

04:21.696 --> 04:26.324
Truth was, I had never had sex
with anyone other than myself,

04:26.325 --> 04:29.619
but this was the year I
was gonna change that.

04:29.620 --> 04:34.790
I had fallen in love and her
name was Nina Pennington.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.751
You forgot to put
the seat down, fag.

04:37.752 --> 04:40.922
It wasn't me. It was... it was Mom.

04:46.094 --> 04:49.763
Oh, for the love of
little baby Jesus,

04:49.764 --> 04:51.640
would you close those
goddamn drapes?

04:51.641 --> 04:53.851
Some people's moms look
at the glass half full.

04:53.852 --> 04:55.978
Other moms look at it half empty.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.647
Mine looks at it and asks
if you're gonna finish it.

04:58.648 --> 05:02.609
Mom, did you leave
the toilet seat up?

05:02.610 --> 05:05.279
Sorry?

05:06.406 --> 05:07.948
Where's your father?

05:07.949 --> 05:10.117
Uh... he moved out again.

05:10.118 --> 05:12.494
Right. Sonofabitch.

05:12.495 --> 05:16.497
You watch, I'm gonna
divorce him this time.

05:16.498 --> 05:20.126
Where were you last
night until 3am, madam?

05:20.127 --> 05:22.045
Uh, feeding the homeless.

05:22.046 --> 05:23.588
- Aww.
- Why do you always believe her?

05:23.589 --> 05:25.465
When I said I was giving blood,

05:25.466 --> 05:28.009
you told me I was full of
shit and grounded me.

05:28.010 --> 05:31.012
You didn't have any track marks
and watch your fucking mouth.

05:31.013 --> 05:32.555
And I got straight A's in school.

05:32.556 --> 05:35.475
And she got straight A's.
Have you heard from Agent...?

05:35.476 --> 05:38.644
Stanford, and no, I haven't
heard anything yet,

05:38.645 --> 05:41.439
but it should be any day now.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.524
You're a stripper, Kristen.

05:43.525 --> 05:46.527
With all the tips you make, why
do you even need a degree?

05:46.528 --> 05:48.488
Because I'm trying
to better myself.

05:48.489 --> 05:50.531
Why can't you be more
like your sister?

05:50.532 --> 05:52.492
Why would I want to be a skanky ho?

05:52.493 --> 05:54.576
- Mom, kill him.
- Can I?

05:54.577 --> 05:57.662
OK, so the whole thing
started Saturday...

05:57.663 --> 06:00.457
Joseph Stevens, my sperm donor.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.084
He stayed married to my mom

06:02.085 --> 06:04.044
because he couldn't
afford a divorce.

06:04.045 --> 06:06.171
If that isn't love,
I don't know what is.

06:06.172 --> 06:09.007
- What are you up to, mister?
- Nothing.

06:09.008 --> 06:11.051
- You are grounded.
- No.

06:11.052 --> 06:14.429
Unless you do me one little favour.

06:14.430 --> 06:17.057
And here I thought you came for
some quality father-son time.

06:17.058 --> 06:19.309
Remember that video camera
I borrowed last week?

06:19.310 --> 06:21.061
Oh, yeah, video camera,

06:21.062 --> 06:24.523
to videotape that sales
pitch with your secretary.

06:24.524 --> 06:27.234
Sales pitch. Oh, yeah,
yeah, sales pitch.

06:27.235 --> 06:29.319
Anyhow, I think I
left a tape in it.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.364
- Your mother didn't, uh...?
- Mom operate video equipment?

06:32.365 --> 06:34.448
She has a hard enough
time with the doorknob.

06:34.449 --> 06:36.951
- How is your mother?
- Do you honestly care, Joseph?

06:36.952 --> 06:38.953
- Not really, no.
- Steven.

06:38.954 --> 06:42.081
- Joseph wants his tape back.
- Twat.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.999
Thank you.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.669
And, the next time you borrow
the camera for a sales pitch,

06:46.670 --> 06:50.047
try not to leave any...
residue on the tripod.

06:50.048 --> 06:52.626
You are so grounded, mister.

06:54.094 --> 06:56.178
Grounded.

06:56.179 --> 07:00.307
OK, so the whole thing started
on Saturday, April 14.

07:00.308 --> 07:03.727
Unfortunately, this is
pretty much a true story.

07:03.728 --> 07:06.480
The names have not been changed
to protect the innocent,

07:06.481 --> 07:10.359
because, well, everyone in this
story is guilty of something.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.236
Speaking of guilty,

07:12.237 --> 07:14.154
I was running errands
for Jimmy Leach.

07:14.155 --> 07:17.991
He manages the club where
my sister, Kristen, strips.

07:17.992 --> 07:19.576
Yo, pussy!

07:19.577 --> 07:21.286
He also manages to be a total tool.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.496
I mean, look at that 'stache.

07:23.497 --> 07:25.957
Gotta be a registered sex offender.

07:29.795 --> 07:33.882
I need you to go find
Cherysh. She's MIA again.

07:33.883 --> 07:35.842
He didn't pay shit
but I could think

07:35.843 --> 07:37.510
of worse ways to spend the day.

07:37.511 --> 07:38.887
Are you still fucking here?

07:38.888 --> 07:41.347
'Bye, Tanya.

07:41.348 --> 07:45.768
Fuck off! Mmm. What day is it?

07:45.769 --> 07:48.563
It's Saturday.

07:48.564 --> 07:54.193
OK, uh... I will
give you a blow job

07:54.194 --> 07:57.029
if you tell him I had to
get my stomach pumped.

07:57.030 --> 07:59.823
Huh?

07:59.824 --> 08:01.825
Hm.

08:01.826 --> 08:05.037
I'm more a grower than a shower.

08:05.038 --> 08:07.991
Well, maybe this will
put you more at ease.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.836
OK, I know this is kind
of bad, but... again.

08:12.837 --> 08:17.463
Again.

08:24.432 --> 08:26.391
Less work for me.

08:26.392 --> 08:30.562
<i>♪ Then I could make
it safe and clean</i>

08:30.563 --> 08:34.148
<i>♪ Doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo
Oh... ♪</i>

08:34.149 --> 08:36.775
Billy, open up,
it's Rick. Hey, Billy!

08:36.777 --> 08:38.778
Ricky.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.113
Don't let the attractive
exterior fool you.

08:41.114 --> 08:42.698
She's dangerous.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.700
Now, I don't like to point fingers,

08:44.701 --> 08:46.869
but everything was
pretty much her fault.

08:46.870 --> 08:49.455
Well, except for the dead people.

08:49.456 --> 08:51.249
- Hi.
- Hi, Mrs Bender.

08:51.250 --> 08:54.329
- How are you?
- Good.

08:56.463 --> 08:58.214
Is Billy home?

08:58.215 --> 09:00.634
Yeah, he's probably
upstairs, you know...

09:01.593 --> 09:05.138
- OK.
- Hey, stay on the runner!

09:10.018 --> 09:11.898
Hey, Billy, guess what.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.856
Billy Bender... after he
flunked homeschool twice,

09:16.857 --> 09:19.276
the state made his parents
send him to a real school.

09:19.277 --> 09:21.361
Didn't help.

09:21.362 --> 09:25.907
Oh, Rick, I thought
you were my mom.

09:25.908 --> 09:27.781
Dude, it's called a lock.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.247
Oh, my god.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.506
Ah.

09:46.429 --> 09:49.052
Could you pass me a tissue?

09:54.269 --> 09:56.187
Thanks.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.393
No. No.

10:03.987 --> 10:05.696
- Dude, guess what.
- What?

10:05.697 --> 10:09.241
- I kind of got a blow job today.
- Shut up! From who?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.368
- A girl down at the club.
- A stripper?

10:11.369 --> 10:13.203
You better hope she
doesn't have AIDS.

10:13.204 --> 10:15.331
You really know how
to ruin a moment.

10:15.332 --> 10:18.000
I'm just saying. I saw
this documentary...

10:18.001 --> 10:19.877
Or maybe it was a movie?

10:19.878 --> 10:21.962
Anyway, it was called 'Rent',

10:21.963 --> 10:24.715
and everyone in it had
AIDS, and it sucked, Rick.

10:24.716 --> 10:28.927
- The movie or the disease?
- The movie.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.763
Mom!

10:30.764 --> 10:32.306
You boys are still here.

10:32.307 --> 10:34.849
Billy, I was wondering if you
could go down to the store

10:34.850 --> 10:36.559
and buy Momma some cigarettes.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.978
- Now?
- No, next Thursday.

10:38.979 --> 10:40.730
Now. Go.

10:40.731 --> 10:42.982
There's money in my purse, OK?

10:42.983 --> 10:46.069
Oh, Ricky, I was wondering if
you could stay and help me

10:46.070 --> 10:48.068
with something in the thing.

10:52.910 --> 10:56.746
He really has come in
handy since he turned 18.

10:56.747 --> 11:00.124
Can't wait until he turns 21.

11:00.125 --> 11:04.379
So... you had an eventful day.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.548
No more than usual, no.

11:07.549 --> 11:09.592
Billy told me you got a blow job.

11:09.593 --> 11:11.886
How? I literally just told him.

11:11.887 --> 11:15.472
Well, the point is that I know.

11:15.473 --> 11:17.599
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.685
Like, I said, "Kinda
got the blow job."

11:20.686 --> 11:23.772
Rick, your mom, my best friend,

11:23.773 --> 11:26.942
is going to find out if you
keep gallivanting around

11:26.943 --> 11:30.320
with these... these hookers.

11:30.321 --> 11:33.865
We're gonna have to come up
with some way to fix this.

11:33.866 --> 11:35.909
Could we just keep it a secret?

11:35.910 --> 11:38.870
Yeah, that's a good idea.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.580
Good.

11:40.581 --> 11:42.707
OK. Was she good at it, at least?

11:42.708 --> 11:46.878
Uh... I think so.

11:46.879 --> 11:49.714
It's just so good that you
came out of your comfort zone.

11:49.715 --> 11:52.008
- It's, uh...
- Yeah.

11:52.009 --> 11:56.679
It's very important to...
try new things.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.639
OK.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.600
And I just think that if you do,

12:01.601 --> 12:07.479
you need to experience them
in a, uh, safe environment.

12:10.402 --> 12:12.778
Whoa, Mrs Bender. Are you
trying to seduce me?

12:12.779 --> 12:14.905
No. My God, no, no, no, no.

12:14.906 --> 12:16.991
OK, I just thought that you were...

12:16.992 --> 12:20.744
No, I... I wanna be your teacher.

12:20.745 --> 12:27.501
Yeah, I'm going to help you
gain much needed experience.

12:27.502 --> 12:29.712
Do you have a girlfriend?

12:29.713 --> 12:33.507
Yes. No. Girlfriend?

12:33.508 --> 12:39.305
Well, one day you will, and you
owe it to her to be ready.

12:40.931 --> 12:43.892
- Sure.
- OK.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.936
Come here.

12:56.697 --> 12:59.115
Mmm. Does that feel good?

12:59.116 --> 13:03.828
It feels good. It
feels really good.

13:03.829 --> 13:06.123
You just raise your hand
if you have any questions.

13:08.459 --> 13:13.296
My God. It's also really nice
to pay attention to the girls.

13:13.297 --> 13:15.088
- To the what?
- The girls.

13:15.089 --> 13:18.383
Yeah. Gentle.

13:18.384 --> 13:21.762
Mmm... that's nice.

13:21.763 --> 13:24.056
Mmm. I like that.

13:24.057 --> 13:26.099
- Uh, Mrs Bender?
- Mm-hm?

13:26.100 --> 13:28.060
I can't breathe.

13:28.061 --> 13:30.605
Oh, it's OK, I'll
breathe for both of us.

13:34.317 --> 13:37.486
Sometimes you look at
your life and say,

13:37.487 --> 13:39.571
"I'm doing the best I can."

13:39.572 --> 13:42.533
Other times, you have to
look at your life and say,

13:42.534 --> 13:44.993
"I just fucked my
best friend's mom."

13:44.994 --> 13:48.539
But as I lay here the morning
after losing my virginity,

13:48.540 --> 13:52.251
all I could think about was what
everyone would say if they knew.

13:52.252 --> 13:54.796
You devil's spawn.

13:56.838 --> 13:58.923
Nice one, son.
I want to see photos.

13:58.924 --> 14:00.967
Does her pussy taste
like Seagram's?

14:00.968 --> 14:02.510
No, I mean, it makes sense.

14:02.511 --> 14:04.637
I mean, you guys hang
out, like, all the ti...

14:04.638 --> 14:06.931
Oh, my God, his mom?

14:06.932 --> 14:09.510
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:17.067 --> 14:20.319
You're a mother-fucker,
Rick Stevens.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.943
I will never be your girlfriend.

14:23.907 --> 14:26.450
Nina can't find out.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.703
I'm gonna ask Nina Pennington out.

14:28.704 --> 14:32.123
Right... you've had a boner for
her since the sixth grade.

14:32.124 --> 14:33.874
She still doesn't
even know you exist.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.750
Now's a good time to change that.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.753
Doesn't change the fact she's
still dating Kevin Carpenter.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.880
- Well, hello, gentlemen.
- Holy shit!

14:40.881 --> 14:42.882
OK, I should probably
stop for a second

14:42.883 --> 14:45.343
and give you the down-low
on Junior Dahmer here.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.220
AW, fuck it.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.799
- Hey, Karlis.
- So Nina Pennington, huh?

14:50.808 --> 14:53.560
She is pretty, isn't she?

14:53.561 --> 14:57.105
Don't you think you're setting
your sights a bit high there?

14:57.106 --> 15:01.276
No. I mean, why not? I'm not
missing a toe or anything.

15:01.277 --> 15:05.196
I like your bravado. It's cute.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.658
Tell you what, what say I make
things a bit more interesting.

15:08.659 --> 15:10.744
- Huh! Yeah, sure.
- Good.

15:10.745 --> 15:13.163
I wager $1,000 that
you will not be able

15:13.164 --> 15:15.497
to sign, seal and deliver
Nina Pennington.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.207
Nobody's delivering
Nina Pennington.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.751
- Sure I can.
- Fine.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.628
- Fine.
- By Arbor Day.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.422
Thanks for that unsolicited
stipulation, Billy.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.009
So, two weeks. Is that a problem?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.594
Nope.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.765
Shake it, Rick. It's
creeping me out.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.651
Oh, shit.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.854
You made a bet with
a mobster's son.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.577
Uh, a freshman just
got hit by a bus.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.280
- Oh, whoa.
- Again? Cool.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.125
Goddamn it. 1,000 bucks.
I'm a dead man.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.596
- What the fuck?
- Relax.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.933
- You're having a holy vision.
- Who are you?

16:16.934 --> 16:22.106
Saint Lola's the name. I'm the
patron saint of teenagers.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.899
Don't bother looking me up

16:24.900 --> 16:27.151
in the book of saints...
I'm unlisted.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.446
A saint? What are you doing
in the boys' bathroom?

16:30.447 --> 16:32.240
Old habits die hard.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.367
You kind of look like my mother,

16:34.368 --> 16:37.202
except with a camel toe.

16:37.203 --> 16:40.080
I get that a lot.

16:40.081 --> 16:42.040
Wait a minute, am I being punked?

16:42.041 --> 16:44.418
You're being poped.
I'm here to help.

16:44.419 --> 16:47.212
You're gonna help me score
with Nina Pennington?

16:47.213 --> 16:49.214
It's not quite that easy.

16:49.215 --> 16:50.882
The things we wish for

16:50.883 --> 16:52.926
are rarely the things
we need, Rick.

16:52.927 --> 16:55.512
So you're not gonna grant my wish.

16:55.513 --> 16:58.098
I'm not a fucking genie.
I'm a saint.

16:58.099 --> 17:00.350
I'm here to make the
path a little clearer,

17:00.351 --> 17:02.724
so you can make the right choices.

17:05.606 --> 17:07.148
What the fuck?

17:07.150 --> 17:09.068
Look for the signs.

17:14.449 --> 17:16.365
Attention, students...

17:16.366 --> 17:18.451
this week's Drama Club
production of 'Pippin'

17:18.452 --> 17:20.404
has been cancelled.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.623
Kevin Carpenter,

17:24.624 --> 17:27.792
the biggest fucking
asshole in the world,

17:27.794 --> 17:30.129
and Nina Pennington's
current boyfriend.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.756
We had every reason to hate him

17:31.757 --> 17:33.591
after what happened last spring.

17:33.592 --> 17:35.468
Billy passed out at
Greg Drubin's party

17:35.469 --> 17:37.011
and woke up the next morning

17:37.012 --> 17:39.430
with a condom up his ass
and fear in his eye.

17:39.431 --> 17:41.223
Kevin waited a week to tell him

17:41.224 --> 17:44.059
that it was a broom handle
that took his butt cherry.

17:44.060 --> 17:47.146
We are through.

17:47.147 --> 17:49.899
Bitch!

17:49.900 --> 17:52.359
A sign. Saint Lola was right.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.571
- Wait. Saint who?
- It's a sign from God.

17:55.572 --> 17:57.697
God wants me to be
with Nina Pennington,

17:57.698 --> 17:59.783
in every possible position.

17:59.784 --> 18:02.327
I've graded your exams

18:02.328 --> 18:06.164
and will be returning them
to you at the end of class.

18:06.165 --> 18:08.458
However, I doubt if
you'll want them.

18:08.459 --> 18:11.252
Miss Pennington got the only A.

18:11.253 --> 18:14.547
- Yes, was it an A-plus?
- No.

18:14.548 --> 18:18.218
And now who amongst us can
conjugate the verb 'vivo'?

18:18.219 --> 18:19.886
What's a verb?

18:19.887 --> 18:23.598
- Mr Stevens.
- Ah...

18:23.599 --> 18:26.768
Ah, OK, the conjugation of vivo.

18:26.769 --> 18:34.859
Uh, I believe that would
be 'vi', 'vive', V-V-V...

18:34.860 --> 18:37.069
Well, that was viv-awful.

18:37.070 --> 18:40.155
The correct conjugation
of the verb 'vivo' is...

18:40.156 --> 18:41.698
Strike one.

18:41.699 --> 18:44.868
..vivo, vivere, vixi...

18:44.869 --> 18:47.871
Victum...

18:51.668 --> 18:54.545
Principal Poole cancelled
classes that afternoon

18:54.546 --> 18:57.589
so we could each mourn
Mr Apgar in our own way.

19:08.643 --> 19:11.061
- Perfect timing.
- Huh?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.272
Attention, all students.

19:13.273 --> 19:15.399
All girls basketball players...

19:15.400 --> 19:18.776
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:18.777 --> 19:20.611
Hi, I'm Rick Stevens from...

19:20.612 --> 19:23.155
The slow kid from
Latin class, I know.

19:23.156 --> 19:27.535
Uh, yeah. Congratulations on the A.

19:27.536 --> 19:30.580
Thank you. Hopefully I'll
do better next time.

19:32.207 --> 19:35.042
I was just wondering
if you needed a ride

19:35.043 --> 19:37.336
to Mr Apgar's funeral.

19:37.337 --> 19:39.630
- You're going?
- He was like a father to me.

19:39.631 --> 19:41.799
I'm deep in grief
and shit right now.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.552
Who said that you could talk
to my girlfriend, douche bag?

19:44.553 --> 19:46.637
I'm not your girlfriend, Kevin.

19:46.638 --> 19:48.180
We always get back together.

19:48.181 --> 19:50.266
- You know that.
- Not this time.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.895
Rick was just asking if
I would accompany him

19:53.896 --> 19:57.645
to Mr Apgar's funeral,
and I said yes.

19:59.400 --> 20:04.654
Really? Well, a funeral is a
perfect place for you to be.

20:04.655 --> 20:07.032
'Cause you're a dead man.

20:07.033 --> 20:09.656
- Kevin...
- Fuck!

20:11.704 --> 20:14.532
So is that a yes?

20:17.126 --> 20:19.878
What? What?

20:19.879 --> 20:22.923
What? Nothing. Nothing.

20:22.924 --> 20:25.377
OK. 'Bye.

20:28.554 --> 20:30.639
I'm in.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.558
You're dead.

20:38.396 --> 20:43.525
I wasn't dead, not yet, but our
first date was at a funeral.

20:43.526 --> 20:47.572
In retrospect, that might not
have been one of my best ideas.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.950
That was a lovely service.

20:50.951 --> 20:55.156
Is it just me or did he
look more alive dead?

20:58.041 --> 21:00.376
<i>♪ From a higher window... ♪</i>

21:00.377 --> 21:02.461
- Ew.
- I love this song.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.921
Me too.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.881
My parents don't like me listening

21:05.882 --> 21:08.509
to a lot of pop stations,
due to all the satanic lyrics.

21:08.510 --> 21:12.137
But Mindy has a CD. When I go
to her house, I listen to it.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.889
I think he's so dreamy.

21:13.890 --> 21:15.432
And before I could stop myself...

21:15.433 --> 21:17.350
When he's in town,
I go to his concert

21:17.351 --> 21:18.935
and hang with him backstage.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.522
Wait, you know Josh Groban?

21:23.649 --> 21:25.358
Yeah, we're pretty tight.

21:25.359 --> 21:27.687
Then you must be going to
his show tomorrow night.

21:28.570 --> 21:30.905
Yes, of course. Ha! Yeah.

21:30.906 --> 21:32.824
I'd love to take you,

21:32.825 --> 21:35.284
but I know your parents
wouldn't let you go, so...

21:35.285 --> 21:37.620
Actually, my parents went to
Omaha for the world premiere

21:37.621 --> 21:39.706
of 'Christ on Ice',
starring Johnny Weir,

21:39.707 --> 21:43.001
and they're gone till Monday,
so they'd never know.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.253
Great. Great.

21:45.254 --> 21:47.630
- Strike two.
- This is so sensational.

21:47.631 --> 21:49.340
Uh-huh.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.300
I mean, it would really help me

21:51.301 --> 21:53.052
take my mind off things, you know?

21:55.431 --> 21:58.724
- Nina, are you alright?
- Your mom's gonna kill you.

21:58.725 --> 22:00.726
You better get their
insurance information.

22:00.727 --> 22:03.601
Oh, Rick. I'm stuck.

22:04.647 --> 22:07.524
What the fuck, dude?

22:07.525 --> 22:10.478
Hey! Seriously?

22:11.362 --> 22:13.613
<i>♪ I said bitch I'mma fuck you up</i>

22:13.614 --> 22:15.741
<i>♪ Get the fuck out my face</i>

22:15.742 --> 22:17.242
<i>♪ I'mma show you what the deal is</i>

22:17.243 --> 22:19.036
<i>♪ Bitch, mother-fucker... ♪</i>

22:19.037 --> 22:22.247
This totally reminds me of a
German porno I downloaded.

22:22.248 --> 22:23.874
Father Krumins?

22:23.875 --> 22:27.579
Richard. Oh, I am so sorry
about this slight mishap.

22:28.796 --> 22:30.547
Shouldn't we call the police?

22:30.548 --> 22:32.883
Miss Pennington, please
thank your mother again

22:32.884 --> 22:35.552
for hosting such a splendid
bingo night last week.

22:35.553 --> 22:39.302
I mean, her devilled eggs
were absolutely sinful.

22:40.515 --> 22:42.641
Shouldn't we call the police?

22:42.642 --> 22:45.519
I don't think that's necessary.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.064
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'd rather not report it.

22:48.065 --> 22:50.149
I'd hate for both our
premiums to go up.

22:50.150 --> 22:52.568
Plus, these sisters have
taken a vow of silence,

22:52.569 --> 22:55.196
so the fewer the questions
to answer the better.

22:55.197 --> 22:57.615
Don't worry, the archdiocese
will take care of everything.

22:57.616 --> 23:01.077
Peace out. Sisters? Better hurry.

23:01.078 --> 23:04.455
Should we call the police? Pfft.

23:04.456 --> 23:06.707
We pay you good money
to run this place.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.626
That is the best you can do?

23:08.627 --> 23:11.253
They look like they have
full-blown hepatitis.

23:11.254 --> 23:13.339
It's the morning shift.

23:13.340 --> 23:16.592
I mean, I'm working on putting
a breakfast buffet in here

23:16.593 --> 23:19.511
that will blow your
fucking mind, Vitolda.

23:19.512 --> 23:22.263
I'm talking about eggs and
bacon, whipped cream,

23:22.264 --> 23:27.686
sausage and a lap
dance, all in, $12.99.

23:30.773 --> 23:32.524
You girls suck!

23:32.525 --> 23:34.484
How many times have I told you,

23:34.485 --> 23:38.279
you won't draw a crowd if
you don't draw a bath.

23:38.280 --> 23:41.783
You make me sick. Get in
the shower. You, you're fired!

23:41.784 --> 23:45.120
- I don't work here.
- Wanna go out for some Korean barbecue?

23:45.121 --> 23:47.247
Ugh, oh, God.

23:47.248 --> 23:50.500
Cops have been on our ass,
so business has been down.

23:50.501 --> 23:53.837
That means receipts here
better go up, Jimbo,

23:53.838 --> 23:55.922
or you're gonna be out of a job.

23:55.923 --> 24:00.628
And probably a leg.

24:03.054 --> 24:06.765
Jimmy? Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy,
I need to ask you a favour.

24:06.766 --> 24:09.768
- Jimmy.
- Fuck off, will you?

24:09.769 --> 24:12.020
I need to talk to your
friend at the Paramount.

24:12.021 --> 24:14.064
- For what?
- I need backstage passes.

24:14.065 --> 24:17.943
For Josh Groban's concert tomorrow.

24:17.944 --> 24:21.488
Well, I really need Britney
Spears to lick my balls.

24:21.489 --> 24:23.532
No, wait, that wasn't it.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.034
Well, I need J.Lo to stick
her finger up my ass.

24:26.035 --> 24:28.120
No, that was my dad.

24:28.121 --> 24:31.206
You know what I need? I need
my poop chute bleached.

24:31.207 --> 24:34.251
- That's it.
- What? Look, I'll do anything.

24:35.295 --> 24:37.462
Anything?

24:37.463 --> 24:41.132
Seems Jimmy had a date too,
and he needed some ecstasy.

24:41.133 --> 24:45.720
The dealer was running a
buy-20, get-5-free sale,

24:45.721 --> 24:48.014
so I pocketed the extra pills.

24:48.015 --> 24:50.141
I don't want you getting
the wrong idea about me,

24:50.142 --> 24:52.268
but nowhere in the
Bible does it say,

24:52.269 --> 24:53.895
"Thou shalt not take ecstasy."

24:53.896 --> 24:55.646
That's true.

24:55.647 --> 24:57.648
With Lucy's car being
fixed by the archdiocese,

24:57.649 --> 24:59.775
I needed wheels to get
to Josh Graham's show.

24:59.776 --> 25:02.479
I can't believe I just said that.

25:03.989 --> 25:08.159
Mmm. Mmm.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.162
Mrs Bender, I'm gonna
need to ask you a favour.

25:11.163 --> 25:13.247
Anything. Anything at all.

25:13.248 --> 25:15.249
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.210
My car? Where are we going?

25:17.211 --> 25:19.502
I have to follow my
dad to catch him

25:19.503 --> 25:21.588
with his mistress for
my mom's lawyer.

25:21.589 --> 25:24.549
Only I can't have my mom find out,

25:24.550 --> 25:26.676
because she's liable to
do something violent.

25:26.677 --> 25:28.762
- You know how she is.
- Oh, yeah.

25:28.763 --> 25:31.848
Sure, that's very sweet of you.

25:31.849 --> 25:33.847
Yeah?

25:35.895 --> 25:37.729
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

25:37.730 --> 25:39.856
You want to show me how
much you appreciate it?

25:39.857 --> 25:41.942
Well, I'd better be going.

25:50.451 --> 25:52.528
If you want the car...

26:16.810 --> 26:19.229
Meow.

26:20.772 --> 26:22.815
Jesus, you scared
the hell out of me.

26:22.816 --> 26:24.900
That's the idea.

26:24.901 --> 26:27.528
What are you doing here?
If it's about the ecstasy...

26:27.529 --> 26:29.655
Relax, nowhere in the
Bible does it say,

26:29.656 --> 26:31.740
"Thou shalt not take ecstasy."

26:31.741 --> 26:34.660
- I'm more concerned with lying.
- But I really needed the car.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.662
The betting, the adultery,

26:36.663 --> 26:38.788
the not honouring thy
mother and father.

26:38.789 --> 26:40.748
OK, I get it. I get it.

26:40.749 --> 26:42.917
You're in quite the
pickle, aren't you?

26:42.918 --> 26:46.587
On the one hand, if you do manage

26:46.588 --> 26:48.798
to get Nina to succumb
to your advances,

26:48.799 --> 26:50.842
you'll have to deal
with her delusional ex

26:50.843 --> 26:52.844
with the rage issues.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.929
On the other hand,
if she spurns you,

26:54.930 --> 26:57.098
well, do you even have 1,000 bucks?

26:57.099 --> 26:58.891
You're not helping me here.

26:58.892 --> 27:01.436
Shouldn't you be telling me
how I should win her heart?

27:03.063 --> 27:05.231
Things are never that easy, Rick.

27:05.232 --> 27:09.652
Don't rush where you're going.
Otherwise you may never arrive.

27:09.653 --> 27:11.863
Oh, and one more thing.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.324
I know, the stealing.

27:14.325 --> 27:16.653
No.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.120
I'm going to Ibiza on holiday,

27:20.121 --> 27:22.205
so you're on your own for a while.

27:22.206 --> 27:26.206
Don't screw it up. Oh, and
look out for the Lithuanians.

27:32.508 --> 27:35.844
- I'm redecorating.
- I can see that.

27:35.845 --> 27:38.430
It's better, huh? More cheery.

27:38.431 --> 27:42.059
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, where's my car?

27:42.060 --> 27:45.395
Uh, Steven has it.

27:45.396 --> 27:47.481
As long as your asshole
father doesn't.

27:47.482 --> 27:49.900
- You watch, this time...
- You're gonna divorce him?

27:49.901 --> 27:54.905
You betcha I am. Fat fuck.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.907
Mrs Bender? Mrs Bender?

27:56.908 --> 28:00.576
Oh... Uh, hey, Mr Bender.

28:00.577 --> 28:03.412
I'm getting ready to go hunting.

28:03.413 --> 28:05.373
- Nice.
- Was he on to me?

28:05.374 --> 28:07.041
Did he know I was screwing his wife

28:07.042 --> 28:09.085
on their new Scotchgarded sofa?

28:10.629 --> 28:13.048
Oh, yeah.

28:17.761 --> 28:20.763
Hey, I thought maybe
Billy could come along.

28:20.764 --> 28:22.848
- No.
- You know, keep you company.

28:22.849 --> 28:24.642
And he'll bring his new camera.

28:24.643 --> 28:26.977
It's gonna be boring waiting for
them to leave the apartment.

28:26.978 --> 28:28.725
Well, Billy's used to boring.

28:30.649 --> 28:33.193
- OK, have fun.
- 'Bye, Momma.

28:34.986 --> 28:39.697
Hey, did you hear about
the new Latin teacher?

28:39.698 --> 28:41.741
He got killed in a
wreck on the I-40.

28:46.205 --> 28:49.040
- There's a reason they call
Latin the dead language. - Huh?

28:49.041 --> 28:51.543
Oh, by the way, we're not going
to Joseph's den of debauchery.

28:51.544 --> 28:53.461
Well, then where are we going?

28:53.462 --> 28:55.880
We're gonna go pick up Nina and
grab some backstage passes.

28:55.881 --> 28:57.841
I've got a date with destiny.

28:57.842 --> 29:00.009
As long as we don't
drive on the I-40.

29:00.010 --> 29:02.137
This is the place. Turn here.

29:02.138 --> 29:04.222
Ew.

29:04.223 --> 29:07.350
He said 8:30. We're just
a few minutes early.

29:07.351 --> 29:09.436
I can't believe I'm
about to meet Josh.

29:09.437 --> 29:11.855
I mean, this is the most
exciting thing I've ever done.

29:11.856 --> 29:14.275
I met David Spade once.

29:15.443 --> 29:20.112
Well, if it wasn't him,
it looked just like him.

29:20.113 --> 29:23.490
So... what are your
plans after graduation?

29:23.491 --> 29:25.409
I don't really have
any at the moment.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.703
That doesn't sound very wise.

29:27.704 --> 29:31.665
Oh, you meant plans? Like...
Oh, yeah, I have a lot of those.

29:31.666 --> 29:33.500
How about you, you have any plans?

29:33.501 --> 29:36.670
Oh, I'm gonna become a priest.

29:36.671 --> 29:38.922
I definitely have a calling.

29:38.923 --> 29:41.633
- And I'd call you out.
- What does that mean?

29:41.634 --> 29:43.427
Nothing, it doesn't mean anything.

29:44.804 --> 29:49.099
Hey, wait a second. I thought
girls could only be nuns.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.976
- Only ugly girls are nuns.
- That's not true.

29:50.977 --> 29:53.061
Yeah, that's not
true, Billy. Shut up.

29:53.062 --> 29:57.024
Don't mind Billy. He's...
missing a chromosome.

29:57.025 --> 29:58.984
So this priest thing, that's great.

29:58.985 --> 30:01.152
You sure you wouldn't
rather just be

30:01.153 --> 30:03.230
on 'American Idol' or something?

30:04.781 --> 30:06.991
It's 8:30.

30:06.992 --> 30:10.077
A priest?

30:10.078 --> 30:12.163
That means that she can't ever...

30:12.164 --> 30:16.209
- I know, Billy.
- You just kicked my mom's car.

30:16.210 --> 30:20.296
- Is everything OK?
- Yup, we're great.

30:20.297 --> 30:24.050
What if she sees that dent?
She's gonna kill me.

30:24.051 --> 30:26.511
She won't kill you if I
don't bring you home alive.

30:26.512 --> 30:29.514
Rick!

30:29.515 --> 30:32.016
She's gonna be so angry at me.

30:32.017 --> 30:34.477
Billy, shut up. Here it is.

30:34.478 --> 30:36.354
Jimmy, open up.

30:38.815 --> 30:41.191
Where the fuck is my shit?

30:41.192 --> 30:44.236
Here. My backstage passes.

30:44.237 --> 30:46.947
You want your backstage passes,
you're gonna have to take

30:46.948 --> 30:51.034
a good, long, hard look
at the ass, Cleaver.

30:51.035 --> 30:53.078
- What?
- Jimmy Junior.

30:53.079 --> 30:55.789
Do it, son.

30:55.790 --> 30:57.374
Then you'll give me
my backstage passes?

30:57.375 --> 31:00.544
Look at him, be a man.
Look at Ricardo.

31:00.545 --> 31:06.091
The vomiting cobra.
The meat monkey.

31:06.092 --> 31:08.885
- Do it, take a look.
- OK.

31:08.886 --> 31:10.762
Now you're a man.

31:10.763 --> 31:12.556
Can I have my backstage passes now?

31:12.557 --> 31:14.182
Let me grab those for you.

31:14.183 --> 31:16.351
Oh, by the way, go fuck yourself!

31:19.105 --> 31:21.272
That douche bag. Now
what am I gonna do?

31:21.273 --> 31:23.148
Dude, did you see his balls?

31:23.149 --> 31:25.693
Guys, come on. We don't
want to keep Josh waiting.

31:25.694 --> 31:28.862
- OK.
- Come on, come on.

31:28.863 --> 31:32.032
Hey, Rick, isn't
that your dad's car?

31:32.033 --> 31:33.826
Oh, shit, I think you're right.

31:33.827 --> 31:37.657
- Whose car?
- What's he doing here?

31:41.835 --> 31:43.586
Fuck me!

31:43.587 --> 31:45.671
Take that. Ride me.

31:45.672 --> 31:48.924
Oh, Joseph. Do me doggy style!

31:48.925 --> 31:50.676
That's Rick's dad.

31:50.677 --> 31:52.595
And your... mom?

31:52.596 --> 31:55.055
- Your pussy's so tight.
- Doubtful.

31:55.056 --> 31:57.975
I think this is what my parents
were trying to shelter me from.

31:57.976 --> 32:00.059
Are you ready for your turnkey?

32:00.060 --> 32:02.645
- Those are both our dads.
- Yeah, I'm pretty positive.

32:02.646 --> 32:04.772
I think I'm gonna
throw up. Oh, God.

32:04.773 --> 32:07.066
I think I have an idea.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.610
Fuck me! Fuck me!

32:08.611 --> 32:10.695
Vice squad.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.532
Oh, shit. Leave the dildo!
Let's go! Let's go!

32:14.533 --> 32:16.492
Oh, my God, go! Hurry.

32:16.493 --> 32:18.828
I'm getting in the
car, don't yell at me!

32:18.829 --> 32:20.413
Hurry up, let's go!

32:20.414 --> 32:23.124
Pamela's gonna kill me!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

32:25.502 --> 32:27.712
- Billy?
- Richard?

32:27.713 --> 32:29.797
- Shit! Shit!
- You stay, mister!

32:29.798 --> 32:31.799
Nina! Nina, come here, let's go!

32:31.800 --> 32:34.093
- You stay right there, mister!
- You are so grounded!

32:34.094 --> 32:35.970
- It was Rick's idea.
- What?

32:38.349 --> 32:41.099
So... what's your name?

32:41.100 --> 32:43.185
Nina.

32:43.186 --> 32:48.148
Nina? That's a pretty
name for a... pretty girl.

32:48.149 --> 32:50.567
Can I get you something, honey?

32:50.568 --> 32:54.363
Tea? Soup? An HIV test?

32:54.364 --> 32:57.658
These are brand-new Dockers.

32:57.659 --> 32:59.743
You know I puke when I'm nervous.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.662
What are we gonna do here? Hm?

33:01.663 --> 33:04.039
I didn't know anyone could run
that fast wearing a harness.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.333
Alright, cut the crap.
Excuse my French.

33:06.334 --> 33:08.126
How much do you want?

33:08.127 --> 33:10.045
As I see it... correct
me if I'm wrong...

33:10.046 --> 33:11.713
you'd like us to
forget you were here.

33:11.714 --> 33:13.882
We'd also like to
forget we were here.

33:13.883 --> 33:15.759
The only thing that's preventing us

33:15.760 --> 33:17.844
from falling into a
state of total amnesia

33:17.845 --> 33:20.721
is this little dent
problem we have.

33:20.722 --> 33:24.225
Now, if that just... went away,

33:24.226 --> 33:26.435
we could forget everything.

33:26.436 --> 33:29.605
- How you suppose we do that?
- Yeah.

33:29.606 --> 33:31.482
You'll say you ran
into Mrs Bender's car

33:31.483 --> 33:33.693
on the street outside
your apartment.

33:33.694 --> 33:36.445
Why would his wife believe her
car was outside my apartment?

33:36.446 --> 33:39.073
You'll have to trust
me on this one.

33:44.996 --> 33:49.576
- Alright... deal.
- Deal.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.591
You sure you're OK with Billy
and Mr Bender taking you home?

33:57.592 --> 34:01.010
Totally. Your dad kind of
creeps me out. No of fence.

34:01.011 --> 34:02.887
None taken.

34:02.888 --> 34:05.014
Are you gonna be OK, though?

34:05.015 --> 34:09.101
I don't know what I would do
if I found my dad in a motel

34:09.103 --> 34:11.187
with our neighbour and
an underage hooker.

34:11.188 --> 34:15.150
Yeah, it's not the
first time. I'm just...

34:15.150 --> 34:17.318
I'm sorry we missed the concert.

34:17.319 --> 34:20.822
It's OK. Actually, I had fun.

34:20.822 --> 34:23.616
You did?

34:23.617 --> 34:27.286
- Oddly enough, yeah.
- Really?

34:29.248 --> 34:35.000
Well, I guess we'll have
to do it again sometime.

34:38.047 --> 34:40.420
I'd like that.

34:42.051 --> 34:44.003
Me too.

34:57.192 --> 35:02.404
I know where you, Billy, Mr Bender,

35:02.405 --> 35:04.823
and your son of a bitch
father were last night.

35:04.824 --> 35:07.159
- Don't even try to deny it.
- Well...

35:07.160 --> 35:09.453
I had a detective
follow your father.

35:09.454 --> 35:12.206
Not only were he and
Keith Bender at a motel

35:12.207 --> 35:14.291
with some crack whore,

35:14.292 --> 35:17.252
you and Billy were there
with some slut of your own.

35:17.253 --> 35:19.630
What is it with the
men in this family?

35:19.631 --> 35:21.672
You're such miserable
fucks, you gotta bring in

35:21.673 --> 35:23.716
the neighbours to
pinch-hit for you?

35:23.717 --> 35:25.551
Where is your father anyway?

35:25.552 --> 35:27.637
I called to scream at
him, he wasn't there.

35:27.638 --> 35:31.390
He is on a business
trip. Lithuania.

35:31.391 --> 35:35.312
Figures he wouldn't be
here to face the music.

35:37.523 --> 35:43.569
When I get back, I'm
gonna hire a lawyer.

35:43.570 --> 35:46.193
Just you wait and see.

35:47.574 --> 35:49.116
Where are you going?

35:49.117 --> 35:50.827
What do you mean, where am I going?

35:50.828 --> 35:52.787
- It's April.
- Rehab never works for you.

35:52.788 --> 35:54.914
I think you've
developed an immunity.

35:54.915 --> 35:58.000
It always works for me, until
I come home to my family.

35:58.001 --> 36:00.961
Mom, really? Come on.

36:00.962 --> 36:03.713
- What?
- Vodka? Nice.

36:03.714 --> 36:05.841
Arriving at rehab sober
is like showing up

36:05.842 --> 36:07.968
to a tennis lesson
without a racquet.

36:07.969 --> 36:10.672
There's my cab.

36:11.889 --> 36:14.091
Don't sell the house this time.

36:16.352 --> 36:20.230
- Ricky! Yoo-hoo!
- Oh, shit!

36:20.231 --> 36:22.607
Can I speak with you for a moment?

36:22.608 --> 36:25.026
Yeah, you.

36:25.027 --> 36:28.029
- Richard.
- Father Krumins.

36:28.030 --> 36:31.241
Well, thanks again, Mrs Bender,

36:31.242 --> 36:33.827
for opening your lovely home
to this week's bingo game.

36:33.828 --> 36:35.829
Oh, not at all, Father.

36:35.830 --> 36:38.540
Hopefully, next time Lois Enlow
won't get her prosthetic arm

36:38.541 --> 36:40.459
stuck in the garbage disposal.

36:42.252 --> 36:45.880
Took Keith four hours
to get that thing out.

36:45.881 --> 36:49.300
- God bless you.
- Thanks. OK, yeah.

36:49.301 --> 36:51.051
I spoke with your
mother this morning.

36:51.052 --> 36:53.012
What were you doing with
that little slut yesterday?

36:53.013 --> 36:54.889
- Which slut?
- How many sluts were you with?

36:54.890 --> 36:56.932
One. None.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.851
Nina's not a slut, she's
a friend from school.

36:58.852 --> 37:00.895
I feel like you don't
really care about me.

37:00.896 --> 37:03.856
- Sorry?
- Can I ask you a question?

37:03.857 --> 37:07.109
- OK.
- Do you want to fuck me?

37:07.110 --> 37:09.153
Uh, Mrs Bender, I have school.

37:09.154 --> 37:12.528
Skip homeroom. Come on,
I'll write you a note. Let's go!

37:16.286 --> 37:18.037
- Argh!
- Hello.

37:18.038 --> 37:20.080
Hey, Karlis, what's up?

37:20.081 --> 37:22.624
Less than a week before Arbor
Day. How's that going?

37:22.625 --> 37:24.459
Good. I probably won't
even need that long.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.419
Hey, how do you like your pinkies?

37:26.420 --> 37:28.004
How do I like my pinkies?

37:28.005 --> 37:29.547
I mean the way they currently are.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.466
Yeah, I like my... pinkies.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.214
You better be right.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.600
A reminder, students,

37:40.601 --> 37:42.685
this year's prom has
been cancelled.

37:42.686 --> 37:45.438
Hey, you missed homeroom.
Where were you?

37:45.439 --> 37:47.315
I was fucking your
mother up the ass.

37:47.316 --> 37:51.020
- What?
- Kidding. I overslept.

37:52.947 --> 37:55.782
Hey, Billy. Hi, Rick.

37:55.783 --> 37:57.701
Hi.

38:03.623 --> 38:07.376
Everyone, this is Sister Marie
Therese Francine Dubois.

38:07.377 --> 38:10.003
She will be filling in
for the late Mr Apgar,

38:10.004 --> 38:13.549
and the late Mr Marquart, who
died so tragically on I-40.

38:14.592 --> 38:18.261
Sister is a Carmelite nun.
She's taken a vow of silence.

38:18.262 --> 38:20.472
However, given our urgent
need, Father Krumins

38:20.473 --> 38:23.350
has gracefully granted the
sister special dispensation

38:23.351 --> 38:26.144
for her to speak during class,
so she won't go to hell.

38:26.145 --> 38:28.143
Sister.

38:44.955 --> 38:48.499
I am very happy to be teaching you.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.793
My name is Sister Marie
Therese Francine Dubois.

38:50.794 --> 38:52.962
Since there isn't time to
get through what I want,

38:52.963 --> 38:55.165
I will not have time
to take any quest...

38:57.759 --> 39:00.469
- Hm.
- She died.

39:00.470 --> 39:04.515
No, she's... just sleeping.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.851
Bet you five bucks she wakes
in less than a minute

39:06.852 --> 39:08.978
without anyone saying anything.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.938
OK, you're on.

39:16.820 --> 39:21.070
Come on. Come on.

39:22.908 --> 39:24.781
30 seconds.

39:28.873 --> 39:31.041
45 seconds.

39:35.588 --> 39:37.665
55 seconds.

39:39.008 --> 39:40.675
- Yes!
- Conquest of Gaul.

39:40.676 --> 39:45.131
The forces of civilisation over
the barbarians in ipso facto...

39:47.683 --> 39:51.311
Oh! Alright, double or nothing.

39:51.312 --> 39:53.104
Count me out.

40:02.947 --> 40:05.657
What? What do you want?

40:05.658 --> 40:07.785
Are we gonna get the
rest of the day off

40:07.786 --> 40:09.661
like we did for Mr Apgar?

40:09.662 --> 40:11.955
I for one clearly feel
traumatised again.

40:11.956 --> 40:13.999
Yeah, and besides,
we got totally gypped

40:14.000 --> 40:16.210
when his replacement
bit it on the I-40.

40:16.211 --> 40:18.420
Mr Marquart never
even taught a class!

40:18.421 --> 40:20.506
Fine! You know, it's
your education.

40:20.507 --> 40:22.466
I don't give a shit,
but after today,

40:22.467 --> 40:24.718
I am going to draw up an
official school policy

40:24.719 --> 40:26.762
on faculty fatalities.

40:26.763 --> 40:29.515
Mr Stevens and Mr Bender, I'd
like to see you in my office.

40:29.516 --> 40:33.644
- 'Bye.
- I don't feel so good, Rick.

40:33.645 --> 40:35.521
Kevin Carpenter brought
to my attention

40:35.522 --> 40:37.898
that you bet on whether
or not the nun was dead.

40:37.899 --> 40:39.441
Kevin Carpenter is a dick.

40:39.442 --> 40:41.485
- We bet on when she would wake.
- Billy!

40:41.486 --> 40:44.112
You admit to gambling
on school grounds.

40:44.113 --> 40:46.906
Well, this should be good for
a nice, long suspension.

40:46.907 --> 40:49.283
I've been waiting to take
you two clowns down.

40:50.994 --> 40:53.037
There's a parent
here to speak to you

40:53.038 --> 40:54.914
about that thing that happened,

40:54.915 --> 40:57.542
that one time over by that place.

40:57.543 --> 40:59.370
Right now?

41:00.462 --> 41:03.711
I'll be right back.

41:09.638 --> 41:12.932
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Swallow it, Billy.

41:12.933 --> 41:14.600
- What are you doing?
- Check this out.

41:14.601 --> 41:16.803
Poole took this from me last year.

41:19.565 --> 41:21.483
What's this?

41:25.194 --> 41:27.320
Holy shit.

41:27.321 --> 41:29.447
These are pictures from
the girls' locker room.

41:29.448 --> 41:32.071
This is one of Nina.

41:33.995 --> 41:36.997
What are you doing, Mr Stevens?

41:36.998 --> 41:40.750
I'm just, uh, getting
out of suspension.

41:40.751 --> 41:44.462
- What is that?
- 10 to 20 would be my guess.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.590
I've never seen those
pictures before in my life.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.717
Who said anything about pictures?

41:48.718 --> 41:52.053
Well, I didn't take them.

41:52.054 --> 41:53.889
And, I mean, who's to say

41:53.890 --> 41:55.515
how long they've
actually been in there?

41:55.516 --> 41:57.475
Could have been years.

41:57.476 --> 42:00.395
This one looks an awful
lot like Emily Tolls,

42:00.396 --> 42:02.688
and she's currently a junior.

42:02.689 --> 42:07.526
Hey, how about I forget

42:07.527 --> 42:10.654
all about today's little
gambling indiscretion?

42:10.655 --> 42:12.781
How about you forget
that we even exist

42:12.782 --> 42:14.700
until the end of the school year.

42:14.701 --> 42:17.328
Rick and Billy who?

42:17.329 --> 42:21.207
Stevens and Bender. Ow.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.250
I'm gonna kill Carpenter.

42:23.251 --> 42:25.836
If you don't stop chasing after
Nina, he's gonna kill you.

42:25.837 --> 42:28.339
Yeah, but if I do stop, then
Malinauskas is gonna kill me,

42:28.340 --> 42:30.424
because I can't pay
him 1,000 bucks.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.801
Well, at least you got that
smoking hot picture of Nina.

42:32.802 --> 42:35.804
I haven't even seen it yet,
and I already popped a chub.

42:35.805 --> 42:37.723
I'm gonna burn it when I get home.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.308
Burn it? Why?

42:39.309 --> 42:41.227
It doesn't feel right
being able to see her

42:41.228 --> 42:42.769
when she doesn't even know it.

42:42.770 --> 42:44.479
What?

42:44.480 --> 42:46.439
Besides, I'll be getting the
real thing soon enough.

42:46.440 --> 42:49.317
Hey! What did Principal Poole
want to talk to you about?

42:49.318 --> 42:53.112
Uh, he wanted our help

42:53.113 --> 42:56.324
in drawing up the new school
policy on faculty fatalities.

42:56.325 --> 42:59.869
Wait! What are you two
cornholers still doing here?

42:59.870 --> 43:02.080
And because I figured he
could do better than that...

43:02.081 --> 43:04.415
What are you fucktards
still doing here?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.542
What are you fudge packers
still doing here?

43:06.543 --> 43:09.379
Ah, who am I kidding?
He's borderline Cro-Magnon.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.547
I thought Poole
suspended your asses.

43:11.548 --> 43:14.175
For your information, they were
helping amend school policy.

43:14.176 --> 43:17.471
And they were getting
ready to walk me home.

43:19.723 --> 43:22.183
I'm coming for you.

43:22.184 --> 43:25.060
- Oh!
- Butt sniffer.

43:25.061 --> 43:26.979
Dick.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.481
That poor nun.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.566
I'll have to get better
at the whole tears thing

43:31.567 --> 43:33.565
if I wanna be a priest.

43:36.072 --> 43:39.658
So this, uh, this priest thing,

43:39.659 --> 43:41.953
is it just for the
get-into-heaven-free card?

43:42.912 --> 43:45.831
No, silly. I like helping people.

43:45.832 --> 43:48.750
That's why I'm a candy-striper
at County General too.

43:48.751 --> 43:51.920
I dunno, everybody could use
a little help from time to time.

43:51.921 --> 43:56.174
You're hot. You don't
have to help people.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.427
Well, somebody has to.

43:58.428 --> 44:01.388
We all don't have our
own personal saints.

44:01.389 --> 44:04.515
Besides, I want to be the first.

44:04.516 --> 44:08.686
Like Hillary Clinton,
or Amelia Earhart.

44:08.687 --> 44:10.646
Sally Ride.

44:10.647 --> 44:12.898
I don't know, I want to be special.

44:12.899 --> 44:16.069
I think you already are special.

44:18.655 --> 44:20.781
Well, thanks for walking me home.

44:20.782 --> 44:23.485
Anytime. I, uh...

44:26.496 --> 44:29.825
I really like...
spending time with you.

44:33.795 --> 44:36.214
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

44:38.091 --> 44:40.089
There's hope for me yet.

44:45.598 --> 44:47.974
- Hey, Steven.
- Playing hooky, pussies?

44:47.975 --> 44:50.060
Steven, you don't happen to know

44:50.061 --> 44:52.020
how to say anything
in Latin, do you?

44:52.021 --> 44:55.774
- Huh?
- Saved by his own stupidity.

44:55.775 --> 44:58.485
Some dude called for you.
Something about a car.

44:58.486 --> 45:02.532
Funny way to spell 'auto'.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.244
- Yes?
- Mantas Bartuska?

45:08.245 --> 45:10.121
It's Rick Stevens.

45:10.122 --> 45:12.207
Oh, it's gonna take another week

45:12.208 --> 45:14.084
before I fix your mother's car.

45:14.085 --> 45:16.586
I want to know what wheels
would you like for a loan?

45:16.587 --> 45:18.046
Loaner?

45:18.047 --> 45:20.507
Father Krumins told me to get
you whatever car you want.

45:20.508 --> 45:22.961
- Father Krumins? Anything?
- Anything.

45:26.805 --> 45:30.057
Uh, well, my favourite
is an Aston Martin.

45:30.058 --> 45:32.477
It will be there within the hour.

45:33.812 --> 45:35.979
They're loaning me an Aston Martin.

45:35.980 --> 45:39.900
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
I got accepted to Stanford!

45:39.901 --> 45:41.527
That's amazing. You're
gonna move out.

45:41.528 --> 45:43.028
Yeah!

45:43.029 --> 45:45.402
What?

45:46.574 --> 45:51.203
Get a hard-on, break your dick
in half and fuck yourself.

45:51.204 --> 45:55.958
- Two great things in a row.
- Wait, who's Aston Martin?

46:01.589 --> 46:03.665
Knock yourself out.

46:09.471 --> 46:11.264
Whoa!

46:12.975 --> 46:17.521
<i>♪ I found my beat
It's in your sound... ♪</i>

46:18.564 --> 46:22.859
When Nina sees you in this car,
she's gonna be all over you.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.111
<i>♪ I'll curse the crowd... ♪</i>

46:25.112 --> 46:27.822
Hey, can we get Slurpees?

46:27.823 --> 46:29.365
Yeah.

46:29.366 --> 46:30.908
- Really?
- No.

46:30.909 --> 46:33.870
<i>♪ We've been living
with the lights out</i>

46:33.871 --> 46:35.955
<i>♪ Been moving in the night... ♪</i>

46:35.956 --> 46:39.375
So, uh, do you have
any plans tonight?

46:39.376 --> 46:42.462
Um, yeah, after Meals on Wheels,

46:42.463 --> 46:44.379
I'm gonna go down to the shelter

46:44.380 --> 46:46.753
and play with some
stray animals... why?

46:47.925 --> 46:50.799
Oh, uh... no reason.

46:52.013 --> 46:54.055
Do you have enough room back there?

46:54.056 --> 46:56.391
- Well, I... Not really.
- Yeah, he's fine.

46:56.392 --> 46:58.477
Don't worry about him.

46:58.478 --> 47:00.270
What the...?

47:00.271 --> 47:02.355
Pull over to the right
side of the road.

47:02.356 --> 47:04.608
- Why are they pulling us over?
- I don't know.

47:04.609 --> 47:07.562
But I bet it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

47:09.238 --> 47:12.115
Are you aware this car is
registered to Mantas Bartuska?

47:12.116 --> 47:14.201
Who?

47:14.202 --> 47:16.495
He's only one of the most
notorious Lithuanian mafiosos

47:16.496 --> 47:18.580
in the entire three-county region.

47:18.581 --> 47:21.708
- This is a mobster's car?
- No, it was a loaner.

47:21.709 --> 47:23.752
He's having my mom's car fixed.

47:23.753 --> 47:25.544
Having the mafia fix
your mother's car?

47:25.545 --> 47:27.421
- You are?
- No, no.

47:27.422 --> 47:29.548
You remember, Father Krumins
hit me, you were there.

47:29.549 --> 47:33.344
He sent me to Mr Bartuska
to have my car fixed, so...

47:33.345 --> 47:35.429
Wait, wait, wait,
the Catholic Church

47:35.430 --> 47:37.306
sent you to the Malinauskas
family's chop shop

47:37.307 --> 47:39.259
to get your car fixed?

47:40.435 --> 47:43.187
Oh, my god.

47:43.188 --> 47:47.191
Mr Stevens, I have a question
I need you to answer.

47:47.192 --> 47:49.276
OK.

47:49.277 --> 47:51.695
How did Mantas Bartuska's body

47:51.696 --> 47:53.822
end up in the trunk
of your mother's car?

47:53.823 --> 47:56.158
What? I... I didn't even know
that Mantas Bartuska was dead.

47:56.159 --> 47:57.868
I know nothing about this.

47:57.869 --> 48:00.412
We nabbed you driving
his Aston Martin.

48:00.413 --> 48:02.832
Explain that to me, please.

48:03.875 --> 48:06.459
- Am I a suspect?
- Big time.

48:06.460 --> 48:09.379
Normally, I wouldn't care about
the lowlife that got shot,

48:09.380 --> 48:14.008
but Mr Bartuska was ready
to strike a plea deal

48:14.009 --> 48:18.680
to give us the name of the
head of the Lithuanian mafia.

48:18.681 --> 48:22.016
This guy, he's so elusive
and so secretive,

48:22.017 --> 48:24.477
we don't even know his name.

48:24.478 --> 48:27.897
But Bartuska had his name,

48:27.898 --> 48:30.858
and was gonna give it to
me until this happened.

48:30.859 --> 48:32.986
I don't know what your
real involvement here is,

48:32.987 --> 48:34.862
but I know you're
guilty of something.

48:34.863 --> 48:36.573
I don't... I don't know anything.

48:36.574 --> 48:38.449
- Don't interrupt me!
- I...

48:38.450 --> 48:40.577
Yeah.

48:40.578 --> 48:42.787
Miss Stratton-Osbourne
is here for Rick.

48:42.788 --> 48:45.490
- Dadgummit! Show her in!
- Who?

48:47.625 --> 48:50.002
I've been retained to
represent Mr Stevens.

48:50.003 --> 48:52.921
If you don't mind, I'd like a
moment alone with my client.

48:52.922 --> 48:54.798
Cigarette?

48:54.799 --> 48:57.001
I'm 17.

48:58.386 --> 49:00.512
I guess you're wondering
why I'm here.

49:00.513 --> 49:02.472
Father Krumins has a
favour to ask you.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.308
Father Krumins has a
favour to ask me?

49:04.309 --> 49:06.226
He requests that you
refrain from mentioning

49:06.227 --> 49:08.812
that the church is the one that
referred you to Mr Bartuska.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.981
- But I already did.
- Oh.

49:10.982 --> 49:13.692
Well, tell them you were kidding.

49:13.693 --> 49:15.902
- The church wants me to lie?
- Yes.

49:15.903 --> 49:17.738
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yes.

49:17.739 --> 49:19.615
I've been doing some research.

49:19.616 --> 49:21.700
Is it true your dad is
on business in Vilnius?

49:21.701 --> 49:23.243
Uh, I think so.

49:23.244 --> 49:25.995
Do what I say, I'll have you
out of here within the hour.

49:25.996 --> 49:27.955
Are you sure you can get me off?

49:27.956 --> 49:30.875
Kid, I've gotten off more
guys than I care to remember.

49:30.876 --> 49:32.710
How did you get the Aston Martin?

49:32.711 --> 49:34.587
What Aston Martin?

49:34.588 --> 49:36.714
If you don't tell me
how you got the car,

49:36.715 --> 49:38.799
I'm gonna put you in
prison with an inmate

49:38.800 --> 49:41.135
who will eat your genitals
off while you're sleeping.

49:41.136 --> 49:44.680
Tell him the truth,
just like we practised.

49:44.681 --> 49:46.766
Mr Bartuska gave it to me.

49:46.767 --> 49:49.435
Why would Big Barty give you
a brand-new Aston Martin?

49:49.436 --> 49:53.648
He said that it was a gift
in honour of my father.

49:53.649 --> 49:56.859
What did your father do to earn
such a gift from a mobster?

49:56.860 --> 49:59.111
Well, it's definitely not because

49:59.112 --> 50:01.572
he's a kingpin in the
Lithuanian mafia.

50:01.573 --> 50:04.699
Expect me to believe that this
loser's father is in the mob?

50:04.700 --> 50:06.242
Draw your own conclusions,

50:06.243 --> 50:08.536
but given the alternative is
that the mob hired this kid...

50:08.537 --> 50:11.081
I mean, look at him...
I think you'll see

50:11.082 --> 50:13.291
it makes sense to
look into the father.

50:13.292 --> 50:15.543
Do you have any evidence
to back this up?

50:15.544 --> 50:19.255
Well, my father is currently
on business... in Lithuania.

50:19.256 --> 50:20.799
Check his credit card records.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.547
You'll see he's telling the truth.

50:23.511 --> 50:25.512
Ho! Hah!

50:25.513 --> 50:27.639
Well, you and your
client can leave now,

50:27.640 --> 50:31.267
and I'm gonna make some
phone calls... right here.

50:31.268 --> 50:33.937
And if I don't like the
answers I'm getting,

50:33.938 --> 50:37.065
I'm gonna come see you...
I know where you live.

50:37.066 --> 50:39.526
Nice work... by the
time those yokels

50:39.527 --> 50:41.945
get through chasing that line
of bullshit about your father,

50:41.946 --> 50:44.406
this whole incident
will be long forgotten.

50:44.407 --> 50:46.907
Oh, and by the way, I got
your car out of impound.

50:46.908 --> 50:49.076
You can keep it until your
mom's car gets fixed.

50:49.077 --> 50:51.871
You want to give me a ride
home in your new wheels?

50:56.793 --> 50:58.877
Why does it smell
like puke in here?

50:58.878 --> 51:02.381
If I get a speeding ticket, you
can get me out of it, right?

51:02.382 --> 51:04.258
It's a piece of cake.

51:04.259 --> 51:07.052
Oh, can I take a few of these?
I get these tension headaches.

51:07.053 --> 51:10.013
Wait, no, those are ecs...

51:10.014 --> 51:11.887
Those are expired.

51:20.316 --> 51:21.984
Ohhh! Oooh!

51:23.445 --> 51:25.445
Oh, turn here.

51:27.573 --> 51:29.615
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

51:29.616 --> 51:32.034
Ohh! I love it!

51:32.035 --> 51:34.579
Just touch my hand. Oh, my
God, that feels so good.

51:34.580 --> 51:37.374
Oh, my God.

51:39.668 --> 51:44.214
- Oh, my God!
- Ah.

51:49.344 --> 51:52.513
You're just the nicest
guy I've ever met.

51:52.514 --> 51:56.184
Do you know you're pure,
like a baby, innocent puppy.

51:56.185 --> 51:59.520
Like an angel dog, like a
little sweet puppy angel

51:59.521 --> 52:01.773
coming from the heavens
to save the world.

52:01.774 --> 52:04.317
Do you want to come in and
listen to some trance music?

52:04.318 --> 52:06.318
Don't do it, Rick.

52:06.319 --> 52:09.898
You're this close to
my promised land.

52:11.574 --> 52:13.116
No, we're here, get out.

52:13.117 --> 52:15.202
When I was a kid,
I wished for big boobs.

52:15.203 --> 52:17.370
- And then I got them.
- Oh, that's great.

52:17.371 --> 52:19.080
- Isn't that cool?
- That's great, thank you.

52:19.081 --> 52:21.208
You want to come in
for some tequila?

52:21.209 --> 52:24.169
'Bye! No! Nope. Thank
you, though. 'Bye!

52:24.170 --> 52:25.917
Huh!

52:44.899 --> 52:46.982
Where the hell have you been?

52:46.983 --> 52:49.735
Just undergoing interrogation
downtown about my mob ties.

52:49.736 --> 52:51.612
Hilarious.

52:51.613 --> 52:53.155
Hi, Cherysh.

52:53.156 --> 52:54.949
Hello.

52:55.784 --> 52:57.493
So you've opened a brothel.

52:57.494 --> 52:59.578
Remember the rules...
they can touch you,

52:59.579 --> 53:01.747
but you can't touch them.

53:04.417 --> 53:06.669
It's perfect. See, they
do it every night anyway.

53:06.670 --> 53:08.587
And this way we make money,

53:08.588 --> 53:10.756
which will be more than
enough to pay Karlis.

53:10.757 --> 53:13.592
So you're already giving up?

53:13.593 --> 53:17.429
No, I just... I want
to cover all my bases,

53:17.430 --> 53:20.975
just in case Nina and I
decide to take it slow.

53:20.976 --> 53:23.769
Oh. OK.

53:26.605 --> 53:28.356
Have they had their shots?

53:28.357 --> 53:31.276
Who cares? We're opening a
strip club, not a vet's office.

53:31.277 --> 53:33.194
They're on the pillows, Rick.

53:35.114 --> 53:38.408
<i>♪ Money don't get
everything, it's true</i>

53:38.409 --> 53:40.118
<i>♪ What it don't get I can't use</i>

53:40.119 --> 53:41.866
<i>♪ I want money... ♪</i>

53:43.080 --> 53:45.665
Hey, Kristen, we should throw a
party to celebrate you leaving.

53:45.666 --> 53:47.542
I mean, you getting into Stanford.

53:47.543 --> 53:50.795
- Yay! Party!
- Exactly.

53:50.796 --> 53:52.881
I can smell her cooter from here.

53:52.882 --> 53:55.174
What the hell are you up to?

53:55.175 --> 53:58.386
Nothing. Steven can invite all
his muscle freaks from the gym.

53:58.387 --> 54:01.514
I guess we could raid Mom's
secret alcohol stash.

54:01.515 --> 54:03.391
Oh, her brain would explode.

54:03.392 --> 54:05.393
We'd be helping with
her road to recovery.

54:05.394 --> 54:07.846
I'm only thinking of her.
Pfft! Steven!

54:10.940 --> 54:12.858
Is this gonna work?

54:12.859 --> 54:15.110
You don't think your
sister is gonna be pissed

54:15.111 --> 54:17.654
that you gave her children's
chewables instead of ecstasy?

54:17.655 --> 54:19.698
She'll be way too wasted to notice.

54:19.699 --> 54:22.451
Besides, she said she'd only
do it if we gave her 10 pills

54:22.452 --> 54:25.037
and I only have two left.

54:26.164 --> 54:30.460
They even fucked with her land.
She's gonna go fucking crazy.

54:31.461 --> 54:34.004
We need to get them
to start mingling

54:34.005 --> 54:36.048
or I'm never gonna
make 1,000 bucks.

54:36.049 --> 54:38.425
Hi, everyone.

54:38.426 --> 54:42.347
Billy tells me you guys
are having a party.

54:43.765 --> 54:46.217
That sounds like a lot of fun.

54:49.227 --> 54:50.770
Am I invited?

54:50.771 --> 54:53.940
As long as you don't tell Mom.

54:53.941 --> 54:57.020
Tell her what?

54:58.236 --> 55:03.199
And, uh, honey? I owe you
a bottle of Tylenol.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.947
I took the last two.

55:08.288 --> 55:10.206
- Drinks?
- Oh, yeah.

55:10.207 --> 55:12.875
It's a strip club, Billy.
You don't invite your mother.

55:12.876 --> 55:14.543
Mrs Bender?

55:14.544 --> 55:16.671
Mrs Bender.

55:16.672 --> 55:17.713
Huh!

55:17.714 --> 55:19.840
- I'm not wearing any panties.
- Uhhh.

55:19.841 --> 55:21.968
Mrs Bender, Billy and everyone
are in the other room.

55:21.969 --> 55:26.137
- Oh! I like you so much! Whoo!
- Mrs Bender, Mrs Bender.

55:26.138 --> 55:29.091
- Oh, you're so sexy.
- No, no, no.

55:31.852 --> 55:33.770
Whoo!

55:33.771 --> 55:37.899
Shh! Be quiet. Everybody's
in the other room. OK? Billy...

55:37.900 --> 55:39.526
Shhh!

55:39.527 --> 55:41.194
Whoo, yeah!

55:41.195 --> 55:44.572
Oh, this feels kind of good.
Oh, it feels really good.

55:44.573 --> 55:46.616
Oh! Ohhh!

55:46.617 --> 55:50.453
Oh, I love this dishwasher. Yeah!

55:50.454 --> 55:52.122
Oh! Mr Bender is pulling up.

55:52.123 --> 55:54.290
- Fuck him.
- Great idea. Why don't you?

55:54.291 --> 55:56.042
- I want you.
- Oh, no. No.

55:56.043 --> 55:59.879
I want you so bad. I do, I do.

55:59.880 --> 56:03.425
Ah! This is what I'm talking about.

56:03.426 --> 56:04.843
No, no, no.

56:04.844 --> 56:07.469
This could be good.
It's gonna be good.

56:07.470 --> 56:10.472
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

56:10.473 --> 56:13.559
This is so disturbing.

56:13.560 --> 56:16.437
Oh, Ricky! Oh! Ricky!

56:16.438 --> 56:19.064
What the...?

56:19.065 --> 56:20.983
From the look on Billy's face,

56:20.984 --> 56:24.528
he had apparently never seen his mother
masturbating on the kitchen floor before.

56:24.529 --> 56:26.321
What are you doing to my mom?

56:26.322 --> 56:27.906
- Ricky!
- Nothing!

56:27.907 --> 56:29.992
I wasn't doing it. She
was doing it by herself.

56:29.993 --> 56:31.535
She was just... she was just...

56:31.536 --> 56:33.120
I feel so good!

56:33.121 --> 56:35.080
OK. OK.

56:35.081 --> 56:37.079
- Momma?
- So happy to see you.

56:38.543 --> 56:41.003
She's acting kind of weird, Rick.

56:41.004 --> 56:44.214
Hell, no, that's a mean thing
to say about your mom.

56:44.215 --> 56:46.008
Can you put her in Lucy's room?

56:46.009 --> 56:48.468
And let her lie down.
She's just, you know...

56:48.469 --> 56:50.678
Will you come? Please?

56:50.679 --> 56:53.181
She hasn't bitten me since I
was 10. That's kind of weird.

56:53.182 --> 56:55.600
I love you. I love you so much.

56:55.601 --> 56:57.727
I love you too, Momma.
Here, here...

56:57.728 --> 56:59.851
- I love Tylenol.
- No, no, no.

57:03.192 --> 57:05.651
- I'm fucking busy here!
- Jimmy, it's Rick.

57:05.652 --> 57:07.653
I need your advice on
something drug-related.

57:07.654 --> 57:10.323
- Shoot.
- This chick downed two E tabs.

57:10.324 --> 57:12.868
Now she doesn't look so good.
Is she gonna be OK?

57:13.869 --> 57:15.828
- Is she hot?
- Uh, yeah.

57:15.829 --> 57:17.497
What does that have
to do with anything?

57:17.498 --> 57:19.245
Why are you asking me that?

57:20.542 --> 57:22.752
- I'll be right over.
- OK, thank God.

57:22.753 --> 57:24.796
You got any lube?

57:54.033 --> 57:58.078
Thank you. Come again.
Not on the furniture.

57:58.079 --> 58:00.205
- Where's the bitch at?
- Oh.

58:00.206 --> 58:02.165
It's Billy's mom. Are
you sure you can help?

58:02.166 --> 58:04.209
Trust me, I used to be a doctor.

58:04.210 --> 58:06.253
What the fuck is going on in here?

58:06.254 --> 58:08.376
Oh...

58:09.297 --> 58:13.001
- You know Kristen?
- I will totally not gag.

58:25.272 --> 58:26.519
Rick?

58:28.733 --> 58:30.943
Hey, Nina, what brings you by?

58:30.944 --> 58:32.611
Hey, I was just wondering

58:32.612 --> 58:34.155
if everything worked
out with the car.

58:34.156 --> 58:36.240
Yeah, it was all
just a crazy mix-up.

58:36.241 --> 58:39.451
Well, good. I, um...
I was worried about you.

58:39.452 --> 58:41.162
You were worried about me?

58:41.163 --> 58:43.581
Why are all these girls naked?

58:43.582 --> 58:46.667
Yeah, it's weird,
right? I don't know.

58:46.668 --> 58:48.835
Put that in my ass!

58:48.836 --> 58:51.630
Maybe we should go somewhere
more quiet to talk, please?

58:53.716 --> 58:57.177
When I pee... it burns.

59:05.102 --> 59:09.480
- Where's Nina, dick breath?
- Uh, this is a private club.

59:09.481 --> 59:11.566
Tell me where Nina is or
I'm calling the cops,

59:11.567 --> 59:13.109
'cause I doubt that
this neighbourhood

59:13.110 --> 59:15.195
is zoned for a strip club.

59:15.196 --> 59:18.448
How about I give you
50% off a lap dance?

59:18.449 --> 59:20.825
How about I shove another
broomstick up your ass?

59:20.826 --> 59:22.869
How about I give you
a free lap dance?

59:26.956 --> 59:28.957
I'll take that blonde over there.

59:28.958 --> 59:31.335
She looks like a dick wrecker.

59:31.336 --> 59:33.587
But after I come,
I'm coming for you,

59:33.588 --> 59:35.589
and you better tell
me where Nina is.

59:35.590 --> 59:38.383
- Freak!
- Oh! Dick.

59:38.384 --> 59:41.303
I've never been to a
party like this before.

59:41.304 --> 59:44.306
Yeah, me, neither. They're
Kristen's friends, really.

59:44.307 --> 59:47.768
- It's kind of fun.
- Yeah?

59:47.769 --> 59:53.442
Well, I guess, uh, life in my
family is just nonstop fun.

59:55.401 --> 59:57.736
So are your parents ever around?

59:57.737 --> 01:00:00.322
Rehab always evicts my mom
when her insurance runs out,

01:00:00.323 --> 01:00:02.407
and my dad eventually
wants something,

01:00:02.408 --> 01:00:05.157
so... he comes around.

01:00:05.995 --> 01:00:08.287
My parents are always away too.

01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:13.292
Chasing the latest shrine
or Virgin spotting.

01:00:13.293 --> 01:00:17.922
They've been at it ever since
my little sister died.

01:00:17.923 --> 01:00:20.466
Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:23.637
Oh, no, it's... My parents
like to keep it quiet.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.264
I go along with it

01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:29.058
because I know at
the end of the day,

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:33.229
our parents are just as
scared and confused as we are

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.524
about everything.

01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:45.069
Yeah, I never really thought
about mine like that.

01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:49.077
Maybe you should.

01:00:50.204 --> 01:00:51.788
Here, give me your hand.

01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:54.083
- What?
- Hmm.

01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:56.835
Hold still.

01:00:56.836 --> 01:00:59.254
What are you drawing?

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:02.048
You'll see.

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:04.217
That's the Tau Cross.

01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:07.304
It's the symbol of Saint
Francis of Assisi,

01:01:07.305 --> 01:01:09.514
the patron of families.

01:01:09.515 --> 01:01:12.389
Maybe it'll give you
better luck with yours.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.514
You're really amazing,
you know that?

01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:27.406
Here's a rock.

01:01:27.407 --> 01:01:29.154
Oh.

01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:32.408
Thank you.

01:01:34.372 --> 01:01:35.914
It actually fell from the sky,

01:01:35.915 --> 01:01:41.420
so it's kind of like
your own personal star.

01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:43.168
And you can...

01:01:44.257 --> 01:01:47.381
you can make as many
wishes as you want.

01:01:51.431 --> 01:01:53.679
You know, you're not
so bad yourself.

01:01:56.394 --> 01:01:58.729
Thank you.

01:02:07.613 --> 01:02:09.155
Hmmm!

01:02:09.156 --> 01:02:10.698
Hi, Ricky.

01:02:10.699 --> 01:02:13.451
Hello, gorgeous.

01:02:15.537 --> 01:02:18.289
Oh, I'm so happy you
came to see me.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.166
Doctor's in the house.

01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:22.251
Oh, fun, role playing.

01:02:22.252 --> 01:02:25.171
I'm your new gynecologist.

01:02:25.172 --> 01:02:27.298
I like it. I like to role play.

01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:29.217
I'm here to check your ovaries.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.513
Oh, you're not Ricky!

01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:34.931
Just breathe.

01:02:34.932 --> 01:02:37.100
Ohhhh!

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:42.146
Yeah, you like that?

01:02:42.147 --> 01:02:44.941
Squeeze 'em! Squeeze 'em tighter.

01:02:44.942 --> 01:02:47.610
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Harder! Harder!

01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:52.197
Squeeze 'em hard. Like they're
small... Filipino children.

01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:55.534
Squeeze 'em! Yeah.

01:02:55.535 --> 01:02:57.869
Ohh!

01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.913
You pervert!

01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:07.129
Which one of you is Rick Stevens?

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.841
<i>♪ But if it wasn't for
your misfortune... ♪</i>

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:13.593
- It's like a 'T'.
- A 'T'?

01:03:13.594 --> 01:03:16.217
It happens to be my
favourite letter.

01:03:17.223 --> 01:03:19.266
That's good.

01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:24.938
What is going on in here,
you slutty, slutty little bitch?

01:03:24.939 --> 01:03:27.899
- Uh, nothing, Mrs Stevens.
- She's not my mother.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.650
She knew that.

01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:32.486
I was waiting for you.
You never came.

01:03:32.487 --> 01:03:35.406
- She's very pretty.
- She's obviously on drugs.

01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:37.234
Which one of you is Rick Stevens?

01:03:39.578 --> 01:03:42.413
What is this bullshit I've been
hearing through the grapevine

01:03:42.414 --> 01:03:45.624
about you claiming you're the
top crime family in town?

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:48.252
- You're in a crime family?
- You're in a crime family?

01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:49.795
And what do you think you're doing

01:03:49.796 --> 01:03:51.505
operating a strip joint
on our territory?

01:03:51.506 --> 01:03:54.592
- Your territory? Who are you?
- The Malinauskas family.

01:03:54.593 --> 01:03:56.135
Shit. Malinauskas.

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.803
Like any respectable organisation,

01:03:57.804 --> 01:03:59.513
we have our ears in
the police force.

01:03:59.514 --> 01:04:01.682
And they tell us there's
this Joseph Stevens

01:04:01.683 --> 01:04:03.309
trying to hedge in on our business.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:06.187
The problem is I never
even heard of him.

01:04:06.188 --> 01:04:08.185
So you know what I think?

01:04:10.649 --> 01:04:13.359
I think you're nobody at all.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.903
He's nobody.

01:04:21.744 --> 01:04:24.120
You're right. I'm a nobody.

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:29.000
And, uh, my father
is really a nobody.

01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:31.419
And Mantas Bartuska

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.631
wasn't found shot to death
in my mother's trunk.

01:04:34.632 --> 01:04:38.510
You're saying your
father made big body?

01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:40.637
I'm not saying anything.

01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:46.309
I'm not saying my father
offed 152 people in Jersey.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:48.268
And I'm definitely not saying

01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:50.729
we're in the witness
protection program.

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:54.274
So you're in a crime family and
the witness protection program?

01:04:54.275 --> 01:04:57.069
And you're having relations
with a woman this old?

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.863
Old? That is so mean.

01:04:59.864 --> 01:05:02.032
I can't believe I
almost kissed you.

01:05:02.033 --> 01:05:03.575
- Whore! Come back!
- Nina.

01:05:03.576 --> 01:05:05.202
- Please wait.
- Not so fast.

01:05:05.203 --> 01:05:07.781
I wanna have a little
conversation with your father.

01:05:08.748 --> 01:05:10.290
Later.

01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:12.876
Nina, Nina, Nina!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:12.877 --> 01:05:15.420
You are not the type of person

01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:17.506
I wish to associate
with, Rick Stevens.

01:05:17.507 --> 01:05:19.633
- Can't you just let me...
- So, you're Rick, huh?

01:05:19.634 --> 01:05:22.135
- Yes.
- Karlis has a message for you.

01:05:22.136 --> 01:05:24.304
He said tomorrow's Arbor Day,

01:05:24.305 --> 01:05:26.723
so unless you plough
that chick by midnight,

01:05:26.724 --> 01:05:29.016
you better have the
1,000 bucks you owe him

01:05:29.017 --> 01:05:31.470
or else he's gonna be
really fucking mad.

01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:36.440
You bet that you would
'plough' somebody?

01:05:36.441 --> 01:05:37.483
No...

01:05:37.484 --> 01:05:39.151
Who else were you planning
on sleeping with?

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:40.945
You!

01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:43.573
I mean, you.

01:05:43.574 --> 01:05:45.449
You... ass face!

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:48.244
- Oh!
- Jeez...

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:50.204
You OK, buddy?

01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:54.875
Ho! I was just a guest at a party.

01:05:54.876 --> 01:05:57.253
I want to talk to my lawyer.
Annette Stratton-Osborne.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:58.796
Mr Stevens! Mr Stevens!

01:05:58.797 --> 01:06:00.423
Officer, there's been a
huge misunderstanding.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:01.924
- A misunderstanding?
- Make some room here.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.218
- Right. You're coming downtown.
- Just calm down, kids.

01:06:04.219 --> 01:06:06.137
- What are you doing?
- Ma'am, keep your panties on.

01:06:06.138 --> 01:06:07.263
Nina, Nina...

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:09.764
Mr Stevens, Brian Savage,
Channel 9, 'Eyewitness News'.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:12.642
Mr Stevens, is it true
the melee here tonight

01:06:12.643 --> 01:06:15.020
is the result of crime
family rivalries?

01:06:15.021 --> 01:06:17.647
I'm Tina Johnson, investigative
reporter with Channel 5.

01:06:17.648 --> 01:06:20.609
Mr Stevens, I would love to
get an exclusive interview.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.030
I promise I will make it
extremely worth your while.

01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:28.235
Whore!

01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:33.955
- I love you! I love you!
- He's mine!

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.790
Alright, calm down!
Everybody, you have to...

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.501
OK, I know this is
bad, but... again.

01:06:38.502 --> 01:06:40.754
Again. Again.

01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:42.881
Can we get the patrol here, please?

01:06:42.882 --> 01:06:44.424
Little jackass!

01:06:44.425 --> 01:06:46.134
Hey, cunt, thanks for
stealing my story.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.469
Kristen, you're gonna get arrested.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.219
Hey, cock cop,

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.343
this is for stealing Nina.

01:06:53.224 --> 01:06:54.767
Oh, shit.

01:06:54.768 --> 01:06:56.602
You fucking Oompa-Loompa.

01:06:56.603 --> 01:06:58.520
You stole my story!

01:06:58.521 --> 01:07:00.439
Now there's going to
be a quid pro quo.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.768
- That's live.
- Everybody freeze!

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:14.913
This is pretty.

01:07:17.082 --> 01:07:19.159
We're gonna need some backup.

01:07:24.756 --> 01:07:28.801
I'm gonna trust you with this.
This is a Timex there.

01:07:28.802 --> 01:07:31.844
I'm gluten-free, so I can't...

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:38.726
I can't have any bread unless
it's, like, a rice flour.

01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:41.604
- Principal Poole?
- Rick.

01:07:41.605 --> 01:07:43.856
Officer, I got an alibi right here.

01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:48.152
Tell them I didn't know anything about
the camera in the girls locker room.

01:07:48.153 --> 01:07:51.364
I've never seen this
man before in my life.

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:53.909
We had a deal.

01:07:56.245 --> 01:07:59.914
I want to talk to my lawyer,
Annette Stratton-Osborne.

01:07:59.915 --> 01:08:02.368
Come on, Pee-wee.

01:08:04.837 --> 01:08:07.130
Hi, Jimmy.

01:08:07.131 --> 01:08:10.132
Number one, did you
know that Billy's mom

01:08:10.133 --> 01:08:11.758
shaves her beef curtains?

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:13.844
- I did know that.
- Number two.

01:08:13.845 --> 01:08:17.555
Some trash bag cop planted a
couple of grams of coke on me.

01:08:17.557 --> 01:08:19.349
You believe that shit?

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:21.268
I find that very hard to believe.

01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:23.270
I can't be in here.

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.856
My face, this bod...
You've seen my ass.

01:08:25.857 --> 01:08:29.317
Three, I need you to
contact my attorney.

01:08:29.318 --> 01:08:31.611
Beautiful tits, Annette St...

01:08:31.612 --> 01:08:33.359
Stratton-Osborne, got it.

01:08:37.118 --> 01:08:39.243
Kristen, Kristen, don't cry.

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:41.162
I used the lap-dancing
money to bail you out...

01:08:41.163 --> 01:08:42.706
you'll be free within the hour.

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:44.582
I have a criminal record.

01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:46.626
Lots of people have
criminal records.

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:49.212
Stanford is going to
rescind my acceptance.

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:51.380
That was my last shot.

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:56.045
- I'll figure something out, OK?
- Great, great.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.433
You motherfucker!

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:05.019
Get the fuck over here!
Get the fuck over here!

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.937
- I swear to God...
- It was good seeing you.

01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:09.310
- Good to see you too, fuckhead.
- Yeah, great, yeah.

01:09:10.817 --> 01:09:12.359
Fuck!

01:09:15.822 --> 01:09:20.618
- Billy, hey, Billy.
- Huh? Oh! Oh! Rick.

01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:22.578
Sorry to wake you.
This is crazy, huh?

01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:24.662
They got me on a pandering rap.

01:09:24.663 --> 01:09:27.124
I don't even know what
'pandering' means.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.959
Look, you gotta use the money
that I collected at the party

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.836
to bail me out, OK?

01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:33.712
There's none left.

01:09:33.714 --> 01:09:35.840
- What do you mean?
- There's no money left.

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:38.009
We collected a whole
shoebox full of money.

01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:40.094
- I had to bail my sister out.
- What about me?

01:09:40.095 --> 01:09:42.095
I figured your mom
could bail you out.

01:09:42.096 --> 01:09:44.849
- My mom's in jail, Rick.
- Didn't even think about that.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.725
Well, at least this nice man

01:09:46.727 --> 01:09:49.020
offered to give me a cavity search,

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:50.939
which would save me a
trip to the dentist.

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:52.607
You know how much I
hate the dentist.

01:09:52.608 --> 01:09:55.186
Oh, God, Billy, stay strong.

01:10:03.202 --> 01:10:05.154
Hi.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.248
Have you got in touch
with your parents yet?

01:10:08.249 --> 01:10:12.251
They're in Dallas for
the Pro-life Gun Expo.

01:10:12.252 --> 01:10:14.294
Is there anything I can do?

01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:16.338
Yeah, you can...

01:10:16.339 --> 01:10:18.587
go eff yourself.

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:25.722
I liked you,

01:10:25.723 --> 01:10:29.302
despite the fact that you don't
have your future planned out.

01:10:30.687 --> 01:10:34.141
Despite the fact that
your socks never match.

01:10:36.234 --> 01:10:38.402
Despite the fact that your ringtone

01:10:38.403 --> 01:10:40.362
is 'Nigga What, Nigga Who.'

01:10:40.363 --> 01:10:42.406
It's my favourite song.

01:10:42.407 --> 01:10:45.030
I liked you because I thought
that you were different.

01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:48.495
And clearly I was wrong.

01:10:48.496 --> 01:10:50.955
No, Nina, I am different. When
I'm with you, I'm different.

01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:54.750
It's just everyone around me
keeps messing me up, you know?

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.253
And I'm in this... Like the
bet, that wasn't even my idea.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:59.047
Will you grow up?

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.049
Take responsibility
for your actions

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:05.129
and accept that some things
are 100% your fault.

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:09.849
Like the fact that I never
want to see you again.

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:11.802
Nina...

01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:15.935
- Nina, I'm sorry.
- Will you go?

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.276
OK. Look, I...

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.238
Never mind.

The cops arrested Dad

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.947
because you told them that he
was a Lithuanian mob kingpin.

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:09.824
Mom's on her way back from
rehab and she is pissed.

01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:13.911
Ugh! It's my turn.

01:12:13.912 --> 01:12:15.913
This is Kristen Stevens.

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:19.041
No, I'm the Godfather's daughter.

01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:22.544
I'll sell you my exclusive story,

01:12:22.545 --> 01:12:25.714
but not for a cent under 1,500.

01:12:25.715 --> 01:12:28.884
OK, thank you.

01:12:28.885 --> 01:12:31.470
You just sold your
story for $1,500?

01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:36.308
This time. I've already sold
it for 1,000 and 1,200.

01:12:36.309 --> 01:12:38.644
- You don't even have a story.
- You don't know that.

01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:41.897
Ugh! It's my turn, twat!

01:12:41.898 --> 01:12:44.066
If it wasn't for me, Dad
wouldn't have been arrested.

01:12:44.067 --> 01:12:45.609
Stevens Crime Syndicate.

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.319
Why are you answering
the phone like that?

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.989
- Hey, Dad.
- Don't you "Hey, Dad" me.

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.906
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

01:12:51.907 --> 01:12:54.659
I lost my job. I spent the
night in a Lithuanian jail.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.744
I woke up to someone
masturbating in my face!

01:12:56.745 --> 01:12:58.413
And I have crabs!

01:12:58.414 --> 01:13:00.748
- Did you break omerta?
- Cut the crap, you shithead.

01:13:00.749 --> 01:13:03.501
I think I know where all
these mafia rumours started

01:13:03.502 --> 01:13:05.503
and you are in serious
trouble, young man.

01:13:05.504 --> 01:13:08.297
Psshhht! You're breaking up.
You're breaking up. Psshhht!

01:13:08.298 --> 01:13:11.175
- I'm at a payphone, you fuck!
- Going through a tunnel. Psht!

01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:12.923
Don't you dare...

01:13:14.304 --> 01:13:17.098
Dad says hi, by the way.

01:13:27.484 --> 01:13:29.277
What the hell...?

01:13:30.446 --> 01:13:32.318
What the hell...?!

01:13:37.535 --> 01:13:39.327
Crabs. Great.

01:13:39.328 --> 01:13:40.871
Buenos tardes.

01:13:40.872 --> 01:13:42.622
Jesus Christ!

01:13:42.623 --> 01:13:44.996
Can you use the front
door for once?

01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:50.248
You're back.

01:13:55.178 --> 01:13:56.720
I have no clue what you're saying.

01:13:56.721 --> 01:14:00.223
I have a message for you from God.

01:14:00.224 --> 01:14:02.059
Stop being such a screw-up.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.352
Oh, and don't lose faith.

01:14:04.353 --> 01:14:06.396
That's it? That's
all God has to say?

01:14:06.397 --> 01:14:08.607
What did you want, the
winning lotto numbers?

01:14:08.608 --> 01:14:12.068
It's Arbor Day.
Game's over, big boy.

01:14:12.069 --> 01:14:13.896
Time to pay your debts.

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:18.279
What am I supposed to do?
How can I set things right?

01:14:22.412 --> 01:14:24.914
Stop thinking with
your little head.

01:14:24.915 --> 01:14:26.662
You were given two.

01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:35.424
She always does that.

01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:38.177
Which brings us back
to the beginning.

01:14:38.178 --> 01:14:41.052
Not there. We already saw all that.

01:14:45.268 --> 01:14:48.145
Stop! Now that we're back
to where we started,

01:14:48.146 --> 01:14:51.975
your guess is as good as mine
as to how this fucker ends.

01:15:04.995 --> 01:15:07.205
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:15:07.206 --> 01:15:09.833
It's been, like, two months
since my last confession.

01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.918
- It's been three years, Rick.
- Really?

01:15:11.919 --> 01:15:13.461
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

01:15:13.462 --> 01:15:15.338
Tell me about you sins, child.

01:15:15.339 --> 01:15:18.007
I've lied a few times.

01:15:18.008 --> 01:15:19.843
Why did you lie?

01:15:19.844 --> 01:15:21.928
I was trying to win the
heart of Nina Pennington,

01:15:21.929 --> 01:15:23.471
but it didn't work.

01:15:23.472 --> 01:15:26.516
Well, it's not a mortal sin.
Anything else?

01:15:26.517 --> 01:15:28.434
I had sex a few times.

01:15:28.435 --> 01:15:30.562
I'm gonna need names.

01:15:30.563 --> 01:15:33.897
Well, first I almost got a blow job

01:15:33.898 --> 01:15:36.316
from a stripper down at
the club named Cherysh.

01:15:36.317 --> 01:15:38.318
That's a venial sin.

01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:40.320
Serious nonetheless,
but not mortal.

01:15:40.321 --> 01:15:42.698
And I've been having
sex kind of regularly

01:15:42.699 --> 01:15:45.152
with... Mrs Bender.

01:15:46.744 --> 01:15:48.704
- Pamela Bender?
- Yep.

01:15:48.705 --> 01:15:50.455
Keith Bender's wife?

01:15:50.456 --> 01:15:52.332
Your best friend Billy
Bender's mother?

01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:55.544
- That one.
- You son of a bitch!

01:15:55.545 --> 01:15:58.672
You're the dirty little
cocksucker that gave me crabs!

01:15:58.673 --> 01:16:02.298
You're excommunicated.
Ex-fucking-communicated!

01:16:03.219 --> 01:16:06.388
Well, that didn't go as
well as I had hoped.

01:16:06.389 --> 01:16:08.390
I didn't get the chance
to tell Father Krumins

01:16:08.391 --> 01:16:09.933
that the source of his crabs

01:16:09.934 --> 01:16:12.477
was more likely a crack
whore from the Do-Me-Inn.

01:16:24.072 --> 01:16:26.199
- Ricky.
- Mm-hm.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.826
- Did you give me crabs?
- I think you gave them to me.

01:16:28.827 --> 01:16:30.912
That is so funny.

01:16:33.207 --> 01:16:35.291
Where's your mother?

01:16:35.292 --> 01:16:38.252
Uh, well, she attempted suicide

01:16:38.253 --> 01:16:40.213
and the ambulance driver
said she's probably dead.

01:16:40.214 --> 01:16:42.548
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

01:16:42.549 --> 01:16:44.383
She didn't have a
drink in her hand.

01:16:44.384 --> 01:16:46.837
But she did leave this letter
blaming you for everything.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.722
I called her last night?

01:16:49.723 --> 01:16:52.057
I must've been much more
out of it than I thought.

01:16:52.058 --> 01:16:53.767
I feel awful that I hurt my mother

01:16:53.768 --> 01:16:55.769
by having sex with you, Mrs Bender,

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:58.146
so I promised God that I
wouldn't fuck you anymore

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:00.023
if he spares my mother's life.

01:17:00.024 --> 01:17:02.817
Sounded a bit too
melodramatic, so I add...

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:06.404
- Do you want a cocktail?
- I've gotta get to the jail.

01:17:06.405 --> 01:17:08.615
Make sure Billy hasn't
been raped or anything.

01:17:08.616 --> 01:17:10.158
You didn't get him released yet?

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:12.035
I was tired.

01:17:12.036 --> 01:17:14.788
I gotta go down to the hospital,
see if my mom's dead yet.

01:17:14.789 --> 01:17:17.666
Will you call me as soon
as you know anything?

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:20.835
Because if she lives, I'll
rent us a room at the Hyatt.

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:23.421
Mrs Bender, I made a
promise to God and I...

01:17:23.422 --> 01:17:25.382
What would you rather do,

01:17:25.383 --> 01:17:27.717
explain to God how you
were momentarily weak

01:17:27.718 --> 01:17:31.804
or explain to my husband, who
owns a store full of guns,

01:17:31.805 --> 01:17:34.224
how he caught crabs?

01:17:36.017 --> 01:17:38.185
I have to take responsibility
for my actions.

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.354
If I don't, somebody else might
try and kill themselves.

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:43.524
I had no idea that you
felt this way, Richard.

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:45.526
- Mrs Bender...
- I thought...

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.903
I thought that you
enjoyed our rendezvous.

01:17:47.904 --> 01:17:51.240
I did, probably too much,

01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:54.994
but you know how you said that
I should try something new?

01:17:54.995 --> 01:17:57.037
- Mm-hm.
- You were right.

01:17:57.038 --> 01:17:58.956
That's what I'm doing.

01:17:58.957 --> 01:18:00.875
I'm gonna fix my family.

01:18:07.007 --> 01:18:09.756
'Bye, Pamela. Thank
you for everything.

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:18.308
- I'll be right next door.
- OK. OK.

01:18:18.309 --> 01:18:20.056
I have no plans tonight.

01:18:27.109 --> 01:18:29.027
What are you doing here?

01:18:29.028 --> 01:18:32.152
I was in the cafeteria. They
have bitchin' tater tots.

01:18:33.407 --> 01:18:36.534
Aw, you look like hell.

01:18:36.535 --> 01:18:38.828
It's my fault everything
is such a mess.

01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:40.371
Nina won't speak to me.

01:18:40.372 --> 01:18:42.206
My sister got thrown out of school.

01:18:42.207 --> 01:18:44.000
Mom is probably dead.

01:18:44.001 --> 01:18:45.585
Looks like we're finally
making some progress.

01:18:45.586 --> 01:18:47.128
Progress?

01:18:47.129 --> 01:18:49.213
For once, you're thinking about
somebody other than yourself.

01:18:49.214 --> 01:18:51.382
Your mother would be so proud.

01:19:04.896 --> 01:19:06.855
Where is she?

01:19:06.856 --> 01:19:08.729
She dead, child.

01:19:10.902 --> 01:19:12.736
What do you mean, dead?

01:19:12.737 --> 01:19:14.905
Her heart stopped beating.

01:19:14.906 --> 01:19:18.485
They took her down to the
furnace about 20 minutes ago.

01:19:19.452 --> 01:19:22.579
But she can't be dead.
She's my mom.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.329
Well, everybody gotta go sometime.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.413
I'm sure she knew how
much you loved her.

01:19:31.381 --> 01:19:33.799
Mothers always know.

01:19:42.224 --> 01:19:44.347
I don't think she did.

01:19:50.399 --> 01:19:53.526
She'll never know that
Kristen got into Stanford

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:56.987
or that Steven was gay.

01:19:56.988 --> 01:19:59.486
I'm sure she did know that.

01:20:01.118 --> 01:20:04.162
She'll be so pissed
that she was cremated.

01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:07.870
You feed the dog like I asked?

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.169
I'm behind the curtain, stupid.

01:20:15.381 --> 01:20:17.424
I heard you're the
genius that called 911

01:20:17.425 --> 01:20:19.300
instead of letting me die in peace.

01:20:19.301 --> 01:20:21.511
Oh, thank God.

01:20:21.512 --> 01:20:24.639
Oh! At least you know
I'm opprobrious.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.016
Did you bring me any vodka?

01:20:27.017 --> 01:20:29.269
Have you cleaned out the
mini-bar already, Mom?

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.188
Listen, smart-ass, you're gonna
insist I hang around and live,

01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:34.149
I'm gonna do it on my terms.

01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:36.478
Honey, it's gonna take
more than that...

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.739
Do you know where I
could get some of that?

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.159
knock me out.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.662
Four Vicodin and a big
bottle of Stoli might do it.

01:20:47.663 --> 01:20:49.581
I'll be right back.

01:20:51.292 --> 01:20:54.168
You know you're messing
everything up, right?

01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:56.962
- What?
- Don't look so surprised.

01:20:56.963 --> 01:20:58.505
I go through your trash.

01:20:58.506 --> 01:21:00.466
I eavesdrop on your
phone conversations.

01:21:00.467 --> 01:21:02.009
I know what you're up to.

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:03.969
I'll admit,

01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:06.680
the you-fucking-Pam-Bender thing,

01:21:06.681 --> 01:21:08.807
it caught me by surprise,

01:21:08.808 --> 01:21:12.227
but I know more about you

01:21:12.228 --> 01:21:14.146
than you think I do.

01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:15.355
But...

01:21:15.356 --> 01:21:17.691
Shut up and listen to your mother.

01:21:17.692 --> 01:21:22.279
Nothing you've done
cannot be undone.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.451
You go, you tell this Nina
Pennington how you really feel.

01:21:27.452 --> 01:21:29.995
Well, she doesn't
want to talk to me.

01:21:29.996 --> 01:21:32.164
I don't blame her. I was a douche.

01:21:32.165 --> 01:21:37.043
You only get one chance, but... Oh!

01:21:37.044 --> 01:21:39.128
What if I blew that chance?

01:21:39.129 --> 01:21:42.465
Well, you can't make
her forgive you,

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:45.176
but you can do what it takes

01:21:45.177 --> 01:21:47.887
to make things right with her.

01:21:47.888 --> 01:21:51.513
Don't be like your
father... be a man.

01:21:59.858 --> 01:22:02.109
It's like the first time
we've had a conversation

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:04.278
where you were cognisant.

01:22:25.967 --> 01:22:30.470
- Alright, here we go.
- Seriously?

01:22:30.471 --> 01:22:33.682
- Wait! Wait. Can we just...
- Too late.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:36.184
Oh, cunt-licking,
motherfucking whore-cock!

01:22:42.775 --> 01:22:45.402
I totally had you going.

01:22:45.403 --> 01:22:46.945
- You're not gonna maim me?
- No.

01:22:46.946 --> 01:22:49.281
Anyone who can make my
douche bag dad sweat

01:22:49.282 --> 01:22:50.824
is alright by me.

01:22:50.825 --> 01:22:53.242
Oh, thank you so much,
Karlis. Thank you.

01:22:53.243 --> 01:22:55.744
I was an asshole to make
this bet in the first place.

01:22:55.745 --> 01:22:57.955
And, oh, you can tell your family

01:22:57.956 --> 01:23:00.374
that my dad's not a mob
boss... he's just a dick.

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:03.460
Well, I will let my dad think
otherwise for a while.

01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:05.504
- We're good.
- Thank you.

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:12.257
OK, see you.

01:23:17.309 --> 01:23:19.393
I know you must be super busy,

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:22.896
so I really appreciate you
taking the time to meet with me.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:25.232
At the rate your family and
friends keep going to jail,

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.109
you should put me on a
permanent retainer.

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:29.194
It would be cheaper.

01:23:29.195 --> 01:23:31.780
- Did you go to Stanford?
- Best four years of my life.

01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:34.240
Mind you, I'm surprised
I can still walk

01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:36.326
and that I don't have chlamydia.

01:23:36.327 --> 01:23:39.287
Hey, what does that red
seal on the envelope mean?

01:23:39.288 --> 01:23:41.664
If I told you, I'd
have to kill you.

01:23:41.665 --> 01:23:43.833
No, seriously, what you
don't know can't hurt me.

01:23:46.045 --> 01:23:48.838
Are you gonna be able to get
any of those charges dropped?

01:23:48.839 --> 01:23:51.090
I take it you kind
of like this girl.

01:23:51.091 --> 01:23:53.926
A lot, and she wants
nothing to do with me.

01:23:53.927 --> 01:23:56.471
And seeing as I'm the one
that got her in this mess,

01:23:56.472 --> 01:23:58.766
I want to get her out.

01:23:59.892 --> 01:24:01.517
Alright, I'll do it for 2,000.

01:24:01.518 --> 01:24:04.479
$2,000? I don't have that.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.227
How much do you have?

01:24:08.901 --> 01:24:10.735
Around $37.

01:24:10.736 --> 01:24:12.820
But at least I still
have my pinkies.

01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:17.366
Pinkies are overrated,
unless they're in the stink.

01:24:17.367 --> 01:24:19.159
That can be the down payment,

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.745
and for the rest, I am looking
for a part-time file clerk.

01:24:21.746 --> 01:24:25.582
You can work it off, or sell
a kidney. I know a guy.

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:28.411
- I guess I choose file clerk.
- Welcome to the firm.

01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:31.922
Thanks for getting me out.

01:24:31.923 --> 01:24:34.007
Well, Billy, you are my best friend

01:24:34.008 --> 01:24:37.052
and I do feel somewhat responsible.

01:24:37.053 --> 01:24:39.096
Hey, wait, how'd you get the money?

01:24:39.097 --> 01:24:41.223
- He's my bitch now.
- Oh!

01:24:41.224 --> 01:24:44.601
Speaking of bitches, Kevin
Carpenter is still in there.

01:24:44.602 --> 01:24:46.144
How's he doing?

01:24:46.145 --> 01:24:47.688
Let's just say it
wasn't a broomstick

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:49.607
that took his butt cherry.

01:24:51.484 --> 01:24:54.235
Mom! Hey, it's me!

01:24:54.236 --> 01:24:56.779
Hey! Hi!

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.781
Were you coming to get me out?

01:24:58.782 --> 01:25:00.991
Yes, of course I was, darling.

01:25:00.992 --> 01:25:03.285
Who are you? Shouldn't
you be wearing a bra?

01:25:03.286 --> 01:25:04.829
I'm Rick's attorney,

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.747
and his new boss for
the next 20 years.

01:25:06.748 --> 01:25:08.666
Billy, you could take a
lesson from your friend

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:10.209
and get a job yourself.

01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:12.044
That's very responsible
of you, Richard.

01:25:12.045 --> 01:25:14.588
Thanks. OK.

01:25:14.589 --> 01:25:18.426
'Bye, Rick. Hey, Mom,
can we get Slurpees?

01:25:18.427 --> 01:25:20.678
So, make sure to wear your
tight jeans on Monday.

01:25:20.679 --> 01:25:23.098
Yeah, about that...

01:25:24.474 --> 01:25:26.559
What's that?

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.186
Just a rather incriminating
letter to you

01:25:29.187 --> 01:25:31.355
from Father Krumins.

01:25:31.356 --> 01:25:35.608
You know, your friend, the
head of the Lithuanian mafia.

01:25:35.609 --> 01:25:38.653
Are you blackmailing me?

01:25:40.614 --> 01:25:43.283
No, I thought you
should have it back.

01:25:43.284 --> 01:25:45.618
Thanks.

01:25:45.619 --> 01:25:48.788
- And let's make it 10 years.
- Deal.

01:25:48.789 --> 01:25:50.741
See you Monday.

01:26:03.095 --> 01:26:06.055
At least 'Jugs' offered me
$10,000 for a pictorial.

01:26:06.056 --> 01:26:08.183
You're going to hell
in a hand basket.

01:26:08.184 --> 01:26:10.226
Well, she's going
to Stanford first.

01:26:10.227 --> 01:26:12.103
What?

01:26:12.104 --> 01:26:14.354
My boss is an alumni.

01:26:14.355 --> 01:26:16.607
The dean owed her a
favour for some reason.

01:26:16.608 --> 01:26:20.277
- You're not a dick!
- That's my girl.

01:26:20.278 --> 01:26:22.112
That's a pretty big closet.

01:26:22.113 --> 01:26:23.781
And it's time you came out of it.

01:26:23.782 --> 01:26:25.324
What?

01:26:25.325 --> 01:26:27.201
Now you can stop being
mean to everyone

01:26:27.202 --> 01:26:28.744
and just be honest with yourself.

01:26:28.745 --> 01:26:31.747
- And start dressing better.
- We won't love you any less.

01:26:31.748 --> 01:26:34.583
- You knew?
- A mother always knows.

01:26:34.584 --> 01:26:36.126
Besides, you work out your glutes,

01:26:36.127 --> 01:26:37.836
like, five times a week.

01:26:37.837 --> 01:26:40.172
- Here.
- What's this?

01:26:40.173 --> 01:26:42.508
Your divorce papers. All you
have to do is sign them.

01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:47.431
I don't know. I hate the
thought of being alone.

01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:52.726
You're not.

01:26:52.727 --> 01:26:56.145
Oh!

01:26:56.146 --> 01:26:58.523
Ohh!

01:26:58.524 --> 01:27:01.359
Butch.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.445
Even though you didn't die,

01:27:04.446 --> 01:27:06.531
we still remembered
to feed the dog.

01:27:06.532 --> 01:27:09.076
And you've always got us, Mom.

01:27:12.204 --> 01:27:13.997
I need a drink.

Are you OK?

01:27:51.492 --> 01:27:54.578
- Nina, hi. I'm sorry.
- Rick...

01:27:54.579 --> 01:27:57.914
Before you tell me to go away,
just let me tell you one thing.

01:27:57.915 --> 01:28:00.000
Look, I know I messed
everything up,

01:28:00.001 --> 01:28:04.504
I...I have a lot of insecurities

01:28:04.505 --> 01:28:07.257
and I do really stupid
things sometimes.

01:28:07.258 --> 01:28:09.927
Well, a lot of the time.

01:28:11.012 --> 01:28:13.388
All I ever wanted was
for you to like me,

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:17.141
and think that I was cool...
which I'm not.

01:28:17.142 --> 01:28:20.391
I let a lot of stuff get in
the way of the fact that...

01:28:21.813 --> 01:28:23.606
I really like you so much.

01:28:23.607 --> 01:28:25.354
Rick...

01:28:26.943 --> 01:28:29.236
I do think that you're cool.

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:31.280
You do?

01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:34.033
You're right, though...
you are a complete idiot.

01:28:34.034 --> 01:28:37.158
But I like you.

01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:41.040
And I heard what you
said to your family

01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:43.751
and I thought that it
showed a lot of character.

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:46.670
Well, I like to help people.

01:28:48.298 --> 01:28:49.840
Actually I do. It's
not even bullshit.

01:28:49.841 --> 01:28:52.051
It really does...
it does feel good.

01:28:52.052 --> 01:28:55.926
Then I guess we have a lot
more in common than I thought.

01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.887
Go for it.

Annette Stratton-Osborne
welcomes you

01:29:30.339 --> 01:29:34.509
to the grand re-opening
of Pomme-teri,

01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:37.928
where the men are hot
and everything's legal.

01:29:37.929 --> 01:29:41.306
- I'm gay!
- I gathered.

01:29:41.307 --> 01:29:43.642
Alright, ladies, next
up we have a new guy.

01:29:43.643 --> 01:29:47.062
Please give it up for Sparky!

01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:49.898
Whoo! He's young, but he's legal.

01:29:49.899 --> 01:29:54.236
Sparky likes long walks
on the beach and kittens.

01:29:54.237 --> 01:29:57.239
You're Principal Poole's secretary.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.192
And a finger up his ass.

01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:02.703
- Show us some cock!
- No, no, no.

01:30:02.704 --> 01:30:04.913
Oh, no, baby, get back there.

01:30:04.914 --> 01:30:09.084
Sparky! Sparky! Sparky!

01:30:09.085 --> 01:30:12.170
- Not with the plunger.
- Sparky! Sparky! Sparky!

01:30:12.171 --> 01:30:14.381
Oh, Billy Bender!

01:30:14.382 --> 01:30:17.383
Mom? What are you doing here?

01:30:17.384 --> 01:30:20.136
I, uh, my car... broke down.

01:30:20.137 --> 01:30:21.929
- Here's another, Pam.
- Oh, thank you so much.

01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:24.015
You told me to get a job.

01:30:24.016 --> 01:30:27.476
A job where you keep your
clothes on. Look at you.

01:30:27.477 --> 01:30:29.603
Look at you.

01:30:29.604 --> 01:30:31.480
Ladies, I made him do push-ups

01:30:31.481 --> 01:30:33.274
every single day for
the last seven years.

01:30:33.275 --> 01:30:34.817
Huh? Huh?

01:30:34.818 --> 01:30:36.902
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to sit down.

01:30:36.903 --> 01:30:40.406
- Young man, is that a boner?
- Oh!

01:30:40.407 --> 01:30:43.200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:30:43.201 --> 01:30:45.953

01:30:45.954 --> 01:30:48.498
Oh, my God.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.911
I'm gonna be so grounded.

01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.881
Mom?

01:30:57.882 --> 01:31:00.550
I'm not your mother. I am a saint.

01:31:00.551 --> 01:31:03.553
And you, my dear, have been
a very naughty little boy.

01:31:03.554 --> 01:31:05.221
- If it's about the stripping...
- No.

01:31:05.222 --> 01:31:07.265
No, I'm more concerned
with those library books.

01:31:07.266 --> 01:31:09.392
They're very late

01:31:09.393 --> 01:31:12.812
and you're never gonna
get those pages unstuck.
