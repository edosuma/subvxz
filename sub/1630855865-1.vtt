09:38.220 --> 09:40.520
I get how stressful this is,

09:40.720 --> 09:42.900
but I'm pretty sure we can
find a way out of it.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.230
Hold up a second.

09:44.430 --> 09:45.480
Excuse me, son.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.940
- Do you want another drink?
- No, no.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.690
Whenever you get a chance,
could I get another bourbon over here?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.330
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.310
So, look,

09:57.510 --> 10:00.100
have you considered
selling off part of the business?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.500
No.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.290
Just part of it. Okay?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.770
Well, I'm not saying I want to,
but if I did,

10:08.970 --> 10:10.520
where would I find a buyer?

10:10.720 --> 10:13.310
Canada, actually.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.400
They made an inquiry.

10:15.590 --> 10:17.150
Loewen Group? Oh, yeah.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.980
They've been on a pretty significant
acquisition spree.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.350
Going all across the country,

10:22.550 --> 10:26.270
buying up every independently owned
funeral chain they can get their hands on.

10:26.470 --> 10:29.980
These guys, they're really big players.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.520
Now, you know how I feel
about these big corporations, now.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.100
Yes, I do. But all I'm saying is
it's an option.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.000
And it's out there.

10:39.950 --> 10:41.790
Might be a way out.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.040
You could think about it.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.270
- (plane flying overhead)
- (car horns honking)

10:49.470 --> 10:50.980
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

10:51.180 --> 10:52.690
Jerry.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.350
Perfect timing.

10:54.550 --> 10:57.060
- Hey, you need a hand with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.560
Hey, so, listen.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.020
You're sure about this, right?

11:00.220 --> 11:01.940
No, I've given this a lot of thought,

11:02.140 --> 11:03.850
and I believe this is
the right thing to do for my family.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.100
All righty, then.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.770
Next stop, Vancouver.
You ready to go inside?

11:06.970 --> 11:08.350
No, we got to wait for Hal.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.270
- Who?
- I told you about Hal.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.650
He's a friend of my son's from college,

11:11.840 --> 11:13.150
very bright young man

11:13.340 --> 11:15.400
just getting started out
as a lawyer and, uh...

11:15.590 --> 11:16.980
Well, hell, here he comes now.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.400
Recently passed the bar exam.

11:19.590 --> 11:21.480
Hungry for experience.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.230
Who, which one?

11:23.430 --> 11:25.900
That tall kid?

11:26.090 --> 11:29.100
Hey, hey, sorry.
So sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. Um...

11:29.300 --> 11:31.270
My taxi just dropped me off
at the wrong terminal, so...

11:31.470 --> 11:34.620
Oh, don't worry about it. Halbert Dockins,
I want you to meet Mike Allred.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.600
Really great to meet you, Mr. Allred.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.230
I'm very excited
to be a member of the team.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.810
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.480
So you're a lawyer?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.480
(chuckles) Uh, yeah.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.400
Well, that's just great.
Good for you, son.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.370
I'll see you guys inside.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.580
Come on. We're going to Canada.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.100
BOB:
<i>I work for Ray Loewen.</i>

12:00.300 --> 12:01.810
<i>He's really looking forward</i>
<i>to meeting you.</i>

12:02.010 --> 12:03.440
As I'm sure you can gather,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.310
Ray's a very hands-on kind of guy.

12:05.510 --> 12:08.310
One of the only CEOs in the industry

12:08.510 --> 12:10.330
who likes to meet with
every seller personally.

12:11.410 --> 12:12.730
Hey, Ray!

12:12.930 --> 12:15.730
Allow me to introduce Mr. Jeremiah O'Keefe

12:15.930 --> 12:18.400
- and his colleagues.
- It is a pleasure to meet you, Jerry.

12:18.590 --> 12:22.980
So, boys, how do you like the way we do
business up here in Canada? (laughing)

12:23.180 --> 12:25.400
Come on on board. Get you a drink.

12:25.590 --> 12:27.400
(seabirds screeching)

12:27.590 --> 12:30.980
BOB:
At present, we own 1,115 funeral homes,

12:31.180 --> 12:32.520
427 cemeteries,

12:32.720 --> 12:36.160
354 insurance companies.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.730
RAY:
My strategy is simple.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.980
Buy as many funeral homes as I can

12:41.180 --> 12:43.350
and put myself in a position

12:43.550 --> 12:46.190
for what I like to call

12:46.390 --> 12:48.950
the Golden Era of Death.

12:50.790 --> 12:51.900
Sorry?

12:52.090 --> 12:54.060
It's when all the baby boomers
across the U.S.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.350
finally reach their age of demise.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.850
RAY:
Resulting in a minimum 60% increase

13:00.050 --> 13:02.400
in death rates nationwide.

13:02.590 --> 13:06.520
Do you have any idea how many people
are living in the U.S.,

13:06.720 --> 13:08.770
right now,

13:08.970 --> 13:10.790
over the age of 65?

13:12.870 --> 13:15.100
51 million.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.480
(Bob and Ray laugh)

13:17.680 --> 13:18.810
JEREMIAH:
That sounds kind of cynical to me.

13:19.010 --> 13:21.060
Aren't you worried
about losing sight of your customer?

13:21.260 --> 13:22.150
RAY:
My customer?

13:22.340 --> 13:24.290
What customer?
My customers are dead guys.

13:25.450 --> 13:26.790
(laughing)

13:28.500 --> 13:30.100
I'm just kidding.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.370
I'm just kidding, Jerry.

13:33.330 --> 13:36.850
Look, the more funeral homes I own,

13:37.050 --> 13:38.440
the more money I make,

13:38.640 --> 13:41.600
the more I am able to meet the demands
of my customer.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.370
And provide for his... growing needs.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.270
Maybe it's time that we drop
all this chit-chat

13:51.470 --> 13:53.150
and start talking about a deal.
What do you say, gentlemen?

13:53.340 --> 13:56.020
I'm interested to hear
what you have in mind, Ray.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.020
My understanding

13:58.220 --> 13:59.690
is that you're having a bit of trouble

13:59.890 --> 14:01.520
with the state regulators down there.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.980
How'd you come to that understanding?

14:04.180 --> 14:06.230
RAY:
You own... what?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.690
Nine homes across the state?

14:07.890 --> 14:08.810
JEREMIAH:
Eight.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.480
I own eight funeral homes
across the state.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.730
And my insurance business, of course.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.940
So what about this?

14:17.140 --> 14:19.770
You sell me three of your homes,

14:19.970 --> 14:22.190
at a fair market value
to be agreed upon later.

14:22.390 --> 14:25.650
Then, not only do you get to keep

14:25.840 --> 14:27.810
the bulk of your assets,

14:28.010 --> 14:30.350
but it would also provide you
with more than enough fresh cash

14:30.550 --> 14:32.350
to deal with the regulators.

14:32.550 --> 14:34.790
Now, there's something else
I want out of this deal.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.980
I make most of my profits
from selling burial insurance.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.060
There's no way I can survive
if you have a monopoly

14:42.260 --> 14:44.060
on that, too, so what I propose

14:44.260 --> 14:46.150
is that I sell you
three of my funeral homes,

14:46.340 --> 14:47.950
fair market value...

14:49.330 --> 14:51.020
...but you're going to have to promise,
here and now,

14:51.220 --> 14:54.830
to no longer sell burial insurance
in southern Mississippi.

15:07.870 --> 15:09.370
Okay.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.310
So does this mean we have a deal?

15:14.510 --> 15:16.650
I'll get my lawyers
to draw up the contracts

15:16.840 --> 15:18.580
so we can get it done immediately.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.020
What the hell is taking so long?

15:26.220 --> 15:27.350
We closed on this deal, um...

15:27.550 --> 15:28.770
Coming up on four months now.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.810
They keep trying to re-trade the terms.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.480
When we left Vancouver,
they said it would take 30 days max.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.190
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I don't know, makes perfect sense to me.

15:37.390 --> 15:38.370
MIKE:
Why?

15:39.830 --> 15:41.310
Have you considered the possibility

15:41.510 --> 15:44.600
that Loewen has no intention
of closing this deal at all?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.900
Son, with all due respect,
you don't have the faintest idea

15:48.090 --> 15:49.230
what you're talking about.

15:49.430 --> 15:50.440
I think I do.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.270
Think about it.

15:52.470 --> 15:54.810
The longer he stalls,
the worse you're screwed.

15:55.010 --> 15:57.020
First, the insurance commission
takes your license,

15:57.220 --> 15:58.650
effectively destroying your livelihood,

15:58.840 --> 16:01.980
until, sooner or later, you have no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.

16:02.180 --> 16:04.520
Now not only does Loewen get
the three homes,

16:04.720 --> 16:06.730
he can actually buy your entire business
out from under you

16:06.930 --> 16:08.150
at yard-sale prices.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.980
You really think
he's trying to bankrupt me?

16:10.180 --> 16:12.310
Hell, he can't do that;
I got a signed contract.

16:12.510 --> 16:15.020
It was only signed on our end.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.730
With no closing date attached.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.190
And, by the way, I heard Mr. Loewen

16:18.390 --> 16:19.770
is actually still selling insurance
in the region.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.850
Oh, come on.
Stop with the conspiracy theories.

16:22.050 --> 16:25.020
Son, I'm sorry,
but you really are paranoid.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.100
Okay.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.190
Um...

16:27.390 --> 16:29.020
would you mind doing me a favor?

16:29.220 --> 16:31.810
Would you mind stop calling me son?

16:32.010 --> 16:35.480
I am not your son, Mike.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.650
Whoa.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.520
Just take it easy, okay?

16:38.720 --> 16:40.440
You really want to be taken seriously

16:40.640 --> 16:42.350
- as a lawyer in this town?
- Okay. Who says I'm not?

16:42.550 --> 16:44.370
Enough of that, y'all.

16:47.500 --> 16:51.480
Do you really think Mr. Loewen has the
intention of running me into the ground?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.940
I do.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.730
Why the hell should he be
on our clock anyway?

16:55.930 --> 16:58.350
Well, that's it. I'm gonna sue him.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.480
You've never sued anybody before
in your whole life.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.600
Well, I'm liable to,
just about any minute now.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.900
Yeah. Well, you think 75 years of age
is a good time to start suing people?

17:08.090 --> 17:10.690
Old men don't file lawsuits.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.690
The way I see it, if somebody tries
to take advantage of you,

17:13.890 --> 17:16.520
and you know it's wrong,
it don't matter how old you are.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.480
This fellow tried to bully me
out of business.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.120
And I don't think
I should be expected to stand for it.

<i>You won't believe</i>

<i>personal injury lawyer Willie E. Gary,</i>

18:16.930 --> 18:20.310
<i>a man who refused to accept</i>
<i>a life sentence of poverty</i>

18:20.510 --> 18:23.190
<i>because he believed in the American dream.</i>

18:23.390 --> 18:25.480
<i>Born to a family of migrant sharecroppers</i>

18:25.680 --> 18:28.060
<i>working the sugarcane fields of Florida,</i>

18:28.260 --> 18:31.560
<i>life wasn't always a bed of roses</i>
<i>for Willie Gary.</i>

18:31.760 --> 18:34.560
I just always had this burning desire
to be something, you know?

18:34.760 --> 18:36.600
And I-I knew I was going
to make something of myself.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.230
LEACH:
<i>And make something of himself he did,</i>

18:38.430 --> 18:41.650
<i>as now Willie regularly wins</i>
<i>multimillion-dollar cases...</i>

18:41.840 --> 18:45.100
Are you suggesting I hire this guy

18:45.300 --> 18:46.770
Seems like a crazy idea,

18:46.970 --> 18:49.850

Willie Gary told you that.

<i>Never forgetting his roots...</i>

19:26.800 --> 19:27.750

19:28.830 --> 19:31.230
Believe it or not, he's got
an absolutely flawless trial record.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.270
He supposedly hasn't lost a case
in over 12 years.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.770
What does he know about contract law?

19:35.970 --> 19:37.440
This is a contract law case.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.520
The case was filed down in Hinds County.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.350
That's a three-to-one Black/white ratio.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.980
That means there's a 70% chance
we'll get a Black judge,

19:45.180 --> 19:46.730
and if we do go to trial,

19:46.930 --> 19:48.650
likely a Black jury as well.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.060
- So what?
- With all due respect,

19:51.260 --> 19:54.730
you-you can't put a guy like Mike Allred
in front of a Black jury.

19:54.930 --> 19:56.810
Why the hell not?

19:57.010 --> 19:58.520
He has been my attorney for 30 years.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.980
He knows contract law better than anybody.

20:01.180 --> 20:02.770
You're really gonna
make me spell this out.

20:02.970 --> 20:04.080
Um...

20:06.700 --> 20:11.790
He literally reeks self-satisfied,
good ol' boy Southern bigotry.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.520
I mean, a Black jury sees
a guy like that coming...

20:16.720 --> 20:20.150
The idea of us pandering to a jury
like that, Hal, it's not...

20:20.340 --> 20:21.940
It... (sighs)

20:22.140 --> 20:25.020
This is not a discrimination suit.

20:25.220 --> 20:29.120
You and I both know
that race has nothing to do with this.

20:33.450 --> 20:36.150
I happen to know, for a fact,
that Mr. Gary is trying a case

20:36.340 --> 20:37.950
down in Florida this week.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.810
What if... what if...

20:42.010 --> 20:43.810
you and I went down there,
just for the day,

20:44.010 --> 20:45.750
and try to meet him in person?

20:47.370 --> 20:49.310
Essentially, we just want
to hold the Loewen Group

20:49.510 --> 20:50.940
responsible for their actions.

20:51.140 --> 20:52.350
WILLIE:
Nah, nah, nah. That ain't what you want.

20:52.550 --> 20:53.980
What you want to do
is you want to make 'em pay.

20:54.180 --> 20:55.480
- REGGIE: Make 'em hurt,
make 'em pay. -Yeah, yeah.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.400
So, how much money y'all trying
to get, hmm?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.810
- JEREMIAH: Uh, $6 million.
- $6 million.

21:00.010 --> 21:03.480
That's full, fair market value
plus damages,

21:03.680 --> 21:08.650
and I've already filed a civil claim
in Hinds County, Mississippi.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.480
HAL:
Well?

21:10.680 --> 21:13.290
What-what do you think, Mr. Gary?
Do you like the case?

21:15.370 --> 21:16.980
I'm gonna give you my personal opinion.

21:17.180 --> 21:18.560
Honest.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.730
Look, Mr. O'Keefe, I'm sorry for
what this Loewen guy did to you--

21:22.930 --> 21:25.350
he sounds like he's a big asshole
and everything like that--

21:25.550 --> 21:28.310
but, um, this ain't no Willie Gary case.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.100
It just ain't. It ain't...

21:30.300 --> 21:31.440
It ain't a Willie Gary case.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.100
Uh, wait, what-what do you mean?
Why-why not?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.100
It ain't a Willie Gary case

21:35.300 --> 21:37.230
- 'cause it ain't for Willie Gary.
- No, but...

21:37.430 --> 21:39.440
I'm sorry,
what is a "Willie Gary case," then?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.850
- I don't...
- In other words, what he's saying is

21:41.050 --> 21:43.690
a Willie Gary case is the type of case
where I have the upper hand.

21:43.890 --> 21:47.190
Where I feel that I can take
this case to trial. Understand?

21:47.390 --> 21:49.310
- All the way.
- And-and once I get 'em in that trial,

21:49.510 --> 21:50.600
I mean, y'all seen my tape.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.350
When I get 'em in front of--
especially in front of people

21:52.550 --> 21:54.480
that-that look like me--
I'm-a play 'em like a symphony.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.940
Mm. Mozart.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.980
A Willie Gary case is
where I could take that judgement

21:59.180 --> 22:02.060
and push it all the way up,
to the heavens if I need to,

22:02.260 --> 22:04.440
and get as much money as I can
for my client.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.690
Uh, what he's saying is,
a Willie Gary case

22:06.890 --> 22:08.020
is a case we know we can win.

22:08.220 --> 22:09.690
This case... not so much.

22:09.890 --> 22:12.450
Matter of fact,
your case a little bit iffy.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.190
And, uh...

22:16.390 --> 22:17.810
the other thing is this.

22:18.010 --> 22:20.040
Don't take this the wrong way, but, uh...

22:21.540 --> 22:24.480
He, uh, he's-- you're white-- he's white.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.810
And I don't have white clients.

22:28.010 --> 22:30.650
I've never had any, so...

22:30.840 --> 22:35.540
No offense or anything like that,
but this is just unusual for me.

22:36.700 --> 22:39.580
No offense taken, Mr. Gary.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.980
That guy's too rich and famous
for us, Halbert.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.560
Uh-huh.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.980
Um, you know what, Mr. O'Keefe?
Just, um...

22:47.180 --> 22:48.310
- What?
- You know, just-just give me one second.

22:48.510 --> 22:49.520
- All right?
- Where you going?

22:49.720 --> 22:50.850
I'm-I'm gonna talk with him one more time.

22:51.050 --> 22:52.270
G-Give me five minutes, okay?

22:52.470 --> 22:54.060
The green light scenario,

22:54.260 --> 22:56.980
when I was talking to the,
the one juror, uh, uh...

22:57.180 --> 22:58.440
What'd she have on?

22:58.640 --> 23:00.400
I'd have maybe looked at her
a little bit longer.

23:00.590 --> 23:01.730
You know, gave her some eye contact.

23:01.930 --> 23:03.520
- Sometimes you got to romance them.
- Listen, I'm not...

23:03.720 --> 23:05.350
- That's the thing, I don't know that...
- Look, Mr. Gary,

23:05.550 --> 23:07.350
I'm so sorry to come back in here
like this, I really am,

23:07.550 --> 23:09.190
- but I just need a minute of your time.
- WILLIE: What's going on with you, man?

23:09.390 --> 23:10.900
- You lost? Huh?
- Yeah. Lost your mind...

23:11.090 --> 23:12.770
Or did he fire your ass
out there by the elevator?

23:12.970 --> 23:15.520
Okay, yeah, maybe so,
but listen, I... I...

23:15.720 --> 23:17.650
- I just need a minute of your time.
- You need a minute?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.650
- One minute. That's all I ask.
- Well, you know what, that's all you got.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.060
'Cause we busy. Then, come on, Hal.

23:21.260 --> 23:23.940
I mean, Jerry's a... a dream client.

23:24.140 --> 23:25.730
He's got a great narrative.

23:25.930 --> 23:27.020
He's a war hero.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.560
A decorated war hero.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.270
He served in World War II.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.270
- He was, he was awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross... -Yeah.

23:32.470 --> 23:34.370
- ...for service for his country.
- Hmm.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.400
- Is that all you got?
- Man.

23:36.590 --> 23:37.560
That's it?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.900
- Wasn't World War II about 50 years ago?
- Yeah, man.

23:41.090 --> 23:43.270
- Hal, don't nobody give a shit
except them. -That's old news, nigga.

23:43.470 --> 23:44.690
All right. All right. How about this?

23:44.890 --> 23:46.020
Okay, um...

23:46.220 --> 23:48.270
In 1976,

23:48.470 --> 23:52.900
Jerry was serving as a two-term mayor
in his hometown of Biloxi.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.900
The KKK tried to organize a march...

23:55.090 --> 23:57.730
And he stopped 'em
from buying white sheets.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.250
(Willie and Reggie laughing)

24:00.410 --> 24:02.400
- Shit, man.
- I guess, I guess he's supposed to be

24:02.590 --> 24:04.650
- our white savior now. (laughs)

No, that's not my point. I'm saying we're
hopefully trying the case in Hinds County.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.150
- There's a three-to-one...
- Hold-hold on. Let me stop you, Hal.

24:13.340 --> 24:16.560
Now, listen, Hal, I like you--
I-I think you come from good stock--

24:16.760 --> 24:18.150
but you got to understand
how we work here.

24:18.340 --> 24:21.190
One, we don't do contract law.

24:21.390 --> 24:24.150
- Two, we don't have no white clients.
- REGGIE: No.

24:24.340 --> 24:26.940
And three, that ain't enough money.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.770
My, not enough money.

24:28.970 --> 24:31.060
It ain't enough money, Hal.
You know, I-I-I love you, man,

24:31.260 --> 24:32.770
but it ain't enough money for us.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.730

- Gold finish?
- Got to see it.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.900

- REGGIE: It's the big time, baby.

24:40.090 --> 24:42.100

$30 million,

24:42.300 --> 24:43.730
- $80 million cases monthly.
- Yeah.

24:43.930 --> 24:45.150
HAL:
Okay. Okay.

24:45.340 --> 24:48.080
But how do you know this case
can't be something bigger?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.350
Well...

24:50.550 --> 24:52.690
we don't know.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.620
You know something we don't?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.600
Ray Loewen happens to sit at the top

24:58.800 --> 25:01.770
of one of the biggest industries
in this country.

25:01.970 --> 25:02.940
Hmm.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.450
I'm talking about the $20 billion a year
death care industry.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.270
There are two huge corporations moving in
and taking over everything,

25:10.470 --> 25:12.230
and the Loewen Group is one of them.

25:12.430 --> 25:16.600
Now, what they did to Jerry
is truly terrible, but...

25:16.800 --> 25:18.730
I have a feeling it's just... it's-it...

25:18.930 --> 25:22.120
No. I know. It's the tip of the iceberg.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.350
- Hmm.
- HAL: Can I keep going?

25:25.550 --> 25:26.690
Sure. Shit.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.730
Well, that's where you should've started.

25:28.930 --> 25:31.480

$80 million cases, and...

25:31.680 --> 25:33.600

whoop your ass now.

28:11.050 --> 28:12.150
This your war room here, huh?

28:12.340 --> 28:14.770
- Uh, well, we got the conference room,
you know. -Mm-hmm.

28:14.970 --> 28:18.100
I like these over there.
I like these books. I like all those.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.520
This is nice, though.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.900
(clears throat)
Before we get to work, though...

28:22.090 --> 28:24.270
I hope this doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable, but, uh...

28:24.470 --> 28:25.900
I got some questions I got to ask you.

28:26.090 --> 28:28.310
Oh, sure. Feel free to ask me anything.
I'm all ears.

28:28.510 --> 28:29.520
Good.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.310
Um, question is, uh...

28:32.510 --> 28:34.540
how do you feel
about working with Black folk?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.040
Man-to-man?

28:39.040 --> 28:40.150
Is there any other way?

28:40.340 --> 28:42.100
No, sir. You want an honest answer?

28:42.300 --> 28:43.600
- I need that.
- All right.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.850
Well, if you want an honest answer,

28:46.050 --> 28:48.150
truth be told,
I suppose I am a little prejudiced.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.270
Mm. Okay.

28:49.470 --> 28:50.480
I'm not saying I'm proud of it
or anything.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.900
- I appreciate your honesty.
- In fact, I've been working real hard

28:53.090 --> 28:54.020
on trying to overcome it.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.600
Mm. Well, then you should.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.270
- I'm glad you're working on it.
- But yes.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.730
Did you meet my team?

28:59.930 --> 29:02.230
Hi. I'm Chris.

29:02.430 --> 29:03.600
Hi, Chris.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.270
Yes. Dashaan.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.480
- Dashaan.
- Mm.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.290
Al.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.700
Reggie Douglas.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.950
Gentlemen.

29:14.410 --> 29:16.940
Okay. Uh...
now that that's all cleared up,

29:17.140 --> 29:18.480
why don't we all just head over
to the conference room,

29:18.680 --> 29:20.350
where the rest of the team
is waiting, yeah?

29:20.550 --> 29:22.980
Jerry. We're gonna work this out,
all right?

29:23.180 --> 29:24.480
- Yeah.
- He's gonna be okay.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.000
Okay, that's fine.

29:27.870 --> 29:29.690
WILLIE:
Afternoon, gentlemen. How you feeling?

29:29.890 --> 29:31.690
You good? Huh? Good, good, good.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.730
For all y'all that don't know who I am,
my name is Willie Gary.

29:34.930 --> 29:36.230
Tell 'em who you are.

29:36.430 --> 29:39.400
Now, I done brought a couple of partners
of mine from my firm up here from Florida

29:39.590 --> 29:41.150
to help y'all win this case.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.900
And for all of y'all who are unfamiliar
with the Willie Gary style of litigation,

29:45.090 --> 29:46.150
let me break it down to you.

29:46.340 --> 29:48.060
We 'bout to go to war.

29:48.260 --> 29:50.230
'Cause that's what I think litigation is.

29:50.430 --> 29:52.020
Litigation is war.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.270
It's a battle, a battle to the death.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.150
And I'm not talking about
no bullshit, either;

29:56.340 --> 29:59.580
I'm talking about some
Jean-Claude Van Damme ass-kicking shit.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.080
Now I know y'all looking at me crazy,
but that's how I like to get.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.650
And if we don't get crazy
with these motherfuckers,

30:06.840 --> 30:08.230
I'm telling you, this Loewen Group?

30:08.430 --> 30:09.600
They're powerful.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.730
Got a lot of money,
got a lot of influence.

30:11.930 --> 30:13.980
They have everything that we don't.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.650
But we not gonna let them intimidate us.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.620
'Cause I'm not intimidated.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.020
Now, it ain't no secret.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.440
For the past 12 years,
I have not lost a case.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.850
And why is that?

30:26.050 --> 30:27.060
Can you tell me why?

30:27.260 --> 30:28.600
'Cause I hate to lose.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.830
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

30:32.030 --> 30:34.190
I'd rather somebody pull a gun on me
and blow my head off

30:34.390 --> 30:36.200
than to lose a case.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.330
Now, that being said...

30:41.620 --> 30:43.730
...there's one thing I'm-a tell you
I'm not gonna bend on.

30:43.930 --> 30:48.060
I do not plan on settling this case.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.060
- We don't do that, no.
- MIKE: Excuse me.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.560
Anyone mind if I say something here?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.480
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Mr. Gary,

30:54.680 --> 30:57.600
when it comes to the matter of settling,
I'm afraid that's not at all

30:57.800 --> 30:59.400
the strategy we've developed here.

30:59.590 --> 31:03.690
In fact, I've already drafted
a letter to Mr. Loewen

31:03.890 --> 31:06.650
offering to settle at $8 million.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.520
Though, just between us here in this room,

31:08.720 --> 31:11.100
we'd probably be willing to drop
to seven if need be.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.400
WILLIE:
Well, Mike, thank you for the update--

31:12.590 --> 31:15.600
appreciate that--
but, unfortunately, things have changed.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.600
We're not settling.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.350
No matter what you said,

31:19.550 --> 31:21.480
the discussion is still on the table

31:21.680 --> 31:24.950
and will remain so until I've decided
what the best course is.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.020
Huh.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.950
Till you decided, huh?

31:32.410 --> 31:33.690
What's going on here, Mike?

31:33.890 --> 31:35.790
Hmm? Who's in charge?

31:36.790 --> 31:38.810
No, seriously, who's in charge?

31:39.010 --> 31:41.230
'Cause you done have Willie Gary
come down here to take over the case

31:41.430 --> 31:43.310
and now here you're telling me
what you're gonna do.

31:43.510 --> 31:46.400
I said we're not settling the case
and that comes from the lead attorney.

31:46.590 --> 31:47.560
- Come again?
- Come again what?

31:47.760 --> 31:50.150
What's the matter?
You need your ears checked or something?

31:50.340 --> 31:51.480
Excuse me, sir.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.730
- No, you're not.
- Mike, you raise a finger to me,

31:52.930 --> 31:54.150
- you'll get your ass whupped in here.
- Boss, calm down.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.690
- MIKE: Believe me, Mr. Gary, you are not
lead attorney. -AL: Come on, settle down.

31:56.890 --> 31:57.940
- Then what am I, then?
- May I remind you

31:58.140 --> 31:59.560
- you are in my town...
- Your town?

31:59.760 --> 32:01.480
- ...sitting at my conference table...
- Every town I go to, Mike, is my town.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.150
- ...across the table from my client.
- Evidently it ain't your town,

32:03.340 --> 32:04.940
- or they wouldn't have called me.
- JEREMIAH: Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

32:05.140 --> 32:08.700
Gentlemen, could y'all
let the temperature down a little bit?

32:11.120 --> 32:13.350
WILLIE:
I didn't come here to fight you, Mike.

32:13.550 --> 32:15.940
- MIKE: What?
- I said, I didn't come here to fight you.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.290
I came here to get a job done.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.810
Now, Mr. O'Keefe...

32:21.010 --> 32:23.480
Last I checked, he wants to win this case.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.750
Not toot his ass up in the air
for a funky little $8 million.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.790
Like a bitch.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.350
MIKE:
<i>Jesus Christ, Jerry. What's going on?</i>

32:35.550 --> 32:37.350
I think we ought to give him a chance.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.770
Did you hear that speech he just gave?

32:38.970 --> 32:40.020
He has no idea what he's doing.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.310
He hasn't lost a case in 12 years.

32:42.510 --> 32:43.980
For personal injury cases.

32:44.180 --> 32:46.830
He clearly has no idea about real law,
about contract law.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.600
What about lead attorney?

32:50.800 --> 32:52.900
You're not considering
giving him lead attorney.

32:53.090 --> 32:54.370
Yeah.

32:55.330 --> 32:57.120
I am.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.520
We good?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.770
(sighs) Yeah.

33:08.970 --> 33:10.400
Mike, you good?

33:10.590 --> 33:12.440
All right, since we're all good,

33:12.640 --> 33:16.650
uh, does anybody here mind, uh,
taking some dictation?

33:16.840 --> 33:19.650
Cynthia, would you mind
taking dictation for Mr. Gary?

33:19.840 --> 33:22.690
WILLIE:
All right, Cynthia. I sure appreciate it.

33:22.890 --> 33:24.190
All right.

33:24.390 --> 33:25.770
Address to Mr. Ray Loewen,

33:25.970 --> 33:29.020
Chairman, Loewen Group.

33:29.220 --> 33:31.310
Dear Mr. Loewen,
my name is Willie E. Gary.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.190
I've just been appointed lead counsel

33:34.390 --> 33:38.560
in the suit brought against you
by Jeremiah O'Keefe.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.520
In regards to the prior settlement,

33:41.720 --> 33:46.020
the offer you received of $8 million,

33:46.220 --> 33:49.190
I hereby rescind that offer.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.150
As of the date of this new letter we have,

33:52.340 --> 33:57.730
the new offer is
in the amount of $100 million.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.810
- Whoo. That's what I'm talking about.
- (scattered laughter)

34:00.010 --> 34:01.520
Did he just say $100 million?

34:01.720 --> 34:03.350
- As in eight zeros?
- $100 million.

34:03.550 --> 34:05.350
Why don't y'all just relax?
Hear what I'm saying?

34:05.550 --> 34:08.100
It's literally $94 million more
than our original claim.

34:08.300 --> 34:11.060
Sounds to me like your original claim
was about $94 million short.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.400
Uh, yeah, Mr. Gary, perhaps you could

34:12.590 --> 34:13.900
- help us understand...
- MIKE: $100 million?

34:14.090 --> 34:15.230
It's absurd and you know it.

34:15.430 --> 34:17.190
What you trying to do, destroy this case?

34:17.390 --> 34:20.480
Mike, anybody ever tell you
you got balls the size of a garden slug?

34:20.680 --> 34:23.600
W-Willie, I'm afraid that I agree
with everybody's concerns.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.650
That's a hell of a lot of money.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.150
We throw out a number like that,
we're gonna humiliate ourselves.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.850
WILLIE:
Listen, I understand how you feel, Jerry.

34:31.050 --> 34:32.520
But you got to trust me, okay?

34:32.720 --> 34:34.560
- Mm-hmm. Trust him.
- Okay?

34:34.760 --> 34:36.270
Everybody's got to trust me.

34:36.470 --> 34:37.940
- All right?
- REGGIE: Amen.

34:38.140 --> 34:39.870
Now, Cynthia, where were we?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.400
MAN:
<i>"Starting as of the date of this letter,</i>

34:42.590 --> 34:44.600
<i>"our new settlement demand is now</i>

34:44.800 --> 34:46.940
$100 million."

34:47.140 --> 34:48.350
- (men laughing) -(man whistles)
- MAN 2: Oh, what?

34:48.550 --> 34:50.230
MAN 3:
Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me.

34:50.430 --> 34:51.600
- $100 million?
- MAN 4: Who the hell does he think he is?

34:51.800 --> 34:52.690
- MAN 2: Is he crazy?
- MAN: Eight zeros, did you count that?

34:52.890 --> 34:55.230
- Eight zeros.
- There's no way that is not a joke.

34:55.430 --> 34:57.770
- That is a joke.
- It looks like a fucking dozen eggs.

34:57.970 --> 34:58.850
(laughter)

34:59.050 --> 35:00.700
No joke.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.230
Jesus Christ, this O'Keefe guy,
he's a piece of work, no?

35:04.430 --> 35:06.060
Yeah.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.060
Who is this clown he's hired as a lawyer?

35:08.260 --> 35:11.150
Apparently, some guy
by the name of William Gary.

35:11.340 --> 35:14.060
Thank you, Bob, I also read the letter.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.230
But my question is,

35:16.430 --> 35:17.650
who is he?

35:17.840 --> 35:18.980
What's his story?

35:19.180 --> 35:20.690
Where did O'Keefe find him?

35:20.890 --> 35:23.190
From what we could dig up,

35:23.390 --> 35:26.350
he's this kind of flashy
personal injury lawyer,

35:26.550 --> 35:28.060
uh, out of Florida.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.600
- Ambulance-chaser type.
- Personal injury?

35:29.800 --> 35:31.230
This is a contract dispute.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.230
Why the hell would he hire
a personal injury lawyer

35:34.430 --> 35:36.230
for a contract dispute?

35:36.430 --> 35:38.270
Maybe they don't have any regular lawyers

35:38.470 --> 35:40.230
(Southern accent):
down in backwater Mississippi.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.310
You should talk like that more.

35:42.510 --> 35:44.600
Turns out, the case was filed
in some remote county

35:44.800 --> 35:47.100
in the lower region of the state,
called Hinds County.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.730
RAY:
Yeah? So?

35:48.930 --> 35:51.770
So, Hinds County also happens to be

35:51.970 --> 35:55.450
one of the poorest, and about 70%, uh...

35:56.540 --> 35:58.060
...Black.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.060
Oh.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.660
So that's why he was hired.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.370
Because he's Black.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.660
Gary's Black.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.190
He's an African American man.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.850
- she's a Black woman.
- She's a sister.

37:12.050 --> 37:13.350
Well, what do you know?

37:13.550 --> 37:16.940
We done got out-Blacked
and out-womaned, all in one go. (chuckles)

37:17.140 --> 37:19.080
("Hold On" continues)

37:23.910 --> 37:26.730
Graduated top of her class
from Harvard Law School.

37:26.930 --> 37:28.500
Jesus Christ.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.770
Then went on to clerk two years

37:33.970 --> 37:37.750
for Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.900
Three years associate at Paul, Weiss

37:43.090 --> 37:46.310
and now currently
the youngest partner ever

37:46.510 --> 37:48.190
at Cranston, Brown and Atwell.

37:48.390 --> 37:49.650
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, that's impressive.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.350
Friend of mine used to work with her,
over at C, B and A.

37:52.550 --> 37:53.810
And, um...

37:54.010 --> 37:55.770
well...

37:55.970 --> 37:58.850
he told me they had a nickname for her
around the office.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.060
Mm. What was it?

38:00.260 --> 38:01.400
Ain't that right?

38:01.590 --> 38:03.980
"The Python." (chuckles)

38:04.180 --> 38:06.900
On account of her
particular style during cross?

38:07.090 --> 38:08.690
- Yes. Yes.
- You know, how she used to strike

38:08.890 --> 38:10.520
- when you least expect it.
- (murmuring)

38:10.720 --> 38:12.310
Mm-hmm. Okay, Ms. Python.

38:12.510 --> 38:13.980
- But you know what?
- REGGIE: Very descriptive.

38:14.180 --> 38:15.690
You know what?

38:15.890 --> 38:18.270
I'm the boa constrictor. (grunts)

38:18.470 --> 38:19.650
REGGIE:
Let's see what she got.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.810
ANNETTE: <i>I think we may need</i>
<i>to call the cable company.</i>

38:23.010 --> 38:24.940
Every time I try
and turn on Turner Broadcast,

38:25.140 --> 38:27.770
it's just some weird, empty screen.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.810
Think there's something wrong with it.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.230
There's nothing wrong with it.
I canceled the subscription.

38:32.430 --> 38:35.100
What do you mean, you canceled it?

38:35.300 --> 38:38.560
Annie, those insurance regulators
came by again the other day.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.480
They suspended my license this time.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.810
I'm gonna have to shut the business
down for a while.

38:45.010 --> 38:46.250
What?

38:47.450 --> 38:48.690
What are you talking about?

38:48.890 --> 38:50.690
It's only temporary.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.400
Soon as we get this trial over with,
Loewen makes his restitution,

38:53.590 --> 38:55.270
- we gonna be up and...
- Jerry. Jerry.

38:55.470 --> 38:56.850
You hear yourself?

38:57.050 --> 39:00.080
As soon as Ray Loewen makes restitution?

39:02.410 --> 39:04.910
Do you really know for sure
that's even gonna happen?

39:08.950 --> 39:12.580
I mean, you still haven't told me
how we're paying for all this.

39:13.660 --> 39:16.940
That fancy new lawyer
you just brought in from Florida.

39:17.140 --> 39:19.600
You don't have to worry about him.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.810
(soft chuckle)

39:22.010 --> 39:27.060
Well, I just don't understand why you're
continuing with this ridiculous lawsuit.

39:27.260 --> 39:29.150
You can find another buyer

39:29.340 --> 39:30.900
for those three homes.

39:31.090 --> 39:32.500
You know that.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.520
Clearly, this is about
something else for you.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.850
Maybe it is.

39:37.050 --> 39:39.100
Maybe I just don't want
to see him get away with it.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.700
Who? Ray Loewen?

39:42.830 --> 39:45.150
My God, Jerry.

39:45.340 --> 39:49.190
What is your obsession with this man?

39:49.390 --> 39:51.440
What do you expect me to do, Annie,

39:51.640 --> 39:53.980
just lay back
and let him walk all over me?

39:54.180 --> 39:57.440
Let him walk all over our family?

39:57.640 --> 40:00.770
What I expect you to do

40:00.970 --> 40:03.270
is to think of me,

40:03.470 --> 40:04.850
at some point.

40:05.050 --> 40:06.270
Hmm.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.370
You don't think we can win.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.900
If you want to know how I'm paying for it,

40:16.090 --> 40:17.950
I took out a third mortgage on this house.

40:26.410 --> 40:28.410
(indistinct chatter)

40:29.700 --> 40:31.080
How you doing?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.450
JEREMIAH: Tell me, Willie,
how'd you wind up being a lawyer?

40:35.750 --> 40:37.250
Mm. (chuckles)

40:38.410 --> 40:39.980
Well, that depends.

40:40.180 --> 40:43.480
You want the, um, long or the short story?

40:43.680 --> 40:44.940
That's up to you.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.650
- (chuckles)
- Well,

40:46.840 --> 40:49.230
when I was a young husband,

40:49.430 --> 40:51.650
young father,

40:51.840 --> 40:53.440
me and my wife, we had,
you know, we had a little money,

40:53.640 --> 40:55.600
so we had a little landscaping business.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.480
Real nice, too.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.100
You know, kept-kept all the yards...

41:00.300 --> 41:01.850
fantastic.

41:02.050 --> 41:03.770
But then my wife was like,
"You know what?

41:03.970 --> 41:05.190
I want to move into a bigger place."

41:05.390 --> 41:06.850
I said, "Well, all right.
Let's do that, then."

41:07.050 --> 41:08.770
And so... (inhales)

41:08.970 --> 41:10.900
...got the paper, saw this ad.

41:11.090 --> 41:14.560
Three-bedroom apartment, man.
Real nice.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.850
Uh, nice new complex.

41:17.050 --> 41:20.190
Over there in a white neighborhood
at, uh, Raintree.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.310
So I said, "Yeah, that's what,
that's what we need."

41:22.510 --> 41:24.060
So I called the owner, I said, "Hey, man.

41:24.260 --> 41:27.520
"Me and my family are looking
for a new place.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.230
We want to come to where you are."

41:29.430 --> 41:31.310
I said, "Do you have any vacancies?"

41:31.510 --> 41:34.100
And he says, "Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got plenty of vacancies, you know?

41:34.300 --> 41:37.150
"Matter of fact, uh, at the end
of the month, you can move in.

41:37.340 --> 41:38.310
Get your lease."

41:38.510 --> 41:40.150
We all looking forward to that day, man.

41:40.340 --> 41:41.480
I mean, we just excited.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.560
You know, just brand-new beginnings,
if you would.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.190
So when the day comes,

41:45.390 --> 41:46.600
I pack everybody in the car.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.060
I got the-the-the, the boys in there,

41:49.260 --> 41:51.810
I got my-my wife,
I even got my dog in there, man.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.310
And we just happy, man. We happy.

41:54.510 --> 41:56.520
Uh, and we listening to gospel music.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.480
You know, singing, rocking and rolling.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.020
(sighs)

42:00.220 --> 42:01.850
But, um...

42:02.050 --> 42:05.020
when we get there, guy comes out.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.020
I said, "How you doing?" He barely speaks.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.520
He says, "What do you need?"

42:08.720 --> 42:10.150
I said, "I'm the one that, uh,
called you about the vacancies."

42:10.340 --> 42:11.940
He said, "What vacancies?"

42:12.140 --> 42:15.980
I said, "I'm Willie Gary.
I called you about the... the vacancies."

42:16.180 --> 42:17.770
He says, "Oh.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.750
We don't have no more vacancies."

42:23.160 --> 42:24.660
What'd you do?

42:25.910 --> 42:27.450
Tell you what I wanted to do.

42:28.830 --> 42:30.500
Wanted to hurt him.

42:31.500 --> 42:32.980
I mean...

42:33.180 --> 42:35.790
disrespecting me like that
in front of my boys, man.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.810
My boys look up to me.

42:39.010 --> 42:40.230
I'm their everything.

42:40.430 --> 42:41.650
What-what do I tell 'em?

42:41.840 --> 42:43.100
That...

42:43.300 --> 42:45.660
they daddy ain't good enough
to be in an apartment?

42:46.750 --> 42:48.870
What I tell my queen?

42:49.910 --> 42:51.500
That we not good enough?

42:56.660 --> 42:59.440
But I didn't act out.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.480
What I did was,

43:01.680 --> 43:03.310
I went back to that hotel,

43:03.510 --> 43:05.520
and I opened up the phone book.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.810
Now, I hadn't even thought about
being a lawyer until this happened.

43:09.010 --> 43:10.400
I opened it up and I...

43:10.590 --> 43:13.160
First law school I saw,
I said, "Mm. I'm going right there."

43:14.250 --> 43:15.400
And I did it.

43:15.590 --> 43:17.190
I enrolled, worked hard,

43:17.390 --> 43:18.830
I graduated, I passed the bar.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.120
And I got my own practice.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.270
And the first thing I did was

43:25.470 --> 43:27.770
went down to Raintree Apartments

43:27.970 --> 43:32.850
and bitch-slapped him with a five-count
discriminatory practices lawsuit.

43:33.050 --> 43:35.270
(chuckles)

43:35.470 --> 43:38.060
Take that for your vacancies.

43:38.260 --> 43:40.330
You a fighter.

43:41.620 --> 43:42.980
Yeah.

43:43.180 --> 43:44.520
Oh, I'm a fighter.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.690
You are, too, Jerry.
You're a fighter, man.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.350
You know why I say you're a fighter?

43:48.550 --> 43:52.270
Going up against
this big Loewen Group, man--

43:52.470 --> 43:54.650
small business owner, man,
that's something, doc.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.440
That's why we connect.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.410
What made you want to do it?

43:59.500 --> 44:03.980
'Cause he tried to mess with the one thing
that means the most to me in life:

44:04.180 --> 44:05.690
being able to leave something behind
for my children

44:05.890 --> 44:08.160
and my grandchildren when I go.

44:10.450 --> 44:12.450
They have a legacy, Willie.

44:13.620 --> 44:16.120
And I do mean to pass it on to 'em.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.900
- Let's play some music.
- I like music, Willie.

44:23.090 --> 44:24.270
(laughs) Good.

44:24.470 --> 44:26.440
Steve, look, why don't you go up there
and turn on some music?

44:26.640 --> 44:29.060
Sure thing, boss.
Anything particular you want to hear?

44:29.260 --> 44:31.350
You know what my jam is, man.
Tony! Toni! Toné!

44:31.550 --> 44:33.350
- Wise choice, my brother.
- I like that. Like that.

44:33.550 --> 44:34.900
You know what's crazy about
Tony! Toni! Toné!?

44:35.090 --> 44:37.020
Ain't none of 'em named Tony. (laughs)

44:37.220 --> 44:38.850
- ("Feels Good" playing)
- WILLIE: Oh, there it is.

(soft music playing in background)

45:09.640 --> 45:10.980
- Hey, hey.
- RECEPTIONIST: Hi.

45:11.180 --> 45:12.350
Welcome to Hotel Intercontinental.

45:12.550 --> 45:15.230
Well, thank you. I have a reservation
for Gary, Willie Gary.

45:15.430 --> 45:16.810
Absolutely.

45:17.010 --> 45:18.520
- And welcome to Jackson, Mr. Gary.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.310
If you have a credit card
you'd like me to run,

45:20.510 --> 45:22.190
I can go ahead and get you all settled in.

45:22.390 --> 45:23.520
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.310
Hey, hey, so don't look now, but that's,
over there, that's Loewen's legal team.

45:26.510 --> 45:28.560
Where-where's that? Hmm.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.600
(indistinct conversation)

45:31.800 --> 45:33.770
HAL:
Jesus Christ.

45:33.970 --> 45:36.810
It's like a who's who of every prominent
Black lawyer in the country.

45:37.010 --> 45:38.520
You actually recognize all of them?

45:38.720 --> 45:41.190
HAL: Okay, so, that guy over there,
that's Howard Pfieffer.

45:41.390 --> 45:43.440
- Mm.
- He's a former state representative

45:43.640 --> 45:46.150
- and current president
of the DC bar association. -Mm.

45:46.340 --> 45:48.480
That gentleman there,
that's Richard Mayfield.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.650
He's one of the leading experts
on antitrust

45:50.840 --> 45:52.770
and complex business litigation.

45:52.970 --> 45:55.770
And that gentleman, right over there,
that-that's Walter Bell.

45:55.970 --> 45:58.060
He's a former
Supreme Court Justice of Mississippi.

45:58.260 --> 45:59.440
Fuck.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.600
Man, Loewen must have spent
a fortune on these dudes.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.020
You know what? She don't actually look
as bad as I thought she was gonna look.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.560
What's her name?
Uh, uh, Mammy, May, Mame?

46:06.760 --> 46:07.850
Mammy, Mammy Downes?

46:08.050 --> 46:09.810
- Seriously? Is that all you have to say?
- Yeah.

46:10.010 --> 46:12.500
That's all I got to say
'cause they all look like chumps to me.

46:13.370 --> 46:15.020
Matter of fact, could you do me a favor?

46:15.220 --> 46:18.690
Could you send your finest bottle of, uh,
champagne over there to that table?

46:18.890 --> 46:20.480
Certainly. Do you have a preference?

46:20.680 --> 46:22.810
- What you got?
- We have Dom, Moët,

46:23.010 --> 46:24.060
- Cristal...
- Cristal.

46:24.260 --> 46:25.190
- Cristal.
- That's what we need.

46:25.390 --> 46:26.310
Send some Cristal over there.

46:26.510 --> 46:29.230
Make sure that you say that it's, uh,
compliments of Mr. Willie Gary.

46:29.430 --> 46:30.980
Hey. Seriously, man?

46:31.180 --> 46:33.020
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, seriously, Hal.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.520
- Shut up.

46:34.720 --> 46:37.600
Listen, I always say this:

46:37.800 --> 46:39.810
You see me fighting a bear?
Pour honey on me.

46:40.010 --> 46:42.600
We're just gonna pour a little honey.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.190
(horn honking in distance)

46:44.390 --> 46:46.100
WENDELL:
<i>Well, we keep the strategy simple.</i>

46:46.300 --> 46:48.400
<i>Firmly cementing</i>
<i>the validity of the document</i>

46:48.590 --> 46:50.560
as a contract in the jury's mind.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.770
That's definitely gonna be
the defense strategy, too.

46:52.970 --> 46:55.270
Except they'll be focused on proving
how it's not a contract.

46:55.470 --> 46:56.770
Okay, look,
we got to be honest about this.

46:56.970 --> 46:58.980
They're likely gonna be
a lot better at this than we are,

46:59.180 --> 47:01.520
considering this is
their area of expertise.

47:01.720 --> 47:05.190
REGGIE: I-I say we just forget
about all that contract mumbo jumbo.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.810
Bog the jury down
with a whole bunch of information

47:08.010 --> 47:08.940
that we know they ain't interested in.

47:09.140 --> 47:10.980
CHRIS:
Personally, what I think we gotta do--

47:11.180 --> 47:12.730
what we gotta prove, rather--

47:12.930 --> 47:14.150
is motive.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.190
We center our argument
squarely on the issue

47:16.390 --> 47:18.690
of Loewen Group stalling on closing.

47:18.890 --> 47:20.310
And show what they had to gain from it.

47:20.510 --> 47:22.940
- Uh, I'm not so sure.
- What? What, Hal?

47:23.140 --> 47:24.440
- What-what you ain't sure about?
- DASHAAN: What? Hal?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.150
HAL: What I mean is,
I'm not so sure we can actually prove

47:26.340 --> 47:28.350
that the Loewen Group had motive.

47:28.550 --> 47:30.600
Right? Unless we have
some kind of internal company memo.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.980
Or someone just openly admits it.

47:33.180 --> 47:34.940
Like, how do you actually prove

47:35.140 --> 47:36.770
that the stalling was intentional?

47:36.970 --> 47:39.950
Well, we're obviously never
going to be able to prove that.

47:42.450 --> 47:45.730
Truth is, we don't have a snowball's
chance in hell of winning this case.

55:38.390 --> 55:39.850
hinged on this deal.

Stall him out.

55:49.750 --> 55:51.250
Stall him out.

55:52.750 --> 55:53.810
It wasn't personal.

55:54.010 --> 55:55.560

<i>In fact, there is such a thing</i>

56:10.970 --> 56:14.520
uh, as an anticipatory breach of contract.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.270
And this is when,

56:16.470 --> 56:19.980
though the actual breach
has not yet occurred,

56:20.180 --> 56:22.270
one of the involved parties,

56:22.470 --> 56:27.190
heretofore referred to
as the "soon to be breaching party,"

56:37.180 --> 56:40.400
- it is my opinion that...
- (sighs)

56:40.590 --> 56:44.980
...it is well within the means of dispute

56:45.180 --> 56:46.810
for this contract.

56:47.010 --> 56:47.900
- Wake your ass up!

We sit up in these books,

56:52.010 --> 56:53.900

56:54.090 --> 56:55.230
For what?

56:55.430 --> 56:57.770

I'm putting him on.

57:16.010 --> 57:17.850
We got to shake it up.
And plus, he's a great witness.

You said it yourself. He's a good witness,
he's honest, he's-he's-he's,

57:24.340 --> 57:25.560
To civil-civil rights.

57:25.760 --> 57:27.100
Everything he did for Black folk?

57:27.300 --> 57:28.520
We put him in front of that jury,
he gonna play 'em.

57:33.050 --> 57:34.310
It ain't never too soon with me, Mike.

centered on character.
Would you agree?

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.370
Yes. I-I agree.

while you are a man of honor,

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:20.600

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.000
according to you, my client is not.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.600
I think Mr. Loewen and I have
very different approaches to--

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.730

Something I'm curious about...

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.440
How did you end up needing to sell
those funeral homes to Mr. Loewen?

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.190
Well, I had run into a little bit
of financial trouble.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.580
What kind of financial trouble?

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.350
Huh?

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.190
Because I'm, uh, pretty sure

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:59.690
the actual reason you so desperately
needed to sell at the time that you did

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.810
is because the Mississippi
state insurance commission

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:04.730
was about to revoke your license.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:05.940
Is that correct?

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.150
As a matter of fact, your license

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.190
to sell insurance
in the state of Mississippi

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.690
is currently under suspension.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.400
Can we agree that
that is a true statement,

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.060
- Mr. O'Keefe?
- JEREMIAH: No, we cannot.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.850
Because it's a lot more
complicated than that.

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:21.690
Enlighten me.
How is it more complicated?

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.650

I put Jerry on the stand
and I-I didn't have him prepared enough,

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.540

did the cross-examination, they, uh...

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.120
I worked at a Loewen-owned funeral home
for 13 years.

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:44.060
(quietly):
Just... in all that time,

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.650
I saw a lot, you know,

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.020
about how that company operates.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.480
Before we go any further,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.150
I just have to ask you:

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.750
would you be willing to testify?

Mrs. McGrath, hi.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.230
How you doing this afternoon?

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:12.770
Um, very well, thank you.

MIKE:
That's fine. That's just fine.

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.690
Mrs. McGrath, would you mind telling us

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.400
how long you worked as an employee

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:22.520
for the Durbin and Sons Funeral Home
in Southaven, Mississippi?

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.560
LORRAINE:
Um, I worked at that funeral home

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.940
for about 13 years before I quit.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.350
MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.440
And did you witness any transfer
of ownership during this time period?

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.810
LORRAINE:
Um...

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.480
(clears throat)

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.310
Uh, uh, Durbin and Sons was bought
by the Loewen Group

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:42.020
sometime around 1990.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.250
And I was there during that time.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.730
And did you notice any changes

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.650
in the way the company was run

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.400
after the Loewen Group took over?

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:55.020
Uh, the most significant was, uh,

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.650
how they implemented this,

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.900
this policy of-of raising prices
on certain items

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:04.580
in areas where they, uh,
didn't have any, any competition.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.980
Mostly, this turned out to be, um,

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:14.100
poor areas,
where there was a lot of-of poverty.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.040
Could you give us an example
of this type of selective pricing?

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:23.310
There was this one, uh,
casket in particular I remember.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.350
The, um, the Wilbert Copper Trubune.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:31.810
It, uh, was supposed to retail for $750.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:35.060
Uh, which it did in-in some places,

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.980
like, say, Madison.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:40.730
Uh, but then in other places,
like Corinth,

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.480
which, as you know, is-is very poor...

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.770
Yes, of course.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:48.350
Over there, they hiked the price up
to something crazy.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:51.540
Like three times
what it was supposed to cost.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.750
Just because they could.

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.440
They knew customers didn't have
anywhere else to go.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.440
So, basically,

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.440
if I understand you,

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.060
the Loewen Group was involved in
a form of selective price gouging.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.520
Of what?

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.480
Objection. Your Honor,
how could the witness possibly know

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.770
the intentions of people
she's never even met before?

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.230
Sustained.

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:16.560
All right, then.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.230
Let me ask you this.

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:21.440
In your time at Durbin and Sons,
were you ever left

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.980
with the impression that the Loewen Group

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.690
might have been specifically targeting

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.100
- minority communities...
- MAME: Objection.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.730
- Your Honor.
- Wow! Really?

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.900
- My God.
- MAME: Speculation.

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:35.440
Mr. Allred, what is the basis
for this line of questioning?

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.480
Mr. Allred?

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.480
You know what?

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.980
I apologize.

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.690
No basis. It was just speculation, is all.

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:47.410
Please, consider it stricken.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:51.770
But Your Honor, I do take exception
to Ms. Downes' tone.

01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:53.940
- You've got to be kidding.
- My tone?

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.850
- GRAVES: Noted.
- Her tone.

01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:57.480
- MAME: Oh, yeah.
- MIKE: Thank you, Mrs. McGrath.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.060
No further questions.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.350

Calling him as a material witness to
the agreement between O'Keefe and Loewen.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.600
Which means I will have him on cross.

The National Baptist Convention?

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.690
What... What is that?

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:10.310
It's like, um, you know, like...

01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:11.900
an arm of the Black church.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:13.730
But a really big one.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:15.940
Probably the biggest, actually.

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.600

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.350

But yeah.

Yeah, how? How does that make any sense?

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.730
I don't know.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.980
MAME:
Your Honor.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.400
Seriously?

01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:02.600
Where are you going with this,
Mr. Douglas?

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.480
Your Honor, we-we recognize
how this might seem a little unusual.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.980
However, Mr. Allred was with Mr. O'Keefe,

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.020
as his attorney, the entire time
he was dealing with Loewen.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.500
And, uh, we feel like his-his testimony
will be essential.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.770
REGGIE:
Michael Allred.

01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:23.980
Oh, hell, we friends. I'm-a call you Mike.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:26.100
- You bet, Reggie.
- (chuckles)

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.150
So, Mike,

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.230
in your 30 years of practicing law,

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:33.980
specializing in contract law,

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.310
did it ever occur to you,
when you were drawing up the contract

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:40.520
between Mr. O'Keefe and Mr. Loewen,
that there could be

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.190
any kind of misunderstanding as to what
that document actually was?

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:45.650
MIKE:
No, sir.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.310
It was extremely clear to everyone
exactly what it was.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.850
It was a contract.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.060
Contract. It's a contract.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.650
Now, was there anything that suggested,
in the language,

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.350
that the, uh,
agreed-upon time for the deal to close

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.850
would be... open-ended?

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.870
How's it feel to be sitting in that chair?

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.080
- It's a little uncomfortable, yeah.
- MAME: Mm.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.910
Imagine, we haven't even
gotten started yet.

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:18.690
You've been Mr. O'Keefe's attorney
quite some time now, yes?

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:20.270
MIKE:
I have.

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:21.980
For 30 years-- nearly 30 years.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.190
MAME:
Mm.

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:25.370
And would you say you
and Mr. O'Keefe are good friends?

01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:28.020
- Sure. He's one of my closest friends.
- Hmm.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.230
Yeah, we share a lot in common.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.080
I admire him.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.900
Mr. Allred, would you say
this is a case about race?

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:42.060
- (quietly): Objection. Objection.
- Objection.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.330
Overruled.

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:46.100
Would I say this is a case about race?

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.730
No, I would not say
this is a case about race.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.190
(exhales)

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.950
Really?

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:58.730
Okay, well, the subject of race does seem
to keep coming up, doesn't it?

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:00.770
Almost exclusively from your side.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.440
Uh, for instance,
this whole heroic narrative

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.770
about, uh, Mr. O'Keefe supposedly
having some sort of civil rights record

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.900
and denying the KKK a permit...

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:15.020
Uh, explain to me what relevance that has
to a case about contracts.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.560
Uh, about Jerry's character.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.060
It's more about his integrity

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.520
- and his decency.
- MAME: 'Cause he does

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.600
such great things for Black people, huh?

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.560
- Object-Objection.
- REGGIE: Objection, Your Honor.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.810
- WILLIE: Stand up.
- Objection. I'm not standing up.

01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.940
- I said "objection."
- GRAVES: I will not allow

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.230
this line of questioning, Ms. Downes.

01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:28.310
- Sustained.
- REGGIE: I'm-I'm objecting.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.400
MAME: Another thing that has been
made quite clear in this case is

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:34.400
how important family, family legacy,

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:36.230
is to Mr. O'Keefe.

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:38.020
Is that something you share?

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.810
Family important to you as well?

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.560
Well, it's not just important to me,
it's everything to me.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.270
It's everything. Well, that's something
you and Mr. O'Keefe have in common.

01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:46.400
- Objection.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:48.020
- (arguing over each other)
- MAME: Because you're best friends, yeah?

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.020
GRAVES: Overruled.
The witness can answer the question,

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.350
but let's try and get to the point.

01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:53.650
Absolutely, it's something
that we share in common.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.810
I-Is this really what you want
to be asking me, Ms. Downes?

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:57.520
It is.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.730
Actually.

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:00.120
But thank you.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.520
You love your family.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.650
Yeah?

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.350
Your extended family,
your immediate family--

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:08.100
you love all of your family, yes?

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.400
Every member of my family.

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.540
MAME:
Yeah?

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:16.020
So, there-there's no one
that you secretly wish you could disown?

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.310
- MAME: Someone that you're maybe
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:18.730
- a little ashamed...
- It doesn't matter what he feels.

01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:19.980
- MIKE: Disown?
- She doesn't know what...

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.940
'Cause I know I have some family members
I would love to disown.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.480
- But you don't.
- REGGIE: I'm-a take care of this.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.560
- MIKE: No.
- No? You don't.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.770
No.

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:27.770
Say, for instance, your grandfather.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.810
- My grandfather.
- MAME: Yes.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.620
Your grandfather.

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:41.080
He was my grandfather.
What does that have to do with this case?

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.230
Remind me:

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:50.200
how long was your grandfather
a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.600
(gallery murmuring)

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.980
- Objection. Objection.
- Objection. Objection.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.100
- Objection.
- (gavel pounding)

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.600
- We gonna stop this right now.
- WILLIE: Your Honor, I am gonna continue

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.810
- to say "objection."
- This is wrong.

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:00.900
- Objection.
- (gavel pounding)

01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:02.440
Objection. Objection.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.520
- Did you bond with your grandfather
- (Willie continues)

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.350
about the KKK?

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:07.440
- Did you share some bond?
- What is the question?

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.310
- What is the question?
- Did you share some love

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.100
about the burning cross?

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.400
You go to any, uh, KKK rallies
with your grandfather,

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:15.690
- Mr. Allred?
- WILLIE: Now, you know

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:17.810
this is out of line,
it has nothing to do with this case.

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:19.020
Objection.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.190
- Overruled, Mr. Gary.
- How can you overrule that?

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:21.310
Answer the question, Mr. Allred.

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:23.270
With all due respect, Your Honor,
this has nothing to do with the case.

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:25.190
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:28.690
Are you asking me was I aware that my
grandfather was once a member of the KKK?

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.980
Mike, you don't have
to answer that question.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.350
Objection.

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.400
I heard you the first time, Mr. Gary.

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:35.940
Yes, I was asking that question.

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.230
I am no longer asking that question.

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:38.900
- No further questions.
- (gavel pounds)

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:41.440
- WILLIE: What his grandfather has done...
- MIKE: You know, lawyer to lawyer,

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.230
that was completely out of line,
Ms. Downes.

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.900
Oh, the hypocrisy.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:46.400
The hypocrisy.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:49.230
- It's quite outrageous, Your Honor.
- (whispering)

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:52.230
REGGIE:
Room full of brothers right now.

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:53.690
- Denounce your granddaddy.
- CHRIS: Yeah.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:56.150
Say it, Mike. Say it.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.100
Go on. It's easy.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.600
- Come on, Mike. Denounce him.
- Yeah.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.020
You know what?

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.310
I'm sorry.

01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:03.690
All right?

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.060
I'm sorry.

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.520
Her behavior was unconscionable.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.230
You cannot hold someone responsible

01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.310
for the mistakes of their ancestors.

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:14.020
Mike, your granddaddy is a racist,

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.600
land-stealing, slave-raping

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.230
- piece of shit. -Oh, come on now,
Reggie Douglas, that's not right!

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:20.730
That's not right.
He's still my granddaddy.

01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:21.810
- I wouldn't say that about...
- Don't you bring...

01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:23.190
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Don't you bring up on me!

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:24.690
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Stop all this.

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:26.660
Stop it right now. Stop it.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.520
Reg, you stop. All of y'all.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.600
Mike, we not fixin' to crucify you...

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.560
about what happened in the past.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.900
He can't fix his grandfather
or anything else.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:39.850
But you know what we can fix?

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:41.150
This case.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.560
REGGIE:
Hold on.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.730
Hold on, man.

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:45.980
So you-you fixin' to give him a pass?

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.350
- That was this is?
- I'm-a give him a pass

01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.980
because you didn't know enough
about his past

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.700
and that's why you got your ass kicked.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.230
- Fuck this case, man.
- I think we can win.

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.730
No, man, I'm going back to Florida. Nah.

01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:58.150
- Doing exactly what we should've did
in the beginning. -Come on, man.

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.310
WILLIE:
I got a question for you, Reggie:

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:02.400
What's taking you so long
to get out the door?

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:03.730
REGGIE:
Wow.

01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:05.190
- Willie...
- You don't have to tell me twice.

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:06.830
Have fun with these white folks.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:08.980
- Reg.
- Hey, Reggie.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.290
Reg!

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.730
You want to go, too?

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:15.100
You know what?

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.230
I'm out.

01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:18.440
I'm tired of this shit.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.730
AL:
I'm out, too.

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:21.480
I miss home, anyway.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.040
Willie, I'm gettin' too old
for this shit, man.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.190
Mike, I'm sorry.

01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:29.560
I'm truly, truly sorry.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.790
Me, too.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.730
MIKE:
Can't have this.

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:37.230
Have what?

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:38.750
We got a case.

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:41.040
To win.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.160
I should probably...

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.020
- I should probably recuse myself.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.520
- Mike, no, you can't do that.
- Yeah, I probably should.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.980
- No, Mike, you can't do that.
- I should, shouldn't I?

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.350
Now, we got a long way to go,
but we can win this case.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:00.770
MIKE: If I even dare to step foot
in that courtroom again,

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:02.400
the jury's never gonna see me,

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:04.020
they're just gonna see
a guy with a sheet on his head.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.270
Listen, listen. We dug a hole.

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.520
We dug a hole, but we can dig out of it.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.600
I'm sorry, Willie, I can't do it,
'cause we both know if I stay on,

01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:04.060
It's like taking one history

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.580
and putting it right on top of another.

01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:10.770
It's like taking one man's legacy,

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:13.270
putting it on top of another.

01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:18.560
Till, one day, it gets pushed down so deep

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.540
buried so deep...

01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:25.660
...can't no one ever find it no more.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.730
WOMAN:
<i>Some of the members came to me</i>

01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:39.520
<i>and told me that</i>

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.650
the actual cost of burying my father

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.400
was gonna be much more than
what they said when I bought the policy.

01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:50.100
When I told them
that I didn't have the extra money,

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.440
and I didn't know how long
it would take me to get it,

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.980
they happily said
they'd keep the body on ice.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.900
Rather than give me any comfort,

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:02.690
the deacon assigned to be counselor

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:06.730
used it as an opportunity to shove
a bunch of brochures in my face

01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:09.440
and try and recruit me
as a Loewen sales rep.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.600
Then, suddenly,
this man from the NBC shows up,

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.690
asking if I've made
funeral arrangements and...

01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:17.500
if I'd be interested
in a Loewen burial package.

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:22.650
He said I'd get a much better deal
if I paid upfront.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.600
Before my son died.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.440
Once my husband finally passed,

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.520
that's when they said
that the package that I bought

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.650
didn't cover the cost of embalming
or moving the body.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.350
The coffin I bought for my mom

01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:38.580
was the least expensive one.

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:42.060
Come to find out

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.080
the one they sold me was
three times more than average.

01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:50.480
Your own preacher come to you,
telling you you need something,

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.120
and you religious, you believe it.

01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:57.440
WILLIE:
Now, I understand that you are

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.850
one of the analysts for the Loewen Group.

01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:01.940
You deal with
some of the high-level deals.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:03.650
Is that correct?

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.150
- Yes, that's correct.
- WILLIE: Mm-hmm.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.600
Also that you were, uh,

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.310
one of the architects of this latest deal

01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:11.270
that you had between the Loewen Group

01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:13.190
and the National Baptist Convention.

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:15.190
- Is that right?
- Yes, I was.

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:17.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Baptist?

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.900
- No, not Baptist.
- No.

01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:20.190
- Christian, though, right?
- Yes.

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:21.730
Yeah, yeah. We all Christian, right?

01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:23.190
We all believe in God. Amen?

01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:24.560
Amen.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.190
(Willie exhales)

01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:28.150
Here's the question, though.

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:32.100
How much money did the Loewen Group

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.980
project to make from this deal

01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:38.650
of them and the NBC?

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.230
And remember...

01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:43.080
you're under oath.

01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:49.480
Uh, our original long-term projections
for that deal were somewhere around

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.100
1... maybe $1.2 billion.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.600
$1.2 million?

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.270
- $1.2 billion.
- $1.2...

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:58.160
$1.2 billion?

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.440
$1.2 billion, that's-that's good money.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.650
That's good money
for the Loewen Group, correct?

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.980
- Yes.
- That's good money.

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.810
That's good money. $1.2 billion.

01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:11.100
I thought you said "million,"
but you said "billion dollars."

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.190
Uh...

01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:15.160
How much did you pay 'em?

01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.950
I'm sorry?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.480
I said, how much did you pay 'em?

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.310
How much did the Loewen Group

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.600
pay the National Baptist Convention

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.330
as compensation as a result of the deal?

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:36.200
I believe we made
about a $200,000 donation.

01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:41.850
The jury heard it.

01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:44.150
We didn't have a defense for it.

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:46.870
Oh, what a fucking mess.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.540
I'm gonna have to call Loewen.

<i>Dealing with people honestly</i>

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.940
Do we seek to be tough competitors

in an increasingly volatile market?

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.810
Yes.

Mr. Loewen, how you doing?

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.730
- I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Gary.
- You look good in that suit, doc.

That's that Armani, I can tell that

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.150
- a mile away.
- (chuckles)

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.020
Listen, I just want to thank you
for coming down here.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.980
I know you're really busy,

01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.900
and we appreciate it,
but it's good to have the big man here.

01:37:57.090 --> 01:38:01.350
Because, um, you know, we want to shine
some light on some of these dark places.

01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:03.100
And, uh,
I'll just start right off with it.

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.900
I want to know, from your perspective...

01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:07.310
(clears throat)

01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:10.440
...what was the deal that you had
between you and Mr. O'Keefe?

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.350
I believe it was roughly a year ago

01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:17.900
when we received an enquiry

01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:21.310
from a representative of Mr. O'Keefe's.

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:23.810
In fact,

01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:28.190
I'm pretty sure it was his lawyer,
Mr. Allred, who contacted us.

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:30.600
My understanding is

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.100
they were very anxious to sell.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:36.230
So we started looking into the deal.

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:37.940
Sussing it out.

01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:41.850
Trying to determine if it was something

01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:44.810
that would be a good fit for our business.

01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:49.100
Sometime after that,
I invited Mr. O'Keefe and his associates

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.810
up to Vancouver.

01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:54.100
If I recall, they came for dinner,

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.040
at my boat, and we discussed things.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.730
After that, uh, hard to say.

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:05.700
Normally, at that stage, I turn things
over to my acquisitions team.

01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:09.060
Well, that's pleasant.

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.900
I mean, that really is.

01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:12.310
And... (clears throat)

01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:13.650
...lucky for you,

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.190
uh, Mr. Loewen, I don't have
a lot of follow-up questions.

01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:20.830
I just have, uh, one thing
I want to ask you. Uh...

01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:23.730
What kind of boat?

01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:25.730
Come again?

01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:27.660
Oh, I said: "What kind of boat?"

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:31.190
You-you said earlier that you guys
were all on the boat together,

01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:32.690
and y'all was eating
and having a good time,

01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:34.440
having the best fish,

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.310
and I just wanted to know,
what kind of boat is it?

01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:37.810
I don't understand.

01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:40.500
Are you asking
about the particular make, or...

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.020
Matter of fact, I was asking...

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:48.350
Can I read from this?
It says, "Nine sunning decks."

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:50.690
Mm. "Six elegant staterooms."

01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:52.100
- Uh...
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.190
- What is the relevance...
- "Five luxury guest cabins."

01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:54.440
- ...of the witnesses' boat?
- Overruled.

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:55.520
Your Honor,
can I just read what the boat is?

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.980
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- It's a nice boat.

01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.810
- Overruled.
- I just want to recognize

01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:01.560
and let everybody see
that it's a very nice boat.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.400
You got, uh, helicopter, helicopter pad.

01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:05.560
You can land a helicopter

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.850
- on that thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:07.980
That's something else right there.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.310
That's high grass.

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:12.540
How much did, uh,
how much did this boat of yours cost?

01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:16.400
I really don't know.

01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:18.150
I think we're...

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:19.650
You're not understanding the question.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.440
I'm... Let me frame it again
so you can understand it better.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.270
I'm asking you

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:26.400
how much did you pay

01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:28.580
for your boat?

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:30.900
I don't know.

01:40:31.090 --> 01:40:31.980
- MAME: Objection. -RAY: I don't know.
- Can I ask...

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.850
- MAME: Asked and answered.
- You know what? Forget about that.

01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:35.020
Let me ask you this:

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.310
How much you pay for your plane? Huh?

01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:39.350
Since you can remember some things
and you forget other things,

01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:40.600
how much you pay for your plane?

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.100
How much did you pay
for your plane, Mr. Gary?

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.400
I saw it on the runway.

01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:45.520
Oh. You know what?

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.190
We could talk about how much
I paid for my plane,

01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:48.810
'cause I know exactly how much it was,

01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:50.310
but we not talking
about my plane right now.

01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:51.980
We talking about your boat.

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.190
So, let me ask one more time,

01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:56.270
so everybody can hear
and understand what I'm saying

01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:58.440
to Mr. Loewen, the billionaire

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.850
who doesn't know the price of his own boat

01:41:01.050 --> 01:41:03.020
that he had dinner on with his colleagues.

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:06.480
I want to ask you again:
how much did you pay

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.000
for your boat?

01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:11.080
I don't know.

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.770
I think he's not hearing what I'm saying.

01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:16.270
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
Mr. Loewen.

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:18.000
How much did your boat cost?

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.190
What is your point?

01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:22.440
What's my point?

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.560
What is my point?

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.480
While you were sitting there sunning
on that $25 million boat,

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:31.150
eating your $30 a head lobster,

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.440
did it ever bother you
that it was all being paid for

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.690
by all the poor people
and destitute people

01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:39.150
that your company was
systematically taking advantage of

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:40.980
and profiting from every single day?

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.730
- MAME: Objection! Counsel is testifying.
- Huh? Not only that,

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.600
they were taking advantage of 'em
at their worst time,

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.230
when they're downtrodden,
when they lost somebody,

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:49.900
when they're mourning somebody.

01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:51.650
And now, who has to pay for it?

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.400
The small businessman
like Jeremiah O'Keefe.

01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:56.270
The small businessman in this country,

01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:58.560
who worked so hard to pay for everything

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.190
and stay on top and keep afloat

01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:02.980
while these greedy corporations

01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.940
do everything they can and...

01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:06.230
Objection, Your Honor!

01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.440
I think I've had quite enough of this.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.520
Sit your ass down!

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.230
- (gavel pounding)
- You sit your ass down

01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:13.580
until I finish what I'm saying,
because I'm not done.

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.400
- I'm not done with my question
by a long shot. -Mr. Gary!

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:20.410
Language of that nature
will not be tolerated in my court.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:25.060
Mr. Loewen, you may not leave
the witness stand

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:27.270
unless you're excused by me.

01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:29.200
Do you understand?

01:42:41.290 --> 01:42:42.810
You may continue, Mr. Gary,

01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:45.080
but I warn you to tread lightly.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.540
I just want to know one thing.

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.540
Did it ever bother you at all?

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.000
No.

01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:25.910
(gallery murmuring quietly)

01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:30.440
- (lightly slaps stand)
- That's all I need.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.830
(murmuring increases)

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.160
You're dismissed.

01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:48.440
RAY:
Motherfucker!

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.270
Motherfucker!

01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:53.020
What was that? What was that?!

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:55.160
I was skewered out there!

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:06.020
Well, Sister Souljah, what you got for me?

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:08.690
Well, came to let you know
we've come to a decision.

01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:11.150
Mm. We have? And what have we decided?

01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:13.440
Well, in light of recent events,

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.020
it does feel that it would be best
for all parties involved...

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.370
- Oh.
- ...to reopen a settlement discussion.

01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:23.310
In other words, we are...

01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.560
we are prepared to make your client

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.190
- a very generous offer.
- (chuckling)

01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:32.060
I know that's hard for you to, uh,
get out, but how generous are we talking?

01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:34.440
I mean, work with me, Willie.
It's not gonna be $100 million.

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.850
Work with you? What are you talking about?

01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:37.400
I mean, needless to say,

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:39.810
- it's gonna be in the range
in which neither Jerry... -Uh-huh.

01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:41.310
...nor his kids
nor his grandkids would ever

01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:42.690
- have to worry about anything again.
- Okay.

01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:44.980
- That sound good. That sound good.
- Yes.

01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.980
I'll tell you what.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.200
Why don't we meet in your room
in a couple hours?

01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:53.370
And make sure you get
your best negotiator. You know why?

01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:57.120
Your ass gonna need it.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.400
NEGOTIATOR:
Generally, damages in tort are awarded

01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:04.600
simply to restore the plaintiff
back to the position

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.600
he or she was in before tort occurred.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.270
However, given how protracted
this whole matter has become,

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.560
we believe that it is
in all our best interests

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.560
just to resolve this once and for all.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.020
We'd like to make you what we consider

01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:19.900
a very generous offer.

01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:22.020
Obviously,
should you decide not to take it,

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.190
we can all go back into court tomorrow.

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:26.100
You can roll the dice with the jury.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:29.270
But, frankly, uh,
the chances that you will win

01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:31.690
or come anywhere close to this number,

01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:34.000
is a risk I doubt you want to take.

01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:46.310
Okay.

01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:47.910
Here's our offer.

01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:10.370
The answer's no.

01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:13.480
MAME:
Are you serious?

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.770
He's serious?

01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:16.350
JEREMIAH:
I said the answer's no.

01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:19.730
RAY: You mean to tell me you are
really going to turn that down?

01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:22.850
You sure you don't maybe want
a little more time to think it over?

01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:25.600
- JEREMIAH: I've thought it over enough.
- RAY: Have you?

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.980
I think we both know that's more money
than you'll ever see in your lifetime.

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:31.440
We gonna get down to business
or y'all gonna keep wasting our time?

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.690
- (Ray sighs)
- The man said no.

01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:34.770
Hmm?

01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:36.600
(Ray clears throat)

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.540
- (whispering)
- Mm. Okay.

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:42.620
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:45.910
(pen scratching)

01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:56.620
- MAME: Best and final.
- WILLIE: Mm-hmm.

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.790
(soft grunt)

01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:32.230
Answer's still no.

01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:33.520
(coughs)

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.190
Well, this is just fucking unbelievable.

01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:38.310
What the hell's your problem, O'Keefe?

01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:40.980
You can't honestly tell me
that is not enough.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.520
It's more than enough for me.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.060
It's just not enough for you.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:45.650
For me?

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.440
As in enough to put you out of business.

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.940
Ah. (scoffs)

01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.560
Come on.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.400
Let me tell you something, pal.

01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:55.810
The amount of money it would take
to put me out of business--

01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:58.650
the real, actual amount--

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.810
is a number you can't even calculate.

01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:02.560
Take the money, Jerry.

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.270
You're 80 years old.

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:06.600
- Seventy-five.
- Can you please talk to your client?

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:07.940
WILLIE:
Talk to him about what?

01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.600
- About the fact he just turned down...
- Oh, he said no.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.310
Last I checked, "no" means "no," right?

01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:13.150
RAY:
What does it feel like

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:16.850
to be some small-time, nobody
funeral director

01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:18.850
on the verge of bankruptcy

01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:22.480
who just passed on
his one and only chance

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.440
at $75 million?

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.480
- What's it feel like?
- RAY: Mm.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.410

01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:44.040
Done a lot of big cases, but...

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:47.660
...this particular one is...

01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:54.000
Lot of people's lives in my hand. And...

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.120
I think I kind of feel that
a little bit, you know.

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.350
Especially...

01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:04.200
especially when it comes to Jerry.

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.160
(sighs)

01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:10.330
So...

01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:13.940
I don't want to lose.

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.020
I mean, I don't...

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:17.910
I-I think...

01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:21.230
...what if I don't win

01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:23.040
and...

01:50:24.450 --> 01:50:26.540
...I let all these people down?

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.650
Well...

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.750
you're not going to let them down.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.830
So you don't need to worry.

01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:41.850
(sighs)

01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:45.310
You know that for a fact, Miss Gloria?

01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:47.310
I don't know it for a fact.

01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:49.330
- I know you for a fact.
- Mm.

01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:57.410
I know the man I married.

01:50:58.910 --> 01:51:00.290
Yeah, baby.

(gasps) Oh, but...

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:08.100
One suggestion, though, baby?

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.370
Yeah? What's that?

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.850
When you're up there in court tomorrow,

01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:16.750
- doing your thing...
- Doing my thing.

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.940
...just...

01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:25.330
try not to refer to yourself
in the third person.

01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:29.330
Okay.

01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:34.230
- (laughs)
- What, um... (clears throat)

01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:35.480
What you, what you talking about, Gloria?

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.520
(smacks lips) I don't, I don't do that.

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.400
- Yeah, you do.
- Go on.

01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:40.980
- Nah, I...
- Just a little.

01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:44.160
I don't think I do that.

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:46.230
I don't.

01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:49.230

Willie Gary coming upstairs now!"

01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:52.060

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.600
You do.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:58.400

every once in a while.

...I just have one small question to ask.

01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:43.660
Do y'all mind if I keep things simple?
Hmm?

01:52:44.370 --> 01:52:46.370
