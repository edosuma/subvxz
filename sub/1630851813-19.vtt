10:34.459 --> 10:35.852
I have a few
questions of my own.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.767
Here's one.
Why'd you fake Miles' death

10:37.811 --> 10:39.334
and then hook up with his wife?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.771
Wait, what?Yeah.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.077
It's that kind
of conversation.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.600
We know about
the trailer, too,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.297
by the way.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.212
You happen to know
who was shooting at us?

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
Oh, no. Uh...

10:51.738 --> 10:54.044
Miles-- did they get him?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.655
No, he's fine. He's fine.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.047
Not thanks to you,
I'm guessing.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.136
I'll tell you, man,

10:59.180 --> 11:00.485
there is a special kind of hell

11:00.529 --> 11:02.400
for the games
you've been playing.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.228
And a supermax for all
the laws you've broken.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.760

of a Texas Ranger.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.152
You're probably
gonna get a little more

11:15.196 --> 11:16.458

on the wrist.

I'm gonna ask you again.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.376
Who's trying to kill us?

11:22.464 --> 11:25.772
This is what Miles
and I were trying to avoid.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.252
I mean, I'm sure
they're tracking me,

11:28.296 --> 11:29.558

Ah, they'll keep coming.Who?

31:16.700 --> 31:18.659

connecting the dots

31:18.702 --> 31:20.052
to a powerful group.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.531

in the shadows.

it kind of is,

were real either.

Until one day I went to go
pick up Sachi from school.

31:31.411 --> 31:35.241

had come by earlier for her.

like we were being followed.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.728
And Fenton said
that they got to him

31:44.772 --> 31:48.123
and they threatened
to kill everyone...

so that's what we did.

31:51.387 --> 31:52.954

Took me out
so we would stop the threat.

could be the person

there's a chance

that I was alive.
