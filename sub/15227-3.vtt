01:17.843 --> 01:21.312
Nardo, you're not going
          to get a cop for this.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.115
I mean, the police have
               their priorities.

01:24.183 --> 01:28.152
Finding a missing cabbie
            lies somewhere below

01:28.220 --> 01:30.722
"There's a cat in heat
   disturbing the neighborhood."

01:31.957 --> 01:34.492
Yes, hello.
Yes, my name is Elaine Nardo

01:34.560 --> 01:36.661
and I'd like to report
a missing cab driver.

01:36.729 --> 01:39.397
His name is
Alex Reiger and...

01:39.465 --> 01:40.732
Yes, I'll hold.

01:40.799 --> 01:43.167
(meowing)

01:45.270 --> 01:46.504
Look, Nar-Nardo,

01:46.571 --> 01:49.607
I-I... I already sent
     Banta to his apartment

01:49.675 --> 01:52.309
to see if he's there
  and not answering the phone.

01:52.377 --> 01:53.311
You did?

01:53.379 --> 01:54.545
Yeah, don't worry.
Don't worry.

01:54.613 --> 01:57.015
Hello! Yes, yes, yes, um,
    his name is Alex Reiger.

01:57.082 --> 01:59.284
He's been missing
      for 15 hours, he...

01:59.352 --> 02:00.585
What do you mean,

02:00.653 --> 02:02.720
call back when he's been
       gone for 24 hours?

02:02.788 --> 02:04.556
What? Uh...

02:04.624 --> 02:06.491
Oh, do you believe that?!

02:06.559 --> 02:08.493
Nardo, I told you, they...
                      (groaning)

02:08.561 --> 02:10.328
What do we pay
      those guys for, huh?

02:10.395 --> 02:13.097
I mean, I've never called a
    policeman before in my life.
   Nah, no, no, no--

02:13.165 --> 02:14.166
The one time I do...
   N-N-Nardo!

02:14.233 --> 02:15.800
Now, you're
  getting hysterical

02:15.868 --> 02:17.602
and I don't want
to have to slap you.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.671
Oh, come on, what do you guys
      need to hear, huh?!
                        Nardo...

02:19.739 --> 02:21.606
That he's been shot?
 That he's been in an accident?
                   Nardo...

02:21.674 --> 02:23.308
That he's been mugged?
     That he's been raped?
   Nardo...

02:23.376 --> 02:24.308
That he's been murdered?

02:26.445 --> 02:30.148
You slap a hysterical person
        across the face.

02:32.718 --> 02:34.385
Like that.
Will you get out of here?!

02:35.487 --> 02:37.221
Oh, Tony!

02:37.289 --> 02:38.722
Tony, Tony, Tony,
was he there?

02:38.790 --> 02:40.058
No, I couldn't find him, Elaine.

02:40.126 --> 02:41.325
Well, look at me, not him.

02:41.393 --> 02:43.161
I can't.
I can't move my head.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.261
What's the matter
with your head?

02:44.329 --> 02:45.563
Well, when I got there, uh,

02:45.631 --> 02:47.699
Alex didn't answer,
   so I broke down his door.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.200
Then when I found
      the right apartment,

02:49.268 --> 02:50.501
I had to break down
        that door, too.

02:50.569 --> 02:53.505
You're lucky the elevator
        opens by itself.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.240
Tony, what should we do?

02:55.308 --> 02:56.908
Well, well,
     this is painful, guys.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.810
You think maybe you could stand
     one behind the other?

02:58.877 --> 03:00.745
Oh, sure.
            Oh, thanks.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.082
I think we should
                  call the cops.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.784
No, I already
called the cops.
  She already tried the cops.

03:05.851 --> 03:08.353
They're not going to come.
            Oh, I just saw a cop
              across the street.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.587
Oh!
             You saw a cop
          across the street?!

03:09.655 --> 03:10.588
Well, go get him.
Well, yeah!

03:10.656 --> 03:11.723
But don't tell him how long

03:11.791 --> 03:13.291
Reiger's been missing.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.392
Yeah, go over there, Tony.
Go on. Go on over there.
Go on, get him.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.393
My neck hurts.

03:17.930 --> 03:21.532
Louie... are <i>you</i> worried?

03:23.435 --> 03:25.737
Yeah.

03:25.804 --> 03:27.171
Oh, no.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.973
Oh, no, if you're worried...

03:29.040 --> 03:30.708
Alex must be...

03:30.775 --> 03:32.710
Dead.

03:34.213 --> 03:37.582
No, don't say it-- no.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.685
Nardo, it looks like Reiger's
     gone to the harp farm.

03:40.752 --> 03:43.921
(wailing):
                      No, Louie!

03:43.989 --> 03:47.225
I feel terrible.
I mean, I... (muttering)

03:47.293 --> 03:49.193
He's the only guy
in this garage

03:49.261 --> 03:51.262
that I could ever talk to.

03:51.330 --> 03:54.098
I... I'm so alone.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.134
I'll take care
                  of you, Louie.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.370
Oh, good, Nardo, good.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.571
Oh, good.

03:59.638 --> 04:01.740
Oh, take care
of me, Nardo.

04:01.807 --> 04:03.007
Oh, good.

04:03.075 --> 04:06.011
Oh...
             (crying, muttering)

04:06.078 --> 04:07.612
(Elaine continues crying)

04:07.680 --> 04:10.314
Yeah, yeah, Nardo.
Yeah, yeah...

04:10.382 --> 04:12.016
Take care of me, Nardo.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.451
Yeah, Nardo...
              Hi, guys.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.954
Oh, great, Reiger,
you're alive!

04:18.023 --> 04:19.390
LOUIE:
Thank God!

04:19.458 --> 04:21.858
Oh!
                  Hey, hey, hey,
                what's going on?

04:21.927 --> 04:23.862
(shushing)

04:26.765 --> 04:28.066
How come you didn't
call us, huh?

04:28.134 --> 04:29.434
I been worried
sick about you!
                         Huh?

04:29.502 --> 04:31.202
How the hell could
you do that to us?
                      I'm sorry.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.537
Listen, my radio
                 wasn't working.

04:32.604 --> 04:33.971
I'm sorry if I
                had you worried,

04:34.039 --> 04:36.541
but I had the most
      fantastic adventure.

04:36.608 --> 04:37.709
LOUIE:
What? What?

04:37.776 --> 04:39.877
I had to take this fare
               to Atlantic City.

04:39.945 --> 04:41.612
He tips me 200 bucks.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.714
200 bucks!

04:43.782 --> 04:45.316
And I know I swore off gambling,

04:45.383 --> 04:47.785
but there I was
 in Atlantic City with a 200...

04:47.853 --> 04:50.388
I mean, I had a found 200 bucks,
        if you know what

04:50.456 --> 04:51.856
I'm talking about.
             Alex.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.391
You know you have
     this gambling problem,

04:53.459 --> 04:55.126
so why didn't you just
      take the money home?

04:55.194 --> 04:57.028
Well, if I did, I wouldn't have
      been able to parlay

04:57.095 --> 04:59.798
that 200 bucks
       into 2,000 bucks.

04:59.865 --> 05:01.232
Two-two thousand?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.467
2,000 bucks!

05:02.534 --> 05:03.901
Every time I had the dice,

05:03.969 --> 05:05.903
I made pass after pass.
        I couldn't lose.

05:05.971 --> 05:07.404
Yeah?
Yeah, a crowd started to gather.

05:07.472 --> 05:08.540
They all started applauding me.

05:08.607 --> 05:10.341
(laughs)
       I mean, I had the feeling

05:10.409 --> 05:12.410
that I was absolutely
          invincible.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.645
You want to know
              the greatest thing
           about the experience?

05:14.713 --> 05:15.680
What? What?

05:15.747 --> 05:17.515
I left.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.685
That's right.
 For the first time in my life,

05:20.752 --> 05:22.252
I walked away a winner.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.888
You, uh...

05:23.956 --> 05:26.691
You mean that you started
          losing bets

05:26.759 --> 05:29.427
and you, uh, felt like
     you were cooling down,

05:29.495 --> 05:30.695
so you left?
          No! No, no.

05:30.763 --> 05:33.530
I made my last eight passes
    and I just walked away.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.000
You mean your nerves
started going

05:36.068 --> 05:38.002
and-and you felt
like you were choking?

05:38.070 --> 05:40.037
Nah, I never felt
              better in my life.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.507
You mean the casino
      shut down the table

05:43.575 --> 05:44.608
and forced you to leave?

05:44.676 --> 05:47.445
Louie, I walked away a winner!

05:47.513 --> 05:49.881
You mean you walked away
           from that

05:49.949 --> 05:51.783
while you were still hot?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.551
What are you made of,
   what're you made of stone?

05:53.619 --> 05:55.019
No!

05:55.087 --> 05:56.387
I got willpower.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.957
Aw, the itch might still
 be there, but I'm telling you,

05:59.024 --> 06:00.992
the feeling of walking away
        from a table hot

06:01.059 --> 06:02.861
is a lot better reward
      than sticking around

06:02.928 --> 06:06.231
and winning another two
 or three or five or ten or...

06:06.298 --> 06:09.600
20,000 bucks...

06:09.668 --> 06:11.436
Reiger...

06:11.503 --> 06:15.940
Reiger, I know a table
not five minutes away from here.

06:17.676 --> 06:19.410
(laughs):
        Nah, nah, nah...
Come on, Reiger.

06:19.478 --> 06:22.580
Think of how proud you'd be
  to walk away a second time.

06:23.715 --> 06:25.183
Come on, Reiger!
                            Nah.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.284
Seven come eleven.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.353
Huh? Baby needs
a new pair of shoes.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.453
Come on.

06:29.521 --> 06:31.121
Hey, little Joe, ho-ho!

06:31.189 --> 06:33.457
Come on, fever, fever.

06:33.525 --> 06:34.925
Come on, Reiger!
           Alex...

06:34.993 --> 06:36.461
Come on! Ho,ho!
         ..don't let him
         do this to you.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.795
Come on, you know you're
     a compulsive gambler.

06:37.863 --> 06:40.464
Elaine, would you please
          just stay out of this?

06:40.532 --> 06:41.966
Don't mother me.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.201
I won't.

06:48.106 --> 06:50.307
It's a good thing
you got rid of her.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.710
She's a bad influence.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.113
Now, the point is, Reiger,

06:55.181 --> 06:57.748
that I believe
in hot streaks.

06:57.816 --> 07:00.385
And if you're still hot,

07:00.453 --> 07:03.754
and I can get you
        to a crap table

07:03.822 --> 07:06.390
in the back
     of a fancy restaurant

07:06.458 --> 07:10.494
not five minutes away
          from here...

07:10.562 --> 07:14.031
we can make a lot of money.

07:14.099 --> 07:17.001
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
             if, if, if, if, if.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.870
(chuckles)
             If I was still hot.

07:18.937 --> 07:20.538
And if you could
                   get me to go.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.874
And if there
                 was a crap game

07:22.942 --> 07:25.810
in a restaurant not
       five minutes from here...

07:25.877 --> 07:27.511
There is.

07:27.579 --> 07:28.846
Are you still hot?

07:30.082 --> 07:31.649
Yep, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.117
Hey, I got the cop.

07:33.185 --> 07:34.618
Hiya, Tony.

07:34.686 --> 07:36.687
Hey, Officer, I think
that's the guy that was missing.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.155
It was.

07:38.223 --> 07:40.291
I guess I brought you down here
          for nothing.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.195
Sometimes I think
   they take advantage of me.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.901
(clamoring)

07:54.806 --> 07:56.874
Come on, hey, will you
      quit crowding here?

07:56.942 --> 07:59.544
You're already taking
                 up nine spaces.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.114
You know, Lou, I think
                 it's about time

08:03.181 --> 08:05.183
we upped the stakes
              just a little bit.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.285
Reiger, I'm matching
  you bet for bet.

08:09.587 --> 08:11.522
(Louie muttering)

08:11.590 --> 08:12.857
Seven! A winner!

08:12.925 --> 08:14.024
(all cheering)

08:16.628 --> 08:19.530
Come on! Come on!

08:19.598 --> 08:21.899
Pay up, pay up!
                Good, very good.

08:21.967 --> 08:25.503
Hey, this beats stealing
computer secrets, don't it?

08:26.838 --> 08:29.240
Eight, the number's eight.
The point is eight.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.775
Give me a $20 hard eight.

08:30.842 --> 08:32.275
The hard eight, yeah.

08:32.344 --> 08:35.380
The fat lady wants
                   a hard eight.

08:35.447 --> 08:36.881
All right.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.482
Uh, sorry about
                     that, lady.

08:38.549 --> 08:39.683
Don't apologize for him,

08:39.751 --> 08:42.885
just roll a hard eight,
big nose.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.889
(laughing)

08:44.957 --> 08:47.057
A hard eight
               for the fat lady.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.061
Eight, the hard way.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.863
(cheering)

08:51.931 --> 08:54.298
LOUIE: Eight the hard way!
    Reiger! Reiger! Reiger!

08:54.365 --> 08:59.404
Reiger, I'm not ashamed to say
          I love you.

08:59.471 --> 09:02.039
STICKMAN: Come on, bets.
Come on, bets.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.976
All right, I believe there's
      another 11 in here.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.377
I believe there's
        another 11 here.

09:06.445 --> 09:07.411
What do you think, Lou?

09:07.479 --> 09:09.413
Reiger...

09:10.549 --> 09:12.116
I believe.

09:13.218 --> 09:14.551
Eleven.
                     Eleven!

09:14.619 --> 09:16.820
Eleven! Eleven! Eleven!

09:16.888 --> 09:19.824
Eleven! Eleven!
         (laughs)

09:19.892 --> 09:21.058
Do you all believe?

09:21.126 --> 09:22.459
ALL:
          We believe!

09:22.527 --> 09:23.861
Watch this.
                What's your bet?

09:23.929 --> 09:25.996
Okay.

09:26.064 --> 09:28.032
STICKMAN: Snake eyes.
Craps, a loser!

09:28.099 --> 09:29.299
Hey, don't worry!
             Don't worry, folks.

09:29.367 --> 09:30.535
A momentary setback.

09:30.602 --> 09:32.169
Nothing to worry about.
     All right, all right.

09:32.237 --> 09:33.270
Do you still believe?

09:33.338 --> 09:34.905
(all shouting)

09:34.973 --> 09:36.908
(all cheering)

09:36.976 --> 09:39.443
Twelve! Boxcars!
        Craps, a loser.

09:39.511 --> 09:41.278
(crowd groaning)
    Hey, don't give up now.

09:41.346 --> 09:42.946
Don't give up now.
            I'm hot!

09:43.014 --> 09:44.949
Reiger, Reiger,
  Reiger, Reiger...

09:47.586 --> 09:49.621
(whispers):
 I think your streak
   is over, Reiger.

09:49.688 --> 09:50.922
Oh, yeah?

09:50.989 --> 09:52.456
Yeah.

09:52.524 --> 09:55.926
That's what separates the men
        from the mutants, Louie.

09:57.296 --> 09:59.363
I'm going to bet
                  all I got left
   No, no, no.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.164
on the pass line.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.367
Reiger, Reiger, Reiger,
Reiger, that's a fortune there.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.369
Yeah? You in?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.440
Not me.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.774
But I'm rooting for you.

10:12.777 --> 10:14.611
Read 'em and weep.

10:14.679 --> 10:16.780
Nine, the point is nine.

10:16.848 --> 10:19.117
Got it. We got it.
                      We got it.

10:20.051 --> 10:21.385
Okay, come on,
come on.

10:21.452 --> 10:22.653
Come on, nine.
Nine.

10:22.721 --> 10:24.255
Come on, nine.
 Nine.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.223
Come on... nine.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.559
STICKMAN:
Seven, a loser.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.793
(crowd groaning)

10:29.861 --> 10:31.128
New shooter
coming out.

10:31.196 --> 10:34.031
Get your bets down.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.070
STICKMAN: New shooter.
Get your bets down.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.275
Four, the point is four.

10:44.342 --> 10:47.111
Bet it the hard way.

10:53.151 --> 10:57.087
Uh, Reiger, I...

10:57.155 --> 10:59.824
I really feel bad
      for you.

11:03.528 --> 11:06.029
I, uh...

11:06.097 --> 11:08.666
I'd like to stay here
and comfort you.

11:08.733 --> 11:11.102
But I'd rather go home

11:11.170 --> 11:13.337
and lay all this
money on my bed

11:13.404 --> 11:15.706
and get naked
and roll around in it

11:15.773 --> 11:18.709
until it sticks
to my sweaty body.

12:07.759 --> 12:09.860
(phone rings)

12:09.928 --> 12:11.462
Sunshine Cab Company.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.663
Oh, hi, Elaine.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.698
It's you, huh?

12:13.765 --> 12:15.599
Oh, hi, Alex.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.702
So, is your life a shambles yet?

12:17.769 --> 12:18.936
Oh, come on, will you, Elaine?

12:19.004 --> 12:21.072
I, uh...
   I gambled a little while;

12:21.139 --> 12:24.809
I, uh, had a few laughs,
   and I came out about even.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.143
So you're home now, huh?

12:26.211 --> 12:27.478
Well, no, not exactly.

12:27.545 --> 12:29.346
I'm in a kind of a funny,
     out-of-the-way place,

12:29.414 --> 12:32.617
a kind of after-hour place
    on the Upper West Side.

12:32.684 --> 12:35.452
(toilet flushing)

12:36.555 --> 12:38.488
What was that?

12:38.556 --> 12:42.926
Oh, they're, they're watching a
rerun of <i>All in the Family</i> here.

12:42.994 --> 12:44.929
Listen, i-is, uh, Tony around?

12:44.996 --> 12:46.998
Uh, no, nobody's here
        but Jim and me.

12:47.065 --> 12:48.131
Let me talk to Jim.

12:49.234 --> 12:51.501
Jim, it's for you.

12:51.569 --> 12:53.504
Oh...

12:55.174 --> 12:57.107
ALEX (distant):
                      Hi, Jim...

12:57.175 --> 12:58.175
ELAINE:
                      It's Alex.

12:58.243 --> 12:59.944
(clearing throat)

13:06.484 --> 13:08.585
Okay, uh, go ahead.
       What is it, Alex?

13:08.653 --> 13:11.088
Okay, now, listen, Jim, I want
  you to run up to my locker.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.807
Okay, Alex, now what?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.809
ALEX:
           No, Jim...

13:31.877 --> 13:35.446
No, I want you to get something
        from my locker.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.315
I want...
             Okay!

13:37.382 --> 13:38.882
Jim!

13:38.950 --> 13:41.685
No, Jim!

13:42.787 --> 13:45.689
(rattling)

13:45.757 --> 13:47.691
(bangs)

13:54.966 --> 13:56.900
I can't get anything;
          it's locked.

13:56.968 --> 13:58.002
Jim...

13:58.070 --> 13:59.503
listen to me.

13:59.571 --> 14:03.907
I don't want you to go away
 from the phone unless I say--

14:03.975 --> 14:06.811
I better be very careful here.

14:06.878 --> 14:08.512
Accidents will happen.

14:08.580 --> 14:11.582
Okay, when you say
   "accidents will happen"...

14:11.649 --> 14:13.583
No, no, no, no!
          No, no, Jim.

14:13.651 --> 14:15.619
Oh, all right, why not?
             Okay.

14:15.687 --> 14:17.788
Look...

14:17.856 --> 14:20.857
Jim, the combination
         to the lock is

14:20.925 --> 14:23.861
3-14-60.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.195
Want to write that down?
            Uh-huh.

14:25.263 --> 14:26.630
No, I'll remember it

14:26.698 --> 14:29.467
because they're all ages
  that Frank Sinatra has been.

14:30.568 --> 14:33.337
All right, now, look--

14:33.405 --> 14:34.705
there's an envelope
         full of money

14:34.773 --> 14:36.340
in a Ritz cracker box
         in my locker.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.541
Uh-huh.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.010
All right?
 It's in the Ritz cracker box.

14:39.077 --> 14:41.812
Now, I want you to get
the envelope and bring it to me.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.081
I'll leave your name
 with the guy at the door here.

14:44.149 --> 14:47.117
Okay, w-w-w-where are you?

14:47.185 --> 14:49.420
All right,
 I'm at One West First Street.

14:49.487 --> 14:53.658
Wait, wait a minute,
   I better write that down.

14:53.725 --> 14:57.394
ALEX:
     One West First Street.

14:57.462 --> 14:59.063
Okay, I got it.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.698
All right, and hurry.

15:20.284 --> 15:22.386
(phone rings)

15:22.453 --> 15:24.521
Accidents will happen.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.395
I'm sorry, sir, the minimum bet
        is five dollars.

15:31.462 --> 15:34.031
Oh, come on, it's
                   my last buck.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.033
Let me bet
                   my last buck.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.536
Okay.

15:38.603 --> 15:40.304
Seven, a loser.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.973
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

15:44.042 --> 15:44.975
Get your bets down.

15:45.043 --> 15:46.977
New shooter.

15:47.045 --> 15:48.445
Jim!

15:48.513 --> 15:49.980
Where's my money?

15:50.048 --> 15:52.048
What, no exchange
   of pleasantries?

15:52.116 --> 15:53.284
Hello, Jim,
                  how you doing?

15:53.351 --> 15:54.351
Where's my money?

15:54.419 --> 15:55.352
Hello, Alex.

15:55.419 --> 15:56.353
Quite well, thank you.

15:56.421 --> 15:57.587
Care for a cracker?

15:57.655 --> 15:59.123
No-- hey,
                  wait a minute.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.725
Give me the box.

16:01.793 --> 16:02.926
Where's the envelope?

16:02.994 --> 16:04.562
There was an envelope
          full of money in the--

16:04.629 --> 16:06.397
I don't want the Ritz
  crackers; I want the envelope!

16:06.465 --> 16:07.765
Where's the envelope? What'd
       you do with the envelope?

16:07.833 --> 16:08.799
Where's that envelope?!

16:08.866 --> 16:10.134
Calm down, Alex!

16:10.202 --> 16:11.134
Where's the envelope,
           where's the envelope?

16:11.202 --> 16:12.169
The envelope isn't in there.

16:12.236 --> 16:13.671
It's in my pocket.
                      Huh?

16:13.738 --> 16:15.306
I took the precaution
of putting it here

16:15.373 --> 16:17.742
so I wouldn't eat
your money.

16:19.844 --> 16:22.780
Listen, uh, you don't know
         what I've been through.

16:22.847 --> 16:24.014
I was up 9,000 bucks.

16:24.082 --> 16:25.348
I'm flat broke now.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.851
And that means
you can't be civil?

16:26.918 --> 16:28.352
Huh?

16:28.420 --> 16:30.721
Here.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.722
I'm gonna give you
           back half this money.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.324
No matter how much I beg--

16:34.392 --> 16:35.392
no matter how
                    much I beg--

16:35.460 --> 16:36.960
I don't want you
               to give it to me.

16:37.028 --> 16:38.962
Gotcha.
                Good. Come here.

16:40.064 --> 16:41.998
Okay.

16:42.066 --> 16:43.434
You're going
to bet all of that?

16:43.502 --> 16:46.303
Yeah, because I know
         the next roll is an 11.

16:46.371 --> 16:47.537
Craps.

16:47.605 --> 16:49.073
Twelve.
                Damn!

16:49.141 --> 16:50.775
Well, you were
only off by one.

16:50.842 --> 16:52.543
How much do you get...

16:52.611 --> 16:54.311
How much do you
get for that?
                  Nothing!

16:54.379 --> 16:55.612
I'm broke.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.180
Well, then that was
pretty dumb of you

16:57.248 --> 16:58.915
to bet all of your
money like that.

17:00.651 --> 17:03.487
Remember that money I
           gave you and told you
             never to give me it

17:03.555 --> 17:04.721
no matter how much I beg?

17:04.789 --> 17:05.890
Yeah.
          Give me the money.

17:05.957 --> 17:06.957
Okeydoke.

17:12.730 --> 17:13.829
Thanks, Jim.

17:13.897 --> 17:15.031
You're welcome.

17:16.902 --> 17:17.968
Now, watch this,
                     watch this.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.301
I'm gonna put it
               all on the field.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.338
That way if a two,
         three, four, nine, ten,

17:21.405 --> 17:22.839
11 or 12 comes up,
                   I'm a winner.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.741
How can you lose?
                 Seven!

17:24.809 --> 17:26.675
That's how.
                        A loser.

17:26.743 --> 17:30.681
Well, the important
thing is we had fun.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.419
And we were polite.

17:35.487 --> 17:36.687
Now, let's go home.
                        Huh?

17:36.755 --> 17:39.123
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
           Come here, come here.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.557
You must have some
                   money on you.

17:40.625 --> 17:41.892
Why don't-- just loan
            me some money, okay?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.127
Oh, no, no, no,
you'll just lose it.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.294
Just loan me some
               money, will you?!

17:44.362 --> 17:45.529
No, Alex!

17:45.596 --> 17:47.564
You want to end up
like them--

17:47.632 --> 17:49.366
poor, lost souls?

17:49.434 --> 17:53.737
Wretched refuse on the
dung heap of human greed?

17:53.805 --> 17:55.406
Hey, hey, hey!
     All right, all right,
         we're leaving.

17:57.075 --> 17:58.909
You're not going
     to talk me into this.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.544
Why not? I'm going
                to pay you back.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.045
It's not the money.

18:02.113 --> 18:05.015
Look at yourself, Alex.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.218
I've seen this
    kind of behavior before.
                         Oh, no.

18:07.285 --> 18:08.853
No, no, Jim, Jim, just give me
      the money, will you?

18:08.920 --> 18:10.354
Just loan me the money!
    Just loan me the money!

18:10.421 --> 18:12.022
That's all I'm asking. Just loan
    me the money, will you?

18:14.125 --> 18:16.059
Okay!

18:17.729 --> 18:20.431
But first, hear me out.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.132
All right, all right, come on,
come on. What is it? What is it?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.167
You wouldn't know it
       to look at me now,

18:24.235 --> 18:26.536
but I wasn't always
         this together.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.441
But my problem wasn't gambling.

18:31.509 --> 18:33.444
It...

18:34.579 --> 18:36.280
It was drugs.

18:36.347 --> 18:38.415
Really? Well, that was
       a very nice chat.

18:38.483 --> 18:39.650
Just let me have the money.

18:39.717 --> 18:40.984
I couldn't stop
                     doing them.

18:41.052 --> 18:44.421
I always thought my next
         high would be the best.

18:44.488 --> 18:47.624
I couldn't quit until
              I hit rock bottom.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.259
Good. Now, just...

18:49.327 --> 18:50.660
Let me tell you about it.

18:50.728 --> 18:51.861
Is this going to take long?

18:51.929 --> 18:53.864
Yep.
  Oh, God.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.600
It was in a place

18:57.668 --> 19:00.270
just like this.

19:02.874 --> 19:05.475
Except there
                  were no sinks,

19:05.543 --> 19:07.377
and no mirrors.

19:07.445 --> 19:11.348
No walls, just sand

19:11.416 --> 19:15.219
as far as the eye could see.
       "Sand"?

19:15.286 --> 19:18.221
And a starry New Mexico sky.

19:18.289 --> 19:21.091
I was broke and friendless,

19:21.159 --> 19:23.593
except for an old
        Indian shaman...

19:25.564 --> 19:27.231
...who had taken me in...

19:27.299 --> 19:28.599
Come on!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.000
...and taught me the
             ways of his people.

19:32.737 --> 19:35.772
Do you know the things they
        value the highest, Alex?

19:35.840 --> 19:36.940
No, what? What?

19:37.008 --> 19:39.009
Honor and trust.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.811
"Honor and trust,"
good things to value.

19:40.878 --> 19:43.146
Good things.

19:43.214 --> 19:46.516
One night,
                 we were sitting

19:46.584 --> 19:48.752
on the edge of a cliff

19:48.820 --> 19:50.721
doing psychedelic
                      mushrooms.

19:59.597 --> 20:02.632
We were down to
               our last mushroom

20:02.700 --> 20:04.801
and both of us wanted it.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.705
So...

20:08.773 --> 20:11.441
I thought up this great plan

20:11.509 --> 20:13.243
to distract this man

20:13.311 --> 20:15.979
who had taught
                 me about trust.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.217
I looked up to the sky

20:21.285 --> 20:25.121
and I said,
      "Look at that star."

20:25.189 --> 20:26.790
And he looked.

20:26.857 --> 20:28.492
Who wouldn't?

20:31.863 --> 20:37.201
Then, when his attention
                 was distracted,

20:37.268 --> 20:39.536
I grabbed the mushroom

20:39.604 --> 20:41.171
and I was going to eat it.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.606
But I didn't.

20:42.673 --> 20:44.040
No?

20:44.108 --> 20:48.311
I gave it to him and he ate it.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.681
I see.
              And I felt better.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.249
Good, good.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.518
And it wasn't just
because he jumped off the cliff

20:54.585 --> 20:56.387
trying to fly.

21:01.559 --> 21:04.728
It was because
                  at that moment

21:04.795 --> 21:07.164
when I gave him
                   the mushroom,

21:07.232 --> 21:09.500
I knew I had the willpower

21:09.567 --> 21:12.836
so I never had to be
     at rock bottom again,

21:12.904 --> 21:14.738
like you are now.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.740
Alex!

21:16.808 --> 21:19.142
Hey, hey, come on.

21:19.210 --> 21:20.944
You don't have
       to worry about me.

21:21.012 --> 21:22.546
I'm not at rock bottom.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.915
No?

21:24.982 --> 21:28.284
What're you doing
    sitting in some toilet,

21:28.352 --> 21:30.186
after losing all your money

21:30.254 --> 21:33.290
and begging an easy mark
       for a few dollars

21:33.358 --> 21:36.459
and not getting it
                        from me?

21:40.998 --> 21:43.833
Welcome to rock bottom.

21:46.637 --> 21:48.105
Hey, Jim, wait.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.673
Wait a minute.
                     What is it?

21:49.741 --> 21:53.110
Uh, look...

21:53.177 --> 21:55.111
All I'm asking...

22:03.088 --> 22:05.922
Hey, Jim,
look at that light.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.405
Thanks.

22:55.473 --> 22:57.407
You helped me out.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.244
Come on.

23:05.316 --> 23:06.850
Come on, Jim,
let's go home.

23:06.917 --> 23:09.419
What's the rush?

23:09.487 --> 23:13.089
How often do you get
   to see a light like that?

23:24.602 --> 23:26.202
Yeah, it's a good light.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.448
(theme song playing)

24:02.874 --> 24:04.374
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:04.442 --> 24:05.408
(man grumbling)
