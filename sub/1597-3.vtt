19:11.917 --> 19:13.000
WHO LIKES THAT?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.375
- NO ONE.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.917
MM-HMM.
I DID IT AS A FAVOR.

19:16.917 --> 19:21.208
ANYWAY, HE WAS OUT
ON HIS ASS THE NEXT MORNING.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.000
I FILED FOR DIVORCE
THAT AFTERNOON.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.500
CLERK WAS LIKE, "BACK AGAIN?"

19:25.500 --> 19:27.000
- THIS IS
HUSBAND NUMBER THREE?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.959
- YEP.
THIRD TIME WAS NOT A CHARM.

19:29.959 --> 19:31.166
RIGHT, CHUCKIE?

19:31.166 --> 19:34.000
- YOU SEEM PRETTY UPBEAT,

- YES.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.417
EXACTLY.

19:42.417 --> 19:44.834
- YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH TIME OF IT.
- YEAH, I GUESS.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.583
SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SCARED
YOU OFF YET.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.000
- I DON'T SCARE THAT EASILY.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.209
- YOU HAVE BARELY TOUCHED
YOUR FRIES.

19:52.209 --> 19:53.583
ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T BUY
YOU ANOTHER BEER?

19:53.583 --> 19:55.834
- I DON'T REALLY DRINK.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.750
- YOU MIGHT BE THE FIRST MAN
THAT'S EVER SAID THAT TO ME.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.542

THAT AND AVOCADOS.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.583
[both groaning]

20:14.583 --> 20:17.166
- AVOCADOS ARE THE WORST...

20:17.166 --> 20:18.792
AND SQUIRRELS.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.291
- TREE RATS.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.250

20:56.500 --> 20:58.167
I'M KIND OF A SIMPLE GUY.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.333

21:34.375 --> 21:36.625
- AND I KNOW IT LOOKS
LIKE NANCY DID ALL THE WORK,

21:36.625 --> 21:40.042
BUT WASHING ALL THIS LETTUCE--
SERIOUS LABOR.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.291
- YOUR LADY SURE KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND A CUCUMBER.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.458
- WHOA! MOM.

21:44.458 --> 21:47.875
MAYBE CHOOSE
ANOTHER VEGETABLE NEXT TIME.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.458
NO ONE'S UP THERE,

23:22.458 --> 23:24.209
- ROBBIE,

23:24.209 --> 23:25.834
UM, WE DON'T WANT YOU UP THERE

23:25.834 --> 23:28.041
WITHOUT SOMEONE ELSE

23:28.041 --> 23:30.083
[bowl thumps]

23:30.083 --> 23:32.583
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS THE PAST.

23:32.583 --> 23:35.625
