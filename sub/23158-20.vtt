00:00.056 --> 00:03.048
Name's Elmo Ziller,
and I poke from Hondo, Texas.

00:03.126 --> 00:04.718
I got it.
It's the heat.

00:04.794 --> 00:05.988
You making fun?

00:06.062 --> 00:08.029
Elmo is
my half brother.

00:09.832 --> 00:11.595
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

00:11.667 --> 00:12.691
I wanna pull
your mustache.

00:12.769 --> 00:13.736
You wanna what?

00:13.803 --> 00:15.293
Are you both
joining the band?

00:15.371 --> 00:16.360
Higgins,
we're undercover.

00:18.241 --> 00:20.471
How many times
do we have to kill a guy?

00:20.543 --> 00:21.976
Till you
get it right!

00:22.095 --> 00:23.119
Let her rip.

02:28.721 --> 02:30.188
Here, time to earn
your bones, kid.

02:30.256 --> 02:31.723
Huh?
You slow in the head?

02:31.791 --> 02:32.815
This is your
initiation.

02:32.892 --> 02:33.984
I thought you were
gonna do...

02:34.060 --> 02:35.527
You thought wrong.
Hurry up.

02:45.171 --> 02:46.160
Now.

02:46.539 --> 02:48.131
Well, give me that.

03:00.186 --> 03:01.175
Here.

03:08.060 --> 03:09.049
Come on.

03:27.013 --> 03:28.002
Check him.

03:28.414 --> 03:29.938
You can do that,
can't you?

03:35.554 --> 03:36.953
I think he's dead.

03:40.092 --> 03:41.081
You sure?

03:44.096 --> 03:45.222
He looks dead.

03:45.464 --> 03:47.955
Well, you will be, too,
if you don't come on.

04:18.898 --> 04:21.423
<i>Every day in the tropics</i>
<i>is part illusion.</i>

04:21.500 --> 04:23.832
<i>Rain clouds are</i>
<i>actually rainbows,</i>

04:23.903 --> 04:26.064
<i>the perfect wave</i>
<i>breaks into a riptide.</i>

04:26.772 --> 04:29.866
<i>A conviction of immortality</i>
<i>grows out of the endless summer.</i>

04:30.576 --> 04:34.137
<i>What I should have remembered is</i>
<i>that illusion is always dangerous.</i>

04:34.880 --> 04:37.212
<i>But on a perfect morning</i>
<i>on the beach,</i>

04:37.283 --> 04:38.716
<i>who could remember fate?</i>

04:40.820 --> 04:44.950
# Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word #

04:45.257 --> 04:49.421
# And the skies
are not cloudy all day #

04:50.963 --> 04:52.260
What the...

04:52.331 --> 04:54.595
# Home, home on the range #

04:55.334 --> 04:59.964
# Where the deer
and the antelope play #

05:00.272 --> 05:03.833
# Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word #

05:03.909 --> 05:05.137
Hey! Hey!

05:05.211 --> 05:06.644
# And the sky ##

05:10.850 --> 05:12.841
Hey, hey, pardner.

05:12.918 --> 05:15.148
Hey, sorry
to bust in like this

05:15.221 --> 05:16.688
but your door was unlocked

05:16.756 --> 05:19.054
and I saw your guitar
here, so...

05:19.692 --> 05:21.182
Higgins,
what is this?

05:21.260 --> 05:22.852
It's too early
for Halloween.

05:23.362 --> 05:26.593
Name's Elmo Ziller,
and I poke from Hondo, Texas.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.226
Just 'cause I busted
your place, young fella,

05:29.301 --> 05:30.859
that ain't no cause
for you to...

05:30.936 --> 05:34.064
Oh, no. No, no, thank you.
But you go right ahead.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.404
I got it.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.372
I got it.
It's the heat.

05:41.447 --> 05:43.779
Too much time
in the garden without a hat.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.414
You makin' fun?

05:45.751 --> 05:48.015
'Cause where I come from,
that ain't funny.

05:48.087 --> 05:49.247
Right.

05:49.321 --> 05:50.652
Right.
I got it now.

05:51.924 --> 05:52.913
Howdy...

05:55.394 --> 05:57.259
No, I can do it.
I can do it.

05:57.630 --> 05:58.597
Here we go.

05:58.664 --> 06:01.292
Howdy, pardner.
You just ride into town?

06:02.168 --> 06:04.728
Somebody told me you was a
pretty good old detective.

06:04.804 --> 06:07.637
Terrific. I ain't had a
rustlin' case all year.

06:08.941 --> 06:10.499
I guess I been steered wrong.
No!

06:10.576 --> 06:11.565
So if you'll
excuse me...

06:11.644 --> 06:13.009
No, don't mosey.

06:13.078 --> 06:14.670
You just make
yourself to home.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.538
Pour yourself
some rotgut.

06:16.849 --> 06:18.214
Chew some tobacco.

06:18.284 --> 06:20.878
See, I'm headin' up to the
ranch house to see Higgins.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.688
So you just be still
and stay right there.

06:25.491 --> 06:27.186
I love the mustache.

06:45.811 --> 06:46.800
Higgins!

07:06.432 --> 07:08.263
You aren't here,
are you, Higgins?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.231
You're down in my
guesthouse acting like...

07:10.302 --> 07:11.701
Magnum, please.

07:14.073 --> 07:15.233
Hoot Gibson.

07:17.776 --> 07:20.973
I can't imagine that all this
racket is absolutely necessary.

07:21.614 --> 07:24.447
I gotta hand it to you, Higgins,
you changed pretty fast.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.607
I beg your pardon.

07:25.684 --> 07:27.151
Come on,
how'd you do it?

07:27.620 --> 07:29.520
I say, Magnum,
are you quite all right?

07:29.722 --> 07:32.282
Oh, don't get regimental
on me, buckaroo.

07:32.358 --> 07:34.690
You "poke from Hondo, Texas,"
remember?

07:35.494 --> 07:36.620
I see.

07:36.896 --> 07:39.922
In your own crude way,
you've explained yourself.

07:39.999 --> 07:42.160
Explained?
Nothing's explained.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.735
You have met,
as it were, Elmo.

07:47.206 --> 07:48.173
Elmo?

07:48.240 --> 07:51.004
Oh, be a good chap
and help me out with my gear.

07:51.076 --> 07:52.065
Higgins.

07:53.445 --> 07:54.434
Higgins!

07:57.116 --> 07:58.879
What is going on?

07:58.951 --> 08:01.112
It is a melancholy
but inevitable fact

08:01.186 --> 08:03.279
that all great families
are burdened with

08:03.355 --> 08:05.414
what can be most delicately
described as...

08:05.491 --> 08:06.924
Right in there
will do nicely.

08:06.992 --> 08:08.186
Higgins,
who is Elmo?

08:08.594 --> 08:10.562
Lmpossible though
it may be

08:10.629 --> 08:13.462
for someone of your limited
imagination to absorb,

08:14.066 --> 08:16.057
Elmo is my
half brother.

08:17.603 --> 08:18.592
Now,

08:19.371 --> 08:22.135
for the next two weeks,
I'll be taking my vacation,

08:23.609 --> 08:25.406
staying on the other side
of the island

08:25.477 --> 08:27.308
at a lovely
residential hotel.

08:28.247 --> 08:30.477
I've written down
all the mundane details

08:30.549 --> 08:33.780
including some rather specific
instructions regarding the lads' diet.

08:35.254 --> 08:36.312
Hold it.

08:36.889 --> 08:37.913
Hold it right there.

08:37.990 --> 08:42.154
No one is going anyplace until
I get a thorough explanation.

08:43.227 --> 08:46.595
Coexistence in even remotely
the same environs with Elmo

08:46.665 --> 08:50.226
is aesthetically corrupting and
intellectually life-threatening.

08:51.103 --> 08:52.968
You, however,
are a perfect match,

08:53.172 --> 08:55.106
which is why I recommended
that he hire you

08:55.174 --> 08:57.836
when he came to me
with his appalling story.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.707
Now, driver,
out the gate.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.369
Higgins.

09:16.996 --> 09:17.985
Elmo!

09:30.242 --> 09:31.971
And the best part is,

09:32.711 --> 09:34.372
when he comes out
as Higgins

09:34.713 --> 09:35.907
in his house,

09:36.815 --> 09:38.908
I was sure I could see
this little line of glue

09:38.984 --> 09:40.975
where he'd put on
the big mustache.

09:41.153 --> 09:42.620
What'd you say
this guy's name was?

09:42.688 --> 09:44.451
There is no
"this guy," Rick.

09:44.556 --> 09:45.545
Don't you know...

09:45.624 --> 09:46.556
Elmo.

09:46.625 --> 09:49.560
"Elmo Ziller-l-poke-
from-Hondo, Texas."

09:51.096 --> 09:53.326
Hey, man, why would Higgins
go through all the trouble

09:53.399 --> 09:55.458
to dress up like a cowboy
and then wear a fake...

09:55.534 --> 09:56.558
Guys, listen to me.

09:56.635 --> 09:58.262
It's some kind of
practical joke.

09:58.337 --> 10:00.430
Some kind of trick
to get even, you know,

10:00.506 --> 10:02.804
for some kind of
imagined insult or something.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.708
Yeah. Well, it's a pretty
expensive joke. Listen to this:

10:05.811 --> 10:07.005
"Opening Tuesday.

10:07.079 --> 10:08.478
"Starring for three days only.

10:08.547 --> 10:12.643
Bronco Elmo's Authentic
Death-defying Texas Rodeo and..."

10:15.120 --> 10:17.953
"Authentic Texas Rodeo
and Old West Roundup.

10:18.090 --> 10:20.320
$25,000
first prize."

10:20.426 --> 10:22.792
Maybe Elmo wants you
to wrestle a bull.

10:23.095 --> 10:25.996
That would be death-defying
enough for me to pay $25,000.

10:26.065 --> 10:28.932
Guys, I'm telling you.
This is some kind of a...

10:29.001 --> 10:30.298
Hi.
Hi.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.667
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Thomas Magnum, the investigator.

10:33.739 --> 10:34.899
This is the place.

10:35.007 --> 10:36.907
See what I mean?
He doesn't give up.

10:38.877 --> 10:39.866
Hi.
Hi.

10:39.945 --> 10:41.037
I'm Rick.
Hi, Rick.

10:41.113 --> 10:42.045
This is T.C.

10:42.114 --> 10:43.172
Hello, T.C.
Howdy.

10:43.282 --> 10:44.943
And this guy with the grin on his face

10:45.017 --> 10:47.076
is the investigator
Thomas Magnum.

10:47.152 --> 10:48.141
Hi.

10:48.220 --> 10:50.347
Can I get you something cold to drink?
Oh, great.

10:50.422 --> 10:52.913
I had a roundup breakfast,
but that was at 5:30 this morning.

10:55.227 --> 10:56.285
Oh, listen,

10:56.361 --> 10:58.192
you know, your accent is
really very good.

10:58.263 --> 11:00.527
Are you in drama
at the university?

11:01.100 --> 11:03.295
Come on, you can tell us.
The joke's over.

11:04.603 --> 11:06.127
I guess the joke's on me.

11:06.538 --> 11:07.732
Oh, no, don't look at me.

11:07.806 --> 11:10.604
I'm still trying to get over
"roundup breakfast."

11:10.676 --> 11:12.371
Don't pay any attention
to him.

11:12.444 --> 11:15.413
Too much time watching helicopter
blades going around, Miss...

11:15.481 --> 11:17.073
Lexi. Lexi Ziller.

11:18.817 --> 11:20.648
And even though
I come from a town

11:20.719 --> 11:22.414
with two gas stations
and one house,

11:22.488 --> 11:24.513
I don't want you to think
I'm a hick.

11:24.823 --> 11:26.654
I've been to lots of cities
with the rodeo,

11:26.725 --> 11:29.023
and I know
I gotta pay cash money

11:29.294 --> 11:30.886
for a private investigator.

11:30.963 --> 11:33.932
Good grief. That's more money than
this investigator's ever seen.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.091
T.C.

11:35.734 --> 11:37.998
Look, Lexi,
or whatever your name is,

11:38.070 --> 11:41.039
why don't you cut this out now before
anybody gets their feelings hurt.

11:41.106 --> 11:42.630
Why don't you just
go to Higgins

11:42.708 --> 11:45.302
and tell him you did your part
but it didn't work out.

11:45.377 --> 11:49.006
It's $750 from my barrel
racing money from this spring.

11:49.681 --> 11:52.309
And look, if you're not gonna help me,
you say so now

11:52.384 --> 11:55.080
so I can find somebody else,
'cause my daddy needs help real bad.

11:55.154 --> 11:58.282
Okay. Why don't you just
tell us what the problem is?

11:58.357 --> 11:59.915
Marcella, my stepmother,

12:00.359 --> 12:02.793
the meanest woman to
ever draw breath in Nevada.

12:04.897 --> 12:06.455
She tried to kill Elmo?

12:06.532 --> 12:07.521
How'd you know?

12:07.599 --> 12:09.760
Oh, come on, guys.
Cut it out.

12:10.068 --> 12:12.969
Man, it don't hurt to listen
to the story. Just be cool.

12:13.038 --> 12:15.666
Because if you're volunteering
to help, I know it's a joke.

12:15.741 --> 12:17.834
An elaborate,
vicious practical joke,

12:17.910 --> 12:19.844
and I'm not buying it,
thank you very much.

12:20.512 --> 12:22.742
Well, Thomas.
Hey, hey!

12:23.348 --> 12:24.975
Come on.
Give this kid a break.

12:25.050 --> 12:27.610
I can spot a con
a mile away just like this,

12:27.686 --> 12:29.051
and she's legit.

12:52.010 --> 12:53.602
I saw Mr. Magnum today.

12:53.679 --> 12:55.670
I think he's
gonna take the case.

12:56.982 --> 12:58.006
It bothers me,
though.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.812
He seems like
such a decent man.

13:02.087 --> 13:04.578
But in a couple of days,
if our plan works,

13:05.891 --> 13:07.882
this will be all be over,
won't it?

13:11.496 --> 13:12.554
Yup.

13:25.494 --> 13:28.588
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>but this time you're wrong.</i>

13:28.898 --> 13:30.559
<i>Higgins was up to</i>
<i>something,</i>

13:30.633 --> 13:33.193
<i>but as long as I knew</i>
<i>he was trying to trick me,</i>

13:33.335 --> 13:35.132
<i>I was ok, right?</i>

13:35.204 --> 13:38.002
<i>It's only when you don't know</i>
<i>you're involved in a practical joke</i>

13:38.073 --> 13:39.370
<i>that you're in danger.</i>

13:40.309 --> 13:42.937
Excuse me, I'm... I'm looking
for Elmo Ziller.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.910
Bronco's just
sitting down for breakfast.

13:44.980 --> 13:46.004
Thank you.

13:46.081 --> 13:49.107
<i>Of course, if I'd remembered</i>
<i>about the danger of illusion</i>

13:49.385 --> 13:52.047
<i>maybe I wouldn't have been</i>
<i>quite so confident.</i>

13:56.825 --> 13:58.258
Mornin', Elmo.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.125
Mind if I join you?

14:02.865 --> 14:04.457
You gonna talk smart?

14:05.834 --> 14:08.997
Your daughter tried to hire
me yesterday to protect you.

14:09.138 --> 14:11.971
I just couldn't take the job
without talking to you first.

14:17.713 --> 14:18.907
Had your breakfast?

14:18.981 --> 14:19.948
No.

14:21.617 --> 14:23.448
What are you eating?

14:25.154 --> 14:27.952
Chili and scrambled eggs
on sourdough pancakes.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.415
Needs more hot sauce, though.

14:33.395 --> 14:35.056
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

14:35.130 --> 14:36.290
I wanna pull
your mustache.

14:36.365 --> 14:37.389
You wanna what?

14:37.466 --> 14:38.728
Daddy, what's
going on here?

14:38.801 --> 14:41.031
This Hawaiian detective
tried to pull my mustache.

14:41.103 --> 14:42.695
I just wanna
see if it's real.

14:42.771 --> 14:43.760
You look so much like...

14:43.839 --> 14:44.863
Who?

14:48.911 --> 14:50.173
Jonathan?

14:56.852 --> 14:57.944
Well,

14:59.321 --> 15:02.518
I see you ain't gonna take me
serious till you got some proof.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.891
Tell them to put Lightning
in the chute.

15:06.962 --> 15:07.986
Daddy, not Lightning.

15:08.063 --> 15:09.030
You heard me.

15:09.098 --> 15:10.087
Higgins.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.292
Elmo,

15:12.368 --> 15:14.836
could you just tell me
who's trying to kill you?

15:17.239 --> 15:18.399
You workin' for me?

15:18.474 --> 15:20.635
Yes. Yes.
I'm on the case!

15:20.709 --> 15:22.142
Now can you tell me?

15:24.380 --> 15:27.747
Your daughter mentioned something
about your wife, Marcella.

15:30.319 --> 15:31.308
Come on.

15:34.623 --> 15:37.353
Hey, Dan, stick my guns
in the trailer, will you?

15:39.294 --> 15:40.522
Three or four months ago,

15:40.596 --> 15:43.895
a couple varmints bushwhacked
me outside El Paso.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.657
You mean they
tried to kill you?

15:45.734 --> 15:47.463
Well, three shots
through the windshield

15:47.536 --> 15:49.595
before the truck
turned over, caught fire.

15:49.672 --> 15:50.730
What happened?

15:51.840 --> 15:53.705
You mean,
after they left me for dead?

15:55.044 --> 15:57.274
Damn fools. All I had
was a busted leg.

15:57.346 --> 15:58.438
You got picked up?

15:59.248 --> 16:01.614
I walked back to town,
of course.

16:03.552 --> 16:06.214
You walked back
to town on a...

16:07.523 --> 16:08.615
How far?

16:08.824 --> 16:11.691
Five miles by road,
but I cut across the desert

16:11.760 --> 16:13.523
'cause I didn't
want them to spot me,

16:13.595 --> 16:15.688
so come closer to ten.

16:17.599 --> 16:18.588
Higgins.

16:20.269 --> 16:22.430
Higgins,
listen to me.

16:22.671 --> 16:24.332
However you're doing this,

16:24.606 --> 16:26.506
why ever you're playing
this game with me,

16:26.575 --> 16:28.406
stop it right now.
Don't ride this.

16:28.477 --> 16:30.206
Are you ready, boys?

16:30.279 --> 16:32.839
Look, I know your pride,
but you can quit right now and...

16:32.915 --> 16:34.075
Let her rip.

17:03.312 --> 17:04.279
I'm sorry.

17:04.813 --> 17:06.040
It makes me
really nervous.

17:06.147 --> 17:09.584
I mean, it's... it's crazy at his
age doin' something like that.

17:17.626 --> 17:18.615
Oh.

17:23.898 --> 17:24.923
Marcella.

17:31.206 --> 17:34.039
Lexi, honey.
How are you? Mmm.

17:34.109 --> 17:36.304
I have been looking
for you for months.

17:36.578 --> 17:39.638
Well, two seconds earlier and
you could have seen Daddy ride.

17:39.715 --> 17:41.342
He's still a champ.

17:43.352 --> 17:44.979
That's not Elmo.

17:47.456 --> 17:49.151
Lexi, why are you
doing this to me?

17:49.224 --> 17:50.452
Doing what,
Marcella?

17:50.526 --> 17:52.289
Tormenting me
like this.

17:52.594 --> 17:55.256
Honey, everybody knows
that your daddy is dead.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.264
Now, denying it
is not gonna to help.

17:57.332 --> 17:59.892
Now I've spoken to
a very good doctor about you.

17:59.968 --> 18:01.959
He says
that if you'll just admit

18:02.037 --> 18:04.096
that that wonderful man
is gone...

18:04.173 --> 18:05.538
That wonderful man

18:06.742 --> 18:07.970
is gone to the stables.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.874
Why don't you go
see for yourself?

18:09.945 --> 18:11.537
He is dead.

18:12.114 --> 18:14.582
Nobody could have lived
through that burning truck.

18:14.950 --> 18:16.144
God bless his soul.

18:16.385 --> 18:17.647
Elmo did.

18:17.953 --> 18:20.217
And there aren't gonna be
any more accidents.

18:20.355 --> 18:23.017
This here's Thomas Magnum,
the famous investigator.

18:23.692 --> 18:24.716
Howdy.

18:26.128 --> 18:28.119
He's protecting Daddy
while we're here.

18:29.231 --> 18:30.823
As a matter of fact,
Marcella,

18:31.333 --> 18:32.800
why don't you
buy a ticket?

18:32.868 --> 18:34.802
You can see him
any night you want.

18:36.104 --> 18:37.435
The show's not folding?

18:37.539 --> 18:38.938
No. We're a big success.

18:39.007 --> 18:40.474
The new equipment's
payin' off.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.066
We even have a TV deal.

18:43.345 --> 18:45.336
Miss Lexi, your pa
said he was going down

18:45.414 --> 18:47.382
to the newspaper office
for an interview.

18:47.449 --> 18:49.314
He'll be back in time
for the show.

18:51.019 --> 18:53.783
Well, I don't believe
any of this.

18:55.190 --> 18:57.249
Well, why don't you go down
to the newspaper office

18:57.326 --> 18:58.816
and find out for yourself?

18:59.428 --> 19:01.726
And I don't believe
private investigators.

19:01.797 --> 19:03.264
Now, this is a trick.

19:03.565 --> 19:05.692
You're trying to cheat me
like that damn Elmo did.

19:05.767 --> 19:06.791
But it's not gonna work.

19:06.869 --> 19:08.962
You see, there are lawyers
and there are courts,

19:09.037 --> 19:11.267
and I am gonna get
what is coming to me.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.308
Oh, Marcella,
you don't know how much I hope

19:13.375 --> 19:15.570
you get exactly
what's coming to you.

19:17.212 --> 19:18.839
Elmo used to talk
like that.

19:20.015 --> 19:21.448
Look what happened
to him.

19:23.719 --> 19:25.653
She's married to Elmo?

19:27.322 --> 19:30.416
About ten years ago,
the rodeo was in Reno.

19:30.726 --> 19:33.024
Daddy and some buddies
picked up some chorus giris.

19:33.095 --> 19:35.689
Oh. So when he woke up
in the morning,

19:35.764 --> 19:37.391
Marcella was Mrs. Elmo.

19:37.466 --> 19:39.263
We didn't hear from her
for a long time.

19:39.334 --> 19:41.928
Then, about a year ago,
the rodeo was in trouble

19:42.004 --> 19:43.972
and we thought
we might have to sell out.

19:44.039 --> 19:45.768
She shows up
yelling for half.

19:46.408 --> 19:48.205
You said something
about new equipment?

19:48.277 --> 19:49.835
Daddy wouldn't
sell the rodeo.

19:49.912 --> 19:52.676
So he borrowed some money to
fix things up like old again.

19:53.015 --> 19:54.312
What about
the TV Deal?

19:54.383 --> 19:55.748
Well, that was my idea,

19:55.817 --> 19:58.251
you know how they have
those special programs

19:58.320 --> 20:00.754
where those stars play
tug of war and circus?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.224
That sounds like
a nice piece of change.

20:03.292 --> 20:04.816
Enough to pay off
the loans.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.621
So we've got
to keep Elmo safe.

20:07.262 --> 20:08.752
Besides, he's my daddy.

20:12.601 --> 20:15.263
You going to the newspaper
to tell him Marcella's here?

20:15.337 --> 20:17.703
No. I've got one other thing
to check out first.

20:22.878 --> 20:24.470
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

20:24.546 --> 20:27.037
<i>Just because I couldn't</i>
<i>pull off the moustache,</i>

20:27.115 --> 20:28.707
<i>even though I'd seen</i>
<i>a bronc ride</i>

20:28.784 --> 20:30.547
<i>that would've</i>
<i>killed a normal man,</i>

20:30.719 --> 20:33.017
<i>somehow I knew</i>
<i>it was Higgins</i>

20:33.088 --> 20:35.249
<i>hiding under that</i>
<i>10-gallon hat.</i>

20:35.324 --> 20:37.383
<i>And I knew one way</i>
<i>for sure to prove it.</i>

20:42.431 --> 20:43.455
Excuse me.

20:43.532 --> 20:44.999
Ma'am, excuse me.

20:45.334 --> 20:46.858
I'm terribly sorry.

20:47.336 --> 20:49.167
We are a private club.

20:49.571 --> 20:51.971
Oh. That's okay.
I don't want to check in.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.736
Could you tell me if you have a
Jonathan Higgins registered here?

20:54.810 --> 20:58.075
I'm not allowed
to divulge that information.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.369
Of course.

20:59.648 --> 21:02.879
Maybe I could leave him a message,
or else I could wait for him.

21:02.951 --> 21:05.283
That's not possible,
I'm afraid.

21:06.822 --> 21:09.450
The bell captain
will show you out.

21:10.058 --> 21:11.525
He isn't here, is he?

21:11.727 --> 21:14.594
He left you a big tip not
to give out any information,

21:14.663 --> 21:16.563
but after he checked in,
he left, didn't he?

21:16.631 --> 21:17.723
Certainly not.

21:17.899 --> 21:19.628
That's fine.
Oh, no, that's fine.

21:19.701 --> 21:22.226
I won't tell him how helpful
you've really been.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.251
Higgins?

21:49.664 --> 21:50.688
Magnum.

21:51.733 --> 21:53.291
You gave me
quite a start.

21:54.069 --> 21:55.900
Nothing wrong
at the estate, I trust.

21:55.971 --> 21:56.995
Not one of the lads.

21:57.072 --> 21:58.004
No.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.903
No, everything's
just fine.

22:01.076 --> 22:03.977
Magnum, may I presume to say
you look simply dreadful.

22:04.379 --> 22:07.644
Why don't you sit down before you
attract attention by fainting?

22:11.520 --> 22:12.509
Uh,

22:13.922 --> 22:15.116
some food, perhaps?

22:15.190 --> 22:17.351
The eggs Benedict are simply... No.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.525
No, everything's just...

22:19.594 --> 22:20.754
Fine. Yes.

22:20.829 --> 22:23.059
I believe you've already
relayed that information

22:23.131 --> 22:25.861
with all the vividness usually
associated with a telegram.

22:27.335 --> 22:30.304
I came here to tell you that I
went to work for your brother.

22:30.906 --> 22:32.635
Half brother.

22:37.813 --> 22:39.212
I suppose I shall
have to reveal

22:39.281 --> 22:41.875
the whole degrading,
sordid story.

22:41.950 --> 22:43.281
Higgins,
I do not want to...

22:43.351 --> 22:45.114
Please.
Keep your voice down.

22:46.855 --> 22:49.483
I'm relying
on your sacred word

22:49.558 --> 22:51.219
as a gentleman not to...

22:53.328 --> 22:57.492
That is, I'm going to ask you to keep
this in the strictest confidence.

22:57.799 --> 23:00.199
Believe me, all I want

23:00.268 --> 23:02.327
is a few questions
answered. First...

23:02.404 --> 23:04.429
It all began
in the summer of 1919

23:04.506 --> 23:06.701
when my father was
part of the military section

23:06.775 --> 23:08.470
attached to
the British delegation

23:08.543 --> 23:10.511
to the Versailles
Peace Conference.

23:10.879 --> 23:12.972
The old boy was
stricken with influenza,

23:13.048 --> 23:14.345
and not to make excuses,

23:14.416 --> 23:17.351
but it was a ghastly business
with tens of thousands dying.

23:17.419 --> 23:18.443
Higgins.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.387
There was this
American Red Cross nurse.

23:21.623 --> 23:22.954
From Texas.

23:23.325 --> 23:25.759
Loud, coarse, vulgar.

23:26.161 --> 23:27.856
A tart, actually.

23:29.030 --> 23:30.190
Elmo's mother?

23:32.033 --> 23:33.591
And your father
told you this?

23:33.668 --> 23:35.033
Well, of course not.

23:35.103 --> 23:37.663
But one can apply
deductive reasoning.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.238
In his weakened,
wretched state, my father was...

23:42.244 --> 23:43.506
grateful.

23:44.045 --> 23:45.239
And, she, realizing

23:45.313 --> 23:47.406
she had the flower of
British manhood in her care,

23:47.482 --> 23:50.576
took advantage of him
in a primitive, physical way.

23:50.652 --> 23:52.347
This is not
an easy story to tell.

23:52.420 --> 23:53.978
You're handling it
like a man.

23:54.055 --> 23:55.488
What did your mother do?

23:56.124 --> 23:59.423
After she had welcomed him
home, into her arms,

23:59.761 --> 24:02.252
my father, being a gentleman,
confessed all.

24:02.330 --> 24:03.888
My mother,
being a great lady

24:03.965 --> 24:06.490
filled with Christian compassion,
forgave him.

24:06.568 --> 24:09.435
And, of course, never allowed
the beast to touch her again.

24:10.038 --> 24:13.496
Elmo and I were born
almost at the same time.

24:13.575 --> 24:16.100
I'm sorry, madam.
This club is for members only.

24:16.178 --> 24:18.271
Don't worry 'bout it.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

24:18.346 --> 24:20.940
The symbolism is almost
too perfect, don't you think?

24:21.016 --> 24:22.643
The child of the weakness
of the flesh

24:22.717 --> 24:24.309
in contrast with
the child of perfect.

24:24.386 --> 24:27.014
Have you ever met
Elmo's current wife?

24:28.056 --> 24:29.853
Really, Magnum,
what do you take me for?

24:29.925 --> 24:31.756
We're about to
find out.

24:31.927 --> 24:34.157
Well, that's got to be him,

24:35.664 --> 24:37.598
with that
slimy detective.

24:38.733 --> 24:40.098
I beg your pardon?

24:40.168 --> 24:41.226
Right here.
Right here.

24:41.303 --> 24:42.497
Elmo Ziller?

24:42.971 --> 24:44.563
I most certainly
am not.

24:44.639 --> 24:46.504
Oh, well, that is exactly

24:46.575 --> 24:48.566
who he has been saying
that he is!

24:48.643 --> 24:50.008
Except that he is a fraud,

24:50.078 --> 24:52.012
trying to cheat
an innocent widow

24:52.080 --> 24:54.378
by impersonating
her dead husband.

24:55.150 --> 24:57.175
Officer, do your duty.

24:57.953 --> 25:00.353
This is a subpoena
for you to appear in court.

25:00.622 --> 25:02.988
Failure to appear will
result in your arrest.

25:03.058 --> 25:04.650
Do you understand, sir?

25:04.726 --> 25:08.218
I assure you I am quite conversant
with the English language.

25:08.563 --> 25:10.588
I demand to know
the meaning of this.

25:10.765 --> 25:13.563
The meaning of
this is, buster,

25:14.469 --> 25:16.630
I am going to prove
you a fake.

25:18.807 --> 25:20.900
There are fingerprints,
you know.

25:21.276 --> 25:24.336
And when I prove that Elmo
is definitely dead,

25:24.546 --> 25:27.379
I am going to get
what is rightfully mine.

25:28.183 --> 25:30.117
See you in court, Elmo.

25:54.710 --> 25:57.770
<i>Ever notice how life enjoys</i>
<i>pulling the rug out?</i>

25:58.480 --> 26:01.074
<i>Just when I'd decided</i>
<i>Higgins wasn't Elmo,</i>

26:01.183 --> 26:02.650
<i>Elmo's wife shows up</i>

26:02.718 --> 26:05.346
<i>and illusion and reality</i>
<i>start getting scrambled.</i>

26:05.854 --> 26:08.789
<i>All I knew for sure was</i>
<i>Marcella looked tough enough</i>

26:08.857 --> 26:10.484
<i>to pull the trigger</i>
<i>on anybody.</i>

26:10.993 --> 26:14.258
<i>Elmo, alive or dead,</i>
<i>had my sympathies.</i>

26:14.930 --> 26:15.954
Magnum!

26:18.433 --> 26:20.594
Higgins, you're back.

26:21.937 --> 26:25.031
Your keen perception
never fails to astonish me.

26:26.141 --> 26:28.405
Nor your proclivity
for petty theft.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.302
Nor your wanton disregard

26:30.379 --> 26:32.347
for the dietary requirements
of the lads.

26:32.414 --> 26:33.642
Why are you back?

26:33.715 --> 26:36.013
Because I knew.
I just instinctively knew

26:36.084 --> 26:38.075
that you would take
advantage of my absence

26:38.153 --> 26:39.381
to cavalierly destroy

26:39.454 --> 26:42.014
the entire moral and
social fiber of this estate.

26:42.090 --> 26:43.079
Higgins.

26:45.093 --> 26:47.527
Actually, after that
sordid scene at the hotel,

26:47.596 --> 26:49.154
I thought it best to return.

26:49.598 --> 26:51.065
So they threw you out,
huh?

27:02.044 --> 27:03.068
Magnum,

27:03.779 --> 27:05.337
it is my considered
conclusion

27:05.414 --> 27:08.212
that the only way I can
remove this blot from my name

27:10.352 --> 27:13.947
is by showing myself at the
rodeo grounds while Elmo's there.

27:14.189 --> 27:16.248
As Elmo's
hired detective,

27:17.426 --> 27:20.486
I thought, perhaps you'd like to lend
some assistance to this endeavor.

27:20.562 --> 27:21.460
Me? How?

27:21.530 --> 27:23.054
By finding that
disgusting woman

27:23.131 --> 27:25.395
under whatever rock she
happens to have slithered under

27:25.467 --> 27:26.491
and bring her
to the arena

27:26.568 --> 27:29.662
so the truth will finally become
evident to her overly made-up eyes.

27:29.738 --> 27:30.727
Gee, Higgins.

27:33.008 --> 27:35.203
Doesn't that seem like a lot
of trouble to go through?

27:35.277 --> 27:37.268
Why don't you just
show up in court next week?

27:37.345 --> 27:39.472
Because I want
to prove it today!

27:42.984 --> 27:46.249
There are still those of us for
whom a good name is held dear.

27:47.322 --> 27:48.448
Gee, I don't know,
Higgins.

27:48.523 --> 27:49.820
I gotta protect Elmo.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.016
I'll protect him.

27:51.093 --> 27:52.287
You are Elmo.
Magnum.

27:53.128 --> 27:55.562
Okay. Okay.

27:55.764 --> 27:56.958
I was just fishing.

27:57.232 --> 27:58.961
There's just one thing,
though, Higgins.

27:59.034 --> 28:01.298
If somebody is trying
to kill Elmo, well,

28:01.903 --> 28:04.599
you know, the two of you
do look a little bit alike.

28:04.873 --> 28:08.400
A lamentable fact of which I am
lately constantly being reminded.

28:08.610 --> 28:09.736
Magnum, what's
your point?

28:09.811 --> 28:13.144
What I'm trying to say is,
they might kill you by mistake.

28:13.815 --> 28:16.511
Your solicitude is very touching,
but unnecessary.

28:18.186 --> 28:20.780
Just bring me the head
of Marcella Ziller.

28:26.528 --> 28:27.995
You told me he was dead.

28:28.063 --> 28:30.395
You promised me
he was dead!

28:31.199 --> 28:32.461
He is, ma'am.

28:32.534 --> 28:34.593
Ain't nobody could've
lived through that fire.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.601
Nobody.

28:36.004 --> 28:38.336
Oh, really? Really?
And I suppose that that guy

28:38.406 --> 28:40.840
riding around that ring
is all imaginary, huh?

28:46.181 --> 28:47.170
Okay.

28:47.349 --> 28:48.338
Okay.

28:49.985 --> 28:52.647
Maybe it is that brother
that I found at that hotel.

28:53.355 --> 28:56.085
I mean, he does look
a lot like Elmo, you know.

28:56.158 --> 28:57.386
Only wimpy.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.620
Miss Ziller, just tell us
what you want.

29:03.331 --> 29:05.629
I want what is mine.

29:07.002 --> 29:10.199
And you two boys are
supposed to help me get that.

29:11.106 --> 29:12.232
We did.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.570
Leastways,
I think we did.

29:16.578 --> 29:20.105
Miss Ziller, how many times
do we have to kill a guy?

29:20.448 --> 29:22.143
Till you get it right!

29:45.874 --> 29:46.863
I say,

29:47.676 --> 29:49.610
are you both
joining the band?

29:50.512 --> 29:52.002
Higgins,
we're undercover.

29:52.347 --> 29:53.245
Not me.

29:53.315 --> 29:56.148
I just always wanted to see
what it was like to be a cowboy.

29:57.152 --> 29:59.120
Magnum put you up
to this, admit it.

29:59.354 --> 30:02.517
Well, he did kind of want us to
keep an eye out for your brother.

30:02.757 --> 30:03.917
Half brother.

30:03.992 --> 30:06.187
While he went looking
for that Marcella lady.

30:06.428 --> 30:08.362
I assure you,
she's no lady.

30:09.297 --> 30:10.286
Have, uh,

30:10.765 --> 30:13.461
have either of you
seen Bronco Elmo?

30:14.402 --> 30:17.064
He's right over there,
Higgins. He just rode in.

30:23.812 --> 30:25.211
If you'll excuse me.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.373
Um, we're gonna
go with you.

30:28.049 --> 30:30.210
Um, private moment,
I think.

30:30.652 --> 30:32.620
Until the other afternoon
at Robin's Nest,

30:32.687 --> 30:35.087
I'd only met
my half brother once before.

30:35.357 --> 30:37.120
Briefly,
during the war.

30:37.325 --> 30:39.293
The conversation was short

30:39.494 --> 30:41.621
and rather one-sided,
as I recall.

30:41.997 --> 30:43.794
It occurred at 1500 hours

30:43.865 --> 30:46.527
on the afternoon
of June 6, 1944,

30:46.935 --> 30:48.869
on Gold Beach
in Normandy.

30:48.937 --> 30:51.098
D- day? You ran into
your brother on D-day?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.131
I spotted him
standing like an idiot

30:54.209 --> 30:56.234
amidst the firing
and I shouted:

30:56.311 --> 30:59.337
"Get your ruddy posterior down
before it's shot off."

31:00.782 --> 31:02.773
It was rather charitable,
I've always thought,

31:02.851 --> 31:04.443
given his
unseemly background.

31:12.327 --> 31:14.852
What kind of jobs do you
think Lexi will give us?

31:15.130 --> 31:16.290
I don't know.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.561
But she said it was something
we could both do real easy.

31:22.937 --> 31:25.906
Clowns! You gotta be kidding!
Clowns? Me a clown?

31:27.175 --> 31:29.939
Hey, I think you guys
look real cute.

31:30.011 --> 31:31.740
Oh, yeah,
real cute.

31:32.013 --> 31:33.503
I'm gonna kill him
this time.

31:33.581 --> 31:35.105
And nobody's
gonna stop me.

31:35.183 --> 31:37.674
Hey, I'll have you know
this is very important work.

31:37.752 --> 31:39.549
Rodeo clowns
save lives every day.

31:40.288 --> 31:41.220
They do?

31:41.289 --> 31:42.313
Sure.

31:42.524 --> 31:45.584
Now Val and Billy are gonna be
working closest to the bulls,

31:45.660 --> 31:48.026
but if one of them
should try to charge you...

31:48.196 --> 31:49.220
Charge us?

31:49.297 --> 31:50.924
Yeah. Well, just keep
sideways of them,

31:50.999 --> 31:52.990
otherwise they get their horns
underneath you.

31:53.068 --> 31:54.296
And they toss
and trample you.

31:54.369 --> 31:56.234
Toss and trample us?

31:56.705 --> 31:59.105
Don't worry,
you're gonna do just fine.

31:59.674 --> 32:02.507
Let me finish up your makeup
before I send you out to Elmo.

32:07.816 --> 32:09.545
<i>There weren't</i>
<i>very many Zillers</i>

32:09.617 --> 32:11.949
<i>registered at any</i>
<i>of the major hotels.</i>

32:12.020 --> 32:14.113
<i>Not any named Marcella,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

32:14.456 --> 32:16.287
<i>I was headed downtown</i>
<i>to the courthouse</i>

32:16.358 --> 32:18.223
<i>to check on her</i>
<i>Hawaii residence,</i>

32:18.393 --> 32:21.385
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>my little voice was also telling me</i>

32:21.830 --> 32:23.798
<i>I was headed on</i>
<i>a wild goose chase.</i>

32:46.654 --> 32:48.645
Lookout Elmo!
The bull's loose!

32:54.229 --> 32:55.253
Come on!

33:00.702 --> 33:02.033
Come here, bull!
Come here!

33:07.776 --> 33:09.368
Save yourself,
pardner.

33:09.444 --> 33:10.672
Hang in there, Elmo.

33:12.781 --> 33:14.840
Over here! Help!

33:16.418 --> 33:17.749
Come here!

33:26.761 --> 33:29.252
<i>Welcome to Bronco Elmo's</i>
<i>Authentic Rodeo</i>

33:29.330 --> 33:30.592
<i>and Wild West Show.</i>

33:30.665 --> 33:32.155
<i>Elmo won't be with us tonight,</i>

33:32.233 --> 33:35.669
<i>but carrying the spirit is his daughter,</i>
<i>Miss Lexi Ziller.</i>

33:36.905 --> 33:40.238
<i>Let's hear a big Hawaiian</i>
<i>welcome for Barbara Grey,</i>

33:40.308 --> 33:42.970
<i>worid-famous trick rider</i>
<i>out of Texas.</i>

33:43.044 --> 33:45.911
<i>Three years state champ,</i>
<i>riding Big Willy.</i>

33:46.915 --> 33:48.439
<i>Nice riding, Babs.</i>

33:54.055 --> 33:55.249
He's a tough one.

33:55.323 --> 33:57.518
He should be, uh,
he should be fine in a day or so.

33:57.592 --> 33:59.651
I been stomped
worse than this

33:59.727 --> 34:01.752
and I ain't
boot-heeled up yet.

34:02.897 --> 34:04.023
Thank you, Doctor.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.100
<i>And now ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen...</i>

34:07.168 --> 34:08.226
Thank you, Doctor.

34:08.303 --> 34:09.998
<i>...welcome this year's</i>
<i>rodeo queen...</i>

34:10.071 --> 34:11.231
And thank you,
both of you.

34:11.306 --> 34:12.637
I'm beholden to you.

34:12.806 --> 34:14.069
Oh, it's okay, ma'am.

34:14.542 --> 34:16.533
No. You two
are truly heroes.

34:16.878 --> 34:18.344
Oh, shucks.

34:19.647 --> 34:23.242
Could I impose on you
gentlemen just one more favor?

34:24.385 --> 34:26.683
Could I, I mean...
Could I ask you

34:26.754 --> 34:28.722
to stay here tonight,
to protect Elmo?

34:37.130 --> 34:38.996
<i>That's Leland.</i>

34:39.900 --> 34:42.460
<i>Two horns of pure TNT.</i>

34:42.904 --> 34:45.634
<i>He's gotta beat 6.8 seconds.</i>

34:46.440 --> 34:47.772
<i>What a ride!</i>

34:58.686 --> 35:02.315
<i>There's Matthew Snyder bulldogging</i>
<i>his third calf of the night.</i>

35:02.390 --> 35:05.689
<i>He's gonna have to go real fast, folks,</i>
<i>to catch up with the champ.</i>

35:05.760 --> 35:07.591
<i>He just might make it.</i>

35:09.063 --> 35:11.054
<i>Here's last year's...</i>

35:12.700 --> 35:15.260
<i>Yes, sir, this man's hands</i>
<i>are faster than your eye.</i>

35:18.306 --> 35:19.500
What are you doing?

35:19.574 --> 35:22.134
What are you doing
sneaking up on me?

35:22.477 --> 35:23.466
Ahhh!

35:24.178 --> 35:25.338
Where is Higgins?

35:25.547 --> 35:27.674
I don't know.
I think he went back to the estate.

35:27.749 --> 35:30.809
Said he got tired of waiting
on you and this Marcella lady.

35:32.353 --> 35:33.547
What've you been doing, man?

35:33.621 --> 35:35.020
You missed
all the excitement.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.249
What excitement?

35:46.834 --> 35:48.096
I can't see anything.

35:48.636 --> 35:50.069
Get out of the way.

35:51.606 --> 35:52.971
<i>Here's Danny.</i>

35:53.041 --> 35:55.771
<i>Oops, he's having a little</i>
<i>trouble with that calf.</i>

35:55.877 --> 35:58.710
<i>Doesn't wanna go down.</i>
<i>Show them who's boss, Danny!</i>

35:59.414 --> 36:02.679
<i>There you go.</i>
<i>Eight seconds flat.</i>

36:02.817 --> 36:06.378
<i>Not bad for a bad start.</i>
<i>Now let's hear it for Danny.</i>

36:23.137 --> 36:25.697
<i>Look at old Billy Simpson</i>
<i>riding that bronco.</i>

36:25.773 --> 36:27.104
<i>Stay on there, Billy.</i>

36:27.175 --> 36:30.508
<i>Another couple of seconds and you</i>
<i>could have yourself a new record.</i>

36:49.831 --> 36:51.298
<i>There's Slimy Doggett</i>

36:51.366 --> 36:54.335
<i>trying to stay on like</i>
<i>Elmo Ziller's pride and joy.</i>

36:54.502 --> 36:56.060
<i>Ride on, Slimy!</i>

36:57.839 --> 36:58.965
What about Lexi?

36:59.307 --> 37:00.331
What about her?

37:00.408 --> 37:01.432
Where is she?

37:01.909 --> 37:03.604
I guess she's
in her trailer.

37:04.012 --> 37:06.446
Man, what have you
been doing all this time?

37:07.281 --> 37:08.646
Do you smell something?

37:09.183 --> 37:10.878
Well, of course
I smell something.

37:10.952 --> 37:12.385
We're at a rodeo.

37:12.453 --> 37:14.512
Sittin' in this
dumb horse stall.

37:14.589 --> 37:15.920
Propane.

37:16.624 --> 37:17.784
The trailer.

37:19.327 --> 37:20.760
I'll turn off
the tanks.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.699
Elmo! Elmo, wake up.

37:30.505 --> 37:31.995
Elmo, wake up.

37:32.473 --> 37:34.441
Sgt. Maj. Higgins!
Snap to!

37:35.176 --> 37:37.644
What the bloody blazes
is going on?

37:38.780 --> 37:39.747
Come on.

37:46.487 --> 37:48.455
I knew it!
You are Higgins.

37:50.258 --> 37:51.953
I'm Elmo Ziller

37:52.527 --> 37:56.088
and I poke
from Hondo, Texas.

38:02.385 --> 38:03.852
Why didn't you tell me?

38:03.910 --> 38:05.866
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

38:05.934 --> 38:07.591
I didn't think you'd
approve of what I'm doing.

38:07.616 --> 38:10.175
You're right!
What are you doing?

38:10.200 --> 38:12.005
Look here, Magnum,
I'm the one who should be angry.

38:12.079 --> 38:13.740
But as you can see,
I'm perfectly calm.

38:13.814 --> 38:16.009
You? Why should
you be angry?

38:16.150 --> 38:18.277
Because you failed,
damn it.

38:18.352 --> 38:19.876
You had the fiends
within your grasp

38:19.954 --> 38:21.581
and allowed them
to slip away.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.554
A wretched display of
tactics and command.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.559
Not to mention
an abysmal failure

38:26.627 --> 38:29.221
to perform even rudimentary
detective procedures,

38:29.296 --> 38:31.730
like finding one
loud coarse woman.

38:31.799 --> 38:33.198
That's funny, and all the time

38:33.267 --> 38:34.757
I thought I was
saving your life.

38:34.835 --> 38:35.802
Stop it!

38:37.938 --> 38:39.929
Please,
Uncle Jonathan, Thomas.

38:41.175 --> 38:42.369
I'm sorry, child.

38:42.443 --> 38:44.274
We do seem to be losing
sight of the point.

38:44.345 --> 38:45.642
Now that you...

38:46.313 --> 38:47.541
Now that you've
brought it up,

38:47.615 --> 38:50.948
what exactly is the point,
or is that a secret, too?

38:53.521 --> 38:54.954
Elmo's dead,
isn't he?

38:56.423 --> 38:57.412
Yes.

38:57.491 --> 38:58.549
No!

38:59.160 --> 39:01.754
Texas state troopers found
his pickup burned and gutted

39:01.829 --> 39:03.558
just outside Hondo.

39:03.631 --> 39:05.155
But there was no body.

39:05.332 --> 39:07.163
It seems
Elmo dragged himself

39:07.234 --> 39:09.293
into the desert
with a broken leg.

39:09.370 --> 39:10.564
Extraordinary.

39:11.105 --> 39:13.733
Of course I suppose
Father's blood would win out

39:13.807 --> 39:14.899
in a situation like that.

39:14.975 --> 39:16.806
So he disappeared
in the desert?

39:17.344 --> 39:19.812
They tracked him as far
as the Mexican border.

39:20.447 --> 39:22.312
Then it was up to
the <i>Federales.</i>

39:23.417 --> 39:24.645
They didn't find him,

39:25.319 --> 39:27.310
but they really
didn't look, either.

39:28.389 --> 39:30.152
He's alive. I know it.

39:31.859 --> 39:35.090
Holed up somewhere south of
the border till he can heal.

39:35.729 --> 39:37.424
I suppose he could be alive.

39:38.199 --> 39:39.894
He's got enough
meanness in him.

39:40.467 --> 39:42.196
It's called grit
in Texas.

39:43.170 --> 39:44.159
He's alive.

39:44.638 --> 39:46.037
So until he shows up...

39:46.307 --> 39:49.799
I gotta keep Marcella's grubby
little hands off the rodeo.

39:49.877 --> 39:51.845
I figure the best way
to do that is to

39:52.479 --> 39:53.969
prove she tried
to kill him.

39:54.048 --> 39:55.538
The rodeo means
that much to you?

39:55.716 --> 39:57.183
It does to Daddy.

39:58.886 --> 40:00.353
He means everything to me.

40:02.022 --> 40:03.182
Well,

40:03.424 --> 40:05.756
there's only one way
to force Marcella's hand.

40:08.395 --> 40:10.761
So we just try again,
that's all.

40:11.198 --> 40:14.292
Oh, goody.
I can't wait to see

40:14.368 --> 40:16.199
how you're gonna
screw it up this time.

40:16.270 --> 40:19.364
Well, ma'am, you gave us
round-trip tickets and that's all.

40:19.773 --> 40:22.003
We could just go on home
and take the loss.

40:24.411 --> 40:27.710
I have given you
$10,000.

40:28.082 --> 40:29.379
On paper.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.410
When I sell
the show.

40:33.053 --> 40:35.988
Well, it seems to me
you don't got the show yet.

40:37.024 --> 40:38.958
Thanks to you bozos.

40:41.028 --> 40:42.461
$20,000.

40:45.065 --> 40:45.997
What?

40:46.066 --> 40:49.126
We want $20,000,
or we go home.

40:49.703 --> 40:51.295
I don't even
like this place.

40:52.473 --> 40:53.735
You heard the man.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.470
Just get it right
this time, okay?

41:06.487 --> 41:07.579
Hey,

41:08.255 --> 41:10.780
there might just be
hope for you yet, son.

41:15.329 --> 41:17.229
Just tell me one thing,
will you?

41:17.464 --> 41:19.728
How did you get on
that bucking horse?

41:21.902 --> 41:23.301
Oh, dear fellow.

41:23.637 --> 41:27.437
Those polo games in India were
bloody hell compared to this.

41:47.061 --> 41:50.155
Hey, Bud, when and how
we gonna pull this thing off?

41:50.531 --> 41:51.964
We ain't.
Huh?

41:52.666 --> 41:54.156
Not now, anyways.

41:54.234 --> 41:56.225
Not here.
Too many people.

41:56.570 --> 41:58.037
When are we
gonna do it?

41:59.206 --> 42:01.071
We're gonna grab him
before the show.

42:01.308 --> 42:03.071
This time,
I got a plan.

42:03.410 --> 42:04.809
Oh, this I gotta hear.

42:05.245 --> 42:06.269
Oh, yeah?

42:07.247 --> 42:09.613
You know that little
cowgirl you been sparking?

42:11.452 --> 42:12.612
What about her?

42:20.194 --> 42:21.661
Higg...
I mean, Bronco.

42:21.729 --> 42:23.526
Come on.
You're gonna be late for the show.

42:23.597 --> 42:26.191
Dear fellow,
your protective instinct is touching,

42:26.433 --> 42:28.094
but this strategy won't work.

42:28.168 --> 42:31.001
What's the matter? All I'm supposed
to do is walk you to the arena.

42:31.071 --> 42:32.060
Thomas and T. C...

42:32.139 --> 42:34.266
My point is that those
blackguards won't try to kill me

42:34.341 --> 42:36.036
with you hovering about.

42:36.143 --> 42:37.440
You must be invisible.

42:38.112 --> 42:40.672
In other words,
keep your distance, Rick.

42:41.448 --> 42:42.437
Okay.

42:43.984 --> 42:44.973
Done.

42:48.589 --> 42:50.056
Now, buckaroo,

42:51.158 --> 42:52.682
let Bronco ride!

43:08.142 --> 43:09.074
Hey.

43:09.910 --> 43:11.502
You're new here,
ain't you?

43:12.513 --> 43:13.445
Yep.

43:13.781 --> 43:15.874
I just love a man
in a uniform.

43:16.016 --> 43:17.005
No kidding.

43:17.084 --> 43:19.018
How'd you know
I was in the service?

43:19.586 --> 43:21.577
No. I mean this uniform.

43:48.549 --> 43:49.675
Where's Higgins?

43:49.750 --> 43:51.342
I thought he was
with you. L...

43:52.453 --> 43:54.114
They must've grabbed him
in the stalls.

43:54.188 --> 43:55.348
Check the chutes.

43:56.223 --> 43:58.248
T.C., watch the ring.

44:06.300 --> 44:08.131
Give me a hand.

44:32.159 --> 44:34.093
He's following us
on a horse.

44:34.561 --> 44:35.585
Darn it.

44:49.843 --> 44:51.538
This is all quite ridiculous,
you know.

44:51.612 --> 44:53.546
I am obviously
not Bronco Elmo.

44:53.614 --> 44:54.808
Aw, shut up!

44:55.215 --> 44:56.648
The police
know everything.

44:56.717 --> 44:58.378
Even now, they're in
hot pursuit.

44:58.452 --> 45:01.148
Immediate surrender is your
only rational alternative.

45:24.511 --> 45:26.001
What is
that thing?

45:27.748 --> 45:30.239
Get that thing
out of the way!

45:30.951 --> 45:32.851
We're going over the curb.
Hold on!

45:44.464 --> 45:47.399
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?

45:55.976 --> 45:57.170
Hold it right there!

46:10.891 --> 46:12.290
Really, Magnum,

46:13.260 --> 46:14.591
when will you learn?

46:15.162 --> 46:18.495
It's,
"Reach for the sky, hombre."

46:22.903 --> 46:25.371
<i>It was just like</i>
<i>the Saturday double features</i>

46:25.439 --> 46:27.236
<i>I used to spend</i>
<i>my allowance on.</i>

46:27.708 --> 46:29.266
<i>The bad guys confessed.</i>

46:29.343 --> 46:31.743
<i>The evil stepmother</i>
<i>went to jail with them</i>

46:31.812 --> 46:34.508
<i>and the ranch,</i>
<i>or the rodeo, was saved.</i>

46:35.248 --> 46:36.943
<i>The only thing left</i>
<i>was goodbye.</i>

46:37.784 --> 46:39.046
<i>Only this time,</i>

46:39.419 --> 46:41.683
<i>it was the girl</i>
<i>riding into the sunset.</i>

46:42.856 --> 46:44.323
Where's the rodeo off to now?

46:44.391 --> 46:46.621
Texas. Season's over
till spring.

46:47.094 --> 46:48.061
And you?

46:48.328 --> 46:49.352
Mexico.

46:49.696 --> 46:51.960
Daddy's down there somewhere
and I'm gonna find him.

46:52.032 --> 46:53.659
That's the old
Higgins spirit.

46:53.867 --> 46:55.892
Oh, Uncle Jonathan,
I love you dearly

46:56.269 --> 46:59.261
and I'll always be grateful for
what you did for Daddy and me.

47:07.648 --> 47:09.639
Thanks doesn't
really say it, does it?

47:09.716 --> 47:11.115
It says a whole lot.

47:11.518 --> 47:12.678
And this, too.

47:17.658 --> 47:20.354
I don't suppose you ever get to Texas,
do you?

47:21.328 --> 47:23.796
But the rodeo always comes back to town,
doesn't it?

47:24.097 --> 47:26.565
Next season, cowboy.
That's a promise.

47:27.534 --> 47:29.900
And look after
Uncle Jonathan.

47:30.804 --> 47:32.465
He really put his
life in your hands,

47:32.539 --> 47:34.268
counting on you
to trap the killer.

47:34.341 --> 47:35.399
You bet.

47:38.378 --> 47:39.402
Take care.

47:49.189 --> 47:50.781
A brave and
resourceful girl.

47:51.358 --> 47:52.655
I shall miss her.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.120
You know, Higgins,

47:55.762 --> 47:57.354
I want to thank you,
too.

47:57.798 --> 47:58.890
Whatever for?

47:59.166 --> 48:01.259
For trusting me
with your life that way.

48:01.368 --> 48:04.428
Putting your faith in my skill and
ability as a private investigator.

48:04.504 --> 48:05.562
It's very important to me,

48:05.639 --> 48:07.869
knowing you think
I'm really a professional.

48:08.108 --> 48:09.302
Professional?

48:10.744 --> 48:11.768
Really, Magnum?

48:12.179 --> 48:15.774
I did it because you have more
dumb luck than anyone I know.
