<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>And here's what's</i>

00:01.407 --> 00:02.377
<i>been going on</i>
<i>in my life lately.</i>

00:03.526 --> 00:04.630
This is a not

00:04.667 --> 00:05.670
a real attack, is it?

00:05.704 --> 00:06.873
No, this is our competition.

00:06.908 --> 00:08.981
Verbanski Corp took all
of our clients.

00:09.015 --> 00:10.419
Told you.
You put me out there,

00:10.453 --> 00:11.656
you don't have
to worry

00:11.692 --> 00:12.827
about what other
companies are doing.

00:12.861 --> 00:13.728
Morgan needs a handler.

00:13.762 --> 00:14.562
What? Who, me?

00:14.597 --> 00:17.138
You be my handler. Yeah!

00:17.173 --> 00:18.745
Just because you have
the Intersect in you

00:18.779 --> 00:20.513
doesn't mean you don't have
something to learn still!

00:20.547 --> 00:21.914
I have something
I can offer you

00:21.949 --> 00:23.049
no one else can.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.896 --> 00:36.896
Okay, target acquired.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.432
Distance to intercept:
100 meters.

00:39.466 --> 00:41.834
This is it. You ready, Casey?

00:41.869 --> 00:44.837
Readiness-- like life--

00:44.855 --> 00:46.439
begins at the point
of conception.

00:46.473 --> 00:47.807
Where am I headed?

00:47.841 --> 00:49.776
Other side of the street.
You should be hitting a one-way.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.878
Head south
to initiate intercept.

00:51.912 --> 00:53.312
Roger that.

00:53.347 --> 00:55.548
You okay? Your blood pressure
just went through the roof.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.551
I'm fine.

00:58.585 --> 00:59.685
How much time till intercept?

00:59.720 --> 01:02.038
Steady. In five,

01:02.072 --> 01:03.923
four, three,

01:03.957 --> 01:05.958
two, one.

01:07.077 --> 01:08.411
John!

01:08.462 --> 01:10.079
Gertrude, hey.

01:10.130 --> 01:12.365
What are the chances?

01:12.399 --> 01:13.533
Her favorite restaurant is

01:13.567 --> 01:16.886
a block away,
a raw bar called Cerulean.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.106
I was just, uh,
going around the corner

01:20.140 --> 01:21.441
to that little oyster bar.

01:21.475 --> 01:24.811
Cerulean-- that... that is
my favorite restaurant.

01:24.845 --> 01:26.112
What are the chances?

01:27.147 --> 01:28.581
Wow!

01:28.615 --> 01:30.283
You know, I could really go

01:30.317 --> 01:32.051
for some Blue Points
right about now.

01:32.069 --> 01:34.120
Did you hear that?

01:34.154 --> 01:35.238
The target is yours.
Ask her out.

01:35.272 --> 01:36.856
She practically
just asked you out.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.658
Blue Points are delicious.

01:38.692 --> 01:40.993
Especially with a little
mignonette sauce.

01:41.028 --> 01:43.062
Boy, that's
the best thing

01:43.097 --> 01:45.131
the damn French ever gave us.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.501
Come on, Casey.

01:49.937 --> 01:53.773
Well, it was great
talking to you.

01:53.807 --> 01:56.309
No, wait! Just give a kiss
on the cheek.

01:56.343 --> 01:58.511
Just let her know you're
available and interested!

01:59.980 --> 02:01.347
I guess I'll, uh,

02:01.381 --> 02:02.765
see you around?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.433
Come on!

02:04.468 --> 02:05.852
Yes...

02:12.392 --> 02:13.726
So you froze up.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.862
It happens
to the best of us.

02:15.896 --> 02:17.597
No, I didn't freeze.

02:17.631 --> 02:18.931
Then what do
you call that?

02:18.966 --> 02:20.032
Reconnaissance.

02:20.067 --> 02:22.318
Wait. You planted a bug
on Verbanski?

02:22.369 --> 02:25.872
Mm-hmm. Piggybacks off
her cell phone's Wi-Fi.

02:25.906 --> 02:27.473
That's a weird
move, Casey.

02:27.508 --> 02:29.575
This way I can find out
everything I need to

02:29.610 --> 02:31.077
before I ask her out.

02:31.111 --> 02:33.379
I'm pretty sure that's why
people go on dates,

02:33.413 --> 02:35.581
to get to know one another.
Just do me a favor,

02:35.616 --> 02:37.316
don't tell Chuck
and Morgan about it.

02:37.351 --> 02:38.551
Lips are sealed.

02:41.839 --> 02:46.342
How many triple words are
you gonna leave open, Jeff?

02:46.393 --> 02:47.960
My God, he's dumb.

02:47.995 --> 02:48.828
Morgan...

02:48.862 --> 02:50.029
Boom! 87 points, huh?!

02:50.063 --> 02:51.597
It's good to be
the Intersect.

02:51.632 --> 02:53.132
Please, buddy,
we're on a mission.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.967
Oh, right. Sorry.

02:55.002 --> 02:57.370
I thought we were just sitting
in some Burbank parking garage.

02:57.404 --> 02:59.906
Oh, I'm sorry, you got
somewhere you need to be?

02:59.940 --> 03:01.674
I have a hot date.
No biggie.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.042
If this is how you choose

03:03.076 --> 03:04.851
to use the world's greatest
super-computer. Well...

03:04.852 --> 03:08.418
Okay, okay, this is
actually what I needed

03:08.949 --> 03:10.049
Hmm?
to talk to you about.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.118
Um, the attitude.

03:12.152 --> 03:14.020
Am I not the world's
greatest...?

03:14.054 --> 03:15.688
Being the Intersect doesn't mean
you have to constantly talk

03:15.722 --> 03:16.856
about being the Intersect.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.192
You did it your way,
I'll do it my way.

03:19.226 --> 03:21.761
- Morgan!
- Chuck!

03:21.795 --> 03:23.296
I hate to say it, buddy,

03:23.330 --> 03:24.830
but you're starting
to remind me

03:24.865 --> 03:26.499
of seventh-grade Morgan,
and I think

03:26.533 --> 03:28.334
we both know
what happened to him.

03:31.605 --> 03:33.139
Stay here.

03:35.576 --> 03:36.609
Got it, boss.

03:42.149 --> 03:44.183
It's good to see you again.

03:44.218 --> 03:46.252
I trust you
and your team are well?

03:46.286 --> 03:47.853
Hanging in there, yeah.

03:47.888 --> 03:50.556
Turns out working in
the private sector is...

03:50.591 --> 03:52.892
Look, I think it's better
if we keep this brief.

03:52.926 --> 03:54.927
No offense.

03:54.962 --> 03:57.463
You've heard of Mats Zorn?

03:57.497 --> 03:59.398
Yeah, rich guy with
the whistleblower Web site?

03:59.433 --> 04:02.134
Makes WikiLeaks look like
child's play.

04:02.169 --> 04:04.370
A number of classified
CIA memos have fallen

04:04.388 --> 04:05.805
into Zorn's hands.

04:05.839 --> 04:07.540
So, you want us to grab Zorn?

04:07.574 --> 04:09.141
And the documents.

04:09.176 --> 04:10.543
The drive contains
his itinerary.

04:10.577 --> 04:12.144
Zorn doesn't stay
in one place

04:12.179 --> 04:13.646
any longer than
it takes refuel,

04:13.680 --> 04:15.114
but we have him
passing through L.A.

04:15.148 --> 04:16.882
This is a paying gig, right?

04:16.916 --> 04:18.985
There's a sizeable
bounty on Zorn.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.920
I'm outsourcing to your team
to circumvent the leak.

04:20.954 --> 04:23.723
My only condition is
that no one breathes my name

04:23.757 --> 04:24.724
in relation
to the mission.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.060
Yo, Becky!

04:28.095 --> 04:30.630
What up, baby girl?

04:30.664 --> 04:32.198
I told you to come alone.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.800
You doing Pilates, huh? You are,
don't say you're not. You are.

04:34.835 --> 04:36.669
What the hell is wrong with him?

04:36.703 --> 04:38.838
So many things.

04:38.872 --> 04:40.640
Becky, your core's really tight.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.181
Alex?

04:49.216 --> 04:50.182
Oh, hey.

04:50.217 --> 04:51.917
I thought you were Morgan.

04:51.952 --> 04:54.120
No, I just dropped
him off at the Buy More.

04:54.154 --> 04:55.221
What?

04:55.255 --> 04:57.456
Guess he forgot about our plans.

04:57.491 --> 04:58.624
I wouldn't say that.

04:58.659 --> 05:00.693
I mean, he did mention
having a hot date, so...

05:00.727 --> 05:04.297
Well, clearly it's
with someone else.

05:04.331 --> 05:06.799
Is there something going on
between you two?

05:06.833 --> 05:11.437
You would tell me if Morgan's
seeing someone else, right?

05:11.471 --> 05:16.108
Yes. And no, he is not.

05:16.143 --> 05:19.178
He's had a lot on his mind
lately, that's all.

05:19.212 --> 05:21.447
Let me track him down and talk
some sense into him, okay?

05:21.481 --> 05:23.449
Okay.

05:23.467 --> 05:24.317
Chin up.

05:24.351 --> 05:25.785
Thanks.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.659
Oh, hey. How'd it go
with the general?

05:33.694 --> 05:35.177
Piece of cake.

05:35.228 --> 05:37.730
Data drive with the mission's
locked up tight in Castle.

05:37.764 --> 05:39.799
- So what's the problem?
- Morgan.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.301
I tried to have
a heart-to-heart with him

05:42.336 --> 05:44.670
about his...
Overblown ego?

05:44.705 --> 05:46.038
Anyway, he went AWOL.

05:46.073 --> 05:48.641
Casey, can you can help
with a surveillance detail?

05:50.744 --> 05:51.711
Casey, what you looking at?

05:51.745 --> 05:52.845
Nothing.
None of your business.

05:52.879 --> 05:54.980
Ooh, you got a wire up on
someone, huh?

05:55.015 --> 05:56.282
Who is it?

05:56.316 --> 05:57.550
Verbanski.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.318
Corporate espionage.
He's just sizing up

05:59.353 --> 06:00.686
the competition,
that's all.

06:00.721 --> 06:01.987
Perving out on Gertrude.

06:02.022 --> 06:03.389
Weird move, Casey.

06:03.423 --> 06:04.657
I told you.

06:04.691 --> 06:07.860
So, have you
considered my offer?

06:07.894 --> 06:09.661
Gertrude, do me a favor.

06:09.679 --> 06:11.997
What is he doing
in her office?

06:12.015 --> 06:13.599
That's a good question.

06:13.633 --> 06:16.385
Next time you make me an offer
like that to me,

06:16.436 --> 06:18.837
why don't you go ahead and spit
in my face instead?

06:18.855 --> 06:19.872
Thank you, Morgan.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.558

06:22.609 --> 06:26.512
I offer you the services

the decency,

Well, why didn't
you wake me?

07:50.862 --> 07:53.413

did hurt you.

I'm just angry.

You know, the Intersect
is an integral part

08:02.840 --> 08:05.142
of our business,
and Morgan just sold it

08:05.176 --> 08:07.244
to our number-one rival.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.847
Morgan is also
your best friend.

08:10.882 --> 08:13.683
I'm trying not to think
about that right now.

08:16.220 --> 08:17.854
Okay, her bottle is

Oh, that's my girl.

10:05.796 --> 10:07.464
And it's cool because
Cruise wears them.

10:07.498 --> 10:10.000
What is...
what is going on with you?

10:10.034 --> 10:11.468
You smell like
the Glendale Galleria.

10:11.502 --> 10:13.603
It's Ed Hardy.
I'll send you a bottle.

10:15.139 --> 10:19.276
- What is this?
- My three-week notice.

10:19.310 --> 10:20.911
What?! You backdated it
three weeks.

10:20.945 --> 10:22.429
Oh, yeah? Well,
I been busy, Chuck.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.447
Working for
Verbanski Corp?

10:24.482 --> 10:26.733
Ah, you heard.
Monster deal.

10:26.767 --> 10:28.451
I was gonna tell you
when the ink was dry.

10:28.486 --> 10:30.253
No, no, no, no, I get it,
I get it-- you're busy.

10:30.288 --> 10:31.821
God, I knew it-- I knew you
were gonna do this, man!

10:31.856 --> 10:32.906
Do what?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.491
You know, just take
this whole thing

10:34.525 --> 10:35.825
and make it all personal.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.911
Personal? Personal?
How is this personal?

10:37.945 --> 10:41.164
Do you understand?!
Our business needs you.

10:41.198 --> 10:43.232
We need the Intersect!

10:43.251 --> 10:44.801
Carmichael Industries is

10:44.835 --> 10:47.504
just starting to get off
the ground right now.

10:47.538 --> 10:50.073
Yeah. Yeah, well,

10:50.091 --> 10:52.241
I just came for some
stuff out of my office.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.593
I would have sent
my decorator,

10:53.628 --> 10:55.078
but she's all busy
with Mark Wahlberg's place.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.913
Hollywood...

10:56.931 --> 10:58.348
Think it
through, moron.

10:58.382 --> 11:01.785
You walk out on us,
you never walk back.

11:01.819 --> 11:03.520
Please, save it,
all right, everybody?

11:03.554 --> 11:05.305
You had the greatest weapon
on the planet

11:05.356 --> 11:06.823
and you chose
not to use me.

11:06.857 --> 11:08.257
That's on you.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.477
So you went and told Verbanski
about the Intersect?

11:10.528 --> 11:11.945
Morgan, we were just trying
to protect you, that's all.

11:11.979 --> 11:12.946
Don't do this.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.315
It's already done, okay, Chuck?

11:15.366 --> 11:17.100
It's too late. I don't need

11:17.134 --> 11:18.785
any of this crap.

11:18.819 --> 11:20.987
Uh-uh-uh-uh. You sure you
want to do that, Johnny?

11:23.457 --> 11:25.125
Fine. Leave.

11:25.159 --> 11:27.611
But there's no way I'm letting
a traitor date my daughter.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.462
Right, right, right.

11:29.497 --> 11:30.997
Your daughter,
your daughter, sure.

11:31.048 --> 11:32.999
Excuse me. I'll take care
of that right now.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.801
Sweet little Allie...

11:34.802 --> 11:35.688
Alex!

11:35.713 --> 11:37.013
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
sure, whatever.

11:37.254 --> 11:38.888
There you go.

11:38.923 --> 11:40.674
All right?

11:40.725 --> 11:43.259
You text message break up
with my little girl?

11:43.293 --> 11:46.479
Yeah, well, I can do better.

11:47.631 --> 11:51.167
- You...!
- Just let him go.

11:51.202 --> 11:52.502
What do you
want me to do?

11:52.536 --> 11:53.653
You want me to kill him?
'Cause I'll kill him.

11:53.688 --> 11:54.938
Better yet,
let's keep him alive.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.833
You can work him over
for a while. Yeah.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.973
No, Dad, I don't want you
to hurt Morgan.

11:59.977 --> 12:01.745
I love him. I just...

12:01.779 --> 12:04.848
I just don't understand how
he could be so awful, you know?

12:04.882 --> 12:07.483
Just tell me what to do.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.919
He just...

12:09.954 --> 12:11.421
I just don't understand.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.390
I just want

12:13.424 --> 12:15.792
the old Morgan back,
you know?

12:16.794 --> 12:18.662
I know it hurts, honey.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.497
We Caseys-- we don't
like to open up,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.666
make ourselves vulnerable.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.334
'Cause when someone
does rip our heart out

12:24.368 --> 12:26.536
and stomp on it right
in front of our eyes,

12:26.570 --> 12:29.939
it could be like
the worst torture of all.

12:29.974 --> 12:34.561
I just want you to know
that I'm always here for you.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.196
Always will be.

12:38.566 --> 12:40.884
<i>Charity Hospital</i> will return
after these messages.

12:40.918 --> 12:43.887
Hello, friends.
Sorry if I'm interrupting,

12:43.888 --> 12:45.711
but we have something
important to discuss...

12:45.736 --> 12:47.236
Who's that handsome devil?

12:47.258 --> 12:49.125
If you're in a pickle,
why not on come down

12:49.160 --> 12:50.377
to your neighborhood Buy More,

12:50.411 --> 12:52.245
where a green shirt
can help you find your way.

12:52.296 --> 12:54.631
You know, he's right.

12:54.665 --> 12:56.066
We should head to the Buy More.

12:56.100 --> 13:00.220
That backup juicer's probably
on its last leg.

13:00.254 --> 13:02.505
Yeah, that should
kill a couple hours.

13:02.539 --> 13:05.709
Just got to make it
to dinner, right?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.543
Something is wrong
with Morgan.

13:07.561 --> 13:09.012
This isn't like him.

13:09.046 --> 13:10.430
Oh, sure it is.

13:10.481 --> 13:13.382
His new powers-- they pushed
him to the Dark Side.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.218
He doesn't have
a dark side.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.088
It's like middle school
all over again.

13:19.256 --> 13:22.058
Like when Morgan grew
his first mustache--

13:22.076 --> 13:23.993
full, thick, manly.

13:24.028 --> 13:26.162
Like a miniature Tom Selleck.

13:26.197 --> 13:28.064
Thought he was
cock of the walk.

13:28.082 --> 13:30.800
Cool, sarcastic, mean.

13:30.835 --> 13:33.253
Made our lives a living hell
for a few weeks.

13:33.287 --> 13:35.288
That is, until Meredith Lester
showed up.

13:35.339 --> 13:38.742
And she grew a mustache, too?

13:39.744 --> 13:41.678
No, she did not, no.

13:41.712 --> 13:44.891
One day in gym class, Meredith
snuck up behind Morgan

13:44.892 --> 13:46.516
and pantsed him
in front of everyone.

13:46.517 --> 13:48.284
Exposed him
for who he really was.

13:48.319 --> 13:50.587
We went back to being
uncool by fifth period.

13:50.621 --> 13:54.157
And we went back to being
friends by the end of the day.

13:54.191 --> 13:55.475
That's it!

13:55.526 --> 13:57.727
You're going to drop
Morgan's pants?

13:57.762 --> 13:59.329
Metaphorically, yes.

13:59.363 --> 14:01.281
We finish Beckman's mission,

14:01.315 --> 14:02.482
we show Verbanski that Morgan's

14:02.533 --> 14:04.451
not as cool
as he thinks he is, and...

14:04.485 --> 14:06.436
And you'll be best friends
by the end of the day?

14:06.470 --> 14:07.954
Exactly.

14:11.842 --> 14:14.544
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:14.578 --> 14:15.678
What, what is it?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.681
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

14:18.716 --> 14:20.550
Ed Hardy cologne.

14:22.136 --> 14:24.053
It's gone. The zip drive's gone.

14:24.088 --> 14:27.623
The little bearded bastard
stole it. He stole our mission.

14:27.624 --> 14:29.596
He probably took it with him
to Verbanski Corp.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.828
I can't believe...

14:32.518 --> 14:34.786
Morgan just pantsed us!

14:37.723 --> 14:38.790
What are you two doing?

14:38.825 --> 14:41.059
We're taking down
our competition.

15:00.529 --> 15:03.848
Anybody work here anymore?

15:12.675 --> 15:16.911
Don't worry, Clara, I'm going to
find someone to look after you.

15:16.946 --> 15:19.531
Lester, come here.

15:19.582 --> 15:22.500
Guard this child
with your life.

15:22.535 --> 15:24.652
The Chosen One.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.955
Hey...

15:31.761 --> 15:33.378
Come on,
I got you, man.

15:33.429 --> 15:35.096
Hey, what's the big idea?

15:35.131 --> 15:36.297
Get up, Jeff.

15:36.331 --> 15:37.515
Use your legs.

15:37.550 --> 15:40.035
I am going to take
a knife and fork

15:40.069 --> 15:41.236
and just eat those
chubby little cheeks.

15:41.237 --> 15:43.071
Yes, Uncle Lester...

15:43.138 --> 15:44.906
What are you doing, man?
You're scaring her.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.174
No.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.191
Okay? And what are you doing?

15:47.242 --> 15:48.476
Are you trying to kill yourself?

15:48.494 --> 15:50.311
I'm just taking off
the exhaust pipe,

15:50.346 --> 15:52.046
trying to squeeze

15:52.081 --> 15:53.915
a few more horses
out of the beast.

15:53.949 --> 15:55.833
Ever hear of carbon monoxide,
hmm, guys?

15:55.868 --> 15:56.979
Can't leave your engine running.

15:57.004 --> 15:58.304
No, he has to leave
the engine running

15:58.320 --> 15:59.754
or he can't start it up again.

15:59.788 --> 16:02.557
And the engine noise
helps me sleep.

16:02.591 --> 16:04.959
Hold up. Are you telling me
that you sleep in your van

16:04.993 --> 16:06.060
with the engine running?

16:06.095 --> 16:09.197
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

16:09.231 --> 16:11.849
Jeff, you need to see
a doctor, man.

16:11.884 --> 16:13.101
I'm worried you might

16:13.135 --> 16:14.335
have damaged your brain.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.637
No, Jeffrey doesn't have
a brain, silly-pants.

16:16.672 --> 16:18.523
Listen, just give me a call--
I'll give you a quick consult.

16:18.557 --> 16:21.242
- Really?
- Caught me on a slow week.

16:21.276 --> 16:24.212
Okay, Clara, let's go, honey.

16:24.246 --> 16:26.230
- No, five more minutes.
- Come on, Clara. Thanks, though.

16:26.281 --> 16:27.915
Five more minutes.

16:27.950 --> 16:29.400
Come on... yeah.
Thank you.

16:29.451 --> 16:33.388
My biological clock
is tick-tocking.

16:55.811 --> 16:58.262
You realize this is
breaking and entering.

16:58.313 --> 17:00.481
Verbanski can shoot
us all with impunity.

17:00.516 --> 17:02.400
Well, her little goon
Grimes stole our mission.

17:02.434 --> 17:03.918
We're going to
steal it back.

17:03.952 --> 17:06.720
So this has nothing to do with revenge
against Gertrude and Morgan?

17:06.738 --> 17:07.954
Absolutely not.

17:07.990 --> 17:09.589
If we don't get
the bounty on Zorn,

17:09.625 --> 17:10.992
Carmichael Industries
goes belly up.

17:11.026 --> 17:12.993
And if we don't stop Zorn
from posting those files,

17:13.028 --> 17:14.996
no telling how many agents
are going to get burned.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.497
Fine. Where are we going?

17:16.531 --> 17:19.416
The zip drive's in
your girlfriend's office, Casey.

17:19.451 --> 17:20.619
The only problem is
getting through the door.

17:20.645 --> 17:21.845
Roger that.

17:22.104 --> 17:24.755
I can infiltrate.
You two take down security.

17:30.629 --> 17:32.763
You sure that's a good idea?

17:32.798 --> 17:36.184
Well, I mean, you know,
you and Verbanski.

17:36.218 --> 17:37.919
There is no me and Verbanski.

17:37.953 --> 17:40.922
Coming from the guy who put
a surveillance bug on her.

17:40.956 --> 17:42.473
That was before she
poached one of my team.

17:42.524 --> 17:43.608
That woman is dead to me.

17:43.642 --> 17:46.310
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

17:48.113 --> 17:49.931
Come on, let's grab
their uniforms.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.008
Casey, Verbanski's office
is on your right.

18:01.043 --> 18:02.210
Don't touch the handle.

18:05.013 --> 18:06.130
What's the holdup?

18:06.165 --> 18:07.548
Just accessing the system.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.250
Okay, go.

18:27.002 --> 18:28.186
Ah...

18:33.175 --> 18:35.076
<i>What is he doing?</i>

18:35.110 --> 18:36.644
I have no idea.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.616
Casey, we are on a bit
of a schedule here.

18:43.986 --> 18:47.455
Casey, is everything
okay in there?

18:47.489 --> 18:50.675
Yeah, A-OK.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.477
Casey, you've got incoming.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.713
Bingo.

19:14.082 --> 19:16.534
Let's start with
the Zorn mission briefing.

19:20.155 --> 19:21.122
Scotty, what is this?

19:21.156 --> 19:22.540
A tall soy latte
with two Splendas.

19:22.574 --> 19:24.158
Soy? Who said anything
about soy?

19:24.192 --> 19:26.627
What do you want me to do,
start lactating for you?

19:26.662 --> 19:28.596
I'm not sure what you mean.

19:28.630 --> 19:31.732
I asked for almond milk.
Al-mond milk.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.902
You megalomaniacal
little bastard.

19:34.937 --> 19:36.537
Okay? Please fix it.

19:36.555 --> 19:37.555
Yes, sir.

19:37.589 --> 19:39.307
This is the best
Harvard has to offer?

19:42.678 --> 19:43.945
Casey, watch out,
it's Verbanski.

19:47.816 --> 19:49.567
Got it. Let's move.

19:53.438 --> 19:55.273
What's the matter?

19:58.026 --> 19:59.961
Nothing.

19:59.995 --> 20:01.395
Blue team, please report

20:01.430 --> 20:02.530

20:02.564 --> 20:03.898
Blue team to the
east training field.

20:03.932 --> 20:05.499
Okay, I got to boogie.
That's my class.

20:05.534 --> 20:08.669
Okay, I suppose our mission

21:33.121 --> 21:35.823
Verbanski wants me
to whip you into shape.

21:35.857 --> 21:38.175
I'll tell you what.
We're gonna play a little game.

21:38.210 --> 21:40.294
What we're going to do is, I'm
going to point to one of you

21:40.328 --> 21:41.345
and you're going to step up,

21:41.380 --> 21:42.830
using whatever technique
we choose.

21:42.864 --> 21:44.832
and try and take me down.

21:44.866 --> 21:46.384
You all seem so excited.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.401
Ah...

21:48.520 --> 21:50.855
You-- come here.

21:59.881 --> 22:02.083
Too slow.
You're just too slow.

22:02.117 --> 22:04.585
My software is just
way too fast for you.

22:04.619 --> 22:06.871
You, you, you.

22:24.256 --> 22:26.307
I'll take that.

22:35.767 --> 22:38.218
Yeah.

22:51.082 --> 22:53.667
Enough foreplay?

22:57.789 --> 22:59.790
Get over yourself,
Gertrude.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.188
I'd like you over here, you
and this guy over here, big guy.

23:14.222 --> 23:15.306
Oh!

23:32.541 --> 23:34.008
What are you
waiting for, princess?

23:35.310 --> 23:36.877
Come on.

23:36.912 --> 23:39.163
I'll be gentle.

23:40.282 --> 23:41.615
Ooh.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.638
Your master
has taught you well.

23:49.925 --> 23:51.058
I am the master.

23:51.092 --> 23:52.393
Chuck.

23:52.427 --> 23:53.794
What are you doing here?

23:53.812 --> 23:56.831
I'm here to take back what
you stole from us, buddy.

23:56.865 --> 23:57.932
No, no.

23:57.966 --> 23:59.400
The Intersect is mine.
The Intersect?

23:59.434 --> 24:00.684
I want the Zip drive, okay?

24:00.735 --> 24:02.135
You can keep the Intersect,
Gollum.

24:02.153 --> 24:04.371
Ever since you
started zooming,

24:04.406 --> 24:06.073
you're acting a little bit
big for your breeches.

24:06.107 --> 24:08.359
No, my breeches fit just fine,
thank you very much.

24:08.410 --> 24:09.476
You're just jealous.

24:09.494 --> 24:11.161
Oh, oh, oh? Jealous?

24:11.196 --> 24:14.014
Right, jealous that I was
a better spy than you ever were.

24:14.049 --> 24:16.333
That I take the Intersect
to a whole new level, man.

24:16.368 --> 24:17.585
You know what, Morgan?
We're friends,

24:17.619 --> 24:18.886
so I'm going to give you
a chance here.

24:18.920 --> 24:19.920
No, that's the thing, Chuck.

24:20.956 --> 24:22.339
We are not friends.

24:31.998 --> 24:33.629
I can't believe
you just said that.

24:35.472 --> 24:37.172
Yeah, well,
things come out sometimes

24:37.207 --> 24:38.807
in the heat of the...

24:39.843 --> 24:41.243
No. No, forget that.

24:41.261 --> 24:42.444
I stand by it.

24:42.479 --> 24:44.680
We are not friends.

24:44.714 --> 24:46.298
We got the drive.

24:46.349 --> 24:48.417
Okay, Chuck, come on.
Let's get out of here.

24:48.451 --> 24:50.169
Grimes, there's been a breach.

24:50.203 --> 24:51.971
I need you to secure
the zip drive.

24:52.022 --> 24:53.806
You heard my boss.

24:53.857 --> 24:55.324
Hand it over.

24:56.593 --> 24:57.693
No.

24:57.727 --> 24:59.862
Do not make me
do this, John.

24:59.896 --> 25:01.530
You know what
I'm capable of.

25:01.565 --> 25:03.532
Just hand it over
before someone gets hurt.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.534
Sorry, Morgan.

25:22.886 --> 25:25.170
God, I love the Intersect.

25:29.009 --> 25:30.225
Oh, really?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.961
That's what
we're going to do here?

25:42.038 --> 25:44.189
Zorn arrives
in L.A. tonight.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.041
Business meeting
downtown.

25:46.076 --> 25:47.443
Just enough
time for him

25:47.477 --> 25:49.745
to switch planes
and disappear.

25:49.779 --> 25:51.697
Whoa. Let me see
that last tail number.

25:52.749 --> 25:53.866
Helicopter.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.517
I'll pull up satellite
on the address.

25:57.387 --> 25:59.722
Looks like a helipad to me.
That's where we'll grab him.

25:59.756 --> 26:02.424
Carmichael Industries will be
seven figures in the black.

26:02.459 --> 26:04.159
Won't be long till we're
the new Verbanski Corp.

26:04.177 --> 26:06.795
Guys, I think we should talk
about Morgan and Gertrude.

26:06.829 --> 26:08.347
I told you, Walker,
she's dead to me.

26:08.381 --> 26:11.800
Well, then, how do you explain
whatever that was

26:11.834 --> 26:13.886
in her office?

26:13.937 --> 26:15.521
Clearly, you still
have feelings for her.

26:15.555 --> 26:17.356
And you-- I know
what Morgan did hurt you,

26:17.390 --> 26:18.841
but you saw the way
he was behaving.

26:18.875 --> 26:20.109
I really think
it's time to admit

26:20.143 --> 26:21.510
this is more than just
an ego problem.

26:21.544 --> 26:22.728
Pure seventh-grade Morgan.

26:22.779 --> 26:24.113
But what if it's not?

26:24.147 --> 26:25.881
What if Morgan needs help?

26:25.915 --> 26:27.416
Sarah, he said that we're
not friends anymore,

26:27.450 --> 26:29.251
so how am I supposed
to help him now?

26:32.355 --> 26:34.323
So, Jeff, when's the last time

26:34.357 --> 26:35.557
you saw a doctor?

26:35.592 --> 26:37.092
Um...

26:37.127 --> 26:40.329
when was the last time
I got something stuck up in me?

26:41.765 --> 26:44.600
Okay, just going to ask you
a few questions.

26:44.634 --> 26:45.968
All right, Jeff.

26:46.002 --> 26:47.586
Have any trouble
focusing?

26:47.637 --> 26:49.555
Mmm...
Whoa. Yeah.

26:50.974 --> 26:52.708
Ow. Okay.

26:52.726 --> 26:54.309
That's a yes.

26:54.344 --> 26:56.378
Any problems with your
short-term memory, Jeff?

26:56.413 --> 26:59.081
Uh... hey, Doc.

26:59.115 --> 27:02.217
Do you know
I'm cha-cha under here?

27:02.235 --> 27:04.086
All right, buddy,
keep the gown down.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.689
Do you have any trouble
performing at work?

27:06.723 --> 27:07.890
I got that one.

27:07.924 --> 27:09.942
We're going to mark that
as a yes as well.

27:09.993 --> 27:11.777
All right, I'm just
going to write you

27:11.828 --> 27:15.064
a script here, buddy,
and get you on your way.

27:15.098 --> 27:17.082
Should take care of
all your problems.

27:17.117 --> 27:19.618
Goody. Pills.

27:19.669 --> 27:21.937
Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.205
Okay?

27:23.239 --> 27:24.807
Doctor's orders.

27:24.841 --> 27:26.008
<i>What are you saying?</i>

27:26.042 --> 27:27.242
<i>Is there something wrong</i>
<i>with Morgan?</i>

27:27.260 --> 27:28.944
Well, I just...

27:28.978 --> 27:30.713
I-I feel like he's
losing himself.

27:30.747 --> 27:32.114
I mean, why would
the Intersect

27:32.148 --> 27:33.716
act so differently
in Morgan's head

27:33.750 --> 27:34.916
versus Chuck's head?

27:34.934 --> 27:36.251
Well, because it's
a different program.

27:36.286 --> 27:38.053
Somebody modified
Dad's original.

27:38.088 --> 27:40.055
Look, if you think
that there's something wrong,

27:40.090 --> 27:41.607
you should have
the CIA remove it.

27:41.641 --> 27:43.925
Yeah, I just don't think
he's going to go for that.

27:43.943 --> 27:46.428
Like I said, Morgan is not
acting like Morgan at all.

27:46.463 --> 27:48.363
Well, you need to try
to get through to him.

27:48.398 --> 27:49.865
How?

27:49.899 --> 27:52.301
Well, you could try
to appeal to his memory.

27:52.335 --> 27:54.336
You know, I've had
temporal lobe patients

27:54.370 --> 27:55.537
who've responded to stories

27:55.572 --> 27:57.072
about who they were
before the injury.

27:57.107 --> 27:59.341
It doesn't
return them to normal,

27:59.375 --> 28:01.610
but it sort of helps them
cut through the fog--

28:01.644 --> 28:02.944
in this case, the Intersect.

28:02.962 --> 28:05.447
Gives them a glimpse
of who they used to be.

28:05.482 --> 28:06.982
<i>Agent Walker,</i>

28:07.016 --> 28:08.484
is the target in custody?

28:08.518 --> 28:10.285
No. This isn't about Zorn;
it's about the Intersect.

28:10.303 --> 28:11.787
It's malfunctioning in Morgan.

28:11.805 --> 28:14.289
Morgan Grimes has the Intersect?

28:14.324 --> 28:15.724
Look, it was a mistake.

28:15.759 --> 28:17.526
Remember the glasses
that you sent to us

28:17.560 --> 28:19.344
after we took down Volkoff?

28:19.395 --> 28:20.763
Listen to me, Walker.

28:20.797 --> 28:23.165
I never sent you
Intersect glasses.

28:24.367 --> 28:26.635
What? Well, then, who did?

28:26.669 --> 28:27.969
Ready, Casey?
Let's go.

28:27.987 --> 28:29.304
Where you
been, Walker?

28:29.339 --> 28:30.739
Zorn's not going
to wait for us.

28:30.774 --> 28:32.357
I just talked to Beckman.
It's about Morgan.

28:32.408 --> 28:34.276
The Intersect that he uploaded,
it wasn't from her.

28:34.310 --> 28:35.511
What? Then, who?

28:35.545 --> 28:37.312
Decker or somebody else
in the CIA. She doesn't know.

28:37.347 --> 28:39.348
Why would anyone want
to hurt Morgan?

28:39.382 --> 28:41.150
You.

28:41.184 --> 28:43.185
- It was meant for you.
- I spoke to your sister,

28:43.219 --> 28:45.053
and Morgan's behavior
is not his fault.

28:45.088 --> 28:46.822
It's the Intersect.

28:46.856 --> 28:49.658
<i>Whatever was added to</i>
<i>the program is destroying him.</i>

28:49.692 --> 28:50.993
<i>He's forgetting who he is.</i>

28:51.027 --> 28:52.227
<i>Little Allie.</i>

28:52.262 --> 28:54.179
I can do better.

28:54.214 --> 28:55.664
- Wow. Good job, Indy.
- Who?

28:55.682 --> 28:58.000
<i>He didn't remember</i>
<i>Indiana Jones.</i>

28:58.034 --> 28:59.635
So <i>Star Wars</i>
<i>or</i> <i>Die Hard?</i>

28:59.669 --> 29:01.386
Ah, you pick, man.

29:01.437 --> 29:02.504
That's more
your thing.

<i>Oh, my God, this isn't just</i>
<i>seventh-grade Morgan.</i>

29:06.743 --> 29:08.677
I can't believe
I didn't see this earlier.

29:08.711 --> 29:09.945
He was my best friend.

29:09.979 --> 29:11.513
Is my best friend.

29:11.548 --> 29:14.015
Sarah, we got to find him.
According to Beckman,

29:14.033 --> 29:15.384
he's on his way downtown
to the Marriott.

29:15.418 --> 29:17.352
He's tracking Zorn?
Must have copied that zip drive.

29:17.387 --> 29:19.555
Little snake in the grass.

29:19.589 --> 29:21.356
Right, it's not his fault.

29:23.459 --> 29:24.993
Guys, let's save Morgan.

29:26.246 --> 29:28.730
If we must.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.280
♪ ♪

29:42.280 --> 29:43.396
No sign of Zorn.

29:43.431 --> 29:45.265
Must be holed up
in one of the rooms.

29:45.299 --> 29:47.033
Hopefully, his helicopter
will be landing soon

29:47.068 --> 29:49.636
and we won't have any trouble
subduing his flight crew.

29:49.670 --> 29:51.037
Or security detail--
he usually travels

29:51.072 --> 29:52.405
with at least four
former operatives.

29:52.439 --> 29:54.941
Guys, Morgan should
be here by now.

29:54.976 --> 29:57.627
His team had a
head start on us.

29:57.662 --> 29:59.045
Maybe something
came up.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.513
Maybe he betrayed
them, too.

30:02.116 --> 30:03.583
He left Alex.

30:04.785 --> 30:06.920
Well, maybe his brain is
breaking down so fast

30:06.954 --> 30:09.306
that the Morgan we
knew is already gone.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.758

30:37.651 --> 30:38.985
They're going

32:37.988 --> 32:39.205
Can't you see it?

32:39.240 --> 32:40.673
Can't you feel the
Intersect changing you?

32:40.708 --> 32:42.375
That's-That's why you're not
acting like yourself.

32:42.409 --> 32:45.078
Why would I want
to act like myself? Huh?

32:45.112 --> 32:46.579
Do you even remember
who I was before?

32:46.613 --> 32:48.414
Yes, Morgan!

32:48.449 --> 32:49.516
Do you?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.361
Holy hell! Is that real?

33:01.395 --> 33:03.830
Turn off the engine, Zorn!

33:07.835 --> 33:08.634
Aah.

33:11.355 --> 33:13.873
Stop the engine or I will
blow us all to hell!

33:18.412 --> 33:20.013
Morgan, you're not a killer.

33:20.047 --> 33:21.948
Shut up, Chuck, okay?
How would you know?

33:23.367 --> 33:24.484
Because you got
pantsed by

33:24.518 --> 33:26.319
Meredith Lester
in seventh grade.

33:26.353 --> 33:27.654
Chuck, you've got to unlock
his memory.

33:27.688 --> 33:30.173
I don't even remember
seventh grade.

33:30.207 --> 33:31.124
Sure you do.

33:31.158 --> 33:32.458
Put the gun down, Morgan,

33:32.493 --> 33:34.360
and try to remember
what she did to you.

33:34.395 --> 33:36.329
Even if I did remember,
Chuck-- why?

33:36.347 --> 33:37.764
Why would I want to remember

33:37.798 --> 33:39.632
being humiliated
by some stupid girl?

33:39.667 --> 33:41.384
Because then you'd remember
how we got back at her.

33:41.435 --> 33:43.636
What do you mean "we"?
Yeah, "we."

33:43.670 --> 33:45.071
I'm your best friend.
Always have been.

33:45.105 --> 33:46.706
Who else would have
helped you stand up

33:46.740 --> 33:48.074
to the queen of eighth grade?

33:51.529 --> 33:52.729
What did we do, exactly?

33:52.780 --> 33:55.348
We stole Meredith's ham sandwich
during homeroom,

33:55.366 --> 33:56.349
and then we...

33:56.367 --> 33:57.683
Did something to it.

33:57.701 --> 33:58.985
Yeah...

33:59.019 --> 34:00.519
we spiced it up somehow.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.854
Yes. Yes!

34:01.872 --> 34:02.739
You're right, Morgan.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.240
But what did
we put in it?

34:04.291 --> 34:06.326
Something... it was something
really, really awful.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.627
I can see it in my head.

34:07.661 --> 34:08.710
I can't, I just,
I can't, it's like a...

34:08.746 --> 34:12.081
gnarly, curly...
like a cockroach leg...

34:12.132 --> 34:13.498
my-my mustache!

34:13.533 --> 34:14.333
Yes!

34:14.368 --> 34:15.969
We shaved off my first mustache

34:16.003 --> 34:17.554
and we sprinkled it
on her sandwich!

34:17.588 --> 34:18.704
I remember now.

34:18.722 --> 34:21.341
Chuck, I... I remember.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.009
That's who you are.

34:23.043 --> 34:24.911
That's who I am.

34:27.147 --> 34:29.349
Please... take me to jail.

34:30.317 --> 34:32.068
You're all a bunch of maniacs.

34:35.422 --> 34:37.223
You cuff him,
I'll grab the case.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.324
Does that mean
we split the bounty?

34:41.495 --> 34:43.996
I'm sure we can
work something out.

34:46.634 --> 34:49.034
Gertrude... can I...
can I have a minute?

34:50.404 --> 34:51.737
Oh...

34:53.340 --> 34:54.841
Listen, I just wanted
to say thank you

34:54.875 --> 34:56.175
for the opportunity,

34:56.210 --> 34:57.594
but I don't think
it's gonna work out.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.781
Ah, poor kid. That's tough.

35:08.522 --> 35:09.589
Morgan!

35:14.761 --> 35:15.612
Oh, God...

35:21.735 --> 35:23.269
The auxiliary tank's gonna blow
the whole roof!

35:26.156 --> 35:27.740
Hey, Chuck!

36:03.477 --> 36:05.745
I knew you were
into me, John.

36:05.779 --> 36:07.246
Shut up, Gertrude.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.669
Thank God.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.960
Still friends.

36:22.997 --> 36:24.063
No.

36:25.299 --> 36:26.432
Of course.

36:26.467 --> 36:29.402
Thank you.

36:29.436 --> 36:30.703
Thanks for pantsing me.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.423
Anytime, buddy.

36:33.474 --> 36:35.475
Anytime.

36:49.411 --> 36:50.929
You're gonna be late.

36:50.963 --> 36:52.630
If I take the Smith and Wesson,

36:52.665 --> 36:55.200
it'll show her that
I'm rugged and dependable.

36:55.234 --> 36:57.035
Maybe the Sig,

36:57.069 --> 36:58.870
she'll think I'm
cool and sophisticated.

37:00.206 --> 37:01.089
I'll just take 'em both.

37:02.725 --> 37:04.408
So you're taking Verbanski
to the gun range

37:04.426 --> 37:06.177
on your first date?

37:06.212 --> 37:07.295
Weird move, huh?

37:07.346 --> 37:09.581
No, I think she's
going to love it.

37:09.615 --> 37:10.682
Well, good luck.

37:10.716 --> 37:12.450
Sure you don't want
to tag along,

37:12.484 --> 37:13.585
follow in the van?

37:13.619 --> 37:15.019
I am wired for sound.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.422
I think this is
a solo mission.

37:17.456 --> 37:19.157
Yeah.

37:19.191 --> 37:20.191
Thanks, Walker.

37:22.094 --> 37:23.111
Hey.

37:24.563 --> 37:26.481
Is Casey wearing
Morgan's cologne?

37:26.532 --> 37:27.966
Unfortunately.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.767
- What's this?
- Courtesy of General Diane Beckman

37:29.785 --> 37:31.269
and the United States
government.

37:31.287 --> 37:32.437
Our bounty money
for Zorn.

37:32.471 --> 37:34.172
Wow. That's a lot of zeroes.

37:34.206 --> 37:35.439
That's just the
beginning, honey.

37:35.457 --> 37:37.542
Carmichael Industries
has a new lease on life.

37:37.576 --> 37:38.793
Wonderful.

38:06.071 --> 38:08.773
Dude, quick,
give me five bucks.

38:08.807 --> 38:10.241
Why do you need
five dollars?

38:10.276 --> 38:12.343
'Cause Fernando says
that if we give him 20,

38:12.378 --> 38:14.279
he's gonna let me
Taser his nads.

38:15.648 --> 38:17.949
Is that a good idea?

38:17.983 --> 38:19.784
What do you care if something's
a good idea of not.

38:19.818 --> 38:20.752
Could I have the
money, please?

38:20.786 --> 38:23.821
It just sounds...
really dangerous.

38:23.856 --> 38:25.707
Yeah. I know.
What if we kill him?

38:25.758 --> 38:26.791
That's totally
worth 20 bucks.

38:26.825 --> 38:28.493
I will not be party

38:28.527 --> 38:30.728
to the reckless endangerment
of a coworker.

38:30.763 --> 38:34.098
And, if I might add,
a friend.

38:34.133 --> 38:35.883
What is going on with you?

38:35.935 --> 38:37.668
Dude... are you high?

38:37.686 --> 38:38.736
What'd you take?

38:38.771 --> 38:40.071
Far from it, Lester.

38:40.105 --> 38:41.940
In fact, I'm seeing
things clearly

38:41.974 --> 38:43.708
for the first time
in a long time.

38:43.742 --> 38:44.909
Now, if you'll excuse me,

38:44.944 --> 38:47.278
I have to go put my
quinoa salad in the fridge.

38:50.516 --> 38:52.683
Quin...?

38:52.701 --> 38:55.036
Good news--
your vitals look fine.

38:55.070 --> 38:56.754
Good.

38:56.789 --> 38:58.456
I don't feel fine, though.

38:58.490 --> 38:59.907
And I certainly haven't been
acting fine.

38:59.959 --> 39:01.025
Don't worry, Morgan.

39:01.043 --> 39:02.660
I know a very good
brain doctor.

39:02.694 --> 39:06.064
Almost... almost lost myself
to this thing in my head,

39:06.098 --> 39:07.532
so I want it out,
you know?

39:07.566 --> 39:10.034
But, uh, to be honest,
I... I don't know.

39:10.069 --> 39:11.886
Part of me thinks
I'll kind of miss it.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.639
The Intersect
made me this-this, like,

39:14.673 --> 39:16.808
super cool super-spy, you know?

39:16.842 --> 39:18.309
Now I go back to
being some schmuck

39:18.344 --> 39:19.811
who works at the
Buy More, you know?

39:19.845 --> 39:21.546
I know how you feel.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.381
- You do?
- Yeah.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.552
You know, when I first
became a stay-at-home dad,

39:27.586 --> 39:29.554
I lost my identity.

39:29.588 --> 39:32.023
You mind if I give you
a word of advice, bro?

39:32.057 --> 39:33.558
Of course, dude, yeah.

39:33.592 --> 39:34.726
Please. Fire away.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.161
Don't confuse
a job with your life.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.231
Thanks.

39:45.237 --> 39:47.772
How'd that date
with my ex-boss go?

39:47.806 --> 39:49.007
What do you want?

39:49.975 --> 39:52.276
Uh... to apologize.

39:52.311 --> 39:54.429
The Intersect made
me a total jerk.

39:54.463 --> 39:55.763
Not that it was completely
the Intersect's fault.

39:55.798 --> 39:57.682
I mean, it just kind of
brought out my inner jerk.

39:57.716 --> 39:59.117
Who knew?

39:59.151 --> 40:02.520
Anyway, my point is,
I'm sorry, you know?

40:02.554 --> 40:04.222
I'm sorry that I
ever left the team,

40:04.256 --> 40:06.057
I'm sorry that I
took the zip drive,

40:06.091 --> 40:07.291
but most importantly,

40:07.326 --> 40:11.429
I am really sorry
for what I did to Alex.

40:11.463 --> 40:13.364
I was just a bozo.

40:15.467 --> 40:17.035
So what do you say, roomie?
Huh?

40:17.069 --> 40:18.569
Another chance?

40:21.123 --> 40:24.876
You know, I'll just...

40:26.111 --> 40:27.445
The couch maybe, or...?

40:28.797 --> 40:29.780
Morgan.

40:29.798 --> 40:30.948
Hi. Sorry.

40:30.966 --> 40:31.966
Casey kicked me out.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.301
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey.

40:33.335 --> 40:34.469
Let me talk to him.

40:34.503 --> 40:37.889
No, no, no, no...
I kinda had it coming.

40:37.923 --> 40:39.390
So...

40:39.425 --> 40:40.825
Well, okay, where are
you gonna live?

40:40.859 --> 40:43.628
I don't know, but that's cool.

40:43.662 --> 40:46.564
Jeff said that I could, uh,
crash in his van.

40:46.598 --> 40:48.232
You know that he's not
using it now.

40:48.267 --> 40:49.467
You know? So...

40:49.485 --> 40:51.402
Yeah, I'll be
all right.

40:51.437 --> 40:53.471
You know, just till
I get on my feet.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.774
Absolutely not, Morgan.

40:56.809 --> 40:59.243
You're gonna stay with us.

40:59.278 --> 41:01.612
Guys, I... I mean, after
everything that's...

41:01.647 --> 41:02.914
I don't know what to say.

41:02.948 --> 41:04.449
Say you're gonna lose
the frosted tips.

41:04.483 --> 41:05.783
Okay, fine.

41:08.587 --> 41:09.620
Oh.

41:10.722 --> 41:12.173
Well, lookie
who's back in business.

41:12.207 --> 41:13.991
Beckman must have been
so impressed

41:14.026 --> 41:15.326
with how we handled Zorn,

41:15.360 --> 41:17.879
she's got a nice, big, juicy
contract waiting for us.

41:17.930 --> 41:19.097
Fantastic, man! Great!

41:19.131 --> 41:20.331
Can I take Scotty back on?

41:20.349 --> 41:21.299
Mm-mm.

41:21.333 --> 41:22.300
I'm kidding.

41:22.334 --> 41:24.502
He's... I don't even...

41:24.520 --> 41:25.937
But he's kinda...
did you meet him?

41:25.971 --> 41:27.572
He's just kind of a...
he's a good kid.

41:27.606 --> 41:28.606
Mm-mm.

41:37.549 --> 41:39.717
We have another problem, Chuck.

41:39.751 --> 41:40.868
There's something I thought
you should see.

41:42.905 --> 41:46.190
This is a kill order.
This has gotta be a mistake.

41:46.225 --> 41:48.993
Morgan told anyone who wanted
to hear he had the Intersect.

41:49.027 --> 41:50.928
The CIA does
not like that.

41:50.963 --> 41:51.929
It was a mistake.

41:51.964 --> 41:52.830
C-Can't you call it off?

41:52.865 --> 41:54.298
This goes way above my head.

41:54.333 --> 41:56.167
Decker...

41:56.201 --> 41:58.503
He wants Morgan dead.

42:00.038 --> 42:03.474
Get Morgan off
the street-- now.

42:03.509 --> 42:04.342
Protect him.

42:04.376 --> 42:05.393
Protect your friend, Chuck.

42:11.950 --> 42:14.185
<i>Come on, Morgan, pick up.</i>
