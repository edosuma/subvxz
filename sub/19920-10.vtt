00:00.108 --> 00:02.976
- <i>Previously on "Shots Fired"...</i>
- I killed Joey Campbell.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.640
<i>Had Lieutenant Breeland
not intimidated me,</i>

00:05.718 --> 00:07.586
<i>I would have come forward sooner.</i>

00:07.672 --> 00:08.953
You did this.

00:08.992 --> 00:11.074
This is Ms. Hadad.
It's gonna be a supervised visit.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.309
I've lost Kai.

00:13.044 --> 00:14.711
Breeland has to be behind this.

00:27.639 --> 00:28.906
Sweetheart...

00:44.075 --> 00:46.009
Every man, every available unit.

00:46.077 --> 00:47.744
Wake every son of a bitch up.

00:52.474 --> 00:54.851
- Preston Terry.
- You should know.

00:54.983 --> 00:56.620
Someone killed Breeland.

01:15.806 --> 01:16.940
Come on!

01:17.008 --> 01:18.608
I got these two!

01:19.566 --> 01:21.044
- Open up!
- Open up!

01:23.514 --> 01:26.050
Agent Akino, something's
going down at the Houses.

01:26.104 --> 01:27.784
We need you to get here.

01:28.979 --> 01:30.513
Ecklund!

01:30.650 --> 01:32.151
I got this.

01:40.958 --> 01:42.388
What is all this?

01:42.700 --> 01:45.256
Lieutenant Breeland was killed tonight.

01:46.709 --> 01:47.871
You know anything?

01:48.894 --> 01:50.106
No.

01:52.284 --> 01:54.535
Okay, just stay inside, all right?

01:59.362 --> 02:01.218
- This is America?
- Yo, that's not right!

02:01.285 --> 02:03.456
Navy SEALs showed more restraint
raiding Bin Laden!

02:03.510 --> 02:05.755
- Back off!
- Record him, record everything.

02:05.823 --> 02:07.937
What are you restraining him for?

02:09.994 --> 02:11.394
All right, all right, man.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.930
Take it easy.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.377
Hey!

02:15.494 --> 02:17.033
What the hell is going on?

02:17.058 --> 02:18.764
Boy, get back in the house.

02:18.789 --> 02:21.623
A murder was committed on my turf.
You have no place here.

02:21.648 --> 02:24.637
Sheriff, this is excessive force
bordering on harassment.

02:24.715 --> 02:26.627
A few hours ago, Lieutenant Breeland

02:26.652 --> 02:28.277
told his daughter
he was coming over here

02:28.302 --> 02:30.722
to apologize to Shameeka Campbell.
Now he's dead.

02:30.747 --> 02:32.441
You call it excessive,
I call it thorough.

02:32.495 --> 02:34.484
Wasn't he shot on his own property?

02:34.597 --> 02:36.264
After leaving here,
we believe he was followed.

02:36.332 --> 02:37.933
So you don't know who did it?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.501
Somebody here knows something.

02:39.569 --> 02:41.369
And we're gonna come back here

02:41.437 --> 02:44.506
every day if we have to
until somebody talks.

02:57.086 --> 02:59.443
I was trying to reach you all night.

02:59.822 --> 03:01.537
Deputy Carroll called.

03:02.037 --> 03:05.506
He was impressed by the way
you handled that confession with Arlen.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.862
He wants us back front and center.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.666
Where were you?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.136
I went for a drive.

03:15.248 --> 03:16.748
Had to clear my head.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.539
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:30.958 --> 03:33.521
Could you think of anything
your husband said recently

03:33.589 --> 03:36.489
that seemed out of character?

03:36.692 --> 03:39.061
He said he was considering
early retirement.

03:43.651 --> 03:45.165
It just came out of nowhere.

03:45.251 --> 03:47.502
I figured it was just midlife stuff.

03:48.634 --> 03:51.633
Dad said something to me yesterday.

03:51.831 --> 03:55.055
He was that he was there
when Joey Campbell was killed,

03:55.422 --> 03:57.313
and that he was trying to cover it up

03:57.375 --> 03:58.713
to protect the people who were with him.

03:59.481 --> 04:01.747
Did he say who he was trying to protect?

04:01.856 --> 04:06.622
No, but he said he was also
blackmailing someone.

04:07.690 --> 04:09.770
That he was just trying
to make it right.

04:09.887 --> 04:11.693
I-I'm sorry, I can't do this today.

04:11.761 --> 04:12.894
I'm sorry.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.796
It's okay, you just...

04:14.864 --> 04:17.857
If you want to know anything else,
we're gonna have to do it another time.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.934
Thank you, ma'am, for your time.

04:26.411 --> 04:29.285
Breeland should've been
locked up, not murdered.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.356
What's done is done.

04:30.381 --> 04:32.314
We just need to focus on
presenting to the grand jury.

04:32.381 --> 04:34.382
How am I supposed to move
to indict Beck now?

04:34.450 --> 04:37.185
Without Breeland's testimony,
it'll be next to impossible

04:37.245 --> 04:38.979
to prove Jesse wasn't there to buy weed.

04:39.368 --> 04:41.523
I'll just have to get
that guy Lyndon to talk.

04:41.590 --> 04:42.724
He already said.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.326
He worked for Joey and he sold to Jesse.

04:44.393 --> 04:46.161
A grown man selling drugs for a kid?

04:46.228 --> 04:47.929
He lied his ass off.

04:48.114 --> 04:49.607
I just have to get him to admit it.

04:53.395 --> 04:55.545
You believe how hot it is today?

04:56.082 --> 04:58.073
Yeah, global-ass warming.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.528
What the hell do you want?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.145
I was on the other side of the glass

05:04.213 --> 05:06.548
when you told that fairy tale
at the Sheriff's office.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.383
The one about Jesse and Joey.

05:08.451 --> 05:09.651
Let me hear it again.

05:09.719 --> 05:12.220
I sold weed for Joey.
Jesse was a customer.

05:12.511 --> 05:13.886
The end.

05:13.964 --> 05:16.635
Except Jesse didn't get high
and Joey stopped dealing.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.493
This really how you wanna play this?

05:18.698 --> 05:21.080
Your boy Breeland ain't here
to protect you.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.887
Go ahead, put hands on me.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.662
Give me an excuse to pay your ass back

05:25.716 --> 05:27.326
for that bunk-ass story you sold.

05:32.906 --> 05:34.773
I'm just trying to do right.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.145
Keeping my job
so I could stay on parole.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.781
But y'all seem to keep the thumb on us.

05:38.914 --> 05:40.148
Keep talking.

05:40.216 --> 05:42.350
Breeland used my parole as leverage.

05:42.418 --> 05:44.640
Always sweating me
when he needed favors.

05:44.694 --> 05:45.897
So you come into the sheriff's department

05:45.968 --> 05:48.163
lying on Jesse and Joey?
That was a favor?

05:49.507 --> 05:51.784
I'm sure you wanna do right

05:51.878 --> 05:53.761
after rolling over for a dirty cop.

05:54.222 --> 05:56.431
You were promised amnesty,
you'll get it.

05:56.499 --> 05:58.466
I just need you to say
all this on the stand.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.936
You lie up there, your ass is
going straight back to jail.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.211
How much of a role do you think
race played in this?

06:10.279 --> 06:11.606
A big one.

06:11.653 --> 06:14.387
You want my advice? Stick to the facts.

06:14.481 --> 06:16.965
In this climate, race will make
everybody uncomfortable.

06:16.990 --> 06:19.397
You'll lose the grand jury,
whom I can assure you

06:19.468 --> 06:22.423
is gonna look a whole lot more
like me than you or Beck.

06:22.491 --> 06:24.459
You want me to ignore race
in a civil rights case?

06:24.644 --> 06:25.844
He felt ostracized.

06:25.889 --> 06:27.757
It affected him
when he approached Jesse.

06:27.827 --> 06:30.555
Beck's actions are being
presented to the grand jury,

06:30.688 --> 06:32.844
not his color, not Jesse's.

06:33.445 --> 06:35.656
Race was a contributing factor.

06:36.038 --> 06:37.805
I can't ignore that.

06:41.476 --> 06:43.943
Mr. Terry, can you comment
on the indictment?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.607
Mr. Terry, how do you feel
about the government's case

06:45.632 --> 06:46.780
- against Deputy Beck?
- No comment.

06:46.805 --> 06:49.780
Wait, is this case more
about justice or politics?

06:50.390 --> 06:53.374
<i>- What? I didn't do anything.
- License and registration now.</i>

06:57.140 --> 06:58.460
<i>- Get out.
- I'm sorry.</i>

06:58.523 --> 06:59.841
- <i>Out of the car!
- I'm sorry, all right?</i>

06:59.914 --> 07:01.435
<i>Get out!</i>

07:01.997 --> 07:04.216
Is this video consistent
with Deputy Beck's statement?

07:04.310 --> 07:06.301
No. During our initial interview,

07:06.368 --> 07:08.469
Deputy Beck said that
after refusing to comply,

07:08.537 --> 07:11.172
Jesse eventually opened his car door.

07:11.234 --> 07:13.414
But in the video,
it's clear that Deputy Beck

07:13.453 --> 07:15.410
physically pulls Jesse from his vehicle.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.078
And did you ask him what prompted him

07:17.146 --> 07:18.641
to pull Jesse Carr over that day?

07:18.702 --> 07:21.379
Yes. Deputy Beck
said he pulled Jesse over

07:21.442 --> 07:23.284
because he was a white guy
in that neighborhood,

07:23.352 --> 07:24.614
and I quote,

07:24.676 --> 07:27.303
"A white guy in that
neighborhood means drugs."

07:27.328 --> 07:28.663
And were his suspicions correct?

07:28.717 --> 07:30.467
Was Jesse Carr in that
neighborhood to buy drugs?

07:30.514 --> 07:32.764
Lieutenant Breeland,
the first officer on the scene,

07:32.870 --> 07:35.205
reportedly located marijuana
in the glove compartment.

07:36.264 --> 07:37.957
I believe this is false testimony.

07:38.019 --> 07:40.183
I believe Lieutenant Breeland

07:40.245 --> 07:42.110
planted the marijuana
in Jesse's glove compartment

07:42.191 --> 07:43.832
in order to make an unlawful stop

07:43.871 --> 07:46.107
that resulted in murder look legit.

07:46.715 --> 07:48.571
And did you investigate this theory?

07:48.649 --> 07:52.146
Yes. I discovered that Beck had
threatened to come forward

07:52.214 --> 07:54.333
about abuses within
the sheriff's department

07:54.403 --> 07:56.084
involving Lieutenant Breeland.

07:56.151 --> 07:58.353
This was shortly
before the Jesse Carr shooting.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.888
I believe that Lieutenant Breeland
planted the marijuana

08:00.956 --> 08:03.372
in order to control Beck
and the situation.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.531
And can you please explain to the jury

08:06.578 --> 08:09.297
why Lieutenant Breeland isn't
here to testify to that himself?

08:11.634 --> 08:13.422
He's deceased.

08:15.649 --> 08:18.272
Do you believe Lieutenant Breeland
would testify that information

08:18.340 --> 08:19.336
if he were here today?

08:19.813 --> 08:21.178
Yes.

08:22.220 --> 08:23.420
Thank you.

08:35.190 --> 08:37.032
I swear I don't understand this.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.827
It's like a damn free-for-all
for the prosecutor.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.429
Witnesses get to speculate,
and I'm not even there

08:42.530 --> 08:43.998
or even get a chance
to have my attorney...

08:44.066 --> 08:46.467
It's-it's not a trial, it's a hearing.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.649
And you have something most
others in your position do not.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.739
Once a cop says that
he feared for his life,

08:51.807 --> 08:53.441
it's almost impossible to indict.

08:53.509 --> 08:54.676
Trust me.

09:08.023 --> 09:08.956
Oh!

09:13.322 --> 09:15.002
- Here.
- Ooh.

09:19.468 --> 09:21.235
Jeremiah! Christian!

09:21.303 --> 09:23.426
Boys, get back here!

09:23.806 --> 09:25.039
This is not...

09:25.107 --> 09:26.040
Excuse me.

09:26.475 --> 09:28.276
Hi, he dropped this.

09:34.552 --> 09:37.498
It gets a lot easier, I promise.

09:39.955 --> 09:40.888
Thank you.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.115
They're precious.

09:58.082 --> 10:00.653
Should any unrest break out,
Menard County's on call

10:00.692 --> 10:01.779
in case we need backup.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.044
That's not why I asked you here.
Have a seat.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.033
Sheriff, I trusted you with
the Auxiliary Deputy program.

10:10.072 --> 10:12.874
It was your job to keep
the volunteer deputies

10:12.942 --> 10:15.043
and the citizens of Gate Station safe.

10:15.111 --> 10:18.050
Regardless of the outcome
of these grand jury proceedings,

10:18.121 --> 10:20.472
you failed miserably.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.650
Unfortunately, Lieutenant Breeland...

10:22.718 --> 10:24.769
Let's not scapegoat the dead.

10:25.087 --> 10:27.173
I'm demanding your resignation.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.291
Forgive me if I'm not exactly inclined

10:30.359 --> 10:32.259
to heed your demands, Governor.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.129
You'll heed, Sheriff.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.232
I'm personally committed to that.

10:38.901 --> 10:42.178
Why don't we just see what Arlen
has to say about this?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.392
Governor.

10:48.592 --> 10:50.693
Deputy Brooks, from your point of view,

10:50.829 --> 10:52.147
what was it like for Deputy Beck

10:52.751 --> 10:54.249
being the only black man on the force?

10:54.704 --> 10:59.473
I doubt it was fun for him,
but he never complained.

10:59.498 --> 11:00.855
And what about the tours?

11:01.591 --> 11:03.966
He never expressed his concern
over a program

11:04.029 --> 11:05.568
where wealthy white men

11:05.623 --> 11:08.560
were patrolling poor black neighborhoods
with your fellow police officers?

11:08.685 --> 11:09.831
Yeah.

11:10.168 --> 11:11.808
He hated it.

11:12.465 --> 11:14.869
Like, wanted to shut it down,
and he wasn't alone.

11:15.683 --> 11:17.558
I thought it was messed up, too,

11:17.773 --> 11:19.730
but it wasn't about skin color.

11:19.996 --> 11:21.943
It was about right and wrong.

11:22.011 --> 11:23.845
So you are testifying under oath
that Deputy Beck

11:23.913 --> 11:25.880
never felt isolated, never felt outcast?

11:25.948 --> 11:27.767
Well, yeah, he felt isolated,

11:28.251 --> 11:30.718
- but not just from the department.
- Then from whom?

11:33.102 --> 11:35.070
The black community.

11:35.776 --> 11:39.727
I'm not saying the sheriff's office
is some liberal utopia,

11:40.142 --> 11:42.118
but I know one thing:

11:42.595 --> 11:44.884
white people never called Beck
a sellout.

11:56.068 --> 11:57.685
I think Pierce was right.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.896
Should've taken race out of it.

12:00.630 --> 12:02.684
When we walk into that courtroom,

12:02.751 --> 12:05.942
we're asking a jury to ignore
whatever personal biases they carry.

12:06.028 --> 12:07.755
There's the law
and then there's reality.

12:13.044 --> 12:14.978
Something just came on the news.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.545
<i>Any last words?</i>

12:19.602 --> 12:21.023
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

12:21.077 --> 12:23.938
<i>I finally got my license
to shoot these crackers.</i>

12:24.006 --> 12:25.537
<i>That's right.</i>

12:25.562 --> 12:26.935
<i>Oh, man. That's my boy.</i>

12:26.960 --> 12:28.915
<i>No, no, you know I'm just playing, man.</i>

12:28.940 --> 12:32.647
<i>Uh, real talk, you know how hard
I've worked for this badge, man.</i>

12:33.550 --> 12:36.650
<i>It just feels good to be able
to do things the right way,</i>

12:36.784 --> 12:40.454
<i>you know, make a difference,
treat people with respect.</i>

12:40.918 --> 12:42.676
<i>I'll make y'all proud.</i>

12:48.363 --> 12:50.030
So what was that, the director's cut?

12:50.098 --> 12:52.581
A whole lot different than
the first video your paper put out.

12:52.644 --> 12:54.368
Beck's cousin reached out.

12:54.436 --> 12:58.105
He said he had a video of Beck
calling white people "crackers."

12:58.386 --> 13:02.350
Our paper needed inroads online,
so we paid him a thousand bucks for it.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.945
And you just decided to release
the most provocative part.

13:05.013 --> 13:06.814
My editor insisted.

13:06.882 --> 13:08.649
So why release the rest of the video?

13:08.717 --> 13:10.384
Your editor looking for more followers?

13:10.452 --> 13:11.619
I posted it.

13:11.686 --> 13:15.331
I don't know if Beck is guilty or not,

13:15.527 --> 13:19.326
but if the media is gonna
publicly lynch the man,

13:19.699 --> 13:21.815
I thought people should see it.

13:22.081 --> 13:25.733
The release of the full video
proves that my client is not a racist.

13:25.801 --> 13:27.334
As a matter of fact,

13:27.402 --> 13:30.104
Deputy Beck has been railroaded
by the DOJ,

13:30.172 --> 13:33.307
and I suggest they drop this case
and instead spend their efforts

13:33.375 --> 13:36.610
investigating the underbelly
of corruption in Gate Station.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.304
Hey, what's up?

13:39.748 --> 13:41.415
It's about Lyndon.

13:41.585 --> 13:43.484
Sheriff deputies
caught him selling drugs.

13:43.552 --> 13:45.586
They said he was using
the auto shop as a front.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.573
- That's convenient.
- Exactly.

13:47.635 --> 13:49.857
We gotta get him out.
We gotta get him on the stand.

13:49.925 --> 13:51.425
I tried. He's being processed.

13:51.493 --> 13:52.860
Also got himself a lawyer

13:52.928 --> 13:55.293
who says I coerced
a testimony out of him.

13:55.397 --> 13:57.254
You didn't, did you?

13:57.324 --> 13:59.366
- What?
- I'm sorry.

13:59.434 --> 14:00.801
I-I just have to wrap
my head around this.

14:00.826 --> 14:02.441
He was my star witness.

14:02.804 --> 14:06.240
Guess you'll have to give
a hell of a closing argument.

14:38.362 --> 14:40.574
I thought these proceedings
were about race.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.744
Maybe you thought these
proceedings were about race.

14:44.077 --> 14:45.344
After all, isn't that

14:45.369 --> 14:47.603
what our justice system's
always been about?

14:48.149 --> 14:50.518
Ever since the Jim Crow era,

14:50.853 --> 14:53.821
black men being sent to work camps

14:53.889 --> 14:56.024
for spitting on the sidewalk

14:56.524 --> 15:00.195
or making the god-awful mistake
of looking a white man in the eyes.

15:00.414 --> 15:02.412
That isn't just the history
of Gate Station.

15:02.475 --> 15:05.694
That is the history of this country.

15:08.615 --> 15:11.857
<i>We have a race-based justice system</i>

15:11.946 --> 15:14.891
<i>rooted in our biases,
rooted in our prejudices.</i>

15:23.485 --> 15:25.001
<i>It's that very same system</i>

15:25.087 --> 15:26.946
that taught Deputy Beck

15:27.017 --> 15:28.627
to be the officer he was revealed to be

15:28.728 --> 15:30.090
the day he encountered Jesse Carr.

15:30.158 --> 15:31.959
Great.

15:32.027 --> 15:34.069
Po-po.

15:34.702 --> 15:35.868
Check this out.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.910
You lost, boy?

15:46.041 --> 15:47.007
No, sir.

15:47.075 --> 15:48.301
These proceedings

15:48.371 --> 15:52.112
are about the common sense facts
of the case.

15:52.180 --> 15:53.447
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

15:53.515 --> 15:55.015
Why did you pull me over?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.183
'Cause you don't look right.

15:56.716 --> 15:59.186
I didn't realize it was illegal
to be in this part of town.

15:59.254 --> 16:00.421
Depends on what you're doing here.

16:01.888 --> 16:04.291
I came for some fried chicken.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.660
<i>Deputy Beck</i>

16:06.728 --> 16:08.833
pulled over an unarmed young man,

16:09.943 --> 16:12.366
a young man who posed
no threat of any kind.

16:12.434 --> 16:15.235
- License and registration.
- What? I didn't do anything!

16:15.303 --> 16:16.634
License and registration now.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.802
<i>Yet Deputy Beck chose
to escalate the situation.</i>

16:28.849 --> 16:30.623
- Get out. Get out of the car.
- Sorry.

16:30.719 --> 16:32.219
See, the facts suggest

16:32.623 --> 16:35.946
that marijuana had been planted
inside Jesse's vehicle

16:36.222 --> 16:38.025
in order to substantiate a stop

16:38.050 --> 16:40.332
that should have never been made
in the first place.

16:40.753 --> 16:43.579
His civil rights were violated.

16:43.610 --> 16:46.509
Deprivation of rights as defined by law.

16:46.587 --> 16:49.269
And as a result,
Jesse Carr lost his life.

16:50.484 --> 16:54.148
An indictment doesn't mean
that an accused is guilty or innocent.

16:54.836 --> 16:56.343
It just means that there have been

16:56.411 --> 16:58.412
enough unanswered questions
that have been presented

16:58.480 --> 17:00.014
to warrant a trial.

17:00.698 --> 17:02.847
History tells us

17:03.534 --> 17:05.105
that white jurors

17:05.339 --> 17:06.753
will empathize with the victim.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.954
I'm sorry, all right?

17:08.144 --> 17:09.857
Black jurors will empathize with
the shooter.

17:09.924 --> 17:12.126
- Get out of the car!
- I'm asking you all

17:12.193 --> 17:15.050
to stop yourselves right now
from doing that.

17:15.195 --> 17:16.896
- Why?
- Get out of the...

17:16.964 --> 17:19.532
I'm asking you to empathize
with a justice system

17:19.601 --> 17:22.410
that needs to answer
our prayers for fairness,

17:23.018 --> 17:24.907
common sense...

17:25.478 --> 17:27.089
and humanity.

17:28.237 --> 17:30.377
That is what is at stake here, folks:

17:30.445 --> 17:33.047
the humanity of our justice system.

17:39.676 --> 17:43.057
Because if Deputy Beck were a white cop

17:43.256 --> 17:45.131
who pulled over a black boy

17:45.326 --> 17:49.092
named Trayvon or Tamir or Emmett,

17:49.529 --> 17:52.108
I'd be asking for the same thing.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.790
I'd be asking for an indictment.

18:05.406 --> 18:06.999
All right, here we go.

18:07.048 --> 18:09.149
In about five minutes, the jury will be

18:09.259 --> 18:10.813
in their third hour of deliberations.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.173
It's crazy how it all
comes down to this.

18:13.275 --> 18:14.994
- What?
- The fate of justice

18:15.019 --> 18:17.621
in the hands of 16 randomly
selected people.

18:20.303 --> 18:21.503
What about you?

18:22.003 --> 18:24.128
Still believe in the system?

18:24.996 --> 18:27.433
I've seen many a guilty man walk.

18:28.199 --> 18:29.211
Makes you understand

18:29.279 --> 18:31.557
why people take matters
into their own hands.

18:33.714 --> 18:35.830
But failure's not an option.

18:36.086 --> 18:38.478
Beck, then Arlen, then Platt.

18:42.376 --> 18:43.962
Preston Terry.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.234
Thanks.

18:47.598 --> 18:49.338
Jury reached a decision.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.560
Hey.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.662
Josh?

19:19.833 --> 19:22.064
It's okay, it's okay.

19:40.150 --> 19:41.450
What's up?

19:42.819 --> 19:45.041
Josh, I'm sorry.

19:45.989 --> 19:47.589
I'm here to arrest you.

19:47.657 --> 19:49.079
No.

19:49.673 --> 19:51.560
They decided to indict.

19:59.669 --> 20:03.117
Do you mind if I get a minute
just to say good-bye?

20:03.195 --> 20:04.239
Yeah.

20:05.308 --> 20:06.475
Thanks.

20:10.313 --> 20:12.451
Damn it, it's not right.

20:12.949 --> 20:14.650
You're a good person.

20:14.718 --> 20:16.485
You're a good man.

20:33.136 --> 20:35.070
Hey, come here.

21:01.141 --> 21:02.598
I'm glad it's you, man.

21:02.665 --> 21:05.033
Pack him up and take him away.

21:05.210 --> 21:07.726
- Don't bring him back.
- Drive him away.

21:47.284 --> 21:48.682
Ms. Carr.

21:48.814 --> 21:50.573
Excuse me, Ms. Carr,

21:50.735 --> 21:53.036
can you tell us what this means to you?

22:02.292 --> 22:04.470
You're supposed to be
drinking champagne.

22:05.261 --> 22:07.550
I don't feel much like celebrating.

22:07.931 --> 22:09.131
Yeah.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.636
Today, when you said you understand

22:14.704 --> 22:16.638
why people take matters
into their own hands,

22:16.706 --> 22:18.073
what'd you mean by that?

22:22.655 --> 22:25.160
You have something you need to ask me?

22:25.754 --> 22:27.916
You have something you need to tell me?

22:30.486 --> 22:32.160
Yeah.

22:32.322 --> 22:34.512
This is a mistake.

22:34.891 --> 22:36.158
What is?

22:36.226 --> 22:37.292
This.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.894
Us.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.215
You know, I'd be hurt if you asked
what it is you're questioning,

22:44.176 --> 22:47.220
but at least I'd respect you
for having the guts to say it.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.205
Ashe...

22:50.306 --> 22:52.107
Ashe, hold up.

22:56.316 --> 22:59.853
It's been about three weeks
since Deputy Beck's indictment.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.472
Deliberations have resumed

23:01.527 --> 23:04.077
in the case of the U.S.
government versus Arlen Cox.

23:04.102 --> 23:05.697
You must indict.

23:05.765 --> 23:08.524
Make it right, you must indict.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.035
Mr. Terry, care to comment?

23:10.398 --> 23:11.536
Make it right.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.969
Mr. Cox is the founding officer
and CEO...

23:17.313 --> 23:19.852
Joey had a crush on a girl
from his class.

23:20.079 --> 23:22.438
Her mother insisted
he come over for dinner,

23:22.516 --> 23:24.742
you know, so the family
could get to know him better.

23:25.351 --> 23:27.118
Afterwards, he called to tell me that

23:27.243 --> 23:29.164
he could tell
the girl's mother liked him,

23:29.407 --> 23:33.058
especially when he told her
he wanted to enroll at NC St... State.

23:35.477 --> 23:36.661
I'm sorry.

23:36.852 --> 23:37.896
It's all right.

23:40.466 --> 23:42.695
He wasn't sure the dad
liked him, though,

23:43.135 --> 23:46.187
but he promised he would tell
me everything when he got home.

23:47.047 --> 23:49.255
The girl lived about ten minutes away.

23:49.408 --> 23:52.606
An hour went by
and I couldn't reach him.

23:53.045 --> 23:56.748
Soon after that, two cops,
Breeland and Derkin, came over.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.954
And they told me my boy had been shot.

24:06.176 --> 24:08.326
They said they thought
it was drug-related

24:08.472 --> 24:10.808
and they searched his bedroom.

24:11.540 --> 24:14.728
Then they said they recovered
weed from my son's bedroom.

24:14.775 --> 24:16.201
I didn't believe them,

24:16.855 --> 24:19.254
but they said since the drugs
were found in my home,

24:19.324 --> 24:22.011
that I could lose custody
of my youngest son, Shawn.

24:23.824 --> 24:25.443
Thank you, Ms. Campbell.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.013
No further questions.

24:39.692 --> 24:41.624
Between Cory and Shameeka,

24:41.710 --> 24:44.078
we've had excellent witness testimony.

24:44.630 --> 24:46.694
Mr. Terry, we should rest.

24:46.899 --> 24:48.066
Not yet.

24:49.735 --> 24:51.970
Not until I get Arlen on the stand.

24:55.374 --> 24:56.574
Mr. Terry.

24:59.478 --> 25:00.845
Mr. Wyatt?

25:01.317 --> 25:03.648
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

25:03.716 --> 25:05.150
What about?

25:05.217 --> 25:07.652
Breeland mentioned he was holding on
to some sensitive info.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.087
Info your people should see.

25:09.155 --> 25:10.355
I don't know what it was,

25:10.423 --> 25:12.090
but I think he may have had
a storage unit.

25:12.871 --> 25:14.973
- Where is it?
- I wish I could tell you.

25:15.059 --> 25:17.910
He wrote something about storage
two different times in a calendar.

25:17.997 --> 25:19.164
I'll keep digging.

25:19.231 --> 25:20.765
With everything Breeland shared

25:20.833 --> 25:21.928
about the sheriff's department,

25:21.967 --> 25:23.268
I don't know who I can trust out here.

25:25.871 --> 25:27.991
Let's keep this between us.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.656
Can't hide behind your money now.

25:44.778 --> 25:48.560
Lieutenant Breeland
waved me out of the car

25:48.699 --> 25:53.219
and he ordered me to,
to handcuff the young man.

25:53.859 --> 25:56.468
And I-I attempted to follow his orders.

25:56.719 --> 25:59.226
And did you hear
the young man screaming,

25:59.680 --> 26:03.274
"Somebody call my moms,
somebody call my moms"?

26:03.342 --> 26:04.274
Yes, I did.

26:04.299 --> 26:06.446
And yet we are to believe that
you were the one scared?

26:06.712 --> 26:08.580
Well, he was a bit unstable.

26:08.647 --> 26:10.285
So you think a person
scared for his life

26:10.310 --> 26:11.762
should have a demeanor of stability?

26:11.787 --> 26:13.216
No, I didn't say that.

26:13.241 --> 26:15.535
Was he scared for his life, yes or no?

26:15.560 --> 26:16.821
Answer the question.

26:16.889 --> 26:18.323
Yes or no, Mr. Cox?

26:18.391 --> 26:19.424
Yes!

26:19.492 --> 26:21.593
Yes, he was, as was I!

26:21.933 --> 26:23.595
I was frightened for mine.

26:24.105 --> 26:25.930
And whatever authority

26:25.998 --> 26:28.333
Lieutenant Breeland
was attempting to impose,

26:28.401 --> 26:29.846
all he managed to do was to...

26:30.017 --> 26:33.438
was to get the poor boy
more frightened, more violent,

26:33.506 --> 26:35.540
and he kicked me in my knee.

26:36.111 --> 26:39.544
And I, I-I wanted to discharge my Taser,

26:39.612 --> 26:42.418
and I reached for my gun by mistake.

26:43.739 --> 26:46.217
Yes, I was unstable.

26:49.267 --> 26:50.986
So was he.

26:55.528 --> 26:57.341
My God.

26:57.547 --> 26:58.713
Hey!

27:06.472 --> 27:07.576
Come here!

27:08.908 --> 27:10.675
The hell you running for, Joey?

27:12.311 --> 27:13.678
Y'all like to crack heads.

27:13.746 --> 27:15.280
Got any drugs on you?

27:15.347 --> 27:16.812
I'm not hustling anymore.

27:16.837 --> 27:18.183
So are you a choir boy now?

27:18.250 --> 27:19.818
Are you?

27:19.885 --> 27:21.286
You turn around and put
your hands up there.

27:21.353 --> 27:22.960
- For what?
- 'Cause I asked you to.

27:22.985 --> 27:25.090
- Why? Man, get off me!
- You know the drill!

27:25.157 --> 27:27.859
Somebody call my moms!
You gotta tell me why!

27:27.927 --> 27:28.993
Somebody call my moms!

27:30.379 --> 27:31.930
Stop resisting! Don't you resist me!

27:32.004 --> 27:33.872
- Don't cuff me, man!
- Stop resisting!

27:33.933 --> 27:36.000
- Somebody call my moms!
- Sir!

27:36.068 --> 27:37.435
- Get off me!
- Handcuff him for me.

27:37.503 --> 27:38.670
Please...

27:38.737 --> 27:39.971
You can help cuff him now.

27:41.774 --> 27:43.675
- Roll him over.
- Call my moms!

27:43.742 --> 27:45.510
- Somebody!
- Ow! Ow!

27:45.578 --> 27:46.978
Get off me, man!

27:47.061 --> 27:50.563
Let me go, man, come on!
Somebody call my moms!

27:50.616 --> 27:51.549
Somebody call...

27:55.654 --> 27:57.866
You shot him.
Why the hell'd you shoot him?

27:59.617 --> 28:01.682
Get in the car now.

28:07.357 --> 28:11.220
<i>Somebody call my justice!
Somebody call my justice!</i>

28:11.403 --> 28:13.134
Somebody call my justice!

28:13.228 --> 28:16.704
Somebody call my justice!
Somebody call my justice!

28:16.767 --> 28:18.676
Somebody call my justice!

28:18.744 --> 28:20.411
Somebody call my justice!

28:20.479 --> 28:24.082
Somebody call my justice!
Somebody call my justice!

28:44.669 --> 28:46.470
We, uh...

28:48.044 --> 28:49.941
We presented the best case we could.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.503
Unfortunately,
the grand jury has decided

28:54.528 --> 28:55.802
not to indict Arlen Cox.

29:04.755 --> 29:06.189
To Ms. Campbell,

29:07.193 --> 29:08.841
to all of you...

29:10.302 --> 29:11.857
...I'm sorry.

29:12.398 --> 29:14.232
They're letting a murderer get off,

29:14.300 --> 29:15.934
same as they always do!

29:16.001 --> 29:17.029
Always!

29:17.054 --> 29:18.903
We need to burn this place down!

29:20.206 --> 29:22.188
No! No!

29:22.219 --> 29:23.975
No, damn it, no!

29:24.446 --> 29:27.001
Look, now, some of y'all knew Joey.

29:27.446 --> 29:28.813
Some of y'all never even heard of him

29:28.881 --> 29:31.297
till he got killed,
but you're here, so...

29:31.797 --> 29:33.651
I guess we're all in this together.

29:33.719 --> 29:35.019
We're with you, sister.

29:39.858 --> 29:41.626
We need to step up, y'all.

29:42.645 --> 29:44.713
We need to step up!

29:45.534 --> 29:49.023
They got these cops right here
to make sure we don't act the fool.

29:49.515 --> 29:51.035
But we need to step up

29:51.103 --> 29:54.595
before these cops act the fool
on one of our kids again.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.708
We got to organize.

30:04.027 --> 30:05.795
Y'all want to honor my son.

30:06.785 --> 30:08.519
Y'all want to honor Joey.

30:08.836 --> 30:12.190
We cannot be a reactionary community.

30:12.584 --> 30:15.397
Not no more, y'all. Not no more.

30:17.709 --> 30:20.374
- America doesn't see us.
- We're Americans, too.

30:20.411 --> 30:23.698
The system needs to be
accountable to the people!

30:41.583 --> 30:44.240
- It can't end like this.
- I know.

30:48.537 --> 30:49.789
I know.

30:56.046 --> 30:58.820
How do you propose to bring
the city and state together

30:58.924 --> 31:02.299
when so many people feel
that the system is unjust?

31:02.370 --> 31:04.604
By working with community
leaders, law enforcement,

31:04.666 --> 31:06.473
business owners, and educators.

31:06.541 --> 31:09.743
For example, after deep
reflection on my part

31:09.811 --> 31:11.441
and some number crunching by my team,

31:11.512 --> 31:13.777
we are reinstituting
the education initiative.

31:13.871 --> 31:16.589
That would be the initiative funded
by Cox Group Financial, correct?

31:17.019 --> 31:20.730
The Cox Group will no longer be
affiliated with the initiative.

31:21.003 --> 31:24.064
I've reached out to some members
of the community for support.

31:24.111 --> 31:25.735
It will still be privately funded,

31:26.471 --> 31:28.908
but I believe with an issue as precious

31:28.971 --> 31:30.299
as educating our children,

31:30.369 --> 31:31.921
the character of those who contribute

31:31.999 --> 31:34.007
is as important as the funds
you receive.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You may have just lost

31:36.858 --> 31:38.848
your most valuable campaign donor

31:38.916 --> 31:41.661
just one week before a very
tough election, Governor.

31:41.803 --> 31:44.225
If I'm going to lose,
I'll do so with clean hands.

31:45.961 --> 31:47.628
We put a lot of work into this case.

31:47.696 --> 31:50.431
Let's lick our wounds
and get the next one.

31:50.631 --> 31:52.333
The next one is Sheriff Platt.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.867
You don't have approval to pursue this.

31:53.935 --> 31:56.003
I have evidence given to me
by Deputy Beck

31:56.071 --> 31:58.155
that proves the training records
have been falsified.

31:58.194 --> 32:01.008
<i>The falsified training records
will be blamed on Breeland.</i>

32:01.240 --> 32:03.277
It's time to move on, Mr. Terry.

32:03.467 --> 32:05.943
This is coming
from the Deputy Supervisor.

32:12.794 --> 32:14.537
For whatever it's worth,

32:15.123 --> 32:17.123
I don't get inspired much anymore.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.205
You inspired me.

32:52.694 --> 32:54.828
I believe your husband
may have a storage unit

32:54.896 --> 32:56.731
that could help the police
locate his killer.

32:56.763 --> 32:59.233
- Yeah, we found the key.
- You did?

32:59.301 --> 33:00.778
Yeah, but we don't know the address.

33:00.872 --> 33:02.569
My husband's lawyer asked us about it,

33:02.637 --> 33:05.197
but we felt more comfortable
giving the key to the sheriff

33:05.275 --> 33:07.007
and asking him to look into it.

33:07.075 --> 33:08.212
He just left.

33:08.379 --> 33:09.880
We can call him if you like.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.657
No, no, that won't be necessary.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.173
Thank you.

33:14.349 --> 33:17.683
Mr. Wyatt, any progress
on locating Breeland's storage unit?

33:18.105 --> 33:20.287
<i>You mean the address I left with Akino?</i>

33:21.027 --> 33:23.417
- What?
<i>- At your hotel.</i>

33:23.550 --> 33:25.683
<i>She didn't tell you?</i>

33:25.960 --> 33:28.793
Actually, I... I just missed her call.

33:29.394 --> 33:31.676
If you have the address handy,
can you text it to me?

33:31.745 --> 33:33.115
<i>No problem.</i>

34:05.834 --> 34:08.569
<i>He didn't know
what the hell he was doing out there.</i>

34:08.636 --> 34:10.574
<i>I told him to cuff the kid
and he shot him.</i>

34:10.629 --> 34:12.965
<i>Easy. Take it easy.</i>

34:13.065 --> 34:15.609
<i>As far as you know,
it's a drug-related homicide.</i>

34:16.340 --> 34:17.878
<i>Stick with that story.</i>

34:18.594 --> 34:21.208
<i>Don't deviate under any circumstances.</i>

34:21.275 --> 34:23.071
You got a warrant?

34:25.157 --> 34:26.922
Looks like breaking and entering to me.

34:28.069 --> 34:29.967
Put that weapon on the ground.

34:37.014 --> 34:38.667
He recorded your conversation

34:38.721 --> 34:40.565
because he didn't trust you.

34:41.893 --> 34:43.924
I'm guessing it was for good reason.

34:55.364 --> 34:56.984
Maybe you stood for something once,

34:57.051 --> 34:59.302
but you covered up Joey's murder,

35:00.208 --> 35:02.591
you falsified training records,
and you...

35:03.892 --> 35:05.225
you killed one of your men.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.507
You're going to jail, Sheriff Platt.

35:10.179 --> 35:12.530
Justice isn't won in the courtroom.

35:12.687 --> 35:14.491
It's won in the street.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.346
I'm on the front lines

35:17.289 --> 35:18.812
every day.

35:19.242 --> 35:22.843
And my guys are on the front lines

35:23.324 --> 35:24.843
every day,

35:25.216 --> 35:27.536
and I treat them as my family.

35:31.427 --> 35:33.853
And they're the only family I got.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.126
That's something to stand on.

35:43.728 --> 35:45.400
I'll take that recorder off your hands.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.801
It's evidence.

35:47.869 --> 35:49.533
Inadmissible in court.

35:50.298 --> 35:52.840
Fortunately, we have a
search warrant for this facility.

35:53.492 --> 35:55.198
Your good friend Governor Eamons

35:55.244 --> 35:57.144
helped us sift through the red tape.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.585
Put your weapon on the ground.
You're under arrest.

36:27.921 --> 36:29.795
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.553
Any word from the powers that be

36:35.647 --> 36:37.108
about Platt?

36:37.296 --> 36:41.866
Well, he admitted
to falsifying training records

36:41.934 --> 36:44.398
and to covering up Joey's murder.

36:45.004 --> 36:47.739
But he wants a deal before
discussing Breeland's death.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.992
These guys and their deals.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.576
You know something?

36:55.435 --> 36:57.428
Breeland's gone,

36:58.045 --> 37:00.018
Beck and Platt are locked up,

37:00.638 --> 37:03.221
and I still don't know if we
made Gate Station any better.

37:03.724 --> 37:05.448
You might never know.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.417
We just have to keep trying

39:09.815 --> 39:11.928
Rather than watching from the sidelines,

39:11.975 --> 39:14.485
we need to be active participants

39:14.553 --> 39:15.960
in the pursuit of justice.

39:16.327 --> 39:19.155
There needs to be more of us
in the jury pool.

39:22.282 --> 39:24.183
In order for that to happen,

39:24.393 --> 39:26.549
we need to register to vote.

39:30.323 --> 39:32.787
We have our new friend Sarah Ellis

39:32.834 --> 39:36.615
who is here to help us
organize that effort.

39:39.654 --> 39:40.813
Pastor,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.947
I'd register to vote
if you go run for something.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.351
We can all vote! We can all vote!

39:47.986 --> 39:50.688
I don't like to be put
on the spot like that.

39:54.998 --> 39:58.563
And lastly, I extended an invitation

39:58.630 --> 40:01.532
to one of the deputies
in the sheriff's department

40:02.107 --> 40:04.233
to come talk to us,

40:04.506 --> 40:06.545
and it appears that he's accepted.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.348
Welcome, Deputy Brooks.

40:22.498 --> 40:23.665
Thank you.

40:30.843 --> 40:34.619
As Pastor Janae said, I'm Deputy Brooks.

40:36.045 --> 40:38.506
I know this won't happen overnight,

40:39.451 --> 40:41.506
but I think we should get to know

40:41.573 --> 40:43.215
the people of this community
we're serving.

40:45.793 --> 40:48.930
And I think you should get
a chance to know us.

40:50.301 --> 40:52.002
I love this town.
