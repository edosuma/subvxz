[ Gasping ]

36:48.600 --> 36:51.051
Isabella, I'm sure you
would've done the same thing.

36:52.057 --> 36:53.590
Don't downplay, Maggie.

36:53.731 --> 36:55.764
The guy was
completely psychotic.

36:55.766 --> 36:57.399
I don't know.
[ Chuckles ]

36:57.401 --> 36:59.902
Okay, this is getting heavy.
You got it?

36:59.904 --> 37:01.303
Yeah.
All right.

37:01.305 --> 37:04.473
Hey, Maggie, I, uh,

37:04.475 --> 37:07.076
and I don't care why you had
your spikes taken out.

37:07.078 --> 37:10.246
I really don't. The thing is, I --
I did it for you.

37:10.248 --> 37:12.515
What?

37:12.517 --> 37:15.484
I know you have someone else
now, and I totally get it.

37:15.486 --> 37:17.353
But I realized my decision

37:17.355 --> 37:21.290
had everything to do
with you and...

37:22.792 --> 37:25.828
I just thought
you should know.

37:49.886 --> 37:51.787
Colonel, sir?

37:51.789 --> 37:54.890
If anyone gave out medals
anymore,

37:54.892 --> 37:56.358
you'd sure get one.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.094
What for?
I didn't do a damn thing.

37:59.096 --> 38:01.964
All due respect, sir,
but that's horseshit.

38:01.966 --> 38:05.401
You ran this entire operation
like a puppeteer.

38:05.403 --> 38:08.871
You can't see that, then you're
not half the man I remember.

38:08.873 --> 38:11.707
Well, hell, don't bat
your eyes at me

38:11.709 --> 38:13.709
like some kind of
schoolgirl.

38:13.711 --> 38:16.378
We still got a bunch
of aliens to kill, don't we?

38:16.443 --> 38:18.176
[ Sighs ] Nobody's seen Trevor
on the base.

38:18.178 --> 38:20.612
He just vanished.
He played me. Rookie mistake.

38:20.614 --> 38:22.147
How many sympathetic ears
have we run into

38:22.149 --> 38:23.482
in the last three years?

38:23.484 --> 38:24.783
It's a relief to talk
to somebody

38:24.785 --> 38:26.051
that's not
in the thick of battle,

38:26.053 --> 38:27.486
even if it's just
for a minute.

38:27.488 --> 38:28.720
Ah, good, you're here.

38:28.722 --> 38:30.689
You got this thing
disconnected?

38:30.691 --> 38:32.691
How is it still working
now that you moved it?

38:32.693 --> 38:34.359
We're not sure.

38:34.361 --> 38:36.895
[ Whooshing ]

38:36.897 --> 38:38.964
Whoa.

38:38.966 --> 38:41.166
Guys...

38:41.168 --> 38:44.236
This thing -- my spikes --
it's like it's calling me.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.605
It is an Espheni
communication device.

38:46.607 --> 38:48.373
It would make sense
that Ben Mason's spikes

38:48.375 --> 38:49.908
are reacting to it.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.611
Maybe I can go in
and see what Dingaan saw --

38:52.613 --> 38:53.912
No, no, no, Ben.
That's not safe.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.547
No, not after what
you've been through.

38:55.549 --> 38:57.449
I might be able to translate
what the overlords are saying.

38:57.451 --> 38:59.418
That thing gave Dingaan and me
one hell of a headache.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.686
God knows what
it would do to you.

39:00.688 --> 39:02.087
Yeah, Dan's right.
Absolutely not.

39:02.089 --> 39:03.622
Dad, how many times
have I heard you say

39:03.624 --> 39:05.724
this could be
the final showdown?

39:05.726 --> 39:07.216
Any information I could get --
isn't it worth anything?

39:07.241 --> 39:08.528
It's not worth your life.

39:08.529 --> 39:10.529
Be careful.

Ahh!

39:36.657 --> 39:38.690
No, no.
Ben! Come on!

39:38.692 --> 39:40.726
Get him out!
Get him out --

Oh! Ben!
[ Gasping ]

39:42.963 --> 39:44.763
[ Gasps ] He's burning up.

39:44.765 --> 39:46.198
Dingaan, get him
something to cool him down.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.334
Ben, what did you see?
What'd you hear?

39:49.336 --> 39:50.569
The overlords.

39:50.571 --> 39:53.004
A lot of them.
They were chanting,

39:53.006 --> 39:55.607
like some sort of ritual...

39:55.609 --> 39:58.510
for some higher being.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.312
Higher than an overlord?

40:01.447 --> 40:04.216
Cochise, is there something
you haven't told us?

40:04.218 --> 40:05.784
Uh...

40:08.855 --> 40:11.156
