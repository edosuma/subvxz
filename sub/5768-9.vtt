WEBVTT

00:03.330 --> 00:04.695
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.
Are you all right?

00:04.730 --> 00:06.493
I hope I didn't ruin your suit!

00:06.540 --> 00:08.496
(grunts)

00:08.540 --> 00:10.337
(grunting continues)

00:10.370 --> 00:12.770
What is that?
Calvin Klein?!

00:12.810 --> 00:15.233
(rain continues)

00:15.280 --> 00:16.770
(rain fades away)

00:16.810 --> 00:19.779
(waves lapping, birds squawking)

00:22.490 --> 00:25.118
(indistinct chatter,
gavel banging)

00:25.150 --> 00:26.549
OWEN:
What happened?

00:26.590 --> 00:29.150
O-Okay. O-Okay.

00:29.190 --> 00:32.125
Yeah, I... Iwill tell her.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.720
I love you, Mom.
Good luck.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.762
...you didn't know he had
committed fraud?

00:36.800 --> 00:39.598
_ I've done_ a full
Inventory Since fall.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.666
I resolved to give
investigators my
memos and e-mails.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.666
And you think
that's the extent

00:44.710 --> 00:46.678
of your
responsibility?
Look,

00:46.710 --> 00:48.678
I run a software
company, that's all.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.507
I'm involved in
the big picture,

00:50.550 --> 00:52.541
not all these details.
You mean details

00:52.580 --> 00:55.811
like defrauding the IRS
for $430 million?

00:55.850 --> 00:57.715
BOTH:
Objection!
Yes. Thank you.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.717
In stereo.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.559
Sustained, AUSA Stabler.

01:00.590 --> 01:01.784
Bucky, Your Honor.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.627
Bucky.

01:04.660 --> 01:07.390
You are the CEO
of TaxLaunch.com,

01:07.430 --> 01:10.160
a company that allows
taxpayers to file

01:10.200 --> 01:13.135
onli_ne returns
and to receive onllne refunds.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.536
That's correct.
Two years ago,
you began to file

01:15.570 --> 01:18.232
fraudulent claims
from criminals usmg stolen

01:18.270 --> 01:20.409
Social Security numbers?
We didn't know they
were fraudulent.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.668
Oh, really?

01:21.710 --> 01:22.699
BUCKY:
You sent 86

01:22.750 --> 01:25.241
tax refunds to a single address.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.475
Tax refunds totaling
three million

01:27.520 --> 01:29.647
two hundred and sixty-seven
thousand dollars, all sent

01:29.690 --> 01:31.510
to the same South Side address.
I was

01:31.550 --> 01:32.585
the CEO of a company, sir.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.589
I didn't have time
to check every single envelope.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.281
I trusted the
people under me.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.149
People like...

01:38.190 --> 01:39.498
Dale.
BOTH:
Objection, Your Honor!

01:39.530 --> 01:41.725
Okay, we need
just one lawyer

01:41.760 --> 01:44.661
to object at
a time. Please.
Mr. Stabler

01:44.700 --> 01:47.828
is again attempting to use
our codefendant against us,

01:47.870 --> 01:50.566
and we again ask Your Honor
to sever our two defenses.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.737
As long as they are combined,
the new AUSA

01:52.780 --> 01:55.408
will use us against each other.
JUDGE:
Is that

01:55.440 --> 01:57.772
what you're doing, Mr.... Buclq?

01:57.810 --> 01:59.539
Never, Your Honor.
Your motion is
again acknowledged

01:59.580 --> 02:02.140
and denied.
Your client comes after
us like that again,

02:02.190 --> 02:03.339
we'll come after you.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.414
BUCKY:
This government wiretap,

02:04.450 --> 02:07.157
dated March 3, 2011--
would you listen, please,

02:07.190 --> 02:08.509
and identify your own voice.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.527
WOMAN:
Hello?

02:09.560 --> 02:10.527
MAN:
It's me, babe. You up?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.527
WOMAN:
Yeah, I was just...

02:11.560 --> 02:13.494
Objection, Your Honor.

02:13.530 --> 02:15.896
This is a wiretap of my client
speaking with his wife.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.694
Therefore, it is subject
to spousal privilege.
Your Honor,

02:18.730 --> 02:20.869
Mrs. Foster was
a coconsplrator.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.538
Therefore,
the spousal shield...

02:22.570 --> 02:25.368
Mr. S_tabler can assert
conspiracy all he wants,

02:25.410 --> 02:27.708
but there has been no evidence.
The evidence

02:27.740 --> 02:28.934
is being gathered.
Well, then gather it,

02:28.980 --> 02:30.902
and then submit
the tap.
Stop, stop.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.418
It's gratifying that you
all feel so comfortable

02:33.450 --> 02:36.214
to _talk over each other
In my court, but...

02:36.250 --> 02:37.683
sustained,
Bucky.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.415
This wiretap of the
defendant speaking

02:39.460 --> 02:40.859
with his wife
must not be used.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.653
Bring me evidence

02:42.690 --> 02:44.920
of a conspiracy,
and I'll reconsider.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.881
You're trying
to blame me?

02:45.930 --> 02:48.398
No. I was just
stating a fact.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.762
I was the CEO;
you were the CFO.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.631
I am not going
to jail for you.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.763
Okay, that's enough.
We're on the same side here.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.665
ALICIA: You seem to be
everywhere these days,

02:56.710 --> 02:58.666
Bucky.
Yeah. I got rich,

02:58.710 --> 03:00.632
I got old, got bored.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.807
I thought I'd help
out my Uncle Sam

03:02.850 --> 03:05.648
at the Department of Justice
nail some bad guys.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.318
Like yours.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.840
So we're zero-one.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.484
We'
re.. ?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.784
Zero, one.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.254
Ah, wow. We'll have
to change that, won't we?

03:15.290 --> 03:16.484
Hm.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.679
Alicia.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.698
Owen! Hi!

03:21.730 --> 03:23.425
What are you doing here?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.392
I came to see you
kicking ass.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.569
Wow, you were great
out there, sis. Really.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.807
I haven't done
anything yet.
Well,

03:29.840 --> 03:30.909
take the compliment
seriously.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.532
Look what came.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.469
Ugh! Where's it from?
The Caribbean.

03:35.510 --> 03:36.738
She's getting closer.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.475
Yeah. She's
flying in tonight.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.569
Flying in where?

03:40.620 --> 03:43.441
Uh, here. Home.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.287
Why? Malcolm wants
to see family?

03:45.320 --> 03:47.515
Uh, well, I don't...
I don't think so.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.859
The last time I talked
to her, she said she
had met someone--

03:50.890 --> 03:53.256
Henry from Alaska,
an oilman--

03:53.300 --> 03:55.951
on the last cruise.
Do they even have
oilmen anymore?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.888
Apparently, in Alaska.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.761
Maybe she wants a
divorce from Malcolm.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.405
Maybe she needs
your expertise.
Oh, dear Lord.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.737
So, what's next?

04:03.770 --> 04:05.738
More objections?
I love the objections.

04:05.770 --> 04:08.409
Maybe a few.
There should be some
fireworks after lunch.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.908
Don't you have school?
Mm, it's a furlough day.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.441
One of the great things
about a bad economy.

04:19.590 --> 04:23.321
CARY:
Mr. Saverese.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.952
Nick.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.820
Wow.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.657
What happened to you?
Look at that.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.328
Basketball injury.
Really?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.667
Yeah.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.691
You'll want to get
some ice on that.
Thanks.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.799
Sorry to interrupt
your work here, Nick,

04:35.840 --> 04:39.401
but we have a problem
with this potential suit
against Streckler Automotive.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.374
We do?
Yeah.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.549
I used to work for _
the State's Attorney's office.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.548
Don't know if you knew that.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.071
Anyway... I still
have friends there,

04:48.120 --> 04:51.988
and they came to me,
warning me about this red flag.
And what's that?

04:52.020 --> 04:54.818
Your second in command--

04:54.860 --> 04:57.420
what's his name, Bill?

04:57.460 --> 05:00.452
(jet engine whining overhead)

05:01.500 --> 05:03.821
What about him?
He has a record.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.020
Drugs-- just like you.

05:06.070 --> 05:09.665
And that's why I'm here,
as your lavwer, to warn you.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.769
They'll probably
use that against you

05:11.810 --> 05:13.732
to rebut your lawsuit.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.008
Now, to prepare myself

05:15.040 --> 05:18.100
for these upcoming depositions,
I looked into other legal issues

05:18.150 --> 05:20.846
with your tow trucks--
there were none. Thank God.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.815
Thank God.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.785
But 80 grams of heroine was
found in the trunk of a car

05:26.820 --> 05:29.050
being towed by one of your
tow trucks just last week.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.696
It could look bad for
your lawsuit. (sighs)

05:32.730 --> 05:34.948
And why is that?
Well...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.968
it's a way
to transport drugs.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.992
And the tow truck driver,
he can't be implicated

05:40.040 --> 05:42.099
_ because he was
just movmg the car.

05:42.140 --> 05:45.109
And what do you
suggest I do?

05:45.140 --> 05:47.074
Well, nothing.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.749
That's why I'm here
as your lavwer.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.044
I've looked into everything
there is to know

05:52.080 --> 05:53.718
about your business.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.844
So in case of any trouble,
I'll know what you know.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.142
And I can use my friends at
the State's Attorney's office

05:59.190 --> 06:00.817
to find out more.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.885
I hope I haven't
disturbed you unduly.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.750
It's all been taken care of.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.758
Oh, that's good to know.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.792
And just so you know,
Cary, as your client,

06:09.830 --> 06:12.936
I take this stuff
very seriously.

06:12.970 --> 06:16.963
(jet engine whining)
It's life and
death to me.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.536
BUCKY:
So you speak
very carefully

06:21.580 --> 06:23.548
on the phone with your
workmates, Mr. Foster?

06:23.580 --> 06:25.673
By "careful," do you mean
I had no knowledge

06:27.150 --> 06:29.175
therefore never mentioned
It on the phone?

06:29.220 --> 06:31.188
Yes.
Okay.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.485
Let me play you another wiretap.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.988
DALE:
Hey, Warren. How you doing?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.089
WARREN: Good. Just seeing
what time you're heading out.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.894
DALE:
Well, I think I...
Objection, Your Honor.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.160
You have already ruled
on spousal shield.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.532
The AUSA is attempting
to circumvent...

06:46.570 --> 06:48.959
BUCKY: This is a
completely different
government wiretap

06:49.000 --> 06:51.002
on Mr. Lamborne
and Mr. Lamborne's

06:51.040 --> 06:53.429
live-in boyfriend,
Mr. Warren Nemec.
Mr. Nemec IS not

06:53.480 --> 06:54.936
a "live-in boyfriend."

06:54.980 --> 06:56.129
He is a legally
married spouse,

06:56.180 --> 06:57.807
wed in the
state of...
Vermont.

06:57.850 --> 07:01.047
...Vermont, after that state
legalized same-sex marriage.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.547
Your Honor'_s
already determined

07:02.590 --> 07:04.114
that spousal
shield applies.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.981
Therefore, that same
shield must apply

07:06.020 --> 07:08.716
to Mr. Lamborne's
conversation With
his spouse.
No, Your Honor.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.058
The Defense
of Marriage Act
clearly states that

07:11.090 --> 07:14.150
there is one true marriage,
that between a Iman and a woman.
is

07:14.200 --> 07:16.896
a reactionary law.
Perhaps, but it is
a law, and it's been

07:16.930 --> 07:18.693
on the books since 1996.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.459
_And since there
is no recognition

07:20.500 --> 07:22.764
of same-sex marriage
in the federal courts,

07:22.810 --> 07:24.960
there can be no spousal shield

07:25.010 --> 07:26.932
for Mr. Lamborne.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.969
JUDGE:
Well...

07:28.010 --> 07:29.500
(sighs)

07:29.550 --> 07:31.177
This is a triclq one.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.940
(several talking at once)
No, no,

07:33.980 --> 07:38.189
no, no, no, this one doesn't
go to the loudest arguer.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.814
I will review
precedent on this.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.521
Prepare your briefs and
witnesses for tomorrow.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.549
(bangs gavel)

07:49.970 --> 07:52.530
So, they can't use
the straight couple's wiretap,

07:52.570 --> 07:53.559
but they can use

07:53.600 --> 07:54.567
the gay couple's?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.090
Unless we fight it.
Good.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.938
I'm glad you're doing this, sis.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.001
MAN: Justice Lamb
called an hour ago.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.814
Would you like
to return?
No. Afterward.

08:06.850 --> 08:09.148
I have a dentist appointment
arranged for Thursday.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.889
Does that still work?
No, we'll need
to clear the schedule.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.059
Excuse me,
Mr. Breslow?

08:18.590 --> 08:19.955
Yes?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.525
Excuse me, I...
I heard you speak at Harvard.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.867
It was a highlight

08:23.900 --> 08:25.162
of my time there.
Oh.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.566
I'm Cary Agos.
Jeremy.
This is my assistant,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.659
Hal.
Hey. I'm...

08:29.710 --> 08:32.907
sorry to be...
I'm just so in awe.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.771
Ooh!
May-may I
help you?

08:34.810 --> 08:36.949
Is there something that you...
you need here?

08:36.980 --> 08:39.175
Yes, in fact.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.269
ALICIA:
He's innocent, but he

08:41.320 --> 08:43.288
speaks honestly on the
phone to his spouse,

08:43.320 --> 08:44.742
and it doesn't
look good.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.246
Well, with the other tap
thrown out,

08:46.290 --> 08:47.882
in fact, it looks even worse,

08:47.920 --> 08:49.649
because we don't hear
about the orders

08:49.690 --> 08:50.850
the CEO gives to him.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.858
(door opens)
Then we need
to keep it out.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.697
Hi.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.719
Oh, yeah, from basketball.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.795
Guy caught me with his elbow.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.899
Someone is out in
reception to see you.

09:02.940 --> 09:03.907
Okay. Who?

09:03.940 --> 09:05.999
Jeremy Breslow.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.133
Yes, him, the
Supreme Court
super lawyer.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.707
He's just
sitting out there.

09:11.750 --> 09:15.072
Why?
He wants to see you
about your case,

09:15.120 --> 09:16.610
the TaxLaunch case.

09:16.650 --> 09:18.015
This case? Why?

09:18.050 --> 09:20.689
DOMA.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.654
This ruling could set
precedent for years,

09:22.690 --> 09:24.055
maybe decades to come.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.593
It isn't simply a matter of
your client's innocence

09:26.630 --> 09:29.599
or guilt--
it's a... doorway

09:29.630 --> 09:32.064
to the overturning
of the Defense of Marriage Act.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.829
That's why I'm here--
and that's why

09:33.870 --> 09:35.599
I intend to help you
in court tomorrow.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.006
This is my right hand.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.099
I want you to look at it.

09:40.140 --> 09:43.041
It is with this hand that
I promised my brother--

09:43.080 --> 09:45.947
dying of AIDS-- that I
would defend the rights of gays

09:45.980 --> 09:47.709
to my very last breath,

09:47.750 --> 09:51.049
I would use all my talents,
my strengths, my treasure

09:51.090 --> 09:53.888
to advance the cause of
Stonewall, Harvey Milk,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.114
Lawrence v. Texas,

09:55.160 --> 09:57.025
and now Will Gardner.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.322
Diane Lockhart.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.397
Names that will
mean as much in two
decades as those two.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.897
For we, right here,

10:02.930 --> 10:04.295
right now...

10:06.840 --> 10:08.068
of gay rights.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.866
And all you have to do
is say yes.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.901
Let me help you.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.972
He's full of it.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.147
DIANE:
What? No.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.977
He's Barnum
and Bailey.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.419
He's a liberal lion.
He's a giant.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.042
Who will swallow
this case whole.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.682
It'll all be about him,

10:26.720 --> 10:28.085
not about
the client.
He's also free.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.189
There's another_ reason
we want him.

10:29.220 --> 10:32.087
They just dropped the charges
against our codefendant.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.654
What? When?
Just now.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.191
Without the other wiretap,

10:36.230 --> 10:38.369
they don't have enough
against the CEO.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.038
He'll testify
against us.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.037
Damn it.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.048
Guess who?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.071
Here?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.111
(sighs)

11:00.060 --> 11:02.085
RSagm
for Grace.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.384
WOMAN (in other room):
Oh, that's it. A little more.
A little more. Keep going.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.058
WOMAN:
A little more over there.
That's it, Gracie. You got it.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.692
Oh, Gracie, that's... perfect.

11:08.730 --> 11:09.958
ALICIA:
Hi, Mom.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.729
Oh, Alicia.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.759
Alicia.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.062
Mom.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.465
Your hair.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.036
What are you doing
to your hair?
What?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.139
I like it longer.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.774
I like it shorter.
Oh.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.107
And what's going on here?

11:21.140 --> 11:22.038
The table.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.240
You need to move it over there.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.168
Then you'll have more room.
Grandma bought us presents.

11:25.210 --> 11:26.939
Oh, they've gotten so big.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.049
Zach's taller
than I am.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.172
Happens after two years.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.778
Has it been two years?
No, it hasn't.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.708
And look. Look what I got
you for Thanksgiving.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.818
There's not enough room

11:33.860 --> 11:35.157
in the fridge.
So, Owen tells me

11:35.190 --> 11:36.054
you met someone, Mom.
OWEN:
Um,

11:36.090 --> 11:38.183
actually...
Kids, come here, come here.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.925
Hold me.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.825
(whispers):
Malcolm died.
(gasps)

11:41.860 --> 11:43.088
She brought him
back to bury him.

11:43.130 --> 11:44.927
A stroke while
they were on the cruise.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.938
Oh, Mom. I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

11:46.970 --> 11:48.790
Malcolm was always
such a beautiful man.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.762
So full of life.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.266
Zach, get me my purse, will you?

11:52.310 --> 11:55.108
Uh, Mom's run
into some legal trouble.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.108
Here's the will.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.106
Malcolm left everything to me,

11:59.150 --> 12:00.242
but his son
never liked me.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.417
Mom, this is a subpoena.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.441
Oh?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.185
Yes, for yesterday.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.778
Really? Oh. And...

12:06.820 --> 12:07.855
I got you this book.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.209
You have to read it.
This says

12:09.260 --> 12:10.454
Malcolm's son says
the will is invalid.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.185
They amended it.
Here it is.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.050
Vagina: A New

12:14.100 --> 12:15.158
Biography.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.225
It's very powerful.
Mom,

12:17.270 --> 12:19.397
this says Malcolm
left you nothing.
Oh.

12:19.430 --> 12:22.490
(chuckles)
Well, then I'll really
need you, Alicia.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.906
Owen says you're such
a good lavwer now.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.408
*

12:39.860 --> 12:43.023
I am honored, Mr. Breslow.
Thank you, Judge Friend.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.220
But I am the one honored

12:44.260 --> 12:46.797
to be representing such a fine
young man as Mr. Lamborne.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.855
You're a little crowded over
there at the defense table.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.061
Ben, why don't you get them
an extra table?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.864
Is the government fine with
the addition of Mr. Breslow?

12:53.900 --> 12:54.992
BUCKY:
Of course, Your Honor.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.962
As long as our underdog status

12:57.010 --> 12:58.261
is now formalized.
(chuckles)

12:58.310 --> 13:00.403
The United States as underdog.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.499
I think that's the first time
since the Revolutionary War.

13:02.540 --> 13:03.438
(gallery laughs)

13:03.480 --> 13:07.018
Do you have a first witness,
Mr. Breslow?

13:07.050 --> 13:08.415
And, of course,
by extension, I mean

13:08.450 --> 13:11.908
Ms. Lockhart
and Ms., uh...

13:11.950 --> 13:13.884
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.
I would like to call

13:13.920 --> 13:15.785
former Attorney General,
Arthur Shipton.

13:16.620 --> 13:17.928
MAN:
Do you swear the testimony

13:17.960 --> 13:19.222
you're about to give
is the truth,

13:19.260 --> 13:21.228
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

13:21.260 --> 13:23.069
SHIPTON:
I do.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.068
BRESLOW: What is the United
States government

13:25.100 --> 13:26.226
view of DOMA?

13:26.270 --> 13:28.135
It is the current
United States policy

13:28.170 --> 13:29.592
to not enforce the Defense

13:29.640 --> 13:30.868
of Marriage Act.
I see.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.071
And why is that,
Attorney General Shipton?
BUCKY: Objection.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.270
Former

13:34.310 --> 13:36.369
Attorney General.
Bucky, please.

13:36.410 --> 13:39.243
You may continue.
SHIPTON: Because the
current administration

13:39.280 --> 13:41.168
believes the law to
be unconstitutional.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.586
It is discriminatory
to define a marriage

13:43.620 --> 13:46.180
as only between a man
and a woman.
And therefore,

13:46.220 --> 13:47.585
it would be the opinion

13:47.620 --> 13:49.212
of the government

13:49.260 --> 13:51.478
that Mr. Lamborne
and his husband

13:51.530 --> 13:53.589
are, in fact, legally married,

13:53.630 --> 13:56.224
and that this wiretap
should be excluded

13:56.260 --> 13:58.091
based on spousal shield?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.337
Yes. That would follow.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.634
Thank you, Art, for rushing
over here on such short notice.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.865
No problem, Jer.
I tender the witness,
Your Honor.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.968
Thank you, Jer.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.171
So, Mr. Shipton,

14:08.210 --> 14:11.043
it is the opinion
of the current administration

14:11.080 --> 14:13.048
that the Defense of Marriage Act

14:13.080 --> 14:15.640
_ discriminates _
against same-sex marriage,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.240
and it should not be enforced?

14:18.290 --> 14:19.382
Yes, sir, as I said.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.648
And this would apply to

14:20.690 --> 14:22.282
every level of the government?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.049
Yes, sir.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.626
Social Security benefits?

14:25.660 --> 14:28.925
Well, I will admit the Social
Security Administration

14:28.960 --> 14:30.268
has been slow to modernize.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.427
Meaning that same-sex spouses

14:32.470 --> 14:35.166
_ do not receive _
5006“ Security benefits.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.428
SHIPTON:
That is correct, currently.
BUCKY: What about

14:36.470 --> 14:38.904
federal estate
tax deductions?

14:38.940 --> 14:41.101
Are they available
to same-sex spouses?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.630
No, regrettably.
Spousal

14:42.680 --> 14:45.046
medical benefits
for government employees?

14:45.080 --> 14:47.275
No, not yet.
Medical and
dental insurance

14:47.320 --> 14:49.174
for military spouses,

14:49.220 --> 14:51.040
discounted housing,
surviving

14:51.090 --> 14:52.284
spousal benefits?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.412
Anything?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.416
Again, not yet.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.189
So, let me get
this straight.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.049
The current administration

14:58.090 --> 15:00.297
considers the Defense
of Marriage Act

15:00.330 --> 15:02.093
to be unconstitutional

15:02.130 --> 15:03.222
and discriminatory

15:03.270 --> 15:05.090
and it should
not be enforced

15:05.130 --> 15:06.563
except when it
comes to money.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.636
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

15:08.670 --> 15:12.265
Uh, ma'am, Mr. Breslow
questioned the witness.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.198
Only he is
allowed to object.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.172
Mr. Breslow,

15:15.210 --> 15:16.677
do you have
an objection?

15:16.710 --> 15:18.405
Uh, no, Your Honor. This
is too entertaining.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.270
Don't do that again.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.174
I determine the pace and rhythm
of questioning.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.245
BUCKY:
So, Mr. Shipton,

15:24.290 --> 15:26.611
have you heard
the biblical imperative,

15:26.650 --> 15:30.029
"Where your treasure is,
there your heart will be"?

15:30.060 --> 15:32.153
Yes. Matthew 6:21.
Well,

15:32.190 --> 15:34.329
wouldn't the inaction
of the current administration

15:34.360 --> 15:36.055
on these issues indicate

15:36.100 --> 15:38.159
where their heart really is

15:38.200 --> 15:39.997
on the Defense of Marriage Act?
JUDGE:
Okay.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.065
I'll interrupt there.
Thank you.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.068
You can sit down now, Bucky.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.499
It seems to me
there are mixed Signals

15:46.540 --> 15:49.100
on the constitutionality
of DOMA,

15:49.140 --> 15:51.244
and it is left up
to the individual courts

15:51.280 --> 15:55.171
to decide on the veracity
of a marriage.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.211
So please present me
with evidence

15:57.250 --> 15:58.717
on Mr. Lamborne's
marriage.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.058
(gavelbangs)

16:01.090 --> 16:02.512
DAVID:
Ms. Loy?
Yes?

16:02.560 --> 16:04.152
I'm David Lee,
family law.

16:04.190 --> 16:06.158
Alicia asked that I help
with your probate.

16:06.190 --> 16:07.327
Oh, lovely to meet you.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.248
Would you like some M&M'S?
Oh!

16:09.300 --> 16:10.392
(laughs)

16:10.430 --> 16:11.988
Yes, I-I would, actually.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.397
Ooh.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.429
Thank you very much.

16:14.470 --> 16:15.994
So, you're Alicia's mother?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.007
Yes,

16:17.040 --> 16:18.337
and you're Alicia's boss.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.166
Well, one of them.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.371
I'm so sorry
about your recent loss.

16:22.410 --> 16:24.378
Thank you very much.

16:24.410 --> 16:27.140
Uh, do you think there will be
any difficulty with this?
Depends.

16:27.180 --> 16:30.081
The other claimant says that
you were cheating on his dad--

16:30.120 --> 16:31.712
that's why the deceased
changed his will

16:31.750 --> 16:33.286
to exclude you.
That's a lie.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.185
Unfortunately, a convincing one.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.029
So I've lost then?

16:37.060 --> 16:39.119
Not necessarily.
Why not?

16:39.160 --> 16:40.388
I'm good.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.352
Oh!
(laughing)

16:42.400 --> 16:44.095
My hero.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.360
Will your finances be devastated

16:46.400 --> 16:48.061
if you lose
this probate, Ms. Loy?

16:48.100 --> 16:49.135
Uh, Veronica.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.502
Yes, they will.
Mmm.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.201
Does that matter?
It can.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.309
Destitution plays well

16:54.340 --> 16:55.409
to a COU rt.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.805
This is your
second marriage?
Third.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.308
Really?
I never found anyone

16:59.350 --> 17:00.647
to satisfy me, I guess.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.045
They either bore me or die.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.741
(laughing)

17:03.790 --> 17:05.542
Um...
(chuckles)

17:05.590 --> 17:08.058
Mm. David Lee.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.284
That doesn't sound Jewish.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.287
It sounds Chinese.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.558
Ellis Island.
Oh.

17:11.590 --> 17:14.127
Lee for Liebenbaum.
Oh.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.422
I've always liked Jewish men.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.291
I always thought a penis
never looked quite right

17:17.330 --> 17:18.319
unless it was circumcised.

17:19.370 --> 17:22.430
(chuckling)

17:24.170 --> 17:25.467
Oh!

17:25.510 --> 17:26.534
Excuse me.

17:26.570 --> 17:28.572
So, when are you gonna
make my sister a partner?

17:28.610 --> 17:29.599
Unfortunately,

17:29.640 --> 17:31.449
it all comes down
to who you know,

17:31.480 --> 17:32.708
and Alicia knows so

17:32.750 --> 17:33.478
few people.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.578
Owen.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.678
I thought I'd lost you.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.778
Hello, Ms...?

17:36.820 --> 17:37.787
Loy.

17:37.820 --> 17:38.787
Veronica.

17:38.820 --> 17:39.787
Will Gardner.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.811
And you're a friend of Owen's?

17:41.860 --> 17:43.725
No, I work here.
With your daughter.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.853
Alicia and Will went
to school together, Mom.

17:45.890 --> 17:46.982
Ooh, isn't
that lovely?

17:47.030 --> 17:50.625
My son always talks very loudly
when he patronizes me.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.297
Uh, I saw you two standing
out here laughing,

17:52.330 --> 17:53.558
and I assumed
you knew each other.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.568
We go back a long way.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.737
It's best not to joke with her.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.237
She doesn't understand.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.828
Will and I met
the last time I was here.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.837
Oh.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.131
(elevator bell dings)

18:02.180 --> 18:03.738
WILL: Really?
VERONICA: Yes.

18:03.780 --> 18:06.271
She still swam
the entire race.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.846
(laughing)

18:08.880 --> 18:11.110
Hi, Mom.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.014
Hi, Alicia.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.813
What a lovely mother
you have, Alicia.

18:14.860 --> 18:15.884
Thank you.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.581
She was just
telling us about

18:17.630 --> 18:18.619
swimming class

18:18.660 --> 18:19.649
in third grade.

18:19.690 --> 18:20.896
You got here early, Mom.
Yes.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.522
I thought I'd see
where you work.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.492
And Owen let you talk.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.623
I got here late as well.
Nice work in court,

18:25.670 --> 18:26.796
by the way.
DAVID:
Veronica.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.434
Mm-hmm?
Is that him?

18:28.470 --> 18:30.768
VERONICA:
Yes. That's Malcolm's son.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.607
Didn't skimp
on the lawyer.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.131
Let me do all
the talking, okay?

18:35.180 --> 18:39.173
(all arguing)

18:40.250 --> 18:41.774
Rein in your client!

18:41.820 --> 18:43.139
My client?
He says

18:43.190 --> 18:44.885
that I didn't
love Malcolm. I spent

18:44.920 --> 18:46.342
five years with Malcolm.
You cheated on him,

18:46.390 --> 18:47.652
you were divorcing him!
Is that

18:47.690 --> 18:49.317
what you told your father?
That she was a cheater?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.657
Yes.
DAVID:
And divorcing him?

18:50.690 --> 18:51.884
Yes.
DAVID:
And after that,

18:51.930 --> 18:52.885
he wrote up an amendment

18:52.930 --> 18:53.828
leaving everything to you?

18:53.860 --> 18:54.724
Wait a minute, Brian...
You're damn right!

18:54.760 --> 18:56.398
He was so angry, he
wrote it right then!

18:56.430 --> 18:58.796
Good. Then, sir,
we are suing you

18:58.830 --> 19:01.594
fo_r intentional i_nterf_erence
With expected inheritance.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.403
LAWYER: Oh, come on.
DAVID: You
told your father

19:03.440 --> 19:04.759
a lie to get
him to change

19:04.810 --> 19:06.607
his will.
It wasn't a lie!
She was cheating on him!

19:06.640 --> 19:07.937
Do you have photos?
LAWYER:
Okay.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.833
That's enough.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.370
DAVID: You can't do that!
LAWYER: Brian.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.877
You can't lie to
somebody to get them

19:11.910 --> 19:13.309
to change their will.

19:13.350 --> 19:16.171
We'll be sending over
oursubpoena.

19:16.220 --> 19:17.915
(door shuts)
(chuckling)

19:18.950 --> 19:20.952
You are gonna get everything.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.912
Every cent, Veronica.
(Veronica chuckles)

19:22.960 --> 19:25.849
He told his father you
were cheating on him.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.653
He has no proof.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.464
David, do you have a minute?

19:34.500 --> 19:36.229
My mother...

19:36.270 --> 19:37.601
cheated on him.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.800
How do you know that?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.569
She told my brother.
And your brother told you?

19:41.610 --> 19:42.804
Yes.
And have you told
anyone else?

19:42.840 --> 19:43.807
You.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.738
Then we'll be fine.

19:45.780 --> 19:48.340
But she'll be deposed,
and she'll lie.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.938
She'll be deposed
and she'll tell the truth

19:49.980 --> 19:51.948
as she remembers it, and she
remembers she did not cheat.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.788
My mother remembers things
creatively.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.754
Just don't tell anybody else,
and we'll be fine.

19:57.790 --> 19:58.927
Oh, no.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.497
DALE:
I love Warren.

20:03.530 --> 20:05.498
How do I know?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.464
If he died, I would die.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.592
That's why
you married him?

20:08.640 --> 20:10.767
Not for any tax
or health benefit,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.300
but because
you loved him?

20:12.340 --> 20:13.329
DALE:
Yes.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.369
Shakespeare said,

20:14.410 --> 20:16.002
"A man in hue,

20:16.040 --> 20:18.543
_all 'hues'_in
his controlling."

20:19.580 --> 20:20.945
Warren is that to me.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.811
Thank you.
Tender the witness.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.647
BUCKY:
Well, that was very moving.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.510
You must be very committed
to Warren.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.812
DALE:
I am.
BUCKY: Good.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.851
Sounds like a solid marriage.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.551
What are Free Fridays?

20:32.590 --> 20:34.558
BRESLOW:
Objection, Your Honor.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.249
Relevance.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.927
JUDGE:
I'm not sure how to rule
on that, Mr. Breslow.

20:37.970 --> 20:38.994
How is this relevant?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.931
Well, Mr. Lamborne was
very convincing in his...

20:41.970 --> 20:43.039
Shakespearian portrayal

20:43.070 --> 20:45.004
of a devoted
and happy marriage.

20:45.040 --> 20:48.373
I just want to see how
devoted it really is.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.640
Overruled. You may answer.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.740
What do you mean,
Free Fridays?
You tell me.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.544
You and Warren talked a great
deal about Free Fridays

20:56.580 --> 20:58.013
on one of the wiretaps.

20:58.050 --> 21:01.986
All I want to know is,
what are Free Fridays?

21:02.020 --> 21:03.988
They're date nights.
Oh, I see.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.954
So, you have dinner with
Warren, go to a show.

21:06.990 --> 21:10.562
Wait. Maybe that's not
what you meant.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.989
Who are you dating
on these date nights?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.634
BUCKY:
Mr. Lamborne?

21:17.670 --> 21:18.932
Other people.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.972
BUCKY:
Ah, I see.
So Free Fridays

21:21.010 --> 21:23.035
are free because
you allow your spouse

21:23.080 --> 21:25.640
and your spouse allows you
to have sex

21:25.680 --> 21:27.568
with other men?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.043
(sighs)

21:30.080 --> 21:32.719
Mr. Lamborne,

21:32.750 --> 21:35.310
you must answer.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.920
Yes.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.452
And if Warren were to die
on one of these dates,

21:41.500 --> 21:42.956
would you die, too?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.092
BRESLOW:
Objection.
Argumentative.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.324
Withdrawn.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.496
Tender the witness.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.031
Mr. Breslow, I think
you should see this.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.664
Not now. Nothing
further, Your Honor.
No, Mr. Breslow.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.439
You want to see this now.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.973
We had our investigator
look into the CEO.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.348
BRESLOW:
Mr. Foster, how long
have you been married?

22:00.380 --> 22:01.916
20 years.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.588
And how many affairs
have you had in that time?

22:03.620 --> 22:04.780
Objection, Your Honor!
Relevance.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.812
Mrs. Florrick, would you like
to explain the relevance?

22:07.860 --> 22:09.816
Yes.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.919
Mr. Stabler has questioned
Dale and Warren's marriage

22:11.960 --> 22:13.894
based on their affairs.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.420
We are intending
to show equivalence.

22:15.460 --> 22:20.124
Mr. Foster, please
excuse our impertinence.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.138
How many affairs
have you had?

22:22.170 --> 22:24.058
Oh.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.908
Mr. Foster, it is now
an issue of fact.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.532
Please answer.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.706
(sighs)

22:29.740 --> 22:32.004
Five affairs.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.642
BRESLOW (laughing):
Oh, come.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.113
Remind him
he's under oath.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.845
We have a record of 12.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.848
Okay. Enough.
Thank you.

22:38.890 --> 22:39.914
I'm ready to rule.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.111
It is true

22:42.160 --> 22:44.025
that the courts have been
allowed leeway

22:44.060 --> 22:48.394
to discern whether individual
marriages are legitimate,

22:48.430 --> 22:50.864
but I find the facts here

22:50.900 --> 22:52.822
to suggest nothing more
than equivalence.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.167
Some

22:54.200 --> 22:57.408
heterosexual marriages
are... messy.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.704
Some homosexual marriages
are equally so.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.776
That proves nothing.

23:01.810 --> 23:05.871
DOMA is the law of the land.

23:05.910 --> 23:08.617
That is all I
can depend on.

23:08.650 --> 23:12.518
For that reason, I
must rule the wiretap

23:12.550 --> 23:14.609
is admissible.
(gavelbangs)

23:14.660 --> 23:17.015
So now what?

23:17.060 --> 23:18.755
We lost the battle.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.792
We haven't lost the war.

23:28.470 --> 23:29.960
Mom, you cheated.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.139
You can't say
you didn't cheat when you did.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.138
I didn't cheat.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.068
You know me.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.169
I talked, I flirted.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.748
Malcolm knows I flirt.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.748
His son never liked me.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.587
That is why
he filled his head

23:45.620 --> 23:47.656
with all this... Why
is the TV over there?

23:47.690 --> 23:49.055
Shouldn't it be
in that corner?

23:49.090 --> 23:50.216
I like it over there.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.228
Hmm.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.854
Is this about me being away?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.822
Is what about you being away?

23:56.860 --> 23:58.168
Well, this parental talking-to.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.038
You were away
for two years, Mom.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.765
Malcolm wanted to.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.609
He had the soul of a vagabond.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.234
I called.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.703
I know.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.945
I'm sorry.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.216
I love you.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.455
You know that,
don't you?

24:32.900 --> 24:35.095
You know, you really should read

24:35.140 --> 24:36.630
this vagina book.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.262
She talks about the
profound connection

24:38.310 --> 24:39.959
between the brain
and the vagina.

24:40.010 --> 24:41.705
It really explains a lot.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.640
Sounds great, Mom.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.547
You know, you've gotten
a lot more ironical lately.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.548
Did you know that?

24:48.580 --> 24:50.138
Is it about Will?

24:50.180 --> 24:52.512
What?
Will?

24:52.550 --> 24:54.552
Your boss. Will?

24:54.590 --> 24:56.615
Is that what
this is about?

24:57.660 --> 24:59.821
Oh, my God.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.259
(sighs, sniffles)

25:01.300 --> 25:04.599
Don't get in a fight.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.268
I had to tell her something.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.996
She thought Will was gay,
and he was into me.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.031
So you told her
I slept with him?

25:11.070 --> 25:12.662
No. No, I would
never tell her that.

25:12.710 --> 25:14.735
I told her you had
a crush on him.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.906
Oh!

25:15.940 --> 25:17.544
She thought we were gay!

25:17.580 --> 25:19.309
So, you just say,
"It's none of your business."

25:19.350 --> 25:21.568
Have you ever tried that
with Mom?

25:21.620 --> 25:24.088
It's not his fault, Alicia.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.587
We're family.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.679
We don't hide things
from each other.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.752
DALE:
Well, that's the thing.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.564
I-I don't know
if I didn't do anything wrong.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.090
Okay.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.690
And that was your boyfriend,
Mr. Lamborne, admitting

25:42.740 --> 25:43.934
that he committed fraud?

25:43.970 --> 25:45.631
Objection,
Your Honor.
Sustained.

25:45.670 --> 25:48.537
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Tender the witness.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.876
JUDGE:
Mr. Breslow,
any questions?

25:51.910 --> 25:53.047
Uh, nothing, Your Honor.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.775
Uh, Excuse me, Your Honor.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.708
Could you, uh, give us a minute?

25:56.750 --> 25:57.910
Certainly.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.247
(whispering):
You can't let that stand.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.349
The tap makes it sound like
Dale admitted guilt.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.017
No. The judge is
smart enough to see

26:03.060 --> 26:03.958
he was just being a
conscientious CFO.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.252
Dale, let us cross-examine.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.929
The judge has
to have this underlined.
o.

26:07.960 --> 26:08.858
We underline
at the closing.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.891
Dale, you brought me
on for my experience.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.899
My experience
tells me we wait.

26:15.770 --> 26:18.204
Sorry, Diane, Alicia.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.901
You want him to lose.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.272
I want him to lose?

26:24.310 --> 26:25.846
What are we talking about here?

26:25.880 --> 26:27.245
You want Dale to lose.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.009
You want to take
this DOMA issue

26:29.050 --> 26:31.211
to the Supreme Court,
and you can't do it if he wins.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.387
You can't appeal a win!

26:32.420 --> 26:33.853
This is my right hand.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.858
Oh, don't give me that crap!

26:35.890 --> 26:37.881
I'm here to win.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.628
How many times have you argued

26:41.660 --> 26:43.093
before the
Supreme Court?

26:43.130 --> 26:46.190
How many times have you gone
toe-to-toe with Justice Scalia?

26:48.140 --> 26:50.904
_ _ I don't need
to justify my defense to you.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.029
I am here to win.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.901
I am here to win it all!

26:57.950 --> 27:01.169
Everything.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.745
For all of us.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.916
(door opens and closes,
crowd chatter)

27:10.790 --> 27:12.849
He has answered all
of your questions

27:12.890 --> 27:14.027
completely and honestly.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.288
BUCKY:
So you're saying

27:15.330 --> 27:16.854
it was Mr. Lamborne's idea

27:16.900 --> 27:18.765
to commit this fraud?

27:18.800 --> 27:21.860
Yes. A CEO has to
rely on his CFO,

27:21.900 --> 27:24.039
and I guess Ijust
couldn't rely on Dale.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.129
I'm sorry that makes
you angry, Dale,

27:26.170 --> 27:27.307
but you know it's true.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.331
Thank you. Nothing further.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.677
JUDGE FRIEND
Mr. Breslow, anything?

27:32.710 --> 27:33.779
No, Your Honor.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.913
We'll save our rebuttal
for the closmg arguments.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.089
I have a few questions,
Your Honor.
Ma'am, no.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.179
I have a few questions.

27:41.220 --> 27:44.018
I'm leading the defense,
and I say, no questions.

27:44.060 --> 27:44.981
He just lied about you, Dale.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.692
He was your friend,
and he lied to your face.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.856
BRESLOW:
That's why we wait

27:48.900 --> 27:50.026
for the summation.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.721
No. You answer a lie now,
or it sticks.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.021
Ladies and gentlemen
of the defense?

27:53.070 --> 27:54.389
Just a second, Your Honor.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.998
Dale, we don't want our defense
to seem unorganized.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.166
He wants you to lose.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.031
To him, it's not about you.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.162
It's about the issue.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.804
Where do we stand
over there?

28:05.980 --> 28:07.277
It's a mistake.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.347
Mr. Foster, you testified

28:10.380 --> 28:12.985
that the fraud started
with Dale, not you.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.181
Yes. I trusted him.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.188
Mm-hmm. _
Let me play you this tap.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.324
MRS. FOSTER:
Well, that's not your fault,
Vance.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.021
VANCE:
It is my fault...

28:21.060 --> 28:22.049
if it's discovered.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.022
Excuse me. Objection.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.823
The court has already excluded
this tap due

28:26.870 --> 28:28.360
to spousal
shield laws.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.958
JUDGE:
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,
I thought my ruling was clear.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.104
It certainly was clear,
Your Honor.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.028
When Mr. Foster was a defendant,
the tap could not be played.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.002
But he's no longer
a defendant.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.508
He's a witness, and I am using
this tap for impeachment.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.212
There is no spousal privilege
with impeachment.

28:41.250 --> 28:45.038
That seems to be
eminently clear, Buclq.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.308
Doesn't it?

28:47.350 --> 28:51.059
We would preserve our objection
for the record, Your Honor.

28:51.090 --> 28:53.320
JUDGE:
Please continue,
Mrs. Florrick.

28:53.360 --> 28:57.524
VANCE:
If it's discovered,
the extent of this fraud,

28:57.560 --> 29:01.291
I could find myself
facing a grand jury.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.332
I have been authorized
to offer you four months.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.506
Admission of complicity.

29:09.540 --> 29:14.045
$500,000 in
restitution.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.378
I think you would all
agree that this is

29:16.420 --> 29:19.480
a difficult plea bargain for the
Department of Justice to make.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.556
You have ten hours
to give us a yes

29:21.590 --> 29:23.012
or no.
Thank you, sir.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.527
We'll give it
its due consideration.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.488
(door opening)

29:30.530 --> 29:32.760
Wait till he
turns the corner.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.938
Now.

29:36.970 --> 29:38.528
Congratulations, Dale.

29:38.570 --> 29:41.277
I thought he was going to say,
"Four years."

29:41.310 --> 29:42.402
(laughing)

29:42.440 --> 29:45.204
(elevator bell dings)

29:47.920 --> 29:51.242
Thank you, Mr. Nemec.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.542
I... Do I know you?

29:53.590 --> 29:56.115
No. I, uh, saw you in court.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.821
What you and your husband
are doing--

29:57.860 --> 30:00.351
as a gay man-- I thank you.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.392
You're welcome.

30:03.430 --> 30:05.398
MAN:
Mr. Nemec?

30:05.430 --> 30:07.421
(Dale laughing)

30:07.470 --> 30:08.437
DIANE:
That's fantastic.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.392
DALE:
I still can't believe
this is happening.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.101
I mean, look at me.
I'm still shaking.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.835
Come on, Mr.
Breslow. We won.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.871
No, ma'am, we didn't.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.332
I wouldn't take it, Dale.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.608
You're innocent.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.845
But they're coming after me
for 12 years.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.949
And they have the evidence.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.847
Mr. Breslow,
you have an agenda here.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.482
You have a reason
to reject this.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.351
Tell him.
Gladly.

30:28.390 --> 30:29.379
(door opening)
Uh, come on in.

30:31.490 --> 30:34.527
Your husband has been offered
a four-month sentence

30:34.560 --> 30:36.096
and a half-million-dollar fine.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.859
I can't promise better.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.869
In fact, my guess is,
if Dale doesn't take this plea,

30:40.900 --> 30:43.494
he'll be found guilty.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.508
I take no solace in that.

30:45.540 --> 30:48.179
I just think
you've been treated unjustly.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.371
And you have been treated
unjustly for one reason:

30:50.410 --> 30:51.502
you are gay men.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.917
Now, with clever maneuvers,
we can limit your sentence.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.645
Alicia and Diane--
they're clever.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.181
They can manipulate the law,

30:58.220 --> 30:59.517
and they will succeed,
because they're good.

30:59.550 --> 31:02.314
But the law would not change,

31:02.360 --> 31:06.023
and same-sex couples
would still struggle under DOMA.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.524
You're asking us to lose?

31:09.560 --> 31:12.529
Yes. I'm asking you to force
the court to face its hypocrisy.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.891
We want to take this
to the Supreme Court.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.397
You are two picturesque

31:17.440 --> 31:20.307
upper-middle-class gay men
who can't be dismissed easily.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.501
You are exactly
what we need

31:22.540 --> 31:25.600
to pull Justice
Kennedy to our side.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.072
It's not just
about you anymore.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.646
It's about the entire
gay community.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.446
It's about you two sacrificing
so that we can overturn DOMA.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.121
What do you think?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.590
I don't think
you're gonna like what I think.

31:47.130 --> 31:48.495
I can't believe it.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.269
He's a good salesman.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.403
Okay, it's not over yet.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.375
If they're not taking the plea,
we have one option left.

31:54.410 --> 31:55.638
Winning?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.505
ALICIA:
Owen. Hi.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.972
What are you
doing here?

32:02.020 --> 32:03.214
I've been subpoenaed.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.342
You...

32:07.050 --> 32:08.711
I'll be outside.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.954
Thanks, Cary.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.287
(door closes)

32:12.330 --> 32:14.651
It's Malcolm's son--
they want to question me.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.089
You talked to him
about Mom cheating?

32:17.130 --> 32:18.563
He brought up
Henry the oilman.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.261
I-I said I'd
never met him.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.961
They're gonna ask you
what Mom told you,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.399
and she told you
she was cheating with Henry?

32:23.440 --> 32:26.000
What-what do I do?
I mean, if I tell
the truth...

32:26.040 --> 32:27.667
Then Mom's
perjured herself.
Yes.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.201
And she loses the
inheritance, she
loses everything.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.299
But if you lie,
you're perjuring yourself.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.739
What is that?
That's a Class 3 Felony.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.668
Two to five years.
You're-you're kidding me.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.641
(knocking)

32:37.680 --> 32:39.113
Damn it.

32:39.150 --> 32:40.742
I have to get
to court.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.678
Well, um...

32:42.720 --> 32:44.449
okay, what-what
would you do?

32:44.490 --> 32:47.186
What would I do?
The same thing as you.

32:47.230 --> 32:48.720
You tell the truth.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.661
So you're saying,
Mr. Collegio,

32:53.700 --> 32:55.429
that it is
a fact that

32:55.470 --> 32:56.664
Mr._Lamborne
is innocent?

32:56.700 --> 32:58.463
Yes.
And how do you know this?

32:58.510 --> 32:59.568
I'm the head I.T. guy
at TaxLaunch.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.579
I mean, the, uh,
Chief Departmental
Software Officer,

33:02.610 --> 33:04.703
and I know that the
server went down

33:04.750 --> 33:06.001
during the time
in question.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.712
Mr. Lamborne couldn't
have seen or impacted
the fraudulent

33:08.750 --> 33:10.547
returns in question.
Thank you, sir.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.548
No further questions,
Your Honor.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.353
Just one from me, Your Honor.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.687
Mr. Collegio,
in your opinion,

33:17.720 --> 33:20.188
is our client, Dale
Lamborne, an honest man?

33:20.230 --> 33:21.527
Oh, yes, definitely.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.754
I've known him
for ten years.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.392
I'd trust him
with my life.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.319
Thank you.
Uh, just a few questions,
Mr. Collegio.

33:27.370 --> 33:29.167
So, Mr. Collegio,

33:29.200 --> 33:31.407
you know the client,
Mr. Lamborne, personally?

33:31.440 --> 33:33.761
I do.
Have you ever had
a personal sexual

33:33.810 --> 33:36.176
relationship with him?
Objection, Your Honor.
Beyond the scope.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.701
Your Honor, the defense,
in its questioning
of Mr. Collegio

33:38.750 --> 33:41.719
about Mr. Lamborne's
honesty, used him as
a character witness.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.809
They opened the
door to my questions
about personal bias.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.683
(whispers):
You are really
screwing us.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.587
Just playing
long ball, ma'am.

33:52.790 --> 33:54.758
Did you hear me?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.529
Did I... What?

33:56.560 --> 33:59.222
The tap-- it had
an overhear.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.238
What's an overhear?

34:01.270 --> 34:04.159
When the CEO hung up
after Vance hung up,

34:04.210 --> 34:06.269
there were two clicks
on the Wiretap.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.629
There were two
tap disconnects.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.831
It's not just the feds--
there was somebody else

34:09.880 --> 34:10.608
tapping in.
You're talking

34:10.640 --> 34:12.403
about the two
Wiretaps?
Yeah.

34:12.450 --> 34:13.644
It's not just the feds.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.318
Somebody else
was investigating the CEO.

34:15.350 --> 34:17.818
_Who else would be
investigating Vance?

34:17.850 --> 34:19.715
My guess is State.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.047
You need to subpoena
What they have.

34:21.090 --> 34:25.151
They have to give it to you;
you have an ongoing trial.
Yeah.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.420
Thank you.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.496
(Will chuckles)

34:29.530 --> 34:31.225
I_ wouldn't
he to you.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.489
VERONICA: You really
haven't read it?
Mm-mm.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.394
Well, basically What she says
is that our obsession

34:36.440 --> 34:38.635
with the clitoris
is unhealthy, 'cause...
Mom.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.809
Oh. Hi.
I was just telling Will

34:40.840 --> 34:43.206
about the vagina book
we're reading.
I'm not

34:43.240 --> 34:44.400
reading it.
No, it sounds interesting.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.803
VERONICA: Well,
I'll get you a copy.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.147
You're really not
seeing anyone?

34:47.180 --> 34:48.477
I'm really not
seeing anyone.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.771
Okay, Mom,
right this way.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.185
Talk to you later.
(mouthing)

34:51.220 --> 34:52.778
VERONICA:
I'm getting you that book!

34:52.820 --> 34:55.812
MAN: Shall
we get started,
Mr. Cavanaugh?

34:55.860 --> 34:56.713
Yes, okay.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.479
My client claims
he discussed an affair

34:59.530 --> 35:01.794
between your mother
and another man.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.127
Isn't that true?

35:06.470 --> 35:07.892
No, it's not.

35:07.930 --> 35:09.795
You Hear!
Restrain
your client.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.590
He's the one
who lied.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.699
He's the one who got
the will amended

35:12.740 --> 35:13.900
so that he
could cheat

35:13.940 --> 35:16.170
a poor Widow out
of her property.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.678
(two lawyers speaking at once)

35:21.280 --> 35:23.919
(two lawyers continue arguing)

35:23.950 --> 35:27.442
There were two
Wiretaps, Buclq.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.583
And that should
impress me Why?

35:29.620 --> 35:31.656
Your key witness,
Vance Foster,

35:31.690 --> 35:33.328
he was being
investigated

35:33.360 --> 35:35.328
by State on
embezzlement
charges.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.157
Are you involved
with this?

35:37.200 --> 35:38.269
Involved with what?

35:38.300 --> 35:40.188
Keeping things from
your cocounsel, Ms. Lockhart?

35:40.230 --> 35:42.289
We subpoenaed
a second Wiretap from State.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.365
It gives a clearer picture
of Foster.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.469
DIANE: He bought a yacht--
he admits it in the call

35:46.510 --> 35:47.465
with his mistress.

35:47.510 --> 35:49.239
The yacht came from a kickback

35:49.280 --> 35:50.633
on the fraudulent tax returns.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.178
I'll get back to you.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.448
We're not taking a plea bargain.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.175
On that we
agree, Buclq.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.289
Drop these charges,

35:58.320 --> 35:59.844
or we will present
them in court.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.814
You'll lose, and expose
some embarrassing

36:02.860 --> 36:04.589
interagency confusion.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.721
Like I said,
I'll get back to you.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.867
Congratulations.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.731
Thank you.
You just stuck us

36:18.770 --> 36:21.238
with DOMA for another decade.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.849
(thunder rumbling)

36:31.890 --> 36:36.918
VERONICA: Not a bad oven
for such a small kitchen.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.928
You still grumpy?
Nope.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.450
Well, the turkey's
almost done.

36:40.490 --> 36:44.426
Okay, so, I got
three Whites and two reds.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.722
You think that'll
be enough?

36:46.770 --> 36:48.397
Apparently not.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.566
Have you been talking here?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.534
Mom won her probate fight.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.231
Congratulations.
Your sister thinks

36:53.270 --> 36:54.373
(doorbell rings)
we're liars.

36:54.410 --> 36:55.434
Grace, can you get that?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.698
VERONICA: After the years
I put in with Malcolm,

36:57.740 --> 36:59.401
I deserve that money.
I'm fine.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.441
I didn't say anything.
You don't have
to say anything

37:01.480 --> 37:02.640
with that look
of yours.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.580
GRACE:
Mom! It's Grandma!

37:04.620 --> 37:06.019
The other one!

37:06.050 --> 37:07.984
Oh, dear God.
I didn't know
she was coming.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.511
She's coming.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.549
And Peter, too?

37:11.590 --> 37:14.593
Yep. (sighs)

37:16.460 --> 37:18.496
What is this called again,
Cristian?

37:18.530 --> 37:19.622
Saoco.
(Whispers):
Socko.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.638
Pow._
Saoco is
a Cuban drink.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.989
It just needs ice.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.359
It's perfect
for this weather.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.805
I love these Cuban names.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.035
They're so
tropical.
Happy Thanksgiving.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.877
Welcome.
Have you met
Cristian?

37:30.910 --> 37:33.378
You have a lovely home.
Why, thank you.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.446
Ooh. Let me get some glasses

37:35.480 --> 37:36.515
for this...
Socko.

37:36.550 --> 37:37.517
...socko.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.745
ZACH: Hey, Mom, they're
talking about your case.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.451
I'll be right there.

37:41.490 --> 37:42.912
Mom's in the kitchen.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.428
I'm sure she'd love
to talk to you, Jackie.

37:45.460 --> 37:46.984
(thunder rumbling in distance)

37:48.030 --> 37:49.520
(quietly): Okay.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.822
Only one pill.

37:50.860 --> 37:53.522
And no alcohol.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.867
(quietly):
I cross my...

37:54.900 --> 37:57.437
MAN (on TV):
So, I looked at this case,

37:57.470 --> 37:59.665
and when I saw it,
all I saw was that you were

37:59.710 --> 38:01.735
taking this to
the Supreme Court.
(laughs)

38:01.780 --> 38:04.601
Not every case is built
for the Supreme Court.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.675
Sometimes you
just have to Win it.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.769
And that's What I decided here.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.072
We discussed the possibility

38:11.120 --> 38:14.510
of a... of a test case,
but in the final analysis

38:14.560 --> 38:16.653
Mr. Lamborne's freedom was key.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.681
(chuckling)

38:19.890 --> 38:21.551
(doorbell rings)

38:22.960 --> 38:25.394
Hi.

38:25.430 --> 38:27.625
Hey. Having fun?

38:27.670 --> 38:29.092
Got anything stronger?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.768
Yeah, if we raid
the evidence locker.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.529
Don't tempt me.
Hm.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.673
Oh, Whoa, Whoa, no.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.439
(sighs): Yep.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.641
Oh, Cristian,
brought that.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.511
Oh. What is Saoco?

38:42.550 --> 38:43.812
Ay...

38:43.850 --> 38:46.717
JACKIE:
I'm so glad
you decided to visit.

38:46.750 --> 38:50.618
Zach and Grace were
wondering about their
other grandmother.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.026
I heard you nearly
died, Jackie.

38:53.060 --> 38:56.996
A stroke from helping out
with the kids,

38:57.030 --> 38:59.066
by myself.
Well, at least

38:59.100 --> 39:01.432
you got a young companion
out of it.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.438
How much does
he charge?

39:03.470 --> 39:05.529
$40 an hour.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.367
You should consider it.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.776
You won't have to go begging
for male attention.

39:09.810 --> 39:10.970
Yes.

39:11.010 --> 39:14.002
Paying for it seems
to run in your family.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.711
Hi, Mom.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.479
Hi, Veronica.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.909
Hi, darling.

39:20.950 --> 39:24.113
How are you two doing?

39:24.160 --> 39:26.128
So, how's she doing?

39:26.160 --> 39:27.821
Much better.
Good.

39:27.860 --> 39:30.158
She seems happy.
Yes.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.690
Very happy.

39:31.730 --> 39:33.527
She's a funny lady.

39:33.570 --> 39:35.936
What do you mean by that?
(laughs)

39:35.970 --> 39:38.666
She's funny;
she makes me laugh.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.701
Ah. Well, you've
been spending

39:40.740 --> 39:42.469
a lot of time
with her, huh?

39:42.510 --> 39:45.604
Yeah. She has
extended my hours.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.969
Really?

39:47.010 --> 39:49.114
What... Is that necessary?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.647
No.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.612
(chuckles softly)

39:54.660 --> 39:57.549
* Be sure it's true,
when you say I love you... *

39:57.590 --> 39:59.421
Uh, no, thanks.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.519
* A double sin to tell a lie

40:01.560 --> 40:02.629
* What'd I say!

40:02.660 --> 40:03.957
(thunder rumbling)

40:04.000 --> 40:05.968
(Baroque music playing)

40:06.000 --> 40:08.491
So... he's over
here a lot?

40:08.540 --> 40:10.496
Peter? Sometimes.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.167
And you go over
to his place?

40:14.880 --> 40:18.748
Is this because of me?

40:18.780 --> 40:20.748
Of course, Mother.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.748
Everything is
because of you.

40:22.780 --> 40:25.089
You know What I mean.
You can't let go.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.246
Even as a little kid,

40:26.290 --> 40:29.214
you never could let go of
friends or old schoolbooks.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.718
Even your dad--
you never wanted to
let go of his hand.

40:32.760 --> 40:37.049
And now, there's this
person at work-- Will--

40:37.100 --> 40:39.728
and you want him but you
won't let yourself have him,

40:39.770 --> 40:41.226
because then
you'll be like me.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.761
(thunder rumbling in distance)
(exhales)

40:45.710 --> 40:48.907
I look at you
sometimes, Mom...

40:48.940 --> 40:50.908
and I am just amazed.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.841
I'm happy, Alicia.
I never do anything
I don't want to do.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.019
Are you happy?

40:56.050 --> 40:58.746
Can you say you are?
I can say that I'm living

40:58.790 --> 41:00.781
the life I want.

41:00.820 --> 41:03.789
And I can say there are
a lot bigger things.

41:03.820 --> 41:04.923
No, there aren't.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.123
The older you get,
the more you realize

41:08.160 --> 41:09.957
there's only one thing:

41:10.000 --> 41:11.729
happiness.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.965
(thunder crashing in distance)

41:14.000 --> 41:16.036
(Baroque music continues)

41:29.680 --> 41:31.989
She's never gonna
divorce you, you know.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.659
Hi, Veronica. It's
nice to see you, too.

41:34.690 --> 41:35.987
She's a good person.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.180
You're exploiting her.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.859
How? By not divorcing her?

41:39.890 --> 41:41.653
Yes.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.850
You're leading her on.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.825
Let her go.

41:46.870 --> 41:49.134
What if I don't want
to let her go?

41:49.170 --> 41:50.990
Well, then you're
just being selfish.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.702
(clears throat)

41:53.740 --> 41:55.708
PETER:
Do you need
any help?

41:55.740 --> 41:57.207
Please.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.300
Excuse me... Veronica.

42:00.350 --> 42:02.671
(Baroque music continues)

42:04.990 --> 42:06.946
What do you need?

42:06.990 --> 42:09.208
Don't tell me it's
the bathroom Window again.

42:10.260 --> 42:12.785
(siren wailing in distance)

42:16.230 --> 42:18.562
What are you doing?
Getting undressed.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.022
(thunder rumbling)

42:20.070 --> 42:23.528
Are you serious?
I've never been more
serious in my life.

42:27.770 --> 42:29.704
(gasps)

42:29.740 --> 42:31.708
*
(fire truck horn blowing)

42:31.750 --> 42:33.706
(siren continues wailing)

42:33.750 --> 42:35.115
Door's unlocked.
I don't give a...

42:35.150 --> 42:37.118
(fire truck horn blowing)

42:37.150 --> 42:39.584
(Baroque music continues,
siren fading)

42:39.620 --> 42:40.746
(thunder rumbling)

42:40.790 --> 42:42.087
(panﬁng)

42:42.120 --> 42:44.156
This is about
your mother?

42:44.190 --> 42:46.021
Yes.
