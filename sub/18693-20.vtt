00:05.997 --> 00:07.864
Previously, on Shadowhunters...

00:07.919 --> 00:10.102
I knew there was something
off about Sebastian.

00:10.173 --> 00:11.313
The only thing that
matters right now

00:11.337 --> 00:12.782
is taking Jonathan
and Valentine out.

00:12.806 --> 00:14.549
Your Highness,
I'm here on business.

00:14.589 --> 00:15.760
You don't want things to end
well, do you?

00:15.784 --> 00:17.700
I want change. You want war.

00:17.770 --> 00:19.255
They'll hold the
Institute at bay

00:19.294 --> 00:20.614
while I do what
needs to be done.

00:20.676 --> 00:21.872
I will kill them all.

01:21.133 --> 01:23.800
Mother...

02:17.437 --> 02:19.132
- What's going on?
- Maia's gone missing.

02:19.218 --> 02:20.171
- What?
- She disappeared

02:20.207 --> 02:21.384
from the Hunter's Moon.
And I think your bestie

02:21.408 --> 02:22.648
the Seelie Queen's responsible.

02:24.171 --> 02:25.521
What would the Queen
want with Maia?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.345
She has this crazy
obsession with me

02:27.380 --> 02:28.457
because of the whole
Daylighter thing.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.193
And then she invited me
to live in her court,

02:30.217 --> 02:31.627
and I said thanks but no
thanks, and then she...

02:31.651 --> 02:33.491
she threatened to hurt
the people I care about.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.187
She also offered shelter
to every Downworlder.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.433
That shelter comes with a price.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.158
Loyalty to the Queen.
Maia wouldn't go for that.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.337
And she wouldn't
desert her pack.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.194
Maybe she found a lead

02:43.230 --> 02:44.373
on Valentine and is
off hunting him down.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.130
- Without telling me?
- Come on, Magnus!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.199
We're not making this up.
She's got Maia.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.383
My warlocks are on the roof,
holding up the wards to keep

02:54.407 --> 02:56.374
Valentine in the city.
I have to go help them.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.276
But the next time
I see the Queen,

02:58.311 --> 03:00.211
I will inquire.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.264
Luke, if something happens
to Maia because of me...

03:08.288 --> 03:09.488
I'm not gonna let that happen.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.395
Surely you must be starving.
Please. Eat.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.297
I'll pass on the lamb chops

03:19.332 --> 03:21.232
and get a ride back to Brooklyn.
Now!

03:21.268 --> 03:23.167
That's not very polite.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.203
Why am I even here?!

03:25.238 --> 03:27.438
If you don't feel like
eating, you don't have to.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.407
We can just chat.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.643
Tell me about the Daylighter.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.178
Simon?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.480
We don't have to play pretend.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.215
You know him well.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.218
He's quite fond of you.
As you are of him.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.288
And how do you know that?

03:43.323 --> 03:45.323
My eyes and ears are everywhere.

03:46.359 --> 03:49.260
But there are certain things
only a girlfriend would know.

03:49.296 --> 03:52.497
The Downworld is on the
brink of annihilation

03:52.532 --> 03:54.232
if Valentine gets to that lake.

03:54.301 --> 03:57.602
As much as I would love to
talk to you about Simon,

03:57.637 --> 03:59.570
I really need to get back.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.607
I assure you, dear,
you are perfectly safe here.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.242
I'm not talking about me.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.979
I'm talking about my pack.
My friends.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.746
Patience.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.183
Right...
patience isn't really my thing.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.196
Take her to the wander-woods.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.603
- Anything new?
- We tried tracking him together,

04:32.639 --> 04:35.440
like we did with Jonathan,
but for some reason it didn't work.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.541
Magnus's wards are up,

04:36.576 --> 04:38.409
Valentine must still
be in the city.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.179
Thank the Angel for
Magnus and the warlocks.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.591
They didn't raise
the wards for us.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.216
Teams are out doing
block by block sweeps

04:45.251 --> 04:47.218
throughout the city.
We'll find him.

04:51.877 --> 04:53.944
Hey... you OK?

04:55.428 --> 04:57.128
I thought I'd be relieved

04:57.163 --> 05:00.131
when Jonathan was finally dead.
But...

05:00.166 --> 05:01.366
actually, I feel worse.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.403
I get it. He was your brother.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.344
Aerial sensors.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.148
Is it Valentine?

05:17.183 --> 05:19.417
No. Could be some
kind of wraith demon.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.102
- Where is it?
- It should be

05:38.138 --> 05:39.203
right on top of us.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.245
I've never seen a
demon like that.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.384
On your six!

05:58.458 --> 06:00.191
Can you see it?

06:05.398 --> 06:06.609
What the hell is it waiting for?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.232
It's coming around
for another pass.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.278
Relax. I got this.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.583
Nice.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.156
HEY!
He threw something at my car!

06:33.426 --> 06:34.525
Over there!

06:36.162 --> 06:37.361
They're splitting up!

06:50.915 --> 06:52.644
Your Majesty, look who we found.

06:54.503 --> 06:55.602
I assumed you would return,

06:55.637 --> 06:57.504
but why is the wolf here?

06:57.539 --> 06:59.539
- He wasn't invited.
- Where is she?

06:59.575 --> 07:02.609
- Safe and sound.
- Let her go... Now.

07:02.644 --> 07:04.711
What's the hurry?
She's perfectly fine.

07:04.746 --> 07:06.580
Take off your coat. Stay awhile.

07:06.615 --> 07:08.648
Stay awhile?
Have you forgotten that Valentine

07:08.684 --> 07:11.318
is still on the loose?
Every wolf in the city

07:11.353 --> 07:12.564
is looking for him,
which is why I'm struggling

07:12.588 --> 07:15.422
to understand why
you're wasting time

07:15.457 --> 07:17.290
kidnapping werewolves
when you should be out

07:17.326 --> 07:18.446
trying to find him yourself.

07:23.432 --> 07:24.664
Unless you already found him.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.430
Is that what happened?

07:28.770 --> 07:30.370
You made a deal with Valentine?

07:30.405 --> 07:32.339
He wanted to get past the wards.

07:32.374 --> 07:33.518
So you gave him
passage to Idris?

07:33.542 --> 07:35.408
I wanted to protect my people,

07:35.444 --> 07:37.310
even those outside the
safety of my realm.

07:37.346 --> 07:40.213
We Seelies understand
the power of negotiation.

07:40.249 --> 07:42.282
Your idea of negotiation
is putting the rest

07:42.317 --> 07:43.317
of the Downworld at risk.

07:43.352 --> 07:44.629
Which is just fine by
you, isn't it?

07:44.653 --> 07:46.586
That way,
you can rule it all by yourself.

07:46.622 --> 07:49.422
You flatter me, Lucian.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.391
I'm not just telling my wolves.

07:51.426 --> 07:52.637
I'm gonna tell the
entire Downworld.

07:52.661 --> 07:54.628
And when they find
out how you betrayed

07:54.663 --> 07:56.596
- each and every one of us...
- Go ahead,

07:56.632 --> 07:58.231
I have nothing to hide.

08:00.402 --> 08:01.534
In the meantime,

08:01.570 --> 08:03.370
I would like to
have a conversation

08:03.405 --> 08:04.405
with the Daylighter.

08:10.093 --> 08:11.544
I need to find Maia.

08:15.651 --> 08:18.351
At least four demons are
still unaccounted for.

08:18.387 --> 08:20.420
Notify all available personnel.

08:22.357 --> 08:23.468
What's wrong? Is everything OK?

08:23.492 --> 08:24.624
That was Luke.

08:24.660 --> 08:26.393
Valentine's on his way to Idris.

08:26.428 --> 08:27.494
- What?
- How?

08:27.529 --> 08:29.329
He made a deal with
the Seelie Queen.

08:30.365 --> 08:31.576
Luke's warned all the
other Downworld leaders.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.565
Damn Valentine.

08:32.601 --> 08:34.366
If Valentine gets
to that lake...

08:34.403 --> 08:37.203
He won't. Malachi's army is
armed and waiting for him.

08:37.239 --> 08:38.337
We need to warn him.

08:38.373 --> 08:40.217
Who knows how many Circle
Members will be there?

08:40.241 --> 08:41.619
If we lower the wards,
these demons can get out.

08:41.643 --> 08:43.275
Spread beyond the city.

08:43.312 --> 08:45.211
Maybe we don't
have to lower them.

08:45.247 --> 08:47.414
Maybe my portal rune
can pierce the wards.

08:48.483 --> 08:51.318
We can't all go.
The demons need to be dealt with.

08:52.521 --> 08:54.387
Clary and I'll go.

08:54.423 --> 08:56.289
You two stay here,
slay the beasts.

08:57.693 --> 08:59.259
Fine. Be careful.

08:59.294 --> 09:01.695
Likewise.
And when am I ever not careful?

09:19.348 --> 09:20.547
Where's the army?

09:20.582 --> 09:22.382
We're still a hike
away from Lake Lyn.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.484
I guess my navigation's
still off.

09:26.288 --> 09:27.487
We need to hurry.

09:27.522 --> 09:29.489
We can't let Valentine
reach the lake.

09:30.525 --> 09:32.592
He nearly ran me over!

09:32.627 --> 09:36.329
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on!

09:37.632 --> 09:39.399
Report that to the others
and get back to me.

09:39.434 --> 09:41.512
There's over 50 of them now,
with numbers increasing.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.303
And they haven't attacked once.

09:43.338 --> 09:44.482
- What are they doing?
- I don't know,

09:44.506 --> 09:46.651
but demons don't usually come
into our realm to sight-see.

09:46.675 --> 09:49.449
We need to find the rift where
they're coming from and seal it.

09:49.711 --> 09:51.378
We'll need a warlock for that.

09:51.413 --> 09:52.645
Not just any warlock.

09:52.681 --> 09:54.414
The most powerful
one in New York.

09:54.449 --> 09:56.716
Magnus is not interested in
helping the Shadowhunters.

09:56.752 --> 09:58.752
- He said so himself.
- He still also thinks

09:58.787 --> 10:00.732
the Seelie Queen is on their side.
He needs to know

10:00.756 --> 10:02.355
about the deal she
made with Valentine.

10:02.391 --> 10:03.423
Well, not from me.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.569
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

10:04.593 --> 10:06.393
Don't make this personal, Alec.

10:06.428 --> 10:07.460
I'm not!

10:08.885 --> 10:10.284
If you don't ask him, I will.

10:13.568 --> 10:15.301
Izzy, wait.

10:24.746 --> 10:26.479
Magnus.

10:27.516 --> 10:28.659
What do you want, Shadowhunter?

10:28.683 --> 10:30.483
Is it about the demons?

10:30.519 --> 10:31.729
There's something
you need to know...

10:31.753 --> 10:34.354
- about the Queen.
- Well, if you've come

10:34.389 --> 10:35.733
to tell me that she made
a deal with Valentine,

10:35.757 --> 10:37.590
I already know.

10:37.626 --> 10:39.292
Wait!

10:41.763 --> 10:43.496
Izzy has located the rift

10:43.532 --> 10:44.609
that the demons are coming from.

10:44.633 --> 10:47.467
Oh, and you want me to seal it.
What a surprise.

10:48.503 --> 10:50.503
We need a warlock to
seal one this severe.

10:50.539 --> 10:52.405
- Duh.
- The demons don't discriminate

10:52.441 --> 10:54.340
between Downworlder,
Shadowhunter, mundane.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.376
They kill them all.

10:59.481 --> 11:00.944
I'll seal the rift.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.516
But not because of you
or the Shadowhunters.

11:03.552 --> 11:05.351
Because it'll save lives.

11:16.765 --> 11:19.299
We need you on this side, here.

11:25.407 --> 11:26.407
On my way.

11:30.345 --> 11:31.644
Consul Malachi.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.646
Jace Herondale of the
New York Institute.

11:33.682 --> 11:34.647
Clary Fairchild.

11:34.683 --> 11:35.782
I know who you are.

11:35.817 --> 11:37.617
Valentine is on his
way to Lake Lyn.

11:37.652 --> 11:39.519
- He has the sword and the cup.
- Yes,

11:39.554 --> 11:41.354
I'm quite aware of
Valentine's progress.

11:42.724 --> 11:44.724
We need to get to the water.
Now.

11:44.759 --> 11:46.626
I'm afraid that's
not gonna happen.

11:48.563 --> 11:50.396
You're a Circle member!

11:52.467 --> 11:54.267
You can't!

11:54.302 --> 11:55.468
Let me go!

12:18.213 --> 12:19.868
Whoa. Whoa. You are not allowed

12:19.931 --> 12:21.064
in the Wander Woods.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.750
Where is she?

12:25.786 --> 12:26.818
Tell me where she is!

12:26.853 --> 12:29.421
I do not know precisely.

12:29.456 --> 12:30.488
The woods are vast.

12:30.524 --> 12:32.524
Not to mention
dangerous for a...

12:36.701 --> 12:38.730
Reinforce the seals...

12:46.406 --> 12:47.784
Do you have any idea
how many speeches

12:47.808 --> 12:49.574
I've heard Malachi give?

12:49.610 --> 12:51.543
How many times I've heard him...

12:51.578 --> 12:55.380
preach loyalty to Clave above
all else under the Angel?

12:55.415 --> 12:56.781
And all along he's...

12:56.817 --> 12:59.584
he's been working with
our greatest enemy.

12:59.620 --> 13:03.488
How does the Consul,
the leader of the entire Clave,

13:03.523 --> 13:04.756
end up a Circle member?

13:04.791 --> 13:07.592
Valentine threatened to
wipe out any Shadowhunters

13:07.628 --> 13:09.561
who opposed him.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.730
Malachi's just trying
to save his own ass.

13:11.765 --> 13:14.499
And sit back while everything
around him is destroyed.

13:19.706 --> 13:21.339
How could you side with him?

13:21.375 --> 13:23.775
There is only one side.
The side of the angels.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.411
Valentine is only doing
what the Clave has been

13:26.446 --> 13:28.346
trying to accomplish
for centuries:

13:28.382 --> 13:29.781
eradicate demons.

13:29.816 --> 13:32.751
No. No! The angels
would never be in favor

13:32.786 --> 13:34.753
of killing millions of
innocent Downworlders

13:34.788 --> 13:36.621
along with demons.

13:36.657 --> 13:39.290
When Raziel created
the first Shadowhunter,

13:39.326 --> 13:41.459
there was no such
thing as Downworlders.

13:41.495 --> 13:45.296
But over the centuries,
disgusting half-breeds emerged.

13:45.332 --> 13:49.567
Warlocks, vampires,
Seelies, werewolves.

13:49.603 --> 13:52.737
They banded together,
grew more powerful.

13:52.773 --> 13:55.707
Finally they will be destroyed.

13:55.742 --> 13:57.342
And so will you.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.419
I just spoke with Imogen.

14:07.454 --> 14:09.499
Despite her requests,
there have been no troop movements

14:09.523 --> 14:11.356
in and out of Alicante since.

14:11.391 --> 14:13.369
When she went to Malachi
to see what the holdup was,

14:13.393 --> 14:15.493
she was told he'd left suddenly.

14:15.529 --> 14:18.763
So she believes Consul Malachi
is actually a spy for Valentine?

14:18.799 --> 14:20.699
There is no other explanation.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.801
Jace and Clary are in
Lake Lyn with Valentine,

14:22.836 --> 14:25.570
who knows how many Circle
Members and no military support.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.439
We need to go help them.

14:28.475 --> 14:30.375
I can't leave when the
city is under assault.

14:32.579 --> 14:33.778
What have you got?

14:33.814 --> 14:37.382
We've identified the demons as
a rare sub-species of Edomei.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.384
- Edomei?
- You're familiar with them?

14:39.419 --> 14:41.586
They're from Edom.
Tenacious little devils.

14:41.621 --> 14:44.489
- So we've noticed.
- And remarkably intelligent,

14:44.524 --> 14:47.659
capable of creating carnage
in any number of ways.

14:47.694 --> 14:50.628
Yet they haven't attacked once.
What are they waiting for?

14:50.664 --> 14:52.297
They work in hordes.

14:52.332 --> 14:53.710
Perhaps they're
increasing their numbers

14:53.734 --> 14:55.400
to reach a critical mass.

14:55.435 --> 14:57.955
All the more reason to get this
rift closed as soon as possible.

14:58.705 --> 15:00.672
Their entry-point
appears to be here,

15:00.707 --> 15:02.674
near Croton Point.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.742
How long will this take?

15:03.777 --> 15:06.444
Jace and Clary are alone
in enemy territory.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.779
Not long.

15:07.814 --> 15:08.814
We need to move.

15:13.653 --> 15:15.386
This is definitely
the right place.

15:16.456 --> 15:17.555
What is that?

15:18.592 --> 15:19.657
Blood.

15:19.693 --> 15:21.626
Where did all the demons go?

15:21.661 --> 15:23.361
I'm not sure.

15:23.396 --> 15:25.797
They just don't normally
fly off into the sunset.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.687
Well, let's not stick around
until they make an appearance.

15:30.704 --> 15:33.538
The amount of energy required
to seal a rift from Edom

15:33.573 --> 15:36.307
is substantial.
It's not just a flick of the wrist.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.679
You gonna be OK?

15:43.316 --> 15:45.416
I'm the High
Warlock of Brooklyn.

16:04.604 --> 16:06.437
GO! I'm all right!

16:07.340 --> 16:08.540
Cover me!

17:02.729 --> 17:04.494
Magnus! Magnus.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.301
You can't get rid
of me that easily.

17:31.744 --> 17:33.000
Maia, where the hell are you?

17:34.068 --> 17:36.068
- Luke!
- Maia?

17:39.181 --> 17:41.147
- You alright?!
- They took me out here!

17:41.183 --> 17:43.227
I've just felt like I've been
wandering around here forever...

17:43.251 --> 17:45.051
Maia!

17:45.087 --> 17:46.286
You came too.

17:48.123 --> 17:50.423
Simon is quite valiant
and chivalrous,

17:50.459 --> 17:53.059
unlike any of the other Night
Children I've ever known.

17:56.264 --> 17:57.464
You're all free to leave.

18:00.369 --> 18:03.079
My servant will escort you
out of the Court to safety.

18:06.475 --> 18:08.341
What's the catch?

18:08.377 --> 18:10.276
What makes you
think there is one?

18:10.312 --> 18:11.378
Luke, let's just go.

18:11.413 --> 18:14.080
Nothing here ever
comes for free.

18:14.116 --> 18:16.027
You never do anything out of
the kindness of your heart.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.261
Hell, you were gonna sell
the entire Downworld...

18:17.285 --> 18:19.052
Let's just get out
of here while we can!

18:19.087 --> 18:21.354
She's a smart one.
You should listen to her.

18:21.390 --> 18:23.123
Before I change my mind.

18:25.327 --> 18:26.327
Come on.

18:38.006 --> 18:39.205
It's gonna be OK.

18:39.241 --> 18:40.241
How?

18:41.343 --> 18:43.343
Your father won't approve...

18:43.378 --> 18:46.346
but he'll understand your deaths
were a necessary sacrifice.

18:46.381 --> 18:48.048
For mass genocide?

18:48.083 --> 18:51.051
You're the Consul of the Clave.
How can you let this happen?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.253
Cleanse the world of demons?

18:53.288 --> 18:55.288
How can I not?

18:55.323 --> 18:56.990
- Proceed!
- NO!

20:00.455 --> 20:02.388
Wait... please... wait!

20:08.230 --> 20:10.497
Are you OK?! You're OK?

20:12.334 --> 20:13.466
We have to go.

20:17.506 --> 20:19.339
Any word from Jace and Clary?

20:19.374 --> 20:22.475
No. But they should be
arriving at Lake Lyn by now.

20:22.511 --> 20:25.545
Strange. The aerial sensors
show no demonic activity.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.313
Yeah. There's nothing
on the ground either.

20:27.349 --> 20:29.249
It's like the Edomei
completely disappeared.

20:29.284 --> 20:30.517
I never heard of that.

20:30.552 --> 20:33.186
Once they pass through the rift,
the demons are here to stay

20:33.221 --> 20:34.298
until they're properly banished.

20:34.322 --> 20:35.522
Then where the hell are they?

20:48.236 --> 20:49.469
Are we too late?

20:51.239 --> 20:54.073
No. No, if he'd raised the
Angel, we'd know it.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.510
We beat him here.
We can stop him.

21:06.254 --> 21:08.421
I'm sorry, son...

21:08.456 --> 21:10.323
I had to.

21:13.495 --> 21:15.395
Alexander, you OK?

21:26.107 --> 21:27.307
His parabatai rune.

21:29.177 --> 21:30.543

24:26.247 --> 24:28.380
Just in time to see
history being made.

24:28.416 --> 24:29.615
You killed Jace...

24:29.650 --> 24:31.450
How could you?

24:31.486 --> 24:34.064
I'm certain he would have
stopped me if I hadn't.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.455
Clarissa, I loved that boy.

24:36.491 --> 24:38.290
Like I loved Jocelyn.

24:38.326 --> 24:40.459
See, their deaths were
necessary sacrifices,

24:40.495 --> 24:42.361
if I'm going to save humanity.

24:42.396 --> 24:44.497
Don't lie to me.

24:45.533 --> 24:48.267
You've never loved
anyone but yourself.

24:53.508 --> 24:54.573
If that were true,

24:54.609 --> 24:57.543
then why do you think
I've kept you alive?

25:33.681 --> 25:36.482
Raziel, hear me!

25:40.321 --> 25:42.388
I call upon the
Mortal Instruments

25:42.423 --> 25:45.124
and summon you into
this mortal realm!

26:00.241 --> 26:01.540
We're too late.

26:03.177 --> 26:04.343
He's raised the Angel.

26:04.378 --> 26:06.378
Magnus,
you need to get to safety.

26:06.414 --> 26:08.347
We need to find Jace and Clary.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.220
Your stele.

26:14.255 --> 26:16.522
It has been a thousand years
since I was last summoned

26:16.557 --> 26:19.558
to this place.
Why do you summon me now, Nephilim?

26:19.594 --> 26:24.163
My Lord Raziel,
the great men and women in the lineage

26:24.198 --> 26:25.676
of Shadowhunters,
which you have created here,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.633
have failed in their mission

26:27.668 --> 26:30.336
to rid this world

26:30.371 --> 26:32.271
of demon scum.

26:32.306 --> 26:35.474
I see you are impatient.
What is it you ask of me?

26:35.509 --> 26:39.278
The immediate death of all
evil-blooded creatures,

26:39.313 --> 26:41.447
demon and Downworlder alike,

26:41.482 --> 26:44.383
as well as the disloyal
Shadowhunters...

26:44.418 --> 26:46.252
who protect them.

26:46.287 --> 26:48.498
The destruction of the souled
creatures of the Downworld,

26:48.522 --> 26:51.457
and of our own Nephilim?
That is not Heaven's wish.

26:51.492 --> 26:52.458
What?

26:52.493 --> 26:54.426
But thou who spills thy blood

26:54.462 --> 26:57.296
thou shalt compel
from me an action.

27:38.139 --> 27:39.305
I've worked too long.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.572
I've sacrificed too much...

27:40.608 --> 27:42.541
to let anyone stand in my way.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.478
Even my own daughter.

27:47.348 --> 27:48.514
No...

28:39.300 --> 28:41.133
Angel-blooded one...

28:41.168 --> 28:43.135
I don't want
Downworlders to die.

28:43.170 --> 28:44.410
Please, you can't let them die!

28:44.438 --> 28:46.305
I want another wish.

28:46.340 --> 28:49.441
You may compel me to one
action, Clarissa Morgenstern.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.477
What is it that you ask?

28:53.581 --> 28:55.147
You know my name.

28:55.182 --> 28:57.282
Concern yourself not
with what I know.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.385
But rather, what can be.

28:59.420 --> 29:03.288
If you have a desire, ask me now.
And be wise.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.524
I will grant but one.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.264
Jace...

29:15.469 --> 29:19.304
Bring Jace back. Please!

29:36.490 --> 29:37.623
Jace?

29:39.393 --> 29:41.226
Jace?

30:00.614 --> 30:01.647
Are you OK?

30:01.682 --> 30:03.582
Oh my God.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.522
What happened?

30:10.558 --> 30:12.558
You're alive.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.628
Valentine raised the Angel.

30:16.664 --> 30:19.198
I used the wish
to bring you back.

30:20.634 --> 30:22.514
You could have had anything
else in the world...

30:24.238 --> 30:25.270
and you chose me.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.573
I don't want anything
else in the world.

30:29.310 --> 30:31.643
Bringing people back...

30:31.679 --> 30:34.213
there's always a consequence.

30:34.248 --> 30:36.615
Not this time.
This is a miracle.

30:38.252 --> 30:39.585
OK? It's... a gift.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.221
Granted by the Angel.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.539
They're OK!

31:01.575 --> 31:03.375
Actually, they're more than OK.

31:05.546 --> 31:07.246
Jace I...

31:07.281 --> 31:09.214
I thought you were dead.

31:10.484 --> 31:12.651
Our rune... it disappeared.

31:15.087 --> 31:16.355
Look at it now.

31:22.563 --> 31:23.563
How?

31:26.500 --> 31:28.300
I don't know.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.242
It's over.

31:38.379 --> 31:39.545
Yeah.

31:58.030 --> 31:59.663
To the Downworld!

31:59.698 --> 32:01.455
To the Downworld!

32:01.533 --> 32:03.470
To the Shadowhunters!

32:03.517 --> 32:05.068

32:06.938 --> 32:09.017

I really wish Max was here.

32:09.174 --> 32:10.573
I know, but the important thing

32:10.609 --> 32:12.308
is... he's gonna be OK.

32:12.344 --> 32:15.245
He has an amazing family
to look out for him.

32:16.381 --> 32:18.281
And so do I.

32:18.316 --> 32:20.250
You know,
I grew up surrounded by brothers,

32:20.285 --> 32:22.118
who I love with all my heart.

32:23.221 --> 32:26.222
But deep down, I've...
always wanted a sister.

33:27.152 --> 33:28.296
Double O-Neg for the gentleman.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.286
Gentleman. Nobody calls me that.

33:31.623 --> 33:33.590
So... you have to tell me.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.225
Uh, tell you what?

33:35.260 --> 33:37.193
Why the Seelie
Queen let us all go.

33:38.807 --> 33:42.365
I told you!
Because I'm extremely persuasive

33:42.400 --> 33:43.466
when I want to be.

33:44.502 --> 33:46.169
Come on, I'm serious.

33:46.204 --> 33:48.104
So am I.

33:48.139 --> 33:50.139
I mean, I'm not going
to go making up a story

33:50.175 --> 33:52.141
to the girl that I'm...

33:52.177 --> 33:54.377
you know... dating.

34:01.519 --> 34:03.353
I wish I could stay...

34:03.388 --> 34:06.155
but I have to go
back to the DuMort.

34:06.191 --> 34:07.357
Raphael wants me to, uh...

34:07.392 --> 34:09.570
you know, fill the vamps about
everything that went down.

34:09.594 --> 34:11.226
OK. Call me tomorrow?

34:11.263 --> 34:12.295
Yeah, totally!

34:12.330 --> 34:14.464
♪ Under night ♪

34:16.467 --> 34:18.134
♪ You and me, coming down ♪

34:18.168 --> 34:19.435

34:21.273 --> 34:23.239

34:30.248 --> 34:32.215
Yeah, we do, don't we?

34:32.250 --> 34:34.117
You and Clary look good
together, too.

34:34.152 --> 34:36.185

34:38.156 --> 34:39.156
Hey!

34:40.358 --> 34:42.190

34:42.226 --> 34:44.327
You look like you
got your energy back.

34:44.362 --> 34:47.362
My go-to home remedy after
a major magic-depletion...

34:47.399 --> 34:50.500
boiling hot bath,
eight ounce steak, medium-rare

34:50.534 --> 34:53.268
and... a lot of these.

34:53.304 --> 34:56.139
♪ The darkness inside of you ♪

34:56.174 --> 34:58.074
Any sign of demons?

34:58.109 --> 35:01.210
None. Sensor maps are completely
clear of wraith demons.

35:01.246 --> 35:03.179
It's the strangest thing.
It's like they...

35:03.214 --> 35:05.381
disappeared into thin air.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.350
Well then we can
take this moment.

35:07.385 --> 35:09.285
To celebrate.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.160
Can we talk?

35:18.229 --> 35:19.229
Yeah.

35:39.384 --> 35:40.450
Magnus, I'm sorry.

35:40.485 --> 35:42.118
Don't apologize.

35:42.153 --> 35:43.297
No, I should've told you
about the Soul Sword.

35:43.321 --> 35:45.121
It's in the past.

35:49.094 --> 35:52.061
Magnus, ever since our... fight,

35:52.097 --> 35:53.329
I...

35:53.365 --> 35:55.331
I can't...
I can't think straight.

35:58.236 --> 36:01.204
Well, I can't do anything
without thinking of you.

36:01.239 --> 36:03.306
Magnus, I...

36:05.276 --> 36:06.756
I don't think I can
live without you.

36:14.219 --> 36:16.539
I thought I had to choose,
between you and the Downworld...

36:19.324 --> 36:20.324
but I don't.

36:22.127 --> 36:24.527
A wise man once told me...

36:24.562 --> 36:26.295
relationships take effort.

36:27.332 --> 36:29.198
Yeah.

36:29.234 --> 36:30.554
Well,
that was an understatement.

36:34.272 --> 36:36.239
You know what's not
an understatement?

36:51.089 --> 36:53.222
I'm... all into parties, but...

36:53.258 --> 36:54.658
what do you say we
get out of here?

36:56.394 --> 36:57.394
Yes.

37:04.169 --> 37:05.368
There you are.

37:05.403 --> 37:06.502
Hey.

37:08.206 --> 37:09.472
So, um...

37:09.507 --> 37:11.307
Today, at the lake,

37:11.342 --> 37:14.177
when Alec asked you about dying.

37:15.513 --> 37:17.180
Why didn't you tell
him what happened?

37:19.350 --> 37:21.417
Some things are just
better left unsaid.

37:25.290 --> 37:26.556
Is something wrong?

37:28.293 --> 37:29.293
No.

37:29.327 --> 37:31.194
No! I mean, look.

37:31.229 --> 37:32.261
Look around.

37:32.297 --> 37:33.496
You know, we did it.

37:33.531 --> 37:35.531
We won.

37:35.567 --> 37:37.033
Everything's good.

37:37.068 --> 37:39.135
Just, uh...

37:39.170 --> 37:42.104
Just for now, can you...
can you keep this between us?

37:43.408 --> 37:45.274
Yeah. Of course.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.375
Thank you.

37:46.411 --> 37:49.178
Clary! Ha ha ha! Come here!

37:49.214 --> 37:51.147
- Hi!
- Get in here!

37:51.182 --> 37:52.448
Oh, there we go!

37:54.252 --> 37:56.552
- Jace! Come on, bring it in!
- No. Oh, no.

37:56.588 --> 37:59.055
- No?!
- No. Wet dog, man. Wet dog.

37:59.090 --> 38:00.367
- I'm sticky, I know.
- You are sticky.

38:00.391 --> 38:02.391
I am coming back for
you, though.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.293
I will come for you, son.

38:06.397 --> 38:07.397
Oh...

38:10.168 --> 38:12.502
The sign outside said private
party, so I used your name.

38:14.506 --> 38:18.174
- Ollie, this is a private party...
- We need to talk.

38:19.444 --> 38:21.077
Sure, OK.

38:21.112 --> 38:22.389
Well, sure. What do you...
what do you want to talk about?

38:22.413 --> 38:25.081
I was wondering...

38:25.116 --> 38:27.116
how long have you
been a werewolf?

38:52.210 --> 38:53.610
I knew you were a
man of your word.

38:55.413 --> 38:57.480
For better or for worse.

38:57.515 --> 39:00.316
We are going to have
so much fun together.

39:31.549 --> 39:35.351
Ahh! AHH! Ah...

40:21.232 --> 40:22.331
Oh...

40:26.504 --> 40:29.138
I'm here now, son.
