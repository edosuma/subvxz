WEBVTT

00:13.138 --> 00:16.349
Ms. Teagues,
are you chewing gum?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.351
Yeah.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.604
Where does gum go
when you enter this classroom?

00:21.688 --> 00:24.858
Wanda the Waste Basket!

00:26.901 --> 00:29.029
Okay.
All right, come on,

00:29.029 --> 00:30.572
my future little
Odd Futures.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.032
Time to go back
to our classroom.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.576
Uh, come on, guys.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.619
You'll see Ms. Davis
next week.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.289
Hey, guys.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.915
I know music class
is fun,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.792
but that's why we have to let
someone else have a turn.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.879
All right, guys,
you know what?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.172
Don't make me collect
the recorders,

00:47.172 --> 00:48.590
'cause if I collect them,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.300
who knows when
you're gonna see them again.

00:51.760 --> 00:58.016
<i>♪ That saved
a wretch like me</i> ♪

00:58.016 --> 00:59.517
<i>I once was lost... ♪</i>

01:13.114 --> 01:14.366
JANINE
So sorry I'm late.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.825
Oh, glad you guys started
without me.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.868
We weren't waiting.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.244
This isn't a restaurant.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.205
Uh, why are you late?
Is everything okay?

01:20.205 --> 01:21.539
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.083
The kids just love
Ms. Davis' class,

01:23.083 --> 01:24.876
so it takes a while
to get them back,

01:24.876 --> 01:26.336
and then everything
runs a little late.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.588
You know, normally,
I'd be bothered by my kids

01:28.672 --> 01:30.882
being obsessed with
another teacher, but I get it.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.093
- My class? Also Davis devotees.
- Mm.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.721
Only way she could be cooler is
if she were related to Angela.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.765
Not that I think
all black people are related.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.183
Well, maybe you do.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.893
Maybe that was
your subconscious speaking.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.687
What would
Angela Davis think?

01:43.687 --> 01:46.272
Well, my suggestion
to all of you

01:46.356 --> 01:48.983
is to enjoy your free periods
while you can.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.903
Because music class
will be going bye-bye-bye

01:51.903 --> 01:54.072
like Blackstreet
Boyz II Men.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.741
Mm, mnh, no.
Wrong in like three ways.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.243
Whoa. What's happening
to music class?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.662
Well, the school pays
for the music class

02:00.662 --> 02:02.247
out of discretionary funds.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.041
And since Ava lost her dirt
on Superintendent Collins

02:05.125 --> 02:06.918
when he married
the <i>goomah,</i>

02:06.918 --> 02:08.753
there's no way
he's gonna fork over the cash

02:08.837 --> 02:10.005
like he has
for the last three years.

02:10.005 --> 02:13.758
No more of the glitz and glam
you lot have become used to.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.719
It's gonna go right back
to the lean years.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.178
Mm-hmm.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.596
Then what are these?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.307
There has to be a way to
convince Superintendent Collins

02:21.391 --> 02:23.226
that we still need
that discretionary money.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.812
Well, all the principals have to
present their cases for funding

02:25.812 --> 02:27.439
to the school board
at the end of the week.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.065
How do you always know
this stuff?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.358
I told you all this
many times --

02:30.442 --> 02:31.526
I trained to be
a principal.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.528
- Mm, it's not ringing a bell.
- Mm.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.239
I interned at the
Baltimore School Board
for two summers.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.324
I got my Master's
in Educational Leadership,

02:38.408 --> 02:40.535
and I went through a program
specifically meant

02:40.535 --> 02:43.038
to encourage young black men
to become principals.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.664
So do I think
that Ava can learn

02:44.748 --> 02:46.374
everything that
she needs to know by Friday?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.001
No.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.712
Out of curiosity, what was her
presentation like last year?

02:50.712 --> 02:52.964
She played a chopped and screwed
version of Tom Cruise saying,

02:53.048 --> 02:54.549
"Show me the money,"
on repeat.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.468
And no one asked any questions
when that worked?

02:56.468 --> 02:57.552
I'm sure
she is preparing,

02:57.552 --> 02:59.304
given the circumstances
have changed.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.140
"They keep telling me
I've aged out of <i>The Bachelor,</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:04.851
so that's why I need to borrow
your birth certificate, Ava,

03:04.851 --> 03:06.770
exclamation mark."

03:08.772 --> 03:11.900
Even in a world
where Ava could put together

03:11.900 --> 03:13.693
- a competent presentation...
- Mm-hmm.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.278
...it still does not change
the fact

03:15.362 --> 03:18.323
that the Superintendent
can't stand her

03:18.323 --> 03:20.533
and, by extension, us.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.160
The nerve on that guy.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.745
Yeah, well,
maybe this will be the year

03:23.745 --> 03:26.623
where the school board
finally awards me

03:26.623 --> 03:29.709
that Advancement Grant
that I have been applying to

03:29.793 --> 03:31.544
for 10 years.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.006
They will
if we make them.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.177
Just, like, a little...
gentle arm-twisting.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.597
A little arm twist
never hurt.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.849
This is so exciting.
Oh, my God.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.267
I'm gonna go to the mall
right after school

03:46.351 --> 03:47.811
and get a new shakedown sweater.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.732
Do I even wanna know?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.317
I don't know.
Do you?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.111
You know you have
a presentation

03:56.111 --> 03:57.445
to the school board
coming up, right?

03:57.529 --> 03:58.905
Yeah,
I do it annually.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.033
Right, but you're ready for
the one this year?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.244
This girl doesn't know
what "annually" means.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.286
No, I know what it means.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.122
It's just that this time
is a little different.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.665
Yeah, my job
is on the line.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.544
More importantly, discretionary
funds for the entire school.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.421
Yeah, but those two things
kinda go hand in hand

04:14.421 --> 04:15.755
- if you really think about it.
- Great.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.965
So you're taking it
seriously, then.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.008
As a heart attack.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.385
I haven't watched
<i>Love After Lockup</i>
in like a month.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.428
Free Puppy.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.430
Can I see
the presentation?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.514
You don't have a lawyer,
do you?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.933
No. Oh, not unless
you count that guy

04:27.017 --> 04:28.393
that represented me
in that hit-and-run.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.687
I was clipped
by a delirious jogger.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.439
Then I'll show you
the presentation tomorrow.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.441
There's a lot of proprietary
technology involved.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.651
Sign this NDA

04:36.735 --> 04:38.862
and bring it back
in the morning.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.281
Don't look at them.
They've already signed.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.742
Oh. Okay.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.410
I found a connection
at the school board.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.911
Ooh,
you got a guy there?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.038
No, you do.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.457
Delisha Sloss.
She goes to your church.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.792
My guy says she's on the finance
committee or something.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.252
I know her.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.546
- One of our shadier members.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.382
But God's light finds
even the shadows.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.634
Yeah, she's up to something.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.970
Being able to spot ops
runs in the family.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.599
That's how we Schemmentis got
so successful in...business.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.768
I don't think so.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.354
Oh, come on!
It's an easy squeeze.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.731
She's been skimming cash
off the top for years.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.275
It's not that
I can't handle it.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.693
It's just that...

05:18.777 --> 05:21.029
I'm not used to playing
in the mud.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.365
I leave that to
people like you.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.412
People like me, huh?

05:30.872 --> 05:33.708
Your signed NDA.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.210
- That's a cute shirt.
- Oh, thank you.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.544
I got it from Old Navy.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.796
It would look much better
on me.

05:37.796 --> 05:38.838
You know what?
Give it to me.

05:38.922 --> 05:39.964
No. What?

05:40.048 --> 05:41.466
Look, can we just
start already?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.468
I wanna finish this before
the kids get here at 7:30 --

05:43.468 --> 05:44.844
6:00 -- 7:30.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.347
This presentation
is about to blow your mind.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.141
Let's get started.
Ava 2, Ava 3.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.937
Oh! What?!

05:57.524 --> 05:59.192
What the hell?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.237
- <i>-
- Success.</i>
- Greatness.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.321
<i>Passion.</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:05.990
And what do all those words
have in common?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.575
- <i>-
- Ava Coleman.
- Ava Coleman.</i>

06:07.659 --> 06:10.370
So, in conclusion, a school
with such an amazing leader

06:10.370 --> 06:12.622
is an obvious choice
for discretionary funds.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.998
And what school is that?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.127
<i>A.</i>

06:17.127 --> 06:18.461
B. <i>- B.</i>

06:18.545 --> 06:19.629
Okay. <i>- O.</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:21.047
That's enough. <i>- T.</i>

06:21.131 --> 06:22.298
L. Janine,
you're throwing off my timing.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.425
<i>- E.</i>
- Enough.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.136
<i>M -- M -- M --
M -- M -- M --</i>

06:26.136 --> 06:28.096
- What?
- You couldn't let me finish?

06:28.096 --> 06:29.639
No --

06:29.723 --> 06:31.266
Ow!

06:31.266 --> 06:33.018
So, what do you think?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.020
I think...

06:35.020 --> 06:38.440
I don't think this is what
the school board is looking for.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.484
Damn it!

06:41.568 --> 06:42.902
I knew it.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.279
I thought
I could just hit 'em

06:44.279 --> 06:45.822
with the ol'
razzle-dazzle.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.283
These are the parts
about being a principal
that I'm not good at.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.202
Interesting. What parts
would you say you are good at?

06:51.286 --> 06:52.954
This isn't the time for jokes, Janine.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.040
This is the first time in
my life that I won't be able to

06:55.040 --> 06:57.333
charisma my way
out of the situation.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.337
This is the first job
that I've liked in my life.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.380
I don't wanna lose it.

07:03.715 --> 07:07.385
Okay. Well, what if we find
a way to combine your charisma

07:07.469 --> 07:09.846
with what the school board
is actually looking for?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.598
That's the point --
I don't know.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.891
I'm not some nerd,

07:12.891 --> 07:14.726
got somebody showing me
the ropes and giving me advice

07:14.726 --> 07:17.270
and putting up
with my near-constant hijinks.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.064
Okay. You're right.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.899
We need to find someone
who knows

07:20.899 --> 07:22.942
what presentations like this
should look like.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.196
I know how you feel
about Ava

07:26.196 --> 07:27.530
and the whole
principal situation,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.199
but this is
for the kids.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.658
It feels like
it's for Ava.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.536
Yeah. But it'd be
for all of us, too.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.081
I mean, say they fire Ava.
Then what?

07:36.081 --> 07:38.541
They bring in
some micromanaging control freak

07:38.625 --> 07:39.959
who won't let us
do our jobs?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.503
Yeah,
we wouldn't want that.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.963
Look, I know she may not be
our best option,

07:44.047 --> 07:46.508
but she certainly isn't
the worst.

07:46.508 --> 07:50.762
Fine. But if she refers to me
as a food item, I'm out.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.348
Great. Meet me
in the library at lunch.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.849
<i>-
Did he say yes?</i>

07:54.933 --> 07:56.184
<i>'Cause otherwise,
I found a livestream</i>

07:56.184 --> 07:58.978
<i>of some other school board's
presentation that might help.</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:01.272
<i>Never mind.
It's an</i> SNL <i>skit.</i>

08:01.356 --> 08:03.733
Since I've been here,
Ava's biggest improvements

08:03.817 --> 08:05.944
to the school include renaming
- the Wi-
- Fi network

08:05.944 --> 08:07.445
Bad Bitches Only

08:07.529 --> 08:10.490
and using field-trip money
to put 26-inch rims

08:10.490 --> 08:11.825
on one of the buses.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.202
Is it how I'd do the job?
No.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.746
But the school does deserve
to have this money.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
Very good.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.375
Oh, I like that.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.876
Repo's here.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.004
Hey, Melissa.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.130
You need something?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.673
Yeah, I'm just here
to repo this rug

08:26.673 --> 08:29.134
since you got it
from a mud person.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.802
Wait.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.930
Is this because
I won't extort a church member?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.473
You are overreacting.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.183
No, I'm just trying to
protect you.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.438
I wouldn't want you involved in
any of my immoral activities.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.605
You need some help?

08:42.689 --> 08:43.940
Nah, I got it.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.442
Okay. So, she should start
by showing them

08:45.442 --> 08:46.651
our student retention rates.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.736
They've been steady
since the appeal

08:47.736 --> 08:49.029
for a student recount
was filed.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.989
Yes, Ava counted twins
as one student

08:50.989 --> 08:52.991
because she said they share
the same soul.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.869
That's true.
And this is so boring!

08:55.869 --> 08:57.120
And I don't like
this shift

08:57.120 --> 08:58.872
in the power dynamic
where you're in charge.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.248
You've never been
less attractive.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.332
Look, we have to
build a case

09:01.416 --> 09:03.334
to get the discretionary funding
with data and facts.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.794
Well, then this
is pointless.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.546
I've spent my whole life
avoiding those two things.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.424
Look, what if we just write down
exactly what she needs to say,

09:09.424 --> 09:10.842
and then she can
just read it?

09:10.842 --> 09:12.010
I wish I could
just read something,

09:12.010 --> 09:13.845
but this superintendent
is out to get me.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.805
He's gonna be throwing curves
like that lady gym.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.267
Okay.
Then we have to keep trying.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.643
This is our only option.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.604
Unless you want to catch
Superintendent Collins

09:22.604 --> 09:23.938
cheating again.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.774
Yes!
Let's focus on that.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.108
That's got to be easier.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.986
Maybe the best thing for
the school in the long run

09:30.070 --> 09:32.655
is for her to fail
and they get a new principal.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.325
Not necessarily me.
Just a new one.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.162
Who...is like me.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.123
And that is one of the many ways
that <i>My Octopus Teacher</i>

09:42.207 --> 09:44.834
made me, well,
believe in love again.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.046
Is everything okay?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.839
The only time I saw
you two sit apart

09:49.923 --> 09:51.841
is when Melissa said you should
put sugar on grits.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.218
There's nothing
to talk about.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.886
Yeah, 'cause it's very straightforward.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.722
We're under attack, and she's
got her head buried in the sand.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.849
Better the sand
than the mud.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.810
Okay. You refusing
to cooperate

10:01.810 --> 10:03.645
doesn't stop bad things
from happening.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.855
We should be using
people doing bad stuff

10:05.939 --> 10:07.524
to do good stuff
for our kids.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.402
Mm. "The only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

10:10.402 --> 10:12.195
is for good men
to do nothing."

10:12.195 --> 10:14.781
You know, usually when
you quote stuff, it's annoying

10:14.781 --> 10:17.367
and I want you to shut up,
but in this case, very relevant.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.827
Oh, thank you.
I have another.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.495
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.501
What are y'all doing here?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.461
You didn't think we would
give up that easy, did you?

10:28.545 --> 10:29.754
That's exactly
what I thought.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.297
I'm genuinely surprised
to see you.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.049
Okay. So, you know how
your presentation

10:33.133 --> 10:34.342
used those robotablets?

10:34.426 --> 10:35.552
My assistants, yes.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.887
Well, what if we were
your assistants?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.931
That way, we can handle
all the data and graphs,

10:40.015 --> 10:42.350
and you can handle
the showmanship.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.476
I love it!

10:43.560 --> 10:45.186
This is like a group project
at school

10:45.270 --> 10:46.980
where I bring the energy,
and you guys bring

10:46.980 --> 10:49.315
whatever doesn't require
a personality.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.401
This is a good idea.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.163
Okay. I know you said
that you're okay,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.040
but I can tell that
you're not by the way
that you're gardening.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.541
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.168
Oh!

11:08.168 --> 11:10.879
Oh, J-J-Jacob,
I'm sorry.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.464
I'm -- I'm --
I'm fine, really.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.549
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm good.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.509
Oh.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.803
Tsk. Oh.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.972
I know
we need the money.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.184
And I have applied for
that Advancement Grant

11:24.184 --> 11:26.811
for 10 years now.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.564
I just don't want to compromise
my morals to get it.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.902
Look, while I admire that you've
applied 10 years in a row,

11:33.902 --> 11:35.653
have you heard
that saying

11:35.737 --> 11:37.906
about the definition
of insanity?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.657
Have you ever heard
the saying

11:39.741 --> 11:41.534
that I will pop you
upside your head

11:41.618 --> 11:43.328
if you imply
that I am insane?

11:43.328 --> 11:44.829
I'm just saying...

11:44.913 --> 11:46.122
...you did something
you wouldn't normally do

11:46.206 --> 11:47.832
by starting
this garden with me.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.584
That didn't turn out so bad,
huh?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.010
- Hey.
- Thought I was early.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.679
You are. I'm just earlier.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.763
Ava here yet?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.640
She's probably somewhere
doing power poses.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.100
Actually,
it's been a minute.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.476
Let me check and make sure
she hasn't bolted.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.103
Mm-hmm.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.444
Gregory Eddie, right?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.570
Yeah.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.239
It's good to
see you again.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.908
You know, I'm sorry I couldn't
hire you as principal, but...

12:21.908 --> 12:23.743
my hands were tied.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.578
- To the bed?
- Pardon?

12:25.662 --> 12:26.746
Nothing.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.749
Look, if you're still interested
in being principal,

12:29.833 --> 12:32.544
I think maybe some positions
might be opening up,

12:32.544 --> 12:34.004
even at Abbott.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.006
So...

12:36.006 --> 12:38.675
if you're interested...

12:38.675 --> 12:40.593
e-mail me.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:46.850 --> 12:50.979
Look, there's Delisha Sloss --
if anybody cares.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.981
Excuse me.

12:57.402 --> 13:01.239
Okay. So, after Gregory talks
math competency,

13:01.239 --> 13:02.615
I'll handle
the attendance graph,

13:02.699 --> 13:04.451
and then I'll kick it to you
for testing numbers.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.453
So, I'm the grand finale.
But what if they want an encore?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.246
That's okay.
We'll handle all surprises,

13:08.246 --> 13:09.956
and all you have to do
is take care of the lobs.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.083
Oh, perfect!
I'll go into a power pose.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.878
And remember, you don't wanna
show too much improvement

13:14.878 --> 13:16.296
because then they think
we won't need the money.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.339
But then, also,
you don't want to show

13:17.339 --> 13:18.715
that we haven't gotten
any better,

13:18.715 --> 13:20.675
because then they think we're
not capable of improvement.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.677
Wow. And this is the job
you really want?

13:22.761 --> 13:24.262
- Sounds gross.
- Yeah.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.139
Ah, Principal Coleman.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.141
Superintendent Collins.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.518
I'm really looking forward to
showing you our presentation.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.062
W-What do you mean
"our"?

13:32.062 --> 13:33.980
I've enlisted two
of Abbott's best teachers

13:34.064 --> 13:35.398
to help me with
the presentation --

13:35.482 --> 13:37.150
our shortest
and our finest.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.736
No, you're not slick.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.030
You'll be giving today's
presentation alone.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.578
Uh, oh, my God.
What did he just say to you?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.497
That if you don't do well,
you're gonna get fired?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.956
Worse.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.792
He mumbled
and I didn't hear it.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.512
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.930
Mrs. Sloss.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.932
I'm a teacher
at Abbott Elementary.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.850
I believe we go to
the same church.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.227
Oh, how lovely.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.937
I think
I've seen you around.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.856
Of course you've seen
Deacon Wiley's new hairstyle.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.276
Oh, he's got it dyed, fried,
and laid to the side.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.113
Yes, it's funny
when people look bad.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.740
Um, uh...

14:25.824 --> 14:28.368
Sister Sloss, God is good,
is he not?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.620
- He is.
- And He knows in our hearts

14:30.704 --> 14:33.331
whether we are good people
or not.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.834
I imagine he does.
You have a good day, now.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.502
Well, while I have
your attention,

14:37.502 --> 14:41.256
you are on the Church Finance
Committee, aren't you?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.513
Our test scores
have been good.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.516
But not too good.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.727
And definitely not bad.

14:53.727 --> 14:57.772
Uh, the same goes for
our attendance rates.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.608
They have been exactly where
they should be

15:00.692 --> 15:04.988
to inspire confidence while also
leaving room for improvement.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.198
Any questions?

15:07.282 --> 15:08.700
Never mind.
There's no time for questions.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.411
I still have, uh,
13 more slides.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.499
I can't really
hear anything.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.209
Okay, get away from the door.
Let me try.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.089
Yeah, I can't hear anything, either.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.716
Who's got
the biggest ears?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.179
I -- I'm-a just...

15:29.179 --> 15:30.638
I'll get a glass.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.645
When I'm overwhelmed,
I get on my phone, too.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.938
I like to read the news.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.273
You know, seeing something
way worse

15:40.357 --> 15:43.401
than what's happening
to me really puts
things in perspective.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.904
Yeah, I was just sending
an e-mail, but...

15:45.904 --> 15:47.530
I can do that later.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.325
By the way, thank you so much
for helping.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.868
I know it isn't easy
to coach someone

15:51.868 --> 15:53.870
who has the job
you should've gotten.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.164
Yeah, well, it's a lot easier to
say yes to things

15:56.164 --> 15:58.166
when you're the one asking.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.168
Oh.
Well, in that case,

16:00.168 --> 16:02.128
can I get a burger
and a Nintendo Switch?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.384
How do you think
it's going in there?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.969
Oh, I think it's probably
going well.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.014
I think it's going w--

16:13.098 --> 16:14.599
I think it's probably
going well.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.934
Hmm.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.144
And that brings me
to my last chart...

16:20.647 --> 16:22.190
What are we
looking at here?

16:22.190 --> 16:25.610
Well, there's no words on it,
but...it's going up!

16:25.694 --> 16:28.321
That can't be too bad.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.156
Or too good!

16:30.240 --> 16:32.701
Based on what you've shown us
so far,

16:32.701 --> 16:35.704
what metrics are
your funding targets keyed to?

16:35.704 --> 16:38.123
Thank God
you brought that up.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.418
I was like, "I hope he asks
about Target and whatnot,"

16:41.418 --> 16:43.169
- 'cause I have another slide --
- You know what?

16:43.253 --> 16:45.672
I thi-- I think we've seen
all we need to see here today.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.132
Thanks for coming in.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.759
- But I -- I --
- Look, that's your time,

16:49.843 --> 16:51.845
not even including
the five minutes you took

16:51.845 --> 16:53.471
when you got a paper cut.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.684
Look, I know you all
want me to talk

16:57.684 --> 17:00.228
about pie charts
and cake graphs,

17:00.228 --> 17:02.564
but that's not
the entire story.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.233
Yeah, discretionary funds
can be used to nurture students

17:05.233 --> 17:07.610
artistically so they can grow up
and do that graffiti

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
that bougie people
don't get mad at.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.947
You mean a mural?

17:11.031 --> 17:12.282
That's it.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.659
But what you don't see
is how I make sure

17:14.743 --> 17:17.871
that forgetful students
get supplies.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.790
Or how I help students
with broke parents

17:20.874 --> 17:24.252
get uniforms that fit so they
don't get roasted all day.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.130
Or how I have barrels of lotion
stashed all around the school

17:27.130 --> 17:29.674
so these kids don't
start a commotion with
their crusty ankles.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.636
My unique approach to these
funds betters the school.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.848
Yes, we all understand the
importance of moisturization,

17:36.848 --> 17:38.475
but your time is up.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.436
No.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.645
Y'all not about to
rush me out of here

17:42.729 --> 17:44.356
like I'm Lil Mama
at the VMAs.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.774
Psst!
Hey. It's open.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.400
Because you know what?

17:47.484 --> 17:50.070
No matter what happens to me,
Abbott will be fine.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.654
Because the teachers
that work there

17:51.738 --> 17:53.740
are some of the most dedicated, hardworking,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.201
and creative teachers
in this entire city.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.036
You tell 'em, Ava!

17:59.496 --> 18:01.331
And it's not like y'all been
making it rain up in here.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.916
We've been taking
appetizer money

18:02.916 --> 18:05.919
and giving these kids
a charcuterie experience.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.088
Don't give us the money
because we need it.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.424
Give it to us because everyone
at Abbott deserves it.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.468
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.512
Well, thank you,
Principal Coleman.

18:15.512 --> 18:20.684
Uh, that was a very...
passionate plea.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.440
Well?

18:27.524 --> 18:28.692
Okay, sis!

18:28.692 --> 18:30.235
- I did that!
- And that's on what?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.070
Period!

18:32.070 --> 18:33.446
Okay, what's happening?

18:33.530 --> 18:35.573
I mean,
good job, Ava.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.701
Thank you, subordinate.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.161
So, our girl really did
a good job, huh?

18:40.245 --> 18:41.579
Surprisingly, yes.

18:41.663 --> 18:42.997
Ooh! So we get
the funding we need?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.999
No, of course not.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.460
As long as Ava's at Abbott
and I'm the superintendent,

18:47.544 --> 18:48.712
you never will.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.505
She blackmailed me.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.632
It's kind of hard to get over
being blackmailed.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.592
You know, he's not wrong.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.095
I haven't spoken to
my blackmailer in two years.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.848
Do I miss my sister?
Yeah, every day.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.851
Look, if it wasn't your school
suffering, it'd just be another.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.937
Don't be mad at me,
be mad at the system.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.317
I am mad.
I'm really mad.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.196
I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.199
I talked to my office,
and I have good news.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.701
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.161
Regarding?

19:21.161 --> 19:23.204
Regarding the fact
that Abbott will be a recipient

19:23.288 --> 19:25.206
of the Advancement Grant
this year.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.792
What a surprise.

19:27.876 --> 19:31.212
After 10 years
of impeccable applications,

19:31.296 --> 19:33.965
we suddenly
find ourselves worthy.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.133
How wonderful.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.635
Yes,
it is...wonderful.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.681
Ah. See you
in church on Sunday.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.975
And every Sunday
after that.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.936
Hmm.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.690
Barbara,
this is great!

19:50.774 --> 19:52.150
What are we gonna use
the grant for?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.360
I mean, which programs go?
Which ones stay?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.611
This could get
very stressful.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.613
Okay, you need to stop
thinking about this,

19:56.613 --> 19:58.156
because you're gonna break out
in hives.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.659
Because this is a decision
for our principal.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.955
Stop looking at me
like that.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.874
If anybody hugs me,
I'm turning down the grant.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.547
Did you...

20:14.631 --> 20:17.092
Did you shake someone down
for me?

20:17.092 --> 20:21.554
I shook someone down for us,
ya big <i>gabootz.</i>

20:21.638 --> 20:24.432
<i>Guboonza?
Garbanzo.</i>

20:24.516 --> 20:27.769
Yeah, that's a bean,
but thank you for trying.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.773
Sometimes
you try something new

20:31.773 --> 20:33.566
for the people you care about.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.486
The Lord helps those
who help themselves.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.781
And he punishes those
who have been helping themselves

20:39.781 --> 20:43.201
to the church's petty cash.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.078
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.039
I saw your little e-mail.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.290
I know.
That's why I'm sitting here.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.751
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

20:51.835 --> 20:54.254
This job requires you to be cool
and level-headed,

20:54.254 --> 20:57.007
and you ain't exactly known
for keeping your composure.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.551
I'm sure.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.636
This job means
more responsibility.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.014
Commitment.
Emotional availability.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.640
I understand.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.976
Well, welcome to teaching
full-time at Abbott, Mr. Eddie.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.894
Thank you.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.483
What I'm looking forward to
the most

21:15.567 --> 21:17.861
is having access to
the H.R. department.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.619
What's H.R.?

21:29.539 --> 21:32.667
