Anyone gonna get that?

00:25.559 --> 00:26.827
Not me.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.662
- Not me.
- Not the me.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.198
Not me neithers.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.103
Hold up!
Did somebody order pizza?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.437
- Not me.
- Not me.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.806
- Not the me.
- Not me neither.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.041
Wait.
Maybe I did order pizza.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.580
Pizza!

01:13.641 --> 01:14.642
Hello, hello.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.578
Where's the pizza, fool?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.213
I didn't bring pizza.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.782
You are a terrible
pizza delivery man.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.419
I was hoping to see my daughter.

01:25.453 --> 01:29.557
And I was hoping to see the hot discus
of the crust sauce and the cheese!

01:31.692 --> 01:34.428
Is anyone going to
tell Raven I'm here?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.333
Hello, hello.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.668
What do you want, Dad?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.237
Have you forgotten?
Tonight is demon prom.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.772
Not going.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.540
- You must go, Raven.
- No.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.177
But I nominated you
for prom queen!

01:49.210 --> 01:51.345
As my daughter,
you're guaranteed to win.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.514
I don't wanna be prom queen, Dad.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.750
If you don't do this, you'll regret
it for the rest of your eternal life.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.920
Being prom king made me
the demon I am today.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.889
I'd rather just
stay here and read.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.558
Hear me, daughter.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.761
You will go to demon prom
and be crowned prom queen.

02:07.795 --> 02:13.133
Or I will rain fire upon the Earth
until it is but cinder and ash!

02:14.535 --> 02:15.869
Fine.

02:15.903 --> 02:19.507
Good. Now all you need to do is
show up in your most evil dress

02:19.540 --> 02:21.375
with a nice, crude demon boy

02:21.409 --> 02:23.644
and the crown is yours.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.845
Whatever.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.648
You grew up so fast.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.684
Now, go ahead and get ready.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.656
What was all that about, Mama?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.459
My dad is making me
go to demon prom.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.527
Prom?

02:39.560 --> 02:40.661
We loves prom!

02:40.694 --> 02:42.630
Oh, you must bring us
with you, Raven.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.433
Guys, it's not prom.
It's demon prom.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.968
You know, for demons.
If you show up with me,

02:48.001 --> 02:50.538
my dad will be super mad at me.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.905
Oh, hey.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.541
You guys wanna go to demon prom?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.676
Yeah!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.278
Perfect.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.646
Me and Beasty are gonna
hang out by the food,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.415
being cool dudes and saying
hello to the ladies.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.551
That's what's up! Uh!

03:03.584 --> 03:06.820
Robin, I was wondering,
this prom is so important.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.689
I need to have the coolest date.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.725
I'm flattered, Raven, but I
was going to ask Starfire.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.294
Oh. That's cool.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.530
I just thought you'd make
a great prom king.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.998
Prom king.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.967
Kneel, you savages!

03:20.000 --> 03:22.436
Kneel before your king!

03:28.409 --> 03:29.677
Bad news, Star.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.012
I won't be taking you
to demon prom.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.981
That is the fine.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.584
I'm so sorry. This must be the
greatest disappointment of your life.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.685
Not at all.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.721
But don't worry, you'll
find that special someone.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.755
Mmm-hmm.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.457
So brave.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.726
Okay, we better
hurry up and get ready.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.261
Prom night!

03:54.935 --> 03:56.870
All right!

03:56.904 --> 03:57.938
Yeah, boy!

03:57.971 --> 03:59.307
Where are you dorks going?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.741
- Prom, baby!
- What?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.777
About prom.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.279
Um...

04:05.313 --> 04:07.748
Hello, sir. I'm here
to pick Raven up.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.049
I'm her date.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.752
- Raven!
- Be right there.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.654
I don't know what's going on
but I am not going to let

04:13.687 --> 04:15.523
my daughter go out
with someone like you.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.391
Don't worry, sir.
I'm a good boy.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.026
I'll have her home by 7:00 p.m.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.362
And I'll make sure she doesn't
get into any trouble.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.497
That's the problem.
Raven is half demon.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.833
She must stay out past
midnight, revel in mischief,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.901
and possible enslave
another dimension.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.539
I was thinking about maybe
stopping for ice cream afterwards.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.774
You disgust me.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.343
I'm ready.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.915
Milady!

04:43.384 --> 04:45.353
You look stunning.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.922
Raven, your friends can't come.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.624
They're going to ruin
your big night.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.593
Sorry, Dad,
but this is my squad.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.829
Your squad?
This is not a Taylor Swift video.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.565
This is demon prom!

04:57.598 --> 04:59.967
If I'm gonna go, I wanna
be with my friends.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.436
Very well.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.816
It is the more dreary
than I expected.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.586
Yeah, this don't look like
John Hughes kind of situation.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.455
Then I says we get
this party started!

05:21.489 --> 05:22.823
The party has already started.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.092
Now, you will all
stand quietly in a corner

05:25.125 --> 05:27.695
and not jeopardize Raven's
ascension to the prom throne.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.464
- But we wanna...
- Shut up, dork!

05:30.498 --> 05:32.099
Don't worry about him.
You're my squad.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.767
Just be yourself
and have a great time.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.503
All right!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.572
Free food!

05:38.606 --> 05:41.108
Wait. Youse think
this sandwich is vegan?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.110
I don't know, dummy.
Ask the sandwich.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.112
Yo, sandwich, is you vegan?

05:45.145 --> 05:47.347
- Yeah, I'm Vegan.
- Cool.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.984
These are the cool guys
I was telling you about.

05:51.018 --> 05:55.556
Hey. What's up, demon mama?
How you doing?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.857
You tried the food yet?

06:02.162 --> 06:05.399
What are you doing?
Stop that! You're ruining everything!

06:07.034 --> 06:09.870
What's the matter, Starfire?

06:09.903 --> 06:13.607
The demon prom is not the
wonderful place I had imagined.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.908
It is a little gloomy.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.810
Too bad we can't
brighten things up.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.548
Well, I did bring the bag
of the stray kitties.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.652
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's brighten up this prom.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.691
Oh, come on. Kittens?
This is an outrage.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.763
Greetings, greetings,
one and all

06:35.796 --> 06:38.699
from your future prom king!

06:40.701 --> 06:42.503
Now hear me, peasants!

06:42.536 --> 06:45.739
I demand that you castest
thine votes for us!

06:47.207 --> 06:49.877
Do not boo me.
I am your liege.

06:49.910 --> 06:54.448
Now, I have prepared
a poem for this occasion.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.783
We hate poems!

06:55.816 --> 06:58.752
Stop booing! Stop it!
Bow before me!

06:58.786 --> 07:01.455
Bow before me, knaves, bow!

07:01.489 --> 07:03.056
He's my date.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.526
Your squad is humiliating you.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.728
Oh. Guess I won't be
prom queen after all.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.097
Raven, don't throw
this opportunity away.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.532
This is what's best for you.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.933
It's best for you, Dad.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.435
You never think about
anyone but yourself.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.807
Shut up, dork.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.814
What's gotten you down, pops?

07:26.847 --> 07:30.684
Raven was a shoe-in for prom queen
until you all embarrassed her.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.853
All I wanted was for my
little girl to have a moment

07:32.886 --> 07:36.724
where she could see how much
everyone loves her, including me.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.760
But she always
thinks she knows what's best.

07:39.793 --> 07:44.532
We did not realize we were ruining friend
Raven's chance to be the queen of the proms.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.901
Well, you did.
You guys are dorks.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.571
There's gotta be something that
we can do to get her that crown.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.940
We'll have to find a way
to win over the crowd.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.976
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

08:03.884 --> 08:07.154

Put your hands together

08:55.736 --> 08:58.772
And this year's demon
prom king and queen are...

08:58.806 --> 09:01.208
Hold on, let me get my glasses.

Please be me, please be me, please be me.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.746
Robin and Raven!

09:07.915 --> 09:09.983
Yes, yes, yes!

09:11.852 --> 09:15.288
I've been waiting for this my whole life!

09:15.322 --> 09:18.358
Kneel, peasants! Kneel!

09:19.860 --> 09:22.062
- No!
- You should be the happy.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.264
Yeah, your pops is right, yo.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.768
Youse gonna look back on this day and
remembers how much everybody loves you.

09:27.801 --> 09:32.105
You think that's what demon
prom is about? Making memories?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.876
It's about deciding who's
gonna rule the underworld

09:35.909 --> 09:38.011
for the next millennium,
you dorks!

09:39.279 --> 09:40.981
That's right.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.317
Finally, my evil little buttercup
will be where she belongs.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.353
Come on, let's go.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.355
I'm not going anywhere.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.057
I'm the prom queen.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.363
Obey the prom queen!

09:56.396 --> 09:58.331
Why do you refuse your destiny?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.600
My destiny is my choice!

10:01.802 --> 10:04.037
See you at demon graduation!

10:08.041 --> 10:10.644
Sorrys we almost made you the
queen of the underworlds, Mama.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.913
Honestly, I don't know why
we keep trusting your dad.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.182
It is because we are
the easily manipulated.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.885
It's cool.
Hey, where's Robin?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.956
Best prom ever!

10:25.092 --> 10:26.660
Shut up, dork.
