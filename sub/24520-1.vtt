<i>"Could we live it over again,</i>

02:43.730 --> 02:46.231
<i>were it worth the pain?</i>

02:46.300 --> 02:48.366
<i>Could the passionate past that is fled</i>

02:48.435 --> 02:49.768
<i>call back its dead?"</i>

02:51.071 --> 02:52.770
Oscar wilde.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.306
<i>"Roses and rue."</i>

02:57.678 --> 02:58.777
<i>Tristan.</i>

03:00.714 --> 03:01.847
Joseph.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.817
Jesus. What time is it?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.319
<i>It's time for you to rise and shine.</i>

03:07.387 --> 03:08.292
<i>It's a beautiful morning out there.</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:11.689
Is it?

03:11.758 --> 03:13.191
<i>Well, of course, it is.</i>

03:13.259 --> 03:14.626
<i>It's the city of angels, my friend.</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:17.562
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

03:17.631 --> 03:20.798
Sound. Yeah, I feel sound.
Bit tired is all.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.667
<i>Late one again</i>
<i>last night?</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:26.671
Honestly, I can't remember.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.741
<i>Is Caitlin with you?</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:32.010
No, no. Just a few friends.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.645
Needed a break from all that.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.515
<i>No, trouble in paradise?</i>

03:38.618 --> 03:39.884
It's not that. It's just...

03:39.953 --> 03:41.152
She doesn't understand me
sometimes, that's all.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.621
<i>What doesn't she understand?</i>

03:43.690 --> 03:44.710
My world's very different

03:44.758 --> 03:45.924
from hers, you know?

03:45.993 --> 03:48.460
Sometimes, it gets to be
a bit too much and...

03:49.629 --> 03:51.963
- I can't seem to find...
- <i>Balance?</i>

03:53.467 --> 03:54.833
Yeah. Balance.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.507
<i>Yeah. Well, I could see
the problem with that.</i>

03:56.537 --> 03:59.271
<i>She's not used to dating
somebody like you.</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:01.673
<i>She's used to normal guys,
normal jobs, normal lives.</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:03.308
<i>That's gotta be tough.</i>

04:05.112 --> 04:06.912
Maybe I should be more understanding.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.980
Try to relate more.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.382
Put myself in her shoes.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.917
<i>How can you, though?</i>

04:11.985 --> 04:14.452
<i>You've got everything a man
could wish for.</i>

04:14.521 --> 04:15.954
<i>Sometimes that presents</i>

04:16.022 --> 04:16.872
<i>its own set of unique challenges.</i>

04:16.890 --> 04:18.856
Listen. Don't get me wrong, I...

04:18.925 --> 04:20.992
I do love her to bits. But...

04:21.060 --> 04:22.694
We're not just supposed to have a laugh.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.329
You know, a bit of banter?

04:24.398 --> 04:26.698
Not this constant, fucking criticism

04:26.767 --> 04:27.766
and trying to change me.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.201
<i>Well, it sounds like</i>

04:29.269 --> 04:30.502
<i>you might need
to be alone for a while.</i>

04:30.571 --> 04:33.938
<i>Consider sowing your wild oats.</i>

04:34.007 --> 04:36.341
<i>Sometimes,
despite our best intentions,</i>

04:36.410 --> 04:38.409
<i>things are just not meant to be.</i>

04:39.846 --> 04:41.546
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.814
<i>Yeah. Maybe I am.</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:44.950
<i>Maybe I'm not.</i>

04:45.018 --> 04:48.486
<i>As I always remind you, I'm not god.</i>

04:48.555 --> 04:50.455
<i>But if I were to give you
my professional advice,</i>

04:50.524 --> 04:51.723
<i>you need time out, my friend.</i>

04:52.826 --> 04:53.958
Thanks, Joseph.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.626
Always helps
to get an early session in.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.729
<i>As your therapist, Tristan,</i>

04:58.798 --> 05:00.699
<i>I am here for you anytime,</i>
<i>night or day. You just call.</i>

05:01.935 --> 05:03.601
You're a lifesaver.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.504
<i>No. That is what 
you're paying me for.</i>

05:06.173 --> 05:07.638
<i>Now rise, Mr. Tristan Blake.</i>

05:07.707 --> 05:08.573
<i>You have a big day ahead of you.</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:09.808
<i>Great things await.</i>

05:10.944 --> 05:12.343
Goodbye, Joseph.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.546
<i>Go got them, Tristan.</i>

05:21.121 --> 05:22.687
<i>It's another beautiful day in paradise.</i>

05:22.756 --> 05:26.457
<i>Temps are 70's at the beaches
and 80's in the valley.</i>

05:26.526 --> 05:27.892
<i>Hey, stay tuned...</i>

05:27.961 --> 05:29.660
<i>'cause we got a hot show</i>
<i>for you today!</i>

05:29.729 --> 05:30.895
<i>Hot!</i>

05:49.883 --> 05:51.149
<i>Is this Tristan?</i>

05:51.218 --> 05:53.117
<i>Tristan? Tristan Blake?</i>

05:53.186 --> 05:56.654
- Hello?
- <i>Tristan! Thank god, man.</i>

05:56.723 --> 05:59.157
<i>I've been trying to get a hold
of you all night, man.</i>

05:59.226 --> 06:02.126
<i>I thought you might've,
drove into a ditch.</i>

06:02.195 --> 06:04.829
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- Nothing. I'm alive. Barely.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.364
What's going on?

06:06.433 --> 06:07.398
<i>Well, I'm pretty sure
you took my car</i>

06:07.467 --> 06:08.466
<i>from the valet last night.</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.668
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

06:10.737 --> 06:12.237
Fuck, man. I must have
mixed it up with my one.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.039
<i>Can you... can you check
your genitalia?</i>

06:15.108 --> 06:16.841
<i>Do you have your cock and balls?</i>

06:16.910 --> 06:18.409
Hanging on by a fucking thread.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.878
<i>Blake, you know you
didn't drive last night, right?</i>

06:20.947 --> 06:22.613
Yeah.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.182
Sam, I'm fucking glad
one of us remembers.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.851
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:25.919 --> 06:26.918
<i>Look, I'm just glad
you're all right, buddy.</i>

06:26.987 --> 06:29.521
<i>Is the car in one piece?</i>

06:40.033 --> 06:41.266
Yeah, yeah. It's grand.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.634
All good, buddy. All good.
Not a scratch on it.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.069
<i>Can you bring it to me?</i>

06:45.138 --> 06:47.071
Yeah, well, listen, sorry
about that again, good man.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.239
I must've been out of my fucking mind.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.207
- Are you at home?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

06:49.275 --> 06:50.541
<i>I'll be here all day.</i>

06:50.610 --> 06:52.743
<i>You know, I was worried
you totaled it.</i>

06:52.812 --> 06:54.245
<i>You weren't...</i>

06:54.314 --> 06:55.246
<i>In the best shape, believe me, man.</i>

06:55.315 --> 06:56.514
No, no.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.415
Buddy, I'm solid as a rock
behind the wheel.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.184
Even poleaxed, you know that.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.886
<i>Well, I suppose
you've had enough practice.</i>

07:01.955 --> 07:03.654
<i>All right, man.</i>
<i>I'll see you later, okay?</i>

07:03.723 --> 07:04.956
<i>Take care of my baby.</i>

07:05.024 --> 07:06.080
- I will. I will, buddy.
- <i>Please.</i>

07:06.125 --> 07:07.190
She'll be back to you. Don't worry.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.493
- <i>Okay, I'm not</i>
- Bye.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.527
<i>Completely convinced.</i>

07:18.204 --> 07:19.604
<i>You are trying to give me</i>

07:19.673 --> 07:21.006
<i>a fucking heart attack.</i>

07:21.808 --> 07:23.007
<i>Do I even wanna know</i>

07:23.076 --> 07:24.709
<i>why you aren't
in New York right now,</i>

07:24.778 --> 07:27.778
<i>or at the very fucking least
on a plane there?</i>

07:27.847 --> 07:29.413
<i>Let me guess.</i>

07:29.482 --> 07:31.182
<i>You went out with your
fuckwit friends last night,</i>

07:31.250 --> 07:34.619
<i>and now you're too hungover
to take a shit, let alone fly.</i>

07:34.688 --> 07:37.589
<i>God. Talk about a shower
of useless alcoholic cunts.</i>

07:39.359 --> 07:40.804
Jeez, Louise.
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

07:40.827 --> 07:41.859
Even for you.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.528
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

07:43.596 --> 07:45.696
<i>You're spiraling 
out of control again,Tris.</i>

07:45.765 --> 07:47.398
<i>I'm gonna call you some morning,</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:48.933
<i>and it's gonna be a doctor
answering your phone</i>

07:49.002 --> 07:51.535
<i>instead of you, 
as he stands over your dead,</i>

07:51.604 --> 07:53.204
<i>booze-riddled shit stain 
of a smear of a corpse.</i>

07:53.273 --> 07:55.907
<i>You can't act like 
you're a machine forever.</i>

07:55.976 --> 07:58.543
I'm flying today.
Have I missed a call time yet?

07:58.612 --> 08:01.178
<i>No. Not for lack</i>
<i>of trying, jackass.</i>

08:01.247 --> 08:03.948
Look. I'm packing right now, I swear.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.083
I'll be first on the plane.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.618
<i>I'll believe that when I see it.</i>

08:07.687 --> 08:09.086
<i>And while you're at it,
don't be seen again</i>

08:09.155 --> 08:10.021
<i>with that embarrassing
brown sack of shit</i>

08:10.089 --> 08:12.791
<i>you call a suitcase.</i>

08:12.860 --> 08:14.092
<i>Because it is not romantic.</i>
<i>It is ugly.</i>

08:14.161 --> 08:15.193
<i>And every time
you're photographed at the LAX,</i>

08:15.262 --> 08:17.228
<i>you look like a runaway hobo.</i>

08:17.297 --> 08:18.696
It has sentimental value.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.232
<i>Well, so did my pretty, 
pretty Princess panties</i>

08:21.301 --> 08:22.734
<i>before I lost my virginity,</i>

08:22.802 --> 08:24.068
<i>but I haven't worn those</i>
<i>in years.</i>

08:24.137 --> 08:25.970
That's 'cause I said
there's more holes on them.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.739
<i>Don't you even. Zip it.</i>

08:28.808 --> 08:29.874
And I tell you now,
if you want new jeans,

08:29.942 --> 08:31.275
then you're stuck onto...
To those.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.945
<i>They still fucking fit,</i>
<i>you asshole.</i>

08:34.013 --> 08:35.746
<i>Perfectly. Like a glove,</i>
<i>I'll have you know.</i>

08:35.815 --> 08:38.015
<i>Just... will you take it easy</i>
<i>and be on that plane?</i>

08:38.083 --> 08:39.817
<i>Now what did I just say?</i>

08:39.885 --> 08:42.687
Don't be late. Be on the plane.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.755
<i>And? </i>

08:44.324 --> 08:45.490
No bag.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.092
<i>Please, do us all a favor.</i>

08:48.161 --> 08:49.260
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

09:14.120 --> 09:15.654
Jesus Christ.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.592
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

09:22.362 --> 09:23.394
What are you on about?

09:23.463 --> 09:25.029
<i>The church, Tristan.</i>

09:25.098 --> 09:27.865
<i>Everyone's waiting.</i>
<i>The entire fucking town, Stan.</i>

09:27.934 --> 09:29.500
<i>We're all ready.</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:31.169
<i>We're just waiting on you.</i>
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

09:31.971 --> 09:33.370
<i>Church?</i>

09:33.439 --> 09:34.772
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You've heard of it.</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:37.041
<i>The big stone building</i>
<i>god lives in.</i>

09:37.110 --> 09:38.343
<i>You better be on your way.</i>

09:40.013 --> 09:41.879
Listen, I'm not falling
for this one, gráinne.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.681
<i>That's not till</i>
<i>the fifth of June.</i>

09:43.750 --> 09:45.783
<i>May, Tristan!</i>

09:45.852 --> 09:47.918
<i>Fifth of fucking may!</i>

09:50.223 --> 09:51.589
I'm in LA.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.158
-<i>LA?</i>
- <i>Yeah. That's what I just said.</i>

09:54.227 --> 09:55.760
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

09:55.829 --> 09:58.062
<i>You'd better be fucking joking
with me, Tristan.</i>

09:58.131 --> 10:00.398
No. I'm not. I'm in LA.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.833
Where, I don't know.

10:01.902 --> 10:06.270
But I know I'm not back
<i>in that fucking cunt of aspas.</i>

10:06.339 --> 10:08.906
<i>You're gonna break
your sister's fucking heart.</i>

10:08.975 --> 10:10.007
<i>I hope you know that.</i>

10:10.076 --> 10:13.310
Jesus. I said, I'm fucking sorry, like.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.746
I do have other things
going on in my life, you know.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.882
<i>You know, you're a selfish little prick.</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:19.384
<i>It's always been about you.</i>

10:19.452 --> 10:20.585
<i>Everything's always been about you!</i>

10:20.654 --> 10:22.753
Yeah, well, I'm sure 
I won't be that selfish

10:22.822 --> 10:23.988
when I'm stung with the bill.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.824
I won't need to be there
for that, now, will I?

10:28.495 --> 10:30.695
<i>What the hell happened</i>
<i>to you, Tristan?</i>

10:32.899 --> 10:35.266
Nothing.
I've always been this way.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.468
<i>I'm just glad</i>
<i>that your mother</i>

10:37.537 --> 10:39.804
<i>isn't here to see this.</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:42.874
<i>To see what sort of man</i>
<i>you've become.</i>

10:45.411 --> 10:46.944
Yeah. Better off, I'd say.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.679
<i>Indeed.</i>

10:48.748 --> 10:51.849
<i>If she was, it'd fucking</i>
<i>kill her all over again.</i>

11:18.144 --> 11:18.976
Hey, darling,

11:19.045 --> 11:20.511
I was just about to call you.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.213
<i>Don't even bother,</i>
<i>Tristan.</i>

11:23.316 --> 11:25.116
<i>The funny thing is, </i>

11:25.185 --> 11:27.285
<i>I love you more than anything.</i>

11:28.488 --> 11:31.021
<i>I would do anything for you.</i>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.157
<i>And this is how you treat me.</i>

11:33.226 --> 11:36.227
<i>What's worse,</i>
<i>this is how you treat yourself.</i>

11:37.530 --> 11:40.165
<i>Okay. Sweetheart, I'm sorry.</i>

11:42.068 --> 11:43.334
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

11:49.876 --> 11:51.542
What does that mean?

11:51.611 --> 11:54.345
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>I thought you would change.</i>

11:54.414 --> 11:57.148
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>you lie to me constantly.</i>

11:57.217 --> 11:59.316
<i>I'm sorry you're selfish.</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:01.185
<i>I'm sorry you're a drunk.</i>

12:01.254 --> 12:03.020
<i>I'm sorry you're a drug addict.</i>

12:03.089 --> 12:04.522
<i>And most of all, I'm so sorry</i>

12:04.590 --> 12:05.389
<i>you are such</i>
<i>an incredible coward.</i>

12:05.458 --> 12:07.392
Listen. Wait a minute, now.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.961
I'm clean...

12:11.030 --> 12:12.397
I'm clean as a whistle.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.900
And with me and you? Listen.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.304
I'm trying as fucking best
i can here, all right?

12:20.373 --> 12:21.840
So please give me a break.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.843
<i>Go try somewhere else.</i>

12:26.646 --> 12:28.279
<i>I'm done.</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:06.243
<i>I never wanna see</i>
<i>you again, Tristan.</i>

14:06.312 --> 14:07.378
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

14:08.181 --> 14:09.614
<i>I hope you die.</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:14.051
<i>I hope you go die,</i>
<i>because as far as I'm concerned,</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:15.420
<i>you're already dead to me.</i>

14:16.923 --> 14:19.490
<i>You're already dead</i>
<i>to all of us.</i>

15:52.218 --> 15:54.418
<i>Hey, angel.</i>

15:54.487 --> 15:56.053
Darlin'.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.588
<i>I know you're not </i>
<i>gonna tell me</i>

15:57.657 --> 15:59.624
<i>what all this fuss</i>
<i>is about tonight,</i>

15:59.692 --> 16:00.625
<i>so I'm not even gonna ask.</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:02.560
How are you?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.161
<i>Excited about my surprise.</i>

16:04.230 --> 16:05.729
Me, too.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.365
<i>And you're sure</i>
<i>you wanna give up today for me?</i>

16:08.434 --> 16:09.767
I'm sure.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.235
<i>You are?</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:13.637
I've never been more sure
about anything in my whole life.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.906
I have you to thank for that.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.709
<i>No, angel.</i>

16:18.778 --> 16:20.445
<i>You have yourself</i>
<i>to thank for that.</i>

16:21.114 --> 16:22.380
Listen, darlin',

16:22.449 --> 16:24.581
I checked my phone
and the highways are packed,

16:24.650 --> 16:27.451
so I'm gonna take
surface streets instead.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.421
Looks like I'll be with you
in a little over an hour.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.123
<i>Countin' the minutes already.</i>

16:32.692 --> 16:33.691
Me, too.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.326
I love you.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.728
<i>I love you, too.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:22.833
<i>How are you now?</i>

18:22.902 --> 18:24.102
Declan?

18:24.570 --> 18:25.769
Dec? You there?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.071
<i>Tristan! That you?</i>

18:27.139 --> 18:28.739
Yeah, man. Sorry,
didn't know you were on nights.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.174
I can call back.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.509
<i>Well, hang on.</i>
<i>Hang on there a minute.</i>

18:34.780 --> 18:36.213
<i>Jesus, man. That's better.</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.448
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>It's been forever, man.</i>

18:38.517 --> 18:40.016
Listen, I have a favor
to ask you.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.586
<i>Yeah, anything, man.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

18:42.655 --> 18:45.189
You would be able to round up
the boys the first week of July?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.591
<i>Sure, I can.</i>

18:46.659 --> 18:48.458
<i>Tell me you're finally</i>
<i>coming home to us now.</i>

18:48.527 --> 18:50.361
Something like that.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.364
Listen, if you can do that
for me, it'd be great.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.333
<i>I'm on it, buddy.</i>
<i>Consider it done.</i>

18:57.570 --> 18:58.835
How is the family?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.203
<i>They're all good.</i>

19:00.272 --> 19:01.197
<i>Cathy just started</i>
<i>primary school,</i>

19:01.206 --> 19:01.996
<i>can you believe it?</i>

19:02.040 --> 19:05.275
Man, time is just flyin'.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.010
You watch the united game?

19:07.079 --> 19:08.445
<i>It was dark, man.</i>
<i>I wish I didn't.</i>

19:08.514 --> 19:10.747
<i>Only for Rooney,</i>
<i>we're dead and buried.</i>

19:10.816 --> 19:12.416
Keeping us alive this year.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.251
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>he keeps us alive every year.</i>

19:14.320 --> 19:15.886
<i>He's all we've got.</i>

19:15.955 --> 19:17.688
<i>It's gonna take us years, man,</i>
<i>to get a team back.</i>

19:17.757 --> 19:18.756
Yeah.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.624
Everything takes time,
all right.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.359
<i>It sure does.</i>

19:22.428 --> 19:24.695
<i>Com'ere. You all right, man?</i>
<i>You sound a bit off.</i>

19:24.764 --> 19:26.964
Yeah, yeah. I'm sound, man.
I'm just a bit tired is all.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.632
<i>Too many</i>
<i>Hollywood parties.</i>

19:28.701 --> 19:29.933
<i>That's what's wrong with you.</i>

19:30.002 --> 19:31.535
<i>Do you want it now? Do you?</i>

19:31.604 --> 19:34.905
No, no.
I'm off the circuit now, dec.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.740
Clean living.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.675
More exhausted
than I've ever been.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.644
Fuck, it's not easy.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.613
But I keep telling myself
it's all worth it.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.381
<i>Yeah, I'll believe that</i>

19:44.450 --> 19:45.382
<i>when I see it, buddy.</i>

19:45.451 --> 19:47.618
<i>You fuckin' animal, you.</i>

19:47.687 --> 19:49.153
<i>Com'ere, what's wrong</i>
<i>with your pint anyway?</i>

19:49.222 --> 19:50.555
<i>Take it easy on yourself,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

19:50.623 --> 19:53.523
Nothing. Fifty of them
is a different story, though.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.259
You do know me.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.794
<i>Well, that's true, man.</i>

19:56.863 --> 19:57.810
<i>You did always like</i>
<i>a bit more than the rest of us.</i>

19:57.830 --> 20:00.497
<i>But sure, you could handle it.</i>

20:00.566 --> 20:01.698
<i>You're a party animal, man.</i>
<i>That's what you do.</i>

20:01.767 --> 20:04.034
Not anymore. Honestly, buddy.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.602
<i>That's great, man.</i>
<i>Proud of you.</i>

20:05.671 --> 20:07.471
<i>I won't lie,</i>
<i>I won't put money on you,</i>

20:07.540 --> 20:09.006
<i>but, I'm proud of you.</i>

20:09.075 --> 20:11.408
<i>Com'ere, got on to your old lad</i>
<i>there the last day.</i>

20:11.477 --> 20:12.509
<i>Just to check up on him.</i>

20:12.578 --> 20:14.077
<i>You know, he's doing all right.</i>

20:14.146 --> 20:16.380
<i>I'll tell you why, he's</i>
<i>as stubborn as ever, that one.</i>

20:16.449 --> 20:18.015
That'll never change.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.617
Listen, I appreciate that
though, dec.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.287
How's work going?
You all right for a few pound?

20:23.356 --> 20:24.322
<i>Com'ere,</i>
<i>I'm sound, buddy,</i>

20:24.390 --> 20:25.489
<i>hold on to what you have.</i>

20:25.558 --> 20:27.358
<i>For god's sake.</i>

20:27.427 --> 20:29.093
<i>I saw your last movie anyway.</i>
<i>You might need it, buddy.</i>

20:29.162 --> 20:31.295
<i>You'll be back here grafting</i>
<i>with me in no time,</i>

20:31.364 --> 20:32.663
<i>making shite like that.</i>

20:33.900 --> 20:35.466
Go fuck yourself.
It wasn't that bad.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.635
<i>What? Grafting me now,</i>
<i>or that shit movie?</i>

20:38.704 --> 20:39.836
Both.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.938
At least I got
paid well for the film.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.840
<i>Com'ere,</i>
<i>I've seen better acting</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:46.009
<i>in Cathy's pre-school plays, </i>
<i>buddy.</i>

20:46.078 --> 20:47.511
<i>No. It's not bad.</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:49.146
<i>Someone has to give you</i>
<i>some shite for it.</i>

20:49.214 --> 20:53.050
<i>Although that chick there,</i>
<i>she'd some pair of tits on her.</i>

20:53.119 --> 20:55.819
<i>Tell me now, you're after </i>
<i>eating the box of her.</i>

20:55.888 --> 20:58.622
No, no. Not anymore, buddy.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.325
Don't worry, the critics
have you covered on that one.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.493
<i>On the tits?</i>

21:03.629 --> 21:04.828
<i>That's a pity.</i>

21:04.897 --> 21:07.964
Arra. Some things fucking
never change, boy.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.466
<i>Com'ere, sorry, man.</i>
<i>Gotta run here.</i>

21:09.535 --> 21:10.968
<i>The foreman's on my back.</i>

21:11.036 --> 21:12.869
<i>Jesus, man,</i>
<i>if cunts were scarce,</i>

21:12.938 --> 21:14.738
<i>this lad make two.</i>

21:14.807 --> 21:16.173
<i>Well, take care of yourself.</i>

21:16.242 --> 21:17.408
<i>Will... I'll sort all that out </i>
<i>with the boys for you.</i>

21:17.476 --> 21:19.743
Thanks, man.
Really good chatting to you.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.078
<i>Yeah. Likewise, man.</i>

21:21.147 --> 21:22.680
- Take it easy, buddy.
- -<i>You too.</i>

21:27.453 --> 21:28.952
<i>Tristan, my man. Joseph here.</i>

21:29.021 --> 21:30.421
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>when you're free to talk.</i>

21:32.425 --> 21:33.790
<i>Tristan!</i>

21:33.859 --> 21:35.492
<i>Joseph again.</i>

21:35.561 --> 21:36.960
<i>Wanted to make sure</i>
<i>you got my first message.</i>

21:37.029 --> 21:39.029
<i>Mr. Blake, it's Dr. lynch.</i>

21:39.098 --> 21:40.530
<i>Listen, I've been going over</i>

21:40.599 --> 21:41.498
<i>your previous addiction</i>
<i>treatment history.</i>

21:41.567 --> 21:43.200
<i>And I have a concern,</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:45.368
<i>I need to discuss with you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

21:45.437 --> 21:46.536
<i>Can you please call me back...</i>

21:53.045 --> 21:55.879
- Hello.
- -<i>Tristan, my man.</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:58.515
Joseph. Look.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.450
I can't really talk right now.
I've a lot going on,

22:00.519 --> 22:02.586
- so maybe we can...
- -<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

22:02.655 --> 22:04.555
A lot, man, just a lot.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.823
Look, I really gotta go.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.393
And I'm also driving,
so I shouldn't be on the phone.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.761
<i>Come on, now.</i>

22:10.830 --> 22:11.862
<i>I know you've got</i>
<i>that fancy car.</i>

22:11.931 --> 22:13.364
<i>It's got a hands-free system.</i>

22:14.533 --> 22:15.866
- It has.
- -<i>So, we're good.</i>

22:15.935 --> 22:17.802
<i>So where you off to,</i>
<i>my man?</i>

22:18.904 --> 22:20.504
The palisades.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.340
<i>Aren't you supposed</i>
<i>to be on set right now?</i>

22:23.108 --> 22:24.074
<i>Who you going to see?</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:26.710
<i>You get my voicemail, Joseph?</i>

22:26.779 --> 22:28.378
<i>Yes, and yes.</i>
<i>Payment received.</i>

22:28.447 --> 22:31.481
<i>You never fail on payments.</i>
<i>You're always good on payments.</i>

22:31.550 --> 22:32.816
<i>Very deep pockets.</i>

22:32.885 --> 22:35.152
Super. So we're all square.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.688
Look, Joseph, I'm feeling
really, really good today.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.691
I've actually never felt better,
so no need for a session.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.360
I've really got to run,
all right?

22:43.428 --> 22:45.762
<i>Okay, movie star.</i>
<i>You are the boss.</i>

22:45.831 --> 22:46.830
<i>Here if you need me.</i>

22:46.899 --> 22:48.099
Bye, Joseph.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.733
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Dad.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.502
I hope it's not
too late for you.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.737
<i>No. No, son.</i>

23:27.806 --> 23:29.239
<i>I don't have to be up early anyway.</i>

23:29.308 --> 23:30.307
<i>The cows are calving.</i>

23:30.376 --> 23:32.742
It's really good to hear
your voice, dad.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.411
How are you feeling?

23:34.479 --> 23:36.146
<i>Sure, I'm grand. I'm grand. I'm great.</i>

23:36.215 --> 23:38.014
<i>I always feel great, son.</i>

23:38.083 --> 23:40.617
That's great, dad.
That's really great.

23:40.686 --> 23:43.687
<i>So, </i>
<i>when are you coming home?</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:45.889
Listen, dad,
i have a favor to ask you.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.457
<i>Yeah. Go on. Go on.</i>

23:47.526 --> 23:49.259
<i>Anything at all, son.</i>
<i>Anything at all.</i>

23:49.328 --> 23:50.427
I would really love for you

23:50.496 --> 23:52.162
to fly out here
in the first week of July.

23:52.231 --> 23:56.666
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Sure, I'm fine here, son.</i>

23:56.735 --> 23:59.736
<i>And who would look</i>
<i>after the farm?</i>

23:59.805 --> 24:01.872
<i>Who will make sure everything's</i>
<i>in running order?</i>

24:01.941 --> 24:02.840
- <i>It...</i>
- Dad, you don't...

24:02.909 --> 24:04.575
<i>What? No. No, look.</i>

24:04.644 --> 24:05.509
<i>You just come home</i>
<i>whenever you're ready, son.</i>

24:05.578 --> 24:07.610
<i>All right. I'm here.</i>

24:07.679 --> 24:09.112
<i>Kept your room just the same,</i>

24:09.181 --> 24:10.914
<i>and your mother put</i>
<i>the kettle on for tea.</i>

24:10.983 --> 24:12.616
I can't come home, dad.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.151
I have to work over here
all summer.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.919
<i>What?</i>
<i>Can't you take holidays?</i>

24:15.988 --> 24:17.588
It's not that simple.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.089
<i>Yes, but you're working</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

24:19.158 --> 24:21.057
<i>You just take</i>
<i>your entitled days.</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:22.158
<i>It's the law.</i>

24:22.227 --> 24:24.060
With my job, it's different.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.530
Look, I'll come home when I can,

24:26.599 --> 24:27.898
but, for once,

24:27.967 --> 24:31.535
I would really love for you
to just come out here.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.170
I beg you, dad.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.738
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>Enough of that talk for now.</i>

24:34.807 --> 24:35.606
<i>Right, I have to go</i>
<i>and feed the cows.</i>

24:35.675 --> 24:38.074
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

24:38.143 --> 24:39.809
<i>You just come home</i>
<i>whenever you're ready.</i>

24:39.878 --> 24:40.977
<i>I'll wait. There's no panic.</i>

24:41.046 --> 24:43.647
Dad, you don't have
to feed the cows.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.948
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

24:46.118 --> 24:47.684
Nothing.
Look, I'll talk to you later.

24:47.753 --> 24:48.885
Take care of yourself, please.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.053
<i>Which I always do.</i>

24:50.122 --> 24:51.655
I know, dad.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.223
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Goodbye, now, Tristan, bye.</i>

24:54.760 --> 24:55.759
I love you.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.608
Hello?

25:44.677 --> 25:45.943
<i>Movie star.</i>

25:46.012 --> 25:48.878
Joseph, I thought I told you
i was really busy today.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.246
<i>No, you did.</i>

25:50.315 --> 25:51.181
<i>But I could hear it</i>
<i>in your voice.</i>

25:51.249 --> 25:52.749
<i>You sound fragile. </i>

25:52.818 --> 25:54.784
<i>And I just wanna make sure</i>
<i>you're okay.</i>

25:54.853 --> 25:56.319
I'm fine.
Thanks for reaching out.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.854
<i>You know,</i>
<i>this often happens</i>

25:57.923 --> 26:00.424
<i>when a patient passes</i>
<i>a traumatic milestone.</i>

26:00.493 --> 26:02.059
"Traumatic milestone,"
what are you talking about?

26:02.128 --> 26:04.562
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>It's your anniversary.</i>

26:06.065 --> 26:07.665
<i>Don't tell me you don't know.</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:10.266
<i>It's the one-year anniversary</i>
<i>of your sobriety, man.</i>

26:10.335 --> 26:11.768
<i>It's your sober day.</i>

26:11.837 --> 26:13.103
Yeah. I guess it is.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.305
<i>And it's normal</i>

26:15.373 --> 26:16.372
<i>to experience</i>
<i>feelings of anxiety</i>

26:16.441 --> 26:19.242
<i>around this stage, you know?</i>

26:19.311 --> 26:20.643
<i>Are you feeling stressed out?</i>
<i>Are you feeling listless?</i>

26:20.712 --> 26:21.711
<i>You're having</i>
<i>a hard time sleeping, </i>

26:21.780 --> 26:23.046
<i>dealing with your emotions?</i>

26:23.115 --> 26:25.548
<i>Trouble with your memory?</i>

26:25.617 --> 26:28.718
Yeah. That's every day, Joseph.
Look, I've really got to go.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.154
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>this was gonna happen.</i>

26:31.223 --> 26:32.055
What was?

26:33.025 --> 26:34.058
<i>Transference.</i>

26:36.028 --> 26:37.961
Please just talk normal to me
for once.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.863
For fuck's sake,
i can't be googling shit

26:39.932 --> 26:41.231
while I'm driving.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.866
<i>No,</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I...</i>

26:42.935 --> 26:44.201
<i>What I mean is this,</i>

26:44.270 --> 26:46.036
<i>"when you think</i>
<i>that you don't need me,</i>

26:46.105 --> 26:47.671
<i>that's when you really need me."</i>

26:47.740 --> 26:50.674
Who are you, nanny McPhee?

26:50.743 --> 26:54.711
Look, I appreciate your help,
but I don't need it anymore.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.946
I'm healthy. I'm clean.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.215
I don't need a therapist.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.351
<i>So, you have no</i>
<i>other doctor?</i>

27:01.420 --> 27:03.687
<i>It was just me,</i>
<i>and you've stopped therapy?</i>

27:03.756 --> 27:05.288
Yeah. That's what
i keep telling you.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.691
I'm keeping things together
just fine on my own.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.060
There's no one else.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.095
I don't even want
to use anymore.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.396
I'm feeling great.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.831
<i>Good.</i>

27:14.900 --> 27:16.466
<i>You just have</i>
<i>to be careful, Tristan.</i>

27:16.535 --> 27:18.135
I am.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.050
<i>A relapse</i>
<i>can happen in an instant.</i>

27:19.071 --> 27:20.604
<i>In moments, everything you love,</i>

27:21.874 --> 27:23.406
<i>everything you hold dear,</i>
<i>can be taken from you.</i>

27:23.475 --> 27:24.741
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>what I'm telling you?</i>

27:24.810 --> 27:27.977
Yeah. Of course, I do.
I'm not going to relapse.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.445
<i>Okay, well...</i>

27:29.514 --> 27:31.214
<i>And you sound confident</i>
<i>enough about it.</i>

27:31.283 --> 27:33.717
<i>But, before I go, I wanna</i>
<i>tell you a little story.</i>

27:33.786 --> 27:34.785
<i>I think you'll like it.</i>

27:35.420 --> 27:36.820
Do I have a choice?

27:38.390 --> 27:39.823
<i>Yes, of course,</i>
<i>you have a choice.</i>

27:39.892 --> 27:40.937
<i>You see, you always have</i>
<i>a choice.</i>

27:40.960 --> 27:42.826
<i>That's the beauty of it all.</i>

27:42.895 --> 27:43.594
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:44.294
Well, that's a relief.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.065
<i>You're a funny guy.</i>
<i>No wonder people love you.</i>

27:49.701 --> 27:50.667
<i>Okay. So, there was this kid,</i>
<i>Luke Smith,</i>

27:50.736 --> 27:52.368
<i>from... not his real name.</i>

27:52.437 --> 27:55.004
<i>From Jersey, and about your age.</i>

27:55.073 --> 27:56.673
<i>Tough childhood.</i>

27:56.741 --> 27:58.441
<i>Parents beat him,</i>
<i>burned him with cigarettes</i>

27:58.510 --> 28:00.977
<i>when they weren't actually</i>
<i>ignoring him completely.</i>

28:01.046 --> 28:02.412
<i>They were addicts,</i>

28:02.481 --> 28:03.380
<i>so, of course,</i>
<i>he became an addict too.</i>

28:03.448 --> 28:04.748
<i>Like parents, like son, right?</i>

28:04.816 --> 28:06.850
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>by the time he came to me,</i>

28:06.919 --> 28:08.318
<i>he was in a very rough shape.</i>

28:08.387 --> 28:10.020
<i>But he worked on himself,</i>
<i>long and hard.</i>

28:10.088 --> 28:12.288
<i>He stayed committed,</i>
<i>together we got him clean.</i>

28:12.357 --> 28:13.223
<i>I got him clean.</i>

28:13.291 --> 28:14.657
<i>Like I did with you.</i>

28:14.726 --> 28:17.360
<i>And then, much like you,</i>
<i>he met a girl.</i>

28:17.429 --> 28:18.254
<i>An incredible girl.</i>

28:18.297 --> 28:21.030
<i>And he rushed right into things.</i>

28:21.099 --> 28:22.999
<i>He thought he loved her.</i>

28:23.068 --> 28:26.070
<i>But he just loved the idea</i>
<i>of loving her.</i>

28:26.972 --> 28:28.338
<i>But he was fragile,</i>

28:28.407 --> 28:30.039
<i>and he had never</i>
<i>experienced true love,</i>

28:30.108 --> 28:31.474
<i>or any love for that matter.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:32.875
<i>The relationship</i>
<i>was everything to him.</i>

28:32.944 --> 28:34.878
<i>And it was the strength</i>
<i>of the love,</i>

28:34.947 --> 28:36.312
<i>the power of that relationship,</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:37.715
<i>that destroyed him.</i>

28:39.218 --> 28:40.417
<i>At first, I was there</i>
<i>to help him,</i>

28:40.486 --> 28:41.318
<i>but as her hold on him</i>
<i>grew stronger,</i>

28:41.387 --> 28:43.186
<i>he pushed me out.</i>

28:43.254 --> 28:44.287
<i>He told me he was okay,</i>

28:44.356 --> 28:45.655
<i>that he was ready to move on,</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:46.790
<i>he could handle things</i>
<i>on his own.</i>

28:47.859 --> 28:50.293
<i>Any of that sound familiar?</i>

28:50.362 --> 28:52.195
<i>I told him what I told you,</i>
<i>he wouldn't listen.</i>

28:52.264 --> 28:53.797
<i>Had he listened to me,</i>

28:53.866 --> 28:55.165
<i>he would have taken things</i>
<i>a lot slower,</i>

28:55.234 --> 28:57.901
<i>they'd be together today.</i>

28:57.970 --> 28:59.469
<i>Instead, he relapsed,</i>
<i>and she left him,</i>

28:59.538 --> 29:00.937
<i>and he's right back</i>
<i>where he started.</i>

29:01.006 --> 29:02.271
<i>Alone, and a fuckup,</i>
<i>and a loser.</i>

29:03.976 --> 29:05.642
<i>Um, I shouldn't use</i>
<i>that language. I'm sorry.</i>

29:05.711 --> 29:08.545
<i>It's not very therapeutic.</i>
<i>But you get my drift.</i>

29:08.614 --> 29:10.413
Yeah, well, that's that guy.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.881
I'm not that guy.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.484
I'll never go back there again.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.486
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>
<i>you're a confident guy.</i>

29:16.555 --> 29:18.054
<i>And it's very impressive.</i>

29:18.123 --> 29:21.024
<i>But you need</i>
<i>to listen to me, Tristan.</i>

29:21.093 --> 29:23.761
<i>You think you're in control,</i>
<i>and you're not.</i>

29:24.897 --> 29:26.230
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

29:26.298 --> 29:28.097
<i>You are at a critical juncture</i>
<i>in your life.</i>

29:28.166 --> 29:29.599
<i>Things could turn on a dime.</i>

29:29.667 --> 29:30.500
<i>And they could be</i>
<i>turning already.</i>

29:30.568 --> 29:33.504
Joseph, I told you. I'm fine.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.774
<i>Tristan.</i>

29:37.442 --> 29:39.075
<i>I care about you.</i>

29:39.144 --> 29:41.311
<i>All I want is to look out</i>
<i>for your well-being</i>

29:41.380 --> 29:43.112
<i>and protect your best interests.</i>

29:43.181 --> 29:44.781
<i>You've already established</i>

29:44.849 --> 29:47.350
<i>that you can't make decisions</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

29:47.419 --> 29:49.419
<i>You think you're a man,</i>
<i>but you're like a child.</i>

29:50.522 --> 29:51.855
<i>All right.</i>

29:51.923 --> 29:53.256
<i>Look, we'll connect</i>
<i>in person soon.</i>

29:53.325 --> 29:55.058
<i>I just wanna make sure</i>
<i>that you're all right.</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:56.393
Look, Joseph.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.529
Please don't call me again
from a private number.

29:59.598 --> 30:02.632
You know I don't like answering
unknown callers.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.001
You, of all people,
should know that.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.536
<i>Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.</i>

30:06.605 --> 30:07.805
<i>I hear you.</i>

30:09.375 --> 30:10.406
<i>But you must remember</i>
<i>how important...</i>

30:21.453 --> 30:23.419
I really am fine.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.366
<i>Mr. Blake,</i>
<i>it's Dr. lynch again.</i>

30:36.435 --> 30:37.834
<i>I haven't heard from you</i>

30:37.903 --> 30:39.102
<i>and I've had</i>
<i>to leave the office.</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:41.805
<i>It is extremely urgent</i>
<i>that we speak.</i>

30:41.874 --> 30:43.574
<i>I will be available</i>
<i>on my home line all night,</i>

30:43.642 --> 30:46.309
<i>so please, at your earliest</i>
<i>possible convenience,</i>

30:46.378 --> 30:47.410
<i>return my call.</i>

30:47.479 --> 30:48.845
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:48.914 --> 30:51.982
Will probably cost me triple
calling her at the house.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.747
<i>Tristan.</i>

31:23.815 --> 31:26.516
<i>Tristan, how long</i>
<i>have we known each other?</i>

31:26.585 --> 31:29.185
<i>How long have I slaved away</i>
<i>on your behalf?</i>

31:29.254 --> 31:31.120
<i>And, and after all</i>
<i>we've been through,</i>

31:31.189 --> 31:33.122
<i>this, this is how you treat me?</i>

31:33.191 --> 31:35.091
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you're unbelievable, man.</i>

31:35.160 --> 31:37.560
Richard, come on.
You're getting hysterical.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.730
<i>Yeah? Well, the truth</i>
<i>makes me hysterical, Tristan.</i>

31:40.799 --> 31:44.000
The truth is, you're my agent.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.269
So, deal with this.
This is the gig.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.372
<i>Tristan, I'm an agent,</i>
<i>not a fucking genie.</i>

31:49.441 --> 31:52.375
<i>Okay, it's a 100-million-dollar</i>
<i>production, dude.</i>

31:52.444 --> 31:53.677
<i>You're out of your mind!</i>

31:53.745 --> 31:56.579
I told you my availability
when we made this deal.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.482
I couldn't make it to set
until tomorrow.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.219
I was crystal clear.
What didn't you understand?

32:03.288 --> 32:05.755
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I thought you were joking.</i>

32:05.824 --> 32:08.524
<i>Okay, we all did.</i>
<i>For god's sakes.</i>

32:08.593 --> 32:11.227
<i>Joking, or high.</i>

32:11.296 --> 32:14.397
- Richard, come on.
<i>- -No, no. You come on.</i>

32:14.466 --> 32:17.667
<i>When a huge studio</i>
<i>says they need you on a set</i>

32:17.736 --> 32:19.769
<i>at a certain time,</i>
<i>on a certain day,</i>

32:19.838 --> 32:22.405
<i>and they're paying you</i>
<i>ten million dollars to be there,</i>

32:22.474 --> 32:25.441
<i>you cancel your fucking facial,</i>
<i>throw your shit in a bag,</i>

32:25.510 --> 32:26.909
<i>and fly a day early.</i>

32:26.978 --> 32:28.711
- And I don't get a say?
- -<i>No! You don't.</i>

32:28.780 --> 32:31.681
<i>You do not. You're putting</i>
<i>this project on the line.</i>

32:31.750 --> 32:34.484
<i>And by project,</i>
<i>I mean, your ass.</i>

32:34.553 --> 32:36.552
<i>Okay, I, I don't wanna</i>
<i>hurt your feelings,</i>

32:36.621 --> 32:38.321
-<i>but this sounds more like...</i>
-What? Sounds what?

32:38.356 --> 32:39.388
Sounds more Hemingway?

32:39.457 --> 32:42.626
<i>Yes. It does, okay?</i>

32:43.595 --> 32:44.627
<i>And he'll be calling.</i>

32:44.696 --> 32:45.828
I doubt that.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.131
Alex doesn't have
my number. Thank fuck.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.399
<i>He does now.</i>

32:49.468 --> 32:51.068
Excuse me?

32:51.136 --> 32:53.269
<i>Hey, if I didn't,</i>
<i>he threatened to leave.</i>

32:53.338 --> 32:55.071
Maybe, you should
represent talent

32:55.140 --> 32:56.439
that doesn't threaten then.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.841
<i>Threaten what?</i>
<i>My livelihood?</i>

32:57.909 --> 32:58.714
<i>Is that like</i>
<i>you're doing right now?</i>

32:58.744 --> 33:01.211
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

33:01.280 --> 33:02.512
<i>But I'll take that</i>
<i>into consideration</i>

33:02.581 --> 33:03.679
<i>the next time I take on</i>
<i>a rising star.</i>

33:03.749 --> 33:05.982
It's Hollywood.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.583
Everyone's a rising star
until they start falling.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.651
<i>He's different.</i>

33:08.720 --> 33:10.520
Of course, he is.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.456
He has his agent
helping him ride the coattails

33:13.525 --> 33:15.324
of his number one client.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.227
Wouldn't that be great, Richard,
if we all had that?

33:18.296 --> 33:20.430
A free fucking ride to the top.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.631
Everyone would be a star.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.233
We'd run out of room
on the fucking posters.

33:24.302 --> 33:25.601
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>give him a break.</i>

33:25.670 --> 33:26.936
<i>He's a good kid.</i>

33:27.005 --> 33:29.705
He's an empty-headed dollar
sign, that's what he is.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.477
Is he the 6-1-7 calling?

33:34.546 --> 33:37.113
The shit show now begins,
thanks to you, Richard.

33:37.182 --> 33:40.383
<i>Tristan, please,</i>
<i>don't fuck this up for me.</i>

33:40.452 --> 33:41.484
<i>I'm overextended.</i>

33:41.553 --> 33:42.786
<i>The cars, tricia's surgeries,</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:44.387
<i>the kids' schools, that dui...</i>

33:44.456 --> 33:47.156
<i>The bank's gonna foreclose</i>
<i>on my house. </i>

33:47.225 --> 33:48.224
<i>You wanna see me</i>

33:48.293 --> 33:49.759
<i>and my family homeless?</i>

33:49.828 --> 33:51.694
Screw you, Richard.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.530
You make more money
than I do, for fuck's sake.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.533
<i>Yeah, fuck. I do.</i>

33:57.602 --> 33:58.668
<i>Look. Whatever. All right?</i>

33:58.736 --> 33:59.902
<i>Just fix it.</i>

33:59.971 --> 34:02.371
<i>For all our sakes. Please.</i>

34:02.440 --> 34:04.307
And why am I doing
your job again?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.375
<i>Hey, I tried.</i>

34:06.444 --> 34:08.377
<i>I've been on</i>
<i>the goddamn phone all morning,</i>

34:08.446 --> 34:09.612
<i>but I'm just one man, okay?</i>

34:09.681 --> 34:11.714
<i>There's only so much I can do.</i>

34:11.783 --> 34:14.784
<i>Now, just talk to Hemingway.</i>
<i>Calm him down.</i>

34:14.853 --> 34:16.186
<i>We can't lose this one.</i>

34:17.222 --> 34:19.355
We can't? Or ye can't?

34:19.424 --> 34:21.357
<i>We! Look, after this,</i>

34:21.426 --> 34:22.792
<i>you can go right back to those</i>

34:22.860 --> 34:25.629
<i>independent low-budget</i>
<i>heaps of shit you love so much.</i>

34:26.398 --> 34:27.864
<i>Do this film, pal,</i>

34:27.933 --> 34:29.532
<i>and your career is bulletproof.</i>

34:29.601 --> 34:31.701
Jesus.
Some fucking agent you are.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.303
<i>What a client you are.</i>

34:33.371 --> 34:35.670
<i>Help me out on this one.</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

34:35.739 --> 34:36.973
You always beg.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.876
You're a money-crazed puppy
in a brioni suit.

34:39.945 --> 34:43.411
<i>So what? So what?</i>
<i>This is it. Last one, okay?</i>

34:43.481 --> 34:45.815
And don't be giving out
my numbers to strangers again.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.550
I have to go get a new one now.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.553
It's a pain in the fucking hole.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.487
<i>What?</i>
<i>Who, who did I give it out to?</i>

34:52.556 --> 34:53.889
- Joseph.
- -<i>Yeah.</i>

34:53.958 --> 34:55.291
<i>Well, I thought</i>
<i>that would be okay.</i>

34:55.360 --> 34:57.793
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he's your therapist, right?</i>

34:57.862 --> 35:00.530
He was my therapist. Past tense.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.432
Next time, run it by me.

35:04.335 --> 35:07.237
Have to go. Wee pest is on
the other line, thanks to you.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.774
<i>About fucking time</i>
<i>you answered!</i>

35:11.977 --> 35:14.577
- I'm sorry. Who is this?
- -

35:14.646 --> 35:16.846
<i>Hey, you know what? Okay, look.</i>
<i>I'm not sure how they do things</i>

35:16.915 --> 35:18.347
<i>back in potato-ville,</i>
<i>but out here...</i>

35:18.416 --> 35:19.715
"Potato-ville"?

35:19.784 --> 35:22.218
If I can remember correctly,
we built your country.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.753
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>

35:23.822 --> 35:25.021
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>the full fucking resumé later,</i>

35:25.090 --> 35:26.356
<i>starting with the fact</i>
<i>that I've been</i>

35:27.426 --> 35:28.558
<i>under contract</i>
<i>at Warner's for...</i>

35:28.627 --> 35:30.026
Sounds like you skipped
straight to the resumé.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.594
<i>You know,</i>
<i>at least mine</i>

35:31.663 --> 35:33.630
<i>doesn't have</i>
<i>a train wreck at the top.</i>

35:33.699 --> 35:34.631
<i>What, tell me yours again?</i>

35:34.700 --> 35:36.232
<i>Every drug known to man,</i>

35:36.301 --> 35:38.902
<i>a Maserati facedown</i>
<i>in a swimming pool,</i>

35:38.970 --> 35:40.370
<i>more abortions</i>
<i>than the catholic church,</i>

35:40.438 --> 35:41.638
<i>a fucking bicycle wreck</i>
<i>that almost killed you.</i>

35:41.706 --> 35:43.973
- A motorbike.
- -<i>What?</i>

35:44.042 --> 35:44.707
- It was a motorbike.
<i>- That's what I said.</i>

35:44.776 --> 35:45.875
No, you said a bicycle.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.945
You see, a motorbike
is like a bicycle,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.646
except with a motor.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.249
Hence, why they call it
a motorbike.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.617
<i>Jesus fucking...</i>

35:54.686 --> 35:56.085
<i>I know</i>
<i>what a fucking motorbike is.</i>

35:56.154 --> 35:58.755
- I'm just making sure.
- -<i>Whatever!</i>

35:58.824 --> 36:00.323
<i>Look, for as long</i>
<i>as you've been doing this,</i>

36:00.392 --> 36:03.226
<i>apparently, you haven't learn</i>
<i>one fucking thing about the biz.</i>

36:04.530 --> 36:06.229
- Listen, tre.
- -<i>Hey.</i>

36:06.298 --> 36:07.763
<i>Only my family calls me that.</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:11.334
I'm happy you finally got
a taste of success.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.502
But that doesn't mean

36:12.571 --> 36:14.904
you can go around
threatening people.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.906
That's just not how it works.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.441
<i>"How it works"? Wait, wait...</i>

36:18.510 --> 36:20.376
<i>You think you know this town</i>
<i>better than me?</i>

36:20.445 --> 36:21.477
No. I'm not saying

36:21.546 --> 36:23.479
that's not how it works
in this town.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.549
I'm saying,
that's not how it works, period!

36:26.618 --> 36:28.084
<i>Fuck you, Blake!</i>

36:28.153 --> 36:29.519
<i>Since Richard didn't have</i>
<i>the balls</i>

36:29.588 --> 36:31.588
<i>to explain shit to you before,</i>
<i>I'll do it now.</i>

36:32.324 --> 36:33.790
<i>I never liked you.</i>

36:33.859 --> 36:35.992
<i>I wasn't a fan then,</i>
<i>and I'm certainly not a fan now.</i>

36:36.061 --> 36:37.661
<i>The only reason I took this job</i>

36:37.729 --> 36:40.563
<i>was to work with this director</i>
<i>to enhance my career.</i>

36:40.632 --> 36:41.965
<i>I definitely didn't do it</i>

36:42.033 --> 36:42.988
<i>to work</i>
<i>with a deadbeat drug addict</i>

36:43.001 --> 36:45.368
<i>that despite his many fuckups,</i>

36:45.437 --> 36:46.836
<i>everyone still seems to like.</i>

36:46.905 --> 36:48.505
<i>Why? I don't fucking know.</i>

36:48.573 --> 36:49.839
<i>It's a fucking mystery to me,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

36:49.908 --> 36:53.776
The only reason you got the job
in the first place, tre,

36:53.845 --> 36:56.412
is because
this deadbeat drug addict

36:56.481 --> 36:58.614
allowed his pussy of an agent

36:58.683 --> 37:02.018
to piggyback
his fucking pussy of a client

37:02.087 --> 37:05.054
on top of me
as part of the deal.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.422
- <i>Bullshit!</i>
- Ask him.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.391
- <i>I will.</i>
- Enjoy.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.861
- By the way...
- -<i>What?</i>

37:11.930 --> 37:13.163
Our on-screen tension

37:13.231 --> 37:15.831
is gonna come across
quite authentic tomorrow.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.733
Which should
benefit you perfectly.

37:17.802 --> 37:20.703
Because your acting
is utter shite.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.071
<i>Fuck you, Blake!</i>

37:22.140 --> 37:23.440
<i>I'm gonna fucking...</i>

37:24.976 --> 37:26.108
Enough of him for one day.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.920
Fuck that shitehead.

38:02.814 --> 38:03.813
<i>Tristan.</i>

38:03.882 --> 38:05.281
- Hey.
- -<i>Hi.</i>

38:05.350 --> 38:08.017
<i>You finally have time for me.</i>

38:08.086 --> 38:10.019
Yeah, sorry.
It's been a crazy day.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.454
Everything okay?

38:11.523 --> 38:13.022
<i>-yeah.</i>

38:13.091 --> 38:14.224
<i>I just wanted to see</i>
<i>how you're doing.</i>

38:14.292 --> 38:16.992
I've been better,
if you want the truth.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.027
<i>You haven't...</i>

38:18.096 --> 38:19.962
No, no.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.464
Nothing like that.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.133
Just work.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.501
<i>I see you're doing</i>
<i>a new big budget movie.</i>

38:25.570 --> 38:27.403
<i>That's exciting.</i>

38:27.472 --> 38:28.938
<i>Everyone here's raving about it.</i>

38:29.007 --> 38:30.473
I guess it is big.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.376
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

38:33.445 --> 38:35.077
<i>You never got excited</i>
<i>about anything.</i>

38:36.214 --> 38:37.413
<i>When do you start?</i>

38:37.482 --> 38:40.383
Actually, that's where
the "been better" is.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.685
<i>What do you mean?</i>

38:41.753 --> 38:44.019
Just a mix-up
with work dates, that's all.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.655
Some stupid Hollywood thing.

38:46.724 --> 38:49.458
- Should all work out okay.
- -<i>Why?</i>

38:49.527 --> 38:51.060
<i>What have you gone</i>
<i>and done now, Tristan?</i>

38:51.129 --> 38:52.395
I've done nothing.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.896
<i>Well, it can't be nothing</i>

38:53.965 --> 38:55.231
<i>if there's a problem,</i>
<i>now, can it?</i>

38:56.501 --> 38:58.401
I'm just doing what I want to do
for once in my life.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.935
Not what everyone else
wants me to do

39:00.004 --> 39:01.537
for their own benefit.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.138
<i>Please.</i>
<i>When is that new?</i>

39:03.207 --> 39:06.475
<i>Look, whatever it is,</i>
<i>just fix it, okay?</i>

39:06.544 --> 39:07.643
Don't worry, siobhán.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.446
The golden goose
will still lay when asked.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.082
<i>The fucking cheek of it!</i>

39:13.151 --> 39:14.183
Well, you only call
when you want something.

39:14.252 --> 39:15.918
So, what else
am I supposed to think?

39:15.987 --> 39:18.921
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Always right. Always right!</i>

39:18.990 --> 39:21.090
- Well, fucking, aren't I?
- -<i>No.</i>

39:21.159 --> 39:22.392
<i>You fucking aren't!</i>

39:22.460 --> 39:25.094
Siobhán! Is there anything
you want in particular?

39:25.163 --> 39:27.696
<i>Too busy</i>
<i>for family now. Is that it?</i>

39:27.765 --> 39:30.699
<i>And, no, there is nothing</i>
<i>I want from you, Tristan.</i>

39:30.768 --> 39:32.034
<i>I was just checking in on you.</i>

39:32.103 --> 39:33.903
<i>Checking in on my brother.</i>

39:33.972 --> 39:34.970
<i>Is that a crime?</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:35.884
You sure about that?

39:35.907 --> 39:38.007
<i>Fuck you, Tristan!</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:40.042
Okay. Gotta go.
Talk to you later, sis.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.177
Love you. Goodbye.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.979
<i>Tristan...</i>

39:44.048 --> 39:46.949
<i>So, how is</i>
<i>Hollywood's main attraction</i>

39:47.018 --> 39:48.284
<i>of constant fuckups?</i>

39:48.353 --> 39:51.987
Splendid. How is Hollywood's
most sarcastic cunt?

39:52.056 --> 39:55.224
<i>Fantastic!</i>
<i>So, a no-show again.</i>

39:55.293 --> 39:56.726
<i>Well done. At least this time</i>

39:56.794 --> 39:58.961
<i>we can go out</i>
<i>in a Blaze of glory.</i>

39:59.030 --> 40:00.396
We'll be okay.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.499
I told them I wouldn't be in
on day one, so this time,

40:03.568 --> 40:05.601
I'm actually in the right.
Can you believe it?

40:05.670 --> 40:07.370
<i>No, Tristan, I can't.</i>

40:07.438 --> 40:10.072
<i>Skipping a 100-million-dollar</i>
<i>feature on day one,</i>

40:10.141 --> 40:11.941
<i>you better be well</i>
<i>in the fucking right.</i>

40:12.010 --> 40:14.243
I am, this time. I really am.

40:14.312 --> 40:17.012
<i>Tristan, don't you go</i>
<i>fucking lying to me.</i>

40:17.081 --> 40:18.681
I'm serious, honestly.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.483
<i>All right, okay.</i>

40:20.552 --> 40:21.918
<i>So, what is so important that</i>
<i>you're missing your first day?</i>

40:21.987 --> 40:24.320
<i>And, more importantly,</i>
<i>how come I don't know about it?</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:26.789
- It's personal.
- -<i>Fuck personal.</i>

40:26.858 --> 40:29.258
<i>I've been dealing with</i>
<i>your personal shit for years.</i>

40:29.327 --> 40:30.726
<i>Give me a cock, a beard,</i>
<i>and that accent,</i>

40:30.795 --> 40:33.729
<i>and I could practically be you,</i>
<i>so what the fuck is it?</i>

40:37.569 --> 40:38.568
Caitlin.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.203
<i>Wah!</i>

40:41.272 --> 40:43.506
Just say it, Louise.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.841
<i>Not that grinning, all-nice,</i>

40:45.910 --> 40:47.376
<i>walking bowl of frosting</i>

40:47.445 --> 40:48.911
<i>pretending to help people</i>
<i>and shit,</i>

40:48.980 --> 40:51.380
<i>bitch of a Southern cupcake!</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:55.050
First off, she's a doctor.
So helping people is her job.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.186
Secondly,
you haven't even met her.

40:57.255 --> 41:00.856
But she's the Southern bitch
i happen to love, Louise.

41:00.925 --> 41:03.192
So please, go easy on her.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.293
<i>Please.</i>

41:04.362 --> 41:05.928
<i>I've met way more than enough</i>

41:05.997 --> 41:08.931
<i>coming and going over the years</i>
<i>to know it will not last.</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:11.200
<i>And I've gone easy on you,</i>
<i>way too fucking easy.</i>

41:11.269 --> 41:13.736
- This one is different.
- -<i>Look.</i>

41:13.805 --> 41:15.070
<i>It's you</i>
<i>that I care about, okay?</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:16.805
<i>Not some Southern peach</i>

41:16.874 --> 41:18.207
<i>looking to spend her days</i>
<i>strolling rodeo drive</i>

41:18.275 --> 41:19.125
<i>and telling her friends</i>
<i>on Facebook</i>

41:19.143 --> 41:21.778
<i>from her hometown of 50</i>

41:21.847 --> 41:22.545
<i>that she's made it</i>
<i>to the big time.</i>

41:22.614 --> 41:24.047
Always so supportive.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.315
<i>Well, I was supportive</i>
<i>with Sarah,</i>

41:26.384 --> 41:27.817
<i>who actually wasn't that bad,</i>

41:27.885 --> 41:30.219
<i>until she ran off with your cat</i>
<i>and your new car.</i>

41:30.288 --> 41:32.021
<i>I was semi-hesitant</i>
<i>with Patricia,</i>

41:32.090 --> 41:33.589
<i>but only because with that body,</i>

41:33.658 --> 41:35.391
<i>I would have fucked</i>
<i>that girl myself.</i>

41:35.460 --> 41:37.259
<i>But, good god, she would have</i>
<i>snorted up Jack frost</i>

41:37.328 --> 41:38.127
<i>if she had the chance.</i>

41:38.196 --> 41:39.895
<i>And, finally, Tara.</i>

41:39.964 --> 41:42.831
<i>The best of the lot,</i>
<i>good ol' Tara. Remember Tara?</i>

41:42.900 --> 41:44.433
<i>She managed, in a single month,</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:47.136
<i>to fuck your co-star,</i>
<i>blame you for it,</i>

41:47.205 --> 41:48.805
<i>blackmail you</i>
<i>for thousands of dollars,</i>

41:48.873 --> 41:51.840
<i>and, wait a minute, I think</i>
<i>she actually did fuck Patricia.</i>

41:51.909 --> 41:52.975
Yeah.

41:53.043 --> 41:54.777
She wasn't one
of the best decisions

41:54.846 --> 41:56.679
I've ever made, all right?

41:56.748 --> 41:59.248
<i>Like you've ever made</i>
<i>any good decisions, Tristan.</i>

41:59.317 --> 42:01.817
<i>Where do you find these girls?</i>
<i>Seriously!</i>

42:01.886 --> 42:03.652
<i>Okay, will you just please</i>

42:03.721 --> 42:06.221
<i>promise me that you'll try</i>
<i>not to do something stupid.</i>

42:06.290 --> 42:07.356
<i>Like, I don't know...</i>

42:07.425 --> 42:08.658
<i>Marry it?</i>

42:10.395 --> 42:13.329
- Louise.
- -<i>God, what?</i>

42:13.398 --> 42:16.765
When people aren't too sure,
they walk.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.200
When I'm not too sure...

42:18.269 --> 42:19.468
<i>No, you run and jump.</i>

42:19.537 --> 42:22.271
<i>You stupid Irish fuck.</i>

42:22.340 --> 42:23.806
<i>God!</i>

42:25.610 --> 42:27.076
<i>All right. Well, I just better</i>
<i>go prepare damage control,</i>

42:27.145 --> 42:27.944
<i>in case the worst</i>
<i>ends up happening,</i>

42:29.014 --> 42:31.246
<i>which is absolutely inevitable.</i>

42:31.315 --> 42:33.282
<i>And, also, why haven't you</i>
<i>hired an assistant yet?</i>

42:33.351 --> 42:34.650
Why would I?

42:34.719 --> 42:37.753
When I have my guardian angel
always looking over me.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.388
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>
<i>You can't afford me.</i>

43:06.017 --> 43:08.317
- Dad?
- -<i>Hello?</i>

43:08.386 --> 43:10.386
- Yeah, dad?
- -<i>That you, Tristan?</i>

43:10.455 --> 43:13.022
It is. Everything all right?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.024
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Everything's grand.</i>

43:15.093 --> 43:17.192
- Are you sure?
- -<i>Yeah, no, I'm positive.</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:19.194
<i>Hey, it's my job</i>
<i>to worry about you.</i>

43:19.263 --> 43:20.295
<i>Not the other way around.</i>

43:20.364 --> 43:21.364
I know.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.334
- So?
- -<i>So what?</i>

43:25.403 --> 43:27.136
You called me, dad.

43:27.205 --> 43:28.871
<i>Yeah, yeah. No.</i>

43:28.940 --> 43:32.074
<i>I seen you on the telly there,</i>
<i>doing an interview and...</i>

43:32.143 --> 43:33.976
<i>The weather looks great</i>
<i>out there.</i>

43:34.045 --> 43:36.311
Yeah. It's always sunny,
all right.

43:36.380 --> 43:39.281
<i>Yeah. No wonder</i>
<i>you never want to come home. Ha!</i>

43:39.350 --> 43:42.885
<i>Anyway, I decided</i>
<i>and I think I should go.</i>

43:42.954 --> 43:44.420
Go where, dad?

43:44.489 --> 43:46.022
<i>I should go over</i>
<i>to America to see you.</i>

43:47.925 --> 43:49.792
- What?
<i>- What do you mean, "what?"</i>

43:49.860 --> 43:53.829
<i>I've just told you. I'm going</i>
<i>to come visit you in America.</i>

43:53.898 --> 43:56.265
- Are you sure?
<i>- Yes, of course, I'm sure.</i>

43:57.001 --> 43:58.934
It's just la is far,

43:59.003 --> 44:00.569
and it wasn't fair
for me to ask you.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.305
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>I think it'll be good to go.</i>

44:03.374 --> 44:05.107
<i>Right? And I, I could</i>
<i>get someone here to,</i>

44:05.176 --> 44:07.009
<i>to look after the farm</i>
<i>while I'm gone.</i>

44:07.078 --> 44:09.111
Of course. Sure, Declan
will look after that for you.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.713
<i>Aye, aye. Now...</i>

44:10.782 --> 44:13.482
<i>What's the best way</i>
<i>for me to get there?</i>

44:13.551 --> 44:15.384
<i>You still there, Tristan?</i>

44:15.453 --> 44:17.853
Yeah, yeah. Listen, no worries.

44:17.922 --> 44:20.255
I'll book the ticket
and sort out everything for you.

44:20.324 --> 44:23.025
All you need to do is ask Susan,

44:23.094 --> 44:26.328
and make sure your passport
is still valid, all right?

44:26.397 --> 44:28.997
Actually, will you get Susan
on the phone there for me, dad?

44:30.434 --> 44:31.433
You're gonna love it out here.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.836
And I can't wait for you
to meet Caitlin.

44:34.572 --> 44:35.704
Jesus, dad. I've been...

44:35.773 --> 44:38.107
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.375
Now that you're feeling better,

44:39.444 --> 44:40.309
- I'll be able to bring you
-<i>who?</i>

44:40.378 --> 44:41.277
To all the sites
we talked about.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.813
<i>Who... who is this?</i>

44:45.883 --> 44:47.916
- What?
- -<i>Who is this?</i>

44:47.985 --> 44:49.952
- It's Tristan.
- -<i>Who?</i>

44:51.389 --> 44:52.422
Tristan.

44:54.325 --> 44:55.390
<i>Tristan?</i>

44:55.459 --> 44:57.526
Yes, dad. It's Tristan.

44:57.595 --> 45:00.095
<i>I... yeah, um...</i>

45:00.164 --> 45:02.030
<i>I don't know any Tristan.</i>

45:02.099 --> 45:03.632
Yes, you do. I'm your son.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.400
<i>No, no. I don't...</i>
<i>I don't have a son.</i>

45:05.469 --> 45:09.104
<i>Is this some kind of joke,</i>
<i>is it? Who is this?</i>

45:09.173 --> 45:11.273
Dad, calm down.

45:11.342 --> 45:12.908
You called me.

45:12.977 --> 45:15.878
- <i>It's your son, Jim.</i>
<i>- Who are you?</i>

45:15.947 --> 45:17.446
<i>Jim, I'm Susan,</i>
<i>you're nurse.</i>

45:17.515 --> 45:19.782
<i>And on the phone</i>
<i>is your son, Tristan.</i>

45:19.851 --> 45:21.084
<i>That is your son, Tristan.</i>

45:21.152 --> 45:22.618
<i>Well, I have no son.</i>

45:22.687 --> 45:23.586
<i>Just give me</i>
<i>the phone, Jim, please.</i>

45:23.655 --> 45:25.988
<i>No, no, no.</i>

45:26.056 --> 45:27.856
<i>You're not getting...</i>

45:27.925 --> 45:28.490
<i>Jim, be a good man,</i>
<i>now, just give me the phone.</i>

45:31.061 --> 45:32.060
<i>Hello, Tristan.</i>

45:32.129 --> 45:33.095
Yeah, Susan,
is everything all right?

45:33.163 --> 45:35.898
<i>Yeah, listen, Tristan.</i>

45:35.967 --> 45:37.400
<i>Your father is in no condition</i>
<i>to talk right now.</i>

45:37.469 --> 45:38.701
<i>I'm really sorry. It's just not</i>
<i>a good time, okay?</i>

45:38.770 --> 45:41.370
<i>Where's my jacket?</i>

45:41.438 --> 45:42.771
<i>Where's my jacket?</i>
<i>I have to feed the cows.</i>

45:42.840 --> 45:44.139
<i>There are cows that need feeding</i>
<i>at the park.</i>

45:44.208 --> 45:46.375
- <i>Jim.</i>
<i>- You have it?</i>

45:46.443 --> 45:47.509
<i>Jim, come here to me now.</i>

45:47.578 --> 45:49.144
- <i>Why?</i>
<i>- Jim...</i>

45:49.213 --> 45:51.848
<i>Where the bloody hell</i>
<i>is my jacket?</i>

45:51.916 --> 45:52.982
- <i>Where?</i>
<i>- So sorry, Tristan. Jim!</i>

45:53.051 --> 45:53.583
<i>Jim!</i>

46:25.516 --> 46:29.351
Look, Hemingway, I'm really not
in the fucking mood.

46:29.420 --> 46:31.053
<i>Hemingway?</i>

46:31.122 --> 46:32.387
<i>Who's Hemingway?</i>

46:32.456 --> 46:36.025
Come on. Fuck off, Joseph!

46:51.042 --> 46:52.307
<i>...makes smarter movies.</i>

46:52.376 --> 46:53.609
<i>I guess that's what I'm saying.</i>

46:53.678 --> 46:56.511
<i>We're not idiots, Hollywood.</i>

46:56.580 --> 46:58.046
<i>Although, maybe we are.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

46:58.115 --> 46:59.948
<i>People keep paying</i>
<i>to see this crap.</i>

47:00.017 --> 47:01.450
<i>So, yeah. Okay.</i>

47:01.518 --> 47:02.651
<i>You win, Hollywood.</i>
<i>We're idiots.</i>

47:02.720 --> 47:05.187
<i>All right, that was cru</i>

47:05.256 --> 47:06.521
<i>from north Hollywood</i>
<i>who was, well...</i>

47:06.590 --> 47:08.590
<i>Frank, to say the least.</i>

47:08.659 --> 47:10.659
<i>The next film up</i>
<i>is sunset parking,</i>

47:10.728 --> 47:13.428
<i>starring that Irish fox,</i>
<i>Tristan Blake.</i>

47:13.497 --> 47:15.030
<i>Now, as you all know,</i>

47:15.099 --> 47:16.899
<i>Blake had his share</i>
<i>of personal troubles</i>

47:16.968 --> 47:18.434
<i>over the past few years.</i>

47:18.503 --> 47:21.169
<i>But, apparently, he's cleaned up</i>
<i>and loaded for bear</i>

47:21.238 --> 47:23.438
<i>in his new flick, which opened</i>
<i>this past weekend.</i>

47:23.507 --> 47:24.906
<i>And if you saw it,</i>
<i>we wanna hear from you.</i>

47:24.975 --> 47:26.274
<i>We've got a caller</i>
<i>on the line right now,</i>

47:26.343 --> 47:29.077
<i>"Barry in chino hills,"</i>
<i>you there?</i>

47:29.146 --> 47:30.779
<i>Yo!</i>

47:30.848 --> 47:32.347
<i>What's your opinion</i>
<i>on</i> sunset parking?

47:32.416 --> 47:35.150
<i>And try to go easy. Blake's had </i>
<i>a rough ride of late.</i>

47:35.219 --> 47:37.286
<i>Ha, he's given a few</i>
<i>rough rides, as of late.</i>

47:37.355 --> 47:39.521
<i>Am I right? I saw that sex tape.</i>

47:39.590 --> 47:41.690
<i>Yes! Now that</i>
<i>was a blockbuster.</i>

47:43.327 --> 47:43.859
<i>He busted something,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

47:44.962 --> 47:47.362
<i>Barry. Shoot.</i>

47:47.431 --> 47:48.430
<i>I just don't know why Blake</i>

47:48.499 --> 47:49.798
<i>is doing these films again.</i>

47:49.867 --> 47:50.766
<i>It's like the same</i>
<i>big-budget crap</i>

47:50.835 --> 47:53.235
<i>and it's getting old.</i>

47:53.304 --> 47:54.837
<i>Now, don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I like the guy.</i>

47:54.905 --> 47:55.871
<i>He seems down to earth</i>
<i>and he can obviously act.</i>

47:55.940 --> 47:58.440
<i>But he's run out of ideas.</i>

47:58.509 --> 47:59.341
<i>Well, it does seem </i>
<i>to be doing well</i>

47:59.410 --> 48:00.376
<i>at the box office.</i>

48:00.444 --> 48:01.710
<i>Of course, it is.</i>

48:01.779 --> 48:04.279
<i>With all the promotion</i>
<i>behind it,</i>

48:04.348 --> 48:05.180
he could star in
<i>et versus spiderman</i>

48:05.249 --> 48:06.281
<i>and make money...</i>

48:06.350 --> 48:08.851
<i>Playing et.</i>

48:08.919 --> 48:10.619
<i>So, thumbs down</i>
<i>for Barry.</i>

48:10.688 --> 48:12.221
<i>Blake used to do all</i>
<i>these cool independent movies.</i>

48:12.289 --> 48:14.156
<i>They weren't</i>
<i>big Hollywood blockbusters,</i>

48:14.225 --> 48:15.024
<i>but they had class.</i>

48:15.092 --> 48:15.924
<i>They had a bit of soul.</i>

48:15.993 --> 48:17.660
<i>I don't know, man.</i>

48:17.728 --> 48:20.362
<i>Blake just seems like</i>
<i>he's in it for the money.</i>

48:20.431 --> 48:21.930
<i>Maybe he's lost it,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

48:21.999 --> 48:24.666
<i>You hear that Blake?</i>
<i>If you are listening,</i>

48:24.735 --> 48:25.701
<i>Barry feels you need</i>
<i>to go back to your old ways,</i>

48:25.770 --> 48:27.102
<i>and stop being a sellout.</i>

48:27.171 --> 48:29.037
<i>Do we have time</i>
<i>for one more caller?</i>

48:29.106 --> 48:30.372
<i>We do. Hello!</i>

48:30.441 --> 48:31.707
<i>Hi, hi!</i>

48:31.776 --> 48:32.775
<i>And who do we have here?</i>

48:32.843 --> 48:34.310
<i>My name's Heather.</i>

48:34.378 --> 48:36.979
<i>Longtime listener,</i>
<i>first time caller.</i>

48:37.048 --> 48:38.514
<i>Hello, Heather.</i>
<i>So, where are you from?</i>

48:38.583 --> 48:41.250
<i>And what you do for a living?</i>

48:41.318 --> 48:42.951
<i>I'm an actress</i>
<i>from long beach.</i>

48:43.020 --> 48:44.453
<i>So, are you</i>
<i>a real actress, Heather?</i>

48:44.522 --> 48:47.156
<i>Or is it a</i>
<i>"you take acting classes</i>

48:47.224 --> 48:48.490
<i>and tell your friends</i>
<i>you were once at the gym</i>

48:48.559 --> 48:50.092
<i>with Leo DiCaprio"</i>
<i>kind of thing?</i>

48:50.161 --> 48:52.995
<i>I actually act</i>
<i>on a series.</i>

48:53.064 --> 48:54.630
- <i>It's called</i> fractal <i>.</i>
<i>- </i>

48:54.699 --> 48:55.698
<i>It's on</i>
<i>the science fiction network.</i>

48:55.766 --> 48:58.567
<i>Aliens and stuff, you know?</i>

48:58.636 --> 48:59.968
<i>Cool. We've got</i>
<i>a professional opinion.</i>

49:00.037 --> 49:02.738
<i>So, let's hear it, Heather.</i>

49:02.807 --> 49:04.373
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>This is what I have to say.</i>

49:04.442 --> 49:06.041
<i>In order to do these</i>
<i>low-budget independent movies,</i>

49:06.110 --> 49:08.310
<i>Blake has to occasionally do</i>
<i>big-budget crap.</i>

49:08.379 --> 49:10.179
-Exactly.
-<i>'Cause it's an art form,</i>

49:10.247 --> 49:11.780
<i>of course, but at the end</i>
<i>of the day, it's still a job.</i>

49:11.849 --> 49:15.183
<i>So, if it takes a pile</i>
<i>of crap commercial movies</i>

49:15.252 --> 49:17.319
<i>for him to give us his time,</i>
<i>for free,</i>

49:17.388 --> 49:20.489
<i>in some kick-ass independent,</i>
<i>I, for one, support it.</i>

49:20.558 --> 49:22.691
<i>I mean, yeah,</i>
<i>he's had his problems.</i>

49:22.760 --> 49:24.226
<i>But, unh, we all have.</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:25.628
<i>He's still managed</i>
<i>to stay authentic.</i>

49:25.696 --> 49:28.464
<i>It's hard to do</i>
<i>in this day and age.</i>

49:28.532 --> 49:30.099
<i>Love it!</i>
<i>Personally, I liked the film, </i>

49:30.167 --> 49:31.633
<i>but I would watch that guy read</i>
<i>the back of a cereal box,</i>

49:31.702 --> 49:35.303
<i>take off his shirt,</i>
<i>and with that accent, I'm sold.</i>

49:35.372 --> 49:37.372
<i>Big budget, small budget,</i>
<i>no budget,</i>

49:37.441 --> 49:39.441
<i>iPhone sex tape, I am in.</i>

49:39.510 --> 49:41.644
<i>All right, stay...</i>

49:46.117 --> 49:47.315
<i>Tristan, my man.</i>

49:48.819 --> 49:50.585
Jerry, buddy. What's going on?

49:50.654 --> 49:53.588
<i>Chilling at the house,</i>
<i>having a few beers. Listen.</i>

49:53.657 --> 49:55.490
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>
<i>out of school,</i>

49:55.559 --> 49:57.159
<i>but I just got a call</i>
<i>from my agent,</i>

49:57.227 --> 49:58.460
<i>saying they were interested </i>
<i>in flying me out</i>

49:58.529 --> 50:01.363
<i>to take over on</i> psycho elite.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.331
<i>Aren't you attached to that?</i>

50:03.400 --> 50:04.899
I'm meant to be, yeah.

50:04.968 --> 50:05.934
<i>But I thought you guys</i>
<i>were already</i>

50:06.003 --> 50:07.702
<i>in principal photography?</i>

50:07.771 --> 50:09.371
They started today.

50:09.439 --> 50:11.706
<i>So what's up?</i>
<i>You're not on set?</i>

50:11.775 --> 50:13.542
I told them I couldn't be in
till tomorrow,

50:13.611 --> 50:15.143
but no one fucking listened.

50:15.212 --> 50:16.545
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

50:16.613 --> 50:18.680
<i>Hey, everything</i>
<i>all right, though? </i>

50:18.749 --> 50:20.715
Yeah, I'm grand, Jerry.
Just wanted to sort out

50:20.784 --> 50:22.717
some personal shit
before I headed out.

50:22.786 --> 50:24.853
<i>Fucking studios, bro.</i>

50:24.922 --> 50:28.090
<i>The second they panic, </i>
<i>they start recasting everybody.</i>

50:28.159 --> 50:31.259
<i>Cowards. No loyalty whatsoever.</i>

50:31.328 --> 50:33.562
What did you tell them,
if you don't mind me asking you?

50:33.631 --> 50:35.097
<i>I said</i>
<i>I wouldn't do anything</i>

50:35.166 --> 50:36.699
<i>until I spoke to my boy.</i>

50:36.768 --> 50:39.367
<i>Yo, my agent went apeshit,</i>
<i>but fuck her.</i>

50:39.436 --> 50:41.369
Cheers, man.
Really appreciate it.

50:41.438 --> 50:42.537
<i>Now, we can't be</i>
<i>going around,</i>

50:42.606 --> 50:44.105
<i>fucking each other out of jobs.</i>

50:44.174 --> 50:46.709
<i>Town's too small,</i>
<i>fucks up your Karma.</i>

50:47.578 --> 50:49.444
<i>So, all good besides that?</i>

50:49.513 --> 50:50.779
<i>Haven't seen you out in a while.</i>

50:50.848 --> 50:52.614
Yeah, all good.

50:52.683 --> 50:53.649
Just staying low for a bit,

50:53.717 --> 50:55.183
trying to get some stuff
in order.

50:55.252 --> 50:56.651
You know how it is.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.253
<i>Good for you, man.</i>

50:58.322 --> 51:00.522
<i>Can't be living ballistic</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

51:02.092 --> 51:04.459
No, we can't. But we gave it
a good lash though, didn't we?

51:04.528 --> 51:06.061
<i>Yes. We did, man.</i>

51:06.130 --> 51:10.165
<i>Rode hard and put away</i>
<i>very, very wet. You know?</i>

51:11.368 --> 51:13.635
<i>-You still with, um...</i>
-Caitlin?

51:13.704 --> 51:15.270
-I am.
<i>-The blonde. Yeah?</i>

51:15.339 --> 51:17.606
<i>That's unbelievable.</i>
<i>This one's lasted!</i>

51:17.675 --> 51:19.141
<i>It must be true love.</i>

51:19.210 --> 51:20.743
It must be.

51:20.812 --> 51:22.144
<i>Good for you, man. </i>
<i>Keep it up.</i>

51:22.213 --> 51:24.879
<i>I could use you</i>
<i>out of the picture.</i>

51:24.948 --> 51:26.514
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>you're a pussy thief.</i>

51:26.784 --> 51:27.616
<i>No one's safe.</i>

51:27.685 --> 51:30.585
Not anymore, Jerry. I am out.

51:32.055 --> 51:33.855
Honestly, though, buddy.
I appreciate you calling.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.123
I owe you one.

51:35.192 --> 51:36.491
<i>You sure fucking do, Blake.</i>

51:36.560 --> 51:37.526
<i>You ever hear anyone</i>
<i>trying to take</i>

51:37.594 --> 51:40.061
<i>a movie from up under me,</i>

51:40.130 --> 51:41.897
<i>you speed dial my ass,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

51:43.734 --> 51:45.467
You bet, I will.

51:45.536 --> 51:47.702
<i>All right. Hey, look,</i>
<i>good luck with your girl.</i>

51:47.771 --> 51:50.705
<i>Happy for you, happy for me.</i>

51:50.774 --> 51:52.340
Thanks, buddy.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.410
- Look after yourself, all right?
- -<i>All right, later.</i>

51:57.147 --> 51:58.714
<i>It's worse</i>
<i>than we fucking thought.</i>

51:59.650 --> 52:01.049
What is, Richard?

52:01.118 --> 52:02.684
<i>Fuck you, Tristan.</i>
<i>You know what I'm talking about.</i>

52:02.753 --> 52:05.521
<i>Okay, I just got off</i>
<i>the phone with James.</i>

52:05.589 --> 52:08.456
<i>He said, "they are seeking</i>
<i>a replacement as we speak."</i>

52:08.525 --> 52:09.991
- I know that.
- -<i>You know that?</i>

52:10.060 --> 52:11.493
<i>What? How the fuck</i>
<i>do you know that?</i>

52:11.562 --> 52:13.428
Because, I just do, Richard.

52:13.497 --> 52:16.665
Look. It's just one day,
for fuck's sake!

52:16.734 --> 52:19.534
I told them my dates.
I told you my dates.

52:19.603 --> 52:21.803
I told fucking everybody
my dates.

52:21.872 --> 52:23.505
<i>It's not one day, okay?</i>

52:23.574 --> 52:24.873
<i>It's the first day.</i>

52:24.942 --> 52:27.475
<i>The very first fucking day.</i>

52:27.544 --> 52:29.043
<i>If you're not there</i>
<i>on the first day,</i>

52:29.112 --> 52:30.612
<i>how are they to believe</i>
<i>you'll be there on the second?</i>

52:30.681 --> 52:32.380
Because I said I would!

52:32.449 --> 52:35.483
And, honestly,
I'm sick of this conversation.

52:35.552 --> 52:38.520
You work for me,
not the other way around.

52:38.589 --> 52:39.855
- Fix this!
- -<i>Look.</i>

52:39.924 --> 52:41.957
<i>I know you're</i>
<i>a moneymaker, man.</i>

52:42.026 --> 52:43.158
<i>But this is not how...</i>

52:43.227 --> 52:45.760
No, Richard,
this is exactly how it is.

52:45.829 --> 52:46.861
It's business.

52:46.930 --> 52:48.697
Either you do your job

52:48.766 --> 52:51.499
or I'll find some other
fucking donkey

52:51.568 --> 52:54.837
over that cunt of an agency
who can.

52:56.473 --> 52:57.640
Now, fuck off!

53:16.660 --> 53:17.693
<i>What did you say to dad?</i>

53:17.761 --> 53:20.629
What?
What are you talking about?

53:20.698 --> 53:22.131
<i>Dad.</i>
<i>What did you say to him?</i>

53:22.199 --> 53:25.800
Nothing. I asked if he wanted
to come visit. That's all.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.335
<i>Are you stupid?</i>

53:27.404 --> 53:29.904
<i>Why would you do</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

53:29.973 --> 53:32.474
Because I wanted him here,
that's why.

53:32.543 --> 53:35.644
Is it a crime to want
your father to come visit you?

53:35.713 --> 53:39.281
And he wanted to as well,
before he had a turn.

53:39.350 --> 53:41.716
I thought the medication
was working.

53:41.785 --> 53:43.251
He sounded fine to me.

53:43.320 --> 53:46.821
<i>God. How would you</i>
<i>know that, Tristan?</i>

53:46.890 --> 53:48.790
<i>You're never even here.</i>

53:48.859 --> 53:50.659
<i>Anyway. That "turn,"</i>
<i>as you call it,</i>

53:50.728 --> 53:54.430
<i>thanks to you, has resulted </i>
<i>in him going missing again.</i>

53:54.732 --> 53:56.231
What?

53:56.300 --> 53:58.000
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>You're never here.</i>

53:58.069 --> 54:01.469
<i>How could you know anything?</i>
<i>He goes missing now and again.</i>

54:01.538 --> 54:03.605
<i>Whenever he gets confused</i>
<i>and worked up.</i>

54:03.674 --> 54:05.474
Why didn't you tell me that?

54:05.543 --> 54:08.310
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>difference would that make?</i>

54:08.379 --> 54:10.945
Just tell me
what happened, siobhán.

54:11.014 --> 54:11.980
<i>He ran out.</i>

54:12.048 --> 54:13.514
<i>Just after talking to you.</i>

54:13.583 --> 54:16.352
<i>After your lovely, apparently,</i>
<i>harmless conversation.</i>

54:16.420 --> 54:19.020
<i>You just couldn't</i>
<i>leave him be, could you?</i>

54:19.089 --> 54:20.622
And did you find him?

54:20.691 --> 54:22.324
<i>No, he ran away good</i>
<i>this time.</i>

54:22.392 --> 54:24.859
<i>Susan said he went</i>
<i>absolutely bloody hysterical</i>

54:24.928 --> 54:26.427
<i>after talking to you.</i>

54:26.496 --> 54:27.896
<i>He was too strong for her</i>
<i>to stop him.</i>

54:28.999 --> 54:30.399
Who's out looking for him?

54:32.069 --> 54:35.937
Siobhán, who is out
looking for him?

54:36.006 --> 54:38.540
- <i>Everyone.</i>
- You?

54:38.609 --> 54:40.709
<i>Well, someone has to stay</i>
<i>by the phone, don't they?</i>

54:42.313 --> 54:43.158
<i>Jesus, you've gone</i>
<i>and done it again.</i>

54:43.180 --> 54:44.090
What the fuck did you just say?

54:44.115 --> 54:46.581
<i>You heard.</i>

54:46.650 --> 54:49.718
Yeah, I heard you.
I just didn't wanna believe it.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.686
<i>We all know</i>
<i>why she did it.</i>

54:51.755 --> 54:53.955
<i>Now it's happening</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

54:54.024 --> 54:56.492
- That's not fair.
- -<i>Not fair?</i>

54:57.461 --> 54:59.861
<i>Not fair? Please, Tristan.</i>

54:59.930 --> 55:03.465
<i>The partying, the drugs,</i>
<i>the women, the crash.</i>

55:03.534 --> 55:05.133
<i>You think we didn't get</i>
<i>the brunt</i>

55:05.202 --> 55:07.068
<i>of that filthy sword back home? </i>

55:07.137 --> 55:08.737
<i>Do you?</i>

55:08.806 --> 55:10.339
<i>I could just about take it.</i>

55:10.408 --> 55:12.640
<i>Even dad could, up until now.</i>
<i>But mom...</i>

55:12.709 --> 55:15.477
<i>You let her down so much.</i>

55:15.546 --> 55:18.012
<i>She was an absolute wreck.</i>
<i>Was that fair?</i>

55:18.081 --> 55:20.515
She was sick, siobhán.
She was sick!

55:20.584 --> 55:22.784
And I didn't know it.
None of us knew it!

55:22.853 --> 55:25.053
She always seemed
so fucking happy.

55:25.122 --> 55:26.955
<i>Tristan, she was miserable.</i>

55:27.024 --> 55:30.024
<i>It was you who made her sad.</i>
<i>It was you who made her sick.</i>

55:30.093 --> 55:31.492
<i>It was you</i>
<i>who bloody killed her.</i>

55:31.561 --> 55:33.762
No, a rope and a fucking tree
that killed her, siobhán!

55:33.831 --> 55:34.830
Not me!

55:36.834 --> 55:40.735
<i>You didn't even</i>
<i>turn up on time for her funeral.</i>

55:40.804 --> 55:42.404
<i>And when you did get there,</i>

55:42.472 --> 55:44.205
<i>you were out of your mind</i>
<i>on god knows what,</i>

55:44.274 --> 55:47.976
<i>and smelling like a bottle</i>
<i>and a brothel all at once.</i>

55:48.045 --> 55:49.711
<i>It was an embarrassment</i>
<i>to all of us.</i>

55:49.780 --> 55:52.614
<i>And, on top of that,</i>
<i>we had to be reminded of it</i>

55:52.683 --> 55:54.949
<i>by every blatant paper</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

55:55.018 --> 55:56.618
<i>And then, the wedding.</i>

55:57.187 --> 55:58.686
<i>That topped it all.</i>

55:58.755 --> 56:00.955
<i>Missing in fucking action</i>
<i>once again.</i>

56:01.024 --> 56:02.424
<i>The superstar arsehole.</i>

56:02.493 --> 56:04.092
Yeah, and since that day,

56:04.161 --> 56:06.094
I've been trying
to make things right.

56:06.163 --> 56:09.697
You don't think I don't know
what I was, what I did?

56:09.766 --> 56:11.533
You don't think
i don't wanna go back

56:11.602 --> 56:13.035
and fucking change everything?

56:13.103 --> 56:16.137
All the money in the world,
siobhán, won't bring her back.

56:16.206 --> 56:19.107
And all the money in the world
won't save dad.

56:19.176 --> 56:22.677
So, please, for once
in your fucking life,

56:22.746 --> 56:24.012
give me a break!

56:24.081 --> 56:26.815
Because I'm trying my best
over here! All right?

56:29.086 --> 56:30.218
<i>I have to go.</i>

56:30.287 --> 56:31.486
Siobhán!

56:31.555 --> 56:33.054
<i>I'll call you when I find him.</i>

56:33.123 --> 56:34.690
Siobhán!

56:35.692 --> 56:36.692
Fuck!

57:11.061 --> 57:13.027
Please tell me you have
some good news, my darling.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.129
I could really do with it.

57:15.198 --> 57:16.598
<i>Well, I just got off the phone</i>

57:16.667 --> 57:18.066
<i>with your adoring agent,</i>

57:18.135 --> 57:19.735
<i>and I explained carefully</i>
<i>but forcefully</i>

57:19.803 --> 57:21.970
<i>that you are attending</i>
<i>to a critical personal matter</i>

57:22.039 --> 57:24.239
<i>and he needs to relax.</i>

57:24.308 --> 57:27.041
You say that before or after you
told him to go fuck himself?

57:27.110 --> 57:28.676
<i>Ha! Between, actually.</i>

57:28.745 --> 57:31.579
<i>Seriously, that man needs</i>
<i>to untwist his panties,</i>

57:31.648 --> 57:33.715
<i>'cause he's like my aunt</i>
<i>on Adderall.</i>

57:33.784 --> 57:35.917
<i>Look, just do</i>
<i>what you have to do, okay?</i>

57:35.986 --> 57:37.719
<i>And then get your ass</i>
<i>to that airport in the morning</i>

57:37.788 --> 57:39.787
<i>or I will kill you myself.</i>

57:39.856 --> 57:41.623
You're the boss, Louise.

57:41.692 --> 57:42.991
<i>You're finally catching on.</i>

57:43.928 --> 57:46.661
Thanks, darling. I mean it.

57:46.730 --> 57:49.564
You're the only one that
actually gives a fuck about me.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.333
<i>I do.</i>

57:51.401 --> 57:53.935
<i>Lord knows it's not the money
'cause you pay me fuck all.</i>

58:08.184 --> 58:09.650
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

58:09.719 --> 58:12.153
<i>I can't come to the phone</i>
<i>right now,</i>

58:12.222 --> 58:13.654
<i>but if you leave</i>
<i>a little message,</i>

58:13.723 --> 58:15.156
<i>I will go to the ends</i>
<i>of the earth</i>

58:15.225 --> 58:16.015
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>that I call you back.</i>

58:16.026 --> 58:17.759
Hey, honey.

58:17.828 --> 58:18.961
Still en route.

58:19.029 --> 58:21.696
Um, just wanted
to call you and tell you...

58:21.765 --> 58:24.566
How much I love you and...

58:24.635 --> 58:27.135
How much I want us to be...

58:34.444 --> 58:35.349
<i>You know,</i>
<i>that publicist of yours</i>

58:35.378 --> 58:37.111
<i>is a sizzling cunt.</i>

58:37.180 --> 58:38.613
That's why I hired her, Richard.

58:38.681 --> 58:40.348
<i>Bullshit.</i>
<i>You hired her</i>

58:40.417 --> 58:42.784
<i>'cause she's fucking hot</i>
<i>and a dictatorial bitch.</i>

58:42.853 --> 58:45.019
No, I hired her
because she does her job.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.421
You could learn
a lot from her, actually.

58:46.489 --> 58:47.455
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>well, you'd better hope</i>

58:47.524 --> 58:49.157
<i>she's as good as you say,</i>

58:50.227 --> 58:51.059
<i>because the stunt</i>
<i>she's pulling at the studio</i>

58:51.127 --> 58:52.560
<i>is very dangerous.</i>

58:52.629 --> 58:55.063
- You worried, Richard?
- -<i>Yeah, Tristan.</i>

58:55.132 --> 58:56.365
<i>I am a bit worried.</i>

58:56.433 --> 58:59.667
Well then, you're just as much
of a fucking pussy

58:59.736 --> 59:00.902
as she said you are.

59:00.971 --> 59:04.005
Just lay back
and let her take care of it.

59:04.074 --> 59:06.674
<i>That's what I'm going</i>
<i>to do, pal.</i>

59:06.743 --> 59:08.610
Sounds fucking perfect to me.

59:08.679 --> 59:10.745
I'll go ahead and give her
your ten percent then, will I?

59:10.814 --> 59:12.013
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:12.082 --> 59:13.148
<i>Very fucking funny, Tristan.</i>

59:13.216 --> 59:16.018
Gotta go.
Pest is calling me again.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.620
What do you want?

59:19.689 --> 59:20.488
<i>Are you coming?</i>
<i>Are you not coming?</i>

59:20.557 --> 59:21.322
<i>What is your fucking deal, man?</i>

59:21.391 --> 59:23.958
Listen. I don't have time

59:24.027 --> 59:26.694
to explain to you
why I'm not there.

59:26.763 --> 59:29.764
I don't need to explain to you
why I'm not there.

59:29.833 --> 59:30.865
I'm none of your business,

59:30.934 --> 59:33.167
and, frankly,
you're none of mine,

59:33.236 --> 59:35.970
so stop calling me!

59:36.039 --> 59:39.307
I'll be there tomorrow morning,
like I said I would.

59:39.376 --> 59:41.743
This movie
is pay or play for me.

59:41.812 --> 59:44.912
So, I am more than happy
to walk away

59:44.981 --> 59:46.914
with a fat fucking paycheck.

59:46.983 --> 59:48.282
And let's just see then,

59:48.351 --> 59:51.819
do they still want you
on the movie once I'm gone.

59:51.888 --> 59:54.222
I'm sure my shitty career
will survive it.

59:54.291 --> 59:56.357
But yours, I'm not so sure.

59:56.426 --> 01:00:00.161
So why don't we, as you yanks
love to fucking say,

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.664
"can't we all just get along?"

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.899
<i>Fuck you, Blake.</i>

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.902
See you tomorrow, Hemingway.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.105
<i>Yeah, tomorrow.</i>

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:23.819
Dec?

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:25.253
<i>Tristan.</i>

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:26.821
Were you all looking for him?

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:27.855
<i>I was.</i>

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:29.123
Of course, you were.

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:31.893
- Did you find him?
- -<i>We did.</i>

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.162
Thank fuck. I was worried sick.

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.698
How is he feeling?
Is he all right? Where was he?

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:40.402
<i>We found him down</i>
<i>by the river, in the last field.</i>

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:43.938
<i>He must have gone</i>
<i>down there thinking there's cows</i>

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.240
<i>let out over the bridge</i>
<i>or something, you know?</i>

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.710
Jesus.
Him and those fucking cows.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:49.745
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.713
How is he feeling?
Is he all right?

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.881
Listen, man. I owe you big time.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.350
<i>I'm sorry, Tristan.</i>

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.985
<i>He's... he's gone, bud.</i>

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.387
Gone?

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.522
What are you talking about?

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.923
You just said
you brought him back.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.358
<i>Look,</i>
<i>I'm really sorry, man.</i>

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:05.460
<i>There's nothing anyone</i>
<i>could have done.</i>

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.662
<i>You know your dad.</i>

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:09.031
<i>I mean,</i>

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.732
<i>he just gets something</i>
<i>in that head of his,</i>

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:11.900
<i>and he's doing it,</i>
<i>and no one's gonna stop him.</i>

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.839
<i>Tristan?</i>

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:36.258
How'd he go, dec?
And don't you fucking lie to me.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.026
<i>Jeez, man.</i>

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.228
<i>I don't know, man.</i>
<i>I don't think you wanna know.</i>

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.132
Just tell me the truth.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.769
<i>We found him facedown,</i>

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:49.271
<i>in the dirt by the bank.</i>

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:51.305
<i>He must have slipped,</i>
<i>and then...</i>

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.874
<i>Suffocated in the mud.</i>

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:58.346
Okay.

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:02.217
<i>I'm so sorry, man.</i>
<i>Look...</i>

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:04.185
<i>I'm... I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>He was an incredible man.</i>

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.253
Don't be.

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.924
<i>You okay, buddy?</i>
<i>This must be unbearable.</i>

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:10.992
<i>-You know...</i>
-I'm fine.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.362
<i>Anything you need me</i>
<i>to do, you just say it.</i>

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.931
<i>Look, I... I'll sort out</i>
<i>the funeral arrangements,</i>

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.999
<i>the priest, coffin, mass,</i>
<i>you name it.</i>

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.067
<i>I'll get it done. Anything.</i>

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.870
No need.

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.206
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.809
All good.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.945
<i>Well, look, you have my phone,</i>

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:32.280
<i>so you just call me anytime,</i>
<i>Tristan, all right?</i>

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.382
<i>-Please call me.</i>
-I have to go, dec.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:36.818
Thanks.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.934
Fuck shit.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:59.667
<i>Tristan, my man.</i>

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:02.470
<i>It's been a long, long time.</i>

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:04.205
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I miss you, you Irish fuck.</i>

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.942
We need to meet.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.477
<i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.246
<i>Anything for my best customer.</i>

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.147
<i>The usual?</i>

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.849
Double.

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.417
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>
<i>Where you at? You at home?</i>

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.119
I'll send you my location.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.388
<i>Cool.</i>

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:21.523
<i>I'm headed out right now.</i>

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.492
<i>Hey, hey. Tristan.</i>

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:27.996
Yeah?

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:30.564
<i>It's good</i>
<i>to have you back, man.</i>

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.834
<i>Hey, darling.</i>
<i>Just went for a walk.</i>

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.436
<i>I tried to call you,</i>

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.072
<i>but you were</i>
<i>on the other line as usual.</i>

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.107
<i>Listen.</i>

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.376
<i>Something weird happened today.</i>

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:05.346
<i>Really weird,</i>
<i>and I wanted to ask you...</i>

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.788
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:16.256
<i>I can't come</i>
<i>to the phone right now.</i>

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.725
<i>But if you leave</i>
<i>a little message, I'll go to...</i>

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.368
Siobhán.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.441
<i>I just can't believe</i>
<i>he's gone.</i>

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:34.942
I know.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.345
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:40.314
- First thing tomorrow.
- -<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:41.515
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:46.353
<i>I'm so sorry about what I said</i>
<i>to you earlier.</i>

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:49.456
Listen, forget about that.
You were right.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:51.225
I haven't been there
for you guys.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.261
<i>I guess</i>
<i>we're both sorry, then.</i>

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.464
<i>They're both gone.</i>

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.533
<i>I can't believe it,</i>
<i>they're both gone.</i>

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.337
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to tell the kids.</i>

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:05.706
<i>They just adored him.</i>

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.310
They'll understand, eventually.
Look, it'll take time.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.278
But if they don't, they have you
and tom to lean on.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:13.380
<i>Tom?</i>

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:14.883
<i>Tom's gone, Tristan.</i>

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.917
Gone?

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.386
<i>Tom left me.</i>
<i>Left the kids.</i>

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:20.953
<i>Something about wanting</i>

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.557
<i>to fulfill his potential</i>
<i>or something.</i>

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.826
<i>That's why I've been struggling.</i>

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.993
<i>He took everything.</i>

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:29.264
<i>He left me</i>
<i>with literally nothing.</i>

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.265
Why didn't you tell me that?

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.602
<i>Look, you've had</i>
<i>enough to deal with.</i>

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.372
<i>And when I did try to tell you,</i>

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.207
<i>you didn't wanna have</i>
<i>anything to do with it. Or me.</i>

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.946
Jesus,
that fucking little prick.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:46.680
Where is he?

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.349
If I get
my fucking hands on him,

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.651
I'm gonna snap his little neck.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.254
<i>He's not worth it.</i>

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:56.323
<i>I was angry before, but now,</i>
<i>I'm just happy he's gone.</i>

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.691
<i>This saved me</i>
<i>a lot more heartbreak</i>

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.792
<i>down the line, I suppose.</i>

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.264
<i>Now, just get home safe. Okay?</i>

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.568
<i>I miss my little brother.</i>

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:08.803
I miss you too, siobhán.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:12.373
And, listen,
don't worry about anything.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:15.442
Don't worry about the kids.
Don't worry about the funeral.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:19.046
I'll take care of everything
the minute I'm home. I promise.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:20.815
<i>Just come home, tris.</i>

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.284
<i>Okay?</i>

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:24.685
<i>That's all I want.</i>

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.588
I'm coming home.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.224
I love you.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.026
<i>I love you.</i>

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.429
Goodbye, siobhán.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:10:59.654
<i>Who the fuck is Joseph?</i>

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:04.626
<i>Tristan.</i>

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.996
<i>Tristan. Are you there?</i>

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:10.598
I am, yeah. Sorry.

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:12.866
<i>Who the fuck</i>
<i>is this Joseph guy?</i>

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.001
<i>And why is he calling me?</i>

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.703
He's...

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.339
He's a nobody.
Listen, ignore him.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:20.374
<i>Well, I told him</i>
<i>to go fuck himself, but...</i>

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:21.742
<i>But, Tristan,</i>

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.610
<i>he knows practically everything</i>
<i>about you,</i>

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.312
<i>and I do mean everything.</i>

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.681
<i>And he's threatening</i>
<i>to take it to the press.</i>

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.617
<i>Are you listening</i>
<i>to me, Tristan?</i>

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:32.320
<i>I don't think you realize</i>
<i>the magnitude of this situation.</i>

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.055
<i>He knows everything,</i>
<i>things he shouldn't know,</i>

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.858
<i>things even I shouldn't know.</i>

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.661
He used to be my therapist.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.664
<i>He never mentioned</i>
<i>the word "therapist" to me.</i>

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:46.133
<i>Aren't they supposed to keep</i>
<i>your private life confidentia</i>

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.768
yes.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:49.537
<i>That guy must've missed</i>
<i>that day in shrink school,</i>

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:53.006
<i>because he was very explicit</i>
<i>about some very personal shit.</i>

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.775
<i>So, what the hell is going on?</i>

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.477
I don't know.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:57.578
<i>Well, you'd better</i>
<i>figure it out, tris,</i>

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:00.348
<i>because this guy is serious. </i>

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.615
<i>Does he want money?</i>
<i>Did you do something to him? </i>

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.216
<i>What's his problem?</i>

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:03.818
I have no idea.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.754
<i>God.</i>
<i>What a fucking disaster.</i>

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.156
<i>Look, I'm gonna be honest</i>
<i>with you here. </i>

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:10.023
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>this can be contained.</i>

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.158
<i>Not this much information.</i>

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.000
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.018
<i>'Cause, you sound</i>
<i>out of it, tris.</i>

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.136
<i>I hope you haven't...</i>

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:24.439
- I'm grand.
- -<i>Tristan.</i>

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:27.808
<i>God, talk to me, hon.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:29.510
<i>Please tell me</i>
<i>you're not using again.</i>

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:31.945
<i>God, Tristan.</i>
<i>I've been dreading this day.</i>

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.514
<i>Please, talk to me.</i>

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.983
<i>Tristan?</i>

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.651
<i>Okay, you're scaring</i>
<i>me now, tris.</i>

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.054
Dad died.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:45.058
<i>Jesus Christ, Tristan,</i>
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.428
<i>You should have said</i>
<i>something, hon. I'm just...</i>

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:50.464
<i>Rambling on like</i>
<i>a fucking asshole.</i>

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.566
<i>Is there anything you need me</i>
<i>to do? Anything at all.</i>

01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:54.568
I'm flying home first thing
in the morning.

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:56.870
So, if you can look after
the movie for me, it'd be great.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.673
<i>Fuck the film,</i>
<i>okay? It's just a job.</i>

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.442
<i>Fuck those people.</i>

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.543
<i>Look, is there anything else</i>
<i>I can do, sweetheart?</i>

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:05.813
<i>Just tell me, you poor thing.</i>

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.348
<i>Hon, you already have</i>
<i>so much to deal with,</i>

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.883
<i>without this coming down</i>
<i>on you now.</i>

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.785
Louise, are you okay?

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.822
<i>It's just...</i>
<i>It's just shitty, you know?</i>

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.891
<i>You never get a break.</i>

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.092
<i>Every time you try</i>
<i>to do your best,</i>

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.861
<i>you try to change things,</i>

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.396
<i>something fucking comes up,</i>
<i>you're mom and now you're dad.</i>

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:25.199
<i>It's just...</i>
<i>It's just shitty is all.</i>

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:27.901
Louise, it's life.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.637
I'm just gonna have
to deal with it.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.742
<i>Hon, you're a strong guy.</i>

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:37.878
<i>You are strong.</i>

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.913
<i>You just go</i>
<i>and you mourn your father.</i>

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.182
<i>And I will take care</i>
<i>of everything else.</i>

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.251
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.054
<i>I'm not</i>
<i>just your publicist, Tristan.</i>

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.123
<i>I'm your family, right?</i>
<i>You never forget that.</i>

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:50.958
<i>And, Tristan...</i>

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:53.360
Yes?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.995
<i>Please, promise me </i>
<i>you'll be careful.</i>

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.563
<i>You've come...</i>

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:57.642
<i>Way too far</i>
<i>to let this send you back</i>

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:58.733
<i>to where you were before.</i>

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:01.803
I won't.

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:04.839
<i>I love you, kid.</i>

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:31.532
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:33.066
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.736
It's Tristan, Joseph.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.272
<i>Tristan? </i>
<i>I don't, I don't know a Tristan.</i>

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:40.541
Listen, stop fucking with me.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.075
What is this about you calling

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.244
and threatening my publicist,
threatening me?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.179
<i>Tristan.</i>

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:47.914
<i>Now I have it.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, you're...</i>

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.023
<i>Your father's disease</i>
<i>set in there for a second.</i>

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.219
<i>How is he doing, by the way?</i>

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.123
Joseph,
are you fucking listening to me?

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:59.226
<i>I am listening</i>
<i>to every word you say.</i>

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:01.628
Why did you go to Louise?

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.597
And why did you start
spieling off

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.099
a load of shit
about going to the press?

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.602
<i>To protect us.</i>

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.337
"Protect us"?
Protect us from what?

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:12.006
<i>From you, Tristan.</i>

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:15.742
<i>To protect us from you.</i>

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:16.943
What are you talking about?

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.613
There is no us.
There never has been an us.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.915
You fucking lunatic!

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.084
<i>You actors.</i>

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.186
<i>You're all the same.</i>

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:29.122
<i>It's always you, you, you.</i>
<i>Someone helps you succeed.</i>

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.159
<i>As soon as you arrive,</i>
<i>it's like they never existed.</i>

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:35.195
<i>No matter how many necks</i>
<i>you step on, on your way up,</i>

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.998
<i>you still insist you did it all</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:41.134
<i>An insecure bunch</i>
<i>of spoiled fucking brats,</i>

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.603
<i>the entire lot of you.</i>

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:45.672
<i>It's not even a job.</i>

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:48.175
<i>It's the people who save lives</i>

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:49.577
<i>that should be getting</i>
<i>that kind of money.</i>

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.045
<i>People who make</i>
<i>personal sacrifices,</i>

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.580
<i>in the shadows,</i>

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.482
<i>so that people like you</i>
<i>can walk in the sun.</i>

01:15:55.551 --> 01:16:00.253
<i>Ungrateful, selfish, grasping</i>
<i>assholes like you, Tristan.</i>

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:03.023
You don't threaten me.

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.658
I threaten you.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.394
If you even think
of releasing anything...

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:10.230
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>You're right, Tristan.</i>

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:13.900
<i>Your therapist is not supposed</i>
<i>to threaten you.</i>

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.970
<i>Your therapist is supposed</i>
<i>to keep your secrets.</i>

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.739
<i>That is very true.</i>

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:21.675
<i>I know you think that you are</i>
<i>the center of the universe,</i>

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.010
<i>but the truth is,</i>

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.278
<i>I have a little secret</i>
<i>of my own.</i>

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:28.149
- "A secret"?
- -<i>A secret.</i>

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:34.121
Well, what the fuck is it, then?

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.057
<i>Well, I can't tell you.</i>
<i>As I said, it's a secret.</i>

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:39.226
<i>Tristan, I want you to guess</i>
<i>my secret, I bet you can't.</i>

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:40.694
Listen to me.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:43.764
I will come down on top of you
with everything I've got.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.832
You won't work
a single fucking day

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.901
in this town or any other town,

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.436
as long as I fucking live.

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:52.739
You will be working
for fucking pennies,

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:56.276
flipping burgers back
in the shithole you came from.

01:16:56.345 --> 01:17:00.747
You unethical dozy prick!
You hear me?

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.283
How's that for a secret?

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:07.321
<i>Here is the thing about</i>
<i>the patient-doctor relationsh</i>

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.024
<i>it's sacrosanct, it really is.</i>

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:15.062
<i>But it also only goes one way.</i>

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.998
<i>You talk, I listen.</i>
<i>You complain, I soothe.</i>

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.200
<i>You tell me all your secrets,</i>
<i>every dark moment,</i>

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:22.969
<i>every destructive mistake,</i>
<i>every terrible frailty,</i>

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:24.905
<i>and I take it all in.</i>

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.840
<i>Everything flows one way,</i>

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:28.342
<i>patient to therapist.</i>

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.277
<i>And do you know</i>
<i>what that means, Tristan?</i>

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:33.180
Yeah. It means
you're a fucking wanker.

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:34.815
<i>It means</i>

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:37.150
<i>that the therapist</i>
<i>has all the information,</i>

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:40.087
<i>all the control,</i>
<i>and all the power.</i>

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.389
What are you fucking at, Joseph?

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:44.991
None of these threats
mean anything.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.394
Anything I've said to you
is covered

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:50.297
in patient-doctor
confidentiality.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:54.134
Do you even know what that is,
you silly fucking twat?

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:56.737
<i>It's an interesting </i>
<i>word, "confidentiality."</i>

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:58.405
You kidding me?

01:17:58.474 --> 01:18:00.941
Me, client.
You, licensed therapist.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.844
Anything we've discussed
in treatment is privileged.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:06.180
<i>Yeah. See,</i>
<i>there in lies the secret.</i>

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:08.548
I don't understand, Joseph.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.817
<i>Of course, you don't.</i>
<i>How could you?</i>

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.153
<i>Because I've been</i>
<i>protecting you.</i>

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.888
<i>I've actually been</i>
<i>protecting us both.</i>

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:16.423
<i>But now...</i>

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:18.792
<i>I find that things have changed.</i>

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.127
Who is us?

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.796
There is no us.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.898
You're out
of your fucking mind, man.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.767
<i>There has always been us,</i>

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.169
<i>even if you don't know it.</i>

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.472
<i>You've taken everything from me,</i>

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.909
<i>and because of this,</i>
<i>we are inextricably linked.</i>

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:38.278
I've taken nothing from you.

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.046
<i>Now, I'm not mad though.</i>

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:42.082
<i>Not now.</i>

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.417
<i>Because I'm gonna take it</i>
<i>all back.</i>

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:47.254
<i>I'm gonna take back everything</i>
<i>that was once mine.</i>

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:50.391
This is why I had
to stop seeing you.

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.193
You're fucking losing it, man.

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:54.495
<i>I know.</i>

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.498
<i>What you're gonna</i>
<i>do today, Tristan?</i>

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:01.268
<i>Or, at least, I know</i>
<i>what you think you're gonna do.</i>

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.270
<i>And I know that you think
you'll be happy.</i>

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.005
<i>But you're delusional.</i>

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.774
<i>A man like you isn't even
capable of happiness.</i>

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:09.343
<i>A man like you is only good
at destroying things.</i>

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:13.013
<i>Well, I won't let you
destroy her life</i>

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.916
<i>any more than you already have.</i>

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:17.418
<i>So, you might as well
turn around now,</i>

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.219
<i>because the answer
to your question</i>

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.521
<i>is going to be no.</i>

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:27.828
Fuck off, Joseph, you psychopathic cunt.

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:35.989
<i>Tristan?</i>

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:38.525
<i>See, you didn't let me finish.</i>

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:40.928
<i>You see...</i>

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.163
<i>The boy I told you about...</i>

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:46.567
<i>The addict who lost the girl,
the love of his life?</i>

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:49.937
<i>When he lost the girl,</i>

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.140
<i>the most incredible girl
he'd ever known,</i>

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:55.742
<i>a girl with...</i>

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:57.644
<i>Heart, a girl who cared
about the world,</i>

01:21:57.713 --> 01:21:59.179
<i>and everyone in it.</i>

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:02.616
<i>It broke him into pieces.</i>

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.054
<i>But he was determined
to get her back.</i>

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:11.624
<i>To show her that he wasn't 
just an addict</i>

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.494
<i>and a loser, a throwaway person,</i>

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.063
<i>human trash.</i>

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.066
<i>So, he got clean...</i>

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.435
<i>And he got strong.</i>

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.237
<i>And he tracked her down
to Los Angeles,</i>

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:28.141
<i>where she had taken up
with some asshole of an actor,</i>

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:29.743
<i>another addict, even more </i>

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:32.412
<i>of a self-hating loser
than Luke was.</i>

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:36.383
<i>But the girl was blind to what
a waste of space this guy was,</i>

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:39.552
<i>so Luke concocted a plan
to protect her.</i>

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:43.256
<i>He would learn everything
he could about this actor,</i>

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:47.560
<i>find a way to enter his life,
and destroy him utterly.</i>

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.129
<i>So she could be free of him.</i>

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:52.332
<i>But even that didn't work. </i>

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:54.201
<i>All of that effort for nothing.</i>

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.203
<i>So he realized...</i>

01:22:57.773 --> 01:22:59.373
<i>That he just had to take...</i>

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.476
<i>Take what belonged to him.</i>

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.677
<i>And then...</i>

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:05.545
<i>Take again.</i>

01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:13.354
<i>Hello, Tristan.</i>

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:13.580
<i>Tristan?</i>

01:29:14.216 --> 01:29:15.482
<i>Tristan, honey.</i>

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:17.817
<i>Is that you?</i>
