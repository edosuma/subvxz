Seems like every morning

when you wake up,

00:03.712 --> 00:05.923
it's like you're being born

You can't see, you can't talk.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.470
"How do I walk?"

the snooze alarm.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.020
The snooze alarm

00:18.226 --> 00:20.020
is based on the idea

00:20.020 --> 00:23.148
that when the alarm goes off,

00:20.020 --> 00:23.148
you are not getting up.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.818
You're not even awake,

00:23.148 --> 00:25.818
you're already a failure.

You gave Mema's napkins

21:04.222 --> 21:07.307
to some dogs?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.684
What happened to my jacket?

21:08.684 --> 21:11.145
The dogs did that,

21:08.684 --> 21:11.145
but it wasn't their fault.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.606
Somebody stuffed some

21:11.145 --> 21:13.606
strange meat in the pockets.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.941
Was it mutton?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.026
Could have been.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.195
You always stuff meat

21:17.026 --> 21:19.195
in your pockets?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.780
Uh...

21:20.780 --> 21:22.406
sometimes I use the sofa.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.996
You wanted to see me,

21:27.036 --> 21:28.996
Mr. Steinbrenner?

21:28.996 --> 21:31.874
Yes, George, please, come in.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.874
Thanks for the card.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.584
I loved it.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.584
It made me feel good.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.962
Word has it you were the brains

21:33.584 --> 21:35.962
behind the whole thing.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.881
Not just me.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.881
The whole organization.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.925
Especially Mr. Morgan.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.925
Morgan. Morgan.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.219
His name is conspicuously absent

21:40.925 --> 21:43.219
from this card.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.596
Almost like he went

21:43.219 --> 21:45.596
out of his way not to sign it.

21:45.596 --> 21:46.931
No, Morgan is a good man, sir.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.266
Stop kowtowing to Morgan.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.184
Congratulations.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.184
You've got his job.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.852
Well, thank you, sir.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.687
I'm not quite sure

21:51.852 --> 21:53.687
I'm right for it.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.189
It's done, George.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.189
He's out, you're in.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.816
A lot more work, you know.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.816
I know.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.609
A lot more responsibility.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.609
I know.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.360
Long, long hours.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.360
I know.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.821
Not much more money.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.740
But you'll finally get

22:01.821 --> 22:04.740
the recognition you deserve.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.700
That's what I'm afraid of.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.161
Mr. Steinbrenner, if I--

22:08.161 --> 22:10.163
Painful as it is,

22:08.161 --> 22:10.163
I've had to let a few people go

22:10.163 --> 22:11.872
over the years.

22:11.872 --> 22:17.170
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella,

22:11.872 --> 22:17.170
Bucky Dent, Billy Martin,

22:17.170 --> 22:22.258
Dallas Green, Dick Hauser,

22:17.170 --> 22:22.258
Bill Virdon, Billy Martin,

22:22.258 --> 22:26.971
Stump Merrill, Billy Martin,

22:22.258 --> 22:26.971
Bob Lemon, Billy Martin,

22:26.971 --> 22:30.224
Gene Michael, Buck Showalter--

22:26.971 --> 22:30.224
Uh, George!

22:30.224 --> 22:31.767
You didn't hear that from me.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.269
George?
