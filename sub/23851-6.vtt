<i>This is one of my favorite spaces</i>
<i>in the White House.</i>

00:08.200 --> 00:10.238
<i>We call it the Colonnade.</i>

00:10.240 --> 00:12.838
<i>I've filled it with beautiful art</i>
<i>that holds special meaning</i>

00:12.840 --> 00:14.320
<i>to my husband and me.</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:19.480
<i>This is where I first met the President.</i>

00:20.800 --> 00:24.718
<i>And this is a bust of</i>
<i>Ms. Heather Chandler of Sherwood, Ohio.</i>

00:24.720 --> 00:28.560
<i>It reminds me of the first time</i>
<i>I watched my husband attempt a murder.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:31.558
<i>And this is Butcher's Bridge.</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:33.758
<i>The very spot where I knew</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

00:33.760 --> 00:36.120
<i>that I truly loved the President.</i>

00:44.280 --> 00:46.998
<i>It's also the very spot</i>
<i>where the President betrayed me,</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:48.560
<i>and then lied about it.</i>

00:52.680 --> 00:55.238
<i>As a role model,</i>
<i>I have a duty to set an example</i>

00:55.240 --> 00:58.878
<i>to women all across our great nation,</i>

00:58.880 --> 01:02.920
<i>so they know that lies and betrayal</i>
<i>of any kind are unacceptable.</i>

<i>Dear Diary, so the doctors told me</i>
<i>they can only keep JD against his will</i>

02:02.240 --> 02:04.718
<i>in what's called a mental hold</i>
<i>for three days</i>

02:04.720 --> 02:06.758
<i>and it had to be for a good reason.</i>

02:06.760 --> 02:09.118
He blew up his car. A Porsche.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.120
Damn, he's the craziest one in here.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.398
<i>So, I guess JD has three days</i>
<i>to make up for what he did.</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:21.000
<i>Three days to learn how to be</i>
<i>a proper boyfriend.</i>

02:33.240 --> 02:35.040
Good morning, Sunshine.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.358
<i>And we're doing...</i>

02:50.360 --> 02:53.078
a one, two, three. Noose.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.718
One, two, three.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.878
Razor blade.
One, two, three.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.918
Drink poison and... splits.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.880
And bang. Shoot yourself.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.878
Epic. Heather, play your cards right and
you could end up in my shoes one day.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.038
Excuse me.
I won't do splits.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.198
All great dance numbers
end with splits, Heather.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.558
I just don't think Sue E. Cyde
would do them.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.598
-It feels unmotivated.
-She's about to kill herself, Heather.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.438
Of course, splits are motivated.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.520
Or is it because our actress
can't do them?

03:22.880 --> 03:25.718
Heather.
Do you know who's coming to our preview?

03:25.720 --> 03:29.158
Amita. Amita and her massive
social media footprint.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.758
I know who Amita is, Heather.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.798
Then you know that one post
to her 600,000 followers

03:33.800 --> 03:36.598
takes me and my campaign
to end suicide to the next level.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.478
And you know that with Amita coming,

03:38.480 --> 03:41.438
we have all the more reason
for our lead to do splits.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.838
Maybe we need a new choreographer.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.240
Someone who gets art.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.598
Or maybe we need a new actress.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.320
Bang.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.678
Heather, using a gun in school
is a very serious issue.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.278
-Who is Heather?
-Me.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.838
I don't understand.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.838
We need to expel her.
Is that your preferred pronoun?

04:02.840 --> 04:06.158
For old people, my preferred pronoun
is don't talk to me.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.518
Why is his name Heather?
Why would his parents name him Heather?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.718
I thought
we were supposed to say "they."

04:11.720 --> 04:13.878
You know, I find "they" to be
very confusing.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.438
Whatever it is,
we need to expel them.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.077
-Them? There are two now?
-No, we're talking about her.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.517
-You just said "them."
-Well, we mean him.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.438
-Don't call him "him."
-Can you believe her?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.078
I thought we weren't supposed
to say "her"?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.718
-I meant her, not them.
-Well, who is "them" then?

04:27.720 --> 04:30.198
For crying out loud,
what is going on here?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.958
We expelled Lizzy for bringing
a gun to school, Maurice.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.558
Okay, Lizzy was poor.
We didn't know what she was capable of.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.078
Let's be honest.
Them's not hurting anyone.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.480
Heather does have the face of an angel.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.078
I guess you're right.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.038
I've never heard of a redhead
committing a crime.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.198
But we need to send a message.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.278
And I have just the punishment for zim.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.998
Who is Zim?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.560
What the hell did he do?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.598
What is this?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.438
Westerburg Considered.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.440
Westerburg's balanced
and thoughtful news program.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.438
You've never seen it? Our show airs
every morning during first period.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.358
Obviously, I've never been here
that early.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.278
Heather, I want you

05:16.280 --> 05:20.318
to bring your formidable
entertainment skills to the table,

05:20.320 --> 05:24.760
and help these young men
turn Westerburg Considered into a hit.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.918
Or get expelled

05:28.920 --> 05:32.600
and run the risk of having
to come back here another year.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.878
Why does it smell like SPF-1000?

05:42.880 --> 05:44.360
Oh, hello, Heather.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.598
They're making me do journalism,
Heather.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.958
Like the boring kind for ugly people.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.478
Maybe you could talk to them.
Say it wasn't a big deal.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.678
But it was a big deal, Heather.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.318
You threatened me.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.998
I don't know how long it's gonna take
for me to feel safe again at Westerburg.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.158
Can you not be a total teratoma
for once and just help me?

06:05.160 --> 06:07.318
Actually, I don't think I can.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.758
I would for a real friend, but...

06:09.760 --> 06:12.518
you tried to make a play for my throne
before my body was even cold.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.678
You were dead.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.040
You left me.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.918
You know, I always knew
you'd come crawling back

06:19.920 --> 06:22.358
like the seasonal
Halloween store employee you are.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.558
-Okay.
-Your ambition again

06:24.560 --> 06:26.398
outstrips your skills, Heather.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.598
Proximity to power is really the most
someone like you can ever ask for.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.758
And if I have to take that away
so you learn your lesson,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.480
then so be it.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.120
Father, I need your advice.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.598
I know you always taught me
to be number one.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.518
And, of course,
in most areas of my life, I am.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.398
I'm the richest. I'm the hottest.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.840
I have the alabaster skin
of a cursed prince.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.638
But at school, I'm still second fiddle

07:05.640 --> 07:07.000
because of her.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.360
Heather.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.158
Obviously, I know the real reason
she won't let me rise up

07:13.160 --> 07:16.878
to my rightful place is because
she's deeply jealous of me.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.118
Just like Mom, I guess.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.758
Witch.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.878
You'd think I would be happy
she fell down the staircase

07:22.880 --> 07:25.758
just like your first wife did.
And... I am.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.278
It's almost as if I psychologically

07:28.280 --> 07:29.918
only feel comfortable when a strong,

07:29.920 --> 07:34.200
overbearing woman with questionably
garish style lords over my every whim.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.720
So, I ask you...

07:40.640 --> 07:42.000
Dad...

07:43.400 --> 07:45.480
What should I do about Heather Chandler?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.040
What's that, Dad?

07:53.520 --> 07:56.318
Systematically destroy her
and everything she holds dear

07:56.320 --> 07:59.320
by any means necessary,
just like you did with Mom?

08:02.200 --> 08:04.000
Thank you, Dad.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.478
<i>Dear Diary, in order to move forward</i>
<i>as a couple,</i>

08:08.480 --> 08:11.038
<i>JD has a lot more to learn.</i>

08:11.040 --> 08:12.880
<i>Like how to communicate.</i>

08:18.200 --> 08:20.160
Are you sure you want me
to read your diary?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.518
No, I mean,

08:23.520 --> 08:25.598
you should read it.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
They're your words.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.957
"I know I made a mistake, Veronica.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.438
And I know I can never actually
make it up to you."

08:36.440 --> 08:38.758
But that's why I'm here, JD.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.520
I'm telling you
that you can at least try.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.880
"But I don't deserve you, Veronica.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.718
I cheated on you.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.958
You were hopelessly devoted
and I threw all of that away

08:55.960 --> 08:59.638
on just one stupid kiss
with Betty Finn."

08:59.640 --> 09:00.960
That's true.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.680
But I'm a forgiving person.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.518
So good of you, Veronica.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.920
And, hey...

09:12.960 --> 09:16.200
I'll get there.
I will. It's just...

09:17.440 --> 09:19.840
Your crime was so big,

09:21.400 --> 09:22.920
so hurtful,

09:23.960 --> 09:27.478
that I couldn't let you
go to jail for attacking Betty.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.640
The punishment just wouldn't
fit the crime.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.080
For you to truly atone...

09:36.760 --> 09:38.080
you need me.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.480
As judge, jury...

09:43.640 --> 09:45.480
and executioner.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.280
I'm a good kid.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.198
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.718
I'm a good person.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.558
-You're not.
-I am!

09:55.560 --> 09:57.478
-You're not, you're not, you're not!
-Shut up.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.800
-You're not, you're not, you're not.
-Shut up!

10:24.080 --> 10:25.598
Nurse, help!

10:25.600 --> 10:27.638
She's-- She's trying to kill me.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.278
She did this to me, okay?
She put me here.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.238
She wants me in one place

10:32.240 --> 10:34.318
so she can murder me.
Please help me.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.198
The new ones always do this.
He'll calm down in a few hours.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.318
She's evil! God!

10:40.320 --> 10:43.798
She's going to kill me!
God, you have to help me! Please.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.438
No, no!

10:45.440 --> 10:48.560
Somebody help me!
No. Stop!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.958
You calm down.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.118
This little blonde girl here
is not going to kill anyone.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.678
He'll get better.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.040
Just takes some time.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.558
And the blue bins are for glass
and cans as well, or just cans?

11:17.560 --> 11:20.758
You can actually put both
in the blue bins, Seth.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.118
Fascinating, Driffany. And that's
because non-carbon based plastic--

11:24.120 --> 11:26.400
Westerburg Considered.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.278
No one is watching
your little news show.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.478
Recycling, blah, blah.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.438
SAT prep, blah, blah.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.438
Suicide prevention,
blah, freaking, blah.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.678
Where are my high-speed chases?

11:46.680 --> 11:49.758
Where are my dead white girls?
I mean, none of your news anchors

11:49.760 --> 11:52.318
are even yelling at the viewers
with seething hatred?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.638
Well, the intended purpose
of Westerburg Considered

11:54.640 --> 11:56.158
is to inform the student body.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.798
Inform?
I'm already dead from boredom.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.078
I'm floating above myself.
I'm looking down on my body.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.598
My jawline looks great.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.958
The purpose of the media

12:05.960 --> 12:08.240
isn't to inform, Peter.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.920
It's to destroy.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.438
-But shouldn't we--
-Kyle.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.840
Heather Duke is talking.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.718
So here is more of the vibe
we'll be going for.

12:25.720 --> 12:30.038
<i>And we're supposed to believe</i>
<i>you simply ran away for two years?</i>

12:30.040 --> 12:32.558
<i>That you weren't abducted</i>
<i>by a wayward trucker?</i>

12:32.560 --> 12:34.038
<i>That you weren't held against your will</i>

12:34.040 --> 12:37.798
<i>and made to perform indecent sex acts</i>
<i>in a taxidermy shed?</i>

12:37.800 --> 12:41.278
<i>That you weren't tossed,</i>
<i>gasping for life,</i>

12:41.280 --> 12:44.758
<i>off the balcony of a cruise ship</i>
<i>by an illegal immigrant?</i>

12:44.760 --> 12:47.400
<i>I honestly was just in Portland.</i>

12:49.840 --> 12:52.438
<i>Well, it's Stockholm syndrome,</i>
<i>baby girl.</i>

12:52.440 --> 12:55.278
<i>Help me, help me, help me,</i>
<i>dear viewers,</i>

12:55.280 --> 12:58.318
<i>help this girl find the sick, twisted,</i>

12:58.320 --> 13:01.198
<i>and demented individual</i>
<i>who did this to her.</i>

13:01.200 --> 13:04.278
<i>And you're in my prayers</i>
<i>and in my unborn's prayers.</i>

13:04.280 --> 13:09.558
<i>Next up, a wealthy suburb in Ohio</i>
<i>is rocked by suicide.</i>

13:09.560 --> 13:13.478
<i>Could this be related to the murder</i>
<i>of a little girl years ago?</i>

13:13.480 --> 13:16.120
<i>We'll find out,</i>
<i>next time on Lexi Anne.</i>

13:19.760 --> 13:21.440
That is news.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.358
Now, everyone knows the best way
to ratings gold

13:25.360 --> 13:27.278
is to think of a bundt-cake-looking cow

13:27.280 --> 13:29.558
named Heather Chandler
who's wronged you

13:29.560 --> 13:32.440
and use your platform
to bring that heifer down.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.158
<i>Westerburg, our days are numbered.</i>

13:37.160 --> 13:38.958
<i>We're killing ourselves left and right.</i>

13:38.960 --> 13:41.518
<i>The ocean is filled with</i>
<i>flaming polar bear carcasses</i>

13:41.520 --> 13:43.640
<i>and none of you will ever have jobs.</i>

13:44.600 --> 13:47.878
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Welcome to Hellscape with Heather Duke.</i>

13:47.880 --> 13:50.480
<i>Now let's get to some Hot Takes</i>
<i>before we die.</i>

13:51.840 --> 13:54.278
<i>Hot take,</i>
<i>human fish bone spinning around</i>

13:54.280 --> 13:56.320
<i>a garbage disposal Betty Finn...</i>

13:58.320 --> 13:59.998
<i>was sent to military school.</i>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.998
<i>Why does she hate our troops?</i>

14:02.000 --> 14:04.158
<i>Not sure. Why don't you ask her?</i>

14:04.160 --> 14:05.798
<i>Next Hot Take,</i>

14:05.800 --> 14:08.038
<i>global warming is a problem</i>

14:08.040 --> 14:12.238
<i>and yet Trailer Parker is spending</i>
<i>how much energy rolling around</i>

14:12.240 --> 14:14.758
<i>in her space wheelchair?</i>
<i>Not sure.</i>

14:14.760 --> 14:18.118
<i>Next time you see her, ask her</i>
<i>why she hates the rainforest.</i>

14:18.120 --> 14:20.000
<i>Spoiler, it's because she's poor.</i>

14:21.520 --> 14:25.078
<i>Blind Item: guess which one</i>
<i>of Ohio's biggest influencers</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:27.878
<i>is coming to judge Heather C.</i>
<i>in her musical?</i>

14:27.880 --> 14:29.640
<i>Amita, Amita, Amita.</i>

14:30.640 --> 14:32.998
<i>Number one, she was the first person</i>
<i>to vacation to Iceland.</i>

14:33.000 --> 14:35.038
<i>Number two, she's never been in a car.</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:37.398
<i>Number three,</i>
<i>her favorite color is clear.</i>

14:37.400 --> 14:40.198
<i>Will she hate Heather's performance,</i>
<i>thus destroying her at Westerburg?</i>

14:40.200 --> 14:42.398
<i>I'll never tell.</i>

14:42.400 --> 14:46.560
<i>Now it's time for Westerburg Exposed.</i>

14:47.880 --> 14:49.758
Kyle, is it?

14:49.760 --> 14:52.600
Tell me, who do you want to expose?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.680
Peter Dawson.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.518
<i>I'm listening.</i>

14:57.520 --> 15:00.238
He masturbates in the library.
Every afternoon.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.840
Right in Biography.
Sometimes in Life Sciences.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.520
<i>Sounds like a case of</i>
<i>the gooey decimal system to me.</i>

15:12.200 --> 15:15.118
<i>Well, that's all the time we have</i>
<i>for today.</i>

15:15.120 --> 15:17.998
<i>Join us tomorrow.</i>
<i>Or don't if you're dead.</i>

15:18.000 --> 15:19.758
<i>As we say here on Hellscape:</i>

15:19.760 --> 15:21.480
<i>Everyone is wrong but you.</i>

16:30.400 --> 16:33.318
<i>Dear Diary, I believe in JD.</i>

16:33.320 --> 16:35.198
<i>I believe he can change.</i>

16:35.200 --> 16:39.638
<i>I believe he can be the boyfriend</i>
<i>I know he's capable of being.</i>

16:39.640 --> 16:41.598
<i>All he needs is some guidance.</i>

16:41.600 --> 16:44.278
<i>Some instruction.</i>

16:44.280 --> 16:48.320
<i>And I am happy to provide that for him.</i>

16:51.000 --> 16:52.878
<i>My precious Veronica,</i>

16:52.880 --> 16:55.078
<i>I am so incredibly sorry</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:57.518
<i>I didn't go with you</i>
<i>to Heather McNamara's funeral.</i>

16:57.520 --> 17:00.118
<i>I owed it to you to be there</i>
<i>to support you.</i>

17:00.120 --> 17:02.238
<i>I messed up. I was wrong.</i>

17:02.240 --> 17:04.400
<i>And it will never happen again.</i>

17:27.839 --> 17:29.880
I'll be there in a minute, lemmings.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.278
<i>Ever since I was small</i>

17:34.280 --> 17:36.238
<i>Always followed the herd</i>

17:36.240 --> 17:38.558
<i>No matter where it leads</i>

17:38.560 --> 17:44.800
<i>I was willing to be lured</i>

17:46.960 --> 17:49.078
<i>Mother always said</i>

17:49.080 --> 17:51.198
<i>Do as you're told</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:52.678
<i>Better get in line</i>

17:52.680 --> 17:57.558
<i>Or be left in the cold</i>

17:57.560 --> 18:01.758
<i>What about my books</i>
<i>What about my dreams</i>

18:01.760 --> 18:04.678
<i>What about the boy I love</i>
<i>Who's much more than he seems</i>

18:04.680 --> 18:07.078
<i>What if we ran away</i>

18:07.080 --> 18:09.238
<i>To a Parisian café</i>

18:09.240 --> 18:11.318
<i>There sipping tea</i>

18:11.320 --> 18:14.478
<i>Just him and me</i>

18:14.480 --> 18:16.798
<i>They'd say, oh, Charlotte</i>

18:16.800 --> 18:19.318
<i>There you go again</i>

18:19.320 --> 18:22.758
<i>With your flights of fancy</i>

18:22.760 --> 18:24.798
<i>No, Charlotte</i>

18:24.800 --> 18:26.998
<i>You must join us all</i>

18:27.000 --> 18:31.718
<i>Your dreams</i>
<i>They don't matter</i>

18:31.720 --> 18:35.960
<i>So, let's go splatter</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:40.758
<i>Should I play it safe</i>
<i>And stay here on my own</i>

18:40.760 --> 18:45.318
<i>It doesn't matter if you're right</i>
<i>If you're right and all alone</i>

18:45.320 --> 18:47.358
<i>So, I must leap</i>

18:47.360 --> 18:49.998
<i>But am I a sheep?</i>

18:50.000 --> 18:54.758
<i>No, I'm a lemming</i>

18:54.760 --> 18:59.238
<i>Lemmings have to leap</i>

18:59.240 --> 19:02.720
<i>Lemmings have to die</i>

19:03.680 --> 19:07.998
<i>Time to kiss the sky</i>

19:08.000 --> 19:12.078
<i>Goodbye</i>

19:12.080 --> 19:18.718
<i>Goodbye</i>

19:18.720 --> 19:20.120
<i>Goodbye.</i>

19:39.400 --> 19:43.678
Lemmings. Lemmings, come on.
Hey, come on. Go.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.080
Oh, my God. You'll never make it.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.880
Amita, honey.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.320
-Amita!
-Amita.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.880
-So, what did you think?
-It was intense.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.798
-You really think so?
-I've never seen anything like it.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.600
-We died.
-We're dead.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.958
That last song. Wow.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.438
Just wow.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.920
Was that when she came out
and screamed for three minutes?

20:13.240 --> 20:15.998
I feel like there was
a lot of moisture in the room.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.758
It's a very physical performance.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.718
Yeah, it looked like you were
trying really hard.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.640
It's amazing how breathlessly proud
of your body you were/are.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.878
Well, I think it's really important
to set a precedent

20:27.880 --> 20:29.880
for body positivity at all times.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.438
I love how I look.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.920
Well, good luck with that.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.120
You love how you look?

20:44.360 --> 20:47.558
It's funny, at Westerburg,
people think you are a queen.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.238
They fear you, they love you,

20:50.240 --> 20:51.720
they want to be you.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.078
But I know the truth.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.400
And I know that it's all an act.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.358
You're a lie, Heather.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.720
You're a joke.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.760
You're a housewife singing karaoke
on a Girls' Night.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.238
Strip away all the bells
and whistles...

21:10.240 --> 21:11.680
what's left?

21:12.680 --> 21:14.480
Just a fat girl with money.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.878
Sorry.
You love your body.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.200
You accept yourself.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.480
So, prove it.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.080
Heather?

23:05.920 --> 23:10.238
I'm so sorry, I don't want to bug you,
but I just had to say.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.118
That was wonderful.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.238
I mean, you were wonderful.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.880
I know my opinion probably
doesn't mean anything, but...

23:19.040 --> 23:21.880
That last song,
I just related to it so much.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.680
I just know you're going to be
on Broadway one day.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.920
Grow up, Trailer Parker.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.398
<i>Blind item: what boisterous bitch's</i>
<i>Broadway bid went bust?</i>

23:51.400 --> 23:53.640
<i>Spoiler alert, it's Heather Chandler.</i>

23:54.840 --> 23:57.798
Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It
<i>was dragged to hell and back</i>

23:57.800 --> 23:59.518
<i>by everyone who matters.</i>

23:59.520 --> 24:02.880
<i>Let's pour some gasoline on</i>
<i>this dumpster fire, shall we?</i>

24:09.360 --> 24:11.038
This one's my favorite.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.998
<i>Her star is falling faster</i>
<i>than a stack of bricks.</i>

24:14.000 --> 24:17.518
<i>But wait. There's more?</i>

24:17.520 --> 24:20.198
<i>Time for Hot Takes. My Hot Take?</i>

24:20.200 --> 24:22.118
<i>Heather's show wasn't just bad,</i>

24:22.120 --> 24:25.798
<i>it was E-V-I-L evil.</i>

24:25.800 --> 24:30.438
<i>This eagle-eyed reporter spotted</i>
<i>some occult imagery in some of the sets.</i>

24:30.440 --> 24:32.880
<i>Art or witchcraft?</i>

24:35.000 --> 24:37.838
<i>I just hope the administration</i>
<i>does the right thing</i>

24:37.840 --> 24:39.398
<i>and shuts down the musical.</i>

24:39.400 --> 24:43.160
<i>I don't want Satanism in my school.</i>
<i>Do you?</i>

24:44.440 --> 24:47.400
<i>All I know is that Heather Chandler</i>
<i>is over.</i>

25:20.600 --> 25:22.078
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

25:22.080 --> 25:24.278
<i>one of the most important parts</i>
<i>of a relationship</i>

25:24.280 --> 25:26.200
<i>is getting along with the parents.</i>

25:31.520 --> 25:32.960
Poor thing.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.598
-Look at you!
-Hi!

25:36.600 --> 25:39.158
Hi! Aren't you just the world's
best girlfriend.

25:39.160 --> 25:42.038
Sitting here all night,
keeping JD company.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.518
Bud is just so thankful. Bud!

25:44.520 --> 25:47.278
You know how men are with emotions.
Stiff upper lip.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.838
Plus, I don't think he'll ever get over
what JD did to that Porsche.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.480
That was expensive.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.478
I like that. That's cute.
I wish I could wear that shade.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.518
Bud! Veronica here has been
caring for your son all damn night,

26:00.520 --> 26:03.238
I think the least you could do
is say hello.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.318
Hello, Veronica.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.838
Aren't we gonna thank her
for watching after JD?

26:07.840 --> 26:09.838
Thank you, Veronica.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.838
Men, I swear.
Is it really that hard to say thank you?

26:12.840 --> 26:15.200
It's like pulling panties off a pig.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.360
Now, go! Go say hi to your son.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.200
You're an embarrassment.
Just like your mother.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.638
Thanks for all your help, Veronica.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.800
I think JD has got a winner
in this girl, right here.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.960
-Let's go.
-Bye!

26:45.200 --> 26:49.278
<i>JD is so close to being</i>
<i>the perfect boyfriend, Diary.</i>

26:49.280 --> 26:53.958
<i>Clearly his father and the idiot</i>
<i>he's dating absolutely love me.</i>

26:53.960 --> 26:56.440
<i>But something still doesn't</i>
<i>feel quite right.</i>

26:57.560 --> 27:01.118
<i>Well, he has 24 hours</i>
<i>to figure it out.</i>

27:01.120 --> 27:04.398
<i>I hope for his sake he does.</i>

27:04.400 --> 27:07.118
-Expelled?
-I'm sorry, Heather,

27:07.120 --> 27:11.398
but the recommended punishment
for attempted murder is expulsion.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.398
Have fun being home schooled, Heather.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.318
Well, I'm sure that if I just
talk to Mrs. Duke

27:16.320 --> 27:18.798
we could come to an understanding.
Where is your mother, Heather?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.638
Probably in hell.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.160
Yeah, but your stepmother
is on her way, right, Heather?

28:20.360 --> 28:22.360
Is someone eating beef jerky?

28:28.080 --> 28:30.558
Young lady, this is a private meeting.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.118
I don't know what kind of school
you're running here, Ms. Fleming,

28:33.120 --> 28:34.598
but it certainly
doesn't seem appropriate

28:34.600 --> 28:36.278
to bring in an actual streetwalker

28:36.280 --> 28:38.678
to teach the children about the dangers
of the sex working industry.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.280
Streetwalker?

28:42.280 --> 28:44.278
I got this at the good mall.

28:44.280 --> 28:48.120
We really do need to cover up
in a learning environment.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.640
Let me tell you a story, lady.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.118
When I first started stripping
down at the Grab Bag,

28:56.120 --> 28:59.038
I kept an eye out for the high rollers,

28:59.040 --> 29:02.198
men with visible gold, fresh socks.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.518
Then one day this nerd walks in,

29:04.520 --> 29:09.038
and I gave him the same look
you're giving me now.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.438
But then, in the midst of my routine,

29:12.440 --> 29:17.480
when everyone else was tossing out
ones and fives...

29:18.880 --> 29:22.640
this guy... held up his phone

29:23.560 --> 29:28.080
and showed me the biggest
bank account balance I had ever seen.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.720
That man was your father.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.400
So, ma'am...

29:37.640 --> 29:40.638
when you judge by appearances,

29:40.640 --> 29:46.998
you might just overlook the hero
who changes your life.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.198
-I don't understand.
-Bitch,

29:49.200 --> 29:52.838
I was coming in here
to take your side.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.478
I hate this un-dead Rue McClanahan here.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.158
What? I didn't even do anything.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.318
You dare to cast judgment on me?

30:01.320 --> 30:06.878
My poor unfortunate stepson/daughter

30:06.880 --> 30:08.678
is never gonna feel safe

30:08.680 --> 30:12.560
until Heather is gone from Westerburg.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.198
What if we take Heather's car away?

30:17.200 --> 30:19.718
How much would it take

30:19.720 --> 30:22.920
for you to agree to that?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.680
My dignity is only worth 20 bucks?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.760
Okay.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.278
Well. Looks like we've come
to an agreement.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.480
And how am I supposed to get to school?

32:04.680 --> 32:06.080
I peed.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.840
I don't want to do this, JD.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.440
I don't want to hurt you.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.640
But you've left me with no choice.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.520
You have always looked at me as...

32:35.920 --> 32:38.598
an accessory. An accomplice.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.920
But is that really what you want
in a girlfriend?

32:42.840 --> 32:45.758
Just your dutiful first lady?

32:45.760 --> 32:48.918
Seen, but not heard?

32:48.920 --> 32:51.000
Other guys like that bullshit, but...

32:52.160 --> 32:53.960
I was so sure

32:55.040 --> 32:57.040
that you weren't like other guys.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.520
And yet...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.320
I don't even know

33:04.280 --> 33:06.238
that you respect me.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.918
Because if you did,

33:07.920 --> 33:11.360
why would you lie about Betty, JD?

33:12.600 --> 33:15.240
Why would you lie to an equal?

33:16.400 --> 33:17.720
Why?

33:20.360 --> 33:21.680
Answer me!

33:23.920 --> 33:25.560
I said, answer me!

33:39.720 --> 33:43.678
-Why would you throw that vase, JD?
-What?

33:43.680 --> 33:46.198
You just threw that vase. You...

33:46.200 --> 33:49.360
You went crazy.
I'm really scared, JD.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.120
You're right.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.920
I messed up.

33:58.360 --> 34:02.400
I lied because I'm weak,
and I don't deserve you.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.438
But I'll never do it again,

34:06.440 --> 34:09.239
because, Veronica,

34:10.280 --> 34:15.600
I love you so deeply and completely.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.679
You're lying to me.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.320
I'm not, my darling.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.237
Shut up.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.518
But why, Veronica?

34:29.520 --> 34:30.960
I love you.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.000
You still don't get it.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.159
You're not even close.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.560
I hope you like this little room...

34:45.080 --> 34:47.400
because you're never seeing
the outside of it.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.518
You love me.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.038
You think I'm amazing.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.680
You want to be me?

35:03.680 --> 35:05.040
Okay.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.598
<i>Known as the fastest predator</i>
<i>on the savannah,</i>

35:13.600 --> 35:17.198
<i>the cheetah corners its quarry.</i>

35:17.200 --> 35:19.358
-Run, you dumb baby bunny.
-Run, you dumb baby bunny.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.118
<i>The cheetahs work together</i>
<i>to corner the prey</i>

35:22.120 --> 35:23.800
<i>and take it down.</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:06.280
I ran into Betty's mom
at the grocery store today.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.798
She said they sent Betty away.
To military school.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.558
Betty? Why?
She always seemed like such a good kid.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.318
She didn't say why.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.440
Maybe she's been acting out lately.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.680
Do you think it's because of...

36:25.120 --> 36:28.238
-Where is she?
-In her room. Because of what happened.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.438
Anne, we only have a year
'till she's out of the house.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.038
I don't want to rock the boat.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.318
-But, Kevin, we need to talk--
-No, just drop it.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.920
We have our safety to think about, too.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.198
<i>Dear Diary,</i>
<i>well, there you have it.</i>

36:46.200 --> 36:48.318
<i>I have the perfect boyfriend</i>

36:48.320 --> 36:50.598
<i>with all the perfect things,</i>

36:50.600 --> 36:54.080
<i>like flowers and dinners and listening.</i>

36:55.400 --> 36:57.478
<i>And I hate it.</i>

36:57.480 --> 37:00.758
<i>I hate it because it's a lie.</i>

37:00.760 --> 37:04.518
<i>And the one thing I thought</i>
<i>I had with JD was the truth.</i>

37:04.520 --> 37:07.958
<i>Pure, honest, nothing-held-back truth.</i>

37:07.960 --> 37:09.680
<i>But that was a lie too.</i>

37:12.720 --> 37:15.238
<i>So now, I have no choice</i>

37:15.240 --> 37:17.800
<i>but to do this.</i>

37:20.120 --> 37:22.800
Three days are up.
You're free to go.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.200
No.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.880
Veronica.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.560
I loved you.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.478
Of course,
I was coming here to kill you,

38:32.480 --> 38:34.838
but that was only because I loved you.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.438
Suicide was for them,
not for us. Not--

38:38.440 --> 38:39.918
Not for you.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.438
There's never gonna be another girl
like you.

38:42.440 --> 38:46.958
You were the only girl like you,

38:46.960 --> 38:49.478
and you're right.
I didn't see that.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.878
I didn't see the girl that you were,
but that girl,

38:52.880 --> 38:55.478
she was even more amazing
than I could have ever imagined.

38:55.480 --> 39:01.078
I mean, she was even more sick and
twisted than I could ever hope to be.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.998
You blew up my car.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.400
You had me committed.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.080
And I loved that.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.520
I loved you, Veronica Sawyer.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.040
And I'm never going to
love anybody again.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.280
Oh, damn!

39:27.360 --> 39:29.280
Don't do anything
you're going to regret.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.238
The only thing that I want to do...

39:33.240 --> 39:34.560
is kiss you.
