WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.540
16645 Wagamash. Go get 'em, boys.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.900
You got it, Cap.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.900
- Hi.
- Morning.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.300
You, uh, you called about the lockout?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.449
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Ah!

00:19.450 --> 00:21.449
I came to check the mail.
I locked myself out.

00:21.450 --> 00:22.619
I thought about breaking the window,

00:22.620 --> 00:24.180
but this seemed more civilized.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.050
Hey, well, civility is what separates us

00:26.060 --> 00:28.120
from animals, right?

00:30.040 --> 00:31.529
Uh, do you... do you have your ID

00:31.530 --> 00:33.120
on you, ma'am, by any chance?

00:33.200 --> 00:36.260
Unfortunately, I don't
normally carry it in my PJs.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.880
- Oh! Right.
- Right.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.070
But it's inside, probably
next to my keys.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.460
Yeah. The problem is,

00:42.470 --> 00:43.800
we really should see your ID

00:43.810 --> 00:44.869
before we gain access to the...

00:44.870 --> 00:46.470
Oh, come on. It's my house.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.860
I bought it in 2012.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.020
I'm in my robe and slippers.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.400
I can see that.

00:51.460 --> 00:55.149
And I left the curling iron
on inside next to a magazine.

00:55.150 --> 00:56.740
None of us want a fire... am I right?

00:56.770 --> 00:59.689
Uh-oh. She speaks firefighter.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.420
Fluently. "Firelingual."

01:01.480 --> 01:03.959
- Oh!
- That's great.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.059
- Wow.
- That's...

01:06.060 --> 01:07.260
So, um...

01:07.280 --> 01:09.159
- Uh.
- Oh, yeah.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.250
- I mean, um, uh...
- I think we can...

01:10.270 --> 01:12.340
- Yeah, let's...
- Okay.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.700
Three years of musical theater.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.800
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.440
- I didn't do it for all four years.
- Give me the half millimeter.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.909
Yes. Uh.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.170
- The one smaller.
- Yes.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.000
- Sorry. One second.
- Oh.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.080
- Take your time.
- Stay with me, Eddie.

01:23.090 --> 01:24.500
I'm a tenor sometimes.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.500
Other times, I like to keep
it, uh, I don't know...

01:28.520 --> 01:30.249
- Oh, oh.
- Oh. That's got it. Ma'am.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.599
- Yeah. Of course.
- Thank you so much.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.340
Better get to that curling iron.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.120
Right.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.589
- She was something else, huh?
- She was.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.660
- I think she liked you, man.
- Yeah, I felt that.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.729
There was some tension, huh?

01:40.730 --> 01:41.920
- Oh, man.
- I was down there.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.529
Hey! Let's go, boys!

01:43.530 --> 01:45.529
Okay. Uh.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.560
♪ See you later ♪

01:47.580 --> 01:48.600
Let's go!

01:50.260 --> 01:51.680
Everything cool with the lockout?

01:51.710 --> 01:54.270
You know, you need a phone
app with facial recognition

01:54.280 --> 01:55.859
so that you can just aim it at somebody

01:55.860 --> 01:57.079
and it tells you who
they are, kind of like

01:57.080 --> 01:58.400
Shazam, but with faces.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.940
Sure. You could call it "Who Dat?"

02:00.920 --> 02:02.000
Who Dat? Who Dat?

02:02.010 --> 02:03.019
- Yeah, Who Dat?
- Yeah, Who Dat?

02:03.020 --> 02:04.949
for the phone so that
I could be What Dat?

02:04.950 --> 02:06.139
- Oh, yeah.
- Right? You just point your phone at stuff

02:06.140 --> 02:07.149
- that you don't recognize.
- Yeah.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.639
- Wait a minute... What Dat?
- What species of bird is that?

02:09.660 --> 02:11.089
What kind of a joint is that?

02:11.090 --> 02:12.540
What do you mean joint? Like weed?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.160
No, no, like a plumber's joint.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.629
Oh, like a bar that
plumbers hang out in.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.969
Uh, no, like, uh, an elbow joint,

02:17.970 --> 02:19.699
but something less
famous, like a U-bend,

02:19.700 --> 02:21.969
although an app that does
plumber bars would be fun, too.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.569
Oh, the rusty pipe is .4 miles away.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.760
No, no, it's too dirty.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.580
I want the invisible ass crack.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.640
Engine 24, motor vehicle...

02:30.650 --> 02:31.760
corner of Oak and Milton.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.620
All right, buckle up.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.580
So, uh, how was that lockout lady?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.320
- Was she nice?
- Oh, real sweetheart.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.349
Couldn't have been nicer.

02:39.350 --> 02:41.680
It makes the job so much
better when they're that nice.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.819
All right, boys, make sure
the ignitions are off

03:11.820 --> 03:13.500
on those cars and check
for leaking fluids.

03:13.510 --> 03:14.540
I'll check for injuries.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.640
What's up, Pikachu?

03:17.680 --> 03:18.820
Hey, Liz.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.219
What are you guys doing here?

03:21.220 --> 03:22.260
Why haven't you stopped traffic?

03:22.280 --> 03:23.629
Tiny, little fender bender.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.000
The cars are going around. It's fine.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.180
Yeah, it's not fine.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.099
- It isn't safe. Stop the traffic.
- Andy.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.639
Check this out.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.709
Do you know what a pain
in the ass that is?

03:31.710 --> 03:33.439
Everything's gonna get backed up.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.350
Yeah, it's more important
that nobody gets hurt.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.539
Aw, come on, man. We're
almost done here.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.449
The tow-truck driver
even said it was fine.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.719
Oh, the tow-truck driver
said it was fine?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.819
Shut it down now, fathead. Let's go.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.340
Or do I have to call Captain Polonsky?

03:47.460 --> 03:48.800
Let's go.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.080
Let's go.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.680
Yeah, move slower.

03:53.530 --> 03:54.659
This will be good.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.160
You're killing it.

03:57.180 --> 03:59.480
Keep it moving, people. Let's move.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.739
Come on. I got to get to work.

04:03.740 --> 04:04.869
Should have left earlier.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.579
Not my problem. Keep it moving.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.780
At least the firemen are here.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.880
- Those guys are awesome.
- Oh, get out of here!

04:09.900 --> 04:11.079
Come on, move!

04:11.080 --> 04:14.890
24, we've got a car fire
at 16645 Wagamash Street.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.919
Why does that sound familiar?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.579
Apparently, a woman in a
robe lit a Trans Am on fire.

04:18.579 --> 04:20.089
- Oh, snap.
- Oh, snap.

04:20.089 --> 04:24.020
Repeat... Trans Am on fire
at 16645 Wagamash Street.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.159
16645 Wagamash Street?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.959
That's my house.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.660
That's my Trans Am!

04:30.720 --> 04:32.080
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.839
Oh.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.999
Ohh!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.499
- Yeah.
- Chief.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.820
Look at this.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.680
The Relia-star SA-5000 Ladder Truck.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.710
Extends 125 feet. Look at that.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.090
All right, GPS, Wi-Fi,

04:48.100 --> 04:50.540
backup camera, seat
warmers, and it's ours.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.060
Guys, the requisition
came through yesterday.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.859
- All right.
- I'm gonna meet with Linda Price today.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.260
She's gonna give us the
stamp of approval.

04:55.270 --> 04:56.579
Chief, something bad happened.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.099
How bad?

04:58.100 --> 05:00.600
- Penisi!
- I'll let him tell you.

05:00.620 --> 05:03.169
- Oh, boy.
- You stupid son of a bitch!

05:03.170 --> 05:04.179
I ought to...

05:04.180 --> 05:05.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:05.600 --> 05:08.199
- Okay.
- Polonsky, what's going on here?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.819
I'll tell you what's going on.
Shuck's psycho ex-girlfriend

05:10.820 --> 05:13.409
set his car on fire
because of these idiots.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.339
- What are you talking about?
- They let her into my house!

05:15.340 --> 05:16.599
Dude, she said she was locked out.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.609
You checked her ID, right?

05:17.610 --> 05:20.240
We asked for an ID.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.279
- You did this on purpose.
- That's absurd.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.280
We had no idea it was your
house or your girlfriend.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.700
I mean, she's like an
8, and you're a 4...

05:26.780 --> 05:28.359
no offense.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.089
Hey, what are you smirking at, Pikachu?

05:31.090 --> 05:33.229
Nothing. I mean, we were just jok...

05:33.230 --> 05:34.700
well, everybody's joking around, right?

05:34.720 --> 05:36.160
All right, the real question is,

05:36.170 --> 05:38.240
what are you gonna do
to make this right?

05:38.280 --> 05:40.360
- It was a mistake. Come on.
- Okay.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.760
How about, uh, suspensions
without pay for these boneheads?

05:43.800 --> 05:44.829
Come on, Jerry.

05:44.830 --> 05:45.840
- Terry.
- Jerry.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.239
- Terry.
- Jerry.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.540
- Terry.
- Hey, guys.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.849
So, a mom and son gave
us a box of Popsicles

05:52.850 --> 05:55.379
to say thank you for being so awesome.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.649
Oh! None for you.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.799
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.860
I guess we didn't know you'd be here.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.059
Whatever.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.720
It's not hot enough for Popsicles.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.240
- It's delicious.
- Mmm.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.990
So, what are you gonna do?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.459
Okay, how about this?

06:08.460 --> 06:09.660
I'm gonna ban lockouts.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.929
Firefighters will no longer
let people into their houses.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.570
- Let the cops do it.
- Oh, come on, Chief.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.069
- Okay?
- Don't do that to us.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.600
That's why I became a firefighter.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.539
- I am heartbroken.
- Okay.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.589
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:19.590 --> 06:20.899
- Okay.
- Okay. Play it that way.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.019
- Mm-hmm.
- Just know that you could have prevented

06:23.020 --> 06:24.030
what's coming.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.280
Wait. What's that supposed to mean?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.749
It means good luck
getting home tonight...

06:27.750 --> 06:28.949
Pikachu.

06:28.950 --> 06:30.980
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.240
Oooh.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.820
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:35.830 --> 06:37.620
Shuck!

06:43.830 --> 06:45.120
Unbelievable.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.979
A boot on every wheel?

06:46.980 --> 06:49.480
I mean, it's a little bit over the top.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.300
Somebody get the bolt cutters
and take care of this.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.370
Man, we need to get revenge.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.240
Damn right we do. They
hit the Chief's SUV.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.449
God, these guys are assholes.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.110
Hey, man, what's up
with you and Salazar?

07:01.120 --> 07:02.700
Oh, we dated in high school.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.119
Is that why she calls
you, uh, "Pikachu,"

07:05.120 --> 07:07.050
because you're her Pokémon?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.589
No, because I dumped her,

07:08.590 --> 07:10.099
and then she beat the shit out of me,

07:10.100 --> 07:11.820
and then she called me
"Pikachu" ever since.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.600
I don't know. It just...

07:14.620 --> 07:16.619
feels mildly racist, but I'm not sure.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.000
So, why'd you break up with her?

07:18.010 --> 07:19.399
Our parts didn't line up.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.100
Hey, you know what? Regardless,

07:21.110 --> 07:22.669
you need to stick up for yourself.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.310
Really? I guess so.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.020
Hm.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.699
Hey, it is racist.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.640
- You looked it up?
- Yeah. Look, look. Here it is.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.580
Terry.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.419
- We need to retaliate.
- No, we can't.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.619
What are you talking about? Why not?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.619
You remember the FD-PD Feud of 2006?

07:41.620 --> 07:42.780
How could I forget?

07:44.760 --> 07:46.029
All the more reason to retaliate.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.829
Look, I want to hit them
back as much as you do,

07:47.830 --> 07:49.099
but we can't let it get out of control.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.139
What's going on here?

07:50.140 --> 07:52.099
In 2006, you were right there with me.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.380
Yeah. How could I forget?

07:54.160 --> 07:55.280
Okay.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.500
But I want that SA-5000
Ladder Truck, okay?

07:57.510 --> 07:59.109
And if we get in a feud with the PD

07:59.110 --> 08:01.240
and Linda Price finds out,
we're done... no truck.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.909
This is bigger than a truck, Terry.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.090
This is about our dignity.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.849
No. Nothing's bigger than a truck.

08:05.850 --> 08:06.860
Don't hit back...

08:06.880 --> 08:08.560
that's an order from
your superior officer.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.260
- Okay. I'll tell the guys.
- Good.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.519
You got to twist it out.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.300
- No, you just got to get behind it, man.
- Hey.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.459
Great news, guys.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.480
Chief says we can retaliate,

08:18.520 --> 08:20.740
but he doesn't want to know about it.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.720
That way, if he's questioned,
he can play dumb...

08:22.740 --> 08:24.560
plausible deniability.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.880
Combustible pliability,
just like I was saying.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.040
That, too. So we're gonna hit 'em hard.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.940
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

08:32.010 --> 08:34.280
Okay, but it's a secret, so
keep it down when you cheer.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.169
What the frick?!

08:58.170 --> 08:59.640
There's no gas!

09:05.680 --> 09:07.039
Oh, what the fuck?!

09:07.040 --> 09:08.579
What's up with the water?!

09:08.580 --> 09:10.620
Oh, yeah.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.510
I was thinking that we
would drive to Seattle,

09:13.520 --> 09:14.939
get matching tattoos,

09:14.940 --> 09:19.020
and then hit a Major League Soccer game.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.280
Yeah.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.170
Baby, why would you have
to bring up my wife?

09:22.180 --> 09:24.040
The gas and water just got cut off.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.140
Let me call you back, baby.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.259
What the fuck?!

09:28.260 --> 09:29.660
This is wack.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.270
This is really wack.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.300
_

09:36.840 --> 09:38.150
_

09:39.060 --> 09:41.180
_

09:43.680 --> 09:46.150
Son of a...

09:47.700 --> 09:50.219
Do you guys remember SARS?

09:50.220 --> 09:51.949
- Mm-hmm.
- The disease?

09:51.950 --> 09:53.419
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Yeah, dude...

09:53.420 --> 09:56.420
Those ladies over there
just gave us free tacos.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.059
- What?
- Oh, my God.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.340
- Oh.
- Thank you so much.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.159
- Thank you.
- Sisters. Thank you.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.170
- Wow.
- Oh, man.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.120
When was the last time you
saw nuns eating tacos?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.300
I know. I thought they all
ate at the Hamburger Habit.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.099
- Oh!
- Habit.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.980
I know. I'm hysterical.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.509
Well, well, well.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.680
If it isn't the Department
of Water and Power.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.840
Well, if you have any questions,

10:15.850 --> 10:19.299
you can visit us at www.IZapYourMom.org.

10:20.330 --> 10:21.800
Not funny, asshole.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.319
My scalp is on fire right now

10:24.320 --> 10:26.540
because I haven't been able
to rinse out my lice shampoo.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.059
- Ugh.
- You don't have to admit that, you know?

10:28.060 --> 10:29.179
You could've just said "shampoo."

10:29.180 --> 10:30.189
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's gross, right.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.760
- Just straight shampoo.
- I mean, we appreciate your honesty,

10:31.770 --> 10:33.790
but can you step away
from the tacos, please?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.060
Oh, what... you get some
tacos from some nuns,

10:36.070 --> 10:38.460
and suddenly, you guys are all that?

10:38.470 --> 10:43.440
Yeah? Just be aware this
feud is officially on, okay?

10:43.480 --> 10:45.200
I'm gonna work you like pizza dough.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.280
I mean, you actually knead pizza dough.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.400
No, that's the last thing I need...
goes straight to my hips.

10:49.410 --> 10:50.600
- Oh!
- Hey.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.540
- Come on. You kidding me?
- You got to...

10:52.550 --> 10:54.010
You can't... You can't turn this off.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.060
Laugh it up.

10:55.890 --> 10:57.919
- We're gonna nail you.
- In the ass.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.240
Expect it when you least expect it.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.419
Well, you got to be more specific,

11:01.420 --> 11:02.580
'cause I'm always expecting it.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.399
Oh, okay. Can I see that?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.819
Oh, thanks. Oh, oops.

11:05.820 --> 11:07.139
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.959
Gross. That's mine.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.360
Remember when I stuffed you
in a locker upside down?

11:11.430 --> 11:13.680
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna do it again, Pikachu.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.110
This shit is on like Michelle Kwan,

11:18.200 --> 11:19.960
and none of you are safe.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.759
- Wow.
- What's up?!

11:28.120 --> 11:30.000
- Hey. How do I look?
- Total CHILF.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.540
- Huh?
- Where you going?

11:31.550 --> 11:32.620
I'm going to the meeting
with Linda Price

11:32.630 --> 11:34.099
and the budget committee.
I'm gonna seal the deal

11:34.100 --> 11:35.400
on the new truck.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.920
I got to tell you something.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.729
Unless there's a fire
burning, it can wait.

11:38.730 --> 11:41.240
Okay. Just keep an eye out for the cops,

11:41.260 --> 11:42.840
in case they want to hit
us with another prank.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.570
Oh, come on. They're
not gonna hit us twice

11:44.580 --> 11:45.589
without us retaliating.

11:45.590 --> 11:46.960
That'd be a breach of feud protocol.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.850
Yeah, yeah. It would.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.480
Hey, you know what? Thank
you for not retaliating.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.209
I really appreciate it.

11:53.210 --> 11:56.079
As a reward, I'm gonna let you
drive the new truck first.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.279
Oh. Oh.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.549
- Thank you.
- Good work, Penisi!

11:59.550 --> 12:01.950
Yeah, okay.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.550
Hey, man, I've been thinking,
and your fear of Salazar

12:04.560 --> 12:06.689
is making me really uncomfortable, man.

12:06.690 --> 12:08.440
Like, you got to stick up for yourself.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.489
Honestly, I love being pushed
around by dominant women.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.020
It's like a mouse being
batted around by a cat.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.800
It's just a thing I'm into.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.899
- Oh, you mean a fetish?
- No, not a fetish... a thing.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.080
- Oh, that's definitely a fetish.
- No, no, no. It's a thing.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.070
It's like I just like
to have sex with things

12:25.080 --> 12:26.309
that are much bigger than me.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.879
It's like if Humpty
Dumpty fucked the wall.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.889
Okay.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.080
You've never experienced what it's like

12:31.100 --> 12:32.990
to be pushed around by a taller woman?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.720
I mean, she'd have to
be like Madea-sized.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.350
- Right.
- Like, Tyler Perry-sized.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.989
Yeah, well, you owe yourself to try it.

12:37.990 --> 12:38.990
You'll never go back.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.819
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.959
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.659
My daughter and I wanted
to show our appreciation

12:45.660 --> 12:47.059
for all that you do.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.180
We brought you doughnuts.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.660
Are you kidding? This is great.

12:49.670 --> 12:51.240
- You did not have to do that.
- Thank you so much.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.460
Ooh, look at those.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.730
- Tasty.
- Huh?

12:53.740 --> 12:55.199
- Yeah.
- I like that.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.499
- So...
- What?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.869
Oh, what the hell, Ike?!

12:57.870 --> 12:59.269
No.

12:59.270 --> 13:00.550
Where'd you get those doughnuts?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.879
Hey, sweetheart, did the cops
give you those doughnuts?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.279
I-I bought them from Nut Nuts.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.990
Oh, Nut Nuts. That sounds reasonable.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.719
Hey, do me a favor.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.689
Why don't you go ahead and
take a bite for me, then?

13:11.690 --> 13:12.949
Oh, no, they're for you guys.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.740
- Yeah, have the first bite.
- No, thank you.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.200
Hey, you brought them here. Go ahead.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.619
No, please get that
doughnut out of my face.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.689
How about you, sweetheart?
Would you like a bite?

13:18.690 --> 13:20.020
But we're not gonna talk to him anymore.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.959
- Thank you so much.
- It's against the law to lie to a fireman.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.599
- You know that, right, sweetheart?
- Okay, there we go. We're done.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.429
Come on, sweetheart. We're gonna go.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.779
- Thank you.
- Don't trust the police,

13:26.780 --> 13:27.799
- okay?
- Ohh!

13:27.800 --> 13:29.369
What the hell is wrong with you, Ike?!

13:29.370 --> 13:32.439
- Hey.
- She's lying, man. I-I...

13:32.440 --> 13:34.439
Oh, man! What am I doing?!

13:34.440 --> 13:36.840
Ohh! Ohh!

13:36.850 --> 13:38.709
This feud's getting to me, man.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.510
Oh, she's just a little
girl! What'd I do?

13:40.520 --> 13:41.569
All right, listen, listen, man.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.640
We cannot let this feud get to us, okay?

13:43.660 --> 13:46.080
If we don't eat these
doughnuts, then the cops win.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.459
Granny's right. Take the first bite.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.989
- Oh, I'm good.
- Listen, boys.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.189
I'm going up top. I'm gonna keep watch.

13:52.190 --> 13:53.859
If I say, "Zippo, zippo, nine,"

13:53.860 --> 13:55.380
that means there's trouble, all right?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.260
Stay vigilant, boys.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.080
Tonight, we go to the mattresses.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.999
To the mattresses!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.339
We got to leave those steroids alone.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.420
Seriously.

14:03.450 --> 14:04.939
This is bad.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.840
I just let Terry go without
warning him he's in danger.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.339
Wait. I thought Chief wasn't supposed

14:08.340 --> 14:09.350
to know about this stuff.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.819
Um.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.080
Hey, what's this... Nut Nuts?

14:13.100 --> 14:15.380
It... Ah.

14:22.410 --> 14:24.040
_

14:28.430 --> 14:29.500
- _
- Eddie.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.480
Come on!

14:35.800 --> 14:38.769
_

14:38.770 --> 14:40.660
I don't like texting and driving, Eddie.

14:44.710 --> 14:45.960
Damn autocorrect!

14:45.970 --> 14:48.000
_

14:50.000 --> 14:51.500
Oh, come on, Eddie!

14:52.920 --> 14:55.720
"You know I ate Mexican
dribbling penicillin"?

14:55.730 --> 14:57.790
Does this make any sense to you guys?

15:00.260 --> 15:01.530
Mnh. No.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.840
What is that... a riddle?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.740
Let's go! I'm late for a meeting!

15:15.840 --> 15:17.540
License and registration, please.

15:17.580 --> 15:18.589
Are you serious?

15:18.590 --> 15:20.549
We got you texting and driving.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.499
License and registration.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.540
Were you guys tailing me?

15:23.550 --> 15:25.460
No. Just taking a bite out of crime.

15:25.470 --> 15:26.690
All right, cut the shit, Salazar.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.139
I got a meeting at the City Council.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.500
No one's above the law, McConky.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.289
Step out of the vehicle.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.380
The hell I will.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.060
Oh, yeah?

15:36.230 --> 15:37.629
Okay, shit for brains.

15:37.630 --> 15:38.719
Pull back, McConky.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.969
I'm the Fire Chief, and I'll be
sure to tell the City Council

15:40.970 --> 15:42.400
that I'm late because a couple of...

15:42.410 --> 15:45.280
Aah!

15:53.480 --> 15:55.880
Ah, boy. He's pissed.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.080
I should probably tell you guys

15:57.090 --> 15:58.749
Chief actually told me not to retaliate,

15:58.750 --> 16:00.100
- and I disobeyed him.
- What?

16:00.140 --> 16:01.289
Why would you tell us that now?

16:01.290 --> 16:02.719
We don't even have anywhere to hide.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.559
- Hey, Luce.
- Hey, Uncle Eddie.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.569
- Lucy.
- Hey.

16:05.570 --> 16:06.959
- What's up?
- Yeah, what's up, guys?

16:06.960 --> 16:09.159
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, there they are.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.369
What are you guys playing...
"Minecraft" or... ?

16:11.370 --> 16:12.829
Nah. Talk to you after.

16:12.830 --> 16:13.899
Hey, they took my license

16:13.900 --> 16:15.240
'cause I was texting
and driving with you.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.439
Wait. That's what you're mad about?

16:16.440 --> 16:17.479
Yeah, that's what I'm mad about.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.920
You know I hate texting and driving.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.050
Do you guys have any idea
how much shit my dad

16:22.060 --> 16:23.240
gives me for texting and driving?

16:23.250 --> 16:25.779
Check this out. I took a
selfie in the jail cell.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.649
Oh! Looks like he's doing something.

16:27.650 --> 16:28.919
- Oh, that's hilarious.
- Aww.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.649
All right, enough. Come on.
Come on. You got to go.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.800
- Let's go.
- All right, Dad.

16:31.820 --> 16:32.830
Real proud of you.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.450
Hey, how's Fire Academy going, Luce?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.799
Pretty good. I just aced my
hazardous materials exam.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.659
- Mm.
- Oh, congrats.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.980
You are the "as-best-os."

16:42.300 --> 16:43.480
Good one.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.069
Yeah, now.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.340
I'll use that at the Academy.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.890
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.199
- Take it easy, Luce.
- Bye, girls.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.939
See you later.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.020
Gangnam Style.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.270
Those girls are so excited
to see me every time.

16:54.820 --> 16:55.920
God damn it!

16:55.960 --> 16:57.279
Sorry about the texting and driving.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.300
It's not your fault.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.120
Everyone knows, in a
feud, it's tit for tat.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.320
They hit us twice in a row.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.480
They tit-tit-tatted us!

17:03.490 --> 17:06.289
I'm the Chief! I'm
supposed to be off-limits.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.559
You know, I feel like
I'm a little to blame.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.020
No, no. Don't say that, okay?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.869
You tried to warn me, and
I thank you for that.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.299
- McConky.
- Chief.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.160
Linda Price here with a helpful tip...

17:17.170 --> 17:18.829
when a budget committee
is going to allocate

17:18.829 --> 17:20.299
half a million bucks to you,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.039
it's a good idea to show
up for the meeting.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.169
- Linda, I can explain.
- Too late.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.630
They're giving the money to the police

17:25.640 --> 17:27.040
for an armored truck.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.639
What?! They don't need that.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.909
Sorry, Chief.

17:29.910 --> 17:31.440
Maybe next year.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.860
You know what?

17:33.880 --> 17:36.340
You were right... we
should have retaliated.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.990
Still nothing from Chief.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.869
Is he all right?

17:48.870 --> 17:49.879
Whoa.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.320
Hey, what the hell you guys doing here?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.640
We want to talk. Can we sit?

17:56.540 --> 17:58.270
Yeah.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.140
I know we've had our differences,

18:04.150 --> 18:07.260
but we respect your chief.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.520
- Mm.
- And what my guys did, well,

18:09.540 --> 18:10.959
they crossed the line,

18:10.960 --> 18:14.350
they went a little rogue, and it was...

18:14.360 --> 18:15.600
unprofessional.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.620
Guys?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.359
All right.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.429
- Mnh.
- Shuck!

18:21.430 --> 18:22.759
Sorry.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.229
Just...

18:25.230 --> 18:29.120
took me two calendar years
to restore that Trans Am.

18:29.140 --> 18:33.570
I mean, we're talking 400
horsepower, dual rear exhaust,

18:33.580 --> 18:36.019
Super Comp headers, custom driveshaft.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.580
I mean, she was my girl!

18:38.600 --> 18:39.610
Yeah.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.140
So when Kimmy burned her, I went nut,

18:43.180 --> 18:44.440
and I blamed y'all.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.540
Was that misplaced rage?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.259
Yes.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.920
Yes, it was.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.259
And I'm sorry...

18:53.260 --> 18:55.080
for going nut...

18:56.730 --> 18:58.160
on all of you.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.420
Mm.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.920
Hey!

19:33.770 --> 19:37.240
Kids bring you guys Popsicles.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.770
Nuns buy you guys taco lunches.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.719
Everybody just thinks you're heroes.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.729
What do they think about us?

19:42.730 --> 19:44.720
They think we're just jerks
who give out tickets.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.149
And it hurts.

19:47.150 --> 19:48.449
I know it does, yeah.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.220
It hurts 'cause I'm a good guy.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.079
- You are.
- I'm a good guy.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.989
I like tacos, and I like Popsicles.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.320
We'll get some on the ride home.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.440
I know, but we have to buy 'em...

19:57.460 --> 19:58.600
they don't have to buy 'em.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.800
I made it hard on you.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.620
I asked you to wear platform
shoes, but I loved you.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.319
After you dumped me, I started
calling you "Pikachu"

20:12.320 --> 20:14.300
because it made me feel
better to diminish you,

20:14.380 --> 20:16.760
and I'm sorry for that.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.440
If you'd find it in your heart...

20:19.450 --> 20:21.300
I reject this apology.

20:22.150 --> 20:23.200
What?

20:23.240 --> 20:25.689
I am saying I reject
this apology, ma'am.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.980
Slap me if you must.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.920
For a little man, you
just made a huge mistake!

20:39.230 --> 20:42.660
Hey, uh, you all right?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.499
Ohh.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.200
You're a sick son of a bitch.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.280
You really got to try that sometime.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.449
- Ugh, man.
- Ohh, man.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.180
I was taken out.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.249
How's that, Polonsky?!

20:56.250 --> 20:57.919
Yeah, come on!

20:57.920 --> 21:00.050
Come on, Polonsky! Come on!

21:00.060 --> 21:03.240
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

21:03.620 --> 21:04.860
So, what do you say?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.929
- Truce?
- I don't know.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.480
Maybe with a gesture of good faith.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.920
- What do you have in mind?
- Mm.

21:25.620 --> 21:26.920
We want the fire truck.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.570
Yeah, you call the budget
committee right now

21:29.580 --> 21:31.080
and have them allocate
those funds to us.

21:31.140 --> 21:33.150
Come on, Penisi. Be realistic.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.450
Polonsky, these two
assclowns hit our chief,

21:35.460 --> 21:36.820
which means you're up next.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.089
Now, you can end this right now,

21:38.090 --> 21:39.739
or it's gonna be 2006 all over again.

21:39.740 --> 21:40.890
You remember what happened back then?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.360
How could I forget?

21:42.970 --> 21:45.619
- Courtesy of Captain Penisi.
- Oh.

21:45.620 --> 21:47.000
- Mm.
- All right, what do you say?

21:47.920 --> 21:50.660
Hey. You're still at 2456 Maple, right?

21:51.910 --> 21:53.909
Fine. You get the truck.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.080
- Okay?
- All right.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.340
Truce.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.280
Come on. Is the spit a deal-breaker?

22:00.300 --> 22:01.560
Yeah. Kind of.

22:03.210 --> 22:04.500
Okay.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.240
- Truce.
- Truce.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.200
First responder to first responder.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.060
Son of a bitch! Would you look at this?

22:15.130 --> 22:17.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.560
God damn it!

22:19.440 --> 22:21.269
- Oh!
- Oh!

22:21.270 --> 22:24.139
Chief, Chief, Chief, Chief, Chief!

22:25.880 --> 22:27.300
That's our Chief!

22:27.340 --> 22:28.540
Hey, Terry.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.420
Eddie, you'll never
guess what I'm doing.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.179
I'm trashing Polonsky's office.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.280
Terry, please stop pissing
in the fish tank.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.319
What are you talking about? You
love pissing in fish tanks.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.340
That's your move!

22:37.350 --> 22:38.949
Wait a minute.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.820
How do you know I'm
pissing in the fish tank?

22:47.930 --> 22:50.480
- Terry.
- Jerry.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.129
- Hey.
- Chief. Chief.

22:52.130 --> 22:53.530
- Oh!
- Hey, man, we got you something.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.799
- Oh, there he is.
- Yeah.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.539
- Oh, great.
- You done good.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.040
- Didn't even rat us out.
- Yeah.

22:58.060 --> 22:59.069
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

22:59.070 --> 23:00.549
Hey, on a good note, I got my law degree

23:00.550 --> 23:01.559
while I was on the inside.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.569
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:02.570 --> 23:04.039
- Congrats.
- That's using your time wisely.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.049
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Nice.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.059
- Good job.
- Wait.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.400
What's going on with
your face? What's that?

23:07.460 --> 23:08.470
What do you mean?

23:08.480 --> 23:10.819
Chief, did you murder someone in there?

23:10.820 --> 23:12.639
What?

23:12.640 --> 23:13.649
What are you doing? Get...

23:13.650 --> 23:14.950
- Stay still.
- What are you... Get...

23:14.960 --> 23:17.060
- Oh, no, just a little schmutz.
- Yeah.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.360
So, what's going on with these mutants?

23:18.430 --> 23:19.629
Feud's over.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.100
We all did some regrettable things.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.229
But we're gonna bury it.

23:22.230 --> 23:23.470
Although Polonsky did tell me that,

23:23.480 --> 23:25.019
a couple hours before I got pulled over,

23:25.020 --> 23:28.039
you guys cut the water and
gas to the police station.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.820
Yeah. That, uh, sounds like
something Polonsky would say.

23:30.860 --> 23:31.909
- Classic Polonsky.
- Yeah.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.370
Eddie...

23:33.380 --> 23:34.770
I know it was you.

23:34.780 --> 23:35.820
What?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.899
- Oh!
- Oh!

23:37.900 --> 23:39.480
Yeah! Yeah!

23:40.720 --> 23:42.240
Oh.

23:42.270 --> 23:44.720
Will the ringleader of the
retaliation please step forward?

23:44.750 --> 23:46.789
Nobody did anything.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.919
Eddie, I still know it was you.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.160
What?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.589
Oh!

23:51.590 --> 23:53.590
Aah!

23:53.600 --> 23:55.780
Yeah! Yeah!

23:55.900 --> 23:57.800
Ohh.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.199
Did you do it?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.720
If I admit it, you gonna
shiv me and slash my throat?

24:01.740 --> 24:03.920
- Mm, probably not.
- Yeah, I did it.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.409
- Ah.
- Yeah, no shit.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.380
So, wait, wait. Who
gets the truck, then?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.850
Well, when Linda Price got wind of this,

24:08.860 --> 24:10.860
she decided that neither
of us gets the money.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.479
Wait. So all that money
is still in there?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.740
I don't know who they gave it to.

24:13.760 --> 24:17.200
♪ It's so easy, but you know
it is a mackin' sleazy ♪

24:17.220 --> 24:20.550
