00:01.880 --> 00:03.347
You are being watched.

00:04.354 --> 00:06.310
The government has a secret system...

00:06.624 --> 00:07.689
a machine...

00:07.822 --> 00:10.457
that spies on you every hour of every day.

00:11.118 --> 00:13.406
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.532 --> 00:14.910
but it sees everything...

00:15.250 --> 00:17.887
violent crimes involving ordinary people.

00:18.322 --> 00:21.438
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.856
We don't.

00:22.858 --> 00:28.028
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.863
You will never find us.

00:29.865 --> 00:32.031
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.034 --> 00:35.068
if your number's up, we'll find you.

He's making a play for it.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.583
Wants to be the man in charge.

00:49.585 --> 00:51.652
I got other ideas of what to do with him.

00:56.658 --> 00:58.559
What about the loose ends?

00:58.561 --> 01:01.762
I'll take care of them.

01:22.284 --> 01:24.124
Something you'd like to say
to me, Mr. Reese?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.966
- Just if you ever want...
- No, I don't need

01:25.967 --> 01:28.789
to talk about it.

01:28.791 --> 01:31.542
I was gonna say if you
ever wanna grab a beer,

01:31.544 --> 01:33.093
let me know.

01:33.095 --> 01:34.578
I see it's sleeping here now.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.598
Bear's friendly.
You'll like him.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.417
Doesn't look like much
of a conversationalist.

01:40.419 --> 01:42.085
He's not, but if anyone ever messes

01:42.087 --> 01:44.021
with you, he'll eat 'em.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.395
Sorry.

01:51.397 --> 01:53.730
Thought I got everything.

01:53.732 --> 01:56.600
We have a new number.

01:56.602 --> 01:59.736
Sofia Campos.
21.

01:59.738 --> 02:02.289
Daughter of Hector Campos.

02:02.291 --> 02:03.707
He's a Brazilian diplomat...

02:03.709 --> 02:06.076
At the consulate here in New York, I know.

02:06.078 --> 02:07.828
As the family member of a diplomat,

02:07.830 --> 02:11.498
she's assigned a transient
social security number.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.783
It's good to have you back.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.810
Sofia was born in Sao Paulo,

02:23.812 --> 02:25.345
educated in Switzerland.

02:25.347 --> 02:27.948
She speaks six languages.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.133
Her mother died of cancer five years ago.

02:30.135 --> 02:33.637
Sofia deferred admission to Oxford.

02:33.639 --> 02:37.574
Traveled with her father
to three different postings...

02:37.576 --> 02:39.776
Berlin, Milan, Moscow.

02:39.778 --> 02:42.029
Her father's political party
took some heat

02:42.031 --> 02:43.930
for fraud in the last election.

02:43.932 --> 02:45.482
Her country's no stranger

02:45.484 --> 02:47.534
to politically motivated kidnappings.

02:47.536 --> 02:49.453
There are whisperings that Hector will run

02:49.455 --> 02:51.705
for the Brazilian presidency this year.

02:51.707 --> 02:54.675
If somebody wanted to get at dad,

02:54.677 --> 02:56.927
they might go after Sofia.

02:56.929 --> 02:59.162
That explains the bodyguard.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.833
Heel.
Now, stay.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.852
If you follow me around like a puppy,

03:05.854 --> 03:10.307
I'll treat you like one.

03:10.309 --> 03:11.858
Spoiled bitch.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.460
Sofia's bodyguard didn't clear the store

03:13.461 --> 03:14.381
before she went inside.

03:14.382 --> 03:16.363
He may be part of the problem.

03:16.365 --> 03:20.078
Or just inept,
but the way Sofia treats people,

03:20.079 --> 03:22.319
it's no stretch to believe
that someone wants her dead.

03:57.906 --> 04:01.508
I think Sofia's
gonna need a new bodyguard.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.534
Hey, you wanna, get a Danish?

04:10.536 --> 04:11.918
No, thanks.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.653
I caught that gang shooting out in Queens.

04:13.655 --> 04:16.540
How about some Cheetos?

04:21.796 --> 04:25.465
Okay, Fusco, what's up
with you and your box?

04:25.467 --> 04:27.707
I found it in that government
lady Corwin's hotel room.

04:27.708 --> 04:28.602
And here I thought

04:28.604 --> 04:32.506
all the evidence in her case disappeared.

04:32.508 --> 04:33.757
What is that?

04:33.759 --> 04:35.119
It looks like one of those gadgets

04:35.120 --> 04:36.560
the vet used on my kid's labrador,

04:36.562 --> 04:38.695
you know, one of those microchip readers?

04:38.697 --> 04:40.337
Why would Corwin keep something like that

04:40.338 --> 04:42.816
in her hotel room?

04:42.818 --> 04:43.778
As far as I'm concerned,

04:43.779 --> 04:45.339
the only reason we got involved in this

04:45.340 --> 04:47.204
was to get four eyes back,

04:47.206 --> 04:48.822
and he's back.

04:48.824 --> 04:50.490
Why keep digging?

04:50.492 --> 04:53.126
'Cause we're detectives.

04:53.128 --> 04:54.888
Well, the one thing I learned
along the way

04:54.889 --> 04:58.081
is to know when not to ask questions.

04:58.083 --> 05:03.003
You want me to take that
off your hands, Detective?

05:03.005 --> 05:04.387
Trust me on this.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.890
Whatever level these guys are playing at,

05:06.892 --> 05:10.794
we're not there.

05:10.796 --> 05:13.046
All set for your interview,
Mr. Reese?

05:13.048 --> 05:15.348
Just checkin' out the competition.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.983
Good.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.769
The consulate conducted a background check

05:18.771 --> 05:21.772
on your credentials that was strenuous.

05:21.774 --> 05:24.157
Let me guess, you had
to buy another security company.

05:24.159 --> 05:26.142
And a credit bureau.

05:26.144 --> 05:28.962
I will try to make you proud.

05:31.199 --> 05:34.684
John Randall?

05:34.686 --> 05:36.953
I'll need to see your identification.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.542
Oops, wrong one.

05:48.349 --> 05:52.352
Nope, that's his.

05:52.354 --> 05:55.272
Wrong again.

05:55.274 --> 05:57.607
Here we go.

05:57.609 --> 06:00.026
I'm sorry.
I'm...

06:00.028 --> 06:02.362
Show Mr. Randall
to my office.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.948
If these other men can't keep
track of their own wallets,

06:04.950 --> 06:07.150
how can they keep track of my daughter?

06:11.489 --> 06:14.491
Sofia's gone through half
a dozen bodyguards this year,

06:14.493 --> 06:16.209
and no one can keep up with her.

06:16.211 --> 06:17.811
Not even consulate security?

06:17.813 --> 06:19.713
They are Brazilian,

06:19.715 --> 06:22.182
susceptible to political bribery,

06:22.184 --> 06:25.669
spying, feeding gossip to the press.

06:25.671 --> 06:27.537
I want to be clear,
Mr. Randall.

06:27.539 --> 06:30.757
My daughter is the light of my life,

06:30.759 --> 06:33.743
but she's also impossible.

06:33.745 --> 06:35.979
I've handled some difficult assignments.

06:35.981 --> 06:39.683
I can see that.

06:39.685 --> 06:42.002
Guarding convoys in Iraq,

06:42.004 --> 06:43.920
K and R work in Yemen.

06:43.922 --> 06:47.908
But you haven't met my daughter.

06:47.910 --> 06:50.226
Sofia.

06:50.228 --> 06:53.446
Meet a new candidate
for bodyguard position.

06:57.952 --> 07:00.120
No.
Squinty eyes.

07:00.122 --> 07:02.405
He can't be trusted.

07:02.407 --> 07:06.576
Mr. Randall,
you are hired,

07:06.578 --> 07:08.595
but if her privacy is compromised...

07:08.597 --> 07:10.797
I'll fire myself.

07:10.799 --> 07:15.752
My father hired you, but try
to remember you work for me.

07:15.754 --> 07:16.970
Pai, aren't you supposed to be

07:16.972 --> 07:18.388
at dinner with the Russian consul?

07:18.390 --> 07:20.690
But why would anyone

07:20.692 --> 07:23.276
ever expect a Brazilian
to ever be on time?

07:23.278 --> 07:25.111
I thought our reservation
was for 8:00.

07:25.113 --> 07:28.198
Of course you did.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.066
Will you join us, Sofia?

07:30.068 --> 07:31.668
_

07:38.076 --> 07:42.829
This big oaf never realized
he was hired to baby-sit you.

07:42.831 --> 07:45.665
You two should get along splendidly.

07:45.667 --> 07:49.085
Excuse us one second.
Did he agree to meet with me?

07:49.087 --> 07:50.387
It seems Miss Sofia's

07:50.389 --> 07:52.839
a bit more than window dressing,
Mr. Reese.

07:52.841 --> 07:53.957
Yes.

07:53.959 --> 07:56.176
If Hector runs for president,

07:56.178 --> 07:59.312
she could be his best campaign asset,

07:59.314 --> 08:00.981
and she's smart enough to keep

08:00.983 --> 08:03.099
her phone's wi-fi
and bluetooth turned off.

08:03.101 --> 08:05.685
You'll have to get her phone
and activate it manually.

08:05.687 --> 08:07.487
That might be impossible.

08:07.489 --> 08:09.022
It's glued to her thumbs.

08:09.024 --> 08:10.807
Do you care to join us, mi querida?

08:10.809 --> 08:14.310
It seems someone has already
given me a headache, pai.

08:14.312 --> 08:16.463
I'm going to take a bath and go to bed.

08:16.465 --> 08:18.081
Come.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.901
My driver's outside.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.841
Shall I bring the car around?

08:53.951 --> 08:56.319
Finch, there are two men watching us,

08:56.321 --> 08:58.822
and I'm about to introduce myself.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.361
BMW SUV,
356-Charlie.

09:05.363 --> 09:07.881
You know, partial plates
take time to trace.

09:07.883 --> 09:10.050
What's the problem, Finch?

09:10.052 --> 09:13.420
You got somewhere else to be?

09:13.422 --> 09:15.672
No.
No, not really.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.718
Cut it off right here, ladies.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.689
Hi, sweetie.

09:32.691 --> 09:34.557
Sorry, had to wait for my father

09:34.559 --> 09:36.242
to bridge the Cold War with the Russians.

09:36.244 --> 09:37.964
- Who's your friend?
- He's not my friend.

09:37.965 --> 09:39.746
He's my new bodyguard.

09:39.748 --> 09:42.565
Hi, I'm Gabi.
<i>Enchante.</i>

09:42.567 --> 09:44.451
He's cuter than the last one.

09:44.453 --> 09:48.538
He's a pain in the ass.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.457
No way.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.460
I come with, or we both go home,

09:53.462 --> 09:57.630
eat some ice cream while you
teach me the cyrillic alphabet.

09:57.632 --> 09:59.432
Fine,

09:59.434 --> 10:01.267
but you must loosen that tie

10:01.269 --> 10:03.303
and do something about your hair.

10:03.305 --> 10:04.671
What's wrong with my hair?

10:04.673 --> 10:07.924
It's trying too hard.

10:08.726 --> 10:14.731

10:21.123 --> 10:22.989

10:50.301 --> 10:52.819
I'm here to protect, not discipline.

10:52.821 --> 10:55.355
Besides, it's not

Can you see my hand up her skirt?

10:59.477 --> 11:00.860

Hey, man.

11:02.114 --> 11:03.113
What's your problem?

11:03.115 --> 11:04.075
Finch, if this keeps up,

11:04.076 --> 11:05.836
the biggest threat
to Sofia is gonna be me.

11:06.785 --> 11:08.118
Get your damn hands off of me.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.869
What do you think you're doing?

11:21.007 --> 11:24.593
He attacked a harmless man, humiliated me.

11:24.595 --> 11:27.679
We must fire him.

11:27.681 --> 11:29.881
Did anyone photograph
my daughter's behavior?

11:29.883 --> 11:32.884
Absolutely not.

11:32.886 --> 11:35.187
Then you are doing exactly
what I pay you to.

11:35.189 --> 11:36.855
Thank you,
Mr. Randall.

11:36.857 --> 11:39.691
The Japanese energy secretary
will be here at noon.

11:39.693 --> 11:41.943
Your attendance is expected.

11:48.067 --> 11:51.219
Finch, Hector's stepping up
his photo opportunities.

11:51.221 --> 11:52.988
Brazilian news outlets are speculating

11:52.990 --> 11:55.407
that he's preparing
to announce his candidacy.

11:55.409 --> 11:57.459
Which will make Sofia more of a target

11:57.461 --> 11:59.527
than she already is.

11:59.529 --> 12:02.798
Get the car.
We're going shopping.

12:09.373 --> 12:12.774

12:22.719 --> 12:24.319
How are you holding up?

12:24.321 --> 12:26.571
I'm better.
Listen.

12:26.573 --> 12:28.607
I understand that you went out of your way

12:28.609 --> 12:31.076

and I thank you.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.061
No problem.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.573
taken out of JFK yesterday.

12:45.575 --> 12:48.409
Thank you, Detective.

12:50.796 --> 12:53.248
Were you able to obtain Sofia's phone?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.764
My hands are full at the moment.

13:01.591 --> 13:03.525
Sofia, it's almost noon.

13:03.527 --> 13:05.610
One more dress.

13:05.612 --> 13:07.112
You're holding at least five.

13:07.114 --> 13:09.314
Wait here.

13:09.316 --> 13:12.200
What happened to,
"protect, not discipline?"

13:12.202 --> 13:14.035
Sofia happened.

13:26.616 --> 13:27.999
What was that noise, Finch?

13:28.001 --> 13:30.585
What noise?
I didn't hear anything.

13:30.587 --> 13:32.137
We may have a slight problem.

13:32.139 --> 13:34.589
To track Sofia's GPS signal,
I had to access

13:34.591 --> 13:36.174
her provider's cell tower.

13:36.176 --> 13:37.809
Sofia is on the move.

13:37.811 --> 13:41.346
It appears she's given you
the slip, Mr. Reese.

13:41.348 --> 13:44.933
How were you planning
to pay for these, sir?

13:44.935 --> 13:47.185
This should cover it.

13:50.406 --> 13:52.073
She's a block over on 14th Street.

13:57.446 --> 13:59.246
- Just get in the car.
- Got trouble, Finch.

13:59.247 --> 14:03.251
Looks like I'm gonna have to take out...

14:03.253 --> 14:04.619
You're bad.

14:04.621 --> 14:06.141
Sorry about the other night, gorgeous.

14:06.142 --> 14:06.955
Her boyfriend.

14:06.957 --> 14:08.456
Please.
Let me take you to lunch.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.195
I can't, I promised my father

14:10.196 --> 14:11.676
I'd be back at the consulate by noon.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.461
And I promised you bottomless mimosas

14:13.463 --> 14:14.996
at that bistro you love downtown.

14:14.998 --> 14:16.765
You're the one who bailed the other night.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.016
What about tonight?

14:18.018 --> 14:20.719
I promised Gabi a girl's night.

14:20.721 --> 14:22.137
I'm Jack.

14:22.139 --> 14:24.389
You must be the new guy.

14:27.977 --> 14:30.178
I'll call you.

14:32.531 --> 14:34.799
Your father doesn't know
about your boyfriend, does he?

14:34.801 --> 14:37.235
He wouldn't understand,

14:37.237 --> 14:39.971
and you don't either.

14:39.973 --> 14:42.991
One photo opportunity, and you miss it.

14:42.993 --> 14:45.627
The Japanese were insulted.

14:45.629 --> 14:47.412
It was my fault.

14:47.414 --> 14:50.548
We hit traffic.

14:50.550 --> 14:54.252
Make sure you don't run into any traffic

14:54.254 --> 14:55.670
tomorrow night.

14:55.672 --> 14:57.839
Sofia's not to miss a welcoming party

14:57.841 --> 15:00.041
for the Brazilian president.

15:07.149 --> 15:08.900
Thank you.

15:08.902 --> 15:12.720
My father would want me
to date someone less American.

15:12.722 --> 15:15.991
I work for you, remember?

15:37.580 --> 15:41.049
I'm here to check
on that body I called you about.

15:41.051 --> 15:43.468
Corwin, Alicia.
Just give me a minute.

15:43.470 --> 15:44.853
I'll log it in and take you back.

15:44.855 --> 15:47.022
Thanks, Rick.

15:52.144 --> 15:54.362
Agent Snow?

15:58.150 --> 15:59.868
Detective Carter.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.936
Shouldn't sneak up on me like that.

16:01.938 --> 16:03.621
You're looking for John?

16:03.623 --> 16:05.663
I don't think you're gonna
find him in the morgue.

16:05.664 --> 16:06.984
Appreciate the advice, Detective,

16:06.985 --> 16:09.878
but I'm no longer looking for your friend.

16:10.963 --> 16:11.963
I was reassigned.

16:11.965 --> 16:15.300
That's a shame.

16:15.302 --> 16:17.502
It truly is.

16:21.841 --> 16:24.059
You hurt your leg?

16:26.312 --> 16:27.645
Old mistake.

16:27.647 --> 16:30.932
Comes back to haunt me now and then.

16:32.935 --> 16:35.136
You take care now.

16:38.607 --> 16:39.824
Who was that man here to view?

16:39.826 --> 16:43.027
Same case you are, Alicia Corwin.

16:43.029 --> 16:45.280
I need to see that body.

16:47.483 --> 16:49.751
She's been in cold storage for a week.

16:53.539 --> 16:55.540
2-inch incision
on her upper arm.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.726
Is that standard autopsy procedure?

16:57.728 --> 16:59.177
Nope, it's not.

16:59.179 --> 17:01.750
No swelling, no clotting,
and no record of it

17:01.751 --> 17:03.831
in the ME's report,
which means it must've happened

17:03.833 --> 17:06.217
after the autopsy was performed.

17:06.219 --> 17:07.383
You memorize the report,

17:07.384 --> 17:09.304
or you just know that
off the top of your head?

17:09.306 --> 17:11.106
No, but your friend who was just here,

17:11.108 --> 17:15.175
he asked me the very same question.

17:19.515 --> 17:21.348
I was able to hack the rental car company

17:21.351 --> 17:23.067
that your visitors used.

17:23.069 --> 17:26.134
The BMW was rented to a Gustavo Lira,

17:26.135 --> 17:27.655
a private investigator from Sao Paulo.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.128
Sofia's calling Gabi.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.379
Hey.

17:34.381 --> 17:36.831
Are you okay?
You sound distracted.

17:36.833 --> 17:39.233
Something's happened to that
guy Paul from the other night.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.835
- Paul.
- Look, I can't talk right now.

17:40.836 --> 17:43.371
I'll tell you tonight at the club.

17:45.707 --> 17:48.743
No Paul in Sofia's contacts.

17:48.745 --> 17:50.812
I'll try to figure out
who she's talkin' about.

17:50.814 --> 17:52.430
Anyone else we should be looking at?

17:52.432 --> 17:54.232
Well, we know that Hector doesn't approve

17:54.234 --> 17:57.085
of Sofia's boyfriend Jack.

17:57.087 --> 17:58.436
Hector's political party

17:58.438 --> 18:01.406
stresses socioeconomic equality for all.

18:01.408 --> 18:03.408
While his own daughter runs around town

18:03.410 --> 18:05.610
with a trust fund kid.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.781
I'm going clubbing.

18:09.783 --> 18:13.001
Thought I'd use the front door
for a change.

18:13.003 --> 18:15.203
Excellent choice.

18:26.783 --> 18:29.300
Gabi's not responding to Sofia's texts,

18:29.302 --> 18:30.885
and she said she couldn't talk earlier.

18:30.887 --> 18:33.471
Maybe she had company.

18:33.473 --> 18:36.391
So do we.

18:36.393 --> 18:38.643
Same guys from before.

18:41.447 --> 18:43.731
Finch, I may have a problem.

18:48.770 --> 18:51.322
Gustavo Lira isn't an assassin, Finch.

18:51.324 --> 18:53.958
He's a paparazzo.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.943
- Hey, give me that back.
- What are you doing?

18:55.945 --> 18:57.579
Your father said no pictures.

18:57.581 --> 18:59.447
Hey!

19:14.397 --> 19:15.847
Hello?

19:15.849 --> 19:19.350
Yeah, Detective Carter from NYPD Homicide.

19:19.352 --> 19:21.152
I was looking for an Agent Mark Snow.

19:21.154 --> 19:23.471
Is this his cell?

19:26.743 --> 19:29.244
Hello?

19:30.864 --> 19:33.748
Detective Carter, have you
had contact with Agent Snow?

19:33.750 --> 19:36.367
Yeah, I saw him yesterday.

19:36.369 --> 19:39.921
Where did this sighting take place?

19:39.923 --> 19:42.590
Who am I speaking with?

19:42.592 --> 19:44.792
We'll be in touch.

20:15.157 --> 20:17.542
Gabi's not here, Finch.

20:17.544 --> 20:19.544
She was supposed
to meet Sofia an hour ago.

20:19.546 --> 20:21.746
Something's not right.

20:28.137 --> 20:29.497
Finch, I think I found our threat,

20:29.498 --> 20:30.972
and they're not photographers.

20:30.974 --> 20:32.840
How can you tell?

20:32.842 --> 20:34.258
The gun was a pretty good hint.

21:06.074 --> 21:08.292
My God, what's going on?

21:14.950 --> 21:17.185
Had enough fun for one night?

21:28.331 --> 21:31.166
Got the pictures you sent.

21:31.168 --> 21:33.368
Just so happens these men
fit the description

21:33.370 --> 21:35.003
of some guys who got their asses kicked

21:35.005 --> 21:37.322
at Club 225 tonight.

21:37.324 --> 21:40.425
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

21:40.427 --> 21:42.094
Not my scene.

21:42.096 --> 21:44.216
Did you notice the scars
on the back of their necks?

21:44.217 --> 21:47.132
Branding. Some gangs
use it as an initiation.

21:47.134 --> 21:50.385
I'll try to find out which one
uses this particular scar.

21:54.974 --> 21:56.942
Moqueca de ovos.

21:56.944 --> 21:59.611
My favorite.

21:59.613 --> 22:01.196
How did you know?

22:01.198 --> 22:05.017
An inside source.

22:05.019 --> 22:07.419
If you hadn't been there tonight...

22:07.421 --> 22:10.355
Did you recognize any of the
other men over there tonight?

22:10.357 --> 22:11.523
I've never seen them.

22:11.525 --> 22:13.859
Friends of Gabi's, maybe.

22:13.861 --> 22:15.193
God.
Gabi.

22:15.195 --> 22:17.079
She was supposed to meet me tonight.

22:17.081 --> 22:19.081
- The shooting, I...
- I looked.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.300
She wasn't there.

22:21.302 --> 22:23.285
Gabi wanted to talk about this Paul.

22:23.287 --> 22:24.536
Who is he?

22:24.538 --> 22:27.055
Paul Romano, I think.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.891
We partied with him Saturday.

22:28.893 --> 22:30.792
- Where?
- At first, the club.

22:30.794 --> 22:33.428
Jack went home.
He wasn't feeling well.

22:33.430 --> 22:35.013
I was angry with him for leaving,

22:35.015 --> 22:38.433
so when Paul invited us back
to the penthouse,

22:38.435 --> 22:40.852
Gabi and I went,

22:40.854 --> 22:44.106
but nothing happened between Paul and me.

22:51.581 --> 22:53.615
I found Paul Romano.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.457
Failed club promoter
with a couple of arrests

22:55.458 --> 22:56.868
for selling designer drugs.

22:56.870 --> 22:59.087
What does a small-time
drug dealer in New York

22:59.089 --> 23:01.590
have to do with
a Brazilian election, Finch?

23:01.592 --> 23:03.546
Maybe nothing.
I'm not sure

23:03.547 --> 23:05.627
her father's politics
have gotten her into trouble.

23:05.629 --> 23:07.763
I'm beginning to think that Sofia's choice

23:07.765 --> 23:09.631
of drinking companions has.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.917
I wanna talk to this Paul Romano.

23:14.988 --> 23:16.955
It could prove challenging.

23:16.957 --> 23:20.925
Paul Romano jumped out of his
penthouse late Saturday night.

23:20.927 --> 23:23.595
NYPD's calling it suicide.

23:23.597 --> 23:24.813
Sofia, was there anyone else

23:24.815 --> 23:27.616
in the penthouse with you that night?

23:27.618 --> 23:30.152
Me, Gabi, Paul.

23:30.154 --> 23:32.103
Then this guy showed up.
He was...

23:32.105 --> 23:33.956
things got weird, tense,

23:33.958 --> 23:35.574
so Gabi and I got out of there.

23:35.576 --> 23:38.660
Can you describe
this other guy who was there?

23:38.662 --> 23:41.946
Gabi took a video on my phone.

23:43.282 --> 23:46.802
Say it in Russian.

23:46.804 --> 23:49.087
Now Italian.

23:51.591 --> 23:53.431
That's one of our friends
from the nightclub.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.645
You think Paul
had something to do with this?

23:56.647 --> 23:58.397
Unlikely.

23:58.399 --> 24:00.515
Paul's dead.

24:00.517 --> 24:01.900
Police think he committed suicide

24:01.902 --> 24:03.468
the same night that you were with him.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.520
If Paul committed suicide,

24:05.522 --> 24:07.889
then why would those men be after me?

24:07.891 --> 24:09.858
If he committed suicide,

24:09.860 --> 24:12.110
they wouldn't be.

24:12.112 --> 24:14.997
You can place this guy at the scene.

24:14.999 --> 24:18.483
Not just me.
Gabi.

24:18.485 --> 24:20.502
I need to find her.
She might be in danger too.

24:20.504 --> 24:22.838
I'll call a friend on the
police force to check on her.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.440
They'll be able to track her cell phone.

24:24.441 --> 24:25.624
We need to find her now.

24:25.626 --> 24:27.175
No, you need to stay here.

24:27.177 --> 24:28.510
Someone just tried to kill you.

24:28.512 --> 24:29.928
She's my friend.
I'm going.

24:29.930 --> 24:32.514
You can't stop me.

24:32.516 --> 24:36.385
Okay, but when we get there,
you stay in the car.

25:14.091 --> 25:16.374
- Carter.
- Detective, is this a bad time?

25:16.376 --> 25:19.878
No.
I, I just ran into someone

25:19.880 --> 25:22.397
I hadn't seen in a while.

25:22.399 --> 25:25.100
I ID'd the branding
on those bangers from Club 225.

25:25.102 --> 25:26.651
They're 14th Street mafia.

25:26.653 --> 25:28.019
Thank you, Detective.

25:28.021 --> 25:30.822
Now, if you could just check your email...

25:34.277 --> 25:36.111
You recognize the man on the right?

25:36.113 --> 25:38.530
Paul Romano.
Designer drug peddler

25:38.532 --> 25:41.399
who allegedly committed suicide
four nights ago.

25:41.401 --> 25:43.085
You don't sound convinced.

25:43.087 --> 25:46.070
The penthouse cameras were
conveniently malfunctioning.

25:46.072 --> 25:48.423
The other guy was with Paul
before he jumped.

25:48.425 --> 25:50.959
- Do you recognize him?
- No.

25:50.961 --> 25:54.463
But that branding he's got means
he's 14th Street mafia too.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.047
I'll work on getting a new name.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.216
Also, we need you to track a cell phone,

25:58.218 --> 26:00.635
a girl who may know something
about Paul's murder

26:00.637 --> 26:02.637
and who may be in trouble.

26:02.639 --> 26:04.890
I'll take care of it.

26:12.782 --> 26:14.065
Would you like to go for a walk?

26:15.803 --> 26:17.569
Well, let's get a leash.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.790
I suppose you'll want some treats.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.139
Carter, tell me you found Gabi.

26:55.141 --> 26:57.359
She never came home last night.

26:57.361 --> 26:59.310
Tracked her cell to 31st and 1st,

26:59.312 --> 27:02.247
so I came down to find her.

27:02.249 --> 27:03.665
Gabi's here.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.867
Great.
We're on our way.

27:05.869 --> 27:07.986
That's not a good idea, John.

27:07.988 --> 27:10.372
I recognized the address
as soon as it came up.

27:10.374 --> 27:12.874
31st and 1st is the city morgue.

27:12.876 --> 27:16.962
Couple uniforms found her body downtown.

27:16.964 --> 27:19.163
I'm sorry.

27:43.883 --> 27:46.334
Sofia wanted some air.

27:46.336 --> 27:47.686
I took her to the only place

27:47.688 --> 27:49.471
in the city you can actually find any.

27:49.473 --> 27:51.006
How is she taking the news?

27:51.008 --> 27:53.008
About as well as can be expected.

27:53.010 --> 27:56.228
Her best friend was murdered,
and she blames herself.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.562
Listen, Finch,

27:57.564 --> 28:01.032
I need you to come keep an eye on Sofia.

28:01.034 --> 28:02.701
She's not safe

28:02.703 --> 28:06.187
with me if I'm out looking
for Gabi's killer.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.406
Not a problem.
I'll be there shortly.

28:27.927 --> 28:30.095
So we'll just...

28:30.097 --> 28:31.346
we'll just go outside.

29:19.530 --> 29:21.897
Mr. Reese,

29:21.899 --> 29:24.733
I seem to be having a bit
of a complication.

29:24.735 --> 29:27.602
I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you.

29:27.604 --> 29:30.271
No problem, Harold.

29:30.273 --> 29:31.773
I'll call Fusco.

29:31.775 --> 29:35.710
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

29:40.449 --> 29:43.952
I can't go back to the consulate.

29:43.954 --> 29:47.556
My father, he'll make me play host

29:47.558 --> 29:49.474
to the Brazilian president.

29:49.476 --> 29:51.509
I should be out there finding the bastard

29:51.511 --> 29:53.061
who killed my friend.

29:53.063 --> 29:56.130
That's for the police, Sofia,

29:56.132 --> 29:58.483
not you.

29:58.485 --> 30:03.355
You know, that night, Gabi
didn't even want to come out.

30:03.357 --> 30:06.140
She came out because I said we had to.

30:06.142 --> 30:08.493
We just had to.

30:08.495 --> 30:11.162
It's not your fault.

30:11.164 --> 30:13.044
You were at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

30:13.045 --> 30:17.035
They're all the wrong places.

30:17.037 --> 30:22.007
I've been lost for so long.

30:22.009 --> 30:24.042
I thought maybe if I kept looking,

30:24.044 --> 30:28.263
I might find somewhere
that made me feel happy.

30:28.265 --> 30:30.498
I never thought anyone would get hurt.

30:34.553 --> 30:38.139
I've spent some time feeling lost.

30:38.141 --> 30:39.975
What changed?

30:39.977 --> 30:41.943
Someone found me,

30:41.945 --> 30:44.479
told me I needed a purpose.

30:44.481 --> 30:48.400
Sounds like a good friend.

30:48.402 --> 30:49.751
He is.

30:49.753 --> 30:54.022
Come on.

30:56.909 --> 30:58.610
Detective Fusco will be looking after you

30:58.612 --> 31:01.846
at your father's party tonight, Sofia.

31:03.749 --> 31:07.218
Yeah.

31:07.220 --> 31:08.720
I get it.

31:08.722 --> 31:10.555
I'm not as tall as him, maybe not as fast.

31:10.557 --> 31:12.197
Go ahead, make fun of me.
I can take it.

31:12.198 --> 31:14.142
You look like my uncle Jacobo.

31:14.144 --> 31:15.727
We call him the <i>garanhao.</i>

31:15.729 --> 31:17.095
What's that supposed to mean?

31:17.097 --> 31:20.348
Stud. He has great luck
with the ladies.

31:22.935 --> 31:24.552
Don't let her out of your sight.

31:24.554 --> 31:26.821
What's this, my first trip to the rodeo?

31:31.160 --> 31:33.345
So you like falafel?

31:36.282 --> 31:37.999
I got an ID on your mystery man

31:38.001 --> 31:39.501
from the video.

31:39.503 --> 31:43.121
Gang unit ID'd
Montgomery Spencer, AKA Monty.

31:43.123 --> 31:45.540
Record for assault
and possession with intent.

31:45.542 --> 31:47.208
What's his connection to Paul Romano?

31:47.210 --> 31:48.910
That's what doesn't check out for me.

31:48.912 --> 31:50.211
Up until six months ago,

31:50.213 --> 31:52.130
Romano was selling small amounts

31:52.132 --> 31:54.132
of club drugs to his friends,

31:54.134 --> 31:55.967
but word is Paul started moving

31:55.969 --> 31:58.103
huge quantities of designer drugs.

31:58.105 --> 32:01.589
Maybe if Monty was his supplier,

32:01.591 --> 32:04.476
Paul tried to renegotiate his end.

32:04.478 --> 32:05.694
I'd say the negotiations

32:05.696 --> 32:07.428
- didn't go his way.
- Maybe.

32:07.430 --> 32:09.197
I still don't understand how these two

32:09.199 --> 32:12.117
wind up in bed together.

32:12.119 --> 32:14.619
Monty might have had the hookup
to the supplier,

32:14.621 --> 32:16.905
and Romano the client base,

32:16.907 --> 32:18.907
but neither of them
had the money to bankroll it.

32:18.909 --> 32:21.609
So they had a silent partner.

32:21.611 --> 32:24.262
I don't know, but I got an address

32:24.263 --> 32:25.663
to the bar where Monty and his pals

32:25.665 --> 32:27.615
like to spend some time in.

32:27.617 --> 32:29.417
Figured we'd go and ask him in person.

32:29.419 --> 32:32.137
Thanks, Carter.

32:38.428 --> 32:41.462
Isn't that your daughter?

32:41.464 --> 32:45.316
Sofia, where have you been?

32:45.318 --> 32:46.401
Is everything okay?

32:46.403 --> 32:47.519
It's okay.
I just...

32:47.521 --> 32:49.020
Come.

32:49.022 --> 32:50.862
An old friend from Brazil
wants to say hello.

32:50.863 --> 32:52.490
- This is my daughter, Sofia.
- Hi.

32:52.492 --> 32:55.224
_

32:55.225 --> 32:56.945
You know, you don't write.
You don't call.

32:56.947 --> 32:58.830
I mean, I'm a big guy, but I am sensitive.

32:58.832 --> 33:00.832
It's good to talk to you too, Detective.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.984
Is our friend safe?

33:02.986 --> 33:05.537
A target-rich environment.
Lots of people.

33:05.539 --> 33:09.281
That's why I've accessed
the museum's security cameras,

33:09.282 --> 33:11.042
and having seen the kitchen,
I'd advise you

33:11.044 --> 33:15.764
to stay away from the shrimp puffs.

33:30.196 --> 33:33.948
- Why don't you wait in the car?
- Why don't you wait in the car?

33:33.950 --> 33:35.867
- Give me 3 1/2 minutes.
- Please.

33:35.869 --> 33:37.635
There are at least ten guys in there.

33:37.637 --> 33:39.854
Okay, four minutes.

33:55.272 --> 33:57.538
Thank you for the fine hospitality

33:57.540 --> 34:00.341
you have shown my country's
distinguished president.

34:00.343 --> 34:03.895
Since he is here, I think
it's time to announce

34:03.897 --> 34:06.064
that I will be running
for the Brazilian presidency

34:06.066 --> 34:07.482
this year.

34:20.913 --> 34:22.496
You okay?

34:22.498 --> 34:25.733
I just want a moment alone.

34:32.174 --> 34:34.375
I'll be right
on the other side of this door.

34:45.638 --> 34:48.188
Sorry, I'm at the party.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.357
Come meet me.

34:49.359 --> 34:51.442
I don't know.

34:51.444 --> 34:53.862
You promised me tonight.

34:53.864 --> 34:56.614
I-I don't know
if I can get out.

34:56.616 --> 34:57.899
You don't have to.

34:57.901 --> 35:00.101
I'm right outside.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.005
I got bored sitting in the car,

35:21.007 --> 35:23.591
and it took you longer than four minutes.

35:23.593 --> 35:26.460
Well, this guy hit me
over the head with a neon sign.

35:26.462 --> 35:28.182
Not very sportsmanlike,

35:28.183 --> 35:29.463
and none of them want to tell me

35:29.465 --> 35:31.149
where to find their pal Monty.

35:31.151 --> 35:32.934
Yeah, that's why you should ask them

35:32.936 --> 35:35.186
before you knock them out, John.

35:38.107 --> 35:40.191
Mr. Reese,
there was another man

35:40.193 --> 35:42.193
at Paul Romano's penthouse that night,

35:42.195 --> 35:43.945
Sofia's boyfriend Jack Hughes.

35:43.947 --> 35:44.946
He's the bankroller.

35:44.948 --> 35:46.948
Fusco's with Sofia.

35:46.950 --> 35:48.032
Let him know.

35:48.034 --> 35:49.584
Detective Fusco?

35:49.586 --> 35:50.868
Where is Sofia?

35:50.870 --> 35:52.203
Powdering her nose.

35:52.205 --> 35:53.871
No, she isn't.

35:53.873 --> 35:57.041
I'm afraid you're
in the wrong place, Mr. Reese.

36:00.714 --> 36:03.497
Taxi!

36:03.499 --> 36:05.049
I'm really sorry about this, babe.

36:05.051 --> 36:06.551
Sorry?

36:06.553 --> 36:08.753
I don't understand.

36:31.053 --> 36:32.854
Sorry, babe.

36:32.856 --> 36:34.338
Why?

36:34.340 --> 36:35.807
Times are tough.

36:35.809 --> 36:38.176
I ran through my trust fund
and needed money.

36:38.178 --> 36:40.061
Monty had the product.

36:40.063 --> 36:41.679
I hooked him up with Paul to move it,

36:41.681 --> 36:44.032
but Paul got greedy.

36:44.034 --> 36:45.567
You had Paul killed.

36:45.569 --> 36:48.686
No, Monty gave Paul a choice...

36:48.688 --> 36:51.406
give us the money, or go out the window.

36:51.408 --> 36:53.575
Did Monty give you a choice?

36:53.577 --> 36:55.543
You or me?

36:55.545 --> 36:57.662
Something like that.

36:57.664 --> 36:59.697
Sorry, baby.

36:59.699 --> 37:02.967
You're just a beautiful loose end.

37:06.071 --> 37:08.372
Give me your phone,

37:08.374 --> 37:10.558
now.

37:20.686 --> 37:24.189
Say it in Russian.

37:24.191 --> 37:25.690
Now Italian.

37:25.692 --> 37:27.942
Did you send or show this to anyone?

37:31.197 --> 37:33.397
Good.

37:35.784 --> 37:38.169
Okay, bozo, show's over.

37:38.171 --> 37:40.788
Come on, darling.
Get out of the car.

37:42.424 --> 37:45.543
I'm just gonna find her again
after I shoot you.

37:54.637 --> 37:56.938
Are you kidding?

37:56.940 --> 37:58.389
Look at you.

37:58.391 --> 38:00.441
What do you think, you're gonna outrun me?

38:00.443 --> 38:02.694
Let me mull that over a sec.

38:13.405 --> 38:16.624
Yep, I'm pretty sure I can outrun ya.

38:17.493 --> 38:19.544
Thanks, Carter.

38:19.546 --> 38:22.780
Are you hurt?

38:25.284 --> 38:26.584
I'm fine.

38:26.586 --> 38:28.452
Did you find Jack?

38:28.454 --> 38:29.954
Not yet.

38:29.956 --> 38:31.639
The 11:00 flight.

38:31.641 --> 38:33.891
To the Caymans, that's right.

38:35.627 --> 38:37.595
God!

38:37.597 --> 38:39.347
Okay, it was Monty.
I swear.

38:39.349 --> 38:40.932
He's unleashed, okay?

38:40.934 --> 38:42.113
He was the one who wanted

38:42.114 --> 38:43.434
to tie up the loose ends, not me.

38:43.436 --> 38:45.303
Paul was never even supposed to die.

38:46.639 --> 38:48.673
Please.
What do you want from me?

38:48.675 --> 38:50.608
Is this a shakedown?

38:50.610 --> 38:53.477
No.
This is a breakup.

38:53.479 --> 38:57.615
Sofia, should I drop him?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.485
My God!

39:01.487 --> 39:04.255
Not yet.

39:04.257 --> 39:06.424
You killed my only friend.

39:06.426 --> 39:08.159
That was so not my idea, baby.

39:08.161 --> 39:10.661
Just like selling me out
to Monty wasn't your idea?

39:10.663 --> 39:12.180
I told you he gave me a choice,

39:12.182 --> 39:13.548
you or me.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.800
You have him.
I knew you'd be okay.

39:15.802 --> 39:21.356
I will be okay.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.207
- Thank you.
- No problem.

39:39.209 --> 39:42.160
Have you thought
about what you'll do next?

39:42.162 --> 39:45.213
I will be returning
to Brazil with my father

39:45.215 --> 39:46.547
for the election.

39:46.549 --> 39:49.700
Guess I can't talk you into relocating?

39:49.702 --> 39:52.136
New York's my home...

39:52.138 --> 39:56.591
for now.

39:56.593 --> 39:59.010
You've taken very good care of me.

40:06.653 --> 40:09.537
Night.

40:09.539 --> 40:11.406
Detective Carter, did you call the CIA

40:11.408 --> 40:16.027
regarding Mark Snow?

40:16.029 --> 40:18.663
I called his cell, yes.

40:18.665 --> 40:20.865
You had contact with Mark Snow.

40:20.867 --> 40:23.751
Last I checked,
Snow was yours to keep tabs on,

40:23.753 --> 40:25.403
not mine.

40:25.405 --> 40:27.872
You lose him?

40:27.874 --> 40:29.624
I'd say talk to his partner Evans,

40:29.626 --> 40:35.513
except the guy was found dead
in a hotel five weeks ago.

40:35.515 --> 40:38.082
Think I've done enough
of your job for you.

40:38.084 --> 40:39.851
Now, if you'll excuse me.

40:54.868 --> 40:57.118
Took a preliminary look at it.

40:59.121 --> 41:00.655
I think we have a big problem.

of that, Mark.

41:26.382 --> 41:27.915
I mean, you thought I was dead too.

41:27.917 --> 41:32.803
Always been a bit of an optimist.

41:32.805 --> 41:34.365
You wanna know who told her to send you

41:34.366 --> 41:35.940
and your pal Reese to China,

41:35.942 --> 41:40.311
you'll have to ask her really loudly.

41:40.313 --> 41:42.330
Shame.

41:42.332 --> 41:47.618
Guess you'll have to run
a few more errands for me.

41:51.157 --> 41:54.091
I gotta tell ya, our line of work,

41:54.093 --> 41:56.794
you meet a lot of disturbed people,

41:56.796 --> 41:58.262
but you, Kara?

41:58.264 --> 42:01.499
You were always
in a class all by yourself.

42:04.053 --> 42:06.554
Be careful.
