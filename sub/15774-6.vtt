00:12.280 --> 00:14.024
Ahh!

00:18.235 --> 00:20.002
Ohh. Well, that was fun.

00:20.036 --> 00:21.637
Good match.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.305
Whoops.
Almost slipped there.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.532
Got to be careful.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.546
Whoa! Oof.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.647
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

00:53.681 --> 00:54.883
I was so starving.

00:54.918 --> 00:56.830
Playing tennis really
works up an appetite.

00:56.950 --> 00:57.956
I wouldn't know.

00:58.084 --> 00:59.118
Hey, you two.

00:59.152 --> 01:02.257
- Oh, hi, mom.
- Hi, Patricia.

01:03.508 --> 01:05.274
Lola, don't forget,

01:05.309 --> 01:07.309
I booked us for a pedicure
at 1:00.

01:07.377 --> 01:08.634
Ooh, we better go.

01:10.379 --> 01:13.047
Mmm. Mmm.
Sorry, tennis.

01:13.082 --> 01:14.949
Gotta fuel the machine.

01:15.017 --> 01:16.019
Bye, dad.

01:16.139 --> 01:17.207
Have fun.

01:18.132 --> 01:19.665
Bugs.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.827
Hey, Walter.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.561
Enjoying your little lunch?

01:22.596 --> 01:24.562
Lola and I were playing tennis.

01:24.596 --> 01:25.462
Well, she was.

01:25.497 --> 01:29.400
Tennis. I didn't know
you played tennis.

01:29.434 --> 01:30.268
I love tennis.

01:30.302 --> 01:31.436
How would you like to play

01:31.471 --> 01:33.204
in the tennis tournament
held right here

01:33.239 --> 01:36.348
at the Royal Oaks Glen Oaks
Oakwood Oaks Country Club?

01:36.468 --> 01:38.644
A tennis tournament?
That'd be great.

01:38.678 --> 01:39.845
Well, then it's settled.

01:39.879 --> 01:43.516
We'll enter the father son
tennis tournament.

01:43.550 --> 01:44.417
Father son?

01:44.451 --> 01:47.053
Walter, I'm not your son.

01:47.088 --> 01:52.092
Oh, Bugs, you really know
how to wound an old man.

01:52.126 --> 01:54.195
I think of you as my son,

01:54.229 --> 01:56.731
ergo you are my son.

01:56.765 --> 01:57.832
What do you say?

01:57.866 --> 02:00.535
Hmm. Getting to hit
the ball to someone

02:00.569 --> 02:03.139
and having them actually hit it back.

02:03.173 --> 02:04.474
Let's do it.

02:04.508 --> 02:07.243
Wonderful!

02:08.979 --> 02:11.880
Got to fuel the machine.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.982
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

02:27.127 --> 02:30.428
Oh, good, you're awake.
Let's go.

02:30.463 --> 02:32.930
What? It's 4:00
in the morning.

02:32.965 --> 02:34.165
We've got to start training.

02:34.199 --> 02:37.702
The father son tennis tournament
is in a few weeks.

02:37.736 --> 02:41.071
I gotta say, I like your enthusiasm.

02:41.105 --> 02:42.171
What's up?

02:42.206 --> 02:44.173
Are you just getting home?

02:44.207 --> 02:45.340
Yeah.

02:45.375 --> 02:46.675
Where were you?

02:46.709 --> 02:47.342
Out.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.676
What's in the bag?

02:48.711 --> 02:51.513
Stuff.

02:55.785 --> 02:58.287
Well, training awaits.

02:58.321 --> 03:02.357
How is this training for the
father son tennis tournament?

03:02.392 --> 03:04.326
There's two parts to the tournament.

03:04.361 --> 03:05.594
Sure, there's the tennis part,

03:05.629 --> 03:09.298
but what I think we need to focus
on is the father son part.

03:09.332 --> 03:11.968
If we don't first bond
as father and son,

03:12.002 --> 03:15.639
then how will we bond
on the tennis court?

03:25.150 --> 03:26.450
Whoops. Ha ha.

03:26.485 --> 03:28.385
Well, we'll just share.

03:28.453 --> 03:30.321
Oh, would you look at us?

03:30.355 --> 03:33.257
We're bonding.

03:37.296 --> 03:39.998
What's in the bag?

03:40.032 --> 03:42.267
Stuff.

03:42.301 --> 03:43.335
I should get going.

03:43.369 --> 03:45.236
I've got to pick up my kid.

03:45.271 --> 03:47.505
Pfft!
You have a kid?

03:47.539 --> 03:50.375
He's not my actual kid.

03:50.409 --> 03:51.309
I'm just his mentor.

03:51.376 --> 03:53.811
I joined the father figure program.

03:53.845 --> 03:55.813
What's the father figure program?

03:55.848 --> 03:56.915
It's a program for kids

03:56.949 --> 04:00.285
who need positive male
role models in their lives.

04:00.319 --> 04:01.486
What do you have to do?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.154
You take them to fun places.

04:03.189 --> 04:04.689
Out to lunch, to the movies.

04:04.724 --> 04:06.524
Sometimes you take them shopping.

04:06.559 --> 04:08.860
You should join
the father figure program.

04:08.895 --> 04:12.330
Hmm. Seems kind of
time consuming.

04:12.365 --> 04:13.398
But maybe it'd be good.

04:13.432 --> 04:16.301
It's supposed to be very rewarding.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.935
Huh. I'll do it.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.438
Wow. I'm impressed.

04:20.473 --> 04:22.674
I'm not always
the self-centered jerk

04:22.709 --> 04:24.476
that people think I am.

04:24.510 --> 04:27.679
Well, I better go.

04:28.882 --> 04:31.551
What does that have to do with me?

04:33.954 --> 04:37.757
Ahh! Ahh! Ooh!

04:41.028 --> 04:44.130
I just want to say I'm so excited
to be your father figure.

04:44.165 --> 04:49.036
I want you to know that I take this
responsibility very seriously.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.904
I want to make
a difference in your life

04:50.938 --> 04:56.276
because I know you're about
to make a difference in mine.

04:56.310 --> 04:58.110
Listen, piggy.

04:58.145 --> 04:59.111
I go through father figures

04:59.146 --> 05:01.013
like you go through
boxes of chocolates.

05:02.015 --> 05:03.049
I may look small,

05:03.083 --> 05:04.483
but I can take care of myself.

05:04.518 --> 05:07.186
So let's just make this
easy for both of us

05:07.221 --> 05:10.356
and walk away before anyone gets hurt.

05:10.391 --> 05:12.959
And by anyone, I mean you.

05:12.994 --> 05:15.829
Now, now, Henry,
I'm not going anywhere.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.831
I'm committed to this program.

05:17.865 --> 05:19.232
I'm committed to you.

05:19.267 --> 05:21.601
Now, let's get to know each other.

05:21.636 --> 05:24.639
I understand you're 7 years old.

05:24.673 --> 05:26.440
7 and a half.

05:26.475 --> 05:28.909
How old are you, 90?

05:28.943 --> 05:30.077
What?

05:30.111 --> 05:30.878
Ha ha. No.

05:30.912 --> 05:33.414
How come your skin is so stretchy?

05:33.448 --> 05:35.182
I didn't know it was.

05:35.216 --> 05:36.683
Why do you wear that outfit?

05:36.718 --> 05:37.684
What are you, a waiter?

05:37.719 --> 05:40.153
Actually, I'm a caterer.

05:40.188 --> 05:42.723
Then make me some chicken.

05:42.757 --> 05:43.524
Pardon?

05:43.558 --> 05:45.892
I said make me some chicken.

05:45.927 --> 05:50.396
Henry, first of all, you need
to learn how to say please.

05:50.431 --> 05:54.099
And second of all,
I packed us a picnic lunch.

05:54.134 --> 05:55.367
Ooh, is it chicken?

05:55.401 --> 05:57.169
No, peanut butter and jelly.

05:57.203 --> 06:01.438
And I might have put a couple
boxes of chocolates in there.

06:01.473 --> 06:04.108
Well, can we get chicken afterwards?

06:04.176 --> 06:05.142
No.

06:05.176 --> 06:07.377
After our picnic, we're
gonna do something fun.

06:07.412 --> 06:09.947
Have you ever been
to the textile museum?

06:09.981 --> 06:14.385
They have an exhibit
on early American tablecloths.

06:19.125 --> 06:24.630
Or, um, we could do something else.

06:24.664 --> 06:26.565
What do you want to do?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.067
I'm a chicken hawk.

06:28.101 --> 06:29.235
I want chicken.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.471
Enough with the chicken.

06:31.505 --> 06:32.639
I'm your father figure,

06:32.673 --> 06:34.641
and I say we're going
to the textile museum

06:34.675 --> 06:40.047
and we're gonna see what those
early Americans ate dinner on.

06:40.082 --> 06:42.584
Henry!

06:51.627 --> 06:53.061
See you later, piggy.

06:53.095 --> 06:54.963
I'm gonna find some...

06:54.997 --> 06:58.467
Uhh.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.870
I've always dreamed
of this--

07:01.904 --> 07:06.774
tossing the baseball
around with my son.

07:06.809 --> 07:08.576
Oh!

07:08.610 --> 07:09.777
You know, Walter,

07:09.811 --> 07:11.245
the tournament is
right around the corner.

07:11.279 --> 07:15.148
And it is a tennis tournament,
not a baseball tournament.

07:15.182 --> 07:17.983
Don't you think we should
play tennis at some point?

07:18.018 --> 07:21.620
Oh, Bugs, you're nothing
if you're not practical.

07:21.654 --> 07:24.856
You must get that from
Patricia's side of the family.

07:24.891 --> 07:28.426
My side, we're all dreamers.

07:28.494 --> 07:30.962
Go long!

07:33.966 --> 07:35.600
Touchdown!

07:35.634 --> 07:36.434
Ha ha ha!

07:36.468 --> 07:39.237
Oh, that's my boy.

07:44.844 --> 07:45.978
What are you doing?

07:46.012 --> 07:48.347
I joined the father figure program.

07:48.381 --> 07:49.782
Wow, I'm impressed.

07:49.816 --> 07:53.619
A little surprised that they would
let you be a father figure.

07:53.653 --> 07:55.587
Oh, I'm not the father figure.

07:55.621 --> 07:57.789
I'm getting a father figure.

07:57.824 --> 07:59.658
Yeah, that makes more sense.

07:59.692 --> 08:01.460
I'm the one who needs the mentor.

08:01.494 --> 08:03.228
You saw me sauntering
home at 4:00 am.

08:03.263 --> 08:05.898
Heaven knows where I was
or what I was doing.

08:05.932 --> 08:07.633
I'm out of control, man.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.167
I need guidance.

08:10.270 --> 08:14.239
Oh, that must be my father figure now.

08:18.645 --> 08:22.981
Eh, I don't want to know.

08:25.818 --> 08:26.852
Ooh, limo.

08:26.886 --> 08:28.687
So far so good.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.218
Daffy Duck?

08:31.527 --> 08:34.192
Big fat rooster?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.049
In all the time I say, I all the time

08:43.212 --> 08:43.991
I've known you,

08:44.070 --> 08:46.861
I had no idea you were a child.

08:46.981 --> 08:48.708
Oh. Uh, actually--

08:48.742 --> 08:50.910
That makes you--
I say, that makes you

08:50.944 --> 08:52.545
all the more impressive.

08:52.580 --> 08:56.683
Well, I've always felt
I was wise beyond my years.

08:56.751 --> 08:58.786
Can I have one of these waters?

08:58.820 --> 09:01.455
You can have anything you'd like, boy.

09:01.489 --> 09:04.592
Can I have four of these waters?

09:04.626 --> 09:06.860
Heh heh heh.

09:06.895 --> 09:07.928
Heh heh heh.

09:07.963 --> 09:10.731
Mr. Leghorn, this is
the same idiot

09:10.765 --> 09:13.300
who ruined your movie
and destroyed your company.

09:13.334 --> 09:16.203
That's precisely why
he needs a father figure.

09:16.237 --> 09:19.739
And why you need to mind
your own business, Carol.

09:19.774 --> 09:24.343
So tell me, son, what-- I say,
what do you feel like doing today?

09:24.378 --> 09:27.113
Amusement park?
Putt putt golf?

09:27.147 --> 09:28.214
Ice skating?

09:28.248 --> 09:30.750
Great.
All of it.

09:31.719 --> 09:33.753
I got nothing on my schedule.

09:33.788 --> 09:34.955
Mentor away.

09:34.989 --> 09:36.323
Heh heh heh.

09:36.357 --> 09:38.592
Ha ha ha!

09:40.228 --> 09:41.028
Henry!

09:41.062 --> 09:42.863
Give me my chickens.

09:42.897 --> 09:45.966
Hold still, chicken.

09:46.001 --> 09:49.136
Put him down. I told you,
that's not a chicken.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.304
Either you give me a chicken,

09:50.338 --> 09:53.507
or this thing that
looks like a chicken gets it.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.274
Henry.

09:54.309 --> 09:56.977
This doesn't concern you, piggy.

09:57.012 --> 09:58.545
Come on, lady.
Give me my chicken.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.381
We don't have chickens.

10:00.415 --> 10:01.515
This is a pet store.

10:01.550 --> 10:02.850
Chickens are not pets.

10:02.885 --> 10:06.420
I don't want to pet it.
I want to eat it.

10:09.158 --> 10:12.961
Henry, I've been looking
all over for you.

10:12.996 --> 10:14.229
Are you this boy's father?

10:14.264 --> 10:16.031
Well, I'm his father figure.

10:16.065 --> 10:17.833
Well, you're not a very good one.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.201
That's the understatement of the year.

10:19.236 --> 10:21.670
I asked him for chicken,
and he won't give me chicken.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.239
Why won't you give him chicken?

10:23.273 --> 10:24.841
This is not about chicken.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.142
This is about respect

10:26.176 --> 10:28.945
and not always getting what you want

10:28.979 --> 10:30.713
when you want it.

10:30.748 --> 10:31.748
I'm getting chicken.

10:31.782 --> 10:35.051
Not as long as you're
with me you're not.

10:35.086 --> 10:36.720
Ok.

10:36.754 --> 10:38.821
Henry!

10:43.289 --> 10:46.991
Walter, what are you-- what
are you doing with a shotgun?

10:47.025 --> 10:48.125
It's a rifle.

10:48.159 --> 10:52.061
I figured it's about time
my son bagged his first buck.

10:52.095 --> 10:53.428
What are you talking about?

10:53.463 --> 10:54.596
We're going hunting.

10:54.631 --> 10:58.433
It's an important milestone
in a father-son relationship.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.768
Walter, enough with
the father-son stuff.

11:00.803 --> 11:03.071
The tennis tournament's next weekend.

11:03.105 --> 11:04.605
I want to play tennis.

11:04.640 --> 11:09.543
Look at you,
standing up to your old man.

11:09.578 --> 11:11.679
That's an important milestone, too.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.281
You're growing up.

11:15.116 --> 11:17.184
Finally I'm gonna get
to play some tennis.

11:17.218 --> 11:22.956
Ok, let's rally a bit
to see where we are.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.624
Ahh!

11:24.658 --> 11:28.260
No problem.
We're just getting warmed up.

11:30.497 --> 11:32.164
Uhh!

11:34.534 --> 11:37.402
Whoops. Sorry.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.604
Is anyone ever gonna
hit a ball back to me?

11:39.638 --> 11:42.373
You know what, why don't you serve?

11:42.407 --> 11:46.643
All right, but you might
want to stand back.

11:49.846 --> 11:51.647
Uhh!

11:55.585 --> 11:56.718
Let me guess.

11:56.753 --> 11:58.921
Lola got her tennis skills from you.

11:58.955 --> 12:02.191
I taught her everything she knows.

12:02.225 --> 12:06.161
Henry, I know we got off
to a bad start,

12:06.196 --> 12:09.131
but I'm not giving up on you.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
What are we doing?

12:11.234 --> 12:13.636
Well, the textile museum
doesn't open until noon.

12:13.670 --> 12:18.274
But that doesn't mean we can't
have fun right here and now.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.643
By staring at a wall?

12:20.677 --> 12:22.111
It's not just a wall.

12:22.146 --> 12:24.447
It's a freshly-painted wall.

12:24.481 --> 12:27.282
You know, right now the paint is wet.

12:27.317 --> 12:28.684
Soon, it'll be less wet.

12:28.718 --> 12:33.955
And if we're lucky, we'll be here the
moment it's no longer wet at all,

12:33.990 --> 12:37.392
or dry.

12:37.426 --> 12:39.093
You're watching paint dry?

12:39.128 --> 12:40.662
That's the most boring
thing in the world.

12:40.696 --> 12:44.032
That's why there's an expression,
"watching paint dry."

12:44.066 --> 12:47.269
We're literally doing the expression.

12:48.953 --> 12:50.020
Chicken.

12:50.140 --> 12:50.884
Henry!

12:51.004 --> 12:54.942
What is it with that kid and chicken?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.870
This is so wonderful.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.811
Sitting here with my son

13:03.845 --> 13:06.614
about to play in a tennis tournament.

13:06.648 --> 13:09.729
Oh, I wish this feeling
would last forever.

13:09.849 --> 13:11.863
Well, it's probably
gonna last about 20 minutes,

13:11.930 --> 13:14.021
'cause they're gonna
wipe the court with us.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.366
Yeah. What say?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.668
We've been practicing
every day for a week.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.737
Your forehand hasn't
gotten any better,

13:19.772 --> 13:22.440
somehow your backhand
has gotten worse,

13:22.475 --> 13:23.775
you still can't serve,

13:23.809 --> 13:24.842
you're afraid of the net.

13:24.877 --> 13:27.679
The close you get,
the faster they come.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.114
What are we going to do?

13:29.148 --> 13:30.549
Whenever the ball comes to us,

13:30.583 --> 13:33.118
get out of the way and let me hit it.

13:33.152 --> 13:34.052
Brilliant.

13:34.086 --> 13:37.790
You know, that's also
from Patricia's side.

13:54.742 --> 13:57.477
Oh, Bugs, this strategy of yours

13:57.511 --> 13:59.078
is working to perfection.

13:59.113 --> 14:00.480
We've made it to the finals.

14:00.514 --> 14:02.482
And I feel like I've hardly
broken a sweat.

14:02.516 --> 14:07.053
Well, I can't complain about not
getting to hit the ball anymore.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.788
Ha ha ha!

14:08.822 --> 14:11.458
Ha ha ha.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.196
Daffy, what are you doing here?

14:16.230 --> 14:19.232
I'm playing in the finals of the
father son tennis tournament.

14:19.266 --> 14:20.533
What are you doing here?

14:20.567 --> 14:24.236
I'm playing in the finals of the
father son tennis tournament.

14:24.270 --> 14:25.504
Where's your father?

14:25.538 --> 14:26.472
I'm right here.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.473
You're not his father.

14:27.507 --> 14:30.576
What are you
even doing here?

14:30.610 --> 14:32.444
Weren't you banned from this club?

14:32.478 --> 14:36.281
How dare--I say, how dare you
speak to my boy like that.

14:36.315 --> 14:39.318
Why he--I say,
he's just a child.

14:39.352 --> 14:40.686
Thank you, father.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.721
He's not your father.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.590
I'm his father.
I say, I'm his father figure.

14:44.625 --> 14:48.461
Well, it's not the father
figure son tournament,

14:48.496 --> 14:50.564
it's the father son tournament.

14:50.598 --> 14:54.302
Look, we could--I say,
we could stand here all day

14:54.336 --> 14:55.436
and quiver over the rules,

14:55.470 --> 14:57.838
or we could settle--
I say, we could settle

14:57.872 --> 14:59.206
the matter on the court.

14:59.241 --> 15:04.011
May the best fake father son team win.

15:04.313 --> 15:08.849
Oh, no. The textile museum's
closed on Sundays.

15:08.884 --> 15:10.418
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

15:10.452 --> 15:14.856
I was really looking forward to
seeing all those tablecloths.

15:14.890 --> 15:16.023
I was too.

15:16.058 --> 15:17.725
I was being sarcastic.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.894
Now, can we please
go get some chicken?

15:19.928 --> 15:23.297
Henry, you don't want chicken.

15:23.332 --> 15:24.031
Say what?

15:24.099 --> 15:26.334
The chicken is just a metaphor

15:26.368 --> 15:29.071
for what you're
really hungry for--

15:29.105 --> 15:31.073
guidance.

15:31.441 --> 15:33.409
I can see from that
expression on your face

15:33.443 --> 15:34.677
that really resonated with you.

15:34.711 --> 15:38.446
Now come on. I have one more
thing planned for today.

15:38.481 --> 15:40.415
Do you like tennis?

15:44.087 --> 15:46.154
We're watching tennis?

15:46.189 --> 15:48.056
I thought we was gonna play tennis.

15:48.090 --> 15:50.858
Oh, I'm not very good at sports.

15:50.893 --> 15:53.661
Chocolate?

15:55.930 --> 15:59.600
Just remember-- I say, just
remember what I told you, son.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.969
It's not whether you win or lose,

16:02.004 --> 16:03.604
it's how hard you try.

16:03.639 --> 16:04.939
Just remember what I told you.

16:04.974 --> 16:08.476
Get out of the way
and let me hit the ball.

16:23.593 --> 16:25.127
Ha ha ha!

16:31.636 --> 16:35.038
- Bugs, whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

16:45.917 --> 16:47.517
Uhh!

16:48.953 --> 16:49.953
Uhh!

16:49.987 --> 16:51.488
Uhh!

16:53.424 --> 16:54.390
You gotta bring the heat.

16:54.425 --> 16:56.993
They win this point
and they win the match.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.861
We've already won, son,

16:58.896 --> 17:01.631
because we're having fun.

17:03.534 --> 17:05.167
I can't see anything.

17:05.203 --> 17:06.636
I'm gonna go get some chicken.

17:06.704 --> 17:07.871
Henry, I told you.

17:07.905 --> 17:09.906
Chicken's just a metaphor.

17:09.973 --> 17:10.839
Excuse me.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.675
Would you mind scooting over
so he can see?

17:24.955 --> 17:27.692
Aah!

17:30.062 --> 17:34.699
Gosh, get this boy--
get him off me.

17:34.733 --> 17:35.467
Aah!

17:47.813 --> 17:53.318
Huh. I guess chicken
wasn't a metaphor after all.

17:54.553 --> 17:58.590
I'm sorry we didn't get
to finish the match, Bugs.

17:58.624 --> 18:01.359
I know how much you wanted to win.

18:01.394 --> 18:03.962
Well, the tournament's over.

18:03.996 --> 18:08.700
I guess that means we're
no longer father and son.

18:08.735 --> 18:10.803
Ohh.

18:10.837 --> 18:14.607
I'll see you around.

18:15.575 --> 18:17.243
Hey, Walter.

18:17.277 --> 18:20.813
I heard there's a father son
golf tournament coming up.

18:20.847 --> 18:22.181
How's your golf game?

18:22.216 --> 18:25.918
Even worse than my tennis game.

18:25.952 --> 18:27.720
Well, then we better play some golf.

18:27.754 --> 18:29.722
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

18:29.756 --> 18:33.058
No, wait.
You're the dad.

18:33.093 --> 18:34.393
You pick me up.

18:34.428 --> 18:38.263
You've got a big heart, Bugs Bunny.

18:38.298 --> 18:42.167
You get that from
my side of the family.

18:48.907 --> 18:49.874
There, all fixed up.

18:49.908 --> 18:52.142
But I still don't
understand personally

18:52.177 --> 18:55.412
what a chicken hawk
was doing at a tennis match.

18:55.447 --> 18:58.315
Look...I'm you.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.618
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

19:00.652 --> 19:02.420
Hey, whoa, whoa.
What's the matter with you?

19:02.454 --> 19:07.358
Fiddling with my stuff?
What are you, 9 years old?

19:07.392 --> 19:09.961
He's 7.

19:09.995 --> 19:11.830
There's something I have to tell you.

19:11.864 --> 19:14.833
I'm quitting
the father figure program.

19:14.901 --> 19:15.701
But why?

19:15.735 --> 19:17.870
I'm not really 7 years old.

19:17.904 --> 19:18.837
You're not?

19:18.872 --> 19:22.240
No. But I know there's
a 7-year-old somewhere

19:22.275 --> 19:26.611
who would be lucky to have you
as a father figure.

19:27.647 --> 19:31.750
You'll always be my boy, Daffy Duck.

19:33.052 --> 19:34.920
You sure you don't want
to keep up the charade?

19:34.954 --> 19:39.391
We were having-- I say, we
were having a grand ol' time.

19:39.459 --> 19:40.492
I can't.

19:40.527 --> 19:41.927
I won't tell.

19:41.961 --> 19:43.095
No, I mean I can't.

19:43.129 --> 19:46.265
Carol ratted me out and got
me banned from the program.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.867
Heh heh. Carol.

19:47.901 --> 19:51.571
Always wanting to spoil our fun.

19:52.673 --> 19:54.541
Mmm.

19:54.575 --> 19:56.309
Oh, man, that's good.

19:56.343 --> 19:57.844
Ahh, mmm.
That's nice.

19:57.878 --> 19:58.745
That's--ooh.

19:58.779 --> 20:00.780
This is the best chicken
I've ever tasted.

20:00.814 --> 20:02.848
It's my grandmother's recipe.

20:02.883 --> 20:06.118
Maybe next weekend you could
teach me how to make it.

20:06.152 --> 20:07.186
Next weekend?

20:07.220 --> 20:09.755
You mean you still want me
to be your father figure?

20:09.789 --> 20:12.291
You're the only father figure
who didn't give up on me.

20:12.325 --> 20:15.727
And that's better than
all the chicken in the world.

20:16.329 --> 20:18.230
Maybe not this chicken.
This is pretty good.

20:18.265 --> 20:21.233
You know, when we're not
watching grass grow,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.101
you can actually be pretty fun.

20:23.135 --> 20:26.538
Aw, you're a good kid, Henry.

20:26.572 --> 20:28.739
But that does sound fun.

20:28.774 --> 20:31.442
- What does?
- Watching grass grow.

20:31.476 --> 20:33.845
I wonder where we could see some.

20:33.879 --> 20:35.513
Ahh, my front yard.

20:35.581 --> 20:38.116
It's covered in grass.

20:39.251 --> 20:42.988
Come on, Henry.
You're missing it.

20:43.022 --> 20:45.423
Look at it grow, Henry.

20:45.458 --> 20:49.061
Look at that grass grow.

21:20.494 --> 21:24.531
That's my--
I say, that's my boy.
