00:26.568 --> 00:32.846
We are monsters, we are proud
We are monsters, say it loud

00:33.575 --> 00:37.954
'Cause tonight, we're gonna
leave our fears behind

00:37.955 --> 00:40.456
We're in it together

00:40.457 --> 00:44.502
Stepping out and we're
letting our spirits fly

00:44.503 --> 00:46.731
Stay fierce forever

00:48.799 --> 00:51.277
Freak out if you dare

00:52.052 --> 00:53.574
Your best nightmare

00:53.595 --> 00:58.140
Don't stop rocking
your right to fright

00:58.141 --> 01:01.519
We are Monster High

01:01.520 --> 01:05.272
We are monsters, we are proud
We are monsters

01:05.274 --> 01:07.923
We are Monster High

01:29.756 --> 01:30.948
I can't see!

01:31.008 --> 01:32.174
Watch it.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.870
Sorry. Excuse me. Coming through.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.849
Oh!

01:39.850 --> 01:43.519
I am not brave enough
to be your Queen,

01:43.520 --> 01:47.189
but the heart tells me I must.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.360
I am afraid to claim my throne!

01:51.361 --> 01:57.969
But I am not afraid to reveal
my affections for you.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.494
Well, one of you.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.248
Be with me, Princess, and my
chiseled chin, not Edweird.

02:04.249 --> 02:09.947
No, Princess, forget Alucard, be
with me and my dazzling dimples.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.467
Oh! Her Majesty and Alucard
will make such a regal couple.

02:14.468 --> 02:18.054
Try dusting your eyes. Edweird
is the clear choice for her.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.458
Look at Edweird.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.558
Oh!

02:22.559 --> 02:24.226
Love the dimples.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.672
Naw, I love Alucard's chin.

02:27.731 --> 02:32.462
If they could only see that
there is more to me than beauty

02:33.737 --> 02:37.615
and royal destiny, but alas,

02:37.616 --> 02:41.687
I have a secret.

02:42.788 --> 02:47.708
I am not the ghoul you think I am.

02:47.709 --> 02:52.171
Vampire scaritage requires you
to reveal all of your secrets

02:52.172 --> 02:54.548
before your coronation as Queen.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.592
Oh, my ghoul!

02:56.593 --> 03:00.680
Totes fake! Vampire
royalty has no such rule!

03:00.681 --> 03:04.206
Hey, sit down! Trying to
watch a moo-vie here.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.645
Yeah, you're blocking my
view of Veronica Von Vamp!

03:07.646 --> 03:09.498
She's hot!

03:09.523 --> 03:14.220
This is the best boovie ever.
And Veronica Von Vamp as the Queen?

03:14.236 --> 03:15.611
Fangtastic!

03:15.612 --> 03:19.865
Please. She is a disgrace
to vampire scaritage.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.684
Hauntlywood got it all wrong!

03:22.911 --> 03:28.040
Well, sorry! But I know how
this really works, I was there!

03:28.041 --> 03:30.189
Did you know vampires haven't had

03:30.210 --> 03:31.836
a proper Queen for over 400 years?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.089
But this is totally fake!

03:35.090 --> 03:37.067
Quiet! I'm watching a movie!

03:40.137 --> 03:42.805
Thanks for talking the whole time.

03:42.806 --> 03:47.476
Make way.
It's her Royal Fakeness!

03:47.477 --> 03:50.046
Draculaura, you owe me a movie.

03:53.316 --> 04:00.156
Sorry if I got carried away, but that
Veronica, she just frosts my fangs.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.490
You better get used to her.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.702
The Vampire Majesty boovies are
the most popular ever made.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.037
Popular does not mean good.

04:07.038 --> 04:11.063
Well, I loved it. And her.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.568
But the real story is so
much more fangtastic.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.692
I should know, I did
grow up in Transylvania.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.510
At the Vampire Royal Court.

04:21.511 --> 04:26.056
We don't usually talk about it.
I had to leave in a hurry.

04:26.057 --> 04:30.811
How is it that there hasn't been
a Vampire Queen for 400 years?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.961
Yeah! Tell us all the
voltageous details.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.335
Especially the romantic parts!

04:36.359 --> 04:39.588
Well, after the last
Queen's reign ended,

04:39.613 --> 04:42.865
the search began for
the next ghoul in line.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.033
I love this!

04:44.034 --> 04:47.953
They used an ancient jewel,
the Vampire's Heart,

04:47.954 --> 04:52.041
that was supposed to magically
lead the way to the future Queen.

04:52.042 --> 04:56.212
The search has gone on for 400
years, but they haven't found her.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.881
- So the Queen could be anybody?
- And anywhere?

04:58.882 --> 05:02.327
Yep. Now wouldn't that
make a much better boovie?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.828
I'll say...

05:04.805 --> 05:06.578
Youch! Hoodude!

05:08.016 --> 05:11.977
Sorry, Heath, I still can't
control my voodoo powers.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.398
Maybe you're secretly
the Queen, Draculaura!

05:16.399 --> 05:17.546
Wow! That would be cool.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.759
That would be clawsome!

05:18.819 --> 05:21.904
Whoa, Clawd Wolf, dating royalty.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.615
Allow me, Your Royal Highness.

05:24.616 --> 05:28.369
Would you prefer the diamond
or gold crown, My Queen?

05:28.370 --> 05:32.456
Come on, Frankie, I think I'd
know if I was really Queen.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.584
But I choose diamonds.
They go with everything.

05:35.585 --> 05:41.215
Hear ye, hear ye! Make way
for Queen Draculaura!

05:42.425 --> 05:44.343
- See you later.
- Okay. Bye-bye!

05:44.344 --> 05:45.445
Text ya.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.099
Please, you the Queen?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.170
You don't even have your
vampire powers yet.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.728
I never said...

05:54.729 --> 05:58.129
You think that you're all bat,
but what have you ever done?

06:00.902 --> 06:03.612
You two better watch your fangs!

06:03.613 --> 06:07.074
Don't fret, love. It's what you
think of you that's important.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.660
Do you want me to unleash
a plague on them?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.955
Because I have a new amulet
I've been dying to try out.

06:14.124 --> 06:18.168
Thanks, ghouls, but I can
fight my own battles.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.907
You'll be Queen when trolls fly.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.601
They're right, I have never
done anything important.

06:33.602 --> 06:37.146
That's why I don't have all
my vampire powers yet.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.272
What do you mean?

06:38.273 --> 06:41.252
Gory got hers a couple
of hundred years ago

06:41.276 --> 06:44.220
by saving a Vampire
Lord from a sunburn.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
SPF, like 1,000.

06:47.282 --> 06:52.536
I haven't done anything even close
to that. I may never get my powers.

06:52.537 --> 06:58.751
Draculaura, you have something
amazing in you. I feel it, in here.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.171
You are going to surprise everyone!

07:02.172 --> 07:06.118
I hope. Thanks, Robecca.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.251
Master, the Royal Court of Vampire

07:19.272 --> 07:22.546
Dignitaries seeks audience
with you at once.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.428
Very well.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.258
Huh?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.600
What seems to be the problem?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.645
Lord Stoker, we demand to know how

07:37.666 --> 07:39.985
the search for the Queen is going!

07:41.211 --> 07:44.630
You've had 400 years! Where is she?

07:44.631 --> 07:49.051
We think you're enjoying your temporary
role as our leader much too much!

07:49.052 --> 07:54.158
I assure you I have everything under
control. The search for the Queen...

07:54.224 --> 07:55.891
Is taking too long!

07:55.892 --> 08:01.605
We need a true leader! Vampires
are forgetting their scaritage!

08:01.606 --> 08:05.067
We just heard that Vampire Prep,

08:05.068 --> 08:10.072
our most prestigious vampire
academy, is on the verge of closing!

08:10.073 --> 08:12.241
The Vampire Court has voted.

08:12.242 --> 08:17.079
If you do not find a new Queen by the
end of the week, you will be fired!

08:18.581 --> 08:23.357
Well, you're in luck because
I already found the Queen!

08:23.378 --> 08:25.196
- Really?
- Really?

08:25.213 --> 08:30.843
Yes! I used the Vampire's Heart
and, just today, I found her.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.927
Isn't that right, Ygor?

08:31.928 --> 08:35.347
No, no, you lost the
Vampire's Heart when...

08:37.976 --> 08:39.977
Ygor means, yes, Master.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.078
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

08:41.104 --> 08:45.858
Yes! In fact, her
coronation is next week!

08:46.943 --> 08:49.862
Queen! Queen! Queen!

08:49.863 --> 08:53.741
Good. We meet the Queen
next week, Stoker.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.015
Or it's daylight for you.

09:03.501 --> 09:08.823
Next week? Ygor, have
you lost your mind?

09:08.840 --> 09:13.070
No, Ygor still keeps
it in this little jar.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.226
How are you going to
find a Queen in a week?

09:21.227 --> 09:27.630
The Vampire's Heart was stolen by
your niece 400 years ago when she...

09:27.650 --> 09:30.970
I don't want to find the Queen!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.556
Right! Because...

09:36.284 --> 09:39.620
Remind Ygor why again, Master.

09:39.621 --> 09:45.000
Because once we have a Queen,
I will no longer be in charge.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.627
Ah! Yes.

09:46.628 --> 09:51.673
I am the only one who knows
what's good for vampires!

09:51.674 --> 09:54.927
What I need is a fake Queen,

09:54.928 --> 09:58.972
one I can control and
bend to my will.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.292
Yes, Master!

10:02.185 --> 10:04.686
There! She's perfect!

10:04.687 --> 10:07.147
The daughter of Dracula,

10:07.148 --> 10:12.194
with all his enlightened ideas
about monster equality.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.696
I remember her from court.

10:14.697 --> 10:19.618
She was always so naive,
insecure, and feeble,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.746
I imagine she doesn't even
have her vampire powers yet.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.147
You won't have the
courage to question me,

10:26.167 --> 10:29.521
isn't that right, my new Queen?

10:33.758 --> 10:34.984
Yes.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.365
Okay, Daddy.

10:40.974 --> 10:46.501
Yes, I know to floss my fangs!
I'll call you in six months.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.383
Okay. Smooches! Love you!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.234
Six months?

10:52.235 --> 10:54.884
Yeah, business trip, Antarctica,

10:54.904 --> 10:57.507
six months day, six
months night, you know.

10:58.408 --> 11:03.184
Oh, make way, it's her
Royal Fakeness.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.000
All hail Queen Draculaura!

11:09.502 --> 11:14.131
Class! Class! Settle down, class.

11:14.132 --> 11:18.552
Today we'll be continuing
our discussion of history.

11:18.553 --> 11:24.376
This is your scaritage!
The journey to the Boo World.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.937
Londoom was a stopping point
for immigrating monsters.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.441
They left their homelands
for many reasons.

11:32.442 --> 11:36.987
Probably because they were
an embarrassment to their kind.

11:36.988 --> 11:40.888
Or 'cause they made up
stories about being Queen.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.811
Stop torturing me!

11:46.915 --> 11:48.232
Draculaura!

11:48.917 --> 11:52.836
Don't spook until you are
spook-en to. Detention!

11:56.466 --> 11:58.819
Could this day get any worse?

11:59.469 --> 12:04.917
Attention, Draculaura, report to the
Headmistress's office immediately!

12:05.099 --> 12:07.952
Hashtag, "In trouble, again."

12:09.729 --> 12:14.107
I am so, so sorry I yelled in
class, Headmistress Bloodgood, I...

12:14.108 --> 12:17.402
Draculaura, you are...

12:17.403 --> 12:20.097
...the next Vampire Queen!

12:20.365 --> 12:23.242
Me? But I'm...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.516
You are the chosen one!

12:25.536 --> 12:29.164
Lord Stoker!
What are you doing here?

12:29.165 --> 12:35.212
I was led to you by
the Vampire's Heart!

12:35.213 --> 12:36.530
Oh!

12:45.890 --> 12:49.810
See how it glows in your presence!

12:49.811 --> 12:53.689
I really am the next Queen!

12:53.690 --> 12:56.634
All hail Her New Vampiric Majesty!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.300
Headmistress Bloodgood,
Gory has been

13:00.321 --> 13:02.594
picking on Draculaura all day...

13:02.657 --> 13:05.135
All hail the Queen.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.147
Thank you. Hearing
that never gets old.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.767
Um, they mean me.
I'm the next Vampire Queen.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.042
- Wow.
- Amazing!

13:14.043 --> 13:17.546
Draculaura's the Queen? No way!

13:19.090 --> 13:20.191
Uh...

13:20.216 --> 13:24.553
I mean, uh, no way

13:24.554 --> 13:28.158
I won't be the first
one to say congrats!

13:28.308 --> 13:33.979
Have I told you how much I love
that outfit, Your Majesty?

13:33.980 --> 13:37.816
We must leave for
Transylvania, immediately.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.570
Wait, no, I can't be Queen, it would
mean leaving all of my friends,

13:41.571 --> 13:43.822
and Monster High is my home.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.909
What if I never come back?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.579
Draculaura, listen to me.

13:50.580 --> 13:55.902
Yes, being Queen is difficult for
one of your limited abilities.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.795
But you are important.

13:58.796 --> 14:03.592
Don't worry, I will take care
of all the messy details.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.367
The Heart chose you for a reason.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.181
It is for the good of your people.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.975
I'm important?

14:11.976 --> 14:14.519
I've always said you were!

14:14.520 --> 14:16.605
Can my ghoulfriends come?

14:16.606 --> 14:20.150
Oh! I've always wanted
to see Transylvania!

14:20.151 --> 14:21.443
Of course!

14:21.444 --> 14:23.672
The Queen needs her
ladies-in-waiting

14:23.696 --> 14:25.864
to attend her at the coronation,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.575
which is next week,
so let's hurry it up, ah?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.771
Please, please, can they come,
Headmistress Bloodgood? Please!

14:31.788 --> 14:34.331
It would be dead-ucational.

14:34.332 --> 14:38.335
Well, I suppose it
would be a good chance

14:38.336 --> 14:41.315
to learn about your monster
scaritage in person.

14:42.757 --> 14:43.949
Okay!

14:44.008 --> 14:45.280
Fangulous!

14:45.301 --> 14:46.698
Yay!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.116
Transylvania, here I come!

14:49.013 --> 14:52.682
All right, yeah! Woo-hoo!

14:52.683 --> 14:57.380
Sorry, Gory, you'll be at the
Vampire Court when trolls fly.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.399
I should have seen that coming.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.983
Hate to be a bummer, Draculaura,

15:01.984 --> 15:03.610
but Ghoulia, Frankie and I have

15:03.611 --> 15:05.695
a major claw-culus
project due next week.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.239
We're totes happy for you.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.468
Wait, I have to tell Clawd!

15:10.493 --> 15:12.095
Tell me what?

15:12.870 --> 15:13.995
Whoa.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.791
Am I in trouble? Did I bury
something I wasn't supposed to?

15:17.792 --> 15:20.395
Hey, sweetie, remember how we joked

15:20.420 --> 15:23.004
about me being the Vampire Queen?

15:23.005 --> 15:26.405
Right, that was hilarious.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.969
You're not laughing.

15:28.970 --> 15:35.350
Yeah, well, turns out, I kinda,
sorta am the next Vampire Queen.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.521
And I have to leave for
Transylvania. Like, now.

15:39.522 --> 15:45.068
Wait! So, I guess that
means we're... We'll be...

15:45.069 --> 15:50.115
Yes. We'll be apart for seven days!

15:50.116 --> 15:53.410
That's like a month in wolf time!

15:53.411 --> 15:56.371
Who will take me on walks?

15:56.372 --> 16:01.334
Oh, Clawd! Oh, you'll be fine.
You're a good boy.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.655
Who ruvs you? Who does? I do!

16:07.341 --> 16:10.469
Now, fetch!

16:16.017 --> 16:20.213
Come, we must leave at once!
Your throne awaits!

16:20.229 --> 16:22.189
- Voltageous!
- Clawsome!

16:22.190 --> 16:23.337
Yeah!

16:26.444 --> 16:29.423
What's happening with Draculaura?

16:31.157 --> 16:33.601
Draculaura is the Queen?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.855
Wow!

16:43.044 --> 16:44.145
Ooh!

16:44.712 --> 16:46.004
Fancy!

16:46.005 --> 16:47.255
- So long!
- Goodbye!

16:47.256 --> 16:52.761
Goodbye, everyone.
I'll see you at my coronation.

16:52.762 --> 16:56.241
Come on, ghoul!
Your throne is waiting!

16:57.391 --> 16:58.433
Goodbye, Draculaura!

16:58.434 --> 16:59.535
Good luck!

17:06.817 --> 17:11.718
Goodbye, Draculaura!
Monster High will miss you!

17:12.323 --> 17:16.769
I'll miss you!

17:40.977 --> 17:45.981
Your tomato juice, Your Majesty!

17:45.982 --> 17:48.358
Bow to the Queen!

17:48.359 --> 17:52.779
Thank you. Ghoul, get up!
You don't have to do that.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.864
It's tradition.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.809
As my dad always says,
"Traditions can change."

17:57.827 --> 18:01.913
And as Master says, "Traditions
must never change,

18:01.914 --> 18:05.484
"and that traitor
Dracula's ideas are..."

18:06.586 --> 18:09.030
Enjoy your juice.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.442
So, tell us more about
what it was like

18:12.508 --> 18:15.010
to grow up in the Vampire Court!

18:15.011 --> 18:16.803
All that history.

18:17.888 --> 18:22.684
Sixteen hundred years of aristocracy
is nothing to brag about.

18:22.685 --> 18:27.022
Egyptian royalty has shoe sales
that last longer than that.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.468
Oh! The Vampire Court
was totes amazing!

18:30.484 --> 18:33.612
The beautiful dresses!
The grand balls!

18:33.613 --> 18:37.013
I used to sneak downstairs with
my best friend, Elissabat,

18:37.033 --> 18:41.183
Lord Stoker's niece, to
watch the Vampire Waltz.

18:41.203 --> 18:48.043
We all had so much fun. Well, except
for that old crankypants, Stoker.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.648
Yeah! Looks like he
hasn't smiled in 400 years.

18:51.714 --> 18:55.925
Stoker wanted control over
all other types of monsters.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.553
The whole court was divided.

18:58.554 --> 19:03.266
My father, Hexiciah Steam,
arrived in Transylvania then,

19:03.267 --> 19:05.602
just before the great split,

19:05.603 --> 19:09.898
when the more, open-minded monsters
emigrated to the Boo World.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.234
Stoker and my dad
did not get along.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.838
You see, my dad's very best fiend

19:15.905 --> 19:18.448
was Lord Stoker's younger brother.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.450
So what happened to him?

19:20.451 --> 19:22.804
Did he head off on a
mysterious expedition

19:22.828 --> 19:25.121
and no one has heard from him since

19:25.122 --> 19:27.040
or something like that?

19:27.041 --> 19:30.377
Yeah. Exactly like that!

19:30.378 --> 19:32.337
Wow, good guess.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.340
I feel like I know this story.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.944
Well, his only daughter, Elissabat,

19:37.968 --> 19:40.553
was put under her Uncle
Stoker's authority.

19:40.554 --> 19:45.517
There was a big argument between
Stoker and my dad about her future.

19:45.518 --> 19:51.091
Poor Elissabat, she wanted to be an
actor, but Stoker put his foot down.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.859
He said that she had to stay at the
court as a vampire-in-waiting.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.778
So your dad helped her?

19:56.779 --> 19:59.507
He tried. But then, she disappeared

19:59.532 --> 20:02.260
just before we fled Transylvania.

20:02.952 --> 20:08.873
We are now entering Transylvania.
Next stop, Castle Dracool!

20:08.874 --> 20:10.166
Ouch!

20:10.167 --> 20:11.501
Ow!

20:13.129 --> 20:14.230
Whoa!

20:14.255 --> 20:18.076
Glamorous Vampire
Court, here I come!

20:18.426 --> 20:19.509
Whoa!

20:19.510 --> 20:20.611
Ouch!

20:21.178 --> 20:22.575
Ouch!

20:26.726 --> 20:29.978
Behold, Castle Dracool!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.813
- Magnificent!
- O-M-Ghoul!

20:31.814 --> 20:34.190
Well, it's no pyramid.

20:34.191 --> 20:38.570
It looks just like the one in
the Vampire Majesty boovies.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.740
Ygor's not allowed to see boovies.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.469
A vulgar waste of time. Bleh!

20:44.493 --> 20:49.497
I haven't been here in forevs!
Such memories!

20:49.498 --> 20:53.102
Come on, ghouls,
I'll show you around.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.167
Whoa! Oof. Ah!

21:28.996 --> 21:30.518
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

21:48.224 --> 21:49.307
Ah!

21:49.308 --> 21:53.937
Yay! Hoo hoo! I forgot how
wonderful this castle is.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.356
So dark and dreary! I love it!

21:56.357 --> 21:58.004
Grand, I say!

21:58.067 --> 21:59.734
Nice, as far as castles go.

22:04.198 --> 22:09.911
Lord Stoker has sent Ygor to
bring the new Queen to his study

22:09.912 --> 22:12.330
to hear the rules.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.375
Well, duty calls.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.085
- Later!
- Good luck!

22:17.086 --> 22:20.338
Queen problems, am I right, ladies?

22:23.926 --> 22:29.514
Wait in here, My Queen.
Do not touch anything.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.433
Master gets very grumpy.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.706
Ah! Ouch!

22:51.787 --> 22:55.061
The Vampire's Heart!

22:55.583 --> 22:56.684
Huh?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.968
What are you doing?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.554
You ever heard
of knocking? So rude.

23:09.555 --> 23:15.082
What are you doing with that?
You didn't find anything else, did you?

23:15.102 --> 23:18.547
I just touched the Heart,
but it didn't light up.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.758
Vampire scaritage
says it always glows

23:20.816 --> 23:23.026
when the true Queen touches it.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.504
What gives?

23:24.528 --> 23:27.614
No need to worry your
pretty little head.

23:27.615 --> 23:31.451
I just have to change
the batteries and it...

23:31.452 --> 23:32.553
Uh-Oh.

23:32.578 --> 23:36.664
Batteries? Oh, my ghoul!
It's a fake!

23:36.665 --> 23:40.110
Wait, then that means
I'm not Queen?

23:41.503 --> 23:42.670
Oh!

23:42.671 --> 23:45.024
The people need to be told!

23:49.053 --> 23:55.850
I command you! Stop! What
the people need is a Queen.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.019
And you are just the
ghoul for the job.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.773
Why me? Why not try to
find the real Queen?

24:01.774 --> 24:04.233
Because you will do as I say!

24:04.234 --> 24:06.194
I will remain in charge, of course,

24:06.195 --> 24:09.697
and in return you will live a
life of luxury as the Queen.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.740
Not a bad deal.

24:10.741 --> 24:11.824
This isn't right.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.369
Dear, Draculaura,

24:14.370 --> 24:18.395
aren't you tired of monsters
like, what was her name,

24:18.415 --> 24:21.042
that Gory picking on you?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.710
Don't you want to matter?

24:22.711 --> 24:28.091
To go down in history as a
famous, important vampire?

24:28.092 --> 24:32.553
Don't you want to finally
get your vampire powers?

24:32.554 --> 24:35.848
Well, yes, I do, but...

24:35.849 --> 24:37.892
Good! Then you shall
serve as my puppet.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.496
All you have to do is jump
when I pull the strings.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.647
What do you want me to do?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.899
Your first order of
business will be

24:44.900 --> 24:48.027
to stop the intermingling of
vampires and other monsters.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.007
You and I will turn
back the clock to

24:51.073 --> 24:54.017
a time when vampires
ruled the world!

24:54.076 --> 24:56.520
There will be strict
rules to ensure

24:56.537 --> 24:58.955
that we return to our former glory,

24:58.956 --> 25:03.292
as the most respected and
feared monsters in the land.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.588
Do we have an agreement, My Queen?

25:07.589 --> 25:10.591
I don't think you have a choice.

25:16.974 --> 25:21.602
And that's reason 104 pyramids
are superior to castles.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.455
Reason 105...

25:28.444 --> 25:31.923
Draculaura? What's wrong?

25:32.489 --> 25:37.577
Nothing, except I'm
not the real Queen!

25:37.578 --> 25:40.288
But the Vampire's Heart?

25:40.289 --> 25:44.235
At Monster High, when
you touched it, it glowed.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.069
You're the Queen.

25:46.128 --> 25:49.005
Lord Stoker faked it.
The real one is gone.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.924
And Stoker chose me to be the
Queen because I'm just a nobody,

25:51.925 --> 25:53.993
who will do whatever he says.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.557
You still get all these
clothes though, right?

25:59.558 --> 26:04.771
I mean, being a fake Queen is still
better than not being royal at all.

26:04.772 --> 26:08.691
Never thought I'd say this,
but Cleo has a point,

26:08.692 --> 26:12.111
the vampires have been without
a Queen for a long time.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.988
- You'd still be helping.
- No!

26:13.989 --> 26:19.577
He wants me to make vampires
rule over all other monsters!

26:19.578 --> 26:23.664
We won't be allowed to be friends
with anyone but vampires!

26:23.665 --> 26:25.041
That's horrible!

26:25.042 --> 26:29.754
Wait, if you're not the Queen,
then who is?

26:29.755 --> 26:34.425
Only the Vampire's Heart knows,
and it's been missing for...

26:34.426 --> 26:38.346
Wait! Maybe this is how I can help!

26:38.347 --> 26:40.415
How I can finally do
something important

26:40.432 --> 26:42.455
to make a difference to my people!

26:42.518 --> 26:46.187
If I find the Heart,
I find the Queen!

26:46.188 --> 26:48.256
And she can put a stop to Stoker!

26:48.315 --> 26:49.507
Yes! Right on, ghoul!

26:49.525 --> 26:50.751
As long as you get
to keep some shoes!

26:50.776 --> 26:54.005
Oh, though, how am
I going to do that?

26:54.029 --> 26:59.325
I have a strong feeling that there
are clues here, in the castle,

26:59.326 --> 27:02.578
but where?

27:02.579 --> 27:05.273
Stoker's study. He went batty when

27:05.290 --> 27:07.917
he thought I going
through his stuff.

27:07.918 --> 27:12.213
I'll distract him while you
sneak in and search it.

27:12.214 --> 27:15.784
Great idea! Time to kick some bat!

27:22.224 --> 27:24.418
Hello, Stokey.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.981
It's Lord Stoker, My Queen.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.504
Have you made your decision?

27:31.525 --> 27:33.002
I have.

27:33.068 --> 27:37.989
I will be your "Queen."
It's too good to pass up.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.117
Excellent. I think this
will work out well.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.410
Yes!

27:42.411 --> 27:45.515
I was hoping to go
over some questions

27:45.581 --> 27:48.685
about the whole being
Queen part thing.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.834
Uh!

27:49.835 --> 27:52.628
Ask if you must, but make it quick,

27:52.629 --> 27:55.673
you have an appointment with
important vamp-bassadors.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.745
Oh, this won't take, uh, too long.

28:06.518 --> 28:12.170
Okay, just look, should I wave
with my left or right arm?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.066
It does not matter.

28:14.067 --> 28:17.278
Okay, okay, then I'll do
right, how does that look?

28:17.279 --> 28:21.324
Now, do you want me to wave
from the elbow or wrist?

28:21.325 --> 28:23.098
Because I was thinking I could do

28:23.118 --> 28:24.827
a fun combination of jazz hands...

28:24.828 --> 28:26.954
Wave however you please!

28:26.955 --> 28:28.497
We have no time for this,

28:28.498 --> 28:32.543
I must present a Queen to the
vamp-bassadors, let us go.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.756
Okay, I guess I don't have to
be that convincing of a Queen

28:36.757 --> 28:38.174
for the vamp-bassadors.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.324
Wouldn't want it to seem fake.

28:42.137 --> 28:46.162
I suppose a little more
preparation could not hurt.

28:46.183 --> 28:49.310
Oh! Great! This will be fangtastic!

28:49.311 --> 28:51.979
Okay, let's pick out
a coronation outfit.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.774
I like pink, it's my favorite color.
What's yours?

29:06.453 --> 29:09.997
Okay, how do we sneak in?

29:09.998 --> 29:14.001
That Ygor guy's not exactly the
roundest gizmo in the gear,

29:14.002 --> 29:16.901
but he's not leaving that door.

29:16.922 --> 29:20.049
There has to be a secret
passage, but where?

29:21.134 --> 29:22.885
Ghoul-sundheit.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.490
Hey, hey. ghouls!

29:26.515 --> 29:27.616
Hoodude?

29:27.683 --> 29:29.100
Did ya miss me?

29:29.101 --> 29:30.434
Whoa!

29:30.435 --> 29:31.787
I'm good! I'm good!

29:31.812 --> 29:33.129
What are you doing here?

29:33.146 --> 29:35.624
I stowed away. I just couldn't wait

29:35.691 --> 29:38.192
a whole week to see
all the royalty.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.611
So you've been hiding in
the armor this whole time?

29:40.612 --> 29:45.969
Oh, no, I've been everywhere. This
place is loaded with secret passages.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.809
See?

29:50.664 --> 29:51.765
Oh!

30:01.091 --> 30:04.365
Here we are!
Lord Grumpypants' study.

30:11.727 --> 30:14.895
Elissabat. Stoker's niece!

30:14.896 --> 30:19.217
You sure they're related? I mean,
that ghoul is actually smiling!

30:20.861 --> 30:22.759
Draculaura's father.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.348
Whoa! Let me see! Whoa!

30:26.825 --> 30:27.926
Oh!

30:29.911 --> 30:31.354
Wow! Neato!

30:34.916 --> 30:38.896
"Dear Count Dracula,
as my father's beast friend,

30:38.920 --> 30:42.024
"I beseech you. I have discovered

30:42.090 --> 30:45.160
"that I am the next heir in line

30:45.177 --> 30:47.845
"to be the Vampire Queen.

30:47.846 --> 30:53.392
"If my uncle finds out, he will
use me to control all vampires

30:53.393 --> 30:57.313
"to ensure our supremacy
over other monsters.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.150
"I do not want to be a puppet.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.629
"But he is too strong."

31:04.112 --> 31:09.434
"I am too young and weak to stand
up to him, so I must flee.

31:10.869 --> 31:16.567
"Since the Vampire's Heart is the
only way to find me, I must take it.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.168
"I can only trust you,
Count Dracula,

31:19.169 --> 31:23.130
"to be its new guardian
until another Queen arises.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.884
"Meet me in the Fog of Doom,
where the Globe meets the Tower,

31:26.885 --> 31:30.410
"and I will leave another
note for you in the crown.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.583
"Elissabat."

31:34.518 --> 31:37.269
Wow! A major clue!

31:37.270 --> 31:39.480
But I don't get it. "Fog of Doom"?

31:39.481 --> 31:42.358
Here, Londoom!

31:42.359 --> 31:45.486
But I don't see
anything about a crown.

31:45.487 --> 31:48.739
Scooch over, ghoul,
crowns are my department.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.968
It's obvious she's talking
about the Crown Jewels

31:50.992 --> 31:53.244
in the Tower of Londoom.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.939
Come on, let's show
this to Draculaura!

32:04.005 --> 32:05.381
Um...

32:05.382 --> 32:08.736
Girls' bathroom. BRB, Lord Stoker.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.325
Make it quick!

32:14.766 --> 32:16.083
What did you find?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.351
Who the real Queen is!

32:17.352 --> 32:19.125
Elissabat!

32:19.187 --> 32:20.960
My old friend? No!

32:20.981 --> 32:23.691
Yes! And we know where she went!

32:23.692 --> 32:25.025
Londoom!

32:25.026 --> 32:27.862
My older sister, Clawdia, is
studying dramatic writing there!

32:27.863 --> 32:31.137
She knows Londoom like
the back of her paw!

32:31.700 --> 32:33.802
Enough of this!

32:33.869 --> 32:38.270
The vamp-bassadors await.
Ygor, fetch the Queen!

32:42.002 --> 32:47.233
My Queen, Ygor is to take
you to the vamp-bassadors.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.571
Just a sec!

32:53.054 --> 32:54.138
Ah ha!

32:54.139 --> 32:55.240
Hoodude?

32:55.265 --> 32:56.891
Hi, Draculaura!

32:56.892 --> 32:58.335
Come on!

33:03.356 --> 33:04.457
Uh...

33:04.733 --> 33:06.400
How do we get out of here?

33:06.401 --> 33:09.004
Below the castle there's
dock with a boat.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.598
We can sneak out to
Londoom on that!

33:12.115 --> 33:14.968
You are coming with Ygor!

33:16.953 --> 33:18.054
Uh-oh.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.565
Master will be angry.

33:21.082 --> 33:25.503
Where is the Queen, Stoker?
We are waiting.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.380
The monarchy must be restored!

33:28.381 --> 33:32.301
Stoker, you didn't
lie to us did you?

33:32.302 --> 33:34.496
Because you can be replaced!

33:36.973 --> 33:38.245
Uh, just a moment.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.122
What?

33:43.855 --> 33:49.944
The Queen has had a
makeup malfunction.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.922
Please, wait here.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.883
He he.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.100
Ta-da!

34:04.584 --> 34:07.586
- One escape boat.
- Ugh!

34:07.587 --> 34:11.966
It'll take us a century to get
to Londoom in that old thing!

34:11.967 --> 34:16.447
How about a steam ship?

34:17.472 --> 34:18.619
Cool!

34:20.976 --> 34:24.436
All aboard the SS Robecca!

34:24.437 --> 34:26.255
Let's go!

34:26.273 --> 34:28.649
It's not first class, but it'll do.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.217
Hang on, everyone!

34:32.654 --> 34:35.473
Our very own royal
vampire adventure!

34:35.489 --> 34:38.324
Oh, I'm just like
Veronica Von Vamp!

34:38.326 --> 34:40.554
Except, I'm a boy
and not a vampire.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.851
And no one's fighting over me...

34:42.956 --> 34:45.605
Can't you make this
thing go any faster?

34:46.001 --> 34:47.101
Whoa!

34:50.505 --> 34:53.215
Only four days until
the coronation!

34:53.216 --> 34:56.635
I hope I get to meet a vampire
prince like Alucard from the boovie.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.179
Oh! He is monstrously hot!

35:00.265 --> 35:02.474
Hot? So not.

35:02.475 --> 35:06.170
The cute one is
Prince Edweird, duh.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.127
Hey!

35:08.315 --> 35:13.068
What are they arguing about?
I can't even tell those dudes apart.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.921
And here's a picture of Elissabat.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.798
Thanks for the web search, Ghoulia.

35:16.865 --> 35:21.516
In the meantime, we're on
the way to Londoom! Laters!

35:21.536 --> 35:23.329
- Cheerio.
- Good.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.998
Draculaura isn't Queen,
which is bad for her,

35:25.999 --> 35:29.293
but she gets to come back to Monster
High, which is good for us.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.003
I don't know how to
feel about this.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.798
I don't think so, Ghoulia.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.947
It's better if people
don't know Draculaura's

35:36.968 --> 35:39.053
looking for the Vampire's Heart

35:39.054 --> 35:40.137
or Elissabat.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.333
Uh uh uh. Y'all know
I don't like secrets.

35:44.726 --> 35:45.952
Unless I'm in on 'em.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.212
Whatcha got?

35:58.490 --> 36:02.845
Londoom! Now we just have to find...

36:03.161 --> 36:06.856
Veronica! Ugh! I can't
seem get away from her!

36:06.873 --> 36:10.084
Ooh! They're making a
sequel to Vampire Majesty!

36:10.085 --> 36:13.420
We're on a quest for
real vampire royalty.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.547
Yeah, not some Hauntlywood phony

36:15.548 --> 36:18.572
who doesn't know a thing
about vampire scaritage.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.390
Robecca, come on.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.038
Oh, sorry, coming!

36:28.853 --> 36:33.357
My sis said she would meet us
here. At the Globe Theatre.

36:33.358 --> 36:38.112
Cool statue! This must be the
first ventriloquist act ever!

36:38.113 --> 36:42.783
That's no dummy.
That's William Spooks-Fear.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.558
He was the most famous
playwright ever.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.599
For 400 years he's
been inspiring actors,

36:48.623 --> 36:51.625
directors and writers, like me.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.960
Clawdia!

36:54.295 --> 36:56.630
Hey big sis! Thanks for helping!

36:56.631 --> 36:59.280
Sure! We wolves are
known for our loyalty.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.949
Come on, you're just
in time for the tour.

37:09.269 --> 37:13.715
But, Master, they
could be anywhere!

37:15.608 --> 37:16.709
Ah!

37:16.776 --> 37:20.801
Not anywhere, Londoom.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.926
Follow her and bring her back!

37:23.950 --> 37:27.771
If that ghoul flaps her fangs
about the Vampire's Heart...

37:27.787 --> 37:32.666
...my reign of power will be over!

37:32.667 --> 37:35.002
Yes, Master!

37:40.925 --> 37:43.886
Here it is, the crown.

37:43.887 --> 37:48.390
Uh! Not impressed.
I mean, where are the scarabs?

37:48.391 --> 37:51.185
Hmm. I don't see any clues.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.584
We're gonna need to
take a closer look.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.003
I have an idea, but it's tricky.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.967
Cleo, you keep watch
while Clawdia tells

37:58.026 --> 37:59.943
the guards she has
a thorn in her paw.

37:59.944 --> 38:03.238
Then Robecca will let out
a burst of steam to cover.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.364
And what do I do?

38:04.365 --> 38:06.888
Hoodude, you just wear the crown?

38:06.993 --> 38:08.094
Oh!

38:10.205 --> 38:11.306
Oi!

38:11.331 --> 38:13.650
That bloke is stealing
the Crown Jewels!

38:14.083 --> 38:15.209
Get him!

38:15.210 --> 38:17.153
- Hoodude!
- Ah!

38:22.717 --> 38:24.410
There's no clue in this crown!

38:24.636 --> 38:25.737
Huh?

38:27.847 --> 38:29.014
Oh, no!

38:30.975 --> 38:32.122
Oh, here you go!

38:33.269 --> 38:35.896
Sorry, guys. He thought
it was a souvenir.

38:37.148 --> 38:42.630
I told you the gift shop
is downstairs. Silly boy!

38:45.657 --> 38:50.684
This doesn't spin right. I could feel
that we were on the right track.

38:50.703 --> 38:53.121
What exactly was the clue?

38:53.122 --> 38:55.290
"Where the Globe meets the Tower,

38:55.291 --> 38:58.361
"I will leave another note
for you in the crown."

38:58.461 --> 38:59.562
Oh!

38:59.587 --> 39:03.157
Elissabat's not talking
about the Crown Jewels.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.570
She means that crown.
Back at the Globe Theatre.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.783
Oh!

39:08.972 --> 39:11.807
A crown can also mean
the top of the head.

39:11.808 --> 39:15.060
Or, more relevantly, a skull.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.396
I think I like the regular
kind of crowns better.

39:17.397 --> 39:23.550
I can't explain this, but I feel
like I've been here before.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.353
Wow!

39:37.458 --> 39:38.980
It's a map, and another note!

39:39.002 --> 39:40.524
Yay!

39:40.628 --> 39:42.129
"Count Dracula..."

39:42.130 --> 39:44.574
"It is too dangerous here.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.885
"I'm taking the Heart and
fleeing to the Boo World.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.971
"Here is the map to
my destination."

39:50.972 --> 39:53.291
New Goreleans!
My father took me there

39:53.308 --> 39:55.627
when I was just a little ghoul.

39:55.643 --> 39:59.730
And that's where my father lived
when I was under construction.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.648
She must have taken
the Heart there.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.358
We have to go find it!

40:03.359 --> 40:05.652
Next stop, New Goreleans!

40:05.653 --> 40:07.426
And I'm going with you.

40:07.488 --> 40:10.762
Really? That'd be
totes appreciated.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.681
Mom and Dad would shed their fur

40:12.702 --> 40:14.600
if I didn't keep an
eye on you ghouls.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.815
Besides, this will
make a great story

40:16.831 --> 40:19.059
someday and I'm gonna write it!

40:19.125 --> 40:21.148
Yeah! That's how you do it!

40:37.560 --> 40:40.789
Whatevs, flea bag!
Edweird is cuter!

40:41.064 --> 40:43.440
As if, litter lover.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.443
You can't see the obvious
awesomeness of Alucard?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.592
It's right in front of your face.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.322
Duh, yeah! Totally.

40:50.323 --> 40:53.597
See? Everybloody likes Alucard.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.369
Sorry, I'm on Team Edweird.

40:55.370 --> 40:58.455
There's just something special
there that Alucard doesn't have.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.309
I don't even know which
one you're talking about.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.482
How 'bout you, Twyla?

41:03.503 --> 41:05.253
Who do you like?

41:05.254 --> 41:08.483
Come on, looks don't
make the monster.

41:08.549 --> 41:13.220
I can't just crush on a shadow I've
only seen on the silver scream.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.430
I mean, it's what's in
his heart that counts.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.330
You can't judge a bat
by its wings, right?

41:18.893 --> 41:22.167
Okay, officially, ignoring you now.

41:22.230 --> 41:25.273
Anyway, Edweird, purr-fect!

41:25.274 --> 41:26.751
Yeah. He's purr-fect.

41:26.776 --> 41:27.901
He's gorgeous.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.903
Na-uh! Alucard all the way.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.530
He's way better.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.656
Oh! The cutest.

41:36.703 --> 41:39.352
No one else thinks they look alike?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.850
Hooray!

41:41.874 --> 41:43.442
I can't wait to get
to New Goreleans!

41:51.843 --> 41:53.320
- Wow! Look at that.
- Fancy

41:53.344 --> 41:55.867
Now these monsters
know how to party!

42:03.730 --> 42:04.831
Ah!

42:18.453 --> 42:22.706
Master, they've arrived
in New Goreleans.

42:22.707 --> 42:25.230
If they locate the Vampire's Heart,

42:25.251 --> 42:27.729
then they can find
the rightful Queen.

42:27.795 --> 42:31.423
We cannot let that happen.
You know what to do.

42:31.424 --> 42:36.155
Yes, Master, I won't
let you down. Oops!

42:36.971 --> 42:38.539
Ygor? Ygor!

42:40.683 --> 42:42.877
Sorry, Master.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.318
There's nothing here.

42:51.319 --> 42:54.613
Maybe this old map is out
of date or something.

42:54.614 --> 42:59.094
No. The answer is here,
I can feel it.

42:59.118 --> 43:02.939
I think somebody needs to
have their gears checked.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.524
Wow!

43:13.549 --> 43:14.821
Ghost ship!

43:16.969 --> 43:18.720
Awesome, right?

43:18.721 --> 43:20.289
Yay!

43:21.891 --> 43:23.083
What is this place?

43:23.101 --> 43:24.293
Gorgeous.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.603
Oh, my Ra.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.230
I've read about this ship.

43:28.231 --> 43:32.400
It was a floating theater
called the Bijou on the Bayou.

43:32.401 --> 43:35.300
Check out all the old
props and scripts.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.135
Oh, yay!

43:41.911 --> 43:46.456
You know, every place Elissabat
tried to meet with my Dad

43:46.457 --> 43:48.980
had to do with a theater.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.425
Uh...

43:57.426 --> 44:00.530
Ghouls, I think you
should look at this.

44:00.555 --> 44:04.558
We don't have any time to
watch your dance...

44:04.559 --> 44:05.660
What is it?

44:06.185 --> 44:08.061
Sweet suffering swamp moss!

44:08.062 --> 44:10.039
Hey, y'all are in my shot.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.773
Who are you?

44:11.774 --> 44:13.358
I'm Honey Swamp.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.235
Pleased to make
y'all's acquaintance.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.736
What are you doing here?

44:16.737 --> 44:21.950
I'm making my student film about the
famous Bijou on the Bayou theater.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.412
We're looking for an ancient,
valuable artifact.

44:25.413 --> 44:26.893
Do you think it might
be on the Bijou?

44:27.540 --> 44:29.813
Well, so many great actors, writers

44:29.834 --> 44:32.107
and directors have toured through.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.881
Ya know, the boovie star
Veronica Von Vamp

44:35.882 --> 44:38.405
gave her first performance here!

44:38.843 --> 44:40.010
Ain't she a peach?

44:40.011 --> 44:41.237
Oh, yes.

44:41.470 --> 44:42.617
No, not a fan.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.278
Oh, no!

44:58.279 --> 45:00.030
We can't go back without the Heart!

45:00.031 --> 45:01.489
Ygor good!

45:01.490 --> 45:04.284
Ygor bring the ghouls
to you, Master.

45:04.285 --> 45:06.479
Excellent, Ygor.

45:06.537 --> 45:11.234
Don't worry, ghouls.
I got friends in low places.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.300
Come on. Y'all go first.

45:20.301 --> 45:22.324
I wanna catch this on film!

45:23.262 --> 45:26.491
Low angle, track the action and...

45:27.767 --> 45:28.914
Cut!

45:31.938 --> 45:35.482
Ygor, you brainless
lunk! Stop them!

45:35.483 --> 45:37.256
Yes, Master.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.445
Huh?

46:06.889 --> 46:09.287
I'm sorry about the
Bijou on the Bayou.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.434
It ain't nothing to
worry about, y'all.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.103
It's a ghost ship.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.356
It'll rise up again on
the next full moon.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.650
So we have to wait a whole month

46:18.651 --> 46:22.506
to find out if the Vampire's
Heart was even on the ship?

46:22.530 --> 46:25.699
Didn't anyone see anything
remotely resembling a clue?

46:25.700 --> 46:28.994
Whoa! Hold on there! Let's rewind.

46:28.995 --> 46:32.205
I took some amazing shots
of the Bijou on the Bayou.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.353
Let's check the footage!

46:33.958 --> 46:37.153
There! That wax seal,
it's Elissabat's!

46:39.880 --> 46:43.758
"Lord Dracula, as long
as I have the Vampire's Heart..."

46:43.759 --> 46:46.511
"Its glow will lead others to me.

46:46.512 --> 46:49.991
"I cannot wait any longer,
so I am steaming onwards.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.601
"I have found someone
we both trust,

46:53.602 --> 46:55.170
"an eternal friend,

46:55.563 --> 46:57.605
"and given to their care..."

46:57.606 --> 46:59.458
"...the Vampire's Heart."

46:59.483 --> 47:00.584
Oh!

47:00.901 --> 47:03.424
The Heart could be anywhere.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.381
This is a wild ghost chase.

47:05.740 --> 47:08.389
I can't stop Lord Stoker.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.703
So much for helping vampire-kind.

47:11.704 --> 47:16.105
Wait a minute. In literature,
everything has a reason, a purpose.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.251
Nothing is coincidence.

47:18.252 --> 47:22.088
If I were writing this,
I would use a literary device.

47:22.089 --> 47:26.490
Foreshadowing or symbolism perhaps.

47:26.510 --> 47:30.263
Or what about just
putting it on a poster?

47:30.264 --> 47:34.517
Well, not super subtle, but I
guess if it served the story...

47:34.518 --> 47:36.962
No. There, on the poster!

47:37.772 --> 47:40.357
Veronica Von Vamp!

47:40.358 --> 47:41.566
Oh!

47:41.567 --> 47:43.276
The Vampire's Heart!

47:43.277 --> 47:44.629
In the boovie?

47:44.820 --> 47:47.389
My wheels are clicking.

47:47.782 --> 47:52.327
Elissabat must have given
the Heart to Veronica.

47:52.328 --> 47:55.398
They were both here in New
Goreleans at the same time.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.791
Whoa, whoa! Confused here.

47:57.792 --> 48:01.795
Why would my dad trust that
vamp-poseur, Veronica?

48:01.796 --> 48:02.837
One way to find out.

48:02.838 --> 48:06.257
I do believe Honey Swamp and
I are thinking the same thing.

48:06.258 --> 48:09.344
Uh-huh. Time to take this story to

48:09.345 --> 48:10.929
- Hauntlywood!
- Hauntlywood!

48:12.181 --> 48:13.502
- Hauntlywood!
- Let's go, ghouls!

48:24.110 --> 48:27.134
Wow! They're off to Hauntlywood!

48:27.363 --> 48:29.239
This is so exciting!

48:29.240 --> 48:31.950
I wonder if they will see
any boovie stars. Like...

48:31.951 --> 48:33.368
- Alucard!
- Edweird!

48:33.369 --> 48:35.245
- Alucard!
- Edweird!

48:35.246 --> 48:36.329
Alucard!

48:36.330 --> 48:37.414
Edweird!

48:39.583 --> 48:44.879
Ghoulia right, this "which boy is
cuter" argument is totes cray-cray.

48:44.880 --> 48:49.509
We better do something or it's the
Ghostfields and McFangs all over again!

48:51.053 --> 48:53.179
Don't they seem the
same to you guys?

48:53.180 --> 48:54.782
Nyeh. Can't tell them apart.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.349
Couple of dudes.

48:56.350 --> 49:00.854
How dare you compare
Alucard to Edweird?

49:00.855 --> 49:02.923
He looks like he has bat breath!

49:02.940 --> 49:04.941
Those are fighting words!

49:14.285 --> 49:15.978
Now that I got your attention,

49:15.995 --> 49:19.565
I gotta say, this has gone too far.

49:19.707 --> 49:21.184
Yeah, cool it!

49:21.333 --> 49:22.876
Now back in Gnarlston,

49:22.877 --> 49:26.481
we solve our differences by having
a good old-fashioned trial.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.200
We settle this in Cute Court.

49:35.055 --> 49:39.642
Hauntlywood, get ready to
meet Monster High!

49:41.228 --> 49:46.274
Come on! Let's find that star that leads
to the Queen of the silver scream!

49:46.275 --> 49:48.234
And action!

49:48.235 --> 49:52.806
Fun, fun, fun
Hauntlywood, here we come

49:54.074 --> 49:55.533
Let's have some fun

49:55.534 --> 50:00.079
Fun, fun, fun
Hauntlywood, here we come

50:00.080 --> 50:02.433
Where my Ghouls at?
Hey, hey, hey

50:02.666 --> 50:06.316
Black carpet, moonlight

50:06.337 --> 50:09.532
So excited screams
come true tonight

50:10.591 --> 50:13.069
Frights so bright
and cameras flashin'

50:13.260 --> 50:17.365
Here we come
Frights, camera, action

50:19.141 --> 50:23.853
Fun, fun, fun
Hauntlywood, here we come

50:23.854 --> 50:26.924
Here we come

50:28.734 --> 50:31.194
Hello. We're looking
for Veronica Von Vamp.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.387
Name.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.724
We just told you. Veronica Von...

50:35.783 --> 50:38.868
No, ya big pin cushion, your name.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.286
Oh.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.934
Hoodude Voodoo.

50:42.623 --> 50:46.728
Nope, not on the list. Thanks
for stoppin' by. Buh-bye.

50:47.294 --> 50:49.362
I got this.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.573
Name?

50:51.632 --> 50:56.970
No! You give me your name
because I am Cleo de Nile!

50:56.971 --> 50:59.430
That's de Nile as in the de Niles.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.807
And one call to my father

51:00.808 --> 51:03.935
and I'll have you transferred to
the night shift in Fright-beria

51:03.936 --> 51:07.415
for the next 100 years if you don't
open that gate this instant!

51:07.439 --> 51:09.899
Uh, um... Yes, ma'am, I mean...

51:09.900 --> 51:11.526
Miss de Nile!

51:11.527 --> 51:13.095
Right away! Here you go.

51:14.822 --> 51:17.115
I am impressed.

51:17.116 --> 51:20.516
Yeah, being a diva is
like Cleo's super power.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.331
Okay, ghouls, it's a big lot.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.333
Let's try to find
Veronica fast before...

51:27.334 --> 51:29.836
Anybody realizes we
don't belong here.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.314
Yeah, that.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.907
Hauntlywood?

51:41.557 --> 51:46.269
Why would the Heart be in
that den of mediocrity?

51:46.270 --> 51:50.796
No decent vampire would dare
take it to such a place.

51:50.858 --> 51:57.136
I heard the Vampire Majesty
boovies are clawsome!

51:57.489 --> 52:02.577
I would really like to
see my first boovie

52:02.578 --> 52:04.370
if you...

52:04.371 --> 52:06.706
I will fly out immediately.

52:06.707 --> 52:11.127
Then we will bring Draculaura
back to be my puppet Queen,

52:11.128 --> 52:14.823
and I shall remain
in charge forever!

52:19.053 --> 52:21.997
I have her now.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.587
O-M-Ghoul! Is that?

52:29.938 --> 52:33.963
Yes! The famous
die-rector, Scareantino!

52:37.237 --> 52:38.463
Hey! Watch out!

52:41.992 --> 52:45.392
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!

52:46.830 --> 52:49.248
Mr. Scareantino! I wasn't looking.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.022
Nice going, Viperine!

52:55.130 --> 52:58.860
Gear me, I... I am fading to black.

52:59.635 --> 53:01.112
Let me wind that for you.

53:04.598 --> 53:07.058
Opening shot! Zombies to the left!
Zombies to the right!

53:07.059 --> 53:09.268
Cue the music!
Enter the hero! But who?

53:09.269 --> 53:11.854
Hmm. Gotta dig up some old star
and resurrect their career!

53:11.855 --> 53:13.773
Note to self,
pack a shovel. Ninjas!

53:13.774 --> 53:16.609
Why didn't I think of that?
Put it in the movie!

53:16.610 --> 53:19.714
Oh no. No, no, no!
I can't be late again.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.924
I'll get fired from
the boovie for sure!

53:23.325 --> 53:25.393
Looks like you could use a hand.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.888
And a paw or two.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.603
I got your scare-spray right here.

53:30.749 --> 53:33.693
Thank you so much! I am Viperine.

53:33.877 --> 53:36.571
I owe you guys, big time!

53:38.340 --> 53:39.737
All rise.

53:40.509 --> 53:44.079
The honorable Judge
Twyla is presiding.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.784
Cute Court is now in session.

53:48.976 --> 53:51.625
Each side will now make
a case for their hunk.

53:51.979 --> 53:55.606
Your Honor, Alucard's
adorable face and great smile

53:55.607 --> 53:57.425
makes him clearly
the cuter monster.

53:58.986 --> 54:04.013
If you want purr-fect face, you
just have to look at Edweird.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.285
Pale skin, blue eyes.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.478
Objection!

54:09.037 --> 54:12.482
The boovie is black and white,
you don't know the color!

54:12.583 --> 54:15.501
And you wouldn't know cute
if it bit you on the neck!

54:15.502 --> 54:16.945
Alucard is the cute one!

54:17.004 --> 54:18.421
Edweird is hideous!

54:18.422 --> 54:20.775
Order! Order!

54:20.883 --> 54:23.217
I still say they look the same.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.677
Can't tell the dudes apart.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.576
Yeah. Dudes.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.124
Whoa! Oof!

54:33.312 --> 54:36.086
Okay, I'm good! I'm good!

54:37.107 --> 54:38.524
Oops, missed!

54:38.525 --> 54:41.879
Hey, could you throw that in
with the other typewriters?

54:42.196 --> 54:43.513
In creative frustration?

54:43.697 --> 54:44.864
Sure.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.224
Sorry about that.

54:50.662 --> 54:52.639
Just going through a
little writer's block.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.290
It can't be!

54:54.291 --> 54:59.238
That's Scary Stone, the most amazing
scream-writer in Hauntlywood!

55:00.464 --> 55:04.159
Ms. Stone, if you
have writer's block,

55:04.510 --> 55:06.988
my friend Clawdia is a writer.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.596
She can help.

55:09.723 --> 55:10.949
This new werewolf movie?

55:11.099 --> 55:12.542
It is chewing me up.

55:20.567 --> 55:25.468
You've changed the
"Wwwwwwooooa!" to "Aoooooowwww!"

55:25.531 --> 55:29.602
So authentic, so raw, so wolfy!

55:29.618 --> 55:30.719
It's brilliant!

55:30.744 --> 55:32.938
You have got to help me with
the rest of the script!

55:33.080 --> 55:37.435
Wow! It's always been my scream
to be a writer in Hauntlywood.

55:37.543 --> 55:39.862
See you later! Write lots of words!

55:40.420 --> 55:42.397
Oh, goodbye guys,
I hope you find the... Whoa!

55:43.257 --> 55:44.423
- Have fun!
- Oh, do have fun!

55:44.424 --> 55:45.525
Okay. Bye, bye.

55:54.309 --> 55:56.377
Where is camera two?

55:57.020 --> 55:58.622
My underwater camera?

56:02.359 --> 56:05.713
Really, made of stone?
That's your excuse!

56:08.115 --> 56:12.220
Oh, come on, I can't make this
without underwater footage!

56:12.786 --> 56:15.856
Excuse me, I think I
know who can help.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.194
Go on! This is your scream!

56:20.335 --> 56:25.236
Yup! There's nobody better if you're
talking about a camera and a swamp!

56:25.591 --> 56:29.635
Why I can rack a focus while changing
lenses on a backtracked Steadicam.

56:29.636 --> 56:30.737
Whoa.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.740
What does that even mean?

56:34.308 --> 56:36.581
All right, I'll try you out.

56:38.979 --> 56:40.296
You go, ghoul!

56:40.314 --> 56:41.666
She's going to be great.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.709
And action!

56:54.536 --> 56:55.933
And cut!

56:56.455 --> 56:58.148
I love it, I love it!

57:04.922 --> 57:06.865
I'm looking for a triple threat!

57:07.090 --> 57:09.967
Where we gonna find someone
with the pure raw talent

57:09.968 --> 57:11.427
to handle this part?

57:11.428 --> 57:12.996
You wanna triple threat?

57:13.221 --> 57:14.472
Here I am.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.371
I sing!

57:17.267 --> 57:18.744
I dance!

57:23.148 --> 57:25.626
Jazz hands! And I act.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.670
Skulla!

57:30.364 --> 57:31.511
You got the job!

57:32.157 --> 57:33.258
Hooray!

57:36.745 --> 57:39.064
- Hoodude, even your scream came true!
- Awesome!

57:40.374 --> 57:44.775
In Hauntlywood, triple threat
means dust, mop, sweep.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.883
Oh, well, at least I'm in showbiz!

57:50.884 --> 57:52.577
Ha cha cha!

57:57.516 --> 57:59.835
Let me get this straight,

58:00.060 --> 58:03.004
you say dimples are better
than a chiseled chin?

58:03.397 --> 58:05.170
No, chiseled chin!

58:05.273 --> 58:07.091
No, dimples are better!

58:08.068 --> 58:13.641
Ghoulia, what does science say about
dimples versus chiseled chins?

58:24.167 --> 58:26.565
Wait, are you telling us

58:28.088 --> 58:30.236
that they are the same actor!

58:30.674 --> 58:34.324
Digitally composites! to seem
like two different boys?

58:35.262 --> 58:36.909
No way.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.623
What an unexpected development.

58:41.309 --> 58:42.911
Twice as delicious.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.126
Order in the court!

58:46.857 --> 58:48.504
Order in the court!

58:50.986 --> 58:53.904
In the case of Alucard
versus Edweird,

58:53.905 --> 58:58.476
I find that you can't
judge a bat by its wings!

58:58.618 --> 58:59.719
Case closed!

59:00.120 --> 59:02.663
Cute Court is hereby adjourned!

59:04.416 --> 59:06.109
Totally called it!

59:06.126 --> 59:07.853
Yep, same dude.

59:07.961 --> 59:10.780
I knew it! And they
called me crazy!

59:10.797 --> 59:13.446
Oh, they actually did, you know.

59:13.925 --> 59:16.244
Okay, I guess dimples are cute.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.581
And I could see getting
used to a chiseled chin.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.241
What is it, Ghoulia?

59:27.397 --> 59:30.171
Couldn't be, could it?

59:33.653 --> 59:36.614
We're close, ghouls, I can feel it.

59:36.615 --> 59:38.092
This way.

59:41.161 --> 59:42.262
Wow.

59:43.830 --> 59:44.931
Huh?

59:46.041 --> 59:47.814
Veronica Von Vamp.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.321
We have to get into that trailer!

59:51.338 --> 59:56.569
Oh! That'll be easy, except for
those two huge bodyguards.

59:57.010 --> 59:59.238
"Looks like you could use a hand."

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.471
Viperine?

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.764
You work on this boovie?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:05.290
Yeah. Thanks to you,
I didn't get fired.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.520
Can you help us meet Veronica?

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.544
Leave it to me.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.966
Viperine, plus makeup crew.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.839
How come so many of you?

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.697
We have to make Miss Von Vamp

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.677
very, very, very, very, very,
pretty for her next scene!

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.641
Uh, yes, ma'am.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.685
She's not here.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.487
Well, then I guess we wait.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:36.734
A trailer this classy
shouldn't be wasted.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.869
No! I can't rest until we find her.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.163
Do I know you?

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:44.974
The Vampire's Heart!

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.058
It's here!

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:51.564
Sorry, you're looking at a
fake, this is Hauntlywood.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.757
It's only a prop.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.568
We're very sorry for
intruding like this, but...

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.172
Well, I can always sign
an autograph for a fan.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.850
Uh, sorry, not actually a fan.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:06.704
In fact, I think that your
stereotypical portrayal...

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.186
Not the time!

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.894
Now, you tell me,

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:13.820
why are you looking for it?

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.778
Because the Heart will
lead us to Elissabat,

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.526
the rightful Queen of the vampires.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.864
Wow, I haven't heard that
name in a long time.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.680
The vampires need a Queen.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.599
Quickly. And Lord Stoker chose me,

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.934
but then I found out that his
Vampire's Heart was a fake,

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.519
so I decided to find the real one

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.966
so it could lead me to the real
Queen, who is, in reality, Elissabat!

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.002
So, I need help.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.429
What if she doesn't
want to be the Queen?

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:44.597
Everything we stand for will
be undone if Stoker rules.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.928
The vampires need her.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.768
All monsters need her.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:52.351
If Elissabat were here,

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:56.086
she would probably say that she's
just one ghoul, nothing special,

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:59.862
and maybe she doesn't think she
has what's needed to be Queen.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:04.283
I get that. It takes
courage, heart.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.263
And I know she has it.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:10.085
Listen, not all of us were
meant to do great things.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:15.507
She should be proud that she was
born to do something so amazing.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:19.424
Look, I want to help, really, I do.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:24.349
But I promised Elissabat that
I would keep her secret.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.935
Then, you can you tell her,
from Draculaura,

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:29.475
and this is big, that
she ran away once,

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:34.105
but I will find her, that
I will never give up.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.352
Why?

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.858
This is how I can help.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.733
How I can do something big.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.284
Something important!

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:47.539
And when she's Queen,
she can help everybloody.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.618
This is a turning point
in vampire history,

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:56.715
and her duty calls, to
help monsters everywhere!

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.803
Ready on the set, Miss Von Vamp.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:05.136
I must go.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.930
Please, Miss Von Vamp,

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:12.272
if you know where Elissabat
is, you have to tell her.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.567
Elissabat disappeared
a long time ago.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:20.818
I want to help, but...

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:28.304
Fur-rific. The Heart's a fake, and
Veronica's not gonna help us.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.722
What are we gonna do now?

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:33.828
I'm sorry, it seemed
like you were so close.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.209
Yes. Elissabat is close.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:38.836
I can sense it.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:42.211
Then we keep looking. Come on!

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:52.012
I've got you, Your Highness.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.430
No!

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.734
My Queen is found at last.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:03.694
Is this in the script?

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.495
Now, this is how it will be.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:11.490
You will return to Transylvania.

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.682
You will take your
place at the court.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.934
And you will obey me.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.333
I love the gritty realism!
Keep rolling!

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:21.750
No! I am so close to
finding Elissabat!

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:26.028
Ha! She is gone, and you will be
Queen whether you want to or...

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.348
I think not!

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.059
I insist.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.561
And what gives you the authority?

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.690
I am the Prime Monister
of all the vampires.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:41.862
And I am Veronica Von
Vamp, boovie star.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:44.906
And you are in my studio.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.237
I protest!

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.634
I have never been
treated like this.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:52.054
Well, then, it is long overdue.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:57.290
Draculaura, your people need you.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.754
No! They need the true Queen.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.166
Monsters everywhere
are counting on her.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.959
I am counting on her.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:07.216
You won't be able to boss
her around! No way!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.758
Well, hard to say. She's not here!

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:14.887
You will not use
that tone on my set.

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:17.663
Guards!

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:22.770
Veronica, if you know where
Elissabat is, please, please, help.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.279
You know where...

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.734
Draculaura is right.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:31.787
It is time. The vampires need
their real Queen, Elissabat.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.034
Ghoulia?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.205
Yeah! Veronica is talking
about Elissabat!

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.292
Veronica is...

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.837
What? Say again?

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:53.599
I remember Elissabat, who, more
than anything, wanted to act.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.599
Only on stage,
and in her imagination,

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.268
did she have the strength to lead.

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.141
But my friend Draculaura

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:04.857
has reminded me that you
need to have courage

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:10.507
to face your fear, to
overcome it, to help others.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.633
I did?

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:16.240
Yes, this is a turning
point in monster history.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:17.681
Did she tell ya?

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:18.724
No, no what?

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.125
It is time to raise the
curtain on a new act.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:27.467
Veronica Von Vamp is,
and always was...

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:29.506
That's right.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:31.720
I am...

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.805
Elissabat?

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.488
The Queen of the vampires!

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.132
I knew she was close!

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.031
Yup. She fooled us.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.719
Just goes to show...

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.165
You can't judge a bat by its wings.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.038
That's right!

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:04.746
Robecca, take my hand.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.273
Oh.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.528
Whoa!

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.006
Amazing.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.761
- Oh!
- Bleh!

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:22.852
I gave the Vampire's Heart to your
father, Hexiciah Steam, to keep safe.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:26.188
So he put it in the
safest place of all.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:29.396
It led you ghouls to me.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:34.359
Lord Stoker, for your crimes
against the vampire crown,

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:38.239
you are banished from ever
holding official office.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.082
Boys, show him the street.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.375
But I'm the boss of everything.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.188
Ygor!

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.290
Master!

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:53.378
Hooray!

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:59.309
Tonight is my new boovie premiere,

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.854
it will also be my coronation.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.306
And you are all invited.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:10.024
And cut! That's a wrap!
Off to the edit bay!

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.885
This is Spectra Vondergeist,
blogging to you live

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:21.513
from the famous Hauntlywood
Groaning's theater

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:24.709
for the premiere of Veronica
Von Vamp's new boovie.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.773
I am being told via telepath
that the star of the boovie,

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:35.299
Veronica Von Vamp, is arriving now.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:44.062
With her is Draculaura.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.060
What an entrance.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.663
Whoa! Ooh!

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.939
Oh, Miss Von Vamp, may
I have your autograph?

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.819
I'm so flattered.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.611
Would you honor me
by being my date?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.066
Huzza!

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.703
Draculaura! She's here!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.581
Draculaura!

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:13.231
Clawd?

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.332
Draculaura!

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.426
Oh, Clawd, I missed you so much!

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.783
Do you like that? Good boy! You
missed your ear being scratched.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:23.885
Oh!

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:30.312
I don't think so.
You're not on the list.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.334
Oh! I, uh...

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:37.191
I just wanted to be the first one
to congratulate Her Majesty,

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.238
my niece, the Queen.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:45.786
Yeah, how about when trolls fly.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.217
I, um, just wanted
to see the boovie.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.843
Clawsome!

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:06.993
Veronica, in recognition of
your dead-ication to acting,

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.370
the members of the Boovie Academy

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.123
are proud to present you
with the Silver Claw!

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.102
Thank you.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:19.490
You know, I have made boovies
about the Vampire Court,

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.411
but I have never before revealed
that I actually grew up there.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:26.471
I would like to
dead-icate this award

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.075
to the person who made
this evening possible.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:32.920
So this is for my
friend, Draculaura,

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.754
who taught me that you need
to think beyond yourself,

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.093
in order to really help others.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.136
At this turning point in Vampire
history, my duty calls to me,

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:49.161
and I am here to help
monsters everywhere!

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.027
What's happening?

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.639
Draculaura, you got
your vamp-powers!

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.957
You did it!

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.935
Ghoulia's right!

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:18.507
Finding Elissabat and saving the
vampires was your big thing.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.880
Hey, what are we waiting for?

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.947
The boovie is about to start,

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.158
with my favorite royal actress,

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:30.307
Veronica Von Vamp!

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:41.030
So you're Elissabat playing Veronica
playing all of those parts!

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.326
You have to be the
greatest boovie star ever!

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:50.096
Thanks. I can't wait to make the
next sequel at Castle Dracool

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:54.247
with my new screenwriter,
cinematographer and makeup artist.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.667
Is this seat taken?

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.251
Look at that chin!

01:11:58.397 --> 01:11:59.773
He's sitting with me!

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.691
Wow! Dimples!

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.151
He's sitting with me!

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:09.516
Chill, ghouls,
hunk sitting with me.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:13.308
Hush, everyone,
the boovie's startin'!

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.899
Not all of us were meant
to do great things.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:26.276
She should be proud that she was
born to do something so amazing.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:28.301
I told her that!

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.821
Sorry!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.338
Hoodude Voodoo
scream-test take one!

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.752
I'm singin' in a stain!

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.695
Just singing and flinging!

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.196
And singing...

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.719
Ah!

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.807
Hoodude Voodoo scream-test take 47!

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:58.582
There you are, my
precious Vampire Heart!

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:03.109
No! That's not ours!
We needs to gives it back.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:07.090
No! Get away! It's all mine!

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.633
Uh-oh.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.468
I'm sorry. Is it broken?

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:11.661
Was it a real heart?

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:16.075
Hoodude Voodoo
scream-test take 752.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.326
Argh!

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.727
Rampage!

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.080
Ar rar rar rar!

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.256
Oh, the humanity!

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:24.959
Oh!

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.766
Okay, can I do that take over again?
I wasn't feeling that one.
