00:23.293 --> 00:24.726
Ho ho ho.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.471
All right, class,
if a reindeer leaves Elfsburg

01:05.559 --> 01:07.515
flying west at 20 miles per hour,

01:07.598 --> 01:11.192
and another reindeer flies east
travelling at 50 miles per hour,

01:11.277 --> 01:14.825
how many hours does it take
for them to be 210 miles apart?

01:16.636 --> 01:17.954
Anyone?

01:19.754 --> 01:22.632
Anyone?

01:23.393 --> 01:25.065
Trish.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.302
How come we can't learn
things we want to?

01:27.392 --> 01:29.302
- Like what?
- Like...

01:29.391 --> 01:32.700
Was it weird when you married Santa
and had to move up to the Pole

01:32.790 --> 01:34.428
and give up your old life?

01:34.510 --> 01:37.387
Weirder than you can
possibly imagine.

01:37.469 --> 01:39.982
But then something
so gigantic happened

01:40.068 --> 01:42.137
that it changed
Santa and me forever.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.626
Like what?

01:45.906 --> 01:47.258
OK.

01:47.345 --> 01:49.063
Baby Claus is on the way.

01:49.145 --> 01:52.102
Ladies, keep up.
Please, hot water and hot ointments.

01:52.184 --> 01:54.378
You, think sugar plums.
Do not panic!

01:54.463 --> 01:56.021
Do not panic!

01:56.103 --> 01:59.174
- Curtis, the baby's coming.
- Cocoa, the baby's coming.

01:59.262 --> 02:02.014
- Mrs Claus, the baby's coming.
- I know!

02:10.138 --> 02:11.366
Deep breaths.

02:12.297 --> 02:14.094
That's gonna leave a mark.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.121
Push.

02:32.771 --> 02:34.725
Oh.

02:34.809 --> 02:37.276
- Oh, Scott.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

02:37.368 --> 02:40.677
- Where's Dr Hismus?
- Oh, oh, Scott.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.279
I'm right here, babe.

02:42.366 --> 02:44.163
I'm right here. It's all right.

02:44.246 --> 02:46.076
Honey, it was a false alarm.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.723
Again?

02:47.805 --> 02:49.920
I stopped a pedicure for this?

03:04.599 --> 03:06.476
Scott! Scott, come here.

03:06.558 --> 03:08.753
Come here just for a second. Come here.

03:08.838 --> 03:12.034
Scott, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

03:12.117 --> 03:14.027
OK.

03:16.235 --> 03:18.066
Ready? Wait for the kick.

03:22.313 --> 03:23.587
- He's a genius.
- He?

03:23.673 --> 03:26.311
She. She's brilliant like her mother,

03:26.392 --> 03:29.383
- with rhythm like her dad.
- Yes. But not amazing timing.

03:29.471 --> 03:31.586
I wish the baby
had come this afternoon,

03:31.670 --> 03:33.388
or last week like we thought.

03:33.470 --> 03:35.778
I'm going crazy.
I'm really going crazy.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.540
- You need a diversion.
- No, no, Scott.

03:40.627 --> 03:43.140
No more gifts.
You already gave me a necklace,

03:43.226 --> 03:45.979
- oven mitts, the cheese wheel.
- This is not for you.

03:46.066 --> 03:48.579
This is for the baby.
I'll be back in a jiff.

03:50.384 --> 03:52.738
Ho ho!

03:52.823 --> 03:56.497
Ho!

03:56.582 --> 03:59.698
- Ho!
- That never gets old.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.340
OK, now what do we have
in the bag for a baby?

04:02.420 --> 04:05.616
Well, oddly enough,
we have a baby bag.

04:05.699 --> 04:07.689
And inside that baby bag,

04:07.778 --> 04:09.655
let's see what it is...
We have...

04:11.057 --> 04:12.570
Oh.

04:12.657 --> 04:16.933
Oh, Scott! Oh, honey,
it's beautiful!

04:17.015 --> 04:18.812
The baby's gonna love it.

04:18.894 --> 04:21.010
Yeah. It spins around like this.

04:22.773 --> 04:25.526
Oh. Later. Come on in.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.887
- Hey, doc.
- Dr Hismus, I'm glad you could come.

04:28.971 --> 04:30.120
How are you today?

04:30.211 --> 04:33.202
I'm a little concerned
because the baby hasn't come yet.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.769
No need to worry, Mrs Claus.

04:34.850 --> 04:39.046
Santa! Production has been so behind
we need you on the floor immediately.

04:39.128 --> 04:43.325
I can't come down now. It's impossible.
I'm still mapping out the sleigh route.

04:43.407 --> 04:46.603
- Got plenty of work here.
- Have you checked this list once?

04:46.686 --> 04:49.438
- I perused it.
- Help me help you. Help me help you.

04:49.525 --> 04:51.754
Let's start with
your blood pressure, OK?

04:51.844 --> 04:55.233
Help me help you,
help you help you help me,

04:55.323 --> 04:58.075
- help me help you.
- Don't be nervous.

04:58.162 --> 05:01.949
- It'll be done before you know it.
- Help you help me help you... help me.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.268
Help you.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.876
One more thing. The Council of Legendary
Figures called an emergency meeting.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.472
I can't leave the North Pole
and go to a meeting.

05:11.558 --> 05:13.707
- They know. That's why they came.
- Here?

05:13.797 --> 05:16.105
- Where? In the kitchen?
- In the kitchen.

05:16.196 --> 05:19.107
- Is there an echo in here?
- OK, OK. You know what?

05:19.195 --> 05:21.469
Sweetheart, I'm feeling so much better.

05:21.554 --> 05:25.751
I think that I'm going to go...
on a walk, which is great for the baby.

05:25.833 --> 05:29.586
You stay here and have
your blood pressure taken,

05:29.672 --> 05:33.458
which is great, and I'm gonna go see
what's down the hall.

05:40.348 --> 05:41.861
Hi, ladies.

05:43.387 --> 05:44.786
Honey?

05:45.906 --> 05:47.180
Honey.

05:49.065 --> 05:51.373
- Carol.
- Anything I can do for you, ma'am?

05:51.464 --> 05:53.056
No, thanks.

05:55.303 --> 05:57.941
- Care for some company?
- Not from you, Mr Claus.

05:58.022 --> 06:00.058
- Why not?
- You can't spend time with me

06:00.142 --> 06:02.575
and get toys ready,
I understand completely.

06:02.661 --> 06:04.651
- You do?
- Of course I do.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.288
I just hope you're not delivering
when I'm delivering.

06:09.459 --> 06:11.255
I'm not gonna let that happen.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.168
Carol, there's no way I could...

06:13.257 --> 06:16.328
Nice chrome work, Lenny.
That is so workin'!

06:16.416 --> 06:18.611
- Thanks, Santa.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

06:18.695 --> 06:19.810
All right.

06:21.135 --> 06:24.410
Look, I know this is all
a bit overwhelming to you,

06:24.494 --> 06:26.211
but... wait a minute. Stop.

06:26.293 --> 06:28.931
Did you see this?
Amazing technology.

06:29.012 --> 06:31.923
Look at this. It's a duck.
It quacks in three languages.

06:32.011 --> 06:33.649
<i>El ducko says "quacko."</i>

06:33.731 --> 06:36.642
<i>Le duck says "quack."
II duck-e say "quack-e."</i>

06:36.730 --> 06:38.799
Things can't help me right now.

06:38.889 --> 06:42.039
<i>- Hey, come back-e.
- It's people that I need.</i>

06:42.128 --> 06:44.277
You know, family.

06:44.367 --> 06:46.561
Ho ho ho ho! Family?

06:46.646 --> 06:49.398
We are your family.
Elves, we're her family, right?

06:49.485 --> 06:53.079
We love you, Mrs Claus.

06:54.044 --> 06:55.760
Taller family.

07:00.401 --> 07:01.833
Human family.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.388
Oh, sweetheart, anything but the tears.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.435
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- It's OK.

07:08.198 --> 07:09.950
It's an impossible situation.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.870
If I didn't want to be with you
so much, I would go home.

07:12.957 --> 07:14.947
But I can't have it both ways.

07:15.036 --> 07:17.913
I guess I just...

07:19.515 --> 07:21.630
Wait a minute.

07:22.754 --> 07:24.584
Hey. Maybe you can.

07:24.673 --> 07:27.425
- I can what?
- Have it both ways.

07:27.512 --> 07:29.661
- How?
- I can bring home here.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.309
- You can?
- You can?

07:31.391 --> 07:33.506
I'm gonna bring
your parents up here.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.420
- My parents?
- Her parents?

07:35.509 --> 07:37.659
Elves!

07:37.749 --> 07:39.340
Sir, the SOS.

07:39.428 --> 07:42.544
- Excuse me?
- SOS. Secret of Santa.

07:42.627 --> 07:44.617
There could be dire consequences.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.856
The possibilities increase
exponentially that the secret

07:47.945 --> 07:50.663
of the North Pole's location
could be compromised.

07:50.744 --> 07:54.099
Christmas would cease to exist,
crushing the hopes and dreams

07:54.183 --> 07:58.255
of the world's children and
extinguishing the joy of Santa's magic!

08:00.021 --> 08:02.171
There's that.

08:02.261 --> 08:04.774
He has a point.
My parents can't keep a secret.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.135
Listen, honey, the reason
you came up here was because of me.

08:08.219 --> 08:10.448
I'll do what it takes
to make this right.

08:10.538 --> 08:12.050
- You will?
- Yeah.

08:12.137 --> 08:14.605
Yes. Yeah, I will.

08:14.696 --> 08:17.335
You know why?
Cause what do they say about Santa?

08:17.416 --> 08:20.407
- He delivers!
- Yes!

08:20.495 --> 08:24.327
How will you pull it off? My parents
think you're a toymaker in Canada.

08:24.413 --> 08:26.005
How am I gonna pull this off?

08:34.010 --> 08:36.842
The answer is in the question.

08:36.929 --> 08:41.524
"How are we going to do this? My dad
thinks you're a toymaker in Canada."

08:41.607 --> 08:43.643
- Canada?
- Canada.

08:43.727 --> 08:46.160
It's north, in North America, eh?

08:46.246 --> 08:47.918
Vinegar on their French fries,

08:48.006 --> 08:50.644
they sit on their chesterfield
to watch hockey.

08:50.725 --> 08:53.363
Shoot the puck, daddy-o!
Come on, everybody!

08:53.444 --> 08:55.320
Elves, everybody listen up.

08:55.403 --> 09:29.992
Grab your hammers,
the in-laws are coming.

09:29.992 --> 09:32.425
Hey, Robbie.
Virgil, let me see your teeth.

09:32.511 --> 09:34.740
That's good. Hiya, elves.

09:34.830 --> 09:37.138
- Hi, Tooth Fairy.
- Open up. Let me see.

09:38.069 --> 09:39.058
Beautiful teeth.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.094
Open the doors if
you want to fall in love!

09:47.186 --> 09:49.335
Everybody, look,
Cupid in the house.

09:49.425 --> 09:51.939
Oh, work, work, work.
That's nice to see.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.821
- Hi, Cupid.
- What'd I miss?

09:53.904 --> 09:55.098
Where's fat boy?

09:55.184 --> 09:57.094
Merry Christmas, everybody.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.900
Cupid, what's up?
Hey, EB.

09:58.982 --> 10:01.212
- Santa.
- Molarnator.

10:01.302 --> 10:03.769
Sandman.

10:03.861 --> 10:05.498
Mother Nature, Father Time.

10:05.580 --> 10:08.457
Merry Christmas, again.
Good to see everyone.

10:08.539 --> 10:11.496
You think it's necessary
to call an emergency meeting?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.216
I'm ready to ride the sleigh,
know what I mean?

10:14.297 --> 10:16.527
We thought you should see this.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.652
Silver bells!

10:18.736 --> 10:22.444
I found 270 of them at shopping malls
scattered across the Northwest.

10:22.535 --> 10:26.321
I hereby call this session of the
Council of Legendary Figures to order.

10:26.413 --> 10:27.482
This is ridiculous.

10:27.573 --> 10:29.927
- Sandman!
- I'm up, I'm up!

10:30.012 --> 10:32.081
Hey, Cupid, nice skirt.

10:33.731 --> 10:36.369
Easter Bunny.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.009
Our first and only
order of business

10:39.089 --> 10:43.047
is the disciplinary action to be taken
against council member Jack Frost.

10:43.128 --> 10:45.880
Now that's what I'm talking about.

10:48.406 --> 10:50.361
You love it. Am I right?

10:50.445 --> 10:53.800
You guys finally woke up
and are giving me my own holiday.

10:54.884 --> 10:57.397
Frostmas, of course,
is just a placeholder.

10:57.483 --> 11:00.792
I'm wide open.
Frostgiving, the Frost of July.

11:00.882 --> 11:03.679
Frosthog Day,
the possibilities are endless.

11:03.761 --> 11:06.149
Jack, you are hereby
charged with 273 counts

11:06.240 --> 11:08.878
of attempted upstaging of Santa Claus.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.473
You froze a volcano in Hawaii,
you made it snow in the Amazon

11:12.558 --> 11:16.311
and you frosted Mexico, sending all
of the geese north for the winter.

11:16.397 --> 11:19.114
You violated
the Legendary Figures code of conduct

11:19.195 --> 11:21.344
in a manner that is
wilful and malicious.

11:21.434 --> 11:25.187
Excuse me. Did you just accuse me
of being skilful and delicious?

11:25.273 --> 11:26.864
- Please.
- Guilty as charged.

11:26.952 --> 11:30.227
You herald the season.
You're not a holiday.

11:30.311 --> 11:32.666
You're the best friend,
not the leading man.

11:32.751 --> 11:34.388
And you kill fruit.

11:34.470 --> 11:38.747
All in favour of suspending Jack Frost
from the Legendary Council, say...

11:38.829 --> 11:41.058
Wait a minute!
Father Time, wait a minute.

11:41.148 --> 11:44.822
You gotta understand,
I have enormous untapped potential.

11:44.907 --> 11:48.103
But all I am year after year
is an opening act.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.823
A setup man for Mr Big.

11:49.905 --> 11:51.701
- Why don't you let that go?
- No.

11:51.784 --> 11:54.218
We have the same conversation
every year.

11:54.303 --> 11:56.453
You get the soda cans
and the TV specials.

11:56.543 --> 11:58.498
The postage stamps,
the billboards,

11:58.582 --> 12:02.051
the beautiful adoring wife,
and the army of toy-building yes men.

12:02.141 --> 12:05.132
What do I get?
A few runny noses and some dead citrus.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.892
You know, Jack,
it's no picnic being me.

12:07.979 --> 12:12.494
Because of problems an entire continent
might go without toys. That's right.

12:12.577 --> 12:17.047
On top of that, I've got to protect the
secret of Santa because the in-laws...

12:17.136 --> 12:20.605
Mr and Mrs In-Bad-Mood-Every-Time-
l-Turn-Around are coming.

12:20.695 --> 12:23.333
Not supposed to,
gotta come up with a solution.

12:23.414 --> 12:26.405
On top of that, I'm worried
about being a father again

12:26.493 --> 12:29.564
because I wasn't all that good at it
the first time.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.801
Oh, Santa.

12:31.891 --> 12:33.085
We had no idea.

12:33.171 --> 12:35.320
Oh, Santa, I'm sorry.

12:35.410 --> 12:39.197
If it were me in the red suit, I'd
probably go right to the Escape Clause.

12:39.289 --> 12:42.280
Oh, no, the Escape Clause.
Way too extreme. Really.

12:42.368 --> 12:44.756
Escape Clause?
What's up with that?

12:44.847 --> 12:48.236
Maybe if you'd attend a meeting
once in a while you'd know.

12:48.326 --> 12:51.954
You can manipulate time
but can't grow hair.

12:52.045 --> 12:54.194
Legendary?
I don't think so.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.758
I am not evoking the Escape Clause.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.912
I made a commitment.
I'll handle the toys

13:00.002 --> 13:02.390
and be there when
my wife delivers that baby.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.630
- Let me help.
- You've done quite enough.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.756
No, no, no.
Instead of a suspension,

13:06.840 --> 13:08.989
- how about community service?
- Please.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.909
What if... what if I...

13:10.998 --> 13:13.875
What if I tutor myself
at the elbow of the master?

13:13.957 --> 13:17.631
Huh? I could lend a hand.
Make some toys, wrap a few presents.

13:17.716 --> 13:22.231
And if I don't make it with the hefty
man, he says the word you suspend me.

13:23.354 --> 13:25.424
Please, Santa.

13:25.514 --> 13:29.141
I know I don't deserve another chance,
but I am asking you for one.

13:31.392 --> 13:33.586
I want to make things right.

13:40.389 --> 13:41.377
All right.

13:41.468 --> 13:45.176
You don't want to get suspended?
I'll give you one more chance.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.734
But you have to be a
Jack-Frost-of-all-trades.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.101
- You have to listen to the elves.
- Uh-huh.

13:50.185 --> 13:52.335
Curtis is your boss.
And I mean it.

13:52.425 --> 13:55.063
If there's one,
one icicle out of place,

13:55.144 --> 13:58.658
- you are gone.
- I will not let you down.

14:01.382 --> 14:12.418
Motion carried.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.374
Ho ho ho!

14:14.458 --> 14:17.210
Boys, boys, save it
for the stables, will you?

14:18.976 --> 14:20.648
Look there. They got a new roof.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.770
Easy, easy!

14:22.735 --> 14:24.406
Uncle Scott is here!

14:25.734 --> 14:27.928
Lucy! Coat!

14:30.972 --> 14:32.246
Comet!

14:32.332 --> 14:35.403
Next time we fly, go easy
on the alfalfa, will you?

14:37.530 --> 14:40.043
- Uncle Scott.
- Hey, Luce. There we are.

14:40.969 --> 14:42.560
- There it is.
- All warm?

14:42.648 --> 14:45.878
Just like magic.
You have the warmest hug in the world.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.878
- Hello.
- Hi, Comet!

14:48.966 --> 14:50.922
- Hey, son.
- Hi, Dad.

14:51.006 --> 14:53.314
I missed you so much. Hi.

14:54.085 --> 14:57.359
A few days early, aren't you?
Isn't that baby due any moment?

14:57.443 --> 15:00.321
Oh, we got lots
to talk about. Hey, Neil.

15:00.402 --> 15:03.314
That's a...
That's a good-looking sweater vest.

15:03.401 --> 15:05.437
- It's reversible.
- Of course it is.

15:05.521 --> 15:07.829
- Let's go inside.
- Lucy, come on.

15:13.718 --> 15:15.708
Look at that,
it's snowing in Hawaii.

15:15.797 --> 15:18.708
Yeah. It's not really magical
like the one Charlie has,

15:18.796 --> 15:22.231
but I love it.
And now I have 12. See?

15:23.755 --> 15:27.542
You know, I have
quite the snow globe collection myself.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.104
- How's Danielle doing?
- Good.

15:31.192 --> 15:33.786
Thanks for letting me
go snowboarding with her.

15:33.872 --> 15:37.340
You're welcome.
Hey, I brought you something.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.420
Just a little thing.
Oh, boy.

15:40.508 --> 15:42.180
What a mess in here.

15:51.185 --> 15:53.982
There we are.

15:54.064 --> 15:56.861
Wedged behind a wheelbarrow.

15:56.943 --> 15:58.660
Dad! That's awesome!

15:58.742 --> 16:01.210
- Thank goodness it wasn't a car.
- Thanks, Dad.

16:01.302 --> 16:03.019
Wow, this is beautiful.

16:03.101 --> 16:05.170
Lucy, sweetheart,
what are you doing?

16:05.260 --> 16:06.932
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:07.020 --> 16:09.135
Come on out. Come out here. Come here.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.732
- Get out of the bag.
- Why can't I fit inside?

16:11.818 --> 16:13.217
It takes a lot of practice.

16:13.298 --> 16:15.811
I wish I could come
to the North Pole with you.

16:15.897 --> 16:18.091
I could help Carol a lot
and she loves me.

16:18.176 --> 16:20.769
That's true. And hey,

16:20.855 --> 16:24.403
maybe I should be the one
there for Carol.

16:24.494 --> 16:26.449
You know?
I mean, another mom.

16:26.533 --> 16:28.444
I could... I could help.

16:28.533 --> 16:31.251
- Hey, maybe...
- Girls.

16:31.332 --> 16:34.482
I've got a full sleigh.
You understand my situation.

16:34.571 --> 16:36.720
Now, wait a minute, Scott.

16:36.810 --> 16:38.640
Let's pause a moment here...

16:38.729 --> 16:41.242
...and take a feelings inventory.

16:45.967 --> 16:50.322
Let's look at what you're doing as
an uncle from a therapeutic standpoint.

16:50.405 --> 16:51.884
Charlie's been to the Pole.

16:51.965 --> 16:54.114
Your new baby's
being born at the Pole.

16:54.204 --> 16:56.876
Lucy's a member of
this family too, Scott.

16:56.963 --> 17:01.035
And if you harshly exclude her
from this formative experience,

17:01.122 --> 17:03.157
you could scar her for life.

17:03.241 --> 17:05.391
And, consequently, her parents,

17:05.480 --> 17:08.596
who must accompany her
on long-distance journeys.

17:10.519 --> 17:12.667
Please, Uncle Scott.

17:14.278 --> 17:16.507
Can I come to the North Pole, too?

17:21.635 --> 17:23.864
Please?

18:01.422 --> 18:04.458
Oh, that's awfully good, isn't it?

18:05.861 --> 18:08.090
Guys, I've done it.

18:14.018 --> 18:16.815
What have you done?

18:16.897 --> 18:20.935
Is it going to clean itself up?
I don't think so. Quickly, quickly.

18:23.175 --> 18:26.723
Curtis, I haven't seen
the bearded wonder around for a while.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.168
- Where'd he go?
- None of your skis' wax.

18:29.253 --> 18:33.723
No need to be nippy. With all
the stress, I wouldn't blame the guy

18:33.812 --> 18:36.644
- for doing that escape hatch thing.
- Escape Clause.

18:36.731 --> 18:38.925
<i>Little elf woman, one cocoa, por favor.</i>

18:39.010 --> 18:40.840
- Right away.
- Thank you.

18:40.929 --> 18:43.237
How does that Escape Clause work,
anyway?

18:43.328 --> 18:45.922
Sorry, classified.
Elfland Security Act.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.316
- That's just what I'd say.
- What?

18:48.407 --> 18:50.966
If I didn't know anything.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.394
Don't be embarrassed.
Makes perfect sense,

18:54.485 --> 18:56.395
big guy would know important stuff.

18:56.484 --> 18:58.917
For your information,
I'm elf number one.

18:59.003 --> 19:01.562
I know all there is
about the Hall of Snow Globes.

19:01.642 --> 19:05.793
Everybody knows about the Hall
of Snow Globes. That's not special.

19:06.561 --> 19:07.879
Not special?

19:09.600 --> 19:12.272
Not special?
It's the most top-secret,

19:12.359 --> 19:14.747
hush-hush, amazing
place in the world.

19:14.838 --> 19:18.750
It's where every Santa through history
has kept his personal snow globe.

19:18.837 --> 19:21.634
How can you say that
that's not special?

19:21.716 --> 19:22.864
Because it isn't.

19:22.955 --> 19:26.833
Unless you know what it has to do with
the Escape Clause, which you don't.

19:27.794 --> 19:30.182
I bet Santa doesn't even trust you.

19:31.673 --> 19:34.550
Now, you listen here, frostface.

19:35.631 --> 19:38.508
Secret Santa snow globe.
Santa.

19:41.749 --> 19:44.740
I wish that I had never
become Santa at all.

19:48.907 --> 19:50.658
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

19:50.746 --> 19:53.213
This is where I'm transported
through time

19:53.305 --> 19:55.660
and everything goes back
to the way it was,

19:55.745 --> 19:58.497
like I'd never become Santa at all.

20:01.382 --> 20:03.212
Gets the snow globe,

20:03.301 --> 20:05.894
puts his hands on it, says the words,

20:05.980 --> 20:07.777
and then whoosh!

20:07.860 --> 20:09.577
Job opening: Santa Claus.

20:09.659 --> 20:11.172
Told you I know everything.

20:12.138 --> 20:13.332
Wow.

20:13.418 --> 20:17.569
I never dreamed I'd be so well-connected
to elves in high places.

20:17.656 --> 20:20.692
We really must party
in my condo in Gstaad sometime.

20:20.775 --> 20:22.094
It'd be fun.

20:22.175 --> 20:26.133
Tell me, how do you get into
the Hall of Snow Globes, anyway?

20:26.214 --> 20:28.852
Sorry, Jack. Now that's classified.

20:28.933 --> 20:30.365
I know that...

20:30.452 --> 20:32.363
...elf number one.

20:45.567 --> 20:48.239
- Did you bring the deep-dreamin' stuff?
- Got it.

20:48.326 --> 20:52.716
It's important they sleep and dream
they're on a wonderful flight to Canada.

20:52.805 --> 20:54.681
- I'm with the programme.
- Good.

20:54.764 --> 20:56.675
I may be sleepy, but I'm not stupid.

20:57.563 --> 20:59.315
Yeah, well, take the hat off.

20:59.403 --> 21:01.518
I get sniffly without my cap.

21:01.602 --> 21:03.557
OK, OK.

21:03.641 --> 21:04.994
All right, all right.

21:05.081 --> 21:07.389
Hey, Dad?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.357
Scott Calvin, as I live and breathe.

21:10.439 --> 21:12.270
Good thing you called.

21:12.359 --> 21:15.555
Otherwise I don't know
if I would've remembered you.

21:15.637 --> 21:17.548
It's me, good old Scott Calvin.

21:17.637 --> 21:19.672
You look a little like Father Time.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.110
Doesn't look anything
like Father Time.

21:26.474 --> 21:29.112
Oh. That's a nice door.

21:29.193 --> 21:31.626
Well, thank you. Yeah.
It was a little sticky,

21:31.712 --> 21:33.225
but smooth as a baby's butt now.

21:33.312 --> 21:35.779
- Come, take a feel.
- Oh, why not, huh?

21:35.871 --> 21:37.269
Look at that.

21:37.350 --> 21:39.625
Very butt-like.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.937
Who's your pal?

21:41.029 --> 21:44.498
Sandy. This is my associate.
He'll be taking us to the airport.

21:44.588 --> 21:48.057
- An associate? Business must be good.
- Busy as usual.

21:48.147 --> 21:51.821
So busy you can't bring our daughter
to visit her mother and father?

21:51.906 --> 21:53.418
Scott.

21:53.505 --> 21:56.416
Oh, so nice to see you.

21:56.504 --> 21:58.539
- You too, Sylvia.
- And your friend?

21:58.623 --> 22:00.773
- Sandy.
- Sandy.

22:00.863 --> 22:02.580
Nice to meet you.

22:02.662 --> 22:06.176
Do you know how excited
we were to get your phone call?

22:06.261 --> 22:09.650
See, we get so few,
and each one is special.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.013
Oh, come on, you guys,

22:11.099 --> 22:12.930
you'll catch pneumonia out here.

22:13.978 --> 22:16.446
It's so wonderful
to have you all here.

22:16.538 --> 22:17.936
- Festive.
- Easy.

22:18.017 --> 22:19.609
Please, please sit down.

22:19.696 --> 22:22.494
Oh, no, no, no. No.
We gotta get to the airport.

22:22.576 --> 22:25.692
Kind of a hurry. Let's get
your bags and pop 'em in the car.

22:25.774 --> 22:27.446
- I'm almost packed.
- Great!

22:27.534 --> 22:32.560
Throw my underwear in a bag. It's not
like we're going to the North Pole.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.370
- It's cold in Canada.
- Well...

22:34.452 --> 22:36.282
Remember when we went to Yosemite?

22:36.371 --> 22:38.042
Oh, here we go, Yosemite again.

22:38.130 --> 22:40.564
It was freezing
and there were bears.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.321
You never left the lodge.

22:42.409 --> 22:44.603
Because it was freezing.

22:44.688 --> 22:47.440
- And there were bears?
- Yes! And it was freezing.

22:47.527 --> 22:50.836
- It was freezing weather?
- It was in the freezing weather.

22:50.926 --> 22:54.122
Let me understand.
You did not enjoy the trip to Yosemite?

22:54.205 --> 22:55.957
- You heard me.
- I heard you.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.028
What?

23:12.119 --> 23:14.155
What part of our plan was not clear?

23:14.239 --> 23:17.071
Let's put them to sleep
when they get into the car.

23:17.158 --> 23:20.149
I couldn't stand to hear
the Yosemite story anymore.

23:20.237 --> 23:23.387
OK. So let's figure how we'll
get in the car. We'll both...

23:23.476 --> 23:25.147
Sandman, what are you doing?

23:28.194 --> 23:30.707
What? Sandman. Sandman!

23:32.833 --> 23:36.187
Great, I get to throw
his underwear in a bag.

24:00.184 --> 24:03.016
Hey, Mrs C. What you doing?

24:03.103 --> 24:04.933
Oh, hi, Jack.

24:05.022 --> 24:07.740
I'm trying to pick a tree
the whole family will love.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.209
Ah, family.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.609
You know, I cannot imagine
how hard it must be

24:13.699 --> 24:16.258
keeping such a big secret
from your folks.

24:16.338 --> 24:18.771
Oh, you have no idea.

24:21.017 --> 24:22.846
Tell me, Mrs Claus...

24:22.935 --> 24:25.004
...being legendary by marriage,

24:25.094 --> 24:28.483
do you ever find yourself wondering
if it's all really worth it?

24:30.413 --> 24:32.607
Well, it's definitely worth it.

24:34.691 --> 24:38.399
I'm sure dropping your life,
schlepping all the way to the North Pole

24:38.490 --> 24:40.639
- has been totally worthwhile.
- Yeah.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.845
Probably not one iota,
not even a scintilla, of regret?

24:43.928 --> 24:45.520
- Not one.
- Yeah.

24:45.608 --> 24:49.645
Look at that. Oh, dear.
A little sad, neglected maybe.

24:49.726 --> 24:51.762
Just needs a little tender loving care

24:51.846 --> 24:55.155
that nobody's bothering to give,
don't you think?

24:58.363 --> 25:00.115
It's perfect.

25:00.203 --> 25:03.035
I will give you all
the TLC that you need.

25:03.122 --> 25:05.077
Scott loves decorating the tree.

25:05.161 --> 25:08.675
He always insists on putting
the tree topper on himself.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.154
Ho ho ho!

25:13.439 --> 25:15.030
They're here!

25:16.118 --> 25:18.108
This is so exciting.

25:41.589 --> 25:44.307
I'm here! I cannot believe it!
I'm actually here!

25:44.388 --> 25:47.777
What a wonderful surprise.
I didn't know you were coming.

25:47.867 --> 25:50.175
- Uncle Scott brought me.
- Hey.

25:50.266 --> 25:51.938
And we tagged along!

25:52.026 --> 25:54.493
Hey! Hey! Hi!

25:54.585 --> 25:57.303
Oh, it's tall people...
Not that you're not tall.

25:57.384 --> 25:58.612
Surprise!

25:58.704 --> 26:01.342
- Hello!
- Oh, you look wonderful.

26:01.423 --> 26:03.617
- Really?
- You are glowing.

26:03.702 --> 26:07.091
- What did you think of my parents?
- They slept the entire trip.

26:07.181 --> 26:09.774
This is amazing!
Can we see the workshop?

26:09.860 --> 26:11.452
Yes. Go right there.
Go ahead.

26:11.539 --> 26:12.858
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

26:12.939 --> 26:16.897
My mom and dad can't know we're
at Santa's workshop in the North Pole.

26:16.978 --> 26:18.376
Where do they think we are?

26:18.457 --> 26:19.856
Welcome to Canada!

26:21.336 --> 26:22.815
Eh?

26:24.175 --> 26:26.564
An easy flight,
we cruised through customs.

26:26.655 --> 26:29.373
Oh, what a strange flight.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.569
Go, go, go.

26:31.653 --> 26:33.643
It was like a dream.

26:35.452 --> 26:37.726
And such a nice meal.

26:37.811 --> 26:39.243
They gave you a meal?

26:39.330 --> 26:41.366
I got four nuts in a pouch.

26:41.450 --> 26:43.565
And you had us sit in coach.

26:43.649 --> 26:46.208
No, that was first class.

26:46.288 --> 26:49.006
And I got a chance to sit
next to Tony Bennett.

26:49.087 --> 26:50.440
Mom! Dad!

26:50.527 --> 26:53.199
Sweetheart! Sweetheart.

26:53.286 --> 26:55.116
- Come here.
- Oh, you!

26:55.205 --> 26:56.558
Look at you, look at you.

26:56.645 --> 26:58.600
And look at this, look at this.

26:58.684 --> 26:59.878
It could be twins.

26:59.964 --> 27:03.796
But since you married the toymaker,
we don't get a lot of information.

27:03.882 --> 27:05.918
Oh, honey, just stop it, OK?

27:06.002 --> 27:09.834
Sweetheart, I am just so happy
to see you, darling.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.388
I'm so happy to see you, too, Mom.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.629
I'm sure you have
a perfectly good reason

27:14.719 --> 27:16.754
for shutting us out of your life.

27:29.474 --> 27:31.987
Magnificent.

27:32.073 --> 27:33.745
It's amazing.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.550
Killer.

27:41.070 --> 27:43.503
Please remember,
you're welcome to observe,

27:43.589 --> 27:46.182
but don't touch
or interfere with toy-making.

27:46.268 --> 27:48.702
I'll make sure she
doesn't get into anything.

27:48.788 --> 27:51.176
Look! Kobi the Magic Panda
and accessories!

27:51.267 --> 27:52.540
Lucy!

27:52.626 --> 27:54.662
Lucy, come back here.
Whoa!

27:54.746 --> 27:56.303
Trains.

27:56.385 --> 27:59.023
I'm... I'm just gonna go make a doll!

28:04.702 --> 28:06.738
Oh, excellent job.

28:06.822 --> 28:09.016
Bang, bang!

28:16.698 --> 28:17.926
Isn't that fun?

28:18.018 --> 28:19.689
Faster, worker elves, faster.

28:25.935 --> 28:28.812
The Hall of Snow Globes, perhaps?

28:41.290 --> 28:44.086
What might we have here.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.207
It's a lot of beans.

28:49.207 --> 28:51.162
How many beans can he eat?

28:52.206 --> 28:53.923
Who are you?

28:54.005 --> 28:55.438
Who are you?

28:55.525 --> 28:58.118
You don't resemble
one of the red man's minions.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.195
- What's the deal?
- I'm Lucy. Scott's my uncle.

29:01.283 --> 29:04.080
Ohh. I'm Frost.

29:04.162 --> 29:06.311
- Jack Frost.
- Who?

29:06.401 --> 29:10.632
Jack Frost.
You know, the Jack Frost?

29:10.720 --> 29:13.108
Never heard of you.

29:15.078 --> 29:17.114
Jack Frost.

29:17.198 --> 29:19.267
Legendary figure. Ring a bell?

29:19.357 --> 29:21.711
No. But I know about Tooth Fairy

29:21.796 --> 29:23.627
and Sandman and the Easter Bunny.

29:23.715 --> 29:27.832
You got to know about me, I'm
a legendary figure, with enormous power.

29:27.914 --> 29:31.349
- OK, OK, chill.
- I invented chill!

29:32.952 --> 29:34.431
Sorry.

29:34.512 --> 29:36.024
Hey...

29:36.111 --> 29:38.306
How would you like to be
one of my elves?

29:38.391 --> 29:39.982
No.

29:41.150 --> 29:42.548
Hey, Mom?

29:43.669 --> 29:45.386
No.

29:45.468 --> 29:47.777
What a quaint little village.

29:47.868 --> 29:50.427
Everybody's just so petite.

29:50.507 --> 29:53.816
No. Tom Cruise is petite.
These people are short.

29:53.906 --> 29:57.419
- What's the deal with them?
- Who? What?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.574
Oh...

30:00.623 --> 30:02.181
Have you ever been to Canada?

30:02.263 --> 30:03.900
No. It's too far.

30:03.982 --> 30:07.098
We did go to Rochester, New York, once,
to visit her sister.

30:07.181 --> 30:10.536
Very lovely place.
But it's not Canada, is it?

30:10.620 --> 30:11.655
No.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.934
Well, this is...

30:14.979 --> 30:16.969
This is what Canadians look like.

30:25.295 --> 30:27.967
And stretch.

30:28.054 --> 30:30.329
Stretch.

30:30.414 --> 30:33.007
Let all those packages go.

30:33.093 --> 30:36.323
Know that you're enough.

30:36.412 --> 30:38.288
And breathe.

30:44.569 --> 30:46.559
Very good.

30:46.648 --> 30:50.526
Don't forget you can do this on your own
whenever you get stressed out.

30:50.607 --> 30:52.403
I won't always be here
to help you.

30:52.486 --> 30:56.319
Stress can reduce your life
by hundreds of years.

30:56.405 --> 30:58.043
Hundreds.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.319
You take Christmas very seriously.

31:00.404 --> 31:02.792
- It's the most wonderful time of year.
- Yeah!

31:02.883 --> 31:05.442
Honey, just because
you're not into Christmas

31:05.522 --> 31:07.830
doesn't mean others can't enjoy it.

31:07.921 --> 31:12.436
Kids won't enjoy their toys this year.
This should've been in stores weeks ago.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.955
Oh. No worries. We have a unique
distribution system here.

31:16.039 --> 31:19.825
In order to distribute this stuff
you're gonna have to freeze time.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.066
Manipulating the space-time continuum

31:23.156 --> 31:25.874
for one-night global delivery
is the easy part.

31:25.955 --> 31:28.025
Who are you?

31:28.874 --> 31:30.148
Curtis.

31:31.354 --> 31:32.388
Eh?

31:34.513 --> 31:35.552
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

31:35.552 --> 31:38.349
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

31:38.431 --> 31:40.308
Come here. Got some exciting news.

31:40.391 --> 31:43.223
Will put a little spring
into your elfin step.

31:43.310 --> 31:46.346
Santa says he really
wants you to take a break.

31:46.429 --> 31:48.817
So there's a delicious vat

31:48.908 --> 31:51.785
of steaming hot cocoa in the lounge

31:51.867 --> 31:54.505
with your little names on it.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.980
Oh, it's a tantalising blend

31:59.065 --> 32:01.214
of full, rich cocoa

32:01.304 --> 32:03.692
with just a suggestion...

32:03.783 --> 32:05.932
...of vanilla.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.657
Get in there and try some, won't you?

32:09.741 --> 32:11.254
It's got your names on it.

32:11.341 --> 32:13.570
Enjoy.

32:35.493 --> 32:38.370
A sumptuous blend of Gold Coast
and Spanish cocoas.

32:38.452 --> 32:41.443
Sweet to the palate,
but, oh, so warm to the tummy.

32:41.531 --> 32:43.998
With a trickle of cinnamon
and orange essence,

32:44.090 --> 32:47.240
enough to drive
the taste buds mad!

32:49.128 --> 32:51.039
Go on.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.188
Look at this kitchen! Oh!

33:12.280 --> 33:14.509
Look at the size of that oven.

33:14.599 --> 33:17.396
You could cook
a woolly mammoth in there.

33:17.478 --> 33:20.389
- Let's have something to eat.
- You got some operation.

33:20.477 --> 33:22.751
You've been holding out.
Why the secrecy?

33:22.836 --> 33:25.429
There's no secrets. We're family.

33:25.515 --> 33:29.427
Heavens sakes, you must be the in-laws.
So very pleased to meet you.

33:30.394 --> 33:31.712
Hi.

33:31.793 --> 33:34.067
- Bud, Sylvia, this is...
- Jack Frost.

33:34.152 --> 33:38.303
Not Jack Frost. He's playing Jack Frost
in our "Yippee, it's Canada!" parade.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.619
Oh, yes, of course.

33:39.711 --> 33:42.224
To bring frosty cheer
to the workers.

33:42.310 --> 33:45.346
I'm kind of like the team mascot, eh?

33:46.788 --> 33:48.267
Who does your hair?

33:48.348 --> 33:51.180
You like it? It's... I freeze-dry it.

33:52.146 --> 33:53.864
Sir, can I borrow you?

33:55.026 --> 33:56.697
Yeah. Excuse me just a minute.

34:02.023 --> 34:03.979
We have a small paperwork problem.

34:04.063 --> 34:07.213
Go ahead. I'll make sure
everyone's as happy as a lark.

34:07.302 --> 34:09.610
For that's why I'm here, eh?

34:09.701 --> 34:12.772
Cocoacchinos, anyone?

34:12.860 --> 34:16.931
- What's going on? What's going on?
- We're still trying to assess here.

34:18.538 --> 34:20.333
Somebody get me out of here.

34:20.417 --> 34:24.295
We've got a cache failure in the
motherboard. You gotta get a rerouter.

34:24.376 --> 34:26.411
- You need a solder gun...
- I can't see!

34:26.495 --> 34:28.725
You need some scissors here.

34:29.694 --> 34:31.809
I'm off to help electrics.

34:49.408 --> 34:51.920
Kitchen this size,
I can't find a sandwich.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.803
Oh, let me help you there.

34:53.886 --> 34:56.603
For heaven... How does
something like that happen?

34:56.685 --> 34:58.596
Oh, dear.

35:05.522 --> 35:10.072
- Cocoacchinos, anyone?
- Oh. Yes.

35:10.161 --> 35:11.832
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.672
Let me get you
this chair here.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.637
There we go.
Isn't that lovely?

35:16.719 --> 35:19.073
And here you go.
I hope you like it.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.432
- Oh, my.
- It's my own recipe.

35:21.517 --> 35:23.553
Yes.

35:25.076 --> 35:26.906
Minty.

35:26.995 --> 35:28.826
Doesn't it make you feel fresh?

35:28.915 --> 35:31.986
Oh, yes, it does.

35:32.074 --> 35:35.383
Oh, my, I just... I love your hair.

35:35.473 --> 35:36.985
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

35:37.072 --> 35:39.869
- I love yours.
- Really?

35:39.951 --> 35:43.499
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Oh, you're so adorable.

35:43.590 --> 35:46.581
You divine little kitten, you.

35:47.789 --> 35:50.586
- And I bet you sing, too.
- No, no, no, no. No.

35:50.668 --> 35:52.180
Go on. I bet you can sing.

35:52.267 --> 35:54.939
- Maybe a little bit.
- I knew it, I knew it.

35:55.026 --> 35:57.903
- Sing something.
- What would you like to hear?

35:57.985 --> 35:59.304
How about...

36:08.222 --> 36:09.813
Oh, I love it.

36:13.220 --> 36:15.972
No, no, go back to
the other line, the part before...

36:20.538 --> 36:22.687
Oh, it gives me chills.

36:27.616 --> 36:28.843
Oh, what a lyric.

36:28.935 --> 36:31.892
- What's going on over here?
- Your mother is fabulous!

36:33.973 --> 36:35.725
Would you like to be my elf?

36:37.092 --> 36:38.127
You heard me.

36:39.212 --> 36:41.679
Heads up! Heads up!
Coming through!

36:41.771 --> 36:44.967
- Fire!
- Back off! Back off!

36:45.050 --> 36:47.040
Back off!

36:47.129 --> 36:50.006
We got a dangerous situation.
Back off!

36:50.088 --> 36:54.239
Back off! Don't breathe.
Don't breathe in.

36:57.766 --> 37:01.359
What's wrong with you people?
We were an inch away from Armageddon.

37:01.444 --> 37:04.083
- I'll get a mop.
- Oh, Dad, you did great.

37:04.164 --> 37:05.881
- You all right?
- Had to be done.

37:05.963 --> 37:08.476
- That was wonderful, honey.
- Hi, everyone.

37:08.562 --> 37:11.029
- Oh, my!
- You're awake!

37:11.121 --> 37:13.793
Awake, yeah. Who are you?

37:13.880 --> 37:17.633
Oh. Mom and Dad, this is Scott's
ex-wife Laura and her husband Neil.

37:17.719 --> 37:19.277
- Hi.
- Their daughter, Lucy.

37:19.359 --> 37:21.314
Hi.

37:21.398 --> 37:24.628
They came to join us
for Christmas. Isn't that nice?

37:26.715 --> 37:28.944
If Scott is that close to his ex-wife,

37:29.034 --> 37:32.469
and you don't find that
incredibly threatening,

37:32.553 --> 37:34.783
I'm sure it's very nice.

37:35.792 --> 37:37.623
Hi, everybody, I'm back.

37:40.351 --> 37:41.669
Hey, what happened?

37:41.750 --> 37:45.662
You didn't tell your in-laws your
ex-wife is spending Christmas with you.

37:45.749 --> 37:47.545
More secrets.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.619
Nothing works in this joint.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.538
Think this is something?
See the delivery room.

37:58.625 --> 37:59.818
Is there a problem?

37:59.904 --> 38:01.860
I want to see the delivery room.

38:01.944 --> 38:03.217
What?

38:05.183 --> 38:08.412
- Heavy load! Coming through!
- Watch your backs, people.

38:08.501 --> 38:10.139
Set it down there.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.098
This is the delivery room?
This is not a delivery room.

38:13.180 --> 38:15.090
This is a disaster. What's going on?

38:15.179 --> 38:17.976
We're remodelling.
It'll be huge, comfortable.

38:18.058 --> 38:21.049
This is a broom closet.
The oven in the kitchen's bigger.

38:21.137 --> 38:24.048
This isn't a broom closet...
Watch your back again!

38:24.136 --> 38:27.730
There we go. This is the hospital
for the entire toy factory.

38:27.815 --> 38:28.964
How about that, Syl?

38:29.055 --> 38:32.887
Our grandchild is being born in a
broom closet of a Canadian toy factory.

38:32.973 --> 38:37.488
You can be honest with us. Don't be
afraid. Are you held against your will?

38:37.572 --> 38:40.643
- Is there even a doctor here?
- Yes, there's a doctor...

38:40.731 --> 38:43.847
Hello! I'm Dr Hismus.
Pleasure to meet you, eh?

38:43.930 --> 38:46.159
- This is the doctor?
- Very good doctor.

38:46.249 --> 38:48.921
- I see.
- Watch your backs. Excuse me.

38:49.008 --> 38:51.726
What are we supposed to do
with the wood in here?

38:51.807 --> 38:54.240
- Why do we have wood in here?
- I'm taking over.

38:54.326 --> 38:56.715
Don't be silly.
Let the tiny Canadians do it.

38:56.806 --> 38:58.761
Somebody get me an apron
and a hammer.

38:58.845 --> 39:00.800
Get him an apron and hammer.

39:01.284 --> 39:04.832
<i>- What's happening?
- Emergency in the toy factory.</i>

39:04.923 --> 39:08.676
- I'll be back in two minutes.
- OK, let's go to work.

39:10.601 --> 39:12.556
I got this one.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.517
There it is! I got it!

39:16.519 --> 39:18.713
Look out, coming through. I got it.

39:18.798 --> 39:21.392
Go. Boy, these bears...
We gotta make 'em stop.

39:21.478 --> 39:25.025
It's a great way to put out an eye.
Shut this place down!

39:25.116 --> 39:26.834
Hey, cut it off, cut it off.

39:26.916 --> 39:28.985
Right there's the start. Cut it off.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.711
Where are the fire elves?

39:35.193 --> 39:36.864
Help. Give me an aisle. Come on.

39:36.952 --> 39:40.068
- Let the professionals at it.
- Hit the base of the flame.

39:48.909 --> 39:50.500
Sir, sir!

39:51.508 --> 39:55.136
Curtis, stop. If you're gonna
tell me our entire facility is in ruin,

39:55.226 --> 39:58.024
Christmas is tomorrow,
for the first time in history

39:58.106 --> 40:02.017
kids of the world won't get what they
asked for because I failed, stop it.

40:02.104 --> 40:04.776
I can't stand one more
piece of bad news.

40:04.863 --> 40:06.615
- Then good news, sir.
- What?

40:06.703 --> 40:08.852
Your pants are on fire.

40:08.942 --> 40:10.659
Fire in the hole!

40:10.741 --> 40:12.697
- Captain.
- I'm on it, Curtis.

40:21.258 --> 40:24.055
Oh, my. Is there anything I can do?

40:24.137 --> 40:26.172
Put a chill on my bottom for me?

40:27.696 --> 40:30.607
Go to the naughty and nice area,
help the elves clean up.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.810
- Go! Move, move!
- Quickly, move it!

40:32.894 --> 40:35.123
- Stop lollygagging!
- Status report.

40:35.213 --> 40:37.044
Springs on the pogo sticks melted.

40:37.133 --> 40:41.329
Let me see, let me see. I like that toy.
Glenda. Give me a status report.

40:41.411 --> 40:44.288
- Legs on the ironing board burned up.
- Let me see.

40:46.050 --> 40:48.404
Only the wheels are left
on the wooden truck.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.206
That was my favourite.

40:51.328 --> 40:54.842
The rockets are in pieces,
but the launch motors are intact, sir.

40:54.927 --> 40:57.394
Launch motors intact?
Get over here.

40:57.486 --> 40:58.919
I think I got an idea.

41:23.198 --> 41:24.949
Jet-powered scooter board.

41:26.237 --> 41:27.669
Way to go, Santa!

41:29.516 --> 41:31.665
That's how the men in red
get things done.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.109
We got a schedule to keep,
get back to work.

41:34.194 --> 41:36.229
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

41:36.313 --> 41:39.861
Whoa. You're just amazing.

41:39.952 --> 41:42.909
Can't keep a good Santa down, huh?

41:44.391 --> 41:46.984
So, doesn't anything bother you?

41:47.070 --> 41:48.899
You don't sweat the small stuff.

41:48.988 --> 41:52.582
Problem at work, that's a challenge.
Problem at home, a problem.

41:54.346 --> 41:57.655
Uncle Scott, that was the most
amazing thing I've ever seen.

41:59.105 --> 42:01.664
Wait a minute.
You weren't worried, were you?

42:01.744 --> 42:04.098
- Not for a second.
- Neither was I.

42:04.183 --> 42:07.299
Uncle Scott, you know
what I've been dying to see?

42:07.382 --> 42:08.371
No.

42:08.462 --> 42:10.133
Your snow globe collection.

42:11.701 --> 42:14.009
You can see it,
if you can catch me.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.417
Watch out, coming through.

42:16.499 --> 42:18.535
Last one up is a glazed ham!

42:30.894 --> 42:33.772
Don't watch what I'm doing,
this is a very secret code.

42:33.853 --> 42:36.811
- Oh, come on, Uncle Scott.
- It is.

42:39.652 --> 42:40.925
Very secret.

42:45.890 --> 42:47.004
Watch what happens.

42:48.409 --> 42:50.444
Look out, look out!

43:19.638 --> 43:21.356
Whoa.

43:22.677 --> 43:24.508
Where are we?

43:24.597 --> 43:27.713
I told you I have an amazing collection
of snow globes.

43:27.796 --> 43:30.355
This is the Hall of Snow Globes.

43:32.354 --> 43:33.787
Go on in.

43:37.992 --> 43:41.620
This is so beautiful, Uncle Scott.

43:44.190 --> 43:48.148
These are all the snow globes for
all the Santas that have ever been.

43:48.229 --> 43:49.662
And this one...

43:49.749 --> 43:51.261
...that one's mine.

43:51.348 --> 43:54.066
It's my very favourite,
just like you gave Charlie.

43:54.147 --> 43:56.058
Yeah. You know,

43:56.147 --> 43:58.296
I'm kind of partial to this one myself.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.784
Look, it's snowin'.

44:02.784 --> 44:05.298
Yeah. You got a good collection.

44:05.383 --> 44:07.772
Too bad you don't have one like this.

44:09.142 --> 44:12.338
- It's... It's me.
- Yeah.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.656
Hugging a snowman.

44:19.779 --> 44:22.246
Oh! And he turns pink!

44:22.338 --> 44:25.454
I told you your warm hugs were magical.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.731
Thank you for my present, Santa.

44:27.816 --> 44:30.204
It's OK.

44:31.295 --> 44:32.932
Well, look at it this way.

44:33.014 --> 44:35.812
One down, 2.6 billion to go.

44:35.893 --> 44:38.407
We better get out of here.

44:38.493 --> 44:40.084
Hold on, here we go.

45:20.679 --> 45:23.192
Do you want me
to put on the tree topper?

45:23.278 --> 45:25.996
Save it for Scott.
He always puts the tree topper on.

45:26.077 --> 45:28.431
Of course.

45:30.276 --> 45:32.835
It's strange how much

45:32.915 --> 45:35.144
this resembles...

45:39.513 --> 45:42.310
- Hi, honey, I'm back.
- Oh, honey, are you OK?

45:42.392 --> 45:45.349
Great. Good news is
I get to spend time with you guys.

45:45.431 --> 45:47.227
Scott.

45:47.310 --> 45:48.743
Sir.

45:48.830 --> 45:50.262
Sorry to interrupt.

45:52.788 --> 45:55.097
There's something
you need to check twice.

45:57.787 --> 45:58.775
Two minutes?

46:02.745 --> 46:05.736
What? What?

46:06.904 --> 46:12.180
We have a problem. This is unreadable.
Because it's all crinkled up.

46:12.261 --> 46:15.093
You gotta plan it out.
It's gotta be in my office.

46:15.180 --> 46:17.215
Yeah, my office.

46:17.299 --> 46:19.176
- Neil?
- What?

46:19.259 --> 46:22.136
Let's go find Lucy,
get her washed up for dinner, OK?

46:22.218 --> 46:24.014
Leave that here.
Leave it.

46:24.977 --> 46:26.125
We'll be right back.

46:31.255 --> 46:32.653
Don't worry, honey.

46:33.774 --> 46:35.047
That's not gonna work.

46:35.133 --> 46:37.089
It's busy season.

46:37.173 --> 46:39.447
It's always his busy season.

46:49.609 --> 46:53.282
That's Uncle Scott's snow globe.
You're not supposed to have that.

46:53.367 --> 46:56.756
- I know. Isn't it great?
- It's not great at all.

46:56.846 --> 47:00.554
You've done a terrible thing.
You'll be on the naughty list for life.

47:00.645 --> 47:02.919
But naughty list people have more fun.

47:03.004 --> 47:06.439
- I'm going for help.
- I wouldn't do that.

47:07.843 --> 47:10.481
Mom, Dad! Over here, quick!

47:10.562 --> 47:11.835
- Lucy!
- What?

47:13.481 --> 47:15.391
- Come on, hurry!
- What's wrong?

47:17.480 --> 47:18.468
What's wrong?

47:19.439 --> 47:21.110
Sweetheart, what is it?

47:22.078 --> 47:24.386
I told you not to do that.

47:24.477 --> 47:28.435
Jack Frost took Uncle Scott's snow globe
and he knows that it's not his.

47:32.235 --> 47:33.303
Stop!

47:35.394 --> 47:36.542
Stop!

47:38.353 --> 47:41.344
Don't! What did you do?

47:41.432 --> 47:43.023
I froze them.

47:46.030 --> 47:49.339
Now, am I gonna have to do
the same thing to you?

47:49.429 --> 47:54.547
Or are you going to get in that closet
and stay there without saying a word?

48:02.825 --> 48:04.098
Smart girl.

48:06.703 --> 48:09.535
Oh, smile, will you?

48:09.622 --> 48:12.818
I've had kids beg me
to freeze their parents.

48:14.781 --> 48:18.409
And to think I asked you to be my elf.

48:20.019 --> 48:22.691
Of course all those bears
are machine-washable.

48:22.778 --> 48:26.008
Right. Just put it on the card.
I can't be in two places at once.

48:26.097 --> 48:29.805
You gotta manage and stop
calling every time something goes wrong.

48:29.896 --> 48:32.170
I'm a little busy
with my family, Curtis.

48:32.255 --> 48:35.371
All I want to see is
busy, busy worker tushies.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.284
Hey, hey,
I'm rolling downhill.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.329
This is not up to code,
this building.

48:39.413 --> 48:41.130
You're number one. Act like it.

48:41.212 --> 48:43.441
Why haven't you put
the tree topper on yet?

48:43.531 --> 48:45.408
Scott's just been a little busy.

48:48.010 --> 48:49.920
Tell your dad to do it.

48:50.009 --> 48:53.887
And then watch the suddenly displaced
Mr Claus run right over.

48:53.968 --> 48:55.480
Go ahead. It'll be fun.

48:55.567 --> 48:58.001
Dad, do you wanna help me
with the tree topper?

48:58.087 --> 48:59.565
Yeah, in a minute.

49:02.645 --> 49:04.475
I don't know who he is anymore.

49:04.564 --> 49:06.395
I don't know who he is, either.

49:06.484 --> 49:08.997
Neil, Lucy and Laura
should be here for this.

49:09.083 --> 49:10.993
They left a while ago.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.436
Some Canadians invited them
over for cocoa.

49:13.521 --> 49:16.319
You know how they are.
Yak-yak, yak-yak, eh?

49:17.280 --> 49:20.669
Scott? Tree topper, what do you say?

49:20.759 --> 49:23.591
Scott, honey,
let's put the tree topper on.

49:23.678 --> 49:27.067
- We can make a toast.
- You built this place on a fault line.

49:27.157 --> 49:30.785
Millions of kids in Australia go
without gifts. What can I do for you?

49:30.876 --> 49:33.992
- Tree topper.
- Oh, yeah, tree topper. Good.

49:34.075 --> 49:35.268
Scott? Toast.

49:36.794 --> 49:37.862
Just a second.

49:39.753 --> 49:41.265
Good.

49:41.352 --> 49:44.582
Bad. Well, good for goodness sakes.

49:44.671 --> 49:47.821
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Curtis, I can't talk right now,

49:47.910 --> 49:51.140
I'm putting the tree topper on.
It's important. Can't talk.

49:51.229 --> 49:53.139
Curtis, please, please, I gotta go.

49:53.228 --> 49:54.377
Bye.

49:57.747 --> 50:00.499
Gonna put it in my pocket.
I'm not answering that.

50:00.586 --> 50:04.021
I'm putting the phone in my pocket.
Put it in my pocket. All done.

50:04.105 --> 50:07.892
OK, everybody, as I climb up
this beautiful tree,

50:07.984 --> 50:10.417
I know we've had our ups and downs.

50:10.503 --> 50:12.777
But as I place this tree topper

50:12.862 --> 50:14.499
in the traditional place,

50:14.581 --> 50:16.492
I just want to say...

50:39.612 --> 50:41.443
Be careful, honey.

51:00.885 --> 51:03.160
Oh, honey.

51:04.364 --> 51:07.275
Honey... I think maybe I can fix that.

51:08.683 --> 51:09.876
I know you're upset.

51:09.962 --> 51:11.793
You picked up on that, did you?

51:11.882 --> 51:15.271
Bud, what is that supposed to mean?

51:15.361 --> 51:17.828
If you weren't working
all the time you'd know.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.353
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

51:20.439 --> 51:23.874
Well, maybe it's not as bad
as being ripped away from your family

51:23.958 --> 51:26.266
- and told you can't see them anymore.
- Dad.

51:26.357 --> 51:29.075
Maybe I invited you here
so Carol can be surrounded

51:29.156 --> 51:32.909
by family for love and support while
I do things you can't even imagine.

51:32.995 --> 51:36.031
Rather than make things work,
you make things worse.

51:36.114 --> 51:37.387
We're leaving.

51:37.473 --> 51:40.430
- What?
- Maybe we shouldn't have come.

51:42.392 --> 51:44.905
Maybe you're right.
You shouldn't have come.

51:46.110 --> 51:48.783
Maybe I should never have come either.

51:48.870 --> 51:51.303
Don't say anything you'll regret.

51:52.508 --> 51:55.544
I think we all need
to cool down for a second.

51:58.786 --> 52:00.617
Why don't you and I take a walk?

52:00.706 --> 52:02.502
Let's go. Let's just go.

52:06.744 --> 52:08.540
Oh, sweetheart.

52:35.454 --> 52:37.012
It's over.

52:37.094 --> 52:42.485
I thought I had a second chance
at having a family, but I blew it again.

52:43.332 --> 52:46.960
Hey. There's no one I know who could
hold this all together but you.

52:47.050 --> 52:48.324
But I didn't.

52:49.450 --> 52:52.521
My in-laws resent me,
Christmas is a disaster,

52:52.609 --> 52:55.406
and my pregnant wife wishes
that she never had met me.

52:56.807 --> 52:59.559
I was gonna wait until tomorrow
to give you this,

52:59.646 --> 53:01.079
but...

53:01.166 --> 53:04.441
I think you need
a bit of a pick-me-up now.

53:04.525 --> 53:06.480
- I can't.
- Come on. Open it.

53:06.564 --> 53:09.396
- I don't feel like it.
- It'll make you feel better.

53:09.483 --> 53:13.714
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, open it, please.

53:13.802 --> 53:15.598
Thanks.

53:17.800 --> 53:20.268
So are there times when you wonder...

53:22.399 --> 53:23.592
Wonder what?

53:23.678 --> 53:26.317
- If this was even...
- Worth it?

53:26.398 --> 53:29.389
More than you know.

53:31.076 --> 53:33.111
Tonight's one of these times, huh?

53:33.195 --> 53:35.390
Wish I'd never put that red coat on.

53:35.475 --> 53:38.943
So... you wish you'd
never become Santa at all?

53:39.033 --> 53:41.910
I wish I'd never become Santa.

53:42.872 --> 53:44.021
At all?

53:45.791 --> 53:48.145
At all. At all.

53:48.230 --> 53:50.107
Yeah, at all.

53:51.349 --> 53:54.385
I wished I'd never been
Santa at all. Happy?

53:55.908 --> 53:57.386
I am now.

54:00.786 --> 54:02.663
No!

54:18.780 --> 54:20.657
Ho ho ho.

54:26.098 --> 54:27.292
Hey, you!

54:27.378 --> 54:29.652
Ho ho... Uh-oh!

54:40.893 --> 54:42.690
Get off me, blubber ball!

54:42.773 --> 54:44.649
I will not let you put on that coat!

54:44.732 --> 54:45.959
Oh, yeah? Watch me!

54:46.051 --> 54:48.042
Don't even think about it, Jack.

54:58.127 --> 55:00.594
You hit me with a shovel!

55:04.205 --> 55:06.035
Adios, fatty!

55:06.884 --> 55:09.113
No, Frost, no!

55:10.722 --> 55:12.678
Oh, no.

55:29.316 --> 55:31.829
OK, so, the Mississippi
factory needs to know

55:31.915 --> 55:35.463
if we want them to ship
100,000 units or 200,000.

55:35.554 --> 55:38.272
They won't ship tomorrow
because it's Christmas,

55:38.353 --> 55:41.230
but they will ship Thursday,
which means...

55:41.312 --> 55:44.189
- They're not gonna ship tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

55:44.271 --> 55:47.342
- This is Christmas Eve?
- Yes, sir.

55:48.270 --> 55:50.305
What are you doing?
Why are we working?

55:50.389 --> 55:52.027
We always work Christmas Eve.

55:53.188 --> 55:54.701
- We do?
- Of course.

55:54.788 --> 55:57.017
Well, that... that's ridiculous.

55:57.107 --> 56:00.143
Christmas Eve is when you
spend time with your family.

56:00.226 --> 56:04.582
- Where's my family tonight?
- I really don't know, Mr Calvin.

56:04.665 --> 56:06.177
What do you mean?

56:06.264 --> 56:07.617
Well, you rarely see them

56:07.704 --> 56:11.218
and you... don't mention them.

56:13.462 --> 56:14.894
Where are my car keys?

56:25.178 --> 56:26.610
Hey.

56:26.697 --> 56:28.688
What are you doing here?

56:28.777 --> 56:31.244
Well, I just came over to see...

56:31.336 --> 56:35.930
See what? Why on earth would you
drag yourself all the way over here?

56:36.014 --> 56:38.323
- Is that Derek?
- No.

56:38.414 --> 56:41.132
- And you're not going out tonight.
- Yeah, OK.

56:41.613 --> 56:44.967
- What are you doing here?
- Came over to see you.

56:45.931 --> 56:47.000
Why?

56:48.570 --> 56:50.686
Cause we don't see
each other enough.

56:52.209 --> 56:54.199
- What?
- Come on, Charlie.

56:54.288 --> 56:55.482
I'm outta here.

56:55.568 --> 56:59.003
- Charlie, it's Christmas Eve.
- Like either of us care, Mom?

56:59.087 --> 57:00.599
- Charlie.
- What?

57:00.686 --> 57:02.517
Come back here. Charlie!

57:02.606 --> 57:05.039
- Good night, Scott.
- Wait, wait!

57:06.125 --> 57:08.433
Can you help me find Carol?

57:08.524 --> 57:10.354
- Carol?
- Carol Newman.

57:11.523 --> 57:14.275
Carol Newman, the principal
of Charlie's school?

57:14.362 --> 57:17.990
- Yeah. Do you know where she is?
- I don't know. She moved away.

57:18.081 --> 57:21.311
Ran out of local kids to terrify,
I guess. I don't know.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.957
What is the matter with you?

57:23.039 --> 57:25.916
Neil. Neil and Lucy,
they'll understand.

57:25.998 --> 57:29.194
- Where are they?
- At the North Pole.

57:29.277 --> 57:30.630
At the North Pole?

57:34.835 --> 57:37.473
Yeah. The North Pole.

57:38.074 --> 57:40.382
- Frost.
- What?

57:40.473 --> 57:43.145
Frost turned the North Pole
into a theme park.

57:44.232 --> 57:46.540
Neil has been taking Lucy
to the North Pole

57:46.631 --> 57:48.781
ever since he and I got our divorce.

57:50.350 --> 57:51.669
Divorce?

57:53.589 --> 57:55.658
Are you sure you should be driving?

57:56.868 --> 58:00.257
I'm gonna make everything OK.
I'll make everything better.

58:01.746 --> 58:03.543
Yeah. OK.

59:09.724 --> 59:11.554
Get a ticket. We were here first.

59:14.043 --> 59:15.554
I hate it. I'm not getting on.

59:15.641 --> 59:18.473
- I'm not made of money, all right?
- Let's go.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.268
<i>Try our gingerbread houses.
They're Santalicious.</i>

59:24.918 --> 59:27.477
<i>Don't forget to buy
a ticket for Santa's show.</i>

59:28.757 --> 59:30.986
Do I look like
a cash machine to you?

59:31.076 --> 59:33.305
I want a dancing Santa!

59:36.794 --> 59:38.352
Keep moving. Come on.

59:38.434 --> 59:40.742
Forget it, that's it.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.709
- I saw it first.
- No, you didn't.

59:43.792 --> 59:45.383
- I'm buying it.
- Give it to me!

59:45.471 --> 59:47.268
- No way!
- Mom!

59:49.990 --> 59:52.662
- Dad, I don't like this.
- That's just too bad.

59:53.949 --> 59:55.540
Hey, stand somewhere else.

59:57.068 --> 59:59.422
You stay right here with me
and hold my hand!

01:00:02.586 --> 01:00:06.214
- I wanna see reindeer.
- Stop pushing!

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.340
- Why are we here?
- Because you wanted to...

01:00:10.423 --> 01:00:12.492
<i>Kids, how much your parents love you</i>

01:00:12.582 --> 01:00:15.255
<i>depends on how much
they spend on your present.</i>

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:17.457
Hurry up, Dad, let's go!

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.168
- Come on, I want a ride!
- Lucy!

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.410
- Neil!
- Scott Calvin.

01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:26.170
Odd place to run into you.

01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:29.890
Luce?

01:00:29.977 --> 01:00:32.171
What's up, Mr Calvin?

01:00:32.256 --> 01:00:33.973
Can we please go?

01:00:34.775 --> 01:00:38.084
Wait, wait, wait. What happened
between you and Laura?

01:00:38.174 --> 01:00:42.086
I know you think therapy is like
witchcraft, but you might consider it.

01:00:42.173 --> 01:00:45.005
Please, please, just tell me.

01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:50.328
You don't really know
because you were never around.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:52.445
It shouldn't be any news to you, Scott.

01:00:52.529 --> 01:00:54.440
You were never a father to Charlie.

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:57.326
You put all the pressure on me,
and guess what?

01:00:57.408 --> 01:00:59.398
He didn't want me to be his father...

01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:04.795
...which messed things up pretty good
between me and Laura.

01:01:04.885 --> 01:01:06.603
Want me to go on, Scott?

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:09.357
Come on, Dad, the line's getting longer.

01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:15.715
Excuse me, sir.

01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.320
- Curtis.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:22.075
Can I offer you two tickets for a turn
to build a toy with Santa's elves?

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.868
I'll throw in this commemorative pen,
voice-enhanced. Cash or credit card?

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.027
<i>- Cash or credit card?
- That's silly.</i>

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:31.835
Not sure, I'll throw in
a pass for the nice list.

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:33.315
Walk with me, won't you?

01:01:33.396 --> 01:01:36.034
Curtis, it's me.
Oh, for the love of candy canes,

01:01:36.115 --> 01:01:37.628
what have you done here?

01:01:37.715 --> 01:01:41.991
Well, sir, this is a nice list kiosk.
The line ends by the petting zoo.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.984
Parents pay to have
their kids put on the nice list?

01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:48.143
Not right. I better change things
back the way they were.

01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:50.061
Who's your boss?

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.708
Where's Frost?

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.022
Curtis, where's Frost?

01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:56.781
- Security!
- Bring Frost out here right now!

01:01:56.868 --> 01:01:58.745
I'll take care of him.

01:02:02.027 --> 01:02:03.584
Look, there's Santa.

01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:07.817
<i>Nice to see you, mon frere.
I've been waiting.</i>

01:02:07.905 --> 01:02:10.054
Has it been 12 years already?

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:13.419
Frost. What have you done?

01:02:13.503 --> 01:02:15.174
Hey. Easy does it, Armani man.

01:02:15.262 --> 01:02:17.775
No hello? Love what you've
done with the place?

01:02:17.861 --> 01:02:19.977
<i>Shave a reindeer for five dollars.</i>

01:02:20.061 --> 01:02:23.893
What about the secret of Santa?
How could you do this to the North Pole?

01:02:23.979 --> 01:02:26.890
The whole thing is way too much work,
too much pressure.

01:02:26.978 --> 01:02:29.253
No one even thanks you
for all the effort.

01:02:29.338 --> 01:02:32.488
No thank yous? What about
the plates of cookies and milk?

01:02:32.577 --> 01:02:34.567
Please, I'm cleansing.

01:02:34.656 --> 01:02:36.885
I stopped the whole
toy delivery nonsense

01:02:36.975 --> 01:02:39.647
and brought anyone
who could afford to pay up here.

01:02:40.454 --> 01:02:43.968
Who needs magic? Who needs to be
crawling on roofs and chimneys?

01:02:44.053 --> 01:02:46.520
I got everything I need right here.

01:02:46.612 --> 01:02:51.081
Look around. This isn't how the North
Pole's supposed to be. This is wrong.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.638
Why don't you chill out
and enjoy the swag, huh?

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.004
This junk is not
what Christmas is about.

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:58.727
- You're the one who gave it up.
- You tricked me.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.924
- Give me a break.
- I didn't know you had my snow globe.

01:03:02.007 --> 01:03:05.157
Maybe not, but who said,
"I wish I'd never been Santa at all"?

01:03:05.246 --> 01:03:06.235
What?

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:09.396
I said, "Who said
'I wish I'd never been Santa at all'?"

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:11.475
Rudolph? Rudolph's mama?

01:03:11.564 --> 01:03:14.316
Frost, switch back with me.
Now's your chance.

01:03:14.403 --> 01:03:16.791
And this is your chance
to enjoy the show.

01:03:16.882 --> 01:03:18.201
- Security.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:18.282 --> 01:03:20.351
Take my guest to his seat, won't you?

01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:22.388
Thanks so much.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.391
Come on, let's go.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.357
<i>Tickets on sale now
for the 6:00 elf toss.</i>

01:03:36.235 --> 01:03:39.112
<i>Never too late to get tickets
to Santa's show.</i>

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.658
Hey, Luce.

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.184
I know something really
wonderful about you.

01:04:10.224 --> 01:04:12.896
- You love snow globes.
- Yeah.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.815
Well, if that's true,
I've got a surprise for you.

01:04:15.902 --> 01:04:17.414
Just up those stairs,

01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:20.094
behind the vending machine
is a secret room

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.091
filled with snow globes
like you've never seen before.

01:04:23.179 --> 01:04:27.729
Beautiful snow globes. There's
a secret code to get in that room.

01:04:27.818 --> 01:04:29.091
What's the code?

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.372
You grab the one in the middle

01:04:38.454 --> 01:04:40.285
and bring it back down to me.

01:04:40.374 --> 01:04:42.170
I need your help.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.483
But I don't want to go
up there all alone.

01:04:46.892 --> 01:04:48.483
Lucy...

01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:50.838
...trust me.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.841
This is really important.

01:05:01.207 --> 01:05:03.356
- OK.
- OK.

01:05:03.446 --> 01:05:06.721
OK. I'll create a little diversion.

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:09.835
Boy, this show stinks.

01:05:09.924 --> 01:05:11.402
Come on.

01:05:11.483 --> 01:05:12.996
Hey, hold it!

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:16.040
- Coming through.
- You can't catch me. Come on, guys.

01:05:16.122 --> 01:05:17.839
Can't catch an old dog like me?

01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:19.639
Lucy? Lucy!

01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:27.997
<i>Grab a seat, everybody.
The show's about to begin.</i>

01:07:38.635 --> 01:07:40.864
Thank you! Thank you!

01:07:44.873 --> 01:07:48.467
I'm gonna kick the coal
out of whoever did that.

01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:52.939
- You.
- You're not Santa Claus.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:55.544
That is an impostor. I'm Santa Claus.

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:58.506
Guards! Guards, get him!

01:07:59.947 --> 01:08:02.858
Bring it on! Who wants
some of this? Come here!

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:06.663
If you don't mind...

01:08:06.745 --> 01:08:09.099
Where are you going?
Get down from there!

01:08:09.184 --> 01:08:11.015
Guess if you guys want me,

01:08:11.104 --> 01:08:13.219
you're gonna have to come up here

01:08:13.303 --> 01:08:15.213
and get me!

01:08:46.932 --> 01:08:48.649
Get this through your head.

01:08:48.731 --> 01:08:51.118
You're not Santa anymore.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.484
You're just a guy
who smells like a cookie.

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:04.121
Hey, how about a game of catch?

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.798
Lucy, toss it.

01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:23.350
Nice try, compadre.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:29.069
And lovely teamwork.
There's only one problem.

01:09:29.158 --> 01:09:31.307
You're never gonna get me to say...

01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:33.627
<i>I wish I'd never been Santa at all.</i>

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:37.263
Now who said that? Rudolph?

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:39.505
Rudolph's mama?

01:09:44.273 --> 01:09:48.823
No!

01:09:58.468 --> 01:10:00.379
Ho ho ho.

01:10:03.427 --> 01:10:05.098
I gotta get my coat back.

01:10:10.025 --> 01:10:11.173
Come here.

01:10:12.344 --> 01:10:14.493
- Boy, you are just...
- Hey!

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.975
- Whoa. Freaky.
- Hey, you!

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.289
Ho ho... Uh-oh!

01:10:27.379 --> 01:10:28.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:36.856 --> 01:10:38.686
Let me go! That coat belongs to me.

01:10:38.775 --> 01:10:41.242
No, Frost, that coat belongs to him.

01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:43.283
You got him!

01:10:43.374 --> 01:10:45.011
This guy was huge.

01:10:45.093 --> 01:10:47.652
- I'm Santa now.
- You don't look like Santa.

01:10:47.732 --> 01:10:50.120
- You killed him.
- Did not.

01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:54.488
- I want my coat.
- Dad, you gotta see this.

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.288
Charlie, Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:58.802
I want the coat!

01:10:58.889 --> 01:11:02.562
'Cause you make such a good Santa?
Because all the elves love you?

01:11:02.647 --> 01:11:04.922
Those people you
took money from love you?

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:09.396
Listen to me, listen to me. Being
Santa's not something you could take.

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:11.759
It's something that chooses you.

01:11:11.844 --> 01:11:14.835
Well... how do I look?
Nice?

01:11:14.923 --> 01:11:16.402
And you're too late.

01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:25.358
No!

01:11:35.317 --> 01:11:36.908
Carol.

01:11:38.156 --> 01:11:39.429
Carol!

01:11:40.915 --> 01:11:43.303
Well, that didn't work out
the way I'd hoped.

01:11:43.394 --> 01:11:45.509
Carol.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:49.028
Oh, Scott.
We've been looking everywhere for you.

01:11:49.112 --> 01:11:50.306
Come here.

01:11:50.392 --> 01:11:52.222
Oh, Mrs Claus, I've missed you.

01:11:52.311 --> 01:11:56.189
- I missed you so much, so much.
- Wait, it's just been a few minutes.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:00.656
- It's only been a few minutes?
- Yes.

01:12:00.748 --> 01:12:04.899
Of course. It only takes a few minutes
to see the truth of an entire lifetime.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.420
- I don't understand.
- A man goes in the world,

01:12:07.506 --> 01:12:10.144
and expects his dreams
to come true, and then...

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:13.375
...the unexpected happens.
Pick up a coat and become Santa.

01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:17.900
That's huge! A lot of pressure, taking
care of the children of the world,

01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:20.859
and the elves and the SOS
and the North Pole,

01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:25.217
but he loses sight of what's important:
The woman who falls in love with him...

01:12:26.219 --> 01:12:29.813
...and gives him a baby.

01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:32.855
- I love being Santa and I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:36.246
- Have you been drinking cocoa?
- No. I'm back.

01:12:37.215 --> 01:12:39.967
- I've missed you very, very much.
- I missed you too.

01:12:43.053 --> 01:12:44.452
Ohh.

01:12:44.533 --> 01:12:46.409
Hey, you guys know what happened?

01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:48.767
- No.
- We ticked each other off. That's it.

01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:51.649
Like families all over
the world do on Christmas Eve

01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:54.244
that love each other,
ticking each other off.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:58.799
They don't have to be perfect to be good
families. We just have to be together.

01:12:59.568 --> 01:13:01.797
I'm still so very sorry

01:13:01.887 --> 01:13:04.719
that we added to all
this pressure that you're under.

01:13:06.246 --> 01:13:08.600
I think that we should apologise.
Don't you?

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:12.472
No. It's good I'm tough on him.
I'm his father-in-law. It's my job.

01:13:12.564 --> 01:13:15.760
As long as you promise to do it
every Christmas, it's fine.

01:13:15.843 --> 01:13:17.912
We'll see about that.
I'm a busy guy.

01:13:18.002 --> 01:13:20.640
And so am I. And I'd like
to show you guys what I do.

01:13:20.721 --> 01:13:22.836
- The SOS.
- The SOS is about secrets,

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.753
secrets aren't for families. I'm tired
of keeping you from your family.

01:13:26.839 --> 01:13:29.830
So if you guys would
follow me to my factory.

01:13:49.152 --> 01:13:50.709
Elves?

01:13:51.951 --> 01:13:54.339
Elves! Stop working for a minute.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.307
I'd like you all to say
hello to the in-laws.

01:13:57.389 --> 01:14:00.346
Hello, in-laws!

01:14:00.428 --> 01:14:02.941
- Hello.
- How ya doin'?

01:14:06.026 --> 01:14:07.664
- Elves.
- Oh, my.

01:14:07.746 --> 01:14:10.020
They're not Canadians. They're elves.

01:14:10.105 --> 01:14:11.617
Never said... in person...

01:14:11.704 --> 01:14:13.660
Listen, if they're elves,

01:14:13.744 --> 01:14:15.574
this is not a toy factory.

01:14:15.663 --> 01:14:18.051
This is probably Santa's workshop.

01:14:18.142 --> 01:14:21.577
- And if this is probably...
- If this is Santa's workshop,

01:14:21.661 --> 01:14:23.730
...then... he...
- Then he's the guy.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.009
Hey, you... you're the guy.
You're Father Christmas.

01:14:28.099 --> 01:14:31.090
It's a little freaky,
but... you'll get used to it.

01:14:32.098 --> 01:14:33.815
- Whoa!
- Oh!

01:14:33.897 --> 01:14:35.125
Whoa!

01:14:35.217 --> 01:14:38.014
If you're Father Christmas
that means

01:14:38.096 --> 01:14:40.245
I'm Father Christmas' father-in-law.

01:14:40.335 --> 01:14:44.293
That means I'm...
I'm Father-in-law Christmas.

01:14:44.374 --> 01:14:46.933
And I'm Mother-in-law Christmas.

01:14:47.013 --> 01:14:48.286
Whoa!

01:14:49.612 --> 01:14:50.931
Whoa!

01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:53.400
Hi, Santa!

01:14:53.491 --> 01:14:54.809
Hi, Bud!

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:58.285
Sylvia.

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:04.003
Oh, the little pellets behind me?
I'll clean those up later.

01:15:04.087 --> 01:15:06.884
Santa, where do you keep
the Phillips screwdrivers?

01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:09.479
Oh, elf construction. Talk to Irv, OK?

01:15:09.565 --> 01:15:10.918
Oh, oh, Cupid!

01:15:12.285 --> 01:15:15.162
At this altitude you might
consider an underdiaper.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.596
I don't mind the draught.

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:20.037
- That was Cupid.
- Yeah.

01:15:20.122 --> 01:15:21.600
Hello, Santa.

01:15:21.681 --> 01:15:24.831
- Father Time.
- Father Time. What next?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.036
Well, hello, Santa.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.155
This is a blast!

01:15:29.239 --> 01:15:30.513
Mother Nature.

01:15:31.718 --> 01:15:34.993
- How can I ever thank you for this?
- Oh, don't thank me.

01:15:35.077 --> 01:15:37.192
- He's the one who brought us here.
- Dad.

01:15:37.276 --> 01:15:38.504
Charlie!

01:15:38.596 --> 01:15:40.074
- Hi, Santa!
- Hey, Tooth.

01:15:40.155 --> 01:15:41.668
- Hi, Santa.
- Sandy.

01:15:41.755 --> 01:15:45.194
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

01:15:45.194 --> 01:15:46.069
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

01:15:46.753 --> 01:15:48.186
Uncle Scott!

01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:52.383
- Lucy, what's happened?
- I found her locked in a closet.

01:15:52.471 --> 01:15:53.460
What's wrong?

01:15:53.551 --> 01:15:56.428
You've got to see what Frost
did to my mom and dad.

01:16:11.825 --> 01:16:13.382
It's gonna be OK.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.734
Yeah, and...?

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.014
Elficers, I have him.

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:32.168
Jack, this isn't funny.

01:16:32.258 --> 01:16:34.214
Unfreeze the parents right now.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:38.005
No way, Claus. I can't unfreeze them
without unfreezing myself,

01:16:38.096 --> 01:16:40.972
and that is something I'll never do.

01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:43.733
Mother Nature, help me out.

01:16:43.813 --> 01:16:46.247
- Can you thaw him out?
- I'm sorry, Santa.

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.800
Our powers don't work
on legendary figures.

01:16:48.892 --> 01:16:51.007
Isn't that a shame?

01:17:09.405 --> 01:17:12.680
- What do you say, Luce?
- Do you think it'll work?

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:16.563
The question is, do you?

01:17:42.874 --> 01:17:45.148
OK.

01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:48.349
This is what you're all reduced to?

01:17:49.992 --> 01:17:52.949
Sending a little girl in
to save the day, are we?

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.266
What you gonna do, adorablise me?

01:17:57.349 --> 01:17:59.499
Sweet me into submission?

01:17:59.589 --> 01:18:01.499
Cute me to death?

01:18:02.588 --> 01:18:05.055
Make me change my... way!

01:18:06.027 --> 01:18:07.345
Hey.

01:18:07.426 --> 01:18:09.461
I feel so strange.

01:18:11.025 --> 01:18:14.141
It's so gushy inside.

01:18:16.423 --> 01:18:17.856
Do I smell suntan lotion?

01:18:18.702 --> 01:18:20.454
I feel so tropical.

01:18:24.301 --> 01:18:26.655
What's happening to me?

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.889
I'm warming your heart.

01:18:28.979 --> 01:18:31.617
But they told me it couldn't be done.

01:18:31.698 --> 01:18:34.894
But they didn't know
about magical hugs.

01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:42.570
I think I like it.

01:19:02.888 --> 01:19:04.639
Mom, Dad!

01:19:04.727 --> 01:19:06.126
- Lucy!
- Mom! Dad!

01:19:09.206 --> 01:19:10.399
Group hug!

01:19:17.963 --> 01:19:19.998
- Feel the love.
- Yes.

01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:57.385
- Oh, Scott. It's time.
- Oh, about 10:00.

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.300
It's time to deliver the package.

01:19:59.389 --> 01:20:00.822
No. Midnight, as usual.

01:20:00.909 --> 01:20:02.864
No, it's time to deliver the package.

01:20:06.747 --> 01:20:10.136
- Yeah.
- It's time to deliver the package!

01:20:10.226 --> 01:20:12.534
Baby Claus is on the way!

01:20:22.822 --> 01:20:26.779
And then the most magical thing of all

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.010
is that I got to deliver

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.977
just before Santa had to deliver.

01:20:32.059 --> 01:20:35.289
Are you telling the stories again?

01:20:35.378 --> 01:20:37.174
So cute!

01:20:37.937 --> 01:20:41.485
Make sure you get to the part about
Santa changing a mean diaper.

01:20:44.255 --> 01:20:45.846
So who got to pick out the name?

01:20:45.934 --> 01:20:48.447
That was easy.
We named him after his grandpa.

01:20:48.533 --> 01:20:52.081
That's right.
Say hello to Buddy Claus.

01:20:53.652 --> 01:20:55.562
What's going on?

01:21:23.841 --> 01:21:26.149
<i>- Keep rolling. Don't cut.
- Ready, boys?</i>

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.195
<i>- Ready?
- Calm down.</i>

01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:31.111
We'll do it right, Marty. Mark!

01:21:31.198 --> 01:21:32.756
Marker. Action!

01:21:32.838 --> 01:21:34.589
Do you like carrot juice?

01:21:35.437 --> 01:21:37.586
Beta carotene gives me a buzz.

01:21:37.676 --> 01:21:39.109
Honey!

01:21:39.196 --> 01:21:42.267
- I'm built for speed and comfort.
- Ohh.

01:21:44.754 --> 01:21:47.028
You... You weird me out.

01:21:47.113 --> 01:21:50.263
Oh, God.

01:21:50.352 --> 01:21:52.819
Look, I'm not gonna... evoke?

01:21:52.911 --> 01:21:54.583
Invoke.

01:21:54.671 --> 01:21:56.820
- Look, I'm not gonna evoke...
- Invoke!

01:21:56.910 --> 01:22:00.106
Easy!
I'm not gonna invoke...

01:22:14.224 --> 01:22:17.454
Frost. He turned the North Pole
into an amusement park.

01:22:17.543 --> 01:22:19.931
Why is that... Why is that funny?

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:21.853
North Pole?

01:22:23.181 --> 01:22:24.409
Is my fly down?

01:22:24.501 --> 01:22:26.730
Frost.

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.246
Is my acting somehow
humorous to you?

01:22:37.057 --> 01:22:40.253
- Well, I'm Santa now.
- Really? You don't look like Santa.

01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:42.973
Well, I am... I'm sorry.

01:22:43.055 --> 01:22:45.010
- That was good.
- That was good.

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:48.130
All of a sudden Rosemary Clooney
showed up. "Well, I am."

01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:00.639
Mother Nature, can you thaw him out?

01:23:01.649 --> 01:23:03.639
Can you thaw him...

01:23:08.806 --> 01:23:10.444
- Tim!
- What?

01:23:10.526 --> 01:23:12.675
I was laughing
'cause it was in the scene.

01:23:12.765 --> 01:23:15.324
- There's no laughing in the scene.
- I was happy.

01:23:16.305 --> 01:23:22.164
