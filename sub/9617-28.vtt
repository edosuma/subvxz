00:53.020 --> 00:54.319
HAH?

00:54.321 --> 00:56.422
EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT

00:56.424 --> 00:57.656
ALL RIGHT, THESE
ARE MY BELIEFS.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.425
WOULD YOU ATTACK

TALKING ABOUT
WHAT MATTERS?

03:34.148 --> 03:35.581
I GOT MY FIRST A.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.450
OKAY, JUDGEY.
YOU GOT A SOLUTION FOR THIS?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.588
YES, I DO.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.890

OUR FRIENDS

AND NOT JUST
ANY SPECIAL
TREATMENT,

03:48.662 --> 03:50.429

COMPLETELY OFF
THE HOOK.

THERE'S NO LESSON
AND NOBODY LEARNS
NOTHING.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.401

ONE OF THOSE
THIS TIME?

03:56.403 --> 03:59.271
SEE YA NEXT WEEK.
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY!

04:04.678 --> 04:07.446

GIVE OUR FRIENDS

04:18.459 --> 04:20.392
SHE DIDN'T LEARN, RILEY.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.561
MAYA, CAN YOU
TELL THEM WHAT
YOU LEARNED?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.730
I ACTUALLY CAN.
THAT'S NEW.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.465
THAT'S NEW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER

04:26.467 --> 04:28.600
HOW SHE LEARNED.
IT'S NEW.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.235
SHE CHEATED!

04:30.237 --> 04:32.137
(incredulously)
THAT WAS LOUD.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.076
"CHEATED" IS A WORD.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS A WORD?

RAILROAD WAS BUILT FROM

DID THE TRACKS MEET?"

05:00.801 --> 05:02.301
NO, I'M WITH
LUCAS, RILEY.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.969
YOU CAN'T
COMPROMISE

FRIENDS.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.571
WATCH ME.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407
NO. WRONG IS WRONG.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.808
SHE DIDN'T
LEARN ANYTHING.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.477
IF SHE HAD LEARNED
SOMETHING, YOU MIGHT
HAVE A POINT.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.846
THEY DROVE IN THE
GOLDEN SPIKE WHEN
THE TRACKS CONNECTED

05:14.848 --> 05:16.448
AT PROMONTORY, UTAH.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.617
QUICK, MAKE A DECISION
BEFORE SHE SAYS
OTHER GOOD STUFF.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.485
LOUISIANA PURCHASE.
MANIFEST DESTINY.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.954
C, C, A, D,
FALSE, FALSE, TRUE!

05:22.956 --> 05:25.424
SHE'S A
STINKING GENIUS.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.492
CHEATING WORKS
FOR HER.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.511
NO.

05:29.512 --> 05:31.529
DAD, IT'S MAYA. YOU
KNOW I'M GOING TO
TURN THIS WORLD

05:31.532 --> 05:33.799
UPSIDE DOWN
UNTIL I MAKE
THIS RIGHT.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.600
I KNOW YOU'LL TRY.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.704
WELL, I STAND
WITH THEM.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.708
YAY!

05:43.644 --> 05:45.377
I DON'T NEED THIS.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.785
(moaning)

05:53.787 --> 05:55.354
NOTHING TO DO, AUGGIE?

06:00.294 --> 06:01.727
OKAY...

06:01.729 --> 06:04.529
WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE PIANO LESSONS?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.365
DOES IT TAKE WORK?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.300
ANYTHING WORTH
DOING TAKES WORK.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.769
THEN I'D RATHER JUST BECOME
A LAWYER LIKE YOU.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.005
YOU DON'T JUST
GET TO BECOME
A LAWYER.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.074
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO BECOME A LAWYER?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.109
PLEASE, NO.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.247
IT'LL JUST HAPPEN.
I'M A CHIP OFF
THE OLD BLOCK.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.915
YOU'RE THE OLD BLOCK.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.052
OH, WELL, THANK YOU.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.654
BUT JUST BECAUSE
YOU COME FROM ME

06:29.656 --> 06:31.523
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU JUST GET
TO BE ME.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.225
YOU HAVE
TO FIND OUT
WHO YOU ARE.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.559
AND IF YOU RUN
INTO ANY TROUBLE,

06:34.561 --> 06:37.162
MAYBE YOU'LL RECONSIDER
THOSE PIANO LESSONS.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.501
(moans)

06:48.342 --> 06:50.609
ARE YOU NOW
OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

06:50.611 --> 06:52.677
A MEMBER OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY?

06:52.679 --> 06:55.680
THE COLD WAR, SIR.
DEMOCRACY VERSUS
COMMUNISM.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.716
YOU GET WHAT YOU
EARN VERSUS EVERYBODY
GETS THE SAME THING.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.585
VERY GOOD, FARKLE.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE
YOUR LIPS MOVE.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.853
BECAUSE MAYA
ANSWERED HERSELF, SIR.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.455
SHE REMEMBERED
THE INFORMATION.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.758
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
TO ME WHEN I CAN
GET IN TROUBLE FOR IT.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.727
WAIT, SO YOU'RE
TELLING ME

07:08.729 --> 07:11.696
THAT IN COMMUNISM
EVERYBODY SHARES
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.064
Farkle:
YES, RILEY.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.466
THE COMMUNIST
PHILOSOPHY IS THAT
EVERYBODY'S THE SAME

07:14.468 --> 07:15.767
AND EVERYBODY
GETS THE SAME THING.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.636
AND IT'S A PARTY?

07:19.206 --> 07:22.107
I WANT SO
DESPERATELY TO
BE PROUD OF YOU.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.308
SO, YOU MEAN

07:23.310 --> 07:25.477
WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T
KNOW SOMETHING ON A TEST

07:25.479 --> 07:26.878
AND SOMEBODY DOES,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.247
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SHARE THAT
INFORMATION?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.081
YEAH.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.550
THAT'S COMMUNISM.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.752
BUT IT'S A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.953
YOU KNOW
THE AMERICAN DREAM?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.104
YEAH.

07:36.105 --> 07:37.254
WELL, THIS IS
THE OTHER THING.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.824
WHAT DO YOU
ALL WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

07:38.826 --> 07:39.991
I HAVEN'T
DECIDED YET.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.660
I SEE YOU AS
A FACTORY WORKER.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.794
WELL WHAT IF I
DON'T WANT TO BE--

07:42.796 --> 07:44.830
I WANT TO BE
A FACTORY WORKER.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.465
I SEE YOU AS
A POTATO FARMER.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.233
BUT I PREFER
THE WARMTH OF THE FACTORY.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.002
CAN I STILL TAKE
OVER THE WORLD?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.504
YOU SURE CAN.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.072
JUST AS LONG AS
EVERYBODY CAN TAKE
OVER THE WORLD WITH YOU.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.708
I'M NOT TAKING OVER
THE WORLD WITH FACTORY GIRL
AND POTATO HEAD.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.444
YOUR INDIVIDUAL GOALS

07:59.446 --> 08:00.445
DON'T MATTER.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.780
YOU'RE ONE OF MANY.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.816
THERE ARE NO
SOCIAL CLASSES.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.084
NOBODY

08:06.086 --> 08:08.820
IS MORE OR LESS
SUCCESSFUL THAN
ANYBODY ELSE.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.822
THAT'S COMMUNISM.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.325
OH, THAT'S COMMUNISM.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.094
I THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN
THEY SCARED THE DEMONS
OUT OF YOU.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.029
THAT'S EXORCISM.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.365
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S THE ONE I HAD.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.502
HE'S KIDDING.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.469
YEAH, I'M KIDDING.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.570
AHH!

08:30.143 --> 08:31.877
OH, IT DIDN'T WORK.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.781
ANYWAY, WHOEVER I AM,
I'M NOT DOWN WITH COMMUNISM.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.350
SURE YOU ARE.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.285
YOU'RE ROBIN HOOD.
TAKE FROM THE RICH,
GIVE TO THE POOR.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.686
DID YOU GUYS
HEAR THAT?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.021
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT MAYA JUST SAID?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.789
I MEAN, SHE
ACTUALLY GETS
THIS STUFF.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.657
MAYA.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.893
YOU REALLY DID
LEARN SOMETHING.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.328
DOESN'T THIS MAKE
YOU WANT TO STUDY
BY YOURSELF?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.898
NO, IT MAKES ME
WANT TO CHEAT OFF
OF EVERYBODY EQUALLY.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.834
YEAH.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.003
WHY SHOULD WE
BE IN COMPETITION
WITH EACH OTHER?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.739
WHY SHOULD WE BE
MOTIVATED BY REPORT CARDS?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.707
WHY SHOULDN'T WE
ALL HELP EACH OTHER OUT

09:02.709 --> 09:04.843
TO KNOW EXACTLY
THE SAME THING?

09:04.845 --> 09:05.810
RILEY...

09:06.847 --> 09:08.146
LOOK AT THIS.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.016
AND CHOOSE YOUR NEXT WORDS
VERY CAREFULLY.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.817
COMRADES!

09:12.819 --> 09:14.185
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE--

09:14.187 --> 09:16.855
COMRADES OF
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
UNITE!

09:16.857 --> 09:18.056
LIGHTNING!

09:18.058 --> 09:18.857
THUNDER!

09:18.859 --> 09:19.824
DARKNESS!

09:19.826 --> 09:20.926
BUNNY RABBITS!

09:22.563 --> 09:23.895
FROM EACH
ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.897
TO EACH
ACCORDING TO HIS NEED!

09:26.833 --> 09:31.236
Both:
WHOA! WE'RE COMMIES.
IT WORKED! YAY!

09:36.543 --> 09:39.044
ANYTHING INTERESTING
HAPPEN AT SCHOOL TODAY?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.946
NOTHING OUT
OF THE ORDINARY.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.716
WANT TO EXPLAIN
RILEY'S OUTFIT?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.518
OH YEAH, SHE'S
A COMMIE NOW.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.954
CAN YOU PASS
THE POTATOES?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.755
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.024
I THOUGHT SHE
WAS A MIME.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.759
MAYA CHEATED
OFF OF FARKLE

09:54.761 --> 09:56.561
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE KNOW STUFF.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.929
SO, YOU'RE A COMMUNIST?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.230
YEAH.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.932
DO I NEED
TO KNOW THE MIDDLE
OF THE STORY?

10:00.934 --> 10:01.866
YOU WANT TO
BE PROUD OF HER?

10:01.868 --> 10:02.601
-YEAH.
-THEN NO.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.903
HONEY, MAYA
DOESN'T KNOW STUFF

10:04.905 --> 10:06.071
IF SHE CHEATED
OFF OF FARKLE.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.273
MOM, YOU CAN'T
CRUSH MY HOPES
FOR HER.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.976
IN THE WORDS
OF THE PRESIDENT
OF COMMUNISM,

10:10.978 --> 10:13.445
"YOU MAY SAY, 'HEY, HEY
I'M A DREAMER,'

10:13.447 --> 10:14.613
"BUT I'M NOT THE--

10:15.949 --> 10:17.215
BUT I'M NOT THE--"

10:18.952 --> 10:21.453
SHH. GO TO SLEEP, RILEY.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.991
RILEY, JOHN LENNON
WAS A BEATLE.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.827
MOM, JUST BECAUSE
HIS BELIEFS ARE
DIFFERENT THAN YOURS,

10:28.829 --> 10:30.996
DOES NOT MEAN YOU
GET TO CALL HIM A BUG.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.566
TEACHER OF THE YEAR!

10:34.568 --> 10:36.501
LOOK WHAT I'M
WORKING WITH!

10:37.604 --> 10:39.838
DOES THE REST OF THE
HONOR BOARD SHARE
YOUR POSITION ON THIS?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.272
NO.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.341
AND MAYA AND FARKLE
ARE GOING ON TRIAL
TOMORROW.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.410
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO NEED SOMEBODY
REALLY GOOD

10:45.412 --> 10:48.079
TO REPRESENT THEM
BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING'S
THIS IMPORTANT

10:48.081 --> 10:49.247
YOU NEED
THE BEST POSSIBLE--

10:49.249 --> 10:49.848
PIANO PLAYER?

10:49.850 --> 10:50.749
LAWYER.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.585
WELL, THAT'S IT THEN.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.088
RILEY, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO FIND A LAWYER

10:57.090 --> 10:59.090
TO DEFEAT DEMOCRACY.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.126
I MEAN, NOT EVEN
IF YOU FOUND SOME

11:01.128 --> 11:04.696
HYPER-COMPETITIVE,
FREAK OF NATURE,
SUPER LAWYER.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.830
(Cory chuckles)

11:05.832 --> 11:07.832
(bones cracking)

11:11.038 --> 11:12.203
OKAY.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.409
I'M SORRY YOU
HAD TO SEE THIS.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.978
LET'S GO.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.346
(patriotic music plays)

11:27.888 --> 11:29.688
WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE
THAT, AUGGIE?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.823
WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE
THAT, AUGGIE?

11:31.825 --> 11:34.492
I ASKED HIM FIRST,
EMMA WEATHERSBEE.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.696
WELL, I CAN ASK
HIM THE SAME AS
YOU CAN,

11:37.698 --> 11:40.065
AVA MORGENSTERN.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.436
HELLO, FRANKIE.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.806
THE AUGSTER.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.675
WHY WOULD YOU
INTERRUPT ME DURING
MY GRAPE JUICE TIME?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.510
I KNOW YOU MIGHT
GET IN TROUBLE

11:52.512 --> 11:55.080
FOR PUSHING
DOMINIC FALCONE
OFF THE SWINGS.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.381
YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT THAT?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.249
EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.151
I'D LIKE TO
REPRESENT YOU.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.020
YOU WANT TO BE
MY MOUTHPIECE?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.822
I NEVER LOST A CASE.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.191
MRS. DUCKSBERRY.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.260
AUGGIE, WELL, DON'T
YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.430
AW, THANKS.
SO DO YOU.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.766
I MEAN, I'M PRETTY
BUT YOU-- YOU'RE--

12:14.768 --> 12:16.267
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE PRETTY.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.069
I-- I'M HANDSOME,

12:18.071 --> 12:18.770
YOU'RE PRETTY.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.604
I'M GORGEOUS.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.905
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.875
SOMEWHERE IN THERE
WAS A COMPLIMENT.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.943
SO THANK YOU, AUGUST.

12:24.945 --> 12:28.213
MY CLIENT,
FRANKIE BIG HANDS,
IS INNOCENT.

12:28.215 --> 12:31.049
HE MAY HAVE PUSHED
DOMINIC FALCONE
OFF THE SWINGS.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.117
BUT--

12:32.119 --> 12:34.018
YOU PUSHED
ANOTHER BOY
OFF THE SWINGS?

12:35.622 --> 12:40.058
FRANKIE-- YOU, ME,
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
RIGHT NOW.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.528
I'LL SEE <i> YOU </i> LATER.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.930
ENJOY YOUR LIFE
TILL THEN.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.433
'CAUSE THAT'S
ALL YOU GOT LEFT.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.575
THE PURPOSE
OF THIS HONOR
BOARD HEARING

12:57.577 --> 12:59.978
IS TO DETERMINE
THE GUILT OR
INNOCENCE

12:59.980 --> 13:02.280
OF MAYA HART
AND FARKLE MINKUS,

13:02.282 --> 13:05.250
WHO STAND ACCUSED
OF SHARING INFORMATION
DURING AN EXAM.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.418
WE'LL BEGIN
THE QUESTIONING
WITH LUCAS FRIAR.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.453
THANK YOU.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.588
MS. HART.
MR. MINKUS.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.258
ARE YOU NOW
OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

13:13.260 --> 13:13.992
A CHEATER?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.059
OBJECTION.

13:15.061 --> 13:15.760
YOU'RE ON OUR SIDE.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.228
BUT WHO'S ON
THEIR SIDE?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.264
WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM
IS IT WHERE PEOPLE ARE...

13:19.266 --> 13:19.998
JUDGED BY?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.065
OTHER PEOPLE.

13:21.067 --> 13:21.933
LIKE A JURY?

13:21.935 --> 13:23.668
WHO ARE STUDENTS
LIKE THEM.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.569
A JURY OF
THEIR PEERS?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.070
YEAH, WHAT DO
YOU CALL THAT?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.005
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.907
YOU AND YOUR ANSWERS.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.008
WELL.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.976
I GUESS I DON'T
HAVE ANYMORE MOVES, DO I?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.245
BY THE WAY,
DEFENSE CALLS MY MOMMY.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.880
(patriotic music playing)

13:38.919 --> 13:39.784
I WIN.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.086
(all gasp)
TOPANGA!

13:43.456 --> 13:44.989
HONEY, YOU CAN'T
JUST COME IN HERE

13:44.991 --> 13:47.292
AND INTERRUPT
OUR VERY FORMAL
PROCEDURE.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.993
I MEAN, THIS IS
THE HIGHEST COURT

13:48.995 --> 13:51.429
OF THE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
MIDDLE SCHOOL LEGAL SYSTEM.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.332
AND WE TAKE OUR
PROCEEDINGS VERY SERIOUSLY!

13:55.202 --> 13:56.000
(gavel squeaks)

13:57.003 --> 13:58.203
ALL RIGHT.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.205
EVERYBODY SIT
WHERE YOU WOULD
NORMALLY SIT.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.539
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN
IS HOW MAYA

14:01.541 --> 14:04.175
COULD'VE CHEATED OFF
OF FARKLE ALL BY HERSELF

14:04.177 --> 14:06.044
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.813
BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE
BY THE CONFIGURATION
OF THE DESKS,

14:08.815 --> 14:10.048
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR MAYA

14:10.050 --> 14:12.851
TO SEE FARKLE'S PAPER
FROM THAT DISTANCE
UNLESS...

14:12.853 --> 14:14.452
SHE HAD SOME HELP.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.386
MR. MATTHEWS.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.788
YES, DARLING?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.690
WHAT IS IT YOU DO
WHILE THEY TAKE
THEIR TESTS?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.291
WHO? ME?
I SIT HERE,

14:20.293 --> 14:21.559
I GET SAD,

14:21.561 --> 14:23.027
I THINK ABOUT
THE WAY THINGS
COULD HAVE BEEN.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.195
CORY!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.330
I'M UP HERE!

14:25.332 --> 14:26.998
YOU KNOW, I-- I--
I READ A BOOK BECAUSE...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.666
YOU KNOW, I--
I TRUST THEM.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.367
UH-HUH.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.802
INTERESTING.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.136
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.505
WELL, I LOOK
AT THE FIRST QUESTION
OF THE TEST,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.541
THEN I MAKE THIS
KIND OF FACE...

14:38.578 --> 14:40.245
THEN I'LL LOOK
AT RILEY WHO'S ALL LIKE...

14:40.247 --> 14:41.646
(humming a tune)

14:42.749 --> 14:44.549
THEN I LOOK AT FARKLE
WHO'S ALL LIKE...

14:44.551 --> 14:45.216
DONE!

14:46.920 --> 14:49.287
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
I MIGHT HAVE LOOKED
AT FARKLE LIKE...

14:53.760 --> 14:55.159
AND FARKLE KIND OF
MIGHT HAVE WENT...

14:57.597 --> 14:58.897
(mouthing)
I LOVE YOU.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.567
INTERESTING.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.070
BUT FROM THIS ANGLE,
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
BLOCKING YOUR VIEW.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.207
YES. SO IT'S POSSIBLE
RILEY MIGHT HAVE WENT...

15:09.209 --> 15:13.144
(humming a tune)

15:14.381 --> 15:17.048
WELL, WE KNEW THAT
FARKLE WAS AN ACCOMPLICE.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.750
I'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR MY FRIENDS.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.385
I ACCEPT MY PUNISHMENT.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.854
BUT I THINK THAT
MRS. MATTHEWS

15:22.856 --> 15:24.722
JUST PROVED
THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.792
YEAH, UH,
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.193
CASE NUMBER 44.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.128
OH BOY.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.095
RILEY.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.364
I WAS KIND OF
AN ACCOMPLICE TOO.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.266
RILEY, HOW COULD YOU?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.936
FARKLE PUT HIMSELF
IN JEOPARDY FOR MAYA.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.404
HOW COULD I NOT?

15:39.406 --> 15:42.040
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF FARKLE SHARED HIS
KNOWLEDGE WITH MAYA,

15:42.042 --> 15:44.943
AND SHE GOT A GOOD GRADE,
SHE MIGHT WANT TO KEEP ON
LEARNING.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.811
AND SHE DOES,

15:46.813 --> 15:49.314
SO IF THAT MAKES US
COMMUNISTS, THEN I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY ARE.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.316
YEAH? WELL, YOU
CERTAINLY LOOK LIKE

15:51.318 --> 15:53.084
YOU'RE ALL IN THE
SAME LITTLE GROUP NOW.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.954
SO WHAT IF MAYBE
WE DRESS A LITTLE
BIT ALIKE?

15:55.956 --> 15:58.589
AND MAYBE SOME
OF MY STUDY METHODS
HAVE RUBBED OFF ON HER.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.191
YOU KNOW
FARKLE'S METHODS?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.794
DAD, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.429
IT'S JUST WHAT
YOU WANTED, RILEY.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.064
COMMUNISM.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.199
FARKLE SHARING HIS
KNOWLEDGE WITH MAYA.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.237
KARL MARX--
THE FATHER OF COMMUNISM.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.874
VLADIMIR LENIN
LED THE REVOLUTION.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.980
THESE GUYS DON'T SEEM
ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH
FUN AS THE OTHER GUYS.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.182
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE THE OTHER GUYS--

16:24.184 --> 16:26.784
JOHN LENNON
AND GROUCHO MARX--

16:26.786 --> 16:29.754
WERE TWO INCREDIBLY
TALENTED, WHAT?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.790
MAYA?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.192
(mimicking Farkle)
INDIVIDUALS, SIR.
THE POINT YOU'RE

16:34.193 --> 16:35.593
TRYING TO MAKE IS
THAT A FREE SOCIETY
BREEDS INDIVIDUALS.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.096
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
YOU'RE DEVELOPING
AS AN INDIVIDUAL?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.931
MAYA, WHY DON'T
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU?

16:39.933 --> 16:41.532
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHO WOULD I SOUND LIKE
BESIDES ME?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.001
I'M STILL ME, RILEY.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ME,

16:43.003 --> 16:44.569
AND I'LL NEVER BE
ANYBODY ELSE BUT ME.
HA!

16:45.505 --> 16:46.537
HA!

16:48.108 --> 16:48.940
HUH.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.217
Auggie:
YOU THINK THIS IS
GOING TO WORK?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.651
IT'S GOT TO WORK.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.186
OTHERWISE,
FRANKIE BIG HANDS

17:02.188 --> 17:04.055
WILL TAKE YOU ON
A LITTLE SWING RIDE.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.357
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT WE MEAN.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.459
ALL RIGHT,
FRANKIE BIG HANDS,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.062
YOU APOLOGIZE
TO DOMINIC.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.865
AND YOUR NEXT INCIDENT
WILL RESULT IN A THREE-DAY
SUSPENSION.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.866
DOMINIC,

17:14.868 --> 17:17.902
IT'S ME, NOT YOU.

17:17.904 --> 17:22.640
NOW, WHERE IS
MY NEXT APPOINTMENT?

17:28.314 --> 17:29.447
WELL, HELLO.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.225
OKAY, WHAT'S THIS?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.128
WE ARE PUTTING UP
A WALL TO PROTECT
OURSELVES FROM THEM.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.031
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.599
IT'S THE JUDGMENT
OF THE HONOR BOARD

17:48.601 --> 17:49.867
TO SEPARATE
THOSE WHO CHEAT--

17:49.869 --> 17:51.402
All:
SHARE!

17:51.404 --> 17:54.105
HEY! WE ALL SAID
THAT AT THE SAME TIME!

17:54.107 --> 17:55.339
I'M HUNGRY.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.776
All:
WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO US?

17:58.778 --> 17:59.644
WHOA.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.281
WE DON'T WANT
TO BECOME LIKE THEM.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.950
WE'D RATHER REMAIN
A FREE SOCIETY
OF INDIVIDUALS.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.152
INSTEAD OF WHATEVER
THE HECK THAT WAS.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.222
BUT ISN'T THE BEST PART
OF A FREE SOCIETY

18:11.224 --> 18:15.426
THE FACT THAT
IT ALLOWS ITS PEOPLE
TO CONSIDER ALL BELIEFS?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.029
YEAH, BUT I WANT
MY FRIENDS BACK,
MR. MATTHEWS.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.363
CAN YOU FIX THIS?

18:19.365 --> 18:23.201
YOU KNOW, I GRADED
YOUR RECENT EXAMS.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.469
MR. FRIAR.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.304
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.171
YOU GET AN A.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.141
MR. BABINEAUX,

18:30.143 --> 18:32.610
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.
YOU GET AN A.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.313
MS. HART,

18:35.315 --> 18:36.647
MS. MATTHEWS,

18:36.649 --> 18:37.315
FARKLE,

18:38.284 --> 18:40.384
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.285
YOU GET A C.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.321
WHAT?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.123
WE GET
A WHAT'S-THAT-YOU-SAY NOW?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.426
HOW DID WE GET
A HUNDRED PERCENT
AND GET A C?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.928
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
GET EVERYTHING RIGHT,

18:50.930 --> 18:54.732
BUT YOU DON'T DO IT YOURSELVES,
IT MAKES YOU AVERAGE.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.668
A DIVIDED BY THREE

18:57.670 --> 18:59.003
IS A C.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.405
Cory:
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.174
YOU'RE AVERAGE.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.643
YOU'RE COMMON.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.412
COMMONISM.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.348
THIS IS WHY IT FELL?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.916
PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO
ALL BE THE SAME?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.351
WITHOUT INCENTIVE,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.286
THERE'S NO MOTIVATION.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.489
WITHOUT MOTIVATION,
THERE'S NO ADVANCEMENT.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.791
IN A TRULY
FREE SOCIETY,

19:20.793 --> 19:23.861
WE SHARE THE BEST
PARTS OF OURSELVES
WITHOUT CHEATING.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.965
BECAUSE WE GET TO
LEARN WHO WE ARE
INDIVIDUALLY.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.968
COME ON, GUYS.
SEPARATELY, YOU'RE
THE BEST INDIVIDUALS

19:30.970 --> 19:32.336
I KNOW.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.037
I MISS YOU.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.540
PLEASE COME BACK.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.643
MAYA?

19:38.645 --> 19:39.544
YEAH.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.847
I THINK I'D LIKE
IT BETTER IF I WAS
DOING WELL BECAUSE

19:42.849 --> 19:44.448
I WAS DOING WELL.

19:51.791 --> 19:52.890
BUT NOW YOU'RE NOT ME.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.892
THERE'S ONLY
ONE OF YOU, FARKLE.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.867
THERE'S ONLY ONE
OF ALL OF US.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.869
IT'S BETTER THAT WAY,
ISN'T IT?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.538
WE WERE FOUNDED
ON THE CONCEPT
OF WELCOMING

20:07.540 --> 20:10.541
ALL PEOPLE FROM
ALL DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THE WORLD.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.543
AND ENCOURAGING
EACH OF THEM

20:12.545 --> 20:14.045
TO FIND OUT
WHO THEY ARE.

20:14.047 --> 20:14.979
WHY?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.481
BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL
IS VALUED HERE.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.951
YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY GOOD.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.394
THERE YOU ARE!

20:31.598 --> 20:32.763
WELCOME BACK, GUYS.

20:40.039 --> 20:40.738
RILEY?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.008
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.511
MR. FRIAR,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.313
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.091
TODAY WAS GOOD.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.627
ONCE AGAIN, FREEDOM
AND LIBERTY HAVE TRIUMPHED.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.229
I WAS JUST EXPLAINING
THE SAME THING TO AUGGIE.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.598
MAKING INDIVIDUAL
CHOICES ISN'T EASY.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.367
THE IMPORTANT
ONES TAKE WORK.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.103
BUT ONCE YOU REALIZE IT,
EVERYTHING TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.038
AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.439
BECAUSE HE'S AUGGIE.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.841
HE ISN'T ME.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.480
FINE, I'LL TAKE PIANO LESSONS.

21:28.221 --> 21:29.287
CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS
TOMORROW?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.989
YEAH, TOMORROW.
YEAH, TOMORROW.
YEAH.
