[Mike sighs]

00:05.744 --> 00:08.051
So, what do you think
your mom's gonna
criticize first,

00:08.138 --> 00:11.881
my hair, my shoes,
the flowers that I got

00:11.968 --> 00:14.275
so she wouldn't make fun
of my hair or my shoes?

00:14.362 --> 00:15.319
I told you not
to bring flowers.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.755
It's a sign of weakness.

00:16.842 --> 00:17.887
Now she's gonna look
for something:

00:17.974 --> 00:20.629
your shoes, your lipstick.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.978
What's wrong with my lipstick?

00:22.065 --> 00:23.197
Nothing.
I think it's great.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.415
It's supposed
to look like

00:24.502 --> 00:25.808
you ate a
popsicle, right?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.375
[water flowing]What are you doing here?

00:27.462 --> 00:29.638
You invited us
to dinner a week ago.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.336
Did I? It must have
slipped my mind.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.208
What is that noise?

00:34.295 --> 00:36.123
Just got a little leak,
no big deal.A little leak?

00:36.210 --> 00:39.735
Sounds like the urinal trough
at the Cubs game.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.476
What the hell happened?!

00:41.563 --> 00:42.433
Probably just
a burst pipe.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.522
I got it under control.

00:44.609 --> 00:45.871
Did you shut off the main?

00:45.958 --> 00:47.264
I was a little busy
opening the door

00:47.351 --> 00:49.832
for people who show up
unannounced.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.094
You invite...!

00:51.181 --> 00:53.923
Never mind.
I'll take care of it.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.753
What's up with your lips?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.146
You been sucking face
with a clown?

00:59.233 --> 01:04.586
Don't you have
bigger fish to fry?

01:04.673 --> 01:06.501
Why didn't you call us?

01:06.588 --> 01:09.634
I can't bother you two with
every little thing that pops up.

01:09.721 --> 01:12.115
Since when? You call Mike every
time the milk smells funny.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.683
I bought it
at that Asian market.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.599
You know how they jimmy
with those sell-by dates.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.427
The water main's off.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.863
That'll stop the flow.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.082
Now we can just focus
on cleaning up.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.084

spread too far,

02:08.345 --> 02:10.042
'cause we do not want
to tangle with mold.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.522
It's bad enough
these old houses are full of

02:11.609 --> 02:13.002
asbestos and lead paint.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.917

Should I be wearing a mask?

Do you own one?

02:17.180 --> 02:20.879
No.
Then no.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.925
Thanks, you guys,
for helping me out.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.883
Of course. Makes no sense
to pay somebody

02:24.970 --> 02:27.059
to patch a hole
in the ceiling.Well, we got to support

02:27.147 --> 02:29.758
a bathtub, lay some tile,
and while we're at it,

02:29.845 --> 02:33.501
we should put in a toilet
that does the job in one flush.

02:33.588 --> 02:36.591
You can't always blame
the toilet, Mike.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.464
Yeah, we shouldn't have
a problem fixing this.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.596
I looked up "bathroom remodel"
on YouTube--

02:41.683 --> 02:43.250
they got everything on there.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.426
Although, I have yet
to find a nunchuk video

02:45.513 --> 02:46.905
with a happy ending.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.952
I just don't understand
how it happened.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.215
I mean, she got the new copper
pipes five years ago.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.783
Brand-new copper pipes
in this worn-out house?

02:54.870 --> 02:57.089
That's like giving an
85-year-old woman a boob job.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.052
Are you serious
about the asbestos
and lead paint?

03:05.315 --> 03:06.795
What do I know?

03:06.882 --> 03:08.057
I just watched
a few YouTube videos.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.625
Who wants pizza rolls?

03:10.712 --> 03:12.322
Oh, thanks, Ma.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.281
Hey, what are you gonna do
while we're fixing this?

03:14.368 --> 03:15.456
You can't stay here.
You got no bathroom.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.109
You kidding?
I grew up on a farm.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.547
Give me a kitchen sink
for washin'

03:19.634 --> 03:21.723
and a bucket for squattin',
I'm good to go.

Careful, careful, man!

03:25.901 --> 03:28.469
Don't get that
on my clothes!

03:28.556 --> 03:29.252
That stuff is toxic!

03:35.171 --> 03:36.738
If we're gonna
get you a new tub,

03:36.825 --> 03:39.349
what do you think about
one of those walk-in ones?

03:39.436 --> 03:41.830
How old
do you think I am?

03:41.917 --> 03:43.658
What does age got
to do with it?

03:43.745 --> 03:45.486

03:45.573 --> 03:48.140
Molly won't even let me
have a chair in the shower.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.449
I'll take a regular tub.
No fuss, no muss.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.538
I just don't understand how
there was that much water.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.061
We couldn't even find
a burst pipe.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.237
What's done is done.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
Who cares about
the why of it?

03:58.803 --> 04:00.152
I just don't want it
to happen again.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.546
It's not gonna happen again.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.809
What if it does, and
you're sitting at that table

04:04.896 --> 04:06.811
when that tub comes
crashing down?

04:06.898 --> 04:09.858
Well, then that son of a bitch
at State Farm'll finally have

04:09.945 --> 04:13.818
to pony up on my life insurance,
and you'll be 15 grand richer.

04:13.905 --> 04:17.518
How can you be so casual
about this?

04:17.605 --> 04:20.912
'Cause it was just
a stupid mistake.

04:20.999 --> 04:24.568
I might have forgotten and left
the water running in the tub.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.962
All night?
You left it running all night?

04:27.049 --> 04:30.008
All night, all day.
I can't keep track
of that stuff.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.359
Ma, this isn't like you left
your porch light on.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.274
You almost turned your house
into an ark.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.146
Look, if it's too much work
for you, Moe and Curly,

04:37.233 --> 04:39.453
I'll hire somebody else.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.455
That's not what I'm saying.Then I don't want

04:41.542 --> 04:42.891
to hear any more about it!

04:42.978 --> 04:44.936
Fine!

04:45.023 --> 04:47.330
Just so we're clear,
of the three of us, I'm Moe.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.859
Ma just left the water running

04:54.946 --> 04:56.426
and was too embarrassed
to admit it.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.385
No big deal.No big deal?

04:58.472 --> 05:01.866
She just gave her bathroom
the world's biggest glory hole.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.263
The house is old.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.787
It doesn't take much
for things to go wrong.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.049
You got that right.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.661
Things get old,
things go wrong.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.968
What is that supposed to mean?

05:17.055 --> 05:18.579
Your mom's getting
up there.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.321
Maybe her check engine light
just came on.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.412
It's not necessarily
her age.

05:25.499 --> 05:29.024
I hate to say it,
but it sounds like
late-stage syphilis.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.770
She's reading a book
on Al Capone.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.468
She thinks everybody's
got syphilis now.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.777
My mother
does not have syphilis.

05:42.864 --> 05:46.520
Still, to be safe, she should
notify all her partners.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.305
No syphilis, no partners,

05:49.392 --> 05:51.133
stop talking.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.743
Well, if you ask me,

05:52.830 --> 05:54.615
it all sounds
a little bit too convenient.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.444
What's convenient about a tub
coming through the ceiling?

05:57.531 --> 06:00.098
Uh, a son that has
to spend every free moment

06:00.185 --> 06:02.231
at his mother's house fixing it.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.668
Is this how your brain works?

06:04.755 --> 06:05.930
No.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.236
It's how hers works.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.498
My brain just figures it out.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.499
Oh, man...

06:09.586 --> 06:11.501
What's still

06:11.588 --> 06:13.416
a mystery to me
is how she rigged that tub

06:13.503 --> 06:15.244
to come through the floor at
the precise moment we arrived.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.202
I'm thinking it has something
to do with, like,

06:17.289 --> 06:21.468
a pre-cut floor and a timer.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.035
You're giving her
a little too much credit.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.242
about all your forgetting...

09:51.329 --> 09:53.593
I'll be in my room.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.163
So, Peggy, uh,

09:59.250 --> 10:00.730
Mike wanted to...

10:00.817 --> 10:03.559
talk to you about what's
been going on lately

10:03.646 --> 10:06.518
with the bathtub
and the, the forgetfulness.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.999
And the...

10:09.086 --> 10:11.219
toplessness.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.700
Mike, you want to,
you want to jump in here?

10:13.787 --> 10:15.658
Ma, we-we love you.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.747
We care about you.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.836
Are-are you going nuts or what?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.316
Mike!

10:21.403 --> 10:23.535
I don't need to sit here
and listen to this.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.626
Well, we just want to talk
and make sure everything's okay.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.062
You're not gonna
put me in a home.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.194
Of course we won't.Of course not.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.805
Yeah, you say that now.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.850
If things get too bad,
we'll deal with it.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.591
Of course we will.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.897
Yeah, worst case, you come
here and live with us.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.638
Well, yeah, I-I...
[stammers]

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
We don't need to get
ahead of ourselves here.

10:40.814 --> 10:44.687
We're not gonna ship her
off to some institution.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.907
I'm not saying that!
Where we gonna put her here?

10:46.994 --> 10:48.691
We're already packed in
like sardines.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.779
This is my mom!
She deserves the best.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.913
We'll stick her in the basement.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.741
Oh, so you can
lock me down there

10:54.828 --> 10:57.439
like some illegal housekeeper?

10:57.526 --> 10:58.658
No, nobody is going
to live in the basement.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.138
This is just a discussion.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.966
Nothing is being decided.

11:03.053 --> 11:06.143
Damn right it isn't,
'cause I'm getting out of here.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.145
Where are my car keys?

11:08.232 --> 11:09.625
Ma, I drove you here.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.761
Let me take a look
at that basement.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.937
Go.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.033
What do they need
all this nonsense for?

11:26.120 --> 11:28.078
They just want to know
your medical history

11:28.165 --> 11:30.994
so they can try to help
figure out what's going on.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.040
All they want is my
Social Security number,

11:33.127 --> 11:35.346
so they can sell it
to the Russians.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.784
I don't think
that's what they do.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.655
But we'll just leave that blank.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.570
Okay...

11:41.657 --> 11:43.572
I'm gonna erase this because
your first name is Margaret,

11:43.659 --> 11:44.834
and not Go To Hell.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.012
Okay, does your family have

11:49.099 --> 11:51.188
a history of any
of the following--

11:51.275 --> 11:52.320
Glaucoma?

11:52.407 --> 11:53.190
Yes.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.192
Oh, okay. Anemia?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.238
Yup.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.892
Seizures?

11:58.979 --> 12:00.502
Oh, yeah.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.069
Really?

12:02.156 --> 12:03.723
My Uncle Jumpy.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.812
If you clicked
on the room light too quick,

12:05.899 --> 12:10.599
he'd flop around the floor
like a fresh-caught carp.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.297
Peggy, I know you're
nervous about all this,

12:13.384 --> 12:15.212
but, you know,
I think a lot of times,

12:15.299 --> 12:17.171
these things
turn out to be nothing.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.868
Really, Dr. Know-It-All?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.957
Is that your prognosis?

12:21.044 --> 12:22.916
You mean diagnosis.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.091
I'm... You know what?

12:24.178 --> 12:26.093
I'm-I'm gonna turn this in.

12:26.180 --> 12:29.487
Okay, I think that's as far
as we can go with the forms.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.402
Oh, fine.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.491
Have seat; we'll call you
when the doctor's ready.Okay.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.971
Um, do you know how
long this might be?

12:35.058 --> 12:37.147
'Cause my mother-in-law
gets a little...

12:37.234 --> 12:38.061
You'll see.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.150
Shouldn't be too long.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.717
Okay. Thank you.Mm-hmm.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.288
Aw, damn it.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.680
We got a runner.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.384
Whew!

12:56.471 --> 12:58.560
After what we saw at
your mom's house,

12:58.647 --> 13:00.605
I'm finally getting
my appetite back.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.175
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about it.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.874
I can still see 'em
when my eyes are closed.

13:07.961 --> 13:12.661
They were so white.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.924
Okay. We were all there.Well...

13:15.011 --> 13:18.536
I'm sorry. I just, you know,
I got to talk it through.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.190
I'm suffering a
little PTS-Double-D.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.758
Enough.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.065
Have you heard from Molly yet?

13:25.152 --> 13:27.719
No. I'm sure if it's anything
serious, she'll call me.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.504
What are you gonna do
if the news ain't good?

13:29.591 --> 13:30.940
What I always do--
stick my head in the sand

13:31.027 --> 13:32.420
and hope it goes away.

13:32.507 --> 13:36.119
Say what you want--
it worked for jury duty.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.817
You're gonna have to
deal with it sometime.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.470
Well, I know,
but what options are there?

13:39.557 --> 13:40.907
Put her in a home,

13:40.994 --> 13:42.430
move in with her,
she moves in with us.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.345
None of these scenarios
is pleasant.Yeah.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.956
I'm gonna have to go through
the same thing with my grandma.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.698
What are you gonna do with her?I have no choice, I got
to do what's right.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.439
Stick her in a home.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.790
How is that right?
Nana raised you.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.748
Yeah, but you see
the way she treats me.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.403
Calling me Black Gilligan.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.581
Sorry, little buddy.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.757
I know...

14:07.890 --> 14:10.719
Uh, if you like, I can discuss
your hurt feelings tonight

14:10.806 --> 14:12.373
when she takes me out to dinner.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.940
She's taking you to dinner?

14:14.027 --> 14:16.290
I probably shouldn't
have said anything.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.726
You see what I'm
talking about?

14:17.813 --> 14:19.249
If she wants to live
her last days

14:19.336 --> 14:20.598
with her loving grandson
taking care of her,

14:20.685 --> 14:22.209
she best start
treating me better.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.994
When I get old,
I'm going back to Senegal.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.691
Really?
Hmm.Oh, yes.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.868
In my country, elders are
treated with respect

14:28.955 --> 14:32.045
and cherished.Aw, that's nice.
Oh. Yeah.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.482
Of course, no one
really lives past 50.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.273
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
...you have visitors in the
main lobby. Dr. Kravitz...

14:43.360 --> 14:44.361
Peggy?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.276
WOMAN:
Yes, sweetheart?

14:46.363 --> 14:49.758
Sweetheart?!
Oh, sorry, wrong Peggy.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.592
Oh. Um, excuse me. Sorry.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.855
Hope... hope that heals.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.813
[short laugh]

15:01.901 --> 15:03.815
Oh, that is never gonna heal.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.949
Lord, I'm not really comfortable

15:07.036 --> 15:11.040
with the non-denominational
makeup of this hospital chapel,

15:11.127 --> 15:12.781
but it'll have to do.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.826
We both know
what team You're on.

15:17.351 --> 15:21.007
Lord, You have given me
so much over the years--

15:21.094 --> 15:22.922
a wonderful home,
a loving son, and I...

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
I thank You for that.

15:25.054 --> 15:28.536
I know You'll do with me
what You will, but

15:28.623 --> 15:30.755
please, please,

15:30.842 --> 15:31.931
don't take my mind.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.020
The last thing
I want to be

15:34.107 --> 15:37.023
is a burden to the ones I love.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.030
Peggy.Oh! Holy hell!

15:44.117 --> 15:47.947
Look what you did-- you made
me swear in the Lord's kiosk.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.819
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.429
I've been searching
everywhere for you.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.170
Oh, I needed to gather
my thoughts.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.346
Or what's left of 'em.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.305
Peggy, I'm... [sighs]

15:58.392 --> 16:02.439
I'm not gonna pretend to know
what you're going through but...

16:02.526 --> 16:04.267
I do think you should
see a doctor

16:04.354 --> 16:06.356
so youknow
what you're going through.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.664
He's just gonna tell me
what I don't want to hear.

16:09.751 --> 16:13.668
Maybe. Maybe not.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.365
Then what am I gonna do?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.977
What if I can't
manage on my own?

16:18.064 --> 16:20.762
You sure as hell
don't want to take care of me.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.330
I don't.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.897
You might want to work
on your bedside manner.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.118
I didn't say I wouldn't.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.078
I said I don't want to, and
you don't want me to, either.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.602
But I will.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.039
No matter how we feel
about each other,

16:37.126 --> 16:40.564
you're still my family.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.828
I guess we are kind of
stuck with each other.

16:46.005 --> 16:52.750
Okay. How about we go upstairs
and talk to that doctor?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.926
Might as well
get our money's worth.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.668
That Medicaid-mooching
bastard'll probably

16:57.755 --> 16:59.409
charge us
for the appointment anyway.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.673
See? There's the woman I
don't want to take care of.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.337
So the doctor said Peggy's
electrolytes were off.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.296
After all that,
she was just dehydrated.

17:16.383 --> 17:20.604
So not looney, just thirsty?Well...

17:20.691 --> 17:23.390
that, and she'd gone off her
blood pressure medication,

17:23.477 --> 17:25.479
so, yeah, kind of
threw her for a loop.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.394
So she'll be back
to normal?

17:27.481 --> 17:31.441
Well, she'll be back to herself;
I'm not sure what you call that.

17:31.528 --> 17:35.315
I guess the takeaway from
all this is, keep hydrated.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.404
L'chaim.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.450
[sighs]

17:40.537 --> 17:42.017
MOLLY: Hey.
What's going on?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.975
A little setback
in construction.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.847
We thought we were cutting
through some old pipes,

17:45.934 --> 17:48.154
and unfortunately,
it was electrical conduit.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.764
Knocked Carl
clear across the room,

17:49.851 --> 17:50.895
but his shoes
stayed on the ladder.

17:50.982 --> 17:54.377
Never seen anything like it.

17:54.464 --> 17:57.119
Again, Ma,
that's Samuel.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.295
Whatever.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.515
Oh, my God. Is he okay?Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
The house,

18:01.602 --> 18:03.343
on the other hand, is gonna be
without electricity

18:03.430 --> 18:05.432
for a few days.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.521
I guess I'll have to
stay with family.

18:07.608 --> 18:11.264
I knew that was gonna
bite me in the ass.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.962
I'll be in the basement.
Call me when dinner's ready.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.358
Where you going?I'm going to her house.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.273
I don't need no
stinkin' electricity.
