01:06.605 --> 01:09.207
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL,
CHANNEL 6 NEWS,

01:09.274 --> 01:11.876
HERE AT THE SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY EXHIBITION

01:11.944 --> 01:13.044
IN MEDIAN PARK,

01:13.112 --> 01:15.346
FEATURING THE LATEST
HIGH-TECH WONDERS--

01:15.414 --> 01:17.548
EVERYTHING FROM COMPUTERIZED
WEATHER BALLOONS

01:17.616 --> 01:19.784
TO SOLAR-POWERED BICYCLES.

01:19.852 --> 01:21.385
BUT THE REAL STAR
OF THE SHOW

01:21.453 --> 01:24.988
IS THE ARMY'S NEW TOP-SECRET
ZEPPELIN AUTO GYRO,

01:25.056 --> 01:27.691
WHICH WILL MAKE
ITS MAIDEN FLIGHT
THIS EVENING.

01:27.759 --> 01:31.595
GENERAL, THE ARMED FORCES
STOPPED USING ZEPPELINS
OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

01:31.663 --> 01:33.396
WHY BRING THEM BACK NOW?

01:33.464 --> 01:36.834
WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT'S
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION,
MISS O'NEIL.

01:36.901 --> 01:39.003
REMEMBER, YOU HEARD IT
HERE FIRST.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.705
AND NOW,
BACK TO OUR STUDIOS.

01:41.773 --> 01:44.274
NOW CAN I FINISH
MY STORY?

01:44.342 --> 01:46.076
AFTER ALL, ZACH AND WALT

01:46.144 --> 01:48.712
NEVER HEARD
THESE TURTLE ADVENTURES.

01:48.780 --> 01:49.947
NEITHER HAVE WE.

01:50.015 --> 01:51.414
AND WE WERE THERE.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.483
ANYWAY, THERE I WAS,

01:53.551 --> 01:56.619
SHREDDER AND HIS
FOOT SOLDIERS MOVING IN.

01:56.687 --> 01:58.254
MY BROTHER TURTLES
WERE NO HELP.

01:58.321 --> 02:00.389
THEY'D BEEN KNOCKED
UNCONSCIOUS.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.391
WRONG. WE PASSED OUT
FROM BOREDOM.

02:02.459 --> 02:04.694
BAG THE STORY,
DONATELLO.

02:04.762 --> 02:08.064
I WANT TO SHOW
THE LITTLE DUDES
OUR SCRAPBOOK.

02:08.132 --> 02:11.968
WOW! A TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLE SCRAPBOOK!

02:12.036 --> 02:13.036
WHAT'S IN IT?

02:13.103 --> 02:15.371
MEMENTOS OF
OUR ADVENTURES.

02:15.438 --> 02:16.973
LIKE, HERE.

02:20.077 --> 02:21.044
A FLOWER?

02:21.111 --> 02:23.479
THAT'S FROM
THE FEMALE NINJA LOTUS.

02:23.547 --> 02:27.181
SHE ALWAYS LEFT A LOTUS
AS A CALLING CARD.

02:27.249 --> 02:29.484
OH, AND THIS
MUST BE YOU GUYS

02:29.552 --> 02:31.085
BEFORE YOU WERE MUTANTS.

02:31.153 --> 02:33.488
WE WERE
JUST BABY TURTLES THEN.

02:33.556 --> 02:36.725
OH, YEAH,
CUTE LITTLE NIPPERS,
WEREN'T WE?

02:36.792 --> 02:38.193
WHO'S THAT GUY?

02:38.260 --> 02:40.461
THAT'S MASTER SPLINTER.

02:40.529 --> 02:43.332
BEFORE THAT RAT SHREDDER
TURNED HIM INTO A RAT.

02:43.399 --> 02:46.068
AND THESE ARE THE MOST
VALUABLE THINGS

02:46.135 --> 02:47.635
IN OUR SCRAPBOOK--

02:47.703 --> 02:50.038
THIS IS THE ONLY MAP
TO OUR LAIR.

02:50.106 --> 02:52.507
WE USED TO GET LOST
A LOT DOWN HERE.

02:52.575 --> 02:55.543
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
BLAB IT TO
THE WHOLE WORLD.

02:55.611 --> 02:59.213
AND THIS IS THE EVIDENCE
OF SHREDDER'S CONSPIRACY.

02:59.281 --> 03:01.015
CONSPIRACY?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.083
IT PROVES THAT
SHREDDER CONSPIRED

03:03.152 --> 03:04.285
TO GET
MASTER SPLINTER

03:04.353 --> 03:06.287
THROWN OUT
OF THE FOOT CLAN.

03:06.355 --> 03:10.224
YOU MEAN
THIS COULD REINSTATE
MASTER SPLINTER

03:10.291 --> 03:11.859
INTO THE FOOT CLAN?

03:11.927 --> 03:14.728
RIGHT--AND THEY'D GIVE
SHREDDER THE BOOT.

03:16.098 --> 03:19.333
I BET SHREDDER
WOULD LOVE TO GET
HIS HANDS ON THIS.

03:19.401 --> 03:22.403
WE MUST PREVENT THAT
AT ALL COSTS.

03:25.274 --> 03:27.574
UGH, WHAT IS THIS?

03:27.642 --> 03:29.576
OH, THAT'S THE CRUST

03:29.644 --> 03:33.246
FROM MY VERY FIRST
SLICE OF PIZZA.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.881
HEY, GUYS,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.916
I'D LIKE
TO FINISH MY STORY.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.486
SURROUNDED
AND OUTNUMBERED,
I ATTACKED.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.320
THE FOOT SOLDIERS
COULDN'T WITHSTAND

03:41.388 --> 03:44.190
THE FORCE OF
MY POWERFUL STROKES.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.525
NICE GOING, DONATELLO.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.428
I'LL CALL YOU
IF I'M EVER ATTACKED
BY A LAMP.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.204
IT'S LATE.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.039
WE GOTTA GO OR OUR PARENTS
ARE GONNA WORRY.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.874
WELL, THANKS
FOR LETTING US SEE
YOUR SCRAPBOOK.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.111
UH, YEAH. AND THANKS
FOR LETTING ME COME ALONG.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.314
THE TURTLES AND I
WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER

04:08.381 --> 04:10.615
YOUR BROTHER'S
BRAVERY, WALT.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.550
RIGHT.

04:11.617 --> 04:14.119
MY BROTHER THE HERO.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.054
I AM CERTAIN
ONE DAY,

04:15.121 --> 04:16.755
YOU WILL SHOW
YOUR BRAVERY.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.156
COME ON, DUDES.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.858
I'LL GUIDE YOU BACK.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.360
OK, SEE YOU LATER,
GUYS.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.301
HEY, THIS AIN'T THE PARK.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.636
HOW ARE WE GONNA SWIPE STUFF
FROM THAT SCIENCE FAIR?

04:32.704 --> 04:34.038
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.840
HOLD IT!
SOMEONE'S COMING.

04:37.542 --> 04:40.077
NOW, JUST TAKE
THE NEXT SEWER TUNNEL
TO THE LEFT

04:40.145 --> 04:42.780
AND YOU'LL BE
NEAR YOUR PAD
WHEN YOU CLIMB OUT.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.082
OH, THANKS,
MICHELANGELO.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.785
WE NEVER WOULD'VE FOUND
OUR WAY OUT WITHOUT YOU.

04:49.821 --> 04:51.589
THAT'S THE WAY
WE LIKE IT.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.458
SO LONG,
LITTLE DUDES.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.693
SO LONG!
BYE!

04:55.760 --> 04:58.362
WOW. WEREN'T THE TURTLES
GREAT, WALT?

04:58.429 --> 04:59.897
I GUESS.

04:59.965 --> 05:02.033
THEY SURE THINK
YOU'RE SOMETHING.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.834
WALT!

05:03.901 --> 05:06.303
THAT'S THE TURTLES'
DOCUMENT POUCH!

05:06.370 --> 05:07.904
WELL, IT FELL OUT
OF THAT SCRAPBOOK,

05:07.972 --> 05:10.140
SO I TOOK IT
FOR A SOUVENIR.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.210
THE TURTLES
DON'T NEED A MAP TO
THEIR LAIR, ANYWAY.

05:13.277 --> 05:15.412
BUT MASTER SPLINTER
CAN USE THAT EVIDENCE

05:15.480 --> 05:18.215
TO CLEAR HIS NAME
WITH THE FOOT CLAN.

05:18.282 --> 05:19.782
OH, YOU GOTTA
GIVE IT BACK, WALT.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.018
NO WAY.

05:21.085 --> 05:23.353
YOU GET TO BE
AN HONORARY TURTLE.

05:23.421 --> 05:24.988
YOU GET A TURTLE COM.

05:25.056 --> 05:26.756
I DON'T GET
ANYTHING--

05:26.824 --> 05:28.758
EXCEPT THIS POUCH.

05:29.961 --> 05:32.996
WALT! COME BACK!

05:33.064 --> 05:36.932
THOSE KIDS GOT A MAP
TO THE TURTLES' HIDEOUT.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.002
YEAH, AND SOME STUFF
ABOUT THE FOOT CLAN.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.703
OOH, IF WE GOT THAT,

05:41.771 --> 05:44.773
I BET SHREDDER WOULD
GIVE US A RAISE.

05:44.841 --> 05:47.375
RAISE WHAT?
HE DON'T PAY US NOW.

05:48.778 --> 05:50.378
YOU SAY
THEY HAVE EVIDENCE

05:50.446 --> 05:52.981
CONCERNING SPLINTER
AND THE FOOT CLAN

05:53.049 --> 05:55.851
AND A MAP
TO THE TURTLES' LAIR?

05:55.919 --> 05:57.152
RIGHT, BOSS.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.021
DON'T LET THEM
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

05:59.089 --> 06:00.356
I'M ON MY WAY
TO JOIN YOU.

06:00.424 --> 06:02.158
IN THE TRANSPORT MODULE.

06:03.593 --> 06:04.960
GIVE THAT BACK!

06:05.028 --> 06:06.994
IT'S TURTLE PROPERTY!

06:10.032 --> 06:12.534
HE MUST HAVE GONE HOME
TO CRY TO MOMMY.

06:12.601 --> 06:14.069
I BET EVEN LITTLE BROTHER

06:14.136 --> 06:16.438
COULD FIND THE TURTLES' LAIR
WITH THIS.

06:16.505 --> 06:18.473
TURTLE POWER!

06:18.541 --> 06:21.476
AND I'M TAKING THIS
BACK TO--

06:21.544 --> 06:23.478
SHREDDER!

06:23.546 --> 06:26.747
I'LL TAKE THAT POUCH,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:26.815 --> 06:28.749
I DO MIND!

06:28.817 --> 06:31.219
BEBOP, ROCKSTEADY!
AFTER HIM!

06:32.988 --> 06:35.856
HEY, WE'RE ON STAGE.

06:35.924 --> 06:38.191
HOW DO I LOOK?

06:38.259 --> 06:40.427
WHO ARE THOSE FREAKS?

06:40.495 --> 06:42.796
I'M GETTING OUT
OF HERE!

06:42.863 --> 06:45.865
WALT, AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU!

06:45.933 --> 06:47.367
YOU ARE?

06:47.435 --> 06:49.369
YEAH. HERE,
TAKE THE POUCH!

06:50.671 --> 06:52.105
I DON'T WANT IT
ANYMORE.

06:52.173 --> 06:53.240
WALT, YOU'VE GOT
TO HIDE IT

06:53.308 --> 06:55.708
UNTIL WE CAN TAKE IT
BACK TO THE TURTLES.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.443
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

06:57.511 --> 06:59.946
UH, I'LL STALL
THOSE CREEPS.

07:00.014 --> 07:02.949
GREAT. WHERE AM I
SUPPOSED TO HIDE THIS?

07:03.017 --> 07:05.551
OH! I'LL HIDE IT
IN THAT CANNON.

07:05.619 --> 07:07.354
THE KID AIN'T HERE.

07:07.422 --> 07:11.390
WOW, LOOK
AT THIS STUFF!

07:11.458 --> 07:13.525
WHAT DO THEE THINK?

07:13.593 --> 07:18.364
I THINK THAT THOU
HAD BETTER FIND
THAT BRAT NOW!

07:18.432 --> 07:19.865
UH, RIGHT, BOSS.

07:22.269 --> 07:23.436
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:23.504 --> 07:25.704
THERE YOU ARE!

07:25.772 --> 07:29.008
COME ANY CLOSER AND
I'LL--I'LL SLICE YOU
TO RIBBONS.

07:30.077 --> 07:32.311
HEY! LET GO OF ME!

07:32.379 --> 07:34.446
SEARCH HIM.

07:34.514 --> 07:36.015
SORRY, BOSS,

07:36.083 --> 07:38.217
NOT A SIGN
OF THE POUCH.

07:38.285 --> 07:40.252
OH, HE MUST HAVE
HIDDEN IT.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.986
TAKE HIM
TO THE TECHNODROME.

07:42.054 --> 07:45.556
KRANG HAS WAYS
OF MAKING HIM TALK.

07:45.624 --> 07:49.461
UNH! YOU CREEPS WON'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

07:49.529 --> 07:51.396
OOH, COME ON, KID.

07:51.464 --> 07:54.466
THIS PLAY HAS GOT
ONE MORE ACT.

07:54.533 --> 07:57.735
YEAH, AND THEN
IT'S CURTAINS FOR YOU.

07:57.803 --> 08:01.072
NOW, TO FIND THAT MAP.

08:06.345 --> 08:09.347
SO,
YOU HAVE THE POUCH.

08:09.415 --> 08:10.615
NO, I DON'T HAVE IT.

08:10.682 --> 08:12.016
LEAVE ME ALONE.

08:12.084 --> 08:13.717
THEN
WHERE'D YOU PUT IT?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.585
YOU WILL TELL ME.

08:15.653 --> 08:16.887
HELP!

08:16.955 --> 08:19.056
THIS IS ZACH CALLING
THE TURTLES.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.224
EMERGENCY!

08:21.559 --> 08:24.962
CAN'T THOSE NUMSKULLS
EVEN HANDLE A BOY?

08:25.030 --> 08:27.131
I'LL DEAL
WITH YOU LATER.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.070
NOT EVEN YOUR FRIENDS
CAN SAVE YOU NOW.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.239
I'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE!

08:35.307 --> 08:37.407
THE SCIENCE FAIR!

08:37.475 --> 08:40.043
I'LL HIDE
IN THE CROWD.

08:40.111 --> 08:43.046
NOW, TAKE THIS BRAT
TO THE TECHNODROME.

08:43.114 --> 08:44.780
I'LL GET THE OTHER ONE.

08:44.848 --> 08:49.118
YOU CREEPS ARE PRETTY BRAVE,
PUSHING A KID AROUND.

08:49.186 --> 08:53.122
HEY, PUSHING KIDS AROUND
IS WHAT WE DO BEST.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.258
THERE HE GOES!

08:55.325 --> 08:56.759
HEY, WATCH IT!

08:56.826 --> 08:58.427
BE CAREFUL!

08:58.495 --> 09:00.629
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

09:00.697 --> 09:03.933
OUT OF MY WAY!

09:04.001 --> 09:07.203
HEY, YOU!
STOP CHASING THAT KID!

09:07.271 --> 09:09.872
ARE YOU GONNA
STOP ME?

09:09.940 --> 09:11.040
NO.

09:11.108 --> 09:14.377
BUT I'M SURE
SOMEBODY WILL.

09:14.445 --> 09:16.211
NOW WHERE DID HE GO?

09:18.547 --> 09:21.316
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
FROM ME THAT EASILY.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.451
I KNOW THESE SEWERS,

09:23.519 --> 09:26.054
AND YOU ARE
A MERE BOY.

09:28.257 --> 09:29.991
I NEED THAT POUCH, KRANG.

09:30.059 --> 09:32.327
MY REPUTATION AS LEADER
OF THE FOOT CLAN

09:32.395 --> 09:33.861
IS AT STAKE.

09:33.930 --> 09:34.996
AND WITH THAT MAP,

09:35.064 --> 09:37.765
I CAN SEEK OUT
AND DESTROY SPLINTER.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.600
I CARE NOTHING

09:39.668 --> 09:42.603
ABOUT YOUR
LITTLE FOOT CLAN

09:42.671 --> 09:44.606
OR YOUR FEUD
WITH SPLINTER.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.875
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DO

09:46.942 --> 09:50.677
THAN EXTRACT
INFORMATION FROM BOYS.

09:50.745 --> 09:53.013
OH, DO THIS FOR ME,
AND I'LL--I'LL--

09:53.081 --> 09:54.348
YES?

09:54.416 --> 09:57.017
I'LL WORK SATURDAYS
FOR A MONTH.

09:58.186 --> 09:59.820
PLEASE?

09:59.888 --> 10:02.589
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU BEG.

10:02.657 --> 10:03.757
ALL RIGHT.

10:03.825 --> 10:06.360
PREPARE THE THOUGHT
EXTRACTOR.

10:07.628 --> 10:11.098
YOU HAVE ONE
LAST CHANCE, BOY,

10:11.166 --> 10:15.169
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
DRAW THAT MAP FOR ME?

10:15.237 --> 10:18.772
WHY DON'T YOU
GO SUCK AN EGG!

10:18.840 --> 10:20.840
AS YOU WISH.

10:20.908 --> 10:24.677
PREPARE HIM FOR
THOUGHT EXTRACTION.

10:24.745 --> 10:27.646
OOH, THIS WILL DRAIN
HIS BRAIN.

10:33.687 --> 10:35.388
SHUT IT OFF!

10:35.456 --> 10:36.289
SHUT IT OFF!

10:36.357 --> 10:37.957
SHUT IT OFF!

10:38.024 --> 10:40.260
BEGINNING
THOUGHT EXTRACTION

10:40.327 --> 10:44.130
ON MUTANT RHINO
AND WARTHOG.

10:44.198 --> 10:46.099
NO DATA TO EXTRACT.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.702
TURTLE POWER!

10:52.071 --> 10:54.240
OHH, WHICH WAY
IS THE TURTLES' LAIR?

10:54.307 --> 10:56.975
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

10:57.043 --> 10:58.243
I'M LOST!

10:58.311 --> 11:01.213
I WANT TO GO HOME.

11:01.281 --> 11:02.781
NO. I MADE THIS MESS,

11:02.848 --> 11:05.117
AND I'M GONNA FIX IT.

11:05.184 --> 11:07.852
YOU CAN'T HIDE
FROM ME, BOY.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.223
NOBODY ESCAPES
FROM SHREDDER.

11:11.291 --> 11:14.192
THIS HAS NOT BEEN
A RED-LETTER DAY.

11:18.231 --> 11:19.631
THESE HAVE TO BE
THE CONTROLS

11:19.699 --> 11:21.733
FOR EVERYTHING
IN THE TECHNODROME.

11:21.801 --> 11:24.435
HUH, LET'S SEE
WHAT THIS DOES.

11:26.037 --> 11:27.271
AND THE SECURITY
GUARD SAID

11:27.339 --> 11:30.241
SHREDDER WAS CHASING
A TEENAGE BOY
THROUGH THE CROWD.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.343
DID HE SAY WHERE
THEY WENT, APRIL?

11:32.411 --> 11:34.412
HE SAID THEY BOTH RAN
INTO THE SEWERS.

11:34.479 --> 11:35.413
APRIL.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.748
UH-OH. I'M ON THE AIR.
I GOTTA GO!

11:37.816 --> 11:38.749
I'M COMING!

11:38.817 --> 11:40.485
A TEENAGER?

11:40.552 --> 11:41.753
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
IT COULD OF BEEN

11:41.820 --> 11:43.521
ZACH OR WALT?

11:43.589 --> 11:44.555
WE'D BETTER
CHECK IT OUT.

11:44.622 --> 11:45.856
LET'S GO.

11:48.593 --> 11:50.761
WHERE'D THAT
LITTLE CREEP GO?

11:50.829 --> 11:54.097
OOH, HE'S GOTTA
BE AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE.

11:54.165 --> 11:55.832
OH, GREAT.

11:55.900 --> 12:00.437
THIS JOINT ONLY GOT
972 ROOMS.

12:00.505 --> 12:04.007
ATTENTION
ALL SCUZZBUCKETS!

12:04.074 --> 12:08.512
PREPARE FOR SUDDEN
SINKING FEELING.

12:12.116 --> 12:14.518
NOW, LET'S SEE WHERE
THEY'RE HEADED.

12:14.585 --> 12:16.319
IT LOOKS LIKE
A LAUNDRY.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.560
OH, NO! NO!

12:23.628 --> 12:25.994
ANYTHING
BUT THE WASHING MACHINE!

12:26.062 --> 12:30.232
AT LEAST NO
SPIN DRYING, PLEASE!

12:30.300 --> 12:34.870
WE TURTLES
ALWAYS FIGHT CLEAN!

12:38.408 --> 12:40.275
THAT'LL HOLD 'EM
FOR A WHILE.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.178
HMM. AUTOMATIC
FOOD DISPENSERS.

12:43.246 --> 12:45.781
I WONDER WHAT'D HAPPEN
IF I TIED THAT

12:45.849 --> 12:48.250
INTO THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.

12:48.318 --> 12:50.219
ALL RIGHT,
WHERE IS HE?

12:53.423 --> 12:58.893
HOW CAN ONE LITTLE BRAT
CAUSE SO MUCH TROUBLE [BURP]?

13:03.999 --> 13:06.734
"EYEBALL MISSILE CONTROL."

13:06.801 --> 13:08.903
I WONDER WHAT
THESE DO?

13:08.970 --> 13:11.805
LIKE, NO SIGN
OF ANYTHING.

13:11.873 --> 13:14.742
WE'VE GOT TO
KEEP LOOKING.

13:18.847 --> 13:22.650
ALL RIGHT, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
COME OUT SLOWLY.

13:23.885 --> 13:24.852
WALT?!

13:24.920 --> 13:26.221
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THERE?

13:26.288 --> 13:28.289
LOOKING FOR YOU GUYS.

13:28.357 --> 13:30.624
LET ME GUESS.
YOU DIDN'T FIND US.

13:30.692 --> 13:32.025
ZACH'S IN TROUBLE!

13:32.093 --> 13:34.194
THEY TOOK HIM
TO THE TECHNODROME!

13:34.262 --> 13:35.862
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

13:35.930 --> 13:39.466
WHY? UH, WELL,
YOU SEE, UH...

13:39.534 --> 13:41.368
LET'S WORRY
ABOUT THAT LATER.

13:41.436 --> 13:44.271
FIRST WE'VE GOT
TO RESCUE HIM!

13:44.339 --> 13:46.740
ALL RIGHT, YOU CREEPS!

13:46.807 --> 13:49.409
IT'S EYEBALL MISSILE TIME.

13:49.477 --> 13:50.611
OH, NO!

14:00.887 --> 14:02.355
BEBOP! ROCKSTEADY!

14:02.422 --> 14:04.890
THAT BRAT PUT ME
IN THE COMMAND ROOM!

14:04.957 --> 14:09.361
OHH, FIND HIM
BEFORE HE WRECKS [BURP]
THIS PLACE!

14:10.464 --> 14:11.898
I'VE HAD IT.

14:11.965 --> 14:14.901
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE
THE WHOLE DAY

14:14.968 --> 14:16.669
LOOKING FOR THAT BRAT!

14:16.737 --> 14:18.270
KRANG MUST HAVE
PULLED THE MAP

14:18.338 --> 14:20.306
OUT OF THE OTHER
KID'S BRAIN BY NOW.

14:22.409 --> 14:25.077
GYROSCOPIC
BALANCE CONTROL. HA!

14:25.145 --> 14:27.413
YEAH! HA. THAT
OUGHT TO SHAKE THINGS UP.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.650
WHAT THE HECK?

14:32.718 --> 14:37.388
THAT KID HAS DISENGAGED
THE GYROSCOPIC BALANCE CONTROL.

14:37.456 --> 14:42.427
STOP HIM BEFORE
THE TECHNODROME
FALLS INTO THE LAVA LAKE!

14:49.067 --> 14:51.302
HELP!

15:03.314 --> 15:05.015
THAT WAS TOO CLOSE.

15:06.184 --> 15:07.851
FOULED UP
BY AN OIL SPILL

15:07.919 --> 15:10.588
AND THWARTED BY
A WET-NOSED KID!

15:10.655 --> 15:14.758
IF ONE MORE
THING GOES WRONG,
I'LL--WHAT?

15:14.826 --> 15:17.394
I TURN MY BACK
FOR 5 MINUTES

15:17.461 --> 15:20.196
AND THE PLACE STARTS
FALLING APART!

15:20.264 --> 15:23.299
RECALIBRATE
THE GYROS.

15:25.269 --> 15:28.271
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR A MINUTE!

15:28.339 --> 15:30.908
WOULD YOU SHUT UP AND HELP!

15:38.248 --> 15:42.251
I SUPPOSE YOU FAILED
TO GET THE MAP
FROM THAT KID'S BRAIN.

15:42.318 --> 15:44.553
AND I SUPPOSE
YOU SUCCEEDED

15:44.621 --> 15:46.489
WHERE WE FAILED?

15:46.556 --> 15:48.324
UH, NOT EXACTLY.

15:48.392 --> 15:51.394
BUT AT LEAST
I DIDN'T LET SOME BRAT

15:51.461 --> 15:54.430
ALMOST WRECK
THE TECHNODROME.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.435
YOU'VE LET SOME BRAT

15:59.503 --> 16:02.405
STEAL OUR ONLY
TECHNOROVER.

16:02.472 --> 16:03.739
NO MATTER.

16:03.807 --> 16:05.708
HE'LL NO DOUBT
GO BACK FOR THE POUCH

16:05.776 --> 16:08.042
IN ORDER TO RETURN IT
TO THE TURTLES.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.212
THIS SURVEILLANCE DRONE
WILL KEEP TRACK OF HIM

16:11.280 --> 16:14.850
AND STEAL THE POUCH
WHEN HE GETS TO IT.

16:19.421 --> 16:22.858
OF COURSE, IT WOULD
HELP IF WE KNEW WHERE
THE TECHNODROME WAS.

16:22.925 --> 16:24.359
WHICH WE DON'T.

16:24.426 --> 16:25.861
OH, GREAT.

16:25.928 --> 16:28.463
WHICH WAY
DO WE GO NOW?

16:28.531 --> 16:29.998
LISTEN.
[CAR APPROACHING]

16:30.065 --> 16:32.233
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A VEHICLE.

16:32.301 --> 16:34.402
STAND BACK, WALT.
WE'LL HANDLE THIS.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.705
IT'S A TECHNOROVER!

16:36.772 --> 16:39.440
TURTLE POWER!

16:39.507 --> 16:41.976
LET'S STOP THIS GUY
IN HIS TRACKS!

16:42.044 --> 16:44.712
ALL RIGHT, SHREDDER,
THIS TIME YOU'RE ZACH!

16:44.779 --> 16:45.746
ZACH?

16:45.814 --> 16:47.648
HI, RAPHAEL!

16:47.716 --> 16:49.450
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN A TECHNOROVER?

16:49.517 --> 16:51.051
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

16:51.118 --> 16:53.554
WHERE DID YOU HIDE
THE DOCUMENT POUCH?

16:54.890 --> 16:57.357
POUCH?
WHAT POUCH?

16:57.425 --> 16:59.259
WHAT'S GOIN' DOWN, DUDES?

16:59.327 --> 17:02.763
WALT, UM,  BORROWED
THAT DOCUMENT POUCH.

17:02.831 --> 17:04.097
HE DID WHAT?

17:04.165 --> 17:06.133
WELL, THAT'S WHY SHREDDER
WAS AFTER US.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.935
WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH IT, WALT?

17:08.002 --> 17:11.436
I HID IT IN THE MOUTH
OF THAT CANNON
IN THE PARK.

17:11.505 --> 17:13.472
IT'S GUESS IT'S
STILL THERE.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.241
THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO HEAR!

17:15.308 --> 17:17.710
TO THE TRANSPORT MODULE!

17:25.185 --> 17:26.819
GENERAL, YOU STILL
HAVEN'T EXPLAINED

17:26.887 --> 17:29.022
THE PURPOSE
OF THIS STRANGE VEHICLE.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.958
WE'RE CERTAIN
THAT CITIZENS

17:32.026 --> 17:33.893
WILL SLEEP BETTER
JUST KNOWING

17:33.961 --> 17:36.295
THAT IT COST
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

17:36.363 --> 17:37.897
WHAT ABOUT SECURITY?

17:37.964 --> 17:39.164
AFTER TODAY'S DISTURBANCE,

17:39.232 --> 17:41.166
HAVE ANY SPECIAL MEASURES
BEEN TAKEN?

17:41.234 --> 17:44.736
WE'VE GOT THIS PLACE
LOCKED UP TIGHTER THAN
A DRUM, LITTLE LADY.

17:44.804 --> 17:48.073
NO ONE'S GOING TO--
WHOA-OA!

17:51.044 --> 17:53.378
TURTLES,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:53.446 --> 17:55.313
SORRY, APRIL,
CAN'T TALK.
BUSY DAY.

17:55.381 --> 17:57.182
AHEM. LET ME REPEAT--

17:57.250 --> 17:59.051
THE ARMY IS IN CONTROL

17:59.119 --> 18:01.486
AND THERE'S
NO NEED FOR PANIC.

18:07.227 --> 18:10.229
THE TURTLES ARE
AFTER THE POUCH!
GET THEM!

18:10.296 --> 18:13.164
I ALMOST GOT IT.

18:13.232 --> 18:14.632
GET AWAY FROM THAT CANNON!

18:14.699 --> 18:18.002
HOW ABOUT IF I JUST GET
THE CANNON AWAY FROM US?

18:23.008 --> 18:25.242
ROCKSTEADY,
HOLD OFF THE TURTLES.

18:29.981 --> 18:33.751
SAY YOUR TURTLE PRAYERS,
SHELLBACKS!

18:33.818 --> 18:36.854
THAT GUY'S, LIKE,
A MAJOR PAIN.

18:36.922 --> 18:38.756
LEONARDO, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

18:38.823 --> 18:41.725
TO STOP
THOSE CHOPPER-NAPPERS.

18:41.793 --> 18:44.460
OH, LET ME OFF AT
THE CORNER, DRIVER!

18:48.132 --> 18:49.065
THANKS.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.668
I HAVE IT NOW.

18:56.607 --> 18:59.609
MICHELANGELO AND DONATELLO
ARE TRAPPED IN THERE.

18:59.677 --> 19:02.779
I'VE GOT TO HELP
STOP THIS.

19:02.847 --> 19:06.215
THIS IS THE LATEST THING
IN FIRE-FIGHTING FOAM.

19:06.283 --> 19:08.151
IT NOT ONLY
PUTS OUT BLAZES,

19:08.218 --> 19:10.353
IT ALSO HAS
A MINTY-FRESH SCENT.

19:10.420 --> 19:13.489
I HAVE
TO BORROW THIS
FOR A MINUTE.

19:13.557 --> 19:15.891
HEY, COME BACK!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:15.959 --> 19:18.060
OH, I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT...

19:18.128 --> 19:19.895
I THINK WE'RE COOKED.

19:19.963 --> 19:22.397
YOU SURE ARE.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.398
I'M GOING TO WHIP UP

19:23.466 --> 19:26.001
A COUPLE OF
FRENCH-FRIED TURTLES.

19:26.069 --> 19:28.070
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

19:28.138 --> 19:29.672
OH, YEAH?

19:29.739 --> 19:31.840
WHO'S GONNA
TO MAKE ME?

19:31.908 --> 19:33.441
I AM!

19:37.747 --> 19:40.149
I HATE THIS!

19:40.216 --> 19:42.451
WAY TO GO, DUDE.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.521
THANKS FOR THE LIFT,
FELLA!

19:46.589 --> 19:49.123
NO FREE RIDES,
CHUMP.

19:51.427 --> 19:53.361
NICE OF SOMEBODY
TO REMEMBER ME.

19:53.429 --> 19:55.763
COME ON, WE'RE GOING
TO GROUND THOSE CREEPS...

19:55.831 --> 19:56.998
FOR KEEPS!

19:57.066 --> 19:58.900
HURRY UP, BOSS.

19:58.968 --> 20:01.836
THIS THING'S GETTING HEAVY.

20:01.904 --> 20:04.072
I ALMOST HAVE IT.

20:10.179 --> 20:13.080
LEONARDO,
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
THAT CANNON IS LOADED?

20:13.148 --> 20:16.050
OH, IT CAN'T BE.
IT'S 100 YEARS OLD.

20:20.321 --> 20:24.091
WELL, EVEN LEADERS ARE WRONG
ONCE IN A WHILE.

20:24.158 --> 20:25.926
ARE YOU OK, BOSS?

20:25.993 --> 20:29.763
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE WORST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

20:29.830 --> 20:32.165
BUT AT LEAST I GOT THE MAP.

20:32.233 --> 20:34.001
NOW WE CAN KICK BACK

20:34.068 --> 20:36.036
AND COOL OUT
FOR A CHANGE.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.371
WHAT ABOUT SHREDDER?

20:37.438 --> 20:39.907
HE COULD BE
ON HIS WAY HERE RIGHT NOW!

20:39.974 --> 20:41.775
YOU NEVER
GOT THE MAP BACK.

20:41.842 --> 20:43.176
WHO SAYS WE DIDN'T?

20:43.244 --> 20:46.880
I SUBSTITUTED A PHONY MAP
BEFORE HE EVEN GOT THERE.

20:46.948 --> 20:48.248
SPEAKING OF SHREDDER,

20:48.316 --> 20:49.816
HE SHOULD
BE DROPPING OUT

20:49.884 --> 20:52.017
OF THE PICTURE
JUST ABOUT NOW.

20:52.085 --> 20:57.089
THERE, THAT MUST BE
THE DOOR TO THEIR LAIR.

21:01.628 --> 21:05.731
ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS THE TURTLES'
LAIR, BOSS?

21:05.799 --> 21:07.900
SHUT UP AND SWIM.

21:07.968 --> 21:12.071
TURTLES, IT WAS WRONG
OF ME TO TAKE YOUR MAP.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.006
PLEASE DON'T
TAKE IT OUT ON ZACH.

21:14.074 --> 21:16.842
AH, FORGET ABOUT IT,
LITTLE DUDE.

21:16.910 --> 21:19.111
YES, IT WAS WRONG,

21:19.179 --> 21:20.946
BUT IT TURNED OUT WELL,

21:21.014 --> 21:23.848
AND YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO SHOW YOUR TRUE COURAGE.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.850
THAT'S WHY
WE'VE DECIDED...

21:25.918 --> 21:28.419
THAT YOU CAN BE
THE SIXTH TURTLE.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.754
YOU MEAN IT?

21:31.857 --> 21:34.025
YOU GUYS
ARE THE GREATEST!

21:34.093 --> 21:37.695
YEAH. NOW ALL WE NEED
ARE A SEVENTH
AND AN EIGHT TURTLE

21:37.763 --> 21:40.565
AND THE FOUR OF US
CAN RETIRE.
