[narrator]  Previously on  Riverdale:

00:09.801 --> 00:12.595
[Toni] You wanna get through this?
Hang with the Serpents.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.306
You think you can come to my house
and there wouldn't be payback?

00:15.390 --> 00:18.268
[Alice] I'm wondering
when you're gonna actually address

00:18.351 --> 00:20.895
the real problem in Riverdale,
the Southside.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.733
[Fred] We need to be united.
If we let the fear take over, we're dead.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.693
I want a more active role
in Lodge Industries.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.987
Of course. You're a Lodge, after all.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.115
-Everybody needs to leave.
-The Black Hood is coming.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.660
This is from the Black Hood.
He says he's doing it for me.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.204
-Hello?
-[man]  Hello, Betty.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.249
This is the Black Hood speaking.

00:41.916 --> 00:42.792
How--?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.588
How do I know this is real?

00:47.088 --> 00:50.633
-"I will strike next where it all began."
-Were you there?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.428
-At the Town Hall?
-Oh, yes.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.638
But you didn't hurt anyone?

00:56.639 --> 00:58.308
Tonight was all about you.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.726
What do you want?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.269
The same as you.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.439
To set Riverdale
on the righteous path again.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.483
To cleanse it of sinners.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.236
-Isn't that what you want?
-Not by killing people.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.988
Only the ones who deserve it.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.532
People like your sister.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.870
I know about
the sin she carries in her womb.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.957
I also know she's at a farm
two hours north.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.794
If you try to warn her, I'll know.

01:26.085 --> 01:30.465
If you tell the police we've spoken
or your mystery-loving boyfriend,

01:30.548 --> 01:32.675
I'll carve her like a jack-o'-lantern.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.844
Please, don't hurt her.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.182
-Who are you talking to? It's late.
-Then don't you deny me.

01:39.265 --> 01:42.268
-It's Jughead, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.729
I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.316
Now he's living on the Southside
amongst criminals and degenerates.

01:48.399 --> 01:52.779
He's showing his true colors. No doubt
inspiring your stunt at Town Hall.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.990
-Pulling the fire alarm?
-I didn't know what else to do.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.785
Given the letter the Black Hood sent.

01:58.868 --> 02:02.831
If he even wrote it.
Sheriff Keller says something seems off.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.625
He's gonna have it analyzed
with the one I got.

02:05.708 --> 02:09.671
In the meantime, I want you home
straight after school. Are we clear?

02:09.754 --> 02:11.464
Yeah. Sorry, Mom.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.052
[Archie] I did what Weatherbee asked.
Wrote an apology

02:16.136 --> 02:18.805
and posted a new video
apologizing some more.

02:19.264 --> 02:23.059
So, this, uh, Red Circle business,
it's over?

02:24.561 --> 02:25.854
I'm happy to hear it.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.234
I've been missing my son.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.364
[phone chimes]

02:42.745 --> 02:46.124
I need to tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone else.

02:46.207 --> 02:50.169
Not Veronica, not Jughead, not your dad.
Just no one. You promise me?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.005
Yeah, sure. I promise.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.798
The Black Hood called me.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.677
-What?
-No, keep walking.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.055
Wait. The Black Hood called you?

03:01.139 --> 03:04.851
Yes, it's risky for me to be telling you,
but we're best friends.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.021
We live right next door.
Us walking to school together

03:08.104 --> 03:11.316
would look normal
to anyone watching, including him.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.527
-You think he's watching us?
-He could be.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.990
-I know it sounds crazy, but it was him.
-Tell the police, even if it's not him.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.535
It is him. He told me if I went
to the police or told Jughead--

03:23.870 --> 03:25.872
God, he knows where Polly is, Arch.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.542
-If he calls, I have to answer.
-I won't let you go through this alone.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.884
"This most recent incident confirms
that the real threat is not the Black Hood

03:37.967 --> 03:40.720
but the Southside
and its corruptive forces.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.015
Developer and ex-con Hiram Lodge

03:44.098 --> 03:48.061
boasts his SoDale project will revitalize
the forsaken neighborhood,

03:48.144 --> 03:50.355
but this reporter speculates Hiram Lodge

03:50.438 --> 03:53.149
doesn't want to fix our problems,
merely profit from them."

03:53.233 --> 03:56.319
Right before our open house.
Thank you, Alice Cooper.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.490
We can't let anything derail this project.

04:00.573 --> 04:04.035
Not Alice, not the Southside gangs,
not some hooded psychopath.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.829
Well, right now,
our biggest problem is capital.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.831
We're running out of it and fast.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.919
I've invited investors to the open house.
The St. Clairs from New York.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.506
Wait. They are? Nicky included?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.300
I haven't seen Nicky in forever.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.847
Yeah, he's a budding music producer now.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.767
And his father is King Midas rich.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.144
We get him to invest, others will follow.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.980
You wanted a seat at the table.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.148
Nick has his father's ear.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.109
Help us close this.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.070
Show him all the good things
Riverdale has to offer.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.030
With pleasure.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.409

04:45.243 --> 04:47.161
[Fogarty] Sweet Pea. Take care of this.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.290
-Nice article your girlfriend's mom wrote.
-I saw that.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.543
Dilton Doiley was stabbed
and you jumped him?

04:53.626 --> 04:56.087
The idiot stabbed himself
with his own knife.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.339
[Sweet Pea] We didn't jump him.
There was a fight.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.383
Bulldogs versus Serpents. See this?

05:01.301 --> 05:05.054
Andrews gave it to me before
his girlfriend shot a gun into the air.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.473
-What happened?
-And, of course,

05:07.557 --> 05:11.227
Northsiders get off scot-free,
the rest of us are hauled in by police.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.564
-It's payback time.
-What are you guys talking about?

05:15.732 --> 05:18.067
What is--? What is that?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.529
Is that a pipe bomb?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.491
Fogarty's cousin served in the Army.
He's gonna build us something.

05:25.575 --> 05:30.204
We'll do it after hours.
It'll shut the  Riverdale   Register  down.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.707
You think blowing up
a building will make things better?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.210
-Can't get any worse.
-Yeah, Sweet Pea, it can.

05:37.295 --> 05:42.258
-Let me talk to Archie, figure this out.
-That's your answer for everything. Talk.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.761
We don't know who you stand with.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.221
Us? Or them?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.311
You can't be half a Serpent.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.781
Great. So, Archie started World War III.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.700
Northside has been
dumping on us for years.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.369
Your dad tried to keep the peace.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.288
Avoid bloodshed.

06:12.371 --> 06:16.667
Now that he's gone, idiots like Sweet Pea
think there's one path and solution.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.836
Violence.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.677
Nick and I were the
"will-they-or-won't-they" of our jet set.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.472
He's an outrageous flirt,
but we never dated.

06:29.555 --> 06:33.017
We'd hop from club to club,
go on these madcap adventures,

06:33.101 --> 06:34.185

06:34.268 --> 06:37.313
-Who's this now?
-Oh, Archiekins, don't be jelly.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.483
It's just a ghost
from my bad-girl past, Nick St. Clair,

06:40.566 --> 06:44.445
breezing to town for the open house.
You have nothing to worry about.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.044
I think this Northsider's lost.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.171
I'm not.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.508
I'm over being half a Serpent.

07:06.175 --> 07:10.221
Wow. You'll do anything to protect
your Northside buddies.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.933
My father was a Serpent.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.685
He led you.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.896
I wanna stand with you guys.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.528
Tall Boy was the one
who gave me this jacket.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.572
It's finally time I start wearing it.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.703
So, now you wanna be a Serpent, huh?

to do the same with Jug.

-Please, don't hurt her.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.524
Then give me another name.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.485
-Right now.
-What?

41:27.568 --> 41:30.821
If you wanna save your sister,
give me another name.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.448
The name of someone guilty.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.159
Come on, Betty. One little name.

41:35.242 --> 41:37.411
I won't. I can't do that.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.080
Then I'll kill your sister,
and your mother,

41:40.164 --> 41:43.209
and your father,
and everyone you hold dear.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.128
Nick St. Clair.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.508
He's staying at the Five Seasons.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.721
I told you, we were the same.
