01:22.666 --> 01:24.509
How did you do that?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.762
A magician never reveals his secrets.

01:27.838 --> 01:31.513
Then I'll have to pierce your shell
and gaze within.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.761
You understood.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.852
Chan Ho Yin.

01:38.682 --> 01:39.854
Raina.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.527
I would love to see that fire trick again.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.026
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.402
Of course not.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.822
It's a great idea.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.200
I'm sorry for the clutter.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.126
- I'm in between places.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.794
How long have you been here?

01:59.870 --> 02:02.339
Six years. Beer?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.717
You seem to have an appreciation
for the greats.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.394
I idolized him for many years.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.222
And now?

02:19.056 --> 02:22.606
There is no real magic there.
Just tricks.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.403
And what you do, those aren't tricks?

02:26.730 --> 02:28.448
Show me.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.906
I'm sorry.
I really shouldn't.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.535
Says who? What are you afraid of?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.285
It's not me who's afraid.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.214
That can't be real?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.634
See for yourself.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.847
How long have you been able to...

02:55.926 --> 02:57.974
First time was a few years ago.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.772
A dish towel caught fire in my hands.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.849
I almost burned down
my entire apartment.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.023
And it doesn't hurt?

03:06.103 --> 03:08.276
Not even a little.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.195
You have a gift.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.997
I've never seen anything like it.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.041
Why not show the world?

03:20.575 --> 03:23.624
I ask that same question every day.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.206
There are people who...

03:26.665 --> 03:27.962
Never mind.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.964
It's just...

03:30.585 --> 03:34.180
For years, I did illusions.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.883
Tricks, like the rest.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.015
And then this happens. It's real.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.726
Real magic.

03:41.805 --> 03:46.481
If I believed in such things,
I would say it was a miracle.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.312
That this happened for a reason.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.489
I believe you've been chosen.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.401
You do?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.783
Close your eyes,

03:59.489 --> 04:01.207
and I'll show you.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.337
That'll do.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.444
Every decision you make
from here on out has consequences.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.116
So be warned.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.619
The kiddie gloves are off.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.996
G-7.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.291
Hit.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.710
Yes! Ha!

04:47.788 --> 04:51.258
So explain to me again
what this has to do with my training.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.802
It's important for every S.O.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.096
to evaluate their student's
thought process.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.172
Mmm-hmm.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.091
And I like board games. B-10.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.802
Nope. This isn't thinking.
This is stabbing in the dark.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.434
But it's nice to take a break
from the workouts.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.814
You deserve a break.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.484
I gotta give Coulson credit.

05:09.559 --> 05:13.063
Never would have pegged
an ex-Rising Tide hacker as a good fit,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.740
but you're picking things up pretty fast.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.069
Did you just give me a compliment?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.119
I... No, I made a comment.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.572
A kind one.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.951
Did it physically hurt to do that?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
Do you need an ice pack?

05:28.411 --> 05:31.665
Wow. A compliment and a smile.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.840
Comment.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.714
I don't want to ruin the moment,

05:34.793 --> 05:37.137
but I'm gonna have to respond with...

05:37.712 --> 05:38.759
G-4.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.973
- Say it, Ward.

05:45.804 --> 05:46.976
Say it.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.851
- You sank my battleship.
- Yes!

05:50.934 --> 05:53.278
- All right, best two out of three.
-I beat you!

05:53.353 --> 05:55.230
- Best two out of three.
-Best out of one.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.530
She's fitting in nicely.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.484
- Gloating?
- A little.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.570
You were up early this morning.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.748
Heard you puttering around
even before I started tai chi.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.204
Having trouble sleeping?

06:07.284 --> 06:11.130
No, I feel great.
Just have a little extra energy to burn.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.709
If you want,
I could lay out the mats downstairs.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.046
We could go a few rounds.
Like the old days.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.597
Saved by the bell.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.358
Chan Ho Yin.
Just a struggling street performer

06:31.433 --> 06:32.480
until a few years ago

06:32.559 --> 06:36.154
when Mr. Chan began to exhibit
moderate pyrokinetic abilities.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.481
So what gave him powers?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.612
It's still under investigation,
but Chan did live

06:39.691 --> 06:42.410
near the decommissioned Wan Tai
nuclear plant when it caught fire.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.362
To our knowledge,
no other nearby residents

06:44.446 --> 06:46.164
have exhibited similar traits.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.491
So how did we find out about him?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.918
Informant saw him lighting torches
in a street show.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.336
With his pinky.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.413
Brought it to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attention.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.498
We told him to keep his abilities
under wraps.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.256
- He's been on the Index ever since.
-The Index?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.508
It's a list S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps
of people and objects with powers.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.090
Wait, what? How many are there?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.267
- Are you saying there more people...
-Not many.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.594
Well, enough to keep a list.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.428
A short list. Meant to protect them.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.264
Though in rare cases,
S.H.I.E.L.D. has had to take action.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.101
Action against objects or people?

07:15.852 --> 07:19.106
Well, that's drastic
with a side of creepy.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.657
How are they monitored?

07:20.732 --> 07:23.781
Tapped phones? Satellite surveillance?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.118
Body probes
in dark, unpleasant places?

07:27.197 --> 07:28.198
Body probes?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.784
Now that's ridiculous.
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't do that.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.460
We don't do that, do we?

07:33.036 --> 07:34.037
The methods vary.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.873
Mr. Chan was low risk.
He was assigned a case agent

07:36.957 --> 07:38.630
who checked in with him
every few days.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.631
That's how we discovered him missing.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.391
Everyone, this is Agent Kwan,
Chan Ho Yin's case agent.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.593
What can you tell us?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.179
Not much, I'm afraid.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.811
Chan is a magician, so, at first,
I thought he'd made himself disappear.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.643
The file says you'd caught him
violating his Index agreement before.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.478
On two separate occasions.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.485
Claimed we were
"hampering his artistic expression."

08:01.564 --> 08:04.818
But late last night,
he was taken by professionals.

08:05.402 --> 08:09.623
The only thing they left behind
was this scrap of aluminized material.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.870
Fire-proof clothing.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.748
So whoever took him
knew about his power.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.330
Yes. We think we know why.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.165
In the last few days,

08:18.248 --> 08:21.172
tech division discovered a crack
into our data stream.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.800
It's the same cyberpunks
who hacked us before.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.639
Somehow they got in again.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.592
It's the Rising Tide.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.150
Hello? It got real quiet.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.816
- You guys still there?

08:42.772 --> 08:46.493
The Rising Tide is a huge organization
of hacktivists from all around the world.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.491
Any of them could've done this.
It wasn't me.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.038
- No one's saying it was.
-But you're thinking it.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.786
I can see your faces thinking it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.162
We're assessing the situation.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.788
Then I'm sure you're taking into account

08:54.868 --> 08:57.041
that I have been living on a plane
with you this whole time.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.373
It would be impossible
for me to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.335
Or easier.
We're gonna need more than that.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.091
Fine. Let me trace the hack,
and I'll prove it.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.888
I believe her, sir.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.549
And if she's telling the truth,

09:09.632 --> 09:12.431
we need to track down
the person responsible.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.268
Dig up something, and fast.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.441
The longer Mr. Chan's missing,
the more danger he's in.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.109
- Good morning, Chan.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.488
What the hell?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.116
I apologize for last night.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.744
It was important I bring you in
under the radar.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.908
Oh. S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.955
Tell Agent Kwan I don't need
to be read the Power Protocols again.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.711
It was just a street performance.
It's not like I set anyone on fire.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.341
I don't work for S.H.I.E.L.D.
I come as a friend.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.092
English isn't my first language,

09:48.171 --> 09:50.674
but that word means
something different than you think.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.885
I understand your frustration.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.220
But I believe you have a gift.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.521
And if you let me,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.349
I'd like to help you nurture it.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.730
I can increase it.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.608
You'll get people's attention then.

10:03.686 --> 10:07.281
Increase my power?
Why? What's the catch?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.444
I'd like to run some tests.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.870
There it is.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.324
Now, will you let me go,
or must I fight my way out?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.826
Leave now, and I'll forget you.
I promise.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.082
But so will everyone else.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.008
Stay and you can be remembered.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.799
Known the world over.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.757
You want to make
Chan Ho Yin a famous name?

10:31.840 --> 10:36.721
No, you need a simpler name,
a more powerful name.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.225
A name like

10:39.889 --> 10:40.890
"Scorch."

10:40.974 --> 10:44.069
"Scorch?" Are you joking?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.896
Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.859
No. But Captain America,
now, he's on the news,

10:50.942 --> 10:53.570
and a lunchbox,
and a poster on the wall.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.779
I don't want to be a superhero.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.834
You want to be recognized for your gift.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.333
And who is more recognizable
than them?

11:02.412 --> 11:05.040
I was given this power for a reason.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.342
I just want people to see what I can do.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.760
They will.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.260
All I want is what you want.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.725
For you to be remembered.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.098
To be seen for what you're meant to be.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.606
A star.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.358
Scorch?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.236
It's growing on me.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.207
- How close are we?
-Almost there.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.001
She's identified
the remote access Trojan

11:42.076 --> 11:44.625
-and the infected endpoint.
-Yeah, and is searching for a TCP

11:44.704 --> 11:46.798
to correlate a hypertext
with signature information,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.796
-and then, voilà!
-Bob is your uncle.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.877
- You get any of that?
-Only the uncle part.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.884
We got our origin. Austin, Texas.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.964
You got a name?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.392
Just the café our hacker worked out of,
but I'm in the system.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.969
I'm gonna check to see
if any credit card charges

11:59.052 --> 12:02.101
from that day match up
with any known hackers.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.266
We got a hit.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.025
Miles Lydon. Not Skye.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.398
- That's to all of our relief.
-You know him?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.071
Every hacker in the world knows him.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.569
Not just the hacker world.
He infiltrated the Kremlin.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.027
Yeah, the picture of Putin shirtless
on horseback,

12:15.109 --> 12:16.361
that was his hack.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.242
It was also his hack
that got Chan kidnapped.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.664
May, set a course for Austin.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.703
- Just did.
-What about Chan?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.456
Kwan's got a S.H.I.E.L.D. team
on the ground.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.162
Our best bet is to chase this thing
from the other end.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.965
Find Mr. Lydon, bring him in,
see what he knows.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.137
Just left the café where Miles logged in.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.141
Cashier says she hasn't seen him
in over a week.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.642
I may have eyes on him.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.034
I've been made.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.451
Heading East on 5th Street.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.960
Target is now in a silver Jetta.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.796
I got him.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.278
- All right, suit, you asked for it.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.445
Gridlock Protocol.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.454
I lost him.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.376
Are you sure they're not following you?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.922
Yeah, had to pull out
all the stops though.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.641
Thanks for the text.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.343
Wait, are you mad?

14:04.427 --> 14:05.679
Are you kidding me?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.519
I don't have much time.
Who did you leak those files to?

14:08.598 --> 14:09.850
Wait a second, what?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.809
"Good to see you, too, Miles."

14:12.685 --> 14:14.813
I released them into the world
where they belong.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.524
They'll keep hunting you unless
they have someone else to look for.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.609
And why the hell
would you hack S.H.I.E.L.D.?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.281
Because that's what we do.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.829
Not when I'm on the inside.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.657
You could have ruined everything,
you dumb-ass.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.912
Seems like you handled it.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.834
I've come too far for you to...

14:29.911 --> 14:32.539
Why are looking at me like that?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.211
Did you just call me "dumb-ass"?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.718
Stop smiling. I'm serious.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.720
Because I taught you
everything you know,

14:42.799 --> 14:45.393
-so what does that make you?
-No, you didn't.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.101
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.649
I've been missing you like crazy.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.166
That's where you keep that, huh?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.672
Better safe than busted.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.424
Making any progress on that?

15:20.503 --> 15:23.848
Digging, but your little stunt
is gonna make it harder.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.517
Where's my top?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.764
You know, I could be helping you.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.472
If you send me cipher-text,
I can be working on algorithms...

15:30.555 --> 15:33.149
No, I can't contact you.
I never should have.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.942
There's a S.H.I.E.L.D. team looking
for you right now.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.736
My team. And if they suspect
something, I'm screwed.

15:37.812 --> 15:38.938
There's a joke here.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.991
That I'm resisting.
That involves the word "screwed."

15:42.066 --> 15:44.285
Shut up. There's a guy in trouble
because of you,

15:44.360 --> 15:45.452
and I got to get back.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.281
So if you want to help me,
help me find my clothes.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.456
Hey.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.836
I'm sorry, Skye. Really, I am,
if I messed anything up.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.504
I've missed you.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.081
Me, too.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.753
But we talked about this
when I left for L.A.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.303
I've got a chance here.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.130
So S.H.I.E.L.D. is off limits.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.510
- Okay?
-Okay.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.097
At least tell me what it's like.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.804
Come on, the belly of the beast.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.515
Surprisingly un-beastly.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.350
I've got good people I'm working with.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.435
Some good stories though, I hope.

16:17.518 --> 16:21.022
Miles. You have no idea.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.775
But that's classified.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.327
- You did not just say that to me.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.404
Come on, you got to tell me something.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.705
Someday.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.788
Well, if they ever let you go on leave
or whatever,

16:32.867 --> 16:36.371
let me know,
and I'll get us a suite at the...

16:36.454 --> 16:38.127
Fancy hotel that has suites.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.300
And you can regale me with stories
while naked.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.718
A suite? You? That's funny.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.171
But they're never gonna let me go
on anything

16:45.254 --> 16:47.222
if I don't find my stupid...

16:50.593 --> 16:51.936
Top.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.310
Get dressed.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.031
I know how this looks...

17:11.948 --> 17:14.201
How long have
you two been in contact?

17:14.282 --> 17:16.911
I contacted him once the day I joined
to tell him I was okay

17:16.993 --> 17:19.713
and once earlier today.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.507
When you tipped off an active suspect?

17:21.582 --> 17:22.878
No, it's not like that.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.213
Miles and I, we met
when we were both a little screwed up.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.424
Scratch that. He was a little screwed up.
I was a lot.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.386
But we looked after one another.
That's why I warned him.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.186
Not because
we're working together on this,

17:34.262 --> 17:37.186
but because we're friends.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.943
I'm really sorry.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.773
Noted. If not you,
then who is Mr. Lydon working with?

17:44.855 --> 17:46.277
No one. He's an idealist.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.109
Believes in freedom of information.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.444
That information
cost a man his freedom,

17:49.527 --> 17:51.621
and you sabotaged our attempts
to remedy that.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.370
No, I came here to find out
what Miles knows about Chan.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.745
- And?
-Nothing.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.919
Miles is a dead end. He's harmless.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.086
We'll see.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.914
Really. I was gonna find out
everything I could to try to help.

18:01.998 --> 18:05.047
I felt like I couldn't
tell you guys everything.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.800
I know.
That's why I asked May to follow you.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.340
Seems that wasn't a dead end.

18:16.679 --> 18:21.435
Why would Skye do this to us for him?
I thought she was our friend.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.487
I think she is, Fitz.
He's just obviously more than that.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.314
Yeah, but we've been through
so much together,

18:26.397 --> 18:29.492
and she didn't even tell us
that she has a guy.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.366
Well, who knows what
they've been through together?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.949
The classified information
you stole from us,

18:36.032 --> 18:37.784
who did you give it to?

18:37.867 --> 18:40.746
It's information. It has a life of its own.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.626
What happened to Mr. Chan?

18:42.705 --> 18:45.208
I don't know who that is.
So why don't you tell me?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.303
So are you guys just gonna destroy
all my stuff'?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.630
Yes.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.346
Anything?

18:54.425 --> 18:55.802
I don't have to talk to...

18:55.885 --> 18:57.262
Take him in.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.981
Gather all the evidence
and secure the prisoners.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.650
We got what we were looking for here.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.819
We're going to Hong Kong.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.358
I'm so sorry, Ward.
This is not what it looks like...

19:10.441 --> 19:11.567
Hands.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.253
Now get up.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.970
Uh, you missed a button. I'm sorry.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.519
What is this big place, Raina?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.350
And who are these guys?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.027
They'll assist you
with anything you need.

19:47.269 --> 19:51.319
We're here to monitor your vitals
while we observe your powers.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.949
And it's big
because we'll need the space.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.747
This serum strengthens
the cytoskeleton

19:58.823 --> 20:00.791
within each cell of your body.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.587
One dose, and you'll feel incredible

20:05.287 --> 20:06.834
until it wears off.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.259
- And it will wear off?
-Yes.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.430
But the effects in average subjects
has been impressive.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.850
In you, I'm excited to see.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.137
What do you think
of the name "Scorch"?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.650
Breathe.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.730
Feel it?

20:31.814 --> 20:34.363
Now let's see what you can do.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.993
Whoa.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.389
Oh, sorry,
you almost got scorched.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.350
This is incredible!

20:59.592 --> 21:00.844
Whoo!

21:01.177 --> 21:02.599
You are a beautiful angel,
you know that'?

21:02.678 --> 21:06.273
Your power is an amazing gift.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.271
And S.H.I.E.L.D. wouldn't let me use it.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.854
But thanks to you, the whole world
can finally see what I can do.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.487
From now on, nobody holds me back.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.130
So I guess due process
isn't really S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.802
They don't have time for it.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.845
Whoa, are you defending them?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.798
These people are denying
our basic rights!

21:38.881 --> 21:40.474
This isn't about us!

21:40.549 --> 21:42.301
They're trying to save someone's life.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.636
Listen to yourself.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.814
That's what they always say
to justify invading privacy, Skye.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.017
These people stand
for everything we despise.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.476
Secrets, censorship...

21:50.559 --> 21:51.981
Enough with the manifesto, Miles!

21:52.061 --> 21:54.109
We can't let them get away with it!

21:54.188 --> 21:57.658
Manning, Snowden, Aaron Swartz,
these are modern day revolutionaries.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.735
This has nothing to do with that.
You leak...

21:59.819 --> 22:02.493
--The guy's hiding behind platitudes.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.744
He's dirty. I can feel it.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.247
Scrubbed clean, actually.
Nothing much on him.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.624
He's got no family records.
His apartment's under an alias.

22:09.703 --> 22:13.333
And he plays a lot of Minecraft
where he runs a rather nasty mob.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.416
What, as a zombie?

22:15.084 --> 22:16.711
Zombie pigman.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.430
Keep looking.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.431
Go ahead. Say it.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.142
I don't do petty.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.727
But you called it.

22:32.810 --> 22:36.064
I trusted my gut
even though you said she was a risk.

22:36.146 --> 22:40.071
When someone breaks into my house,
I usually don't invite them to stay.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.993
- But that's me.
-That was me, too.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.039
Then that alien staff
went through my heart.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.037
Sure it didn't go through the brain?

22:47.783 --> 22:50.787
You don't really do comforting either,
do you?

22:52.162 --> 22:55.166
What is your gut telling you now?

22:57.918 --> 23:00.046
That she's still hiding something.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.599
Sir, we found some evidence.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.607
She's been defending you,
saying you're a stand-up guy.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.859
So I'm going to give you a chance.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.191
You want to tell her, or should I?

23:20.274 --> 23:21.742
I don't have to listen to you...

23:21.817 --> 23:23.740
There goes your chance.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.536
Your boyfriend here
made a few deposits

23:27.615 --> 23:30.164
in the days following the leak.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.081
All said,

23:33.329 --> 23:35.297
it's about a million dollars.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.419
What?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.466
- Real stand-up guy.
-I can explain...

23:38.542 --> 23:40.590
Did you sell information?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.763
Miles? Yes or no?

23:44.048 --> 23:45.265
- Did you?
-Yes, but...

23:45.341 --> 23:47.844
Oh! You are so dead!

23:47.927 --> 23:49.144
What the hell were you thinking?

23:49.219 --> 23:51.221
It was a million dollars.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.975
A million dollars.
it would change my life.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.602
Our lives.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.063
And that woman was harmless.
I looked into it.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.400
No one with good intentions
pays that kind of money for information.

24:02.483 --> 24:03.860
Did you ever think about that?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.661
Of course I did.
I never would have done it if I thought...

24:05.736 --> 24:07.283
Who's the woman you referred to?

24:07.363 --> 24:08.956
A fan of the Rising Tide.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.500
Some rich girl in a flower dress.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.833
She knew all about me, said I had a gift.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.086
She thought people like us
deserved more.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.587
Oh, you deserve more.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.669
She pointed me
to a Chinese S.H.I.E.L.D. feed,

24:21.752 --> 24:22.799
wanted me to crack it.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.130
You thought that was harmless?

24:24.213 --> 24:25.214
I checked the data stream.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.096
It didn't seem like anything you and I
hadn't already put out there, Skye.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.722
And I traced the account
where the money came from

24:29.802 --> 24:31.554
to make sure
it wasn't some evil corporation.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.937
It was just an eco-research lab.
Otherwise, I would never...

24:35.015 --> 24:36.358
Ecological research?

24:36.433 --> 24:39.858
Yeah, insects.
Some study with centipedes.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.575
What's more harmless than that?

24:48.404 --> 24:52.625
It appears the volatility
in the serum has been neutralized.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.874
I'm surprised you got him to cooperate.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.705
He has dreams.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.131
I told him they'd come true.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.128
You gave him a name, didn't you?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.589
Everyone wants to be remembered.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.185
Thank God no one's gonna have
to actually call him that.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.934
You were right.
The platelets in his blood

25:14.013 --> 25:16.607
prevent the EXTREMIS in the serum
from combusting.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.777
That's fantastic.
The others will be pleased.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.488
Good work, Raina.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.575
Now drain him.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.304
it appears Centipede is responsible
for Mr. Chan's kidnapping.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.680
First L.A., now Hong Kong.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.478
What kind of organization
are we dealing with'?

25:54.553 --> 25:58.729
International, well-financed,
interested in creating a super-soldier.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.686
Let's hope finding Mr. Chan
will provide some answers.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.897
Using the account information
Mr. Lydon gave us,

26:03.979 --> 26:06.323
S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ believes
he's being held here.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.492
Any ideas
what Centipede wants with Chan?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.491
Hard to say, but Simmons thinks
that considering he's pyrokinetic...

26:11.570 --> 26:12.867
There's a good chance his genetics

26:12.946 --> 26:15.574
could stabilize the EXTREMIS element
of the Centipede serum.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.160
- Keep the test subjects from going...
-Boom!

26:18.243 --> 26:20.462
If Mr. Chan is Centipede's lab rat,

26:20.537 --> 26:23.632
we need to get there
before the experiment's over.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.550
This is no test. This is torture.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.430
Thank you for your participation.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.683
Our group really owes you one.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.021
I won't let you...

26:49.525 --> 26:51.198
What have you done?

26:51.276 --> 26:53.779
We don't understand
what gave you this ability.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.990
But the reason you don't burn

26:56.073 --> 26:58.872
is because your blood platelets
are fire-resistant.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.170
Which is why we're removing them.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.206
Take this upstairs.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.713
Raina, you said I have a gift.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.383
And you're giving it.

27:11.672 --> 27:12.844
Raina!

27:13.966 --> 27:15.138
Raina!

27:17.469 --> 27:19.972
Agent May and I will be handling
the field work.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.808
You stay and oversee the prisoners.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.017
Sir?

27:24.726 --> 27:26.319
I was Skye's S.O.
it was my responsibility...

27:26.395 --> 27:28.898
It was my call
to bring Skye onto the plane.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.858
And you warned me against it.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.239
My problem. I fix it.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.581
I'm sorry. I honestly didn't know.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.288
All our talks.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.165
Did you mean none of it?

27:42.244 --> 27:45.043
I risked everything to help you,
and it turns out

27:45.122 --> 27:47.841
every word out of your mouth
since we met is total crap.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.964
- That's not true.
-"Democratization of knowledge."

27:50.043 --> 27:53.047
"The truth will set you free."
The truth sure as hell came out

27:53.130 --> 27:54.302
I believe in all of those things.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.850
I just don't know
why they have to go hand in hand

27:56.925 --> 27:58.518
with barely scraping by.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.517
Come on, Skye.
You lived in your van for the last year...

28:00.596 --> 28:01.848
Now, you're making fun of my van?

28:01.930 --> 28:05.400
I could have funded us for years! Us.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.694
So you wouldn't have
to sacrifice your principles,

28:07.769 --> 28:10.488
joining this corrupt institution
to find what you're looking for.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.032
What's wrong with me trying to do that?

28:12.107 --> 28:15.111
I'll tell you what's wrong with that.
An innocent guy might die.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.537
For money.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.741
You know
I'd never intentionally hurt anyone.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.668
I'm just trying to get my life together.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.498
At least you know
what you're looking for.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.468
Me? I don't have that.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.171
For a long time, I thought it was you.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.383
I guess I was wrong.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.470
I guess so.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.974
Building has five floors.
The first four are research.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.186
Fifth is listed as maintenance
but uses half the building's energy.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.362
Either they're guarding
the world's largest vacuum...

28:50.437 --> 28:51.939
Or that's where Chan's being held.

28:52.022 --> 28:55.652
Send your B and C teams in through
the tunnels to secure the lower floors.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.237
Warn them that the Centipede serum
is highly explosive.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.539
Understood. Where do we go in?

29:01.865 --> 29:03.162
The roof.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.386
There. Heat signature confirmed.

29:16.797 --> 29:17.923
I love these things.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.610
- Agent Kwan, it's you.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.616
We're hereto get you out.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.128
Strike team needs
a security override, stat.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.213
Kwan, can you arrange...

30:03.927 --> 30:06.146
Chan, what have you done?

30:06.221 --> 30:08.098
I've set myself free.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.490
Coulson's in trouble.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.159
Mr. Chan, I know you're in pain.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.117
This is nothing.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.498
You were the ones killing me,

30:29.578 --> 30:33.048
forcing me to keep
this gift locked up inside.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.659
So we're good, right?

31:05.739 --> 31:07.491
The entire facility's been locked down.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.167
- Are you sure about this?
-No.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.994
This is pretty cool.

31:11.078 --> 31:13.877
The alarms disconnected the system
from all exterior sewers.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.207
Can you fix it or not?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.008
Yes, but you've gotta get me on site.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.381
- No way.
-Not a chance.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.011
You're a hacker, Skye.
Not SEAL Team Six.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.182
No,

31:25.092 --> 31:26.935
but he is.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.030
His file say anything
about him being homicidal?

31:39.106 --> 31:41.074
Just said he was kind of a tool.

31:41.483 --> 31:44.157
Mr. Chan, believe it or not,
this could still get worse.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.989
You bend someone long enough,
and they break.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.456
Poor little Chan Ho Yin
may have believed your lies,

31:51.535 --> 31:53.333
but not Scorch.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.755
Who?

31:54.830 --> 31:57.674
Oh, crap. They gave him a name.

32:00.836 --> 32:01.962
Give me a clean look.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.889
I'll make sure he wakes up
in a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.717
Waking is optional at this point.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.603
I'm out.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.905
Nothing can stop me.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.608
Where are we on the doors?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.905
Almost there.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.868
S.H.I.E.L.D. has infiltrated the building.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.874
No, it's under control.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.465
Didn't want to tell them?

32:38.540 --> 32:41.043
Chan's true nature has revealed itself.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.595
Without his platelets,
the serum will combust.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.264
Wouldn't be the first one
to blow up on you.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.766
I'm beginning to think you're bad luck.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.403
- How long is this gonna take?
-Done.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.732
Doors are unlocked.
Where's Chan?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.816
- He's gone.
-Damn it!

33:04.900 --> 33:07.494
That tranquilizer was his last chance.
You know that.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.492
I know.
It's time to minimize the damage.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.165
Simmons, are the building's computers
back online?

33:14.075 --> 33:15.076
Yes.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.504
Uncuff Miles.
We're going to need his help.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.178
- You!

33:26.004 --> 33:27.722
I wish you all the best.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.182
Please.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.105
Look, we can fix you.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.267
Make you stronger.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.656
Take the name "Scorch"
and make it mean something.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.028
It already does.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.452
No!

34:07.546 --> 34:10.094
Mr. Chan, we don't want to hurt you.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.223
But we have to.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.521
We gotta move.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.571
You need to drive the blast
into the main ventilation shaft.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.496
Yeah, and on up to the roof.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.113
Skye managed to extract some files
from the building's mainframe.

35:06.187 --> 35:09.566
It's not much,
but could get us a fix on Centipede.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.775
Maybe.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.789
You can't save someone
from themselves, sir.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.835
You can if you get to them
early enough.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.924
You've got two choices.

35:34.007 --> 35:38.228
Take what's in this box,
or we put you in a slightly bigger one.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.646
You wanna give me a hint?

35:45.769 --> 35:46.816
What's it do?

35:47.395 --> 35:49.318
Whatever we tell it to do.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.365
I'd try to avoid any unlawful activity.

35:51.441 --> 35:54.820
And I think you'll find it hard
to use electronic devices for a while.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.989
--You can go now.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.326
Cool, but we're still in Hong Kong.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.455
Yep.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.878
- I live in Austin, Texas.
-I know.

36:04.412 --> 36:07.962
Oh, and Agent Kwan's family thanks you
for the anonymous donation.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.257
My office.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.188
So you planning to stay?

36:23.682 --> 36:25.480
If they let me.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.936
You've changed.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.604
Good.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.778
I mean, you're not who you used to be.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.411
And you're not who I thought you were.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.116
I hope you find what you're looking for.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.588
Make it a double.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.673
Is there any other kind?

37:00.552 --> 37:03.476
So I'm going to Coulson's office now.

37:04.431 --> 37:08.026
Figured you might wanna be there,
being my S.O. and all.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.775
I'm off the clock.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.452
Right. Okay then.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.676
I didn't want anything to...

37:37.756 --> 37:39.224
Stop lying.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.761
Since the moment
you stepped foot on this plane,

37:42.844 --> 37:43.970
you've been lying.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.147
To my face. To all of us.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.190
- No, I haven't...
-You're lying now.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.940
I stood up for you
to my team down there.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.442
And some of us started
to believe in you.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.115
- Risked our lives for you.
-I...

37:56.191 --> 37:57.283
Why are you here?

37:57.984 --> 38:00.783
You've been keeping something
from us this whole time,

38:00.862 --> 38:02.284
and it wasn't just a boyfriend.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.865
You have a secret, Skye,

38:03.948 --> 38:06.246
and one chance to come out with it.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.624
That's now. Or I'm done with you.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.388
What is this?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.978
It's everything I have.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.681
On us?

38:28.807 --> 38:29.979
On me.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.656
That's why I learned to crack systems,

38:36.731 --> 38:39.154
why I joined the Rising Tide.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.657
To find any details I could
about my parents.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.456
There's nothing.

38:50.870 --> 38:51.917
No records.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.757
There's no trace of them.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.845
My lifelong search has led
to a single document.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.014
Redacted.

39:03.383 --> 39:04.885
By S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.977
No matter what you do,
I'll never stop looking.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.434
You might not like what you find.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.563
It can't be worse
than what I've imagined.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.864
Maybe I can help.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.171
Well, you know
I'm not gonna do the talking.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.715
The doctor is dead.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.258
About time.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.964
She did find a solution
to our combustion problem.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.054
We believe
we'll soon have stable subjects.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.602
On to Stage Two.

40:29.677 --> 40:33.056
That mean my situation
is going to improve any?

40:33.139 --> 40:35.938
Well, other problems have surfaced.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.860
Resurfaced, I should say.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.689
The S.H.I.E.L.D. unit in Hong Kong.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.783
We've encountered them before.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.452
They took our subject off the map
in Los Angeles.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.950
Not much I can do about that in here.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.749
So that's not why I'm getting the visit.

40:52.951 --> 40:56.330
We would like you to touch base
with The Clairvoyant.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.626
See if any insights can be given.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.835
On Stage Three.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.303
The Clairvoyant
doesn't like to be touched.

41:07.882 --> 41:11.932
We all have to do things
that make us uncomfortable

41:12.011 --> 41:15.436
if we are ever to get
our toy soldiers off the shelf.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.854
You know that better than any of us.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.608
I like your dress.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.495
I know.
