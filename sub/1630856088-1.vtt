00:42.501 --> 00:43.502
Hey, buddy.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.547
I don't know if this will get to you.
I hope so.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.091
Actually, I don't,
because it'll probably mean I'm dead,

00:49.758 --> 00:51.635
which you may not feel
too busted up about.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.513
Sorry, I gotta keep this short.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.515
You may never forgive me
for what I took from you,

00:56.515 --> 00:59.643
and I can't go back in time and fix
all the mistakes that I made.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.771
But maybe I could leave something
for the future.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.272
A legacy.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.109
And you'll realize it was all worth it.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.871
Pull it over.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.914
Pull it over.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.749
Release.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.275
What are you doing?
Get back to work!

03:53.901 --> 03:55.027
Get back to work!

06:19.463 --> 06:20.672
We have to wait.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.846
<i>Welcome to Tokyo.</i>

06:27.846 --> 06:31.433
<i>Please be seated for decontamination.
Thank you.</i>

06:35.145 --> 06:38.106
It's all about giving us
the illusion of safety.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.778
Like spraying us for parasites
would help prevent another monster attack.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.710
What is the purpose
of your visit to Japan?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.464
My father died recently,
and I'm settling his affairs.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.259
So business, I guess. Family business.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.639
Place your fingers on the glass plates, please.

07:58.729 --> 07:59.938
Okay.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.152
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.883
Take me to this address, please.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.038
You certainly seem prepared here.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.500
The government is spending lots of money.
Missiles, drones.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.918
Are you in the trade?

09:03.627 --> 09:04.670
The trade?

09:04.670 --> 09:07.214
Monster prep. Big business now.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.802
People always find a way
to profit off someone else's tragedy.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.720
More profit than tragedy.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.683
- What do you mean?
- San Francisco was a hoax.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.518
They did it with CGI.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.815
Well, that's quite a revelation.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.943
There's more. I have a podcast.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.774
Hi, Mom.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.235
<i>Hey. You said you'd call when you landed.</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:12.779
- And I just landed.
- <i>Yeah, two hours ago.</i>

10:13.780 --> 10:15.949
- <i>Cate, I've been wa--</i>
- I had to get through immigrations

10:15.949 --> 10:19.077
- and customs, get a cab.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

10:19.912 --> 10:22.414
<i>Okay. So, what, you're there now?</i>

10:23.707 --> 10:24.708
I'm here.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.461
<i>And?</i>

10:27.461 --> 10:28.879
And what, Mom?

10:29.588 --> 10:32.549
You think he'll just be sitting here,
waiting for someone to bring him home?

10:33.050 --> 10:35.385
<i>So we should have gone with your plan?</i>

10:35.385 --> 10:38.639
<i>Sit here, staring at the walls,
never knowing what this means?</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:41.433
<i>Cate. Cate?</i>

10:41.975 --> 10:44.228
- I'll call you back.
- <i>Cate, do not hang up on--</i>

11:51.295 --> 11:52.296
Who are you?

11:52.588 --> 11:53.589
What are you doing here?

11:53.589 --> 11:55.215
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

11:55.674 --> 11:56.508
Stop!

11:56.508 --> 11:58.510
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Whose apartment is this?

11:58.677 --> 11:59.845
What is it?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.180
She was just standing there!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.348
I think she might be unstable.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.766
What are you doing?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.143
Why do you have these pictures?

12:06.143 --> 12:07.936
- They're family pictures.
- What?

12:07.936 --> 12:11.106
- How did you get in here?
- I have the keys.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.193
- Where did you get those?
- I found them in my father's desk,

12:14.193 --> 12:16.653
along with the lease
for this apartment in his name.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.323
I don't know who your father is,
but this is our apartment.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.160
This is my father.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.123
Kentaro...

12:31.001 --> 12:32.044
Who is she?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.721
- Mother--
- Do you want me to drive?

12:43.305 --> 12:47.267
You couldn't have gotten us a vehicle
that was at least somewhat vehicular?

12:47.267 --> 12:50.354
You said, "Blend in."
Would you have preferred an oxcart?

12:50.854 --> 12:51.813
Yeah, maybe.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.691
Feed it some hay.
It wouldn't complain half as much.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.322
Billy, it's the pedal on the left.

13:00.322 --> 13:04.493
Hey, what's the rule on commentary
from the back seats?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.372
- Other left.
- Back seat.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.502
- You sure this is the right road?
- Let me check.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.633
5,000 millirems.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.719
6,000.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.055
Well, we're on the right road.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.350
The hell with it.
Never planned on having kids anyway.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.103
Really? Never?

13:33.188 --> 13:35.941
There was a time when you were
at least entertaining the idea.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.861
Well, there was a time where
that idea was very entertaining.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.322
Please,

13:42.322 --> 13:45.534
don't make things awkward and tell us
it's 'cause you never met the right woman.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.829
I gotta give it to you guys,
you make it look easy.

13:48.829 --> 13:53.834
Raising a great kid, being able to keep
Monarch together. That's no small feat.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.587
What we've done, we've done together.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.257
Yeah.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.389
7,000 millirems and rising.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.226
All right. Showtime.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.043
End of the line.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.213
These should give us
some level of protection.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.674
I guess that depends on
what we need protection from.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.177
You afraid you're gonna run into a titan?

14:46.136 --> 14:49.181
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- The army gave me one job, swab.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.016
It's keeping you eggheads alive.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.894
All right? So just follow my lead
for a change, please.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.687
Sir, yes, sir.

14:56.647 --> 14:57.648
Okay.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.192
We come back, proving the network is real,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.654
and then our theory
is not just some insane fantasy.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.738
Yeah.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.741
This could make everything
we've sacrificed worth it.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.642
Get the gear.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.283
Billy, fall in.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.368
Yeah, I'm coming.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.311
Put down your weapon!

16:18.353 --> 16:20.355
Calm down. Calm down.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.481
Pla-- Kei!

16:23.525 --> 16:25.611
Kei, keep your mask on.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.279
This is a restricted area.

16:29.907 --> 16:30.908
Who are you?

16:34.661 --> 16:35.579
We are scientists.

16:36.747 --> 16:37.998
We only want to help.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.751
And if you eat those you will get sick.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.837
Your family could die.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.132
You mean "the contamination"?

16:48.425 --> 16:50.093
It is a fairy tale

16:50.385 --> 16:52.971
to scare away the curious.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.349
Why?

16:55.557 --> 16:56.850
What are people so curious about?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.023
The old folks say...

17:03.982 --> 17:06.108
the government burned a hole
through the earth,

17:06.108 --> 17:07.402
all the way to Hell.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.864
Do you believe that?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.785
See for yourselves.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.511
Must be getting close.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.721
Thank you, Billy.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.957
There a problem?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.794
Hey, will you stop doing that?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.381
The problem is there is no radiation.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.426
That's impossible.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.054
We detected it 1,000 miles down range.
We should be standing at ground zero.

18:16.847 --> 18:17.681
But we're not.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.563
The boy was right. It's a fairy tale.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.940
Okay.
So, are we taking these things off or not?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.692
- 'Cause it's hotter than hell in here.
- No.

18:28.692 --> 18:29.776
Yes.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.615
Great. So, now you're trying to die?

18:34.615 --> 18:36.283
Well, Doc says yeah, so...

18:36.283 --> 18:39.161
- Yeah, I'm a doctor too, you know?
- Of course. Yeah, I know.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.556
She doesn't even look like him.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.808
But...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.435
...she has his keys.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.395
But not his face.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.190
Prove it.

19:10.359 --> 19:13.570
Where's your proof? A bunch of pictures?

19:15.030 --> 19:16.281
I've got pictures.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.664
This is us camping at the Redwoods.

19:24.373 --> 19:27.960
He got poison oak and had these
horrible red blotches all over his arms.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.922
Drove him crazy. Ring any bells?

19:34.716 --> 19:36.677
This is our backyard.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.930
He built that playhouse
for me when I was five.

19:42.307 --> 19:45.185
One weekend he was actually home.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.897
Here's a good one.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.359
I bought them a sunset cruise
for their wedding anniversary.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.528
Thirty years.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.989
That's an accomplishment.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.660
- How long were you married to him?
- Don't talk to her like that.

20:02.828 --> 20:04.454
I'm not judging her.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.624
But aren't you even curious
who he was cheating on first?

20:07.624 --> 20:09.376
Your mother or mine?

20:14.173 --> 20:16.175
Wai-- What do you want?

20:17.676 --> 20:18.677
Kentaro...

20:18.677 --> 20:20.345
...what is going on?

20:22.222 --> 20:25.058
Can you tell us anything?

20:25.851 --> 20:28.187
We have been waiting,

20:29.313 --> 20:30.397
looking,

20:31.732 --> 20:36.653
but Hiroshi's gone.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.758
I'm sorry I barged in here.
Let's just forget this happened.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.218
Are you kidding me?

20:59.218 --> 21:01.678
Please, help me understand.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.560
I wish I could.

21:10.145 --> 21:13.148
Here, these are yours.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.873
I'm not reading anything.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.334
Every time there's a small spike,

21:32.334 --> 21:35.045
it fades away
like it's been absorbed by something.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.339
Yeah. Or eaten.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.803
What?
It's not like we haven't seen it before.

21:42.803 --> 21:46.181
These things think the "A"
in A-bomb stand for "appetizer."

21:47.474 --> 21:49.893
Come on, time for some science shit.

22:09.955 --> 22:10.956
There you go.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.634
All right. Last charge is set.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.261
I think we need more spacing.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.221
These are supposed
to be set at 50 meters apart.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.473
That was for the larger ones.
The 3.8 megajoules.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.976
- Well, that's what we brought.
- No, these are the 2.1's.

22:30.976 --> 22:34.229
If you want to measure greater depth,
we get maximum overlap at 30 meters.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.647
Only when we use the diamond grid.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.608
- This was a circular dispersal.
- Fire in the hole.

22:52.998 --> 22:55.709
Wait. Is that-- Wait.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.627
- Voids.
- What?

22:56.627 --> 22:58.629
Chambers. Deep in the bedrock.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.465
There's something down there.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.716
Those are off the charts.

23:04.009 --> 23:05.135
Hell yeah, they are.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.679
This is what we've been looking for.

23:09.014 --> 23:09.848
Yes.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.413
This is it.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.257
Hi, Mom.

23:43.257 --> 23:44.967
<i>Cate, why haven't you called back?</i>

23:45.884 --> 23:47.803
- <i>What happened?</i>
- There's nothing here for us.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.639
<i>What? Was someone there?</i>

23:52.432 --> 23:53.600
- <i>Cate?</i>
- Did you know?

23:54.852 --> 23:55.853
<i>Know what?</i>

23:58.021 --> 23:59.189
- <i>Cate?</i>
- I gotta go.

23:59.773 --> 24:02.943
<i>Cate, what did you find out?
Whose apartment is it?</i>

24:02.943 --> 24:03.944
It's his.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.363
Mom, are you there?

24:07.739 --> 24:09.074
Mom? Mom!

24:25.674 --> 24:27.134
- Get up.
- What's happening?

24:27.134 --> 24:29.469
- It's the early warning system.
- Warning for what?

24:29.970 --> 24:30.971
Godzilla.

25:09.259 --> 25:12.679
- It's probably just a drill.
- How long do we have to stay here?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.056
We have to wait for...

25:14.056 --> 25:15.849
"All clear."

25:16.683 --> 25:17.768
What if it's not a drill?

25:17.768 --> 25:21.021
I thought you're from San Francisco.
You'd know better than we would.

25:31.865 --> 25:34.076
She wants to know if he was with you.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.160
What?

25:35.786 --> 25:37.663
When it happened, was he with you?

25:41.041 --> 25:42.584
What difference does that make now?

25:42.584 --> 25:44.253
You don't think it would've
made a difference

25:44.253 --> 25:46.004
if he'd been here with us instead?

25:49.466 --> 25:50.676
No, he wasn't with me.

26:04.565 --> 26:06.817
No, no. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

26:09.653 --> 26:12.447
Everyone, it's gonna be okay.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.741
I'm gonna get you out of here.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.829
It's fine. Everyone, follow me. Follow me!

26:35.137 --> 26:36.930
Kids! Come on!

26:37.431 --> 26:39.516
I got you. It's okay. Come on.

26:41.935 --> 26:42.936
It's okay. Come on.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.319
No! No!

26:58.911 --> 27:00.287
No!

27:00.287 --> 27:03.582
I need to go! I need to go, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.543
We need to get out of here.
Let go. Let me out!

27:36.281 --> 27:37.282
I'm fine.

27:39.701 --> 27:40.702
I'm fine.

28:10.315 --> 28:11.733
Holy crap.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.861
Well,
there's definitely something down there.

28:13.861 --> 28:15.654
Some new form of M.U.T.O.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.781
They look embryonic.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.451
Like larvae. Almost like a nursery.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.536
Yeah.

28:23.412 --> 28:27.457
And if it's a nursery,
Mom can't be far away, right?

28:28.041 --> 28:29.793
We need to get a sample
of their genetic material.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.172
So, you wanna go down there?

28:34.923 --> 28:38.635
Well, yeah. I mean,
they appear to be dormant, right?

28:40.762 --> 28:41.680
Appears to be?

28:41.680 --> 28:44.391
We're talking about
a new goddamn species, Lee.

28:44.391 --> 28:48.729
And we can't afford to pass up
an opportunity to learn w-whatever we can.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.899
We can. We can
if it's gonna get our asses killed.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.066
Then why are we here?

28:55.944 --> 28:57.279
I just think that we should--

28:59.156 --> 29:01.116
I have a bad feeling about this, okay?

29:01.116 --> 29:03.243
Billy's right.
We're not going home empty-handed.

29:03.827 --> 29:04.912
What are you doing?

29:04.912 --> 29:07.956
- I know the sample particles.
- Kei, come back over the railing.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.458
- Come on.
- I'm the lightest.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.210
You boys can pull me up
if I get in trouble.

29:11.210 --> 29:14.046
Okay.
We are not just letting you go down there.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.172
No.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.965
You're not letting me?

29:18.342 --> 29:19.343
Billy.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.850
She's right. It's gotta be her.

29:26.850 --> 29:31.396
What are you doing? Billy, what are you--
Bil-- Hey! Hey, B-- Stop. Stop!

29:31.396 --> 29:32.356
Both of you stop.

29:34.024 --> 29:36.485
Tell me exactly

29:36.485 --> 29:39.571
how much time you need down there
to collect enough genetic material.

29:39.571 --> 29:41.448
Five minutes. Tops.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.493
Okay. We'll do it together.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.044
Be careful.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.949
See? All clear.

30:23.949 --> 30:25.534
<i>All clear.</i>

30:25.534 --> 30:30.330
<i>Emergency alert has been canceled.
Please resume regular life.</i>

30:40.215 --> 30:42.176
So, everything just goes back to normal?

30:43.010 --> 30:45.304
What should we do?
Run home and hide in the closet?

31:04.406 --> 31:07.659
She's asking if you'll come
have tea and talk about your life.

31:09.536 --> 31:13.540
That's very kind, and you can tell her
I'm saying whatever you want right now.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.543
But I can't imagine anything
I'd like to do less

31:16.543 --> 31:19.338
than have tea with the woman Dad
was cheating on my mom with.

31:19.963 --> 31:23.050
Yeah. Well, from our perspective,
your mother was the other woman.

31:23.050 --> 31:24.510
That's fair. I'm gonna go now.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.054
The other woman's gonna have
a lot of questions.

31:27.554 --> 31:28.889
Did you get the answers?

31:30.599 --> 31:32.768
You flew halfway around
the world looking for something.

31:34.561 --> 31:36.021
Or what these unlock.

31:36.605 --> 31:39.066
And all you found was Dad
was apparently a lying asshole.

31:40.442 --> 31:41.443
Is that enough for you?

31:41.443 --> 31:42.778
I guess that'll have to do.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.240
You think our father was so bad?

31:48.408 --> 31:49.618
I wanna show you something.

32:14.476 --> 32:15.769
Okay.

32:16.937 --> 32:17.938
Look around.

32:20.107 --> 32:22.818
Am I looking for anything in particular?

32:24.945 --> 32:28.323
Well, him.
He just wasn't who you say he was.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.117
Maybe you just didn't know him.

32:33.328 --> 32:34.830
You gotta give it to the guy.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.875
He had two families and still had time
to be obsessed with work.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.335
- It was important.
- Please.

32:41.086 --> 32:42.379
Do you even know what he did?

32:42.379 --> 32:46.341
- Software for satellites.
-"Software for satellites."

32:50.888 --> 32:52.973
Did you ever meet anyone he works with?

32:54.141 --> 32:56.643
Ever get invited
to take-your-kid-to-work day?

32:57.686 --> 32:58.770
What do you do anyway?

32:59.271 --> 33:01.648
Let me guess. Computer engineering?

33:01.648 --> 33:04.151
Something that would make
dear old Dad proud.

33:09.573 --> 33:10.574
Hey!

33:12.117 --> 33:13.076
What's in here?

33:14.077 --> 33:15.704
I didn't know it was there.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.334
What are you doing?

33:20.918 --> 33:22.711
- What's your birthday?
- Stop doing that.

33:23.253 --> 33:25.297
I thought you wanted to introduce me
to your dad.

33:25.297 --> 33:26.798
Show me something I didn't know about him.

33:26.798 --> 33:30.344
'Cause the only thing in this room
that isn't old news to me is this.

33:33.305 --> 33:34.348
July 7th.

33:38.602 --> 33:39.478
What about your mom?

33:39.978 --> 33:41.230
He wouldn't be that obvious.

33:41.939 --> 33:43.273
Afraid of what we'll find?

33:45.901 --> 33:47.069
August 17th.

33:50.531 --> 33:52.950
Keep that up.
You're gonna get me locked out.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.538
Seriously, stop. I'll never get it open.

34:01.708 --> 34:02.918
How did you do that?

34:04.378 --> 34:07.172
Your birth month, my day.
Your mother's month, my mom's day.

34:21.895 --> 34:23.355
It smells like fish.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.686
- I need to know what this is.
- It's some kind of old data storage.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.855
- It's private.
- I'll make you a deal.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.942
You help me,
and I'll get out of your life forever.

35:12.237 --> 35:13.447
I might know someone.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.034
Go away. I'm eating.

35:18.035 --> 35:19.077
Come on, May.

35:20.370 --> 35:22.206
Have you seen a format like this before?

35:22.915 --> 35:24.124
What do you think, '80s?

35:25.292 --> 35:26.793
No. It's, like, '70s.

35:26.793 --> 35:31.089
You know, I can't drop everything
when you need a favor. Life goes on.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.384
I can pay you.

35:36.345 --> 35:38.138
Not much, but make it worth your time.

35:40.557 --> 35:41.558
Pay me?

35:43.018 --> 35:44.019
You wanna pay me?

35:45.562 --> 35:47.064
Okay. Whatever.

35:50.609 --> 35:51.735
Wait here.

35:55.572 --> 35:56.573
May.

35:59.868 --> 36:00.911
May!

36:01.828 --> 36:02.829
What?

36:03.372 --> 36:05.207
We can keep this professional.

36:05.207 --> 36:07.209
Is that what this relationship is now?

36:08.085 --> 36:09.294
Transactional?

36:10.337 --> 36:12.464
Or was it always that,
and I just didn't see it?

36:12.464 --> 36:13.882
I told you I needed some time.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.884
Yeah. And I gave it to you.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.681
You don't get to ghost me for months
and then show up out of nowhere,

36:20.681 --> 36:22.391
treating me like tech support.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.227
I'm sorry.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.229
And why should I do shit for you?

36:28.355 --> 36:30.858
And her, really? Is that for real?

36:31.608 --> 36:32.609
I don't know.

36:35.153 --> 36:37.489
But my father had that old data
in his safe for a reason.

36:37.990 --> 36:41.326
If there's something on it that
can explain this, or prove she's lying--

36:41.326 --> 36:42.661
Everything all right?

36:45.330 --> 36:46.164
I paid.

36:52.212 --> 36:53.630
You live around here?

36:54.381 --> 36:57.885
Yeah. It's cheap.
I mean, by Tokyo standards.

36:58.427 --> 37:02.097
Everyone minds their business.
It's real. I like it.

37:03.265 --> 37:06.101
But I wanna know more about this
'cause I have siblings.

37:06.101 --> 37:10.564
You know, we dribble out every few years.
We get a nine month heads-up.

37:10.564 --> 37:14.276
You just had one dropped
on you full-grown. This one, at that.

37:14.276 --> 37:15.903
Great, thanks.

37:15.903 --> 37:18.947
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, he's a delight.

37:21.074 --> 37:22.075
I like you.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.497
All right. Make yourselves at home.

37:28.916 --> 37:30.667
You know where everything is.

37:30.667 --> 37:31.752
Are you a collector?

37:33.712 --> 37:37.716
No. The audiophile nerds swear
it's the only way to listen to vinyl.

37:38.884 --> 37:42.054
They say it's warmer, more honest.

37:42.054 --> 37:47.100
They'll drop two, 300,000 yen on some
antique I pulled from grandpa's garage.

37:47.809 --> 37:49.228
Smack a fresh coat of wax on it.

37:49.228 --> 37:52.231
There's not even science
that says the sound is better.

37:52.231 --> 37:54.191
- It is.
- No, it's not.

37:54.191 --> 37:58.612
But hey, people wanna listen
with their hearts instead of their ears.

37:58.612 --> 38:00.614
I will gladly take their money.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.952
May is not what you call sentimental.

38:04.952 --> 38:08.121
Right. Because you know me so well.

38:09.206 --> 38:13.126
It keeps me in ramen and Asahi
during the dry spells.

38:14.086 --> 38:17.881
I mostly do
freelance coding and game design.

38:18.632 --> 38:20.425
Is this from one of your games?

38:21.009 --> 38:24.137
No. Actually, your brother did that.

38:24.137 --> 38:26.515
Half-brother.
And that's still up for debate.

38:26.515 --> 38:28.100
You said you were an engineer.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.686
No, you said that.

38:31.353 --> 38:33.564
All right. Here we go.

38:40.988 --> 38:41.989
Corrupted?

38:42.573 --> 38:43.490
Encrypted.

38:43.991 --> 38:45.075
So, you can't read it?

38:45.951 --> 38:48.537
Well,
encryption technology has come a long way.

38:49.663 --> 38:53.542
What was military grade 40 years ago,
is off-the-shelf now.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.278
Hey, it's Collins in data culling.

39:21.778 --> 39:24.615
I've got something here you should see.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.340
Yeah?

39:43.800 --> 39:45.010
What is it?

39:47.262 --> 39:50.807
Someone tried to run it through
some online decryption software.

39:50.807 --> 39:53.852
It's got a Monarch recognition code
embedded so it pinged back to us.

39:54.603 --> 39:55.771
How much did you get?

39:55.771 --> 39:57.814
Not much. Just a few megabytes.

39:59.441 --> 40:01.902
Well, whoever has it is being careful.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.779
They ran a small sample through
the decrypt,

40:03.779 --> 40:05.989
then immediately took it down
when they saw the software worked.

40:05.989 --> 40:09.034
- Did you get an IP address?
- Just a general area. Tokyo.

40:11.828 --> 40:13.830
So, do you want me to kick this up
to Verdugo?

40:15.624 --> 40:17.709
You know, I'll take care of it.

40:18.502 --> 40:21.839
Are you sure? 'Cause after G-Day, Verdugo
said she wanted to see everything--

40:21.839 --> 40:26.260
Thank you for everything. You were really
helpful. You did a great, great job.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.441
Hey. How's your Japanese?

40:51.952 --> 40:52.953
What is this?

40:54.621 --> 40:56.415
I don't know. But there is a lot of it.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.251
Is that Bigfoot?

41:00.335 --> 41:04.089
Wait-- Go back. What's that?

41:04.089 --> 41:06.466
It looks like that big satellite map
in his office.

41:10.554 --> 41:12.306
Yeah, but what is it a map of?

41:13.307 --> 41:14.766
I don't recognize anything.

41:16.226 --> 41:17.603
What's "Monarch"?

41:19.521 --> 41:20.731
They were there.

41:21.899 --> 41:23.275
In San Francisco.

41:24.276 --> 41:28.447
Like soldiers or something.
With this on their uniforms.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.326
Doing what?

41:33.452 --> 41:37.497
I don't know. It felt like the whole city
was coming down.

41:37.497 --> 41:41.376
People were trapped, dying,
and these guys were taking pictures.

41:42.211 --> 41:45.422
Running around like kids on a field trip.
Like they'd been waiting for it.

41:46.381 --> 41:48.509
You think that your father
was working for them?

41:49.718 --> 41:51.094
This stuff was in his safe.

41:52.221 --> 41:53.722
That's not who he was.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.312
Why are we even talking to her?

42:01.188 --> 42:03.732
If my father had been here with me
instead of San Francisco,

42:03.732 --> 42:05.150
he'd still be alive.

42:05.150 --> 42:07.736
But he wasn't in San Francisco on G-Day.

42:08.779 --> 42:11.448
I thought you couldn't speak Japanese?

42:12.866 --> 42:14.826
I never said that.

42:16.328 --> 42:18.872
It was my dad's and my secret language.

42:20.832 --> 42:22.584
I don't speak it anymore.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.421
You expect us to trust you now?

42:27.089 --> 42:28.173
After you tricked us?

42:30.384 --> 42:32.177
I wasn't trying to trick anyone.

42:42.229 --> 42:43.355
What do you mean?

42:43.355 --> 42:45.566
He wasn't there?

43:04.960 --> 43:06.461
- Dad?
- <i>Cate, where are you?</i>

43:06.461 --> 43:09.756
Dad. Oh, my God. Are you all right?
We've been calling and calling.

43:09.756 --> 43:12.426
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're at a camp.

43:13.343 --> 43:16.054
<i>Where exactly?
Where are you standing right now?</i>

43:16.054 --> 43:18.390
I'm at the Red Cross tent
near the north entrance.

43:20.350 --> 43:21.476
Dad?

43:22.394 --> 43:23.645
- Dad, are you there?
- Cate!

43:25.272 --> 43:26.940
Dad. Dad!

43:29.234 --> 43:30.402
Are you all right?

43:30.402 --> 43:31.820
I've been trying to call you for days.

43:31.820 --> 43:33.363
The cell network just came back up.

43:33.363 --> 43:34.364
Where have you been?

43:35.115 --> 43:36.909
I couldn't get a flight.
Everything was grounded.

43:36.909 --> 43:37.910
Is your mother okay?

43:38.911 --> 43:41.246
Come on. We've got a tent
on the other side of the camp.

43:41.246 --> 43:42.414
I can't stay.

43:43.957 --> 43:47.169
There's a bus heading east
out of the zone at 10pm tonight.

43:47.669 --> 43:50.380
There are passes in there
for you and your mom.

43:51.798 --> 43:52.799
When you get to Reno,

43:52.799 --> 43:54.760
there's a hotel and a car
reserved in your name.

43:56.220 --> 43:57.346
Reno?

43:57.346 --> 43:58.430
What...?

43:58.847 --> 44:01.767
You have to come now.
Mom's been sick worrying about you.

44:01.767 --> 44:03.727
I need you to take care of your mother.

44:08.565 --> 44:09.441
No.

44:09.441 --> 44:11.026
There's something I have to do.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.110
No!

44:14.696 --> 44:15.989
I'm sorry, Cate.

44:17.157 --> 44:18.200
But you are strong.

44:19.326 --> 44:20.869
You'll be all right.

44:24.665 --> 44:25.666
I'm sorry.

44:27.793 --> 44:28.794
"Sorry"?

44:31.463 --> 44:32.714
Tell your mom I love her.

44:34.758 --> 44:35.759
I love you both.

44:40.556 --> 44:41.557
Dad!

44:43.976 --> 44:44.935
Dad!

44:50.607 --> 44:54.778
About a week after that, we got a call
from the state police in Fairbanks, Alaska

44:54.778 --> 44:57.447
saying the bush plane he was on
disappeared in a storm.

44:59.032 --> 45:00.492
They never found the wreckage.

45:02.828 --> 45:04.162
What are y'all gonna do now?

45:06.582 --> 45:09.543
He wasn't perfect,
but he wasn't a monster.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.880
He had some reason for doing what he did.

45:15.966 --> 45:17.676
The answers have to be here.

45:19.261 --> 45:20.762
Good luck. I hope you find it.

45:21.555 --> 45:24.391
But nothing can justify what he did
to my mother and me.

45:28.437 --> 45:30.439
Stop. Go back.

45:32.649 --> 45:33.650
That?

45:37.362 --> 45:38.655
That's my grandmother.

45:39.615 --> 45:42.117
Yeah. She died when he was little.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.496
Why is her picture in these files?

45:49.875 --> 45:51.084
What is she standing in?

46:10.979 --> 46:11.980
All right.

46:17.319 --> 46:18.403
What do you see?

46:18.904 --> 46:21.240
Same as you, Billy. Just closer.

46:22.658 --> 46:23.575
Thank you.

46:38.298 --> 46:40.509
You're already under three minutes,
so get to work.

46:42.094 --> 46:44.805
There seems to be
multiple sets of appendages.

46:46.473 --> 46:47.850
Definitely insectoid.

46:49.059 --> 46:50.060
It's stunning.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.481
When they powered up the reactor,

46:54.481 --> 46:57.067
it must have drawn them toward
the surface to feed.

47:00.654 --> 47:02.072
Holy shit!

47:02.072 --> 47:04.324
Oh, my God. We gotta go.

47:05.701 --> 47:08.495
Kei. Forget the timeline. We gotta go.

47:08.495 --> 47:10.497
- One more minute. Okay.
- No, we gotta go now.

47:10.497 --> 47:11.874
Get up there!

47:12.541 --> 47:15.085
- You guys, run!
- Hey, look out!

47:15.085 --> 47:17.504
Get out of there, guys!
Come on, get back here!

47:19.423 --> 47:20.632
Come on!

47:25.220 --> 47:26.430
Oh, my God.

47:27.973 --> 47:30.517
Oh, my God. Go, go!

47:35.063 --> 47:36.648
Go! Go! Keep going!

47:38.942 --> 47:39.776
Pull!

47:41.236 --> 47:42.237
Pull!

47:49.620 --> 47:53.332
- Pull! Pull!
- They're coming! Hurry!

47:56.418 --> 47:58.045
Billy! Pull!

47:58.629 --> 47:59.630
No!

48:01.298 --> 48:02.508
No, don't drop me!

48:03.258 --> 48:04.343
No!

48:04.343 --> 48:05.802
There's too many!

48:09.765 --> 48:11.266
- We're too heavy.
- No!

48:11.266 --> 48:12.726
Give me your hand!

48:13.644 --> 48:15.854
- I can't hold on!
- Reach, Kei!

48:16.897 --> 48:17.898
Reach!

48:17.898 --> 48:21.693
- I can't hold on!
- Pull! Pull!

48:23.320 --> 48:24.613
No!
