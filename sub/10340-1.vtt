WEBVTT

03:16.279 --> 03:18.614
Gone fishing.

03:43.097 --> 03:48.268
The lonesome foghorn blows.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.531
Oh, dear.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.701
Lucy?

04:45.868 --> 04:50.831
Lucy, this is Pete Martell.
Lucy, put Harry on the horn.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.041
Sheriff,
it's Pete Martell up at the mill.

04:53.668 --> 04:57.713
Um, I'm gonna transfer it to the phone
on the table by the red chair.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.382
The red chair against the wall.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.510
The little table with the lamp on it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.887
The lamp that we moved
from the corner.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.350
The black phone,
not the brown phone.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.564
Morning, Pete. Harry.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.775
She's dead.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.902
Wrapped in plastic.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.323
Whoa, hold on.
Hold on a second, Pete.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.034
Where?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.912
You stay right there. I'm on my way.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.878
You better get Dr. Hayward.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.713
Tell him to meet me up
at the Packard Mill,

05:39.881 --> 05:41.131
the dock right below the dam.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.634
And roust that Andy out of bed,
tell him to get his butt up there now.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.846
- What is it?
- We got a body up there.

05:48.014 --> 05:53.310
Lucy, not a word about this to anyone
until you hear from me.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.625
It's over here.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.929
You want forensics first?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.473
No, she's been in the water.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.476
We'd better take some pictures.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.440
- Who is she?
- Andy, pictures.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.192
- Sorry.
- Then we'll turn her over.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.903
Sure, okay.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.172
Oh, Andy.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.508
My God, Andy.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.052
Same thing as last year
in Mr. Blodgett's barn.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.639
- Give me the camera, Andy.
- Sorry.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.683
Is this gonna happen
every damn time?

07:14.851 --> 07:17.394
I'm sorry.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.062
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.148
Why don't you go up
to the coroner's van

07:21.315 --> 07:23.275
and bring back that stretcher?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.776
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.154
Sorry.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.034
Harry, let's roll her over.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.600
Good Lord. Laura.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.438
Laura Palmer.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.400
Laura.

08:07.570 --> 08:12.073
Laura, sweetheart,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.579
Yes, I am.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.081
Laura.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.384
Laura?

08:32.220 --> 08:34.262
Oh, for goodness sakes.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.271
Laura, now means now.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.066
Laura?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.612
Laura?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.911
Laura, honey, are you downstairs?

09:30.486 --> 09:32.654
- Hello?
- Bett, it's Sarah.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.574
Listen, I just went up to wake Laura
and she's not here.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.159
- Is she with Bobby?
- Well, she could be.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.496
He leaves every morning to go running
and then he goes to football practice.

09:41.872 --> 09:46.042
Can you, um, find out?
Can you reach him? I'll call the school.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.837
Just a minute, I've got
the number of the field office here.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.715
Thanks. Thanks, Bett.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.719
You know, I'm wondering
if maybe she went out with Leland.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.012
He had an early meeting.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.349
Oh, I'm sure that's it.
Either that or she's with Bobby.

10:01.517 --> 10:05.854
Sure. I'll call up to the hotel, thanks.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.443
Hmm.

10:12.528 --> 10:16.698
No, Bobby hasn't showed up
for practice yet today.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.950
And come to think of it,
as a matter of fact,

10:19.118 --> 10:21.494
he's been late every day this week,
Mrs. Palmer.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.704
And last week.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.874
And maybe even the week before.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.374
- Are they ready to sign?
- You're not gonna mention

11:07.541 --> 11:10.043
that we have not as yet acquired
access to the Packard land?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.091
Sorry.

11:18.469 --> 11:22.263
We have solid information

11:22.431 --> 11:26.518
that the Packard Sawmill
is gonna go belly-up within a year.

11:26.686 --> 11:32.315
We're gonna be able to get it
for a song. One verse, no chorus.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.984
Now,

11:35.152 --> 11:36.695
let's get out there

11:36.862 --> 11:41.199
and get those cheese-eaters
where they live.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.035
Ahh, Benjamin...

11:46.497 --> 11:49.708
Clean, wholesome environment,
much like your very own.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.421
With a quality of life

11:54.588 --> 11:59.008
to rival the very best
that this country has to offer.

11:59.176 --> 12:06.182
And that is what the Ghostwood
Country Club and Estates will be.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.895
Now, when I first spoke to Sven,

12:11.063 --> 12:17.902
he was naturally very concerned
about the quality of air here.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.321
If you'll permit me, Sven,

12:20.489 --> 12:24.033
to repeat what you told me
this morning after your run:

12:24.201 --> 12:29.664
"My air sacs, ah,
have never felt so good."

12:34.211 --> 12:38.548
Your wife's on the phone again.
She said it's urgent.

12:41.510 --> 12:45.430
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.933
Uh, make it snappy, huh?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.352
So...

12:52.271 --> 12:54.147
...here in Twin Peaks,

12:54.315 --> 12:59.360
health and industry
go hand in hand.

13:00.696 --> 13:04.532
- I'll transfer you to the house phone.
- Okay, thank you.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.540
Ahh. Sarah, what is it?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.667
- Is Laura with you?
- No, why?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.503
She didn't go with you this morning?

13:16.670 --> 13:19.756
No, what...? Honey, what's wrong?
What's this all about?

13:19.924 --> 13:21.716
She's not here.
She wasn't here this morning.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.303
Well, she's, um,
probably with Bobby.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.013
I can't find Bobby.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.307
Well, there you are. That's it.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.977
Let's not worry.
I mean, they're probably together.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.979
She would've left a note.
Why didn't she?

13:35.147 --> 13:38.233
- She would've told me.
- Honey, honey, take it easy, please.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.069
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Leland Palmer.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.072
He's right over there on the phone.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.990
Sheriff Truman.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.662
What? Who? What did you say?

13:53.916 --> 13:56.918
Oh, my God.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.256
Oh, God. Laura.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.590
No.

14:02.758 --> 14:06.886
Laura. Oh, Leland, please, what is it?
Tell me.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.264
Leland...

14:09.431 --> 14:11.850
Is this about Laura?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.309
I'm afraid it is.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.272
Leland?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.691
Tell me.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.443
Oh. My baby.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.616
No! Oh, no!

14:28.784 --> 14:32.287
- No.
- Okay?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.039
Leland, we're ready to go
with the contracts.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.254
Leland?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.965
What's wrong?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.385
My daughter's dead.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.419
No!

15:47.863 --> 15:50.490
What kept you, Heidi?
Seconds on knockwurst this morning?

15:50.658 --> 15:53.076
I couldn't get my car started.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.078
Too busy jump-starting
the old man, huh?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.082
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.092
I thought the only time you cared
about, Bobby, was making time.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.844
You heading out, Shelly?

16:12.513 --> 16:13.721
Yeah, I'm heading home.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.058
I'm going to practice. I can drop you
by your place on the way if you want.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.188
That would be great, thanks.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.531
Here's a tune for you, gals.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.450
Okay.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.995
Norma.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.956
I'll see you in my dreams.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.084
Not if I see you first.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.005
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.021
I think she knows about us.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.189
- Norma?
- Mm-hm.

17:05.733 --> 17:10.445
No. Fat chance.
I think she's hot to trot for you herself.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.101
It's happy hour in France.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.687
Come on, cowboy, light your fire.

17:44.855 --> 17:49.192
Right. Just a little pick-me-up
before home room?

17:53.989 --> 17:57.033
- I thought I was your little pick-me-up.
- Ha, ha.

17:57.201 --> 18:02.455
Baby, you are more like
a three-stage rocket.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.708
A pocket rocket.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.920
And what stage are we in now?

18:10.214 --> 18:14.175
Are you sure that your old man
is still on the road?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.719
Yes, he called me last night
from Butte.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.389
That's a long ways away
and he ain't got a phone in his truck.

18:20.557 --> 18:25.144
So quit worrying
and start scurrying, Mr. Touchdown.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.150
Butte.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.944
Back up.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.785
I'll call you later.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.763
Leland, I'm so sorry.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.516
Seventeen years old.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.315
Lee, I hate to put you through this.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.694
No, I have to see her.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.156
I have to see
what was done to my little girl.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.201
Okay.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.854
My baby.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.981
It's my little girl.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.527
- God, God.
- Let's get out of here.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.737
I can't...

20:00.657 --> 20:02.909
Oh, God.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.373
- Have you seen Laura?
- No, not yet.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.961
- Nice day for a picnic.
- Uh, yeah.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.603
Bobby Briggs,
they're looking for you.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.689
- Who is?
- Sheriff is.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.817
Well, here I am in school.

21:22.322 --> 21:27.576
- Hey, Snake.
- Hey, man, something's up.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.288
- Where?
- Think I'm kidding?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.914
What, me worry?

21:32.082 --> 21:35.167
Bobby, you're wanted in the office.

21:35.335 --> 21:39.839
- Who wants me in the office?
- Right now, young man.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.800
Watch out.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.984
- Terry Franklin?
- Here.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.652
- Martha Grimes?
- Here.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.030
- Donna Hayward?
- Here.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.949
- Audrey Horne?
- Here.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.951
- James Hurley?
- Yo.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.205
Excuse me. Room 106?

22:13.790 --> 22:14.832
Mm-hm.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.710
Is there a Bobby Briggs
in this classroom?

22:17.878 --> 22:21.255
No, um, he's in 107? 107.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.299
Could I speak to you
for a moment, please?

22:23.467 --> 22:25.134
Certainly.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.178
- Um, there's a...
- Mm-hm.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.602
The principal will be making
an announcement.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.687
Yes?

22:38.357 --> 22:39.607
Thank you for your time.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.126
Laura.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.387
There will be an announcement
from the principal.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.532
I told you, I got up early
like I always do.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.951
I went running like I always do.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.786
I went for some breakfast
at the Double R

23:33.954 --> 23:37.206
and I didn't go to practice
because I didn't feel like it.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.543
Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby?
Were you upset about something?

23:40.710 --> 23:43.838
Something troubling you,
Bobby? You wanna tell us about it?

23:44.005 --> 23:48.134
Look, you guys, please, what did I do?
What's going on?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.761
Mr. Wolchezk,
there's rumors all over school.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.722
Maybe it's best
if they heard it from you.

23:53.890 --> 23:57.309
Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you go ahead
and make that announcement?

23:57.477 --> 24:00.688
- Now?
- Now's the time.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.566
Excuse me.

24:03.733 --> 24:07.403
What is it, sheriff? What's going on?

24:09.656 --> 24:12.950
Now, Bobby, you look at me.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.829
Your girlfriend,
Laura Palmer's, been killed.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.082
She was found just after dawn.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.585
Now, she was with you last night

24:22.752 --> 24:27.089
and you weren't where you
were supposed to be this morning.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.426
Have these fellas advised you
of your rights?

24:31.303 --> 24:35.181
Yes, but I didn't know why.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.100
- Laura's dead?
- Yes.

24:38.268 --> 24:42.771
Did you understand your rights
as they were explained to you?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.817
You think I killed her?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.486
We're gonna have you
make a phone call.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.697
You can call your parents and they can
arrange to get a lawyer to be with you

24:51.865 --> 24:54.783
when we talk to you again.

24:54.951 --> 24:59.121
Andy, take Bobby out
to make his call.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.171
I loved her.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.175
And she loved me.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.345
You think because I wasn't at football
practice that I killed my girlfriend?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.096
You are crazy.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.641
You get off of me.

25:18.808 --> 25:23.354
Bobby, we're gonna talk
about this later.

25:24.814 --> 25:29.485
May I have your attention, please?
This is Principal Wolchezk.

25:30.111 --> 25:34.740
I am deeply saddened
to have to tell you

25:34.908 --> 25:40.371
that early this morning your classmate
Laura Palmer was found dead.

25:41.998 --> 25:45.626
This is a terrible moment
for all of us.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.380
For all of us who knew her.

25:49.548 --> 25:54.260
Her friends, her family.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.932
It is very important that we all try
to help each other

26:00.100 --> 26:02.351
through this difficult time.

26:05.355 --> 26:11.610
The police have asked me
to ask each of you,

26:11.778 --> 26:16.198
if you have any information
about Laura's activities

26:16.366 --> 26:19.451
after school yesterday

26:19.619 --> 26:22.204
or yesterday evening,

26:22.372 --> 26:24.999
please come forward.

26:26.668 --> 26:31.005
I am dismissing all classes
for the day,

26:31.172 --> 26:33.841
but before we leave,

26:34.009 --> 26:37.094
I would like to ask each of you

26:37.262 --> 26:41.849
to join me in a moment of silence

26:42.142 --> 26:44.560
for Laura

26:45.228 --> 26:48.147
and her dear memory.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.776
Oh, God.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.350
You can talk to her now, Harry.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.145
Do you know what time it was

28:10.313 --> 28:13.691
when you last saw Laura,
Mrs. Palmer?

28:15.610 --> 28:17.695
- What time?
- Yes.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.282
Uh, it would have been about 9.

28:23.076 --> 28:27.496
Yes, 9:00...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.166
...p.m.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.795
She came home from Bobby's

28:36.798 --> 28:40.551
and she was going up the stairs.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.723
Those stairs right there.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.188
Who's upstairs?

28:53.356 --> 28:56.191
Your husband and one of my men.

29:02.157 --> 29:06.869
I can tell from the sounds
that it isn't her.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.429
Her diary?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.852
Do you know where the key
to this is, sir?

29:34.314 --> 29:38.984
- Do you have to take that?
- We'll return it as soon as possible.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.295
Did she say anything to you?

30:01.466 --> 30:04.009
No.

30:04.969 --> 30:08.430
She said good night.

30:09.849 --> 30:14.311
And I said good...

30:16.940 --> 30:22.611
Good night, sweetheart.

30:33.998 --> 30:37.459
Mrs. Palmer, can you remember,

30:37.627 --> 30:41.880
did she make or receive
any phone calls?

30:44.133 --> 30:49.346
I heard her phone ring once.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.390
About what time was that?

30:52.392 --> 30:55.644
I don't know who it was.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.860
Harry.

31:06.739 --> 31:07.781
That was Lucy.

31:07.949 --> 31:11.618
Got a call from a guy that works up
at the mill, Janek Pulaski.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.705
Says his daughter didn't come home
last night.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.625
And she didn't show up
at school today either.

31:33.308 --> 31:43.442
Two by fours, four by eights.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.904
Two by fours, four by...

31:47.071 --> 31:49.740
Did you hear me?
You can't do that to my workers.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.076
Don't walk away from me like that.
Come on back here.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.328
You're not going anywhere

31:54.495 --> 31:57.831
and you're not gonna tell
anybody anything.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.417
Katherine,

32:00.585 --> 32:04.004
I'm sorry if this offends you,
but I am the owner of this sawmill.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.381
And you don't know the first thing
about this mill.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.717
That's why I'm running it.

32:08.885 --> 32:12.804
I've never taken this authority before,
but maybe I should have.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.598
You're not shutting us down.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.810
Katherine, I have the final say-so.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.356
Peter, push the plug.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.149
Pete, don't you dare.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.823
Katherine, please.

32:34.077 --> 32:39.957
Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.376
That's right.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.515
May I have your attention?
This is Josie Packard.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.894
I've decided that today,
in the light of what has happened,

33:01.062 --> 33:02.646
all work here will stop.

33:02.814 --> 33:03.855
Bitch.

33:04.023 --> 33:09.152
This morning, as you know,
the body of Miss Laura Palmer...

33:09.320 --> 33:10.362
What's your name?

33:10.530 --> 33:12.489
- was found near our dock.
- Fred Truax.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.783
You're fired.

33:15.410 --> 33:20.622
Just now your coworker and a friend,
Mr. Janek Pulaski,

33:20.790 --> 33:24.501
has learned that his daughter,

33:24.669 --> 33:29.172
one of Laura's schoolmates,
is missing since last night.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.301
Today, all work here will stop.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.303
The mill will shut down.

33:38.182 --> 33:42.477
Perhaps you can
spend the day with your families.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.313
Thank you all for your attention.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.304
What the hell?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.219
Laura's dead.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.515
Yeah, I heard.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.104
She was the one.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.608
Buy you a coffee?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.278
Can't do it.

35:19.075 --> 35:22.119
If you see Donna,
could you give this to her?

35:22.286 --> 35:24.204
You bet.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.626
Ed.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.547
Ed.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.009
They said those drapes
would be ready by 10.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.972
Now, I want those drapes up
by nightfall.

36:04.787 --> 36:10.417
Diane, 11:30 a.m., February 24th.
Entering the town of Twin Peaks.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.335
It's five miles south
of the Canadian border,

36:12.503 --> 36:15.338
twelve miles west of the state line.

36:15.506 --> 36:19.176
I've never seen so many trees
in my life.

36:19.343 --> 36:23.096
As W.C. Fields would say,
"I'd rather be here than Philadelphia."

36:23.264 --> 36:26.016
Fifty-four degrees
on a slightly overcast day.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.101
Weatherman said rain.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.479
If you could get paid that kind of money
for being wrong 60 percent of the time,

36:31.647 --> 36:33.899
it'd beat working.

36:34.066 --> 36:37.402
Mileage is 79,345,
gauge is on reserve.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.447
I'm riding on fumes here,
I gotta tank up when I get into town.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.283
Remind me to tell you
how much that is.

36:43.451 --> 36:48.413
Lunch was, uh, $6.31
at the Lamplighter Inn.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.708
That's on Highway 2
near Lewis Fork.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.044
That was a tuna fish sandwich
on whole wheat,

36:54.212 --> 36:56.171
slice of cherry pie
and a cup of coffee.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.881
Damn good food.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.384
Diane, if you ever get up this way,
that cherry pie is worth a stop.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.511
Okay.

37:03.679 --> 37:07.140
Looks like I'll be
meeting up with a, uh...

37:07.308 --> 37:09.601
...Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.269
Shouldn't be too hard
to remember that.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.563
He'll be
at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.732
Guess we're gonna go
and take a look at that girl

37:15.900 --> 37:18.401
that crawled down the railroad tracks
off the mountain.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.111
When finished,
I'll check into a motel.

37:20.279 --> 37:23.365
The sheriff will be able to recommend
a clean place and reasonably priced.

37:23.532 --> 37:26.826
That's what I need.
A clean place, reasonably priced.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.330
Oh. Diane, I almost forgot.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.582
I've got to find out
what kind of trees these are.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.043
They're really something.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.129
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.799
- Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
- Dale Cooper, FBI.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.468
- Pleasure. Ahem.
- Good to meet you.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.472
- Have any trouble finding the place?
- No, no. Your directions were fine.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.059
Came out over Highway 2,
near Lewis Fork.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.103
Stopped at a place
called the Lamplighter Inn.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.606
Had a slice of cherry pie. Incredible.

37:56.774 --> 38:00.318
Well, I'll tell you,
we're sure glad to have the FBI here.

38:00.486 --> 38:04.281
Kind of lucky, in a way, that Ronette
stepped out across the state line.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.991
Whole town's
really badly shaken up.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.034
Sure, nice, quiet place,
something like this.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.954
Sheriff, let me stop you
in the hallway here for just a second.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.498
There's a few things
we gotta get straight right off the bat.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.584
I've learned about this the hard way.
It's best to talk about it up front.

38:16.752 --> 38:19.963
When the Bureau gets called in,
the Bureau's in charge.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.631
Now, you're gonna be
working for me.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.591
Sometimes local law
has a problem with that.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.135
I hope you understand.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.930
Well, like I said,
we're glad to have you here.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.765
Sheriff,

38:30.933 --> 38:34.769
what kind of fantastic trees
have you got growing around here?

38:34.937 --> 38:38.315
- Big, majestic...
- Douglas firs.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.401
Douglas firs.

38:43.112 --> 38:46.740
Can someone get me a copy of
the coroner's report on the dead girl?

38:46.907 --> 38:49.117
Well, the autopsy
hasn't been done yet.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.161
But I'll take you downstairs
to the morgue

38:51.329 --> 38:52.579
when we're finished here.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.664
Oh, that will be fine.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.214
Dr. Shelvy,
this is FBI Agent Cooper.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.383
- Glad to know you.
- Doctor, how's the girl?

39:05.551 --> 39:08.053
She's in shock,
suffering from exposure.

39:08.220 --> 39:12.182
- Can I see her?
- All right, this way.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.491
Was she raped?

39:29.658 --> 39:30.700
Several times.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.162
- One perpetrator?
- We're waiting for the results.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.374
Is there any connection
to the dead girl?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.292
Same high school.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.295
Far as we know,
they hardly knew each other.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.131
- No connection.
- Mm.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.842
I'd like to question her.

39:49.345 --> 39:52.764
This girl doesn't even
know where she is. Or if she is.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.724
What exactly are you saying?

39:55.768 --> 39:59.020
We need a CAT scan
and we're not equipped for that here.

39:59.188 --> 40:02.565
My opinion,
she may have neurological damage.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.151
She's just not responsive at all.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.157
I'd like to examine her fingers.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.414
All right.

40:23.921 --> 40:28.716
- They've already scraped for particles.
- No, that's not what I'm looking for.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.472
Oh, no, there's nothing here.
Not a thing.

40:36.600 --> 40:42.021
Don't go there.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.440
Ronnie?

40:43.941 --> 40:45.900
Ronette?

41:02.001 --> 41:05.336
I catch this fish,
pull him out of the water, big mouth.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.798
It's got a big mouth
and starts talking to me. Wh...?

41:08.966 --> 41:10.049
Hey, hey.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.641
Harry?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.810
Dr. Jacoby.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.481
Terrible, terrible tragedy.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.733
Yes.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.115
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.826
- Gary Cooper?
- Agent Cooper.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.287
Agent. FBI.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.206
- Right.
- Heh.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.583
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.

41:43.751 --> 41:47.587
Laura was a patient of mine.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.256
You're on your way to the morgue
now, do you mind if I join you?

41:50.424 --> 41:53.176
Yes, I do. Why would you want to?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.470
It's sort of against procedure, doctor.

41:55.638 --> 41:59.641
Heh. Well, no offense.
I thought I could be of some help.

41:59.808 --> 42:02.519
You still could be. At another time.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.812
Oh. I understand completely.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.564
By the way,

42:07.691 --> 42:09.275
Laura's...

42:09.443 --> 42:11.819
Laura's parents...

42:12.821 --> 42:16.115
Well, they didn't know
that she was seeing me. Ha, ha.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.212
- That guy's a psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

42:33.759 --> 42:37.011
I have to apologize again
for the fluorescent lights.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.514
I think it's a bad transformer.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.016
That's quite all right.

42:43.269 --> 42:47.772
Agent Cooper, we did scrape
those nails when we brought her in.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.943
Here it is.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.612
- There it is. Oh, my God, here it is.
- What?

42:54.780 --> 42:57.198
- Would you leave us, please?
- Jim.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.783
Uh, would you
leave us alone, please?

42:58.951 --> 43:01.452
Oh! Certainly.

43:03.205 --> 43:05.456
I've got to find something
to grab onto this with.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.610
Diane, I'm at the Twin Peaks County
Morgue with the body of the victim...

43:33.777 --> 43:35.111
- What's her name?
- Laura Palmer.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.321
Laura Palmer.

43:36.488 --> 43:38.781
I got here before the autopsy.
Diane, it's the same thing.

43:38.949 --> 43:40.533
I had a feeling we'd see this again.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.785
What do you got there?

43:43.287 --> 43:46.539
Ring finger, under the nail.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.752
Let's see what he left us.

43:53.339 --> 43:54.380
It's an "R."

43:56.675 --> 44:00.345
Diane, give this to Albert and his team.
Don't go to Sam.

44:00.512 --> 44:02.055
Albert seems
a little more on the ball.

44:02.222 --> 44:06.017
- We need to bag and tag this.
- Okay, Cooper.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.728
You gonna let me in
on whatever the hell is going on here?

44:10.105 --> 44:12.857
Sheriff, we got a lot to talk about.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.053
Hi, Ed.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.389
Hey, Donna.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.899
I'm so sorry.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.363
- Have you seen James yet?
- He came by.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.074
- Is he okay?
- No.

45:03.242 --> 45:05.952
Do you know where he went?
I've already been to the Roadhouse.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.914
I don't know, honey.
He told me to give you this.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.509
What the hell are you doing?

45:21.677 --> 45:24.053
- Well, I came by...
- I've been looking all over for you.

45:24.221 --> 45:26.681
In case you didn't realize it,
Bobby's in a lot of trouble.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.850
He's my best friend.
You're supposed to be with me.

45:29.017 --> 45:30.518
We're going to the police station.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.520
Look, don't tell me
where I ought to be.

45:33.188 --> 45:36.107
Second of all,
Laura was my best friend.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.609
- Get in the car.
- Muffle it, junior.

45:38.777 --> 45:41.696
- Mind your own business.
- You're on my lot, friend.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.741
Oh, Ed, I'm not your friend.

45:46.326 --> 45:49.162
Donna, you get to the sheriff's
right now.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.921
Boy, I sure know
how to pick them, huh?

45:59.089 --> 46:02.550
Ed, you waiting for those drapes
to hang themselves?

46:02.718 --> 46:04.135
Yeah, okay.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.640
Well, I know how to pick them too.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.478
Will you do me a favor?

46:13.645 --> 46:15.730
If James comes around,
tell him I'm looking for him?

46:15.898 --> 46:18.107
You bet.

46:18.275 --> 46:20.860
And, Donna, you take it easy.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.321
Okay.

46:33.457 --> 46:36.626
That's the, uh, videotape we just saw.
The one we found in Laura's bedroom.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.211
Right.

46:38.378 --> 46:41.672
At a certain point, I'm gonna wanna
show this to the boyfriend.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.133
You say when.

46:44.301 --> 46:47.970
- Did you complete your forensics?
- You bet. All done.

46:48.472 --> 46:51.933
- No key yet, huh?
- We're still looking.

46:58.106 --> 46:59.148
Why not?

47:06.031 --> 47:08.699
Diane, I've just opened
Laura Palmer's diary.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.451
This is the, uh...

47:10.619 --> 47:14.205
It's the last entry,
dated February 23rd.

47:15.040 --> 47:20.878
It reads, "Asparagus for dinner again.
I hate asparagus.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.381
Does this mean I'll never grow up?"

47:24.007 --> 47:27.468
And then she's written,
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

47:27.636 --> 47:30.596
That's the letter J, Diane.

47:31.306 --> 47:33.349
J...

47:35.519 --> 47:38.187
And that is the last entry.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.730
That's something to get started on.

47:39.898 --> 47:42.400
Yeah, that's one out of 26.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.151
Yeah, one out of 26.

47:46.405 --> 47:49.198
Diane, I've just turned back 18 days
to day one.

47:49.366 --> 47:52.535
What we have taped to the page here
is a plastic envelope

47:52.703 --> 47:54.912
containing a white residue
and what looks to be a key

47:55.080 --> 47:56.789
to a safety deposit box.

47:57.457 --> 48:02.295
Sheriff, after you very carefully
remove this key,

48:02.462 --> 48:04.964
we're gonna run this envelope.

48:05.132 --> 48:09.927
And my bet is
it'll test positive for cocaine.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.263
That's impossible.

48:13.515 --> 48:14.974
You ever been surprised before?

48:15.893 --> 48:20.104
Mr. Cooper,
you didn't know Laura Palmer.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.482
Let's get started on a court order
to open that safety deposit box,

48:23.650 --> 48:26.110
and maybe we'll both find out
a few things about Laura Palmer.

48:34.828 --> 48:38.164
Diane, I'm holding in my hand
a small box of chocolate bunnies.

48:46.632 --> 48:47.673
Lucy.

48:48.175 --> 48:49.884
Andy, is that you?

48:50.052 --> 48:54.472
Tell Harry we found
where... it happened.

48:55.641 --> 49:00.311
Where Ronette
and Laura were taken and tortured.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.647
Tell Harry...

49:05.817 --> 49:08.486
...I didn't cry.

49:09.237 --> 49:12.740
Andy, are you okay?

49:13.283 --> 49:14.367
Sweetie?

49:15.202 --> 49:17.536
But, Lucy,

49:19.498 --> 49:22.667
it's horrible.

49:23.835 --> 49:25.836
Andy.

49:26.004 --> 49:27.546
Sweetie.

49:28.757 --> 49:31.634
Oh, God.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.896
This is to reaffirm
that you have been advised

49:44.064 --> 49:46.816
of your constitutional rights,
am I correct?

49:46.984 --> 49:48.234
Yes.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.570
Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?

49:51.989 --> 49:53.030
No.

49:53.949 --> 49:56.617
She was studying at your house
until about 9:30 last night,

49:56.785 --> 49:58.202
isn't that right?

49:58.370 --> 49:59.537
Yeah.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.580
Bobby.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.541
Yes, sir.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.960
Did she drive herself home?

50:06.712 --> 50:08.129
Yes.

50:09.006 --> 50:11.799
You two had a big fight last week,
didn't you?

50:11.967 --> 50:13.843
So what?

50:14.011 --> 50:16.429
If I had a fight with her,
if I sang songs with her,

50:16.596 --> 50:19.557
if I went skipping rope with her,
what difference does it make?

50:19.725 --> 50:21.642
I didn't kill her.

50:26.815 --> 50:30.109
Bobby, here's how this works.

50:30.277 --> 50:34.488
We ask the questions, and you answer
the questions that we ask.

50:34.656 --> 50:36.449
Briefly and to the point.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.512
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

51:01.433 --> 51:02.475
No.

51:03.935 --> 51:07.021
Well, if you didn't, then who did?

51:07.647 --> 51:10.274
Did you know Laura
was seeing someone else?

51:11.276 --> 51:12.943
That's what you two fought about
last week.

51:16.364 --> 51:17.698
Look at these pictures.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.619
Look how happy she is.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.625
You ever do cocaine with Laura,
Bobby?

51:29.503 --> 51:31.170
I don't do drugs.

51:31.338 --> 51:34.715
Excuse me, but what are you charging
my client with?

51:39.221 --> 51:41.514
That's right.

51:43.141 --> 51:46.143
You're a football player,
aren't you, Bobby?

51:50.148 --> 51:52.441
Bobby, if you knew
who she was seeing,

51:52.609 --> 51:55.528
trust us on this,
now's the time to tell us.

51:55.695 --> 51:56.737
Why don't you ask Donna?

51:56.905 --> 52:00.324
- She was there with her.
- Because I'm asking you.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.160
Come on, Bobby. Give me a name.

52:05.163 --> 52:08.082
Here's a hint. First initial, J.

52:11.336 --> 52:13.170
J.

52:23.348 --> 52:25.266
No.

52:27.185 --> 52:29.687
She wouldn't do that to me.

52:32.190 --> 52:33.566
You didn't love her, anyway.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.111
Let him go.

52:51.501 --> 52:55.337
Julie, the Norwegians are signing
the contract at 4:00

52:55.505 --> 52:57.089
when Mr. Horne returns.

52:57.257 --> 53:01.260
Make sure they do not hear
about Laura Palmer's death.

53:01.428 --> 53:04.179
That will blow the whole deal, got it?

53:04.347 --> 53:06.015
- Okay, Bob.
- Thank you, okay.

53:06.182 --> 53:11.604
Okay, Bob. Okay, Bob. Okay.

53:12.856 --> 53:18.903
Julie, what would happen
if I pulled this out?

53:19.070 --> 53:21.196
You wouldn't.

53:23.241 --> 53:25.743
- Oh... Oh. Oh!
- Ha, ha.

53:25.911 --> 53:28.871
Audrey, look what you've done.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.581
Audrey... Oh...

53:30.749 --> 53:32.416
Did they scarf
that whole damn smorgasbord?

53:32.584 --> 53:34.752
- Audrey, honey, don't you go in there.
- I'm hungry.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.462
Audrey, don't...

53:36.630 --> 53:38.881
Don't go in there. Audrey.

54:24.094 --> 54:28.472
Excuse me, is there something wrong,
young, pretty girl?

54:30.266 --> 54:33.435
They found my friend Laura

54:34.646 --> 54:38.315
lying face down on a rocky beach.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.610
Completely naked.

54:43.279 --> 54:45.364
She'd been murdered.

55:08.430 --> 55:09.471
Hey, buddy.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.140
Snake.

55:11.307 --> 55:12.349
We're out of here, man.

55:12.517 --> 55:15.561
Just a sec. Donna's still in there.

55:17.230 --> 55:20.024
- You straightened her out yet?
- I don't know what's up with her, man.

55:21.401 --> 55:26.363
Forget her.
I got it figured, Laura and her.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.534
That cop mentioned something
about the letter J.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.828
We're looking
at some freaking biker.

55:32.996 --> 55:37.166
And some freaking biker's
gonna get his head busted open.

55:37.333 --> 55:39.793
What's his name?
And we'll finish this quick.

55:49.929 --> 55:51.805
Come outside.

55:54.059 --> 55:58.937
Robert, I'll be at home this evening,
if you need a sympathetic ear.

55:59.105 --> 56:02.316
I don't need
any damn sympathetic anything.

56:05.111 --> 56:08.072
You know, dear,
I have no idea what's going on here.

56:08.239 --> 56:10.532
- I...
- Let's just go home.

56:12.952 --> 56:17.247
So you were on a picnic, just the two
of you, way up in the mountains.

56:17.415 --> 56:19.875
Not another soul around?

56:20.627 --> 56:23.712
Is there some law
against having a picnic?

56:25.298 --> 56:27.132
Donna, this is interesting to me.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.553
Because with just the two of you
out there, I can't for the life of me

56:31.721 --> 56:34.306
figure out
how these pictures got taken.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.308
Uh...

56:36.476 --> 56:39.561
Well, that's easy. There was

56:39.729 --> 56:42.898
this, um, hiker that came along.

56:43.066 --> 56:47.152
This woman hiker
had a backpack and...

56:47.737 --> 56:49.196
Um...

56:50.198 --> 56:52.074
We asked her
to take the pictures for us.

56:54.035 --> 56:55.077
What was her name?

56:56.162 --> 56:57.746
I don't know.
I don't think we asked her.

56:57.914 --> 56:58.956
I forgot. I don't know.

57:05.088 --> 57:07.589
Donna, who are you protecting?

57:08.758 --> 57:11.093
Nobody.
That's really what happened.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.429
Does this person's name
start with the letter J?

57:15.306 --> 57:17.349
No, she didn't tell us her name.

57:18.059 --> 57:19.810
Donna, this is serious business.

57:21.312 --> 57:23.397
More serious
than Laura falling in love

57:23.565 --> 57:25.149
with someone
other than her boyfriend.

57:25.316 --> 57:27.192
Much more serious than you know.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.694
Agent Cooper,

57:28.862 --> 57:31.155
the sheriff's ready to roll up
to the site.

57:31.322 --> 57:33.949
And I've got something else
for you here.

57:34.659 --> 57:36.618
You can come on in.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.373
I know Laura was your best friend.

57:45.044 --> 57:46.795
You've been through a lot today.

57:46.963 --> 57:49.131
We're finished here
for the time being.

57:49.757 --> 57:51.425
Okay.

58:07.066 --> 58:10.444
Go ahead, Lucy,
tell Agent Cooper what you heard.

58:10.612 --> 58:11.904
Okay.

58:12.071 --> 58:15.574
Now, after you were done with Bobby
and he was taken back to his cell,

58:15.992 --> 58:19.578
well, then his parents were standing
by the door with his lawyer,

58:19.746 --> 58:21.371
and Bobby, he was released,

58:21.539 --> 58:23.373
and he came out
and he saw his friend Mike,

58:23.541 --> 58:24.875
who was down by the water cooler,

58:25.043 --> 58:26.752
- which is near my desk.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.714
Okay, okay.
Well, I pretended to be typing,

58:30.882 --> 58:32.883
but I was typing
what Mike and Bobby were saying.

58:33.051 --> 58:37.554
And, well, they didn't say exactly
who it was they were talking about,

58:37.722 --> 58:40.515
but anyway,
here's what they were saying.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.602
They said the person we're looking for
is a biker.

58:44.145 --> 58:47.439
Yeah.

58:52.111 --> 58:54.446
Looks like a hog to me.

58:55.156 --> 58:56.990
Holy smoke.

58:57.158 --> 59:00.494
Holy smoke.

59:26.896 --> 59:38.365
The Norwegians are leaving.
The Norwegians are leaving.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.325
The Norwegians are gone.

59:40.493 --> 59:42.911
- Everybody gone? Not good.
- The Norwegians are leaving.

59:43.079 --> 59:44.663
- Norwegians are leaving.
- Listen to me.

59:44.831 --> 59:47.582
You are throwing away the investment
opportunity of a lifetime.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.543
Better that
than to throw a lifetime away.

59:49.711 --> 59:51.586
You stay out of this!

59:51.754 --> 59:55.090
- Ha, ha.
- The Norwegians are leaving.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:43.722
Sheriff.

1:00:45.892 --> 1:00:48.226
Diane, it's 4:10 in the afternoon
at the scene of the crime.

1:00:48.394 --> 1:00:50.562
Here's something
we haven't seen before.

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:53.148
A mound of dirt approximately
a foot and a half in diameter.

1:00:53.316 --> 1:00:55.984
On the top is a gold necklace
with a gold heart.

1:00:56.152 --> 1:00:58.987
Correction, half a gold heart.

1:00:59.155 --> 1:01:02.699
At the base of the mound of dirt
is a torn piece of newsprint

1:01:02.867 --> 1:01:05.952
written with the words,
which appear to be in blood:

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:09.664
"Fire walk with me."

1:01:12.418 --> 1:01:17.172
Sheriff, you and I have gotta find out
who's got the other half of that heart.

1:02:10.852 --> 1:02:12.853
Mrs. Horne.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:17.732
Mrs. Horne, it might help
if you talk to Johnny yourself.

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:19.568
So you think it might help?

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:23.613
Well, you can tell Johnny
one more time

1:02:23.781 --> 1:02:27.909
that Laura isn't coming this afternoon
to work with him.

1:02:28.077 --> 1:02:31.121
Or tomorrow afternoon
or any afternoon.

1:02:31.289 --> 1:02:35.000
Now, what is so difficult
to understand about that?

1:02:44.135 --> 1:02:45.677
Thank you.

1:02:49.974 --> 1:02:52.517
Oh, it fell down.

1:02:53.561 --> 1:02:57.147
I knew Laura.
She was always so nice.

1:02:57.315 --> 1:02:59.316
When was the last time
she came in?

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:03.778
Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly.
Uh, we have so many boxes.

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:05.363
You don't keep records?

1:03:05.531 --> 1:03:07.115
Well, we have plenty of paperwork.

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.451
Can you tell me how long
she's had this box?

1:03:09.619 --> 1:03:12.329
I'd say about six months.

1:03:12.497 --> 1:03:13.830
Um, I could check for you.

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:15.081
Would you, please?

1:03:15.249 --> 1:03:17.125
And close the door on the way out.

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:19.336
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1:03:30.264 --> 1:03:32.182
"Flesh World."

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:34.851
Man, oh, man.

1:03:43.528 --> 1:03:45.987
There's over $10,000 here.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:49.282
That's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.

1:03:54.705 --> 1:03:57.332
Here's a page that's marked.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.630
There's your connection.

1:04:03.798 --> 1:04:05.006
Ronette Pulaski.

1:04:06.384 --> 1:04:08.051
I can't believe it.

1:04:16.727 --> 1:04:20.272
local
and federal law-enforcement officials

1:04:20.439 --> 1:04:23.608
emerging from this abandoned
railway car, which is believed to be...

1:04:23.776 --> 1:04:26.236
Shelly, would you please
turn the television set off?

1:04:26.904 --> 1:04:28.446
Why, Leo? I wanna see this.

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:30.448
Ronette Pulaski, a second...

1:04:30.616 --> 1:04:31.658
Shelly, turn it off.

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:34.494
apparently escaped
her captor and fled to safety,

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:38.790
remains hospitalized
and in critical condition at Cal...

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:42.252
Shelly, sit down here a minute
and help me out.

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.220
What kind of cigarettes
do you smoke?

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:54.347
Whatever's around.

1:04:54.515 --> 1:04:55.932
No, you don't.

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:59.603
You smoke these.
What are these doing here?

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:01.980
Come on, Leo,
I pick up different packs

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:04.232
from the diner all the time,
me and Norma.

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:05.692
There's two things, Shelly.

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:07.611
When I come home,
this house should be clean.

1:05:07.778 --> 1:05:09.446
- And I mean clean.
- Okay.

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:12.198
Number two, you smoke one brand
of cigarettes from now on,

1:05:12.366 --> 1:05:14.534
because if I ever see
two different brands of cigarettes

1:05:14.702 --> 1:05:17.329
in this house again,
I'm gonna snap your neck like a twig.

1:05:18.664 --> 1:05:20.999
Okay, Leo, you have nothing
to worry about with me, darling.

1:05:21.167 --> 1:05:22.959
That's right.

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:37.974
Big Ed's Gas Farm.
This is Ed speaking.

1:05:38.142 --> 1:05:41.436
I'm sorry, I know I promised
not to call you there,

1:05:41.937 --> 1:05:44.064
but I have to see you.

1:05:45.066 --> 1:05:46.733
I feel so bad.

1:05:46.901 --> 1:05:48.818
It's okay.

1:05:50.821 --> 1:05:54.616
Why don't I, uh, meet you
at the Roadhouse around 9:30?

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:56.743
Thank you, Ed.

1:05:57.370 --> 1:05:58.662
I'll see you tonight.

1:05:58.829 --> 1:06:00.955
All right, sweetheart.

1:06:20.017 --> 1:06:21.851
I think I saw a cottontail rabbit.

1:06:22.019 --> 1:06:23.853
It must have been
a snowshoe rabbit.

1:06:24.021 --> 1:06:25.355
- Snowshoe?
- Right.

1:06:25.523 --> 1:06:29.234
Snowshoe. Snowshoe rabbit.

1:06:33.739 --> 1:06:35.198
Who's the babe?

1:06:35.366 --> 1:06:37.992
That's one of the most
beautiful women in the state.

1:06:38.452 --> 1:06:40.120
Mrs. Packard.

1:06:40.287 --> 1:06:42.497
- Packard sawmill?
- Yeah.

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:44.165
Where's Mr. Packard?

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:46.167
Died in a boating accident last year.

1:06:46.335 --> 1:06:48.211
Andrew Packard
practically built this town.

1:06:48.379 --> 1:06:50.463
Brought her over from Hong Kong
six years ago.

1:06:50.631 --> 1:06:54.259
Left her everything,
which didn't exactly please his sister.

1:06:54.427 --> 1:06:56.219
That's her right there.

1:06:56.387 --> 1:06:58.096
The original deep freeze.

1:06:58.264 --> 1:07:00.348
Who's the glad-handing dandy?

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:03.727
Benjamin Horne. Local bigwig.
He owns half the town.

1:07:04.979 --> 1:07:07.564
He's not after her,
he's after her land.

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:15.613
Who's the lady with the log?

1:07:15.781 --> 1:07:17.115
We call her the Log Lady.

1:07:17.283 --> 1:07:18.366
Shh!

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:32.213
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

1:07:35.050 --> 1:07:37.093
Is this thing on?

1:07:37.261 --> 1:07:39.387
- Is this thing on?
- Hang on, Dwayne.

1:07:41.932 --> 1:07:43.933
Sorry. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1:07:44.101 --> 1:07:47.270
Thank you, Mayor Milford.

1:07:47.438 --> 1:07:48.480
Agent Cooper?

1:07:53.277 --> 1:07:55.361
Thank you, sheriff.

1:07:55.821 --> 1:07:56.863
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:07:57.031 --> 1:07:59.741
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:02.619
One year ago, almost to the day,

1:08:02.787 --> 1:08:04.829
in a town in the southwest corner
of this state,

1:08:04.997 --> 1:08:08.124
the body of a young girl named
Teresa Banks was found.

1:08:08.292 --> 1:08:11.795
She had no family. No one
came forward to claim her body.

1:08:11.962 --> 1:08:16.132
It wasn't even news. Until today.

1:08:16.717 --> 1:08:20.470
There are irrefutable similarities that
for obvious reasons I cannot discuss

1:08:20.638 --> 1:08:23.139
that lead us to conclude
that Laura Palmer was the second,

1:08:23.307 --> 1:08:26.935
and Ronette Pulaski would have been
the third, victim of the same killer.

1:08:29.146 --> 1:08:30.355
Now, there is a chance

1:08:30.523 --> 1:08:32.482
that the person
who committed these crimes

1:08:32.650 --> 1:08:37.320
is someone from this town,
possibly even someone you know.

1:08:38.072 --> 1:08:39.531
You are the leaders
of this community.

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:42.867
It is vitally important
that this not turn into a witch hunt.

1:08:43.452 --> 1:08:46.037
I would strongly suggest
a temporary curfew

1:08:46.205 --> 1:08:48.039
for those under 18 years of age.

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:52.126
Keeping your kids off the streets now
may teach them a degree of caution

1:08:52.294 --> 1:08:55.964
that may protect them in the days
and the weeks to come.

1:08:56.131 --> 1:09:00.510
I will remind you
that these crimes occurred at night.

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:20.947
When I left the house,
Sarah was sleeping.

1:09:21.115 --> 1:09:23.992
Leland made it
through the day somehow.

1:09:24.159 --> 1:09:26.494
I'm not sure
I could've done the same.

1:09:26.662 --> 1:09:30.456
Poor dear. Poor Sarah.

1:09:30.624 --> 1:09:36.671
Eileen, the brutality,
the madness of it.

1:09:36.839 --> 1:09:38.673
I know.

1:09:39.174 --> 1:09:44.470
They're not releasing many details,
wisely, I suppose.

1:09:44.638 --> 1:09:49.434
At the scene where it happened...
No one else knows this.

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:51.853
- they found part of a necklace.

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:54.647
Half of a golden heart.

1:09:54.815 --> 1:09:57.025
It was Laura's.

1:09:57.610 --> 1:09:59.235
They know this
because she was wearing it

1:09:59.403 --> 1:10:02.697
in a video of a picnic they found.

1:10:04.033 --> 1:10:05.283
The reason I'm telling you this

1:10:05.451 --> 1:10:08.578
is that Donna
was in the video with her,

1:10:08.746 --> 1:10:11.706
and she won't tell them who shot it
or who else was with them.

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:13.207
What?

1:10:13.375 --> 1:10:18.004
But they think the killer
may have the other half of the heart.

1:10:29.975 --> 1:10:34.145
Donna, which do you like better:

1:10:34.313 --> 1:10:41.319
"The blossom of the evening"
or "the full flower of the evening"?

1:10:43.405 --> 1:10:46.324
Now, listen to me. This is serious.

1:10:46.492 --> 1:10:49.243
- Well, this is serious too.
- Shh.

1:10:49.411 --> 1:10:51.037
I'm going out the window
in a few minutes

1:10:51.205 --> 1:10:52.580
and I need you to cover for me.

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:54.457
Aren't you aware
that there's a curfew?

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:56.084
They just announced it on the radio.

1:10:56.251 --> 1:11:00.046
Yes, I know there's a curfew, Einstein.
That's why I need you to cover for me.

1:11:00.214 --> 1:11:03.675
I suppose this will include
a phone conversation with Mike,

1:11:03.842 --> 1:11:06.719
Mr. Bonehead-Boyfriend.

1:11:07.262 --> 1:11:09.764
No, this is about Laura.

1:11:09.932 --> 1:11:12.642
And it's really, really serious.

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:16.104
Check.

1:11:17.064 --> 1:11:20.108
- Okay, thank you.
- Ha, ha.

1:11:38.293 --> 1:11:39.961
Oh, I'll need to borrow your bike.

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:42.630
Oh, well, then put a little air
in the back tire, would you?

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:46.509
Yeah. Harriet,
don't forget to brush your teeth.

1:11:52.266 --> 1:11:54.475
Actually,

1:11:55.978 --> 1:11:59.147
now that some time has passed,

1:12:00.190 --> 1:12:03.693
I like "the full blossom
of the evening."

1:12:12.870 --> 1:12:14.912
Hey, Snake!

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.499
Don't take any oink-oink
off that pretty pig.

1:12:19.126 --> 1:12:21.586
Don't you worry about that.

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:36.517
Hi, Dr. Hayward.
I'd, uh, like to talk to Donna.

1:12:36.685 --> 1:12:39.729
Donna's upstairs
getting ready for bed, Mike.

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:44.609
You're not drinking and driving,
are you?

1:12:44.777 --> 1:12:49.113
Well, we're all pretty broken up
about what happened today, sir.

1:12:49.281 --> 1:12:52.241
Besides,
Bobby's doing most of the driving.

1:12:53.452 --> 1:12:55.661
I'll see if she wants to come down.

1:12:55.829 --> 1:12:59.540
Mike, would you mind
waiting out here, please?

1:13:06.799 --> 1:13:10.093
The best-laid plans
of mice and men.

1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:14.472
Snake, man. Let's go!

1:13:33.408 --> 1:13:35.785
Where's your sister?

1:13:35.953 --> 1:13:41.082
Dad, I'm gonna tell it to you
and I'm gonna tell it to you straight.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.417
Harriet.

1:13:44.545 --> 1:13:46.796
See that window?

1:13:47.714 --> 1:13:49.632
Later.

1:13:55.139 --> 1:13:57.181
Donna's not here.

1:13:57.349 --> 1:13:58.933
What do you mean? She snuck out?

1:13:59.101 --> 1:14:01.018
Maybe you have an idea
where she might have gone.

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:02.687
Maybe you can help us find her.

1:14:03.105 --> 1:14:05.815
Oh, we'll find her.
Don't you worry about that.

1:14:10.112 --> 1:14:12.029
Roadhouse.

1:14:13.448 --> 1:14:15.116
Let's go.

1:14:24.918 --> 1:14:27.295
Sheriff, I got a call for you
from Dr. Hayward.

1:14:27.462 --> 1:14:30.631
I explained to him that you were
on a stakeout at the Roadhouse

1:14:30.799 --> 1:14:33.968
but he still would very much like
to talk to you.

1:14:34.136 --> 1:14:35.845
Go ahead, Lucy, patch him through.

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:39.682
I'm gonna patch him through
to you now, sheriff.

1:14:41.310 --> 1:14:44.562
I'm patching you through now,
Dr. Hayward.

1:14:45.022 --> 1:14:46.689
Harry, my daughter Donna

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:47.899
snuck out of the house.

1:14:48.066 --> 1:14:49.859
I don't know where she's gone.

1:14:50.027 --> 1:14:55.156
Doc, you rest easy now.
I'm gonna put out an all-points for her.

1:14:55.324 --> 1:14:57.575
We'll keep our eyes peeled.

1:14:57.743 --> 1:14:59.243
Thanks, Harry.

1:14:59.411 --> 1:15:01.370
You betcha.

1:15:02.289 --> 1:15:05.166
Lucy, you take care
of that all-points now, okay?

1:15:05.334 --> 1:15:07.210
All right, sheriff.

1:15:07.377 --> 1:15:09.045
Of course Donna snuck out.

1:15:09.213 --> 1:15:10.504
Meaning what?

1:15:10.672 --> 1:15:13.633
Meaning how else
is she gonna lead us to that biker?

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:14.842
Right.

1:15:18.847 --> 1:15:27.355
Then I saw your smile

1:15:32.527 --> 1:15:35.821
This whole afternoon
I've been hanging drapes.

1:15:35.989 --> 1:15:38.616
- Drapes?
- Drapes.

1:15:39.326 --> 1:15:41.202
Lots of them.

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:43.371
You know how I feel about you, Ed.

1:15:43.538 --> 1:15:46.874
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.

1:15:47.542 --> 1:15:50.544
- It's Tammy Wynette time, darling.
- Yeah?

1:15:51.713 --> 1:15:52.880
What about you and Hank?

1:15:54.049 --> 1:15:58.261
I told you, I'm gonna leave Hank.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.471
Before or after he gets paroled?

1:16:05.102 --> 1:16:07.311
I love you, Ed.

1:16:07.896 --> 1:16:09.563
I'm gonna do what's best
for both of us.

1:16:11.149 --> 1:16:13.901
When your sweetheart's husband's
in the joint for manslaughter,

1:16:14.069 --> 1:16:15.945
the word "parole"
has got a nasty ring to it.

1:16:18.907 --> 1:16:22.076
Falling

1:16:22.244 --> 1:16:25.454
Falling

1:16:25.622 --> 1:16:35.089
Are we falling in love?

1:16:38.719 --> 1:16:40.344
You know why I'm whittling?

1:16:40.512 --> 1:16:44.849
Okay, I'll bite again.
Why are you whittling?

1:16:45.017 --> 1:16:46.434
Because that's what you do
in a town

1:16:46.601 --> 1:16:50.646
where a yellow light
still means slow down, not speed up.

1:16:58.739 --> 1:17:00.948
Mike and Bobby.

1:17:01.533 --> 1:17:04.452
They're liable
to be a little trouble this evening.

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:13.627
There is a love

1:17:14.629 --> 1:17:19.050
Meant for me

1:17:19.217 --> 1:17:21.886
The nightingale

1:17:24.097 --> 1:17:28.851
It flew to me

1:17:29.019 --> 1:17:32.063
And told me

1:17:34.149 --> 1:17:39.904
That it found my love

1:17:41.990 --> 1:17:45.701
Scotty, Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

1:17:49.164 --> 1:17:51.999
Oh, what a wonderful world.

1:17:56.421 --> 1:17:57.838
Looks like sooner than later.

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:05.054
Why don't you whistle
for a little backup?

1:18:05.555 --> 1:18:07.515
I can see
which way the wind's blowing.

1:18:07.682 --> 1:18:11.519
Lucy, get us a backup unit down here
at the Roadhouse right away.

1:18:11.686 --> 1:18:13.062
Make that two backup units.

1:18:13.230 --> 1:18:17.316
And call Dr. Hayward. Tell him
we found his daughter and she's fine.

1:18:17.484 --> 1:18:19.693
All right, sheriff.

1:18:35.001 --> 1:18:36.627
Donna!

1:18:37.379 --> 1:18:40.589
What are you sneaking around for?
Everybody's looking for you.

1:18:47.639 --> 1:18:50.057
- You and Laura, you're the same.
- Get your hands off me!

1:18:50.392 --> 1:18:51.809
Leave me alone. Get off me!

1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:54.019
- No!
- Get your hands off me!

1:18:54.187 --> 1:18:55.563
Let go of me!

1:18:55.730 --> 1:18:57.731
- No!
- That's enough!

1:18:58.275 --> 1:19:01.569
You heard him. Let me go.

1:19:02.446 --> 1:19:05.448
Lights out, Mr. Monkey-Wrench.

1:19:13.665 --> 1:19:15.749
- You guys got it covered?
- That's right. No sweat.

1:19:15.917 --> 1:19:17.418
Don't worry, I'll take you to James.

1:19:25.177 --> 1:19:26.260
Joey Paulson.

1:19:26.761 --> 1:19:30.139
- That's a J.
- No, he's taking her to somebody else.

1:19:30.307 --> 1:19:33.767
I suppose you want me
to follow them at a discreet distance.

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:36.312
Harry, you're all right.

1:20:04.466 --> 1:20:06.467
Hold on.

1:20:07.219 --> 1:20:09.720
Do you think they spotted us?

1:20:11.139 --> 1:20:12.473
Give me a doughnut.

1:20:30.992 --> 1:20:33.577
Well, Harry, I think we lost them.

1:20:35.830 --> 1:20:38.666
Man, smell those trees.

1:20:38.833 --> 1:20:41.502
Smell those Douglas firs.

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:43.837
I think I hear them.

1:20:45.173 --> 1:20:48.008
- What's down there?
- An old logging road.

1:20:48.176 --> 1:20:51.929
The only access is five miles back
at the Packard Mill.

1:20:52.430 --> 1:20:54.515
And I told Doc Hayward
his daughter was okay.

1:20:54.683 --> 1:20:56.100
My fault, Harry, not yours.

1:20:56.268 --> 1:20:59.186
- Thanks, Joey.
- No problem, James.

1:21:21.334 --> 1:21:24.545
James, they're looking for you.

1:21:24.713 --> 1:21:29.216
I'm gonna talk to them.
But I think they're gonna lock me up.

1:21:29.384 --> 1:21:30.718
Why?

1:21:31.636 --> 1:21:34.471
I don't have an alibi for last night.
I was with her.

1:21:34.639 --> 1:21:36.432
James, what happened last night?

1:21:36.891 --> 1:21:39.893
It was kind of like a nightmare.

1:21:40.061 --> 1:21:42.104
Donna, she was a different person.

1:21:43.231 --> 1:21:44.398
What are you saying?

1:21:44.566 --> 1:21:47.901
I'm telling you, there were things
she was involved with.

1:21:48.069 --> 1:21:52.906
Things she let herself get pulled into.
Things she thought you'd hate her for.

1:21:53.074 --> 1:21:54.575
She said,
"There are things about me."

1:21:54.743 --> 1:21:57.244
She said,
"Even Donna doesn't know me."

1:21:58.955 --> 1:22:00.581
I knew her.

1:22:00.749 --> 1:22:03.250
I knew her
better than she thought I did.

1:22:03.418 --> 1:22:07.588
Donna, she said something
about a guy getting killed.

1:22:08.381 --> 1:22:10.507
- Who?
- She didn't say.

1:22:10.675 --> 1:22:12.760
But she said

1:22:12.927 --> 1:22:17.765
Bobby told her
that he killed this guy.

1:22:18.725 --> 1:22:20.934
Oh, my God.

1:22:21.102 --> 1:22:24.271
This is why I had to see you.

1:22:24.773 --> 1:22:29.568
It all makes some kind of terrible sense
that she died, that someone killed her.

1:22:29.736 --> 1:22:31.445
I don't know, I can't explain it.

1:22:32.781 --> 1:22:35.157
I didn't know whether
to believe any of this last night.

1:22:35.325 --> 1:22:37.951
I mean, half the time
she wasn't making any sense.

1:22:38.995 --> 1:22:40.871
I couldn't calm her down.

1:22:41.039 --> 1:22:42.956
I could hardly keep her on the bike.

1:22:43.124 --> 1:22:48.796
We came to the light
at Sparkwood and 21, and she...

1:22:49.589 --> 1:22:53.258
She put her hands around my neck

1:22:54.219 --> 1:22:59.139
and she screamed she loved me.

1:23:01.267 --> 1:23:03.477
I looked into her eyes.
They were clear.

1:23:03.937 --> 1:23:08.732
It was like she was Laura again.
She was so sad.

1:23:08.900 --> 1:23:10.984
She sounded so desperate.

1:23:12.654 --> 1:23:17.116
Then she ran off.
I let her go and she died.

1:23:17.283 --> 1:23:19.451
Oh, it's okay.

1:23:21.037 --> 1:23:24.415
It's not your fault, James.

1:23:25.667 --> 1:23:27.668
It's okay.

1:23:28.837 --> 1:23:33.424
James, it's all right. James.

1:23:46.271 --> 1:23:48.522
Oh, my God.

1:23:49.315 --> 1:23:50.691
I'm sorry.

1:23:53.153 --> 1:23:55.362
Oh, my God.

1:23:58.450 --> 1:24:00.701
I changed my mind.

1:24:00.869 --> 1:24:03.287
I'm not sorry.

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:27.060
James...

1:24:31.024 --> 1:24:33.484
Oh, James.

1:24:34.444 --> 1:24:37.321
Those are sirens.

1:24:38.907 --> 1:24:41.575
I've got to go to the police.

1:24:42.452 --> 1:24:43.827
I don't have an alibi.

1:24:44.746 --> 1:24:47.414
After she left, I just rode around
most of the night.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.751
James, the necklace
you gave Laura with the golden heart.

1:24:50.919 --> 1:24:52.294
You have to give me the other half.

1:24:53.129 --> 1:24:54.171
Why?

1:24:54.339 --> 1:24:56.256
Because they found the half
where she was killed

1:24:56.424 --> 1:24:58.425
and they think the killer
will have the other half.

1:24:58.593 --> 1:25:01.053
If you go down there
with the necklace and no alibi...

1:25:01.221 --> 1:25:03.430
- What about you?
- I'll get rid of it.

1:25:03.598 --> 1:25:06.266
- No.
- I'll hide it.

1:25:06.434 --> 1:25:09.770
All right. We'll bury it.

1:25:09.938 --> 1:25:11.939
Okay.

1:25:12.106 --> 1:25:15.400
- Right here.
- Okay.

1:25:47.517 --> 1:25:48.559
I'll take you home.

1:26:12.876 --> 1:26:15.168
- What goes around comes around.
- Around and around.

1:26:37.025 --> 1:26:39.318
- That's not Joey, that's James Hurley.
- He'll do.

1:26:39.485 --> 1:26:43.864
James, stand away from the bike.
Stand away from the girl.

1:26:44.032 --> 1:26:45.616
Put your hands behind your head.

1:26:46.242 --> 1:26:47.701
He didn't do anything.

1:26:47.869 --> 1:26:50.120
She's probably right.

1:26:55.043 --> 1:26:56.793
James...

1:26:56.961 --> 1:26:58.211
He didn't do anything.

1:27:02.175 --> 1:27:03.717
Lucy, get an arrest form ready.

1:27:07.347 --> 1:27:08.847
Doc, I'm gonna release her to you,

1:27:09.015 --> 1:27:12.351
but I want her back up here for
questioning first thing in the morning.

1:27:12.518 --> 1:27:13.560
All right, Harry.

1:27:13.728 --> 1:27:17.397
Andy, Hawk,
put James back in Number 4.

1:27:22.487 --> 1:27:23.904
James.

1:27:24.572 --> 1:27:25.822
It's gonna be all right.

1:27:41.005 --> 1:27:42.839
You.

1:27:53.226 --> 1:27:55.852
We'll be back to check on you later.

1:28:02.402 --> 1:28:05.070
Good night, officers.

1:28:24.799 --> 1:28:26.842
I'm sorry, Dad.

1:28:29.512 --> 1:28:34.141
Donna, after what happened today,
I'm sure you understand

1:28:34.308 --> 1:28:37.519
what you put your mother
and me through tonight.

1:28:38.771 --> 1:28:41.773
But I also know you well enough
to know you wouldn't have done it

1:28:41.941 --> 1:28:44.359
unless you had a good reason.

1:28:47.780 --> 1:28:51.658
But we also have another problem
facing us, young lady.

1:28:53.327 --> 1:28:55.996
Where's your sister's bicycle?

1:28:57.081 --> 1:29:00.083
Uh, I left it at the Roadhouse.

1:29:00.251 --> 1:29:03.170
Well, we'll have to go get it.

1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:09.885
I understand you promised Harriet
you'd put some air in the back tire.

1:29:10.053 --> 1:29:12.095
Yes, I did.

1:29:14.515 --> 1:29:17.976
We're so thankful
to have a daughter like you.

1:29:25.943 --> 1:29:28.528
A policeman's dream.

1:29:28.696 --> 1:29:32.032
Yeah.
Lucy sets it up for us every night.

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:34.159
Sheriff, is everything okay?

1:29:34.327 --> 1:29:36.912
There's extra jelly doughnuts
for Agent Cooper

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:38.705
and there's some extra decaf.

1:29:38.873 --> 1:29:42.751
You know, Andy's been drinking
so much caffeinated coffee lately...

1:29:42.919 --> 1:29:44.211
Thank you, Lucy.

1:29:44.378 --> 1:29:48.173
You can go back to work now,
and no listening.

1:29:48.341 --> 1:29:50.300
Sheriff, that reminds me.

1:29:51.302 --> 1:29:55.097
Can you recommend to me
a good inexpensive hotel or motel?

1:29:55.264 --> 1:29:57.933
Now, it doesn't have to be fancy,
and I mean that.

1:29:58.101 --> 1:30:00.310
I can get you a good rate
up at The Great Northern.

1:30:00.478 --> 1:30:02.938
Because, you know, I think
I'm gonna be here for some time,

1:30:03.106 --> 1:30:06.316
and these motels,
they'll promise you a good rate,

1:30:06.484 --> 1:30:08.485
and when you get there
it's a whole different story.

1:30:08.653 --> 1:30:13.031
Now, all I need is a bed,
a bathroom, a telephone,

1:30:13.199 --> 1:30:15.659
and sometimes a television,
in the unlikely event that one day

1:30:15.827 --> 1:30:17.911
I'll get a chance to knock off early.

1:30:18.079 --> 1:30:21.373
I can get you a good rate
up at The Great Northern.

1:30:21.791 --> 1:30:23.500
Sold.

1:30:23.668 --> 1:30:26.419
Well, tomorrow comes early.

1:30:31.467 --> 1:30:34.094
Diane, it's 12:28 a.m.

1:30:34.262 --> 1:30:37.347
Looks like I'll be staying locally at a
place called The Great Northern Hotel.

1:30:37.515 --> 1:30:39.558
Sheriff's getting me a rate.

1:30:43.604 --> 1:30:46.648
When you least expect it.

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.146
Hello, sheriff.

1:31:27.982 --> 1:31:29.774
Hey, Jo.

1:31:30.359 --> 1:31:34.321
I understand you wanted
to see the sheriff up here.

1:31:34.488 --> 1:31:37.490
Yes, I did.

1:31:38.826 --> 1:31:40.827
Right over here.

1:31:52.590 --> 1:31:54.341
He's here again.

1:31:54.508 --> 1:31:58.803
Let's get together and talk about it.

1:31:58.971 --> 1:32:12.901
All right.

1:32:19.533 --> 1:32:25.538
It must have happened
about this time 24 hours ago.

1:32:27.667 --> 1:32:29.417
I'm afraid.
