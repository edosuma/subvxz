That's probably fine.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.018
Hmm.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.018
Betsy!
Aah!

00:54.020 --> 00:57.011
For the last time, Betsy,
throw these away.

00:57.013 --> 00:59.019
You know how I feel
about farro seeds.

00:59.021 --> 01:01.004
Or, if you want,

01:01.006 --> 01:02.023
you can just leave them
in the main room somewhere.

01:03.001 --> 01:04.014
I'm gonna make Hedgehog clean it
on Saturday

01:04.016 --> 01:06.015
and tell her it's part
of her witch training.

01:07.022 --> 01:11.014
I wonder what these seeds do.

01:11.016 --> 01:14.011
Hm.
That's handy.

01:27.002 --> 01:29.005
Who rang that bell?

01:29.007 --> 01:30.022
Uh, me, sir?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.008
I need to get something
identified.

01:33.010 --> 01:37.008
Okay.
Put the bag through the door.

01:38.010 --> 01:41.017
Hm!
These are farro seeds.

01:41.019 --> 01:45.020
According to my research, you
can read the future with
these.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.020
But you shouldn't.
Why not?

01:47.022 --> 01:49.015
I just wouldn't, okay?

01:49.017 --> 01:51.021
You can leave them here
if you want.

01:51.023 --> 01:54.020
I'll dispose of them
for you.

01:56.014 --> 01:59.012
Okay. So this amount of seeds
should be able to show me

01:59.014 --> 02:01.012
about five years
into the future.

02:01.014 --> 02:03.008
So high school, I guess.

02:03.010 --> 02:05.021
All I have to do is nudge
the first one in the line

02:06.000 --> 02:07.006
and then I'll know.

02:07.008 --> 02:09.021
And then I'll...know.

02:14.019 --> 02:16.006
Okay.
I get it.

02:16.008 --> 02:17.021
I'm still gonna do it, though.

02:22.013 --> 02:25.014
Yep.
This is high school, all right.

02:25.016 --> 02:28.001
Valedictorian?

02:28.003 --> 02:31.008
Oh, my gosh! Hedgehog!
You beautiful Hedgehog.

02:31.010 --> 02:32.018
I got to see this up close.

02:32.020 --> 02:35.022
No way, Petunia.
School isn't for learning.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.013
It's for lounging.

02:37.015 --> 02:39.001
Oscar?

02:39.003 --> 02:43.000
Wow.
Is he chewing gum in school?

02:44.013 --> 02:47.000
D-Detention?

02:47.002 --> 02:48.013
Oh, my gosh.

02:48.015 --> 02:52.001
High-school Oscar is a --
a ne'er-do-well!

02:52.003 --> 02:54.002
I got to prevent this
from happening.

02:54.004 --> 02:55.007
Hey-oh!

02:55.009 --> 02:57.000
Don't you knock anymore?

02:57.002 --> 02:58.003
I got us two bananas

02:58.005 --> 03:00.006
from yesterday's banana bin
at Djembe's.

03:00.008 --> 03:02.002
You're only supposed to
take one.

03:02.004 --> 03:04.019
But you know me.
I'm kind of like a bad boy.

03:04.021 --> 03:07.007
B-But you're not!
You're a good boy!

03:07.009 --> 03:09.021
You have to return
that extra banana right now.

03:09.023 --> 03:12.014
But --
Get out of here
with that contraband!

03:12.016 --> 03:14.020
Oh...kay.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.010
Knock-knock.

03:19.012 --> 03:22.014
I only have one banana, and I'd
like to eat it in here if I may.

03:22.016 --> 03:24.006
You may come in.

03:24.008 --> 03:25.021
What's up with you?

03:25.023 --> 03:27.018
Don't worry about it.
I'm trying to protect you,

03:27.020 --> 03:29.019
but I'm doing it by doing
something I shouldn't be,

03:29.021 --> 03:32.006
and I want you to turn and face
the wall while I do it, okay?

03:32.008 --> 03:34.017
Yep.
No follow-up questions.

03:40.018 --> 03:42.007
Don't worry, Petunia.

03:42.009 --> 03:44.009
There's no losers
in Checkers Club.

03:44.011 --> 03:46.009
Only new friends.

03:46.011 --> 03:48.017
That's my little bell pepper.

03:48.019 --> 03:53.000
I knew I'd figure this
all ou-u-t -- What?

03:53.002 --> 03:54.011
The people's choice?

03:54.013 --> 03:56.016
I thought this was based
on grades!

03:56.018 --> 03:58.008
No!

03:58.010 --> 04:01.008
Oscar's <i>not</i> <i>stealing the banana</i>
kept him out of detention,

04:01.010 --> 04:04.019
but not eating the banana kept
<i>me</i> <i>from being valedictorian.</i>

04:04.021 --> 04:05.017
Why?

04:05.019 --> 04:08.003
Oscar!
Go steal me that banana.

04:08.005 --> 04:10.008
Get me the whole basket
of bananas.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.019
You got it!

04:15.014 --> 04:18.016
Shh!
Don't tell on us.

04:18.018 --> 04:21.000
Bananas!

04:21.002 --> 04:23.015
Ah! Gimme!
Mm! Mm-nom-nom-nom.

04:23.017 --> 04:26.015
I'm gonna need you to go back
to your corner real quick.

04:28.022 --> 04:31.018
Okay.
I've re-eaten the stolen banana.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.012
So, logically,
I should be back

04:33.014 --> 04:35.011
to being valedictorian
this time.

04:36.023 --> 04:39.015
This is what the slug man
in the glass warned me about.

04:39.017 --> 04:43.000
But I'm in too deep now.
I have to know!

04:45.023 --> 04:49.004
What?
Am I in detention now?!

04:49.006 --> 04:53.004
Valedictorian -- of detention?

04:53.006 --> 04:54.012
No!

04:54.014 --> 04:55.012
Oscar!

04:55.014 --> 04:57.014
Yes?

05:07.023 --> 05:11.002
Oh, no.
I have a bowl cut?

05:13.023 --> 05:18.002
Oh, am I on a date
with Chauncey?

05:26.007 --> 05:27.005
Whoa.

05:27.007 --> 05:30.001
Am I at...prom?

05:30.003 --> 05:32.014
Run!
Someone help!

05:32.016 --> 05:33.020
What?
No!

05:33.022 --> 05:34.021
Oscar?

05:34.023 --> 05:37.010
Chauncey!

05:37.012 --> 05:39.019
He didn't stand a chaunce.

05:39.021 --> 05:42.023
What's going on?

05:43.001 --> 05:44.017
Every man for himself!

05:44.019 --> 05:46.002
No.

05:46.004 --> 05:48.001
It can't be.

05:48.003 --> 05:49.011
Me?

05:49.013 --> 05:50.020
No!

05:57.002 --> 05:58.013
No!

05:58.015 --> 06:00.013
Are you okay, Hedgehog?

06:00.015 --> 06:02.014
Oscar, I need you to take
all the bananas

06:02.016 --> 06:04.004
and blend them
into a smoothie.

06:04.006 --> 06:05.019
But I don't have
a blender.

06:05.021 --> 06:08.009
Use your fists,
boo-boo!

06:08.011 --> 06:10.018
All right, Hedgehog.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.022
I need to know
what's going on.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.002
Nothing's going on.

06:14.004 --> 06:16.013
Be a good boy
and go back to the corner.

06:18.012 --> 06:21.014
Hedgehog.
For real, what's happening?

06:22.023 --> 06:25.005
So much is happening.

06:25.007 --> 06:27.019
I read the future.

06:27.021 --> 06:31.014
And in the future,
you had become...rotten.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.001
I figured variances
in banana activity

06:34.003 --> 06:36.014
can have profound effects
on the future.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.009
I've been trying
to fix things,

06:38.011 --> 06:41.011
but I just keep messing up
the future even more.

06:41.013 --> 06:42.013
Hmm.

06:42.015 --> 06:44.019
Where'd you even get
these farro seeds?

06:44.021 --> 06:46.020
The witch school.

06:46.022 --> 06:48.023
And there was this man
in the glass

06:49.001 --> 06:51.004
who did give me advice
not to use them.

06:51.006 --> 06:54.002
But it was just advice,
you know?

06:54.004 --> 06:58.006
I think we need to go back
to the man in the glass.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Wow. You'll really miss him
if you're not looking for him.

07:02.002 --> 07:05.021
Ah. You're back.
I told you not to use them.

07:05.023 --> 07:08.016
I know.
But I was curious.

07:08.018 --> 07:10.004
And so I did it.

07:10.006 --> 07:13.005
And now I made the future
way worse than it was gonna be.

07:13.007 --> 07:14.010
How do I fix this?

07:14.012 --> 07:16.019
The only way
to get rid of your futures

07:16.021 --> 07:18.016
is to get rid
of the seeds.

07:18.018 --> 07:20.010
And the only way to do that

07:20.012 --> 07:25.004
is to grind them up
in a magical spice grinder.

07:25.006 --> 07:29.014
But the only one on this island
is in Susie's kitchen!

07:29.016 --> 07:34.004
In the third kitchen cabinet,
next to the fridge.

07:34.006 --> 07:36.010
Left door squeaks
a little on the hinges,

07:36.012 --> 07:39.003
so use the right one.

07:39.005 --> 07:40.007
Okay.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.009
Susie has no idea
anything happened,

07:42.011 --> 07:44.021
so this is just me
asking a normal question

07:44.023 --> 07:47.007
and you
on a normal tag-along.

07:48.015 --> 07:50.007
Hm!

07:51.018 --> 07:53.001
What is it?

07:53.003 --> 07:55.008
You guys are interrupting
my late-afternoon sulk.

07:55.010 --> 07:58.002
I had a magic question.
Can we come inside?

07:58.004 --> 07:59.018
What's <i>your</i> <i>deal?</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:01.016
Just a normal tag-along.

08:01.018 --> 08:04.003
Mm, all right.
Come in.

08:06.013 --> 08:07.023
After you.

08:08.001 --> 08:10.019
So, what was the spell
you had a question about?

08:10.021 --> 08:14.015
It's somewhere around...
<i>these</i> <i>pages.</i>

08:14.017 --> 08:17.017
Third kitchen cabinet,
next to the fridge.

08:20.007 --> 08:23.007
Check the table of contents.
Uh, which page is that?

08:23.009 --> 08:26.012
Right.
The right door.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.002
Aah!

08:33.004 --> 08:35.013
Did you hear someth--
Whoops!

08:37.004 --> 08:40.014
Hedgehog, stop fooling around.
What do you need help with?

08:40.016 --> 08:43.005
Oh! Uh, h-here's the spell
I had a question about.

08:43.007 --> 08:46.002
A door-opening spell?
Really?

08:46.004 --> 08:48.010
I, uh, can't get a handle
of it.

08:48.012 --> 08:50.010
Okay. Well,
all you have to do is say...

08:50.012 --> 08:52.021
"Welcome!"

08:52.023 --> 08:54.015
See?
N-Now you try.

08:54.017 --> 08:56.008
Welcome.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.018
No!

08:57.020 --> 08:59.011
Welcome!

08:59.013 --> 09:01.005
Welcome.
No!

09:01.007 --> 09:02.015
Welcome!

09:02.017 --> 09:03.023
Welcome.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.011
Hedgehog.

09:05.013 --> 09:07.006
Welcome!

09:07.008 --> 09:09.017
Hedgehog, if you're not even
gonna pay attention --

09:09.019 --> 09:12.003
What are you thumbs-upping?

09:13.001 --> 09:14.018
What are you up to?!

09:14.020 --> 09:16.000
O-Okay.
They're farro seeds.

09:16.002 --> 09:17.015
We're just trying to erase
the future.

09:17.017 --> 09:19.006
Please just let us
erase it.

09:19.008 --> 09:20.009
Susie, wait.

09:20.011 --> 09:22.011
Oscar has nothing to do
with this.

09:22.013 --> 09:23.023
<i>I</i> <i>messed up the future.</i>

09:24.001 --> 09:26.021
It was my idea to use
your magical spice grinder.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.009
Who told you about that?

09:28.011 --> 09:31.001
The slug man in the booth
in the witch school.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.017
Pete?!
That guy's the worst!

09:32.019 --> 09:34.020
He helped me move
into this cabin centuries ago,

09:34.022 --> 09:36.016
took copious notes
of everything I owned,

09:36.018 --> 09:39.008
and he's been sending people
here to use my items ever since.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.003
That's not even true
what he said.

09:41.005 --> 09:43.008
You can't erase the future.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.008
Come with me.

09:46.015 --> 09:48.014
Welcome!

09:48.016 --> 09:53.020
Well, I feel betrayed.

09:53.022 --> 09:55.004
Come.
Have a seat.

09:55.006 --> 09:57.008
I call the corner!

09:59.006 --> 10:01.003
So you did a farro reading
and you saw

10:01.005 --> 10:04.005
like 80 freaky, contradictory
futures, huh, Hedgehog?

10:04.007 --> 10:06.005
Yes.
It was horrible.

10:06.007 --> 10:07.004
Aah!

10:07.006 --> 10:09.020
What are you doing?

10:14.005 --> 10:15.012
Whoa.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.010
The future isn't defined
by one single farro seed

10:18.012 --> 10:20.020
because there is no one
definite future.

10:20.022 --> 10:24.005
Each farro seed is just one
possible outcome.

10:24.007 --> 10:27.002
So when you're reading farro,
that's all it is.

10:27.004 --> 10:28.016
It's just a possibility.

10:28.018 --> 10:32.013
It might seem like it's your
guaranteed future, but it's not.

10:32.015 --> 10:34.002
The only guaranteed thing

10:34.004 --> 10:36.021
is that there's an endless
amount of ways it could go.

10:36.023 --> 10:38.007
Doesn't that scare you?

10:38.009 --> 10:40.008
Mm, sometimes.

10:41.006 --> 10:43.011
But when I get stressed
about the future,

10:43.013 --> 10:45.011
I come down here,
and the farro reminds me

10:45.013 --> 10:47.011
that worrying about the me
of the future

10:47.013 --> 10:50.007
is to worry
millions of times over.

10:50.009 --> 10:52.005
That's too much
for the me of today.

10:52.007 --> 10:54.009
So I didn't
mess anything up?

10:54.011 --> 10:55.021
Not the future, at least.

10:55.023 --> 10:58.015
Maybe messed yourself up
worrying so much over it,

10:58.017 --> 11:00.021
but you'll be okay.

11:03.008 --> 11:05.006
Hey, guys.
What are we talking about?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.021
So much is happening.
