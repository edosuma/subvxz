01:52.889 --> 01:55.278
There are more than yesterday.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.878
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

02:20.729 --> 02:24.722
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

03:36.329 --> 03:38.968
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

03:41.769 --> 03:42.599
Oh, God!

04:32.809 --> 04:35.846
The object of this massive tribute...

04:36.369 --> 04:38.007
...died as he had always lived:

04:38.249 --> 04:39.204
A private man...

04:39.409 --> 04:40.478
...without wealth...

04:40.689 --> 04:42.042
...without property...

04:42.289 --> 04:44.644
...without official title or office.

04:45.609 --> 04:47.042
Mahatma Gandhi...

04:47.249 --> 04:49.001
...was not the commander of armies...

04:49.249 --> 04:51.683
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

04:52.289 --> 04:54.757
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

04:54.969 --> 04:56.641
...or artistic gift.

04:57.049 --> 04:58.038
Yet men...

04:58.369 --> 05:02.806
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

05:03.009 --> 05:04.840
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

05:05.049 --> 05:07.609
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

05:07.809 --> 05:10.562
...who led his country to freedom.

05:11.609 --> 05:13.645
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

05:14.489 --> 05:16.798
...the American secretary of state:

05:17.369 --> 05:20.088
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

05:20.369 --> 05:23.088
...for the conscience of all mankind.

05:23.609 --> 05:24.803
He was a man...

05:25.009 --> 05:26.442
...who made humility...

05:27.009 --> 05:28.203
...and simple truth...

05:28.729 --> 05:31.323
...more powerful than empires."

05:31.569 --> 05:33.400
And Albert Einstein added:

05:33.849 --> 05:38.081
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

05:38.329 --> 05:40.365
...ever in flesh and blood...

05:41.209 --> 05:43.279
...walked upon this earth."

06:25.089 --> 06:25.885
Tell me...

06:26.649 --> 06:28.446
...do you think about hell?

06:29.529 --> 06:31.485
No, neither do I.

06:31.689 --> 06:33.680
But this man here...

06:33.929 --> 06:37.160
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe...

06:41.169 --> 06:42.238
Excuse me, sir.

06:42.449 --> 06:44.804
How long have you been
in South Africa?

06:45.289 --> 06:46.085
A week.

06:46.289 --> 06:48.644
I don't know how you got a ticket.

06:49.569 --> 06:51.560
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

06:52.369 --> 06:54.485
Why, I have a ticket.

06:54.929 --> 06:56.885
A first-class ticket.

06:57.969 --> 07:00.563
- How did you get it?
- I sent for it in the post.

07:00.809 --> 07:02.003
I'm an attorney.
I didn't...

07:02.249 --> 07:04.319
There are no coloured attorneys
in South Africa.

07:04.569 --> 07:05.684
Sit where you belong!

07:05.889 --> 07:07.959
I'll take your luggage back, sir.

07:08.209 --> 07:10.006
Just a moment, please.

07:10.849 --> 07:11.884
You see?

07:12.729 --> 07:15.448
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

07:15.649 --> 07:18.641
I'm going to conduct a case
for an Indian trading firm.

07:18.889 --> 07:23.360
Didn't you hear me? There are no
coloured attorneys in South Africa.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.839
I was called to the bar in London...

07:26.289 --> 07:29.167
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.200
I am, therefore, an attorney.

07:31.449 --> 07:33.838
And since I am,
in your eyes, coloured...

07:34.289 --> 07:36.245
...I think we can deduce
that there is at least...

07:36.449 --> 07:38.246
...one coloured attorney
in South Africa.

07:39.289 --> 07:41.280
Smart bloody Kaffir!

07:41.529 --> 07:42.518
Throw him out.

07:42.769 --> 07:44.999
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

07:45.249 --> 07:47.524
...or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

07:47.769 --> 07:49.441
But I always go first class!

08:56.129 --> 08:58.085
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

08:58.369 --> 09:00.599
Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.

09:00.809 --> 09:03.039
I do not expect
to travel first class.

09:03.249 --> 09:05.558
- In England, I was a poor student.
- That was England.

09:05.769 --> 09:07.361
This is part of England's Empire.

09:07.569 --> 09:12.120
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

09:12.369 --> 09:15.042
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

09:15.289 --> 09:18.838
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

09:19.049 --> 09:21.882
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.484
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.048
But that is very unchristian...

09:26.289 --> 09:28.405
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

09:28.649 --> 09:32.278
...lndians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

09:35.129 --> 09:38.201
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

09:38.449 --> 09:39.962
...but you can't walk down
the street with him?

09:40.489 --> 09:41.638
Well, I can.

09:42.129 --> 09:44.962
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

09:45.169 --> 09:47.683
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

09:57.369 --> 09:59.166
Well, then it must be fought.

09:59.409 --> 10:01.639
We are children of God
like everyone else.

10:01.849 --> 10:03.077
Allah be praised!

10:03.329 --> 10:05.684
And what battalions
will you call upon?

10:09.849 --> 10:11.362
I will write to the press...

10:11.569 --> 10:13.719
...here and in England.

10:14.169 --> 10:15.238
I will use the courts.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.798
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is...

10:18.009 --> 10:20.477
We are members of the Empire.

10:21.809 --> 10:24.528
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

10:25.129 --> 10:28.201
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

10:28.449 --> 10:32.328
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

10:32.649 --> 10:36.437
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

10:36.689 --> 10:39.283
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

10:40.609 --> 10:44.079
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

11:02.849 --> 11:05.727
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

11:07.489 --> 11:10.959
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

11:13.329 --> 11:16.605
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

11:16.809 --> 11:20.279
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

11:21.649 --> 11:23.128
Some of them are leaving.

11:31.929 --> 11:33.408
"Ladies and gentlemen:

11:33.649 --> 11:37.642
We have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

11:37.849 --> 11:40.886
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

11:41.489 --> 11:43.081
We do not seek conflict.

11:43.809 --> 11:47.119
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

11:47.489 --> 11:52.005
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

11:52.249 --> 11:55.400
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

11:57.209 --> 12:00.565
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

12:00.769 --> 12:02.999
...which we must carry
at all times...

12:03.249 --> 12:05.968
...but which no European
even has to have.

12:06.209 --> 12:08.928
The first step towards
changing our status...

12:09.329 --> 12:12.162
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

12:20.169 --> 12:21.045
Now?

12:26.249 --> 12:30.242
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

12:32.689 --> 12:34.600
"We do not want to ignite...

12:35.689 --> 12:38.078
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

12:38.969 --> 12:39.958
But we ask you...

12:40.769 --> 12:43.283
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

12:43.529 --> 12:46.202
...to help us light up the sky...

12:46.769 --> 12:49.602
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

12:49.809 --> 12:52.846
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

12:54.929 --> 12:58.808
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

13:00.129 --> 13:03.007
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire...

13:03.209 --> 13:04.483
You bloody dog!

13:10.409 --> 13:11.285
Those passes...

13:11.929 --> 13:13.760
...are government property!

13:14.489 --> 13:18.084
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

13:29.249 --> 13:30.443
Take him away.

13:51.529 --> 13:52.598
You little...

13:53.169 --> 13:54.158
...Sammy...

13:54.769 --> 13:55.599
...bastard!

13:57.529 --> 13:59.918
Now! Are there any more?

14:00.249 --> 14:03.207
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

14:26.249 --> 14:27.284
Let me go!

14:28.769 --> 14:30.202
Let me go!

14:48.529 --> 14:49.598
Stop.

15:08.049 --> 15:10.279
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

15:10.489 --> 15:11.842
<i>The worst was the Daily Mail.</i>

15:12.049 --> 15:13.323
They said the burning of passes...

15:13.529 --> 15:16.521
- Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
...-was the most significant act...

15:16.729 --> 15:19.846
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.244
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.481
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

15:27.049 --> 15:29.882
"A High Court judge confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

15:30.129 --> 15:33.360
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

15:33.569 --> 15:36.561
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

15:36.849 --> 15:38.441
I told you about English law.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.487
As I told you about English policemen.

15:42.369 --> 15:43.688
Yes?

15:44.889 --> 15:47.449
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

15:47.809 --> 15:49.845
And I am glad to be back.

15:50.049 --> 15:50.845
Come.

15:52.729 --> 15:54.287
Mind your face.

16:00.689 --> 16:03.647
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

16:05.169 --> 16:06.158
Come, come.

16:11.769 --> 16:14.920
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

16:15.169 --> 16:18.286
They're boys and they're Indian.

16:20.169 --> 16:23.878
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

16:29.769 --> 16:31.282
I've got it.

16:39.329 --> 16:40.887
You'd be Gandhi.

16:42.409 --> 16:43.842
I thought you'd be bigger.

16:45.209 --> 16:47.404
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.406
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

16:50.609 --> 16:51.837
I've come from India.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.485
I've read a great deal about you.

16:56.089 --> 16:57.568
Some of it good, I hope.

16:59.569 --> 17:00.888
Would you care to walk?

17:03.169 --> 17:04.807
You're a clergyman?

17:05.009 --> 17:06.839
I met some remarkable people in India.

17:07.049 --> 17:09.961
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

17:10.169 --> 17:12.000
- Does that surprise you?
- Not anymore.

17:12.329 --> 17:13.921
At first, I was amazed...

17:14.329 --> 17:16.718
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

17:16.929 --> 17:21.080
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

17:21.648 --> 17:24.083
Even when it's dangerous or...

17:27.049 --> 17:28.607
Hey, look what's coming!

17:28.889 --> 17:31.881
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

17:33.169 --> 17:34.602
Perhaps we should...

17:35.129 --> 17:36.323
Doesn't the New Testament say:

17:36.529 --> 17:39.839
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

17:40.049 --> 17:42.483
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord...

17:42.689 --> 17:43.883
I'm not so sure.

17:44.089 --> 17:46.444
I have thought about it a great deal.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.605
I suspect He meant
you must show courage...

17:49.049 --> 17:51.802
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

17:52.009 --> 17:54.569
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

17:54.769 --> 17:58.523
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

17:58.729 --> 18:02.199
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.600
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

18:06.049 --> 18:07.004
Good morning.

18:07.249 --> 18:09.479
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

18:09.729 --> 18:10.957
- Yeah, get off.
- Kaffir!

18:12.689 --> 18:14.122
Colin, what you doing?

18:14.369 --> 18:15.199
Nothing.

18:15.409 --> 18:17.206
Come out where I can see you!

18:21.369 --> 18:23.200
I said, what you doing?

18:23.689 --> 18:26.328
We were just trying
to clean up the neighbourhood.

18:26.529 --> 18:29.760
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 1 0 minutes ago.

18:30.129 --> 18:31.687
Get on!

18:37.369 --> 18:39.485
You'll find there's room for us all.

18:47.089 --> 18:49.444
- That was lucky.
- I thought you were a man of God.

18:49.649 --> 18:51.685
I am, but I'm not
so egotistical as to think...

18:51.889 --> 18:53.720
...He plans His day
around my dilemmas.

18:57.689 --> 18:59.805
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

19:00.009 --> 19:02.398
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.043
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

19:05.249 --> 19:08.321
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

19:08.769 --> 19:10.805
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

19:11.849 --> 19:12.884
Not always practised...

19:13.089 --> 19:16.320
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

19:16.569 --> 19:19.129
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

19:19.369 --> 19:20.722
Well, we shall try.

19:20.969 --> 19:22.721
Bad news, I'm afraid.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.523
They're going to change the pass laws.

19:29.889 --> 19:31.038
It's taken time...

19:31.409 --> 19:33.445
...but it needed to be done fairly.

19:34.209 --> 19:36.928
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

19:37.129 --> 19:39.597
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.284
Just one moment, sir, please.

19:44.569 --> 19:46.287
I beg your pardon.

19:48.049 --> 19:49.277
But on a short trip...

19:49.489 --> 19:53.243
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

19:53.529 --> 19:55.167
It's a tiny factor
in South Africa.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.606
Well, it is news at the moment.

19:59.809 --> 20:02.482
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

20:02.729 --> 20:05.004
...as well as the economy.
- Good.

20:05.209 --> 20:06.927
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

20:07.209 --> 20:08.608
Gandhi.

20:10.369 --> 20:12.883
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

20:13.089 --> 20:15.842
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

20:16.769 --> 20:18.839
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

20:19.089 --> 20:21.887
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

20:22.089 --> 20:24.649
...however otherworldly he may seem.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.643
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

20:27.849 --> 20:30.522
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

20:34.729 --> 20:37.323
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.562
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

20:41.769 --> 20:42.918
You see?

20:43.769 --> 20:45.407
Hindus, Muslims...

20:45.649 --> 20:47.446
...Sikhs, Jews...

20:48.209 --> 20:49.164
...even Christians.

20:49.729 --> 20:51.765
<i>Mr. Walker of the New York Times.</i>

20:51.969 --> 20:52.879
How you doing?

20:54.489 --> 20:57.526
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

20:57.729 --> 20:59.526
...you cannot unite a community.

20:59.769 --> 21:02.727
You belong to a
very important profession.

21:05.129 --> 21:08.519
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

21:08.729 --> 21:12.119
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

21:12.569 --> 21:14.048
I don't know.

21:14.289 --> 21:16.484
I'm still searching for a response.

21:16.729 --> 21:18.447
You will respect the law?

21:19.369 --> 21:23.806
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.088
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

21:27.289 --> 21:28.802
...not to mention the British Empire.

21:29.049 --> 21:32.280
If you are a minority of one...

21:32.649 --> 21:34.799
...the truth is the truth.

21:36.569 --> 21:37.797
Herman Kallenbach...

21:38.049 --> 21:40.882
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

21:41.089 --> 21:42.727
<i>Vince Walker, New York Times.</i>

21:42.969 --> 21:44.800
This is quite a place
you've got here.

21:45.529 --> 21:47.884
And you call it an ashram?

21:48.089 --> 21:50.887
That's right.
The word only means "community."

21:51.089 --> 21:54.240
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

21:54.489 --> 21:56.639
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

21:56.889 --> 21:58.481
I hope not.

22:01.249 --> 22:05.037
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

22:05.289 --> 22:07.883
- Is that part of the experiment?
- Ba!

22:09.169 --> 22:12.445
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

22:13.289 --> 22:14.768
I will tell Tara.

22:16.489 --> 22:20.243
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labour...

22:20.449 --> 22:22.121
...is as important as another's.

22:22.329 --> 22:24.445
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

22:24.689 --> 22:26.805
...seems far more important
than the law.

22:27.369 --> 22:28.927
Please, come and join us.

22:29.169 --> 22:31.808
You'll need something before
your journey back.

22:32.129 --> 22:35.087
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

22:44.769 --> 22:46.088
What is it?

22:47.129 --> 22:49.643
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

22:50.329 --> 22:52.001
...rake and cover the latrine.

22:52.249 --> 22:53.318
That's right.

22:53.649 --> 22:55.287
Everyone takes their turn.

22:55.569 --> 22:56.843
It is the work of untouchables!

22:57.129 --> 22:59.848
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

23:00.049 --> 23:01.880
...and no work is beneath any of us.

23:02.689 --> 23:03.758
I'm your wife!

23:04.009 --> 23:05.647
All the more reason.

23:08.369 --> 23:09.768
As you command.

23:12.489 --> 23:15.845
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

23:16.369 --> 23:18.405
...I knew you when you were a boy.

23:18.649 --> 23:20.128
It's not me.

23:21.049 --> 23:22.721
It's the principle.

23:23.049 --> 23:26.485
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.286
Not at all then.

23:33.129 --> 23:35.085
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

23:35.289 --> 23:38.964
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

23:39.769 --> 23:40.838
Have you no shame?

23:41.049 --> 23:42.448
I'm your wife!

23:54.049 --> 23:56.279
Where do you expect me to go?

23:57.929 --> 23:59.885
What's the matter with me?

24:07.449 --> 24:08.768
You're human.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.487
Only human.

24:14.849 --> 24:16.885
And it's even harder
for those of us...

24:17.089 --> 24:20.684
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

24:24.569 --> 24:25.968
I apologize.

24:31.969 --> 24:34.324
I must get back to that reporter.

24:35.929 --> 24:37.487
And I must...

24:38.289 --> 24:41.520
...rake and cover the latrine.

25:06.649 --> 25:08.640
I want to welcome you all.

25:10.169 --> 25:11.727
Every one of you.

25:12.329 --> 25:15.162
We have no secrets.

25:22.249 --> 25:24.888
Let us begin by being clear...

25:25.089 --> 25:27.728
...about General Smuts' new law.

25:28.769 --> 25:31.681
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

25:31.889 --> 25:32.799
...like criminals.

25:33.169 --> 25:34.727
Men and women.

25:34.969 --> 25:38.803
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

25:39.009 --> 25:40.488
Under this act...

25:40.929 --> 25:43.363
...our wives and mothers are whores.

25:44.089 --> 25:47.081
And every man here is a bastard.

25:51.369 --> 25:53.724
He has become quite good at this.

25:56.129 --> 25:58.324
And a policeman...

25:59.129 --> 26:01.689
...passing an Indian dwelling...

26:01.889 --> 26:03.686
...I will not call them homes...

26:03.929 --> 26:07.683
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

26:07.889 --> 26:09.800
Goddamn them!

26:11.169 --> 26:12.284
Understand...

26:13.289 --> 26:16.087
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

26:17.449 --> 26:18.598
He may enter.

26:18.849 --> 26:20.077
I will not allow it!

26:20.609 --> 26:22.964
I swear to Allah.

26:23.289 --> 26:27.487
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

26:28.009 --> 26:30.284
...and let them hang me!

26:33.929 --> 26:38.081
I say: Talk means nothing!

26:38.569 --> 26:42.687
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.359
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

26:46.609 --> 26:50.443
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

26:58.649 --> 27:01.163
I praise such courage.

27:01.369 --> 27:04.042
I need such courage...

27:04.249 --> 27:07.400
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

27:07.649 --> 27:09.048
But, my friend...

27:09.809 --> 27:14.200
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

27:15.289 --> 27:16.927
Whatever they do to us...

27:17.129 --> 27:19.040
...we will attack no one...

27:19.249 --> 27:21.126
...kill no one.

27:21.369 --> 27:25.044
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

27:25.849 --> 27:29.808
They will imprison us. They will fine
us. They will seize our possessions.

27:30.489 --> 27:33.162
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

27:33.369 --> 27:34.802
...if we do not give it to them.

27:35.009 --> 27:36.965
Have you been to prison?

27:37.649 --> 27:40.288
They beat us and torture us.
I say...

27:40.729 --> 27:43.448
I am asking you to fight.

27:44.289 --> 27:48.123
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

27:49.289 --> 27:53.043
We will not strike a blow.

27:53.929 --> 27:56.079
But we will receive them.

27:56.289 --> 27:57.722
And through our pain...

27:58.289 --> 28:01.201
...we will make them see
their injustice.

28:01.409 --> 28:03.001
And it will hurt...

28:03.569 --> 28:05.525
...as all fighting hurts.

28:07.089 --> 28:08.886
But we cannot lose.

28:09.649 --> 28:11.128
We cannot.

28:13.089 --> 28:15.205
They may torture my body...

28:15.889 --> 28:17.959
...break my bones...

28:18.169 --> 28:19.761
...even kill me.

28:20.129 --> 28:21.244
Then...

28:21.929 --> 28:24.204
...they will have my dead body...

28:25.129 --> 28:27.597
...not my obedience.

28:46.769 --> 28:49.567
We are Hindu and Muslim...

28:50.409 --> 28:53.003
...children of God, each one of us.

28:54.369 --> 28:57.805
Let us take a solemn oath
in His name...

28:58.569 --> 29:00.525
...that, come what may...

29:01.689 --> 29:04.886
...we will not submit to this law.

29:43.969 --> 29:48.724
<i>God save our gracious King</i>

29:48.929 --> 29:53.844
<i>God save our noble King</i>

29:54.329 --> 29:57.924
<i>God save our King</i>

30:56.369 --> 30:58.883
These men are contracted labourers.

30:59.089 --> 31:00.408
They belong in the mines.

31:00.649 --> 31:02.958
You put their comrades in jail.

31:03.169 --> 31:03.965
When you free them...

31:04.649 --> 31:06.401
...they will go back to work.

31:07.249 --> 31:08.568
I've warned you.

31:09.329 --> 31:10.762
We've warned each other.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.205
I don't think that's very good.

32:05.369 --> 32:07.519
Steady, steady.

32:07.769 --> 32:08.838
Stop!

32:19.489 --> 32:22.162
At the canter, charge!

32:24.929 --> 32:26.044
We should lie down.

32:26.289 --> 32:27.085
Down!

32:28.529 --> 32:30.918
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

33:08.369 --> 33:11.486
Follow me! Follow me!

33:30.969 --> 33:32.482
Now what the hell do we do?

33:32.809 --> 33:34.686
Let them march.

33:37.489 --> 33:40.720
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

33:41.089 --> 33:42.647
...we'll get them.

33:46.009 --> 33:46.964
One law!

33:47.169 --> 33:48.045
One king!

33:48.289 --> 33:49.278
One law!

33:49.489 --> 33:50.683
One king!

33:55.289 --> 33:59.168
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

34:00.409 --> 34:03.879
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

34:04.449 --> 34:07.885
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

34:08.129 --> 34:11.201
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

34:11.449 --> 34:14.088
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

34:15.728 --> 34:18.038
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

34:18.248 --> 34:20.809
...is ask questions about ourselves.

34:22.129 --> 34:26.007
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

34:27.649 --> 34:32.404
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

34:33.529 --> 34:35.246
...who will not fight...

34:35.929 --> 34:37.965
...but will not comply?

34:38.609 --> 34:41.362
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word...

34:55.049 --> 34:57.085
They're sparing no one, I see.

34:58.409 --> 35:01.128
No, you were the surprise.

35:01.409 --> 35:03.286
It has been all over the prison.

35:03.529 --> 35:05.759
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

35:05.969 --> 35:07.641
So did I.

35:16.609 --> 35:19.567
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

35:20.849 --> 35:21.838
Have they touched the women?

35:22.089 --> 35:26.207
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.

35:26.449 --> 35:28.246
It split the government.

35:28.449 --> 35:30.838
Well, that's one victory.

35:31.049 --> 35:34.439
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

35:34.649 --> 35:35.684
Don't worry.

35:35.929 --> 35:38.602
I've never seen men so determined.

35:38.849 --> 35:41.044
You have given them a way to fight.

35:46.049 --> 35:47.038
Gandhi!

35:47.729 --> 35:49.003
I want Gandhi!

35:49.249 --> 35:51.080
Which Sammy is it?

36:30.809 --> 36:32.083
Mr. Gandhi.

36:33.769 --> 36:35.999
I thought we might have
a little talk.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.008
Thank you, Daniels.

36:42.129 --> 36:44.040
Will you have a glass of sherry?

36:44.809 --> 36:46.128
Thank you, no.

36:46.489 --> 36:47.444
Perhaps some tea?

36:47.769 --> 36:49.487
I dined at the prison.

36:53.969 --> 36:56.437
Please, do come and sit down.

37:11.849 --> 37:15.239
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

37:15.449 --> 37:17.838
...that you have taken
such exception to.

37:18.169 --> 37:22.447
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

37:22.889 --> 37:24.845
It's not quite that simple.

37:25.049 --> 37:27.040
Somehow, I expected not.

37:27.289 --> 37:29.928
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

37:30.169 --> 37:32.239
...to investigate the new legislation.

37:33.049 --> 37:36.325
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

37:36.969 --> 37:38.448
I congratulate them.

37:38.649 --> 37:40.162
But they might also recommend...

37:41.169 --> 37:44.525
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

37:45.289 --> 37:46.847
...even stopped.

37:54.809 --> 37:58.848
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

37:59.049 --> 38:02.246
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we...

38:03.809 --> 38:06.164
We are in a position of advantage.

38:12.929 --> 38:16.205
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

38:17.289 --> 38:19.883
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

38:28.129 --> 38:29.562
Assuming we are in agreement.

38:30.329 --> 38:31.887
Yes, yes.

38:32.129 --> 38:36.486
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

38:36.769 --> 38:37.804
All right. Fine.

38:40.009 --> 38:41.488
I'm afraid I have no money.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.083
Neither have I.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.440
I'm awfully sorry.

38:49.009 --> 38:49.805
Daniels...

38:50.049 --> 38:53.041
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

38:53.889 --> 38:55.242
I beg your pardon, sir?

38:56.289 --> 38:58.245
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

38:58.489 --> 39:02.846
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

39:03.649 --> 39:06.766
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

39:14.849 --> 39:15.998
Thank you.

39:21.289 --> 39:23.564
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

39:23.809 --> 39:26.277
...but I can find my own way out.

39:42.809 --> 39:44.083
Guard of honour!

39:45.769 --> 39:46.884
Guard of honour!

39:47.129 --> 39:48.847
Attention!

40:01.369 --> 40:03.758
Present arms!

40:09.009 --> 40:11.648
- My God, he loves it!
- I'm sure he hates it.

40:12.089 --> 40:14.967
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

40:15.169 --> 40:16.761
...fighting on the Western front.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.803
Not as military governors in India.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.488
What the devil's going on back there?

40:24.529 --> 40:27.282
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

40:27.529 --> 40:29.360
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

40:30.649 --> 40:31.843
There he is.

40:34.409 --> 40:36.479
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

40:36.929 --> 40:38.203
I thought he was a lawyer.

40:38.529 --> 40:41.839
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

40:42.089 --> 40:43.602
No, I haven't refused.

40:43.849 --> 40:46.807
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

40:47.049 --> 40:48.687
Will you support the war effort?

40:48.889 --> 40:53.519
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

40:53.769 --> 40:57.125
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defence.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.445
Now that you're back in India,
what will you do?

40:59.689 --> 41:00.917
I don't know.

41:01.169 --> 41:02.841
- I don't know.
- One more question.

41:03.089 --> 41:06.638
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

41:06.889 --> 41:09.767
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.237
Thank you very much.

41:17.929 --> 41:20.489
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

41:20.729 --> 41:21.798
May I?

41:32.809 --> 41:34.481
I'm glad to be home...

41:39.809 --> 41:41.640
...and I thank you for your greeting.

41:59.729 --> 42:00.957
I'll follow with your wife.

42:01.209 --> 42:02.847
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

42:06.889 --> 42:07.799
Who's that young man?

42:08.049 --> 42:09.277
That's young Nehru.

42:09.489 --> 42:11.957
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

42:12.209 --> 42:13.562
...and the devil's own charm.

42:13.809 --> 42:17.199
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge...
Wave, wave!

42:17.929 --> 42:19.282
He might amount to something.

42:24.569 --> 42:29.245
I must say, when I first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

42:29.489 --> 42:31.605
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

42:31.929 --> 42:33.647
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

42:33.929 --> 42:35.442
Yes, you are!

42:35.649 --> 42:38.447
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

42:38.689 --> 42:40.839
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

42:41.049 --> 42:45.565
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

43:09.409 --> 43:13.448
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

43:13.729 --> 43:15.845
Too bad you came back third class.

43:16.049 --> 43:17.448
He might have been impressed...

43:17.689 --> 43:20.999
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

43:22.489 --> 43:23.842
Yes, I'm sure.

43:34.329 --> 43:36.763
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

43:37.489 --> 43:41.038
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

43:41.289 --> 43:43.484
...and revolution to my son.

43:43.769 --> 43:47.478
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

43:47.769 --> 43:49.646
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League...

43:49.889 --> 43:51.163
How do you do?

43:51.409 --> 43:53.445
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

43:53.649 --> 43:56.846
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

43:57.849 --> 44:00.317
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

44:00.569 --> 44:01.718
I have simply written...

44:01.929 --> 44:05.126
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

44:05.369 --> 44:07.200
...it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

44:07.449 --> 44:09.883
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

44:10.329 --> 44:13.605
It's a clever argument. It may not
produce the end you desire.

44:13.849 --> 44:18.001
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

44:18.209 --> 44:22.088
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

44:22.329 --> 44:23.318
Excuse me.

44:25.529 --> 44:27.008
Sorry to rush you.

44:28.329 --> 44:30.763
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

44:30.969 --> 44:32.607
That's nonviolence for you.

44:34.329 --> 44:35.239
You know, Mohan...

44:35.809 --> 44:37.879
...now I have a confession to make.

44:38.329 --> 44:40.718
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

44:40.929 --> 44:42.840
Professor Gokhale sent me.

44:44.529 --> 44:46.804
We are trying
to make a nation, Gandhi.

44:47.049 --> 44:49.609
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

44:49.889 --> 44:53.404
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

44:54.209 --> 44:56.598
What you were writing
in South Africa...

44:56.889 --> 44:58.288
...that's what we need here.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.645
I have so much to learn about India.

45:00.849 --> 45:04.637
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

45:04.889 --> 45:08.086
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

45:08.529 --> 45:11.123
We want none of you imperialists here.

45:11.889 --> 45:14.961
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

45:15.289 --> 45:17.519
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

45:17.809 --> 45:19.561
...and convert her to Christianity.

45:20.009 --> 45:22.443
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

45:23.929 --> 45:26.397
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

45:27.529 --> 45:30.202
Now, you forget about your practice.

45:30.529 --> 45:32.406
You have other things to do.

45:33.329 --> 45:36.639
India has many men
with too much wealth.

45:37.049 --> 45:40.837
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

45:41.089 --> 45:44.764
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

45:45.209 --> 45:46.608
I'll see to it.

45:46.929 --> 45:48.328
You begin your journal.

45:48.649 --> 45:49.764
I have little to say.

45:50.129 --> 45:51.767
Come, let's sit down.

45:52.009 --> 45:53.920
India is an alien country to me.

45:54.289 --> 45:55.483
Change that.

45:56.489 --> 45:58.798
Go and find India.

45:59.049 --> 46:00.368
Not what you see here...

46:00.569 --> 46:03.037
...but the real India.

46:03.609 --> 46:05.998
You'll see what needs to be said...

46:06.649 --> 46:08.879
...what we need to hear.

46:15.089 --> 46:17.398
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

46:19.449 --> 46:22.122
I knew I could die in peace.

46:23.489 --> 46:26.162
Make India proud of herself.

49:44.689 --> 49:47.044
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

49:47.249 --> 49:50.207
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

49:50.449 --> 49:52.838
Please! Come in.

49:53.449 --> 49:54.768
No violence, please.

49:55.009 --> 49:58.160
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

49:58.409 --> 49:59.637
Englishman, sahib!

50:00.049 --> 50:01.687
Come, there is room up here!

50:04.529 --> 50:05.644
Put your foot on the window.

50:05.889 --> 50:07.117
Come!

50:13.689 --> 50:16.840
- What are you doing?
- I'm going nearer to God.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.648
Charlie! Be careful!

50:21.089 --> 50:22.966
Let go. Let go!

50:23.969 --> 50:25.402
- Let go!
- Oh, dear!

50:37.689 --> 50:38.519
Hello.

50:40.609 --> 50:43.282
You see?
It is most comfortable.

50:43.529 --> 50:44.848
Sahib?

50:46.009 --> 50:46.998
Are you a Christian?

50:47.849 --> 50:49.362
Yes, I'm a Christian.

50:49.609 --> 50:51.088
I know a Christian.

50:51.809 --> 50:53.640
She drinks blood.

50:54.809 --> 50:56.765
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.

51:01.129 --> 51:01.925
Charlie!

51:06.329 --> 51:08.240
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

51:09.009 --> 51:10.237
Bend!

51:13.649 --> 51:17.403
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

51:18.249 --> 51:20.240
I agree with Jinnah.

51:20.729 --> 51:24.278
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

51:24.529 --> 51:26.838
The Germans are worn out as it is.

51:27.329 --> 51:29.285
And our first act should be...

51:29.929 --> 51:32.443
...to convene
a congress party convention...

51:32.929 --> 51:35.045
...and demand independence.

51:35.289 --> 51:38.326
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

51:40.129 --> 51:41.562
And we should invite Gandhi.

51:41.809 --> 51:43.481
What the devil's happened to him?

51:44.049 --> 51:45.767
He's discovering India.

51:45.969 --> 51:48.608
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

51:48.849 --> 51:51.682
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

51:51.929 --> 51:53.999
...then let him slip into oblivion.

52:22.969 --> 52:24.084
Insurgents.

52:24.369 --> 52:25.927
They've derailed a troop train.

52:27.569 --> 52:29.207
Keep clear!
Come on.

52:35.049 --> 52:37.244
They've killed an English soldier.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.482
<i>We were asked for toleration.</i>

52:47.969 --> 52:50.642
We were asked for patience.

52:50.969 --> 52:52.721
Some of us gave it...

52:52.969 --> 52:55.005
...and some did not.

52:56.369 --> 52:58.724
Their war is over.

52:59.649 --> 53:02.004
And those of us who supported it...

53:02.249 --> 53:04.638
...and those of us who refused...

53:04.889 --> 53:08.086
...must forget our differences.

53:08.569 --> 53:11.481
And there can be no excuses...

53:11.689 --> 53:13.884
...from the British now.

53:14.129 --> 53:15.926
India wants...

53:16.129 --> 53:17.482
...home rule.

53:17.729 --> 53:18.764
India...

53:19.009 --> 53:20.920
...demands home rule!

53:36.729 --> 53:38.367
Congratulations.

53:48.569 --> 53:50.924
And let no one question...

53:51.129 --> 53:53.040
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

53:53.289 --> 53:55.359
...not just for the Muslims...

53:55.609 --> 53:56.598
...but for all India!

54:03.369 --> 54:04.688
And now...

54:04.889 --> 54:07.119
...l'm going to introduce to you...

54:07.329 --> 54:09.206
...a man whose writings...

54:09.449 --> 54:11.440
...we are all becoming familiar with.

54:11.649 --> 54:15.608
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

54:15.849 --> 54:20.081
A man whose accomplishments in
South Africa will always be remembered.

54:20.369 --> 54:22.280
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

54:24.369 --> 54:26.360
Your journal has made great impact.

54:26.569 --> 54:28.799
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

54:29.049 --> 54:31.961
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

54:32.209 --> 54:33.358
But it is true.

54:33.609 --> 54:35.884
I read it. Often!

54:47.329 --> 54:50.685
Since I returned from South Africa...

54:52.649 --> 54:55.402
...l've travelled over much of India.

54:56.129 --> 54:59.963
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

55:00.249 --> 55:03.286
...and still only see
a small part of her.

55:03.969 --> 55:06.039
And yet, I already know...

55:06.329 --> 55:08.081
...that what we say here...

55:08.329 --> 55:11.958
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

55:12.569 --> 55:15.959
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

55:16.689 --> 55:20.568
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

55:23.169 --> 55:25.046
But the people of India...

55:25.289 --> 55:26.517
...are...

55:27.209 --> 55:28.437
...untouched.

55:29.369 --> 55:32.406
Their politics are confined to bread...

55:32.729 --> 55:34.003
...and salt.

55:34.489 --> 55:36.525
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

55:36.769 --> 55:39.886
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

55:40.169 --> 55:43.127
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

55:43.329 --> 55:45.081
...in the name of freedom.

55:46.729 --> 55:49.448
This congress tells the world...

55:49.649 --> 55:51.719
...it represents India.

55:52.769 --> 55:53.997
My brothers...

55:54.449 --> 55:55.484
...lndia...

55:55.689 --> 55:59.045
...is 700,000 villages...

56:00.409 --> 56:02.047
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

56:03.089 --> 56:04.602
...and Bombay.

56:05.289 --> 56:07.883
Until we stand in the fields...

56:08.089 --> 56:11.843
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

56:12.689 --> 56:15.726
...we will not represent India.

56:15.929 --> 56:19.478
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

56:20.049 --> 56:21.687
...as one nation.

56:38.249 --> 56:39.762
Have you read his magazine?

56:40.369 --> 56:41.438
No.

56:42.169 --> 56:43.682
But I think I'm going to.

56:48.089 --> 56:49.488
Pull over.

56:49.689 --> 56:51.202
This can't be the way.

56:51.489 --> 56:54.959
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

56:56.129 --> 56:58.802
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

56:59.009 --> 57:01.000
...when all this was awaiting me.

57:19.449 --> 57:21.121
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

57:24.089 --> 57:26.523
- You'll find him under that tree.
- Thank you.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.844
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

57:30.289 --> 57:33.326
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

57:33.569 --> 57:35.525
It's stupid, of course.

57:35.769 --> 57:37.248
Because in our country...

57:37.449 --> 57:39.883
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

57:40.729 --> 57:42.879
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

57:43.089 --> 57:44.807
And from their luxury...

57:45.049 --> 57:48.644
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

57:49.529 --> 57:52.999
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

57:53.249 --> 57:57.083
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

57:57.329 --> 58:00.048
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

58:00.289 --> 58:01.881
...while greedily assimilating...

58:02.089 --> 58:05.764
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

58:08.969 --> 58:10.607
If we have home rule...

58:11.329 --> 58:12.364
...that'll change.

58:16.329 --> 58:17.159
Would you, please?

58:19.169 --> 58:21.683
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

58:23.569 --> 58:26.037
We must take
the peelings to the goats.

58:26.609 --> 58:30.841
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

58:31.329 --> 58:32.648
We've bred an army of anarchists...

58:32.849 --> 58:36.080
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

58:36.329 --> 58:38.126
Hello! Hello!

58:38.369 --> 58:40.121
But I thought you were
against fighting.

58:40.369 --> 58:43.406
Now just spread it around.

58:43.609 --> 58:45.088
There you are.

58:45.449 --> 58:48.964
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

58:51.049 --> 58:54.041
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

58:54.849 --> 58:58.444
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

58:58.649 --> 59:02.324
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

59:02.569 --> 59:05.083
And if we really want
to change things...

59:05.689 --> 59:07.725
...there are better ways
of doing it...

59:07.969 --> 59:11.200
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

59:11.409 --> 59:13.081
The fire is ready.

59:14.209 --> 59:16.200
You see, even here...

59:17.369 --> 59:19.087
...we live under tyranny.

59:25.369 --> 59:28.008
What did I tell you?
Look at him!

59:28.689 --> 59:30.998
I can see the British shaking now.

59:47.849 --> 59:49.521
Hello!

59:49.769 --> 59:52.488
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

59:54.569 --> 59:57.925
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

01:00:00.169 --> 01:00:01.682
Our crops.

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:03.601
We cannot sell them.

01:00:04.889 --> 01:00:06.208
We have no money.

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:09.408
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

01:00:10.929 --> 01:00:13.284
We have nothing left.

01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:57.288
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!

01:01:09.089 --> 01:01:10.317
Jesus!

01:01:11.449 --> 01:01:13.201
What the hell is going on?

01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:15.481
I don't know, sir.

01:01:20.289 --> 01:01:21.688
The agent got a telegram.

01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:25.484
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

01:01:31.049 --> 01:01:33.279
Who the hell is "he"?

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:35.359
I don't know, sir.

01:01:58.729 --> 01:02:00.526
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:09.202
- Who the devil are you?
- My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

01:02:09.409 --> 01:02:11.127
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

01:02:11.889 --> 01:02:14.244
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:16.328
They seem to want me.

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:17.558
Now, look here.

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:19.640
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:21.764
On what charge?

01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:27.482
I don't want any trouble.

01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:32.126
I'm an Indian travelling in my own
country. I see no reason for trouble.

01:02:34.649 --> 01:02:36.685
Well, there had better not be.

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.686
Make way for the officer.

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:02.887
For years...

01:03:03.409 --> 01:03:05.525
...the landlords have ordered us...

01:03:05.729 --> 01:03:07.003
...to grow indigo...

01:03:07.689 --> 01:03:09.122
...for dyeing cloth.

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:13.678
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

01:03:14.649 --> 01:03:15.684
But now...

01:03:16.249 --> 01:03:20.128
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.478
So no one wants...

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:24.085
...our indigo.

01:03:24.649 --> 01:03:25.684
The landlords...

01:03:26.009 --> 01:03:28.648
...say we must pay our rent...

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.242
...in cash.

01:03:32.129 --> 01:03:33.482
What we could...

01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:35.487
...we sold.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.402
The police have taken the rest.

01:03:39.209 --> 01:03:40.085
There is...

01:03:40.409 --> 01:03:42.479
...no food.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:45.485
I understand.

01:03:47.849 --> 01:03:49.168
The landlords are British?

01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.080
What we can do, we will try to do.

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:21.444
Shukla...

01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:24.079
...is all Champaran like this?

01:04:24.729 --> 01:04:26.128
Yes, Bapu.

01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:28.041
The whole region.

01:04:28.529 --> 01:04:29.644
Hundreds.

01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:30.725
Thousands.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.599
Some landlords have tried to help.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.886
But what can they do?

01:04:52.169 --> 01:04:54.842
- Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
- Yes.

01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:57.005
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

01:04:57.849 --> 01:04:59.168
I'm not sorry at all.

01:05:09.129 --> 01:05:11.484
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

01:05:14.769 --> 01:05:16.202
Oh, no!

01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:25.884
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

01:05:26.169 --> 01:05:27.727
India's full of grief, old man.

01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:28.885
I've got no idea.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:32.724
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

01:05:32.969 --> 01:05:34.118
The whole company's ordered out.

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:53.007
I would like to see the prisoner.

01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:06.082
On the left, sir.

01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:17.122
Shades of South Africa.

01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:18.404
Not quite.

01:06:18.769 --> 01:06:20.282
They're only holding me...

01:06:20.489 --> 01:06:22.525
...until the magistrate's hearing.

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:24.680
Then it will be prison.

01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:28.927
Did they take your clothes?

01:06:30.489 --> 01:06:32.081
These are my clothes now.

01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:36.961
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:39.441
If I want to be one with them...

01:06:39.849 --> 01:06:41.328
...I have to live like them.

01:06:41.529 --> 01:06:42.803
Yes, I think you do.

01:06:43.889 --> 01:06:45.959
But thank God we all don't.

01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:48.086
My puritanism runs in a different way.

01:06:48.329 --> 01:06:50.206
I'm far too modest for such a display.

01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:59.287
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

01:07:12.369 --> 01:07:13.802
They're calling you "Bapu."

01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:15.647
I thought it meant "father."

01:07:16.289 --> 01:07:17.688
It does.

01:07:18.649 --> 01:07:20.605
We must be getting old, Charlie.

01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:24.968
What do you want me to do?

01:07:28.369 --> 01:07:30.007
I think that you can help us most...

01:07:30.209 --> 01:07:33.485
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:38.366
I have to be sure...

01:07:38.969 --> 01:07:40.925
They have to be sure
that what we do...

01:07:41.129 --> 01:07:44.246
...can be done by Indians alone.

01:07:55.569 --> 01:07:57.082
But you know the strategy.

01:07:57.289 --> 01:08:00.440
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

01:08:00.729 --> 01:08:02.321
It is their strength that we need.

01:08:02.529 --> 01:08:03.848
Before you go...

01:08:04.729 --> 01:08:07.880
...you could start us
in the right direction.

01:08:17.169 --> 01:08:19.000
I must leave from Calcutta...

01:08:20.089 --> 01:08:21.680
...and soon.

01:08:24.328 --> 01:08:25.921
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:31.684
Well, I...

01:08:33.368 --> 01:08:35.724
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:39.687
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.560
I'm going to clear the courtroom.

01:09:01.889 --> 01:09:03.082
I'm not sure we'd be able to.

01:09:03.288 --> 01:09:05.519
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

01:09:05.769 --> 01:09:07.487
And he's a lawyer.

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.287
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:13.447
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

01:09:13.769 --> 01:09:15.999
How did the press get here
before the military?

01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:18.889
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

01:09:19.129 --> 01:09:22.279
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

01:09:35.169 --> 01:09:36.966
You have been ordered
out of the province...

01:09:37.209 --> 01:09:39.643
...on the grounds
of disturbing the peace.

01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:48.080
With respect, I refuse to go.

01:09:50.849 --> 01:09:53.124
Do you want to go to jail?

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:54.518
As you wish.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:00.639
All right.

01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:03.521
I will release you on bail...

01:10:03.769 --> 01:10:07.478
...of 1 00 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:12.405
I refuse to pay 1 00 rupees.

01:10:22.369 --> 01:10:24.246
Then I will grant release on bail...

01:10:24.489 --> 01:10:28.084
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

01:10:53.289 --> 01:10:54.358
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:01.843
We are from Bihar.

01:11:02.369 --> 01:11:04.485
We received a cable
from an old friend...

01:11:04.689 --> 01:11:06.327
...who was at Cambridge with us.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:07.803
His name is Nehru.

01:11:08.049 --> 01:11:10.005
- I believe you know him.
- Indeed.

01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:13.520
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

01:11:15.489 --> 01:11:19.880
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:21.397
It may take months.

01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:23.128
We have no pressing engagements.

01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:25.883
You will have to live
with the peasants.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.087
There will be risks.

01:11:46.289 --> 01:11:48.086
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

01:11:48.329 --> 01:11:49.318
But good God, man!

01:11:49.569 --> 01:11:53.198
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

01:11:54.329 --> 01:11:57.560
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

01:11:57.809 --> 01:11:59.765
...demanding services without pay.

01:12:00.009 --> 01:12:02.239
Even refusing them water.

01:12:02.769 --> 01:12:04.122
In India!

01:12:04.369 --> 01:12:06.803
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:09.080
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:10.842
...into an international hero.

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:15.762
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

01:12:16.009 --> 01:12:19.319
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:22.686
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

01:12:24.369 --> 01:12:26.883
What do they want?

01:12:27.129 --> 01:12:28.278
Gareth!

01:12:29.649 --> 01:12:30.877
Yes, sir.

01:12:31.129 --> 01:12:33.199
There's a rebate on rents paid.

01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:36.004
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

01:12:36.489 --> 01:12:40.482
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:46.607
That would satisfy him?

01:12:47.089 --> 01:12:48.522
And His Majesty's government.

01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:51.803
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:02.879
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:07.682
Thank you, sir.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:11.608
- We're too damned liberal.
- Perhaps.

01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:16.488
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:20.165
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

01:13:34.489 --> 01:13:36.286
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

01:13:36.969 --> 01:13:39.199
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:43.078
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

01:13:43.569 --> 01:13:45.480
He came third class.

01:13:46.329 --> 01:13:48.889
God, give me patience.

01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:55.401
My house is honoured.

01:13:55.649 --> 01:13:57.128
The honour is ours.

01:13:57.329 --> 01:13:59.923
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:04.088
He's interested in flowers. I told
him he could wander your garden.

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:07.402
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

01:14:07.649 --> 01:14:09.082
Thank you.

01:14:12.969 --> 01:14:15.403
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:17.879
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

01:14:18.129 --> 01:14:20.120
Mr. Patel you know.

01:14:20.369 --> 01:14:22.837
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

01:14:23.049 --> 01:14:25.768
...and just recently
released from prison.

01:14:27.569 --> 01:14:28.888
Mr. Kripalani.

01:14:29.969 --> 01:14:33.086
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:36.079
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

01:14:36.329 --> 01:14:38.320
Please sit down. Do sit down.

01:14:38.569 --> 01:14:42.767
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

01:14:42.969 --> 01:14:45.688
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

01:14:45.889 --> 01:14:47.959
And it is exactly as was rumoured.

01:14:48.369 --> 01:14:51.566
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

01:14:51.769 --> 01:14:54.237
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:57.846
And your writings
are specifically listed.

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.280
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

01:15:00.489 --> 01:15:03.959
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.881
...they can never handle.

01:15:06.849 --> 01:15:08.248
I don't think so.

01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:12.079
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

01:15:12.929 --> 01:15:15.284
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

01:15:16.569 --> 01:15:19.208
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:22.361
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

01:15:22.609 --> 01:15:26.079
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:28.564
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

01:15:28.769 --> 01:15:30.805
I must say, it seems to me...

01:15:31.049 --> 01:15:35.679
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:37.723
If I may...

01:15:37.929 --> 01:15:41.285
...l, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:44.559
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.

01:15:44.809 --> 01:15:47.039
We must never submit to such laws...

01:15:47.489 --> 01:15:48.683
...ever.

01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:54.598
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:57.758
May I?

01:15:59.969 --> 01:16:03.518
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:06.488
Thank you.

01:16:09.769 --> 01:16:11.282
All of them.

01:16:11.929 --> 01:16:14.079
- Forgive my stupid illustration.
- Allow me.

01:16:14.329 --> 01:16:15.921
No, please.

01:16:16.129 --> 01:16:18.165
But I want to change their minds...

01:16:18.369 --> 01:16:21.679
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

01:16:24.369 --> 01:16:26.644
And what resistance would you offer?

01:16:27.369 --> 01:16:30.884
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.961
I want to call upon the nation...

01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:36.838
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

01:16:37.089 --> 01:16:38.124
A general strike?

01:16:39.489 --> 01:16:42.003
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:45.559
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

01:16:46.529 --> 01:16:47.723
No trains.

01:16:47.969 --> 01:16:49.322
No factories.

01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:50.479
No administration.

01:16:52.249 --> 01:16:53.887
The country would stop.

01:16:55.289 --> 01:16:57.723
My God, it would terrify them!

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:00.639
350 million people at prayer?

01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:03.923
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

01:17:04.289 --> 01:17:05.881
...and explain why.

01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:08.563
- But could we get people to do it?
- Why not?

01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:11.679
Champaran stirred the whole country.

01:17:13.049 --> 01:17:14.687
Thank you.

01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:17.000
They're calling you "Mahatma."

01:17:17.889 --> 01:17:19.288
"Great Soul."

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:24.282
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:29.328
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

01:17:29.569 --> 01:17:30.718
...all of congress...

01:17:31.289 --> 01:17:32.961
...every avenue we know...

01:17:33.289 --> 01:17:37.487
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:50.687
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

01:17:50.889 --> 01:17:53.642
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

01:17:53.849 --> 01:17:56.602
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

01:17:59.769 --> 01:18:03.398
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

01:18:10.129 --> 01:18:11.482
Mr. Kinnoch.

01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:14.046
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

01:18:15.089 --> 01:18:16.317
Nothing's working, sir.

01:18:16.569 --> 01:18:19.129
The buses, the trains, the markets.

01:18:19.489 --> 01:18:22.128
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

01:18:22.449 --> 01:18:24.804
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

01:18:25.049 --> 01:18:28.121
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

01:18:28.569 --> 01:18:30.287
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

01:18:32.529 --> 01:18:34.121
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

01:18:39.769 --> 01:18:41.327
I can't believe it.

01:18:41.529 --> 01:18:43.997
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

01:18:44.249 --> 01:18:47.480
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

01:18:48.289 --> 01:18:49.119
Arrest him.

01:18:56.169 --> 01:18:58.478
He's to go to the visitors' room.

01:19:16.049 --> 01:19:17.164
Bapu.

01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:19.682
You too?

01:19:20.969 --> 01:19:23.881
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

01:19:31.929 --> 01:19:35.126
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

01:19:35.769 --> 01:19:38.078
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

01:19:38.329 --> 01:19:39.762
I run to stop them.

01:19:40.489 --> 01:19:44.482
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

01:19:45.569 --> 01:19:49.084
But some English civilians
have been killed.

01:19:51.969 --> 01:19:54.802
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

01:19:56.649 --> 01:19:58.207
Sometimes worse.

01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:05.680
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:08.599
Maybe we're not ready yet.

01:20:09.769 --> 01:20:12.078
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

01:20:17.169 --> 01:20:20.286
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

01:20:20.969 --> 01:20:23.483
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

01:20:23.969 --> 01:20:28.121
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

01:20:30.969 --> 01:20:33.642
I've never spoken for anything else.

01:20:58.489 --> 01:20:59.717
England...

01:21:00.049 --> 01:21:01.641
...is so powerful.

01:21:02.489 --> 01:21:03.638
Its army...

01:21:03.849 --> 01:21:04.998
...and its navy...

01:21:05.769 --> 01:21:07.680
...all its modern weapons...

01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:10.805
But when a great power like that...

01:21:11.729 --> 01:21:13.720
...strikes defenceless people...

01:21:14.489 --> 01:21:17.242
...it shows its brutality...

01:21:17.489 --> 01:21:18.478
...its own weakness.

01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:21.448
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

01:21:49.249 --> 01:21:51.319
Fighting back will not work.

01:21:51.569 --> 01:21:53.685
And that is why the Mahatma...

01:21:54.529 --> 01:21:57.327
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

01:22:27.249 --> 01:22:29.888
Back away! Back away!

01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:40.682
But if we riot...

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.802
...if we fight back...

01:22:44.569 --> 01:22:46.082
...we become the vandals...

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:47.682
...and they become the law.

01:22:48.729 --> 01:22:53.086
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

01:22:54.289 --> 01:22:56.564
God and His law are on our...

01:23:25.649 --> 01:23:28.083
Front rank, kneel in position!

01:23:31.249 --> 01:23:32.682
We...

01:23:33.089 --> 01:23:35.319
...must have the courage...

01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:37.685
...to take their anger.

01:23:50.369 --> 01:23:52.121
Should we issue a warning, sir?

01:23:54.369 --> 01:23:56.087
They've had their warning:

01:23:56.889 --> 01:23:58.481
No meetings.

01:24:02.369 --> 01:24:03.165
Fire!

01:24:34.609 --> 01:24:36.645
Take your time!

01:24:57.489 --> 01:24:58.604
Corporal!

01:24:59.009 --> 01:25:00.328
To your left.

01:25:46.889 --> 01:25:48.288
General Dyer...

01:25:49.409 --> 01:25:52.048
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

01:25:52.249 --> 01:25:54.524
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

01:25:55.089 --> 01:25:56.807
That is so.

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:04.367
1 51 6 casualties with...

01:26:05.889 --> 01:26:09.279
...1 650 bullets.

01:26:09.689 --> 01:26:11.281
My intention was
to inflict a lesson...

01:26:11.489 --> 01:26:14.447
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

01:26:19.569 --> 01:26:20.638
General...

01:26:22.049 --> 01:26:25.837
...had you been able to
take in the armoured car...

01:26:26.449 --> 01:26:28.804
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:34.488
I think, probably, yes.

01:26:37.849 --> 01:26:41.967
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

01:26:43.289 --> 01:26:44.642
I did.

01:26:45.569 --> 01:26:48.163
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

01:26:48.409 --> 01:26:49.967
That is correct.

01:26:56.289 --> 01:26:59.998
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

01:27:03.769 --> 01:27:06.078
I was ready to help any who applied.

01:27:08.369 --> 01:27:11.008
General, how does a child...

01:27:11.489 --> 01:27:13.923
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.799
...apply for help?

01:30:53.489 --> 01:30:56.799
<i>Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...</i>

01:30:57.369 --> 01:31:01.840
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:06.207
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:07.968
Now...

01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:10.080
...what I would like to do...

01:31:10.489 --> 01:31:14.721
...is to come to some compromise
over the new...

01:31:14.929 --> 01:31:17.318
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

01:31:17.569 --> 01:31:20.606
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.801
We think it is time you recognized...

01:31:23.049 --> 01:31:26.007
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

01:31:28.009 --> 01:31:30.125
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

01:31:30.329 --> 01:31:34.208
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:38.997
General Dyer is but an extreme
example of the principle.

01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:41.601
It is time you left.

01:31:45.769 --> 01:31:47.919
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

01:31:48.209 --> 01:31:50.200
...without British administration...

01:31:50.409 --> 01:31:52.365
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

01:31:52.689 --> 01:31:53.917
Mr. Kinnoch...

01:31:56.009 --> 01:31:58.079
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

01:31:58.329 --> 01:32:00.638
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.044
...to the good government
of an alien power.

01:32:03.249 --> 01:32:05.922
My dear sir, India is British.

01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:08.364
We're hardly an alien power.

01:32:15.489 --> 01:32:20.244
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

01:32:20.489 --> 01:32:24.402
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:26.640
...who are a minority in this realm.

01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:30.120
And experience suggests
that his troops...

01:32:30.369 --> 01:32:33.805
...and his administration
are essential...

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:36.483
...in order to secure the peace.

01:32:37.289 --> 01:32:40.486
All nations contain
religious minorities.

01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:43.681
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

01:32:43.969 --> 01:32:45.561
But they will be ours...

01:32:45.929 --> 01:32:47.044
...not yours.

01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:50.160
How do you propose
to make them yours?

01:32:51.209 --> 01:32:53.564
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India.

01:32:54.289 --> 01:32:55.085
Yes.

01:32:56.249 --> 01:32:57.079
In the end...

01:32:57.329 --> 01:32:58.728
...you will walk out...

01:32:59.209 --> 01:33:02.599
...because 1 00,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

01:33:02.809 --> 01:33:05.403
...350 million Indians
if those Indians refuse...

01:33:05.649 --> 01:33:07.207
...to cooperate.

01:33:07.409 --> 01:33:09.764
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

01:33:10.009 --> 01:33:14.127
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

01:33:15.329 --> 01:33:17.889
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

01:33:18.609 --> 01:33:19.962
...Your Excellency.

01:33:22.809 --> 01:33:25.562
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

01:33:25.769 --> 01:33:27.566
And he said, "Yes."

01:33:27.929 --> 01:33:30.397
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

01:33:30.609 --> 01:33:32.759
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

01:33:32.969 --> 01:33:35.847
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually going to do something.

01:33:36.089 --> 01:33:40.446
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

01:33:40.849 --> 01:33:43.363
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

01:33:43.569 --> 01:33:46.879
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

01:33:47.409 --> 01:33:49.479
Whatever mischief he causes...

01:33:49.689 --> 01:33:52.601
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

01:33:56.489 --> 01:33:59.208
But now something worse is happening.

01:33:59.409 --> 01:34:01.604
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

01:34:02.249 --> 01:34:04.968
...women wove their own cloth.

01:34:06.009 --> 01:34:08.762
But now there are millions
who have no work...

01:34:09.489 --> 01:34:14.199
...because those who can,
buy all they need from England.

01:34:15.409 --> 01:34:17.525
I say with Gandhiji:

01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:21.127
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

01:34:21.369 --> 01:34:25.203
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

01:34:55.169 --> 01:34:57.160
My message to you...

01:34:58.009 --> 01:35:01.399
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

01:35:02.249 --> 01:35:04.479
To gain independence...

01:35:04.889 --> 01:35:06.766
...we must prove worthy of it.

01:35:08.089 --> 01:35:12.799
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

01:35:18.089 --> 01:35:18.885
Second:

01:35:20.049 --> 01:35:23.439
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:25.964
We must remove untouchability...

01:35:26.169 --> 01:35:28.922
...from our hearts and from our lives.

01:35:34.289 --> 01:35:35.563
Third:

01:35:36.249 --> 01:35:38.809
We must defy the British.

01:35:55.089 --> 01:35:59.162
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

01:36:00.369 --> 01:36:03.645
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

01:36:04.249 --> 01:36:06.763
English factories make the cloth...

01:36:07.249 --> 01:36:09.365
...that makes our poverty.

01:36:10.089 --> 01:36:12.967
All those who wish to
make the English see...

01:36:13.529 --> 01:36:17.841
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

01:36:18.289 --> 01:36:20.962
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.608
...and in London.

01:36:24.089 --> 01:36:25.238
And if...

01:36:25.929 --> 01:36:27.328
...like me...

01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:31.086
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

01:36:33.889 --> 01:36:36.005
...wear it with dignity.

01:37:17.449 --> 01:37:19.360
Thank you very much.

01:37:20.009 --> 01:37:21.965
No, thank you, I can manage.

01:37:23.649 --> 01:37:25.287
Don't destroy my good intentions.

01:37:25.529 --> 01:37:27.440
I'm already feeling guilty
about travelling second class.

01:37:27.689 --> 01:37:29.486
You've earned a few indulgences.

01:37:29.729 --> 01:37:32.243
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

01:37:32.489 --> 01:37:34.047
Our trains met in Bombay.

01:37:34.249 --> 01:37:37.241
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

01:37:37.489 --> 01:37:39.286
There's another passenger.

01:37:39.569 --> 01:37:43.164
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

01:37:43.449 --> 01:37:45.679
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

01:37:47.489 --> 01:37:49.241
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

01:37:49.449 --> 01:37:51.041
...proposes to do in our ashram?

01:37:51.249 --> 01:37:54.161
- Sink us?
- From the looks of the luggage, yes.

01:37:54.449 --> 01:37:57.839
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

01:37:58.089 --> 01:37:59.602
Miss Slade!

01:38:00.289 --> 01:38:01.802
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

01:38:02.609 --> 01:38:05.123
And you would be Miss Slade?

01:38:05.489 --> 01:38:07.844
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:09.277
Mirabehn.

01:38:15.009 --> 01:38:18.797
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

01:38:25.289 --> 01:38:28.406
Leave it. Leave it.

01:38:28.689 --> 01:38:30.645
God gave you 1 0 thumbs.

01:38:30.889 --> 01:38:32.004
Eleven.

01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:37.807
Sardar!

01:38:43.649 --> 01:38:45.287
Mirabehn!

01:38:51.609 --> 01:38:53.201
Come, come.

01:38:54.849 --> 01:38:56.999
You will be my daughter.

01:38:58.889 --> 01:39:00.322
But then...

01:39:00.569 --> 01:39:02.560
...some rioting broke out...

01:39:02.769 --> 01:39:05.488
...between Hindus and Muslims.

01:39:06.369 --> 01:39:08.803
Violent, terrible.

01:39:10.249 --> 01:39:11.921
Whether it was provoked...

01:39:12.409 --> 01:39:14.206
...I don't know.

01:39:15.009 --> 01:39:18.763
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

01:39:20.449 --> 01:39:22.883
Some of the things
the military have done...

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:25.205
Is the campaign weakening?

01:39:25.489 --> 01:39:28.447
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

01:39:28.649 --> 01:39:30.480
But with the censorship here...

01:39:31.209 --> 01:39:32.437
...they know more in England...

01:39:33.049 --> 01:39:34.801
...than we do.

01:39:35.009 --> 01:39:38.206
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

01:39:39.089 --> 01:39:40.602
They are not alone.

01:39:41.089 --> 01:39:45.128
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:51.399
Is that homespun?

01:39:52.849 --> 01:39:54.999
I sent for it from here.

01:39:55.369 --> 01:39:56.245
I dyed it myself.

01:40:00.489 --> 01:40:02.559
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

01:40:02.969 --> 01:40:04.482
It must have produced hardship.

01:40:04.689 --> 01:40:06.008
It has...

01:40:06.249 --> 01:40:08.843
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

01:40:09.049 --> 01:40:10.198
Good.

01:40:13.209 --> 01:40:15.439
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

01:40:15.689 --> 01:40:17.600
- I'd rather march.
- First, spin!

01:40:19.089 --> 01:40:21.398
Let the others march for a time.

01:40:22.289 --> 01:40:24.849
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

01:40:25.089 --> 01:40:26.761
And you must teach me yours.

01:40:34.889 --> 01:40:38.564
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

01:40:45.129 --> 01:40:48.917
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

01:41:02.049 --> 01:41:05.883
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

01:41:12.369 --> 01:41:14.405
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

01:41:16.089 --> 01:41:17.602
Help us!

01:41:17.969 --> 01:41:20.039
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

01:41:20.609 --> 01:41:22.327
Go on your way. On your way!

01:41:23.289 --> 01:41:24.244
Come back!

01:41:26.569 --> 01:41:28.525
Help us! Help us!

01:41:31.089 --> 01:41:32.886
Help! Help!

01:43:00.489 --> 01:43:02.798
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

01:43:06.289 --> 01:43:08.439
Now it's all over the world.

01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:11.487
India's "nonviolence."

01:43:13.489 --> 01:43:15.002
What can we do?

01:43:15.569 --> 01:43:17.207
We must end the campaign.

01:43:20.409 --> 01:43:23.845
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

01:43:24.089 --> 01:43:28.480
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:31.278
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

01:43:31.489 --> 01:43:33.764
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

01:43:33.969 --> 01:43:36.802
The whole of India is on the move!

01:43:37.009 --> 01:43:39.159
Yes, but in what direction?

01:43:39.449 --> 01:43:43.158
If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed, I want no part of it.

01:43:46.689 --> 01:43:49.203
You are the father of the nation.

01:43:49.449 --> 01:43:52.441
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

01:43:55.489 --> 01:43:57.923
This was one incident.

01:43:58.169 --> 01:44:00.922
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

01:44:06.969 --> 01:44:09.722
The whole nation is marching.

01:44:10.089 --> 01:44:13.081
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

01:44:15.489 --> 01:44:17.207
I will ask.

01:44:17.809 --> 01:44:22.087
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.803
And I will not stop until they stop.

01:44:26.569 --> 01:44:27.604
But...

01:44:28.009 --> 01:44:31.001
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

01:44:31.209 --> 01:44:33.200
They'll put it on every street corner.

01:44:35.809 --> 01:44:38.164
People are aroused.

01:44:38.369 --> 01:44:40.041
They won't stop!

01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:44.522
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

01:45:22.289 --> 01:45:25.042
I must get ready for morning prayers.

01:45:25.289 --> 01:45:27.200
Mirabehn is here.

01:46:11.889 --> 01:46:14.005
I've brought your drinking water.

01:46:26.289 --> 01:46:29.361
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

01:46:41.649 --> 01:46:44.607
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

01:46:45.169 --> 01:46:46.887
There was a telegram.

01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:50.042
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

01:46:50.449 --> 01:46:52.201
When it is everywhere...

01:46:53.609 --> 01:46:56.169
...then my prayers will be answered.

01:46:59.969 --> 01:47:02.005
Do you find me stubborn?

01:47:02.809 --> 01:47:04.003
I don't know.

01:47:04.969 --> 01:47:07.005
I know that you are right.

01:47:07.449 --> 01:47:09.804
I don't know that this is right.

01:47:12.289 --> 01:47:14.007
May I turn you?

01:47:27.049 --> 01:47:29.085
When I despair...

01:47:29.569 --> 01:47:32.925
...I remember that
all through history...

01:47:33.769 --> 01:47:37.808
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

01:47:39.689 --> 01:47:42.487
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:46.648
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

01:47:46.849 --> 01:47:49.886
But in the end, they always fall.

01:47:51.489 --> 01:47:52.842
Think of it.

01:47:54.369 --> 01:47:56.007
Always.

01:47:57.849 --> 01:48:01.159
Whenever you are in doubt that
that is God's way...

01:48:01.369 --> 01:48:04.202
...the way the world is meant to be...

01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:05.888
...think of that...

01:48:07.249 --> 01:48:10.400
...and then try to do it His way.

01:48:13.449 --> 01:48:17.806
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

01:48:21.569 --> 01:48:23.002
Panditji!

01:48:35.369 --> 01:48:36.245
Jinnah...

01:48:37.089 --> 01:48:38.204
...Patel...

01:48:38.769 --> 01:48:42.728
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

01:48:42.969 --> 01:48:46.484
There's not been one demonstration.

01:48:47.449 --> 01:48:52.000
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

01:48:52.449 --> 01:48:53.962
They're walking in the streets...

01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:56.808
...offering garlands to the police...

01:48:58.809 --> 01:49:00.162
...and British soldiers.

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:05.199
Perhaps I have overdone it.

01:49:25.569 --> 01:49:28.083
- Good morning, Bapu.
- Good morning.

01:49:28.369 --> 01:49:31.486
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

01:49:31.689 --> 01:49:33.520
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

01:50:01.169 --> 01:50:02.727
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:04.408
...but you're under arrest.

01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:06.321
On what charge?

01:50:06.569 --> 01:50:07.888
Sedition.

01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:10.200
You can't be serious.

01:50:10.569 --> 01:50:12.207
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

01:50:12.449 --> 01:50:13.598
That's as may be.

01:50:13.849 --> 01:50:15.646
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

01:50:15.889 --> 01:50:17.242
I don't believe it!

01:50:17.489 --> 01:50:19.764
Even the British can't be that stupid.

01:50:20.649 --> 01:50:21.479
Help me, please.

01:50:22.529 --> 01:50:25.282
Mira, you must look after Ba.

01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:33.648
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

01:50:33.849 --> 01:50:35.202
...I will fast again.

01:50:35.529 --> 01:50:36.678
Herman.

01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:39.165
I have been on many trips.

01:50:39.729 --> 01:50:40.525
Monda.

01:50:41.569 --> 01:50:43.446
This is just another trip.

01:50:44.289 --> 01:50:46.086
I am at your command.

01:50:51.449 --> 01:50:54.521
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

01:50:54.729 --> 01:50:57.766
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

01:50:57.969 --> 01:51:00.119
...our country can make at this time.

01:51:01.089 --> 01:51:05.719
And if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

01:51:13.569 --> 01:51:15.639
Call the prisoner to the bar.

01:51:59.769 --> 01:52:02.567
"Noncooperation has one aim:

01:52:02.769 --> 01:52:04.885
The overthrow of the government.

01:52:05.169 --> 01:52:07.478
Sedition must become our creed.

01:52:08.049 --> 01:52:09.880
We must give no quarter...

01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:12.882
...nor can we expect any."

01:52:13.089 --> 01:52:15.239
- Do you deny writing it?
- Not at all.

01:52:16.169 --> 01:52:18.000
And I will save the court's time...

01:52:18.249 --> 01:52:20.638
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

01:52:20.889 --> 01:52:23.084
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

01:52:23.289 --> 01:52:25.484
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

01:52:26.489 --> 01:52:28.957
The prosecution rests, my lord.

01:52:32.929 --> 01:52:35.397
I presume you are conducting
your own defence.

01:52:36.729 --> 01:52:39.289
I have no defence, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

01:52:39.889 --> 01:52:42.084
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

01:52:42.329 --> 01:52:46.845
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

01:52:57.569 --> 01:53:01.118
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:04.207
...from any person
I have ever tried...

01:53:05.009 --> 01:53:07.000
...or am likely to try.

01:53:07.489 --> 01:53:09.878
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

01:53:10.089 --> 01:53:13.718
...to six years' imprisonment.

01:53:23.569 --> 01:53:27.403
lf, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:31.041
...see fit to reduce the term...

01:53:33.289 --> 01:53:36.087
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:04.884
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped:

01:54:05.169 --> 01:54:08.286
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

01:54:08.929 --> 01:54:10.920
Maybe they could even subdue him.

01:54:11.769 --> 01:54:13.680
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

01:54:13.889 --> 01:54:16.244
And as soon as he got out,
he was back, tramping the countryside...

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:19.885
...preaching nonviolence and
demanding a free India.

01:54:21.249 --> 01:54:24.082
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

01:54:25.769 --> 01:54:28.237
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

01:54:28.449 --> 01:54:31.088
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

01:54:31.449 --> 01:54:33.201
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

01:54:33.409 --> 01:54:35.320
He certainly makes good copy.

01:54:35.649 --> 01:54:40.086
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

01:54:41.729 --> 01:54:42.878
I met him once.

01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:44.721
- What, you mean Gandhi?
- Yeah.

01:54:44.969 --> 01:54:47.164
South Africa, a long time ago.

01:54:47.649 --> 01:54:49.480
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:50.718
What was he like?

01:54:50.969 --> 01:54:53.085
He had a full head of hair then.

01:54:53.489 --> 01:54:56.287
We were a bit like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:59.208
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

01:55:05.449 --> 01:55:09.124
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.280
Helpmate.

01:55:12.369 --> 01:55:16.840
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

01:55:18.089 --> 01:55:20.444
I will ever live devoted to you...

01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:25.080
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

01:55:26.369 --> 01:55:28.599
Take the fifth step...

01:55:28.849 --> 01:55:30.521
...the walking around a fire...

01:55:33.049 --> 01:55:36.007
...that we may serve the people.

01:55:36.249 --> 01:55:38.809
I will follow close behind you...

01:55:39.009 --> 01:55:41.477
...and help to serve the people.

01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:44.926
Take the sixth step...

01:55:46.089 --> 01:55:49.479
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

01:55:49.849 --> 01:55:54.081
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

01:55:55.169 --> 01:55:57.205
Take the seventh step...

01:55:59.969 --> 01:56:02.927
...that we may ever
live as friends.

01:56:04.969 --> 01:56:07.483
You are my best friend...

01:56:08.569 --> 01:56:10.480
...my highest guru...

01:56:11.369 --> 01:56:13.678
...and my sovereign lord.

01:56:17.649 --> 01:56:20.527
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

01:56:20.769 --> 01:56:23.203
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

01:56:23.449 --> 01:56:25.883
And with that, we were pronounced...

01:56:26.169 --> 01:56:27.682
...man and wife.

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:32.283
We were both 1 3.

01:56:44.129 --> 01:56:45.687
It's beautiful.

01:56:47.169 --> 01:56:49.046
Even as a boy...

01:56:49.249 --> 01:56:50.682
...I thought so.

01:56:52.649 --> 01:56:54.082
Thank you.

01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:58.280
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

01:57:00.089 --> 01:57:03.638
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

01:57:04.929 --> 01:57:05.839
Is it?

01:57:06.569 --> 01:57:07.888
Perhaps.

01:57:08.769 --> 01:57:10.646
I've come here to think about it.

01:57:14.289 --> 01:57:16.280
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

01:57:16.489 --> 01:57:18.878
Oh, yes. A great deal.

01:57:21.169 --> 01:57:22.966
I've travelled so far...

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:25.685
...and thought so much.

01:57:29.729 --> 01:57:33.688
As you can see,
my city is a sea city.

01:57:34.969 --> 01:57:37.199
Always full of Hindus...

01:57:37.409 --> 01:57:38.888
...Muslims...

01:57:39.089 --> 01:57:41.205
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

01:57:43.569 --> 01:57:46.481
My family's sect was the Pranami.

01:57:46.889 --> 01:57:48.117
Hindu, of course.

01:57:48.329 --> 01:57:51.446
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:53.799
...from the Muslim Koran...

01:57:54.009 --> 01:57:56.728
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

01:57:56.929 --> 01:57:59.363
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

01:57:59.569 --> 01:58:01.366
...as long as God was worshipped.

01:58:04.929 --> 01:58:06.123
When I was a boy...

01:58:06.689 --> 01:58:08.725
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

01:58:12.089 --> 01:58:16.207
<i>A true disciple
Knows another's woes</i>

01:58:16.409 --> 01:58:18.525
<i>As his own</i>

01:58:19.009 --> 01:58:20.158
He bows to all...

01:58:20.369 --> 01:58:22.485
...and despises none.

01:58:23.729 --> 01:58:24.844
Like all other boys...

01:58:25.049 --> 01:58:26.528
...I sang the words...

01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:31.082
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

01:58:34.529 --> 01:58:36.485
I've travelled so far.

01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:40.084
And all I've done is come back...

01:58:40.849 --> 01:58:42.077
...home.

01:58:51.889 --> 01:58:52.685
Wait a minute.

01:58:54.249 --> 01:58:55.728
You know what you're going to do,
don't you?

01:58:55.969 --> 01:58:57.288
It would have been uncivil of me...

01:58:57.489 --> 01:59:00.128
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

01:59:02.249 --> 01:59:04.080
- Where are you going?
- Come.

01:59:05.849 --> 01:59:07.999
- Where are we going?
- Back to the ashram.

01:59:08.249 --> 01:59:10.126
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

01:59:10.369 --> 01:59:13.167
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in India.

01:59:13.489 --> 01:59:14.478
Salt?

01:59:14.689 --> 01:59:18.477
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

01:59:20.489 --> 01:59:23.720
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

01:59:23.929 --> 01:59:28.286
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:30.845
All right, he's breaking the law.

01:59:31.089 --> 01:59:34.240
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

01:59:34.449 --> 01:59:35.928
It's not a serious attack
on the revenue.

01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:38.967
Its primary importance is symbolic.

01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:41.239
Don't patronize me, Charles.

01:59:45.369 --> 01:59:48.520
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

01:59:48.769 --> 01:59:52.682
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

01:59:53.489 --> 01:59:57.084
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

01:59:57.289 --> 01:59:58.483
The day he sets off...

01:59:58.729 --> 02:00:02.563
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

02:00:03.249 --> 02:00:07.765
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

02:00:11.849 --> 02:00:13.805
I say ignore it.

02:00:14.049 --> 02:00:16.404
Let them raise their damned flags.

02:00:16.649 --> 02:00:17.559
Let him make his salt.

02:00:18.729 --> 02:00:21.687
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

02:00:23.969 --> 02:00:25.561
He'll arrive at the sea...

02:00:25.769 --> 02:00:28.761
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

02:00:37.529 --> 02:00:39.918
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.

02:00:40.329 --> 02:00:43.048
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

02:00:43.289 --> 02:00:46.918
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

02:01:38.969 --> 02:01:41.722
You've done me a great service.

02:01:41.969 --> 02:01:43.118
Not at all, sir.

02:01:43.369 --> 02:01:47.282
It would be uncivil of us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

02:02:01.569 --> 02:02:02.718
We'll go.

02:02:02.969 --> 02:02:06.405
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

02:02:28.089 --> 02:02:29.886
Is it over if they arrest you now?

02:02:30.089 --> 02:02:31.158
Not if they arrest me...

02:02:31.409 --> 02:02:33.718
...or 1 000 or 1 0,000.

02:02:33.969 --> 02:02:37.723
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

02:02:38.369 --> 02:02:40.883
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

02:02:41.129 --> 02:02:42.357
Something for your notebook:

02:02:42.769 --> 02:02:46.000
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

02:02:46.289 --> 02:02:47.927
And we will continue to provoke...

02:02:48.129 --> 02:02:51.326
...until they respond
or they change the law.

02:02:51.569 --> 02:02:54.561
They are not in control.
We are.

02:02:55.169 --> 02:02:58.081
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

02:03:02.569 --> 02:03:03.888
Vince!

02:03:04.769 --> 02:03:08.239
- What did he say?
- He said he's in control.

02:03:29.329 --> 02:03:31.285
Do you intend to walk all the way?

02:03:31.529 --> 02:03:33.724
It's the only way
I can get the story.

02:03:33.969 --> 02:03:36.278
Besides, my name is Walker.

02:03:36.889 --> 02:03:39.084
"My name is Walker."

02:04:31.049 --> 02:04:33.688
My dear Mrs. Nehru!

02:05:25.929 --> 02:05:27.840
Man needs salt...

02:05:28.049 --> 02:05:30.609
...as he needs air and water.

02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:34.917
This salt comes
from the Indian Ocean.

02:05:35.169 --> 02:05:38.878
Let every Indian claim it
as his right.

02:05:40.369 --> 02:05:43.122
<i>And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...</i>

02:05:43.369 --> 02:05:46.486
<i>... has challenged the might
of the British Empire.</i>

02:06:01.169 --> 02:06:04.002
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

02:06:04.249 --> 02:06:05.318
Publicly.

02:06:05.569 --> 02:06:08.766
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

02:06:09.289 --> 02:06:10.608
We're being made fools of, sir...

02:06:10.849 --> 02:06:12.202
...around the world.

02:06:12.449 --> 02:06:14.519
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

02:06:14.769 --> 02:06:18.000
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

02:06:18.249 --> 02:06:20.558
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

02:06:21.569 --> 02:06:24.288
Arrest anyone, any rank,
except Gandhi.

02:06:25.329 --> 02:06:27.445
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

02:06:28.569 --> 02:06:31.766
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

02:06:48.569 --> 02:06:51.037
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!

02:07:25.089 --> 02:07:25.965
Don't hit back!

02:07:26.209 --> 02:07:27.688
No violence!

02:07:37.409 --> 02:07:41.527
There must be 1 00,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

02:07:41.769 --> 02:07:44.727
- Who's leading them?
- I don't know. Nehru, Patel...

02:07:44.929 --> 02:07:48.968
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

02:07:49.209 --> 02:07:51.882
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

02:07:54.129 --> 02:07:56.006
Has there been any violence?

02:07:56.249 --> 02:07:58.968
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

02:07:59.169 --> 02:08:02.286
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

02:08:03.449 --> 02:08:06.327
But he's facing disciplinary court.

02:08:06.569 --> 02:08:08.605
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

02:08:08.809 --> 02:08:13.280
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

02:08:15.969 --> 02:08:17.084
No, sir.

02:08:17.329 --> 02:08:19.285
I'm afraid not.

02:08:19.569 --> 02:08:23.278
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might...

02:08:26.449 --> 02:08:28.917
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

02:08:29.129 --> 02:08:30.244
Yes, sir, he has.

02:08:30.489 --> 02:08:31.604
The usual thing:

02:08:31.809 --> 02:08:33.925
"India's salt belongs to India."

02:08:34.169 --> 02:08:35.124
Then he says flatly...

02:08:35.369 --> 02:08:39.521
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

02:08:40.769 --> 02:08:42.521
Thank him for his letter...

02:08:42.929 --> 02:08:44.681
...and put him in jail.

02:08:46.369 --> 02:08:47.165
Yes, sir.

02:08:49.769 --> 02:08:51.327
It'll be my pleasure.

02:08:51.569 --> 02:08:53.719
- And Fields?
- Sir?

02:08:53.969 --> 02:08:56.278
Keep that salt works open.

02:08:56.569 --> 02:08:58.287
Yes, sir.

02:09:03.649 --> 02:09:04.638
I'm sorry, sir.

02:09:04.849 --> 02:09:08.159
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

02:09:08.369 --> 02:09:09.688
Very well.

02:09:11.649 --> 02:09:12.923
...in his name.

02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:17.725
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

02:09:17.969 --> 02:09:21.006
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

02:09:23.169 --> 02:09:25.080
Long live Gandhiji!

02:09:28.769 --> 02:09:30.487
We are ready!

02:09:37.329 --> 02:09:39.320
I want firmness and discipline.

02:09:58.729 --> 02:10:01.482
- All right, take up your positions.
- Yes, sir.

02:10:08.129 --> 02:10:10.324
To your mark. Forward!

02:10:20.569 --> 02:10:22.605
Last night at midnight...

02:10:23.369 --> 02:10:24.927
...they took Gandhiji from us.

02:10:26.369 --> 02:10:28.599
They expect us to lose heart...

02:10:28.809 --> 02:10:30.447
...or to fight back.

02:10:31.169 --> 02:10:33.239
We will do neither!

02:11:03.369 --> 02:11:04.688
On your guard!

02:11:20.849 --> 02:11:22.328
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

02:12:38.329 --> 02:12:39.478
<i>"They walked...</i>

02:12:40.009 --> 02:12:41.965
<i>... both Hindu and Muslim alike...</i>

02:12:42.929 --> 02:12:44.806
<i>... with heads held high...</i>

02:12:45.249 --> 02:12:47.046
<i>... without any hope of escape...</i>

02:12:47.529 --> 02:12:49.247
<i>... from injury or death.</i>

02:12:49.529 --> 02:12:52.680
It went on and on into the night."

02:12:52.889 --> 02:12:53.844
Stop.

02:12:54.049 --> 02:12:58.122
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

02:12:58.329 --> 02:13:00.718
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

02:13:00.929 --> 02:13:01.805
Stop.

02:13:02.009 --> 02:13:05.365
"But still, it went on and on.

02:13:07.089 --> 02:13:11.605
Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

02:13:11.809 --> 02:13:13.606
...was lost here today.

02:13:14.369 --> 02:13:16.360
<i>India is free...</i>

02:13:16.569 --> 02:13:21.245
<i>... for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...</i>

02:13:21.449 --> 02:13:25.408
<i>... and she has neither
cringed nor retreated. "</i>

02:14:32.969 --> 02:14:37.360
I am aware that I must have given
you much cause for irritation...

02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:38.797
...Your Excellency.

02:14:39.049 --> 02:14:41.927
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

02:14:46.289 --> 02:14:47.438
Mr. Gandhi...

02:14:48.169 --> 02:14:51.366
...I am instructed to request
your attendance...

02:14:51.569 --> 02:14:53.719
...at an all-government
conference in London...

02:14:54.649 --> 02:14:59.325
...to discuss the possible
independence...

02:14:59.529 --> 02:15:00.928
...of India.

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:13.644
<i>Only recently released from prison...</i>

02:15:13.849 --> 02:15:17.637
<i>... Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...</i>

02:15:17.849 --> 02:15:20.568
<i>... to attend the conference
on Indian independence...</i>

02:15:20.809 --> 02:15:24.882
<i>... called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.</i>

02:15:25.969 --> 02:15:28.881
<i>Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...</i>

02:15:29.129 --> 02:15:31.484
<i>... is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...</i>

02:15:31.689 --> 02:15:33.281
<i>... for the duration of the talks.</i>

02:15:33.729 --> 02:15:35.845
<i>He's seen here
amongst local cockneys...</i>

02:15:36.049 --> 02:15:37.926
<i>... who have taken him
to their hearts.</i>

02:15:38.169 --> 02:15:39.761
<i>Besides attending the conference...</i>

02:15:39.969 --> 02:15:42.802
<i>... he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...</i>

02:15:43.009 --> 02:15:44.886
<i>... like Mr. Lloyd George...</i>

02:15:45.129 --> 02:15:48.201
<i>... the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...</i>

02:15:48.409 --> 02:15:50.206
<i>... and Charlie Chaplin.</i>

02:15:52.569 --> 02:15:54.844
<i>He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...</i>

02:15:55.049 --> 02:15:59.122
<i>... to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...</i>

02:15:59.329 --> 02:16:02.639
<i>... at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.</i>

02:16:02.889 --> 02:16:06.279
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

02:16:06.489 --> 02:16:10.528
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

02:16:11.289 --> 02:16:12.642
...but several.

02:16:13.369 --> 02:16:15.200
A Hindu India...

02:16:15.449 --> 02:16:17.565
...a Muslim India...

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:20.237
...and an India of princely states.

02:16:20.489 --> 02:16:23.208
And all these must be respected...

02:16:23.409 --> 02:16:24.922
...and cared for.

02:16:25.169 --> 02:16:26.488
Not just one.

02:16:50.648 --> 02:16:52.401
<i>Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...</i>

02:16:52.648 --> 02:16:55.607
<i>... the London Round Table Conference
on Indian Independence...</i>

02:16:55.808 --> 02:16:58.323
<i>... journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.</i>

02:16:58.849 --> 02:17:01.204
<i>Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...</i>

02:17:01.409 --> 02:17:04.162
<i>... Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...</i>

02:17:05.049 --> 02:17:06.528
<i>... before heading back south...</i>

02:17:06.769 --> 02:17:09.236
<i>... for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.</i>

02:17:09.689 --> 02:17:14.318
<i>The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.</i>

02:17:17.289 --> 02:17:19.564
<i>So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.</i>

02:17:20.049 --> 02:17:22.279
<i>And bon voyage!</i>

02:17:24.249 --> 02:17:26.603
<i>So the truth is,
after all your travels...</i>

02:17:26.808 --> 02:17:28.401
<i>... after all your efforts...</i>

02:17:28.648 --> 02:17:32.358
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

02:17:32.769 --> 02:17:35.920
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:38.888
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

02:17:39.568 --> 02:17:41.287
But the will has gone.

02:17:41.529 --> 02:17:44.441
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

02:17:44.648 --> 02:17:47.117
The only question is, when and how.

02:17:47.489 --> 02:17:49.207
Well, I say, when is now!

02:17:51.369 --> 02:17:53.644
And we will determine how.

02:17:53.888 --> 02:17:55.481
Precisely.

02:17:55.888 --> 02:17:57.799
Bapu, she is limping again.

02:17:58.289 --> 02:17:59.642
It's only a sprain.

02:18:00.089 --> 02:18:03.320
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

02:18:04.568 --> 02:18:07.129
Go. I won't be a moment.

02:18:10.568 --> 02:18:12.480
They are preparing for war.

02:18:13.289 --> 02:18:14.517
I will not support it.

02:18:14.728 --> 02:18:18.404
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

02:18:18.648 --> 02:18:20.924
That's when you take advantage.

02:18:21.249 --> 02:18:23.968
That is just another way
of hitting back.

02:18:25.169 --> 02:18:27.205
We've come a long way together
with the British.

02:18:27.409 --> 02:18:30.287
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

02:18:30.529 --> 02:18:35.284
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

02:18:41.289 --> 02:18:42.404
Mud packs.

02:18:54.289 --> 02:18:56.120
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

02:18:56.329 --> 02:18:59.843
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:03.085
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

02:19:05.049 --> 02:19:08.519
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:10.682
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

02:19:10.888 --> 02:19:11.878
Corporal!

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:17.843
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

02:19:18.089 --> 02:19:21.398
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

02:19:22.129 --> 02:19:25.644
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

02:19:50.169 --> 02:19:51.887
Hold it a second, will you?

02:19:53.449 --> 02:19:56.327
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

02:19:56.569 --> 02:19:59.402
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

02:20:00.249 --> 02:20:03.605
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

02:20:05.329 --> 02:20:06.921
Not bad for a prison, eh?

02:20:07.129 --> 02:20:09.518
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

02:20:09.729 --> 02:20:11.685
Your timing's pretty lucky.

02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:13.806
They had him cut off from the press.

02:20:14.009 --> 02:20:17.638
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

02:20:22.569 --> 02:20:25.367
<i>Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.</i>

02:20:25.609 --> 02:20:29.397
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

02:20:29.649 --> 02:20:33.403
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

02:20:33.609 --> 02:20:35.964
...sitting alone in prison...

02:20:36.209 --> 02:20:39.519
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

02:20:40.329 --> 02:20:43.878
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

02:20:46.049 --> 02:20:49.758
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

02:20:55.449 --> 02:20:59.203
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

02:20:59.529 --> 02:21:02.999
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

02:21:03.249 --> 02:21:05.319
...independence will come.

02:21:05.649 --> 02:21:06.718
My only worry...

02:21:06.929 --> 02:21:09.284
...is what shape it will take.

02:21:09.529 --> 02:21:11.201
- Jinnah has...
- Stop!

02:21:11.729 --> 02:21:14.926
I'm sorry, but...
Could you come forward, please?

02:21:15.569 --> 02:21:17.685
- Come, come.
- Just up to the railing.

02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:19.442
Thank you very much.

02:21:21.769 --> 02:21:23.088
Now, sorry.

02:21:23.289 --> 02:21:25.405
Go on. "What shape it will take..."

02:21:25.609 --> 02:21:27.042
Jinnah has what?

02:21:28.649 --> 02:21:32.119
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

02:21:32.329 --> 02:21:36.368
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

02:21:36.609 --> 02:21:39.043
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

02:21:39.289 --> 02:21:41.359
...of what will happen to them...

02:21:41.569 --> 02:21:44.402
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

02:21:45.089 --> 02:21:47.887
And that I find hard to bear...

02:21:48.129 --> 02:21:49.721
...even in prison.

02:21:49.929 --> 02:21:51.567
Mr. Gandhi?

02:21:57.369 --> 02:22:01.760
It's hard for me to see this as a
cure for the 20th century's problems.

02:22:02.489 --> 02:22:04.957
I have friends who keep telling me...

02:22:05.169 --> 02:22:08.957
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

02:22:10.649 --> 02:22:15.120
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

02:22:15.369 --> 02:22:16.927
...even 20th century things.

02:22:17.169 --> 02:22:21.640
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

02:22:22.609 --> 02:22:25.407
India lives in her villages...

02:22:25.649 --> 02:22:28.402
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

02:22:28.609 --> 02:22:31.840
...if their local skills
can be revived.

02:22:32.249 --> 02:22:35.127
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

02:22:35.849 --> 02:22:38.158
And a constructive program
is the only...

02:22:38.369 --> 02:22:41.520
...nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

02:22:42.209 --> 02:22:44.769
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

02:22:44.969 --> 02:22:49.087
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

02:22:51.609 --> 02:22:54.999
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

02:22:56.929 --> 02:23:00.046
Not without defeats and great pain.

02:23:01.209 --> 02:23:03.769
But are there no defeats in this war?

02:23:04.449 --> 02:23:05.325
No pain?

02:23:07.049 --> 02:23:08.482
What you cannot do...

02:23:08.729 --> 02:23:11.289
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

02:23:11.489 --> 02:23:14.481
You must make the injustice visible.

02:23:14.689 --> 02:23:18.159
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

02:23:21.449 --> 02:23:24.122
Is this what I'm meant to
end up with here?

02:23:25.569 --> 02:23:27.560
That's what you get
for distracting me.

02:23:27.769 --> 02:23:29.760
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

02:23:29.969 --> 02:23:34.360
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

02:23:35.249 --> 02:23:38.400
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

02:23:43.649 --> 02:23:46.322
And that includes the life of women.

02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:49.642
Bapu has always said...

02:23:49.849 --> 02:23:52.568
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

02:23:52.969 --> 02:23:56.564
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

02:23:57.089 --> 02:24:00.240
And he has always fought against both.

02:24:02.849 --> 02:24:05.966
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

02:24:09.449 --> 02:24:11.599
In Hindu philosophy...

02:24:12.409 --> 02:24:13.808
...the way to God...

02:24:14.009 --> 02:24:16.648
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

02:24:17.569 --> 02:24:18.922
...and of passions.

02:24:19.809 --> 02:24:24.007
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

02:24:27.609 --> 02:24:31.602
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

02:24:34.129 --> 02:24:36.723
Four times he tried...

02:24:37.449 --> 02:24:38.848
...and failed.

02:24:40.529 --> 02:24:42.440
But then he took a solemn vow.

02:24:45.169 --> 02:24:46.318
And he's never broken it?

02:24:49.729 --> 02:24:50.844
Not yet.

02:25:08.049 --> 02:25:11.246
- I've got permission to move her.
- I'm very sorry, sir.

02:25:11.449 --> 02:25:14.168
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

02:25:14.409 --> 02:25:15.922
She'll never survive the trip.

02:25:16.129 --> 02:25:18.962
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

02:26:04.569 --> 02:26:07.288
It's time for my walk.

02:26:09.609 --> 02:26:11.122
I won't be long.

02:28:23.449 --> 02:28:24.245
Guard...

02:28:24.689 --> 02:28:26.645
...present arms!

02:28:41.849 --> 02:28:45.683
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

02:28:47.729 --> 02:28:50.801
To assist at the birth of
an independent India...

02:28:51.049 --> 02:28:52.482
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

02:28:52.689 --> 02:28:54.998
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

02:28:56.249 --> 02:28:59.127
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

02:28:59.329 --> 02:29:03.004
...ever to have the honour
of such a reception.

02:29:14.969 --> 02:29:17.608
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

02:29:17.849 --> 02:29:19.965
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

02:29:20.209 --> 02:29:22.200
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

02:29:22.449 --> 02:29:24.917
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

02:29:25.129 --> 02:29:27.324
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

02:29:33.569 --> 02:29:37.448
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

02:29:38.009 --> 02:29:40.682
No one will be master, no one slave.

02:29:40.929 --> 02:29:43.124
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.

02:29:43.369 --> 02:29:44.961
I'm talking about the real world.

02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:46.722
- How the...
- The real India has...

02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:50.678
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

02:29:52.049 --> 02:29:53.323
How will you separate them?

02:29:53.849 --> 02:29:56.761
Where there is a Muslim majority...

02:29:57.089 --> 02:29:58.807
...that will be Pakistan.

02:29:59.049 --> 02:30:01.517
The rest is your India.

02:30:01.729 --> 02:30:02.684
My dear Jinnah...

02:30:03.289 --> 02:30:07.043
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

02:30:07.289 --> 02:30:11.168
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

02:30:11.409 --> 02:30:12.444
Gentlemen...

02:30:12.689 --> 02:30:14.725
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

02:30:28.409 --> 02:30:32.038
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

02:30:58.409 --> 02:31:00.320
Thank God, they've stopped.

02:31:03.649 --> 02:31:05.367
Manu. Abha.

02:31:12.849 --> 02:31:14.328
I'm your granduncle...

02:31:14.569 --> 02:31:17.766
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

02:31:17.969 --> 02:31:20.358
I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

02:31:20.569 --> 02:31:22.719
Finish your quota of spinning.

02:32:05.449 --> 02:32:07.121
Bapu, please don't do it.

02:32:07.329 --> 02:32:09.923
What do you want me not to do?

02:32:10.209 --> 02:32:12.165
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

02:32:13.889 --> 02:32:15.800
I am a Muslim...

02:32:16.129 --> 02:32:17.084
...and a Hindu...

02:32:17.609 --> 02:32:19.600
...and a Christian and a Jew.

02:32:20.409 --> 02:32:22.764
And so are all of you.

02:32:24.849 --> 02:32:27.522
When you wave those flags and shout...

02:32:27.849 --> 02:32:30.886
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

02:32:31.089 --> 02:32:33.000
That is not the India I want.

02:32:33.249 --> 02:32:34.284
Stop it!

02:32:34.529 --> 02:32:37.362
For God's sake, stop it.

02:32:54.209 --> 02:32:55.881
If you've finished your prayers...

02:32:56.089 --> 02:32:58.762
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

02:33:02.849 --> 02:33:05.682
My dear Jinnah...

02:33:05.929 --> 02:33:08.682
...you and I are brothers...

02:33:08.889 --> 02:33:12.928
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

02:33:13.129 --> 02:33:16.087
...I want to put them at rest.

02:33:16.329 --> 02:33:19.162
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

02:33:19.689 --> 02:33:23.125
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

02:33:23.569 --> 02:33:27.403
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

02:33:27.609 --> 02:33:30.442
...to name your entire cabinet...

02:33:30.649 --> 02:33:34.324
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

02:33:52.209 --> 02:33:54.279
For me and the rest...

02:33:54.529 --> 02:33:56.565
...if that is what you want...

02:33:56.769 --> 02:33:58.964
...we will accept it.

02:34:00.089 --> 02:34:02.239
But out there...

02:34:02.969 --> 02:34:04.527
...already there is rioting...

02:34:04.729 --> 02:34:08.688
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

02:34:09.449 --> 02:34:11.440
If you did this...

02:34:12.049 --> 02:34:14.404
...no one would control it.

02:34:14.969 --> 02:34:16.368
No one.

02:34:31.449 --> 02:34:33.041
It is your choice.

02:34:34.369 --> 02:34:38.362
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

02:34:38.729 --> 02:34:41.118
...or do you want civil war?

02:35:16.449 --> 02:35:19.327
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

02:37:46.329 --> 02:37:49.685
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

02:37:50.089 --> 02:37:51.568
Miracle.

02:37:52.049 --> 02:37:54.244
But millions are on the move...

02:37:54.449 --> 02:37:56.485
...and no one can count the dead.

02:37:58.649 --> 02:38:02.358
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

02:38:04.049 --> 02:38:07.519
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

02:38:08.569 --> 02:38:10.844
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

02:38:12.209 --> 02:38:13.642
If we can't stop it...

02:38:13.849 --> 02:38:16.807
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

02:38:18.009 --> 02:38:20.921
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

02:38:23.169 --> 02:38:24.682
Aren't there any troops to spare?

02:38:26.289 --> 02:38:27.199
Nothing.

02:38:30.969 --> 02:38:32.197
Nothing.

02:38:36.409 --> 02:38:39.207
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

02:38:39.449 --> 02:38:43.647
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:46.079
We could cut all news off.

02:38:46.649 --> 02:38:48.162
Bapu, please, where are you going?

02:38:48.729 --> 02:38:50.162
I don't want to hear more.

02:38:51.569 --> 02:38:53.241
We need your help.

02:38:53.769 --> 02:38:56.078
There is nothing I can give.

02:38:59.009 --> 02:39:00.203
Where are you going?

02:39:03.449 --> 02:39:04.723
Calcutta.

02:39:46.249 --> 02:39:50.162
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

02:39:50.369 --> 02:39:52.325
...nor would you be concerned for me.

02:39:52.529 --> 02:39:54.406
But, sir, please.

02:39:54.649 --> 02:39:56.958
I don't have the men to protect you...

02:39:57.169 --> 02:39:59.808
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

02:40:00.009 --> 02:40:03.001
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and...

02:40:03.209 --> 02:40:06.997
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

02:40:08.449 --> 02:40:10.519
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

02:40:10.769 --> 02:40:11.884
They are murderers!

02:40:12.129 --> 02:40:13.278
They killed my family!

02:40:13.529 --> 02:40:15.406
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

02:40:15.609 --> 02:40:18.282
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

02:41:05.089 --> 02:41:06.204
Prime Minister.

02:41:11.009 --> 02:41:13.762
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

02:41:18.649 --> 02:41:21.117
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

02:41:21.649 --> 02:41:22.764
We will go Friday.

02:41:23.649 --> 02:41:24.684
Four days, sir?

02:41:57.129 --> 02:41:59.563
Sardar, you have gained weight.

02:41:59.809 --> 02:42:01.925
You must join me in the fast.

02:42:02.129 --> 02:42:04.438
If I fast, I die.

02:42:05.049 --> 02:42:09.042
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

02:42:09.249 --> 02:42:10.398
...to keep you alive.

02:42:11.729 --> 02:42:13.287
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:15.885
I could have come earlier...

02:42:16.089 --> 02:42:18.444
...but your fast has helped.

02:42:19.009 --> 02:42:22.558
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

02:42:22.809 --> 02:42:24.720
...and away from the atrocities.

02:42:24.929 --> 02:42:25.759
But now...

02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:27.798
...it is enough.

02:42:30.369 --> 02:42:34.487
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

02:42:38.009 --> 02:42:41.479
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

02:42:41.689 --> 02:42:42.838
...of all ages...

02:42:43.089 --> 02:42:46.638
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

02:42:47.329 --> 02:42:50.799
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

02:42:51.849 --> 02:42:53.567
I'm glad.

02:42:54.369 --> 02:42:57.167
But it will not be enough.

02:43:12.209 --> 02:43:15.485
You are not so young anymore.

02:43:15.929 --> 02:43:17.408
Don't worry for me.

02:43:18.729 --> 02:43:23.166
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

02:44:29.609 --> 02:44:31.088
Death to Gandhi!

02:44:31.369 --> 02:44:33.564
Who dares say such things?!

02:44:33.929 --> 02:44:35.157
Who?!

02:44:36.409 --> 02:44:39.048
You kill me first!

02:44:40.049 --> 02:44:41.164
Come!

02:44:43.929 --> 02:44:45.282
Where are you?!

02:44:46.169 --> 02:44:47.841
Kill me first!

02:44:50.649 --> 02:44:51.923
Where are you?

02:45:01.969 --> 02:45:05.439
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

02:45:20.329 --> 02:45:22.968
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

02:45:23.249 --> 02:45:26.958
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

02:45:27.249 --> 02:45:28.682
He is now telling them...

02:45:29.209 --> 02:45:31.598
...to go back to their homes...

02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:33.680
...to lay down their arms.

02:45:45.649 --> 02:45:47.719
Think what you can do by living...

02:45:48.049 --> 02:45:51.041
...that you cannot do by dying.

02:46:00.249 --> 02:46:02.524
What do you want?

02:46:05.809 --> 02:46:08.482
That the fighting will stop.

02:46:08.689 --> 02:46:11.123
That you make me believe...

02:46:13.929 --> 02:46:16.648
...that it will never start again.

02:46:25.609 --> 02:46:26.724
Sometimes...

02:46:26.929 --> 02:46:30.524
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

02:46:31.209 --> 02:46:34.167
...and in utter darkness...

02:46:34.849 --> 02:46:37.921
...that God comes to the rescue.

02:46:39.729 --> 02:46:41.082
Gandhiji...

02:46:41.529 --> 02:46:43.042
...is dying...

02:46:44.849 --> 02:46:47.409
...because of our madness.

02:46:49.249 --> 02:46:51.717
Put away your revenge.

02:46:52.049 --> 02:46:56.406
What good will come of more killing?

02:46:56.649 --> 02:46:58.879
Have the courage to do...

02:46:59.089 --> 02:47:02.365
...what you know is right.

02:47:02.849 --> 02:47:04.680
For God's sake...

02:47:05.289 --> 02:47:09.123
...let us embrace like brothers.

02:47:22.449 --> 02:47:24.167
It's our promise.

02:47:24.889 --> 02:47:26.083
We stop.

02:47:28.649 --> 02:47:30.526
Hindu swords.

02:47:31.809 --> 02:47:33.367
It's a promise.

02:47:36.409 --> 02:47:37.762
Go.

02:47:39.449 --> 02:47:40.802
God be with you.

02:47:53.249 --> 02:47:54.648
Here, eat!

02:47:56.089 --> 02:47:56.999
Eat!

02:47:58.649 --> 02:48:00.128
I'm going to hell...

02:48:00.529 --> 02:48:03.089
...but not with your death on my soul.

02:48:03.649 --> 02:48:06.846
Only God decides who goes to hell.

02:48:07.209 --> 02:48:09.006
I killed a child.

02:48:10.569 --> 02:48:13.242
I smashed his head against a wall.

02:48:14.929 --> 02:48:16.157
Why?

02:48:18.249 --> 02:48:19.967
They killed my son.

02:48:22.929 --> 02:48:24.248
My boy.

02:48:26.449 --> 02:48:28.599
The Muslims killed my son!

02:48:33.329 --> 02:48:36.878
I know a way out of hell.

02:48:38.169 --> 02:48:40.478
Find a child.

02:48:40.769 --> 02:48:45.559
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

02:48:45.929 --> 02:48:50.161
A little boy about this high...

02:48:51.769 --> 02:48:54.329
...and raise him as your own.

02:48:57.809 --> 02:49:01.006
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

02:49:02.729 --> 02:49:05.766
...and that you raise him as one.

02:49:32.369 --> 02:49:33.165
Go.

02:49:34.529 --> 02:49:35.325
Go.

02:49:37.329 --> 02:49:38.808
God bless you.

02:50:04.449 --> 02:50:05.359
<i>Bapu?</i>

02:50:11.729 --> 02:50:13.924
There's been no fighting...

02:50:14.529 --> 02:50:15.484
...anywhere.

02:50:16.849 --> 02:50:18.248
It's stopped.

02:50:19.009 --> 02:50:21.477
The madness has stopped.

02:50:25.409 --> 02:50:26.922
It's foolish...

02:50:27.129 --> 02:50:30.599
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

02:50:30.849 --> 02:50:35.639
No. In every temple and mosque...

02:50:36.009 --> 02:50:38.000
...they have pledged to die...

02:50:38.249 --> 02:50:41.127
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

02:50:43.529 --> 02:50:45.201
It is true, Bapu.

02:50:53.049 --> 02:50:54.767
Everywhere.

02:51:28.009 --> 02:51:30.239
Maulana, my friend...

02:51:32.209 --> 02:51:34.643
...could I have some orange juice?

02:51:41.249 --> 02:51:42.841
Then you and I...

02:51:43.049 --> 02:51:45.802
...will take a piece
of bread together.

02:52:14.809 --> 02:52:16.925
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

02:52:25.049 --> 02:52:26.801
<i>That is how you eat muli.</i>

02:52:27.649 --> 02:52:30.163
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

02:52:30.369 --> 02:52:32.405
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

02:52:32.609 --> 02:52:36.079
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

02:52:37.209 --> 02:52:38.961
Mickey Mouse!

02:52:40.129 --> 02:52:42.040
You're really going to Pakistan?

02:52:46.729 --> 02:52:48.526
You are a stubborn man.

02:52:50.529 --> 02:52:52.406
I'm simply going to prove...

02:52:52.609 --> 02:52:55.077
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

02:52:55.329 --> 02:52:58.401
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

02:52:58.649 --> 02:53:01.004
...running around in our own hearts.

02:53:01.569 --> 02:53:04.879
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

02:53:12.209 --> 02:53:16.805
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

02:53:18.369 --> 02:53:20.041
Not a very good one.

02:53:20.249 --> 02:53:22.843
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

02:53:23.049 --> 02:53:26.166
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

02:53:30.409 --> 02:53:31.285
Sardar?

02:53:32.169 --> 02:53:35.525
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

02:53:41.729 --> 02:53:43.845
- Enough!
- One more.

02:53:44.169 --> 02:53:46.763
- You're a temptress!
- Just an admirer.

02:53:47.009 --> 02:53:49.045
Nothing's more dangerous...

02:53:49.289 --> 02:53:51.359
...especially for an old man.

02:54:00.449 --> 02:54:02.565
There's a sadness about him.

02:54:04.049 --> 02:54:05.562
He thinks he's failed.

02:54:05.809 --> 02:54:07.162
Why?

02:54:07.409 --> 02:54:10.719
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

02:54:12.369 --> 02:54:14.803
I may be blinded by my love for him...

02:54:15.529 --> 02:54:16.757
...but I believe...

02:54:17.009 --> 02:54:19.079
...when we most needed it...

02:54:19.289 --> 02:54:22.326
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

02:54:24.929 --> 02:54:26.203
But he doesn't see it.

02:54:27.129 --> 02:54:28.960
Neither does the world.

02:55:01.089 --> 02:55:03.159
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

02:55:05.849 --> 02:55:07.567
<i>Oh, God!</i>

02:55:08.329 --> 02:55:10.206
<i>Oh, God.</i>

02:55:47.329 --> 02:55:49.240
<i>When I despair...</i>

02:55:49.529 --> 02:55:51.360
<i>... I remember...</i>

02:55:51.689 --> 02:55:53.839
<i>... that all through history...</i>

02:55:54.049 --> 02:55:58.361
<i>... the way of truth and love
has always won.</i>

02:56:00.129 --> 02:56:03.565
<i>There have been tyrants
and murderers...</i>

02:56:03.809 --> 02:56:06.721
<i>... and for a time,
they can seem invincible...</i>

02:56:06.929 --> 02:56:10.205
<i>... but in the end, they always fall.</i>

02:56:11.849 --> 02:56:13.328
<i>Think of it.</i>

02:56:15.009 --> 02:56:16.567
<i>Always.</i>

02:56:17.305 --> 02:56:23.220
