02:11.332 --> 02:24.445
Corpse Prison:
Part One

03:19.600 --> 03:21.135
I'm not feeling well.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.604
Are we there yet?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.773
We're almost there.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.641
I'm thirsty.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.844
Stop at a convenience store.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.379
Stop complaining.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.581
Or get out of the van and walk home.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.448
Whatever.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.349
Come on, Sagiri.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.018
You only came to pass this class.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.687
Like you're any different.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.357
Is that all you guys care about?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.593
Mere participation won't do.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.862
What? What do you mean?

03:47.862 --> 03:49.797
This isn't a field trip.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.633
You'll submit a field work report.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.169
A good one, if you'd like to pass.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.671
No. Now you're telling us this?

03:58.105 --> 04:00.641
You were sleeping the whole way here.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.109
Shut up.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.411
Oh, well.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.649
You're going to write my report, too.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.285
What? But...

04:11.385 --> 04:12.887
Got a problem with that?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.923
No. I'll do it.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.664
This road isn't on the map. Will we be okay?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.466
Well...

04:26.934 --> 04:30.037
I'm not sure.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.172
What?

04:32.106 --> 04:35.009
But I know we're on the right road.

04:35.810 --> 04:39.246
It's the only road that leads us to Yasaka Village.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.783
That's quite bizarre anyway.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.920
There's no reception around here.

04:46.787 --> 04:51.459
Keeping the village inaccessible
must have been crucial in olden times.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.928
To keep out bandits.

04:55.863 --> 05:00.568
We might come across some
unthinkable village customs here,

05:00.568 --> 05:03.304
a village cut off from the outside world.

05:09.109 --> 05:09.977
Damn.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.286
Sorry.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.422
We're not okay.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.075
You're not pushing, are you?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.676
No, you're not pushing.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.012
Are you all right, Sayori?

05:48.649 --> 05:49.583
Sayofl?

05:50.784 --> 05:51.552
Professor.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.388
Are you okay?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.090
I'm fine.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.264
Let's rest a bit.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.932
Yes.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.135
Just great.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.237
It's getting dark.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.273
Spend the night in the van?

06:12.273 --> 06:13.674
Not a chance.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.943
We'll freeze to death without the heater.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
I want to go home.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.451
Over here. Please stop.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.054
Thank God.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.860
The chief sent us to look for you.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.929
Luckily we had gasoline with us.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.797
You saved us.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.934
Not one gas station once we got off the main road.

06:39.934 --> 06:42.937
We thought that you were attacked by a bear.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.906
You were out of luck.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.443
The chief's house isn't far. You're almost there.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.645
Thank you very much.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.482
Well well, look at these hotties.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.185
The villagers will jump for joy.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.354
What a blessing.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.425
Creepy.

07:04.425 --> 07:07.194
Don't worry. They're not talking about you.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.798
I'm Amano, the village chief.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.035
It must have been a long trip for you.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.272
I'm Ashihara of Hirasaka University.

07:18.272 --> 07:23.010
Thank you for allowing us to
hold our seminar field work here.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.314
I'm Assistant Kagosaka. Pleased to meet you.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.351
And these are the students.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.019
Pleased to meet you.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.088
Pleased to meet you.

07:34.722 --> 07:39.259
Your rooms are upstairs.
Please make yourselves at home.

07:40.227 --> 07:45.065
Although we won't be able to help you
since we don't have a maid.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.534
Where is your wife?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.905
She's been bedridden for many years now.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.442
Forgive me for my impertinence.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.610
That's all right.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.781
This is my son, Takahiko.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.083
Pleasure to meet you.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.419
Speak out loud.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.025
He doesn't even have a girlfriend.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.627
Say, Takahiko.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.530
Look at all these wonderful ladies.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.800
Why don't you hit on one of them?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.168
Please, Father.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.271
Come on. Which one is your type?

08:24.438 --> 08:25.806
Stop it.

08:27.574 --> 08:28.976
What is it with you?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.679
Sorry, Father.

08:33.681 --> 08:37.484
May I take a look at that over there?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.458
It's a mask of Sarutahiko-no-kami.

08:45.726 --> 08:50.931
According to legend, this village was founded by him.

08:52.232 --> 08:58.105
He later gave this mask and control of
the village to our Amano Family.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.843
Which generation village chief are you?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.113
I'm the 41st generation.

09:06.947 --> 09:12.286
I'd like Takahiko to take over,
but as you can see he's not ready.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.488
Is it a Tengu?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.558
Sarutahiko-no-kami.

09:17.558 --> 09:22.029
He guided Ninigi-no-mikoto from heaven
to earth in Japanese Mythology.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.964
Am I supposed to know this?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.734
One hypothesis goes like this.

09:26.734 --> 09:31.538
Sarutahiko-no-kami is the husband of
Amanouzume-no-mikoto of Amano-iwa-yado.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.807
Very good.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.044
I'll also show you the mask of Uzume later.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.912
Thank you very much.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.517
Chief. It's ready.

09:44.084 --> 09:44.985
All right.

09:46.386 --> 09:51.959
We shall now commence
the wedding ceremony of these ladies.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.528
That was pretty intense.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.832
I didn't get it at all.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.069
Good work, everybody.

12:17.771 --> 12:22.242
That was the Foot Amputation Ceremony.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.310
Thank you.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.547
Foot amputation?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.082
Yes.

12:29.983 --> 12:34.421
It's a ceremony to welcome women from the outer world.

12:34.721 --> 12:40.661
Now they are brides of Yasaka Village.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.630
Ceremony to welcome brides from outside?

12:44.765 --> 12:47.367
I got to see such a rare event.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.669
Thank you.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.671
The pleasure is mine.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.274
It looks like dinner is ready.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.311
Please enjoy the evening.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.990
I appreciate this, Professor.

13:10.090 --> 13:10.891
No, no.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.959
Thank you.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.427
Thank you as well.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.430
Takahiko. Why are you sitting there?

13:17.064 --> 13:19.766
Take this and go talk to the girls.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.406
Takahiko. Over here.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.442
Pour my glass.

13:28.442 --> 13:30.310
After he pours mine.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.481
Ultimately, you prefer the young handsome guy, huh?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.683
I think you guys are handsome too.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.718
Really?

13:37.718 --> 13:40.420
Takahiko. You're annoying. Go somewhere else.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.089
Beat it.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.790
That's mean.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.959
Are you jealous?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.195
Well, sort of.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.229
Please.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.666
Thanks, but I don't drink.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.568
I see.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.669
Sorry.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.536
It's fine.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.340
I can't watch him.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.576
Professor.

14:02.676 --> 14:07.347
Won't you teach him how to approach a girl?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.016
I could never.

14:09.116 --> 14:12.052
I'm actually clueless in that department myself.

14:12.753 --> 14:14.888
I don't believe you.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.859
You seduced all those cuties into joining your class.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.028
No. That's not at all the case.

14:21.028 --> 14:25.732
I swear to God that I've never
regarded them as sex objects.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.469
Do you swear on Sarutahiko-no-kami?

14:30.037 --> 14:32.205
Yes, I swear.

14:35.308 --> 14:39.112
At any rate, we appreciate you coming.

14:40.347 --> 14:44.785
We were worried whether
you'd really keep your promise or not.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.157
I knew I could count on you.

14:50.157 --> 14:54.161
Well, then. Let's drink up tonight.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.328
Here.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.604
What's wrong?

15:04.738 --> 15:05.639
Nothing.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.676
What was that ceremony about?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.578
I don't know.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.381
Let's ask the chief later.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.016
I guess.

15:18.452 --> 15:21.521
There's something strange about this village.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.391
What meat is this anyway?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.595
I don't know, but it's delicious.

15:31.398 --> 15:35.235
What kind of meat is this?

15:35.235 --> 15:37.737
Specialty of Yasaka Village, bear meat.

15:38.205 --> 15:42.876
Sarutahiko and bears, the gods
of the mountain, were friends.

15:42.876 --> 15:46.580
Bears of this village love the flesh of young women.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.719
Don't scare me.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.621
Eat, eat.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.189
Thank you.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.124
I have to use the bathroom.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.788
Hi.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.059
Wait.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.404
What is it? What is it?

16:47.040 --> 16:50.043
Isuke. What are you doing?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.084
Is that for Michiyo?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.253
All right. Just go.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.821
Yes.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.965
That's Isuke who takes care of my bedridden wife.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.634
He's a bit slow.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.873
Why butcher a chicken at this hour?

17:19.973 --> 17:22.075
I'm sorry I caused a scene.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.078
Who could blame her? He looks like a monster.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.113
Isuke is Isuke after all.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.382
Let's get back to partying.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.454
Excuse me.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.625
I'm not feeling too well. I'll be in my room.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.229
You must be tired from the long trip.

17:42.963 --> 17:45.265
The bath is ready. Please enjoy.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.600
Thank you very much.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.042
Takagi.

17:56.977 --> 17:57.911
Yes?

17:58.979 --> 18:03.583
You've got to be able to enjoy the vibe of this village,

18:03.583 --> 18:05.885
if you wish to get any work done.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.787
Sorry.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.725
But it's not really about the vibe.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.961
I feel something rather ominous.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.597
Oh Takahiko, you're adorable.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.399
How about me, then?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.800
You're adorable, too.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.238
There's no need to behave like those girls, but...

18:25.238 --> 18:29.242
being able to might be crucial in studying folkloristics.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.480
Yes.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.150
Who is it?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.820
Isuke.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.958
I put towel here.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.062
Thank you very much.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.501
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.205
Me, okay.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.493
Gosh, I'm pathetic.

21:03.329 --> 21:06.232
Those girls have no idea what's going on?

21:08.802 --> 21:10.437
I know.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.472
We must do something.

21:17.744 --> 21:22.148
I'm so wasted.

21:22.148 --> 21:27.153
You were actually giving Takahiko the look weren't you?

21:27.520 --> 21:30.623
He's so adorable.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.926
I bet he's a virgin.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.328
Let him fuck you.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.665
It's time to show what Slut Sagiri is made of.

21:40.433 --> 21:44.471
Still holding a grudge against me
over your loss in the beauty contest?

21:44.571 --> 21:49.075
You just seduced the jury into voting for you.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.977
Whatever.

21:51.077 --> 21:54.514
Listen to the loser whine.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.782
Shut up, Ugly.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.686
Ah, I'm so bored.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.860
You're working already?

22:07.427 --> 22:11.164
No. Just making a note so I won't forget some things.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.967
You're so serious.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.436
Send me your notes when we return to Tokyo.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.404
Okay.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.741
Don't send her anything.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.679
I'm the only one who gets your report.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.683
We promised, remember?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.118
Don't worry.

22:32.218 --> 22:35.588
Nobody will ever find out.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.462
What are you whispering about?

22:42.462 --> 22:45.164
None of your business.

22:47.267 --> 22:51.371
Girls. Take a bath and go to bed.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.239
You're not at your own house.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.608
Yes.

22:56.142 --> 23:00.213
Also, I can smell plagiarism from a mile away.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.949
So, copy others' work at your own risk.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.984
Goodnight.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.155
I bet she's a virgin.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.293
You're clueless, you know that?

23:13.626 --> 23:14.527
What?

23:15.862 --> 23:17.363
Nothing.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.386
You shouldn't be here.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.755
Go back to your room.

23:45.325 --> 23:46.726
Professor.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.097
Why aren't there any women in this village?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.267
So, you've noticed?

23:55.969 --> 24:01.007
According to documents, no girl has
ever been born in this village.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.478
How could a village last like that?

24:07.413 --> 24:11.718
That's actually the focus of this investigation.

24:13.019 --> 24:16.823
Don't tell the students about this.

24:20.994 --> 24:23.730
Why did you bring the girls here?

24:24.797 --> 24:27.367
Even if it meant luring them with credits.

24:28.534 --> 24:31.437
Field work is a great learning experience.

24:34.874 --> 24:39.379
No scientific research has ever been
carried out in Yasaka Village.

24:41.147 --> 24:46.819
Many renowned scientists were refused
entry into the village in the past.

24:52.558 --> 24:57.196
How did you convince the village chief?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.502
It seems like you see through everything.

25:06.372 --> 25:09.108
You used the girls as a bargaining chip.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.184
That's what the chief asked for.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.522
He asked me to bring him young women.

25:23.556 --> 25:27.960
In exchange for full support in the research.

25:29.696 --> 25:33.466
He wanted to find a bride for his son.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.470
I guess so.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.906
But the deal isn't necessarily immoral.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.543
I arranged for a man and woman to meet.

25:43.643 --> 25:46.145
From there, they have free will.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.483
They won't be eaten alive or anything.

25:52.018 --> 25:52.985
No.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.155
It's certainly immoral.

25:58.191 --> 26:00.426
It's extremely chauvinistic.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.100
Is that why you brought me with you?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.169
No, it's different with you.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.942
You'd happily use women to pursue your studies.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.011
That's exactly who you are.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.088
Don't.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.130
I'm serious about us.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.834
I'll tell my wife about you when the time is right.

26:41.934 --> 26:42.735
So...

26:42.835 --> 26:44.137
It's okay.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.272
Don't say anything.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.553
Stop it.

27:03.156 --> 27:04.590
They'll hear us.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.193
That's what makes it exciting.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.952
What are you peeping at?

27:45.965 --> 27:49.001
Mitsuha. No more peeping, okay?

28:00.246 --> 28:01.280
Yummy?

28:16.963 --> 28:19.732
Mitsuha. Don't do such a vulgar thing.

28:43.756 --> 28:44.590
Prof...

29:36.876 --> 29:39.045
We did the Leg Amputation Ceremony.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.380
Do we need to wait any longer?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.848
Yes.

29:43.616 --> 29:47.119
Wait until Takahiko finds himself his bride.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.022
But you know how he is.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.291
I don't think he's into girls.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.828
Then, he would never choose his bride.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.832
We could wait but I don't think the other guys could.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.668
We've been without women for a long time now.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.504
Yes. What are we going to do about that?

30:05.504 --> 30:06.839
Sflence.

30:08.774 --> 30:12.545
Who invited those girls to this village?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.681
Well, we know you did.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.250
What if they catch us off guard and escape?

30:18.351 --> 30:20.720
Make sure they don't.

30:21.153 --> 30:25.658
At any rate, until he finds his bride...

30:26.058 --> 30:29.428
you won't lay a finger on those girls.

31:09.402 --> 31:10.536
Hina?

31:12.705 --> 31:13.873
Sayofl?

31:15.307 --> 31:16.609
Where are you?

31:28.687 --> 31:31.624
Isuke. Have you seen Hina and Sayori?

32:13.332 --> 32:14.500
Help me.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.938
What's going on?

32:19.738 --> 32:22.608
You must be hungry from running like that.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.477
Why don't you join us?

32:25.678 --> 32:27.680
They're all...

32:28.080 --> 32:30.983
They must be taking a bath.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.284
See?

32:32.384 --> 32:35.154
The temperature seems just right.

32:38.991 --> 32:42.828
Young girls taste so fresh and delicious.

32:43.596 --> 32:44.830
Certainly.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.432
Essential for longevity.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.135
That's absolutely right.

33:03.883 --> 33:07.119
Isuke. Bring us some more meat.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.120
Yes.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.131
What's wrong?

33:23.569 --> 33:24.637
Nothing.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.773
I'm going to go wash my face.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.092
You shouldn't.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.699
We'll be back by sunset.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.937
Please be very careful.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.305
Careful?

35:06.805 --> 35:09.141
There are bears in the mountain.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.309
Really?

35:11.744 --> 35:13.746
I'm just joking.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.416
They should all be hibernating now.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.687
We'll be careful.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.844
Takahiko.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.947
Have you decided?

35:49.248 --> 35:50.382
No.

35:51.183 --> 35:53.452
You have no time to spare.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.487
This isn't just about you.

35:55.487 --> 35:59.792
It concerns this whole Village,
let alone the Amano Family.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.827
I have...

36:02.995 --> 36:05.064
Are you referring to Mitsuha?

36:06.932 --> 36:09.368
The girl is cursed.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.172
Once you get married, I'll offer her to Sarutahiko.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.709
I won't let you live idly any longer.

36:16.709 --> 36:17.576
But...

36:17.576 --> 36:19.078
Enough.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.513
Just pick your bride.

36:22.381 --> 36:27.619
God knows what the villagers might do
if you don't act swiftly.

36:42.468 --> 36:46.872
I've always wanted to ask you something.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.007
What is field work?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.409
Just Google it, Idiot.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.444
We have no reception, Ugly.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.146
Tell me, Sayori.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.081
It's a site investigation.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.182
I see.

36:57.750 --> 37:01.487
Why did you guys decide to study folkloristics?

37:02.688 --> 37:04.390
I heard it was an easy course.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.893
Which was apparently not true.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.864
This hangover is killing me.

37:11.864 --> 37:12.998
Me, too.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.268
Are you OK, Hina?

37:16.268 --> 37:19.872
I'm fine. Don't wait for me.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.641
You need to write your report.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.410
Just go.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.878
Let's just go.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.157
What is it between Sayori and you?

37:38.157 --> 37:39.358
What do you mean?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.327
Forget it.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.997
Do you have any cigarettes?

37:44.997 --> 37:46.398
No.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.002
You got any morning relief?

37:50.235 --> 37:52.070
Of course I don't.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.206
Hello. Did you get tired?

37:54.206 --> 37:56.408
Come on, you girls are young.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.111
Any convenience store around here?

37:59.511 --> 38:01.547
There are plenty of them.

38:01.547 --> 38:02.748
Really?

38:02.748 --> 38:05.083
Are you mocking Yasaka Village?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.320
It's hard to find a village without one.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.557
I knew there would be one.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.292
Could you take me there?

38:13.392 --> 38:16.528
Sure. We were just about to go there.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.863
All right.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.300
Sayori.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.603
We're going to go to the restroom.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.862
Are we there yet?

39:57.262 --> 39:59.398
We're almost there.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.668
Is there really a convenience store?

40:04.303 --> 40:06.204
What's a convenience store?

40:06.204 --> 40:09.775
A place where there's everything.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.444
Even girls?

40:12.444 --> 40:14.780
Of course they even have girls.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.883
What a wonderful place.

40:18.050 --> 40:21.386
Yasaka Village is the closest place to heaven.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.857
I don't like where this is going.

40:25.857 --> 40:26.992
Me neither.

40:28.327 --> 40:29.428
Um...

40:30.262 --> 40:32.130
We've changed our minds.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.837
Stop the car.

40:40.839 --> 40:41.840
Stop it.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.128
Are you okay?

41:03.228 --> 41:04.296
Yes.

41:05.597 --> 41:09.501
Just how far could the bathroom be?

41:14.373 --> 41:15.941
Sayori.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.477
Does Hina have something on you?

41:19.611 --> 41:21.613
I feel awkward watching you two.

41:21.713 --> 41:24.016
You don't have to listen to her.

41:24.016 --> 41:26.184
She can't make you do something.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.487
She's not forcing me.

41:29.755 --> 41:33.625
I know she's using you to pass this class.

41:34.126 --> 41:36.995
She's exploiting your timid nature.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.030
Stop it.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.332
Don't...

41:41.733 --> 41:43.135
badmouth Hina.

41:45.003 --> 41:45.904
Sorry.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.975
Hina's my best friend.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.149
Hello?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.751
Anybody there?

42:04.823 --> 42:06.992
We really shouldn't.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.328
This place might be abandoned.

42:12.264 --> 42:15.834
Hello? Anyone in there?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.604
Hello?

42:23.008 --> 42:24.476
Anybody there?

42:50.936 --> 42:52.170
Hey, Professor.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.677
Professor...

43:13.191 --> 43:14.059
Professor.

43:17.429 --> 43:18.797
Who are you people?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.602
You're not from the village.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.605
Where are you from?

43:27.005 --> 43:29.708
We're university students from Tokyo.

43:31.076 --> 43:34.212
This place is off-limits to strangers.

43:35.347 --> 43:36.782
Yes.

43:38.483 --> 43:44.956
But we've actually attended a ceremony last night,

43:45.423 --> 43:48.460
which officially made us village members.

43:48.827 --> 43:49.928
Ceremony?

43:50.829 --> 43:51.696
Which...

43:51.696 --> 43:52.864
Excuse me.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.535
I'm their supervisor.

43:57.269 --> 43:58.270
You are?

43:58.270 --> 43:59.137
Yes.

44:00.105 --> 44:03.008
I'm Ashihara of Hirasaka University.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.978
I'm Kayano, the chief priest of this shrine.

44:09.381 --> 44:11.516
What are you here for?

44:11.516 --> 44:16.688
Village chief Amano gave me permission
to conduct an investigation.

44:16.688 --> 44:20.392
We're learning various aspects of this village.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.428
I wasn't informed of this.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.530
I see.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.367
I had no way of making arrangements in advance.

44:31.036 --> 44:36.675
The Amano Family and this Uzume Shrine
have never got along very well.

44:38.677 --> 44:42.814
It's absurd that the Uzume mask is
kept in the Amano Residence.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.219
Please excuse my lack of knowledge.

44:49.821 --> 44:52.924
So, what is this ceremony that you spoke of?

44:54.359 --> 44:59.397
They called it the Foot Amputation Ceremony.

45:01.967 --> 45:05.904
It's based on a ceremony held to
welcome brides from outside.

45:09.808 --> 45:11.042
Wait...

45:12.677 --> 45:14.579
Leave the village at once.

45:15.714 --> 45:17.682
Otherwise misfortune will befall you.

45:56.655 --> 45:58.323
No, No...

45:58.823 --> 45:59.858
Let go of me.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.629
Stop it.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.068
Stop it.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.644
Don't worry.

46:19.744 --> 46:21.513
The villagers won't know about this.

46:21.746 --> 46:23.348
They still have three girls there.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.718
That's enough for that scrawny son.

46:29.955 --> 46:34.292
I haven't done anything,
but she looks like she's about to die.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.027
This one is nice and lively.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.443
You little...

47:35.053 --> 47:35.954
Help...

47:39.357 --> 47:40.325
Run.

47:45.797 --> 47:46.831
Hina.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.433
Get up.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.734
Stop.

47:51.136 --> 47:53.038
Stop it.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.206
Get off.

48:00.745 --> 48:01.880
Tagishi.

48:02.414 --> 48:04.049
Hold her legs.

48:06.084 --> 48:08.420
We need to do it like the ceremony.

48:08.653 --> 48:10.989
Better not kill the girl this time.

48:10.989 --> 48:13.958
Stop. I'm sorry.

48:13.958 --> 48:15.460
Sorry. Help me.

48:15.727 --> 48:16.895
Too late now.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.201
What the...?

49:28.600 --> 49:29.801
Hina.

49:38.443 --> 49:40.078
You're going to kill me?

49:51.322 --> 49:52.590
You're...

49:54.926 --> 49:56.227
Run.

50:01.432 --> 50:04.669
This village... bad.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.106
You saved me?

50:09.707 --> 50:11.209
Go. Now.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.417
Hurry.

50:21.452 --> 50:23.054
What about the others?

50:24.923 --> 50:26.624
Will they be raped too?

50:31.162 --> 50:33.031
Then, I can't run away alone.

50:34.632 --> 50:36.367
Take me back to the house.

50:36.801 --> 50:38.703
I need to warn everyone.

50:40.605 --> 50:42.006
Hurry up!

51:41.532 --> 51:44.235
Where am I?

51:53.511 --> 51:55.246
We need to tell the chief.

52:06.724 --> 52:07.825
Wait.

52:12.030 --> 52:12.964
Don't look.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.166
Sorry.

52:37.221 --> 52:38.890
Thank you.

52:40.391 --> 52:41.659
Let's hurry.

52:41.993 --> 52:42.927
Yes.

52:46.931 --> 52:48.199
Name.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.769
My Flame?

52:52.603 --> 52:54.138
I haven't told you?

52:55.273 --> 52:56.708
Sagiri Yoshioka.

52:58.142 --> 52:59.610
Sagiri.

53:00.611 --> 53:03.881
And you're lppei?

53:03.881 --> 53:07.318
No. Isuke.

53:08.820 --> 53:10.588
That's right.

53:11.589 --> 53:12.857
Nice to meet you, Isuke.

53:15.493 --> 53:16.894
Isuke.

53:17.562 --> 53:21.733
Thanks for saving me, but that was a bit too extreme.

53:23.267 --> 53:24.969
Please don't kill anymore.

53:27.572 --> 53:28.606
Promise me.

53:29.941 --> 53:31.342
All right.

53:32.043 --> 53:35.179
I promise you.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.658
You don't know who did it?

53:48.860 --> 53:51.996
You saw Tsuyama get murdered, right?

53:52.864 --> 53:55.099
He had an Uzume mask on.

53:55.199 --> 53:57.168
He could be an outsider.

53:57.635 --> 54:01.873
I think you two got in a fight over the girls.

54:01.873 --> 54:04.642
That's not it. We took them to the shed.

54:04.642 --> 54:08.646
They were trying to escape from the village.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.882
Bull shit.

54:11.349 --> 54:16.087
You two practically killed the girl who came last summer.

54:16.621 --> 54:18.923
That wasn't my fault.

54:19.991 --> 54:22.126
Chief. Please believe me.

54:22.226 --> 54:25.563
I did it for the village.

54:26.431 --> 54:28.232
I could care less.

54:30.735 --> 54:33.070
This discussion is meaningless.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.607
The girls are alive.

54:38.109 --> 54:40.478
Hurry up and go find them.

54:41.179 --> 54:44.449
The villagers are looking for them in the forest.

54:45.183 --> 54:49.454
Nobody could get out of the forest without a guide.

54:50.188 --> 54:53.891
We've closed the village exit. They're completely trapped.

54:54.992 --> 54:58.196
All right. Don't kill them.

54:58.830 --> 55:03.901
Don't forget that they're also Takahiko's bride candidates.

55:17.548 --> 55:19.717
That's Sarutahiko-no-kami.

55:22.353 --> 55:24.956
Who is she? Is that you?

55:27.191 --> 55:28.059
I see.

55:30.294 --> 55:31.395
Mitsuha.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.198
Would you like to leave this attic?

55:36.434 --> 55:40.304
But I might not be able to return here for a long time.

56:06.030 --> 56:09.834
We'd better find them before sunset
or else we're finished.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.570
No different for the girls.

56:13.571 --> 56:15.840
Maybe the bears are eating them now.

56:15.840 --> 56:19.877
Idiot. We can't let bears take those precious girls from us.

56:31.155 --> 56:32.089
Let's go.

57:28.079 --> 57:30.114
Why am I getting no reception?

57:34.385 --> 57:37.054
Come rescue me, Sayori.

57:37.955 --> 57:42.026
You said you'd die for me.

57:42.393 --> 57:43.427
Damn it.

57:44.228 --> 57:47.331
Help me, Sayori.

57:47.431 --> 57:48.666
Sayori...

57:48.666 --> 57:51.235
Over here.

57:51.702 --> 57:54.572
There she is.

59:27.131 --> 59:28.432
ATengu...

59:30.434 --> 59:31.602
God?

59:37.842 --> 59:39.844
Help me, God.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.728
I hope Hina and Sagiri are okay.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:34.565
They're with the villagers, right?

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.668
They must be drinking like crazy.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:44.675
I got a call from Tsuyama.

01:00:45.543 --> 01:00:47.478
They're drinking together.

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:50.848
I knew it. Sorry for the trouble.

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:52.149
Not at all.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.885
I'm sure it's the guys' idea.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:58.088
I'll make Takahiko go get them later.

01:00:58.189 --> 01:00:59.456
So don't worry.

01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:01.692
Thank you very much.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:06.664
Where's Dr. Ashihara?

01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:10.034
He's doing some research.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:14.605
He doesn't even eat once he gets in the mode.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:45.936
Shut the door.

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:47.438
Now.

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:48.672
Yes.

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:53.811
What's wrong?

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:05.155
600 years ago, this village was secluded from the world.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:10.494
There were very few baby girls, probably due to incest.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:17.801
After repeated famines and epidemics,

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:22.206
the village ultimately lost all of its female population.

01:02:23.007 --> 01:02:27.912
Then one clay, a couple visited the village.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.415
The villagers...

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:37.054
considered the couple as a gift
from their god, Sarutahiko-no-kami.

01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:42.393
They killed and ate the man, and raped the woman.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:49.600
They cut off the foot of the woman,
and made her their comfort woman.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:53.804
She gave birth to babies of many men in the village.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:03:00.711
Her leg was infested with maggots,
so she was called the "Maggot Lady."

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:04.848
That's horrible.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.851
Incredibly enough...

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.689
the story doesn't end there.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:18.762
They continued to do the same to
other women that visited the village.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:25.536
Communization of these women became
a norm and a custom.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.073
The babies born there were still all boys.

01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:33.377
The villagers thought they were cursed
by past Maggot Ladies.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.113
So, they built a shrine for her.

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:41.218
And worshipped her as Amanouzume,
who had a connection with Sarutahiko.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.425
But the curse hasn't been broken,
and no baby girl has been born since.

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:55.232
So, this village had to continue to hunt women.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:01.405
It's just an old tale.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:03.941
Of course it's just an old tale.

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:14.551
Where did you get that book?

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:19.356
I can't have you going through our things like that.

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:22.292
Deeply sorry.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.731
Are you looking at this?

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:31.835
It seems like a bear showed up in the vicinity.

01:04:33.504 --> 01:04:37.474
We're going hunting.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.420
I need to talk to you two.

01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:51.955
Please follow me.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.526
Sure.

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.446
Get the girls out of here.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.848
Got it?

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.497
Just go. Hurry.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:34.498
Yes.

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:39.069
A woman has escaped.

01:05:39.837 --> 01:05:42.573
She's on the loose!

01:05:43.574 --> 01:05:45.275
Just get in.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.612
I'll explain later.

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:51.548
Hurry!

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.450
There they are.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:17.774
No. You said you won't kill them.

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:20.277
Get in. Hurry.

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:21.545
Sagiri.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:22.479
Why?

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.751
Me. Isuke.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.219
It's okay. He's on our side.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.854
Start the car.

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.955
What's women hunt?

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:08.158
It's a custom of this village.

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:11.795
I just can't believe that.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.630
You're going to have to.

01:07:14.298 --> 01:07:15.599
Hina and I were attacked.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:16.867
Where's Hina?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.168
Where is she?

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:19.803
I don't know.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.773
She pushed me away and ran away.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.275
No way.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:29.046
Don't worry. She's indestructible.

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.047
I can't.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:34.618
I can't live without Hina.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.688
She's all I've got.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.991
Hina's my everything.

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:49.633
I knew you guys were lovers.

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.317
Any news?

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.586
They haven't come, but they will soon.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.556
This is the only way out from the village.

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:14.324
All right.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.426
I'm heading that way. We'll trap them from both sides.

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:20.497
Make sure they don't get away.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.354
We'll be fine.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:49.059
The road ahead leads us out of the village.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.261
Stop the car.

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.096
Please, stop.

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.433
Are you out of your mind?

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:58.468
I can't leave without Hina.

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:00.103
I have to find her.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.372
Please. Stop the car.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:06.009
Hey, Sayori.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.144
Calm down.

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.981
What's your problem?

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.417
I'm not your parent.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.952
I could've escaped alone.

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:21.124
I'm only doing this because Dr. Ashihara told me to.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.227
I'm doing this for him.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:28.799
He's still in the house.

01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:32.836
He might even be dead.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:40.977
This isn't easy for any of us.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:46.917
Stop.

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:49.886
Now you?

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:52.288
Exit... bad.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:02.699
You're not going anywhere.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:47.344
They read our plan.

01:10:47.878 --> 01:10:49.579
They're cutting through the forest.

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:10.901
Fools!

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:12.969
You were outwitted by a bunch of girls.

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.538
Sorry, Chief.

01:11:14.538 --> 01:11:19.376
If they escape and talk, this village is finished.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:27.083
Once Takahiko picks his bride the rest will be yours.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:32.856
For the sake of this village,
don't let any girl escape from here.
