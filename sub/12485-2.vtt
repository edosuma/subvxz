00:07.910 --> 00:10.650
Hey, I hear there's
a new Ant starting today.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.680
But Gibson's not here

00:12.720 --> 00:16.720
and he always says,
"Welcome to the Ant Farm."

00:16.750 --> 00:20.060
Someone has to say,
"Welcome to the Ant Farm."

00:20.090 --> 00:24.700
Seriously. Who's gonna say,
"Welcome to the Ant Farm"?

00:24.730 --> 00:27.770
Well, of course.
It's so obvious.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.770
Olive could do it.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.910
She always says it
when Gibson does, anyway.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.710
Yes, but in a mocking way.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.850
Well, how about this time you
can say it, and I'll mock you?

00:37.880 --> 00:39.680
No! That's my thing.

00:39.710 --> 00:40.880
Why do you always get
to be the one to mock?

00:40.920 --> 00:42.780
Why do you always get
to be the one to mock?

00:42.820 --> 00:45.990
Wow, you are good at it.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.790
I'll do it. Maybe this new
Ant will be a smokin' babe.

00:48.820 --> 00:50.830
Everyone, meet the new Ant.

00:53.030 --> 00:56.800
You were right about the babe part.

00:56.830 --> 00:58.000
This is Sebastian.

00:58.030 --> 01:00.900
Isn't Sebastian a little
too young for high school?

01:00.940 --> 01:04.670
You're all too young for high school!

01:04.709 --> 01:06.840
Yeah, but at least we can
all sit up by ourselves.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.760
Well, at least most of us can.

01:17.790 --> 01:21.060
Anyway, Sebastian is a very advanced baby.

01:21.090 --> 01:23.890
So I expect you guys to find his talent.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.000
Why do we have to do it?

01:26.030 --> 01:29.070
Because if you don't you'll
spend so much time in detention

01:29.100 --> 01:31.000
it will start to feel like home.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.000
And not your fancy, comfortable homes.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.910
My home. The kind you buy
on a principal's salary!

01:40.010 --> 01:41.980
Principal Skidmore, hold on a second.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.010
Bye!
Don't leave me...

01:46.920 --> 01:47.950
What are we supposed to do now?

01:47.990 --> 01:48.050
I know.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.860
Welcome to the Ant Farm!

02:49.820 --> 02:52.720
Wow, this baby is a crybaby.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.730
Hey, maybe we should try making him laugh.

02:57.030 --> 02:59.100
Peek-a-boo!

03:00.970 --> 03:02.000
Peek-a-boo!

03:03.100 --> 03:03.940
I don't understand.

03:03.970 --> 03:07.940
That makes Cameron laugh all the time.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.810
Somebody else please try something.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.920
Angus, that's not gonna make him laugh.

03:17.950 --> 03:18.890
I wasn't trying to be funny.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.750
I just think better with my pants off.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.790
Speaking of which,

03:24.830 --> 03:26.730
I've got a math test now.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.970
Ooh, I know how to make the baby laugh!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.900
Okay. So a sailor, a nurse,
driving to Vegas...

03:34.940 --> 03:35.870
Fletcher!

03:35.900 --> 03:36.070
Ow!

03:39.940 --> 03:42.780
Hey! He stopped crying.

03:44.980 --> 03:45.980
Quick!
Slap Fletcher again!

03:47.080 --> 03:48.780
Ow!

03:51.820 --> 03:54.990
Hey! He's kicking.
Maybe his talent is karate!

04:01.800 --> 04:05.730
Are you crazy?
The baby's talent is not karate!

04:05.770 --> 04:08.700
No kidding.
He didn't even try to fight back.

04:09.970 --> 04:11.870
Don't you think he's a little too young

04:11.910 --> 04:13.740
to be pressured into having a talent?

04:13.780 --> 04:14.640
He should enjoy being a kid.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.880
Enjoy being a kid?

04:16.910 --> 04:19.910
There's no worse time in a
person's life than childhood.

04:19.950 --> 04:21.880
You guys read my autobiography.

04:24.850 --> 04:25.850
Sure.
A real page-turner.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.060
Can't wait for the movie.

04:33.060 --> 04:33.860
Hey there.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.030
I hope you have your library card

04:36.060 --> 04:37.800
because you're totally checking me out.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.970
Aced it.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.020
Hey, Angus. You forgot your
backpack at my house last night.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.790
By the way, thank you so much.

04:57.820 --> 04:58.790
You were awesome.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.760
You were at Lexi's house last night?

05:04.790 --> 05:07.030
Yup. She practically
begged me to come over.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.630
Why? What were you doing?

05:11.670 --> 05:12.740
Thank you for coming
over to fix my computer.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.910
A gentleman never tells.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.810
Let's just say, thanks to me,

05:22.850 --> 05:25.980
Lexi saw fireworks.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.920
Cool, I can play videos again!

05:28.950 --> 05:31.820
Check out this one I
took on the 4th of July!

05:50.810 --> 05:52.940
I don't think his talent is music.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.880
But he did just compose a movement.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.950
What?

06:00.020 --> 06:02.120
Oh, that kind of movement.

06:03.820 --> 06:04.850
Here you go, buddy.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.860
Diaper up.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.690
I don't think he knows
how to change himself.

06:10.730 --> 06:11.760
What kind of prodigy is this?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.660
We'll just help him.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.760
It can't be that hard.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.940
Wow, this kid does not like
having his diaper changed.

06:25.670 --> 06:26.070
At least he's wearing a clean one now.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.010
Not it!

06:30.040 --> 06:30.740
Not it!

06:32.750 --> 06:33.750
Dang it!

06:38.020 --> 06:42.860
Angus, there you are.
What are you doing out here?

06:42.890 --> 06:44.930
My mom said I spend too
much time on the computer

06:44.960 --> 06:46.990
and not enough time outside.
And now I'm out here.

06:48.860 --> 06:49.760
I don't see the appeal.

06:53.740 --> 06:56.870
That screensaver is really boring.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.740
You mean the sky?

06:58.770 --> 07:00.740
Yeah, whatever.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.080
Listen, I need to talk to you.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.650
I just can't figure out
what someone like Lexi

07:05.680 --> 07:06.980
would want with someone like you.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.950
Dude, I've got skills.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.820
You? Skills?

07:12.860 --> 07:15.760
Okay, look, if you don't believe me,

07:15.790 --> 07:18.030
ask Lexi yourself.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.630
Lexi, does Angus really have skills?

07:21.660 --> 07:23.000
Oh yeah.
I was just telling

07:23.030 --> 07:25.670
the whole cheerleading squad about him.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.700
By the way, a few of them want your number.

07:31.670 --> 07:34.940
Why was I cursed with this gift?

07:39.710 --> 07:40.750
Okay, hold up the canvas.

07:48.790 --> 07:50.860
Well, he definitely has no art talent.

07:52.730 --> 07:52.760
Unlike me.

07:59.970 --> 08:02.000
See?
We're working him too hard.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.670
The poor baby is tired.

Guys! Guys, wake up!

09:11.910 --> 09:13.240
We have a big problem!

09:13.280 --> 09:15.180
Have we been drafted into the army?

09:15.980 --> 09:18.210
How did he pass the physical?

09:20.180 --> 09:20.950
We lost Sebastian.

09:20.980 --> 09:24.950
He went AWOL?
I say we check Canada.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.260
We're not in the army!

09:28.290 --> 09:30.860
We fell asleep and Sebastian
must have crawled away!

09:30.890 --> 09:33.060
We have to find him before
Principal Skidmore...

09:33.090 --> 09:33.960
Where's the baby?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.130
Oh, um...

09:39.170 --> 09:41.200
Olive is just reading him a story.

09:41.240 --> 09:45.100
And then I became the youngest
member of Mensa ever.

09:45.140 --> 09:48.910
Yes, I did. Yes, I did!

09:50.040 --> 09:52.010
Well, as you can see,

09:52.050 --> 09:55.180
Sebastian is safely behind
that comically large book.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.020
We need to find that baby!

10:00.050 --> 10:02.050
I thought Olive was reading him a story.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.230
Wacky!

10:09.260 --> 10:13.100
Have you seen a little, tiny boy
wandering around looking lost?

10:14.170 --> 10:15.000
You have? Where?

10:23.110 --> 10:25.980
Angus!
You found the baby!

10:26.010 --> 10:27.980
What baby?
This is my ham.

10:32.050 --> 10:33.120
Hey, don't look at me like that.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.990
This is extra lean,
low-sodium ham.

10:36.020 --> 10:39.320
Yes, you are!
Yes, you are, my little honey-glazed.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.030
Angus! I need
to know your secret!

10:48.170 --> 10:51.270
Okay, okay.
This ham's not really low-sodium.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.940
I mean how you ever got Lexi to
be interested in a guy like you.

10:56.970 --> 10:59.340
"A guy like me?"

10:59.380 --> 11:03.040
You mean someone who's handsome,
charming, and well-dressed?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.180
You're wearing a meat sling.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.050
Okay, look.
I can't give away my tricks for free.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.990
If you want to have swag like me,

11:12.020 --> 11:12.990
you can attend my online webinar.

11:15.130 --> 11:17.890
Two hundred dollars?
Forget it.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.930
Angus, there you are!

11:19.960 --> 11:21.270
Can you come over tonight?

11:21.300 --> 11:22.200
I really need you.

11:22.230 --> 11:25.240
Again?

11:25.270 --> 11:29.210
It's not like any other guy
around here can do what you do.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.340
Cameron wouldn't even know what to do
if I gave him an instruction manual.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.950
Fine.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.250
There's an instruction manual?

11:44.090 --> 11:46.150
I can't find Sebastian anywhere.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.960
Don't worry, we took care of it.

11:47.990 --> 11:50.190
I whittled a wittle baby!

11:53.030 --> 11:56.170
I think Skidmore's going to
notice he's made of wood.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.930
Relax. We can turn
him into a real boy.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.070
All we have to do is wish upon a star.

12:02.270 --> 12:04.110
If we're wishing upon a star,

12:04.140 --> 12:07.110
why don't we just wish for
Sebastian to come back?

12:07.150 --> 12:09.110
Seems kind of like a boring wish.

12:09.150 --> 12:12.150
Let's wish for laser vision.

12:12.180 --> 12:15.250
Will someone explain how this
baby got into my ham carrier?

12:17.090 --> 12:18.960
Sebastian!

12:20.330 --> 12:23.060
Thank goodness you're okay!

12:26.130 --> 12:28.330
This is not a diaper.
This is a tortilla.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.270
Okay, enough wasting time.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.010
We have to find this baby's talent
before Skidmore shows up again.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.110
I was thinking we could try chemistry.

12:37.140 --> 12:41.080
Now put on your lab coat and your goggles.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.050
He's not wearing goggles.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.280
He really should if he's going
to handle hydrochloric acid.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.020
Forget it!
This baby's done with school.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.260
We're leaving!

12:51.290 --> 12:54.160
Hey! You're not going
anywhere with that thing.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.990
This is my ham's blanket.

13:11.410 --> 13:13.140
No. No, no, no, no.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.180
Roxanne! We said
two was enough!

13:18.180 --> 13:21.120
Someone's a little cranky after their nap.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.220
Well, I didn't get my solid two hours.

13:28.260 --> 13:29.330
Chyna?

13:30.260 --> 13:31.260
Who is this?

13:32.470 --> 13:35.330
This is Sebastian.
He's a friend from class.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.270
Freshman?

13:38.300 --> 13:40.270
Kind of.

13:40.310 --> 13:43.080
Principal Skidmore wants
us to find his talent.

13:43.110 --> 13:45.140
When is the right time to start
teaching a baby a skill?

13:47.510 --> 13:50.250
Well, that's something I can
speak to from experience.

13:53.390 --> 13:56.150
Come on, little rock star.

13:56.190 --> 13:59.090
Maybe you like the tambourine.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.260
Jingly.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.300
Well, at least it didn't
hurt as much as the cymbals.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.110
So, even though I showed no ability,

14:16.140 --> 14:20.280
you kept pushing me and pushing me
and I ended up a musical prodigy.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.250
What? No.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.220
That story was about Cameron.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.190
We tried teaching him all sorts of things.

14:27.220 --> 14:30.090
Only thing he was good at
was hitting me in the head.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.220
But we didn't put any pressure
on you and eventually

14:31.260 --> 14:34.160
you found your own passion.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.200
Wait a second.

14:38.230 --> 14:40.100
That's Cameron?
Yeah.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.200
Why is he wearing pink?

14:42.470 --> 14:44.440
Hand-me-downs
from your cousin Lyla.

14:44.470 --> 14:47.170
That princess onesie
fit him till he was five.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.290
I can't afford $200 for a webinar.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.490
Especially after I spent all
my money on these magic beans.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.290
I'll do it later, Mom!

15:07.330 --> 15:09.460
There's a boy from school coming over.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.170
Angus, where are you?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.310
I can't wait much longer.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.170
What does she see in him?

15:32.420 --> 15:33.190
Cameron?

15:39.260 --> 15:41.360
What are you doing here?

15:41.400 --> 15:44.130
I just wanted to learn
everything Angus knows.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.100
Watch him do his thing.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.270
You want to watch him fix my computer?

15:47.300 --> 15:50.370
And by "fix your computer," you mean...

15:50.410 --> 15:53.110
Fix my computer.

15:53.140 --> 15:54.280
He's going to fix my computer.

15:54.310 --> 15:56.150
That computer.
Over there.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.350
He's fixing it.

15:57.380 --> 16:00.250
Wait, what are you trying to say?

16:00.280 --> 16:02.380
I'm saying he's fixing my computer!

16:02.420 --> 16:04.190
What did you think that he...

16:05.290 --> 16:06.120
Where did that beanstalk come from?

16:13.460 --> 16:16.100
Who's my little deputy?

16:17.070 --> 16:19.230
Kuh...
Cuffs?

16:19.270 --> 16:20.340
You want the handcuffs?

16:20.370 --> 16:22.340
Okay.

16:23.470 --> 16:25.340
Hey!

16:27.480 --> 16:29.150
Nice one!

16:32.080 --> 16:32.480
Chyna, we're here for the baby.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.450
I'm counting two hostiles.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.450
You take the girl.
I'll take the old man!

16:40.290 --> 16:43.290
Please. I am a highly decorated
member of the San Francisco...

16:53.200 --> 16:55.100
What? I thought we
were breaking stuff.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.470
Guys, I'm not giving you the baby.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.180
He's too young for all this pressure.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.310
So you're saying we should just
go to Skidmore and tell her,

17:04.349 --> 17:06.319
"We failed. Punish us.

17:06.349 --> 17:08.220
"Lock us in detention for months
without anything fun to do

17:08.250 --> 17:12.060
"like homework or
extra credit assignments."

17:12.089 --> 17:15.230
That's not what I'm saying.
Don't put words in my mouth.

17:17.430 --> 17:20.260
Words in my mouth.
I have an idea!

17:21.130 --> 17:22.300
Come on, guys!

17:24.440 --> 17:27.200
Hey! Don't leave me
without any...

17:29.240 --> 17:31.340
Never mind. I'm good!

17:35.340 --> 17:38.150
Angus told you we were an item?

17:38.180 --> 17:40.320
I'm going to teach
that little twerp a lesson!

17:42.250 --> 17:43.320
I think that's Angus.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.050
Hello, Mrs. Reed.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.360
Would you mind watching my ham?

17:46.390 --> 17:48.460
Quick!
Get back in the closet!

17:48.490 --> 17:52.430
Wait. What?
But I'm scared of the clown statue.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.260
Hey, Lexi. I know
you didn't ask me to,

17:55.300 --> 17:57.230
but I'm going to install
this anti-virus software.

17:57.270 --> 18:00.100
Be sure to tell people at school

18:00.140 --> 18:02.440
I did everything you wanted and more.

18:02.470 --> 18:04.410
Use those exact words.

18:07.110 --> 18:09.350
Forget the computer.

18:09.380 --> 18:14.050
I thought you and I could
create some electricity.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.250
Okay.

18:18.420 --> 18:22.390
I guess we could rub our feet on the carpet

18:22.430 --> 18:23.160
and touch the doorknob.

18:25.130 --> 18:27.260
I meant kiss, silly.

18:30.070 --> 18:32.100
I'm just a little boy!

18:39.280 --> 18:42.350
That was awesome.

18:42.380 --> 18:45.250
Except for being locked in the closet
with that creepy clown statue.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.150
Clown statue?

18:48.190 --> 18:50.190
We don't have a clown statue.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.370
Oh, yeah.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.200
We do have a clown statue.

19:09.310 --> 19:12.040
Come on, I have to show you something!

19:12.080 --> 19:15.010
If it's the family of wombats
living under the deep fryer,

19:15.040 --> 19:18.380
you should know that
they're very clean animals

19:18.410 --> 19:21.220
and actually upped our health code rating

19:21.250 --> 19:23.350
by chasing away the dung beetles.

19:25.150 --> 19:27.220
No.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.090
But we did find Sebastian's talent.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.390
Hit it!

19:35.260 --> 19:38.060
<i>♪ I'm a baby</i>

19:38.100 --> 19:40.400

Principal Skidmore, I can explain.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.210
<i>♪ She can try,</i> <i>but it won't

20:17.510 --> 20:19.280
Get out of there!

20:22.350 --> 20:24.410
Not you, wombats!

20:27.250 --> 20:30.150
I'm sorry we tried to trick you,

20:30.190 --> 20:31.490
but we were just trying to make a point.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.420
We work really hard
in the A.N.T. Program,

20:33.460 --> 20:35.330
and it's rewarding,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.090
but we all chose to be a part of it.

20:37.130 --> 20:38.230
Not me.
My parents made me.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.470
The point is

20:43.500 --> 20:46.400
Sebastian is too young
for all that pressure.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.470
He should be allowed to be a baby,

20:48.510 --> 20:51.380
have fun, enjoy growing up.

20:51.410 --> 20:54.510
I insist that you take Sebastian
out of the A.N.T. Program.

20:54.550 --> 20:57.250
Sebastian is not an Ant.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.150
I just made the whole thing up

20:59.180 --> 21:01.250
so that I could get you
kids to babysit my nephew

21:01.290 --> 21:02.220
while I go shoe shopping.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.120
Your nephew?

21:06.160 --> 21:10.460
Trust me, my sister didn't
give birth to any prodigy.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.160
She's so dumb she entrusted me
with the safety of a child.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.700
Not it. Not it. Not it.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.700
Dang it!

21:26.610 --> 21:27.970
Hey Olive.

21:27.970 --> 21:29.280
What are you doing?

21:29.940 --> 21:32.730
Working on the next volume of my autobiography.

21:33.150 --> 21:36.010
Then Chyna came up to me and said:
"Hey Olive, what're you doing?"

21:36.470 --> 21:38.580
But I can see in her eyes that she don't really care.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.200
- Cool dog.
- You don't know that half of it.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.770
This is super advanced prodigy dog.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.910
Please, teach her a talent when I'm ***.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.550
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:51.550 --> 21:53.630
Forget it, we ar enot falling for your schemes...

21:55.410 --> 21:57.300
Bye bye. See ya.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.310
Man, watch their problem.

22:01.510 --> 22:02.710
