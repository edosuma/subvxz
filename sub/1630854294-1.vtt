00:05.200 --> 00:07.900
[Parker] <i>Nine years ago,</i>
<i>I came to the Yukon.</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:09.400
This is just the beginning.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.643
You know, I mean, that pan,
we're gonna be throwing

00:11.667 --> 00:13.667
thousands of those
through our plant every day.

00:15.100 --> 00:18.266
<i>The Klondike brings</i>
<i>all sorts of crazy people</i>
<i>together.</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:23.600
<i>I've seen a lot show up
trying to make their fortune.</i>

00:23.667 --> 00:25.500
<i>A lot of people
have come and gone...</i>

00:27.066 --> 00:28.266
but we're still here.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.460
<i>But gold miners are in
for a shock this year.</i>

00:36.800 --> 00:39.400
You know, you're paying more
for just about everything.

00:39.467 --> 00:43.600
<i>Inflation hit a 30-year high
last month.</i>

00:43.667 --> 00:45.800
[Parker] <i>The world's</i>
<i>all screwed up.</i>

00:45.867 --> 00:48.242
<i>Fuel prices are crazy.</i>

00:48.266 --> 00:50.343
<i>Spare parts are hard to find.</i>

00:50.367 --> 00:53.543
And crazy high gold prices
are gone.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.600
<i>One thing about these issues</i>
<i>is it's gonna burn</i>
<i>some people up.</i>

00:58.767 --> 01:00.767
<i>Tony Beets is struggling
with Red Tape.</i>

01:02.567 --> 01:05.242
<i>Fred, he's in the middle
of nowhere.</i>

01:05.266 --> 01:07.700
<i>Lack of experience
is going to hurt him.</i>

01:07.767 --> 01:11.367
<i>Rick Ness, rumor has it,
he's not even coming back.</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:19.767
<i>We have to hammer down
like never before.</i>

01:26.166 --> 01:30.867
<i>This season is going
to be our toughest season yet.</i>

01:38.500 --> 01:42.000
[Paul] <i>On the all-new season</i>
<i>of Gold Rush.</i>

01:43.767 --> 01:45.000
[Tony speaking]

01:56.000 --> 01:57.042
It's do or die this season.

01:57.066 --> 01:59.142
<i>And right now,
we are trying to survive.</i>

01:59.166 --> 02:01.000
[Tony speaking]

02:02.100 --> 02:04.100
We're hitting it
with everything we got.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.543
That's what
we've been waiting for.

02:05.567 --> 02:07.000
You're washing rocks.

02:09.367 --> 02:12.142
Parker has asked me
to come from Australia
to help him

02:12.166 --> 02:13.900
with his new Alaskan operation.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.867
If you need to stop
really fast, use this one.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
[man] This is like
the best pan I've ever had.

02:20.467 --> 02:21.543
Hey, miracles happen, right?

02:21.567 --> 02:22.700
Not in my world.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.443
What the [bleep] is going on
with the Hulk?

02:24.467 --> 02:26.000
[metal clanging]

02:27.100 --> 02:29.543
Oh, [bleep]!

02:29.567 --> 02:31.343
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop, stop.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.042
Get out of my face and leave.

02:33.066 --> 02:35.443
A lot of sacrifices go
into making this happen.

02:35.467 --> 02:36.767
This is hard.

02:38.467 --> 02:41.000
He's right at mine site.
Let him [bleep] work.

02:41.066 --> 02:43.100
[Tony speaking]

02:44.400 --> 02:46.743
Looks like Fairbanks
is [bleep] day one.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.200
[bleep] me.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.900
[man 1] One, two, three...

02:56.967 --> 02:58.643
[woman 1] Nine, ten.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.000
[man 2] Eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.743
[woman 2] Eighty, one hundred.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.100
One-ten, one-twenty.

03:06.166 --> 03:09.767
[woman 2] Two-forty,
two-fifty, two-sixty.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.543
- 448.95.
- [bleep] yeah.

03:13.567 --> 03:16.543
Fifty thousand ounces of gold.

03:16.567 --> 03:18.867
- Whoo!
- Fifty down. Fifty to go.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.000
[wind howling]

03:42.867 --> 03:44.266
Snow is very deep.

03:46.266 --> 03:48.343
It's the most snow
since I started
lining up here,

03:48.367 --> 03:50.643
you know what, nine years ago.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.100
[Paul] <i>Parker Schnabel came</i>
<i>to the Klondike</i>

03:53.166 --> 03:55.100
<i>at just 18 years old.</i>

03:55.166 --> 04:01.000
<i>Since then, he's pulled</i>
<i>over 45,000 ounces of gold</i>
<i>out of the ground,</i>

04:01.066 --> 04:05.500
<i>today worth $86 million.</i>

04:05.567 --> 04:10.900
<i>Now, at the ripe old age
of 27, he's planning his exit.</i>

04:10.967 --> 04:13.007
[Parker] <i>It's looking like</i>
<i>this season's going to be</i>

04:13.066 --> 04:16.000
<i>massively different
than the last few.</i>

04:16.066 --> 04:18.242
<i>We're in a brave new world.</i>

04:18.266 --> 04:21.943
[Paul] <i>The Klondike Parker</i>
<i>knew years ago is changing.</i>

04:21.967 --> 04:27.543
<i>All the best ground is taken,</i>
<i>and restrictions</i>
<i>are increasing.</i>

04:27.567 --> 04:30.100
[Parker] <i>With the state</i>
<i>of permitting right now,</i>

04:30.166 --> 04:32.206
<i>you know,</i>
<i>everybody's businesses</i>
<i>are at serious risk.</i>

04:34.667 --> 04:37.600
[Paul] <i>To keep</i>
<i>his gold mining dreams alive,</i>

04:37.667 --> 04:41.867
<i>Parker's expanding,
opening a new claim in Alaska.</i>

04:43.667 --> 04:45.643
[Parker] <i>We are going to Alaska,</i>

04:45.667 --> 04:47.867
<i>and we are setting up
a new operation over there.</i>

04:50.100 --> 04:53.076
<i>The biggest challenge</i>
<i>this year is gonna be</i>
<i>figuring out</i>

04:53.100 --> 04:57.242
<i>how to manage two mine sites
in different countries.</i>

04:57.266 --> 04:58.509
<i>There's a lot of money at risk.</i>

04:58.533 --> 05:01.000
It's really difficult
surviving
those kind of expansions.

05:05.667 --> 05:09.800
[Paul] <i>But first, he's staging</i>
<i>a Klondike blitz.</i>

05:09.867 --> 05:13.242
[Parker] <i>Getting things</i>
<i>going here at Scribner</i>
<i>is now the main focus.</i>

05:13.266 --> 05:15.242
<i>We've got a lot to do.</i>

05:15.266 --> 05:17.142
<i>You know, when you start
adding up all the projects,</i>

05:17.166 --> 05:18.467
<i>it sounds like a hell of a lot.</i>

05:19.900 --> 05:21.900
[Paul] <i>To add</i>
<i>even more pressure,</i>

05:21.967 --> 05:24.443
<i>Parker's losing
his main water license</i>

05:24.467 --> 05:28.743
<i>on his gold-rich airstrip
claim at the end of the year.</i>

05:28.767 --> 05:29.943
[Parker]
There's no wiggle room.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.343
You know, normally
with mining, it's like,

05:31.367 --> 05:33.500
"Oh, what you don't get done,

05:33.567 --> 05:35.400
you just can do
the next season."

05:35.467 --> 05:38.100
On this ground, this season,
there is no next season.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.443
Any gold that
we leave in the ground

05:39.467 --> 05:40.743
is probably staying there.

05:40.767 --> 05:42.266
So we need to get it all done.

05:43.567 --> 05:46.743
[Paul] <i>With fuel prices</i>
<i>rising to record highs</i>

05:46.767 --> 05:50.800
<i>and the supply chain that</i>
<i>feeds his operations</i>
<i>in tatters,</i>

05:50.867 --> 05:52.600
<i>there's no margin for error.</i>

05:53.800 --> 05:56.643
<i>But that's not stopping
the young mine boss.</i>

05:56.667 --> 06:01.000
[Parker] The big thing for me
is that I really like
to push ourselves

06:01.467 --> 06:05.443
and find more gold each year,
like last year
was a huge season.

06:05.467 --> 06:08.767
<i>But I think we might be able
to have a 10,000-ounce season.</i>

06:10.567 --> 06:12.807
<i>Oh, but it looks like</i>
<i>they're getting</i>
<i>some stripping done.</i>

06:15.100 --> 06:16.667
<i>I'm guessing that's Tyson.</i>

06:23.967 --> 06:25.042
How's it goin'?

06:25.066 --> 06:26.200
Pretty good. You, man?

06:26.266 --> 06:27.843
Oh, not bad.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.400
- You guys have been busy.
- Yeah.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.227
Camp's sorted.
And now out we're moving dirt.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.876
Looks like it.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.900
[Paul] <i>Plant boss Tyson</i>
<i>Lee is getting a jump</i>
<i>on stripping the airstrip,</i>

06:37.967 --> 06:43.743
<i>a chunk of ground that has</i>
<i>brought in over $9 million</i>
<i>worth of gold so far.</i>

06:43.767 --> 06:47.200
[Parker] Okay. So you guys
are just gonna plug away here,

06:47.266 --> 06:49.800
so you might just leave it,
like leave the snow

06:49.867 --> 06:52.076
from where that line is forward,

06:52.100 --> 06:54.543
just leave it undisturbed
and just carry this stuff up,

06:54.567 --> 06:56.543
corner it out
up that way, you know?

06:56.567 --> 06:58.743
Don't want the ramp turning
into [bleep] halfway through.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.443
[Parker] No. And
that's what's going to happen.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.787
So the line with Tony must be
right in here somewhere, huh?

07:03.967 --> 07:05.743
Yeah, it's pretty close.

07:05.767 --> 07:10.700
[Paul] <i>Parker leases</i>
<i>all the claims at the airstrip</i>
<i>except for two.</i>

07:10.767 --> 07:13.600
<i>Those are owned
by Klondike kingpin</i>

07:13.667 --> 07:16.767
<i>and long-time frenemy
Tony Beets.</i>

07:18.266 --> 07:20.242
[Parker] Okay. Where is he?

07:20.266 --> 07:21.643
Tony?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.242
I believe at the Hill.

07:23.266 --> 07:24.800
He hasn't got anything out here?

07:24.867 --> 07:26.242
No, I haven't seen him.

07:26.266 --> 07:28.142
- Obviously, it doesn't
look like...
- Brought a couple of trucks

07:28.166 --> 07:29.543
out the other day,
but other than that...

07:29.567 --> 07:31.767
Wait, so he's moving equipment
out of Indian River Camp?

07:32.667 --> 07:33.767
Yeah.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.443
That doesn't make any sense.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.100
[Tyson] Not much does with him.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.743
Like we've done better
and better the further
downstream we've gone.

07:48.767 --> 07:51.643
The license is going to expire
with the gold in the ground.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.767
I'll go talk to him.

07:59.266 --> 08:01.000
<i>I'm just gonna go sit down
with Tony</i>

08:01.166 --> 08:02.843
and see what his plan is

08:02.867 --> 08:04.543
because if he's not gonna
mine it,

08:04.567 --> 08:08.743
then I'll probably ask him
if we can.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.900
You know, Tony and I
have always had a bit
of a rocky relationship.

08:11.967 --> 08:15.667
But then, like, would
we be where we are
if Tony hadn't given us,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.242
you know, a chance
in the beginning

08:18.266 --> 08:20.400
when we first showed up
in the Yukon?

08:20.467 --> 08:21.567
Probably not.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.242
Truth is he's helped us
out a lot.

08:24.266 --> 08:26.100
That's worth something, I guess.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
[Tony speaking]

08:31.967 --> 08:34.643
[Paul] <i>Tony had been mining</i>
<i>for 30 years...</i>

08:34.667 --> 08:36.443
[Tony speaking]

08:36.467 --> 08:38.800
[Paul] <i>...when he gave</i>
<i>the 18-year-old a shot...</i>

08:38.867 --> 08:39.900
[Tony speaking]

08:39.967 --> 08:41.800
[Paul] <i>...when no one else</i>
<i>would.</i>

08:41.867 --> 08:44.100
[Tony] 140.65.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.042
[Paul] <i>And it paid off</i>
<i>for both of them.</i>

08:47.066 --> 08:48.500
[Tony speaking]

08:50.300 --> 08:54.142
[Paul] <i>But as the stakes</i>
<i>got higher, egos collided.</i>

08:54.166 --> 08:56.367
[Tony speaking]

08:57.767 --> 08:59.543
Just show up in the spring
and shutting us down?

08:59.567 --> 09:01.000
[Tony speaking]

09:03.867 --> 09:05.076
Tony won't talk today.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.300
Have a judge tell me that, Tony.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.843
[Paul] <i>Climaxing</i>
<i>in an explosive battle</i>

09:09.867 --> 09:13.242
<i>over mining the airstrip
that Tony owns...</i>

09:13.266 --> 09:14.476
[Tony speaking]

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
[Paul] <i>...that Parker</i>
<i>holds the water license on.</i>

09:16.567 --> 09:19.400
Give me one good reason
not to tell you to go
[bleep] yourself.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.200
Well, the last few years,
I don't know, it's been weird.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.843
[Paul] <i>Now Parker</i>
<i>finds himself once again</i>

09:30.867 --> 09:32.947
<i>trying to broker a deal
with the king of the Klondike</i>

09:34.066 --> 09:36.567
<i>over this long-disputed piece
of land.</i>

09:40.200 --> 09:42.400
- [Parker] Tony.
- [Tony speaking]

09:42.467 --> 09:43.843
- Hi.
- [Tony speaking]

09:43.867 --> 09:44.943
[Parker] How are you?

09:44.967 --> 09:46.443
- [Tony speaking]
- Good. How are you?

09:46.467 --> 09:47.643
- [Tony speaking]
- Good to see you.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.443
[Tony speaking]

09:49.467 --> 09:51.100
- It was good.
- [Tony speaking]

09:51.166 --> 09:54.100
- I got COVID.
- [Tony speaking]

09:54.166 --> 09:56.076
Have you heard from Rick Ness?

09:56.100 --> 09:57.266
[Tony speaking]

10:09.600 --> 10:11.520
- [Parker] How was your winter?
- [Tony speaking]

10:18.467 --> 10:20.976
You've got... you've still got
a lot of years left
in you, Tony.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.467
[Tony speaking]

10:35.667 --> 10:39.343
Are you gonna, like,
get old and grumpy
or are you gonna get...

10:39.367 --> 10:41.000
[Tony speaking]

10:48.867 --> 10:50.100
No, Minnie will kill you.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.743
[Tony speaking]

10:54.767 --> 10:57.543
I know Minnie well enough
to know that you would
not get away with that.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.066
[Tony speaking]

11:06.967 --> 11:09.142
- Not great.
- [Tony speaking]

11:09.166 --> 11:10.643
I mean, it's...
Yeah, it's... you know,

11:10.667 --> 11:13.242
well, everything that's good
is either tied up
or been mined, right?

11:13.266 --> 11:16.643
- [Tony speaking]
- [Parker] Right.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.076
And the scary thing is now
they're starting to get it.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.943
[Tony speaking]

11:21.967 --> 11:23.343
We have a lot going on.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.327
That's part of the reason
I wanted to talk to you.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.843
Right now, we're stripping up
to your line...

11:28.867 --> 11:30.300
Mm-hmm.

11:30.367 --> 11:33.047
And you've still got
a couple of claims
on the bottom end of that.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.900
But I don't see...

11:37.967 --> 11:39.700
you haven't been out there
at all.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.200
[Tony speaking]

12:04.500 --> 12:06.567
[Parker] So are you open
to us mining it?

12:12.300 --> 12:14.000
[Tony speaking]

12:24.300 --> 12:25.400
Okay.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.100
[Tony speaking]

12:32.567 --> 12:35.076
And then do you think
for those two claims

12:35.100 --> 12:37.743
we could have them just
a flat royalty

12:37.767 --> 12:42.166
at 15% rather than
applying to like that
sliding royalty scale?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.367
[Tony speaking]

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
- [Parker] Right.
- [Tony speaking]

12:56.100 --> 12:57.900
[Parker] Okay.

12:57.967 --> 12:59.900
We'll do our best
to get that done.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.527
I can't promise
we'll get it all, but...

13:02.667 --> 13:04.600
[Tony speaking]

13:04.667 --> 13:06.242
[Parker] ...we're going
to sure as hell try.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.943
All right. Well, that sounds
like a deal to you.

13:08.967 --> 13:10.900
[Tony speaking]

13:10.967 --> 13:12.242
I better go get to work.

13:12.266 --> 13:15.242
[Tony speaking]

13:15.266 --> 13:16.567
Thanks, Tony.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.500
[Tony speaking]

13:26.767 --> 13:28.443
[Parker] That's the result
we were looking for.

13:28.467 --> 13:31.147
But I think we kind of just
doubled our workload
for the season here.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.343
[Paul] <i>Before he even</i>
<i>steps foot in Alaska</i>

13:36.367 --> 13:39.600
<i>and despite already
being stretched thin,</i>

13:39.667 --> 13:41.900
<i>Parker's just
secured more ground</i>

13:41.967 --> 13:44.367
<i>than he's ever mined
in one season.</i>

13:53.767 --> 13:55.767
[Tony speaking]

13:56.867 --> 13:58.409
[Paul] <i>Forty years ago,</i>

13:58.433 --> 14:01.000
<i>Tony left the Netherlands</i>
<i>seeking his fortune</i>
<i>in the Klondike.</i>

14:06.467 --> 14:09.667
[Tony speaking]

14:12.900 --> 14:14.600
[Paul] <i>Over three decades,</i>

14:14.667 --> 14:17.843
<i>he's built a gold mining
empire from nothing.</i>

14:17.867 --> 14:22.076
<i>Last season,</i>
<i>he invested millions</i>
<i>on monster machines</i>

14:22.100 --> 14:25.000
<i>to continue expanding
on the Indian River.</i>

14:25.066 --> 14:27.343
<i>But those plans were trashed</i>

14:27.367 --> 14:29.743
<i>when he couldn't secure
a permit.</i>

14:29.767 --> 14:31.000
[Tony speaking]

14:40.000 --> 14:41.133
I know.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.100
[Paul] <i>Now, to hang on</i>
<i>to what he's built,</i>

14:46.166 --> 14:48.200
<i>he faces the battle
of a lifetime.</i>

14:49.400 --> 14:51.000
[Tony speaking]

15:15.967 --> 15:18.000
[Paul] <i>Hemmed in by regulations,</i>

15:18.066 --> 15:21.843
<i>Tony's only option
for gold is Paradise Hill</i>

15:21.867 --> 15:26.000
<i>and he needs to be digging</i>
<i>paydirt in two weeks</i>
<i>to hit his target.</i>

15:27.300 --> 15:28.843
<i>But there's a problem.</i>

15:28.867 --> 15:31.000
<i>His path to the claim is blocked</i>

15:31.467 --> 15:33.667
<i>by the deepest snow on record.</i>

15:36.500 --> 15:37.843
[Mike] <i>I hate snow right now</i>

15:37.867 --> 15:40.200
'cause every time you remove
the snow, it snows again.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.000
[bleep] [bleep].

15:42.066 --> 15:43.643
There's so much of the [bleep]
this year

15:43.667 --> 15:45.843
that we had a [bleep] problem
finding places to put it.

15:45.867 --> 15:47.743
[Paul] <i>Tony's put</i>
<i>youngest son, Mike,</i>

15:47.767 --> 15:49.843
<i>in charge of the startup crew</i>

15:49.867 --> 15:53.900
<i>and clearing snow and ice</i>
<i>from the only access road</i>
<i>to the site.</i>

15:53.967 --> 15:56.000
<i>There's very few people
my dad can trust</i>

15:56.066 --> 15:58.400
to do this job
because someone else,

15:58.467 --> 16:00.843
if it starts to slide,
they'll panic

16:00.867 --> 16:02.107
<i>and they'll do something stupid</i>

16:02.467 --> 16:04.000
that they're not supposed to,

16:04.066 --> 16:06.600
and they can get themselves
seriously injured.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.142
<i>If I get killed
on the mine site,</i>

16:08.166 --> 16:09.743
who's my mommy
and daddy gonna sue?

16:09.767 --> 16:11.600
My mommy and daddy?

16:11.667 --> 16:13.627
<i>That's why I can get away
with a lot more [bleep].</i>

16:19.667 --> 16:21.300
[man] <i>Mike, you copy? Mike.</i>

16:22.467 --> 16:23.700
Yeah.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.967
[man] <i>I got stuck</i>
<i>in a snowbank with the loader.</i>

16:28.300 --> 16:29.900
[man] <i>Can you come</i>
<i>and have a look at it?</i>

16:38.700 --> 16:40.343
Loader operator got
a little too vigorous

16:40.367 --> 16:43.066
and went a little too far,
found a hole.

16:45.066 --> 16:48.242
[Paul] <i>To haul</i>
<i>the 38-ton loader out...</i>

16:48.266 --> 16:50.643
It's sitting right on ice.
You can't do jack [bleep].

16:50.667 --> 16:55.543
[Paul] <i>...Mike brings</i>
<i>in the 18-ton D6 dozer.</i>

16:55.567 --> 16:56.800
Let's go.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.200
You ready to go backwards?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.242
You're in there good.

17:19.266 --> 17:20.976
You're on ice.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
So you got about
as much traction as a [bleep]

17:23.066 --> 17:25.000
trying to climb a hill.

17:25.066 --> 17:27.443
Gonna need something
a little bit heavier.

17:27.467 --> 17:31.000
The ground
in front of us is frozen,
so it's no traction.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.943
And we need to get
something with a little bit
more weight than the D6,

17:34.967 --> 17:36.943
<i>so I'm thinking of the grader</i>

17:36.967 --> 17:38.443
'cause the grader
will have nice traction,

17:38.467 --> 17:40.343
but it'll also have quite
a decent amount of weight
on it.

17:40.367 --> 17:42.127
But I don't know
if it'll have enough either.

17:44.367 --> 17:50.567
[Paul] <i>Mike ups the ante</i>
<i>with a 28-ton</i>
<i>275 horsepower grader.</i>

18:06.467 --> 18:08.900
[Tony] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.400
[Tony speaking]

19:03.867 --> 19:06.242
[Paul] <i>Tony's plan, weigh down</i>

19:06.266 --> 19:09.600
<i>a 31-ton rock truck
with heavy overburden</i>

19:09.667 --> 19:13.242
<i>to create a 67-ton monster.</i>

19:13.266 --> 19:14.700
[Tony speaking]

20:08.600 --> 20:10.142
[Parker] Thanks for being here.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.343
Big job ahead of us.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.543
Yeah, there's a lot of work.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.500
[Paul] <i>After striking a deal</i>
<i>with Tony Beets,</i>

20:16.567 --> 20:21.200
<i>Parker Schnabel now needs</i>
<i>to mine more ground</i>
<i>than ever before,</i>

20:21.266 --> 20:24.400
<i>and he has to do it before
the end of the season.</i>

20:24.467 --> 20:26.900
[Parker] This spring is gonna
be what sets us up for,

20:26.967 --> 20:28.943
you know, if we can get it
done by the fall or not.

20:28.967 --> 20:31.400
So let's just give it our best

20:31.467 --> 20:32.907
and let's see
if we can get her done.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.643
[Paul] <i>To take on Tony's ground,</i>

20:40.667 --> 20:43.667
<i>Parker's mobilizing
his entire operation</i>

20:43.734 --> 20:46.500
<i>to strip the extra 45 acres</i>

20:46.567 --> 20:49.867
<i>and wants to be pulling
in gold in just a week.</i>

20:51.767 --> 20:53.300
[Parker] Let's make it happen.

20:55.266 --> 21:00.166
[Paul] <i>Parker leads</i>
<i>from the front</i>
<i>in his 73-ton D10 dozer.</i>

21:02.734 --> 21:04.767
[Parker] <i>Let's mine</i>
<i>some [bleep] gold.</i>

21:13.967 --> 21:16.543
Best way to figure out
how to manage a bunch
of different projects at once

21:16.567 --> 21:18.000
is probably
just go start doing it.

21:27.266 --> 21:30.667
With my grandpa back
in the '40s and '50s,

21:30.734 --> 21:33.334
he managed a whole bunch
of different logging camps
all over Alaska

21:34.834 --> 21:38.843
and how they didn't have
Internet or sat phones
or anything.

21:38.867 --> 21:40.567
So I don't know how he did it.

21:43.266 --> 21:48.266
[Paul] <i>Parker already</i>
<i>has 45 acres of ground</i>
<i>to mine at the airstrip.</i>

21:49.767 --> 21:54.100
<i>By adding Tony's 45,
he's now up to 90 acres,</i>

21:55.266 --> 21:58.266
<i>50% more than
he mined last year.</i>

22:02.567 --> 22:04.943
<i>If he can get through it all,</i>

22:04.967 --> 22:08.767
<i>he could beat last season's
$15 million total.</i>

22:14.266 --> 22:16.626
[Parker] Keep going ahead
and swing her in tight
to the bank.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.734
Straddle that bank.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.242
[Paul] <i>Across the claim,</i>

22:22.266 --> 22:25.600
<i>Tyson Lee is digging ditches
and building berms</i>

22:25.667 --> 22:29.343
<i>in the 480 excavator
in the pre-stripped ground</i>

22:29.367 --> 22:31.000
<i>nearest to the Indian River.</i>

22:32.834 --> 22:35.400
[Tyson] This year,
we had a record snowfall.

22:35.467 --> 22:39.643
So we're having a lot
of melting snow
coming into our cut.

22:39.667 --> 22:43.000
<i>We've got to get this ditch in
and armor up the riverbank</i>

22:43.066 --> 22:46.467
<i>before the Indian River</i>
<i>is flooding into us</i>
<i>like none other.</i>

22:47.867 --> 22:50.076
I've seen people lose
entire cuts

22:50.100 --> 22:51.667
because they don't have
good drainage.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.243
[metal clanging]

23:13.267 --> 23:14.500
Oh, [bleep].

23:21.100 --> 23:22.667
The [bleep] is going on?

23:27.300 --> 23:29.976
Hey, Jordan,
you got a copy, Jordan?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.960
Yeah, man, looks like one
of the pins in the truck
on the 480 snapped on me.

23:35.867 --> 23:38.443
It's the last thing
we need right now.

23:38.467 --> 23:43.543
[Paul] <i>A broken pin</i>
<i>has stopped Tyson's</i>
<i>ditching in its tracks.</i>

23:43.567 --> 23:46.843
[Parker] You know,
these pins, they hold
each segment together.

23:46.867 --> 23:48.400
It's like a zipper.

23:48.467 --> 23:51.767
One of the links
in the zipper broke,
and now I can't use it.

23:57.166 --> 24:02.000
[Paul] <i>The 58-ton excavator's</i>
<i>35-foot track</i>
<i>is made up of links</i>

24:02.367 --> 24:05.300
<i>held together
by 52 coupling pins.</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:09.843
<i>One has snapped,</i>

24:09.867 --> 24:12.467
<i>causing the track to slip off
its rollers...</i>

24:14.467 --> 24:17.500
<i>and the tensioning idler
to drop out of position.</i>

24:19.266 --> 24:24.343
<i>To fix, the idler must be put
back into its housing,</i>

24:24.367 --> 24:29.100
<i>the track pulled</i>
<i>on to the frame,</i>
<i>and the pin replaced.</i>

24:37.667 --> 24:39.000
Just got to pull
the track up over

24:39.066 --> 24:41.166
so we can just put it
all back together right here.

25:04.867 --> 25:06.767
That's a broken pin there.
That's a broken one.

25:08.166 --> 25:11.600
[Paul] <i>Before they can secure</i>
<i>the track back onto the frame,</i>

25:11.667 --> 25:15.843
<i>mechanic Jordan Sands needs
to guide the tensioning idler</i>

25:15.867 --> 25:17.600
<i>back into its housing.</i>

25:17.667 --> 25:19.567
- [Jordan] Hey, Tyson.
- Tyson!

25:21.100 --> 25:22.710
[Jordan] Man, can you
just push on the idler.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.300
We're just going to crack
the adjuster.

25:24.367 --> 25:25.810
You can just ease into it
with the blades

25:25.834 --> 25:28.394
- instead of trying to push
on it with the bucket.
- [Tyson] Okay.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.000
[Paul] <i>Tyson must maneuver</i>
<i>the 19-foot dozer blade</i>

25:33.467 --> 25:35.467
<i>with pinpoint accuracy.</i>

25:37.000 --> 25:38.443
He's going to push
the idler in for us.

25:38.467 --> 25:40.343
So it's back in its little slot.

25:40.367 --> 25:43.667
Jordon's in there with a bar
trying to hold it up,

25:43.734 --> 25:47.443
and he just needs me to push
on the idler very gently

25:47.467 --> 25:49.343
while he's trying to line it up.

25:49.367 --> 25:51.000
And I can't see anything.

25:51.066 --> 25:53.567
So I'm solely relying
on Jordan right now.

25:58.266 --> 25:59.710
Very delicate process.

25:59.734 --> 26:02.000
You know, a D10 would push
this whole over sideways.

26:12.567 --> 26:13.667
Hang on.

26:22.266 --> 26:23.567
Back off a little bit.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.643
[Jordan]
Grab your right clutch

26:31.667 --> 26:32.987
and just steer over
like this far.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.100
Bit more.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.367
In the hole, boy.

26:48.834 --> 26:50.843
[Paul] <i>For the final part</i>
<i>of the fix,</i>

26:50.867 --> 26:53.343
<i>Jordan must get
the replacement pin</i>

26:53.367 --> 26:55.100
<i>through the holes in the track.</i>

27:03.567 --> 27:04.667
Let's go.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.076
Go on.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.100
Hooked up.
She tightened up with grease.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.076
Good to dig dirt, make money.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.076
[Paul] <i>Tyson and the 480</i>
<i>are back in the game</i>

27:15.100 --> 27:19.843
<i>digging ditches before</i>
<i>the melt delivers any flooding</i>
<i>into the cut.</i>

27:19.867 --> 27:22.142
It's like it's all back
together working...

27:22.166 --> 27:23.343
working as it should,

27:23.367 --> 27:26.266
so that's why we have the best
mechanics in the Klondike.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.100
[Fred] <i>We're taking</i>
<i>a huge gamble.</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:49.543
There is no safety net.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.142
It's a lot more real
for us this season.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.343
We've put everything
we have into this.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.200
We're not relying
on outside sources.

27:55.266 --> 27:56.976
This is all us.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.200
[Paul] <i>Military veteran</i>
<i>Fred Lewis</i>

27:59.266 --> 28:01.810
<i>is gearing up
for another battle.</i>

28:01.834 --> 28:03.274
<i>In the midst
of a precarious economy,</i>

28:04.467 --> 28:08.242
<i>Fred's refinanced his home
in the hope of him</i>

28:08.266 --> 28:10.710
<i>and his crew striking it rich.</i>

28:10.734 --> 28:12.343
[Fred] <i>I started this all</i>
<i>to help veterans,</i>

28:12.367 --> 28:14.100
<i>and that's still
my long-term goal.</i>

28:14.166 --> 28:16.000
I'm doing this
for my band of brothers.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.767
[Paul] <i>Tapped out of cash,</i>

28:19.834 --> 28:25.000
<i>there's no way back</i>
<i>for Fred if he doesn't find</i>
<i>gold this year.</i>

28:26.266 --> 28:28.710
So I've set a goal for this
season of 500 ounces.

28:28.734 --> 28:32.000
It sounds like a big jump
from our last season total
of 110,

28:32.166 --> 28:33.834
but that's what we need.

28:36.266 --> 28:39.810
[Paul] <i>After just six ounces</i>
<i>in his first season,</i>

28:39.834 --> 28:42.076
<i>Fred hit his stride
in his second.</i>

28:42.100 --> 28:43.810
Not only did we do it,
we beat it.

28:43.834 --> 28:44.900
I can't believe it.

28:44.967 --> 28:48.242
[Paul] <i>Banking 110 ounces</i>
<i>and breaking even.</i>

28:48.266 --> 28:49.567
Whoa.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.567
But costly disasters.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.042
[Fred] This one's done
for the season.

28:56.066 --> 28:59.100
[Paul] <i>...left him needing</i>
<i>more cash to start the season.</i>

29:05.100 --> 29:07.600
Now I've got my claws sunk
so deep into this,

29:07.667 --> 29:09.343
I think, at this point,

29:09.367 --> 29:10.976
I would take just about any risk

29:11.000 --> 29:13.242
if I thought
it was feasible to overcome.

29:13.266 --> 29:15.100
So we're going for it.

29:17.867 --> 29:22.242
[Paul] <i>Fred's claim</i>
<i>lies 46 miles west</i>
<i>of Dawson City,</i>

29:22.266 --> 29:24.042
<i>deep in the wilderness.</i>

29:24.066 --> 29:27.567
<i>To get there, he must cross
the mighty Yukon River.</i>

29:44.467 --> 29:47.343
[Fred] <i>This is the first look</i>
<i>I've gotten at the river</i>
<i>this season.</i>

29:47.367 --> 29:49.242
<i>I expect it to be way less
than this.</i>

29:49.266 --> 29:51.076
<i>Right now, we're looking
at several...</i>

29:51.100 --> 29:53.900
I mean, maybe even over a week
for this to be broken.

29:53.967 --> 29:56.643
And then they've got to get
all the big ice cleared
from upstream,

29:56.667 --> 29:58.643
has to pass down.

29:58.667 --> 29:59.767
This is bad.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.667
[Paul] <i>For four months</i>
<i>of winter,</i>

30:01.734 --> 30:03.574
<i>an ice road over the river
has connected Dawson</i>

30:04.567 --> 30:07.200
<i>with a highway to Fred's claim.</i>

30:07.266 --> 30:11.266
<i>But as the snow and ice melt,
it's too dangerous to cross.</i>

30:12.467 --> 30:15.500
<i>With precious little time
to get on the gold,</i>

30:15.567 --> 30:18.767
<i>Fred's forced to wait
for the ice to break up</i>

30:18.834 --> 30:21.343
<i>and the ferry to start running.</i>

30:21.367 --> 30:24.900
We have this 200-meter stretch
of river we can't cross.

30:24.967 --> 30:27.843
So right now, can't do anything,

30:27.867 --> 30:30.843
can't go to our claim,
can't get anything set up

30:30.867 --> 30:32.387
until Mother Nature
let's go of winter.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.843
<i>It's a horrible start.</i>

30:35.867 --> 30:37.166
<i>I mean, this is just a mess.</i>

30:45.867 --> 30:47.867
[Tony speaking]

30:55.266 --> 30:57.443
[Paul] <i>Two days</i>

the snow</i>

30:59.934 --> 31:02.467
<i>and they're ready to start
mining for gold.</i>

31:04.667 --> 31:05.867
<i>But first...</i>

31:07.934 --> 31:09.000

[Paul] <i>...Tony gathers</i>

-Look who's here.
Is that Grandpa?
-[Tony speaking]

31:23.500 --> 31:25.142
Like we never left, Tony.

31:25.166 --> 31:27.142
- [Tony speaking]
- Some things got
a little bigger.

31:27.166 --> 31:28.767
[Tony speaking]

31:31.166 --> 31:32.767
[Mike] So what's the plan
this year?

31:32.834 --> 31:34.967
[Tony speaking]

31:40.600 --> 31:41.943
[Mike] I thought
we had that lined up.

31:41.967 --> 31:45.000
[Tony speaking]

32:02.867 --> 32:04.100
How deep are you going?

32:04.166 --> 32:06.166
[Tony speaking]

32:11.000 --> 32:12.467
- That's deep.
- [Tony speaking]

32:29.367 --> 32:33.166
<i>To hunt it down,</i>
<i>he's going to dig deeper</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

32:34.767 --> 32:38.142
<i>First, he'll start by opening
the cold cut,</i>

32:38.166 --> 32:40.766
<i>a sprawling 9-acre site</i>
<i>where he hopes to find</i>
<i>paydirt at 130 feet.</i>

32:46.834 --> 32:52.343
<i>100 yards away,</i>
<i>he'll chase the pay streak</i>
<i>as it rises to 30 feet</i>

32:52.367 --> 32:53.967
<i>by opening the blue cut.</i>

32:59.567 --> 33:01.343
<i>With fuel costs rising,</i>

33:01.367 --> 33:04.567
<i>it'll cost millions just
to get down, to pay.</i>

33:09.767 --> 33:10.910
What we have planned here,

33:10.934 --> 33:12.242
we'll have lots of ground
to pull from.

33:12.266 --> 33:13.343
- [Tony speaking]
- Yeah.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.943
- [Tony speaking]
- Whether they have the gold

33:14.967 --> 33:16.867
in the ground though,
that's a different story.

33:17.934 --> 33:19.443
Clearly, that's where
the gold is.

33:19.467 --> 33:20.710
Gotcha.

33:20.734 --> 33:24.100
[Tony speaking]

33:31.867 --> 33:32.910
Mm-hmm.

33:32.934 --> 33:34.266
[Tony speaking]

33:44.166 --> 33:45.543
Who says that?

33:45.567 --> 33:46.810
No one says that.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.200
[Tony speaking]

34:00.166 --> 34:01.242
Oh, Lord.

34:01.266 --> 34:02.710
Yeah, you better get
a lot of gold mined

34:02.734 --> 34:04.834
because otherwise we
cannot afford auction sales.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
[Tony speaking]

34:09.567 --> 34:11.367
- We'll see you guys later.

y'all are rock truck drivers.

34:49.467 --> 34:52.543
Lisa and James, you two
are gonna be on the 750s.

34:52.567 --> 34:54.400
Ruby, you're gonna be
on the 950.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.443
Mike, you're gonna be
my co-dozer.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.100
<i>My dozer's blocking the road.</i>

34:58.166 --> 35:01.000
We're gonna treat it
like a hull breach
in a ship in space.

35:01.066 --> 35:02.943
I'm gonna go first
and everyone on the outside

35:02.967 --> 35:04.443
is going to slowly come in
with me.

35:04.467 --> 35:06.367
[Tony speaking]

35:09.266 --> 35:11.867
[Paul] <i>Tony wants to hit</i>

35:58.567 --> 36:01.343
[Mike] <i>We're literally</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:03.242
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>what they're doing.</i>
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

36:03.266 --> 36:06.300
Just go, go, go, go, go
and be like clockwork.

36:06.367 --> 36:08.710
I mean, we seem to have
a pretty good crew
so far this year,

36:08.734 --> 36:09.734
hopefully it'll be good.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.867
We're all just trying to work
together in this chaos.

36:19.767 --> 36:21.600
<i>This year, we have
so many new excavators,</i>

36:21.667 --> 36:24.300
so many new trucks,
so much other equipment,

36:24.367 --> 36:25.767
so much more than we used to.

36:27.567 --> 36:28.743
<i>My dad says he's going to let me</i>

36:28.767 --> 36:31.142
<i>and Kevin take charge,
which will be good</i>

36:31.166 --> 36:32.643
'cause he's also not always
running around

36:32.667 --> 36:34.042
like a chicken
with its head cut off.

36:34.066 --> 36:37.242
I feel we can expand
even further, do more.

36:37.266 --> 36:39.000
<i>He likes to micromanage.
I don't blame him.</i>

36:39.767 --> 36:42.600
<i>He didn't become</i>
<i>this successful</i>
<i>from relying on others,</i>

36:42.667 --> 36:45.266
so it makes it very hard
for him to do that.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.943
[Ruby] <i>I think Mike's going</i>
<i>to do a great job.</i>

36:48.967 --> 36:51.710
He's been doing it already
since he was he was young.

36:51.734 --> 36:54.710
And as long as he can keep
that balance between operating

36:54.734 --> 36:57.543
and also making sure
that everything
is running efficiently

36:57.567 --> 37:00.042
and everybody's doing
their job properly,

37:00.066 --> 37:01.266
<i>I don't see it going wrong.</i>

37:05.000 --> 37:07.300
[Tony speaking]

37:40.300 --> 37:42.667
[Fred] This is a big
frickin' deal,

37:42.734 --> 37:45.200

anything like this.

Come over here.
Slide a little more.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.443

38:31.467 --> 38:32.934

38:34.767 --> 38:36.600
- [alarm blares]
- Listen.

38:39.967 --> 38:41.567
It is official.

38:47.467 --> 38:49.343
A lot of work ahead,
but this is the first step

38:49.367 --> 38:51.042
to getting us
across the river, so...

38:51.066 --> 38:52.767
- [boy] Oh, no, no.
- It's go time.

39:08.567 --> 39:10.727
You can see the massive
amounts of ice
coming down here.

39:10.834 --> 39:12.910
It's gonna be a while.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.643
<i>It's probably the best news
we could possibly get.</i>

39:14.667 --> 39:17.100
<i>This is the catalyst</i>
<i>for the beginning</i>
<i>of our season.</i>

39:18.467 --> 39:21.242
But now that it's broken,
we don't have any time
to mess.

39:21.266 --> 39:25.200
So at this point,
it's all hands on deck,
ready to roll.

39:25.266 --> 39:26.400
<i>It's go time.</i>

39:45.667 --> 39:47.443
We have a lot of ground
to get through,

39:47.467 --> 39:48.943
a lot of rocks we have to wash.

39:48.967 --> 39:51.166
And right now, we have
no wash plant running.

It's like Niagara Falls
just burst into the cut.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.200
Come here right now.

40:37.266 --> 40:39.443
[bleep].
Okay, I'm on my way.

40:39.467 --> 40:41.976
[Paul] <i>Snowmelt</i>
<i>is filling the ditch</i>

40:42.000 --> 40:44.242
<i>and threatening

40:44.266 --> 40:49.076
<i>If it does, Acres of gold rich
ground could be underwater,</i>

40:49.100 --> 40:50.967
<i>delaying mining for weeks.</i>

40:54.367 --> 40:56.343
[Tyson] We have practically
Niagara Falls.

40:56.367 --> 40:58.810
And this is because
of a record snowfall year,

40:58.834 --> 41:00.343
and it's starting to warm up.

41:00.367 --> 41:02.000
So we have to deal
with this now.

41:04.567 --> 41:07.343
The only thing I can think of
is we have a six-inch pump,

41:07.367 --> 41:08.767
so I'm going to radio Alec.

41:12.767 --> 41:14.867

41:21.266 --> 41:28.242
Tyson and mechanic Alec Kelly
work fast to fire it up before
the melt floods the cut.

41:28.266 --> 41:31.343
You'd say closer
to the river's more thawed
than further away?

41:31.367 --> 41:32.367
- Looks like it.
- Yeah.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.934
- All clear?
- Oh, yeah.

41:41.467 --> 41:42.600
Come on, baby.

41:51.867 --> 41:53.100
Oh, yeah!

41:54.867 --> 41:57.109
Oh, my [bleep].

41:57.133 --> 41:59.343
You said you had faith in it.

41:59.367 --> 42:02.007
It's gonna wash away
the berms and the pump's
gonna be in the drain.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.367
[bleep].

42:15.100 --> 42:18.142
We could move your truck
and get the whole thing

42:18.166 --> 42:20.643
and get that staged up at least.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.543
If we hook up to the teeth
on the front...

42:23.567 --> 42:24.767
- Yeah.
- Real tight.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.300
You can kind of like
roll the bucket

42:26.367 --> 42:28.710
and it'll pull the pipe
straight with it.

42:28.734 --> 42:31.300
Oh, yeah. I just really
don't want to break that pipe.

42:42.834 --> 42:44.943
Come down a little bit.

42:44.967 --> 42:47.142

on different angles,

43:03.834 --> 43:07.443

little impurities
can cause it to leak.

44:57.266 --> 44:59.076
Oh, I love these mud puddles.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.867
[Paul] <i>...Fred Lewis</i>
<i>is on a mission.</i>

45:01.934 --> 45:04.334
<i>Now the river has broken,</i>
<i>he's called in mechanic,</i>
<i>JB Mayer...</i>

45:07.667 --> 45:09.867
Holy [bleep]!

45:09.934 --> 45:11.576
[laughs]

45:11.600 --> 45:14.367
[Paul] <i>...to investigate</i>
<i>a vital piece of equipment</i>
<i>for the season.</i>

45:17.166 --> 45:18.743
[Fred] I have a couple
of leads on a dozer.

45:18.767 --> 45:19.943
[JB Mayer] Oh, really?

45:19.967 --> 45:22.076
This dozer is probably
the most important thing

45:22.100 --> 45:23.667
we could acquire right now.

45:23.734 --> 45:25.976
That is the biggest missing part

45:26.000 --> 45:28.343
to our, to our season this year.

45:28.367 --> 45:32.000
If we can't get a dozer,
obviously we're not mining
gold this year.

45:32.834 --> 45:37.009
[Paul] <i>They're heading</i>
<i>to Duncan Creek to meet</i>
<i>with mine owner Troy Taylor,</i>

45:37.033 --> 45:38.734
<i>who's got a dozer for sale.</i>

45:40.033 --> 45:42.843
- He is Rick Ness's
claim owner.
- Oh, okay.

45:42.867 --> 45:45.100
So he's got experience
in gold mining quite a bit.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.343
I would think, you know,
if he sold us some junk

45:48.367 --> 45:50.543
and... and then, you know,
we get it up there

45:50.567 --> 45:52.667
and, you know,
it breaks down and it's...

45:52.734 --> 45:53.810
- We know where he lives.
- Yeah.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.133
- Yeah, I mean...
- [Fred laughs]

46:07.066 --> 46:08.200
You see this thing?

46:09.300 --> 46:11.543
- How's it going?
- Good. How are you?

46:11.567 --> 46:12.976
- Nice to meet you.
- You found me.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.910
Yeah.

46:14.934 --> 46:16.567
Holy cow!
This thing's big.

46:19.266 --> 46:24.976
[Paul] <i>The Komatsu D355</i>
<i>weighs 53 tons.</i>

46:25.000 --> 46:26.142
[Troy] It's a beast.

46:26.166 --> 46:28.810
It's done a lot of work for us
over the years.

46:28.834 --> 46:32.074
[Paul] <i>The 14-foot blade</i>
<i>is capable of shifting almost</i>
<i>30 tons of dirt in one push.</i>

46:35.967 --> 46:39.042
[Troy] At 410 horsepower,
I think that's what
it's rated at.

46:39.066 --> 46:40.142
[Fred] That's like a D9...

46:40.166 --> 46:43.142
[Troy] Yeah, that's right.
Something like that.

46:43.166 --> 46:44.600
[Fred] What year
did you say it was?

46:44.667 --> 46:46.133
[Troy] 1984.

46:48.467 --> 46:49.910
It's got a leak
in the final drive,

46:49.934 --> 46:52.443
so I can show you that
and how to deal with that.

46:52.467 --> 46:56.109
Well, we want to... can we
get, can we hear a starting up
and hear it roar?

46:56.133 --> 46:57.533
[Troy] Sure.
Are you ready for that?

47:00.266 --> 47:01.843
[Fred] Oh, wow.

47:01.867 --> 47:02.867
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

47:05.867 --> 47:08.042
Okay. Here we go.

47:08.066 --> 47:09.567
[engine choking]

47:16.266 --> 47:17.343
Uh-oh.

47:17.367 --> 47:18.934
Sounds like the battery
is a bit weak.

47:20.266 --> 47:21.667
Yeah.

47:23.667 --> 47:25.166
It's not a good start, eh?

47:28.266 --> 47:30.266
I've got some jumper cables
in my truck.

47:36.467 --> 47:37.734
That's good.

47:39.066 --> 47:40.600
Don't wanna
blow anything up here.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.500
Okay. You're ready?

47:49.667 --> 47:52.367
[engine starting]

47:55.834 --> 47:57.443
Come on, baby.

47:57.467 --> 48:00.142
Come on. Come on.

48:00.166 --> 48:01.710
- [Fred] Come on, baby.
- [Troy] Come on.

48:01.734 --> 48:02.734
[Fred] Woo-hoo-hoo!

48:04.166 --> 48:06.400
- [Troy] It's alive.
- It's alive.

48:08.166 --> 48:09.600
She's purring like a kitten now.

48:09.667 --> 48:11.100
This is what we wanted to hear.

48:16.667 --> 48:18.100
Yeah.

48:20.133 --> 48:22.400
Keep your hand
on the ledge and...

48:27.667 --> 48:29.066
You know, that thing's so tall.

48:30.767 --> 48:33.127
I mean, that's a massive
amount of snow and dirt
right there.

48:35.066 --> 48:37.543
[Paul]
<i>JB has 20 years' experience</i>

48:37.567 --> 48:39.867
<i>working on heavy equipment
in the Army.</i>

48:41.600 --> 48:42.867
So I looked over here,

48:42.934 --> 48:45.543
I don't see anything
new coming out hydraulic wise.

48:45.567 --> 48:47.743
Everything looks good and solid.

48:47.767 --> 48:51.242
I did see on this side
there's one roller that
is, kind of, wobbling.

48:51.266 --> 48:52.710
[Fred] Okay.

48:52.734 --> 48:54.643
[JB Mayer] But you see
that one's smaller,
and there's a gap there.

48:54.667 --> 48:56.600
[Fred] Is it missing a seal
or something?

48:56.667 --> 48:58.242
[Jab Mayer] No, it's just
starting to go out.

48:58.266 --> 48:59.643
The rollers, the rollers go out.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.142
[Fred] It's a big fix
or is it an easy fix?

49:01.166 --> 49:02.166
No, easy fix.

49:02.867 --> 49:04.667
- Man, I don't know.
- What are your thoughts?

49:06.166 --> 49:09.242
This is, you know, to me,
this is a big deal
for our season.

49:09.266 --> 49:11.600
I think we need to seal it.
I think we need to say yes.

49:14.500 --> 49:17.142
All right. So I guess
the only other thing
we have to ask is price.

49:17.166 --> 49:19.343
What do you...
What are you thinking?

49:19.367 --> 49:25.743
What we think it's worth
is 45,000, and so, um...

49:25.767 --> 49:27.943
Okay. You mind if JB and I go
and have a little talk?

49:27.967 --> 49:29.142
- [Troy] Sure.
- Just talk it over?

49:29.166 --> 49:30.910
-Yeah.
-[Fred] Okay, cool.
We'll be back in a minute.

49:30.934 --> 49:32.042
- [JB Mayer] Cool.
- All right.

49:32.066 --> 49:33.409
What are you thinking?

49:33.433 --> 49:35.810
Man, I tell you, I think
you're getting a deal
of a lifetime.

49:35.834 --> 49:36.867
I do, too.

49:36.934 --> 49:38.910
Um, I hate to... I hate
to nickel and dime,

49:38.934 --> 49:41.867
but if we could get
that down to 40,

49:41.934 --> 49:45.343
it opens up extra money
for us and... and it would pay
for the shipping.

49:45.367 --> 49:46.643
You're the budget guy.

49:46.667 --> 49:48.543
So, I mean, you know
what I mean,
but I'm just telling you,

49:48.567 --> 49:51.009
from my opinion, I think
it's worth, you know,

49:51.033 --> 49:53.033
you know, every penny of it,
you know?

49:55.767 --> 49:57.142
So what do you think?

49:57.166 --> 49:58.743
- We definitely want it.
- Yeah.

49:58.767 --> 50:00.142
Um, I want to ask one question.

50:00.166 --> 50:01.400
I don't want to offend you.

50:01.467 --> 50:03.307
Um, with our budget
being super tight
right now,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.543
is there any chance
you could go down to 40?

50:06.567 --> 50:08.300
Uh... Well.

50:09.567 --> 50:10.843
How about this,
before you answer?

50:10.867 --> 50:12.242
Because I can tell you
don't like it.

50:12.266 --> 50:15.076
What if I offer you
1% of gold bonus

50:15.100 --> 50:16.643
at the end of our season
from what we pull?

50:16.667 --> 50:18.142
Hmm.

50:18.166 --> 50:19.710
[Fred] Because that would save
our budget now

50:19.734 --> 50:23.076
and at the end of the season,
we'll give you that plus some.

50:23.100 --> 50:24.910
Yeah. Okay.

50:24.934 --> 50:29.834
If I take 40
and 1% gold bonus, yeah?

50:34.467 --> 50:36.976
Yeah. I think we could do
something like that,
it sounds good.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.843
- Yeah.
- Awesome. Let's do it.

50:38.867 --> 50:41.009
And our target right now
is 500 ounces,

50:41.033 --> 50:44.042
so it should be enough to more
than cover that five grand

50:44.066 --> 50:45.600
and it really helps us out
in a bind.

50:45.667 --> 50:46.810
So I really appreciate it.

50:46.834 --> 50:48.443
We got a dozer.

50:48.467 --> 50:50.109
It's awesome, man.
I'm super happy with it.

50:50.133 --> 50:51.443
- Ah! You have no idea.
- [Troy] Yeah.

50:51.467 --> 50:53.242
[Fred] All right. Well,
we'll get out of your hair.

50:53.266 --> 50:55.343
-All right. Yeah.
-I'm super excited.
Thank you so much.

50:55.367 --> 50:56.810
- All right, Troy.
- [indistinct chatter]

50:56.834 --> 50:58.000
- Thanks.
- Take care.

51:08.367 --> 51:11.042
We want to get this
cut down and done

51:11.066 --> 51:12.500
well within the next week.

51:12.567 --> 51:16.300
All this stuff is nice to work
right now that's frozen,

51:16.367 --> 51:17.667
but the moment
it starts to thaw,

51:17.734 --> 51:21.066
it makes it a lot harder
and more expensive to work it.

51:23.300 --> 51:26.242
[Paul] <i>The Beets family</i>
<i>led by son Mike,</i>

Okay. Let's have a look-see.

53:57.667 --> 53:58.667
That's not good.

54:00.266 --> 54:03.000
Looks like a hose busted.

which we don't have in stock.

54:16.567 --> 54:19.242
So, uh, truck's down for a bit.

54:19.266 --> 54:20.543
How long you figure?

54:20.567 --> 54:22.807
With the way shipping
has been, probably
a couple of days.

54:24.367 --> 54:25.443
[bleep]! That's no good.

54:25.467 --> 54:27.009
I need as many trucks
as possible right now.

54:27.033 --> 54:29.400
You're going to call Tony
to figure out a plan?

54:29.467 --> 54:31.343
No.

54:31.367 --> 54:33.127
There's a lot of trucks
at the Indian, right?

54:33.266 --> 54:34.543
I believe so.

54:34.567 --> 54:36.743
Only take me a day
to slip into the Indian

54:36.767 --> 54:38.042
and go grab the truck,

54:38.066 --> 54:40.142
so I'll go line that up

54:40.166 --> 54:42.300
and you make sure stuff
don't break around here.

54:42.367 --> 54:43.643

55:47.233 --> 55:49.443
- Yeah, it's been
a couple of seasons.
- It's been a while, eh?

55:49.467 --> 55:51.109
- Yeah.
- How are things going,
anyways?

55:51.133 --> 55:52.333
Going great with me.

55:52.367 --> 55:54.343
It'd be nicer if I knew more
of what was going on myself.

55:54.367 --> 55:55.409
Yeah, I know.

55:55.433 --> 55:57.142
Yeah, because I've just
been up here in the dark

a little bit
for the last week,
ten days or something.

56:00.567 --> 56:03.000
We're going to liquidate
some stuff here and, you know,

56:03.133 --> 56:05.166
and thin the herd out, I guess,

56:05.233 --> 56:08.109
and hopefully, hopefully,
we'll be back out soon, right?

56:08.133 --> 56:11.066
But as of, as of us mining
this season, I have no idea.

56:13.033 --> 56:14.343

at least a couple of weeks
behind by now.

Yeah.

and you think,
like, what happened?

really good.

- Wow!

[Rick] Doesn't that look cool,
though? Look at that.

56:30.033 --> 56:31.242
That represents victory
right there.

56:31.266 --> 56:33.066
- [Nathan] Yeah.
- I don't know how to top it.

56:33.367 --> 56:35.543
I mean, I will.
I'll top it next year.

56:35.567 --> 56:37.867
I haven't been able to talk
to Rick much.

56:37.934 --> 56:39.743
To be honest with you,
I have no idea
what's going on.

56:39.767 --> 56:41.076
Um...

56:41.100 --> 56:42.600
Well, I hope
everything's all right.

56:42.667 --> 56:44.667
- Like...
- Yeah.

56:44.734 --> 56:50.743
All we can do is tighten up
some stuff around the yard
here and hope and pray

56:50.767 --> 56:52.667
that we... we're out here
mining soon, right?

57:08.100 --> 57:10.400
[Mike] Now we're here.

57:10.467 --> 57:12.343
We'll go see about
getting that rock truck
out of the line.

57:12.367 --> 57:13.810
Okay.

57:13.834 --> 57:16.543
[Paul] <i>Mike Beets</i>
<i>is on the hunt</i>
<i>for a working rock truck</i>

57:16.567 --> 57:19.333
<i>at the family's shuttered
Indian River camp.</i>

57:21.000 --> 57:22.867
And here's the rock truck
we came here to get.

57:24.033 --> 57:27.643
[Paul] <i>With three rock trucks</i>
<i>down at Paradise Hill,</i>

57:27.667 --> 57:31.109
<i>Mike's hoping this one
will keep things moving.</i>

57:31.133 --> 57:33.042
[Mike] We don't want to slow
down the production there

57:33.066 --> 57:34.166
even in the slightest.

57:34.233 --> 57:36.543
So we're over here
grabbing a rock truck,

57:36.567 --> 57:39.166
even though it's costing me
and Ruby not being there.

57:39.233 --> 57:41.343
The hell!

57:41.367 --> 57:43.443
[Ruby] All the fluids are good
and still in place.

57:43.467 --> 57:44.667
So hopefully she starts.

57:44.734 --> 57:46.667
Otherwise, it's a complete
waste of the day.

57:50.066 --> 57:51.166
[engine chokes]

57:51.233 --> 57:52.567
Oh, come on.

57:54.567 --> 57:56.100
Oh, are you [bleep] kidding?

57:57.467 --> 57:58.843
Come on, baby.
One more time.

57:58.867 --> 58:00.100
Start out for me.

58:01.667 --> 58:02.667
Yeah. There we go.

58:05.133 --> 58:07.667
[Paul] <i>To speed up</i>
<i>the stripping</i>
<i>at Paradise Hill,</i>

58:07.734 --> 58:10.333
<i>Mike grabs a spare D6 dozer.</i>

58:12.567 --> 58:14.943
[Mike] It's taking us
a bit longer than I thought.

58:14.967 --> 58:16.867
We've already been out
and about to do this

58:16.934 --> 58:19.076
about for four and a half hours.

58:19.100 --> 58:21.543
That's a lot of time
[bleep] go wrong.

58:21.567 --> 58:23.976
Three to four minutes is all
it takes to [bleep] go to hell

58:24.000 --> 58:25.333
when you're running trucks.

58:26.767 --> 58:28.343
Ruby, you're in the rock truck.

58:28.367 --> 58:29.767
Evan will act as a pilot car.

58:29.834 --> 58:31.810
I'm going to [bleep] off
ahead of you guys.

58:31.834 --> 58:33.594
Let's get going
while we can still get going.

58:39.500 --> 58:43.867
[Paul] <i>Mike now faces</i>
<i>a 40-mile drive back</i>
<i>to Paradise Hill.</i>

58:43.934 --> 58:47.109
<i>To avoid the road bends
on the highways,</i>

58:47.133 --> 58:49.309
<i>Mike's taking local roads.</i>

58:49.333 --> 58:52.934
<i>It's an icy, mud slicked route
back to the hill.</i>

58:54.166 --> 58:56.600
Lost all my momentum
on the [bleep].

58:56.667 --> 58:59.767
Bob's old road is garbage.

59:04.100 --> 59:05.467
Look at this.

59:11.367 --> 59:13.443
[bleep]

59:13.467 --> 59:15.710
It's [bleep] road's way
too [bleep] greasy.

59:15.734 --> 59:18.600
I'm not going to be able
to get up at this rate.

59:18.667 --> 59:21.867
[Paul] <i>Up ahead,</i>
<i>the steepest part</i>
<i>of the road...</i>

59:23.467 --> 59:26.567
<i>a hill on a 25 degree incline.</i>

59:30.500 --> 59:32.740
[Mike] It's a dangerous game
trying to drive up that hill

59:33.100 --> 59:34.266
when it's this muddy.

59:40.100 --> 59:42.000
[Ruby speaking]

59:45.767 --> 59:47.343
Oh, I mean...
I don't know about you,

59:47.367 --> 59:49.343
but I've been slipping
and sliding across [bleep]

59:49.367 --> 59:50.976
everywhere I've been going,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.109
and I'm most definitely
not going to make that hill.

59:53.133 --> 59:56.042
Oh, okay.
Do we have a game plan?

59:56.066 --> 59:59.066
[Mike] I don't know.
I'll have a chat with my dad.

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:02.733
Tony Beets, do you copy,
Tony Beets?

1:00:04.166 --> 1:00:07.543
We came out at the Indian
to replace the rock truck
that was down,

1:00:07.567 --> 1:00:10.042
but the road is so [bleep]
greasy right now,

1:00:10.066 --> 1:00:11.946
I'm pretty sure I ain't going
to make that hill.

1:00:12.767 --> 1:00:14.976
[Tony speaking on radio]

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:16.367
[Mike] Okay. I'll be waiting.

1:00:20.266 --> 1:00:22.867
[Tony speaking]

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.943
We're hoping to make this quick

1:00:47.967 --> 1:00:50.910
and get that rock truck back
so we can get it to work.

1:00:50.934 --> 1:00:52.710
But as is, I think it's going
to be pretty late

1:00:52.734 --> 1:00:55.033
before the rock trucks
makes it back to camp.

1:01:03.066 --> 1:01:04.233
[Tony speaking]

1:01:13.734 --> 1:01:14.910
Okay.

1:01:14.934 --> 1:01:16.343
[Paul] <i>Tony's plan.</i>

1:01:37.066 --> 1:01:38.667
[Tony speaking]

1:01:38.734 --> 1:01:40.214
- [Mike] Yeah, yeah.
- [Tony speaking]

1:01:43.467 --> 1:01:44.567

<i>With dad's help,
Mike's back on track.</i>

1:03:40.467 --> 1:03:42.400
[Mike] So, I better hurry
to get this dozer

1:03:42.467 --> 1:03:46.009
and that rock truck back
to the Hill so I can
get them working.

1:03:46.033 --> 1:03:48.166
It won't be long
till we start hauling pay.

1:04:05.266 --> 1:04:07.767
- Hey there, youngster.
- What's happenin'?

1:04:07.834 --> 1:04:11.076
[Paul] <i>With more ground</i>
<i>to mine than ever before...</i>

1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:12.776
- [Parker] Good to be seen.
- How you doing?

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:17.643
[Paul] <i>...and plans to open up</i>
<i>even more in Alaska</i>
<i>later in the year,</i>

1:04:17.667 --> 1:04:22.042
<i>Parker calls a council of war

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:24.506
<i>foreman Mitch Blaschke</i>
<i>and gold recovery expert,</i>
<i>Chris Doumitt.</i>

1:04:27.467 --> 1:04:28.543
It's good and bad.

1:04:28.567 --> 1:04:33.266
It's good because
we have lots of ground.

1:04:33.333 --> 1:04:36.209
It's bad because
we will have an additional,

1:04:36.233 --> 1:04:39.000
whatever, two million square
feet to mine for Tony.

1:04:40.033 --> 1:04:41.643
[Mitch] That's a lot
of sluicing on its own,

1:04:41.667 --> 1:04:43.343
let alone anything else.

1:04:43.367 --> 1:04:45.343
[Parker] Yeah.

1:04:45.367 --> 1:04:47.867
There's a lot there.
There's... there's a lot
to do.

1:04:47.934 --> 1:04:50.242
I wouldn't be suggesting it
if I didn't think
we could get it done.

1:04:50.266 --> 1:04:52.042
So our leases will have
a pretty busy season.

1:04:52.066 --> 1:04:54.000
A lot of landlords
to keep happy.

1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:56.500
[Chris] Yeah. Not a lot of us.

1:04:56.567 --> 1:04:57.910
It sounds like too much stress.

1:04:57.934 --> 1:04:59.242
I quit.

1:04:59.266 --> 1:05:01.266
We know what the [bleep]
we're doing, don't we?

1:05:10.767 --> 1:05:13.767
So here we are,
in the first cut
of the season.

1:05:15.567 --> 1:05:17.767
[Paul] <i>Despite</i>
<i>the team's reservations,</i>

1:05:17.834 --> 1:05:20.309
<i>Tyson has sprinted
out of the blocks.</i>

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:22.643
<i>He's protected the cut
from flooding</i>

1:05:22.667 --> 1:05:24.000
<i>and is ready to run paydirt.</i>

1:05:31.367 --> 1:05:33.976
Hey, tater tot,
that's the first load of pay
going to Big Red,

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.109
so we got a lot of rock
to wash this year

1:05:37.133 --> 1:05:38.166
<i>and a lot of mud to move.</i>

1:05:38.233 --> 1:05:39.843
So let's make her count.

1:05:39.867 --> 1:05:42.409
Woo-hoo! Let madness begin.

1:05:42.433 --> 1:05:45.467
[Paul] <i>Now it's on Mitch</i>
<i>to get the plant fired up.</i>

1:05:46.467 --> 1:05:48.343
It's going to be
a crazy challenge to try

1:05:48.367 --> 1:05:50.033
and get through
all this dirt this year.

1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:54.000
And the only way we're going
to get it is if we do it right

1:05:54.233 --> 1:05:55.643
and even doing everything right,

1:05:55.667 --> 1:05:57.643
I still don't know
if we're going
to get through it all.

1:05:57.667 --> 1:06:00.600
There's going to be so much
pressure on sluicing,

1:06:00.667 --> 1:06:04.443
which means that these wash
plants have to run flawless.

1:06:04.467 --> 1:06:08.142
[Paul] <i>It's the earliest</i>
<i>Parker's ever tried to sluice.</i>

1:06:08.166 --> 1:06:12.042
<i>Wash plant, Big Red, has been
lying in the cut all winter</i>

1:06:12.066 --> 1:06:13.843
<i>with record snow</i>

1:06:13.867 --> 1:06:18.500
<i>and temperatures dropping
below minus 50 degrees.</i>

1:06:18.567 --> 1:06:19.843
[Parker] You about
ready to fire up?

1:06:19.867 --> 1:06:21.810
[Mitch] Yeah. Just got
to throw some water at it,

1:06:21.834 --> 1:06:23.543
- hopefully, all that works.
- All right.

1:06:23.567 --> 1:06:25.247
And then see if she remembers
how to shake.

1:06:32.934 --> 1:06:35.166
[Parker] Ready. Give it.

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:38.076
[engine starting]

1:06:38.100 --> 1:06:40.910
Come on. Wake up. Wake up.

1:06:40.934 --> 1:06:42.767
Come on.

1:06:42.834 --> 1:06:45.543
It's been a long winter.
It might take it a minute.

1:06:45.567 --> 1:06:47.867
[engine starts]

1:06:52.734 --> 1:06:53.834
Oh, yeah.

1:07:00.066 --> 1:07:01.976
All right, now we've got
our water pump fired up.

1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.409
We're just going to let it
warm up here,

1:07:03.433 --> 1:07:05.233
but it's sending water
up the Big Red.

1:07:07.133 --> 1:07:08.600
[Paul] <i>Wash plant, Big Red,</i>

<i>using only gravity and water.</i>

1:07:14.667 --> 1:07:16.843
<i>Pay dirt is loaded

1:07:16.867 --> 1:07:21.109
<i>and blasted</i>
<i>with 90,000 gallons of water</i>

1:07:21.133 --> 1:07:23.367
<i>washing out the dirt and rocks</i>

1:07:23.433 --> 1:07:25.313
<i>while the heavier gold
settles into the sluices.</i>

1:07:38.166 --> 1:07:40.743
Well, we'll start the shaker,
fire up the feed bin.

1:07:40.767 --> 1:07:43.076
As long as all that's working
and happy,

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:46.667
we can start putting this dirt
in there and start
turning it into gold.

1:07:46.734 --> 1:07:48.500
You ready?

1:07:48.567 --> 1:07:49.834
Here we go.

1:07:51.767 --> 1:07:53.166
Come on, baby.

1:07:56.567 --> 1:07:59.867
[Paul] <i>For Parker, to hit</i>
<i>his target on the airstrip,</i>

1:07:59.934 --> 1:08:04.567
<i>Big Red will need to sluice</i>
<i>24X7 for its longest</i>
<i>season ever.</i>

1:08:07.667 --> 1:08:09.867
You know, for this wash plant
to sit up here

1:08:09.934 --> 1:08:11.943
through a Yukon winter,

1:08:11.967 --> 1:08:15.209
got it fired right back up
here and we're back
to washing rocks.

1:08:15.233 --> 1:08:17.209
If you look around here,

1:08:17.233 --> 1:08:20.867
you know, we're the only ones,
as far as I can see, doing it.

1:08:20.934 --> 1:08:23.309
So that just tells you
we're off to an early start

1:08:23.333 --> 1:08:25.893

any money up here,

1:08:32.667 --> 1:08:34.242

1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:21.910
[Mike] Oh, that's good.
Took us long enough.

1:10:21.934 --> 1:10:23.867
[Ruby] No kidding.

1:10:23.934 --> 1:10:25.343
[Mike] That's definitely
pay right there.

1:10:25.367 --> 1:10:27.910
- You can see it all over.
- [Ruby] That yellowy stuff.

1:10:27.934 --> 1:10:29.166
Yeah, that's good stuff.

1:10:30.233 --> 1:10:32.109
It has that nice sound
when we drop it, too.

1:10:32.133 --> 1:10:34.209
Click, click, click, click of
the rocks. I love that sound.

1:10:34.233 --> 1:10:35.543
[Ruby] Yep. Perfect.

1:10:35.567 --> 1:10:37.643
[Mike] Which means,
we can start sluicing soon

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:40.500

to work from.

[Fred] Buzz is a loyal friend,

about mining.

1:14:15.333 --> 1:14:17.767
Without buzz,
we're dead in the water.

1:14:19.133 --> 1:14:20.867
Hey, we're pumped.
We're ready to go.

1:14:20.934 --> 1:14:22.133
All right, let's do it.

1:14:23.867 --> 1:14:25.810
I feel kind of jittery,
kind of excited.

1:14:25.834 --> 1:14:27.009
I'm ready to get this moving.

1:14:27.033 --> 1:14:29.042
You know, once we cross
that river,

1:14:29.066 --> 1:14:30.706

when our season begins.

[Fred] <i>I came out here, kind of,</i>

<i>thinking that

1:15:23.734 --> 1:15:25.133
<i>but it's definitely
winter up here.</i>

1:15:27.467 --> 1:15:30.000
Oh, man.

1:15:30.033 --> 1:15:33.367
I just look back
at one of these side roads

1:15:33.433 --> 1:15:35.242
off of the main road here,

1:15:35.266 --> 1:15:40.166
and I think we're going
to be snowed out.

1:15:47.166 --> 1:15:48.433
[Fred] Oh, boy.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.667
Look at all the snow.

1:15:57.266 --> 1:15:58.367
Hey.

1:16:01.767 --> 1:16:04.343
This snow here
is three to four feet deep.

1:16:04.367 --> 1:16:08.543
Yeah, we're going to have
to do quite a bit
of snow removal.

1:16:08.567 --> 1:16:12.634
[Paul] <i>The road</i>
<i>to Fred's claim is buried</i>
<i>under thick snow and ice...</i>

1:16:14.667 --> 1:16:18.042
<i>and with Fred's new dozer

1:16:18.066 --> 1:16:21.667
<i>all they have to clear it
is Buzz's little dozer.</i>

1:16:42.233 --> 1:16:43.910
[Fred] <i>Right now,</i>
<i>we're kind of</i>
<i>in a time crunch.</i>

1:16:43.934 --> 1:16:46.042
I have my fuel guy come
up here to deliver fuel,

1:16:46.066 --> 1:16:48.643
but he beat us up here
and right now
he's been waiting

1:16:48.667 --> 1:16:51.166
for probably several hours
on us to get out here.

1:16:51.233 --> 1:16:53.567
<i>So we really got to freaking
move right now.</i>

1:16:56.533 --> 1:16:59.767
[Paul] <i>Fred's ordered half</i>
<i>a season's worth of fuel.</i>

1:16:59.834 --> 1:17:01.874
<i>If the dozer can't open
the road for the fuel truck,</i>

1:17:03.066 --> 1:17:07.667
<i>it will have to leave</i>
<i>and Fred will suffer</i>
<i>yet another setback.</i>

1:17:10.367 --> 1:17:12.343
Hopefully, that fuel truck
is not going to leave.

1:17:12.367 --> 1:17:14.100
So that's my biggest concern
right now.

1:17:25.867 --> 1:17:27.710
<i>Bringing that little dozer
out here was a gamble.</i>

1:17:27.734 --> 1:17:29.810
<i>I honestly didn't know</i>
<i>what it was going</i>
<i>to be able to do.</i>

1:17:29.834 --> 1:17:31.234
I hadn't anticipated
this much snow.

1:17:31.867 --> 1:17:33.409
So have we not gambled
with that,

1:17:33.433 --> 1:17:35.309
we'd be up [bleep] creek
right now.

1:17:35.333 --> 1:17:37.433

He's ready to go.
He doesn't have any more time.

1:17:51.133 --> 1:17:53.933
So we're just going to have
to get [bleep] moving
to get out of his way.

1:17:59.533 --> 1:18:00.533
Ooh.

1:18:01.133 --> 1:18:02.634
Oh, boy.

1:18:11.667 --> 1:18:13.810

<i>So I think my truck</i>
<i>is good to go.</i>

1:18:13.834 --> 1:18:16.595
<i>I'm going to hop in</i>
<i>and I'm going to go for it.</i>
<i>We got to get up there.</i>

1:18:26.166 --> 1:18:28.943
- [bleep] yeah, dude.
- [bleep] yeah.

1:18:28.967 --> 1:18:31.076
Without the little dozer,
we couldn't have did it, man.

1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:32.867
She's a beast, that little guy.

1:18:32.934 --> 1:18:35.409

[Fred] <i>I know the gold's there,</i>

<i>out of the ground</i>
<i>and on the scales.</i>

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:49.440
<i>Let's go down there
and check it out.</i>

1:18:51.567 --> 1:18:53.567
What the [bleep] is that?

1:18:56.667 --> 1:18:57.810
Holy crap!

1:18:57.834 --> 1:18:59.309
[JB Mayer] I thought
we were mining a creek.

1:18:59.333 --> 1:19:00.333
[Fred] Wow!

1:19:00.734 --> 1:19:02.567
That's... Oh, my [bleep].

1:19:02.634 --> 1:19:04.042
Wow!

1:19:04.066 --> 1:19:06.867
Our entire claim is under ice.

1:19:09.433 --> 1:19:11.834
That's a glacier, right there.

1:19:16.867 --> 1:19:20.567
[Paul] <i>Last year, Fred mined</i>
<i>the banks of California Creek.</i>

1:19:22.567 --> 1:19:28.443
<i>Now the gold-rich pay dirt</i>
<i>is buried under</i>
<i>a sheet of ice.</i>

1:19:28.467 --> 1:19:29.834

What the hell are we going
to do, man?

1:19:32.934 --> 1:19:35.242
So this is where we separate
the men from the boys.

1:19:35.266 --> 1:19:37.810
Right now, I feel like
a little boy and we need
to think really hard

1:19:37.834 --> 1:19:39.743
about how we're going
to tackle this
before we tackle it

1:19:39.767 --> 1:19:41.042
because someone could die
in this...

1:19:41.066 --> 1:19:42.433

1:20:57.634 --> 1:20:58.843
We have been just stripping

1:20:58.867 --> 1:21:02.009
and, like, between
the stripping and the wages,

1:21:02.033 --> 1:21:03.867

<i>earlier than expected,</i>

But it's good for you that
you delegated to them though,

- It takes everybody, man.

1:23:58.867 --> 1:24:00.309
It's your machine.

1:24:00.333 --> 1:24:02.443
[Paul] <i>After running</i>
<i>for four days,</i>

1:24:02.467 --> 1:24:07.667
<i>the team is eager to see</i>
<i>how the new Tony Beets'</i>
<i>claim pays out.</i>

1:24:07.734 --> 1:24:08.743
[Chris] All right.

1:24:08.767 --> 1:24:14.509
20, 40, 60, 70.

1:24:14.533 --> 1:24:16.042
Come on, keep going. 80.

1:24:16.066 --> 1:24:17.209
We're going to break a 100?
Huh?

1:24:17.233 --> 1:24:18.567
[Mitch] We're going.
We're going.

1:24:18.634 --> 1:24:19.634
110.120.

1:24:22.667 --> 1:24:25.509
137.8.

1:24:25.533 --> 1:24:29.367
[Paul] <i>Worth over $240,000.</i>

1:24:29.433 --> 1:24:32.109
- [Chris] Not bad
for a first run.
- [Mitch] Yeah.

1:24:32.133 --> 1:24:34.109
And you got to think about
how early it is

1:24:34.133 --> 1:24:35.343
and it was thawed.

1:24:35.367 --> 1:24:37.767
So all I can say is
"Thanks, Tony."

1:24:37.834 --> 1:24:39.309
[Chris] Thanks, Tony. Yeah.

1:24:39.333 --> 1:24:41.142
[Mitch] It should be
a busy place down
here this year

1:24:41.166 --> 1:24:42.610
- if we get through
all that ground.
- Yeah.

1:24:42.634 --> 1:24:45.042
Especially, once you get
Slucifer going,

1:24:45.066 --> 1:24:46.643
this place gets hopping.

1:24:46.667 --> 1:24:47.867
[Mitch] Keep up the good work.

1:24:47.934 --> 1:24:49.174
[Parker] Thanks, guys.
Thanks...

1:24:49.367 --> 1:24:52.166
Thanks for coming back
this year, too.

1:24:52.233 --> 1:24:53.266
Chris.

1:24:54.767 --> 1:24:56.509
I heard my vo...
I heard my name.

1:24:56.533 --> 1:24:58.066
Yes, Lord.

1:24:59.266 --> 1:25:01.667
[Parker] Thanks... Thanks
for coming back this year.

1:25:01.734 --> 1:25:03.209
Oh, well, thanks for the invite.

1:25:03.233 --> 1:25:05.710
- It's good to have
the gang back together.
- It is.

1:25:05.734 --> 1:25:07.910
Things seem solid
and equipment's running good

1:25:07.934 --> 1:25:11.667
and we've got gold
on the scale and yeah...

1:25:11.734 --> 1:25:12.767
[Mitch] Knock on wood.

1:25:13.834 --> 1:25:15.567
It's all downhill
from here, right?

1:25:15.634 --> 1:25:16.843
[laughter]

1:25:16.867 --> 1:25:19.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:25:19.233 --> 1:25:20.443
I'm out. Excuse.

1:25:20.467 --> 1:25:22.242
- Cool.
- Okay.

1:25:22.266 --> 1:25:24.710
[Parker] We definitely
have a lot to do this year.

1:25:24.734 --> 1:25:26.100
The plate's overflowing.

1:25:27.767 --> 1:25:29.233
But...

1:25:30.567 --> 1:25:33.667
this is a good start
if we're going to try
to get it all done, but...

1:25:35.967 --> 1:25:39.166
my dad would not be impressed
if I were saying things
like this.

1:25:39.233 --> 1:25:41.367
He'll... "You got
to be optimistic
and, you know,

1:25:41.433 --> 1:25:42.567
get after it," but...

1:25:46.567 --> 1:25:48.000
We'll see.

1:26:01.867 --> 1:26:04.467
Rick's a pretty,
pretty closed off guy,

1:26:04.533 --> 1:26:07.610
but it just seems like lately
he's been a little bit
more closed off.

1:26:07.634 --> 1:26:10.543
Last year, Rick did over
2,000 ounces

1:26:10.567 --> 1:26:12.076
and the fact
that he's not up there,

1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:14.076
they're just chomping
at the bit to try and do

1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:17.743
even more this season
is a real head-scratcher
for me.

1:26:17.767 --> 1:26:20.367
I was actually going
back up for a stretch
and give him a hand and,

1:26:22.834 --> 1:26:25.042
um, now it's to the point
where I can't even,

1:26:25.066 --> 1:26:26.867
you know,
get a text message back.

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:31.242
To be receiving text messages
and phone calls from family

1:26:31.266 --> 1:26:32.710
and asking
why he's not up there,

1:26:32.734 --> 1:26:34.009
it's a little worrisome.

1:26:34.033 --> 1:26:36.667
I mean, I've asked in the text
messages, "Are you good?"

1:26:37.734 --> 1:26:39.643
It's kind of no response.

1:26:39.667 --> 1:26:41.543
That's why I feel like
it'll just be better for me

1:26:41.567 --> 1:26:43.309
to drive over to his house now.

1:26:43.333 --> 1:26:46.309
Um, I just feel
like something's
definitely going on.

1:26:46.333 --> 1:26:47.367
I just... I don't know.

1:26:47.433 --> 1:26:49.073
I love the guy,
and I hope he's all right.

1:26:49.133 --> 1:26:50.367
That's all I really want.

1:26:55.367 --> 1:26:56.867
Well, let's see if he's here.

1:27:19.367 --> 1:27:21.567
[Rubi barking]

1:27:21.634 --> 1:27:22.667
There's Rubi.

1:27:24.634 --> 1:27:25.867
Holy [bleep]!
