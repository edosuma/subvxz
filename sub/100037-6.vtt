00:19.652 --> 00:21.287
Pretty windy up here.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.083
There's a lot of babies and
females off to the north

03:04.817 --> 03:07.120
and there's bulls to the south.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.586
I wanna sit back there.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.376
They're slowly making their way
over toward the musk ox herd.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.569
There's our bull I think.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.193
Even if we blow this,
it's better to get no ox

19:21.260 --> 19:22.928
than the wrong ox.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.630
And we need to get a bull.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.272
He's moving. That's him.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.941
I know it for a fact.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.043
I'm gonna take a shot from
this position right here.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.237
Dead?

20:05.938 --> 20:06.738
Dead.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.875
Nice one Dad.
