08:56.806 --> 08:58.242
Visually it's not

09:48.977 --> 09:51.214
I had broccoli here,
so what I did

09:51.214 --> 09:54.454
was char them to resemble
bone marrow.

09:54.454 --> 09:56.592
Well, Jose, so ambitious.

09:56.592 --> 09:58.697
I think you coulda just served
a potato gratin

09:58.697 --> 10:00.499

10:00.499 --> 10:02.838

and that's a beautiful dish.

10:02.838 --> 10:05.711

up and wear fancy suits, right?

10:08.248 --> 10:09.719
Yes.

10:09.719 --> 10:11.488
I wanted more jeans
and a T‐shirt in this dish.

10:11.488 --> 10:13.727

10:23.780 --> 10:26.151
I did red garnet sweet potatoes

10:26.151 --> 10:27.821

10:27.821 --> 10:30.426
It looks a little granular.

10:30.426 --> 10:32.163
The bacon's a little crispy.

10:32.163 --> 10:34.334
You could have peeled the ends
of the peas a little bit,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.371
because that's not a pleasant
texture to have in your mouth.

10:36.371 --> 10:38.442
So the most underwhelming thing
for me on that plate

10:38.442 --> 10:39.678
is the actual potato.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.649
Hmm. Yeah.

<i>First Kevin and now T.</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

41:56.494 --> 42:00.068
Ain't nobody safe.
Nobody.

42:00.068 --> 42:01.739
<i>GORDON: As a former runner‐up,</i>

42:01.739 --> 42:05.245
<i>I expected T to come back</i>
<i>full of swagger and skill.</i>

42:05.245 --> 42:07.918
<i>Sadly, she came back</i>
<i>with double the swagger,</i>

42:07.918 --> 42:09.755
<i>but only a fraction</i>
<i>of the skill.</i>

42:14.631 --> 42:16.635
<i>NARRATOR: Next time</i>
<i>on</i> Hell's Kitchen...

42:16.635 --> 42:19.373
As chefs,
there's no greater joy

42:19.373 --> 42:21.679
than letting our imagination
run wild.

42:21.679 --> 42:24.083
<i>NARRATOR: It's anything</i>
<i>but a fairy tale.</i>

42:24.083 --> 42:25.285
No more white wine.
That's enough.

42:25.285 --> 42:26.321
Talk to me.
Don't yell at me.

42:26.321 --> 42:27.489
Let's do it!

42:27.489 --> 42:29.561
My teeth is [bleep]
showing now.

42:29.561 --> 42:31.064
The wolf is here.

42:31.064 --> 42:33.168
<i>NARRATOR: Will a big,</i>
<i>bad wolf come calling?</i>

42:33.168 --> 42:34.571
(howls)

42:34.571 --> 42:36.976
<i>And set his sights</i>
<i>on a vulnerable target?</i>

42:36.976 --> 42:39.447
Baby girl. I was wondering
what's wrong with baby girl.

42:39.447 --> 42:41.819
Make sure you don't break down
again tonight, baby girl.

42:41.819 --> 42:44.357
<i>NARRATOR: And will his prey</i>
<i>actually fight back?</i>

42:44.357 --> 42:45.960
I'm nobody's [bleep]
baby girl.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.398
<i>NARRATOR: Or will a white</i>
<i>knight ride to the rescue?</i>

42:48.398 --> 42:49.735
It's a [bleep] honor.

42:49.735 --> 42:51.070
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>It's all next time...</i>

42:51.070 --> 42:52.741
I gotta fight for my homie.

42:52.741 --> 42:54.911
‐Ahh!
‐Oh, my God!

42:54.911 --> 42:57.449
<i>NARRATOR: On an episode where</i>
<i>there is no happy ending...</i>

42:57.449 --> 42:59.020
I see tears.
What happened?

42:59.020 --> 43:00.322
Didn't see this one coming,
did you?

43:00.322 --> 43:02.359
<i>NARRATOR: In Hell's Kitchen.</i>

43:02.359 --> 43:05.065
(wolf howls)
