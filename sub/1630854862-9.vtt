01:01.562 --> 01:03.689
<i>My husband and brother
were in an accident.</i>

01:03.689 --> 01:04.772
<i>Could you hold?</i>

01:04.772 --> 01:07.192
Please understand
the gravity of the situation.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.030
I haven't been able to speak with them.
I don't even know if they're okay.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.907
<i>Look outside, ma'am.</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:16.326
<i>You're not the only person trying
to connect with a loved one.</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:17.870
<i>You're going to have to wait.</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:27.754
They put me on hold.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.680
Listen, I don't want to upset you,
but I need to know what happened to them.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.809
Don't worry about it, Dorothy.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.437
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.148
I'm sure they'll come home to you
in one piece.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.817
<i>Mrs. Turner?</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:50.068
Yes, I'm here.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.197
<i>I'm ready for you now.
Please give me the patients' names.</i>

01:53.697 --> 01:55.908
Okay. Sean Turner and Julian Pearce.

01:57.034 --> 02:01.288
- <i>I can patch you up there if you want.</i>
- Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you so much.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.372
<i>Please hold.</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:03.916
<i>Hello?</i>

02:04.416 --> 02:06.668
Sean. Oh, Sean.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.630
Thank God. Are you okay?

02:09.630 --> 02:14.218
<i>Dorothy, I'm okay.
Listen, Dorothy, I need to see you.</i>

02:14.218 --> 02:16.136
<i>There's something we need to talk about.</i>

02:17.221 --> 02:18.222
<i>Anyone hear us?</i>

02:21.183 --> 02:24.186
Well, I'm with Leanne.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.359
Honey, what are we gonna do?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.570
I can't leave the house.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.156
<i>Honey,</i>

02:37.157 --> 02:39.826
<i>I don't think
I'll be discharged anytime soon.</i>

02:40.327 --> 02:41.537
<i>The hospital's crowded.</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:45.374
How long do you think?

02:46.583 --> 02:49.211
<i>I don't know. Days. Maybe a week.</i>

02:52.714 --> 02:54.800
Sean, I don't think that's gonna work.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.471
<i>Listen, Dorothy,
let me send you something.</i>

03:00.097 --> 03:02.975
<i>Tobe can bring over a basket of food,
so you don't have to worry.</i>

03:04.226 --> 03:06.019
I don't need food. I need you home.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.231
- <i>I can't do that right now.</i>
- No.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.483
<i>Let me do something for you.</i>

03:11.483 --> 03:14.403
<i>Prosciutto, black truffles,
all your favorites.</i>

03:14.403 --> 03:15.988
No, Sean.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.489
<i>I know, honey.</i>

03:18.824 --> 03:23.161
<i>Listen, 8:00 a.m. Tobe will stop by
and bring the food.</i>

03:24.371 --> 03:25.372
<i>Don't forget.</i>

03:26.540 --> 03:28.250
<i>Trust me. Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:31.295
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Yeah.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.013
We're okay
as long as we're close together.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.850
We can't let her see that we're afraid.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.020
We can pretend, okay?

03:52.733 --> 03:53.734
<i>Hello?</i>

03:54.318 --> 03:55.527
Hi, Dr. Wodell.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.988
It's Dorothy Turner calling again.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.490
<i>Hi, Dorothy. Just a sec.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:03.368
<i>Dorothy?</i>

04:04.077 --> 04:05.787
How are you feeling?

04:05.787 --> 04:06.872
<i>Leanne?</i>

04:07.497 --> 04:10.334
Did Dr. Wodell tell you
how close the knife was to your artery?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.836
It's a miracle you're still alive.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.089
<i>Dorothy's stronger
than both of us combined.</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:17.173
<i>She'll fight you.</i>

04:17.841 --> 04:19.051
Rest well, Sean.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.554
After you heal, you're gonna have to
build yourself a whole new life.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.973
That'll take some effort.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.772
Dorothy?

04:37.236 --> 04:38.487
I'll just stay here tonight.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.282
The storm might scare Jericho.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.493
I know that you're afraid without Sean.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.452
We're all right.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.542
We're all right. Okay.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.776
I thought it made more sense
to have the sofa facing the television.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.946
When did you do this?

06:04.239 --> 06:06.783
Couldn't sleep. I was too excited.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.496
I thought that maybe the three of us
could watch a movie.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.124
Okay.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.084
Only if you want to.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.878
No, I want to.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.047
Great.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.384
That'll be Tobe.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.262
Could you get the door?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.807
I think you should get it.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.851
Tobe and I--

06:34.394 --> 06:36.146
I need to use the bathroom anyway.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.527
I'm coming.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.365
Yes. Thank you so much, Tobe.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.120
We do miss them,
but the doctors say they're healing well.

07:35.998 --> 07:36.999
Yes.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.379
Okay, I will. I'll tell her.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.882
Okay, thanks again. See you soon.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.314
Tobe says hello.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.318
Could you help me with that basket?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.208
What should we watch?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.710
I'm fine with anything.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.545
Well, you pick.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.090
You can set it up upstairs,
and Jericho and I'll be up in a moment.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.345
Don't you think I know you by now?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.640
You're trying to distract me
so you can leave.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.892
Like you always do.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.727
Look outside.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.816
You really think Jericho and I
could get anywhere in my condition?

08:48.529 --> 08:51.031
If I could've left, I would've.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.452
We'll watch in here.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.293
Rainy days really are the best movie days.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.255
Should we watch something scary?

09:07.381 --> 09:10.133
<i>No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.</i>

09:10.133 --> 09:13.512
<i>Well my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too.</i>

09:13.512 --> 09:15.556
<i>Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?</i>

09:15.556 --> 09:19.309
<i>The slippers, yes! The slippers!</i>

09:19.309 --> 09:20.394
Leanne?

09:22.396 --> 09:23.397
Yes?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.483
I'm really not feeling great.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.235
<i>They're gone!</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:30.237
My back. My legs.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.367
I think I should probably take a pill
and knock out for a bit.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.415
Would you mind watching Jericho for a bit?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.587
Like, give him a bath,
read him some books.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.133
You sure you don't mind giving him to me?

09:52.718 --> 09:53.927
Of course not.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.555
I know you love him.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.516
- <i>...You have no power here.</i>
- <i>Begone, before somebody drops a house--</i>

10:18.452 --> 10:20.162
Why don't you go get the bath toys?

10:20.954 --> 10:24.041
You can bathe him
in yours while I rest. Yeah?

10:24.750 --> 10:25.751
Sure.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.303
Jericho, Mommy just has to go outside
and talk to Daddy,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.640
and then I'll come right back for you.
I promise.

10:41.642 --> 10:45.145
I just have to talk to Daddy,
and then I'm gonna get us out of here.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.065
We'll never have to see her again.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.070
You just be strong for a little while.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.991
I love you
more than I've ever loved anything.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.247
Hey. You ready?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.165
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.877
We're gonna go have a bath.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.422
There you go.

11:13.715 --> 11:14.800
There you go.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.788
Rest well, Dorothy.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.292
Say, "Bye, Mama."

11:49.209 --> 11:51.128
Bye.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.754
<i>Come here. Let me wash your hair.</i>

12:35.214 --> 12:39.885
<i>Jeri, put your head up like this.
What's that?</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:45.349
<i>Come here. No.</i>

13:34.857 --> 13:35.941
<i>What are you doing?</i>

14:20.402 --> 14:22.446
<i>What? That one?</i>

14:22.446 --> 14:23.530
<i>That one?</i>

14:24.031 --> 14:28.327
<i>Oh, yeah. That one. You want that.</i>

15:31.849 --> 15:35.978
- Hey. Hi.
- Dorothy.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.443
- God.
- Hey.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.528
Oh, my God.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.948
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Oh, God.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.659
What happened to you both?
Leanne do this to you?

15:50.659 --> 15:53.078
Kind of. She's fucking crazy.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.122
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Juju.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.206
Yeah.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.542
I missed you.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.170
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.921
That basket.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.883
What if Leanne had gotten to it
before I did?

16:05.883 --> 16:08.135
Tobe said
she's been avoiding him recently,

16:08.135 --> 16:11.430
so I figured if she heard his name,
she'd let you go to the door alone.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.015
He means something to her.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.190
Dottie.

16:22.608 --> 16:27.154
Sean... we need to do this.

16:27.779 --> 16:28.780
I know.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.365
What?

16:35.537 --> 16:36.872
Dottie.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.834
There's something
we need to talk to you about.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.464
Maybe we should
have this conversation someplace else.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.549
Let us take you to Frank's.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.927
Kidding? I'm not leaving.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.765
I know what I'm asking of you.
But you gotta trust me on this one.

16:54.765 --> 16:57.351
Trust you? Jericho's in there with her.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.524
Dottie.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.777
Enough! If you ask me one more time,
I'm getting out of this car.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.946
Okay. Okay.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.077
Julian, we're just gonna have to
have this conversation here.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.914
Dorothy, how much do you remember
about last August?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.251
August?

18:10.299 --> 18:11.675
Who told you that?

18:17.181 --> 18:19.308
What do you remember?
Where does your memory stop?

18:20.184 --> 18:21.935
Sean, how could you possibly know--

18:23.437 --> 18:26.899
I've been struggling with this for weeks.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.818
I wasn't ready then, but I'm ready now.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.738
Dorothy, I think I can help you.
What do you remember?

18:33.363 --> 18:34.364
Nothing.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.994
I don't remember anything.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.457
I took a guest spot on Gourmet Gauntlet
in Los Angeles.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.834
That's the reason they asked me
to host this season.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.085
Okay.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.713
I tried to talk about this
in the bedroom. Remember that?

18:49.713 --> 18:53.258
I don't know. What is this?
What are we even talking about?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.637
I should never have done the job.

18:56.637 --> 18:58.472
I think I knew that even then.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.100
I was just so tired.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.436
No one tells you
how hard it is to be a dad.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.522
And I'm not a natural parent.
Not like you are.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.315
I just wanted to get away,

19:08.315 --> 19:12.611
and I thought I should be allowed
to get away, if only for a little.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.530
And I guess I've always been a coward.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.616
Sean, if you're gonna tell me you slept
with some woman

19:17.616 --> 19:19.701
while you were in California,
you can just skip it,

19:19.701 --> 19:22.246
and we can talk about this
when our family is safe.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.959
Julian, what? What is it?

19:28.418 --> 19:31.880
You called me a couple days in.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.593
You told me you were struggling.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.681
I could hear it in your voice.

19:40.681 --> 19:43.308
Why would I say that? I wasn't struggling.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.768
You wouldn't remember.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.983
I knew you needed me.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.530
But I still decided not to come.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.576
Because I wanted to score some drugs,
I decided...

20:01.535 --> 20:04.413
I'm so sorry I didn't come.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.748
You both sound crazy.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.793
I didn't call you.

20:13.755 --> 20:14.590
What?

20:14.590 --> 20:16.133
<i>Juju. It's Dottie.</i>

20:18.010 --> 20:19.803
<i>I really wouldn't call
if it wasn't important,</i>

20:19.803 --> 20:23.974
<i>but I'm just having a really hard time.</i>

20:26.852 --> 20:31.857
<i>Jericho is just crying and crying,
and I have tried everything. And--</i>

20:34.359 --> 20:36.153
<i>I'm just really overwhelmed right now.</i>

20:37.613 --> 20:44.494
<i>So, maybe you could just come by, Juju,
for, like, even a couple hours.</i>

20:46.413 --> 20:49.583
<i>Okay. Just call me back, okay?</i>

20:50.751 --> 20:51.752
<i>Bye.</i>

20:53.170 --> 20:55.631
I don't know what's happening.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.593
After it happened,
we thought that Natalie could help.

21:00.135 --> 21:03.680
She said she knew of a new therapy
that had helped people.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.267
You gotta understand, Dorothy,
we didn't know how to get through to you.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.062
I mean, you were there, but you were gone,
you know?

21:10.062 --> 21:12.814
And you're the one
who always makes the hard decisions.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.566
What's going on?

21:15.526 --> 21:17.110
It doesn't make sense.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.947
Can someone tell me something
that just makes sense, please?

21:19.947 --> 21:22.908
I'm trying to. There was a doll.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.663
And it really worked for you.

21:28.497 --> 21:31.667
Seemed to help. You thought it was him.

21:34.419 --> 21:37.631
Just like that, we had Dorothy back.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.597
And I don't know
how long I thought it would last,

21:45.597 --> 21:50.394
but... I'd have let it gone on forever

21:50.394 --> 21:52.688
if it meant I could keep you with me.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.440
A doll?

22:00.112 --> 22:03.532
I thought a doll was who?

22:04.616 --> 22:05.617
Sean?

22:06.827 --> 22:08.787
Dorothy, I know
you're gonna blame yourself.

22:08.787 --> 22:11.665
It's who you are. But you can't do that.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.877
We were both so overwhelmed,

22:14.877 --> 22:17.504
and I had left you here
to deal with it all alone.

22:22.843 --> 22:25.596
It was just an accident.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.307
It was a freak accident.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.059
You-- Remember how hot it was that summer?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.104
The roads were starting to stick.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.028
You took him to the grocery store.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.198
Your hands were full.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.706
- What?
- I know you want to shut it away,

22:52.706 --> 22:54.583
but you have to remember now, Dorothy.

22:56.001 --> 22:59.004
Honey, it was just a mistake.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.675
Dottie, try and remember.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.112
<i>Mrs. Turner, are you all right?</i>

24:51.074 --> 24:53.202
Mrs. Turner, I'm a police officer.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.831
Would it be all right
if I asked about your son?

24:59.708 --> 25:01.668
It's Jericho, right?

25:05.297 --> 25:06.423
What happened?

25:09.593 --> 25:10.802
Do you remember?

25:28.779 --> 25:30.197
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

25:57.391 --> 25:58.392
Dorothy.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.229
Sweetie, please talk to me.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.862
Dorothy, come back.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.827
Dorothy, please come back.

26:25.419 --> 26:27.671
- Julian!
- Dorothy, stop!

26:29.590 --> 26:32.593
Dorothy, please, I love you. Stop.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.471
Dorothy! Jesus! Dorothy!

26:37.306 --> 26:38.432
Dorot--

26:40.267 --> 26:41.935
Jesus! Dorothy!

26:44.479 --> 26:47.941
No!

26:50.736 --> 26:54.156
Oh, God! Oh, no!

28:14.403 --> 28:16.238
Okay. We're here, Dottie. We're home.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.074
Leanne, come down here!

28:19.950 --> 28:21.702
We told her everything. It's over!

28:23.120 --> 28:24.121
Leanne!

28:24.872 --> 28:28.125
I'm right here. You don't need to shout.

28:29.835 --> 28:31.962
She knows the truth, Leanne. It's over.

28:33.255 --> 28:35.215
Jericho missed you today, Dorothy.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.300
Sean, look.

28:40.095 --> 28:42.014
Don't you wanna hold your son?

28:42.014 --> 28:42.973
It's a doll.

28:42.973 --> 28:45.809
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Nothing's funny, Sean.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.811
Just stop with your fucking games.

28:47.811 --> 28:48.896
Okay? This is done.

28:49.605 --> 28:50.522
We know about your tunnels

28:50.522 --> 28:53.609
and how you've been switching the baby
and the doll to fuck with us.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.694
You have nothing over us anymore.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.696
No one believes you.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.407
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

29:01.909 --> 29:02.910
Dorothy?

29:06.496 --> 29:08.957
I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

29:10.125 --> 29:13.003
And I am so sorry
that it had to happen this way.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.215
But now, you know everything.

29:17.716 --> 29:19.510
And you know what I've done for you.

29:20.302 --> 29:22.471
You need to get the hell out
of this house, Leanne.

29:23.138 --> 29:26.892
You are mentally unstable,
and you need to leave us alone now.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.354
When I found out
that it was your fault that he died...

29:30.354 --> 29:31.563
Now, Leanne!

29:31.563 --> 29:33.524
...I was so angry at you.

29:34.858 --> 29:37.152
Then I realized that that was my purpose.

29:38.278 --> 29:41.198
My purpose was to help you
fix this mistake.

29:41.198 --> 29:42.950
She's a fucking psychopath, Dorothy.

29:42.950 --> 29:44.243
Just ignore her.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.955
I can do extraordinary things, Dorothy.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.749
Things that are hard to believe sometimes.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.335
But the most extraordinary thing

29:53.335 --> 29:55.921
that I have ever done in my life
was for you.

29:57.089 --> 29:59.675
I brought your son back to life.

29:59.675 --> 30:01.009
Don't listen to her.

30:01.009 --> 30:04.388
Honey, it was never Jericho.
It was someone else's child.

30:04.388 --> 30:05.556
This doll is here,

30:05.556 --> 30:08.934
because Sean and Julian
have a hard time believing in things.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.645
I needed to punish them.

30:13.605 --> 30:17.109
So, I've sent Jericho back to the place
that he'll be without me.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.111
We found a family, Dorothy,

30:19.111 --> 30:21.905
looking for their baby
just a couple of states away.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.743
That's right, she stole that baby
from another mom, honey.

30:26.743 --> 30:29.204
Just to try and make us think
she was special.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.123
She must've hidden him somewhere now.

30:31.123 --> 30:34.293
She's manipulating you
like she did to all of us.

30:34.293 --> 30:37.796
They don't understand. They couldn't.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.132
But you can.

30:41.675 --> 30:44.011
A mother always knows her child.

30:46.138 --> 30:49.808
It was never Jericho, honey.
Please listen to me.

30:50.434 --> 30:52.936
There are things
that just can't be explained.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.190
Like the bond between a mother
and a child.

30:56.982 --> 30:58.901
Like life and death.

30:58.901 --> 30:59.985
Like me.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.156
But you know the truth, Dorothy,
don't you?

31:04.740 --> 31:08.243
Because you held him,
and you felt his heartbeat.

31:08.744 --> 31:11.246
And you know that that was Jericho.

31:11.246 --> 31:14.291
You know that that was your son, Dorothy.
You know.

31:15.042 --> 31:16.960
Dorothy, you believe me, don't you?

31:18.295 --> 31:21.256
She knows you're vulnerable,
and she's taking advantage.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.716
Don't listen to her.

31:23.926 --> 31:26.929
Dorothy, I can bring him back for good.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.349
Just shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!

31:31.558 --> 31:33.644
We'll never have to do this again.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.772
It'll just be you and me and him.

31:37.397 --> 31:39.024
Stay away from her.

31:40.359 --> 31:43.403
You once told me
that you would do anything for Jericho.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.614
Then here's your chance.

31:47.074 --> 31:49.284
All you have to do is say "yes."

31:50.118 --> 31:51.286
Don't do it.

31:52.287 --> 31:56.875
Just say "yes,"
and everything will be okay.

31:57.376 --> 32:00.045
I will give you everything that you want.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.173
Please, Dorothy.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.300
Just say "yes."

32:08.804 --> 32:09.805
Yes.
