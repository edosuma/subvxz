02:07.127 --> 02:10.820
My dream is for the
future of this planet

02:10.820 --> 02:12.166
to live forever.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.422
[clicking and whirring]

02:26.422 --> 02:29.183
Here we are. Day 3,003.

02:32.566 --> 02:35.327
Effects seem stable enough
to begin human testing

02:35.327 --> 02:36.708
in the next few weeks.

02:40.298 --> 02:43.163
I am extremely pleased
with the results.

02:44.474 --> 02:46.062
My days are long.

02:48.444 --> 02:50.239
To be honest, I can't
really tell the difference

02:50.239 --> 02:55.002
between night and
day any longer,

02:55.002 --> 02:57.384
[liquid sloshing]

02:57.384 --> 03:00.663
but it'll all be
worth it in the end.

03:02.837 --> 03:05.461
As you can see, the
chemical is binding

03:06.703 --> 03:08.774
more strongly than ever before.

03:08.774 --> 03:12.502
[clattering and beeping]

03:12.502 --> 03:15.954
And its longevity has
grown exponentially.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.993
The question is, do we continue

03:22.857 --> 03:24.514
to see how long it will last

03:26.827 --> 03:28.518
or do we start the testing now.

03:29.416 --> 03:32.936
It seems safe, safe enough,

03:32.936 --> 03:34.766
but whether or not
it's sustainable,

03:36.285 --> 03:38.321
well that's what's
keeping me up nights.

03:41.566 --> 03:44.845
[coughs] More tomorrow.

03:44.845 --> 03:48.158
[soft dramatic music]

03:50.368 --> 03:52.749
Is death just an illusion?

03:56.270 --> 04:00.274
Imagine what we could achieve
when our time is limitless.

04:01.413 --> 04:04.451
When our vision of the
world has no boundaries.

04:06.591 --> 04:09.490
Maybe then the
universe will awaken

04:10.629 --> 04:13.770

a new beginning.

Jaxxon Pierce here,

06:32.357 --> 06:35.118
World's Administration
reports, Divinity,

06:35.118 --> 06:37.845
with its miracle
anti-aging ingredients

06:37.845 --> 06:40.538
is the only clinical
proven formula

06:40.538 --> 06:42.540
for its effectiveness
in longevity

06:42.540 --> 06:45.957
and actually reducing
the formation of decay.

06:45.957 --> 06:48.304
That's right, lifetime
protection, folks.

06:48.304 --> 06:50.444
[dramatic music continues]

06:50.444 --> 06:55.449
- Bigger, stronger,

We're almost there, father.

07:13.916 --> 07:15.918
So close I can feel it.

07:18.127 --> 07:20.370
Just like he said
it would happen.

No matter if you're
male or female,

08:26.747 --> 08:30.682
you'll be at your
peak performance and
fullest potential.

08:30.682 --> 08:33.996
Sex doesn't matter,
but size does.

08:33.996 --> 08:37.206
You will never age
physically again.

How does it feel

09:51.591 --> 09:56.181

09:58.356 --> 09:59.840

Well, it's not complete.

10:03.672 --> 10:04.534

- One more moment, please,
'cause it's, this is important.

10:25.245 --> 10:28.110
It's very, it's very important.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.802
- It's time to take a break.
- Yeah.

the difference between...

13:51.106 --> 13:53.798
Then we continue to see
how long it will last

13:53.798 --> 13:57.112
until we start the testing now.

13:57.112 --> 13:59.148
It seems safe thus far.

14:02.151 --> 14:04.188
Whether or not it's sustainable,

14:04.188 --> 14:08.675
that's what keeps me
up nights. [coughs]

14:08.675 --> 14:10.988
Continue to find the chemicals

14:10.988 --> 14:14.094
helping all physical
attributes and longevity,

14:14.094 --> 14:18.996
but mental deterioration
continues at a normal rate.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.759

while interesting,

14:23.759 --> 14:25.140
has held up our human trials.

14:25.140 --> 14:29.938
Sometimes I have the
urge to try it on myself

14:29.938 --> 14:32.664
before my condition worsened.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.770
Hey, hey, Jaxxon.

14:35.944 --> 14:38.153
- Dad, what are you doing?

14:39.913 --> 14:41.121
- Daddy.
- Hey.

14:42.157 --> 14:43.675
Listen, I'm working, okay?

14:43.675 --> 14:44.849
Why don't you go find your

We are at the horizon of

58:13.006 --> 58:15.388
- Jaxxon, Rip!

58:15.388 --> 58:16.285
- Ah.

58:17.632 --> 58:19.806
Come on. [coughs]

58:20.945 --> 58:23.741
[beeping]

58:23.741 --> 58:25.743
- Settle down! [echoes]

58:25.743 --> 58:28.850
I told you!
[groaning]

58:28.850 --> 58:30.058
- Daddy.

58:30.058 --> 58:33.026
[clearing throat]

58:35.132 --> 58:37.893
Hey Jaxxon. [chuckles]

58:37.893 --> 58:39.343
- No.

[banging]

58:41.966 --> 58:44.831
[heavy breathing]

58:47.075 --> 58:48.283
- You failed me, son.

58:49.180 --> 58:50.078
- No!

58:52.770 --> 58:53.978
You failed us!

58:56.153 --> 58:58.845
You're the failure.

58:58.845 --> 59:00.847
You couldn't even save yourself!

59:02.262 --> 59:04.817
You left us! [echoes]

59:04.817 --> 59:06.439
You fucking left us!

59:06.439 --> 59:09.166
[intense music]

[clattering]

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.912
- Jaxxon.

01:00:44.882 --> 01:00:47.644

[growling]

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:08.457
How much longer do you want
this to go on for. [gargling]

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.425
- Such a disgusting creature.

01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:12.220
[snarling]

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.705
All this is because of you.

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.674
- The world was in
pain and misery.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.503
I lifted them up!

01:01:19.503 --> 01:01:23.369
I gave them meaning
to live. [snarling]

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:27.028
- Deep down inside, you
know you're no savior.

01:01:27.028 --> 01:01:28.615
[growling]

01:01:28.615 --> 01:01:31.584
You have to remove your
persona and let go.

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:34.104
- Goddamn it! You
keep saying that!

01:01:34.104 --> 01:01:35.105
Of what?

01:01:36.451 --> 01:01:39.074
- Your pain.
- My pain?

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:41.283
- Yes. Deep inside.

01:01:41.283 --> 01:01:43.216
- The pain.
- Let it go.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.600
[gasping]
- Daddy.

01:01:48.946 --> 01:01:50.603
[growling]

01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:52.329
- You're a coward
kill me now you fuck.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.437
Kill me now, you
fuck! [gargling]

01:01:57.437 --> 01:01:58.507
- Jaxxon?

01:01:58.507 --> 01:02:00.406
- [grunts] In here.

01:02:00.406 --> 01:02:03.961
[suspenseful music]

01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:06.205
[growling]

01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:12.038
Brother, please help me.

01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:16.146
[glass shattering]

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.287
- Wait here.

01:02:22.428 --> 01:02:24.741
[growling]

01:02:30.332 --> 01:02:32.403
- Untie me.

01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:35.337
Who did this to you?

01:02:35.337 --> 01:02:36.200
- These fucking brother's.

01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:38.271
Why?

01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:40.618
- Don't ask me why.
I have no idea.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.002
Look at me.

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:48.626
- I can't.
- I said, look at me.

01:02:49.455 --> 01:02:51.284
It's all going to be okay.

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:53.873
[heavy breathing]

01:02:53.873 --> 01:02:56.703
- Brother, what
did they do to you?

01:02:56.703 --> 01:02:59.948
- Fucking brother.
I'll pay for this.

01:02:59.948 --> 01:03:02.951
- You hold it together for me.

01:03:02.951 --> 01:03:04.504
Be strong, Rip.

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:07.128
We can't let them
ruin what our family's

01:03:07.128 --> 01:03:09.440
worked so long to achieve.

01:03:11.235 --> 01:03:13.824
Must never let them escape.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.413
Do you understand me?
They don't escape!

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:18.104
[clacking]

01:03:18.104 --> 01:03:20.003
- They'll pay for this.

01:03:20.003 --> 01:03:21.832
[suspenseful music]
[cracking]

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:23.489
- Rick, behind you!

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.526
[gun fires]
- Uh, no!

01:03:26.526 --> 01:03:28.425
- [growling] Kill her.

01:03:28.425 --> 01:03:30.151

01:03:44.786 --> 01:03:47.927
Rick, for me! What
are you doing?

01:03:47.927 --> 01:03:49.756
Get 'em! Go get them!

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.174
I said, go get them!

01:03:53.174 --> 01:03:54.658
There's no more fucking time!

01:03:56.004 --> 01:04:01.044
- Yes, brother, for our father.

01:04:02.528 --> 01:04:06.394
- [snorting] Fuck our father.

01:04:08.603 --> 01:04:10.432
[gasping]
- Hold on.

01:04:10.432 --> 01:04:13.401
[hyperventilating]

01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:17.025
Hold, hold on.

01:04:38.046 --> 01:04:38.909
- No!

01:05:13.012 --> 01:05:15.152

01:06:44.345 --> 01:06:47.348
- Oh my God! What,
what happened?

01:06:47.348 --> 01:06:49.729
[gasping and coughing]
- Let go.

01:06:49.729 --> 01:06:52.974
[soft dramatic music]

01:06:54.493 --> 01:06:57.599
[door slides and clanks]

01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:59.636
- Hang in there.
It's gonna be okay.

01:06:59.636 --> 01:07:01.948
[wheezing]

01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:04.986
Oh my God.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:09.335
- it's okay, let go. It's okay.

01:07:09.335 --> 01:07:10.164
- Brother.

01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:11.751
[sobbing]

01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:12.821
- It's okay.

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:21.416
[coughing]
- Hold on here.

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:23.073
- No!
- Help!

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:27.388
[gasping]
- No. [gasping]

01:07:27.388 --> 01:07:28.423
- Help!
- No!

01:07:30.218 --> 01:07:31.323
- No!

01:07:31.323 --> 01:07:33.670
[gasping and wheezing]

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:34.809
Just hold on.

01:07:35.982 --> 01:07:37.122
Here we go.

01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:38.744
[door clanks]

01:07:38.744 --> 01:07:40.504
[soft dramatic music]

01:07:40.504 --> 01:07:43.197
[groaning]

01:07:43.197 --> 01:07:46.510
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.650
[gasping and coughing]

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:52.689

[distorted whispering continues]

01:08:43.498 --> 01:08:45.811
[ticking]

01:08:50.885 --> 01:08:53.163
[eerie music continues]

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:57.857

01:08:57.857 --> 01:09:00.170
[groaning]

01:09:03.691 --> 01:09:06.521
[static buzzing]

01:09:10.215 --> 01:09:11.975
[clacking]
[whirring]

01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:14.529
[eerie music]

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.713
[eerie music continues]

01:09:25.713 --> 01:09:27.335
[tape clacking]

01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:29.993
[tape hissing]

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:35.861
[tape whirring]

01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:38.622
- My father was a bright
man with a weak body.

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:42.143
I loved him during the
short time we had together,

01:09:43.834 --> 01:09:47.838
but in the end, he
was a failure, a weak
man with a dream.

01:09:47.838 --> 01:09:50.634
So I had to put all
my efforts into action

01:09:50.634 --> 01:09:52.567
and finish what he started.

01:09:52.567 --> 01:09:54.397
Yes, it may not be his vision,

01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:58.366
but now it's my vision.

01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:00.679
My vision.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:04.924
And the world will
be better for it.

01:10:06.512 --> 01:10:10.102
He never made the breakthrough
that would fix Divinity.

01:10:10.102 --> 01:10:13.519
It was up to me to bring this
product to this next level.

01:10:14.486 --> 01:10:16.039
The old man was right, though.

01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:19.491
The answer did lie
in the fetal tissue.

01:10:21.355 --> 01:10:24.116
The ultimate sacrifice has
been made by those too young

01:10:24.116 --> 01:10:25.773
to have thoughts or memories.

01:10:27.671 --> 01:10:32.124
Because through my research,
I found that the solution

01:10:32.124 --> 01:10:35.127
can only be made from
early embryonic stages.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.062
[whimpering]
Thousands of doses

01:10:39.062 --> 01:10:42.272
could be created
from just one fetus.

01:10:43.342 --> 01:10:45.033
But the tissue
needed to be living.

01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:50.418
So the eggs had
to be fertilized,
developed into fetuses

01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:53.318
through a delicate and
controlled environment

01:10:53.318 --> 01:10:55.734
for the correct
extraction to be made.

01:10:55.734 --> 01:10:59.427
[dramatic music]

01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:02.327
To have eggs donated normally
wouldn't be an issue,

01:11:02.327 --> 01:11:05.261
but these needed to
be living beings.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.332
Finding and fertilizing
suitable hosts

01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:09.230
with a fetal tissue
was not easy.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:10.921
[whimpering]

01:11:10.921 --> 01:11:13.890
Not in a world with a
97% infertility rate.

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:18.274
Assuring cooperation of
the host was even harder.

01:11:19.689 --> 01:11:22.554
It involved creating novel
mental-controlled compounds.

01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:26.212
[dramatic music continues]

01:11:31.908 --> 01:11:35.601
[dramatic music continues]

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:39.847
We now have to ask the question,

01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:46.060
what is ethical and what isn't?

01:11:47.544 --> 01:11:50.927
Most people would question all
these choices I had to make.

01:11:50.927 --> 01:11:53.101
Choices my father
was afraid to make.

01:11:54.724 --> 01:11:56.553
But they won't question
the effectiveness

01:11:56.553 --> 01:12:00.488
of this new Divinity, not
when it saves their lives.

01:12:01.696 --> 01:12:05.182
True immortality of
both body and mind.

01:12:07.668 --> 01:12:09.290

[intense music]

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.262

01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:19.749
no one will ever have
to know about it.

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:23.339
[intense music continues]

01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:31.657

will have to humanity

outweighs everything.
