01:39.954 --> 01:41.828
It's crazy.

01:41.856 --> 01:45.726
While it's happening you don't
think you'll ever forget it.

01:45.766 --> 01:49.029
Then once it's over,
you can barely recall a thing.

01:49.064 --> 01:52.032
But it's them, right?
You're sure these are the guys who held you up?

01:52.067 --> 01:55.402
- Absolutely.
- These three definitely.

01:55.437 --> 01:57.604
This is the little prick
who spit in my face.

01:57.639 --> 02:01.242
The d'Alessio brothers...
a family of dagos out of Philly.

02:01.276 --> 02:04.178
Second-story men
who graduated to stick ups.

02:04.212 --> 02:07.582
They robbed bookbinder's
in '17, the restaurant.

02:07.616 --> 02:10.519
Killed two customers,
shot a waiter in the face.

02:10.553 --> 02:13.589
- Jesus Christ.
- Little bastard called me fat.

02:13.623 --> 02:15.623
They're fucking
killers, George.

02:15.658 --> 02:17.725
Sounds to me
like you got off easy.

02:17.759 --> 02:20.094
Why, sure.
I was just...

02:20.128 --> 02:22.263
I need to talk to my brother.

02:23.466 --> 02:25.066
Feel better, eh?

02:35.010 --> 02:39.447
These fucking guineas...
They're desperados, Nuck.

02:39.481 --> 02:41.282
We gotta track 'em down
and squash 'em

02:41.316 --> 02:44.185
before they spill more blood.

02:44.219 --> 02:46.720
It's not just blood
I'm worried about;

02:46.755 --> 02:49.924
it's ink.
You see the paper today?

02:49.958 --> 02:51.959
June doesn't like to upset me.

02:51.994 --> 02:55.162
Fletcher, this reformer
running for Mayor...

02:55.196 --> 02:57.465
He gave an interview
alleging corruption

02:57.499 --> 03:00.234
in both the Mayor's
and the sheriff's office.

03:00.269 --> 03:01.569
He mentioned me by name?

03:01.603 --> 03:03.638
"Has Mayor Bacharach
even questioned

03:03.672 --> 03:05.439
what sheriff Eli Thompson
was doing

03:05.473 --> 03:07.841
at an illegal casino
at 3:00 A.M.?"

03:07.876 --> 03:09.610
So I was there.
So what?

03:09.644 --> 03:11.611
How's he know I wasn't
answering a call?

03:11.646 --> 03:13.580
Because he knows, Eli.
Everybody does.

03:13.614 --> 03:15.483
It just never made
the paper before.

03:15.517 --> 03:16.884
Fuck 'em.

03:16.918 --> 03:19.086
Let them write what they want.

03:21.089 --> 03:22.556
The election, Eli...

03:22.591 --> 03:24.625
We gotta keep the tide
flowing in our direction.

03:24.659 --> 03:27.228
I'll get out then,
press the flesh,

03:27.262 --> 03:28.696
drum up some support.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.765
What about your spleen?
Dr. Surran says you should rest.

03:31.804 --> 03:35.302
How do you rest your spleen?

03:35.337 --> 03:37.705
- Come on, Grant.
- That water was cold.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.408
<i>Let's tell the ladies.
Oh, that was amazing!</i>

03:40.442 --> 03:43.577
Way out there.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.628
Do you believe in love at
first sight, Mrs. Schroeder?

04:03.264 --> 04:05.331
It's a rather romantic notion.

04:05.366 --> 04:08.970
It happened to me
the day I saw Warren.

04:09.004 --> 04:11.105
Senator Harding?

04:12.741 --> 04:14.943
I was 16,

04:14.977 --> 04:17.077
and he was the handsomest man

04:17.112 --> 04:19.547
I'd ever met.

04:19.581 --> 04:22.048
Of course he wasn't
senator yet.

04:22.084 --> 04:24.852
He ran the newspaper
back in Marion.

04:24.886 --> 04:29.122
Houdini's brother...
His name is Hardeen.

04:29.157 --> 04:31.124
And when I first heard harding,

04:31.159 --> 04:34.261
I thought it was him
running for president.

04:35.964 --> 04:37.931
He loves me

04:37.965 --> 04:40.266
and he loves his baby daughter.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.037
But America needs him

04:44.071 --> 04:47.507
and so I have to sacrifice.

05:04.057 --> 05:05.524
Marguerite.

05:05.558 --> 05:08.627
- Good morning.
- Madame Jeunet.

05:08.662 --> 05:11.330
This is a friend of
mine, miss Nan Britton.

05:11.364 --> 05:13.799
She needs a few outfits
for the season.

05:13.833 --> 05:17.502
<i>C'est gentil.
We exist to oblige.</i>

05:17.537 --> 05:19.338
Maryska.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.241
Maryska!

05:25.278 --> 05:28.080
See the mademoiselle
to the dressing room.

05:28.114 --> 05:30.382
This way.

05:33.051 --> 05:36.187
A cow waiting to be milked...

05:36.221 --> 05:38.189
the Polish girl.

05:38.223 --> 05:39.823
No grace, no charm.

05:39.857 --> 05:42.358
Well, I imagine
she's still learning.

05:42.393 --> 05:44.594
A head like a cabbage.

05:44.628 --> 05:47.630
<i>But she will work
for pennies.</i>

05:47.664 --> 05:50.633
You see what I am reduced to?

05:50.667 --> 05:54.637
Is business slow, ma'am?

05:57.741 --> 06:00.810
My dear Marguerite,

06:00.844 --> 06:02.745
how you have blossomed.

06:02.808 --> 06:06.348
Mr. Thompson is quite
generous with his attentions.

06:06.382 --> 06:08.316
He does treat me well.

06:08.351 --> 06:11.920
The finest things
for the finest ladies,

06:11.954 --> 06:14.556
as it must be here.

06:14.590 --> 06:17.092
But the cost is very high,

06:17.126 --> 06:19.294
<i>and then on top
I must pay.</i>

06:19.328 --> 06:22.864
- Pay whom?
- Mr. Thompson of course.

06:22.898 --> 06:25.933
Oh, you mean the city.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.637
I am told now
I must pay double.

06:29.672 --> 06:31.205
Everyone must.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.374
I have saved nothing,
Marguerite.

06:33.409 --> 06:36.377
All to run the shop.

06:36.412 --> 06:38.580
I am a woman alone.

06:38.614 --> 06:40.682
You understand this.

06:40.716 --> 06:42.817
Can you not speak
with your alderman?

06:42.851 --> 06:45.920
You can speak for me...

06:45.954 --> 06:48.156
to the man who gives you
his attention.

06:48.190 --> 06:51.826
I... I wouldn't know
what to say.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.963
Say that he is handsome;
How happy he makes you;

06:55.997 --> 06:59.700
And how can you buy the things
that make you pretty for him

06:59.734 --> 07:02.503
if there is no belle femme?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.672
Help me, Marguerite.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.977
You have power
you do not suspect.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.848
Oh bonjour, madame.

07:14.882 --> 07:17.451
Leave no stone unturned.

07:17.485 --> 07:19.286
You and your men
wire every department

07:19.321 --> 07:20.988
from Philly to Pittsburgh.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.491
- You should also write to...
- Nucky.

07:23.525 --> 07:26.461
Jesus. A little notice
would've been nice.

07:26.495 --> 07:29.229
- I sent a telegram.
- We have received nothing.

07:29.264 --> 07:32.165
I will call the Western
union to complain.

07:33.434 --> 07:35.434
I'd offer you coffee,
but it looks like

07:35.469 --> 07:37.904
you've already helped yourself.

07:37.938 --> 07:41.174
The train... the dining
car was out of service.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.510
- You haven't been home?
- I thought I should see you first.

07:46.446 --> 07:49.248
<i>- Have them send up a steak.
- Ja.</i>

07:54.655 --> 07:56.489
So you're here.

07:56.524 --> 08:00.060
- I assume you've accepted my offer?
- With conditions.

08:02.062 --> 08:05.364
My friend Richard harrow...
You met him in Chicago.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.832
- The man in the iron mask?
- He's a war hero.

08:07.866 --> 08:10.770
- I'd like him to join me.
- What's under there?

08:10.802 --> 08:14.405
He's missing
his cheekbone, his jaw.

08:14.439 --> 08:16.809
Basically the whole left side
of his face is gone.

08:16.841 --> 08:18.242
And he's still alive?

08:19.611 --> 08:21.749
Medicine, huh?

08:23.315 --> 08:25.549
A lot of fellas still alive
probably shouldn't be.

08:25.584 --> 08:28.185
Well, I know a few myself.

08:30.255 --> 08:32.957
- The d'Alessio brothers out of Philly.
- Another condition:

08:32.991 --> 08:36.559
We keep what we discuss
only between us.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.597
Wait outside.

08:54.212 --> 08:57.147
So these are the guys
that robbed the casino?

08:57.181 --> 08:59.182
<i>And O'Neill as well.</i>

08:59.217 --> 09:04.121
Ignacious, Sixtus, Leo...

09:04.155 --> 09:06.689
<i>- They're all named after popes.
- Write the Vatican,</i>

09:06.724 --> 09:09.158
see if they know
where they are.

09:16.837 --> 09:19.135
When I find them...

09:22.539 --> 09:24.006
What do you want me to do?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.109
You need me to spell it out?

09:26.143 --> 09:28.343
I'd like to hear you say it.

09:28.378 --> 09:30.679
Why?

09:33.216 --> 09:35.777
Politician to the last, huh?

09:37.188 --> 09:40.057
What, you don't say it, you
don't have to deny it later?

09:40.091 --> 09:44.295
Or are you just trying
to kid yourself?

09:44.329 --> 09:45.809
About what?

09:45.831 --> 09:48.165
The fact that
you're a murderer, Nuck.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.636
<i>That is what you
want me to do, right?</i>

09:52.671 --> 09:54.538
Kill them?

09:57.075 --> 09:59.442
Yes.

10:12.656 --> 10:14.490
Even the kid?

10:32.376 --> 10:35.044
I'm gonna go eat my steak.

11:04.476 --> 11:06.610
- Gentlemen.
- A.R.

11:06.645 --> 11:08.679
These are the fellas
I told you about.

11:08.713 --> 11:11.515
This is Leo d'Alessio,

11:11.549 --> 11:14.318
- his brother Ignacious.
- And Mickey Doyle.

11:14.352 --> 11:16.587
An honor,
Mr. Rothstein.

11:16.621 --> 11:17.954
So you've heard of me.

11:17.989 --> 11:20.457
- Naturally.
Who ain't, huh? - Yeah.

11:23.427 --> 11:24.827
And what is it you've heard?

11:24.862 --> 11:27.769
<i>- Good stuff, you know.
- That I'm honest?</i>

11:27.798 --> 11:30.366
That you'll always
get a square deal?

11:30.401 --> 11:33.103
Sure, that's why we're here.

11:33.138 --> 11:36.840
A reputation takes
a lifetime to build

11:36.874 --> 11:39.409
and only seconds to destroy.

11:50.970 --> 11:53.257
<i>I understand you're interested in
the liquor business.</i>

11:53.291 --> 11:55.225
We's interested in makin' dough.

11:55.259 --> 11:57.259
Piles of it.

11:58.428 --> 12:00.763
Eight ball, $500.

12:01.632 --> 12:03.499
<i>You break.</i>

12:08.640 --> 12:10.174
There are two ways
to make money

12:10.209 --> 12:12.243
in the alcohol business.

12:12.277 --> 12:15.480
One is to take cheap rotgut
whiskey, dilute it and sell it.

12:15.514 --> 12:18.482
<i>- I was doing good with that myself.
- That's the stupid way,</i>

12:18.517 --> 12:20.952
in which I have no interest.

12:24.656 --> 12:28.626
There's a growing demand for good
whiskey in the United States.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.362
And I'm not talking
about the swill

12:30.396 --> 12:32.797
you stirred up
in your chamberpot.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.134
I'm talking about the
best scotch from Britain.

12:37.169 --> 12:40.437
There's a fortune to be
made from importing it.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.877
It'll be the chic thing to have
good whiskey when you have guests

12:45.911 --> 12:49.681
and the rich will vie
with one another to serve it.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.553
I want to set up a business
for importing scotch.

12:55.587 --> 12:58.055
We'll have ships
with crews we can trust

12:58.089 --> 13:00.357
who'll sail it from
the distilleries in Europe

13:00.391 --> 13:02.626
and unload it outside
the three-mile limit.

13:02.660 --> 13:04.494
All we have to do
is smuggle it ashore.

13:04.528 --> 13:06.062
That's where you mugs come in.

13:06.097 --> 13:08.932
The ports of Atlantic City
are ideal for distribution

13:08.966 --> 13:10.734
to the entire eastern seaboard.

13:10.769 --> 13:13.303
The only problem is the man
who runs that city.

13:13.337 --> 13:17.974
Normally I'd make a deal
with such a man,

13:18.008 --> 13:21.978
cut him in as a partner,
but I find Nucky Thompson

13:22.012 --> 13:25.380
to be greedy and unreasonable.

13:27.183 --> 13:30.520
<i>Nothing a bullet in the eye won't fix.</i>

13:32.889 --> 13:35.057
If you'll each sign
those forms,

13:35.091 --> 13:38.394
I'll take it as your acquiescence
to our new arrangement.

13:39.996 --> 13:42.998
- What are they?
- Life insurance policies.

13:43.032 --> 13:45.201
There's a half a million
on each of you.

13:45.235 --> 13:47.003
You'll be handling

13:47.037 --> 13:49.205
<i>large amounts of my money,
gentlemen.</i>

13:49.239 --> 13:51.741
It's my assurance
you won't chisel me.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.478
Think of it as an incentive

13:55.512 --> 13:57.846
<i>not to screw
things up.</i>

14:13.696 --> 14:15.814
I'll show you out.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.907
Do you know
what the nice thing is

14:25.942 --> 14:27.876
about the Bronx zoo, Charlie?

14:29.411 --> 14:32.513
There's bars between you
and the monkeys.

14:41.457 --> 14:43.424
Finally asleep.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.492
I could've read them
some more of this.

14:45.527 --> 14:48.128
You seem to be
enjoying it yourself.

14:48.163 --> 14:49.830
"The wonderful love magnet...

14:49.865 --> 14:51.298
As long as I carry it,

14:51.333 --> 14:53.633
every living thing I meet
will love me dearly."

14:53.667 --> 14:56.602
That would make your election
easier, wouldn't it?

14:56.636 --> 14:59.938
<i>- Certainly cheaper.
- Is winning expensive?</i>

14:59.972 --> 15:01.989
Not as expensive as losing.

15:02.008 --> 15:04.543
And will Mr. harding
be president?

15:04.577 --> 15:06.011
That depends.

15:06.045 --> 15:09.148
Are you planning to vote for him?

15:09.182 --> 15:12.852
I've perhaps seen him in not
the most flattering light.

15:12.886 --> 15:16.788
- You mean the girl.
- Her name is Nan.

15:16.830 --> 15:20.761
If we only elected good men,
we'd never have leaders.

15:21.993 --> 15:23.961
If not good, then what
should they be?

15:23.995 --> 15:27.565
Useful... to those
who support them.

15:29.935 --> 15:33.671
I was speaking with
madame Jeunet today.

15:33.705 --> 15:37.008
- Oh? - She says she's
going to lose the shop.

15:38.677 --> 15:40.311
It's a pricey location.

15:40.345 --> 15:43.547
Apparently she's having
trouble with the city.

15:43.582 --> 15:46.717
Then she should talk
to her alderman.

15:47.396 --> 15:50.632
She did. It didn't help.

15:54.492 --> 15:57.805
Maybe there's something the county treasurer could do.

15:59.797 --> 16:02.532
- Did she ask you to bring this up?
- No.

16:02.566 --> 16:05.602
<i>Then why are
we discussing it?</i>

16:05.636 --> 16:08.743
She showed me a kindness
and I thought to return it.

16:08.772 --> 16:12.408
I made her hire you, Margaret.
Kindness didn't come into it.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.109
Then you should recompense her

16:14.144 --> 16:16.211
for the burden
you made her carry.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.115
What did she tell you exactly?

16:20.150 --> 16:23.052
Only that the money
she pays has increased

16:23.086 --> 16:25.054
and it's more
than she can afford.

16:25.088 --> 16:27.522
Then she shouldn't be doing
business in Atlantic City,

16:27.557 --> 16:30.818
- Because that's what it costs.
- But if you set the price...

16:30.826 --> 16:33.394
Margaret, this is not
a suitable topic.

16:33.429 --> 16:35.230
I wasn't aware of that.

16:38.134 --> 16:40.869
You're aware now.

16:50.845 --> 16:53.214
Will you not be staying

16:55.884 --> 16:57.885
I have an early meeting.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.895
I painted this last October.

17:07.930 --> 17:11.432
- She was an actress in
the vaudeville. - Huh.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.701
It's pretty.

17:15.436 --> 17:17.304
This...

17:17.339 --> 17:19.705
There's a lyrical quality.

17:19.757 --> 17:23.810
It's reminiscent of Mary Cassatt.

17:23.845 --> 17:26.681
Do you think your friend
is visiting soon?

17:26.714 --> 17:28.483
The art dealer?

17:28.517 --> 17:30.985
Oh, he's abroad
at the moment... Paris.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.854
<i>The city of light.</i>

17:36.192 --> 17:37.559
Oh, God damn it.

17:37.593 --> 17:40.962
<i>- I broke the cork.
- Here.</i>

17:44.234 --> 17:48.002
<i>There.</i>

17:48.037 --> 17:50.471
Oh my, you uncivilized artists.

17:50.506 --> 17:53.441
Laughing )

17:53.476 --> 17:55.710
1918...

17:55.746 --> 17:58.947
That's the year we met you.

18:03.686 --> 18:06.554
<i>L right, save some
for your jealous husband.</i>

18:11.661 --> 18:13.628
Mm.

18:23.238 --> 18:24.842
Come.

18:38.754 --> 18:40.688
It's okay, darling.

18:40.722 --> 18:42.657
I don't bite.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.727
- I, uh...
- Everyone in Paris is doing it.

18:54.236 --> 18:56.796
Hello?

18:56.805 --> 18:59.206
<i>Ange?</i>

18:59.241 --> 19:02.543
<i>Angela, it's me.</i>

19:02.577 --> 19:04.378
Hello?

19:04.412 --> 19:06.280
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>

19:06.314 --> 19:08.382
<i>It's me.</i>

19:14.255 --> 19:16.123
Why is the door locked?

19:16.157 --> 19:18.025
We've had intruders
in the neighborhood.

19:18.060 --> 19:22.263
- Where's the baby?
- He's sleeping.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.605
Jimmy, my God.

19:30.639 --> 19:33.374
You're having a party?

19:33.408 --> 19:35.309
We're just visiting.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.182
May I pour you some wine?

19:41.216 --> 19:43.684
I heard that's
against the law w.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.826
Well, it is getting late
and, uh, you have

19:51.860 --> 19:53.427
that sitting in the morning.

19:53.462 --> 19:54.895
Oh yes.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.932
<i>A wedding portrait.</i>

19:57.967 --> 20:00.101
<i>Lithuanian couple.</i>

20:07.143 --> 20:09.911
Well, it was nice
to see you, old boy.

20:09.946 --> 20:12.213
Welcome home again.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.736
- You should have told me
you were coming. - I did.

20:37.239 --> 20:40.040
Goddamn Western union!

20:45.914 --> 20:49.983
- What... what are you doing?
- I'm kissing you.

20:50.018 --> 20:51.885
Wait... You show up
out of nowhere,

20:51.920 --> 20:53.454
not a phone call for months...

20:53.489 --> 20:55.689
Ange, look, I'm home okay?
For good.

20:56.892 --> 20:59.927
- You're hurting me!
- I missed you.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.366
Yes, I will.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.067
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.642
They only had the plain ones...

21:51.677 --> 21:53.911
That was Western Union.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.113
They just got a call
from Nucky Thompson's Butler

21:56.147 --> 22:00.450
inquiring about a wire
from James Darmody.

22:00.484 --> 22:03.252
They said it was
passed on to you.

22:04.621 --> 22:08.256
- Oh my God.
- What is the meaning of this?

22:08.291 --> 22:10.625
I have it here.

22:14.263 --> 22:17.065
- I was going to give it to you.
- Then why didn't you?

22:22.839 --> 22:25.974
"Arriving Thursday,
11:00 A.M. train."

22:28.444 --> 22:31.546
- That was yesterday.
- I'm sorry, it slipped my mind.

22:31.580 --> 22:34.682
You're either
incompetent or a liar.

22:34.716 --> 22:36.884
I won't stand for it
either way, Agent Sebso.

22:36.919 --> 22:41.189
- We've been so... - I will
not stand for it either way!

22:41.223 --> 22:43.458
Why was this hidden?

22:45.194 --> 22:48.163
Because I'd like
to keep my job.

22:48.197 --> 22:49.965
Supervisor Elliot...

22:49.999 --> 22:53.668
He thinks we're being obsessive
about the Hans Schroeder case,

22:53.703 --> 22:56.438
about Nucky Thompson.

22:56.472 --> 22:58.340
We have a witness
that can place

22:58.374 --> 23:00.709
Darmody at the scene
of the murders.

23:02.211 --> 23:03.945
I wasn't thinking.

23:11.720 --> 23:16.091
You kill a snake by cutting
off the head, Agent Sebso.

23:16.125 --> 23:18.026
The supervisor?

23:18.060 --> 23:20.495
Nucky Thompson!

23:20.529 --> 23:22.774
Darmody gives him up,
this entire city,

23:22.812 --> 23:27.402
this Sodom, will be
cleansed all at once.

23:27.436 --> 23:29.404
There's coal in the ground,

23:29.438 --> 23:33.775
lumber in the forests,
cattle in the fields.

23:33.776 --> 23:35.410
What sound does the cow make?

23:35.444 --> 23:37.045
- Moo!
- That's right.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.347
You ride that train,
you look out the window,

23:39.381 --> 23:42.347
you don't see anything but
opportunity from coast to coast.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.510
And now he's returned to this one.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.954
And now I'm home, Ange,
where I belong.

23:49.290 --> 23:50.824
When you feel like showing up.

23:50.858 --> 23:53.727
I had business out west.

23:55.162 --> 23:57.463
I told you, but that's...
that's all taken care of.

23:57.498 --> 23:59.432
So now what?

23:59.467 --> 24:02.535
Now our prospects
are looking up.

24:02.569 --> 24:05.404
- Nucky made me an offer.
- Assistant clerk?

24:05.438 --> 24:08.780
Let's just say that we're out
of this dump in no time flat.

24:08.818 --> 24:12.411
Marven gardens, those
beach houses on Ventnor...

24:12.445 --> 24:17.149
<i>How does that sound?</i>

24:19.252 --> 24:21.453
<i>Hello?</i>

24:22.522 --> 24:24.323
Okay okay.

24:24.357 --> 24:26.057
Sweetie, come here.

24:26.092 --> 24:29.460
Yeah, just keep him there.

24:29.495 --> 24:31.896
Bye.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.432
- Mush!
- No, no mush today.

24:34.466 --> 24:36.067
Eggs.

24:36.102 --> 24:39.604
- Who was that?
- It was my mother.

24:39.638 --> 24:42.373
I got to go see her.
Come on, champ.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.862
What are you doing?

25:06.897 --> 25:08.930
I'm making more coffee.

25:30.719 --> 25:32.654
Let's have another baby.

25:34.190 --> 25:37.293
What do you say?
You want a little brother, c?

25:37.327 --> 25:40.163
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

25:41.532 --> 25:43.734
Then it's settled.

25:48.272 --> 25:51.808
Your stomach is growling.

25:51.809 --> 25:53.643
Are you hungry?

25:53.677 --> 25:56.346
I wouldn't mind
eating you for lunch.

25:58.583 --> 26:01.286
Maybe for dessert.

26:15.601 --> 26:18.569
Got any coffee left?

26:18.604 --> 26:20.813
I can manage that.

26:58.343 --> 27:01.412
- Oh! Fuck!
- I wasn't sure if you took cream.

27:01.446 --> 27:04.515
<i>It's not there, dear.</i>

27:04.550 --> 27:06.151
- You fucking twat.
- Hey!

27:06.185 --> 27:08.453
That's my mother
you're talking to.

27:08.487 --> 27:10.821
My apologies.

27:15.660 --> 27:17.328
So you're Luciano.

27:17.362 --> 27:19.363
My mother told me
a lot about you.

27:19.397 --> 27:21.298
We're very close, Charles.

27:21.332 --> 27:23.100
Plus we have a mutual friend

27:23.134 --> 27:24.434
in Chicago.

27:24.469 --> 27:27.137
Al Capone says hello.

27:27.171 --> 27:30.140
That's a lot of baloney.
Capone's no pal of mine.

27:30.174 --> 27:31.908
You're right.
Actually he didn't say hello.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.277
He said I should blow
your fucking brains out.

27:34.311 --> 27:36.747
I'd consider it a great
favor if you didn't.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.082
Get dressed.
We're gonna take a ride.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.386
- To where?
- Someplace they won't find you.

27:53.331 --> 27:55.231
Come on, move it.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.239
It don't gotta be
like this, you know?

28:02.273 --> 28:04.308
Tell Nucky
I'll talk to a.R.,

28:04.342 --> 28:06.777
call off the d'Alessios.

28:06.812 --> 28:08.546
- What?
- We'll cut him in.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.581
There's plenty
to go around for every...

28:10.616 --> 28:12.751
Drop the gun!

28:12.785 --> 28:14.320
Now.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.562
James Darmody,
you're under arrest.

28:28.599 --> 28:30.834
What are you smiling at?

28:30.868 --> 28:33.170
You fellas.

28:33.204 --> 28:36.507
- Youse are a sight for sore eyes.
- Hands on the wall.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.609
<i>Fuck.</i>

28:40.445 --> 28:43.047
Mid-July and they're
all over the place already.

28:43.081 --> 28:45.181
How am I supposed
to compete with this guy?

28:45.216 --> 28:47.716
That's the spirit,
Mr. Mayor.

28:47.761 --> 28:49.918
I want these placards
taken down.

28:49.952 --> 28:52.354
Any shop that posts one
gets a $25 fine.

28:52.388 --> 28:55.123
- Can we do that?
- We can do whatever we want.

28:55.157 --> 28:58.593
- When's Eli coming back?
- Stitches opened up.

28:58.627 --> 29:01.062
Doc Surran said this'll probably
set him back another month.

29:01.097 --> 29:02.630
It gets better
and better, doesn't it?

29:02.665 --> 29:04.532
He's left a big void,
I'll tell you that.

29:04.567 --> 29:06.774
He's not dead, Halloran.

29:06.803 --> 29:09.972
I know, but the men,
the other deputies,

29:10.007 --> 29:11.809
they're gonna need
some guidance...

29:11.842 --> 29:13.810
Schedules, assignments,
that kind of thing.

29:13.844 --> 29:15.511
Can't Eli handle that?

29:15.546 --> 29:17.180
Not in the state he's in.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.315
What are you trying to say?

29:19.349 --> 29:23.419
That I think
I should be in charge.

29:23.454 --> 29:26.188
- Oh, you do?
- I've got the most experience

29:26.223 --> 29:28.024
and the other fellas
look up to me.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.393
Fine, you're acting sheriff.

29:30.427 --> 29:32.662
Really?

29:32.696 --> 29:34.830
- Should I reconsider?
- No no.

29:34.865 --> 29:37.600
No.

29:37.634 --> 29:39.101
Thanks, Nucky.

29:39.136 --> 29:41.003
I know we've had
our differences,

29:41.038 --> 29:43.940
but I want you to know
that I'm here for you,

29:43.974 --> 29:46.909
now and in November.

29:46.977 --> 29:48.911
What does that mean?

29:48.946 --> 29:51.681
Have you thought
about the future?

29:51.715 --> 29:53.783
It certainly sounds
like you have.

29:53.817 --> 29:56.219
In regards to Eli, I mean.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.488
The election's right around the
corner and he's hurt, weak,

29:59.523 --> 30:02.358
the reformers
are alleging corruption.

30:02.392 --> 30:06.095
I mean you've seen the
articles yourself, right?

30:06.129 --> 30:09.665
All I'm saying is that
I'm at your service

30:09.699 --> 30:12.234
should you need.

30:13.836 --> 30:16.705
- I was at the picture show.
- Which one?

30:16.739 --> 30:19.174
- "Wagon tracks."
- What was the plot?

30:19.208 --> 30:21.710
Are you sure you want
me to ruin the ending?

30:21.744 --> 30:23.879
We can do this all day,
Mr. Darmody.

30:23.913 --> 30:25.981
It feels like
we already have been.

30:27.684 --> 30:29.584
You're proposing

30:29.619 --> 30:33.154
that on the night
of January 17, 1920,

30:33.188 --> 30:35.155
you were in
a moving picture show

30:35.190 --> 30:37.458
from 7:00 P.M.
until 11:30 P.M.?

30:37.492 --> 30:39.894
That's right.

30:41.330 --> 30:44.632
The running time of the film
is only 78 minutes.

30:44.666 --> 30:46.934
I fell asleep.

31:01.816 --> 31:05.051
You have a child
out of wedlock.

31:05.086 --> 31:07.421
Is his mother not fit to marry?

31:07.455 --> 31:09.656
That's none of your business.

31:09.691 --> 31:12.660
What's the name of the William s.
Hart character in the movie?

31:12.694 --> 31:15.496
- Buckskin? Buck-something.
- You're not sure?

31:15.530 --> 31:17.464
We're engaged.
We're going to be married.

31:17.499 --> 31:21.034
Your aim at making her
a respectable woman.

31:23.605 --> 31:25.272
How do you know Hans Schroeder?

31:25.306 --> 31:27.474
I don't know Hans Schroeder.

31:27.508 --> 31:30.410
- Mrs. Schroeder? Margaret?
- I don't know these people.

31:30.444 --> 31:33.146
Lucy Danziger, she's a
dancer at Ziegfeld follies.

31:33.180 --> 31:35.181
- You know her?
- It's Nucky's girlfriend.

31:35.216 --> 31:36.816
Then what is the relationship

31:36.850 --> 31:39.019
between Mr. Thompson
and Mrs. Schroeder?

31:42.223 --> 31:45.992
You want to know who Nucky
Thompson is fucking,

31:46.027 --> 31:48.128
why don't you ask him?

31:56.904 --> 31:59.372
This shipment of alcohol
that Mr. Thompson sold

31:59.406 --> 32:01.541
to Arnold Rothstein,

32:01.575 --> 32:03.609
the shipment that was
being transported

32:03.644 --> 32:05.944
the night of January 17th...

32:05.979 --> 32:08.546
- "Wagon tracks."
- How do you know Al?

32:08.581 --> 32:10.215
- I don't know any Al.
- From Chicago?

32:10.249 --> 32:12.216
You've got I
all mixed up, officer.

32:18.926 --> 32:21.929
Did Mr. Thompson have
Hans Schroeder murdered

32:21.963 --> 32:24.331
because he's in love
with Schroeder's wife?

32:29.403 --> 32:32.838
The men in the woods...
How many did you kill?

32:34.749 --> 32:36.708
I went to the movies.
I fell asleep.

32:36.743 --> 32:38.810
I got up. I walked home.
I went to bed.

32:38.844 --> 32:41.146
You wanna charge me, charge me.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.248
I've got nothing else to say.

32:43.282 --> 32:46.585
I thought you might find
some satisfaction

32:46.620 --> 32:49.955
in living long enough to see
your son grow into a man.

32:49.990 --> 32:54.192
- You don't got anything on me.
- Don't I?

33:07.974 --> 33:09.241
Billy?

33:09.275 --> 33:11.610
- Jimmy?
- Jesus Christ.

33:11.644 --> 33:13.212
They were gonna send me
up the river, Jimmy.

33:13.246 --> 33:16.115
- What did you say to them, Billy?
- Fucking rahway.

33:16.149 --> 33:17.754
- What'd you tell them?
- Jimmy!

33:17.784 --> 33:20.052
- Billy, what'd you say to...
- Jimmy!

33:20.087 --> 33:22.188
Fuck!

33:24.057 --> 33:26.191
The old days, it was different.

33:26.226 --> 33:28.994
You could count on people
to vote the party line.

33:29.029 --> 33:30.730
Now these democrats come along,

33:30.772 --> 33:32.631
make big promises.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.533
And you're concerned.

33:34.567 --> 33:37.603
Enough not to take
anything for granted.

33:37.637 --> 33:41.873
I wish there was a way
I could help.

33:41.908 --> 33:43.508
There is.

33:43.543 --> 33:47.279
You can help us get
the women's vote.

33:47.313 --> 33:51.683
Shouldn't you wait until the
amendment actually passes?

33:51.717 --> 33:53.952
I'm an eternal optimist.

33:56.222 --> 33:58.056
Speak to your friends,

33:58.091 --> 34:00.826
the temperance league,
other women's organizations.

34:00.860 --> 34:03.764
I'm not much of an orator.

34:03.796 --> 34:05.563
I've seen you speak.

34:05.598 --> 34:07.999
You comport yourself very well.

34:08.033 --> 34:09.467
When was that?

34:09.501 --> 34:12.703
At my birthday
with senator edge.

34:12.737 --> 34:15.106
Oh, that was merely banter.

34:15.139 --> 34:18.876
He's a United States senator and
you wiped the floor with him.

34:23.715 --> 34:26.116
Seriously, would you
be willing to speak

34:26.150 --> 34:28.284
on behalf of the party?

34:30.455 --> 34:34.324
- I suppose so, but...
- But what?

34:36.962 --> 34:39.897
Do you not wish me
to dress well?

34:39.931 --> 34:41.665
What do you mean?

34:41.699 --> 34:44.935
Do you not wish me
to look attractive?

34:44.969 --> 34:47.103
Of course I do.

34:47.138 --> 34:50.206
I mean you are,
whatever you're wearing.

34:51.876 --> 34:54.978
- Nucky, you have a call.
- All right.

34:56.246 --> 34:59.883
Madame Jeunet knows
what suits me.

34:59.918 --> 35:02.753
She knows how to
make me look pretty.

35:02.788 --> 35:06.223
She's the only one I trust.

35:06.257 --> 35:09.059
That's why you want her
to stay in business?

35:10.361 --> 35:13.296
Why didn't you just say
that in the first place?

35:13.331 --> 35:16.866
I didn't want you to know
how selfish I was.

35:18.436 --> 35:21.537
I never hold that
against anyone.

35:27.845 --> 35:29.712
Hello?

35:29.757 --> 35:31.147
<i>Today?</i>

35:38.256 --> 35:41.783
- Thank you.
- 10 minutes.

35:50.534 --> 35:52.501
Did you talk to Angela?

35:52.536 --> 35:54.403
She's aware of the situation.

35:54.438 --> 35:58.474
D'Alessios... They're being
backed by Rothstein and Luciano.

35:58.508 --> 36:00.776
From the horse's mouth.

36:00.811 --> 36:04.780
Luciano spilled it to me
before I was arrested.

36:07.117 --> 36:08.417
Can you bail me out?

36:08.451 --> 36:10.352
Five counts of murder...
There is no bail.

36:10.387 --> 36:12.855
- Would you get me a lawyer at least?
- For what?

36:12.889 --> 36:16.691
You know, to talk to,
plan a strategy.

36:16.726 --> 36:19.360
It's a waste of money.

36:19.395 --> 36:20.995
Then, uh...

36:24.400 --> 36:26.268
Call my dad.

36:26.302 --> 36:27.803
Can't he help?

36:27.837 --> 36:31.307
Your dad?
Are you that nervous?

36:33.377 --> 36:35.177
This kid, Billy Winslow...

36:35.212 --> 36:36.979
He's gonna testify, Nuck.

36:37.014 --> 36:39.549
- So I've heard.
- So I'm staying here?

36:39.583 --> 36:41.250
Is that what you're saying?

36:41.285 --> 36:43.119
You said you were going
to take care of this.

36:43.153 --> 36:45.855
I am. All I'm saying
is the legal system's

36:45.889 --> 36:48.257
not your ticket to freedom.

36:50.928 --> 36:53.196
Uh, yes, I'm still
on the line, operator.

36:53.230 --> 36:54.830
Thank you.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.199
Sir.

36:57.234 --> 37:00.102
Nelson, I was in a command meeting.
What's the hubbub?

37:00.137 --> 37:02.104
We've arrested
James Darmody, sir.

37:02.139 --> 37:04.707
What? When?

37:04.741 --> 37:07.043
Last night.
He returned from Chicago.

37:07.077 --> 37:11.047
<i>- Did he talk? - No, but he's
aware we have his accomplice.</i>

37:11.081 --> 37:13.983
- Either way, the road leads to Thompson.
- Wonderful, Nelson.

37:14.017 --> 37:16.385
Terrific. It's a real shot
in the arm for e bureau.

37:16.419 --> 37:18.554
Thank you for
your confidence, sir.

37:18.588 --> 37:20.822
<i>Keep up the good work.</i>

37:26.262 --> 37:31.066
- What did he say?
- He was pleased... very much so.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.869
Congratulations, sir.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.871
I didn't do it alone.

37:39.142 --> 37:41.277
I'm sorry about the telegram.

37:41.312 --> 37:43.647
That was very foolish of me.

37:43.681 --> 37:46.717
It was, but people
make mistakes.

37:50.154 --> 37:55.357
A man needs to have the
courage of his convictions.

37:57.526 --> 38:00.461
I knew we'd get
Darmody eventually.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.462
You were right.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.631
Hmm.

38:10.372 --> 38:13.073
This witness, Billy Winslow...

38:13.108 --> 38:15.209
You think it's safe
to keep him here?

38:16.845 --> 38:18.779
What'd you have in mind?

38:18.814 --> 38:21.682
Move him north pending trial?

38:21.716 --> 38:24.685
Federal jail
in Manhattan maybe?

38:26.555 --> 38:29.356
Keep him out
of Thompson's reach.

38:39.067 --> 38:42.836
Jesus Christ, will you
see a doctor already?

38:42.871 --> 38:44.605
Stubborn as a mule.

38:44.639 --> 38:46.640
Shut up and get him a drink.

38:46.675 --> 38:49.944
I'm fine, thank you.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.914
You look like shit.

38:52.949 --> 38:55.249
Well, your time comes,

38:55.284 --> 38:58.451
you just have to
accept your situation.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.586
Are we talking about you or me?

39:00.620 --> 39:04.056
This Fletcher
and these fucking democrats.

39:04.090 --> 39:06.960
And your sheriff
is out of commission now too?

39:08.696 --> 39:10.430
It's not so easy, is it?

39:10.464 --> 39:12.765
Nice that you can
still find joy.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.868
Five years in jail...
Can you blame me?

39:15.903 --> 39:17.670
One of us had to go.
You knew that.

39:17.704 --> 39:20.272
<i>- I had no choice.
- Neither did I.</i>

39:20.307 --> 39:21.766
Which is why we made a deal,

39:21.781 --> 39:23.745
so let's put it to bed
where it belongs.

39:26.913 --> 39:28.580
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

39:28.615 --> 39:31.684
Mayor Bacharach...
He's weak and losing ground.

39:35.121 --> 39:36.989
Even the fucking dog is sick.

39:41.828 --> 39:46.031
Well, what do you
have on Fletcher?

39:46.065 --> 39:47.700
<i>Nothing.
He's clean.</i>

39:47.746 --> 39:49.634
<i>What does he want?</i>

39:49.669 --> 39:51.135
He wants to be Mayor.

39:53.305 --> 39:55.139
Fucking boy scout.

39:57.542 --> 40:01.979
Well, replace him.

40:02.013 --> 40:03.881
What do you mean?

40:03.915 --> 40:06.750
Bacharach.
Run somebody else for Mayor.

40:06.785 --> 40:09.620
<i>People want change,
give it to them.</i>

40:09.654 --> 40:12.423
Or at least pretend
to give it to them.

40:12.457 --> 40:14.491
What do I do about Eli?

40:14.526 --> 40:18.595
Replace him too.

40:21.766 --> 40:24.868
You son of a bitch.

40:24.902 --> 40:27.204
I'm dying.

40:27.238 --> 40:29.372
There's no time
to be sentimental.

40:31.876 --> 40:34.377
I still can't decide.

40:34.412 --> 40:39.115
On you every dress
is a joy to behold.

40:39.149 --> 40:41.250
They're all so plain.

40:41.284 --> 40:46.221
I'll need something special
to wear to the inaugural...

40:49.092 --> 40:54.029
I think for now though just something to
wear around town. Warren is sworn in.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.969
Oh, I do so love this.

41:00.003 --> 41:02.604
Mademoiselle's taste
is excellent.

41:02.638 --> 41:07.575
- How much is it?
- $480.

41:07.610 --> 41:10.311
I'll try the yellow one on again.

41:26.062 --> 41:27.729
You have rescued me.

41:27.764 --> 41:30.698
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

41:32.934 --> 41:34.701
The first day you came here,

41:34.735 --> 41:36.803
To myself I say,

41:36.837 --> 41:39.405
"this is a lady
of taste and judgment."

41:44.276 --> 41:46.911
You told me I smelled.

41:46.945 --> 41:48.313
Pardon?

41:48.347 --> 41:51.617
- You said I needed to
bathe more often. - No.

41:51.618 --> 41:54.353
I was as useless
as the Polish girl..

41:54.387 --> 41:56.655
- Until now.
- No no.

41:56.690 --> 41:59.959
My English...
still sometimes I misspeak.

41:59.994 --> 42:02.796
I am grateful, Marguerite,

42:02.830 --> 42:05.265
very grateful.

42:13.674 --> 42:15.453
For your little one.

42:28.014 --> 42:30.456
Ivory...

42:30.490 --> 42:32.794
For her beautiful hair.

42:34.427 --> 42:37.996
My daughter didn't help you,
madame Jeunet.

42:38.030 --> 42:40.699
I did.

42:45.642 --> 42:48.748
<i>I just had to try it on.</i>

42:51.042 --> 42:54.178
It is beautiful, isn't it?

43:06.593 --> 43:10.529
Ah!
Smell that air, the salt?

43:11.631 --> 43:14.333
I'd like to live
by the ocean someday.

43:16.537 --> 43:18.905
I have a cousin, a rich kid...

43:18.940 --> 43:21.746
Ok, the rich kid took the grand
tour, sailed all over world,

43:21.747 --> 43:23.109
but he puked the entire way.

43:25.046 --> 43:28.182
Seasickness.

43:30.750 --> 43:32.085
I gotta piss.

43:32.119 --> 43:34.655
You need to go?

43:34.689 --> 43:36.891
I'll stretch my legs.

44:23.621 --> 44:24.893
Shouldn't have done that.

44:28.264 --> 44:30.707
- Done what?
- Tried to plunge for my weapon.

44:31.474 --> 44:33.008
What are you talking about?

44:33.043 --> 44:34.777
You plunged at me,

44:34.811 --> 44:36.078
tried to commandeer my gun

44:38.281 --> 44:40.116
That's why I killed you.

46:13.312 --> 46:17.482
I spoke to
my friend, the art dealer.

46:17.516 --> 46:20.385
He's not interested,
unfortunately.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.320
But you seemed so optimistic.

46:24.354 --> 46:26.654
Well, he's staying in Europe.

46:26.688 --> 46:28.790
Did he say why?

46:28.824 --> 46:30.992
His response was in a wire.

46:31.026 --> 46:32.763
Surely with your husband home

46:32.807 --> 46:34.496
your financial burden
has eased.

46:34.530 --> 46:37.065
- You'll have other chances.
- When?

46:37.100 --> 46:39.534
<i>I'll make some inquiries,
but honestly...</i>

46:40.970 --> 46:44.806
Your style is a rather cheap
imitation of Mary Cassatt's.

46:51.146 --> 46:54.615
I was in the
woods with my boyfriend Ernie.

46:54.650 --> 46:56.483
<i>He said to me,
"it's dark out here.</i>

46:56.518 --> 46:59.954
I wish had a lantern."
I said, "me too.

46:59.988 --> 47:04.091
You've been munching on the
grass for the past 10 minutes!"

47:05.226 --> 47:06.760
"Speaking of that," he said,

47:06.794 --> 47:10.030
"how come you never tell me
when you reach a climax?"

47:10.064 --> 47:12.398
"Well, Ernie," I said,

47:12.433 --> 47:15.602
"it's because you're never
around when it happens."

47:17.238 --> 47:19.806
There's nothing wrong
with being an opportunist.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.510
In fact, it's a trait I admire.
The steel pier, the boulevard project...

47:23.544 --> 47:25.879
You were Johnny-on-the-spot
with those.

47:25.914 --> 47:28.682
<i>A good Christian,
family man,</i>

47:28.717 --> 47:31.951
- well-liked in the community.
- Very impressive.

47:34.254 --> 47:37.622
- What are you looking for?
- The other shoe.

47:37.656 --> 47:40.691
Right now I'd like to sing
a little number for you

47:40.725 --> 47:43.126
called
"some of these days."

47:52.207 --> 47:54.766
Perhaps Mrs. Bader
would like a better view.

47:59.246 --> 48:02.382
Have I told you how beautiful
you look in that dress?

48:02.417 --> 48:04.792
It was a gift
from madame Jeunet.

48:08.288 --> 48:13.159
♪ Some of these days ♪

48:13.193 --> 48:16.462
♪ you'll miss me, honey ♪

48:16.497 --> 48:19.742
♪ some of these days ♪

48:19.772 --> 48:22.905
<i>♪ you're gonna be
so lonely ♪</i>

48:22.939 --> 48:26.142
♪ you'll miss my hugging ♪

48:26.176 --> 48:29.345
♪ you're gonna miss
my kissing ♪

48:29.379 --> 48:31.114
♪ you're gonna miss me, honey ♪

48:31.148 --> 48:34.584
♪ when I'm far away... ♪

48:34.618 --> 48:37.621
so I'm assuming
you didn't ask me here

48:37.655 --> 48:39.423
to sing my praises.

48:39.457 --> 48:41.658
Of course not, Edward.
I can't sing a note.

48:43.093 --> 48:45.728
How'd you like to be Mayor?

48:45.772 --> 48:47.930
With you as boss?

48:47.964 --> 48:50.565
I'd have more authority
as street-sweeper.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.774
But a lot more time to run
your construction business.

48:53.814 --> 48:55.270
It's time for a change, ed,

48:55.305 --> 48:56.872
and you're a solid republican.

48:56.906 --> 48:59.341
- What about Bacharach?
- Mayor Bacharach is ill.

48:59.375 --> 49:02.677
- He will not be seeking re-election.
