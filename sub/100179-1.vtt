01:07.023 --> 01:08.764
Emily, are you in here?

02:04.950 --> 02:07.344
Emily! Emily!

02:14.786 --> 02:16.223
Emily, are you in here?

03:43.179 --> 03:44.180
Daddy.

03:50.752 --> 03:51.753
No, Mommy!

04:13.035 --> 04:15.037
What have you done
with my daughter?

05:57.792 --> 05:58.967
Come on, sweetie.

06:20.728 --> 06:21.729
Come on, sweetie.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.471
Come on in
and see your new home.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.911
It's a lot bigger
than it looks in the pictures.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.478
This is where I grew up.

06:33.958 --> 06:34.959
What's that?

06:36.483 --> 06:39.964
Oh. That's a lift.
It's like an elevator.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.531
We had it put in for Grandma.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.403
It helped her
get up and down the stairs.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.665
Does it still work?

06:46.362 --> 06:47.711
No, I don't think so.

07:03.858 --> 07:04.989
Who's that?

07:08.340 --> 07:09.516
That's Grandma.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.870
- Is that you, Mommy?
- Yeah.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.353
That was right before
I met your dad.

07:20.614 --> 07:21.615
Come on.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.074
This is the room I had
when I was a little girl.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.467
I like it.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.129
Is Daddy gonna
come live with us?

07:58.173 --> 07:59.522
No, sweetie.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.307
But he's gonna come
visit you this weekend. Okay?

08:02.351 --> 08:03.352
Okay.

08:05.789 --> 08:10.315
Listen, I know this past year
has been really hard for you.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.708
But it's a new chapter

08:11.752 --> 08:13.592
and everything is going
to be better now. Okay?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.017
Okay.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.499
- You trust me?
- I trust you, Mom.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.065
Okay, good.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.768
All right, you stay here, okay?
I'll be back.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.291
Okay.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.937
Oh...

12:59.300 --> 13:01.389
Hey, Annie, how are you doing?

13:01.432 --> 13:02.999
Sheriff, why am I here?

13:03.043 --> 13:05.045
Because your daughter's missing.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.612
Yeah, so I should be back home
trying to find her.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.227
Why aren't you helping me?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.577
Because your ex-husband, Paul,
seems to think that

13:15.620 --> 13:18.101
you might have
tried to hurt or kill her.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.537
You must be out of your mind.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.542
I would never hurt my child.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.241
That's what
your ex-husband thought too,

13:27.284 --> 13:28.764
right up until you shot him.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.253
- Daddy!
- Hey.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.038
How's my little girl? Hmm?

13:43.561 --> 13:44.649
I missed you, Daddy.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.801
Oh, I missed you,
too, sweetie.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.088
Here. Look what I bought you.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.785
Thank you.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.179
Yeah, well, seeing as
you're a little farm girl now. Huh?

13:52.222 --> 13:54.050
I thought you were
coming this weekend?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.052
Yeah, well, uh...

13:56.096 --> 13:57.656
I wanted to see
how you were getting on.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.404
You know you can call?

14:00.448 --> 14:02.363
Yeah, all right.
Next time I will.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.582
Can I come in?

14:06.454 --> 14:07.890
Yeah, of course.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.854
Here you go, go on.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.206
Okay.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.598
Go play with your cow.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.087
It's been awhile
since I've been in here.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.220
Yeah.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.613
Your mother never really
was my greatest fan.

14:35.657 --> 14:36.745
Do you blame her?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.361
So, how's it feel, being home?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.059
Yeah, I think
it's going to be good.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.585
A little weird,
but it's a new start.

14:50.628 --> 14:53.501
Well, you know what people say
about moving home.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.894
I hope that's wrong for you.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.767
You, uh, get a job yet?

14:59.942 --> 15:01.291
I'm gonna start
looking this week

15:01.335 --> 15:02.727
when we are settled.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.851
You will get one soon enough.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.124
Oh!

15:10.822 --> 15:12.172
Are you gonna
stay with us?

15:12.215 --> 15:13.913
No, sweetie.
I have to go to work.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.437
But, uh, I'll be back
this weekend. Okay?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.960
- Okay.
- Until then,

15:18.004 --> 15:19.962
you take good care
of this cow for me, okay?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.398
Okay, I will.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.443
I love you.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.971
Look, uh...

15:29.015 --> 15:30.581
I'm sorry
you're back here again.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.974
No, you're not.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.410
It wasn't my fault.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.084
You were cheating on me
while my mother was dying.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.805
You were having
a nervous breakdown.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.285
Is that an excuse?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.418
Look...

15:42.854 --> 15:45.814
I don't want to
bring this up again. Okay?

15:45.857 --> 15:48.164
I'm better now,
and Emily and I are moving on.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.166
Okay.

15:51.689 --> 15:52.864
I'll see you later.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.054
When I was a little girl,

16:08.097 --> 16:10.143
we used to play
flashlight tag in these fields.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.191
You ready?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.367
Yep.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.848
- You're it!
- Hey! No fair.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.189
Gotcha!

16:56.841 --> 16:57.929
Man!

17:20.691 --> 17:22.476
Tag! You're it.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.511
You got me.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.862
All right, Emily,
turn your light off.

18:02.733 --> 18:03.734
Emily!

18:07.477 --> 18:08.957
Emily, turn it off!

18:20.055 --> 18:21.143
Emily?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.279
Oh, no.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.544
Emily!

18:32.850 --> 18:33.851
Emily!

18:38.291 --> 18:39.509
Emily, where are you?

18:55.743 --> 18:56.874
Oh, my God!

18:56.918 --> 18:59.138
Emily, stay right there.
I'm coming.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.663
Emily!

19:07.233 --> 19:09.844
So the doors were open
when you came down?

19:09.887 --> 19:10.888
Yeah.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.328
- Sure they were locked?
- Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty sure.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.286
Okay.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.594
- Is anything missing?
- No, n-nothing's missing.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.293
Everything looks secure to me.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.208
What about the doors?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.775
The kitchen doors,
were they locked?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.211
They were locked, too.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.865
Okay.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.215
Did your daughter
remember anything?

19:33.650 --> 19:34.651
No.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.611
Okay, well...

19:38.699 --> 19:40.657
I don't know what else to say.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.746
What about the lights
in the field?

19:42.790 --> 19:44.139
It's probably just some kids.

19:45.619 --> 19:49.231
- So you just moved in?
- Yeah, a couple of days ago.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.670
- And what's your name?
- Her name is Emily.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.066
You know, I have
a little girl named Maggie.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.155
Look.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.897
My daughter ended up on the roof
of the house last night.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.030
And those were not kids
in the field.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.524
Do you remember how you got
on the roof last night, sweetie?

20:16.737 --> 20:18.347
It was nice to meet you, Emily.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.175
Go on, sweetie.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.872
Listen, you don't have to worry.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.918
Call me if you
remember anything.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.136
We're here to help.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.751
Thanks, Sheriff.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.704
What are you doing, Mommy?

21:12.183 --> 21:14.664
I'm looking to see if there is
anything in the field.

21:14.708 --> 21:15.709
Why?

21:17.798 --> 21:20.017
Because I saw lights again
last night.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.197
And there's scratching
inside the house.

21:27.808 --> 21:28.809
Anything there?

21:34.728 --> 21:35.772
No.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.081
Come on.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.779
- Let's go back inside.
- Okay.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.477
Come on.

22:25.692 --> 22:28.521
I'm not talking
about lizard people

22:28.564 --> 22:30.000
or an alien invasion.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.654
I'm talking about an indigenous

22:31.698 --> 22:36.180
human-like race
living invisibly among us.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.967
What we're looking at here is some kind of lizard competitor

22:40.010 --> 22:43.623
that we drove into hiding,
and you are not alone.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.147
Contact me and tell me
what you've seen.

22:47.278 --> 22:48.758
Let me help.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.630
If you've seen
something like this,

22:50.673 --> 22:54.460
if you've encountered
or just felt its presence,

22:54.503 --> 22:56.418
you are not insane.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.552
We drove them
to hiding a millennia ago,

22:59.595 --> 23:01.075
and it's evolved,

23:01.118 --> 23:03.773
evolved to not only
live secretly among us,

23:03.817 --> 23:06.820
but to prey directly upon us.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.692
Think about it. We live in a planet
where every other species

23:09.736 --> 23:12.913
has a hundred variations.
And yet we...

23:22.183 --> 23:23.402
What's happening, Mommy?

23:30.887 --> 23:33.455
- You stay here, okay?
- Okay.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.200
Emily, go up to your room
and lock the door.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.767
And don't open it
until I say so.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.073
- But, Mom...
- Do it!

25:12.598 --> 25:13.598
Hey!

25:17.951 --> 25:21.432
I'm gonna call the police
right now if you don't leave.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.265
Oh, no.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.420
Emily, open the door!

26:36.464 --> 26:38.205
Emily!

26:40.947 --> 26:42.122
What's wrong, Mommy?

26:46.256 --> 26:48.084
Was there anyone
in here with you?

26:48.781 --> 26:49.869
No, Mommy.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.524
Come here.

26:53.568 --> 26:57.006
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.846
- So it was right after midnight?
- Yeah.

27:13.327 --> 27:17.113
- Could you make out anyone?
- No, it was way too dark.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.289
So you're about here,
you turned...

27:19.333 --> 27:22.771
And I saw someone staring at me
from my bedroom window, yes.

27:22.815 --> 27:25.121
And then they made their way
towards Emily's room.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.209
Did Emily see it?

27:27.994 --> 27:28.995
No.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.913
Look, I'm not
making anything up, okay?

27:33.956 --> 27:35.175
I know what I saw.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.394
I believe you.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.179
Do you?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.843
Just so you know,
I'm here to help you.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.148
You keep saying that,

27:52.192 --> 27:54.716
but I don't feel safe
in my house right now.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.414
Don't worry.
We're gonna figure this out.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.894
Okay.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.729
Hey, Sheriff. How's it going?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.992
Good. And yourself?

28:10.036 --> 28:11.080
Good, yeah.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.995
Is, uh... Is there a problem?

28:15.041 --> 28:16.999
Maybe you should talk to Annie.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.132
I'll see ya.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.004
Okay. Thanks.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.879
Come on, Annie.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.247
Ever since
you moved into that house,

28:28.271 --> 28:29.509
you've been
trying to tell me that

28:29.533 --> 28:31.840
something's after you
and your daughter.

28:31.884 --> 28:35.714
You gonna take that back now,
or do you still believe it?

28:35.757 --> 28:38.064
I still believe
there is something after us.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.807
You know what I think?

28:41.850 --> 28:44.940
I think that "something"
doesn't exist.

28:45.854 --> 28:46.986
Never did.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.684
Emily lived in that house, too

28:49.728 --> 28:51.773
and she said
she'd never seen anything

28:51.817 --> 28:53.166
like what you described.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.821
I didn't do anything to her.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.826
- Don't look at me like that.
- Then tell me what's going on.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.787
There's scratching in the walls.

29:07.397 --> 29:08.747
It's probably just an animal.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.190
I mean,
you live in the country now.

29:11.706 --> 29:14.013
It's not an animal.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.537
It sounds like there is someone
in between the walls.

29:20.976 --> 29:24.545
I saw lights in the field
so I went to check on them.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.914
I turned around
and there was someone

29:25.938 --> 29:27.417
staring at me from my room.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.499
Are you having
another nervous breakdown?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.558
- Never mind.
- I'm serious.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.318
You are acting just like
your mother did before she...

29:39.342 --> 29:40.343
Hung herself?

29:41.954 --> 29:43.172
Yeah.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.131
Well, I'm nothing
like my mother.

29:48.221 --> 29:51.267
You know, it's hard to put your mom
in a state hospital.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.115
And then find out that
you may have been responsible

29:53.139 --> 29:54.314
for her death.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.188
Look, I...

29:59.232 --> 30:00.886
I didn't mean it like that.
All right?

30:02.626 --> 30:04.324
She may have
been right all along.

30:04.367 --> 30:07.196
I knew you moving back
into this house was a bad idea.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.896
Well, this is all I have.

30:21.776 --> 30:22.777
Mommy.

30:24.518 --> 30:25.867
Oh, my God.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.565
Sweetie, look at you.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.610
Paper towels.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.086
It's okay. We're going to
get this cleaned up. Okay?

30:33.135 --> 30:34.267
All right?

30:34.310 --> 30:36.095
Here we go. All right.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.400
It'll be all good.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.823
I'll be back tomorrow
to check up on you, all right?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.413
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.688
I'm going to the office.

31:04.732 --> 31:07.735
If something happens,
you call me. All right?

31:10.129 --> 31:11.130
I will.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.877
I don't think Emily should be
living with you anymore.

31:18.920 --> 31:23.098
- We're fine.
- You're not fine, Annie.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.883
What are you gonna do?

31:24.926 --> 31:27.015
Are you gonna
take her away from me?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.507
What's that, Mommy?

32:24.551 --> 32:25.900
It's a monitor.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.264
So I can
watch you sleep at night.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.340
Why was Daddy mad?

32:33.255 --> 32:35.301
Because Daddy doesn't
believe me sometimes.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.086
I believe you.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.305
Thank you, sweetie.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.308
Come on. Time for bed.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.405
Mommy, can I sleep with you?

33:36.449 --> 33:39.321
Of course you can, sweetie.
Come on.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.009
Emily!

35:01.969 --> 35:03.231
Emily!

35:07.627 --> 35:08.628
Emily!

35:18.420 --> 35:19.769
Emily!

35:32.913 --> 35:34.349
Hello.

35:34.393 --> 35:37.004
Hi. My name is Annie Knox
and my daughter is missing.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.443
This is the Sheriff Dickerson

35:41.487 --> 35:43.358
on the way out
to the Knox residence.

35:44.533 --> 35:45.534
Oh, shit!

35:48.929 --> 35:51.061
Oh, my God.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.542
Hey.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.240
Hey. Are you okay?

35:57.329 --> 35:58.808
What are you doing
out here, sweetie?

36:01.333 --> 36:02.986
I'll take you home.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.336
Come in here with me.

36:04.379 --> 36:05.946
Come in here with me.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.081
Okay, okay.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.173
Okay, Emily, let's get you home.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.872
Please don't take me home.

36:54.386 --> 36:55.778
Oh, sweetie.

36:57.519 --> 36:58.738
Oh, sweetie.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.917
Oh, my God! Look at your nose.
Are you okay?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.093
Can you tell me
how you got out the house?

37:06.136 --> 37:08.138
- No, Mommy.
- Oh, sweetie.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.445
She came out of the field
and I almost hit her.

37:12.186 --> 37:14.667
Well, thank you, Sheriff,
very much for bringing her back.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.016
Come on, sweetie.

37:16.059 --> 37:17.859
I am gonna have to ask you
a couple questions.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.587
Why is her nose all bloody?

37:21.630 --> 37:24.285
She had a bloody nose
earlier today.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.504
I think she is getting sick,

37:25.547 --> 37:27.227
but I'm taking her
to the doctors tomorrow.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.292
How did she
get out of the house?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.468
I don't know.
The doors were locked.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.471
Emily, do you remember?

37:41.041 --> 37:43.217
I'm gonna have to report this
to child services.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.621
I didn't do anything
to my daughter

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
if that's what
you're insinuating.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.179
Your daughter said
she didn't want to come home.

37:50.659 --> 37:52.095
Why would she say that?

37:53.793 --> 37:55.751
We just moved in.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.144
And I just got a divorce.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.800
There is a lot of change
and a lot for her to process.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.020
She will be fine.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.260
Now, can I
go back inside, please,

38:06.284 --> 38:07.589
and take care of my daughter?

38:08.982 --> 38:10.288
I'll talk to you later.

38:11.898 --> 38:15.510
Why did you buy two shotguns
and a .38 last week?

38:15.554 --> 38:19.384
- For home protection.
- Protection against what?

38:19.427 --> 38:20.950
Is it wrong to own guns?

38:22.865 --> 38:24.780
We found one shotgun.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.956
What happened to the other shotgun
and the .38?

38:27.435 --> 38:28.480
I don't know.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.702
What were you shooting at
inside your house?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.195
No, Mommy.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.248
Emily!

39:24.231 --> 39:26.059
Something took my daughter.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.844
It was not human.

39:30.542 --> 39:34.589
She is still in that house
and I'm going home to find her.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.592
No, sweetie.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.595
You ain't going nowhere.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.954
I'm transferring you
to Richmond. You leave tonight.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.009
Come on.

40:08.754 --> 40:11.060
You're wasting time.

40:11.104 --> 40:15.108
She's already gone.
Stop it with the lies.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.328
Everyone knows you did it.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.027
You must have buried her
somewhere special.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.421
They'll find your daughter
and when they do...

40:25.553 --> 40:27.990
Do you know what they do
to child murderers in Mississippi?

40:30.558 --> 40:32.821
The best thing you can do is
tell us where she's at.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.867
I told you what happened.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.304
I hope a creature doesn't
get you on the way there.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.590
Shit! I can't see anything.

41:11.686 --> 41:13.775
You're the one
who killed her kid.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.344
Hey, I'm talking to you.

41:17.387 --> 41:18.432
Shut the fuck up!

41:23.916 --> 41:25.308
Holy shit, look out!

41:37.451 --> 41:38.452
Aah!

43:33.306 --> 43:34.481
Shit.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.837
- So that's it?
- Yup.

43:44.665 --> 43:48.190
- When did it happen?
- Sometime in the night.

43:48.234 --> 43:51.367
They must've lost the road
in the storm.

43:51.411 --> 43:52.934
Came down the embankment.

43:54.022 --> 43:55.110
It happens.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.859
How many bodies
did you find?

44:04.903 --> 44:06.948
Two, in the van.

44:06.992 --> 44:09.081
Everyone else in back
got thrown out.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.039
Thrown out?

44:11.083 --> 44:12.562
Yeah. The back doors
are blown open.

44:16.305 --> 44:17.350
I don't know, Sheriff.

44:17.393 --> 44:18.699
There's a lot of ground
to cover,

44:18.743 --> 44:20.024
but I'm sure
the bodies will turn up

44:20.048 --> 44:21.659
somewhere down river.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.835
Well, let's get a move on.

44:25.097 --> 44:26.315
Yup.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.077
See, I told you
we'd find one downstream.

49:55.427 --> 49:56.602
Is that...

49:56.645 --> 49:58.560
Is that Annie Knox?

50:04.305 --> 50:06.481
Yeah, definitely ain't Knox.

50:07.308 --> 50:08.614
If she was dead,

50:08.657 --> 50:10.964
we probably should have
found her body by now.

50:11.008 --> 50:15.012
Well, she's drowned for sure.

50:15.055 --> 50:17.579
Yeah? You keep looking.

50:41.908 --> 50:43.518
Hey! Hey!

50:43.562 --> 50:44.911
Let's see your ear.

50:46.173 --> 50:47.653
Yeah.

50:47.696 --> 50:49.785
Good.
That's getting better, huh?

50:54.486 --> 50:55.835
There's no trespassing.

50:56.575 --> 50:58.011
I'm not trespassing.

51:02.146 --> 51:03.799
My name is Annie Knox.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.411
I know who you are, Ms. Knox.

51:09.936 --> 51:12.330
Are you gonna tell me
what is it you want?

51:12.373 --> 51:14.288
Something took my daughter...

51:15.768 --> 51:17.509
and I want you to help me
get her back.

51:19.032 --> 51:20.512
Well, then,
you better come inside.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.509
Please take a seat.

52:06.514 --> 52:08.255
I've been following your case.

52:09.387 --> 52:11.128
I must admit I'm fascinated.

52:12.259 --> 52:14.783
- How did you find me?
- The Internet.

52:16.959 --> 52:18.613
That is not good.

52:19.788 --> 52:21.703
They're gonna know
you are alive now.

52:21.747 --> 52:24.837
Which means they're gonna
follow you straight to me.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.318
You... You understand

52:27.361 --> 52:30.190
that they are watching us
all the time.

52:30.234 --> 52:31.496
I need your help.

52:34.890 --> 52:37.676
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.720
Really?

52:41.810 --> 52:46.685
I was sure they existed.

52:46.728 --> 52:51.907
No one would listen,
but you know it's out there.

52:51.951 --> 52:53.213
Tell me what you saw.

52:54.736 --> 52:56.869
I couldn't see much
because of the light.

52:58.871 --> 53:01.047
This blinding light
coming from its eye.

53:03.876 --> 53:06.835
No face just... Just light.

53:06.879 --> 53:08.272
It's Dark Light.

53:08.315 --> 53:11.710
This is a bad sketch,
but did it look like this?

53:11.753 --> 53:13.353
Look like this, look like this.

53:13.581 --> 53:14.582
Dark Light.

53:16.367 --> 53:17.977
Bad sketch.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.761
Did it look something like this?

53:22.677 --> 53:23.722
Like this?

53:25.114 --> 53:26.115
Ms. Knox?

54:07.026 --> 54:08.027
Hey.

54:13.293 --> 54:14.773
How long have you
had the nose bleeds?

54:15.817 --> 54:17.428
They just started.

54:17.471 --> 54:18.751
I don't think we have much time.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.478
Is this what took your daughter?

54:27.438 --> 54:29.004
Yes.

54:29.048 --> 54:31.833
It's a form of Humanoid
thought to be extinct.

54:32.660 --> 54:34.271
They mostly target children.

54:36.447 --> 54:39.188
- Why?
- Food.

54:50.374 --> 54:52.506
They consume energy.

54:52.550 --> 54:55.422
A child's energy is the purest
they can use.

54:55.466 --> 54:58.338
They harvest
their "inner light,"

54:58.382 --> 55:02.908
and they need that inner light
for their species to survive.

55:02.951 --> 55:07.782
Eight hundred thousand children
disappear every year.

55:07.826 --> 55:09.610
That's 2,000 a day.

55:10.655 --> 55:12.091
So how do we kill it...

55:13.266 --> 55:15.007
and get Emily back?

55:15.050 --> 55:16.051
I don't know.

55:17.749 --> 55:20.969
I need to see it for myself.

55:21.013 --> 55:23.755
Your daughter should be
somewhere near your house.

55:23.798 --> 55:25.409
There must be a...

55:25.452 --> 55:28.847
a way up to the surface there
that they're sneaking through.

55:29.587 --> 55:30.762
Come with me.

55:31.545 --> 55:32.851
Help me.

55:32.894 --> 55:34.505
If you really want to kill it...

55:36.158 --> 55:37.856
there's something
I need to show you first.

55:37.899 --> 55:38.900
Okay.

55:48.910 --> 55:50.259
Hey.

55:50.303 --> 55:53.132
- I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

55:54.176 --> 55:55.439
Sorry about your daughter.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.398
Hey! Let me out!

55:58.442 --> 56:00.226
How can I let you kill it?

56:00.269 --> 56:02.315
My whole life,
I have been searching for it,

56:02.359 --> 56:04.926
and now, I have actual proof
I can show the world

56:04.970 --> 56:06.145
and they will understand.

56:08.843 --> 56:09.844
Thank you.

56:11.150 --> 56:12.891
Walter!

56:16.938 --> 56:18.200
Come back!

56:19.114 --> 56:20.246
Walter!

56:21.029 --> 56:22.074
Walter!

56:50.319 --> 56:51.582
Oh, my God.

01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:17.282
Where?

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:24.985
Hey.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.684
What'd you find?

01:01:27.727 --> 01:01:29.686
Sheriff, you are not
gonna believe this.

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.732
Now, we've been together
a long time.

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:34.734
Yeah.

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:36.518
I've never seen nothin'
like this before.

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:38.912
It's just up ahead.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.713
Holy shit.

01:01:58.192 --> 01:01:59.759
When did you find him?

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.501
About 20 minutes ago.

01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:05.460
- Was it some kind of animal?
- No, I don't think so.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:07.288
Who is he?

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.770
His name is Walter Sims.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.990
He's a conspiracy theorist.

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:17.081
- Same guy from Knox's computer?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.996
Found his car smashed
in the woods over there.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:23.565
Seems like he was running
from something.

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:24.741
You got an address?

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.063
Fuck.

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:45.892
Hey.

01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:47.111
Hey, check that out.

01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:50.505
Oh, this is one paranoid dude.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:55.989
Sheriff, it's locked.

01:02:58.165 --> 01:02:59.166
Yeah.

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.140
It's locked.

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:26.454
Stupid.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:59.052
This guy is crazier
than my ex-wife, Sharon.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.360
Nobody's crazier than Sharon.

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:04.884
Well, hey, Sheriff?

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:06.712
You believe in Bigfoot?

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.891
You know, my cousin, Terry,

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:15.025
saw one of them Big Feets
down at the Lake of the Ozarks.

01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:18.202
Came right out of the woods,
ate up one of her chickens.

01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:19.885
- You know, there-there's a whole...
- Shh!

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:33.870
Check it out.

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:03.464
Jesus.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:39.283
Hey, Sheriff.
You better come check this out.

01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:41.198
Be right there.

01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:54.994
You are not gonna believe this.

01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:00.652
Who is it?

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.654
Just wait
till she takes off the hood.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.877
Is that Annie Knox?

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:11.141
Yeah. It sure
looks like her, Sheriff.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.158
Where was Walter's car
parked again?

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.170
Paul?

01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:09.586
Paul?

01:12:14.808 --> 01:12:16.201
Oh, fuck!

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:47.972
Paul, is that you?

01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:04.875
Put the gun down.

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.444
Don't do anything stupid, Annie.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.272
Sheriff, you don't understand.

01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:14.624
Put the gun down
or I will shoot you.

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:19.019
Drop it, Annie.

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:20.804
I'm not going to ask you again.

01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:31.902
Okay.

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:20.766
Oh, my God.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.986
What the fuck?

01:17:46.139 --> 01:17:47.184
Where are you?

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:01.633
Oh, my God.

01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:56.557
Paul.

01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:57.602
Paul.

01:18:58.124 --> 01:18:59.647
Paul!

01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:06.437
Are you okay? What happened?

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.788
I don't remember.

01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:12.878
I was in the elevator
and there was a bright light.

01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:16.882
Where are we?

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:18.144
We're under the house.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.711
Can you walk?

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:22.453
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:37.773
Is Emily down here?

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:40.253
Yeah.

01:19:42.647 --> 01:19:44.736
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.781
Come on.

01:19:57.749 --> 01:19:59.011
Careful, Paul.

01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:01.405
Let's go.

01:21:00.116 --> 01:21:01.378
What's it doing?

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:03.119
It's sucking the energy
from her.

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:15.871
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:21:18.351 --> 01:21:19.613
Tell Emily I love her.

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:48.338
Emily.

01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:50.122
Emily. Come on,
wake up, it's Mom.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.171
Shit.

01:21:55.214 --> 01:21:56.215
Emily.

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:57.695
Honey.

01:21:57.738 --> 01:21:59.001
Oh, my God.

01:22:05.572 --> 01:22:06.747
Oh, God.

01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:08.097
Emily!

01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:11.013
Emily, come on, wake up!

01:22:18.846 --> 01:22:19.935
Oh.

01:22:20.457 --> 01:22:21.458
Emily.

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:28.944
I knew you would
come for me, Mommy.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.815
Of course I'd come back for you.

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.512
Come on.

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:33.557
We gotta be quick.

01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.749
Here, honey.

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:52.968
Upstairs, okay?

01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:57.320
- Annie?
- Paul?

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:00.714
Daddy!

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.282
No!

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:06.938
No!

01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:14.075
Emily, run!

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:42.191
Come on.

01:23:46.108 --> 01:23:47.283
Go stand by the door.

01:23:57.728 --> 01:23:58.990
Go on, honey, it's time.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.035
Careful.

01:24:04.126 --> 01:24:05.126
Cover your eyes.

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:14.310
Emily, run!

01:24:14.353 --> 01:24:17.095
No, Mommy,
I'm not leaving without you!

01:24:43.295 --> 01:24:44.427
Emily, go!

01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:50.215
Go! Go! I promise I'm coming.

01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:08.712
Come here.

01:25:49.318 --> 01:25:50.928
Is it dead, Mommy?

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:54.061
Yeah, sweetie, it's dead.
