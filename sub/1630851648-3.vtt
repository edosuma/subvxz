DOOR OPENS

00:18.840 --> 00:21.400
DOOR OPENS
Leonard Finch?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.800
If you could follow me.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.720
Just Mr Finch.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.560
It's gonna be fine.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.120
A serious allegation has been made
that, on Friday 29 August

00:44.120 --> 00:46.960
at approximately 10:15pm,

00:46.960 --> 00:51.000
you were seen engaging in an act
of gross indecency with another man

00:51.000 --> 00:53.320
at the Merries Holiday Camp.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.000
Did you attend Merries dance hall
on the evening in question?

00:59.120 --> 01:00.880
You know that I...

01:02.440 --> 01:03.760
Yes.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.840
Did you leave the hall
around ten to ten,

01:07.840 --> 01:12.000
then go back to your own chalet?
I can't quite recall the time.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.240
Did you, in fact, meet a man,
then spend the night with him?

01:15.240 --> 01:17.920
I can't... quite recall...

01:17.920 --> 01:19.840
No.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.680
Well, yes.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I-I mean to say, I did meet
Mr Davenport. We shared a room.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.680
Twin beds. He came back later.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.080
This is you, correct?

01:49.680 --> 01:52.040
So, who's this fella?

01:52.040 --> 01:53.480
Oh, erm...

01:53.480 --> 01:56.880
I'm not really...
Really not sure.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.800
You seem very familiar with him.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.680
Are you a homosexual, Mr Finch?

02:06.800 --> 02:09.000
I have nothing more to say.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.600
You told me I'm not obliged
to say anything.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.960
What about Daniel Marlowe?
Photographer from your village.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.800
Allegation's it's him
you were in bed with.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.440
So he's bent an' all?
All right.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.560
I have nothing more to say.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.320
We're gonna have to do this
the hard way, then.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.000
Thank you, Leonard.
That's all for now.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.560
Leonard. I'm a fool.
You're no fool.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.000
One who thought for a minute
he was in paradise,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.160
when he was really
paving the road to hell.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.840
Daniel said, "Don't give them
anything," and that's what you did.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.560
I'm going for a cinnamon bun,
a hot cocoa

02:47.560 --> 02:49.720
and a stroll on Midsummer Common.
In that order.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.600
We've got an appointment.
No, I don't think so.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.920
Give my best to the Archdeacon,

02:52.920 --> 02:55.880
but his feelings on the matter
are very clear.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.120
And I've had all
the incandescent disappointment

02:58.120 --> 02:59.160
I can take from Mrs C.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.360
Good morning, Mr Lowell!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.920
Dahlias are looking lovely
this year.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.480
Oh, thank you.
Have you a minute to talk?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.160
Might I give you one of these?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.880
Hey!

03:28.880 --> 03:32.320
Damn you! So much for a fair
and democratic competition.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.960
Morning, Reeny. Well, you'd think
it was a race to the bottom,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.800
not to parish council.
It's hard.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.080
Derek's death seems to have
galvanised his critics.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.800
Your husband would be proud
to see you follow in his footsteps.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.320
APPLAUSE

03:45.320 --> 03:48.280
Well, it is getting lively,
for a village by-election.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.040
I find it rather encouraging
to see people throw their energy

03:51.040 --> 03:53.120
into local politics.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.720
And when the competition do it,
you know you've got them on the run!

03:59.520 --> 04:03.520
It's like I always say:
capital begets capital and...

04:04.920 --> 04:07.280
Reverend! Come and hear the word!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.600
And what word is that, Mr St Martin?
Maurice, please.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.120
The word is morality.
Your area of expertise, no?

04:15.120 --> 04:18.360
The way I see it, each generation
has its great struggle.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.560
And if the last one's was
a literal fight for their lives

04:21.560 --> 04:25.960
against a foreign evil, then ours
is with the evil in our own hearts,

04:25.960 --> 04:27.800
the everyday morality.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.960
I couldn't agree more.
And do you think, Vicar,

04:29.960 --> 04:33.600
that morality has its part to play
in local government?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.040
I think it has a part to play
in every aspect of our lives.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.400
Exactly. The council has a moral
duty to help local businesses!

04:40.400 --> 04:44.000
Shouldn't my cousin Phillip have
the right to build on his own land,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.800
without waiting months
for permission?

04:45.800 --> 04:49.720
Can't Mrs Bedwell be allowed to sell
Christmas trees from her shop?

04:49.720 --> 04:53.000
As a businessman, I know that
we thrive on entrepreneurship.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.200
And that is why the next council
must cut the red tape

04:55.200 --> 04:58.760
and let loose that great British
enterprising spirit!

04:58.760 --> 05:01.000
APPLAUSE

05:03.320 --> 05:06.760
That's it for now. Thank you all!
Reverend.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.240
I can understand if you have
reservations about me,

05:09.240 --> 05:10.960
our paths having rarely crossed.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.160
But I hope you can see
we're cut from the same cloth.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.280
I really must remain impartial.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.160
Of course!
But there is the more, er,

05:18.160 --> 05:22.480
delicate matter of our dear
departed chairman, Derek McArthur.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.000
You were there, I gather?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.840
When they fished him out
of the water.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.680
To commit suicide
does make you wonder if he wasn't...

05:39.680 --> 05:42.040
capable of committing other things.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.880
Could be the tip of the iceberg.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.360
Hmm, or idle gossip.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.760
Muck raking for publicity,
if I were being harsh.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.640
We need strong leadership, Vicar.
Every flock needs its shepherd.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.280
Come along, Maurice.
Busy schedule today, eh?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.520
Good to see you both talking.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.600
Hm.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.080
Where's Leonard?
Er, he's just in town.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.560
They kept him in?
No, no, he had a prior engagement.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.080
A prior engagement?!

06:25.800 --> 06:27.280
THUD

06:29.160 --> 06:30.560
I see Reeny called.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.280
As if I have time to natter away
with every Tom, Dick and Harry

06:34.280 --> 06:35.480
that comes calling.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.200
I thought you and Jack
liked the McArthurs?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.960
Drumming up support
in her mourning clothes.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.680
It's wanton luridness!

06:42.680 --> 06:45.320
It's hardly the dance
of the Seven Veils.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.040
And anyone who can win
a lovely legs competition

06:48.040 --> 06:49.360
is in no position to judge.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.120
Reeny's certainly
a progressive thinker.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.160
Taking a reformist stance.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.480
Liberal views on tolerance.
And look where that gets you.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.200
You're angry because of Leonard.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.880
I'd put more stock
in that St Martin chap.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.080
Get us back to proper family values.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.760
I'm pretty sure
Maurice's moral compass

07:08.760 --> 07:10.560
points whichever way the wind blows.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.600
Oh, smarten yourself up
before the Archdeacon arrives!

07:16.960 --> 07:18.000
THUD

07:18.000 --> 07:21.120
LARRY: Not your first time
in here, then, Mr Marlowe.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.960
No.
Questioned about a dead teenager.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.400
Nudey photos and a poisoning.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.680
And?

07:28.720 --> 07:33.120
On the evening in question,
did you join Mr Finch in his chalet?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.760
No.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.200
Did you engage in gross indecency
with Mr Finch?

07:39.200 --> 07:41.000
No. That's absurd.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.600
Where were you that evening
at quarter past ten?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.960
I went out to the main hall
from about seven,

07:46.960 --> 07:48.640
danced with the Inspector's wife,

07:48.640 --> 07:51.600
and I was back in my own chalet
by ten.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.160
I slept through to dawn.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.760
Have you ever seen Mr Finch
with another man? No.

07:59.760 --> 08:03.760
But I'm only an acquaintance.
Who went on holiday with him.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.000
I went on holiday with my friend
Reverend Davenport.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.480
And the Chapmans, who I've known
since I photographed their wedding.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.240
Well, we'll be in touch
if we have any more questions.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.520
KNOCK ON DOOR
Mm-hm?

08:26.520 --> 08:28.280
You forgot your lunch, love.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.120
You left in a bit of a hurry.
Thank you.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.400
You had a right face on
this morning.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.360
In fact, you still have.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.720
Leonard's gonna be OK, isn't he?

08:47.720 --> 08:51.200
Well, Larry's got the bit
between his teeth on this one.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.640
Thinks I'm a soft touch.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.080
Of all the things
the police could be doing.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.360
It's barely a crime!
Except it is, Cathy.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.760
And I have sent men down for it.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.040
We all knew of Mr Finch's...

09:10.040 --> 09:11.640
peculiarities.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.040
But there's knowing what he is...

09:16.520 --> 09:18.400
..and allowing him to act upon it.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.360
I had hoped that you would
have guided him away

09:23.360 --> 09:25.160
from such temptations.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.720
Don't we have a duty to save people
from living a lie?

09:39.920 --> 09:43.960
This situation has gone too far.
And too public.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.200
If these allegations
are proved to be true,

09:49.200 --> 09:51.840
then the church cannot defend him.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.960
Whose business is it...? What
do you hope to achieve, William?

09:56.960 --> 10:01.040
You really want to bang this drum,
wearing that collar,

10:01.040 --> 10:03.720
and publicly challenge
the law of the land?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.960
I understand if you cannot speak up.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.000
But I am...
You have a role to play here,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.280
in Grantchester.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.280
If you wish to remain
part of this ministry,

10:17.280 --> 10:19.840
you will cooperate with the police.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.200
Tell them the truth.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.400
The church is not above the law.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.400
How did it go with the Archdeacon?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.440
Ahh... fine.
Really?

10:42.440 --> 10:45.560
He's, er... he's concerned.
Am I out?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.720
I'm out, aren't I?
No!

10:47.720 --> 10:50.440
No, this is all gonna blow over
and then everything will be fine.

10:50.440 --> 10:55.080
Was he angry at my absence?
Leonard, it's gonna be OK.

10:55.080 --> 10:59.040
Will, could I have a word, please?

11:06.520 --> 11:11.680
This arrived for Derek today.
It's from a property firm in Hove.

11:11.680 --> 11:15.160
Confirming acceptance on Derek's
purchase of some holiday home.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.800
Well, I don't follow.
Why would he secretly organise this

11:19.800 --> 11:22.760
if he knew he was going to...
end his own life?

11:22.760 --> 11:26.320
People in his situation
often do contradictory things.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.800
I understand that.
But that's not Derek.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.520
I never really believed him capable
of what he did.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.000
I had to accept it, but... now this.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.040
This wasn't suicide, Will.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.120
It was murder.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.560
It's an open and shut case:

11:47.560 --> 11:50.760
Derek McArthur drowned himself here
a few weeks back.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.440
He left that note on the bank,
inside his jacket pocket.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.600
Happily married,
chairman of the council,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.800
well respected in the village.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.480
It just doesn't add up.
Or maybe it does.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.080
Sometimes, it's just a man
who ran out of rope.

12:05.080 --> 12:09.720
And another man trying to distract
himself from his curate's crimes.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.960
Maybe. Why didn't you come to me
about Leonard?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.920
I thought I had it under control.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.320
Well, you didn't.
And what would you have done?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.920
Intimidated Bryan?
Blackmail is an offence, Will.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.120
We could've had this Bryan fella in
for that.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.560
Instead, I'm having to grill
bloody Leonard!

12:25.560 --> 12:27.520
Whose explanation is wafer thin,

12:27.520 --> 12:29.800
and one wrong word
from another witness...

12:31.000 --> 12:35.760
A charge will mean a trial.
Where all this is laid bare.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.000
Why does the law care
what he does in private?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.880
He was happy and in love.
We have to fight for that.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.520
You're not that bloody naive.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.840
The only fight left is for you
to come in and say you knew nothing.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.720
Or better yet... give him an alibi.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.400
Oh, right. Yeah, lie under oath

12:53.400 --> 12:55.600
to hide Leonard from a stupid,
outdated law.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.000
I can't do that, Geordie. It goes
against everything I believe in.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.040
You tell the truth,
and he's done for.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.800
As I said to your officers before,
it's Derek's handwriting,

13:12.800 --> 13:14.680
without a doubt.
Mm-hm.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.480
Was he always so pithy?

13:17.480 --> 13:20.280
Not judging by some of the annual
parish meetings.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.360
It was one of the oddities
about his death.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.720
He wrote tirelessly to constituents
and on council matters

13:26.720 --> 13:30.720
ever since his war days.
Is that where you met? In the war?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.840
Have you heard of
Operation Mincemeat?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.800
We managed to fool the Germans
into thinking

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
we were going to invade the Balkans
using just a dead tramp,

13:37.800 --> 13:40.080
an officer's uniform
and some faked papers.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.960
Did he have any enemies?
Derek had an ability to be liked.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.080
Even when he wasn't always
easy to live with.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.760
Sorry, didn't realise
you had company.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.240
Oh, Robert, come in.
Robert Waterhouse is an old friend.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.760
Will's kindly asked Inspector
Keating to look into Derek's death.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.880
Ah, you knew Derek well?

13:59.880 --> 14:03.160
In our youth... and these last
few weeks after coming to visit.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.960
Erm, I was basing a character
on him.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.920
I'm an author.
It was for my next novel.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.920
All feels very inappropriate now.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.120
I've been able to lean on him
for help with the election.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.680
Well, hardly.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.440
I hand out leaflets,
she's the one being righteous

14:18.440 --> 14:20.520
and brilliant
and changing the world.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.520
D'you think Derek was capable
of taking his own life?

14:25.520 --> 14:28.640
Inspector, I imagine you and I
both spend a lot of time

14:28.640 --> 14:31.960
trying to get into other people's
heads. Lining up the plots.

14:31.960 --> 14:35.240
But truthfully,
I don't think anyone really knows

14:35.240 --> 14:37.400
what goes on
inside another man's mind.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.400
You said he wrote tirelessly
to his constituents.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.800
Could we see any of the letters?

14:45.600 --> 14:48.560
I mean who files carbon copies
of their correspondence?

14:48.560 --> 14:50.120
Who files their correspondence?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.840
Well, haven't found any evidence
of a falling out,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.480
but if I read one more complaint

14:54.480 --> 14:56.520
about traffic measures
in the high street...

14:57.840 --> 14:59.800
So, there's a chain of letters here

14:59.800 --> 15:02.600
relating to a drainage issue
in a property down by the Cam.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.000
A Mr Eric Pritchard
getting rather tetchy.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.040
I'll raise you an Elsie Bedwell,
moaning about the bleating sheep.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.680
In this last letter, Derek
shuts down Pritchard's complaint

15:12.680 --> 15:15.960
by saying, "I'm sorry.
There's nothing more to be done."

15:15.960 --> 15:18.040
It's the same words
from the suicide note.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.800
Handwriting's a match as well.
It's the exact same letter.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.000
It's not a suicide note.
It never was.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.640
Derek sends this
to Eric Pritchard...

15:29.640 --> 15:32.240
Who cuts out this
particular phrase,

15:32.240 --> 15:35.880
slips it into Derek's pocket...
And pushes him in the water.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.040
I thought this place was empty.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.720
Mrs C said the owner moved on
years ago.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.840
KNOCKS ON DOOR

15:51.520 --> 15:53.200
Mr Pritchard?

15:58.520 --> 16:00.480
No big pile of post.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.960
Someone had to be coming here
to collect Derek's letters.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.200
The someone who started
a correspondence with him,

16:05.200 --> 16:07.480
to elicit a letter that sounded
like a suicide note.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.240
All sounds a bit elaborate.
It's murder, Geordie.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.800
By someone who knew Derek.
Knew this place was empty.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.080
It's someone in the village.

16:46.040 --> 16:51.040
Do a few common factors
underpin all good fiction?

16:51.040 --> 16:55.760
A hero's quest,
a decisive crisis...

16:55.760 --> 16:57.600
a changed status quo?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.840
Well, I like to think
it's not the universal,

17:00.840 --> 17:04.080
but more the personal stories
that really chime the strongest.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.920
Hello, Will... Inspector.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.400
I'm guessing you're not here
for the book club.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.240
Er, we're just checking on
some parish business.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.400
Oh, of course.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.320
Oh, bloody hell,

17:22.320 --> 17:24.760
they'll have you
in the village stocks for this.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.920
All the minutes
from the last 12 months.

17:28.920 --> 17:32.360
If Derek caused any grievances
at the council, it'll be here.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.400
It's quite the cast of characters
you have here, Reverend.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.520
Well, I get the feeling

17:43.520 --> 17:46.280
we're all gonna be
in one of your books one day.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.080
Well, I promise I'll be kind.
Er, did I sense some, er,

17:50.080 --> 17:53.360
reluctance from Reeny
when I called earlier?

17:53.360 --> 17:56.960
I think she'd hoped
you'd look into it discretely.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.080
A policeman calls on a candidate
two days before a vote.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.840
Ah. I was, er... I was just trying
to do the right thing.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.120
Oh, and you did!
Inaction would be far worse.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.000
Here we go. Give us a minute,
would you, Mr Waterhouse?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.720
Planning applications this year.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.360
Denied three times.
All made by Phillip St Martin.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.720
Maurice St Martin's cousin.
Lot of money lost out on.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.800
It's like you said:
it's someone who knew Derek

18:27.800 --> 18:29.720
and knows this village.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.880
So, what do you say, Phillip?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.640
Must have been frustrating

18:34.640 --> 18:37.040
that Derek was blocking
your planning applications.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.720
Extremely.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.080
It's no secret that Derek and I
never saw eye-to-eye.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.920
How so?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.240
I believe in investing
in local businesses

18:46.240 --> 18:49.560
and letting us get on with it.
Derek didn't.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.120
But if you're suggesting

18:51.120 --> 18:54.040
that his death was
in some way suspicious...

18:54.040 --> 18:55.960
I am.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.840
Look, Derek could be a pain,

18:58.840 --> 19:01.600
but councillors come and go
every few years.

19:01.600 --> 19:06.760
I'm a patient man. Truth is,
I found a much better revenge.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.280
And what's that?
Maurice.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.960
Running for office.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.120
Can you think of a more perfect
grenade to roll into the council?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.480
I was with my husband
in the main hall.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.680
We attended the dance
and stayed for a drink.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.920
Did you see Mr Finch
leave the dance hall?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.480
No, I did not.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.800
Oh, so you didn't see
if Mr Marlowe left with Mr Finch?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.240
No, I did not.
So, would it be fair to say that

19:39.240 --> 19:43.600
as far as you're aware, Mr Finch
went back to his chalet alone?

19:44.960 --> 19:47.960
"The integrity of the upright
guides them,

19:47.960 --> 19:51.360
"but the unfaithful are destroyed
by their duplicity."

19:51.360 --> 19:54.920
Have you ever seen Mr Finch
show affection for another man?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.160
Mrs Chapman?

20:04.480 --> 20:07.280
No.
What did you see, Mrs Chapman?

20:07.280 --> 20:10.160
You wouldn't want to pervert
the course of justice now.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.000
I don't think Mrs...
No. Or obstruct our investigation.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.360
No!
So, what did you see?

20:17.720 --> 20:20.400
Nothing. Nothing at all.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.960
TYPEWRITER KEYS TAP

20:32.680 --> 20:34.000
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR

20:35.360 --> 20:36.440
Leonard...

20:36.440 --> 20:40.280
Hang on!
Right... what do you think of this?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.680
"The views and attitudes
that shaped us

20:42.680 --> 20:44.560
"may not shape the next generation.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.000
"But perhaps nor will the prejudices
we wrestle with today.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.680
"We are a community,
and a community only works

20:50.680 --> 20:53.320
"when it carries everyone
along with it."

20:53.320 --> 20:56.280
It's very... political,
for a sermon.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.160
Well, I was thinking
of speaking at the hustings.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.600
Accentuate the positives
of a progressive candidate.

21:02.600 --> 21:07.080
You might find that church and state
are kept at a distance for a reason.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.600
Never underestimate public opinion.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.280
I've been thinking about
going back to the police.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.600
Present them
with a reasonable story,

21:16.600 --> 21:21.840
about Daniel and I being seen
innocently together.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.720
Lying is not the answer to this.

21:23.720 --> 21:28.760
But what is? I have the sword
of Damocles hanging over me.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.200
Come to the hustings!

21:32.200 --> 21:35.640
It'll take your mind off any
sharp objects floating above you.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.720
Hm?

21:37.720 --> 21:39.160
GLASS SHATTERS

21:43.320 --> 21:45.840
WATER SPLASHES
What happened?

21:51.280 --> 21:53.400
Look, I understand
that you're angry.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.560
I'm not angry.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.160
You wish things were back
the way they were. Before you knew.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.360
Pandora's box is open.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.120
Leonard is still Leonard.
His life is not a sin.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.840
And that's the view
of the Archdeacon, too, is it?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.880
When he said you're out as well
if you defend him? You listened in?

22:07.880 --> 22:09.840
Course I bloody did!

22:09.840 --> 22:12.920
He's part of your flock.
And you let him stray.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.640
I let him be himself.
Oh, and look where that's got us!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.320
You're the shepherd.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.280
And you stood by and let us all
wallow in his sins.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.920
Oh, don't be such a bigot!

22:26.080 --> 22:30.200
I will not be spoken to like that.
Mrs C!

22:30.200 --> 22:31.680
SIGHS

22:41.240 --> 22:43.560
Stupid boy!

22:56.240 --> 22:59.000
Oh, please tell me you've come
to make an exonerating statement.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.360
I can't do that, Geordie.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.840
Well, Mrs C was hardly
a star witness,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.880
and now you're gonna tell the truth,

23:05.880 --> 23:08.320
even if you damn Leonard
and lose your job.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.720
I don't know. I feel impotent.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.400
Have you tried oysters?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.520
What are you gonna do?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.320
Maurice St Martin,
let's bring him in.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.600
Some new evidence come to light?

23:22.600 --> 23:26.600
I've asked around. He's a hustler.
Underhanded tactics... er, bribery,

23:26.600 --> 23:30.760
sabotage, devaluing the land,
forcing the owners to undersell.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.320
So, basically, you want me
to haul someone in you don't like,

23:33.320 --> 23:34.640
based on some village gossip?

23:34.640 --> 23:37.480
Oh, fine, Geordie, it's clearly not
worth wasting your time pursuing.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.560
Easy!
That's not what I'm saying.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.400
In fact, I've already asked
Miss Scott...

23:42.400 --> 23:46.680
The St Martin files and the
McArthur files, from the archive.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.360
Thank you, Miss Scott.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.720
Forget God.
You want an all-seeing presence,

23:51.720 --> 23:53.760
she's in a wiggle dress
on desk seven.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.600
What is it? Five years back,
Reeny sustained some nasty injuries

24:01.600 --> 24:03.480
after an incident at her home.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.520
What happened?
There's nothing.

24:06.520 --> 24:11.520
There's no charges, but it reads
more like a fight than a fall.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.960
So, what... Derek beats her
and they shushed it up?

24:14.960 --> 24:18.680
Reeny mentioned he wasn't
always easy to live with.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.040
So, after years
of suffering in silence,

24:22.040 --> 24:24.480
the wife knocks off
her abusive husband?

24:24.480 --> 24:27.680
Believe me, that is
the most likely motive so far.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.840
I'll leave you to it.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.040
Reeny, er, we... we need to ask you
a few more questions about Derek.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.480
Did he have a temper?

24:47.480 --> 24:51.080
Ever struggle with
his anger boiling over?

24:52.600 --> 24:56.400
He could get worked up.
And was that ever aimed at you?

24:59.080 --> 25:03.240
What started as a happy marriage
didn't always stay that way.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.280
Whose does?

25:05.280 --> 25:07.880
But, erm, we did good work together.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.560
A few years back,
there was a domestic incident here.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.240
Police were called.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.040
It's not exactly "good work"
from the sounds of it.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.520
Yes. There were violent moments.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.560
And, yes...

25:24.480 --> 25:27.240
..I won't lie, the thought
of killing him did cross my mind.

25:28.720 --> 25:33.240
But he wasn't an evil man.
He was... haunted, perhaps.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.200
Tricking the Germans
might seem clever,

25:36.200 --> 25:41.400
but truthfully, war is
one awful choice after another.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.840
For Derek, it was picking the men
who never came back.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.400
You don't have to defend
a violent man.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.080
People should know
the truth about him.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.440
SHE SCOFFS
Really?

25:52.440 --> 25:55.520
I'm being judged because he died.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.520
Because of HOW he died.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.960
Because of everything
except who I am.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.920
I don't need to give the world
more of Derek.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.640
I wanted him to retire.
I didn't want to kill him.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.840
Do you really think
I would have come to you,

26:11.840 --> 26:14.280
questioning his suicide, if I had?

26:19.640 --> 26:22.880
Someone like Reeny as a chairwoman
might take up Leonard's fight.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.160
If it comes to that.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.640
You do not want it to come to that.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.600
At some point,
bad laws need to be overturned.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.640
People like Maurice
are holding this world back.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.760
People like Reeny... I wouldn't
pin all your hopes on her, Will.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.720
Well, I have to pin them somewhere.
No, you don't!

26:43.960 --> 26:47.040
What you have to do
is give Leonard an alibi.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.240
HE SIGHS
Geordie!

26:49.240 --> 26:51.280
Do you think I like asking?

26:52.840 --> 26:55.640
Jesus Christ, Will,
there's cracks in Leonard's story.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.760
Larry's been on the phone to the
Merries staff for more statements.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.440
If one person saw something else...
I can fix this.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.160
Just come to the station and tell us
Bryan Stanford was mistaken...

27:07.520 --> 27:12.360
..because Leonard was in that bloody
twin bed across from you.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.880
Hey!

27:14.960 --> 27:17.080
Then all this goes away.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.800
APPLAUSE

27:26.040 --> 27:28.000
And that is how I know

27:28.000 --> 27:32.080
that the growing number of passing
motor vehicles is a concern.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.720
And I know that the lack
of a telephone line

27:34.720 --> 27:36.960
in Spring Lane is a concern.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.320
I know these things

27:38.320 --> 27:42.040
because I live amongst you
and have done all my life.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.560
EMPHATICALLY: I know Grantchester,

27:45.560 --> 27:48.880
and I want to serve it
as best I can.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.560
Thank you.
APPLAUSE

28:02.080 --> 28:04.240
Thank you, Mrs McArthur.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.720
Mr St Martin, would you like
to respond? Oh, yes.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.920
Derek McArthur served as chairman
to the council for many years.

28:18.920 --> 28:23.720
Mrs McArthur by his side.
His suicide is tragic.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.080
But it does beg a question.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.680
What was he so sacred of?

28:30.720 --> 28:34.680
Was there something rotten
in Grantchester?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.320
Perhaps Mrs McArthur can help us,

28:37.320 --> 28:40.800
since she's been seen
talking to the police.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.120
Perhaps you would care to comment
on the accusation of gross indecency

28:45.120 --> 28:47.280
levelled at our very own
church curate?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.240
Hey!
Bloody hell.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.320
Reeny!

28:56.920 --> 28:59.400
SHOCKED: This is utter...

28:59.400 --> 29:02.560
I-I have no idea what allegations
you're talking about.

29:02.560 --> 29:07.920
Really? Only a policeman
calls on you yesterday and today,

29:07.920 --> 29:10.160
and the curate fella's been
down the station, too.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.840
I mean, it's plain deviancy
here on our own doorstep!

29:13.840 --> 29:16.320
PEOPLE MURMURING

29:16.320 --> 29:20.600
To think that the unnatural
can take up home amongst us.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.320
I ask, do you want a council
that's just a soft touch,

29:24.320 --> 29:27.120
or do you want one that takes
a stand against the corruption

29:27.120 --> 29:29.800
that threatens our traditional,
British way of life?!

29:29.800 --> 29:31.600
THAT'S ENOUGH!

29:31.600 --> 29:35.040
Bloody hell. You dare to throw
these accusations out here,

29:35.040 --> 29:38.800
for public trial? This isn't
a cheap game for scoring points.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.840
You're toying with
someone's else life!

29:40.840 --> 29:43.560
You're-you're pouring poison
in people's ears and for what?

29:43.560 --> 29:44.920
For a few bloody votes!

29:44.920 --> 29:46.960
And what exactly are you peddling,
Reverend?

29:46.960 --> 29:50.360
Milk and honey for poofs
and communists!

29:50.360 --> 29:52.200
COMMOTION
Order, please!

29:52.200 --> 29:54.640
Steady on!
This man should be disqualified!

29:54.640 --> 29:56.720
All right! All right!

29:58.120 --> 30:01.720
Everyone just needs to calm down...
and go home.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.480
Leonard!

30:13.640 --> 30:16.440
Leonard, I am... I am so, so sorry.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.920
What... what was said?
Well, you heard the crux of it.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.880
And, er, Maurice only had
the allegation.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.000
The village?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.880
Mixed.

30:26.880 --> 30:31.120
And, er,
I'm sorry I, er, spoke up.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.080
That speech you were writing?

30:35.080 --> 30:39.080
Er, a little more
off-the-cuff, in the end.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.160
That's...

30:41.160 --> 30:42.760
OK?

30:42.760 --> 30:45.840
Well, I, erm... hit a table.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.680
It all got a little bit rowdy.

30:51.280 --> 30:56.120
Ah.
Sounds very Jesus in the temple.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.200
People won't care.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.920
How can I stand in front of
our congregation again?

31:10.920 --> 31:15.120
Walk into a... a post office.
I ran!

31:15.120 --> 31:19.480
I ran out and I didn't...
defend myself.

31:19.480 --> 31:23.240
I did!
And Reeny will, I'm-I'm sure.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.360
And the Archdeacon will be happy
with that, will he?

31:32.200 --> 31:38.160
I would hate more than anything
for my mistakes to cost you this...

31:40.240 --> 31:41.840
..your vocation.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.640
Please, Will.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.880
I wouldn't be able to look myself
in the mirror

31:46.880 --> 31:48.400
if I didn't say something.

31:51.080 --> 31:55.960
You are a...
wonderful idiot sometimes.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.800
Hello?

32:14.360 --> 32:18.600
Oh, sorry. The door was open,
and nobody answered.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.800
No, I'm up, I am. Come in.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.160
I can come back?
No, it's fine, I was just, erm...

32:27.320 --> 32:30.400
I can't pretend
I'm not disappointed.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.280
In me?

32:32.280 --> 32:36.520
Uh... I was a little taken aback.
The whole village was.

32:36.520 --> 32:40.320
Allegations about Derek,
accusations of Leonard.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.520
Leonard is a good man.
We are so lucky to have him.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.600
Damn anyone who thinks differently.

32:45.600 --> 32:50.240
And what a world it would be
if everyone felt the same.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.200
But you can't rock the boat
if they push you out of it.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.880
Another surprise delivery.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.360
Well, will you look who it is?

33:14.360 --> 33:17.440
The only man who can turn
a parish election into a fist fight.

33:17.440 --> 33:21.720
Jesus would be proud.
Jesus never met Maurice St Martin.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.240
How did he know about Leonard?

33:23.240 --> 33:25.520
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.960
Reeny received this today.
Hm?

33:32.640 --> 33:34.400
And "this" is what?

33:37.400 --> 33:38.880
Some sort of surveillance?

33:38.880 --> 33:41.000
Someone's made timings
of the comings and goings

33:41.000 --> 33:42.360
from the St Martin warehouse.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.880
There's about two weeks' worth
there, starting two months ago.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.160
Who's it from?

33:50.160 --> 33:53.440
Well, there's a covering letter
from a private detective

33:53.440 --> 33:56.560
that Derek hired. But there's
no address or number given.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.480
This last entry says,
"Observation is suspended...

34:02.480 --> 34:04.320
"to avoid suspicion."

34:04.320 --> 34:06.560
Derek was spying on Maurice?

34:12.200 --> 34:14.040
No-one's in.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.520
Well, that private detective must
have been watching from somewhere.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.400
Here's your surveillance post.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.400
A clear view of them,
but hard for them to see you.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.840
No ash in the ashtray.
Only cigarette butts.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.240
So? Must be on the floor.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.040
Can't see any.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.880
This how you win over all your
potential voters, is it, Maurice?

35:26.120 --> 35:29.400
I see exactly what your game is.
This is a vendetta.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.120
A vendetta? He doesn't like it
that I'm a hair's breadth

35:32.120 --> 35:34.320
from the parish council,
so, last day of the campaign,

35:34.320 --> 35:37.080
he's fitting me up
for whatever happened to Derek.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.960
He's the one you should arrest,
for sheltering a homosexual.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.840
Who told you there were allegations
about Leonard Finch?

35:47.840 --> 35:50.120
I've got little birds everywhere.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.600
At a guess, some cop got
loose-lipped at the Lodge.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.720
So, why'd you make a run for it
at the shed?

35:58.720 --> 36:00.880
Because when I find people
nosing around my property

36:00.880 --> 36:03.360
with a pair of binoculars
and I've done nothing wrong,

36:03.360 --> 36:04.640
I figure it's a stitch-up.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.240
You know, you love
to play the victim, don't you?

36:08.240 --> 36:11.040
"Poor Maurice,
picked on by the leftie vicar."

36:11.040 --> 36:12.760
Must wind you up something rotten,

36:12.760 --> 36:15.720
people preferring the vision
I'm selling to yours.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.600
You're pretty close to your cousin
Phillip, aren't you?

36:19.600 --> 36:22.720
It's gotta be a pain his plans keep
getting squashed by the council.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.920
Rumour has it, you've a habit
of sabotaging land sales

36:25.920 --> 36:28.160
and then swooping in
to buy them up cheap.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.880
Derek McArthur got wise
to your intentions

36:30.880 --> 36:34.080
and sent a private detective
to keep watch.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.840
And when you found out,
you got angry...

36:38.760 --> 36:41.040
..followed Derek...

36:41.040 --> 36:42.880
and pushed him into the Cam.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.800
That's... That's what you've got?

36:47.800 --> 36:50.280
Oh, bloody hell.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.200
You're right about one thing.
I do know how to get a good deal.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.600
Which is why I'd been helping Derek
buy a house down in Hove.

36:57.600 --> 37:03.240
Now, why would I kill a man I was
about to make a commission off?

37:10.240 --> 37:13.880
Ah, there's something not right
about this surveillance operation.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.600
The ashtray's bothering me.
Come again?

37:16.600 --> 37:19.560
This private detective smoking away,
watching the St Martin's place,

37:19.560 --> 37:21.000
but...

37:22.160 --> 37:23.680
..there's no ash.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.840
Why?

37:27.120 --> 37:28.920
Well, I dunno,
maybe he knocked it over?

37:28.920 --> 37:32.760
So why not bin the lot?
Why just put the stubs back?

37:32.760 --> 37:36.880
Erm, to make it look like someone
had spent some time there?

37:36.880 --> 37:39.560
And why would someone want you
to believe that?

37:43.800 --> 37:45.840
We've got a few crumbs of evidence,
and...

37:45.840 --> 37:49.360
I want to believe they point
back to Maurice, but...

37:49.360 --> 37:52.680
the ash tray?
The anonymous private detective?

37:52.680 --> 37:54.000
The notebook?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.840
They're like the components
of an elaborate story.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.600
And who do we know
who likes to tell stories?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.080
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

38:10.720 --> 38:15.160
Will. Inspector.
Everything all right?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.040
We've just been on the phone
to your publisher,

38:19.040 --> 38:22.880
who was very keen to point out
the military accuracy in your books

38:22.880 --> 38:25.160
is because of your own experiences.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.280
Of course. Robert and I were both
in military intelligence.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.800
With Derek.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.120
What's this about?

38:33.120 --> 38:36.360
You once told me that we both
spend time lining up evidence,

38:36.360 --> 38:38.240
to... to make sense of a crime.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.720
How about we head down the station
and have a go now?

38:54.840 --> 38:58.160
You wrote to Derek
under the guise of "Eric Pritchard"

38:58.160 --> 39:01.400
to elicit a response
that looked like a suicide note.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.160
You then met him at the Cam
and you pushed him in.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.960
SCOFFS

39:05.960 --> 39:09.080
You should take up writing novels
yourself, Inspector.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.920
But then Reeny asked me
to look into it.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.720
Because Derek had made retirement
plans you had no idea about.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.160
But then she became a suspect
herself,

39:17.160 --> 39:19.640
and you had to move
the focus elsewhere.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.400
And who was I most set against?

39:22.400 --> 39:26.040
Cue a hastily-faked observation post
at the St Martin's place,

39:26.040 --> 39:28.960
to imply that Derek had hired
a private investigator.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.560
Now it looks like Maurice has
found out Derek was spying on him,

39:31.560 --> 39:33.400
which gives him a motive
for revenge.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.600
It's all very...
Operation Mincemeat.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.280
Well, it's fascinating. Really.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.960
But you're starting
from a false premise:

39:43.960 --> 39:47.840
what possible motive would I have
for wanting to kill an old friend?

39:55.800 --> 39:59.560
"They sat in that cafe, as people
came and went about their business.

39:59.560 --> 40:04.560
"Just a tablecloth apart, but he saw
now that a world lay between them.

40:04.560 --> 40:09.280
"A continent of things unsaid.
Regrets piled up like mountains."

40:10.480 --> 40:13.560
"She would know nothing of this
world and that terrible loss,

40:13.560 --> 40:16.640
"he knew, was of his own making."

40:16.640 --> 40:19.560
They say you write what you know...

40:21.040 --> 40:24.120
..and you've been in love
with Reeny McArthur for 20 years.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.360
"Righteous and brilliant...

40:32.360 --> 40:35.320
"and changing the world."

40:40.640 --> 40:44.080
She burned with life.

40:44.080 --> 40:48.440
I was so in awe... I could never
find the words to tell her.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.480
It's ironic, really.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.720
She married Derek
while I was posted away.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.800
I didn't come back.
Not for a long time.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.160
But when I did...

41:03.240 --> 41:05.400
..her fire had...

41:05.400 --> 41:06.680
dimmed.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.720
Oh, give over, Mr Waterhouse.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.400
You're not the first man to miss
the boat with a pretty girl.

41:13.400 --> 41:17.440
That bastard beat her!

41:17.440 --> 41:21.000
He got her and he broke her!

41:21.000 --> 41:23.240
But you would have made her happy?

41:23.240 --> 41:26.880
I worshipped her.
No-one could've made her happier.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.480
I couldn't stand by and do nothing.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.160
Real knight in shining armour.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.840
If I didn't intervene...

41:33.840 --> 41:36.120
You murdered her husband
in cold blood.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.360
How very gallant of you.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.800
I think he really did
just want to help.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.960
How dare he.

41:52.960 --> 41:56.080
How dare he make it his job
to "save me"!

41:57.040 --> 41:58.760
I'm so sorry.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.160
I've lost my husband
and now my best friend.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.800
In no time at all.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.560
Voting day, Iris.
Afternoon, Reeny.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.880
Come along, now.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.400
After you.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.320
Apologies, after you.
It's quite all right, I'm just, er,

42:30.320 --> 42:32.200
popping out for a minute.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.480
Good day?
Fine.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.320
Well, er, had better.

42:42.360 --> 42:46.680
I'm sorry I called you a...
I'm sorry for what I said.

42:54.560 --> 42:57.160
Lie to them.
What?

42:57.160 --> 43:00.840
Please.
I can't lose my boy.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.880
Hello, Will. I've come to give
my statement to Geordie.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.680
You, too? He's in with Mr Finch.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.520
Leonard's here?

43:33.040 --> 43:36.160
So... what is it you'd like to say?

43:37.840 --> 43:40.320
"To thine own self be true."

43:42.160 --> 43:44.160
Isn't that how it goes?

43:46.880 --> 43:50.000
The allegation made
by Bryan Stanford...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.520
it's true.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.320
He was not lying about seeing me...

43:56.640 --> 43:59.280
..in bed with another man.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.960
Leonard... Bloody hell.
Why are you telling us this now?

44:04.280 --> 44:06.680
Because it's the truth, Inspector.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.680
Was this other man Daniel Marlowe?
No. A stranger.

44:13.680 --> 44:18.280
I don't recall a name.
Just a holiday romance.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.800
Then I must charge you with
the crime of gross indecency...

44:32.160 --> 44:33.880
..committed
at the Merries Holiday Camp

44:33.880 --> 44:35.880
on 29 August this year.

44:35.880 --> 44:40.320
DC Peters will now escort you
through the charging process.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.000
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.360
But what you say
will be taken down in writing

44:45.360 --> 44:47.920
and may be given in evidence.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.920
For your own safety,
and in view of the late hour,

44:49.920 --> 44:51.680
you'll stay here overnight

44:51.680 --> 44:54.480
and be taken to the magistrates
in the morning.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.120
SHE SOBS

45:21.880 --> 45:23.880
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

45:23.880 --> 45:25.800
KEYS RATTLE,
DOOR LOCKS

45:33.280 --> 45:35.320
