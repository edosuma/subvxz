WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:10.178
Said lightly season
those home fries, Edmonds.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.446
Last batch tasted like you used
the entire spice rack.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.682
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
How we doing?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.184
Just finishing up
these last tickets now.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.286
Order up.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.088
Eggs for Opps and Suppo.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.289
Where's the C.O.'s
omelet order?

00:21.322 --> 00:23.257
Should be sent up to
his stateroom by now.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.625
I'll have that ready for him
in five minutes, sir.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.428
Where's Petty
Officer Jones?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.397
Something I can
help you with, sir?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.532
Haring, where is he?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.267
I haven't seen him yet, sir.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.235
Kid probably overslept.
I'll take care of it.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.569
No, I'll take care of him.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.738
You handle the
C.O.'s breakfast.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.773
HARING:
Yes, sir.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.643
Jones! You think morning shift
is optional?

00:42.676 --> 00:45.379
Guess again.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.215
I'm not your mommy and
I don't do wake-up calls.

00:47.248 --> 00:51.452
Get your ass out of bed
and report to the galley.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.087
(sighs) What the hell
is wrong with you, Jones?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.322
You itching to get written up?

00:54.355 --> 00:55.256
Oh.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.265
*

01:34.562 --> 01:37.265
McGEE: All right.
How about this one?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.532
Is that different
from the last one?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.668
Yeah, this one is onyx,
last one was midnight.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.403
So, what do you think?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.404
It's nice.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.672
That's it? Nice?

01:44.705 --> 01:45.773
Honey, it's your tux.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.375
I'll love whatever you choose,

01:47.408 --> 01:49.443
but you need to make a decision.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.878
The wedding's
in less than two months.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.346
Yeah, I know, it's just...

01:52.380 --> 01:55.316
Oh, hon, got to go.
Caterer's calling.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.585
Talk later.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.553
Ah, well, I guess that's
that. Hey, decision made.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.422
QUINN:
Oh, no.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.191
What's with the long face?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.792
Delilah. She hated it.
She hated the tux.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.460
Hmm-mm... what?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.296
No, no, no.
No, she didn't.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.430
That was her fake smile.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.531
No, you're crazy.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.865
Seriously, McGee,
this is classic.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.701
You mean boring.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.336
TORRES:
Yeah, baby.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.707
Huh? That's what
I'm talking about.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.642
Please, no pictures.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.345
Nah, go for it.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.479
Woof.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.781
Was that out loud?

02:27.815 --> 02:28.982
Mm-hmm.
Mm.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.352
You know, that's the kind
of reaction that I want to get

02:31.385 --> 02:33.321
just once, just not,
you know, "You look nice."

02:33.354 --> 02:34.955
Then lose
the dated threads, man.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.424
It's not your prom,

02:36.457 --> 02:37.491
it's your wedding.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.692
Nobody wears
cummerbunds anymore.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.394
REEVES: How about
something like this?

02:40.428 --> 02:42.363
Modern tuxedo
for the modern man?

02:42.396 --> 02:44.798
Hot damn.
Wowza.
Oh, come on.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.900
Sorry, Nick. I didn't mean
to steal your thunder.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.270
Actually, I'm not sorry.

02:49.303 --> 02:49.970
(Torres laughs)

02:50.003 --> 02:51.672
Anyways, you look like a waiter.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.507
Yeah? Well, you look
like Johnny Cash.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.875
Okay, I'll take that.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.477
All right, enough, boys.
McGEE:
It's a nightmare.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.579
Everyone at my wedding
is gonna look better than me.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.414
It could be worse, McGee.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.815
Could be flying over the
Atlantic with Gibbs right now.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.651
I don't know,
transporting a dead body

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
may be more fun
than this, actually.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.554
Come on, mate.
Look at you.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.555
You look dashing.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.556
Yeah? Really think so?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.490
Yes.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.591
Showstopper.
Mm-hmm.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.597
Did someone say showstopper?

03:17.631 --> 03:19.633
Wow.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.668
Mm.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.506
MAN (over radio):
Flight corridors,
flight corridors,

03:25.539 --> 03:26.674
ready on the helo deck.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.808
All hands stand clear.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.847
Yeah, as I was saying,
helicopters and I

03:33.881 --> 03:35.483
haven't always
exactly gotten along.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.917
You know, but
I've really grown

03:36.950 --> 03:38.352
to appreciate
their efficiency.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.554
We just travelled
around 300 miles

03:40.588 --> 03:41.989
in, uh, around 90 minutes.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.991
Felt a lot longer to me.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.327
MAN (over P.A. system):
...attention all hands,
secure from general quarters.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.729
(chuckles)

03:55.436 --> 03:58.539
Agent Gibbs. I'm the C.O.,
Commander Bitterman.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.508
This is Chief Choi,
our onboard corpsman.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.042
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.277
BITTERMAN:
Appreciate you flying out.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.445
Yeah, not a problem.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.446
This is Dr. Palmer,

04:05.479 --> 04:06.680
assistant medical examiner.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.681
Happy to be here.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.483
I'm not happy that your,

04:09.517 --> 04:10.518
um, sailor's dead, obviously.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.719
That's-that's terrible.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.053
I'm happy as in, uh,

04:13.086 --> 04:15.689
I am happy to help in any way

04:15.723 --> 04:17.458
that I can...

04:17.491 --> 04:18.559
medically speaking.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.760
Someone else
please say something.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.430
Uh, Chief,
would you take Dr. Palmer

04:22.463 --> 04:24.298
to Petty Officer
Jones' body?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.466
Yes, sir. This way.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.937
This is Jones'
service record.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.740
Yeah. When was
his body discovered?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.443
0645 yesterday morning
by his division officer,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.077
Ensign Stoddard.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.447
Master-at-arms sealed off
the area and took photos.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.714
Anything suspicious?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.716
Other than a seemingly
healthy 22-year-old

04:42.750 --> 04:44.618
suddenly dropping dead, no.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.421
I was hoping that
NCIS would help me

04:47.455 --> 04:48.489
shed some light
on this matter.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.057
How well did
you know Jones?

04:50.090 --> 04:52.526
He was assigned as my
food service assistant.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.328
We interacted
on a daily basis.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.597
He was a good kid, he was gonna
make something of himself.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.632
It's a damn shame.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.501
CHOI:
When I was called to the scene,

05:00.534 --> 05:03.471
I did an external exam and found
no outward signs of trauma.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.406
Any defensive wounds?
Negative.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.574
Did Petty Officer Jones

05:06.607 --> 05:08.442
have any preexisting
medical conditions?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.911
Low blood pressure,
which he was on medication for.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.013
His last physical
was two months ago,

05:13.046 --> 05:14.515
passed with flying colors.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.816
(stammers)
Where are we headed?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.751
I thought that the body
was found in crew berthing?

05:17.785 --> 05:20.020
He was, but per
Navy protocol,

05:20.053 --> 05:22.556
his body was moved to cold
storage for preservation.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.591
Cold storage?

05:23.624 --> 05:24.825
Our food-service freezer.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.059
(chuckles)
The health department

05:26.093 --> 05:27.495
would have a field day
with that.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.530
(chuckles) We emptied
the space out beforehand.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.931
Again, per Navy protocol.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.065
What the hell?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.702
Someone cut the padlock.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.475
Jones' body... it's gone.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.513
This will complicate
the autopsy.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.494
I jinxed us, didn't I?

06:00.528 --> 06:03.797
So much for a quiet day
at the office.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.634
So, you're telling me Petty
Officer Jones was murdered?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.969
You can't know that
without a body.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.940
Somebody took it
for a reason. Why?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.142
You and your team are free
to turn this place inside out,

06:15.175 --> 06:17.144
but this ship, my ship,

06:17.177 --> 06:19.647
is set to rendezvous with
the carrier group in two days.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.582
I can't alter course.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.951
Commander, your ship's
an active crime scene.

06:23.984 --> 06:27.721
The only place it's going
is back to Norfolk.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.632
I can't tell you that.

06:38.666 --> 06:42.169
Delilah and I want our
first song to be a surprise.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.538
Are you sure that's a good idea?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
Yeah, I'm sure.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.675
Why? What are you thinking?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.009
TORRES:
Well, I don't know.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.778
I've been to many
weddings, man,

06:50.811 --> 06:53.714
and the first song the couple
dances to, it's critical.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.184
I mean, it sets the tone
for the entire marriage.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.553
All right, if I tell you,

06:59.587 --> 07:01.188
you got to promise not to tell
anyone else. You swear?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.590
My honor.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.558
Which one is it? Huh?

07:04.592 --> 07:05.759
"Crazy in Love"?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.228
"Heaven"?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.463
"La Bamba"?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.065
"She Blinded Me with Science."

07:13.801 --> 07:16.069
'Cause when we first met,
we bonded over science.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.906
McGee, no.
No, no, no, no.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.940
It was supposed to be cute.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.509
You know, you're so lucky

07:21.542 --> 07:22.710
my hands are freezing right now

07:22.743 --> 07:24.211
'cause I'll smack you.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.145
QUINN:
Oh, really?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.213
You're cold?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.481
Try being stuck in there.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.248
Did you find anything?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.250
Frostbite count?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.885
Nope.
Then I got nothing.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.753
Where's Bishop?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.488
She's talking
to Petty Officer Jones'

07:34.522 --> 07:36.089
division officer,
Ensign Stoddard.

07:36.123 --> 07:36.990
What do we know?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.592
The victim is Petty Officer

07:38.626 --> 07:40.260
Third Class Gregory Jones, 22.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.095
He's from Overbrook,
Pennsylvania.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.064
Worked on board as
a culinary specialist.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.266
His parents were
on vacation in New Zealand.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.502
They're catching
the next flight back to D.C.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.537
McGee:
Jones got a sister,

07:49.570 --> 07:52.105
Regina, freshman
at John Hamilton.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.941
She's also been notified
of her brother's death.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.010
And it didn't take a
criminal mastermind to break in.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.547
The padlock on the freezer's
just flimsy.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.816
How do you steal a body on board
of a ship full of people

08:02.850 --> 08:04.552
and nobody saw anything?

08:04.585 --> 08:05.853
Maybe someone did.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.588
Finish up in there
and go find out.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.990
You two, back to D.C.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.959
Talk to Jones' sister.
What does she know?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.731
STODDARD:
The top rack is Jones'.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.933
This is where you found him?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.602
Mm-hmm.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.704
I was yelling at him.

08:23.737 --> 08:27.040
Thought he had overslept
and was slacking off.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.746
Ensign Stoddard.

08:35.282 --> 08:40.320
Sorry. I just, I've never seen
a dead body before.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.222
Do you know
what happened to him?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.758
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.595
Uh, how long have you been
the food service officer?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.663
A little over a year.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.299
Jones is one of 20 culinary
specialists that I supervise.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.967
He get along well with everyone?

08:54.001 --> 08:57.638
Working food service
on a ship is a tough job

08:57.671 --> 09:00.007
and often a thankless one,
but Jones never complained.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.343
He kept to himself
and he worked hard.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.846
But if he had an issue,
he wouldn't have come to me.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.280
Why not?

09:07.314 --> 09:08.882
The enlisted sailors tend
to try and settle things

09:08.916 --> 09:10.684
amongst their fellow blue shirts

09:10.718 --> 09:12.953
before involving
a superior officer,

09:12.986 --> 09:16.757
sort of a unspoken code
of conduct.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796
All right. Thank you.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.231
That was the front gate.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.868
Petty Officer Jones' sister
is on her way in.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.670
Perfect timing.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.671
Delilah, hey.

09:30.704 --> 09:34.141
And there she is,
our beautiful, blushing bride.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.009
Please, everyone,
help me welcome

09:36.043 --> 09:39.346
the future Delilah
Fielding McGee.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.815
Nick, you are not emceeing
our wedding reception.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.351
All I'm saying is I can
get the party started.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.387
So, what are you doing here?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
I am dropping off
our revised guest list.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.891
You're in charge of invitations

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
and these need
to go out this week.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.695
Wait, 308 guests?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.029
I thought we agreed
on a small wedding.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.331
Oh, we did. Our mothers
are a different story.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.033
With both our families
and our friends

10:00.067 --> 10:01.702
and everyone's plus-ones,

10:01.735 --> 10:02.870
this is where we are.

10:02.903 --> 10:03.737
That's a rookie move.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.039
You don't bring a date
to a wedding.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.074
Come on, man.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.208
You're stuck with them
all night.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.710
So I can mark you
down as solo then?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.778
Absolutely.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.013
But you can trust me,

10:13.046 --> 10:15.749
I will be leaving as a plus-one.

10:19.319 --> 10:24.191
(clears throat) I'm gonna
give you two lovebirds...

10:24.224 --> 10:26.226
some space.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.062
(sighs)

10:29.096 --> 10:30.397
Tim, there's still
so much to do.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.398
I'm-I'm starting to go
into panic mode.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.900
Don't worry about it, okay?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.134
I'm gonna handle
these invitations.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.435
Oh, it's not just
the invitations.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.804
We split our to-do list
50-50, Tim,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.939
and you've been
slacking big time.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.074
What are you talkin...
No, I haven't.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.310
Um, well, according
to the wedding planner app,

10:43.343 --> 10:46.046
you are only,
let me see here,

10:46.079 --> 10:49.082
Uh, ooh, 22% complete.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.450
Numbers don't lie.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.752
Look, I am so
sorry, all right?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.053
Work has been
all-encompassing.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.688
I've had no free time at all.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.890
Oh, and you think that
my 80 hours a week

10:56.924 --> 10:59.459
at the DOD is for funsies?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.895
Honey, I need you
to step up.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.998
Please. This has to be
a team effort.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.867
I will step up, I promise.
Promise?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.236
Yes.
(sighs)
Thank you.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.739
See you for dinner?
Count on it.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.344
Ms. Fielding.
Director.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.847
Director Vance.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.749
You know,
pre-wedding tension.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.085
As someone who
was also married

11:25.118 --> 11:26.820
to a strong,
intelligent woman,

11:26.854 --> 11:29.156
may I give you some
advice, Agent McGee?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.824
Don't blow it?
No.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.425
Never take it for granted.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.361
Not for one second.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.731
And don't blow it.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.466
Mmm.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.368
(sighs, phone rings)

11:43.303 --> 11:44.772
Special Agent McGee.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.008
Yeah, I'll be right there.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.345
It feels like it's
some sort of bad dream.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.247
Like any minute
I'll wake up,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.984
and everything's gonna be
like it was.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.353
Regina, we don't have
to do this now.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.823
We can wait until
your parents get here.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.792
No, their flight doesn't
get in for hours.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.793
I don't want
to wait anymore.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.895
I want to see my brother.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.764
You can't.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.533
Not yet.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.835
Why not?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.103
I thought you needed me

12:16.136 --> 12:17.370
to identify his body.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.841
We did,

12:20.874 --> 12:22.742
but some things
have changed.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.780
Regina, your, um...

12:26.814 --> 12:28.381
your brother's body is missing.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.984
Missing?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.519
How?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.487
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.824
I can't believe
this is happening.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.791
When was the last time
you talked to him?

12:37.825 --> 12:40.160
Um...

12:40.193 --> 12:43.163
Greg e-mailed me
two days ago.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.332
I was too busy
studying for finals.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.499
I didn't write him back.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.201
He sounded really stressed out.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.536
I should have
made time for him.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.171
Stressed out about what?

12:51.204 --> 12:55.175
He was having issues
with his supervisor.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.145
Said he was being
unfairly singled out.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.480
Picked on.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.149
But he never told me
specifics.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.316
Which supervisor?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.418
Ensign Stoddard?
No.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.487
A petty officer.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.958
I think Greg said
his name was Haring.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.261
HARING: You're both out
of your damn minds.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.096
I got work to do, I don't
have time for this.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.065
BISHOP: Well, time won't be
something you'll really

13:18.098 --> 13:20.233
have to worry about
at Leavenworth.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.102
Does that appeal to you?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.603
No.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.973
GIBBS:
Then take a seat.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.113
You seem a little
defensive, Haring.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.948
Because you think I had
something to do
with Jonesy's death.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.083
Prove us wrong.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.184
Why were you
hazing Jones?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.618
Hazing?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.120
It wasn't anything
like that.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.089
It was all in good fun.
We were just ragging on him.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.191
It's what sailors do
to each other.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.927
We?
The galley crew.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.595
Jonesy was trying
to transfer

13:48.628 --> 13:50.197
out of the food
service division.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.899
As payback for ditching us,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.300
we had him do extra duty.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.502
Scullery, grease traps,
that kind of thing.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.637
That's it?
I told you,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.239
we were just
messing around.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.041
We weren't actually
angry with the kid.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.610
He was our friend.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.112
(sighs)

14:05.145 --> 14:07.547
Well, we checked every
compartment onboard,

14:07.580 --> 14:09.016
no signs of Jones' body.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.617
Crew?
No one saw anything,

14:10.650 --> 14:11.952
no one heard anything.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.053
Someone's lying.
(phone rings)

14:13.086 --> 14:14.922
McGee, where are you?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.924
Portsmouth Pier,
with the Coast Guard.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.226
One of their patrol boats just
pulled a body out of the water.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.393
Jones?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.529
I'm afraid so.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.231
Looks like his body bag
was wrapped inside

14:24.264 --> 14:26.133
an industrial trash bag,

14:26.166 --> 14:27.901
and an attempt was made
to weigh it down.

14:27.935 --> 14:31.104
Something about Jones' body

14:31.138 --> 14:33.006
that someone doesn't
want found.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.188
Petty Officer Jones'
cause of death was

14:48.221 --> 14:50.057
a myocardial infarction.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.291
Too young for a heart
attack, Ducky.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.227
Indeed. But while there
are some rare cases,

14:54.261 --> 14:57.230
this young man's death
was not a natural one.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.099
And according
to Abby's blood panel,

14:59.132 --> 15:01.935
fludrocortisone was
found in Jones' system.

15:01.969 --> 15:05.372
DUCKY: It's a medication used
to treat low blood pressure.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.507
It's noted in his
medical file.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.676
That would kill him?
Yes and no.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.579
He also tested positive for
methylenedioxymethamphetamine,

15:12.612 --> 15:16.349
more commonly referred to
as MDMA.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.385
Uh, "molly."

15:18.418 --> 15:21.488
Ecstasy?
Disco biscuits,

15:21.521 --> 15:23.523
happy pills, egg rolls,
hug drugs.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.059
Uh, dancing shoes...

15:26.093 --> 15:27.194
Taken separately,

15:27.227 --> 15:28.228
neither of these
substances

15:28.261 --> 15:29.662
would prove fatal.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.731
But they were
taken together.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.267
That caused a lethal reaction,

15:34.301 --> 15:36.703
which sent Jones
into cardiac arrest.

15:36.736 --> 15:40.407
This is the rope that we found
tied around the body bag.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.975
I was just about to
bring it up to Abby.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.277
These corresponding
marks on his ankles

15:44.311 --> 15:46.046
suggest that he
was tied down,

15:46.079 --> 15:49.316
uh, weighed down with
something quite heavy.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.683
Strange, though,
the line isn't

15:50.717 --> 15:52.485
frayed or cut.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.421
The knot must have
slipped loose.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.130
Ah, it's Ginger and Mary Ann.
Welcome back.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.397
How was your
three-hour tour?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.000
I have never been so happy

16:07.034 --> 16:08.535
to see these orange walls.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.238
All right, the ship
wasn't that bad.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.639
Huh? What?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.275
Maybe to you.
I was in the freezer.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.012
My body temperature still
has not gotten back to normal.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.213
What about the crew?
Well, the ship is
on lockdown,

16:20.247 --> 16:22.215
so no one's going anywhere.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.616
Anything on Petty Officer Jones?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.618
Nothing.
The kid was squeaky-clean.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.287
No police records,
no debts.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.422
The guy's credit score
is better than mine.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.524
Hmm, no previous
drug issues?

16:31.558 --> 16:32.659
No, his sister
was adamant

16:32.692 --> 16:34.427
that he just
wasn't into drugs.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.163
Siblings don't always
tell each other the truth.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.331
Maybe he was ashamed
to tell her.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.633
TORRES: Except Jones
was so hyper-aware

16:40.667 --> 16:42.269
of his blood-pressure
medication

16:42.302 --> 16:44.204
that he wouldn't even
drink coffee.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.705
I mean, he avoided caffeine,
and he decided

16:45.738 --> 16:47.507
to dabble in ecstasy?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.776
Does that make sense
to anyone?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.744
McGEE:
Delilah and I
are not fighting.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.148
That's good,
'cause you would not like it

16:55.182 --> 16:57.417
if I took sides.
Why, what are you saying?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.719
That you would take
Delilah's side over mine?
Yep.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.254
You think, just because
I'm your best man,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.090
that I'm gonna agree
with everything you say?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.758
Yes.
Well, think again, Buster.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.827
You've got to be
kidding me.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.164
Partnership is a
50-50 thing, McGee.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.565
You've got to step up.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.633
Abby, I'm aware
of this, okay,

17:13.666 --> 17:14.667
and I already agreed
to make more

17:14.701 --> 17:16.503
of an effort with the wedding.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.571
But can we please talk
about something else?
Sure.

17:18.605 --> 17:22.375
How about Petty Officer Jones'
stomach content?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.311
You found something.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.346
The MDMA in Jones' system

17:26.379 --> 17:28.448
wasn't just your
run-of-the-mill pill.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.417
It was a capsule full
of crystalline powder.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.684
What's the difference?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.753
It's practically like
a double dosage.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.389
Meaning that the side effects
would be twice as strong.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.426
Like, intense euphoria
and trippy hallucinations,

17:39.459 --> 17:42.529
and a serious jolt
to your heart rate.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.364
Making for a death
sentence for Jones.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.832
Yeah.
Check this out.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.667
The highest concentration
of the drug

17:47.700 --> 17:49.536
was found in the
undigested food

17:49.569 --> 17:51.404
that was still
in Jones' stomach.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.606
The powder was mixed in
with his sweet potatoes.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.243
Why would he do that?
He wouldn't.

17:56.276 --> 18:00.147
I think someone
laced Jones' food

18:00.180 --> 18:02.749
with the MDMA,
and it killed him.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.588
MDMA?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.391
It's an illegal
party drug that...

18:11.424 --> 18:13.226
I-I know what it is,
I just can't imagine

18:13.260 --> 18:14.461
Petty Officer Jones
taking it.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.795
He was not that kind of kid.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.564
He didn't take it,
exactly.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.332
Somebody slipped it
into his food.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.800
More specifically,
his sweet potatoes.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.472
Are you sure about that?
Mm-hmm, it's where

18:25.505 --> 18:27.574
it was concentrated
in his stomach contents.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.578
It says here the crew
had spaghetti that night.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.313
No sweet potatoes
on the menu?

18:39.286 --> 18:40.353
Commander.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.488
Just on mine.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.623
I-I special order them.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.426
Only this time, when
Jones brought 'em out,

18:46.459 --> 18:48.928
I had already lost
my appetite, so...

18:48.961 --> 18:50.563
So you offered them
to Jones.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.531
I didn't... I didn't know.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.899
Those drugs were
meant for you.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.903
I guess so.
But why?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.905
You have any issues
with anyone on your crew?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.674
With over 200 in my command,
I can pretty much guarantee

19:01.708 --> 19:05.345
there are more than a few issues
I don't know about.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.913
What crew members had access

19:06.946 --> 19:08.648
to your meals, Commander?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.617
Just the food service team.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.188
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Lights out. Lights out.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.589
All hands turn in...

19:16.623 --> 19:19.659
Talk about a needle
in a haystack.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.695
I don't know, maybe not.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.564
(pills rattle)

19:24.597 --> 19:26.466
So sailors get headaches?

19:26.499 --> 19:29.236
Don't be so naive, Quinn.
Oh.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.874
Oh. Uh...

19:34.907 --> 19:36.243
(chuckles)

19:36.276 --> 19:38.545
All right,
if you had ecstasy,

19:38.578 --> 19:39.579
where would you hide it?

19:39.612 --> 19:40.613
I wouldn't have ecstasy.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.549
Hey, speaking of headaches,

19:42.582 --> 19:44.417
are you gonna take a plus-one
to McGee's wedding?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.687
No, no.
You mean like a date?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.490
Yeah. Really?
Nah. Yeah.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.924
Weddings are weird enough
without the extra pressure.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.727
Oh, man, I totally agree.
I'm right there with you.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.664
Besides, it's way more fun
to watch all the creepy guys

19:57.697 --> 19:59.499
troll the wedding,
looking for single women

19:59.532 --> 20:00.700
to hook up with.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.502
You know the type.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.504
Uh, sure.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.605
Yeah.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.640
I mean, I just...
I just know

20:07.674 --> 20:09.676
that sometimes real
relationships

20:09.709 --> 20:11.244
come out of those hookups.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.513
Really?
I don't think so.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.516
Anyone going after
such low-hanging fruit,

20:16.549 --> 20:18.685
they're not really interested
in a relationship.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.587
It's actually quite pathetic.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.524
Uh, I wouldn't
call it pathetic.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.460
I don't know, but maybe
I'm just the romantic type.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.630
Oh...
What is this?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.831
Not aspirin.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.266
Whose bunk?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.967
Petty Officer Haring.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.669
So much for our
innocent buddy.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.771
Huh.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.444
Sorry I'm late.

20:44.477 --> 20:48.748
All right, 300 invitations,
here I come.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.651
Delilah?

20:53.586 --> 20:56.289
DELILAH:
Hey. Yeah, I'm in here.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.295
Hey.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.396
Hi.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.864
Wow, is that the time?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.899
Yeah, it's 9:30. You okay?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.701
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
I just hit a wall,

21:08.735 --> 21:09.902
going over the invitations;

21:09.936 --> 21:12.539
I thought I'd lay down
for a minute,

21:12.572 --> 21:14.674
and suddenly,
it's two hours later.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.377
Oh, well, obviously,
you needed it.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.412
You've been burning
the candles at both ends.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.680
Mmm.
I'll tell you what:
you lay down,

21:20.713 --> 21:22.749
I will go work on
the invitations,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.884
and what I don't get to,
we'll do in the morning.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.586
No. Honey, we can't.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.589
I want to feel like
we accomplished some work today.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.625
That's what this is beginning
to feel like, is work, huh?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.394
You know, it's our wedding,
it's supposed to be fun.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.596
And it will be fun.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.698
As soon as we get
the invitations in the mail.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.468
There's only one guest I really
care about coming, anyway.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.502
Who?
What do you mean, who?

21:42.535 --> 21:43.903
You.
Aw.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.406
Me, too, you.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.341
But we're not guests, Tim,
we're the main event.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.977
Will you please grab my chair?

21:51.010 --> 21:54.814
But we are also two highly
trained, skilled individuals

21:54.847 --> 21:57.116
who have done much more
stressful things

21:57.149 --> 21:58.551
than throwing
a wedding.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.820
So I think
we will be okay.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.955
You all right?

22:02.989 --> 22:03.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Delilah.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.658
No, no, no, no.
Delilah, Delilah.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.627
Wake up. Come on, wake up,
honey, wake up, wake up.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.996
Can you hear me?
Wake up, honey,
come on, come on.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.876
TORRES:
Hey, Haring?

22:23.910 --> 22:26.713
Sing me one of
them old classics.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.682
You know, the one called,
uh, "Those aren't mine."

22:29.716 --> 22:31.884
They aren't mine, I swear.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.953
Someone must've
planted them there.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.655
Oh, that's my favorite.
(chuckles)

22:35.688 --> 22:36.856
That's the one.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.591
Now, why would someone do that?
I don't know.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.159
Look, you got to believe me.
I told you,

22:40.192 --> 22:42.429
I have no beef with Jonesy.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.996
Hmm.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.699
What about your C.O.?

22:46.733 --> 22:48.668
Whoa, what?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.770
What does the commander
have to do with this?

22:53.906 --> 22:56.776
Bowline, Haring. Tie me one. Go.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.745
Bowline?
The knot.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.113
Go.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.416
Are you checking to see
if he was a Boy Scout

23:03.450 --> 23:04.717
or a good sailor?
I've been both.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.887
Bowline.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.959
Clove hitch. Go.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.193
You gonna tell me
why I'm being tested?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.127
Tie the damn rope, Haring.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.498
Okay.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.502
Clove hitch.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.614
QUINN:
Well, so what's next, Gibbs?

23:34.647 --> 23:35.448
You gonna have him knit you
a sweater?

23:35.482 --> 23:37.149
He's not our guy.
How do we know that?

23:37.183 --> 23:39.118
The rope around the body
was tied in a granny knot.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.920
It's amateur,
it's sloppy.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.889
It's all wrong
for weighing down a body.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.691
Unlike this perfect clove hitch.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.492
Like you would know
an imperfect one?

23:45.525 --> 23:47.627
I passed basic seamanship,
sister.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.495
Not every sailor has.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.662
All right,
so we go back to the ship,

23:49.696 --> 23:50.797
and we perform this test

23:50.830 --> 23:51.964
with the whole crew.
(phone ringing)

23:51.998 --> 23:52.832
It might not tell us
who the killer is,

23:52.865 --> 23:54.133
but it might narrow down
our suspects.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.968
Yeah, McGee.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.570
What?

23:57.604 --> 24:00.239
Where? Whoa, whoa.
Slow, whoa... Slow down.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.575
Slow down.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.979
Hey. Hey,
how is she?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.748
They're still running tests.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.483
You should've called last night.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.151
Boss, I was a mess,
I was totally a mess.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.086
Delilah was out cold until
the paramedics arrived.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.221
She's gonna be okay.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.222
What if she's not?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.223
She will be.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.691
She will be.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.093
Come on, sit down.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.695
Boss, when Delilah was
paralyzed, the doctors said

24:22.729 --> 24:23.763
that there could be
more complications...

24:23.796 --> 24:25.197
McGee.
...down the road.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.534
What if this is now,
what if this is down the road?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.035
This is down the road.
Tim.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.538
Take a breath.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.807
All right? Come on,
have a seat.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.616
Wedding invitations.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.252
That's what we were talking
about when she went down.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.254
If those are our last words,
I swear...

24:48.287 --> 24:49.589
No.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.290
Won't be.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.525
Keep breathing.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.995
It's like, all the little things

24:56.028 --> 24:57.830
that we get so worked up
every day,

24:57.864 --> 24:59.599
we ignore what matters most.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.701
Look at me.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.037
Let's just wait, okay?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.306
Wait and see.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.041
And breathe?

25:09.075 --> 25:10.843
Oh, yeah.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.044
(chuckles)

25:12.078 --> 25:13.179
And breathe.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.021
(inhales, exhales)

25:22.054 --> 25:24.857
*

25:24.891 --> 25:27.627
What can I do, Abby?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.596
You could tell me
Delilah's okay.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.331
No word yet; Gibbs wants me
to fill in until she is.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.033
So, what have we got?

25:34.066 --> 25:38.337
Uh, major mass spec
matched the MDMA

25:38.370 --> 25:41.841
found under Haring's bunk
to the MDMA

25:41.874 --> 25:43.976
that killed Petty Officer Jones.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.878
Though we're fairly certain
Haring's not our guy.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.247
Are you saying
it's the exact same strain?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.583
Well, it's the exact same
capsule.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.951
Known on the street as...

25:51.984 --> 25:53.119
Blue Burgers.
Blue Burgers. You know them?

25:53.152 --> 25:54.954
Yeah, I worked
narcotics back home.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.589
I know they're very popular.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.991
Double dose and high intensity.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.761
They look nothing like
my kind of burger.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.295
Just hung up with my
friend Betty at the DEA.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.831
And what did your
friend Betty say?

26:04.864 --> 26:06.599
Well, her office

26:06.633 --> 26:08.300
has been trying for months
to nail a dealer in Norfolk

26:08.334 --> 26:10.269
who specializes in Blue Burgers.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.804
Do you have a name?

26:11.838 --> 26:12.839
Yep, uh, Vernon Palumbo.

26:12.872 --> 26:13.940
Apparently, a big fixture

26:13.973 --> 26:15.675
in the Norfolk bar scene.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.845
Okay, Vernon Palumbo.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.113
He's got a long juvie record,
mostly narcotics.

26:21.147 --> 26:25.251
He was paroled last year
from Norfolk Detention Center.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.119
Fancy a drive, Ellie?

26:27.153 --> 26:28.821
Only if I'm driving.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.658
He has trouble staying out
of the left side of the road.

26:31.691 --> 26:32.659
(laughs softly)

26:32.692 --> 26:34.193
It was one time.
(whispering):
More than once.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.195
It was one time, Ellie.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.402
No, no, you keep
checking, Torres.

26:43.435 --> 26:48.007
Until we hear from Bishop and
Reeves, no one leaves that ship.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.376
No.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.178
There is no news.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.881
I'll let you know
when there is.

26:54.914 --> 26:58.184
What's the latest?

26:58.217 --> 27:01.287
No news for you, either.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.690
Why does everybody have
to know everything?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.424
Isn't that our jobs?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.927
Delilah!
Thank you for
keeping him company.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.428
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.363
Oh, I got a whopper
of a headache. How are you?

27:11.397 --> 27:12.865
I'm better if you're better.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.233
All right, well, come on,
they're gonna move us

27:14.266 --> 27:15.868
to a room
while doctors compare notes.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.369
Agent Gibbs,
you're welcome to stick around.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.105
No, no. You two go ahead.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.707
Hey, uh, let me know.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.774
Okay.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.710
Boss...

27:29.716 --> 27:31.951
(rock music playing, laughter,
indistinct chatter)

27:34.420 --> 27:36.422
Ha.
(sniffles)

27:36.455 --> 27:37.924
Vernon.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.358
How you doing?

27:39.391 --> 27:42.228
Heard you're a man
who knows how to get things.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.030
Is that right?
Yeah.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.297
And you are?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.432
I'm Clayton.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.335
That's my girl over there,
Ellie.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.705
Hmm.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.874
We're actually heading down
to Miami for the weekend.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.376
Was, uh, hoping to make things
a little bit more interesting.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.311
Let me stop you there.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.180
First of all, you're
obviously a cop.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.717
So is your girl there.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.321
You seem awfully sure
of that, Vernon, uh,

28:09.355 --> 28:10.923
is there not
a "second of all," or...

28:10.957 --> 28:14.026
Second, that's the worst
British accent I ever heard.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.828
Now, whatever it is you
think I can "get" you,

28:15.862 --> 28:17.764
you won't find on me now, so,

28:17.797 --> 28:19.932
(English accent):
take a walk, mate.

28:19.966 --> 28:22.902
Well, you're as good
as advertised, Vernon.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.772
Law enforcement's
clearly no match for you.

28:25.805 --> 28:26.839
Then why are you still here?

28:26.873 --> 28:28.440
Look.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.278
It's not your Blue
Burgers we're after.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.913
We need a name.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.348
A face, you know,
whichever comes first.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.950
Let's just say, hypothetically,

28:37.984 --> 28:41.754
you sold some ecstasy to
a young sailor a week or so ago.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.089
You expect me to remember?

28:43.122 --> 28:45.792
You know, "hypothetically"?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.293
Well, if not,

28:47.326 --> 28:48.795
we could not so hypothetically
bring you down

28:48.828 --> 28:50.429
for questioning
for a few days.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.463
A few days?
Yeah.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.464
On what charge?

28:52.498 --> 28:54.133
Doubting my accent.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.302
And while we question you,
it'll sure look

28:56.335 --> 28:58.437
like you're cooperating with us,
whether you are or not.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.272
That can't be good for business.
Mm-mm.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.008
Or your health.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.477
Yeah.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.380
And when would I have
encountered this sailor

29:08.414 --> 29:09.481
you're looking for?

29:09.515 --> 29:10.917
Well...

29:17.056 --> 29:18.825
You know you're gonna be fine,
right?

29:18.858 --> 29:19.892
Yeah, I know.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.560
You sure you know?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.494
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:22.528 --> 29:25.031
I know.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.465
Well, if I'm not...

29:26.498 --> 29:28.334
Don't go there.
Don't go where, hon?

29:28.367 --> 29:30.569
There's here, there is here,
we're here now.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.804
This is happening.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.239
And everything's gonna be fine.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.206
I'm just saying,
if it's not...

29:34.240 --> 29:36.042
Then whatever it is,
we'll deal with it, okay?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.243
Can I finish, hon?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.477
Sorry.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.511
I'm just saying,
if it's not,

29:39.545 --> 29:41.814
we're still okay. Hey.

29:41.848 --> 29:45.051
As long as we have
each other, we're okay.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.485
Okay.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.920
Okay, then.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.589
"Okay" what?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.491
Have you slept, Agent McGee?

29:52.524 --> 29:54.160
No. Yes. Uh, doesn't matter.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.327
How's Delilah?

29:55.361 --> 29:56.362
She's fine.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.897
Really?
Really.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.432
Yes, aside from a mild
concussion from your fall,

30:00.466 --> 30:02.268
brain function is
completely normal.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.836
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.537
That's great news.
Same with the blood tests.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.875
The recent stress likely
contributed to you passing out.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.177
But only because you're
a tad anemic right now,

30:11.210 --> 30:12.578
and that's to be expected, so...

30:12.611 --> 30:16.082
Wait, what?
Why is that to be expected?

30:16.115 --> 30:18.250
Well, in your current condition.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.391
Oh.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.558
Wow.

30:26.592 --> 30:27.894
You don't know.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.930
Know what?

30:30.963 --> 30:32.932
You're expecting.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.367
Expecting what?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.903
A baby.

30:40.606 --> 30:44.010
You're pregnant,
about ten weeks.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.848
(gasps)
Oh.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.352
That's exactly
how I imagined it.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.096
(phone ringing,
elevator bell dings)

31:04.130 --> 31:06.332
(indistinct announcement
over P.A. system)

31:06.365 --> 31:07.633
NURSE:
Hey, Abby.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.675
Oh, my God.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.676
Not you, too?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.111
Hey, Abby.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.612
I'm okay, I just,
I just passed out.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.048
ABBY:
"Just"?

31:22.081 --> 31:24.183
People don't just pass out.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.484
It's okay, Abby, we're fine.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.586
You're not fine.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.656
You're glowing.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.024
Why are you glowing?

31:32.058 --> 31:33.559
We're not glowing.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.362
Mm, definitely glowing.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.197
I didn't stay up
all night worrying

31:38.230 --> 31:41.267
to not know why you are glowing.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.005
All right, Abby,
we haven't heard back

31:46.038 --> 31:48.240
from Delilah's mom yet,
so until she knows,

31:48.274 --> 31:49.508
you can't tell anyone.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.978
Seriously?

31:52.011 --> 31:53.579
Just until we let family know.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.548
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.184
But...

31:58.217 --> 31:59.585
seriously?

32:03.355 --> 32:08.660
This... is... the
best news ever!

32:08.694 --> 32:10.997
(chuckles)

32:11.030 --> 32:13.099
Been through half the crew
so far and only half of them

32:13.132 --> 32:15.001
know how to
tie Navy knots.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.336
Uh, your rope trick is great
for eliminating suspects,

32:17.369 --> 32:19.171
but not exactly
finding them.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.572
You' re on speaker,
Bishop, how'd it go?

32:20.606 --> 32:23.309
And then there
were three, Gibbs.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.311
Three crew members
from the McGuire

32:25.344 --> 32:28.180
that our dealer Palumbo thinks
he may have done business with.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.015
Anyone we know?

32:29.048 --> 32:30.516
Matter of fact,
Clayton's texting over

32:30.549 --> 32:32.251
the one we
know right now.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.353
Stoddard, the food
service officer.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.654
Is Agent Quinn with you?

32:35.687 --> 32:37.323
Yeah, Clay, I'm here

32:37.356 --> 32:40.292
and, uh, just received
your text.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.995
Wait, isn't he the guy who found
Jones dead in the first place?

32:54.640 --> 32:57.276
GIBBS:
(sniffs) Mm-mm!

32:57.309 --> 32:58.477
Sure does smell good.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.447
I hope you don't mind.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.748
Actually,
you're violating

33:02.781 --> 33:04.583
quite a few regulations.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.252
Tell me you washed
your hands, at least.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.120
Oh, yeah,
mine are clean.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.421
How about yours?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.124
I scrub in like a
surgeon for every meal.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.360
Now, if you don't mind,
lunch isn't for another hour.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.228
These regulations,

33:16.262 --> 33:18.097
they meant to keep anybody
from wandering in here

33:18.130 --> 33:19.598
and messing with the food?

33:19.631 --> 33:22.101
That's the basic
idea, yeah.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.302
Hmm.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.571
Only authorized personnel
like yourself

33:25.604 --> 33:27.606
have access to everything
that comes out of this place?

33:27.639 --> 33:29.041
What are getting at,
Agent Gibbs?

33:30.576 --> 33:33.179
He's getting at whatever problem
you have with the commander.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.746
You know what
this needs?

33:34.780 --> 33:38.384
Grape jelly.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.518
I don't have a problem
with the commander,

33:39.551 --> 33:42.354
but I'll have him on both
your asses in two seconds

33:42.388 --> 33:44.056
if you don't get the hell...
There really is
nothing to eat here.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.224
I just want a burger.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.559
You know, really rare,
almost blue.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.428
Do you have anything like that?

33:58.404 --> 33:59.538
I don't know
what you think I did...

33:59.571 --> 34:01.039
We don't think, Stoddard.

34:07.113 --> 34:08.680
It was an accident, okay?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.385
Just a prank.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.254
I didn't mean for anybody
to get hurt.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.590
You did way more
than hurt Jonesy.
It was meant for the commander.

34:18.624 --> 34:21.427
Not to kill him, just to get him
back for busting our humps.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.362
Jonesy eating his food
was a fluke.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.830
Like throwing
his body overboard?

34:24.863 --> 34:27.233
And planting the drugs
in Haring's bunk?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.268
That a fluke, too?

34:29.301 --> 34:30.569
No.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.141
I was just stupid.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.576
When I saw the commander's
empty plate

34:37.609 --> 34:39.778
next to Jonesy's body,
I-I just...

34:39.811 --> 34:41.647
I thought it was
gonna come back to me.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.316
I guess I panicked.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.317
Okay?

34:45.351 --> 34:47.853
I'm sorry.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.421
I really am.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.793
BISHOP:
It's a little late
for an apology.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.395
Yeah, he kept calling
it, uh, an accident,

34:56.428 --> 34:57.529
a total fluke.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.298
Seems like him and
our ecstasy dealer

34:59.331 --> 35:00.766
are made for
each other.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.335
Hey, you guys got
the good news, right?

35:03.369 --> 35:04.436
Delilah's okay?

35:04.470 --> 35:06.372
Yes, uh, thank goodness.
Yep.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.873
Just a fainting spell.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.475
Probably just stress, you know,

35:09.508 --> 35:11.177
from planning the
wedding and all,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.878
but she's okay now.
TORRES:
Well, that's great.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.547
Anything else?

35:15.581 --> 35:17.216
What? No, no.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.484
(chuckles nervously)

35:18.517 --> 35:20.352
No.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.653
Why would there be
something else?

35:21.687 --> 35:22.721
Heh.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.191
I mean... I mean,
that good news,

35:25.224 --> 35:26.692
that's... enough
good news, right?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.327
Uh, yes.
ABBY: Yeah.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.629
VANCE: That's very
good news indeed,

35:30.662 --> 35:32.498
Miss Sciuto, but
I have a question.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.500
Actually,
question's for you,

35:34.533 --> 35:35.734
Agent Gibbs.

35:38.270 --> 35:41.440
Do you have any idea why McGee
would invite me to his home

35:41.473 --> 35:42.541
for dinner tonight?

35:42.574 --> 35:43.809
Why?

35:45.411 --> 35:47.379
Why not?
Well, it...

35:48.847 --> 35:51.483
...it's not the invitation,
it's the wording of the e-mail.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.585
He marked it "personal" and...

35:53.619 --> 35:55.521
I was asked not
to tell anybody.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.423
Yet you're telling me.
Well, you're not anybody.

35:57.456 --> 35:58.457
And...

35:58.490 --> 35:59.725
and it's just odd.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.294
Short notice,
the secrecy.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.230
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, they invited me.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.332
I'm gonna be there.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.399
You will?
Mm-hmm.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.835
Uh, me, me too.
Same invitation?

36:09.868 --> 36:11.803
Yeah, I got one too.
Me, three.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.972
We all got invited,
apparently.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.475
Well, not much of
a secret then, is it?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.610
Huh, why now? Why tonight?

36:18.644 --> 36:21.613
I know, so suddenly.
So soon after
Delilah passed out.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.785
Abby?

36:36.495 --> 36:38.764
QUINN:
Wow, place looks good as new.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.532
Doesn't it? I mean,
you'd never know

36:40.566 --> 36:42.000
the awful things
that happened here.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.403
But we know.
I still wish I didn't.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.837
McGEE: Hey, everyone,
it won't be much longer.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.273
DELILAH: Sorry to
keep you all waiting.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.408
Dinner is almost ready,
I promise.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.277
McGEE: Actually,
dinner is ready,

36:51.310 --> 36:53.379
but, uh, we're just keeping
it warm until we can...

36:53.412 --> 36:54.580
tell you all something.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.448
We have a little
announcement to make.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.584
Some good news
to share.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.885
Because you're all
so special to us,

36:59.918 --> 37:02.688
we wanted to tell you
all together, at once.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.689
They already know.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.923
What? Abbs?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.525
I'm sorry.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.694
I got really,
really excited

37:08.727 --> 37:10.762
and then
I totally blew it.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.931
And I'm sorry.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.433
It's all right,
you didn't blow it.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.702
Actually, no,
she did kind of blow it.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.437
Hey, I got ahold of
my mom this morning,

37:18.470 --> 37:20.306
so our families are covered;
it is all good.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.275
It's not all good,
it's all wonderful!

37:23.309 --> 37:24.810
That's right.
Congratulations.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.278
(applause)

37:26.312 --> 37:27.879
(chuckles)
McGEE:
Thanks, guys.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.615
But that is not the
only reason you're here.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.049
There is one more
piece of business,

37:31.082 --> 37:32.918
and it is actually
the real reason

37:32.951 --> 37:34.886
we asked you to
be here tonight.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.054
McGEE: As you know,
we've been planning

37:36.087 --> 37:37.823
our-our big summer wedding,

37:37.856 --> 37:40.559
but with a baby on the way,
we didn't want to wait.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.494
DELILAH: My mom found out
she's gonna be a grandma,

37:42.528 --> 37:43.962
so the wedding somehow
took a back seat.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.697
McGEE: In a few weeks,
we'll have a party

37:45.731 --> 37:48.066
for out-of-town family,
but right now,

37:48.099 --> 37:50.469
we want to share something
with our other family.

37:50.502 --> 37:54.039
One that means more to us than
we could ever tell you guys.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.507
Mm-hmm.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.975
So with you all of you here,

37:57.008 --> 37:58.810
we'd like to get married.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.612
But-- what...
for real?

38:00.646 --> 38:02.748
You mean, like, like, right
now? Like, right here?

38:02.781 --> 38:05.016
Right here in Tony's
creepy old apartment, Nick.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.052
Just replace bad
karma with good.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.587
Abby, you're still
my best person.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.656
Unfortunately, we had
a bit of a problem

38:10.689 --> 38:12.924
getting Delilah's sister on
a flight out to London, so...

38:12.958 --> 38:13.959
What do you say, Gibbs?

38:15.461 --> 38:16.562
Be my man of honor?

38:16.595 --> 38:19.365
Be my honor.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.600
Well, in that case,
may I be the one

38:21.633 --> 38:23.068
to give you away?

38:23.101 --> 38:24.870
My father's looking down
right now,

38:24.903 --> 38:26.738
and I am sure
he would approve, Ducky.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.006
(chuckles)
Thank you.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.108
Mm.
VANCE:
Well, then,

38:30.141 --> 38:32.744
all you need now is
a priest or a rabbi or...

38:32.778 --> 38:33.845
Or a minister?

38:33.879 --> 38:35.714
Way ahead of
you, Director,

38:35.747 --> 38:37.816
McGee asked me this morning.
Dr. Palmer is now fully licensed

38:37.849 --> 38:39.084
for such occasions.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.453
All it took was
20 minutes online and,

38:41.487 --> 38:44.690
thanks to the
Interfaith Inspiration Church,

38:44.723 --> 38:47.659
you can now all refer to me
as "Reverend Jimmy."

38:47.693 --> 38:49.060
(laughter)

38:50.729 --> 38:51.997
Let's get this show
on the road, people.

38:52.030 --> 38:52.931
Come on, let's do it.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.533
Yeah!
Okay.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.948
Hey, you okay?

39:09.981 --> 39:12.884
Yeah, just having a little
problem with these cufflinks.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.726
Admiral stars, that's nice.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.694
They were my dad's.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.896
Figured I'd wear them,
almost like him being here.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.833
Oh, he's here.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.571
All right.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.872
What do you think?

39:37.075 --> 39:39.177
Well...

39:39.210 --> 39:40.712
I think...

39:43.081 --> 39:44.550
Here.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.421
Boss, I think something
borrowed is more for the bride.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.922
No, that's not borrowed,
that's yours.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.697
My mom gave it to my dad
when they got married.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.166
It's right before
he shipped out.

40:01.199 --> 40:04.069
My dad gave that to me
on my wedding day.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.842
I only wear it on
special occasions.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.077
You wore it tonight.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.614
Well, yeah.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.783
I had a feeling.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.789
Boss, you sure there's no one
else you'd rather give this to?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.925
Who better than you, Tim?

40:38.737 --> 40:39.805
Thank you, boss.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.210
("She Blinded Me with Science"
by Thomas Dolby begins)

40:45.243 --> 40:46.678
(softly):
Hey.

40:46.712 --> 40:47.813
Now that's a tux.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.681
Ooh. Triple woof.

40:49.715 --> 40:53.985
* It's poetry in motion...

40:54.019 --> 40:57.022
Can you believe it?
Oh...

40:57.055 --> 41:00.559
* As deep as any ocean...

41:00.592 --> 41:03.862
* As sweet as any harmony

41:03.895 --> 41:07.999
* But she blinded me
with science *

41:08.033 --> 41:11.069
* She blinded me with science!

41:11.102 --> 41:12.538
(chuckles)

41:12.571 --> 41:14.039
Thanks, Duck.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.741
* She failed me in biology,
yeah... *

41:15.774 --> 41:18.009
JIMMY: Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

41:18.043 --> 41:21.713
to lovingly unite our good
friends Timothy and Delilah

41:21.747 --> 41:24.583
in the joyful bonds
of holy matrimony.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.786
Now, Tim, repeat after me:

41:27.819 --> 41:29.588
"I, Timothy McGee..."

41:29.621 --> 41:31.623
I, Timothy McGee...
"...take you,

41:31.657 --> 41:32.758
Delilah Fielding..."

41:32.791 --> 41:34.092
...take you, Delilah Fielding...

41:34.125 --> 41:35.761
"...to be my lawfully
wedded wife."

41:35.794 --> 41:37.563
...to be my lawfully
wedded wife.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.964
JIMMY: "I, Delilah
Fielding..."

41:38.997 --> 41:40.632
I, Delilah Fielding...

41:40.666 --> 41:42.133
"...take you, Timothy McGee..."

41:42.167 --> 41:43.835
...take you, Timothy McGee...

41:43.869 --> 41:45.871
"...to be my lawfully
wedded husband..."

41:45.904 --> 41:47.773
...to be my lawfully
wedded husband...

41:47.806 --> 41:49.240
"...in sickness
and in health..."

41:49.274 --> 41:50.676
...in sickness and in health...

41:50.709 --> 41:52.010
"...in good times and in bad..."

41:52.043 --> 41:53.812
...in good times and in bad...

41:53.845 --> 41:55.547
"...for as long as we
both shall live."

41:55.581 --> 41:57.883
McGEE AND DELILAH:
...for as long as
we both shall live.

41:57.916 --> 41:58.550
JIMMY:
Now,

41:58.584 --> 42:00.318
by the power
invested in me,

42:00.351 --> 42:04.189
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.259
* Poetry in motion...

42:08.293 --> 42:09.661
You should smooch.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.264
(cheering)

42:13.298 --> 42:15.133
* As deep as any ocean

42:15.166 --> 42:16.702
(laughter)

42:16.735 --> 42:18.169
* As sweet as

42:18.203 --> 42:20.739
* Any harmony
(whooping, whistling)

42:20.772 --> 42:23.742
* She blinded me with science!

42:23.775 --> 42:25.577
* She blinded me with...

42:25.611 --> 42:27.746
Congratulations, Tim.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.781
*
