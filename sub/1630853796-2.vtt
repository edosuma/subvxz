00:13.763 --> 00:15.473
Is Ruth trying to set us up?

00:15.557 --> 00:17.183
Yeah, I think she is.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.685
Huh.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.021
Is that appropriate?

00:22.272 --> 00:24.357
-No, it isn't.
-Right.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.984
That's what I… okay.

00:26.943 --> 00:30.780
Although I guess, technically,
we're not at work.

00:31.906 --> 00:32.741
Right.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.118
Bit of a gray area.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.498
We don't have to do this.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.293
Why? Are you scared?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.671
-I mean, now we have to do this.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.339
And since you like talking trash,

00:48.423 --> 00:50.091
-I'll let you go first.
-Okay.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.427
-Loser buys drinks?
-Sure.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.762
If you like spending your money.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.347
-I thought you never played before.
-I'm still gonna kick your ass.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.974
-Whatever, tough guy.
-All right.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.267
How does it work?

00:59.350 --> 01:00.727
Do I just aim at the bullseye?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.771
-At the bullseye.
-Mm-hm.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.399
-The 20, the rings inside the 20.
-Mm-hm.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.820
But first, you need to get to that plane.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.756
There's a satphone,
there's a radio.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.717
Find them and you can get help.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.253
Son of a bitch! Oh, my God!

02:09.921 --> 02:10.880
Shit!

02:12.006 --> 02:13.591
Shit! Oh, my God.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.178
Holly shit!

03:30.293 --> 03:31.586
Fuck!

04:06.996 --> 04:08.414
It's okay, Dad.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.857
Look, look, I'm just saying
it was a first-time handling discovery.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.068
But it wasn't his first time.
That's the point.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.320
She should have never have been
handling production

04:39.404 --> 04:41.781
-on the Williams thing in the first place.
-He was delegating.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.825
He was making a first-year
do his work for him.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.036
I just don't think it's that big a deal.
Mistakes happen, and we'll fix it up.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.329
It is a big deal.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.290
-She produced multiple…
-I know.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.709
-…privileged documents to the other side.
-I know.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.127
And that's on him.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.926
Look, it's nice that you're nice,

05:02.427 --> 05:04.512
but we're not paid to make mistakes.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.099
We need to be the best,
and we need to be that at all times.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.142
No, pressure.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.562
If he wants someone to hold his hand,
join a support group.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.896
So, is he getting fired?

05:14.897 --> 05:17.525
Of course, he's not getting fired.
What are we, monsters?

05:18.526 --> 05:21.446
But he thinks he is,
which is why we're here.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.656
And he's still at the office
doing everything he can

05:23.740 --> 05:25.366
to claw this thing back right now.

05:26.034 --> 05:26.993
Hmm.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.247
So, you think I'm nice?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.626
That's… that's what you got out
of the conversation?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.837
No, I just, I thought I heard
a compliment in there

05:37.920 --> 05:39.255
and I… I didn't want to miss it.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.049
No, nice is not a compliment.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.217
Nice is a liability.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.095
Jesus, Rivera. Were you born this cynical?

05:47.430 --> 05:48.598
I had to work at it.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.104
All right. Yeah, I think you're nice.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.440
I think you're too nice.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.401
I don't trust it.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.738
You should.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.157
Sometimes people
are just what they seem to be.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.408
You on the other hand…

06:07.492 --> 06:10.286
Now how in the hell did you become
a lawyer with a worldview like that?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.498
No, don't bend this back to me and work.
We're talking about you now.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.751
Work is me.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.505
That's it. That's all you are.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.883
According to my hours, basically. Yeah.

06:27.095 --> 06:27.929
Well…

06:29.222 --> 06:30.431
That's too bad.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.852
'Cause I was really looking forward
to meeting the rest of you.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.030
-Hey.
-Hey. Hi.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.700
Are you sneaking out on me?

07:30.783 --> 07:31.617
No.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.621
No, I just… I have to go in early
to do some stuff.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.916
-Wait, I'll make you some coffee.
-No, don't.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.668
I'll make some at home.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.961
Go back to bed. It's early.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.173
Okay. I'll see you at work.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.218
You're pretty great, you know that?

09:41.414 --> 09:46.419
KISSES, DAD

10:08.566 --> 10:09.692
Fuck.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.959
It's fucking cold. Holy shit.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.680
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.017
Okay.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.365
Piedra del Sol
A tree deep-rooted yet dancing still,

15:49.448 --> 15:50.699
a course of a river that turns,
moves on, doubles back,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.368
and comes full circle, forever arriving.
Octavio Paz

16:46.880 --> 16:47.923
Liv!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.466
Come on! You got to get up.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.678
No! No!

17:31.508 --> 17:32.551
Hey!

17:33.385 --> 17:34.511
Hey!

17:35.429 --> 17:36.513
Go away!

17:44.688 --> 17:45.981
-Hey!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.317
Shoo! Go, bear! Get!

18:11.173 --> 18:12.800
No! Hey!

18:13.592 --> 18:14.718
Go away!

18:15.344 --> 18:16.720
No!

18:16.804 --> 18:19.389
Fuck off! Get away!

18:19.473 --> 18:21.183
Fuck off!

18:21.266 --> 18:23.435
Fuck off! Go!

18:24.019 --> 18:25.312
Fuck off!

18:26.188 --> 18:29.024
Go away! Fuck off!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.317
Fuck off!

21:11.770 --> 21:12.980
Morning.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.106
Again.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.609
Morning.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.819
I think you forgot this.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.156
Thanks.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.581
I brought you something else.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.459
It's your winning dart.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.003
I stole it from the bar last night.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.713
Figure it's good luck.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.509
How's the motion coming?

21:44.052 --> 21:45.137
It's in motion.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.640
Did I do something?

21:48.724 --> 21:50.350
I'd like to see it before the meeting.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.984
Is there something else?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.947
No. I'll get back to work.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.968
We see this all the time.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.345
Sprinklers aren't much good
if they don't work.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.222
You should sue your building.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.434
Bad luck, I guess.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.895
Along with serious
smoke inhalation,

23:58.979 --> 24:01.898
your blood alcohol level
was over ten times the legal limit.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.026
They had to pump your stomach
and put you on hemodialysis.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.239
You're a lucky woman.
That fire probably saved your life.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.871
There's accidents
and then, there's accidents.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.583
I'm ten years sober.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.835
If you ever want to talk to someone,
I'm a good listener.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.549
Now, I know your lungs
probably feel like they're still on fire,

24:27.632 --> 24:31.052
but unfortunately, because of the baby,
we can't really put you on anything.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.058
How far along are you?

24:39.436 --> 24:40.479
What?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.149
The baby. How far along?

26:20.245 --> 26:21.329
Bye, Sam.

28:01.554 --> 28:02.889
Whoo!

29:11.458 --> 29:12.584
Nice fire.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.171
Not gonna get you fed, though.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.426
You think 'cause you can rub
two sticks together

29:21.509 --> 29:23.303
that you're gonna survive
on your own out here?

29:26.264 --> 29:27.807
You're just fucked in better light.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.189
There's nobody coming for you
because nobody cares about you.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.777
You've got nothing and no one.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.741
A few more days alone out here…

29:46.201 --> 29:47.827
and you're just as dead as I am.
