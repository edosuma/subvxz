Suppose they were to come here
to witness the benefits
of our medicine?

16:37.200 --> 16:41.120
I am told that the Indians value
evidence that displays
a superior god.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.120
You might use it to persuade them
towards conversion.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.800
You see politics
in a child's sickness?

16:46.880 --> 16:50.160
I do not require lessons in morality
from you, sir.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.920
Pepper, do as my wife wishes.
Deliver her brother.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
Governor...

17:03.560 --> 17:07.319
it occurred to me, if we can provide
some display of English science,

17:07.400 --> 17:10.640
it might persuade Opechancanough
to provide us with boys

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
to work on our farm
in exchange for learning.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.240
I might carry the notion.

17:15.319 --> 17:18.880
A woman? To talk on my behalf
before the Naturals?

17:18.960 --> 17:20.720
Never.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.920
Do you suppose that I would let
Opechancanough consider me so weak?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.560
It might happen, widow,
but not with you.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.720
What are you doing here, boy?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.760
Why aren't you at your own work?

17:50.960 --> 17:54.160
Didn't take Mistress Castell long
to have enough of you.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.160
Have you seen my husband?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.200
He went out the gates.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.320
If you find him, bring him back to me
and I'll feed you your breakfast.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.920
Master Read.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.080
You've set yourself
above the moral wheel of Jamestown.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.840
Was it you who removed
the head from the spike?

18:26.920 --> 18:30.960
The talk of the tavern is, Marshal,
that you wish to spare
your companion

18:31.040 --> 18:33.520
the same scorn in death
that he faced in life.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.200
Sir!

18:37.000 --> 18:41.720
What was the crime that saw such
a fine gentleman as Secretary Farlow

18:41.800 --> 18:44.440
separated from the seat of
his senses?

18:44.520 --> 18:48.560
For what sins had God put that hump
on your back?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.600
Luck has blessed me, Marshal,

18:50.680 --> 18:52.640
with not one ugliness, but two.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.400
So that I will never know
compliments, never expect kindness,

18:56.480 --> 18:58.240
never wish for flattery.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.560
In short, so that I am free of any
and all obligation to devotion or
friendship

19:02.640 --> 19:04.600
such as those that torment you.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.520
Now...

19:06.600 --> 19:08.840

19:10.600 --> 19:13.040

19:15.680 --> 19:20.240
I can sell the best goods here
as fast as I can ship them,
Master Read.

19:20.320 --> 19:24.960
Is there anywhere in this world
where a man might better
make a fortune?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
Those that have the fire for it.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.720
It must cost you quite a penny
to import such...

19:31.800 --> 19:33.480
fine furnishings.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.320
These are not my goods, sir.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.960
I am merely an exporter's factor,
here to drum on behalf of
better men.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.800
Who is it that you trade for?

19:43.160 --> 19:45.960
Isn't it marvellous
that men might grow rich?

19:46.040 --> 19:47.800
Women, too.

19:47.880 --> 19:52.320
Those that have land granted to them
might prosper beyond reckoning.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.640
Now there's a woman
who fears no God.

19:54.720 --> 20:00.520
Who could miss how she defied the
Governor and had every woman walk
from the Assembly?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.160
Oh...

20:02.240 --> 20:06.360
Oh, but wouldn't she make any man's
cock dance to her tune?

20:08.560 --> 20:12.280
I've seen how you look upon her,
Master Read.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.320
It is not enough to desire
such a beauty. She must be tamed.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.760
Oh? And how might a man do that?

20:18.840 --> 20:24.600
First, the lady must believe
that only he can see her truest
loveliness.

20:24.680 --> 20:28.120
Only he can perceive the wonder
at the core of her.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.880
And do you suppose that the widow
would be so easily duped, sir?

20:32.960 --> 20:37.560
The best deception is served
with sincerity.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.800
I will show you how it is done.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.760

They know the herbs

34:48.239 --> 34:50.199
Your son died at three years old,

34:50.280 --> 34:53.560
while you were in the alehouse
filling your throat.

34:53.639 --> 34:56.159
You've told me so yourself
many times.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.880
A dead child don't come back.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.960
Meredith?

35:09.040 --> 35:12.400
Henry... Henry is a man broken by
sorrow. That's...

35:12.480 --> 35:14.720
That's only his own loss speaking.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.760
Meredith? Meredith?

36:10.520 --> 36:12.520
Would you take me?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.360
Would you?
(GASPS)

36:14.440 --> 36:18.000
Would you make a fool out of me?
You...get up!

36:18.080 --> 36:19.840
Come here.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.240
Get out of my tavern!

36:23.400 --> 36:25.800
You ain't no son of mine!

36:25.880 --> 36:28.040
No son of mine!

36:28.120 --> 36:30.280
Now get out of here!

36:30.360 --> 36:32.760
(COUGHS)
Go on! Off!

36:32.840 --> 36:34.920
(DISTANT DOG BARKS)

37:31.480 --> 37:33.480
This is my fault.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.960
I should have told my husband
he was bewildered.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.560
I should never have allowed you
to pretend that you were his boy.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.600
That was your kindness to him.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.640
And...

37:44.720 --> 37:47.080
he will see that.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
Tam?

37:56.720 --> 37:58.720
Aaa-aaah!

37:58.800 --> 38:01.160
It don't matter
that you're not our blood.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.840
I'm here to tell you
that you have a home.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.040
Here with us.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.080
Where you can live.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.320
Where you'll never be cast out.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.760
(WINCES)

38:22.600 --> 38:27.320
Ma'am, I told him, I said,
'My mistress isn't here, you must
wait for her return.'

38:27.400 --> 38:32.240
But, ma'am, he would not listen,
he simply carried it into the house
and placed it down.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.760
(GASPS)

38:52.840 --> 38:54.840
What?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.520
You've come to look at the blood on
my hand, have you?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.960
Does that prove, does it,
that you were right?

39:00.040 --> 39:02.600
And I was wrong about the boy.
He took a knife to me.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.360
Oh, he's a dangerous beast!

39:05.360 --> 39:07.880
I hope that you choke on your virtue.

39:09.960 --> 39:13.360
(VOICE BREAKS) I'm trying to pray
to a God I don't believe in.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.400
I would pray to the clouds,

39:15.480 --> 39:17.440
I would pray to the birds,

39:17.520 --> 39:19.480
I would pray to you...I...

39:19.560 --> 39:21.520
I would pray to the bastard...

39:21.600 --> 39:24.960
doorknob, if I thought it would give
that child one moment

39:25.040 --> 39:27.000
of knowing he is loved...

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
..he is wanted.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
(CHOKES BACK TEARS)

39:37.080 --> 39:39.520
Sure, Meredith thinks that
Tam is like him.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.600
But...

39:44.960 --> 39:46.960
..he is the same as me.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.680
Willmus Crabtree.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.720
He claims to be a man of trade,

40:16.800 --> 40:20.440
when everything about him admits
that he is something of a hunter.

40:20.520 --> 40:24.200
Why do you say that? When Governor
Yeardley stepped out of his house

40:24.280 --> 40:27.840
carrying Secretary Farlow's head,
the world had its eyes on him.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.600
Willmus Crabtree slipped into
Yeardley's house, quiet as a mouse.

40:31.680 --> 40:36.000
What did he want in there? I don't
think he was mourning the loss of
the dead man.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.640
(INDISTINCT GREETINGS)

40:39.800 --> 40:41.600
Why did he do that?

40:41.680 --> 40:44.680
Cos he knows who took the head
from the spike.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.120
And you saw who stole it, didn't you?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.920
It was our Governor himself.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.960
(FLIES BUZZING)

41:01.960 --> 41:03.960
(BUZZING INTENSIFIES)

41:11.520 --> 41:13.640
(GASPS)

41:16.680 --> 41:18.680
(RUMBLE OF THUNDER)

41:32.040 --> 41:34.040
(WATER GURGLES)

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
(RUSTLE OF BROOM SWEEPING)

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
(SOFT DRUMBEAT)

42:15.640 --> 42:20.200
(WOMEN KEENING)

42:22.080 --> 42:24.080
(DRUMBEAT CONTINUES)

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
(WAILS)

43:02.560 --> 43:08.280
(MUSIC DROWNS ANGUISHED HOWL)

43:20.640 --> 43:25.000
You have fathomed me for more than
a merchant. Why is that?

43:25.080 --> 43:28.720
Consider that it might be
because I allowed you to.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.360
I've gained more land by the river
to farm and you will go there.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.840
Without Maria. To live and work.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.280
She wishes to stow away in a hold
and she wishes you to help her
do it.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.160
Will you help me?

43:40.240 --> 43:44.880
MARIA: You want to kill Yeardley?
Will your pride let you stay here,

43:44.960 --> 43:47.120
when you know what will become of us?

43:47.200 --> 43:48.800
Pedro?
