black,

07:24.544 --> 07:25.745

<i>and when you start using</i>

a toothpick to the neck today.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.565
- Were you talking shit

41:07.631 --> 41:09.667
about me to Laura?
- I was not. Never.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.836
- It just gets
a little bit confusing.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.104
- Not a fan.
You dropped the ball.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.273
- One of us is definitely
going to the bottom.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.374
- Good job.
