<i>Dan: Look in my eyes.
Casey: No.</i>

01:26:05.431 --> 01:26:08.025
-- <i>Seriously, look in my eyes.</i>
-- <i>Seriously, no.</i>

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.899
-- <i>If you were to look in my eyes,
you know what you'd see?</i> -- <i>Dan...</i>

01:26:10.969 --> 01:26:12.664
you'd see the look of
sheer desperation.

01:26:12.738 --> 01:26:13.967
I am not switching
with you.

01:26:14.039 --> 01:26:16.303
Is it because you don't want
to do the show with Tina?

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:17.638
I have plans.

01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:19.371
Winding down is not plans.

01:26:19.445 --> 01:26:21.140
I'm not just winding down.

01:26:21.213 --> 01:26:23.375
I was thinking
about seeing a movie.

01:26:23.449 --> 01:26:24.610
-- A movie?
-- Yeah.

01:26:24.683 --> 01:26:27.084
I'm gonna miss a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

01:26:27.152 --> 01:26:29.177
tomorrow night
so you can see a movie?

01:26:29.254 --> 01:26:30.949
Well, you want to see
a singer?

01:26:31.023 --> 01:26:33.651
-- Do you know how often Tom
VVaits plays clubs? -- No.

01:26:33.726 --> 01:26:35.057
Tom Waits never plays clubs.

01:26:35.127 --> 01:26:36.788
You know what
he's doing tomorrow night?

01:26:36.862 --> 01:26:37.658
He's playing a club?

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.561
He's playing a club.

01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:39.688
Should I go see him?

01:26:39.765 --> 01:26:41.199
-- Casey...
-- 'Cause I have the night off.

01:26:41.266 --> 01:26:42.597
You can have
my firstborn son,

01:26:42.668 --> 01:26:44.033
just take
tomorrow night's show.

01:26:44.103 --> 01:26:46.299
So I'd have to work tomorrow
and raise your child.

01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:49.102
-- [ Sighs] -- Hey, Elliot, uh,
you got the word on VVebber?

01:26:49.174 --> 01:26:52.144
X-rays came back negative.
They think it's just a sprain.

01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:53.940
I need new clothes.

01:26:54.012 --> 01:26:55.707
-- Do you want me to buy you clothes?
-- No, I'm gonna buy my own clothes.

01:26:55.781 --> 01:26:58.512
-- I just want Natalie to go with me. -- I
offer you the world, and you want clothes?

01:26:58.584 --> 01:27:01.679
Look, this girl named Lillian I just
met said I dress like her father.

01:27:01.754 --> 01:27:03.483
-- You do dress like her father.
-- You know Lillian's father?

01:27:03.555 --> 01:27:05.023
I don't have to know
Lillian's father.

01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:06.683
You're asking me for a favor and
mocking me at the same time?

01:27:06.759 --> 01:27:08.386
I'm sorry.

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.258
Look, Natalie has really
good taste in clothes.

01:27:10.329 --> 01:27:12.229
Last time she went with me,
I found a cool scarf.

01:27:12.297 --> 01:27:13.628
-- So why don't you ask her to go?
-- I did. She --

01:27:13.699 --> 01:27:15.224
It's complicated.
She said no.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.098
So all I have to do is get
Natalie to go shopping with you?

01:27:17.169 --> 01:27:17.863
Yes.

01:27:17.936 --> 01:27:19.335
I could kiss you right now.

01:27:19.404 --> 01:27:20.394
Please don't.

01:27:20.472 --> 01:27:23.203
Chris, let me see
a preview of Seattle on 2.

01:27:23.275 --> 01:27:24.538
Loading Seattle on 2.

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:25.600
Stand by, sound.

01:27:25.677 --> 01:27:27.042
Sound standing by on 3.

01:27:27.112 --> 01:27:28.671
Elliot, is there a final
in Cleveland?

01:27:28.747 --> 01:27:30.681
About a minute left.
Cleveland's up by 4.

01:27:30.749 --> 01:27:32.342
And F.Y.l. --
Miller fouled out.

01:27:32.417 --> 01:27:34.715
When did saying actual words
become such a burden?

01:27:34.787 --> 01:27:35.913
1975.

01:27:35.988 --> 01:27:38.047

-- Jeremy...
-- <i>Yes?</i>

01:27:39.358 --> 01:27:40.917
I'm trying to produce a TV show.
I could use your help.

01:27:40.993 --> 01:27:41.858
TV --
that's another one.

01:27:41.927 --> 01:27:43.725
-- Natalie...
-- Not a chance in hell.

01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:46.265
-- I haven't said anything yet. -- You were
gonna ask me to go clothes shopping with Casey.

01:27:46.331 --> 01:27:47.696
-- <i>How did you know that?</i>
-- <i>I'm intuitive.</i>

01:27:47.766 --> 01:27:48.562
And you were miked.

01:27:48.634 --> 01:27:50.534
-- <i>That too.</i>
-- <i>At some point,</i>

01:27:50.602 --> 01:27:53.196
were you planning on asking me if it's
okay if you switch off nights with Casey?

01:27:53.272 --> 01:27:54.740
I'm still the executive producer
of the show.

01:27:54.807 --> 01:27:57.071
I'm sorry. Is it okay if I
switch off nights with Casey?

01:27:57.142 --> 01:27:59.008
What the hell
do I care?

01:27:59.077 --> 01:28:00.044
Natalie.

01:28:00.112 --> 01:28:02.046
Dan, I'm saying
he's a woman.

01:28:02.114 --> 01:28:04.515
I spent eight hours on
a Saturday watching Casey

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:07.553
try on practically everything
Barney's had to offer -- twice.

01:28:07.619 --> 01:28:08.745
He left with a scarf.

01:28:08.821 --> 01:28:10.619
-- You've seen how he dresses.
-- Yes.

01:28:10.689 --> 01:28:12.680
So this isn't just a favor
to me, then.

01:28:12.758 --> 01:28:15.125
-- You owe this to the world.
-- No.

01:28:15.194 --> 01:28:18.323
Natalie, I love Tom Waits,
probably more than --

01:28:18.397 --> 01:28:19.831
I don't know.

01:28:19.898 --> 01:28:22.299
I just love Tom Waits.

01:28:24.937 --> 01:28:27.269
There's a party tomorrow night
at Lot 61.

01:28:27.339 --> 01:28:28.738
If you get me on the list,
I'll go shopping with Casey.

01:28:28.807 --> 01:28:30.969
[Smooches] You don't know
how much I appreciate this.

01:28:31.043 --> 01:28:32.374
It's an impossible list
to get on.

01:28:32.444 --> 01:28:33.502
I'll make it happen.

01:28:33.579 --> 01:28:34.671
You should know,
in case you're planning

01:28:34.746 --> 01:28:36.339
on using your celebrity
to get me in,

01:28:36.415 --> 01:28:38.315
I already called around
pretending to be you.

01:28:38.383 --> 01:28:40.010
You pretended to be me?

01:28:40.085 --> 01:28:42.019
Mmm, actually, I pretended
to be your secretary

01:28:42.087 --> 01:28:43.680
-- calling on your behalf.
-- My secretary?

01:28:43.755 --> 01:28:45.450
Miss Jean Hodges.
She's very officious.

01:28:45.524 --> 01:28:47.390
-- And they just turned me down flat?
-- Yeah.

01:28:47.459 --> 01:28:48.722
-- Weird.
-- Spooky.

walk with me.

01:28:56.134 --> 01:28:59.126
Look, you still friends with
that bouncer guy at Lot 61?

01:28:59.204 --> 01:29:01.434
Kurt and I
were never exactly friends.

01:29:01.506 --> 01:29:03.167
All right, listen, I really need to
get Natalie in there tomorrow night.

01:29:03.242 --> 01:29:04.869
Is there any way you could
consider calling him?

01:29:04.943 --> 01:29:07.571
If I call Kurt, he's going to think
I want to sleep with him again.

01:29:07.646 --> 01:29:09.307
-- [ Groans] -- Oh, no.
Don't get me wrong.

01:29:09.381 --> 01:29:10.940

-- Yes, sir.
-- Excellent.

Tomorrow at this time,

01:29:26.598 --> 01:29:29.124
in the raspy drawl
of Mr. Tom Waits.

01:29:29.201 --> 01:29:31.636
And not long after that,
I'll be trying on pants.

<i>Dave: 30 seconds live.</i>

01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:35.697

She had to cancel
for tomorrow night.

01:29:38.343 --> 01:29:39.401

to replace her?

You.

01:29:42.514 --> 01:29:45.279

Tom Waits tomorrow.

<i>Maybe someday.</i>

Blaokhawks in Montreal.

“Fine“ -- there's another word that
always sets my toes a-tappin'.

01:32:17.202 --> 01:32:19.967
-- Leave now.
-- Okay.

01:32:20.038 --> 01:32:21.096
<i>Natalie...</i>

01:32:21.173 --> 01:32:23.403
what am I gonna do
with this gun?

01:32:23.475 --> 01:32:24.442
I thought
it was a musket.

01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:26.273
It's a gun,
and I don't want it.

01:32:26.344 --> 01:32:28.438
You see this?

01:32:28.513 --> 01:32:29.446
Yes.

01:32:29.514 --> 01:32:30.481
What's it say?

01:32:30.549 --> 01:32:31.948
"Empire Racquet Club."

01:32:32.017 --> 01:32:33.576
That's the wrong card.

01:32:33.652 --> 01:32:37.145
I am a dues-paying member of
the Anti-handgun Coalition.

01:32:37.222 --> 01:32:39.054
You think they're gonna make you
stop going to the meetings?

01:32:39.124 --> 01:32:41.456
I'm morally opposed
to this.

01:32:41.526 --> 01:32:44.291
VVell, I think as long as you don't
shoot someone with it, you're fine.

01:32:44.362 --> 01:32:46.660
I've got to take this thing and
find some place to smelt it.

01:32:46.731 --> 01:32:48.096
[Laughs]
You're gonna smelt it?

01:32:48.166 --> 01:32:50.134
-- Why are you laughing?
-- <i>It's</i> a funny <i>word.</i>

01:32:50.202 --> 01:32:51.897
-- Don't you have work to do?
-- Yes.

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.768
-- And?
-- Off I go.

01:32:53.839 --> 01:32:55.102
Oh.

01:32:55.173 --> 01:32:57.403
No, hmm.

01:33:00.011 --> 01:33:02.571
Guess who's going
to Lot 61 tonight.

01:33:02.647 --> 01:33:03.739
McGeorge Bundy.

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:05.340
McGeorge Bundy is dead.

01:33:05.417 --> 01:33:07.943
VVell, from the way you asked me, I
figured it was someone unlikely.

01:33:08.019 --> 01:33:09.282
Dan got us on the list.

01:33:09.354 --> 01:33:10.617
Oh, I was also praying

01:33:10.689 --> 01:33:12.953
it would be any two people
other than us.

01:33:13.024 --> 01:33:15.220
-- I knew you'd be this way.
-- I'm not being...any way.

01:33:15.293 --> 01:33:17.694
-- What's wrong -- -- Going to
the hot spot, the cool place?

01:33:17.762 --> 01:33:18.752
-- Yes.
-- Nothing.

01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:20.525
But let me run this
by you.

01:33:20.599 --> 01:33:23.227
After the show, instead
of going to Area 51 --

01:33:23.301 --> 01:33:26.066
Lot 61.
It's a club downtown.

01:33:26.138 --> 01:33:29.108
Fine, fine. How about
instead of going downtown,

01:33:29.174 --> 01:33:32.303
we go home,
order some Chinese food...

01:33:32.377 --> 01:33:34.539
-- And watch Conan?
-- We can watch Kilborn.

01:33:34.613 --> 01:33:36.012
-- I'm very flexible.
-- Jeremy!

01:33:36.081 --> 01:33:37.048
Kilborn's got a great lineup.

01:33:37.115 --> 01:33:39.049
The list was very hard
to get on, Jeremy.

01:33:39.117 --> 01:33:40.710
Dan had to pull
a lot of strings.

01:33:40.785 --> 01:33:42.116
Don't you even want to know
who his guests are?

01:33:42.187 --> 01:33:44.053
Who are his guests?

01:33:44.122 --> 01:33:45.521
I'd have to check
the listings.

01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:46.955
Jeremy,
it's gonna be great!

01:33:47.025 --> 01:33:48.754
Oh, it's not gonna be great,
Natalie.

01:33:48.827 --> 01:33:50.522
We're gonna be in a room
surrounded by people

01:33:50.595 --> 01:33:51.994
for whom "cool"
means "discontent" --

01:33:52.063 --> 01:33:53.258
all of them
trying to be cool,

01:33:53.331 --> 01:33:55.095
which isn't easy while
craning your neck around

01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:57.135
-- <i>to see if you can spot Skeet Ulrich.</i>
-- <i>Jeremy...</i>

01:33:57.202 --> 01:33:59.227
and believe me, there will be half
a dozen people there named Skeet.

01:33:59.304 --> 01:34:01.363
Hey, if you don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

01:34:01.439 --> 01:34:03.533
I'll go.

01:34:03.608 --> 01:34:05.235
-- You don't have to go.
-- I'm happy to go.

01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:07.802
-- But you're not happy to go. -- I'm
not happy to go, but I'll go anyway.

01:34:07.879 --> 01:34:10.644
-- I/Vhy? -- 'Cause I'm tired
of having this fight with you.

01:34:10.715 --> 01:34:13.013
I have to take this to graphics.
Anything else?

01:34:13.084 --> 01:34:16.019
No.

01:34:20.058 --> 01:34:22.117
-- <i>I'm outta</i> here!
-- <i>Don't go.</i>

01:34:22.194 --> 01:34:24.356
-- Casey.
-- Stay a little longer.

01:34:24.429 --> 01:34:25.521
It's my day off.

01:34:25.597 --> 01:34:27.122
It's your day off
'cause I gave it to you.

01:34:27.199 --> 01:34:30.134
No, it's my day off because
you're going scarf shopping,

01:34:30.202 --> 01:34:31.829
and Kim's getting boinked
in a Parkview suite.

01:34:31.903 --> 01:34:33.428
-- Just stay till he gets here.
-- Casey.

01:34:33.505 --> 01:34:35.496
-- I don't like being alone with the guy.
-- He's fine.

01:34:35.574 --> 01:34:37.474
-- Yeah, I know he's fine. Totally fine.
-- So? Good.

01:34:37.542 --> 01:34:39.442
-- He's a little morose,
a little somber. -- Yes.

01:34:39.511 --> 01:34:41.445
Those are adjectives that
wouldn't be entirely out of place

01:34:41.513 --> 01:34:43.379
describing you, there,
Chuckles.

01:34:43.448 --> 01:34:44.938
-- You'll stay?
-- Sure.

01:34:45.016 --> 01:34:45.949
Good.

01:34:46.017 --> 01:34:47.382
Hello.

01:34:47.452 --> 01:34:48.681
Hey, Steve.

01:34:48.753 --> 01:34:50.312
I'm outta here.
You guys have a good show.

01:34:52.123 --> 01:34:54.922
Thank you.

01:34:54.993 --> 01:34:56.085
Hi.

01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:57.424
Am I late?

01:34:57.495 --> 01:34:58.724
-- You're right on time.
-- Good.

01:34:58.797 --> 01:35:00.959
-- Good, I like to be efficient.
-- Yes.

01:35:01.032 --> 01:35:03.729
-- Or prompt is really what I meant to say.
Punctual. -- You're <i>fine.</i>

01:35:03.802 --> 01:35:05.634
Every/thing's fine. Dan got
you started on the script.

01:35:05.704 --> 01:35:07.672
You've got the features
and the dailies.

01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:09.639
Obviously,
we'll fill in the blanks.

01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:12.006
-- Is something wrong? -- Yeah, I think
my girlfriend's breaking up with me.

01:35:12.077 --> 01:35:16.105
<i>-- Huh'? -- My girlfriend, Felicia,
I think she's breaking up with me.</i>

01:35:16.181 --> 01:35:19.378
-- <i>When?</i> -- <i>Right now. Tonight. I think
she's gonna do it when I'm on the air.</i>

01:35:19.451 --> 01:35:23.149
<i>I think I'm gonna get home and find
a note where her stuff used to be.</i>

01:35:24.089 --> 01:35:25.818
[sniffs]

01:35:33.698 --> 01:35:35.564
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

01:35:35.634 --> 01:35:37.830
<i>Casey: Good evening.
From New York City,</i>

01:35:37.902 --> 01:35:40.030
<i>I'm Casey McCall
alongside Steve Sarris</i>

01:35:40.105 --> 01:35:41.664
<i>sitting in for Dan Rydell.</i>

01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:44.266
<i>Those stories, plus
the Chicago Bulls have a cow,</i>

01:35:44.342 --> 01:35:46.276
the Toronto Raptors
show their teeth,

01:35:46.344 --> 01:35:49.006
and the Florida Marlins are
in hook, line, and sinker.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.343
We'll take you to Kentucky

01:35:50.415 --> 01:35:52.440
and show you there's more
than one way to skin a cat,

01:35:52.517 --> 01:35:54.451
and we'll take you to Chicago
where a certain Bear

01:35:54.519 --> 01:35:56.283
has got his hand stuck
in the honey jar --

01:35:56.354 --> 01:35:57.685
all that coming up
after this.

01:35:57.756 --> 01:36:00.384
You're watching
"Sports Night" on CSC,

01:36:00.458 --> 01:36:02.825
and this one's going out
to you, Felicia.

01:36:02.894 --> 01:36:03.952
<i>Dave: Okay.</i>

01:36:04.029 --> 01:36:04.962
We're out, I guess.

01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:06.088
Two minutes back.

01:36:06.164 --> 01:36:07.097
<i>Casey!</i>

01:36:07.165 --> 01:36:08.633
I got it.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:09.826
Steve...

01:36:09.901 --> 01:36:10.925
Yeah.

01:36:11.002 --> 01:36:13.528
We don't generally
do that.

01:36:13.605 --> 01:36:14.970
Do what?

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.371
Um, dedicate a show.

01:36:16.441 --> 01:36:18.205
I'm sorry.

01:36:18.276 --> 01:36:20.404
-- It's no problem. -- It's just
that I got to get her back, Casey.

01:36:20.478 --> 01:36:21.604
-- I understand.
-- I love her.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.671
-- Listen, can you hang on a second?
-- Yeah.

01:36:23.748 --> 01:36:25.648
[Clears throat]

01:36:25.717 --> 01:36:27.913
-- VVhere the hell is she? --
She ran <i>back to</i> her office.

01:36:27.986 --> 01:36:30.455
-- VVell, can you get her to run back in
here? -- Don't you want to sit at your desk?

01:36:30.522 --> 01:36:31.887
Not until
I absolutely have to.

01:36:31.956 --> 01:36:33.481
10 seconds live.

01:36:34.726 --> 01:36:36.524
Okay.

01:36:43.301 --> 01:36:45.429
We commence
with our top story.

01:36:45.503 --> 01:36:46.698
<i>The race
for Lord Stanley's Cup...</i>

01:36:46.771 --> 01:36:47.397
Aah!

01:36:49.808 --> 01:36:53.073
-- What are you doing here?
-- What are you <i>doing</i> here?

01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:56.079
First off, it's <i>my</i> office.
Second off --

01:36:56.147 --> 01:36:59.378
Who cares what second off is?
It's my office.

01:36:59.451 --> 01:37:01.010
We're in the middle
of a show.

01:37:01.086 --> 01:37:02.781
-- Natalie's got the wheel.
-- Ah.

01:37:02.854 --> 01:37:04.481
Yes,
I do that on occasion.

01:37:04.556 --> 01:37:06.718
So don't feel
like 11:00 to midnight

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:09.453
is your special "I can waltz
into Dana's office

01:37:09.527 --> 01:37:11.291
and play
with her gun" time.

01:37:11.363 --> 01:37:12.762
-- My what?
-- Your special --

01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:14.299
-- Shut up.
-- [Laughing]

01:37:14.366 --> 01:37:15.800
What are you doing here?

01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:18.199
-- I heard about Brown Bess.
-- You named my gun?

01:37:18.269 --> 01:37:19.600
It already had a name.

01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:22.333
This is a Brown Bess
second model muskatoon.

01:37:22.407 --> 01:37:23.806
You like guns.

01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:25.843
-- I like <i>this</i> gun.
-- What a shock.

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:27.674
This gun hasn't had
a lot of use.

01:37:27.746 --> 01:37:29.908
Look, you can see here.

01:37:29.981 --> 01:37:31.107
[Clicks]

01:37:31.182 --> 01:37:32.707
The frizzen
is almost pristine.

01:37:32.784 --> 01:37:35.219
Well, I'll keep that in mind
if I ever run across Lafayette.

01:37:35.286 --> 01:37:37.277
Lafayette was on our side,
but I got the joke.

01:37:37.355 --> 01:37:39.653
-- Sam... This is a
European walnut stock,

01:37:39.724 --> 01:37:42.591
and I could be wrong,
but I think this outline

01:37:42.694 --> 01:37:45.288
is the military inspector's
cartouche.

01:37:45.363 --> 01:37:46.728
Guns are disgusting.

01:37:46.798 --> 01:37:48.766
-- You think?
-- Yeah.

01:37:48.833 --> 01:37:50.358
Did you ever hear
the expression,

01:37:50.435 --> 01:37:52.164
"Contempt prior
to investigation"?

01:37:52.237 --> 01:37:53.170
No.

01:37:53.238 --> 01:37:54.501
It's from A.A.

01:37:54.572 --> 01:37:56.131
You should be careful
with that.

01:37:56.207 --> 01:37:57.675
-- I am.
-- Okay.

01:37:57.742 --> 01:37:59.836
Anyway,
I wasn't hitting on you.

01:38:01.179 --> 01:38:02.112
What?

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.011
Isaid...

01:38:03.081 --> 01:38:04.879
I wasn't hitting on you.

01:38:04.949 --> 01:38:07.850
I was just talking
about the musket.

01:38:07.919 --> 01:38:10.081
What in the world...

01:38:10.155 --> 01:38:12.317
would make you think

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.915
-- I-| thought --
-- Just playing safe.

01:38:13.992 --> 01:38:16.927
-- Fine.
-- Okay.

01:38:16.995 --> 01:38:20.590
I have to get back
to the show.

01:38:20.665 --> 01:38:23.032
What did you come
in here for?

01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:24.694
Um...

01:38:24.769 --> 01:38:26.032
Mm, I can't remember.

01:38:26.104 --> 01:38:27.071

-- <i>Thank</i> you.

Who's Felicia Mercer?

01:39:22.427 --> 01:39:24.361
I think she's Steve Sarris'
girlfriend.

<i>Well, could you

01:39:25.997 --> 01:39:27.692

-- Yes.
-- Dana?

01:39:33.104 --> 01:39:35.129

something funny?

<i>I want to work!</i>

01:39:36.508 --> 01:39:38.442
Sam's under the impression
I thought he was hitting on me.

<i>Please go back in there.</i>

01:39:40.612 --> 01:39:42.671
I certainly wasn't asking him to hit on
me, if that's what you were implying.

01:39:42.747 --> 01:39:45.444
-- <i>Dana...</i> -- <i>He likes
guns, so right away</i> --

shaved his mustache.

I'm begging you, please.

01:39:52.991 --> 01:39:53.958
Nope. You know what?

01:39:54.025 --> 01:39:55.789
Not even if he shaved
his mustache.

01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:56.850
Dana...

01:39:56.928 --> 01:39:58.555
And it's not just
the mustache and the guns.

01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.722
You know what I'm saying?

01:39:59.797 --> 01:40:03.631
It's his unquenchable desire
to control everything

01:40:03.701 --> 01:40:05.567

two about unrequited love

Yeah, I'm used to
the lonesome road, Natalie.

I may have had my share of pain
where women are concerned,

01:41:13.638 --> 01:41:14.901
but I'm done with that now.

Uh, yes.

01:41:42.967 --> 01:41:45.129
What?

01:41:45.203 --> 01:41:46.136
Scotch tape.

01:41:46.204 --> 01:41:48.104
Okay.

01:41:48.172 --> 01:41:49.662
Guns kill people, Sam.

01:41:49.741 --> 01:41:51.800
They're macho,
and they're redneck,

01:41:51.876 --> 01:41:53.105
and they're disgusting.

01:41:53.177 --> 01:41:55.339
And frankly,
despite all your faults --

01:41:55.413 --> 01:41:57.643
The world isn't really
like that, Dana.

01:41:57.715 --> 01:41:59.945

-- Than what?
-- Black and white.

01:42:01.586 --> 01:42:03.554
VVell, in this particular case, I
happen to be a dues-paying member of --

01:42:03.621 --> 01:42:06.556

from South Carolina --

unsophisticated --

01:42:08.593 --> 01:42:10.561
but when the king
sent his army

01:42:10.628 --> 01:42:12.494
to terrorize
the colonists --

01:42:12.563 --> 01:42:14.554
who wanted nothing
more glamorous

01:42:14.632 --> 01:42:15.963
than their birthright --

01:42:16.034 --> 01:42:18.833
Marion and
a hundred other farmers...

01:42:18.903 --> 01:42:22.897
fought them off with this.

01:42:22.974 --> 01:42:25.341
They stood up
to the British Empire

01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:27.469
with that crappy
piece of tin.

from Charleston,

Marion wasn't asked
to participate

01:42:50.068 --> 01:42:51.900
in the victory celebration.

01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:54.666

too ragged...

too dirty...

01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:01.970

Maybe we should just...

01:43:13.224 --> 01:43:15.192
keep it where it is?

01:43:19.697 --> 01:43:21.859
Yeah.

Okay.

I gotta get back

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.198
Okay.

01:43:48.126 --> 01:43:51.790
Hey, Natalie, you think before we go I might
have time to get a full body piercing?

01:43:51.863 --> 01:43:53.490
I mean,
I don't want to look weird.

01:43:53.564 --> 01:43:54.622

-- I'm kidding.

01:43:54.699 --> 01:43:56.189
-- I'm very excited to go.
-- Fine.

01:43:56.267 --> 01:43:58.429
What do you suppose all those
people do during the daytime?

-- I <i>don't know.</i> -- <i>They can't all

-- Yeah. -- <i>Let me see</i> a
<i>preview on the LSU film.</i>

01:44:06.978 --> 01:44:08.969
You'd think by now, the people
that work at Tower Records,

01:44:09.046 --> 01:44:11.014
that somebody would tap them
on the shoulder and tell them

01:44:11.082 --> 01:44:13.380
that they aren't actually
rock stars themselves.

01:44:13.451 --> 01:44:14.941

01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:34.905
I said I'd go.
What do you want from me?

01:44:34.972 --> 01:44:38.033
Man, could you do me a few more favors,
Jeremy, I mean, if it's not too much to ask?

01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:40.908
-- I know these aren't your people. --
Yeah, when did they become your people?

01:44:40.978 --> 01:44:43.640
-- They're not my people. --
Then why are we even talking --

01:44:43.714 --> 01:44:45.341
I like lots of different
people, Jeremy!

01:44:45.416 --> 01:44:47.783
I don't know what I like, and I
don't know why it's important

01:44:47.852 --> 01:44:49.286
that I have my mind
made up at 26.

01:44:49.353 --> 01:44:51.378
Now, it's not like
we go out all the time.

01:44:51.455 --> 01:44:52.854
-- We go out a lot.
-- No, we --

01:44:52.924 --> 01:44:54.949
-- We go out a lot! -- VVell,
I want to go out more.

01:44:55.026 --> 01:44:56.289
And I said I'd go,
Natalie.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.452
In fact, I've said it
four times now.

01:44:57.528 --> 01:44:58.654
You're sitting in there
making jokes,

01:44:58.729 --> 01:45:00.356
making me feel like
50 cents worth --

01:45:00.431 --> 01:45:02.058
You know what?
No, hang on a second.

01:45:02.133 --> 01:45:04.101
If you're going to drag my ass
to these places

01:45:04.168 --> 01:45:05.932
-- and insist that I
enjoy it -- -- Don't.

01:45:06.003 --> 01:45:08.199
I make jokes.
That's me having a good time.

01:45:08.272 --> 01:45:10.570
-- At my expense?
-- How is it at your expense?

01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:13.508
Why can't you go to these places
with me and have a good time?

01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:14.977
First of all,
when we go to these places,

01:45:15.046 --> 01:45:17.014
you're having a good time with
everybody in the room but me.

01:45:17.081 --> 01:45:19.345
I'm having a good time with
everybody in the room but you

01:45:19.417 --> 01:45:21.852
'cause you're the only one in
the room not having a good time.

01:45:21.919 --> 01:45:24.513
-- You sit there -- -- I
do my very best, Natalie.

01:45:24.589 --> 01:45:26.114
No, you don't.

01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:28.852
You sit there feeling superior,
only you don't feel superior

01:45:28.926 --> 01:45:31.896
'cause no one in there gives a
damn that you're a sports expert.

01:45:31.963 --> 01:45:35.092
No, actually, in that environment, I do
feel superior for a good many reasons,

01:45:35.166 --> 01:45:37.464
none of which has anything to do
with my sports expertise,

01:45:37.535 --> 01:45:41.438
nor do I feel superior 'cause I got to
walk by two bouncers with a clipboard.

01:45:41.505 --> 01:45:43.974
I don't get the same thrill
you get from being on the list.

01:45:44.041 --> 01:45:46.032
Before we go on,

01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:49.546
could you make a couple more
trashy accusations about me?

01:45:49.614 --> 01:45:51.446
Okay, how about you stop
telling me what a drag I am?

01:45:51.515 --> 01:45:54.348
-- Why are you so mad at me?
-- I'm not mad at you.

01:45:54.418 --> 01:45:56.750
There are things about you
I find unattractive.

01:45:56.821 --> 01:45:58.846
There are things about you
I don't like.

01:45:58.923 --> 01:46:01.722
Well, there are things
about you I don't like.

it goes.
