08:53.033 --> 08:55.275
So I remember my coach hooked me
up with this sports psychologist

08:55.351 --> 08:57.685
who gave me some cool
relaxation techniques.

08:57.763 --> 08:59.371
If you wanna try.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.521
Okay.

09:00.599 --> 09:01.431
-Yeah?
-Yeah, okay.

09:01.616 --> 09:03.357
'Cause my heart is um...
really pounding.

09:03.435 --> 09:05.618
Okay. Um, so, close
your eyes.

09:05.695 --> 09:06.711
Yeah.

09:07.122 --> 09:10.790
Take a deep breath and imagine
yourself on a mountain.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.050
Now, you're about
to start a race

09:12.127 --> 09:13.885
against this big-ass Swiss dude.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.203
Wait. No. Sorry.

09:16.205 --> 09:18.557
Visualize yourself giving
the speech.

09:18.633 --> 09:22.710
Confident, calm, looking
super fly in your business suit

09:22.712 --> 09:25.288
and the crowd is loving it.

09:25.290 --> 09:30.402
They're chanting your name.
Emily! Emily! Emily!

09:30.478 --> 09:32.386
Well, it's a professional
conference

09:32.388 --> 09:34.906
so there's not really
a whole lot of chanting.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.241
No chanting?

09:36.318 --> 09:38.484
-No.
-That's too bad.

09:38.486 --> 09:40.653
Okay. Then just
visualize yourself

09:40.730 --> 09:42.897
absolutely crushing the speech.

09:42.974 --> 09:44.082
Okay.

09:45.827 --> 09:47.335
How's your heart rate?

09:49.756 --> 09:52.757
It is actually better.
[laughs]

09:52.834 --> 09:54.593
You're gonna medal for sure.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.341
Oh, um... remind me.

10:01.343 --> 10:04.418
In my outfit you said
I looked, um...

10:04.496 --> 10:05.328
Super fly.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.397
Super fly.
Right, okay.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.355
♪

10:15.431 --> 10:17.765
[Shred] Okay. Only one
big question left.

10:17.843 --> 10:22.120
Who's going to step up
and be my emergency contact?

10:22.197 --> 10:24.013
Don't you have family
you can ask?

10:24.015 --> 10:26.291
My dad died and my mom
moved to Florida.

10:26.368 --> 10:28.685
But she's got a sweet condo
on the beach

10:28.687 --> 10:31.371
and she says any time I wanna
bring down my emergency contact

10:31.373 --> 10:33.690
for a little sand and sea,
she has a room waiting.

10:33.692 --> 10:36.134
Oh. Well, I hope you and that
guy without boundaries

10:36.211 --> 10:37.861
have fun with your mom.

10:37.863 --> 10:40.880
No! No, no, no, no, no,
no, no!

10:40.957 --> 10:44.458
Guys, who ate one of
my chocolate bars?

10:44.536 --> 10:46.219
There were three
and now there's two.

10:46.221 --> 10:48.054
And they were hidden
way at the back

10:48.131 --> 10:49.463
with my frickin' name on it.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.432
If your name's on it,
that's sacrosanct.

10:51.467 --> 10:52.651
You can look that word up,
Shred.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.634
[whispers] Sacrosanct...

10:53.820 --> 10:55.487
Although I did eat Patel's
ice cream bar.

10:55.563 --> 10:58.823
What? I was saving that
for my end of the week treat!

10:58.900 --> 11:00.383
Oh, you were
intolerable yesterday.

11:00.385 --> 11:01.642
It demanded a response.

11:01.903 --> 11:04.554
Why? Because I said the Mariners
don't have a shot this year?

11:04.556 --> 11:06.406
Say it again and you can kiss
your tuna sandwich goodbye.

11:06.558 --> 11:07.573
The Mariners don't have
a shot this year.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.242
Oh, that tuna sandwich
is gonna taste...

11:09.318 --> 11:10.059
The Mariners
don't have a shot.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.744
The Mariners
don't have a shot...

11:11.746 --> 11:12.729
Okay, I think we're done here.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.231
I need to know who ate
my chocolate bar.

11:15.233 --> 11:16.490
Shred, check the waste
baskets now.

11:16.568 --> 11:17.417
Thanks. Great.

11:17.493 --> 11:18.751
Uh, those chocolate bars
were laced

11:18.828 --> 11:20.845
with high-grade hallucinogenics.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.422
Have you seen double rainbow?

11:22.498 --> 11:24.516
Someone's about to be 10 times
more like that guy

11:24.592 --> 11:25.666
than that guy was.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.977
Hey. Did Emily make it back?

11:29.264 --> 11:30.430
Uh... I'm not sure.

11:30.506 --> 11:31.356
I was gonna give her
a ride

11:31.674 --> 11:33.599
but she ran off after
her presentation.

11:33.752 --> 11:34.726
Um... can this wait?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.362
It's just, we're in the middle
of a bit of a crisis.

11:37.439 --> 11:40.256
It's just weird because
her speech went so well.

11:40.258 --> 11:42.759
She was funny,
talking off the cuff...

11:42.777 --> 11:45.445
she even sang at one point.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.113
Oh God.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.823
Emily ate the chocolate.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.949
All of it?

11:49.951 --> 11:51.459
It looks that way, yeah.

11:52.270 --> 11:53.211
Code red.

11:53.605 --> 11:54.879
My thin mints are missing,
gone without a trace.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.122
She's binging.

11:56.199 --> 11:57.941
Actually, I threw
the cookies out.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.125
You'll thank me later.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.369
Actually, I will not thank you.
I will not thank you, Delores!

12:02.447 --> 12:06.299
I want my own refrigerator.
'Kay?

12:06.375 --> 12:08.393
Delores, I want
my own refrigerator!

12:11.973 --> 12:13.623
So, who's your emergency
contact?

12:13.625 --> 12:14.715
My father.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.626
Aww, I didn't know you were
close with your dad.

12:16.628 --> 12:18.385
We're not.
I hate that son of a bitch.

12:18.463 --> 12:19.796
Then why did you choose him?

12:19.798 --> 12:21.889
Well, if something happens
to me, he's on the hook.

12:21.967 --> 12:22.890
With any luck,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.744
I'll be a vegetable
requiring 24-hour care.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.654
That makes me sad, bro.
My dad was my best friend.

12:28.731 --> 12:29.914
Yeah, of course he was.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.824
My only regret is I never
got to tell him

12:31.826 --> 12:33.084
how much he meant to me.

12:33.161 --> 12:34.660
I mean, he probably knew
because I told him

12:34.737 --> 12:35.587
I loved him every day.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.662
Except when my phone died,

12:36.998 --> 12:38.757
which happened a lot when I was
competing in Europe

12:38.833 --> 12:41.150
'cause I didn't have
the right plugs.

12:41.152 --> 12:43.744
Point is... don't leave
things unsaid.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.305
Call your dad.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.825
You know, they make those
three-in-one adapters.

12:48.827 --> 12:50.584
They have for years.

12:50.586 --> 12:51.561
Really?

12:53.331 --> 12:54.773
Now I have two regrets.

12:54.849 --> 12:57.517
<i>[Dispatch] Truck 12. Pet python</i>
<i> escaped its enclosure.</i>

12:57.593 --> 12:59.426
<i> 7276 South Kenwood.</i>

12:59.504 --> 13:01.854
<i> And get this.</i>
<i> It's JT Wallace's house.</i>

13:01.931 --> 13:03.840
Holy crap. JT Wallace.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.008
Oh, who's that?

13:05.010 --> 13:06.342
Are you serious?

13:06.344 --> 13:08.453
The wide receiver
for the Seahawks?

13:08.530 --> 13:11.272
In what world could I have been
your emergency contact?

13:11.349 --> 13:12.273
Get out.

13:12.534 --> 13:13.792
[Shred] What, really?
We're doing this again?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.502
I'm not... I can't even
look at you.

13:20.950 --> 13:22.425
Don't look at me!

13:25.288 --> 13:26.805
[Victoria] How the hell
are we gonna find her?

13:26.881 --> 13:27.806
I don't know.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.123
It's just like looking
for someone's lost mutt.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.202
Oh, so we put out some beef
strips and stand behind a bush?

13:33.204 --> 13:34.537
I know you're kidding
but do you have beef strips?

13:34.539 --> 13:35.371
Everything I was gonna eat today

13:35.557 --> 13:36.297
got senselessly ripped away
from me.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.317
No. I don't eat gassy foods
on sex days.

13:39.394 --> 13:40.819
Ooh, how's it going
with the yogi by the way?

13:40.895 --> 13:41.969
Do you like him?

13:42.047 --> 13:43.354
As a person?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.156
He's done so much healing

13:45.233 --> 13:47.141
he's healed himself right out of
an actual personality.

13:47.218 --> 13:49.643
But in bed, and I say this
as someone

13:49.721 --> 13:51.996
with a sufficiently large
sample pool,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.665
-Mmmhmm.
-uh, he's detail-oriented.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.224
Hmm.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.668
I used to be detail-oriented.

13:56.744 --> 13:59.153
That was before I was tired
all the time.

13:59.230 --> 14:02.398
Maybe you should try
some of this.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.566
-No.
-I'll give you a little.

14:03.568 --> 14:04.250
No. I can't eat that.

14:04.493 --> 14:05.735
Yes, you can.
Give it a shot.

14:05.737 --> 14:07.403
It makes everything feel amazing

14:07.405 --> 14:08.588
and you're not really doing
anything different.

14:08.664 --> 14:10.014
It's almost like cheating.

14:10.408 --> 14:11.591
My life's not built for that.

14:11.593 --> 14:14.352
Every night I'm taking a kid
to the ER.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.412
Or talking another one down
from a nightmare.

14:16.414 --> 14:18.339
Last night it was
global warming.

14:18.341 --> 14:21.008
I can't discuss polar ice caps
all high and horny.

14:21.086 --> 14:23.361
Oh, my God.
Is that Emily?

14:23.438 --> 14:25.346
[cheering]

14:25.423 --> 14:31.327
[chanting]
Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily!

14:36.935 --> 14:38.418
Even Seahawk colors.

14:41.364 --> 14:42.605
Sheesh. You almost beat me.

14:42.607 --> 14:44.549
Yeah. Asher knows
all the shortcuts.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.276
Hey, good luck
with your girlfriend, buddy.

14:47.278 --> 14:48.887
I sincerely hope everything
works out.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.597
[Girlfriend] Thank God
you're here. Hurry!

14:53.635 --> 14:54.726
He was cleaning the cage.

14:55.803 --> 14:57.395
Holy crap.

14:57.472 --> 14:58.563
It's huge.

14:59.048 --> 14:59.898
Frank, have you ever dealt with
something like this before?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.457
No. And I can't tell you
how much,

15:01.459 --> 15:03.550
but something that's not nothing
just slipped out of me

15:03.628 --> 15:04.794
and into my underwear.

15:04.796 --> 15:06.387
It's getting tighter.

15:06.464 --> 15:08.389
Just remain calm, we're gonna
unwind it from you.

15:08.391 --> 15:09.799
Shred, grab the head.

15:09.801 --> 15:12.226
I'm not grabbing the head, man.
It's scary and gross.

15:12.228 --> 15:14.061
The Seahawks have a very shallow
depth chart,

15:14.139 --> 15:14.895
now grab the head.

15:14.973 --> 15:15.972
I'm not touching that thing.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.974
I was led to believe
this job was mostly dogs.

15:17.976 --> 15:18.991
Help him!

15:19.252 --> 15:21.661
This thing is super strong.
Grab something, Shred.

15:21.737 --> 15:23.329
Okay. But I'm closing my eyes.

15:23.406 --> 15:25.572
Is this a bad time to tell you
that I'm a big fan?

15:25.574 --> 15:26.649
[JT] Yes.

15:26.651 --> 15:28.484
Okay. Well, it would just
seem phony

15:28.486 --> 15:29.910
if I didn't say anything, right?

15:29.988 --> 15:31.763
Listen, man, you get
this thing off me,

15:31.765 --> 15:32.764
I'll sign anything you want.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.432
Really? How about a football?

15:34.509 --> 15:35.600
-Yes.
-How about a jersey?

15:35.677 --> 15:36.342
-Yes.
-A helmet?

15:36.344 --> 15:37.435
Yes.

15:37.829 --> 15:39.328
What about one of those
breast cancer awareness hats-

15:39.330 --> 15:40.846
-Anything!
-That are collectible.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.440
[gasps]

15:43.276 --> 15:45.485
Yeah. I thought I was gonna die.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.188
[groaning]
Okay, yeah, yeah...

15:49.265 --> 15:52.433
Oh, my God.
It's on me now.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.078
If I don't make it...
beat the Rams.

15:58.941 --> 15:59.773
[Victoria] Oh, my god.

16:00.018 --> 16:02.535
Emily! Hey!
How's it going, girl?

16:02.537 --> 16:04.295
Oh, man. You are really good
out there.

16:04.372 --> 16:05.521
What'd you play
in high school?

16:05.523 --> 16:07.448
-Yeah.
-What are you guys doing here?

16:07.525 --> 16:08.691
Uh, we, we just, uh...

16:08.693 --> 16:10.710
we just came to take you back
to the office.

16:10.828 --> 16:11.803
To the office.

16:11.879 --> 16:16.365
Oh. No. I'm not going back.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.884
Yeah. I'm...
I'm never going back.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.478
Bye!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.146
Oh, I hate running.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.390
-Emily! Emily!
-Emily!!

16:24.392 --> 16:25.316
My god, she's out of control.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.151
[Patel] Hello! Emily! Slow down!
Stop guys!

16:27.186 --> 16:27.968
Guys, guys, stop her!

16:28.137 --> 16:29.970
Whoo!
My whole body's buzzing.

16:29.972 --> 16:31.564
I've never felt more alive!

16:31.640 --> 16:33.549
Dude, that snake had plans
for you.

16:33.551 --> 16:34.550
A brush with death

16:34.810 --> 16:37.144
and an encounter with
a world-class athlete.

16:37.222 --> 16:39.330
Okay. That's obviously
a little bit hurtful.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.558
I came in 7th at Pyeongchang
but I know it's a niche sport.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.578
Listen, don't get needy but
you were pretty good back there.

16:45.580 --> 16:46.337
Really?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.338
You're already being needy.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.656
I won't say another word.
Except that after this,

16:49.734 --> 16:52.585
I can't imagine being in battle
with anyone else.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.178
Snake brothers forever!

16:54.255 --> 16:56.055
Oh, 100 percent did this
to myself.

16:57.075 --> 16:57.998
-Again?
-Give me those forms.

16:58.259 --> 17:00.760
-What? What did I do?
-Give me those forms.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.354
-You'll be my emergency contact?
-Give them to me.

17:03.431 --> 17:06.932
Don't get hurt 'cause I'm
pulling the plug for anything.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.276
Ooooh!

17:09.863 --> 17:10.844
Alright!

17:10.846 --> 17:11.529
Whoo!

17:11.606 --> 17:12.530
Whoo!

17:12.924 --> 17:15.424
[Emily] I'm finally coming out
of my cocoon!

17:15.426 --> 17:16.701
[Victoria] You're high on drugs!

17:16.778 --> 17:19.111
No, I'm high on life!

17:19.188 --> 17:21.688
[Victoria] Life can't do that,
that's why we have drugs.

17:21.766 --> 17:22.856
-[Emily] Ah!
-[Victoria] Yes!

17:22.934 --> 17:24.450
[Victoria] No, No.

17:24.568 --> 17:25.501
Oh, here we go.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.438
I mean, I went to Vienna once

17:29.698 --> 17:32.441
but I mostly just stayed
in the hotel.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.385
Like, what was I afraid of?

17:34.462 --> 17:37.388
Mmhmm.
I can't do this anymore.

17:37.465 --> 17:39.891
I am afraid of so many things.

17:39.967 --> 17:40.449
What does that mean?

17:40.451 --> 17:40.950
You can go.

17:41.061 --> 17:41.801
This is my fault anyway

17:42.228 --> 17:42.876
and I've done this, like,
a hundred times.

17:43.546 --> 17:47.899
Listen, if you need anything,
anything at all,

17:47.975 --> 17:49.400
just don't call me.

17:50.295 --> 17:51.235
Bye Emily.

17:51.312 --> 17:54.721
Oh, bye- whoa, you have
gorgeous teeth.

17:54.723 --> 17:58.301
[laughing]
Thank you. Okay.

17:58.303 --> 18:03.581
Wait. Did you know I can name
every country in South America?

18:03.658 --> 18:04.582
No, I didn't.

18:04.659 --> 18:07.418
-Okay. Um, I can.
-Okay.

18:07.495 --> 18:08.735
-Venezuela.
-Yeah.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.088
-Ecuador.
-I deserve this.

18:10.164 --> 18:11.572
Colombia, Paraguay.

18:11.649 --> 18:12.965
[knocking]

18:17.155 --> 18:19.097
Oh, look what the cat
dragged in.

18:19.173 --> 18:21.415
It's nice to see you
too, Dad.

18:21.492 --> 18:25.010
Look, um... I had a near-death
experience today

18:25.087 --> 18:29.756
and, I don't know, I don't wanna
die with things left unsaid.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.500
I'm listening.

18:31.502 --> 18:32.868
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know

18:32.870 --> 18:34.353
that you're a terrible father

18:34.355 --> 18:38.074
who never had my back and
I want you to rot in hell.

18:42.347 --> 18:45.681
So that's it.
Those are the two items.

18:45.683 --> 18:47.516
Well look, uh...
you came this far,

18:47.518 --> 18:49.776
at least come in
and have a beer.

18:49.854 --> 18:50.853
Did you just hear what I said?

18:51.113 --> 18:54.707
Yeah. Bad father and, uh...
the rotting thing.

18:54.783 --> 18:56.384
You want a beer or not?

18:57.620 --> 18:58.861
What kind you got?

18:59.197 --> 19:02.456
Rainier. I've been drinking
the same beer since I was 12.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.367
You too good for Rainier now?

19:04.369 --> 19:06.811
I've always been too good
for Rainier.

19:06.888 --> 19:08.295
What are you, like, 100 now?

19:09.040 --> 19:11.965
French Guyana.
Regular Guyana. Chile.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.225
[knocking on door]

19:13.302 --> 19:14.043
Argentina.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.135
Hang on,
I have to get that.

19:15.213 --> 19:15.969
Wait. No, please don't
leave me.

19:16.230 --> 19:17.321
No, you'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

19:17.473 --> 19:18.472
Eat your cereal.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.533
Sorry, I don't have any milk.
I know it's dry.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.718
Hi.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.644
I'm so happy to see you.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.054
Yeah, you too.

19:25.056 --> 19:25.938
As a tantric exercise

19:26.166 --> 19:28.166
I've abstained from sex
for three months.

19:28.242 --> 19:31.410
I intend to focus all that
stored-up energy on you.

19:31.487 --> 19:34.246
[Emily] Suriname!
I forgot Suriname.

19:34.323 --> 19:35.506
-Uh...
-Who's that?

19:35.583 --> 19:38.567
Is she going to participate
or... just watch?

19:38.569 --> 19:40.236
No. There was an office fridge
mix up

19:40.238 --> 19:42.238
and now she's in
another dimension.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.090
Uh... I'm gonna have to stay
here and take care of her.

19:45.167 --> 19:49.187
But when she comes down
I could text you.

19:49.263 --> 19:51.430
Three months is
a really long time

19:51.507 --> 19:54.266
and I have a few other friends
in Seattle.

19:54.419 --> 19:56.027
But I'll be back in August.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.844
Bye Victoria.

19:57.846 --> 19:59.488
'Kay. Bye. Cool.

20:01.183 --> 20:03.826
-Can I tell you something?
-Yeah. Of course.

20:04.445 --> 20:05.594
I only got my job

20:05.854 --> 20:09.373
because of connections
in the mayor's office, so...

20:09.375 --> 20:12.284
I don't deserve it,
I'm a fraud.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.286
That's not true.
That's the drugs talking.

20:14.363 --> 20:16.288
Everyone thinks you're great.

20:16.365 --> 20:19.550
-Really?
-Yeah. You're great.

20:19.627 --> 20:20.718
You're my best friend.

20:20.795 --> 20:23.721
Oh, okay.
That's... that's really nice.

20:23.798 --> 20:24.722
[phone ringing]

20:24.799 --> 20:25.556
Hang on.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.207
Hello?

20:27.285 --> 20:28.117
Oh, you were right.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.469
These chocolates
are a game-changer.

20:30.546 --> 20:32.471
Maya called her mom,
she picked up the kids,

20:32.473 --> 20:34.473
we got the whole night
to ourselves.

20:34.475 --> 20:37.643
Wait. Are you seriously
calling me post sex?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.754
Yeah, post.
Pre. Pre-pre.

20:39.756 --> 20:40.646
You never know.

20:40.965 --> 20:42.556
Oh, Victoria, you're gonna need
to hold me.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.700
I'm starting to panic
about climate change.

20:45.970 --> 20:49.321
Oh, my God.
We ate the fortune cookies.

20:49.398 --> 20:51.974
Oh, and they were
mighty delicious.

20:51.993 --> 20:53.751
