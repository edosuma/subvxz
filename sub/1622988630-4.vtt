The roll of the ball, sound of a strike.

00:06.465 --> 00:09.343
And this year's prize,
dinner for two at Harryhausen's.

00:09.426 --> 00:13.347
No Bowl-off-a-thon for you, Wazowski.

00:13.430 --> 00:18.352
Oh, hello, Roze.
Now, what's this about me not bowling?

00:18.435 --> 00:21.522
You've still got to do your paperwork.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.565
"Paperwork"? (CHUCKLES) No. How common.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.568
I'm in charge now.
You know, the SCPOMICE-VDADOCREM.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.570
Fungus files my paperwork.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.241
Not file. Approve.

00:32.324 --> 00:38.038
Now that you're in charge,
you have to approve all the paperwork.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.166
You sure you're not Roz?

00:41.250 --> 00:44.670
We're completely different.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.130

00:47.214 --> 00:48.882
-Gary.
-Mikey.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.468
Roze, uh, I just wanna say I'm so sorry.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.637
I wasn't able to finish up
my paperwork last night.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.265
I was busy practicing
for the big Bowl-off-a-thon,

00:56.348 --> 00:59.476
so that I could, uh, win again. (LAUGHS)

00:59.560 --> 01:03.313
Don't you worry
that cute little round head of yours.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.982
It's just paperwork.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.527
-Oh, Roze, you are the best.
-No, you're the best.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.612
-Oh!
-Good luck, Gary.

had a bowling alley.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.693
-You like bowling?
-Not really.

Ugh, what are you reading?

I gotta get in good with the boss.

Oh, hiya, guys.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.916
TYLOR: How did you
get stuck in the ball return?

02:03.999 --> 02:05.501
Bowling, it's in my blood.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.921
I say to myself,
"Mike, you're the ball. Be the ball."

02:09.004 --> 02:10.547
So, I was the ball.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.300
Getting ready for the big Bowl-off-a-thon,
huh, Mr. Wazowski?

02:13.383 --> 02:15.761
Well, sadly, no Bowl-off-a-thon
for me this year.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.222
Too busy on the Laugh Floor
approving paperwork.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.392
Oh, how I would have loved to have taken
my sweet schmoopsie-poo to Harryhausen's.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.938
Hey. I thought Harryhausen's banned
your green butt for life. (CHUCKLES)

02:26.021 --> 02:28.398
No. With great power
comes great privileges.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.610
And now that I'm SCPOMICE-VDADOCREM,
the ban on my butt has been lifted.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.572
Well, Mr. Scabamat-old-daddy-crumb,
you're lucky you're not playin'.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.618
Spare you the humiliation
of losing to me again.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.703
(LAUGHS) "Spare." Oh, man.

02:41.787 --> 02:45.624
Ha! Well, I may not have time
to play, but I'm, uh...

02:46.959 --> 02:48.252
I'm sponsoring a team.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.379
And they're a great team. Yeah.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.422
So they're gonna bowl you away. Ha!

02:52.506 --> 02:55.509

they don't strike out.

What team? I don't have a team.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.359
Now I need a team.
A team that can beat Gary.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.696
If I only knew where I could find
some top-notch bowlers.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.991
Do I know bowlers? Yes, I know bowlers!

03:19.074 --> 03:21.493
They don't call me "No Splitz Fritz"
for nothing.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.953
They... They call you that?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.329
For nothing.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.623
-I've never heard them call you that.
-Well, they do.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.210
And we've got Pin-Pal Val over there
and No-Gutter Cutter.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.089
Hmm, Duncan doesn't play,
but he loves the snachos.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.008
Huh. Well, that is great news.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.136
-The snachos?
-No. That you guys play. That's... Wow!

03:39.219 --> 03:42.055
Have you ever thought
about forming a team?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.182
A bowling team?

03:43.265 --> 03:48.270
Yeah, sure. And maybe, I don't know,
uh, entering the, uh, Bowl-off-a-thon?

03:48.896 --> 03:52.191
Form a team. The Bowl-off-a-thon.

-Yeah, you're falling in love with us.

-I am doing that.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.327
I'm doing what you said.
I am in love, yes.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.121
Yeah, you could be the team captain.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.916
Totally. Yeah.
A chance for me to bond with you guys.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.042

that I also have.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.504
-Extended family.
-Work friends?

04:13.587 --> 04:16.048
How about the
"weird family that lives next door,

04:16.131 --> 04:18.175
but you tell them
when you're going on vacation,

04:18.258 --> 04:19.968

tremendously good? How good?

They're the best.
They've been bowling for years.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
-I think they're like champions.
-Really? Great.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.941
They've got nicknames.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.442
We're gonna need a team name.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.737
Maybe the Gutter Busters.
Or the Alley Laughs?

04:38.820 --> 04:41.573
How about, The Big Wazowskis?

04:41.657 --> 04:43.283
"The Big Wazowskis"?

04:43.367 --> 04:47.454
That sounds like something
I've always wanted in a team name!

04:47.538 --> 04:48.956

05:03.679 --> 05:05.931
-and there he was.
-You go ahead. I'll be right there.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.349
-Eh...
-Can you believe it?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.476

stuck in the ball return.

And I'm not talking about these feet.
I'm talking about your defeat.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.612
Really?

05:20.696 --> 05:23.866
Yeah. I got a dream team, dude.
And it's your worst nightmare.

05:23.949 --> 05:27.119

05:27.202 --> 05:29.246
Yeah. Yes, it's so. It's so, Gary.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.540
In fact, it's so so,
I say we make it interesting.

There's a difference.

because he wants to bond with us.

slash desperate attempt

so he'll make you a jokester.

but only if you come through.

Oh, yeah, well,
don't worry, Mike. We will.

for whatever reason we don't--

at Harryhausen's.

and be his butler for a month.

(IN DEEP VOICE) I'm not Duncan.

Okay, that's fine. Whatever voice.

Hey, Duncan.
You done with your "secert room"?

Great. And... But just... Sorry.
What do you get out of it?

12:16.695 --> 12:19.198
DUNCAN: Just want you
to sign a little contract.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.117
We'll call it a written agreement.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.328
That's literally what a contract is.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.038
An agreement that stipulates

12:26.121 --> 12:27.873
that you will not in any way hereto now,

12:27.956 --> 12:31.835

I do not care about Fritz's job.
I don't want the job.

But now it's legally binding.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.385
Cool. Fine. Just stop with the voice.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.555
Whatever. I'll sign it.
Just get me the bowlers, okay?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.766
There.

Some sort of weird cancel thing.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.381
Says it right there in cancel font.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.675
Cancel font. I've seen it before.
I know it well.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.218
That looks like your handwriting.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.720
Hey! Uh, everybody did great.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.099
In fact, you guys should go
into town for lunch.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.812
Into town over...
You should go there, not be here.

-Oh, aren't you gonna come?
-Me?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.274
FRITZ: You're the team captain.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.359
Somebody's gotta hold down the fort.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.319
And I'm pooped.
You guys go. You deserve it.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.696
You are so selfless.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.782
Is he not selfless?
Always thinking about others.

That's me.

The team. Right. Yes. There was, uh...

You're not gonna say "problem"?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.311
-Problem?
-Tylor?

14:12.394 --> 14:15.230
Don't worry. The replacements
should be here any...

14:31.747 --> 14:34.041

14:34.625 --> 14:36.710
Or don't. (CHUCKLES) You know what I mean.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.794
Break a leg.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.963
'Cause if you don't,
they'll do it for you.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.426
How we doing, everybody? Uh, I am Tylor.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.512
I'm your captain,
so let's get on out there

14:46.595 --> 14:48.013
and let's be the winning...

14:49.848 --> 14:50.849
team.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.065
(CHUCKLES)

14:59.233 --> 15:00.609
You lied to us.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.194
No. Val, no.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.030
They un-cancelled the cancel.

15:05.113 --> 15:08.534
You guys weren't around
and I needed some players, so I...

15:14.748 --> 15:19.211
I lied,
but uh, I was just thinking of you guys.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.255
Didn't want you all to get hurt.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.131
When you lose the game.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.550
How hurt you would all be.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.845
This hurts way more, Tylor.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.640
MIKE: Hey, Tylor? Tylor? What's going on?

15:31.723 --> 15:33.267
We've got more players than we need.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.937
No, you don't.
Me and the boys, we took a vote.

15:37.020 --> 15:41.358
And we do not want to play
for a captain that betrays his team.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.360
Gentlemen, shall we?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.988
No. Don't. No. Wait, please. Wait.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.990
Now what? What's the plan, Tylor?

15:48.073 --> 15:50.242

15:57.249 --> 16:00.419
(SIGHS) Sorry, Mike. I just...

16:01.253 --> 16:03.422
I just wanted to impress you.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.300
And all I really ended up doing was...

16:06.383 --> 16:07.801
(SIGHS)

16:07.885 --> 16:09.636
was hurting my team.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.931
I really let you guys down, and I'm sorry.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.349

16:15.184 --> 16:18.061
I guess I have to forfeit.

Whoa, looks like
the Big Wazowskis forfeit,

16:24.276 --> 16:26.028
which means the winner is--

16:26.111 --> 16:27.237
FRITZ: Wait!

16:28.405 --> 16:29.573
Huh?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.867
You said "team." You're right.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.286
We are the Monsters Inc. Facilities Team.

16:34.369 --> 16:37.539
And when you're part of a team,
you stand up for your teammates.

16:37.623 --> 16:38.999
And regardless of what they do,

16:39.082 --> 16:42.002
unless it's illegal and would make you
an accomplice to a crime,

16:42.085 --> 16:43.670
which I have learned the hard way,

16:43.754 --> 16:46.840
you remain loyal. By their side.

Well, you know, through the...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.595
-Good and the bad?
-The good in the bag

16:51.678 --> 16:55.140
because you know
they would do the same for you.

16:55.224 --> 16:58.727
So, Tylor,
I have a question for you, young MIFTer.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.897
Are you part of our team?

17:03.065 --> 17:08.362
Well, I'm more than part of the team.
I'm the team captain.

17:08.445 --> 17:12.407
And you know what?
I will lead us to victory.

17:12.491 --> 17:16.078
Because we are MIFT.
We are the Big Wazowskis.

17:16.161 --> 17:19.206
But, Tylor, can I remind you
that we pee-ew stink?

17:19.289 --> 17:22.918
Well, then, we're just gonna have to
stink our way to victory.

Yeah, okay. But, uh, who gets
the dinner for two at Harryhausen's?

for the terrible teri-yucky.
