09:40.780 --> 09:42.882
- TIMMY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.784
WHAT AM I DOING
IN THE CROCKER CAVE?

09:44.850 --> 09:46.385
AND WHY DO I FEEL
LIKE I'VE BEEN

09:46.452 --> 09:48.621
UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN
FOR TOO LONG?

09:48.688 --> 09:51.624
- I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
JUST UNTIE COSMO AND WANDA.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.895
GUYS, POOF US OUT OF HERE
BEFORE MR. CROCKER WAKES UP.

09:55.962 --> 09:59.131
- YOU GOT IT, UH, SPORT.
- TIMMY!

09:59.198 --> 10:02.835
- I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.771
- AH! THE HUMANITY!
OH, FAINT.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.908
[sighs]
AY!

10:08.975 --> 10:13.846
- I HAD THE WORST NIGHTMARE.
YOU WERE THERE AND TOMMY.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.047
- TIMMY!

10:15.114 --> 10:16.549
- YOU SHOULD WRITE
THAT DOWN, BRENDA.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.050
- OKAY, GUYS,
TO KEEP MR. CROCKER

10:18.117 --> 10:19.318
FROM ACTIVATING SPARKY AGAIN,

10:19.385 --> 10:21.687
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT
HIS MICROCHIP.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.222
I THINK I GOT IT.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.224
NO, THAT'S A POTATO CHIP.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.993
MM, POKER CHIP.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.961
BASKET OF FISH AND CHIPS.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.496
I GOT IT!
THE MICROCHIP!

10:30.563 --> 10:32.631
I WISH THIS THING
WAS GONE FOREVER.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.304
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE
THE THREE OF YOU BACK,

10:38.371 --> 10:41.440
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
A LITTLE BAD FOR MR. CROCKER.

10:41.507 --> 10:44.176
HOW ABOUT WE POOF HIM UP
THE MAGIC SET HE ALWAYS WANTED?

10:48.848 --> 10:51.150
- THE MAGIC SET
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED!

10:51.217 --> 10:53.619
FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO
IS SAW MOTHER IN HALF.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.188
THEN I'M GOING TO DO A TRICK
FROM THE MAGIC SET.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.723
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

10:57.790 --> 11:00.626
MY OBSESSION WITH FAIRIES
HAS ONCE AGAIN RUINED MY LIFE.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.194
- HELLO, DENZEL.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.864
I'M STILL SINGLE 'CAUSE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.799
ALSO, I HAVE
A RARE GENETIC CONDITION

11:06.866 --> 11:08.567
THAT PREVENTS ME FROM AGING.

11:08.634 --> 11:11.637
- AMAZING! WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET YOU BACK?

11:11.704 --> 11:14.073
- JUST GIVE UP YOUR SILLY
OBSESSION WITH FAIRIES,

11:14.140 --> 11:16.142
AND I'M ALL YOURS.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.377
- GET LOST, POSEUR!

11:18.444 --> 11:21.313
- [screams]
IT'S DARK DOWN HERE.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.217
- AS LONG AS LAZLO, BRENDA, AND
THE UNNAMED DOG ARE OUT THERE,

11:25.284 --> 11:26.719
I'LL NEVER QUIT!

11:26.786 --> 11:29.221
BUT FIRST, I'M GONNA PLAY
WITH MY MAGIC HAT.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.257
- [roars]

11:31.323 --> 11:33.426
- GAH! WHY?

11:33.492 --> 11:35.928
all:
UNDERPANTS!

11:51.510 --> 11:53.813
- TIMMY, WHY ARE WE
AT THE LOONY BIN?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.815
- THIS ISN'T
THE LOONEY BIN, SPARKY.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.183
IT'S THE RETIREMENT HOME

11:57.249 --> 11:59.985
FOR ACTORS WHO PLAYED
SUPERHEROES ON TV.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.222
THEY CALL IT
THE HOME OF JUSTICE...

12:03.289 --> 12:05.658
JUSTICE, JUSTICE.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.027
ANYWAY, WE'RE HERE
TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTHDAY

12:08.094 --> 12:12.031
OF THE GREATEST TV SUPERHERO
OF ALL TIME--CATMAN!

12:12.098 --> 12:13.532
[cat screeches]

12:13.599 --> 12:16.268
- AND I'M HERE TO MEET
ALL MY FAVORITE TV SUPERHEROES.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.770
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE
WHO MADE IT COOL

12:17.837 --> 12:19.705
TO WEAR UNDERWEAR
OVER YOUR PANTS.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.942
- YOU SURE IT'S SAFE FOR YOU
GUYS TO BE IN FAIRY FORM HERE?

12:26.512 --> 12:28.080
NEVER MIND. YOU'RE GOOD.
- OOH!

12:28.147 --> 12:32.685
I THINK I SEE BUTTERFLY BOY.
I GOT TO GET HIS AUTOGRAPH.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.055
- I DON'T REMEMBER HIS SHOW.
- YEAH, HE NEVER HAD A SHOW.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.757
HE'S JUST A MAD MAN
WHO DRESSES UP LIKE A BUTTERFLY.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.526
- [laughs]

12:40.593 --> 12:43.896
- WE'LL GO GET BUTTERFLY BOY'S
AUTOGRAPH AND SEE YOU AT HOME.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.132
- NOW TO FIND CATMAN'S ROOM.

12:46.198 --> 12:50.202
- NURSE, THE LITTER BOX
IN MY HERO LAIR NEEDS CHANGING!

12:50.269 --> 12:52.771
- FOUND HIM.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.907
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CATMAN.

13:02.715 --> 13:03.949
- HI, TIMMY.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.986
I WAS JUST SHARPENING
MY CLAWS OF JUSTICE.

13:07.052 --> 13:11.090
I NEVER KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM EVIL...

13:11.157 --> 13:13.292
OR OPEN A CAN OF TUNA.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.995
- RIGHT. WELL, I BROUGHT YOU
A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

13:16.061 --> 13:19.331
- YAY.
THANK YOU, CITIZEN!

13:19.398 --> 13:21.367
HOLY OFFICE SUPPLIES!

13:21.433 --> 13:24.203
IT'S MY ARCHNEMESIS,
HOUSEHOLD TAPE!

13:24.270 --> 13:26.372
MEOW.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.641
OFF...TAPE...NOW.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.076
[grunting]

13:31.143 --> 13:32.811
[crash]
MY TAIL.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.981
- HEY, TIMMY, I SCORED
A FREE LUNCH IN THE CAFETERIA.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.984
THEY'RE SERVING SALISBURY STEAK
AND TEETH IN A GLASS.

13:39.051 --> 13:42.521
- STAND BACK, TIMMY.
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER.

13:42.588 --> 13:46.091
- UH, NO, IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S JUST MY DOG SPARKY.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.127
- YOU'VE BEEN
BRAINWASHED, TIMMY.

13:48.194 --> 13:53.165
THAT FIEND IS
MY OTHER ARCHNEMESIS, DOGMAN!

13:53.232 --> 13:57.169
HE'S USED YOU TO LOCATE MY LAIR
SO HE CAN DESTROY ME.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.306
HE'S PROBABLY BEEN WORKING
WITH HOUSEHOLD TAPE

14:00.372 --> 14:01.774
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.510
- I THINK SOMEONE NEEDS TO UP
HIS MEDICINE OF JUSTICE.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.645
- CATMAN,
DOGMAN ISN'T REAL.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.381
HE'S A VILLAIN
FROM THE <i> CATMAN</i> TV SERIES.

14:09.448 --> 14:13.719
- AND I SWORE WITH EVERY FIBER
OF MY SANDPAPERY TONGUE

14:13.786 --> 14:16.989
THAT ONE DAY,
I'D THROW HIM BEHIND BARS.

14:17.056 --> 14:21.327
PREPARE TO BE BOW-WOWED
BY MY CRIME-FIGHTING SKILLS,

14:21.393 --> 14:22.995
YOU CANINE CRIMINAL!

14:23.062 --> 14:25.297
OH, NO,
THE TAPE IS BACK!

14:25.364 --> 14:27.299
THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER!

14:27.366 --> 14:30.135
STUMBLE! FALL!
OH, AH.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.305
I'M SAFE IN HERE.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.674
- BUTTERFLY BOY'S
GOT TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

14:35.741 --> 14:39.011
- TAKE THAT, EVILDOERS!

14:39.078 --> 14:42.248
- OH, NO!
BUTTERFLY BOY'S CAPTURED US!

14:42.314 --> 14:43.249
- YAY!

14:43.315 --> 14:44.883
NO, WAIT. BOO!

14:44.950 --> 14:48.721
- NO ONE CAN ESCAPE
MY NET OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

14:48.787 --> 14:53.058
ALSO, NO ONE CAN ESCAPE LOOKING
AT PICTURES OF MY GRANDKIDS.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.562
AND I JUST GOT
THE TWINS' BAR MITZVAH PHOTOS!

14:56.629 --> 14:59.098
both:
NO!

14:59.164 --> 15:01.734
- YOU KNOW,
I LOVE ME SOME CATMAN,

15:01.800 --> 15:03.636
BUT THANK GOODNESS
WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE HIM

15:03.702 --> 15:05.604
FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.173
- THERE'S THE DOG FIEND NOW.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.410
I'LL LURE HIM OUT WITH
MY SQUIRREL PUPPET, MR. NUTS,

15:11.477 --> 15:14.580
THEN ZAP HIM
WITH MY TRUSTY CAT-A-PROD.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.981
MEOW.

15:16.048 --> 15:19.752
NOW TO PERFORM SOME
HYPERREALISTIC RODENT NOISES

15:19.818 --> 15:22.121
WITH MY SUPERHERO
VOCAL CORDS.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.791
SQUIRREL NOISE, CHEWING NUTS,
SQUEAK, SQUEAK.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.060
- SQUIRREL!
I'D LOVE TO CHASE YOU,

15:28.127 --> 15:30.195
BUT YOU'RE ATTACHED
TO A WACKO'S WRIST.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.465
- SOMEONE'S TAUGHT THAT OLD DOG
SOME NEW TRICKS.

15:33.532 --> 15:36.101
I WON'T GIVE UP
TILL I'VE CAPTURED HIM

15:36.168 --> 15:37.903
AND TIMMY'S SAFE.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.240
GEE, IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.574
[siren blaring]

15:42.641 --> 15:44.543
- THANK YOU,
HANDSOME FIREMAN.

15:44.610 --> 15:50.049
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO GO
BACK UP THAT TREE FOR MR. NUTS.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.951
PLAN "B"--
I'LL LURE HIM AWAY FROM TIMMY

15:53.018 --> 15:55.654
WITH THE ONE THING
DOGS CAN'T RESIST,

15:55.721 --> 15:58.924
EXTRA-CHUNKY
ORGANIC PEANUT BUTTER.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.066
- OOH, PEANUT BUTTER.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.668
THIS BETTER BE EXTRA-CHUNKY
AND ORGANIC.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.173
[grunts]

16:14.239 --> 16:17.576
- NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE CAT CAVE FOR QUESTIONING,

16:17.643 --> 16:20.245
ONCE THAT HANDSOME FIREMAN
GETS HERE.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.816
SO...

16:23.882 --> 16:26.452
CRAZY WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING, HUH?

16:30.522 --> 16:34.026
TALK, DOGMAN!
IT'S MEOW OR NEVER.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.161
- CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDERS?

16:36.228 --> 16:39.264
- WAIT A MINUTE. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TAKING ME TO THE CAT CAVE.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.833
- YOU'RE IN THE CAT CAVE.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.769
IT'S A SWANKY JAZZ CLUB
ON THE PIER.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.739
THIS PLACE IS THE CAT'S MEOW.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.774
I MET MY THIRD WIFE HERE.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.211
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
CATS HAVE NINE WIVES.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.213
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THEY SAY THAT, DUDE.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.281
- WE'LL TAKE
TWO CLUB SODAS

16:56.348 --> 16:57.783
AND, UH, LET'S SEE--

16:57.850 --> 17:00.319
DO YOU WANT TO SPLIT
SOME CALAMARI?

17:00.386 --> 17:02.154
- SURE, WEIRDO.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.490
- NOW, TELL ME--
WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN

17:04.556 --> 17:07.893
YOUR FIENDISH SECRET WEAPON,
THE PIT BULL-DOZER?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.128
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE PIT BULL-DOZER IS,

17:10.194 --> 17:12.765
BUT I DID BURY MRS. TURNER'S
POT ROAST IN THEIR YARD.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.666
TRUST ME,
I WAS DOING TIMMY A FAVOR.

17:15.733 --> 17:19.003
- SPARKY, MOM'S LOOKING
FOR HER POT ROAST.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.939
SPARKY?
[telephone ringing]

17:21.006 --> 17:22.808
THIS IS TURNER.
SPEAK YOUR BUSINESS.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.176
- TIMMY, IT'S CATMAN.
- OH, BOY.

17:25.243 --> 17:28.781
- I'VE CAPTURED DOGMAN,
AND YOU'RE SAFE FROM DANGER.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.384
ALSO, THIS CALAMARI
IS TOP-NOTCH.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.786
- WAIT. WHAT?

17:33.852 --> 17:37.389
- THEY USE AN INCREDIBLE BLEND
OF EXOTIC SPICES.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.791
- NO, THE OTHER THING!

17:38.857 --> 17:41.427
- I'M TAKING DOGMAN
TO THE HOME OF JUSTICE

17:41.493 --> 17:42.995
AND PUTTING HIM DOWN.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.964
- CATMAN, I TOLD YOU,
THAT'S NOT DOGMAN.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.699
THAT'S MY DOG SPARKY!

17:47.766 --> 17:50.269
[jazz music playing]
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU, TIMMY.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.372
THE JAZZ BAND'S WARMING UP.
CATMAN OUT.

17:53.439 --> 17:56.074
- OH, NO. CATMAN'S TAKEN THIS
WAY TOO FAR.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.710
COSMO, WANDA, HELP!

17:58.777 --> 18:00.012
GUYS?

18:00.078 --> 18:01.413
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

18:01.480 --> 18:04.049
I PAID FOR THE ENTIRE
BAR MITZVAH,

18:04.116 --> 18:06.785
AND ALL I GOT WAS
THIS STUPID T-SHIRT.

18:06.852 --> 18:09.054
- "I GOT ROCKED
LIKE A HURRICANE

18:09.121 --> 18:11.723
AT RUBEN AND SAUL'S
BAR MITZVAH."

18:11.790 --> 18:14.893
- I'D RATHER BE IN A HURRICANE
THAN LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.395
- AND...

18:16.462 --> 18:17.696
THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.298
[both sigh with relief]

18:19.364 --> 18:21.633
- YOU THINK THOSE PHOTOS
WERE GOOD,

18:21.700 --> 18:24.703
I'VE GOT SOME GREAT ONES
FROM THEIR BABY NAMING.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.405
HERE'S THE SHIRT.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.241
- "I CUT A RUG
AND A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE

18:29.308 --> 18:32.411
AT RUBEN AND SAUL'S BRIS."

18:32.478 --> 18:35.614
- LOOKS LIKE I GOT TO SAVE
MY DOG WITHOUT MAGIC,

18:35.681 --> 18:37.950
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO PROVE TO CATMAN

18:38.016 --> 18:40.953
THAT SPARKY'S NOT
THE REAL DOGMAN.

18:42.888 --> 18:43.822
[clears throat]

18:43.889 --> 18:45.791
- WHO GOES THERE?

18:45.858 --> 18:47.259
- HI, MR. DOGMAN.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.394
I WAS DOWN THE HALL
VISITING CATMAN,

18:49.461 --> 18:51.563
AND NOW HE'S CONVINCED
THAT MY DOG IS YOU.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.533
- WHAT?
CATMAN'S HERE?

18:54.600 --> 18:57.970
I'VE SPENT THE LAST 50 YEARS
LOOKING FOR HIM,

18:58.036 --> 19:00.105
AND HE'S BEEN
RIGHT DOWN THE HALL?

19:00.172 --> 19:05.477
NOW I CAN FINALLY DESTROY HIM
USING MY PIT BULL-DOZER!

19:05.544 --> 19:07.880
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT
THE PART OF THE STORY

19:07.946 --> 19:09.348
THAT I NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.450
BESIDES, THE PIT BULL-DOZER'S
JUST A PROP

19:11.517 --> 19:12.918
FROM THE <i> CATMAN</i> SHOW.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.287
- I BARK TO DIFFER.

19:15.354 --> 19:19.758
THE PIT BULL-DOZER IS REAL
AND SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.929
[laughs evilly]
BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.268
- SPARKY WAS RIGHT.
THIS IS THE LOONY BIN.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.370
UGH!
STUPID DOGGIE DOOR!

19:33.205 --> 19:37.042
- NOW TO ANNIHILATE CATMAN!

19:37.109 --> 19:39.878
WHERE'S MY HENCHMAN,
THE SEEING EYE DOG,

19:39.945 --> 19:42.147
WHEN I NEED HIM?

19:44.716 --> 19:46.151
- AAH!

19:46.218 --> 19:49.621
- OKAY, WHO'S READY FOR SLIDES
OF MY TRIP TO BOCA?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.524
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
- BEING BORED TO DEATH.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.227
SERIOUSLY,
WHO TAKES 400 PICTURES

19:55.294 --> 19:57.563
OF THEIR GRANDKIDS'
FIRST HAIRCUT?

19:57.629 --> 20:00.999
- WE GOT TO RESCUE SPARKY
BEFORE CATMAN PUTS HIM DOWN!

20:01.066 --> 20:04.036
- HE'S GONNA INSULT HIM?
- NO, ANNIHILATE HIM!

20:04.102 --> 20:05.571
HE'S IN TERRIBLE DANGER.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.941
- BUT HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA
GET AWAY FROM BUTTERFLY BOY?

20:09.007 --> 20:12.344
- I DON'T KNOW--
WE COULD JUST WALK FAST.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.680
- WAIT! STOP!
COME BA--

20:14.746 --> 20:16.214
OH, TIRED.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.583
[snores]

20:19.418 --> 20:22.087
- [purring]
- SPARKY, YOU'RE OKAY!

20:22.154 --> 20:25.424
- TIMMY, EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW SPARKY'S IN DANGER?

20:25.490 --> 20:27.659
- I WAS IN DANGER,
BUT NO SENIOR CITIZEN

20:27.726 --> 20:30.028
CAN STAY AWAKE PAST 5:00.
- [snoring]

20:30.095 --> 20:33.165
- GUYS, POOF US OUT OF HERE!

20:33.231 --> 20:35.667
- NOT SO FAST, DOGMAN!

20:35.734 --> 20:37.536
- HE'S NOT DOGMAN!

20:37.603 --> 20:41.073
- COME ON, TIMMY,
I KNOW DOGMAN WHEN I SEE HIM,

20:41.139 --> 20:43.408
AND NOTHING
CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE...

20:45.143 --> 20:46.979
EXCEPT THAT.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.614
HOLY CATNIP!

20:48.680 --> 20:51.617
IT'S THE REAL DOGMAN
ON THE PIT BULL-DOZER.

20:51.683 --> 20:55.721
- I GUESS THAT FLOATING THUG
REALLY IS YOUR DOG, TIMMY.

20:55.787 --> 20:59.558
- PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR BREEDER, CATMAN!

20:59.625 --> 21:04.062
- TIMMY, STAND BACK
WHILE I CLAW OUT SOME JUSTICE!

21:06.298 --> 21:07.633
- OH, NO, TIMMY!

21:07.699 --> 21:09.968
HE'S ABOUT TO BE AS CANCELED
AS HIS SERIES.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.403
- I GOT TO HELP HIM.

21:11.470 --> 21:15.641
I WISH CATMAN HAD ALL THE POWERS
HE HAD ON HIS TV SHOW.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.652
- YOU'RE HISS-TORY, DOGMAN!

21:31.323 --> 21:32.424
HA HA HA HA!

21:32.491 --> 21:34.259
- AAH!

21:34.326 --> 21:36.795
BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK,
BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK.

21:36.862 --> 21:41.466
- AND NOW TO USE MY SONIC PURR
TO PUT YOU BACK IN YOUR CRATE!

21:41.533 --> 21:44.269
PURR!

21:44.336 --> 21:45.404
- BARK!

21:45.470 --> 21:47.806
[grunting]

21:47.873 --> 21:49.975
BARKY-BARK!
RUFF, RUFF!

21:50.042 --> 21:52.911
- AND ONCE AGAIN,
GOOD TRIUMPHS OVER EVIL.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.314
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THAT CRATE
FOR A LONG TIME, DOGMAN.

21:56.381 --> 22:00.686
- NO PROBLEM.
THERE'S A SOUP BONE IN HERE.

22:00.752 --> 22:01.987
[jazz music]

22:02.054 --> 22:05.290
- SORRY I MISTOOK YOU
FOR DOGMAN, SPARKY.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.459
- WELL, THAT'S OKAY, DUDE.
YOU'RE JUST DUMB.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.328
- GEE, THANKS
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.532
- CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?
- YOU WANT TO GET THE CALAMARI?

22:13.598 --> 22:16.268
- NO, LET'S GET
THE TUNA TOTS!

22:16.334 --> 22:19.337
- BY THE WAY, YOU NEVER PAID
YOUR BILL LAST TIME.

22:19.404 --> 22:22.074
- THAT'LL BE $132.50.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.109
- CAN YOU GET THIS, TIMMY?

22:24.176 --> 22:28.313
I LEFT MY WALLET
WITH MR. NUTS.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.948
SQUIRREL NOISE!
