Thank you, Carrie, you're
amazing. T-minus 24 hours

00:40.631 --> 00:42.598
until I'm sipping cold
Mai Tais on the warm beach.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.667
I still can't believe
you do Turks et Caicos

00:44.702 --> 00:46.735
- for Christmas, Amelia.
- It's my tradition.

00:46.771 --> 00:48.671
Trust me, once you try it,
you'll never go back

00:48.706 --> 00:50.606
to regular Christmas
festivities.

00:50.641 --> 00:52.541
Like sipping eggnog
by the fire?

00:52.577 --> 00:54.910
Exactly. I'll buy you
a ticket!

00:54.980 --> 00:57.280
No, come on, you've been
too generous this year.

00:57.315 --> 00:59.248
Besides, I thought
you invited Brad?

00:59.284 --> 01:01.150
I did, but Brad's set
on spending Christmas

01:01.186 --> 01:03.019
- at his parents'.
- I guess some people

01:03.088 --> 01:05.588
like the simple joys
of a traditional Christmas.

01:05.623 --> 01:08.824
What is more joyful
than sunshine? Anyway...

01:08.860 --> 01:11.094
I invited him to Christmas
dinner with my parents tonight.

01:11.129 --> 01:13.162
You're having
a Danish smorgasbord

01:13.198 --> 01:16.399
and it's December 18th...
It's not really the same thing.

01:16.434 --> 01:18.434
So, you nervous
for the big pitch?

01:18.470 --> 01:20.536
Carrie, we designed

01:20.605 --> 01:22.738
their top selling app. Bill
Burns needs us, we've got this.

01:22.773 --> 01:24.840
Correction: you designed
their top selling app.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.842
- You've got this.
- Well, either way,

01:26.911 --> 01:29.612
it's almost time to start
shopping on Christmas Assist!

01:31.549 --> 01:34.850
For 3 years,
our partnership on Closet Assist

01:34.886 --> 01:36.852
has offered
the individual shopper

01:36.888 --> 01:39.955
an unparalleled selection in
an over-saturated marketplace.

01:40.025 --> 01:42.892
Now, I'm about to revolutionize
the way we do

01:42.960 --> 01:44.560
our holiday shopping in an app.

01:44.595 --> 01:46.996
For those who want to escape
the chaos of Christmas,

01:47.032 --> 01:48.731
and get away from it all
without all the fuss,

01:48.799 --> 01:51.934
I give you Christmas Assist.

01:51.969 --> 01:55.138
More advanced than a gift
registry, our app consolidates

01:55.173 --> 01:57.140
your loved one's shopping
wish lists into one place.

01:57.208 --> 02:00.309
All you have to do is click
on their online profile like so,

02:00.345 --> 02:03.246
and you can browse,
buy it, and deliver it

02:03.281 --> 02:05.348
all in the click of a button.

02:05.383 --> 02:07.517
Interesting idea.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.919
What's even more interesting,
Bill, is that we've built in

02:09.954 --> 02:11.954
an algorithm that,
based on past purchases,

02:11.989 --> 02:15.024
not only buys the gift,
but also sends the card.

02:15.060 --> 02:17.200
Amelia, aren't you
concerned it takes

02:17.323 --> 02:19.791
some of the thoughtfulness
out of gift-giving?

02:19.826 --> 02:22.093
It also sort of ruins

02:22.128 --> 02:24.462
the element of surprise,
don't you think?

02:24.498 --> 02:27.064
Oh! Well... I mean,
you could look at it that way,

02:27.100 --> 02:29.834
but there is so much pressure
on what to buy these days.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.069
This way, you can rest easy
knowing you found

02:32.105 --> 02:34.171
exactly what
your loved one wants,

02:34.207 --> 02:36.173
without ever having
to be there in person.

02:39.379 --> 02:42.614
Now, you know we're big
supporters of Closet Assist,

02:42.649 --> 02:45.149
Amelia, and we were excited
to see how this app

02:45.218 --> 02:47.318
could benefit our clientele,

02:47.353 --> 02:50.588
but I'm not sure
that Christmas Assist

02:50.624 --> 02:53.090
encompasses the true
spirit of Christmas.

02:53.159 --> 02:55.159
It's a no.

02:55.194 --> 02:57.128
I'm sorry.

02:57.196 --> 02:59.797
(sad melody)

03:02.002 --> 03:04.201
What do they mean I don't know
Christmas? I was born

03:04.237 --> 03:06.538
in a town called Christmas
Creek... you can't get

03:06.606 --> 03:08.940
- more Christmassy than that!
- I thought you were

03:08.975 --> 03:11.609
- from San Francisco?
- I am. I mean...

03:11.645 --> 03:14.211
I moved to San Francisco when
I was 13. So, okay, technically,

03:14.247 --> 03:16.180
I haven't been back
to Christmas Creek in a while,

03:16.215 --> 03:19.250
- but I know Christmas.
- Yeah, of course!

03:19.285 --> 03:22.186
You're very... festive.

03:22.221 --> 03:24.288
Hmm.

03:26.426 --> 03:28.993
- They're right.
- Amelia...

03:29.029 --> 03:31.796
Don't let the investors get you
down. They just didn't get it.

03:31.865 --> 03:33.765
But it's my job
to make them get it.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.734
- I was certain it would be a yes.
- Because you're great

03:36.770 --> 03:39.037
at what you do. If anybody
knows apps and what people want,

03:39.072 --> 03:40.972
it's you.
(sighs)

03:41.007 --> 03:43.407
Any word from Brad on what
time he's coming to dinner?

03:43.443 --> 03:45.209
Yes. He apologizes,
but he's going to be late,

03:45.244 --> 03:47.111
but your parents will
see you right at 6.

03:47.146 --> 03:49.213
Right. Okay. Well,
then I better get cooking.

03:49.248 --> 03:51.515
Carrie?

03:51.551 --> 03:54.318
Thank you for everything.

03:54.387 --> 03:57.321
Oh... and Merry Christmas!

03:57.356 --> 03:59.457
Oh! Now, there's the spirit!

03:59.492 --> 04:01.759
(chuckles)

04:01.795 --> 04:04.696
(upbeat holiday music)

04:07.433 --> 04:09.867
It's only 4 flights of stairs.
It's good for the cardio, Dan.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.536
- My cardio is perfectly fine.
- Until you find work here,

04:12.572 --> 04:14.271
it's important
for your stress level.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.373
I'll tell you what'll help my
stress: not talking about it.

04:16.442 --> 04:19.410
- Hello, sweetie. Looks delicious.
- Hi, dinner's almost ready.

04:19.445 --> 04:21.980
Hi, honey. Do you want some
help with the frikadellers?

04:22.015 --> 04:24.448
I am preparing the smorgasbord
this year. You are my guest.

04:24.484 --> 04:26.751
- You do enough for us. Please.
- It's okay. Let me help you.

04:26.786 --> 04:28.686
Do you think the reason
I can't cook

04:28.755 --> 04:31.122
is because the Danes eat open
faced sandwiches for every meal?

04:31.190 --> 04:33.057
- (laughing)
- I think the reason

04:33.126 --> 04:34.959
you don't cook,
not that you can't,

04:34.995 --> 04:36.928
is because your focus
is on your work.

04:36.963 --> 04:39.831
- Is Brad coming?
- Later, he's stuck

04:39.866 --> 04:41.966
- at the office.
- Oh well... More cheese for me.

04:42.035 --> 04:44.002
Dan, why don't you
set the table?

04:44.037 --> 04:46.570
- (chuckles)
- What's this?

04:46.606 --> 04:49.473
- Doesn't matter.
- We received a letter

04:49.509 --> 04:51.542
from Hughes' Family Inn
this morning...

04:51.577 --> 04:53.577
What? From Uncle Harry?
How'd he find you in Chicago?

04:53.613 --> 04:55.847
It was forwarded
from our San Francisco address.

04:55.882 --> 04:57.682
It was originally
mailed back in November.

04:57.751 --> 05:00.284
- Are you going to open it?
- Ah, it's probably junk mail.

05:00.353 --> 05:02.219
(jazz music in the background)

05:02.288 --> 05:04.889
- How did your meeting go?
- Uh, it was fine. Great.

05:04.924 --> 05:07.491
Actually, not great at all.
The investors think

05:07.527 --> 05:10.494
- I don't understand Christmas.
- What's to understand?

05:10.563 --> 05:13.031
I'm sorry, honey. I know how
hard you worked on that app.

05:13.066 --> 05:16.233
Yeah, I just don't get it.
I'm hoping that Turks and Caicos

05:16.269 --> 05:19.570
will reinspire me because right
now, I don't know how to fix it.

05:19.639 --> 05:22.206
I'm sure you'll think
of something.

05:22.241 --> 05:24.475
You know, you could
stay here this year.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.011
Your dad's got
some interviews but--

05:27.080 --> 05:29.547
What, and we could do
another smorgasbord?

05:29.582 --> 05:32.516
Mom, you just moved, and we
don't ever do a big Christmas

05:32.585 --> 05:34.518
with just the 3 of us anyway,
so don't worry.

05:34.554 --> 05:37.188
Just focus on getting settled.

05:39.125 --> 05:42.660
Are you gonna open it, Dad,

05:42.696 --> 05:45.063
I am not opening that,
or the past.

05:45.098 --> 05:46.998
Maybe Uncle Harry
is reaching out?

05:47.033 --> 05:50.034
Well, he never has before, so
don't get your hopes up, honey.

05:50.103 --> 05:51.736
It's probably just
a general mail-out.

05:51.771 --> 05:53.738
You won't know
unless you open it, right?

05:53.807 --> 05:56.507
- Mm-hmm!
- Here. OK, I'll do it.

06:09.689 --> 06:12.790
Well. I guess
not much has changed.

06:18.664 --> 06:20.965
- Hello, hello!
- Brad, you made it.

06:21.034 --> 06:22.934
Sorry I'm late.
Work was crazy.

06:22.969 --> 06:25.402
It's okay. Things were crazy
here, too. I haven't even

06:25.438 --> 06:27.905
started packing yet.
My parents stuck around

06:27.941 --> 06:30.341
for as many rounds of Smorg as
they could, but you missed them.

06:30.376 --> 06:33.745
- Can I make you a sandwich?
- I'm okay. Thanks...

06:33.780 --> 06:36.214
Truth is,
I've been thinking.

06:36.282 --> 06:39.951
- I think we should talk.
- About Christmas.

06:39.986 --> 06:41.986
My parents really want
to meet you.

06:42.021 --> 06:43.988
And I would like
to meet them, too.

06:44.057 --> 06:45.689
So, why don't you want
to spend the holidays with us?

06:45.725 --> 06:47.792
It's not that...

06:47.827 --> 06:50.361
It's such a sweet offer, Brad,

06:50.396 --> 06:52.496
but I'm already booked
for Turks and Caicos.

06:52.531 --> 06:55.233
- You can go there any time.
- I understand that,

06:55.268 --> 06:57.902
but you know the holidays
are stressful for me.

06:57.937 --> 06:59.703
One argument between
your dad and uncle years ago

06:59.773 --> 07:01.739
shouldn't ruin
all family Christmases.

07:01.775 --> 07:03.540
I just like the peace
and quiet of the beach.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.643
I can't just lay on a beach
while my family is together

07:05.678 --> 07:07.645
for the holidays.
My parents are getting older...

07:07.713 --> 07:09.647
I want to spend
more time with them.

07:09.682 --> 07:11.415
- Then I don't know what to say.
- You just designed

07:11.450 --> 07:13.384
an entire app around
the holidays, and yet

07:13.419 --> 07:15.853
- you want nothing to do with it?
- Brad, just...

07:15.889 --> 07:17.621
Please, don't bring my app
into this right now.

07:17.657 --> 07:19.523
I just don't do
festive family stuff.

07:19.558 --> 07:21.492
I thought you were
okay with that.

07:21.527 --> 07:23.895
Not if my girlfriend never
wants to celebrate with me.

07:23.930 --> 07:26.497
Amelia, I'm really
trying here, but...

07:26.532 --> 07:30.234
But what?
(soft music)

07:30.270 --> 07:33.537
For 2 years, it's been
this push-pull dance we do.

07:33.572 --> 07:36.808
I try to move things forward,
and you keep pulling away.

07:36.876 --> 07:40.144
And I don't want
to dance anymore.

Mai Tais on the beach by myself

09:00.860 --> 09:05.096

- So, what're you gonna do?

09:07.233 --> 09:09.600

I once cut off all my hair

No, I'm... I'm going
to Christmas Creek.

- Wait, what is this?
- Fly By Santa.

started 40 years ago,

09:22.081 --> 09:24.949
collecting toys for needy
children in remote areas

09:24.984 --> 09:27.651
and delivering them by plane
on Christmas Eve.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.521
This is me.

09:30.556 --> 09:32.890
That's you? You're so cute!

09:32.926 --> 09:36.394
I was Santa's Little Helper.
I was his co-pilot when we flew.

09:36.462 --> 09:39.863
Of course you were.
But, wait... I thought

09:39.899 --> 09:41.999
you haven't been to Christmas
Creek since you were a kid?

10:57.543 --> 10:59.343
That's so you can ask
a local for directions.

10:59.412 --> 11:01.312
- Oh...
- Where you headed?

11:01.381 --> 11:04.448
I'm looking for Hughes' Family
Inn. I thought it was this way.

11:04.484 --> 11:07.718
You're nearly there. Just
about half a mile down the road,

11:07.753 --> 11:09.786
- then take a right.
- Oh!

11:09.822 --> 11:11.788
But, you know,
you shouldn't be

11:11.824 --> 11:13.757
driving these roads
without winter tires.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.792
I know, I clearly
didn't plan well.

11:15.828 --> 11:19.130
- I wasn't supposed to be here...
- Well, don't sound too excited.

11:19.198 --> 11:21.965
- (laughing)
- Why don't you follow me?

11:22.001 --> 11:24.968
- Then you get some proper tires.
- What are you, the road police?

11:25.038 --> 11:27.438
Actually, I do search
and rescue for the area,

11:27.473 --> 11:29.407
and I'd hate to have
to pull you out of the ditch.

11:29.442 --> 11:32.543
Right! OK.
Well, I appreciate that.

11:32.578 --> 11:35.246
- Follow me, I'll get you there.
- Thank you!

11:35.281 --> 11:37.981
Alright, no problem.

Uh, no, I moved to Chicago
a few years ago for work

13:02.201 --> 13:04.602
to launch a shopping app
called Closet Assist.

22:48.690 --> 22:51.758
I didn't realize this
constituted Search and Rescue.

22:51.793 --> 22:55.261
Nah, I'm off duty.
Just being a good Samaritan.

22:55.329 --> 22:57.430
You having fun yet?

22:57.465 --> 22:59.465
Besides the recurring car
trouble, yeah, it's been great.

22:59.500 --> 23:04.136
- Why'd you come back? Really?
- It has come to my attention

23:04.172 --> 23:06.405
that I may not appreciate
Christmas the way I used to.

23:06.441 --> 23:09.341
So, here I am,
appreciating Christmas.

23:09.377 --> 23:11.945
- What is in the box?
- Toys

23:12.013 --> 23:14.781
- for the Fly By Santa delivery.
- Wait-- You help with Fly By?

23:14.816 --> 23:17.083
Harry's co-pilot for 16 years.

23:18.887 --> 23:21.120
He didn't have anyone else.

23:21.155 --> 23:24.724
Right, of course,
that makes sense.

23:24.759 --> 23:27.026
Harry knows you had
no choice in leaving.

23:27.095 --> 23:30.029
How about you?

23:30.065 --> 23:33.265
You know, we were kids.

23:33.301 --> 23:36.703
We tried to keep in touch,
but that's life.

23:36.738 --> 23:40.106
- Why?
- No, that's good.

23:40.141 --> 23:42.374
How's Uncle Harry been?

23:42.410 --> 23:46.412
That's your family's stuff. I
probably shouldn't get involved.

23:46.447 --> 23:51.450
- Please, just tell me.
- Okay, considering.

23:51.486 --> 23:53.853
- He had to give up a lot.
- We all did.

23:53.888 --> 23:55.989
Harry hasn't really had time

23:56.024 --> 23:59.659
- for anything other than work.
- Do you mean... Pamela?

23:59.694 --> 24:03.630
Like I said, I probably
shouldn't get involved.

24:03.665 --> 24:05.965
(engine starting)

24:06.001 --> 24:08.935
Alright! You just give
a little twist

24:08.970 --> 24:11.403
- and a whole lot of love.
- Thank you, Mike.

24:11.439 --> 24:14.841
- Well, I'll see you.
- Yeah, see you.

24:29.724 --> 24:34.027
Uncle Harry? Are you here?

25:30.732 --> 25:34.334
Thanks for helping out, Scout.
We're making great progress.

25:34.403 --> 25:37.870
Think Harry will let me co-
pilot for Fly By Santa one day?

25:37.906 --> 25:41.741
It's not an easy job. You
really want that responsibility?

25:41.776 --> 25:44.610
- I wanna be like you.
- That's very sweet.

25:46.581 --> 25:49.215
There are lots of girls
who are pilots, you know.

25:49.251 --> 25:51.784
I know. And you would
make a great pilot.

25:51.819 --> 25:55.488
You think Dad will be back
in time for Christmas?

25:55.524 --> 25:58.058
I don't know.

25:58.093 --> 26:00.326
He's really busy keeping
this country safe.

26:00.362 --> 26:03.796
But he'd do anything to be here
with you. In the meantime,

26:03.831 --> 26:07.534
you got me. I know
I'm not your dad,

26:07.569 --> 26:09.802
- but I'm your number one uncle.
- You're my only uncle.

26:09.837 --> 26:12.572
And I also love ya to pieces,
so that counts for something.

26:36.364 --> 26:39.899
Master off, avionics off,
autopilot off,

26:39.934 --> 26:42.335
carb heat off,

26:42.370 --> 26:44.637
mixture full rich,

26:44.672 --> 26:46.506
prop full fine...

26:50.145 --> 26:52.178
Thought
you couldn't remember?

26:52.214 --> 26:55.115
I was just playing around...
sorry.

26:55.150 --> 26:59.252
I watched you come down here
from my office.

27:01.189 --> 27:04.857
- Do you wanna come up?
- Yeah.

27:04.892 --> 27:07.327
<i>Okay, master off,</i>

27:07.362 --> 27:09.562
- avionics off, autopilot off...
- Mixture

27:09.598 --> 27:13.366
- full rich, prop full fine...
- See? You remember.

27:13.435 --> 27:15.635
Yeah, I guess some
things stay with you.

27:15.703 --> 27:18.871
I saw Pamela in town today.

27:18.940 --> 27:22.041
- She says hi.
- Oh, good. How is she doing?

27:22.076 --> 27:24.511
Good.

27:24.546 --> 27:26.879
When did you two break up?

27:26.914 --> 27:30.350
A long time ago.

27:30.385 --> 27:33.186
Because we left?

27:33.221 --> 27:36.922
She tried to stay...

27:36.958 --> 27:38.858
You don't have to tell me.

27:38.893 --> 27:41.161
It's okay. It's okay.

27:41.196 --> 27:45.598
It was the summer after
everybody... left.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.800
It was her birthday,

27:47.835 --> 27:49.902
we had plans,

27:49.937 --> 27:52.138
but there was an emergency

27:52.174 --> 27:55.175
at the inn, so...

27:55.210 --> 27:57.977
I tried to make it up
to her, but, uh...

27:58.012 --> 28:00.647
it had happened before.

28:00.682 --> 28:03.650
No, she did the right thing.

28:03.685 --> 28:07.420
Pamela deserves somebody
who'll make time for her.

28:09.357 --> 28:13.226
You know, I saw that same
regret in Pamela's eyes today.

28:16.164 --> 28:18.064
What about you?

28:18.099 --> 28:21.167
- Anybody special in your life?
- Not anymore.

28:21.203 --> 28:24.003
- Did you love the guy?
- I don't know.

28:24.072 --> 28:27.307
His name was Brad. He wanted me
to spend Christmas

28:27.342 --> 28:31.444
at his parents' and I didn't,

28:31.513 --> 28:34.980
so he broke up with me. And now
I'm here and I feel really bad.

28:35.016 --> 28:37.617
You know, if he was the right
one, you'd probably be with him.

28:37.686 --> 28:41.987
Would I? I don't really do big
family Christmases, Uncle Harry.

28:42.056 --> 28:45.825
And yet, you're here.
(laughing)

28:45.860 --> 28:49.395
- You hungry?
- For dinner? Yeah.

28:49.431 --> 28:53.766
I was thinking,
get some take-out?

28:55.270 --> 28:58.204
OFF, OFF, OFF, ON...

28:58.273 --> 29:00.940
Prop full fine, throttle
slightly cracked...

29:01.008 --> 29:03.876
Starter engaged.

29:05.913 --> 29:07.847
Let's go.

29:17.325 --> 29:20.360
Here we go.

29:20.395 --> 29:22.828
(laughing)

29:22.897 --> 29:25.498
Pretty great, isn't it?

29:25.533 --> 29:28.134
- It's amazing.
- Yeah,

29:28.169 --> 29:32.204
there really isn't
anything like this.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.440
Gives you a new perspective.

29:34.476 --> 29:36.509
Like how small and
insignificant we are

29:36.544 --> 29:38.711
- in the grand scheme of things?
- Or infinite.

29:38.780 --> 29:41.514
It's freedom up here.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.816
I tend to see things differently

29:43.851 --> 29:46.586
from a bird's
point of view.

30:05.873 --> 30:09.008
- Hey, let me help you.
- Hey!

30:09.076 --> 30:12.378
Sure. I try to do it
in one trip.

30:12.414 --> 30:15.114
- Most of the time I can.
- I remember that, yeah.

30:15.149 --> 30:18.851
- I can help you with this.
- Oh no, I'm okay.

30:18.886 --> 30:23.055
- Okay.
- Yeah, just put it down there.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.425
Oof!

30:25.460 --> 30:29.329
- So I ran into Amelia.
- Yeah, she mentioned that.

30:29.364 --> 30:34.066
Wow. It must be so strange,
good, having her here.

30:34.101 --> 30:36.769
Well, I took her
flying yesterday.

30:36.805 --> 30:39.138
- Wow, I bet she loved that.
- Yeah, it was nice.

30:39.207 --> 30:41.708
Hey, Harry!
Your Christmas mocha.

30:41.743 --> 30:46.278
- Coffee from my competitor?
- Well, you weren't open,

30:46.348 --> 30:49.782
and Phil makes a mean
Christmas mocha. Thanks.

30:49.818 --> 30:51.884
- Merry Christmas, Phil.
- Merry Christmas, Pam.

30:51.919 --> 30:55.154
- I was just joking!
- Yeah.

30:56.825 --> 31:00.827
Um, so Pam, I was...
I was thinking--

31:00.862 --> 31:03.763
Oh my gosh! I have biscotti
in the oven! I nearly forgot.

31:03.832 --> 31:06.999
- Anyway, you were gonna say--
- No, it's not important.

31:07.068 --> 31:09.902
- No, what were you--
- No, you better check on that,

31:09.937 --> 31:12.304
- 'cause burnt biscotti...
- That's true.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.707
Okay, well,

31:14.743 --> 31:17.176
nice to see you.

31:17.211 --> 31:20.413
Good to see you.
Always. And...

31:20.448 --> 31:23.616
- you were always very clever.
- Oh...

31:37.632 --> 31:39.699
Amelia,

31:39.734 --> 31:43.202
- you made it!
- Scout, hey!

31:43.237 --> 31:45.705
- You should join us.
- Oh, that's so nice,

31:45.740 --> 31:48.408
- but I wouldn't want to intrude.
- It's not an intrusion.

31:48.443 --> 31:51.511
- Mike, hi!
- Hey.

31:51.546 --> 31:53.479
You know Uncle Mike?

31:53.515 --> 31:55.948
Amelia and I used to go
to school together way back.

31:56.017 --> 31:58.217
We actually used
to be best friends.

31:58.286 --> 32:02.688
So, you'll join us? It's
the first stage of building

32:02.724 --> 32:05.257
and the official judging
is at the Tree Lighting.

32:05.293 --> 32:08.994
- Uh... yeah, sure, okay.
- Yeah? Alright.

32:09.030 --> 32:11.263
You guys get started. I'll go
get pretzels and jellybeans.

32:11.299 --> 32:13.833
Okay, you do that.

32:13.868 --> 32:16.836
So, you're an uncle?

32:16.871 --> 32:19.605
- You seem surprised.
- No, it's great.

32:19.674 --> 32:23.476
It's actually the best. I'd do
anything for Scout and my sis.

32:23.511 --> 32:26.011
Wait, so the gift shop
is Elise's?

32:26.047 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, she took it over
about a year ago.

32:28.115 --> 32:30.282
- Amazing. Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

32:30.318 --> 32:33.986
- You have any kids of your own?
- Uh...

32:34.021 --> 32:36.722
No, not yet.

32:36.758 --> 32:40.893
I just haven't found the right
person, you know? How 'bout you?

32:40.929 --> 32:43.228
Me? Ha, no.

32:43.264 --> 32:46.566
I mean, someday I hope.
But work's been really busy,

32:46.601 --> 32:50.169
and I just got out of
a relationship, so...

32:50.204 --> 32:53.906
Yeah, just... it wasn't right.
We wanted different things.

32:53.942 --> 32:56.642
I was actually supposed to be in
Turks and Caicos for Christmas.

32:56.678 --> 32:59.445
- But you're here.
- It's a little strange, I know.

32:59.481 --> 33:02.615
I don't think it's strange.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.984
Someone over there
has a reindeer stables.

33:05.052 --> 33:08.120
We have to get really creative
if we want to win.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.990
Yeah, well, we better get
building now! What do you think?

33:11.025 --> 33:14.426
- Yeah? Okay.
- Let's do it.

33:25.601 --> 33:29.102
- Hey, Mom!
- What is that?

33:29.138 --> 33:32.506
Only the coolest
gingerbread house around.

33:32.542 --> 33:34.775
And the snowmen are mine.

33:34.811 --> 33:37.445
It's not finished yet, but
hopefully it's enough to win.

33:37.480 --> 33:42.015
- I'll be rooting for you two.
- Three. Amelia's helping us.

33:42.051 --> 33:44.985
You know Uncle Mike has a friend
named after Amelia Earhart?

33:45.020 --> 33:47.421
Are we talking
about Amelia Hughes?

33:49.124 --> 33:52.059
No big deal. Amelia's in town
visiting Harry for Christmas.

33:52.094 --> 33:54.094
No big deal?
She was your best friend

33:54.129 --> 33:56.497
for most of childhood. He was
pretty obsessed with her.

33:56.532 --> 34:00.434
OK, I was not obsessed.
It was just a minor crush.

34:00.470 --> 34:04.638
- How is she? What's she like?
- Beautiful and really cool.

34:04.674 --> 34:07.174
She's fine. Normal.

34:07.209 --> 34:10.745
- And she says hi.
- Fine? Normal?

34:10.780 --> 34:12.913
I think we're really gonna have
to work on your flirting.

34:12.947 --> 34:15.516
Okay, it's not like that.
She's just a friend.

34:15.551 --> 34:18.719
- Always been just a friend.
- Then maybe you won't mind

34:18.755 --> 34:21.489
dropping this box off
to Harry at the inn?

34:21.524 --> 34:24.458
What am I, your
delivery boy now?

34:24.527 --> 34:27.661
- I prefer Santa's Helper.
- Oh, okay.

34:27.697 --> 34:30.664
(festive music)

34:35.938 --> 34:38.639
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hey.

34:38.674 --> 34:41.574
Just hanging Christmas stockings
for the guests and the staff.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.378
It gives them something
to open Christmas morning.

34:44.447 --> 34:48.449
That's thoughtful... and a lot
of work. You do it every year?

34:48.484 --> 34:50.818
Well, it's become
a bit of a tradition.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.554
Can you give me that one?
We have so many return guests,

34:53.589 --> 34:57.458
we like to personalize it. They
have sort of become like family.

34:57.493 --> 35:00.093
It's thoughtful with
the element of surprise.

35:00.162 --> 35:03.597
- Sorry?
- My investors would love this.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.699
They said Christmas Assist
took the thoughtfulness

35:05.735 --> 35:08.168
out of gift giving,
so... they passed.

35:08.203 --> 35:11.772
Well, sometimes things don't
work out the way we planned,

35:11.841 --> 35:14.842
but it leaves space
for something better.

35:14.911 --> 35:17.745
Are you saying I should go
into the stocking business?

35:17.780 --> 35:20.581
Oh yes, I think it'd be very
lucrative. Difficult to produce

35:20.616 --> 35:23.484
- for millions, though.
- That's why you need an app.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.320
You know, you're
hanging stockings,

35:26.355 --> 35:28.288
but the cabin still doesn't
have a Christmas tree.

35:28.357 --> 35:32.426
Ah, I was hoping that you
would help me with that. Oh--

35:32.462 --> 35:36.464
- Santa's delivery service.
- Mike!

35:36.499 --> 35:39.600
Elise wanted me to bring this
by. Some lights and decorations

35:39.635 --> 35:42.169
from her gift shop
that you put aside.

35:42.204 --> 35:45.305
Then I thought...
a little Christmas

35:45.374 --> 35:48.308
- for your room.
- It's so cute! Thank you.

35:48.344 --> 35:50.611
Mike, what do you think about
helping Amelia find a tree?

35:50.646 --> 35:52.446
You're not coming with me?

35:52.515 --> 35:55.015
I'd love to, but I got
too much to do around here.

35:55.050 --> 35:58.018
Sure, I'd love to help out.

35:58.053 --> 36:01.822
Great. Come on,
get going! Get going!

36:01.858 --> 36:04.992
(festive music)

36:10.666 --> 36:13.601
Ahh! Well?

36:13.636 --> 36:16.737
Let's do this, huh?
(laughing)

36:16.806 --> 36:20.941
- Oh, I remember this smell.
- Yeah, fresh pine trees.

36:20.977 --> 36:24.144
There's something special
about tree hunting.

36:24.179 --> 36:26.547
No offense, but being an
outdoorsy Search and Rescue guy,

36:26.582 --> 36:28.582
I would've thought you cut down
your own tree.

36:28.651 --> 36:30.985
I would, I just wanna,
you know,

36:31.020 --> 36:34.855
- support local businesses.
- Ha! Right, that must be it.

36:34.891 --> 36:38.959
Hey, don't forget,
I'm here helping you.

36:38.995 --> 36:41.629
Do you remember when we were
kids and we used to pick trees?

36:41.664 --> 36:43.564
You always went
for the skinniest one.

36:43.599 --> 36:45.533
They were the runts
of the tree lot.

36:45.568 --> 36:47.668
I was just trying to give them
a chance at a happy Christmas.

36:47.703 --> 36:52.006
- I'm sure they were grateful.
- There it is!

36:52.041 --> 36:56.209
Okay, I can't take that twig
back to the cabin, okay?

36:56.245 --> 36:58.178
Sorry.

36:58.213 --> 37:01.682
Oh, you see that?
Now that is a tree.

37:01.717 --> 37:04.451
Um, no, we'll never be
able to carry that.

37:04.486 --> 37:07.254
Yeah, we can. Come on,

37:07.289 --> 37:09.790
I've got faith in us.

37:09.825 --> 37:13.594
Well, I am glad
one of us does.

37:13.629 --> 37:18.231
- Well, shall we?
- Okay.

37:18.267 --> 37:21.869
I can't believe you still have

37:21.904 --> 37:24.104
these decorations.
I made this macaroni angel

37:24.139 --> 37:27.007
in second grade.

37:27.043 --> 37:31.211
- You loved Christmas Angels.
- You remember that?

37:31.246 --> 37:33.480
- Yeah, of course.
- Maybe it's time for an update.

37:33.515 --> 37:35.415
No, it is perfect.

37:35.451 --> 37:37.517
Okay, well, what do we think?
How does it look?

37:37.553 --> 37:40.020
- It's beautiful.
- It's fantastic.

37:40.089 --> 37:42.923
Yeah. Thanks, guys, for
getting this great tree.

37:42.959 --> 37:45.292
- (phone buzzing)
- Oh, sorry.

37:45.327 --> 37:48.929
One second. Hey, Carrie,
what's going on?

37:48.965 --> 37:52.299
[Hey! Just wanted to see how
it's going. Any inspiration?]

37:52.334 --> 37:56.303
- Oh, yeah, maybe a little. Why?
- [Just wondering,]

37:56.338 --> 37:59.206
[do you want me to put together
a list of other investors,]

37:59.241 --> 38:02.242
- [or go back to Bill Burns?]
- It's four days till Christmas.

38:02.311 --> 38:04.645
Aren't you with your family?
We can worry about it all later.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.681
[What have you done
with my boss?]

38:07.717 --> 38:11.051
- [Merry Christmas, Amelia.]
- You too, Carrie.

38:11.087 --> 38:14.387
- [Bye.]
- Bye.

38:14.456 --> 38:17.091
Thanks so much for
helping me out, both of you.

38:17.126 --> 38:20.227
- Of course, Harry.
- You guys hungry?

38:20.295 --> 38:22.329
What do you say to
some dinner, huh? On me.

38:22.397 --> 38:26.500
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- How about Italian?

38:28.437 --> 38:31.005
I think people are surprised
to see you out at night.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.873
I go out.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.977
Sometimes.
(laughing)

38:37.013 --> 38:40.413
- Hi.
- Twice in one day!

38:40.449 --> 38:43.216
Aren't I lucky?

38:43.285 --> 38:44.652
Hi, guys!

38:44.687 --> 38:46.286
- Hi.
- Hi, Pam.

38:46.321 --> 38:49.189
- Looks really great.
- Oh, thanks.

38:49.224 --> 38:53.493
Our special today is garlic
prawn Fettuccini Alfredo.

38:53.529 --> 38:55.428
House made, of course.

38:55.464 --> 38:58.298
- Hard to resist.
- That sounds so good.

38:58.367 --> 39:01.501
Anyway, I'll let you
have a few minutes

39:01.537 --> 39:06.073
- to decide.
- The last time I was here

39:06.142 --> 39:09.109
was when Dad took us out and he
let me order whatever I wanted.

39:09.145 --> 39:11.344
That's because he already knew
that he was leaving.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.580
I knew something was up
when he was so insistent

39:13.615 --> 39:16.850
- on paying for dinner.
- Good evening, everyone.

39:16.886 --> 39:19.019
Thank you for sharing the most
wonderful time of the year

39:19.055 --> 39:22.289
here with us here at Mistletoe.
It's nice to see familiar faces.

39:22.357 --> 39:25.092
This first one goes out
to an old friend.

39:25.127 --> 39:29.897
It was always her favorite.
Welcome home, Amelia.

39:29.965 --> 39:33.200
(playing <i> Deck the Halls)</i>

39:43.612 --> 39:47.480
- Oof! Harry left in a flash.
- He got a call from the inn.

39:47.516 --> 39:50.684
But honestly, I think he
might've been overwhelmed.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.320
(chuckling)

39:53.355 --> 39:57.390
You know, I forgot Pamela sings.

39:57.426 --> 40:01.494
You remember when Harry used
to take us to a restaurant

40:01.563 --> 40:04.497
and he and Pamela would sing
together at the piano?

40:04.533 --> 40:07.735
Yeah. There's still something
between them. I can tell.

40:07.770 --> 40:10.204
Yeah. All this time and...

40:10.239 --> 40:12.405
not much has changed,

40:12.441 --> 40:14.341
yet everything has.

40:14.376 --> 40:16.676
It's strange to think how one
moment in time can change

40:16.712 --> 40:18.979
- everything for someone.
- Yeah.

40:19.048 --> 40:21.381
- Why didn't you ever leave?
- Christmas Creek?

40:21.416 --> 40:25.719
I did. I went to flight school.
I was in the air force

40:25.755 --> 40:28.055
- for five years as a pilot.
- You kidding? That's amazing.

40:28.124 --> 40:32.392
My dad got sick, and I wanted
to be here in his final days

40:32.427 --> 40:34.862
so I moved home.

40:34.930 --> 40:38.065
- I had no idea. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

40:38.100 --> 40:42.169
Harry became the closest thing I
had to family besides my sister.

40:42.238 --> 40:44.772
Elise had Scout,

40:44.807 --> 40:47.407
and Will, her husband,
was away often,

40:47.442 --> 40:51.411
- so I couldn't leave.
- Yeah.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.248
You know, this town

40:54.283 --> 40:58.385
has shown me family in ways
I could never give back.

40:58.420 --> 41:01.121
But I try
nonetheless.

41:06.061 --> 41:09.196
I forgot how many stars
there were in the sky.

41:09.231 --> 41:12.032
The benefit of a small town.
Not many lights.

41:12.067 --> 41:14.201
Yeah.

41:14.236 --> 41:18.371
- You haven't left the city?
- Not much.

41:18.407 --> 41:21.474
C'mon, I wanna
show you something.

41:23.412 --> 41:26.413
How did you remember
the inn has a telescope?

41:26.481 --> 41:29.116
Oh, Harry lets me borrow it
whenever I want.

41:29.151 --> 41:31.518
I say it's for Scout,
but... it's really for me.

41:31.553 --> 41:33.687
(laughing)

41:33.755 --> 41:36.190
Being near the stars was the
reason I was drawn to flying,

41:36.225 --> 41:38.491
and flying led me
to Search and Rescue.

41:38.527 --> 41:42.262
I don't know how you do that.
You don't find it scary?

41:42.298 --> 41:45.332
No. Not really.
What scares me most

41:45.367 --> 41:47.734
is all the people
I can't help.

41:47.769 --> 41:50.704
You're a good person, Mike.

41:50.772 --> 41:53.473
Thanks, Meels.
So are you.

41:53.542 --> 41:56.776
I used to think I was.
I had dreams of growing up

41:56.812 --> 41:59.679
and doing something
remarkable, you know?

41:59.715 --> 42:03.283
- Is that what drew you to apps?
- I grew up near the tech world.

42:03.319 --> 42:05.285
I wanted to be
an entrepreneur

42:05.354 --> 42:07.487
and creating an app just seemed
like the smart thing to do.

42:07.522 --> 42:10.958
The world is becoming more
reliant on their devices,

42:11.026 --> 42:14.294
so I just wanted to bring more
convenience into their lives.

42:14.330 --> 42:18.465
- Sounds honorable.
- Is it? I mean, look at you.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.301
You help the people of this town
and kids in need.

42:21.337 --> 42:25.072
You're a hero.
I help people buy things.

42:25.140 --> 42:28.208
I'm just a guy, Meels.

42:28.244 --> 42:31.044
The same guy you knew
growing up.

42:31.113 --> 42:33.113
And you...

42:33.148 --> 42:35.815
are still the same girl I knew.

42:35.851 --> 42:39.486
I don't think that's true.
That girl had wide eyes

42:39.554 --> 42:43.423
and a sense of wonder. I don't
think I have that anymore.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.558
Yeah, you do.

42:45.594 --> 42:48.495
You know why I know?

42:48.530 --> 42:51.564
Because... take a look.

42:55.971 --> 42:59.973
- Oh, wow...
- Isn't it something?

43:00.009 --> 43:03.610
I think that's the Pleiades.

43:03.678 --> 43:06.346
Oh my God...

43:06.382 --> 43:09.082
Hey!
(laughing)

43:09.118 --> 43:13.086
- Oh, you are going down, Ruggles!
- Whoa!

43:13.122 --> 43:16.390
Ah, it's cold!
(laughing)

43:19.929 --> 43:23.496
You know what, Mike?
I missed this.

43:25.434 --> 43:28.701
I missed it, too.

43:28.737 --> 43:32.639
(laughing)

43:50.775 --> 43:53.408
I love that photo.

43:53.444 --> 43:56.311
Yeah. Yeah.

43:56.347 --> 43:58.681
- Have a good time with Mike?
- Yeah,

43:58.716 --> 44:01.150
we looked at the stars and then
had a snowball fight.

44:01.185 --> 44:03.418
Gingerbread cookies!
Do you mind?

44:03.454 --> 44:05.587
Help yourself.

44:07.525 --> 44:10.993
You know, I forgot
Grandpa used to fly.

44:11.029 --> 44:13.796
Yeah, Dad would bring us up on
weekends. I was so surprised

44:13.831 --> 44:18.034
that Dan didn't take to it.
I suppose his head

44:18.069 --> 44:21.203
was always in the books and my
head was always in the clouds.

44:21.238 --> 44:23.572
- What do you mean?
- Oh, well,

44:23.641 --> 44:27.409
he was a natural
for business.

44:27.444 --> 44:30.680
He used to get on my case about
taking things more seriously,

44:30.715 --> 44:33.282
but I was always
greeting the guests

44:33.350 --> 44:36.686
and being a showman.
A regular Santa Claus.

44:36.754 --> 44:39.689
Yeah, but that's who you are.

44:39.724 --> 44:41.791
It's who you've always been.

44:41.826 --> 44:44.526
- And you're good at it.
- It's no way to run an inn,

44:44.562 --> 44:47.697
and I had to learn
the hard way.

44:47.732 --> 44:51.333
- That's when my life changed.
- But now the inn is successful,

44:51.368 --> 44:54.737
and you've done it by yourself.
I think Dad would be proud.

44:54.772 --> 44:57.539
Why don't you reach out?

44:57.575 --> 45:00.843
Danny and me--
so much has been said

45:00.912 --> 45:03.512
- that can't be unsaid, you know?
- I don't know.

45:03.547 --> 45:07.750
Honestly, I don't even know how
it happened between you and Dad

45:07.785 --> 45:11.153
and why we had to leave so
suddenly on Christmas Eve.

45:11.189 --> 45:14.056
Okay, so... when
Danny got the offer

45:14.092 --> 45:17.126
to work at Baroncrest Hotels

45:17.161 --> 45:20.429
and he said he was leaving,

45:20.497 --> 45:23.933
I was just so...

45:23.968 --> 45:25.968
angry.

45:26.003 --> 45:30.472
It was right before Fly By,
and I was just so hurt.

45:30.507 --> 45:33.242
And I said to him:
"Well, if you're leaving,

45:33.310 --> 45:36.712
- you might as well leave now."
- I see.

45:36.748 --> 45:40.349
I know I haven't always dealt
with things in the best way.

45:40.384 --> 45:44.419
I've said a lot of things
I'm not proud of, and...

45:44.488 --> 45:48.390
I'm so sorry that I never
reached out to you guys

45:48.425 --> 45:52.795
over the years. I wanted to.

45:52.830 --> 45:56.165
But for what it's worth, I never
wanted any of you to leave.

45:58.335 --> 46:00.602
I've missed you, Uncle Harry.

46:00.638 --> 46:03.605
I've missed you, too, Amelia.

46:16.888 --> 46:20.156
(He hums <i> We Wish You
a Merry Christmas.)</i>

46:20.191 --> 46:22.557
Ah, there you are.
Good afternoon.

46:22.593 --> 46:25.494
Good afternoon. I got caught
working on my app, or trying to,

46:25.529 --> 46:28.097
- and now I need a break.
- Well, perfect timing.

46:28.132 --> 46:30.833
I just made us some lunch,
so help yourself,

46:30.868 --> 46:33.002
take something to eat,
and when you're done,

46:33.037 --> 46:36.005
- come meet me at the plane.
- Are we going flying again?

46:36.040 --> 46:39.408
No, this time we are
decorating it.

46:39.443 --> 46:42.611
- Just like old times.
- That's right. So eat up.

46:46.951 --> 46:50.219
<i>And then she gets me with a
snowball in the back of my neck.</i>

46:50.288 --> 46:52.288
I was shocked,
considering I don't think

46:52.323 --> 46:54.523
she's played in the snow
since she was 13.

46:54.558 --> 46:56.358
What?

46:56.427 --> 46:58.227
Nothing.

46:58.262 --> 47:02.164
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I told you we're just friends.

47:02.200 --> 47:04.766
- It's nice to see you happy.
- I'm always happy.

47:04.802 --> 47:07.469
You've spent your whole life
giving to others.

47:07.504 --> 47:10.605
You make your work, your family,
your charity the most important.

47:10.641 --> 47:12.741
You deserve love, too.

47:12.810 --> 47:16.678
- OK, stop. We're just friends.
- Okay.

47:16.714 --> 47:19.481
Yeah, you just keep on
telling yourself that.

47:19.516 --> 47:21.717
- (phone buzzing)
- Look who it is!

47:21.752 --> 47:23.652
- Scout!
- Is it Dad?

47:23.687 --> 47:25.620
It's Dad!

47:25.656 --> 47:28.190
- Dad, I wrapped your present!
- [You did?]

47:28.226 --> 47:30.659
[I can't wait to get it.
Is your mom there?]

47:30.694 --> 47:32.728
I'm here. Hi, honey,
how are you?

47:32.763 --> 47:34.930
[Hi, sweetie.
I'm good. Good now.]

47:34.999 --> 47:37.867
- When are you coming home?
- [As soon as I can.]

47:37.902 --> 47:41.737
- [Is that Mike in the back?]
- Hey, looking good, Will.

47:41.805 --> 47:44.406
[Hey, Mike. Thanks for taking
care of my girls for me.]

47:44.441 --> 47:46.708
[What are you talking about?
They're keeping an eye on me.]

47:46.744 --> 47:48.810
Will you be home
for Christmas?

47:48.846 --> 47:51.280
[There's nowhere else I wanna
be than home for Christmas.]

47:51.315 --> 47:55.150
[I'm gonna do everything I can
to be there. You just-- ]

47:55.186 --> 47:58.653
Dad? Dad?
Are you there?

48:02.894 --> 48:04.860
It's okay.

48:09.233 --> 48:11.967
I can't believe it's the 40th
Anniversary of Fly By Santa

48:12.003 --> 48:14.569
and you still have
the same plane.

48:14.605 --> 48:17.139
Yeah, well, she's a classic.

48:17.174 --> 48:19.074
Lucky for us, the lake
hasn't frozen over.

48:19.110 --> 48:21.510
That always makes Fly By
a little extra challenging.

48:21.545 --> 48:24.213
Did you always know
what you loved?

48:24.248 --> 48:28.317
Yeah, I've always
loved flying.

48:30.254 --> 48:33.022
I think the things we love are
always a part of who we are.

48:33.057 --> 48:35.524
We just have to remember that.

48:37.494 --> 48:39.728
When I was younger,
I wanted to help people.

48:39.763 --> 48:42.965
Well, you do. I mean,
apps help people,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.634
- don't they?
- They can,

48:45.669 --> 48:48.971
but I'm worried the people who
turned down my app were right.

48:49.006 --> 48:52.408
I'm seeing how much my past has
colored the way I see Christmas.

48:52.443 --> 48:54.944
And now, being here
with you and Mike,

48:54.979 --> 48:57.746
and getting to be a part
of Christmas again,

48:57.815 --> 49:01.951
I'm just not sure what I'm
supposed to do with my life.

49:02.019 --> 49:05.254
Lucky for you, you're
surrounded by the peace

49:05.289 --> 49:07.957
and quiet of this place for
a few days. Maybe afterwards

49:08.025 --> 49:10.326
you'll feel
a little more clear.

49:10.361 --> 49:12.761
- Yeah, maybe.
- It's kind of simple.

49:12.796 --> 49:15.230
Just find out
the thing that you love

49:15.299 --> 49:19.268
and it'll all sort itself out.
Just follow your heart.

49:19.303 --> 49:21.736
That is a lot
of bumper stickers.

49:21.772 --> 49:23.872
I figure one of them
will stick.

49:23.907 --> 49:27.309
So, are you gonna
follow your heart?

49:27.345 --> 49:29.744
We're not talking
about me here.

49:29.780 --> 49:32.681
Maybe not,
but we should be.

49:36.887 --> 49:38.954
Alright. It's looking good.

49:38.990 --> 49:42.958
Yeah, it better, considering
it took us most of the day!

49:43.027 --> 49:46.661
Guess I still make
the best co-pilot, huh?

49:46.730 --> 49:50.032
I thought I was
your best co-pilot?

49:50.067 --> 49:52.101
You know what? I think I'm
gonna let you two guys

49:52.136 --> 49:54.870
battle this out.

49:54.905 --> 49:56.505
I got something I need
to take care of.

49:56.540 --> 49:58.507
Okay, see ya.

50:00.577 --> 50:03.445
- Came to see if you're hungry?
- Yes, starving.

50:03.481 --> 50:06.681
Oh, and I know where Uncle Harry
keeps the best snacks.

50:06.717 --> 50:08.783
- Really?
- Come on. Yeah.

50:10.721 --> 50:14.490
You ever wonder what our lives
would be like if I didn't move?

50:14.525 --> 50:16.925
Yeah, sometimes.

50:16.960 --> 50:19.861
Are you happy that you stayed?

50:19.897 --> 50:22.898
Yeah, I mean,
I went to the air force

50:22.933 --> 50:25.667
knowing I was gonna come back

50:25.702 --> 50:29.304
and raise a family. I just
came back a little sooner.

50:29.340 --> 50:33.409
Yeah, I guess I just
always imagined my life

50:33.444 --> 50:36.745
to look different. You know, I'd
like to get married one day,

50:36.813 --> 50:39.981
but can you imagine my dad
and Uncle Harry at a wedding?

50:40.051 --> 50:42.484
Not exactly the place
for a family reunion.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.586
And I certainly don't want
my kids growing up

50:44.621 --> 50:47.189
thinking families that
don't talk are normal.

50:47.224 --> 50:49.358
Well, what would you do
differently?

50:49.393 --> 50:52.594
For starters, I wouldn't be
afraid to tell my parents

50:52.629 --> 50:54.829
- that I'm here.
- They don't know you're here?

50:57.268 --> 50:59.601
Hey...

50:59.670 --> 51:03.238
It's okay that
you want to be here.

51:03.274 --> 51:07.209
And... I'm really glad
that you are.

51:07.278 --> 51:09.578
I am, too.

51:11.515 --> 51:13.949
Here's a crazy idea.

51:13.984 --> 51:16.851
What if we're meant to be here,
roasting chestnuts

51:16.887 --> 51:20.456
on an open fire,
and you being here

51:20.491 --> 51:23.892
is gonna, you know,
get your dad and Harry

51:23.961 --> 51:25.827
back together again?

51:25.896 --> 51:28.897
I love your hopeful optimism,
but that is very unlikely.

51:31.102 --> 51:33.034
Do you ever wish

51:33.070 --> 51:35.704
you could just go back in time
and change that moment?

51:39.076 --> 51:40.976
You mean the moment
when you left?

51:42.946 --> 51:44.846
Yeah.

51:44.881 --> 51:47.816
Yeah, I do.

51:47.851 --> 51:51.653
Life is a lot
out of our control,

51:51.688 --> 51:54.656
and we should
just be grateful

51:54.691 --> 51:58.693
about moments like this.

52:01.432 --> 52:04.533
- Oh, it's hot.
- Are you okay?

52:04.568 --> 52:07.436
- Yeah, I think so.
- Let me see.

52:08.739 --> 52:10.639
Mike?

52:10.674 --> 52:13.975
Uh, sorry to interrupt...

52:14.044 --> 52:16.678
that...
(laughing)

52:16.713 --> 52:20.015
- Scout's on the phone for you.
- Thanks, I'll be right there.

52:21.685 --> 52:24.153
(laughing)

52:24.188 --> 52:28.157
- I guess we better go, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

52:43.927 --> 52:47.562
Oh, sorry, the kitchen
is closed. Hi.

52:47.597 --> 52:50.932
Actually, I...
just came by to see you.

52:50.967 --> 52:53.401
Oh.

52:53.437 --> 52:56.471
Uh...

52:56.506 --> 52:59.740
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh yeah, that'd be nice.

53:01.678 --> 53:04.379
- How about a glass of your--
- I remember.

53:24.167 --> 53:26.767
- Oh. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53:29.239 --> 53:32.873
- Well... cheers.
- Cheers.

53:38.781 --> 53:41.549
- It's been a long time since--
- It was lovely hearing--

53:41.585 --> 53:45.886
- Ladies first.
- I was going to say,

53:45.922 --> 53:48.756
it's been a long time
since I've heard you play.

53:48.791 --> 53:52.527
And it was lovely hearing you.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.629
- It just brought back...
- A lot of memories?

53:54.664 --> 53:58.266
Yeah. Good ones.

54:00.203 --> 54:02.403

- Sleeping.

55:49.879 --> 55:52.913
- I was hoping to get your help.
- For the Gingerbread House?

55:52.949 --> 55:55.516
Actually, something different.
Meet me in the lobby in ten?

55:55.552 --> 55:58.018
Okay.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.760
(whistling)

56:05.795 --> 56:08.162
Hey, you started without me.

56:08.197 --> 56:11.399
Well, you're a little late.
I said ten minutes.

56:11.434 --> 56:14.001
I was only like
eleven minutes.

56:14.036 --> 56:15.903
Well, you look nice.

56:15.938 --> 56:19.940
Thank you.

56:19.976 --> 56:23.844
Wow, look at all these toys. The
kids are going to be so happy.

56:23.880 --> 56:28.249
Yeah. It's my favorite part
of Fly By Santa. The faces.

56:28.285 --> 56:30.851
- Thanks for helping.
- Oh, of course.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.820
I'm happy to. Please.

56:32.855 --> 56:35.556
It's all about
the giving, right?

56:35.592 --> 56:37.958
Well, lunch is on me.

56:39.929 --> 56:43.464
Alright, who am I kidding?
It's all about the receiving.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.368
(indistinct)

56:53.510 --> 56:55.777
- Amelia!
- Hi!

56:55.812 --> 56:57.945
Mike! Hi! Wow!

56:58.014 --> 57:00.881
I was just thinking about you.
I just filled a box

57:00.950 --> 57:03.250
with toys
for Fly By Santa.

57:03.286 --> 57:05.420
That is great. Thank you.

57:05.488 --> 57:09.424
- We're actually here for lunch.
- Well!

57:09.459 --> 57:12.593
- Well, sit anywhere you'd like.
- Great, thank you.

57:12.629 --> 57:14.562
Can I bring you
a glass of wine?

57:14.597 --> 57:16.431
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

57:16.499 --> 57:18.165
- Okay.
- Great.

57:18.201 --> 57:21.135
Is it just me,
or does Pamela

57:21.204 --> 57:24.639
- look happier than last time?
- Yeah, she sure does.

57:24.674 --> 57:27.342
What are you going to get?

57:27.377 --> 57:30.378
Oh. Um... maybe the steak?

57:30.447 --> 57:32.747
You're gonna get the steak
at an Italian restaurant?

57:32.782 --> 57:34.549
The steak is the right
choice in any restaurant,

57:34.584 --> 57:36.484
and it is amazing here,

57:36.519 --> 57:39.387
- for the record.
- Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

57:39.422 --> 57:41.789
Okay, here we go.

57:41.825 --> 57:44.726
That's for you. That's for you.

57:44.761 --> 57:48.128
- Have you had a chance to decide?
- Yes. I'll have the spaghetti.

57:48.164 --> 57:50.898
- Good choice.
- The steak. Medium.

57:50.933 --> 57:52.867
You got it.

57:52.902 --> 57:55.169
<i>- Skaal.
- Skaal.</i>

57:58.341 --> 58:02.042
- I love this place.
- I practically have a tab here.

58:02.078 --> 58:05.045
- Do you cook much?
- Yeah, a little.

58:05.114 --> 58:08.115
It's not so much fun
cooking on your own.

58:08.184 --> 58:12.787
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- I'm, uh... I'm officiating

58:12.822 --> 58:14.756
the Tree Lighting
tonight for fun.

58:14.824 --> 58:18.993
You could be my date--
I mean, if you want.

58:19.028 --> 58:22.530
Yeah, I would love to.

58:22.599 --> 58:24.899
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:24.934 --> 58:27.968
Okay. Be fun, right?

58:28.004 --> 58:30.971
Yeah, it will.

58:31.040 --> 58:34.141
I recommend heading into town
this afternoon for our Annual

58:34.176 --> 58:36.611
Tree Lighting and Gingerbread
House Contest.

58:36.646 --> 58:39.013
(buzzing sound)
Uh, excuse me.

58:46.756 --> 58:48.689
Hello?

58:48.725 --> 58:51.726
Uh, this is Nathan
from Hughes' Family Inn.

58:51.761 --> 58:54.762
Amelia? Uh, she's not here.

58:54.798 --> 58:57.197
Can I take a message?

59:00.403 --> 59:03.604
Maybe Harry can help you
with your concern.

59:03.640 --> 59:06.941
One moment, please.

59:07.009 --> 59:09.911
Hello? Hello?

59:09.946 --> 59:12.246
They hung up.

59:12.281 --> 59:14.782
- Whose phone is this?
- Amelia's.

59:19.055 --> 59:21.088
Oh, and I'm doing the final
toy pick-up tomorrow

59:21.123 --> 59:24.124
- before Fly By Santa, wanna join?
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

59:24.193 --> 59:26.627
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah.

59:26.663 --> 59:28.963
- Amelia, there you are.
- Uncle Harry,

59:28.998 --> 59:31.298
we just went into town for
lunch. Is everything okay?

59:31.334 --> 59:36.604
- Your phone was ringing.
- I left my phone here? Oops.

59:36.673 --> 59:40.374
Nathan answered it, he handed
the phone to me, and well...

59:42.011 --> 59:46.213
Mom and Dad called?
They know I'm here.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:02.675
[Hi there, you've
reached the Hughes.]

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.977
[We're not here right now.
Please leave a message.]

01:00:07.348 --> 01:00:10.583
Hey, everything okay?

01:00:10.618 --> 01:00:12.685
I tried calling.
They're not answering.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.187
I'm sure
everything is fine.

01:00:15.222 --> 01:00:17.289
Try not to jump to conclusions.

01:00:17.324 --> 01:00:19.224
Please don't tell me
not to jump to conclusions.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.126
I know my dad,
he's going to be upset.

01:00:21.161 --> 01:00:24.397
- What do I say?
- How about the truth?

01:00:24.432 --> 01:00:28.601
- Come on, we should get going.
- No,

01:00:28.636 --> 01:00:31.069
- I gotta check on Uncle Harry.
- Meels, are you okay?

01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:33.672
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I have to talk to Uncle Harry.

01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:39.812
I tried calling,

01:00:39.847 --> 01:00:42.882
- and they won't answer.
- Well, you're lucky.

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:45.818
They hung up on me before
I had a chance to say hello.

01:00:45.853 --> 01:00:50.022
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

01:00:50.057 --> 01:00:52.458
I don't know
what I was expecting.

01:00:52.493 --> 01:00:55.728
My brother has always
been stubborn.

01:00:55.797 --> 01:00:58.964
- Us Hughes are all stubborn.
- Yeah.

01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:03.969
I was rude to Mike.
And he left.

01:01:04.004 --> 01:01:06.238
I'm sure

01:01:06.273 --> 01:01:08.507
Mike understands.

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:10.543
My ex Brad says that I push
people away when I get upset.

01:01:10.578 --> 01:01:13.378
I have no idea
what that feels like.

01:01:13.448 --> 01:01:17.550
It must be
our family pattern.

01:01:17.585 --> 01:01:20.152
I'm pretty sure all my problems
are because of what happened

01:01:20.187 --> 01:01:22.855
all those years ago...
I lost you, and Mike, and--

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:26.425
You did not lose Mike, and
you certainly haven't lost me.

01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:30.028
I worry. Ever since then,
I don't really let people in.

01:01:30.064 --> 01:01:32.998
I'm not going anywhere,
Amelia, OK?

01:01:33.067 --> 01:01:35.568
Me neither, Uncle Harry.

01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:38.604
They called,
so what?

01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:41.907
I'm not gonna let it ruin
my night, are you?

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:45.778
- No, sir.
- Hm!

01:01:45.813 --> 01:01:49.482
(laughing)

01:01:49.517 --> 01:01:52.050
(festive music)

01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:16.074
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:19.879
- Brought you hot chocolate.
- Oh! You're sweet.

01:02:19.914 --> 01:02:21.881
Well, it's Christmas
and everything.

01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:24.316
Perfect timing. I was just
closing up shop.

01:02:24.351 --> 01:02:26.886
Yeah.

01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:30.923
Harry, what's going on?

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:34.226
Nothing, I'm....
you know, just drinking

01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:37.429
- hot chocolate...
- I mean...

01:02:37.464 --> 01:02:39.899
You know what I mean.

01:02:39.934 --> 01:02:42.001
Yeah.

01:02:43.938 --> 01:02:47.305
Look, I know I made
a lot of mistakes

01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:50.075
and...

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:53.378
the biggest mistake I made
was letting you walk away.

01:02:57.184 --> 01:02:59.618
I didn't fight
for our relationship,

01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:01.754
when I should have.

01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:06.091
I want to believe you,

01:03:06.126 --> 01:03:09.962
but I don't know if I can I
trust that things have changed.

01:03:09.997 --> 01:03:12.097
I get that. I do.

01:03:12.132 --> 01:03:14.433
But with Amelia home,

01:03:14.501 --> 01:03:18.537
we've had some... pretty
interesting conversations.

01:03:20.507 --> 01:03:23.976
I saw how much I was letting
my life pass by, and...

01:03:24.011 --> 01:03:27.245
I'm not willing
to do that anymore.

01:03:27.314 --> 01:03:30.783
I guess I was just so afraid
that you were going to leave me

01:03:30.818 --> 01:03:33.652
that I pushed you away first.

01:03:33.688 --> 01:03:37.522
So I don't blame you
for giving up on me.

01:03:39.526 --> 01:03:42.761
And I'm sorry
I hurt you the way I did.

01:03:45.499 --> 01:03:49.902
But you've always had my heart.

01:04:02.149 --> 01:04:06.752
- The mistletoe's a nice touch.
- I did it for the restaurant.

01:04:06.787 --> 01:04:08.988
Okay, maybe I was hopeful.

01:04:15.963 --> 01:04:19.264
Well, in that case,
will you be my date,

01:04:19.299 --> 01:04:23.936
- and join me in the Town Square?
- I would love to.

01:04:27.574 --> 01:04:31.209
- (bell jingling)
- Good evening, Christmas Creek!

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:34.479
My name Mike Ruggles
and I'm proud to officiate

01:04:34.548 --> 01:04:37.182
the Annual Tree Lighting

01:04:37.217 --> 01:04:39.885
and Gingerbread House Contest!
(cheers and applause)

01:04:41.989 --> 01:04:45.991
You know, there's a reason why
I've called this town my home

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.227
for almost 30 years,
and this year,

01:04:49.296 --> 01:04:52.931
you've outdone yourselves.
Everything looks amazing.

01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:55.433
So, without further ado,

01:04:55.469 --> 01:04:59.004
on the count of three,
let us light the tree!

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.240
One, two...

01:05:04.444 --> 01:05:08.413
Three!
(cheers and applause)

01:05:11.886 --> 01:05:14.153
Brilliant work, everybody!

01:05:14.188 --> 01:05:18.390
- Amelia!
- Elise, hi!

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:21.560
- Merry Christmas!
- So good to have you home.

01:05:21.595 --> 01:05:24.296
- Nice to see you.
- I'm gonna go to Scout.

01:05:24.331 --> 01:05:27.966
Alright, last chance to check
out the Gingerbread Houses

01:05:28.035 --> 01:05:32.437
and also get your vote in here.
We will tally the winner soon,

01:05:32.472 --> 01:05:36.208
and may the best house win!

01:05:43.884 --> 01:05:46.218
Hey...

01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:48.153
Hey.

01:05:48.189 --> 01:05:51.890
- I'm sorry about earlier, Mike.
- It's okay.

01:05:51.926 --> 01:05:55.160
No, it's not. I was pushing
you away. You didn't deserve it.

01:05:55.196 --> 01:05:57.529
I wasn't just trying
to make you feel better.

01:05:57.564 --> 01:06:00.999
I meant it. I know
everything's gonna be okay.

01:06:01.068 --> 01:06:05.070
I hope so. All I want for is
for my family rift to be healed,

01:06:05.139 --> 01:06:07.505
all of us to be happy.
This was the first Christmas

01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:09.742
I was actually
enjoying in a while,

01:06:09.777 --> 01:06:12.044
and now I'm just worried
about my parents.

01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:14.446
Don't lose hope, okay?

01:06:19.754 --> 01:06:23.288
(bell jingling)

01:06:23.323 --> 01:06:27.192
Duty calls.
(laughing)

01:06:27.228 --> 01:06:29.527
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

01:06:32.666 --> 01:06:37.102
Alright, folks, the votes
are in... and the winner

01:06:37.138 --> 01:06:40.505
of the Gingerbread House
Contest is... none other

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:44.977
than my very own niece,
Scout Redding!

01:06:45.012 --> 01:06:48.647
I had nothing to do
with the voting, I promise.

01:06:48.715 --> 01:06:51.483
Mom, can you take a photo

01:06:51.518 --> 01:06:55.287
- for Dad?
- Yes, yes. Ready?

01:06:58.793 --> 01:07:02.795
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Enjoy the festivities!

01:07:10.037 --> 01:07:12.204
<i>I'll never forget
the look on Scout's face</i>

01:07:12.239 --> 01:07:15.240
- for as long as I live.
- Hey, how about a cup

01:07:15.276 --> 01:07:17.176
- of hot apple cider?
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

01:07:17.244 --> 01:07:19.111
Mom, Dad?

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.815
- What're you doing here?
- We came for Christmas.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:26.985
- Danny?
- Hi, brother.

01:07:42.663 --> 01:07:44.864
- This cider's really good.
- Oh, thank you.

01:07:44.933 --> 01:07:48.734
It's a Hughes family recipe.
We used to make it as a family.

01:07:50.638 --> 01:07:53.105
The inn looks good.

01:07:53.174 --> 01:07:55.374
Thanks. We're all booked up,

01:07:55.443 --> 01:07:58.211
but I'm sure we can figure out
a place for you to stay.

01:07:58.246 --> 01:08:00.346
Actually, we had an early
check-out this morning,

01:08:00.381 --> 01:08:03.216
so I put them upstairs.
I hope that's okay?

01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:05.985
- Great. Put them on my bill.
- You don't have to pay for me,

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.454
- darling.
- Dad, please, I want to.

01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:11.891
We can take care
of our own bill.

01:08:11.926 --> 01:08:14.126
Alright, you guys,
if you want to get changed,

01:08:14.162 --> 01:08:17.830
- Christmas dinner's almost ready.
- Great.

01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:25.037
I know Christmas isn't
for two days, but we've got

01:08:25.106 --> 01:08:27.573
a lot of Christmases
to make up for, so I thought

01:08:27.608 --> 01:08:31.010
- we should start now.
- This is wonderful, thank you.

01:08:31.045 --> 01:08:34.747
- Everything looks delicious.
- Thank you, Helena

01:08:34.814 --> 01:08:37.783
and Pamela. Thank you.

01:08:37.818 --> 01:08:40.051
Growing up in Denmark,
my most precious memories

01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:43.455
were of the long smorgasbord
meals around the table.

01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:46.658
I've missed this... So here is

01:08:46.694 --> 01:08:48.995
to our family,
all together again.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:52.497
- Merry Christmas!<i> Skaal!</i>
- (all): <i> Skaal!</i>

01:08:59.173 --> 01:09:04.042
Well, I am grateful
to be included. Thank you.

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:06.779
Of course. You're family.
You've always been there for me

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:09.747
- and I really appreciate that.
- Is that supposed to mean

01:09:09.817 --> 01:09:12.751
I wasn't there for you?

01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:17.656
Well, those are
your words, not mine.

01:09:17.691 --> 01:09:20.826
You know, you can pretend
everything was fine,

01:09:20.861 --> 01:09:24.563
but you knew as well as I did
the inn was struggling.

01:09:24.598 --> 01:09:26.865
- I couldn't do it by myself.
- You weren't. We were partners.

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:29.301
Mom and Dad built this inn
so you and I could run this.

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:33.471
Except I did all the work! And
we could barely make ends meet,

01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:36.575
let alone support two families,
so I made a choice.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:38.676
- The one I had to make...
- You made the choice

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:40.813
of going all the way
across the country

01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:43.215
and becoming CFO
of some company?

01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.752
Will you both
please stop?

01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:49.921
Honey, why didn't you
tell us you were here,

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:53.158
spending Christmas
with my brother?

01:09:53.194 --> 01:09:55.727
I had to find out
from the bellman.

01:09:55.763 --> 01:09:58.831
Actually, I'm the front desk
clerk. Not important.

01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:00.899
Enjoy your dinner.

01:10:02.803 --> 01:10:06.038
I'm sorry.

01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:09.075
I didn't tell you because
I knew you would be upset.

01:10:09.143 --> 01:10:12.278
I had a right to come home.
Uncle Harry is my uncle.

01:10:12.313 --> 01:10:14.546
This isn't my feud, and I feel
like I've been in the middle

01:10:14.582 --> 01:10:17.016
of it my entire life.
I'm tired of it.

01:10:17.085 --> 01:10:19.218
- Honey.
- No. If we don't have

01:10:19.253 --> 01:10:21.954
each other, then what do we
have? Look at us. We're all...

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.923
adults and yet we're just
behaving like children.

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:28.494
Amelia! Honey, wait!

01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:34.666
Excuse me.

01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:43.342
Sorry.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.168
What are you doing?

01:11:09.237 --> 01:11:13.205
This is why I do Turks and
Caicos alone every Christmas

01:11:13.241 --> 01:11:15.908
instead of spending it with
family. I'll never be able

01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:18.244
- to fix this.
- Look, you're upset,

01:11:18.312 --> 01:11:20.746
I understand, but you don't have

01:11:20.781 --> 01:11:23.349
to leave.

01:11:23.384 --> 01:11:25.817
You can stay at my sister's
tonight. Let everyone cool off.

01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:28.587
You don't get it.
You don't know them like I do.

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:31.957
- It won't work.
- I'm just trying to help.

01:11:31.992 --> 01:11:34.226
I don't want your help.
I'm sorry.

01:11:34.262 --> 01:11:36.495
The Amelia I know wouldn't
walk away from her family

01:11:36.531 --> 01:11:39.231
when they need her most.
Please don't go.

01:11:41.536 --> 01:11:43.536
(sighing)

01:11:54.549 --> 01:11:57.583
Oh, uh, you guys are leaving?

01:11:57.618 --> 01:11:59.651
I think it's best.

01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:02.321
Harry, have you seen Amelia?
She won't answer our calls.

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.990
I think she was sleeping
this morning when I left.

01:12:05.025 --> 01:12:07.426
- Maybe she went into town?
- Well, now I'm worried.

01:12:07.462 --> 01:12:09.995
- I'm sure she's fine, Helena.
- I'm going to ask Nathan

01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:14.266
if he's seen or heard from her.

01:12:17.472 --> 01:12:20.005
You've been running this
all yourself?

01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:23.509
Uh, yes,
apart from Nathan.

01:12:23.544 --> 01:12:25.877
Hm. Who's
your accountant?

01:12:25.913 --> 01:12:29.014
I am. I had to learn.

01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:32.918
- You did a great job, Harry.
- I suppose

01:12:32.953 --> 01:12:35.621
you're gonna point out all the
ways in which I failed, yeah?

01:12:35.656 --> 01:12:39.492
I'm serious. Mom and
Dad would be proud.

01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:41.627
This is exactly
what they wanted.

01:12:41.662 --> 01:12:44.463
Thanks. That means
a lot coming from you.

01:12:44.532 --> 01:12:47.466
I lost my job

01:12:47.502 --> 01:12:49.435
in San Francisco,

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:53.172
which is why we moved to
Chicago. I gave them everything

01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:55.874
and they replaced me with a kid
fresh out of college.

01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:58.244
Danny, why didn't you
say anything?

01:12:58.312 --> 01:13:00.579
I was embarrassed, after
all we've been through...

01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:03.849
I tried to do right by my family
and now I'm jobless.

01:13:03.884 --> 01:13:07.953
Nathan said that Amelia's car
is gone. She left last night.

01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:20.065
Hey. Can I get you
another coffee?

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.801
I'm good. Hey, thank you for
letting me stay at your place

01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:25.904
last night. I just...
I needed some space.

01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:34.146
Loving the Hughes family
isn't always easy,

01:13:34.182 --> 01:13:37.449
but over the years,
I've learned

01:13:37.518 --> 01:13:40.952
that if you give them time,
eventually they come around.

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:43.189
I hope so.

01:13:43.224 --> 01:13:46.192
Oh, my friend Judy

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.260
took these at
the Tree Lighting.

01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:50.329
- Might cheer you up.
- Thanks, Pamela.

01:13:50.364 --> 01:13:52.097
Of course.

01:14:24.232 --> 01:14:27.999
- (ringing)
- [Amelia?]

01:14:28.068 --> 01:14:30.569
- [Well, this is a surprise.]
- Hi, Bill.

01:14:30.605 --> 01:14:32.771
I'm so sorry to bother you
on Christmas Eve.

01:14:32.806 --> 01:14:35.140
I just had a new take on the
Christmas app that I wanted

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:37.209
- to share with you right away.
- [Okay.]

01:14:37.245 --> 01:14:39.945
- [Well, I'm listening.]
- I'm thinking the app will be

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.581
a charity focused on bringing
people together, so that no one

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:46.118
has to celebrate Christmas
alone. It's about the gift

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:49.622
that matters most: Being present
rather than giving presents.

01:14:49.657 --> 01:14:51.890
[I like the sound
of that. I think]

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:55.527
[it's exactly what we're looking
for. After the holidays,]

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:58.297
[let's sit down
and talk specifics.]

01:14:58.366 --> 01:15:02.033
- I would love that. Thank you.
- [Thank you.]

01:15:02.102 --> 01:15:04.737
- [Oh! Merry Christmas.]
- Merry Christmas!

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:13.445
- You heading out?
- Yeah, I'm ready. What's this?

01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:15.947
I just got this
from the Fly By Santa run.

01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:18.083
Maybe you wouldn't mind
delivering these to Mike for me?

01:15:18.152 --> 01:15:20.886
Mike? Umm...

01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:23.989
Amelia... don't shut him out.

01:15:24.024 --> 01:15:27.359
Don't walk away from him like
I did Harry. You'll regret it,

01:15:27.395 --> 01:15:29.595
- trust me.
- You're right.

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:32.130
Thank you, Pamela.

01:15:34.168 --> 01:15:37.002
Mom? I'm okay.

01:15:37.037 --> 01:15:39.305
Can you all meet me in the cabin
in thirty minutes?

01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:48.458
- Amelia?
- I'm in here.

01:15:48.493 --> 01:15:52.595
- Honey, you're here.
- We were so worried!

01:15:52.664 --> 01:15:55.899
I know. I'm sorry.

01:15:55.934 --> 01:15:58.235
Wanna have a seat?

01:16:00.538 --> 01:16:02.939
The cabin looks
almost the same.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.341
Didn't really have
a reason to change it.

01:16:05.377 --> 01:16:07.477
Harry puts up stockings
for all the guests

01:16:07.512 --> 01:16:09.412
who stay at the inn
over Christmas

01:16:09.447 --> 01:16:12.048
because they have become
like family to him.

01:16:12.117 --> 01:16:14.951
I thought it was important to do
it for those who are my family.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.120
Since I've been here,

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:20.056
I've seen townspeople treat
neighbors like family

01:16:20.092 --> 01:16:22.859
and I was reminded what the
spirit of Christmas is about.

01:16:22.895 --> 01:16:25.295
It has nothing to do with gifts,

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.999
and everything to do with who
we spend our time with.

01:16:29.034 --> 01:16:32.368
There are people who have lost
their family and would do

01:16:32.404 --> 01:16:35.438
anything to spend time with them
again and here we are, a family,

01:16:35.473 --> 01:16:38.708
and we've turned on each other
when we needed one another most.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.580
Dad, you chose to leave

01:16:44.616 --> 01:16:46.983
because you thought it was
the best thing for your family.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.619
And Uncle Harry,
you took on the inn

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:52.088
and saved it from closure
without anyone else's help.

01:16:52.124 --> 01:16:54.424
You both had
the best intentions.

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:57.060
You both sacrificed
a part of your lives

01:16:57.095 --> 01:16:59.296
for something bigger than
yourselves. You're more the same

01:16:59.331 --> 01:17:02.232
than you are different.

01:17:02.267 --> 01:17:04.868
So why are you too stubborn
to see that?

01:17:04.937 --> 01:17:07.737
It makes me so sad.

01:17:07.772 --> 01:17:10.673
Love and family are truly
the most important things

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.608
in the world.

01:17:12.644 --> 01:17:15.745
That's what Christmas Creek
and this inn is all about.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.381
If we don't have
each other,

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.583
then what do we have?

01:17:27.326 --> 01:17:30.327
At last!
(laughing)

01:17:34.032 --> 01:17:37.200
Thank you, honey,
for coming back

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:39.236
to the inn and bringing us
back together.

01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:42.705
- I'm so glad that you came.
- I'm sorry for keeping you

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.608
from your uncle and
from Christmas Creek.

01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:48.711
I know a lot of this
was my fault.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:52.282
Yeah, kinda, but it was
also my fault, too.

01:17:52.317 --> 01:17:54.617
You know, I managed
this place without you,

01:17:54.686 --> 01:17:58.721
and it wasn't easy and it wasn't
always fun. There happens to be

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:02.225
a job opening that's
presented itself. CFO.

01:18:02.294 --> 01:18:05.262
If you want your old job back,
we can run this inn

01:18:05.297 --> 01:18:08.064
the way Mom and Dad
intended, as a family.

01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:12.235
That is, if you're
looking for work.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:15.105
I've never wanted
anything more.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.873
But you know,

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:19.910
I do have a few ideas on how
we could streamline things.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:23.113
OK, feel free to leave them in
the suggestion box in the lobby.

01:18:23.148 --> 01:18:26.016
(laughing)

01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:29.286
Um, you know what? If you
don't mind, there is someplace

01:18:29.354 --> 01:18:32.455
that I really need to be.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:34.624
You know,
before you go,

01:18:34.659 --> 01:18:37.560
I've got a little
proposition for you.

01:18:40.732 --> 01:18:44.634
Merry Christmas.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:47.437
Baseball bat! Thank you.

01:18:47.505 --> 01:18:50.773
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.977
Meels?

01:18:54.012 --> 01:18:56.246
- You're here...
- Pamela asked me

01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:59.049
to give this to you.

01:18:59.084 --> 01:19:01.818
Mike,

01:19:01.853 --> 01:19:04.720
I'm so sorry.
I never left.

01:19:04.756 --> 01:19:07.924
I couldn't, because you're
right. It's not who I am.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.361
All that matters to me
are the people I love.

01:19:11.396 --> 01:19:13.964
My family is going to be okay.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:16.766
And the only person that
I wanted to tell was you.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:19.635
Mike, you always were

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.038
my best friend,
the person who had my back,

01:19:22.074 --> 01:19:25.375
but now you are
so much more than that.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:29.579
You are the brightest light
I know. I can't lose you again.

01:19:29.647 --> 01:19:33.850
I love you, Mike Ruggles.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.596
That was--

01:19:46.664 --> 01:19:49.265
- A lot, I know.
- Amazing.

01:19:49.301 --> 01:19:52.435
I've been waiting
17 years to do that.

01:19:52.471 --> 01:19:54.304
So have I.

01:19:54.339 --> 01:19:57.374
I love you, Meels.

01:19:57.409 --> 01:19:59.775
I always have.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.816
- That is a lot of presents.
- Yeah.

01:20:06.851 --> 01:20:11.554
I hope Harry's okay with an
extra-large delivery tonight.

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:13.756
Actually, Harry wanted
to take the night off,

01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:15.691
so I said that we would
do Fly By Santa.

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:18.794
What do you think?

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:21.764
I think that would be awesome.
Come on, help me pack it up.

01:20:21.799 --> 01:20:22.999
Okay.

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:26.602
Oh boy, this feels
like Christmas.

01:20:29.508 --> 01:20:33.343
- Dad? He's here. Mom, look!
- Hey!

01:20:33.378 --> 01:20:36.546
- Scout! Oh!
- I can't believe you're here!

01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:39.482
I can't believe you're home!

01:20:39.518 --> 01:20:41.418
I thought you weren't
gonna make it.

01:20:41.453 --> 01:20:43.853
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.824
I love you so much.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.194
How many deliveries
do we make?

01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:53.296
Just the two
neighboring towns.

01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:56.066
They only have access by plane.

01:20:58.002 --> 01:21:01.704
So, you ready, Mrs. Claus?

01:21:01.739 --> 01:21:04.974
Um, not yet.

01:21:05.009 --> 01:21:07.510
Merry Christmas, Mike.

01:21:07.546 --> 01:21:10.513
All this time and...
not much has changed.

01:21:10.582 --> 01:21:14.417
Yet everything has.
(laughing)

01:21:17.589 --> 01:21:20.022
It's perfect.

01:21:20.058 --> 01:21:23.626
Thank you. My turn.

01:21:27.365 --> 01:21:32.502
I've been holding onto this
for a long time.

01:21:32.537 --> 01:21:35.572
You left before I could
give it to you that night.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:45.982
- A Christmas Angel!
- You'll always be my Angel.

01:21:46.017 --> 01:21:48.684
I love it, Mike.
Thank you.

01:21:50.288 --> 01:21:53.356
You know, we'll see each
other, we'll figure it out.

01:21:53.391 --> 01:21:57.827
You can fly to me
and I'll fly to you--

01:22:04.236 --> 01:22:07.036
I'm not worried.

01:22:07.071 --> 01:22:10.273
We found each other again,
and I'm not letting you go.

01:22:16.248 --> 01:22:20.183
- Remember how to fly this thing?
- Um, yes.

01:22:20.218 --> 01:22:24.720
- Uncle Harry already took me up.
- Oh, he did?

01:22:24.756 --> 01:22:26.922
Well, come on, then.

01:22:29.661 --> 01:22:31.927
Watch your step. There you go.

01:22:33.632 --> 01:22:36.332
Now,

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:39.769
- are you ready, Mrs. Claus?
- With you, Ruggles... always.

01:22:39.804 --> 01:22:42.838
