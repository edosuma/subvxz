WEBVTT

00:11.209 --> 00:12.879
What did I tell you, Mannetti?

00:13.099 --> 00:16.539
The cream always rises... to the cop!

00:19.979 --> 00:21.489
Who writes this stuff?

00:21.549 --> 00:24.289
Tonight, and tonight only, at the City Arena Center,

00:24.289 --> 00:27.519
it's Double R-W's Wrassle Frassle VII live!

00:27.749 --> 00:30.929
Come watch all your favorites battle it out for the championship belt!

00:30.929 --> 00:33.349
It's really real wrestling at its best!

00:33.349 --> 00:34.099
Tonight at 8!

00:34.099 --> 00:36.279
For tickets, call your momma and cry about it

00:36.279 --> 00:37.989
because this event is sold out!

00:38.719 --> 00:40.479
I can't believe we didn't get tickets.

00:40.479 --> 00:43.039
Dude, I told you we should of left early to stand in line,

00:43.039 --> 00:45.539
but no, you wanted to finish your work.

00:45.539 --> 00:48.309
Dude, Benson would have snapped his crank if we just left work.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.249
You gotta be responsible sometimes.

00:50.249 --> 00:52.289
And that's why we don't have tickets for wrestling,

00:52.289 --> 00:54.359
because all you can think about is Benson's crank.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.799
Oh! You're asking for it man!

00:56.799 --> 00:58.259
You're asking for it, man!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.529
You trying to get me mad?

00:59.529 --> 01:01.449
You know what happen when I get mad!

01:01.449 --> 01:02.689
Oh, I know.

01:07.629 --> 01:09.459
Listen up, Mysterious Mr. R!

01:09.459 --> 01:11.459
Mad Man Mordo's gonna take you down!

01:11.459 --> 01:14.989
And I'm not talking downtown, I'm talking six feet underground!

01:16.249 --> 01:17.799
Mad Man Mordo?

01:17.799 --> 01:19.989
More like Bland Man Bored-o!

01:19.989 --> 01:21.529
When I'm through with you, people will be all like

01:21.529 --> 01:23.649
"Ah, what happened to his face?!", and I'll be like,

01:23.649 --> 01:26.429
"Mysterious Mr. R is what happened to his face!"

01:26.429 --> 01:27.209
That's it!

01:51.749 --> 01:53.609
Dude, Pops, chill! Let him go!

01:55.039 --> 01:57.459
Oh I just love to wrestle!

01:58.269 --> 02:01.039
That wasn't wrestling! You were actually hurting me!

02:01.119 --> 02:02.789
Yeah, Pops, what's your problem?

02:02.789 --> 02:05.179
Wrestling's totally fake! You weren't doing it right!

02:05.549 --> 02:09.059
Uh, fake? No. no, no, I assure you, it's real.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.609
I used to wrestle back in my schooling days.

02:12.089 --> 02:13.679
Look, here I am.

02:13.679 --> 02:17.359
We learned how to wrestle just like the Greckos and the Romans!

02:17.359 --> 02:19.389
Whoa, cool!

02:19.509 --> 02:21.829
Oh, I'm so glad you think so!

02:21.829 --> 02:25.959
Because I thought you two might want to accompany me to... this!

02:26.819 --> 02:30.499
Double R-W Wrassle Frassle VII?! You got tickets?!

02:30.499 --> 02:32.189
Pops. you're a legend!

02:32.189 --> 02:35.269
Really Real Wrestling! Really Real Wrestling!

02:35.269 --> 02:38.669
Really Real Wrestling! Really Real Wrestling!

02:38.669 --> 02:41.149
You gotta teach us some of your moves, Pops!

02:41.229 --> 02:43.779
Okay, I Will go easy on you boys this time.

02:44.239 --> 02:45.029
And go!

02:46.489 --> 02:47.739
Impressive, Pops!

02:47.749 --> 02:49.539
But you forgot about this!

02:49.539 --> 02:50.399
Rigby!

02:55.749 --> 02:57.379
My back!

02:57.379 --> 02:58.319
Hey, do you guys--

02:58.579 --> 03:00.409
Pops! What happened, are you OK?

03:00.499 --> 03:04.249
Yes, yes, all is fine. Just not as limber as I used to be.

03:04.379 --> 03:06.809
What have I told you about wrestling?!

03:06.899 --> 03:08.489
Sorry, we didn't mean to!

03:08.489 --> 03:11.049
Yeah, come on, Pops! Shake it off, you gotta take us to Wrassle Frassle!

03:11.049 --> 03:13.439
What? No! He Isn't going anywhere.

03:13.439 --> 03:16.259
Pops can't even get up. He needs to take it easy.

03:16.339 --> 03:18.139
No, no. I can get up.

03:21.059 --> 03:22.749
But Pops already got his tickets!

03:22.749 --> 03:24.869
It's the biggest wrestling event of the year!

03:24.869 --> 03:25.789
I don't care.

03:25.949 --> 03:28.999
Wait, Benson, surely we can all still go!

03:29.979 --> 03:32.119
I am sorry, Pops. Its not gonna happen.

03:32.119 --> 03:34.119
You have to stay home for your own good.

03:34.249 --> 03:35.589
Oh, boo.

03:35.709 --> 03:39.589
Now help Pops upstairs, and don't even think of leaving him alone!

03:39.589 --> 03:42.019
Because if you leave, don't bother coming back!

03:42.019 --> 03:43.489
Fine. We get it.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.369
Does that one get it?! Cause sometimes I wonder!

03:46.369 --> 03:49.309
I get it, I get it. Watch out for Pops and don't go to wrestling.

03:50.699 --> 03:51.189
Good!

03:53.779 --> 03:56.579
Why are we going to bed so early?

03:56.629 --> 03:59.089
It's the easiest way to make sure you don't get hurt again.

03:59.179 --> 04:00.829
Yeah, sleep is the best medicine.

04:00.929 --> 04:02.759
I thought laughter was the best medicine.

04:02.819 --> 04:04.299
Not when you're telling the jokes.

04:04.329 --> 04:05.609
Pfft, whatever.

04:05.659 --> 04:07.089
You wanna hear a joke Pops?

04:07.109 --> 04:09.069
I better get some rest.

04:11.769 --> 04:12.769
Good night, Pops.

04:13.049 --> 04:15.079
Sleep speed to all.

04:25.459 --> 04:26.489
Mordecai, come on!

04:27.479 --> 04:28.159
What?

04:28.249 --> 04:30.269
Come on, let's sneak out and go to Wrassle Frassle!

04:30.269 --> 04:30.829
What?

04:31.649 --> 04:32.849
What about Pops?

04:32.849 --> 04:35.039
He needs his rest anyways. He'll be fine.

04:35.039 --> 04:37.099
- You sure he's asleep? - Yeah, look.

04:37.429 --> 04:39.049
Pops. Pops.

05:11.749 --> 05:15.439
Row Z, seats 97, 98 and 99!

05:15.509 --> 05:18.219
Man, we made it! This is awesome!

05:18.299 --> 05:20.419
So close to the action!

05:24.219 --> 05:25.499
One, two, three!

05:28.029 --> 05:29.859
See man, we couldn't have missed this!

05:29.859 --> 05:31.459
Totally worth sneaking out!

05:31.459 --> 05:32.369
Totally.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.279
Still though, it's pretty lame Pops couldn't be here.

05:35.529 --> 05:37.079
Don't worry, man! We did the right thing.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.969
Pops is totally safe back home in his bed.

05:42.649 --> 05:44.489
Hey, bro! Ladder Match is about to start!

05:44.489 --> 05:46.239
Where's that new wrestler, Huge Head?

05:46.329 --> 05:48.639
Eh, I don't know. He hasn't shown up yet.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.049
Did you call him?

06:00.049 --> 06:02.319
Yeah, I called him! What, do you think I'm a moron?

06:02.319 --> 06:03.459
Hey, who's this?

06:04.309 --> 06:05.059
Hello!

06:05.059 --> 06:06.429
Yeah, this is him, right?

06:06.429 --> 06:08.779
He's gotta be. Look at the size of that thing!

06:08.909 --> 06:10.579
Hey Huge Head, you're late!

06:10.659 --> 06:14.039
Oh, I am sorry. Would you mind helping me inside?

06:14.109 --> 06:16.469
- What? - His dramatic enterance!

06:16.609 --> 06:17.779
Oh yeah, sure.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.779
Okay, get ready folks, because it's time for the main event!

06:21.779 --> 06:23.749
The Ladder Match!

06:27.949 --> 06:31.699
Who's gonna be the one to reach the championship belt at the top of the ladder?

06:31.699 --> 06:34.559
Will it be... The Fire Marshall?!

06:35.289 --> 06:36.659
Hissy Fit?!

06:37.479 --> 06:40.979
The leading champion, Four Arm-ageddon?!

06:42.519 --> 06:43.649
Come on!

06:43.649 --> 06:47.139
Or, making his Double R-W Wrassle Frassle debut,

06:47.139 --> 06:50.219
give it up for... Huge Head!

06:54.359 --> 06:55.889
Look at that guy's head!

06:55.889 --> 06:58.379
That guy's head is almost as big as Pops!

06:58.459 --> 06:59.999
It is as big as Pops!

07:00.569 --> 07:02.059
Dude, that is Pops!

07:02.059 --> 07:03.539
What?! How did heâ€"what?!

07:03.539 --> 07:05.189
Dude, he's gonna be pummelled! Come on!

07:06.539 --> 07:08.149
Pops, what are you doing here?!

07:08.249 --> 07:12.139
Mordecai, Rigby, I thought you two were back at home sleeping!

07:12.139 --> 07:15.099
Looks like we both couldn't stay away!

07:15.099 --> 07:16.769
Pops, we gotta get you out of here.

07:16.839 --> 07:18.189
But I just got here!

07:18.189 --> 07:21.749
And look, I got here late, and they upgraded my seat!

07:21.749 --> 07:23.809
No, Pops! They think you're a wrestler!

07:23.809 --> 07:25.759
But I am a wrestler!

07:25.899 --> 07:28.339
And besides, you said all this was fake.

07:28.339 --> 07:30.539
Fake?! Who said this was fake?!

07:30.669 --> 07:31.699
They did!

07:33.129 --> 07:34.319
Is this fake?!

07:36.999 --> 07:38.589
How about you, little dude?

07:38.589 --> 07:40.589
Does this seem fake to you?!

07:41.799 --> 07:42.449
No.

07:42.449 --> 07:45.799
Why do you think it's called "Really Real Wrestling"?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.069
Cause it's real!

07:47.069 --> 07:49.309
Okay, we were wrong. We're sorry.

07:49.359 --> 07:51.269
Yeah, just let us take our friend and go!

07:51.269 --> 07:53.169
"Sorry" doesn't cut it!

07:53.169 --> 07:56.149
There are only two ways you guys are getting outta here.

07:56.149 --> 08:01.339
In a bodybag, or by beating all of us in the Ladder Match!

08:02.849 --> 08:03.909
Listen up!

08:03.939 --> 08:08.529
Huge Head and his friends here think all this is fake!

08:10.839 --> 08:15.199
Whaddya say, we teach him how real this really is?!

08:19.359 --> 08:20.649
Come on!

08:20.649 --> 08:24.249
You better get in the ring, or we're coming out after you!

08:24.689 --> 08:26.759
Okay, Rigby and I are gonna go in after the bell.

08:26.759 --> 08:28.019
Stay here, Pops.

08:28.019 --> 08:30.739
- But I can help! - No! Stay here!

08:33.318 --> 08:35.849
Dude, I'll distract him. You get to the ladder.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.389
You like it yet?

09:19.869 --> 09:20.709
Pops!

09:26.559 --> 09:28.639
Who wants to wrestle?!

09:47.429 --> 09:48.909
Real enough for you?

09:53.649 --> 09:58.679
And the winner, Huge Head!

10:08.409 --> 10:09.429
I knew it! I had a sick feeling,

10:09.429 --> 10:12.819
I had a sick feeling, so I came to check on you, and I knew it!

10:12.819 --> 10:13.919
Wait, listen, Benson!

10:13.919 --> 10:16.689
No! You guys are fired! That's it!

10:16.689 --> 10:17.709
Wait, what? Come on!

10:17.709 --> 10:20.709
No! I Thought I told you guys, but you didn't wanna listen!

10:20.709 --> 10:22.599
Come on, Pops! You gotta help us!

10:22.699 --> 10:24.359
I cannot tell a lie.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.759
Benson, it was all my fault.

10:26.759 --> 10:27.349
What?

10:27.489 --> 10:30.019
I snuck out to the wrestling match on my own,

10:30.019 --> 10:32.739
and Mordecai and Rigby had to come and get me.

10:32.879 --> 10:33.949
I'm sorry.

10:34.029 --> 10:37.099
Yeah. Most of that is technically true, somewhat, so...

10:37.099 --> 10:39.099
Plus look, Pops' back is all better.

10:39.099 --> 10:40.249
It's true!

10:40.659 --> 10:42.539
Thats your last warning.

10:43.419 --> 10:45.589
Wow. Thanks for taking the blame, Pops.

10:46.549 --> 10:48.549
I'm just glad it's over.

10:48.549 --> 10:51.309
Yeah. Time for bed, Huge Head.

10:51.309 --> 10:52.819
Yeah, Huge Head!

10:52.889 --> 10:55.129
So you think you can steal my name, huh?!

10:55.239 --> 10:58.339
Well, let's see how you like it if I steal yours... Pops!
