01:52.458 --> 01:53.479
Thank you.

01:57.708 --> 01:58.813
Thank you.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.896
- Do I have to make a speech?
- Yes, Nils. You really do.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.104
- How fine you are.
- Thank you.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.104
Hello.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.563
Yes, there it was.
Better get dressed.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.354
Ingvar...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Stop!

05:07.292 --> 05:08.437
Shit!

05:21.417 --> 05:23.646
<i>I'm not great speaker but...</i>

05:24.333 --> 05:28.479
<i>It is a great honor
to be nominated for this year's citizen.</i>

05:30.292 --> 05:36.188
<i>But it is strange to get a price
for doing what you like.</i>

05:40.292 --> 05:44.312
<i>I'm just a man who keeps
a strip of civilization open …</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:47.688
<i>… through the wilderness.</i>

05:54.500 --> 05:57.646
<i>When I was a kid
I liked Indian books …</i>

05:58.333 --> 06:02.813
<i>- and you can say I have become
a kind of… pathfinder.</i>

06:06.250 --> 06:09.521
<i>Even though I find
the same path again and again.</i>

06:13.125 --> 06:14.979
<i>Yes…</i>

06:15.667 --> 06:17.854
<i>Yes, thank you so much.</i>

07:01.125 --> 07:03.938
That's good.
It was really nice.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.188
Very good.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.521
You were so funny yesterday.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.938
It was a nice trip.

07:14.125 --> 07:17.729
That's fine.
Have fun. And say hello.

08:12.042 --> 08:15.938
- So it's the new snow blower?
- Yes.

08:19.417 --> 08:22.271
It is a thumping big one.

08:22.958 --> 08:25.438
Damn it.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.520
You…
Do you hear anything?

08:38.500 --> 08:41.770
It's The Center Party,
calling on you.

08:43.542 --> 08:48.021
You are a success, Nils.
It's no secret.

08:48.708 --> 08:52.521
You have shown it is possible to succeed
even if you don't come from Norway.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.354
We need people like you.

08:56.042 --> 08:59.646
A successful
fully integrated immigrant.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.854
And "immigrant", it is well meant
in this context.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.062
Well, we're fine,
Gail and me.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.604
I am probably best at
minding my own business.

09:13.292 --> 09:15.854
Yes. Yes, yes, yes... No.

09:17.458 --> 09:21.938
If all had that attitude
we wouldn't have a democracy.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.563
- The diploma has to hang somewhere.
- Yes.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.604
It could fit here.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.521
Hold this, please?

11:33.125 --> 11:35.188
Is it him?

11:35.875 --> 11:38.854
Yes. An overdose...

11:53.167 --> 11:55.813
It is this and that one...
And this is important.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.479
Ingvar was not a drug addict.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.448
It what all parents says, unfortunately.

12:16.917 --> 12:19.521
Ingvar was not a drug addict.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.521
What are you going to do?

12:29.500 --> 12:32.896
It's difficult to do anything…

12:34.958 --> 12:37.604
about young people
destroying themselves.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.813
You don't intend to do anything.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.688
We didn't know our own son.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.729
He was a drug addict,
and we knew nothing.

13:02.292 --> 13:04.188
Nothing.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.521
Ingvar lies dead in there
of an overdose.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.979
Ingvar was not a drug addict.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.896
Do you hear?

15:31.292 --> 15:32.771
Nils?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.604
Finn?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.854
Sorry.

15:39.542 --> 15:45.563
Sorry. It was not
supposed to end like this.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.729
I just wanted to borrow it...

15:52.750 --> 15:54.438
I work for them.

15:55.125 --> 16:01.063
I know when and where the cocaine is
coming, and I drive around.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.563
I just wanted to borrow it.

16:05.500 --> 16:09.938
And Ingvar… It's true,
he knew nothing.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.688
He did me a great service,
but he knew nothing.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.146
And now they want to take me.

16:17.583 --> 16:21.021
Because it's my fault.
So it's quite okay.

16:21.708 --> 16:27.354
But I just thought that if
a single bag disappears…

16:28.042 --> 16:30.938
…they probably wouldn't notice,
who took it.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.229
But they always find out,
those people.

16:34.917 --> 16:39.813
- What are those people?
- I don't think you want to know.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.646
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.479
What are those people?

16:47.250 --> 16:50.479
Do you have any money?
I have to go to Sweden.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.604
What are those people?

16:55.292 --> 16:58.521
Jappe is the only
I have had contact with.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.938
I only know Jappe.

17:01.625 --> 17:07.146
Now you tell me where I can find
Jappe. And then you disappear from here.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.604
Jappe?

18:33.792 --> 18:35.771
Greetings from Finn.

18:37.542 --> 18:40.771
- I don't know any Finn.
- Yes, you do.

18:41.458 --> 18:45.104
You know my son Ingvar.
He works on the airfield.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.354
I know many people.

18:51.250 --> 18:56.437
Go home to your village.
And then stay there. It's safe and sound.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.771
Okay?

19:10.125 --> 19:11.812
Goddamn it!

19:12.917 --> 19:15.229
I want to know
what happened to him.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.646
I want to know
what happened to him.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.438
I just got the message.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.146
By whom?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.604
Ronaldo.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.646
Ronaldo said
that they had taken something from us.

20:22.333 --> 20:27.354
I was told to fix this shit.
Make it look like an overdose.

20:30.292 --> 20:34.271
- Ronaldo… is this him?
- Yes.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.938
Rune, everything okay?

22:04.667 --> 22:06.146
Okay?

22:08.083 --> 22:10.979
- It's just… Jonathan
- What about him?

22:18.417 --> 22:20.313
What is happening here?

22:22.875 --> 22:26.604
- It's just Jonathan.
- What's with him?

22:31.292 --> 22:33.354
He bully me.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.979
Aha, what do you do about it?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.687
Rune... Rune.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.521
It's not a problem.

22:46.208 --> 22:50.271
Jonathan bully you,
because he thinks you're weak, right?

22:51.792 --> 22:54.938
So you just show him
that is not the case.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.521
You…

22:58.208 --> 23:01.063
- Do you want me to beat him?
- Yes, for example.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.354
You…

23:05.042 --> 23:07.771
But you're not supposed to.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.896
It's not all,
you need to think too hard about. You…

23:13.208 --> 23:17.938
- He is big.
- Rune, then you just crack.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.021
But then I just as stupid
as he is.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.229
Jappe disappeared.

23:51.042 --> 23:53.104
Who is Jappe?

23:55.667 --> 23:58.938
Jappe is one of my employees.
You know what?

23:59.625 --> 24:02.313
There is something
not quite right here.

24:03.917 --> 24:08.354
Didn't we agreed not to talk
business on the way to school?

24:09.042 --> 24:11.438
Wasn't that what we agreed?

24:12.667 --> 24:13.813
Yes.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.521
Did you remember the fruit?

24:17.708 --> 24:21.396
He must have five different kinds of
organic fruit and vegetables every day.

24:24.792 --> 24:26.604
Didn't we talked about it before?

24:27.292 --> 24:28.979
- Yes.
- Yes, we have.

24:29.667 --> 24:32.479
Rune? So there will be
no fruit today…

24:33.167 --> 24:35.271
…and I am truly sorry.

24:35.958 --> 24:39.063
I hope you see,
I'm innocent in this matter.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.896
Have a good day, Dad.

24:53.583 --> 24:57.104
You… Now remember what I said.
You just…

24:59.750 --> 25:02.604
LAPD!
It is quite insane.

25:03.292 --> 25:06.979
It's like on TV.
There are shootings. The Wild West.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.229
Twice they have
tried to shoot him.

25:10.917 --> 25:14.188
The one time they ripped his foot.
It went fine, but…

25:14.875 --> 25:18.104
It is quite sick.
I got this mug from him.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.271
"To serve and protect".

25:36.375 --> 25:39.021
You can get out.
You'll survive.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.688
Next time you go out.

25:57.417 --> 26:01.729
- Who is it?
- Nils Dickman. Citizen Of The Year.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.938
It's a damn lie!
Dickman?

26:05.625 --> 26:07.979
Poor thing was
unlucky with the name.

26:23.167 --> 26:25.729
Are not you gonna ask
where I've been?

28:16.458 --> 28:19.604
Who told you and Jappe
to kill Finn and Ingvar?

28:22.208 --> 28:25.771
Strike said it should
be taken care of.

28:27.583 --> 28:30.188
And they were not
just to disappear.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.354
If Norwegian children just disappear…

28:34.042 --> 28:39.604
…there's always some damn troublesome
parents who are looking for them.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.729
Where do I find Strike?

28:50.083 --> 28:52.313
Where do I find Strike?

29:05.292 --> 29:08.271
- Airport.
- He works at the airport?

29:08.958 --> 29:11.563
He flies the coke in
and the money out.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.271
Is this him?

29:17.667 --> 29:19.604
Good.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.313
You are a dead man.

30:38.127 --> 30:40.370
It's the fourth gym suit you lost.

30:40.917 --> 30:44.938
Why do you think that happens, Marit?
Because I have a job, right?

30:45.625 --> 30:50.021
I'm trying to make money, so we can
afford to buy a gym suit.

30:51.292 --> 30:55.604
Now you take these
and buy as much gym suits…

30:56.292 --> 31:00.438
…you have a new set for each
fucking gymnastics lesson in his life.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.604
Have a nice day.

31:04.475 --> 31:05.555
I've talked with my lawyer…

31:05.792 --> 31:10.146
…and we propose a new scheme in which he
stays ten days with me and four with you.

31:10.833 --> 31:13.729
A week with me, a week with you.
That's the deal.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.630
It's confusing for him.
He needs a base…

31:17.225 --> 31:18.265
…a home where
he feels safe

31:18.792 --> 31:21.146
Well he can be here all the time.

31:24.104 --> 31:25.423
That'll never work

31:26.831 --> 31:28.511
We both know what
kind of a father you are.

31:30.949 --> 31:32.469
You give him Fruit Loops
for breakfast.

31:32.875 --> 31:35.979
What the hell are you saying?
Froot Loops?

31:36.667 --> 31:40.854
I am vegan, Marit! He has not gotten
none e-number in this house…

31:41.542 --> 31:44.438
…since you filled him up
with cheap baby porridge!

31:48.333 --> 31:51.104
- Is this a bad time?
- Oh no.

31:51.792 --> 31:56.229
I just discuss Froot Loops
and gym suits with my son's mother.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.979
We're just enjoying ourselves.

31:59.593 --> 32:00.673
My lawyer will be in touch.

32:01.417 --> 32:06.396
Interesting that you take it up, for
I want to talk a little with you about it.

32:07.792 --> 32:12.896
Which of us do you think you can afford
the most expensive lawyer?

32:21.708 --> 32:25.354
- What the hell is it now?
- Ronaldo has disappeared.

33:03.208 --> 33:07.188
Relax. He's not here.
Don't worry.

33:34.958 --> 33:36.146
Who are you?

33:41.917 --> 33:42.917
Nils.

36:40.125 --> 36:44.229
There is not room for both of us.
There is a turning space back there.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.188
Ill try that.

36:53.292 --> 36:55.896
You don't have the seat belts on.

37:12.417 --> 37:15.604
Are you really aware
who you're fucking with here?

37:16.292 --> 37:17.563
Tell.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.646
Who is it?

37:27.042 --> 37:28.688
You are so done.

37:38.625 --> 37:39.896
Who is it?

37:55.750 --> 37:58.021
Well, are you're tired now, old man?

38:00.042 --> 38:01.042
Yes.

39:20.875 --> 39:24.813
One thing is my cocaine.
Fifteen kilos of raw cocaine.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.062
It is what it is.

39:27.750 --> 39:32.146
It's something different with my people.
One man, maybe two may disappear.

39:32.833 --> 39:37.146
But three man can damn not disappear,
without someone causing them to disappear.

39:40.875 --> 39:43.646
Someone is after my people
and my territories.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.729
And it is not hard to guess who.

39:47.417 --> 39:49.813
- The fucking Albanians.
- Serbs.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.563
We shared Oslo with them, right?
We shared southern Norway, city by city.

39:56.250 --> 39:59.438
They even got
the fatty oil pigs in Stavanger.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.646
They were allowed
to use the airfield…

40:03.333 --> 40:08.063
…so they could land their shit.
In peaceful coexistence.

40:08.750 --> 40:12.396
- I have been incredibly nice.
- Too nice.

40:13.083 --> 40:16.604
And this is the thanks.
This is how they thank me.

40:17.292 --> 40:22.229
The land with drug several times a week.
Go up there. Get one of them.

40:22.917 --> 40:24.521
Get me one of them.

40:25.208 --> 40:29.104
- Do you know what he looks like?
- No, but don't you think we'll know?

40:33.750 --> 40:37.438
Why the hell do we get all that snow?
I don't know how we stand it.

40:38.125 --> 40:41.146
- It's snowing all the time.
- It's the welfare.

40:45.625 --> 40:49.229
There isn't any hot country
that has welfare.

40:49.917 --> 40:54.729
When the weather is great
you do not need a welfare state.

40:55.417 --> 40:57.938
Then you gather a banana
and is done with it.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.813
- What's happening?
- It's the snow.

41:19.125 --> 41:23.479
In Bali, Thailand, Vietnam…
people has to fend for themselves.

41:24.750 --> 41:28.521
Spain is on the ass.
Portugal is on the ass.

41:29.208 --> 41:33.604
Greece is on the ass. Italy is
on the ass. It is hot countries.

41:34.292 --> 41:38.312
Hospitals have no personnel.
The families must come with food.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.688
South America is a hole. Africa is a
hole. California soon go bankrupt.

41:45.375 --> 41:46.979
Sun or welfare.

42:55.542 --> 42:58.479
I think I have got something in the eye.

42:59.167 --> 43:01.396
- In the eye or on the eye?
- In the eye.

43:02.667 --> 43:04.063
Yes.

43:06.083 --> 43:10.479
- So you better see a doctor.
- No, it's nothing serious.

43:11.167 --> 43:14.604
I see him.
It is night vision that fail.

43:18.417 --> 43:20.563
- Shall I drive?
- No.

43:22.042 --> 43:24.063
I can drive.

45:09.875 --> 45:12.521
Well, we won't get much more out of him.

45:14.333 --> 45:17.271
Do not say a damn thing.
We have been at it all night.

45:17.958 --> 45:20.271
Well …but then…

45:20.958 --> 45:23.479
Then there isn't so much
to talk about.

45:34.417 --> 45:37.479
Now they must learn
that they can not do as they please.

45:47.333 --> 45:51.021
BUMPER-TO-BUMPER DRIVING.
WAIT FOR SNOWPLOW.

46:56.167 --> 46:59.146
- Long time No see.
- Yes.

47:01.167 --> 47:03.354
What do you want?

47:04.042 --> 47:06.271
Someone killed Ingvar.

47:09.375 --> 47:10.521
Killed?

47:11.208 --> 47:13.729
Someone told somebody
to kill him.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.604
Why do you come here
to say that?

47:19.292 --> 47:22.271
You are his uncle.
I have never asked you for anything.

47:43.458 --> 47:45.646
You can sit on this.

47:47.583 --> 47:50.146
- Turn off now.
- Two minutes.

47:50.833 --> 47:54.354
- Give me the remote.
- What are you doing? Do not be silly.

47:55.042 --> 47:57.479
- Is it a sexy foreplay for you?
- Sexy…

47:58.167 --> 48:00.854
Why are you so annoying?
Stop it!

48:01.542 --> 48:03.229
Go out and make coffee!

48:07.125 --> 48:11.688
Rumor has it that Ingvar and Finn
has stolen a bag from the Count.

48:12.375 --> 48:14.063
Count? Do you know him?

48:14.750 --> 48:17.188
I once worked
for his father. Bullit.

48:17.875 --> 48:20.396
His son Count
took over the business.

48:21.083 --> 48:24.229
He was fucking great.
He and the Serbs share the market.

48:26.250 --> 48:29.104
- I will kill him.
- You will?

48:29.792 --> 48:32.771
You could never kill anyone.

48:38.958 --> 48:42.063
I have killed a Jappe,
a Ronaldo and a Strike.

48:42.750 --> 48:46.688
I rolled them into chicken wire
and threw them in the waterfalls.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.604
Then the little fish can get in
and gnaw the flesh from the bones…

48:53.292 --> 48:56.229
…so they do not swell.
Then they just are there.

48:56.917 --> 49:01.104
But the Count is not just
a fucking Ronaldo or Jappe.

49:01.792 --> 49:04.771
He's a dangerous bastard.
You can not neck him.

49:08.208 --> 49:09.396
Thank you.

49:24.250 --> 49:29.146
What is he doing here? I told you to
keep away from the criminal types.

49:29.833 --> 49:35.104
- This is my brother! My little brother.
- Brother, no…

49:43.375 --> 49:48.021
She's just a little worried that you
are one of the old boys.

49:48.708 --> 49:51.771
I have promised her
to to behave myself.

49:52.458 --> 49:54.938
I will at least try.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.313
- Forget it, Nils.
- A father must surely avenge his son!

50:01.000 --> 50:05.146
Have you become Dirty Harry, or what?
Drop that bullshit.

50:07.042 --> 50:08.646
Nils!

50:09.333 --> 50:12.188
Wait a minute.
Do not be so damn childish!

50:12.875 --> 50:16.271
You're damn right as annoying
as mother.

50:16.958 --> 50:20.938
If you say something bad about mother
I'll knock your teeth in.

50:21.625 --> 50:23.438
Okay.

50:24.125 --> 50:26.438
The Counts name is Ole Forsby.

50:27.125 --> 50:31.688
But if you must kill him
you must get an assassin.

50:34.417 --> 50:37.063
How do I find one?

50:37.750 --> 50:41.771
There is one who calls himself the Chinese.
I think he is still active.

50:42.458 --> 50:44.688
What's with these names?

50:45.375 --> 50:49.854
The Chinese, The Count,
Dirty Harry, Bullit, Jappe.

50:50.542 --> 50:52.771
It is an old gangster thing.

50:54.083 --> 50:55.938
What is your name?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.146
Wingman.

51:01.417 --> 51:05.604
- Wingman?
- Yeah, you know… like in Top Gun.

51:06.292 --> 51:10.479
<i>The movie…
"You Can be my wingman."</i>

51:13.042 --> 51:15.354
How do I find the Chinese?

51:16.458 --> 51:22.313
Have you got the money? Do not worry,
she can't understand a word. Have you?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.438
Yes, 90,000.

51:29.750 --> 51:33.604
Okay.
You book a hotel room for him.

51:34.292 --> 51:37.521
But only give him half
before he does the job.

51:38.208 --> 51:41.521
He has a fear of flying and taking the
train. You pick him up at the station.

51:42.208 --> 51:45.104
Not in your own car,
then he sees the license plate.

51:45.792 --> 51:49.646
Take a taxi, give him the address. Take
home and wait, and then check on the web.

51:50.333 --> 51:55.604
Once you know that he is dead, you send
the rest of the money to the hotel.

51:58.375 --> 52:00.729
Is there anything
you are unsure about?

52:04.292 --> 52:06.604
Why is he called the Chinese?

52:10.083 --> 52:13.188
It must be cold here
for a Chinese.

52:46.208 --> 52:49.229
No. Half now
and then half when I…

52:49.917 --> 52:53.396
I don't know your name.
I don't know your house.

52:54.083 --> 52:58.021
I don't know if you send the rest
when the job is done.

53:13.250 --> 53:17.563
<i>As a biologist, I am optimistic.
Much is pointing in the right direction.</i>

53:18.250 --> 53:22.104
<i>We have become more humane
towards each other and towards animals.</i>

53:22.792 --> 53:28.271
<i>The default behavior 100 years ago
we now perceive as barbaric.</i>

53:28.958 --> 53:34.354
<i>We kill each other
in increasingly smaller extent.</i>

53:37.000 --> 53:39.021
We have got our sushi.

53:40.750 --> 53:42.021
Here you go.

53:43.458 --> 53:45.854
Well, well. Getting lots of people.

53:46.542 --> 53:49.438
Exotic today, how cozy.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.188
Yes?

53:53.042 --> 53:58.313
Then we'll see
if I will buy. Rune?

53:59.000 --> 54:03.479
We need to hold a small meeting here.
Why don't you go and take a carrot?

54:04.167 --> 54:05.646
Okay.

54:24.042 --> 54:27.521
Cold.
It's called "to make me cold."

54:28.208 --> 54:30.771
- Cold? Okay.
- Is the the Albanian Papa?

54:31.458 --> 54:36.063
- We have a little trouble with him for the time.
- Papa is Serb.

54:36.750 --> 54:39.896
- No, it's not Papa.
- Who is it?

54:42.833 --> 54:47.688
Okay, you want to sell me the name of him
that want me cool. I get it.

54:49.958 --> 54:51.063
How much?

54:53.667 --> 54:56.729
Fine. You are a business man.
Understood.

54:57.417 --> 55:00.854
I know very well
that the Chinese is Asia's Jews.

55:03.167 --> 55:05.354
- So you buy?
- I'm buying.

55:11.250 --> 55:15.813
Deposit the money here. When I see it
has gone into accounts in the Cayman…

55:16.500 --> 55:20.063
…I'll tell you the name
on your enemy.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.729
It's called "account". Non accounts.

55:25.833 --> 55:27.313
Singular.

55:32.083 --> 55:33.646
Fine.

55:42.583 --> 55:45.479
- Dickman.
- Dickman, Dickman.

55:47.292 --> 55:50.604
My dad had a damn
Dickman on the payroll.

55:51.292 --> 55:55.813
What was his name?
Wing... Lord? Wing King? Wing... Geir?

55:56.500 --> 55:58.813
- Wingman.
- Yes, Wingman, dammit!

55:59.500 --> 56:04.563
- Good, old Wingman wants me dead.
- So I say thank you and go.

56:05.250 --> 56:08.771
Hey, I just
a little moral question for you.

56:09.458 --> 56:13.604
Now you are in Norway.
This is not a banana republic.

56:14.292 --> 56:17.854
Here in Norway
we keep our agreements.

56:18.542 --> 56:21.604
I kept my word.
You give money, I give enemy.

56:22.292 --> 56:25.896
That agreement you have held.
But now I think of the other one.

56:26.583 --> 56:28.396
You made a deal…

56:29.083 --> 56:32.354
- with a paying Norwegian citizen
about making me cold.

56:33.042 --> 56:35.354
And that agreement
you have not met.

56:37.875 --> 56:39.063
Ugh.

56:43.250 --> 56:45.563
Will you please leave the carpet?

56:51.792 --> 56:53.896
Really good maki roll.

57:03.458 --> 57:09.688
- Doesn't it smell like firecrackers?
- No, isn't it more like Chinese food?

57:10.375 --> 57:12.604
Fried, right?

57:13.292 --> 57:16.354
- Soya in roll.
- Kung Fu tomaki.

57:30.125 --> 57:32.104
Imagine if someone discovers us?

57:33.875 --> 57:37.313
No one discovers us if we
are cautious.

57:38.583 --> 57:41.604
Hey, it will be OK.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.896
I've lit them all.

58:15.708 --> 58:18.271
- How did it go?
- It went well.

58:18.958 --> 58:22.729
- I did basically as you said.
- Basically?

58:23.417 --> 58:28.146
I gave him all the money. He can't
rely on someone he doesn't know.

58:42.667 --> 58:46.854
- There are perfect snow conditions right now.
- Damn it!

58:56.875 --> 59:00.854
I just thought it would be good
for you to go skiing.

59:10.458 --> 59:12.979
Do you know what
Dickman means in Norwegian?

59:16.667 --> 59:18.188
"Pikmand".

59:21.875 --> 59:23.813
It hell does.

59:44.292 --> 59:48.188
FLOUR-KING PARTY WITH THE CELEBS:
THRIVES AS SINGLE!

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.563
Hello, Wingman.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.604
Do you have time for
a little conversation?

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:19.354
Actually it's just
a small request.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.896
Hello hello.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.646
It's been a while.
Do you remember me?

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:32.438
Ole, you know.
We have room for one more in here.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.188
Are you sitting comfortably?

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:02.396
You've grown old.
You must take good care of yourself.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:06.313
Shit.
I need help.

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:13.396
Someone is after me.
A hit man called Dickman.

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:20.479
I know only one
called Dickman, and that's you.

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:24.646
I was thinking of course,
that it may be a coincidence.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:27.771
It may be
another Dickman than you.

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:31.104
But I don't believe
in coincidences…

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:34.521
…so I thought
I just had to go to you…

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:38.271
…and then ask you.
Ask you, ask for help…

01:01:38.958 --> 01:01:42.729
…to try to find out,
if perhaps one in your family…

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:45.563
…isn't not so happy about me.

01:01:47.292 --> 01:01:50.938
Right?
An uncle or a father…

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.354
…or brother
or a naughty nephew or…

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.354
Dickman…

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:03.521
I have never been able
to forgive your father.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.104
What?

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.979
He took my woman from me.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.563
That dick
had a thousand women.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:18.104
- You know that?
- One of them was mine.

01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:24.396
And what does that have to do with me?

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.938
His blood runs in your veins.

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:31.813
His grin sitting is on your mouth.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.729
I've drove damn far
hoping to get a good story.

01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:43.146
I took all three of them:
Ronaldo, Jappe, Strike.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.938
It was just the start.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.854
Why are you telling me this?

01:02:55.542 --> 01:03:00.146
So Chinese didn't get you?
Too bad.

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.479
You can do whatever
the hell you want with me.

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:08.854
I have cancer in the ass.

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:11.146
I shit on you.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:17.688
- Where's my cocaine?
- I have flushed it down the toilet.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.688
- 15 kg.
- At least.

01:03:26.208 --> 01:03:29.438
I can give you
a horrible painful death.

01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:32.896
Pain is just weakness leaving the body.

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:36.021
Hell,
there I was quite touched.

01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:40.021
Now, you're fucking touching me.
Quite into the soul.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.604
That's fine.

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:49.938
It's fine.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:54.813
So it is.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:58.979
Wingman.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.354
Not here.

01:05:02.042 --> 01:05:03.813
It is now.

01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:28.438
They called us to tell
where we could find him.

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.688
And what is it they hanged him on?

01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:39.688
1389!

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:44.271
- This is a serious provocation.
- What are you talking about?

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:48.521
Norwegians don't know the
Kosovo battle in 1389.

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:52.104
The plate just states the
height above sea level.

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:55.938
It was his first trip.

01:06:00.583 --> 01:06:02.771
"Give me the chance."

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:06.979
"I am a grown man."

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:11.146
"I am your son."

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:15.354
"You will be proud of me."

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.521
And now he hangs here
in a foreign country.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.604
Like a mongrel.

01:06:31.917 --> 01:06:35.354
We must bury him
in the homeland.

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:37.521
We must.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:46.854
- We will avenge us.
- We must, Papa. We must.

01:08:25.224 --> 01:08:26.296
Hey.

01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:29.813
What the hell?

01:08:32.531 --> 01:08:33.531
Did you forget?

01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.022
What?

01:08:35.218 --> 01:08:36.218
You forgot!

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.354
A fucking parents meeting.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:48.812
I was at a parents meeting
last month, Marit.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.937
I was at school / home conversation
and went to the fucking bully seminar.

01:08:54.625 --> 01:09:00.145
Now you gotta relax. I have a job,
which is pissing difficult and demanding.

01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:04.747
No need to get excited.

01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:08.426
You're not an important business man.
You're a criminal.

01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:13.437
You know what?

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:21.104
You know me well.
But I also know you.

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:24.479
You're not fooling me
with your Neo-hippie mittens.

01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:28.895
I remember when you could go
in all stores worldwide…

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.104
…and buy what you wanted.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:34.604
Then there was nothing wrong
with the money or anything else.

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:40.354
Take your parents' meeting and stuff it
so far up your dry, Danish ass…

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:43.270
…you never find it again.

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:48.562
For I shit on the fucking
parents' meeting and I shit on you.

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:05.646
It's not fucking easy
to be me, Geir.

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:29.875
What?

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:32.729
If Dickman has bumped off our people…

01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:36.729
…the Serbs are probably pissed
that we hung that guy up.

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:38.688
Do you want a cup of tea, Papa?
You're probably tired.

01:12:45.292 --> 01:12:49.063
Condolences. I will protect him
with my own life.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:15.188
We had a good deal.

01:13:16.917 --> 01:13:19.771
We shared the towns between us.

01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:24.313
We agreed that the shitty airfield
should be common.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.146
We have kept our part of the bargain.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:32.313
And how do they held their part?
Yes, they killed my only son.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:40.437
My only son is now on the way to
mother Serbia, where he will be buried.

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:47.813
We are here,
and it is time for revenge.

01:13:50.375 --> 01:13:52.896
Blood for blood.

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:55.396
Son for son.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:40.479
See right there.
She gathers a fucking shit up.

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:45.188
What will she do with it?

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:49.396
It is a Norwegian practice.
They do such things.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:53.312
Goddamn it.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.563
Does it still hurt in the tooth?
Go to a dentist.

01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.938
When would I have time for that?

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.229
- Have you been in a Norwegian prison?
- No, not yet.

01:15:09.917 --> 01:15:12.396
You have something
to look forward to.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:15.396
Good food. Heating.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.312
Good food?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.479
You won't believe it.

01:15:21.167 --> 01:15:26.021
- You get wages for jobs there.
- You're kidding me.

01:15:26.708 --> 01:15:29.563
I swear!
And everyone is friendly and courteous.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:35.438
Guards don't harass you.
No rapes. Even the inmates are nice.

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:40.104
No rapes, nice guards...
You don't fool me.

01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:44.521
A modern society. Civilized.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.979
See, I had all my teeth done.

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.229
In prison?

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.979
This week she fetch the boy.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:04.521
A week with the father
the next week with his mother.

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:07.688
Imagine if you had to share a son.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:12.688
What kind of people are they?

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:28.854
- That with the Albanian was not smart.
- Serb.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.854
- He was a Serb.
- Not anymore.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:42.271
We have a big problem.
Now we need to find a solution.

01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:49.354
Does anyone have
any good suggestions?

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:57.312
Well, I do not…

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.188
It was perhaps not a good idea
to pin the bill up on him.

01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:06.521
They surely want an apology.

01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:12.937
Yes, it's almost as if I were
to buy a bouquet and send them a card.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:20.187
They want something big in return.
Something that is ours.

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:26.188
Hey? Is there more coffee, or what?

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:32.104
Thank you.

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.313
What?

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:50.646
Yes. Now they get
something in return.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:55.229
Then they'll understand that we are
really sad. Thank you.

01:17:57.708 --> 01:17:59.729
Cut the head, wrap it.

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:03.021
Send it to them and say,
it is the culprit.

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:07.729
Say we only want peace.
Say we extend our condolences.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:11.354
Then we might
get some peace and quiet here.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:37.104
- Is everything clear?
- We have it all.

01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:40.604
- Tape, rope, bag…
- Everything, everything, everything!

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:54.937
It's me. We are here.
Should we get the kid?

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.396
Why?

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:04.438
Fine. It's a deal.

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:08.813
They say we should wait.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.021
- What are we waiting for?
- They have sent a messenger.

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.521
What the hell…

01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:18.646
Papa says we have to wait.

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:18.104
There we have the Pink Panther. Come on.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.729
Thank you for seeing me.

01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:03.604
He has been punished
for his misdeed.

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.896
We only want peace with you, okay?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.854
Okay. Thank you.

01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:20.271
Are you kind
to draw the curtains?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.479
It pains me to have to say this.

01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:36.521
Thanks for the gift.

01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:50.729
But I require a son
for my son.

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:07.229
- Are you as crazy?
- Do it again and I'll shoot you.

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:17.104
- Now?
- Yes.

01:22:17.792 --> 01:22:20.396
You don't want to
get a tooth decay.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.313
- But it's mother's week.
- Yes, and she asked me to pick you up.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.438
I'm doing her a favor. Come on.

01:22:38.708 --> 01:22:40.729
Hello. It's me.

01:22:41.417 --> 01:22:43.854
Just wait until we're done.

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:47.771
Move!

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:11.438
You isn't working for my father.

01:23:14.125 --> 01:23:18.313
- Who were those men?
- I have no idea.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.354
- Disappeared in a van?
- There was something on the side.

01:23:23.042 --> 01:23:27.438
- What? What the hell was that?
- A name and phone number.

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:31.021
It was there
where the airfield is located.

01:23:31.708 --> 01:23:36.187
Papa, it's no problem to find
neither the kid or van.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:39.896
And not the guy either.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:44.354
Get him out
before he starts to stink.

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:10.479
Hello?

01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:14.021
He can not
come to the phone right now.

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:18.104
Because he is dead.
As you soon are.

01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:22.563
He hung up the damn rat.

01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:30.396
The bloody Count will
shit his pants…

01:24:31.083 --> 01:24:33.938
…when he gets to know
that we got his son.

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:36.646
I wont take it.

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:41.188
They can't just take my son
and not phone. You don't do that..

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:47.146
Nobody shoots the messenger. What is it
with the Albanian monkeys?

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.396
Fucking Mohammedan pig cunts.

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:55.563
We know what they're doing.
Fucking dogs and pigs night and day.

01:24:56.250 --> 01:25:00.604
The soggy pile of inbred
domestic workers and construction workers.

01:25:01.292 --> 01:25:03.938
Fucking eastern monkeys.

01:25:16.542 --> 01:25:19.229
Now they fucking taken my boy.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.313
My little boy.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.604
They have dammit taken my boy.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:38.146
I want them to know
I wont put up with this.

01:26:06.917 --> 01:26:08.646
Hell of a sack!

01:26:42.333 --> 01:26:44.729
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

01:26:46.542 --> 01:26:48.771
- All alone?
- Yes.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:56.563
- You don't have any children?
- No.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.646
It's not so smart of you
to take me home.

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:33.438
I just want to
talk a little with your dad.

01:27:34.125 --> 01:27:35.229
Now?

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.729
Tomorrow.

01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:48.604
- Welcome!
- Good evening.

01:27:49.292 --> 01:27:52.979
- Six single rooms, thanks.
- Have you booked?

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:13.938
- She got to be kidding!

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:27.188
We have a problem.
There are only two large rooms.

01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:29.563
One is for me.

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:34.979
I'll pay cash as usual.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.063
Where do you sleep?

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:52.188
- I sleep in the next room.
- And what if I run away?

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:58.396
You don't. Then you’ll freeze to death.
And you wouldn't be able to find your way.

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:03.063
I usually get a bedtime story,
before I fall asleep.

01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:10.021
I have no stories.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:16.729
You can just read from something.
It does not matter what it is.

01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:21.521
"It has as special features
two independent MTU engines…

01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:25.854
…with a total force of
more than 2,000 horsepower."

01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:30.479
- I have one of these.
- You do?

01:29:31.167 --> 01:29:33.813
Why? Aren't you a kidnapper?

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:38.646
Not always.

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:46.104
This has a capacity
four thousand tonnes of snow per hour.

01:29:46.792 --> 01:29:51.521
It throws 30-35 meters.
Weighing 5.8 tons.

01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:57.063
- It is fine.
- Can I get a ride in it?

01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:04.563
You must sleep now.

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:21.437
Have you heard about
Stockholm Syndrome?

01:30:25.042 --> 01:30:29.479
First, we find the alien on the plate
then the Swede at the dam.

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:32.729
It smells fucking of…

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:36.729
It smells of gangster war.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:39.078
Please call the police.

01:30:39.625 --> 01:30:42.813
If we call the police,
then they kill Rune.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.354
Marit, you must listen to me.

01:30:48.667 --> 01:30:53.021
Is it you or me
who best understand the situation here?

01:30:53.708 --> 01:30:57.063
They will call us.
And then they will make their demands.

01:30:57.750 --> 01:31:02.438
Then I give them what they demand
and then we Rune back.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.688
That is how it works.

01:31:09.447 --> 01:31:11.411
In 24 hours I'll call the police.

01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:13.604
In 24 hours he is here again.

01:31:14.933 --> 01:31:16.370
I hope you burn in hell.

01:31:16.917 --> 01:31:18.896
Then I'll see you there, Marit.

01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:02.771
We haven't managed
to find him yet.

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:09.521
It's a small town. Sooner or later
we find the car. Without a doubt.

01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:12.396
Right?

01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:16.313
We keep looking.

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:26.146
- It's the janitor from Runes school.
- Oh, how nice. Hello.

01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:34.813
Just say what you said to me.
Then you get the money.

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:41.146
I said something about the car and those
who ran off with the kid.

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:48.604
There was a name
and address on the car.

01:32:49.292 --> 01:32:52.979
Now, my memory's not
as good as it has been, but…

01:32:58.667 --> 01:33:01.021
There's somethings that stick.

01:33:05.375 --> 01:33:08.771
There was also a phone number
but I do not remember it.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.813
I thought it was
a strange name. Dickman.

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:21.771
He hasn't spoken to the police.

01:33:24.542 --> 01:33:27.479
- Yes, what are we talking about?
- 30,000.

01:33:34.417 --> 01:33:36.563
There is the 30.

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.938
And there is 29.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:06.271
Dickman has a goddam relative.

01:34:26.958 --> 01:34:28.729
Yes?

01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:34.854
<i>I have your son. To see him alive
you come alone.</i>

01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:37.688
I know how it is done.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.271
You might also want money?
It's usually to ask for.

01:34:44.958 --> 01:34:47.354
<i>We'll talk about it when you get here.</i>

01:34:48.042 --> 01:34:52.271
I get in the car now
and I'll see you tonight.

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:45.604
Hi there! You have a fine visitor
waiting for you at home.

01:35:46.292 --> 01:35:51.146
- Nice visitor?
- They stopped and asked me for directions.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:56.813
They had a suit and tie. The
resembled people from the Progress Party.

01:35:58.333 --> 01:36:01.854
We had hoped for you
in the Center Party.

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:06.313
But of course it's
entirely up to you.

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:11.521
But it's good to see
that you are back on your feet.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:14.521
It must have been a hard blow
with Ingvar.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:20.396
Do you remember Finn, Heimdahls son?
He too started with the drugs.

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:23.271
They found him yesterday.

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:49.688
- Is that yours?
- No. It is an old machine.

01:36:50.375 --> 01:36:52.813
None of those are mine.
Come here.

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:57.354
Stay here
until someone comes to get you.

01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:05.354
Look here.

01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:23.854
Look here.

01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:28.479
So, we know
his wife looks like a cow.

01:37:29.167 --> 01:37:34.104
I was more thinking about the snow plow.
And on his company.

01:37:39.875 --> 01:37:43.479
- Where the hell is Geir?
- I think he's in the first car.

01:37:47.958 --> 01:37:50.688
- Radovan, will you try?
- Yes, why not?

01:38:14.375 --> 01:38:15.896
Hello?

01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:18.229
I'm listening.

01:38:27.708 --> 01:38:29.188
Number 14

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:49.729
- Radovan! Do you think you are an eagle?
- A Serbian eagle!

01:38:50.417 --> 01:38:55.604
Papa, we have the man. We got the address.
We have it all. Do you hear, Papa?

01:39:36.875 --> 01:39:39.563
- Why do you have a gun?
- No question.

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:43.104
Now do as I say!
Stay here.

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:50.688
Why are you so angry?

01:39:51.375 --> 01:39:54.896
You must do as I say.
Do you understand? Stay here.

01:39:55.583 --> 01:39:57.313
Get in.

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:52.604
Where is my son?

01:41:56.208 --> 01:41:58.229
Where is my son?

01:42:06.292 --> 01:42:07.896
You know what?

01:42:08.583 --> 01:42:12.188
If I have to ask something
three times, I get a little pissed off.

01:42:12.875 --> 01:42:17.979
And then I begin to think of other
ways to get you to talk.

01:42:18.667 --> 01:42:22.521
You might think that my profession is not
a creative profession, but that it is.

01:42:24.542 --> 01:42:30.021
And with such a man as you, we'll
go quite traditional about it.

01:42:30.708 --> 01:42:34.021
I will pull your finger nails,
cut your fingers off.

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:39.396
I cut your hands off, take
your ears and cut your nose off.

01:42:40.083 --> 01:42:42.813
And exactly that with the nose…

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.896
…you're not going to like.

01:42:49.792 --> 01:42:53.479
- I go in and look for Rune.
- Fine.

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:56.229
I'll talk to you.

01:47:54.375 --> 01:47:56.438
Will you to give a message…

01:47:58.167 --> 01:48:00.104
…to Marit?

01:48:00.792 --> 01:48:02.604
Tell her…

01:48:07.625 --> 01:48:09.771
…that she is a cunt.
