WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:05.500
This is a battlefield.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.789
On one side

00:07.790 --> 00:09.310
is the United States
Attorney's Office.

00:12.580 --> 00:16.959
On the other side
is the Federal Public Defender.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.749
You are among the best
and the brightest attorneys

00:19.750 --> 00:21.379
in this country.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.959
You are passionate.
You are dedicated.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.119
You are talented. You are
incredibly hard-working.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.539
You handle the most difficult
and the most challenging cases

00:29.540 --> 00:32.879
in the most prestigious,
highest profile trial court

00:32.880 --> 00:34.669
in the country.

00:34.670 --> 00:38.329
You're extraordinary advocates
and worthy adversaries.

00:38.330 --> 00:43.709
You are The Defenders.
You are Justice.

00:43.710 --> 00:49.749
And you come together
to fight on this battlefield.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.119
And, honestly,
I'm really dreading it.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.169
Really! I've been umping

00:56.170 --> 00:58.329
in the New York Lawyers
Softball League for 11 years,

00:58.330 --> 01:00.959
and this is the one game
of the season

01:00.960 --> 01:02.959
that I do not look forward to.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.709
Because... you... stink.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.169
Thank you, Judge.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.119
Really appreciate that,
Your Honor.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.749
Okay. Great.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.790
Now let's play ball!

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.880 --> 01:51.880
Let's play ball!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.669
What inning is it? I lost count.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.249
First inning. Really?

01:58.250 --> 01:59.579
You guys are terrible.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.079
Yes, that is true,
but, I mean, we're having fun.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.499
And... And who ever thought
that was possible, you know?

02:05.500 --> 02:08.959
Prosecutors, defenders.
Dogs, cats. Sharks and Jets.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.379
Gryffindors and Slytherins...
Yeah, I got it.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.329
Because you were just staring...
I got it.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.669
My point is,
we've all come a long way.

02:15.670 --> 02:16.830
Still the first inning.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.749
Let's bring it in!

02:32.750 --> 02:35.119
The senior United States
Senator from New York,

02:35.120 --> 02:38.329
Walter Carson,
has been shot multiple times

02:38.330 --> 02:40.669
outside of a house
in Scarsdale, New York.

02:40.670 --> 02:43.169
The area around the home
remains an active crime scene,

02:43.170 --> 02:44.749
and few details have emerged

02:44.750 --> 02:47.169
about what is already
the highest-profile shooting

02:47.170 --> 02:49.749
of an American politician
in a generation.

02:49.750 --> 02:50.959
Was this political? Do we know?

02:50.960 --> 02:52.669
We don't know.
Have others been shot?

02:52.670 --> 02:53.829
We don't know.
Whose house is this?

02:53.830 --> 02:55.169
The Senator's, I assume.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.419
Don't assume, 'cause it isn't.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.250
Senator Carson lives
on the Upper East Side.

02:57.251 --> 02:58.879
We don't know
whose house this is,

02:58.880 --> 03:00.709
we don't know why he was there,
we don't know why he was shot.

03:00.710 --> 03:03.579
This could be a home invasion,
some random crime,

03:03.580 --> 03:05.329
it could be a political hit,
it could be a domestic dispute.

03:05.330 --> 03:06.330
We don't know.

03:06.331 --> 03:08.000
And until we know,
we don't know...

03:08.790 --> 03:10.209
What do you know?

03:10.210 --> 03:12.169
Nothing. And if I did,
I couldn't talk about it.

03:12.170 --> 03:13.959
I'm just asking...
Are we picking this up?

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
I don't know.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.580
You okay?

03:17.880 --> 03:20.459
Carson handed me my diploma
at Stuyvesant High in '89.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.459
I was a volunteer
on his '92 campaign.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.249
Worked out of
the Rochester field office.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.580
Jill.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.919
I got to go.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.329
Okay, we're getting word

03:33.330 --> 03:35.539
from University Memorial
Hospital...

03:35.540 --> 03:39.709
63-year-old United States
Senator Walter Carson has died

03:39.710 --> 03:42.079
as a result
of multiple gunshot wounds.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.499
Senator Carson becomes

03:43.500 --> 03:46.539
the first United States Senator
killed in office

03:46.540 --> 03:49.329
since the man who previously
held this same seat

03:49.330 --> 03:52.379
was gunned down
in California in 1968...

03:52.380 --> 03:55.119
New York Senator
Robert F. Kennedy.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.329
The senator's son
lives in Scarsdale.

03:57.330 --> 03:59.999
Just moved in.
This was his house.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.249
What are you guys wearing?

04:01.250 --> 04:03.289
Who are you? Ted. Who are you?

04:03.290 --> 04:05.079
You're not Ted. Who is this?

04:05.080 --> 04:07.619
Ted. Ted is our
new investigator.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.209
Well, our old investigator
was named Ted.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.039
I know. It's confusing.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.669
It's actually
not that confusing.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.209
You just need to remember
your investigator is named Ted.

04:15.210 --> 04:18.209
This was
the Senator's son's house.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.418
Maybe he was shot
at his son's house

04:19.420 --> 04:20.789
because there was
less security there?

04:20.790 --> 04:23.289
Senators don't have full-time
security outside of Washington.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.669
Sir, FBI is confirming
Senator Carson was shot

04:25.670 --> 04:27.459
by local police. The police?

04:27.460 --> 04:29.879
That doesn't make any sense.
Senator Carson is white.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.709
A 911 call was made
to Scarsdale police

04:31.710 --> 04:33.499
reporting an active shooter
at this residence.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.669
The police responded
with more than 50 officers

04:35.670 --> 04:36.879
from seven different
departments,

04:36.880 --> 04:38.039
including
the Special Response Team.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.459
Senator Carson apparently

04:39.460 --> 04:41.039
ran out the doorway
after his grandson

04:41.040 --> 04:42.579
and was shot on the front porch.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.880
The boy was uninjured.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.789
E-Excuse me. I need a lawyer.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.209
Give us a minute.

04:49.210 --> 04:50.930
Someone just killed
a United States Senator.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.960
Yeah. Th-That was me.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.210
- I rep WorldWarBlood.
- What?

05:15.211 --> 05:16.579
It's a video game,
WorldWarBlood.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.829
Online multiplayer.

05:17.830 --> 05:20.419
This dude in my Pillage Guild...
MySoCalledKnife...

05:20.420 --> 05:22.379
Bet me he could beat me
to a hundred caps, so...

05:22.380 --> 05:25.249
Okay, okay, stop. Back up.
What is your name?

05:25.250 --> 05:27.499
Julian. Okay, Julian.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.669
What does "WorldWarBlood"
and "Pillage Guild" and "Caps"

05:29.670 --> 05:31.209
have to do with the Senator?

05:31.210 --> 05:33.579
I had a disagreement
with MySoCalledKnife,

05:33.580 --> 05:36.419
and, you know, it...
It got a little out of control.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.959
And he was like,
"Why don't you swat me, then?"

05:37.960 --> 05:39.119
And I was like, "Fine, I will,"
so I just...

05:39.120 --> 05:40.120
Wait, why...
Why don't you what me?

05:40.121 --> 05:42.080
My God. This was a swatting.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.539
S-Swatting. Nobody?

05:44.540 --> 05:46.379
Really? Really? Ted.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.079
Why does his name
have to be Ted?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.499
Swatting is when
someone calls 911 and reports

05:50.500 --> 05:53.169
that something horrible
is happening at some address...

05:53.170 --> 05:55.119
An active shooter,
a bomb, hostages...

05:55.120 --> 05:57.379
And the police send
a Special Response Team...

05:57.380 --> 05:59.329
A SWAT team... and everyone
there is terrorized.

05:59.330 --> 06:01.419
It's big in the gamer community.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.879
He gave me his address,
so I did it.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.249
Except the address
he gave you...

06:04.250 --> 06:05.669
Wasn't his.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.959
It was the son
of a United States Senator.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.379
I didn't know that.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.249
How hard is it to trace
these 911 calls?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.999
I used a tor browser and spoofed
the call in a VOIP network

06:13.000 --> 06:14.379
to mask the number.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.500
Difficult. Not impossible.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.379
You don't have to
turn yourself in, Julian.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.709
I'm not advising you not to.
I'm not advising you to.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.829
I-I-I don't want a bunch of cops
coming to my house.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.829
My mom, she doesn't
need to see that.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.579
I messed this up.

06:29.580 --> 06:30.789
If you're not gonna help me,

06:30.790 --> 06:32.419
I'll walk over
to the FBI myself...

06:32.420 --> 06:34.170
Julian,
we are going to help you.

06:37.290 --> 06:39.039
Ted, I want you to look
into everything you can

06:39.040 --> 06:40.579
about Julian's past.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.959
His online activity.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.579
These other guys
playing the game.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.829
Sandra, you bought this one.
It's yours.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.999
The government is going to file
a false report charge,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.169
but see what else
they might hit him with.

06:49.170 --> 06:50.539
Contact his parents.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.789
Jay. Duty.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.959
Allison, these cases.
All of them.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.620
This is all hands on deck.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.249
I don't know anything.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.249
I do.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.999
Walter Carson was
a tireless public servant,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.619
a proud New Yorker,

07:13.620 --> 07:16.499
a wonderful father and...
And husband.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.579
Swatting is not a joke.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.079
It's an act of terrible
cowardice and cruelty.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.249
And I can assure you
that this office

07:24.250 --> 07:26.829
will bring every possible
resource to bear

07:26.830 --> 07:28.209
in prosecuting Julian Sarco

07:28.210 --> 07:30.460
to the fullest extent
of the law.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.249
We've got nothing, do we?

07:34.250 --> 07:35.459
We have Julian Sarco.

07:35.460 --> 07:38.249
For filing a false report
to emergency services.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.039
18 years old. No priors.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.289
Maybe gets four years.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.079
For killing
a United States Senator.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.579
He didn't kill
a United States Senator.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.499
What about the officer who did
kill a United States senator?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.209
He acted within protocol.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.539
What else can we charge
Sarco with?

07:50.540 --> 07:52.749
Sarco was in a Pillage Guild
with MySoCalledKnife.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.499
That's his handle...
MySoCalledKnife.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.119
MySoCalledKnife has lots
of enemies within WorldWarBlood,

07:57.120 --> 07:59.499
including KimJunMakeEmSayUn...

07:59.500 --> 08:01.419
D-Don't say the names anymore.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.499
Right. So, when it looked like

08:03.500 --> 08:05.079
Julian might not
go through with the swat,

08:05.080 --> 08:07.829
Kim offered Julian
some online currency to do it.

08:07.830 --> 08:10.170
Yeah. So... conspiracy?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.709
We need more.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.039
More?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.209
That is everything Julian
has said in WorldWarBlood

08:16.210 --> 08:18.039
over the last two years.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.209
It's dark and threatening
and grotesquely violent.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.419
Enjoy. This is horrible.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.419
He sounds like every kid
on a video game.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.579
Which is horrible.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.419
If you don't like video games.
Or kids.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.579
I don't. You know this is
bad for us, right?

08:28.580 --> 08:30.579
It is what it is.
It's bad for us.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.580
Look, if you say so.

08:31.581 --> 08:33.789
I do. I did. We need your help.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.419
Now, see,
if I was in your position,

08:36.419 --> 08:38.619
I would think that that would be
helpful information to have,

08:38.620 --> 08:40.208
and I would say,
"Wow, Ted, this is great.

08:40.210 --> 08:41.828
How did you turn this up
so quickly?"

08:41.830 --> 08:44.619
And you would say, "Aw, shucks,
just doing my job."

08:44.620 --> 08:46.579
You're me in this scenario.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.499
And then I would say, "I can't
imagine you found anything else out"

08:48.500 --> 08:50.329
in such a short period of time."

08:50.330 --> 08:52.499
And you would say,
"Actually, I did."-

08:52.500 --> 08:54.499
"I also found out
Julian Sarco has swatted

08:54.500 --> 08:55.919
six other times in the past."

08:55.920 --> 08:56.920
And I would say, "My God."

08:56.921 --> 08:58.329
That's so bad,
but so good to know.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.709
"Thank you." And I'd start
to walk away, so grateful.

09:00.710 --> 09:04.039
But then you would say,
"Wait. One more thing."

09:04.040 --> 09:05.459
The others involved in this,

09:05.460 --> 09:07.249
MySoCalledKnife
and KimJunMakeEmSayUn,

09:07.250 --> 09:09.619
they have both been identified
and are being investigated,

09:09.620 --> 09:11.669
but the focus is on Julian

09:11.670 --> 09:13.459
"because he's the one who
actually made the phone call."

09:13.460 --> 09:14.829
And I would say,
"You found all that out?"

09:14.830 --> 09:15.999
I'm speechless.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.669
"Who are you?"

09:17.670 --> 09:21.249
And then you would lean in
and say, "I am Ted."

09:21.250 --> 09:23.000
And then you'd walk away.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.829
Tina Krissman,
ladies and gentlemen!

09:29.830 --> 09:31.079
Don't do that.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.289
I will not do that again.

09:32.290 --> 09:34.379
Not on the Senator Carson case?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.419
They only give me
the important stuff, Tina.

09:36.420 --> 09:39.499
I'm a lawyer on duty.
I work with a blindfold.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.039
I put my hands out.
I take it. I shape it.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.000
I turn dirt into gold.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.379
My parents cut off
my allowance when I turned 30,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.499
like that's even a thing.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.619
What was I supposed to do?
Get a job?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.249
I have a job.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.419
I film myself sitting
in public spaces while I blog.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.999
How is that a job?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.789
How is that not a job?
Because you...

09:59.790 --> 10:01.789
You know what? Doesn't matter.
The allegation is

10:01.790 --> 10:03.419
you went into open houses
in your building

10:03.420 --> 10:05.419
and stole prescription drugs
from your neighbors

10:05.420 --> 10:06.420
and sold them.

10:06.421 --> 10:09.329
Okay. Are you done reaming me?

10:09.330 --> 10:11.749
Let me set the scene here
for you.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.669
I'm at an open house next door,
and I have to use the bathroom,

10:15.670 --> 10:19.619
and Ms. Wilding has this
tub of Vicodin on the counter.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.829
Like a wheelbarrow of Vicodin.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.619
And I'm like,
"Am I supposed to take this?

10:24.620 --> 10:25.999
Why is it just sitting there?"

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Right? Are you with me? No.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.289
So I take 2 or 3... 75.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.499
And I'm not using them,

10:30.500 --> 10:33.329
even though I'm super depressed.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.079
But my friend Burks
has a broken back.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.379
Or something.

10:36.380 --> 10:38.419
And he was like,
"If you give me the Vicodin,

10:38.420 --> 10:40.579
"I can give you a hundred
dollars" because he knows that

10:40.580 --> 10:43.169
my parents screwed me
on my allowance.

10:43.170 --> 10:45.169
So not a "sale."

10:45.170 --> 10:48.249
That is a sale.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.209
When is the lawyer
going to get here?

10:51.210 --> 10:53.329
I'm the lawyer.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.579
You're a lawyer?

10:54.580 --> 10:57.119
I'm your lawyer.
I'm a federal public defender.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.289
Whether or not I go to jail

10:59.290 --> 11:02.330
is in the hands
of a public defender?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.669
How can my parents not
hire me a real attorney?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.669
Okay, cool, great pep talk.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.039
Now, I'm gonna go do my job,
which is an actual job,

11:14.040 --> 11:15.709
and talk to the prosecutor.

11:15.710 --> 11:16.789
Wait!

11:16.790 --> 11:18.190
Is someone gonna
bring me breakfast?

11:19.250 --> 11:21.079
She still lives
with her parents?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.459
Well, sometimes it can
make financial sense

11:22.460 --> 11:23.539
to move back home.

11:23.540 --> 11:24.999
She's never left home.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.329
Sometimes that makes sense, too.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.079
You live with your parents.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.619
Nearby. Same borough.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.419
Same general area.
Yes, I live with my parents.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.999
How did we end up here,
talking about this?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.499
You got shut out of
the swatting case, too?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.459
I wouldn't say "shut out."

11:37.460 --> 11:38.879
I'd say strategically deployed

11:38.880 --> 11:41.079
on something dramatically
less important.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.919
Look, this girl is awful.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.249
I'm not gonna lie,
but this is...

11:44.250 --> 11:46.000
Ridiculous. We can do probation.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.709
I remember your office

11:48.710 --> 11:50.289
being smaller
and more depressing.

11:50.290 --> 11:51.499
Maybe that was just the mood?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.579
Nope. New office.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.789
This was Leonard Knox's
old office.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.999
Unfortunately, it didn't come
with his case load.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.249
Well, you're here,
and he's... wherever he is.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.499
Where is he, again?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.999
I'm in hell. It's not that hot.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.619
It's like 185 degrees.

12:06.620 --> 12:07.959
Try breathing
through your mouth.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.169
- I'm not doing that.
- You coming out with us tonight?

12:10.170 --> 12:11.579
Can't. Prepping my first case

12:11.580 --> 12:13.419
in front
of the Texas Supreme Court.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.579
Defending a challenge
to a statute

12:14.580 --> 12:16.579
that restricts pickling
to cucumbers.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.499
It's actually
pretty interesting...

12:18.500 --> 12:19.669
We're headed to
the South Congress Bridge

12:19.670 --> 12:21.079
to watch the bats at dusk.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.879
I hate bats. We hate bats.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.079
But we love
the out-of-town chicks

12:24.080 --> 12:25.459
who get wasted
and watch the bats.

12:25.460 --> 12:28.000
Sounds cool. Let me...
Let me think about it.

12:47.790 --> 12:50.209
You were right! Okay?

12:50.210 --> 12:51.419
We haven't talked in months,

12:51.420 --> 12:52.210
and that's what
you have to say to me?

12:52.211 --> 12:54.459
Is there anything
you'd rather hear?

12:54.460 --> 12:56.419
No, I guess not.
Right about what?

12:56.420 --> 12:58.419
Everything.
The heat, the white people,

12:58.420 --> 13:00.169
the bats, stupid festivals
every two days.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.579
You know what I did last night?

13:01.580 --> 13:04.419
I went to a mustache competition
because Austin is weird.

13:04.420 --> 13:05.959
My God.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.169
What?

13:07.170 --> 13:10.289
This line. For barbecue.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.209
I told you.
This is what I'm saying.

13:12.210 --> 13:15.459
Maybe I should come back.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.039
Should I come back?
Would Roger take me back?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.119
You'd have to ask Roger.
I need to go.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.499
I miss you. Leonard...

13:20.500 --> 13:21.709
I miss New York, the office,

13:21.710 --> 13:22.959
Hand-Pulled Noodle House #3.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.959
Yesterday,
I thought I missed Seth.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.169
Then that passed.
I miss the work there.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.749
You're the Solicitor General
of Texas.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.459
I am working
on a case about pickles.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.079
You're on the swatting case,
aren't you?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.879
You are not a quitter, Leonard.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.249
You're many things...
Spoiled, insolent,

13:39.250 --> 13:41.669
wrong on so many levels...

13:41.670 --> 13:44.039
But you're not a quitter.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.249
You thought about this decision
long and hard,

13:46.250 --> 13:48.829
and you made a choice.
You chose Texas.

13:48.830 --> 13:52.829
Now you just do it well.
Like I know you can.

13:52.830 --> 13:56.120
You chose Texas.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.789
You're right. Again.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.460
Goodbye, Leonard.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.249
New Ted! Good morning!

14:17.250 --> 14:18.499
"Ted" is fine.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.379
Nah, that's not gonna work.
Going with New Ted.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.789
Your parents are here.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.040
What? Why?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.709
Those aren't my parents.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.919
Mr. Simmons, I'm Bob Colgate.
This is my wife, Cindy.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.789
Holiday's parents.
So nice to meet you.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.579
I know how stressful
this kind of thing can be,

14:37.580 --> 14:40.959
but the good news is
she's not going to jail

14:40.960 --> 14:43.919
and this is not a felony.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.169
Where's the good news?

14:46.170 --> 14:49.169
So, there are two parts, really.

14:49.170 --> 14:51.919
Not going to jail
and not a felony.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.919
Which means she's back at home?
Correct.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.789
Right.
So how is that good for us?

14:56.790 --> 14:58.919
Y-You don't want her at home?

14:58.920 --> 15:00.419
You met her. Would you?

15:00.420 --> 15:01.959
She's not my daughter.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.419
That makes it worse. Trust me.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.829
Have you asked her to leave?

15:04.830 --> 15:06.709
137 times. This year.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.619
We served her
with eviction papers.

15:08.620 --> 15:11.209
You served your own daughter
with eviction papers?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.579
Wasn't that hard.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.039
I just gave them to her
coming out of the bathroom.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.579
This was our last hope.

15:15.580 --> 15:16.709
Wait, hold on.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.039
Y-You turned her in
about the Vicodin?

15:19.040 --> 15:20.379
- Of course.
- Yes!

15:20.380 --> 15:21.709
We didn't want
her to go to jail.

15:21.710 --> 15:22.999
M-Maybe a-a few nights.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.459
But if she's a convicted felon,

15:24.460 --> 15:25.420
the co-op won't let her live
in the building.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.249
This is insane.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.619
Says the successful professional

15:28.620 --> 15:30.379
who isn't living
with his parents.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.209
I mean, that's not relevant.

15:32.210 --> 15:35.419
Yeah, look, we know that we're
not innocent in all of this.

15:35.420 --> 15:38.829
We created a monster.
No rules, no discipline.

15:38.830 --> 15:41.079
And we named her Holiday,
for God's sake.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.539
We didn't break her spirit
when we should have,

15:42.540 --> 15:43.669
and that is on us.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.789
But this is on you!
You have to fix this!

15:46.790 --> 15:48.999
Well, unfortunately,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.619
Holiday's already
taken the deal.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.999
Your daughter's
not a convicted felon.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.040
I'm so sorry.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.119
We have all of Julian's
online communications.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.539
- Good.
- Not good.

16:02.540 --> 16:04.539
They're vengeful
and full of rage and threats,

16:04.540 --> 16:06.459
and he's swatted
six times in the past.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.249
What about the officer
who shot the Senator?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.250
He's clean.

16:09.251 --> 16:10.579
And the other gamers?

16:10.580 --> 16:11.580
They'll probably get charged,

16:11.581 --> 16:13.789
but that's not
gonna help Julian.

16:13.790 --> 16:16.919
We got nothing, really.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.379
What do we have?

16:18.380 --> 16:20.789
Making a threat in interstate
communications... maybe.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.169
Cyberstalking? That's harder.

16:22.170 --> 16:24.209
Wire fraud. Wire fraud?

16:24.210 --> 16:27.380
We got... nothing, really.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.499
The false report is one charge.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.919
We're preparing
a superseding indictment

16:32.920 --> 16:34.459
with four additional charges...

16:34.460 --> 16:36.249
Making a threat
in interstate communications,

16:36.250 --> 16:38.619
cyberstalking, conspiracy,
wire fraud.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.079
Wire fraud?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.789
Julian isn't gonna
present well to a jury.

16:41.790 --> 16:44.169
He's a kid. He has no criminal
history. He turned himself in.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.459
He's an adult.

16:45.460 --> 16:48.289
He engages in relentlessly
violent rhetoric online.

16:48.290 --> 16:51.499
He's credibly tied to multiple
swatting incidents in the past.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.379
He turned himself in because
he was going to be caught.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.329
What are you offering?
Six years.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.419
This is a kid
who made a phone call.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.709
This is a phone call that killed
a United States Senator.

17:00.710 --> 17:03.329
2 years' probation,
$10,000 fine.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.749
Sarco pleads guilty
to conspiracy

17:04.750 --> 17:06.209
and making a false charge,

17:06.210 --> 17:09.919
we'll recommend 5 years
in prison and a $50,000 fine.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.249
Drop the conspiracy charge,
he'll plead to false report,

17:12.250 --> 17:14.329
1 year in prison, $15,000.

17:14.329 --> 17:15.419
Four years in prison,

17:15.420 --> 17:16.829
and he testifies
against MySoCalledKnife

17:16.829 --> 17:17.999
and anyone else
involved in this.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.460
That's as low as we can go.

17:23.579 --> 17:26.999
That was the easy part.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.879
Four years? He's a teenager.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.829
He... He...
He did something stupid.

17:32.830 --> 17:34.789
He's not a bad kid.

17:34.790 --> 17:35.999
I mean, sometimes
I worried about

17:36.000 --> 17:37.619
how much time he spent
on the computer,

17:37.620 --> 17:40.959
but mostly I liked that
it kept him home, safe,

17:40.960 --> 17:42.459
when I was at work.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.669
I mean, it's just a game, right?

17:44.670 --> 17:48.119
Julian's never touched
a real weapon,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.919
never even got in a fist fight.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.709
Four years in federal prison?

17:53.710 --> 17:55.669
For a phone call?

17:55.670 --> 17:58.039
Four years in prison?

17:58.040 --> 17:59.289
For killing my dad?

17:59.290 --> 18:01.079
It's totally inadequate.
We agree.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.419
But there's no federal law
that covers this kind of thing.

18:04.420 --> 18:08.169
My father is dead.
They shot him.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.419
Right in front of me,
in... in front of my son.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.249
And for what?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.749
Some stupid fight
over a video game?

18:14.750 --> 18:15.959
What kind of sick person thinks

18:15.960 --> 18:17.829
doing something like this
is funny?

18:17.830 --> 18:21.420
How can you sit there and tell
me that's the best you can do?

18:30.170 --> 18:31.539
Why don't you come to bed?

18:31.540 --> 18:33.959
I can't sleep.

18:33.960 --> 18:37.499
I would ask you if you
want to talk about it.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.079
But we don't talk about work.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.669
We can't talk about work.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.419
I don't even like talking about
not talking about work.

18:43.420 --> 18:47.459
In the '92 campaign,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.579
he'd come by the office
every few weeks,

18:49.580 --> 18:51.039
the Senator.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.419
He was very inspirational.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.749
I became a lawyer
because of him.

18:56.750 --> 19:00.959
Senator Carson inspired you to
defend the man who killed him?

19:00.960 --> 19:04.999
Julian didn't kill
Senator Carson.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.079
But, yes...

19:08.080 --> 19:10.040
Life is complicated, isn't it?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.709
Come to bed.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.710
Yes, you're right.

19:30.830 --> 19:34.919
- NYPD! Get on the ground now!
- Freeze!

19:34.920 --> 19:37.119
- Get down!
- Crawl!

19:37.120 --> 19:39.379
- Roger!
- Don't move! Hey! Hey!

19:39.380 --> 19:40.749
- She's unarmed. She's unarmed!
- Get on the ground!

19:40.750 --> 19:43.250
- Ma'am, on the ground now!
- Face forward!

19:44.330 --> 19:46.119
- Hands behind your back!
- Face forward!

19:46.120 --> 19:47.080
- Do it now!
- Do you want to get shot?!

19:47.081 --> 19:48.959
- Move your hands.
- Don't move!

19:48.960 --> 19:50.709
- Keep your hands where we can see them.
- Do not move.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.540
I will shoot you.

19:54.330 --> 19:56.330
Okay. All right.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.669
Are you okay?

20:08.670 --> 20:09.919
I'm fine.

20:09.920 --> 20:10.959
Do we know anything...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.169
The call came
from Holland, Michigan.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.120
My press conference, apparently.

20:13.121 --> 20:14.209
The FBI is on it.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.419
You said someone offered Julian

20:16.420 --> 20:18.789
online currency
in exchange for swatting?

20:18.790 --> 20:21.619
Yes, 475 Bloodoons.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.419
That's the currency
in the video game.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.249
Well, if Julian was paid
to make the 911 call,

20:26.250 --> 20:27.709
we can get him
on murder-for-hire.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.619
It was online currency.
Not real money.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.209
The statute doesn't say
"real money."

20:32.210 --> 20:34.669
it says murder in exchange for
"anything of pecuniary value."

20:34.670 --> 20:37.169
What is the "pecuniary value"
of a Bloodoon?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.619
Well, it must be something,
or people wouldn't kill for it.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.959
You're talking about murder,
malice, intent to kill.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.459
Where is the intent?

20:43.460 --> 20:45.419
It's where he says
he intends to kill.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.999
In a video game...
To a real person.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.119
Murder-for-hire
is a capital offense...

20:49.120 --> 20:50.959
Are you gonna
do your job or not?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.579
I am doing my job.
This is my job.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.789
I'm trying to determine
the appropriate charges.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.709
I understand
what happened last night

20:58.710 --> 20:59.749
was deeply upsetting, but...

20:59.750 --> 21:02.039
No, you don't understand.
At all.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.499
And I don't blame you for that.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.879
We're up here, all day,
every day, on the 20th floor,

21:05.880 --> 21:07.289
staring at computer screens,

21:07.290 --> 21:08.669
reading files,
looking at photos,

21:08.670 --> 21:10.379
making decisions
about people's lives.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.249
Above it all. Literally.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.999
But this work is not bloodless,
and we should not be.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.619
We're not machines.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.209
We don't just plug in facts
and spit out charges.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.999
We use our discretion.
We work for justice.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.289
On the ground. For the people.

21:26.290 --> 21:27.879
Now, there were over 400
swatting incidents

21:27.880 --> 21:30.499
in this country last year,
and it's on the rise,

21:30.500 --> 21:32.669
and there is no federal statute
to deal with it.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.249
The congresswoman
who introduced one?

21:34.250 --> 21:37.170
She was swatted.
So what do we do?

21:38.960 --> 21:42.579
Nothing?

21:42.580 --> 21:43.580
Give me the file.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.879
So, I settled the case

21:57.880 --> 21:59.829
with a 34-year-old girl
in pajamas

21:59.830 --> 22:01.039
squatting in her parents' house,

22:01.040 --> 22:01.880
and I'm ready
for something else.

22:01.881 --> 22:03.539
Anything else.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.419
I was gonna jump in and
help Allison on a few things.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.169
You have your choice of
health care benefits fraud,

22:07.170 --> 22:11.119
bribery, or conspiracy to steal
bioengineered rice seeds.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.669
Lot of nice options here.

22:12.670 --> 22:16.119
I can do you one better.
Mail theft. Just came in.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
For you, Jay.

22:17.121 --> 22:18.499
Mail theft?

22:18.500 --> 22:19.619
Who steals mail?

22:19.620 --> 22:21.619
I was trying to make some money.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.079
By stealing mail?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.879
You say "mail" like these are
letters from "The Notebook."

22:25.880 --> 22:27.879
These are like catalogues
and stupid bills

22:27.880 --> 22:30.539
and rando envelopes laying
around the co-op mailroom.

22:30.540 --> 22:31.879
That's mail!

22:31.880 --> 22:34.499
From which I am making art,
which I will sell,

22:34.500 --> 22:37.959
because my parents are being
even more lame than usual.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.749
How did the mail police
even know I was doing this?

22:40.750 --> 22:43.119
It was on your Instagram.
The art.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.169
Right. That's cool.

22:45.170 --> 22:46.419
No, it's not cool.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.169
I'm gonna talk
to the prosecutor again.

22:48.170 --> 22:49.329
He's reasonable.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.959
You should be grateful.
Not all of them are.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.459
We had a deal... four years.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.459
And now he's charging
murder-for-hire and conspiracy

22:56.460 --> 22:58.289
and three other new charges

22:58.290 --> 23:00.289
that, alone,
could mean 8 to 12 years.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.539
This is about last night,
isn't it?

23:02.540 --> 23:03.749
Getting swatted.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.829
I'm sure it is.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.209
Julian had nothing
to do with that...

23:06.210 --> 23:09.419
I know. It's emotional.
It's punitive, I know.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.209
But Roger has the right
to charge

23:11.210 --> 23:12.249
whatever he thinks he can prove,

23:12.250 --> 23:13.749
and if he thinks
he can prove this...

23:13.750 --> 23:14.959
Can't you talk to him, though?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.120
You guys have a relationship.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.999
Well, I don't mean that.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.829
I wasn't suggesting...
I just... I just meant maybe

23:21.830 --> 23:23.789
you can talk some sense into him
because this is insane.

23:23.790 --> 23:25.459
A few cops show up to his house,

23:25.460 --> 23:26.749
tell him to put his hands up...
Sandra...

23:26.750 --> 23:28.459
which is what our clients
deal with every day...

23:28.460 --> 23:31.039
It's not "a few cops," okay?!

23:31.040 --> 23:33.419
He had semi-automatic weapons

23:33.420 --> 23:36.579
jammed into
the side of his head.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.539
Have you ever been through
something like that?

23:38.540 --> 23:41.959
Police screaming at you?
All at the same time?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.959
And you can't move,
you can't talk.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.170
Because those things might
get you shot in your home.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.789
Don't be glib.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.459
I'm sorry.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.999
These are the charges.
This is the case.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.880
We work the case.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.379
You filed the new charges.

24:05.380 --> 24:06.380
Yes.

24:06.381 --> 24:07.789
I don't agree
with that decision.

24:07.790 --> 24:08.919
I know. I don't care.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.709
I will continue
to work on the case,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.249
but when it comes to sentencing...
No.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.419
I feel strongly about the
application of the death penalty...

24:14.420 --> 24:16.619
No, you will not continue
to work on the case.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.379
You're taking me off the case?

24:18.380 --> 24:19.619
Yes.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.119
Because I disagreed with you?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.580
'Cause I have someone else
working on it now.

24:28.210 --> 24:30.120
Welcome home, Mr. Knox.

24:35.420 --> 24:36.330
- I don't want to hear it.
- It was too hot down there.

24:36.331 --> 24:37.419
You have to breathe
through your mouth.

24:37.420 --> 24:38.669
Don't try to charm
your way out of this.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.289
It's not charming.
It's the opposite of charming.

24:40.290 --> 24:41.830
What's the opposite of charming?
Seth.

24:43.330 --> 24:44.749
How did this even happen?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.119
I called him,
like you told me to.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.329
I didn't tell you to call him
and take my case.

24:48.330 --> 24:49.419
I didn't call him
and take your case.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.579
I called him,
he told me about the case

24:50.580 --> 24:51.789
and said you didn't
want to add the charges.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.419
I didn't. So what's the problem?

24:53.420 --> 24:55.539
You couldn't have told me
you were coming back?

24:55.540 --> 24:56.959
It all happened so fast.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.539
You quit your job
as Solicitor General of Texas,

24:59.540 --> 25:02.459
you packed, you bought tickets,
you flew on an airplane...

25:02.460 --> 25:03.619
I didn't want you
to talk me out of it.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.580
When have I ever
talked you out of anything?

25:09.580 --> 25:11.379
I shouldn't have left
in the first place.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.579
I had a choice. I chose Texas.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.999
That was a mistake
for lots of reasons.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.789
I realized that, and this
was a chance to get back.

25:17.790 --> 25:19.209
I thought... I thought
I'd be helping you.

25:19.210 --> 25:20.709
You didn't do this for me.

25:20.710 --> 25:23.209
What if I did?

25:23.210 --> 25:27.169
Well, then,
you made another mistake.

25:27.170 --> 25:29.539
And this case sucks, by the way.

25:29.540 --> 25:32.419
Sucks.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.379
If you had any capacity
to be ashamed of yourself,

25:34.380 --> 25:35.380
you would be.

25:35.381 --> 25:36.790
You will be.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.169
This is my office.

25:48.170 --> 25:50.209
It was, yes.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.999
I'm sure it's been
many people's office.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.379
I'm sorry.
Are you just visiting, or...

25:53.380 --> 25:56.120
No, I'm back.
Is that an Elvis clock?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.459
Pretty cool, right? No.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.209
Hey, I'm gonna need
you to clear out of here.

26:01.210 --> 26:02.579
You're back working here?

26:02.580 --> 26:05.079
Roger brought me back to
work on the Julian Sarco case.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.669
He called you back from Texas?
Yes.

26:07.670 --> 26:10.459
From Texas?

26:10.460 --> 26:14.079
I'm right here,
right not in Texas,

26:14.080 --> 26:17.419
working on mail theft,
and he brings you back?

26:17.420 --> 26:19.579
Look, dude, I'm sorry. I am.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.669
I don't know. Not my call.

26:22.670 --> 26:24.249
If you'd get all your stuff out
by the end of the day,

26:24.250 --> 26:25.669
that'd be best.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.249
Nobody told you, did they?

26:27.250 --> 26:28.999
What? Who you're up against.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.249
No.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.619
Because I don't care
who I'm up against.

26:32.620 --> 26:36.210
That's why I have the case
and you don't.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.329
I'm back.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.749
I see that.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.209
I'm sorry.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.579
If you want to be the best,

27:00.580 --> 27:03.210
you want to go up
against the best.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.249
I'm sure I'll have another
chance at that with Kate.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.080
But, anyway, here we are.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.789
Welcome back.

27:13.790 --> 27:15.789
Agent Vinuza, you've had
a chance to review

27:15.790 --> 27:17.789
the correspondence
in WorldWarBlood

27:17.790 --> 27:19.539
between the defendant,
Mr. Sarco,

27:19.540 --> 27:21.999
and another gamer who uses
the handle MySoCalledKnife?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.999
That's correct.
In that correspondence,

27:24.000 --> 27:25.959
did Mr. Sarco
ever explicitly threaten

27:25.960 --> 27:27.169
to kill MySoCalledKnife?

27:27.170 --> 27:28.999
He did. Repeatedly.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.379
He said he would "waste him,"
"kill his sorry ass,"

27:31.380 --> 27:32.789
that the "dudes who show up
at your house"

27:32.790 --> 27:35.710
are going to be ready to cap.
Keep your hands up."

27:37.540 --> 27:39.579
Agent Vinuza, WorldWarBlood has

27:39.580 --> 27:41.879
a feature called
"M-Cloud," correct? Yes.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.379
And M-Cloud is when

27:43.380 --> 27:45.709
you drop a nuclear bomb
on one of your opponents?

27:45.710 --> 27:48.079
That's correct. M-Cloud
stands for "Mushroom Cloud."

27:48.080 --> 27:50.249
Isn't it true that Mr. Sarco
repeatedly threatened

27:50.250 --> 27:52.749
to "M-Cloud" MySoCalledKnife?
Yes.

27:52.750 --> 27:55.209
Didn't Mr. Sarco
tell MySoCalledKnife,

27:55.210 --> 27:56.999
"I can't wait to see you
beg like a whiny little bitch

27:57.000 --> 27:59.749
when I M-Cloud your whole family"?
Yes.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.419
You don't have any evidence
that Mr. Sarco actually believed

28:02.420 --> 28:04.579
he would or could
detonate a nuclear bomb

28:04.580 --> 28:06.999
in order to kill
MySoCalledKnife, do you?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.289
No, ma'am.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.459
Agent Patel, you're an expert
on cybersecurity

28:11.460 --> 28:14.079
within the FBI, correct?
That's correct.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.080
In your review of this case,

28:15.081 --> 28:17.829
did the gamer KimJunMakeEmSayUn

28:17.830 --> 28:19.669
offer to pay,
and did he in fact pay

28:19.670 --> 28:22.669
the defendant, Mr. Sarco,
to swat the home of Fred Carson,

28:22.670 --> 28:25.379
which resulted in the death
of Senator Walter Carson?

28:25.380 --> 28:27.459
Yes.

28:27.460 --> 28:30.379
Paid in what currency,
Agent Patel?

28:30.380 --> 28:32.169
Bloodoons. I'm sorry? Bloodoons?

28:32.170 --> 28:33.709
Is that a foreign currency?

28:33.710 --> 28:35.079
I'm not familiar
with what country...

28:35.080 --> 28:37.669
Bloodoons is a virtual currency
in WorldWarBlood.

28:37.670 --> 28:38.670
Inside the game?

28:38.671 --> 28:40.419
Yes. I see.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.539
Do Bloodoons have any pecuniary
value outside the game?

28:42.540 --> 28:43.829
No.

28:43.830 --> 28:45.119
So, to be absolutely clear,

28:45.120 --> 28:47.119
I couldn't go to the airport
right now and say,

28:47.120 --> 28:49.079
"I'd like to buy
a one-way ticket to Texas.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.749
Here's a billion Bloodoons"?

28:51.750 --> 28:53.460
I don't think you would
get on that flight.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.829
Agent Tate,
you've had an opportunity

28:58.830 --> 29:00.249
to forensically analyze

29:00.250 --> 29:02.119
the defendant's computer,
phone, tablets,

29:02.120 --> 29:04.459
and other electronic devices
seized in a search of his home?

29:04.460 --> 29:05.879
Yes.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.039
Have you been able to determine

29:07.040 --> 29:08.829
whether the swatting incident
in this case

29:08.830 --> 29:10.999
is the first one
Mr. Sarco has been involved in?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.039
Your Honor.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.039
If I could just have a minute?

29:15.040 --> 29:16.749
You can object to this.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.459
404b. Prior bad acts.
You can keep this out.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.079
I don't want to keep it out.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.169
We're ready to proceed.

29:24.170 --> 29:25.329
Do you have an objection,
Ms. Bell?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.119
No, Your Honor.
The witness may answer.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.499
We believe that
Mr. Sarco has swatted

29:29.500 --> 29:32.499
at least six other times.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.329
Was anyone killed
in any of those incidents?

29:35.330 --> 29:36.330
No.

29:36.331 --> 29:37.919
Physically injured in any way?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.169
No.

29:39.170 --> 29:40.579
So, based on those incidents,

29:40.580 --> 29:42.379
Mr. Sarco would have
no reason to believe

29:42.380 --> 29:44.539
that swatting results in anyone
getting physically injured,

29:44.540 --> 29:46.249
much less killed, correct?

29:46.250 --> 29:48.459
That's difficult for me to say.

29:48.460 --> 29:51.459
Well, Agent Tate, it would be
hard to believe, would it not,

29:51.460 --> 29:54.039
that Mr. Sarco really
intended to kill someone

29:54.040 --> 29:55.879
when the weapon
he was allegedly using

29:55.880 --> 29:58.419
had never previously resulted
in anyone even getting injured?

29:58.420 --> 29:59.959
Objection! Beyond the scope.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.329
Calls for a legal conclusion.

30:01.330 --> 30:02.420
Sustained.

30:05.460 --> 30:08.829
I'm going to fix this.
I'm gonna figure something out.

30:08.830 --> 30:11.250
I know what to do.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.289
Leonard Knox is back?

30:23.290 --> 30:26.579
I guess so. Not sure.

30:26.580 --> 30:27.919
He took your office.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.120
I like the light in here more.

30:30.330 --> 30:33.919
S-So, look,
we're back on Holiday.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.500
"Back on Holiday"!

30:38.670 --> 30:41.669
I did you a favor. Once.

30:41.670 --> 30:42.789
Not again.

30:42.790 --> 30:44.419
Mail theft carries
a maximum of five years.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.169
Whoa, Cobra Kai,
what's going on here?

30:47.170 --> 30:49.249
This jackass comes back,
swipes your office,

30:49.250 --> 30:50.829
and you want to take it out
on the only person in America

30:50.830 --> 30:52.209
still using the U.S. mail?

30:52.210 --> 30:53.919
Save the analysis.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.919
O-Okay. You're right.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.919
Not cool. Not personal.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.920
You want to go
to the mat on this,

30:58.921 --> 31:00.119
I'm good for the fight.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.789
I do think it's a colossal
waste of time,

31:02.790 --> 31:04.579
and I know you're
better than this.

31:04.580 --> 31:06.209
You pick the right fights.

31:06.210 --> 31:08.209
I can make this go away
with the Colgates

31:08.210 --> 31:11.379
so we can both focus
on more important battles...

31:11.380 --> 31:15.580
but that's up to you.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.539
Would you please tell the jury

31:21.540 --> 31:24.119
about the moments leading up
to your father's death?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.919
I was in the kitchen.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.539
My dad, the Senator,

31:27.540 --> 31:29.119
was in the living room
with my son, Jack,

31:29.120 --> 31:30.749
building a balloon car.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.539
We saw flashing lights outside.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.379
I looked out the window, and...

31:36.380 --> 31:37.999
I've never seen
anything like it.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.789
A dozen squad cars, tanks,

31:40.790 --> 31:44.079
officers lined up
with automatic weapons.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.249
We didn't know what the hell
was going on,

31:45.250 --> 31:46.879
and everybody started panicking.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.879
My dad was calling his aides,
trying to get information.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.209
And, in all the chaos, I guess,

31:52.210 --> 31:56.119
Jack must have slipped away,
ran to the front door.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.959
He's 4.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.789
I think he heard "police,"

32:01.790 --> 32:03.960
and he wanted to see the police.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.540
Yeah, he loves police.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.289
Take your time.

32:16.290 --> 32:17.919
Jack opened the door,

32:17.920 --> 32:23.119
and my dad,
he just ran out after him.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.749
Instinct.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.749
He was like that.

32:27.750 --> 32:31.169
He was fearless, protective.

32:31.170 --> 32:34.119
And then it was
like firecrackers.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.289
So loud.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.499
Somebody tackled me,

32:38.500 --> 32:40.119
and somebody else grabbed Jack,

32:40.120 --> 32:43.709
and I... could hear him crying,

32:43.710 --> 32:44.919
screaming for my dad,

32:44.920 --> 32:49.289
and I saw my dad on the ground.

32:49.290 --> 32:50.879
He'd been shot.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.249
He was dead. I knew that.

32:53.250 --> 32:57.499
He was dead.

32:57.500 --> 33:03.379
And then I heard Jack say,
"Grandpa, get up.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.960
Come inside."

33:09.210 --> 33:13.620
That's what I heard my son say
when he looked at my dad.

33:22.790 --> 33:25.579
The killing of Senator
Walter Carson was a tragedy,

33:25.580 --> 33:28.789
but it was not an accident.

33:28.790 --> 33:32.419
It is critical
that you remember this.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.379
What Fred Carson saw
on the porch of his house

33:35.380 --> 33:36.789
was the direct consequence

33:36.790 --> 33:39.999
of Julian Sarco's words
and actions.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.919
This was exactly
what he intended to do.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.789
This was why he called 911.

33:43.790 --> 33:45.789
"Waste him,"
"kill his sorry ass,"

33:45.790 --> 33:47.789
"send the cops, ready to cap."

33:47.790 --> 33:50.209
That was what he wanted.

33:50.210 --> 33:51.789
It doesn't matter that
he killed the wrong person.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.169
That is irrelevant.

33:53.170 --> 33:56.669
The law requires only
that he intended to kill...

33:56.670 --> 33:59.119
and he did.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.079
MySoCalledKnife was an opponent,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.079
and he was trying to
kill that opponent.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.249
In real life. In the game.
It didn't matter to him.

34:06.250 --> 34:10.248
Because there was
no difference to him.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.879
M-Cloud, swat?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.918
These are just moves
against another character.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.579
And that's what
MySoCalledKnife was...

34:15.580 --> 34:17.789
A character, not a person.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.789
Julian never met him,
never talked to him,

34:19.790 --> 34:22.208
doesn't have any idea what
he looks like, doesn't care.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.079
He's a character,

34:25.080 --> 34:29.458
and Julian wanted to destroy him
in any way that he could.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.040
That's the world
Julian lives in.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.380
But that's not the world
we live in.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.289
We live in the real world,

34:40.290 --> 34:45.079
where people bleed
and children cry,

34:45.080 --> 34:51.668
where there is real loss
and deep pain.

34:51.670 --> 34:55.080
Where people die
and don't get up.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.669
I understand why the government

34:59.670 --> 35:02.379
brought this case
against Julian.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.329
The circumstances
of Senator Carson's death

35:04.330 --> 35:07.579
are tragic and frustrating

35:07.580 --> 35:11.209
and, in many ways, inexplicable.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.379
How could this happen?
How could we let this happen?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.619
Who can we blame?

35:16.620 --> 35:21.789
Julian made a mistake,
but no one honestly believes...

35:21.790 --> 35:23.749
Least of all the fine lawyers
who filed these charges...

35:23.750 --> 35:26.119
That Julian is
legally responsible

35:26.120 --> 35:27.669
for Senator Carson's death.

35:27.670 --> 35:29.289
No, these charges were filed

35:29.290 --> 35:32.669
to make an example
out of Julian.

35:32.670 --> 35:36.379
To say, "This stops here,"
and I agree.

35:36.380 --> 35:40.119
We ought to take what happened
as a cautionary tale,

35:40.120 --> 35:42.709
as an invitation for someone
to assume responsibility

35:42.710 --> 35:45.879
for the troubled world
Mr. Knox so ably describes.

35:45.880 --> 35:51.329
But we should take
responsibility for this.

35:51.330 --> 35:54.329
Because his world,
it is our world.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.749
That is the world we live in.

35:56.750 --> 35:59.959
We drop bombs on places
halfway around the globe

35:59.960 --> 36:02.879
from suburban office parks
a few miles from here.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.419
We blast pictures of people
we've never met online.

36:05.420 --> 36:08.919
We destroy reputations
with keystrokes.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.249
We lead lives, many of us...

36:12.250 --> 36:14.249
All of us in one way
or another...

36:14.250 --> 36:18.749
That are detached,
artificial, simulated,

36:18.750 --> 36:22.539
with fake money
and fake friends,

36:22.540 --> 36:26.119
fake violence, fake love.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.999
Julian didn't create this.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.579
If we're going to make a change,

36:32.580 --> 36:35.379
if we're going to make
ourselves human again,

36:35.380 --> 36:38.419
if we're going to accept
responsibility

36:38.420 --> 36:43.579
for how disconnected and
disassociated we've become...

36:43.580 --> 36:46.789
let's do it together.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.959
Don't point at Julian

36:49.960 --> 36:54.710
and say he is that
and we are not.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.919
Mom? Dad?
What are you doing here?

37:06.920 --> 37:10.079
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

37:10.080 --> 37:12.749
Okay, let's go ahead
and stop that right now.

37:12.750 --> 37:16.169
We are all here because we're
gonna have a talk together,

37:16.170 --> 37:18.789
and I'm gonna go first,
and then we can all leave.

37:18.790 --> 37:20.789
So, Holiday, your parents
are the ones turning you in.

37:20.790 --> 37:22.459
Stoppppppp!

37:22.460 --> 37:23.829
Is that true?

37:23.830 --> 37:25.039
It is true.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.619
They are turning you in

37:26.620 --> 37:28.419
because they don't want you
to live at home anymore.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.419
Now, let's talk about that.

37:30.420 --> 37:32.209
I live at home with my parents.

37:32.210 --> 37:34.419
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Ms. Colgate, but it's true.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.619
I live with my parents.
Always have.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.499
There's nothing wrong
with living with your parents.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.379
All around the world,
people live with their parents

37:40.380 --> 37:42.919
and grandparents,
uncles and aunts.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.289
There is nothing wrong
with living with your parents

37:45.290 --> 37:47.419
if it works for everyone.

37:47.420 --> 37:49.039
I like living at home,

37:49.040 --> 37:51.209
and my parents like
having me at home.

37:51.210 --> 37:53.459
I think.
I need to check on that.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.669
Now, look, someday,
I might have to move out,

37:55.670 --> 37:58.499
but living at home
is not the problem here.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.619
The problem is
you aren't communicating.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.119
You say you want her to leave,

38:03.120 --> 38:07.119
but you're the ones who insisted
she come back after college,

38:07.120 --> 38:08.499
you make her breakfast
every morning,

38:08.500 --> 38:10.709
and you both complain to her
about one another.

38:10.710 --> 38:12.669
You use her.

38:12.670 --> 38:15.879
You... are whiny
and unappreciative,

38:15.880 --> 38:18.079
and you need an actual job,
and you need to grow up,

38:18.080 --> 38:20.169
and you really,
really need to put pants on.

38:20.170 --> 38:22.039
Real pants. Pants.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.080
This is not hard.

38:28.540 --> 38:34.579
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad,
and not just about the pants.

38:34.580 --> 38:38.579
Your parents love you, Holiday,
and you love them.

38:38.580 --> 38:39.999
However twisted it all looks,

38:40.000 --> 38:41.959
I do believe
you love each other.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.749
Now, here's the score...

38:43.750 --> 38:47.169
The prosecutor has agreed
to drop these charges,

38:47.170 --> 38:49.379
but that won't happen next time,

38:49.380 --> 38:52.169
so don't let there be
a next time, okay?

38:52.170 --> 38:53.379
I have a lot of hope for you.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.749
I have faith in you.
I believe in you.

38:55.750 --> 39:00.079
And I don't ever, ever want
to see any of you ever again.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.420
Great talk.

39:04.460 --> 39:06.749
I understand the jury has
reached a unanimous verdict.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.419
Yes, Your Honor.

39:08.420 --> 39:12.829
In the case of the United States
v. Julian Sarco,

39:12.830 --> 39:14.209
how do you find the defendant

39:14.210 --> 39:17.209
on Count One, murder-for-hire?

39:17.210 --> 39:18.620
Not guilty.

39:20.670 --> 39:22.459
With respect to Count Two,

39:22.460 --> 39:24.999
making a false report
to emergency services

39:25.000 --> 39:27.249
resulting in death of another,

39:27.250 --> 39:28.210
how do you find the defendant...

39:28.211 --> 39:29.619
Guilty or not guilty?

39:29.620 --> 39:31.829
Guilty.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.829
With respect to Count Three,

39:33.830 --> 39:37.209
conspiracy to make a false
report to emergency services

39:37.210 --> 39:40.169
resulting in death of another,
how do you find the defendant...

39:40.170 --> 39:41.749
Guilty or not guilty?

39:41.750 --> 39:43.379
Guilty.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.579
With respect to Count Four,

39:45.580 --> 39:47.999
making a threat
in interstate communications,

39:48.000 --> 39:52.169
how do you find the defendant...
Guilty or not guilty?

39:52.170 --> 39:53.920
Guilty.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.289
You might not have
realized this yet,

40:12.290 --> 40:13.459
but things are different
around here now,

40:13.460 --> 40:15.039
and I'm taking back this office.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.789
Not because it has a window,

40:16.790 --> 40:18.959
though I have enjoyed watching
all the little cars go by,

40:18.960 --> 40:21.039
but because I earned it.

40:21.040 --> 40:28.419
You left, I was here,
I am here, and I earned this.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.500
This is my office.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.710
Okay.

41:08.670 --> 41:10.499
I'm sorry.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.289
Don't.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.420
I just wanted to say thank you.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.879
He's my boy.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.710
You defended him.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.750
I wanted to say thank you.
