00:06.881 --> 00:08.883
[theme music plays]

00:26.401 --> 00:27.819
[light buzzing]

00:36.286 --> 00:37.662
[buzzing intensifies]

00:40.957 --> 00:43.418
I got a letter inviting me
to a college interview,

00:44.169 --> 00:46.379
from a college
I didn't remember applying to.

00:46.463 --> 00:52.010
And then I did remember writing an essay
about confessing to covering up a murder.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.094
[swallows loudly]

00:53.178 --> 00:55.346
I didn't mean to send it.
Somebody else did.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.515
And I got the interview.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.768
It's a crazy world, right?

00:59.851 --> 01:02.395
[rattling, footsteps]

01:07.192 --> 01:09.152
So, anyway,
I have a college interview today.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.822
-I have to go.
-[man] Yeah.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.825
-I can't miss it.
-Well, I'll be sure to tell the doctor.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.248
I mean,
I know I have some marks on my record,

01:23.041 --> 01:25.627
and I've... I've had a lot of struggles,

01:25.710 --> 01:29.255
but I guess my hope would be
to start over.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.301
You know,
to be the person that I know I can be.

01:33.384 --> 01:37.055
I think you'll find a lot of kids
at a school for the arts like ours

01:37.138 --> 01:39.766
have had challenging
high school experiences.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.811
And they come into their own
in college.

01:42.894 --> 01:46.481
Yeah, I mean, like, there's more to me
that people don't know yet.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.984
-[recruiter] Your work is very good.
-Thank you.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.279
Tell me about the guns.
You make them look, um...

01:56.699 --> 01:57.575
elegant.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.787
I think guns can be beautiful.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.124
The way they look,
along with what they can do.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.083
It's...

02:06.167 --> 02:09.212
I mean, you can be attracted to them.

02:09.754 --> 02:10.880
Do you think that's...

02:12.048 --> 02:13.091
healthy?

02:13.174 --> 02:19.013
No. The fact that I put it in a picture
doesn't mean I think it's a good thing.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.056
It's...

02:21.349 --> 02:25.145
[inhales slowly, clicks tongue]
...it's a picture that I needed to take.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.273
That I needed people to see.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.901
I'm actually... I'm scared of guns.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.363
And... and I think they're beautiful.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.576
You know?
And I think a lot of people talk about...

02:40.785 --> 02:45.039
kids are angry, kids are sick,
kids are violent.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.460
But we don't talk
about the more complicated things

02:49.544 --> 02:52.964
like the fact
that we are attracted to guns.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.134
I mean, some people are disgusted by them,
for sure.

02:56.217 --> 03:00.096
But some of us are attracted,
like, drawn to them.

03:00.180 --> 03:05.894
And these pictures are meant to get
people thinking, you know, about why.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.357
[Ellman] ...about the possibility
of self-harm more than anything.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.484
[Matt] Are you?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.029
Concerned about the possibility
of self-harm?

03:16.112 --> 03:18.281
[Ellman] I think it's not a bad idea

03:18.364 --> 03:21.159
that we continue observation
for a period of time.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.869
From the police reports,

03:22.952 --> 03:26.331
it does appear that some sort of breakdown
took place at the school.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.625
The drill was incredibly stressful,

03:28.708 --> 03:29.959
and not just for Clay.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.174
[footsteps approaching]

03:41.304 --> 03:42.347
Hey.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.019
[sniffs] How do you feel?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.732
They're gonna keep me here, aren't they?

03:53.358 --> 03:54.234
[Justin] Yeah.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.322
I was arguing about it with them. I was...
I was yelling about it a minute ago.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.408
So I guess...

04:04.285 --> 04:07.163
congrats. You are full-on the good son.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.122
Dude, come...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.250
Come on, man.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.044
I'm sorry.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.129
I'm sorry that...

04:16.130 --> 04:18.049
that I haven't been there to help you.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.428
I'm sorry that shit's so wrong.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.224
I'm not crazy.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.603
I'm just scared.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.563
Yeah, man.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.692
[Ellman] It's troubling, but I do think
we have to trust the process.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.776
I am too.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.489
Do you, uh,
want me to stay with you today?

04:41.572 --> 04:42.490
No.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.743
[Ellman] I know a doctor
you can stay in close touch with

04:46.327 --> 04:47.370
until his release.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.913
I'm kind of...

04:52.208 --> 04:53.293
embarrassed.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.423
-Good morning, sunshine.
-[whispers] Hi.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.092
Dad, we talked about "sunshine."

05:01.175 --> 05:03.469
[chuckles] See, classic Clay. He's fine.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.139
[Lainie]
The doctors would feel more comfortable

05:06.222 --> 05:11.185
if they kept an eye on you
for just a little while longer. OK?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.479
"OK," as in I get a vote?

05:13.563 --> 05:16.649
[chuckles] We'll get you out of here
as soon as we can.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.990
[Jess] I gotta figure out
what's up with Clay.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.950
People are blaming me

05:26.034 --> 05:30.330
like I had something to do
with this drill. It's crazy. [sighs]

05:30.413 --> 05:33.041
No one thinks you had anything to do
with that drill.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.376
-[scoffs]
-Or that crazy motherfucker Clay.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
Hey, don't call him crazy.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.130
I'm sorry.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.007
Just come back to bed.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.425
[tapping phone keys]

05:42.884 --> 05:45.178
-[sighs]
-Hey, where you at?

05:45.636 --> 05:47.013
-Huh?
-[chuckles] What?

05:47.096 --> 05:49.098
[speaking Spanish]

05:49.182 --> 05:50.391
[groans appreciatively]

05:52.226 --> 05:54.228
-[speaking Spanish]
-Mm.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.813
Oh, my God.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.775
That Latin lover thing is such a trope,
Diego.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.235
It... The what now?

06:04.405 --> 06:06.157
-Oh, you really don't know?
-No.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.619
-You're so pretty.
-[chuckles]

06:09.702 --> 06:11.579
-[laughs]
-[Ani] Hello?

06:11.662 --> 06:14.665
Oh, shit!
I, uh... I forgot that Ani's back today.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.875
-Achola?
-Yep, yep.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.002
She lives here sometimes.
You gotta get out of here.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.379
-Come on.
-What? I got no clothes.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.130
Here, just come on, go.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.799
-Go!
-I got no clothes!

06:22.882 --> 06:25.802
Go! Get dressed on your way out!
Go! Oh, sorry!

06:26.344 --> 06:27.887
[door creaking]

06:28.471 --> 06:31.349
-Good morning.
-Hi! Welcome back.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.101
[suspenseful music plays]

06:34.519 --> 06:36.521
[Winston] I think Jessica Davis knows.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.439
See, look here.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.110
Monty and someone are writing
back and forth using a number.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.904
"Twenty-one basically told me he did it.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.616
Twenty-one,
using the drugs Bryce gave him."

06:50.201 --> 06:51.327
So I guessed.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.704
What if that's a jersey number?

06:57.375 --> 06:58.376
Twenty-one.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.003
Twenty-one.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.798
Justin Foley.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.512
Diego is gonna try
to get it out of Zach today.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.890
And you think Jessica knows?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.350
She has to.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.561
I don't think she would lie to me.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.230
-To protect her boyfriend?
-[Estela] I just...

07:19.897 --> 07:21.566
I thought we were friends.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.444
Me and her.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.154
[Estela inhales slowly]

07:30.616 --> 07:33.077
[Diaz] Bolan thinks it was more
than the lockdown.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.079
He's still under observation.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.835
They did an initial evaluation,
and he's not psychotic.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.589
So they're in crisis management
to see if they need to commit him.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.175
[Bill] They don't think
he needs inpatient?

07:47.258 --> 07:48.217
[Diaz] Don't know yet.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.221
And I don't know
if it's just about the drill, or...

07:52.638 --> 07:55.766
-[Bill] Well, what else would it be about?
-[Diaz] Well...

07:57.310 --> 08:00.521
I've been wanting to ask you a few things
about the Walker case.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.856
[Bill] The Walker case?

08:02.940 --> 08:04.233
[Diaz] Yeah, I'm just...

08:05.109 --> 08:06.694
dotting the I's and all that.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.280
Making sure we have the whole picture.

08:10.114 --> 08:14.076
And since there's no audio or video
from the Achola girl's statement,

08:14.744 --> 08:17.538
I was hoping you could help me out
with a few questions.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.456
[Bill] Yeah.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.292
The officers subdued him.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.377
[stutters] Clay had a gun in his hand!

08:23.461 --> 08:24.962
They beat the shit out of him.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.256
Jessica, Clay was violently upset.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.426
He was not coherent, and he was armed.
The officers had to respond.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.386
We were all violently upset.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.889
We were fucking terrified!

08:34.972 --> 08:40.019
Right. The intent of the drill was
to evaluate student and staff response

08:40.102 --> 08:41.562
to an actual crisis.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.608
Whatever the intent was, the response is
that we were fucking freaked out.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.902
And now we're pissed off. Everyone is.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.321
I thought you and I agreed
safety was the priority.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.450
Do you really think
that Clay is safer now?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.161
I'm sorry about Clay.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.372
I really am.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.749
[sighs]

09:07.547 --> 09:12.093
But I think there's more going on there
than just a lockdown.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.600
[sighs]

09:20.226 --> 09:23.437
There's a petition going around
saying that I should resign.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.484
That I wanted this crazy drill,

09:28.568 --> 09:32.196
and the cameras, and the metal detectors.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.615
Nobody knows about our conversations.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.368
But they know that I haven't spoken up.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.537
Do you think you should?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.289
Speak up?

09:42.373 --> 09:44.834
Do you think
it would make things better or worse?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.007
You know, they asked me
at my interview this morning...

09:54.135 --> 09:56.679
They asked me,
"What's the most stressful situation

09:56.762 --> 09:58.598
you've faced in your time here?"

10:00.891 --> 10:02.727
Of all the things I could have said,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.271
all the fucked-up shit that's happened,

10:06.731 --> 10:09.942
you know what I thought of?
[slams cutter down, inhales deeply]

10:11.777 --> 10:12.695
You.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.032
You and Clay.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.828
Wondering if my friends
are really just that: friends.

10:21.287 --> 10:26.292
Wondering if I'm gonna lose them
or... or if they're gonna give up on me.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.669
[slams cutter down, breathes heavily]

10:28.753 --> 10:29.754
I guess I know now.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.839
[Tony] No one's giving up on you, Tyler.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.051
But what is going on?
Why were you shopping for guns?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.928
Do you think the last year,
everything we've been through,

10:38.012 --> 10:39.972
does that all just mean nothing to you?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.975
Do you think I can, just like that,
just go back to where I was,

10:43.059 --> 10:47.897
just where I was before you guys
all reached out and helped me?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.107
Before I worked so hard to get better?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.611
-You think all of that can just go away?
-I hope not.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.071
Then why go through my stuff?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.156
I was doing
what I thought was the right thing.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.910
[angrily] You could have ruined my life.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.457
[Diego] Hey.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.378
Winston said you guys bonded
during the lockdown yesterday.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.006
Mostly just got stoned.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.300
No, he said
you got some shit off your chest.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.594
Some very interesting shit.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.850
The fuck do you want?

11:24.934 --> 11:26.268
Tell me the story.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.563
Sounds like you've already heard it.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.359
I think you're protecting
one of your friends. Like Clay is.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.279
You saw how that turned out for him,
right?

11:39.323 --> 11:43.077
You know, you're supposed to be, like,
this big stand-up guy,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.745
and you're keeping that secret?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.497
That's fucked up, Dempsey.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.127
Yeah, that's... that's worse
than anything any other guy did.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.505
Come on, man. Just come clean.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.590
Cleanse your soul.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.177
Or... pay the price.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.806
You've always been able to talk, Diego.
You know that?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.684
But when it comes time to play,

12:07.184 --> 12:08.602
the talk don't mean shit.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.438
Oh, yeah?

12:10.521 --> 12:11.397
Hmm.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.817
We'll see.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.527
[tense music plays]

12:23.492 --> 12:25.453
[Jess] Justin, I really gotta go.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.456
[Jess moans]

12:29.665 --> 12:31.834
How was this morning? Are you OK?

12:32.960 --> 12:33.836
No.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.255
How's Clay?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.258
He's not OK.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.636
Nothing is.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.141
Zach told Winston that he beat up Bryce.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.727
Fuck! Uh...

12:50.644 --> 12:52.730
-What?
-Winston told Diego.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.066
So you're... you're still seeing Diego?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.110
He's, like, on a damn mission. I...

12:58.569 --> 13:01.030
I can't just drop him.
I have to handle shit.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.700
OK, but is that all this is?
It's just you handling him, or whatever?

13:05.075 --> 13:05.993
Yes.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.038
[tense music plays]

13:13.334 --> 13:14.251
Help.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.129
Ple... Please help.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.633
What? What is it?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.593
[weakly] I shit the bed.

13:23.010 --> 13:23.969
Oh, man.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.972
I'm sorry. Uh, hold on.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.767
-[Clay] Please?
-[unbuckles restraints] Yeah, hold on.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.060
[gasps]

13:31.143 --> 13:32.978
OK, we'll get you in the shower.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.816
I can't leave you alone, so I will wait
until you've finished your business.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
[nurse whispers]
Oh, man, what a mess.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.914
[door closes]

13:59.046 --> 14:00.923
[nurse] We need some sheets in here.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.591
Taylor?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.805
You gotta crack the door, man.
I have to be able to hear you.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.432
Taylor?

14:10.516 --> 14:11.475
Anyone?

14:15.229 --> 14:17.231
[thrilling music plays]

14:43.716 --> 14:44.800
[Justin] He left?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.305
You mean he escaped?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.264
[Diaz] Yes.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.975
-How?
-Still unclear.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.188
Justin,
I know that Clay and I have history,

14:59.273 --> 15:00.691
but I am still here for him.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.775
And I'm worried.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.112
He's in a fragile mental state.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.157
Yeah, you can thank Bolan for that.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.868
It's not safe for him
to be alone right now.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.412
He could act out violently.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.830
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.873
Not even himself?

15:20.377 --> 15:23.130
-Do you know where Clay is?
-I have no idea.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.216
[clicks tongue]

15:26.717 --> 15:28.719
But anywhere's safer than this school.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.722
[Diaz sighs]

15:35.809 --> 15:39.313
Actually, I don't know if we ever even,
like, liked each other.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.564
I mean, I...

15:40.648 --> 15:44.276
I mean, I loved her, I think.
I don't... Er... I don't know.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.780
I guess... I think I loved her.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.699
Hey!

15:51.659 --> 15:52.785
Um, hey.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.244
-Welcome back.
-Hello.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.371
[sighs]

15:55.454 --> 15:56.413
You look...

15:58.165 --> 16:01.085
How are you doing?
I heard about the drill.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.212
And the hospital.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.215
Yeah. No, I'm... I'm good. I'm good.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.636
[clicks tongue] Um...

16:10.719 --> 16:12.346
They... they let me out, so...

16:14.014 --> 16:18.143
Just... I'm just not ready to go back
to school yet, you know?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
[Ani] OK.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.816
What was it you wanted to talk about?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.943
Did you send my application?

16:27.152 --> 16:30.823
-Because they invited me to an interview.
-That's great!

16:32.408 --> 16:33.325
So, you...

16:34.743 --> 16:37.121
[chuckles incredulously]

16:37.204 --> 16:39.957
[pants] How is that great?

16:41.041 --> 16:46.296
I wrote my essay about covering up
a fucking murder, Ani!

16:46.380 --> 16:47.840
I wasn't actually gonna send it in.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.968
So you sent it, and they gave it
to the police, who set up this interview.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.803
-Jesus, Clay. Breathe.
-Oh, shit.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.723
I'm not stupid. I rewrote the essay.

16:56.306 --> 17:01.353
I talked about how building robots is...
is a metaphor for overcoming setbacks.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.607
And now they want to meet with you.
So, you're welcome.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.946
God, Ani. Fuck!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.990
When are you gonna stop? You know?

17:13.073 --> 17:15.492
When are you gonna stop
trying to run people's lives?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.453
[exhales sharply]

17:19.705 --> 17:20.789
How about now?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.293
I'll stop now.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.712
And my mum's fine.

17:27.796 --> 17:28.964
Thanks for asking.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.050
Shit, wait. How is your mom? I--

17:31.133 --> 17:32.134
Yeah, fine.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.141
-Hey.
-What the f... Who does that?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.559
Guys do it. It's a thing.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.979
It's... it's, like, a Titanic,
king-of-the-world kind of thing.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.105
I've seen it done.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.942
OK, well, I'm not Kate Winslet,
and what is even happening here?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.154
Like between us?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.281
Uh...

17:55.365 --> 17:59.953
I guess, uh, I kind of felt like
maybe we would be a thing, you know?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.581
No? Uh... I don't know.

18:02.664 --> 18:06.085
'Cause you're, like, the first actual guy
I've kissed who's, like, kissed me back.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.836
And you're a real non-imaginary person.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.256
OK. Tyler is in school.
Like, nothing happened.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.550
What? How? We...

18:14.051 --> 18:16.095
-What do you mean?
-I don't fucking know.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.847
Tony says we're not supposed
to tell anyone, and he'll deal with it.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.932
And he will.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.185
-Hey.
-Can we just...

18:24.686 --> 18:28.273
[sighs] Look, I have history,
I have my interview later, and...

18:29.316 --> 18:30.234
Yeah.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.276
OK.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.112
[Luke] St. George!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.322
Got the math answers or what?

18:37.157 --> 18:38.575
You should take care of that.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.330
Go.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.435
[eerie music plays over inaudible speech]

19:18.073 --> 19:19.741
[Justin] I texted you twice.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.370
"Gordon Lightfoot. Urgent."

19:25.330 --> 19:27.249
[exhales sharply] Yeah, I'm, uh...

19:29.168 --> 19:30.586
I'm ignoring that shit now.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.340
Did you really tell Winston?

19:36.466 --> 19:39.261
-What the fuck were you thinking?
-That I was gonna die.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.846
We're all gonna fucking die!

19:42.181 --> 19:44.600
Question is, do you wanna die in jail?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.603
You know, I get it, you hate Jess,
but what the fuck about Alex?

19:47.686 --> 19:48.687
I don't hate...

19:51.523 --> 19:53.150
I don't hate anybody, OK?

19:54.151 --> 19:57.696
I didn't mean to make things worse.
I was stoned. I thought I was gonna die.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.782
And that drill was just
so fucked-up, so...

20:00.866 --> 20:03.035
You need to fix this with Diego.

20:03.118 --> 20:03.994
How?

20:04.745 --> 20:05.954
The fuck if I know.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.915
You're the straight-A student.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.959
Yeah, not anymore.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.632
[indistinct chattering]

20:16.715 --> 20:18.300
[officer] All right, listen up.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.761
We got a gun deal set up
with the Down kid.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.520
-Fuck.
-[coach] Tony, hey!

20:30.604 --> 20:33.315
Here we go. I don't know why
they don't do this online.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.484
It's... Boxing's still in the Stone Age.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.070
Your, uh, trainer, Caleb,
he owns the gym, right?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.280
-Yeah, right.
-Well, he needs to fill this out.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.908
Certificate of occupancy,
certificate of insurance.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.452
Then we can schedule the match.
Easy, all good.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.578
OK.

20:46.662 --> 20:50.582
-[woman] Ted, need you in back.
-Got it. All right, get that in ASAP.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.044
'Cause that McConnell kid wants to fight
and he wants to fight right now.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.380
You good? You eating right?

20:56.463 --> 20:57.881
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah? You sure?

20:57.965 --> 20:59.258
-Yeah.
-Pow, pow, pow!

20:59.341 --> 21:02.552
We got it all set up with the Down kid
outside the Blue Spot Tuesday night.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.263
We're gonna need a full tactical team.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.014
[ominous music plays]

21:24.700 --> 21:25.784
[knocking on door]

21:38.213 --> 21:39.214
[door unlocks]

21:40.048 --> 21:40.882
Clay.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.511
It's not appropriate for you to be here.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.346
No, I know. I'm... I'm sorry,

21:46.430 --> 21:49.683
-I didn't know what else to do.
-I'm required to inform the police.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.686
Call the police,
you'll never see me again. [sighs heavily]

21:52.769 --> 21:55.480
I just... I'm so tired.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.151
And I can never sleep,
and I don't want to feel this way anymore.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.571
It's like this buzz in my head
that just keeps getting louder and louder,

22:02.654 --> 22:04.114
and I think it's killing me.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.824
And I don't want to die, and...

22:06.658 --> 22:08.201
I just... I need this to stop.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.204
Can you please help me make it stop?

22:15.792 --> 22:18.086
[exhales slowly] Wait here.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.840
We'll go to my office. We'll talk.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.385
Then we'll both do what we have to do.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.428
All right?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.365
You avoided me at school today.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.867
Skipped our classes.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.412
Yeah,
I needed to take care of a situation.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.997
Now I gotta go, so...

22:55.040 --> 22:55.957
Diego?

22:56.917 --> 22:59.544
Yes. Do you wanna say something about it?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.463
-I don't.
-Mm-hmm.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.631
[Ani] Really.

23:02.714 --> 23:06.009
'Cause I don't think you get
to say anything about who I sleep with.

23:06.593 --> 23:07.969
I know what I'm doing.

23:08.053 --> 23:08.887
I know.

23:08.970 --> 23:13.308
I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me stay.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.312
I'm moving out tonight.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.944
You're going back to Oakland?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.320
No.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.783
Ironically, my mum insists
that I finish the year at Liberty.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.871
She feels like my education's
been interrupted enough by her illness.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.376
Tony said I could stay.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.087
You don't have to.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
I do.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.012
What I did...

23:53.306 --> 23:54.683
[sniffles] ...with Bryce...

23:58.728 --> 24:00.147
was unforgivable.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.571
And I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.823
I didn't mean to.

24:10.907 --> 24:11.908
I didn't.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.662
I wasn't thinking. Full stop.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.249
I was just being a stupid kid.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.005
It's just... [sniffles]

24:25.839 --> 24:27.174
All I know is that...

24:29.634 --> 24:31.052
I guess that I was lonely.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.475
And I didn't think about the consequences.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.147
I think girls do that sometimes.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.567
With boys.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.823
[Jess breathes deeply]

24:54.367 --> 24:56.495
I worry that things have... [sniffles]

24:57.704 --> 24:59.414
...completely fallen apart...

25:01.708 --> 25:02.584
with you and me.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.296
And everything.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.845
[sniffs] And the only thing
that's clear is

25:13.929 --> 25:16.431
that I'm not the person
to put them back together.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.622
Is that a Rickenbacker?

25:42.332 --> 25:43.166
Guild.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.960
Starfire III.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.671
1966.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.975
This time, you take the couch,
I take the chair.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.476
Clay.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.982
It's fine if you want to feel powerful
at this moment. I understand that.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.068
But at some point,
I have to involve the authorities.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.404
You take the couch. I take the chair.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.538
[door closes]

26:32.674 --> 26:34.926
You don't want the chair after all?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.137
I'm supposed to go
to a college interview tomorrow.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.265
You believe that? A college interview.
[chuckles]

26:40.348 --> 26:42.058
And you don't feel ready for that?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.977
I can't just sit there and talk.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.937
I can't even hold still anymore.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.772
Why do you think that is?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.941
It started when I was arrested.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.529
When they moved me from
the sheriff's station to the county jail.

26:55.155 --> 26:59.117
They had me in handcuffs and leg irons,
and they shut me in the back of the van.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.869
No windows, no air, just dark.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.039
Must have been terrifying.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.794
And you felt confined today,
at the hospital?

27:10.295 --> 27:11.713
I just... I had to get out.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.506
Get away. I...

27:13.590 --> 27:15.717
From people who were trying to help you?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.427
I... I just felt afraid.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.933
I've felt so afraid
of so many things for so long.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.481
I mean, I don't even think
I can ever remember not being afraid.

27:29.564 --> 27:30.398
[Ellman] Try.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.150
Try to tell me...

27:33.735 --> 27:35.487
about a time you felt safe.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.988
Taken care of.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.114
[slaps thighs] I...

27:39.199 --> 27:41.076
I don't know. I don't know.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.203
Go as far back as you need to.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.388
I remember this time I was, like,

28:02.472 --> 28:04.683
seven, I think, or eight.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.354
[clicks tongue]
And I had this crazy fever,

28:10.355 --> 28:12.273
like things didn't feel real.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.777
And my dad stayed home
and took care of me.

28:17.153 --> 28:21.616
And I slept on the couch
with our dog, um...

28:22.659 --> 28:23.785
who was, like...

28:25.453 --> 28:27.414
It was like she was guarding me.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.334
And I remember waking up

28:31.418 --> 28:33.962
and my dad was sitting there,

28:35.004 --> 28:35.880
just...

28:38.299 --> 28:41.302
sort of stroking the hair on my head.

28:44.764 --> 28:45.640
[clicks tongue]

28:46.099 --> 28:47.100
And...

28:49.018 --> 28:50.854
he looked so worried, but I...

28:53.231 --> 28:54.482
I didn't feel worried.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.112
I just felt glad he was there.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.616
Why do you think your parents worry?

29:06.703 --> 29:09.205
I don't... I don't want them to.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.624
But why do you think they do?

29:12.542 --> 29:13.543
Because of...

29:14.919 --> 29:16.880
everything I do. Because of the...

29:17.714 --> 29:20.300
the trouble I've caused.
Because I'm not right, I mean...

29:20.717 --> 29:23.428
Do you think if you were perfect,
they'd never worry...

29:25.346 --> 29:29.058
about where you were,
what you were doing, if you were healthy?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.811
Happy? Safe?

29:35.565 --> 29:36.816
I guess they would.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.526
Then when they do,

29:39.027 --> 29:41.070
can you try to remember that feeling

29:41.154 --> 29:42.781
of being glad they're there?

29:44.365 --> 29:45.658
I can try. Yeah.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.952
Then perhaps...

29:48.995 --> 29:52.916
you can start to believe
that there are people in your life...

29:54.834 --> 29:56.377
that wanna take care of you.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.923
That want you to do well.

30:03.176 --> 30:06.638
Parents, teachers, doctors.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.642
Even college interviewers.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.437
I can try.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.362
Sweetheart. [relieved sigh]

30:23.655 --> 30:25.824
[Lainie sniffles]

30:25.907 --> 30:27.867
[Ellman] I've spoken with Sheriff Diaz,

30:27.951 --> 30:30.078
and I don't think Clay is at risk
of self-harm.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.412
He can go home.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.917
He and I have decided
it's best I see him twice a week

30:36.793 --> 30:37.877
for the next while.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.087
Thank you.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.842
Do you want to sleep in the house tonight
instead of out back?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.803
Is Justin home?

30:46.886 --> 30:47.720
Yeah.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.431
Then I'll be fine.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.767
OK.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.192
[Lainie breathes deeply, chuckles] OK.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.033
[suspenseful music plays]

31:26.050 --> 31:28.052
[suspenseful music intensifies]

31:30.847 --> 31:31.931
[Clay gasps]

31:40.189 --> 31:43.568
[woman] They say that resiliency is
the truest predictor of success.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.740
Do they say that?

31:49.240 --> 31:50.158
Mm-hmm.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.077
Huh.

31:55.997 --> 32:01.586
But isn't resiliency just one more way
of saying that we should cope with things

32:01.920 --> 32:03.713
rather than trying to change them?

32:04.797 --> 32:05.715
I, um...

32:05.798 --> 32:07.967
And what does real change look like?

32:15.892 --> 32:18.478
I, um... I had two friends.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.814
Two very different friends.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.150
Two people I love...

32:26.527 --> 32:27.904
who each had a moment...

32:29.364 --> 32:32.992
in their lives
when they looked in their world

32:33.076 --> 32:36.120
and saw that nothing
was ever gonna change.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.247
Ever.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.250
And they each made a decision...

32:42.710 --> 32:44.045
in that one moment.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.673
One...

32:48.800 --> 32:49.842
terrible,

32:51.594 --> 32:53.304
painful decision...

32:56.182 --> 32:58.267
that they could never take back.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.194
And that's what brought the change.

33:11.698 --> 33:12.740
Painful...

33:14.450 --> 33:15.451
awful...

33:16.285 --> 33:17.328
change.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.415
Change is never easy.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.208
[chuckles lightly]

33:23.418 --> 33:24.377
No.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.171
No, no, it isn't.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.216
Thank you for that.

33:36.431 --> 33:40.309
Um, I'm sorry to pull you out of class
like this, buddy, but it's important.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.228
What is it? Is it Clay?

33:43.312 --> 33:45.231
Matt and Lainie gave him the day off.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.816
He... he's still recovering.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.985
Mm-hmm. No, it's not about Clay.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.196
[inhales slowly]

33:52.864 --> 33:54.073
It's about your mom.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.745
It, uh...
it appears she passed away yesterday.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.456
We got the call this morning.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.670
She...

34:08.921 --> 34:09.756
what?

34:09.839 --> 34:12.175
Yeah, she was found by a patrol car.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.719
Routine sweep, down by the docks.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.014
-Seth?
-No, he's still upstate.

34:18.097 --> 34:21.684
We checked with the Bureau of Prisons,
and there's no sign of foul play.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.313
She OD'ed?

34:25.938 --> 34:27.523
There's some evidence for that,

34:28.733 --> 34:31.069
but we're waiting on a toxicology report.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.908
[inhales, exhales deeply]

34:37.325 --> 34:40.161
I know you two hadn't been in touch
for quite some time.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.792
Yeah, um...

34:48.002 --> 34:48.878
we hadn't.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.509
So, so sorry, buddy.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.638
Thank you...

35:01.057 --> 35:02.517
for telling me.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.563
Do you want me to give you a ride home?
To the Jensens?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.443
You should take the day off.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.862
I can talk to Principal Bolan,
tell him what's going on.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.198
If it's all right, sir,

35:19.033 --> 35:20.785
I'd like to stay at school.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.121
I'm...

35:23.955 --> 35:26.415
trying to keep my attendance perfect.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.211
And I've got a college interview today.
[chuckles]

35:31.462 --> 35:32.463
OK.

35:34.006 --> 35:35.591
-Here if you need, OK?
-Mm.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.030
Alex?

36:02.618 --> 36:05.204
I'm sorry, I can't... I can't right now.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.039
Um... [scoffs]

36:07.123 --> 36:09.375
I don't...
I don't deserve to go to college.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.044
Of course you deserve to go to college.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.089
Everyone does, no matter their disability.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.807
How'd it go?

36:24.891 --> 36:26.350
What are you even doing here?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.352
I wanted to see how it went.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.605
Oh, my God,
you're like a fucking golden retriever.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.814
Don't you give up?

36:32.440 --> 36:34.275
No, I'm like, uh... Russell Wilson.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.819
Never giving up on a play,
always scrambling.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.821
So, how'd it go?

36:38.905 --> 36:41.616
It sucked because I'm extremely fucked up,

36:41.699 --> 36:44.452
and if you weren't an idiot,
you'd stay away.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.042
[exhales]

37:02.511 --> 37:04.263
[sighs deeply]

37:07.225 --> 37:09.435
[breathes heavily]

37:13.731 --> 37:14.732
[sniffs]

37:23.074 --> 37:24.367
[sobs quietly]

37:27.119 --> 37:30.248
If, uh, I were to ask one of your friends,

37:30.331 --> 37:33.251
what would they say is
your greatest strength?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.171
I... I suppose they'd say I'm...

37:38.673 --> 37:39.924
very dedicated.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.342
Um...

37:41.634 --> 37:42.551
Loyal.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.765
I'm not... I'm not someone
who gives up on other people very easily.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.767
[chuckles] Hm.

37:51.852 --> 37:52.895
[sighs]

37:55.231 --> 37:57.191
Actually, um, sorry.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.317
Um... Uh...

37:58.401 --> 38:00.069
That's not what they would say...

38:00.653 --> 38:01.988
at all. [chuckles lightly]

38:02.655 --> 38:04.156
[recruiter] What do you mean?

38:05.992 --> 38:06.993
The truth is...

38:09.245 --> 38:12.665
I don't think my friends would have...

38:13.833 --> 38:15.960
any idea how to describe me.

38:19.505 --> 38:23.217
When they... when they look at me,
they only see what I want them to see.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.512
Just like you're only seeing
what I want you to see,

38:27.096 --> 38:30.308
which, frankly, isn't the real me at all.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.768
Then who are you?

38:39.066 --> 38:40.151
[sadly] I don't know.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.951
You think Tyler's making a buy
and they're going to take him down?

38:49.035 --> 38:51.871
They set him a trap. Tomorrow night.

38:51.954 --> 38:55.416
And we've gotta stop him somehow,
but I can't get ahold of him,

38:55.499 --> 38:57.501
and he's nowhere to be found, so...

38:57.585 --> 39:01.922
I'm not in any shape
to help anyone right now.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.591
[Tony] What does that mean?

39:04.216 --> 39:05.676
Clay, what does that mean?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.179
I don't...
I don't understand what's happening.

39:08.262 --> 39:11.349
I'm, like... I'm grounded forever. I...

39:13.517 --> 39:15.895
Clay, this is everything.
This is everything!

39:15.978 --> 39:17.772
If they take him down, we're done.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.106
It's over.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.108
I feel like it's over already.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.861
What's going on?

39:25.571 --> 39:26.405
This isn't you.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.115
No, I...

39:30.993 --> 39:31.952
I know.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.704
[tense music plays]

39:49.929 --> 39:51.639
[door opens, slams closed]

39:53.557 --> 39:54.683
Sorry, my...

39:56.977 --> 39:58.521
my circumstances?

39:58.604 --> 40:00.439
Your essay indicated

40:00.523 --> 40:04.068
that you've faced down
a number of personal challenges.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.361
Talk to me about that.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.866
I was addicted to heroin.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.159
Mm.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.577
[Justin] And...

40:15.663 --> 40:17.665
I had sex with men for money.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.167
[chuckles awkwardly] Uh...

40:20.876 --> 40:23.546
Your mother has also struggled
with addiction?

40:26.924 --> 40:27.925
She, um...

40:33.013 --> 40:34.265
Yeah, she has.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.645
You have shown such fortitude.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.730
That will serve you well in college.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.774
Or did I just get really lucky?

40:47.361 --> 40:49.113
That I got out?  [exhales heavily]

40:50.197 --> 40:51.323
She never did.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.454
No one ever gave her a fucking chance.
[chuckles sadly]

40:58.706 --> 41:00.791
Maybe "fortitude..."

41:02.501 --> 41:05.296
has fuck-all to do with it, and...
[clicks tongue]

41:05.921 --> 41:09.300
...it really is all about circumstances.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.803
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

41:13.262 --> 41:16.015
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.520
We are all just so inspired by you.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.990
[Alex] How did you find me?

41:33.782 --> 41:34.783
[Charlie] Your mom.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.204
Don't worry,
I told her it was about homework.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.123
Not the fact that you like boys,

41:41.207 --> 41:44.710
at least sometimes,
and you're also breaking my heart.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.587
I'm not breaking your heart.

41:47.630 --> 41:48.714
You definitely are.

41:49.757 --> 41:50.674
Why?

41:52.384 --> 41:54.553
Why would you like someone like me?

41:55.179 --> 41:58.641
See, there you go
doing that self-depreciating thing.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.017
It's "deprecating."

42:01.268 --> 42:04.772
You do... that self-deprecating thing

42:04.855 --> 42:06.440
where you think it's about you.

42:06.524 --> 42:10.152
But what you're saying is
I'm dumb for liking you.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.613
You're, like, questioning my taste.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.074
And the thing is, I have excellent taste.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.909
You're very confident.

42:17.451 --> 42:18.536
I am very confident.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.996
You know,
most people find that attractive.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.249
I'm suspicious of confident people.

42:26.043 --> 42:26.919
OK.

42:30.130 --> 42:30.965
OK.

42:31.674 --> 42:36.136
Well, I'm confident enough
to be OK with that.

42:37.596 --> 42:40.599
Well, I'm not confident, OK?
I never have been.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.017
And I have a brain injury,

42:42.101 --> 42:46.146
and I've done these terrible things
that I'm never gonna get away from.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.898
I'm not a good person.

42:49.191 --> 42:52.528
And you have this, like,
king-of-the-world jock thing,

42:52.611 --> 42:55.864
so I'm never gonna win an argument
about why we shouldn't be together.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.117
You're gonna have to just
take my word for it.

42:59.868 --> 43:00.869
[sighs]

43:01.996 --> 43:03.330
I'm gonna walk away now.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.707
Please don't follow me.

43:07.668 --> 43:10.254
Your essay about robotics...
[chuckles]

43:10.963 --> 43:12.923
...is a beautiful use of metaphor.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.593
What do you like most about robots?

43:15.884 --> 43:16.844
Um...

43:18.554 --> 43:20.514
[clicks tongue] Uh... making them,

43:21.181 --> 43:22.182
the robots.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.310
[recruiter] OK.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.855
Been a good student
throughout your entire career.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.231
What's your secret?

43:29.315 --> 43:31.567
I don't... I don't have a secret.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.820
I'm... I was just... I'm just smart.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.365
I know your grades dropped a bit
the last semester.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.577
You explained your extraordinary
circumstances in your application.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.746
What did that whole experience teach you?

43:44.830 --> 43:47.082
-I don't like enclosed spaces.
-Ah.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.335
I see.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.176
-What's most important to you, Clay?
-My friends.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.141
[clears throat]

44:05.267 --> 44:06.518
[stuttering] I've, uh...

44:07.102 --> 44:10.230
I've made a lot of mistakes,
some bad choices,

44:10.689 --> 44:14.360
and I don't always...
I don't always think things through.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.990
But I know that if a friend needs me,
or is in danger, or anything,

44:20.908 --> 44:24.411
if there is anything I can do
to help them, I will.

44:28.916 --> 44:29.792
Uh...

44:31.752 --> 44:33.087
I'm really...

44:34.338 --> 44:36.965
really trying to do the right thing.

44:40.594 --> 44:41.512
I am.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.642
Even when it's not clear what that is.

44:48.936 --> 44:52.523
'Cause I don't want to live my life
based on someone else's idea of...

44:53.190 --> 44:55.693
what's right,
or what's moral, or what's good.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.653
I want to figure it out for myself.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.572
Even if I make mistakes along the way.

45:04.868 --> 45:07.162
And the one thing I know...

45:09.164 --> 45:12.209
is it is never wrong
to care about your friends.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.673
It's never wrong

45:18.590 --> 45:20.134
to be a human being

45:20.759 --> 45:23.220
and love someone as well as you can.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.596
And...

45:28.350 --> 45:29.268
Uh...

45:30.477 --> 45:31.478
Uh, yeah.

45:38.026 --> 45:41.405
Uh, I don't... I don't want Clay to know.

45:42.906 --> 45:43.824
Um...

45:43.907 --> 45:46.410
He needs to get better, and, um...

45:46.994 --> 45:48.203
[inhales sharply]

45:49.288 --> 45:52.458
I don't really want
to be in the way of that.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.460
You could never.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.090
[Lainie]
What would you like to do for a service?

46:03.177 --> 46:04.178
A service?

46:04.970 --> 46:06.096
Yeah, a funeral.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.389
A memorial?

46:10.184 --> 46:11.185
I don't...

46:11.894 --> 46:13.270
I don't want a service.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.233
She didn't have any family or friends,
so...

46:18.776 --> 46:19.735
She had you.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.780
She didn't, really.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.491
Maybe we take a day... [sniffles]

46:25.574 --> 46:26.575
...as a family.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.244
We could scatter her ashes in the river.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.455
[yells] I don't fucking want anything! OK?

46:33.582 --> 46:34.750
[laughs sadly]

46:35.876 --> 46:37.961
I don't need some bullshit service

46:38.045 --> 46:41.465
so that you all can feel better
about some broke junkie being dead!

46:41.548 --> 46:42.466
Jesus!

46:42.800 --> 46:43.717
Fuck!

46:51.141 --> 46:52.017
Sorry.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.563
Uh, I just...
I've been to enough funerals in my life.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.732
-[Matt] Of course.
-[Lainie] Justin, love.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.611
What can we do?

47:03.821 --> 47:05.823
[mournful instrumental music plays]

47:07.741 --> 47:08.742
I'm good.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.287
Really. Really. Thank you.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.749
[door opens, closes]

47:17.626 --> 47:19.962
[mournful instrumental music continues]

48:28.572 --> 48:29.865
[sobs]

48:54.139 --> 48:56.558
I mean, the flowers were beautiful.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.559
Yeah.

48:58.894 --> 49:03.357
-It was so kind of you to think of us.
-Oh, you both were so kind to me.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.317
How's your mother doing now?

49:05.400 --> 49:07.486
Yeah, she's much better.

49:09.237 --> 49:12.074
-And how are you holding up?
-Yeah, just fine.

49:12.658 --> 49:13.492
Yeah.

49:13.951 --> 49:14.868
Thank you.

49:18.205 --> 49:19.790
[Nora] Oh, honey.

49:19.873 --> 49:21.583
[sobs] Sorry.

49:22.918 --> 49:24.086
No, no,

49:24.586 --> 49:25.754
don't be sorry.

49:27.214 --> 49:30.717
I've been trying to be the thing
that I thought people needed me to be.

49:31.885 --> 49:32.844
But I...

49:34.554 --> 49:36.390
I don't know if I know what that is.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.309
All I know is that I've failed.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.812
No! No, you haven't.

49:42.604 --> 49:45.315
[sighs] You've done beautifully well.

49:46.608 --> 49:49.987
And you need to remember
you're still a teenager.

49:50.612 --> 49:53.907
You're still figuring out who you are.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.951
But you haven't failed anyone.

49:57.285 --> 49:58.829
You know, Ani, I, uh...

50:00.330 --> 50:02.249
I always imagined I'd be...

50:03.041 --> 50:07.462
getting Bryce ready
to go off to college right about now.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.340
His father and I, um...

50:11.008 --> 50:13.385
put away some money
for his college fund.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.888
And now, well... [sighs sadly]

50:18.348 --> 50:22.769
...as you get ready to go off
to Yale or Stanford

50:22.853 --> 50:24.563
or wherever you choose,

50:29.192 --> 50:31.778
I wonder if you could help me
put it to good use.

50:36.658 --> 50:38.035
Mrs. Walker, uh...

50:38.577 --> 50:39.661
I... I couldn't...

50:39.745 --> 50:41.288
I couldn't take Bryce's money.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.500
Besides, I don't even know
if I'm getting into college after today.

50:46.668 --> 50:49.838
Ani, they'd be out of their minds
not to accept you.

50:58.972 --> 51:02.017
And I think you saw something in my son
that I...

51:02.893 --> 51:04.394
even I couldn't always see.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.523
I just tried to be there for him...

51:09.316 --> 51:10.734
when he needed a friend.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.570
And now I'd like to do the same for you.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.490
You deserve

51:17.282 --> 51:21.286
to be able to build the kind of future
you want for yourself,

51:22.287 --> 51:23.663
whatever that may be.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.171
[tapping phone keys]

51:34.049 --> 51:35.759
[indistinct muttering]

51:39.679 --> 51:41.598
You've made the right choice, Dempsey.

51:43.183 --> 51:45.685
I mean, that is why we're here, right?

51:47.562 --> 51:48.563
Oh, yeah.

51:49.773 --> 51:52.943
I'm here to cleanse my soul.

51:54.444 --> 51:55.278
[Diego] Good.

51:56.488 --> 51:57.531
Then let's hear it.

52:06.331 --> 52:07.332
Come on.

52:07.415 --> 52:08.667
I'm not gonna bite you.

52:08.750 --> 52:09.668
OK.

52:10.710 --> 52:11.878
[Zach sighs heavily]

52:17.551 --> 52:18.426
Fuck...

52:18.885 --> 52:19.761
you.

52:21.054 --> 52:22.180
[snickers]

52:24.349 --> 52:27.102
Seriously?
You hauled us out here to be a tough guy?

52:27.185 --> 52:28.562
Oh, yeah. Yes, I did.

52:29.354 --> 52:32.315
I invited all of you out here
so that I could tell you all,

52:32.983 --> 52:34.067
in person,

52:34.734 --> 52:37.237
with all of my best wishes,

52:37.320 --> 52:41.199
to suck my giant dick.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.660
[chuckles]

52:46.121 --> 52:48.081
Aw! [chuckles]

52:49.166 --> 52:51.084
-[Zach groans]
-Jesus, Diego!

52:51.168 --> 52:52.252
How about that, huh?

52:52.335 --> 52:54.296
-That help your memory?
-You know what? Yeah.

52:54.379 --> 52:55.714
No, that helped. Thank you.

52:55.797 --> 52:58.258
I think...
I think I remembered something. [sniffs]

53:00.093 --> 53:02.679
I remember that you're a fucking pussy.
[chuckles]

53:03.138 --> 53:04.055
Motherfucker.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.557
-[grunting]
-[groaning]

53:09.686 --> 53:11.938
[Zach] It's... OK, OK, OK! All right.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.232
[groans, breathes heavily]

53:15.317 --> 53:16.735
I'll tell you who did it.

53:19.446 --> 53:20.697
It was me.

53:23.283 --> 53:24.117
[spits]

53:24.618 --> 53:25.911
It was me all along!

53:25.994 --> 53:27.454
[laughs] Woohoo--

53:27.537 --> 53:29.956
[laughs hysterically, groans]

53:35.545 --> 53:36.463
Harder.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.256
Pussy!

53:39.507 --> 53:40.675
[shouts] Hit me harder!

53:45.972 --> 53:47.390
[Luke] Jesus, Diego, enough!

53:50.101 --> 53:51.269
[growls]

53:51.353 --> 53:52.771
[groans, pants]

53:54.564 --> 53:57.025
-[Luke] Let's get outta here.
-You're fucking crazy, you know?

53:57.442 --> 54:00.904
You belong in a mental hospital
next to your boy Jensen, you sick fuck!

54:01.112 --> 54:03.198
[breathes heavily]

54:03.281 --> 54:04.866
[Zach] Aw, come on!

54:04.950 --> 54:06.910
[sniffs] Let's fucking go.

54:07.535 --> 54:09.663
[breathes heavily, groans]

54:09.746 --> 54:10.789
Is that all you got?

54:11.665 --> 54:13.208
[footsteps receding]

54:15.669 --> 54:17.003
[tense music plays]

54:20.924 --> 54:21.967
[sighs]

54:23.301 --> 54:25.011
What the fuck?

54:26.513 --> 54:27.472
Hey.

54:29.057 --> 54:29.975
You came.

54:31.184 --> 54:33.228
Of course, you needed me.
Why wouldn't I?

54:33.770 --> 54:35.397
-I...
-[chuckles]

54:35.480 --> 54:37.190
Hey, how long have you been here?

54:38.608 --> 54:39.609
About two hours.

54:40.068 --> 54:43.738
No Tyler, no cops,
so maybe they called the whole thing off.

54:46.241 --> 54:47.117
Wait.

54:48.576 --> 54:49.577
There.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.216
Go. Let's go.

55:10.598 --> 55:12.017
[Clay] Hey, Tyler, wait up!

55:13.643 --> 55:15.520
-What are you doing?
-You gotta come with us!

55:15.603 --> 55:16.438
What the fuck?

55:16.521 --> 55:18.523
Whatever you guys are doing,
you need to stop!

55:18.606 --> 55:20.525
-Who the fuck are these clowns?
-No one.

55:20.608 --> 55:22.152
Just get the fuck out of here!

55:22.235 --> 55:24.738
-You gotta come with us. Tyler!
-Fuck this, I'm out.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.573
-[sirens approaching]
-Shit!

55:26.656 --> 55:27.782
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.202
-Shit!
-Police! Stay where you are!

55:31.286 --> 55:32.871
Lower the gun!

55:32.954 --> 55:34.664
-Lower the gun, right now!
-Shut the fuck up.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.624
-Put it down now!
-Put the gun down!

55:36.708 --> 55:37.959
-Put down your weapon!
-Fuck off!

55:38.043 --> 55:39.169
[gunshot]

55:42.213 --> 55:43.840
[ominous music plays]

55:53.850 --> 55:57.771
[Tyler reads text]

57:52.343 --> 57:54.304
[man] Well done, Ed. Well done.
