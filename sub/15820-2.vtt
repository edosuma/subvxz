00:14.008 --> 00:16.132
Mulholland drive.

00:18.093 --> 00:20.519
Mulholland circle.

01:45.628 --> 01:48.333
What the hell is goin' on here?

01:48.736 --> 01:50.183
Oh, my god.

01:51.349 --> 01:53.374
Sweet Mary.

02:07.597 --> 02:08.414
Mornin'.

02:08.683 --> 02:13.020
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh
Johnson, priority murder squad.

02:14.441 --> 02:16.109
Sorry to keep you waitin'.

02:16.149 --> 02:17.009
I, uh…

02:17.766 --> 02:19.152
had a little trouble.

02:20.909 --> 02:21.666
Mornin'.

02:22.258 --> 02:23.351
Morning'. Um…

02:25.094 --> 02:26.927
if this is a natural
death, why are we even here?

02:26.967 --> 02:28.573
Covering our asses, that's what.

02:28.613 --> 02:31.261
Baby-sitting dead celebrities,
my favorite part of the job.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.521
She just slipped in the shower?

02:32.561 --> 02:33.419
Good morning.

02:33.518 --> 02:34.917
That sounds kinda lame to me.

02:34.957 --> 02:36.797
Well, she was a model, not a gymnast.

02:36.837 --> 02:37.991
She was a little top-heavy, too.

02:38.031 --> 02:39.897
That is not funny, sergeant.

02:40.382 --> 02:41.349
Yes, ma'am.

02:44.196 --> 02:46.538
I should have interviewed
the person who found the body.

02:46.578 --> 02:47.767
Well, you weren't here,

02:47.807 --> 02:50.586
and we got to thinkin'
maybe you weren't coming.

02:50.626 --> 02:52.459
Ohh, I can't find my glasses.

02:52.499 --> 02:55.238
Ok, well, you know what?
I'll just tell you then, ok?

02:55.278 --> 02:58.840
Now, the hairdresser arrived around 8
a.m. to give Heather a cut and a blow-dry.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.473
How did she get in, the hairdresser?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.639
Well, she and the manicurist
both have codes to the front gate,

03:02.679 --> 03:04.189
and the door was left unlocked.

03:04.229 --> 03:06.205
Uh-huh. There's no maids or anything?

03:06.245 --> 03:07.961
Everybody's off on Monday.

03:12.054 --> 03:13.727
Where's her movie star husband?

03:13.767 --> 03:17.006
We're tryin' to find him. Could
we wrap this up before I retire?

03:17.046 --> 03:20.940
Of course, lieutenant. Thank
you so much for your patience.

03:20.947 --> 03:23.670
She just happens to drop
dead when no one's around?

03:23.710 --> 03:24.964
That's interesting.

03:27.055 --> 03:28.574
Heather Kingsley,

03:29.217 --> 03:30.174
cover girl.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.927
She usually looks a
lot better than this.

03:32.967 --> 03:37.523
Now, according to E. MT., she died
between 7:50 a. m. and 8:30 this morning,

03:37.563 --> 03:40.965
but she goes out clean. She showers,
she shampoos her hair, rinses,

03:41.005 --> 03:43.457
then she puts in this leave-in
conditioner here, you see?

03:43.497 --> 03:46.405
Now, that has to stay on for 20
minutes and I believe she was…

03:46.445 --> 03:49.730
While she's waitin' to rinse it
off, she shaves her legs, see?

03:49.770 --> 03:51.882
That's a fresh nick on her knee.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.233
Oh, yeah. Ok.

03:58.317 --> 04:02.620
Uh… and you see here, up around the
scalp, you see how it's all red and stuff?

04:02.660 --> 04:05.420
Well, the E. MT. s say that could be
an allergic reaction to something.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.945
She could have fallen, hit her
head, developed anaphylactic shock.

04:10.034 --> 04:14.918
Meanwhile, Jennifer the hairdresser arrives,
and she waits, but, uh, Heather doesn't come—

04:14.958 --> 04:18.279
Heather doesn't come
downstairs, which she says is odd

04:18.319 --> 04:20.414
because Heather told her
she was in a hurry today

04:20.454 --> 04:23.621
and had lots of appointments
so she goes hunting for her,

04:23.661 --> 04:26.991
and finds her lying here in
the shower and can't, um…

04:27.031 --> 04:29.003
Are you looking for something, chief?

04:29.043 --> 04:33.354
I am lookin' for something, because Heather
shaved her legs before droppin' dead,

04:33.394 --> 04:36.573
and there is no razor
anywhere of any kind.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.018
Is that important?

04:39.532 --> 04:41.351
Only if we can't find it.

04:43.485 --> 04:45.002
She's all yours.

04:52.266 --> 04:53.304
Mornin'.

05:03.889 --> 05:05.010
–Chief?
–Yes?

05:06.420 --> 05:07.162
Ok.

05:08.284 --> 05:11.069
Deputy chief Johnson, this is
Heather's P. A., Lindsey Hagan.

05:11.109 --> 05:12.796
Sorry to keep you waitin', miss Hagan,

05:12.836 --> 05:15.815
and I understand this is very
upsetting, so I'll try to be brief.

05:15.855 --> 05:17.690
We're havin' trouble
locatin' Mr Kingsley.

05:17.730 --> 05:19.664
Do you have any idea where he is?

05:19.704 --> 05:21.760
He has a boat in the marina.

05:22.129 --> 05:23.052
Dean…

05:23.580 --> 05:26.765
Mr Kingsley, I mean, he goes
there a lot when he's not shooting.

05:26.805 --> 05:28.951
We've tried callin' him,
but there's no answer.

05:28.991 --> 05:30.636
Uh, could he be out there alone?

05:30.676 --> 05:31.732
There's no crew.

05:31.747 --> 05:34.057
If his cell phone isn't turned off…

05:35.453 --> 05:36.310
I'm sorry.

05:37.698 --> 05:39.049
Where are they taking Heather?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.160
Um, we have to do an autopsy.

05:41.344 --> 05:44.360
I understand that Mrs
Kingsley was in a hurry today,

05:44.400 --> 05:45.805
that she had a lot to do.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.946
Was this business?

05:46.986 --> 05:51.016
No. No, she hasn't worked in 2 years.

05:51.112 --> 05:52.004
Hurry?

05:52.255 --> 05:53.920
She was just getting her hair done,

05:53.960 --> 05:55.902
picking up a dress from Jeanine…

05:55.942 --> 05:57.606
That's her personal shopper…

05:57.646 --> 05:59.588
and having her face made up.

05:59.674 --> 06:01.588
Is that her appointment book?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.104
May I take it with me?

06:03.167 --> 06:06.076
You can come by the office tomorrow
and maybe help me decipher it.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.332
Sometimes I have questions.

06:07.372 --> 06:08.826
Ok… uh…

06:10.361 --> 06:11.217
sure.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.782
Guess we won't be needing it anymore.

06:14.914 --> 06:16.313
Thank you so much.

06:16.692 --> 06:18.012
Sorry for your loss.

06:23.829 --> 06:26.816
So, uh, we don't find a razor, and
you're gonna treat this as a murder?

06:26.856 --> 06:27.829
Yes, I am.

06:27.937 --> 06:30.729
Send some officers down to
the marina. Find me the husband

06:30.769 --> 06:32.863
and join me at the morgue, please.

06:32.903 --> 06:36.995
Uh, you know, if you want to
wait a minute, I could drive you.

06:37.226 --> 06:39.338
Why would I need you to do that?

06:45.660 --> 06:47.361
How much longer is she gonna be?

06:47.401 --> 06:49.639
She should be any minute.
She left before I did.

06:49.679 --> 06:51.857
Oh— I mean— Can
we start? I mean—

06:51.886 --> 06:53.842
You do not want to do that. Bad idea.

06:53.882 --> 06:56.066
Sorry. Sorry. I just…

06:56.786 --> 06:57.766
I had a delay.

07:00.607 --> 07:01.565
Can we start?

07:06.051 --> 07:06.802
Thank you.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.042
Excuse me.

07:12.430 --> 07:13.194
Sorry.

07:13.748 --> 07:19.160
There's no subdermal hematoma on the bump
on her head so the fall didn't kill her.

07:20.613 --> 07:21.633
Miss…

07:21.668 --> 07:22.432
Sorry.

07:23.595 --> 07:28.608
No gastrointestinal distress…
no perforation of the intestines.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.477
It could be a heart attack.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.794
Well, let me get this lung out of here.

07:34.675 --> 07:36.933
Oh… Hold on…

07:42.560 --> 07:44.692
What color would you say this was?

07:44.732 --> 07:47.508
Uh… let's see.

07:47.674 --> 07:48.772
It's pink…

07:49.102 --> 07:51.555
A little purple around the
edges… that's not right, is it?

07:51.595 --> 07:54.169
Hmm, no, her respiratory muscle seized.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.915
31 ounces.

07:56.993 --> 07:57.949
Could that be poison?

07:57.989 --> 07:59.947
There's no causative
damage inside the mouth.

07:59.987 --> 08:01.602
How would the poison
have been introduced?

08:01.642 --> 08:04.323
Absorbed through her skin.
She has a rash on her scalp.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.850
She had on leave-in
conditioner before she died.

08:06.890 --> 08:10.805
Yeah? Well, then, I suggest we get a sample
of her blood and urine over to toxicology.

08:10.845 --> 08:11.786
How long will that take?

08:11.826 --> 08:13.383
Well, I could put a rush on it.

08:13.423 --> 08:16.987
We should get it back by
what the first of next month.

08:21.562 --> 08:23.303
Right. Right.

08:23.389 --> 08:25.237
Right. Well, let me ask her.

08:25.376 --> 08:26.273
Brenda?

08:27.172 --> 08:28.034
Brenda?

08:28.443 --> 08:31.192
Hey, my-my guy at quantico
says he needs a photograph

08:31.232 --> 08:33.729
of the postmortem
lividity around the scalp.

08:33.769 --> 08:35.352
You have a camera handy?

08:38.154 --> 08:41.241
Hey, hey, don't, like get
anything nasty on that phone, ok?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.650
I just got that phone
a couple weeks ago.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.875
Ok, I got that. Now what?

08:48.331 --> 08:49.829
Uh, excuse me, Dr Crippen,

08:49.869 --> 08:52.778
could the poison have shut
down her central nervous system?

08:52.818 --> 08:55.911
I was gonna suggest that before
you called your F. B. I. friend.

08:55.951 --> 08:58.938
In fact, if you let me shave her head,

08:59.027 --> 09:00.760
I could pop open her skull

09:00.991 --> 09:02.286
and look inside.

09:02.512 --> 09:05.284
Well, she was plannin'
on a haircut today.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.435
Uh, this is gonna take a few seconds.

09:08.497 --> 09:11.371
I'll call you right back
when I've sent the pictures.

09:11.411 --> 09:12.514
Ok.

09:20.188 --> 09:23.083
And what time did you take
your boat out, Mr Kingsley?

09:23.123 --> 09:24.049
Around noon.

09:25.421 --> 09:27.067
And did you stay out all night?

09:27.107 --> 09:28.905
Yeah, I was watching

09:29.889 --> 09:31.378
the moon on the water.

09:31.624 --> 09:33.531
It's quite solitary and beautiful.

09:33.571 --> 09:35.281
And were you by yourself?

09:36.304 --> 09:37.141
Yep.

09:37.307 --> 09:38.621
How long has he been in there?

09:38.661 --> 09:39.644
About 20 minutes.

09:39.684 --> 09:40.837
And no one called me⁈

09:40.877 --> 09:44.243
I was going to, but chief
Pope told us not to wait.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.754
That's a nice boat you got there.

09:48.794 --> 09:50.840
What are you doing? What? What?

09:50.896 --> 09:54.826
Look, you've only been here a
couple of weeks, so trust me.

09:54.919 --> 09:56.836
If we determine that Heather
Kingsley was murdered,

09:56.876 --> 09:59.912
this investigation turns
into a 24/7 cablefest

09:59.942 --> 10:02.799
with an international media
horde dogging our heels.

10:02.839 --> 10:06.584
Now, even you cannot be everywhere
at once. You have to delegate.

10:06.624 --> 10:07.945
Do you understand what I'm saying?

10:07.985 --> 10:09.091
Yes, Will, I do.

10:09.154 --> 10:12.443
You're saying you're so nervous about this
case, you want to supervise it yourself.

10:12.483 --> 10:13.671
No, wait a minute.

10:13.783 --> 10:16.515
Oh, Mr Kingsley, pardon
me for interrupting.

10:16.555 --> 10:19.063
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

10:19.098 --> 10:21.829
Detective Sanchez, if you
could please move over.

10:21.869 --> 10:22.868
Thank you.

10:23.364 --> 10:26.004
Well, that's perfect. Thank you so much.

10:28.163 --> 10:33.724
On behalf of the LAPD, I'd like to express how
awful we all feel about this terrible tragedy.

10:33.764 --> 10:34.754
And you are…

10:35.054 --> 10:37.496
Joe Melnick. I represent Mr Kingsley,

10:37.692 --> 10:38.946
and I'm his friend.

10:39.227 --> 10:40.201
Can I see her?

10:40.919 --> 10:41.902
My wife?

10:42.613 --> 10:44.969
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Kingsley.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.529
We tried to locate
you before the autopsy,

10:47.569 --> 10:50.125
but right now, your wife, she's just…

10:51.139 --> 10:53.115
not how you remember her.

10:53.567 --> 10:56.756
Now, I have a few questions
that I have to ask,

10:56.848 --> 11:00.629
and then we'll let you
go somewhere in private

11:00.729 --> 11:02.184
so you can grieve.

11:02.532 --> 11:04.873
Mrs Kingsley was gettin' ready
to meet someone this afternoon.

11:04.913 --> 11:06.948
Were you aware of that? Do
you know where she was going?

11:06.988 --> 11:07.817
No.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.492
Look, I don't have any information
that can help you, all right?

11:10.532 --> 11:12.478
Do I have to answer these
questions right now? I mean, please.

11:12.518 --> 11:13.904
Excuse me, uh, chief…

11:15.908 --> 11:17.654
Well, you can tell her to wait outside.

11:17.694 --> 11:19.542
No, I will not wait outside.

11:19.774 --> 11:21.050
I'm Mr Kingsley's attorney,

11:21.090 --> 11:22.769
and you're questioning
my client without—

11:22.809 --> 11:25.474
The constitution
entitles you to a lawyer,

11:25.514 --> 11:26.908
Mr Kingsley, not a firm.

11:26.948 --> 11:27.677
Uh, excuse me.

11:27.717 --> 11:29.146
I think there's some confusion here.

11:29.186 --> 11:30.399
I'm not a lawyer.

11:31.143 --> 11:33.303
You just said you
represented Mr Kingsley.

11:33.343 --> 11:34.287
I do…

11:34.440 --> 11:35.488
for features.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.883
I chose my agent.

11:36.976 --> 11:38.942
Ok, that's enough. Dean,
you're coming with me.

11:38.982 --> 11:40.236
We're through here.

11:41.097 --> 11:42.813
Are you gonna pretend
that you didn't know

11:42.853 --> 11:45.287
that you were questioning my client
without his counsel being present?

11:45.327 --> 11:48.379
Maybe you can explain to me why an
innocent man needs an attorney to explain

11:48.419 --> 11:49.891
the accidental death of his wife.

11:49.931 --> 11:50.838
That's an accusation?

11:50.878 --> 11:52.799
Dean, not another word!

11:52.905 --> 11:54.357
Are you arresting him?

11:54.985 --> 11:55.907
No.

11:55.942 --> 11:57.169
Then he's through here.

11:57.209 --> 12:03.781
If you want to see him again, I
suggest you buy a box set of his DVDs.

12:12.471 --> 12:14.458
I was promised a crew
of elite detectives,

12:14.498 --> 12:16.271
and what captain
Taylor here has given me

12:16.311 --> 12:19.262
is a bunch of junior varsity
wannabes and Provenza.

12:19.302 --> 12:20.577
That's not exactly right.

12:20.617 --> 12:22.832
Lieutenant Tao's a technical genius.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.470
I pulled Sanchez out of
the gang intelligence unit,

12:25.510 --> 12:26.896
and sergeant Gabriel,

12:26.904 --> 12:30.301
he has a master's degree in
public administration from USC.

12:30.341 --> 12:31.702
Which makes him a great bureaucrat.

12:31.742 --> 12:35.565
Look, last night, I found myself
sittin' opposite my chief suspect,

12:35.605 --> 12:38.582
tradin' questions with
an agent from C. A. A.

12:38.813 --> 12:40.922
Well, he looked like an attorney.

12:40.962 --> 12:43.061
–The desk officer—
–Should be reassigned.

12:43.101 --> 12:46.552
Look, if you want this priority murder
squad to function properly, you need to—

12:46.592 --> 12:48.650
It's all right. It's all right,
chief. She has a good point.

12:48.690 --> 12:49.786
I'll tell you what.

12:49.826 --> 12:52.095
Robbery-homicide will
share resources with you.

12:52.135 --> 12:54.291
I'll loan you one of our best guys.

12:54.331 --> 12:56.035
Well, thank you, captain Taylor.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.531
That's unbelievably helpful of you.

12:58.631 --> 12:59.531
No problem.

12:59.636 --> 13:01.552
We're all playin' on
the same team, right?

13:01.592 --> 13:04.106
And, uh, if there's anything
else I can do for you, ma'am,

13:04.146 --> 13:05.886
you just let me know.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.651
Now, let me be very
clear on this, Brenda.

13:11.924 --> 13:15.335
I do not want to hear any more
complaints about your squad.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.955
If you have a problem with their work,

13:18.065 --> 13:20.640
then it is your
responsibility to improve it,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.740
and when, when,

13:23.029 --> 13:26.264
when am I going to be
able to say definitively

13:26.327 --> 13:27.910
that Heather Kingsley was poisoned?

13:27.950 --> 13:30.288
Not my fault, unless I can
figure out what I'm lookin' for.

13:30.328 --> 13:34.099
The fastest toxicology can
get back to me is next month.

13:34.818 --> 13:38.189
Well, what if Dean Kingsley can prove
he was on his boat when his wife died?

13:38.229 --> 13:39.456
It's not an alibi.

13:39.559 --> 13:41.934
If the conditioner really is
the vehicle for the poison,

13:41.974 --> 13:44.418
then it could have been slipped
into the bottle weeks ago.

13:44.458 --> 13:48.331
Look, I-I have another issue
that I have to discuss with you.

13:48.371 --> 13:52.610
Um, the priority murder squad
got its stationary yesterday,

13:52.715 --> 13:55.421
and I just got a look
at it this morning.

14:02.852 --> 14:04.280
Ok, so this is…

14:04.317 --> 14:07.502
Dr Durmont was collagen
injections and dermabrasion.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.642
Ok.

14:08.961 --> 14:12.485
More tips about Dean
Kingsley's personal life.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.694
Oh, thank you so much,
detective Daniels.

14:14.734 --> 14:17.572
I'm sorry, Lindsey.
Go on. You were saying?

14:17.730 --> 14:20.596
Oh, that one was to
have her hair colored.

14:20.719 --> 14:22.592
What do you want me to do
about these interview requests?

14:22.632 --> 14:25.607
We got CNN, Court TV, all the
networks and Access Hollywood.

14:25.647 --> 14:29.490
Tell them all no and not to
play in my part of the sandbox.

14:29.530 --> 14:34.385
Journalists. This is like a holiday for
them, huntin' gossip, destroyin' lives.

14:34.425 --> 14:35.972
Oh, well, what can you do?

14:36.012 --> 14:37.604
Ok, I'm sorry, Lindsey,

14:37.676 --> 14:40.009
so you were saying about the hair dye?

14:40.049 --> 14:43.157
Yes, she does that 3 days
before she has it cut.

14:43.197 --> 14:45.812
Ok, 1,2,3.

14:45.951 --> 14:48.580
Hair dye…

14:50.598 --> 14:55.680
Look, if this is going to turn into an
investigation of Dean's personal life…

15:00.298 --> 15:02.288
Is there somewhere private
where we could talk?

15:02.328 --> 15:03.935
Absolutely, absolutely.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.153
6 years ago, I was an associate producer

15:10.193 --> 15:11.975
on a movie Dean starred in.

15:13.743 --> 15:15.393
One thing led to another,

15:15.684 --> 15:19.314
I ended up spending a lot
of time with him on his boat.

15:19.744 --> 15:23.420
Heather's afraid of the
water, so the boat's ideal.

15:25.567 --> 15:28.339
Are you saying you
had an affair with him?

15:30.266 --> 15:31.183
Yeah…

15:31.895 --> 15:33.149
that's what it was.

15:34.522 --> 15:37.982
I mean, he said that he loved me,

15:38.095 --> 15:41.435
that his marriage was over, and
he was gonna leave Heather for me,

15:41.475 --> 15:43.805
and after I believed all his bullshit,

15:43.845 --> 15:47.222
he suddenly remembered he
had this terrible prenup,

15:47.439 --> 15:51.360
and his agent told him that the
publicity from the divorce…

15:56.756 --> 16:00.223
Yes, it was an affair.

16:01.870 --> 16:04.312
How'd you start workin' for his wife?

16:04.448 --> 16:07.266
Studios overlook the
behavior of their stars,

16:07.306 --> 16:09.671
not their lowly executives,

16:09.764 --> 16:14.087
and after Dean dumped me, I couldn't even
get a job running errands on a music video.

16:14.127 --> 16:17.229
Heather needed someone.
Dean felt sorry for me.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.886
It's awful…

16:20.318 --> 16:22.208
Pathetic, I know.

16:22.862 --> 16:26.184
Look, if there's just some way

16:26.261 --> 16:28.793
that you could keep
this out of the media…

16:28.833 --> 16:30.963
I don't want it to ruin my life again.

16:31.003 --> 16:33.165
I was hardly Dean's last girlfriend.

16:33.205 --> 16:35.515
That sailboat is more like a ferry.

16:36.781 --> 16:40.568
What do you suppose Heather would have
done if she figured out what Dean was up to?

16:40.608 --> 16:45.042
Um… I hope she would have taken
him for everything he was worth.

16:49.113 --> 16:51.598
Sergeant Gabriel, if you
could call the switchboard

16:51.638 --> 16:54.273
and have them redirect all
these calls back to the tip line.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.931
I got what I needed, thank you.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.109
Ok, let's divide up.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.887
Sanchez and Daniels, if you
could go to the marina, please,

16:59.927 --> 17:03.032
find me somebody who saw
Dean Kingsley on his sailboat.

17:03.072 --> 17:05.886
Lieutenant Tao, I hear we have
a savage prenup in the mix.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.708
I'd like to know its terms.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.807
Lieutenant Provenza,

17:13.874 --> 17:16.382
if you could look through
Mr Kingsley's movies,

17:16.422 --> 17:20.513
see if there's anything that
might parallel his wife's murder.

17:21.002 --> 17:22.747
Hiya, chief. Remember me?

17:22.858 --> 17:24.993
Of course I do. Lieutenant Flynn.

17:25.034 --> 17:26.288
How can I help you?

17:26.371 --> 17:27.856
Other way around, ma'am.

17:27.896 --> 17:30.734
Captain Taylor sent
me over to lend a hand.

17:31.130 --> 17:31.989
Right.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.252
Well, good.

17:34.482 --> 17:36.893
Maybe you could put a
new warrant together,

17:36.933 --> 17:39.919
supervise the search of
Kingsley's house and sailboat.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.984
I'm lookin' for anything that
might contain some form of poison.

17:43.024 --> 17:44.022
Anything, huh?

17:44.131 --> 17:45.175
You gotta be kidding.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.712
That could include cleaning supplies,

17:47.921 --> 17:50.081
detergents, medicines, aerosols…

17:50.153 --> 17:52.130
Well, it sounds like
you'll be real busy, then,

17:52.170 --> 17:54.678
so I won't hold you. Sergeant Gabriel?

18:01.433 --> 18:06.253
So, um, what are we gonna do if
Mr Kingsley won't talk to us?

18:08.101 --> 18:11.933
If you can't interview the suspect, you
find out what you can about the victim.

18:11.973 --> 18:17.165
Um, botox, collagen,
dermabrasion, haircut,

18:17.240 --> 18:20.474
new dress, a complete
makeover, and then nothing.

18:20.757 --> 18:24.319
I think we need to find out who Heather
was gettin' all gussied up to go see.

18:24.359 --> 18:26.023
So you want me to have some of
those people brought in or…

18:26.063 --> 18:29.316
No. Um, I think it's better
if we go to their workplace

18:29.356 --> 18:31.675
where they have no
expectation of privacy,

18:31.715 --> 18:33.827
keep them in their comfort zone.

18:38.213 --> 18:39.274
Look, uh…

18:40.647 --> 18:44.397
if you're finished with your
paperwork for today, sergeant Gabriel,

18:44.437 --> 18:46.443
it might be useful for you to…

18:46.704 --> 18:47.626
come with me…

18:47.946 --> 18:49.237
to observe…

18:49.355 --> 18:52.123
If-if you want.

18:52.228 --> 18:54.166
Yeah, ok, um,

18:55.261 --> 18:56.515
useful in what way?

18:56.643 --> 18:57.920
What can I do?

19:02.498 --> 19:04.137
…and I have to go to the funeral,

19:04.177 --> 19:06.167
so I figured that
since you found the body

19:06.207 --> 19:07.478
and Heather knew you,

19:07.518 --> 19:09.894
I could kill 2 birds with one stone.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.607
I
–if you're up to it.

19:11.623 --> 19:13.056
Yesterday was tough.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.408
I'm better today,

19:14.569 --> 19:15.732
and when Lindsey called,

19:15.772 --> 19:17.192
she said you really needed help,

19:17.232 --> 19:20.383
so how long have you
had your hair that way?

19:20.486 --> 19:22.635
About 3 years, oh, I don't know,

19:22.749 --> 19:24.683
you know, I like to
be pretty free with it.

19:24.723 --> 19:27.340
Mmm. Not so free it escapes.

19:27.549 --> 19:28.977
You are the police.

19:31.556 --> 19:34.545
I understand that Heather
was in a hurry yesterday.

19:34.585 --> 19:37.201
And I was wonderin' if
it was because she was—

19:37.241 --> 19:38.666
Oh, gosh, what was…

19:38.957 --> 19:41.927
Gabriel, do you remember
who she was meetin'?

19:42.483 --> 19:43.598
No, ma'am.

19:43.941 --> 19:45.279
Oh, I should have written it down.

19:45.319 --> 19:46.894
It's on the tip of my tongue.

19:46.934 --> 19:48.834
Well, whoever it was, she
called me the night before

19:48.874 --> 19:51.629
and was like, “be
here by 8:00, you know,

19:51.715 --> 19:53.824
'cause I have this big lunch
and I'll be all ready for you,”

19:53.864 --> 19:57.080
'cause normally, I wash and
condition her hair myself.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.005
You do?

19:58.317 --> 20:00.231
Mm-hmm. You know, like,
massage her scalp a bit,

20:00.271 --> 20:03.327
but she didn't want that yesterday.
She was obsessed about this lunch.

20:03.367 --> 20:06.103
Hey, how about a little color?

20:06.283 --> 20:07.244
For a funeral?

20:07.312 --> 20:09.029
Yeah, it's not that unusual.

20:09.069 --> 20:11.146
You'd be surprised at the
number of women out here

20:11.186 --> 20:14.006
who turn absolutely platinum with grief.

20:18.732 --> 20:22.602
You can see it's not for eveningwear,
but it's just glamorous for lunch.

20:22.642 --> 20:26.619
She was starving herself to fit
into it and wearing it out the door.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.215
Ok. These two are for you.

20:29.324 --> 20:33.032
Appropriate for funerals, but I think
they could also double up for evenings out.

20:33.072 --> 20:35.341
Well, they're very
pretty, Jeanine. Thank you.

20:35.381 --> 20:36.285
I'll just try 'em on.

20:36.325 --> 20:37.352
My pleasure.

20:37.482 --> 20:39.936
You're almost the same
size as Heather was.

20:39.976 --> 20:42.550
Of course, she wasn't modeling anymore.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.389
Well, uh, you've got great taste.

20:48.992 --> 20:51.500
She would have really
turned heads at—

20:51.651 --> 20:54.859
I'm sorry. I'm not from
around here. I forgot.

20:54.966 --> 20:57.301
What's the name of that
restaurant she was going to?

20:57.341 --> 20:59.606
Uh, she didn't offer
up too many details.

20:59.646 --> 21:01.462
Dean's the friendly one, really.

21:01.502 --> 21:03.954
Oh. So you shop for both of 'em.

21:04.047 --> 21:05.682
Mmm. And only them.

21:05.781 --> 21:08.828
I basically do rentals of
our couture lines to movies.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.914
Oh. So that's how you met Dean?

21:11.003 --> 21:14.070
Yes. That… is how I met Dean.

21:16.917 --> 21:19.821
And that's how you met
Heather, through him?

21:19.926 --> 21:22.822
And just how friendly
were you with Dean?

21:27.103 --> 21:29.861
Friendly enough to lose my husband.

21:31.735 --> 21:33.781
You live, and you learn, right?

21:34.387 --> 21:37.489
That's what I thought
you stopped by to ask me.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.694
Lindsey said you were
getting lots of calls.

21:41.671 --> 21:44.051
You know, you should try this one.

21:44.143 --> 21:46.189
It might help soften your eyes.

21:48.259 --> 21:50.474
I remember the first
time she came in with him,

21:50.514 --> 21:53.460
with Dean, and all the
girls were screaming,

21:53.542 --> 21:55.072
“Oh, it's Dean Kingsley.”

21:55.112 --> 21:58.957
Yuck. Those romantic comedies
he does, so 20th century.

21:59.054 --> 21:59.920
Don't move.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.782
Eyelashes. Eyelashes.

22:01.911 --> 22:05.056
And he flirted with me almost
right in front of his wife.

22:05.096 --> 22:05.888
Don't blink.

22:06.313 --> 22:09.612
And I was nice, but you know, get a
divorce before you start that stuff.

22:09.652 --> 22:11.032
Heh. So stupid.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.381
Ta-da. We're all done.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.626
Uh, hey, Isabel, which way is the
restaurant she was going to from here?

22:23.666 --> 22:24.726
Sirodo's?

22:24.802 --> 22:27.904
It's, uh, 2 blocks east
and one block north.

22:28.017 --> 22:31.132
11:30, she said, which is
a little early for lunch,

22:31.172 --> 22:33.812
but maybe she wanted to avoid the crowd.

22:33.909 --> 22:37.528
Ok, so we have the liner, the shadow,

22:37.699 --> 22:40.451
the night restorative,
the 2 foundations,

22:40.554 --> 22:45.166
which brings your total
to $531 and 22 cents.

22:50.187 --> 22:53.553
Would you like to take a
glance in my magic mirror?

22:53.665 --> 22:54.735
Oh, my god.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.013
I look completely different.

22:57.225 --> 22:58.215
You're welcome.

23:10.777 --> 23:11.786
Thank you.

23:12.962 --> 23:17.099
She was meeting someone
for lunch here around 11:30.

23:17.190 --> 23:19.630
Are you sure you have the right
restaurant? We don't do lunch.

23:19.670 --> 23:21.439
And yesterday—

23:21.977 --> 23:24.155
We don't serve at all on mondays.

23:25.729 --> 23:28.289
So who would be here around that time?

23:28.402 --> 23:30.695
Mm, just me taking reservations.

23:31.262 --> 23:32.763
Maybe if I had a name.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.246
Ok. Um…

23:35.471 --> 23:37.303
how about Heather Kingsley?

23:39.259 --> 23:41.486
Uh, ok. Kingsley.

23:42.001 --> 23:43.584
Kingsley, Kingsley, Kingsley.

23:43.624 --> 23:46.215
I'm surprised you don't
recognize the name, Ms Metcalf.

23:46.255 --> 23:47.809
She's been in the news a lot lately.

23:47.849 --> 23:49.026
She just died.

23:50.661 --> 23:53.412
Oh… that Heather Kingsley.

23:53.509 --> 23:56.083
Yes, Ms Metcalf. That Heather Kingsley.

23:56.673 --> 23:59.372
You look like you got
a little sun recently.

23:59.412 --> 24:01.854
Could it be that you've been sailing?

24:02.601 --> 24:04.767
Sailing? No. No, I, uh…

24:04.828 --> 24:06.340
Sgt. Gabriel, may I
have your phone, please?

24:06.380 --> 24:07.414
Yes, ma'am.

24:07.975 --> 24:10.627
It might interest you
to know, Ms Metcalf

24:10.667 --> 24:14.566
that Heather put a full 2 weeks of her
life into getting ready to confront you—

24:14.606 --> 24:16.975
new face, new hair, new dress.

24:17.077 --> 24:20.235
Yet despite everything she
did to change her appearance,

24:20.275 --> 24:22.836
she ended up looking like this.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.464
These are her brains on drugs.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.975
I was there when they popped her
skull open, and I took these photos.

24:29.015 --> 24:30.285
I am still…

24:30.878 --> 24:32.016
upset about it.

24:32.398 --> 24:35.866
Now, I've got detectives
down at the marina right now,

24:35.906 --> 24:39.100
so if you were there I'm
going to find out about it.

24:39.140 --> 24:43.562
I'm gonna ask you again. Were you
on a sailboat with Dean Kingsley?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.619
Yes, I was.

24:47.602 --> 24:50.836
I don't know why Dean
didn't want me to tell you.

24:50.919 --> 24:54.197
If you really are investigating
him for murder, I'm his alibi.

24:54.237 --> 24:56.521
Oh, no, Ms Metcalf.

24:56.815 --> 25:01.826
You're his motive.

25:00.971 --> 25:02.786
How'd you get a reservation here?

25:02.826 --> 25:05.079
I hear you normally have to
book this place a month ahead.

25:05.119 --> 25:08.617
I got to know the manager
pretty well this afternoon.

25:09.404 --> 25:12.536
So, what did your toxicologist say?

25:14.061 --> 25:16.161
He thinks nicotine poisoning.

25:17.904 --> 25:20.016
How long does that take to work?

25:20.980 --> 25:22.761
Depends on how the body absorbs it.

25:22.801 --> 25:26.389
But if, as you say, your
victim's scalp was hot,

25:26.637 --> 25:28.548
like it was just washed with warm water,

25:28.588 --> 25:31.798
the nicotine is pure, 15 minutes, maybe.

25:38.562 --> 25:39.325
What?

25:39.525 --> 25:40.570
You have a tag.

25:41.789 --> 25:44.688
Oh. Heh. I'm taking this back.

25:45.855 --> 25:50.261
And don't get used to me looking
like this, because I can't afford it.

25:50.301 --> 25:52.561
You ok, Brenda? You seem frazzled.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.692
Oh, I just—

25:54.097 --> 25:56.578
I can't make the pieces
fit together in this case,

25:56.618 --> 26:00.083
and every other street in the hills
is called Mulholland something.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.100
I thought you had a driver.

26:01.140 --> 26:05.166
Oh, I did, but I got mad at
him, and now I'm late everywhere.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.336
And all these women.

26:10.109 --> 26:11.073
What women?

26:11.186 --> 26:14.750
The women that Dean Kingsley
cheated on his wife with.

26:14.994 --> 26:17.537
I'm almost as mad at
them as I am at him.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.447
Because?

26:18.482 --> 26:20.367
Because they fell for his routine.

26:20.407 --> 26:22.500
“I love you. I want to marry you.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.190
I'm gonna leave my wife.”

26:24.298 --> 26:27.754
And then he drops 'em saying he
can't afford the divorce settlement,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.944
and he goes and picks up someone else.

26:29.984 --> 26:34.290
And all these women he dumps, they actually
go on and work for him in some weird way.

26:34.330 --> 26:35.486
Irritates me.

26:40.865 --> 26:41.582
What?

26:42.276 --> 26:44.982
–Nothing.
–What? What were you gonna say?

26:47.468 --> 26:49.165
Well, it's just…

26:50.471 --> 26:53.045
Isn't that what you did with Will Pope?

26:53.433 --> 26:55.679
You had an affair
with him in Washington.

26:55.719 --> 26:59.456
He told you he loved you, wanted
to divorce his wife, marry you.

26:59.496 --> 27:02.283
Then he dumped you, left
his wife for somebody else.

27:02.323 --> 27:05.755
Now you're here in L. A.
and you're working for him.

27:09.304 --> 27:11.415
Yeah. That's good.

27:11.726 --> 27:12.914
That's good. It's…

27:13.054 --> 27:15.146
It's a whole new perspective
on the case. Thank you.

27:15.186 --> 27:16.608
Ok, well, maybe I
shouldn't have said any—

27:16.648 --> 27:19.082
No, no, no. You know
what? It's fine. Really.

27:19.122 --> 27:20.394
Are you still not drinking?

27:20.434 --> 27:21.915
Because I could use a drink.

27:21.955 --> 27:23.275
Excuse me. Hi there.

27:23.402 --> 27:26.912
May I have a huge glass of
merlot, please? Thank you.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.033
It's good. You want some bread.

27:32.073 --> 27:33.195
–No, I'm ok.
–Ok.

27:36.659 --> 27:39.226
So, symptoms of nicotine poisoning:

27:39.417 --> 27:41.032
faintness, dizziness,

27:41.139 --> 27:45.024
respiratory distress,
paralysis, heart failure.

27:45.134 --> 27:47.365
Which is why you don't
put it in your hair.

27:47.405 --> 27:50.377
And after booking 43 different poisons,

27:50.609 --> 27:53.726
Flynn found nicotine
at the Kingsley house

27:53.925 --> 27:57.084
in the gardening shed
–insecticide.

27:57.422 --> 28:00.394
Now, I think this is
enough to bring him back,

28:00.434 --> 28:03.141
sweat him, maybe make a deal.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.812
I don't want a deal.

28:05.061 --> 28:07.437
But, chief, I really think
you're onto something, though,

28:07.477 --> 28:11.167
because Daniels and Sanchez
found this guy at the marina,

28:11.207 --> 28:12.743
and he says he saw Kingsley—

28:12.783 --> 28:15.819
I don't wanna make a deal,
ok? I want a confession.

28:15.859 --> 28:18.469
Now that we know what we're looking
for toxicology can move faster.

28:18.509 --> 28:19.704
Here's what I want you to do.

28:19.744 --> 28:23.850
And then take the pesticide
we found to our labs.

28:23.945 --> 28:26.098
Check to make sure they
each have nicotine in them

28:26.138 --> 28:30.443
and then make absolutely sure
it's the same kind of nicotine, ok?

28:30.533 --> 28:33.057
Thank you. Thank you, lieutenant Tao.

28:57.958 --> 28:58.966
Allow me.

29:00.202 --> 29:01.072
Oh, Brenda.

29:01.540 --> 29:05.400
Good. I was—I was just wondering
how we're doing with Dean Kingsley.

29:05.440 --> 29:09.367
Pretty Good. At least I know I'm
dealing with a two-timing adulterer

29:09.407 --> 29:11.526
whose specialty is making
women fall in love with him,

29:11.566 --> 29:13.588
by pretending he wants to marry 'em.

29:13.628 --> 29:14.491
Actors.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.789
Are you counting on
having him come back in?

29:16.829 --> 29:17.908
Yes, Will, I am.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.461
I don't think his lawyer's
gonna let him talk to you.

29:19.501 --> 29:21.915
Don't worry about it. I'll get
what I need from Dean Kingsley.

29:21.955 --> 29:23.967
Do you mind? I'm working on his alibi.

29:24.007 --> 29:24.874
Sure, ok.

29:25.258 --> 29:26.041
By the way…

29:28.182 --> 29:29.634
your hair looks great.

29:30.346 --> 29:33.775
Yeah, thanks. I like yours, too.

29:41.591 --> 29:43.583
This is Donny Holt.

29:43.723 --> 29:46.057
Donny, deputy chief Johnson.

29:46.165 --> 29:47.488
Hello, Mr Holt.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.280
Thank you so much for coming.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.340
Happy to help.

29:51.384 --> 29:54.321
He has the boat slip 2 over from
Dean Kingsley, isn't that right, sir?

29:54.361 --> 29:55.625
That's right.

29:57.571 --> 30:00.490
So, you know Mr Kingsley?
You're friendly with him?

30:00.530 --> 30:02.576
Yeah, we know each other, yeah.

30:02.636 --> 30:04.842
We talk boats, you know?

30:05.048 --> 30:08.142
As a matter of fact I helped
him antifoul his boat one day.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.830
Get the barnacles off.

30:10.336 --> 30:12.551
And do you recognize this woman?

30:14.437 --> 30:15.317
Oh, yeah.

30:15.758 --> 30:18.128
Yeah, that's the new
girlfriend, all right.

30:18.168 --> 30:20.214
Luckiest guy in the world, huh?

30:22.094 --> 30:23.019
Except…

30:23.976 --> 30:27.445
You know, I think his wife came
down one night not too long ago,

30:27.485 --> 30:29.710
and that was not fun.

30:29.824 --> 30:30.971
Really? You saw her?

30:31.011 --> 30:33.055
Buzz, turn that down.

30:33.468 --> 30:34.336
Yes, sir.

30:36.411 --> 30:37.898
What do you want, Flynn?

30:37.938 --> 30:40.978
Miss Atlanta's trying to get
Kingsley to talk to her again,

30:41.018 --> 30:43.166
but she's going about it all wrong,

30:43.206 --> 30:45.395
and I say we let her,

30:45.508 --> 30:48.515
that we don't go out
of our way to help her.

30:48.793 --> 30:53.818
Flynn, when have you ever known me to
go out of my way to help anybody ever?

31:00.253 --> 31:02.365
First saw her about 2 weeks ago.

31:02.416 --> 31:04.000
Seems kinda greedy to me

31:04.379 --> 31:06.134
to be married to someone like Heather

31:06.174 --> 31:08.380
and have all these ladies on the side.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.136
So on the day in question…

31:10.794 --> 31:15.419
Well, he sailed off with this
girl you showed me here around noon

31:15.517 --> 31:20.203
and didn't come back until I was
getting ready to go to work on Monday.

31:22.527 --> 31:24.771
Hey, will you take a look at that?

31:25.866 --> 31:27.911
She's making Kingsley's alibi.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.086
Flynn, out.

32:03.937 --> 32:07.855
So here I thought we were slamming, and
we just got hit with a ton of bad news.

32:07.895 --> 32:08.819
Let's hear it.

32:09.092 --> 32:11.746
The liquid nicotine in
Heather's conditioner

32:11.786 --> 32:14.968
didn't match up with the
pesticide we found at their house.

32:15.008 --> 32:16.849
It's 2 different concentrations.

32:16.889 --> 32:19.552
And the Kingsley
prenup? It doesn't exist.

32:19.592 --> 32:21.150
They didn't have one at all.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.741
Plus, you know, men don't
usually off their wives

32:23.781 --> 32:25.904
over someone they met 2 weeks ago.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.958
That's the voice of
experience, I suppose?

32:27.998 --> 32:29.042
Sorry, chief.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.790
Looks like you're gonna
have to start over.

32:30.830 --> 32:32.171
Actually, I'm not.

32:32.329 --> 32:35.405
The revised autopsy report
confirms exactly what I thought.

32:35.445 --> 32:37.990
The victim's death was accomplished
through a solution of liquid nicotine

32:38.030 --> 32:40.274
absorbed solely through the scalp.

32:40.995 --> 32:43.535
Add that to the fact that
we know his alibl is solid,

32:43.575 --> 32:44.821
the nicotine doesn't match,

32:44.861 --> 32:46.362
and there was no prenup,

32:46.402 --> 32:48.932
and I have Mr Kingsley
exactly where I want him.

32:48.972 --> 32:51.682
Lieutenant Flynn, if
you could do the honors.

32:51.722 --> 32:54.765
Arrest our movie star let
him spend the night in jail.

32:54.805 --> 32:56.767
Drive his lawyers insane.

32:56.979 --> 32:58.917
I'll talk to him in the morning.

32:58.957 --> 33:01.631
You don't have enough evidence
to charge him with murder.

33:01.671 --> 33:03.840
He lied when he said he
was alone on the boat,

33:03.880 --> 33:07.190
and he conspired with Alison Metcalf
to pass that lie on to the police.

33:07.230 --> 33:09.740
Conspiracy equals
obstruction of justice.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.100
You can start there.

33:11.235 --> 33:14.205
Good night, y'all. Have
a good night's sleep.

33:35.912 --> 33:38.222
Lieutenant, something on your mind?

33:38.351 --> 33:41.283
Yeah. I wanna talk to
you about your hair.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.858
You ask me, letting her
arrest Kingsley is a mistake.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.251
They got fans from all over
the country outside his house,

33:49.291 --> 33:51.522
and the media is parked in his driveway

33:51.562 --> 33:53.810
Till at least 11:30 every night.

33:53.902 --> 33:56.985
And we're saying this movie star,
who's banging new chicks all the time,

33:57.025 --> 33:59.924
suddenly went nutty over
some girl he met 2 weeks ago?

33:59.964 --> 34:01.451
Listen to him, chief.

34:01.621 --> 34:03.148
It's just not plausible.

34:03.188 --> 34:05.629
And the nicotine doesn't match.

34:05.731 --> 34:07.874
Well, we don't have to tell them that.

34:07.914 --> 34:09.891
Hey, it's not her fault.

34:09.991 --> 34:14.340
Maybe in Washington or Atlanta, she could
book on a suspect like this with no problem.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.382
I don't know.

34:15.565 --> 34:19.596
But even with all the C.I.A
training in the world—and she's good—

34:19.636 --> 34:23.170
Kingsley's lawyers are not
gonna let her do a thing, uh-uh,

34:23.210 --> 34:24.935
not on this evidence.

34:26.353 --> 34:28.784
But, hey, you know… it's your call.

34:29.382 --> 34:31.396
If you want us to arrest him,

34:32.091 --> 34:33.130
let's do it.

35:04.252 --> 35:05.819
Lieutenant Flynn, am I to understand

35:05.859 --> 35:08.773
you refused a direct order
to arrest Dean Kingsley?

35:08.813 --> 35:11.855
No, ma'am. That order was
countermanded by assistant chief Pope

35:11.895 --> 35:14.756
in the interest of our
department's reputation.

35:14.796 --> 35:19.647
And no one here thought I
should be informed of this?

35:29.174 --> 35:30.006
Well…

35:33.487 --> 35:34.835
All right, then.

35:35.603 --> 35:37.235
It's good to know where I stand.

35:37.275 --> 35:39.123
I'll just arrest him myself, then.

35:39.163 --> 35:41.147
Thank y'all very much.

35:47.463 --> 35:48.333
Damn it.

35:50.790 --> 35:54.071
Ok, ok, look, listen, is
there any possibility at all

35:54.111 --> 35:56.973
that charging Kingsley with a crime
might be the wrong thing to do?

35:57.013 --> 35:59.572
No, because it's the only way I can
get him to come in here and talk to me.

35:59.612 --> 36:01.588
Look, sergeant, if you're
afraid of helping me,

36:01.628 --> 36:03.820
I'm perfectly capable of
arresting him on my own.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.833
Yes, you could do that,

36:06.077 --> 36:07.563
but I want you to think
about something first.

36:07.603 --> 36:08.462
What?

36:08.565 --> 36:11.067
When you handcuff Dean Kingsley and
put him in the backseat of your car,

36:11.107 --> 36:14.291
you're gonna have helicopters, news
vans, and millions of television viewers

36:14.331 --> 36:16.052
all escorting you back
here to Parker Center.

36:16.092 --> 36:16.812
So?

36:16.924 --> 36:20.686
So, are you absolutely certain
that you can, by yourself,

36:20.881 --> 36:23.323
drive back here without getting lost?

36:29.049 --> 36:29.860
Thank you.

36:30.487 --> 36:34.777
Thank you. I know that was very
difficult for you, but thank you.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.505
This entire exercise is a waste of time.

36:41.545 --> 36:43.733
My client doesn't have to
talk to you, and he won't.

36:43.773 --> 36:46.311
But he does have to
listen to me, and he will,

36:46.351 --> 36:48.730
because I've been investigating
the death of his wife,

36:48.770 --> 36:51.699
and if Mr Kingsley doesn't help
me in say, the next 10 minutes,

36:51.739 --> 36:54.955
I'm gonna send him down to the the DA. 's
office and have him arraigned for murder.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.689
–Oh, my god.
–On what evidence?

36:56.729 --> 37:00.956
–…nicotine on his wife's head. Further…
–You didn't authorize this?

37:00.996 --> 37:01.937
Surprised?

37:03.027 --> 37:03.880
Oh, well.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.769
Maybe she has a plan or something.

37:06.809 --> 37:10.231
…he was not alone. He was with a
woman with whom he was having an affair.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.323
Oh, and by the way, being on a
boat when your wife drops dead,

37:13.363 --> 37:16.483
that's just not very original, Mr
Kingsley, even by hollywood standards.

37:16.523 --> 37:17.980
It's all circumstantial.

37:18.020 --> 37:21.171
I'm perfectly willing to
let a judge decide that,

37:21.211 --> 37:24.788
because Mr Kingsley here is
responsible for killing his wife.

37:24.828 --> 37:28.310
–Look, I would never—
–Dean, sit down.

37:28.418 --> 37:31.220
No! And she's gotta
know I would never, ever—

37:31.260 --> 37:32.166
Sit down and shut up.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.426
But you are responsible
for her death, Mr Kingsley,

37:34.466 --> 37:36.396
or did it never once occur to you, sir,

37:36.436 --> 37:38.582
that while dumping all
these poor, gullible women

37:38.622 --> 37:41.162
who are stupid enough
to fall in love with you,

37:41.202 --> 37:44.134
when telling them that you wanted
to divorce Heather and marry them

37:44.174 --> 37:47.410
but that you couldn't because
of this nonexistent prenup,

37:47.450 --> 37:49.198
did it never once occur to you, sir,

37:49.238 --> 37:52.010
that one of them might
take you seriously?

37:58.108 --> 38:01.210
That is not a rhetorical
question, Mr Kingsley.

38:05.463 --> 38:06.579
Oh, my god.

38:13.598 --> 38:14.845
Oh, my god.

38:17.552 --> 38:19.174
I'll take that as a no.

38:21.740 --> 38:24.005
I'd like you to make
a list of all the women

38:24.045 --> 38:28.369
that you've played this particular
game with over the last 3 years,

38:28.409 --> 38:31.503
and then I'd like you to
sign this custody agreement,

38:31.543 --> 38:34.513
because I'm going to
need it to make my case.

38:54.137 --> 38:56.082
Thank you.

39:00.335 --> 39:03.907
I just—I can't seem to get
it the way you had it before.

39:03.947 --> 39:07.367
Sit down, please. You're
doing it wrong, for one thing.

39:07.407 --> 39:08.141
Sorry.

39:12.699 --> 39:13.812
Let me get this.

39:17.788 --> 39:18.985
So, I, uh,

39:19.295 --> 39:22.528
saw you arrested Dean
Kingsley this morning.

39:22.975 --> 39:24.701
It's just, like, ridiculous, you know?

39:24.741 --> 39:27.315
He would never do
anything to hurt his wife.

39:27.355 --> 39:29.679
Well, you may be right about that.

39:30.258 --> 39:31.997
Turns out he has a good alibi.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.799
On his sailboat with an
extremely attractive young woman.

39:36.054 --> 39:38.364
He just started up this new affair.

39:39.278 --> 39:43.039
Yeah, some restaurant manager
in Beverly Hills. Really pretty.

39:43.079 --> 39:45.600
Oh, hey! Did I tell you this?

39:45.762 --> 39:49.684
One of my colleagues recognized
the hair do you gave me.

39:49.901 --> 39:55.050
It's just like the one you gave the woman
who played opposite Dean in his last movie.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.202
I looked it up on the crew list.

39:57.281 --> 39:59.107
You were in the makeup trailer.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.391
That's how you knew him, isn't it?

40:03.908 --> 40:05.197
Tell me, Jennifer,

40:06.073 --> 40:07.987
did he ever take you sailin'?

40:08.906 --> 40:10.546
He took most of his girlfriends sailin'.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.703
Most? I'm not his girlfriend.

40:12.822 --> 40:14.006
Hi, Jennifer.

40:15.928 --> 40:18.070
Remember me?

40:22.821 --> 40:25.139
Does Mr Holt jog your memory?

40:26.804 --> 40:29.565
You see, he referred to the
present girlfriend as the new one,

40:29.605 --> 40:32.542
which, of course, made me wonder
who the last one might have been.

40:32.582 --> 40:34.760
Oh, and the autopsy report

40:34.844 --> 40:38.672
said that Heather absorbed
nicotine solely through her scalp,

40:38.712 --> 40:40.464
so she couldn't have done it herself,

40:40.504 --> 40:42.756
because some of ot would
have seeped in on her hands,

40:42.796 --> 40:46.228
and, Jennifer, you were
the only other person there.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.304
You said so yourself.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.912
You are not alone.

41:04.548 --> 41:08.347
Here's a list of a lot of other
women that he said that he would marry

41:08.387 --> 41:11.093
if only Heather would
give him a divorce.

41:11.658 --> 41:13.506
And you know the worst part?

41:14.171 --> 41:15.500
There was no prenup.

41:15.598 --> 41:16.972
There was a prenup.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.957
He told me. He gave me all the details.

41:19.997 --> 41:22.084
He's an actor, Jennifer. He lied.

41:22.124 --> 41:23.776
That's what he does for a livin'.

41:23.816 --> 41:26.327
I did not kill her.

41:26.686 --> 41:29.495
I didn't. I mean, it
was a suicide, maybe.

41:29.576 --> 41:32.570
Ok, ok, let me walk you through it.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.862
You washed Heather's hair and
conditioned it, just like you always do.

41:36.902 --> 41:38.845
Only, this time, you wore gloves,

41:38.885 --> 41:41.858
because you didn't wanna get any
of the nicotine on your hands.

41:41.898 --> 41:44.472
And after you massaged it in real well,

41:44.711 --> 41:46.963
she went to the shower
to shave her legs,

41:47.003 --> 41:49.980
and you waited until she died,

41:50.120 --> 41:53.395
and then you went in
to clean up a little,

41:53.529 --> 41:56.795
but you took the razor by mistake.

41:57.376 --> 42:00.361
Well, you were nervous,
and you wanted to be neat,

42:00.401 --> 42:02.653
and on the way home,
you got rid of it all:

42:02.693 --> 42:06.118
the poison and the razor and the gloves.

42:06.632 --> 42:07.896
Now, Jennifer,

42:08.363 --> 42:11.315
because you believed Dean's lies,

42:11.491 --> 42:15.550
he sails off into the sunset with
his new girlfriend and your baby.

42:15.590 --> 42:18.758
She'll be the mother now.
Is that what you want?

42:23.039 --> 42:25.185
See what we have here, Jennifer?

42:26.408 --> 42:29.711
You tell us where you dumped everything,
and we give you this agreement

42:29.751 --> 42:32.985
where Mr Kingsley signs
away his parental rights.

42:33.958 --> 42:38.399
You could have your child raised by your
parents, could come visit you or something.

42:38.439 --> 42:40.353
Shouldn't I have an attorney?

42:40.752 --> 42:42.666
We could get you an attorney,

42:43.018 --> 42:47.448
but if we did that before
you tell me what I wanna know,

42:48.443 --> 42:50.643
I'll tear this agreement
up into tiny pieces,

42:50.683 --> 42:52.881
and Dean will walk away with
your baby the moment it's born.

42:52.921 --> 42:54.413
No. No.

42:54.494 --> 42:57.132
Ok. I…

42:59.878 --> 43:04.787
I took everything I used, and I
put it in a green plastic trash bag,

43:04.875 --> 43:06.357
and I tossed it.

43:09.785 --> 43:11.721
I thought he loved me.

43:13.868 --> 43:17.496
I thought we would have the baby.

43:23.044 --> 43:25.658
Just hold on one second.

43:26.101 --> 43:28.346
Where did you throw the trash bag?

43:28.550 --> 43:32.030
Somewhere on Mulholland Drive.

43:33.744 --> 43:36.632
Could you be a little more specific?

43:38.266 --> 43:39.586
No, I never saw it.

43:40.060 --> 43:41.145
How'd I look?

43:42.488 --> 43:44.028
Oh, you're kidding me.

43:44.399 --> 43:47.132
Oh, daddy, tell me you
did not video-record me

43:47.172 --> 43:50.208
arresting Dean Kingsley
in front on his house.

43:50.373 --> 43:53.112
You didn't! Oh…

43:55.010 --> 43:57.716
Well, I guess they
were playing it a lot.

43:58.609 --> 44:00.993
All right, send it along, then.

44:03.050 --> 44:03.848
Really?

44:04.338 --> 44:05.460
How much younger?

44:08.208 --> 44:11.034
Oh, that's just me
looking for a receipt.

44:11.286 --> 44:12.606
I'm returning stuff.

44:15.506 --> 44:17.426
5 years younger? Really?

44:18.888 --> 44:20.829
I don't know, daddy.

44:21.118 --> 44:25.408
It's a lot of time and expense
to look that way on a daily basis.

44:25.683 --> 44:30.900
Oh, no, no. Don't send me any
money. Don't be ridiculous.

44:32.143 --> 44:33.097
Well…

44:34.477 --> 44:36.938
my birthday is coming up next month.

44:40.148 --> 44:42.874
Yeah. Go on.

44:43.995 --> 44:45.411
Send it along, then.

44:46.478 --> 44:47.422
Ok.

44:48.813 --> 44:50.362
I love you, too.
