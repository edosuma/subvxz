<i>on</i> Beauty & the Beast:

00:03.591 --> 00:05.358
Dad!

00:05.426 --> 00:08.393
There was no match between
Catherine's blood and your father.

00:14.767 --> 00:15.967
Vincent!

00:16.035 --> 00:18.870
Don't shoot. She's my daughter.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.974
Vincent!
It's okay. It's over.

00:23.710 --> 00:24.908
All that matters

00:24.976 --> 00:26.176
is that you're back safe.

00:26.245 --> 00:28.979
I never stopped looking for you.

00:29.047 --> 00:32.250
Who are you?

00:32.317 --> 00:33.651
Aren't you
a little concerned

00:33.719 --> 00:34.885
about what Muirfield did
to Vincent?

00:34.953 --> 00:36.086
He's a little scary.

00:36.154 --> 00:38.222
Vincent would never hurt me.

00:38.290 --> 00:41.891
Cat, you said yourself
he doesn't remember you.

00:47.732 --> 00:49.232
There are more
of them out there.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.433
<i>Who pays for that boat?</i>

00:50.501 --> 00:51.701
Is someone
controlling you?

00:51.769 --> 00:53.035
I don't even know
who you are!

01:08.785 --> 01:11.520
Hey, it's Cat.
I think I have an idea about

01:11.588 --> 01:14.021
how to deal with this whole
Vincent situation.

01:14.089 --> 01:17.692
Just got one little hitch.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.361
I can be there in 20 minutes.
I'll see you soon.

01:23.131 --> 01:24.732
Morning!

01:24.800 --> 01:26.301
Heathe?

01:26.368 --> 01:28.368
Hey, I was just trying
to catch you before work.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.103
Uh, yeah, just give me
two seconds.

01:30.171 --> 01:31.438
All right. No worries.

01:31.506 --> 01:32.439
I brought coffee.

01:44.618 --> 01:47.820
Hi! I am so sorry
I haven't called you back.

01:47.887 --> 01:49.988
I know you wanted
to talk, so...

01:50.056 --> 01:51.976
No, don't worry about it.
You've been super busy,

01:52.025 --> 01:53.726
and it's not like
I've been around either.

01:53.794 --> 01:55.155
I haven't slept in
my bed in weeks.

01:55.195 --> 01:57.330
Hey, is something
wrong with your neck?

01:57.397 --> 01:59.264
Uh, nope,
just slept on it funny.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.898
You know, I get it,
you've been

02:00.966 --> 02:02.434
helping with Dad's house,

02:02.501 --> 02:06.338
and-and Brooke, and you
are so the better daughter.

02:06.405 --> 02:08.673
No. I'm the unemployed daughter.

02:08.741 --> 02:12.009
But, um, that maybe
is about to change.

02:12.077 --> 02:13.277
What, you got a job?

02:13.346 --> 02:14.813
Senior event coordinator
at QMK.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.181
It's one of the top PR firms
in the country.

02:18.249 --> 02:19.983
Wow. That is amazing.

02:20.051 --> 02:22.586
Yeah, yeah.
It, um, it's in Miami.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.757
Okay, maybe
a little less amazing.

02:26.825 --> 02:28.425
But you know what?

02:28.493 --> 02:30.527
I haven't decided
if I'm gonna take it yet.

02:30.595 --> 02:32.829
I mean, we just lost Dad,

02:32.896 --> 02:35.865
and, um, they need me
to let them know by tomorrow.

02:35.932 --> 02:37.299
You need advice?

02:37.368 --> 02:40.269
Yeah, and to talk about stuff.

02:40.337 --> 02:43.339
Okay, well, I have
to meet my boss this morning,

02:43.407 --> 02:44.607
but let's get together later,

02:44.675 --> 02:46.342
have a coffee, and we can make

02:46.410 --> 02:47.810
a pros
and cons list.

02:47.878 --> 02:50.178
Yeah. And, um, chat
about life... and Dad.

02:50.246 --> 02:52.180
Totally.
We will figure it out.

02:52.248 --> 02:53.515
Yeah.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.391
What...?

03:00.289 --> 03:02.891
Uh, initially, yes,

03:02.958 --> 03:04.992
and then I got
this deep tissue massage

03:05.059 --> 03:08.362
that was probably too deep.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.664
You think, you think
I need a scarf?

03:10.732 --> 03:13.133
Yeah, people are gonna think
you have an abusive boyfriend.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.970
Well, okay.

03:17.038 --> 03:18.739
Thank you.

03:23.076 --> 03:24.043
Hey.

03:26.881 --> 03:28.214
Vincent, hey.

03:28.282 --> 03:30.817
Hey. I'm-I'm sorry,
but I knocked.

03:30.885 --> 03:35.555
Oh, uh, it's okay, this is where
you live... or lived.

03:36.923 --> 03:39.157
Uh, keeps me motivated.

03:39.225 --> 03:41.226
The beat, not the lyrics.

03:41.294 --> 03:42.761
Have you seen Catherine
anywhere?

03:42.829 --> 03:44.496
Do you know if she's okay?

03:44.564 --> 03:47.232
Oh, she's great.
Happy to have you back.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.701
We-We both are.

03:49.769 --> 03:53.905
Look, if-if you're sensing
any weirdness on her part,

03:53.972 --> 03:56.841
it's probably just that
she wants you to remember,

03:56.909 --> 03:58.910
and I know that's
a lot of pressure, but...

03:58.977 --> 04:02.880
Yeah. Look, could you just tell
her that I'm sorry?

04:02.948 --> 04:04.682
Don't apologize.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.184
It's like head trauma;
these things take a while.

04:07.252 --> 04:08.919
But I can fill in

04:08.986 --> 04:10.720
some blanks for you, you know?

04:10.788 --> 04:11.888
Relationship highlights.

04:11.956 --> 04:12.789
No. No, that's...

04:12.857 --> 04:14.023
Just so you're familiar

04:14.091 --> 04:16.291
with the facts.
I'm not expecting

04:16.360 --> 04:18.595
to jog anything,
so, uh,

04:18.663 --> 04:20.964
you crashed her dad's wedding.
That was a big moment.

04:21.031 --> 04:24.033
Uh, oh, and the hotel pool.

04:24.101 --> 04:25.435
We thought we'd cured you,

04:25.502 --> 04:27.636
so you two went to the Ashcroft

04:27.704 --> 04:29.905
and got swimsuits
at the gift shop.

04:29.974 --> 04:32.075
But, I-I know

04:32.142 --> 04:33.609
cause it was on my credit card,

04:33.677 --> 04:35.544
but you don't have
to pay me back.

04:35.612 --> 04:37.746
I hurt her.

04:41.484 --> 04:43.085
Physically?

04:43.152 --> 04:47.322
She was... asking questions,

04:47.390 --> 04:49.324
things that I can't talk about.

04:49.392 --> 04:54.929
And I got, I got frustrated,
and I got overwhelmed.

04:54.998 --> 04:56.431
I just, I felt cornered.

04:56.499 --> 04:57.564
But she's okay, right?

04:57.632 --> 05:00.601
She seemed to be fine, but...

05:00.668 --> 05:01.935
But what?

05:02.004 --> 05:03.737
If I can't tell her...

05:03.805 --> 05:05.339
I feel terrible about it, okay?

05:05.407 --> 05:06.640
That's why I'm here.

05:07.976 --> 05:09.276
Could you
just tell her

05:09.344 --> 05:10.677
that it'll never
happen again

05:10.745 --> 05:13.646
and I will stay away?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.483
It's just...

05:16.550 --> 05:18.818
after everything
you two have been through,

05:18.886 --> 05:21.754
I don't know if that'll be
what she wants.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.824
It doesn't matter.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.926
I don't want to hurt her

05:26.994 --> 05:28.495
and I can't tell her
the truth,

05:28.562 --> 05:33.765
so... just please check on her.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.174
Condor?

05:42.242 --> 05:43.375
You at your computer?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.209
No, I'm heading there now.

05:45.277 --> 05:46.877
I found another target,
but I may have been exposed.

05:46.945 --> 05:48.146
That's why
I'm calling you first.

05:48.213 --> 05:51.782
I'm sending you the details
right now.

05:52.884 --> 05:56.720
It's not much, but if you...

05:57.356 --> 05:58.189
Sir?

05:58.257 --> 05:59.524
What the...?

05:59.591 --> 06:00.958
Agent Tucker, are you there?

06:02.861 --> 06:04.028
The final seconds can be

06:04.095 --> 06:05.295
unbearable or peaceful,
your choice.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.499
Tell me how you found me.

06:11.235 --> 06:12.770
Screw you!

06:17.075 --> 06:18.041
Who is this?

06:26.216 --> 06:27.483
So, how are you?

06:27.551 --> 06:29.018
Obviously, I've been better.

06:29.086 --> 06:30.954
I'm wearing
a non-regulation scarf.

06:31.021 --> 06:32.722
Right. Sorry.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.957
It's just that he's never done
anything like this before.

06:35.024 --> 06:36.892
We both know that someone's
controlling him, but when

06:36.960 --> 06:39.661
I came at him with questions...

06:39.729 --> 06:41.029
No, of course not,

06:41.097 --> 06:43.498
but this isn't exactly
a domestic violence case.

06:43.566 --> 06:47.836
Vincent is more of a victim
than anyone.

06:47.904 --> 06:50.838
But this isn't just about him
anymore, it's about the public.

06:50.906 --> 06:52.640
You told me yourself

06:52.708 --> 06:55.542
that Muirfield made beasts
for profit.

06:55.611 --> 06:56.978
We already know that
they sold one,

06:57.045 --> 06:59.480
which means
they probably sold others.

06:59.547 --> 07:03.183
There could be metaphorical
scarves everywhere.

07:03.251 --> 07:06.152
And I can't just be direct and
ask him about it, clearly.

07:06.220 --> 07:07.821
Right.

07:07.888 --> 07:09.689
So you said
you had an idea?

07:09.757 --> 07:11.992
You were on Vincent's houseboat,
you saw the sat-phone

07:12.059 --> 07:14.193
and the computer. Those things,
they hold answers,

07:14.261 --> 07:16.496
or at least leads to whoever's
pulling his strings,

07:16.563 --> 07:17.831
so we can cut them.

07:17.898 --> 07:19.866
You want to sneak on his boat?

07:19.934 --> 07:21.601
I'm sorry.

07:21.669 --> 07:24.203
He's a super-charged beast
with hyper senses.

07:24.271 --> 07:25.704
What if he catches us?

07:25.772 --> 07:28.441
That's just it,
it shouldn't be "us".

07:28.509 --> 07:31.010
You and Tess should be backup,
then I can go in there.

07:31.077 --> 07:32.278
And if he catches me,

07:32.346 --> 07:35.381
I can just say
I came by to say hi.

07:35.449 --> 07:37.683
Hi? That's your big idea?

07:37.751 --> 07:39.217
You are so literal. I would

07:39.285 --> 07:40.585
obviously come up
with something better,

07:40.653 --> 07:41.919
like, "I'm here
to talk about

07:41.987 --> 07:43.455
our relationship."

07:43.523 --> 07:48.460
Vincent and I were
just together romantically.

07:48.528 --> 07:52.030
But I am offering to use our
relationship to our advantage.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.599
I would pretend
to still be pursuing him,

07:55.667 --> 07:57.301
when in reality,
we'd be investigating

07:57.369 --> 07:59.069
to find out who's doing
this to him.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.472
Okay, on the phone you said
there was a hitch.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.940
Is there one, other
than the obvious?

08:04.008 --> 08:06.243
Yeah. He can sense when someone
isn't being honest.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.445
That's a pretty big hitch
when you're talking about

08:08.513 --> 08:09.746
basically going undercover.
Maybe there's

08:09.814 --> 08:11.080
a way around it.

08:11.148 --> 08:13.416
I still care about him,
that's honest.

08:13.484 --> 08:15.485
It's Tess.

08:15.553 --> 08:16.952
Okay, she doesn't know about...

08:17.020 --> 08:19.055
Just, she already has problems
with Vincent...

08:19.122 --> 08:21.257
It's not my story to tell.

08:21.325 --> 08:22.392
I get that I can't be with him,

08:22.459 --> 08:23.780
but I just can't hear it
from her.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.994
Catherine, I'm gonna answer
the phone now.

08:25.062 --> 08:26.662
Okay.
Okay.

08:28.898 --> 08:31.132
Hey, you have both of us.
You find anything?

08:31.201 --> 08:33.335
It looks like we may have
another beast attack.

08:50.883 --> 08:53.217
Body was discovered
about a half hour ago.

08:53.218 --> 08:55.052
I heard them describing the
victim's wound on Dispatch,

08:55.120 --> 08:56.420
so I jumped on it.

08:56.487 --> 08:57.955
We know who he is?

08:58.023 --> 08:59.289
There's no wallet,
no phone,

08:59.357 --> 09:00.758
but the car's registered
to the FBI.

09:00.826 --> 09:03.894
FBI? We need to get hold
of that security footage

09:03.962 --> 09:05.395
before anyone else does.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.130
You think this was Vincent?

09:07.198 --> 09:08.832
No way. He kills bad guys,
not government officials.

09:08.899 --> 09:10.166
We don't know that yet.
Gabe...

09:10.234 --> 09:11.735
I don't want to hear
about that boat.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.470
Whose boat, Vincent's?
You just said this wasn't him.

09:14.538 --> 09:17.607
Your partner wants
to go undercover,

09:17.674 --> 09:18.842
pretend she's his girlfriend,

09:18.909 --> 09:20.243
even though she is
his girlfriend,

09:20.310 --> 09:21.611
even though
he doesn't remember that.

09:21.678 --> 09:23.612
To find out who's
controlling him.

09:23.679 --> 09:24.847
We've got a dead FBI guy,

09:24.914 --> 09:26.348
and you're still on saving
your boyfriend?

09:26.415 --> 09:27.783
I'm on protecting
the public.

09:27.851 --> 09:31.353
Whatever's going on
with Vincent,

09:31.420 --> 09:32.788
Detectives.

09:32.856 --> 09:34.489
Special Agent Reynolds.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.324
I heard you might
have one of ours.

09:36.392 --> 09:37.860
Actually,
we don't have an I.D. yet.

09:37.927 --> 09:40.294
Well, then why don't you fill me
in on what you do know?

09:40.362 --> 09:43.131
Agent Reynolds, Catherine
Chandler. We met before.

09:43.198 --> 09:44.531
Thomas' daughter?

09:44.599 --> 09:47.434
Right.
At your dad's tribute.

09:47.502 --> 09:51.272
Another morbid occasion. Uh,
but if you give me your card,

09:51.339 --> 09:53.841
I will happily keep you updated
on our investigation.

09:53.909 --> 09:56.843
Actually, I think we're gonna
take this over from here.

09:56.911 --> 09:58.678
I hate to seem territorial,

09:58.746 --> 10:00.881
but this hasn't been ruled a
federal investigation yet, so...

10:00.948 --> 10:02.315
Excuse me a minute.

10:02.383 --> 10:03.784
Well, who is it
that rules...?

10:03.851 --> 10:05.652
JT, this isn't a good time.

10:05.719 --> 10:08.121
Listen, if Vincent ever does
something like this, you need

10:08.189 --> 10:09.289
to call me ASAP.

10:09.356 --> 10:11.157
Wait-- so he <i>did</i> kill
an FBI agent?

10:11.224 --> 10:13.225
What? No.

10:13.293 --> 10:14.559
I-I mean, I don't know.

10:14.627 --> 10:15.995
I'm talking about
what he did to you.

10:16.062 --> 10:17.629
He was just here.

10:17.697 --> 10:18.998
First, I thought he felt guilty

10:19.065 --> 10:20.825
'cause he doesn't remember you,
so I gave him

10:20.867 --> 10:22.201
the Cliff Notes version
of your relationship.

10:22.269 --> 10:23.335
Okay, hold on one second.

10:23.403 --> 10:24.904
When was this?

10:24.971 --> 10:26.338
Uh, like, an hour ago.

10:26.406 --> 10:30.241
Tess!
Do we have a time of death?

10:30.309 --> 10:31.409
45 minutes ago.

10:31.476 --> 10:33.577
I'll call you back.

10:35.747 --> 10:38.382
JT just alibied Vincent out,
so it was another one.

10:38.450 --> 10:42.253
I don't know
if I'm relieved or disturbed.

10:42.321 --> 10:45.088
I'm not saying that Vincent's
laptop wouldn't be

10:45.156 --> 10:47.657
helpful right now,
but he is a human polygraph.

10:47.725 --> 10:50.493
Tess, you know those party
tricks you used to do

10:50.561 --> 10:51.895
where you taught people how
to cheat them?

10:51.963 --> 10:53.163
I need you to teach me.

10:58.969 --> 11:01.337
Sweating's
the key indicator of lying.

11:01.404 --> 11:03.206
So we're blocking
the sweat glands.

11:03.273 --> 11:04.506
Isn't he going to smell this?

11:04.574 --> 11:05.441
It's not deodorant.

11:05.508 --> 11:07.243
It's antiperspirant.

11:07.311 --> 11:08.751
Okay, this can't be good
for my skin.

11:08.778 --> 11:10.579
Put this in your shoe.

11:10.647 --> 11:11.848
Okay.

11:14.684 --> 11:17.018
Ow.
Pain raises your vitals.

11:17.086 --> 11:18.186
So does lying.

11:18.254 --> 11:19.754
We need to get you to
keep your heart rate

11:19.822 --> 11:21.389
and your blood pressure
the same when you're lying

11:21.457 --> 11:23.024
and when you're not.
Okay, so I press on the tack

11:23.092 --> 11:24.860
when I'm telling the truth.

11:24.927 --> 11:26.794
But not when I'm lying.
Yes.

11:26.863 --> 11:29.464
Okay, let's start with something
we all know is true.

11:29.531 --> 11:31.866
Do you like ice cream?

11:31.933 --> 11:33.934
Yes.
And you're pushing on the pin?

11:34.002 --> 11:36.370
Yes.
Now we have a baseline.

11:36.437 --> 11:38.438
She's good at this.

11:38.506 --> 11:40.307
Then again, you've had
to lie on account of Vincent

11:40.375 --> 11:41.308
for over a year, so....

11:41.376 --> 11:42.542
All right, next question.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.577
What's with the scarf?

11:43.644 --> 11:45.145
I've been wondering all day.

11:45.213 --> 11:46.247
I got a hickey.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.981
No change.

11:48.048 --> 11:49.249
A hickey?

11:49.316 --> 11:50.716
Oh, my God,
so we are doing all this

11:50.784 --> 11:51.918
to save your boyfriend.

11:51.986 --> 11:53.719
No, this is before I realized

11:53.787 --> 11:56.155
that he has
too much baggage right now.

11:56.223 --> 11:57.490
Whatever, she passed.

11:57.557 --> 11:58.925
She did? What was the lie?

11:58.993 --> 11:59.792
I don't like ice cream.

11:59.860 --> 12:00.894
Okay...

12:00.961 --> 12:02.828
let's get her on that boat.

12:04.864 --> 12:06.598
Condor.

12:06.665 --> 12:08.433
We have a situation.
Is it Tucker?

12:08.501 --> 12:11.136
I was on the phone with him
when it happened.

12:11.204 --> 12:12.737
And I think the new target
did it, sir.

12:12.805 --> 12:13.906
What are you talking about?

12:13.973 --> 12:15.240
I heard him ask Tucker

12:15.308 --> 12:17.009
how he'd found him.

12:17.076 --> 12:18.010
Who is this guy?

12:18.077 --> 12:19.843
Could be one of a few.

12:19.912 --> 12:21.312
Tucker's job was to identify
them and report to me,

12:21.380 --> 12:22.613
which he failed to do.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.815
Well, he tried
to get an e-mail out.

12:24.883 --> 12:27.952
All I've got so far is
"Friday at 5:00, it's a..."

12:28.020 --> 12:29.586
Is a what?

12:29.654 --> 12:32.589
I'm still trying to access
more from the file, sir.

12:32.657 --> 12:34.458
No time.
Get to the crime scene.

12:34.526 --> 12:35.758
Figure out what beast
we're up against.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.193
If it was on to Tucker,

12:37.261 --> 12:39.195
it won't be long
till it's on to us.

13:01.351 --> 13:03.118
Hello?
You must be the one

13:03.186 --> 13:04.686
he was going to send after me.

13:07.089 --> 13:08.856
Why don't you come out and
introduce yourself in person?

13:08.924 --> 13:10.791
Aw, but this is

13:10.859 --> 13:11.859
so much more fun.

13:13.963 --> 13:15.896
Well, I don't play games.

13:17.933 --> 13:18.833
It's not a game.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.835
It's magic.

13:29.110 --> 13:31.511
And I know
all your tricks.

13:31.579 --> 13:34.047
Listening for my heartbeat?
Ba-bum...

13:34.115 --> 13:36.749
ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.920
So what's happening
Friday at 5:00?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.522
Try and stop me.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.424
I'll make sure you're
crossed off that list

13:45.492 --> 13:46.758
sooner than anyone intended.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.762
You don't know
about the list, do you?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.864
I'd be careful if I were you.

14:00.572 --> 14:01.906
Are you here?

14:01.974 --> 14:04.242
I just came to talk
about our relationship.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.443
Don't volunteer information.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.012
I'm just practicing.

14:07.079 --> 14:08.013
How are my vitals?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.048
Elevated but stable.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.615
That's because I have a tack

14:11.682 --> 14:13.884
in my shoe.

14:13.951 --> 14:15.019
His laptop's open
to an e-mail that was sent

14:15.086 --> 14:16.520
at the time of the murder.

14:16.587 --> 14:19.223
There seems to be an attachment.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.558
- It looks coded.
- He's coming.

14:21.626 --> 14:22.792
I'm downloading
the file right now.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.061
No, no, no, forget the file.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.362
He's moving fast,
and he looks pissed.

14:25.430 --> 14:26.363
Her pressure just went
through the roof.

14:26.431 --> 14:28.031
Got it.

14:31.101 --> 14:32.435
Hi.

14:32.503 --> 14:34.870
Hi.

14:37.207 --> 14:39.208
How did you, uh...?

14:39.276 --> 14:40.243
The door was unlocked.

14:43.646 --> 14:44.946
Look, um...

14:45.014 --> 14:48.550
I'm-I'm so sorry about what...

14:50.520 --> 14:52.087
Are you okay?

14:53.189 --> 14:55.057
Yeah.

14:55.124 --> 14:58.260
I just came to talk
about our relationship.

14:58.327 --> 15:00.661
Good. Great.

15:00.728 --> 15:02.663
Uh, can I get you a water?

15:02.730 --> 15:04.065
At least she's not over-talking.

15:04.132 --> 15:05.266
What?

15:05.333 --> 15:06.267
What?

15:08.303 --> 15:10.137
I thought you just...
you said something else.

15:10.205 --> 15:12.473
Did I? My-my thoughts are
just swirling in my head.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.775
Yeah, of course they are.

15:14.842 --> 15:16.242
Look, I'm sorry,

15:16.310 --> 15:17.310
I just... I cut you off.

15:17.378 --> 15:18.978
You came to say something.

15:19.046 --> 15:20.846
Please, say it, I deserve it.

15:20.914 --> 15:22.148
You can't do that again.

15:22.216 --> 15:25.151
You just, you can't
cross that line.

15:25.219 --> 15:26.419
You could've...

15:26.487 --> 15:28.421
I know...

15:28.489 --> 15:31.457
I know and believe me,
it is killing me.

15:31.524 --> 15:33.592
and I would understand if you
never want to see me again.

15:33.659 --> 15:36.095
This can't just be
because of a hickey.

15:36.162 --> 15:39.164
Well, obviously I do--
I'm here, aren't I?

15:39.232 --> 15:41.100
You're scared.

15:42.668 --> 15:44.536
It's just my shoe,
it's killing me.

15:44.604 --> 15:46.705
Look, can we just,
maybe start again?

15:46.772 --> 15:49.974
Because I was having such a
great time with you, up un...

15:50.041 --> 15:50.975
So was I.

15:52.544 --> 15:55.612
So, um, it would have
to be with-without...

15:55.679 --> 15:57.714
Without me asking any questions?

15:57.781 --> 16:00.550
Yeah, you know, kind of like
"don't ask, don't tell."

16:00.618 --> 16:02.852
Like that ever works.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.953
Yeah, we can just talk
about current events

16:04.021 --> 16:05.489
and the weather.
Mm-hmm.

16:05.556 --> 16:07.157
How about tonight?

16:07.225 --> 16:08.625
I mean, I could
come by yours...

16:08.692 --> 16:11.059
if you're free and...
7:00 p.m. maybe?

16:11.128 --> 16:13.229
Yeah, that sounds great.

16:13.296 --> 16:15.664
Okay.

16:17.033 --> 16:20.169
Catherine?

16:20.237 --> 16:22.638
Uh, thank you.

16:22.705 --> 16:24.507
For what?

16:24.574 --> 16:27.875
For giving me another shot.

16:39.923 --> 16:43.274
JT, thanks for coming.
The FBI are all over this case,

16:43.275 --> 16:46.344
so we need to crack it before
they start seeing beasts, too.

16:46.345 --> 16:48.786
This is what you need decoded?
Yeah.

16:48.787 --> 16:50.755
It's a file
that was sent to Vincent

16:50.822 --> 16:51.724
at the time of the murder.
We're hoping they're connected.

16:51.725 --> 16:52.992
Oh, what's Vincent gotten
himself into now?

16:53.060 --> 16:54.793
Not to be nitpicky,

16:54.861 --> 16:57.162
but whoever it is got into him.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.529
All right, good news.

16:58.597 --> 16:59.631
The security camera

16:59.698 --> 17:01.166
in the garage was adjusted,

17:01.234 --> 17:03.202
so we don't have to
worry about exposure,

17:03.203 --> 17:05.069
but the I.P. address
is a dead end.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.672
Well, do the names
Larchman, Gaudet

17:06.740 --> 17:08.339
and Thorncliff
mean anything to anyone?

17:08.409 --> 17:09.474
Sounds like a law firm.

17:09.542 --> 17:10.976
Uh, then it says,

17:11.044 --> 17:12.911
"Friday at 5:00."
So, what...

17:12.978 --> 17:14.613
he's got an appointment
with an attorney?

17:14.680 --> 17:15.980
He does have plenty to sue over.

17:16.048 --> 17:17.816
No, they're art galleries.

17:17.884 --> 17:19.349
Art galleries?

17:19.419 --> 17:21.286
Okay, I'm sorry, I know

17:21.353 --> 17:23.422
you want to figure out what's
going on with your boyfriend,

17:23.489 --> 17:25.857
but just tell me what this has
to do with Tucker's murder?

17:25.925 --> 17:27.458
Tess, he was killed by a beast.

17:27.526 --> 17:29.660
We know Vincent has tracked
a beast in the past.

17:29.728 --> 17:31.695
So you think he's
following this new one?

17:31.763 --> 17:33.931
I think someone sent him
to track him.

17:33.998 --> 17:35.966
Maybe I can find out
what Vincent knows on our date.

17:36.034 --> 17:36.700
You have a date
with him, after...?

17:36.768 --> 17:38.168
It's not a real date.

17:38.236 --> 17:39.470
I wasn't planning
on it happening.

17:39.538 --> 17:40.471
but we can use it

17:40.539 --> 17:41.605
as part of our investigation.

17:41.673 --> 17:42.606
Right, a "don't ask,

17:42.674 --> 17:44.641
don't tell" investigation.

17:44.708 --> 17:45.875
In the meantime,

17:45.943 --> 17:46.943
why don't we investigate

17:47.010 --> 17:48.445
our victim?

17:48.512 --> 17:50.379
Well, right now I have
a date with my sister.

17:50.448 --> 17:52.214
And that is real.

18:01.190 --> 18:03.459
Hello?

18:03.526 --> 18:07.128
It's you. Uh, Condor.

18:07.196 --> 18:08.897
Tucker's dead,
who else would it be?

18:08.965 --> 18:13.034
His killer, he called me
from the crime scene.

18:13.102 --> 18:14.670
He was there, waiting for me.

18:14.737 --> 18:15.871
You have a description?

18:15.939 --> 18:18.974
Uh, barely, he's fast.

18:19.041 --> 18:20.541
And British.

18:20.609 --> 18:23.478
It is Sebastian.

18:23.545 --> 18:25.847
NYPD is investigating Tucker.

18:25.914 --> 18:28.149
I just learned they're also
looking into art galleries,

18:28.217 --> 18:30.251
all of which are owned
by Nigel Clifton.

18:30.319 --> 18:33.387
What they don't know is
that Clifton's son

18:33.455 --> 18:34.989
Sebastian was
a Muirfield project

18:35.056 --> 18:36.890
who escaped
when we exterminated Muirfield.

18:36.958 --> 18:38.993
So is that
why he's on your list?

18:39.060 --> 18:41.161
You put two and two together?

18:41.229 --> 18:43.063
Because that's
what we're doing here, right?

18:43.131 --> 18:45.565
You've got a list of names.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.067
Tucker's job was to locate them.

18:47.135 --> 18:49.502
And then I eliminate them,
one by one.

18:49.569 --> 18:52.405
Just trying to keep
people safe, remember?

18:52.473 --> 18:54.573
Is that why I'm
on the list too, sir?

18:54.641 --> 18:56.175
Who told you that? Sebastian?

18:56.243 --> 18:58.011
He's just trying
to throw you off.

18:58.078 --> 18:59.445
Okay, why should I believe you?

18:59.513 --> 19:01.047
Because if I betray you,

19:01.115 --> 19:02.415
you could kill me in seconds.

19:02.483 --> 19:04.682
Now, Vincent...

19:04.750 --> 19:06.718
you've got to trust me.

19:06.785 --> 19:08.186
You are not on the list.

19:08.254 --> 19:10.422
But Sebastian is
and we've got to stop him

19:10.490 --> 19:12.224
before he kills again.

19:12.291 --> 19:15.027
So, what happens Friday at 5:00?

19:15.094 --> 19:18.796
Unclear, sir.

19:18.864 --> 19:20.631
Look, you said
Sebastian's father

19:20.698 --> 19:22.233
owned art galleries, right?

19:22.300 --> 19:23.700
I think they were listed

19:23.768 --> 19:25.536
on the file
that Tucker sent through.

19:25.603 --> 19:27.438
I-I guess that's how he trailed
them all the way there.

19:27.506 --> 19:31.108
Well, wait, why would
the NYPD know this?

19:31.176 --> 19:33.277
There was no cell phone
at the crime scene.

19:33.345 --> 19:36.579
Vincent, I'm not the one
you need to be worried about.

19:36.647 --> 19:38.814
I think we've had
a security breach.

19:38.882 --> 19:41.384
Not on my end, sir,
I would know.

19:41.452 --> 19:42.985
Are you sure?

19:53.696 --> 19:57.433
♪ Opened the gate
to welcome my fall ♪

19:57.500 --> 19:58.600
♪ Right down to the bait...

19:58.668 --> 19:59.668
Don't worry about it.

19:59.735 --> 20:01.336
I got here early.
Clearly.

20:01.404 --> 20:02.438
That is a long list of pros.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.805
They're just things

20:03.873 --> 20:05.407
like weather, I mean,

20:05.475 --> 20:06.675
you can't make
life decisions based on them.

20:06.742 --> 20:08.576
Talk to everyone in California.

20:08.643 --> 20:11.145
Yeah, but California doesn't
have humidity. Another con.

20:11.213 --> 20:13.247
So, it's just...
me and humidity?

20:13.315 --> 20:14.815
Well, it's better
you're a con than a pro.

20:14.883 --> 20:17.085
It means I actually
like being around you.

20:17.152 --> 20:20.455
Um, if this is something
that you really want...

20:20.522 --> 20:24.691
I know that we've been through
a lot, you know, losing Dad,

20:24.758 --> 20:27.160
but you're
not gonna lose me, too.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.596
I think that's
what I'm afraid of.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.598
Okay, then I will buy
five round-trip tickets

20:31.665 --> 20:34.101
to Florida right now,
if that makes you feel better.

20:34.168 --> 20:37.437
No, it's, um, it's not
just about the distance.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.871
Um...

20:40.407 --> 20:41.340
You know how I've been trying

20:41.408 --> 20:42.808
to tell you something

20:42.875 --> 20:45.043
for a while but you've
just been so busy?

20:45.112 --> 20:47.779
Um, it's-it's about Dad.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.516
When he had his accident.

20:50.584 --> 20:51.883
Uh, we both gave blood.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.652
Um...

20:56.089 --> 20:59.224
...yours wasn't a match.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.127
What?

21:02.194 --> 21:05.062
I mean, he's still your father,
obviously, he raised you...

21:05.131 --> 21:06.564
Wait, wait, wait.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.869
So, you're telling me

21:11.937 --> 21:14.371
that biologically

21:14.439 --> 21:17.040
Dad and I aren't...

21:17.108 --> 21:18.509
Or maybe they got it wrong.

21:18.576 --> 21:20.336
I mean, hospitals make mistakes
all the time.

21:20.378 --> 21:21.311
Hospitals?

21:21.379 --> 21:22.746
So, they told you this?

21:22.813 --> 21:25.349
Heather, that was
three months ago.

21:25.416 --> 21:29.018
Yes, yes,
I-I should've told you...

21:29.085 --> 21:30.725
You've kept this from me
this entire time?

21:30.787 --> 21:31.720
It's just, we've been

21:31.788 --> 21:32.921
like ships in the night...

21:32.989 --> 21:34.323
It doesn't take
very long to say,

21:34.391 --> 21:36.192
"Dad is not your dad."

21:36.260 --> 21:38.060
I'm not defending it,
I'm just saying,

21:38.128 --> 21:40.369
it's not exactly something you
blurt out over voice mail.

21:40.397 --> 21:42.532
I was waiting
for the perfect moment, okay?

21:42.599 --> 21:44.432
And-and you weren't
in the right headspace.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.767
Okay, so this is my fault?

21:45.834 --> 21:48.503
It's not either
of our faults, Cat.

21:48.571 --> 21:50.071
We just lost our dad.

21:50.139 --> 21:51.773
Your dad.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.708
I didn't want
to pile this on you.

21:53.776 --> 21:54.942
And he was your dad.

21:55.010 --> 21:56.211
Just like you're
still my sister.

21:56.279 --> 21:57.445
So if you think
about it,

21:57.513 --> 21:59.013
this really doesn't
affect anything.

21:59.081 --> 22:02.015
Well, I am feeling pretty
affected right now.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.250
I'm sorry.

22:03.318 --> 22:05.419
Heather,
go to Miami.

22:16.497 --> 22:17.763
Oh, my God.

22:17.831 --> 22:19.699
Did I get the time
wrong, or...?

22:19.766 --> 22:22.368
No, no, I just...

22:22.436 --> 22:24.136
I've had a really
intense day,

22:24.204 --> 22:25.705
and I-I needed
to walk it off.

22:25.772 --> 22:27.272
Work?

22:27.340 --> 22:29.274
I wish.

22:31.845 --> 22:32.912
These are beautiful.

22:35.281 --> 22:37.049
You know, we, uh...

22:37.117 --> 22:38.438
never really talk
about your work.

22:38.451 --> 22:41.452
Well, we probably
shouldn't start now.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.321
If whatever it was
crossed over

22:43.388 --> 22:45.256
with what
you're doing...

22:45.324 --> 22:46.991
I mean, that's what
we said, right? No questions?

22:47.059 --> 22:48.960
Right, just stick
to current events

22:49.028 --> 22:50.762
and the weather.
We could always talk about

22:50.830 --> 22:52.097
what you want
to do tonight.

22:52.164 --> 22:53.331
Are you hungry?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.135
Not really.
Yeah, but let me ask you,

22:58.203 --> 23:00.337
uh, what case are you
working on right now?

23:01.472 --> 23:03.573
A homicide.

23:03.641 --> 23:05.442
I don't think that we should...
Who?

23:05.509 --> 23:07.477
Vincent, if you're
sensing something,

23:07.545 --> 23:09.446
I just found out
my dad's not my dad,

23:09.513 --> 23:11.914
and my sister's known
for three months

23:11.982 --> 23:13.462
and it's just a lot
for me to process.

23:18.421 --> 23:19.655
You know what?

23:19.723 --> 23:21.357
Let's just take
a rain check.

23:21.424 --> 23:23.092
Vincent, wait.

23:39.242 --> 23:41.209
The door was unlocked.

23:45.046 --> 23:48.048
<i>I just came to talk</i>
<i>about our relationship.</i>

23:50.051 --> 23:51.786
<i>Well, we can just stick to</i>

23:51.853 --> 23:54.288
<i>current events and weather.</i>

23:56.091 --> 23:57.691
<i>You can't do that again.</i>

24:00.094 --> 24:02.061
You just can't
cross that line.

24:16.421 --> 24:17.154
Hey.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.321
Hey.

24:18.389 --> 24:19.589
I actually think
your undercover idea

24:19.657 --> 24:20.723
is a good one.

24:20.791 --> 24:22.026
No.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.894
I think he busted me.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.829
He knows that I was there
investigating him.

24:25.897 --> 24:26.830
What happened?

24:28.533 --> 24:31.234
Oh, I had this terrible
conversation with Heather

24:31.302 --> 24:33.903
and I, uh...
forgot I was undercover.

24:33.971 --> 24:36.072
You should have seen his face

24:36.140 --> 24:38.341
when he realized
I was lying to him.

24:38.409 --> 24:40.243
He thought I was giving him
a second chance.

24:40.311 --> 24:42.512
Look, I know you
were doing this

24:42.580 --> 24:43.980
to get back
with your boyfriend.

24:44.048 --> 24:45.848
Well, you might've,
but I didn't.

24:45.916 --> 24:47.876
I know you thought you were
protecting the public.

24:47.884 --> 24:49.985
Well, the good news is, you are.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.321
Those art galleries
on Vincent's computer?

24:52.389 --> 24:54.690
I traced
Agent Tucker's DOT card.

24:54.757 --> 24:56.758
He parked near
every one of them.

24:56.826 --> 24:58.160
He must've been
tracking the same beast

24:58.228 --> 24:59.595
at the galleries.

24:59.663 --> 25:01.530
Does that mean the FBI knows?

25:01.598 --> 25:02.830
I don't think so, or Tucker
would've had a tranq on him.

25:02.898 --> 25:04.199
You know, he probably thought

25:04.266 --> 25:05.933
he was tracking
an art thief or something.

25:06.001 --> 25:08.536
Point is, Vincent's
probably after him.

25:08.604 --> 25:09.870
You need to go back undercover,

25:09.938 --> 25:12.307
That's what we do.

25:14.343 --> 25:16.777
That's my other line,
I'll call you back.

25:16.845 --> 25:18.646
Chandler.

25:18.714 --> 25:21.115
Hey, it's me.

25:21.183 --> 25:22.482
Hi.

25:22.550 --> 25:24.018
Hi. Look, um...

25:24.086 --> 25:25.352
I didn't mean to run out

25:25.420 --> 25:27.021
like that before.
I was just, um...

25:27.089 --> 25:29.857
I was just, uh, so overwhelmed.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.892
I know, um...

25:31.960 --> 25:33.160
I had a memory.

25:33.228 --> 25:34.461
What?

25:34.529 --> 25:36.796
Yeah, uh...

25:36.864 --> 25:39.833
were you and I ever at a...
like, a swimming pool?

25:39.900 --> 25:42.235
What are you talking about?

25:42.302 --> 25:45.038
Well, were we ever in a,
um, you know, like a pool?

25:45.106 --> 25:46.305
Like a hotel pool?

25:46.373 --> 25:48.708
Yeah.

25:48.776 --> 25:50.976
You just had this memory
in my hallway?

25:51.044 --> 25:53.511
Yeah, I mean,
I can't explain it.

25:53.579 --> 25:55.647
I just had this memory of us

25:55.715 --> 25:58.416
buying bathing suits
at some gift shop.

26:00.453 --> 26:01.653
Oh, my God, Vincent.

26:01.721 --> 26:02.654
I know.

26:02.722 --> 26:04.156
It's crazy, right?

26:04.224 --> 26:05.523
So, uh, I was thinking

26:05.591 --> 26:06.924
we could go back there,
you know?

26:06.992 --> 26:10.194
Maybe it might trigger
more memories.

26:12.931 --> 26:14.665
Yeah.

26:14.733 --> 26:16.267
Yes, of course.

26:16.334 --> 26:19.670
Okay, well, I'm...
I'm free in an hour.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.940
Wait, you want to go right now?

26:24.008 --> 26:26.176
Yeah, why not?

26:26.244 --> 26:29.045
And bring your bathing suit,
we're going swimming.

26:29.113 --> 26:31.948
'Cause that's what
we did before, right?

26:34.652 --> 26:35.852
Yeah.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.087
Um, I'll see you soon.

26:37.155 --> 26:38.421
Yeah, okay.

26:44.961 --> 26:46.262
Hello?

26:46.329 --> 26:47.729
JT, you said you gave Vincent

26:47.798 --> 26:49.965
a Cliffs Notes version
of our relationship.

26:50.033 --> 26:51.867
Did that include a hotel pool?

26:51.935 --> 26:53.235
Yeah, why?

26:53.303 --> 26:54.469
Was I not supposed
to tell him about that?

26:54.537 --> 26:56.304
No, he just pretended
to remember it.

26:56.371 --> 26:57.438
What?

26:57.506 --> 26:58.439
Yeah.

26:58.507 --> 26:59.874
But why would he do that?

26:59.942 --> 27:01.876
Because he realized
I was investigating him

27:01.944 --> 27:03.377
and he's trying to
throw me off his trail

27:03.445 --> 27:05.046
by sending me
to a hotel pool.

27:05.114 --> 27:07.548
Maybe he just wants to see
you in a bathing suit.

27:07.616 --> 27:09.717
No, JT.

27:09.785 --> 27:10.985

<i>Friday at Five</i>
isn't a time, it's a painting.

27:29.970 --> 27:31.603
Nigel Clifton, the owner
of all those galleries,

27:31.671 --> 27:33.739
is auctioning it off tonight
here at his penthouse.

27:33.807 --> 27:35.367
Says here this is
<i>Time Out New York's</i>

27:35.392 --> 27:36.876
event of the week.

27:36.877 --> 27:38.144
Clifton commissioned it

27:38.212 --> 27:39.445
in honor of his only son,
Sebastian.

27:39.512 --> 27:41.314
Wait, so this
really is about art?

27:41.381 --> 27:43.681
I think it's
about the son.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.116
He was British Armed Forces,
KIA'd in Afghanistan.

27:45.184 --> 27:46.318
Which is the same
thing you'll find

27:46.385 --> 27:47.418
if you do a search
on Vincent.

27:47.486 --> 27:48.786
So you think
Sebastian's

27:48.855 --> 27:50.588
another one of
Muirfield's experiments?

27:50.656 --> 27:52.457
And probably the one
that killed Agent Tucker.

27:52.491 --> 27:53.959
And I will bet anything

27:54.026 --> 27:55.426
that Vincent's here
looking for him, too.

27:55.494 --> 27:57.428
And faked that memory

27:57.496 --> 27:58.996
to throw me off his trail.

27:59.064 --> 28:00.664
What are we going to do
if a beast brawl breaks out?

28:00.732 --> 28:02.466
Improvise?
No, we're going to stop it

28:02.533 --> 28:04.201
before it happens.
How?

28:04.269 --> 28:06.110
Did you figure out what
Sebastian's doing here?

28:06.171 --> 28:07.771
No, but there's gotta be
a reason that tonight's the night

28:07.839 --> 28:09.606
Vincent's been
sent after him.

28:09.674 --> 28:11.211
So, let me guess:
we're backup,

28:11.212 --> 28:12.761
and you're going on
a "date" with him?

28:12.786 --> 28:14.211
He wishes.

28:14.212 --> 28:15.811

I know,
no questions, but...

28:43.273 --> 28:45.540
Catherine...
Maybe over a dance?

28:45.608 --> 28:46.875
I can't.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.242
Yes, you can.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.144
You danced at
my dad's wedding...

28:50.212 --> 28:53.381
but you'll probably pretend
to remember that, too.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.085
Come on, this is
gonna be fun.

29:00.225 --> 29:01.456
What are you looking for?

29:01.457 --> 29:04.593
And I'm not talking
about art or women.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.594
Okay. This is
a bad idea.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.395
Right, we're supposed
to stick to

29:08.463 --> 29:10.731
current events
and the weather.

29:10.799 --> 29:12.332
Well, it's warm
in here,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.034
and currently,

29:14.102 --> 29:17.337
I think you're
looking for Sebastian.

my computer.

29:28.148 --> 29:29.582
You asked about my work.

29:29.650 --> 29:30.850
This is my case.

29:30.918 --> 29:32.251
And this is the nicest

29:32.319 --> 29:34.286
interrogation room
I've ever been in.

29:34.354 --> 29:36.255
So that's what this "dance" is?

29:36.323 --> 29:37.523
What are you gonna do,
lose control

29:37.590 --> 29:39.124
in front of
all these people?

29:39.191 --> 29:41.560
I wouldn't
recommend it,

29:41.628 --> 29:43.896
especially because this
time I brought backup,

29:43.963 --> 29:45.363
and they have tranqs.

29:51.938 --> 29:54.371

what's going on.

an allergic reaction.

30:13.057 --> 30:15.124
Maybe if you can find out
more about that painting,

30:15.192 --> 30:16.927
we'll know what
Sebastian's planning.

30:16.994 --> 30:18.995
I'll stay here and make
sure nothing happens.

30:19.063 --> 30:22.432
Gotcha, boss.

30:22.499 --> 30:24.067
So, what else is
happening here tonight,

30:24.134 --> 30:25.334
besides art being sold?

30:25.402 --> 30:28.971
Is Sebastian here
for a good time?

30:29.039 --> 30:30.906
To, uh, see his dad,

30:30.974 --> 30:33.241
or to put his fist
through someone's chest?

30:33.309 --> 30:34.910
Why would I
tell you anything?

30:34.978 --> 30:36.311
Okay, I lied,
but...

30:36.379 --> 30:37.746
No. You are using me

30:37.814 --> 30:39.949
to try and get information
on your case,

30:40.016 --> 30:43.751
and get... revenge.

30:43.819 --> 30:45.186
Revenge?

30:45.253 --> 30:47.321
Yeah, a lot of that
going around tonight.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.322
Who, Sebastian?

30:48.390 --> 30:49.591
Is that why he's here?

30:49.658 --> 30:50.925
Revenge against whom?

30:50.993 --> 30:52.460
♪ Ba dlu dla dlun dloday

30:56.164 --> 30:58.632

because you hurt me.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.433
Okay.

31:00.501 --> 31:03.804
I wore a scarf all day
to cover up what you did,

31:03.871 --> 31:07.007
telling myself and anyone
who would listen that...

31:07.075 --> 31:09.643
that this wasn't
your fault.

31:09.711 --> 31:11.712
That if I could find
whoever was controlling you,

31:11.779 --> 31:12.980
I could cut
those strings,

31:13.047 --> 31:14.981
and we could be
together again.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.652
I lied because
I care about you.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.321
You lied
for a case.

31:22.388 --> 31:25.024
And the saddest part
about this entire thing

31:25.092 --> 31:27.226
is that no one forced you
to fake that memory,

31:27.293 --> 31:28.694
you did that
all on your own.

31:29.862 --> 31:31.663
Thanks for the dance.

31:34.366 --> 31:35.326
She is spunky.

31:38.203 --> 31:39.470
I'll make her disappear, too.

31:40.572 --> 31:42.507
Make for a better show.

31:44.610 --> 31:46.543
Excuse me.

31:49.580 --> 31:51.020
That's called
<i>Friday at Five.</i>

31:51.049 --> 31:52.716
That was the time of
the week I set aside,

31:52.784 --> 31:54.151
my son
and I would

31:54.218 --> 31:56.654
go to the magic store,
buy a new trick.

31:56.721 --> 31:58.188
So you were close.

31:58.256 --> 31:59.757
Okay, I'm done
saving Vincent,

31:59.824 --> 32:01.025
but it seems that
Sebastian isn't just here

32:01.092 --> 32:02.258
to say hi
to his dad.

32:02.325 --> 32:03.425
So we need
to focus

32:03.493 --> 32:04.861
on keeping these
guests safe.

32:04.928 --> 32:07.396
Okay, my new BFF Nigel
Clifton filled me in.

32:07.464 --> 32:09.431
Apparently, Sebastian
was into magic.

32:09.499 --> 32:11.167
Dad sends him off
to the military,

32:11.234 --> 32:12.568
thinks he's dead.

32:12.636 --> 32:13.836
It'd make for a pretty
good magic show

32:13.904 --> 32:15.538
if he reappeared
during the auction

32:15.605 --> 32:17.839
in front of all these people.
Dad sent him?

32:17.907 --> 32:19.541
Yeah, he's totally
guilt-ridden.

32:19.608 --> 32:20.776
Vincent said something
about revenge.

32:20.843 --> 32:22.044
I thought he was
referring to me,

32:22.111 --> 32:23.378
maybe he was talking
about Sebastian.

32:23.445 --> 32:24.379
So he's here to kill his dad

32:24.446 --> 32:25.947
in front of all these people?

32:26.015 --> 32:27.415
Revenge for what?

32:27.483 --> 32:28.684
Sending him to war.

32:28.751 --> 32:30.085
No, I'm talking
about you.

32:30.153 --> 32:31.452
'Cause that is
not a hickey.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.888
Did Vincent...

32:32.955 --> 32:34.521
Tess...
Okay, can we not do this now?

32:34.589 --> 32:36.223
So you've known
about this, too?

32:36.291 --> 32:38.292
That was the lie
on the polygraph.

32:38.359 --> 32:40.427
Okay, I'm sorry...
And now is not the time.

32:40.495 --> 32:41.628
Right now, we need

32:41.697 --> 32:42.763
to figure out how
to get Clifton

32:42.831 --> 32:44.031
and these people
out of here

32:44.099 --> 32:46.767
before Sebastian's big show.

32:48.036 --> 32:49.803
Excuse me, sir.

32:49.870 --> 32:50.937
You need to come with me.

32:51.005 --> 32:52.138
We have reason to believe

32:52.206 --> 32:53.573
there has been a threat
on your life.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.075
Well, deal with it.

32:55.142 --> 32:57.043
I hired you people to
keep the riffraff out.

32:57.111 --> 32:58.945
I'm about to get up in
front of all these people.

32:59.013 --> 33:00.213
It's for charity.
Yes.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.748
Mr. Clifton, hi.

33:01.816 --> 33:03.817
I think I spilled red wine
on your Jackson Pollack.

33:03.884 --> 33:05.784
I don't have a Pollack.

33:05.852 --> 33:08.587
Oh, that, uh, splotchy painting
in the elevator?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.889
What?

33:10.957 --> 33:12.791
My backup are evacuating
the guests.

33:12.859 --> 33:14.099
You need to hold off Sebastian.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.460
There's a gas leak.

33:15.528 --> 33:16.895
We've been asked
to evacuate the building.

33:16.963 --> 33:18.363
We need everyone
to take the stairs.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.433
Enjoying the party?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.168
I was until you
and your girlfriend

33:24.236 --> 33:26.403
ruined the show.

33:31.744 --> 33:32.744
I don't see anything.

33:32.811 --> 33:33.811
Oh.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.113
Did I say red wine?

33:35.180 --> 33:36.748
I meant white.
It's not like a couch.

33:36.815 --> 33:37.914
You can't just throw
soda water on it

33:37.982 --> 33:39.816
and make it go away.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.044
Lady, I didn't get where I am

33:41.085 --> 33:42.185
from being an idiot.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.419
What's going on?

33:43.487 --> 33:46.656
There is a threat on your life.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.496
I warned you.

33:54.564 --> 33:56.465
I crossed you off that list.

34:04.241 --> 34:06.642
Yeah, there's no reception.

34:06.709 --> 34:09.210
I'm sure this is nothing to do
with the threat.

34:09.279 --> 34:11.239
What kind of threat
are we speaking about exactly?

34:11.246 --> 34:12.847
What was that?

34:16.051 --> 34:17.118
Hi, Sebastian.

34:17.186 --> 34:18.518
I thought I had daddy issues.

34:54.454 --> 34:56.188
Vincent!

35:19.726 --> 35:22.176
Heathe.

35:22.177 --> 35:23.876
I'm not gonna take the job.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.908
Oh, my God.

35:25.976 --> 35:27.343
No, listen.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.245
I...

35:29.312 --> 35:30.913
I can't leave knowing that
I've damaged our relationship.

35:30.981 --> 35:33.015
I mean, you're the only family

35:33.083 --> 35:34.816
I have,
and I will do anything...

35:34.885 --> 35:36.051
I'm a hypocrite.

35:36.119 --> 35:37.519
I made you feel bad

35:37.587 --> 35:39.188
for not telling me,
for not being honest,

35:39.221 --> 35:42.390
but you know what I spent
my morning doing?

35:42.457 --> 35:45.493
Learning how to cheat
a polygraph.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.560
You can do that?

35:46.628 --> 35:47.695
Yes. The point is,

35:47.763 --> 35:50.865
you had your reasons

35:50.933 --> 35:52.666
for doing what you did,

35:52.734 --> 35:55.002
and I have been impossible
to pin down.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.870
No, I-I still should have
come clean.

35:56.938 --> 35:58.071
Isn't that what Dad
should have done?

35:58.139 --> 35:59.907
Maybe he didn't know.
You're right.

35:59.974 --> 36:01.674
Maybe Mom's the liar or both.
Who knows?

36:03.644 --> 36:06.780
But you're right.

36:06.847 --> 36:08.916
This doesn't change us.

36:10.517 --> 36:13.886
You're still my sister.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.888
That's the thing, though,

36:15.956 --> 36:17.924
I just... I don't know.

36:17.991 --> 36:19.959
I haven't really felt like it.

36:20.027 --> 36:22.395
I've been avoiding you

36:22.462 --> 36:23.930
because carrying this around

36:23.997 --> 36:26.431
and-and being dishonest with you
has felt horrible.

36:28.367 --> 36:29.734
Lying to someone,

36:29.802 --> 36:31.403
it changes everything.

36:31.470 --> 36:32.637
I may have had my reasons,

36:32.704 --> 36:34.372
but it wasn't worth it.

36:36.042 --> 36:37.809
Are you sure that you're not
my big sister?

36:39.678 --> 36:41.379
And our parents didn't fudge
our birth order, too.

36:45.116 --> 36:46.951
Take this job.

36:47.018 --> 36:48.819
But you weren't just
on the con list

36:48.886 --> 36:50.620
because I hadn't told you yet.

36:50.688 --> 36:52.289
You were...

36:52.357 --> 36:54.258
You were on it
because I miss you already.

36:55.893 --> 36:57.428
I've missed you
for three months.

37:00.664 --> 37:02.665
The truth is

37:02.732 --> 37:04.633
I've missed you for longer,

37:04.701 --> 37:06.102
but...

37:06.170 --> 37:07.803
I can't be the con

37:07.871 --> 37:10.139
that keeps you
from taking this job.

37:12.309 --> 37:14.009
And your hair can handle
the humidity.

37:14.077 --> 37:15.677
Well, so can yours, okay?

37:15.744 --> 37:18.447
You're totally buying
those round-trip tickets.

37:18.514 --> 37:20.449
Come here.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.154
How's your BFF Clifton?

37:26.222 --> 37:29.157
Oh, drowsy and completely
unaware of beasts

37:29.225 --> 37:32.759
or any dead sons coming back
to haunt him. How are the feds?

37:32.827 --> 37:35.329
Blamed Agent Tucker's murder
on Sebastian.

37:35.397 --> 37:37.598
Off-the-grid vet,
mistakenly declared

37:37.665 --> 37:40.434
K.I.A., struggling
with severe PTSD.

37:40.502 --> 37:42.503
I suggested we not release
the information wide,

37:42.570 --> 37:45.339
let Clifton Senior think his son
died a war hero.

37:45.407 --> 37:48.674
Agent Reynolds was
surprisingly supportive.

37:48.742 --> 37:50.977
Oh, the polygraph, thanks.

37:51.045 --> 37:52.945
I wasn't sure
where that was supposed to go.

37:54.048 --> 37:55.715
Hey, give me your hands.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.218
Why?

38:00.687 --> 38:03.022
What are you doing?

38:03.089 --> 38:04.890
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

38:04.957 --> 38:06.892
Tess, is this
about the hickey?

38:06.959 --> 38:09.528
Because... I'm not hiding
anything else.

38:09.595 --> 38:11.296
Oh, I think you are.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.565
You protected her secret
for a reason.

38:13.633 --> 38:15.353
Because she didn't want
to hear it from you.

38:15.402 --> 38:17.369
Or because you have a crush
on her.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.138
Good night, Tess.

38:20.205 --> 38:21.406
You realize your refusing
to take

38:21.473 --> 38:22.573
a polygraph
makes you look

38:22.641 --> 38:23.874
highly suspicious.

38:23.942 --> 38:25.376
And you realize

38:25.444 --> 38:26.577
you sound
like you're in middle school

38:26.645 --> 38:27.811
and you're
acting out

38:27.879 --> 38:29.213
because she didn't tell you.

38:49.400 --> 38:55.538
♪ You come around
and make the seasons change ♪

38:57.140 --> 39:00.676
♪ You come around
and leave the way... ♪

39:00.743 --> 39:03.112
Did JT tell you
about the fire escape, too?

39:03.180 --> 39:04.680
I remembered it.

39:04.747 --> 39:06.448
Vincent, please don't do this
right now.

39:06.515 --> 39:08.783
And I also remember grabbing you
out of the way

39:08.850 --> 39:09.784
of an oncoming train.

39:09.851 --> 39:11.619
And another time

39:11.687 --> 39:14.755
we were in the woods
and you had braids

39:14.823 --> 39:16.191
and it was so cold
I could see

39:16.258 --> 39:17.592
your breath.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.961
Look, I know
they're just

39:20.028 --> 39:21.796
flashes, but...

39:21.863 --> 39:24.631
I do, Catherine, I remember you.

39:24.699 --> 39:26.200
And I'm not

39:26.267 --> 39:27.867
borrowing from JT
this time, okay?

39:27.935 --> 39:29.103
You can ask him.

39:32.207 --> 39:34.975
Even if it is the truth...

39:35.042 --> 39:37.978
It is.

39:38.045 --> 39:40.779
I'm sorry for pretending.

39:40.847 --> 39:42.648
But I couldn't
trust you

39:42.716 --> 39:45.084
because I didn't remember you.

39:45.152 --> 39:47.320
But now...
There are so many more lies

39:47.387 --> 39:50.889
in our relationship
than just one pretend memory.

39:52.493 --> 39:56.261
There are so many things
I can't ask you.

39:56.329 --> 39:59.164
What do you do?

39:59.232 --> 40:01.666
Who do you work for?

40:04.737 --> 40:06.738
Exactly.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.274
And it isn't
just you

40:09.342 --> 40:11.108
who's lying. I...

40:11.176 --> 40:14.278
I put antiperspirant on
my forehead so that I could...

40:14.346 --> 40:15.912
find out what's going on
in your life.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.315
You were just trying
to help me out, okay?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.784
And I didn't realize that back
then, but I can see it now.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.789
Catherine, after everything
that you have been through,

40:25.857 --> 40:27.590
I am not gonna push you away
anymore.

40:31.728 --> 40:36.266
Maybe it's because my parents
lied so much, I just...

40:36.333 --> 40:38.934
I've reached
my lifetime capacity for it.

40:39.002 --> 40:41.471
This isn't gonna be forever,
okay?

40:41.539 --> 40:43.038
It's too late.

40:43.105 --> 40:44.139
Heather's right.

40:44.207 --> 40:46.475
You lie once and-and...

40:46.543 --> 40:48.477
and it changes everything.

40:48.545 --> 40:51.613
That relationship that
you're remembering?

40:51.681 --> 40:54.783
We never lied to each other.

40:59.054 --> 41:00.821
I just can't...

41:00.889 --> 41:03.658
I can't handle it.

41:03.725 --> 41:06.994
I can't live with any more lies.

41:07.062 --> 41:09.163
It's too hard.
