03:36.090 --> 03:41.246
Little Ricky, where are you baby?
Come on, honey. It's dinner time.

03:41.346 --> 03:45.474
It's your favorite flavor. Liver buffet.
Where are you?

03:47.936 --> 03:53.190
There you are.
Hey, what're you doing under there?

03:54.651 --> 03:58.946
What you doing under there?
What's the matter?

04:01.616 --> 04:06.912
Ricky, baby,
what's the matter sweetheart?

04:29.560 --> 04:32.354
They're ready for you, Doctor.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.970
- How is she?
- Still in the OR.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.930
We haven't heard anything yet.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.473
When did this happen?

04:42.573 --> 04:46.186
He was waiting for her at her place
when she got home from class.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.606
Forensics says it was the same man
who raped Cara Latham.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.275
Did you really need a forensics expert
to tell you that?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.402
- Andy.
- Dana, when was the last time

04:54.502 --> 04:57.530
I asked your department to beef up
the security and cameras, right?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.783
I mean not the first four times.
Just the last time.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.785
Don't get pissy with me, Professor.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.330
I don't have the manpower
to break up a frat party.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.789
- Suction.
- Suction.

05:06.889 --> 05:07.957
What's that pressure?

05:08.057 --> 05:11.044
We're under 70. Sixty-nine.
She's sliding down pretty fast.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.380
- We're gonna lose her, Doctor.
- I would not bet my ranch on that.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.633
David, drop 0.2 CCs of epinephrine.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.260
- Tanya, give me the stitch please.
- 3-0 silk.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.361
We're down at 63. Epinephrine, Doctor?

05:21.779 --> 05:23.196
No, not yet.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.035
Sixty.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.954
Still think it's a Phenobarb reaction?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.001
Epinephrine.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.948
In.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.033
All right.
Ease up on that retraction pressure.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.300
Sixty-five and going up.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.594
Don't worry about that.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.346
- 68.
- I don't believe it.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.917
- 72.
- How about some scissors?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.726
- Metzenbaum.
- Beautiful.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.271
80. She's out of the woods.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.219
- Way to practice medicine. Irrigation please.
- Irrigation.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.304
Dr. Robertson,
would you please close for me?

06:03.404 --> 06:05.280
- You got it.
- Nice going, people.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.409
By the way, everybody,

06:10.870 --> 06:12.913
it's great to be in Saint Agnes.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.711
That was good work.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.868
- Dr. Robertson... May I call you Matthew?
- Of course.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.386
Matthew,

06:28.471 --> 06:32.292
I'm the new guy around here
and I want to make friends,

06:32.392 --> 06:35.560
so I'll say this to you
and we'll start fresh.

06:38.439 --> 06:42.468
If you don't like my jokes, don't laugh.

06:42.568 --> 06:47.598
If you have a medical opinion,
please speak up and speak up loud.

06:47.698 --> 06:52.603
But if you ever again tell me or my surgical
staff that we're going to lose a patient,

06:52.703 --> 06:56.456
I'm going to take out your lungs
with a fucking ice-cream scoop.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.252
Do you understand me?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.171
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

07:04.340 --> 07:07.676
Don't be ridiculous. Everybody likes me.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.255
- Dr. Hill.
- Yeah.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.383
I'm Andy Safian.
I'm Associate Dean at the college

07:22.483 --> 07:25.970
and I wondered if you could tell me
anything about Bridget Kelly's condition.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.906
Well, she has a badly contused liver,
but I think she's gonna be just fine.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.535
Great. Thanks to you.

07:33.953 --> 07:38.039
Well, come to the midnight show,
I levitate the next of kin.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.919
It's Jed Hill, right?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.379
Yeah.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.214
"Galloping" Jed Hill?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.217
Excuse me.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.052
We were at the high school together.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.791
You're kidding me.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.710
- You went to Van Buren?
- Yeah.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.253
How long you've been in Westerly?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.382
Well, I've been here about nine hours now.
Van Buren, huh?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.677
Yeah, well, we weren't in the same...
We didn't travel in the same circles but...

08:06.777 --> 08:11.072
- Did I give you a hard time?
- No, you didn't know who the hell I was.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.742
Dr. Hill.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.745
Hi, Tanya.

08:17.413 --> 08:21.082
I just wanted to say congratulations.
We're all very happy that you're here.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.836
Well, thank you. It's nice to be here.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.801
Looks like you're big man
on campus again.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.724
- I hope to see you around.
- Yeah, me, too.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.733
That's wonderful, Michelle.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.862
Hey, why don't we try painting
on the paper not on your arm?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.742
- I am a boogeyman.
- Teacher, teacher!

08:56.953 --> 08:59.772
Hey, Jason, don't you ever, ever play
with plastic bags

08:59.872 --> 09:02.874
or I'll tie you up and I'll feed you
to little cape monster. You got it?

09:11.175 --> 09:14.245
Hi. I heard what happened.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.497
Can you go on lunch now?

09:16.597 --> 09:18.265
Give me a minute.

09:23.646 --> 09:28.050
Yeah, the guy got in
when she was out at her class.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.219
- She's gonna be all right?
- Looks like it.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.472
Turns out that your hospital
has a new surgeon,

09:32.572 --> 09:36.058
this whiz kid from Mass General
who did a great job.

09:36.158 --> 09:41.454
So I went back to introduce myself,
to thank him and are you ready for this?

09:42.123 --> 09:44.874
- We went to high school together.
- Oh, no kidding.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.281
- Speak of the devil...
- And the devil appears.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.618
I was just recounting
all your exploits here.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.886
This is my wife, Tracy.
Tracy, this is Dr. Jed Hill.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.180
Any high school friend of Andy's...

09:59.557 --> 10:02.376
- This is Dr. Sullivan, Alan and Tracy Safian.
- Andy.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.129
Andy. Andy works at the college.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.673
- He's associate dean of students.
- Fantastic.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.259
I don't leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.803
- But we are very proud of him.
- That's well. You should be.

10:12.903 --> 10:16.224
Listen, we're having a small reception
to welcome Jed to Saint Agnes.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.558
Why don't you come along?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.393
We'd love to,
but we have a lunch appointment.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.187
Maybe some other time.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.579
Definitely.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.458
- Nice meeting you, Tracy.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.617
Well, we got the estimate
from the plumber this morning.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.925
And?

10:36.594 --> 10:39.580
- Are you ready for this?
- How much?

10:39.680 --> 10:43.209
It's 13,000 and change.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.586
How much change?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.421
It's 14,000.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.924
All right, forget it.
I'm gonna do the work myself.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.717
- I got a better idea.
- No.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.427
Well, just for a little while.
It'll pay some bills.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.096
We rent it to
some visiting lecturer or something.

10:55.196 --> 10:59.392
I don't want to rent out the third floor.
I don't want a stranger in our house.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.852
All right, suit yourself.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.815
Would've been nice living in a home
with running water but...

11:05.915 --> 11:07.749
I'm a simple girl.

11:10.252 --> 11:13.364
- Hey, I'm gonna pick you up after work.
- No, it's okay.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.576
Forget it. I'm gonna pick you up.
There's a maniac loose in this town.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.244
Helen can give me a ride.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.762
- She can? Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yes.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.060
Make sure she waits
until you're inside the house.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.605
I'll have her provide air coverage
if you want.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.779
It's funny. I married a funny woman.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.306
- See you.
- Goodnight. See you.

12:25.494 --> 12:29.190
You know in street clothes,
Helen looks positively masculine.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.566
What?

12:30.666 --> 12:34.335
Helen. You said you were
getting a ride home from Helen.

12:35.504 --> 12:39.174
- Were you spying on me?
- No, no. I was just looking out my window.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.661
Then you were looking
at Dennis Riley, Andy.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.012
He was my mother's lawyer.
He had papers for me to sign.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.723
What kind of papers?

12:47.808 --> 12:50.169
Something about my mother's estate.
What is this?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.213
- Your mother's estate?
- Yes.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.216
You told me she barely got by
on a social security check.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.927
And now she's Lady Astor?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.360
Come on, Andy.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.265
There was a small account.
It handled the cemetery arrangements.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.351
The money's run out.
Dennis wanted to talk to me about.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.036
Now what is it you want
to talk to me about?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.205
Sorry.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.213
Hey, listen, would you think
any less of me if I used a fork?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.950
I'm beginning to lose my strength here.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.051
I can't let that happen.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.220
Lie back. Give it to me.

13:26.305 --> 13:30.850
Lie back. That's right.
All the way back.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.895
- Technique, huh?
- The expert.

13:35.064 --> 13:39.734
It's all in my hands, see?
Open. Open up.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.238
Good boy. Delicious, huh?

13:45.950 --> 13:46.950
Open.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.066
That's good. More.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.584
Look, I think your strength
is returning.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.213
It's a miracle.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.947
Andy.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.493
- What?
- He's there again.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.037
So?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.775
He's looking at us.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.237
Sounds like he's playing
one of those electric keyboards.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.782
Jesus, it gives me the creeps.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.509
Be nice. His mother works at night.
I think she's a night nurse.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.846
He's probably lonely.

14:56.770 --> 15:01.608
We gotta get some curtains up in here.
It's a priority.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.305
Curtains are now the priority.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.990
Not until we decide what to paint.

15:09.992 --> 15:14.913
There is no point in painting if we are
gonna rip up the floors with the plumbing.

15:16.165 --> 15:20.168
So, really, we're back
to where we started.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.240
Jeez.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.910
Front door was wide open.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.288
You scared the hell out of me.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.208
- I should have knocked but...
- Oh, no, no.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.612
Yeah. I have been working
with all this paint remover.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.323
Sometimes I get a headache
from all the fumes.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.201
- You should be taking a B complex.
- Say again?

16:09.301 --> 16:13.096
Well, a loading dose of a B-12
would help to enhance the cerebral...

16:14.306 --> 16:15.708
- Never mind.
- No, no, no.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.209
Why did you stop? That sounded great.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.752
Well, no, it just occurred to me
that I was suggesting

16:18.852 --> 16:19.962
you take a jar of vitamins,

16:20.062 --> 16:21.922
when the smart thing to do
would be to leave the door open.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.884
Look at that. I saved myself $5.95.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.468
I was in the neighborhood
looking at some houses

16:26.568 --> 16:29.237
and I thought I would take you and
your wife up on that rain check for lunch.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.683
Great. Well, Tracy is out at her class

16:32.783 --> 16:35.686
but I can get cleaned up
and we could go out ourselves.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.621
- Sounds good.
- All right. Okay, I'll be right back.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.840
So this is a real Victorian, huh?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.328
Yeah, buried under
a hundred years of paint.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.471
It was part of the underground railroad
during the civil war.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.935
What it lacks in comfort,
it makes up for in history.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.672
You know anything about architecture?

17:03.772 --> 17:06.842
Architecture? Architecture is my life.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.429
If I hadn't been a doctor,
I'd have been a...

17:10.529 --> 17:13.307
I'd have been a building.
Is this a Degas?

17:13.406 --> 17:17.201
Yeah. I think it's original.
Tracy's father gave it to her.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.461
She's been having these abdominal pains.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.908
- How often?
- Maybe once every couple of days.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.117
How long do they last?

17:32.217 --> 17:33.953
Maybe half a minute,
sometimes a little longer.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.245
Is she seeing someone?

17:35.345 --> 17:38.973
Yeah, a doctor in Boston
named Lillianfield.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.877
David Lillianfield. Do you know him?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.771
I've heard of him.
Lillianfield is a good man.

17:46.356 --> 17:51.903
The thing is, we really wanna have kids.
Tracy is nuts about it. So am I.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.405
I'll tell you what.

17:55.741 --> 18:00.604
Give it another couple of weeks and if there
is no change, have her come by and see me.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.997
- All right.
- Hey, Stanley.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.000
Hey, Doc, it hurts when I do this.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.837
Then don't do that.
And get some new jokes, Stanley.

18:11.256 --> 18:15.035
So I told him,
"Why don't you come by and look at ours,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.178
"and maybe it would work out?"

18:18.013 --> 18:19.013
You did what?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.850
You're the one who wanted to rent it out.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.560
Do I look thrilled?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.841
You're not thrilled. I can see that now,

18:28.941 --> 18:32.511
but this is better than a visiting lecturer.
Jed is a friend.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.098
He's not a friend.
He didn't even remember your name, Alan.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.727
I mean, common the guy had
just been through 12 hours of surgery.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.353
What is it, Andy?
You want to relive the high school,

18:41.453 --> 18:43.897
be friends with the quarterback
this time?

18:43.997 --> 18:48.736
No, he was the running back.
And stop talking to me like I'm 11.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.781
What's your problem with this guy?
I mean he's smart, he's funny,

18:52.881 --> 18:54.783
and he's a brilliant doctor.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.744
I know. I know he's brilliant, Andy.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.079
I can tell by the way
the nursing staff genuflect

18:59.179 --> 19:00.581
when he walks down the hallway.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.142
I mean, this guy doesn't have friends,
he has subjects.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.397
Well, it's not too late,
we can call it off.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.136
No, no. I'm leaving it up to you.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.638
If you want to live with that,
it's your decision.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.699
You're gonna get to like him.
You really will.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.394
And you know what else?

19:22.494 --> 19:25.371
We could even ask him
to recommend another doctor for you.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.232
Hold on. What?

19:27.332 --> 19:30.486
If for no other reason,
then it's ludicrous to drive two hours

19:30.586 --> 19:32.988
to see Lillianfield in Boston
when we could just easily...

19:33.088 --> 19:35.657
Andy, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Jed.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.800
Please tell me you didn't share
my problems with him.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.220
It came up.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.431
It came up.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.101
I apologize.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.005
All right.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.508
I will go along with this
for a few months

19:52.608 --> 19:56.819
only because I have my heart set on a sofa
to go with the step ladder.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.685
Oh, my God, is he moving in tonight?

20:03.785 --> 20:07.147
- You're assuming it's Jed?
- I'm quite certain it's Jed. Open the door.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.414
It could be anyone.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.627
Angels could dance on pinheads, Andy,
but they don't. It's Jed.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.757
- What makes you so sure?
- You want to bet me?

20:19.509 --> 20:20.828
No.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.971
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.042
Hello.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.253
Dr. Hill. Please come in.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.645
Hey, Jed.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.550
Andy just got through telling me
we're gonna be roommates.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.801
Well, that's why I stopped by.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.220
I just wanted to make sure
that it was really okay.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.639
Yeah. Don't be silly.
I'm looking forward to it.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.891
She is. She is really
looking forward to it.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.325
Excellent.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.506
The mid-term was at 8:30.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.785
I set my alarm for 7:00
and it didn't go off.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.539
I mean, if Professor Schmidt wants to give
me an incomplete, then I really don't care.

21:05.639 --> 21:09.767
I can't control everything in this world.
My alarm didn't go off.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.422
That's good. That's very good, Paula.

21:13.522 --> 21:17.566
That's so much better than locking
your copy of Beowulf in your friend's car.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.111
Thank You.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.514
Yeah.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.434
- Detective Harris wishes to see you.
- Really.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.561
I'm amazed she could find the building.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.105
We'll have to continue this next week
if you don't mind.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.372
Fine.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.334
Hang on, Paula.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.629
Hi, Dana, go on in.
I'll be just a second.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.076
Mrs. Worthington, I want you to note
all test and exam times for Ms. Paula Bell.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.787
She's to receive wake up calls
from this office.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.247
Wake up calls?

21:47.347 --> 21:50.959
She can't be expected to
control the world, Mrs. Worthington.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.711
Her alarm didn't go off.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.645
I'll see you next week, Paula.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.484
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.932
Was she able to
give any kind of description?

22:05.032 --> 22:07.809
All she remembers is
her cat crouching under a chair

22:07.909 --> 22:10.077
and an arm grabbing her from behind.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.066
Is there any chance
she'll remember more?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.791
I don't think so.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.444
So...

22:17.544 --> 22:19.962
- What do we do now?
- We?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.701
"We" don't do anything, Andy.
Only one of us is a police detective.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.552
Maybe not even that many.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.540
Collegiate wit. Let me search my mind
for a clever comeback.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.433
How about "bite me"?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.352
Touché.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.855
We have ordered more
"Security Precautions" pamphlets.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.801
- More pamphlets?
- That's right.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.445
Do you know what I see
when I come to work every morning?

22:45.739 --> 22:49.977
I see fathers loading steamer trunks,
suitcases, fichus plants

22:50.077 --> 22:52.062
and daughters into station wagons.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.189
Presumably to drive them off to school

22:54.289 --> 22:57.192
so that they don't pose
quite as high a death threat.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.945
See, I don't think I'm being
unreasonable when I ask

23:00.045 --> 23:02.531
what you and your
crack-team of professionals are doing

23:02.631 --> 23:05.758
other than distributing literature
to repress this situation.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.329
I need a list of anyone who had access
to the students' schedules.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.889
Both victims were out of class
when our guy got in.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.337
So you have narrowed it down
to a couple of thousand people.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.106
A list, Andy. I need it, now.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.984
Dana.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.571
- What do you think he does with the hair?
- The hair?

23:28.198 --> 23:30.991
Yeah, he cuts off all their hair.
What do you think he does with it?

23:31.660 --> 23:33.494
He makes pillows. Who knows?

23:39.167 --> 23:42.503
Billy, I want you in bed by 10:00,
you hear me?

24:39.895 --> 24:42.631
You scared the shit out of me.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.966
I'm sorry about that.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.067
What the hell are you doing in here?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.933
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.825
Anybody home?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.414
Up here, honey.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.627
This is ridiculous.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.170
Baby, go to sleep.

25:22.270 --> 25:25.757
Who the hell can sleep
with them going at it all night?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.801
It's been like three hours.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.053
I'll ask him to turn it down.

25:30.153 --> 25:33.515
No, I don't want to make
a big thing about it.

25:33.615 --> 25:36.116
No, no, if you can't fall asleep...

25:41.581 --> 25:44.708
- You think maybe he heard us?
- I hope so.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.672
- Where're you going?
- To the bathroom.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.683
I know why guys like you become doctors.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.879
- It's not what you think.
- Yeah?

26:03.979 --> 26:08.440
I think it's so you can make a lot of money
and see a lot of naked women.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.986
Well, then it is what you think.

26:17.659 --> 26:21.579
Hey, pace yourself.
I'm not done with you yet.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.567
- I'm impervious to alcohol.
- Yeah?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.793
We'll see about that.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.137
Tracy.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.021
You all right?

26:52.193 --> 26:54.236
Yeah. I'll be right there.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.499
- You had me worried for a second.
- No, I'm fine.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.180
Come on, let's go to bed.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.777
Hey, hey. Got to get out there, old man.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.821
Six miles a day keeps the doctor away.

27:52.921 --> 27:56.992
- You want some coffee?
- No, never touch in the morning.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.995
- You okay, Trace?
- I'm fine.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.415
Well, I'll grab quick shower,
fly over to the hospital.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.182
I'll catch you guys later.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.772
Are you sure she didn't call to
cancel her appointment?

28:27.872 --> 28:30.457
Yes, I'm sure. In fact,
I called her yesterday to remind her.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.654
- Did you try calling her again?
- Nobody's there, professor.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.199
- I keep getting her answering machine.
- She's there.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.675
She's dodging the call.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.075
Paula?

29:20.675 --> 29:21.925
Paula!

30:52.225 --> 30:54.309
I'm gonna need a statement.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.232
Andy.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.616
You wanna hear about the first time
I ever saw a corpse?

31:11.828 --> 31:12.896
No.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.483
It was my first year of medical school,
gross anatomy.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.069
The takes a real saw
to the cadavers head.

31:20.169 --> 31:23.990
People were running out of the room.
They're passing out, turning green.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.702
I tell you, it really didn't
bother me over that much, though.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.037
It's a great story, Jed.

31:29.137 --> 31:33.724
Of course, I'll never look at a cantaloupe
the same way again, but other than that...

31:35.602 --> 31:38.186
Hey, You'll get over it.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.724
Hey, Stanley, who the hell is that
in the backfield?

31:49.824 --> 31:52.769
Livelle something. He's off the bench.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.371
- What happened to Krakowski?
- Flunked the piss test.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.834
That upsets me.

32:02.712 --> 32:06.423
Guy can't stay off of cocaine
even for one million dollars.

32:08.009 --> 32:11.079
Man, I'll give my right arm
for a million dollars.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.139
We cannot afford plumbing,
for Christ's sake.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.185
- Would you really?
- What?

32:18.853 --> 32:21.313
Give your right arm
for one million dollars?

32:24.233 --> 32:26.735
- You mean like, literally?
- Yeah.

32:28.404 --> 32:32.199
Well, not even an arm.
Let's just say a finger.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.995
One finger, for one million dollars?

32:39.332 --> 32:41.734
Oh, God, this is a strange conversation.

32:41.834 --> 32:45.071
What we're talking about
is a surgical procedure

32:45.171 --> 32:48.090
just to the joint. Would you do it?

32:51.177 --> 32:52.219
No.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.555
Really?

32:56.975 --> 32:57.975
Would you?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.231
No.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.429
Oh, man.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.906
I should be getting back.
Here, let me...

33:13.992 --> 33:15.476
No, no, no, no.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.437
Hey, stay and have
one more drink with me.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.621
No. Tracy's gonna be home.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.207
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.383
Stanley.

33:32.927 --> 33:36.763
Would you please bring those two girls
a round of whatever it is they're drinking?

33:37.390 --> 33:39.558
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon it is.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.657
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.786
This is the living room.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.789
Have a seat.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.029
I just need you to
clear up a few things for me.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.463
Like what?

34:11.799 --> 34:14.159
Paula Bell came to see you three times,
is that right?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.244
That's right.

34:15.344 --> 34:18.847
- It would have been four times, only...
- What is this?

34:19.974 --> 34:23.418
Last night we matched the soil sample
taken from Paula Bell's carpet

34:23.518 --> 34:25.713
to a sample taken from your yard.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.440
I went inside, I told you that.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.069
We also matched it to a sample
taken from Bridget Kelly's room.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.614
Bridget came by here to
pick up a letter of recommendation.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.393
Am I a suspect, Dana?

34:38.493 --> 34:40.077
Am I a fucking suspect?

34:40.495 --> 34:43.731
All three victims had been in to see you
before they were attacked.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.150
I found Paula, for Christ's sake.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.445
- What was it that made you go to her house?
- She missed her appointment.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.822
So you went to her house?

34:50.922 --> 34:54.074
Yes, because she was a screw-up
and I have a responsibility.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.577
- What's your blood type, Andy?
- O positive.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.079
See, as luck would have it,

34:58.179 --> 35:01.374
you have the same blood type
as the perpetrator.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.459
Dana, this is crazy.

35:03.559 --> 35:06.186
In my entire life
I have never harmed anyone.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.190
I believe you.
I don't think you're the guy.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.818
Thank you.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.932
I need you to do something for me.

35:18.032 --> 35:21.811
It's procedural, I wouldn't be doing
my job if I didn't ask you to do it.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.021
Do what?

35:23.121 --> 35:27.374
I need a sperm sample to test
against the one taken from the victims.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.569
I can't believe this.

35:29.669 --> 35:34.214
It's a simple thing, take maybe in an hour.
You'll be eliminated as a suspect.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.759
What if I refuse?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.346
You get to wear my handcuffs.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.006
- Damn.
- No, no. That's much better.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.591
- No, it's not.
- No, it is.

35:51.691 --> 35:54.776
At least you're not
hitting innocent bystanders.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.534
Beautiful.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.039
Andy.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.209
Andy.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.890
Oh, God.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.643
911. Emergency.

37:11.646 --> 37:16.399
The rotator cuff, if you don't mind,
it's right in here, okay.

37:16.901 --> 37:21.029
I pierce that, he can't even comb
his hair, let alone throw a ball.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.228
That thing's been beeping all night.
Are you a drug dealer?

37:27.328 --> 37:29.287
Yeah, you can say that.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.623
Stanley.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.239
Somebody talk to me.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.616
We've got massive hemorrhaging.
It's probably an ovary.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.285
We'll have some more numbers
in a few minutes.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.079
- Blood type.
- AB negative. We need more.

37:45.179 --> 37:48.583
Tanya, get a hold of the Mass General,
Boston, and Mercy, Hartford, in that order.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.141
If they're low, we're gonna need donors.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.527
I'm sorry we had to
put you through this, Andy.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.946
You can go home now.

38:04.740 --> 38:05.865
Andy.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.371
- Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.795
Your wife's name came up on a 911.
It's a medical emergency.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.784
- David, what's the blood pressure?
- 93 above 57.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.912
- Heart rate?
- 86.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.622
- Quick count?
- 27.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.515
Jed, did you see this?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.731
Four to five weeks would be my guess.

38:40.234 --> 38:43.137
- She is pregnant?
- Not for long.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.447
Her fetus will abort
from the trauma of the procedure.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.918
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

39:02.923 --> 39:03.965
Dr. Hill.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.264
All right, let's go.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.937
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.017
- Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

39:30.117 --> 39:32.979
- What happened to my wife?
- She's bleeding internally.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.956
Dr. Hill will come and talk to you
soon as her condition is stabilized.

39:37.875 --> 39:41.127
- Is she conscious?
- I'm sorry Mr. Safian, that's all I know.

39:49.303 --> 39:51.414
We're almost done.
I just wanna have one last look around.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.873
Check for rings and watches.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.724
- Suction.
- Suction.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.050
All right, I think we've got it all.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.692
It's amazing it didn't rupture sooner.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.657
Jed.

40:11.700 --> 40:14.911
We've got some pathology
in the second ovary.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.460
- Let me have a look in here. Harrington.
- Harrington.

40:24.296 --> 40:25.964
It was torsed when I unpacked it.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.385
Think it's necrotic?

40:31.262 --> 40:33.039
All right I want to do a frozen section
right away,

40:33.139 --> 40:34.623
see if we still get a viable ovary here.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.334
- We can't.
- Why not?

40:36.434 --> 40:39.587
- The pathologist isn't in house.
- Well, what do I do for frozen section?

40:39.687 --> 40:42.048
- We can call him in.
- How long would that take?

40:42.148 --> 40:43.174
30, 40 minutes.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.009
Hell, I'd better get a microscope
and do it myself.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.596
It'll take at least a half an hour
for the processor to warm up.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.931
- What's the pressure?
- 78.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.741
- I don't have that kind of time.
- You got maybe half that, tops.

40:56.704 --> 41:00.999
All right. Irrigate and try to
get the BP back up. I'll be right back.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.201
- Come with me.
- What's going on?

41:10.301 --> 41:11.968
Just come with me.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.605
I had to remove one of Tracy's ovaries.

41:24.565 --> 41:29.303
It ruptured. A large cyst had developed
and that what was causing her pain.

41:29.403 --> 41:32.155
I have to be direct with you
because we're little under the gun.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.241
- Is it under control?
- Not yet.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.438
There is a problem
with Tracy's second ovary.

41:39.538 --> 41:43.583
We discovered it was torsed or twisted
around in its own blood supply.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.654
If I remove it, I'm simply
removing a dead organ

41:46.754 --> 41:50.590
and in all likelihood
Tracy will lead a normal, healthy life.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.467
But...

41:55.596 --> 41:58.306
She won't ever be able to have children.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.894
If I close her up now, she could die of
toxic-shock in the middle of the night.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.276
Do whatever you have to do.

42:11.570 --> 42:14.405
- Tracy's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.810
- But what?
- I'll tell you later.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.119
No. No, tell me now.

42:31.131 --> 42:34.008
Tracy was pregnant. Of four weeks.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.095
- Tracy is pregnant?
- No Andy.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.957
The fetus aborted.

42:40.057 --> 42:43.935
She sustained a lot of trauma.
There was nothing that could be done.

42:45.813 --> 42:48.022
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.827
Vascular clamp.

43:16.927 --> 43:21.582
Dr. Hill, I think this might be a mistake.
How do you know it's not still viable?

43:21.682 --> 43:25.518
This is the wife of a friend, Matthew.
I'm not taking any chances. Scalpel.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.229
You could be taking out a viable ovary.

43:31.567 --> 43:34.595
It's necrotic. Scalpel.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.430
Without the histology,
you can't be sure.

43:36.530 --> 43:37.864
I'm sure.

43:39.325 --> 43:41.826
Tanya, give me the scalpel.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.081
Jed.

44:33.754 --> 44:36.547
- What you got there, George?
- It's from pathology.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.969
The Histology report?

44:44.598 --> 44:46.182
We took out a healthy ovary.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.268
Only the surface was necrotic.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.606
Jed, take this.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.611
Look at it.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.947
Then burn it.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.771
That's a nice gesture, George. Really.

45:07.871 --> 45:11.900
The technician owes me a favor.
Lab won't be a problem.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.611
It'll be a problem for me.

45:13.711 --> 45:17.130
This hospital took out a healthy ovary.

45:17.631 --> 45:20.091
I took out the ovary. No one else.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.971
It was a judgment call
and I stand by it.

45:30.310 --> 45:33.354
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine.

45:36.608 --> 45:38.693
I didn't do anything wrong.

46:00.007 --> 46:02.242
I figured you probably hadn't
eaten anything in a while.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.843
We should talk later, okay?

46:06.054 --> 46:08.749
Well, Andy, I wanted to have
a word with Tracy.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.418
Maybe later, okay? Jed...

46:11.518 --> 46:13.519
Hello, Mrs. Safian.

46:14.688 --> 46:17.091
You gave us quite a scare.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.524
Did I?

46:20.235 --> 46:22.570
Tracy, I know you've been told
all about what's happened.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.697
Yes.

46:25.532 --> 46:28.034
I don't know if there's any point in
telling you how sorry I am.

46:29.870 --> 46:32.371
I spoke with a lawyer this morning.

46:33.540 --> 46:37.043
I want to make sure you don't
do this to someone else.

46:54.895 --> 46:57.131
There'll be some depositions
in about a week.

46:57.231 --> 47:00.175
I think we can bring them down from
the 30 million in a settlement.

47:00.275 --> 47:02.594
Let's not dick each other around here.

47:02.694 --> 47:05.597
30 million, 25 million,
what difference does it make?

47:05.697 --> 47:07.558
You know anything
over 10 million dollars

47:07.658 --> 47:10.144
and I can't get insurance in this
or any other state.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.146
- I say we go to a jury.
- I can't recommend that.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.355
Why not?

47:13.455 --> 47:15.774
Let me tell you what a jury sees.

47:15.874 --> 47:19.945
A jury sees a beautiful young woman
married to a mild-mannered teacher.

47:20.045 --> 47:23.615
They buy an old house and dream of
filling it up with children.

47:23.715 --> 47:25.492
Now that is a Norman Rockwell painting

47:25.592 --> 47:28.829
and you have ripped it to shreds
with your scalpel.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.998
You are my lawyer. Am I right here?

47:31.098 --> 47:33.000
It's not my job
to hold your hand, doctor.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.043
It's not your job
to be an asshole either, counselor,

47:35.143 --> 47:36.587
but that doesn't seem
to be stopping here.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.729
Maybe if we all calm down.

47:40.023 --> 47:43.051
We could bring in a private investigator,
dig up something on her background.

47:43.151 --> 47:46.722
Lester, she volunteered five days a week
in a children's ward.

47:46.822 --> 47:49.099
And baked cookies for the staff.

47:49.199 --> 47:51.935
Looks like you picked the
wrong patient to screw up on, doctor.

47:52.035 --> 47:56.873
I didn't pick her, counselor.
Physicians don't get to choose.

47:57.916 --> 48:00.527
I'll need an 'expert.
Who do you want to call?

48:00.627 --> 48:04.698
- What do you mean?
- An expert. Someone to make a statement.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.033
A statement saying what?

48:06.133 --> 48:08.801
A statement saying that
you are as good as you think you are.

48:14.182 --> 48:17.810
Call Dr. Martin Kessler.
Harvard Medical School.

48:19.271 --> 48:20.631
Is that it, Miss?

48:20.731 --> 48:21.814
Yes.

48:25.569 --> 48:28.613
- How will I get in touch with you?
- You won't.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.615
I don't want you to.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.786
Tracy, why won't you let me help you
get through this?

48:36.830 --> 48:38.831
This isn't a phase, Andy.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.961
I can't have children. Ever.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.797
He thought you were going to die.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.051
Right about now he's wishing I did.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.554
Tracy, I love you.

48:56.475 --> 48:58.351
He took my insides out,

48:59.061 --> 49:01.228
and you gave him permission.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.194
Goodbye, Andy.

49:27.506 --> 49:31.618
Dr. Kessler, would you describe
your history and relationship to Dr. Hill?

49:31.718 --> 49:35.163
Dr. Hill was a student of mine
at medical school.

49:35.263 --> 49:38.000
Upon graduation I asked him
to serve his residency

49:38.100 --> 49:40.836
under my direction at Mass General.

49:40.936 --> 49:45.966
And when he finished the residency,
I asked him to join our surgical staff.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.719
Dr. Kessler, how long have you been
teaching at Harvard Medical school?

49:48.819 --> 49:49.944
Twenty-one years.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.930
How long have you been
chief of staff at Mass General?

49:52.030 --> 49:53.015
Fourteen years.

49:53.115 --> 49:56.184
So you've been in a position to work with
thousands of young doctors. Am I correct?

49:56.284 --> 49:57.311
Yes.

49:57.411 --> 50:00.939
I might add that the doctors I've had
the pleasure to teach and work with

50:01.039 --> 50:03.124
are among the very best in the world.

50:03.250 --> 50:07.237
And how would Dr. Hill rank in this group
that are among the very best in the world?

50:07.337 --> 50:09.922
- There's no one any better.
- Thank you.

50:10.882 --> 50:11.966
Mr. Riley.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.762
Dr. Kessler, your faith in Dr. Hill's
surgical talent is obvious.

50:17.639 --> 50:18.889
And completely deserved.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.210
Dr. Kessler, seven months ago
the position of Chief of Surgery

50:22.310 --> 50:23.629
became available on Mass General.

50:23.729 --> 50:24.922
Did Jed Hill seek this position?

50:25.022 --> 50:26.173
Yes, he did.

50:26.273 --> 50:30.067
- Did you give the position to Jed?
- Excuse me, my client's name is Dr. Hill.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.194
Forgive me,
did you award the position to Dr. Hill?

50:32.738 --> 50:34.598
- No.
- Why not?

50:34.698 --> 50:36.032
Well, he was certainly qualified...

50:36.283 --> 50:38.185
But you didn't give him the job.

50:38.285 --> 50:39.785
There were many other candidates.

50:40.454 --> 50:43.122
- Surgeons more qualified?
- This isn't a trial, Mr. Riley.

50:43.707 --> 50:46.109
Dr. Kessler, during Dr. Hill's
residency in Mass General

50:46.209 --> 50:48.028
you wrote several quarterly evaluations.

50:48.128 --> 50:52.074
Evaluations to be read and reviewed
by hospital administrators,

50:52.174 --> 50:53.367
department heads.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.701
Yes.

50:54.801 --> 50:58.705
I'm looking at one right now

50:58.805 --> 51:02.292
dated June 15th, 1982,
and bearing your signature.

51:02.392 --> 51:04.185
It's coming around.

51:07.647 --> 51:13.971
I'd like to read from page three,
paragraph four.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.056
"While Jed Hill consistently remains
the most skilled

51:16.156 --> 51:17.224
"and the brightest of our residents,

51:17.324 --> 51:19.559
"we should not ignore what I and several
of his colleagues observed

51:19.659 --> 51:21.911
"to be an indulgence
of the 'God complex'."

51:22.996 --> 51:26.040
"God complex." That's not a typo, was it?
It says "God complex."

51:28.376 --> 51:29.919
That was written a decade ago.

51:30.670 --> 51:31.837
What's a God complex?

51:32.714 --> 51:34.866
How did you get this information?
This was privileged information.

51:34.966 --> 51:37.093
Dr. Kessler, what's a God complex?

51:37.677 --> 51:42.416
It's a term that has no clinical meaning
at all. Doctors throw it around...

51:42.516 --> 51:44.183
Sir, with all due respect,
but knock it off.

51:44.392 --> 51:47.228
What did you mean in this evaluation
when you said Dr. Hill had a God complex?

51:48.772 --> 51:53.400
The power to heal can be
an enormous thing, an enormous thing.

51:55.028 --> 51:59.141
To save a life, to get blood flowing
into cells and vital organs.

51:59.241 --> 52:04.870
If a person can do that, and if one
can do it as exceptionally as Dr. Hill,

52:05.622 --> 52:10.459
it's not uncommon for a person like that
to begin to believe that he can do anything.

52:11.419 --> 52:15.047
The power to heal can be like a drug.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.783
"Like a drug", you're saying?

52:16.883 --> 52:20.678
Would it be uncommon for a person with a
God complex to reject the advice of others?

52:21.596 --> 52:22.680
No.

52:23.515 --> 52:26.626
Would it be uncommon for such a person
to proceed on a course

52:26.726 --> 52:29.270
that others might reject if only
out of a sense of a God like power?

52:29.855 --> 52:31.923
I think now you're vastly overstating.

52:32.023 --> 52:35.635
- Is that why you didn't give Dr. Hill the job?
- There were a number of other factors.

52:35.735 --> 52:38.638
Is that why you removed a healthy ovary
without any scientific diagnosis?

52:38.738 --> 52:41.141
Don't you address my client, Mr. Riley.

52:41.241 --> 52:42.741
Do you have a God complex?

52:42.951 --> 52:44.019
This is not acceptable.

52:44.119 --> 52:46.370
- No, no. Let him address me.
- Jed.

52:46.538 --> 52:49.665
No, no. It's about time.
I got to give some answers here.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.917
Stop typing. This is off the record.

52:55.005 --> 52:58.090
The question is,
do I have a God complex?

52:58.550 --> 52:59.800
Dr. Kessler says yes.

53:01.511 --> 53:02.621
Which makes me wonder

53:02.721 --> 53:08.684
if this lawyer has any idea

53:09.019 --> 53:12.130
as to the kind of grades
one has to receive in college

53:12.230 --> 53:14.982
to be accepted at a top medical school.

53:15.483 --> 53:19.679
If you have the vaguest clue
as to how talented someone has to be

53:19.779 --> 53:21.864
to lead a surgical team.

53:23.617 --> 53:26.186
I have an M.D. from Harvard,

53:26.286 --> 53:29.189
I am board certified
in cardio-thoracic medicine

53:29.289 --> 53:31.233
and trauma surgery,

53:31.333 --> 53:32.692
I have been awarded citations

53:32.792 --> 53:35.695
from seven different medical boards
in New England,

53:35.795 --> 53:39.950
and I am never, ever sick at sea.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.369
So I ask you,

53:42.469 --> 53:43.870
when someone goes into that chapel

53:43.970 --> 53:46.456
and they fall on their knees
and they pray to God

53:46.556 --> 53:48.625
that their wife doesn't miscarry

53:48.725 --> 53:51.128
or that their daughter
doesn't bleed to death,

53:51.228 --> 53:56.716
or that their mother doesn't suffer acute
neural trauma from post-operative shock,

53:56.816 --> 53:58.817
who do you think they're praying to?

54:00.654 --> 54:06.518
Now, go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis,
and you go to your church,

54:06.618 --> 54:09.312
and, with any luck,
you might win the annual raffle,

54:09.412 --> 54:11.898
but if you're looking for God,

54:11.998 --> 54:15.569
he was in operating room number two
on November 17,

54:15.669 --> 54:18.504
and he doesn't like
to be second guessed.

54:20.507 --> 54:24.995
You ask me if I have a God complex.
Let me tell you something.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.845
I am God.

54:28.431 --> 54:30.474
And this sideshow is over.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.638
You got a winner here, Lester.

54:43.738 --> 54:46.573
Call my office in the morning
and we'll work out a settlement.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.910
- It gets better.
- What do you mean?

54:50.745 --> 54:53.789
We talked to the bartender
of a place called Prince William Tavern.

54:54.332 --> 54:58.210
Ask God how many shots of bourbon
he had before he cut me open.

55:05.468 --> 55:06.953
The insurance company will wire a draft

55:07.053 --> 55:09.122
into my firm's account
by sometime next week.

55:09.222 --> 55:10.290
Assuming you sign it right away,

55:10.390 --> 55:13.501
you should get your money
few days after that.

55:13.601 --> 55:15.253
Listen, there are some things
we should discuss now,

55:15.353 --> 55:16.630
like an umbrella policy.

55:16.730 --> 55:18.673
Dennis, this isn't such
a good time for me.

55:18.773 --> 55:20.592
Tracy, we're talking about $20 million.

55:20.692 --> 55:23.803
Dennis, I think about what I want
for breakfast, I start crying.

55:23.903 --> 55:26.989
You can put the money in a coffee can,
for all I care.

56:05.987 --> 56:08.697
- It's after 8:30.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.993
- You should go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.005
Mrs. Worthington.

56:26.132 --> 56:27.758
Mrs. Worthington.

57:30.488 --> 57:31.947
Mr. Leemus.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.501
Mr. Leemus.

58:37.096 --> 58:38.222
Jesus!

58:39.891 --> 58:41.016
You surprised me.

58:41.935 --> 58:44.645
I was working on the furnace.
I didn't know anybody else was here.

58:46.773 --> 58:48.174
I saw the lights...

58:48.274 --> 58:50.635
It's my mother's hair.

58:50.735 --> 58:53.570
She's not alive anymore.
That's her in the picture.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.727
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get any of your things.

58:59.827 --> 59:02.397
- That's okay.
- I just, I...

59:02.497 --> 59:06.875
I came down to get a light bulb.
I didn't realize that...

59:09.671 --> 59:13.048
- You live down here?
- No, no. Just for a while.

59:13.591 --> 59:16.744
My landlady asked me to leave,
put me in a tight spot.

59:16.844 --> 59:19.289
I won't stay here long. No.
I promise, Mr. Safian.

59:19.389 --> 59:22.709
No, you stay here
as long as you want, Earl.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.587
- I'll just take this and I'll head back out.
- Sure.

59:25.687 --> 59:28.313
- Good night, Mr. Safian.
- Good night, Earl.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.049
Don't worry,
you don't look as bad as the other guy.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.567
So help me God, I could have killed him.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.822
Junior, have you met the professor?
A very tough guy.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.661
If you want something done all right,
goddamn it, you call a teacher.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.623
Let me buy you a drink.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:23.428
You know, there is one thing
I realized during all of this.

01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:28.918
Jed had just come out of the OR
to talk to me. He was covered in blood

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.962
and he was telling me
what he was about to do

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:34.465
and then he needed
my permission to do it.

01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:39.220
And there was a second,
maybe a second and a half,

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.015
between him telling me
that Tracy was pregnant

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.325
and him telling me that the fetus
was aborted during surgery.

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:51.373
And that second, that second and a half,

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:56.294
that was the happiest time in my life.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:05.804
That is a horrible story.
It's the worst story I've ever heard.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.933
And I appreciate your words of comfort.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.712
I mean it, Andy.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:16.523
You're like a fucking Job,
shit just happens to you.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:22.988
Have you had a lot of success
talking jumpers in from window ledges?

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:30.412
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.581
How well do you know Tracy?

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:37.127
She's my wife. What do you mean?

01:02:44.802 --> 01:02:48.998
My brothers, my friends,
and my ex-husband

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:53.185
Have all accused me of wielding my sense
of honesty like a blunt instrument.

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:57.606
I don't want to hurt you anymore
than you have been,

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:02.778
but I'm fairly sure
I'm doing the right thing.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.113
What are you talking about?

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.328
I want you to come back to the station
with me.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.581
I wanna show you something.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:42.400
- Sir? Sir, can I help you?
- I'm gonna see Jed Hill.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.043
What the hell happened to you?

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.087
It wasn't my baby.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.755
What?

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.632
It wasn't my baby.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.468
Come inside.
What the hell happened to your face?

01:04:09.428 --> 01:04:11.998
Doesn't matter. You know what this is?

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.917
This is a police test.
It's a lab report.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.127
I don't understand.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.172
It is a sperm sample I made
after the Paula Bell rape.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.689
I'm sterile.

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.609
Can I have a look at that, please?

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.738
I can't have any children,
so it wasn't my baby.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.976
You got to call your lawyer, Jed.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:34.562
You call your lawyer,
you have 'em tell the insurance company

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:37.789
to stop the presses because this thing,
no, it's not over yet.

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:39.567
Andy, this isn't about me.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.944
It's about both of us, Jed.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:45.755
She reamed both of us. It's too late for me,
but it's not too late for you.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:50.036
Andy, I don't mean to seem indelicate,
but as far as my situation is concerned,

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:53.555
it doesn't matter if Tracy was sleeping
with the Boston Celtics.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.641
I took out her reproductive system.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:01.339
It was a wrong call
and the bill was $20 million.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:06.219
No. That's where you're wrong. See,
the $20 million is a big settlement, right?

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:10.223
That wasn't for the fuck-up.
That was for the victim.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:11.933
The insurance company
settled high and fast

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:14.826
because they thought
they're up against Snow White.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:19.623
What happens if Snow White is shacking up
with her lawyer Jed, huh?

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.458
You tell me.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.237
Andy, you're hurt and you want revenge.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:28.533
And I can understand that,
but I got what I deserved.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:32.203
And you know something,
as much as this pains you,

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.846
no matter what Tracy
was doing behind your back,

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:38.058
she got a hell of a lot worse
than she deserved.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:42.187
Did I?

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:47.108
- Did you what?
- Did I get what I deserved?

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:52.849
Bad things happen to good people
all the time, Andy, and for no reason.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.157
Take my word for it.

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.537
I'll see you later.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.416
What are you gonna do, Andy?

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:08.088
I'm gonna go out
and get to know my wife.

01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:23.921
Hi, Dennis!

01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:26.173
He doesn't have an appointment, Mr. Riley.
He just walked right in.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:27.925
She tried to stop me, Dennis.

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:30.177
See, I can call him Dennis
'cause we're old friends.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.778
We both slept with my wife.

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:33.196
Claudia, call security.

01:06:33.447 --> 01:06:36.142
Do that Claudia
and then call the US Attorney's office

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.561
and see if conspiracy
to commit insurance fraud

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.146
comes under their jurisdiction.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.288
- Forget security, Claudia.
- Sir?

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.874
Just close the door behind you.
Thank you.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.135
This... This is a nice office.

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.595
What the hell happened to your face?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:02.350
I beat the shit out
of a deeply disturbed serial rapist.

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:07.063
Hey, I want an explanation.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:08.773
An explanation for what?

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:13.319
For how my wife could have been pregnant
when her husband's sterile?

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:18.517
What was it? Immaculate conception?

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:22.579
If that's the case, Dennis, I wouldn't have
settled for $20 million if I were you.

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.691
Andy, I had no knowledge of this.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:28.251
And I wasn't sleeping with your wife,
if that's what you're suggesting.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.795
Bullshit.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.049
Then what can I do for you, Andy?

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.634
You can tell me where Tracy is.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.830
Telling you where Tracy is
would break an attorney-client privilege,

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.874
and I will not do that.

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:43.084
Now there is nothing more I can do.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.435
Claudia will be happy
to call the US Attorney for you.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.272
Were you sleeping with her?

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:50.940
No.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.405
Can you help me?

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:01.242
Help you do what?
What is it you want, Andy?

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.027
I want to talk to Tracy.

01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:12.071
- Andy...
- I know I'm asking you a favor.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.449
I have a professional obligation.
I have a legal obligation to my client.

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:19.912
Your problems, your questions,
cold as this may seem, are not my business.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:21.122
And I haven't got the answers you want.

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:22.832
Even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to give them to you.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.375
Talk to her friends, talk to her mother,

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.169
talk to the people she works with
at the hospital.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:30.006
- What did you say?
- I'm saying this is a personal matter.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.689
Did you say, "Talk to her mother?"

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.566
She certainly knows Tracy
better than I do.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.234
Her mother is dead.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.279
- When did she die?
- Twelve years ago.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.366
You handled the estate.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.577
No, I didn't.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.371
What are you saying to me?

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.066
I'm saying I didn't handle
Mrs. Kennsinger's estate,

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.609
and anything outside of the framework
of your wife's lawsuit is not my...

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.612
I don't give a fuck
about the lawsuit, Dennis.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.781
- All I'm asking you...
- Then we have nothing here to talk about.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.716
Is her mother alive?
Where does she live?

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.178
- Please understand...
- Fuck it. I'll find her myself.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.346
Andy.

01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:08.518
- Scotch.
- What?

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.020
Bring her a bottle of scotch.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:38.756
- My name is Andy Safian.
- So what?

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.176
Did your daughter ever tell you
she had a husband?

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.830
Did your wife ever tell you
she had a mother?

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.165
Yeah.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.348
You're a liar.

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:50.268
She said you were dead.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.714
What do you want from me?

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:57.066
- It's nothing. I just thought...
- Nobody wants nothing.

01:09:57.943 --> 01:10:01.154
I thought maybe we could
have a drink and talk.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.240
She sure loved her daddy.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.159
Second best confidence man
south of Boston.

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:25.955
He taught her everything.
She was daddy's girl.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.666
I wanted to ask you some questions.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.683
She tried to do the smart thing,
I give her that.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.337
The smart thing. What was that?

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.313
Marry a bank account. What do you think?

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.023
Tracy was married before?

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.984
I said she tried.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.055
You got to pay attention.

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:45.349
One of Bill's old partners,
a guy from Newport.

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:47.867
Millionaire with a heart problem.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:52.705
He wouldn't marry her though.
Not even after she got pregnant.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.832
Mrs. Kennsinger, I...

01:10:57.294 --> 01:11:00.948
This is single malt scotch.

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.284
That was so classy, mister.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.510
I haven't had single malt since '69.

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:12.251
I drink crap. Blended whiskey is crap,
I don't give what color the label is.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.519
I need to find Tracy.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.897
Tell me the part again where she was
working with children's ward.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:22.694
Like I told you, she likes kids.
So she...

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:25.947
What?

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.199
What?

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.952
Did I say something funny?

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:37.041
That girls sure found herself a live one.
Like shooting tuna fish in a barrel.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.714
Big one, too.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.303
You're drunk.

01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:50.471
And you're stupid.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:55.685
I can say that to you because
you're my son-in-law.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:57.937
Want to see something?

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:00.940
I want you to tell me where Tracy is.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:05.069
I'm older, I'm smarter.
You can learn something from me.

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:07.655
I know she's been here.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.368
Andy. Is it Andy?

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.412
- Yeah.
- Andy.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.484
It's a simple trick.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:19.860
The statue...

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.655
- What?
- This, the Degas.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.324
Yeah. What about it?

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:29.677
It was in my house. It was Tracy's.
So I know she's been here.

01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:33.097
Andy, believe me.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:35.834
You need to see this trick.

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.769
- Do you get that I'm serious?
- Pick a card.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:41.356
I got it. Pick a card.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.243
Look at it.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:58.289
Put it back in the deck.

01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:07.825
Shuffle the deck.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.968
- Mrs. Kennsinger, I don't want...
- You can call me "Mom."

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:15.098
I don't think so.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:20.144
Shuffle the cards.
And shuffle them good.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.883
Bill and me, we used to give Tracy
a little bit of the money each week

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:27.819
so she could buy candy.
Shuffle the cards!

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.118
She wouldn't spend it though, not a penny.
Each week she put it under the mattress.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:39.831
I swear I think that kid had maybe
200 bucks under the mattress.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:44.403
I'll tell you something else
about Tracy.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:45.863
I don't think it bothered her a bit

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:49.340
when her father cleaned out
the bank accounts and disappeared.

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:55.847
I think it bothered her when he took
the 200 dollars from under the mattress.

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:59.350
Jesus. What the hell
kind of a family is this?

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:02.629
- Want to bet me a double-C?
- What?

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:05.424
200 bucks. You wanna give me 200 bucks
if I know what your card is?

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:07.024
I'll give you 200 bucks if I don't.

01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:08.693
No.

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:12.014
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.224
Look, you said there was
a point here and I...

01:14:14.324 --> 01:14:16.935
Why do you give a Frenchman's fuck
who she was sleeping with?

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:19.912
Get into the game.
Go for the 20 million yourself.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.208
Are you saying that Tracy set this up?

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.880
What the hell have I been telling you?
Am I talking to my shadow?

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:33.285
You think you're Sherlock Holmes
with this statue?

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.954
You can buy them in any
departmental store for $89.95.

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:37.331
Looks just like the real thing.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:42.727
The whole thing was a setup?
You're crazy.

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:45.229
Yeah?

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:48.774
Then how come I have the jack of clubs
in my fucking pocket?

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:03.482
Look, kid, I don't know
what the game is.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.958
But you got stung,
so did your friend, the surgeon.

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:11.088
Maybe, it's best to just take a medicine
like a good little boy and go home.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.760
Do me a favor. Leave me this scotch.

01:15:21.725 --> 01:15:22.975
Whatever happened to the baby?

01:15:24.436 --> 01:15:27.146
- What baby?
- The Newport millionaire, the baby.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:31.051
She pocketed the money
he gave her for an abortion.

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.986
Went downtown to a clinic.
She ended up working for the doctor.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.516
There's a happy ending, though.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:40.727
She disappeared with 80,000
of the clinic's money.

01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:43.856
- How much of that do you think I saw?
- What was the name of the doctor?

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.816
How much you think I'm going to see
from this 20 million?

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:48.125
Was the name of the doctor
David Lillianfield?

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.487
How much do you think she's gonna give
her dead mother?

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:52.030
- Was it?
- Was what what?

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.158
You think you can drink like this
and remember a name?

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:57.301
Was the name of the doctor
David Lillianfield?

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:02.139
Welcome to the game.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:53.399
Hello.

01:16:58.488 --> 01:16:59.864
Excuse me.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.617
Can I talk to your manager?

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.985
Mr. Hearn leaves at 5:00.
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:13.320
I'm Dr. Lillianfield.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:17.965
Mr. Hearn wanted me to come by to fill out
a change of address card for your billing.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:33.272
- Was that Lillianfield?
- Yeah. David.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:40.097
All right. Why don't you just write it
on the back of the old card

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.599
and we'll take care
of the rest tomorrow.

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:44.033
Okay. Thanks.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.669
Where is the key?

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.677
I'm soaked.

01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:52.429
God! I'm freezing.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.599
It's cold in here.

01:20:57.769 --> 01:21:00.437
We must do something about the latch.

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.940
We got to get this latch fixed.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.236
This damn door is driving me crazy.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.409
I'm chilled to the bone.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.293
Warm me up, I'm freezing.

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.968
Take me upstairs and fuck me.

01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:13.865
I should be heading back to town.

01:24:13.965 --> 01:24:15.174
We just got here.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.635
I know, but it's broad daylight.

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:21.930
Relax. It's a done deal.

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:24.892
I'm cutting the check on Monday.

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:29.229
What's wrong with you?

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:33.150
- I got a letter today.
- From who?

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.570
Whom, from whom. From Dr. Kessler.

01:24:37.363 --> 01:24:38.765
What did he say?

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:41.184
He didn't say, Tracy.
It was a letter. He wrote.

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:45.996
Jed, take a drink, take a pill, do whatever
it is you have to, but lighten the fuck up.

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:47.664
What did he write?

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.377
That he was sorry.
That he was very sorry.

01:24:54.005 --> 01:24:56.006
That was thoughtful of him.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:59.593
- What?
- That was.

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:02.205
The man put us over the top.
I was in the room.

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:05.557
The bartender was just icing,
but Kessler was the one who closed it.

01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.144
Come on,
what more do you want from the man?

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.981
I want him to know it.

01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:17.721
I want him to know
that I was holding the strings.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.948
He's sorry? Let him say
he was sorry about Mass General.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.311
When he says he was wrong, when
he says that I should have gotten the job,

01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:29.748
then you talk about bygones
being bygones.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.551
In the meantime,
I think I'll send him a postcard.

01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:43.121
There, that's the spirit.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:47.292
A picture of me sitting under a palm tree
with $10 million in one hand

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:51.228
and a copy of his God complex memo
in the other.

01:25:52.188 --> 01:25:55.175
- With an inscription.
- What would it say?

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:57.010
It wouldn't say anything. It would read.

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.777
Attagirl, Trace.

01:25:58.903 --> 01:25:59.987
What would it read?

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:04.908
"Never underestimate
a genius with a chip on his shoulder."

01:27:28.159 --> 01:27:29.993
Shit! What the fuck was that?

01:27:33.998 --> 01:27:36.041
Oh, my God!

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:38.168
Where did that come from?

01:27:39.545 --> 01:27:41.171
Andy.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.506
What?

01:27:43.549 --> 01:27:45.535
Andy's been here.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:47.511
What are you talking about?

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.706
He knows.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:52.599
Then why aren't the police
knocking on the door?

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:55.086
Because he's playing with us.

01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:56.421
- Andy?
- Yes.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:58.021
I don't believe it.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:27:59.257
Believe it.

01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:00.341
How could he possibly...

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.859
Well, let's think about that
for a moment, shall we?

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.638
What could we have done wrong?

01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:07.098
Let's retrace the plan

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:11.519
and see if we can put our finger
on a detail we may have overlooked.

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.396
One of us may have improvised.

01:28:13.496 --> 01:28:16.774
One of us may have decided that
to get pregnant would double the money.

01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:18.234
It did double the money.

01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:20.862
Now I don't want to hear
about it anymore. It is history.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.546
No, no, no kidding.

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.032
It's the present.

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.134
It's the here and the now
and the needle in the haystack.

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.287
Let me ask you something.

01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:31.164
Once he found out he was sterile,

01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:35.293
how long do you think it took him
to figure out there was no Dr. Lillianfield?

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:37.311
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:28:37.937 --> 01:28:40.605
There wasn't supposed to be a baby.

01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.403
I'll take care of Andy.

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:12.846
Don't get up.

01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:18.294
What happened to your face?

01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:19.686
I tripped.

01:29:20.938 --> 01:29:23.591
I heard they caught the guy, the rapist.

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:24.858
Yeah.

01:29:25.276 --> 01:29:27.986
Well, that must be a load off your mind.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.074
Yeah, it's great
to finally have things back to normal.

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:37.204
Andy, they can be back to normal.

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.748
What's that?

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:42.793
Things.

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.379
Our life.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:49.383
Remember me?

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.765
- Tracy.
- What?

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:00.310
I think you dropped your shoe.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:05.524
What can I get you?

01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:08.235
We'll have two glasses of house wine.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.347
- Is chardonnay all right?
- It'll be fine.

01:30:11.447 --> 01:30:13.657
- Anything else?
- Some privacy.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:18.604
Sweetie, I'm going to talk for a minute,

01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:21.706
so it would be better
if you don't interrupt me, okay?

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:25.252
I found a hypodermic needle in my bed.

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:28.839
I don't know who put it there,
it doesn't matter.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:32.968
What matters
is that I didn't think it was funny.

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:36.054
And as you well know,
I've a healthy sense of humor.

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:39.141
So what I'm saying is this.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:45.188
Whoever played that joke is playing
in a league they're just not ready for.

01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:50.318
Now, I came here
hoping we could reach an understanding.

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.891
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
hold a grudge on this one, Trace.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.435
Go to cops. They'll call you crazy.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:00.396
As would Westerly or any another school
at which you try and get a teaching job.

01:31:00.496 --> 01:31:01.481
Happy hunting, Andy.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.582
- Sit the fuck down!
- What?

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.293
I said sit the fuck down.

01:31:07.086 --> 01:31:08.753
I'm running the show now.

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:14.426
You're running it
with an empty hypodermic needle?

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.304
I'm running it
with trace amounts of Pergonal.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.480
Here you go.

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:32.970
Ma'am, would you happen to know
anything about a drug called Pergonal?

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:34.529
I'm sorry.

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.947
Never mind. That's all right.

01:31:38.242 --> 01:31:41.479
It's a fertility drug, Andy.
I was trying to get pregnant.

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:45.916
A fertility drug. That's exactly
what the lab guys told me.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.319
But it turns out that Pergonal,

01:31:48.419 --> 01:31:53.131
when it's injected in, like, massive
quantities will actually create ovarian cysts.

01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:56.911
They gathered brilliant young surgeons
around, Trace,

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.830
'cause you gave us all quite a scare.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:02.208
The hormone dissolved in the ovaries, you
wouldn't have a clue how much I was taking.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:03.642
That's right.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:06.504
It's not like I had a witness.

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:10.174
I mean, if I had a witness
who saw Jed giving you the injections,

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:11.843
then you and doctor man

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:14.345
would be spending
the rest of your sexually-active years

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:17.322
in a place where if you're very, very good,
they'll let you work in the laundry.

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:20.784
You're bluffing.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.562
Tracy.

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:24.856
Right now,
more than anything else in the world,

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.959
don't you wish I had finally gotten around
to putting up the curtains in the bedroom?

01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:31.670
Shit!

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.505
Are you all right?

01:32:35.466 --> 01:32:37.952
- You should run that under some water.
- No, I'm fine.

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:41.429
- Are you sure? Let me just...
- I said I'm fine!

01:32:41.597 --> 01:32:42.764
Jesus!

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.141
You spilled your wine, Trace.

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:49.755
By the by,

01:32:49.855 --> 01:32:54.442
you should know in case some bizarre,
active God should happen to take my life,

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.095
my will's been amended

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:59.990
to direct the police to the 10-year-old son
of our next-door neighbor.

01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:01.491
What do you want?

01:33:03.619 --> 01:33:06.981
What does anybody want?
I want the Red Sox to win the World Series.

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:09.150
You haven't taken the kid to the police.
What do you want?

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.001
I had a chat with your mom.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.672
Not bad looking for somebody
who's been dead for 12 years.

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.843
What do you want, Andy?

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:22.929
I want to change my life, Tracy.

01:33:23.222 --> 01:33:25.124
I don't think
Emma was stating the case either,

01:33:25.224 --> 01:33:27.001
and she knows
some pretty cool card tricks.

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:29.561
Cut the shit! What do you want?

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.147
I want half.

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.858
What the fuck do you think I want?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.692
Give him the money.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.110
What?

01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:56.129
Give the man the money,
and let's get out of here.

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:59.951
Jesus, Jed. Don't fade on me.
I need you to focus on this thing.

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:01.786
I'm telling you precisely what to do.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.789
Give the guy the 10 bucks
and we leave the country.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:08.683
I'm supposed to split the money three ways?
I'm supposed to just accept this?

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:12.771
Welcome to the land
where you don't have a choice.

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:16.509
Don't fucking turn on me.
I earned this money.

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:18.803
This money is mine.
He's not getting a nickel.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.820
They write the check to me.

01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:23.156
Not in prison, they don't.

01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:31.247
Without the kid,
he doesn't have anything.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:35.543
Without the kid, Andy is just a guy
who cracked under the strain.

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.462
What?

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:40.131
Absolutely.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:45.220
Do you know what you're saying?

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.971
What's the big leap, Jed?

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:51.836
You cut me open, stuck your hands in,
twisted my ovaries, so they look all dead.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:53.129
Excuse me, necrotic.

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:55.840
Now you develop some enlightened sense
of what's right and wrong?

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.341
- He's a child.
- No!

01:34:57.441 --> 01:35:01.971
He is a fucking troll who deserves to be put
out of his misery for fucking up my life!

01:35:02.071 --> 01:35:04.114
Now, if you don't have the balls to...

01:35:09.829 --> 01:35:11.538
Don't talk about this again.

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:18.044
Anything happens to the kid,
and I'm the State's star witness.

01:35:19.839 --> 01:35:21.339
Give the man the money.

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.471
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.276
Put it down.

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:46.322
How much blood did you let me lose
before you saved me?

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:49.393
You waited an extra minute or two,
didn't you?

01:35:49.493 --> 01:35:51.812
You thought about going the other way
after you saw I was pregnant.

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:54.690
You thought for a second
about letting me die, didn't you?

01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:57.625
- I'm a doctor.
- You were a doctor.

01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:01.421
Don't overestimate yourself, Tracy.

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.341
Give me the gun.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.596
Come on.

01:37:23.712 --> 01:37:25.505
- Hello?
- It's me.

01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:27.382
I have the money.

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:30.802
- Where are you?
- I'm at Market Square.

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:34.848
Meet me in the northwest corner
in 15 minutes.

01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:10.753
Like shooting tuna in a barrel.

01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:39.532
I won't mind shooting you.

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:45.356
What took you so long?

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:47.290
We were waiting for Jed.

01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:50.543
Somehow, I don't think
he's going to show.

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:52.795
Don't move. You need a doctor.

01:40:54.965 --> 01:40:56.632
You hear that, Trace?

01:40:58.218 --> 01:40:59.594
We need a doctor.

01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:33.271
You okay?

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:35.565
I will be.

01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:40.903
You're supposed to put ice on that.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.781
I don't want any ice.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:46.701
You need ice.

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:48.812
Fine.

01:42:48.912 --> 01:42:51.857
I'll have mine in a glass
with some scotch.

01:42:51.957 --> 01:42:53.040
Fine.

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:55.751
Single malt. Nothing blended.

01:42:56.044 --> 01:42:58.129
Blended whiskey is crap.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:01.257
Somebody told me that once.
