WEBVTT

00:00.209 --> 00:02.044
Previously on Legacy.

00:02.128 --> 00:05.131
Ida, Ida, Ida...

00:05.214 --> 00:07.800
I don't know what I would do without you.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.051
Nor I you, sir.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.177
Sloan, what do you want?

00:10.261 --> 00:13.472
Mr. Vance has shuffled off
this mortal coil.

00:13.556 --> 00:15.474
Your services are no longer needed.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.893
So I combed through
all of Wakefield's texts.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.563
Last week, he sent Rogers
a photo of a blueprint.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.480
A blueprint of what?

00:21.564 --> 00:23.983
A 20x8 rectangular structure.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.025
Any text?

00:25.109 --> 00:26.527
Just the word "Plano."

00:26.610 --> 00:28.696
That's a daisy chain of ANFO blocks.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.698
Ammonium nitrate fuel oil.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.199
They wired up their own tunnel?

00:32.283 --> 00:33.409
It's a kill switch.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.536
Destroy the evidence
with the push of a button.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.580
-So what's the plan?
-Help 'em push it.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.331
It's happening tonight.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.167
How close do I have to get to Aslan
to grab a signal?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.627
You steal the signal,
you toss it to me.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.088
At the right moment,
I toss it to the tunnel.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.006
Kablooey.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.383
-Shit! Intruder!
-Coming your way now.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.010
-Hold it right there!
-You got it?

00:51.093 --> 00:53.262
Got it, got it, got it.
Here comes the hammer.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.221
Boom.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.685
Why don't you quit
beating around the bush

00:59.769 --> 01:01.145
and tell me what you have in mind?

01:01.228 --> 01:04.565
You walk into the U.S. Attorney's office
and confess.

01:04.648 --> 01:05.941
To what?

01:06.025 --> 01:07.818
You give them everything you know
about the Bratva

01:07.902 --> 01:09.987
and hope that gets you some leniency.

01:10.070 --> 01:10.905
Deal.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.628
Mr. Kading.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.797
I apologize for the late hour.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.382
Check your client in to Club Fed?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.509
Snug as a bug.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.762
So what can I do for you,
Mr. Kading?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.096
Here's the thing.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.392
I don't trust the U.S. Attorney.
That office hates my guts.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.853
They're gonna squeeze Carl
for everything he knows,

01:42.937 --> 01:46.023
and then find some technicality
to renege on the deal.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.566
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.903
Look, you call the U.S. Attorney,
he picks up the phone.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.863
Me, not so much.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.365
What do you want me to say?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.991
Well, I want assurances.

01:56.075 --> 01:59.912
I want him to stay in the safe house
for as long as possible.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.499
I don't want the Feds asking the judge
to send him back to prison

02:03.582 --> 02:04.959
the minute he walks in the courthouse.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.961
He'll be a sitting duck.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.172
Okay, this is me wiping away a tear.

02:10.256 --> 02:14.093
Just deliver Rodgers,
do what the Feds tell you to do,

02:14.176 --> 02:15.469
and don't be late.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.475
Bitch.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.990
All right. You mind?
I need to see my client.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.241
I'll escort you.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.785
The fuck you will. Privacy, please.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.251
Hey.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.211
-Thought you were room service.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.463
I'm glad you still have
that special sense of humor.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.844
I'm glad this dump is temporary
'cause it has bed bugs.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.431
Oh. Yeah, I'll speak to them about that.

03:03.893 --> 03:05.561
Well?

03:05.644 --> 03:06.937
Just be on time.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.815
Our friend has the seal.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.241
That's it?

03:19.325 --> 03:21.243
That's more than enough.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.788
Well, it better be.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.119
Makes me sick to my stomach
he might be getting a sentencing break.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.788
Carl Rogers is confessing
to paying for four murders.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.124
How lenient can the court be?

04:50.207 --> 04:53.210
At his age,
he's going away for the rest of his life.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.879
Still, it feels like
he's getting away with it.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.133
We're talking about
a few minor privileges.

04:59.216 --> 05:03.220
An extra hour of exercise,
maybe access to the prison library.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.348
Mostly, the government guarantees
that he keeps breathing.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.058
That's what I'm talking about.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.602
He's getting away with it.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.438
No one says it's perfect, Maddie.

05:13.522 --> 05:17.985
But it is as much justice as we can get
given the circumstances.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.075
This is where Detective Robertson
interviewed me the day you were shot.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.496
Mm.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.749
Thought you were gonna die.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.918
And yet here we are. Still here.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.380
Thanks to you.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.308
Jasmine.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.519
Do I know you?

05:52.603 --> 05:54.104
Friend of Carl's.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.732
I was just on my way out.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.901
-Two minutes.
-Let's go inside.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.903
-We can talk out here.
-Inside.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.209
I haven't seen Carl in days.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.419
Be precise.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.464
Tuesday night. We had dinner at Jar.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.886
Nothing since?

06:27.471 --> 06:30.015
Son of a bitch hasn't answered my calls
or my texts.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.391
I don't believe.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.393
Check it if you don't believe me.

06:45.072 --> 06:50.410
Pretty girls always think
they have benefit of doubt.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.372
But not always.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.007
You love your parents?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.345
Yes.

07:08.428 --> 07:13.517
Joe. Diane.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.018
Dana Point.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.275
I swear.
I don't know where he is.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.114
Please.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.041
Cockroach doesn't deserve you.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.715
We crush him for you.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.083
All teams, perimeter check.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.046
Southwest perimeter clear.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.762
You guys must be exhausted.
Out here all night.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.348
That's the job.
What are you gonna do?

08:34.431 --> 08:37.309
I just brewed a fresh pot.
How about a cup?

08:37.392 --> 08:39.394
Does smell good.

08:39.478 --> 08:43.565
Come get some.
Help you push through that last few.

08:45.108 --> 08:45.943
Sure.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.402
Whatever.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.696
Use your bathroom?

08:49.780 --> 08:50.614
Absolutely.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.746
According to your pal Gustafson,

08:57.829 --> 09:00.415
"Herstadt slipped through the cracks
in the justice system."

09:00.499 --> 09:02.125
Those cracks being you and me.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.711
He just can't admit he was wrong.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.797
Meantime, no one's looking
for the real killer.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.090
You volunteering?

09:08.173 --> 09:09.091
Somebody has to.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.509
I agree.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.513
I wanna look at the discovery materials
from the case.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.808
There is one problem with that.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.769
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
It's privileged.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.479
And since you don't work for me,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.899
which you've made perfectly clear
on several occasions...

09:27.484 --> 09:31.446
I want you to take this.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.283
I'm paying you
to conduct an investigation

09:34.366 --> 09:37.327
in support of a petition
for factual innocence.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.122
If you believe
Jeffrey Herstadt is innocent

09:40.205 --> 09:43.500
and that the killer
of Dr. Basu remains at large.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.711
I do.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.838
No one has to know.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.393
Baba.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.608
Come here.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.280
What do we know?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.365
No sign of him.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.534
His whore hasn't seen him, either.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.827
So, let's order.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.581
No. Let's get to work.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.624
Long flight. You must be hungry.

10:24.708 --> 10:28.128
Russian food I can get in Russia.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.546
Baba. Don't you want a bite first?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.298
Let's find this scumbag.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.175
Then we'll feast like Vikings.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.177
Tommy's. Chili cheeseburger.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.471
Original Tommy's. Original.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.472
Original.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.431
Of course.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.770
Oh, come in.
I'm just finishing up an email.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.735
I think that's a blueprint
of a shipping container.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.903
How do you figure?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.280
Wakefield had an app on his phone
called Voyage.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.157
It's a cargo tracking system.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.785
It shows real-time status
of global shipments.

10:59.868 --> 11:00.702
That seven-digit number?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.496
A tracking number?

11:02.579 --> 11:03.955
I typed it in the app.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.252
Huh. Two shipping containers.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.339
South Bay. One in Long Beach,
one in Wilmington.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.883
Both scheduled
to be picked up this afternoon.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.806
Jesus H. Christ.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.475
What happened here?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.609
Fucking rookies.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.819
No sign of him.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.031
Fuck me.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.791
Holy fucking shit!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.209
Counselor.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.710
What's this about?

11:50.794 --> 11:54.256
Don't start with lie. Truth only.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.550
Once chance.

11:58.009 --> 12:03.974
Where in fucking world
is Carl Rogers? Hmm?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.406
Bad news. Carl Rogers is in the wind.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032
How the hell did that happen?

12:21.116 --> 12:23.160
He walked out of the front door
and disappeared.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.162
Where were his minders?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.581
Unconscious. Drugged, apparently.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.999
Have you talked to his attorney?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.501
Kading? He's MIA as well.

12:31.585 --> 12:35.630
How fast can you file on Rogers?
Get a warrant for his arrest.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.548
We're working on it.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.258
He could flee the country.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.593
Then the Feds will extradite him.

12:39.676 --> 12:43.263
That blueprint off Wakefield's phone.
Matthew did some legwork.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.806
It's a shipping container.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.516
Plano is an export company.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.894
There was a tracking number
just activated

12:48.977 --> 12:51.396
for a pick-up
of two containers this afternoon.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.564
Being delivered to where?

12:52.647 --> 12:55.108
San Pedro.
A ship headed to Vietnam,

12:55.192 --> 12:57.319
which has no extradition treaty
with the U.S.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.403
I looked it up.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.821
Where are the containers now?

12:59.905 --> 13:02.240
One's in Wilmington,
the other is Long Beach.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.450
We need to go now.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.785
You take Long Beach.
I'll text you the info.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.204
You shouldn't go alone.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.498
Screw that. I'm headed to Wilmington.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.386
Help you?

14:46.469 --> 14:47.512
Hope so.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.808
John Creighton. Trident Security.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.976
Is there a problem?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.811
Nothing we can't fix.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.316
Chanson Trucking's a client.
They're picking up a box.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.109
Dipshit driver forgot the seal.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.821
So I had to come all the way down here
myself to sort this shit out.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.451
Maybe I could slip one on,
save us all a headache with customs.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.660
You got the I.D. number?

15:10.744 --> 15:12.746
-Just the tracking.
-Let's see.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.838
Sorry, pal, looks like they
already got it. About an hour ago.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.173
Shit.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.966
It's one of those modified containers.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.510
With inspections and all,
driver probably wanted a head start.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.055
Modified, huh?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.656
Appreciate you showing me.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.283
Always wanted to see
how these boxes got modified.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.826
We import most of them from China,

15:51.910 --> 15:54.079
then tailor them
to the clients' specifications.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.164
-What kind of specs?
-Depends on what they want.

15:56.247 --> 16:00.335
We usually outfit them
with two sides. Freezer, cooling. Here.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.046
That little room's the freezer.
This here's the cooling.

16:03.129 --> 16:03.963
Ventilation?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.341
Fresh air exchange.
Evaporator fan.

16:06.424 --> 16:10.136
It's all insulated, so once you set
the temperature, it holds.

16:10.220 --> 16:14.474
Ritzy. Guy's asking about
one of the Planos.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.351
Got picked up earlier.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.519
Oh, that one.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.604
What do you mean?
Was it any different?

16:19.688 --> 16:23.775
Kinda. They didn't want a freezer unit,
just A/C and a thermostat.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.737
I called the trucking company.
It's already on the ship.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.655
Can we get on?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.031
Not without a warrant.

16:30.115 --> 16:33.910
With customs, once it's in port,
good luck.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.829
All right, I'm calling the U.S. Attorney.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.915
They'll put out a red notice.
That goes out globally.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.667
If Rogers is in a fucking container,

16:40.750 --> 16:43.336
they'll catch him
on the other side in Vietnam.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.629
You heading back?

16:44.713 --> 16:45.755
I can come your way.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.259
No, don't bother. It looks like
they picked up the one here too.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.096
Uh, I think I'm gonna wander a little bit.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.515
I'll, uh, I'll let you know
if I find anything.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.599
Roger that.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.675
Son of a bitch.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.561
Adios, asshole.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.356
The world's a better place.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.903
No question.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.530
A little justice.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.157
He got what he deserved.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.330
If those Russians had caught me...

22:52.413 --> 22:54.040
Be on your way to Hanoi too.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.960
Where do you think they are?

22:58.044 --> 23:02.673
My bet? They're gone.
On the red-eye back to Moscow.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.763
Goes without saying.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.058
This stays between us.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.267
Absolutely.

23:13.351 --> 23:14.477
Especially Maddie.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.062
Goes without saying.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.735
Ah.

23:24.946 --> 23:25.780
Night.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.241
Goodnight, Harry.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.628
Still on for tomorrow?

23:40.711 --> 23:44.048
Yes, please. I need a night off.
No cop talk.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.258
Maybe a little bit.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.052
Yeah, maybe a little venting,
a little whining.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.806
All right, Boots, listen up.
Last chance for a spot on the team.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.475
You know the drill.
A quick 10K through the park.

23:54.559 --> 23:58.604
Time to beat is- 55 for men,
- 31 for women.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.815
Let's make Hollywood Division proud.

24:02.733 --> 24:03.651
So I have a question.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.778
10K is like six something miles.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.613
Yeah, 6.2 and change.

24:07.697 --> 24:09.699
And Baker to Vegas is 120 miles.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.658
Yeah, through the desert.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.244
-So that's like five marathons.
-Right.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.537
So are you, like, fucking kidding me?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.664
It's a team sport.

24:16.747 --> 24:19.250
Paulina, it's a relay race
over two days and nights.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.128
Nobody runs the whole thing.
That would be impossible.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.547
-I was gonna say.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.174
Got it in you, Bosch?

24:26.257 --> 24:27.258
A 10K?

24:28.926 --> 24:29.802
Standing on my head.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.137
Counting on it.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.435
Ready and...

24:40.438 --> 24:42.690
Let's go, guys.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.004
You heard about Rogers?

25:47.088 --> 25:50.007
A lot of egg
on a lot of Federal faces.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.093
His attorney's missing too.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.720
That doesn't bode well for either of them.

25:54.804 --> 25:59.392
So his criminal case is on hold
until he turns up.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.935
If he turns up.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.728
Going ahead with the civil suit?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.355
I need to talk to my client.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.399
Well, she can still get a verdict at trial

26:06.482 --> 26:09.026
and a possible judgement
against Roger's estate,

26:09.110 --> 26:10.861
if they can find it.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.196
Worth a try.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.955
All right, let's go. Do it.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.832
Nice hustle.
Way to push through at the end.

26:22.915 --> 26:26.002
-What's the verdict?
-51. Just missed it.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.588
Damn it. I knew I should have
pushed harder at the beginning.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.382
One of the five alternates,
if you want it.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.927
Uh, I don't know.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.513
Hear the party in Vegas is epic.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.016
Be a shame not to see you
bust some moves on the dance floor.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.101
I'll think about it.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.319
Oh, that sucked.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.112
Yeah, you could say that again.

26:53.195 --> 26:57.950
That sucked. Whoo!

26:58.034 --> 27:00.619
This is off-the-charts weird.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.747
What we have here
is a holographic will.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.333
-Holographic?
-Handwritten.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.250
Is that a problem?

27:06.334 --> 27:07.877
Not per se.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.505
In California, holographic wills
are accepted as legal instruments

27:11.589 --> 27:12.631
upon verification.

27:12.715 --> 27:14.008
Vance must have known that.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.760
Well, that's why he sent you the pen.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.472
"Last Will and Testament
of Whitney Vance.

27:19.555 --> 27:22.266
Hieronymus Bosch,
sole executor."

27:23.392 --> 27:25.811
Congratulations.
You must have done a good job for him.

27:25.895 --> 27:28.522
It's not finished.
He may have an heir.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.150
Well, who else knows you have this?

27:31.233 --> 27:36.155
Vance's letter says he directed his
secretary, Ida, to send me the package.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.074
I wonder if she knows what's in it.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.369
Well, she is.
To the tune of $10 million.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.578
No kidding.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.456
Was it certified? I mean,
did you have to sign for it?

27:45.539 --> 27:49.335
No, it was just stuffed in the box
with all the junk mail.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.337
Maybe the best way to get it to you
under the radar.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.966
The last time you saw Vance,
was he of sound mind and body

27:56.050 --> 27:57.343
as he attests here?

27:57.426 --> 27:58.761
Yeah, he was.

27:59.845 --> 28:00.846
What do we do next?

28:00.930 --> 28:03.849
Nothing, for now.
We lie low and wait.

28:03.933 --> 28:07.645
You keep working your case.
Confirm Vance has an heir.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.731
We see who makes a move,
see what the corporation does.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.609
When they make their move,
we make our move.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.570
But we have to safeguard the originals
at all costs.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.906
We need to make copies. Decoys.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.200
And what about this?
You sure it's the same one?

28:21.283 --> 28:22.576
As far as I know.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.497
All right, we need Ida to confirm it.
Verification every step of the way.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.207
Chain of authenticity.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.419
His pen,
his signature in the pen's ink.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.129
Got it.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.966
Billions of dollars on the line.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.219
People will do anything
to get their hands on it.

28:40.302 --> 28:43.389
That's what Mr. Vance said
when I took this job.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.696
-Hey, big dog.
-Mm. Harry.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.324
What's the good word?

29:05.161 --> 29:06.162
Undetermined.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.374
Really? He's 88 years old.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.542
Tell me about it.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.086
If the word "billionaire"
wasn't part of his name,

29:14.170 --> 29:16.172
he wouldn't even have gotten an autopsy.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.506
What's the red flag?

29:17.590 --> 29:20.134
Slight petechial hemorrhaging.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.677
So not natural causes.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.805
As of now,
Ventura's not ready to call it.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.349
Could be foul play.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.685
That's your area of expertise.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.688
Used to be.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.495
You see that?

29:47.578 --> 29:49.788
-Got it.
-What's the vehicle code section?

29:49.872 --> 29:51.582
Twenty-two, four-fifty, A.

29:51.665 --> 29:52.666
Call out the plate.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.545
California license plate.
Three Tom Henry Ocean four seven nine.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.799
It's clean. Light him up.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.005
-Freeze! Hey!

30:56.438 --> 30:59.191
Shots fired!
Shots fired! My partner is down!

30:59.275 --> 31:00.192
Oh, fuck.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.324
I'm going.

31:07.408 --> 31:10.619
Everybody in the station.
Officer down. Officer needs help.

31:10.703 --> 31:13.289
- Ivar and Dix Street. Officer down.
-Shit. You got this?

31:13.372 --> 31:16.584
What are you waiting for?
Go. Go, go.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.336
Six-Adam-Forty-Five.
Officer needs help. Shots fired.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.504
Shots fired. My partner is down.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.799
Six-A-Forty-Five. Six-A-Forty-Five.
Oh, my God. Paulina.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.636
Your partner rolled to the scene?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.221
Yeah, I'm gonna catch a ride
with somebody else.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.682
Another officer's
gonna add to the chaos.

31:31.765 --> 31:32.766
So you want me to stay here, then?

31:32.850 --> 31:33.684
Another set of hands.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.686
Go see Sergeant Mankiewicz.
He'll give you your assignment.

31:35.769 --> 31:36.812
Sir.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.399
ETA on the RA. My partner's
breathing, but she's unconscious.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.776
It's bad. It's bad.

32:14.642 --> 32:18.520
Okay, listen.
RHD is going out to tell the family.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.730
Poor parents.

32:19.813 --> 32:23.067
When her folks open that door,

32:23.150 --> 32:25.986
I don't think they should
learn about this from strangers.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.489
You want me to make notification?

32:29.615 --> 32:32.868
Be the liaison.
You're there if the family needs you.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.621
I don't--
I don't know them.

32:35.704 --> 32:39.291
But you know Paulina.
She's your fellow officer, right?

32:43.587 --> 32:44.421
Mankiewicz.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.383
Yeah.

32:49.510 --> 32:50.719
All right, put him through.

33:02.106 --> 33:05.150
This is Larry Magill.
We're following breaking news.

33:05.234 --> 33:09.446
An LAPD officer has been shot
following a traffic stop in Hollywood.

33:09.530 --> 33:14.201
Sources tell us the wounded officer
is a rookie female patrol cop.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.119
Fuck!

33:15.202 --> 33:18.038
The incident occurred near
the intersection of Yucca Street

33:18.122 --> 33:20.833
and Wilcox Avenue
approximately ten minutes ago.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.543
No, no, no, no.

33:22.626 --> 33:26.213
Pick up. Pick up. Come on, Maddie.
Please, pick up.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.094
Dad.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.138
Mads. Are you okay?

33:34.221 --> 33:37.099
I'm okay. Just shaken up.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.267
What happened?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.227
She's one of my classmates, Dad.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.229
God. How bad?

33:42.312 --> 33:44.356
Um, I'm hearing it's not good.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.401
Where are you?
Are you at the scene? At the hospital?

33:47.484 --> 33:48.652
At the station.

33:48.736 --> 33:49.737
Listen.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.990
They want me to help make notification.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.033
What do I say?

34:08.088 --> 34:09.715
You'll find the words.

34:13.093 --> 34:13.927
I love you.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.972
I love you too.
Keep me posted.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.390
I promise.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.516
Bye.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.978
...as the story develops,
but in the meantime, officers...

34:27.399 --> 34:28.817
Jesus.

34:43.624 --> 34:46.668
This shit ends now.
These fucking people never give up.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.057
What's the plan?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.059
The plan?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.727
You've done this before.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.521
And it never gets easier.

35:49.940 --> 35:55.237
All right, don't overthink it.
Just tell them what we know, all right?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.205
Mrs. Calderon.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.623
Yes, that's me.

36:06.707 --> 36:09.084
Detective Dorsey.
Officer Bosch.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.669
Ma'am, there's been an incident.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.881
Please tell me she's okay.

36:13.964 --> 36:15.841
Can we step inside, ma'am?
We'll give you the details.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.467
What happened?

36:18.385 --> 36:19.887
Officer Calderon
was involved in a shooting.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.556
Oh, my God.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.976
She's alive.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.352
Paulina's alive.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.104
Were you with her?

36:29.187 --> 36:32.524
No, but your daughter's
been taken to Cedars-Sinai hospital.

36:32.608 --> 36:34.443
She's being treated.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.236
Take me to her, please.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.267
Having trouble following me?
Want a copy my itinerary?

37:07.351 --> 37:09.561
Where'd you burn us, at the bank?

37:09.645 --> 37:10.938
What do you want, Creighton?

37:11.021 --> 37:12.522
I want you to stand down.

37:12.606 --> 37:13.774
Stand down from what?

37:13.857 --> 37:16.985
Your employer died.
Your employment's terminated.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.656
Speaking for the corporation,
stop what you're doing.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.409
We even know what your attorney's doing.
We've been watching you.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.079
I'll take it under advisement.

37:28.288 --> 37:31.124
I don't think you understand
the position you're in.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.502
Oh, yeah? What position is that?

37:36.254 --> 37:40.467
You're on very dangerous ground.
You need to make careful decisions.

37:41.551 --> 37:45.013
I represent people who reward those
who make careful decisions.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.558
You know what,
that sounds like a threat or a bribe,

37:48.642 --> 37:49.559
or maybe both.

37:49.643 --> 37:50.936
Take it any way you want.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.479
If I were still a cop,

37:52.562 --> 37:55.357
I'd arrest you for threatening an officer
and attempted bribery.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.319
But you're not.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.156
Wonder if she'll come back.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.536
I wouldn't blame her if she didn't.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.331
Having second thoughts?

38:53.415 --> 38:54.708
About the job?

38:54.791 --> 38:56.835
Wouldn't blame you if you were.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.128
No.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.339
I was just wondering.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.343
How she's doing,
what went wrong.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.596
Maybe she did everything right
and it still went wrong.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.267
That's a sobering thought.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.352
Yeah, it is. But shit happens.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.274
You got shot and came back.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.442
I did.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.864
You never talk about it.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.950
'Cause it's not that interesting.
Maybe some other time, Mads.

39:32.871 --> 39:38.668
I wanna know what it felt like.
I wanna know what she's going through.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.470
I was part
of an LAPD FBI joint task force.

39:48.553 --> 39:52.140
We were working a string
of bank robberies and murders.

39:52.224 --> 39:56.520
Bad guys were using the tunnels that run
under the city to pull off their capers.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.605
Oh, man, that sounds
like something out of a movie.

39:58.688 --> 39:59.773
Yeah.

40:00.607 --> 40:01.441
Is that--?

40:03.902 --> 40:07.155
Needless to say,
they completely fucked it up.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.824
That's how you bought the house.

40:08.907 --> 40:09.991
Yeah.

40:11.243 --> 40:14.287
I could use another windfall about now,
fix it up.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.290
Maybe somebody will do a remake.

40:19.626 --> 40:20.460
Anyway...

40:20.544 --> 40:24.631
Yeah, anyway,
so we finally catch him in the act, right?

40:25.674 --> 40:28.176
Downtown bank. Big shootout.

40:28.260 --> 40:33.223
Killed two, captured two,
and two slip off into the tunnels.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.059
So I go in after 'em.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.644
Why didn't you wait for backup?

40:37.727 --> 40:40.272
No time.
They would have escaped.

40:40.355 --> 40:43.900
Dad, if I did something like that,
you would pitch a fit.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.652
Do as I say, not as I do.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.656
My partner knew where I was.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.324
You wanna hear
the rest of the story or not?

40:51.408 --> 40:54.786
So you're tracking the bad guys...

40:54.870 --> 40:56.788
Down in the tunnel,

40:56.872 --> 41:01.793
looking around with my flashlight,
for a while, it feels like hours.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.629
No idea where they are.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.091
And then I trip over one 'em.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.634
Oh, man, how scary is that?

41:09.718 --> 41:12.095
Well, he's dead, right.
Wounded in the shootout.

41:13.722 --> 41:19.686
So I move past him and I'm
going around the bend in the tunnel,

41:19.769 --> 41:22.230
and his partner is waiting there for me.

41:24.191 --> 41:25.025
One shot.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.820
Sounded like a fucking cannon.

41:28.904 --> 41:31.448
Hit me like a freight train.
Knocked me on my ass.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.826
Shattered my shoulder blade,
collarbone.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.036
Did it hurt?

41:36.119 --> 41:37.245
Hurt like a bastard.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.832
So I started going into shock.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.084
Daddy. Holy shit.

41:43.168 --> 41:47.964
I heard footsteps. This fucker
is coming back to finish me off.

41:52.219 --> 41:56.181
So I'm lying there
and I'm thinking holy shit, right?

41:57.891 --> 42:01.937
Is this it? Is this where it ends?
Is this is where I buy it?

42:03.688 --> 42:07.567
On my back and in a fucking sewer.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.488
I close my eyes.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.450
Then two shots.

42:15.533 --> 42:19.371
Bad guy falls down dead
right next to me.

42:20.372 --> 42:25.001
And then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, like an angel,

42:25.085 --> 42:29.130
I hear this woman's voice
telling me everything is gonna be okay.

42:31.591 --> 42:32.842
Your FBI partner.

42:34.636 --> 42:35.887
That's right.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.389
Eleanor Wish.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.557
Your mother.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.186
Fuck, she saved your life.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.107
She did.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.817
Is that why you married her?

42:50.235 --> 42:54.114
That and I'd already
fallen in love with her.

42:55.532 --> 42:56.574
I just didn't know it yet.

43:17.012 --> 43:18.054
I miss your view.

43:23.727 --> 43:24.728
I miss her too.

44:10.190 --> 44:12.692
-J. Edgar.
-Harry.

44:14.778 --> 44:16.029
Great to see you, brother.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.990
Good to see you.
You look good.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.201
-Can I get that in writing?

44:21.284 --> 44:22.577
How's RHD?

44:22.660 --> 44:25.205
Busy. This cop shooting.

44:25.288 --> 44:26.206
You working it?

44:26.289 --> 44:29.334
All hands on deck.
You remember.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.086
Yeah, I do.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.629
How's Maddie doing?

44:32.712 --> 44:34.297
She's holding up.

44:34.381 --> 44:35.715
She know the officer?

44:35.799 --> 44:36.883
They were in the academy together.

44:36.966 --> 44:39.594
That's rough. Give her my love.

44:39.677 --> 44:40.553
Will do.

44:40.637 --> 44:42.764
This for me?

44:42.847 --> 44:44.849
I'll reach out when I need it back.

44:44.933 --> 44:47.143
I'll book it into evidence
for one of my cases.

44:47.227 --> 44:48.228
It'll be safe.

44:49.813 --> 44:50.814
Great to see you, brother.

44:52.357 --> 44:54.818
Good to see you too, brother.
Be safe.

44:54.901 --> 44:55.902
You too.
