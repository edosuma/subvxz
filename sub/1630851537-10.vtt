WEBVTT

00:16.808 --> 00:17.726
Wow.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.602
That was amazing.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.604
Yeah, it really was.

00:24.482 --> 00:28.236
Grant, I have to admit...

00:30.071 --> 00:32.449
I have been dreaming about this moment.

00:32.532 --> 00:36.327
Me too. Can't believe it finally happened.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.166
Are you ready for a Monday muffin
morning? Oh, my God!

00:41.249 --> 00:43.710
-I can explain.
-Yeah. We can explain.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.087
I didn't know you liked each other.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.465
It was unplanned. It just happened.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.468
We were in the gym.
Grant fixed my writer's block.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.887
-And we had sex.
-Not helping Grant.

00:54.471 --> 00:58.975
We were finally SBFFs, and now
you're having sex with my ex-boyfriend?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.478
-How could you?
-I am so sorry.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.272
Please believe me.
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.816
I stress-wrote about it in my journal.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.323
Why can't I open this?

01:14.157 --> 01:17.202
-It's locked. I need the key.
-You mean this key?

01:17.285 --> 01:19.621
How do you--? Why do you--?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.748
I have the key. Don't you see?

01:22.165 --> 01:23.041
Hee-hee-hee.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.167
Did you just change?

01:24.250 --> 01:28.088
You're the one that changed
from a good sister to a bad sister.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.255
Et tu, Brute?

01:30.423 --> 01:32.801
Now you're referencing Shakespeare?

01:32.884 --> 01:33.760
Who's Brootay?

01:37.388 --> 01:38.223
Me?

01:38.807 --> 01:40.350
Me Brute!

01:40.433 --> 01:42.894
How could you do this to your sister?

01:42.977 --> 01:46.314
How could you lie
about not being on Instagram?

01:46.397 --> 01:49.734
I can't believe you would do this,
Chelsea. Chelsea.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.279
-Chelsea. Chelsea. Chelsea.
-Chels.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.034
Who's ready for a Monday muffin morning?

02:01.621 --> 02:02.497
Cheers.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.305
-Oh, good, you're up.
-No. No, no.

02:25.311 --> 02:29.065
-Who is it?
-It's Grant. From one second ago?

02:29.607 --> 02:30.441
Can I come in?

02:31.359 --> 02:32.610
Okay, fine.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.781
Hi.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.200
So...

02:41.327 --> 02:44.581
-I wanted to talk about last night.
-Nothing happened.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.876
Yeah, but something almost happened.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.880
What did I say about making
promises you can't keep?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.182
Is anybody still here?

03:03.558 --> 03:07.187
Hey, guys. What time is it?
I fell asleep in the sauna again.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.568
-Gary, are you okay?
-Oh, please, don't worry about me.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.861
I'll be fine.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.034
And the towel's off.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.371
Okay, something almost happened.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.374
But thankfully we were interrupted.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.795
-Thankfully?
-I mean, yes, thankfully.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.841
It was an uncontrolled,
ill-thought-out moment of passion.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.718
I let my emotions get the best of me.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.056
It would have been bad if we kissed.
It's good it didn't happen.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.183
I don't understand.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.855
Grant, Claire and I have gotten
our relationship to a good place.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.275
We eat muffins in bed together
every Monday morning.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.110
And I look forward to it.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.989
I eat chili dogs in bed.
What's the problem?

04:02.450 --> 04:03.701
The problem is...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.664
you used to date my sister.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.375
This can't happen, okay? I'm sorry.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.337
Can't we at least talk about it?
Last night felt like more than--

04:14.420 --> 04:16.589
I'm sorry. I have to get to work.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.725
I still don't quite understand
how Backgammon works.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.769
And yet you're kicking my ass.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.524
-Have you seen my left sock?
-Aren't both the same?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.693
Yeah, but there's one I prefer on my left,

04:36.776 --> 04:39.362
and the other I prefer to wear
on my right.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.824
Is that weird?
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.868
Ah. There's Lefty.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.746
Oh, got something under here.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.207
What is this?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.086
Oh. Um...

05:02.343 --> 05:04.137
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.346
It's all good.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.270
I don't think that's gonna work.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.438
Probably not.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.357
Hi.

05:16.941 --> 05:17.900
Um...

05:18.901 --> 05:19.944
I'm Grant.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.822
Claire.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.283
It's just, uh...

05:26.284 --> 05:30.121
Dirty laundry. It must have
slipped under there by accident.

05:30.204 --> 05:34.625
The stain is bad. Hate to break it
to you, but you need to let this one go.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.045
Right.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.133
I get it. I'm trying to get a stain out
of a shirt from a night at Red Lobster.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.470
Those bibs don't protect everything.

05:46.929 --> 05:47.889
Yeah, totally.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.982
-Morning, Jayden. How are you?
-I know, right?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.361
Any plans today?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.946
Don't listen to them.
You look great, babe.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.826
-That's not what I asked.
-I'm good with anything but sushi.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.121
Oh, hey, Solana.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.168
Jayden. Put your phone down.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.003
You look like me when I took ayahuasca

06:19.087 --> 06:21.005
and stared at the microwave
for three days.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.298
You need a break.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.551
I'm taking a break right now.
Yeah, having a smoothie.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.639
Anyway, Claire, gotta run.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.268
Jayden, are you okay?

06:35.436 --> 06:37.438
Has that chair always been there?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.568
-Jayden, this is getting out of hand.
-I know. You're right.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.405
I walked into a glass door last night.
Not a clear one.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.534
A stained glass door at a cathedral-themed
bar called Sinners and Taints.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.788
I'm putting you on a digital cleanse.
No more phone for the day.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.289
I can't do that.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.460
Being on my phone is my job and my life.
It's why I keep chargers hidden

06:59.544 --> 07:02.797
throughout the city
from bushes to Porta Potties.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.799
Plus, what about my followers?

07:04.882 --> 07:07.593
I have to keep them engaged
or I'll lose them to Logan Paul.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.762
He's not dead like we were hoping.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.224
I can handle your accounts for the day.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.310
I'll thumbs-up the encouraging
comments, heart the flirty messages,

07:16.394 --> 07:18.229
and screengrab the racist ones.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.440
You know my system.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.943
I don't know. Are you sure?

07:24.527 --> 07:28.239
Jayden, I think I can handle
an influencer's socials.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.991
I passed the bar on two hours' sleep

07:30.074 --> 07:33.703
and cured LeBron James' fear
of public speaking through Reiki.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.414
Okay.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.166
Okay.

07:38.666 --> 07:42.420
But I'm warning you.
This thing, this life that I live,

07:43.713 --> 07:44.881
it sucks you in.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.300
I'll be fine.

07:49.302 --> 07:53.014
Well, it does feel really good to put
my arms down at my sides.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.183
They're so long.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.768
Can you take a picture of me like this?

07:57.852 --> 08:00.813
Actually, I'll take it myself.
Give me my phone.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.399
-No.
-Give me my phone!

08:04.692 --> 08:08.279
I'm taking this out of the house.
You can't be trusted.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.954
-Hey, Jayden.
-Have these walls always been this color?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.499
I don't know.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.794
You think something is one color,
and then someone says it's different.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.297
Even though you're sure it was the first.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.925
Huh?

08:29.884 --> 08:30.801
Hey, guys.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.053
Hey, Dave.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.137
What's going on?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.347
I don't know, Dave.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.641
Could be hot goss
on the Stranger Things kids.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.519
Could be nuclear war.
I have no way to find out!

08:42.271 --> 08:43.648
A text from my parents.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.860
Their flights got all messed up,
and they'll be in L.A. for the night.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.946
Your parents are here?

08:51.447 --> 08:57.078
Hey, Claire, I know it's last-minute,
but would you go to dinner with my folks?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.704
I'd love to introduce you.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.332
Your parents?

09:02.124 --> 09:02.959
Uh...

09:03.417 --> 09:06.128
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Awesome.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.298
I've told my mom all about you.
She'll be so excited.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.760
My dad will order the salmon
and immediately regret it.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.597
Meeting the parents. Big step.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.561
This is good news. I gotta head out.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.478
Oh, me too.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.897
-See you tonight.
-Okay, great.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.868
Don't worry. Everyone gets nervous
to meet the parents.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.704
They made a movie series about it.

09:39.787 --> 09:44.250
I haven't seen the movies, but I'm sure
they get along and nothing goes wrong.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.712
You're right. I just...

09:49.505 --> 09:52.592
-I don't know what to wear.
-I'll help you.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.304
And not just because Solana took my phone
and I'm bored out of my mind,

09:56.387 --> 09:58.723
but also 'cause I love you.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.350
It's like an 80-20 situation.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.358
You're not on the schedule today.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.903
Oh, no, am I dreaming?
Please keep your clothes on.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.532
What? No. I'm just here to talk to you.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.619
Okay. Well, I'm really busy.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.955
The lost and found is bonkers today.
Somebody lost their grandfather.

10:23.039 --> 10:27.460
They didn't lose me. I'm just waiting
for my grandson to finish working out.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.128
Oh.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.464
My mistake. Sorry, sir.

10:32.214 --> 10:36.427
Look, for me, Chelsea, last night
wasn't just a flash in the pants.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.265
What I'm trying to say is...

10:43.059 --> 10:43.934
I like you.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.898
It's that simple.
I can't make those feelings go away.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.943
I thought you liked me too.
Was I wrong about that?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.156
No, you're right. I do like you.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.493
-Nice.
-Okay, but there's more to it than just--

11:00.576 --> 11:02.787
I know you have concerns
about us being together,

11:02.870 --> 11:05.956
but Claire and I are ancient history.
Like the 1990s.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.961
She's so happy with Dave.
She made plans to meet his parents.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.297
Wow.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.676
-Wow, that's huge for Claire.
-Exactly.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.430
But it doesn't change the fact that
you guys dated, and she's my sister,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.308
and that just feels kind of wrong, right?

11:24.392 --> 11:25.726
She does have a point.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.438
If one of my brothers told me they liked

11:29.522 --> 11:32.525
someone I dated three years ago
and no longer had feelings for,

11:32.608 --> 11:35.861
I'd say, "Go for it,
Stephen or Lance or Jericho."

11:35.945 --> 11:39.198
It seems like
such an awkward conversation.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.118
If it's okay with you,
I can talk to Claire.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.285
No, no.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.246
Oh, come on. Let him do it.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.291
I should be the one that talks to her.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.420
And we're back, baby. Hell yes!

11:55.381 --> 11:59.301
I guess I gotta just rip off
the Band-Aid and be honest with her.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
So you're gonna do it?

12:01.595 --> 12:05.182
Yeah, I just need to figure out
what I'm gonna say.

12:05.808 --> 12:10.146
Between the romance and all the butts,
I'm never leaving this gym.

12:13.774 --> 12:17.695
Thanks for using
the @JadenJayJMichaelJiang offer code,

12:17.778 --> 12:19.613
and... post.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.408
You're really great at this.

12:22.491 --> 12:26.162
Jayden never responds to my comments,
but you were right on it.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.874
Now, if Jayden would only follow me back?

12:32.918 --> 12:36.172
I'm not sure why Jayden
gets so sucked into his socials.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.465
It's pretty easy to manage.

12:39.216 --> 12:43.179
Okay, you see, this is a comment
calling Jayden shallow.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.807
That's a little hurtful
but no problem, I just won't engage.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.143
It's so great having you here, Solana.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.729
Jayden usually ignores me
whenever I talk--

12:51.812 --> 12:54.315
Can't pull off a romper? How dare they?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.698
This one's not right either.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.326
Claire, you're crazy. It's amazing.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.703
As were the five other
Little House on the Prairie

13:07.787 --> 13:10.039
but make it sexy sundresses before it.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.458
I would be showing you pictures of them

13:12.541 --> 13:16.045
in the digital look-book I would've
created by this point if I had my phone!

13:17.046 --> 13:17.963
I'm sorry.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.759
Oh, none of these are right!

13:21.842 --> 13:23.177
Okay, babe, stop.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.639
You never freak out about what you're
going to wear, even when you should.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.641
Like that time we were background drinkers

13:28.724 --> 13:31.936
on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
and you wore untorn denim.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.564
What's going on?
This is clearly not about the outfit.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.027
I-- I did something bad today.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.323
Again, Claire, the other Skittles don't
know that you like the red ones best.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.492
It's not that.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.995
Everything was fine
until Dave looked for his left sock.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.330
Aren't they the same?

13:51.413 --> 13:54.416
Yeah, but there's one he prefers
on his left and one on his right.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.001
-That's adorable.
-I know,

13:56.085 --> 14:00.422
but when he found Lefty under my bed,
he also found something else.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.262
Grant's coffee-stained shirt.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.973
-This is the shirt?
-Mm-hm.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.725
Huh. I always imagined it...

14:12.351 --> 14:13.644
cuter.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.229
So what's the issue?

14:15.312 --> 14:18.941
When he asked me what it was,
I said it was my dirty laundry.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.360
You lied? Why would you lie?

14:21.443 --> 14:24.989
I don't know, but when he asked me,
I suddenly felt guilty.

14:25.573 --> 14:29.910
Claire, when Grant gave you this shirt,
you said you just wanted to be friends.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.120
I know, but...

14:32.454 --> 14:33.831
But?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.793
I think I still have feelings for Grant.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.962
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?

14:40.045 --> 14:43.007
-Calm down, you're freaking out.
-I'm freaking out.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.635
-I need to go someplace to think alone.
-Great. I'm coming with you.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.928
Duh.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.725
-Have you seen Claire?
-I know, right?

14:52.808 --> 14:55.811
Huh? Wait, so you have seen Claire?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
Don't listen to them,
you look great, babe.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.401
Is this one of those things
where you talk to my inner child?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.361
Because she's not here right now.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.614
I'm good with anything but sushi.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.240
Solana.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.950
Hey, Chelsea, what's up?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.786
Hi, I need to talk to Claire.
Have you seen her?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.038
No, I haven't.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.706
Okay. Um...

15:18.292 --> 15:19.460
I need some advice.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.212
You know how you told me

15:22.296 --> 15:25.007
-to let go of my crush on Grant?
-Yeah.

15:25.507 --> 15:30.471
Well, the opposite kind of happened.
There's just something between us.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.806
And he feels it too?

15:33.307 --> 15:37.686
Yeah, it's electric. We're like
a modern-day Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.399
-That's from--
-Pride and Prejudice, I get it, you read.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.359
Right.

15:43.442 --> 15:47.154
I just have to talk to Claire,
you know, to get her blessing.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.616
Good. It's the right thing to do.
What are you gonna say?

15:50.699 --> 15:53.535
I have a thousand ideas
flying back and forth in my head,

15:53.619 --> 15:55.829
they're all kind of jumbled together.

15:55.913 --> 16:00.584
Well, when I'm prepping a legal case,
I like to role-play the debate beforehand.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.711
That way,
when it comes to the actual moment,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.004
I'm prepared for anything.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.965
-Would that help?
-That would be great.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.758
-Okay, go ahead.
-Okay.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.595
Claire, I need to talk to you
about something. Grant and I have--

16:11.679 --> 16:15.140
You and Grant? You like Grant?
How could you?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.267
Do you think
that's how she's gonna respond?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.229
No, but you have to be prepared
for anything.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.940
Like, what if there's an earthquake
while you're talking--

16:23.023 --> 16:25.234
Okay, you know what? That's enough.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.570
I'm just gonna write down
what I need to say to Claire,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.948
and then I'm gonna put together
an earthquake kit,

16:31.031 --> 16:32.908
because now I'm stressed about that too.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.535
Suit yourself.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.621
I gotta get back to Jayden's socials.
But I'm here--

16:40.332 --> 16:42.459
Has that chair always been there?

16:46.714 --> 16:50.342
This is what it feels like
to be in the wild without a phone.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.555
It's the plant store.
It's where I come to think.

16:54.638 --> 16:58.767
I know. It's just-- Ooh!
The leaves are so leafy.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.229
And the flowers are so flowery.
And the smells are so...

17:02.938 --> 17:03.772
Manure-y.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.357
But still very beautiful.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.151
Jayden, focus.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.153
Right, sorry. Okay.

17:09.236 --> 17:13.615
You're going through a massive crisis.
So you still have feelings for Grant

17:13.699 --> 17:15.659
even though you told him you didn't.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.747
Well, I told myself that too. I just...
I was scared, I...

17:19.830 --> 17:22.499
Okay, it's okay. This stuff is hard.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.752
Yeah. Because I made it hard.

17:24.835 --> 17:28.922
Grant was there! He was practically
on one knee and I turned him down.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.926
And then I met Dave,
and Dave is so wonderful.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.221
He's funny and sweet and sexy.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.723
Really sexy.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.186
I've been with him
longer than I've been with anyone.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.188
I'm supposed to meet his parents tonight.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.647
What are you gonna do?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.316
What can I do?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.276
Go back to Grant and tell him how I feel?

17:49.359 --> 17:52.571
I don't even know if he has feelings
for me anymore.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.574
After all I put him through,
it wouldn't be fair.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.995
And I'd never want to do anything
to hurt Dave.

18:01.455 --> 18:05.125
So I think it's best
if I just let sleeping dogs cry.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.714
Look, Claire.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.302
You can't just be with someone
because you don't want to hurt them.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.554
I mean, right?

18:20.808 --> 18:21.725
Oh.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.229
-This is all just such a mess.
-I know.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.273
And you know what,
it's gonna be a mess either way,

18:28.357 --> 18:32.069
so I think the only thing you can do is

18:32.152 --> 18:35.197
be honest with yourself
and go with how you feel.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.285
Okay.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.663
You're right.

18:44.498 --> 18:48.502
Like right now, I feel like I should
cut all ties with my former life

18:48.585 --> 18:50.671
and become a full-time plant daddy.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.096
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.350
So have you talked to Claire yet?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.686
No, I can't get hold of her.

19:05.769 --> 19:09.273
But I wrote down six different versions
of what I wanna say about you and me,

19:09.356 --> 19:12.568
and how much she means to me,
and I used the word sister so many times,

19:12.651 --> 19:15.112
I started referring to us
as women siblings.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.282
I'm still kind of nervous about it.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.534
Well, it's gonna be fine, Chelsea.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.663
In fact, I think it's gonna be great.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.668
-You do?
-Yeah. I really do.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.172
Okay.

19:38.844 --> 19:42.097
But, you know, until then,
we just have to wait.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.557
Right.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.559
Wait.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.147
Here we are...

19:51.190 --> 19:52.357
waiting.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.987
I'll make a reservation
at that Mexican place

19:57.070 --> 19:58.572
I've been wanting to take you to.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.200
-That's not really waiting.
-I know but...

20:02.784 --> 20:04.411
if I sit here any longer...

20:05.287 --> 20:06.455
I'm gonna kiss you.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.264
-Hey, girl.
-Oh, thank God you're home.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.891
I can't take this anymore!

20:25.974 --> 20:28.727
The encouraging comments
are mixing with the flirty messages,

20:28.810 --> 20:32.272
and as far as I can tell,
all of them are at least slightly racist.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.277
Oh, shush, shush, shush.
Be still, my little one, and fret not.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.863
For I have emerged from my digital cleanse

20:39.947 --> 20:44.952
united with the magical wonders of nature
in the form of a plant store on Melrose.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.997
The world, my sweet Solallison,
is so much bigger than us.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.542
There's earth and wind and fire!
The Commodores!

20:54.294 --> 20:58.215
I no longer have to react
to every little thing on the Internet.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.094
That's a relief because
Timothée Chalamet just shaved his head

21:02.177 --> 21:04.179
and I had no idea how to comment.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.639
What now?

21:07.599 --> 21:10.978
-Hey, Jayden. Have you seen Claire?
-You look great, babe.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.356
Claire, you're home.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.608
I just broke up with Dave.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.735
What?

21:32.457 --> 21:34.209
Oh, good.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.503
Hey, Claire. You're home.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.631
Can we talk?
