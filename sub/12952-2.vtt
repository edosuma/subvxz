WEBVTT

00:05.530 --> 00:07.180
Where the hell is my father?

00:08.710 --> 00:11.490
Not a problem, my loyalty is flexible.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.050
You got married ?

00:17.730 --> 00:18.390
I did

00:19.560 --> 00:22.840
You wanna know how i'm ? I'm Horrible !

00:23.340 --> 00:24.730
Not because i lost you

00:25.450 --> 00:26.130
But because...

00:27.010 --> 00:28.160
if it had been me,

00:30.550 --> 00:32.049
I would have waited.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.490
I chose to give information to the CIA with which they were able to dismantle over 200 terrorist cells.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.490
I don't know how you concvinced the CIA that you're rtustworthy.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.890
Adrian Lazareh Russian diplomat.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.090
I've never seen him before.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.490
This was fron a hidden camera that I placed.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.490
This is how I knew you were alive.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:35.520 --> 01:37.430
They're in the elevator.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.030
The clamp is set. Activating the charge.

01:39.190 --> 01:41.200
Acknowledged. ETA one minute.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.170
Okay, Sydney, the test is over.

02:40.270 --> 02:44.510
If you were still under the influence of any valid brainwashing technique,

02:44.780 --> 02:47.430
As for your memory loss, some forms of torture,

02:47.440 --> 02:51.270
electroconvulsive shock therapy for example, can cause amnesia.

02:52.450 --> 02:53.590
He was unarmed.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.420
Dad, I slit that man's throat.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.020
Your remorse is premature.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.590
Without knowing the circumstances,\Nyou can't be sure you didn't have just cause.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.060
I know you don't want the CIA to see\Nthis tape to protect me

03:05.390 --> 03:06.240
but maybe they should.

03:06.450 --> 03:07.740
Sydney, they'll detain you indefinitely.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.540
If they learn you murdered Lazarey, you won't be able to

03:10.710 --> 03:12.560
participate in finding out what happened to you over

03:13.010 --> 03:14.790
the last two years, which, frankly, I need you for.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.000
I don't trust myself right now, Dad.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.820
Maybe the CIA shouldn't either.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.150
Well, I trust you.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.160
I'll keep looking into Lazarey.

03:25.510 --> 03:28.370
Your mother may be helpful...assuming she's still alive.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.210
I haven't spoken to her in a year, but we established a

03:31.260 --> 03:33.870
protocol for making contact. I'll try and reach her.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.940
You deserve to get on with your life.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.720
Why does moving heavy objects automatically mean,

03:46.770 --> 03:49.220
that I need one of those beers? Chop, chop!

03:49.790 --> 03:51.790
Maybe because you're a slave to advertising.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.080
Thank you.

03:55.930 --> 04:00.240
Is that a smile? It's nice to see that again.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.400
Yeah.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.620
You're sure you're okay with this?

04:06.910 --> 04:09.570
I mean, are you going to be all right?

04:09.840 --> 04:10.480
By yourself?

04:10.540 --> 04:12.020
I just can't wrap my head around it.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.150
I mean, Francie's been dead for two years,

04:15.170 --> 04:17.320
but I feel like I saw her a few days ago.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.500
And...now that Will is in witness protection,

04:22.510 --> 04:23.740
I can't even contact him.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.780
All my friends are just...gone.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.990
Not all your friends...

04:34.330 --> 04:35.970
This place isn't so bad...

04:37.470 --> 04:40.190
Come on. Two blocks from the beach!

04:40.690 --> 04:41.620
Are you kidding me!?

04:42.880 --> 04:44.980
And you've got me as a neighbor... \Ntrust me, you're set.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.020
Can I ask you something?

04:49.210 --> 04:49.790
Yeah.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.660
Vaughn's wife...

04:55.650 --> 04:56.430
What's she like?

05:03.020 --> 05:05.170
I'm not sure if you really wanna hear this.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.940
When Vaughn heard that you were dead?

05:13.270 --> 05:15.360
He dropped off the face of the earth.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.360
I mean, literally,Syd, he..he was..

05:18.600 --> 05:21.560
Out of the country for, like, six months.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.760
You need to know that he was not cavalier about moving on.

05:26.550 --> 05:29.230
I mean, I could barely convince him,\Nto consider coming back to the Agency.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.240
He's thinking about coming back?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.550
Well...you don't have to worry about that,\N'cause it's not gonna happen.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.320
Because of me...because I came back, right?

05:49.100 --> 05:50.420
Weiss. Yeah.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.970
Got it. We'll be right there.

05:56.670 --> 06:00.760
At 1300 UTC, two agents of the Central Intelligence Agency

06:00.780 --> 06:02.540
were abducted in Berlin.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.100
We claim responsibility

06:07.130 --> 06:10.470
for this act of aggression against the world's\Nremaining superpower.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.000
Who we are, is unimportant.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.640
What we represent is unimportant.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.180
What we want it to be heard.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.990
Within this audio file are coordinates leading\Nto a designated location.

06:32.020 --> 06:32.720
Go there.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.920
Retrieve the package. Follow our demands.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.190
The two agents, Klein and Rotter,

06:38.240 --> 06:40.730
were working undercover for us at Laszig Aerospace.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.270
We believe they were abducted by a group known as

06:43.320 --> 06:46.740
"The Covenant," a loose affiliation of Russian Nationalists,

06:46.890 --> 06:49.200
comprised of former Central Committee members,

06:49.280 --> 06:52.420
and retired KGB; that we know little about them.

06:52.950 --> 06:55.710
The Covenant seems to function like an organized crime family.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.410
Now the pickup location the Covenant specified is a

06:58.510 --> 07:01.950
theater in Munich in the...red light district, actually...

07:02.080 --> 07:04.280
it's an adult theater. Now, I checked and um,

07:04.320 --> 07:06.110
today's feature, now a rough translation....

07:06.180 --> 07:10.890
I don't actually speak German...\Nit's "Penal Code, Part Deux"

07:10.900 --> 07:12.890
if anybody...cares...I have the times...

07:12.930 --> 07:15.800
I don't like the idea of sending someone\Nin alone to pick up the package.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.810
It's doubtful they'd betray us at this stage.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.970
Breaking their own rules before we even know their

07:21.070 --> 07:23.720
demands would result in a loss of negotiating credibliity.

07:24.210 --> 07:24.970
I'll go.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.650
I want to.

07:28.870 --> 07:30.140
Run the optech with Marshall.

07:31.240 --> 07:31.970
That's it.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.010
Syd, stay a minute.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.450
I'd rather send Weiss.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.410
You're allowed to give yourself time\Nbefore you jump back in with both feet.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.970
The best way I can think of to start feeling normal

07:54.100 --> 07:56.610
is to start acting that way. I need this.

07:57.050 --> 07:59.430
I'm allowing you to go, but you should know...

08:00.260 --> 08:03.510
you're not the only CIA operative that's experienced lost time.

08:05.990 --> 08:08.740
There's a group. Their next meeting's at the end of the week.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.190
I'm in the theater.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.870
We've got you on fly-by, Mountaineer.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.890
The perimeter's clear, no suspect signals...\Nwe're on standby.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.440
It's a box; I'm sweeping it for explosives.

09:08.950 --> 09:10.410
It's clean. Going to open it up.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.020
Proceed with caution, Mountaineer.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.920
Oh, God...

09:40.130 --> 09:40.750
What is it?

09:43.310 --> 09:44.850
One of the agents...

09:48.750 --> 09:49.680
Klein...

09:50.520 --> 09:51.490
...it's his head. .

09:53.910 --> 09:56.350
There's a piece of paper wedged in his mouth.

09:57.820 --> 09:58.850
Gimme a sec.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.090
It's written in Russian.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.200
I have their list of demands.

10:42.110 --> 10:45.470
The death of Peter Klein is a great loss to this agency,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.210
but keep in mind that his colleague is still alive,

10:49.690 --> 10:51.110
and it's our job to bring him home.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.350
National Security Counsel Director Robert Lindsay

10:54.370 --> 10:55.700
will be coordinating with us.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.600
As some of you already know,

10:58.770 --> 11:01.460
the Covenant has agreed to return our remaining agent

11:02.120 --> 11:04.140
in exchange for the release of Mr. Sark.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.090
I'm here to inform you,

11:06.220 --> 11:09.770
trading Sark for your remaining asset\Nhas been approved by the NSC.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.270
Wait a minute...we can't just let him go!

11:13.400 --> 11:14.660
To the best of our knowledge,

11:14.980 --> 11:17.410
Sark's been bled dry of every piece of intel he knows.

11:17.630 --> 11:19.510
The burden of criminal justice not withstanding,

11:19.580 --> 11:21.730
he now has a value to us only as a commodity in trade.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.860
Without even knowing why these people want Sark,\Nhow can we even consider this!?

11:24.920 --> 11:28.080
We think we know why they want him.\NThey want him so they can kill him.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.990
Intelligence provided by Arvin Sloane indicates

11:31.220 --> 11:33.180
that Sark may be responsible for the death

11:33.270 --> 11:35.040
of a high ranking member within the Covenant.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.020
They may want revenge.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.110
If your 'revenge' theory is wrong, we're setting a terrorist free,

11:39.680 --> 11:41.240
to say nothing of the fact that taking

11:41.240 --> 11:43.630
Arvin Sloane's intel at face value is insane.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.640
While I'm fully aware of your history with Sloane,

11:45.850 --> 11:48.510
if Director Dixon can trust him, I think you can, too.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.080
For the record, I don't.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.050
I never will.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.780
But I can't deny that, despite my feelings for Sloane,

11:55.930 --> 11:59.720
he has provided us with accurate intelligence for over a year now.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.540
I'm authorizing the trade.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.780
You and Weiss will escort\NMr. Sark to the exchange point in Mexico.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.000
You'll leave in four hours.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.290
I'll come back...

12:12.620 --> 12:15.640
Since when did the NSC become so eager\Nto negotiate with terrorists?

12:15.740 --> 12:17.840
Bob Linsday has the White House spin machine ready

12:17.840 --> 12:19.700
to cover him when his actions prove ill advised.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.620
He's nearly untouchable.

12:20.670 --> 12:21.800
I'd love to prove that wrong.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.170
You've come close enough in forcing his hand with my release.

12:24.270 --> 12:25.940
While you're in Mexico making the exchange,

12:26.040 --> 12:27.510
I'm going to Zurich to see Sloane.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.050
He'll be expecting me and we should appear predictable.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.690
I'll have that adjusted.

12:47.990 --> 12:49.460
Where was I buried?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.750
You were...cremated.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.200
Vaughn spread your ashes at sea.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.510
N'oubliez pas lundi soir "les 400 coups",

13:04.630 --> 13:07.520
on le joue à la Cinémathèque\N D'autre part, ce sera une version sans sous-titres.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.990
So, if you guys didn't understand what I just said...good luck on the quiz...

13:34.040 --> 13:35.250
You're a French teacher, huh?

13:38.130 --> 13:38.630
Yeah.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.420
I know that you're thinking about coming back...to the Agency.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.130
On the off chance that your hesitation is out

13:50.330 --> 13:51.790
of some courtesy to me...

13:54.630 --> 13:55.830
you can forget about it.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.470
I...I mean... I can handle you being there.

14:00.570 --> 14:01.560
Don't worry about me.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.460
The other day you said I gave up on us

14:13.470 --> 14:14.310
because I didn't have faith;

14:15.910 --> 14:17.630
that somehow you didn't mean enough to me.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.250
When I said that, I was...

14:19.300 --> 14:20.480
No, let me finish.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.360
After you died,

14:26.140 --> 14:27.610
I used to talk to you...

14:28.710 --> 14:29.760
like you were still around.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.770
Literally, out loud, whole conversations about...

14:35.690 --> 14:36.410
nothing...

14:37.680 --> 14:38.480
the weather...

14:39.290 --> 14:40.590
Should I get a new car?

14:42.270 --> 14:43.320
Should I have another drink?...

14:45.920 --> 14:46.950
Then one day...

14:47.960 --> 14:48.970
you started answering.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.530
I mean, I could hear you in my head...

14:53.990 --> 14:55.540
like you were right next to me, Sydney.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.610
And although rationally I knew I was a guy who...

14:59.630 --> 15:03.300
stayed up nights drinking...\Ntalking to his dead girlfriend...

15:04.610 --> 15:06.170
Still, I couldn't stop.

15:07.630 --> 15:11.030
So, before you tell me you can handle me\Ncoming back to the CIA

15:12.140 --> 15:13.490
There is Two things you need to know

15:16.110 --> 15:19.970
First...is that I was so in love with you...

15:21.340 --> 15:22.370
that it nearly killed me.

15:25.390 --> 15:26.600
And second...

15:28.670 --> 15:31.160
that I don't regret moving on with my life.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.770
The president of the World Bank that you stop by his table.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.540
We've received word that he's...willing to make a sizable

15:44.560 --> 15:46.110
contribution to our cancer research.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.850
His wife's a vegetarian, so make sure she's attended to.

15:58.710 --> 15:59.690
Send him in.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.350
I need you to excuse me.

16:12.940 --> 16:14.640
A world relief organization...

16:16.560 --> 16:20.460
the sheer audacity of your alleged turnaround would be laughable

16:20.530 --> 16:21.720
if you weren't so dangerous.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.360
I was wondering when you'd come to see me, Jack.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.790
You don't really expect me to believe that you've changed.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.460
I expect you to believe in the consistency of my obsessions.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.900
Jack, I pursued the Rambaldi puzzle across the world for over 30 years.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.300
It never occurred to me that when the artifacts were finally assembled,

16:44.360 --> 16:49.570
that they would produce nothing more than a message...of peace.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.880
Personally, I would have found it anticlimactic...

16:55.110 --> 16:57.350
that after expecting to assemble a weapon of ultimate power,

16:57.580 --> 17:01.220
you ended up with a revelation you could have\Nacquired from a fortune cookie.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.170
Always the aetheist, Jack.

17:06.730 --> 17:08.890
Hmm... I've missed you.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.369
I'll come to the point.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.190
I believe you're responsible for Sydney's disappearance.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.599
Tell me why, right now,

17:19.290 --> 17:21.190
and give her the peace of mind she deserves.

17:21.230 --> 17:25.310
In exchange, I'll halt my efforts to invalidate your pardon agreement.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.060
Jack, don't go digging; you won't find anything.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.150
I know that you were imprisoned for\Nmaking contact with your ex-wife.

17:32.450 --> 17:35.120
You went to Irina Derevko for help to find Sydney.

17:35.310 --> 17:37.090
Now I wouldn't have believed

17:37.890 --> 17:42.060
that you would ally yourself\Nwith a woman you vowed you'd never trust again.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.030
So, if you're capable of having such a change of heart,

17:47.560 --> 17:49.800
why is it so hard to believe that I am as well?

17:52.100 --> 17:56.100
Because every morally questionable thing I have done

17:56.210 --> 17:57.880
has been to protect Sydney.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.630
You don't have the same excuse.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.140
Really?

18:11.470 --> 18:13.450
I investigated Sydney's death, too.

18:14.630 --> 18:17.310
This file contains all the leads I pursued...

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
mostly dead ends.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.900
I'm hoping you'll find something in it that's useful.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.710
I trust that you will look at it...

18:28.950 --> 18:30.400
before you dismiss it outright.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.150
Should I take this as your official denial

18:37.190 --> 18:38.880
of any involvement in Sydney's disappearance?

18:43.300 --> 18:45.410
Then, you've just made the worst mistake of your life.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.010
I'm going to bury you.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.450
I wanted a word before you get traded.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.320
Dear God,

19:11.930 --> 19:13.190
it can't possibly be you...

19:13.740 --> 19:16.720
Don't start this conversation by acting surprised that I'm alive.

19:19.150 --> 19:22.100
you know how highly I regard your abilities\Nas an operative, but...

19:22.670 --> 19:26.530
even I didn't think you were capable of cheating\Ndeath once your remains had been identified...

19:27.620 --> 19:29.000
which begs the question...

19:29.520 --> 19:31.970
if it wasn't your body they removed from the ashes...

19:32.940 --> 19:33.670
whose was it?

19:35.190 --> 19:37.270
I read the transcripts of your confessions...

19:38.810 --> 19:43.670
including the fact that you and a woman named\NAllison Doren killed my friend...

19:45.720 --> 19:46.370
Francie.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.650
If you've read my transcript, you know how cooperative I've been.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.890
I'll be glad to pay you the same courtesy\N if you simply tell me what you're getting at.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.490
That explosion in my apartment was a cover up...

19:59.190 --> 20:00.830
to make the CIA believe I was dead.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.100
What I believe is that Sloane abducted me,\NI think you know why...

20:04.690 --> 20:06.740
but you failed to mention that in your confession.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.540
If I'm to understand what you're saying,

20:09.670 --> 20:13.840
you have no idea where you've been for the last two years.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.480
None?

20:20.940 --> 20:22.080
Unbelievable!

20:23.750 --> 20:26.300
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, it's just...

20:26.670 --> 20:27.610
I'm speechless.

20:28.940 --> 20:32.460
Sydney, if Sloane had intended to abduct you,\NI wasn't privy to it.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.600
What if I said I still don't believe you?

20:37.520 --> 20:38.970
I'd say it'd make no difference.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.110
In 24 hours I'll be free, and...\Nyou'll remain in the dark.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.340
See you in Mexico.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.560
We've agreed to a location in the Sonora desert\N as the point of exchange.

21:09.090 --> 21:11.570
Each side is allowed no more than a five man cover team.

21:12.780 --> 21:17.540
Once the exchange is initiated,\NSark and Rotter will be released simultaneously.

21:24.220 --> 21:26.550
I assure you, this organization, the Covenant,

21:26.810 --> 21:28.980
is as much a mystery to me as it is to the CIA.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.320
I can't imagine why they'd want to make this trade.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.420
You're about to find out.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.730
My life's in danger, isn't it?

22:09.430 --> 22:12.220
Space Ops, we've received a call signal. Should I confirm?

22:12.310 --> 22:13.630
You're authorized, Mountaineer.

22:27.290 --> 22:29.100
We have a visual on Agent Rotter.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.850
Roger, Mountaineer. Release the prisoner.

22:36.610 --> 22:37.350
You're up.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.980
Space Ops, we have incoming vehicles.\NWe need an Iden immediately.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.620
They're not ours, Mountaineer.

23:07.790 --> 23:09.550
We're trying to get a visual. Stand by.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.870
If we don't finish this trade before those vehicles get here,

23:11.900 --> 23:13.360
the Covenant will think it's a doublecross.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.530
There's a chopper inbound. It's one of ours!

23:24.670 --> 23:26.740
CIA operatives! This is Sgt.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.140
Trask of Delta Force! Put down your weapons!

23:30.940 --> 23:34.740
This operation has been countermanded by the National Security Council!

23:36.130 --> 23:37.150
Take cover!

23:47.110 --> 23:47.950
Sydney, report!

23:48.100 --> 23:49.960
Delta Force just showed up out of nowhere!

23:50.060 --> 23:51.490
Lindsay ambushed us!

23:52.140 --> 23:53.300
Get me Bob Lindsay! Now!

24:00.630 --> 24:03.330
Don't tell me to calm down! You used my agents as bait!

24:03.520 --> 24:06.310
I'm trying to reaquire your missing agent\N without releasing Mr. Sark.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.020
Now, I'm sorry I didn't fill you in, Director Dixon,

24:08.050 --> 24:10.380
but I don't trust the CIA to maintain operational secrecy.

24:10.660 --> 24:11.850
You son of a bitch!

24:11.930 --> 24:13.980
Yeah...can I get back to you, Director?\NI'm a little busy...

24:27.650 --> 24:28.210
Great!

24:41.470 --> 24:43.810
Both of you! Get in! Go!

24:48.430 --> 24:50.150
Psycho's getting away with both of 'em!

25:17.610 --> 25:18.850
Son of a bitch!

25:19.650 --> 25:21.440
We should have gotten that last hostage back.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.520
We would have if...\NWho the hell do you think you are!?

25:23.540 --> 25:25.820
I'm the person who's going to\Nhold you accountable if they kill him!

25:25.830 --> 25:27.010
Oh, you're going to hold me responsible!?

25:27.100 --> 25:27.610
Did I stutter?

25:28.220 --> 25:29.570
What exactly is the purpose of this conversation?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.630
To let you know that I will take you to the mat...

25:31.720 --> 25:33.630
every time you pull something like this!

25:33.800 --> 25:36.230
I am not impressed by the fact that you play golf with the President...

25:36.270 --> 25:38.730
What you did was moronic, and borderline criminal!

25:38.800 --> 25:41.790
Did it slip your mind that I am\Nthe Director of the National Security Council!?

25:41.810 --> 25:45.280
I could pick up the phone and have you thrown\Nin the same jail cell your father just vacated...

25:45.310 --> 25:46.210
Hell, it's still warm!

25:46.220 --> 25:49.350
Do it. Give me an object lesson in the abuse of power!

25:49.370 --> 25:50.530
Show me how it's done!

25:51.690 --> 25:53.940
If you're finished...this is the men's room...

25:55.610 --> 25:56.650
Who let you in?

26:10.350 --> 26:12.490
Chateau Patreuse, 1982...

26:13.340 --> 26:14.620
Your favorite, no?

26:16.680 --> 26:17.720
Have we met?

26:19.790 --> 26:21.050
you knew my brother.

26:21.950 --> 26:22.890
Antonin San'ko.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.450
And I suppose this is to be my last drink.

26:30.190 --> 26:31.530
Not necessarily.

26:32.420 --> 26:36.120
I know the bomb you placed in that vehicle\Nwas not meant for him.

26:38.550 --> 26:42.360
On the other hand, it does seem that you owe me...

26:44.270 --> 26:45.700
And what would that price be?

26:50.070 --> 26:51.610
800 million dollars.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.560
800 million dollars?

26:59.570 --> 27:01.470
I have nowhere near that amount in my nest egg.

27:04.530 --> 27:07.140
That, Mr. Sark, you do...

27:27.840 --> 27:30.550
Sydney...Vaughn's qualified for reinstatement.

27:31.510 --> 27:35.580
Until his field rating's been updated,\Nhe'll be on analysis, but he's back...

27:35.960 --> 27:36.950
effective immediately.

27:38.380 --> 27:39.870
If there are any special considerations

27:39.890 --> 27:42.050
either of you would like me to take into account,

27:42.610 --> 27:43.990
now's the time to speak up.

27:47.270 --> 27:48.100
Welcome back.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.280
Thanks.

27:53.870 --> 27:54.930
Hello, Jack.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.620
I just found out why the Covenant is interested in Mr. Sark.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.040
At 10 o'clock this morning,

28:01.280 --> 28:04.850
Sark walked into the Thornton Bank in the Cayman Islands,

28:04.980 --> 28:07.850
accompanied by Ushek San'ko, a known operative of the Covenant.

28:10.550 --> 28:15.500
He was then led downstairs,\Nwhere he used his thumbprint to access an executive vault.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.240
Inside the vault was a little over 800 million in gold bullion.

28:23.570 --> 28:27.520
More surprising is the fact that Sark had no idea\N he was entitled to that money...

28:28.460 --> 28:29.150
Entitled?

28:29.510 --> 28:30.530
Eight months ago,

28:30.690 --> 28:36.040
an interagency memorandum reported the murder of\Na Russian diplomat by the name of Andrian Lazarey.

28:36.790 --> 28:38.450
His murderer has never been found.

28:39.070 --> 28:41.920
However, a source of mine has provided evidence indicating

28:42.050 --> 28:44.750
he was a descendent of the Romanov royal family in Russia.

28:45.430 --> 28:47.790
The money was in his trust when he died.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.260
It went to Mr. Sark...Lazarey's son...

28:55.130 --> 28:56.470
Hey! Vaughn!

28:56.520 --> 28:59.270
We tasked a satellite to track the enemy sedan once it left the desert.

28:59.310 --> 29:03.110
They were tracked to a Frankfurt night club\Nknown for selling top of the line synthetic drugs.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.010
Analysis thinks its a front for the Covenant.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.740
Do we have reason to believe the last hostage is still alive?

29:07.820 --> 29:11.080
Yes. They're aware he's the team leader\Nand therefore has the highest security clearance.

29:11.310 --> 29:14.780
The information they could extract from him\Nwould be priceless to our enemies.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.320
His name is Otto Edel. Drug dealer; he runs the club.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.200
He'll know where our agent's being held.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.530
I want you to accompany the hostage rescue team.

29:24.310 --> 29:25.630
Actually, I had an idea...

29:25.690 --> 29:29.600
I think Syd should go in as a biochem major,\Nyou know, Harvard dropout,

29:29.620 --> 29:35.350
totally spoiled, maybe she got kicked out\Nfor synthesizing Exstasy in her dormroom, or crystal crank...

29:35.370 --> 29:37.090
Fine. Marshall, run the optech.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.010
The CIA would have discovered Lazarey's connection to Sark on their own,

29:43.090 --> 29:46.000
so there was no added risk to you in breaking the news myself.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.910
Without that tape, the CIA can't link you to his death.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.320
This can't be a coincidence.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.260
I'm responsible for Lazarey's death and nine months later,

29:53.340 --> 29:57.240
the Covenant gets Sark released in exchange\Nfor his 800 million dollar inheritance!?

29:59.700 --> 30:02.160
It's looking more likely they're responsible for your 2 year absence.

30:02.530 --> 30:05.570
Be it under duress, or by some...other unknown means,

30:05.770 --> 30:07.770
they compelled you to carry out the assassination.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.770
I've scheduled to contact your mother tonight;\Nhopefully she'll be some help.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.390
It's for him.

32:15.380 --> 32:16.850
You're very attractive...

32:17.790 --> 32:18.960
for a chemist.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.270
Thank you for meeting with me.

32:22.510 --> 32:24.410
I like to keep my options open,

32:24.520 --> 32:28.780
although I doubt you can improve on my little...cocktail.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.700
I can triple your sales.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.480
Really? How?

32:34.490 --> 32:36.320
By making your drug more addictive.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.000
Take a look.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.110
Very impressive. Where did you learn your trade?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.910
I was a biochem major at Harvard,

33:01.930 --> 33:05.850
not that I think they'll be asking me to make\Nany commencement speeches in the near future.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.150
Their loss...my gain.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.190
I need one liter of your product.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.620
Oh! Just like that, hmmm?

33:14.240 --> 33:18.160
I'll chemically alter it according to the spec\Nyou saw and have it back to you within the week.

33:18.790 --> 33:21.000
If you don't see demand go up, you owe me nothing.

33:22.270 --> 33:26.140
Somehow I would not mind being indebted to you.

33:29.990 --> 33:33.110
Make yourself comfortable. I will only be a moment.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.990
This has a street value of 50,000 dollars.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.090
Mind if I try it?

33:50.220 --> 33:51.290
Be my guest.

33:55.630 --> 33:58.590
Of course, if I'm going to let you walk out of here with that,

33:58.830 --> 34:03.740
I'll need some sort of...collateral. You understand.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.710
I didn't bring any money.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.179
I do accept...other forms of payment...

34:16.239 --> 34:18.020
There's an air bubble in there...

34:20.389 --> 34:22.620
Do exactly as I say or I push the plunger.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.030
Where is the alarm terminal that protects the sub-basement?

34:25.659 --> 34:26.260
Bitch!

34:26.530 --> 34:28.360
Tell me where it is or you get an aneurysm!

34:28.420 --> 34:33.139
Okay...down the hall, first door.\NBut I only manage the facility,

34:33.159 --> 34:35.070
I do not know the codes, I swear!

34:42.290 --> 34:44.219
Mountaineer to Space Ops. I've found the alarm terminal.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.300
I'll need a minute to hack.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.610
Copy that, Mountaineer. Blue team, do not breach until advised.

34:48.710 --> 34:49.380
Alarm is active.

34:49.429 --> 34:51.409
Copy that, Space Ops. We're holding outside rear entrance.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.900
Once Mountaineer disables the alarm, we'll proceed inside.

34:55.130 --> 34:55.719
Copy that.

34:59.780 --> 35:04.200
Mountaineer, your entrance to the sublevel\Nwill be through the last door down on the north hallway.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.000
Marshall, why does all this cabling run to the control room?

35:07.350 --> 35:09.710
Looks like...some sort of filtration system...

35:11.920 --> 35:13.680
I've got the code; I'm entering it now.

35:13.800 --> 35:14.630
What could it be used for?

35:14.770 --> 35:17.250
It could be a halon based fire supression system,\Nsome alarms...

35:18.250 --> 35:20.050
Sydney, stop! You've got the wrong code!

35:20.200 --> 35:21.820
The alarm will be triggered by that sequence!

35:22.540 --> 35:24.120
Remember the security system in Nepal?

35:24.470 --> 35:25.620
It's the same system!

35:26.110 --> 35:28.090
Those numbers can be converted into a password;

35:28.120 --> 35:29.940
that is the real code! Read me the sequence!

35:29.970 --> 35:30.550
Give me a pen.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.000
746F70686174.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.090
Blue team, stand by.

35:37.350 --> 35:37.800
Copy that.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.940
Okay. Tophat...try Tophat!

35:45.350 --> 35:47.110
Okay, it worked; the alarm's deactivated.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.810
Blue team, the system is disarmed. Move in.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.450
Copy that.

35:59.930 --> 36:02.120
Blue team, I read two guards at your 3 o'clock.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.100
Space Ops...Guards down.

36:24.370 --> 36:25.550
CIA, freeze!

36:30.780 --> 36:33.540
I'm CIA. You're going to be okay, Agent Rotter.

36:33.570 --> 36:35.430
Oh, thank God! Thank God!

36:37.220 --> 36:38.910
Space Ops, I have the prisoner. He's okay.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.510
You kept your promise.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.430
You said you would kill me.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.370
You were my favorite...

36:58.030 --> 37:00.680
...you never broke.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.290
Who the hell are you!? What are you talking about!?

37:07.750 --> 37:10.030
Wh...why...why did the Covenant take two years of my life!?

37:25.370 --> 37:27.090
The last thing I remember seeing was the

37:27.110 --> 37:29.390
missile threat warning on my cockpit display.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.790
The next thing I know,

37:31.810 --> 37:35.580
I'm being lifted by a special forces team out of an Iraqi hospital.

37:37.390 --> 37:40.590
I still don't know what happened in those 18 months in between.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.390
The hardest thing is...what I do remember:

37:46.430 --> 37:48.100
my life before.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.730
I can't seem to let go of it.

37:53.450 --> 37:55.160
Even worse than not remembering...

37:56.470 --> 37:57.420
are the dreams.

37:59.390 --> 38:02.380
And I can't tell if they're part of something that really happened to me,

38:02.450 --> 38:06.180
or my mind trying to fill in the blanks so I finally can get some answers.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.150
Thank you, Tom.

38:10.110 --> 38:11.720
Well, we have a new member today.

38:12.380 --> 38:14.720
Sydney, welcome.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.590
If you have anything to say, we'd be happy to hear it.

38:21.750 --> 38:24.430
Right now, it just helps to listen, thanks.

38:24.890 --> 38:26.100
How long you been back?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.140
A little over a week.

38:30.970 --> 38:32.440
The dreams start yet? Nightmares?

38:33.690 --> 38:34.410
Nope.

38:36.990 --> 38:37.810
They will.

38:47.490 --> 38:47.980
Sydney...

38:48.020 --> 38:52.750
I appreciate that you think it's good for me to know\N that there are other people out there who've experienced what I have,

38:52.750 --> 38:53.250
but you cannot put me into that group!

38:54.440 --> 38:55.010
Sydney...

38:55.090 --> 38:58.190
Look, I'm not even gonna pretend that it isn't hard to see Vaughn...

38:59.180 --> 39:00.700
Do I still have feelings for him?

39:00.700 --> 39:02.340
Of course I do. Finding out that...

39:02.370 --> 39:05.410
Sydney. This is Lauren Reed.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.140
She's going to be our new liaison to the National Security Council.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.580
I...I didn't mean to interrupt.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.520
I..I didn't know you were here...I..I..I'm sorry.

39:15.370 --> 39:18.750
It's okay, really.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.990
Apparently, you had a coversation with Bob Lindsay

39:22.040 --> 39:23.790
in the men's room of the federal building

39:23.990 --> 39:26.560
in which you made your distaste for him abundantly clear.

39:29.570 --> 39:30.670
I...guess I did.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.800
Well...he got the message,\Nbecause he decided to return to Washington.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.380
He's assigned Agent Reed here in his place\Nto assist our efforts against the Covenant.

39:40.980 --> 39:46.080
She'll also be looking into the murder of Andrian Lazarey\Nas part of a joint investigation with the Kremlin.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.850
If there's anything I can do to help...

39:51.350 --> 39:54.440
You should know, in addition to being the new NSC liaison,

39:55.050 --> 39:57.030
I'm also Michael Vaughn's wife.

40:02.440 --> 40:02.890
Hi...
