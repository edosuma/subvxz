You know how many guys
are cracked up in here?

01:53.291 --> 01:56.250
[Kit] Oh, Papa Bear.
Nobody's as good as you.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.041
You've forgotten more
than most pilots ever learned.

01:59.125 --> 02:02.625

02:14.792 --> 02:16.041
[Kit] Watch it!

02:19.750 --> 02:22.250
No room to turn around.
Maybe we can climb out of this.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.375
Baloo!

02:26.500 --> 02:27.917
Yeeaah!

02:28.917 --> 02:31.250
Pass the ketchup, kid.
This may be our last meal.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.875
See? That wasn't so bad.

02:37.583 --> 02:40.041
If you liked that, you're gonna love this.

02:49.875 --> 02:53.250
Hold together, baby.
Papa Bear will get you home.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.417
Controls are out! I can't hold her!

02:57.500 --> 03:00.625
[Baloo and Kit] Aah!

03:13.667 --> 03:15.583
Baloo? Baloo?

03:17.667 --> 03:20.125
Come on, Papa Bear, wake up.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.291
Double mustard, hold the onions.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.750
Baloo, you're all right.

03:33.542 --> 03:36.250
[Kit] At least you're in better shape
than your baby.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.083
What baby?

03:38.166 --> 03:39.959
The <i>Sea Duck, </i> of course.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.792
Funny name for a plane.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.542
Hey, I guess it sort of quacked up!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.709
Rebecca isn't gonna think it's so funny.

03:50.792 --> 03:53.625
Rebecca... Re-- Rebecca.

03:53.709 --> 03:56.250
Now, where have I heard that name before?

03:59.917 --> 04:02.208
Where could those two be?

04:02.291 --> 04:03.250
[steamboat whistle]

04:03.333 --> 04:04.959
Could be there.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.875
Where have you been? And where is Baloo?
And what did he do to the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

04:16.959 --> 04:18.208
Entered it into a demolition derby?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.709
You look awful. Where is my cargo?

04:20.791 --> 04:22.375
[Baloo] Hello, lady.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.917
Baloo, you're hurt!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
We've got to get you into bed.
Kit, get some aspirin.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.166
Get bandages. Boil some water.
Call a doctor.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.417
Are you OK?

04:29.500 --> 04:30.750
Uh, yeah.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.458
Is he OK?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.625
I'm not sure.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.500
Now, little ducky,

04:45.583 --> 04:48.166
this is only gonna hurt for a second.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.458
[Kit] Morning, Papa Bear. How's the head?

04:54.542 --> 04:56.417
Fine, kid.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.959
Oh, man, what a dream.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.083
I-- that plane!

05:01.166 --> 05:05.041
It was in my dream,
but it was all banged up.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.834
Looks great, eh? Thanks to Wildcat.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.208
You want to check her out?

05:11.417 --> 05:13.417
Nice.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.625
Don't you want to check out the cockpit?
It's all fixed up too.

05:17.709 --> 05:18.583
Sure.

05:23.208 --> 05:26.000
Hey! This is neat!

05:26.083 --> 05:28.917
Uh, that's my seat, Baloo.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.125
Oh, sure.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.834
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

05:34.917 --> 05:36.750
Hee hee!

05:37.834 --> 05:41.250
I'm sorry. Uncle Wildcat hit you too hard?

05:42.333 --> 05:45.041
I said I'm sorry!

05:49.959 --> 05:54.458
Uh, well, shall we start her up?

05:54.542 --> 05:56.500
Go for it, kid.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.083
Me?

05:59.166 --> 06:01.500
Well, gee. Thanks, Baloo.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.083
OK. Magnet's on.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.583
Set mixture.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.333
Throttle to here, and...

06:10.500 --> 06:11.667
Hey, that looks fun!

06:11.750 --> 06:14.917
Magnet's on, mix up your set,
throttle stay here.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.250
No! That reverses the props!

06:20.417 --> 06:22.458
Aah!

06:23.083 --> 06:25.250
Baloo, what are you doing?

06:25.333 --> 06:26.333
I don't know.

06:26.417 --> 06:29.542
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're a pilot.

06:29.625 --> 06:33.041
Go on! I've never flown
a plane in my life.

06:33.125 --> 06:33.959
What?

06:34.041 --> 06:37.041
[Becky] What's going on in there?
Is Baloo all right?

06:37.542 --> 06:41.709
Just fine, but the kid is trying
to tell me that I am a pilot.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.291
[Kit] Sorry Miss Cunningham.
Bad aerodynamics in the fractulator.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.542
It's OK now.

06:48.625 --> 06:53.125
Wildcat, would you get in here, please?

06:53.208 --> 06:55.250
Baloo, of course you're a pilot.

06:56.709 --> 07:00.709
Oh, no! The crash! The bump on your head.

07:00.792 --> 07:03.667
You must have amnesia.

07:03.750 --> 07:07.333
[Becky] Guys! We've got cargo to ship.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.667
She's a nice lady.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.917
She's also your boss!

07:12.000 --> 07:14.792
If you don't fly this plane,
she'll fire you.

07:14.875 --> 07:18.333
How can I get fired for not doing
something I don't know how to do?

07:20.792 --> 07:22.667
[Baloo] Vroom! Ha ha!

07:22.750 --> 07:23.875
Vroom! Vroom!

07:23.959 --> 07:25.375
Ha ha!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.333
It's about time.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.041
Baloo. Just watch what Wildcat does

07:41.125 --> 07:43.500
and see if it brings back memories. OK?

07:43.583 --> 07:46.166
Do I have to watch him crash?

07:46.250 --> 07:48.166
Oh! Wildcat, pull up!

07:52.041 --> 07:54.625
Oh, Baloo, stop showing off.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.667
[Kit] OK, Baloo, we're safe now.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.750
Any memories coming back to you?

07:58.834 --> 08:02.125
Yeah, this reminds me of the night
we didn't pay the electric bill.

08:02.208 --> 08:06.000
Just watch what Wildcat does.
You'll remember.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.750
It's simple. Got your elevator trim here.
Rudder's here.

08:08.834 --> 08:10.959
And see all these gizmos
do different things, OK?

08:11.041 --> 08:12.417
But don't touch these guys.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.333
And here's your altitude, RPMs and ABCs
and RIPs. You try, OK?

08:16.417 --> 08:17.500
[Baloo] OK.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.667
Whoa!

08:19.750 --> 08:20.834
[Kit] Oh!

08:20.917 --> 08:22.709
Hey, that was pretty good!

08:22.792 --> 08:27.000
But maybe you should save aerobatics
till lesson two, OK?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.417
Or maybe lesson 10.

08:30.250 --> 08:34.500
[Wildcat] "Thunderstorms are
dangerous to airplanes.

08:34.582 --> 08:38.833
In the event you encounter one,
you should fly around it."

08:43.457 --> 08:45.667
Hey, we'll get out of this.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.208
I've seen you do it a 100 times.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.875
How many times have you done it?

08:50.959 --> 08:54.208
Counting this time? Uh, once.

08:58.542 --> 09:00.208
What do we do now?

09:00.834 --> 09:02.542
I think we crash.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.291
[Baloo] Aah!

09:05.375 --> 09:07.500
[Kit] Put them on! Quick! We got to jump.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.166
Out of a plane?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.417
[Kit and Wildcat] Aah!

09:27.709 --> 09:31.291
Kit! Wildcat!

09:31.375 --> 09:33.959
Baloo? Baloo, get out!

09:34.750 --> 09:35.917
[Kit] Baloo!

09:41.041 --> 09:42.625
[Baloo] Let me out of here!

09:42.709 --> 09:43.709
Help!

09:43.792 --> 09:46.125
Somebody help!

09:49.625 --> 09:51.834
[man] <i>Need some help up there?</i>

09:53.208 --> 09:57.125
Hello? Help! I'm caught in a storm.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.458
<i>What storm?</i>

10:02.375 --> 10:06.083
<i>So what are you waiting for,</i>
<i>son? Bring her down.</i>

10:06.166 --> 10:07.291
[Baloo] Where?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.750
B-- b-- but I can't fly.

10:12.834 --> 10:15.291
<i>Horse lips. Anybody can fly.</i>

10:15.375 --> 10:18.458
<i>Just take the controls</i>
<i>and do what I say.</i>

10:19.875 --> 10:23.709
<i>Pull back a tad on the wheel</i>
<i>and turn her a little to the left.</i>

10:25.709 --> 10:29.542
<i>Good. Now back her back</i>
<i>the other way. Nice and easy.</i>

10:29.625 --> 10:32.083
[Baloo] Oh! Oh, no!

10:32.166 --> 10:33.834
<i>Doing fine, son.</i>

10:33.917 --> 10:35.959
<i>Ease the throttle back.</i>

10:36.041 --> 10:38.333
<i>A little bit more.</i>

10:38.333 --> 10:40.542
<i>Half-mile out and looking good.</i>

10:41.458 --> 10:42.625
<i>Pull back the wheel a bit.</i>

10:42.709 --> 10:44.625
<i>Now get her nose up.</i>

10:46.125 --> 10:48.208
I'm going to crash!

10:48.291 --> 10:50.542
<i>You can't crash</i>
<i>as long as you're flying,</i>

10:50.625 --> 10:52.625
<i>and son, you're flying fine.</i>

10:52.709 --> 10:54.375
<i>Pull the nose up.</i>

10:54.458 --> 10:56.417
<i>A little more.</i>

10:56.500 --> 10:58.750
<i>Ease the throttle back.</i>

11:00.500 --> 11:02.917
<i>10 feet... 5.</i>

11:03.000 --> 11:07.208
<i>OK, pull the wheel</i>

11:23.333 --> 11:24.333
Hello.

Mister?

11:31.083 --> 11:32.542
You can call me Joe.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.792
Well, can't say
that was the best landing I ever saw,

11:44.875 --> 11:48.208
but any landing at all
would be a miracle, considering.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.750
Considering what?

11:49.834 --> 11:53.917
Considering that in another 30 seconds,
your good engine would have conked out

11:54.000 --> 11:55.333
and you would have crashed.

11:55.417 --> 11:57.417
Oh!

11:59.333 --> 12:01.417
Look! A town.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.917
[Wildcat] Where?

12:05.375 --> 12:08.667
Maybe we can hire a car
or a truck or something.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.542
We got to find Baloo.

12:10.625 --> 12:13.458
What if he didn't bail out?
What if he crashed?

12:13.542 --> 12:14.834
What if he's--

[snoring]

12:23.041 --> 12:23.959
Huh?

12:27.625 --> 12:28.583

12:56.250 --> 12:58.625
Honey of a plane you got here.

12:58.709 --> 13:01.375
What they aren't coming up with
these days.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.500
Well, other than your radio's shot,

13:06.583 --> 13:08.458
she's all ready to take off.

13:08.542 --> 13:09.959
T-- T-- Take off?

13:10.041 --> 13:13.625
I know what you're thinking.
These cliffs are too high to climb over.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.083
Well, you're right.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.375
Only way out's through there.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.250
Caved in years ago.
Just keep your eyes peeled

13:20.333 --> 13:22.166
and your flaps down and you'll be fine.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.750
Well, clear skies.

13:24.750 --> 13:28.041
Wait, Mr. McGee. Uh, Joe.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.125
Hey, wait a minute!

13:30.458 --> 13:32.792
Listen, thanks for saving my life
last night.

13:32.875 --> 13:33.959
But, you got a phone around here?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.458
I got to call home,
ring a taxi, catch a bus...

13:36.542 --> 13:39.291
Sorry, no phone.
Only way out is to fly out.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.458
I can't. I mean I used to,
but I got bump on the head.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.458
I've forgotten how to fly.

13:44.542 --> 13:47.834
Son, you landed in the right place.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.750
Welcome to Joe's flying school.

13:49.834 --> 13:54.333
Of course, since you used to fly,
all you need now is my refresher course.

13:54.417 --> 13:58.041
Once a fly-boy,
always a fly-boy I say.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.625
[Baloo stuttering]

14:00.709 --> 14:02.709
Stick back. Nose up.

14:02.792 --> 14:04.333
Now, bank left.

14:05.000 --> 14:05.875
[Baloo] Aah!

14:05.959 --> 14:08.041
No, Baloo, your other left.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.208
[Baloo] Aah!

14:10.291 --> 14:12.875
That's it! I'm walking out of here.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.875
It's 20 miles of sagebrush
and rattlesnakes

14:15.959 --> 14:18.583
to the nearest town.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.208
[mumbling]

14:25.291 --> 14:26.667
[Joe] OK, bank left.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.208
That's the way.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.500
OK, nose up.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.834
You're too low. Pull up!

14:34.875 --> 14:35.834
Oh!

14:37.542 --> 14:39.291
Blecch!

14:39.375 --> 14:41.625
I know you got a pilot in you, son.

14:41.709 --> 14:43.667
I just don't know where you're hiding him.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.709
[Joe] OK, nose up!

14:45.792 --> 14:47.166
[Joe] Little more.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.417
Yeah!

14:52.333 --> 14:54.625
[Baloo] Are you sure I'm ready for this?

14:54.709 --> 14:56.625
You've passed all the basics.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.250
Time for the real thing.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.875
[Joe] OK, Baloo, she's all yours.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.417
Aah!

15:08.750 --> 15:11.583
Nice turn. Now, show me a roll.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.250
[Joe] Outstanding. Let's see a loop.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.667
[Joe] Perfect.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.917
Now what do I do?

15:20.000 --> 15:24.709
Try having some fun. Loosen up.
You're supposed to be having a good time.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.542
Look around you, Baloo.
Up here you're free as a bird.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.667
The skies are yours.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.250
You remember how to fly,

15:32.333 --> 15:34.834
but you've forgotten
what flying's all about.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.083
Whoo! Ha ha!

15:38.166 --> 15:39.917
We did it, Papa Bear!

15:40.000 --> 15:43.333
[Baloo and Kit] Ha ha ha!

15:46.041 --> 15:51.125
[Baloo] Waa-hoo! I remember!

15:51.208 --> 15:55.667
[Baloo and Joe] Ha ha ha!

15:55.750 --> 15:57.166
How did I do, coach?

15:57.250 --> 15:59.250
Now, that's what I call flying.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.625
Son, you've graduated.
You're ready to solo.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.291
S-- S-- Solo?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.917
Sure. How else are you gonna
fly out of here?

16:07.500 --> 16:10.709
I kind of thought you might come along,
just in case I...

16:10.792 --> 16:14.000
No, I got way too much work to do.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.667
[Kit] <i>Watch it! Look out! Yaah!</i>

16:25.750 --> 16:27.291
[Baloo] <i>No way to turn around!</i>

16:27.375 --> 16:28.792
Hold together, baby.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.875
[Baloo] <i>Yeeaah!</i>

16:42.333 --> 16:44.083
Clear skies, son.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.458
Yeeaah!

17:04.666 --> 17:06.750
Forget something?

17:06.834 --> 17:09.959
Well, the weather looks a little rough.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.458
[Joe] Yeah. Real terrifying.

17:12.541 --> 17:15.916
I mean, it's gonna get real bad
any minute. My trick knee never lies.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.165
Right. Trick knee.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.959
Yeah. So, maybe I'll try it later.
OK, Joe?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.375
Oh, sure, son. Later.

17:33.125 --> 17:36.542
We're going have to head back
for more gas pretty soon.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.166
See anything yet?

17:38.250 --> 17:40.166
Not a trace!

17:46.583 --> 17:47.834
[Joe] Come on, fly-boy.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.834
Time to soar with the eagles.

17:49.917 --> 17:53.250
[Baloo sneezing]

17:54.333 --> 17:56.166
Now what's his excuse?

18:06.333 --> 18:08.625
Son, you look awful.

18:08.709 --> 18:13.208
Uh, I think I got
triple high altitude pneumonia.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.250
[coughs]

18:16.333 --> 18:17.792
Or worse.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.542
Gee, that's terrible.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.333
Well, no flying for you.

18:21.417 --> 18:25.500
I've got some work to do.
You need anything, just holler.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.792
Thanks.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.041
Whew!

18:34.500 --> 18:36.875
Aah!

18:36.959 --> 18:38.500
Ow!

18:44.291 --> 18:45.709
Joe, what happened?

18:45.792 --> 18:49.166
Oh, aah! I fell off the ladder,

18:49.250 --> 18:51.750
busted my leg in a million pieces.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.041
Ooh!

18:53.125 --> 18:55.166
Ah! Don't touch me.

18:55.250 --> 18:58.583
Fly to town. Bring Doc Gooper.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.583
Due north 20 miles.

19:00.667 --> 19:01.834
Fly?

19:01.917 --> 19:05.667
Hurry, son, or I'm a goner.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.875
Oh! Ooh!

19:29.917 --> 19:34.250
That's the way, son. Yaa-hoo!

19:40.542 --> 19:42.333
Where could he be?

19:42.417 --> 19:43.959
Yipe! Baloo!

19:49.458 --> 19:52.208
Doctor, doctor, help!

19:52.291 --> 19:55.083
Wait! What is this?

19:55.166 --> 19:56.750
This is an emergency!

19:59.667 --> 20:01.583
Baloo, wait, wait a minute!

20:04.417 --> 20:07.417
What's going on? Where have you been?

20:07.500 --> 20:10.333
I thought he couldn't fly.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.750
He couldn't. He can!

20:13.834 --> 20:16.458
Baloo, you're flying!

20:16.542 --> 20:17.959
How?

20:18.041 --> 20:19.542
I'll explain later, Kit.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.166
What's wrong, Baloo?

20:40.333 --> 20:43.500
Joe? Joe!

20:43.583 --> 20:46.125
What's this all about?

20:46.208 --> 20:48.959
Have you got an injured man here or not?

20:49.041 --> 20:51.291
Yeah, yeah, I left him right here. Joe!

20:51.375 --> 20:53.709
Mr. McGee!

20:53.792 --> 20:55.792
Joe McGee?

21:00.834 --> 21:02.709
Baloo, are you OK?

21:02.792 --> 21:04.667
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.250
We got to find Joe.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.250
You won't find him here, son.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.291
Nobody's used this field in years.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.458
Not since the landslide
nearly blocked the entrance.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.208
But I left him not half an hour ago.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.208
Look. Here's his cane.

21:22.291 --> 21:26.625
Joe wrecked his leg
saving a crew from a burning plane.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.083
[doctor] <i>That bum leg</i>
<i>grounded him for life.</i>

21:29.166 --> 21:31.667
<i>That's when he opened</i>
<i>this flight school.</i>

21:31.750 --> 21:34.041
They say he trained the best.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.458
Some say he was the best.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.750
What do you mean was?

21:38.834 --> 21:43.041
Son, Joe McGee passed away 20 years ago.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.750
Thanks, Joe.

22:01.125 --> 22:05.208
Who's that, Baloo? A friend of yours?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.625
[Baloo] More than a friend, kid.

22:07.709 --> 22:10.208
More like a guardian angel.

22:10.291 --> 22:11.917
[Joe] <i>Look around you, Baloo.</i>

22:12.000 --> 22:14.333
<i>You're free as a bird.</i>
