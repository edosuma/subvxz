<b>Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.</b>

00:06.890 --> 00:10.480
<b>Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!</b>

00:11.390 --> 00:16.530
<b>My guess is that when I was a 
baby, I came here with Ging.</b>

00:18.130 --> 00:21.390
<b>He was probably trying to tell me this:</b>

00:22.460 --> 00:25.670
<b>If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,</b>

00:25.670 --> 00:28.650
<b>I have to get strong enough 
to clear the game...</b>

00:29.700 --> 00:32.510
<b>Well? What will you do once you find Ging?</b>

00:32.910 --> 00:35.630
<b>Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!</b>

00:36.390 --> 00:38.970
<b>My best friend in the world!</b>

02:53.860 --> 02:55.570
<b>G-Ging...</b>

03:15.670 --> 03:17.770
<b>I got a slot machine in my mouth!</b>

03:17.770 --> 03:19.510
<b>It goes from 1 to 9.</b>

03:19.510 --> 03:21.940
<b>Each number summons a different weapon.</b>

<b>4!</b>

03:31.960 --> 03:33.440
<b>Damn, bad roll.</b>

03:34.510 --> 03:35.310
<b>Shut up!</b>

03:35.310 --> 03:37.320
<b>You should be grateful, you idiot!</b>

03:45.810 --> 03:47.000
<b>An ant?</b>

03:47.340 --> 03:48.530
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

04:02.760 --> 04:05.500
<b><i>Is that Ging?</i></b>

04:19.260 --> 04:20.660
<b>That isn't Ging...</b>

04:23.860 --> 04:24.880
<b>Hey...</b>

04:24.880 --> 04:26.320
<b>What was that about?</b>

04:26.970 --> 04:30.270
<b>First you push us down, then you fire at us!</b>

04:30.270 --> 04:31.940
<b>Enough fooling around!</b>

04:32.260 --> 04:33.570
<b>Fooling around?</b>

04:33.570 --> 04:35.010
<b>I was being dead serious.</b>

04:35.470 --> 04:39.440
<b>If I hadn't opened fire, 
you would have been attacked.</b>

04:39.440 --> 04:40.660
<b>By what?!</b>

04:40.660 --> 04:42.970
<b>The ant you shot?</b>

04:46.430 --> 04:47.360
<b>Ow!</b>

04:49.870 --> 04:51.390
<b>What is this?</b>

04:51.720 --> 04:52.890
<b>Idiot!</b>

05:06.150 --> 05:08.020
<b>That's no ordinary ant.</b>

05:08.020 --> 05:09.440
<b>It's a Chimera Ant.</b>

05:09.440 --> 05:10.840
<b>A Chimera Ant?</b>

05:10.840 --> 05:15.680
<b>An aggressive, carnivorous insect, 
currently under class-1 quarantine.</b>

05:16.910 --> 05:19.720
<b>From time to time, they even attack humans.</b>

05:20.970 --> 05:25.110
<b>You were standing right in front of their nest.</b>

05:25.110 --> 05:27.420
<b>Had I not fired,</b>

05:27.420 --> 05:31.250
<b>a Chimera Ant army would 
have consumed you by now.</b>

05:35.530 --> 05:38.910
<b>I feel like this has happened before...</b>

05:46.340 --> 05:48.840
<b>Don't worry, it's not serious.</b>

05:48.840 --> 05:50.070
<b>Apply this.</b>

05:50.070 --> 05:51.240
<b>It's an antibiotic.</b>

05:52.430 --> 05:54.350
<b>What? That's it?</b>

05:54.350 --> 05:56.610
<b>Let's go nuts, man!</b>

05:56.610 --> 05:58.910
<b>Shut up... Go away.</b>

06:00.220 --> 06:02.420
<b>You should leave, as well.</b>

06:03.280 --> 06:04.350
<b>Damn...</b>

06:04.350 --> 06:07.080
<b>Because of this interruption, 
I'll need to start over.</b>

06:07.080 --> 06:09.510
<b>But the nest was destroyed.</b>

06:09.820 --> 06:12.390
<b>Man, forced to take another life...</b>

06:12.780 --> 06:13.520
<b>Ah!</b>

06:27.160 --> 06:31.260
<b><i>Man, forced to take another life...</i></b>

06:34.500 --> 06:35.830
<b>Are you...</b>

06:36.240 --> 06:37.580
<b>Are you the one</b>

06:38.230 --> 06:40.040
<b>who saved me back then?</b>

06:40.690 --> 06:41.860
<b>Back then?</b>

06:42.230 --> 06:46.690
<b>On Whale Island, after I stumbled into 
the territory of a Foxbear with its cub.</b>

06:48.120 --> 06:49.090
<b>Whale Island?</b>

06:49.480 --> 06:50.770
<b>That time, too,</b>

06:50.770 --> 06:53.810
<b>you had to kill, in order to protect me.</b>

07:06.590 --> 07:09.450
<b>Oh, yes. I remember now.</b>

07:09.860 --> 07:12.660
<b>I never expected to run into you again here.</b>

07:13.400 --> 07:16.330
<b>You've grown, Gon.</b>

07:17.550 --> 07:19.460
<b>How do you know my name?</b>

07:19.460 --> 07:21.520
<b>I heard it from your dad,</b>

07:21.520 --> 07:22.670
<b>Ging-san.</b>

07:23.470 --> 07:25.880
<b>Old man, you know Ging?</b>

07:25.880 --> 07:26.860
<b>Old...</b>

07:29.050 --> 07:31.250
<b>Yeah, my name is Kite.</b>

07:31.250 --> 07:32.840
<b>Ging-san was my master.</b>

08:19.590 --> 08:24.080
<b>Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?</b>

08:24.080 --> 08:26.280
<b>Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?</b>

08:26.280 --> 08:27.770
<b>Call me Kite.</b>

08:27.770 --> 08:30.300
<b>It's awkward being addressed 
formally by my master's son.</b>

08:30.730 --> 08:31.670
<b>Okay.</b>

08:31.670 --> 08:33.360
<b>Then, you're one too, Kite?</b>

08:33.360 --> 08:37.990
<b>Yeah, Ging-san was the one who 
made me a top-class Hunter.</b>

08:38.400 --> 08:41.230
<b>He was my teacher and benefactor.</b>

08:43.360 --> 08:45.470
<b>If I hadn't met Ging-san,</b>

08:45.470 --> 08:50.050
<b>I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum.</b>

09:16.610 --> 09:18.120
<b><i>Wait up!</i></b>

09:18.490 --> 09:19.660
<b><i>Damned brat!</i></b>

09:20.490 --> 09:24.790
<b><i>He swiped the bread that 
I'd managed to find...</i></b>

09:25.090 --> 09:27.040
<b><i>He isn't escaping today.</i></b>

09:54.870 --> 09:56.480
<b><i>My bread!</i></b>

09:56.480 --> 09:57.450
<b><i>Bastard,</i></b>

09:57.450 --> 09:58.950
<b><i>you won't get away today!</i></b>

10:01.680 --> 10:02.420
<b><i>Ow!</i></b>

10:02.420 --> 10:03.830
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

10:03.830 --> 10:04.990
<b><i>What are you doing?</i></b>

10:04.990 --> 10:06.120
<b><i>Stop it...</i></b>

11:09.820 --> 11:12.700
<b><i>You live with these guys?</i></b>

11:12.700 --> 11:13.650
<b><i>That sounds fun.</i></b>

11:22.900 --> 11:26.120
<b>That was how you met Ging?</b>

11:26.920 --> 11:27.920
<b>Yeah...</b>

11:29.150 --> 11:33.670
<b>Ging-san said that good Hunters 
are well-liked by animals.</b>

11:34.060 --> 11:37.890
<b>He said I had potential, so I got interested.</b>

11:38.420 --> 11:39.880
<b>And you became his student?</b>

11:39.880 --> 11:41.780
<b>I had to force him to teach me.</b>

11:41.780 --> 11:45.420
<b>He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...</b>

11:45.420 --> 11:48.500
<b>So I was never his student officially.</b>

11:49.830 --> 11:52.190
<b>But I was a stubborn one...</b>

11:52.580 --> 11:54.520
<b>I kept bugging him.</b>

11:55.020 --> 11:58.570
<b>Eventually, I started to develop my <i>Nen</i>,</b>

11:58.570 --> 12:00.570
<b>and he began teaching me to hunt.</b>

12:01.930 --> 12:06.580
<b>As a result, I was able to pass the 
Hunter Exam with little difficulty.</b>

12:06.960 --> 12:12.210
<b>But before Ging-san was satisfied, 
I had to clear another hurdle.</b>

12:12.900 --> 12:14.960
<b>Can you guess what it was?</b>

12:19.010 --> 12:21.470
<b>I think I might know.</b>

12:21.810 --> 12:22.750
<b>Oh?</b>

12:22.750 --> 12:25.220
<b>No, I definitely know.</b>

12:26.220 --> 12:29.340
<b>This is what Ging would have said...</b>

12:29.640 --> 12:31.980
<b>"Try to catch me."</b>

12:33.950 --> 12:36.560
<b>Exactly. You're right.</b>

12:37.320 --> 12:39.360
<b>I knew it! I figured that was it!</b>

12:40.570 --> 12:44.740
<b>But as far as I knew, he was 
the world's greatest Hunter.</b>

12:44.740 --> 12:47.520
<b>It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.</b>

12:47.880 --> 12:50.960
<b>There were no clues or leads to begin from.</b>

12:51.360 --> 12:54.750
<b>And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.</b>

12:55.160 --> 12:59.880
<b>He'd managed to completely erase 
his existence from this world.</b>

13:00.740 --> 13:03.110
<b><i>Like a super-powered form of</i> Zetsu?</b>

13:04.510 --> 13:05.760
<b>So...</b>

13:06.120 --> 13:07.510
<b>So what happened in the end?</b>

13:07.510 --> 13:11.990
<b>I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,</b>

13:11.990 --> 13:14.020
<b>so I went to his home.</b>

13:15.020 --> 13:16.400
<b>To Whale Island.</b>

13:17.600 --> 13:20.610
<b>That was when I met you, Gon.</b>

13:23.150 --> 13:26.590
<b>But back then, I didn't realize</b>

13:26.590 --> 13:28.850
<b>that you were Ging-san's son.</b>

13:28.850 --> 13:32.190
<b>I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san</b>

13:32.190 --> 13:35.250
<b>and told him about what had 
happened on Whale Island.</b>

13:42.940 --> 13:45.780
<b><i>That was my kid... His name is Gon.</i></b>

13:58.150 --> 14:00.090
<b><i>Thanks for hitting him.</i></b>

14:00.990 --> 14:03.600
<b><i>It's common sense to avoid</i></b>

14:03.600 --> 14:06.990
<b><i>Foxbear territory when they're raising young.</i></b>

14:13.260 --> 14:15.390
<b>Ging-san wasn't surprised</b>

14:15.390 --> 14:18.830
<b>that I went to Whale Island, 
or that I met you there.</b>

14:19.470 --> 14:22.300
<b>It was almost as though he'd expected it.</b>

14:23.070 --> 14:24.580
<b>Looking back,</b>

14:24.580 --> 14:28.100
<b>it may be that everything's gone 
according to Ging-san's plans.</b>

14:28.800 --> 14:31.150
<b>Are you saying he set all this up?</b>

14:31.150 --> 14:32.550
<b>Well, I can't prove it.</b>

14:35.630 --> 14:37.140
<b>You might be right.</b>

14:40.120 --> 14:42.040
<b>Razor was waiting for me.</b>

14:42.690 --> 14:44.260
<b>And Dwun and List.</b>

14:44.770 --> 14:46.790
<b>Razor? Dwun?</b>

14:47.570 --> 14:50.530
<b>Yeah, in a game called <i>Greed Island</i>...</b>

14:50.530 --> 14:52.420
<b>It's a long story.</b>

14:52.420 --> 14:57.000
<b>In the game, a guy named Razor was 
waiting for me, at Ging's request.</b>

14:57.870 --> 15:00.480
<b><i>My son will come here one day.</i></b>

15:00.870 --> 15:03.040
<b><i>When that happens, give him a good beating.</i></b>

15:03.040 --> 15:06.520
<b><i>Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?</i></b>

15:06.520 --> 15:08.260
<b><i>Don't get too cocky.</i></b>

15:08.260 --> 15:09.690
<b><i>He is my son.</i></b>

15:12.400 --> 15:15.160
<b><i>Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.</i></b>

15:15.880 --> 15:19.820
<b>Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends</b>

15:19.820 --> 15:22.130
<b>who helped him create <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

15:22.130 --> 15:26.470
<b>Oh, Razor was also one of them...</b>

15:26.470 --> 15:30.420
<b>Anyway, those three were waiting for me.</b>

15:30.950 --> 15:33.780
<b>When I learned that, I realized something.</b>

15:33.780 --> 15:40.530
<b>If Ging planned for me to go to <i>Greed 
Island</i> and meet his friends,</b>

15:40.530 --> 15:47.190
<b>meeting Bisky and the others may have 
been another part of his plan.</b>

15:47.190 --> 15:48.800
<b>In that case,</b>

15:49.220 --> 15:53.640
<b>it's possible that Ging also planned 
that you'd meet Kite here.</b>

15:53.640 --> 15:54.470
<b>Huh?</b>

15:56.300 --> 15:57.860
<b>Oh, that's right!</b>

15:58.520 --> 16:02.000
<b>You must have been to <i>Greed Island</i> before.</b>

16:02.000 --> 16:02.990
<b>Me?</b>

16:02.990 --> 16:07.010
<b>Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"?</b>

16:07.010 --> 16:08.010
<b>Nigg?</b>

16:08.320 --> 16:10.670
<b>No, I don't recall that name.</b>

16:11.040 --> 16:12.070
<b>Wait...</b>

16:12.570 --> 16:17.830
<b>I do remember Ging-san taking 
me inside a game...</b>

16:17.830 --> 16:19.270
<b>I knew it!</b>

16:19.600 --> 16:21.130
<b><i>Greed Island</i>...</b>

16:21.130 --> 16:23.400
<b>Yes, I believe that was its title.</b>

16:23.740 --> 16:26.460
<b>But I can't remember if I used an alias.</b>

16:26.460 --> 16:28.230
<b>That must be it...</b>

16:28.230 --> 16:31.100
<b>Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.</b>

16:31.100 --> 16:34.250
<b>Damn! He tricked me!</b>

16:34.250 --> 16:36.470
<b>You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?</b>

16:43.490 --> 16:45.730
<b>Are you sure this was the right decision,</b>

16:46.040 --> 16:46.880
<b>Ging?</b>

16:47.950 --> 16:51.410
<b><i>Can you make it so that using 
Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,</i></b>

16:51.410 --> 16:55.330
<b><i>while using Accompany will send him to Kite?</i></b>

16:55.920 --> 16:57.220
<b><i>I can...</i></b>

16:57.910 --> 16:59.950
<b><i>Why do you want me to do that?</i></b>

16:59.950 --> 17:04.500
<b><i>If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on 
his own, I'm willing to meet with him.</i></b>

17:04.500 --> 17:08.660
<b><i>But I can't meet him if he's so gutless 
that he has to bring friends.</i></b>

17:08.660 --> 17:11.280
<b><i>Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?</i></b>

17:11.280 --> 17:12.560
<b><i>I don't understand.</i></b>

17:13.010 --> 17:14.930
<b><i>Never mind... Just do it!</i></b>

17:14.930 --> 17:17.470
<b><i>You'd probably just be 
embarrassed if he brought a crowd.</i></b>

17:17.470 --> 17:20.220
<b><i>Shut up! Just do it!</i></b>

17:23.430 --> 17:25.400
<b>He's so weird...</b>

17:25.400 --> 17:27.230
<b>Shy and stubborn.</b>

17:27.620 --> 17:29.440
<b>I feel sorry for Gon-kun.</b>

17:33.230 --> 17:34.490
<b>I understand.</b>

17:34.490 --> 17:40.580
<b>So the game <i>Greed Island</i> was 
created to train you boys.</b>

17:41.070 --> 17:42.790
<b>Only Gon, really.</b>

17:43.240 --> 17:45.500
<b>I just tagged along for the ride.</b>

17:45.500 --> 17:48.880
<b>That may have been part of Ging's plan, too.</b>

17:48.880 --> 17:49.850
<b>Even me?</b>

17:49.850 --> 17:52.330
<b>Nah, that's impossible.</b>

17:52.330 --> 17:53.260
<b>However,</b>

17:53.580 --> 17:57.170
<b>it appears that our meeting 
here wasn't coincidence.</b>

17:57.170 --> 17:59.600
<b>Yeah, I agree.</b>

17:59.940 --> 18:01.890
<b>There must be a deeper meaning to this.</b>

18:01.890 --> 18:03.320
<b>Meaning?</b>

18:03.320 --> 18:06.720
<b>Razor waited inside the 
game to make you stronger,</b>

18:07.150 --> 18:11.520
<b>so one would think Ging must 
have some role for Kite to play.</b>

18:12.340 --> 18:13.530
<b>A role...</b>

18:14.680 --> 18:17.730
<b>Your final test was finding Ging, right?</b>

18:18.140 --> 18:19.200
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:19.200 --> 18:21.280
<b>That sounds like a daunting task.</b>

18:21.690 --> 18:23.990
<b>The best Hunters in this world</b>

18:23.990 --> 18:27.790
<b>are masters of not only hunting, 
but concealing themselves as well.</b>

18:28.330 --> 18:30.050
<b>Yet you were able to find him.</b>

18:30.050 --> 18:31.120
<b>Oh...</b>

18:31.120 --> 18:33.420
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

18:33.690 --> 18:35.950
<b>Once you cleared your final test,</b>

18:35.950 --> 18:39.680
<b>Ging must have decided you were 
worthy of handling this.</b>

18:39.680 --> 18:41.900
<b>Handling this? Handling what?</b>

18:42.610 --> 18:45.670
<b>Handling what? Basically...</b>

18:53.810 --> 18:55.820
<b><i>Thanks for hitting him.</i></b>

18:59.050 --> 19:00.220
<b>Say, Gon...</b>

19:01.350 --> 19:04.470
<b>Want me to tell you Ging-san's 
current whereabouts?</b>

19:15.640 --> 19:18.090
<b>No, I'll find him on my own.</b>

19:19.900 --> 19:21.340
<b>A good response.</b>

19:23.210 --> 19:25.760
<b>Anyway, tell me about Ging.</b>

19:25.760 --> 19:28.520
<b>Tell me everything you know!</b>

19:55.380 --> 19:58.550
<b>How to help two-headed wolves breed?</b>

19:58.550 --> 20:00.740
<b>Ging is involved in that stuff?</b>

20:00.740 --> 20:05.750
<b>Sure, Ging-san is involved with a 
wide range of Hunter activities.</b>

20:06.440 --> 20:09.160
<b>He's never formally applied 
because he doesn't want</b>

20:09.160 --> 20:13.060
<b>to expend the energy, but he's as 
qualified as a Triple Star Hunter.</b>

20:13.540 --> 20:14.810
<b>Triple Star?</b>

20:15.250 --> 20:19.060
<b>Stars are awarded to Hunters who 
perform extraordinary tasks.</b>

20:19.430 --> 20:20.500
<b>Those responsible for</b>

20:20.500 --> 20:25.260
<b>historical discoveries or global 
achievements receive three stars.</b>

20:25.540 --> 20:28.710
<b>There are fewer than ten of 
these Hunters in the world.</b>

20:28.710 --> 20:32.460
<b>The title "Triple Star Hunter" 
is reserved for the very best.</b>

20:33.880 --> 20:37.600
<b>So Ging is as good as the best!</b>

20:42.590 --> 20:43.760
<b><i>Kite...</i></b>

20:44.560 --> 20:47.100
<b><i>A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.</i></b>

20:50.460 --> 20:53.350
<b>Ging-san is also famous</b>

20:53.350 --> 20:57.800
<b>for discovering the Lurka Ruins 
and the Kongo gold vein.</b>

20:57.800 --> 21:00.990
<b>Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!</b>

21:01.750 --> 21:03.430
<b>Kite, student of Ging...</b>

21:03.890 --> 21:05.400
<b>While his meeting</b>

21:05.400 --> 21:09.860
<b>with Gon and Killua signaled the 
beginning of a new adventure...</b>

21:13.340 --> 21:16.790
<b>On the Yorbian continent, in the 
southernmost of the Balsa Islands,</b>

21:17.370 --> 21:20.750
<b>a prologue to unparalleled fear</b>

21:21.580 --> 21:26.430
<b>was quietly but steadily unfolding.</b>

21:28.310 --> 21:29.530
<b><i>Not enough.</i></b>

21:30.200 --> 21:32.770
<b><i>These creatures are not enough, 
no matter how many I eat.</i></b>

21:33.150 --> 21:34.810
<b><i>But I cannot move...</i></b>

21:35.740 --> 21:36.940
<b><i>Stay calm.</i></b>

21:36.940 --> 21:39.900
<b><i>Focus on recovering my energy.</i></b>

21:40.820 --> 21:43.620
<b><i>I must heal before I can take the next step.</i></b>

21:47.930 --> 21:50.000
<b><i>I have a duty to fulfill...</i></b>

21:52.070 --> 21:53.500
<b><i>I must give birth to the King!</i></b>

21:55.850 --> 21:58.290
<b><i>I am the Queen!</i></b>

23:28.180 --> 23:30.460
<b>Next time: Unease x And x Sighting.</b>

23:30.800 --> 23:32.510
<b>Are you uneasy, Killua?</b>

23:32.510 --> 23:34.420
<b>D-Don't embarrass me!</b>
