00:00.047 --> 00:02.141
Previously on The Shannara Chronicles...

00:02.177 --> 00:05.094
The Ellcrys will bear a
seed that must be carried

00:05.180 --> 00:07.213
to a place called Safehold.

00:07.265 --> 00:09.265
In order to confront its power,

00:09.351 --> 00:11.551
you must learn to control your own.

00:11.603 --> 00:14.137
The Druid was a fool to send you.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.521
Aah!

00:15.557 --> 00:16.389
Bandon!

00:16.474 --> 00:17.890
That's the window from the vision.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.225
This is how we find the Bloodfire.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.777
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

00:20.862 --> 00:22.779
Eretria...

00:22.864 --> 00:24.147
Your body is the vessel.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.565
Your blood is the key.

00:25.617 --> 00:27.233
Don't let them leave without you.

00:29.371 --> 00:31.070
Proposition... your help

00:31.122 --> 00:32.070
in exchange for your freedom.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.623
That mark, what does it mean?

00:33.708 --> 00:35.575
I don't know, I've always had it.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.580
Arion, my father, all gone.

00:40.632 --> 00:42.915
And now you are King.

00:42.968 --> 00:44.667
All hail the King.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.587
- Now what?
- Now we find Safehold.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:14.215 --> 01:16.933
There has to be another way across.

01:17.018 --> 01:18.885
What about that?

01:18.937 --> 01:20.720
The yellow line.

01:20.772 --> 01:22.055
Do you see another path?

01:22.107 --> 01:23.890
The bridge was it.

01:23.942 --> 01:26.526
Well, I hope you're a swimmer.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.651
We're not going across.

01:35.904 --> 01:37.570
We're going under.

01:37.622 --> 01:39.706
There's a tunnel.

01:43.995 --> 01:45.461
It's almost dusk.

01:45.547 --> 01:47.296
We go in there now, we're
spending the night.

01:47.382 --> 01:48.965
If there are trolls down there...

01:49.050 --> 01:50.750
Would you rather sleep
out here in the open?

01:52.137 --> 01:54.420
That tunnel could be flooded.

02:30.258 --> 02:32.542
"Safehold."

02:33.878 --> 02:35.128
We made it.

02:35.213 --> 02:37.764
All right, let's go.

03:17.005 --> 03:19.088
She's alive.

03:19.974 --> 03:22.809
Amberle's alive.

03:22.844 --> 03:25.178
So what did you see?

03:27.348 --> 03:30.099
I don't know.

03:30.185 --> 03:32.685
I saw ruins.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.772
Like an ancient city.

03:35.857 --> 03:39.275
Man-made, not Elvin.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.860
I didn't recognize it.

03:40.912 --> 03:42.278
Was there anything else?

03:42.363 --> 03:44.197
- Think.
- I'm trying.

03:47.869 --> 03:49.202
There was water.

03:49.287 --> 03:50.586
Ocean or river?

03:50.672 --> 03:52.622
I don't know.

03:52.707 --> 03:53.506
I need a break.

03:53.541 --> 03:56.876
No, the Ellcrys is almost bare.

03:56.928 --> 03:58.010
If the last leaf falls...

03:58.046 --> 04:00.096
I know what happens!

04:00.181 --> 04:02.381
If you think I am pushing you,

04:02.467 --> 04:03.633
it's because I am trying

04:03.718 --> 04:05.468
to prepare you for what is to come.

04:05.553 --> 04:09.639
You must fortify yourself
against the Dagda Mor.

04:18.199 --> 04:21.149
You're pushing to see if I snap.

04:29.077 --> 04:30.910
It's not fun...

04:32.714 --> 04:35.081
having your mind read, is it?

04:37.135 --> 04:39.418
Your power may be growing,

04:39.504 --> 04:42.471
but be careful how you use it.

04:42.557 --> 04:44.590
And with whom.

05:26.187 --> 05:28.046
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:40.481 --> 05:43.566
It all looks the same.

05:43.651 --> 05:45.201
- What do you think?
- I'll head down here.

05:45.286 --> 05:47.486
You guys check that way.

05:47.538 --> 05:49.739
Double back in five minutes?

05:49.824 --> 05:50.706
Yeah.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.326
If you run into a
Troll, go for its eyes.

05:53.411 --> 05:54.794
It's their weak spot.

05:54.829 --> 05:56.495
Thanks.

05:56.547 --> 05:57.797
I should go with you.

05:57.832 --> 05:58.831
I'll be fine.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.133
Elfstones won't work
against Trolls anyway.

06:01.169 --> 06:03.502
And killing them isn't
exactly your strong suit.

06:03.588 --> 06:06.505
I think I liked it better
when you two weren't friends.

06:08.226 --> 06:10.843
Five minutes, not a second later.

06:19.354 --> 06:21.187
You said you were stepping down.

06:21.239 --> 06:22.438
You made a fool of me.

06:22.523 --> 06:24.440
You need to understand, Councilwoman.

06:24.525 --> 06:26.909
I have seen the evil that's coming.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.578
If we hope to survive,
I need you at my side.

06:29.664 --> 06:30.947
Your influence over the council

06:31.032 --> 06:33.833
would bring unity when we need it most.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.505
Your king needs you, Kael.

06:41.209 --> 06:43.509
You're no king.

06:43.544 --> 06:45.378
You're what's left.

06:51.052 --> 06:53.936
That went well.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.354
What did you expect?

06:55.390 --> 06:57.556
Well, I was hoping she'd be reasonable.

06:57.642 --> 07:00.476
She believes her cause to be just.

07:00.561 --> 07:02.561
But like all leaders,

07:02.613 --> 07:05.398
her judgment is clouded by ambition.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.616
Sounds like I should be worried.

07:07.702 --> 07:11.237
The wiser king always is.

07:58.836 --> 08:02.955
Hey, I said some things back at Utopia.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.007
I was upset,

08:05.093 --> 08:07.126
and I'm sorry

08:07.178 --> 08:10.296
about Tye, about all of it.

08:10.381 --> 08:11.764
Don't be.

08:11.799 --> 08:12.882
I was a fool.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.300
No, you weren't.

08:14.385 --> 08:15.801
It's okay to want to belong.

08:15.887 --> 08:18.304
I've spent my whole life as an outcast.

08:18.356 --> 08:20.306
I know how it feels.

08:20.391 --> 08:23.642
I just wanted to believe that
there was a place for me.

08:26.697 --> 08:29.281
But Tye turned out to be a liar.

08:29.317 --> 08:32.650
And Cephalo, he saved me.

08:32.703 --> 08:36.288
The guy I spent my entire
life running away from.

08:36.323 --> 08:38.957
It doesn't make any sense.

08:44.465 --> 08:45.915
When I was a kid,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.667
my dad would come home
from the tavern drunk.

08:48.753 --> 08:50.970
My mom wouldn't let him in.

08:51.005 --> 08:52.638
He'd just sit outside,

08:52.673 --> 08:56.058
yelling and banging on the door until

08:56.144 --> 08:57.676
he passed out.

09:00.515 --> 09:04.100
I was embarrassed of him.

09:04.185 --> 09:07.186
Then I find out he's this hero.

09:07.271 --> 09:12.024
That he destroyed himself
with magic to save us all.

09:13.327 --> 09:16.695
Point is, people are complicated.

09:16.747 --> 09:19.498
You can't beat yourself up over it.

09:19.534 --> 09:23.335
But at least you know the truth now.

09:23.371 --> 09:24.620
You know where you come from.

09:24.705 --> 09:27.039
All I have are questions.

09:29.594 --> 09:31.710
Guys, you gotta see this.

09:39.437 --> 09:40.803
They're asleep.

09:53.901 --> 09:55.568
No way.

09:55.653 --> 09:56.902
Is that...

09:59.874 --> 10:01.574
My tattoo.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.282
What's your tattoo doing on a wall

10:12.368 --> 10:13.917
beneath the ruins of a human city?

10:13.953 --> 10:16.453
That tunnel must lead to the Bloodfire.

10:16.539 --> 10:18.088
I agree.

10:18.124 --> 10:20.040
It... it can't be a coincidence.

10:20.126 --> 10:22.376
Maybe you guys didn't
notice, but there are three

10:22.461 --> 10:23.710
heavily-armed trolls in that room...

10:23.796 --> 10:25.129
how are we supposed to get past them?

10:25.214 --> 10:26.630
We've fought worse.

10:26.682 --> 10:28.265
Wait.

10:31.303 --> 10:33.387
Maybe there's another way.

12:55.114 --> 12:57.531
If the Gnome's letter is true,
it could turn the tide of war.

12:57.616 --> 12:58.782
Have you told the Council?

12:58.834 --> 13:00.117
No one knows but the two of you.

13:00.169 --> 13:02.419
Unless I can prove an
alliance with the Gnomes,

13:02.454 --> 13:03.704
the Council won't trust me.

13:03.789 --> 13:05.455
We must tread carefully.

13:05.507 --> 13:08.425
There are forces aligning
against the king.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.211
Kael intends to take the throne.

13:11.297 --> 13:13.630
Well, if Kael's on the move,
we need to stop talking

13:13.716 --> 13:15.599
and take her out, to protect Ander.

13:15.634 --> 13:17.217
Wouldn't do any good.

13:17.303 --> 13:19.436
Kael is a symptom.

13:19.471 --> 13:21.521
The disease is a lack of confidence.

13:21.607 --> 13:23.390
Until I can prove myself
worthy of the throne,

13:23.475 --> 13:25.058
the Council won't let me sit on it.

13:25.144 --> 13:26.943
Are you suggesting we let a coup happen?

13:26.979 --> 13:29.196
Kael Pindanon would not dare harm

13:29.281 --> 13:30.480
the son of King Eventine.

13:30.532 --> 13:31.615
How do you know that?

13:31.650 --> 13:33.233
Because there is still honor

13:33.319 --> 13:34.651
within these walls.

13:37.072 --> 13:38.455
This letter bears my seal.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.324
I need you to deliver it
to bring back the support

13:40.376 --> 13:41.908
I need to win over the Council.

13:41.994 --> 13:42.993
I'm not leaving you.

13:43.078 --> 13:44.328
This is my best chance

13:44.380 --> 13:45.495
to gain the Council's trust.

13:45.547 --> 13:48.799
They need to see me as a leader.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.917
Diana, please.

13:51.003 --> 13:53.470
You're the only one I can count on.

13:56.558 --> 13:58.008
Take it to Slanter.

14:20.999 --> 14:22.866
This is it.

14:40.052 --> 14:41.218
Ha!

14:47.393 --> 14:49.443
They've been at it for hours.

14:49.528 --> 14:50.694
Hope they can still hold their swords

14:50.729 --> 14:52.229
when the real fighting begins.

14:52.281 --> 14:54.531
This is nothing, you should try spending

14:54.566 --> 14:55.732
a whole day with the Druid.

14:55.784 --> 14:57.451
Keep your shield hand high.

14:57.536 --> 14:59.569
You'll absorb the impact
with your whole body.

15:09.081 --> 15:11.581
Our enemy is aggressive.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.750
Utterly lacking in fear.

15:13.836 --> 15:15.302
They will attack with ferocity,

15:15.387 --> 15:17.421
but they will be reckless.

15:17.473 --> 15:20.056
We must be the opposite.

15:23.595 --> 15:24.928
Help me demonstrate.

15:26.315 --> 15:27.697
Um...

15:27.766 --> 15:30.400
I'm not much of a fighter.

15:30.436 --> 15:32.686
We're all fighters in this war.

15:46.461 --> 15:49.962
Show him your power.

15:50.048 --> 15:51.430
Do it.

15:51.516 --> 15:53.382
Be patient.

15:53.434 --> 15:54.550
Wait for an opening.

15:54.602 --> 15:56.886
You are strong.

16:00.558 --> 16:02.275
Take your chance.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.026
He is weak.

16:10.902 --> 16:13.069
He's weak.

16:13.121 --> 16:14.570
You're stronger than you look.

16:18.293 --> 16:20.876
He's no king.

16:20.912 --> 16:23.546
Kill him now...

16:30.421 --> 16:32.054
Finish him!

16:32.090 --> 16:34.423
Slit his throat!

16:34.509 --> 16:36.175
Kill him.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.427
Do it.

16:43.434 --> 16:44.900
Kill him.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.402
Aah!

16:50.158 --> 16:52.241
- Protect the king!
- Restrain him!

16:52.277 --> 16:54.410
Put down the sword.

16:54.445 --> 16:55.861
No...

16:55.947 --> 16:57.446
... all right?

17:01.953 --> 17:03.452
Hold him.

17:05.123 --> 17:07.089
What did you see?

17:09.042 --> 17:10.259
I don't know.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.128
I'm... I'm not sure.

17:17.551 --> 17:20.219
The boy is not himself.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.138
Let me speak with him.

17:23.223 --> 17:24.890
See that you do.

17:26.194 --> 17:27.777
Release him.

17:44.545 --> 17:46.912
Looks like someone was just here.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.667
What is this place?

17:51.719 --> 17:55.004
I feel like I've been here before.

17:55.089 --> 17:56.806
How could that be?

17:58.426 --> 18:00.509
I can't explain it.

18:16.778 --> 18:19.612
What is "Filii" and "Apocalypsi"?

18:23.534 --> 18:25.668
No idea.

18:26.871 --> 18:29.205
Eretria, do you recognize this language?

18:31.509 --> 18:33.876
Eretria?

18:33.928 --> 18:35.795
Your body is the vessel.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.963
Your blood is the key.

18:50.611 --> 18:52.228
You okay?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.230
I think so.

18:57.034 --> 18:58.534
I heard a voice.

18:58.569 --> 19:01.036
It said my blood is the key.

19:01.072 --> 19:02.488
What does that mean?

19:04.375 --> 19:06.242
I don't know.

19:08.246 --> 19:11.247
But I saw a place...

19:11.332 --> 19:13.382
like a temple.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.085
And that symbol was there.

19:16.137 --> 19:17.920
And the light, bright,

19:17.972 --> 19:19.505
like the sun.

19:22.477 --> 19:24.593
Eretria, you saw the Bloodfire.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.806
Sounds exactly like what
I saw in my vision.

19:27.899 --> 19:29.598
Aah!

19:49.620 --> 19:52.254
I know how to get to the Bloodfire.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.467
We're close. How do you know that?

20:05.552 --> 20:07.140
And what happened to you back there?

20:07.328 --> 20:09.361
I don't know how to explain it.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.262
It's like I can feel
the map in my blood.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.930
Like it's a part of me.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.816
That's the reason you were in my vision.

20:18.902 --> 20:20.651
Why the Ellcrys wanted you here.

20:20.737 --> 20:21.936
I thought it was to make sure

20:22.021 --> 20:23.437
you didn't get yourself killed.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.107
But sure, why not?

20:28.192 --> 20:31.326
So is this what it feels like
when you use your Elfstones?

20:31.361 --> 20:33.161
What do you mean?

20:33.197 --> 20:35.197
I feel invincible.

20:35.249 --> 20:37.365
I usually feel like
I've been set on fire

20:37.451 --> 20:40.202
or beaten with a shovel, so... no.

20:47.211 --> 20:49.461
This should be it.

20:49.546 --> 20:51.713
Nothing ominous about that.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.980
I feel like a pawn

21:09.066 --> 21:12.651
in a game I don't understand.

21:12.736 --> 21:14.202
Ever since I woke up,

21:14.238 --> 21:17.038
it's like I can...

21:17.074 --> 21:18.406
feel him.

21:18.492 --> 21:20.742
Who?

21:23.163 --> 21:25.213
The Dagda Mor.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.250
Its like he's inside my head.

21:30.137 --> 21:32.254
Making me do things.

21:33.423 --> 21:35.640
Whatever that thing wants,

21:35.726 --> 21:37.642
you'll fight it, okay?

21:37.728 --> 21:39.344
And you'll win.

21:44.518 --> 21:46.935
What about what I want?

21:51.575 --> 21:53.241
What do you want?

22:11.962 --> 22:13.962
What is it? What's wrong?

22:14.014 --> 22:16.798
Ugh... uh, nothing.

22:16.850 --> 22:18.133
Nothing, I just...

22:25.275 --> 22:27.309
I'm sorry.

22:27.361 --> 22:29.110
I'm sorry, I'm just...

22:30.864 --> 22:32.781
I'm just exhausted.

22:33.784 --> 22:35.984
Maybe you should get some rest.

22:42.793 --> 22:45.410
You're not getting away that easy.

23:01.928 --> 23:04.346
You're not getting away at all.

23:09.519 --> 23:11.519
Oh...

23:11.605 --> 23:14.356
Bandon... you're hurting me...

23:14.408 --> 23:16.024
Bandon, stop...

23:28.672 --> 23:31.039
Catania!

23:49.943 --> 23:52.193
We made it.

23:54.398 --> 23:56.314
Okay...

23:57.701 --> 24:00.068
so where is the Bloodfire?

24:01.655 --> 24:06.541
It's here... I can feel it.

24:08.128 --> 24:10.912
In my vision, you guys were
standing beneath the window.

24:12.582 --> 24:14.332
Wil on the left.

24:28.482 --> 24:31.232
And...

24:31.268 --> 24:32.567
nothing.

24:37.607 --> 24:39.107
I take that back.

24:48.118 --> 24:50.585
I guess this means we're
in the right place.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.421
Now what?

24:54.458 --> 24:56.124
I don't know.

25:00.013 --> 25:02.130
But we need to figure it out.

25:06.136 --> 25:08.636
No one enters, no one leaves...

25:08.722 --> 25:10.305
Wait, do you hear that?

25:14.444 --> 25:16.277
No one enters.

25:18.231 --> 25:19.647
No one leaves.

25:19.733 --> 25:21.232
Who are you?

25:21.318 --> 25:24.319
Guardians of the Bloodfire.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.888
Who among you dares to seek

25:30.295 --> 25:31.911
...the Bloodfire?

25:33.048 --> 25:34.631
I do.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.916
Amberle Elessedil of Arborlon.

25:37.002 --> 25:37.968
Mmmm...

25:38.003 --> 25:39.836
Eles...

25:39.921 --> 25:41.304
...sedil.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.008
The Fire has power beyond
your wildest imagining.

25:45.060 --> 25:48.061
Death comes to those unfit
to bathe in its essence.

25:48.146 --> 25:52.015
What makes you think you're worthy?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.851
I was chosen.

25:54.903 --> 25:56.152
What are they telling you?

25:56.188 --> 25:57.771
You look scared, Princess.

25:57.856 --> 26:00.023
Is it because you fear the Fire?

26:00.108 --> 26:03.994
Or because the Halfling
still smells of her bed?

26:05.580 --> 26:07.364
Can you feel it?

26:07.416 --> 26:09.082
Yes, a strong magic...

26:09.167 --> 26:11.034
For such weak shoulders.

26:11.119 --> 26:13.003
You can't protect her, Halfling.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.838
You can't protect yourself.

26:14.873 --> 26:17.040
- Your mother.
- Dead.

26:17.092 --> 26:18.958
- Your father.
- Dead.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.177
Your heart.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.129
Undecided.

26:25.684 --> 26:29.135
No, they're trying to confuse us.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.553
Turn us against each other...

26:35.560 --> 26:39.696
Half-Human, half-Elf.

26:39.731 --> 26:42.148
Which one will it be?

26:54.913 --> 26:56.579
If we place more company to the north...

26:56.665 --> 26:57.997
What is this?

26:59.551 --> 27:01.251
I didn't call a meeting.

27:01.303 --> 27:02.886
Nothing you need worry about.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.804
I know what you're doing.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.306
And you won't get away with it.

27:06.391 --> 27:08.091
It's already been done.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.394
Without Commander Tilton in court,

27:11.430 --> 27:13.480
the Blackwatch have fallen in line.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.731
I have assurances the Council will

27:14.766 --> 27:16.766
ratify my ascension by nightfall.

27:19.521 --> 27:21.988
What you're doing is treason.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.573
Take him.

27:56.358 --> 27:58.608
Hello?

28:01.146 --> 28:03.897
Show yourself!

28:07.819 --> 28:11.654
That's far enough, Commander.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.458
How did you know where to find us?

28:15.494 --> 28:17.994
The King sent me.

28:19.714 --> 28:22.298
What does Eventine know of our plans?

28:27.472 --> 28:29.839
Eventine's dead.

28:31.059 --> 28:33.009
Arion too.

28:37.315 --> 28:40.233
King Ander sent me to
deliver this to you.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.519
He's assumed the throne.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.528
Not for long, it seems.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.280
I've convinced the other tribes

28:54.366 --> 28:55.999
to fight the Demons.

28:56.034 --> 28:59.586
I wasn't expecting an Elvin civil war.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.704
No one was.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.707
Now...

29:04.793 --> 29:07.627
will you help us?

29:14.469 --> 29:16.719
The Princess saves the world.

29:16.805 --> 29:19.055
The Princess gets the boy.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.558
The Princess gets everything.

29:21.643 --> 29:24.194
Happily ever after!

29:25.447 --> 29:27.447
They don't trust you.

29:27.532 --> 29:28.731
They pity you.

29:28.783 --> 29:30.400
Like a stray dog.

29:30.452 --> 29:34.237
All alone and... Unwanted.

29:37.659 --> 29:40.076
You don't get to have it all.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.295
Eretria.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.464
What are you doing?

29:44.549 --> 29:45.915
Put the knife down.

29:45.967 --> 29:47.500
Don't let them get to you.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.552
I gave up my freedom.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.221
You?

29:52.591 --> 29:55.091
You haven't given up anything.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.644
All you do is take.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.479
You lie, and you steal,

29:59.564 --> 30:03.600
and you bat your lashes, and
you suck the world dry.

30:03.685 --> 30:05.818
Stop it, don't you see what's happening?

30:05.904 --> 30:07.437
They're messing with your minds.

30:07.489 --> 30:08.905
You spoiled bitch.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.990
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me!

30:11.076 --> 30:14.110
And you'd be rotting in
the bowels of a Fury!

30:15.697 --> 30:17.113
No! No!

30:17.198 --> 30:19.449
Aah!

30:19.501 --> 30:21.284
Eretria, I'm sorry.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.705
Now you know the truth.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.174
It's you or them.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.793
Make your choice.

30:31.713 --> 30:34.380
Eretria. Your hand.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.228
What's happening to me?

30:51.483 --> 30:53.900
She is a child...

30:53.985 --> 30:55.818
Of the Armageddon.

30:55.904 --> 30:58.905
My body is the vessel...

31:00.792 --> 31:02.992
My blood is the key.

31:10.135 --> 31:12.001
Aah!

31:35.781 --> 31:37.915
Where is Catania?

31:37.950 --> 31:39.333
She is safe.

31:39.418 --> 31:42.586
And that is all you need to know.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.491
You took her away.

31:49.762 --> 31:50.961
Why?

31:51.013 --> 31:53.714
If you truly care for her,

31:53.799 --> 31:56.133
you must let her go.

31:57.603 --> 32:00.354
He's lying to you.

32:02.058 --> 32:03.440
You had no right!

32:03.476 --> 32:06.977
The Dagda Mor will exploit any weakness,

32:07.029 --> 32:09.313
and your feelings for the girl

32:09.398 --> 32:11.732
have made you vulnerable.

32:14.654 --> 32:16.987
No.

32:17.039 --> 32:18.289
I can fight him.

32:20.493 --> 32:22.209
Kill him.

32:22.295 --> 32:24.628
He's lying to you.

32:24.664 --> 32:26.881
You must fortify yourself.

32:29.168 --> 32:30.634
Fortify yourself.

32:41.847 --> 32:45.349
You talk about my gift.

32:47.186 --> 32:50.154
You tell me I'm important,

32:50.189 --> 32:54.525
and then you use me and toss me aside.

32:54.577 --> 32:57.695
You sent me to that thing.

32:57.747 --> 33:00.030
To my imprisonment.

33:01.117 --> 33:03.834
Demons may have killed my family,

33:03.869 --> 33:05.703
but you...

33:05.755 --> 33:08.289
you have taken everything else.

33:08.374 --> 33:11.342
Everything I have done, I
have done for the safety

33:11.377 --> 33:15.379
of the Four Lands... and to protect you.

33:15.431 --> 33:19.183
You're nothing but an outcast
from an Order of dead men.

33:20.853 --> 33:23.220
Maybe it's time you joined them.

33:30.229 --> 33:33.814
This is not you, Bandon.

33:33.899 --> 33:37.234
No, Allanon, this is me.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.987
Stronger than anyone could ever imagine.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.407
Stronger than you, even.

33:58.424 --> 34:00.507
I am sorry.

34:00.593 --> 34:03.093
For everything I have done.

34:05.097 --> 34:07.765
And all that is yet to come.

34:21.914 --> 34:23.614
Who's there?

34:29.839 --> 34:31.455
Thank you.

34:34.293 --> 34:35.592
I'm sorry about your kin.

34:35.628 --> 34:37.960
But I believe you are the ruler

34:38.014 --> 34:39.346
the Four Lands needs.

34:39.431 --> 34:41.681
I hope you're right.
How many are with you?

34:41.766 --> 34:42.882
5,000.

34:42.967 --> 34:44.802
In the caves beyond the city.

34:44.887 --> 34:46.387
It's quite a sight.

34:46.472 --> 34:48.472
My men await your orders.

34:48.524 --> 34:50.139
King.

34:52.194 --> 34:53.393
We move tonight.

34:53.478 --> 34:55.396
Gather your men.

35:07.326 --> 35:09.326
It's the Bloodfire.

35:10.246 --> 35:11.378
I need to get inside!

35:11.464 --> 35:12.996
We will not let you steal

35:13.049 --> 35:14.131
the power of the Bloodfire!

35:14.166 --> 35:15.466
She's the one!

35:15.501 --> 35:17.634
Kill the bearer of the seed!

35:19.422 --> 35:21.638
Run for the flame. I'll cover you.

35:21.674 --> 35:23.223
Now go!

35:23.309 --> 35:25.426
Don't let her get away!

35:26.345 --> 35:29.179
Hey! Hey! Crazy ladies!

35:36.188 --> 35:38.689
Now go! Go!

36:09.638 --> 36:12.556
Amberle!

36:19.106 --> 36:21.323
We must fortify the palace
and prepare for a siege.

36:21.359 --> 36:22.441
And the Sanctuary?

36:22.526 --> 36:24.693
The Ellcrys is beyond saving.

36:24.779 --> 36:26.996
You're wrong.

36:27.031 --> 36:29.865
The Ellcrys is this city's only chance.

36:31.502 --> 36:34.036
What are those creatures doing here?

36:34.121 --> 36:35.421
The Gnomes come in peace,

36:35.506 --> 36:37.840
to fight the Demons as our allies.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.675
They've pledged an oath to the King.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.176
The true King.

36:41.212 --> 36:44.013
The Gnomes are not our enemy.

36:44.048 --> 36:45.681
The Dagda Mor is.

36:45.716 --> 36:47.633
And he will not cease

36:47.718 --> 36:50.602
until every race of the Four Lands

36:50.688 --> 36:52.771
is destroyed.

36:52.857 --> 36:54.556
We don't need to face this alone.

36:55.943 --> 36:57.393
With the Gnomes' help,

36:57.445 --> 36:59.478
we can protect the Sanctuary
until Amberle returns...

36:59.563 --> 37:02.481
Madness! The Princess
is likely dead already.

37:02.566 --> 37:03.866
She lives.

37:03.901 --> 37:06.068
And when she returns with the seed,

37:06.153 --> 37:08.320
we shall restore the Forbidding.

37:08.406 --> 37:11.707
That is the only way to win this war.

37:32.263 --> 37:34.346
Forgive us, Your Grace.

37:34.432 --> 37:36.598
Forgive us, Your Grace.

37:37.985 --> 37:39.568
All hail, King Ander.

37:39.603 --> 37:42.237
All hail, King Ander.

37:42.273 --> 37:46.024
If we fall, we fall together.

37:58.456 --> 38:00.122
Amberle?

38:01.542 --> 38:03.092
Amberle!

38:04.261 --> 38:06.762
Eretria, we have to
get her out of there!

38:11.635 --> 38:13.635
Eretria?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.640
Come on.

38:18.726 --> 38:20.976
Hey, come on.

38:21.028 --> 38:22.478
Hey, wake up.

38:36.327 --> 38:37.576
No.
