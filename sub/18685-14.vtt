00:01.935 --> 00:03.237
BEN (screaming in distance):
Stop it!
(Mickey slurping liquid)

00:03.271 --> 00:04.705
CHIP: Give it back!
SABRINA:
Ben, stop running away from me.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.407
BEN: Don't take that!
Put it back on!

00:06.440 --> 00:08.008
SABRINA: Where did you get that?
CHIP: Hold still.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.510
(loud crashing)
BEN: Just go away!

00:09.543 --> 00:11.045
CHIP:
If you don't give that back
right now...

00:11.079 --> 00:12.813
BEN (banging on door):
Aunt Mickey, open up! Quick!

00:12.846 --> 00:15.216
No! No, Mickey's
not in right now.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.417
CHIP: I'll kill you!
BEN (screams): Help!

00:16.450 --> 00:18.152
You're dead!
No...!

00:18.186 --> 00:19.820
Ben, what? Are you okay?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.689
Are you okay?
Ben, get over here,
you little... Wha...

00:21.722 --> 00:22.890
Whoa.
What the...?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.392
What is going on in here?

00:24.425 --> 00:26.494
Are you eating out
of the toilet?

00:26.527 --> 00:27.695
No, I'm not eating
out of the toilet.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.896
I'm eating on the toilet.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.098
Oh, okay, 'cause you can get

00:30.131 --> 00:31.432
very, very sick that way.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.934
Okay, thank you for
that helpful reminder, Alba.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.069
No, I just
wanted a break

00:35.103 --> 00:37.271
from all of you, okay?
And this is my last sanctuary.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.206
Or it was. What?

00:38.239 --> 00:39.507
What's going on? What?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.041
Ben stole my diamonds.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.843
I need stars
for my solar system.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.278
He needs stars for
his solar system.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.180
Tough crap. Those
earbuds are for my jams,

00:46.214 --> 00:47.115
not "satellites"

00:47.148 --> 00:49.083
in some kid's
crappy diorama.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.719
They said to find objects
from home.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.221
I see you found my lighter.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.423
Whoa, hold on, Ben.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.125
Where'd you get all these?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.126
Daddy's closet.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.860
Well, these aren't toys.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.462
These are not to be toyed with.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.730
W-Why? What are they?

01:04.132 --> 01:05.866
They're a sign,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.268
is what they are,

01:07.301 --> 01:09.537
and when the universe
gives you a sign,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.472
it's not up to you to ignore it.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.740
Okay.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.542
New plan: I am going to take

01:14.575 --> 01:16.244
a true time-out from you guys.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.579
And, uh, if you need me, eh...

01:18.612 --> 01:20.148
just don't.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.549
Where are you going?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.284
I'm going to the casino.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.386
I'm passing the baton
to Alba while I'm gone.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.487
Oh, what baton?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.888
It's a figure of speech.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.123
It just means you're in charge
while I'm gone.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.292
Do I actually get
to hold a baton, or...?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.294
Do you need to hold
a baton to be a...

01:33.327 --> 01:35.296
You said it was a baton.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.497
I should hold something.
Yeah, yeah. Here, here we go.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.132
How's that? That looks
like a baton. Sound good?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.500
Okay.
Great.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.103
But... but my project
is due tomorrow.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.972
Don't even worry about it, Ben.
By this time tomorrow,

01:45.005 --> 01:49.610
this solar system, it's gonna be
an entire frickin' galaxy.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.145
Okay, you heard the lady.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.613
I'm calling the shots now.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.815
It's a pepper grinder.
It changes nothing.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.351
It changes everything, Sabrina.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.320
(chuckles)
What's with the pepper grinder?

01:59.353 --> 02:01.989
Mickey gave it to me.
It means I am in charge.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.191
What?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.925
How come you get it?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.761
Just to be clear, we're talking
about a pepper grinder, right?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.530
That, like, grinds pepper?

02:09.563 --> 02:11.999
Yeah, and I'm not comfortable
with the whole arrangement.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.367
Where's Mickey?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.336
Taking a time-out at the casino.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.337
The casino?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.038
Have you lost your minds?

02:18.071 --> 02:21.542
This woman is a degenerate
scumbag gambling addict.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.810
I once saw her
snort a fistful

02:22.843 --> 02:25.213
of trucker pills
and play Pai gow for a week.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.547
We got to go get her
before she bottoms out

02:26.580 --> 02:28.349
and sells her ovaries.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.952
Okay, you will go.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.287
Trust me, I would go,
but I'm self-banned

02:33.321 --> 02:34.822
from every casino
in New England.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.226
Well, I cannot go,
I cannot take Ben to a casino.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.560
Leave him here.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.161
Yeah, actually,
that's a good idea.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.330
I'll keep an eye on him.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.198
Give me the grinder,
I'll take care of it.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.368
No, I think I leave
Sabrina in charge.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.869
This is outrageous.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.371
I'm getting passed over again?

02:50.404 --> 02:52.373
It's a pepper grinder.
It means nothing.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.375
Then let me have it.
No.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.876
See, normally I'd make
a case for myself,

02:55.909 --> 02:58.212
but essentially you're fighting
over a kitchen utensil

02:58.246 --> 03:00.381
and a babysitting job,

03:00.414 --> 03:03.251
so I'll let you ladies
duke it out.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.187
Show me the money.
Big money.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.222
I am money.
I am a money monster...

03:08.256 --> 03:09.690
Ma'am.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.691
Please hurry.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.826
Can you not interrupt me,
please?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.829
Now I have to start over.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.830
Show me the money.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.198
Big money. Cash money.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.234
Money machine. Money ball.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.202
Uh, courtside seats,
celebrities.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.604
Being rich, helicopter.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.406
Seven out.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.040
Okay, put that down, come on.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.276
Fun time's over. Let's go.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.711
Alba? To what do
I owe this pleasure?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.079
I am rescuing you.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.248
Jimmy says you have
a gambling disease.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.417
I don't have a problem.
I'm just blowing off some steam.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.287
Well, Ben's diorama
has seen better days.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.621
DEALER: Seven out.
Agh. Yeah, I know.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.290
I-I'm down a few planets.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.458
That's okay, just means there's
a heater around the corner.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.427
You want to get in on this?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.929
Eh, I don't know.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.531
What, are you afraid
of the big bad casino?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.732
Does it scare you?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.301
Come on, you deserve
to take a time-out

03:53.334 --> 03:54.502
as much as anybody else.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.137
Well...

03:57.170 --> 04:00.541
Maybe we play a few rounds,
and then we go. Deal?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.810
Yeah, of course, deal,
what do you think,

04:02.843 --> 04:05.313
I'm gonna stay here all
afternoon with these animals?

04:05.346 --> 04:07.481
What, so... what,
I grab these?

04:07.515 --> 04:08.649
What, what are you insane?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.117
Not that side.
That's my unlucky side.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.251
Get on my right.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.653
Okay.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.289
Okay, look alive, everybody.
New shooter, hot dice.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.758
Sabrina?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.500
BEN:
What are you doing?

04:26.534 --> 04:27.901
Oh! F...

04:27.935 --> 04:29.770
Ha! Uh...

04:29.803 --> 04:32.773
Nothing. I was just, you kn...

04:34.542 --> 04:36.477
Why are you tied
to a leash?

04:36.510 --> 04:39.480
Sabrina tied me up so I couldn't
get into any trouble

04:39.513 --> 04:41.081
while she's out shopping.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.416
She tied you up like a dog

04:42.450 --> 04:44.184
and I'm the one
that's unfit to be in charge?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.086
Mm-mm.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.356
I got to get
that pepper grinder.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.358
How'd you like
to teach her a lesson?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.292
I gotta poop.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.327
Yeah, well, we could do both.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.871
This is ridiculous.
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.305
All right, all right.
Boing.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.340
You ready? Ready?
Yeah.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.675
Here's the game. Okay?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.510
You're going to stay in here,
and if Sabrina calls out

05:09.543 --> 05:12.380
or if Chip calls out,
hell, even if I call out,

05:12.413 --> 05:13.714
you're not gonna move.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.716
Okay? Just stay here.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.718
Don't show your little face.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.986
When do I really come out?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.621
When I have the pepper grinder
back in my hands.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.955
Where it belongs.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.024
Can you at least put
the leash back on?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.959
Why do you want the leash?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.728
I don't know, I just like it.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.530
Yeah, so do I.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.133
I mean, Mickey doesn't like it
too much, but I'm working on it.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.536
I will come back and check
on you at dinner, okay?

05:35.569 --> 05:38.839
In the meantime,
get in the basket.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.510
Yeah.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.177
BEN: Whee!
All right.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.749
Bye, Jimmy!

05:48.782 --> 05:50.551
(door closes)

05:50.584 --> 05:51.985
This is fun.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.522
Okay, shooter needs
a seven or 11.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
I'd like a two, three, or a 12,
but don't let that jinx you.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.426
What? Are you betting
against me?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.260
Waitress put four ice cubes
in my glass this time

06:00.293 --> 06:02.530
instead of three, I kind of feel
a cold front coming on.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.597
Come on!

06:03.631 --> 06:04.765
11 winner.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.866
Yay!
(cheering)

06:05.899 --> 06:07.435
(laughs)
Damn it!

06:07.468 --> 06:10.571
I can't catch a freakin' break
at this stupid ass game.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.773
Are you okay?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.775
Yeah, Alba, I'm fine!

06:14.808 --> 06:17.044
I didn't realize you were the
fun police. Sorry about that.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
Is this better for you,
Officer Chuckles?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.882
(cackles)

06:21.915 --> 06:23.784
No. Okay, maybe we go now.

06:23.817 --> 06:27.688
Yes, you want to go? Yeah,
by all means, you win. Again.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.389
Congratulations, ma'am.
That's quite a haul.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.559
Thank you. I got lucky.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.795
Well, on behalf of the casino,
we'd love to comp you a room,

06:34.828 --> 06:36.697
express our gratitude
for playing with us today.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.031
Oh, wow. That is very nice.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.467
Yeah. Yeah.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.901
Uh, we really must be going.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.603
What? What are you...

06:42.636 --> 06:44.438
You turn down
a free room?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.039
Well...
Wow. Wow, Alba.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.042
Having money has
really changed you.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.912
Okay, you are making me
really nervous.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.447
I mean, what are we
even talking about here?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.716
We're being offered
a free hotel room.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.250
Uh...

06:57.284 --> 06:58.586
Where there will be
no children to bother us,

06:58.619 --> 06:59.887
nobody's mouths to feed.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.622
They're gonna bring us
room service.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.057
Damn it, you make
a very good point.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.626
Come on,
let's go pop on some robes

07:05.659 --> 07:07.595
and just not have to deal
with anything.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.996
Okay, okay, o...

07:09.029 --> 07:10.230
Okay, okay.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.465
We do it. We do it.
That's my girl.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.500
Yeah.
Nice pivot.
Okay.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.301
Sir, please show
us to our room.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.469
You got it.
Please follow me.
Okay. oh...

07:15.503 --> 07:16.937
I'm gonna...
Oh, I can help.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.305
No, your hands are full.
What? No.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.474
Those are the... those are
the expensive-- Mickey!

07:20.508 --> 07:22.142
(moans)

07:22.175 --> 07:23.644
Mickey!

07:23.677 --> 07:24.678
(groans)

07:24.712 --> 07:27.481
Come on.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.117
Hey, Ben...
(clears throat)

07:30.150 --> 07:32.553
Yeah, that's not good.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.492
(huffs)

07:38.526 --> 07:39.960
Hey, Chip.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.329
Have you seen Ben?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.964
No. I've been
enjoying the freedom

07:43.997 --> 07:46.266
not having a pepper
grinder affords me.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.269
Right. Yeah,
he may have gotten lost.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.538
You mean you lost him.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.772
I don't know.
He got off his leash.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.173
You tied him to a leash?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.508
What is this, Florida?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.843
I had to go out for a few hours.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.511
What was I supposed to do,
leave him with Jimmy?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.146
Definitely not.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.213
Will you help me find him?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.349
Look, this whole pepper grinder
thing is insane.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.351
It's a second-rate seasoning
at best,

08:04.384 --> 08:07.521
and you guys are acting
like it's King Arthur's sword.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.489
That being said,
I really don't like the thought

08:09.523 --> 08:10.490
of Jimmy having it.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.659
The guy bugs me.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.060
(groans)

08:13.093 --> 08:15.062
Fine. I'm in.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.564
Oh...
(gasps)

08:16.597 --> 08:18.732
Wow. Yeah.
Oh. Yeah.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.367
This is nice.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.569
Yeah, this'll do.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.738
Ooh, let's get
into that minibar.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.675
Oh. You know, I am gonna call
the kids and check on 'em,
What?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.143
see if they're okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're not checking on the kids.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.412
We're here to relax. Those guys
are the opposite of relaxing.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.581
In fact, give me all your stuff.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.549
Oh. Why?
Come on. Because,

08:35.583 --> 08:37.217
you and I,
we're going off the grid.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.920
Oh.
Yeah. Trust me,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.221
it's for the best.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.990
We deserve it.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.725
The kids'll be fine.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.594
* All right, y'all

08:46.627 --> 08:49.563
* Pull up your friends,
it's Mix Master Whoopie Whoop *

08:49.597 --> 08:51.665
* He back once again

08:51.699 --> 08:53.100
* Now last time we made y'all
stand up *

08:53.133 --> 08:55.402
* We told you that
you didn't need to dance *

08:55.435 --> 08:57.738
* And you know that you got
your soul together *

08:57.771 --> 08:59.673
* So now that you got it
together *

08:59.707 --> 09:01.108
* We're gonna give it to you
like this here *

09:01.141 --> 09:03.110
* You ready for it?
Here we go *

09:03.143 --> 09:06.346
(laughs)
* You got to handle it

09:06.379 --> 09:07.915
* Come on now

09:07.948 --> 09:09.349
Hello?! Ben...
* Come on

09:09.382 --> 09:11.118
* Take what you need now

09:11.151 --> 09:13.420
* Come on now

09:13.453 --> 09:15.756
* We got to make it scandalous,
uh *

09:15.789 --> 09:18.425
* Come on now
(both scream)

09:18.458 --> 09:20.628
* Put that thing
where it need to be *

09:20.661 --> 09:22.395
* Whoo!

09:22.429 --> 09:24.264
* Put it where it need to be

09:24.297 --> 09:27.034
* Where it need to be

09:27.067 --> 09:28.368
* Put it where it need to be

09:28.401 --> 09:29.770
* Oh... oh, yeah, baby

09:29.803 --> 09:30.771
* Let me tell you
like this here *

09:30.804 --> 09:32.873
* Check this out
Wow.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.608
* Mama come pull out
the skillet *

09:34.642 --> 09:36.810
(grunts)
* Let a brotherman
take control *

09:36.844 --> 09:39.647
* Got to get ready for the...

09:39.680 --> 09:42.750
Mickey! Mickey!
(gasps)

09:42.783 --> 09:44.417
Oh.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.719
Okay, Mickey.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.254
¿Quieres a bailar?

09:47.287 --> 09:50.057
Vamos a bailar.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.825
Dealer showing queen.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.627
Okay, come on, let's go.
No more fun and games.
No, no. Not...

09:53.661 --> 09:56.496
Alba, not now, okay? I'm
in the middle of something. Hit.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.798
23. Bust.
Crap.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.633
Okay, sweet 16. Hit 'em.
24. Bust.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.969
Hit me on third base.
Another bust.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.637
Okay, king-slayer. Hit 'em.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.672
25. Bust.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.639
Couple of nines, feeling fine.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.107
Split 'em and hit 'em.
14.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.275
Hit.
Bust.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.177
(squeaks) Okay, that's cool.
One more.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.011
Hit it.
19.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.813
Stay.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.014
20.

10:14.047 --> 10:14.648
Son of a bitch!

10:14.682 --> 10:16.083
Ma'am, language.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.751
You see what you've done?

10:17.785 --> 10:20.487
You just come oozing up here
and hanging out on my left side?

10:20.520 --> 10:24.124
I-I had all this! I had all
this, and you made me lose it!

10:24.157 --> 10:28.696
Oh. Oh, I am sorry that I made
you lose all of my money!

10:28.729 --> 10:30.530
Now let's go!

10:30.563 --> 10:31.765
You have lost control.

10:31.799 --> 10:32.833
I've lost control?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.868
Oh, no, you dumb, dumb idiot.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.469
You've lost control!

10:36.503 --> 10:37.938
I was in control!

10:37.971 --> 10:39.539
Get away from me!

10:39.572 --> 10:40.874
Oh, is this how it's gonna be?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.342
Get!
Fine!

10:42.375 --> 10:43.877
But you leave me no choice.

10:43.911 --> 10:44.945
(gasps)

10:44.978 --> 10:47.715
Oh, you...
Okay. Okay.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.949
Come on. Excuse me.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.784
Sorry.
My bad, my bad.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.652
Let's not panic.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.722
Sir, I need your help.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.523
What seems to be the problem?
It is my friend.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.059
She has a gambling addiction,
and she refuses to stop.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.529
If we do not stop her, she
will keep losing and losing

11:02.562 --> 11:04.231
until she has
nothing left.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.333
All right. Come with me.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.902
(Alba muttering)

11:08.936 --> 11:10.904
Wait, are you kicking me out?

11:10.938 --> 11:14.074
We, uh, reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone.
I... But I...

11:14.107 --> 11:16.076
But...
Your friend'll be fine.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.012
But I don't...
Thanks for playing.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.722
All right, I checked
the tree house. He wasn't there.
Did you find him?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.724
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking under
the bed 'cause I found him.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.059
Idiot.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.894
JIMMY:
Yo! Benny boy!

11:33.927 --> 11:34.928
Oh, crap, that's Jimmy.
What do we do?

11:34.962 --> 11:38.498
We stall.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.268
Oh, it's the
pepper princess

11:41.301 --> 11:43.737
and her little salty
troll. Is Ben in there?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.773
I need to talk to him.
Yeah. He is.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.941
But, um, he's napping.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.076
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll just wake him up.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.077
No, no, no,
that's not a good idea.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.278
Because the last time
we woke him up,

11:51.311 --> 11:53.346
we... triggered a psychosis.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.949
Oh. Yeah.
Well, this is pretty important.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.218
What's so important
that it can't wait?
It's personal.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.854
You have to talk about something
personal with a seven-year-old?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.090
Yeah, I do. It's very personal.
Now step aside.

12:03.123 --> 12:03.757
No.
No.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.126
(chuckles)
Okay.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.727
Jimmy. No.
Stop. Jimmy, stop!

12:07.761 --> 12:08.896
(grunts)
Don't...

12:10.798 --> 12:12.399
Yeah.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.936
You have no idea where he is,
do you?

12:15.969 --> 12:18.371
He's... around.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.607
You've got some nerve
calling me irresponsible.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.943
And you put the grinder above
your own brother's safety?

12:24.177 --> 12:25.946
Do you have any idea what people

12:25.979 --> 12:27.147
on the Internet pay
for a kid like that?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.917
No.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.219
Yeah, well, obviously,
I don't either.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.923
But he's a fantastic kid, so I
would imagine it's pretty steep.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.794
Oh...
You don't deserve that.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.266
Everything's different now.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.836
Excuse me.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.470
Come on, black.
Let's go.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.840
Mama needs a black.
Black... Hawk Down.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.008
Black Lives Matter. Just...

12:55.042 --> 12:57.010
black. Give me...
give me a black.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.412
Black mama. Black, black, black,
black, black, black, black...

12:59.446 --> 13:01.481
Red seven.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.616
Red seven.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.485
Okay.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.454
(inhales)

13:08.521 --> 13:10.858
Okay.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.294
It all comes down to this.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.662
Come on, Mickey,
you can do this.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.664
You've accomplished a lot more
with a lot less.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.666
Hey! Hey!

13:19.699 --> 13:21.168
(whirring)

13:21.201 --> 13:22.369
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:22.402 --> 13:23.803
My chip's in there!
(whirring stops)

13:23.837 --> 13:25.038
Uh, excuse me?

13:25.072 --> 13:26.606
Your vacuum,
it just sucked my chip up.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.841
Miss, I'm just doing my job.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.109
Yeah, we're all just
doing our jobs.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.978
Can you rip the bag open,
give me my chip back

13:31.011 --> 13:32.312
so I can go back
to my job, please?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.613
Is there
a problem here?
Yes, there's a problem.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
The-the vacuum,
it just ate my chip.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.117
Uh, well, you-you
probably wouldn't want

13:37.150 --> 13:38.986
to eat that anyway.
There's a lot of foot traffic

13:39.019 --> 13:40.387
going through here.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.023
No, not-not that kind of chip.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.658
What? Why does everyone think
I eat from toilets and floors?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.227
No, a casino chip.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.863
Oh. Uh, how much money
are we talking here, ma'am?

13:49.897 --> 13:51.865
It was a five-dollar one.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.634
Okay, well, maybe you can,
uh, win some more

13:54.667 --> 13:56.236
at one of our tables.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.671
(chuckles, scoffs)
Wouldn't that be nice?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.140
Well, I would have to be
a magician,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.075
because that's the last
of my chips.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.912
Well, uh, if you don't have
any money, ma'am,

14:04.945 --> 14:06.880
I'm afraid you have no reason
to be here.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.681
Well, I'm not going anywhere

14:08.715 --> 14:11.251
until this chip-sucking
carpet jockey makes it right.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.419
Jared.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.554
It's pronounced "Garrett."

14:14.587 --> 14:16.523
Okay, shut your mouth.
Don't talk to me like that.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.091
Have manners. I'm a lady.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.426
Security, pit seven.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.161
Oh, you calling in the cavalry?
Okay, that's a...

14:21.194 --> 14:23.063
that's a gross overreaction!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.364
Everything's fine.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.934
I will show myself the door.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.869
In a graceful and classy manner.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.771
You might want to take notes.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.108
(both grunt)

14:37.410 --> 14:38.778
(vacuum motor whirring)

14:40.613 --> 14:42.749
(Mickey coughing)

14:43.783 --> 14:46.686
Order has been restored.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.956
(chuckles)
Ben.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.024
Yeah, all right.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.592
Hide-and-go-seek,
I'm it, you're it.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.361
Let's go.
Come on, dude.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.963
Let's...

14:57.230 --> 14:59.967
Oh.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.637
Huh.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.609
Ben.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.711
Jimmy.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.146
You're not fit to lead.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.581
The kid's better tied up

15:14.614 --> 15:15.983
than he is with you, but no.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You took him off the leash?

15:18.785 --> 15:21.621
No. It was complicated.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.822
I was there, but, uh...

15:22.855 --> 15:24.724
Yeah, I did. All right?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.059
But I should have had the
grinder to begin with,

15:26.093 --> 15:27.094
because then I wouldn't--

15:27.127 --> 15:28.795
Jimmy, Jimmy.
have done this.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.163
Where is Ben now?

15:30.197 --> 15:31.999
I don't know. We
lost him, he's gone.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.733
No, Jimmy, you lost him.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.735
I had him tied up
safe and sound.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.970
I mean, it wasn't...
No. You had him tied up

15:37.004 --> 15:39.639
like a little dog in
a park getting kicked

15:39.672 --> 15:40.740
by big kids at the...
Nobody likes it.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.941
All right, stop!
...with a needle in his arm.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.510
Stop! This is insane.

15:43.543 --> 15:47.080
Do you guys hear yourselves?

15:47.114 --> 15:50.617
Now. As your new leader,
I'm qualified to let...

15:50.650 --> 15:52.752
No. You know what? I'm done
with the leaders, all right?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.455
'Cause that little guy
is out there God knows where,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.424
doing God knows what to whom,
and I'm not gonna have...

15:57.457 --> 15:59.326
Jimmy. No.
You're spiraling, okay?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.961
Yeah.
Enough with the pepper grinder.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.631
We're gonna come up with a plan,
and we're gonna find Ben.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.765
Okay?
Yeah.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.966
But I just got the...

16:07.000 --> 16:10.037
Chip.
Fine.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.676
Yeah. We got to find him.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.645
As fast as we can.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.351
Uh, does this bus
go to River Sun Casino?

16:24.384 --> 16:27.187
Do you have the fare?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.356
I have these.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.658
It does now.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.245
Thanks for sticking around.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.480
It was not by choice.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.049
You stole my
purse with my keys.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.651
Yeah.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.155
Yeah, I'm-I'm pretty sure
those are gone...

17:02.189 --> 17:05.125
uh, forever.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.062
Look, I realize I did

17:09.096 --> 17:13.200
some pretty questionable
things in there today,

17:13.233 --> 17:16.503
but I-I just needed
a break, you know?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.539
Those kids are just
a-around all the time,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.941
and nothing I do
is ever good enough.

17:21.974 --> 17:25.645
I just felt like the universe
was giving me a sign.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.284
But I see now that the sign

17:31.318 --> 17:34.921
was that I've got
a gambling problem.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.055
Yeah. I saw that sign, too.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.462
Do you forgive me?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.698
Maybe.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.934
Just this once.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.103
Okay.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.806
Let's go home.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.945
Benito. What are--
Ben?

17:58.978 --> 18:00.213
What are you doing here?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.582
The universe
gave me a sign.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.288
Oh, well, that's-that's
pretty undeniable, you know.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.722
No, no, no, no, no.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.658
When you literally
just promised.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.126
I-I know, but th-that
was before, you know?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.128
E-Everything's changed now

18:15.162 --> 18:18.231
'cause this... eh, th-th-this
is a sure thing.
No.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.301
You must make a choice,
us or the casino.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.203
C-Come on.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.579
All right.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.314
You know, I'll-I'll see you
back home,

18:34.347 --> 18:36.249
'cause I feel
a heater coming on.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.650
Mickey!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.192
Come on.
Jimmy, let's just
call the police.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.159
No.
Why not?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.927
Because I don't believe
in the police.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.296
What?
Guys, guys.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.130
We're wasting precious time
and Ben is still out there.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.701
You're right.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.437
I am done with you two goofs,
and I'm gonna go find him.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.306
I'm taking the grinder with me.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.275
No.
Jimmy!

19:02.309 --> 19:03.376
(grunting)

19:03.410 --> 19:04.377
Get off.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.378
SABRINA:
Let it go, Jimmy.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.514
No, it's mine.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.350
Stop it, fools.
I'm the only one

19:10.383 --> 19:13.253
worthy of its power.
Ay, come on.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.823
Disgraceful.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.291
Come, Benito.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.359
JIMMY:
Well, wait a minute.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.727
Where's Mickey?

19:20.760 --> 19:23.296
Mickey didn't make it.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.197
Let's go.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.065
(Sabrina sighs)

19:26.098 --> 19:28.801
At least we found Ben.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.170
Yeah, and then
there's, like, a rabbit.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.506
And it goes around...
Hey, Benito, look.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.211
Any chance Mickey's fixing
my first one?

19:38.245 --> 19:39.879
Oh, buddy,
there's a better chance

19:39.912 --> 19:42.215
the other one's
in a Dumpster next to your aunt.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.684
(car horn honks)

19:44.717 --> 19:47.687
Rise and shine, ding-dongs!
Get out here!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.256
Yeah!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.225
Whoa!

19:52.259 --> 19:54.394
My God.
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.263
(gasps)
Aunt Mickey!?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.364
You know it, buddy.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.232
What's with the limo?
Oh, this thing?

19:59.266 --> 20:01.334
Oh, it's just compliments
of a heater.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.336
Holy crap. You actually won?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.505
Oh, I won, Alba.
I won so big.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.073
I caught a heater
so massive

20:07.106 --> 20:10.042
I almost combusted
on the spot.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.844
Hey, anybody want
a ride to school?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.414
Yes.
BEN: Yeah.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.716
All right.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.918
Cool!

20:18.951 --> 20:20.720
Aunt Mickey,
this is awesome.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.221
You like it?

20:22.255 --> 20:24.257
Well, I felt really bad
about destroying your diorama,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.225
so I thought I would
just make you a new one.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.927
Sweet. What'd
you get for us?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.530
Nothing. Wh-why?
Did you get me something?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.433
No.
Then what are we
talking about?

20:33.466 --> 20:36.303
I'm not sure this will
fit in Ben's classroom.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.737
Well, then we're just
gonna have to bring

20:37.770 --> 20:39.606
all the kids outside, right?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.907
And I guarantee
this is gonna crap

20:40.940 --> 20:42.309
all over their
found objects,

20:42.342 --> 20:45.144
'cause you found a limo.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.280
This is the
coolest diorama ever.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.881
Yeah, it's pretty great.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.883
I'm a bit confused

20:50.917 --> 20:53.252
what they're supposed to take
away from all this, though.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.756
Is this, is this
that gambling is good?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.458
ALBA:
That does
not feel right.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.160
You know,
maybe it is, um,

21:01.193 --> 21:02.729
don't ever give up.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.298
Or play till you win?

21:05.332 --> 21:08.301
Uh, it just kind of seems
like she shouldn't have won.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.502
Uh, yeah, but I did.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.838
I did win, you know,

21:11.871 --> 21:15.174
so maybe the lesson is
there is no lesson.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.509
It's just life.

21:16.543 --> 21:20.313
You know?
Just sort of happens.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.482
Yeah, it does.
