00:04.805 --> 00:05.706
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
GROUNDED FOR LIFE...

00:05.739 --> 00:08.409
BRAD, YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO TO SPACE CAMP NOW.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.710
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND...

00:09.743 --> 00:11.011
RIGHT HERE ON EARTH.

00:11.045 --> 00:14.315
I HAD A GIRLFRIEND
AT SPACE CAMP, REMEMBER?
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.751
LANA. THAT'S RIGHT.
LANA THE SPACE GIRL.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.554
UM, HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE 854 IS?

00:20.588 --> 00:21.822
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.823
OK.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.094
UM, YOUR NAME'S
NOT BY ANY CHANCE
LUNA, IS IT?

00:26.127 --> 00:29.597
NO, NO, IT'S LANA.
LUNA'S MY SPACE CAMP NAME.

00:30.298 --> 00:34.068
BRAD O'KEEFE,
ARE YOU ON THIS BUS?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.069
LILY?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.003
BRAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.539
I'M GOING TO SPACE CAMP
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

00:38.572 --> 00:42.210
I WAS UPSET.
NOW GET OFF THIS BUS.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.744
YOU CAN'T JUST
ORDER ME AROUND.

00:43.777 --> 00:47.381
OK! I'M ASKING YOU,
GET OFF THE BUS RIGHT NOW!

00:47.415 --> 00:48.516
NO.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.551
HAVE A NICE
SUMMER, LILY.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.620
BRAD...

00:53.321 --> 00:55.723
I'LL SEE YOU IN 6 WEEKS!

01:04.198 --> 01:05.633
MOM, CAN I GET
YOUR OPINION ON SOMETHING?

01:05.666 --> 01:08.736
SURE, HONEY, AS LONG
AS IT'S NOT ABOUT
BRAD'S POSTCARD.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.205
IT'S ABOUT THIS POSTCARD
FROM BRAD.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.508
WHAT'S HE GETTING
AT RIGHT HERE WHEN
HE SIGNS IT "LOVE YA?"

01:14.542 --> 01:17.245
LILY, WE HAVE BEEN
OVER THIS AND OVER THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

01:17.278 --> 01:21.549
WE'VE BEEN PRETENDING
TO CARE AS HARD AS
WE POSSIBLY CAN.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.450
WHY "LOVE YA?"

01:22.483 --> 01:26.354
WHY "LOVE YA?"
WHY THE "YA?"

01:26.387 --> 01:27.455
IT'S SHORT
FOR "YOU."

01:27.488 --> 01:29.190
"LOVE YA" ISN'T
"I LOVE YOU."

01:29.223 --> 01:33.594
IT'S VERY OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT THERE AT SPACE CAMP.

01:34.162 --> 01:37.365
SO HERE WE ARE
AT SPACE CAMP.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.399
YOU WANNA MAKE OUT?

01:38.432 --> 01:41.602
OH, YOU KNOW I DO.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.708
I ALMOST FORGOT.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.909
I HAVE TO SEND LILY
A POSTCARD.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.279
YOU DON'T STILL
CARE ABOUT HER, DO YOU?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.347
LET'S JUST SAY
I'M SIGNING IT "LOVE YA."

01:55.416 --> 01:58.286
WOW. IT ALL SEEMS
SO OBVIOUS NOW.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.153
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

01:59.187 --> 02:00.188
IF BRAD CAN
FOOL AROUND IN OUTER SPACE,

02:00.221 --> 02:05.626
I CAN GET SOME ACTION
RIGHT HERE IN STATEN ISLAND.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.795
HEY, SEAN, CLAUDIA.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.363
ED, WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:09.397 --> 02:11.632
YOU'VE BEEN GONE
FOR LIKE A MONTH, MAN.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.534
HOPE DUMPED ME.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.403
WHAT?
I'M--I'M SORRY.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.204
OH, GOD.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.738
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I TOOK THAT PAIN,

02:17.771 --> 02:22.810
AND I CHANNELED IT
INTO MY LIFELONG PASSION.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.184
STAND-UP COMEDY.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.286
MEN ARE LIKE,
"I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S FOR DINNER."

02:32.320 --> 02:35.356
WOMEN ARE LIKE,
"GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY APARTMENT,

02:35.389 --> 02:39.393
YOU CHEATING,
FREELOADING BASTARD!"

02:39.427 --> 02:41.295
WOMEN ALSO LIKE TO SHOP.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.864
IT WAS TOTALLY THERAPEUTIC.
I'M TELLING YOU, SEAN,

02:43.897 --> 02:45.499
IF YOU EVER BREAK UP
WITH CLAUDIA,

02:45.533 --> 02:47.501
YOU SHOULD TRY
STAND-UP.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.437
THANKS, EDDIE.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.404
WELL, YOU COULD
TRY IT, TOO, CLAUDIA.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.941
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE BUSY WITH THE KIDS.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.343
UNCLE EDDIE,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:55.376 --> 02:58.212
WHERE HAVE I BEEN?
I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD, JIM,

02:58.246 --> 03:02.483
WHERE LIFE IS LIVED
AND DREAMS ARE CHASED.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.684
SOUNDS COOL.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.219
WELL, IT'S
MORE THAN COOL, JIM.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.288
ON THE ROAD, THERE ARE
NO RESPONSIBILITIES.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.457
YOU LIVE IN THE MOMENT.
YOU ANSWER TO NO ONE.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.660
HOW IS THAT
ANY DIFFERENT
FROM YOUR LIFE HERE?

03:12.693 --> 03:15.396
WHY DO I BOTHER?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.833
UNCLE EDDIE, I WANT
TO GO ON THE ROAD.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.435
NO, JIM.
YOUR PLACE IS HERE.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.371
NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M TELLING YOU.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.505
THE ROAD'S CALLING ME.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.507
LET THE MACHINE
PICK IT UP.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.342
HEY, LILY,
HOW ARE YOU?

03:28.376 --> 03:31.312
BRAD SENT ME ONE POSTCARD
FROM SPACE CAMP,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.646
AND HE SIGNED IT
"LOVE YA."

03:32.680 --> 03:34.682
HE MUST BE
CHEATING ON YOU.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.817
AAH!

03:51.031 --> 03:52.733
ANYONE MIND IF I THROW IN
SOME LAUNDRY?

03:52.766 --> 03:56.437
WHAT, THERE'S NO
LAUNDROMATS ON
THE ROAD OF LIFE?

03:56.470 --> 03:57.505
HERE, EDDIE,
I'LL DO IT.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.772
I WAS ABOUT
TO THROW A LOAD IN.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.542
OH, WAIT. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.510
HONEY, I GOT IT.
OH....

04:02.543 --> 04:05.979
SEAN FINNERTY'S WIFE
DOES NOT DO HEAVY LIFTING.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.180
REALLY? UH, LAST WEEK,

04:07.214 --> 04:10.384
YOU LET ME DRAG AN OLD
MATTRESS DOWN TO
THE CHURCH DUMPSTER.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.953
DRAG, NOT LIFT.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

04:12.986 --> 04:17.257
FINE. YOU WIN.
YOU GET TO WASH
EDDIE'S UNDERWEAR.

04:18.025 --> 04:22.363
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU ALMOST NEVER WANT
TO DO MY LAUNDRY.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.665
GOD, LOOK,

04:24.698 --> 04:25.999
I DID SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID,

04:26.033 --> 04:27.935
AND CLAUDIA DOESN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.069
WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.671
I GOT HER PREGNANT.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.541
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
AND NOT HER?

04:33.574 --> 04:34.908
WELL, SHE WASN'T
FEELING WELL, RIGHT?

04:34.942 --> 04:35.809
SO SHE WENT TO
THE DOCTOR LAST WEEK,

04:35.843 --> 04:37.911
AND THE DOCTOR CALLED,
BUT SHE WASN'T HERE,

04:37.945 --> 04:39.313
SO I ANSWERED THE PHONE.

04:39.347 --> 04:43.617
I'LL BE BACK LATER.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.985
WE NEED BEER.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.056
HELLO?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.959
MR. FINNERTY,
THIS IS DR. PERRY.
IS YOUR WIFE THERE?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.060
OH, HEY, DOC.
SORRY, NO.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.895
SHE STEPPED OUT
FOR A SECOND.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.397
UH, IS EVERYTHING
OK?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.499
IT'S FINE.
JUST ASK HER TO CALL ME.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.767
DOES SHE HAVE MONO?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.934
NO.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.503
DOES SHE HAVE
A STOMACH VIRUS?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.170
Doctor: NO.

05:03.203 --> 05:03.871
DOES SHE HAVE
THE FLU?
NO.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.006
OH, MY GOD.
IS SHE PREGNANT?!

05:06.039 --> 05:08.041
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.109
DOES SHE HAVE STREP?
NO.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.044
THEN SHE'S
PREGNANT, RIGHT?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.680
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.715
GOOD-BYE.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.517
SO WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HER?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.419
BECAUSE IT'S, UH...

05:18.452 --> 05:20.120
IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.789
YOU SURE
GARY AND DONNA

05:21.822 --> 05:23.056
DON'T MIND US USING
THEIR HOT TUB?

05:23.090 --> 05:25.359
THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID
IT WAS OK.

05:25.393 --> 05:29.430
BY ASKING US TO FEED THEIR CATS
WHILE THEY'RE IN MEXICO?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.766
IT WAS IMPLIED.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.469
GOD, I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.004
NO. WE CAN'T.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.774
WHAT, BABY?
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.643
IS THIS YOUR BATHING SUIT?

05:42.676 --> 05:47.014
THOSE NAUGHTY JETS MUST
HAVE BLOW IT RIGHT OFF.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.950
OK. THOSE AREN'T JETS.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.018
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.154
NO, WE DON'T.
YOU CAN'T GET PREGNANT
IN A HOT TUB.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.089
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.630
HEY, COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HER
SHE'S PREGNANT THEN?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.765
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE HASN'T
HEARD THAT BEFORE.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.567
NO, THINGS ARE
DIFFERENT NOW, MAN.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.968
SHE'S--SHE'S FINISHING
UP SCHOOL.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.102
SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT
A NEW CAREER.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.237
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO WAKE UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

06:10.270 --> 06:14.842
AND CHANGE DIAPERS
AND THROW A BOOB
IN SOME KID'S FACE.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.878
SEAN, CLAUDIA'S
A SMART WOMAN.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.614
WHEN SHE FEELS A BABY
KICKING INSIDE HER,

06:20.648 --> 06:21.982
SHE'S GONNA KNOW
SOMETHING'S UP.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.184
I JUST HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL THE TIME IS RIGHT.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.519
YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT
BABIES,

06:25.553 --> 06:26.587
GET HER ON BOARD
WITH BABIES,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.922
HOW CUTE THEY ARE,
HOW MUCH FUN THEY ARE,
YOU KNOW?

06:28.956 --> 06:29.957
AND THEN WHEN SHE'S IN
THAT MIND SET,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.426
I'M GONNA TELL HER,
"HEY, YOU'VE GOT ONE
IN YOU."

06:32.460 --> 06:35.496
THAT'S HOW I'D WANT
TO HEAR IT.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.199
OH, MAN.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.734
HEY, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.803
OK. HURRY.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.171
HEY, WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.073
OH, THAT'S JOEY.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.508
IS THAT MOCHA JOEY,
THAT WEIRD GUY

06:47.541 --> 06:49.843
THAT HANGS OUT AT
THE COFFEE SHOP ALL THE TIME?

06:49.877 --> 06:50.944
HE WORKS THERE, MOM.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.213
NO. I HAVE SEEN HIM THERE
WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING, TOO.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.551
WHATEVER.
THE POINT IS HE'S
CUTE AND UNATTACHED,

06:57.585 --> 06:59.019
JUST LIKE ME.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.954
OH, WAIT. ISN'T BRAD
COMING HOME TODAY?

07:00.988 --> 07:04.858
HE SENT ONE POSTCARD!
WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.193
SO YOU WANT BRAD
TO SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER

07:06.226 --> 07:08.161
AND THEN THINK
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.632
ACTUALLY, IT'S GONE
FURTHER THAN THAT.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.833
AND YOU KNOW,
I JUST DON'T SEE

07:12.866 --> 07:14.067
WHY SOME PEOPLE
THINK THEY
SHOULD PAY

07:14.101 --> 07:14.902
MORE THAN
ARABICA COFFEE.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.937
Lily, thinking:
SEE, BRAD? YOU CAN DO

07:16.970 --> 07:19.773
WHATEVER YOU WANT,
AND SO CAN I.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.108
LIKE I DON'T
KNOW THE CODE.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.877
WHAT HAPPENS IN SPACE CAMP
STAYS IN SPACE CAMP.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.179
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
THINK THEY SHOULD
PAY MORE FOR ARABICA

07:26.213 --> 07:30.718
PROBABLY THINK THAT
COFFEE BEANS ARE
NATURALLY BROWN.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.887
COME HERE, COFFEE BOY!

07:33.921 --> 07:35.989
MMM! HAZELNUT.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.926
DON'T TELL ME THIS STUFF
ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.694
WELL, I HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.597
OH, GOOD. LET'S GO
TELL YOUR DAD.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.866
GOTCHA.

07:46.199 --> 07:50.470
OH, HEY, BABY,
CHECK THIS OUT.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.140
IT'S AN AD
FOR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.743
LOOK AT HOW ADORABLE
THAT BABY IS.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.277
HE'S PEEING BLUE.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.913
THAT'S JUST TO
ILLUSTRATE HOW
ABSORBENT THEY ARE.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.550
I MEAN, THESE DAYS
HAVING A BABY
IS A BREEZE.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.184
IT'S NEVER A BREEZE.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.219
I SAW A WOMAN
AT THE MARKET TODAY

08:06.253 --> 08:07.555
WITH THIS SCREAMING
KID IN HER CART,

08:07.588 --> 08:11.291
AND ALL I COULD THINK
WAS, "THANK GOD WE ARE
DONE WITH THAT STUFF."

08:11.324 --> 08:13.794
THAT KID PROBABLY
WASN'T WEARING THESE
ABSORBENT DIAPERS.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.896
I MEAN, LOOK
AT THIS GUY.
HE'S LAUGHING

08:15.929 --> 08:20.100
AND HE'S PRACTICALLY
SWIMMING IN HIS OWN PEE.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.268
BABY?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.903
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE GETTING
BACK TO SCRANTON,

08:22.936 --> 08:25.706
BUT I'LL DEFINITELY
CALL YOU WHEN I DO.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.274
YEAH, THAT WAS
SOME NIGHT.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.777
YEAH, IT WAS
REALLY SPECIAL.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.079
DID I GIVE YOU
THIS NUMBER?

08:32.112 --> 08:35.716
OH, I GOTTA GO.
GOTTA GO.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.984
WHO WAS THAT?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
IT WAS MY FOOT DOCTOR.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.921
IS YOU FOOT DOCTOR HOT?

08:40.954 --> 08:45.325
THE JUDGES OF THE 1993
MISS SCRANTON
BEAUTY PAGEANT

08:45.358 --> 08:46.359
SEEMED TO THINK SO.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.663
MAN, I NEED THE ROAD.
PLEASE TAKE ME, UNCLE EDDIE.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.199
EVEN IF I COULD,
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR PARENTS WOULD SAY?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.334
FINE. I'LL GO BY MYSELF.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.302
WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

08:55.335 --> 08:57.638
WHEREVER THE ROAD
TAKES ME, MAN.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.239
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO FOR MONEY?

08:59.272 --> 09:01.208
I'M GONNA TURN TRICKS.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.144
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.814
JUGGLING, COIN MAGIC--

09:06.847 --> 09:09.683
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.784
REALLY?
YEAH.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.252
I'M GONNA CALL
LAFF IT UPS.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.923
I'M GONNA GET A SPOT,
AND WE'RE GONNA GO.

09:15.956 --> 09:20.227
YEAH, THIS IS, UH,
EDDIE THE "F."

09:20.260 --> 09:21.995
PUT ME ON THE LIST.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.131
WE'RE GOING TO
SCRANTON.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.334
SWEET! IT'S LIKE A DREAM!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.238
PERMISSION
TO COME ABOARD?

09:31.271 --> 09:34.742
YEAH, PERMISSION
GRANTED, BRAD.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.743
Claudia: HI, BRAD.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.146
MR. FINNERTY,
MRS. FINNERTY. LILY.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.313
HOW YA DOING?

09:40.347 --> 09:43.283
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!
REALLY?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.786
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
EVERY MINUTE.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.287
OH? BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.289
WHEN I ONLY GOT
THE ONE POSTCARD

09:49.322 --> 09:50.924
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.193
WELL, NO, I--I WROTE
A BUNCH OF THEM,

09:53.226 --> 09:55.262
BUT YOU WERE SO MAD AT ME
BEFORE I LEFT

09:55.295 --> 09:57.264
I WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD
SEND THEM OR NOT,

09:57.297 --> 10:00.768
BUT THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.270
WOW! THAT'S A LOT.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.005
I ALSO GOT YOU A HAT
OH!

10:05.038 --> 10:07.340
AND SOME FREEZE DRIED
ICE CREAM.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.877
OH, AND I ALSO GOT YOU--
I GOT YOU THIS.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.346
WOW. IT'S A SHINY CUBE
FROM THE FUTURE.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.383
IT'S A SPACE BLANKET.
IT UNFOLDS.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.951
ONLY ONCE, SO DON'T
EVER OPEN IT.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.354
HEH HEH! SO YOU
REALLY MISSED ME?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.423
YEAH, OF COURSE I DID.

10:23.456 --> 10:28.195
I JUST--I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE
BEFORE I WENT AWAY.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.964
ME, TOO, BRAD.
OK!

10:30.998 --> 10:33.100
HEY, LILY, I GOT YOU
ESPRESSO GRANDE.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.869
WHY, THANK YOU.
HA HA!

10:35.903 --> 10:37.871
WHAT--

10:37.905 --> 10:39.439
WOW. THEY DELIVER NOW.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.276
YEAH. GO TO CAMP,
YOU MISS A LOT.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.044
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.146
BUT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE HIM ANY MONEY.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.816
I PAID HIM BEFORE.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.284
SURE DID.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.021
UGH! SHE IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.190
I KNOW. BABY, DON'T
YOU EVER WISH

10:57.224 --> 10:59.326
WE HAD A SECOND
CHANCE TO HAVE
ANOTHER DAUGHTER

10:59.359 --> 11:01.361
AND MAYBE RAISE HER
RIGHT THIS TIME?

11:01.394 --> 11:04.431
HA! NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.901
AMEN TO THAT.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.871
HEY, BABY.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.906
HEY, I JUST RAN
INTO GARY AND DONNA.
THEY GAVE US THIS

11:12.940 --> 11:15.108
TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR WATCHING
THEIR PLACE.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.243
OH, THAT'S NICE.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.746
YEAH, AND THEY ALSO
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT THIS BACK.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.949
OOH. OH, HEY, I GOT
SOMETHING, TOO.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.416
STAY RIGHT THERE.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.119
THE O'CONNORS WERE
HAVING A YARD SALE,

11:26.153 --> 11:29.189
AND I WENT BY
AND I GOT THIS!

11:29.222 --> 11:30.390
A STROLLER?

11:30.423 --> 11:31.825
WELL, CALL ME
SENTIMENTAL,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.126
BUT I WAS WALKING BY
AND I SAW IT

11:33.160 --> 11:34.494
AND IT JUST REMINDED
ME OF ALL THE TIMES

11:34.527 --> 11:36.964
THAT WE USED TO
PUSH THE LITTLE
ONES AROUND.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.332
OH, LIKE THE TIME WE LOST
JIMMY DOWN THE HILL?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.069
OH, WELL,
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
WITH THIS BAD BOY.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.336
IT'S GOT
BRAKES, SEE?

11:43.370 --> 11:48.341
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT POSSIBLY POSSESSED
YOU TO BUY A STROLLER?

11:49.843 --> 11:53.013
OK. UM--

11:53.046 --> 11:55.282
YOU'RE--

11:55.315 --> 11:58.718
BABY, YOU'RE--

11:59.186 --> 12:02.255
MARRIED
TO A SHOPAHOLIC!

12:03.156 --> 12:05.826
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, HOW'S IT
GOING?

12:05.859 --> 12:06.726
WHERE YOU BEEN?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.962
OH, WE WERE AT THIS
NEW PLACE. COFFETERIA.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.131
REALLY? UM,
IS THERE SOME REASON

12:11.164 --> 12:13.233
YOU CAN'T GO TO YOUR
REGULAR COFFEE PLACE?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.802
NOTHING COMES
TO MIND.

12:14.835 --> 12:18.071
THAT'S WEIRD. LILY,
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED
MOCHA JOJO'S.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.773
YOU HAVE THAT
DISCOUNT CARD AND--

12:19.807 --> 12:20.707
YEAH. IT SEEMS
LIKE ALL SUMMER

12:20.740 --> 12:23.143
YOU'VE BEEN THERE GETTING
YOUR CARD PUNCHED.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.846
NOT ANYMORE.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.215
LILY SAID SHE WANTED TO
TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.783
I'LL BET.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.251
BRAD AND I LIKE TO
TRY NEW THINGS

12:31.284 --> 12:34.054
BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT OLD.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.024
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
EXPENSIVE AND A COUPLE
OF MILES FATHER AWAY,

12:37.057 --> 12:38.458
BUT IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.361
EXACTLY. BRAD,
WHY DON'T YOU
HEAD UPSTAIRS?

12:41.394 --> 12:44.264
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
OK.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.900
LILY, HE'S GONNA
FIND OUT.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.937
YEAH! THE WAY YOU KEEP
GOING ON ABOUT EVERYTHING!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.204
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING HERE?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.239
NOTHING!
LILY THOUGHT BRAD

12:52.272 --> 12:53.306
WAS CHEATING ON HER
AT SPACE CAMP,

12:53.340 --> 12:54.875
SO SHE HAD A LITTLE
REVENGE THING

12:54.908 --> 12:55.909
WITH THE GUY FROM
THE COFFEE SHOP.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.178
WHOA. NOT THE FREAK
WHO HANGS OUT THERE
ALL DAY.

12:58.211 --> 13:02.215
NO, HE WORKS THERE,
AND HE HAS A NAME.
IT'S JOEY.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.285
MOCHA JOEY IS
PUNCHING YOUR CARD?!

13:05.318 --> 13:07.087
NO, NO! AND IT'S OVER.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
AND WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HURTING BRAD NOW?

13:09.156 --> 13:10.357
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HAVE SECRETS
LIKE THAT

13:10.390 --> 13:12.559
IN A RELATIONSHIP,
LIL. IF YOU LOVE
SOMEBODY,

13:12.592 --> 13:14.928
YOU HAVE TO
SHARE EVERYTHING
WITH THEM.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.196
EVEN IF THEY'RE
NOT GONNA LOVE

13:16.229 --> 13:18.966
EVERYTHING THEY
HEAR. RIGHT, SEAN?

13:18.999 --> 13:22.970
WELL, EVERY RELATIONSHIP
IS DIFFERENT, AND THERE
ARE EXCEPTIONS--

13:23.003 --> 13:26.173
WHEN I SAY, "RIGHT,
SEAN?" YOU AGREE.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.141
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.178
FINE. I'LL TELL HIM.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.149
WOW. I AM IN AWE.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.152
I MEAN, THAT WAS SOME
PARENTING RIGHT THERE.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.421
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHEN YOU HAVE PARENTING
MUSCLES LIKE THAT,

13:41.454 --> 13:45.058
YOU WANT TO KEEP
FLEXING THEM. YOU KNOW?

13:45.092 --> 13:46.226
HEY, DAD.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.295
HEY, JIMMY, HOW WAS
SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT UNCLE EDDIE'S?

13:48.328 --> 13:52.132
JIMMY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO GET A SODA
OR SOMETHING?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.068
ALL RIGHT, WHAT
THE HELL HAPPENED?

13:55.102 --> 13:57.537
A LITTLE LIFE
LESSON, OK?

13:58.571 --> 14:01.308
CAN WE STOP? I NEED
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.009
NO TIME.

14:02.042 --> 14:06.146
I--I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.882
HERE'S THE BATHROOM.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.188
I'M FALLING
ASLEEP HERE.

14:15.422 --> 14:19.259
I NEED YOU TO HIT ME
AS HARD AS YOU CAN--

14:21.328 --> 14:25.498
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.037
YOU'RE THE BEST.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.073
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
I'M IN SCRANTON.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.978
HEY, WAKE UP! COME ON,
WE GOTTA GO.

14:38.011 --> 14:42.415
I'M NOT SLEEPING.
I'M FROZEN TO YOUR CAR.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.451
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

14:44.484 --> 14:45.485
HE NEEDED TO
LEARN A LESSON.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.254
EVERYTHING I DID,
I DID FOR HIM.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.257
YOU GOT IT ON
WITH A WAITRESS!

14:50.290 --> 14:51.558
YEAH, THAT PART
WAS FOR ME.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.362
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE
WAS FOR HIM AND YOU.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.332
I CURED YOUR KID'S
LUST FOR THE ROAD.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.401
MMM!

15:03.136 --> 15:05.072
WHAT?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.506
OK, UM, LISTEN,

15:06.539 --> 15:09.409
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I LOVE YOU,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.578
AND I WOULD NEVER, EVER
DO ANYTHING TO--

15:11.611 --> 15:14.414
I CHEATED ON YOU!

15:14.447 --> 15:17.250
WHAT!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.652
I...WAS WEAK.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.820
HEY, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.390
OK, SO NED DUMPED
A BARREL OF TANG
IN THE SWIMMING POOL,

15:23.423 --> 15:26.093
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA
JUMP IN. WANT TO COME?

15:26.126 --> 15:28.561
UH, I WOULDN'T BE
MUCH FUN.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.430
IT'S LILY, ISN'T IT?

15:30.463 --> 15:33.500
I MISS HER SO MUCH.

15:33.533 --> 15:37.337
SHE'S SUCH A LUCKY GIRL,

15:37.370 --> 15:40.340
AND YOU ARE SO SWEET.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.309
AH, THANKS.

15:42.342 --> 15:46.646
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME
SAD TO SEE YOU SO SAD.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.156
LANA, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THIS TO LILY.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.027
WELL, THEN DO IT TO ME.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.229
OH! WHAT--

16:02.262 --> 16:04.164
HEY, THAT'S A GIFT
FROM MY NANA!

16:04.197 --> 16:06.199
I DON'T CARE, BRAD.
I'VE BEEN WAITING

16:06.233 --> 16:07.434
FOR YOU TO MAKE
A MOVE ALL SUMMER,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.369
AND I'M NOT WAITING
ANY LONGER.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.738
I WANT YOU. NOW!

16:11.771 --> 16:14.241
LUNA, STOP
OR I'LL SCREAM!

16:14.274 --> 16:18.278
IT'S SPACE CAMP,
BRAD. NO ONE CAN
HEAR YOU SCREAM.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.448
NOOO!

16:21.481 --> 16:23.616
OK, THAT'S--

16:23.650 --> 16:27.154
OH, MY GOD!
HOW COULD YOU?!

16:27.187 --> 16:30.490
I KNOW, LILY.
I AM SO SORRY.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.592
YOU SLUT!
I KNOW.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.661
I KNOW. I'M--I'M
WORST THAN THAT.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.530
OK? I TOTALLY
DISRESPECTED YOU.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.399
DAMN RIGHT YOU DID.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.401
I MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF PERSON

16:41.434 --> 16:44.771
CHEATS ON
SOMEONE THEY LOVE?

16:44.804 --> 16:48.375
THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.210
YOU WOULD NEVER
CHEAT ON ME.

16:50.243 --> 16:54.347
I MEAN, IF YOU DID,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL I'D DO.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.816
OK, LET'S STOP TALKING
ABOUT CHEATING.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.085
IT'S SUCH A DOWNER.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.154
NO, NO, NO.
LILY, FROM NOW ON,

17:01.188 --> 17:02.489
I'M GONNA
DEDICATE MY LIFE

17:02.522 --> 17:05.492
TO BEING THE BOYFRIEND
YOU DESERVE.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.759
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.262
THE LAST THURSDAY
BEFORE SCHOOL, MY MOM
ALWAYS MAKES HALIBUT.

17:09.296 --> 17:13.433
BUT AFTER DINNER,
I'M GONNA START TO
TRY TO DESERVE YOU.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.339
HEY, BRAD, YOU OK?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.475
NOT REALLY. UH...

17:22.509 --> 17:25.145
SOMETHING KIND OF
HAPPENED WHEN ME
AND LILY WERE APART,

17:25.178 --> 17:28.115
AND I--I JUST
FEEL HORRIBLE.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.216
DON'T--DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

17:29.249 --> 17:33.486
YOU KNOW LILY.
YOU KNOW HOW SHE
OVERREACTS, YOU KNOW.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.822
YOU WENT TO CAMP,
OK, SHE GOT ALL MAD,

17:35.855 --> 17:38.491
SHE CHEATED ON YOU.
THESE THINGS PASS.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.529
S

17:42.562 --> 17:46.499
YEAH. ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE
TALKING ABOUT IN THERE?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.368
NO!

17:48.401 --> 17:50.570
OH. HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.174
JUST STAY RIGHT THERE
FOR A SECOND, OK?

17:54.207 --> 17:55.242
UH, HEY, LILY,

17:55.275 --> 17:58.245
I MAY HAVE
HINTED TO BRAD THAT
YOU CHEATED ON HIM.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.479
OK? SEE YOU LATER.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.713
WHAT?!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.182
YOU CHEATED
ON ME?!

18:02.215 --> 18:02.915
SORRY, BRAD!

18:02.949 --> 18:04.451
WELL, WEREN'T YOU
GONNA TELL ME?

18:04.484 --> 18:07.354
YES! I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.122
WELL, HOW ABOUT WHEN
I WAS CONFESSING
TO CHEATING?

18:09.156 --> 18:11.191
DID THAT MAYBE SEEM
LIKE THE RIGHT TIME?

18:11.224 --> 18:14.461
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
PILING ON.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.463
SO YOU JUST LET ME
DANGLE THERE?

18:16.496 --> 18:19.266
I DIDN'T WANT TO
MAKE YOU MORE UPSET.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.334
WHO WAS IT?

18:21.368 --> 18:23.470
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW HIM.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.572
JOSEPH DeSTEFANO.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.340
AW, MOCHA JOEY?!

18:27.374 --> 18:30.610
THAT FREAK WHO LIVES
AT THE COFFEE SHOP?

18:30.643 --> 18:33.480
HE WORKS THERE!

18:33.513 --> 18:35.348
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.917
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.353
WELL, HOW FAR
DID YOU GO?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.455
WELL, HOW FAR DID YOU
GO WITH LUNA?

18:42.489 --> 18:45.158
NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S DIFFERENT,
OK. I CONFESSED.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.360
YOU--YOU TRIED
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.496
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW IF I CAN
EVER TRUST YOU AGAIN.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.532
WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO TRUST YOU?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.533
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN'T.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.235
WELL, MAYBE WE'RE TROUGH!

18:55.268 --> 18:56.369
THAT'S FINE WITH ME!

18:56.403 --> 18:57.537
FINE WITH ME, TOO!

18:57.570 --> 19:00.840
THANKS FOR RUINING
COFFEE FOR ME!

19:00.873 --> 19:05.712
THANKS FOR RUINING
SPACE FOR ME!

19:09.382 --> 19:11.351
HEY, EDDIE, CAN YOU
GIVE ME A BEER?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.485
NO.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.554
EDDIE, JUST GIVE ME
A BEER.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.624
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.226
WHAT?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.329
YOUR DOCTOR TOLD SEAN.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.565
STAY HERE. I'LL BE
BACK IN A MINUTE.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.736
HEY, SEAN, UM,

19:29.769 --> 19:32.405
I THINK CLAUDIA
FOUND OUT THAT
SHE'S PREGNANT,

19:32.439 --> 19:35.642
SO I'M GONNA GO,
ALL RIGHT?
HAVE A BREW.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.446
WERE YOU PLANNING
ON TELLING ME?

19:39.479 --> 19:42.515
BABY, I WAS--I WAS
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.617
WHEN'S THE RIGHT TIME,
WHEN I'M CROWING?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.719
WELL, I JUST FIGURED
YOU WANTED TO
FINISH SCHOOL

19:46.753 --> 19:49.289
AND START YOUR CAREER--
I DO, I DO.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.458
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DONE WITH ALL THIS.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.293
WE NEVER PLANNED ON
HAVING ANOTHER ONE.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.328
I KNOW.
BUT WE NEVER
PLANNED

19:55.362 --> 19:56.629
ON HAVING
THE OTHERS, EITHER.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.764
THAT'S TRUE, YEAH.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.466
BUT AM I READY
FOR ALL THIS AGAIN?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.534
I MEAN THE DIAPERS
I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.969
AND THE FEEDING
AND THE BABY--

20:03.002 --> 20:05.738
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I KNOW HOW TO DO IT

20:05.772 --> 20:08.675
SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE
EASIER, YOU KNOW?

20:08.708 --> 20:09.842
BECAUSE
AT LEAST I KNOW.
RIGHT.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.545
BUT DO YOU EVER
REALLY KNOW,
YOU KNOW?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.981
BUT MAYBE
THAT'S PART OF
THE GOOD THING

20:15.014 --> 20:17.984
ABOUT HAVING
A LITTLE BABY.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.388
SO WHERE'D WE LAND?

20:21.421 --> 20:22.822
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

20:22.855 --> 20:26.459
OH, YES! AND WE ALREADY
HAVE A STROLLER!

20:26.493 --> 20:30.330
HA! GOD, WHEN COULD
THIS HAVE HAPPENED,
THOUGH?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.063
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.465
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
SO CAREFUL.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.767
HMM.
YOU KNOW, EXCEPT,
WELL, THE HOT TUB,

20:34.801 --> 20:37.670
BUT YOU SAID
WE COULDN'T--

20:37.704 --> 20:39.739
GET PREGNANT
IN THE HOT TUB.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.274
YOU'RE A TOTAL ASS.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.643
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE ME

20:43.676 --> 20:46.813
IN TIMES OF
HEIGHTENED EXCITEMENT.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.816
I AM NAMING
THIS BABY ASS, JR.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.618
I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.586
HEH HEH HEH! OH!
