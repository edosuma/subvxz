13:47.870 --> 13:51.165
With the gentle touch
of her hand.

13:51.290 --> 13:55.169
It contains the mysteries
of the Universe.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.796
My Tiles can tell me anything.

13:57.921 --> 14:01.467
About anyone. Anywhere.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.718
And everyone's got a question

14:02.843 --> 14:04.762
they're dying to know
the answer to.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.388
What fate has in store
for them.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.392
I reach in,
and just like that,

14:10.517 --> 14:15.272
I've got the answer
in the palm of my hand.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.190
May l?

14:16.315 --> 14:19.401
[lnhales sharply]
That's my other rule, Jon.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.029
You can look,
but you can't touch.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.198
Is that your rule

14:24.323 --> 14:26.909
or your boyfriend's?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.495
My girlfriend's.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.122
Oh, so that's what
brought you in here.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.374
Girl trouble.

14:33.499 --> 14:37.711
Let rne guess, she doesn't like
you using your gift.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.296
We're hard to love.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.216
People fall for us
because of our abilities,

14:42.341 --> 14:45.344
but they always come to fear the
very thing that drew them in.

14:45.469 --> 14:50.557
They tell us to tone it down,
betray our gifts.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.520
Like declawing a cat.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.482
It's cruel.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.194
And here I thought
I was sitting with a gentleman.

15:02.319 --> 15:06.657
But I've shown you my Tiles and
you haven't returned the favor.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.118
[sighs]

15:21.088 --> 15:24.216
It's kind of adorable.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.846
You were wrong.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.264
Before.

15:30.389 --> 15:33.934
Fate controls most of
the outcomes in the world,

15:34.059 --> 15:36.520
but not all of them.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.606
/ control the rest.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.114
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

15:47.239 --> 15:49.741
I'm decent, Linda.
It's alright.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.205
{sighs}
- Hey.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.090
Reminds me of old times, huh?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.050
Getting stitched up in here.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.639
-[Clears throat]
-[Chuckles]

16:12.764 --> 16:15.642
- Here.
- Thanks.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.603
Doc says Vic can go home now.

16:17.728 --> 16:18.979
[lnhales shakily]

16:19.104 --> 16:21.398
I'm -- I'm worried
she's having

16:21.523 --> 16:23.108
one of her
mental breakdowns, Chris.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.361
She thinks she can find Wayne
with her motorcycle.

16:26.487 --> 16:30.282
[Chuckles lightly]

16:30.407 --> 16:32.409
I think she can.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.954
Jesus Christ.
Chris. . . [Scoffs]

16:37.956 --> 16:41.335
Linda, I saw it
with my own eyes.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.045
What did you see?

16:49.218 --> 16:51.386
What did you see, Chris?

16:51.512 --> 16:53.222
I saw, urn...

16:55.807 --> 16:58.769
...a walking dead man

16:58.894 --> 17:01.897
take our grandson

17:02.022 --> 17:05.817
in [exhales sharply]
this impossible car.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.736
[Chuckles]

17:07.861 --> 17:10.155
And Vic almost stopped him.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.781
- Mm-hmm. ..
- You know?

17:17.579 --> 17:19.330
I know that it's...

17:21.458 --> 17:23.001
...sounds crazy.
I know that.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.587
- But. ..
- LINDA: [Chuckles, snorts]

17:25.712 --> 17:27.798
Linda, she's special.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.511
W-Well, there's special, Chris,

17:32.636 --> 17:34.763
and then there's magic.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.558
Our daughter's not magic.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.017
How do you know?

17:39.142 --> 17:40.519
How do I know?
'Cause. . . [scoffs]

17:40.644 --> 17:42.646
I wiped her snotty nose,
for Chrissake.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.523
What kind of mother

17:44.648 --> 17:47.442
misses something like that?

17:47.568 --> 17:50.028
The kind that's too busy
hiding her bruises

17:50.153 --> 17:53.282
and paying the bills
to look up.

17:53.407 --> 17:56.910
The kind with a philandering
drunk for a husband.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.797
Let's...

18:08.922 --> 18:12.467
Let's listen to her.

18:12.593 --> 18:13.719
Believe her.

18:21.476 --> 18:25.022
[sighs]

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
[Siren wailing in distance]

18:33.989 --> 18:36.158
[Groans]

18:36.283 --> 18:37.868
Lou.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.787
- Ohh...
- Lou, it's okay.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.789
Hey.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.710
It's okay.
The doctor said you, uh...

18:46.835 --> 18:48.253
[Sniffles]

18:48.378 --> 18:49.963
You had a cardiac event
at the lake.

18:50.088 --> 18:53.216
They -- They put a stent
in your heart.

18:57.512 --> 19:00.599
[Voice breaking]
Your heart, Lou.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.565
Mm. . .W-Wayne.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.275
Where's Wayne?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.862
Look, the cardiologist said you
just need to take it easy, okay?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.281
[Breathing heavily]
You have to tell me, Vic.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.616
I need to know.

19:22.245 --> 19:26.041
The FBI lost his phone signal.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.043
Mnh, no.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.294
No --

19:29.419 --> 19:31.129
Lou, hey. Come on.

19:31.254 --> 19:35.133
[Groaniflg]

19:35.258 --> 19:38.136
How much time do we have?

19:38.261 --> 19:41.348
I don't know. I -- I...

19:41.473 --> 19:43.558
I got to get the Triumph back,
I got to get it running...

19:43.684 --> 19:45.977
Hey. .-

19:46.103 --> 19:48.146
<i>We.</i>

19:48.271 --> 19:50.565
<i>We've</i> got to get it running.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.203
We're in this together.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.123
Han and Leia.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.500
I don't think
that Han and Leia

20:08.625 --> 20:11.670
had a heart stent
and a bad spleen. [Sniffs]

20:11.795 --> 20:13.547
Yeah, well...
the Millennium Falcon

20:13.672 --> 20:16.174
ain't got nothin'
on the Triumph.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.176
[Laughing] Did the
Millennium Falcon ever get

20:18.301 --> 20:20.679
[sniffles]
T-boned by an SUV?

20:20.804 --> 20:21.555
No.

20:21.680 --> 20:27.185
But Han Solo ain't half the
mechanic as Lou Carmody.

20:27.310 --> 20:31.732
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

20:31.857 --> 20:33.734
[Sniffs]

20:33.859 --> 20:35.777
And rate yourself...

20:35.902 --> 20:37.571
above Han Solo?

20:37.696 --> 20:40.282
Yeah. Yeah.

20:41.450 --> 20:45.787
- No?
-[Chuckles, sniffles]

20:45.912 --> 20:47.706
[Laughs]

20:47.831 --> 20:50.667
Alright, Han.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.754
Let's get you up,
get you dressed.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.881
Okay.
[lnhales sharply]

20:56.006 --> 20:57.215
- Ready?
- Yeah.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.302
- One, two, three.
-[Groans]

21:06.433 --> 21:10.145
I guess you didn't come in here
looking for a drink.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.980
I'm sober.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.484
I didn't know what I was looking
for when I walked into this bar.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.777
Or who.

21:16.902 --> 21:20.989
Someone with whom you can be
your whole self.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.533
Someone who's not afraid
of your power.

21:23.658 --> 21:26.870
Someone who's not afraid
to show rne theirs.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.961
[Sucks teeth] Excuse rne.

21:35.086 --> 21:39.216
May I have a moment
of your time?

21:40.926 --> 21:42.469
Sure.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.095
What can I get for you?

21:44.221 --> 21:47.557
A bottle of the finest bourbon
you have in the house,

21:47.682 --> 21:49.100
and make it on the house.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.564
[Static crackling]

22:02.113 --> 22:03.156
BARTENDER: On the house, sir.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.579
[Static crackling]

22:12.874 --> 22:15.961
[Gasps] That's impressive.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.671
JON: Exhilarating at first,

22:17.796 --> 22:20.465
boring by the end.
[Sniffs]

22:20.590 --> 22:22.801
And it doesn't come
on the house.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.805
It affects your hearing?

22:26.930 --> 22:30.100
My memory. [Sighs]

22:30.225 --> 22:32.477
First twenty years of my life
are a blur.

22:32.602 --> 22:35.689
Your turn.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.774
[Chuckles]
Think it'd kill the mood.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.985
Tonic-clonic seizures.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.779
I wouldn't worry about that.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.489
I can take care of you.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.657
Oh yeah?

22:45.782 --> 22:47.951
JON: I've learned to mitigate
the cost of my Hourglass.

22:48.076 --> 22:52.831
The last twenty years
are clear as a bell.

22:52.956 --> 22:56.251
I can teach you.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.962
What'll it cost me?

22:59.087 --> 23:02.924
The answer to my question.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.676
The one everyone has.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.595
Everyone thinks
they want answers

23:06.720 --> 23:08.346
until they get one
they don't like.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.933
Fate brought us together,
right?

23:12.058 --> 23:15.645
Well, maybe it was so I could
help you outrun yours.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.362
Upstairs.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.164
[Flame hissing]

23:34.289 --> 23:38.084
[Lighter snaps shut]

23:38.209 --> 23:42.130
There are two ways to mitigate
the cost of your gift.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.049
Sit.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.349
Option A--

23:52.474 --> 23:54.017
Hurt yourself.

23:56.895 --> 23:57.812
Option B --

23:57.938 --> 23:59.564
Hurt someone else.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.483
Which do you think
Hlchoose?

24:01.608 --> 24:03.568
I'm guessing the former.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.321
Mm, masochist to the core.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.698
Sobriety's a dead giveaway.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.493
I've explored both options.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.286
Noted.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.413
You'll need your Tiles.

24:15.538 --> 24:20.085
This is a hands-on tutorial.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.545
Trust me.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.923
I'm not gonna hurt you

24:25.048 --> 24:26.633
unless you want me to.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.891
Tiles need a question.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.602
So tell me, Jon, what is it
you're dying to know?

24:44.442 --> 24:46.736
You might not like the answer.

24:46.861 --> 24:50.073
I'm prepared for
whatever fate hands rne.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.992
Are you ready?

24:54.494 --> 24:56.287
Give me your arm.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.561
-[Sizzling]
-[Gasp$]

25:19.686 --> 25:24.024
Ah...don't scream.

25:24.149 --> 25:26.151
Just harness the pain.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.611
-[Whimpers]
- Yeah, yeah.

25:28.737 --> 25:30.739
And when it fills you up

25:30.864 --> 25:33.700
till it's all you know...

25:33.825 --> 25:35.994
-[Whimpers]
- JON: ...use your gift.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.538
MAGGIE: [Breathing heavily]

25:42.876 --> 25:44.919
Will Jon achieve immortality?

25:45.045 --> 25:48.173
[Tiles rattling]

25:58.475 --> 26:00.101
Holy shit, it worked.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.729
What's the answer?

26:06.024 --> 26:07.650
Fate can be cruel, Jon.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.699
[Chuckles]

26:14.824 --> 26:15.992
[Yells]
[Glass shatters]

26:50.401 --> 26:52.153
VIC: Ma...

26:52.278 --> 26:56.116
Uh, Dad and Lou went
to pick up my motorcycle.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.493
We, just, uh...

26:58.618 --> 27:00.537
We just need someplace dry
to work on it.

27:00.662 --> 27:04.791
It's too busy over at the lake.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.918
I always thought you spent
too much time drawing,

27:07.043 --> 27:11.506
'cause how could pictures ever
help you in this world?

27:11.631 --> 27:13.967
But truth is, I didn't
understand it, Vicki.

27:14.092 --> 27:16.719
I didn't understand you.

27:16.845 --> 27:19.722
I was a weird kid, Ma.

27:19.848 --> 27:22.058
You were always so quiet.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.518
So self-sufficient.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.980
Never wanted to play with dolls
or have a tea party, remember?

27:27.105 --> 27:30.233
Wouldn't let me set your hair.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.653
Inevenu
[Breathes deeply]

27:33.778 --> 27:36.197
I never felt you needed rne.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.704
I did.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.377
[Chuckling] I do.

27:57.802 --> 28:00.597
Tell me how it works.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.975
Your gift.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.935
[Chuckles lightly]

28:10.690 --> 28:14.110
I don't fully understand it
myself.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.538
Tell your father he can fix
the bike in the kitchen.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.128
- Thanks, Ma.
- Mm-hmm.

28:44.349 --> 28:47.644
[sighs]

28:55.652 --> 28:57.278
Where are you going?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.155
Nowhere.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.492
I just figured you could
probably use another drink.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.292
[sighs]

29:21.636 --> 29:25.223
I'm sorry
I scared you before.

29:25.348 --> 29:30.103
See, when I ask for a moment
of someone's time,

29:30.228 --> 29:32.522
I keep my memory

29:32.647 --> 29:34.774
by taking their life.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.985
[sighs]

29:37.110 --> 29:42.240
I thought maybe there was a way
I could also bank their time.

29:45.243 --> 29:47.495
Immortality, she's elusive.

29:47.620 --> 29:52.333
Have you ever heard of a man
called Charlie Manx?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.794
He's unlocked the secret.

And if he can...

29:58.840 --> 30:03.845
I told you you wouldn't like
the answer.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.931
But you can't change fate.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.516
Why don't we go downstairs?

30:08.641 --> 30:10.184
The Tiles have to be wrong.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.437
The Tiles never lie...

30:12.562 --> 30:14.188
Ask them again.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.357
You'll get the same answer.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.608
JON: Fine.

30:17.734 --> 30:21.112
I'll make you ask them.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.856
You came here with a purpose.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.358
You came here for me.

30:58.483 --> 31:01.402
You tried to kill Vic McQueen.

31:01.527 --> 31:05.073
Are you saying she's alive?

31:05.198 --> 31:07.950
You're nothing but a failed
errand boy for Charlie Manx.

-[Gasping]

31:09.952 --> 31:14.665
You see, typically,
my victims do themselves in.

31:14.791 --> 31:20.755
It's rare I get
such a hands-on opportunity.

I'm gonna fix it.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.167
Here, I can, uh...

32:39.292 --> 32:42.545
I'll run to the bike shop
if we need, alright, Brat?

32:56.476 --> 32:58.436

- I can...
- Yeah, yeah.

Baby, I'm the best mechanic
west of the Rocky Mountains.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.868
- I can fix this bike.
- We're losing him.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.245
No. No.

33:16.370 --> 33:19.832
You'll find him. Okay?

33:19.957 --> 33:24.128
You'll find him.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.340
Do you remember that --
that kid in the Wraith?

33:27.465 --> 33:30.134
Back at Sam's?

33:30.259 --> 33:32.762
Brad McCauley.

33:32.887 --> 33:37.058
What if, by the time I find him,
he's not the same?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.936
No. No.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.646
Our son is strong.

33:41.771 --> 33:44.815
And he's a fighter.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.567
He's fighting right now.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.653
Okay?

33:48.778 --> 33:50.905
C'mon, let's go get
your dad's tools.

It's a long journey, Wayne.

-[Weakly] I don't feel good.
- CHARLIE: Mm.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.621
It does appear you need
a little extra rest.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.838
I'll ensure we're safe.

34:48.963 --> 34:51.841
Then we can have a sleep
and dream of Christmasland

34:51.966 --> 34:53.509
in this special car,

34:53.634 --> 34:57.096
and then
when the sun rises again,

34:57.221 --> 34:59.640
it'll be like
Christmas morning.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.102
You'll see.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.772
Go back to sleep, Wayne McQueen.

I'm gonna call you Sunny.

Hey, Sunny.

36:29.397 --> 36:33.401
Alright, till this evening.

36:33.526 --> 36:34.902
Agent Hutter.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.154
I prepared a statement.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.989
I've been briefed.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.533
You broke protocol.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.118
Ibeheved
I was gonna lose the perp

36:42.243 --> 36:43.828
if I didn't move quickly.

36:43.953 --> 36:47.206
Well, you lost him, regardless.

36:47.331 --> 36:51.127
And put yourself at risk
in the process.

36:55.172 --> 37:00.010
I understand the victim's
mother, Victoria McQueen,

37:00.136 --> 37:02.722
is a friend of, uh...

37:02.847 --> 37:04.640
a friend of your girlfriend's.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.434
Yeah, I can assure you
that had no bearing

37:06.559 --> 37:07.601
on my decision-making.

37:07.727 --> 37:10.271
History of
mental health issues,

37:10.396 --> 37:11.522

37:11.647 --> 37:13.858
Set fire to her house
in Colorado --

37:13.983 --> 37:15.276
with her son inside.

37:15.401 --> 37:19.155
She suffered a lot of trauma
at the hands of Charlie Manx.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.282
Agent Chen shot himself
in the head.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.868
Agent Ash was shot

37:23.993 --> 37:26.620
with a gun belonging to
Christopher McQueen.

37:26.746 --> 37:28.497
That had nothing to do with Vic.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.292
This girl, she's unstable.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.960
Traumatized,
as you yourself said.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.837
So she hears the news
that Charlie Manx is dead.

37:34.962 --> 37:39.967
Maybe she has a little PTSD,
maybe she has a psychotic break.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.553
Usually with missing children,
it's one of the parents.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.514
That's not the case here.

37:45.639 --> 37:49.185
Vic would never hurt her son.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.605
You know, we've all gotten
too close to a case.

how to pull up for air,

37:55.024 --> 37:57.735
some of us have to learn
the hard way.

37:57.860 --> 38:00.863
Unfortunately, Agent Hutter,
at this juncture,

38:00.988 --> 38:03.741
I don't think you're physically
or emotionally equipped

38:03.866 --> 38:05.409
to see this one through.

better than anyone.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.126
I can solve this case.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.669
Once you've made
a full recovery,

38:15.795 --> 38:17.630
I'll consider assigning you
to another case.

38:17.755 --> 38:21.050
But for now, don't make this
any harder on yourself

38:21.175 --> 38:22.343
than it needs to be.

for a Knife.

we'll catch Bing.

- Yeah. [Sniffles]

my seizures.

with a cigarette?

40:15.497 --> 40:16.707
That's not normal.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.334
I'm not normal.

40:18.459 --> 40:19.752
Okay, l'm sorry, but you --

40:19.877 --> 40:22.922
you risk your life every day
with the FBI.

40:23.047 --> 40:25.007
And I would never ask you
to quit your job,

40:25.132 --> 40:28.260
because I know that's
a huge part of who you are.

burn yourself.

B-Because I love you.

like something was missing.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.190
This...

40:41.315 --> 40:44.234
This is a small price to pay.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.862
So, can you pl--

Can you please just accept me?
