WEBVTT

00:03.464 --> 00:04.924
(eerie music)
(thunder rumbling)

00:05.008 --> 00:10.179
(rain hammering)
(wind howling)

00:12.974 --> 00:16.227
- He terrorized the people
of these mountains for years,

00:16.309 --> 00:19.063
stealing the cattle,
killing the men folk,

00:19.147 --> 00:21.858
kidnapping children from
their beds where they lay.

00:23.234 --> 00:27.196
He was a beast, without a scrap
of human feeling or decency.

00:28.364 --> 00:30.241
So, he had to die.

00:30.324 --> 00:31.325
- I don't like this.

00:32.744 --> 00:33.536
- Go on, Golly.

00:34.871 --> 00:37.623
- It was the turn
of the year, 1304.

00:37.707 --> 00:38.750
He'd been lured here,

00:38.833 --> 00:41.085
by the promise of
MacDonald hospitality.

00:41.169 --> 00:43.963
His men were plied with
drink, which had been drugged,

00:44.047 --> 00:47.258
so they just fell
down senseless.

00:47.342 --> 00:48.926
And at the stroke of midnight,

00:50.386 --> 00:52.472
the simple company turned
on the abandoned chief,

00:53.890 --> 00:55.475
and stabbed them,

00:55.558 --> 00:59.020
so that no one man would
be held responsible.

00:59.103 --> 01:01.689
Legend has it that he
was cut by 50 swords.

01:01.773 --> 01:02.648
- Ah, mm.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.570
- Fantastic!

01:07.653 --> 01:10.198
- And that was the end
of Mad Malcolm MacGregor.

01:10.281 --> 01:11.324
- Thank goodness for that.

01:11.407 --> 01:12.241
- And was it?

01:13.868 --> 01:17.246
With his dying breath, he
cursed the family MacDonald,

01:17.329 --> 01:20.041
and swore to haunt their
house by the water forever,

01:21.668 --> 01:23.169
especially at Hogmanay.

01:23.252 --> 01:24.253
- Right now in fact.

01:24.337 --> 01:25.963
(thunder rumbling)

01:26.047 --> 01:28.841
(cheerful music)

02:02.542 --> 02:04.794
(owl hooting)
(rain hammering)

02:04.877 --> 02:06.254
- [Ian] Over the
rickety, rackety bridge.

02:06.337 --> 02:08.965
(eerie music)

02:10.174 --> 02:12.051
See that, Beckie?
- Yes.

02:13.928 --> 02:15.138
Dad, it's an owl.

02:15.221 --> 02:16.681
- [Ian] Some people
might say it's an omen.

02:16.764 --> 02:18.808
- Some people might
be off their trolleys.

02:18.890 --> 02:21.853
- Look, Beckie, I know you
didn't want to come with me,

02:21.936 --> 02:25.398
but now that we're here, let's
try and enjoy ourselves, eh?

02:25.481 --> 02:27.483
Have a happy New Year?

02:27.567 --> 02:28.443
- Okay, Dad.

02:28.526 --> 02:30.111
- I can't wait.

02:30.194 --> 02:33.448
I've waited all year
to see Mad Malcolm.

02:33.531 --> 02:35.158
(owl squawking)

02:35.241 --> 02:37.702
(tense music)

02:55.845 --> 02:59.766
(leg thuds)
- Ooh, ow!

02:59.849 --> 03:02.769
(thunder rumbling)

03:05.188 --> 03:06.105
- [Both] Hi.

03:06.189 --> 03:07.315
- Settled into your new room?

03:07.398 --> 03:08.816
- Yes, it's a lot warmer.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.526
I left a message
for the plumber.

03:12.153 --> 03:14.030
I'm sorry Archie won't be
here for the New Year party.

03:14.113 --> 03:15.490
- Yeah, it's a shame, isn't it?

03:15.573 --> 03:16.991
- When will he be back?

03:17.075 --> 03:19.744
- I'm not sure.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.412
Look, we'd better go and eat.

03:21.496 --> 03:22.413
Visitors will be arriving soon.

03:22.496 --> 03:23.748
- Yeah, right.

03:23.831 --> 03:25.249
I'll, well, just
go and get ready.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.125
- Okay.

03:27.627 --> 03:28.878
- I was so looking
forward to having him back

03:28.961 --> 03:29.962
where he belongs.

03:30.046 --> 03:31.756
- Oh, nevermind, Molly,

03:31.839 --> 03:33.299
we'll still make it
the bash of the year.

03:33.383 --> 03:35.968
- It just won't be
the same without him.

03:36.051 --> 03:37.637
Who's going to first foot?

03:37.720 --> 03:39.764
That's Archie's job.

03:39.847 --> 03:42.225
And the black bun
he always cooks.

03:42.307 --> 03:43.976
You will have to make
it instead, Ewan.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.561
- Okay, Molly, it'll
be a piece of cake.

03:45.645 --> 03:46.813
(intercom buzzes)
- Can you get that for me,

03:46.896 --> 03:47.772
Duncan, please?

03:47.855 --> 03:48.648
- Yeah.

03:52.235 --> 03:54.696
- These ghost hunters, we
could have some fun with them.

03:54.779 --> 03:55.862
- Aye?

03:55.947 --> 03:57.615
- They want ghosts, right?

03:57.699 --> 03:58.908
We give them ghosts.

04:01.119 --> 04:03.329
- No, that wouldn't be right.

04:03.413 --> 04:05.123
- You're not scared
are you, Dunc?

04:11.004 --> 04:11.754
- Hello?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.507
- [Ian] Hello!

04:14.590 --> 04:16.926
- [Duncan] Would that be our
unfortunate visitorses, yes?

04:18.094 --> 04:19.595
- That's right.

04:19.678 --> 04:22.724
- I cannot speaks for
long, but you must go back!

04:23.808 --> 04:25.226
Once you cross that bridge,

04:26.144 --> 04:29.647
nothing will ever be as it was!

04:29.731 --> 04:30.982
(Beckie laughs)

04:31.065 --> 04:32.483
- I'm sorry?

04:32.567 --> 04:35.361
- I would not wish you to
suffer like the otherses!

04:35.445 --> 04:36.821
Go back, or not all of us,

04:36.904 --> 04:38.698
(hand slapping)
Och, no, no!

04:38.781 --> 04:41.367
(Beckie laughs)

04:41.451 --> 04:43.036
- [Ian] Is that
someone fooling about?

04:43.119 --> 04:46.789
- Hello, sorry, yeah, that
was just one of the children.

04:46.873 --> 04:47.915
(Ewan laughing)

04:47.999 --> 04:49.542
You've actually
come the back way,

04:49.625 --> 04:52.503
so if you punch six, six,
six, into the key pad,

04:52.587 --> 04:53.880
and then the barrier will open.

04:53.963 --> 04:56.758
Now, the house is
five miles further on.

04:56.841 --> 04:57.925
Okay, see you soon.

05:00.303 --> 05:03.264
- Six, six, six, interesting.
(buttons beeping)

05:03.348 --> 05:06.434
(barrier squeaking)

05:07.769 --> 05:09.729
- I just wonder why you
invited him, that's all.

05:09.812 --> 05:12.398
- I thought his website
would be good publicity,

05:12.482 --> 05:13.691
attract more visitors.

05:14.942 --> 05:15.777
- Mad Malcolm?

05:15.860 --> 05:17.153
It's all tosh, Lexie.

05:17.236 --> 05:18.237
- [Lexie] Maybe.

05:18.321 --> 05:20.531
- And then again, maybe not.

05:20.615 --> 05:23.326
- And Scotland's
Scariest Spirits,

05:23.409 --> 05:25.661
got 60,000 hits
in its first week.

05:25.745 --> 05:27.997
- Well, is that the sort of
business we wanna attract?

05:28.081 --> 05:30.416
I thought we're supposed to be
innovative, forward looking?

05:30.500 --> 05:32.585
- Archie always said
you should raise income

05:32.669 --> 05:33.961
wherever you can find it.

05:34.045 --> 05:35.630
- [Paul] But Archie's
not here, Molly.

05:35.713 --> 05:37.006
- Well, he will be soon,

05:37.090 --> 05:38.132
and for a long time
to come, eh, Lexie?

05:38.216 --> 05:39.425
- Mm.

05:39.509 --> 05:41.552
- What are you gonna
wear to the party, Paul?

05:41.636 --> 05:43.012
How about a kilt?

05:43.096 --> 05:45.181
Let's get a squint
of those legs.

05:45.264 --> 05:47.100
- (chuckles) Don't
think so, not really me.

05:47.183 --> 05:48.935
- I don't see why not.

05:49.018 --> 05:50.436
Your father was a
Highland chieftain,

05:50.520 --> 05:52.021
who observed all the traditions,

05:52.105 --> 05:54.482
that you appear to have
very little time for.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.902
(eerie music)

05:57.985 --> 06:00.530
- [Ian] Would you look at that!

06:02.073 --> 06:04.867
- [Beckie] Welcome
to the house of fun.

06:04.951 --> 06:07.745
(doors creaking)

06:15.336 --> 06:17.463
- And this our chef, Ewan.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.090
- Chef, housekeeper,

06:19.173 --> 06:22.051
ready to serve your needs
and guarantee your pleasure.

06:22.135 --> 06:25.138
As the man said, "Let
me entertain you."

06:25.221 --> 06:27.557
- Robbie Williams,
can't stand him.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.391
(woman laughing)
- Let me show you

06:28.474 --> 06:29.392
to your room.

06:30.977 --> 06:32.645
- I don't know how
you do it, son.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.940
- [Golly] This way, lass.

06:36.024 --> 06:39.444
- Ah, it's okay, I
like a challenge.

06:42.822 --> 06:45.199
- Have you seen Mad
Malcolm, Mrs. MacDonald?

06:45.283 --> 06:48.536
- No, but my husband did
on several occasions,

06:48.619 --> 06:51.914
especially late in the
evening, after a good dinner.

06:51.998 --> 06:54.542
They're now in a position to
forge a closer friendship,

06:54.625 --> 06:56.919
Hector died 23 months ago.

06:57.003 --> 06:58.379
- I'm sorry.

06:58.463 --> 07:01.716
And has your husband ever
appeared to you in any way?

07:01.799 --> 07:04.552
- Oh yes, we get messages
from him all the time.

07:04.635 --> 07:05.595
- Really?

07:05.678 --> 07:07.472
- Unpaid wine merchants' bills,

07:07.555 --> 07:10.516
golf balls secreted in
the most bizarre places.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.809
- What about your son?

07:11.893 --> 07:13.936
Has he seen the spirit?

07:14.020 --> 07:15.396
- My son?

07:15.480 --> 07:16.356
- The young man we met.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.900
- Oh, Paul is not my son.

07:18.983 --> 07:20.693
- He is one of the
family, though?

07:21.778 --> 07:22.904
- Well, not really,

07:22.987 --> 07:24.364
I suppose, in a way,

07:24.447 --> 07:25.782
yes, sort of.

07:28.618 --> 07:29.494
- Excuse me.

07:35.958 --> 07:36.793
- This way, lass.

07:39.462 --> 07:42.006
- There's a definite
chill the air, just here.

07:43.925 --> 07:45.134
Most suggestive.

07:47.303 --> 07:49.722
- I take it you don't share
your father's beliefs then?

07:49.806 --> 07:52.767
- No, I've never seen
a ghost, never will.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.102
- There you go.

07:56.020 --> 07:56.896
(Beckie screams)

07:56.979 --> 08:02.025
- [Duncan] Ah, ah! (grunts)

08:02.819 --> 08:02.985
- Get up, lad.

08:08.616 --> 08:09.492
- Hello.

08:09.575 --> 08:10.284
- [Golly] This is-

08:10.367 --> 08:12.120
- One of the children.

08:12.203 --> 08:15.081
- [Golly] Duncan, Beckie Body.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.041
- Pardon?

08:17.125 --> 08:17.875
- Body.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.043
(Duncan laughs)

08:19.127 --> 08:21.713
- I mean, what a great name.

08:22.922 --> 08:24.757
- You're in here, sir.

08:24.841 --> 08:27.635
- I was just making your bed.

08:27.719 --> 08:31.305
I hope you're in it,
comfortable in it.

08:31.389 --> 08:33.640
- Shall I give you a hand?

08:38.938 --> 08:39.938
With the bed?

08:42.025 --> 08:42.817
- Right.

08:46.154 --> 08:49.157
(Ewan's throat clearing)

08:49.240 --> 08:50.825
- They're my dad's.

08:53.995 --> 08:56.748
(Beckie giggles)

08:59.584 --> 09:00.668
- No, Archie.

09:01.836 --> 09:03.004
(gentle music)

09:03.087 --> 09:04.589
Look, it's just getting
harder and harder

09:04.672 --> 09:06.007
to keep a lid on things.

09:08.134 --> 09:13.306
No, Paul hasn't cottoned
on, but Golly guessed.

09:14.891 --> 09:16.225
And Molly, well, she just
keeps going on and on

09:16.309 --> 09:18.770
about how wonderful it's
gonna be when you get home.

09:20.563 --> 09:22.106
Yeah, well it's really hard.

09:23.316 --> 09:26.402
Because I just can't
look her in the face,

09:26.486 --> 09:28.780
knowing that you don't
want to be laird anymore.

09:34.077 --> 09:35.411
- I want a word with you.

09:35.495 --> 09:36.287
- Yeah.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.832
- Stay away from my daughter.

09:39.916 --> 09:41.376
She's an innocent child,

09:41.459 --> 09:42.919
and way out of your league,

09:43.002 --> 09:46.297
which on reflection,
probably isn't saying much.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.386
- Hey, hang on a minute!

09:51.469 --> 09:52.220
(hand thuds)
(playful music)

09:52.303 --> 09:53.513
Right, that's it.

09:53.596 --> 09:55.098
He's asked for it and
he's gonna get it.

09:55.181 --> 09:58.768
- [Jessica] What is it?

09:58.851 --> 10:00.812
Duncan, where are you going now?

10:00.895 --> 10:04.774
- To do some things, some
very frightening things.

10:04.857 --> 10:05.650
- Can I help?

10:07.193 --> 10:08.111
- Men's business.

10:10.738 --> 10:13.199
- He is really beginning
to get on my wires.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.827
- Maybe he needs taking
down a peg or three?

10:19.580 --> 10:21.499
(door squeaks)

10:21.582 --> 10:22.458
- Oh, Paul.

10:23.501 --> 10:24.293
You okay?

10:29.674 --> 10:31.092
You overheard?

10:31.175 --> 10:34.679
- Archie's giving up
Glenbogle for good.

10:35.972 --> 10:38.057
And Molly doesn't
know, does she?

10:38.141 --> 10:38.933
- No.

10:41.144 --> 10:45.523
But now that you do,
I'll have to tell her.

10:45.606 --> 10:46.774
- Why is he doing this?

10:48.109 --> 10:52.447
- Well, I suppose it's for you.

10:54.991 --> 10:55.783
- For me?

10:58.077 --> 10:59.078
But that's absurd.

11:01.164 --> 11:02.081
No, it's not right.

11:03.624 --> 11:04.917
I can't let Archie do it.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.421
I mean, do you want this?

11:10.214 --> 11:11.466
No, course not.

11:12.425 --> 11:13.801
This is your home.

11:14.969 --> 11:17.680
I won't let this happen, Lexie.

11:19.182 --> 11:21.225
(playful music)

11:21.309 --> 11:23.811
- [Ian] If my
calculations are correct,

11:23.895 --> 11:25.563
the hall in the old castle

11:25.646 --> 11:29.442
where Malcolm was
murdered, was just here,

11:29.525 --> 11:32.820
which would make this
the paranormal hot spot.

11:32.904 --> 11:35.531
- [Beckie] Dad, is
this really necessary?

11:35.615 --> 11:37.992
- Beckie, this could
live in the annals

11:38.076 --> 11:40.119
of parapsychology.

11:40.203 --> 11:42.747
We could see something amazing.

11:42.830 --> 11:43.915
- You said it, matey.

11:43.998 --> 11:46.000
- [Beckie] Goodnight
Dad, I'm off to bed.

11:49.337 --> 11:51.964
- One of the many
mysteries of this house.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.424
I've lived here
for over 40 years,

11:53.508 --> 11:54.801
and I've never seen it open.

11:56.511 --> 11:59.013
I must apologize to you.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.640
- It's all right, Molly.

12:00.723 --> 12:02.058
- No, it isn't.

12:02.141 --> 12:05.061
What I said wasn't very
nice, unforgivably in fact.

12:05.144 --> 12:07.980
- This really isn't necessary.

12:08.064 --> 12:10.650
I know how much
you're missing Archie.

12:10.733 --> 12:13.319
- Well, that is very
generous of you.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.196
Rather a fine old
thing, isn't it?

12:16.656 --> 12:18.491
- You don't know
what's in it, do you?

12:18.574 --> 12:20.410
- No, how tantalizing.

12:22.286 --> 12:24.706
Of course, it could be
something very boring.

12:24.789 --> 12:25.623
On the other hand.

12:40.054 --> 12:40.847
- Ah!

12:44.642 --> 12:45.435
- Ooh!

12:48.813 --> 12:51.691
(sword swooshing)

12:54.736 --> 12:55.528
Ooh!

12:58.698 --> 13:00.074
- Are you there?

13:00.158 --> 13:01.200
Show yourself.

13:01.284 --> 13:03.453
The one who is called Malcolm.

13:03.536 --> 13:05.163
(latch clicking)

13:05.246 --> 13:07.707
- [Molly] Ah, Ian, have you
found something interesting?

13:07.790 --> 13:10.543
- The presence of a
spirit is often indicated

13:10.626 --> 13:13.087
by an unexplained coolness
in the atmosphere.

13:13.171 --> 13:14.672
- Is that so?

13:14.756 --> 13:17.800
- The temperature around
this spot and several others,

13:17.884 --> 13:21.220
is five degrees lower
than the rooms upstairs.

13:21.304 --> 13:23.348
- Yeah, well there's a
good reason for that.

13:23.431 --> 13:25.516
One of the central heating
circuits has packed up,

13:25.600 --> 13:26.517
happens all the time.

13:26.601 --> 13:27.977
- But why, that's the question?

13:29.312 --> 13:30.104
- Broken pump.

13:31.397 --> 13:33.024
- Or a broken spirit.

13:33.107 --> 13:35.818
(playful music)

13:51.250 --> 13:54.671
(strings pinging)

13:54.754 --> 13:57.382
- Oh, one of these, excellent!

14:02.136 --> 14:03.888
(Duncan grunts)

14:03.971 --> 14:05.473
Ha, perfect!

14:05.556 --> 14:08.267
(bagpipes wail)

14:08.351 --> 14:10.812
One, two, three, four, five.

14:13.147 --> 14:14.065
Oh!

14:18.361 --> 14:20.488
(Duncan laughs)

14:20.571 --> 14:21.531
Ah!

14:21.614 --> 14:24.158
(tense music)

14:26.661 --> 14:27.453
What?

14:34.669 --> 14:38.214
(Duncan huffs)

14:38.297 --> 14:41.134
(bagpipes wheeze)

14:42.301 --> 14:45.096
(Duncan panting)

14:48.558 --> 14:51.269
(Duncan grunts)

14:51.352 --> 14:53.396
(Duncan yells)

14:53.479 --> 14:56.858
All right, right,
just stop this now!

14:56.941 --> 14:57.859
What?

14:59.360 --> 15:00.153
Huh?

15:05.241 --> 15:07.410
(door creaking)

15:07.493 --> 15:08.661
(air whooshing)

15:08.745 --> 15:12.081
(Duncan yells)

15:12.165 --> 15:13.499
- Maybe you need a key.

15:26.596 --> 15:27.388
- Okay.

15:31.351 --> 15:32.477
No.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.854
(gentle music)

15:34.937 --> 15:37.607
(keys clinking)

15:47.867 --> 15:48.743
No.

15:48.826 --> 15:49.994
- Ah, disappointing.

16:04.717 --> 16:05.635
(Paul chuckles)
(Molly gasps)

16:05.718 --> 16:09.430
Well done.

16:09.514 --> 16:10.682
Can't read what it says.

16:10.765 --> 16:15.061
(gentle music)
(pen nib scratching)

16:15.144 --> 16:17.730
- [Paul] "Dear
Bertie's belongings."

16:17.814 --> 16:20.149
(lock clicks)

16:20.233 --> 16:21.526
- Go on, open it.

16:35.123 --> 16:36.874
- Antelope or something.

16:36.958 --> 16:37.750
Stinks a bit.

16:39.252 --> 16:41.337
- [Molly] Maybe
Bertie went to Africa?

16:41.421 --> 16:42.839
He did, assagai!

16:59.397 --> 17:01.649
(gentle music)

17:01.733 --> 17:02.525
A soldier.

17:10.950 --> 17:14.454
(Mrs. MacDonald sobbing)

17:16.748 --> 17:18.665
- [Mrs. MacDonald] Oh, my dear.

17:18.750 --> 17:19.791
- Sorry?

17:19.876 --> 17:20.917
- I didn't say anything.

17:29.552 --> 17:31.387
Oh, let's have a look.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.775
A very brave soldier.

17:43.858 --> 17:45.651
- I wonder who Bertie was,

17:47.612 --> 17:48.863
and what happened to him.

17:49.989 --> 17:52.075
(circuits buzzing)
- Oh, not again.

17:52.157 --> 17:55.243
(playful music)

17:55.328 --> 17:58.498
(bagpipe wails)

17:58.581 --> 17:59.374
- Hello?

18:06.130 --> 18:08.799
(playful music)

18:11.594 --> 18:14.055
(bagpipes wail)

18:14.138 --> 18:16.641
(camera whirring)

18:16.724 --> 18:18.851
I'm at the hotspot.

18:20.311 --> 18:24.065
Just coming up to midnight
and things are happening.

18:24.148 --> 18:27.151
(bagpipes wailing)

18:29.237 --> 18:30.655
Hear that?

18:30.738 --> 18:31.614
(bagpipes skirling)

18:31.698 --> 18:34.701
The distant skirl of the pipes.

18:34.784 --> 18:37.245
(Ian gasps)

18:37.328 --> 18:38.454
He's coming!

18:51.801 --> 18:53.928
(eerie music)

18:54.012 --> 18:55.638
I know you're there.

19:00.018 --> 19:02.687
(fist thudding)

19:02.770 --> 19:05.231
(eerie music)

19:07.483 --> 19:08.568
- Who are ye?

19:12.447 --> 19:14.699
What is your purpose here?

19:17.285 --> 19:22.457
Why do you disturb my
peace and tranquility?

19:29.505 --> 19:30.506
- I'm sorry!

19:33.676 --> 19:35.386
- Get back, get back!

19:38.598 --> 19:41.059
Get back, withdraw, take care!

19:43.186 --> 19:47.857
Take care or you will pay!

19:47.940 --> 19:51.027
(props clattering)

19:54.072 --> 19:56.991
(Ian panting)

19:57.075 --> 19:58.659
- [Ian] Speak to me, Malcolm!

19:58.743 --> 20:00.995
Tell me your sad tale!

20:02.288 --> 20:04.999
- Dad, keep the
racket down, will you?

20:05.083 --> 20:08.878
- Oh, how marvelous!

20:13.007 --> 20:15.885
(handle clicking)

20:25.353 --> 20:26.646
(Duncan thuds)

20:26.729 --> 20:29.524
(Duncan panting)

20:32.026 --> 20:32.819
- Ewan?

20:36.406 --> 20:37.990
Jess?

20:38.074 --> 20:40.910
(clock chiming)

20:46.666 --> 20:49.419
(boots thudding)

20:50.712 --> 20:53.423
(gentle music)

20:54.632 --> 20:56.050
- [Albert] Home soon, my dears.

20:56.134 --> 20:59.012
(birds squawking)

21:05.476 --> 21:08.104
(soldiers chattering)

21:08.187 --> 21:11.607
- [Officer] Come on, run for it!

21:11.691 --> 21:14.318
- [Officer] Steady, go!

21:14.402 --> 21:17.405
(horses whickering)

21:21.784 --> 21:23.661
(whistle tooting)

21:23.745 --> 21:24.746
(drums rolling)

21:24.829 --> 21:25.747
- [Squad leader] Alright
boys, on your feet.

21:25.830 --> 21:26.748
Let's get moving.

21:26.831 --> 21:29.292
(tense music)

21:31.252 --> 21:33.546
Keep the line steady, boys.

21:37.091 --> 21:39.927
(birds squawking)

21:42.680 --> 21:43.514
Get down!

21:43.598 --> 21:46.726
(gun bangs)

21:46.809 --> 21:49.729
(air whooshing)

21:51.356 --> 21:53.900
(Paul gasps)

21:57.987 --> 22:00.531
(gentle music)

22:12.794 --> 22:14.921
(birds squawking)

22:15.004 --> 22:16.798
- Just lots of his clothes.

22:16.881 --> 22:17.757
Rather nice clothes,

22:17.840 --> 22:19.008
but nothing to say who he was.

22:19.092 --> 22:19.967
- Intriguing.

22:22.220 --> 22:23.763
Are you all right?

22:23.846 --> 22:25.014
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

22:25.098 --> 22:26.224
I had the weirdest dream.

22:27.475 --> 22:30.395
I just wish I could
find out who he is, was.

22:33.189 --> 22:33.981
- Come with me.

22:36.943 --> 22:38.069
- It was you, wasn't it?

22:38.152 --> 22:39.737
- Oh, don't you start.

22:39.821 --> 22:41.823
- The cellar door routine,
pulling away the rug!

22:41.906 --> 22:43.241
- "Hi, Beckie."

22:43.324 --> 22:45.034
Does Jess know
you're playing away?

22:46.244 --> 22:47.954
- Right, here's the deal,

22:48.037 --> 22:49.163
you cut out all the funny stuff,

22:49.247 --> 22:52.041
and I'll help you with Beckie.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.710
- Or maybe I should
just tell Jess?

22:53.793 --> 22:56.546
- Or maybe you should
away and bake a cake.

22:58.131 --> 22:59.716
- I'm trying Archie's recipe,

22:59.799 --> 23:01.759
but where am I gonna
get ginger, mint,

23:01.843 --> 23:03.845
and cream of tartar on Hogmanay?

23:03.928 --> 23:05.930
- Won't they have
them down the garage?

23:06.014 --> 23:07.515
Ah, just stick anything in.

23:07.598 --> 23:10.143
Nobody's eats the
thing, just for show.

23:10.226 --> 23:11.978
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.187
I mean would you eat something

23:13.271 --> 23:14.731
that looks like a lump of coal?

23:27.326 --> 23:29.620
- Ooh, not so fast, not so fast.

23:29.704 --> 23:30.955
What's this?

23:31.039 --> 23:31.748
- [Molly] You don't
want to see that.

23:31.831 --> 23:32.206
- [Paul] Yes, I do.

23:32.290 --> 23:33.583
Is that-

23:33.666 --> 23:35.501
- It's your father and
I on our wedding day.

23:35.585 --> 23:37.211
Oh, what a sight?

23:37.295 --> 23:39.005
- Absolutely, you look great.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.174
- You won't get
round me like that.

23:51.684 --> 23:52.852
- [Paul] Molly, I've found him.

23:52.935 --> 23:54.270
- Really, how can you tell?

23:54.354 --> 23:57.982
- Well, because of
the uniform, see?

24:02.195 --> 24:05.406
- "Bertie, before he
left us, April, 1899."

24:06.449 --> 24:07.617
Left us?

24:07.700 --> 24:09.535
- South Africa, maybe?

24:09.619 --> 24:10.953
The Boer War.

24:11.037 --> 24:12.205
- [Molly] Oh, look at him.

24:12.288 --> 24:14.540
He's the absolutely
double of you.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.292
- No, you think so?

24:16.376 --> 24:18.378
- Yes, he is.

24:18.461 --> 24:20.296
Except for the face furniture.

24:20.380 --> 24:22.924
Handsome brute, isn't he?

24:23.007 --> 24:24.634
- You won't get round
me like that, Molly.

24:24.717 --> 24:26.427
(both laughing)

24:26.511 --> 24:27.303
- Hi.

24:29.514 --> 24:30.640
Molly, can I have a word?

24:30.723 --> 24:31.849
- Mm hmm.

24:31.933 --> 24:34.060
- It's important.

24:35.770 --> 24:36.771
- I'll leave you to it.

24:47.657 --> 24:50.326
(gentle music)

24:58.543 --> 24:59.502
- Mrs. MacDonald?

25:01.170 --> 25:01.921
Ma'am?

25:07.427 --> 25:10.513
Ma'am, Master Hamish
is waiting to see you.

25:12.181 --> 25:13.808
- [Mrs. MacDonald] Not today.

25:13.891 --> 25:16.185
- But he's not seen
you for three weeks.

25:22.900 --> 25:28.072
- I can't, I can't see him.

25:49.093 --> 25:52.055
- [Housekeeper] Your mother's
not very well today, Hamish.

25:53.014 --> 25:55.433
- Och, well, let's you and me

25:55.516 --> 25:59.062
go and see if we can find
some trout in that river.

25:59.145 --> 26:00.355
- She doesn't want
to see me, does she?

26:00.438 --> 26:02.231
- No, no, it's not that.

26:02.315 --> 26:03.816
- She doesn't love me any more.

26:16.079 --> 26:17.705
- He doesn't want to be laird?

26:20.917 --> 26:22.418
- I'm sorry, Molly.

26:24.921 --> 26:26.047
- He's not coming home?

26:27.590 --> 26:29.133
- For a few weeks, yeah.

26:30.468 --> 26:32.303
Then, well, we don't
have any fixed plans but-

26:32.387 --> 26:33.680
- I don't understand,

26:33.763 --> 26:37.392
it's incredible that the
two of you are leaving.

26:45.983 --> 26:47.860
(upbeat music)

26:47.944 --> 26:50.822
(mallet thudding)

26:52.281 --> 26:55.576
(toothpaste squelching)

27:08.006 --> 27:11.259
Well, I'm glad that's
out in the open anyway.

27:11.342 --> 27:14.053
I knew there was
something worrying you.

27:14.137 --> 27:15.096
- And you're not upset?

27:15.179 --> 27:16.848
- Not in the slightest.

27:16.931 --> 27:19.058
- That's such a relief.

27:19.142 --> 27:21.060
- Because I don't believe
it for one second.

27:21.144 --> 27:21.894
- What?

27:21.978 --> 27:23.438
- Well, it's absurd.

27:23.521 --> 27:25.189
He can't possibly mean it.

27:25.273 --> 27:27.483
Leave Glenbogle and his family,

27:30.445 --> 27:33.031
all so his half-brother can
have the place to himself?

27:33.114 --> 27:34.323
- It's complicated, Molly.

27:34.407 --> 27:35.533
- Did Paul put him up to this?

27:35.616 --> 27:37.035
- No, no.

27:37.118 --> 27:39.162
He's as upset as anyone.

27:39.245 --> 27:40.580
- He knows already?

27:42.290 --> 27:44.834
Well, no one must be upset,

27:44.917 --> 27:47.754
for the simple reason
it's not going to happen.

27:47.837 --> 27:49.339
I can't believe
that for one moment

27:49.422 --> 27:52.342
that Archie could have
meant what he said. (laughs)

27:52.425 --> 27:54.218
I'm going to go and
do some gardening.

27:54.302 --> 27:55.511
- But it's freezing.

27:55.595 --> 27:58.431
I mean, the ground's
rock, rock hard.

28:02.185 --> 28:03.853
- [Beckie] What're you doing?

28:03.936 --> 28:05.438
As if I need to ask.

28:05.521 --> 28:08.316
- Putting last night's
images on the website.

28:08.399 --> 28:11.486
Nearly finished, then
we can go for a walk.

28:11.569 --> 28:13.780
- [Beckie] God, what a way
to spend New Year's Eve.

28:13.863 --> 28:16.449
- Must get the
details right, Beckie,

28:16.532 --> 28:18.159
they can be critical.

28:18.242 --> 28:19.744
- [Beckie] As well as awkward.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.162
- [Ian] What do you mean?

28:22.372 --> 28:24.582
- Your friend,
right, Mad Malcolm?

28:24.665 --> 28:26.542
You said he spoke to you.
- Yes.

28:26.626 --> 28:28.127
- Did he speak to
you in English?

28:28.211 --> 28:29.629
- With a Scots accent.

28:29.712 --> 28:33.633
- Don't you think a 14th century
Highland bandit chieftain,

28:33.716 --> 28:35.510
would actually only
have spoken Gaelic?

28:35.593 --> 28:37.428
- Don't mock me, child.

28:37.512 --> 28:39.722
- I'm not a child.

28:39.806 --> 28:41.599
I know exactly what
all of this is about.

28:41.683 --> 28:42.975
It's about Mum, isn't it?

28:44.811 --> 28:47.563
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

28:47.647 --> 28:49.524
to have a weirdo for a dad?

28:52.985 --> 28:54.654
(door banging)

28:54.737 --> 28:57.323
(gentle music)

29:48.374 --> 29:52.503
- You were a soldier, me too.

29:55.923 --> 29:56.799
Why're you here?

30:00.094 --> 30:01.262
Are you unhappy?

30:02.472 --> 30:06.225
Worried about your family?

30:07.602 --> 30:10.605
A widow grieving and son bereft.

30:10.688 --> 30:13.358
(gentle music)

30:16.027 --> 30:16.903
Where are you?

30:19.030 --> 30:20.573
What do you want me to do?

30:20.656 --> 30:22.658
- And I got a bite
straight away.

30:22.742 --> 30:25.995
We fought and fought,
but finally I landed him.

30:29.123 --> 30:30.917
And with a fly I made myself.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.711
- Hamish, do not speak
with your mouth full.

30:33.795 --> 30:36.214
It is not the mark
of a gentleman.

30:36.297 --> 30:37.090
- [Hamish] Sorry.

30:38.966 --> 30:43.596
- Hamish, your father
is coming home!

30:43.680 --> 30:47.809
The telegram arrived and he's
coming on the overnight train!

30:47.892 --> 30:48.810
- May I?

30:53.147 --> 30:57.527
Mistress, this telegram was
delivered 20 months since.

30:57.610 --> 30:58.820
- It's nonsense.

30:58.903 --> 31:00.321
- And himself was home
on his final leave

31:00.405 --> 31:01.406
before went to the war.

31:03.157 --> 31:04.409
- You're lying.

31:04.492 --> 31:05.618
- He is not coming
home, mistress.

31:06.703 --> 31:08.204
- I won't listen to this.

31:08.287 --> 31:09.163
- He is dead.

31:09.247 --> 31:12.458
- No, no don't dare touch me!

31:14.752 --> 31:17.130
How dare you!

31:17.213 --> 31:20.842
You are poisoning my mind
with your wicked lies!

31:23.845 --> 31:26.764
You will both leave this
house within the hour,

31:26.848 --> 31:29.559
and be thankful that my
husband knows nothing of this.

31:32.395 --> 31:33.813
- They shot him.

31:33.896 --> 31:35.815
(gentle music)

31:35.898 --> 31:37.442
The bullet went here.

31:38.943 --> 31:40.862
The men in Africa killed him.

31:42.196 --> 31:43.740
My father's dead.

31:46.659 --> 31:48.286
- You are wicked a boy.

31:49.495 --> 31:50.413
- I hate you!

31:50.496 --> 31:52.665
- You wicked, wicked boy!

32:01.257 --> 32:04.177
- Jess, what's the
cream of tartar again?

32:06.846 --> 32:08.181
- Isn't that what
Duncan's aunty Liz

32:08.264 --> 32:10.183
rubs on her cheeks every night?

32:10.266 --> 32:12.268
It's a bit like talcum
powder, isn't it?

32:15.146 --> 32:15.980
I'll get you some.

32:23.237 --> 32:25.365
- [Duncan] Oh, hey,
sit there for long

32:25.448 --> 32:26.783
and you'll catch your death.

32:26.866 --> 32:28.409
- [Beckie] I should be so lucky.

32:30.203 --> 32:30.995
- [Duncan] Are you okay?

32:32.497 --> 32:33.790
You not helping you dad?

32:33.873 --> 32:34.832
- Oh, please, the
only help he needs

32:34.916 --> 32:36.584
is in a psychiatric clinic.

32:41.464 --> 32:43.132
- Oh, sorry.

32:46.219 --> 32:47.804
And what about you?

32:47.887 --> 32:50.556
What kind of help do you need?

32:52.141 --> 32:53.976
(Beckie sniffles)

32:54.060 --> 32:57.230
- Oh, hey, you're freezing.

32:57.313 --> 33:00.233
Here, put this on,

33:00.316 --> 33:04.821
and then you can tell your
uncle Duncle, unc Dunc,

33:05.780 --> 33:06.864
all about it.

33:08.741 --> 33:09.575
Aw.

33:12.286 --> 33:14.789
(gentle music)

33:19.293 --> 33:20.378
(bottle thuds)

33:20.461 --> 33:21.212
- Thanks.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.844
- How are you getting
on with Beckie?

33:27.927 --> 33:29.345
- Oh, we're really close,

33:29.429 --> 33:31.097
like I were something
on her shoe.

33:33.016 --> 33:34.726
- Maybe she's keen
on someone else.

33:36.269 --> 33:37.270
- That's really sad.

33:38.563 --> 33:40.106
- I don't know how
it's gonna end.

33:45.069 --> 33:47.989
- Why don't I just go and
talk to him, man to man?

33:48.072 --> 33:49.657
- No, he won't listen.

33:56.205 --> 33:57.540
- I'll make him.

33:57.623 --> 34:00.418
(Beckie giggles)

34:11.679 --> 34:12.764
Aye, aye!

34:12.847 --> 34:14.139
(Ian grunts)
Ooh, sorry,

34:15.391 --> 34:16.559
did I give you a shock?

34:17.893 --> 34:19.478
I wanted to ask you,

34:19.562 --> 34:23.315
of all your experiences
with ghouls and ghosties,

34:23.399 --> 34:27.070
what's been the scariest,
you know, like the most real?

34:27.152 --> 34:28.987
- Well, last night was
up there with the best,

34:29.072 --> 34:30.322
I can tell you.

34:30.406 --> 34:32.824
- Ooh, yeah, it
was a put up job.

34:32.909 --> 34:35.203
I did it with a
torch and a megaphone

34:35.286 --> 34:40.123
and an old fiddle, and the off
switch on the power supply.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.208
- Don't be absurd.

34:45.463 --> 34:46.589
- So, that must leave something,

34:46.672 --> 34:49.467
way out on its own, hey, Ian?

34:50.717 --> 34:52.804
Would that be when
your wife came to you?

34:56.766 --> 34:59.352
(upbeat music)

35:22.709 --> 35:24.127
- It was a Wednesday night,

35:24.210 --> 35:25.712
I was away at a conference.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.298
I never forgive myself for that.

35:29.382 --> 35:31.509
But I wasn't there, you know?

35:31.592 --> 35:33.094
Driving instead of her.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.723
Two days after the funeral,

35:36.805 --> 35:40.517
I was sitting in
the conservatory
feeling so very low,

35:42.060 --> 35:44.230
looking out into the
garden she made and loved.

35:45.647 --> 35:47.191
And then suddenly she was there,

35:48.609 --> 35:49.986
walking along the border,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.530
right up to the window
where I was sitting.

35:55.408 --> 35:57.535
- [Duncan] What happened next?

35:57.618 --> 36:00.328
- She smiled, gave
a little wave,

36:01.872 --> 36:05.626
walked away through the poppies
and then she disappeared.

36:08.170 --> 36:09.797
- [Duncan] Have
you seen her again?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.635
- I suppose that's what
all this is about really,

36:16.220 --> 36:18.222
hoping somehow she'll
come to me again.

36:19.807 --> 36:20.808
- Perhaps she will.

36:24.562 --> 36:28.649
But listen, all this
Mad Malcolm rubbish.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.318
- It's not.

36:30.401 --> 36:32.236
- Well, maybe it is
and maybe it isn't,

36:32.320 --> 36:34.864
but don't you think it's time

36:34.947 --> 36:36.240
you thought a little
less about the dead,

36:36.324 --> 36:38.368
and a little more
about the living?

36:40.536 --> 36:41.704
You've a lovely daughter, Ian,

36:41.788 --> 36:43.331
and she's already lost her mum,

36:43.414 --> 36:46.042
and, well in a way,

36:46.125 --> 36:47.460
she's lost her dad too.

36:49.754 --> 36:51.673
- I was cold even with this on.

36:51.756 --> 36:52.548
- Oh.

36:54.967 --> 36:55.760
- Hi, Dad.

36:57.595 --> 36:58.388
- Beckie.

37:06.396 --> 37:08.481
Why don't you and me
go somewhere and talk?

37:10.274 --> 37:11.943
- [Beckie] Thanks, Dad.

37:12.026 --> 37:14.612
(gentle music)

37:18.157 --> 37:19.701
- Hi, sweetheart.

37:19.784 --> 37:24.956
(foot thuds)
(Duncan yells)

37:26.124 --> 37:27.875
What have I done now?

37:38.678 --> 37:41.264
(gentle music)

37:46.019 --> 37:46.769
(toys clattering)

37:46.853 --> 37:49.731
(flame whooshing)

37:53.026 --> 37:53.818
- Papa.

38:07.331 --> 38:08.833
- He's not coming back, Molly.

38:10.668 --> 38:11.961
Not in the way you want.

38:15.173 --> 38:15.965
- No.

38:20.094 --> 38:22.638
(gentle music)

38:26.851 --> 38:29.854
(Mrs. MacDonald gasping)

38:29.937 --> 38:32.690
- He is coming home.

38:32.774 --> 38:34.984
He is coming home.

38:35.068 --> 38:38.154
- [Groundskeeper] Oh my
God, there is a fire!

38:38.237 --> 38:40.281
- Hurry!
- A fire in the boathouse!

38:40.365 --> 38:41.199
- [Man] A fire!

38:41.282 --> 38:42.575
- Hurry up now,
- Hurry!

38:42.658 --> 38:44.243
- we need some water here.
- Come on!

38:44.327 --> 38:47.747
(flames roaring)
(people shouting)

38:47.830 --> 38:49.123
- [Man] Water!

38:49.207 --> 38:51.417
- Hamish, Hamish!

38:51.501 --> 38:52.794
- Help me!

38:52.877 --> 38:56.047
- There you are, there you are.

38:56.130 --> 38:57.840
Hold on, I'm coming!

39:01.928 --> 39:02.679
(wood crashing)

39:02.762 --> 39:03.554
Come on!

39:06.307 --> 39:08.685
- Oi, hurry now!
- Come on, now, come on.

39:08.768 --> 39:10.186
(groundskeeper coughing)

39:10.269 --> 39:11.562
- [Man] Hurry, come on now!

39:11.646 --> 39:12.563
- [Man] Will everyone
get out of there?

39:12.647 --> 39:15.400
Oh my God!
- Hamish! (coughs)

39:15.483 --> 39:17.402
- Oh, come on!
- Hamish!

39:18.361 --> 39:21.989
Quick, help me move this, hurry!

39:22.073 --> 39:24.033
(people shouting)
- Shift this away!

39:24.117 --> 39:26.369
- Come on!
- More water!

39:26.452 --> 39:30.081
- That's it, that's it.
- Come on!

39:30.164 --> 39:31.416
- Come on, come on.
- I want you

39:31.499 --> 39:34.377
to go after three.
(people shouting)

39:34.460 --> 39:36.963
One, two, three.
- Jump!

39:37.046 --> 39:39.007
- Yes!
- Good boy!

39:39.090 --> 39:40.842
- Hamish, come on.
- All right, jump.

39:40.925 --> 39:42.176
- We're here.

39:42.260 --> 39:44.971
Oh God, you're-
- Get out of here!

39:45.054 --> 39:46.931
(groundskeeper grunting)
- Come on!

39:47.015 --> 39:48.891
(people shouting)
- Jump!

39:48.975 --> 39:50.101
(groundskeeper grunting)
(hay swishing)

39:50.184 --> 39:52.353
- Well done.
- Hurry up with the water!

39:52.437 --> 39:55.064
- Oh, my darling boy.

39:55.148 --> 39:56.983
I almost lost you too.

39:58.526 --> 39:59.861
- And a bucket.
- See here.

39:59.944 --> 40:01.988
- [Man] You all
right, you all right?

40:02.071 --> 40:04.615
(gentle music)

40:17.545 --> 40:18.963
- My future's been stolen.

40:20.298 --> 40:23.343
I could see it all,
dear Archie and Lexie,

40:25.094 --> 40:27.513
making their life here,
making the place sing,

40:28.681 --> 40:30.641
maybe with my
grandchildren around me.

40:32.518 --> 40:36.272
And now, well how
did it happen, Golly?

40:38.024 --> 40:38.983
- Just life, Molly.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.071
Nobody planned it,
it's nobody's fault,

40:44.405 --> 40:45.615
especially not Paul's.

40:48.951 --> 40:51.496
Anyway, isn't a fine gift

40:51.579 --> 40:53.539
for one brother to
give to another?

40:56.834 --> 40:58.503
- Yes, yes.
- Hmm.

41:02.048 --> 41:05.426
I just hope Paul is of
a mind to accept it.

41:13.434 --> 41:16.312
- Where are you, big fella?

41:16.396 --> 41:17.563
What you doing, lying low?

41:20.692 --> 41:23.986
Come on, another soldier
wants to talk to you.

41:36.374 --> 41:37.709
Everything's fine.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.627
I've been through
the family records.

41:41.087 --> 41:43.297
Your wife and son
seemed to have got over

41:44.382 --> 41:45.550
what happened to you.

41:46.759 --> 41:48.511
She remarried a few years later.

41:50.304 --> 41:52.348
No, he looks a nice man.

41:56.102 --> 41:57.478
That's their wedding picture.

42:00.606 --> 42:03.151
They had two more
children, girls, I think,

42:03.234 --> 42:04.485
for Hamish to play with.

42:05.737 --> 42:07.864
He grew up a big strapping lad.

42:13.953 --> 42:16.664
Here he is, rowing at Cambridge.

42:16.748 --> 42:17.665
(gentle music)

42:17.749 --> 42:20.168
He became Laird of Glenbogle,

42:20.251 --> 42:22.587
and he married and had
four children of his own.

42:26.257 --> 42:30.136
Now, here they all
are as youngsters.

42:31.304 --> 42:33.181
That's my father, Hector,

42:33.264 --> 42:34.724
who became laird in his turn.

42:36.768 --> 42:38.144
I never knew your son,

42:38.227 --> 42:40.688
but my stepmother says he
lived to a sprightly old age.

42:44.484 --> 42:47.236
There he is just before he died.

42:51.449 --> 42:52.241
That's it.

42:59.874 --> 43:03.878
All of which makes you
my great-grandfather.

43:07.256 --> 43:10.301
There's a chance that I might
be Laird of Glenbogle myself.

43:11.678 --> 43:13.471
I wasn't sure it
was for the best,

43:15.556 --> 43:20.728
but meeting you, this
is all very strange.

43:23.690 --> 43:24.482
- What is?

43:26.067 --> 43:27.235
(Lexie laughs)

43:27.318 --> 43:29.278
Talking to yourself, eh?

43:29.362 --> 43:31.447
This place must be
really getting to you.

43:34.242 --> 43:36.244
- Maybe it is.

43:36.327 --> 43:39.914
- Look, I'm not sure what you're
gonna be wearing to the do,

43:39.997 --> 43:43.543
but I think you'd
look great in this.

43:44.836 --> 43:48.297
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

43:48.381 --> 43:50.216
- Paul, are you there?

43:51.467 --> 43:52.385
I found this.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.430
It belonged to your
grandfather, Hamish.

43:55.513 --> 43:57.223
Traditional MacDonald tartan,

43:57.306 --> 43:59.183
70 years old and
probably moth eaten.

44:01.436 --> 44:02.478
I'd like you to have it.

44:03.730 --> 44:06.649
- Thank you, Molly, both of you.

44:09.777 --> 44:11.237
Tough choice.
- Mm hmm.

44:12.280 --> 44:14.949
(cars rumbling)

44:17.744 --> 44:18.494
(people cheering)
(people clapping)

44:18.578 --> 44:21.664
(upbeat folk music)

44:25.835 --> 44:28.713
(people cheering)

44:36.346 --> 44:37.597
- "What's the matter?"

44:37.680 --> 44:38.931
I will tell you
what's the matter.

44:39.015 --> 44:40.350
- Thought you might.

44:40.433 --> 44:42.518
- You can't seem to take
anything seriously, Duncan,

44:42.602 --> 44:43.895
us included.

44:43.978 --> 44:46.147
Either you're playing
daft lad tricks on Ian.

44:46.230 --> 44:47.565
- Oh, you can talk!

44:47.648 --> 44:49.650
- Or you're fooling
around with his daughter.

44:49.734 --> 44:50.485
- What?

44:52.153 --> 44:54.655
- Either way, it's not very
mature behavior is it, Duncan?

44:56.741 --> 44:57.909
What are you, Duncan?

44:57.992 --> 44:59.160
A daft lad or a man?

45:00.787 --> 45:03.498
- Can I get back
to you on that one?

45:03.581 --> 45:04.374
Joke!

45:07.585 --> 45:10.129
(Duncan sighs)

45:12.090 --> 45:15.802
- Dunc, we need more
champagne for midnight.

45:21.808 --> 45:24.686
- "What are you, Duncan,
a daft lad or a man?"

45:24.769 --> 45:27.855
Well, I'm trying
to prove it to you,

45:27.939 --> 45:30.108
without much encouragement.

45:35.196 --> 45:36.155
(Duncan sighs)

45:36.239 --> 45:37.907
Give me a break!

45:37.990 --> 45:39.283
Jess, Ewan?

45:40.243 --> 45:44.122
(lamp shade clattering)

45:44.205 --> 45:46.290
Is that you getting
your own back, is it?

45:48.584 --> 45:50.920
It's pretty immature,
if you ask me.

45:52.630 --> 45:55.925
(wine racks rattling)

45:59.303 --> 46:02.557
All right, you've
made, that's quite.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.101
Look, whatever it is you're
doing, just stop now!

46:05.184 --> 46:08.062
(air whooshing)
(Duncan yelling)

46:08.146 --> 46:11.524
(glass smashing)

46:11.607 --> 46:13.359
(Mad Malcolm laughing)

46:13.443 --> 46:16.112
(upbeat folk music)
(guests cheering)

46:16.195 --> 46:19.032
- You must both do
what you think best.

46:19.115 --> 46:21.075
I shall be happy
as long as you are.

46:21.159 --> 46:22.618
- I'm sure we will be.

46:24.037 --> 46:24.829
- Oh, yes.

46:25.747 --> 46:29.125
- Oh!
(Molly clapping)

46:29.208 --> 46:30.877
- [Lexie] Ooh!

46:30.960 --> 46:32.879
- Ah, that's very nice, eh?

46:32.962 --> 46:35.465
(Jess wolf whistling)

46:35.548 --> 46:36.424
- What do you think?

46:36.507 --> 46:38.676
Maybe I should have worn a suit.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.679
- Nonsense, your father
would have been proud of you.

46:42.930 --> 46:44.140
- Thank you, Molly.

46:44.223 --> 46:47.143
- And your legs aren't a
complete embarrassment.

46:47.226 --> 46:48.269
- Well, I could say
he same about yours.

46:48.353 --> 46:49.228
(Lexie laughs)

46:49.312 --> 46:50.188
- Cheek!

46:50.271 --> 46:51.272
Ah, we'll soon see about that.

46:51.356 --> 46:52.940
- What?

46:53.024 --> 46:55.485
- The final stages in you
becoming a proper Jock.

46:55.568 --> 46:56.861
Scottish country dancing!

46:56.944 --> 46:58.279
- Oh no!

46:58.363 --> 46:59.280
- [Lexie, Molly
And Golly] Oh yes!

46:59.364 --> 47:01.741
(Lexie laughing)

47:01.824 --> 47:04.369
(Man laughing)

47:13.002 --> 47:13.878
- What's the matter with you?

47:13.961 --> 47:15.880
- Look like you've seen a ghost.

47:15.963 --> 47:17.215
- Oh, ha ha, very funny.

47:18.508 --> 47:20.009
It was you two again, wasn't it?

47:20.093 --> 47:22.720
- Duncan.
- Oh, hi.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.723
- My dad and I.

47:25.807 --> 47:27.850
- We wanted you to thank you
for what you've done for us.

47:27.934 --> 47:28.893
- Yeah.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.186
- [Duncan] Oh, don't be daft.

47:30.269 --> 47:31.646
- We got you a present.

47:31.729 --> 47:33.356
- Nothing much, just a bottle.

47:33.439 --> 47:36.025
- Ah, thanks very much.

47:39.070 --> 47:40.905
- You're a lovely guy.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.161
You're a lucky girl.

47:49.539 --> 47:50.289
Come on, Dad.

47:54.877 --> 47:56.754
(guests chattering)
- Ah, come on!

47:56.838 --> 48:02.010
- Right, time to get on with
more of that daft lad stuff.

48:03.761 --> 48:04.554
- Duncan?

48:06.639 --> 48:09.726
(upbeat folk music)

48:13.771 --> 48:14.731
(guests whooping)

48:14.814 --> 48:17.483
(gentle music)

48:20.945 --> 48:23.698
(bells tinkling)

48:31.122 --> 48:36.294
(clock bell chiming)
(guests cheering)

48:37.211 --> 48:40.298
(bagpipes skirling)

48:44.093 --> 48:45.928
- Happy New Year, Dad.

48:47.430 --> 48:50.099
- Sorry I misjudged you.

48:50.183 --> 48:52.226
- You're forgiven, but don't
you ever do that again.

48:53.811 --> 48:56.939
(lips smooching)

48:57.023 --> 48:58.483
- [Jess And Ewan]
Happy New Year!

48:59.734 --> 49:03.404
- Lexie, I can't find the words.

49:03.488 --> 49:05.281
- Oh, Molly, happy New Year.

49:05.365 --> 49:08.159
(fists thudding)

49:10.203 --> 49:12.080
- Anyway.
- Happy New Year!

49:12.163 --> 49:13.623
- [Lexie And Golly]
Happy New Year, Paul.

49:13.706 --> 49:15.583
- Coal for your fire,

49:15.667 --> 49:17.460
and something else
to keep you warm.

49:18.711 --> 49:20.380
- [Golly] Happy New Year, Molly.

49:20.463 --> 49:21.964
- Dear, dear man.

49:26.928 --> 49:30.848
Paul, I must apologize for not
making things easy for you.

49:30.932 --> 49:32.600
- I should be
saying that to you.

49:32.684 --> 49:35.937
- In future, I shall
endeavor to do better.

49:36.020 --> 49:38.272
I hope the new year brings
you all good things.

49:39.607 --> 49:42.068
- Thank you, Molly, and you.

49:43.736 --> 49:45.947
Now, you must cook
the New Year cake,

49:46.030 --> 49:46.989
Ewan's black bun.

49:48.866 --> 49:54.038
(guests applauding)
(guests cheering)

49:58.960 --> 50:04.132
(guests applauding)
(guests cheering)

50:04.882 --> 50:06.009
- I'd just like to say-

50:06.092 --> 50:08.344
- Happy New Year? (laughs)

50:09.595 --> 50:11.597
- I like to say thank
you to all of you,

50:12.890 --> 50:16.728
especially Molly
and Lexie, Golly,

50:16.811 --> 50:19.147
Duncan, Jessica and Ewan,

50:19.230 --> 50:20.815
for making me feel so at home.

50:22.567 --> 50:26.320
I never thought it would
happen, but I'm at peace here.

50:28.322 --> 50:32.285
It's amazing, small miracle.

50:35.496 --> 50:36.456
A toast.

50:38.166 --> 50:41.711
To Archie, a man I am
privileged to call my brother,

50:43.379 --> 50:46.758
and to a soldier
none of us knew.

50:49.302 --> 50:50.511
Absent friends

50:51.804 --> 50:54.682
- [Everyone] Absent friends.

50:54.766 --> 50:56.142
- Right, (laughs)

50:56.225 --> 50:57.560
roll up, roll up,

50:57.643 --> 51:01.314
it's time to taste Ewan's
incredible black bun! (laughs)

51:01.397 --> 51:02.607
- Sh!
- What do we do with it?

51:02.690 --> 51:04.734
Do we eat it or
light fires with it?

51:04.817 --> 51:08.196
- You know, I think Beckie
ought to be the first to try it.

51:08.279 --> 51:12.241
(Duncan laughing)
- Please, God.

51:12.325 --> 51:14.369
- It's really tasty, Ewan,

51:14.452 --> 51:16.037
and kind of tangy.

51:19.165 --> 51:21.376
- That'll be the toothpaste.

51:21.459 --> 51:22.877
Mint.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.463
- So, there's talent up here
in the Highlands after all.

52:45.585 --> 52:48.463
(water splashing)

52:50.340 --> 52:52.383

a bag of nuts for your mum?

- Bye.

52:55.636 --> 52:58.348
- [Group] Happy New Year!

52:58.431 --> 53:02.477
- Tell you what though, that
billiard table thing was mad,

53:02.560 --> 53:06.773
but that stunt you pulled
in the cellar was amazing.

53:06.856 --> 53:08.441
- What?

53:08.524 --> 53:09.442
- You know, the thing with
the exploding bottles,

53:09.525 --> 53:11.778
and (mimics smashing), you know?

53:11.861 --> 53:14.072
How did you do that?

53:14.155 --> 53:15.406
- It must be the drink.

53:15.490 --> 53:16.240
(group laughing)

53:16.324 --> 53:17.742
- I mean, come on, lads!

53:17.825 --> 53:19.869
- Duncan, what are
you talking about?

53:19.952 --> 53:24.207
