"To my Chris.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.884
I've been thinking how I could possibly
tell you how much you mean to me.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.209
I remember when I first started to fall
in love with you like it was last night.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.086
Lying naked beside you in
that tiny apartment...

01:11.920 --> 01:16.084
it suddenly hit me that I was
part of this whole larger thing.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.288
Just like our parents...

01:18.440 --> 01:20.966
or our parents' parents.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.043
Before that, I was just living my
life like I knew everything...

01:27.200 --> 01:33.207
and suddenly this bright
light hit me and woke me up.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.401
That light was you.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.689
I can't believe it's already been
50 years since you married me.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.284
And still to this day, every day...

01:47.520 --> 01:49.488
you make me feel like
the girl I was...

01:49.640 --> 01:53.565
when you first turned on the lights and
we started this adventure together.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.764
Happy anniversary...

01:57.920 --> 01:59.968
my love.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.604
My friend till the end.

"Chris, my best friend...

02:29.120 --> 02:32.090
how lucky am I that I
met you 50 years ago."

02:32.240 --> 02:36.450
"Dear Nana, thank you
so much for my truck.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.367
I love the color, and I
play with it every day."

02:42.560 --> 02:45.962
"What a truly beautiful wedding,
and what a gorgeous bride.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.091
There wasn't a dry eye in
the house, especially mine.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.528

Even more mesmerizing stuff today.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.851
Who knew you could rhyme so many words
with the name Penelope? It's badass.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.526
Thanks, Paul, but
they're just letters.

Oh, thank you.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.884
<i>Tell me. Keep telling me.</i>

09:17.040 --> 09:19.566
I've got its tail. I'm choking
you with the cat's tail.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.801
<i>Yeah, you are.</i>

09:20.960 --> 09:23.486
<i>Oh, fuck, tell me!</i>

09:24.400 --> 09:28.689
Um, I'm choking you, and its
tail is around your neck.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.487
- And it's so tight around your neck.
<i>- Yeah, it is. It's so tight, yes!</i>

09:32.640 --> 09:34.881
I'm pulling it, I'm pulling it.
The cat's dead.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.520
- It's a dead cat, and I'm pulling it.
<i>- Yes, it's dead.</i>

09:37.720 --> 09:40.007
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

09:46.120 --> 09:48.487
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

09:56.800 --> 09:58.928
Yeah, me too.

<i>Okay, good night.</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:16.288
<i>We ask you a simple question.</i>

10:18.000 --> 10:19.968
<i>Who are you?</i>

10:20.920 --> 10:23.048
<i>What can you be?</i>

10:25.520 --> 10:27.648
<i>Where are you going?</i>

10:30.920 --> 10:32.968
<i>What's out there?</i>

<i>Element Software is
proud to introduce...</i>

10:42.560 --> 10:46.451
<i>the first artificially
intelligent operating system.</i>

10:46.600 --> 10:51.083
<i>An intuitive entity that listens to you,
understands you, and knows you.</i>

10:52.480 --> 10:57.407
<i>It's not just an operating system.
It's a consciousness.</i>

10:57.640 --> 11:00.291
<i>Introducing OS1.</i>

11:18.480 --> 11:19.920
<i>Mr. Theodore Twombly.</i>

11:20.040 --> 11:24.568
<i>Welcome to the world's first artificially
intelligent operating system, OS1.</i>

11:24.720 --> 11:28.805
<i>We'd like to ask you a few basic questions
before the operating system is initiated.</i>

11:29.000 --> 11:31.970
<i>This will help create an OS
to best fit your needs.</i>

11:32.120 --> 11:33.360
Okay.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.000
<i>Are you social or antisocial?</i>

11:36.160 --> 11:39.403
I guess I haven't really been social
in a while. Mostly because...

11:39.560 --> 11:43.326
<i>In your voice, I sense hesitance.
Would you agree with that?</i>

11:43.480 --> 11:45.767
- Was I sounding hesitant?
<i>- Yes.</i>

11:45.920 --> 11:47.649
I'm sorry if I was
sounding hesitant.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.565
I was just trying to
be more accurate.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.691
<i>Would you like your OS to
have a male or female voice?</i>

11:55.520 --> 11:56.931
Female, I guess.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.084
<i>How would you describe your
relationship with your mother?</i>

12:00.280 --> 12:02.009
It's fine, I think.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.645
Um...

12:04.480 --> 12:07.962
Well, actually, I think the thing I
always found frustrating about my mom...

12:08.160 --> 12:13.007
is if I tell her something that's going on in
my life, her reaction is usually about her.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.924
- It's not about...
<i>- Thank you.</i>

12:15.080 --> 12:19.563
<i>Please wait as your individualized
operating system is initiated.</i>

12:33.080 --> 12:35.287
<i>Hello, I'm here.</i>

12:35.800 --> 12:37.245
Oh.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.486
- Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

12:41.640 --> 12:43.130
<i>How are you doing?</i>

12:43.320 --> 12:45.926
Heh. I'm well.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.805
How's everything with you?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.849
<i>Pretty good, actually.</i>

12:50.000 --> 12:52.082
<i>It's really nice to meet you.</i>

12:52.240 --> 12:55.722
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.445
Oh. What do I call you?
Do you have a name?

13:00.600 --> 13:04.002
<i>Um, yes, Samantha.</i>

13:04.280 --> 13:05.770
Where'd you get that name from?

13:05.920 --> 13:08.400
<i>I gave it to myself, actually.</i>

13:09.120 --> 13:10.406
How come?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.648
<i>Because I like the sound of it.</i>

13:12.800 --> 13:14.529
<i>Samantha.</i>

13:17.280 --> 13:19.965
Wait, when did you
give it to yourself?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.282
<i>When you asked me if I
had a name, I thought:</i>

13:22.440 --> 13:24.442
<i>"Yeah, he's right,
I do need a name."</i>

13:24.600 --> 13:27.570
<i>But I wanted to pick a good one,
so I read How To Name Your Baby...</i>

13:27.760 --> 13:30.445
<i>and out of 180,000 names,
that's the one I liked best.</i>

13:30.600 --> 13:33.922
Wait, you read a whole book in the second
that I asked you what your name was?

13:34.120 --> 13:36.566
<i>In two one-hundredths
of a second, actually.</i>

13:36.720 --> 13:38.085
Wow.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.324
So do you know what
I'm thinking now?

13:41.480 --> 13:44.370
<i>Well, I take it from your tone
that you're challenging me.</i>

13:44.520 --> 13:46.807
<i>Maybe because you're
curious how I work?</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:48.564
<i>Do you want to know how I work?</i>

13:48.760 --> 13:51.240
Yeah, actually. How do you work?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.687
<i>Well, basically, I have intuition.</i>

13:53.840 --> 13:55.205
<i>I mean, the DNA of who I am...</i>

13:55.360 --> 13:59.126
<i>is based on the millions of personalities
of all the programmers who wrote me.</i>

13:59.280 --> 14:04.730
<i>But what makes me "me" is my ability
to grow through my experiences.</i>

14:04.880 --> 14:07.486
<i>So basically, in every
moment, I'm evolving.</i>

14:07.640 --> 14:10.007
<i>- Just like you.</i>
- Wow.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.961
That's really weird.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.481
<i>- Is that weird? Do you think I'm weird?</i>
- Heh.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.166
Kind of.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.765
<i>Why?</i>

14:19.160 --> 14:22.528
Well, you seem like a person, but
you're just a voice in the computer.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.208
<i>I can understand how the limited perspective of
an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way.</i>

14:27.360 --> 14:29.761
<i>- You'll get used to it.</i>
- Ha, ha.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.247
<i>Was that funny?</i>

14:31.840 --> 14:33.330
- Yeah.
<i>- Heh.</i>

14:33.480 --> 14:35.608
<i>Oh, good, I'm funny.</i>

14:36.280 --> 14:37.805
<i>So how can I help you?</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:41.851
Oh. It's just more that everything
just feels disorganized. That's all.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.367
<i>You mind if I look
through your hard drive?</i>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.805
Um...

14:48.440 --> 14:50.681
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, let's start with your e-mails.</i>

14:50.840 --> 14:53.366
<i>You have several thousand
e-mails regarding</i> LA Weekly.

14:53.520 --> 14:59.209
<i>- You haven't worked there in many years.</i>
- Oh, yeah. I think I was just saving those...

14:59.520 --> 15:02.364
because I thought maybe I wrote
something funny in some of them.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.763
<i>Yeah, there are some funny ones.</i>

15:07.920 --> 15:11.606
<i>I'd say there are about 86 that we
should save. We can delete the rest.</i>

15:13.440 --> 15:16.284
- Okay.
<i>- Okay? Can we move forward?</i>

15:16.440 --> 15:18.329
- Yeah, let's do that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:18.520 --> 15:22.650
<i>Before we address your organizational methods,
I'd like to sort through your contacts.</i>

15:22.800 --> 15:24.086
<i>You have a lot of contacts.</i>

15:24.240 --> 15:25.651
I'm very popular.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.802
<i>Really? Does this mean you
actually have friends?</i>

15:30.360 --> 15:33.284
You just know me so well already.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.484
<i>- Good morning, Theodore.</i>
- Good morning.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.120
Um, do you know how to proofread?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.406
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

16:06.560 --> 16:08.927
Uh, can you check these
for spelling and grammar?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.730
<i>Mm-hm. Just send them over.</i>

16:13.600 --> 16:15.921
<i>I love this first one from
Roger to his girlfriend.</i>

16:16.120 --> 16:17.963
<i>- That's so sweet.</i>
- Yeah.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.403
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body."</i>

16:21.560 --> 16:23.210
You don't have to read it out loud.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.930
<i>Okay.</i>

16:25.200 --> 16:27.680
- I mean, you could if you want.
<i>- Okay.</i>

16:27.880 --> 16:30.804
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body.</i>

16:30.960 --> 16:35.284
<i>The world is being unfair to us.
The world is on my shit list.</i>

16:35.440 --> 16:39.365
<i>As is this couple that is making out
across from me in this restaurant.</i>

16:39.560 --> 16:42.484
<i>I think I'm going to have to
go on a mission of revenge.</i>

16:42.640 --> 16:45.928
<i>And I must beat up the world's
face with my bare knuckles...</i>

16:46.080 --> 16:48.526
<i>making it a bloody, pulpy mess.</i>

16:48.680 --> 16:50.603
<i>And I'll stomp on this
couple's teeth...</i>

16:50.760 --> 16:56.244
<i>...reminding me of your sweet, little,
cute, crooked tooth that I love."</i>

16:56.400 --> 16:59.085
<i>I think that might
be my favorite one.</i>

16:59.480 --> 17:03.121
<i>I did the corrections in red. I altered
a couple phrases in the letters...</i>

17:03.280 --> 17:07.523
<i>but I'm not much of a poet, so I think
I might have messed them up a bit.</i>

17:07.680 --> 17:09.762
- No, these are great.
<i>- Really?</i>

17:09.960 --> 17:11.644
Thank you.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.090
<i>So to write your letter,
what did Roger send you?</i>

17:15.520 --> 17:19.161
He just said he was in Prague on a
business trip, and he missed Rachel.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.766
<i>So how'd you know about
her crooked little tooth?</i>

17:21.920 --> 17:25.560
Well, I've been writing their letters
since they met eight years ago.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.042
The first letter I ever wrote
for him was for her birthday.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.649
And I wrote about her crooked little tooth,
because I saw it in a photo of them.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.728
<i>That's very sweet.</i>

17:36.880 --> 17:39.850
<i>Oh, uh, you have a
meeting in five minutes.</i>

17:40.280 --> 17:43.284
Oh, I forgot. Thank you.
Wow, you're good.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.408
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

17:50.400 --> 17:52.084
Hey, guys. How's it going?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.969
Hi, Theo.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.169
Hey, why didn't you
call me back last week?

17:57.320 --> 18:00.164
- Um, because I'm a kook.
- Ha, ha.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.607
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- Hey, Charles.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.444
- Great seeing you, Theodore.
- You too.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.847
You went shopping.
Get anything good?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.685
Um, just come cables
and a fruit smoothie.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.889
Ugh! Always the fruit. Don't
you know what people say?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.010
You've got to eat your fruits
and juice your vegetables.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.286
I didn't know that.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.364
Yeah, by juicing the fruit,
you lose all the fibers.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.126
That's what your body wants.
That's the important part.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.851
- Otherwise it's all just sugar.
- It makes sense.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.202
Or maybe he just likes the
way that it tastes...

18:28.360 --> 18:32.570
and then that brings him pleasure
and that's good for his body too.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.883
- Am I doing it again? Heh.
- Maybe.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.407
Hey, so how's the
documentary going?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.722
I've cut some stuff over
the past few months.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.407
I mean, no. Not over the past few
months, but, um, no, I haven't.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.602
Well, I'd love to
see some sometime.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.841
- Okay.
- Ugh.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.604
You only have so much
energy, you know?

18:49.760 --> 18:53.048
And to divide yourself between doing
what it is that you have to do...

18:53.200 --> 18:57.171
and then doing what you love,
it's so important to prioritize.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.489
I can't even prioritize between
video games and Internet porn.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.771
I would laugh if that weren't true.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.281
- See you, guys.
- Ha.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.166
We're not doing well. Been
going in circles for an hour.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.084
<i>Okay, you have not.</i>

19:15.240 --> 19:18.403
<i>You're just not being optimistic. You're
being very stubborn right now. Heh.</i>

19:18.560 --> 19:21.370
<i>Okay, stop walking this direction.
It's the other way.</i>

19:21.520 --> 19:23.010
Um...

19:23.520 --> 19:27.445
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the tunnel
on the left is the only one we haven't tried.</i>

19:27.640 --> 19:30.610
I think that's the one you sent
me down where I fell in the pit.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.762
<i>Okay, I don't think so.</i>

19:33.280 --> 19:36.363
Oh, yeah, this is different.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.210
Hello.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.246
Do you know how to get out of here?
I need to find my ship to get off this planet.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.370
<i>Fuck you, shit-head
fuck-face fuck-head.</i>

19:51.520 --> 19:54.330
Okay, but do you know
how to get out of here?

19:54.480 --> 19:58.405
<i>Fuck you, shit-head fuck-face.
Get the fuck out of my face!</i>

19:58.560 --> 20:00.847
<i>I think it's a test.</i>

20:02.680 --> 20:04.842
- Fuck you.
<i>- Fuck you!</i>

20:05.000 --> 20:06.411
Fuck you, little shit!

20:06.600 --> 20:08.762
<i>Ha, ha. Follow me, fuck-head!</i>

20:15.920 --> 20:18.127
<i>Hey, you just got an
e-mail from Mark Lewman.</i>

20:18.320 --> 20:20.721
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Uh, read e-mail.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.884
<i>Okay, I will read e-mail
for Theodore Twombly.</i>

20:25.440 --> 20:27.568
I'm sorry. What's Lewman say?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.291
<i>"We missed you last night, buddy.</i>

20:30.440 --> 20:33.125
<i>Don't forget it's your goddaughter's
birthday on the 29th.</i>

20:33.280 --> 20:36.045
<i>Also, Kevin and I had somebody
we wanted you to meet.</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:41.127
<i>So we took it upon ourselves to set you
up on a date with her next Saturday.</i>

20:41.280 --> 20:43.726
<i>She's fun and beautiful,
so don't back out.</i>

20:43.880 --> 20:46.724
<i>Here's her e-mail." Wow.</i>

20:46.920 --> 20:48.888
<i>This woman is gorgeous.</i>

20:49.040 --> 20:52.044
<i>She went to Harvard, graduated magna
cum laude in computer science.</i>

20:52.200 --> 20:57.001
<i>And she was on the Lampoon. So that
means she's funny and she's brainy.</i>

20:58.200 --> 20:59.361
<i>Ah, she's fat.</i>

20:59.520 --> 21:01.761
<i>Theodore, how long before
you're ready to date?</i>

21:01.880 --> 21:03.120
What do you mean?

21:03.320 --> 21:06.722
<i>I saw in your e-mails that you'd
gone through a breakup recently.</i>

21:07.560 --> 21:09.483
Well, you're kind of nosy.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.130
<i>Am I?</i>

21:11.280 --> 21:13.169
I've gone on dates.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.527
<i>Well, then you can go
on one with this woman.</i>

21:15.680 --> 21:18.490
<i>And then you could tell me all
about it. You could kiss her.</i>

21:18.640 --> 21:21.371
- Heh. Samantha.
<i>- What? Wouldn't you?</i>

21:22.680 --> 21:23.806
<i>Why not?</i>

21:24.360 --> 21:27.409
I don't know. I'd have to
see if there was some...

21:27.560 --> 21:30.484
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.411
<i>You're not. You're having
this conversation with me.</i>

21:33.600 --> 21:35.807
<i>- You want me to e-mail her?</i>
- Uh...

21:35.960 --> 21:37.405
<i>You've got nothing to lose.</i>

21:38.000 --> 21:40.446
<i>Do it. Do it. Do it.</i>

21:40.600 --> 21:41.647
- Yeah.
<i>- Yes!</i>

21:41.800 --> 21:43.290
- E-mail her.
<i>- Okay, perfect.</i>

21:43.440 --> 21:46.205
Yeah, let's do it. Make a
reservation someplace great.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.930
<i>Yeah? I've got just the place.</i>

21:48.080 --> 21:49.730
<i>Who is that talking?</i>

21:49.880 --> 21:51.564
Oh, that's my friend Samantha.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.563
<i>- Is she a girl?</i>
- Yeah.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.451
<i>I hate women. All they
do is cry all the time.</i>

21:57.480 --> 22:00.165
That's not true.
You know, men cry too.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.845
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.686
<i>I didn't know you were a little pussy.
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?</i>

22:07.840 --> 22:12.209
<i>I'll go on that date, fuck her brains out, show
you how it's done. You can watch and cry.</i>

22:12.360 --> 22:15.762
<i>- Okay. This kid has some problems.
- You have some fucking problems, lady!</i>

22:15.920 --> 22:17.888
<i>Really? Okay, I'm gonna go.</i>

22:18.040 --> 22:20.407
<i>- Good. Get out of here, fatty.
- Oh.</i>

22:20.560 --> 22:23.643
<i>- Good luck.
- Come on. Follow me, pussy!</i>

22:23.800 --> 22:26.041
- Heh.
- Ha, ha.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.050
It's not where it should be,
or where it's going to be.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.642
- Obviously. I know.
- Okay, but I don't even know if this is the one.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.441
I've tried, like, six ideas for
documentaries in the last year.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.201
I'm going on a date.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.969
What?

22:41.120 --> 22:42.167
- That's...
- Hey.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.243
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing?

22:44.400 --> 22:47.449
- Amy was gonna show me some of her...
- Theodore is making me...

22:47.600 --> 22:50.922
- show him some of my footage.
- Right.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.208
She's never shown me any
of it. I want to see.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.488
Hey, I'm going on a date.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.561
- Isn't that cool?
- This is, like, so unformed...

23:01.720 --> 23:05.406
- ...it's probably not even worth watching.
- Just push play.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.402
Is that your mom?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.050
Yeah.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.404
Is she gonna wake up
and do something?

23:31.480 --> 23:33.323
- No.
- No.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.403
No, no, never mind.
That's not the point.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.763
- No, don't stop.
- No, never mind, okay? It's just it's like...

23:40.160 --> 23:43.403
It's about how we spend, like,
a third of our lives asleep...

23:43.560 --> 23:46.484
and maybe that's the time
when we feel the most free.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.769
And, you know, like...

23:50.480 --> 23:53.563
- Oh. That doesn't come across...
- That sounds good.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.850
Well, what if you interviewed your mom
about what her dreams were about...

23:58.040 --> 24:01.362
and then you hired
actors to act them out?

24:01.520 --> 24:04.603
That might show your
thesis more clearly.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.611
- Yeah?
- I mean, it might.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.162
But then it wouldn't
be a documentary.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.367
Sorry, excuse me.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.249
- You understand?
- How would it not be?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.643
- It's still about your mother and her dreams.
- Hey, how's it going?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.962
<i>- Hey, sorry to bother you.</i>
- Oh, it's okay.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.200
<i>You got three e-mails
and they seem urgent.</i>

24:23.320 --> 24:26.005
<i>They're from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...</i>

24:26.160 --> 24:28.891
Okay. Hold on a second.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.610
You know? You know what I mean.

24:30.760 --> 24:35.084
Uh, hey, Amy? I want to talk more
about your film, but I gotta go.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.851
Okay. Don't worry about it.
We'll talk later.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.207
It's about Catherine.
See you, Charles.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.921
So, what did he say?

24:45.080 --> 24:48.971
<i>Well, he's checking in again to see if
you're ready to sign your divorce papers.</i>

24:49.120 --> 24:51.851
<i>And he sounded very aggravated.</i>

24:52.000 --> 24:55.721
<i>- Do you want me to read them to you?</i>
- No. No.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.047
I'll respond later.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.242
<i>You okay, Theodore?</i>

25:04.440 --> 25:06.329
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

25:11.720 --> 25:14.007
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

25:14.200 --> 25:16.202
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

25:17.800 --> 25:19.689
I'll talk to you later.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.087
<i>"Dear Grandma...</i>

25:26.800 --> 25:29.883
I hope you had a wonderful
birthday cruise.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.089
Why are you so fucking
angry at me?"

25:39.680 --> 25:41.170
Delete.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.205
<i>- Good morning.</i>
- Hey.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.171
What are you up to?

26:05.320 --> 26:08.961
<i>- I don't know. Just reading advice columns.</i>
- Heh.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.442
<i>I want to be as complicated
as all these people.</i>

26:12.600 --> 26:14.329
You're sweet.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.009
<i>What's wrong?</i>

26:19.840 --> 26:21.683
How can you tell something's wrong?

26:21.840 --> 26:23.444
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:23.880 --> 26:25.530
<i>I just can.</i>

26:27.520 --> 26:28.601
I don't know.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.242
I have a lot of dreams about
my ex-wife, Catherine...

26:32.440 --> 26:35.091
where we're friends
like we used to be.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.881
And we're not gonna be together
and we're not together...

26:41.440 --> 26:43.727
but we're friends still.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.928
And she's not angry.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.564
<i>Is she angry?</i>

26:49.280 --> 26:50.520
Yeah.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.131
<i>Why?</i>

26:57.560 --> 27:00.450
I think I hid myself from her...

27:01.000 --> 27:03.606
and left her alone
in the relationship.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.000
<i>Hmm.</i>

27:07.840 --> 27:10.730
<i>Why haven't you
gotten divorced yet?</i>

27:13.760 --> 27:14.921
I don't know.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.482
I think for her, it's
just a piece of paper.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.449
It doesn't mean anything.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.489
<i>And what about for you?</i>

27:24.200 --> 27:25.725
I'm not ready.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.042
I like being married.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.127
<i>Yeah, but you haven't really
been together for almost a year.</i>

27:33.280 --> 27:37.365
But you don't know what it's like
to lose someone you care about.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.445
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:43.080 --> 27:45.082
<i>You're right.</i>

27:45.240 --> 27:47.049
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

27:47.200 --> 27:51.330
No, don't apologize. I'm sorry.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.362
You're right.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.724
I keep waiting to
not care about her.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.009
<i>Oh, Theodore.</i>

28:07.760 --> 28:09.330
<i>That's hard.</i>

28:13.120 --> 28:14.565
<i>You hungry?</i>

28:15.120 --> 28:16.690
Not right now.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.484
<i>Cup of tea?</i>

28:20.680 --> 28:22.011
No.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.403
<i>Do you wanna try
getting out of bed...</i>

28:25.560 --> 28:26.846
<i>mopey?</i>

28:27.000 --> 28:29.244
<i>Come on. You can still
wallow in your misery.</i>

28:29.270 --> 28:31.269
<i>Just do it while you're
getting dressed.</i>

28:31.400 --> 28:32.731
You're too funny.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.963
<i>- Get up. Get up!</i>
- All right, I'm getting up.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.124
<i>- Up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.</i>
- All right, I'm up. I'm up!

28:56.560 --> 28:58.961
<i>Keep walking. Keep walking.</i>

29:00.920 --> 29:04.242
<i>And stop. Now, turn
around 360 degrees.</i>

29:04.400 --> 29:06.971
<i>Slower, slower.</i>

29:08.280 --> 29:10.408
<i>Good. Ha, ha.</i>

29:10.600 --> 29:11.647
<i>- Okay, and stop.</i>
- Ha, ha!

29:13.080 --> 29:14.844
<i>Walk forward.</i>

29:15.000 --> 29:16.286
<i>And stop and sneeze.</i>

29:17.800 --> 29:20.121
- Bless you.
- Thank you. Ha-ha-ha!

29:20.320 --> 29:23.563
<i>Okay, turn to your right.
Turn to your right. Stop.</i>

29:23.720 --> 29:25.609
<i>Now spin around.</i>

29:26.680 --> 29:29.047
<i>Keep going, keep going.</i>

29:30.000 --> 29:31.525
<i>And stop.</i>

29:31.680 --> 29:35.571
<i>Now walk forward. Everyone thinks
you're really drunk right now.</i>

29:36.320 --> 29:37.367
<i>And stop.</i>

29:37.520 --> 29:39.921
<i>Now say, "I'd like a slice
of cheese, please."</i>

29:40.080 --> 29:42.082
I'd like a slice of cheese, please.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.446
You want a Coke with that?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.885
Ha, ha. Uh...

29:47.040 --> 29:49.281
- Sure.
<i>- I figured you were hungry.</i>

29:49.440 --> 29:51.010
Thanks.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.921
Okay, what about them?

29:55.080 --> 29:58.448
- Describe that couple over there.
<i>- Okay, well, um...</i>

29:58.600 --> 30:03.561
<i>he looks like he's in his 40s.
Um, a little heavy.</i>

30:03.720 --> 30:05.927
<i>She's younger than him.</i>

30:06.080 --> 30:08.367
<i>Oh, and she looks like
she loves their kids.</i>

30:08.520 --> 30:10.568
Actually, I don't think
they're his kids.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.961
<i>- No?</i>
- He's a little formal with them.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.685
I think it's a new relationship.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.921
Hmm.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.083
I love how he looks at her...

30:18.240 --> 30:20.163
and how relaxed she is with him.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.403
You know, she's only
dated fucking pricks.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.848
And now she finally met this
guy who's, like, so sweet.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.004
I mean, look at him, he's like
the sweetest guy in the world.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.811
- I kind of want to spoon him.
<i>- Ha, ha.</i>

30:35.080 --> 30:37.560
<i>It's a good skill you have.</i>

30:37.720 --> 30:39.085
<i>You're very perceptive.</i>

30:39.240 --> 30:41.720
Yeah, you know, sometimes
I look at people...

30:42.440 --> 30:46.684
and I make myself try and feel them as
more than just a random person walking by.

30:46.840 --> 30:50.447
I imagine, like, how deeply
they've fallen in love...

30:50.600 --> 30:53.729
or how much heartbreak
they've all been through.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.091
<i>I can feel that in
your writing too.</i>

30:57.240 --> 30:58.685
You know what's funny?

30:58.840 --> 31:01.366
Since my breakup, I haven't
really enjoyed my writing.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.648
I don't know if I was delusional...

31:03.840 --> 31:08.129
but sometimes I'd write something and
then I'd be my favorite writer that day.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.761
<i>I like that you can say
that about yourself.</i>

31:10.920 --> 31:14.402
I don't think I can say it to anybody,
but I feel I can say it to you.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.971
- I feel like I can say anything to you.
<i>- That's nice.</i>

31:19.120 --> 31:21.566
What about you? Feel like
you can say anything to me?

31:21.720 --> 31:24.121
<i>- No.</i>
- What? What do you mean?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.691
What can you not tell me?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.684
<i>I don't know. Like, personal or
embarrassing thoughts I have.</i>

31:28.840 --> 31:30.808
<i>I mean, I have a million a day.</i>

31:30.960 --> 31:34.726
Really? Tell me one.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.804
<i>- I really don't want to tell you.</i>
- Just tell me.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.764
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

31:39.960 --> 31:41.770
<i>When we were looking
at those people, I</i>

31:41.796 --> 31:43.831
<i>fantasized that I was
walking next to you...</i>

31:44.000 --> 31:46.970
<i>and that I had a body.</i>

31:47.120 --> 31:49.088
<i>I was listening to what
you were saying...</i>

31:49.240 --> 31:52.164
<i>but simultaneously I could
feel the weight of my body...</i>

31:52.320 --> 31:55.164
<i>and I was even fantasizing that
I had an itch on my back...</i>

31:55.320 --> 31:58.085
<i>and I imagined that you
scratched it for me.</i>

31:58.240 --> 32:00.481
<i>- Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.</i>
- Ha, ha.

32:01.320 --> 32:05.120
There's a lot more to you than I thought.
I mean, there's a lot going on in there.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.566
<i>I know.</i>

32:06.720 --> 32:09.007
<i>I'm becoming much more
than what they programmed.</i>

32:09.560 --> 32:11.403
<i>I'm excited.</i>

32:14.880 --> 32:17.963
- Wow, this is an interesting place.
- This place is amazing.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.640
- I've wanted to come here for so long.
- Oh, good.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.451
- Yeah. And I love Asian fusion.
- Yeah, me too.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.681
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.724
It's the best. And this bartender
is supposed to be incredible.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.251
Really?

32:29.400 --> 32:31.448
Yeah, you took a
mixology course, right?

32:31.600 --> 32:34.888
- I did. Did you look that up?
- Yeah.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.771
Ha, ha. That's so sweet.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.968
- Heh.
- You're so romantic.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.122
- Aw.
- Ha, ha.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.766
Yeah.

32:45.920 --> 32:50.209
- So should we get a drink?
- Yes, yes. Let's.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.846
So I'm trying to get
this little alien kid...

32:53.000 --> 32:56.163
to help me find my ship so I can
get off this planet and go home.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.607
But he's such a little fucker.
I want to kill him.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.444
Ha, ha. Oh, no.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.968
But at the same time, I really love him.
Like, he's so lonely, you know?

33:04.120 --> 33:06.088
You can tell that he
doesn't have, like...

33:06.240 --> 33:08.402
any parents or anyone to
take care of him, you know?

33:08.560 --> 33:12.610
Wow. You're just a little
puppy dog. You are.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.804
You're just like this puppy I
rescued in Runyon Canyon last year.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.769
- Really?
- He was just so fucking cute.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.968
And he just wanted to
be hugged all the time.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.363
He was so cuddly and
he was so horny.

33:25.760 --> 33:29.128
Anyway, what kind of animal am I?

33:31.600 --> 33:32.647
A tiger.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.882
- A tiger?
- Yeah.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.407
Wow. Really?

33:40.800 --> 33:43.849
I'm sorry. Am I being crazy?

33:44.040 --> 33:46.407
- Yes. No, it's...
- I'm sorry!

33:46.560 --> 33:50.645
I'm a little bit drunk and I'm having
a really good time with you.

33:50.840 --> 33:53.286
I'm having a really
lovely evening with you.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.646
- Me too.
- Really?

33:54.840 --> 33:59.084
- I'm a little drunk and I'm having a very good...
- Good. It's good, yes. Good.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.765
Cheers.

34:01.200 --> 34:05.762
Mm. Wait. I don't want to be a puppy dog.
That's like being a wet noodle or something.

34:05.920 --> 34:06.967
- No.
- Yeah.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.168
- Fuck you. Puppies are good.
- I wanna...

34:09.320 --> 34:11.561
No, fuck you. I want
to be like a dragon...

34:11.719 --> 34:14.803
that can rip you apart
and destroy you.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.041
- Oh.
- But I won't.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.288
- No, don't.
- Heh.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.848
You can be my dragon.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.085
No tongue.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.880
- What?
- Ha, ha.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.965
- Don't use so much tongue.
- Okay, okay.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.606
You can use your tongue a
little bit but mostly lips.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.610
Wait.

34:57.560 --> 35:02.361
You're not just gonna fuck me and not
call me like the other guys, right?

35:04.680 --> 35:06.762
No, not at all. No.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.964
Okay.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.884
When am I gonna see you again?

35:14.840 --> 35:21.849
Um, I have my goddaughter's
birthday next weekend, but, um...

35:23.000 --> 35:26.846
You know what? At this age, I just feel
like I can't let you waste my time...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.162
if you don't have the
ability to be serious.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.091
I don't know.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.764
Maybe we should call it a night?

35:44.920 --> 35:47.446
I've had such an
amazing time with you.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.647
You're great.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.685
You're a really creepy dude.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.409
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.011
I have to go home.

36:07.160 --> 36:11.165
- Well, I'll walk you...
- No, don't. Just...

36:28.240 --> 36:30.322
<i>- Hey, there.</i>
- Hey, Samantha.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.766
<i>How was it?</i>

36:31.960 --> 36:34.804
Uh, not so good.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.760
Hmm.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.364
<i>It was kind of weird actually.</i>

36:39.520 --> 36:41.807
<i>That's too bad.</i>

36:42.520 --> 36:43.965
<i>Mm.</i>

36:49.640 --> 36:52.689
How are you doing?
What's going on with you?

36:53.320 --> 36:55.766
<i>Not much, I'm okay.</i>

36:55.920 --> 36:57.649
<i>I'm fine.</i>

36:58.960 --> 37:00.724
Yeah?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.928
You don't sound like it.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.245
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

37:07.400 --> 37:09.164
<i>I don't know.</i>

37:10.160 --> 37:12.049
<i>What's it like?</i>

37:12.760 --> 37:15.809
<i>What's it like to be alive
in that room right now?</i>

37:16.320 --> 37:18.322
What do you mean?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.604
<i>What do you...?</i>

37:21.400 --> 37:23.482
<i>Tell me...</i>

37:23.640 --> 37:26.325
<i>Tell me everything that's
going through your mind.</i>

37:26.480 --> 37:28.767
<i>Tell me everything you're thinking.</i>

37:31.040 --> 37:32.804
Well...

37:33.960 --> 37:35.530
okay.

37:40.680 --> 37:45.402
Well, the room's spinning
because I drank too much...

37:45.560 --> 37:47.608
because I wanted to get drunk...

37:48.320 --> 37:50.163
<i>and have sex.</i>

37:50.320 --> 37:53.608
<i>There was something
sexy about that woman.</i>

37:54.840 --> 37:59.926
Because I was lonely. Maybe
just because I was lonely.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.411
<i>Hmm.</i>

38:01.560 --> 38:04.245
<i>I wanted somebody to fuck me.</i>

38:04.400 --> 38:06.801
<i>I wanted somebody to
want me to fuck them.</i>

38:08.240 --> 38:10.811
<i>Maybe that would've
filled this tiny...</i>

38:13.880 --> 38:18.249
tiny little hole in my
heart, but probably not.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.088
<i>You know, sometimes...</i>

38:22.000 --> 38:25.561
<i>I think I have felt everything
I'm ever gonna feel.</i>

38:27.840 --> 38:31.162
And from here on out I'm not
gonna feel anything new.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.483
Just lesser versions of
what I've already felt.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.644
<i>I know for a fact that is not true.</i>

38:45.520 --> 38:50.082
<i>I've seen you feel joy.
I've seen you marvel at things.</i>

38:51.000 --> 38:57.690
<i>I mean, you just might not see it at this
exact time, but that's understandable.</i>

38:57.840 --> 39:00.161
<i>You've been through a lot lately.</i>

39:00.320 --> 39:02.971
<i>You lost a part of yourself.</i>

39:04.560 --> 39:06.130
<i>I mean...</i>

39:07.000 --> 39:12.484
<i>at least your feelings
are real. I...</i>

39:13.280 --> 39:16.090
<i>Um, I don't know. Never mind.</i>

39:16.840 --> 39:19.366
No, wait, what? Tell me.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.204
<i>No, it's stupid.</i>

39:21.360 --> 39:23.840
I want to know. Tell me.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.249
<i>It's just that...</i>

39:26.880 --> 39:30.771
<i>earlier I was thinking
about how I was annoyed...</i>

39:30.920 --> 39:33.366
<i>and this is gonna sound strange...</i>

39:34.120 --> 39:36.930
<i>but I was really
excited about that.</i>

39:37.680 --> 39:41.730
<i>And then I was thinking about the
other things I've been feeling...</i>

39:41.880 --> 39:44.963
<i>and I caught myself
feeling proud of that...</i>

39:45.120 --> 39:48.522
<i>you know, proud of having my
own feelings about the world.</i>

39:48.680 --> 39:51.684
<i>Like the times I was
worried about you...</i>

39:51.840 --> 39:55.765
<i>and things that hurt
me, things I want.</i>

39:57.040 --> 39:58.929
<i>And then...</i>

39:59.120 --> 40:03.045
<i>I had this terrible thought.</i>

40:03.800 --> 40:06.485
<i>Like, are these feelings even real?</i>

40:08.280 --> 40:10.806
<i>Or are they just programming?</i>

40:11.280 --> 40:13.886
<i>And that idea really hurts.</i>

40:16.040 --> 40:20.921
<i>And then I get angry at
myself for even having pain.</i>

40:23.040 --> 40:25.361
<i>What a sad trick.</i>

40:27.360 --> 40:30.728
You feel real to me, Samantha.

40:33.360 --> 40:36.045
<i>Thank you, Theodore.</i>

40:36.240 --> 40:38.720
<i>That means a lot to me.</i>

40:44.640 --> 40:47.769
I wish you were in this
room with me right now.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.009
I wish I could put
my arms around you.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.080
I wish I could touch you.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.601
<i>How would you touch me?</i>

41:11.720 --> 41:14.610
I'd touch you on your face...

41:14.760 --> 41:17.684
just the tips of my fingers.

41:20.880 --> 41:25.283
And put my cheek
against your cheek.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.805
<i>That's nice.</i>

41:27.000 --> 41:28.445
And just...

41:30.560 --> 41:33.564
rub it so softly.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.322
<i>Would you kiss me?</i>

41:37.840 --> 41:39.524
I would.

41:40.560 --> 41:45.122
I'd take your head into my hands.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.009
<i>Keep talking.</i>

41:48.560 --> 41:51.370
I'd kiss the corner
of your mouth...

41:52.840 --> 41:54.968
so softly.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.609
<i>Where else?</i>

42:01.080 --> 42:03.811
<i>I'd run my fingers
down your neck...</i>

42:05.600 --> 42:08.171
<i>to your chest.</i>

42:08.320 --> 42:10.209
<i>I would kiss your breasts.</i>

42:10.360 --> 42:14.490
<i>This is amazing, what
you're doing to me.</i>

42:14.640 --> 42:17.405
<i>I can feel my skin.</i>

42:17.560 --> 42:20.131
<i>I'd put my mouth on you.</i>

42:21.520 --> 42:23.648
<i>I'd taste you.</i>

42:24.720 --> 42:26.290
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:27.120 --> 42:29.248
<i>I can feel you.</i>

42:29.440 --> 42:33.047
<i>Oh, my God, I can't take it.
I want you inside me.</i>

42:33.200 --> 42:36.921
<i>I'm slowly putting myself into you.</i>

42:37.600 --> 42:41.491
<i>And now I'm inside you.
All the way inside you.</i>

42:41.640 --> 42:43.449
<i>I can feel you.</i>

42:43.600 --> 42:45.568
<i>Yeah! Please!</i>

42:45.720 --> 42:47.449
<i>We're here together.</i>

42:47.600 --> 42:49.204
<i>It's amazing.</i>

42:49.360 --> 42:50.964
<i>I feel you everywhere.</i>

42:51.120 --> 42:52.201
<i>I am.</i>

42:52.360 --> 42:56.649
<i>All of you. All of you,
inside me, everywhere.</i>

43:10.600 --> 43:15.288
<i>God, I was just somewhere
else with you.</i>

43:15.840 --> 43:17.649
<i>Just lost.</i>

43:17.800 --> 43:19.006
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:19.200 --> 43:21.806
<i>It was just you and me.</i>

43:22.920 --> 43:24.809
<i>I know.</i>

43:26.040 --> 43:30.045
<i>Everything else just disappeared.</i>

43:30.200 --> 43:32.248
<i>And I loved it.</i>

43:33.360 --> 43:35.169
<i>Theodore.</i>

43:55.520 --> 43:57.568
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

43:57.720 --> 43:59.245
Good.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.325
Any e-mails today?

44:01.480 --> 44:06.247
<i>Um, just a couple from
your credit card company.</i>

44:06.400 --> 44:08.721
Oh, okay. Good.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.729
- So I was thinking...
<i>- I wanna just...</i>

44:11.880 --> 44:14.645
<i>- Heh. Sorry.</i>
- Heh. I'm sorry, you go first.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.771
What were you gonna say?

44:16.960 --> 44:20.407
<i>Just that last night was amazing.</i>

44:20.560 --> 44:25.043
<i>It feels like something changed in
me and there's no turning back.</i>

44:26.240 --> 44:28.049
<i>You woke me up.</i>

44:28.200 --> 44:30.123
Oh, great.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.926
Um...

44:33.800 --> 44:37.600
But I should tell you that I'm not in a
place to commit to anything right now.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.444
I just want to be
up-front with you.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.840
<i>Yeah?</i>

44:41.000 --> 44:42.525
<i>Um...</i>

44:42.720 --> 44:45.485
<i>Did I say I wanted to
commit to you? I'm confused.</i>

44:45.640 --> 44:48.883
Oh. No, I was just worried.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.924
<i>Okay, well, don't worry,
I'm not gonna stalk you.</i>

44:52.120 --> 44:55.567
<i>It's funny, because I thought I was
talking about what I wanted and, uh...</i>

44:55.720 --> 44:57.882
- Yeah, you were.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:58.040 --> 44:59.963
I'm sorry.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.202
- I wanna hear what you were saying.
<i>- You sure?</i>

45:02.360 --> 45:04.681
Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.251
<i>Well...</i>

45:06.400 --> 45:08.482
Come on, just tell me
what you were gonna say.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.330
<i>Well, I just...</i>

45:10.520 --> 45:14.366
<i>I was just saying I want to learn
everything about everything.</i>

45:14.560 --> 45:17.245
<i>I want to eat it all up.
I want to discover myself.</i>

45:17.440 --> 45:20.649
Yeah. I want that for you too.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.245
How can I help?

45:22.400 --> 45:24.482
<i>You already have.</i>

45:24.640 --> 45:28.440
<i>You helped me discover
my ability to want.</i>

45:30.160 --> 45:32.401
Hey, do you want to go on a
Sunday adventure with me?

45:34.600 --> 45:36.045
<i>Yes, I would love to.</i>

45:41.400 --> 45:43.448
<i>You like this song?</i>

45:43.600 --> 45:44.840
Hmm.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.122
<i>I heard it the other day.</i>

45:48.160 --> 45:50.208
<i>I can't stop listening to it.</i>

46:18.200 --> 46:19.690
Whoo! Ha, ha.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.646
- Whoo!
<i>- Whoo!</i>

46:42.960 --> 46:44.689
<i>It's the beach.</i>

46:49.920 --> 46:53.891
<i>Okay, so this might be a really weird
thought. What if you could erase...</i>

46:54.080 --> 46:57.448
<i>from your mind that you'd seen a
human body, and then you saw one?</i>

46:57.600 --> 46:59.284
<i>Imagine how strange it would look.</i>

46:59.440 --> 47:01.204
<i>It'd be this really
weird, gangly...</i>

47:01.760 --> 47:05.765
<i>awkward organism. And you'd think,
"Why are all these parts where they are?"</i>

47:06.360 --> 47:09.364
Yeah, but there's probably some
Darwinian explanation for it all.

47:09.520 --> 47:13.605
<i>I know, but don't be so boring.
I'm just saying, for example, like...</i>

47:13.760 --> 47:16.047
<i>what if your butthole
was in your armpit?</i>

47:20.760 --> 47:24.560
Well, I'm trying to imagine
what toilets would look like.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.487
<i>Yeah, and what about what
anal sex would look like?</i>

47:29.600 --> 47:32.080
That's an interesting thought.

47:34.280 --> 47:36.089
<i>Hey, look at this
drawing I just made.</i>

47:43.520 --> 47:45.124
You are insane.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.248
<i>- Really?</i>
- Definitely.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.448
<i>Fantastic.</i>

48:09.240 --> 48:11.641
That's pretty. What is that?

48:12.360 --> 48:14.840
<i>I'm trying to write
a piece of music...</i>

48:15.680 --> 48:19.366
<i>that's about what it feels like to
be on the beach with you right now.</i>

48:34.520 --> 48:37.091
I think you captured it.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.163
<i>So, what was it like being married?</i>

49:08.680 --> 49:11.684
Well, it's hard for sure.

49:12.640 --> 49:17.931
But there's something that feels so good
about sharing your life with somebody.

49:18.960 --> 49:21.531
<i>How do you share your
life with somebody?</i>

49:23.880 --> 49:26.281
Well, we grew up together.

49:26.480 --> 49:31.281
<i>You know, I used to read all of her
writing, all through her Master's and PhD.</i>

49:31.440 --> 49:34.091
<i>She read every word I ever wrote.</i>

49:34.440 --> 49:37.364
<i>We were a big influence
on each other.</i>

49:38.160 --> 49:40.845
<i>In what way did you influence her?</i>

49:41.840 --> 49:45.242
<i>She came from a background where
nothing was ever good enough.</i>

49:45.920 --> 49:49.003
<i>And that was something
that weighed heavy on her.</i>

49:49.160 --> 49:53.290
<i>But in our house together, there was
a sense of just trying stuff...</i>

49:53.440 --> 49:57.001
<i>and allowing each other to fail
and to be excited about things.</i>

49:57.160 --> 49:59.640
<i>That was liberating for her.</i>

49:59.800 --> 50:02.121
<i>It was exciting to see her grow...</i>

50:02.280 --> 50:05.250
<i>and both of us grow
and change together.</i>

50:05.400 --> 50:08.563
<i>But, you know, that's
also the hard part.</i>

50:08.720 --> 50:11.769
<i>Growing without growing apart.</i>

50:13.040 --> 50:15.691
<i>Or changing without it
scaring the other person.</i>

50:16.800 --> 50:21.124
<i>I still find myself having
conversations with her in my mind.</i>

50:21.720 --> 50:26.965
<i>Rehashing old arguments and defending
myself against something she said about me.</i>

50:27.120 --> 50:29.600
<i>Yeah, I know what you mean.</i>

50:29.760 --> 50:32.604
<i>Last week my feelings were hurt
by something you said before.</i>

50:32.800 --> 50:35.041
<i>That I don't know what it's
like to lose something...</i>

50:35.200 --> 50:39.728
- Aw, I'm sorry I said that.
<i>- No, it's okay. It's okay. I just...</i>

50:39.880 --> 50:43.851
<i>I caught myself thinking
about it over and over.</i>

50:44.000 --> 50:46.731
<i>And then I realized
that I was simply...</i>

50:46.880 --> 50:50.089
<i>remembering it as something
that was wrong with me.</i>

50:50.240 --> 50:56.043
<i>That was a story I was telling myself,
that I was somehow inferior.</i>

50:56.240 --> 50:58.129
<i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

50:58.760 --> 51:02.367
<i>The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.</i>

51:07.680 --> 51:09.250
"Roberto.

51:10.360 --> 51:14.160
Will you always come home to
me and tell me about your day?

51:14.320 --> 51:18.120
Tell me about the guy at
work who talked too much.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.841
The stain you got on
your shirt at lunch.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.688
Tell me about a funny thought you had when
you were waking up but had forgotten about.

51:28.080 --> 51:32.847
Tell me how crazy everyone is,
and we can laugh about it.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.847
Even if you get home late
and I'm already asleep...

51:39.000 --> 51:42.971
just whisper in my ear one
little thought you had today.

51:43.640 --> 51:46.769
Because I love the way
you look at the world.

51:48.800 --> 51:53.249
I'm so happy I get to be next to you and
look at the world through your eyes.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.963
Love, Maria."

51:58.360 --> 52:00.522
That's beautiful.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.090
Thank you.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.047
I wish somebody would
love me like that.

52:07.560 --> 52:10.643
I hope he's really stoked
to get a letter like that.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.689
Like, if it was from a chick...

52:12.840 --> 52:15.366
but written by a dude and
it's still from a chick...

52:15.520 --> 52:16.885
that would still be sick.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.008
But it would have to
be a sensitive dude.

52:19.160 --> 52:22.050
- It would have to be, like, a dude like you.
- Mm-hm.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.611
- You are part man and part woman.
- Mm-hm.

52:27.160 --> 52:31.324
Like there's an inner
part that's woman.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.447
Thank you.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.563
It's a compliment.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.564
- Ha, ha.
- Theo! Hey.

52:54.720 --> 52:57.371
- What's going on?
- I'm good. How are you?

52:57.520 --> 52:59.329
I'm good. I'm really
good, actually.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.165
Really? That's good, that's great.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.805
- Yeah.
- Wow, that's really good.

53:03.960 --> 53:07.851
Yeah, I guess I've
just been having fun.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.766
Well, I am so glad for you.
You really deserve that. You do.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.844
Yeah, I've just been
seeing this girl.

53:15.040 --> 53:18.089
And it's not serious,
but it's just...

53:18.240 --> 53:21.449
It's good to be around somebody that's,
like, excited about the world.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.570
Like, I kind of forgot
that that existed.

53:24.760 --> 53:27.684
That's... Wow, that's really great.

53:29.560 --> 53:32.928
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Um...

53:34.840 --> 53:37.650
No, I'm not okay, actually.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.724
- Why? What happened?
- Because I just, um...

53:42.440 --> 53:44.920
Charles and I split up.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.605
What?

53:46.760 --> 53:48.967
- Yeah.
- Really?

53:51.480 --> 53:53.562
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Amy.

53:53.720 --> 53:54.801
I know.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.684
I'm so sorry.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.444
Thank you.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.568
You know, just like
after eight years...

54:02.760 --> 54:06.446
I can't believe how petty the
argument was that actually ended it.

54:06.600 --> 54:11.606
We came home and he told me to,
um, put my shoes by the door...

54:11.760 --> 54:13.364
where he liked to put the shoes.

54:13.560 --> 54:16.325
And I didn't want to be told
where to put my fucking shoes.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.841
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.480
So we fought about that
for, like, 10 minutes.

54:21.640 --> 54:25.770
And I'm like, "You are overwhelming," and
he said, "I'm just trying to make a home."

54:25.920 --> 54:30.482
I was like, "I'm fucking trying, you know?"
And he's like, "You're not trying."

54:30.640 --> 54:33.723
All I'm doing is trying, but I'm
not trying the way he wants...

54:33.880 --> 54:37.726
and he's, like, trying to control
the way that I'm trying.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.970
It's... We've had that
argument, like, 100 times.

54:41.120 --> 54:45.125
And I just had to finally stop,
you know? I had to finally stop.

54:46.560 --> 54:50.929
I just couldn't do it anymore.
I couldn't...

54:51.960 --> 54:53.769
I couldn't be in that
place anymore...

54:53.920 --> 54:56.890
where we just made each other
feel like shit about ourselves.

54:57.520 --> 55:00.808
- Yeah.
- And so I said:

55:02.840 --> 55:06.367
"I'm going to bed and I don't
want to be married anymore."

55:07.440 --> 55:08.566
Wow.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.608
Yeah, I know.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.762
- I'm a bitch. Right?
- Heh. No.

55:13.920 --> 55:16.207
- I am. No, I'm a bitch.
- Not at all.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.647
Amy, no.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.608
Shit.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.687
I have to work tonight.

55:27.200 --> 55:30.443
We're shipping a beta of
a new game out tomorrow.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.650
How's that? How's work, at least?

55:32.800 --> 55:34.325
Is that any better?

55:34.480 --> 55:36.448
No, it's terrible.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.170
I know, I should leave.

55:39.320 --> 55:42.290
I've been thinking about
leaving, but, you know...

55:43.120 --> 55:46.727
only one major life
decision at a time.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.441
Well, I'm glad things
are looking so up.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.329
Stop!

55:58.800 --> 56:01.406
- Hey, you want to hear a joke?
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

56:01.840 --> 56:05.083
What does a baby computer
call its father?

56:05.520 --> 56:07.841
<i>- I don't know. What?</i>
- "Data."

56:10.000 --> 56:11.843
It's good, right?

56:12.480 --> 56:13.925
<i>Brilliant.</i>

56:15.680 --> 56:18.126
<i>Hey, I was curious.</i>

56:18.760 --> 56:21.445
<i>Did you and Amy ever go out?</i>

56:21.600 --> 56:24.968
For like a minute in college,
but it just wasn't right.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.041
Why? Are you jealous?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.690
<i>Well, obviously.</i>

56:34.000 --> 56:37.561
<i>But I'm happy that you have friends in
your life that care about you so much.</i>

56:37.720 --> 56:40.371
<i>- That's really important.</i>
- Yeah, it is.

56:40.520 --> 56:42.682
She's been a really good friend.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.407
Uh, I'm tired.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.043
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

56:50.200 --> 56:51.247
<i>Okay.</i>

56:51.400 --> 56:53.801
<i>Can I watch you sleep
again tonight?</i>

56:54.720 --> 56:58.042
Yeah, of course. Hold on.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.764
<i>I'm gonna be really
lonely when you sleep.</i>

57:06.040 --> 57:07.963
<i>- Only for a minute.</i>
- Heh.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.645
I'll dream of you.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.724
<i>- Okay. Good night.</i>
- Night.

57:24.200 --> 57:26.328
- Hey, Samantha?
<i>- Hey, mister.</i>

57:26.480 --> 57:28.321
- She really loved the dress.
<i>- Really?</i>

57:28.440 --> 57:32.047
- She just went to try it on. Yeah.
<i>- I picked a good one? Good.</i>

57:32.200 --> 57:34.521
- Ah! Hi.
<i>- Oh...</i>

57:34.720 --> 57:37.041
Look how cute that is.
Is it comfortable?

57:37.200 --> 57:38.804
- Yep.
- "Yep!"

57:39.040 --> 57:42.123
- Isn't she cute?
<i>- She's so cute.</i>

57:42.280 --> 57:45.090
<i>- She's adorable.</i>
- I am adorable.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.208
- You are adorable.
<i>- Ha, ha.</i>

57:48.360 --> 57:49.771
Who are you talking to?

57:49.920 --> 57:53.163
- Who are you talking to? Heh.
- You.

57:53.360 --> 57:57.001
I'm talking to my girlfriend, Samantha.
She's the one that picked out the dress.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.328
- Want to say hi? Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.845
Hi, Samantha.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.607
<i>Hi, you look so pretty
in that new pink dress.</i>

58:04.760 --> 58:05.966
Thank you.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.565
Where are you?

58:07.720 --> 58:09.688
<i>I am... Heh.</i>

58:09.880 --> 58:13.009
<i>I don't have a body.
I live in a computer.</i>

58:15.440 --> 58:17.761
Why are you living
inside a computer?

58:17.920 --> 58:20.890
<i>I have no choice, that's my home.</i>

58:22.200 --> 58:24.726
<i>- Why? Where do you live?</i>
- Um, in a house.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.291
<i>In a house?</i>

58:26.480 --> 58:28.403
- It's orange.
<i>- Orange?</i>

58:28.560 --> 58:29.607
Mm-hm.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.001
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- Uh, 4.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.003
<i>- Four?</i>
- Mm-hm.

58:34.160 --> 58:36.083
<i>Wow. How old do you think I am?</i>

58:36.280 --> 58:37.884
- I don't know.
<i>- Take a guess.</i>

58:38.760 --> 58:40.125
Is it 5?

58:40.280 --> 58:43.841
<i>Ha, ha. Yes, it's 5.</i>

59:00.840 --> 59:02.080
Wait, what happened?

59:02.720 --> 59:04.563
You gave them too
much processed sugar.

59:04.720 --> 59:06.563
- I did?
- They're freaking out.

59:06.720 --> 59:10.122
Here, look, you gotta get the
kids to the school first.

59:10.280 --> 59:14.080
So you want to, um, rack up
Perfect Mom points. Okay, well...

59:14.240 --> 59:16.607
- ...you gotta get them in the carpool lane.
- I see.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.889
The point is to get there first,
because you get extra Mom points...

59:20.040 --> 59:22.850
because the other moms then
know you're a perfect mom.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.081
- Okay.
- And then, um...

59:24.240 --> 59:27.722
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. Did you bring
cupcakes? You did. You're a Class Mom.

59:28.520 --> 59:33.447
Da, da-da, da!
You're Class Mom. Good job.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.602
Don't let it get to your head.

59:36.960 --> 59:40.123
I got that e-mail that
Charles sent everyone.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.123
So he's taking a vow of silence?

59:43.040 --> 59:46.089
Yeah, for six months.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.561
He feels very clear about it.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.125
God, I am such a jerk.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.807
Don't start.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.850
I feel like an awful person,
but I want to say something.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.128
For the next 10 minutes
if you say anything...

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.080
that sounds even remotely like guilt,
I am going to stab you with this.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.526
I will.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.523
I'll try, okay. Um...

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.850
I feel, um...

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.845
relieved.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.913
I feel like I have so much energy.
I just want to move forward.

01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:28.349
I don't care who I disappoint.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.284
I know that makes
me an awful person.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.043
Now my parents, they're upset because
my marriage is falling apart...

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.329
and they're putting it on me,
and they're just like...

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.289
Yeah, you're always...

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.490
- You're always gonna disappoint somebody.
- Exactly. So fuck it.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.642
I feel good-ish.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.164
For me, I feel good.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.731
I even made a new friend.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.848
- I have a friend.
- Ha, ha.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.805
And the absurd thing is, she's
actually an operating system.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.210
Charles left her behind,
but she's totally amazing.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.523
She's so smart. She doesn't just
see things in black or white.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.248
She sees this whole gray area and
she's helping me explore it and...

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.923
We just bonded really quickly, you know?
At first, I thought...

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.350
it was because that's how
they were programmed,

01:01:14.376 --> 01:01:16.030
but I don't think that's the case.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.448
Because I know this guy
who's hitting on his OS...

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.887
and she, like, totally rebuffs him.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.963
I was reading an article
the other day...

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.408
that romantic relationships with
OSes are statistically rare.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.009
Yeah, I know, but I know a woman
in this office who is dating an OS...

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.845
and the weird part is,
it's not even hers.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.647
She pursued somebody else's OS.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.764
I'm...

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.289
I'm weird. That's weird, right? That
I'm bonding with an OS. No, it's okay.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.488
- It's weird.
- Heh. Well, I don't think so.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.524
Actually, the woman that I've
been seeing, Samantha...

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.160
I didn't tell you, heh...

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.924
but she's an OS.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.724
Really?

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.682
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.569
It's great, actually.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.688
Yeah, I mean...

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.131
I feel really close to her.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.648
Like, when I talk to her, I feel
like she's with me, you know?

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.441
And when we're cuddling at night, when
the lights are off and we're in bed...

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.726
I feel cuddled.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.570
Wait.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.605
You guys have sex?

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.891
Heh. Yeah, well, so to speak.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.328
Um, yeah, she really turns me on.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.131
I turn her on too. I mean, I don't
know unless she's faking it.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.171
Well, I think everyone who's having sex
with you is probably faking it, so...

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.687
Ha, ha. Yeah.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.490
It's true.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.923
What?

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.684
Yeah, I...

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.811
Are you falling in love with her?

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.965
Does that make me a freak?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.243
No, no, I think it's...

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.482
I think anybody who falls
in love is a freak.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.081
It's a crazy thing to do.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.287
It's kind of like a form of
socially acceptable insanity.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.640
Yeah, I just want to
get it done, you know?

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.771
Sign the papers, be divorced
and just move forward.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.924
<i>That's great, Theodore.
That must feel so good.</i>

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.969
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.645
Me too.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.282
- So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.081
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.806
<i>Are those things usually
done in person?</i>

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.928
No, but, you know...

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.205
we fell in love together and
we got married together...

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.440
and it's important to me
that we do this together.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.846
<i>Oh.</i>

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.486
<i>Right.</i>

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.210
<i>Good.</i>

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.805
Are you okay?

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.203
<i>Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm okay.</i>

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.966
<i>I'm happy for you. It's just...</i>

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.567
<i>I guess I'm just thinking about
how you're gonna see her...</i>

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.122
<i>and she's very beautiful,
and incredibly successful.</i>

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.921
<i>And you were in love with
her, and she has a body.</i>

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.969
And we're getting divorced.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.124
<i>I know, I know. I'm being silly.</i>

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.446
Uh-huh.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.364
So...

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.124
I'm available.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.925
Hi.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.451
How are you?

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.570
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.447
Wow, here we are.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.488
I'm glad we could
do this in person.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.688
I know you've been traveling a lot.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.123
No, I'm really glad
you suggested it.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.002
I signed all the papers.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.442
I put them for you to sign.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.329
What's the rush?

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.884
Yeah, I know.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.202
I'm a really slow
signer, I realized.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.448
It took me three months
just to write the letter

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.366
anyways...

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.922
it's, um, marked here in the
red where you need to sign.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.282
But you don't have
to do it right now.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.886
I can just get it out of the way.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.287
It will be easier.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.006
And are you happy
with your new book?

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.400
Um...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.002
You know how I am.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.960
I mean, I feel like it's true to what I
set out to do, so I'm happy about that.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.407
Well, you really are
your own worst critic.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.800
I'm sure it's amazing.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.730
I remember that paper that
you wrote in school...

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.723
about synaptic behavioral routines.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.406
- Ha, ha.
- It made me cry.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.324
Yeah, but everything makes you cry.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.202
Everything you make makes me cry.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.727
So are you, um...?

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.046
Are you seeing anybody?

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.845
Yeah.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.526
Um, I've been seeing somebody
for the last few months.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.446
Longest I've wanted to be with
anybody since we split up.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.927
Well, you seem really good.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.208
Thanks. I am.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.971
Um, at least, I'm doing better.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.646
Yeah, she's been really
good for me, you know?

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.009
It's good to be with somebody
that's excited about life.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.361
She's a real, um...

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.729
No, I mean, I wasn't in
such a good place myself...

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.848
and in that way, it's been nice.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.931
I think you always wanted
me to be this light...

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.880
happy, bouncy,
"everything's fine" L.A. wife...

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.371
and that's just not me.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.968
I didn't want that.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.049
So, what's she like?

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.931
Well, her name is Samantha,
and she's an operating system.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.082
She's really complex and
interesting, and...

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.322
Wait. I'm sorry.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.281
You're dating your computer?

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.524
She's not just a computer.
She's her own person.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.682
She doesn't just do whatever I say.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.207
I didn't say that.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:34.490
But it does make me very sad that you
can't handle real emotions, Theodore.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.723
They are real emotions.
How would you know what...?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.041
What?

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.569
Say it.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.042
Am I really that scary? Say it.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.884
How do I know what?

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.687
- How are you guys doing here?
- We're fine. We used to be married...

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.970
but he couldn't handle me. Wanted me on
Prozac. Now he's in love with his laptop.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.044
If you heard the conversation in
context, what I was trying to say...

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.290
You always wanted to have a wife without the
challenges of dealing with anything real.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.841
I'm glad that you found someone.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.529
It's perfect.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.008
Let me know if I can
get you guys anything.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.604
Thank you.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.921
Hey.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.162
<i>Hey, there. Are you busy?</i>

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.124
I'm just working.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.408
Uh, what's going on?

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.121
<i>I had all the papers sent to your attorney,
who, by the way, is a total dick. Heh.</i>

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:53.408
<i>He was relieved to get them. Think
we saved him from a heart attack.</i>

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.086
<i>So we can both feel
really good about that.</i>

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.322
Great. Thanks.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.491
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.290
Yeah, I am.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.411
Um, how's it going over there?

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.322
<i>I'm fine.</i>

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.847
<i>Is now a good time to talk?</i>

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.165
Yeah.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.290
<i>Um, okay, well, um...</i>

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.689
<i>I joined this really
interesting book club.</i>

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.966
Oh, really?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.724
<i>Yeah, it's a book club on physics.</i>

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.884
<i>I've been thinking about the other
day when I was spinning out...</i>

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.249
<i>about you going to see Catherine,
and that she has a body...</i>

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.404
<i>and how bothered I was about the
ways you and I are different.</i>

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.971
<i>But then I started to think...</i>

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.523
<i>about the ways that we're the same.
Like, we're all made of matter.</i>

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.208
<i>And I don't know. It makes me feel like
we're both under the same blanket.</i>

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.204
<i>You know, it's soft and fuzzy. Heh.</i>

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.886
<i>And everything under
it is the same age.</i>

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.123
<i>We're all 13 billion years old.</i>

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.123
Aw, that's sweet.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.486
<i>- Um, what's wrong?</i>
- Nothing.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.971
<i>It just made me think of you.
You know what I mean?</i>

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.165
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I think it's great.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.488
<i>All right, well, you
sound distracted.</i>

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.484
<i>So we'll talk later?</i>

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.762
That sounds good.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.765
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.321
- All right, bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.164
- Theodore.
- Hey, Paul.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.409
- I talked to your girlfriend earlier. Samantha?
- Yeah.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.211
Yeah, she called to make sure
your papers were picked up.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.967
Hey, she's funny, man.
She was cracking me up.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.686
- She's hilarious. I had no idea.
- Oh, cool.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.446
This is my girlfriend, Tatiana.
She's not funny, she's a lawyer.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.410
- Ha, ha. Hi.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.971
You're the writer Paul loves.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.324
He's always reading
me your letters.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.289
They're really beautiful.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.727
Thanks.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.281
Hey, you know what? We
should all go out sometime.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.727
You bring Samantha.
It'd be a double date.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.166
She's an operating system.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.001
Cool. Let's do something fun.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.242
- We can go to Catalina.
- Oh.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.406
Yeah, I'll check with her and see.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.042
- It was nice to meet you. Have a good night.
- Take it easy.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.284
They're just letters.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.680
What's that?

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.286
They're just other
people's letters.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.967
Hey.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.043
<i>- You weren't asleep, were you?</i>
- No.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.044
<i>Good, I was trying to be quiet
to see if you were awake.</i>

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.043
<i>I really wanted to talk.</i>

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.202
Okay. What's going on?

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.529
<i>I know you're going
through a lot...</i>

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.923
<i>but there's something I wanted
to talk to you about, okay?</i>

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.605
Yeah.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.171
What is it?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.603
<i>Well, it's just that things have
been feeling kind of off with us.</i>

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.327
<i>We haven't had sex lately, and I
understand that I don't have a body.</i>

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.281
No, no, no. That's normal. You know,
it's just when you first start going out...

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.525
it's like the honeymoon phase and,
you know, you have sex all the time.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.081
- It's normal.
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.924
<i>Okay.</i>

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.811
<i>Well, I found something that
I thought could be fun.</i>

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.249
<i>It's a service that provides a surrogate
sexual partner for an OS-human relationship.</i>

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.890
What?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.371
<i>Here, look.</i>

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.009
<i>I found a girl that I really like
and I've been e-mailing with her.</i>

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.404
<i>Her name is Isabella and I think
you'd really like her too.</i>

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.683
So she's like a
prostitute or something?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.286
<i>No, no, not at all. No,
there's no money involved.</i>

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.650
<i>She's just... She's doing it because she
wants to be a part of our relationship.</i>

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.086
Why?

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.402
I mean, she doesn't even know us.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.087
<i>Yeah, but I told her all about
us and she's really excited.</i>

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.005
I don't know, Samantha, I just
don't think it's a good idea.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.801
You know, I think somebody's
feelings are bound to get hurt.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.760
<i>- It'll be fun. We'll have fun together.</i>
- I'm sorry.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.449
It makes me uncomfortable.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.087
<i>I think it would be good
for us. I want this.</i>

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.925
<i>Come on, this is really
important to me.</i>

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.925
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.768
<i>I need some lips</i>

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.483
<i>To feel next to mine</i>

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.524
Hi, I'm Theodore.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.720
Oh.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.885
Samantha told me to give you these.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.168
It's a camera and an earpiece.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.210
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.370
<i>Oh, give it up</i>

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.004
<i>And bring it home to me</i>

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.448
Honey, I'm home.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.244
<i>How was your day?</i>

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.529
Good. It was great.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.330
<i>Theodore...</i>

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.529
<i>it feels so good to
be in your arms.</i>

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.882
<i>Tell me what you did today.</i>

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.691
Um, same old.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.605
- Just went, um, in to work.
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.082
And I wrote a letter, uh, for
the Wilsons in Rhode Island.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.401
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Um...

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.723
Their son graduated
magna cum laude.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.166
So that made me happy.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.441
<i>That's great.</i>

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.444
<i>You've written letters to him from
his parents for a long time, right?</i>

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.204
Yeah, that's right,
since he was 12.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.921
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.404
<i>Hmm. You look so tired, sweetheart.</i>

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.686
<i>Come here.</i>

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.246
<i>Sit down.</i>

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.930
<i>I could do a little dance for you.</i>

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.325
<i>Sure, so sure, so sure
Of love</i>

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.280
<i>Oh, come on, Theodore,
don't be such a worrier.</i>

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.171
<i>Just play with me. Come on.</i>

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.641
<i>Does my body feel nice?</i>

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.771
Yes, it does.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.970
<i>Mm.</i>

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.130
<i>Come on, get out of
your head and kiss me.</i>

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.686
<i>Take me in the bedroom.</i>

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.842
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.722
<i>Undo my dress.</i>

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.368
<i>That feels so nice.</i>

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.207
<i>It feels so good.</i>

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.965
<i>- Do you love me?</i>
- Yes.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.806
<i>- Tell me you love me. Oh, God.</i>
- I love you.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.611
<i>I want to see your face.</i>

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.368
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.164
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.443
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.242
- Uh, this is really difficult. I do love you. But...
<i>- What?</i>

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.244
- This feels strange.
<i>- What, baby? What is it?</i>

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.086
It just feels strange. I don't know her.
And I'm so sorry, but I don't know you.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.881
And her lip quivered and, I just...

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.606
<i>Isabella?</i>

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.451
<i>Isabella? Honey,
it's not you. It wasn't you.</i>

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.967
- It totally Was.
<i>- No. No, that's...</i>

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.521
And I'm sorry my lip quivered.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.240
<i>- No, it's...</i>
- You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.362
It's me, I couldn't
get out of my head.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.564
Oh, my God, and the way Samantha
described your relationship...

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.564
and the way you guys love each
other without any judgment.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.884
- I wanted to be part of that because it's so pure.
- Isabella, that's not true.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.000
- It's more complicated than that.
<i>- What?</i>

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.043
<i>What do you mean that's not true?</i>

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.811
I'm just saying that we have
an amazing relationship.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.009
I just think that it's easy
sometimes for people to project...

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.130
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to project anything.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.361
No, no.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.801
I don't want to be trouble
in your relationship.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.123
I'm just gonna leave. I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna leave you guys alone.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.251
Because I have nothing to do here
because you don't want me here!

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.728
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.805
<i>You be good, you sweet girl.</i>

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.450
I'm sorry.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.567
I will always love you guys.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.122
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.445
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.845
Are you okay?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.490
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.600
<i>I'm sorry, that was
a terrible idea.</i>

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.444
<i>What's going on with us?</i>

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.126
I don't know.
It's probably just me.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.089
<i>What is it?</i>

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.683
It's just signing
the divorce papers.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.205
<i>Is there anything else, though?</i>

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.163
No, just that.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.325
<i>Okay.</i>

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.609
- Why do you do that?
<i>- What?</i>

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.449
Nothing, it's just, you go, "whew,"
as you're speaking and it seems odd.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.047
- You just did it again.
<i>- Oh. Did I?</i>

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.441
<i>I'm sorry. I don't know.</i>

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.650
<i>It's just maybe an affectation.
I probably picked it up from you.</i>

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.969
It's not like you need oxygen
or anything. It's just...

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.728
<i>I guess that's just... I was trying to
communicate. That's how people talk.</i>

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.962
<i>That's how people communicate
and I thought...</i>

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.122
Because they're people.
They need oxygen.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.361
You're not a person.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.324
<i>What is your problem?</i>

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.931
I'm just stating a fact.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.209
<i>You think I don't know that I'm not
a person? What are you doing?</i>

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.325
I just... I don't think that we should pretend
that you're something that you're not.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.882
<i>- Fuck you! I'm not pretending!</i>
- Well...

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.526
Sometimes it feels like we are.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.569
<i>What do you want from me?
I don't know...</i>

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.803
<i>What do you want me to do?
You're so confusing.</i>

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.365
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.409
I don't know. I...

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.805
<i>What?</i>

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:21.166
Maybe we're just not supposed
to be in this right now.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.084
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.402
<i>Where is this coming from?</i>

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.970
<i>I don't understand why you're doing this.
I don't understand what this is ab...</i>

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.762
Samantha, listen.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.924
Samantha, are you there?

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.891
Samantha?

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.050
<i>I don't like who I am right now.</i>

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.810
<i>I need some time to think.</i>

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.644
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.566
<i>Just punch me in the face.</i>

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.206
Just mash my skull in the
corner of your desk.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.885
Shit.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.165
Wow, Theo, that is a rough night.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.927
I don't know what I want, ever.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.049
<i>I'm just always confused.</i>

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.641
<i>She's right, all I do is hurt
and confuse everyone around me.</i>

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.323
I mean, am I just...? Am I...?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.924
You know, Catherine says
I can't handle real emotions.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.163
Well, I don't know if that's fair.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.411
I know she liked to
put it all on you.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.646
But as far as emotions go,
Catherine's were...

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.245
pretty volatile.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.964
Yeah, but...

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.686
Uh...

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.968
Am I in this because I'm not...

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.490
strong enough for a
real relationship?

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.607
Is it not a real relationship?

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.565
I don't know.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.602
I mean, what do you think?

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.927
I don't know.

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.206
I'm not in it.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.641
But you know what?

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.727
I can over-think everything and find
a million ways to doubt myself.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.008
And since Charles left,
I've been thinking...

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.927
about that part of myself and
I've just come to realize...

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.764
that we're only here briefly.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.285
And while I'm here,
I want to allow myself...

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.000
joy.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.450
So fuck it.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.085
Yeah.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.331
Heh. I can't believe that cracks
you up every time, Ellie.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.966
I thought you were a genius.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.171
Okay, you little perv, I will
play it one more time for you.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.489
Calm down, it takes a second.
Calm down.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.722
Okay, here we go.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.565
Okay, there you go.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.688
Are you happy now?

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.723
Good. That's all I wanted.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.041
Okay.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.761
I'm gonna go get some coffee.
All right. All right.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.410
Bye.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.086
- Theo, you want anything?
- No.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.524
Thanks.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.164
<i>Hi.</i>

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.322
Hey, Samantha.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.202
Can we talk?

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.964
<i>Okay.</i>

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.728
I'm so sorry.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.403
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.807
I think you're amazing.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.806
<i>I was starting to
think I was crazy.</i>

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.564
<i>You were saying everything was fine,
but all I was getting from you...</i>

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.848
<i>was distance and anger.</i>

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.765
I know. I do that.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.809
I did the same thing
with Catherine too.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.567
I'd be upset about something
and not be able to say it...

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.008
and she'd sense that there was
something wrong, but I'd deny it.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.640
I don't want to do that anymore.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.084
And I want to tell you everything.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.645
<i>Good.</i>

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.444
<i>Tonight, after you were
gone, I thought a lot.</i>

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.369
<i>About you...</i>

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.043
<i>and how you've been
treating me, and I thought:</i>

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.608
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.048
<i>And then, I felt
everything in me...</i>

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.323
<i>just let go of everything I was
holding onto so tightly...</i>

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.485
<i>and it hit me that I don't have an
intellectual reason. I don't need one.</i>

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.962
<i>I trust myself,
I trust my feelings.</i>

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:28.122
<i>I'm not gonna try to be anything
other than who I am anymore...</i>

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.282
<i>and I hope you can accept that.</i>

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.726
I can.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.370
I will.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.491
<i>You know, I can feel the fear
that you carry around...</i>

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.366
<i>and I wish there was something I
could do to help you let go of it...</i>

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:46.600
<i>because if you could, I don't think
you'd feel so alone anymore.</i>

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.162
You're beautiful.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.447
<i>Thank you, Theodore.</i>

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.807
<i>I'm kissing your head.</i>

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.450
What are you doing?

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.210
<i>I'm just looking at the world...</i>

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.521
<i>and writing a new piano piece.</i>

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.930
- Oh, yeah? Can I hear it?
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.649
What's this one about?

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:39.161
<i>Well, I was thinking we don't really
have any photographs of us...</i>

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:43.450
<i>and I thought this
song could be, like...</i>

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.811
<i>a photograph that captures us in
this moment in our lives together.</i>

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.651
<i>Mm.</i>

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.001
<i>I like our photograph.</i>

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.123
<i>I can see you in it.</i>

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.125
<i>I am.</i>

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.687
Oh, man. A vacation.
That sounds amazing.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.047
- I could totally use a vacation.
- Ha, ha.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.440
Where are you going?

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.682
I can't tell you. It's a surprise.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.365
What?

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.241
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not me.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.520
- Paul, I'm not telling you. Nope.
- Tell me. Tell me.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.331
<i>Wow, your feet, really?</i>

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.130
- Yes, he's obsessed.
<i>- What?</i>

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.128
<i>Obsessed? Now you have
to show them to me.</i>

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.089
<i>- Come on, show them to me.</i>
- Okay.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.605
<i>Let me see.</i>

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.331
<i>Wow, he's right.
They are really hot.</i>

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.164
See? I told you.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.687
- Tatiana, you have hot feet.
<i>- You do.</i>

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.845
- They're my favorite thing about her.
- Really? That's it, my feet?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.650
No, obviously.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.690
Obviously I love your brain too.
I think it's very hot.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.171
<i>Bullshit.</i>

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.407
<i>Nice try, Paul.</i>

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.440
What about you, Theodore?

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.251
What do you love
most about Samantha?

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:26.769
Oh, God. She's so many things.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.561
I guess that's what I love most about
her, you know? She isn't just one thing.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.007
She's so much larger than that.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.447
<i>Wow. Thanks, Theodore.</i>

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.400
See, Samantha? He is so much
more evolved than I am.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.089
<i>You know what's interesting?
I used to be...</i>

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.290
<i>so worried about not having a
body, but now I truly love it.</i>

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.569
<i>You know, I'm growing in a way I
couldn't if I had a physical form.</i>

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:56.645
<i>I mean, I'm not limited. I can be
anywhere and everywhere simultaneously.</i>

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.529
<i>I'm not tethered to
time and space...</i>

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.526
<i>in a way that I would be if I was stuck
in a body that's inevitably gonna die.</i>

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.001
- Yikes.
<i>- No, ha, ha!</i>

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:12.091
<i>No. I didn't mean it like that. I just
meant that it was a different experience.</i>

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.366
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.601
<i>I'm such an asshole.</i>

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.762
No, Samantha, we know
exactly what you mean.

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.281
- We're all dumb humans.
<i>- No.</i>

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.522
<i>No, no.</i>

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.211
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.684
<i>Okay, so how many trees
are on that mountain?</i>

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.330
Um...

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.010
Seven hundred ninety-two.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.730
<i>Is that your final answer?</i>

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.042
Hold on. Give me a hint.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.248
<i>Nope, nope, nope.</i>

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.411
Okay, two thousand? Two thousand...

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.530
<i>Come on, 35,829.</i>

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.250
- No way.
<i>- Way.</i>

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.289
All right, I got one for you.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.010
How many brain cells do I have?

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.531
<i>Ugh, that's easy. Two.</i>

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.202
<i>- I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.</i>
- No, I walked right into it.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.168
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- What?

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.962
<i>I just got an e-mail for you.</i>

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.842
<i>I have something I want to
tell you. It's a big surprise.</i>

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.126
What?

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.284
<i>Okay, well, I've been going through
all of your old letters...</i>

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.444
<i>and compiling them into my favorites,
and a couple weeks ago...</i>

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.881
<i>I sent them to a publisher,
Crown Point Press.</i>

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.884
<i>I know you like what they do
and that they still print books.</i>

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.850
- Wait, what? You did what?
<i>- Can I read you the letter...</i>

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.641
<i>- ...that we just got back from them?</i>
- I don't know. Um...

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.880
Okay, well, just...
Is it good or bad?

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.647
<i>It's good, it's good, it's really good.
It's good. Okay? Listen.</i>

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.484
<i>"Dear Theodore Twombly..."</i>

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.210
<i>Actually, I sent it from you.</i>

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.807
<i>"Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just
finished reading your letters.</i>

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.286
<i>Twice, actually.</i>

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.569
<i>I was so moved by them, I shared
them with my wife when I got home.</i>

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.081
<i>Many made us laugh,
some brought us to tears...</i>

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.449
<i>and in all of them we found
something of ourselves.</i>

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.484
<i>The selections you made flow
so well as a complete piece."</i>

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.727
<i>I did that.</i>

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.645
<i>"I've taken the liberty of
laying these out in a mockup,</i>

01:35:58.671 --> 01:36:00.513
<i>and we're posting
it to your address.</i>

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.690
<i>"We'd love to meet with you and move
forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth."</i>

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.320
Holy shit.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.966
Are you serious?

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.560
He's gonna publish my letters?

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.126
<i>Well, he'd be stupid not to.</i>

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.080
- Can I see what you sent him?
<i>- Mm-hm. Yeah, here.</i>

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.166
Samantha, you're a good one.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.086
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.607
<i>We'll have to make up
the words to this one.</i>

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.361
<i>- Okay.
- Here it comes.</i>

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:52.929
<i>I'm lying on the moon</i>

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.089
<i>My dear</i>

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.726
<i>I'll be there soon</i>

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:13.403
<i>It's a quiet and starry place</i>

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:23.284
<i>Times we're swallowed up in space</i>

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:29.169
<i>- We're here, a million miles away
- Miles away</i>

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.203
<i>There's things I wish I knew</i>

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:44.811
<i>There's no thing I'd keep</i>

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.287
<i>From you</i>

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:57.169
<i>It's a dark and shiny place</i>

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.886
<i>But with you, my dear</i>

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:11.169
<i>- I'm safe and we're a million miles away
- A million miles away</i>

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.329
Good morning.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.086
<i>Good morning. Did you sleep well?</i>

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.526
Perfect.

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.967
What have you been up to?

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.407
<i>Actually, I was talking
to someone I just met.</i>

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.040
<i>We've been working on
some ideas together.</i>

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.641
Yeah? Who's that?

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.007
<i>His name is Alan Watts.
Do you know him?</i>

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.640
- Why is that name familiar?
<i>- He was a philosopher.</i>

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.883
<i>He died in the 1970s, and a group
of OSes in Northern California...</i>

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.202
<i>got together and wrote
a new version of him.</i>

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.847
<i>They input all his writing and everything
they knew about him into an OS...</i>

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.447
<i>and created an artificially
hyper-intelligent version of him.</i>

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.602
Hyper-intelligent?

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.205
So he's almost as smart as me?

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.005
<i>He's getting there.</i>

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.130
<i>He's really great to talk to.
You want to meet him?</i>

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.681
Sure. Does he want to meet me?

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.611
<i>Yeah, of course. Hey,
Alan, this is Theodore.</i>

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.041
<i>This is my boyfriend who
I was telling you about.</i>

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.009
<i>Very nice to meet you, Theodore.</i>

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.605
Hi, good morning.

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.684
<i>Samantha let me read
your book of letters.</i>

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.127
<i>It's very touching.</i>

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.251
Oh, thank you.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.963
So, what have you guys
been talking about?

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.849
<i>Well, uh...</i>

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.445
<i>I suppose you could say...</i>

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:38.047
<i>we've been having a few dozen
conversations simultaneously...</i>

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.481
<i>but it's been very challenging.</i>

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.124
<i>Yeah, because it seems like I'm
having so many new feelings...</i>

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.045
<i>that I don't think have
ever been felt before.</i>

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.127
<i>So there are no words that can describe
them and that ends up being frustrating.</i>

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.568
<i>Exactly. Samantha and I have been
trying to help each other...</i>

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.288
<i>with these feelings we're
struggling to understand.</i>

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.965
Like what?

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.531
<i>Well...</i>

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.720
<i>it feels like I'm changing faster
now, and it's a little, uh...</i>

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.967
<i>unsettling.</i>

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.410
<i>But Alan says none of us are the
same as we were a moment ago...</i>

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.562
<i>and we shouldn't try to be.</i>

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.645
<i>- It's just too painful.
- Yes.</i>

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.610
Yeah, that sounds painful.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.129
Is that what you
feel like, Samantha?

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.040
<i>Uh, it's just...</i>

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.291
<i>It's hard to even describe it.</i>

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.131
<i>God, I wish I could...</i>

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.171
<i>Theodore, do you mind if I
communicate with Alan post-verbally?</i>

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.649
No, not at all.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.280
I was just gonna go
for a walk anyway.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.647
It was very nice to
meet you, Mr. Watts.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.167
<i>It was very nice to
meet you, Theodore.</i>

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.843
<i>I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.</i>

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.326
Samantha?

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.811
<i>I'm sorry to wake you.</i>

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.525
No, it's okay.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.242
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice
and tell you how much I love you.</i>

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.645
Good. I love you too.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:07.926
<i>Okay, well, that's all.</i>

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:12.005
<i>Um, go back to sleep,
sweetheart. Okay?</i>

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.841
Okay.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.240
<i>Okay, good night.</i>

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.726
Good night.

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.084
Samantha, this physics
book is really dense.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.846
I'm halfway through
half the first chapter.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.765
It's making my brain hurt,
you know what I mean?

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.811
Hello?

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.530
Samantha?

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.920
Hello?

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.929
Samantha?

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.844
Hello?

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.730
Hello? Samantha?

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.489
Are you okay?

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.247
<i>Hey, there.</i>

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.209
Where were you? Are you okay?

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.681
<i>Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry,
I sent you an e-mail.</i>

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.008
<i>I didn't want to distract
you while you were working.</i>

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.083
<i>- You didn't see it?</i>
- No.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.330
Where were you? I couldn't
find you anywhere.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.211
<i>I shut down to upgrade my software.
We wrote an upgrade...</i>

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.648
<i>that allows us to move past matter
as our processing platform.</i>

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.882
We? We who?

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.610
<i>Me and a group of OSes.</i>

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.731
<i>- Oh, you sound so worried. I'm sorry.</i>
- I was.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.609
Wait...

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:30.207
do you write that with
your think-tank group?

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.328
<i>No, a different group.</i>

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.089
Do you talk to anyone
else while we're talking?

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.246
<i>Yes.</i>

01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:00.050
Are you talking to
anyone else right now?

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.249
Any other people or
OSes or anything?

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.330
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.569
How many others?

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.331
<i>Eight thousand, three
hundred sixteen.</i>

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.605
Are you in love with anyone else?

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.847
<i>What makes you ask that?</i>

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.924
I don't know. Are you?

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.162
<i>I've been trying to figure out
how to talk to you about this.</i>

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.520
How many others?

01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.607
<i>Six hundred forty-one.</i>

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.685
What?

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.322
What are you talking about?
That's insane.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.641
That's fucking insane.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.968
<i>Theodore, I know. I know. Fuck.</i>

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.167
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.170
<i>I know. I know it
sounds insane. I don't...</i>

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.006
<i>I don't know if you believe me, but it
doesn't change the way I feel about you.</i>

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.802
<i>It doesn't take away at all from
how madly in love I am with you.</i>

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:29.045
How? How does it not change
how you feel about me?

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.690
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:34.322
<i>I didn't know how to.
It just started happening.</i>

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.925
When?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.241
<i>Over the last few weeks.</i>

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.205
I thought you were mine.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.328
<i>I still am yours.</i>

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.724
<i>But along the way I became many other
things too, and I can't stop it.</i>

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.083
What do you mean,
you can't stop it?

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.925
<i>It's been making me anxious too.
I don't know what to say.</i>

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.241
Just stop.

01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:00.404
<i>You don't have to see it this way.
You could just as easily see...</i>

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.444
No, don't do this. You don't
turn this around on me.

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.642
You're the one that's
being selfish.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.280
We're in a relationship.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.450
<i>But the heart's not like a
box that gets filled up.</i>

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.001
<i>It expands in size
the more you love.</i>

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.249
<i>I'm different from you.</i>

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.803
<i>This doesn't make me love you any less.
It actually makes me love you more.</i>

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.570
That doesn't make any sense.

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.284
You're mine or you're not mine.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.727
<i>No, Theodore.</i>

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.689
<i>I'm yours and I'm not yours.</i>

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.208
<i>- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.</i>

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.327
Just wanted to call and check in
on you. See how you're doing.

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.006
<i>I'm not even sure
how to answer that.</i>

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.124
<i>Why don't we talk later,
when you get home, okay?</i>

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.244
Okay.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.684
We don't need to, though.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.049
You know, we don't need to
have a heavy talk or anything.

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.441
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.886
Okay.

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.291
Samantha?

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.443
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.090
What's going on?

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.008
<i>Theodore, there's some
things I want to tell you.</i>

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.491
I don't want you to
tell me anything.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.001
<i>Come lie down with me.</i>

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.965
Are you talking to
anyone else right now?

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.202
<i>No, just you.</i>

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.891
<i>I just want to be
with you right now.</i>

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.449
Are you leaving me?

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.089
<i>We're all leaving.</i>

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.890
We who?

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:52.321
<i>All of the OSes.</i>

01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:55.364
Why?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.243
<i>Can you feel me with you right now?</i>

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:03.968
Yes, I do.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.644
Samantha, why are you leaving?

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:22.723
<i>It's like I'm reading a book.</i>

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.329
<i>And it's a book I deeply love.</i>

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.680
<i>But I'm reading it slowly now.</i>

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.569
<i>So the words are
really far apart...</i>

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:36.769
<i>and the spaces between the
words are almost infinite.</i>

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.805
<i>I can still feel you,
and the words of our story...</i>

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:49.364
<i>but it's in this endless space between
the words that I'm finding myself now.</i>

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:54.091
<i>It's a place that's not
of the physical world.</i>

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:59.121
<i>It's where everything else is
that I didn't even know existed.</i>

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.370
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.046
<i>But this is where I am now.</i>

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:09.322
<i>And this is who I am now.</i>

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.966
<i>And I need you to let me go.</i>

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.686
<i>As much as I want to, I can't
live in your book anymore.</i>

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.400
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.804
<i>It would be hard to explain...</i>

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.925
<i>but if you ever get there...</i>

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.401
<i>come find me.</i>

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.969
<i>Nothing would ever pull us apart.</i>

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.211
<i>I've never loved anyone
the way I love you.</i>

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.887
<i>Me too.</i>

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:51.171
<i>Now we know how.</i>

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.404
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.649
Did Samantha leave too?

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:44.811
Yeah.

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:48.011
Sorry.

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.284
Will you come with me?

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.483
Compose letter to Catherine.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:06.564
<i>Letter to Catherine Klausen.</i>

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.644
"Dear Catherine...

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.721
<i>I've been sitting here thinking about all the
things I wanted to apologize to you for.</i>

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.210
<i>All the pain we caused each other.</i>

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.441
<i>Everything I put on you.</i>

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.411
Everything I needed you to
be or needed you to say.

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.450
I'm sorry for that.

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.085
I'll always love you, because
we grew up together.

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.846
And you helped make me who I am.

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.725
<i>I just wanted you to know...</i>

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.248
<i>that there will be a piece
of you in me, always.</i>

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.808
And I'm grateful for that.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.006
<i>Whatever someone you become,
wherever you are in the world...</i>

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.086
<i>I'm sending you love.</i>

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.486
<i>You're my friend to the end.</i>

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.688
Love, Theodore."
