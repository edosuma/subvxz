WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:11.760
[engine rumbles and tyres squeal]

00:15.800 --> 00:19.280
I don't know, Ariston.
I mean, Mangle looks the same to me.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.440
I'm telling you,
Mangle's different somehow.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.920
Because of the... crystal.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.200
Yeah, like I told you,
the crystal flew out of the box--

00:29.280 --> 00:31.920
And into Mangle's head, yeah, right.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.920
It did, I promise you.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.560
Chike, you believe this guy?

00:35.640 --> 00:37.840
Guess I could always take
Mangle's head apart,

00:37.920 --> 00:39.800
see if that crystal thingy's
really in there.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.200
-Make sure he's not damaged.
-No! I'm sure Mangle's just fine.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.480
Which is more than I can say for us.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.360
Just tell Lanista the truth.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.800
Sure. Because what dad wouldn't want

00:50.880 --> 00:54.000
their daughter out all night battling
a bunch of Corvus Centurions?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.760
Yeah. Guess he'd be upset
knowing you could've been hurt.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.800
Ha! Me? He'd be more upset knowing
our Combatabots could've been hurt.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.120
[tyres screech]

01:04.080 --> 01:05.880
[all grunt]

01:06.360 --> 01:09.400
-[tires screech]
-Remember we've got a Robozuna game today.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.640
Remember, Feronia was captured
by Corvus. Forget some game.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.480
Robozuna's not just some game!

01:15.960 --> 01:18.320
Not to my dad. Not to a lot of people.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.960
Yeah, well,
Lanista doesn't know everything.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.080
[Ariston's voice]
<i>Lanista doesn't know everything.</i>

01:24.160 --> 01:27.720
Whoa-ho! Hear that! Told you.
Mangle's different.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.360
-Never done that before.
-Trouble.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.640
Yep. Repeat it in front of my dad
and there's going to be big trouble.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.280
No! Trouble... now!

01:39.440 --> 01:40.880
[tyres squeal and laughter]

01:40.960 --> 01:42.120
[whooping]

01:42.960 --> 01:47.520
Hey, nice robots!
Looking for a scrap-metal yard?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.960
No! Heading to Botrus arena.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.560
We're Team Veredus!

01:51.640 --> 01:54.400
Oh! Team Veredus!

01:54.720 --> 01:56.320
I've heard of you.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.440
Yeah, last place in the Border League!
[laughs] You're a joke!

02:00.520 --> 02:02.560
Hey! We won our last game!

02:02.640 --> 02:04.840
[engine revs and tyres squeal]

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
Oops.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.280
[laughter]

02:09.360 --> 02:11.600
-[engine revs and tyres screech]
-Ah!

02:11.680 --> 02:13.440
-Who was that?
-Don't know.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.560
Someone must've lifted a rock
and that's who crawled out.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.240
[tyres screech]

02:24.360 --> 02:26.240
Great. And here they come again.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.560
Woo-hoo!

02:32.680 --> 02:34.640
[tyres screech and yelling]

02:34.720 --> 02:37.560
-Hey, that could've hit us!
-Those guys are crazy!

02:39.280 --> 02:40.600
[tyres screech]

02:40.680 --> 02:42.040
[engine revs]

02:44.120 --> 02:45.040
I got this!

02:52.400 --> 02:53.960
[both scream]

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
[tyres squeal]

02:56.000 --> 02:58.360
[laughs] Nice one, Livia!

02:58.440 --> 03:00.680
Uh, not so nice.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.440
[all yell]

03:04.200 --> 03:05.280
[tyres squeal]

03:05.560 --> 03:07.920
[yelling]

03:33.000 --> 03:36.080
[yelling]

03:36.160 --> 03:38.720
[screaming and brakes squeal]

03:41.040 --> 03:43.680
-That was scary.
-And so's that!

03:46.760 --> 03:49.960
-Hold on! We're going to... crash?
-[thud]

03:50.280 --> 03:51.280
[tyres squeal]

03:52.600 --> 03:53.680
[grunts]

03:57.560 --> 03:58.720
No crash.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.720
Okay. Maybe I do believe you
about that crystal.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.920
He's the coolest robot I've ever seen.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.160
[engine revs and tyres squeal]

04:19.040 --> 04:20.920
[Ariston]
<i>Lanista doesn't know everything.</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:23.160
Okay, cool that you can do that.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.200
But not cool to repeat
everything you hear.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.920
Uh... Dad, before you get mad--

04:29.000 --> 04:29.960
Not mad.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.920
Niven and the other drillers you saved
were here.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.400
They filled me in on the details.
Doesn't mean I'm happy my daughter

04:36.480 --> 04:39.520
and her two friends took on Corvus,
but I understand.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.960
Don't worry, Niven is finding out
where Corvus took Feronia.

04:45.240 --> 04:49.240
In the meantime, knowing Feronia,
she'll take care of herself.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.840
Now that you're both part of the team,
you and Mangle will be staying with us.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.640
On Team Veredus? You hear that, Mangle?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.000
We're part of the team!

05:00.360 --> 05:02.120
Do I get to use a tech pad?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
[both] No!

05:04.800 --> 05:07.360
It's not all fun and games.
You're a teammate now

05:07.440 --> 05:09.000
and you have responsibilities.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.840
You can't go running off whenever
you like, and you have to practise.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.840
All of you, we've got a game today!
Come on, let's go!

05:17.080 --> 05:20.240
Wait. Did he say "knowing Feronia"?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.680
Your dad... he knew her?

05:35.080 --> 05:38.880
I tried to teach Mangle
some Robozuna moves and never could.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.080
Should've known better. Bots can't learn.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.560
Think maybe you could reprogram him
to be a Combatabot?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.280
Don't think he needs reprogramming.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.920
Looks like he's learning
pretty well on his own.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.120
The taser-jab!

05:54.640 --> 05:56.240
The Clunk-a-matic!

05:58.600 --> 06:01.760
Mangle, you... you can learn?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.200
Got to be the crystal, right?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.600
Maybe. If it is, you don't
want others finding out.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.400
Better to keep it and all these new things
Mangle's doing a secret.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.080
[Lanista] You three, stop gawking!
Get those Combatabots ready!

06:15.160 --> 06:18.640
It's almost game time!
And remember, this is a big one.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.120
We're playing Team Natrix.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.400
Rumour has it they've been bought
by Corvus!

06:31.160 --> 06:36.720
Go, Team Natrix! Mash 'em, bash 'em,
smash 'em and crash 'em!

06:36.800 --> 06:39.960
Oh, yeah, uh-huh, uh-oh-ah-ah-ooh!

06:40.800 --> 06:44.240
-Hello, Robozuna fans!
-[cheering]

06:44.320 --> 06:48.800
Slick and Spanner here at Botrus Arena
with our pre-game warm-up.

06:48.880 --> 06:53.480
And, Robo-Robozuna, do we have
a spectacle for you today!

06:53.560 --> 06:55.280
Ha! That's right, Slick.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.440
And, as you can see, the Team Veredus
Combatabots are already on the field,

06:59.520 --> 07:03.200
practising their Robozuna moves!
Wham! Bam! Slam!

07:03.480 --> 07:08.200
Right. And up in the royal box is none
other than her highness, Danuvia Malum.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.200
No doubt excited to see the team
Corvus has just bought play!

07:12.280 --> 07:14.800
Look, Spanner, here comes Team Natrix now!

07:15.400 --> 07:18.840
Let's hear it for Pounder,
Blockhead and Torch!

07:18.920 --> 07:22.480
And the new team coaches, Gizi and Zeve!

07:22.560 --> 07:27.240
Oh, look, sis! It's the botbrains
we ran into on the way here.

07:27.320 --> 07:32.320
What's the matter? Couldn't find a big
enough recycler to drop your bots in?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.560
[cackles]

07:33.640 --> 07:36.640
Wait, are you two with Team Natrix?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.480
What happened to their old coach?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.320
You might say he was, uh... retired.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.440
How did you two get the job?

07:43.520 --> 07:44.680
We're talented.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.800
We're skilful.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.680
Oh! And we're Danuvia's niece and nephew.
[chuckles]

07:49.760 --> 07:52.960
And you're our next victims!

07:53.040 --> 07:56.400
[scoffs]
I've seen meaner looking toy robots!

07:56.840 --> 07:58.320
[bleeps]

08:03.960 --> 08:06.160
[growls and grunts]

08:06.760 --> 08:08.880
The Pounder grounder!

08:12.800 --> 08:15.280
The full metal meltdown!

08:18.320 --> 08:20.680
The pinch and sting!

08:20.760 --> 08:25.720
Pounder grounder, full metal meltdown,
pinch and sting.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.840
Nothing to see here,
and we've got our own practising to do.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.560
[Zeve's voice] <i>Botbrains.</i>

08:31.640 --> 08:35.680
Okay. I'm liking that the crystal
somehow lets you learn new stuff,

08:35.760 --> 08:39.200
but careful, not everything
everyone teaches you is good.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.920
[sighs]

08:43.000 --> 08:45.360
Ah, Commander Vermis. Time to go?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
Oh, the game hasn't even begun.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.400
And you wouldn't want to miss
the beautiful barbarity

08:51.480 --> 08:54.040
of bots pulverizing bots, would you?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.400
Spare me.

08:55.480 --> 09:01.080
My father only set up these Robozuna games
to keep the masses distracted. Ugh.

09:01.720 --> 09:06.560
I understand. It must be difficult
to watch those Team Natrix Combatabots

09:06.640 --> 09:09.800
so easily smashing up your Centurions.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.440
Yes, there are rumours

09:12.520 --> 09:16.320
that it was Combatabots who smashed
up my Centurions last night,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.960
when you allowed those drillers to escape.

09:20.040 --> 09:25.320
But I anticipated the day when outlaws
would turn bots against Corvus

09:25.400 --> 09:31.200
and I've got a little surprise for them...
the next time they try.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.000
The venom-bots.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.720
I have news, but perhaps we should
discuss this some place more private.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.960
Oh, please! That thing is just
another mindless bot.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.240
They only do what they're programmed
to do. They can't think.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.800
Say whatever you want.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.320
Very well.
The latest prisoner-transfer logs.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.280
They have been uploaded to your airship.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.680
I'll bet...
those two know where Feronia is.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.880
Ariston right.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.760
Wait. What? Right?

10:07.240 --> 10:10.400
-You... you heard something over there?
-Mm!

10:10.480 --> 10:12.480
Well, what is it? Tell us!

10:12.560 --> 10:15.280
[Ariston's voice]
<i>Not cool to repeat everything you hear.</i>

10:15.360 --> 10:17.400
[groans] This time, it's cool.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
[Vermis]
<i>The latest prisoner-transfer logs.</i>

10:20.480 --> 10:22.520
<i>They've been uploaded to your airship.</i>

10:23.440 --> 10:24.920
You know what this means?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.680
Yeah. Better be careful
what I say around Mangle.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.320
The prisoner-transfer logs,
they can help us find Feronia!

10:31.400 --> 10:34.040
Right! And all we have to do
is break into

10:34.120 --> 10:37.280
a heavily guarded Corvus airship
and steal them.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.960
Didn't say it'd be easy.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.480
Because it's impossible!

10:40.560 --> 10:42.040
Besides, you heard my dad.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.560
Niven is taking care of Feronia.
We need to focus on the game.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.360
Don't worry. We'll be back
before anyone notices we're gone.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.160
Hm. Ariston say that before.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.480
Danuvia's airship... [sighs]
and a whole lot of Centurions.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.360
Step away. Any closer,
and you will be my prisoners!

11:25.800 --> 11:29.000
If Centurions see us,
they could identify us later.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.600
I'll need to access
their memory module and erase...

11:37.200 --> 11:40.640
Or we could just... deal with it your way.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.840
Step away. My prisoners. Step away.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.040
Shh!

12:01.280 --> 12:02.720
[bleeping]

12:03.880 --> 12:04.880
[sighs]

12:04.960 --> 12:07.000
Access denied. Ah!

12:10.440 --> 12:11.480
[groans]

12:11.560 --> 12:14.120
[whooping bleep]

12:14.200 --> 12:16.120
Turn around. Do not move.

12:16.960 --> 12:22.440
You do realise it's impossible
to not move and turn around.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.160
I say we deal with this your way.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.600
-Shush!
-We better get out of here fast.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.360
Mangle have idea.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.280
[whoops]

12:43.480 --> 12:44.680
[gasps]

12:44.760 --> 12:45.800
[tyre squeals]

12:48.240 --> 12:50.400
[tyres squeal]

12:50.480 --> 12:51.920
[engines rev]

12:52.000 --> 12:56.840
Nice riding, Mangle! Guess those years
on the back of my bike are now paying off!

12:56.920 --> 12:58.000
You ride like me!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.400
-Mangle!
-[groans]

13:00.480 --> 13:01.480
[Ariston yells]

13:08.960 --> 13:10.760
[both yell]

13:12.840 --> 13:15.040
Mangle crash like you, too.

13:15.120 --> 13:15.960
Let's go!

13:17.920 --> 13:19.560
[grunts]

13:22.760 --> 13:25.320
-Mangle... plan.
-[grunts]

13:32.600 --> 13:34.560
Come on, Mangle! We got to run!

13:44.280 --> 13:45.680
Now run.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.840
[grunts]

13:52.200 --> 13:53.480
[Mangle groans]

13:56.040 --> 13:56.880
Oh!

13:58.480 --> 14:00.640
[grunts and groans]

14:01.000 --> 14:01.840
Mm?

14:03.600 --> 14:07.920
Shoo! Get out of here! Go on! Get!

14:08.400 --> 14:10.440
Sorry! Wish we could stay.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.280
[crowd cheering]

14:19.520 --> 14:22.160
[Slick] Spark has grabbed up the thudball
and it looks like

14:22.240 --> 14:24.600
he's hoping to put an end to round one.

14:24.680 --> 14:29.480
[Spanner chuckles] Yeah, but watch out,
'cause here comes Team Natrix's Blockhead!

14:32.200 --> 14:35.360
Get close, you're toast, Blockhead!

14:35.440 --> 14:37.560
Get ready for the taser-jab!

14:38.160 --> 14:41.160
Ah. [gibbers] Whoa. Hey.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.280
[chuckles] Look who's shocked now!

14:44.360 --> 14:46.520
Yeah! [whoops]

14:46.600 --> 14:49.240
Blockhead must be insulated
against electrical currents.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.400
Spark! Find his weak spot!

14:51.480 --> 14:53.000
Got to have a weak spot, right?

14:54.520 --> 14:58.600
Now, you can get ready
for the pinch and sting!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.120
Yeah, got to be quicker than that!

15:02.720 --> 15:05.720
[grunts and groans]

15:05.800 --> 15:08.960
Spark's out cold. Giving him
a juice boost to bring him back.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.640
[groans and gibbers]

15:23.840 --> 15:26.120
Yeah! Found his weak spot.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.120
Blockhead's heel was his Achilles heel!
[chuckles]

15:33.120 --> 15:35.920
Wah! His quadricep capacitors are damaged!

15:36.360 --> 15:37.920
Spark can't move his legs!

15:38.000 --> 15:41.560
Get up, Blockhead,
or you're off to the scrap yard!

15:42.800 --> 15:44.560
[groans] Eh?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.800
[chuckles and grunts]

15:47.880 --> 15:51.480
Prepare for my pinch and sting!

15:51.560 --> 15:55.600
No. Prepare to witness
my thudball thunder!

15:57.960 --> 16:01.720
-[cheering]
-Robo-Robozuna! What a game!

16:01.800 --> 16:06.400
<i>Thunderous shot from Spark there.</i>
<i>Team Veredus wins round one! Ha-ha!</i>

16:06.480 --> 16:10.080
Remind me again why you like this game.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.720
All right, Spark's damaged.
No time to repair him.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.640
But if Clunk can win round two,

16:15.720 --> 16:18.760
we'll win this game
without Mangle and Ariston.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.960
I commed Ariston before round one.
Said they were hurrying back.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.680
Lanista is so not going to like this.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.960
Even if we make it back
before the game's over,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.800
you're in no shape to play.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.720
[Slick whoops]

16:53.800 --> 16:58.640
And it's another lucky break for
Team Veredus as Clunk grabs the thudball.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.560
Right you are, Slick. And this round two
action is about to really heat up,

17:03.640 --> 17:06.800
because here comes Team Natrix's Torch!

17:06.880 --> 17:11.720
I'm fired up! And you're about
to have the full metal meltdown!

17:11.800 --> 17:15.720
[Slick] Hold on to your headsets,
because here comes trouble!

17:22.240 --> 17:23.560
Uh? Ooh? Uh?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.120
[Slick] He's in trouble now!

17:26.280 --> 17:27.120
[grunts]

17:28.360 --> 17:29.600
[groans]

17:29.680 --> 17:32.680
Clunk's overheating!
All systems shutting down!

17:37.080 --> 17:41.720
-Oh yeah, we're too hot to handle!
-[laughs]

17:41.800 --> 17:44.480
And they're having an emotional meltdown!

17:45.440 --> 17:47.640
[Slick] He's going in for the score!

17:49.720 --> 17:52.880
-Robo-Robozuna! Team Natrix scores!
-[cheering]

17:52.960 --> 17:56.920
It's just like a nice gift box.
This Robozuna game is all tied up!

17:59.200 --> 18:01.880
Uh, so, how's it going?

18:01.960 --> 18:03.560
We need Mangle for the last round.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.720
He's our only chance to win and...
What's wrong with his leg?

18:07.960 --> 18:08.920
Long story.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.920
He always says that.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.640
Oh, just get him out there.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.920
Time for The Pounder grounder!

18:21.800 --> 18:22.800
[groans]

18:23.520 --> 18:25.880
Ouch! Round three has just begun

18:25.960 --> 18:29.200
and it already looks painful
for Team Veredus!

18:29.280 --> 18:31.880
Team Natrix! Team Natrix!

18:31.960 --> 18:34.680
[both] Pounder! Pounder! Pounder!

18:36.440 --> 18:39.680
Come on. Come on. Finish it!

18:42.960 --> 18:44.440
[cackles]

18:45.080 --> 18:47.160
Where do you think you're going?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.160
Mangle... think.

18:54.040 --> 18:54.960
What's he doing?

18:56.160 --> 18:57.000
Thinking?

19:01.120 --> 19:02.680
The pinch and sting!

19:04.440 --> 19:05.400
[grunts]

19:07.400 --> 19:09.440
The full metal meltdown!

19:12.920 --> 19:14.680
[groans]

19:15.040 --> 19:16.600
The Pounder grounder!

19:19.160 --> 19:20.760
[cheering]

19:22.760 --> 19:25.560
[Team Veredus chant]
Mangle! Mangle! Mangle...

19:27.560 --> 19:30.960
-[cheering]
-[whoops] Robo-Robozuna!

19:31.040 --> 19:36.840
Mangle uses the Team Natrix moves against
them to win round three and the game!

19:37.320 --> 19:38.600
Team Veredus!

19:38.680 --> 19:41.840
Mangle mashed 'em, bashed 'em
and smashed 'em!

19:41.920 --> 19:43.520
Mangle rocks!

19:46.600 --> 19:49.800
It was your useless Combatabot
that lost us the game!

19:50.320 --> 19:53.680
Yeah, well, it was your idea
to put him in!

19:55.640 --> 19:57.400
I have bad news.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.280
I saw. We lost.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.320
Who cares? It's only a game.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.040
Not about the game.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.920
Intruders broke into your airship,
fried the computer.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
Ugh!

20:10.720 --> 20:13.280
-[whooping and laughter]
-[kids] Yes!

20:13.360 --> 20:16.760
I'm glad we won,
but I'm still upset with you, Ariston.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.320
You were impulsive.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.360
You only thought about your own agenda.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.640
You put yourself and Mangle in danger
and you let the team down.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.000
We need you and Mangle,
but you need to learn to work as a team.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.840
Sorry. You're right.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.720
From now on, I promise,
I won't ever abandon the team again.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.360
I'm sure you are sorry

20:38.440 --> 20:40.760
and you'll be even sorrier
after you wax the transporter.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.000
I understand why you want to take
on Corvus, but it can't be done.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.160
No good will ever come from trying.
Believe me, I learnt the hard way.

20:50.440 --> 20:54.120
So, does that mean I don't have
to wax the transporter?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.400
No. Just means I understand.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.120
[sighs] Lanista was right.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.560
There's no point taking on Corvus.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.280
We couldn't even get
the prisoner-transfer logs.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.960
Mangle fried the computer.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.840
Mangle not fry.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.880
Mangle download.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.520
[Ariston] The prisoner-transfer logs?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.560
Okay, now I believe you!

21:25.640 --> 21:26.600
Finally!

21:27.760 --> 21:31.560
Pretty impressive stuff, Mangle.
And useful!

21:31.640 --> 21:34.000
Now we know where Feronia is!

21:34.080 --> 21:36.320
We can free her!
We can leave tonight and--

21:36.400 --> 21:38.320
-[both] Ariston!
-What?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.280
[Ariston's voice] <i>From now on, I promise,</i>

21:41.360 --> 21:43.560
<i>I won't ever abandon the team again.</i>
