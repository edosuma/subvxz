01:33.135 --> 01:34.636
I won't die, right?

01:35.970 --> 01:39.056
You'll probably clean out your parasites
for your whole life.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.352
What? It's edible, right?

01:42.435 --> 01:44.020
You have to take it seriously.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.856
I told you. Only five drops
or it will make you purge.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.278
You've been warned.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.586
Hello, hello.
Good morning. How is everybody?

06:23.132 --> 06:24.133
-Hi, Pia.
-Hi.

06:24.216 --> 06:25.342
-How are you?
-I'm good.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.178
-Everything's okay?
-Yes, yes.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.660
We need the coffee?

08:17.705 --> 08:20.708
-The berries?
-Yes. Let's look at everything.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.503
I'll put them here.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.462
Thanks.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.179
Did you pull out the snail?

08:34.346 --> 08:36.974
No, but I'm going to.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.601
But that's sad.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.980
He's hiding.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.817
No, no! Leave him in there.

15:25.841 --> 15:31.055
Look, Andrés.
This one is no good. See?

15:31.138 --> 15:35.767
These two are attached,
so they're not useful for us.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.311
You can throw them back.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.772
But look, this one is perfect.

15:41.565 --> 15:46.362
It's green, crystalline
and perfectly round.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.337
Malena, how many do you have?

16:04.588 --> 16:05.631
A few.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.936
-Is this the hoje tree?
-Yes, its resin is medicinal.

17:01.853 --> 17:04.315
-Can you eat it?
-It will take you to your grave.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.758
-Is the root consumed?
-No.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.010
-No. It's used for a tambo, a house.
-Yeah.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.430
-Where you live and sleep.
-Okay.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.270
Over here.
We found some of those really thorny ones.

18:24.353 --> 18:28.565
We'll have to figure out how to identify
these because we also saw them in Ancash.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.655
I'll take these down.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.449
Andrés, what have you found?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.201
Look for some of the white ones,

18:40.286 --> 18:42.288
because we haven't used those before.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.642
They call this one "chilca,"

19:03.725 --> 19:06.978
which is odd,
because chilca is also the name

19:07.062 --> 19:10.232
used for other plants
which are totally different.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.401
So it's going to be difficult
to identify it.

19:13.319 --> 19:17.072
Quechua is not written,
so you have to sense how to write it.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.449
The way we hear it?

19:18.532 --> 19:22.453
Exactly, which at least
helps us to register it.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.360
This is the one they call "anise"?

19:54.443 --> 19:58.489
Yes. And it actually grows
in different regions.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.242
-Different altitudes?
-Yes.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.785
I actually have some here to compare...

20:03.869 --> 20:09.833
You can see that it's super different
at different altitudes.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.293
That's the same plant?

20:11.377 --> 20:14.380
Yes, it's the same species,
but from a different place.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.769
This should go straight to Central
so we can cook it right away.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.855
The rest, keep here to study.

20:38.278 --> 20:42.074
Okay, Pia, we can do it here.
This is <i>sangre de grado.</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:50.707
It comes from this tree bark.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.709
It has an incredible color, right?

21:11.937 --> 21:15.231
I'll say it again.
Two chickens, two mountains,

21:15.316 --> 21:19.152
a small octopus, a pumpkin dish.

21:19.235 --> 21:23.449
-How is table seven?
-It's not ready yet.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.867
Give me four octopuses.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.288
-I can't hear you.
-Got it!

21:29.371 --> 21:30.581
Thank you.

21:38.254 --> 21:40.924
-Pia?
-I'm here. What?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.386
-What's missing?
-Strength.

22:32.726 --> 22:33.935
I don't know if I like it.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.229
I like it because of the colors,

22:36.312 --> 22:40.316
but the flavor not so much.

24:22.503 --> 24:26.089
-Can I try that?
-Of course. Come in.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.511
-But you have to sing.
-Hand over your weapon.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.846
Over there.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.736
Here, I'm going to do it.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.905
Watch me.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.701
Like this.

24:57.328 --> 24:59.831
Like that. Very good!

25:00.749 --> 25:01.750
You learned.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.214
Now you're a country man!

25:17.182 --> 25:19.350
That's beautiful...

25:19.434 --> 25:21.770
-Authentic piscoronto.
-Piscoronto?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.105
And this one's "culie."

25:24.189 --> 25:25.566
-Culie?
-Culie.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.697
Okay. Culie. Write it down.

26:40.306 --> 26:41.599
We love these.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.771
We use them with a technique
your wife showed us.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.650
Ours are not as good as your wife's...

26:49.733 --> 26:51.234
but we try, right?

28:23.744 --> 28:25.578
How are you, friends?
Everything good?

30:02.383 --> 30:04.845
The heart... Peluche?

32:12.847 --> 32:13.974
A thin one...

32:17.978 --> 32:19.270
Like this...

32:20.105 --> 32:21.439
Like this.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.733
No, lay it down.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.612
No. It's not done that way.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.405
It's done this way.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.533
This one is wrong.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.910
Sorry, my sister keeps screwing it up!

35:54.860 --> 35:56.904
Now we can eat.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.473
He's sitting up!

46:13.395 --> 46:15.940
-Little Cristobal!
-Little Cristobal!
