17:28.030 --> 17:29.622
- Yeah.
- Here. Let's sit here.

17:29.698 --> 17:31.215
- Oh, you look cute.
- Come sit.

17:31.292 --> 17:32.708
- Come sit right in here.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.668
- Oh, thanks, guys.

17:34.745 --> 17:36.504
I forget
how beautiful this place is.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.005
- Isn't it so pretty?
- It's so pretty.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.548
- How are you?
How are you feeling?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.008
- I'm not symptomatic

17:41.085 --> 17:42.968
and I'm clear and I know
I've just hugged you and--

17:43.045 --> 17:44.804
- No, I'm fine.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.397
- Obviously, I wouldn't be--
- Let me tell you something.

17:46.474 --> 17:49.400
That is the least
of my concerns today.

17:49.477 --> 17:50.476
- I know. I know.
- I know you know.

17:50.553 --> 17:51.644
- Oh, Erika.
- I know.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.895
<i> - You look at Erika</i>
<i> and you think</i>

17:52.906 --> 17:54.355
she's set for life.

17:54.431 --> 17:56.407
She don't have to worry
about anything, right?

17:57.744 --> 17:58.910
You just never know.

17:58.986 --> 18:00.861
- There she is.
Hi, gorgeous.

18:00.938 --> 18:02.488
- Hey, honey. How are you?

18:02.565 --> 18:04.824
- Should I bring with
this cheeseboard to there?

18:04.900 --> 18:06.242
- Sure. Thank you so much.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.409
- Right?
- Yes.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.579
- Ooh. What's that?
Is that sausage?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.040
- Well, you look beautiful.
- I know. Thank you.

18:13.117 --> 18:16.043
It's rough, to say the least.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.304
What happened today in court.

18:19.623 --> 18:22.383
- Were you there? Did you--
- Oh, no. It's in Chicago.

18:22.459 --> 18:23.717
Because...
- Why in Chicago though?

18:23.794 --> 18:24.885
- It's a federal case.

18:24.962 --> 18:26.887
- Have you talked to
Robert Shapiro?

18:26.964 --> 18:28.597
- I know Bob very well.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.775
- I mean, we're like family.
And just say hi and--

18:30.852 --> 18:32.393
- I don't know if he's team Tom
or whatever,

18:32.469 --> 18:33.686
but we'll see.
- And then there's that.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.855
- There's a little bit of that
going on too.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.398
- Are you talking to him
at all?

18:37.474 --> 18:39.733
- Absolutely not.
When I left, I left.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.277
And that's it.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.954
And that hurts too.
- That's hard too, yeah.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.406
- That's very hard because
you're married to somebody

18:45.482 --> 18:47.366
for 20 years
and you know they're struggling

18:47.443 --> 18:49.535
and you know that
they are not in a good place,

18:49.612 --> 18:52.630
but I'm actually,
in some ways, very relieved.

18:52.707 --> 18:54.966
His attorney said that

18:55.042 --> 18:58.377
she feels that he is
not mentally well.

18:58.454 --> 19:00.471
This is something
that I have said.

19:00.548 --> 19:02.965
One of the reasons
that I filed for divorce

19:02.976 --> 19:04.809
is the resistance to anything.

19:04.886 --> 19:07.428
"Hey, you know, I've noticed
that you can't see well."

19:07.504 --> 19:08.929
"What are you talking about?
I'm fine."

19:09.006 --> 19:12.600
"No, you can't see well.
You can't hear.

19:12.676 --> 19:15.319
You're ----ing degrading
in front of me

19:15.396 --> 19:17.029
and you're ignoring it."

19:18.733 --> 19:23.736
And no one would listen to me.
I tried and I tried.

19:23.812 --> 19:25.946
What I was seeing,
what I was experiencing,

19:26.023 --> 19:29.617
what I was hearing.
I was right.

19:29.693 --> 19:33.954
And maybe finally he can get
the help that he needs.

19:34.031 --> 19:37.425
Tom was changing, you know,
this was overtime.

19:38.827 --> 19:42.338
When you're slowly
watching someone unravel,

19:42.348 --> 19:43.848
it's a hard thing to do.

19:43.925 --> 19:45.966
I mean, I'm sorry that
I'm just so drained.

19:46.043 --> 19:47.351
And so--
- Oh, my God, Erika.

19:47.428 --> 19:49.678
- Don't be sorry.
- It's so understandable.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.597
- I'm getting dragged
into all of this.

19:51.674 --> 19:53.682
- Yeah, I know.
- Why is that though?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.142
- They do that,
if you're married--

19:55.219 --> 19:56.644
- Well, you're married.
- They just do it.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.604
- Exactly.
When PK went through

19:58.681 --> 20:00.648
his legal woes last year...
- Uh-huh.

20:00.724 --> 20:03.609
- And this is before
he ever even knew me.

20:03.686 --> 20:04.944
I was dragged in it.

20:05.020 --> 20:08.489
I was--my name was smeared.
I was a part of it.

20:08.565 --> 20:10.374
And not only did
I not know this guy,

20:10.451 --> 20:12.993
I'd never even heard of him.
- You didn't even know Paul--

20:13.070 --> 20:14.495
- I didn't even know PK.

20:14.571 --> 20:18.666
It's very normal for
a husband and wife not to know

20:18.742 --> 20:21.835
all the business dealings
of their spouse.

20:21.912 --> 20:26.131
- This man has been in business
since before I was born in '71.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.384
<i> - I really don't think Tom</i>
<i> married Erika</i>

20:28.394 --> 20:30.010
for her accounting skills.

20:30.087 --> 20:32.563
- Marriage is based on trust.
- Yeah.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.724
- If my husband come in and say
"Here, sign

20:35.735 --> 20:38.519
these 50 papers
where the X is,"

20:38.595 --> 20:41.480
what do I--sit there and go
over everything little paper?

20:41.557 --> 20:43.691
No, I sign it
because I trust my husband.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.068
- Also, too, when you enter
a marriage like I did,

20:46.079 --> 20:49.196
you know, the power balance
is so out of whack.

20:49.273 --> 20:53.084
I've been a bimbo gold-digging
trophy wife.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.538
Now all of a sudden,
I am a financial mastermind

20:57.614 --> 20:59.707
<i> that had my finger</i>
<i> on the pulse of everything.</i>

20:59.783 --> 21:01.875
When you're on for half,
you're on for half.

21:01.952 --> 21:05.087
They don't care. They're just
doing it to (BLEEP) with you.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.714
- Okay, I'm very impressed
with this lasagna.

21:06.790 --> 21:07.840
It's beautiful.

21:07.916 --> 21:09.925
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.219
Okay, five, six.

21:12.296 --> 21:14.430
[both whispering]

21:14.440 --> 21:18.726
Erika was saying that he won't
listen in to help or her advice

21:18.802 --> 21:20.769
and you know,
he's always been like,

21:20.780 --> 21:23.114
it's almost like a dad-daughter
where he's like,

21:23.190 --> 21:25.783
"Excuse me, I'm talking."
And she's like, "Mm--"

21:25.860 --> 21:28.569
- That's a both positive
and a negative comment.

21:28.645 --> 21:30.529
I'm running the operation,
baby.

21:30.606 --> 21:32.957
- No sh--.
- Pardon me, Erika.

21:33.034 --> 21:36.744
- Tom was very much the one in
charge, controlling everything.

21:36.820 --> 21:40.205
He supported her career
and her dreams.

21:40.282 --> 21:42.583
And that was the price
she had to pay.

21:42.659 --> 21:44.626
It's an interesting dynamic.
- Yeah.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.471
- If it was painful at times
or difficult, she detached.

21:47.548 --> 21:50.924
That's easy for her to do.
We've seen it.

21:51.001 --> 21:52.801
- And how do you
like your house now?

21:52.812 --> 21:55.220
Are you, like,
are you settling in? And just--

21:55.297 --> 21:59.099
- Yeah, I mean,
we got a little tree.

21:59.176 --> 22:01.602
- Good.
- We've put some garland up.

22:01.678 --> 22:03.154
- It doesn't really feel
like Christmas,

22:03.230 --> 22:05.156
but you have to
kind of force it.

22:05.232 --> 22:06.607
- I'm going to wake up

22:06.683 --> 22:08.233
and it's still
going to be the same thing.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.735
So I might as well enjoy
a little bit.

22:09.812 --> 22:10.995
- Let me tell you.

22:11.072 --> 22:13.998
My dad shot himself two days
before Christmas.

22:14.075 --> 22:18.118
And if you want to talk
about a sucky Christmas--

22:18.195 --> 22:21.080
- God, that had to be horrible.
- It was a sucky--

22:21.156 --> 22:22.790
- How old were you
when he killed himself?

22:22.866 --> 22:25.009
- I was 32,
but Porter was nine months old.

22:25.086 --> 22:26.510
- Oh, my God.

22:26.587 --> 22:27.961
- Her very first Christmas.
I was so excited.

22:28.038 --> 22:29.963
- Right. And then
your father commits suicide.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.801
- Right. When tragic things
happen during the holiday time

22:33.877 --> 22:36.929
those rituals that we have,
keep you going.

22:37.005 --> 22:38.689
- Yeah. Had he been struggling?

22:38.766 --> 22:39.973
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:40.050 --> 22:41.683
- Yeah, we'd put him
in the hospital twice.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.527
So it was an ongoing thing,
but we didn't know

22:43.604 --> 22:45.312
he was going to do it
two days before Christmas.

22:45.389 --> 22:46.647
Like thanks, Dad.

22:46.723 --> 22:47.865
- What'd your mom say?

22:47.942 --> 22:50.201
- It was the first day
of her retirement.

22:50.277 --> 22:51.860
- (BLEEP).
- I know.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.154
And she was home.
She was so angry.

22:54.231 --> 22:56.156
- I bet she was.
- She was pissed.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.034
All marriages are complicated,
and whew, yeah.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.787
My mother doesn't share a lot.

23:01.864 --> 23:04.164
[crying] I wish you had come
to the opening.

23:04.241 --> 23:08.043
This is a big deal for me.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.879
And there's a lot
of dad in this.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.058
This is his writing
and it's on the building.

23:14.135 --> 23:16.677
It's on everything.

23:16.753 --> 23:19.730
And don't you miss him?
Like, a little?

23:19.807 --> 23:24.643
- You can't expect me to feel
about him as you do.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.729
It was my marriage to him,
not your marriage to him.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.909
And my relationship to him was
totally different from yours.

23:31.986 --> 23:34.695
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

23:34.771 --> 23:37.239
- It would be nice to know
that you missed him.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.916
- I don't miss him.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.995
- I like to talk about
my father

23:51.931 --> 23:54.590
more tragic
than what I'm going through.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.383
- Well, you know,
it's happening from the past.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.093
- It all sucks.
- It all sucks.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.720
- It all sucks.
- But you know what?

23:59.796 --> 24:01.889
But look, I'm here.
- Right.

traumatic death,

24:07.429 --> 24:09.730

26:36.620 --> 26:38.003
Oh-yi-yi.

- Honey, be careful.

everything for her, I'm there.

Of course
I'm going to help her!

27:06.125 --> 27:08.950
- You guys,
this is my sister helping me.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.461
Imagine you go
to Kathy Hilton's house,

27:10.537 --> 27:12.287

set her table like this?

27:12.298 --> 27:14.373
- A lemon for a paperweight

27:14.449 --> 27:16.458

- Is that for a paperweight?

I'm just telling you,

- Don't trust her.

She'll prank you.
- Don't put your teeth

27:20.381 --> 27:21.621

- I love it that the pool

27:21.699 --> 27:23.256

the golf course.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.633
- Oh, it's warm.
- Is it ready?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.385
- Actually, I would get in.

27:26.461 --> 27:28.470
I would not get in the pool,
but I would get in a hot tub.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.647

27:29.723 --> 27:31.598

like, try it out.

27:31.675 --> 27:33.058
- I like a hot tub.

27:33.135 --> 27:35.102
- I turned on the pool
for like three days

27:35.178 --> 27:37.604
to try to warm it up.
And then I got the bill--

27:37.681 --> 27:39.657
And then I was like, "Maybe..."
- And was it a lot?

27:39.733 --> 27:41.441
- It wasn't a lot.
It was just like--

27:41.518 --> 27:43.110
- More than you need
if you're not going to use it.

27:43.186 --> 27:44.778
- Well, how about this?
I kept the pool heated

27:44.855 --> 27:46.446
for 20 years
and never got in it.

27:46.523 --> 27:48.782
Never saw the bill.
I kept the pool heated

27:48.859 --> 27:51.335
for three days, saw the bill
and I was like, "(BLEEP) that."

27:51.412 --> 27:53.412
- It's a little different when
you see the bill, isn't it?

27:53.488 --> 27:55.414
- It's a little--it's a hell
of a lot different.

27:55.490 --> 27:57.499
When you see the bill,
I'm like, "What is this?"

27:57.510 --> 27:59.968
I am so tired.
I'm like, "Excuse me.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.180
Okay. We could have saved."
- Well...

28:03.257 --> 28:05.683
- Lia's like, "Really?
Is this who you've become?"

28:05.759 --> 28:07.300

- Well, it is.

[laughter]

28:32.736 --> 28:33.785

44:01.714 --> 44:03.798
- Guess what, bitch.
I'm not threatening.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.216
I'm promising.

44:05.292 --> 44:09.687
Look at me.
Look at my ----ing life.
